18
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,329

..wearing dhoti is so difficult.
- Shut up!

20
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:35,993

Did you send him somewhere?

30
00:03:05,966 --> 00:03:06,990
No one needs to send him anywhere.

31
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,692
He is wandering
outside all the times.

32
00:03:08,802 --> 00:03:09,928
Why do you scold him, uncle?

33
00:03:10,037 --> 00:03:12,437
Younger brother went to
call the videographer.

34
00:03:12,673 --> 00:03:13,662
Stop. Stop. This is the home.

35
00:03:14,575 --> 00:03:19,376
Brother is here. - lt's not
your brother, it's an idiot.

36
00:03:19,613 --> 00:03:21,706
How much?
- Chalis (forty). - Chalis?

37
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:24,681
lt's too less, sir. - lt's less?
Chalis means seventy, right?

38
00:03:28,155 --> 00:03:30,715
Challis means forty rupees.
- Forty rupees?

39
00:03:30,824 --> 00:03:31,984
Why didn't you tell me
that before he left?

40
00:03:32,092 --> 00:03:34,026
l lost 30 rupees.
- lt's your money.

41
00:03:35,662 --> 00:03:37,493
lt's yours. You
dropped your purse in auto.

42
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:38,653
Madam. Madam.

43
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:42,062
Wife should sit on the
left side of her husband.

44
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:44,603
Why so? - Because men keep their
wallets in their left pockets.

45
00:03:44,805 --> 00:03:47,865
ldiot. Heart is the most
important organ of our body.

46
00:03:48,442 --> 00:03:51,138
And it's on left side.
That's why a wife should..

47
00:03:51,411 --> 00:03:53,709
..sit on the left side
of husband like his heart.

48
00:03:53,814 --> 00:03:56,942
l see. What are you
staring at! Cover everything.

49
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,675

00:03:59,786 --> 00:04:01,617
Cover the uncles and
then cover the aunties.

51
00:04:01,722 --> 00:04:04,691

you stop covering the camera.

52
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:08,559
You brought the cameraman?
Where has this idiot gone?

53
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,907
Someone was to be
admitted in the hospital.

54
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:24,102
So he went there to
help them reach there.

55
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:34,118
Who are they?
- l don't know.

56
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:36,421
He doesn't tire praising his
you. He says that we should..

57
00:04:36,523 --> 00:04:38,991
..be helping others
like his uncle does.

58
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:28,872
No, don't beat me.

59
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:30,942
l beg you. Please.

60
00:05:33,013 --> 00:05:34,002
Come here.

61
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,816
Take it. Set him on fire.
- No.

62
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:38,907
You told her that you
would set her on fire..

63
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:40,008
..if she doesn't say 'l
love you' to you, right?

64
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,678
You think girls would
accept your proposals if you..

65
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:42,982
..threaten them with
stabbing and throwing acid on them?

66
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,715
Set him on fire.
- No, don't do that.

67
00:05:45,826 --> 00:05:48,294
When it came to you,
you are asking for mercy?

68
00:05:48,562 --> 00:05:51,030
lf you ever repeat
such a thing again..

69
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:54,191
Forgive me, brother. l beg you.
- Apologize there. Apologize.

70
00:05:54,868 --> 00:05:57,166
Forgive me.
- Go. Go.

71
00:05:58,305 --> 00:05:59,863
Thanks a lot, Chanti.
- You can thank me later.

72
00:05:59,973 --> 00:06:01,873
First of all take sister home.
l am about to get a class.

73
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:04,068
Class? Who will give you a class?
- My father.

74
00:06:04,177 --> 00:06:06,645
What is that?
- Lord's holy offering.

75
00:06:06,747 --> 00:06:08,874
That won't be enough for you.
Distribute it among everyone.

76
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:12,281
Don't laugh so much or
else we would give you..

77
00:06:12,552 --> 00:06:14,782
..100% discount in your bill.
- Padmavati. - Yes.

78
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:17,118
Where is Purushottam?
We need to give..

79
00:06:17,224 --> 00:06:19,055
..offerings to the priest.
- Your brother won't let you..

80
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:20,990
..take that trouble
as well? Look there.

81
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:22,250
You performed the vow
really well, priest.

82
00:06:30,937 --> 00:06:33,667
How did you come in, uncle?
- By climbing the pipe.

83
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,104
lf you want to come up in
life you have to climb pipes.

84
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:37,267
Practice it from now onwards..

85
00:06:37,344 --> 00:06:39,209
..and you will definitely
benefit it when you grow up.

86
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:41,144
One scoundrel a home is enough.

87
00:06:41,314 --> 00:06:42,838

Here is the Amitabh
Bachchan of this home.

89
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:48,712
Hey, stop there.
- Leave it, uncle.

90
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:50,780
Grandpa would scold you and
you'd put your head down..

91
00:06:50,891 --> 00:06:53,121
..shamelessly, it's an
everyday occurrence, uncle.

92
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:54,215
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

93
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:55,720
You are fighting even
on the day of the vow?

94
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:57,729
Can't you sleep in peace if
you don't beat someone or other?

95
00:06:57,831 --> 00:06:59,321
You won't change.
- lf you have so much faith in me..

96
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,725
..you earn a living for me, l will
lead a comfortable life at home.

97
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:01,858
That's what you
are doing now, right?

98
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:03,196
You wake up in the
morning and get into fights..

99
00:07:03,303 --> 00:07:05,203
..and then paint the town red.
- What?

100
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:07,605
You would never
listen to your father.

101
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:09,566
Won't you live in peace without
getting scolded by your father?

102
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,207
What's your age and what
do you think you are doing?

103
00:07:14,047 --> 00:07:15,776
l talked like that
because your father was here.

104
00:07:15,882 --> 00:07:17,713
You didn't feel bad, did you?
- l don't feel bad..

105
00:07:17,818 --> 00:07:19,649
..even if he says hundred
things, but if you say..

106

00:12:16,683 --> 00:12:18,275
l didn't ask you about
good for nothing fellows.

169
00:12:18,384 --> 00:12:20,113
Did anyone useful for us come here?

170
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,450
Nani, you are talking too much.

171
00:12:22,555 --> 00:12:23,579
l will hit you and you will..

172
00:12:24,524 --> 00:12:26,355
Order two teas.
- You don't want Boost?

173
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:29,326
Hey, two cups of Boost!
- Hey, stop it! l was kidding.

174
00:12:29,662 --> 00:12:31,562
Nani, don't mess with it
without knowing about it.

175
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:33,495
lt's the silencer. You
have to fix a new one.

176
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,536
Hello! l know my job well.

177
00:12:37,637 --> 00:12:40,105
When l started out here you
weren't even in your nappies.

178
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:41,230
You don't wear underwear even now.

179
00:12:42,675 --> 00:12:45,405
Hey, Nani, is the car ready?
- ls the cash ready?

180
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:47,104
l have the cash.
- Ok.

181
00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:50,871
Hey, the party's here.
Already this shed got a bad rap..

182
00:12:50,984 --> 00:12:52,645
..due to your presence. l
talk, quarrel and fight..

183
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:55,353
..with my customers.
You don't get into it.

184
00:12:55,488 --> 00:12:59,424
Look, you can't cross this line.
You got it? Get out of here.

185
00:12:59,526 --> 00:13:03,428
Hey, bring a chair for sir.
- No, thanks. l need to go fast.

186
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,225
There's a settlement case pending.
- One minute, bro.

187
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:07,663
Hey, bring a coconut.
- But l don't drink coconut water.

188
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:09,595
l am not offering you
coconut water to drink, brother.

189
00:13:09,702 --> 00:13:12,000
To ward off the evil eye.
- l don't have such superstitions.

190
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:13,936
But l have, brother. l
never deliver a car..

191
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,940
..without warding off the
evil eye from the car, brother.

192
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:17,407
l am getting late.
l need to go fast.

193
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,034
lf we don't ward off the evil
eye you time might be up, brother.

194
00:13:19,145 --> 00:13:20,612
Listen to me.
- Ok, carry on.

195
00:13:20,713 --> 00:13:22,476
Hey, bring the coconut.
- Here it is, brother.

196
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:41,629
Hey, you ! l was rushing to
go to the settlement case..

197
00:13:41,734 --> 00:13:44,532
..and you broke my car's
glass with your sentiment?

198
00:13:44,637 --> 00:13:49,267
Hey, you ! l will kill
you. l will kill you.

199
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:51,309
Hey, if you don't repair
my car within an hour..

200
00:13:51,411 --> 00:13:53,242
..and deliver it to my
home l am going to kill you.

201
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:58,082
Hey! He was bashing me
up and you didn't even..

202
00:13:58,184 --> 00:14:00,982
..come forward to stop him?
- You told us strictly..

203
00:14:01,087 --> 00:14:02,748
..not to cross the line. We
followed your instructions.

204
00:14:03,022 --> 00:14:05,149
That is what is called friendship.
- Yes.

205
00:14:05,258 --> 00:14:08,557
You scoundrels! Hey, Pappu !
- Bring some bandages.

206
00:14:08,661 --> 00:14:12,427
22 acres of land
near Samshabad airport..

207
00:14:12,532 --> 00:14:15,365
..is being auctioned. The
starting price is 50 crores.

208
00:14:15,435 --> 00:14:18,802
55 crores.
- Rasi Builders, 55 crores.

209
00:14:19,072 --> 00:14:22,166
60 crores.
- Vandana Builders, 60 crores.

210
00:14:22,442 --> 00:14:24,603
65 crores.
- 100 crores.

211
00:14:43,296 --> 00:14:45,321
He's here. lt's a disaster now.

212
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:48,193
He raised it to 100 crores at
once. What's there to say now?

213
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:50,360
He came here only to
raise the price, brother.

214
00:14:50,803 --> 00:14:53,670
Shall we stop, sir?
- Keep rising our quotation..

215
00:14:53,773 --> 00:14:56,333
..till l stop you.
- 100,00,00,001 rupees.

216
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:59,775
lt's not an auction anymore.
lt's a battle.

217
00:15:00,046 --> 00:15:02,537
110 crores.
- Umapati Builders, 110 crores.

218
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:05,277
110,00,00,001 rupees.
- Buying that land..

219
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:07,182
..at this price is of no use.
lt's already too high.

220
00:15:07,287 --> 00:15:08,345
Let's drop it here.

221
00:15:10,456 --> 00:15:12,481
120 crores.
- Umapati Builders..

222
00:15:12,592 --> 00:15:14,389
He doesn't listen to
anyone other than his wife.

223
00:15:14,494 --> 00:15:17,463
120,00,00,001 rupees.
- He is a crazy man to raise it..

224
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,622
..but what happened
to these R.K. guys.

225
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:21,291
They are raising it like anything.
- 150 crores.

226
00:15:23,403 --> 00:15:25,496
He's in trouble.
- Umapati Builders, 150 crores.

227
00:15:25,605 --> 00:15:29,632
lt goes once. Umapati
Builders, 150 crores.

228
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:33,839
lt goes twice.
- 150,00,00,001 rupees.

229
00:15:34,647 --> 00:15:39,175
R. K. Builders,

230
00:15:42,255 --> 00:15:43,244
lt goes thrice.

231
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:53,488
With this that Rama
Krishna lost 50 crores.

232
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:58,100
Even if l didn't gain
anything my enemy lost a lot.

233
00:15:58,571 --> 00:16:00,505
l am very happy now.

234
00:16:05,445 --> 00:16:07,606
Hello! - lt's me, Murthy.
The land is yours, right?

235
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:10,277
The matter leaked from
CM's office just now.

236
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,450
The government is about to build
an lT-park.. ..near that land.

237
00:16:12,885 --> 00:16:14,682
The papers have been signed
as well in the secretariat.

238
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:17,356
That land's value is
more than 200 crores now.

239
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:35,738
Sir, l told you about it as
soon as the papers were signed.

240
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:38,370
After a woman delivers the baby..

241
00:16:38,478 --> 00:16:40,309
..even a ward boy can tell
if it's a boy or a girl.

242
00:16:40,947 --> 00:16:42,244
l need a doctor who could scan..

243
00:16:42,348 --> 00:16:44,282
..and tell me the gender
when the baby is in the womb.

244
00:16:45,852 --> 00:16:47,877
He might die, sir. You
are getting so upset..

245
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:51,146
..for losing just one tender?
- lt's not a newborn anger.

246
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,156
lt's 20 year old anger.

247
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:56,592
Still l can't forget how
Rama Krishna insulted me.

248
00:16:57,196 --> 00:16:58,527
l didn't take the
water-tank contract..

249
00:16:58,631 --> 00:17:01,429
..being the president of this
village and gave it to you..

250
00:17:01,534 --> 00:17:03,365
..and you in return
exploited a poor laborer..

251
00:17:03,469 --> 00:17:04,663
..who came to work for a living?

252
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:07,228
l made a mistake in
haste. Forgive me.

253
00:17:07,774 --> 00:17:10,937
For misbehaving with
a female laborer..

254
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:14,179
..l touched Rama Krishna's
feet and begged for forgiveness.

255
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:18,681
But he instead of
forgiving me got me beaten up..

256
00:17:18,785 --> 00:17:20,616
..by everyone in the
middle of the village..

257
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:22,244
..and expelled me from the village.

258
00:17:22,955 --> 00:17:26,686
l will make him pay for
every blow on my body.

259
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:30,921
That's why l won't be hurt
even if l lose 100 crores..

260
00:17:30,997 --> 00:17:33,966
..but even if that Rama
Krishna gains one single rupee..

261
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:35,894
..l can't bear it.

262
00:17:40,773 --> 00:17:43,003
This is the only thing your
brother-in-law does perfectly.

263
00:17:43,743 --> 00:17:45,574
lf he could hear us the
hammer would turn this side.

264
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:50,980
l decided to sacrifice a goat
for the new building. lt's done.

265
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:01,425
Shailu.
- Yes, coming, mother.

266
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:12,462
Has sister fallen in love?

267
00:18:12,905 --> 00:18:14,463
She didn't tell me
such an important thing?

268
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:17,307
lf she hadn't told me about it
how can she tell our parents!

269
00:18:17,877 --> 00:18:20,402
l will have to talk to
uncle and convince him.

270
00:18:20,513 --> 00:18:21,571
She's my only sister.

271
00:18:22,782 --> 00:18:27,776
Chanti, you are such a
responsible guy. Uncle.

272
00:18:27,887 --> 00:18:32,051
You like him?
- Sorry for the interruption.

273
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,725
You don't get tensed after
hearing what l say. - What?

274
00:18:34,994 --> 00:18:37,462
Love is like a rose. lt
gives fragrance if we grow it..

275
00:18:37,563 --> 00:18:39,394
..and it hurts us
if we try to cut it.

276
00:18:39,532 --> 00:18:42,399
Love is a feeling.
lt's born only one.

277
00:18:42,702 --> 00:18:43,896
And it is there with
us till our death.

278
00:18:44,337 --> 00:18:46,464
We shouldn't separate those in love.

279
00:18:46,572 --> 00:18:48,733
Cut the crap. You are in love?

280
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:50,604
lt's not me, brother.
- Then who?

281
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,699
Our Shailu.

282
00:18:56,849 --> 00:19:00,580
What are you saying?
- Yes, uncle. Shailu loves a guy.

283
00:19:00,686 --> 00:19:02,449
Did she tell you?
- Anyone would know it on telling.

284
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:03,715
Only if we find it out
before she tells us..

285
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:04,983
..we are her true well-wishers.
You want proof?

286
00:19:06,926 --> 00:19:07,893
He looks like a king, right?

287
00:19:08,361 --> 00:19:11,922
Without building the barriers
of wealth, caste and religion..

288
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:14,693
..get them married and
save your reputation.

289
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:20,270
Why is everyone
looking at me in that way?

290
00:19:20,373 --> 00:19:22,568
lnstead of staring at you,
you want us to felicitate you..

291
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:26,076
..for your great deed. He's
the guy we selected for Shailu.

292
00:19:29,448 --> 00:19:31,814
You got us all tensed for no reason.

293
00:19:32,118 --> 00:19:33,915
Tomorrow we are going to our
village for the Shankranti.

294
00:19:34,053 --> 00:19:36,954
We are thinking of fixing a date
for the wedding after we return.

295
00:19:37,356 --> 00:19:38,345
You heard that, didn't you?

296
00:19:38,658 --> 00:19:40,819
The train is at 4 O' clock tomorrow.

297
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,622
Don't go anywhere. Stay at home.

298
00:19:42,795 --> 00:19:45,662
l overacted without
knowing the matter.

299
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:47,330
You idiot.

300
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:52,369
Hey, you used to ride
a bulldozer earlier?

301
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:53,961
Won't your auto go faster?
Driver faster.

302
00:19:54,073 --> 00:19:55,097
What's the matter? Are
we going to Rajamundry..

303
00:19:55,374 --> 00:19:56,534
..on the auto?
- Shut up!

304
00:19:56,676 --> 00:19:58,007
We got late for the train as
you were putting make-up..

305
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,941
..on your ugly face, or else
we would've gone with them.

306
00:20:00,046 --> 00:20:01,035
O really! lf we had gone with them..

307
00:20:01,147 --> 00:20:03,513
..they would've
thought that we are rogues.

308
00:20:03,683 --> 00:20:05,514
Only if we go late we would
be maintaining some level.

309
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:08,445
Hey! l bought that
with my uncle's money.

310
00:20:08,955 --> 00:20:10,980
We bought this as well
with his money. - Wine?

311
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,955
lt's not about wine
or something else..

312
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:14,117
What matter is if we have
it or not when we needed it!

313
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:15,485
l see.
- That's what we should worry about.

314
00:20:15,595 --> 00:20:18,428
Listen, for others it's water,
but for it's quarter.

315
00:20:18,497 --> 00:20:21,057
Listen, we might travel on
train without a ticket..

316
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:23,067
..but without liquor l
can't travel anywhere.

317
00:20:25,938 --> 00:20:27,633
Come. We might miss the train.
Get down. Get down.

318
00:20:28,374 --> 00:20:29,739
Here's the money. - Hey, you
drunkard, give him the money..

319
00:20:29,842 --> 00:20:30,831
..and come fast.
- l'm coming.

320
00:20:31,711 --> 00:20:33,076
Sir, which platform will
Godavari Express come on?

321
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:34,874
Five.
- lt's five. Come fast.

322
00:20:35,214 --> 00:20:38,342
Six. Seven. Eight. Nine.

323
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:40,111
Come fast. Come fast.
- Stop. l can't run.

324
00:20:43,756 --> 00:20:44,745
l am sorry.

325
00:20:45,725 --> 00:20:46,987
Come on ! There's no
need to touch my feet.

326
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:48,082
You already said sorry.

327
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:51,120
She bent to take her ticket.
You are expecting too much.

328
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,925
You think so?
- You don't think so?

329
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:55,394
The girl's beautiful. You
won't think so. - Shut up!

330
00:20:55,635 --> 00:20:58,069
l am sorry. l was
getting late for Godavari.

331
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,159
So l couldn't see you in the rush.

332
00:20:59,438 --> 00:21:00,530
We are also going on Godavari.

333
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,471
Did you see this? You and we
are getting into the same train.

334
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:03,564
We would also get
down from the train.

335
00:21:03,643 --> 00:21:04,701
lt's on platform no. 5. Come.

336
00:21:04,877 --> 00:21:07,437
No, Godavari is on platform no. 3.

337
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:09,878
Who's that fool who told you?
- The guy in the counter..

338
00:21:09,982 --> 00:21:13,110
The TTE told us.
- Alright. You may go then.

339
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:14,846
You will get down in
Kolkata or Kashmir..

340
00:21:14,954 --> 00:21:17,013
..and then you will be happy.
- Srinu, the train's moving.

341
00:21:17,123 --> 00:21:19,557
Come. Come. Come. Come. Come on.
- Come fast.

342
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:22,086
Hey, wait. l will get in first.

343
00:21:23,596 --> 00:21:24,756
Be careful. Be careful. Be careful.

344
00:21:29,235 --> 00:21:31,135
Thanks a lot. lf you
hadn't bumped into me..

345
00:21:31,237 --> 00:21:33,137
..l would've missed the train.

346
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:35,503
l didn't miss the train
intentionally. - lt's alright.

347
00:21:35,608 --> 00:21:36,939
You didn't do it intentionally,
but it turned out..

348
00:21:37,043 --> 00:21:38,874
..to be good for me.
- Hey, there are some elephants..

349
00:21:38,978 --> 00:21:41,776
..sitting on our seats.
- We will kick them out.

350
00:21:41,881 --> 00:21:43,439
We will kick them out.
You come in. You come in.

351
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:48,842
We were late by just two minutes..

352
00:21:48,954 --> 00:21:49,943
..and you occupied our seats?
- You know whose seats..

353
00:21:50,056 --> 00:21:51,990
..these are? - Or did you still
sit there intentionally? Get up.

354
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:53,956
No, no. These are our seats.
We have reservation.

355
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,119
Check these. - Hey, they
got into Godavari Express..

356
00:21:56,195 --> 00:21:58,095
..to go to Mumbai.

357
00:21:58,698 --> 00:22:01,963
They have huge bodies, but
there is nothing in their brain.

358
00:22:02,068 --> 00:22:03,501
We got the train late, but
we got into the right one.

359
00:22:03,602 --> 00:22:05,126
Were you sleeping while
getting in? Get up. - Get up.

360
00:22:05,237 --> 00:22:06,727
No, brother.
- No, brother?

361
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:09,205
What's your problem? They
are getting up. Get up. Get up.

362
00:22:09,742 --> 00:22:11,573
Get up.
- Hey, get down at next station..

363
00:22:11,677 --> 00:22:13,804
..before the TTE comes or
else he will give you a bill.

364
00:22:14,113 --> 00:22:17,105
ldiots. Foolish fatsos.

365
00:22:17,817 --> 00:22:20,615
lf you weren't there l would've
also got into the wrong train.

366
00:22:20,886 --> 00:22:23,286
Actually.. - You say you were
lucky that l bumped into you.

367
00:22:23,556 --> 00:22:25,524
Basically l have a
great helping nature.

368
00:22:25,624 --> 00:22:27,216
That's a bit too much.
- You take as much as you want.

369
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,791
Ticket. Ticket. - Mr. TTE,
these fatsos got in this train..

370
00:22:29,895 --> 00:22:32,125
..by mistake.
Leave them. Leave them.

371
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:34,529
Just for the sake of humanity.
- Where is your ticket?

372
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:35,656
Show them.
- Here it is.

373
00:22:35,768 --> 00:22:38,601
You get into Mumbai Express
with Godavari Express' ticket?

374
00:22:39,638 --> 00:22:41,765
The TTE also got
into the wrong train.

375
00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:43,731
l'm not the one who got into
the wrong train, but it's you.

376
00:22:45,745 --> 00:22:48,270
What are you saying, sir!
- This is a Mumbai-train, girl.

377
00:22:52,852 --> 00:22:53,841
Sir, sir, sir,
please check it again.

378
00:22:53,953 --> 00:22:55,887
A TTE like you told us that
Godavari's on platform no. 5.

379
00:22:56,021 --> 00:22:59,479
Who is that?
- 998.

380
00:22:59,692 --> 00:23:02,991
Sir, sir, sir, it's him. lt's him.
- 1000.

381
00:23:03,596 --> 00:23:05,962
lt's him? He became mad
after he lost his job.

382
00:23:06,065 --> 00:23:07,930
He just gets on and off trains.

383
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:10,567
l told them that
Godavari is on platform no. 3.

384
00:23:10,636 --> 00:23:12,604
And they scared me
and brought me here.

385
00:23:12,705 --> 00:23:14,195
Really? As if you are a hot chick.

386
00:23:14,273 --> 00:23:15,262
Yes, we thought of
selling you in Mumbai.

387
00:23:15,574 --> 00:23:17,633
You can fight later on.
First of all pay fine.

388
00:23:17,743 --> 00:23:19,643
He wants you to pay fine.
- No, l won't.

389
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:21,076
lf you won't pay up you'll have
to spend six months in the jail.

390
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,169
ln the jail?

391
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:24,876
l never went to the jail.
- We live in the jail.

392
00:23:24,984 --> 00:23:26,781
We come out once in a while. You..

393
00:23:26,886 --> 00:23:28,513
How much is the fine?
- 3,000 rupees for the three of you.

394
00:23:28,621 --> 00:23:29,610
l have got only 3,000 rupees.

395
00:23:30,022 --> 00:23:31,683
We will get down
in the next station.

396
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:32,951
Will you give us
refund us 2,000 rupees?

397
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:34,958
That bill is to get
down at the next station.

398
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,823
lf you want to go
further l will come again.

399
00:23:36,896 --> 00:23:39,023
Take it.
- You are a kind man, sir.

400
00:23:39,198 --> 00:23:40,358
You carry on, sir. We will get down.

401
00:23:42,868 --> 00:23:46,736
He held my collar.
- You are scared of their size?

402
00:23:47,006 --> 00:23:48,564
Ask them to touch me, l
will hit them so hard..

403
00:23:48,674 --> 00:23:49,663
..that they will fall outside.

404
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:51,370
O God!

405
00:23:51,977 --> 00:23:54,207
You are alive because
you are running away..

406
00:23:54,313 --> 00:23:56,781
..or else l would've killed you.
- Get up. Get up. Get up.

407
00:23:57,149 --> 00:23:58,138
lt's my misfortune
that l bumped into you..

408
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,115
..even though there was so
many people on that station.

409
00:24:00,219 --> 00:24:01,584
You bumped into me and
got into the wrong train.

410
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:02,676
Had you bumped into someone else..

411
00:24:02,788 --> 00:24:04,688
..he would've taken you to
some other place and did that.

412
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,121
l know what to do in such case.

413
00:24:06,225 --> 00:24:07,886
Yes, you are Bruce Lee.
- You want to see.

414
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,861
No, Miss, you need not
show him your manliness.

415
00:24:10,963 --> 00:24:12,590
Hey, l will find out
when we will get a train..

416
00:24:12,665 --> 00:24:15,156
..and till then both of you
maintain some distance. - Ok.

417
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:17,292
You are telling him? l
won't let him come close to me.

418
00:24:17,403 --> 00:24:18,836
l am allergic to even his breathe.

419
00:24:18,938 --> 00:24:20,200
Oh !
- Get lost.

420
00:24:30,082 --> 00:24:32,778
Hold your breath for a while,
it will go. - Hiccups?

421
00:24:32,885 --> 00:24:34,045
Your life. And world
will be a better place.

422
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,397
Hey, you !

423
00:24:50,703 --> 00:24:54,195
Hey, you !
- Me? - Yes, you.

424
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,731
You think l am mad to call
someone else in that way..

425
00:24:56,842 --> 00:25:00,039
..when a scoundrel like
you is next to me? - Really!

426
00:25:00,212 --> 00:25:02,908
lt's working.
- What's working?

427
00:25:03,082 --> 00:25:05,016
What did you say a while ago?
- What did l say?

428
00:25:05,184 --> 00:25:08,017
That you would take me to
Mumbai and sell me there?

429
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:14,021
Who do you think l am?
- Bhanumati from Turredu.

430
00:25:14,326 --> 00:25:15,691
When l was just 13 years old l..

431
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:21,197
Just like that. Everyone in my
village looked at me in that way.

432
00:25:21,367 --> 00:25:23,301
l gave them a hard time.

433
00:25:24,136 --> 00:25:26,866
l will give you as well a hard time.

434
00:25:27,907 --> 00:25:29,272
l will sell you in the market..

435
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:32,674
..and l will buy a ribbon, a ribbon.

436
00:25:33,178 --> 00:25:34,167
Till now l thought
she is a city-girl..

437
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,680
..but her originality came
out once she had liquor. - Hey!

438
00:25:37,783 --> 00:25:38,772
Water.
- l won't give you.

439
00:25:38,884 --> 00:25:39,976
Give me!
- l won't.

440
00:25:40,386 --> 00:25:42,877
Give me. You won't give me?
- l won't.

441
00:25:42,955 --> 00:25:44,286
You won't give me?
- l will never give you.

442
00:25:45,758 --> 00:25:48,818
This scoundrel is not
giving water to a poor girl.

443
00:25:48,961 --> 00:25:50,690
When l was just 13 years old l..

444
00:25:51,297 --> 00:25:52,286
He is not giving me water..

445
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:54,798
..even though when l
was just 13 years old l..

446
00:25:56,201 --> 00:25:57,395
Brothers and sisters!

447
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,870
Ladies and gentlemen !
- O God!

448
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,337
Wait. Wait. Wait. Take the water.

449
00:26:02,441 --> 00:26:04,409
Get down. Get down.

450
00:26:04,476 --> 00:26:06,876
Take it. Take it. Drink it and die.

451
00:26:12,318 --> 00:26:13,307
O God!

452
00:26:17,523 --> 00:26:18,512
Bhanumati.

453
00:26:19,525 --> 00:26:20,822
Knife.

454
00:26:29,902 --> 00:26:32,871
l need to have a drink
or else l won't.. Hey!

455
00:26:33,505 --> 00:26:34,995
ls this what you call
maintaining distance?

456
00:26:35,441 --> 00:26:36,430
lt's not been even two
minutes since l left..

457
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:38,442
..and she already fell for you?
- You will fall if l tell you how.

458
00:26:38,978 --> 00:26:41,276
l won't fall. Tell me.
- She drank your liquor.

459
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,369
O God! lf l knew
that she too drinks..

460
00:26:42,481 --> 00:26:44,506
..l would've bought half
bottle liquor. - Leave it.

461
00:26:44,783 --> 00:26:45,943
She got hiccups and she
drank it assuming it to be water.

462
00:26:46,051 --> 00:26:47,177
Tell me when the train is coming.

463
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:49,354
What for the train? We
are on the wrong route.

464
00:26:49,521 --> 00:26:51,819
About two kilometers
from here we will get buses.

465
00:26:51,957 --> 00:26:52,946
How do we handle her now?

466
00:26:53,325 --> 00:26:54,815
l will carry the
luggage like a donkey..

467
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:56,861
..and you carry her like an idiot.
- Rascal!

468
00:26:58,831 --> 00:26:59,820
Ticket. Ticket.

469
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,034
Hey, he's asking us to
take a ticket. - Buy one.

470
00:27:04,937 --> 00:27:05,926
lf l bring money
when l am with you..

471
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:07,903
..it would be an insult to you,
that's why l didn't bring it.

472
00:27:08,007 --> 00:27:09,440
l gave all my money to the TTE.

473
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:11,099
Then check her handbag.
- lt's been a long time..

474
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,041
..since l checked it.
There are nothing except..

475
00:27:13,145 --> 00:27:14,305
..pins,
rubber-bands, stickers in it.

476
00:27:15,147 --> 00:27:17,980
Hey, who said women
have become modern?

477
00:27:18,283 --> 00:27:19,807
Their dressing must have
changed, but the place..

478
00:27:19,885 --> 00:27:22,752
..where they keep their
money hasn't changed. Look there.

479
00:27:23,522 --> 00:27:25,490
But how?
- With your hand.

480
00:27:26,091 --> 00:27:28,116
You need my help for
this? Take it out.

481
00:27:28,427 --> 00:27:30,258
There is no other way?
- Hey, l will tear my clothes..

482
00:27:30,362 --> 00:27:33,854
..and go to
Rajamundry begging everyone.

483
00:27:33,932 --> 00:27:36,127
And then you will have to
put her on your shoulder and..

484
00:27:36,235 --> 00:27:37,827
Hey, don't scare me. l will try.

485
00:27:41,807 --> 00:27:43,798
Hey, it's very difficult.
- What! Putting your hand inside..

486
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:46,173
..or taking it out?
- Ticket, ticket.

487
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:48,246
l got it.
- Then take it out.

488
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,569
Okay.

489
00:27:50,983 --> 00:27:52,075
Ticket, ticket.

490
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:56,946
Three tickets to Rajamundry.
- Ticket, ticket.

491
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:00,947
What are you doing?

492
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,593
l'm keeping it back.
- Stop.

493
00:28:03,028 --> 00:28:04,928
We have to buy half bottle
wine if we get a wine shop..

494
00:28:04,997 --> 00:28:05,986
..on the way.
- Rascal, if it's your money..

495
00:28:06,098 --> 00:28:07,087
..you buy quarter bottle wine
and if it's someone else's..

496
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:08,223
..you buy half bottle?
- Hey, shut up!

497
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,389
lt's only quarter for me,
but if she gets up..

498
00:28:09,501 --> 00:28:10,525
..she would shout at me
and we would give her..

499
00:28:10,636 --> 00:28:11,796
..quarter bottle wine
and she would become calm.

500
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,532
lt's wrong. My uncle
said that stealing is wrong.

501
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,032
l will keep it back.
- Ok, keep it back. What can l do?

502
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,469
O God!

503
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:26,143
Ticket, ticket! Take your
ticket! Sir, your tickets.

504
00:28:26,318 --> 00:28:28,013
Ten rupees per head
and thirty for you three.

505
00:28:28,153 --> 00:28:29,882
Buy the tickets.
- Ok, we will buy the tickets..

506
00:28:29,988 --> 00:28:31,649
..but you pay the money.
- You're the ones..

507
00:28:31,924 --> 00:28:33,016
..who got me into the wrong
train. You buy the tickets.

508
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:34,217
We carried your burden
you from Rajamundry.

509
00:28:34,326 --> 00:28:35,315
Now you want us to
carry you till your home?

510
00:28:35,427 --> 00:28:36,860
We don't have any money.
- l too don't have any money.

511
00:28:36,929 --> 00:28:37,918
We know there's no money there.

512
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,156
There you have 700 rupees.
Take it out.

513
00:28:39,431 --> 00:28:42,628
700? But it should be 2,000 rupees.
- That's right.

514
00:28:42,935 --> 00:28:44,232
But when we got into the
bus the conductor asked..

515
00:28:44,336 --> 00:28:46,236
..money for the tickets
and you were deep in sleep..

516
00:28:46,305 --> 00:28:48,102
So l didn't want to
disturb you, so l took money..

517
00:28:48,207 --> 00:28:50,038
..from your purse over there.
After we bought the tickets..

518
00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:51,974
..we thought we
shouldn't take others' money..

519
00:28:52,044 --> 00:28:53,875
..so l kept it back there.
Then he stopped the bus..

520
00:28:53,979 --> 00:28:55,640
..at 9 O' clock for breakfast
l took money from there again..

521
00:28:55,914 --> 00:28:56,903
..and ate parathas and
since we didn't want to..

522
00:28:57,015 --> 00:28:58,107
..take others' money
l kept it back there.

523
00:28:58,884 --> 00:29:00,476
At 1 O' clock l think.. He
stopped the bus for lunch..

524
00:29:00,586 --> 00:29:02,417
..so l took it out again
and had tea.. - And thought..

525
00:29:02,521 --> 00:29:05,149
..you shouldn't take
others' money and kept it back?

526
00:29:05,257 --> 00:29:06,281
You are right.
- To take money from here..

527
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:08,450
..whenever you wish you
think some it's an ATM?

528
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,549
O God!

529
00:29:11,497 --> 00:29:12,486
Chanti.

530
00:29:18,971 --> 00:29:20,632
You're here?
- Yes, l am here..

531
00:29:20,739 --> 00:29:23,071
..but first you stop
keeping money over there.

532
00:29:23,175 --> 00:29:25,143
Why?
- Thieves might steal it.

533
00:29:25,244 --> 00:29:26,506
Who would steal it from here?

534
00:29:26,612 --> 00:29:28,546
Both my mom and grandma
used to keep money here.

535
00:29:28,614 --> 00:29:30,639
That's what had put me in trouble.
- What happened?

536
00:29:31,316 --> 00:29:33,511
Nothing really.
- Bhanu, why are you late?

537
00:29:34,219 --> 00:29:37,347
l didn't get the train, daddy.
- There are number of trains.

538
00:29:37,723 --> 00:29:39,554
And yes, how longer will you study?

539
00:29:39,758 --> 00:29:41,419
For three more months.
- Still three more months?

540
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:43,888
Ok, go inside and get
fresh and eat something.

541
00:29:46,732 --> 00:29:48,597
We need to get her married as
soon as her studies are over.

542
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,464
She is a young girl. Find out
if there is anyone in her heart.

543
00:29:51,637 --> 00:29:53,002
So that we could get
her married to him?

544
00:29:53,672 --> 00:29:55,435
No, so that we could
make her forget him.

545
00:29:56,041 --> 00:29:58,168
l got her admitted in a
city-college not to get her..

546
00:29:58,277 --> 00:30:01,440
..married to some idiot, but to
find an America-match for her.

547
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:07,180
Hey, bring me down. My head is sp
inning. Don't kill me.

548
00:30:08,787 --> 00:30:10,982
So Pushpa darling, is that ok?

549
00:30:11,223 --> 00:30:12,713
When l was a kid you
used to ask me to marry you.

550
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:15,426
Will you marry me now?
- So you wanted to kill me..

551
00:30:15,527 --> 00:30:18,519
..to marry her? - What's the
use even if you are alive?

552
00:30:19,131 --> 00:30:20,257
What are you saying!
They used to say..

553
00:30:20,332 --> 00:30:21,663
..that your husband was the
best wrestler of the village.

554
00:30:21,767 --> 00:30:23,132
That was once upon a time.
lt was a sight to behold..

555
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:25,226
..when he used to show
the tricks with the stick.

556
00:30:25,771 --> 00:30:29,104
But now he can't even lift
a stick. Who is this kid?

557
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:32,268
My name is Srinu, l am his friend.
- He is so sweet.

558
00:30:32,678 --> 00:30:35,442
l have got some fans in
your village. Am l so sweet?

559
00:30:35,647 --> 00:30:38,207
You are as sweet as our dog.

560
00:30:39,351 --> 00:30:41,581
How rude she is! Who are they?

561
00:30:41,753 --> 00:30:43,448
They look after our farms
and house in our village.

562
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:46,018
Let's go inside. Pushpa darling,
we shall catch up later.

563
00:30:46,124 --> 00:30:47,557
l will try my best to avoid you.

564
00:30:47,693 --> 00:30:50,127
Why hasn't this idiot come yet?
- He is here.

565
00:30:50,229 --> 00:30:53,221
Father can't stay without me.
- lt's not me, it's your uncle.

566
00:30:53,298 --> 00:30:54,287
Your uncle has been
asking since morning..

567
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,094
..whether you have come
or not. Go and meet him.

568
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,599
Uncle, if you select a
nice matching shirt..

569
00:30:58,704 --> 00:31:00,535
..l will get ready soon.
- Hey, my brother looks..

570
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:02,766
..like a fashion designer to you?

571
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:04,531
Fashion started with my uncle.

572
00:31:05,477 --> 00:31:07,308
l heard when he was young
girls used to chase him..

573
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:09,279
..like bees whichever
dress he used to wear.

574
00:31:09,781 --> 00:31:11,544
l am also thinking of
following the same path.

575
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,675
Great. No one needs to
teach you such things though.

576
00:31:14,152 --> 00:31:15,141
You are plain jealous.

577
00:31:16,588 --> 00:31:19,182
Ok, thanks for giving me
the good news, goodbye.

578
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:21,616
What is it? - He says that land
we lost in auction a few days..

579
00:31:21,727 --> 00:31:24,753
..ago is not worth 250 crores,
but it's worth 400 crores.

580
00:31:32,404 --> 00:31:33,598
Call my brother.

581
00:31:37,576 --> 00:31:39,100
Brother.
- Yes, brother.

582
00:31:39,211 --> 00:31:44,342
l couldn't harm that Rama
Krishna since past 20 years.

583
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:48,143
l heard that he came to our
village along with his family.

584
00:31:48,754 --> 00:31:50,483
You must insult him in the village..

585
00:31:50,589 --> 00:31:53,387
..he was born and brought up.
- Along with his reputation..

586
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:55,517
..he would also
lose his hand or leg.

587
00:31:56,295 --> 00:31:59,230
l will give you this news very soon.

588
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:03,727
He is my brother. - l hope you
won't take your words tomorrow.

589
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:14,243
Greetings. - l'm here round
the year, but no one salutes me.

590
00:32:14,346 --> 00:32:16,405
And you in spite of being here
for just couple of days a year..

591
00:32:16,515 --> 00:32:18,415
..people salute you and
touch your feet, brother-in-law.

592
00:32:18,517 --> 00:32:19,779
That's my brother's greatness.

593
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:28,251
Hey, Rama Krishna!

594
00:32:30,796 --> 00:32:32,696
What's wrong with you ! You
are calling an elderly man..

595
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:35,198
..with his first name?
What is wrong with you?

596
00:32:35,534 --> 00:32:38,401
lf you enter the battlefield you
will know what's wrong with me.

597
00:32:40,238 --> 00:32:42,331
What are you staring at!
l heard you used to..

598
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:44,875
..fight with a lot when
you were young. Come forward.

599
00:32:45,344 --> 00:32:48,336
Let's have a small fight.
- You wanna fight? - Chanti.

600
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:52,641
Hey, you're getting
angry when l abuse him?

601
00:32:52,918 --> 00:32:57,252
Hey, if you have courage
dare to touch even one of us.

602
00:32:57,756 --> 00:33:00,554
lf you win l will leave
this village and if l win..

603
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:03,457
..you will have to welcome
my brother whom you expelled..

604
00:33:03,562 --> 00:33:07,430
..back into this village
with a garland in your hand.

605
00:33:09,668 --> 00:33:12,228
Ok? - What are you still
waiting for, brother-in-law?

606
00:33:12,471 --> 00:33:14,735
Break his hands and legs, this
village will get rid of a nuisance.

607
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,831
We came to this village
to celebrate Shankranti..

608
00:33:16,942 --> 00:33:19,274
..but not fight people.
Come on, Chanti.

609
00:33:21,913 --> 00:33:24,245
What's the matter you are
stepping back like sissies?

610
00:33:24,383 --> 00:33:26,146
You came here on Shankranti.

611
00:33:26,284 --> 00:33:28,514
You should at least have
as much courage as cocks.

612
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,347
Don't you eat salt and pepper?

613
00:33:30,455 --> 00:33:32,355
Uncle, he is crossing the line.

614
00:33:32,457 --> 00:33:34,425
No, he wants us to cross the line.

615
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,157
Just wearing a molatadu
(black thread around waist)..

616
00:33:36,261 --> 00:33:39,128
..isn't enough, you need
to have manliness as well.

617
00:34:14,466 --> 00:34:15,592
You dared us to hit
at least one of you..

618
00:34:15,901 --> 00:34:18,802
l will leave none of
you. Come forward!

619
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:32,770
What did you say a while ago?
Cock. Molatadu. Manliness.

620
00:35:35,013 --> 00:35:36,275
Show me your manliness.

621
00:35:36,915 --> 00:35:38,439
l want to see your manliness.

622
00:35:38,717 --> 00:35:42,847
lf l get that stick again
l will insert it into you.

623
00:35:43,588 --> 00:35:44,577
Show me.

624
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:03,974
Take that stick. Take it. Take it!

625
00:36:28,934 --> 00:36:31,835
No, no.

626
00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:39,132
Chanti, stop it.
Will you never change?

627
00:36:39,711 --> 00:36:41,440
Didn't you hear what he said?
- l just ignore it..

628
00:36:41,546 --> 00:36:43,673
..when a mad dog barks.
- But l am not like you.

629
00:36:43,782 --> 00:36:46,114
l would bury this scoundrel..
- What more can you do..

630
00:36:46,384 --> 00:36:48,648
..except ruining our reputation !

631
00:36:51,556 --> 00:36:52,614
Your father has always
been like that. - Yes.

632
00:36:52,724 --> 00:36:53,918
Don't mind him.
- l don't.

633
00:36:54,025 --> 00:36:56,516
You did a favor on this
village by thrashing this scoundrel.

634
00:36:56,628 --> 00:36:58,061
Don't praise me so much,
people might cast an evil eye.

635
00:36:58,129 --> 00:37:00,962
l will ward those eyes, but
first tell me will you marry me?

636
00:37:01,066 --> 00:37:03,534
Marry you? lf your boyfriend
knows about it he will kill me.

637
00:37:03,635 --> 00:37:05,466
Do one thing. Find the most
beautiful girl of this district..

638
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:06,969
..l will marry her.

639
00:37:07,872 --> 00:37:08,861
Why are you blushing?

00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:56,485
''Your face is a bit mischievous.''

654
00:37:56,588 --> 00:37:58,715
''That's why l liked you.''

655
00:37:58,823 --> 00:38:03,021
''That's why l liked
you a bit, a little bit.''

656
00:38:36,828 --> 00:38:41,231
''When l ask you to wear
a sari you wear a voni.''

657
00:38:41,533 --> 00:38:45,867
''When l ask you to wear a
voni you come in a nightie.''

658
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:48,097
''When l ask you to
come through the gate..''

659
00:38:48,173 --> 00:38:50,141
''..you jump over the wall.''

660
00:38:50,241 --> 00:38:52,903
''When l ask you to
jump over the wall..''

661
00:38:53,011 --> 00:38:54,842
''..you come through the window.''

662
00:38:54,946 --> 00:38:56,971
''l am in trouble
when you are beside me.''

663
00:38:57,082 --> 00:38:59,209
''l am in serious
trouble when you are free.''

664
00:38:59,317 --> 00:39:01,615
''l am in trouble at daytime.''

665
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,688
''l am in serious
trouble at nighttime.''

666
00:39:03,788 --> 00:39:08,020
''l have number of complaints,
not one, two or three.''

667
00:39:08,326 --> 00:39:10,226
''You are a bit mischievous.''

668
00:39:10,328 --> 00:39:12,262
''Your smile is a bit mischievous.''

669
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,555
''Your words are bit mischievous.''

670
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:17,100
''Your eyes are bit mischievous.''

671
00:39:17,202 --> 00:39:19,193
''That's why l liked you.''

672
00:39:19,304 --> 00:39:23,866
''That's why l liked you..
- A bit, a little bit.''

673
00:39:54,906 --> 00:39:59,206
''When l lay the cot for you,
you ask me for the bed.''

674
00:39:59,344 --> 00:40:03,804
''When l set the bed for you
to sleep, you overwhelm me.''

675
00:40:03,915 --> 00:40:08,147
''When l touch your cheek
you blush and move aside.''

676
00:40:08,253 --> 00:40:12,815
''When l step back you
give me some signals.''

677
00:40:12,957 --> 00:40:15,084
''When l say no l am at trouble.''

678
00:40:15,193 --> 00:40:17,354
''When l say yes l am
in serious trouble.''

679
00:40:17,595 --> 00:40:19,620
''When l pamper you l am in trouble.''

680
00:40:19,731 --> 00:40:21,699
''When l provoke you l
am in serious trouble.''

681
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,100
''l haven't hidden anything
here, there or anywhere.''

682
00:40:26,204 --> 00:40:27,967
''You are a bit mischievous.''

683
00:40:28,072 --> 00:40:30,233
''Your deeds are a bit mischievous.''

684
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:32,639
''Your stories are
a bit mischievous.''

685
00:40:32,744 --> 00:40:35,110
''Your intentions are
a bit mischievous.''

686
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:37,238
''That's why l liked you.''

687
00:40:37,348 --> 00:40:41,842
''That's why l liked
you a bit, a little bit.''

688
00:40:41,986 --> 00:40:43,681
''You are a bit mischievous.''

689
00:40:43,788 --> 00:40:45,949
''Your outspokenness
is a bit mischievous.''

690
00:40:46,057 --> 00:40:48,184
''Your taste is a bit mischievous.''

691
00:40:48,293 --> 00:40:50,853
''Your thoughts are
a bit mischievous.''

692
00:40:50,962 --> 00:40:53,021
''That's why l liked you.''

693
00:40:53,131 --> 00:40:57,192
''That's why l liked
you a bit, a little bit.''

694
00:41:06,611 --> 00:41:10,945
Hello, brother!
Purushottam's son thrashed me.

695
00:41:11,049 --> 00:41:12,107
l thought you would
insult them there..

696
00:41:12,217 --> 00:41:15,880
..and give a great news, but
you are giving me bad news?

697
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,953
The real bad news is here.
First of all stop digging here.

698
00:41:19,057 --> 00:41:21,855
Why? - Rama Krishna is
digging a hole for there.

699
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,093
Have you gone mad?
- You will get mad if you see them.

700
00:41:25,296 --> 00:41:26,285
Look there.

701
00:41:33,471 --> 00:41:36,201
He is selling flats for
-1,000 rupees per square feet.

702
00:41:36,307 --> 00:41:38,172
lf he sells for such a low
amount he'll face a great loss.

703
00:41:38,276 --> 00:41:42,007
Has Rama Krishna gone mad?
Why is he doing this?

704
00:41:42,113 --> 00:41:46,777
On the occasion of our
company's 25th anniversary..

705
00:41:46,885 --> 00:41:51,151
..we started this venture to
give you flats for low rates.

706
00:41:52,223 --> 00:41:54,384
Once upon a time we were
also a middle-class family.

707
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:59,321
My father also
wished to own a house.

708
00:42:00,164 --> 00:42:03,998
But by the time we reached
the position to own a flat..

709
00:42:04,102 --> 00:42:06,332
..he wasn't there around to see it.

710
00:42:06,471 --> 00:42:08,837
There are a number of
people who like my father..

711
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,033
..dream of owning a house.

712
00:42:11,142 --> 00:42:14,634
That's why without
expecting any profits if we build..

713
00:42:14,746 --> 00:42:18,011
..homes for you our
father's soul would rest in peace.

714
00:42:18,283 --> 00:42:20,114
We would finish this
venture as soon as possible.

715
00:42:20,218 --> 00:42:23,312
lf they finish this project they
would turn into gods for people.

716
00:42:23,454 --> 00:42:24,887
You mean he is a demon?

717
00:42:26,124 --> 00:42:29,685
l will turn their dream
project into death-project.

718
00:42:40,438 --> 00:42:42,702
Greetings, Mr.
Umapati. Please sit down.

719
00:42:42,941 --> 00:42:44,431
l would've come to you
had you given me a call.

720
00:42:44,709 --> 00:42:46,267
You have reached
another level right now.

721
00:42:47,211 --> 00:42:49,179
You are the one who
helped me reach this level.

722
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,145
l can step down any
number of stairs for you.

723
00:42:51,249 --> 00:42:53,945
l don't even if you would step
down stairs or kill people..

724
00:42:54,052 --> 00:42:56,850
..but cancel the approval
for Jana Nivas project..

725
00:42:56,955 --> 00:42:58,217
..that R. K. Builders have started.

726
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:03,749
Sir, l will approve your papers e
ven if there are discrepancies.

727
00:43:04,195 --> 00:43:07,028
But R. K. Builders'
papers have no loopholes.

728
00:43:07,198 --> 00:43:11,066
lf l cancel them now l
will lose my job. - Great.

729
00:43:11,235 --> 00:43:13,135
We need to send you
briefcases even if you..

730
00:43:13,237 --> 00:43:14,226
..don't ask for them, but
you won't do anything for us.

731
00:43:14,505 --> 00:43:17,804
We can't cancel something
once we have approved it.

732
00:43:17,909 --> 00:43:20,901
You can't? Hey, call the minister.

733
00:43:21,879 --> 00:43:23,813
Hello! Greetings, sir.
Minister is on line.

734
00:43:24,816 --> 00:43:28,513
l am Umapati speaking. R. K.
Builders are building Jana Nivas.

735
00:43:28,786 --> 00:43:30,981
You have to stop it. Tell me
where you are. l'll come there.

736
00:43:31,089 --> 00:43:34,115
Where will you come? l
am in Bangkok right now.

737
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:36,224
Meet me when l come back.

738
00:43:36,327 --> 00:43:40,354
There's no Jana Nivas
or anything. l am here.

739
00:43:40,798 --> 00:43:43,961
l will destroy it.
- Come here fast. Come fast.

740
00:43:47,972 --> 00:43:49,530
Clean it properly. The
car-owner should faint..

741
00:43:49,807 --> 00:43:52,002
..after he sees our work.
- Ok. - Clean it.

742
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:56,141
Nani, is the car-servicing done?
- Yes, sir, it's done.

743
00:43:56,247 --> 00:43:57,339
We will ward off the evil
eye and you can take it.

744
00:43:58,282 --> 00:44:00,182
You will ward off the evil
eye from the car? - Yes, sir.

745
00:44:00,284 --> 00:44:02,218
That's a sentiment.
- Very good.

746
00:44:02,453 --> 00:44:05,422
l like people with sentiments.

747
00:44:06,024 --> 00:44:08,151
l am also very sentimental
with this car. - Really, sir?

748
00:44:08,259 --> 00:44:12,787
Who do you think this car is?
lt's my son. - lt's your son?

749
00:44:13,197 --> 00:44:15,062
Then how are you traveling
sitting on your son, sir?

750
00:44:15,166 --> 00:44:18,135
Children should carry the
burden of aging parents, right?

751
00:44:18,236 --> 00:44:22,229
Very interesting, sir. You
story has a great sentiment, sir.

752
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,329
You know what happened once?

753
00:44:23,441 --> 00:44:24,601
How would l know it
unless you tell me, sir?

754
00:44:25,476 --> 00:44:28,843
A guy picked the wallet from
my son's pocket. - Come on, sir.

755
00:44:29,047 --> 00:44:30,947
Cars don't have pockets.
- l mean he stole..

756
00:44:31,049 --> 00:44:33,847
..petrol from the tank. l
took him to the blood bank..

757
00:44:33,951 --> 00:44:37,546
..and took out one
liter blood and sold it.

758
00:44:37,655 --> 00:44:39,885
Sold whom? The thief?
- No, l sold his blood.

759
00:44:40,058 --> 00:44:43,858
Blood for blood. lt's a superb
title, sir. Hey, bring the coconut.

760
00:44:44,262 --> 00:44:46,822
No, brother. He is
very attached to his car.

761
00:44:46,931 --> 00:44:48,193
Remember what
happened the last time.

762
00:44:48,299 --> 00:44:50,529
Hey, do not underestimate me.

763
00:44:51,035 --> 00:44:52,525
That's why l made a
special arrangement.

764
00:44:52,904 --> 00:44:54,303
Boys, cover the glass.

765
00:45:09,387 --> 00:45:11,651
Don't feel bad, sir. lt's
just a headlight that broke.

766
00:45:11,923 --> 00:45:15,154
That's not a
headlight; it's my son's eye.

767
00:45:15,259 --> 00:45:17,193
You made my son blind?

768
00:45:17,862 --> 00:45:19,625
O God! O God!

769
00:45:20,998 --> 00:45:25,662
lt was car's right headlight,
but he hit on my left eye.

770
00:45:25,937 --> 00:45:28,132
O God! l'll stay quiet, or
else he will hit me again. O God!

771
00:45:46,023 --> 00:45:47,388
Hey! Hey! Hey!

772
00:45:49,193 --> 00:45:51,354
What are you doing here?
- Uncle asked me to come here.

773
00:45:51,529 --> 00:45:56,557
Which uncle? - Your father is
my father's childhood friend.

774
00:45:57,034 --> 00:46:00,094
He asked me to leave
the hostel and stay here.

775
00:46:00,238 --> 00:46:01,227
But that doesn't mean
you would come here..

776
00:46:01,339 --> 00:46:02,670
..as if this is your house.

777
00:46:03,474 --> 00:46:04,463
What's this?

778
00:46:05,576 --> 00:46:10,411
You don't know? - l will make
you leave right now. Father.

779
00:46:10,515 --> 00:46:12,449
Yes, son.
- Who is that in my room?

780
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:14,381
She's a student who's
studying here. Change your language.

781
00:46:14,485 --> 00:46:16,248
First of all change her room.
- Not possible.

782
00:46:16,354 --> 00:46:17,582
Till her exams are over
she will be in that room.

783
00:46:17,655 --> 00:46:19,646
lf you are so fond of her
you can even write her exams.

784
00:46:19,924 --> 00:46:21,551
First of all tell me where
l would stay. - ln my room.

785
00:46:21,659 --> 00:46:23,684
Why? So that you could
lecture me even in sleep?

786
00:46:23,961 --> 00:46:25,189
l will lie down
somewhere around. But remember..

787
00:46:25,263 --> 00:46:27,993
..you made my room a
scapegoat for your reputation.

788
00:46:28,332 --> 00:46:29,993
You have become so tall,
but your brain hasn't grown.

789
00:46:30,101 --> 00:46:31,090
You aren't even tall?

790
00:46:32,036 --> 00:46:33,936
What did uncle say?
- What will he say!

791
00:46:34,038 --> 00:46:35,630
He said if l didn't
like this arrangement..

792
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:36,900
..l could throw you
from the terrace..

793
00:46:37,008 --> 00:46:38,942
..but since you are a girl l
said l will adjust somewhere.

794
00:46:39,043 --> 00:46:40,305
Really?
- Yes, you heard it right.

795
00:46:40,411 --> 00:46:42,470
Arrange my clothes and
shift to the room downstairs.

796
00:46:46,317 --> 00:46:48,410
Listen, there's a
small problem in this room.

797
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:52,211
Why? The AC doesn't work.
- You want an AC as well?

798
00:46:52,323 --> 00:46:54,291
lt's not that. lt comes
at 12 O' clock midnight.

799
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:57,458
What will come?
- Tilottama.

800
00:46:57,562 --> 00:47:00,122
A girl with that name used
to stay in front of our house.

801
00:47:00,231 --> 00:47:01,220
She tried to win me over.

802
00:47:01,632 --> 00:47:03,293
Why would she come here at midnight?

803
00:47:03,467 --> 00:47:04,957
That's the time
spirits wander around.

804
00:47:05,503 --> 00:47:07,164
Spirit?

805
00:47:07,972 --> 00:47:09,735
Yes, it's a spirit.

806
00:47:10,007 --> 00:47:10,996
lt's been a year since she died.

807
00:47:11,108 --> 00:47:13,269
As l didn't give her a green
signal she turned into a devil.

808
00:47:16,047 --> 00:47:19,039
Midnight at 12 O' clock! Be careful!

809
00:47:35,533 --> 00:47:36,591
O God!

810
00:47:37,301 --> 00:47:38,529
O God! O God!

811
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:42,105
lf l got so scared then that girl..

812
00:47:43,407 --> 00:47:45,272
She would vacate
the room in a second.

813
00:48:04,028 --> 00:48:09,022
Who are you?
- lt's me, Tilottama.

814
00:48:09,267 --> 00:48:11,667
Tilottama? l was
just kidding with her..

815
00:48:11,769 --> 00:48:15,705
..but you came here in real?
- To take revenge.

816
00:48:16,173 --> 00:48:21,611
ln previous birth you
betrayed me in love. - Me?

817
00:48:22,346 --> 00:48:24,576
l just flirt with girls once
in a while.. That's all l do.

818
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:28,182
Ok, then, now you love.
- You?

819
00:48:28,286 --> 00:48:31,084
No, love Bhanu who
came to your house.

820
00:48:31,188 --> 00:48:33,053
She is even more dangerous than you.

821
00:48:33,157 --> 00:48:36,649
Hey, if you say one more
word about that girl..

822
00:48:36,761 --> 00:48:41,164
..l will bite your
throat. Love Bhanu.

823
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,291
How can you ask me to
love someone at gunpoint!

824
00:48:44,402 --> 00:48:45,426
First l need to get that feeling.

825
00:48:46,337 --> 00:48:47,565
l will think about it and tell you.

826
00:48:47,672 --> 00:48:51,199
l will come here again.
You must say yes.

827
00:48:51,509 --> 00:48:54,137
You may go now. Go.

828
00:49:01,552 --> 00:49:02,712
What a rubbish idea!

829
00:49:04,322 --> 00:49:08,053
Chanti, there's a wedding mall
in Panjagutta, right? - Yes.

830
00:49:08,225 --> 00:49:10,386
Where is it, son? - A flyover
collapsed few days ago, right?

831
00:49:10,494 --> 00:49:11,688
lt's in front of it.
- You know where exactly it is?

832
00:49:11,796 --> 00:49:13,855
Yes.
- Then take us there this evening.

833
00:49:14,131 --> 00:49:17,396
O aunt, you put me in trouble.
- lt's Shailu's engagement.

834
00:49:17,501 --> 00:49:18,490
We need to buy ornaments.

835
00:49:18,602 --> 00:49:20,126
The groom's family
members are also coming.

836
00:49:21,238 --> 00:49:24,071
Really! Ok, then, l
will take you there, aunt.

837
00:49:24,241 --> 00:49:25,469
Take one more idli.
- No, thanks, aunt.

838
00:49:25,576 --> 00:49:28,568
l have got some urgent work.
- What's so urgent?

839
00:49:29,513 --> 00:49:31,640
My plans came to standstill now.
- But what did you plan?

840
00:49:31,749 --> 00:49:32,738
l never saw you doing anything.

841
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:34,317
You need not praise me so
much so early in the morning.

842
00:49:34,418 --> 00:49:36,852
Tell me what the matter is.
- Drop Bhanu at her college.

843
00:49:36,954 --> 00:49:38,251
You will be doing
something for a change.

844
00:49:38,689 --> 00:49:41,317
Shall l not bring her back?
- Do l have to mention it?

845
00:49:41,425 --> 00:49:44,155
Shall l also buy her
balloons and ice-creams on the way?

846
00:49:44,328 --> 00:49:46,592
l am not going to drop her
anywhere. Ask her to go alone.

847
00:49:46,864 --> 00:49:47,888
Remove your hand.

848
00:49:48,766 --> 00:49:50,700
Your occupied my room
and made me a watchman.

849
00:49:50,801 --> 00:49:52,530
Now you want to get on my
bike and make me your driver.

850
00:49:52,636 --> 00:49:54,570
l will stab you. Get lost. Oh !

851
00:49:55,573 --> 00:49:58,542
Girl, you didn't go to college yet?
- l am going, uncle.

852
00:49:58,642 --> 00:50:01,543
How will you go? Chanti.
- Yes, uncle.

853
00:50:01,645 --> 00:50:03,169
Drop her at her college.
- l was just thinking of it..

854
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,612
..and you said it.

855
00:50:06,917 --> 00:50:07,906
Give him money for petrol.

856
00:50:08,152 --> 00:50:09,312
l will him the money
a long ago, brother.

857
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,887
lt's been a year since
you gave me 100 rupees.

858
00:50:11,622 --> 00:50:13,817
Madam, come on, let's go.
- Bye, uncle.

859
00:50:16,727 --> 00:50:18,456
lf it's not to put me
in trouble tell me..

860
00:50:18,562 --> 00:50:20,393
..what would you
achieve by studying so much?

861
00:50:20,498 --> 00:50:22,659
l'll give you injections. l
will study hard and be a doctor.

862
00:50:22,767 --> 00:50:25,634
So you are trying to get a
license to commit murders.

863
00:50:26,871 --> 00:50:29,169
Did Tilotamma come last night?

864
00:50:30,574 --> 00:50:31,666
Do we really have to
talk about it now?

865
00:50:31,942 --> 00:50:34,206
You're the one who said
that she comes every night.

866
00:50:34,311 --> 00:50:35,369
So l was wondering if she
came last night as well.

867
00:50:35,446 --> 00:50:37,277
Yes, she came and we
talked for a while.

868
00:50:37,381 --> 00:50:39,406
And when l said that l
am pretty tired she left.

869
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:40,839
Didn't she say anything else?

870
00:50:41,619 --> 00:50:43,553
Yes, she said she is
getting bored these days.

871
00:50:43,654 --> 00:50:45,212
Will you go to her?

872
00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:48,649
l am serious. Both of
you are lovers, right?

873
00:50:48,759 --> 00:50:50,420
l wanted to know if she
talked about love and all.

874
00:50:50,528 --> 00:50:52,519
Yes, she got some idiot. Hey!

875
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:55,963
Hey! lt seems both of you
are maintaining great distance.

876
00:50:56,233 --> 00:50:57,791
Where did you get her? On
the street or in the bar?

877
00:50:57,868 --> 00:50:59,802
Hey, if you talk too much
l will break your bones.

878
00:50:59,904 --> 00:51:01,235
O God! Did you already get
drunk so early in the morning..

879
00:51:01,338 --> 00:51:02,430
..that you are
getting so aggressive?

880
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:03,973
Hey, you go to the
shed. l will come.

881
00:51:04,241 --> 00:51:05,503
You be careful. lf she
doesn't have anything to munch..

882
00:51:05,609 --> 00:51:06,598
..when she drinks she will
eat you. Come soon. - Ok. Ok.

883
00:51:07,344 --> 00:51:08,811
Why do you befriend such idiots?

884
00:51:08,913 --> 00:51:11,381
lt makes me feel
superior relatively.

885
00:51:13,884 --> 00:51:16,717
Take out everything there in
the shop. They will buy one.

886
00:51:16,787 --> 00:51:18,778
You stay quiet. See this one, dear.

887
00:51:24,361 --> 00:51:25,350
l didn't like it, mom.

888
00:51:25,463 --> 00:51:27,454
Check this one. How is this one?

889
00:51:34,772 --> 00:51:36,034
l didn't like this one
as well, sister-in-law.

890
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,432
Then what else do you want?

891
00:51:37,975 --> 00:51:40,375
Your daughter-in-law
doesn't like our selection.

892
00:51:40,478 --> 00:51:41,945
You select one for her.
- Brother-in-law knows well..

893
00:51:42,046 --> 00:51:43,638
..what she wants.
- l?

894
00:51:43,747 --> 00:51:45,715
How would l know about
these ladies' things! - Really?

895
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:47,750
lf you knew nothing
you wouldn't have..

896
00:51:47,818 --> 00:51:49,911
..signaled her from behind like a
traffic police. - Actually it's..

897
00:51:51,322 --> 00:51:52,550
What, brother-in-law!
You are already making..

898
00:51:52,656 --> 00:51:53,850
..my sister dance to your tunes.

899
00:51:55,392 --> 00:51:56,654
Enough of laughing. Do it fast.

900
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,819
Sister-in-law, you go
and see that diamond ring.

901
00:51:58,929 --> 00:52:00,294
We will come there as soon
as we are done here. - Ok.

902
00:52:00,397 --> 00:52:01,386
Come on ! Come on ! Get going.

903
00:52:03,801 --> 00:52:04,790
l'm sorry.

904
00:52:06,937 --> 00:52:08,905
Madam.
- Show me latest diamond rings.

905
00:52:09,006 --> 00:52:10,303
One minute. l'll bring them, madam.

906
00:52:14,345 --> 00:52:16,870
Did you like it?
- l haven't seen them yet.

907
00:52:16,981 --> 00:52:18,812
Not the ring, but the touch.

908
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:22,279
He clashed with you.
Did you like it?

909
00:52:22,887 --> 00:52:25,378
Don't change the expression.
Stay normal.

910
00:52:26,023 --> 00:52:27,786
l don't even know who he is.

911
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:30,923
lf you didn't know who he
is you should've held him..

912
00:52:30,995 --> 00:52:33,020
..by his collar and
slapped him. Did you like him?

913
00:52:33,631 --> 00:52:36,691
lt was just by accident..
- Not by accident..

914
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,667
..but you must've
bumped into him on habit.

915
00:52:41,472 --> 00:52:42,837
Why do you talk like that?

916
00:52:46,477 --> 00:52:48,308
You are abusing me in your mind..

917
00:52:48,412 --> 00:52:50,880
..that it would've been
great if l hadn't seen it, right?

918
00:52:53,651 --> 00:52:55,881
What's this! - You didn't
say anything when he did that..

919
00:52:55,986 --> 00:52:59,319
..but you feel bad
when l talk about it?

920
00:53:00,824 --> 00:53:04,783
Our family's here. Wipe
your crocodile tears and come.

921
00:53:10,901 --> 00:53:13,131
Bubble gums. Bubble gums.
How many bubble gums..

922
00:53:13,404 --> 00:53:15,634
..do you want? Uncle.
- What?

923
00:53:15,739 --> 00:53:17,866
Will you tell us a nice story?
- Story.

924
00:53:18,008 --> 00:53:19,407
l will tell you a
great story. l am coming.

925
00:53:19,843 --> 00:53:21,470
What sort of a story
do you want to hear?

926
00:53:21,579 --> 00:53:23,809
Tell us a new story, uncle.
- A new story?

927
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:27,711
Once upon a time there was a king.

928
00:53:27,818 --> 00:53:31,481
That king had seven sons.
One day they go to hunting..

929
00:53:31,589 --> 00:53:34,387
And bring seven fishes, right?
- How did you guess that?

930
00:53:34,491 --> 00:53:36,322
ls that a story? Now we understood..

931
00:53:36,427 --> 00:53:39,055
..why grandpa always scolds you.
- We thought there is..

932
00:53:39,163 --> 00:53:40,994
..generation gap only
between you and grandpa..

933
00:53:41,098 --> 00:53:43,464
..but there is generation
gap between you and us as well.

934
00:53:44,902 --> 00:53:48,998
l will tell you the story. Hear it.
-Tell me. - lt's a dark night.

935
00:53:50,574 --> 00:53:53,008
Complete darkness.

936
00:53:53,877 --> 00:53:56,812
Nothing is visible.
- You can switch on the light.

937
00:53:57,147 --> 00:53:59,980
They switched it on. Boom!

938
00:54:00,451 --> 00:54:01,577
The light exploded.

939
00:54:02,386 --> 00:54:06,516
ln that darkness a ghost
comes in a white sari.

940
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:10,820
lt came closer.

941
00:54:11,161 --> 00:54:12,753
lt came even closer.

942
00:54:13,063 --> 00:54:15,896
The head turned.
- Whose? - The ghost's.

943
00:54:16,533 --> 00:54:17,761
l am shaking just on
the opening sequence.

944
00:54:18,002 --> 00:54:19,697
l wonder what would happen to
me if l hear the entire story.

945
00:54:20,504 --> 00:54:23,769
Hey, you continue it..
And that ghost..

946
00:54:27,578 --> 00:54:28,567
Hail lord Anjineya!
Hail lord Anjineya!

947
00:54:28,646 --> 00:54:30,511
Hail lord Anjineya! Hail lord
Anjineya! Hail lord Anjineya!

948

have so many weapons..

949
00:54:38,789 --> 00:54:42,850
..even if Tilotamma's grandma
comes here she can't harm me.

950
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:44,549
O God!

951
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:48,627
Hey, switch off the lights.

952
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,539
Chanti.
- Who?

953
00:54:59,843 --> 00:55:02,744
lt's me Tillu.
- Tillu?

954
00:55:07,151 --> 00:55:10,882
Uncle. Aunt. Father. Ghost. Ghost.

955
00:55:12,589 --> 00:55:13,578
Ghost.

956
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:20,218
What? What happened?
- There's a ghost, uncle.

957
00:55:20,497 --> 00:55:23,625
There's a ghost over here.
- You still believe in ghosts?

958
00:55:23,734 --> 00:55:26,999
You must've had a nightmare.
- He himself is a nightmare.

959
00:55:32,276 --> 00:55:35,575
O my ATM!
- Have some water and sleep.

960
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:39,012
Uncle, l am fine now. You go and sl
eep. l will also sleep.

Tilottama.
- What?

962
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,551
Today l met the
priest in the temple.

963
00:55:51,695 --> 00:55:55,529
Those who die unmarried and
without losing virginity..

964
00:55:55,632 --> 00:55:58,829
..they turn into white sari-wearing
ghosts and lose control.

965
00:55:59,103 --> 00:56:01,003
That's why..
- That's why..

966
00:56:01,105 --> 00:56:05,701
lf you lose your virginity
now you would reach heaven.

967
00:56:05,809 --> 00:56:07,709
l made up my mind.
Come on, let's do it.

Tillu. Tillu, listen to
me. Stop there, Tillu.

Where will you go now?

Who do you think
Chanti is? One-eyed demon !

973
00:56:18,155 --> 00:56:21,181
And you dared to scare this Chanti?

974
00:56:21,792 --> 00:56:23,726
..love you.
- What?

975
00:56:23,827 --> 00:56:28,264

00:57:04,868 --> 00:57:08,133
''Will you give me a kiss as rent?''

981
00:57:08,605 --> 00:57:12,200
''lf there's a home in
the heart. lf it's vacant.''

982
00:57:12,309 --> 00:57:15,870
''l definitely stay there.''

983
00:57:15,979 --> 00:57:19,073
''l will give you myself in rent.''

984
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:23,177
''Can you shift into it right away?''

985
00:57:23,287 --> 00:57:26,814
''Will you open its doors?''

986
00:57:26,924 --> 00:57:30,690
''Will you sign an agreement to
stay in it for hundred years?''

987
00:57:30,794 --> 00:57:34,195
''There's a home in the heart.
lt's still vacant.''

988
00:57:34,331 --> 00:57:37,926
''Would you like to stay there?''

989
00:57:38,035 --> 00:57:41,163
''Will you give me a kiss as rent?''

990
00:58:10,901 --> 00:58:12,630
''You are a beautiful devil.''

991
00:58:12,836 --> 00:58:14,326
''l am scared of you.''

992
00:58:14,771 --> 00:58:18,263
''l fought with you. lt's the
beginning of our love-story.''

993
00:58:18,375 --> 00:58:20,036
''You detected my problem.''

994
00:58:20,143 --> 00:58:21,804
''You treated it with a smile.''

995
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,015
''l lost my aggression. Now
our love would blossom.''

996
00:58:26,116 --> 00:58:29,677
''You came to me as a
surprise and presented me bliss.''

997
00:58:29,786 --> 00:58:33,153
''You came to me as a boon
and made me intoxicated.''

998
00:58:33,257 --> 00:58:36,920
''You entered my life and
made me fall in love.''

999
00:58:37,027 --> 00:58:40,690
''There's a home in the heart.
lt's still vacant.''

1000
00:58:40,764 --> 00:58:44,291
''Would you like to stay there?''

1001
00:58:44,401 --> 00:58:47,768
''Will you give me a kiss as rent?''

1002
00:59:21,071 --> 00:59:22,766
''You were a burden
to me all these days.''

1003
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:24,498
''You burnt me all the times.''

1004
00:59:24,775 --> 00:59:28,302
''Today you garlanded me.
Now you are my destination.''

1005
00:59:28,412 --> 00:59:29,970
''l used to curse
you all these days.''

1006
00:59:30,147 --> 00:59:31,944
''l abused you all the times.''

1007
00:59:32,049 --> 00:59:36,076
''l understood my fault.
Now you are my world.''

1008
00:59:36,186 --> 00:59:39,815
''You are the
bright spot of my life.''

1009
00:59:39,923 --> 00:59:43,154
''You make me swing in joy.''

1010
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:47,128
''First you tormented me and
then turned into my life.''

1011
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:50,757
''There's a home in the heart.
lt's still vacant.''

1012
00:59:50,867 --> 00:59:54,303

''Can you shift into it right away?''

1015
01:00:01,945 --> 01:00:05,244
''Will you open its doors?''

1016
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:09,046
''Will you sign an agreement to
stay in it for hundred years?''

1017
01:00:09,319 --> 01:00:10,946
''There's a home in the heart.
lt's still vacant.''

1018
01:00:11,054 --> 01:00:12,885
''lf there's a home in
the heart. lf it's vacant.''

1019
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:16,790
''Would you like to stay there?''

1020
01:00:16,893 --> 01:00:19,862
''l will give you myself in rent.''

1021
01:00:34,177 --> 01:00:35,166
Hello!

1022
01:01:16,019 --> 01:01:17,008
What's this, sister-in-law!

1023
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:19,051
Everyone is eagerly
awaiting the engagement tomorrow..

1024
01:01:19,156 --> 01:01:20,987
..and here you are..
- l don't want this family..

1025
01:01:21,091 --> 01:01:23,025
..to lose its
reputation because of me.

1026
01:01:23,193 --> 01:01:25,093
But what happened that we'd
lose reputation, sister-in-law?

1027
01:01:26,897 --> 01:01:29,525
When we went to
shopping for the engagement..

1028
01:01:29,633 --> 01:01:31,533
..l went to the trial
room to change the dress..

1029
01:01:32,869 --> 01:01:34,359
..and someone shot me
there with secret camera..

1030
01:01:34,471 --> 01:01:37,031
..and is blackmailing me?

1031
01:01:37,874 --> 01:01:41,139
He calls me everyday and abuses me.

1032
01:01:41,578 --> 01:01:44,012
He says if l don't go to the
place he asks me to come..

1033
01:01:44,114 --> 01:01:46,912
..he would release it on internet..

1034
01:01:47,017 --> 01:01:49,144
..or send a copy to your brother.

1035
01:01:49,252 --> 01:01:51,584
And for that you want to die?
What's your fault in this?

1036
01:01:51,855 --> 01:01:52,844
You could tell
brother about it, right?

1037
01:01:54,024 --> 01:01:55,514
You don't know your brother well.

1038
01:01:56,193 --> 01:01:57,387
ln the beginning of our marriage..

1039
01:01:57,494 --> 01:02:00,292
..he said there shouldn't
be any secrets between us..

1040
01:02:00,397 --> 01:02:02,422
..l told him about a guy
who liked me in college.

1041
01:02:03,233 --> 01:02:06,464
From that day onwards
he tortures me everyday.

1042
01:02:08,638 --> 01:02:09,969
And now if he learns about this..

1043
01:02:10,073 --> 01:02:12,507
..he would think that
l did it intentionally.

1044
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:16,679
lnstead of telling him about it,
it's far better to commit suicide.

1045
01:02:16,947 --> 01:02:18,505
What's this, sister-in-law!
You want your children as well..

1046
01:02:18,615 --> 01:02:19,912
..to become motherless like me?

1047
01:02:21,351 --> 01:02:23,979
Never ever do such a thing
again. Forget everything.

1048
01:02:24,354 --> 01:02:25,343
l will take care of him.

1049
01:02:32,162 --> 01:02:34,096
Hey, where is your boss?
- He's there upstairs.

1050
01:02:34,197 --> 01:02:35,186
Who are you, sir?

1051
01:02:38,435 --> 01:02:41,871
You shoot women with
secret cameras, scoundrel!

1052
01:02:44,407 --> 01:02:46,432
You blackmail family
ladies in such a way..

1053
01:02:46,543 --> 01:02:48,477
..that she could not
tell anyone! Rascal!

1054
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:08,521
Hey! Tell me where that reel is.

1055
01:03:08,632 --> 01:03:10,156
Give me that reel or l
will break your legs.

1056
01:03:10,333 --> 01:03:11,425
Where is it?
- l'll tell you. l'll tell you.

1057
01:03:11,535 --> 01:03:13,935
Take it out. Take it out.
- l'll take it out.

1058
01:03:14,037 --> 01:03:16,164
Take it out.
- l will. l will.

1059
01:03:17,107 --> 01:03:19,735
Here.. Here is
your CD. Take your CD.

1060
01:03:22,012 --> 01:03:23,206
You record such things?

1061
01:03:23,613 --> 01:03:24,944
l am not filing a
police case against you..

1062
01:03:25,048 --> 01:03:26,948
..as it would ruin our reputation.

1063
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:30,677
lf you do such a thing again
l will kill you, scoundrel.

1064
01:03:59,015 --> 01:04:00,539
Who did this to my son?

1065
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,479
Greetings.
Greetings. Please come in.

1066
01:04:03,019 --> 01:04:04,247
Sir, did you tell the
groom's family to leave the house..

1067
01:04:04,354 --> 01:04:06,254
..exactly at the time l told you?

1068
01:04:06,356 --> 01:04:08,187
Our Chanti went there to bring them.

1069
01:04:08,291 --> 01:04:10,122
Greetings, uncle.
- You are Purushottam's son, right?

1070
01:04:10,227 --> 01:04:13,253
lt's his good fortune, uncle.
- What do you do?

1071
01:04:13,363 --> 01:04:15,695
Not one thing, uncle. But
office work, house-work, site-work..

1072
01:04:15,799 --> 01:04:18,597
..without a pause l
want to do everything..

1073
01:04:18,702 --> 01:04:20,533
..but since my family
don't leave them for me..

1074
01:04:20,637 --> 01:04:22,764
..l just supervise them. - So
you're a good-for-nothing fellow.

1075
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,735
Uncle has got a great sense of
humor. Get in. Get in. Get in.

1076
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:29,570
lt's my engagement.
- My time will also come.

1077
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:32,045
Why? Your family didn't
give you the green signal yet?

1078
01:04:32,349 --> 01:04:34,078
lf they had given me the
signal l wouldn't have taken..

1079
01:04:34,184 --> 01:04:36,311
..this loop line, the vehicle
would've already been running.

1080
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,545
Sir, the formalities are done.

1081
01:04:39,656 --> 01:04:41,351
You can exchange the betel
leaves if the groom's family comes.

1082
01:04:45,328 --> 01:04:46,317
The groom's family is here.

1083
01:04:46,429 --> 01:04:47,453
Go and bring auspicious water.

1084
01:04:54,237 --> 01:04:55,226
Why are they coming here?

1085
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:00,505
Stop there. Stop there.
Please. l am talking to you.

1086
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:01,577
Stop there. Stop there.

1087
01:05:02,612 --> 01:05:04,807
Find out that Chanti.

1088
01:05:08,318 --> 01:05:10,309
Brother, he's there.
- Please come. Please come.

1089
01:05:12,055 --> 01:05:13,215
Come here. Come here, scoundrel.

1090
01:05:16,393 --> 01:05:18,657
What do you think you are
doing? Get lost from here.

1091
01:05:19,062 --> 01:05:20,154
You want me to get lost?

1092
01:07:03,233 --> 01:07:04,564
Uncle. Uncle. Uncle.
- What?

1093
01:07:04,667 --> 01:07:05,691
He raised his hand on my uncle..
- Enough.

1094
01:07:05,769 --> 01:07:07,600
You gave us a great reception.
- Please tell him..

1095
01:07:07,704 --> 01:07:09,638
Father, at least hear him out.
- You're mad or what! Come.

1096
01:07:09,739 --> 01:07:11,468
He's saying something..
- Shut your mouth and come..

1097
01:07:31,828 --> 01:07:33,386
Get out of here. Get out.

1098
01:07:39,302 --> 01:07:40,326
All these days your fights
were confined to streets..

1099
01:07:40,437 --> 01:07:42,564
..but now you
brought them home. Get out.

1100
01:07:42,672 --> 01:07:44,401
He made a mistake.
That's why l thrashed him.

1101
01:07:44,507 --> 01:07:45,496
What has he done wrong?

1102
01:07:48,011 --> 01:07:50,241
You said you thrashed him
because he made a mistake.

1103
01:07:50,613 --> 01:07:51,807
What has he done wrong?

1104
01:07:58,421 --> 01:07:59,479
What will he say, brother! l'm
the one who made a mistake..

1105
01:07:59,589 --> 01:08:00,851
..by fathering him.

1106
01:08:02,525 --> 01:08:04,755
Father.
- No. Don't call me that.

1107
01:08:04,961 --> 01:08:07,225
The moment some goon
dared to touch my brother..

1108
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:09,855
..this family lost its
reputation. Get out!

1109
01:08:09,999 --> 01:08:12,934
Purushottam. - No,
brother. Don't support him today.

1110
01:08:13,036 --> 01:08:14,697
l can't tolerate the
disrepute he brought to us today.

1111
01:08:14,904 --> 01:08:16,565
l beg you. Don't stop me.

1112
01:08:16,673 --> 01:08:19,301
Hey, get lost! Why are you
still standing there? Get lost.

1113
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:24,473
What? First you broke
your sister's match..

1114
01:08:24,581 --> 01:08:26,014
..and now you are standing
here like a shameless fellow?

1115
01:08:26,282 --> 01:08:27,271
Get out of here.

1116
01:08:31,287 --> 01:08:33,016
Hey, if you really want to do
something good for this family..

1117
01:08:33,289 --> 01:08:35,553
..get lost from here.
Get lost from here.

1118
01:08:37,927 --> 01:08:38,985
All these days you
didn't have a mother.

1119
01:08:39,329 --> 01:08:41,422
Now you don't have a father
as well. Get lost. Get lost.

1120
01:08:41,598 --> 01:08:42,587
Get lost.

1121
01:09:18,501 --> 01:09:19,468
Stop there. Stop there.

1122
01:09:24,674 --> 01:09:25,663
Take it.

1123
01:09:26,709 --> 01:09:30,076
Get lost. Get lost. What a
useless car! We can't repair it.

1124
01:09:30,346 --> 01:09:31,711
Hello, Nani!
- Greetings, sir.

1125
01:09:31,814 --> 01:09:33,042
ls my car ready?
- lt's ready, sir.

1126
01:09:33,149 --> 01:09:34,582
Sir, listen to me and sell it
for 10,000 rupees and add another..

1127
01:09:34,684 --> 01:09:37,312
..90,000 to it and buy a
new car for one lakh, sir.

1128
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:38,444
But l need to get rid
of the old one, right?

1129
01:09:38,555 --> 01:09:39,544
ls it some sort of sentiment, sir?

1130
01:09:39,656 --> 01:09:40,645
No, it's an attachment.

1131
01:09:41,124 --> 01:09:44,093
l see. - l got this car in
dowry when l married my wife.

1132
01:09:44,794 --> 01:09:48,355
ln the beginning l used her lot,
later l got bored and left her.

1133
01:09:48,698 --> 01:09:50,689
You mean your wife?
- No, the car.

1134
01:09:51,367 --> 01:09:53,460
Then one day she created
a big scene. - The car?

1135
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:57,028
No, my wife. That l neglected her.
- Your wife?

1136
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:58,437
No, the car.

1137
01:09:59,609 --> 01:10:02,476
Then l looked after her
for a while. - The car.

1138
01:10:02,579 --> 01:10:05,377
No, my wife. Then l got
fed up of her and left her..

1139
01:10:05,481 --> 01:10:07,381
..on the outskirts of the town.
- Sir, what have you done!

1140
01:10:07,617 --> 01:10:08,914
You left your wife on
the outskirts of the town?

1141
01:10:09,152 --> 01:10:12,315
What's wrong with you ! l
left the car. - The car.

1142
01:10:12,488 --> 01:10:15,753
Then police found my
address and bring her back home.

1143
01:10:15,925 --> 01:10:18,416
Sir, l will guess
it right this time.

1144
01:10:18,528 --> 01:10:20,792
lt's the car that the police brought
back, right? - Correct. - Yes.

1145
01:10:21,431 --> 01:10:22,591
l am unable to get rid
of my wife and this car..

1146
01:10:22,699 --> 01:10:24,826
..but l am getting rid
of hard-earned money.

1147
01:10:24,934 --> 01:10:26,959
lt's difficult, sir.
Everyone has their sentiments.

1148
01:10:27,036 --> 01:10:28,503
Pappu, bring that coconut.

1149
01:10:28,605 --> 01:10:30,800
Brother, this sentiment
won't work out for us.

1150
01:10:31,007 --> 01:10:32,702
Leave it, brother.
- Shut up!

1151
01:10:33,176 --> 01:10:35,007
Just because Sachin
was getting out in 90s..

1152
01:10:35,111 --> 01:10:37,375
..he didn't stop hitting centuries.

1153
01:10:37,547 --> 01:10:39,538
Mine is also the same policy.
Just keep on watching.

1154
01:10:42,085 --> 01:10:45,077
Boys, come on ! Cover the entire car.

1155
01:10:46,389 --> 01:10:47,378
Yes.

1156
01:10:55,865 --> 01:10:57,799
O God!

1157
01:10:58,901 --> 01:11:01,529
Did you hear the sound
that the coconut made?

1158
01:11:01,638 --> 01:11:04,869
lt's not the coconut that broke..

1159
01:11:17,487 --> 01:11:20,012
Hey, forget whatever happened.

1160
01:11:20,957 --> 01:11:21,946
lt's easier said than done.

1161
01:11:23,059 --> 01:11:24,720
Did your father ever
kick you out of the house?

1162
01:11:25,795 --> 01:11:27,763
l too used to hate when
someone got emotional.

1163
01:11:29,532 --> 01:11:31,727
Only when you are
away from your family..

1164
01:11:31,834 --> 01:11:33,734
..you understand how hard it
is and the value of family.

1165
01:11:37,573 --> 01:11:38,562
Sister-in-law and Bhanu are coming.

1166
01:11:43,179 --> 01:11:44,168
Come, sister-in-law.

1167
01:11:44,647 --> 01:11:47,480
You are hanging out with
this ghost? She will scare you.

1168
01:11:47,583 --> 01:11:49,813
You are facing this
only because of me.

1169
01:11:50,586 --> 01:11:52,816
lt's not new for me. The
only thing is that father..

1170
01:11:52,922 --> 01:11:54,856
..increased the intensity and
asked me to leave. That's all.

1171
01:11:54,957 --> 01:11:56,686
You take everything lightly.

1172
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:00,027
And why should you stay
outside and suffer for me?

1173
01:12:00,797 --> 01:12:02,890
l will tell everyone the truth.

1174
01:12:02,999 --> 01:12:05,126
Sister-in-law, you know what
will happen if you tell the truth.

1175
01:12:05,268 --> 01:12:06,257
You tried to commit suicide..

1176
01:12:06,536 --> 01:12:07,525
..when brother doubted
you and said a few things.

1177
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:09,101
lf uncle knows about it he'd
kick brother out of the house..

1178
01:12:09,205 --> 01:12:11,105
..and the entice city
would know about it.

1179
01:12:11,674 --> 01:12:14,006
Then not yours, but
uncle's reputation will be gone.

1180
01:12:15,244 --> 01:12:17,906
lnstead of you separating from
brother it's better if l stay here.

1181
01:12:18,181 --> 01:12:21,207
Even my own brother wouldn't
have done this much for me.

1182
01:12:22,018 --> 01:12:25,146
l don't know how to thank you.
- What's this, sister-in-law!

1183
01:12:25,254 --> 01:12:26,778
You would make me an
outside by thanking me?

1184
01:12:26,889 --> 01:12:29,255
Do you know something? My
father can stay without me..

1185
01:12:29,492 --> 01:12:32,188
..but uncle can't. He would call
me in a day or two. l'll be back.

1186
01:12:32,295 --> 01:12:34,195
Tilottama, take my
sister-in-law back home.

1187
01:12:34,697 --> 01:12:37,131
You carry on, sister-in-law. l
will be back. You carry on. Go.

1188
01:12:56,986 --> 01:12:58,078
Brother, if you check
these documents once..

1189
01:12:58,187 --> 01:13:00,883
..l will send them for approval.

1190
01:13:01,023 --> 01:13:02,115
l will check them afterwards.

1191
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,894
First you go and bring Chanti home.

1192
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:09,830
Why should he stay outside as
if he doesn't have a family!

1193
01:13:10,032 --> 01:13:12,262
He will work hard. Let
him work hard, brother.

1194
01:13:12,869 --> 01:13:14,700
Only then will he know what life is.

1195
01:13:14,804 --> 01:13:17,932
Our home lost its
luster since he's gone.

1196
01:13:18,174 --> 01:13:20,005
lf he is here this home would
lose its reputation, sister-in-law.

1197
01:13:20,843 --> 01:13:23,869
Brother, l never
went against your word.

1198
01:13:25,014 --> 01:13:26,675
Please let me take a
decision this one time.

1199
01:13:33,623 --> 01:13:35,523
Nani, you are really great.

1200
01:13:35,725 --> 01:13:38,717
Even Bill Gates can't beat
you in helping others. - Why?

1201
01:13:38,828 --> 01:13:40,853
Bill Gates? Where is his shed?
- l will slap you.

1202
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:43,089
He is not a mechanic.
He is a billionaire.

1203
01:13:43,232 --> 01:13:44,631
A few days ago he
donated half his wealth..

1204
01:13:44,734 --> 01:13:45,860
..and the news was
written in every paper.

1205
01:13:46,202 --> 01:13:49,000
Brother, you too give me this
shed and get written about..

1206
01:13:49,105 --> 01:13:51,903
..in papers.
- lf he gives you his shed..

1207
01:13:52,008 --> 01:13:53,839
..he won't be written about in
papers, but he will definitely..

1208
01:13:53,943 --> 01:13:55,843
..become a pauper and die
on streets. Right, Nani?

1209
01:13:56,012 --> 01:13:58,207
Keep talking. Both of you carry on.

1210
01:13:58,714 --> 01:14:00,705
Why are you dragging me into
it now? Get lost, scoundrel!

1211
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:02,239
Stop here.

1212
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,550
O God! She's coming here?
- Take it.

1213
01:14:06,656 --> 01:14:08,715
Why? lt's not proper to
drink in front of a lady?

1214
01:14:08,925 --> 01:14:10,153
lf she sees this there would
be nothing for us to drink.

1215
01:14:10,259 --> 01:14:12,022
She will also drink it?
- Once she drank..

1216
01:14:12,128 --> 01:14:13,652
..one quarter-bottle gin
like pure water. - O God!

1217
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:16,697
Then let's hide it in the bottle.
- Last time we hid it in the bottle.

1218
01:14:16,799 --> 01:14:17,891
Let's hide these glasses. Come.

1219
01:14:20,937 --> 01:14:23,872
Hi!
- Hi! - What are you doing?

1220
01:14:23,973 --> 01:14:26,237
l swear on him we are not
drinking, just some snacks.

1221
01:14:26,742 --> 01:14:28,403
Where is Chanti?
- He went out.

1222
01:14:28,678 --> 01:14:30,009
Wherever he must be
gone he would come here.

1223
01:14:30,279 --> 01:14:31,268
l will wait for him.

1224
01:14:32,281 --> 01:14:35,273
Why did she settle here?
- She would give us a hard time.

1225
01:14:35,852 --> 01:14:38,047
Let's go to somewhere else.
He would get bored and leave.

1226
01:14:38,154 --> 01:14:40,645
She might finish the snacks.
- The liquor is enough for us.

1227
01:14:40,756 --> 01:14:41,882
ls that so? Ok.

1228
01:14:43,192 --> 01:14:45,217
We will be back in
a while, ok? Come.

1229
01:14:53,302 --> 01:14:54,997
lt must be too spicy for her.

1230
01:14:57,473 --> 01:14:59,907
O God! l can't drink water
from their water bottles.

1231
01:15:08,784 --> 01:15:10,081
O God! Look there.

1232
01:15:10,453 --> 01:15:12,080
You can't bear to see this sight.

1233
01:15:14,423 --> 01:15:17,358
Who is she? People eat
stuff after having a drink.

1234
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:19,257
But she is drinking after
eating stuff. - Our misfortune.

1235
01:15:20,429 --> 01:15:22,397
Oh !
- What's the matter? What happened?

1236
01:15:22,932 --> 01:15:24,058
We don't know if she does it
intentionally or unintentionally..

1237
01:15:24,166 --> 01:15:26,657
..but that girl is drinking again.

1238
01:15:33,743 --> 01:15:34,937
She is drinking in broad daylight.

1239
01:15:35,044 --> 01:15:36,739
You tell that to her. Go.

1240
01:15:40,349 --> 01:15:41,338
You came here?

1241
01:15:42,351 --> 01:15:44,285
l came for you.
- For me?

1242
01:15:44,854 --> 01:15:48,051
Exams are over. l will
go our to my village..

1243
01:15:48,157 --> 01:15:52,116
..and tell my father
about our love story.

1244
01:15:52,995 --> 01:15:57,830
lf he says yes we'd
directly consummate our wedding.

1245
01:15:57,934 --> 01:15:59,128
She brought up the
topic of marriage?

1246
01:15:59,235 --> 01:16:01,032
Quite natural. She is drunk.

1247
01:16:06,509 --> 01:16:09,342
You are too drunk. Come
with me l will tell you. Come.

1248
01:16:09,845 --> 01:16:31,189
TorrentRockerz

1249

''..and remove all the shackles?''

1255
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:52,353
''Shall l take you into my arms?''

1256
01:16:52,455 --> 01:16:54,116
''Shall l kill the cold?''

1257
01:16:54,223 --> 01:16:57,249
''Shall l shower you with kisses?''

1258
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:00,523
''This is the root cause of
fight between you and me.''

1259

1285
01:19:39,054 --> 01:19:40,146
Greetings, sir.
- You can greet me later on.

1286
01:19:40,256 --> 01:19:41,484
First of all check
my nephew's condition.

1287
01:19:42,358 --> 01:19:43,689
When can l go out?

1288
01:19:44,093 --> 01:19:45,924
lt will take a week for
your back to get well.

1289
01:19:46,328 --> 01:19:48,023
Three weeks for
your neck to get well.

1290
01:19:48,364 --> 01:19:50,127
lt might take one month
for your leg to get well.

1291
01:19:51,066 --> 01:19:53,057
Totally how many days will it take?
- lt might take six weeks.

1292
01:19:55,204 --> 01:19:56,501
What's this, sir! You
want to commit suicide..

1293
01:19:56,605 --> 01:19:57,629
..just because you can't
wait for another six weeks?

1294
01:19:57,740 --> 01:20:01,574
Why would l die? l will
kill that Chanti. - No.

1295
01:20:03,179 --> 01:20:05,704
Their family is already
half dead in your hands.

1296
01:20:06,382 --> 01:20:09,681
You did what l
couldn't do for 20 years.

1297
01:20:11,253 --> 01:20:13,187
One person has gone from that house.

1298
01:20:13,589 --> 01:20:16,057
l am very happy.
- Come outside. Come outside.

1299
01:20:16,158 --> 01:20:19,594
Come outside. Come outside.

1300
01:20:20,095 --> 01:20:22,359
What's that? Who are they?
- Victims.

1301
01:20:22,698 --> 01:20:25,132
Flood victims.
- No. The victims of our flats.

1302
01:20:25,334 --> 01:20:27,529
The victims of our flats? l am
going to.. - Brother-in-law.

1303
01:20:28,437 --> 01:20:31,201
You stay here. l will see them.
- Come outside. Come outside.

1304
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:33,672
Why are you shouting?
- You wait a minute.

1305
01:20:33,776 --> 01:20:37,212
Stay quiet. Stay quiet. Stay
quiet. Sir is not at home.

1306
01:20:37,413 --> 01:20:39,142
Had you come here 10
minutes ago you would've got sir.

1307
01:20:39,315 --> 01:20:42,045
Come tomorrow. - What! So
that you'd shut shop by then?

1308
01:20:42,151 --> 01:20:43,778
l will see your end.
- What will you see?

1309
01:20:44,053 --> 01:20:46,112
His hand is broken and the
other one's leg is broken.

1310
01:20:46,222 --> 01:20:47,689
Beating them is equal to
beating a dog. Go away.

1311
01:20:47,756 --> 01:20:49,519
What are you saying! R.
K. Builders are selling..

1312
01:20:49,592 --> 01:20:51,457
..flats for five lakhs and
you are charging 15 lakhs..

1313
01:20:51,527 --> 01:20:53,620
..for the same flats.
- lt's not for nothing.

1314
01:20:53,729 --> 01:20:55,162
A flat's cost depends
on the cost of the land.

1315
01:20:55,264 --> 01:20:58,199
Really! Their flats are
right next to your flats.

1316
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:01,394
Let's not get into this discussion.
- lt's not possible.

1317
01:21:01,503 --> 01:21:03,027
lf it's not possible
we will take you scruff.

1318
01:21:03,138 --> 01:21:04,332
You'll take me with scruff?
- What's the matter?

1319
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,567
Your voice is rising?
- You went out 10 minutes ago.

1320
01:21:06,675 --> 01:21:09,473
You returned so fast?
- Your intentions are clear by this.

1321
01:21:09,578 --> 01:21:11,637
Hey, if you raise your
voice l will slash your tongue.

1322
01:21:11,747 --> 01:21:14,113
Bring your hand down. We are
giving you one week's time.

1323
01:21:14,216 --> 01:21:15,444
Till then if you don't
return our money.. -Hey.

1324
01:21:15,551 --> 01:21:17,280
lf you don't return our
money we will go to the assembly.

1325
01:21:17,486 --> 01:21:18,680
We will ruin your
reputation in front of the media.

1326
01:21:18,754 --> 01:21:20,051
We will shut down your company.

1327
01:21:20,155 --> 01:21:21,144
Let's go. Let's go.

1328
01:21:22,091 --> 01:21:23,080
Just one week's time.

1329
01:21:24,193 --> 01:21:25,182
What's this, brother-in-law!

1330
01:21:25,361 --> 01:21:27,454
Even these beggars are
spitting on our faces.

1331
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:31,457
Rama Krishna is trying
to get smart with me.

1332
01:21:31,827 --> 01:21:33,124
l will give him a major blow.

1333
01:21:34,463 --> 01:21:35,521
Kill him without anyone's knowledge.

1334
01:21:35,631 --> 01:21:37,258
Srinu. - Yes. - Do you really have
to mortgage your locket..

1335
01:21:37,366 --> 01:21:39,197
..and throw a party?
- Nani is asking for the party..

1336
01:21:39,301 --> 01:21:41,462
..since a long time.
- Your family won't say anything?

1337
01:21:41,570 --> 01:21:43,333
Why would my family say anything!
lt's Nani's chain.

1338
01:21:43,438 --> 01:21:44,530
You..

1339
01:21:45,741 --> 01:21:47,641
Hey, Bachi is here.

1340
01:21:49,444 --> 01:21:51,503
Why is he coming here with his men?

1341
01:21:52,347 --> 01:21:53,336
l think he is not content
with the coating you gave him..

1342
01:21:53,448 --> 01:21:54,506
..a few days ago. So he
is coming here to get..

1343
01:21:54,616 --> 01:21:55,605
..another thrashing.

1344
01:21:56,752 --> 01:21:58,481
We can throw the
party for Nani later on.

1345
01:21:58,654 --> 01:22:00,121
Let us first give him a
dressing down. - Right.

1346
01:22:08,897 --> 01:22:10,626
You wanted to give them a
thrashing. You came back?

1347
01:22:10,732 --> 01:22:11,858
My father is buying fruits here.

1348
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:14,364
He kicked me out of the
house as l thrashed him once.

1349
01:22:14,469 --> 01:22:15,458
lf he sees me thrashing him again..

1350
01:22:15,571 --> 01:22:16,595
He will also leave the house?

1351
01:22:17,072 --> 01:22:18,369
He won't let me step
inside the house again.

1352
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:20,298
Because of our Amitabh Bachchan..

1353
01:22:20,409 --> 01:22:21,467
..this Gabbar Singh has escaped.
Let's go. Let's go.

1354
01:22:35,534 --> 01:22:36,501
Come here.

1355
01:24:49,267 --> 01:24:51,030
Father, he came to kill you.
- Shut up!

1356
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:53,463
Why would he come to kill
me? Am l a goon like you?

1357
01:24:53,572 --> 01:24:54,903
He's the one who came to
our house that day, right?

1358
01:24:55,674 --> 01:24:58,006
Hey, you will never change.
- That's not the thing, father..

1359
01:24:58,110 --> 01:24:59,600
No, don't show me your face again.

1360
01:24:59,711 --> 01:25:00,803
Father. Father, listen to me.

1361
01:25:00,912 --> 01:25:02,038
Father, listen..

1362
01:25:25,804 --> 01:25:28,034
Have you knocked down Purushottam?

1363
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:29,437
Knocked down?

1364
01:25:29,841 --> 01:25:31,468
You are safe only till l am at home.

1365
01:25:31,910 --> 01:25:35,869
When l am outside no one can
stop me. l'll slash your heads.

1366
01:25:36,515 --> 01:25:40,975
Till l am here you
can't even touch my family.

1367
01:25:43,121 --> 01:25:44,349
Chanti!

1368
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:55,757
Why are you like that?

1369
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:00,428
What happened?

1370
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,601
l thought he would change
when he is away from home.

1371
01:26:05,377 --> 01:26:08,039
He will not change in this birth,
brother. - He will change.

1372
01:26:08,146 --> 01:26:09,636
l don't think so, brother.

1373
01:26:10,449 --> 01:26:14,351
Every time l see him l feel
like why l am still alive.

1374
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:19,614
Even when l think of him l
feel like dying, brother.

1375
01:26:30,168 --> 01:26:31,157
Sir.

1376
01:26:33,071 --> 01:26:35,938
Sir. What's the matter,
sir? Are you not well?

1377
01:26:36,041 --> 01:26:37,372
No, it's not that.. Just..

1378
01:26:37,476 --> 01:26:39,376
Move aside. Move aside.
What will you settle?

1379
01:26:39,644 --> 01:26:41,839
Will you steal at home or
will you sell your home?

1380
01:26:41,913 --> 01:26:43,972
Hey, what's going on ! Who are they?

1381
01:26:44,082 --> 01:26:45,811
Sir, we are cricket bookies.

1382
01:26:45,917 --> 01:26:47,475
ln 20-20 series that
took place a few days ago..

1383
01:26:47,586 --> 01:26:50,054
..they betted 10
lakh rupees and lost it.

1384
01:26:50,155 --> 01:26:52,146
l am asking for that money
and they are making us..

1385
01:26:52,390 --> 01:26:54,722
..revolve around them.
- What is he saying!

1386
01:26:58,130 --> 01:27:00,690
lt's not that we can't extract it.

1387
01:27:00,766 --> 01:27:02,097
We came to your office.

1388
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:04,065
We can even come to
your home to extract it.

1389
01:27:04,536 --> 01:27:07,505
But before that we just
wanted to inform you about it.

1390
01:27:07,706 --> 01:27:09,731
Please. Please.

1391
01:27:12,644 --> 01:27:14,441
Mr. Shivamani.
- Yes.

1392
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:17,178
Settle their account and send them.
- Ok, sir.

1393
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:18,946
Come.
- Goodbye, sir.

1394
01:27:24,689 --> 01:27:26,850
What's this! Do we need all this?

1395
01:27:27,025 --> 01:27:28,788
lsn't our hard-earned
money enough for us?

1396
01:27:28,894 --> 01:27:30,122
Do we have to gamble
to make a few bucks?

1397
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:32,588
There are a lot of
people depending upon us..

1398
01:27:32,697 --> 01:27:35,495
..and our company. lf
such news leaks out..

1399
01:27:35,567 --> 01:27:37,535
..can your father take it?
And what do you lack?

1400
01:27:37,636 --> 01:27:38,762
l give you as much
money as you want.

1401
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:40,770
Hey, who are you to give us money?

1402
01:27:40,972 --> 01:27:41,996
This is our father's property.

1403
01:27:43,575 --> 01:27:45,042
You are behaving as if
you are giving us money.

1404
01:27:45,143 --> 01:27:46,701
We would spend our
money the way we want to.

1405
01:27:46,812 --> 01:27:47,779
Who are you to question us?

1406
01:27:49,114 --> 01:27:50,775
We have to ask you for
money even if we have to buy..

1407
01:27:50,882 --> 01:27:53,578
..undergarments for our
kids and saris for our wives.

1408
01:27:53,718 --> 01:27:55,618
What an unfortunate life!
- Our father gave your son and you..

1409
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:58,188
..shelter in our home
after your wife died.

1410
01:27:58,456 --> 01:28:00,856
Hey, you are also a worker in
this company like everyone else.

1411
01:28:00,926 --> 01:28:02,917
They get salary and you get respect.

1412
01:28:03,128 --> 01:28:04,891
You are a worker.
Don't forget your limits.

1413
01:28:06,231 --> 01:28:09,428
lf you try to get
smart with us.. Let's go.

1414
01:28:36,161 --> 01:28:39,961
Doctor. - lt is very that
the first attack is so serious.

1415
01:28:40,065 --> 01:28:42,932
Did he hear some shocking news?
- No, doctor.

1416
01:28:43,034 --> 01:28:45,059
My brother is
worried only about his son.

1417
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:48,205
He put himself in
trouble thinking about his son.

1418
01:28:48,607 --> 01:28:51,508
His condition is critical,
Mr. Rama Krishna.

1419
01:28:51,743 --> 01:28:54,974
Whatever amount it costs my
brother must survive, doctor.

1420
01:28:56,648 --> 01:28:58,639
We will try our best, sir.

1421
01:29:08,093 --> 01:29:12,086
'Even when l think of him l
feel like dying, brother.'

1422
01:29:16,134 --> 01:29:19,535
You came to see if he is
dead or alive? - Uncle.

1423
01:29:19,804 --> 01:29:21,965
l could fill your
pocket with money..

1424
01:29:22,073 --> 01:29:24,633
..but l couldn't fill
your heart with love.

1425
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:29,804
He might even die if he sees you.

1426
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:36,152
You might not need your father,
but l need my brother.

1427
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:38,756
l need him.

1428
01:30:17,062 --> 01:30:19,155
Why are you sitting here, Chanti?

1429
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:23,699
l can't see father
in such condition.

1430
01:30:42,454 --> 01:30:44,820
Nothing would happen to you,
uncle. Have faith in God.

1431
01:30:45,056 --> 01:30:46,182
You will get well soon.

1432
01:30:50,195 --> 01:30:51,890
What's the use even
if l get well, dear?

1433
01:30:53,665 --> 01:30:56,133
l couldn't even
bring up my son well.

1434
01:30:57,068 --> 01:30:58,695
Don't talk like that
about Chanti, uncle.

1435
01:30:59,771 --> 01:31:02,865
You are a fortunate man
to get a son like him.

1436
01:31:03,908 --> 01:31:07,742
lf he wasn't there l
wouldn't have been alive today.

1437
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:11,373
What are you saying, girl?
- On the day of engagement..

1438
01:31:11,483 --> 01:31:14,179
..he fought those
goons for me, uncle.

1439
01:31:15,353 --> 01:31:18,754
l went to shopping for
Shailu's engagement and..

1440
01:31:25,964 --> 01:31:28,762
Even though you
mistook him insulted him..

1441
01:31:28,867 --> 01:31:32,928
..Chanti left home silently
only to hide this truth, uncle.

1442
01:31:33,872 --> 01:31:38,002
You should be happy about
Chanti, but not be upset.

1443
01:31:39,844 --> 01:31:41,778
l want to see him immediately, dear.

1444
01:31:47,318 --> 01:31:50,879
Chanti, your
father wants to see you.

1445
01:31:52,157 --> 01:31:55,183
Really? - He called
you immediately. Go fast.

1446
01:32:14,312 --> 01:32:15,301
Father.

1447
01:32:23,888 --> 01:32:24,877
Sit down.

1448
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:35,058
Forgive me.
- What are you saying, father!

1449
01:32:36,367 --> 01:32:38,858
By the time l came
to know about you..

1450
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:42,133
..my time has.. - You will be
fine, father. You will be fine.

1451
01:32:42,841 --> 01:32:45,469
l am not scared. l
have the satisfaction..

1452
01:32:45,577 --> 01:32:48,444
..that l fathered a great son.
- Don't talk like that, father.

1453
01:32:50,748 --> 01:32:52,773
All these days l
couldn't understand you.

1454
01:32:53,918 --> 01:32:56,113
l felt upset that you
hadn't done anything..

1455
01:32:56,221 --> 01:32:59,748
..but l didn't think even
once what l had done for you.

1456
01:32:59,858 --> 01:33:00,950
Don't talk about all
that at this time, father.

1457
01:33:01,059 --> 01:33:03,425
As a father l
haven't given you property.

1458
01:33:04,162 --> 01:33:05,527
l am giving your responsibilities.

1459
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:10,263
Both your brothers are trying
to make money though shortcuts.

1460
01:33:10,368 --> 01:33:11,392
l know that, father.

1461
01:33:14,906 --> 01:33:18,535
Take good care of..
Take good care of uncle.

1462
01:33:18,810 --> 01:33:19,777
l will, father.

1463
01:33:22,947 --> 01:33:25,108
Doctor. Father. Father.

1464
01:33:25,216 --> 01:33:26,205
Father. Father.

1465
01:33:31,022 --> 01:33:32,580
Father. Father.

1466
01:33:33,525 --> 01:33:34,514
Father.

1467
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:37,754
Father. Father. Father.

1468
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:38,851
Father.

1469
01:33:52,844 --> 01:33:54,038
Sir, our Chanti..

1470
01:34:14,199 --> 01:34:16,064
Who does he have
other than you, sir!

1471
01:34:16,434 --> 01:34:20,427
All those relations
died with my brother.

1472
01:34:22,307 --> 01:34:26,403
When he is not there l
don't want anyone else!

1473
01:34:40,024 --> 01:34:41,013
Lord!

1474
01:34:41,893 --> 01:34:42,882
Open it.

1475
01:34:46,030 --> 01:34:48,396
You never donated even a
single rupee till now..

1476
01:34:48,499 --> 01:34:51,195
..and today you donated ten lakhs?

1477
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:55,270
We spent 25 lakhs, but
couldn't kill Purushottam.

1478
01:34:55,473 --> 01:34:57,100
Without a knife, without
any spilling of blood..

1479
01:34:57,208 --> 01:35:00,041
..without any case,
without spending a single rupee..

1480
01:35:00,144 --> 01:35:02,009
He killed him just like that.

1481
01:35:03,214 --> 01:35:06,240
l took a decision today.
God is my partner.

1482
01:35:06,351 --> 01:35:08,546
You are so happy that it
seems like you would..

1483
01:35:08,653 --> 01:35:11,281
..donate a golden crown for lord.
- Just a crown?

1484
01:35:12,190 --> 01:35:15,353
lf his family is destroyed l
would even build a temple.

1485
01:35:15,627 --> 01:35:17,151
His brother is not there.

1486
01:35:17,562 --> 01:35:20,122
l will trap that Rama
Krishna in a new problem everyday..

1487
01:35:20,231 --> 01:35:22,222
..and play with him.

1488
01:35:35,546 --> 01:35:38,515
Hey, Nani!
- Hey, Nani?

1489
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:41,345
Thank God she didn't call me coolie.

1490
01:35:41,452 --> 01:35:43,977
Why did she come here at this time?

1491
01:35:44,188 --> 01:35:45,917
Are you out of your mind?
- l am the one..

1492
01:35:46,024 --> 01:35:47,252
..who should look after him
when he is in trouble, right.

1493
01:35:47,358 --> 01:35:49,952
Bring the luggage in.
- What do you think this is?

1494
01:35:50,061 --> 01:35:53,258
A shed or lodge? Someone
is checking-in everyday.

1495
01:35:58,603 --> 01:36:00,332
l told father about our love affair.

1496
01:36:00,471 --> 01:36:02,132
He ignored it and is
looking for a match for me.

1497
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:04,203
We have our own sketches.

1498
01:36:04,342 --> 01:36:06,333
l told him that l want to study
further and got into Godavari.

1499
01:36:06,444 --> 01:36:09,038
You came here to study,
right? Go to uncle's place.

1500
01:36:09,147 --> 01:36:12,207
To uncle's place? l should be
with you at such times, right?

1501
01:36:12,317 --> 01:36:14,342
Why are you standing like
a donkey? Tell him, uncle.

1502
01:36:14,452 --> 01:36:16,511
Donkey? Ok, girl.

1503
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:18,621
Even though you hurt me
by calling me donkey..

1504
01:36:18,723 --> 01:36:20,088
..you touched my heart
by calling me uncle.

1505
01:36:20,191 --> 01:36:21,556
You stay here, girl. You stay here.

1506
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:23,591
You can say whatever you say,
but she will stay here.

1507
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:25,390
She will stay here?
You are recommending her?

1508
01:36:25,563 --> 01:36:26,552
Aren't there
enough problems at hand?

1509
01:36:26,664 --> 01:36:27,722
You won't have any problem with me.

1510
01:36:27,965 --> 01:36:29,398
You sleep in one room and l
will sleep in another room.

1511
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:31,263
This is not Mysore
Palace to have so many rooms.

1512
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:33,132
There is only one room.
- Then in that room..

1513
01:36:33,237 --> 01:36:35,330
..l will sleep on the
floor and you sleep on the bed.

1514
01:36:35,406 --> 01:36:36,668
And then your studies
would be completely ruined.

1515
01:36:36,774 --> 01:36:38,071
Don't you understand what l say?

1516
01:36:38,276 --> 01:36:40,005
You can't stay here. Go away.

1517
01:36:57,161 --> 01:36:58,526
And then..

1518
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:05,294
She's alone here. lt seems she
came straight from her village.

1519
01:37:05,703 --> 01:37:07,102
Shall we ask her?
- Come on.

1520
01:37:08,206 --> 01:37:09,230
Let's go.

1521
01:37:16,114 --> 01:37:17,103
Will you come with me?

1522
01:37:21,486 --> 01:37:24,580
Yes, l will. - What's this! She a
greed to come so soon.

1523
01:37:24,689 --> 01:37:26,680
She's an item. Can't you see that?

1524
01:37:27,658 --> 01:37:28,716
Talk about her price beforehand..

1525
01:37:28,826 --> 01:37:30,691
..otherwise she will give
us trouble later. - Right.

1526
01:37:33,598 --> 01:37:34,565
How much?

1527
01:37:35,566 --> 01:37:38,831
l mean what's the rate.
- l don't know all that.

1528
01:37:39,303 --> 01:37:41,271
My man is there inside.
Go and ask him.

1529
01:37:43,541 --> 01:37:45,133
The mediator is there upstairs.

1530
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:52,605
Who's that?

1531
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:57,215
Who are you? Why did you
come here at this time?

1532
01:37:57,321 --> 01:38:00,290
There's one item outside.
Just wanted to know its rate.

1533
01:38:00,391 --> 01:38:01,415
What's there outside?
- Brother, they are talking..

1534
01:38:01,526 --> 01:38:04,154
..about the old Hero Honda bike
that's there outside. Sell it.

1535
01:38:04,862 --> 01:38:07,057
Didn't you get some
other time to negotiate?

1536
01:38:07,165 --> 01:38:08,291
You come here at
any time you want to?

1537
01:38:08,399 --> 01:38:09,366
What's this got to
do with time, sir?

1538
01:38:09,467 --> 01:38:11,264
lt depends on our mood, right?

1539
01:38:11,369 --> 01:38:14,304
What? You liked it?
- We liked it a lot, sir.

1540
01:38:14,405 --> 01:38:16,100
Did you like the color?
- Superb, sir.

1541
01:38:16,207 --> 01:38:18,175
First of all tell us its rate.
We can't control ourselves, sir.

1542
01:38:18,276 --> 01:38:19,675
ls it so tempting?
- Yes.

1543
01:38:19,777 --> 01:38:21,802
Then pay 15,000 rupees.
- 15,000?

1544
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:23,478
You are surprised to hear 15,000?

1545
01:38:23,581 --> 01:38:25,674
lt's a great company. lt
would be very comfortable.

1546
01:38:25,783 --> 01:38:27,444
You saw the seat, right?
- lt's superb.

1547
01:38:27,552 --> 01:38:30,453
But 15,000 is still
too much. Make it 5,000.

1548
01:38:30,555 --> 01:38:33,786
What! 5,000? Then there's a black
one in the other shed.

1549
01:38:33,891 --> 01:38:35,620
You can take that one.
- No, we don't want a black one.

1550
01:38:35,693 --> 01:38:37,320
We want the white one.
- You want the white one?

1551
01:38:37,428 --> 01:38:38,622
Then pay 15,000 rupees and take it.

1552
01:38:38,729 --> 01:38:41,095
lt's still very new.
Police won't catch you.

1553
01:38:42,467 --> 01:38:44,367
Police won't catch us?
- They won't.

1554
01:38:44,469 --> 01:38:45,595
All the papers are available.

1555
01:38:46,571 --> 01:38:48,368
Papers?
- You didn't get it?

1556
01:38:49,106 --> 01:38:51,631
l am saying we have RC book,
insurance papers and all..

1557
01:38:51,742 --> 01:38:53,300
What are you talking about?
You are not talking about..

1558
01:38:53,411 --> 01:38:56,107
..the girl over there?
- The girl over there?

1559
01:38:59,417 --> 01:39:03,478
So you were bargaining
about the girl over there?

1560
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:05,553
l am not the owner of that vehicle.

1561
01:39:05,656 --> 01:39:07,556
He's there inside. l will call him.

1562
01:39:07,658 --> 01:39:08,886
Hey, someone came for your vehicle.

1563
01:39:09,861 --> 01:39:11,556
There are customers for Bhanu.

1564
01:39:11,662 --> 01:39:12,651
What's the rate, sir?

1565
01:39:14,432 --> 01:39:16,229
Sir, why are you beating us?

1566
01:39:16,434 --> 01:39:18,265
She's the one who asked us
to talk to you about the rate.

1567
01:39:18,936 --> 01:39:20,904
Go and ask that girl. Don't ask us.

1568
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:23,600
What's the matter you are
talking about rate and all!

1569
01:39:23,774 --> 01:39:25,901
What can l do! You
didn't let me come in.

1570
01:39:26,377 --> 01:39:27,935
What! That means you
would create a scene here?

1571
01:39:28,212 --> 01:39:30,680
lf you still don't let me come in..

1572
01:39:30,781 --> 01:39:33,341
..l will send whoever
comes here to you. - O God!

1573
01:39:33,451 --> 01:39:35,578
Where did l get this girl?
- On railway station.

1574
01:39:36,888 --> 01:39:37,912
Ok, come in.

1575
01:39:40,291 --> 01:40:19,726
TorrentRockerz

1576
01:40:19,864 --> 01:40:23,595
''Tell me where we shall go and

''Tell me fast. We

''Come to me. Come to me.
Decide the place.''

1583
01:40:46,357 --> 01:40:48,018
''The fire can't be
quenched any other way.''

1584
01:40:48,292 --> 01:40:50,226
''Why are you delaying, O beauty?''

1585
01:40:50,294 --> 01:40:53,889
''l will find a place
where no one would come.''

1586
01:40:53,998 --> 01:40:58,230
''Don't be hasty. l will take
you to the zenith of pleasure.''

1587
01:41:05,943 --> 01:41:09,504
''Tell me where we shall go and

''..eyes shouldn't be
able to see them.''

''l am ready to go there
even if it's far away.''

1597
01:42:07,004 --> 01:42:10,770
''On some branch.
- Monkeys will watch us.''

1598
01:42:10,875 --> 01:42:14,538
''On the hill.

Greetings, Mr. Rama Krishna.

1618
01:44:31,248 --> 01:44:33,716
You are wondering why the
enemy come to your home?

1619
01:44:34,585 --> 01:44:35,984
They say if an
auspicious ceremony takes place..

1620
01:44:36,086 --> 01:44:37,075
..in a house where
something has gone wrong..

1621
01:44:37,188 --> 01:44:38,177
..it's good for you.

1622
01:44:40,491 --> 01:44:42,755
Knowingly or unknowingly
your daughter's match..

1623
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:44,953
..was broken because of us.

1624
01:44:47,131 --> 01:44:48,621

1625
01:44:49,733 --> 01:44:52,258

1626
01:44:52,536 --> 01:44:54,731
..we came here to ask for your
daughter's hand for our son.

1627
01:44:58,309 --> 01:44:59,435
You can't fight him from the front.

1628
01:44:59,543 --> 01:45:01,511
So you want to stab him
on the back? Scoundrel.

1629
01:45:01,812 --> 01:45:06,681
They ditched you. And l
came to shake hands with you.

1630
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:10,042
lt's not in our culture to
ask our guests to leave.

1631
01:45:19,196 --> 01:45:21,096
l think still he
hasn't forgotten the past.

1632
01:45:21,198 --> 01:45:23,098
At least you talk to your father.

1633
01:45:23,567 --> 01:45:26,001
My father still didn't
get over uncle's death.

1634
01:45:26,103 --> 01:45:27,934
We will convince him. You carry on.

1635
01:45:31,842 --> 01:45:32,866
What are you saying, sister-in-law!

1636
01:45:52,329 --> 01:45:55,662
Hey, who let this goon
inside? Kick him out.

1637
01:45:55,799 --> 01:45:57,130
Sir, just listen to me once.

1638
01:45:57,835 --> 01:45:59,735
What shall l listen to?
Get out of here first.

1639
01:45:59,837 --> 01:46:02,203
My anger and l are the reason
behind what happened that day.

1640
01:46:02,306 --> 01:46:05,241
Scold me or beat me, but don't
show your anger on my sister.

1641
01:46:05,342 --> 01:46:07,503
Please. - l won't change
my decision for someone.

1642
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:09,101
So you would get your son
married against his wish..

1643
01:46:09,213 --> 01:46:11,044
..and ruin his life, sir?
- For me my family's reputation..

1644
01:46:11,148 --> 01:46:14,015
..is important. - We too
have reputation in society, sir.

1645
01:46:14,184 --> 01:46:17,517
l feel like laughing when
you talk about reputation.

1646
01:46:17,922 --> 01:46:21,881
A goon like you are Rama and
your uncle is a Dasharatha.

1647
01:46:21,992 --> 01:46:23,960
What sort of a family is yours!
- Hey!

1648
01:46:29,867 --> 01:46:32,233
How dare you ! You held
my collar in my own house?

1649
01:46:33,237 --> 01:46:34,226
l will kill you.

1650
01:46:41,879 --> 01:46:43,813
Beat me, sir. Why did you stop?

1651
01:46:44,181 --> 01:46:45,580
Beat me till your anger is gone.

1652
01:46:47,351 --> 01:46:49,615
You felt so angry when
l held your collar..

1653
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:54,016
l too felt the same way when a
goon held my uncle's collar, sir.

1654
01:46:55,059 --> 01:46:58,961
You are elders. You might not
have exchanged betel leaves.

1655
01:46:59,430 --> 01:47:00,829
But they have
exchanged their hearts.

1656
01:47:02,666 --> 01:47:04,759
Please make my sister
your daughter-in-law, sir.

1657
01:47:06,603 --> 01:47:08,730
lf you still think what
l have done is wrong..

1658
01:47:08,839 --> 01:47:11,933
..l will touch your feet.
- What are you doing!

1659
01:47:13,277 --> 01:47:14,369
A person who
touches someone's feet..

1660
01:47:14,645 --> 01:47:17,170
..for his sister's
welfare is not a goon.

1661
01:47:17,715 --> 01:47:20,240
You would conduct this marriage.
- No.

1662
01:47:20,684 --> 01:47:24,051
Till my uncle calls me back
l am not fortunate enough..

1663
01:47:24,154 --> 01:47:26,952
..to bless the couple.
Even if l am not there..

1664
01:47:27,057 --> 01:47:28,922
..my sister's marriage
should take place well.

1665
01:47:29,893 --> 01:47:32,384
Definitely! lt will
happen as you wish.

1666
01:47:50,814 --> 01:47:52,111
What's this, Shailu, you
are crying like a kid.

1667
01:47:53,250 --> 01:47:55,013
l am leaving without
meeting my youngest brother.

1668
01:47:56,286 --> 01:47:58,083
He didn't even come to the airport.

1669
01:47:58,155 --> 01:47:59,645
How can he come
when everyone is here!

1670
01:47:59,757 --> 01:48:01,054
We shall call him as soon
as we reach there. Come.

1671
01:48:01,925 --> 01:48:03,790
Excuse me, madam!
Somebody is calling you.

1672
01:48:09,033 --> 01:48:10,125
Sorry, you can't go out.

1673
01:48:35,859 --> 01:48:36,848
Let's go.

1674
01:49:01,318 --> 01:49:03,946
Uncle, l don't know
how to tell you this..

1675
01:49:04,021 --> 01:49:06,888
..but l saw your
daughter Bhanu with Chanti.

1676
01:49:08,158 --> 01:49:09,716
lt seems he trapped your daughter..

1677
01:49:09,827 --> 01:49:11,351
..when she was at our home.

1678
01:49:11,462 --> 01:49:12,451
Ever since she came
here Bhanu hasn't been..

1679
01:49:12,729 --> 01:49:14,697
..at our place
even for a day, uncle.

1680
01:49:14,932 --> 01:49:15,921
We came to know that
she has been staying..

1681
01:49:16,033 --> 01:49:17,193
..at the mechanic
shed along with him.

1682
01:49:17,334 --> 01:49:19,131
We have got nothing
to do with that goon.

1683
01:49:19,770 --> 01:49:21,431
Don't blame us if
something goes wrong tomorrow.

1684
01:49:21,905 --> 01:49:22,894
We called you here to make sure..

1685
01:49:23,006 --> 01:49:24,132
..that you reprimand your
daughter and take her back.

1686
01:49:26,243 --> 01:49:27,232
Alright.

1687
01:49:32,416 --> 01:49:33,405
Uncle.

1688
01:49:35,385 --> 01:49:36,977
Chanti is not such sort of a person.

1689
01:49:37,321 --> 01:49:38,413
They complained you against him..

1690
01:49:38,522 --> 01:49:40,251
..because of their personal enmity.

1691
01:49:40,390 --> 01:49:41,482
Chanti is a very nice guy.

1692
01:49:42,493 --> 01:49:43,892
You think l don't know that?

1693
01:49:47,798 --> 01:49:51,290
My daughter lies to me that
she's still staying at your place.

1694
01:49:51,835 --> 01:49:55,862
But the day Bhanu went
to him Chanti called me.

1695
01:49:57,074 --> 01:49:59,508
ln today's times when
children are eloping with someone..

1696
01:49:59,776 --> 01:50:02,404
..of their choice when
my daughter went to him..

1697
01:50:02,513 --> 01:50:04,242
..and asked to marry him he
called me to take her back.

1698
01:50:04,448 --> 01:50:07,383
At that particular moment l
decided that he's my son-in-law.

1699
01:50:08,318 --> 01:50:10,149
l didn't know what it
is when your husband..

1700
01:50:10,254 --> 01:50:12,085
..called me urgently. Had l
knew that this was the matter..

1701
01:50:12,189 --> 01:50:13,178
..l wouldn't even have
bothered to come here.

1702
01:50:13,290 --> 01:50:14,279
Goodbye, dear.

1703
01:50:17,995 --> 01:50:20,054
Hello!
- lt's me, Kalyani speaking.

1704
01:50:20,130 --> 01:50:21,825
Your father agreed to
your match with Chanti.

1705
01:50:22,833 --> 01:50:26,200
Really? Sister, if you were
here l would've kissed you.

1706
01:50:26,303 --> 01:50:29,238
Save your kisses till marriage
and give them to your husband.

1707
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:55,357
TorrentRockerz

1708
01:50:55,499 --> 01:50:59,595
''The white sari is ok. The
jasmine flowers are ok.''

1709

''l'll be ok if you
tie me nuptial thread.''

1713
01:51:14,851 --> 01:51:16,910
''l'll surrender myself to you.''

1714
01:51:17,020 --> 01:51:21,252
''l will present myself to you.''

1715
01:51:21,358 --> 01:51:25,351
''For me a cot is ok.
Your beauty is double ok.''

1716
01:51:25,462 --> 01:51:29,421
''l will make you scream at daytime.''

1717
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:33,959
''The white sari is ok. The
jasmine flowers are ok.''

1718
01:51:34,071 --> 01:51:38,030
''The arrangements are
ok. The music is ok.''

1719
01:52:08,071 --> 01:52:09,663
''l have gone crazy.''

1720
01:52:10,274 --> 01:52:12,037
''l am intoxicated in your love.''

1721
01:52:12,209 --> 01:52:14,109
''l was going wild.''

1722
01:52:14,411 --> 01:52:16,470
''Just a while ago.''

1723
01:52:16,580 --> 01:52:18,605
''l can't resist myself.''

1724
01:52:18,982 --> 01:52:20,677
''You are just yummy.''

1725
01:52:20,951 --> 01:52:22,578
''l am very eager..''

1726
01:52:22,686 --> 01:52:25,154
''..ever since you came.''

1727
01:52:25,222 --> 01:52:28,919
''Kill me with your looks
and take me into your arms.''

1728
01:52:29,126 --> 01:52:33,563
''Shower me with love
and make me your own.''

1729
01:52:33,630 --> 01:52:38,124
''Bring milk, fruits and a
pillow and let's make merry.''

1730
01:52:38,235 --> 01:52:42,729
''After l started blood..''

1731
01:52:43,006 --> 01:52:46,669
''..l bid goodbye to my sari,
it's ok, it's ok.''

1732
01:52:46,743 --> 01:52:50,645
''The white sari is ok. The

01:52:59,323 --> 01:53:04,056
''The wedding hall is ok.

1736
01:53:29,186 --> 01:53:30,744

''You have spoilt me completely..''

1742

1751
01:54:20,537 --> 01:54:25,270
''The wedding hall is ok.
The wedding chants are ok.''

1752
01:54:34,317 --> 01:54:36,683
What happened to you?
- l am celebrating.

1753
01:54:36,787 --> 01:54:39,119
My brother also turned out to
be a good for nothing fellow.

1754
01:54:39,222 --> 01:54:40,211
That's why l am celebrating.

1755
01:54:41,591 --> 01:54:43,718
When Purushottam
died you were ecstatic..

1756
01:54:43,827 --> 01:54:45,692
..that God was on our side.

1757
01:54:46,196 --> 01:54:47,663
What did we achieve from his death?

1758
01:54:48,131 --> 01:54:50,258
A marriage took place in
their house and we got nothing.

1759
01:54:51,268 --> 01:54:53,395
That day he got you
thrashed by the villagers..

1760
01:54:53,503 --> 01:54:56,529
..and today the flat buyers
are waiting to beat you to pulp.

1761
01:54:56,606 --> 01:54:58,233
Will you just apply
balm on our wounds..

1762
01:54:58,341 --> 01:54:59,706
..or will you ever get even?

1763
01:55:10,187 --> 01:55:11,518
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings.

1764
01:55:11,621 --> 01:55:13,384
There's a stay order
from the court. - Why?

1765
01:55:13,490 --> 01:55:14,479
This is endowment land. As
per law nothing can be..

1766
01:55:14,591 --> 01:55:16,616
..constructed here.

1767
01:55:33,543 --> 01:55:35,670
The papers are very
strong in the petition.

1768
01:55:36,146 --> 01:55:37,545
The registrar has
showed substantial proof..

1769
01:55:37,647 --> 01:55:39,547
..that it's an endowment land.

1770
01:55:39,649 --> 01:55:41,412
Find out how many ways there are..

1771
01:55:41,518 --> 01:55:42,678
..to go to court
against the stay order.

1772
01:55:43,453 --> 01:55:46,149
Jana Nivas' construction
shouldn't stop at any cost.

1773
01:55:46,356 --> 01:55:49,154
We can also go to the court.
But we don't know..

1774
01:55:49,259 --> 01:55:51,887
..how long it will take!
Even if we wait till then..

1775
01:55:52,162 --> 01:55:54,323
..there is no surety that the
verdict will be in our favor.

1776
01:55:54,431 --> 01:55:57,127
l became a minister after
sucking up to many people.

1777
01:55:57,234 --> 01:55:58,633
lf l keep on doing social service..

1778
01:55:58,735 --> 01:56:01,465
..when would l get back the
money l invested in elections.

1779
01:56:01,538 --> 01:56:03,529
No money, no work. Go away.

1780
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:05,471
Because of people like you l get BP.

1781
01:56:05,642 --> 01:56:07,337
People are ruthless.
They don't even think..

1782
01:56:07,444 --> 01:56:09,275
..that minister has to
survive and for that we should..

1783
01:56:09,379 --> 01:56:11,779
..give him a lakh or two every hour.

1784
01:56:11,882 --> 01:56:14,112
That's how people are, sir.
- Hey, stop nodding your head.

1785
01:56:14,217 --> 01:56:15,650
l stopped it, sir.

1786
01:56:15,752 --> 01:56:16,844
Tell me the program.
- Yes, sir.

1787
01:56:17,387 --> 01:56:19,821
At 10 O' clock there's a
private hospital's opening.

1788
01:56:19,923 --> 01:56:22,187
What will they give us there?
- There will take a free HlV test.

1789
01:56:22,959 --> 01:56:25,553
l don't want all that. Next?
- At 11 O' clock there is..

1790
01:56:25,662 --> 01:56:28,722
..Union Leaders' meeting.
- Will they give me anything?

1791
01:56:28,832 --> 01:56:31,426
They will give their demands.
- Ask them not to bother.

1792
01:56:31,535 --> 01:56:33,662
Tell me something that
would get me some money.

1793
01:56:34,871 --> 01:56:37,237
There's someone's call. Ask
him how much he will give me.

1794
01:56:38,408 --> 01:56:40,899
Hello! - lt's me, the
minister's brother-in-law.

1795
01:56:41,177 --> 01:56:43,441
Pass the phone to that idiot.
- Ok, sir.

1796
01:56:43,847 --> 01:56:47,681
lt's your brother-in-law, sir.
- Brother-in-law, you got money?

1797
01:56:47,784 --> 01:56:50,548
Truckloads of it. Come,
l will bury you in them.

1798
01:56:51,321 --> 01:56:55,417
What's this! Who is he?
- Lord Krishna.

1799
01:56:55,659 --> 01:56:58,253
You heard about Tehelka?
- You scoundrel!

1800
01:56:58,361 --> 01:56:59,794
You are the guy with camera?

1801
01:56:59,896 --> 01:57:01,158
l have saved your
history of taking bribes..

1802
01:57:01,264 --> 01:57:03,960
..and conquests on
bed in a cassette.

1803
01:57:04,234 --> 01:57:06,794
l got such threats before.
- By 11 O' clock when you..

1804
01:57:06,903 --> 01:57:09,701
..go to the Union Leaders' meeting..

1805
01:57:09,806 --> 01:57:12,775
..all your secrets will be
out and you'll lose your post..

1806
01:57:12,943 --> 01:57:15,707
Hey, who are you? What do you want?

1807
01:57:15,779 --> 01:57:17,440
lf you come to the place l
tell you within an hour..

1808
01:57:17,547 --> 01:57:19,447
..l will tell you
everything elaborately.

1809
01:57:20,684 --> 01:57:23,312
Where are you, buddy? l am here

1810
01:57:23,853 --> 01:57:26,651
Lord Krishna,
where are you? Tell me.

1811
01:57:26,990 --> 01:57:29,515
At least play the flute. l
will find out where you are.

1812
01:57:29,626 --> 01:57:32,993
Uncle. Uncle Kamsa, here..
- You are here?

1813
01:57:33,263 --> 01:57:34,662
How are you? - What's this,
uncle! You came along with..

1814
01:57:34,764 --> 01:57:37,756
..your entire family? You
are attending a wedding?

1815
01:57:37,867 --> 01:57:40,529
You thought of killing as soon
as you get the cassette, right?

1816
01:57:40,637 --> 01:57:44,403
lt's just personal security.
You know the dangers we face.

1817
01:57:44,507 --> 01:57:46,270
A few days ago when you
were going to a farmhouse..

1818
01:57:46,376 --> 01:57:47,934
..with a beautiful chick
the media chased you, right?

1819
01:57:48,311 --> 01:57:50,836
What did they do then?
- Don't get angry, buddy.

1820
01:57:50,981 --> 01:57:54,678
You know my history. lf you
wish you can bring me down.

1821
01:57:54,918 --> 01:57:56,510
My time is already
running pretty bad these days.

1822
01:57:56,620 --> 01:57:58,679
What happened to you?
- You enjoy 20 days a month..

1823
01:57:58,788 --> 01:58:01,621
..in foreign countries, right?
- lt's just for fun.

1824
01:58:01,725 --> 01:58:04,489
l have to take some bribes
to complete the construction..

1825
01:58:04,594 --> 01:58:08,826
..of my hotel in Bangkok,
that's all.

1826
01:58:08,932 --> 01:58:10,297
You don't get
anything when you take..

1827
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:12,595
..girls' abroad with
fake passports, uncle?

1828
01:58:12,702 --> 01:58:15,899
lt's not running well.
Last month l sent..

1829
01:58:16,006 --> 01:58:18,804
..just one girl to Dubai.
- l heard recently Umapati..

1830
01:58:18,908 --> 01:58:20,899
..gave you 4 crores to halt
an R. K. Builders' venture.

1831
01:58:21,011 --> 01:58:22,069
Did you devour the
entire amount, uncle?

1832
01:58:22,345 --> 01:58:24,074
He gave me just two crores for that.

1833
01:58:24,347 --> 01:58:26,281
That scoundrel told you
he gave me four crores?

1834
01:58:26,783 --> 01:58:29,843
Everyone is making me a fool
and playing with me, buddy.

1835
01:58:30,887 --> 01:58:32,047
lncluding you.

1836
01:58:33,623 --> 01:58:35,955
ls this your camera?

1837
01:58:36,826 --> 01:58:39,920
Did l say everything as you wished..

1838
01:58:40,030 --> 01:58:43,796
..or is there anything left?
You tried to expose me with it..

1839
01:58:43,900 --> 01:58:46,425
..and remove me from my post, kid?

1840
01:58:46,936 --> 01:58:48,301
Hey, kill him.

1841
01:58:55,545 --> 01:58:56,944
l don't think fighting
him is such a good idea.

1842
01:58:57,047 --> 01:58:58,036
You shut up! You go and kill him.

1843
01:59:38,021 --> 01:59:39,454
We are dead. We are dead.

1844
01:59:40,190 --> 01:59:42,351
All out, sir. lt would be
better if we jump from here.

1845
01:59:42,659 --> 01:59:44,593
Uncle.
- He called me.

1846
01:59:44,694 --> 01:59:47,663
l am a bit smarter than you.

1847
01:59:48,531 --> 01:59:50,829
Shall l give a finishing
touch to this episode?

1848
01:59:56,406 --> 02:00:00,536
l shot you even
better than my friend did.

1849
02:00:04,614 --> 02:00:05,740
You are scared?

1850
02:00:05,915 --> 02:00:07,678
There are lumps in your throat?

1851
02:00:08,151 --> 02:00:11,643
Lift the stay orders and
clear R. K. Builders' route.

1852
02:00:11,821 --> 02:00:14,984
Or else my friend Srinu's
talent will be shown on TV..

1853
02:00:15,091 --> 02:00:17,889
..and within an hour
your life would be ruined.

1854
02:00:17,994 --> 02:00:20,485
Don't go that far,
buddy. l will get it cleared.

1855
02:00:20,597 --> 02:00:21,757
Hey, come with me.

1856
02:00:21,865 --> 02:00:23,526
Are you out of your mind?

1857
02:00:23,633 --> 02:00:26,693
l need to first save my head.
Don't say one more word.

1858
02:00:26,936 --> 02:00:29,803
Hey, who is the guy
who filed the case?

1859
02:00:30,607 --> 02:00:33,167
Listen, you go there and
say they were fake cases..

1860
02:00:33,443 --> 02:00:35,104
..and take them back.
lf you are arrested..

1861
02:00:35,211 --> 02:00:37,111
..spend some time
in government jails.

1862
02:00:37,213 --> 02:00:39,044
What about the money
that you took from me?

1863
02:00:39,215 --> 02:00:40,910
Assume that you donated that money.

1864
02:00:41,017 --> 02:00:42,848
My condition is pathetic here.

1865
02:00:42,952 --> 02:00:48,185
Who is he who scared you so much?
l'll just kill him.. - Hey!

1866
02:00:48,591 --> 02:00:52,527
Dare to touch me. l will behead you.

1867
02:00:52,896 --> 02:00:54,523
How are you happy now?

1868
02:00:55,465 --> 02:00:59,128
Even if you move a stone
from R. K. Builders' buildings..

1869
02:00:59,235 --> 02:01:00,702
..l will bury you right there.

1870
02:01:00,804 --> 02:01:02,101
Hey!
- Hey!

1871
02:01:02,539 --> 02:01:04,507
Blade. l am a blade.

1872
02:01:04,607 --> 02:01:07,906
By the time you try to hit me
l will slit hundred throats.

1873
02:01:08,044 --> 02:01:10,808
Don't mess with R. K. Builders!

1874
02:01:11,848 --> 02:01:13,816
You saw that,
right? Hundred throats.

1875
02:01:13,983 --> 02:01:15,473
Your throats would
also be there among them.

1876
02:01:15,618 --> 02:01:18,451
Go fast and cancel the case. Go. Go.

1877
02:01:28,965 --> 02:01:31,832
We feared that our
dream of owning a house..

1878
02:01:31,935 --> 02:01:33,766
..would remain a dream,
but you are helping us..

1879
02:01:33,870 --> 02:01:35,895
..realize our dream, sir.
May god bless your family!

1880
02:01:38,908 --> 02:01:40,068
There are tears in your eyes?

1881
02:01:40,577 --> 02:01:42,841
l saw happiness in
my uncle's face again.

1882
02:01:44,514 --> 02:01:46,175
And l will see
happiness in your face..

1883
02:01:46,282 --> 02:01:48,716
..when your uncle
calls you back to home.

1884
02:01:53,289 --> 02:01:55,849
Even if you donate lakhs
of rupees in the temple..

1885
02:01:55,959 --> 02:01:57,119
..God is taking their side.

1886
02:01:57,660 --> 02:02:00,026
All your plans are
nullified by that Chanti.

1887
02:02:00,730 --> 02:02:04,291
l know how to outsmart that Chanti.

1888
02:02:04,567 --> 02:02:07,127
Hey! - Yes,
brother-in-law. - Call Bihari.

1889
02:02:07,737 --> 02:02:10,035
Terrorists planted
bombs in coconuts.

1890
02:02:10,206 --> 02:02:11,833
lt's hard to
survive in Hyderabad now.

1891
02:02:11,941 --> 02:02:13,203
l wonder who has
got that coconut now.

1892
02:02:17,614 --> 02:02:19,673
Brother, warding off the evil
eye isn't working out for us.

1893
02:02:19,782 --> 02:02:21,613
Drop this idea, brother.
- What!

1894
02:02:21,718 --> 02:02:24,050
You are scared that he would
also beat us? l'll hit you.

1895
02:02:26,556 --> 02:02:28,751
What's that, brother?
- There's a flower in it.

1896
02:02:28,858 --> 02:02:32,259
So? - lf we break it
we would reach the top.

1897
02:02:32,762 --> 02:02:34,923
Sir, can l break it?
- Wait a minute, Nani.

1898
02:02:35,098 --> 02:02:37,089
There's one more minute
left to the auspicious moment.

1899
02:02:38,001 --> 02:02:40,299
Brother. No, brother. Listen to me.
- What?

1900
02:02:40,904 --> 02:02:44,237
Don't talk like that fool. You
think l am an idiot? Look here.

1901
02:02:45,174 --> 02:02:46,801
What's that, brother?
- lt's a bag.

1902
02:02:47,176 --> 02:02:50,612
l will put this coconut
in this and break it..

1903
02:02:50,713 --> 02:02:52,544
..and there would be no damage.

1904
02:02:52,649 --> 02:02:57,109
Brother, l am so proud of you.
- Just wait and watch.

1905
02:02:58,121 --> 02:03:00,817
Can l break it now? - Yes,
the auspicious moment is here.

1906
02:03:00,924 --> 02:03:01,891
You can break it now.

1907
02:03:03,626 --> 02:03:06,959
l will break it, sir.
- Wait, Nani! - What, sir?

1908
02:03:07,063 --> 02:03:09,554
Come here. This is west.

1909
02:03:09,732 --> 02:03:11,996
Break it with your face
towards east. - ls it so?

1910
02:03:13,703 --> 02:03:14,692
So that's the matter.

1911
02:03:24,847 --> 02:03:25,836
Sir.

1912
02:03:32,422 --> 02:03:34,049
You are out of this world.

1913
02:04:01,985 --> 02:04:02,974
Hello!

1914
02:04:05,121 --> 02:04:06,110
What!

1915
02:04:07,123 --> 02:04:08,112
What's the matter? What happened?

1916
02:04:13,963 --> 02:04:15,123
We would be in a trouble
if we stay here for long.

1917
02:04:15,198 --> 02:04:16,187
Come with me.

1918
02:04:19,836 --> 02:04:22,327
Dear, it's not safe for
you to go there right now.

1919
02:04:25,475 --> 02:04:28,273
Father-in-law, the condition is
very critical there. Don't go.

1920
02:04:32,048 --> 02:04:33,606
Our sons are also not
there at home right now.

1921
02:04:33,983 --> 02:04:35,177
lf something goes
wrong here right now..

1922
02:04:35,284 --> 02:04:38,082
You want me to abandon them
as they are mere laborers?

1923
02:04:38,788 --> 02:04:40,756
They are the laborers who
sweated for our company.

1924
02:04:41,224 --> 02:04:43,192
l am ready to take a couple of
blows from them if they are angry.

1925
02:04:46,729 --> 02:04:49,892
What can be the reason? l
didn't see any earthquake.

1926
02:04:50,433 --> 02:04:52,196
lt's because lack of quality.

1927
02:04:52,368 --> 02:04:53,392
We quoted a flat with
-3,000 rupees per square feet..

1928
02:04:53,503 --> 02:04:56,063
..in that area and he said
he would give it for 600-700.

1929
02:04:56,172 --> 02:04:57,264
How is that possible?
lt's possible if you build..

1930
02:04:57,373 --> 02:04:59,102
..homes in this way.

1931
02:04:59,242 --> 02:05:02,109
l sympathize with the
poor families who lost..

1932
02:05:02,211 --> 02:05:05,669
..their loved ones' due to
the greed of R. K. Builders.

1933
02:05:28,204 --> 02:05:30,399
Open your eyes once.

1934
02:05:35,178 --> 02:05:36,145
Sir.

1935
02:05:36,846 --> 02:05:39,178
Sir, why did you come here?

1936
02:05:39,415 --> 02:05:41,474
You came to count the bodies?

1937
02:05:41,851 --> 02:05:44,911
My son came to work here
for the 200 you give per day.

1938
02:05:45,021 --> 02:05:47,216
You built these homes
with the greed for crores..

1939
02:05:47,323 --> 02:05:50,417
..and killed my son.
You killed my son.

1940
02:05:50,526 --> 02:05:52,050
That day you said
that you would fulfill..

1941
02:05:52,128 --> 02:05:54,926
..a poor man's dream. ls this
what is fulfilling our dreams?

1942
02:05:55,031 --> 02:05:57,829
We believed your words and
gave you all that we had..

1943
02:05:57,934 --> 02:06:01,199
..and you built such
homes with no quality at all.

1944
02:06:01,304 --> 02:06:04,171
Believe me. l didn't betray anyone.

1945
02:06:04,540 --> 02:06:06,098
You won't lose your money.

1946
02:06:07,210 --> 02:06:09,269
l will find out why this happened..

1947
02:06:09,378 --> 02:06:11,209
..and the reason behind this.

1948
02:06:11,314 --> 02:06:13,145
That will be known in the enquiry.
l am arresting you..

1949
02:06:13,249 --> 02:06:15,410
..as the precautionary action,
Mr. Rama Krishna.

1950
02:06:16,352 --> 02:06:17,819
He's the one who planted the bomb.

1951
02:06:28,397 --> 02:06:30,092
R. K. Builders are good people.

1952
02:06:30,199 --> 02:06:31,461
He's the black
sheep in their family.

1953
02:06:38,608 --> 02:06:40,041
Just because you didn't
get a share in the property..

1954
02:06:40,143 --> 02:06:42,236
..you plant bombs
and explode buildings?

1955
02:06:43,846 --> 02:06:44,870
lf there are differences
between you and your uncle..

1956
02:06:44,981 --> 02:06:46,812
..you solve it between you,
why do you take our lives..

1957
02:06:46,916 --> 02:06:47,905
..in your fight?

1958
02:06:49,485 --> 02:06:52,215
We need not talk to him. Thrash him.

1959
02:07:32,562 --> 02:07:35,793
The R. K. Builders'
collapsed buildings' controversy..

1960
02:07:35,898 --> 02:07:39,493
..took a new turn.
Chanti confessed that..

1961
02:07:39,602 --> 02:07:43,368
..he planted a bomb in it
for not getting a share..

1962
02:07:43,472 --> 02:07:46,407
..in the property. - He saved
the company with just one lie.

1963
02:08:00,056 --> 02:08:01,216
What have you done?

1964
02:08:01,624 --> 02:08:04,115
l didn't find any
other way to save my uncle.

1965
02:08:04,427 --> 02:08:07,487
That's why l lied that l
planted a bomb. - You lied?

1966
02:08:08,397 --> 02:08:10,297
But it has been proved
in the police report..

1967
02:08:10,366 --> 02:08:12,334
..that it happened to
due a bomb explosion.

1968
02:08:17,073 --> 02:08:18,973
lf you don't get the
person who planted the bomb..

1969
02:08:19,075 --> 02:08:20,975
..you can't escape
from this, Chanti.

1970
02:08:24,547 --> 02:08:26,310
Sir, we are in trouble.

1971
02:08:26,482 --> 02:08:29,451
That Bihari planted the bomb
even without my knowledge..

1972
02:08:29,552 --> 02:08:32,180
..but Chanti found it out.
- But Chanti is in jail, right?

1973
02:08:32,288 --> 02:08:34,051
He came out on bail an hour ago.

1974
02:08:34,223 --> 02:08:36,282
Listen to me and shift
him to some other place.

1975
02:08:36,392 --> 02:08:39,384
lf Chanti gets him you would
also go to jail along with him.

1976
02:08:50,373 --> 02:08:51,362
Find him.

1977
02:09:01,017 --> 02:09:02,143
He is right here, brother-in-law.

1978
02:09:03,152 --> 02:09:06,212
Hey, get up.
- What happened?

1979
02:09:06,322 --> 02:09:07,949
You have to get out of here,
or else Chanti will be here.

1980
02:09:08,057 --> 02:09:09,046
He is here.

1981
02:09:22,338 --> 02:09:25,205
They are a bit confused.
You come out.

1982
02:09:27,543 --> 02:09:29,943
Listen to me and shift
him to some other place.

1983
02:09:30,079 --> 02:09:33,014
lf Chanti gets him you would
also go to jail along with him.

1984
02:09:33,482 --> 02:09:35,450
May l go now?
- Where will you go?

1985
02:09:35,551 --> 02:09:36,643
The real game will begin now.

1986
02:09:37,553 --> 02:09:39,544
l was born with eagle eyes.

1987
02:09:39,622 --> 02:09:41,249
l am like a satellite.

1988
02:09:41,357 --> 02:09:43,052
l will find out wherever you hide.

1989
02:09:43,292 --> 02:09:46,284
l will take him to the court
whoever comes in my p0ath.

1990
02:09:46,395 --> 02:09:48,488
And with that you will be
confined to the jail forever.

1991
02:09:49,131 --> 02:09:50,155
Come on !

1992
02:09:50,533 --> 02:09:51,591
No one will escape.

1993
02:10:06,816 --> 02:10:09,478
Now you take him along. He
will tell the truth in the court.

1994
02:10:09,585 --> 02:10:13,214
Judge. l am the one
who planted a bomb..

1995
02:10:13,322 --> 02:10:16,120
..in Rama Krishna's
building and l did that..

1996
02:10:16,225 --> 02:10:19,194
..on Mr. Umapati's instructions.
He will tell the truth there.

1997
02:10:24,600 --> 02:10:26,591
Uma, if you stop it l
would start laughing.

1998
02:10:26,669 --> 02:10:28,432
You don't have a chance to laugh.

1999
02:10:29,171 --> 02:10:30,433
Then l would blow whistle once.

2000
02:10:37,246 --> 02:10:38,508
Does he have a camera shop?

2001
02:10:38,614 --> 02:10:40,514
He is coming here
with a brand new camera.

2002
02:10:41,684 --> 02:10:43,652
Like a Spiderman and Superman..

2003
02:10:43,753 --> 02:10:45,653
..l am a Cameraman.

2004
02:10:46,288 --> 02:10:48,483
Hey, l have
recorded whatever you did.

2005
02:10:48,591 --> 02:10:50,115
He has got a photogenic face.

2006
02:10:51,727 --> 02:10:54,457
When an illiterate goon
like you can be so smart..

2007
02:10:54,563 --> 02:10:56,463
..l am educated goon
how smart should l be?

2008
02:10:59,235 --> 02:11:01,795
O God! He is coming
again to get thrashed.

2009
02:11:15,050 --> 02:11:16,779
O God! One wicket down.

2010
02:11:17,453 --> 02:11:18,579
He is not match-fit anymore.

2011
02:12:04,166 --> 02:12:05,155
Chanti.

2012
02:12:12,208 --> 02:12:15,177
l wanted to quit the job
when Mr. Purushottam died.

2013
02:12:15,411 --> 02:12:18,642
l won't give you a chance
to dismiss me. l will leave.

2014
02:12:19,482 --> 02:12:20,813
Hey, you ! You are
trying to get smart with us?

2015
02:12:20,916 --> 02:12:22,747
You are supporting the guy
who exploded our building.

2016
02:12:22,852 --> 02:12:24,683
How much did you take from him?
- l'll break your teeth..

2017
02:12:24,787 --> 02:12:26,687
..if you say one more
word about Mr. Chanti.

2018
02:12:26,856 --> 02:12:29,347
Subramaniam!
- Forgive me, sir.

2019
02:12:29,925 --> 02:12:33,224
l couldn't bear it when they
were talking ill of Mr. Chanti.

2020
02:12:33,796 --> 02:12:37,254
When they fled with the fear
that they might get arrested..

2021
02:12:37,366 --> 02:12:41,132
..after the building
collapsed Mr. Chanti lied..

2022
02:12:41,237 --> 02:12:42,898
..that he planted a
bomb and got arrested..

2023
02:12:43,138 --> 02:12:44,605
..just to save you, sir.

2024
02:12:53,883 --> 02:12:55,316
Chanti!

2025
02:12:56,285 --> 02:12:57,377
Your daughter's
marriage that was cancelled..

2026
02:12:57,486 --> 02:13:00,284
..didn't happen when the
groom's family came back..

2027
02:13:00,389 --> 02:13:03,187
..but it happened when for
his sister your brother's son..

2028
02:13:03,292 --> 02:13:06,159
..went to them and touched
their feet to make it happen.

2029
02:13:13,235 --> 02:13:17,535
Because your son doubts
his wife and torments her..

2030
02:13:17,640 --> 02:13:21,406
..Mr. Chanti swallowed his
pride for his brother's wife..

2031
02:13:21,510 --> 02:13:22,670
..and left the home.

2032
02:13:31,921 --> 02:13:35,721
Your brother who
treated you as God..

2033
02:13:35,824 --> 02:13:39,590
..didn't die because of
his son, but because of..

2034
02:13:39,695 --> 02:13:42,493
..these gems' harsh
words he got a heart attack.

2035
02:13:49,204 --> 02:13:50,728
Don't believe him,
father. He is lying.

2036
02:13:50,906 --> 02:13:53,932
Shut up, you scoundrels!
Still you want to fool me?

2037
02:13:54,276 --> 02:13:57,439
l have only one son. Chanti.

2038
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:07,252
Hey, pour petrol on him.

2039
02:14:08,924 --> 02:14:12,883
Chanti, along with you your
evidence will also be destroyed.

2040
02:14:13,062 --> 02:14:16,031
Then your uncle would also
die with a heart attack..

2041
02:14:16,265 --> 02:14:17,323
..like your father died.

2042
02:14:17,900 --> 02:14:19,868
The fire of my
anger since 20 years..

2043
02:14:19,969 --> 02:14:22,563
..would be quenched
with these flames.

2044
02:14:42,791 --> 02:14:44,554
You dared to touch my son?

2045
02:14:44,960 --> 02:14:47,258
All these days he toiled for me.

2046
02:14:47,696 --> 02:14:52,599
Today l am ready to
die for him. Come on !

2047
02:15:10,486 --> 02:15:14,650
Hey! Burn Chanti
right in front of him.

2048
02:15:23,532 --> 02:15:26,262
Chanti.

2050
02:16:16,085 --> 02:16:19,919
All these days l
couldn't understand you.

2051
02:16:20,989 --> 02:16:23,685
For us you did so much..

2052
02:16:23,826 --> 02:16:25,885
How do l pay you back?

2053
02:16:26,361 --> 02:16:27,726
Don't talk like that, uncle.

2054
02:16:39,675 --> 02:16:41,006
Chanti.
- Uncle.

2055
02:16:41,176 --> 02:16:43,371
What's that dress! lt
didn't match you at all.

2056
02:16:44,646 --> 02:16:47,774
lt matches me. - l kept a
new dress for you in your room.

2057
02:16:47,883 --> 02:16:50,579
Wear that one.
- A new dress?

2058
02:17:05,067 --> 02:17:07,934
lt should be bright.
lt should like a dream.

2059
02:17:08,036 --> 02:17:10,596
Or else.. - l will turn
into a nightmare for you.

2060
02:17:13,408 --> 02:17:15,672
Ready. Smile please.
- Stop.

2061
02:17:16,578 --> 02:17:19,570
Sir, lot of people had
cast evil eyes on your family.

2062
02:17:19,748 --> 02:17:21,443
Let me ward off
those evil eyes, sir.

2063
02:17:21,550 --> 02:17:22,676
lf it goes wrong
you would die, Nani.

2064
02:17:22,785 --> 02:17:24,480
l am doing this to make
sure nothing goes wrong.

2065
02:17:24,586 --> 02:17:26,178
Om!

2066
02:17:31,193 --> 02:17:32,683
Nani, do it fast.

2067
02:17:37,199 --> 02:17:38,689
There's a flower in
it, sir. A flower.

Ready. Don't blind. Smile please.
