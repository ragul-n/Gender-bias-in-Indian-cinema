1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,250


3
00:02:53,792 --> 00:03:00,292
Legal loopholes exist mainly to safeguard
the innocent from being punished.

4
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:05,375
'EZHIL'

5
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,625
Dude...

6
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,250
The girl wearing green top?

7
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:36,000
Her name is Deepika.

8
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:39,750
She works for a movie website.
She writes reviews.

9
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,708
We both have different working hours.

10
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,292
Excuse me.

11
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,000
Sorry.

12
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:02,917
The only time I get to see her is
in the elevator every morning.

13
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,500
Exactly at 09:10.

14
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:10,083
If I miss out,
I won’t be able to see her all day.

15
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,500
She knows I see her.

16
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,583
At first, she deliberately avoided me.

17
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,917
The crowd would slowly thin out,

18
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:35,917
and by the 7th floor,
 we'd be the only two people left.

19
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,792
So, she will be left with no option.

20
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:41,875
She has to acknowledge me.

21
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,708
Then one day, I asked her.

22
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,500
Can I take you out for a cup of coffee?

23
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,792
Cheers, dude! What did she say?

24
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,042
You didn't tell me your name...

25
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,042
or introduce yourself.

26
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,042
But you’ve come straight to the point?

27
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,833
I only have 2 seconds.

28
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:14,000
You're on the 7th floor,
I'm on the 8th.

29
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,667
Where’s there time to waste?

30
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:17,417
She agreed to go out for coffee?

31
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:20,667
So...?

32
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,250
Your question is wrong.

33
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:25,667
Ask me the question the right way,
and we’ll go.

34
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,958
“Ask me the question the right way.”
What sort of an answer is that?

35
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:33,042
She should either agree to go
 with you or refuse.

36
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,708
Bye, dude! I need to leave now
to catch the elevator.

37
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,708
Okay, bye.

38
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,583
It's a feminist thing, right?

39
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:47,500
It's wrong to ask,
"Can 'I' take you out?"

40
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,708
I don't have a problem.

41
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:52,958
Will you take me out
for a cup of coffee?

42
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,333
Your question is still wrong.

43
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,583
Hold on...

44
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,250
You’re an equal rights champion.

45
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,958
"Can I take you out?"
"Will you take me out?"

46
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,292
Both questions are wrong.

47
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,417
Can we go out for a cup of coffee?

48
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:10,667
Sorry.

49
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,333
Give me a clue.

50
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:31,292
She is duping you, dude.

51
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:35,500
You're taking me for a ride,
aren't you?

52
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,708
No matter which way I ask,
you're only going to refuse.

53
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,917
I swear I'm not lying.

54
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,083
Ask me the question in the right way,
and we’ll definitely go out.

55
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,292
"Can I take you out
for a cup of coffee?"

56
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,667
"Will you take me out
for a cup of coffee?"

57
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,625
"Can we go out
 for a cup of coffee?"

58
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,500
Your question is wrong.

59
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,167
Ask me the question in the right way,
and we’ll go.

60
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,125
Darn, woman!

61
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,125
Tell me?
- I got it!

62
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,958
Tomorrow...
 she will go out with me.

63
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,292
It was a simple one.

64
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:37,500
But I was breaking my head
over it unnecessarily.

65
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,875
Can we have some hot tea?

66
00:07:47,042 --> 00:07:48,125
Let's go.

67
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,458
I hate coffee.

68
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:54,167
My name is Ezhil.

69
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:56,042
I know.
You're a civil engineer.

70
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,083
You work in the construction company
at the 8th floor.

71
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,667
You stay in Adayar.

72
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,333
You don't smoke or drink.

73
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,250
You love Ilaiyaraja's music.

74
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,000
What?

75
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,917
Don't know what to say.
You seem to know my bio-data!

76
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,250
'KAVIN'

77
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,458
See...

78
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,667
What is this?

79
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,333
It's an ATM machine, Seth!

80
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:47,792
What?
An ATM machine?

81
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:51,167
Why have you plucked it out
by the roots?

82
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:54,208
Haven’t you heard the news?
- I don't follow the news.

83
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,917
It’s our news that’s trending
 in all Andhra TV Channels.

84
00:08:57,292 --> 00:08:58,500
We picked it up at Tada.

85
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,917
We had planned
to break it open right there.

86
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:02,833
But we couldn't.

87
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,375
So we snatched the entire unit.

88
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,583
There are dents here.

89
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:09,375
We tried to break it open.

90
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,292
But only ended up
breaking two crowbars.

91
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,250
Why did you bring it here?

92
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,250
Do you know any ATM mechanics?

93
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:23,125
Someone who knows the mechanism
can open this easily.

94
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,167
They loaded cash into this machine
right in front of our eyes.

95
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,417
There should be at least
30 to 35 lakhs.  Easily.

96
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:34,375
They've brought a stolen ATM machine
loaded with cash.

97
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:35,917
But we couldn't open it.

98
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,083
Okay.
- I think he's found a guy.

99
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,500
I found a guy.

100
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:46,833
Didn’t I tell you?

101
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,292
But, he'll be here only tomorrow.

102
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:50,708
Tomorrow...?

103
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,375
Seth, carrying the machine around
in the vehicle is a big risk.

104
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,667
The cops are patrolling the streets.

105
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:03,167
You can keep it in my go-down
till the mechanic arrives.

106
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:08,917
It's okay, buddy.

107
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,833
I've known Seth for three years now.
He is trustworthy.

108
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,250
Seth, give us a couple of lakhs now.

109
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,875
When we open the machine
and find out how much money is in there...

110
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,292
we can discuss how
to share it.

111
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,583
What say?
- No way! Let the mechanic come.

112
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,042
Sorry, Seth.

113
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,375
There are six of us,
including the ATM security guard.

114
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,750
We need to give them something tonight.

115
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,125
I'll find another place.

116
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,500
Let's go.

117
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,458
I convinced him it’s better to do business
with a known scoundrel...

118
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:43,458
than with an unknown honest man.

119
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:44,708
Kavin...

120
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,458
I'll call you when the mechanic arrives.

121
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,792
Dad, the ATM mechanic is here.

122
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:55,958
Fools!  They didn’t know the money is here,
and instead tried to break it here.

123
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,292
They snatched this
at the Andhra border.

124
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,792
Seth, is the mechanic there yet?
You said he'd be there today!

125
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,292
Not yet! I will call you
when he is here.

126
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:12,917
Don't cheat us.

127
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,333
You must open the machine
only in our presence.

128
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,250
I know.
Hang up now.

129
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,917
You heard that?
There should be 30 to 35 lakhs.

130
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:25,292
Seth, you've been tricked!

131
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,208
This isn't original.
It's a fake.

132
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:28,083
A fake?

133
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:31,083
The 30 lakhs is not visible to my eyes.
Do you see it?

134
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:46,083
'Hocus-pocus! Hocus-pocus!
We all do it, hocus-pocus.'

135
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:52,083
'Teensy-weensy! Teensy weensy!
We all have teensy weensy addictions.'

136
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:57,708
'Desire is good, it makes you live longer.
Lie when you need to, it's okay to err.'

137
00:11:57,792 --> 00:12:03,958
'Make some cash, count your dough.
No point in locking up your gold.'

138
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,375
The man in blue shirt.

139
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,333
He is 65 years old.
A retired postmaster.

140
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,375
He posted an ad in the matrimony columns.
We met only yesterday.

141
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,208
He said he liked me right away!

142
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,708
Cover me.

143
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,458
You meant me?

144
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:21,833
Can it be seen?

145
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:23,250
Can what be seen?

146
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:26,208
I've been going with him from one temple
to another for the last 2 hours.

147
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:28,083
I'm going crazy
without a smoke.

148
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:35,708
What are you staring at?

149
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,042
This way the damage is only 50 percent.
So it's healthy!

150
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,708
Did you see that?

151
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,750
We're going on a date tomorrow.

152
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:47,500
Ask me how!
- How?

153
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,000
At first, a health check up at Apollo.

154
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,917
If we do it tomorrow,
we get a 10% discount!

155
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:56,708
Then a concert
at Naradha Ghana Sabha.

156
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,500
He says it was for someone like me
that he waited all these years!

157
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:03,750
Before these cigarettes kill me,
I think this bonehead's cheesy lines will!

158
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:07,500
He is smiling at me.

159
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,458
I told him you're my friend's son.

160
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,000
He'll be here in 5 minutes.

161
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,708
He wants us to get married
in January.

162
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:17,375
Before that, I'll somehow
get his account number.

163
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,375
He should have at least
5 to 10 lakhs.

164
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:21,000
We can clean him out.

165
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,875
I've worked out a proper plan.
What say?

166
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,792
You get a 20% cut.

167
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:34,583
Wish I could find a rich
cop or a government servant!

168
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:37,500
Are you on Instagram?

169
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,042
Bye!
- Oh, in Saligram.

170
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:39,792
Hold on.

171
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:42,792
My purse?

172
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:48,458
'No rules, no morals - There ain't no boss;
More money, more money - Make no noise!'

173
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:55,083
'No savings, no hoarding - That's how we roll;
 We feel no fear - We stand tall.'

174
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:00,583
'No rules, no morals - There ain't no boss;
More money, more money - Make no noise!'

175
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:06,917
'No savings, no hoarding - That's how we roll;
 We feel no fear - We stand tall.'

176
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:09,250
You think she saw us?

177
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:10,833
Even if she did,
she won't come in.

178
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,792
This is the gents' toilet.
We are safe here.

179
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,375
Why don't you answer my calls?
- She is here!

180
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,208
I've been calling you
for a week now!

181
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,875
I thought you'd get it.
- Get what?

182
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,750
This won't work out.

183
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:25,250
What, our relationship?

184
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:26,917
Of all the places
to discuss a relationship...

185
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,792
Then why did you give me hope?

186
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,792
Hope? Did I ever say
I loved you?

187
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,667
Did I say I'll marry you?
- No...

188
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:37,917
But we went to beach resorts
 a couple of times.

189
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,333
He says he is not interested.

190
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,500
We can't go unless you go now.

191
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,917
You came to the toilet
to escape from me didn’t you?

192
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,333
Is this where you break up, guys?

193
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,917
She saw him come in,
and followed him here.

194
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,042
Get it over with, man.

195
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:58,500
You pick up girls with ease
and dump them in 2 days!

196
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:01,083
They get boring after that.
- Boring?

197
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,833
Women are just like men.
They're all selfish.

198
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,042
I've invested my dad's entire savings
in this project.

199
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,000
My savings, too.

200
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:30,500
I'm building a
2 storeyed apartment.

201
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:32,167
Six units in total.

202
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,083
Premium 2 BHK Flats.

203
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:39,375
If this project is successful,
I'll make it.

204
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:40,708
Or else...

205
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:43,833
It will be successful.

206
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:00,958
I love you.

207
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:04,083
My dad is no more.

208
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:07,250
My mom is living with her husband in Dubai.

209
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:10,792
Second marriage.

210
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,750
I haven't seen her in 8 years.

211
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,375
She is happy
with her kids.

212
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,583
Your roommate isn't here?

213
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,000
No, she's working
the day shift.

214
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,625
I never thought I'd fall in love
with an engineer.

215
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:30,750
A writer... or a filmmaker...

216
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,292
I was hoping someone like that
would come into my life.

217
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,500
What's wrong
with an engineer?

218
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,083
They're boring!

219
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:40,000
Accounts, planning,
concrete, construction...

220
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,292
Life needs some magic, right?

221
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,375
You want magic, huh?

222
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,833
You took this picture
in Kolkata, right?

223
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yes.

224
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,833
You've seen Howrah Bridge?

225
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:56,500
Are you going to say
it's an engineering marvel?

226
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,875
You wear these without
a second thought...

227
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:03,875
Do you know the engineering behind this?
- Give that to me!

228
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Seriously!

229
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:09,125
The concept behind Howrah Bridge
 and this strapless bra is the same!

230
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,250
Think about it...
such a magnificent bridge.

231
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:14,292
And this...
both have the same design.

232
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,083
Give it back!
- It's the cantilever bridge principle.

233
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,125
Wait!

234
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:21,292
It's got no pillars.
But it can support any weight.

235
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,917
C’mon, isn't that magic?

236
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,500
Give it to me!
- You're saying that isn't magic?

237
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,708
This is something only engineering
can achieve, my sweetheart!

238
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:30,417
Fool!
- What?

239
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,167
That's my roommate's bra!
Have you no sense?

240
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,875
Give it!

241
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:36,375
Give it to me.

242
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:38,833
It's my shop.

243
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,375
Eighteen shops including mine.

244
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:43,750
We got caught
in a cheating case.

245
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,875
They sealed my shop shut.

246
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,917
My wife left after that,
and my life was done, too.

247
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,333
When did they seal your shop?

248
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,917
It was before we met.

249
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:54,875
It's been four years now.
I need to go to the court tomorrow.

250
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:57,000
There's a hearing.

251
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,375
The lawyer said
I'm getting a three year sentence.

252
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,167
You asked me why
I was in a bad mood since morning...

253
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,375
this is why!

254
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,417
The other shop owners are rich.

255
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:12,167
They'd be okay
even if they go to prison.

256
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,292
Have you got your case-file?

257
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,875
Why do you want to read that?

258
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:19,000
The lawyer's already read
it a hundred times.

259
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,667
I'll be going to prison anyway!

260
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,875
Three years in prison...
I'll get ripped apart.

261
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,833
I heard there are perverts in there.

262
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,958
If a handsome guy like me
ends up in prison...

263
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,250
that's it!

264
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:35,792
I'll get punctured!

265
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,042
How about you beat my face into a pulp?

266
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:43,000
The prison is dangerous
for good looking men like me.

267
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,292
It’s going to be oil massages for me
from tomorrow!

268
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:52,083
Ask for a discharge.
You'll get it.

269
00:18:52,417 --> 00:18:54,167
What? A discharge?

270
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,833
Are you kidding?

271
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,625
Your friend sold 33 computers
claiming it to be Dell.

272
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,208
Only the packing boxes
were original!

273
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:05,750
All 33 computers were fake.

274
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,917
He got caught red handed.

275
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:10,375
How can we get a discharge?

276
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,417
He’s getting three years, confirmed.

277
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:14,917
Did you read the seizure memo?

278
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:16,375
Why should I read that?

279
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,417
The charge sheet is very clear.

280
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,417
The memo mentions only the seizing
of the packing boxes.

281
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,875
There is no mention
of the computers.

282
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:32,000
Careless mistake!
The guy who wrote the memo screwed up.

283
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,000
This should be enough.

284
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:36,500
Ask for a discharge.
You'll get it.

285
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:58,417
There were 18 shop owners,
including me.

286
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,250
I was the only one
they let go.

287
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:06,083
'Play till the game is over, run till the end line;
The tide must rise to fall again.'

288
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:12,208
'You're a bright lad, with tricks up your sleeve'
Ain't no locks that you can't pick.'

289
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:18,125
'My heart is filled with a growing greed;
It makes a sound louder than the heartbeat.'

290
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:24,125
'The rooster crows only at dawn;
We all carry sorrow deep down.'

291
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,375
You know Suruli was embroiled in a case?

292
00:20:26,417 --> 00:20:28,792
It was Kavin who saved him
by finding a loophole.

293
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:31,917
What were you doing
before you met me?

294
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:33,625
What did you study?

295
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:35,958
12th grade!
- 12th grade?

296
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:39,667
Dude, even I am a Bachelor
of Commerce in Literature!

297
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:42,292
Why do you ask?
- It's just that...

298
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,083
you said something to the lawyer.

299
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:49,500
I could tell it was something technical,
but didn't know what!

300
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,583
Then the Judge released only me...

301
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,000
the other shop owners
were given 5 year sentences.

302
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,250
You speak some 6 or 7 languages.

303
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,083
You seem to know law points
that even lawyers don't know of.

304
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:00,458
So intelligent.

305
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:02,125
Who are you?

306
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:03,500
Who?

307
00:21:15,292 --> 00:21:18,167
'Oh, he's got me hooked.
He's making me blush.'

308
00:21:18,292 --> 00:21:21,125
'With a sideways glance,
He's got me head over heels.'

309
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:24,125
'Oh, he's got me hooked.
He's making me blush.'

310
00:21:24,292 --> 00:21:27,250
'With a sideways glance,
He's got me head over heels.'

311
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:30,083
'He's walking away.
He's making me sway.'

312
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:33,125
'Making me want to bridge the gap,
He's got me mousetrapped!'

313
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,833
I've known Kavin for 10 years.

314
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:36,667
I was the one who taught him the trade.

315
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,500
With his knowledge,
he could have bought this city.

316
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:44,125
But he lacks discipline and focus.
That's why he is like this!

317
00:21:44,292 --> 00:21:45,667
Heard he gambles a lot.

318
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,708
He has lost so much money!

319
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,708
That's his only minus.

320
00:21:50,917 --> 00:21:56,375
'No rules, no morals - There ain't no boss;
More money, more money - Make no noise!'

321
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:02,333
'No savings, no hoarding - That's how we roll;
 We feel no fear - We stand tall.'

322
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:08,500
'No rules, no morals - There ain't no boss;
More money, more money - Make no noise!'

323
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:14,625
'No savings, no hoarding - That's how we roll;
 We feel no fear - We stand tall.'

324
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:20,417
'No rules, no morals - There ain't no boss;
More money, more money - Make no noise!'

325
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:26,917
'No savings, no hoarding - That's how we roll;
 We feel no fear - We stand tall.'

326
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,625
I called him up last evening...

327
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,000
He said he has 6 lakhs ready...

328
00:22:31,042 --> 00:22:33,333
and that he'd give the remaining
2 lakhs within a week.

329
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,167
Now he says he doesn't have the money.

330
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,500
Are you playing games with me?

331
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,833
Of course not, brother.
- What, then?

332
00:22:50,042 --> 00:22:51,417
I took the money.

333
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:54,500
Suruli doesn't know.

334
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:56,792
You gambled?

335
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:02,667
You lost it all?

336
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:05,958
You lost all 6 lakhs?

337
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:08,500
In one sitting?

338
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:12,333
Did you know that was money
owed to me?

339
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:14,958
I knew.

340
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:19,708
Bring him in.
- Okay, brother.

341
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:24,875
Come on.

342
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:27,667
Drag him.

343
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,125
He borrowed money
for a premium interest.

344
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,375
He didn't repay it on time.

345
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,458
I've locked him in my warehouse
for three days now.

346
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,250
Four of my boys...
- Please save me.

347
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:47,542
They're practicing their punches on him
all day.

348
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:48,833
Take your hands off me.

349
00:23:49,417 --> 00:23:51,167
They just don't hit him here.

350
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:52,583
Ask me why!

351
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,917
Why?

352
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:59,542
In another 3 days, I'll cut him open
and sell both his kidneys.

353
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,375
Since I know you guys well,

354
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,833
I'll give you one week's time.
- Please show mercy.

355
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:08,000
8 lakhs, with interest for 7 days.

356
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:11,833
I need 9 lakhs on my table!

357
00:24:13,167 --> 00:24:14,583
Or else...

358
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,417
I’ll kidnap this guy!

359
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:24,750
You lost the money,
but I'm going to lose my kidneys?

360
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:26,333
Get an ATM machine ready.

361
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:30,083
If we need to raise 9 lakhs,
we need to make 7 machines.

362
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:32,875
We need to find 7 dimwits.
I don't see that happening.

363
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:36,833
We don't have another option.

364
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:40,375
Meet the lathe workshop guy tomorrow,
and get the ATM machines ready.

365
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,167
Did you meet the lathe guy?

366
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:25,125
He screwed us over.

367
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:27,958
He will start work only if we
pay him a lakh upfront.

368
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,667
I've given him so much business!

369
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:36,750
I used stronger expletives.
He wants to see the money.

370
00:25:37,417 --> 00:25:38,542
I'm going to...

371
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:40,083
He won't do it
even if you beat him up.

372
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,375
Want some tea?

373
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:45,750
Buzz off.

374
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:49,583
We need a lakh to take
even one step forward.

375
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:51,208
That's the situation now!

376
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,792
I stashed that money under old sacks
just so you won’t see it...

377
00:25:55,042 --> 00:25:56,875
But you somehow found it,
and lost it!

378
00:25:59,542 --> 00:26:00,750
How much do we have now?

379
00:26:03,417 --> 00:26:04,917
One, two, three, four, five...

380
00:26:04,958 --> 00:26:06,792
six, seven, eight, nine and ten.

381
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:09,250
There’s another 10 on my feet!

382
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:11,333
Just buzz off.

383
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:14,333
I don’t have money even for a cup of tea,
and you’re asking me?

384
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:20,667
Kavin?

385
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:23,167
Hi!

386
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:29,125
Why is she smiling like that?

387
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:33,292
Who is that?

388
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:36,667
She even knows your name.

389
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,958
Auntie said you're coming only tomorrow.

390
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:42,583
Auntie?
- Even she reacts the same way.

391
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:45,208
She asks me to call her 'mother' instead.

392
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:47,333
I'll get used to it soon.

393
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:48,792
She means your mother!

394
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:50,250
But you said your mom died.

395
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:53,833
I saw in the news that
it’s raining heavily in Kolkata.

396
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:56,542
I've been visiting temples
these last 3 days...

397
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:59,458
praying that there shouldn't be any rain
when you're piloting flights.

398
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:05,417
Pilot? Flights?

399
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,042
I'm learning Bengali.

400
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:12,542
By the time we get married
and move to Kolkata...

401
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:14,542
I think I'll be able to converse fluently.

402
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:17,083
By the time you learn Bengali,
he’ll vanish!

403
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:21,250
Who are you?!

404
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:23,667
Why are you so aggressive?

405
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:27,458
Actually, I came here to
withdraw cash for auntie's treatment.

406
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:29,625
I can withdraw from my bank
only at 10:30.

407
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,250
She wanted 1.5 lakhs
for her treatment.

408
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:35,458
But I only had 1 lakh
in my account.

409
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:42,250
Should I give this cash to you,
or wait till auntie is here?

410
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:46,875
Dude, random men are hitting me!

411
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:48,625
I have no clue why.

412
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,250
I am having a bad time.

413
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:52,167
Don't let go of this chance,
just grab it.

414
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:53,958
Come here.
- Wait, I'm coming!

415
00:27:54,042 --> 00:27:57,000
I don't know what to say,
I feel so nervous.

416
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:00,542
Auntie is here.
She just messaged me.

417
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:03,792
She is waiting around the corner.
Shall we go?

418
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:06,250
You go ahead.
I'll follow.

419
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:11,042
Come, let's go see your mother.

420
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,917
Auntie!

421
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,000
Kavin... your mother!

422
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,000
I didn't think
I'd be running into him here.

423
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:36,250
She didn't think so either!
Right, mom?

424
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:37,375
Auntie...

425
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:40,542
No need for that.
You take leave.

426
00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:42,583
I'm here now.

427
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,250
I'll be with mom, and take
care of her treatment.

428
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,833
She works at a cell phone shop.

429
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:50,000
We met while we shared a cab.

430
00:28:50,417 --> 00:28:52,250
Her parents were looking for a groom.

431
00:28:52,417 --> 00:28:56,625
I said I'm looking for a bride for my son,
who works as a pilot in Kolkata.

432
00:28:56,792 --> 00:28:58,875
Is it wrong to make use of
an opportunity that knocks on my door?

433
00:28:58,958 --> 00:29:01,958
You make use of whatever opportunity you get!
Why did you use my photo?

434
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,250
You expect me to show his photo?
She'd have fled in an instant!

435
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:07,875
I've been working on
this for three months.

436
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:10,875
All my hard work has gone to waste.

437
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:12,750
Hello?
- How is auntie doing?

438
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:15,208
Did you give her my number?

439
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:17,708
You haven’t changed that number yet?

440
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:19,500
You usually change your
number every two months!

441
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,875
I told dad that she isn't feeling well.

442
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:25,750
He asked if we can visit.

443
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:26,958
Not now...

444
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:28,542
She's in the ICU.

445
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:30,542
Oh no...

446
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:32,292
Nothing to worry about.

447
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,917
I'll call you when she gets discharged.
Okay?

448
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,875
When I saw your photo,
I liked you right away.

449
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,917
But I was a little scared
that you might not like me.

450
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:47,208
If that girl crosses my line again...

451
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:49,333
you're dead.

452
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,000
Hello?

453
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:53,208
Hello?

454
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,750
He hung up!

455
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:57,917
Why did you refuse money
that came our way?

456
00:29:57,958 --> 00:29:59,750
Did we ask for it?
- Stop it!

457
00:29:59,792 --> 00:30:02,417
Are you mad?
- She came with the money on her own!

458
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:05,250
I'm going to beat you to death.

459
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:09,125
How are we going to repay Dass?
We were getting 1 lakh in a platter!

460
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:16,083
Look at yourself!

461
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:20,250
She works in a cell phone shop.
How much do you think she earns?

462
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:22,208
Her dad is a security guard
at a garment shop.

463
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,000
So what?

464
00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:24,542
We'll find a way.
Let go.

465
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:26,333
What?
Let go?

466
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,250
He's scratched me all over!

467
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:32,208
Did you just say
"Let go"?

468
00:30:32,417 --> 00:30:34,958
Suruli...
- Take your hands off me.

469
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,958
Easy for you to say.
- Where are you going?

470
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,417
Your kidneys are safe!
- Come on!

471
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,833
Suruli...

472
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:43,333
Your kidneys are safe, right?

473
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,125
Dude, wait up!

474
00:30:52,792 --> 00:30:55,167
I'm leaving for Pondicherry early morning,
with my friends.

475
00:30:56,042 --> 00:30:58,750
You already told me.
- Another girl, and three guys.

476
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:01,125
I'll be back only on Monday.

477
00:31:01,917 --> 00:31:03,583
You have no problem with that, right?

478
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:07,917
Three guys?
What is this!

479
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,417
She was born in Dubai,
 and grew up in Delhi.

480
00:31:10,917 --> 00:31:13,875
If I make a fuss about this,
she'd think I'm uncool.

481
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,000
I need to show her
I'm hep!

482
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,875
But we aren't hep!

483
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,417
Now look at you!
You're burning with jealousy.

484
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:23,792
One of those guys
is mad about me.

485
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:26,750
He sends me flirty messages
every day.

486
00:31:27,542 --> 00:31:29,625
He is a tall, rich guy.

487
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:31,375
Looks real smart.

488
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:35,208
I think he just messaged me.

489
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:01,333
This is so you don't forget whose girl you are
till you return from Pondy.

490
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:22,458
'My pair! My soul mate!
The blink of your eyes, makes me freeze.'

491
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:33,083
'My beautiful! My precious!
With you, my world begins and ends.'

492
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:43,167
'When you are around,
My phone turns speechless.'

493
00:32:43,542 --> 00:32:53,500
'When you tilt your head and smile,
My tea tastes a lot sweeter.'

494
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:04,208
'My pair! My soul mate!
Your sweetness makes me melt.'

495
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:14,792
'When we walk with clasped fingers,
For ages that sensation lingers.'

496
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:18,292
'My pair!'

497
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:46,792
'My heart wonders, when I think...
At what point did infatuation become love?'

498
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:56,792
'My heart is panting, when I think...
Of the point our love turns to lust'

499
00:33:56,958 --> 00:34:06,917
'On some days you clean my body,
With the sweet sweat from your body.'

500
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:16,625
'Once you are pleased with my services,
You gave me back my clothes.'

501
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:19,667
I quit my job.

502
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:21,500
Why?

503
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:24,250
Try watching six movies every week
and reviewing them...

504
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:25,333
you'll see why.

505
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:30,125
He proposed marriage.
I said yes.

506
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:31,667
When?

507
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:33,875
After I return from Delhi.

508
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:41,875
I'm going to Delhi first.
For my friend's reception.

509
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:45,250
College reunion after that.
Then, North India tour.

510
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,417
I will be away for 20 days.

511
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,333
You told me.

512
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:51,083
Fool!

513
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:54,083
What?

514
00:34:54,417 --> 00:34:57,167
Don’t you want me to remember
whose girl I am?

515
00:34:57,542 --> 00:35:07,958
'My pair! My soul mate!
Your sweetness makes me melt.'

516
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:18,667
'When we walk with clasped fingers,
For ages that sensation lingers.'

517
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:28,500
'When you are around,
My phone turns speechless.'

518
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:39,208
'When you tilt your head and smile,
My tea tastes a lot sweeter.'

519
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:49,500
'My pair! My soul mate!
Your sweetness makes me melt.'

520
00:35:49,625 --> 00:36:00,375
'When we walk with clasped fingers,
For ages that sensation lingers.'

521
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:02,292
'My soul mate!'

522
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:18,042
Please pull over.

523
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:47,083
The money isn't due
for another 2 days.

524
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,833
What did you do
these 4 days?

525
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:51,625
You can't do squat in another 2 days.

526
00:36:57,042 --> 00:36:58,292
So... Kavin?

527
00:36:58,792 --> 00:37:01,083
Where is Suruli?
- In my warehouse.

528
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:03,708
You need to settle the account
before dawn.

529
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:05,500
I won't accept part payment.

530
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:07,583
You have one day's time.
- Heard that?

531
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,917
Then, I'll cut him open
and sell him part by part.

532
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:23,292
Thanks guys.
Toast to all.

533
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:27,583
Thank you! Enjoy.
Couldn't have done this without you all.

534
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:32,000
Thanks, guys.
Thank you.

535
00:37:36,917 --> 00:37:38,833
What's this party for?

536
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:42,208
The construction isn't complete,
but all units have been sold already.

537
00:37:43,458 --> 00:37:45,667
Thank you, guys.

538
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,250
Have fun, everybody.

539
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:49,458
Buddy, I need some money urgently.

540
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:52,083
You could have asked me last week!

541
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:54,417
Business has been terrible these
 last 2 months.

542
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:55,917
Why don't you ask Annachi?

543
00:37:56,042 --> 00:37:57,417
Do you have any surety?

544
00:37:57,958 --> 00:37:59,417
Give me a week's time, buddy.

545
00:37:59,792 --> 00:38:01,292
You're in trouble with Dass?

546
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:03,583
No one will give you any money.

547
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:15,167
What is it, girl?
You haven't touched your food!

548
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:18,542
I'll tell you something
if you promise not to tell dad.

549
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:19,625
What?

550
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:22,792
You know auntie, right?
Kavin's mom...

551
00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:25,583
She isn't Kavin's mom.

552
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:28,417
She is basically a fraud.

553
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:31,875
The entire group!

554
00:38:33,417 --> 00:38:35,583
Everything they told us is a lie.

555
00:38:38,542 --> 00:38:39,875
What do you mean?

556
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:42,458
The money she asked
for her treatment...

557
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:44,458
If we had given that money...

558
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,583
we'd have lost it all.

559
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:48,542
Shall we go to the police?

560
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:51,875
But Kavin didn't take the money.

561
00:38:52,792 --> 00:38:54,708
He could have taken it
if he'd wanted to.

562
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:58,208
That means he is a good guy, right?

563
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,333
Who could it be at this time?

564
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:12,208
My mom's condition
has suddenly worsened.

565
00:39:13,542 --> 00:39:15,375
They need to perform
 a surgery right away.

566
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:17,542
I need some money immediately.

567
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:35,750
All my money is in fixed deposits
and bonds.

568
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:37,875
I couldn't liquidate it
in such short notice.

569
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:40,250
Do you have any money
with you now?

570
00:39:41,042 --> 00:39:43,083
I'll return it next week.

571
00:39:58,583 --> 00:39:59,708
What is it?

572
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,875
Nothing.

573
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,250
It's okay, baby.

574
00:40:07,792 --> 00:40:11,125
It's alright, baby.

575
00:40:12,417 --> 00:40:13,375
Thanks.

576
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:18,917
Shall I have a word
with your father?

577
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,667
He is working night shift.

578
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:22,875
Anyway, this is money I earned.

579
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:26,083
I saved it up for my dowry.
You don't need to ask him.

580
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:35,083
I'll call you in the morning.

581
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:41,083
Kavin...

582
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,750
Do you know my name?

583
00:41:06,792 --> 00:41:07,625
Sorry...

584
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:10,292
How is the party? Are you enjoying?
- Sorry, excuse me.

585
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:11,917
Excuse...

586
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:15,750
Buddy, I'm off.
- How can you leave your own party?

587
00:41:15,792 --> 00:41:18,083
I need to be at the land registration
office tomorrow morning.

588
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:19,875
Okay, you take care.
- Bye bye.

589
00:41:19,917 --> 00:41:22,000
Okay, guys. Bye.
- Bye.

590
00:41:22,417 --> 00:41:23,375
Have fun!

591
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:10,792
'KAVIN'

592
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:35,667
'EZHIL'

593
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:52,625
So arrogant.

594
00:46:52,667 --> 00:46:54,458
Always throwing the rule book
in our faces.

595
00:46:54,708 --> 00:46:57,167
Do you know why she got transferred?
- I don't know.

596
00:46:57,208 --> 00:46:59,875
She helped a culprit
in her previous posting.

597
00:46:59,958 --> 00:47:02,125
Really?
- She almost lost her job...

598
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:04,583
She got a three month suspension..
- She deserves it!

599
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:05,833
Everybody, out.

600
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:08,708
What sort of training did you get?
- She's here!

601
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:10,917
Sorry, madam.
- Don't contaminate the crime scene!

602
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Yes, madam.

603
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:14,083
Sir...

604
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:16,292
Sir!

605
00:47:26,667 --> 00:47:28,833
Who informed us?
- The house maid.

606
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:31,167
She was out of town
and returned only this morning.

607
00:47:34,042 --> 00:47:36,875
The killer has put the body in the tub,
and turned the tap on.

608
00:47:36,917 --> 00:47:38,625
The maid was the one
who closed it.

609
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:40,667
I don't know if we'll find any evidence.

610
00:47:40,833 --> 00:47:42,750
So the culprit has forensic knowledge?

611
00:47:50,458 --> 00:47:51,792
Did you find the murder weapon?

612
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:53,833
I looked for it
but couldn't find it.

613
00:47:53,958 --> 00:47:55,500
It doesn't look like a
knife wound.

614
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:03,583
It's something else.

615
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:18,333
Point of entry, sir.

616
00:48:24,667 --> 00:48:26,833
The murder should have
taken place at this point, sir.

617
00:48:30,583 --> 00:48:31,958
The victim's name is Akash.

618
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:34,208
He doesn't have a mother.
His father lives in America.

619
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:38,750
As if we didn't have enough
of a workload already...

620
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:44,167
Look for a good restaurant
and get some nice coffee.

621
00:48:44,208 --> 00:48:45,208
Okay, sir.

622
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,083
Malar, you handle this case.

623
00:48:47,667 --> 00:48:49,667
First, inform Akash's dad.

624
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:52,542
See if Akash has any relatives locally.

625
00:48:55,417 --> 00:48:56,667
It’s my younger brother.

626
00:49:01,375 --> 00:49:03,542
See if there is any money
or valuables missing.

627
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:15,167
He always has money at home.
But it's not there now.

628
00:49:22,667 --> 00:49:23,917
How did you arrange the money?

629
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:26,792
How does it matter to you?
You got your money.

630
00:49:27,625 --> 00:49:28,667
Release Suruli.

631
00:49:29,125 --> 00:49:31,375
Doesn't look like you got the money
through the trade...

632
00:49:31,417 --> 00:49:32,542
So I wondered...

633
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:35,208
9 lakhs in one night...

634
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:37,208
Even I can't manage that!

635
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:39,417
Go!

636
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:43,292
Move your leg.

637
00:49:54,417 --> 00:49:55,667
Why did you give me the money?

638
00:49:57,667 --> 00:49:59,542
You knew I was lying.

639
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:03,333
But you still gave me the money.

640
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:04,375
Why?

641
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:07,500
What if I had just taken
the money and left with it?

642
00:50:12,917 --> 00:50:16,542
If you had just left with it,
I'd have found it easy to forget you.

643
00:50:20,208 --> 00:50:22,208
You'd have found it difficult
to forget me.

644
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:33,375
The inspector isn't interested
in Akash's case.

645
00:50:33,583 --> 00:50:36,708
Let me be frank, madam.
We've been doing the rounds for 3 days...

646
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:39,458
This case has reached a dead end!

647
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:41,750
We have no witness or evidence.

648
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:44,542
I don't believe we'd see any progress.

649
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,833
You're the one hanging on to it.

650
00:50:46,917 --> 00:50:49,042
Come to the station after the enquiry.
- Okay.

651
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,208
This house was locked that night.

652
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:54,375
The security guard says he got drunk
and passed out. He didn't see anything.

653
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:56,000
Did you ask around
the entire stretch?

654
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:57,083
I did, madam.

655
00:50:57,125 --> 00:50:58,333
Most of the houses
are unoccupied.

656
00:50:58,417 --> 00:51:00,292
People come here only during
some festival or holiday.

657
00:51:02,417 --> 00:51:05,000
There are people who don't
even own a single house...

658
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:09,750
And these people have built such big houses
to party once every year!

659
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:11,167
Stupid rich men.

660
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:13,042
Get in the jeep.
- Yes.

661
00:51:13,542 --> 00:51:15,667
Let's check the street behind us.
- Okay, madam.

662
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,833
Give it.
- All the details are here.

663
00:51:21,208 --> 00:51:22,042
Sir...

664
00:51:22,208 --> 00:51:23,917
Malar wants to see you.

665
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:25,167
I'm talking here!

666
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,958
She says it's urgent.
I already made her wait for half an hour.

667
00:51:31,417 --> 00:51:32,833
What?
- Sir!

668
00:51:33,208 --> 00:51:36,125
Sir, I’ve been enquiring in Akash’s locality
for the last three days.

669
00:51:36,583 --> 00:51:39,083
There was a party in the house
behind the murder site that night.

670
00:51:43,458 --> 00:51:45,042
The house owner is from Coimbatore.

671
00:51:45,458 --> 00:51:47,000
His son hosted the party.

672
00:51:47,792 --> 00:51:50,125
I have traced him and asked him
to come from Coimbatore.

673
00:51:50,417 --> 00:51:51,292
He is outside.

674
00:51:51,417 --> 00:51:54,167
Come to the point!
- Sir, this is his cell phone.

675
00:51:54,292 --> 00:51:57,000
This is a selfie he took with
his girlfriend from his balcony.

676
00:52:00,167 --> 00:52:02,208
The timeframe matches with the
timeframe of the murder.

677
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:05,125
Sir, zoom into it
and look at the left side.

678
00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:20,125
I know this fellow!

679
00:52:21,292 --> 00:52:23,542
His name is Ezhil.
Former IIT student.

680
00:52:32,417 --> 00:52:34,875
Forward this picture to all stations
through hue and cry.

681
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:36,792
Find his current address.

682
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:40,375
Set aside all other work,
and concentrate on this case.

683
00:52:40,583 --> 00:52:41,500
Yes, sir.

684
00:52:47,458 --> 00:52:48,833
You're dead!

685
00:52:52,667 --> 00:52:53,667
Mr. Ezhil?

686
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,333
Hello?
Can you hear me?

687
00:53:04,417 --> 00:53:06,542
Hello?
Anyone out there?

688
00:53:46,542 --> 00:53:47,833
What do you want, sir?

689
00:53:49,875 --> 00:53:52,917
I've been locked up since 10 am.
They've taken away my phone, too.

690
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,667
They're not giving any reasons, either.

691
00:53:54,958 --> 00:53:57,042
We asked him to eat
but he refused.

692
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,083
What's your problem with Akash?

693
00:54:01,625 --> 00:54:03,417
Akash who?
- C.S. Akash.

694
00:54:03,542 --> 00:54:05,458
3rd Cross Street, Neelangarai.

695
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:08,208
I don't know any such person.

696
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,417
What's happening here?

697
00:54:16,042 --> 00:54:18,292
They said they wanted to talk
about some case for 10 minutes--

698
00:54:18,333 --> 00:54:21,167
Where were you last Sunday night?

699
00:54:24,625 --> 00:54:26,792
I was in my office.
At a party.

700
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,167
You left your own party midway.

701
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,958
What was the hurry?

702
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:36,375
I need to be at the land registration
office tomorrow morning.

703
00:54:36,417 --> 00:54:37,708
You take care.
Bye.

704
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:40,250
No particular reason.

705
00:54:40,958 --> 00:54:42,042
I had a headache.

706
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:43,208
A headache?

707
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:47,792
Didn't you leave early saying
you had a land registration in the morning?

708
00:54:49,042 --> 00:54:51,792
But you never went to the
registration office on Monday.

709
00:54:57,125 --> 00:54:58,125
We’ve enquired.

710
00:55:01,167 --> 00:55:02,375
Did you lie?

711
00:55:04,208 --> 00:55:06,833
Sir, you’re trying to frame me
because we have a history.

712
00:55:19,125 --> 00:55:20,208
What did you say?

713
00:55:39,958 --> 00:55:40,958
Get up.

714
00:55:48,792 --> 00:55:52,292
Last Sunday, you left your office
at 10:30 pm.

715
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,333
You can reach your home
 in 20 minutes.

716
00:55:56,042 --> 00:55:58,500
But you came home only by 3 am.
Where were you?

717
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:02,417
My car had a puncture on the way.
- Where?

718
00:56:03,042 --> 00:56:04,792
Natesan Street, Little Mount.

719
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:13,042
Does it take 3 hours
to fix a tyre?

720
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:14,875
Half an hour sir, at the most.

721
00:56:15,792 --> 00:56:17,000
I didn't have a car jack.

722
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:19,500
I had to ask around for help.

723
00:56:20,625 --> 00:56:22,792
A cabbie drove past me,
but didn't stop.

724
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:25,083
A couple of cars stopped.

725
00:56:26,208 --> 00:56:27,542
But they didn't have a jack.

726
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,833
Finally, a call taxi guy came.

727
00:56:35,958 --> 00:56:37,167
He helped me.

728
00:56:44,542 --> 00:56:45,708
What call taxi?

729
00:56:47,333 --> 00:56:48,250
I didn't notice.

730
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:50,208
Registration number?
- I don't know.

731
00:56:50,458 --> 00:56:52,083
You don't know which call taxi...

732
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:54,375
You didn't notice the registration
number either...

733
00:56:54,625 --> 00:56:57,667
Suddenly a Good Samaritan turned up,
helped you and left?

734
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,000
Lift him up.

735
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:08,625
Akash died last Sunday.

736
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:09,750
He was killed.

737
00:57:10,625 --> 00:57:13,958
Someone stabbed his neck repeatedly
with a sharp object.

738
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:16,958
Why are you telling me
all this?

739
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,625
You neither knew Akash...

740
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:21,292
nor went to 3rd Cross St.
Correct?

741
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:28,458
This is a picture of you
in his balcony that night.

742
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:39,833
This evidence is sufficient.

743
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:41,500
Out.

744
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,875
Forget your future, business,
and everything else.

745
00:57:51,458 --> 00:57:53,042
Your life is done.

746
00:57:54,792 --> 00:57:56,792
I'm going to bury you.

747
00:58:04,792 --> 00:58:06,667
The inspector is trying to frame me.

748
00:58:07,292 --> 00:58:08,417
I'm innocent.

749
00:58:09,708 --> 00:58:11,458
We have previous enmity.

750
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:14,458
Give me my phone.
I need to talk to my lawyer.

751
00:58:15,083 --> 00:58:17,292
There is a problem, sir.
- What?

752
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:50,125
He was caught for drunken driving.

753
00:58:50,208 --> 00:58:53,750
The Vyasarpadi station inspector sent him
after seeing the photo we circulated.

754
00:58:57,792 --> 00:58:58,958
He is sloshed.

755
00:58:59,917 --> 00:59:01,542
He can't even say his name.

756
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:04,167
He got drunk and ran his motorcycle
into the police jeep.

757
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:08,208
Bring him to the store room.

758
00:59:11,375 --> 00:59:13,250
Where were you on the night
of the 2nd?

759
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,542
I don't remember.

760
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:31,167
If you beat me up like this,
I will forget where I was this morning!

761
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:46,583
Sir...

762
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:50,333
You had chicken biriyani and
prawn fry for lunch. Correct?

763
00:59:50,583 --> 00:59:52,625
Buy me one chicken biriyani
and one prawn fry.

764
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,167
Sir, my friend wasn't feeling well
on that day.

765
00:59:58,333 --> 00:59:59,917
I spent the entire day with him.

766
01:00:00,167 --> 01:00:02,375
I got him medicines and food.

767
01:00:02,542 --> 01:00:04,333
I went home at night and slept.

768
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:06,125
Your friend's name?
- Suruli.

769
01:00:06,417 --> 01:00:07,833
He has a shop at Ricky Street.

770
01:00:31,958 --> 01:00:34,583
You continue.
Note down his friend's address.

771
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:37,375
The inspector is here.
Step aside.

772
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,708
Give the phone to the PP.

773
01:00:47,917 --> 01:00:50,208
Srini, can you come over
to the station?

774
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,042
It's urgent.

775
01:00:52,417 --> 01:00:57,292
24/12, Nehru Nagar,
Vyasarpadi, Chennai.

776
01:00:57,542 --> 01:00:59,708
Look guys, he's got a ladies' hankie!

777
01:01:00,333 --> 01:01:02,583
You were acting so cocky...

778
01:01:02,667 --> 01:01:04,583
Aren't you ashamed
to have a ladies' hankie?

779
01:01:06,542 --> 01:01:08,792
What other lady things do you have?

780
01:01:08,917 --> 01:01:10,708
Check him properly, sir.

781
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:14,042
He might have things like
lipstick, hairpin, rubber band etc.

782
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:17,083
Look at him staring!
Should I beat him up some more?

783
01:01:20,708 --> 01:01:21,833
Sorry, madam.

784
01:01:23,292 --> 01:01:24,875
He's crashed into
a police vehicle, sir!

785
01:01:24,917 --> 01:01:26,292
You get drunk and--

786
01:01:38,583 --> 01:01:39,500
Madam.

787
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,208
Was that yours?

788
01:01:47,917 --> 01:01:51,292
Gowrishankar Sharma vs State of UP, 1990.

789
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:53,125
Sir, he is talking about some Gowri.

790
01:01:53,333 --> 01:01:55,167
Who is Gowri?
- Head constable...

791
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:59,083
Gowrishankar Sharma vs State.
He is talking about some judgment.

792
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:00,917
Judgment?

793
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:03,042
What about the judgment?

794
01:02:03,667 --> 01:02:08,792
Any form of torture, cruel, inhuman
or degrading treatment is prohibited.

795
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:10,792
What is he saying, sir?

796
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:12,833
It is a crime to hit a suspect.

797
01:02:13,833 --> 01:02:15,250
Not just hitting.

798
01:02:15,667 --> 01:02:18,875
Even mistreating a suspect in any way
 is a crime.

799
01:02:20,583 --> 01:02:21,958
Haven't you read the judgment?

800
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:23,125
How arrogant!

801
01:02:24,792 --> 01:02:27,250
Prithipal Singh vs State of Punjab.

802
01:02:28,542 --> 01:02:32,417
The court suspended the entire police station
for hitting a suspect.

803
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:35,833
The ones who hit, the ones who
watched on... everyone!

804
01:02:38,583 --> 01:02:39,958
Is he a lawyer?

805
01:02:40,667 --> 01:02:42,625
Iyappan, hit him in such a way
the bruises don’t show!

806
01:02:43,083 --> 01:02:46,542
The court gave an eight year sentence
to the constable who instigated the torture.

807
01:02:47,708 --> 01:02:49,083
Rigorous imprisonment.

808
01:02:49,708 --> 01:02:52,458
You don't know about
Rahigit Singh vs State of Haryana?

809
01:02:53,958 --> 01:02:58,208
The head constable is in the same prison
as the convicts he put behind bars.

810
01:02:58,417 --> 01:02:59,583
To this day.

811
01:03:00,625 --> 01:03:03,292
The police constable who beat the
suspect is also in the same jail.

812
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:18,375
Dhanapal, you hit him.

813
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:24,125
What now, madam?

814
01:03:24,417 --> 01:03:27,083
I sprained my hand.
Or I'd have thrashed him!

815
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:29,833
Let's wait for the inspector.

816
01:03:44,583 --> 01:03:45,458
Sir!

817
01:03:51,667 --> 01:03:52,708
Lock him up in the cell.

818
01:03:54,542 --> 01:03:56,167
Srini...
- Go in.

819
01:03:57,167 --> 01:03:58,500
Lock it.
- Okay, sir.

820
01:04:14,667 --> 01:04:17,083
They look like photocopies of each other!

821
01:04:17,792 --> 01:04:19,250
This is the only evidence.

822
01:04:20,208 --> 01:04:21,917
This evidence is a total waste now.

823
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,167
Have you booked Ezhil?
- I have brought him in for questioning.

824
01:04:25,458 --> 01:04:27,917
You can't keep Ezhil locked
up like this, GK.

825
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:28,625
Why?

826
01:04:28,667 --> 01:04:31,583
He runs a construction company.
He must have contacts.

827
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,583
I got you here hoping
you'd give me some useful advice.

828
01:04:36,333 --> 01:04:38,708
Srini, I'm retiring next month.

829
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,917
I won't get a better chance
to take down this guy.

830
01:04:44,042 --> 01:04:47,583
GK, I know that you two
have a problem with each other.

831
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:51,167
I'm talking as your friend,
and also as the Public Prosecutor.

832
01:04:51,708 --> 01:04:54,375
The problem is, we have another
guy who looks just like Ezhil.

833
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:58,833
That too, he got caught
at another station.

834
01:04:59,042 --> 01:05:03,167
From his arrest to his handover to you,
everything will be on record.

835
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:07,375
If it wasn't for that,
we could have killed Kavin...

836
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,417
and closed the case,
claiming Ezhil to be the man in the selfie.

837
01:05:25,292 --> 01:05:27,792
What are my options now?
Tell me that!

838
01:05:28,417 --> 01:05:31,375
Did one of these two commit the murder?
- Without a doubt.

839
01:05:31,708 --> 01:05:34,667
Is there a chance that a third person
did it, and not these two?

840
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:36,333
Not a chance.

841
01:05:41,833 --> 01:05:43,667
Then one of them is lying.

842
01:05:50,792 --> 01:05:53,042
State in your records
that you booked Ezhil on Sunday.

843
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:55,542
Today is Friday.
We have 2 days.

844
01:05:55,917 --> 01:05:58,042
We need to produce them at court
on Monday.

845
01:05:58,292 --> 01:06:01,458
Before that, find out which of them
is in that selfie.

846
01:06:21,667 --> 01:06:24,917
'EIGHT MONTHS LATER'

847
01:06:30,917 --> 01:06:31,708
Hello, sir.

848
01:06:32,375 --> 01:06:34,917
We're making a documentary
about Akash's case.

849
01:06:34,958 --> 01:06:36,542
We want to interview you.

850
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:45,333
My face won't be seen, right?

851
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:47,167
No, sir.
We will blur it out.

852
01:06:47,875 --> 01:06:50,208
Initially, the investigation was slow.

853
01:06:51,042 --> 01:06:54,375
But eventually, the full team really
got into the case.

854
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:56,958
We didn't leave out any information.

855
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,083
For two full days...

856
01:06:58,583 --> 01:07:01,083
we worked day and night.
None of us got any sleep.

857
01:07:01,958 --> 01:07:03,292
Give me some water.
- Here, sir.

858
01:07:06,458 --> 01:07:07,250
Ready!

859
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:09,042
The inspector was pushing
us towards one direction...

860
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:11,167
The sub-inspector madam
was pushing us in another direction.

861
01:07:11,208 --> 01:07:13,750
The whole station was shaken up
those two days.

862
01:07:14,417 --> 01:07:17,083
'EIGHT MONTHS BACK'

863
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:19,500
'DAY 1'

864
01:07:20,208 --> 01:07:22,375
We need to produce them at court
on Monday.

865
01:07:22,917 --> 01:07:24,917
So, we only have 2 days...

866
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:27,958
to find out if this is Ezhil or Kavin.

867
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:34,167
Till they admit the truth, don't give
them any food. Just water.

868
01:07:34,667 --> 01:07:35,875
And more importantly...

869
01:07:36,625 --> 01:07:40,667
Ezhil shouldn't know that we have
another suspect in our custody.

870
01:07:40,958 --> 01:07:44,583
Similarly, Kavin shouldn't know that
we have Ezhil under custody.

871
01:07:45,167 --> 01:07:48,083
Both of them must think
that they're the only suspect.

872
01:07:48,167 --> 01:07:49,500
Got it?
- Yes, sir.

873
01:07:49,542 --> 01:07:50,542
Strip.

874
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:53,458
I said, strip!

875
01:08:01,792 --> 01:08:02,792
What's that wound?

876
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:10,917
I got hurt at the construction site.

877
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:23,750
Strip.

878
01:08:26,958 --> 01:08:29,333
Stop it, man.
I meant your shirt.

879
01:08:39,542 --> 01:08:40,500
What's this?

880
01:08:46,042 --> 01:08:47,417
My bike skid off and I fell.

881
01:09:01,625 --> 01:09:03,708
'EZHIL'

882
01:09:09,042 --> 01:09:11,542
'KAVIN'

883
01:09:12,167 --> 01:09:15,083
We beat up both of them.
Even gave them an electric shock.

884
01:09:15,667 --> 01:09:17,625
They're saying the same thing
over and over again.

885
01:09:18,333 --> 01:09:20,333
One of them is
playing us.

886
01:09:20,958 --> 01:09:22,333
We need to find out who.

887
01:09:22,375 --> 01:09:24,667
We only have that selfie
as evidence.

888
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,750
Even that's useless now.

889
01:09:26,792 --> 01:09:29,500
I don't have a clue
how to take the next step.

890
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:31,083
Let's dig into Akash's history.

891
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:32,750
The answer must lie there.

892
01:09:33,042 --> 01:09:36,208
Let's gather all the information we can -
 his friends, hobbies etc.

893
01:09:36,583 --> 01:09:39,833
If we find out who Akash is,
we can find out who his killer is.

894
01:09:43,167 --> 01:09:46,500
He mostly stayed at home.
He rarely went out.

895
01:09:46,708 --> 01:09:48,042
He played video games.

896
01:09:48,167 --> 01:09:49,458
He played his guitar.

897
01:09:50,917 --> 01:09:52,833
He used to browse the internet
for hours together.

898
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:57,875
They say you were Akash's best friend.

899
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:02,083
We played in the same rock band
in college.

900
01:10:02,292 --> 01:10:05,042
After he went to the US,
we slowly lost touch.

901
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,167
Why did he return?

902
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,458
He said he didn't like the US.

903
01:10:09,708 --> 01:10:13,542
He didn't have to earn.
His dad sends him money every month.

904
01:10:14,042 --> 01:10:15,250
He was a good man.

905
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:19,542
When my son had typhoid in February,
he took care of the expenses.

906
01:10:19,708 --> 01:10:21,500
He refused to deduct
it from my salary, too.

907
01:10:24,208 --> 01:10:26,125
Akash didn't have a circle of friends.

908
01:10:26,542 --> 01:10:29,542
He was the only friend Akash had,
that too during college.

909
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:32,875
Did he have a girlfriend?

910
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:36,542
He was a little awkward with girls.

911
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:39,250
There was some talk that he loved
a girl during school.

912
01:10:39,833 --> 01:10:41,500
But the girl apparently ignored him.

913
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:44,042
I think his confidence
took a big hit after that.

914
01:10:45,083 --> 01:10:47,250
He didn’t show any interest
towards girls.

915
01:10:47,833 --> 01:10:51,083
His world was just music and computers.

916
01:10:52,167 --> 01:10:53,333
Do you recognize him?

917
01:10:55,667 --> 01:10:56,667
No, sir.

918
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:58,292
Do you know him?

919
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:04,542
No.

920
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:08,208
I was down with fever on the 2nd.

921
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:10,750
Kavin got me tablets and food.

922
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,583
He left at 11 pm.

923
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:14,583
Basically they're both frauds.

924
01:11:15,083 --> 01:11:16,583
But they don't operate in the city.

925
01:11:16,917 --> 01:11:18,333
They do it in other places.

926
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:20,125
Any cases filed against them?

927
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:23,500
They mostly target Seths
who sell contraband.

928
01:11:23,667 --> 01:11:25,208
So none of them filed any complaints.

929
01:11:25,542 --> 01:11:27,458
His case dragged on for years...

930
01:11:27,792 --> 01:11:30,500
It was Kavin who found
some legal point and got him acquitted.

931
01:11:33,792 --> 01:11:35,750
How does he know so much
about the legal system?

932
01:11:40,167 --> 01:11:41,750
I won't do anything.
Tell me!

933
01:11:42,375 --> 01:11:45,417
He seems to know
 all the legal loop holes.

934
01:11:48,542 --> 01:11:50,542
You say he's only completed 12th grade.

935
01:11:53,417 --> 01:11:54,583
She's asking you.

936
01:11:54,833 --> 01:11:57,167
Where did he learn
how to bend the laws?

937
01:11:57,458 --> 01:11:59,542
He used to say
"If you hang out with the cops..."

938
01:11:59,583 --> 01:12:01,625
"you can learn a lot
about such stuff."

939
01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:09,292
Ezhil's life is pretty clear.

940
01:12:09,833 --> 01:12:12,625
He studied at IIT,
and worked as an engineer.

941
01:12:12,917 --> 01:12:15,125
Now he has his own
construction company.

942
01:12:15,375 --> 01:12:16,208
Go on.

943
01:12:16,542 --> 01:12:18,667
But I don't understand
Kavin's history.

944
01:12:19,208 --> 01:12:21,333
Suruli has known him
only for three years...

945
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:24,292
It's not clear what
he was doing before that.

946
01:12:25,583 --> 01:12:27,958
Get the other people who know Kavin.
- Okay, madam.

947
01:12:33,125 --> 01:12:34,375
Constable.
- Madam?

948
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:38,250
Be a little cautious when
you're enquiring about Ezhil.

949
01:12:39,208 --> 01:12:41,792
No one should know
he is under our custody.

950
01:12:43,083 --> 01:12:45,167
6:10 PM

951
01:12:45,917 --> 01:12:47,875
Did you check Ezhil and Kavin's
phone records?

952
01:12:48,375 --> 01:12:51,167
I did, madam. None of them have
any connection with Akash.

953
01:12:52,417 --> 01:12:54,250
Between Kavin and Ezhil?
- No, madam.

954
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:56,292
Kavin, Ezhil, and Akash...

955
01:12:56,375 --> 01:12:58,792
all three of them have
completely different circles.

956
01:12:58,917 --> 01:13:02,542
As far as I enquired, everyone
had only good things to say about Akash.

957
01:13:02,708 --> 01:13:04,625
Doesn't look like he had any weaknesses.

958
01:13:05,792 --> 01:13:08,917
Akash's sister mentioned he
always had cash at home, right?

959
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:09,917
Yes, madam.

960
01:13:10,542 --> 01:13:13,083
Get Akash's bank statement.
- Okay, madam.

961
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,375
You shouldn't leave town
without intimating us.

962
01:13:25,625 --> 01:13:26,625
Okay, madam.

963
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:52,542
There is cooked beans in the fridge.
Heat it up for dinner, dad.

964
01:13:54,167 --> 01:13:55,542
I'll be late tonight.

965
01:13:57,083 --> 01:13:57,958
Okay.

966
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:03,125
An entire day just flew by.
We only have one more day left.

967
01:14:03,458 --> 01:14:05,542
We're just going in circles.

968
01:14:06,417 --> 01:14:08,375
The case won't move
without additional evidence.

969
01:14:09,625 --> 01:14:11,708
We're missing something, constable.

970
01:14:12,292 --> 01:14:14,708
It's right in front of us,
but I don't know what it is.

971
01:14:20,208 --> 01:14:21,125
Constable?

972
01:14:32,708 --> 01:14:35,000
What does the inspector
have against Ezhil?

973
01:14:40,125 --> 01:14:43,625
The inspector's only daughter
was in love with a boy during college.

974
01:14:44,917 --> 01:14:46,708
That boy was from a
different caste.

975
01:14:46,792 --> 01:14:48,708
Our inspector is very
particular about that.

976
01:14:49,375 --> 01:14:52,458
When he heard about her love affair,
he found a groom from his community.

977
01:14:53,542 --> 01:14:56,458
The day before the wedding,
the girl eloped with her lover.

978
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,083
Till date, we don't know
where they are.

979
01:15:00,792 --> 01:15:02,042
Till date!

980
01:15:02,667 --> 01:15:06,458
The man who helped them at that time
was Ezhil.

981
01:15:07,208 --> 01:15:08,583
Why did Ezhil help them?

982
01:15:08,667 --> 01:15:12,542
All 3 of them were from the same college.
The boy and Ezhil were classmates.

983
01:15:13,042 --> 01:15:15,750
The inspector wanted to finish off Ezhil
back then…

984
01:15:16,375 --> 01:15:19,417
but he couldn't do anything
as Ezhil had strong contacts.

985
01:15:20,833 --> 01:15:24,208
Now he’s got a chance
to get back at him legally.

986
01:15:24,958 --> 01:15:26,125
He won't let it go.

987
01:15:33,875 --> 01:15:34,750
Hello?

988
01:15:34,958 --> 01:15:36,958
This is Bhagya from Forensics, madam.

989
01:15:38,292 --> 01:15:40,375
Forensics Bhagya...
 Who gave him my number?

990
01:15:41,583 --> 01:15:43,833
I gave it to him.
He asked for it...

991
01:15:45,417 --> 01:15:46,625
Tell me, sir.

992
01:15:47,458 --> 01:15:48,917
Akash's case is solved.

993
01:15:49,875 --> 01:15:50,792
What?

994
01:15:51,125 --> 01:15:53,292
Yes, madam.
Akash's case is solved.

995
01:15:56,125 --> 01:15:57,875
He says Akash's case is solved?

996
01:15:59,208 --> 01:16:02,625
We're breaking our heads here
without a clue...

997
01:16:03,167 --> 01:16:04,708
and you're saying
the case is solved?

998
01:16:04,792 --> 01:16:05,917
Before we get to that,

999
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,833
I've been meaning to ask you
this question for six months now.

1000
01:16:08,917 --> 01:16:09,833
What?

1001
01:16:10,417 --> 01:16:12,083
Give me an honest answer.

1002
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:14,958
Why did you turn me down
when I came to ask your hand in marriage?

1003
01:16:16,917 --> 01:16:19,083
Don't irritate me.
I'll hang up.

1004
01:16:19,667 --> 01:16:21,292
Okay, I'll get to the point.

1005
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:24,625
Our guys have found a hair sample
from Akash's bedroom.

1006
01:16:26,417 --> 01:16:28,250
The killer's hair sample?

1007
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,750
I took samples of everyone who comes
to Akash's house and tested it.

1008
01:16:33,042 --> 01:16:34,083
There was no match.

1009
01:16:34,292 --> 01:16:35,667
Who else’s could it be?

1010
01:16:36,167 --> 01:16:38,542
You just round up the suspect...

1011
01:16:38,875 --> 01:16:41,500
I'll check for the DNA match
and confirm it.

1012
01:16:42,667 --> 01:16:45,208
You asked for additional evidence, didn’t you?
We got it!

1013
01:16:49,667 --> 01:16:52,333
He thought he had destroyed
all evidence...

1014
01:16:53,708 --> 01:16:58,125
But he wouldn’t have dreamt that
a single strand of his hair...

1015
01:16:58,417 --> 01:17:00,417
was going to end his story.

1016
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,875
Even we didn't expect
the case to end so soon.

1017
01:17:11,375 --> 01:17:13,792
'DAY 2'

1018
01:17:14,417 --> 01:17:16,583
6:40 AM

1019
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,375
What?
- I need to go to the bathroom.

1020
01:17:54,792 --> 01:17:56,458
He's been throwing up since morning.

1021
01:17:56,875 --> 01:17:59,667
Didn’t I tell you
 he wouldn’t be able to take the beating?

1022
01:18:02,458 --> 01:18:04,167
It's not because of your beating, sir...

1023
01:18:04,417 --> 01:18:07,042
It's the liquor I had the day before.
-  Shut up, man.

1024
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:09,958
Your beating actually felt like a caress!

1025
01:18:10,042 --> 01:18:13,417
Before you leave this place,
you'll be crying at my feet!

1026
01:18:13,833 --> 01:18:16,167
Keep an eye on him.
I'll go home and be back.

1027
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:17,083
Okay, sir.

1028
01:18:18,292 --> 01:18:20,167
Wear your shirt and sit there.

1029
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:21,958
You shouldn't move an inch.

1030
01:18:22,458 --> 01:18:23,208
Go!

1031
01:18:23,875 --> 01:18:25,208
Muruga...
- Sir?

1032
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:27,167
Keep an eye on him.
I'm going to the toilet.

1033
01:18:27,208 --> 01:18:28,167
Okay, sir.

1034
01:18:56,208 --> 01:18:57,542
You've been asked to use this.

1035
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:04,333
Sir! Sir...

1036
01:19:04,458 --> 01:19:06,708
Sir, someone please come.
He is running away.

1037
01:19:06,792 --> 01:19:08,042
Someone open the door!

1038
01:19:08,125 --> 01:19:09,083
Sir!

1039
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:16,917
Stop.

1040
01:19:18,833 --> 01:19:21,208
Rajesh, Velu... He is getting away.
Catch him!

1041
01:19:24,042 --> 01:19:25,458
Velu, wake up.

1042
01:19:26,333 --> 01:19:28,417
Keep an eye on him.
I'm going to the store room.

1043
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,292
Is anyone down there?
Muruga? Rajesh?

1044
01:19:31,708 --> 01:19:32,958
Stop!

1045
01:20:20,458 --> 01:20:23,542
Muruga! Velu! What's that
noise down there?

1046
01:20:23,583 --> 01:20:25,208
Check what's going on.

1047
01:20:25,417 --> 01:20:26,583
Get off, guys!

1048
01:20:29,917 --> 01:20:32,208
Come here, man.
Rajesh...

1049
01:20:36,083 --> 01:20:38,083
Listen to him.

1050
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:40,083
Come quick.

1051
01:20:44,792 --> 01:20:46,583
Stop it, you guys.

1052
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:49,125
Sir, don't let them go.
I'll get the handcuffs.

1053
01:20:51,208 --> 01:20:52,708
Stop it.

1054
01:20:52,917 --> 01:20:56,083
Pull them apart!
Stop it, you guys.

1055
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:06,000
Let go of each other.

1056
01:21:08,292 --> 01:21:10,667
Oh no.
They're wrecking the station.

1057
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:30,750
No! He is going to shoot.

1058
01:21:37,917 --> 01:21:39,792
Here. Call the Sub Inspector.

1059
01:21:46,125 --> 01:21:47,750
Sir, come immediately.

1060
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:49,542
Kavin and Ezhil
are hitting each other.

1061
01:21:49,625 --> 01:21:51,833
Looks like they might just
beat each other to death.

1062
01:22:21,542 --> 01:22:23,000
Stop it, guys.

1063
01:22:23,167 --> 01:22:25,250
Constable, grab him.

1064
01:22:25,375 --> 01:22:27,833
You pull him that side.
- Sundar! Rajesh!

1065
01:22:28,333 --> 01:22:30,375
Grab him, guys.

1066
01:22:30,917 --> 01:22:33,625
The arrogance on this guy...
I'm going to thrash it out of him.

1067
01:22:34,917 --> 01:22:36,708
He hit the Sub Inspector!

1068
01:22:37,042 --> 01:22:38,958
You're playing with me?

1069
01:22:39,333 --> 01:22:40,458
Trying to escape?

1070
01:22:41,042 --> 01:22:43,750
Lock Kavin in a cell, too.
You dare hit the Sub Inspector?

1071
01:22:45,042 --> 01:22:46,875
You dare to hit a cop?

1072
01:22:47,792 --> 01:22:49,250
Did you notice, sir?

1073
01:22:49,333 --> 01:22:51,667
They already know each other.

1074
01:22:54,333 --> 01:22:55,875
Sir, there is so much blood.

1075
01:22:56,708 --> 01:22:58,250
Looks like he broke your nose.

1076
01:22:58,667 --> 01:23:00,125
You think he hit me on purpose?

1077
01:23:00,167 --> 01:23:02,667
No way. Looks like it
just happened in the scuffle.

1078
01:23:04,083 --> 01:23:06,083
There is blood on your back.

1079
01:23:06,458 --> 01:23:08,917
I think it was a piece of glass...
it's burning so bad!

1080
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:24,000
The results have arrived.
- Really?

1081
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:26,708
Didn't I tell you
the case is solved?

1082
01:23:27,292 --> 01:23:29,083
The killer is in your custody.

1083
01:23:34,708 --> 01:23:37,583
He is the killer.
Otherwise, why would he try to run?

1084
01:23:38,583 --> 01:23:40,583
Will you try to escape again?
Will you?

1085
01:23:41,208 --> 01:23:45,167
The sample you gave is a perfect match
with the one found in the bedroom.

1086
01:23:47,958 --> 01:23:49,292
Who is the killer?

1087
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:51,792
You’ve sent two samples....

1088
01:23:51,958 --> 01:23:53,667
Yeah, two suspects.

1089
01:23:54,083 --> 01:23:56,500
There is one small hiccup.
- Hiccup?

1090
01:23:56,708 --> 01:23:58,958
Both their DNAs matched.

1091
01:23:59,833 --> 01:24:02,792
Both their DNAs matched?
What are you saying?

1092
01:24:03,292 --> 01:24:06,125
Isn’t it impossible for two people
to have the same DNA?

1093
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:08,583
Even a son's DNA is different
from his father’s.

1094
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,417
Kavin and I are brothers.

1095
01:24:10,958 --> 01:24:12,083
Identical twins.

1096
01:24:13,667 --> 01:24:15,875
I was born 16 seconds after Ezhil.

1097
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:18,708
Do identical twins have the same DNA?

1098
01:24:18,875 --> 01:24:21,583
Yes. Even fraternal twins
don't have identical DNAs.

1099
01:24:22,167 --> 01:24:24,917
Identical twins are formed
from the same egg.

1100
01:24:25,458 --> 01:24:27,542
They look identical.

1101
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,625
They would also have identical DNAs.

1102
01:24:32,583 --> 01:24:37,708
If the men in your custody are identical twins,
this DNA would be of no use to you.

1103
01:24:39,917 --> 01:24:42,583
Are they identical twins?

1104
01:24:42,667 --> 01:24:44,208
Yes, I think so.

1105
01:24:44,583 --> 01:24:47,000
We had that doubt,
but we couldn't ask them.

1106
01:24:47,542 --> 01:24:50,958
We decided not to let them know
that we have the other person in custody.

1107
01:24:51,542 --> 01:24:52,500
I get it.

1108
01:24:52,542 --> 01:24:54,042
First, we got photo evidence.

1109
01:24:55,917 --> 01:24:58,750
That turned out to be of no use.
Then we got the DNA.

1110
01:25:00,792 --> 01:25:02,583
What more clinching than DNA?

1111
01:25:02,875 --> 01:25:04,583
Now you're telling me
 that's of no use either.

1112
01:25:04,625 --> 01:25:07,708
What can we do if all the solid evidence
we find turns out to be of no use?

1113
01:25:08,417 --> 01:25:09,625
Don't get vexed.

1114
01:25:09,875 --> 01:25:12,292
I've been researching that since morning.

1115
01:25:12,708 --> 01:25:14,542
We have science to help us.

1116
01:25:14,958 --> 01:25:17,167
There is a simple method
to find the killer.

1117
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:21,833
Even in the case of identical twins,
the fingerprints are different.

1118
01:25:22,292 --> 01:25:24,583
Even if the DNA is the same,
would the fingerprints be different?

1119
01:25:24,917 --> 01:25:26,375
That's the beauty of nature.

1120
01:25:26,417 --> 01:25:28,667
But we found no finger
prints at the crime site.

1121
01:25:28,792 --> 01:25:30,292
I'd have sent it
to you otherwise.

1122
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:33,000
You know how our department people work!

1123
01:25:33,458 --> 01:25:35,542
I'll send you two people from my team.

1124
01:25:35,667 --> 01:25:37,292
Visit the house again.

1125
01:25:37,625 --> 01:25:39,833
See if we might have missed some prints.

1126
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:43,750
You said the killer destroyed all evidence.
- Yes...

1127
01:25:43,917 --> 01:25:48,000
See if he might have left behind some print
without realizing it.

1128
01:25:48,417 --> 01:25:51,458
Even if it's a partial fingerprint,
we can close the case.

1129
01:26:04,292 --> 01:26:07,458
Searching the same place again!
It's so frustrating.

1130
01:26:07,958 --> 01:26:09,917
If there was a fingerprint,
we would have found it.

1131
01:26:10,083 --> 01:26:12,125
The house has also been cleaned.

1132
01:26:13,542 --> 01:26:16,750
Is it something that can be
 bought in a shop?

1133
01:26:17,917 --> 01:26:19,542
I feel like having a smoke.

1134
01:26:20,833 --> 01:26:21,833
Come on...

1135
01:26:22,292 --> 01:26:24,458
If that ogress sees us,
she’d give us a piece of her mind.

1136
01:26:28,125 --> 01:26:29,250
I'm going in.

1137
01:26:30,125 --> 01:26:32,167
The forensic guys are coming here next.

1138
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:35,292
It's not like we can see fingerprints
with a naked eye.

1139
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:38,292
The forensic guys are coming
here anyway.

1140
01:26:38,417 --> 01:26:40,917
Why is she dragging us
 into this unnecessarily?

1141
01:27:47,583 --> 01:27:48,500
Damn!

1142
01:27:58,958 --> 01:28:00,250
Madam...
- What?

1143
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,083
Why are we here?

1144
01:28:04,958 --> 01:28:06,458
For evidence, madam.

1145
01:28:06,875 --> 01:28:08,250
And what are you doing?

1146
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:18,500
Evidence, darn it.

1147
01:28:18,917 --> 01:28:21,000
Am I hiding the evidence in my bottom?

1148
01:28:23,958 --> 01:28:24,958
Yes, madam?

1149
01:28:25,583 --> 01:28:28,042
Your guys said they couldn't
find any new fingerprints.

1150
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:33,583
Is there another scientific way
 to solve the case?

1151
01:28:34,333 --> 01:28:35,667
Scientific...

1152
01:28:36,625 --> 01:28:39,833
There is one method that is scientific.

1153
01:28:41,375 --> 01:28:42,833
But it's a little difficult.

1154
01:28:43,375 --> 01:28:44,958
Whatever it is, tell me.

1155
01:28:45,583 --> 01:28:48,917
You need to use your police brain now
to find the killer.

1156
01:28:52,583 --> 01:28:54,625
I told you it is difficult!

1157
01:28:56,708 --> 01:28:58,583
Mom and dad had a love marriage.

1158
01:28:59,625 --> 01:29:01,208
Both their families didn't accept them.

1159
01:29:01,708 --> 01:29:04,000
My dad was a lawyer,
mom a bank employee.

1160
01:29:04,417 --> 01:29:06,542
They had compatibility issues.

1161
01:29:10,125 --> 01:29:12,000
They didn't get along.
- Ah!

1162
01:29:13,958 --> 01:29:15,792
They didn't realize that
when they were in love.

1163
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:17,417
They found out after marriage.

1164
01:29:24,375 --> 01:29:25,958
When they got divorced...

1165
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:28,250
Ezhil and I were six years old.

1166
01:29:28,583 --> 01:29:31,458
I went with my dad,
Kavin with my mom.

1167
01:29:34,667 --> 01:29:37,042
Who is my father?
- I am!

1168
01:29:37,583 --> 01:29:39,583
Who is my mother?
- I am.

1169
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:42,875
Who is my life?
- I am.

1170
01:29:45,667 --> 01:29:47,208
I heard your mom gambled...

1171
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:49,917
that she used to go to clubs?

1172
01:29:56,792 --> 01:29:58,042
Did Ezhil tell you that?

1173
01:30:00,333 --> 01:30:01,458
I'm going to--

1174
01:30:02,292 --> 01:30:04,292
I'm going to kill that mongrel.
Let go.

1175
01:30:04,375 --> 01:30:06,667
I'll crack your knees.

1176
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:09,792
Just sit down.
I'll rip your face apart.

1177
01:30:09,875 --> 01:30:11,417
I'm seated.
Let go of me!

1178
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:13,917
This is the first time I'm hearing
about a woman who goes to clubs.

1179
01:30:13,958 --> 01:30:15,583
First time we're hearing it, too!

1180
01:30:15,583 --> 01:30:18,500
That too with her son.
- No wonder he's turned out like this!

1181
01:30:18,542 --> 01:30:19,708
Some mother!

1182
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,333
My mom was the first graduate
in her family.

1183
01:30:28,875 --> 01:30:30,708
University gold medalist.

1184
01:30:31,792 --> 01:30:33,333
Didn't Ezhil tell you about that?

1185
01:30:34,542 --> 01:30:39,250
After she finished college, the bank
came knocking at her door with a job offer.

1186
01:30:40,042 --> 01:30:41,875
If anyone came asking for help...

1187
01:30:42,208 --> 01:30:44,208
she'd just give whatever she had.

1188
01:30:44,333 --> 01:30:45,958
Didn't that dog tell you any of this?

1189
01:30:46,083 --> 01:30:49,083
The doctors said he will survive
only if we perform an operation.

1190
01:30:54,917 --> 01:30:55,958
This is all I have.

1191
01:30:56,375 --> 01:30:58,292
Sell this, and manage your expenses.

1192
01:31:24,583 --> 01:31:27,708
It's because you ate fried food
on an empty stomach.

1193
01:31:28,208 --> 01:31:30,542
From tomorrow, we are not going
anywhere near the club.

1194
01:31:43,167 --> 01:31:47,375
I don't know how and when
she developed the gambling habit.

1195
01:31:47,958 --> 01:31:49,542
It's a form of disease, too.

1196
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:51,917
Today, it even has a name - Ludomania.

1197
01:31:52,542 --> 01:31:55,458
Who knows what emotions
ran in her mind?

1198
01:31:56,083 --> 01:31:58,208
She had it under control for several years.

1199
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:01,167
She didn't have a happy marriage.

1200
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:02,667
Pressure.

1201
01:32:02,833 --> 01:32:03,792
Stress.

1202
01:32:04,333 --> 01:32:05,542
It triggered her.

1203
01:32:06,208 --> 01:32:08,750
Every human being has some weakness.

1204
01:32:09,292 --> 01:32:11,333
For my mom, it was playing cards.

1205
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Does that make her a terrible mother?

1206
01:32:14,292 --> 01:32:16,375
You guys take bribes, right?

1207
01:32:16,958 --> 01:32:18,667
Does that make you terrible fathers?

1208
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:24,833
'KAVIN - 13 YEARS OLD'

1209
01:32:49,167 --> 01:32:50,042
Mom?

1210
01:32:56,917 --> 01:32:59,458
I lost this month's entire salary.

1211
01:33:02,083 --> 01:33:03,458
What am I going to do?

1212
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:21,667
Why are you probing into our past
instead of enquiring about Akash's murder?

1213
01:33:22,417 --> 01:33:25,667
Please understand this about Ezhil.
He is a compulsive liar.

1214
01:33:26,083 --> 01:33:27,625
All he does is lie.

1215
01:33:27,958 --> 01:33:30,583
If he says ten things,
eight out of those are lies.

1216
01:33:31,125 --> 01:33:33,458
He underwent psychiatric treatment
for one year.

1217
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:34,667
You know that?

1218
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:36,875
Did he say I underwent
psychiatric treatment?

1219
01:33:37,458 --> 01:33:41,417
Call up Salem Mental Hospital and check...
whether it was him or I!

1220
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:44,083
From age 16 to 17...

1221
01:33:44,375 --> 01:33:48,042
Who spent one full year in there?
Enquire and find out for yourself.

1222
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:49,958
Please go and enquire!

1223
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:52,375
2006 to 2007.

1224
01:33:52,583 --> 01:33:56,292
They just locked Ezhil up
for one entire year.

1225
01:33:57,375 --> 01:33:59,708
The fork we use to eat...?

1226
01:34:00,333 --> 01:34:03,500
He stabbed the Chief Doctor's neck
with a fork...

1227
01:34:03,667 --> 01:34:06,125
and the doctor was fighting for his life
in the hospital for one month.

1228
01:34:06,417 --> 01:34:08,917
Go ask him.
He'll tell you story after story.

1229
01:34:10,125 --> 01:34:13,750
Go ahead and ask the doctor
who stabbed him - Kavin or I.

1230
01:34:14,542 --> 01:34:15,958
Your case will be solved right there.

1231
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:18,000
What you said is true, madam...

1232
01:34:18,917 --> 01:34:20,167
He was a lawyer's son.

1233
01:34:20,208 --> 01:34:23,500
Just because the doctor said something,
he stabbed him with a fork.

1234
01:34:24,542 --> 01:34:26,833
The boy's name?
I need to know his name.

1235
01:34:26,875 --> 01:34:30,375
I don't know. That incident happened
before I joined work here.

1236
01:34:30,708 --> 01:34:33,292
No one who worked back then
is still around.

1237
01:34:33,583 --> 01:34:35,292
But I've heard those stories.

1238
01:34:35,333 --> 01:34:36,875
I've seen that chief doctor.

1239
01:34:36,958 --> 01:34:40,583
He developed a speech
impediment after that stabbing.

1240
01:34:40,833 --> 01:34:42,208
He died only last year.

1241
01:34:42,417 --> 01:34:44,958
Wasn't the boy a patient there?
You must have records.

1242
01:34:45,417 --> 01:34:48,250
The record room got wrecked
because of the floods last year.

1243
01:34:48,333 --> 01:34:50,750
I dumped all the records
in the warehouse.

1244
01:34:51,208 --> 01:34:53,333
If I find anything,
I'll send it over.

1245
01:34:54,417 --> 01:34:56,250
My brain is already fried...

1246
01:34:56,625 --> 01:34:58,208
and one of them
 is a psycho?

1247
01:34:58,583 --> 01:35:00,417
I'm going home tonight.

1248
01:35:00,958 --> 01:35:02,708
One of you take over my shift.

1249
01:35:03,708 --> 01:35:06,000
What is Kavin's problem?

1250
01:35:06,708 --> 01:35:07,708
I don't know.

1251
01:35:07,917 --> 01:35:11,000
He was like this when he returned home
after mom's death.

1252
01:35:11,583 --> 01:35:14,292
Rage. Mania. Brutishness.

1253
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,542
He was always the problem child.

1254
01:35:18,125 --> 01:35:19,542
How did your mom die?

1255
01:35:20,292 --> 01:35:21,208
Jaundice.

1256
01:35:22,542 --> 01:35:23,875
That's what dad said.

1257
01:35:24,875 --> 01:35:26,333
How did your mom die?

1258
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:29,750
Jaundice.

1259
01:35:43,375 --> 01:35:46,375
There is something mysterious
about their mom's death.

1260
01:35:48,125 --> 01:35:50,333
I think Kavin might be
the only one who knows the truth.

1261
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:53,792
Collect any information you can
about their mom's death.

1262
01:35:53,917 --> 01:35:54,792
Okay, madam.

1263
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:22,875
Mom?

1264
01:36:32,458 --> 01:36:34,292
You're Lakshmi's son, right?
- Yes.

1265
01:36:34,333 --> 01:36:36,167
I am your mother's colleague.

1266
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:38,250
I found her lying on the road.

1267
01:36:38,542 --> 01:36:40,583
Looks like she lost her salary.

1268
01:36:41,417 --> 01:36:44,708
I took her to the doctor.
He said she has high BP.

1269
01:36:45,167 --> 01:36:47,292
He wanted to run some tests.

1270
01:36:48,250 --> 01:36:50,542
Looks like she hasn't been eating well.

1271
01:36:51,583 --> 01:36:53,292
Call me if you need any help.

1272
01:36:53,917 --> 01:36:56,000
Your mother has my number.
Okay?

1273
01:37:47,333 --> 01:37:48,875
Who is my father?

1274
01:37:51,458 --> 01:37:52,875
Who is my mother?

1275
01:37:58,667 --> 01:38:00,167
Who is my life?

1276
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:24,875
Nothing like what you think happened, Kavin.

1277
01:38:29,917 --> 01:38:30,833
Come here.

1278
01:38:40,958 --> 01:38:41,958
Look at mom.

1279
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,375
I don't care what people say about me.

1280
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,167
You are my life.

1281
01:38:58,708 --> 01:39:01,042
What you think about me
is all that matters.

1282
01:39:05,542 --> 01:39:07,708
Your mom isn't that sort of a woman.

1283
01:39:21,708 --> 01:39:23,542
What kind of a person am I?

1284
01:39:24,333 --> 01:39:27,792
Did I give birth to you
just to see you cry all alone at night?

1285
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:30,417
My father was so strict.

1286
01:39:30,792 --> 01:39:32,708
I mustn't stand by the window.

1287
01:39:33,042 --> 01:39:35,167
I mustn't talk to the neighbours.

1288
01:39:35,792 --> 01:39:37,833
I mustn't return late from college.

1289
01:39:38,542 --> 01:39:40,625
I thought I was escaping hell...

1290
01:39:41,375 --> 01:39:43,292
but ended up in a different hell.

1291
01:39:50,333 --> 01:39:52,375
I won't gamble any more.

1292
01:39:52,542 --> 01:39:53,500
I swear.

1293
01:40:02,167 --> 01:40:05,500
My prince...
How did I end up making you cry?

1294
01:40:12,875 --> 01:40:14,833
What kind of a mother am I?

1295
01:40:26,458 --> 01:40:28,583
I won't go to work today.

1296
01:40:29,375 --> 01:40:31,250
I'll make you milk pudding.

1297
01:40:31,542 --> 01:40:33,375
Let's eat,
and go watch a movie.

1298
01:40:34,667 --> 01:40:35,667
Okay?

1299
01:40:44,458 --> 01:40:47,000
Come home straight after school.

1300
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,542
No football today.

1301
01:40:52,208 --> 01:40:53,208
Okay?

1302
01:41:01,250 --> 01:41:03,875
Only then will I believe
that you trust me.

1303
01:42:03,208 --> 01:42:05,042
After my mom died...
- Come...

1304
01:42:05,125 --> 01:42:07,583
My dad brought Kavin home.
- Come in.

1305
01:42:10,917 --> 01:42:12,583
Kavin had several complexes.

1306
01:42:15,042 --> 01:42:16,667
I had everything he didn't have.

1307
01:42:17,833 --> 01:42:18,708
Dad?

1308
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:21,833
How is that my fault?

1309
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:24,875
I was scared to even
look at my dad.

1310
01:42:26,875 --> 01:42:28,292
He was so distant.

1311
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:32,292
Ezhil didn't treat me
like his brother.

1312
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:38,417
I felt like a stranger in that house.

1313
01:42:40,542 --> 01:42:42,833
He'd be at home for six months...
then he'd run away.

1314
01:42:43,125 --> 01:42:45,250
He'd come back...
and then run away again.

1315
01:42:48,042 --> 01:42:50,417
'KAVIN - AGE 16'

1316
01:42:50,583 --> 01:42:52,833
He was dismissed from every school
my father put him in.

1317
01:42:53,542 --> 01:42:54,542
Bad friendships.

1318
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:56,500
Bad habits.

1319
01:42:56,708 --> 01:42:57,750
Get up.
- Sir, who are you?

1320
01:42:57,792 --> 01:42:59,875
What are you doing, dad?

1321
01:43:00,708 --> 01:43:02,167
Like mother, like son.

1322
01:43:02,292 --> 01:43:03,917
Don't talk about mom!

1323
01:43:05,250 --> 01:43:07,125
Stop it, guys.

1324
01:43:07,667 --> 01:43:09,708
Let go, dad.
- Just stop it.

1325
01:43:12,167 --> 01:43:13,417
Kavin, stop it.

1326
01:43:13,958 --> 01:43:16,375
Ezhil!
Stop it, guys.

1327
01:43:16,833 --> 01:43:17,792
Enough.

1328
01:43:19,292 --> 01:43:20,792
I said, stop it.

1329
01:43:22,417 --> 01:43:24,333
Let go, dad.
- That's enough.

1330
01:43:24,833 --> 01:43:26,833
I wish you people had died
instead of mom.

1331
01:43:28,875 --> 01:43:30,500
I joined college after that.

1332
01:43:31,208 --> 01:43:33,417
It was my father's wish
that I study law.

1333
01:43:34,458 --> 01:43:36,250
But Kavin was the one
interested in it.

1334
01:43:36,750 --> 01:43:38,792
But he didn't have the discipline
to attend college.

1335
01:43:39,042 --> 01:43:41,167
He discontinued his studies
within a year.

1336
01:43:41,917 --> 01:43:43,458
He'd come home occasionally...

1337
01:43:44,458 --> 01:43:45,958
steal something,
and leave.

1338
01:43:47,875 --> 01:43:50,250
He had only one obsession in life.

1339
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:52,333
Me.

1340
01:43:54,167 --> 01:43:57,125
No matter what I did,
he was fixated on doing it better than me.

1341
01:43:59,833 --> 01:44:01,083
I know three languages.

1342
01:44:01,667 --> 01:44:03,250
Kavin learnt six languages.

1343
01:44:03,875 --> 01:44:05,750
When Ezhil was in the
final year of college...

1344
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:07,667
our dad passed away.

1345
01:44:07,875 --> 01:44:10,583
After that,
I lost all contact with Kavin.

1346
01:44:22,708 --> 01:44:27,042
I found out that Kavin was following me
only very recently.

1347
01:44:29,375 --> 01:44:31,000
My life was on a smooth upward curve.

1348
01:44:31,667 --> 01:44:32,833
I finished college.

1349
01:44:33,333 --> 01:44:34,708
I landed a well-paying job.

1350
01:44:34,958 --> 01:44:37,333
Then, I started my own construction company.

1351
01:44:37,583 --> 01:44:41,500
But Kavin's life was stagnating
 like a pond.

1352
01:44:42,917 --> 01:44:44,708
He couldn't take that!

1353
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,042
Jealousy.

1354
01:44:47,250 --> 01:44:48,208
Anger.

1355
01:44:48,458 --> 01:44:49,458
Hatred.

1356
01:44:50,542 --> 01:44:52,292
He dated many girls...

1357
01:44:53,333 --> 01:44:57,625
but didn’t have a single girl
who truly loved him.

1358
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:20,667
What did he steal?

1359
01:45:22,333 --> 01:45:24,917
A solitaire ring.
I got it for Deepika.

1360
01:45:26,375 --> 01:45:28,000
Do you know any cops?

1361
01:45:29,542 --> 01:45:31,833
I don't want to register any case.
- I'll take care of it.

1362
01:45:44,417 --> 01:45:46,250
They say he doesn't have the ring.

1363
01:45:46,708 --> 01:45:49,208
They held him in the station for 2 days,
and let him go.

1364
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,875
I didn't take that ring.

1365
01:45:55,125 --> 01:45:57,250
It's in the top drawer
of your dressing table.

1366
01:45:58,083 --> 01:45:59,042
Go check.

1367
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:13,625
There is a photo of mom in your house.

1368
01:46:14,667 --> 01:46:16,042
I only came for that.

1369
01:46:16,292 --> 01:46:19,500
They broke my hand
at the station.

1370
01:46:19,875 --> 01:46:23,042
The doctor says it will be bent
even if it heals.

1371
01:46:23,667 --> 01:46:25,500
I'm urinating blood.

1372
01:46:25,917 --> 01:46:27,375
Just know this, Ezhil.

1373
01:46:29,667 --> 01:46:32,625
You'll be in this same situation one day.

1374
01:46:35,292 --> 01:46:39,333
And I'll be the reason for that.

1375
01:46:41,458 --> 01:46:44,208
After that, I’m only seeing him now.

1376
01:46:44,958 --> 01:46:48,583
He is trying to frame me
holding that grudge.

1377
01:46:59,458 --> 01:47:01,208
What he says is very clear.

1378
01:47:07,708 --> 01:47:09,042
Sir, can I say something?

1379
01:47:09,375 --> 01:47:10,792
He is lying, sir.

1380
01:47:11,417 --> 01:47:13,208
If he did nothing wrong,
why should he run?

1381
01:47:15,208 --> 01:47:16,208
Hello?

1382
01:47:21,083 --> 01:47:22,208
Stay on the line.

1383
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:43,417
Sir, the inspector is calling you.

1384
01:47:44,875 --> 01:47:46,167
Ganesh...
- Madam?

1385
01:47:46,333 --> 01:47:47,375
What is it?

1386
01:47:47,792 --> 01:47:48,708
I don't know, madam.

1387
01:47:56,792 --> 01:47:58,583
The inspector asked you
a question yesterday.

1388
01:47:59,542 --> 01:48:01,375
You never answered it.

1389
01:48:02,333 --> 01:48:03,292
What question?

1390
01:48:04,583 --> 01:48:06,542
You had an office party
on the 2nd...

1391
01:48:07,167 --> 01:48:08,667
but you left early.

1392
01:48:10,875 --> 01:48:13,833
You told your friend
you had to go to the registration office.

1393
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:17,958
But you never went to
the registration office the next day.

1394
01:48:19,250 --> 01:48:20,458
Why did you lie?

1395
01:48:28,625 --> 01:48:29,792
Tell me, don’t be afraid.

1396
01:48:30,125 --> 01:48:33,458
If you tell me the truth,
I'll make sure nothing happens to you.

1397
01:48:34,667 --> 01:48:36,083
8-4-2-0

1398
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:37,583
5-5-5

1399
01:48:37,667 --> 01:48:38,792
0-0-0-1

1400
01:48:40,792 --> 01:48:42,375
The inspector's daughter's number.

1401
01:48:44,250 --> 01:48:45,292
Yes, madam.

1402
01:48:45,708 --> 01:48:47,917
My husband and I
came to Chennai that day.

1403
01:48:48,250 --> 01:48:50,083
Ezhil came to see us.

1404
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:55,417
We had a lot of debt here.
We asked him for help.

1405
01:48:55,917 --> 01:48:57,458
He gave us some money.

1406
01:48:57,708 --> 01:49:00,458
Why are you asking me all this, madam?
Is there a problem?

1407
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:01,583
No.

1408
01:49:08,375 --> 01:49:11,000
I couldn't tell the inspector
I went to see his daughter.

1409
01:49:11,917 --> 01:49:13,500
If he finds out
where they live...

1410
01:49:14,542 --> 01:49:15,917
he won't spare them.

1411
01:49:19,667 --> 01:49:22,083
Constable, lock the door.
- Yes, madam.

1412
01:49:28,250 --> 01:49:30,083
Where is the inspector and Bhaskar?
- I don't know, madam.

1413
01:49:30,208 --> 01:49:32,583
They both discussed something
and then they left.

1414
01:49:38,917 --> 01:49:40,417
Who knows how to
open a lock...

1415
01:49:41,333 --> 01:49:42,708
without a key?

1416
01:49:47,167 --> 01:49:48,583
Everyone knows, madam.

1417
01:50:04,917 --> 01:50:06,417
I need Ezhil's car keys.

1418
01:50:12,792 --> 01:50:14,708
You still suspect Ezhil?

1419
01:50:16,583 --> 01:50:17,917
On the night of the 2nd...

1420
01:50:17,958 --> 01:50:21,417
he said he was stuck at Little Mount
for over 3 hours because of a flat tyre.

1421
01:50:23,917 --> 01:50:25,917
I canvassed the whole area.

1422
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:30,333
We couldn't find one witness
who saw him there that night.

1423
01:50:36,917 --> 01:50:39,625
I checked with all call taxi agencies
that cover that route.

1424
01:50:40,083 --> 01:50:42,333
I couldn't find the guy
 he told us about.

1425
01:50:43,125 --> 01:50:44,917
Madam...
Ezhil's car keys.

1426
01:50:50,583 --> 01:50:53,000
Now we'll know
whether or not he was speaking the truth.

1427
01:50:53,375 --> 01:50:55,042
I had a flat tyre on the way.

1428
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:14,292
Yes, madam.
It’s punctured.

1429
01:51:30,667 --> 01:51:33,958
In case the police come looking for you...
- The police?

1430
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:37,083
Tell them you weren't feeling well
on the 2nd.

1431
01:51:37,458 --> 01:51:38,500
They'll leave.

1432
01:51:38,833 --> 01:51:41,167
But before they come the second time...

1433
01:51:42,417 --> 01:51:43,375
flee!

1434
01:51:44,292 --> 01:51:46,125
Why? What did you do?

1435
01:51:48,333 --> 01:51:49,667
How did you pay back Dass?

1436
01:51:51,042 --> 01:51:52,250
It’s none of your business.

1437
01:51:58,750 --> 01:52:00,833
Won't you check if the vehicle
has enough diesel?

1438
01:52:00,917 --> 01:52:03,583
Sorry, madam. This is an old jeep,
and it's just guzzling diesel.

1439
01:52:05,542 --> 01:52:06,417
Madam?

1440
01:52:07,583 --> 01:52:09,833
Kavin's friend...
he's gone missing.

1441
01:52:10,292 --> 01:52:11,750
He's gone missing?

1442
01:52:12,083 --> 01:52:15,375
I had informed the local station
to keep an eye on him.

1443
01:52:16,042 --> 01:52:17,625
But the house is locked now...

1444
01:52:18,917 --> 01:52:20,417
and they say
he's gone missing.

1445
01:52:22,667 --> 01:52:25,917
Aren't you ashamed to let him
escape and come up with excuses?

1446
01:52:26,333 --> 01:52:28,167
Madam, one minute.

1447
01:52:29,417 --> 01:52:31,625
You asked us to check
Akash's bank account.

1448
01:52:32,875 --> 01:52:36,417
He withdrew 12 lakhs the week
before he died.

1449
01:52:37,833 --> 01:52:39,458
The day after the murder...

1450
01:52:39,875 --> 01:52:43,333
Kavin repaid 9 lakhs
to a loan shark.

1451
01:52:50,208 --> 01:52:54,750
The inspector received this information
by around 6 o'clock.

1452
01:52:56,542 --> 01:52:58,708
He told us to keep it from you.

1453
01:53:00,375 --> 01:53:01,458
Where is he?

1454
01:53:09,125 --> 01:53:10,000
Get down.

1455
01:53:10,250 --> 01:53:11,125
Sir.

1456
01:53:14,917 --> 01:53:15,792
Come.

1457
01:53:18,208 --> 01:53:20,958
There was a theft near Minerva theatre
on the 2nd.

1458
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:22,542
At a jewellery store.

1459
01:53:25,583 --> 01:53:26,708
Unsolved.

1460
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:30,000
The inspector is framing Kavin for that.

1461
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:31,708
Place your hand here.

1462
01:53:37,292 --> 01:53:39,583
Is he trying to setup Ezhil
for Akash's murder?

1463
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:46,417
If Kavin was at the jewellery store
on the night of the 2nd...

1464
01:53:48,333 --> 01:53:50,417
He couldn't have killed Akash.

1465
01:53:50,833 --> 01:53:51,833
Correct?

1466
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,708
That would automatically mean
Ezhil killed Akash.

1467
01:53:56,667 --> 01:53:59,958
This is just a theft case. Even if he
admits to it, he'd be out soon.

1468
01:54:01,375 --> 01:54:03,000
Don't let anyone know
that I told you.

1469
01:54:05,208 --> 01:54:07,542
Only if the call taxi driver
 who apparently helped him...

1470
01:54:08,458 --> 01:54:12,583
comes forward,
can Ezhil be saved.

1471
01:54:13,125 --> 01:54:16,000
That too, only if what Ezhil said
was actually true!

1472
01:54:19,458 --> 01:54:20,875
He asked you to
place your hand on it.

1473
01:54:21,125 --> 01:54:22,125
What for, sir?

1474
01:54:22,333 --> 01:54:24,583
Idiot! He is saying it for your own good.

1475
01:54:26,583 --> 01:54:28,375
The money from Akash's home is missing.

1476
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:32,042
You repaid a loan of 9 lakhs
the day after his murder.

1477
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:36,167
That one point is enough
to get you hanged.

1478
01:54:36,958 --> 01:54:39,625
Sir, I won that money gambling.

1479
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:42,417
What?

1480
01:54:42,917 --> 01:54:45,542
There is this Marwadi called Ashok Seth
behind Adayar Sheraton.

1481
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:49,042
Go ask him.

1482
01:54:49,417 --> 01:54:51,792
We play poker in my house
once a year.

1483
01:54:52,083 --> 01:54:53,875
The minimum stake is 1 lakh.

1484
01:54:54,458 --> 01:54:55,583
I only have a lakh.

1485
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,875
Kavin had come
on the night of the 2nd.

1486
01:54:58,208 --> 01:55:01,000
He played all night.
He won 10 lakhs.

1487
01:55:03,792 --> 01:55:05,458
The AC is a good friend of mine.

1488
01:55:06,708 --> 01:55:07,917
You may leave.

1489
01:55:08,125 --> 01:55:09,083
Okay, sir.

1490
01:55:26,458 --> 01:55:27,958
Case solved.
- Tell me.

1491
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,917
Ezhil killed Akash.

1492
01:55:30,083 --> 01:55:31,000
Sir!

1493
01:55:31,875 --> 01:55:33,458
Step aside.
I need to talk to him.

1494
01:55:33,833 --> 01:55:34,792
Sir...

1495
01:55:35,583 --> 01:55:37,333
Our troubles have come to an end.
- What?

1496
01:55:37,375 --> 01:55:38,917
Akash's murder is solved.

1497
01:55:40,542 --> 01:55:42,542
Akash was killed by Kavin.

1498
01:55:45,917 --> 01:55:49,167
The call taxi driver who Ezhil mentioned
had helped him...

1499
01:55:49,417 --> 01:55:51,208
it seems he has come to our station.

1500
01:55:52,125 --> 01:55:54,125
Remember, I told you way back.

1501
01:55:54,333 --> 01:55:55,958
That Ezhil is innocent.

1502
01:56:10,042 --> 01:56:12,208
We were canvassing that area
for 2 full days...

1503
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:15,583
saying if the call taxi driver is for real,
he must report to us immediately.

1504
01:56:15,750 --> 01:56:18,167
He apparently returned from Theni
only this morning.

1505
01:56:18,208 --> 01:56:20,250
He heard about the news,
and turned up here.

1506
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,375
Have you questioned him?

1507
01:56:22,792 --> 01:56:24,667
I did, sir.
He is genuine.

1508
01:56:33,917 --> 01:56:37,500
When that call taxi driver
came to the station of his own accord...

1509
01:56:38,250 --> 01:56:41,500
It became obvious that Ezhil
couldn't have committed that murder.

1510
01:56:42,083 --> 01:56:44,625
If Kavin had won the money
by playing cards...

1511
01:56:45,292 --> 01:56:48,042
There is no need
for him to kill Akash.

1512
01:56:48,958 --> 01:56:50,958
We were back to where we started.

1513
01:56:55,292 --> 01:56:58,833
Take it to court, GK.
Let them decide.

1514
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:00,542
No other go.

1515
01:57:09,250 --> 01:57:11,542
The department couldn't do anything more.

1516
01:57:12,125 --> 01:57:13,708
The case went on for eight months.

1517
01:57:14,458 --> 01:57:16,167
Finally, the day of the verdict came.

1518
01:57:17,167 --> 01:57:21,542
CC 225/2017
Ezhil, Kavin.

1519
01:57:22,167 --> 01:57:23,042
Come.

1520
01:57:32,083 --> 01:57:34,750
It felt like our heads would burst
waiting for the judgment.

1521
01:57:45,792 --> 01:57:47,042
Come here, both of you.

1522
01:57:57,458 --> 01:57:58,458
Step forward.

1523
01:57:59,958 --> 01:58:01,292
You come forward, too.

1524
01:58:12,667 --> 01:58:14,458
One of you is a murderer.

1525
01:58:16,333 --> 01:58:18,042
I have no doubt about that.

1526
01:58:18,875 --> 01:58:20,583
Inspite of several adjournments...

1527
01:58:20,667 --> 01:58:23,708
The prosecution couldn't exactly prove
which of you two did it.

1528
01:58:24,083 --> 01:58:25,167
That's the problem.

1529
01:58:25,917 --> 01:58:29,708
I want to lock the criminal behind bars,
but I don't know which of you two did it.

1530
01:58:30,083 --> 01:58:33,167
I can give a verdict
only with the facts presented to me.

1531
01:58:33,708 --> 01:58:34,875
Public Prosecutor?

1532
01:58:35,292 --> 01:58:37,375
The law doesn't allow us
to imprison them both.

1533
01:58:37,583 --> 01:58:40,083
Because one of them is innocent.

1534
01:58:40,375 --> 01:58:41,750
We can't punish him.

1535
01:58:42,083 --> 01:58:45,833
A hundred criminals may get away,
but no innocent person must be punished.

1536
01:58:46,375 --> 01:58:48,042
That's the way
our legal system functions.

1537
01:58:49,208 --> 01:58:52,250
I have no other go,
but to free both of them.

1538
01:58:53,542 --> 01:58:56,125
All of us were stunned
by the judgment.

1539
01:58:56,792 --> 01:58:59,542
No one expected a judgment like that!

1540
01:58:59,750 --> 01:59:01,542
Aren't you the Investigating Officer?
- Yes, sir.

1541
01:59:01,583 --> 01:59:03,333
This is a black mark
on your department.

1542
01:59:04,583 --> 01:59:07,750
Despite knowing one of them is the killer,
we have to set them free.

1543
01:59:08,625 --> 01:59:11,542
If both of them were set free,
who is the actual killer?

1544
01:59:22,708 --> 01:59:23,542
I don't know.

1545
01:59:24,833 --> 01:59:27,917
'AFTER THE VERDICT'

1546
01:59:28,250 --> 01:59:31,542
'ONE WEEK LATER'

1547
01:59:34,792 --> 01:59:35,708
Madam...

1548
01:59:36,250 --> 01:59:38,042
Things need to be shifted
to the new station...

1549
01:59:38,208 --> 01:59:40,458
Your table hasn't been cleared yet.

1550
01:59:46,917 --> 01:59:49,458
I asked you to put the photos
back at Ezhil's house.

1551
01:59:49,542 --> 01:59:51,667
Why are these still here?
- Sorry, madam. It got missed out.

1552
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:10,958
Give it to me.
I'll send them back through Senthil.

1553
02:00:16,417 --> 02:00:17,417
What, madam?

1554
02:00:24,667 --> 02:00:26,500
The case has been going on
for eight months now.

1555
02:00:26,750 --> 02:00:28,625
But she never came to see Ezhil.

1556
02:00:29,542 --> 02:00:30,833
I asked him way back.

1557
02:00:31,625 --> 02:00:34,750
He told me they broke up
right after he got charged and arrested.

1558
02:00:38,208 --> 02:00:39,250
What, madam?

1559
02:00:39,958 --> 02:00:41,000
The first day...

1560
02:00:41,667 --> 02:00:44,625
We showed Ezhil the selfie
when we got him in for questioning.

1561
02:00:44,792 --> 02:00:45,792
You remember?

1562
02:00:51,167 --> 02:00:52,292
Do you remember?

1563
02:00:54,375 --> 02:00:56,500
He saw the photo and went silent.

1564
02:00:56,542 --> 02:01:00,000
He never said that it wasn't him
but his twin brother.

1565
02:01:10,083 --> 02:01:12,625
This is Malar speaking.
Sub Inspector, Neelangarai Station.

1566
02:01:13,208 --> 02:01:14,167
Tell me, madam.

1567
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,833
You said Akash was in love with a girl
during school, right?

1568
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:20,333
That it was one sided?
- Yes.

1569
02:01:20,500 --> 02:01:21,708
What's the girl's name?

1570
02:01:23,250 --> 02:01:24,167
Deepika.

1571
02:01:36,208 --> 02:01:38,208
We're missing something, Constable.

1572
02:01:38,917 --> 02:01:41,333
It's right in front of us,
but I don't know what it is.

1573
02:01:45,292 --> 02:01:48,375
'ONE MONTH BEFORE THE MURDER'

1574
02:01:49,083 --> 02:01:50,875
Deepika never came to Delhi.

1575
02:01:51,208 --> 02:01:53,250
She said she'd come,
but she never did.

1576
02:01:53,667 --> 02:01:56,708
I tried calling her back,
but her phone was switched off.

1577
02:01:58,917 --> 02:01:59,917
Thanks, Divya.

1578
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Ezhil...

1579
02:02:01,792 --> 02:02:04,250
I don't know how to tell you this...

1580
02:02:05,458 --> 02:02:10,125
A friend of mine spotted Deepika
with a man at the Vijaywada Railway Station.

1581
02:02:11,042 --> 02:02:12,292
It seems like...

1582
02:02:13,125 --> 02:02:14,083
they were hugging.

1583
02:02:16,708 --> 02:02:19,667
I didn't want to tell you about this...

1584
02:02:20,625 --> 02:02:22,667
No, Divya.
You are mistaken.

1585
02:02:23,167 --> 02:02:24,875
Someone witnessed it, Ezhil.

1586
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:26,958
Deepika isn't that sort of a girl.

1587
02:02:27,083 --> 02:02:28,417
Forget her, Ezhil.

1588
02:02:28,708 --> 02:02:30,167
Stop torturing yourself.

1589
02:02:30,917 --> 02:02:32,958
She hasn't gone missing.
She is gone.

1590
02:02:33,625 --> 02:02:35,292
Even her mom doesn't miss her.

1591
02:02:35,500 --> 02:02:37,417
You're the only one
still looking for her.

1592
02:02:39,125 --> 02:02:40,708
You said she was with a man, right?

1593
02:02:41,292 --> 02:02:42,375
Who is he?

1594
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,375
Deepika's classmate from school.

1595
02:02:45,708 --> 02:02:46,958
His name is Akash.

1596
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:58,500
I spiked Deepika's drink.

1597
02:03:00,750 --> 02:03:03,250
She fainted.
Then I took her to Vizag...

1598
02:03:04,375 --> 02:03:07,000
and used her like my wife
for 2 days.

1599
02:03:10,625 --> 02:03:13,667
Then I killed her.
I made it look like a drug overdose.

1600
02:03:13,750 --> 02:03:16,125
I spent 10 lakhs
to make the case disappear.

1601
02:03:19,292 --> 02:03:23,000
She believed till the very end
that you'd come for her.

1602
02:03:43,792 --> 02:03:46,500
'NOW'

1603
02:04:01,125 --> 02:04:05,000
They've sent us the records
from Salem Mental Hospital.

1604
02:04:12,667 --> 02:04:16,000
It seems they have all the records
except for the ones you requested.

1605
02:04:16,667 --> 02:04:19,542
They found a copy among the personal files
of the doctor who got stabbed.

1606
02:04:20,083 --> 02:04:21,667
They've sent us that.

1607
02:04:22,042 --> 02:04:23,667
Who was in the hospital?

1608
02:04:23,958 --> 02:04:25,375
Kavin or Ezhil?

1609
02:04:29,875 --> 02:04:30,958
Both of them.

1610
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:35,250
Ezhil was here for three months.
Kavin, an entire year.

1611
02:04:35,500 --> 02:04:39,250
When they were in the 10th grade,
they almost beat each other to death.

1612
02:04:39,667 --> 02:04:41,500
Did you read the last paragraph?

1613
02:04:42,125 --> 02:04:44,250
Read the doctor's handwritten notes.

1614
02:04:44,958 --> 02:04:50,000
"No matter what their differences are,
if there’s a problem they team up."

1615
02:05:09,167 --> 02:05:11,292
At first, I thought you came
just to give me trouble.

1616
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,958
Eventually I understood
you were there to save me.

1617
02:05:15,917 --> 02:05:16,875
What's this?

1618
02:05:30,333 --> 02:05:33,000
He got drunk and ran his motorcycle
into a police jeep.

1619
02:05:39,083 --> 02:05:40,875
He was caught for drunken driving.

1620
02:05:44,542 --> 02:05:46,500
Who crashed into our vehicle?

1621
02:05:47,917 --> 02:05:50,250
Even a month before you killed Akash...

1622
02:05:50,542 --> 02:05:52,417
I knew you were looking for him.

1623
02:05:55,167 --> 02:05:56,500
You destroyed the evidence.

1624
02:05:57,375 --> 02:05:59,250
But you didn't follow the investigation.

1625
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,125
I did.

1626
02:06:01,708 --> 02:06:03,542
I knew you'd get caught anyway.

1627
02:06:04,542 --> 02:06:05,833
An airtight case.

1628
02:06:07,208 --> 02:06:09,708
You would either get a life sentence,
or get hanged.

1629
02:06:14,875 --> 02:06:20,792
The doctor states that till the very end
he didn't know which of them stabbed him.

1630
02:06:23,292 --> 02:06:27,000
The mental hospital doctor didn't know
who stabbed him...

1631
02:06:27,625 --> 02:06:29,375
So he punished us both.

1632
02:06:29,917 --> 02:06:32,208
But I knew that the court
can't do that.

1633
02:06:35,542 --> 02:06:38,125
I thought you can get away
only if I get caught.

1634
02:06:38,458 --> 02:06:41,625
So I just decided to take this gamble
and took the plunge.

1635
02:06:41,750 --> 02:06:44,250
Salem Hospital reports?
- I stole them.

1636
02:06:44,750 --> 02:06:47,500
Even if they find it,
it's going to prove nothing.

1637
02:06:53,667 --> 02:06:56,792
I knew that Inspector GK would go
to any extreme to frame you.

1638
02:06:57,292 --> 02:06:59,333
I'm going to bury you.

1639
02:06:59,833 --> 02:07:03,000
The Inspector can do anything he wants.
He is the King card.

1640
02:07:03,083 --> 02:07:05,292
I needed a trump card to beat that.

1641
02:07:05,833 --> 02:07:07,042
I studied Malar.

1642
02:07:07,417 --> 02:07:08,583
What happened, madam?

1643
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,833
He played me from the moment he
entered the station.

1644
02:07:17,833 --> 02:07:20,250
He made sure my concentration
never went towards Ezhil.

1645
02:07:21,375 --> 02:07:23,833
I knew she had previously
helped two innocent people.

1646
02:07:24,042 --> 02:07:26,625
I thought if I played my cards right,
she might help you too.

1647
02:07:26,667 --> 02:07:31,250
No one apart from you and I know that
I arranged for the call taxi witness.

1648
02:07:31,708 --> 02:07:32,958
And no one should know.

1649
02:07:34,917 --> 02:07:37,542
Malar won't let go of this case.
She will crack it somehow.

1650
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:39,792
She would have
found out the truth by now.

1651
02:07:39,958 --> 02:07:41,375
What are you saying, madam?

1652
02:07:42,458 --> 02:07:43,750
I don't understand.

1653
02:07:43,875 --> 02:07:45,875
She can't reopen this case.

1654
02:07:46,542 --> 02:07:48,375
She arranged a false witness for you.

1655
02:07:49,167 --> 02:07:51,042
If she opens it,
she'd get caught.

1656
02:07:52,500 --> 02:07:54,542
That's it!
This case is over.

1657
02:07:55,042 --> 02:07:57,167
Who played what, madam?

1658
02:07:58,792 --> 02:08:00,833
The truth will be buried
with Malar.

1659
02:08:08,583 --> 02:08:09,750
It's nothing.

1660
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:13,292
This is the biggest gamble
I've played in my life.

1661
02:08:13,833 --> 02:08:15,750
I went all in,
and I won.

1662
02:08:16,167 --> 02:08:18,292
Now I've lost the desire to gamble.

1663
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:22,167
Why did you help me?

1664
02:08:25,458 --> 02:08:27,500
You never liked mom.

1665
02:08:28,625 --> 02:08:30,792
But she never forgot you
till the very end.

1666
02:08:31,292 --> 02:08:33,375
If she bought me a shirt,
she'd buy one for you too.

1667
02:08:34,167 --> 02:08:36,042
She'd utter your name in her sleep
and cry.

1668
02:08:37,917 --> 02:08:41,042
If she were alive,
she'd have wanted me to help you.

1669
02:08:43,875 --> 02:08:45,250
I did it for mom.

1670
02:08:46,500 --> 02:08:47,583
Not for you.

1671
02:08:50,917 --> 02:08:52,125
I'm going to get married.

1672
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:54,292
The girl's name is Anandhi.

1673
02:08:55,875 --> 02:08:57,167
I'm starting a new life.

1674
02:08:59,458 --> 02:09:00,208
You?

1675
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:27,375
I have sold my properties.

1676
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,083
I'm going to Bombay.

1677
02:09:30,750 --> 02:09:32,000
And then to Copenhagen from there.

1678
02:09:33,958 --> 02:09:35,250
I don't intend to come back.

1679
02:09:36,583 --> 02:09:39,542
This is the last time
we'll be seeing each other.

1680
02:09:59,042 --> 02:10:05,750
'This scarred heart - flows like a stream;
It's an infinite dream.'

1681
02:10:06,042 --> 02:10:18,000
'Crashing against your wave...
I'm nothing but a reflection, my love.'

1682
02:10:19,292 --> 02:10:26,042
'This scarred heart - flows like a stream;
It's a restless dream.'

1683
02:10:26,375 --> 02:10:38,208
'In my sandy shorelines...
You're etched like footprints, my love.'

1684
02:10:38,917 --> 02:10:48,708
'With the smile I wear on my face;
And the tears I carry in my eyes.'

1685
02:10:48,875 --> 02:10:58,375
'My heart heavy with memories...
I walk ahead.'

1686
02:10:58,500 --> 02:11:06,167
'One day, you drenched me with your love.
Then why did you dry away so soon?'

1687
02:11:06,208 --> 02:11:07,708
Happy birthday!

1688
02:11:11,792 --> 02:11:13,167
I don't get a gift?

1689
02:11:21,208 --> 02:11:22,958
Shall I unwrap the gift?

1690
02:11:26,917 --> 02:11:30,167
If only I'd trusted my mom that day,
she wouldn't have died.

1691
02:11:32,667 --> 02:11:35,125
After all these years...
I'm able to understand her.

1692
02:11:36,542 --> 02:11:38,708
I want to apologise to her,
but she's not here.

1693
02:11:39,708 --> 02:11:48,917
'Aren't there flowers in this valley,
That will bloom just for me?'

1694
02:11:49,375 --> 02:11:59,500
'Aren't there clouds in the sky,
That will shower me with joy?'

1695
02:11:59,750 --> 02:12:09,792
'You made some dreams come true;
And you burst some bubbles, too.'

1696
02:12:09,875 --> 02:12:19,250
'Your loss being a searing pain,
You've taught me to fall and rise again.'

1697
02:12:22,375 --> 02:12:24,792
What will you do if I don't come back?

1698
02:12:29,917 --> 02:12:32,083
I'll be searching for you, all my life.

1699
02:13:07,458 --> 02:13:11,083
Akash's case is truly unique,
in this whole world.

1700
02:13:11,333 --> 02:13:12,625
There is no other case like it.

1701
02:13:12,708 --> 02:13:15,292
Not really. Such cases have happened
around the world.

1702
02:13:15,333 --> 02:13:16,667
Really?
- Yes, sir.

1703
02:13:16,708 --> 02:13:19,958
Malaysia, Nigeria, USA, Germany...

1704
02:16:17,417 --> 02:16:20,667
