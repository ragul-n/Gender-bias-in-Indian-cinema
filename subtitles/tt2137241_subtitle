1
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,260
Sinbad, the sailor sets sail...

2
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,450
I hope you remember our song
Sinbad the sailor

3
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,350
The sailor, who negotiates treacherous seas
and scours unchartered territories

4
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,600
Life is no less than Sinbad

5
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,880
Adi, Joe and I have come a long way
in the last few years

6
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:18,190
We as a group drifted apart with time,
meeting not so often

7
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,260
but we are still thick friends

8
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:42,310
Rock on!
It's the sign of the times

9
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,060
Rock on!
Every moment beckons you

10
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,060
Rock on!
What are you waiting for?

11
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:55,560
Rock on!
You won't get a second chance

12
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,310
Wow! What's your name?

13
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,310
Sir, I'm Mann Jyot. MJ from Barnala

14
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,450
Very nice.
- Thank you, sir

15
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,120
Joe, come in

16
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,170
This is a gold mine, Joe.
You have to rip this one apart. Okay?

17
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,400
Don't let him go.
This joker will help the TRPs rise

18
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,670
Sir,

19
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,510
I'm a fan, sir

20
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,190
Keep it at that.
Don't turn into a light-bulb

21
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,980
So what's your decision
for Mann Jyot aka MJ?

22
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,940
Your pitch is okay, not so great

23
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,530
But the entertainment factor is awesome

24
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,010
So it's a thumbs-up from me.
- Yeah!

25
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,690
MJ, congratulations.
And welcome to 'Sa Re Ga Ma Pa'

26
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,440
That's right.
That's our new

27
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,060
and financially improved Joseph Mascarenhas

28
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,940
A judge of a successful reality show

29
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,320
And a working partner
of this live music club, 12 Bar Blues

30
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,520
Hi.
- Hi

31
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,490
Hey, Joe!
- What's up?

32
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,260
I need your club this Friday night

33
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,960
My club is your club, sir. Any time!
- Thanks, Joe

34
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,830
You have to give me time
for this interview this Friday

35
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,540
Joe!

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,470
Tomorrow. I promise.
Call me

37
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,170
Promise?
- Promise. Drinks are on me

38
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,880
Okay. See you then.
- Sorry

39
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,310
Life has been good to Joe

40
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,570
But as his friend, it's my duty
never to stop pulling his leg

41
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,830
Good to see you

42
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,810
I think you should let Andy take over now

43
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,750
Or, you'll be labelled a silly old flirt.
- As if you're still a rose in bloom!

44
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,310
She's a journalist, she wants an interview.
It's a must, KD

45
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,640
It's called PR

46
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,530
Teaser, in other words!

47
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:50,090
Yep, that's me. KD.
Killer Drummer!

48
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,980
I come from a family of jewellers

49
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,410
But I dumped the profession to follow
my passion, my first love... Music

50
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,910
Sounds good, right?

51
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,020
Hang on!
Stop

52
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,940
Stop it, please

53
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,320
What's this?
What type of music is this?

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,180
It's electro-rock

55
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,900
So you made this...?
- Electric Rock, sir

56
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,850
Right!

57
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,830
The point is, you haven't followed
our creative brief well

58
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:22,130
At times, when we try to sell our music
to complete idiots,

59
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,270
these kinds of problems crop up

60
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,040
Can't help it though!

61
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,490
You can't just give up
and bury yourself in some godforsaken place

62
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,730
like Adi did

63
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,320
For several years now, he's been living
in a small village in Meghalaya

64
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,220
All by himself

65
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,190
Hello?

66
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,190
Hello, Mr Adi?
Have you listened to my CD?

67
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,060
Rahul!

68
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,690
Rahul...!

69
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,530
The truth is, Adi is trying to run away
not from us

70
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,390
or from anyone

71
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,730
but from a memory,
or perhaps from himself

72
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,770
Good morning

73
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,940
Here

74
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,190
Bye

75
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,390
Jana!

76
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,360
Adi had created another world,
away from his own

77
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,400
A Cooperative Centre, for farmers

78
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,310
A school, for children

79
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,980
He had turned the place around completely

80
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,750
How are you, Paya?

81
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,490
Adi...
- Baioman

82
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,790
I've got some food for you

83
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,690
You get food for me every day!
Please sit

84
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,980
Nice.
You too

85
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,830
The memory that Adi wanted to forget,

86
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,350
we were about to relive it!

87
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,030
And Jiah would be the reason

88
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,790
But Jiah herself
had no clue about it then

89
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,500
Father,

90
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,980
the boy is here again

91
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,500
Sir, I'm Uday Brijkishore Mishra

92
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,190
I've been trying to meet you
since the last two months

93
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:55,960
Mr Sehgal from the Hindi University
was my teacher

94
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,410
He sent you a letter...

95
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,750
I received it

96
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,100
Mr Sehgal speaks highly of you

97
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,110
But I've quit

98
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,100
both, sarod and music

99
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:19,590
My grandfather was a simple postmaster
in Lucknow

100
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,100
He held you in high regards

101
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,690
His dying wish

102
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,570
was to see me present
my musical talent before you, once

103
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,240
Please give me a chance, sir

104
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,650
Raga Khamaj

105
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,690
was my brother's favourite

106
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,060
I'm sorry!

107
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,860
I had no idea

108
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,310
Listen

109
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,810
Will you do me a favour?

110
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,440
Did you compose it?

111
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,370
Fantastic song

112
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,940
Thank you

113
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,610
I wanted to record a sarod track.
Would you?

114
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,800
Don't do this

115
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,480
What do you mean?

116
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,420
You are making it up to me
for Pandit-ji's indifference

117
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,760
Listen

118
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,770
My music has nothing to do with him

119
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,230
He has no idea what I am up to
in this garage

120
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,460
But if you don't want to play, then don't

121
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,010
It's okay

122
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,850
Nothing of the sort

123
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,760
I thought you were...

124
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,870
It's okay

125
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,540
And don't be so formal

126
00:11:58,830 --> 00:11:59,950
Jiah

127
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:06,180
Fine. But when you perform this on stage,
don't forget me

128
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,650
Stage? No freaking way!

129
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,440
I just do it for fun... it's just a hobby

130
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,690
It's a strange world

131
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,960
You can get a break in the music industry
anytime you want

132
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,260
And I, on the other hand,
am tired of running from pillar to post

133
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,130
I'm completely broke

134
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,690
I'm confident,

135
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,560
you will soon stop running around

136
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,110
Let's take it from the start

137
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,810
When Uday walked into Joe's music club
with that CD,

138
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,790
neither he nor we had a clue

139
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,750
that it wasn't just a CD
but a key

140
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,370
that'd open all the closed doors someday,

141
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:26,960
behind which lay many bitter memories
that Adi wished to forget

142
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,560
Yes?

143
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,320
Mr Aditya,

144
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,310
I'm Mahendra Nongrum

145
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,850
I'm sure you know me

146
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,910
President of the Farmer's Welfare Board

147
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,780
I had no idea they had
a Farmer's Welfare Board here

148
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,540
Oh, you wouldn't know.
You never attend meetings

149
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,610
Neither do you cooperate with us.
- Hello

150
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,210
What do you want from us?

151
00:13:58,730 --> 00:13:59,810
You see,

152
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:06,060
you face problems
when you sell directly in the market

153
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,160
Sorry... not problems

154
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,190
Confusion!

155
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,560
It creates confusion

156
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,060
That is why I have an offer for you

157
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:20,060
Sell your produce to us

158
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,060
We'll give you a good price

159
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:28,870
Mr Mahendra, you sell
at a very higher rate than we do

160
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,020
but the villagers don't profit from it

161
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,400
We sell it cheaper, true

162
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,330
But the ten villages
in the folds of our Cooperative

163
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,910
have profited much in two years

164
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,240
So, I'm sorry,
I have to turn down your offer

165
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,980
Sorry

166
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,120
Fine

167
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,080
As you wish.
- Thank you

168
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:24,800
Hello?

169
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:28,980
Hello?

170
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,190
Hello?
- My motherland...

171
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,260
Oh, my God!
KD!

172
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,060
The fertile soil of my country
reaps treasures

173
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,480
Surprise!
- My motherland...

174
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,760
Happy birthday, farmer!
Hail the farmer!

175
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,520
Happy birthday!

176
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,130
Happy birthday!

177
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,940
Oh, my God!

178
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:04,310
And here's your birthday gift.
A brand new spade

179
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,440
Thank you very much.
- I can't handle him

180
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,690
Please come back soon

181
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,060
He's losing his senses in your memories

182
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,850
I'll fix him right away.
Take that!

183
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,120
Who am I?
- Right!

184
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,870
Where are we? Who are you?
- I can't handle him!

185
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,450
Oh, God!
- How are you?

186
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,080
I'm good. How is Rob? Where's he?
- In the car, sleeping

187
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,310
He's here?
- Yes

188
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,440
Wow! A return gift

189
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,380
We can't take him along, please!
- No!

190
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,630
No, please!

191
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,100
Passed out

192
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,390
Happy birthday, dad!
- Hey!

193
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,750
Thank you, darling

194
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,340
I think he's terribly sleepy.
Can we take him inside?

195
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:55,800
You mean, we'll have to wait outside
till we get drowsy?

196
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,100
Wow, Sakshi! What a good host!
Too good

197
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,380
Shut up, KD.
- Why shut-up? Am I not right?

198
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,020
Sleep well, champ

199
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,330
For the ladies.
- Thank you

200
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,950
Andy didn't come along?

201
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,900
'Teenagers don't party
with their parents, mom! It's so uncool!'

202
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,120
Happy birthday, Adi!
- Thank you, Joe

203
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,370
Happy birthday!
- Cheers, guys

204
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,990
Cheers!
- Cheers!

205
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,100
Cheers!

206
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,950
But I wish he came

207
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,960
It's a good change for all of us

208
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,150
The fresh air, the calm

209
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:42,580
Really, man.
Had you written 'Socha Hai' here,

210
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,280
the silence would've gone unheard

211
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,800
Hey, KD!

212
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,970
Put it away, please

213
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,150
Please!
- Why hide it from us?

214
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,200
Or, is there something fishy?

215
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,700
Nothing fishy, but it's really not cool.
Please put it down

216
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,530
Why worry then?

217
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,200
Well, it's interesting!

218
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,100
Buy fertilisers

219
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,250
Fix the boundary fence

220
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,200
Lubricate the machines

221
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:16,010
Sorry. I never intended
to expose you before them

222
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,060
I'm afraid to explore more!

223
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,700
'Boil the eggs, iron the shirt...'

224
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,720
Oh, what's this?

225
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,490
Let's go someplace

226
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,450
There's no dearth of paths

227
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,890
Let's go where our heart takes us to

228
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,450
Nice

229
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,770
Have you composed a tune?

230
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,380
Beautiful, Adi. Let's hear.
- Now?

231
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,480
Yes!
- Yeah, come on

232
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,530
Of course.
- Yeah! Let's go

233
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,270
Put that down, please

234
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,830
Bass, please

235
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,220
All right.
- Joe, all yours

236
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:58,240
Should I play something?
- Yes, the spade

237
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,670
Not bad, Joe

238
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,780
Debbie is going to France,
and your sense of humour is getting better

239
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,900
Look, that's for you

240
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,520
The shaker!

241
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,500
The song is in E

242
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,850
Come in whenever you're ready

243
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,140
Come, let's go someplace

244
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,290
Come, there's no dearth of paths

245
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,130
Come, let's go

246
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,230
where our heart takes us

247
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,330
Every moment, at every step,

248
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,450
we will find

249
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,140
new destinations

250
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,950
Every moment, at every step,

251
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,270
we will find

252
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:02,450
new destinations

253
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,100
Come, let's get on the roads

254
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,950
Let's explore new things

255
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,930
Don't stop, don't be tired

256
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,020
Let's just continue on our journey

257
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,760
Every moment, at every step,

258
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,880
we will find new destinations

259
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,880
Every moment, at every step,

260
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,080
we will find

261
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,970
new destinations

262
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:07,410
No one understands

263
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,080
the turmoil within

264
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,110
Who knows where
we'll find ourselves tomorrow

265
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,120
For the present still remains unexplained

266
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,270
So listen to the call

267
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,950
of the heart

268
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,080
Time

269
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,270
is fast fading away

270
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,090
Every moment, at every step,

271
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,740
we will find new destinations

272
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,950
Come, let's go someplace

273
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,290
There's no dearth of paths

274
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,910
Come, let's go

275
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,830
where our heart takes us

276
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,080
Every moment, at every step,

277
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:08,080
we will find new destinations

278
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,830
Every moment, at every step,

279
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:18,540
we will find new destinations

280
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,200
Good you quit the city

281
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,640
Why don't you construct another room?
I'll move in with you

282
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,600
What a great idea!
Accommodate him here please, Adi

283
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,700
Seriously!
I'm bored of playing ball with the clients

284
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,510
But Joe, I don't understand something

285
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,740
Why don't you take time off
to play music?

286
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,070
How?

287
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:51,720
Between managing the club and shooting
for the show, I hardly find time

288
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,760
Hear the excuses of Mr Moneybags!

289
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,330
Not excuses, KD. That's my job

290
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,560
By the way, who is stopping you
from making music?

291
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,190
Why don't you form a band

292
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,910
with your new friends, those kids,
who perform at my club?

293
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,050
It'll remind you of your heydays

294
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,390
Very funny!

295
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,450
Tell me something

296
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:22,310
Last night, we played together;

297
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,290
did you feel good or not?

298
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,080
Did you feel anything?

299
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:29,580
There's no point anyway.
He is chasing another career,

300
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,950
while you are running away from your past

301
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,700
Shut up, KD.
- Let him speak

302
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,370
What are you trying to say?
Should I forget what happened?

303
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,700
Who told you to forget it?

304
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:46,290
But for what happened,
why do you hold yourself responsible?

305
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,720
That's enough, KD

306
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,920
Why enough, Joe?
- Come on

307
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,120
Old habits die hard

308
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:55,200
Every time there's a problem in his life,
he gives up and escapes

309
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,950
Yes, I gave up!

310
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,940
We set up a music label
to encourage new talent. To what end?

311
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:06,000
Nothing! We lost a lot of money,
and a poor boy killed himself!

312
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:07,630
That's what happened, KD!
- Ignore him, Adi

313
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,310
It's the truth, Joe

314
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:13,550
Every time I tried to make music,
I've hurt someone!

315
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,090
Please!

316
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,500
What please?

317
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,900
Do you have answers for everything?

318
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,670
Answer me then

319
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,580
What are you supposed to do when you see
no hope in a relationship? Tell me

320
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,970
No hope?

321
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,950
If you can't see any hope, what the heck
are you playing guitar here for?

322
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,650
Why are you writing songs
in your red diary?

323
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,020
Because you desperately need a new start!
Isn't that it?

324
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,290
This is a new start, KD!

325
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:44,600
This farm, this Cooperative
...isn't that something?

326
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,450
What else do you expect me to do?

327
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,540
To go back to Mumbai?
And do what?

328
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,930
Sing to the tunes of clients with you?

329
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:54,260
Or, judge a reality show like him?
I'm not freaking interested

330
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,220
Whoa!
What did you say, Adi?

331
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,260
Judge a reality show like me, eh?

332
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,880
Am I doing something wrong?

333
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:06,520
It's easy for you to say that.
You guys never had to worry about money!

334
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:11,010
You never have to bother about
the next cheque, whether it comes or not!

335
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,330
And you guys are trying to judge me!

336
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,200
Go ahead, man!

337
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,580
We know that, Joe

338
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,860
Please trust me, I'm not judging you

339
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,010
Your success makes us happy the most

340
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,580
However, the fact remains that
we've chosen different paths

341
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,330
So what's the problem in it?
And what's his problem?

342
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,700
Hey guys!

343
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,790
Come on!

344
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,100
Perfect

345
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,880
I need a break.
- Take a long one

346
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,000
Look Adi,

347
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,220
if you are happy here,
I'm happy for you

348
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,380
Forget it

349
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,430
It's your birthday

350
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,610
Rob, are you going into the water?

351
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,790
Yes

352
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:25,770
Wow!

353
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,390
This is stunning!

354
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,890
My God!

355
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,910
They'll never grow up!

356
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,800
You know what?
We shouldn't either!

357
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,850
Debbie...?

358
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,450
Today was fun!

359
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,010
Do you really have to leave tomorrow?

360
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,340
Yes

361
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,510
Rob has to submit his art project
in school on Monday

362
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,330
Even I have meetings

363
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,400
I really wish both of you move in here

364
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,450
What will I do here, Adi?

365
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,120
Rob goes to school now.
So I get time to do my tasks

366
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,480
I'm going to miss you both

367
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,150
Why don't you come back, Adi?

368
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,210
I have to pack

369
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,450
So I should just...

370
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,800
Good night, Adi

371
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,630
Remember your promise?
- Yes

372
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,350
What was your promise?

373
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,170
I'll watch TV
only on Saturdays and Sundays

374
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,280
Very good

375
00:28:56,290 --> 00:29:00,660
And I've promised to go camping with you
during the next holidays, right?

376
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,750
Bye, dad.
- Bye

377
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,570
Hey! Bring it back in one piece

378
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,950
I can't hear you

379
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,090
Bring it back in one piece!

380
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,720
Don't worry.
Your motorcycle and I will return

381
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:19,490
in one piece, after three days!
All right?

382
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,210
See you guys. Bye.
- Ride safe

383
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,550
Get out of here!

384
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,860
Thanks, buddy.
See you soon

385
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,450
Bye.
- Let's go

386
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,100
How I wish we could bring back
the good old days, in one piece!

387
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:35,820
The days when music
meant everything to Magik

388
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,200
Everything!

389
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,440
You know what I mean!

390
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:51,290
Listen to me, let's meet again

391
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,800
Let's meet at the same place

392
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,900
One, two, three, four!

393
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:17,780
Listen to me, let's meet again

394
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,070
Let's meet at the same place

395
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,440
We'll catch a movie if you feel like it

396
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:27,900
Or, we'll chit-chat over coffee

397
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:31,190
Your likes, your wishes,

398
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,110
your memories, you can share with me

399
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,940
When I hear you speak,
I lose my senses

400
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,860
I don't know why

401
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,840
You know what I mean

402
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,480
You know what I mean

403
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,190
Don't ask me about my Ex,

404
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,980
where I even met her

405
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:05,340
Forget it, don't ask me

406
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,780
You are the only one in my life now

407
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,030
Now that I've found you,

408
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,940
all my wishes are granted

409
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,780
When I hear you speak,
I just go bonkers

410
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,570
I don't know why

411
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,440
You know what I mean

412
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,400
You know what I mean

413
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:55,980
Your style, enchanting

414
00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:02,940
Your voice, silken

415
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,190
When I hear you speak,
it just makes me desperate

416
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,400
I don't know why

417
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,280
You know what I mean

418
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,190
You know what I mean

419
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,610
You know what I mean

420
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,160
Will those days ever come back?

421
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,900
I hope so

422
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,690
Even now when Adi, Joe and I
make music sometimes,

423
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,330
we feel like the birds flying in the sky,

424
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,750
free and blissful

425
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:08,250
But just as the bird returns to its nest
at the end of the day,

426
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,420
after we left,

427
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:14,130
Adi's life returned
to its haunting memories

428
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:42,560
I'm Rahul.
I called your office several times

429
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:45,140
I wanted to give you my CD, in person

430
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,330
Here? In the washroom?

431
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:54,030
I was waiting for you at the club
but you seemed busy

432
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,490
Then I saw you coming here,
so I thought...

433
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:59,500
Please listen to it...
some of my compositions

434
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,520
Why don't you get your CD

435
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,930
to my office tomorrow morning?

436
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,070
I'll hear it out

437
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,370
Adi...
- Bah Sing?

438
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Adi... fire!

439
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,120
Fire!

440
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:28,510
Someone help! Fire!

441
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,520
Help!

442
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,460
Help!

443
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:55,550
My baby!
Save my baby!

444
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,120
Jana!

445
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,170
Jana!
- No, Adi!

446
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,460
The wild fire raged

447
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:21,510
till it completely razed all the houses
and five years of Adi's hardwork

448
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,630
The school, the Cooperative Centre,
everything...

449
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:28,010
everything was reduced to ashes

450
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,850
There comes a point in one's life

451
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,640
when he has no idea where he is headed

452
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,680
It was during one such phase
that Adi happened to meet Jiah

453
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:10,120
Meeting, if you could call it one

454
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:32,300
Jiah perhaps related to the pain
and despair in his eyes

455
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:39,460
Only the broken-hearted
hear the cries of a heart rent

456
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,530
Hello...?

457
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,560
Excuse me

458
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,650
Are you all right?

459
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:32,190
I hope you aren't planning to jump...?

460
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,150
Look,

461
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,520
whatever may be your problem,

462
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,620
this is not the solution

463
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:09,530
I'm sorry

464
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:22,560
Oh, crap!

465
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,040
Oh, crap!

466
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,090
Help!

467
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,360
Somebody help me!

468
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:31,960
Help!

469
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:46,990
Adi!

470
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:52,110
Darn! You had me scared!

471
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:55,630
We've been looking for you
since last evening. Come on, get up

472
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,360
Where am I?
- Cherrapunji

473
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,220
Thanks, guys

474
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,330
Are you missing something?

475
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,320
No, nothing

476
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:19,110
Come, get in the car

477
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:25,490
Luckily I was there
when Adi came around

478
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,050
Bah Sing and I reasoned with him,

479
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:32,450
while Sakshi and Joe pressurised him
over the phone

480
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:37,150
Finally, somehow we compelled him
to come back to Mumbai

481
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,710
Bah Sing, I have transferred some money
to your account

482
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,530
I will manage, Adi

483
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:56,790
Besides, the government has announced
a relief package

484
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:00,780
for the villagers.
We should get it soon

485
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:02,540
That's good

486
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,570
Call me if you need something

487
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:08,030
Adi...
- Bye

488
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,920
Good to see you.
- How are you?

489
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,550
Sorry, I couldn't make it to the airport

490
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:18,860
It's okay.
- Was it Bah Sing?

491
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,170
Is all well?

492
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,110
I hope so

493
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,450
I know, Adi, this must be
really hard on you

494
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:30,240
but what's done is done

495
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,280
You have to move on

496
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:37,020
Move on?
Easier said than done, Joe

497
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,990
I know.
But you have to try, buddy

498
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:43,010
How long can we see you like this?

499
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:45,600
You know we love you, man

500
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:47,170
Yeah

501
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:53,070
I was telling Joe, we should be meeting
at the studio for a few days

502
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,200
Let's make music

503
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,820
We can also record your new song

504
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:00,170
It'll be a good change

505
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:02,530
What do you say?

506
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,410
Okay.
- Cool

507
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,070
Great

508
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,430
We'll be there

509
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,540
What is it, Mr Uday?
You look thrilled

510
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,450
You'll also be excited to know

511
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,990
Tell me then

512
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:29,570
I had sent our CD to 12 Bar Blues

513
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,000
They've called us over

514
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:34,360
What for?

515
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:36,240
To play music, what else?

516
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,060
What?

517
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:43,580
Joe Mascarenhas' club
has live music show...

518
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:45,830
What are you saying, Uday?

519
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:50,890
I told you!
I don't want to do live performances!

520
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:56,420
You didn't bother to ask me
before sending them our tracks?

521
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,420
It could be a big break for me, Jiah

522
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,530
No! No!
I am not up for this

523
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,460
I don't even know them.
Why should I let them hear my track?

524
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:09,340
You want to do that?
Here... go ahead

525
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:22,160
Tell me something

526
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,430
What are you scared of?

527
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:28,280
We compose music
for others to hear, right?

528
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:37,760
I'm at my wit's end,
and I don't have a penny to boot

529
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,530
I've been trying my luck everywhere

530
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,110
How long can I keep knocking
on closed doors, Jiah?

531
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,280
Let's go

532
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,400
Vaayu! They sounded different

533
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,560
Remember?
- Yeah

534
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:01,700
Where's their lead singer these days, Joe?

535
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,400
I wasn't his manager

536
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,530
Sir, Mr Uday is here

537
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,740
Wow! Ask him to set it up on the stage.
We'll see him there

538
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:13,360
Sure, sir.
- Thanks

539
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:17,170
I've heard their demo tape.
I think you should also hear it

540
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:18,840
Do I have a choice, KD?

541
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:22,440
Have you listened to my CD?

542
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,780
You are...?
- Rahul

543
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,610
We met at the club

544
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,900
The washroom guy!

545
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:32,340
Do you stay in this building?

546
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:33,740
No

547
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,340
Actually, it's been a month
since I gave you the CD

548
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,230
I called your office several times,
in vain

549
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:41,300
I'm sorry,
I had to surprise you like this

550
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,100
Look Rahul, I will listen to your CD

551
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,940
But to sneak into the building
like this... it's not cool

552
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:50,450
Right.
When will you listen to it?

553
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:52,610
When I find time

554
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,040
Can someone be so busy?

555
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,150
I'm sorry, my schedule doesn't suit you

556
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,400
So just relax.
- You've been ignoring me for a month now

557
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,030
And you tell me to relax?

558
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,380
KD speaks highly of your music

559
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:17,010
Thank you, sir

560
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,710
She wrote the song, so...
- Really?

561
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,300
It's very good

562
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:27,450
You...?

563
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:30,660
Do you know each other?

564
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:32,960
Wow! Small world

565
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:35,030
How come?

566
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,200
I was in Cherrapunji
to record a local band

567
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:44,620
That's where we met

568
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,840
Let's hear something

569
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:50,720
Of course.
The keyboard is on the stage

570
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:52,530
And you've got your sarod

571
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:54,350
Come on, let's hear something

572
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:55,570
Now?

573
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,000
Yes. Now

574
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:59,460
We've heard your demo CD

575
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:02,330
Let's see how you perform live

576
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,240
Come on.
I'll set it up for you

577
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,410
Come on, Ms Jiah. Your first
live performance is waiting for you

578
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:13,930
Jay, turn the lights on

579
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,370
My heart's a bit broken,

580
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,780
so is yours

581
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:36,330
I feel bitter,

582
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:39,120
so do you

583
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:45,370
My heart's a bit broken,

584
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,620
so is yours

585
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,530
I feel bitter,

586
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:51,990
so do you

587
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:56,280
I wonder why it is so

588
00:48:56,870 --> 00:49:00,370
Why is the heart so inexplicable?

589
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,870
Should we just remain strangers?

590
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:07,000
It is a predicament,

591
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:11,080
for you as well as me

592
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:15,870
All our stories

593
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:21,200
remain unfinished, untold

594
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:24,990
How will they find closure?

595
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:31,170
I guess we should
think about it sometime

596
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:42,410
I'm lonely, so are you

597
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:46,570
So, why don't we travel together?

598
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:51,240
The feeling that resonates
in our hearts,

599
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:55,150
why can't we bring it to our lips?

600
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:57,240
You are silent,

601
00:49:57,850 --> 00:49:59,350
so am I

602
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:03,750
Confused and restless,
that's what we are

603
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,950
You are silent,

604
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,030
so am I

605
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:15,550
All our stories

606
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:20,780
remain unfinished, untold

607
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:24,870
How will they find closure?

608
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:30,160
I guess we should
think about it sometime

609
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:41,500
Cool, guys. If you have more compositions,
please feel free

610
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,520
to perform here, anytime

611
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:46,870
I don't know.
I just came here for Uday

612
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,330
So Uday, tell us if you have more songs

613
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:52,710
Jiah is the one who writes

614
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:54,610
So let's hear it, Ms Jiah

615
00:50:55,120 --> 00:51:00,490
This is the only song that is complete,
the rest are incomplete;

616
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:02,700
not worth performing on stage

617
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:04,330
No problem

618
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:06,970
We'll work together
on those incomplete tunes

619
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:09,660
I think we'll just need a guitarist

620
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:12,280
I do have a friend, retired though

621
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:15,280
Let's see.
Never lose hope!

622
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,170
What say, Joe?
- KD...

623
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:18,990
See? He is on!
Thanks, buddy

624
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,410
And you, Adi?

625
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:21,740
Me...? No!

626
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:23,180
Come on!
- No, no!

627
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,670
Didn't you like the song?

628
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,910
Nothing of the sort.
I loved the song

629
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:34,490
But the new band has a lead singer,
so I'm not needed

630
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:37,120
All the best

631
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:40,670
All right then, let's start on Saturday

632
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,700
Tomorrow is Saturday

633
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:46,410
So, no problem...
- When it comes to music,

634
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:49,150
our friend here gets rather excited.
Right?

635
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,930
Absolutely right. I'm always excited
when it comes to music

636
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:57,370
Love is in the air

637
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:01,850
Without you,

638
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:05,760
there was no excitement, no desire

639
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:09,570
Now that I've found you,

640
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:13,230
I've got a new lease of life

641
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:23,540
There must be a star,

642
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:30,140
with a world of its own...

643
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:37,230
Don't mind me.
Please play

644
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,380
No...

645
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:41,610
I came early for the rehearsals,
so I thought I'd...

646
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:44,060
May I join you?

647
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:49,570
Play

648
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,070
Somewhere in the realms,

649
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:04,560
of the vast blue skies,

650
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:12,420
there must be a star

651
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:21,080
with a world of its own

652
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:27,070
brimming with life

653
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:33,700
A world, so different from ours,

654
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:37,610
not a shard of pain to endure

655
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:43,660
A world where life is not painful

656
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:48,720
That's all there is

657
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,570
It's very good

658
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:53,660
Thank you

659
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:04,940
Thank you

660
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:09,710
For what you did back in Cherrapunji

661
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:13,000
I don't know what I would've done
if not for you

662
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:17,620
You needed help, and I was around

663
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:20,530
I couldn't think of anything else.
- Still

664
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:24,050
Very few people
lend a helping hand to others

665
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:28,320
So, thanks

666
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:32,070
What were you doing there anyway?

667
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:36,320
I visit Meghalaya quite often

668
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:38,640
To record the folk singers

669
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:43,860
May I ask you something?

670
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:47,850
Why are you scared to perform on stage?

671
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:53,660
No... it's not like that

672
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:59,660
It's probably because I'm going
to perform for the first time

673
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:04,540
You have a beautiful voice, Jiah

674
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:08,730
And your notes
express your innermost feelings

675
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,610
You're really good

676
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:11,730
Hello

677
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,600
Sorry, we're late

678
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,880
Do you also play bass guitar, Uday?

679
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:22,260
Well... Joe sir said
since I play the sarod well...!

680
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,740
So I'm practising

681
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:24,850
Good

682
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:27,480
Enjoy your rehearsals

683
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,350
Best of luck for your song

684
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:32,710
Thank you

685
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,810
Bye

686
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:36,150
Bye.
- See you, Adi

687
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,680
See you during the performance tonight.
- Yeah. See you

688
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:45,880
Yes, Uday. I'm leaving now

689
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:47,830
Yeah, I'll see you soon. Bye

690
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,280
Jiah

691
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:53,490
Yes, father...?

692
00:55:54,910 --> 00:55:56,400
Where are you going?

693
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:00,350
Father, my college friend, Malini...

694
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:03,220
It's her birthday. I'm going over

695
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:06,370
All right. Don't be late

696
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:19,070
Is this what you call music?

697
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:23,430
You are destroying the sanctity of music

698
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,280
by playing the guitar and piano along

699
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:30,660
I'm ashamed to call you my son!

700
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:32,270
Jiah

701
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:35,160
Ready? Let's go

702
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:40,310
So many people are here
to watch the New Magik!

703
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:45,250
It doesn't feel right

704
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:50,710
What doesn't feel right?

705
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,010
What if my father finds out?

706
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,330
How will he find out, Jiah?

707
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:00,060
He'll be really furious

708
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:03,000
Now look, we're performing in ten minutes!

709
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:05,360
Don't worry.
- Guys, are you ready?

710
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:09,550
Let's go

711
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,050
Let's do this

712
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:13,190
And good luck

713
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,390
Rock on, dad!

714
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:27,910
Let's hear it for Jiah!

715
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:10,920
It's okay, Jiah.
You can start again

716
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,150
Adi, what's going on?

717
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:17,550
Start again

718
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,320
Jiah!

719
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:24,850
Play... play your song

720
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:31,030
Play your song, Jiah

721
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,970
I'll be right back

722
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,400
Give me a beat

723
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,010
Jiah, are you okay?

724
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:20,680
What happened?
- I can't do this

725
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:22,270
I can't do this!

726
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:23,820
What is it, Jiah?

727
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:25,530
My father will be mad!

728
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,100
Sorry?

729
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,900
My father will be furious

730
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,530
I don't understand what you're saying.
Just relax

731
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:33,810
Let me go!

732
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:48,440
I told you, they are novices,
they are not ready!

733
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:51,520
Crap! Crap!

734
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:55,770
I don't know
why I even listen to him!

735
00:59:57,190 --> 01:00:00,810
He's always droning
about making music, performing!

736
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,240
Is this it?

737
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:05,500
Is this your New Magik?

738
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:08,590
This rubbish?

739
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:11,270
Come on, Joe. It happens

740
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:14,600
Even great musicians fumble on stage

741
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:15,710
Look, Adi,

742
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:19,460
a lot of crap goes between
managing my club and my reality show

743
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:22,360
But when it comes to music,
I can't take this!

744
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:25,480
This rubbish KD drama!

745
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,640
Joe, how was I to know
Jiah would have a stage fright?

746
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:31,530
KD, why don't you just...?

747
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:38,820
And you!

748
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:40,570
Come here

749
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:43,010
What were you thinking on the stage?

750
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:45,320
What were you thinking?

751
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:50,060
If you want to play in a band,
you should learn to be a part of it

752
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,750
Sir... I cracked

753
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:55,400
Jiah missed her entry twice,
so I thought...

754
01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:56,700
What did you think?

755
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:58,600
That it was your solo performance?

756
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:00,100
Take it easy, Joe

757
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:01,790
Take it easy, man

758
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,530
I'll take it easy, Adi

759
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,080
Reason with that girl

760
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:10,670
Where does she stay?

761
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,170
Where does she stay?

762
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:14,480
Sir, please don't go to her place!

763
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:17,360
Her father doesn't know about
her live performance

764
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:19,840
Now where did her father
transpire out of?

765
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,080
Hang on, Joe

766
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:23,980
What's with her father?

767
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:27,970
Pandit Vibhuti

768
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:32,470
She's Pandit-ji's daughter

769
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:37,030
His son killed himself five years ago,

770
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:39,540
so he quit music

771
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:41,760
Jiah didn't want to perform
in the first place

772
01:01:58,750 --> 01:01:59,820
Rahul is...?

773
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:02,490
Jiah is Rahul's sister...?

774
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:20,770
No one knew,

775
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:25,270
after all these years,
life would drag Adi back to the point

776
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,740
he was trying to run away from

777
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:32,500
The memory now shadowed him

778
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:35,560
Can you ditch your shadow, ever?

779
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,390
I must tell her the truth

780
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:44,930
Adi, you are right

781
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:47,520
We'll go with you

782
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:49,140
What?

783
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,600
I'm not going!

784
01:02:58,310 --> 01:02:59,180
Joe,

785
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:00,660
come on, please

786
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,060
Please what, KD?
Please what?

787
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:08,510
After what happened tonight, you want me
to go to her house and apologise to her?

788
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,640
Rahul killed himself!

789
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:12,970
It wasn't our fault!

790
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:16,080
And that's that!

791
01:03:23,330 --> 01:03:26,120
The two of you may do as you please

792
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:28,360
I won't be a part of it

793
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,100
I'm done with this rubbish!

794
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:54,310
Rise

795
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:59,240
Rise

796
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,760
Don't let old practices stop you

797
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:26,540
Don't bow before customs and traditions

798
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:31,190
Rise! Break those shackles

799
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:35,260
Wipe it off...
rewrite your own destiny

800
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,800
Don't let old practices stop you

801
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:02,170
Don't bow before customs and traditions

802
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:06,710
Rise! Break those shackles

803
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:11,300
Wipe it off...
rewrite your own destiny

804
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:14,840
Let them know you

805
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:19,090
Let them admire you,
let them know who you are

806
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:21,540
Rise now

807
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:23,650
Let them know you

808
01:05:23,910 --> 01:05:28,160
Let them admire you,
let them know what you are made of

809
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:37,580
Rise

810
01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:42,540
Rise

811
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,120
If you think you're lacking somewhere,
you are wrong

812
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:18,870
If you're not granted your rights,
then you're being conned

813
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,370
Equality is the need of the hour

814
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:27,790
Let the world know that

815
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:30,950
Let them know you

816
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:35,450
Let them admire you,
let them know who you are

817
01:06:36,790 --> 01:06:37,790
Rise now

818
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,910
Let them know you

819
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:44,330
Let them admire you,
let them know what you are made of

820
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:54,120
Rise

821
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:58,580
Rise

822
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:39,240
Your life,

823
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:44,160
live it the way you want

824
01:07:44,950 --> 01:07:48,570
Every joy in the world

825
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:53,110
is meant for you

826
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:57,400
So what if it is a night of agony?

827
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:02,700
The darkness is about to be dispelled

828
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:06,450
If we are together,

829
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:12,650
we will usher in a new dawn one day

830
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:23,820
Rise

831
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:28,150
Rise

832
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:58,940
Let them know you

833
01:08:59,190 --> 01:09:03,190
Let them admire you,
let them know what you are made of

834
01:09:22,730 --> 01:09:26,030
Magik! Magik!

835
01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:31,950
Magik!
- All the best, guys

836
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:34,150
Magik! Magik!

837
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:37,060
Oh, God! He's come again.
- We're friends! I just want to talk

838
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:39,340
I just want to talk.
They know me!

839
01:09:39,450 --> 01:09:41,450
Hey! Hello!

840
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,230
Let me go.
- Let him come

841
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:44,890
Wow!

842
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:48,140
So that was Magik's
cutting edge music, eh?

843
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:50,980
Rise!

844
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:53,480
Rise!

845
01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:55,220
Take it easy

846
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:58,730
Rahul, you've had one too many

847
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:00,480
You should go

848
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:02,730
You remember my name!

849
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,520
Wow!

850
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,600
It feels great to hear that, you know!

851
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:12,030
But Mr Adi, you couldn't take
some time off to listen to my CD?

852
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:15,810
Fine, I'll do that. Okay?

853
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:18,280
I'll call you after I've heard it.
All right?

854
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:20,350
You're staving me off me again!

855
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:22,120
As usual!

856
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:26,670
You know, I came to you with high hopes

857
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:30,100
But you guys don't even have a moment!

858
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:32,350
You are busy making your own music!

859
01:10:33,010 --> 01:10:34,890
Rise!

860
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:38,640
Ri... rise!

861
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:42,520
Buddy, you don't like the song,
that's all right

862
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:45,810
No one is forcing you
to listen to our songs anyway

863
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:50,240
Go someplace and listen to your own CD.
I'm sure you'll like it

864
01:10:50,770 --> 01:10:52,400
Of course, I will like it

865
01:10:53,130 --> 01:10:54,630
Know what? I know my music!

866
01:10:54,770 --> 01:10:56,230
Good. Great!
- I know

867
01:10:56,430 --> 01:10:58,300
I was born in a world of music

868
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,430
Do you know my father?

869
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:02,010
Wow!

870
01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:05,400
I thought one gets to hear that line
only in movies

871
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:07,540
Laugh all you want

872
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:09,270
Even my father does that

873
01:11:09,470 --> 01:11:13,470
But if I get just one chance
to showcase my talent,

874
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:17,180
then I'd love to watch your expressions,
and his

875
01:11:18,490 --> 01:11:19,490
Rahul,

876
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:23,400
you're drunk. And you should go

877
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:25,630
Okay?

878
01:11:26,090 --> 01:11:28,470
Why? Why do you hate me so?

879
01:11:29,070 --> 01:11:30,190
Why?

880
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:33,990
Why don't you understand?
Even I want to make it big

881
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:36,940
It sounds so typical;

882
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:39,840
'Get lost!
Is this some music?'

883
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:42,790
'Is this what you call music?
I don't have time for ridiculous stuff'

884
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:45,720
You know how it feels to be rejected?
- Hey, enough!

885
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:47,510
Take him away!
- Do you even know?

886
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,060
Take him away! Enough now!
- I'm going

887
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:51,720
Go!
- I'm going

888
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,380
I'm going

889
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:56,840
Rise!

890
01:11:57,710 --> 01:11:58,840
Rise!

891
01:11:59,010 --> 01:12:00,130
Rise!

892
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:01,820
What is wrong with you?

893
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:04,760
Forget me, no one can help you,
you freaking psycho!

894
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:06,070
And get this!

895
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:08,010
Stop stalking me!

896
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:10,010
You understand?

897
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:11,390
Get lost!

898
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:14,130
I'm going!
I'll go away for ever

899
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:17,440
You'll never hear me again, Mr Adi!

900
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:19,400
Never!

901
01:12:20,050 --> 01:12:21,380
Never!

902
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,340
What are you looking for Mr Shroff?

903
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:31,180
Rahul's CD

904
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:34,050
Seriously?
- Yeah

905
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:36,760
I think I'll listen to it once

906
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:39,880
I'll call him and tell him what I feel

907
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:42,790
At least, he can move on.
Else, he'll keep dropping in

908
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:44,590
Unbearable!

909
01:12:47,090 --> 01:12:48,710
Wait. I know where it is

910
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:52,960
Is it there?

911
01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:55,750
Rahul Sharma.
- Let's hear it

912
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,750
The great Rahul's CD

913
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,410
Darn, he's good

914
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:43,500
Yeah

915
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,550
Will you call him?

916
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:54,080
You don't want to call him?

917
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:57,770
I was very rude to him yesterday

918
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:00,660
Please call him

919
01:14:00,910 --> 01:14:01,910
Sure

920
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:14,990
Hi, Rahul.
This is KD from Magik Records?

921
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:21,790
What?

922
01:14:27,470 --> 01:14:28,590
How?

923
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:32,340
I'm... I'm so sorry!

924
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:34,660
Okay

925
01:14:35,150 --> 01:14:36,650
Thank you

926
01:14:37,070 --> 01:14:38,140
Thank you

927
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:42,910
What happened?

928
01:14:43,530 --> 01:14:45,030
He's dead

929
01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:52,070
He killed himself last night

930
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:56,560
I'll go away for ever

931
01:14:57,130 --> 01:14:59,550
You'll never hear me again, Mr Adi!

932
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:01,280
Never!

933
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,320
Never!

934
01:15:12,990 --> 01:15:14,240
I'm so sorry

935
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:22,400
In all these years,
not a single day has passed by

936
01:15:24,530 --> 01:15:28,780
when I haven't wished
I had heard that CD a day before

937
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:37,610
Greetings

938
01:15:40,490 --> 01:15:42,610
They are here to meet me, father

939
01:15:46,030 --> 01:15:47,780
They were about to leave

940
01:15:57,730 --> 01:15:59,110
We'll take your leave

941
01:16:03,070 --> 01:16:04,070
Bye

942
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:42,750
Ironically,

943
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,510
though Joe was aware of Adi's problem,

944
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:49,350
he wouldn't accept it.
He was in his own world

945
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:53,320
She wears high heels,
the men go bonkers

946
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:56,450
Don't be mad, girl.
Listen to me

947
01:16:56,680 --> 01:17:00,220
I'm a king of sorts,
be my queen

948
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:03,400
If you want to be a legend,
you'll need me

949
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:15,030
The bard goes singing everywhere,

950
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:23,290
praying for everyone

951
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:28,550
Love is not to be befriended

952
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:34,650
nor to be made foes with

953
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:41,720
I am intoxicated in love

954
01:17:42,730 --> 01:17:47,140
I don't want to be in my senses

955
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:51,260
Please go on!
Please don't stop, Mann Jyot. Sing

956
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:54,650
Sir, I was just casually
...it's a folk song

957
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,580
Why didn't you sing it
at the show today?

958
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:02,830
The audience doesn't like this, sir

959
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:06,010
You know the trend.
- Are you crazy?

960
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:08,010
Who told you that?

961
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:12,130
You imitate the styles of others;
do you think the audience likes it?

962
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:17,180
They won't let you stick around, Mann Jyot

963
01:18:18,330 --> 01:18:22,830
This came from your heart.
It is the call of your heart

964
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:24,890
Sing it

965
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,460
Then you'll see

966
01:18:27,330 --> 01:18:32,090
Sir, the heart attunes itself
to the market's changing demands

967
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:34,430
Right, sir?

968
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:41,100
That's my bus, sir.
Good night

969
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:48,520
Often we notice the problems of others

970
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:51,710
but fail to understand the anguish
of our dear ones

971
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,090
Hey

972
01:18:57,050 --> 01:18:58,430
Did you speak to Jiah?

973
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:00,380
Yeah

974
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:03,550
What else?

975
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:06,630
What else?

976
01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:09,260
Nothing else, Joe

977
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,090
Besides,

978
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:14,170
what have you got to do with it?

979
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:17,980
Don't talk rubbish, KD

980
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:21,380
I'm speaking rubbish? Wow!

981
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,000
How's Adi?

982
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:31,800
Call him

983
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:33,710
Ask him yourself

984
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:36,010
No, wait

985
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:39,670
It's not your problem anyway

986
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:42,240
Just shut up, KD

987
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:43,970
You know what, Joe?

988
01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:46,340
This time, you shut up!

989
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:50,550
What's wrong with you?

990
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:54,250
I don't remember
the Joe Mascarenhas any more,

991
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,850
who'd do anything for his friends

992
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:59,510
Dare anyone mess with his friends...!

993
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:04,540
Nice. Very nice

994
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:12,420
You're drunk, KD

995
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:15,630
Maybe

996
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:17,840
But five years, Joe!

997
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:21,380
Adi has been living in pain
for five years

998
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:24,000
You know that very well, Joe

999
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:27,000
You call Adi your friend, right?

1000
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,920
That friend needed you

1001
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:33,160
He never said it
but you should've figured

1002
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:38,530
Don't do that.
- Wake up, buddy

1003
01:20:38,670 --> 01:20:40,500
That's all I'm saying to you, wake up

1004
01:20:42,290 --> 01:20:47,420
And reflect; what you were,
and what you've become now!

1005
01:21:05,890 --> 01:21:07,510
Mother used to always make it

1006
01:21:10,570 --> 01:21:12,070
On our birthdays

1007
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,010
Happy birthday

1008
01:21:22,290 --> 01:21:23,670
Not mine

1009
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:25,730
It is brother's birthday

1010
01:22:00,570 --> 01:22:02,070
Have you heard my CD, father?

1011
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:05,230
Yes, I heard your CD

1012
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:12,180
Well?

1013
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:15,570
What's this?

1014
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:18,840
Goulash? Hotchpotch?

1015
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:21,450
What is it?

1016
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:26,560
It is Raga Khamaj, father.
There's not a hint of fusion in it

1017
01:22:27,930 --> 01:22:29,550
Is this what you call music?

1018
01:22:33,610 --> 01:22:36,860
I'm ashamed to call you my son!

1019
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:42,140
You are destroying the sanctity of music

1020
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:47,180
by playing the guitar and piano along

1021
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:51,150
Novel, is it?

1022
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,950
It was a novel idea then, when the genre
of Khyal and Thumri were introduced

1023
01:22:56,530 --> 01:23:00,780
So you consider yourself
a novel exponent of music!

1024
01:23:02,530 --> 01:23:03,780
No...

1025
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,680
I am a nobody, father

1026
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:11,400
But these days even famous artistes
are doing fusion

1027
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:15,230
And you are...
- This is not a music studio

1028
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,570
This is a temple of music!

1029
01:23:19,670 --> 01:23:23,290
And here, I will hear no rubbish!

1030
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:29,310
Go away

1031
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:31,100
Yes, father

1032
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:20,250
Jiah never contacted us after that

1033
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:23,830
Neither did Adi mention her again

1034
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:34,220
Yes, Bah Sing? All good?

1035
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:38,120
It's very bad, Adi.
We are in deep trouble

1036
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,710
There's no sign of relief

1037
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:42,330
Where are the villagers then?

1038
01:24:43,030 --> 01:24:46,550
How are they?
- Starving. More than half

1039
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,820
are in the relief camp

1040
01:24:49,930 --> 01:24:52,190
Food is scarce

1041
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,630
And you're telling me now?

1042
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:02,390
I'll try to come as soon as possible.
Please don't worry

1043
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:04,010
I'm coming

1044
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:09,310
It was Bah Sing.
I'm gonna have to go

1045
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:12,460
When will you return, Adi?

1046
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:14,780
No idea

1047
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:18,360
No idea?

1048
01:25:19,470 --> 01:25:23,010
Adi, I don't want to spend the rest
of my life in a state of uncertainty

1049
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:26,190
Sakshi, please don't say
what you don't mean

1050
01:25:26,710 --> 01:25:28,170
I mean it, Adi

1051
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:33,510
I don't have a problem
in admitting that I'm a normal person

1052
01:25:33,990 --> 01:25:35,530
Even I have dreams

1053
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,420
Have I ever stopped you?

1054
01:25:38,630 --> 01:25:39,620
Never

1055
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:45,440
I agree, for all that I achieved,
you've always felt proud of me

1056
01:25:46,470 --> 01:25:48,360
But that isn't enough

1057
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:54,240
One of my dreams
is to live a normal life with you

1058
01:25:54,970 --> 01:25:56,720
Why can't you see that?

1059
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:01,420
The truth is, you have time for
everything, except for this relationship

1060
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:04,060
Sakshi, they need me

1061
01:26:12,690 --> 01:26:14,190
I guess you are right

1062
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:23,040
You know what, Adi?

1063
01:26:23,810 --> 01:26:28,740
If you want to spend all your life
in penance, then that's your choice

1064
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:31,760
But I can't be a part of it any more

1065
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:34,810
Let's just call it quits, Adi

1066
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:38,300
Sakshi, right now you are...
- This isn't impulsive

1067
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:43,120
I've deliberated much on this

1068
01:26:44,810 --> 01:26:47,790
And Rob will not be an issue between us

1069
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:52,750
I guess you can trust me on that

1070
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:15,000
How are you, Bah Sing?

1071
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,440
Let's go straight to the relief camp.
- No, Adi

1072
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:21,220
We can go to the camp only tomorrow.
- Why?

1073
01:27:21,690 --> 01:27:24,310
The bridge is being fixed,
so the road is closed

1074
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:25,940
It'll be opened tomorrow morning

1075
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:28,000
Fantastic!

1076
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:32,290
Why doesn't the government help?
- Well,

1077
01:27:32,490 --> 01:27:34,490
the Welfare Board did receive funds

1078
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:37,750
But the President and his cronies
swallowed it all

1079
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,950
Can't help it,
he's the minister's son-in-law

1080
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:45,020
Is it that guy? Mahendra?
- Yes, it's him

1081
01:27:46,370 --> 01:27:49,470
So let's go and talk to him.
- All right, let's go

1082
01:27:53,290 --> 01:27:54,290
Thank you

1083
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:57,260
Bah Sing...
- Yes?

1084
01:27:58,010 --> 01:28:00,050
Get the car. I'll be there.
- Right

1085
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:03,260
Thank you

1086
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:09,690
Hi

1087
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:11,540
Hi

1088
01:28:12,070 --> 01:28:13,950
You're here?

1089
01:28:15,250 --> 01:28:17,960
I told you, I come here often
to record folk singers

1090
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:19,380
Yeah, that's right

1091
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:29,580
My recorder conked off.
I had to send it to Delhi to get it fixed

1092
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:32,020
So I just came to collect it

1093
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,060
What brings you here?

1094
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:39,320
There's a village called Umniuh.
You might know

1095
01:28:39,510 --> 01:28:40,510
Yes

1096
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:42,790
I've been staying there
for some years now

1097
01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:45,400
Okay.
- That's where I'm going

1098
01:28:50,010 --> 01:28:52,010
God knows where Bah Sing disappeared
with the car

1099
01:28:54,130 --> 01:28:56,340
How far is Umniuh?

1100
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:58,700
It takes one and half hours to reach

1101
01:28:59,450 --> 01:29:00,420
Okay

1102
01:29:01,530 --> 01:29:02,660
Shall we?

1103
01:29:04,890 --> 01:29:06,260
Jiah, that's Bah Sing

1104
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:08,160
Hello

1105
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:11,770
See you. Bye

1106
01:29:21,850 --> 01:29:25,310
There are feelings
that cannot be expressed in words

1107
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:29,240
And then there are words
that remain unsaid

1108
01:29:31,150 --> 01:29:32,570
I wonder why!

1109
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:34,260
It's almost a month

1110
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:37,900
What is causing the delay?
Your office isn't very forthcoming

1111
01:29:40,390 --> 01:29:43,530
We have to follow the system, sir

1112
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:51,260
So you can't release the funds
given by the State and the Centre

1113
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:54,250
just because of the system

1114
01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:57,090
I see

1115
01:29:59,050 --> 01:30:02,300
I had come to you.
Do you remember?

1116
01:30:02,860 --> 01:30:06,120
But you refused
to join the Welfare Board

1117
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,450
So?
- So?

1118
01:30:11,170 --> 01:30:16,510
We have to first sort out the problems
of the board members and our people

1119
01:30:17,070 --> 01:30:18,530
I hope you understand

1120
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:21,320
With all due respect,

1121
01:30:22,270 --> 01:30:23,770
they are also your people

1122
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:26,550
Please! Don't teach me my job!

1123
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:28,340
I think I will have to!

1124
01:30:30,950 --> 01:30:34,700
It's your duty to take
the responsibility of helping them

1125
01:30:35,190 --> 01:30:38,400
And what's your responsibility?
Nothing, right?

1126
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:45,440
When I asked you to join the board,
you didn't

1127
01:30:46,270 --> 01:30:47,520
Then go ahead

1128
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:50,080
Help them yourself

1129
01:30:50,590 --> 01:30:52,010
Don't waste my time

1130
01:31:00,980 --> 01:31:02,140
Mr Shroff,

1131
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:05,990
people like you only talk

1132
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:09,070
You don't deliver

1133
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:12,500
And people like you ought to be in jail

1134
01:31:14,690 --> 01:31:17,020
We'll do what needs to be done now

1135
01:31:17,350 --> 01:31:18,480
Thank you

1136
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:38,500
Yeah?

1137
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:41,110
Hi

1138
01:31:41,650 --> 01:31:42,690
Hi

1139
01:31:43,060 --> 01:31:44,940
Sorry. I hope I'm not disturbing you

1140
01:31:45,370 --> 01:31:47,590
No. Come on in.
Take a seat

1141
01:31:47,820 --> 01:31:50,570
No, it's okay.
I was passing by, so...

1142
01:32:00,410 --> 01:32:01,530
No!

1143
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:05,730
I wasn't passing by

1144
01:32:09,570 --> 01:32:11,070
I came to see you

1145
01:32:17,590 --> 01:32:21,780
I didn't understand it
when you told me the facts

1146
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:28,220
It took me very long to realise

1147
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:32,780
that my brother was so frustrated
with his life that he...

1148
01:32:39,090 --> 01:32:40,840
It's not your cross to bear

1149
01:32:44,070 --> 01:32:45,700
It's not your fault, Adi

1150
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:50,350
Please take this burden off your chest

1151
01:32:56,990 --> 01:32:58,490
It's very kind of you

1152
01:32:59,210 --> 01:33:00,080
No

1153
01:33:00,810 --> 01:33:02,310
It's the truth

1154
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:07,300
Thank you

1155
01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:16,640
There's something else

1156
01:33:17,910 --> 01:33:21,970
Rahul had left a song incomplete

1157
01:33:23,490 --> 01:33:25,990
I sang it to you once.
Remember?

1158
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,740
“Somewhere in the realms
of the vast blue skies”

1159
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:38,020
I remember

1160
01:33:43,450 --> 01:33:45,230
Will you complete the song?

1161
01:33:47,890 --> 01:33:49,510
I'd really like that

1162
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:56,570
It'd be such an honour, Jiah!

1163
01:34:04,710 --> 01:34:07,960
Listen... are the villagers all right?

1164
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:13,500
They are not

1165
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:18,340
I heard about the state of the camps

1166
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:23,320
I'm going there tomorrow morning

1167
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,540
You can come along if you wish

1168
01:34:29,250 --> 01:34:30,350
Okay

1169
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:56,550
Adi is here!

1170
01:34:57,340 --> 01:34:58,720
Adi is here!

1171
01:35:37,610 --> 01:35:38,990
How are you, Paya?

1172
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,300
Where's your mother?

1173
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:46,030
She died

1174
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:54,330
He's right

1175
01:35:55,090 --> 01:35:57,370
She died. She was sick

1176
01:36:11,170 --> 01:36:12,380
Adi!

1177
01:36:14,740 --> 01:36:15,860
Baioman!

1178
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,020
Thank God you are here!

1179
01:36:19,570 --> 01:36:23,570
You'd say that Baiyaman
always kept your stomach full

1180
01:36:25,250 --> 01:36:27,090
I can't feed you today

1181
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:32,040
I have nothing to offer you!

1182
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:33,580
Please don't weep

1183
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:37,480
Don't be sorry

1184
01:36:39,810 --> 01:36:41,100
I've got food for you today

1185
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:43,170
Look, I've got food for you

1186
01:36:43,470 --> 01:36:44,970
Take it out

1187
01:36:45,090 --> 01:36:46,590
Bring it here, please.
- It's for all of you!

1188
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:57,060
I brought food for you

1189
01:36:58,430 --> 01:37:01,060
I went to see Mahendra today

1190
01:37:01,750 --> 01:37:03,500
He said he'll try his best

1191
01:37:04,010 --> 01:37:04,980
Here you are

1192
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:06,470
Here... have it

1193
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:14,680
Adi!

1194
01:37:15,970 --> 01:37:17,590
Why aren't the kids eating?

1195
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:34,790
Why aren't they eating?
- Adi,

1196
01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:37,760
we don't get to eat everyday here

1197
01:37:38,180 --> 01:37:42,520
We taught our children
to eat every alternate days

1198
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:45,240
We got to eat bread in the morning

1199
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:47,310
We'll eat tomorrow now

1200
01:38:11,310 --> 01:38:12,310
Darn!

1201
01:38:15,270 --> 01:38:18,800
We live in our own world,
in our own bubble

1202
01:38:19,710 --> 01:38:23,420
We have little idea what goes on outside

1203
01:38:24,650 --> 01:38:26,440
Even if we know, we ignore it

1204
01:38:28,030 --> 01:38:29,900
Or, we deliberately avoid it

1205
01:38:33,130 --> 01:38:35,230
What do you think we can do, Adi?

1206
01:38:37,390 --> 01:38:39,180
We can only do what we know

1207
01:38:42,820 --> 01:38:44,110
We're musicians

1208
01:38:45,210 --> 01:38:46,580
Let's play some music

1209
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:51,130
A big concert,
in that village in Meghalaya

1210
01:38:52,810 --> 01:38:53,930
What say?

1211
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:58,300
I don't know. It's so far

1212
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:00,000
Will it attract a crowd?

1213
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:02,330
Why not?
Shillong is the rock capital of India

1214
01:39:03,580 --> 01:39:07,250
If I may...? If other major bands
also perform with Magik,

1215
01:39:07,530 --> 01:39:09,340
then I think it'll attract people

1216
01:39:12,850 --> 01:39:16,530
All right.
I'll start calling up the bands

1217
01:39:17,300 --> 01:39:19,830
But what about the funding?

1218
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,620
We'll contribute whatever we can.
- Leave that to me

1219
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:26,860
I'll get it done

1220
01:39:35,140 --> 01:39:36,250
Thanks, Joe

1221
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:37,690
Don't thank me, Adi

1222
01:39:37,910 --> 01:39:41,160
You know, I was twelve
when my father passed away

1223
01:39:41,890 --> 01:39:45,140
All the responsibilities
fell on my mother. The poor thing

1224
01:39:46,550 --> 01:39:49,300
She had neither job experience
nor qualifications

1225
01:39:51,810 --> 01:39:54,220
Finally, she found a job

1226
01:39:54,950 --> 01:39:56,570
As a maid

1227
01:39:59,980 --> 01:40:01,600
We struggled a lot

1228
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:07,180
I know how it is to starve

1229
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:13,110
I had forgotten it

1230
01:40:14,820 --> 01:40:16,440
But you reminded me today

1231
01:40:17,450 --> 01:40:18,620
Thanks, man

1232
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:28,420
Don't worry about that funding, okay?

1233
01:40:29,630 --> 01:40:31,190
That's my responsibility

1234
01:40:32,290 --> 01:40:33,500
Joe

1235
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:37,480
For that night, I'm...

1236
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:39,560
Forget it.
Don't worry about it, Jiah

1237
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:43,240
No. I owe you and KD an apology.
I'm really sorry

1238
01:40:45,230 --> 01:40:47,190
If you really want to apologise,

1239
01:40:48,140 --> 01:40:49,770
you must promise something

1240
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:51,860
Okay

1241
01:40:53,890 --> 01:40:56,490
Guys, Jiah is coming with us.
And this time,

1242
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:58,570
she will sing with us

1243
01:41:02,710 --> 01:41:04,210
Hey, welcome back

1244
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:28,300
Rock on!
- It's the sign of the times

1245
01:41:29,090 --> 01:41:31,800
Rock on!
- Every moment beckons you

1246
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:36,170
Rock on!
- What are you waiting for?

1247
01:41:36,550 --> 01:41:40,510
Rock on!
- You won't get a second chance

1248
01:42:17,460 --> 01:42:20,550
Rock on!
- It's the sign of the times

1249
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:24,110
Rock on!
- Every moment beckons you

1250
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:27,880
Rock on!
- What are you waiting for?

1251
01:42:28,650 --> 01:42:31,490
Rock on!
- You won't get a second chance

1252
01:42:32,340 --> 01:42:35,670
Rock on!
- It's the sign of the times

1253
01:42:36,050 --> 01:42:38,840
Rock on!
- Every moment beckons you

1254
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:43,090
Rock on!
- What are you waiting for?

1255
01:42:43,340 --> 01:42:47,420
Rock on!
- You won't get a second chance

1256
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:04,330
Sir,

1257
01:43:04,630 --> 01:43:07,870
I hear, a large number of boys and girls

1258
01:43:08,150 --> 01:43:12,440
are arriving from Guwahati, Kolkata,
even from Delhi and Mumbai

1259
01:43:13,250 --> 01:43:17,790
I won't let Aditya Shroff's concert
take place

1260
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:22,020
He showed a lot of attitude the other day

1261
01:43:23,090 --> 01:43:24,810
He was acting too smart!

1262
01:43:26,010 --> 01:43:27,870
This concert is not happening!

1263
01:43:28,940 --> 01:43:30,130
Got it?

1264
01:45:17,090 --> 01:45:20,420
It was all over in just a few minutes

1265
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:24,870
The vandals

1266
01:45:25,860 --> 01:45:28,570
didn't just destroy the stage,
speakers and sound board

1267
01:45:29,590 --> 01:45:31,670
but they shattered our very dreams

1268
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:35,710
There was less than 24 hours
to the concert

1269
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:38,420
If the concert doesn't take place,

1270
01:45:38,670 --> 01:45:41,900
how will the world know
about the people's issues?

1271
01:45:47,130 --> 01:45:48,730
What do we do now, Adi?

1272
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:09,670
Hello?

1273
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:12,180
Sir, this is Alok Tiwari from Zee News

1274
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:16,020
Some goons vandalised
the concert venue in Shillong

1275
01:46:16,420 --> 01:46:18,090
Can you give us your opinion?

1276
01:46:18,670 --> 01:46:19,670
What?

1277
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:23,530
Your daughter Jiah is also participating.
Have you spoken to her?

1278
01:46:25,460 --> 01:46:27,710
As you can see on your TV screens,

1279
01:46:27,870 --> 01:46:30,040
the amount of damage is tremendous

1280
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:33,110
A few boys and girls
have even been taken to the hospital

1281
01:46:33,410 --> 01:46:36,450
Who do you think is trying
to put a spanner in your works?

1282
01:46:36,760 --> 01:46:39,880
We've informed the police.
A complaint has been lodged

1283
01:46:40,390 --> 01:46:42,010
That's all I can say for now

1284
01:46:42,290 --> 01:46:44,790
Music unites people

1285
01:46:45,030 --> 01:46:49,240
So we must stand together and show them
that such incidents won't scare us

1286
01:46:49,550 --> 01:46:53,050
After this unfortunate incident,
do you think people will still come?

1287
01:46:55,450 --> 01:46:56,780
We're hoping

1288
01:46:56,860 --> 01:46:59,110
Well, hope keeps us alive

1289
01:46:59,390 --> 01:47:02,910
We'll know only tomorrow
if the concert takes place or not

1290
01:47:03,010 --> 01:47:06,090
With cameraperson Ayush,
this is Jyoti Bhatt, ATP News

1291
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:26,760
Yes, father?

1292
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:28,580
What are you up to?

1293
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:31,320
Aren't you ashamed?

1294
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:36,250
I had to see this day! I get to hear
from the media about your whereabouts

1295
01:47:38,330 --> 01:47:40,250
You have forgotten, Jiah!

1296
01:47:40,650 --> 01:47:44,020
It is in their world
that you lost your brother!

1297
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:48,510
Father, they are my friends.
- And I am your father!

1298
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:52,590
You have disgraced me!

1299
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:55,150
What a thing to say, father!

1300
01:47:56,020 --> 01:48:00,160
Whether you respect me or not,

1301
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:05,070
you could've at least
spared a thought for Rahul

1302
01:48:05,540 --> 01:48:08,090
How can his soul rest in peace

1303
01:48:08,210 --> 01:48:12,420
when his sister
feels no remorse over his death?

1304
01:48:15,230 --> 01:48:17,280
Do you care, father?

1305
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:22,560
While he was alive,

1306
01:48:23,710 --> 01:48:25,460
did you even care?

1307
01:48:29,170 --> 01:48:32,090
He'd often weep in his room, alone

1308
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:35,980
You know why?

1309
01:48:36,820 --> 01:48:38,570
Because of you!

1310
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:44,500
'Don't waste your time on such music'

1311
01:48:46,270 --> 01:48:48,020
'You will achieve nothing'

1312
01:48:52,060 --> 01:48:54,420
That's what we used to hear, father

1313
01:49:00,030 --> 01:49:03,780
If only you had spoken to him once!

1314
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:09,850
If only you had smiled once!

1315
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:13,630
If only you had embraced him once!

1316
01:49:15,910 --> 01:49:18,660
Once, father... just once!

1317
01:49:20,940 --> 01:49:22,160
Father!

1318
01:49:24,010 --> 01:49:26,330
Brother killed himself!

1319
01:49:29,950 --> 01:49:32,660
And my life is a living death
because of you!

1320
01:49:38,260 --> 01:49:43,110
The thing that shows me a ray of hope,

1321
01:49:44,620 --> 01:49:46,660
you want to snatch that away too, do you?

1322
01:49:47,730 --> 01:49:49,110
Tell me

1323
01:49:50,430 --> 01:49:53,060
Will it make you happy, father?

1324
01:49:55,430 --> 01:49:56,470
Father?

1325
01:50:00,050 --> 01:50:01,130
Father...?

1326
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:25,020
Dad's tweet 'The show must rock on'
has already been retweeted 1750 times

1327
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:26,920
Okay

1328
01:50:27,510 --> 01:50:29,670
Vicky can organise
five Marshall amplifiers,

1329
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:31,960
speakers and guitar cables
by tomorrow morning

1330
01:50:32,090 --> 01:50:34,340
Someone will have to go to Guwahati
to pick them up

1331
01:50:35,300 --> 01:50:36,590
We can go

1332
01:50:37,530 --> 01:50:38,880
And the sound board?

1333
01:50:39,030 --> 01:50:40,980
All of them booked already
in various shows

1334
01:50:41,490 --> 01:50:44,380
Can't you try other suppliers?
- I've called up everyone

1335
01:50:44,540 --> 01:50:47,450
I think it's too short a notice
for them to help

1336
01:50:47,670 --> 01:50:49,210
What are your options, KD?

1337
01:50:52,170 --> 01:50:54,350
Just keep trying, guys.
Excuse me

1338
01:50:58,300 --> 01:50:59,340
Hi, Sakshi

1339
01:50:59,550 --> 01:51:02,130
Adi... hi.
Are you all right?

1340
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:04,110
Yes. All of us are fine

1341
01:51:04,260 --> 01:51:05,810
Oh, thank God

1342
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:08,160
I saw it in the news

1343
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:12,840
Adi, will you be able to do this concert?

1344
01:51:14,010 --> 01:51:15,180
I don't know

1345
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:17,590
Everything will be fine, Adi

1346
01:51:19,650 --> 01:51:23,010
For your purpose,
for the people you are doing this,

1347
01:51:24,050 --> 01:51:26,120
you have their prayers

1348
01:51:27,710 --> 01:51:29,010
Mine too

1349
01:51:31,410 --> 01:51:32,660
Thank you

1350
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:37,060
Sakshi, I...

1351
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:44,510
Sakshi, I'll call you back

1352
01:51:45,340 --> 01:51:47,130
Guys, we've got company

1353
01:51:47,860 --> 01:51:49,690
Looks like the scoundrels
have reached here too

1354
01:51:49,900 --> 01:51:51,070
Let them come

1355
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:53,550
We won't spare them this time

1356
01:51:59,590 --> 01:52:00,670
Adi...

1357
01:52:19,690 --> 01:52:20,820
Joe sir!

1358
01:52:20,930 --> 01:52:22,060
Mann Jyot?

1359
01:52:23,130 --> 01:52:24,510
Joe sir, where are you?

1360
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:27,340
Relax, guys. I know him

1361
01:52:28,940 --> 01:52:30,950
Mann Jyot...?
- Yes, sir

1362
01:52:34,420 --> 01:52:35,710
Turn off the lights

1363
01:52:36,340 --> 01:52:38,130
How are you, Joe sir?

1364
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:41,810
What are you doing here? We thought...
- Adi sir...?

1365
01:52:42,590 --> 01:52:44,550
Big fan, sir!

1366
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:46,440
Love you, sir.
- Hey...

1367
01:52:47,320 --> 01:52:49,380
Love you.
- He's Mann Jyot

1368
01:52:49,630 --> 01:52:51,260
From my reality show

1369
01:52:51,460 --> 01:52:54,340
What are you doing here?
- I was on my way to the concert

1370
01:52:54,550 --> 01:52:57,710
when I saw your Facebook update
that some goons vandalised the venue

1371
01:52:58,080 --> 01:52:59,580
Very bad, sir

1372
01:52:59,970 --> 01:53:01,780
Hi, bro! How are you?

1373
01:53:02,330 --> 01:53:04,540
Hi.
- You know Andy?

1374
01:53:04,930 --> 01:53:08,460
He posted the video on your page
that you needed sound equipments

1375
01:53:08,670 --> 01:53:11,630
I got it all. Sound board,
speaker, microphones, everything!

1376
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:13,800
Come out, guys! Are you frozen inside?

1377
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:18,760
Wow!

1378
01:53:19,260 --> 01:53:21,590
My star, Mann Jyot!
- I know, sir

1379
01:53:22,370 --> 01:53:23,750
You said it!

1380
01:53:25,010 --> 01:53:26,450
Well done, Andy!

1381
01:53:28,710 --> 01:53:31,590
I'm going to call Sakshi.
- Where do I put the stuff?

1382
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:34,630
Ask KD, our chief engineer

1383
01:53:34,840 --> 01:53:36,710
KD, he's Mann Jyot

1384
01:53:36,990 --> 01:53:39,380
So bro, let's go. Yo!

1385
01:53:39,510 --> 01:53:40,590
Yo!

1386
01:53:52,890 --> 01:53:55,970
Hello. This is the way
to the music concert, right?

1387
01:53:57,880 --> 01:53:59,670
There's no concert happening here

1388
01:54:00,210 --> 01:54:03,880
How come?
It's clearly mentioned here

1389
01:54:04,530 --> 01:54:06,940
Go back where you came from

1390
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:45,600
Hoi Kiw!

1391
01:55:06,910 --> 01:55:09,140
Hoi Kiw!

1392
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:12,780
Hoi Kiw!

1393
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:16,380
Hoi Kiw!

1394
01:55:17,850 --> 01:55:20,160
Hoi Kiw!

1395
01:55:21,290 --> 01:55:24,610
The town reverberates as the overpowering
sounds of the drum dominates

1396
01:55:24,930 --> 01:55:28,380
It is the public announcement,
so everyone can hear

1397
01:55:28,590 --> 01:55:31,920
Is this gathering a small or huge one?

1398
01:55:32,170 --> 01:55:35,580
Did someone die? Do people need
to put closure to some unfinished business?

1399
01:55:35,790 --> 01:55:39,020
Dead ends!
Broken bridges! Tired legs

1400
01:55:39,410 --> 01:55:42,780
And a life in the grip
of atrocities and oppression

1401
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:46,290
Light up the darkness,
rid the suffering

1402
01:55:46,590 --> 01:55:50,010
Come, let's conquer new horizons

1403
01:55:50,250 --> 01:55:54,720
The public announcement system
of the Khasis, is the most electrifying

1404
01:55:56,580 --> 01:56:00,690
We will relay the word;
we will march forward as able leaders

1405
01:56:01,270 --> 01:56:03,520
Hoi Kiw!

1406
01:56:04,870 --> 01:56:07,110
Hoi Kiw!

1407
01:56:08,250 --> 01:56:11,650
The moon has gone further up,
time is running out

1408
01:56:11,900 --> 01:56:15,160
The announcers shout on top of their voice,
waking up the sleeping babes

1409
01:56:15,470 --> 01:56:18,780
A street dog in a state of wonder,
there he stands still and be still

1410
01:56:19,070 --> 01:56:22,380
Like treading on a snake's tail, the cat
jumps and shouts because of the shock

1411
01:56:22,630 --> 01:56:27,000
The public announcement system
of the Khasis, is the most electrifying

1412
01:56:28,980 --> 01:56:33,010
We will relay the word;
we will march forward as able leaders

1413
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:01,640
Restless and ready,

1414
01:57:02,120 --> 01:57:05,250
we have set out to change the world

1415
01:57:05,590 --> 01:57:08,800
Listen to our new slogan

1416
01:57:09,190 --> 01:57:12,620
Down with tyranny

1417
01:57:27,590 --> 01:57:30,720
Together let's walk,
shake the ground in one beat

1418
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:34,530
Even the mountains
will tremble with fear at the sound

1419
01:57:34,900 --> 01:57:38,150
From this end to that,

1420
01:57:38,500 --> 01:57:41,750
let there be a trail of our blood,
sweat and tears

1421
01:57:42,090 --> 01:57:46,750
The public announcement system
of the Khasis, is the most electrifying

1422
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:52,270
We will relay the word;
we will march forward as able leaders

1423
01:57:52,920 --> 01:57:56,420
Come, let's conquer new horizons

1424
01:57:57,610 --> 01:57:59,900
Hoi Kiw!

1425
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:03,570
Hoi Kiw!

1426
01:58:04,780 --> 01:58:07,110
Hoi Kiw!

1427
01:58:09,730 --> 01:58:10,860
Enjoying?

1428
01:58:12,290 --> 01:58:13,410
Where's Jiah?

1429
01:58:14,590 --> 01:58:16,230
She isn't with you guys?
- No

1430
01:58:16,550 --> 01:58:18,050
I thought she was

1431
01:58:18,340 --> 01:58:19,460
She...

1432
01:58:20,210 --> 01:58:21,210
What?

1433
01:58:22,010 --> 01:58:23,260
Uday?

1434
01:58:23,690 --> 01:58:25,570
Pandit-ji called last night

1435
01:58:25,960 --> 01:58:26,960
So?

1436
01:58:27,330 --> 01:58:30,040
I don't know what they spoke about

1437
01:58:30,970 --> 01:58:32,470
but she was in tears

1438
01:58:33,100 --> 01:58:35,980
Why didn't you tell us?
- There was so much to do

1439
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:37,360
Relax

1440
01:58:38,290 --> 01:58:39,790
Did you speak to her?

1441
01:58:40,140 --> 01:58:43,370
No. I thought it was best
to leave her alone

1442
01:58:45,570 --> 01:58:47,570
Guys, let's find her

1443
01:58:47,690 --> 01:58:48,940
Not again!

1444
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:53,510
Fine! Let's find her

1445
01:58:53,750 --> 01:58:56,620
But be back on time, please.
We have to be up on the stage at 8

1446
01:58:56,890 --> 01:58:58,390
With or without her!

1447
01:59:01,510 --> 01:59:02,510
Listen, guys

1448
01:59:02,790 --> 01:59:05,760
If we're performing,
it'll be together, or we're not

1449
01:59:06,130 --> 01:59:07,540
I think that's fair

1450
01:59:15,340 --> 01:59:16,400
C'mon

1451
01:59:18,160 --> 01:59:20,630
For too long, you and I have been quiet

1452
01:59:20,860 --> 01:59:23,380
watching and waiting to try it

1453
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:26,040
Rise up, now rise up!
Set your sights up,

1454
01:59:26,420 --> 01:59:28,590
so tomorrow's decided

1455
01:59:28,710 --> 01:59:31,220
For too long, you and I have been quiet

1456
01:59:31,530 --> 01:59:34,000
too scared to win, don't deny it

1457
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:36,890
Rise up, now rise up!
Set your sights up,

1458
01:59:37,030 --> 01:59:39,460
so tomorrow's decided

1459
01:59:51,090 --> 01:59:52,950
I am intoxicated in love

1460
01:59:53,210 --> 01:59:56,000
Love is intoxication

1461
01:59:56,370 --> 01:59:58,390
I am intoxicated in love

1462
01:59:58,580 --> 02:00:01,460
Love is intoxication

1463
02:00:01,710 --> 02:00:04,960
I am intoxicated in love

1464
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:09,450
Love is intoxication

1465
02:00:09,730 --> 02:00:12,130
I am intoxicated in love

1466
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:15,390
I don't care for my senses

1467
02:00:15,610 --> 02:00:20,170
Whether I am lonely or I have friends,
I don't care

1468
02:00:20,360 --> 02:00:23,610
I am intoxicated in love

1469
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:25,880
Love is intoxication

1470
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:39,710
The estranged ones...

1471
02:00:44,350 --> 02:00:46,830
The estranged ones

1472
02:00:46,980 --> 02:00:51,970
wander about in search of love

1473
02:01:02,450 --> 02:01:03,570
You okay?

1474
02:01:08,340 --> 02:01:10,170
My father forbids me

1475
02:01:11,640 --> 02:01:12,640
Why?

1476
02:01:15,870 --> 02:01:19,000
For him, music is what he makes

1477
02:01:22,130 --> 02:01:25,670
Everything else is evil,
wrong... cacophony

1478
02:01:28,630 --> 02:01:30,380
He even forbid Rahul

1479
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:35,090
That could be the reason Rahul...

1480
02:01:43,130 --> 02:01:45,630
Jiah, your father is a great musician

1481
02:01:47,340 --> 02:01:49,340
I have high regards for him

1482
02:01:50,130 --> 02:01:52,010
But let me tell you something

1483
02:01:53,110 --> 02:01:55,910
A tree that grows in the shade of another,
does not bear fruit

1484
02:01:57,430 --> 02:02:00,930
Your music should not reflect
someone else's. It should be your own

1485
02:02:04,210 --> 02:02:06,210
Such was Rahul's music

1486
02:02:11,240 --> 02:02:12,990
I don't know what to do,

1487
02:02:14,820 --> 02:02:16,820
how to make my father happy!

1488
02:02:22,330 --> 02:02:23,830
Yes, he's angry now

1489
02:02:24,510 --> 02:02:26,130
Tomorrow too, perhaps

1490
02:02:27,530 --> 02:02:31,900
But when he notices you
filling the lives of many with joy,

1491
02:02:32,460 --> 02:02:34,580
he'll realise he was wrong

1492
02:02:35,900 --> 02:02:37,400
And he will realise

1493
02:02:38,700 --> 02:02:40,320
And you know what, Jiah?

1494
02:02:40,970 --> 02:02:42,840
An artiste dies,

1495
02:02:43,100 --> 02:02:45,600
but his art keeps him alive, for ever

1496
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:49,570
Rahul will live through your voice

1497
02:02:58,390 --> 02:02:59,390
Yeah

1498
02:03:00,890 --> 02:03:02,270
You're right

1499
02:03:05,770 --> 02:03:07,770
I won't let Rahul die again!

1500
02:03:27,650 --> 02:03:34,030
Somewhere in the realms
of the vast blue skies,

1501
02:03:35,190 --> 02:03:41,190
there must be a star

1502
02:03:42,560 --> 02:03:49,060
with a world of its own,

1503
02:03:49,950 --> 02:03:55,300
brimming with life

1504
02:03:56,920 --> 02:04:00,310
A world, so different from ours,

1505
02:04:00,570 --> 02:04:04,070
not a shard of suffering

1506
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:09,620
A world where life is not painful

1507
02:04:11,460 --> 02:04:15,120
Where no one cries,
no one loses his peace

1508
02:04:15,350 --> 02:04:18,810
Where no one feels lonely

1509
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:24,830
Where the heart is never broken

1510
02:04:26,370 --> 02:04:33,140
A world, bereft of misery and sorrow

1511
02:04:33,720 --> 02:04:38,580
A world, where the eyes
never shed a tear

1512
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:47,670
Where the heart
has never known malice or separation

1513
02:04:48,380 --> 02:04:55,010
A world, where wishes are granted

1514
02:05:00,640 --> 02:05:02,270
All of us must know

1515
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:05,780
For, an incredible stream of love
runs in every heart

1516
02:05:06,300 --> 02:05:10,070
Could there be such a star
somewhere in the vast blue skies?

1517
02:05:22,260 --> 02:05:27,970
In the vast ocean
that the sky is,

1518
02:05:29,630 --> 02:05:35,510
I have travelled
in a boat that the moon is

1519
02:05:37,010 --> 02:05:39,630
If you are looking

1520
02:05:40,300 --> 02:05:43,050
for a beautiful world,

1521
02:05:43,910 --> 02:05:47,040
it is right here

1522
02:05:47,660 --> 02:05:50,160
It is right here somewhere

1523
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:54,370
Yes, but it is

1524
02:05:55,020 --> 02:05:57,770
mired

1525
02:05:58,720 --> 02:06:04,100
in hatred and violence

1526
02:06:06,130 --> 02:06:09,300
Bound

1527
02:06:09,780 --> 02:06:13,150
in the shackles of greed,

1528
02:06:13,530 --> 02:06:18,650
it just failed to rise

1529
02:06:21,790 --> 02:06:28,040
Once it is purged,

1530
02:06:29,140 --> 02:06:35,270
once the shackles are broken,

1531
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:42,530
you will see that world

1532
02:06:43,490 --> 02:06:45,240
right here

1533
02:06:46,710 --> 02:06:53,330
A world, bereft of misery and sorrow

1534
02:06:53,960 --> 02:06:59,340
A world, where the eyes
never shed a tear

1535
02:07:01,260 --> 02:07:08,260
Where the heart
has never known malice or separation

1536
02:07:08,740 --> 02:07:14,740
A world, where wishes are granted

1537
02:07:19,950 --> 02:07:22,950
There'll be a gleam of smile
on every face,

1538
02:07:24,100 --> 02:07:26,910
life will be filled with love

1539
02:08:41,630 --> 02:08:43,880
Dreams will come true

1540
02:08:47,050 --> 02:08:49,430
Bad times will pass

1541
02:08:52,460 --> 02:08:56,540
We will usher in a new dawn,
a new beginning

1542
02:08:57,880 --> 02:09:02,010
It'll be new times,
a new world order

1543
02:09:02,580 --> 02:09:07,450
A world, bereft of misery and sorrow

1544
02:09:07,960 --> 02:09:12,210
A world, where the eyes
never shed a tear

1545
02:09:13,190 --> 02:09:18,310
Where the heart
has never known malice or separation

1546
02:09:18,690 --> 02:09:24,060
A world, where wishes are granted

1547
02:10:11,770 --> 02:10:15,270
I can't tell you what I feel

1548
02:10:15,550 --> 02:10:17,920
You might think I am crazy

1549
02:10:19,300 --> 02:10:22,680
I want to crawl up the TV tower

1550
02:10:23,040 --> 02:10:25,910
and scream out loud...

1551
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:30,170
Rock on!
- It's the sign of the times

1552
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:34,260
Rock on!
- Every moment beckons you

1553
02:10:34,540 --> 02:10:37,920
Rock on!
- What are you waiting for?

1554
02:10:38,360 --> 02:10:41,860
Rock on!
- You'll never get a second chance

1555
02:10:42,090 --> 02:10:45,090
Rock on!
- It's the sign of the times

1556
02:10:45,870 --> 02:10:48,620
Rock on!
- Every moment beckons you

1557
02:10:49,630 --> 02:10:52,880
Rock on!
- What are you waiting for?

1558
02:10:53,190 --> 02:10:56,770
Rock on!
- You'll never get a second chance

1559
02:10:57,880 --> 02:11:01,440
No second chance!
- No second chance

1560
02:11:01,670 --> 02:11:04,260
No second chance!
- No second chance

1561
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:07,770
No second chance

1562
02:11:34,010 --> 02:11:36,760
So that was the story
of our lives until now,

1563
02:11:37,180 --> 02:11:39,660
no less than
Sinbad the sailor's travails

1564
02:11:40,770 --> 02:11:44,770
The concert's success,
the pressure from the crowd and the media

1565
02:11:45,120 --> 02:11:47,750
forced the Welfare Board
to release the funds

1566
02:11:59,770 --> 02:12:04,410
It took some time but the village
gradually limped back to normal

1567
02:12:12,750 --> 02:12:15,250
Though the relationship
between Adi and Sakshi has changed,

1568
02:12:15,380 --> 02:12:18,260
they're still friends, like before

1569
02:12:18,590 --> 02:12:19,840
And as promised,

1570
02:12:19,960 --> 02:12:23,260
Adi goes camping with Rob
during his summer holidays

1571
02:12:23,810 --> 02:12:27,060
I think, there'll soon be an addition
to Magik's musicians

1572
02:12:36,060 --> 02:12:37,200
That's right

1573
02:12:37,410 --> 02:12:40,790
Another bright side of the concert
...Magik was back!

1574
02:12:41,580 --> 02:12:42,580
Kind of

1575
02:12:42,740 --> 02:12:47,240
We friends perform
at least once a month in Joe's club

1576
02:12:47,700 --> 02:12:49,570
Adi, Joe, I...

1577
02:12:49,750 --> 02:12:52,100
and our new member. Uday

1578
02:12:55,230 --> 02:12:58,230
You must be wondering about Jiah,
I know

1579
02:12:58,380 --> 02:12:59,370
Listen up

1580
02:12:59,470 --> 02:13:03,310
Jiah and Adi's musical journey
that began with an incomplete song

1581
02:13:03,580 --> 02:13:05,710
has come a long way now

1582
02:13:06,410 --> 02:13:09,660
Adi writes,
while both of them compose

1583
02:13:09,930 --> 02:13:12,680
Sometimes they sing together,
sometimes Jiah alone

1584
02:13:13,040 --> 02:13:16,910
Oh, by the way,
Jiah has become a singing sensation
