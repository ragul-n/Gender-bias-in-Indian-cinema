1
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:45,061
I'm forgetting something...

2
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:08,853
<i>Krishna! Breakfast is ready!</i>
<i>Hurry up and come down.</i>

3
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,422
Dude! What's going on?

4
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:15,151
Jesus Eric! You scared the shit out of me.
I thought you were my mom.

5
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,591
Did you get everything into my car?

6
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:25,871
Yeah! I never realized
I had so much shit.

7
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:28,597
Tell me about it. Come on.
Give me a hand with this stuff.

8
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:32,608
I want to get out of here before
my mom starts all her religious crap.

9
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,847
Hey, I finally got in touch with
somebody from the housing office.

10
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,450
And found out why they wouldn't
let us room together?

11
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,847
What lame-ass excuse did
they give you?

12
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,022
Check this out!

13
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:47,023
This year they decided to try some new
policy of housing people by major.

14
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,492
It's like kindergarten,
remember that.

15
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,355
When they grouped us by animals.

16
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:56,968
"This table is for the Giraffes &
that one's for the Kangaroos"

17
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,139
Have you ever noticed why dumb
kids sat at the Otter table.

18
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:04,033
Every dumb ass, I've ever met,
always sat at the Otter table.

19
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,702
I think they were trying to be nice
by not calling slow kids to their face.

20
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:14,276
Hey... I was at the Otter table?
- Really.

21
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:25,426
Aww! Come on Mom! You said you weren't
going to make a big deal about this!

22
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:30,297
Krishna beta, you know your mother.
Leaving the house is leaving the house.

23
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:35,236
No matter where you go.
Just let her do her puja.

24
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,750
Mom!

25
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:52,013
No that's okay Kris. I need
all the help I can get.

26
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:47,844
Dad!

27
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,212
Mr. Reddy! Thanks for all your help
with calculus last year.

28
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,948
I really appreciated it.

29
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,186
- Mention not, Eric.

30
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:04,396
Take care at school and
keep an eye on Krishna.

31
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:07,362
Make sure he keeps up with his studies.

32
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:10,661
Wow!

33
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,332
Eric, let's go...

34
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:21,345
There he is. - Hello, Krishna.

35
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,356
Good luck, Krishna!
Don't forget to call us.

36
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:34,858
So Krishna beta. This is the big day for you.

37
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,494
Best of luck to you son.

38
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,221
Thanks a lot Uncle.
- That's okay. Carry on.

39
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:45,697
Mr. Reddy! So good to see you again!
- Eric! Good to see you too.

40
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,702
Best of luck to you college too.

41
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:02,316
Good luck in college, brother.
- Thanks.

42
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,203
Don't worry mom. I'm just a
couple of hours away.

43
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:35,244
Good luck Krishan bete. Don't forget to call us
when you reach the college.

44
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,219
You know your mother will not eat
until she hears from you

45
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,255
Thanks pop. Yeah! I won't forget.

46
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:51,936
Come on dude, let's go...
- Finally!! I thought I'd never get out of there.

47
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:57,770
<i>My shoes are Japanese,</i>
<i>This Pantloon is British.</i>

48
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,774
Oh man! C'mon Dad!?

49
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,675
<i>Sir my Cap is Russian,</i>
<i>But still this heart is Indian.</i>

50
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:07,352
Dude, was that the new one from
Third Eye Blind? -Ha... Ha... Hey very funny.

51
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:24,860
Bye Krishna... - Bye... Bye son
- Call us.

52
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,113
Freedom.

53
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,562
Freedom... Freedom...

54
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,312
Hey! I'm hungry. Your mom give you
any of her spicy balls?

55
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:48,486
Don't ever say 'spicy balls',
& 'your mom' in the same sentence to me.

56
00:09:58,464 --> 00:09:59,954
Did your mom got any? I'm hungry!

57
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,225
No! That's the last thing I need.

58
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:06,269
I'm finally out of the house, man &
I'm never going back.

59
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,754
Hey Kris. I've been thinking about
that ceremony your mom performed. Look man,

60
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,591
Don't ask me to explain anything about it.

61
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,095
I just wait there till she finishes it

62
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,029
She was blessing us right?

63
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,726
I mean, we're not married
or anything, are we?

64
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:39,495
What?

65
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:43,368
I'm just asking. I saw this documentary
on the Discovery Channel.

66
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:46,101
And they said the dot was
the symbol of marriage.

67
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,143
Well, whatever it means,
if I were you,

68
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:52,408
I'd wipe that shit off before you start
attracting the Hare Krishnas.

69
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:25,812
Hey Kris, I got a feeling we gonna
have a lot of fun this year.

70
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,612
I don't know what, but I get
the same feeling man.

71
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:43,494
Well, Thanks for the ride man.
- No problem. What's a husband for?

72
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:14,122
Are you okay yaar (friend)?
- Ouch. Yeah I'm fine.

73
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:24,134
Hi, my name is Jagjit Singh.
- Whoa! Kris. Kris Reddy.

74
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,868
Oh Chris! So, where are you staying?

75
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,309
I mean, obviously your in Raritan,
but which room?

76
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,046
I'm in 345

77
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:35,485
What do you say yaar! So am I!
I guess we'll be room partners.

78
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:42,287
Let me help you with your stuff roomie.
- No that's alright. You don't...

79
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,520
Arey! Don't worry yaar! I'm already settled.

80
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,288
My parents helped me move
in this morning.

81
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,330
Wait a minute, let me get my stuff.

82
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:55,396
Come on. So Chris. You must be a
last minute change?

83
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,465
I didn't see your name on the door.

84
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,211
By the way, I took the bed on
the left. I hope you don't mind.

85
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,386
I like to paint and the sun shines on
the left side of the room.

86
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,020
It gives me inspiration.

87
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,020
What's that smell?

88
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,833
Krishnagopal Reddy! That is you?!

89
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,929
But what is this Chris!

90
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:34,170
Oh! I get it. Kris with a K! Top yaar!
Makes it easy for the goras!

91
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,907
You should see how they
pronounce my name...

92
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,058
Marry her chutiya (ass-hole)!

93
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,061
You're not going to get
anyone better.

94
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:57,958
Hey Salim! Look!
This is Krishnagopal Reddy.

95
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,660
He's going to be our room partner.

96
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,640
Krishna. This is Salim Ali Khan.

97
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,537
Hello Krishna. How are you?

98
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,608
Hey who would you make a better wife?

99
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,804
Rekha or Shabana Azmi? Rekha right??

100
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,976
Listen, the name is Kris.

101
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,743
What the hell was that!

102
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:18,947
Yo, Yo, Yo Jagjit. - What's happening man?
Bhai-sahib.

103
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:23,584
You! You got a toolbox or some shit I can borrow?
I gotta hang up my surround sound.

104
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:29,927
Ajay. Check it out! This is Krishnagopal.
He's going to be room partner.

105
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:33,571
Wat up bro? Ajay Pandya's the name.
Jessee Krushna man.

106
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,535
Listen! I gotta go get some
more speaker wire.

107
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:39,575
So where's my sneakers at?

108
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:42,076
Don't ask. I don't know either.

109
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:47,014
Alright! Who's hungry? My mom made some
fantastic chicken tikka masala!

110
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:51,245
Get that shit out of my face man!

111
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,070
I don't believe this.

112
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:34,932
(knock) Come In. - Ajay? Hey Salim. Do you
remember that episode of Gilligan's Island when,

113
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,529
They were all kidnapped and their
personalities were switched?

114
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:37,827
I know what you mean.

115
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,402
Somewhere in Jersey, there's a black guy,
driving around in a

116
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,506
Honda Accord and praying
to Lord Ganesh.

117
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,970
Hey, hand me the cello tape yaar.

118
00:15:57,222 --> 00:16:00,487
<i>Oh! My piece of the moon.</i>

119
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,786
Have you seen a more beautiful
vision, Jagjit?

120
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:11,326
Rekha! Did you see, 'Umrao Jaan'.
A classic film yaar.

121
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,528
A classic film and a classic woman.

122
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:18,472
To find a wife like that is all
I ask of Allah. So beautiful. So pure.

123
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:24,848
Yeah... Hey! Didn't she play a
prostitute in that movie?

124
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:29,783
Ah bay! Shut your mouth sala!
Don't talk about Rekha like that. -Sorry.

125
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,733
Yo Krishna! Wanna check out
the bookstore with us man?

126
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:45,369
What?

127
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,038
We're going to get our textbooks.
Do you want to come?

128
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:51,136
No thanks. -Come on Krishna!!

129
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:57,008
Look, my name is Kris! K-R-l-S!

130
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,013
Is that so difficult to remember?

131
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,948
Just leave me alone, okay?

132
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,815
I don't feel like getting
my books right now.

133
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,986
Okay!? Come on guys, let's go.

134
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,169
So what's up with Krishnagopal yaar!?

135
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,804
My name is Kris, K-R-l-S.

136
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,769
If he has a problem with the color
of his own people,

137
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,533
It isn't my bloody problem.

138
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:28,179
May be the coconut bhaisaab
is color blind,

139
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,541
And God stuck your prophet ass here to
enlighten him.

140
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:34,410
Did you see his face when you
whipped out that stank chicken!

141
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,019
Niggah went crazy, yo!

142
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,121
My mother cooked that chicken,
ben-chod.

143
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:41,588
Who knows? Maybe he's never
lived away from home.

144
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:46,197
You should have seen my house
this morning. My mom just kept crying.

145
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,196
She wanted me to go to community
college so I could stay at home.

146
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:50,791
Yeah? Well I'm anxious too, but

147
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,493
You don't see me actin'
like a biatch!

148
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,695
You don't need to act,
you're the genuine article, okay?

149
00:17:54,907 --> 00:18:00,140
Yo! I just got two words for
you bro... TERI GAND.

150
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:07,579
Eric... phone -Thanks man.

151
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,482
Yello?

152
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:11,451
GET ME OUT!!

153
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:12,817
Kris? Dude! What's going on? So?

154
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,515
How's your new pad?
You get cool roommates?

155
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,887
Not! You're not going to believe this.

156
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:19,990
They're all Indian!
Every single one of them.

157
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,564
This place smells worse than my house.

158
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,292
You've only been there a couple of hours.
How bad could it be?

159
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:25,834
How bad could it be?

160
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:29,405
Well let's see. Bachelor number one,
who hasn't shut up since, I got here.

161
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,076
He thinks, we are some long lost
brothers from the old country.

162
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,404
Bachelor number two has already
managed to permanently stink up.

163
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,011
The place for good with his mom's cooking.

164
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:41,016
And bachelor number three thinks, he's
some reincarnation of MC Hammer.

165
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,482
Okay that sounds pretty bad.

166
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:45,020
Hey Eric, do me a favor?

167
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:46,655
Switch with me.

168
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:50,295
What are you nuts? You should see the girl
across the hall from me right now.

169
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,119
But, they'll be tons of spicy balls?

170
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,094
I got to go. I'll talk to
you later man.

171
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:04,439
Hey Salim? What would you give as
a wedding present to someone?

172
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,940
Wedding present! For who?

173
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,442
Well, my brother is getting married

174
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,273
Next month and I can't think
of anything to get him.

175
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:13,551
Yo! How about this?
Knowledge is Power! Man.

176
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:16,619
Ajay! I'm not giving my brother
a copy of the 'Kama Sutra'.

177
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,847
Put that back before somebody sees us.

178
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:24,528
Yo! Yo! Are we the Shaboinking
people or what?

179
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,235
Hey Salim did you see the
movie 'Kama Sutra'?

180
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,931
Rekha was in that one too, wasn't she?

181
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:39,542
Yeah. She was so amazing in that.

182
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,612
I only hope my wife looks as good
when she gets to that age.

183
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,881
Didn't she play a prostitute
in that one too?

184
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:47,642
Listen, chutiya! This is the last time
I'm going to tell you...

185
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:51,254
Oh no wait! She played
a teacher. - Yeah.

186
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,849
She taught the others how
to be prostitutes. - Sala!

187
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,655
You should tell your brother
to file using a fiance visa.

188
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,958
Your bhabi can come over much faster
than with citizenship visas.

189
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,295
I don't think Queen's residents need
a visa to come to Jersey.

190
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:10,173
She's from here? Oh!

191
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,310
Then may be you should get
an Indian cook book,

192
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,312
Unless your brother likes
eating out.

193
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,072
You should see one of my cousins
she lives here.

194
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,681
She tried to make some rice.
She burnt the whole thing.

195
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,681
I mean, come on yaar, how hard
is it to boil rice.

196
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,016
At least with a girl from India,
you know she can cook.

197
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,853
So, that's what you're going to do?
Go back to India to get married?

198
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,086
Of course! I've got it
all figured out.

199
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:35,093
Once I get Masters and settle into a job,
my parents'll start the ball rolling.

200
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,693
They know a lot of people in India.

201
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,870
Who wouldn't want to marry
a Green card holder.

202
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,699
You wouldn't even consider an
Indian girl from here?

203
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,535
No way. I don't need all that headache
when I come home from work.

204
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,540
Salim! Let's go out for dinner again.
I'm too tired to cook. I work too!

205
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,216
Come on yaar! Not all Indian girls
here are like that.

206
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:52,883
You've seen them!

207
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,315
They're always hanging out at
the parties with those goras.

208
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,555
I mean, when would they learn
how to cook a decent daal?

209
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,555
Whatever! Come on. The line
is getting longer.

210
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,728
I would like to pay for these by
credit card and these by cash please?

211
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,328
Yo! What up with the partition?
Are those Pakistani brushes?

212
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,668
The credit card bill goes home
to my dad.

213
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:16,908
Yeah. So?

214
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,737
Let's just say, my dad doesn't take too
kindly to "foolish" things like art.

215
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:21,571
Come on!

216
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,941
Nahi yaar, I'm serious.

217
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,145
If he found out, I bought this stuff,
He'd put my balls in a sling.

218
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,347
Oh my brother! You are oppressed.

219
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,780
Excuse me, is this room 1123?

220
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,446
Is this Intro to Engineering?

221
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,645
Good morning students.

222
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,471
My name is Professor Rosenstein.
Welcome to Engineering...

223
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:38,756
Engineering is a difficult field and
requires hard work and dedication.

224
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,885
Please take a moment and look at the
person to your right and to your left.

225
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,332
One of you three WILL fail!

226
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,105
Two T.A. S will assist
me this semester.

227
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,005
They will answer any questions
you may've about my lectures

228
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,772
And they will grade the assignments.

229
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,442
The first T.A. Is Mr. Pan Bi Yong.

230
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,850
The other T.A. Is Mr. Gautam Rao...

231
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:18,689
Oh man, a desi T.A., he's going
to be tough as shit.

232
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,455
Hmm... It seems Mr. Rao
hasn't arrived yet.

233
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,265
He's probably running
on Indian Standard Time.

234
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,532
Watch him stroll in at
the end of class.

235
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:33,209
Based on 3 items, your Mid-term exam,
final exam & weekly test & assignments.

236
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,806
Your assignments will be due
at the end of every week.

237
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:45,823
I want them typed and delivered to my
office no later than 4pm on Fridays.

238
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,293
Professor? Is it alright if we e-mail them
to you, professor?

239
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:56,291
No. E-mail is for Computer
Science majors.

240
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,395
This is an Engineering curriculum.
- You see that...

241
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,731
You see how disrespectful she's to the Prof.?
That's what I was talking about.

242
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,974
Can you imagine coming home from a hard
day at work to that kind of nagging?

243
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:16,576
If you fail in one area,
you don't move forward.

244
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,419
Okay class, that's all for today.

245
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,420
Be sure to read the first
3 chapters for next week.

246
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,096
There may be a quiz.

247
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,776
Well Mr. Rao. Nice of you
to join us.

248
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,150
Next time perhaps you could
actually attend the class.

249
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:54,792
Class is over?

250
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,463
Hey, let's get some lunch.
I'm starving.

251
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:07,638
I hear that, yo!

252
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,378
I hear that, yo! - Hey, let's go & get some lunch, ya?

253
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:19,574
Excuse me!

254
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,387
But of course! Madam probably has
a toga party to go to.

255
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,592
Hey Eric! What's up?

256
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:42,499
Did you see that? He just blew us off.
I'm told he doesn't like us, sala.

257
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,335
He probably just didn't see us.
Give the guy a break.

258
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,842
He had no problem zoning in on the
goris. That's for sure.

259
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:48,842
Hello everyone.

260
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,969
God damn! That's your lunch niggah!!

261
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:16,466
No wonder people in India are starving
you got all the food.

262
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:20,140
So, how did everyone like this
morning's lecture?

263
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:24,148
If you have any questions,
you can visit me in my office.

264
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:25,247
I am always there.

265
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,712
Yo man, Is the professor really going
to quiz us next week

266
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:28,851
Or is he just shitting us?

267
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,716
Oh no. I would recommend you
read those chapters.

268
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:36,585
Professor Rosenstein is a
very serious teacher.

269
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,334
So what're you gonna do about
your roommates man?

270
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,072
You mean 'room partners'!
What can I do?

271
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,335
What's wrong with your roommates?

272
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,409
He got stuck with a bunch
of crazy Indians.

273
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,412
Really! My brother lived
with some Indians.

274
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,482
Out in New Mexico a couple of
years ago.

275
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:05,154
And he told me they
love to get drunk,

276
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:09,287
and naked and dance around
in the moonlight.

277
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,503
You can take it...
- No that's alright. Go ahead.

278
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:22,500
Thank you.

279
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,506
Have to have a lot of ketchup
with my home fries.

280
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:36,951
You look familiar.
Have I seen you somewhere?

281
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,556
Probably in Engineering class
this morning.

282
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,724
Oh! That's right!

283
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,463
Oh, I can't believe he's
such a dinosaur!

284
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:49,122
I mean, Hello! We can't email
our homework assignments?

285
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:56,398
Come on!! I bet he still
uses a slide rule.

286
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,807
Actually, I agreed with him.

287
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:12,654
Oh... by the way,
my name is Farah... Saeed.

288
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,987
Salim Ali Khan.

289
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:22,827
Salim! That's such a beautiful name.
Where is your family from?

290
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,836
Mirzapur... it's a small town near...

291
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:32,840
Varanasi! I know. I grew up near Varanasi.
My grandmother is from Mirzapur.

292
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,568
No way, -Yeah way.

293
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:37,506
I gotta to go. Bye.

294
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,708
What about your ketchup?
- I changed my mind. Bye.

295
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,193
Hey, so who's up for the
party tomorrow tonight?

296
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,019
What party??

297
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,855
The Freshman Orientation Party!

298
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:56,591
It's gonna be the shit! Dope music!
Squizahs to the left and rizight.

299
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,528
Yeah sure. Why not? - Dope!

300
00:28:58,737 --> 00:28:59,863
I don't know if that's such
a good idea.

301
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,699
You heard what Gautamsahib said,
Professor Rosenstein is very tough.

302
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:03,703
We should study for that quiz.

303
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:07,207
We should study for that Quiz...
What you talkin' bout Salim?

304
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,040
Don't sweat the books, yo!
We got all year for that.

305
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:13,547
Okay, okay, I'll go but I'm not going
to stay too late.
- (slurping)

306
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,392
Hey so you girls going to the
Freshman Orientation Party?

307
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,760
Like of course.

308
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,959
Hey dude, why don't you invite
your roommates?

309
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,071
What are you on crack?
Why have to do that?

310
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:37,901
To break the ice. Maybe they'll
loosen up & you'll get to like them?

311
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,139
No! I don't think so. Thanks.

312
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,321
Look at this place!

313
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,858
Can you believe there are
this many freshmen?

314
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,099
It's going to be tough yaar.

315
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,665
We're going to study much
harder to beat the curve.

316
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,208
You are a goddam party, bitch!

317
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,110
Forget the curve, Let's meet some
desi booty yo!

318
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:30,351
Speaking of desi booty,
check her out?

319
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,131
Yo man. She smiled at you!
Go talk to her.

320
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,301
No way yaar! She's that crazy girl
from our class.

321
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:48,036
Salim! It doesn't get much easier
than this in life. Come on.

322
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,913
Yeah! I'm sure she calls every guy
she sees. Come on.

323
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,809
She's coming...

324
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:57,583
Hi Salim.

325
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:02,993
Hi Farah.

326
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:07,995
So, how come you took off this morning?
Was it something I said?

327
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,859
No, I just had to catch up with
my friends. They were leaving. Oh!

328
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:22,740
Well??

329
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:24,947
Well what?

330
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,415
Aren't you going to
ask me to dance?

331
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,948
Oh no! I'm not much a dancer.

332
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,620
Oh! Come on...

333
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,694
So what do you think?

334
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,433
Wowee boss! I can't believe
we are here.

335
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,769
Wait till, I tell the guys
in home room.

336
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,503
Top shelf. - First class.

337
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,572
Hey Boss? May be get something to drink.

338
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:57,346
You know something like coffee,
- Tea..., -Chai... Limca... lemonade.

339
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:04,719
- Or Johnny Walker? BLUE LABEL!!

340
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,726
I can't wait to graduate next year.

341
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:10,986
Then we can all come together yaar.

342
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:15,288
Hey let's go & check out the DJ table.
Maybe we can steal some of his compact disc.

343
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,499
- Cool Runnings man! Good Movie! Let's go.

344
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:26,001
Relax chutiya! Show some class chodu!

345
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,576
This is not some high school party!

346
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,478
You should be happy I let
you guys come with me.

347
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,482
Oh we are, Boss!
We are so happy.

348
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,247
What did I tell you about
touching my jacket?

349
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,419
Didn't I say not to touch it?

350
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,149
Do you want to go back to Raymonds
in Bombay to get it pressed?

351
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:47,253
Sorry Rakeshbhai. Very bad...

352
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:58,841
Dude! See that girl over there by the punch bow?
That's the girl from my Engineering class. - Yeah!

353
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,708
I hate to do this to you buddy, but.

354
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,705
I think this is going to be
a solo mission.

355
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,450
I've got a line I've
been dying to try.

356
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,948
What do you mean?
I thought I was your wing man.

357
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,851
You are. Consider this a
reconnaissance mission.

358
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,456
Alright, but don't forget I told
those two girls to show up.

359
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,061
Yeah, I won't, I'll be back.

360
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,196
Famous last words.

361
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,403
Hi, buy me a pizza?

362
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,067
Excuse me?

363
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:35,642
Buy me a pizza?

364
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,816
Buy you a pizza?

365
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:43,142
Yeah. I'm really hungry and I'm totally
tapped out of cash.

366
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,150
And there's a great pizza place
around the corner.

367
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:47,552
So I was wondering,
if you'd buy me a pizza?

368
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,893
No. Are you crazy?
I'm not going to buy you a pizza.

369
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,891
And I don't know if you know
how this works but.

370
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:56,328
You're supposed to be
buying me a Pizza?

371
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:00,904
Okay.
- Okay, what?

372
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,007
I'll buy you a pizza all you
had to do was ask.

373
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,170
Wait a minute. Just that you were
tapped out of cash.

374
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:07,901
Well I am.

375
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,007
But it's not everyday a beautiful girl
like yourself

376
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,580
Asks a guy like me out for a pizza.

377
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,178
Trust me, I will find a way
to scrape together the money.

378
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,246
Cute. Very cute.

379
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,692
I don't think I've ever heard a
pickup line that devious before.

380
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,691
I may have to try it myself sometime.

381
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,593
So, you're in Professor Rosenstein's
class, right - Yeah!

382
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,368
Intro to Engineering?

383
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,040
I saw you this morning.

384
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:42,607
You were sitting in the third row
fourth seat from the left, my left.

385
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:43,710
I was sitting in the back.

386
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,714
My name is Kris... Kris Reddy.

387
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:49,712
I'm Nina.

388
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,072
Uh... I think I've to go.
Jagjit is calling me.

389
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,406
JAGJIT! I'M COMING!!

390
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,303
I do have ears underneath man.

391
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,574
So how do you like it here so far?

392
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,406
It's really different from
high school, huh?

393
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,582
I'll say! It's a little scary but...

394
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,308
At least I don't have to worry about
my parents when I get home late.

395
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:23,754
How about you? You like it?

396
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,751
Oh definitely! Although I'm not to
thrilled with my room assignment.

397
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,323
Oh! What?

398
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:30,856
Roommates.

399
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,987
Got stuck with bunch of weirdos, huh?

400
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,592
What, Neo-Nazis? Pot-heads?

401
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:42,000
No, nothing like that. Its just... They're all Indian.

402
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:44,873
You don't like Indians?

403
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,271
No, I mean I Yes I do
my parents are Indian.

404
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:52,078
But they always used to drag me to these
cultural events when I was kid, you know?

405
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,874
And man are they boring.

406
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:58,112
And I find thought when I came to college
I'd be out of that stuff through with it... You know?

407
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,956
Sounds like you got a raw deal.

408
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,626
Yeah right! Trust me.
You can't imagine how it is.

409
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,226
No, I don't suppose I can.

410
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,690
What's up Kris? - Krishna
- How it's going man?

411
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,565
I was doing fine till now.

412
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,167
<i>Oh! Let's go guys! Can't you see,</i>

413
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,972
<i>He's trying to pick up this chick.</i>

414
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,574
<i>But this girl can't be picked up</i>
<i>that easily guys!</i>

415
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,918
What's the matter? You look like
just seen a ghost.

416
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,719
I didn't realize you were Indian.

417
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,159
Why? Is that a problem?

418
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,059
No. Not at all.

419
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:46,393
All that stuff I said,
must have sounded kind of...

420
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,166
I mean you just don't look
or sound like an Indian.

421
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,840
I'm not sure if that's
a compliment or an insult.

422
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,612
Hey Nina. Who's your new friend?

423
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,213
Oh Rakesh, Hi. This is Krishna.
Krishna Reddy.

424
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,950
Krishna, this is Rakesh Patel.
We went to the same High School.

425
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,020
Yeah, we go back a long way.

426
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,690
Our parents have known each other
since before we were born.

427
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,416
Yeah, we practically grew up like
brother and sister.

428
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:16,026
Hey Boss! Check it out. HEMANT and
CHANDU INCORPORATED.

429
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,529
Bloody fool! Why don't you watch
where you're going?

430
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,204
Sorry boss...

431
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,872
Rakesh Relax.
It was just an accident.?

432
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,042
That ben chod ruined my
Raymond's jacket.

433
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:29,202
Do you know how much it cost?
- A lot? Lot only?

434
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,774
Wait. I'll go get a napkin,
don't worry.

435
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,579
KYA MAAL HAI, HUH?

436
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:39,222
What?

437
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,728
He said, "Nice titties".

438
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,466
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were Indian.

439
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,266
You know, Rakesh, I don't know
why you're all upset about?

440
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:03,141
I think I saw this jacket at K-mart
the other day for ten bucks.

441
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,248
Why don't you buy yourself another one?
K-Mart! It's cheap. Bad.

442
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:16,158
What are you laughing at!
- What're you...

443
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,022
Hemant? Wait up!

444
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,464
Oh man! Gross!

445
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:18,111
Salim, bhaiya! You know I respect your
religion and all,

446
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,991
But one of these days, someone's
gonna get hurt.

447
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,160
What?

448
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,219
Never mind.

449
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,567
Well!! Hey Salim, listen to this.

450
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,178
"The Indian Club is holding its
first meeting of the year.

451
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:46,547
All are invited to attend at the
main hall at 7.30 pm. No IST"

452
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,350
"The Indian Club is dedicated to
promoting Indian culture and organizes,

453
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,784
Various events throughout
the year, including...

454
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:58,351
A Diwali Show, Bhangra Night,
and Navratri Garba"

455
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,865
Garbas!! Yo, I'm down wit dat!
Where my dandias(sticks) at.

456
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,534
Put on some clothes for God's sake.
I am trying to praying over here?

457
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,464
Oh, sorry
Yo, I thought I felt a draft.

458
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,875
So, what up with the Indian club?
Are we going?

459
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:12,542
Sure!

460
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:18,545
Hey Kris! You want to go to
Indian Club Meeting, tonight at 7:30 pm.

461
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:20,040
Yeah Right.

462
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,382
Yeah but I thought he'd
want to see Nina.

463
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,214
She'll probably be there.

464
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:52,181
So when did you realize you were
Van Gogh's reincarnation.

465
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,180
I've been painting since I was a kid.

466
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,320
I always got in trouble for
drawing in class.

467
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,256
So you figured Differential Equations,
Thermodynamics...

468
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,588
And Quantum Physics would free
the artist within?

469
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,523
Why not major in Fine Art or Painting?

470
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:13,535
Yeah. You try to explain that to my dad.

471
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,270
He's already talking to
some of his friends,

472
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,443
Trying to get me a job in their
construction companies.

473
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,878
Why don't you just tell him that
inside you are not an Engineer.

474
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:29,610
If I tell him that, he would take out
his sword and cut my balls off.

475
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:37,018
No way man. Nobody in my family has
the courage to stand up to him.

476
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,460
He doesn't listen to anybody.

477
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:48,972
Hey not bad.

478
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,369
Only 30 minutes late this time.
You're getting better, Sahib.

479
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:16,491
Hello class!

480
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,834
Let me take a quick
attendance check.

481
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,397
And then we will start with
today's lesson.

482
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,172
Jesus Alvarez?

483
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,842
Jesus! It's pronounced 'Hey-zoos'.

484
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,681
But it is spelled with a 'J' in my book.

485
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,076
The J is silent man.

486
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:37,680
Oh Okay. Very good. Salim Ali Khan
- Present.

487
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,016
Mary Fuller... Here.

488
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,089
Jagjit Singh.

489
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:44,952
Honathan Scott.

490
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:47,761
It's Jonathan. J

491
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,034
What happened to the silent 'J'?

492
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,195
It's not silent.

493
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:59,364
I think there are more exceptions than
there're rules in English grammar...

494
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,108
Oh Shit!

495
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,046
Does anyone have a rubber?

496
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,717
Jesus, Do you have a rubber??

497
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,120
Miss, You must have a little rubber
in your purse, na?

498
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:21,592
I need a little rubber.
Who has a rubber?

499
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:26,463
Yo bhaisaab, It's called an eraser dawg.

500
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,739
Krishnagopal Reddy.

501
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,609
Here. The name is Kris.

502
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:43,151
Excellent. Well let us begin by reviewing
the Professor's lecture notes.

503
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,427
I don't believe it.
A QUIZ! In our first week.

504
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,428

Hey check it out guys. I've been
talking to some of my homie's right.

00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:02,768
And you know what that means...

508
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:03,439
What?

509
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:04,767
SQUIZAHS!!!!!!!!

511
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,616
Oh hi guys. Fine. So where's Kris?

512
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,975
Oh, he's probably with his gora friends.

513
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,123
We were just talking about the
Indian club meeting. Are you going?

514
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:20,949
Yeah. How about you guys?

515
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:21,783
Definitely.

516
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:23,626
Is Kris going?

517
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:27,695
Yeah. He's gonna go to an
Indian club meeting... Come on.

518
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,523
Okay -See you.

519
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:41,808
Hey Beta Beta Beta is having a kegger tonight. You

520
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:42,979

521
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:50,181
So?

522
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:53,912
Um... no. I'll have to pass.

523
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:55,921
Aw, come on man! Don't you want to
see what it's like?

524
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:58,094
Remember 'Animal House'?
Toga! Toga! Toga!

525
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:03,062
Yeah I know but I really got to
get some homework done tonight.

526
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:08,031
Seriously The rest of the week is
shot for me. - You suck!

527
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,947
Welcome to the
first meeting of the Indian club.

528
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:22,243
My name is Priya and
I am the President.

529
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:28,353
The association's goals are to promote
Indian culture in the University.

530
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,720
And we achieve these goals
through various events.

531
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:33,522
We have our Diwali and Holi Shows,

532
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,359
Where students get to show off
their acting talents,

533
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,432
And then we have our Bhangra Night,

534
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:42,196
And our biggest event, the Navratri Garba.
- Look, who decided to show up.

535
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:46,001
I knew it, I had this feeling inside,
he wanted to come.

536
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:49,111
Not even the Prophet Mohammed
could've forseen this one.

537
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:53,208
Krishna! Kris! Yaar! Bhaiya!

538
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:57,053
We only have three weeks to
get this organized

539
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,381
So I'd like to start getting volunteers
for the committees right now.

540
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,457
So our most important area
is in decoration.

541
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:06,459
We need volunteers to help with
the decoration of the hall!

542
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,233
Oh! You! Thank you,
thank you very much.

543
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:14,461
We need people to help
with promotions.

544
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:19,633
How about you in the back,
second to last row?

545
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:21,811
Thank you very much, thank you.

546
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:27,212
Finally, we need volunteers,
help to pick out the songs.

547
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:29,878
Yes, you.

548
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,588
Come on yaar!!

549
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:35,256
Gimme a break. I don't know anything
about Indian music.

550
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:37,921
Come on, I just came to talk
to her after the meeting.

551
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:42,428
Pagal! This is your chance.
Don't blow it. Just volunteer.

552
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:46,091
You don't need to know anything about
Indian music. We'll help you.

553
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:51,705
Oh you... in the back...
What is your name?

554
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:56,107
UH... KRIS Krishnagopal Reddy!!
- Thank you KRIS

555
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:08,181
Wow! This is great. We've never
had so much participation.

556
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:14,795
I think this is going
to be great Year.

557
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,798
The theme for this year's garba
will be the Leela Raas.

558
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,971
Now, we need to look at some popular
Hindi movies to get songs.

559
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,970
How about 'Mere Sapno Ki Rani'

560
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:29,635
Oh yeah! How about 'Taal se taal mila.'

561
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,542
Oh that's one of my most favorite songs.

562
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:33,340
And we can't forget 'Kuch, Kuch, Hota Hai'.

563
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:38,249
Of course, and "Tu Cheez Badi Hai Mast Mast..."

564
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:39,981
Oh my God! There are so many songs.

565
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,318
How are we going to choose?
Let's watch Hindi movies to get ideas.

566
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,159
Yes, does anyone have a VCR?

567
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:48,331
Oh! I do. And I have some
Indian tapes too.

568
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,433

569
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:59,309

video of that actor.

570
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:03,445
You mean 'Johnny Walker's Greatest Hits'
- Uh Yeah! That guy.

571
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,873
Great! Why don't we get together
tomorrow at your place and watch it.

572
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:08,551
And I'll pick up some more tapes
from the video store.

573
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:11,186
I've to submit to this to the President.
Are you going back to the Quads?

574
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,754
Yeah! Hurry up and I'll give you
a ride back. - Alright good.

575
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:22,254
Johnny Walker's Greatest Hits.
That's so funny.

576
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:25,233
"Malish... Malish... Tail Malish"

577
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:26,629
What's your problem?

578
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:28,964
I got no problem ABCD?

579
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,864
What did you call me?

580
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:36,979
ABCD! "An American Born Confused Desi."

581
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:40,981
Who are you calling confused?

582
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:47,783
You... Nina's mine. You got it?

583
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:55,721
- Hi! Guys, hey Nina!
Let's go, get some lassi.

584
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,060
Okay, bye Kris.

585
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:12,312
Yo! You mind. Little privacy in here
- Sorry man... Sorry.

586
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:14,975
I don't have any clue about
Indian Culture.

587
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:20,589
This guy Rakesh rattles off Indian songs,
movies like crazy.

588
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:24,321
Have faith in God yaar!

589
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:28,063
Why do you think you got put
into a room full of Indians!

590
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:32,529
Alright Swami.

591
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:36,402
Hurry up, let's go. Get ready.
We should go to library.

592
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:39,074
Salim, I can't today.

593
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,001
I have to get started on these
designs for the Garba.

594
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:43,839
I told them some of my
ideas last night.

595
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:46,311
They want me to decorate
the whole place!

596
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:49,451
THE WHOLE PLACE YAAR!
I can't screw that up.

597
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,281
Hey listen, you go ahead,
I'll catch up with you later.

598
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:16,822
Congratulations man! - Well you know... shit!

599
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:18,927
Hold the elevator. Hold it. Salim! Oh My God.

600
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,642
Hey, What did you get for problem 3?

601
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:32,613
I keep getting 12.87 repeating.

602
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:35,784
Hey, -What?

603
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:39,149
What do you get for 3?
- I... I... I don't know.

604
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:42,216
What are you doing?

605
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,990
I'm Just finishing up this shell
for the garba.

606
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:47,390
You know mid-terms are coming up.
Are you going to be ready?

607
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:51,861
Arey don't worry yaar. I just need to
finish 1 or 2 more things.

608
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,067
Then, I'm here.

609
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:57,700
So Salim, yaar.
How's it going with Farah?

610
00:52:57,908 --> 00:52:59,466
Have you gotten any of the
booty yet?

611
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:02,903
Please! That's the last booty
I would ever touch, Okay.

612
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:06,640
Oh no! Here we go again with the
corrupt Indian girl routine again.

613
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:11,583
That's right. All Indian girls raised
in America become corrupt.

614
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:14,381
You saw Farah at the party!
The way she was dressed.

615
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,081
I can just imagine if her
daddy saw her.

616
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:18,022
Poor guy would have a heart attack.

617
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:20,190
Why don't you give her
a chance, Salim.

618
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:21,625
Maybe, there's more to her
than that.

619
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:24,425
No way! She's been hunting me down
like anything.

620
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:25,999
Everywhere I turn, there she is.

621
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:29,366
In class, at the dining hall,
at that stupid party.

622
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:31,006
I'm already
feeling like I'm married.

623
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,938
Pretty soon, she'll be asking me
to hold her makeup.

624
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:44,048
So? What movies did you get?
- Oh! I got a couple.

625
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:49,089
I got 'Aradhana', 'Sangam',
and 'Tere Mere Sapne'.

626
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:50,418
Do you have any preference?

627
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:56,896
I've seen the first two. So?

628
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:01,435
'Tere Mere Sapne'. That's one of my
all-time favorites. - Yeah.

629
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:03,629
I was going to suggest 'Sangam' because
it's closer to our theme.

630
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,534
But if you've already seen it...

631
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,641
No... No, you're right, I mean right.

632
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,711
That one is definitely closer
to our theme.

633
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:12,404
And its a classic, right?
- Yeah.

634
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,110
Okay, let's see that one.

635
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:18,319
Hey guys... Ready to watch the films?

636
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:20,246
<i>Which pictures did you bring, Nina?</i>

637
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:22,254
Well I got 'Aradhana', 'Sangam',
and 'Tere Mere Sapne'.

638
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:27,489
<i>Alright.</i> '<i>Sangam' is the one</i>
<i>we have to see.</i>

639
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:30,063
<i>That picture is closest</i>
<i>to our theme, no?</i>

640
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:33,327
Yeah, that's what I was telling Kris.
Its closer to our theme.

641
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:38,739
So Yeah! You guys want to go watch the movies?

642
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,409
Yeah! Let's go. - Chalo?

643
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,908
This is going to be fun 9 hours.

644
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,421
It's driving me crazy.

645
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,716
Look! That looks like the Swiss Alps?
Weren't they just in Bombay?

646
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:56,755
Hey. It's been ten minutes.

647
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,155
Aren't they due for another song
and dance sequence?

648
00:55:01,197 --> 00:55:03,927
Oh good. I was starting
to get worried.

649
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:08,127
What is this? The next day?
They've all changed clothes.

650
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:14,435
I've seen porno films with
better story lines, honestly... what?

651
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:20,715
Good job, yaar.

652
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:25,443
Insulting Hindi films and
admitted to watching porno.

653
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,749
May be next time you can casually
mention your bout with gonorrhea?

654
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,200
It's not that difficult, Yaar.

655
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:21,505
You just have to learn to be a
little sensitive to her needs.

656
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:24,043
Nina's a smart girl.
You can't take her for a fool.

657
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:25,839
She's not going to forgive that easily.

658
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,516
Well, what if I take her out to dinner.

659
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:29,346
You know to smooth things out?

660
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,520
You guys know any good Indian
restaurants in the area?

661
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:32,847
I've got a better idea.

662
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:37,356
Why don't you cook a romantic,
delicious Indian dinner?

663
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,753
Yeah, like I can cook
Indian food.

664
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:43,057
I can barely break the bread
with my hands.

665
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:45,461
You mean 'Naan'.
- Non-what?

666
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:47,659
Naan, yo!
- NON-WHAT? YO!

667
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,395
N-double A-N!

668
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,730
You really don't have a clue,
do you?

669
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:54,172
Not to worry yaar. You have us!

670
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:57,306
Can any of you guys know how to
cook Indian food?

671
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:05,052
Hey! How about Gautam?
Remember his 7 course lunch?

672
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,485
You can't get that just anywhere.
He had to have made it himself.

673
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:10,887
Look Kris, you go and pick up a couple
of things at the Indian grocery store.

674
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,558
Ajay, you go back to the room and
prepare the kitchen.

675
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,492
And I will go deliver the invitation.

676
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:18,792
Why don't you get this stuff and
I'll go invite Nina.

677
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:24,306
That's your problem yaar.
You think too much like an American.

678
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:27,340
If you want to get an Indian girl,
You have to think like an Indian.

679
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:29,239
You need to use Indian techniques.

680
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:32,847
You need a go-between. Now GO!

681
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:04,808
Excuse me, sir...
- Oh yes! Uh, can I help you?

682
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:12,983
Could you tell me where the
'Naan' is? - Naan?

683
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:19,953
You go to the back & to the left.

684
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:24,862
And if I may suggest,
you should buy the Roghani brand.

685
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,197
It is the Best quality.

686
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:29,297
- Okay. Thank you.

687
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:30,839
- Oy! Hurry Hurry! Take the sale stickers
off the Roghani Naan. Hurry Hurry.

688
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:54,160
So Nina? Tell me about last night.

689
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,855
I want to hear all the details
about you & Krishna.

690
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:01,603
There are no details. He wasted my time.
I've never been so insulted.

691
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:03,169
Oh My God! What did he do?

692
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:05,465
He lied to me about liking
Indian movies.

693
00:59:05,675 --> 00:59:08,075
And made smart-ass comments all night.

694
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:10,906
I actually put off problems so I could
pick songs for the Garba.

695
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:12,706
What a creep. - Yeah.

696
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:16,314
So, are you going to see him again?
- No. Why?

697
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:18,077
I don't know, he is kinda cute!

698
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:22,682
What's that?
- It's an e-mail... from Jagjit.

699
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:25,550
Listen to this...

700
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:29,158
Loyal friend seeks suitable alliance
for big-mouthed,

701
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:30,832
But well intentioned roommate.

702
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:34,936
19 yrs, 5' 11", currently pursuing
degree in Engineering.

703
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:37,368
US Citizen, caste no bar.

704
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,566
Girl should be open-minded,
and very understanding.

705
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,280
It's always 7.99! Do you want the almonds or not?
- Badmash! Sala!

706
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:55,920
Mr. Naan.

707
00:59:56,859 --> 00:59:57,985
Very good.

708
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:08,403
Hey, What're you doing?

709
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:10,899
You already rang that up.

710
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:15,470
Take the charge off. Sala!
- I'm doing it, okay.

711
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:21,515
Oooooh! That's so cute!

712
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:22,614
Oh My God, you gotta go.

713
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:26,311
No way! It's gonna take a more than a
funny little ad to make up for last night.

714
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:32,261
Okay, how about a romantic
home cooked dinner? - What?

715
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,327
Jagjit?

716
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:46,306
Come by the apartment at 8:00 pm
and prepare to be amazed.

717
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:48,607
And no Indian Standard Time!

718
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:54,682
We will start off with vegetable samosa appetizers
with mint chutney.

719
01:00:54,884 --> 01:00:57,375
This will be followed by the main course
consisting of Malai Kofta...

720
01:00:57,587 --> 01:01:00,112
And a Dum Aloo subzi with
toasted naan.

721
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,450
We will have raita and roasted papadum.

722
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:06,427
Then, we'll have Basmati rice and
a very spicy curry.

723
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:09,826
And for dessert, Gulab Jamun.

724
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,231
Are you sure we can make
all this stuff?

725
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:14,130
May be I should just take Nina out
to an Indian restaurant.

726
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:17,272
Rakesh can take her out to
an Indian restaurant.

727
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:20,504
You are going to create a dinner
that she will not soon forget.

728
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:22,143
Please Gautam-bhai... proceed.

729
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:25,007
Okay, Jagjit you make the samosas.

730
01:01:25,214 --> 01:01:29,150
Kris, you make the curry.
Ajaybhai, roast the papadum.

731
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:30,046
So, what do you want me to do?

732
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:32,084
You can put the rice in the
pressure cooker.

733
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:35,017
Make sure the whistle is on snug and
let it go for 5 whistles.

734
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:36,213
NO MORE!

735
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:41,591
No... No... No...
I don't drink, sorry, no...

736
01:01:42,565 --> 01:01:46,331
Kris, put the curry mix and
some water to boil,

737
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:48,862
And add some red chili pepper.

738
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:53,002
Ah Git's. What would I do without you?

739
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:05,740
He get drunk on one beer?
Now what are we going to do guys?

740
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:13,581
Ouch! Bitch! You better roast
when I say roast! - Big man in the house now!

741
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:39,103
Oh My God!! The rice.
- 5 whistles... No more!

742
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:42,809
Okay, relax.

743
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:17,915
Oh my God! What happened here?
What were you making?

744
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,451
It looks like a war zone in here.

745
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:27,755
Hi Nina. Um... we were cooking and Gautam
got drunk and we didn't know how to...

746
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:30,124
Maybe we could go and get some pizza?

747
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:35,669
I'll change & everything.
- Okay.

748
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:46,509
I don't know what I was thinking.
I should have never listened to Jagjit.

749
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:48,679
Well that was very sweet, Krishna.

750
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:52,587
Listen Nina. Could you please
call me Kris?

751
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:56,024
Sure, but what's wrong with Krishna?
It's such a beautiful name.

752
01:04:56,392 --> 01:05:03,264
I just prefer Kris.
- So Kris. What are you wearing to Garba?

753
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,395
Wear? Well, actually I wasn't
planning on going.

754
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:06,590
Why not? It'll be fun.

755
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:09,870
Nah., I don't know
how to do that dance thing.

756
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,038
Oh come on. Its easy. I can teach you.

757
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:22,242
What is so funny?

758
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:23,118
Nothing.

759
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:24,877
It's bad enough I have to do
this stupid dance.

760
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:27,248
I really don't need criticism
from the peanut gallery?

761
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:29,390
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
anything by it.

762
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:32,493
Just because you have two left feet
doesn't make it stupid dance.

763
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:33,889
May be I shouldn't be dancing.

764
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:46,073
Kris! You're not even trying!
Now pay attention.

765
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:53,742
Oh grow up, Kris! Can't you accept
anything Indian without insulting it?

766
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:57,210
I don't even know why I
bothered to teach you.

767
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:01,089
Come on Nina! I was just kidding.

768
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:06,921
I'm sorry, Okay!

769
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:08,519
Okay!

770
01:06:12,935 --> 01:06:22,606
'Thoodi jo peelee hai'.
- 'Thoodi jo peelee hai'.

771
01:06:23,212 --> 01:06:26,579
Oh! You are going to have one hell
of a hangover tomorrow bhai-sahib.

772
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,977
I hope you have some Ayurvedic
remedy for that.

773
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:30,115
WAIT A MINUTE!

774
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:38,791
Hey Ajay. You can take Gautam home
yourself right? I got to take care of something.

775
01:06:39,061 --> 01:06:41,086
Wait! Come on... No way... Wait.

776
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:45,523
Come on in Jen, the door's open.

777
01:06:51,807 --> 01:06:54,742
I am performing one of nature's duty.

778
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:58,671
This is one of the things,
I miss most about India.

779
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:07,688
The freedom. No bogus rules,
no regulations,

780
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:15,863
Just do what you want freely.
No botheration!

781
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:22,934
Yo! Yo! Yo! Come on man!
Man! Why you gotta go and ruin my sneakers.

782
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:25,067
I paid sixty-dollars for these bitches.

783
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:32,647
Oh Hell... no... Man...
Come on, it's a girls dormitory?

784
01:07:34,283 --> 01:07:36,513
No... No... No...

785
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:55,370
SALIM!?

786
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:58,563
Hi Farah.

787
01:07:59,108 --> 01:07:59,699
EID Mubarak.

788
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:04,538
What do you want?

789
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:09,542
I saw you at mosque
you looked beautiful.

790
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:11,143
I just wanted to...

791
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:16,615
I just wanted to tell you that...
What's the matter?

792
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:17,716
Nothing.

793
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:19,655
So why are you acting like this?

794
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:24,558
Because this is how we 'corrupt
Indian girls in America' act.

795
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:31,404
Oh! You heard me. I'm sorry. I didn't
really mean it the way it sounded.

796
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:42,480
Oh Shit! It's my parents.

797
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:46,988
Now you're really gonna get me
in to so much trouble.

798
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:52,115
Okay, come into in my room.
And don't make a sound.

799
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:07,104
Eid Mubarak! - Oh hello Mummy, Hi Daddy.
What are you doing here?

800
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:09,842
We were driving back from
Fatima Auntie's house.

801
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:12,780
We thought to stop by and
see how you were doing.

802
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,847
Oh, how thoughtful.

803
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,485
Aren't you going to let us in?

804
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:24,719
Okay sure, Come on in.

805
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:37,662
Yo! Where are you man?

806
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:41,967
Come on! We can get into
lot of trouble for this.

807
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:46,811
Man we should not be in here.

808
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:47,983
So, how are your studies going Farah?

809
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:52,018
Oh fine! Today we had a test in Calculus
and I think I got an A.

810
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:53,984
That's nice dear. - Very good.

811
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:56,588
You know you should clean your
kitchen more often.

812
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:59,886
It can get dirty very quickly.
And be sure to use Pinesol.

813
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:02,825
Sure mom. I just haven't had time
last couple of days.

814
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:12,498
What was what?

815
01:10:15,277 --> 01:10:16,369
I didn't hear anything.

816
01:10:28,824 --> 01:10:32,089
Ah! Cool! Drumstick now you're
talking my language.

817
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:37,354
These are dandias. - Dandias. They are
used in the Raas which comes after the garba.

818
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:39,431
Okay you'll like this dance.
It's a little easier on the feet.

819
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:41,829
So now just hit my stick back hand.

820
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:46,274
Now swing your body,

821
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:47,474
And the other one. Yes

822
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:52,213
Look at my eyes
not the tits okay.

823
01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:03,315
Are you okay?

824
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:17,870
Ow! What was that for? - What do you
think you're doing? - What?

825
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:18,865
How dare you!

826
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,132
It was just a kiss.

827
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:22,433
How typical. Get out of here.

828
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:24,902
You're the one who invited me here.

829
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:29,273
To dance, I figured it'd be nice to learn
something about your own culture.

830
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:33,581
My culture! What do want me to learn?

831
01:11:33,856 --> 01:11:37,383
That I come from a country where the
concept of toilet paper is still a myth.

832
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:40,451
And let their parents decide
who their going to marry.

833
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:42,094
Uhhhh! Your such a... - What?

834
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:45,262
What do you gonna call me, Nina?
An ABCD.

835
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:51,239
Here! Take your sticks.
Have fun at the garba.

836
01:11:52,074 --> 01:11:53,268
Why don't you go with Rakesh!

837
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:57,275
May be can teach you about origins of
garba in India during the last Ice Age.

838
01:11:58,347 --> 01:11:59,109
Have fun!

839
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:09,287
Farah? You didn't tell us
you had a Muslim roommate.

840
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:14,285
Feroz, this is Mumtaz. Did you know
that she is also from Lucknow?

841
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:18,455
Really? Beti, where do your
parents live & what do they do?

842
01:12:18,701 --> 01:12:22,330
Uh well actually my parents
live in India.

843
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:24,639
I'm here studying on a student visa.

844
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,307
I have to go now before
the mosque closes.

845
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:29,636
Well, beti. You just think of us as your parents.

846
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:33,014
Um... well thank you auntie and uncle.

847
01:12:33,382 --> 01:12:36,818
You are quite a beautiful
young girl Mumtaz.

848
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:43,016
If you're interested, I know a fine
young boy, he could be a great match for you.

849
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:45,293
I think that's a great idea!

850
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:50,587
Oh Thank you auntie but I don't think
I'm ready yet. I'm still in school.

851
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:55,233
Oh nonsense, you don't want to reach your
late 20's and not be married, do you?

852
01:12:56,238 --> 01:12:58,570
You'll have to settle for those
Old men,

853
01:12:58,741 --> 01:13:00,641
Who advertise in newspapers!

854
01:13:00,976 --> 01:13:05,072
You are too young to understand. Give me your
parents phone number in Lucknow.

855
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:09,942
Actually, Mumtaz's parents
don't have a phone.

856
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:16,021
So, I'll get her parent's address
and send it to you mummy, okay?

857
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:20,293
Mumtaz, you better hurry
& go to the Mosque.

858
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:21,824
Okay. Yes, hurry beti.

859
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:24,225
It was nice meeting you auntie, uncle.

860
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:25,525
Bye Farah!

861
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:36,037
Oh I'm sorry Miss! Please don't tell
anyone we're here. It was an accident.

862
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:37,075
Chutiya, It's me.

863
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:39,213
Salim?

864
01:13:39,848 --> 01:13:41,782
Relax, I can explain everything,
okay!

865
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:45,576
No man! It's cool! I'm down with
alternative lifestyles.

866
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:48,279
Niggah gotta do, what a niggah gotta do,
- Excuse me.

867
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:53,394
I didn't know Hijros could
immigrate to the US.

868
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:56,421
What kind of visa are you on?

869
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:57,465
Come on!!

870
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:00,893
Wait a minute. I think I'm going
to throw up.

871
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:05,403
Well wait a minute. Don't do it here.
Wait. Come Here. - Let's go to bathroom.

872
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:08,207
Not on the bhurka.

873
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:17,577
(screams) Go... Go!

874
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:35,260
Please forgive me Bhagwan!!
Please forgive me Bhagwan!

875
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:39,934
Yo! Bhai-saab! You alright? Guess they
don't have panty raids in India huh?

876
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:46,536
Are you wearing mascara?

877
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:50,919
Don't ask, how's the date with Nina?

878
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:53,485
Don't ask I knew this was
not going to work out.

879
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:54,621
We have nothing in common.

880
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:58,088
If I dry clean it, won't it stink like
Gautam's piss.

881
01:15:03,298 --> 01:15:08,292
Is it Engineering?
Father, I'll become an engineer.

882
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:15,799
What happened? This place looks worse
than South Central!

883
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:16,636
Are you alright?

884
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:18,608
Come on yaar, it's okay
It'll be alright.

885
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:20,906
What man! What will be alright?

886
01:15:21,717 --> 01:15:25,244
That I have to spend the rest of my life
designing buildings the job I hate.

887
01:15:26,054 --> 01:15:27,180
That's what you call alright!

888
01:15:31,493 --> 01:15:34,985
I knew, he was going to eventually find out
and that he never understands.

889
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:37,593
I don't want to see this
stuff anymore.

890
01:15:37,866 --> 01:15:39,663
Don't say that man.
This is your dream.

891
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:41,460
Don't ever give up on that.

892
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:43,831
Yeah man what! Like Spike Lee says...
You know

893
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:47,475
"Make Black Films...
By Any Means Necessary!"

894
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:51,869
You're really good at this.
You know that!

895
01:15:54,383 --> 01:16:00,754
Well. You know. Shit.

896
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:40,552
Great Party? You know I just
love Indian culture.

897
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:46,428
I mean I've read the Kama Sutra from
cover to cover ten times.

898
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:49,863
I'm memorized every position

899
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:56,302
Yeah! Well you know, somebody in
my family wrote that book.

900
01:16:57,412 --> 01:17:04,318
Now, I'm working on a follow-up. It's called
the 'Ajay Sutra'.

901
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:09,352
Well! I'd love to hear more about it.

902
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:13,759
Well, I might just have to show...
- Arey Yaar! This is my song!

903
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:15,554
Come on man!
- Yo! What ya doing?

904
01:17:34,282 --> 01:17:35,840
Ho... Ho... Ho! Hey Man! Who you callin' a ho!!!

905
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:25,491
You know I just love Indian culture.

906
01:18:27,002 --> 01:18:32,668
I've read the Kama Sutra from
cover to cover ten times.

907
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:35,173
So you know about VENUDARITIKA?

908
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:37,602
What? What's that?

909
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:40,844
It means 'Splitting The Bamboo'.

910
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:45,646
It's a highly erotic position and
pleasurable for the woman.

911
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:52,120
Really? That sounds interesting.
Maybe you can teach me.

912
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:56,694
Actually, I learned it from my friend
over there, Kris.

913
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:59,362
He's a master, when it comes
to the Kama Sutra.

914
01:18:59,868 --> 01:19:02,530
Why don't you talk to him?
I'm sure he'd love to teach you.

915
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:03,864
I may just do that.

916
01:19:23,558 --> 01:19:25,719
Hey Nina! Have you been here long?

917
01:19:26,061 --> 01:19:28,552
The party is top. What are you
doing with your stuff?

918
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:30,959
Go... put it in the bedroom.
Let's go & dance.

919
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:36,594
Come here!

920
01:19:56,691 --> 01:19:58,181
Wait... Nina wait!

921
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:15,769
Leaving so soon?

922
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:20,178
Nina! Wait! Let me explain.
- Go away!

923
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:23,808
Look. I'm sorry.

924
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:25,952
Let me go. I thought you were different.

925
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:27,985
I don't know what happened
back there... I mean.

926
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:29,852
May be I had a little too much
to drink or something.

927
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:31,525
Oh so that's supposed to
make it alright!

928
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,128
I'm sorry but I just can't
accept that as an excuse.

929
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:36,456
Maybe I'm old-fashioned
and traditional.

930
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:38,963
Maybe I'm a little too Indian for
your taste!

931
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:43,126
Too Indian?! Why does it always
have to be about Indian culture?

932
01:20:43,805 --> 01:20:46,239
Why? - Why can't it be just us?

933
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:47,769
Because I'm Indian.

934
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:51,935
Since you can't stand anything Indian
there's no us!

935
01:21:52,207 --> 01:21:59,545
Oh come on Sri! I can't!
Because I can't just fly to Bombay.

936
01:22:00,448 --> 01:22:04,441
Don't you've a movie shoot? I know I got
exams, I just can't leave, You know.

937
01:22:09,157 --> 01:22:15,062
Ajay! Ajay! - What! What! Oh man,
I was having a dream.

938
01:22:15,563 --> 01:22:17,895
Me & Sridevi were dancing in the rain.

939
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:22,468
Well sorry to disturb your wet dream but
you know how to do that dance right?

940
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:23,999
What dance?

941
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:25,265
The 'Garba'.

942
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,767
No, I only know how to do the Raas.

943
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:29,805
Can you teach it to me?

944
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:33,344
Sure, no problem man.

945
01:22:36,718 --> 01:22:37,707
Can you teach it to me now?

946
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:41,915
Now? - Yeah please.

947
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:44,552
Man! - Come on, man.

948
01:22:47,595 --> 01:22:48,357
Thanks man.

949
01:22:51,099 --> 01:22:52,327
Soan I ask you a question?

950
01:22:53,168 --> 01:22:56,604
Why the Afro-centric Hindu homeboy thing?

951
01:22:57,439 --> 01:22:58,701
I'm just trying to keep it real.

952
01:22:58,907 --> 01:23:01,501
Blacks and Indians have a hell of alot
more in common than you may think.

953
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:03,539
We share a common ancestry.

954
01:23:04,245 --> 01:23:05,439
Did you know that India used
to be a part of Africa?

955
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:06,113
What?

956
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:07,679
You've got be kidding me.

957
01:23:07,882 --> 01:23:09,281
No, I'm serious. Go grab some dandias and learn.

958
01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:12,212
You know about
Plate Tectonics, right?

959
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:17,414
Oh yeah! The theory that all land masses are
sitting on plates that are moving.

960
01:23:18,226 --> 01:23:23,789
Yeah. Well haven't you noticed how
the west coast of India,

961
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:27,066
Once upon a time we were
one land dawg, one people,

962
01:23:28,069 --> 01:23:30,629
But then India drifted East
and hit the Asian landmass.

963
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:36,137
And Gujarat, where my parents are from used to
be part of Kenya or Tanzania so,

964
01:23:36,911 --> 01:23:39,243
So Damn! I'm just rediscovering my
original roots, you know?

965
01:23:39,948 --> 01:23:41,643
Come... On! - And you actually
believe this stuff?

966
01:23:41,883 --> 01:23:44,351
Yo man. Are we not down with
music and dance?

967
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:46,611
Don't we kick ass in Cricket?

968
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:50,485
And don't forget the biggest similarity
we have with our African brothers.

969
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:51,351
Yeah! What's that? Right here.

970
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:28,486
Hey! Kiddah! Sherah!! What's happening man?

971
01:25:29,057 --> 01:25:31,252
This is amazing, I can't believe you did this.

972
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:34,087
- Yeah... You know man, shit!

973
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:36,923
No... No... Not shit... Dope yaar?

974
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:39,930
It's really amazing
- This is phenomenal, Jagjit.

975
01:25:53,448 --> 01:25:59,284
May be this wasn't a good idea look!
- Yaar jubhos looking tight, yo.

976
01:26:02,724 --> 01:26:03,520
Hi Farah!

977
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:05,451
Hi.

978
01:26:07,428 --> 01:26:08,918
Thanks for covering for me
the other night.

979
01:26:09,264 --> 01:26:11,323
When I dropped your CD's on the floor
I just paniced.

980
01:26:11,633 --> 01:26:13,794
I thought your parents were going
to send me to Lucknow right then.

981
01:26:16,304 --> 01:26:17,236
You really saved me.

982
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:21,268
Can you imagine being trapped all day
long by some sexist ego-centric guy.

983
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:23,340
Mumtaz! Don't you even know
how to boil rice?

984
01:26:29,651 --> 01:26:30,948
I know this is going to sound crazy.

985
01:26:31,152 --> 01:26:34,986
But the other night was the first time
I really thought about.

986
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:36,657
What it must be like to be
an Indian woman.

987
01:26:38,826 --> 01:26:40,157
I'm really sorry about what I said.

988
01:26:41,462 --> 01:26:42,486
I hope you can forgive me.

989
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:47,996
I'll have to think about it.

990
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:52,904
You know, we corrupt Indian girls
don't forgive so easily.

991
01:26:58,513 --> 01:26:59,639
But you know what would
make it easier?

992
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:00,847
What?

993
01:27:02,417 --> 01:27:04,078
If I could get my dress back?

994
01:27:05,453 --> 01:27:06,010
Oh yeah, right.

995
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:08,689
Actually, I've gotten quite
attached to it.

996
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:11,859
I was planning on wearing, when I meet
that guy your mother has set up for me.

997
01:27:24,872 --> 01:27:26,533
Kris! Dude! What's going on?

998
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:30,040
Eric? What are you doing here?

999
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:33,703
Dude! I think I've almost got enough
money to pay for this year's tuition.

1000
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:36,542
Oh Uncle...

1001
01:28:06,781 --> 01:28:09,807
Krishna, I want you to meet
my classmate, Jackie.

1002
01:28:10,218 --> 01:28:14,086
Jackie, this is one of my students,
Krishna... I mean Kris Reddy.

1003
01:28:14,856 --> 01:28:15,686
Namaste!

1004
01:28:16,624 --> 01:28:20,151
Uh yeah! - Come on Jackie,
let's go & dance.

1005
01:28:30,838 --> 01:28:33,602
Hey guys! Raas! Come on, let's go.

1006
01:30:01,929 --> 01:30:03,396
Hey Ajay! Switch with me man.

1007
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:51,902
Wait here one minute...!
- Where are you going?

1008
01:31:07,962 --> 01:31:08,587
Hi Nina.

1009
01:31:13,334 --> 01:31:14,926
Kris. What the fuck are you doing here Kris?

1010
01:31:15,369 --> 01:31:17,394
I have no hard feeling with you.
I just came here to...

1011
01:31:17,872 --> 01:31:18,770
RAKESH stop!

1012
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:20,801
Hey! I didn't come here to fight.

1013
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:26,605
Rakesh?! What are you doing?
- Yeah, well I did.

1014
01:32:29,744 --> 01:32:32,736
Like I said, I didn't
come here to fight.

1015
01:32:37,518 --> 01:32:40,817
Hi, just wanted to thank you all
for being here tonight.

1016
01:32:41,222 --> 01:32:44,851
This is a record turn out
for the club.

1017
01:32:46,027 --> 01:32:46,493
Are you okay?

1018
01:32:47,194 --> 01:32:51,028
Yeah, I'm fine. I really
didn't want to fight...

1019
01:32:51,866 --> 01:32:52,264
I know.

1020
01:32:53,167 --> 01:32:56,261
Well. I better be going.
- Kris, I'm sorry!

1021
01:32:57,738 --> 01:32:58,204
What?

1022
01:32:59,674 --> 01:33:00,538
I said, I'm sorry.

1023
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:02,372
You're sorry?

1024
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:05,078
Yeah. I was just thinking how
mean I was to you.

1025
01:33:05,846 --> 01:33:09,043
I didn't try to see it from your side
so I guess, I was being selfish and for that.

1026
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:09,716
I'm sorry.

1027
01:33:10,952 --> 01:33:13,147
Nina! No, I'm the one who was selfish.

1028
01:33:13,354 --> 01:33:15,083
I wasn't being sensitive
you were right.

1029
01:33:15,289 --> 01:33:19,191
You know I was being an ass. I'm the one
who should be saying "I'm Sorry."

1030
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:20,060
Okay.

1031
01:33:21,095 --> 01:33:21,720
Okay?

1032
01:33:24,265 --> 01:33:24,731
What?

1033
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,400
Okay. I accept your apology.
All you had to do was say it.

1034
01:33:28,669 --> 01:33:29,863
What? I don't get it.

1035
01:33:30,504 --> 01:33:34,565
Well, it's not everyday a good looking
Indian guy apologizes for his behavior.

1036
01:33:34,775 --> 01:33:38,404
A girl's got to take them when she can.
Who knows when it'll happen again?

1037
01:33:38,879 --> 01:33:43,179
Cute. Very cute. That's a clever line.
Where'd you pick it up?

1038
01:33:43,684 --> 01:33:47,984
You know this ABCD tried to
use it on me once. It was so pathetic.

1039
01:33:52,226 --> 01:33:55,889
Shabash! Just like in the movies.

1040
01:33:56,163 --> 01:33:58,961
The hero beats the villain and
saves beautiful heroine.

1041
01:33:59,166 --> 01:34:01,430
Tick! Tock! Just like a Hindi filim?

1042
01:34:04,071 --> 01:34:08,440
So, let's get on with Raas, yaar?

1043
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:12,275
There's one person in particular
that I'd like to thank.

1044
01:34:12,913 --> 01:34:16,781
Without whose hard work, dedication
and talents,

1045
01:34:16,984 --> 01:34:20,784
This beautiful night would not
have been possible.

1046
01:34:21,322 --> 01:34:25,349
Lets give a big round of applause
to Mr. Jagjit Singh

1047
01:34:44,545 --> 01:34:49,778
So putra, did you use the gear system or
pulley leverage for the arms?

1048
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:53,814
The gear system, pappaji.

1049
01:35:16,444 --> 01:35:18,105
So Nina. May I have the honor
of this dance?

1050
01:35:18,946 --> 01:35:20,846
You want to dance? Bhangra?

1051
01:35:22,216 --> 01:35:22,682
Yeah!

1052
01:35:23,484 --> 01:35:26,009
Oh! Unless it's too Indian for you?

1053
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:28,017
No, please let's go!
