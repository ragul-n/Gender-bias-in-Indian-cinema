00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,291
Wow! A star fruit.

2
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,416
Dad, here is the hot water.
Take your bath.

00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,833
You're coming home
for the holidays, aren't you?

6
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,791
<span style="style.default_1">Nurses don't get many holidays.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Can't say.</span>

7
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,250
-Is it?
-<span style="style.default_1">Yes.</span>

8
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:12,458
Damn! I want to see you.

9
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,125
All right. Have you had your dinner?

10
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,000
<span style="style.default_1">Yeah, I had my dinner.</span>

11
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,625
Shall I go with my dad
and talk to your parents about us?

12
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:30,333
<span style="style.default_1">No! Don't you worry about all that.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I'll talk to them when I can.</span>

13
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,875
Then come home soon.

14
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:35,208
<span style="style.default_1">I would love to come home, Mahesh,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but I should get a leave first.</span>

15
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,583
<span style="style.default_1">Okay, I'll catch up later.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I have to get to work.</span>

16
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:38,666
Hey!

17
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,208
<span style="style.default_1">What?</span>

18
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,583
Give me a kiss.

19
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,291
<span style="style.default_1">Okay, take care. Bye.</span>

20
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,500
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, my love</span>

21
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,375
<span style="style.default_1">Talk to me, my dear</span>

22
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,000
Dad...

23
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,375
Dad, come on, let's eat.

24
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,166
Dad?

25
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,458
Dad?

26
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,500
Dad?

27
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,291
Don't move.

28
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,500
You moved when Rohit
was batting last time.

29
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,875
And he got out.

30
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,500
-Hello.
<span style="style.default_1">-Babji, my dad is missing.</span>

31
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,291
-Missing?
<span style="style.default_1">-Yes. I called him for--</span>

32
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,750
-Did you search the whole house?
<span style="style.default_1">-Yes, he's nowhere.</span>

33
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,625
Damn! He got out.
I told you not to move.

34
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,000
Keep quiet.

35
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,458
I'm coming there.

36
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,916
Did you inquire with your relatives?

37
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,291
I called up all the relatives
in the village.

38
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:48,625
No one saw him.

39
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,125
Maybe he's gone out of town
to meet someone.

40
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,583
We have no relatives
outside this village, sir.

41
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:57,000
That's not possible.
How can that be?

42
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,583
It's true, sir.
His parents had a love marriage.

43
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:04,250
His father left his family and moved here
as they didn't agree to his marriage.

44
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,000
And he never went back.

45
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:11,375
-Did he ever go missing like this before?
-No, this is the first time.

46
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,500
Did you search the nearby wells and lakes?

47
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:18,875
Goddess Durga, bring back my dad,
and I'll walk on burning coal as penance.

48
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,208
Mahesh, calm down.

49
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:26,333
Sir, I think we should contact
the Odisha police--

50
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,125
Babji, hold on.

51
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:33,791
Sir, I suspect that Mr. Manohar
is mentally unstable.

52
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,333
It's your turn, old man.

53
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,291
This world is so beautiful.

54
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,791
What? Have you lost your mind?

55
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,583
Babji, you are beautiful too.

56
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,625
All right.
I think you are doing just fine.

57
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:12,833
Come on, joker.

58
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,458
Damn.

59
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,666
Sir, I need to tell you something too.

60
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,791
What's that?

61
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,125
We need to contact
the Odisha police immediately.

62
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,250
What for?

63
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,625
Once, Mr. Manohar and I
were sitting in my shop...

64
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:49,625
Are you looking for an empty space
on the wall to hang your photo?

65
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:55,416
Babji, we both used to attend
those raunchy dance shows in Chuchukonda.

66
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,625
Do you remember?

67
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,375
How can I forget?
They had always been a feast for the eyes.

68
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,750
I want to see it one more time.
Shall we go?

69
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,916
They have stopped performing
in Chuchukonda.

70
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:12,291
If we go to Jeypore in Odisha, we can
watch new shows featuring new girls.

71
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,208
Transport is available from Padwa.

72
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,125
I too would like to go there.

73
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,250
Why don't we plan a trip?

74
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:25,791
<span style="style.default_1">Would you like to unzip my dress?</span>

75
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,291
Don't look at me like that.

76
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:32,291
We shouldn't lie to the doctors
and the police.

77
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,708
Such secrets won't help us
in this situation. I had to tell him.

78
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,541
Okay, I'll investigate and let you know.

79
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,083
Don't panic in the meantime.
You can go now.

80
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,208
Thank you, Officer.

81
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,166
Sir, please search harder.

82
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:52,125
Sir, if you can't find him,
please contact the Odisha police.

83
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:15,541
Dad?

84
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,541
Dad.

85
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,250
-What are you doing here?
-What's the matter, son?

86
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,791
I couldn't find you. I was so worried.

87
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,458
You fool. There's nothing to worry about.

88
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,166
Mahesh, where are you?

89
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,041
Here... Here I am.

90
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,708
Everyone thinks
that you have gone crazy, Dad.

91
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,708
What were you doing in the bushes?

92
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,750
I was looking out for birds.

93
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:03,625
Get some sleep, Dad.

94
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,375
Make some room, Dad.

95
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,083
Who is it?

96
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:49,625
My name is Suhas.
I'm here to meet Mr. Babji.

97
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,916
Dad is taking a bath. Please come in.

98
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,041
-Can I leave my slippers here?
-Yeah, leave them there.

99
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,166
Are you a fan of NTR?

100
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,583
No. I love Mahesh Babu.

101
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:16,666
I am a fan of NTR.

102
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,000
Mahesh Babu kills his villains
without even moving his feet. Very lazy.

103
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:24,041
But NTR hunts the villains down. So crazy.

104
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,916
Hey, don't call him lazy.
Mahesh is a classy man.

105
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,458
My guy is a hero to the masses.
Look at him take that bad guy out.

106
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,958
That's my man.

107
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,541
The bad guys shudder when he enters.

108
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,750
-Who's that?
-Mr. Babji.

109
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,791
Dad, go put a shirt on.
Don't come in half-naked.

110
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:51,750
Greetings, sir.

111
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,500
-Are you Korra Bujayya's son?
-Yes.

112
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:54,666
Come on.

113
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,541
Your dad told me everything.

114
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,583
What did you use to do before?

115
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,916
I used to sell Bamboo chicken
near the Borra Caves.

116
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,791
-Then why did you stop that?
-Once it used to be a special dish.

117
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,958
Now every jobless guy in the village
is selling Bamboo chicken.

118
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:14,041
Whatever I do, I want it to be special.

119
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:18,375
I want to learn traditional bone setting
from you and become a specialist one day.

120
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,291
Your hair looks like
the tail of a wild gecko.

121
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,125
What happened on this side?

122
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,708
Suffered lice bites in my childhood.
Hair doesn't grow much here.

123
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,125
Damn! Oh, God!

124
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,708
Can't you see that I'm in pain?

125
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,583
Don't you have compassion
for a man who's suffering?

126
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:51,000
How can I set bones
if I show compassion, sir?

127
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,375
Come and meet me at the clinic tomorrow.

128
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:56,958
-Okay.
-Listen.

129
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,416
I am heading towards the town.
I'll drop you.

130
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,708
Oh, God. The guy is so weird.

131
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,833
Hello, Mr. Venkat Rao.
Cutting jackfruits?

132
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,583
No, I'm laying eggs.
Want some?

133
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,208
No, thanks. You can have them.

134
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,666
This 80-year-old prick is quite sarcastic.

135
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,041
Maybe the east wind is affecting his mind.

136
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,375
Rather than roaming around like a lunatic,

137
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,041
why don't you take care
of my banana plantation?

138
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,208
Yeah, sure.

139
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,125
Hey, Karuna! How are you?

140
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,291
-I'm doing good. How are you?
-Great.

141
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,625
Mahesh, I need passport-size photos.

142
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,458
Come on. Let's click some great photos.

143
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,916
I heard that you're moving back to India.

144
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,500
I want to move back here.

145
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,333
But not right now.

146
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,458
I bought farmland
with a loan from the bank.

147
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,166
I have to work abroad
until I can repay it.

148
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,125
Oh.

149
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,750
What about you?
When are you getting married?

150
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,375
-I'll most likely get married this year.
-Don't delay it.

151
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,083
People might start talking about you.
You're already 30.

152
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:14,125
You got married at 25 and got two kids.

153
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,375
We can't live our lives if our decisions
are dependent on others' opinions.

154
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:20,083
-We have a coat.
-Don't need it. You carry on.

155
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,750
Please sit.

156
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:28,625
Sit.

157
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,000
Please look here.

158
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,625
Chandru, this is a passport-size photo.
Come here.

159
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,500
Come on.

160
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,208
Chin down, a little bit.

161
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,000
That's you.

162
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,708
I made you look a little fairer.

163
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,958
You look handsome.

164
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:17,583
Let's go.

165
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,541
Bye.

166
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,083
Babji, shall we have lunch?

167
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:27,125
I'm with a patient. It's almost done.

168
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:32,708
Keep in mind, this bandage
must stay on for 30 days.

169
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,958
-If it starts hurting, call me.
-Okay.

170
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,125
Or just come here.

171
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,833
-What did you cook?
-Tapioca fry.

172
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,166
-Serve me some.
-Yeah, please have it.

173
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:50,125
What was your dad doing in the bushes
when you found him?

174
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:51,958
Looking for birds...

175
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,958
-I have no idea.
-Don't worry.

176
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:59,208
It's because of his old age.
You need to keep an eye on him.

177
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,583
Venkat Rao is amazing.

178
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,500
He's older than your dad.

179
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,583
He still climbs jackfruit trees
to cut fruits.

180
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,125
He's quite strong even at the age of 80.

181
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,250
But he's such a sarcastic jerk.

182
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:20,125
I hope he falls out of a tree one day,
breaks his leg,

183
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,208
and comes to me for treatment.

184
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,458
Who is that Venkat Rao?

185
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,000
Are you kidding me?

186
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,166
He's your girlfriend's uncle.
Venkat Rao.

187
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,500
Mahesh. Hey, Mahesh.

188
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:43,833
What happened?

189
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,416
Your girlfriend's uncle, Venkata Rao...
He fell from a tree.

190
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,041
Did he break his leg?

191
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,083
No. He broke his head
and died on the spot.

192
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,500
He never wanted to be photographed.

193
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,750
Now his family doesn't have
any picture of his.

194
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,250
They want you to take photos
of his mortal remains.

195
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:05,750
I'm coming.

196
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,333
Babji, I'm going there.
Are you coming?

197
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,541
Yeah, I'm coming.

198
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,166
Children, I told you to collect funds
for tsunami relief.

199
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,625
-Did you do it?
-Yes, ma'am.

200
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:32,000
Okay, come one by one and submit
the money. Let's start with the boys.

201
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,916
Swathi, how much did you collect?

202
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,250
I haven't collected anything, Mahesh.

203
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,375
I'll tell you what.
I have collected 300 rupees.

204
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,500
Let's split it in half.

205
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,458
The others will laugh at us
for collecting such a small amount.

206
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,208
It's okay. You can take the entire 300.

207
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,041
It's your turn.

208
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:22,666
-I haven't collected a dime, ma'am.
-Nothing at all? Wastrel.

209
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,333
Sit down.

210
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,250
-Mom, walk fast.
-Yeah, I'm trying.

211
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,416
They have already started it.

212
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,333
Careful, dear.

213
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,333
You didn't leave yet, Babji?

214
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,916
I stayed back, in case
you needed some help.

215
00:25:47,791 --> 00:25:51,083
He was quite good at climbing trees.
He had a strong physique.

216
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:53,416
-Is the cooking done?
-20 more minutes.

217
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,083
Just recently...

218
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:58,166
Want to have a drink, Babji?

219
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:00,875
Are you blind? I am working.
You can carry on.

220
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:27,916
He wanted me to work out and become fit.

221
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,625
So that we could have kids again.
And now he dropped dead.

222
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:33,833
I've got a call from the hospital.
I have to take this.

223
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,458
-Is she here on leave?
-Yes.

224
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:37,791
-Did she fly here?
-Yes.

225
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:40,541
The old jerk's death disrupted
all our lives.

226
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,291
Why did he have to climb trees?

227
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:44,208
<span style="style.default_1">It's me, darling.</span>

228
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:46,208
What is it?

229
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:48,750
<span style="style.default_1">Just come to the backyard.</span>

230
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:52,166
Now? No way.
What if someone sees me sneaking out?

231
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,541
<span style="style.default_1">Babji will distract their attention.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Don't worry. Just come.</span>

232
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,416
How can I?
There are many people here.

233
00:26:58,958 --> 00:27:00,625
<span style="style.default_1">Watch what happens there now.</span>

234
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:05,625
Mister, shall I remove this?

235
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,708
-Yeah, go on.
-Okay.

236
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,541
"Action."

237
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:35,750
-What happened?
-He's having a heart attack.

238
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:37,333
Babji...

239
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,333
Let's get him into my ambulance.

240
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:41,541
He might die
before he reaches the hospital.

241
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:42,791
Put him on that table.

242
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:44,833
-Careful...
-Look out.

243
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:47,083
-Hold his leg.
-Careful.

244
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,541
-Babji, are you okay?
-What happened to him?

245
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,375
Move aside. Let me take a look.

246
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:55,000
-What happened?
-Looks like gastric pain.

247
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:57,916
In that case, he should be holding
his stomach, not his heart.

248
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,916
It's a heart attack.
We need to carry out CPR.

249
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,250
-What the hell is CPR?
-I'll show you.

250
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:05,541
I handled lots of such cases
when I was in the army.

251
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:07,500
Don't panic.

252
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:08,916
Spread out the arms.

253
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,541
Not yours, fools! His arms.

254
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:15,125
When I tell you,
press your mouth against his

255
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:16,958
-and blow air into his mouth.
-Okay.

256
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:18,583
Don't put your mouth against mine.

257
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:20,083
Watch me and learn.

258
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:22,416
Unbutton the shirt,
and make sure he gets air.

259
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,708
Now you need to give compressions
on his chest.

260
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:29,375
Don't press so hard. He might die.

261
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:33,083
Mahesh?

262
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:36,625
Mahesh?

263
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:41,125
Where are you taking me?
I'm not wearing my slippers.

264
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:43,916
Ants bit my legs.

265
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,291
Why did you come now?
There are many people here.

266
00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:49,958
We'll be done for if someone sees us.

267
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:53,833
-Did you eat anything?
-No. I just had some tea.

268
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,625
-What's that?
-Your favorite snacks.

269
00:28:57,708 --> 00:28:58,958
Wow!

270
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,541
It's been so long since I ate this.

271
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:07,958
-Tastes good? I made them for you.
-Tastes great.

272
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:11,750
You have completely
turned into a Hyderabadi girl.

273
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:19,583
I missed you, Swathi.

274
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:32,541
Shut up!
I might puke my heart out. Stop!

275
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:34,875
Oh, God. This is not helping.
Give him mouth-to-mouth.

276
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:38,208
No mouth-to-mouth.
No...

277
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:46,708
See how my CPR saved him.

278
00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:48,333
Shut the hell up.
CPR, my foot!

279
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,791
Let's take him to the hospital
in my ambulance.

280
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:54,208
I'm all right. It's just the spicy dishes
I ate for dinner.

281
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:55,583
It gave me this gastric trouble.

282
00:29:58,083 --> 00:29:59,916
Do you want me to drop you at home?

283
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,625
No, thanks! You've already dropped
a whole lot of crap in my mouth.

284
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,625
Taking alcohol after CPR
produces side effects.

285
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:14,041
I said that it's just a gastric problem.

286
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,666
You guys didn't listen to me
and kept thumping his chest.

287
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:18,500
Now enjoy the aroma as he breaks wind.

288
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:23,875
Those bastards thumped my chest
as if it were a punching bag.

289
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:27,250
Hey!

290
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:30,000
Thanks, Babji.
It worked out well.

291
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,875
Take your hand off me.

292
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:36,000
You are still breathing
because I came up with this stupid idea.

293
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:39,625
If they had continued
with their treatment,

294
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:42,416
I might have farted my life out.

295
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:58,375
Get inside the house.

296
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,166
Dear.

297
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,666
David Raju has found you a suitor.

298
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:21,708
They are from Paderu. David says
that they are a really nice family.

299
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:24,583
The boy is an engineer in America.

300
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,125
They want to come here and see you.

301
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:31,208
I said that I needed to ask you first.

302
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,875
I really think it's a great match.

303
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:37,916
You are educated and have much more
worldly wisdom than I do.

304
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:41,500
Do you want to live your entire life here,
eating your favorite snacks?

305
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:47,208
Or do you want to go around the world
and enjoy your life?

306
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:48,708
Think about it.

307
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:08,291
<span style="style.default_1">Hail Goddess Durga</span>

308
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:12,291
<span style="style.default_1">Hail Goddess Durga</span>

309
00:32:57,416 --> 00:32:58,666
Suhas.

310
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:02,416
Suvas... It means a nice aroma, right?

311
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,708
No, sir.

312
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:06,250
It's Suhas. It means a good laugh.

313
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:09,750
Whatever.

314
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:11,958
If anyone gets into a fight in this town,

315
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,333
or meets with an accident,

316
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:14,916
or slips in the bathroom,

317
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,708
or falls from a tree
and breaks his bone...

318
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,500
Do you know what they scream?

319
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,208
They scream my name.

320
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,916
It's nothing new.

321
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,791
My family is well-known for practicing
traditional bone setting.

322
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:31,000
That's my grandfather, Guruji.

323
00:33:31,416 --> 00:33:34,000
The pioneer who treated white people
back in those days.

324
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:36,666
That's my father, Pedda Brahmaji.

325
00:33:36,916 --> 00:33:39,125
That's my uncle, Chinna Brahmaji.

326
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,166
And then, this Babji.

327
00:33:42,166 --> 00:33:46,333
You are lucky to learn the skills
from a teacher like me.

328
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,375
Take blessings from those teachers first.

329
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:51,875
And then from this teacher.

330
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:53,375
And get to work.

331
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:58,916
Dad, give me hundred rupees.

332
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,208
Hundred rupees?

333
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:01,708
What for?

334
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:08,958
I have given you a job
since I know your dad.

335
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:12,500
Know your limits
and keep away from trouble, okay?

336
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,916
-Babji, please watch over my shop.
-Where are you going?

337
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:23,041
-There is a wedding in a nearby town.
-I'm going there to take photos.

338
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:24,208
Careful, it might rain.

339
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:26,208
Do you recognize me? I'm Suhas.

340
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:31,333
You scored 20 runs in the final over
in a cricket match in Hukumpet.

341
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:34,916
-Yes.
-I bowled that over.

342
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,291
-You are Korra Prabhas's...
-I'm Korra Suhas, his brother.

343
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:41,208
We played on the ground
next to the power station.

344
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:43,791
As my friends were blaming me
for losing the match,

345
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:46,333
you gave back the money
we bet on that game.

346
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:48,541
I wanted to thank you right then,
but I couldn't.

347
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:51,000
It's okay.

348
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,708
-What's with that hairstyle?
-This is the new hairstyle in Araku now.

349
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:57,791
-Lice bites from my childhood.
-Oh.

350
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:02,291
By the way, they said that you went off
to Vizag because of some issues.

351
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:05,208
That's right. I tied firecrackers
to the tail of a dog

352
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:07,000
that had been barking all day.

353
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:10,166
It became a serious offense.
Then I ran away to Vizag.

354
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,750
But it really helped.
I learned many things about life.

355
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:18,083
-I need to go.
-I'll be here, bro.

356
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:20,208
-Mr. Babji has given me a job.
-Okay.

357
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:24,666
Why didn't you tell me this until now?

358
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:27,833
Unlike yours, my personal history
isn't something to be proud of.

359
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,125
Great teachers.

360
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:30,791
Can I keep my bag inside, sir?

361
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:44,958
Are you blind or what?

362
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:48,625
-You were the one who was speeding.
-Shut up! Do you want a fight?

363
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:51,625
It's okay. It's my mistake.
You carry on.

364
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:54,500
Idiot. Get lost.

365
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,666
Chandru, remove all the chairs.
They are blocking the way.

366
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,708
Okay.

367
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:10,291
They told me that the ceremony
is at 11:05.

368
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:12,958
It's at 11:05 PM, not now.

369
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:15,000
-11:05 PM?
-Yes.

370
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:17,000
-I got it wrong then.
-Where are you going?

371
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:18,708
I need to get back to my studio.

372
00:36:18,791 --> 00:36:21,750
Wait, have some tea and bananas.
Come on.

373
00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:24,125
-Okay.
-Come on.

374
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:35,125
Do you want to take a photo
with your wife, old man?

375
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:36,791
I want a photo with your wife.

376
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:39,666
Don't be so sarcastic. That's why
your cousin fell from a tree and died.

377
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,166
-You be careful then.
-Why should I be careful?

378
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:45,500
-You are the one in a tree now.
-Can't argue with an old jerk.

379
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:47,750
The bananas have arrived.
Go and gulp down a few.

380
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:51,166
Bears are roaming around the village.
Be careful.

381
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,708
-Yeah, Babji told me.
-Can you get me some bananas?

382
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:55,833
-Get some bananas here.
-Here you go.

383
00:36:55,916 --> 00:36:58,166
-I'll get some for him.
-It's okay. I just had breakfast.

384
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,625
-Have some.
-I'm good.

385
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:06,750
These bananas taste so good.

386
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:10,333
-Don't they?
-Yes, very tasty.

387
00:37:10,791 --> 00:37:13,583
-They are from Karuna's plantation.
-From where?

388
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:15,416
Karuna's plantation.

389
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:17,041
Chandru...

390
00:37:17,541 --> 00:37:21,208
You should inform me when you get
the fruits from that plantation.

391
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:23,208
They didn't want to tell you.

392
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:24,916
Keep quiet.

393
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:28,041
Karuna asked me to take care
of the plantation.

394
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:29,791
What should I tell him now?

395
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:32,416
-What? He asked you?
-Yes.

396
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:36,583
Not just the plantation, he asked me
to take care of his entire property.

397
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:39,250
No one entrusts a fool
to look after their property.

398
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:41,375
He asked me
to take care of his plantation.

399
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:45,750
How dare you call me a fool!
You steal in your own house to play cards.

400
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:49,083
-How can anyone trust you?
-Don't make me mad.

401
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,833
-I'll make you mad. What will you do?
-Stop it.

402
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:53,958
-What can you do...
-Chandru...

403
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:56,416
-We have a wedding here.
-This old guy is talking too much.

404
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,500
-Stop it.
-What will you do?

405
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:00,583
-Don't touch me.
-Cut the crap.

406
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:02,750
-I'm going to kill you, old fool.
-I dare you!

407
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:05,458
-I swear, I'll kill you.
-Don't you talk to me like that.

408
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:06,916
Stop it! Shut up.

409
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,333
Sit down.

410
00:38:09,541 --> 00:38:10,875
Shame on you.

411
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,291
We're going to have a wedding here.

412
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:16,916
Morons.

413
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,666
Shame on you!

414
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:20,875
Get away.

415
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,708
-Have you gone mad?
-I haven't gone mad.

416
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:39,291
You have gone mad.
You want to take over the plantation.

417
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:42,333
-How dare you accuse me like that!
-Yes, that's what you want.

418
00:38:42,416 --> 00:38:44,083
I'll do whatever I want.

419
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:47,500
-That's my plantation.
-Listen to yourself.

420
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:48,958
Shut up.

421
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:51,375
-How can it be yours?
-You old fart!

422
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:52,666
Stop it, guys.

423
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:54,833
-He says that is his plantation.
-You can't hit him.

424
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,000
That's my plantation.

425
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,375
Ring him up.

426
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:58,708
Call Karuna now.

427
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:01,083
Where should I keep this?

428
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:03,583
Go there and ask him.

429
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:08,416
-Sir, where should I keep this?
-Put it in the prayer room.

430
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,833
-Hit him with it.
-Keep dialing!

431
00:39:09,916 --> 00:39:11,125
I'll shove it up your ass.

432
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,791
-I don't have prepaid balance.
-So, you can't even make a call.

433
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:17,916
But you want to show the whole world
how tough you are.

434
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:19,708
Tell me the number.

435
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:33,083
Who's calling at this odd hour?

436
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:35,541
It's from India.

437
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,208
Hello, who's this?

438
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:40,166
I'm Nancharayya,
a member of the village council.

439
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,541
What's the matter, Nancharayya?

440
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:45,791
Appanna and Chandru
are having a fight.

441
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:49,250
Whom did you put in charge of
your banana plantation?

442
00:39:49,666 --> 00:39:51,000
Chandru. Why do you ask?

443
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:54,375
Let's talk about it later.
International calls are expensive.

444
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:03,041
Got it? How dare you accuse me
of trying to steal the plantation?

445
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:04,375
Come on, go about your work.

446
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,916
What's with Chandru?

447
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:08,708
Nothing.

448
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:11,833
He asked me who's taking care of
the banana plantation.

449
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:14,041
I said that it's Chandru.

450
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:18,166
What? My uncle, Appanna, has been
taking care of our properties for years.

451
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:22,916
Chandru has no job.

452
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,083
I put him in charge of our plantation
so that he can earn and prosper in life.

453
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:31,250
When you went to India alone, I knew
you'd do something foolish like this.

454
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:38,541
What does it matter now?

455
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:41,041
Get back to sleep.
Let's talk in the morning.

456
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:42,875
Sleep.

457
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:48,250
Try to sleep.

458
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:02,750
Chandru! What the hell!

459
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:05,250
Oh, God!

460
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:07,750
Why are you hitting yourself now?

461
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,333
-What do you want now?
-Absolutely nothing.

462
00:41:12,916 --> 00:41:15,041
Actually, he put me
in charge of the plantation.

463
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:17,541
I never knew about his new arrangement
with this guy.

464
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:20,791
Calm down, Appanna.
Take it easy.

465
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,583
Why do you both have to fight
over someone else's property?

466
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:29,625
It's Karuna again.

467
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,416
Nanchari...

468
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:39,041
My wife, Brinda, wants Appanna
to be in charge of the plantation.

469
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:41,083
Ask Appanna to take up the responsibility.

470
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,291
Okay.

471
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:48,333
He wants Appanna to take care of it.

472
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,125
Did you hear that, boy?

473
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:56,000
You can't fool Karuna
with your cunningness, boy.

474
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:58,583
You are such a fool, Karuna.
Why did you mention my name?

475
00:41:58,666 --> 00:41:59,833
You wanted Chandru out.

476
00:41:59,916 --> 00:42:03,166
Now if Chandru tells this to your mother,
she'll lash out at me.

477
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:06,333
She's already telling the entire village
that I boss you around.

478
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:11,666
There's nothing to worry about.

479
00:42:11,791 --> 00:42:13,208
Please, try and get some sleep.

480
00:42:13,291 --> 00:42:14,958
You strut around the entire village

481
00:42:15,041 --> 00:42:17,083
and pretend to be
a noble and generous man.

482
00:42:17,166 --> 00:42:19,500
And I come across a spiteful devil.
Right?

483
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:21,666
Come on, call them again.
Do it!

484
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:22,791
Hey, I will...

485
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:32,250
I will call them.
Calm down, don't shout.

486
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:38,458
-Did you bring the required utensils?
-Yes.

487
00:42:39,916 --> 00:42:41,333
-Get back to work.
-Okay.

488
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,791
Nanchari, leave the plantation
under Chandru's care.

489
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:49,708
By the way, I make
all the important decisions,

490
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:50,833
not my wife.

491
00:42:53,375 --> 00:42:56,541
Fickle-headed jackass. How many times
will you change your decision?

492
00:42:56,625 --> 00:42:58,291
-What did you say?
-<span style="style.default_1">You heard me.</span>

493
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,041
Can't you decide on someone?

494
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:01,875
<span style="style.default_1">Are you trying to create a rift among us?</span>

495
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:04,416
-Who the hell are you, dumbass?
-What?

496
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:08,625
Who the hell am I?
I'm the one who goes to bed with your mom.

497
00:43:08,916 --> 00:43:10,416
Didn't your mom tell you that?

498
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:12,458
Asshole.

499
00:43:13,708 --> 00:43:15,333
How dare you talk to my cousin like that?

500
00:43:15,541 --> 00:43:16,750
He's my family, you know.

501
00:43:18,416 --> 00:43:20,416
-You...
-Get lost.

502
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:46,666
Nanchari, what did you do
about our request for new bathrooms?

503
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,708
Get lost. You and your shitty bathrooms.

504
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,708
Can't you see? Get up.

505
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,708
Look at what you did.

506
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:16,083
-It's not me.
-No, it's you.

507
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:17,666
-It's him.
-Who will pay for this?

508
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,875
-Not my fault.
-Yes, it is. Look there.

509
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:21,958
-I didn't do it.
-My fruits got ruined.

510
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:24,125
-It is his fault.
-No, you did this.

511
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:28,250
You have to...

512
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:10,375
Hey... Stop!

513
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:13,416
Stop... Stop, I say.

514
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,208
Stop.

515
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,666
Wow, star fruits!

516
00:45:27,416 --> 00:45:30,000
My fruits...

517
00:45:30,083 --> 00:45:32,666
Don't take my fruit.

518
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:36,000
Stop... Give my fruits back...

519
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:38,250
Susi, get some water.

520
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:41,291
Susi?

521
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:49,500
Susi?

522
00:45:50,291 --> 00:45:51,375
Susi?

523
00:45:56,541 --> 00:45:59,791
What are you doing?
Why are you acting crazy?

524
00:45:59,875 --> 00:46:02,208
I'll slap you if you annoy me now.

525
00:46:02,291 --> 00:46:04,416
My husband is trying to beat me to death.

526
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,916
Have you gone mad or what?

527
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,750
Shut up and go away,
or you will meet your maker.

528
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:12,250
-What?
-Go away.

529
00:46:19,791 --> 00:46:23,000
-Do you want bamboo chicken?
-I have had enough of it.

530
00:46:23,416 --> 00:46:24,916
-Hello?
<span style="style.default_1">-Hello, Babji.</span>

531
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,416
Panduraju is trying to kill your sister.

532
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:30,166
-God, he's killing me.
-Haven't you left yet?

533
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:31,291
Is he hitting her?

534
00:46:32,166 --> 00:46:33,125
Why?

535
00:46:48,583 --> 00:46:49,833
Give me two tobacco packets.

536
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:53,125
Please top up my prepaid mobile balance.
It's urgent.

537
00:46:54,208 --> 00:46:56,750
-Tell me the number.
-Hey, I'm waiting.

538
00:46:58,791 --> 00:47:00,125
Hey, I've been waiting.

539
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:02,333
Serve me first and then attend to him.

540
00:47:02,416 --> 00:47:04,083
-Hey, how dare you push me?
-Hey.

541
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:05,833
-How dare you?
-What?

542
00:47:05,916 --> 00:47:08,041
Don't you talk to me like that.

543
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:10,791
I'll kick your ass, bastard...

544
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:13,208
You crazy bugger.

545
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:17,125
-I'm going to kill you.
-Don't make me smash your face.

546
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:23,083
-Hey, what's happening?
-You old piece of crap!

547
00:47:23,166 --> 00:47:26,208
-Don't make a scene, mister.
-I'll kill you, you old fool.

548
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:28,875
-Get lost.
-What do you think of me...

549
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,375
Go ahead.

550
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:36,250
I'm going to kill you, you piece of shit.

551
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:38,666
What the hell is wrong with you, man?
Let's go.

552
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:40,791
-I'll kill him.
-You just got out of jail.

553
00:47:40,875 --> 00:47:41,875
-Enough.
-I'll kill him.

554
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:44,208
-Calm down.
-Come on, get in.

555
00:47:44,541 --> 00:47:45,916
Son of a bitch.

556
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:49,208
How dare you attack my boss?

557
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:51,625
Shaggy bastard.

558
00:47:51,708 --> 00:47:53,000
What the hell!

559
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:54,416
I'll kill you all.

560
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,416
He attacked Babji.

561
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,250
-Please calm down, man.
-How dare he...

562
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,375
Please calm down.

563
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,625
Hey, Mahesh.

564
00:48:16,166 --> 00:48:17,541
Hit him back.

565
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:20,333
Get back on your feet.

566
00:49:10,791 --> 00:49:12,833
Did you crack your skull?

567
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:16,375
Boy, stop it. He lost.

568
00:50:17,208 --> 00:50:19,750
And you won.
Now, let him go.

569
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:28,375
Let's go, guys.

570
00:50:42,166 --> 00:50:43,750
Check if he suffered any serious injury.

571
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,875
You are a sissy.

572
00:50:49,958 --> 00:50:51,083
Help him.

573
00:50:51,875 --> 00:50:53,291
Move aside...

574
00:50:54,208 --> 00:50:55,291
Make way.

575
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:57,375
-I'll get his slippers.
-Hold on.

576
00:51:04,291 --> 00:51:07,041
Move... Put on your slippers, bro.

577
00:51:09,083 --> 00:51:10,500
Put on your slippers.

578
00:51:10,916 --> 00:51:13,750
Put on your slippers.
You can't walk barefoot.

579
00:51:18,083 --> 00:51:22,125
Mahesh, calm down.
Put on your slippers.

580
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,500
Mahesh...

581
00:51:29,291 --> 00:51:30,458
Put on your slippers.

582
00:51:30,541 --> 00:51:32,666
I will walk barefoot
until I pay him back in kind.

583
00:51:36,708 --> 00:51:37,708
Move away.

584
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:49,291
Take off the pants.

585
00:51:50,291 --> 00:51:51,458
Hold on.

586
00:51:57,458 --> 00:52:00,041
Careful. Sit down.

587
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,625
Let me take a look at your leg.

588
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:11,791
Easy.

589
00:52:18,041 --> 00:52:20,875
Is it paining here?
Here, right?

590
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,916
It got sprained.

591
00:52:23,416 --> 00:52:25,375
Go get some herbal oil.

592
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:31,500
There is a jar on the third shelf.
Bring it here.

593
00:52:55,583 --> 00:52:59,000
I'm sure he's a gangbanger.

594
00:53:01,083 --> 00:53:01,916
Oh, God.

595
00:53:02,625 --> 00:53:04,333
Why should we care who he is?

596
00:53:05,541 --> 00:53:08,583
My cheek has swollen up,
and I'm not able to eat.

597
00:53:20,125 --> 00:53:21,791
The pain will go away within two weeks.

598
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:23,666
Don't worry.

599
00:53:24,416 --> 00:53:26,041
Things like this keep happening at times.

600
00:53:26,708 --> 00:53:30,208
We should never get into a fight
without gauging the opponent's strength.

601
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:40,375
You have known me since I was a kid.

602
00:53:41,416 --> 00:53:43,958
Have you ever seen me getting into a fight

603
00:53:44,041 --> 00:53:46,666
with anyone in the village?

604
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:50,000
Did you at least hear me yell at anyone?

605
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:52,500
Never.

606
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,083
You will soon see what happens
when a gentle-mannered guy gets angry.

607
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:04,500
Get ready to witness
Uma Maheshwara's fury.

608
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:08,125
Mahesh, why are you uttering
such dramatic dialogues?

609
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:12,291
Nancharayya, stop drinking
and talk to him.

610
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:16,208
I have decided not to get involved
in matters that don't concern me.

611
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:20,208
It was just a few people who witnessed
the whole thing.

612
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:24,291
It's crazy of you to walk barefoot
until you avenge what happened there.

613
00:54:24,708 --> 00:54:26,708
-Listen, Mahesh...
-I'm my father's son.

614
00:54:28,416 --> 00:54:31,083
The man who's sitting there.
He's Manohar Rao.

615
00:54:31,166 --> 00:54:32,250
That's my dad.

616
00:54:44,083 --> 00:54:45,500
Are you awake, Swathi?

617
00:54:47,708 --> 00:54:48,750
Swathi?

618
00:54:50,083 --> 00:54:51,750
Dad wants you to enjoy a good life.

619
00:54:51,833 --> 00:54:53,583
I know. Please don't start it again.

620
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:55,625
Hush. Your sister is sleeping.

621
00:54:57,291 --> 00:54:58,458
I'm your mother.

622
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:01,708
You don't have to hide anything from me.

623
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:04,375
I know what you are going through.

624
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:09,083
Hug me tightly.
Cry all your pain out and forget him.

625
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:31,291
Cry all your pain out.

626
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:35,916
My mom used to say that thoughts
and memories are the heaviest burdens.

627
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:40,291
Cry them out as tears,
and your heart will feel lighter.

628
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:50,208
-Do you think he's home?
-His bike is here. He must be home.

629
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:53,750
Mahesh, please come out.

630
00:55:58,125 --> 00:56:01,791
-What is it, Dad?
-They want to talk to you about something.

631
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:09,000
What happened to your face?

632
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:11,250
-It's nothing.
-Okay.

633
00:56:12,583 --> 00:56:13,791
What's the matter?

634
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:19,291
-Why don't you tell him?
-No, Brother. You should tell him.

635
00:56:27,666 --> 00:56:30,958
I know what's going on
between you and my daughter.

636
00:56:34,333 --> 00:56:36,291
I have known you since you were a boy.

637
00:56:36,375 --> 00:56:37,750
You are a really nice guy.

638
00:56:39,541 --> 00:56:42,041
But she's got a good suitor.

639
00:56:43,958 --> 00:56:46,500
She had always wanted to marry you.

640
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:49,000
But now she is confused.

641
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:54,958
Here is the phone. She's on the line.

642
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:03,333
If you both can talk it out
and come to an understanding...

643
00:57:22,791 --> 00:57:23,875
Mahesh?

644
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:27,416
Yes.

645
00:57:33,916 --> 00:57:36,208
I'm really confused, Mahesh.

646
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:46,416
I don't know if I can ever forget you.

647
00:57:51,875 --> 00:57:53,000
But...

648
00:57:53,791 --> 00:57:56,333
But I think this is for our own good.

649
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,500
Are you breaking up with me?

650
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:05,000
I'm not saying that.

651
00:58:05,708 --> 00:58:08,208
All that I'm saying is, I'm confused.

652
00:58:09,125 --> 00:58:10,416
You are confused?

653
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:17,000
So you have many options.

654
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:27,416
Okay.

655
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,916
Don't feel guilty.

656
00:58:34,708 --> 00:58:36,416
Nothing hurts as bad as guilt does.

657
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,375
Let's go.

658
01:01:44,541 --> 01:01:45,833
Bro, I need...

659
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:49,750
Are you removing the photos?
That's better.

660
01:01:50,125 --> 01:01:53,708
It's nothing.
These photos are just for display.

661
01:01:54,541 --> 01:01:56,250
So they amount to nothing, right?

662
01:01:56,333 --> 01:01:57,416
Hey.

663
01:01:58,541 --> 01:01:59,666
Don't say that.

664
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,541
-What do you want?
-I want two passport-size photos.

665
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:03,833
Come on.

666
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:10,708
-What do you need them for?
-To open a bank account.

667
01:02:17,041 --> 01:02:18,166
Sit.

668
01:02:25,916 --> 01:02:28,541
I read a story in a magazine last night.

669
01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:31,875
The protagonist kills a man
out of vengeance and gets jailed.

670
01:02:32,541 --> 01:02:35,250
His girlfriend moves on to another man.

671
01:02:35,333 --> 01:02:38,458
His sister finds it difficult to survive
and becomes a prostitute.

672
01:02:38,625 --> 01:02:40,500
Her father becomes her pimp.

673
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,916
After a few years,
the protagonist gets out of jail.

674
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,750
And when he's begging on the streets,
a bad guy comes and stabs him.

675
01:02:48,416 --> 01:02:50,375
That's it. The end.

676
01:02:50,916 --> 01:02:54,375
I was thinking about you
while I was reading that story.

677
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,625
Do we need to seek vengeance?

678
01:03:09,291 --> 01:03:12,708
There's nothing to say.
I seek vengeance.

679
01:03:12,791 --> 01:03:15,083
Wonderful! I was just testing you.

680
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:18,041
His name is Jognath.
He works at a welding shop in Hukumpet.

681
01:03:18,125 --> 01:03:19,375
Let's go get him.

682
01:03:23,458 --> 01:03:26,625
Are you wearing a lungi?
Make sure it doesn't come off.

683
01:03:26,708 --> 01:03:29,500
He tore your pants when he attacked you.

684
01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:32,750
Let's smash him to a fine pulp.
Let's go.

685
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:48,000
Mahesh is going to thrash that guy now.

686
01:03:48,083 --> 01:03:50,791
-Is it?
-Mahesh is going to fight with that guy.

687
01:03:50,875 --> 01:03:55,000
Uncle, Mahesh is going to challenge him
to a fight.

688
01:03:55,375 --> 01:03:57,958
-Where is he going to?
-He's going to fight with that guy.

689
01:03:58,541 --> 01:04:00,625
He's going to fight with that guy.

690
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:07,625
Get me a pair of nine-inch slippers.

691
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:11,875
Give me a pair of nine-inch slippers.
Mahesh is going to fight that guy.

692
01:04:11,958 --> 01:04:13,166
Is he?

693
01:04:14,208 --> 01:04:15,166
Let's go.

694
01:04:20,333 --> 01:04:22,916
Let me join you, guys.

695
01:04:26,125 --> 01:04:27,875
Don't walk on the road.
Keep to the sides.

696
01:04:27,958 --> 01:04:29,125
Come on.

697
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:32,791
Hey, don't you understand what I'm saying?
Get off the road.

698
01:04:36,041 --> 01:04:37,125
Mahesh...

699
01:04:37,416 --> 01:04:39,333
-Mahesh...
-Mahesh is going to attack him.

700
01:04:39,416 --> 01:04:41,166
-Really?
-I don't want to get involved.

701
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:43,625
-Let me join you.
-Let's go, guys.

702
01:04:43,708 --> 01:04:46,041
Don't leave the ritual incomplete.
It's bad luck.

703
01:04:46,125 --> 01:04:47,666
Subbi... Wait.

704
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:22,208
SRI MODAMAMBA WELDING WORKS

705
01:05:26,875 --> 01:05:28,625
Uncle, beat the drums.

706
01:05:28,708 --> 01:05:30,791
Mahesh is going to kick him in the balls.

707
01:05:58,666 --> 01:06:00,375
Give me the hammer.

708
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:03,250
-What do you want?
-Is Jognath here?

709
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:05,500
He left for Dubai. He got a job there.

710
01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:29,083
PADERU,
VISAKHAPATNAM DISTRICT

711
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:36,375
Wash your hands properly
and close the tap.

712
01:06:37,916 --> 01:06:39,625
Bring us some tea, boy.

713
01:06:41,041 --> 01:06:42,875
I have only 20 rupees, master.

714
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,625
Bring a couple of samosas too.

715
01:06:44,708 --> 01:06:46,583
How is your hand now?

716
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:49,000
Excuse me.
Where can I find kun fu master Girish?

717
01:06:55,791 --> 01:06:56,625
Hello, master.

718
01:06:57,625 --> 01:06:58,541
Hi, who are you?

719
01:06:58,625 --> 01:07:02,250
My name is Korra Pongidora.
I'm from the town called G. Madugula.

720
01:07:03,916 --> 01:07:04,750
Have a seat.

721
01:07:06,791 --> 01:07:09,875
I'm here because...
I want to beat up a few guys, master.

722
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:13,708
I want to learn kun fu from you.

723
01:07:14,333 --> 01:07:17,000
It's called kung fu, not kun fu.

724
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:20,791
And such martial arts
are only for self-protection,

725
01:07:20,875 --> 01:07:22,208
not to attack people.

726
01:07:22,291 --> 01:07:24,708
I want to protect myself.
That's why I want to learn it.

727
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,000
My sister-in-law is a college student.

728
01:07:28,083 --> 01:07:31,916
Some guys were clicking pictures of her
and harassing her.

729
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:36,041
So she began to hire cabs
to get back home from college.

730
01:07:37,041 --> 01:07:40,250
A cab driver misbehaved with her.

731
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:43,625
I went to warn him,
and he knocked me down and beat me.

732
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:47,416
-Bring the samosas, boy.
-Coming.

733
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:52,458
I'm disgusted at myself
as I'm not able to help my sister-in-law.

734
01:08:07,291 --> 01:08:10,541
Let's welcome our new student, Pongidora.

735
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:18,541
Hepzibah, help Pongidora to warm up.

736
01:08:22,333 --> 01:08:24,458
Now let's do leg raises.

737
01:08:30,583 --> 01:08:32,041
Oh, God!

738
01:08:33,208 --> 01:08:35,750
-Are you hurt?
-Are you okay?

739
01:08:35,875 --> 01:08:37,500
Are you okay, mister?

740
01:08:37,583 --> 01:08:39,708
Move aside, guys.

741
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:42,916
Mahesh, get up.

742
01:08:46,791 --> 01:08:48,250
It's hurting, master.

743
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,666
Only when you are dead,
you won't feel pain.

744
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:53,875
Where there is life, there is pain.
You are not dead yet.

745
01:08:54,416 --> 01:08:55,708
Get back on your feet.

746
01:09:03,291 --> 01:09:04,666
Go back to your positions.

747
01:09:19,583 --> 01:09:20,791
Come on, one more.

748
01:09:24,541 --> 01:09:25,375
Come on, Mahesh.

749
01:09:44,208 --> 01:09:47,458
Mahesh, give me a lift.
I have to attend a wedding.

750
01:09:47,791 --> 01:09:48,791
Hop on.

751
01:09:50,791 --> 01:09:51,875
Let's go.

752
01:09:55,416 --> 01:09:56,458
Whose wedding?

753
01:09:56,541 --> 01:09:58,750
Yesupadam's daughter, Swathi,
is getting married.

754
01:10:09,625 --> 01:10:12,166
Marriage is a sacred bond.

755
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:15,666
God sanctioned this union and blessed it.

756
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:21,250
Michael, do you wholeheartedly accept
Swathi as your wife?

757
01:10:21,333 --> 01:10:22,541
I do.

758
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:28,791
Swathi, do you wholeheartedly accept
Michael as your husband?

759
01:10:37,291 --> 01:10:38,583
I do.

760
01:10:49,125 --> 01:10:50,916
Do you get Indian food in America?

761
01:10:51,083 --> 01:10:53,000
Yeah, we even get biryani in Wall Street.

762
01:10:53,375 --> 01:10:54,708
What's Wall Street?

763
01:10:54,791 --> 01:10:56,666
It's a small street in New York.

764
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:01,333
Let me pass, please.

765
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:21,666
Give way. Move aside, please.

766
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:24,250
-Make way, please.
-It's okay, Uncle.

767
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:25,958
You don't have to do this.

768
01:11:26,166 --> 01:11:28,416
Sorry. Let me wash hands.

769
01:11:38,375 --> 01:11:39,875
-Come, let's go.
-I'm coming.

770
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,791
Where are you going, son?

771
01:12:29,291 --> 01:12:30,458
To the shop, Dad.

772
01:12:30,541 --> 01:12:32,916
You can go once the rain stops.
Sit down.

773
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:45,416
Don't call it a shop. It's a studio.

774
01:12:55,166 --> 01:12:56,166
Mahesh...

775
01:12:57,208 --> 01:13:00,916
Two people unite.
Two souls get separated.

776
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,375
How long can you blame the soul
that can't even be seen?

777
01:13:05,458 --> 01:13:08,541
If you don't let go of those
who wanted to leave,

778
01:13:08,708 --> 01:13:10,541
their presence doesn't bring you any joy.

779
01:13:59,125 --> 01:13:59,958
Mithila.

780
01:14:03,666 --> 01:14:05,041
I'll pay you later.

781
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:16,416
-What are you doing here?
-I'm going to my class.

782
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,250
I'm running an errand for your dad.

783
01:14:18,333 --> 01:14:20,125
What happened to your braces?

784
01:14:20,208 --> 01:14:23,500
-They are in my bag. You want them?
-You have crooked teeth. You need them.

785
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:28,333
-Want to have a drink?
-No, I'm getting late. I need to go.

786
01:14:28,416 --> 01:14:29,666
Me too.

787
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:30,916
Bye. See you.

788
01:14:37,916 --> 01:14:40,333
-How's the movie?
-It's okay. Get in.

789
01:14:40,625 --> 01:14:42,291
Sounds like a flop to me.

790
01:14:43,708 --> 01:14:45,958
Let me pass, please.

791
01:14:50,666 --> 01:14:52,416
Don't stare at me like that.

792
01:14:56,708 --> 01:14:58,000
You have got a nice classroom.

793
01:14:58,875 --> 01:15:01,000
-Don't tell my dad.
-You too.

794
01:15:07,583 --> 01:15:09,666
Why do you want to see Mahesh Babu's film?

795
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:12,500
I want to slam the film on Twitter
if it doesn't impress me.

796
01:15:12,583 --> 01:15:14,583
You are on Twitter?

797
01:15:15,791 --> 01:15:18,083
I roast his films through fan pages.

798
01:15:19,083 --> 01:15:21,250
I'll do the same to your favorite actor.

799
01:15:21,875 --> 01:15:24,583
You are not even on Twitter.
Watch the movie.

800
01:15:30,875 --> 01:15:33,416
-Bring tea.
-"A ghastly incident took place in Vizag."

801
01:15:33,583 --> 01:15:38,000
"A father committed suicide
as his daughter eloped with her lover."

802
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,875
Hey, what are you staring at?

803
01:15:52,583 --> 01:15:55,541
-Checking if he's wearing...
-Checking if he's wearing an underwear?

804
01:15:55,625 --> 01:15:57,750
No. Slippers.

805
01:15:57,833 --> 01:16:00,541
I'll beat the hell out of you.
Get lost.

806
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:04,125
Get me some snacks.

807
01:16:12,083 --> 01:16:13,791
-Don't tell your dad.
-You too.

808
01:16:25,958 --> 01:16:27,875
<span style="style.default_1">Most of them are Telugus.</span>

809
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:31,375
<span style="style.default_1">They are struggling to survive abroad,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but they are not able to return home.</span>

810
01:16:31,458 --> 01:16:36,333
<span style="style.default_1">As many companies that employ Indians</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in Saudi Arabia have shut down,</span>

811
01:16:36,416 --> 01:16:40,708
<span style="style.default_1">thousands of Indian immigrant workers like</span>
<span style="style.default_1">drivers, welders and contract workers</span>

812
01:16:40,791 --> 01:16:41,708
<span style="style.default_1">have lost their jobs.</span>

813
01:16:41,791 --> 01:16:46,750
<span style="style.default_1">They are requesting the Indian embassy</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to help them return home.</span>

814
01:17:06,541 --> 01:17:07,916
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

815
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,291
-Where is Jognath's house?
-Jogi's house?

816
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:11,291
Yeah.

817
01:17:11,375 --> 01:17:14,583
Go through that coffee plantation
and take left.

818
01:17:17,458 --> 01:17:20,000
-Can I have a lemonade?
-We don't have it.

819
01:17:20,125 --> 01:17:21,875
-Do you want a soft drink?
-Sure.

820
01:17:26,083 --> 01:17:27,166
Here you go.

821
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:31,208
-Where are you from?
-Araku.

822
01:17:31,833 --> 01:17:32,916
Araku?

823
01:17:34,125 --> 01:17:38,083
Do you know the guy who's walking barefoot
after getting thrashed by Jognath?

824
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:42,416
I don't know.

825
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
-Did you see him beat that guy?
-No.

826
01:17:45,083 --> 01:17:47,875
I heard people talk about it at length.

827
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:51,583
-How much?
-Twenty rupees.

828
01:17:53,333 --> 01:17:54,875
-Take the bottle.
-Keep it.

829
01:17:56,458 --> 01:17:58,125
-Bro.
-Yes?

830
01:17:58,208 --> 01:18:01,291
Do people from your village walk barefoot
to show solidarity with that guy?

831
01:18:01,375 --> 01:18:03,000
It's part of my religious penance.

832
01:18:03,541 --> 01:18:05,625
-What religious penance is that?
-What a nosy guy!

833
01:18:06,375 --> 01:18:08,083
He opened the bottle.

834
01:18:35,541 --> 01:18:36,458
Who's that?

835
01:18:39,166 --> 01:18:40,166
Is this Jognath's house?

836
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:42,541
Yes. Who are you?

837
01:18:44,416 --> 01:18:45,375
I'm his friend.

838
01:18:45,666 --> 01:18:47,916
Have a seat. I'll be back in a minute.

839
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:35,708
What brings you here?

840
01:19:37,125 --> 01:19:39,958
I saw in the news
that they are sending our people back

841
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:41,708
because of some problem in the Gulf.

842
01:19:41,791 --> 01:19:44,666
How is our Jogi doing there?

843
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:46,750
-Oh, God!
-Don't worry.

844
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:51,375
I think he will be okay.
They can't send everyone back.

845
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:53,833
He used to fight with others all the time
when he was here.

846
01:19:53,916 --> 01:19:56,041
We are at peace after he left.

847
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,583
I called him last night.
He said nothing about the situation there.

848
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:08,041
-Okay. I need to go.
-Wait a minute.

849
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:10,250
-I made tea for you.
-No, thanks. I need to...

850
01:20:10,333 --> 01:20:12,458
Please wait. I'll get it.

851
01:20:43,708 --> 01:20:45,666
Where are you from?
I never saw you before.

852
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:47,833
Mom!

853
01:20:47,916 --> 01:20:50,791
God, she's here.
I'll be back.

854
01:20:56,375 --> 01:20:58,125
-Mom!
-What is it?

855
01:20:58,208 --> 01:20:59,458
Is there nothing to eat?

856
01:20:59,541 --> 01:21:02,500
I made your favorite snacks.
I served them to your brother's friend.

857
01:21:02,583 --> 01:21:05,291
You know that I'll be hungry
after returning from college.

858
01:21:05,375 --> 01:21:07,208
I know. Wait, I'll prepare them again.

859
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,875
You should've just served tea.
You didn't have to feed him.

860
01:21:09,958 --> 01:21:12,125
Hush! He might hear you.

861
01:21:12,208 --> 01:21:13,750
I'm so hungry.

862
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:16,208
Ma'am, I'm leaving.

863
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:21,958
It seems you are the hungriest person
in the whole world.

864
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:25,083
You need to learn to behave
like a grown-up.

865
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:28,166
-Show some respect to guests.
-Hey, oldie.

866
01:21:29,333 --> 01:21:31,916
No one will visit our house
if you act like that.

867
01:21:32,708 --> 01:21:36,666
Damn! I thought I could live in peace
as your brother left for Dubai.

868
01:21:37,083 --> 01:21:38,500
But you are driving me crazy.

869
01:21:38,875 --> 01:21:42,166
I'm not able to deal with you.
Will you ever listen to me?

870
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:49,833
Jyothi, you know what?

871
01:21:51,041 --> 01:21:54,250
Kalpana is sending her photo
to a magazine competition.

872
01:21:55,583 --> 01:21:58,541
I told her about the competition.
I have already sent mine.

873
01:21:58,666 --> 01:21:59,750
Really?

874
01:22:02,416 --> 01:22:03,583
Mithila...

875
01:22:04,041 --> 01:22:05,166
Please move aside.

876
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,125
Is there any photo studio in Araku?

877
01:22:07,208 --> 01:22:09,041
Yeah, Mahesh's studio.
Why do you ask?

878
01:22:09,125 --> 01:22:12,083
I want to take some photos of mine
for a magazine cover.

879
01:22:12,166 --> 01:22:13,458
Oh.

880
01:22:13,541 --> 01:22:17,000
You are all over me, girl.
Why don't you sit on my lap instead?

881
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:20,541
Thank you, lady.

882
01:23:07,666 --> 01:23:10,250
-How can I help you?
-I want to take some photos of mine.

883
01:23:10,333 --> 01:23:11,958
-Please come in.
-Mahesh, are you coming?

884
01:23:12,041 --> 01:23:14,333
-What?
-Let's have some fresh snacks.

885
01:23:14,416 --> 01:23:15,916
I have a customer.
I'll join you later.

886
01:23:16,541 --> 01:23:18,083
You are Jyothi, right?

887
01:23:19,625 --> 01:23:21,125
Yes. How do you know?

888
01:23:21,208 --> 01:23:23,250
Mithila keeps talking about you.

889
01:23:23,333 --> 01:23:24,750
How is she related to you?

890
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:26,291
She's is his sister.

891
01:23:26,416 --> 01:23:28,583
Mr. Babji is kidding.

892
01:23:28,666 --> 01:23:31,500
Mithila is his daughter.
I'm just a friend of hers.

893
01:23:31,791 --> 01:23:34,625
-Are you Suhas?
-Yeah. Korra Suhas.

894
01:23:34,708 --> 01:23:37,333
Mithila has told me about you.
NTR is your favorite movie star, right?

895
01:23:37,416 --> 01:23:38,833
I like NTR too.

896
01:23:40,166 --> 01:23:43,083
Mahesh is waiting for you.
Nice to meet you. Let's meet again.

897
01:23:43,166 --> 01:23:44,375
Okay, bye.

898
01:23:49,666 --> 01:23:51,000
Can we have the slippers on?

899
01:23:51,916 --> 01:23:53,125
Can we have the slippers on?

900
01:23:55,041 --> 01:23:56,791
I don't wear them as my foot is injured.

901
01:23:56,875 --> 01:23:59,583
No, I'm asking if I can come in
wearing slippers.

902
01:24:00,583 --> 01:24:02,750
Oh! It's okay, come in.

903
01:24:07,416 --> 01:24:09,416
Why do you have Swathi's photos here?

904
01:24:12,041 --> 01:24:13,666
They are just for display.

905
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:15,458
Come in.

906
01:24:23,791 --> 01:24:25,541
I can click the photos when you are ready.

907
01:24:32,458 --> 01:24:33,666
Please sit.

908
01:24:37,125 --> 01:24:38,250
There.

909
01:24:43,666 --> 01:24:44,875
I don't want a passport-size photo.

910
01:24:45,916 --> 01:24:47,750
I want to send the photo
to a magazine competition.

911
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:50,041
Come here, please.

912
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:56,333
These poses look good, right?

913
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,458
Okay. Why didn't you say that first?

914
01:25:01,958 --> 01:25:03,583
Need to adjust the lighting.

915
01:25:26,666 --> 01:25:27,916
Can you show it again?

916
01:25:55,958 --> 01:25:57,250
Look here.

917
01:26:00,375 --> 01:26:03,000
Can you please stand?
The background will look good.

918
01:26:13,041 --> 01:26:14,458
A little more to the left.

919
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:21,333
Can you pull your back?
It will look good.

920
01:26:35,166 --> 01:26:36,416
Chin up, a little.

921
01:26:37,541 --> 01:26:38,625
A little. Okay.

922
01:26:44,291 --> 01:26:47,541
Reducing the opacity, adding dodge effect,
and increasing the sharpness...

923
01:26:47,833 --> 01:26:49,291
The picture will look great.

924
01:26:49,375 --> 01:26:50,625
Let's make it a little fairer.

925
01:26:55,875 --> 01:26:57,000
In what size do you want the copy?

926
01:26:58,666 --> 01:27:00,000
Look at that picture.

927
01:27:00,666 --> 01:27:02,416
Do you even know photography?

928
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,291
Amateurs can click far better photos.
You know that?

929
01:27:08,916 --> 01:27:11,583
If you don't know how to take nice photos,
you should have told me.

930
01:27:13,541 --> 01:27:14,541
Hey...

931
01:27:15,125 --> 01:27:17,500
Hey, lady. Hold on.

932
01:27:32,708 --> 01:27:35,416
I'm a member of
Vishaka Photographers Association.

933
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,250
And she said that I can't click photos.

934
01:27:39,833 --> 01:27:42,791
Maybe those photos came out bad.

935
01:27:42,875 --> 01:27:44,125
Those photos looked good.

936
01:27:49,875 --> 01:27:51,333
<span style="style.default_1">This guy is going crazy.</span>

937
01:27:59,791 --> 01:28:03,375
She doesn't know about photography.
Don't take her seriously.

938
01:28:05,583 --> 01:28:08,666
I reduced the opacity
and tried to balance the colors.

939
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:10,416
I increased the sharpness too.

940
01:28:11,458 --> 01:28:15,583
I clicked exactly the way she wanted it.
Don't know why she didn't like it.

941
01:32:30,416 --> 01:32:32,583
"If you kill, you'll get killed too."

942
01:33:38,250 --> 01:33:39,958
He got his neck sprained.

943
01:33:40,041 --> 01:33:41,625
For the treatment that costs 50 bucks,

944
01:33:41,708 --> 01:33:44,333
the corporate hospital
billed the guy 50 thousand.

945
01:33:44,416 --> 01:33:46,875
He came to us as he can't afford that.
Take a look.

946
01:33:47,291 --> 01:33:50,666
He'll be here tomorrow. Ask him
to apply this oil three times a day.

947
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:51,916
Give me the next X-ray.

948
01:33:52,541 --> 01:33:53,958
-Babji.
-Yes.

949
01:33:54,416 --> 01:33:56,125
Am I a bad photographer?

950
01:33:56,250 --> 01:33:59,750
I have no idea about photography.

951
01:33:59,833 --> 01:34:00,833
So, I can't say.

952
01:34:03,333 --> 01:34:05,666
-Not this. The other one.
-Okay, bye.

953
01:34:08,208 --> 01:34:10,041
Do we have any of these bandages left?

954
01:34:10,125 --> 01:34:11,875
-Do we need to order them?
-Yes.

955
01:34:13,166 --> 01:34:14,250
Okay.

956
01:34:25,791 --> 01:34:26,791
Dad!

957
01:34:29,083 --> 01:34:30,416
Dad, come, let's go.

958
01:34:35,541 --> 01:34:36,708
Dad?

959
01:36:33,166 --> 01:36:35,000
Why are you trying to remove it?

960
01:36:35,625 --> 01:36:38,458
I want to add color to the photo
and keep some flowers around it.

961
01:36:38,541 --> 01:36:40,916
I'll break your hands
if you ever touch that photo again.

962
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:20,500
Mahesh, you have the emotion
to sustain your thirst for revenge.

963
01:37:20,583 --> 01:37:22,875
You're taking kung fu lessons
to improve your fighting skills.

964
01:37:22,958 --> 01:37:26,291
You have the skills to be a photographer.
But something is missing.

965
01:37:39,250 --> 01:37:40,583
-Dad.
-Yes.

966
01:37:40,666 --> 01:37:43,000
Teach me how to capture that emotion, Dad.

967
01:37:45,291 --> 01:37:48,541
Mahesh, you can't learn an art
by taking lessons.

968
01:37:48,625 --> 01:37:50,333
You have to live for it.

969
01:37:51,208 --> 01:37:53,875
<span style="style.default_1">Remember this.</span>

970
01:37:54,666 --> 01:37:58,916
<span style="style.default_1">Emotions are not the movement of muscles</span>
<span style="style.default_1">that you see on one's face.</span>

971
01:37:59,541 --> 01:38:02,000
<span style="style.default_1">It's a chemical reaction</span>
<span style="style.default_1">that has to happen inside us.</span>

972
01:38:02,333 --> 01:38:05,333
<span style="style.default_1">The audience should react</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to the acts of an actor.</span>

973
01:38:05,875 --> 01:38:07,666
<span style="style.default_1">It's the same with photography.</span>

974
01:38:08,958 --> 01:38:10,750
<span style="style.default_1">That emotion should develop inside you.</span>

975
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:13,500
<span style="style.default_1">Not in the things you see.</span>

976
01:38:13,958 --> 01:38:16,833
<span style="style.default_1">You need to feel the emotion that</span>
<span style="style.default_1">you want to convey through your photos.</span>

977
01:39:18,958 --> 01:39:21,333
Here. Look here...

978
01:39:22,208 --> 01:39:25,375
Look here, baby. Here...

979
01:39:31,083 --> 01:39:33,541
Come on, look here...

980
01:39:34,041 --> 01:39:35,916
Yeah, that's it.

981
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,875
Look here...

982
01:39:46,125 --> 01:39:48,458
Mustard flowers. Excellent.

983
01:39:48,625 --> 01:39:50,666
How do you get these ideas, bro?

984
01:39:51,333 --> 01:39:54,125
When it comes to these things,
I have always been ingenious.

985
01:39:54,208 --> 01:39:57,541
-What does that mean?
-I mean, I'm a creative person.

986
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,041
What happened?

987
01:39:59,583 --> 01:40:01,458
Sit down, bro.

988
01:40:02,458 --> 01:40:03,916
Let me take a look at it.

989
01:40:08,541 --> 01:40:11,333
You're walking among bushes without shoes.
Is this your creativity?

990
01:40:11,708 --> 01:40:13,708
-See, it's bleeding.
-Shut up.

991
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:15,208
Let's go.

992
01:40:15,291 --> 01:40:18,500
Only God knows when that guy will return
and when you'll have your revenge.

993
01:40:18,583 --> 01:40:22,250
Thank God you chose
to keep your clothes on.

994
01:42:22,916 --> 01:42:27,875
POST OFFICE, ARAKU COLONY

995
01:43:16,750 --> 01:43:17,958
Mahesh...

996
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:22,458
Dad, reduce the volume.

997
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:24,666
Mahesh...

998
01:43:26,166 --> 01:43:27,291
Mahesh...

999
01:43:29,208 --> 01:43:30,875
Mr. Uma Maheshwara Rao.

1000
01:43:34,541 --> 01:43:35,708
Mahesh...

1001
01:43:37,291 --> 01:43:38,416
Mahesh...

1002
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:45,166
Mr. Uma Maheshwara Rao.

1003
01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:48,125
Mahesh...

1004
01:44:01,125 --> 01:44:03,208
Oh, God! What happened?

1005
01:44:04,083 --> 01:44:05,291
Let me take a look.

1006
01:44:05,875 --> 01:44:06,916
-Let me...
-It's okay.

1007
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Why did you jump like a startled hare?

1008
01:44:09,375 --> 01:44:10,666
Wait, don't move.

1009
01:44:31,625 --> 01:44:33,666
It's not right to click my pictures
without asking me.

1010
01:44:34,375 --> 01:44:36,208
So, this is your punishment.

1011
01:44:37,333 --> 01:44:39,291
Since your intentions are not bad,

1012
01:44:39,833 --> 01:44:41,708
I forgive you and remove this splinter.

1013
01:44:43,250 --> 01:44:45,958
You wrongly sent the photo to a magazine
called Swathi.

1014
01:44:48,125 --> 01:44:50,333
But still they published the photo
on the cover.

1015
01:44:51,125 --> 01:44:53,083
So they must have liked it.

1016
01:44:55,958 --> 01:44:57,791
I'm not saying this because it's my photo.

1017
01:44:57,875 --> 01:44:59,041
The photo looks so beautiful.

1018
01:45:01,291 --> 01:45:02,458
Thank you.

1019
01:45:02,750 --> 01:45:05,458
You criticized my work that day.

1020
01:45:05,833 --> 01:45:08,333
No one had ever commented so harshly
on my photography before.

1021
01:45:08,416 --> 01:45:10,666
Now, I can tell you.
You are amazing.

1022
01:45:11,583 --> 01:45:12,875
Thanks.

1023
01:45:21,083 --> 01:45:22,208
Sorry.

1024
01:45:27,583 --> 01:45:30,666
Dad, I clicked this photo
on the magazine cover.

1025
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,708
SWATHI

1026
01:46:39,458 --> 01:46:41,875
No, Dad. It's inspiration.

1027
01:48:14,250 --> 01:48:16,291
-Did you notice something?
-Notice what?

1028
01:48:16,708 --> 01:48:20,541
That cute guy in the Komali Studio
has been eyeing me for many days.

1029
01:48:20,833 --> 01:48:24,125
What nonsense!
Maybe you should get your eyes checked.

1030
01:48:24,708 --> 01:48:26,750
-He's eyeing me.
-I see.

1031
01:49:43,333 --> 01:49:45,208
-Things are getting out of hand.
-What happened?

1032
01:49:45,541 --> 01:49:47,333
-Jyothi went to Mahesh's house.
-Is it?

1033
01:49:47,416 --> 01:49:49,625
Yes. She even removed a splinter.

1034
01:49:49,708 --> 01:49:51,958
-From his leg?
-No, I removed a thorn from his leg.

1035
01:49:52,041 --> 01:49:55,083
She removed the splinter from his hand,
and he's smitten with her.

1036
01:49:56,583 --> 01:49:58,166
What's she like?
Will she cheat him?

1037
01:49:58,250 --> 01:50:00,041
Not at all.
Why are you worried about it?

1038
01:50:00,125 --> 01:50:02,166
Of course, I will be.
She won't cheat, right?

1039
01:50:02,250 --> 01:50:03,583
No! She's not like that.

1040
01:50:03,791 --> 01:50:05,541
This time we need to be careful.

1041
01:50:06,125 --> 01:50:09,000
Mahesh is an innocent guy.
He thinks everyone is good at heart.

1042
01:50:40,333 --> 01:50:42,375
-Who's this?
-<span style="style.default_1">It's Jyothi.</span>

1043
01:50:45,333 --> 01:50:47,166
Yeah, tell me.

1044
01:50:47,833 --> 01:50:49,041
I think...

1045
01:50:50,208 --> 01:50:54,458
I have a feeling that we are going
to fall in love very soon.

1046
01:50:55,083 --> 01:50:58,833
<span style="style.default_1">So before that happens, I want</span>
<span style="style.default_1">some clarity regarding a few things.</span>

1047
01:50:58,916 --> 01:51:01,166
It's better to be clear in the beginning
rather than later.

1048
01:51:02,291 --> 01:51:03,375
Go on.

1049
01:51:03,458 --> 01:51:07,500
Firstly, Mithila told me about Swathi.

1050
01:51:07,833 --> 01:51:10,000
Her mother and my mother are cousins.

1051
01:51:10,083 --> 01:51:11,791
<span style="style.default_1">I know very well about her.</span>

1052
01:51:11,875 --> 01:51:15,125
<span style="style.default_1">When she was in school, she was told</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to collect money for tsunami relief.</span>

1053
01:51:15,208 --> 01:51:18,750
<span style="style.default_1">She and her friends used that money</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to eat chicken noodles.</span>

1054
01:51:20,416 --> 01:51:23,291
Let's not talk about all that.
It's irrelevant to us.

1055
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:26,250
In a way, you are lucky that she left you.

1056
01:51:30,250 --> 01:51:31,791
Secondly...

1057
01:51:33,708 --> 01:51:36,125
I was in a relationship, too.

1058
01:51:36,708 --> 01:51:40,333
I won't like it if you question me
about my past whenever we fight.

1059
01:51:42,208 --> 01:51:45,250
-Who was it?
-I just told you not to question me.

1060
01:51:46,416 --> 01:51:50,625
<span style="style.default_1">If you want to know more about it,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I'll tell you later.</span>

1061
01:51:51,333 --> 01:51:52,375
Thirdly...

1062
01:51:52,875 --> 01:51:54,708
You had a fight with Jognath.

1063
01:51:54,958 --> 01:51:57,166
I'm his younger sister, Jyothi.

1064
01:51:58,458 --> 01:52:00,500
<span style="style.default_1">Love me only if you have</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the courage to do so.</span>

1065
01:52:01,083 --> 01:52:02,208
Otherwise...

1066
01:52:02,833 --> 01:52:04,458
We can just leave it here and now.

1067
01:52:05,166 --> 01:52:07,583
<span style="style.default_1">Think about it and tell me your decision.</span>

1068
01:52:08,166 --> 01:52:11,000
I'm waiting at the bus stop
near your studio.

1069
01:53:05,958 --> 01:53:07,583
I'll take them down
if you don't like them.

1070
01:53:10,250 --> 01:53:13,166
Why didn't my photos come out
so well the first time?

1071
01:53:14,666 --> 01:53:16,166
Now I can click great pictures of you.

1072
01:54:31,666 --> 01:54:33,875
-Yes, Suhas? What is it?
-Bro...

1073
01:54:33,958 --> 01:54:36,375
There were two other crooks
with Jognath that day.

1074
01:54:36,458 --> 01:54:37,375
They are here.

1075
01:54:37,458 --> 01:54:41,000
<span style="style.default_1">Come here and thrash them.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Then you can wear slippers again.</span>

1076
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:43,041
I told you before.

1077
01:54:44,500 --> 01:54:45,916
My fight is with Jognath.

1078
01:54:46,166 --> 01:54:48,625
Had I wanted to beat his friends,
I would have done it long ago.

1079
01:54:50,208 --> 01:54:51,083
Let's wait for him.

1080
01:54:51,791 --> 01:54:53,833
What an idiot!

1081
01:54:55,833 --> 01:54:57,250
Who is this guy?

1082
01:55:10,541 --> 01:55:12,541
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

1083
01:55:12,625 --> 01:55:13,958
-Tell me who you are.
-Who are you?

1084
01:55:14,041 --> 01:55:16,000
I'm Korra Suhas...
Don't do it, you crazy!

1085
01:55:20,041 --> 01:55:23,291
<span style="style.default_1">What is the nature of life?</span>

1086
01:55:23,791 --> 01:55:28,583
<span style="style.default_1">Where is this life headed?</span>

1087
01:55:30,791 --> 01:55:34,625
<span style="style.default_1">What is the nature of life?</span>

1088
01:55:35,916 --> 01:55:37,041
Mr. Babji...

1089
01:55:38,041 --> 01:55:40,333
Someone thrashed Jognath's friends.

1090
01:55:40,583 --> 01:55:43,583
Their bones are broken.
God does exist.

1091
01:55:44,416 --> 01:55:46,083
There is no God!

1092
01:55:46,541 --> 01:55:49,250
If He existed, he wouldn't have created
disloyal dogs like you.

1093
01:55:49,333 --> 01:55:50,500
What are you saying?

1094
01:55:50,833 --> 01:55:51,916
Get up.

1095
01:55:52,791 --> 01:55:53,625
What happened, sir?

1096
01:55:53,708 --> 01:55:57,041
What were you and Mithila
doing at the theater yesterday?

1097
01:55:57,958 --> 01:55:59,458
-We went to the movies.
-Hey!

1098
01:55:59,708 --> 01:56:01,750
Why did you go see a movie
with my daughter?

1099
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:06,500
-If you come back, I'll gouge your eyes...
-Stop it.

1100
01:56:08,375 --> 01:56:10,916
Don't talk about it with Mithila.
Don't question her.

1101
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,416
She might lose her respect for you.

1102
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:17,958
I quit. I resign.

1103
01:56:18,041 --> 01:56:20,875
Parents of a girl foolishly think
that every boy is a rogue.

1104
01:56:20,958 --> 01:56:24,125
It'd help this society if they learned
to trust their daughters instead.

1105
01:56:24,208 --> 01:56:27,625
You doubted your daughter's virtue.
You should be ashamed.

1106
01:56:27,708 --> 01:56:29,791
I never thought that you'd stoop so low.

1107
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,083
You jump to conclusions the minute
a girl talks with a boy.

1108
01:56:36,541 --> 01:56:39,375
You might think of me as a rogue.
But Mithila...

1109
01:56:40,083 --> 01:56:41,416
She's so pure.

1110
01:56:42,083 --> 01:56:44,083
She considers me her brother.

1111
01:56:53,333 --> 01:56:54,583
With such filth in your mind,

1112
01:56:54,666 --> 01:56:57,750
none of those Gods on your wall
and your prayers can help you.

1113
01:56:58,958 --> 01:57:00,583
Suhas...

1114
01:57:01,583 --> 01:57:04,833
The last guy who worked here
misbehaved with my daughter.

1115
01:57:05,250 --> 01:57:07,000
So I was suspicious about you.

1116
01:57:20,791 --> 01:57:24,416
GURUJI'S TRADITIONAL BONE SETTING

1117
01:57:47,041 --> 01:57:50,083
<span style="style.default_1">Collect the ticket from the office.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Your flight is at seven o'clock.</span>

1118
01:57:51,208 --> 01:57:53,083
<span style="style.default_1">You don't need to inform us</span>
<span style="style.default_1">when you reach home.</span>

1119
01:58:13,666 --> 01:58:15,125
<span style="style.default_1">Hello, Brother.</span>

1120
01:58:15,208 --> 01:58:17,208
We have admitted grandma
to the hospital again.

1121
01:58:18,333 --> 01:58:19,708
<span style="style.default_1">She is in the ICU.</span>

1122
01:58:21,208 --> 01:58:22,833
They say that she might not make it.

1123
01:58:23,416 --> 01:58:25,375
<span style="style.default_1">I don't know if you can get a leave.</span>

1124
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,958
<span style="style.default_1">Uncle David Raju</span>
<span style="style.default_1">is taking care of everything here.</span>

1125
01:58:28,625 --> 01:58:31,291
If anything happens,
I'll let you know.

1126
01:59:04,041 --> 01:59:06,416
Are you still continuing
with your penance?

1127
01:59:10,125 --> 01:59:11,458
Tomorrow is the last day.

1128
01:59:11,541 --> 01:59:13,583
Are you going on a pilgrimage?
Where to?

1129
01:59:15,250 --> 01:59:17,041
-To your village.
-Our village?

1130
01:59:17,541 --> 01:59:19,208
Which temple will you visit
in our village?

1131
01:59:20,125 --> 01:59:22,041
Where do you go to apply
that sacred ash on your face?

1132
01:59:22,291 --> 01:59:25,000
I don't go to temples.
My wife smears it on my face.

1133
01:59:34,833 --> 01:59:35,833
Come here.

1134
01:59:40,125 --> 01:59:41,083
My brother is back.

1135
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:43,625
But not because my grandma died.

1136
01:59:44,208 --> 01:59:47,250
He attacked his supervisor,
and they fired him.

1137
01:59:52,208 --> 01:59:53,375
Are you scared?

1138
01:59:57,500 --> 01:59:58,541
I know kung fu.

1139
01:59:58,625 --> 02:00:00,625
Of course, I have seen you
getting your ass kicked.

1140
02:00:01,208 --> 02:00:02,208
That's just practice.

1141
02:00:02,291 --> 02:00:04,791
It's not funny. My brother is crazy.

1142
02:00:05,333 --> 02:00:06,666
You might get hurt.

1143
02:00:07,375 --> 02:00:10,500
Once we get married,
you can always hit him back.

1144
02:00:10,583 --> 02:00:11,666
No one can mock you.

1145
02:00:14,083 --> 02:00:15,583
Careful, Brother.

1146
02:00:20,833 --> 02:00:23,083
It's okay. You guys can keep talking.

1147
02:00:23,791 --> 02:00:27,208
-You can speak your heart out.
-Go on.

1148
02:00:27,583 --> 02:00:31,041
-Look at him, Brother.
-Yeah.

1149
02:00:31,125 --> 02:00:34,750
-It seems he's after this girl now.
-Thank God my daughter is not here.

1150
02:00:34,833 --> 02:00:35,875
Yes.

1151
02:00:36,500 --> 02:00:39,500
I beg you, Mahesh.
Don't create a scene here.

1152
02:00:42,791 --> 02:00:45,125
Mahesh, are you listening to me?

1153
02:00:53,875 --> 02:00:54,875
What the hell!

1154
02:01:19,250 --> 02:01:20,333
Mahesh.

1155
02:01:21,125 --> 02:01:24,958
Those who never tasted pain,
love to inflict it on others.

1156
02:01:26,125 --> 02:01:29,291
Those who tasted pain,
hesitate to raise a hand against others.

1157
02:01:32,666 --> 02:01:34,458
It's time for him to taste pain.

1158
02:01:56,833 --> 02:01:57,833
Babji...

1159
02:01:58,708 --> 02:01:59,791
Are you free tomorrow?

1160
02:02:19,125 --> 02:02:21,583
There... There he is.

1161
02:02:53,291 --> 02:02:54,500
Jognath.

1162
02:02:56,250 --> 02:02:57,583
My name is Uma Maheshwara Rao.

1163
02:02:58,083 --> 02:03:00,291
Do you remember attacking me in Araku?

1164
02:03:02,791 --> 02:03:06,125
I took a vow that I'd walk barefoot
until I pay you back in kind.

1165
02:03:10,416 --> 02:03:11,958
I hope you are healthy and strong.

1166
02:03:23,291 --> 02:03:24,250
Hey...

1167
02:03:25,208 --> 02:03:26,333
You have lost your mind, Mahesh.

1168
02:03:27,583 --> 02:03:28,625
Come on.

1169
02:03:30,625 --> 02:03:31,666
Mom...

1170
02:03:31,875 --> 02:03:34,500
Men are so stupid, right?

1171
02:03:34,583 --> 02:03:38,166
You are right.
And that stupidity knows no bounds.

1172
02:03:38,833 --> 02:03:40,250
Anyway, where is this coming from?

1173
02:04:34,416 --> 02:04:35,625
Get him!

1174
02:06:59,041 --> 02:07:01,583
Mahesh, come on!

1175
02:07:16,208 --> 02:07:19,083
Mahesh, get up!

1176
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:23,583
<span style="style.default_1">Only when you are dead,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">you won't feel pain.</span>

1177
02:07:23,875 --> 02:07:26,708
<span style="style.default_1">Where there is life, there is pain.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You are not dead yet.</span>

1178
02:07:27,041 --> 02:07:28,666
<span style="style.default_1">Get back on your feet.</span>

1179
02:08:52,791 --> 02:08:54,041
Thrash him, Mahesh.

1180
02:09:40,750 --> 02:09:42,000
Mahesh...

1181
02:10:18,666 --> 02:10:21,000
Hey, we should have called
the entire village.

1182
02:10:21,083 --> 02:10:22,291
Why did you call only me?

1183
02:10:22,375 --> 02:10:23,833
Everyone would have seen it.

1184
02:10:24,541 --> 02:10:27,625
They would've just stood on the sides
and watched us hitting each other.

1185
02:10:28,125 --> 02:10:31,250
They didn't have to see it.
The word travels fast.

1186
02:10:31,541 --> 02:10:34,208
These people have seen it.
Soon the whole town will know.

1187
02:10:44,208 --> 02:10:45,416
Swamy Naidu.

1188
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:49,125
Give me nine-inch slippers.

1189
02:10:54,708 --> 02:10:57,166
They say he thrashed you
in front of a crowd.

1190
02:10:57,625 --> 02:11:00,625
People are asking me
if you have learned your lesson finally.

1191
02:11:01,041 --> 02:11:02,708
It's so embarrassing.

1192
02:11:03,166 --> 02:11:06,625
How many times did I tell you
not to get into fights?

1193
02:11:06,708 --> 02:11:08,000
You never listened to me.

1194
02:11:08,125 --> 02:11:09,375
You are suffering now.

1195
02:11:10,458 --> 02:11:12,666
-By the way, who is that guy?
-Hey!

1196
02:11:13,125 --> 02:11:14,750
It pains because of the bruises.

1197
02:11:15,666 --> 02:11:16,833
I've got bruises, too.

1198
02:11:20,208 --> 02:11:21,625
Heard that your hand is sprained.

1199
02:11:22,291 --> 02:11:24,250
If it doesn't heal faster,

1200
02:11:24,833 --> 02:11:26,916
Babji can fix it up in no time.

1201
02:11:27,500 --> 02:11:29,291
He mended my injuries within a few days.

1202
02:11:29,541 --> 02:11:30,916
Why don't you go to him, son?

1203
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:34,500
Someone hit him too hard.
His shoulder is dislocated.

1204
02:11:43,916 --> 02:11:46,125
I'm not a great fighter or something.

1205
02:11:46,625 --> 02:11:48,750
But I had no other option. Sorry.

1206
02:11:49,958 --> 02:11:52,166
-Is this the guy who beat you up?
-Yes, it was me.

1207
02:12:01,083 --> 02:12:03,041
Jyothi and I are in love with each other.

1208
02:12:03,833 --> 02:12:05,625
I want to marry her.

1209
02:12:05,708 --> 02:12:07,666
Wow! Sounds so great!

1210
02:12:08,250 --> 02:12:09,791
What do you say, Jognath?
