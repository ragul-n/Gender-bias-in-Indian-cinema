00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:21,226

00:02:34,962 --> 00:02:36,170
[engine turns off]

7
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:39,615
[in Hindi]:
Show me who is that, rascal!

8
00:02:42,657 --> 00:02:43,690
He isn't here, bro.

9
00:02:44,526 --> 00:02:45,557
Where has he gone?

10
00:02:46,076 --> 00:02:47,356
That rascal has hit my man.

11
00:02:47,656 --> 00:02:48,719
Who is that fellow?

12
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,240
-I don't know, sir. I don't know.
-Don't you know? Don't you?

13
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,631
[groans]

14
00:02:54,163 --> 00:02:55,746
-Hey, wait!
-Ah!

15
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,169
Come out if you are a man.

16
00:02:59,491 --> 00:03:01,872
-Ouch! Ah!
-Come out rascal!

17
00:03:33,342 --> 00:03:34,413
Who are you, man?

18
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,885
My name is Shiva... Born
in Vijayawada, brought up in Hyderabad.

19
00:03:44,927 --> 00:03:46,341
I wouldn't forgot you if we just meet.

20
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,189
But if it's a fight,
you wouldn't forget me.

21
00:03:48,913 --> 00:03:51,744
This isn't any information...
It's a warning.

22
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:53,531
[in Hindi]: Bro, it's him.

23
00:03:54,007 --> 00:03:57,262
Rascal, how dare you lay
hands on my men and warn us too?

24
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,869
You are finished now. You are finished!

25
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:01,257
Hey, get him!

26
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:02,854
Hey!

27
00:04:08,368 --> 00:04:11,864
Hey, you shouldn't mess up with me...

28
00:04:13,089 --> 00:04:15,240
If I my hand get's started...

29
00:04:16,815 --> 00:04:18,783
Your body would start trembling.

30
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:22,453
Hey!

31
00:04:27,646 --> 00:04:30,083
Richter scale would break down.

32
00:04:30,744 --> 00:04:31,744
Hey!

33
00:04:33,392 --> 00:04:35,591
Aye!

34
00:04:42,396 --> 00:04:43,439
Hey!

35
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,252
Ah!

36
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:14,665
Hey!

37
00:05:14,865 --> 00:05:17,679
Hey! Ah!

38
00:05:21,702 --> 00:05:25,142
Hey!

39
00:05:28,217 --> 00:05:29,267
Hey!

40
00:05:37,188 --> 00:05:38,201
Hey!

41
00:05:40,585 --> 00:05:41,657
Hey! Ah!

42
00:05:45,832 --> 00:05:46,832
Pratap!

43
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,666
Hey! This is Maharastra not our state.

44
00:05:54,072 --> 00:05:55,650
It has been just few
days that you joined here,

45
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,620
Would you mess up with workers?

46
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,178
He didn't fix the elevator cable properly.
People might die if it fails.

47
00:06:00,378 --> 00:06:01,378
But nothing happened, right?

48
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:04,524
[in Hindi]: Boss,
from today no one will work here.

49
00:06:04,724 --> 00:06:06,952
[in Telugu]: Dali... he is new here,

50
00:06:07,152 --> 00:06:08,993
I will explain him,
you don't stop our work.

51
00:06:09,293 --> 00:06:10,717
I will give you whatever you need.

52
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,463
[in Hindi]: I am leaving you
because, he is requesting.

53
00:06:13,663 --> 00:06:14,935
I'll deal with you later.

54
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,154
Fire him from the job.

55
00:06:19,763 --> 00:06:21,223
He will do another
mistake if you let him go.

56
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,613
-Rascal! Why are you provoking?
-Hey, Dali... Dali!

57
00:06:23,813 --> 00:06:25,838
Hey! You learned Telugu with just a punch?

58
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:27,038
-Hey, you...
-Hey, Dali!

59
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:28,238
Hey, stop!

60
00:06:28,438 --> 00:06:30,508
Boss, fire him...

61
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,123
Else tell him to apologize.

62
00:06:32,328 --> 00:06:34,113
-Say sorry, rascal!
-Hell no!

63
00:06:34,313 --> 00:06:35,363
Stop it guys!

64
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:36,563
What are you doing?

65
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:40,053
I hired you because your father was my
childhood friend and requested me to.

66
00:06:40,253 --> 00:06:41,253
But you created a scene.

67
00:06:41,453 --> 00:06:42,153
Say 'sorry'!

68
00:06:42,353 --> 00:06:44,350
I don't like that word, and the
people who ask me to say it as well.

69
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,479
My business would collapse
if you don't say 'sorry'.

70
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:48,202
Would your father pay up for my loss?

71
00:06:48,402 --> 00:06:49,402
Ow!

72
00:06:49,602 --> 00:06:50,986
Talk with respect, man!

73
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,223
How dare you hit me?
You're fired.

74
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:59,068
[men laughing]

75
00:06:59,703 --> 00:07:00,765
Thank you, brother.

76
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:02,975
Did you expect an apology?

77
00:07:03,461 --> 00:07:04,516
You lost the job, right?

78
00:07:05,085 --> 00:07:07,895
Basically, I've done this to lose my job.

79
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,380
Lose your job? Why?

80
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:12,797
I am missing my
family for past two days.

81
00:07:13,293 --> 00:07:14,970
It's been just two days, my boy?

82
00:07:15,408 --> 00:07:17,477
When I complained on
someone who committed a mistake,

83
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:20,889
They've labelled me wrong and
got me attacked by goons mom.

84
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:22,867
Oh no! Is it?

85
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,331
I became skinny mom,
you can't take it if you see me.

86
00:07:25,531 --> 00:07:26,736
I am coming back to Hyderabad.

87
00:07:26,936 --> 00:07:27,943
We are going to Vijayawada.

88
00:07:28,143 --> 00:07:29,375
Your dad got transffered.

89
00:07:29,827 --> 00:07:31,382
Why didn't you tell me about it, mom?

90
00:07:31,582 --> 00:07:33,738
Did you think I was dead
or wanted to get rid of me?

91
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,204
Why are you talking like that?

92
00:07:35,404 --> 00:07:37,923
Since this call began,

93
00:07:38,123 --> 00:07:39,901
You asked me to come home many times,

94
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:42,999
How can I not listen to you, mom?

95
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,360
Alright, come back.

96
00:07:45,461 --> 00:07:46,532
Did he quit the job?

97
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,907
-What's his problem?
-Well, he complained on someone...

98
00:07:52,283 --> 00:07:53,906
But they've fired him instead.

99
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:57,012
Wont you change?
Would moms like you ever change?

100
00:07:57,362 --> 00:07:58,936
Would you melt by his tears?

101
00:07:59,136 --> 00:08:00,229
That is why he called you.

102
00:08:00,676 --> 00:08:03,551
He wouldn't have a problem, he might
have become a problem for someone else.

103
00:08:04,385 --> 00:08:05,938
You think he's sad out there?

104
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:08,318
He might be enjoying there, I belive.

105
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,805
I know him well since 30 years.

106
00:08:11,238 --> 00:08:12,921
He didn't study, neither has a job.

107
00:08:13,121 --> 00:08:14,284
He likes living like that.

108
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:16,511
I'm tired and hopeless.

109
00:08:17,202 --> 00:08:20,683
You started annyoing
me that he like's construction,

110
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:22,253
I begged my friend and got
him hired in his company.

111
00:08:22,453 --> 00:08:23,478
But he couldn't stay
for at least two days.

112
00:08:24,328 --> 00:08:26,335
He is good for nothing.

113
00:08:27,386 --> 00:08:29,089
[birds chirping]

114
00:08:41,957 --> 00:08:42,986
My child!

115
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:44,319
-Mom!
-Mom!

116
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,140
-How are you, mom?
-I am good, my son.

117
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,593
Damn!

118
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:53,974
By the way, looks like
you gained some weight?

119
00:08:54,174 --> 00:08:55,308
What happened to you,
dear? You became skinny?

120
00:08:56,651 --> 00:08:57,759
I didn't have food mother,

121
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:59,939
Your thoughts kept me alive.
I was living on my tears.

122
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,742
Would he ever change?

123
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:02,968
Only his age has changed.

124
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,441
He was 20 when you last saw him.

125
00:09:04,859 --> 00:09:06,817
-Now, he is 30 years old.
-What thirty..?

126
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,716
-Hope you are fine?
-Yes, I am fine.

127
00:09:09,764 --> 00:09:10,920
-Yeah, go.
-Fine.

128
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,510
Hey, oldy! You look so strong.

129
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,488
What are you eating,
you're living so long?

130
00:09:14,841 --> 00:09:18,005
I am doing some house hold chores
too other than just eating.

131
00:09:18,205 --> 00:09:20,078
Who is gonna feed me,
if I sit without doing anything?

132
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:21,513
Are you kidding me?

133
00:09:21,713 --> 00:09:23,452
Or else what,
who's going to sit doing nothing?

134
00:09:23,652 --> 00:09:26,254
What do I do? The world is moving
further and we are stuck here.

135
00:09:26,454 --> 00:09:28,054
Why are you still here,
you should also have moved further, right?

136
00:09:28,254 --> 00:09:30,833
Grandpa died three years ago, then why
are you still here, why didn't you go?

137
00:09:31,033 --> 00:09:32,033
He is irritating me.

138
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:33,755
Few things can't be
understood, leave it.

139
00:09:33,955 --> 00:09:35,888
I like construction business.

140
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,307
If your son had encouraged me in it,

141
00:09:38,507 --> 00:09:39,749
I would have ruled the world you know.

142
00:09:42,701 --> 00:09:44,511
Alright, take this bag in.

143
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:47,473
I'll go meet my childhood
friends in Vijayawada.

144
00:09:47,908 --> 00:09:52,141
Hey, slow down this
isn't Hyderabad it's Vijayawada.

145
00:09:55,673 --> 00:09:58,048
You tell them sir,
or at least you,

146
00:09:58,248 --> 00:10:02,285
This is my shop, sir.
I bought this shop working very hard.

147
00:10:02,722 --> 00:10:06,577
Why should I handover this
shop if someone comes and asks for it.

148
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:09,936
Should I be afraid, if it
is Kashi or his brother?

149
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,520
If you want to occupy this shop, you
need to cross my dead body, man.

150
00:10:15,734 --> 00:10:18,514
Tell me, would you do that?
Or should I lit myself?

151
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:20,416
Huh? Tell me!

152
00:10:38,163 --> 00:10:41,084
[fire crackles]
[screams in pain]

153
00:10:46,097 --> 00:10:48,018
[chaos] If I want, I
just want it. That's it.

154
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:53,056
Not a single dead body,
I will cross mountains for it.

155
00:10:56,682 --> 00:10:58,792
Pothineni Tata Rao!

156
00:11:01,116 --> 00:11:02,381
M. Shiva Rama Krishna!

157
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:03,636
When did you come, dude?

158
00:11:03,836 --> 00:11:07,015
Where are you? How are you? Wha are
you doing? How much are you earning?

159
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:09,016
Approx rupees 45,000, man.

160
00:11:09,216 --> 00:11:11,739
Oh my God! Forty five
thousand? What job are you doing?

161
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:14,179
My dad is a government
employee, he earns rupees 35,000.

162
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:16,375
Younger brother is an engineer he earns
rupees 10,000. Total is rupees 45,000.

163
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:17,650
Which means, you are doing nothing?

164
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,127
I didn't get a job
which suits me,

165
00:11:19,327 --> 00:11:21,355
And dad didn't support me for the
business. No one understood me.

166
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:22,555
Who you are talking to, man?

167
00:11:22,755 --> 00:11:25,258
Dad, did you recognise him?
He is M. Shiva Rama Krishna.

168
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,768
He is the same guy who sold your
bicycle for Venkat Rao's school fee.,

169
00:11:28,968 --> 00:11:29,968
This is him father.

170
00:11:30,174 --> 00:11:32,529
Hey, did I tell you not to
make idiots your friends?

171
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:34,908
Will we leave our childhood
friend though he is an idiot, uncle?

172
00:11:35,108 --> 00:11:36,729
I am talking about you.

173
00:11:36,936 --> 00:11:38,169
Your dad didn't stop joking, dude.

174
00:11:38,652 --> 00:11:40,804
Hey, it's getting late for the
event. Stop this and leave.

175
00:11:41,841 --> 00:11:42,933
-Dude,
-Huh?

176
00:11:43,216 --> 00:11:46,792
When Vijayawada is very happy,
then why did my grandma scare me?

177
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,452
Leave it.

178
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:54,786
-Hey!
-Hey!

179
00:11:55,077 --> 00:11:56,361
Dude, don't shout.

180
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,745
Is he a mad, can't he see?

181
00:11:58,945 --> 00:12:00,364
No one, will question even
if he kills someone here.

182
00:12:00,564 --> 00:12:02,730
-What?
-His name is Rakesh, Kashi's brother.

183
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,585
-Who is Kashi?
-Like a house is owned by a person,

184
00:12:04,785 --> 00:12:06,738
or a car owned by a
person, he owns this city.

185
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:14,591
Rowdyism, crime, mafia...

186
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,101
all together is Kashi.

187
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,923
But they said rowdyism
has come down in Vijayawada?

188
00:12:22,123 --> 00:12:25,732
Yes, it has, dude.
He is doing the job of 100 people.

189
00:12:25,932 --> 00:12:27,364
He is mad about wealth.

190
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,080
He killed his own uncle for wealth.

191
00:12:31,472 --> 00:12:33,221
[knife swishes]
[groans]

192
00:12:34,316 --> 00:12:36,282
He wouldn't let it go
if he eyes on something.

193
00:12:37,294 --> 00:12:38,996
He would question if we see him.

194
00:12:39,472 --> 00:12:41,254
If we don't see he says,
why aren't you seeing when I have come.

195
00:12:41,724 --> 00:12:42,966
He is egoistic.

196
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:45,836
His ego is such...

197
00:12:47,944 --> 00:12:49,208
Can you see the mall?

198
00:12:50,894 --> 00:12:52,087
He occupied that land and built it.

199
00:12:52,287 --> 00:12:54,259
It was inaugurated exactly a year ago.

200
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:59,135
Dude... Kasi is here.

201
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:05,825
Did Koti bro come?

202
00:13:06,126 --> 00:13:07,253
He is getting ready it seems.

203
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,098
[phone rings]
[siren wailing at distance]

204
00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:12,132
Hello?

205
00:13:12,906 --> 00:13:14,212
-What?
-What happened?

206
00:13:15,388 --> 00:13:17,681
It seems that he fell on
the ground while rushing.

207
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,165
-Koti bro's leg got fractured it seems.
-Damn!

208
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:25,352
We have called only him for the
opening. What should we do now?

209
00:13:25,552 --> 00:13:28,609
Hey, he is a politician and this guy is
a goon. Why would he come, he will not.

210
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:31,954
Hey, how would it be if he appears in a
photo with the minister in a news paper?

211
00:13:32,154 --> 00:13:33,208
It would look odd.

212
00:13:38,356 --> 00:13:39,392
-[indistinct chatter]
-Boss...

213
00:13:39,592 --> 00:13:41,324
Boss... Minister's car has started.

214
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,943
But not for the opening,
but to his guest house.

215
00:13:45,143 --> 00:13:46,928
He lied to you because he
don't like to come, boss.

216
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,674
[music]

217
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,512
What is this brother?
How many things I have done for you?

218
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:17,765
I asked you for the first time
to come to the opening ceremony.

219
00:14:18,286 --> 00:14:20,097
I thought your presence
alone would be enough for me.

220
00:14:20,477 --> 00:14:24,672
But you come to her?
That too you lied to me.

221
00:14:24,952 --> 00:14:27,735
Kasi, I am a politician.

222
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:29,885
We give assurances but
won't give you a word.

223
00:14:30,085 --> 00:14:33,305
How can I say whether I will come or
not when a person like you is asking?

224
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:34,957
You need to understand.

225
00:14:35,172 --> 00:14:38,521
There are rumours that you
and I are having connections.

226
00:14:39,002 --> 00:14:42,338
If I come and cut the
ribbon, it will become true.

227
00:14:42,538 --> 00:14:44,643
Still,
we shouldn't trust this media people.

228
00:14:44,893 --> 00:14:46,893
The time I cut the ribbon,

229
00:14:47,093 --> 00:14:51,573
they'll telecast it a million times.

230
00:14:51,773 --> 00:14:53,874
and totally they will tarnish image.

231
00:14:55,821 --> 00:14:58,349
Whatever but you are a goon.

232
00:14:59,496 --> 00:15:03,351
And I am a MLA of an area,
more over I am a minister.

233
00:15:04,923 --> 00:15:07,459
We should be together
in between four walls,

234
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:10,026
but when we go out we have to
act as if we don't know eachother.

235
00:15:10,226 --> 00:15:12,838
You have to condemn if
someone says we are linked to each other.

236
00:15:13,794 --> 00:15:15,633
To put it in plain words,

237
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,598
we have to meet someone
like her and someone like you,

238
00:15:18,798 --> 00:15:20,188
only in the dark, man.

239
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:21,921
Ah!

240
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:24,083
Ah!

241
00:15:24,828 --> 00:15:27,495
What did you say?
You compared me with her?

242
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:29,602
Is it a shame for you
to inaugurate my mall?

243
00:15:29,802 --> 00:15:31,068
Which leg is broken?

244
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:36,101
Right leg? Left leg?
Left leg, is it? Tell me!

245
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:38,185
[screams in pain]

246
00:15:43,784 --> 00:15:44,792

-Yeah?

00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:55,855
Cut it, brother.

250
00:15:57,741 --> 00:15:59,506
Photos should look
awesome in the newspapers.

251

[laughs]
[crowd applauds]

252
00:16:02,035 --> 00:16:04,294
If Minister has come even after
his leg is fractured that means...

253
00:16:05,328 --> 00:16:06,821
Kasi isn't an ordinary person.

254
00:16:10,842 --> 00:16:12,159
What is with Kasi?

255
00:16:12,448 --> 00:16:14,619
Did you at least understand now,
why your grandma, asked you to stay calm?

256
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:18,542
Why are you thinking about that Kasi,
dude? Look how colorful the life is...

257
00:16:18,742 --> 00:16:19,782
Come on, let's enjoy.

258
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:22,336
Why are you so late, man?
Everyone are here?

259
00:16:22,536 --> 00:16:23,888
Do you know,
we didn't recieve our advance payment?

260
00:16:24,088 --> 00:16:25,221

about their well being."

-Hello!
-Where are you?

274
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,587
You asked me to attend the
Sangeeth event, right?

275
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,466
I am asking, when did I tell you?

276
00:17:22,982 --> 00:17:25,593
I am your boss, you think I'm a fool?

277
00:17:25,793 --> 00:17:28,497
To pay you salary and send
you to events and marriages?

278
00:17:28,697 --> 00:17:31,709
But sir, we are the event
managers for this program, right?

279
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,023
But, you asked someone
to come at 4:30 pm, right?

280
00:17:34,223 --> 00:17:36,219
Sir, it was you who told me to.

281
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,230
Alright, you better be here soon.

Please stop here. Stop! Stop!

I am the boss here.

-Your job is done.
-Sir, I am here.

Tell her what you need.

292
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:17,877
We need a presentation.

293
00:18:18,077 --> 00:18:19,740
I gave a brief, did you make it?

294
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:21,419
What is he saying?

295
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,914
It seems that they have
give you a brief of the event.

296
00:18:24,114 --> 00:18:25,195
When did they give me?

297
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,307
Do they think that don't have a
briefcase and suitcase?

298
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:31,714
Brief means, the requirment, sir.

299

Why are you still staring at me?
Brief them.

300

I am the boss and you are an employee.

case and suit case to give a presentation?

Did you tell them about my affairs too?

311

Chintamani as Cinthol, Lakshmi as Lux...

Do event managers have fans too?

00:20:57,628 --> 00:20:59,588
Ah? Why are you dull Mr?

346
00:20:59,788 --> 00:21:00,824
I have a problem, sir.

347
00:21:01,024 --> 00:21:03,006
Why do you care,
you met your fans, that's enough.

348
00:21:03,206 --> 00:21:04,992
It won't be enough, you are my fans.

349
00:21:05,192 --> 00:21:06,568
Your happiness is my happiness.

350
00:21:06,768 --> 00:21:07,879
And your pain is my pain.

351
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,157
I willl get hurt if you
don't tell your problem.

352
00:21:10,357 --> 00:21:12,758
-Oh God!
-I fell for a girl at the first sight.

353
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,446
Didn't she love you back?

354
00:21:14,646 --> 00:21:15,749
She ignores me, sir.

355
00:21:15,949 --> 00:21:17,245
Even if I touch her
she doesn't care, sir.

356
00:21:17,445 --> 00:21:19,901
Her skin might be senseless.

357
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:24,059
She should be in love by now, but she's
working day and night without leisure.

358
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,952
Pity, she isn't doing any work
other than the work given by her boss.

359
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:27,852
Is it?

360
00:21:28,052 --> 00:21:29,262
She sat on my bike, sir.

361
00:21:29,562 --> 00:21:31,351
She didn't even recognise
me when we met again.

362
00:21:31,551 --> 00:21:32,551
Oh!

363
00:21:32,928 --> 00:21:34,944
I couldn't see my
girlfriend doing such hardwork, sir.

364
00:21:35,144 --> 00:21:38,782
Do you mean to say that, you also
want to work and share her problem?

365
00:21:38,982 --> 00:21:41,395
-I am thinking to make her jobless.
-Ah?

366
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,029
She would be happy, right?

367
00:21:43,556 --> 00:21:44,592
I like you, man.

368
00:21:45,116 --> 00:21:47,016
You can't see your girlfriend working.

369
00:21:47,216 --> 00:21:48,987
Then, make her resign,
what's the problem?

370
00:21:49,187 --> 00:21:50,775
-Her boss.
-How he looks?

371
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,619
He looks very ugly, sir.

372
00:21:54,485 --> 00:21:57,125
He looks like a socks which isn't
washed in the past 6 months.

373
00:21:57,425 --> 00:21:59,912
-To be frank he doesn't look like you.
-Ah?

374
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:00,812
Yes.

375
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,479
-Bloody rascal!
-Cool down...

376
00:22:02,745 --> 00:22:03,745
-Control...
-Cool down, cool.

377
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:06,547
He is torturing my girlfriend, sir.

378
00:22:06,747 --> 00:22:07,747
Oh!

379
00:22:08,684 --> 00:22:10,787
Making her do all sorts of work,

380
00:22:11,257 --> 00:22:14,648
He ruined her glamour sir.

381
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,494
-What should I do to him, sir?
-Hit him.

382
00:22:17,694 --> 00:22:18,694
That would be enough.

383
00:22:18,924 --> 00:22:19,924
Ah!

384
00:22:20,425 --> 00:22:23,000
You are unfit. You are fired.

385
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,575
-Sir...
-Get out!

[parrot squawking]

387
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:45,360
-Thanks.
-You are welcome.

388
00:22:46,063 --> 00:22:47,300
Looks like you are very upset.

389
00:22:48,217 --> 00:22:50,103
Won't anyone get upset if
someone says 'you are unfit'?

390
00:22:50,767 --> 00:22:52,445
I have done so much for him.

391
00:22:52,752 --> 00:22:55,452
I couldn't increase his height, but...

392
00:22:55,868 --> 00:22:57,884
I increased his office to seven floors.

393
00:22:58,508 --> 00:23:00,600
How could he fire me from the job?

394
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,924
He says I am fit for nothing.

395
00:23:04,036 --> 00:23:06,949
Do you know, if it was anyone
else they would have died.

396
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,409
If so, then I should die 100 times a day.

397
00:23:09,844 --> 00:23:10,860
What do you mean?

398
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:14,596
The way we hear music in
Sankarabharanam Shankara Sastry's house,

399
00:23:14,796 --> 00:23:17,331
In my house my family members
scold me, for everything.

400
00:23:18,144 --> 00:23:20,156
I am talking to you,
you are fit for nothing.

401
00:23:20,356 --> 00:23:21,477
We are dying to feed you.

402
00:23:22,315 --> 00:23:25,799
Hey, how are you living
without doing any job?

403
00:23:25,999 --> 00:23:27,439
-Hey, Anand give me some money.
-I don't have, man.

404
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,339
-Hey, come on, sure you will have.
-Hey, leave!

405
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:30,880
You say you don't have
but you have enough money.

406
00:23:31,228 --> 00:23:32,816
Even after bearing this
much, look at me...

407
00:23:33,283 --> 00:23:36,861
how happy and joyful I am.

408
00:23:37,493 --> 00:23:39,082
Still, why God gave us ears?

409
00:23:39,282 --> 00:23:39,982
For what?

410
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,874
For not listening the
things we don't like.

411
00:23:42,074 --> 00:23:43,515
-Then, what about mouth?
-To change the words.

412
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,427
You just lost your job, not your life.

413
00:23:46,627 --> 00:23:49,452
You should throw such
silly matters in dust bin,

414
00:23:49,652 --> 00:23:52,056
but you can't move on in life
if you keep them into your head.

415
00:23:52,356 --> 00:23:54,524
If we give our parents life
becuase they gave us birth,

416
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,728
and boss because he gave us salary,

417
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,200
then when will you give time to yourself?

418
00:23:59,074 --> 00:24:01,104
Still, what happened to you
why are you feeling upset?

419
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:03,904
Aren't you beautiful, don't you have
courage. don't you have a boyfriend,

420
00:24:04,104 --> 00:24:06,548
don't you have a friend,
don't you have a guide, or a philosopher.

421
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:10,750
Leave these. Let's go to that Coffee Day
and have a coffee and enjoy the life.

422
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,646
Hey,
when did they opened the coffee day here?

423
00:24:15,846 --> 00:24:17,861
Thank God,
for not asking when I was born.

424
00:24:18,061 --> 00:24:19,368
Sorry, I didn't notice.

425
00:24:19,578 --> 00:24:21,047
That is why I am saying to see.

426
00:24:21,247 --> 00:24:23,585
Look how nice the sky is,

427
00:24:23,785 --> 00:24:25,733
look at the ground,
how green and nice it looks.

Look here, not there this side,

don't you feel like
loving love at first sight?

430
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:32,345
-Love who?
-Your life.

431
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,483
Look how beautiful your smile is...

432
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:35,584
You should always keep smiling.

433
00:24:35,784 --> 00:24:37,509
That waste fellow, I mean, your boss,

434
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,302
he should cry seeing you.

435
00:24:40,292 --> 00:24:42,191

00:31:05,442 --> 00:31:06,730
Please, don't stop me.

516
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:07,979
I mean...

517
00:31:08,423 --> 00:31:09,436
You wait here.

518
00:31:12,286 --> 00:31:13,494
Hey, who are you?

519
00:31:14,071 --> 00:31:18,369
I am the secretary who lie to you daily
when you call thrice a day to check,

520
00:31:18,584 --> 00:31:21,187
whether your husband is in office or not.

521
00:31:21,387 --> 00:31:22,161
-Move!
-Ah!

522
00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:23,575
-Hey, Rajesh!
-Hey!

523
00:31:23,783 --> 00:31:24,790
Ah!

524
00:31:26,249 --> 00:31:28,514
Oh no! They are expensive.

525
00:31:28,714 --> 00:31:30,877
Move! Where are you hiding like a pussy?

526
00:31:40,638 --> 00:31:41,718
[glass breaks]

527
00:31:44,537 --> 00:31:45,554
Come out.

528
00:31:46,961 --> 00:31:48,737
What did you say, am I unfit?

529
00:31:50,345 --> 00:31:52,673
-I will kill you!
-[groans]

530
00:31:52,873 --> 00:31:54,763
-Ah!
-You are finished.

531
00:31:54,963 --> 00:31:55,707
-You?
-You?

532
00:31:55,907 --> 00:31:56,980
I caught him,
while he is trying to escape.

533
00:31:57,191 --> 00:31:59,224
Where are you trying to escape?
I will...

534
00:31:59,424 --> 00:32:00,496
Hey, stop it!

535
00:32:01,017 --> 00:32:02,710
You must hit him, not me.

536
00:32:03,938 --> 00:32:05,089
Why should I hit him?

537
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:06,510
I am asking why?

538
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:08,210
He is a friend who is gifted by God to me.

539
00:32:08,585 --> 00:32:10,747
You are so short,

540
00:32:10,947 --> 00:32:11,947
why should I listen to you?

541
00:32:12,203 --> 00:32:14,463
-Because he...
-Come on, say it!

542
00:32:14,941 --> 00:32:16,031
What will you do if I say?

543
00:32:16,231 --> 00:32:18,617
-What soap does he use at home?
- He uses only Life boy.

544
00:32:18,817 --> 00:32:19,978
What about outside, then?

545
00:32:20,282 --> 00:32:21,768
About what are you talking?

546
00:32:21,968 --> 00:32:25,016
About Cinthol, Lux, Santoor,

547
00:32:25,216 --> 00:32:27,476
-Medimix...
-Hey, listen,

548
00:32:27,888 --> 00:32:30,224
I won't tell your girlfriend anything.

549
00:32:30,806 --> 00:32:33,404
-Don't tell anything to me to my wife.
-Fine, I won't.

550
00:32:33,663 --> 00:32:35,418
What would he say? I will say it.

551
00:32:38,913 --> 00:32:41,492
Look... Cinthol stands for Chintamani,

552
00:32:41,692 --> 00:32:43,585
Santoor stands for Sandy,
Lux stands for Lakshmi,

553
00:32:43,897 --> 00:32:44,897
-Medimix stands for Madhavi.
-What kind of a person are you?

554
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:46,638
-They are all his mistresses.
-Rajesh!

555
00:32:46,838 --> 00:32:48,408
Ah! I beg you.

556
00:32:48,608 --> 00:32:50,186
I will see your end to night. Damn!

557
00:32:51,691 --> 00:32:52,691
Hey, Rajesh...

558
00:32:52,909 --> 00:32:54,453
This is called 'Tit for Tat'!

559
00:32:54,654 --> 00:32:56,431
Hell with you.

560
00:32:56,728 --> 00:33:00,794
Do you know how would it be to
carry an unpinned granade with you?

561
00:33:00,994 --> 00:33:01,710
What's that?

562
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:04,851
He's the one who slapped me
to fire you from the job.

563
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,480
That is why I fired you.

564
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,895
He is not your friend.

565
00:33:08,095 --> 00:33:09,099
He is your enemy.

566
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,197
Shiva!

567
00:33:17,834 --> 00:33:19,363
Won't you tell me unless I
ask about why you did this?

568
00:33:23,172 --> 00:33:24,191
I love you!

569
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:26,925
Love at first sight.

570
00:33:27,126 --> 00:33:29,644
The problem is,
your mind and heart aren't free.

571
00:33:30,016 --> 00:33:31,953
For you to love me you must
know how much I love you.

572
00:33:32,283 --> 00:33:33,632
That means, you should get to know me.

573
00:33:33,832 --> 00:33:36,012
You should have time for it, that means,
you should be fired from your job.

574
00:33:36,212 --> 00:33:37,305
That is why I did this.

575
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,920
Now, we have a lot of peaceful time.

576
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,724
-You are happy, right?
-You rascal!

577
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,428
You are jobless but why
did you got me fired, man?

578
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:49,267
Do you know how
important that job is for me?

579
00:33:49,665 --> 00:33:51,987
Do you know how many lives
are dependent on that salary?

580
00:33:52,433 --> 00:33:53,834
Wait, I am coming.

581
00:33:54,652 --> 00:33:56,659
Hey, it's ok if you lost your job.

582
00:33:56,969 --> 00:33:58,706
But I don't like you
working in this house.

583
00:33:58,906 --> 00:34:00,227
Hey, this is my house.

584
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:02,100
Your house?

585
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:03,525
Who are they?

586
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:04,951
They are orphans.

587
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:07,485
I've adopted them and giving them proper
food and education. Is that ok?

588
00:34:07,685 --> 00:34:09,116
Isn't it too much?

589
00:34:09,316 --> 00:34:11,679
You don't have anyone
and you want them both?

590
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:12,629
Shut up!

591
00:34:12,846 --> 00:34:14,190
I don't know what you would do,

592
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:15,484
I lost my job because of you.

593
00:34:15,684 --> 00:34:18,205
Take care of me until I get another job.

594
00:34:18,405 --> 00:34:20,749
Crap! What are those
words? Taking care of you?

595
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:21,952
Shut up!

596
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:25,689
From today, my rent, electricity
bill, food,

597
00:34:25,988 --> 00:34:28,990
from hair clip till every small
thing, you are responsible.

598
00:34:29,244 --> 00:34:30,253
Give him the groceries list.

599
00:34:35,152 --> 00:34:39,288
Excuse me, I have seen monthly
maintenance and yearly maintenance but,

600
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,865
this looks like your
life long maintainance.

601
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:43,792
Hey, this is for one month.

602
00:34:43,992 --> 00:34:45,771
-To eat or to resell?
-To eat it.

603
00:34:45,971 --> 00:34:46,769
Go get them.

604
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:48,472
[billing machine beeps]
How much, madam?

605
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:49,688
It's nine thousand rupees, sir.

606
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:01,709
Here.

607
00:35:02,364 --> 00:35:05,026
Hey! You!

608
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:10,430
Hey! Where are you?

609
00:35:14,881 --> 00:35:16,834
Hey! Where are you?

610
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:19,577
-What happened sir?
-Some guy is running with my groceries.

611
00:35:19,777 --> 00:35:21,203
Hey! Just stop there.

612
00:35:26,471 --> 00:35:27,844
Hey! Who are you?

613
00:35:28,044 --> 00:35:30,492
Hey! Just stop there.

614
00:35:30,692 --> 00:35:33,305
Hey! Give my bag!

615
00:35:34,523 --> 00:35:36,489
Hey! Come here.

616
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:37,918
Hey!

617
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,380
Hey! Stop there. Stop!

618
00:35:48,642 --> 00:35:50,587
Thief! Thief!

619
00:35:52,606 --> 00:35:54,272
Hey! Move aside.

620
00:35:54,472 --> 00:35:56,785
Who are you?

621
00:35:58,082 --> 00:36:01,499
Both of you just stop.

622
00:36:06,919 --> 00:36:08,605
-Hey!
-Can't you see me?

623
00:36:08,838 --> 00:36:10,080
I was driving correctly.

624
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,496
Who are you?

625
00:36:22,963 --> 00:36:24,406
That's my vehicle. Stop there.

626
00:36:33,888 --> 00:36:35,092
-You!
-Please leave me.

627
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:36,913
No I don't. That is my hard earned money.

628
00:36:37,113 --> 00:36:40,856
Sir, you can afford to buy groceries
again. But' I'm so poor. Please leave me.

629
00:36:41,218 --> 00:36:43,712
You words have a lot of respect
towards me. Are you really a thief?

630
00:36:44,296 --> 00:36:45,581
Remove your face mask. Remove it.

631
00:36:46,262 --> 00:36:47,966
Sorry, sir. Sorry!

632
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:49,805
-[screaming]
-Oh no!

633
00:36:51,887 --> 00:36:52,994
It looks like a wonder to me.

634
00:36:53,198 --> 00:36:55,419
We have seen people robbing
money from the customers of the bank.

635
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,661
We have seen people who rob
the jewelry from the pedestrians.

636
00:36:57,861 --> 00:36:59,335
But I haven't seen
people who rob the groceries.

637
00:37:00,152 --> 00:37:02,633
That thief is a well known guy to us.

638
00:37:03,341 --> 00:37:05,072
He was so respectful before hitting me.

639
00:37:05,272 --> 00:37:06,676
He was apologizing for hitting me.

640
00:37:07,147 --> 00:37:10,298
-I won't leave him. Get some water.
-Okay.

641

-Hello!
-Murthy!

Already 14 days have
passed for your deadline.

644

Only 16 days are left.
Just sign the documents.

Murthy!
This house was built by your father.

It's seeping here and there.

647
00:37:41,555 --> 00:37:45,033
The repair costs upto 2 lakhs.
Just look into this matter once.

648
00:37:45,286 --> 00:37:47,044
Yeah! That's true.

649
00:37:47,324 --> 00:37:50,184
If the garden gets repaired I can grow
some flower plants and creepers there.

650
00:37:50,475 --> 00:37:53,729
It's okay. We will discuss it later.
I'm busy with some other work.

651
00:37:54,029 --> 00:37:57,625
-Don't ignore it. It's rainy season...
-I'll discuss about it later.

652
00:37:58,941 --> 00:38:00,028
Can't you understand my words?

653
00:38:01,525 --> 00:38:02,934
Why did you steal the groceries?

654
00:38:03,134 --> 00:38:05,605
It's necessity! Necessity will
always serve you new ideas.

655
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,965
If I had your intelligence I would have
setup a studio stealing my dad's cameras.

656
00:38:09,165 --> 00:38:10,809
-So why are you waiting? Do it now.
-What?

Nayana! Did you get all the
groceries you have asked for?

661
00:38:19,736 --> 00:38:21,892
The items doesn't match
with list of items I asked for.

662
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:23,336
He wouldn't have bought
the same items you asked for.

663
00:38:23,882 --> 00:38:24,687
Who was that?

664
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:27,463
You should adjust with
the groceries I bought you.

665
00:38:27,774 --> 00:38:30,599
Adjusting? Who will pay the kids
school fees and the house rent?

666
00:38:30,857 --> 00:38:32,555
What? How much does it costs?

667

Rs 20,000 and today is
the last day to pay it.

668

Take it.

675
00:39:05,904 --> 00:39:07,562
Who was that guy riding my bike?

676
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,255
What happened to my friend
M Sivaram Krishna?

00:39:41,699 --> 00:39:43,439
That's the reason I've called you.

690
00:39:43,919 --> 00:39:45,348
Tomorrow it's Diwali festival.

691
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:50,069
I promised children in my
apartment some fire works. Get some.

692
00:39:50,269 --> 00:39:53,749
If we spend all the money on other kids,
what will spend on you kids in future?

693
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:55,312
Shut up!

694
00:39:58,233 --> 00:39:59,068
Looks like a shining jewelry?

695
00:39:59,347 --> 00:40:02,777
Hey, that's the gift given by my deceased
grand mother. Take this balance amount.

696
00:40:02,977 --> 00:40:04,778
You're too shy to say that to me.

697
00:40:05,851 --> 00:40:07,300
-Dad!
-Yes!

698
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,415
I want Rs 7,000.

699
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:10,503
-For what?
-I should buy some crackers.

700
00:40:13,502 --> 00:40:14,800
-What?
-Yes, dad!

701
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,344
I should buy different kinds of crackers
which we light during Diwali.

702
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:24,272
-Hey! Come here.
-Mom! Are you giving me?

703
00:40:24,472 --> 00:40:27,077
You would have told me before.

704
00:40:27,498 --> 00:40:30,989
Look at your age and look at
your requirement for crackers.

705
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:38,578
Give me all the available
crackers in the shop for Rs 7000.

706
00:40:38,778 --> 00:40:40,186
-You want all the crackers for Rs 7,000?
-Yes!

707
00:40:40,386 --> 00:40:42,452
-Take your money. You can't these all.
-Give the crackers that worth my money.

708
00:40:42,652 --> 00:40:44,066
-Give me that large one.
-Okay!

709
00:40:44,293 --> 00:40:45,487
Give me a good one. It
should work properly.

710
00:40:46,469 --> 00:40:47,647
Give me a good one.

711
00:40:48,901 --> 00:40:51,773
Yes! Give me the one which is beside.

712
00:40:51,973 --> 00:40:53,663
Yeah. That's right.

713
00:40:53,863 --> 00:40:57,620
-Give me one rocket type cracker.
-Okay.

714
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,040
Just add to this bag. Hurry up!

715
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:03,124
I don't go! I don't!

716
00:41:03,803 --> 00:41:06,102
Are you dare enough to arrest me?

717
00:41:06,302 --> 00:41:08,298
Try to touch me.

718
00:41:08,498 --> 00:41:10,298
Sir, please send him.

719
00:41:10,498 --> 00:41:13,229
Already we have crossed the
limit by not attending the court.

720
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:21,565
Go, brother. Just check whether
the court area is feasible to occupy.

721
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,997
Don't worry you're Kasi's brother.

722
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:25,873
Visit the court and come.

723
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:27,937
We will celebrate Diwali happily.

724
00:41:28,137 --> 00:41:31,030
Hey lawyer, your time limit is 2 hours.

725
00:41:32,629 --> 00:41:38,021
After examining the primary evidences, it is
decided to remand Mr.Rakesh for 14 days.

726
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:41,649
You idiot!

727
00:41:44,787 --> 00:41:46,054
Sir! Sir! Sir!

728
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:49,995
I asked you come back in 2 hours, but
we his sent to remand for 14 days.

729
00:41:50,209 --> 00:41:52,605
Sir, we use this time
to get rid of the case.

730
00:41:52,805 --> 00:41:53,576
We have 14 days with us.

731
00:41:53,832 --> 00:41:57,963
I will misrepresent the evidences and
manage the Judges. He will come back.

732
00:42:00,715 --> 00:42:03,005
My brother was born on the day of Diwali.

733
00:42:03,205 --> 00:42:04,667
Today is his birthday.

734
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,099
I planned to celebrate his
birthday in the whole city.

735
00:42:07,299 --> 00:42:08,835
But he is not with me now.

736
00:42:09,035 --> 00:42:10,645
Sir, please sir.

737
00:42:10,845 --> 00:42:14,409
No one should celebrate
Diwali as my brother couldn't.

738
00:42:14,609 --> 00:42:15,884
-Boys!
-Brother!

739
00:42:16,084 --> 00:42:19,158
If anyone tries to burst crackers,

740
00:42:19,491 --> 00:42:22,648
warn them that I will burst
their heads along with it.

741
00:42:22,932 --> 00:42:25,966
There is no Diwali for the city this year.

742
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:36,663
[people screaming]

743
00:42:37,211 --> 00:42:41,393
[people screaming]

744
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,877
Looks like all of you are waiting for me.

745
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:02,124
Hey kids, here are the crackers.
Let's burn them. Come on!

746
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:07,101
-There is no festival for us this year.
-Is anyone of the family died?

747
00:43:07,301 --> 00:43:09,667
-Kasi's brother was sent to jail.
-So what?

748
00:43:09,867 --> 00:43:14,351
Are you new to this city? Confronting Kasi
is like getting into troubles by self.

749
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:16,145
First your fears are need to be burned.

750
00:43:17,322 --> 00:43:21,299
I don't get this. He is into jail as
he did a crime. What did kids do?

751
00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:22,789
Won't you let them to
celebrate the festival?

752
00:43:23,257 --> 00:43:25,474
Just look at them
with the dull faces.

753
00:43:25,674 --> 00:43:27,393
Sister, let's burn the crackers.

754
00:43:27,593 --> 00:43:29,099
No, dear. Just listen to me.

755
00:43:29,299 --> 00:43:30,715
Let's celebrate the
festival when he comes back.

756
00:43:30,915 --> 00:43:32,522
Please lets burn them.

757
00:43:33,212 --> 00:43:34,876
Just listen to me. Let's go inside.

758
00:43:35,076 --> 00:43:36,995
Nayana, let me explain.

759
00:43:38,966 --> 00:43:40,650
-You want to burn crackers.
-Yes, uncle.

760
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,816
-Which one?
-I will burn the rocket.

761
00:43:44,231 --> 00:43:46,315
Come! Kids, all of you, come on.

762
00:43:46,712 --> 00:43:47,777
Siva?

763
00:43:49,094 --> 00:43:52,141
We celebrate Diwali on the occasion of
killing an demon called 'Narakasura'.

764
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,235
Then it isn't a festival if a
demon called Rakesh is sent to jail?

765
00:44:15,721 --> 00:44:17,461
Uncle, are we doing this for sure?

766
00:44:18,082 --> 00:44:19,948
-Are you scared?
-Yes!

767
00:44:20,544 --> 00:44:22,402
I'm with you. Go ahead.

768
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:29,583
You know one thing. You're the
first to burn crackers in Bezawada.

769
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:32,441
-Festival is going to start with you.
-Is it?

770
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:33,791
Come on!

771
00:44:42,343 --> 00:44:44,146
Guys, some one is firing up the crackers.

772
00:44:53,846 --> 00:44:56,176
Don't fire the crackers. Stop it.

773
00:45:39,921 --> 00:45:44,314
[goons shouting]

774
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:49,891
Rakesh brother got released from
the jail. We can celebrate now.

775
00:45:53,695 --> 00:45:57,305
Did Rakesh brother get
released? Is that true?

776
00:46:30,307 --> 00:46:34,230
Sir, heard Rakesh brother got
released from the jail. Where is he?

777
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:36,947
How would an accused
in remand get released?

778
00:46:37,774 --> 00:46:39,274
Some one fooled us.

779
00:46:39,695 --> 00:46:42,945
He made the city to celebrate
even after I denied it. Who is he?

780
00:46:43,145 --> 00:46:46,155
[in unison] Thank you uncle!

781
00:46:46,355 --> 00:46:49,366
-[in unison] Happy Diwali!
-Uncle!

782
00:47:17,479 --> 00:47:19,583
-"Lovely!"
-"Can you get me crazy?"

783
00:47:19,783 --> 00:47:21,253
-"Lovely!"
-"Can you roll and rock me?"

784
00:47:21,857 --> 00:47:23,548
-"Lovely!"
-"By closing play me"

785
00:47:25,286 --> 00:47:26,940
-"Lovely!"
-"Can you get me crazy?"

786
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,256
-"Lovely!"
-"My beautiful baby"

787
00:47:29,456 --> 00:47:32,782
-"Lovely!"
-"By closing play me"

788
00:47:32,982 --> 00:47:34,402
"Boost girl"

789
00:47:35,064 --> 00:47:36,231
"Boost girl"

790
00:47:36,708 --> 00:47:40,143
"Give me a kiss which is booster"

791
00:47:40,602 --> 00:47:41,967
'Ghost girl"

792
00:47:42,414 --> 00:47:44,306
'Ghost girl"

793
00:47:44,506 --> 00:47:48,069
"Be a life ling guest in my life"

794
00:47:48,269 --> 00:47:51,771
"I totally belong to you"

795
00:47:52,112 --> 00:47:56,001
"This Mt. Everest of
beauty belongs to you"

796
00:47:56,201 --> 00:47:59,560
"I can't wait no longer"

797
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,535
"I want you to win over me"

798
00:48:03,735 --> 00:48:08,993
"Hey tattoo girl, let
me tie a knot to you."

799
00:48:09,193 --> 00:48:11,549
"Just accept it and say yes"

800
00:48:11,749 --> 00:48:13,241
-"Lovely!"
-"Can you get me crazy?"

801
00:48:13,441 --> 00:48:15,196
-"Lovely!"
-"Can you roll and rock me?"

802
00:48:15,396 --> 00:48:17,613
-"Lovely!"

00:48:19,025 --> 00:48:20,768
-"Lovely!"
-"Can you get me crazy?"

804
00:48:20,968 --> 00:48:22,962
-"Lovely!"
-"My beautiful baby"

805
00:48:23,162 --> 00:48:24,970
-"Lovely!"
-"By closing play me"

806
00:49:01,485 --> 00:49:04,897
"The thermometer is heated up"

807
00:49:05,136 --> 00:49:08,756
"Let to me to on this cooler"

808
00:49:08,956 --> 00:49:12,811
"The cooling in the body
making me turn into ice"

809
00:49:13,011 --> 00:49:16,486
"So, I will become a sweater to you"

810
00:49:16,686 --> 00:49:20,577
"Hey girl! Are you so shy?
Give me your burger cheek"

811
00:49:20,777 --> 00:49:23,997
"I only belong to you"

812
00:49:24,197 --> 00:49:27,872
"With the kiss you gave
me, my heart is..."

813
00:49:28,072 --> 00:49:31,931
"confused and got tensed"

814
00:49:32,131 --> 00:49:33,677
-"Lovely!"
-"Can you get me crazy?"

815
00:49:33,877 --> 00:49:35,767
-"Lovely!"
-"Can you roll and rock me?"

816
00:49:35,967 --> 00:49:39,351
-"Lovely!"
-"By closing play me"

817
00:49:39,551 --> 00:49:41,562
-"Lovely!"
-"Can you get me crazy?"

818
00:49:41,762 --> 00:49:43,595
-"Lovely!"
-"My beautiful baby"

819
00:49:43,795 --> 00:49:47,341
-"Lovely!"
-"By closing play me"

820
00:50:10,302 --> 00:50:14,210
"My naughty naughty lovely,
my heart is dancing, dancing"

821
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:18,155
"My naughty naughty lovely,
my heart is dancing, dancing"

822
00:50:25,716 --> 00:50:29,467
"You have planted an
atom bomb of love in me"

823
00:50:29,667 --> 00:50:33,063
"You have blasted your beauty in my heart"

824
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:37,150
"You are like a landmine to me"

825
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:40,759
"You don't the
destruction it causes in the body"

826
00:50:40,959 --> 00:50:44,991
"I'm your diamond set.
I'll become your perfect fit"

827
00:50:45,191 --> 00:50:48,630
"I have mortgaged my beauty to you"

828
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:52,404
"You're a beauty miss
world and naughty missile"

829
00:50:52,604 --> 00:50:56,254
"You became my new life style"

830
00:50:56,454 --> 00:50:58,159
-"Lovely!"
-"Can you get me crazy?"

831
00:50:58,359 --> 00:51:00,234
-"Lovely!"
-"Can you roll and rock me?"

832
00:51:00,434 --> 00:51:03,892
-"Lovely!"
-"By closing play me"

833
00:51:04,092 --> 00:51:06,238
-"Lovely!"
-"Can you get me crazy?"

834
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,793
-"Lovely!"
-"My beautiful baby"

835
00:51:07,993 --> 00:51:11,847
-"Lovely!"
-"By closing play me"

836
00:51:40,894 --> 00:51:43,881
-Dad, why are you here?
-Please sit, dear. Please!

837
00:51:44,137 --> 00:51:47,120
-Nayana, met my dad.
-Greetings, uncle.

838
00:51:47,721 --> 00:51:49,634
Dad, she is Nayana.

839
00:51:50,243 --> 00:51:51,814
Are you in love?

840
00:51:54,899 --> 00:51:56,625
-Can I talk to her?

841
00:51:56,918 --> 00:52:00,660
-Sure.
-If you leave us, I'll.

842
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,329
-Is it an interview?
-Yes!

843
00:52:02,529 --> 00:52:04,267
Okay. All the best, Nayana.

844
00:52:14,353 --> 00:52:15,347
Do you know about him?

845
00:52:16,033 --> 00:52:18,409
-He told me uncle.
-Oh great!

846
00:52:19,396 --> 00:52:21,438
Look, he leaves the house in the morning.

847
00:52:21,934 --> 00:52:25,472
And returns the home in the
night. He comes to my office for money.

848
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:31,055
No one knows about his life style,
his activities and hid friends.

849
00:52:31,452 --> 00:52:33,082
As a father, even I don't
know about his activities.

850
00:52:38,005 --> 00:52:41,154
You might have seen a father who
talks to a girl whom his son is loving.

851
00:52:41,766 --> 00:52:45,182
You might have seen fathers who warn that
girl that she isn’t correct to his son.

852
00:52:45,382 --> 00:52:46,737
But I'm different.

853
00:52:47,596 --> 00:52:49,870
My son isn't correct to you.

854
00:52:52,516 --> 00:52:56,942
He is in love with you and he is
roaming with you because he is useless.

855
00:52:57,597 --> 00:52:58,969
Try to understand.

856
00:52:59,413 --> 00:53:01,664
Love is fine until one
don't have responsibilities.

857
00:53:02,244 --> 00:53:03,887
He isn't eligible for marriage.

858
00:53:04,303 --> 00:53:05,732
Can I come?

859
00:53:07,331 --> 00:53:09,254
-This is the bill. Its Rs 1200.
-Okay. I'll pay.

860
00:53:09,554 --> 00:53:10,179
Stop, dear!

861
00:53:10,379 --> 00:53:11,910
Don't mind, dad. She will
pay. Why will you pay?

862
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:13,564
Son, you pay the bill.

863
00:53:14,045 --> 00:53:15,870
-Me?
-Pay the bill.

864
00:53:16,519 --> 00:53:19,355
-Okay, then. Do you accept cards here?
-Yes, sir.

865
00:53:19,555 --> 00:53:21,680
Is it? Do you own any cards?

866
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,552
What you have is mine, dad.
Give me you card. I'll pay it.

867
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:25,995
You pay the bill.

868
00:53:26,467 --> 00:53:28,046
That's what I meant.
Give me your card. I'll pay it.

869
00:53:28,847 --> 00:53:31,582
Okay I'll pay it.
But, when will you return the money?

870
00:53:33,017 --> 00:53:34,196
That's my dad sarcasm.

871
00:53:34,442 --> 00:53:37,244
You have seen fathers who gives money,
but have you seen who lends the money?

872
00:53:37,472 --> 00:53:38,270
When will you return the money?

873
00:53:38,563 --> 00:53:40,824
In a month? or two months? or in an year?

874
00:53:41,102 --> 00:53:42,377
What are you talking, dad?

875
00:53:42,698 --> 00:53:44,515
The person who can't take the
responsibility don't need to love.

876
00:53:44,875 --> 00:53:47,320
A useless guy don't need to show attitude.

877
00:53:52,285 --> 00:53:53,146
[deep exhale]

878
00:53:53,346 --> 00:53:56,311
One should look into their purse
if they want to do some expenses.

879
00:53:56,599 --> 00:53:57,884
It's not the others
purse they should look into.

880
00:53:58,631 --> 00:53:59,725
Listen to me, dear.

881
00:54:00,344 --> 00:54:03,137
I'm saying this with 30 years
experience in taking care of him.

882
00:54:04,703 --> 00:54:07,979
Love is fine until one
don't have responsibilities.

883
00:54:08,426 --> 00:54:09,967
He isn't eligible for marriage.

884
00:54:13,509 --> 00:54:14,775
Dad!

885
00:54:16,217 --> 00:54:17,694
You forgot to add some tip.

886
00:54:30,974 --> 00:54:32,293
What does your father think about us?

887
00:54:32,586 --> 00:54:35,519
He might think that he insulted
you. But, he insulted my love.

888
00:54:36,074 --> 00:54:39,551
Hey, He don't mean it.
He might be in some office tension.

889
00:54:39,751 --> 00:54:42,811
How can he insult his
son in front of a girl?

890
00:54:43,223 --> 00:54:45,445
Insult? I don't care all those things.

891
00:54:45,645 --> 00:54:47,578
These things are normal
between dad and a son.

892
00:54:47,778 --> 00:54:48,798
Just ignore it.

893
00:54:49,284 --> 00:54:52,584
No! I fought with the boss who
insulted me at the office.

894
00:54:53,755 --> 00:54:55,564
He is different person.
But here, it's my father.

895
00:54:55,764 --> 00:54:58,369
These things are normal in
a family. Just leave it.

896
00:54:58,569 --> 00:54:59,823
Is it a family?

897
00:55:00,023 --> 00:55:04,405
Is it great to insult the elder
son of the home in front of others?

898
00:55:04,785 --> 00:55:07,719
No need to stay there. Leave the
house. I'll take care of you.

899
00:55:07,919 --> 00:55:10,020
Do they think you
can't live with out them?

900
00:55:11,733 --> 00:55:13,873
Nayana don't heat up the issue. Leave it.

901
00:55:14,191 --> 00:55:16,806
Damn! I don't even like
to enter such house.

902
00:55:17,006 --> 00:55:19,158
-Is that a family? Crap!
-Hey!

903
00:55:20,556 --> 00:55:24,126
That is my family and he is my
dad. He has every right on me.

904
00:55:24,524 --> 00:55:27,695
he can scold me. He can hit me.
And I like to staying without eating.

905
00:55:28,035 --> 00:55:29,338
But I prefer to stay at home.

906
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:33,399
My family is my strength, honour and life.

907
00:55:34,445 --> 00:55:36,990
Leaving the relations is so
easy. it's like cutting a thread.

908
00:55:37,641 --> 00:55:40,875
Being together may be as
difficult as binding a thread.

909
00:55:42,232 --> 00:55:44,550
One who leaves the house fearing
those relations is always be alone.

910
00:55:46,137 --> 00:55:49,139
First learn to
respect and love the family.

911
00:55:51,065 --> 00:55:54,726
I don't like who just loves me.
I like the girl who loves my family too.

912
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:59,002
To gain her love, I'm even ready
to die and take birth again.

913
00:56:02,689 --> 00:56:05,207
You're asking me to leave my
parents who are everything to me.

914
00:56:05,407 --> 00:56:07,907
What is the guarantee that you won't
leave me in future if you're angry at me?

915
00:56:10,776 --> 00:56:12,905
If I can't get the girl
until I leave my family,

916
00:56:13,105 --> 00:56:14,211
I don't want such girl in my life.

917
00:56:14,698 --> 00:56:15,757
Good bye!

918
00:56:24,407 --> 00:56:27,565
Have you observed, dear?
Your son is same like you.

919
00:56:27,856 --> 00:56:30,457
You used to think that many people should
have food when we celebrate any occasion.

920
00:56:30,657 --> 00:56:33,171
Now, your son is doing the same.

921
00:56:33,371 --> 00:56:35,512
I think now your soul in resting in peace.

922
00:56:38,486 --> 00:56:41,291
All these my brain didn't get some ideas.

923
00:56:41,491 --> 00:56:44,471
I was confused about the
land which belongs to you.

924
00:56:44,671 --> 00:56:45,808
Now I got some idea.

925
00:56:46,008 --> 00:56:48,001
I want to donate it
to Kanaka Durga temple.

926
00:56:48,201 --> 00:56:50,434
Some one will have
some food in your name.

927
00:56:51,486 --> 00:56:54,175
My grand mother!
Do we own 10 acres of land?

928
00:56:54,375 --> 00:56:56,650
It's not 10 acres. It's only 4 acres.

929
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:58,812
I was just guessing. But it went right.

930
00:56:59,346 --> 00:57:02,230
Do we have 4 acres of land
beside Baba temple at 'Padamata'?

931
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:04,657
It's not in Padamata. It's in Benz circle.

932
00:57:05,292 --> 00:57:07,008
-In Benz circle?
-Yes!

933
00:57:07,208 --> 00:57:08,088
Come, let's discuss about this.

934
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:11,521
-Tell me what's your problem?
-Sit and listen to me.

935
00:57:12,761 --> 00:57:14,864
How did you manage to hide
this secret for 20 years?

936
00:57:15,492 --> 00:57:16,935
Do you know that it is
worth of crores now.

937
00:57:17,495 --> 00:57:18,752
You want to donate it to
Kanaka Durga temple?

938
00:57:19,257 --> 00:57:22,027
I just want to know. Do the
goddess is lack of money?

939
00:57:22,227 --> 00:57:24,011
If she want to bless us,
she will bless all of us.

940
00:57:24,211 --> 00:57:25,522
She don't require those 4 acres of land.

941
00:57:25,722 --> 00:57:27,458
-Please give it to me.
-No, I don't

942
00:57:27,658 --> 00:57:29,454
I don't want your permission
for that. I will take it myself.

943
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:30,989
Are those the documents
which are in your luggage bag?

944
00:57:31,189 --> 00:57:33,835
Why will I keep them in the luggage bag?

945
00:57:34,035 --> 00:57:37,939
It kept them safely in a plastic
cover and placed it under my pillow.

946
00:57:38,139 --> 00:57:40,113
Oh god! I'm so lucky today.

947
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:42,235
-Thank you grandma!
Thank you?

948
00:57:42,435 --> 00:57:45,432
-Hey, don't touch them. I'll kill you.
-It's okay!

949
00:57:45,841 --> 00:57:48,603
Hey, don't touch them. I'll kill you.

950
00:57:50,127 --> 00:57:51,645
Grandma!

951
00:57:53,812 --> 00:57:54,523
Grandma!

952
00:57:55,401 --> 00:57:56,014
Grandma!

953
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:59,176
If you try to own those properties
I'll torture you turning into a ghost.

954
00:57:59,531 --> 00:58:00,587
Grandma!

955
00:58:01,864 --> 00:58:03,830
-Mom, what happened mom.
-Mother in law, what happened to you.

956
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,088
-Mom! Mom!
-Grandma!

957
00:58:14,118 --> 00:58:16,112
She raised us with lot of love.

958
00:58:16,917 --> 00:58:20,814
She might be arrogant with her
words, but she was always good at heart.

959
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:26,202
By the way, what was she
saying you before she left us?

960
00:58:26,552 --> 00:58:30,215
That's...she told me to
take those 4 acres of land.

961
00:58:30,415 --> 00:58:34,566
Mother in law!
You love your grand son a lot.

962
00:58:38,503 --> 00:58:41,446
Murthy, sir. Grandma is still alive.

963
00:58:47,386 --> 00:58:49,561
Mother! Mother!

964
00:58:49,761 --> 00:58:53,518
Oh! No! My 4 acres of land. My documents.

965
00:58:53,718 --> 00:58:55,834
-What happened to my documents?
-Mother, what happened?

966
00:58:56,203 --> 00:58:57,800
-My 4 acres.
-What happened, mom?

967
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,434
Still you didn't understand? Your elder
son tried to steal these 4 acres from me.

968
00:59:06,037 --> 00:59:10,663
I was in hurry that he might
steal these. Then my slipped down.

969
00:59:10,868 --> 00:59:12,194
I'm happy that I'm alive.

970
00:59:12,878 --> 00:59:14,451
Didn't you ask him to take that land.

971
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:17,353
Why will I ask me to take
it. He was trying to steal it.

972
00:59:17,553 --> 00:59:19,803
I never give you these
documents. Even if I die.

973
00:59:21,243 --> 00:59:26,130
What's this, dear? Murthy sir's
family has a lot of respect in this area.

974
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:28,534
You tried to killed her just for the land?

975
00:59:28,734 --> 00:59:30,428
Now everyone is so angry at you.

976
00:59:30,655 --> 00:59:33,803
You took down all the
respect your family own. Oh god!

977
00:59:42,216 --> 00:59:44,347
Okay. I planned something.
But it didn’t go well. Leave it.

978
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:45,663
Leave it?

979
00:59:46,069 --> 00:59:49,058
-Planned to kill her?
-What are you talking, dad?

980
00:59:49,258 --> 00:59:51,575
Don't talk. Don't talk.

981
00:59:52,343 --> 00:59:55,076
I thought that my father's soul will
rest in peace if I donate some food.

982
00:59:55,443 --> 00:59:57,999
But giving birth to a son like
you never make his rest in peace.

983
00:59:58,273 --> 01:00:02,111
Why are talking so? I'. accepting my
mistake. Grandma, try to explain him.

984
01:00:02,394 --> 01:00:03,874
Why are you creating a scene here?

985
01:00:04,074 --> 01:00:05,411
Am I creating a scene here?

986
01:00:06,077 --> 01:00:10,120
I'm securing all the respect and honour
our family has from the past 50 years.

987
01:00:10,782 --> 01:00:12,967
You took down the entire
respect on to the road in one day.

988
01:00:13,167 --> 01:00:16,818
Nothing change now. Even tomorrow
everyone will greet me, if I go out.

989
01:00:17,018 --> 01:00:19,590
But, there used to be respect in
that. Now it has some sympathy.

990
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:21,743
Dad, why are so concerned
about the other people?

991
01:00:21,943 --> 01:00:23,474
Do they really care for you?

992
01:00:23,858 --> 01:00:27,448
Donate your assets as you like. It's
your wish. I'll sign all the documents.

993
01:00:28,627 --> 01:00:31,193
Dad, it's my mistake.
Please forgive me. I never repeat this.

994
01:00:31,579 --> 01:00:33,452
-Mom, I'm hungry. Serve me some food.
-Don't serve him, Lakshmi.

995
01:00:33,801 --> 01:00:36,392
-He's just joking. Come, mom.
-Don't serve him, Lakshmi.

996
01:00:37,047 --> 01:00:38,772
Can't serve myself if you don't?

997
01:00:40,495 --> 01:00:43,974
Everyone can eat the food prepared for the
grand father's ceremony. But, I'm not.

998
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:47,038
You should not eat this.

999
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:53,294
You're not worth enough to taste
the food offered to your grand father.

1000
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:55,712
Listen to me carefully.

1001
01:00:56,149 --> 01:00:59,345
From now, you will not even a
grain of rice from this house.

1002
01:00:59,545 --> 01:01:00,467
What are you talking?

1003
01:01:00,667 --> 01:01:01,544
That's it.

1004
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:06,025
Dad, why are making this
bigger? What was my mistake?

1005
01:01:06,646 --> 01:01:09,195
Doesn't the grandfather's
property belong to grand son?

1006
01:01:10,036 --> 01:01:11,115
Don't we have a right on that?

1007
01:01:11,315 --> 01:01:12,459
Tell me!

1008
01:01:12,659 --> 01:01:14,392
It's all over and again
you are talking the same.

1009
01:01:14,654 --> 01:01:16,367
Why are talking about your rights?

1010
01:01:17,158 --> 01:01:19,145
You should be my son first,
to become a grand son to grand father.

1011
01:01:19,389 --> 01:01:21,353
And I should say that but not you feel it.

1012
01:01:21,616 --> 01:01:22,684
Now I'm telling it.

1013
01:01:23,587 --> 01:01:25,918
The guy who took off my
respect is not my son.

1014
01:01:26,309 --> 01:01:27,780
You're not my son.

1015
01:01:29,196 --> 01:01:30,674
He is my elder son.

1016
01:01:34,398 --> 01:01:35,737
Get out! Get out of the house.

1017
01:01:35,937 --> 01:01:39,343
Why should I?
This is family and I'm your son.

1018
01:01:39,543 --> 01:01:40,511
I don't go leaving you all.

1019
01:01:40,711 --> 01:01:42,136
Damn! Stop it.

1020
01:01:42,645 --> 01:01:46,594
"I like this family. I love
you a lot. I don't go anywhere"

1021
01:01:46,794 --> 01:01:50,904
"I love you a lot."
I'm tired of hearing all those words.

1022
01:01:51,104 --> 01:01:53,228
If you love this family
so much, what have you done to it?

1023
01:01:53,428 --> 01:01:54,438
Tell me what have you done?

1024
01:01:54,848 --> 01:01:56,665
Are you useful to
anyone of us in this house?

1025
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,037
Always talking about love.

1026
01:01:58,317 --> 01:01:59,849
What we do is called love.

1027
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:02,721
We love you even if you don't have a good
education like her and a job like him.

1028
01:02:02,921 --> 01:02:07,605
We even love you if you don't earn
like me and we're bearing your torture.

1029
01:02:07,894 --> 01:02:08,829
That is the actual love.

1030
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:11,104
That is the love of the
family. What you said is not love.

1031
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:13,545
The tree in front of our
house is far better than you.

1032
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:14,989
I planted it when you were born.

1033
01:02:15,336 --> 01:02:17,307
Now after growing up it
is producing some fruits.

1034
01:02:17,761 --> 01:02:20,014
It will give. Because it was
watered three times a day.

1035
01:02:20,382 --> 01:02:22,724
Medicines were sprayed for the
strength. A stick was planted for support.

1036
01:02:22,924 --> 01:02:24,704
Grandma was kept as a security
to avoid the tree from insects.

1037
01:02:24,904 --> 01:02:25,612
There was some investment.

1038
01:02:25,812 --> 01:02:27,815
Then it give some yield.
Did you invest on me?

1039
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:30,998
I told that I want to start a construction
business. Did you listen it? No!

1040
01:02:31,198 --> 01:02:32,254
What would you have
achieved if you started it.

1041
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,480
Didn't you lose the job after I
managed to get you a job there?

1042
01:02:36,605 --> 01:02:39,476
How many times should I explain,
dad? I can't live without you all.

1043
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:42,295
I don't like to live a life where I
earn money and I send you half of it.

1044
01:02:42,495 --> 01:02:44,565
And I can't live alone
happily with the rest of the amount.

1045
01:02:46,189 --> 01:02:50,094
If I have to do so,
I prefer to stay jobless at home.

1046
01:02:50,373 --> 01:02:51,118
Great!

1047
01:02:51,318 --> 01:02:53,654
One will be always ready to move
around the world for the family.

1048
01:02:53,854 --> 01:02:55,096
But you're not even ready
to move out of the house.

1049
01:02:55,296 --> 01:02:56,524
More over you say that
you love your family.

1050
01:02:56,724 --> 01:02:58,190
Why are you acting so?

1051
01:03:00,812 --> 01:03:03,798
You know you don't
work and you can't.

1052
01:03:04,278 --> 01:03:06,978
Because you got used to depend on us.

1053
01:03:09,089 --> 01:03:11,097
And you name it as family and love.

1054
01:03:11,701 --> 01:03:14,138
You're a lie and
your love is a lie.

1055
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:18,188
To explain in one word,

1056
01:03:18,546 --> 01:03:19,886
it is not the love you have.

1057
01:03:20,126 --> 01:03:21,096
It's your need.

1058
01:03:22,328 --> 01:03:23,593
This is not your house.

1059
01:03:24,336 --> 01:03:27,289
This is hotel which serves you
food with you charging a bill.

1060
01:03:28,818 --> 01:03:30,842
This is a lodge which serves
you when you want to sleep.

1061
01:03:32,463 --> 01:03:33,867
We are not a family to you.

1062
01:03:34,359 --> 01:03:37,378
We are ATM machines which
provide money when ever you require.

1063
01:03:37,804 --> 01:03:40,466
Wow! What kind of a life is yours?

1064
01:03:41,419 --> 01:03:42,961
Dad, I never thought in that way.

1065
01:03:43,581 --> 01:03:45,001
I always thought you're all my family.

1066
01:03:45,201 --> 01:03:46,534
-Get out!
-Dad, listen to me.

1067
01:03:46,734 --> 01:03:47,842
Get out of the house!

1068
01:03:48,042 --> 01:03:49,750
-Mom, stop him.
-Get out!

1069
01:03:51,273 --> 01:03:53,009
Mom, try to stop him.

1070
01:03:54,056 --> 01:03:55,468
Get out!

1071
01:04:10,211 --> 01:04:13,629
[telephone ringing]

1072
01:04:14,072 --> 01:04:15,143
It may be from our son.

1073
01:04:15,804 --> 01:04:17,283
[telephone ringing]

1074
01:04:17,483 --> 01:04:18,907
He don't listen to me.

1075
01:04:19,909 --> 01:04:22,249
-How many times should I tell you...
-Murthy, sir!

1076
01:04:27,157 --> 01:04:31,094
"Law. Justice. Belief"
Didn't you find any of these, murthy sir?

1077
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:34,956
I'm coming.

1078
01:04:36,596 --> 01:04:39,834
Please sign the document
and send me with respect.

1079
01:04:40,089 --> 01:04:43,632
Don't provoke my ego. Okay?

1080
01:04:47,953 --> 01:04:49,161
What happened?

1081
01:04:49,959 --> 01:04:51,025
Who was that on the phone?

1082
01:04:51,529 --> 01:04:52,753
Is our son fine?

1083
01:04:53,012 --> 01:04:54,206
Who was that on the phone?

1084
01:04:54,492 --> 01:04:55,977
I'm observing you from a month.

1085
01:04:56,177 --> 01:04:59,342
You're feeling so scared and
tensed when you receive a phone.

1086
01:04:59,542 --> 01:05:02,502
Last time, you were so angry
when I asked about house repair.

1087
01:05:02,702 --> 01:05:05,288
-What happened to you?
-What should I explain, mom?

1088
01:05:06,512 --> 01:05:09,611
I'm feared that I
may loose this house.

1089
01:05:09,811 --> 01:05:10,972
What happened?

1090
01:05:13,148 --> 01:05:14,678
Kasi!

1091
01:05:16,959 --> 01:05:19,102
Kasi wants to own our house.

1092
01:05:21,803 --> 01:05:24,441
-I liked your house, murthy sir.
-I'm not selling my house.

1093
01:05:24,776 --> 01:05:26,089
I'm not here to buy it.

1094
01:05:27,372 --> 01:05:30,299
If Kasi likes a house, he
occupies it. he never buy it.

1095
01:05:31,933 --> 01:05:33,446
He gave a time of one month.

1096
01:05:34,707 --> 01:05:36,446
I tried a lot to get justice.

1097
01:05:37,509 --> 01:05:41,715
I've approached police, lawyers,
societies, MLA's and many officials.

1098
01:05:42,693 --> 01:05:45,101
But they are cared of
Kasi and they were helpless.

1099
01:05:47,115 --> 01:05:48,839
The deadline ends in an hour.

1100
01:05:50,497 --> 01:05:51,501
How will be here after that.

1101
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:10,002
-Drag them out!
-Guys, come on.

1102
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:13,191
What are you seeing? Come with me.

1103
01:06:13,579 --> 01:06:14,661
Hey, stop!

1104
01:06:18,978 --> 01:06:21,855
-Please leave him!
-Leave him.

1105
01:06:23,065 --> 01:06:27,748
I expected you will handover the signed
documents by the time I reach you.

1106
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:29,172
But it didn't happen.

1107
01:06:30,044 --> 01:06:31,662
Now, my ego got hurt.

1108
01:06:32,835 --> 01:06:35,822
So...I dragged you out of the house.

1109
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:37,803
Sign the documents.

1110
01:06:38,809 --> 01:06:40,716
-I don't.
-Guys, make him do it.

1111
01:06:41,767 --> 01:06:43,197
-Dad!
-Sign it.

1112
01:06:43,475 --> 01:06:44,662
Son!

1113
01:06:46,178 --> 01:06:49,001
-Sir, please leave him.
-Mother-in-law!

1114
01:06:49,201 --> 01:06:50,854
Dad!

1115
01:06:51,054 --> 01:06:53,373
Dad!

1116
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:56,160
They are hurting your family, Murthy.

1117
01:06:57,575 --> 01:06:58,621
Sign the documents.

1118
01:06:58,930 --> 01:07:01,119
I won't let you put your hand on my house.

1119
01:07:02,444 --> 01:07:04,196
I don't happen when I'm alive.

1120
01:07:08,697 --> 01:07:10,587
Leave me! Leave!

1121
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:14,721
Son, look at him.
Please go and save your father.

1122
01:07:15,917 --> 01:07:18,635
Please go and save your father.

1123
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:25,361
[police siren wailing]

1124
01:07:30,285 --> 01:07:34,777
Sir, I beg you. Please
save my husband. I beg you.

1125
01:07:35,235 --> 01:07:38,557
I beg you, sir. Please save my husband.

1126
01:07:47,425 --> 01:07:49,397
Come on! Come!

1127
01:07:51,247 --> 01:07:53,550
-I beg you, sir.
-Lakshmi, don't do that.

1128
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:55,149
No, Lakshmi!

1129
01:08:03,013 --> 01:08:07,731
Look at the people who
are waiting to see you die.

1130
01:08:08,597 --> 01:08:11,516
Look at your wife who is begging for help.

1131
01:08:11,930 --> 01:08:14,487
No one will help you!

1132
01:08:14,972 --> 01:08:16,470
Why about others?

1133
01:08:17,987 --> 01:08:20,926
Look at your son. He is so scared.

1134
01:08:21,126 --> 01:08:25,669
While everyone understood me,
why are you unable to get this?

1135
01:08:25,999 --> 01:08:28,531
Why are you still so stubborn?

1136
01:08:29,169 --> 01:08:33,815
No one is born in Bezawada
city, to turn against me.

1137
01:08:34,015 --> 01:08:36,152
Leave me! Leave!

1138
01:08:36,352 --> 01:08:38,705
Son, give me you phone. Give me.

1139
01:08:43,312 --> 01:08:44,822
Son!

1140
01:08:45,022 --> 01:08:46,228
Look at me carefully.

1141
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,838
If Kasi like anything, just give it him.

1142
01:08:49,410 --> 01:08:51,895
If you deny to do that, you will be dead.

1143
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:53,593
How many times should I say you?

1144
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:58,580
How may times should I warn
you not to provoke my ego.

1145
01:09:07,402 --> 01:09:08,401
Father!

1146
01:09:52,239 --> 01:09:54,667
Hit that idiot! Hit him hard.

1147
01:09:57,166 --> 01:09:58,111
Hey!

1148
01:09:59,467 --> 01:10:01,664
How dare you hit my father?

1149
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:02,783
No, Siva!

1150
01:10:03,261 --> 01:10:04,647
You know nothing about them.

1151
01:10:05,109 --> 01:10:06,301
Yes, I don't know father.

1152
01:10:07,522 --> 01:10:10,759
I don't know how to study like sister.
I don't hoe to do a job like my brother.

1153
01:10:10,959 --> 01:10:12,382
I don't know how to earn like you.

1154
01:10:12,656 --> 01:10:15,362
I don't know to feel
responsible like you.

1155
01:10:15,952 --> 01:10:17,872
But I know one thing father.

1156
01:10:18,627 --> 01:10:23,811
If anyone lays hands on my
father, I know how to break it.

1157
01:10:38,553 --> 01:10:42,046
You can sold me. You can hit me. And I
even stay, if you don't serve me food.

1158
01:10:42,627 --> 01:10:44,356
But I can't stay without you.

1159
01:10:44,973 --> 01:10:47,091
It is not me 'need'. It is my love.

1160
01:11:06,477 --> 01:11:09,260
My love is not a lie. It's true.

1161
01:11:23,652 --> 01:11:25,185
You...

1162
01:11:26,646 --> 01:11:28,308
you know whom you are fighting with?

1163
01:11:28,594 --> 01:11:31,180
Kasi! Kasi! Kasi!

1164
01:11:38,597 --> 01:11:41,219
Look at him carefully.

1165
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,896
He is my father.

1166
01:11:43,416 --> 01:11:44,379
And that is my family.

1167
01:11:44,794 --> 01:11:48,399
You might kill your own
family for assets and properties.

1168
01:11:48,599 --> 01:11:50,233
But my family is an asset to me.

1169
01:11:50,677 --> 01:11:55,729
Be it Kasi or anyone, I will tear
them apart who tries to touch them.

1170
01:11:58,834 --> 01:12:03,438
Heard that you're so confident about no
one can turn against you in this city.

1171
01:12:04,081 --> 01:12:08,741
But you must have understood this when the
Diwali was celebrated which you denied.

1172
01:12:08,941 --> 01:12:11,179
You must have understood that there is
man in this city to turn against you.

1173
01:12:43,363 --> 01:12:44,316
Listen!

1174
01:12:44,708 --> 01:12:47,382
This is my father's house
which means it is my house.

1175
01:12:48,497 --> 01:12:53,453
If anyone tries to dig it with a crow
bar, I will insert that in their heart.

1176
01:13:10,086 --> 01:13:14,272
Sir! I don’t know about the
issue, but I'm very happy sir.

1177
01:13:14,472 --> 01:13:15,200
What are you talking about?

1178
01:13:15,444 --> 01:13:16,857
It's about your elder son, sir.

1179
01:13:17,344 --> 01:13:19,532
The people who blamed him all these days

1180
01:13:19,732 --> 01:13:23,144
are praising him for the thing he did.

1181
01:13:23,344 --> 01:13:24,435
Really it's very great sir.

1182
01:13:24,635 --> 01:13:26,518
I'm very happy to listen this.

1183
01:13:26,718 --> 01:13:28,202
Super, sir. Really super, sir.

1184
01:13:29,976 --> 01:13:32,299
[mobile phone ringing]

1185
01:13:34,007 --> 01:13:37,428
-Dad!
-Are you busy? Can I speak to you?

1186
01:13:37,795 --> 01:13:38,806
Please tell em dad.

1187
01:13:39,006 --> 01:13:40,190
Come to my office once.

1188
01:13:45,603 --> 01:13:46,931
Just stop! Don't get down.

1189
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:03,347
Let's go!

1190
01:14:05,124 --> 01:14:06,569
When did buy this bike?

1191
01:14:06,797 --> 01:14:08,632
No, I don't own a bike.
This is my friend's bike.

1192
01:14:13,328 --> 01:14:14,277
Come! Let's buy a bike.

1193
01:14:14,563 --> 01:14:16,673
It's required dad.
I can manage without it.

1194
01:14:16,873 --> 01:14:20,637
I don't like Murthy's son
asking his friend for a bike.

1195
01:14:20,837 --> 01:14:22,182
It shouldn't happen. Come!

1196
01:14:24,484 --> 01:14:26,403
-Hi, Kareem!
-Hello, sir.

1197
01:14:26,603 --> 01:14:27,158
He is my son.

1198
01:14:27,358 --> 01:14:28,391
-Greetings, sir.
-Greetings.

1199
01:14:28,591 --> 01:14:30,323
I want to buy him a
bike. What's the cost of it?

1200
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:31,755
It's Rs 80,000, sir.

1201
01:14:32,076 --> 01:14:34,351
Avail me some discount from the
company's offers. Adjust the price.

1202
01:14:34,551 --> 01:14:35,563
You select the bike.

1203
01:14:35,763 --> 01:14:37,331
Hey stop the bike!

1204
01:14:39,736 --> 01:14:40,648
Come here!

1205
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:42,258
Give me a plate.

1206
01:14:46,884 --> 01:14:49,164
Is it good? You want one more?

1207
01:14:56,144 --> 01:14:57,421
Give me the sugar candy.

1208
01:14:58,069 --> 01:14:59,907
No dad! I'm not kid to eat it.

1209
01:15:00,107 --> 01:15:04,143
You used to ask when you were in
1st standard. But I didn't buy you.

1210
01:15:04,343 --> 01:15:06,202
It don't look good. It
is an children food.

1211
01:15:06,402 --> 01:15:08,984
I'm buying you and you're eating it.

1212
01:15:09,184 --> 01:15:10,071
Give me two candies.

1213
01:15:20,570 --> 01:15:21,921
Son!

1214
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:23,673
When you were born...

1215
01:15:24,201 --> 01:15:29,268
I had a lot of thoughts
about you and your life and education.

1216
01:15:29,558 --> 01:15:31,123
I dreamed a lot about that.

1217
01:15:32,376 --> 01:15:36,621
But, when you weren't like that, I was
very angry. I scolded you. I beat you.

1218
01:15:37,687 --> 01:15:39,362
Finally, I sent you out of the house.

1219
01:15:40,478 --> 01:15:41,627
I did a mistake.

1220
01:15:42,655 --> 01:15:45,711
You should dream about your life,
but I dreamed a lot about it.

1221
01:15:46,321 --> 01:15:47,368
I'm sorry.

1222
01:15:47,614 --> 01:15:49,035
You shouldn't say me sorry, dad.

1223
01:15:50,473 --> 01:15:53,716
Parents shouldn't force their
dreams on their children.

1224
01:15:54,244 --> 01:15:56,353
They should try to make
their children dreams happy.

1225
01:15:57,273 --> 01:15:59,463
How I did miss this small logic?

1226
01:16:04,426 --> 01:16:06,853
Hey! Hello!

1227
01:16:07,208 --> 01:16:09,717
I went out with my son.
Tell me, what's the matter?

1228
01:16:10,989 --> 01:16:13,932
Was it your elder son, who bet Kasi?

1229
01:16:14,259 --> 01:16:15,939
It's my personal issue. Leave it.

1230
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,287
How can we leave it easily?

1231
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:21,314
It's normal to see a son turning
against a person who hit his father.

1232
01:16:21,712 --> 01:16:23,251
But here he hit a big guy named Kasi.

1233
01:16:23,787 --> 01:16:25,496
But he did a small mistake.

1234
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:28,271
What was that?

1235
01:16:29,605 --> 01:16:30,671
He forgot about me.

1236
01:16:33,901 --> 01:16:36,526
Dangerous Kasi has a brother too.

1237
01:16:36,918 --> 01:16:38,911
He will get angry if
anyone hits his brother.

1238
01:16:39,111 --> 01:16:40,634
He gets provoked if he gets angry.

1239
01:16:40,834 --> 01:16:44,877
Your son forgot that he will kill
other person if he is provoked.

1240
01:16:48,435 --> 01:16:50,280
Don't get scared. I won't kill you.

1241
01:16:50,769 --> 01:16:54,502
This eyes saw the fall of Kasi.
it should again witness his raise.

1242
01:16:54,861 --> 01:16:56,852
But your son is finished.

1243
01:17:11,792 --> 01:17:13,864
Hey! Who's that?

1244
01:17:19,946 --> 01:17:21,718
I think you're Rakesh, Right?

1245
01:17:23,819 --> 01:17:25,780
Heard that some one beat Kasi.

1246
01:17:27,373 --> 01:17:28,672
Will Kasi stay quiet?

1247
01:17:28,872 --> 01:17:31,461
Leave about Kasi, will you keep
calm, if anyone beat your brother?

1248
01:17:31,661 --> 01:17:33,090
Won't you find him and kill him?

1249
01:17:33,370 --> 01:17:34,477
I thought you would do so.

1250
01:17:34,770 --> 01:17:38,720
But what did you did?
You became useless and went to father...

1251
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,786
and warned him with a pen on his throat.

1252
01:17:46,969 --> 01:17:47,995
Hey!

1253
01:17:48,505 --> 01:17:52,222
You may be Rakesh and your brother may
be Kasi and the city may be scared of you.

1254
01:17:52,715 --> 01:17:56,125
But, you are dealing with
Siva. Siva! You rascal!

1255
01:17:56,325 --> 01:17:59,552
If I my hand gets angry,
your body will get an earth quake.

1256
01:17:59,752 --> 01:18:02,238
Rector scale will be too high.

1257
01:19:16,679 --> 01:19:18,635
-You!
-Quiet!

1258
01:19:21,885 --> 01:19:26,167
Kasi, you went after my
father and I came after you.

1259
01:19:26,611 --> 01:19:27,976
It is balanced now.

1260
01:19:28,526 --> 01:19:31,330
I'll forget about this
and you too forget this.

1261
01:19:32,690 --> 01:19:35,710
Your brother is on a plan of killing me.

1262
01:19:37,761 --> 01:19:38,931
Look!

1263
01:19:39,773 --> 01:19:44,552
I wouldn't have beat you if I was a
person who thinks about the consequences.

1264
01:19:45,652 --> 01:19:48,155
I don't have such fears.

1265
01:19:49,169 --> 01:19:51,478
Generally, I don't beat anyone.

1266
01:19:52,269 --> 01:19:53,455
But if I do,

1267
01:19:53,954 --> 01:19:58,842
I'll make sure that hand will land on
the body and blood is out of the body.

1268
01:19:59,949 --> 01:20:00,833
Leave it.

1269
01:20:01,033 --> 01:20:02,286
Why should we leave it?

1270
01:20:02,486 --> 01:20:04,238
What do you want? What do you want?

1271
01:20:04,438 --> 01:20:05,278
No! No!

1272
01:20:05,478 --> 01:20:08,278
The knife which cuts the
fruits will also cut the throat.

1273
01:20:08,478 --> 01:20:10,591
-Cut! Cut!
-Cut or compromise?

1274
01:20:10,791 --> 01:20:11,812
Compromise?

1275
01:20:12,012 --> 01:20:13,976
-Louder!
-Compromise?

1276
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:15,311
Learn from him.

1277
01:20:15,843 --> 01:20:16,747
You're saved.

1278
01:20:17,853 --> 01:20:21,477
I wish you a speedy recovery
and normal lifer after this.

1279
01:20:21,801 --> 01:20:22,832
Bye!

1280
01:20:23,950 --> 01:20:25,094
By the way...

1281
01:20:25,719 --> 01:20:29,744
my family which was out tot track for
30 years is perfect now because of you.

1282
01:20:29,944 --> 01:20:31,488
Thank you so much, brother. Good bye!

1283
01:20:46,195 --> 01:20:48,208
Dad! problem is solved.

1284
01:20:48,651 --> 01:20:50,655
He never dares to face us again.

1285
01:20:50,855 --> 01:20:51,725
Compromise.

1286
01:20:53,034 --> 01:20:54,034
How did he agree for it?

1287
01:20:54,234 --> 01:20:56,801
I explain him in his style.
He never look at us again.

1288
01:20:59,075 --> 01:21:00,615
I'm so happy now.

1289
01:21:00,815 --> 01:21:01,739
By the way...

1290
01:21:02,063 --> 01:21:04,261
you fought with people who
shouldn't come to our house.

1291
01:21:04,696 --> 01:21:06,636
-What about the one who should come?
-Who's that?

1292
01:21:06,910 --> 01:21:07,898
Daughter-in-law.

1293
01:21:08,509 --> 01:21:10,220
Search for a good
alliance. I will marry her.

1294
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:11,138
Hey!

1295
01:21:11,862 --> 01:21:14,217
Hey! Wait! Stop there.

1296
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:15,923
What about that girl?

1297
01:21:16,356 --> 01:21:19,208
You did all the damage and now
you're asking about her?

1298
01:21:19,906 --> 01:21:21,052
What did I do?

1299
01:21:21,252 --> 01:21:25,610
You scolded me that I'm not eligible
and I can't pay the bill and I'm useless.

1300
01:21:25,810 --> 01:21:26,539
That was back then...

1301
01:21:26,816 --> 01:21:30,443
She asked me to leave this house
saying that this house don't deserve me.

1302
01:21:30,643 --> 01:21:34,028
I was angry on her.
I scolded her and I left her that day.

1303
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:35,613
You did a mistake.

1304
01:21:36,111 --> 01:21:40,449
When all of us didn't understand
you. She was the one was with you.

1305
01:21:40,758 --> 01:21:44,434
Do you know she was the one who
felt sad when I was scolding you.

1306
01:21:44,789 --> 01:21:46,611
She loved you a lot.

1307
01:21:47,314 --> 01:21:52,156
She became a part of this
family when she started loving you.

1308
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,232
You care for your family a lot
and how did you leave her?

1309
01:21:57,869 --> 01:22:00,679
I don't care about what happened.

1310
01:22:00,927 --> 01:22:04,499
We want our daughter-in-laws
and you're getting her. That's it.

1311
01:22:05,216 --> 01:22:07,308
If I go now, I'll be done.
She will see my end.

1312
01:22:07,761 --> 01:22:10,448
It's your job. I don't care about
that. All I need is that girl.

1313
01:22:10,787 --> 01:22:12,095
-Come and serve me food.
-Yes!

1314
01:22:12,295 --> 01:22:13,459
It's not that dad...

1315
01:22:15,088 --> 01:22:15,500
-Stop!
-What?

1316
01:22:15,656 --> 01:22:16,856
Is she really so beautiful?

1317
01:22:17,056 --> 01:22:20,667
Does you pair look good like
me and your grandfather?

1318
01:22:20,867 --> 01:22:22,877
-It's more than that.
-Oh!

1319
01:22:23,114 --> 01:22:25,832
Why are proving your sadism and
remembering about her beauty?

1320
01:22:26,032 --> 01:22:27,012
What's the matter?

1321
01:22:27,893 --> 01:22:30,781
Her beauty and her glow!

1322
01:22:58,414 --> 01:23:03,051
"Your sharp looks cuts down the my smile"

1323
01:23:03,251 --> 01:23:07,905
"My heart got your sweet love bite"

1324
01:23:08,105 --> 01:23:12,448
"You made me drown in your love"

1325
01:23:12,648 --> 01:23:17,337
"My heart is filled
with you in every inch"

1326
01:23:17,537 --> 01:23:22,030
"Your looks got me a lovely heart attack"

1327
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:27,039
"You made me to get on love track, fully"

1328
01:23:27,239 --> 01:23:31,503
"You made me to get on love track, fully"

1329
01:23:31,703 --> 01:23:36,175
"You killed me with a love bite"

1330
01:23:36,549 --> 01:23:41,082
"Your sharp looks cuts down the my smile"

1331
01:23:41,282 --> 01:23:46,197
"My heart got your sweet love bite"

1332
01:24:14,954 --> 01:24:19,435
"By the time sun rises and
the light for the eyes"

1333
01:24:19,635 --> 01:24:23,831
"You emit your glow as lightening to me"

1334
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:28,701
"By the time moon
raises and star struck hard"

1335
01:24:28,901 --> 01:24:33,383
"You will shower your
smile which is a cool breeze"

1336
01:24:33,583 --> 01:24:38,328
"I'm spending a lot of
days in your memories"

1337
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:43,345
"Without you I'm always incomplete"

1338
01:24:43,545 --> 01:24:47,530
"Your looks got me a lovely heart attack"

1339
01:24:47,730 --> 01:24:52,349
"You made me to get on love track, fully"

1340
01:24:52,549 --> 01:24:57,030
"Your looks got me a lovely heart attack"

1341
01:24:57,230 --> 01:25:01,623
"You killed me with a love bite"

1342
01:25:02,014 --> 01:25:06,499
"Your sharp looks cuts down the my smile"

1343
01:25:06,699 --> 01:25:11,459
"My heart got your sweet love bite"

1344
01:25:40,433 --> 01:25:44,642
"Let my foot marks cover your
foot marks like an umbrella"

1345
01:25:45,031 --> 01:25:49,529
"I'm always with you like your shadow"

1346
01:25:49,729 --> 01:25:54,288
"Let my eye brows turn
into wings and fly my eyes"

1347
01:25:54,488 --> 01:25:59,145
"And I'll search for your
presence every second"

1348
01:25:59,345 --> 01:26:03,883
"My life was a mess before meeting you"

1349
01:26:04,083 --> 01:26:08,561
"I'm eager to lead a life
with you. Come on handsome"

1350
01:26:08,817 --> 01:26:13,078
"Your looks got me a lovely heart attack"

1351
01:26:13,278 --> 01:26:17,698
"You made me to get on love track, fully"

1352
01:26:18,107 --> 01:26:22,572
"Your looks got me a lovely heart attack"

1353
01:26:22,772 --> 01:26:27,238
"You killed me with a love bite"

1354
01:26:36,881 --> 01:26:37,658
Hello!

1355

-I know. Just move.

1356
01:26:41,806 --> 01:26:43,219

1357
01:26:45,693 --> 01:26:47,017
Who are you? What do you want?

1358
01:26:47,730 --> 01:26:49,343
-Big egoist!
-What?

1359
01:26:49,957 --> 01:26:51,833
Nothing! I came to ask about my matter.

1360
01:26:52,033 --> 01:26:53,663
What's the matter. it's nothing.

1361
01:26:53,863 --> 01:26:54,759
We don't each other.

1362
01:26:54,959 --> 01:26:57,114
You said that you will leave
me too if you get angry.

1363
01:26:57,601 --> 01:27:00,727
Now, I'm angry and I'm leaving you.

1364
01:27:00,927 --> 01:27:03,752
You have your family.
Go and leave with them. Bye!

1365
01:27:03,952 --> 01:27:05,969
it's not that. Listen to me.

1366
01:27:06,169 --> 01:27:08,129
What? Tell me?

1367
01:27:08,505 --> 01:27:11,154
Do the men speak as they
like when they are in love?

1368
01:27:11,354 --> 01:27:12,502
Don't compare me with all other men.

1369
01:27:13,078 --> 01:27:14,006
What will you do if I compare?

1370
01:27:14,317 --> 01:27:17,004
You're here to beg me. Not to irritate me.

1371
01:27:17,201 --> 01:27:18,738
-What?
-What?

1372
01:27:19,048 --> 01:27:20,930
Are you only one who has a
family. Don't have a family?

1373
01:27:21,229 --> 01:27:23,000
-Then why are you not staying with them?
-It's my wish.

1374
01:27:23,358 --> 01:27:25,585
I don't like some one
demanding or commanding me.

1375
01:27:25,785 --> 01:27:27,480
I don't like male domination.

1376
01:27:27,890 --> 01:27:30,223
That's the reason, listen
to me. I don't like you.

1377
01:27:30,442 --> 01:27:33,023
I don't marry you if
beg me and plead me.

1378
01:27:33,313 --> 01:27:38,038
We are done. I'll marry
anyone idiot except you.

1379
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:41,248
But I don't marry the guy
who rejected me on my face.

1380
01:27:41,495 --> 01:27:43,067
No other will be a better
choice other than me.

1381
01:27:43,267 --> 01:27:44,788
If no one is there, I'll make one.

1382
01:27:44,988 --> 01:27:46,224
-What do I lack?
-Then go ahead.

1383
01:27:46,586 --> 01:27:49,401
-I'll find.
-Go ahead. We will also enjoy it.

1384
01:27:49,601 --> 01:27:51,295
I'll find a better choice on the spot.

1385
01:27:53,915 --> 01:27:55,609
-See the line, there.
-Okay.

1386
01:27:55,850 --> 01:27:58,467
The first person to cross
the line will marry me.

1387
01:27:58,667 --> 01:28:01,203
-If it is a girl?
-I'll marry her. Any problem?

1388
01:28:02,419 --> 01:28:05,119

Is it P or F in the name?

1410
01:29:32,915 --> 01:29:34,186
It's Deefak Raj, I say.

1411
01:29:34,495 --> 01:29:35,770
Oh! I think he can't spell 'P'.

1412

01:29:49,581 --> 01:29:51,593
Nayana this is too much.

1417
01:29:51,793 --> 01:29:53,081
-This old man...
-Hey!

1418
01:29:54,015 --> 01:29:55,344
Don't loose your tongue.

1419
01:29:56,295 --> 01:29:57,887
It's not about young or old.

1420
01:29:58,087 --> 01:29:59,924
--Love don't care about old age
-Is it?.

1421
01:30:00,133 --> 01:30:02,276
-It cares about heart. That's it.
-Is it?

1422
01:30:02,783 --> 01:30:04,373
I have a small doubt, Deefak Raj.

1423
01:30:04,573 --> 01:30:05,482
What is that?

1424
01:30:05,862 --> 01:30:08,645
Is your trouser torn or you
you wore shot as a trouser?

1425
01:30:08,845 --> 01:30:10,551
It is unnecessary matter to you.

1426
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,581
Nayan, who is this guy?

1427
01:30:12,857 --> 01:30:14,654
He is my friend.

1428
01:30:14,881 --> 01:30:16,056
-Friend!
-Yes.

1429
01:30:16,256 --> 01:30:17,220
-Hey mister.
-Yes!

1430
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:19,535
You're her friend and
you be in your limits.

1431
01:30:19,961 --> 01:30:21,342
Don't overact.

1432
01:30:21,542 --> 01:30:23,653
You head will be broken into parts.

1433
01:30:23,961 --> 01:30:25,442
What will you break?

1434
01:30:25,739 --> 01:30:27,336
You head will be broken into parts.

1435
01:30:27,536 --> 01:30:28,602
Let's move.

1436
01:30:30,477 --> 01:30:31,905
Nayana!

1437
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:39,353
Why did you become so lean?

1438
01:30:39,553 --> 01:30:40,558
What is this dear?

1439
01:30:40,758 --> 01:30:44,116
We are the owners of 500 acres of land.
We are treated as respectful people.

1440
01:30:44,316 --> 01:30:46,917
With all this,
Is it necessary for a girl to do a job?

1441
01:30:47,615 --> 01:30:50,054
Do you leave town for this
reason? You would have explain us.

1442
01:30:50,346 --> 01:30:51,968
Where should I search for you?

1443
01:30:52,291 --> 01:30:53,759
Dad, please don't start it again.

1444
01:30:54,182 --> 01:30:57,137
You're a small girl.
You don't know about world.

1445
01:30:57,337 --> 01:31:01,047
Dad, if you speak so, this time it will
be difficult for you to find the address.

1446
01:31:01,247 --> 01:31:02,557
Don't blame me later.

1447
01:31:03,418 --> 01:31:06,556
You can stay if you want. You
can visit Kanaka Durga temple.

1448
01:31:07,318 --> 01:31:08,722
Don't try to disturb me.

1449
01:31:08,922 --> 01:31:10,756
Don't be so angry.

1450
01:31:10,956 --> 01:31:12,098
-Can't understand this girl.
-Oh my god!

1451
01:31:12,298 --> 01:31:14,147
Who will marry her if she
is behaving like this?

1452
01:31:18,261 --> 01:31:20,022
Excuse me!

1453
01:31:23,995 --> 01:31:26,128
-Buddy!
-Buddy!

1454
01:31:26,328 --> 01:31:27,781
-Buddy!
-Buddy!

1455
01:31:27,981 --> 01:31:30,352
-Buddy!
-Buddy!

1456
01:31:30,552 --> 01:31:33,414
Buddy! Leave me! I'll die.

1457
01:31:33,614 --> 01:31:35,314
It's been long time since we met.

1458
01:31:35,943 --> 01:31:37,604
Brother! How are you?

1459
01:31:37,804 --> 01:31:38,779
Careful!

1460
01:31:39,255 --> 01:31:40,435
God bless you!

1461
01:31:40,635 --> 01:31:42,735
I'm fine. Your family got increased.

1462
01:31:42,935 --> 01:31:43,745
Who are you?

1463
01:31:43,945 --> 01:31:45,200
Me?

1464
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:50,043
I'm the one who did the marriage
of him with great arrangements.

1465
01:31:50,918 --> 01:31:53,010
He is a god to me.

1466
01:31:53,210 --> 01:31:54,647
I didn't get you.

1467
01:31:54,847 --> 01:31:56,467
Okay. I'll explain you in detail. Come on.

1468
01:31:56,667 --> 01:31:59,000
-Sit!
-Sit!

1469
01:32:00,082 --> 01:32:04,010
Dear! It was in the year 1990.

1470
01:32:05,007 --> 01:32:08,871
He look so old now. But, back those days
he was the Pavan Kalyan of our collage.

1471
01:32:09,072 --> 01:32:10,030
Yeah!

1472
01:32:24,625 --> 01:32:25,789
Hi!

1473
01:32:32,474 --> 01:32:34,187
[people screaming]

1474
01:32:34,387 --> 01:32:36,245
-What happened?
-Girisam attempted suicide.

1475
01:32:37,113 --> 01:32:40,737
Parents are not allowing
Kumari to come out of the house.

1476
01:32:42,114 --> 01:32:43,045
-Is that your problem?
-Yes!

1477
01:32:43,303 --> 01:32:45,701
-I'll bring her out and get you married.
-Is it?

1478
01:32:50,532 --> 01:32:52,877
If you move a step ahead, I will stab you.

1479
01:32:53,077 --> 01:32:55,561
Do you know whom you're talking with?

1480
01:32:55,761 --> 01:32:57,121
I'm Nandha. Nandha!

1481
01:32:57,321 --> 01:33:00,218
Raj! Deefak Raj!

1482
01:33:00,936 --> 01:33:03,185
She will be happy if she marry him.

1483
01:33:03,385 --> 01:33:05,116
Listen to me and bless them.

1484
01:33:05,352 --> 01:33:07,594
It don't happen.

1485
01:33:07,794 --> 01:33:09,332
-Get up!
Please!

1486
01:33:09,532 --> 01:33:10,489
Hey! Hey!

1487
01:33:11,326 --> 01:33:14,563
If you try to divide them,
I will cut your throat.

1488
01:33:17,693 --> 01:33:21,786
Buddy! How can I repay you for
the help you have done to me?

1489
01:33:21,986 --> 01:33:24,893
Give birth to beautiful
baby girls. That's my gift.

1490
01:33:25,358 --> 01:33:26,990
Wow! You're great.

1491
01:33:27,318 --> 01:33:28,712
Don't make me a hero.

1492
01:33:28,912 --> 01:33:32,021
We as your fans won't accept
it, if you deny though.

1493
01:33:32,221 --> 01:33:34,244
Why are you here as sudden surprise?

1494
01:33:34,444 --> 01:33:36,020
How do you know that we are here?

1495
01:33:36,549 --> 01:33:39,440
I'm here for Naina!
I found out that she stays here.

1496
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:42,050
Buddy, what's the matter
between you and her?

1497
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:44,542
I'm here to set an
alliance with her father.

1498
01:33:46,092 --> 01:33:49,559
Dear, she is so lucky to
get an alliance like this.

1499
01:33:50,336 --> 01:33:53,363
After all this years,
I got a chance to repay my buddy.

1500
01:33:53,563 --> 01:33:54,920
Our daughter is in love it seems.

1501
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:57,476
Nayana is my daughter.

1502
01:33:57,676 --> 01:33:59,443
I'm ready to get into
an alliance with you.

1503
01:33:59,672 --> 01:34:03,229
Thank god. My marriage is fixed
with a fight is second half. Thank you.

1504
01:34:03,429 --> 01:34:05,115
-By the way. Where is the guy?
-Please be quiet.

1505
01:34:05,614 --> 01:34:06,858
Don't you introduce him to us?

1506
01:34:07,058 --> 01:34:07,742
Which guy are you talking about?

1507
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:09,168
I'm talking about your son.

1508
01:34:09,368 --> 01:34:10,814
Not my son. I'm the guy ready to marry.

1509
01:34:11,156 --> 01:34:12,287
Son-in-law?

1510
01:34:12,663 --> 01:34:15,521
Please don't call me so mother-in-law.
Your relations will get changed.

1511
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:18,245
Father-in-law!

1512
01:34:18,631 --> 01:34:20,122
Am I father-in-law to you?

1513
01:34:20,322 --> 01:34:21,657
Do you the age
difference between both of you?

1514
01:34:21,926 --> 01:34:24,023
Age is not a matter.
Love don't care about age.

1515
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:26,961
It was your girl who proposed me first.

1516
01:34:27,217 --> 01:34:28,173
You can enquire her.

1517
01:34:28,373 --> 01:34:29,807
-Nayana!
Call her!

1518
01:34:31,528 --> 01:34:33,541
What is this?
Are we here to see this nuisance?

1519
01:34:33,808 --> 01:34:36,104
This old man is
saying that you loved him.

1520
01:34:36,304 --> 01:34:37,846
-It's no that...
-Tell them Nayana.

1521
01:34:38,046 --> 01:34:39,334
Tell them that you love him.

1522
01:34:39,815 --> 01:34:41,993
You are brave enough to propose him on
the road. But can't you tell them now?

1523
01:34:42,324 --> 01:34:43,345
You want to marry him, right?

1524
01:34:43,825 --> 01:34:44,598
Who is this guy?

1525
01:34:45,271 --> 01:34:46,324
He is Nayana's friend.

1526
01:34:46,802 --> 01:34:47,757
And he is my well wisher too.

1527
01:34:47,957 --> 01:34:48,965
What is this dear?

1528
01:34:50,315 --> 01:34:52,471
Yes, dad. I love him
and I wan to marry him.

1529
01:34:55,631 --> 01:34:56,421
Hi, darling!

1530
01:34:57,069 --> 01:34:59,242
-Come on darling, Lets go the park?
-Okay!

1531
01:34:59,561 --> 01:35:00,946
Please stop them.

1532
01:35:01,996 --> 01:35:03,033
What is this, man?

1533
01:35:03,233 --> 01:35:04,272
You told that you are her friend.

1534
01:35:04,472 --> 01:35:05,489
Tell me, what's the matter?

1535
01:35:05,717 --> 01:35:07,789
She stopped talking to me,
because I said everything.

1536
01:35:08,688 --> 01:35:11,566
I didn't understand that when
he who got us married said...

1537
01:35:11,808 --> 01:35:14,575
give birth to a girl
child and give her to me.

1538
01:35:15,975 --> 01:35:17,267
I don't know what you will do.

1539
01:35:17,619 --> 01:35:20,699
-You should stop this nonsense anyhow.
-Leave it to me, father-in-law,

1540
01:35:20,899 --> 01:35:21,868
I will take care of him.

1541
01:35:22,908 --> 01:35:23,558
Ah?

1542
01:35:26,023 --> 01:35:27,070
Father-in-law?

1543
01:35:29,350 --> 01:35:30,952
Is father-in-law
written on my forehead?

1544
01:35:31,152 --> 01:35:32,634
[indistinct people chattering]

1545
01:35:36,717 --> 01:35:41,480
"Baby, I love you dear,
look at me with all your heart"

1546
01:35:41,806 --> 01:35:46,406
"Don't say no,
don't go from rest of my life"

1547
01:35:49,102 --> 01:35:50,545
I want to share a thing with you.

1548
01:35:50,935 --> 01:35:51,724
No need, I know everything.

1549
01:35:52,361 --> 01:35:53,235
I know everything.

1550
01:35:53,435 --> 01:35:55,317
-Ah, no this one is very important.

01:36:00,242 --> 01:36:01,773
Give me the auspicious thread.

1554
01:36:01,973 --> 01:36:03,014
Hey,

1555
01:36:03,214 --> 01:36:05,710
Get us both married not them.

1556
01:36:05,910 --> 01:36:08,178
Sir, we only get couples married.

1557
01:36:08,378 --> 01:36:09,354
Even we are also lovers.

1558
01:36:09,554 --> 01:36:11,430
Come, and get us narrued,

1559
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:12,816
-Come on....
-They aren't thingking in that way, sir.

1560
01:36:13,016 --> 01:36:13,855
Then, what are they thinking?

1561
01:36:14,055 --> 01:36:15,423
They are thinking that you
are father and a daughter.

1562
01:36:16,183 --> 01:36:17,852
are they thinking that we
are father and daughter?

1563
01:36:17,966 --> 01:36:18,958
Did they told you by calliing?

1564
01:36:19,430 --> 01:36:21,551
Did I told you that we both
are father and the daughter?

1565
01:36:21,751 --> 01:36:22,908
-Did I told you?
-Ah! Sir, sir...

1566
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:24,069
Did I told you?

1567
01:36:24,864 --> 01:36:26,395
Oh no! Naiyan.

1568
01:36:27,483 --> 01:36:29,097
[grunts]

1569
01:36:29,929 --> 01:36:30,579
Damn!

1570
01:36:30,801 --> 01:36:32,589
Hubby, that person,

1571
01:36:32,884 --> 01:36:35,819
might have done
something to the brother and her.

1572
01:36:36,019 --> 01:36:36,790
Is it?

1573
01:36:37,286 --> 01:36:38,158
You wait.

1574
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:41,396
-Hello?
-Helllo.

1575
01:36:41,596 --> 01:36:44,345
Son, my daughter looks very disturbed.

1576
01:36:44,710 --> 01:36:45,852
She is breaking everything.

1577
01:36:46,167 --> 01:36:47,718
Let her break everything.

1578
01:36:48,638 --> 01:36:50,347
What will happen to you
it's our loss, right?

1579
01:36:51,107 --> 01:36:52,191
-Naiyan...
-Ah?

1580
01:36:52,964 --> 01:36:54,696
Again that old fellow has come, man.

1581
01:36:54,931 --> 01:36:56,821
Immediately send him to Naina's room.

1582
01:36:57,162 --> 01:36:58,465
Ah? What are you talking?

1583
01:36:58,665 --> 01:36:59,815
Send him, father-in-law.

1584
01:37:00,258 --> 01:37:01,133
Maa...

1585
01:37:02,518 --> 01:37:04,366
They say a mad man's wife
is a relative to everyone.

1586
01:37:04,566 --> 01:37:06,737
Why is everyone calling me father-in-law?

1587
01:37:07,229 --> 01:37:08,391
Father-in-law.

1588
01:37:08,907 --> 01:37:10,595
Where is Naina?

1589
01:37:10,795 --> 01:37:11,964
Is she up stairs?

1590
01:37:12,343 --> 01:37:13,880
She is up stairs of course.

1591
01:37:14,230 --> 01:37:15,686
-Go, go.
-Thank you.

1592
01:37:16,219 --> 01:37:17,639
Aunty, please move.

1593
01:37:17,839 --> 01:37:18,841
-Brother!
-Go.

1594
01:37:23,067 --> 01:37:25,186
Naiyan... what is this?

1595
01:37:25,734 --> 01:37:27,840
You know how much risk
I had taken for you, right?

1596
01:37:28,163 --> 01:37:31,290
If you had wait for 2 more minutes,
both our marriage would have done.

1597
01:37:31,868 --> 01:37:33,348
Marriage and with you>

1598
01:37:33,548 --> 01:37:34,657
Huh! You are old.

1599
01:37:35,084 --> 01:37:36,281
And you want to get married to me?

1600
01:37:36,610 --> 01:37:38,437
Marriage, huh?
[slaps]

1601
01:37:41,307 --> 01:37:45,096
Sir, it's not even 24
hours that my love has started.

1602
01:37:45,296 --> 01:37:46,487
But it has ended, sir.

1603
01:37:46,687 --> 01:37:48,199
-Wouldn't it? Now--
-Sir, sir,...

1604
01:37:48,399 --> 01:37:50,325
Sir, please talk slowly.

1605
01:37:50,525 --> 01:37:53,303
Wouldn't it end? Do you know
how fast is todays generation?

1606
01:37:53,503 --> 01:37:55,161
Why do I need about
todays generation, sir?

1607
01:37:55,970 --> 01:37:58,578
Give me any idea on how
to get close to Naina, sir.

1608
01:37:58,778 --> 01:37:59,765
Why do you need the idea,

1609
01:37:59,965 --> 01:38:00,878
leave it to me I will take care.

1610
01:38:01,078 --> 01:38:03,542
You leave, I will take care...

1611
01:38:03,742 --> 01:38:06,994
I can't understand
when you say like this.

1612
01:38:07,365 --> 01:38:08,690
-That's it, right? Come.
-Yes.

1613
01:38:10,082 --> 01:38:12,298
If I get the clarity
then you'll also get it.

1614
01:38:12,406 --> 01:38:13,056
Yes.

1615
01:38:13,201 --> 01:38:15,040
If she is convinced to me, that
means she has convinced to you too.

1616
01:38:15,119 --> 01:38:16,828
-Correct.
-If she fall for me, that means she will fall for you.

1617
01:38:17,527 --> 01:38:19,282
Here I don't understand, sir.

1618
01:38:19,711 --> 01:38:22,454
How can she galls fr me
if she galls for you, sir?

1619
01:38:22,654 --> 01:38:23,484
=Deepak Raj!
-Yes.

1620
01:38:23,684 --> 01:38:25,343
Listen to what I say.

[fast forwarded speech]

1622
01:38:27,562 --> 01:38:28,351
That's what, sir!

1623
01:38:28,551 --> 01:38:30,245
That's what I don't understand, sir.

1624
01:38:31,170 --> 01:38:33,065
How can she falls for me if
she had fallen for you, sir?

1625
01:38:33,265 --> 01:38:35,036
I know my personality and myself.

1626
01:38:35,236 --> 01:38:36,833
How can she falls for me if
she had fallen for you, sir?

1627
01:38:36,902 --> 01:38:38,158
-Deepak Raj.
-Yes?

1628
01:38:39,322 --> 01:38:41,650
-If I get the clarity first...
-Yeah..,

1629
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:44,247
-You will also get the clarity.
-That's right.

1630
01:38:44,447 --> 01:38:47,149
If she is convinced with me,
she will get conficed to you too.

1631
01:38:47,349 --> 01:38:48,210
This is also right,

1632
01:38:48,410 --> 01:38:52,034
Only if she is okay with me then
only I can make her agree to you.

1633
01:38:52,234 --> 01:38:54,236
That is why she will get convinced
to you once she is fallen for me.

1634
01:38:55,732 --> 01:38:56,963
-Yes or no?
-Yes.

1635
01:38:58,494 --> 01:39:02,805
You said 'no' till yesterday, how did
you get convinced just in a single night?

1636
01:39:04,184 --> 01:39:05,268
I gave it a thought mom.

1637
01:39:05,584 --> 01:39:09,127
Am I right, who came this far
leaving you all for my happiness,

1638
01:39:09,429 --> 01:39:13,289
Or Shiva who left me for
the sake of the family.

1639
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:17,998
I felt it is my
selfishness and it's love with him.

1640
01:39:18,940 --> 01:39:20,956
I called him to tell sorry in the night.

1641
01:39:21,296 --> 01:39:22,727
But he united our both
families in the morning.

1642
01:39:23,358 --> 01:39:26,274
Brother-in-law,
you don't have to think of anything.

1643
01:39:26,474 --> 01:39:27,767
How much dowry do you want

01:39:27,967 --> 01:39:31,130
What type of gifts interest you,
tell me clearly.

1645

I've gathered some 500 acres already!

1646
01:39:33,218 --> 01:39:35,065
How can we get love with
money, brother-in-law.

1647
01:39:35,834 --> 01:39:40,326
You are sending a girl who couldn't
bear even if his own father says a word.

1648
01:39:41,244 --> 01:39:44,800
as a father you gave me the
chance to fulfil my sons life.

1649
01:39:45,062 --> 01:39:46,112
This is enough, brother-in-law.

-Oh. I am sorry... I forget.
-You willl forget man.

1653

-Yeah.

They will get to know, be silent.

-Hello?
-Nothing, bro...

1695
01:41:41,877 --> 01:41:43,625
I felt like telling you a story.

1696
01:41:45,590 --> 01:41:47,553
Once upon a time there was a forest.

1697
01:41:47,753 --> 01:41:49,813
A goat which went for
food in that forest.

1698
01:41:50,189 --> 01:41:52,235
Ha mistakenly disturbed a Tiger.

1699
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:54,213
It left home after finishing her food.

1700
01:41:54,503 --> 01:41:57,039
After returning home,
all other goats told it that,

1701
01:41:57,239 --> 01:42:01,802
'you disturbed a tiger, it won't
leave you, it will kill you and eat you.'

1702
01:42:04,933 --> 01:42:08,382
That goat couldn't hide its
fear and couldn't kill it's ego,

1703
01:42:08,780 --> 01:42:11,118
how courageous it was
when it disturbed it,

1704
01:42:11,318 --> 01:42:13,299
with the same courage
it went to the forest.

1705
01:42:13,588 --> 01:42:17,666
And asked tiger, what has
happened is happened, forgive me,

1706
01:42:17,866 --> 01:42:19,554
let us compromise.

1707
01:42:20,813 --> 01:42:25,100
Seeing the situation even
the tiger agreed to compromize.

1708
01:42:25,689 --> 01:42:28,276
With that the goat
felt it is all settled,

1709
01:42:28,476 --> 01:42:32,903
happily it settled it's
marrige with a female goat.

1710
01:42:34,478 --> 01:42:38,485
But, the who compromised didn't leave it.

1711
01:42:39,610 --> 01:42:42,463
It attacked the family of
the goats and ate them.

1712
01:42:44,502 --> 01:42:47,570
Why did the tiger break the word?

1713
01:42:48,376 --> 01:42:52,145
Because the tiger lied.

1714
01:42:54,378 --> 01:42:57,045
The group of goats is your family.

1715
01:42:57,245 --> 01:42:57,978

you give me your house when asked?

I mean,
he don't have the habit to say so.

1795

I don't think he would say.

You want your son, I want his apology.

1797

You want this to get to an
end and I want to win this.

people say that I am egoist, right?

1799
01:49:25,384 --> 01:49:29,387
I am telling that I will forgive
the one who layed hand on me, right?

1800
01:49:30,070 --> 01:49:31,513
How, would I am an egoist?

1801
01:49:32,737 --> 01:49:36,155
If I had gone for ego,
I should have killed him, right?

1802
01:49:38,094 --> 01:49:38,859
You understood it, right?

1803
01:49:39,608 --> 01:49:40,365
You can leave now.

1804
01:49:40,671 --> 01:49:42,853
You just have two ways from this house.

1805
01:49:43,255 --> 01:49:44,705
One is to Kasi's house

1806
01:49:44,905 --> 01:49:46,234
and the second is to the grave yard.

1807
01:49:46,617 --> 01:49:48,361
If you get your son then come here,

1808
01:49:48,973 --> 01:49:50,927

He fought for his family.

1811
01:50:07,438 --> 01:50:10,713
Now if I ask him to
give an apology to Kasi...

1812
01:50:13,076 --> 01:50:14,133
I can't do that mistake.

1813
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:16,859
But I can't stop Kasi too.

1814
01:50:18,534 --> 01:50:20,255
He can do anything to satisfy his ego.

1815

There is only one way
to stop this querrel.

1816
01:50:25,142 --> 01:50:26,838
Shiva should give an apology to Kasi.

1817

It is only possible for you.

1819

He will listen to you.

1820
01:50:34,856 --> 01:50:35,795
Tell him that it is for your sake.

1821
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:37,838
Tell him that it's for our family sake.

responsibility to convince him.

1863
01:55:00,602 --> 01:55:04,767
"The beautiful girl is shining brightly"

1864
01:55:05,672 --> 01:55:10,200
"At the time of engagement"

1865
01:55:10,837 --> 01:55:14,830
"Why do you play around with me?"

1866
01:55:15,508 --> 01:55:20,241
"I'll be there on a snap of your fingers,
I'll take you for a ride on a horse cart"

1867
01:55:20,441 --> 01:55:24,378
"I will give myself to
you with my little finger"

1868
01:55:24,578 --> 01:55:29,162
"Hey, don't consume my heart...
don't do it"

1869
01:55:29,685 --> 01:55:34,508
"Like we stole the sweet from
Setty's store in our childhood"

1870
01:55:34,708 --> 01:55:39,318
"Like we eat the snacks
hidden by mom"

1871
01:55:40,101 --> 01:55:41,807
Wow, it's very nice like this Naina.

1872
01:55:42,593 --> 01:55:43,743
I love you Naina.

1873
01:55:44,085 --> 01:55:46,393
Naina, if I had know it would
be like this if we get married,

1874
01:55:46,776 --> 01:55:48,726
-I'd have married you long back.
-Hey, wake up!

1875
01:55:51,346 --> 01:55:53,314
Hey, how come are you here?

1876
01:55:53,953 --> 01:55:54,866
How did you come here?

1877
01:55:55,393 --> 01:55:58,037
I am right here. You are in your dreams.

1878
01:55:58,237 --> 01:56:03,084
Wow! If in dreams I am feeling like
that, it would be great in real.

1879
01:56:04,698 --> 01:56:07,274
You say like this
only, but I can't sleep.

1880
01:56:08,022 --> 01:56:10,959
First I remember you,
later I remember your issue with Kasi.

1881
01:56:11,159 --> 01:56:12,472
Hey, chill.

1882
01:56:13,562 --> 01:56:14,621
I can't.

1883
01:56:14,821 --> 01:56:16,882
Do something and end this, right.

1884
01:56:17,082 --> 01:56:18,999
I hit him, when he came for
the house, when he came for dad

1885
01:56:19,199 --> 01:56:21,124
and also on me,
still how many times I have to hit him?

1886
01:56:21,904 --> 01:56:26,004
Um,
can't you hit him on his ego for once?

1887
01:56:26,492 --> 01:56:29,195
If it gets satisfied,
he won't come to us.

1888
01:56:29,945 --> 01:56:30,885
Tell me clearly.

1889
01:56:31,345 --> 01:56:35,444
Nothing,
can you give an apology to Kasi, right?

1890
01:56:37,578 --> 01:56:38,565
That idiot will fall silent then.

1891
01:56:38,845 --> 01:56:40,382
Get out! Get up!

1892
01:56:41,035 --> 01:56:42,842
Shiva! Shiva.

1893
01:56:43,223 --> 01:56:44,247
Shiva you are hurting me.

1894
01:56:45,724 --> 01:56:46,583
-Shiva leave me.
-Hey, leave her.

1895
01:56:47,808 --> 01:56:49,268
-Leave her.
-Get out of the house.

1896
01:56:49,646 --> 01:56:51,279
-What are you talking?
-Do you know what she said?

1897
01:56:52,077 --> 01:56:53,393
I have to give an apology to Kasi,
it seems.

1898
01:56:59,853 --> 01:57:01,745
He did the mistake,
he was the one who broke his promise.

1899
01:57:02,287 --> 01:57:03,974
He even thought to kill my family.

1900
01:57:05,204 --> 01:57:06,687
And you wnat me to apologise to him?

1901
01:57:08,040 --> 01:57:10,432
If the same happens to your
family would you talk like this?

1902
01:57:12,279 --> 01:57:13,891
You asked me to make him agree, right?

1903
01:57:14,682 --> 01:57:15,931
Why don't you talk?

1904
01:57:24,195 --> 01:57:26,655
Is she telling the truth? Tell me.

1905
01:57:29,075 --> 01:57:29,676
Yes, it's true.

1906
01:57:29,991 --> 01:57:31,679
What mistake I did that I
should say sorry to him, dad?

1907
01:57:33,727 --> 01:57:35,928
Say something, dad...

1908
01:57:36,489 --> 01:57:37,439
What do you expect me to say?

1909
01:57:38,389 --> 01:57:39,283
What do you expect me to say?

1910
01:57:40,477 --> 01:57:43,937
I can slap and say that you have
done a mistake if I had a bad son.

1911
01:57:45,376 --> 01:57:47,530
But I know that you didn't
do any mistake, son.

1912
01:57:48,404 --> 01:57:49,801
I know that you are right.

1913
01:57:51,126 --> 01:57:53,319
But whatever is going on
in your life isn't right.

1914
01:57:54,898 --> 01:57:58,683
Not knowing how to explain it or what to
do, I am experiencing hell from 2 days.

1915
01:58:00,421 --> 01:58:01,386
Listen, son...

1916
01:58:02,358 --> 01:58:04,755
For those who have not had
children even after 25 years of marriage,

1917
01:58:05,478 --> 01:58:08,173
the happiness the get when they get
to know that their first child is born,

1918
01:58:08,381 --> 01:58:09,956
the same happiness is what I am feeling.

1919
01:58:11,628 --> 01:58:14,761
Hey, showing you a nice future,

1920
01:58:15,691 --> 01:58:17,585
I want to feel proud as a father.

1921
01:58:19,136 --> 01:58:21,042
But that Kari won't
let any of this happen.

1922
01:58:23,530 --> 01:58:27,292
I couldn't stop him,
or couldn't lose you,

1923
01:58:29,023 --> 01:58:33,019
I couldn't come before you
and ask you to apologise to him

1924
01:58:33,693 --> 01:58:35,327
So I requested this innocent girl.

1925
01:58:38,641 --> 01:58:43,050
Hey, once... say sorry for once.

1926
01:58:47,756 --> 01:58:51,279
Hey, I said I will say
sorry by bowing near his legs,

1927
01:58:52,095 --> 01:58:53,245
but he did not agree.

1928
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,511
He wants an apology from you only.

1929
01:58:56,324 --> 01:58:57,423
This is my life--

1930
01:59:01,030 --> 01:59:01,995
What is this dad?

1931
01:59:03,369 --> 01:59:04,547
I thought we had become close.

1932
01:59:05,911 --> 01:59:08,212
But you left the gap as
it is between us, dad.

1933
01:59:09,910 --> 01:59:10,991
You should have told me, right?

1934
01:59:12,968 --> 01:59:16,163
Before the love you are showing,
few letter word 'sorry' is nothing.

1935
01:59:16,778 --> 01:59:18,785
Not once, I would say as
many times as you want me to.

1936
01:59:19,627 --> 01:59:20,941
Hey, give me a word.

1937
01:59:22,346 --> 01:59:25,048
Whatever he says,
or whatever happens there,

1938
01:59:25,476 --> 01:59:26,991
promise me that you won't get angry.

1939
01:59:28,244 --> 01:59:29,512
You are leave me no option, dad.

1940
01:59:29,818 --> 01:59:30,855
Promise me, son.

1941
01:59:31,304 --> 01:59:34,577
I give you my word, I won't react.

1942
01:59:54,250 --> 01:59:56,943
Hey! When did they come?

1943
02:00:01,078 --> 02:00:03,773
Hey, you said that
you would blast my heart

1944
02:00:04,714 --> 02:00:06,450
Why are you standing
like a stone here?

1945
02:00:08,771 --> 02:00:11,034
Are you here for your
life or for you dad?

1946
02:00:12,646 --> 02:00:13,665
For apologising.

1947
02:00:13,865 --> 02:00:15,629
Louder, I can't hear you.

1948
02:00:16,442 --> 02:00:20,078
Brother, I beg you.
I have lost my sense that I opposed you.

1949
02:00:20,657 --> 02:00:22,807
I did it not knowing who Kasi is.

1950
02:00:23,608 --> 02:00:26,086
I will live telling your
name, please forgive me.

1951
02:00:26,722 --> 02:00:29,009
Guys, he is asking forgiveness,

1952
02:00:29,822 --> 02:00:32,262
-shall we let him live?
-He should ask us too, brother.

1953
02:00:36,574 --> 02:00:39,675
Beg to us, beg us to let you leave alive.

1954
02:00:43,770 --> 02:00:47,168
Brother, I beg you.
Please ask him to forgive me.

1955
02:00:47,664 --> 02:00:49,974
I won't lay hands in front of you,
I will not even lift my head.

1956
02:00:50,174 --> 02:00:50,830
Please.

1957
02:00:51,889 --> 02:00:52,588
Wow.

1958
02:00:53,356 --> 02:00:55,095
What a father and son combo you both are,

1959
02:00:55,449 --> 02:00:56,203
super!

1960
02:00:56,815 --> 02:00:58,871
Son who is begging for
the sake of his father.

1961
02:00:59,277 --> 02:01:01,443
And father who gave his house
for the sake of his son.

1962
02:01:09,518 --> 02:01:13,503
I don't like a man who bows his
head, or a woman who raises her head.

1963
02:01:14,372 --> 02:01:15,052
Get lost!

1964
02:01:27,231 --> 02:01:31,769
[music mutes voices]

1965
02:01:37,250 --> 02:01:38,867
[music mutes voice]

1966
02:01:50,232 --> 02:01:52,402
Will you leave the one who
insulted you in front of everyone,

1967
02:01:52,602 --> 02:01:54,080
for a small sorry?

1968
02:01:54,317 --> 02:01:57,720
When he gave his house as a alms to you,
you leave him without doing anything?

1969
02:01:58,313 --> 02:01:59,388
That's not right, brother.

1970
02:01:59,755 --> 02:02:02,667
If this news gets out, even
a stray dog of Vijayawada,

1971
02:02:02,867 --> 02:02:04,833
will pee in front of Kasi's house.

1972
02:02:05,146 --> 02:02:06,759
It would apologize if you shout on it.

1973
02:02:06,959 --> 02:02:07,802
Is that okay?

1974
02:02:08,661 --> 02:02:09,409
Is it okay to you?

1975
02:02:10,925 --> 02:02:13,071
His father is worried
what happens to his son,

1976
02:02:13,271 --> 02:02:17,591
if he gets into qurrels and murders.

1977
02:02:17,986 --> 02:02:19,013
That is why,

1978
02:02:19,370 --> 02:02:22,690
the one who was ready
to die for that house,

1979
02:02:22,890 --> 02:02:26,256
has given the document to
us as a piece of paper today.

1980
02:02:27,182 --> 02:02:30,201
After these many years,
his father became close to him,

1981
02:02:30,401 --> 02:02:33,012
with the fear he would
again go away from him,

1982
02:02:33,212 --> 02:02:36,453
he bowed his head though he could fight.

1983
02:02:36,653 --> 02:02:38,924
Hey, their sentiment is their curse.

1984
02:02:39,583 --> 02:02:41,763
If we make him a goon,
his then father would be finish.

1985
02:02:42,115 --> 02:02:45,408
If he becomes then his father won't let
him inside the house so, he is finished,

1986
02:02:45,608 --> 02:02:46,468
Finish!

1987
02:02:46,668 --> 02:02:48,322
[laughs]

1988
02:02:49,639 --> 02:02:52,485
Brother, our man is in the hospital.

1989
02:02:52,685 --> 02:02:53,480
Let us meet him, come on.

1990
02:02:53,680 --> 02:02:55,182
-How is he doctor?
-He is alright.

1991
02:02:55,907 --> 02:02:57,023
I am discharging him tomorrow.

1992
02:02:57,395 --> 02:02:59,198
-You do the payment mean while.
-Thank you doctor.

1993
02:02:59,398 --> 02:03:00,516
Um... If you don't mind,

1994
02:03:00,716 --> 02:03:03,251
How are you related to him?
You are taking care of him daily.

1995
02:03:03,451 --> 02:03:06,315
Does that should be a relative
to ask about good and bad days.

1996
02:03:06,515 --> 02:03:07,794
I am just a common man.

1997
02:03:17,873 --> 02:03:19,368
It's okay, sleep.

1998
02:03:19,568 --> 02:03:21,189
-Who do you feel now?
-I feel good, brother.

1999
02:03:21,713 --> 02:03:23,084
I survived by God's grace.

2000
02:03:23,284 --> 02:03:26,619
Anyway, what is this man?
Don't you care about your life?

2001
02:03:26,819 --> 02:03:28,198
I am living for you, boss.

2002
02:03:28,398 --> 02:03:31,472
Not just this,
I will give my life for you, boss.

2003
02:03:34,803 --> 02:03:36,533
Shiva! Shiva!
[pants]

2004
02:03:37,398 --> 02:03:38,996
It seems, the person you
stabbed died in the hospital.

2005
02:03:41,515 --> 02:03:42,978
Cops are coming to arrest you.

2006
02:03:44,260 --> 02:03:46,126
-Did he die?
-Yes, uncle.

2007
02:03:46,326 --> 02:03:47,377
He was fine when I went
to see him in the morning.

2008
02:03:47,707 --> 02:03:48,716
He was going to discharge tomorrow--

2009
02:03:53,850 --> 02:03:56,739
What is this, son?

2010
02:03:56,939 --> 02:03:58,103
He didn't die, dad.

2011
02:03:58,822 --> 02:03:59,848
Kasi killed him.

2012
02:04:00,178 --> 02:04:01,003
What are you saying?

2013
02:04:02,170 --> 02:04:04,190
He said he will leave you
if you say sorry, right?

2014
02:04:04,917 --> 02:04:06,060
What is this again?

2015
02:04:06,260 --> 02:04:07,829
Your way isn't right for him dad.

2016
02:04:08,029 --> 02:04:08,702
I am the right person for him.

2017
02:04:09,327 --> 02:04:10,908
He won't listen if we bow our heads,

2018
02:04:11,541 --> 02:04:13,236
-we have to cut his head.
-Shiva!

2019
02:04:13,738 --> 02:04:15,281
Only one can be alive in this city.

2020
02:04:15,866 --> 02:04:18,925
That might be Kasi,
or Shiva you will get to knoow today.

2021
02:04:24,613 --> 02:04:28,727
[both laughing]

2022
02:04:30,424 --> 02:04:31,765
Not the real joy starts.

2023
02:04:32,613 --> 02:04:34,099
Call him once.
[phone rings]

2024
02:04:36,220 --> 02:04:37,113
He is only calling brother.

2025
02:04:41,710 --> 02:04:44,771
What?
Did you understand who is Kasi, now?

2026
02:04:45,661 --> 02:04:46,987
The hunt has begun.

2027
02:04:47,864 --> 02:04:49,945
Run, run away.

2028
02:04:51,713 --> 02:04:54,406
Hey, I should have killed you in
the very beginning, but you escaped.

2029
02:04:54,584 --> 02:04:56,960
I should have killed you when you
hit me on road, but you escaped.

2030
02:04:57,286 --> 02:04:59,294
You can't run anymore. Run!

2031
02:05:01,358 --> 02:05:05,424
Your dad felt very much that you
shouldn't become a rowdy, but I made you.

2032
02:05:05,624 --> 02:05:08,003
There is a charge opened on you. Run!

2033
02:05:10,116 --> 02:05:12,655
Hey, did you became dumb or
did your heart stopped?

2034
02:05:12,965 --> 02:05:13,870
Come on, talke.

2035
02:05:14,219 --> 02:05:15,553
You made a mistake Kasi.

2036
02:05:17,923 --> 02:05:19,736
You made a last mistake in your life.

2037
02:05:21,023 --> 02:05:24,396
Until now my dad struggled because
he doesn't want me to become a goon

2038
02:05:25,626 --> 02:05:27,312
But if that situation comes,

2039
02:05:28,126 --> 02:05:32,447
my dad would feel no matter if I
become a goon, rowdy or another Kasi,

2040
02:05:32,647 --> 02:05:34,957
it is enough if my son is alive.

2041
02:05:36,128 --> 02:05:38,281
How did you missed such
a small logic, man?

2042
02:05:40,063 --> 02:05:41,657
I am ready to go to jail.

2043
02:05:42,146 --> 02:05:43,691
But not for the murder which I didn't do.

2044
02:05:44,605 --> 02:05:46,823
I will go only after killing you
on road in front of everyone.

2045
02:05:47,023 --> 02:05:48,397
Hey! Hey! Hey!

2046
02:05:48,597 --> 02:05:49,937
Come, come...!

2047
02:05:50,661 --> 02:05:53,381
I will be waiting alone in
the center of Vijayawada.

2048
02:05:53,595 --> 02:05:54,571
-Come on!
-[screams]

2049

Guys...

2050
02:06:15,345 --> 02:06:18,403
he is the one who killed
one among you brutually.

2051
02:06:20,597 --> 02:06:24,363
His soul may not rest in
peace if we just do the rituals.

2052
02:06:24,808 --> 02:06:29,249
His soul would rest in peace
only when he is chopped into pieces.

2053
02:06:31,052 --> 02:06:32,776
Kill him!

2054
02:06:36,242 --> 02:06:36,920
Hey!

2055
02:06:45,234 --> 02:06:46,835
What's the querrel between you and me?

2056
02:06:47,570 --> 02:06:49,025
What's the querrel between you and me?

2057

Ow!

2060
02:07:04,704 --> 02:07:06,440
Why do you want to kill me?

2061
02:07:07,807 --> 02:07:10,119
Ow!

Hey!

2065

Ow!

2066
02:07:23,114 --> 02:07:23,935
Ow!

2067
02:07:24,953 --> 02:07:27,398
Hey! Ah!

[knife clanks]

2069
02:07:31,411 --> 02:07:32,389
What is he for you?

2070
02:07:33,870 --> 02:07:37,610
Is he your brother,
younger brother, or brother-in-law?

2071
02:07:39,782 --> 02:07:40,887
What is he for you?

2072
02:07:45,703 --> 02:07:46,423
Hey!

2073
02:07:48,213 --> 02:07:50,967
What is he for you?
What is he for you?

2074
02:07:51,167 --> 02:07:51,880
One among us.

2075
02:07:52,080 --> 02:07:54,196
Who will get lost if he is killed?

2076
02:07:54,721 --> 02:07:55,460
For whom, it is?

2077
02:07:56,494 --> 02:07:57,465
[groans]

2078
02:07:59,287 --> 02:08:01,452
To his wife and his family.

2079
02:08:04,594 --> 02:08:05,818
Then who has to take revange?

2080
02:08:06,593 --> 02:08:08,106
It's his wife's revange.

2081
02:08:10,912 --> 02:08:12,494
If she feels that I killed him,

2082
02:08:12,883 --> 02:08:15,474
and if she wants to kill me,
then ask her to come.

2083
02:08:17,157 --> 02:08:21,033
Without moving a step, without laying
hand, I will let her kill me bowing my head.

2084
02:08:21,867 --> 02:08:22,763
Call her.

[sword swishes]

2086

Before your husband's final
rituals completes, kill him

2087
02:08:41,309 --> 02:08:44,434
On the name of your ruined life,
kill him.

2088
02:08:56,109 --> 02:08:56,780
Go, dear.

2089
02:09:18,716 --> 02:09:21,197
Kill the person who widowed you.

2090
02:09:21,753 --> 02:09:25,148
Lakshmi don't leave the
perosn who killed your husband, kill him.

2091

Aye!

2092
02:09:34,503 --> 02:09:37,911
Kill that Ba****d brother.

2093
02:09:39,732 --> 02:09:41,694
If you want me to kill the
person who killed my husband.

2094
02:09:42,004 --> 02:09:43,882
Then I should kill that Kasi.

2095

[weeping]

2096
02:09:50,432 --> 02:09:51,805
I am there for you, boss.

2097
02:09:52,127 --> 02:09:55,162
Not only these knife
stabs, boss, I will die for you.

2098
02:09:55,579 --> 02:09:56,589
Then give it.

2099

-Oh no!
-Hey!

2103
02:10:07,029 --> 02:10:07,948
Please leave him, sir.

[sobbing]

2107
02:10:28,126 --> 02:10:32,962
When my husband was looking at
me for help, fighting with death.

2108
02:10:33,922 --> 02:10:36,770
I stopped for my daughter, brother.

2109
02:10:41,230 --> 02:10:44,793
When these men are saying
that they will die for you.

2110
02:10:45,439 --> 02:10:47,906
We thought he would be our support but,

2111
02:10:48,352 --> 02:10:50,966
we didn't thought that he will
make us orphans like this.

2112
02:10:52,147 --> 02:10:55,200
Brother, this Kasi has killed my husband.

2113
02:10:55,654 --> 02:10:56,708
This Kasi is the murderer.

2114
02:11:01,731 --> 02:11:06,861
His father wished for our lives asking
about him every day coming to hospital.

2115
02:11:07,806 --> 02:11:10,345
But for the one my husband fought,

2116
02:11:11,490 --> 02:11:14,045
came to the hospital for one time.

2117
02:11:14,951 --> 02:11:16,653
Not to make our lives better.

2118
02:11:17,074 --> 02:11:18,439
To kill.

2119
02:11:22,011 --> 02:11:24,933
They say, if we offer anything we like
going to Kashi something good happens.

2120
02:11:25,518 --> 02:11:29,337
Now, I am saying if you leave
this Kasi you all will be good.

2121
02:11:30,470 --> 02:11:34,412
Not one or two, hundreds of families
would have better lives.

2122
02:11:34,612 --> 02:11:36,144
Kill him, brother.

2123
02:11:38,241 --> 02:11:42,831
I opposed him because he has layed hands
on my father and disturbed my family.

2124
02:11:44,166 --> 02:11:46,843
But you gave me another
great reason to kill him, madam.

2125
02:11:47,160 --> 02:11:51,822
Hey, Kasi!
Diwali date for Vijayawada has changed.

I will give your house back to you.

Not only your house,
if you need I will give you my house.

2142
02:14:16,896 --> 02:14:18,438
I will leave Vijayawada, sir.

2143
02:14:18,762 --> 02:14:20,642
Please stop him, sir.
Or he will kill me.

2144
02:14:21,050 --> 02:14:22,467
At least you tell him madam.

2145
02:14:22,827 --> 02:14:25,396

times, but you didn't.

will stop and you will live.

If you want your life,
or business to run,

2159
02:15:25,816 --> 02:15:27,289
you have to give money.

2160
02:15:27,489 --> 02:15:30,237
From today,
this whole Vijayawada is mine.

Don't you goons get out
names other than holy places?

Hey!

2164
02:15:36,221 --> 02:15:39,148
Fine. I will give money
to safe guard my future.

2165
02:15:39,348 --> 02:15:40,983
But if I start giving money.

2166
02:15:41,183 --> 02:15:43,302
Then your future will become like that.
Is it okay, for you?

2167

-Sir, alms.

Hey, it could be any place but your games
can go on till just one person opposes you

2171
02:15:53,640 --> 02:15:56,218
If one does,
the same scene will repeat.

2172
02:15:56,418 --> 02:15:57,512
Are you trying to scare me?

2173

I have a knife in my hands,
can't you see?

2174
