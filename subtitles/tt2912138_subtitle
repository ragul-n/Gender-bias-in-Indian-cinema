"Challenge 2."

00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:38,125
'Debnagar.'

6
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:40,291
'A notorious place of West Bengal.'

7
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,791
'The aspirations of an
ordinary man to become great..'

8
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:44,416
'..is the basic reason for the
nomenclature of this place.'

9
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:45,333
Hail.
- Debraj!

10
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:46,083
'Debraj Rai.'

11
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,208
Hail.
- Debraj!

12

'There are around 1000
families staying in Debnagar.'

13
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,208
'In the year 2007,
the state government..'

14
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:55,166
'..gave 10,000 acres
of land of Debnagar..'

15
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,166
'..the status of
Special Economic zone.'

'Every time, Debraj Rai
comes down to the streets.'

17
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,041
'Debnagar's ordinary
citizens are used by him..'

18
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,416
'..to make a committee to
protest against the division of land.'

19
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,166
We will give blood and life.

20
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:08,958
But Debnagar's land will not be..

21
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,208
'State government's wrath is
felt by the normal citizens.'

22
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:12,166
Debnagar's development..

23
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,458
'On one side, there is
protest and rebellion.'

24
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:14,208
Listen to me carefully.

25
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,541
'And on the other side, the
power show of the government.

00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,500

caused death of so many people..'

'..Debraj Rai sat for
food strike till death.'

28
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,916
'The government bowed down
to the demands of Debraj Rai.'

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
'The government is
compelled to give in.'

30
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,458
'The decision to divide
the land is taken back.'

31
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:31,541
Debraj Rai.
- Hail.

32
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,208
Hail, hail.
- Hail.

33
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,666
'And ever since that day..'

34
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,916
'..Debraj Rai became God

'The destroyer of
all the evil forces.'

'In order to develop the state
of the people of Debnagar..'

38
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:52,291
'..Debraj Rai stood for
the election independently.'

39
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,541
'And won without any contest.'
- Debraj Rai. - Hail.

40
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,166
'After becoming the leader..'

41
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,833
'.. Debraj's focus and
knowledge becomes focused on Debnagar.'

42
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,833
'In this big war, his
companions were a few close workers.'

43
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:06,000
'His political companion.
Krishna Maitra.'

00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,916
'Alias Keshto Mittir.'

45
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,333
'Shibnath.'

00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,500
'He was not only a
close friend of Debraj.'

47
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,500
'He was an
unwavering devotee of Debraj.'

48

'Jagannath.'

'Alias Chokh Kota Joga.'

50
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,250
'Debraj's another trusted associate.'

51
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,375
'Anshuman. The younger
brother of Debraj Rai.'

52
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,583
'He is a doctor by profession.'

53
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,250
'But after getting
influenced by his brother..'

54
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,375
'..he has left the medical line..'

55
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:27,833
'..he has become a activist..'

56
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,000
'..and he has involved himself in
the betterment of the poor people.'

57
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:30,875
Hail Debraj.
- Hail.

58
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:34,000
'Today is a day of great celebrations
for the people of Debnaagr.'

59
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,416
'On one side, their dear
leader has won today.'

60
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,000
'And on the other side,
it is his birthday today.'

61
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,583
Hail Debraj.
- Hail.

62
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,250
Hail Debraj.
- Hail.

63
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,083
What is he doing here again?

64
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,583
Hey! Go and throw him out.

65
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,083
Hey..
- Hey! Stop.

66
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:02,916
No one will do anything.
Let him come here.

67
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:08,458
Happy birthday! God of Debnagar.

68
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,833
Thank you.

69
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,958
There has been change in the state.

70
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:18,208
And hence, I have
changed my path as well.

71
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:23,166
I have locked up all the
illegal business that I had.

72
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,333
Good to hear that, Apurbo.

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,208
Although you are late it is
enough that you have understood.

74
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:33,375
One can achieve a lot
more by loving people..

75
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,291
..than by ruining them.

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,166
Come on. Have some sweets.

77
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,500
You are asking me to have sweets?

78
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,083
And your boys want to tear me off..

79
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:47,458
..and hence giving off fake smiles.

80
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,208
I will come some other time and
have food to my heart's content.

81
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,875
Have fun!

82
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,708
Don't trust this man, Debda.

83
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,291
He is like a snake.

84
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,500
Keshto.

85
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,166
Father used to say
that a guest is like God.

86
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,708
If the guest is an enemy..

87
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,083
..respect him if he comes home.

88
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:13,250
Do you know what my
father used to say?

89
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,583
He said that I have evil in my eyes.

90
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,666
Whichever place I go to..

91
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,208
..turns into a graveyard.

92
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,458
And the ones I lay my eyes on..

93
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:22,791
..becomes a dead body.

94
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:29,125
"Happy birthday to you."

95
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:32,416
"Happy birthday to you."

96
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,208
Come on, fast, fast. Here you are.

97
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:40,041
"Happy birthday to you."

98
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:44,125
"Happy birthday to you."

99
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:48,541
"Happy birthday to brother."

100
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,708
What is all this
that you have started?

101
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:57,750
Abhi wanted to do something
special for your birthday, Debda.

102
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:58,833
Yes, brother.

103
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,083
Abhi wanted to
present his mother to you..

104
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,166
..on this happy day.

105
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,125
And hence, take a look, brother.

106
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,625
Although it is a picture..

107
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,166
..he has got his
mother as a present for you.

108
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,125
Uncle, will you play badminton?

109
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,916
Why? Don't you have school today?
- Yes.

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,125
Where is your school bag?

111
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,666
I have given it to Sidhu?
- Meaning?

112
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,083
He didn't have books to study.

113
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:28,041
That is why I gave my books to him.
- I see.

114
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,083
No.

115
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,125
I don't think what I
thought would happen.

116
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,625
I don't think there is a
slightest possibility..

117
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,958
..of your son becoming a
doctor or an engineer.

118
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,750
I don't have any interest in knowing..

119
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,666
..whether he is a doctor or engineer.

120
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,833
He should just help people.

121
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,416
People should love him.

122
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,416
Father.

123
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,833
Sidhu doesn't have books.

124
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,750
He hasn't been able to
pay the school fees too.

125
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,958
That is why Bablu
was making fun of him.

126
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,958
I felt very angry and I slapped Bablu.

127
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:00,333
Sir scolded me and said that
I don't care about anything.

128
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,458
Tell me, father.

129
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,041
What is the meaning of
not caring about anything?

130
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,041
Is it good or bad?

131
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,625
Not caring about anything would mean..

132
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,625
..one who doesn't care about anyone.

133
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,916
He does what feels is right.

134
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,291
He holds truth close to him.

135
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,791
And keeps injustice under his feet.

136
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:23,166
Don't let this
quality in you die away.

137
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,791
This is your challenge.
This is your character.

138
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,625
Come on, Anshu, we have to go out.

139
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:32,458
Come on.

140
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,041
Bye, father.
- Goddess, hail. - Bye.

141
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:38,875
Brother.
- Yes?

142
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,666
Are you sending Abhi to the hostel?

143
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:46,541
Let me see. But I don't think
he will be able to without us.

144
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,708
He will do something in
two days and come back.

145
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,375
'Mumbai's dangerous don.'

146
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,708
'Underworld king, Gurunayak Singh.'

147
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:27,916
'The cops are under
pressure to arrest him.'

148
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,250
'Arms, drugs, contract killings..'

149
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:33,666
'..extortions. All of
these are his forte.'

150
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,041
'Gurunayak and his
brother are spreading terror..'

151
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:39,500
'..in India and South East
Asia's four countries regularly.'

152
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,875
Sir, you had made a special
task force to arrest Guru Nayak.

153
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,583
What happened to it?
It has been a year.

154
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,250
We are on the job. This
case will be solved very soon.

155
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,916
Look. They are showing your father.

156
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,750
Sir, you have been saying
the same thing for a year.

157
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,500
So what do you want to hear?
Want to hear something new?

158
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,916
Yes.
- Yes. So write down.

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,500
Police department inefficient. Happy?

160
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,750
This is our police department.

161
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:01,916
MB news.

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,041
Father, look, they are
speaking rubbish about you on T.V.

163
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,791
Don't you feel bad at all?

164
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:14,208
It is true that we haven't
been much useful as of now.

165
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,166
Father.

166
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,291
Wouldn't you be able to
arrest that mean man ever?

167
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,041
We will definitely
be able to arrest him.

168
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,583
Till date, there has
been no criminal..

169
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,708
..who has been allowed to go
scot free after committing a crime.

170
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,041
In order to finish a criminal..

171
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,541
..we need a man who
doesn't have a care in the world.

172
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,166
He should have an attack like a
cheetah and a lion on the enemy.

173
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,541
It is not his mission
to finish criminals.

174
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,416
It is his passion.

175
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,666
He is a force in himself.

176
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,250
"What is up? What say?"

177
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,041
"What is up? What say?"

178
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:58,250
"Challenge."

179
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:02,000
"Challenge."

180
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:14,916
"He has got the challenge, guys."

181
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,666
"He is going to rock you."

182
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,708
"He is going to move you."

183
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,833
"He is going to rock you."

184
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,083
"Yes."

185
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,208
Hey, you!

186
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,875
Why are you looking
that side? Look here.

187
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,166
Absolutely fresh.

188
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,833
Hey!

189
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,375
Hey, fool, I will
set the question paper.

190
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:08,125
And all of you will give the answers.

191
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,416
Brother, he seems like a cop.

192
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,458
Oh no, I think this fool was born..

193
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,958
..within half a kilometer
from the police station.

194
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,041
On just getting one slap..

195
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,041
..he understood who I am.

196
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,416
Yes.

197
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,625
Police.

198
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,375
This is a market, sir.

199
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,208
Everything is sold here.
Even the police.

200
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,291
The one who gets
sold gets a promotion.

201
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,208
And one who doesn't get sold is dead.

202
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,708
Hey!

203
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,708
All the things that you have sold
and bought till date are merely..

204
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,750
..some useless vegetables
in the garden of the cops.

205
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,166
I am of a different kind. High breed.

206
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,833
Do you know people of
my department call me?

207
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,500
Tiger!

208
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,041
Royal Bengal Tiger.

209
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,916
When people hear that I have
come down to the streets..

210
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,041
..in the hospitals,
morgues and graveyards..

211
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,958
There is a house full
board hung everywhere.

212
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,500
Hey, listen!
- Yes?

213
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,083
How was the dialogue?

214
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,208
The public will be very impressed,
brother. - Really?

215
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,375
Another wicket down.

216
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,083
What do you want?
- The train is on the line now.

217
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,083
Guru Talwar.

218
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,750
Tell me, where is he?

219
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,333
Whenever Guru comes to Mumbai..

220
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,791
..he stays with Sunny Supari.

221
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,250
Birju.

222
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:23,750
Ever since your birth..

223
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,625
..your father never ever trusted you.

224
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,041
How can I trust you?

225
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:30,625
I am telling the truth.
I swear. Leave me.

226
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,666
Okay, fine, we will meet again.

227
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,083
Hey!
- Birju.

228
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,125
Do you think my father used to say?

229
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,875
He said that we can know
the way if we have the eyes.

230
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:47,625
And if we have brains..

231
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,333
..we can know how many
potholes are there on this path.

232
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,375
Hey!

233
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,500
Challenge.

234
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,291
Sir, without counting
the doors and windows..

235
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,458
..inside the house
while standing here..

236
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,125
..we should attack.

237
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:11,458
Do I need to learn from you about
what is right and what is wrong?

238
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,541
And who told you that I am
counting the doors and windows inside?

239
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,708
I am confirming whether
Guru Talwar is inside or not.

240
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,625
Sir, I have
confirmed news. He is inside.

241
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,708
Whatever you hear is not information.

242
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,500
What you see with your
eyes is the confirmation.

243
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,750
So what if my father named
me as Madhusudan Bakshi?

244
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,041
I am Byomkesh
Bakshi(detective) in my heart.

245
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,708
Sir, you are messing up
the matter without a reason.

246
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,875
It will be a risk later if
we don't attack right away.

247
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,166
Idiot. -Yes.

248
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:39,041
Do you know the risk I have
taken in life to come here?

249
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,291
Just wait for my signal.

250
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,666
What kind of a signal, sir?

251
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,833
I will call out like a bird.

252
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,500
What if I cannot hear you?

253
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,666
I will call out aloud.

254
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,958
Sir, I think braying like
a donkey would be better.

255
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,375
That is your status.
- Sir.

256
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,750
Fool!

257
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,000
Come on.

258
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:04,291
Look, Sunny. Explain it to Afzal.

259
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,958
How can business run like this?

260
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,375
Guru is getting angry.

261
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,625
Okay, brother.

262
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,791
I will take care of that fool.

263
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,833
Shinde.
- Yes, brother.

264
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,791
None of the illegal properties
should have Guru's name on it.

265
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,041
Got it?

266
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:26,000
Today, we must not let Talwar get
out of our hands today in any way.

267
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,500
Okay?

268
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,083
There.
- Okay.

269
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,833
Joydeep. Follow me.

270
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,958
Sir asked us to wait for the signal.

271
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,708
If we wait for any longer..

272
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,916
..we would have to wait
for sir all our lives.

273
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:40,916
What is this?

274
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,041
This is not a bird
but Tarzan calling out.

275
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,541
Whatever I thought has happened! Crap!

276
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,833
Hey, fool, who are you?

277
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,041
Why have you come here?

278
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,000
Hey, why are you hitting me without
a reason? At least listen to me.

279
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,583
Tell me, fool.
- Sir, I am a real estate agent.

280
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,208
The party called me to see a house.

281
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,041
And I came here by mistake.

282
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,958
Hey, don't hit me, sir.
I have a wife and kids at home.

283
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:02,041
The story is good
but I don't believe it.

284
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,666
Hey, hey, are you a fool or an idiot?

285
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,291
Don't you have any brains?

286
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,708
Oh no! I was waiting for you
in the next house for one hour.

287
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,208
And you are sitting
here and having fun?

288
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,750
Hey! Who are you?
- Agent.

289
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,666
He has been trying to convince
me about a property for one month.

290
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,250
We were supposed to
make it final today.

291
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,208
He is not doing it and has gone
down on his knees and acting here?

292
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,541
Fake man. He is fake..
Teach him a good lesson.

293
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,125
Abhi. You cannot talk to me like this.

294
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,750
What do you think of yourself?

295
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,208
Does one talk to a
senior officer like this?

296
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,291
You are going beyond your limit.

297
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,291
I will complain to the
commissioner about you.

298
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,125
Hey fool.
- Hey!

299
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,666
Hey!

300
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,083
Hey!

301
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,791
Come on..
- Hey, let us go.

302
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:55,958
Well done, Abhi.

303
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,500
Thank you.

304
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,166
The gang member of Guru
Nayak whom you have arrested..

305
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,583
..is very useful.

306
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,791
Through him, we will be able to know..

307
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,500
..a lot about Guru Nayak's activity.

308
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,500
Well done.
- Thank you, sir.

309
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,916
Good morning, sir.
- Come on..

310
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Good morning.

311
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,791
Wait, sir. Please,
sir. Please let go of me.

312
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,083
What happened to you now, Mr. Bakshi?

313
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,041
Bullet on, sir.

314
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,958
Didn't they get any other spot?

315
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,625
Not them, sir.

316
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:23,875
Even if they are the
members of the mafia..

317
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:24,833
..they have a sense of location.

318
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,166
They are not
nonsensical like our department.

319
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,333
If I would have shot
without avoiding it..

320
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,666
..they would have killed you.

321
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,958
Hey, don't talk nonsense.

322
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,208
Before they started shooting..

323
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,416
..the things that you told me..

324
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,791
..were more dangerous wounds for me.

325
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,416
I didn't have any
better option to save you.

326
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,625
Wow..
- Here he is.

327
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,166
He is my son-in-law..
- Hey, listen.

328
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,666
He feels so much for me..
- Hey, police Gupta.

329
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,291
I will come again.
I wouldn't spare you.

330
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:50,750
Did you see that, sir?

331
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,541
Did you see how
he shot that man like a dog?

332
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:54,791
Not like a dog.

333
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,333
I shot a dog.

334
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,375
There is no control on him.

335
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,791
If you don't change your behavior..

336
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,500
..you wouldn't be able to stick
around in the police department.

337
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,958
If the police doesn't stop bothering..

338
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:08,958
..there wouldn't be any difference
between a cop and a shopkeeper.

339
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,583
Crime is a spin for me.

340
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,833
And criminal is web for me.

341
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:21,750
And to clean this
system is my challenge.

342
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:44,583
"Go home. Kid, go home."

343
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,875
"If you have guts,
come and fight with me."

344
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,291
"If you want to achieve it, do it."

345
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,541
"Don't go, fool."

346
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,625
"He doesn't bother about anyone."

347
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,833
"He will burn you into ashes."

348
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,375
"By crushing someone's
shadow under his feet."

349
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,833
"Don't go, fool."

350
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,208
"Don't run away, fool."

351
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,250
"Challenge."

352
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,291
"Don't give it to me, fool."

353
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,500
"Challenge."

354
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,625
"Don't take it, fool."

355
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:14,833
"Challenge."

356
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,291
"Don't give it to me, fool."

357
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,916
"Don't take it, fool."

358
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,541
"Don't take it, fool."

359
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,833
"Don't run away, fool."

360
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,666
"Understand when I am
telling you in Bengali."

361
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,416
"You will be finished."

362
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:33,125
"You will understand when
you come to mess with me."

363
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:36,083
"I am some other dangerous thing."

364
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,041
"Hey take care of what you are doing."

365
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,666
"Measure your words."

366
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,291
"Hey, run away."

367
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,083
"Hey, taste defeat."

368
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,166
"Challenge."

369
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,333
"Don't give it to me, fool."

370
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,375
"Challenge."

371
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,500
"Don't take it, fool."

372
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:50,708
"Challenge."

373
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,208
"Don't give it to me, fool."

374
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,791
"Don't take it, fool."

375
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,375
"Don't take it, fool."

376
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,916
"Don't run away, fool."

377
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,958
"When you walk on an
unknown path, he can be found."

378
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,083
"Everyone looks for him in a problem."

379
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:19,208
"He has a lot of courage.
He alone can achieve a lot."

380
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:22,250
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."

381
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,250
"Challenge."

382
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,541
"Don't give it to me, fool."

383
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,583
"Challenge."

384
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,750
"Don't take it, fool."

385
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:29,833
"Challenge."

386
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,375
"Don't give it to me, fool."

387
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,916
"Don't take it, fool."

388
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,583
"Don't take it, fool."

389
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,875
"Don't run away, fool."

390
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:11,500
"Because of small matters.."

391
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:15,083
"..the blood of his feet goes up
to his head and makes him angry."

392
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:20,250
"Walk properly with me, brother."

393
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:24,708
"Even if there is a small problem.."

394
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:28,083
"..you will be caught
and get into a problem."

395
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:32,708
"You will vanish into thin
air if I come in front of you."

396
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:35,208
"Challenge."

397
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,500
"Don't give it to me, fool."

398
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:38,500
"Challenge."

399
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,833
"Don't take it, fool."

400
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:41,875
"Challenge."

401
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:43,416
"Don't give it to me, fool."

402
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,958
"Don't take it, fool."

403
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,500
"Don't take it, fool."

404
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:47,791
"Don't run away, fool."

405
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,750
"Go home. Kid, go home."

406
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:54,041
"If you have guts,
come and fight with me."

407
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,416
"If you want to achieve it, do it."

408
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,666
"Don't go, fool."

409
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:04,000
"He doesn't bother about anyone."

410
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:07,041
"He will burn you into ashes."

411
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:09,500
"By crushing someone's
shadow under his feet."

412
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:11,125
"Don't go, fool."

413
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:12,666
"Don't run away, fool."

414
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,166
"Don't go, fool."

415
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:16,083
"Challenge."

416
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:18,375
"Don't give it to me, fool."

417
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:19,375
"Challenge."

418
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,250
"Don't take it, fool."

419
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:22,750
"Challenge."

420
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,250
"Don't give it to me, fool."

421
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:25,791
"Don't take it, fool."

422
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,333
"Don't take it, fool."

423
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:29,458
"Hey, don't give it, fool."

424
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,041
Challenge!

425
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:32,625
"Don't take it, fool."

426
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,458
Hi, brother.
- Hi, Pat.

427
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:02,041
Hello, who is it?

428
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:05,125
Nayak. Guru Nayak.

429
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:08,833
I killed him because he
committed a mistake once.

430
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,541
He was my old aide.

431
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:12,125
He was very dear to me.

432
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:14,750
Wash your hands
properly after veneration.

433
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,125
If you touch something else..

434
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,166
..the place will remain the same.

435
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,125
The corpse will change.

436
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:36,791
No, sir, he didn't die. He was killed.

437
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,625
If Guru Talwar was
killed in the police lock up..

438
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,833
..it is proved that our
department has their men.

439
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:46,333
But they were a little
late in killing Guru Talwar.

440
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:49,125
Meaning? What do you want to say?

441
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:01,750
Hey Pawar, what will happen
if we give it on 180 degrees?

442
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,666
Sir, in that case, he will die.

443
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,250
What is the point of
keeping him alive?

444
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:08,958
In any case, he has
decided he wouldn't say anything.

445
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:11,416
Sir has to be bathed and then fed.

446
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,750
Then he has to be taken to the court.

447
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:16,791
The petrol will be burnt
uselessly and time will be wasted.

448
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:22,708
It would be better
if we killed him here.

449
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:26,458
I will tell you. I will tell you.

450
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,041
Speak.

451
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:31,333
No one knows about the
address of Guru Bhai.

452
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:32,875
His younger brother..

453
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:36,166
His younger brother, Bunty,
maintains contact with everyone.

454
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,625
Where can we find that fool?

455
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:39,041
I don't know.

456
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:40,583
I don't know.

457
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,208
But he..

458
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:46,750
He goes to Malaysia to
meet his girlfriend at times.

459
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:51,833
We cannot disclose this
news in front of the media.

460
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,041
And yet we have to tell them
something so that they can make news.

461
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:58,458
Suspend. You have to suspend us, sir.
- What?

462
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:00,041
Yes, sir.

463
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:02,666
At that time, we will look for Bunty,
Guru Nayak's brother.

464
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:05,083
Before that, we have to
feed the news of our..

465
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:06,875
..suspension to the media.

466
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:10,166
Everyone must know
that we are inefficient.

467
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:15,291
The police officers in charge of
this case have been suspended.

468
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:18,333
We are carrying on the
investigation with a special officer.

469
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:20,958
If these officers are
found to be ineffective..

470
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,041
..then we will take
steps to punish them.

471
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:24,916
Yes.
- This is great.

472
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,458
This is great.
- Superb!

473
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:27,875
This is great..
- Yes, it is fun.

474
00:26:27,916 --> 00:26:29,333
Party. This is fun.
- So much of fun!

475
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:30,333
Hey, brother.

476
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:33,125
Brother. Let us enjoy.
Let us have champagne.

477
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:37,041
Oh no. I am bored of winning.

478
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:39,291
Unless I get an attack
from the opposite direction..

479
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:41,166
..heart, lungs, kidney..

480
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,208
..don't seem to exist anymore.

481
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:45,958
Isn't there a single person in
the whole of police department..

482
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,333
..who can challenge Guru Nayak?

483
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:50,083
Heads.
- Yes.

484
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,333
Get ready, guys.

485
00:26:57,125 --> 00:26:58,208
With our lives at risk..

486
00:26:58,291 --> 00:26:59,791
..we have done a lot for this country.

487
00:26:59,916 --> 00:27:01,583
Every time, we have been successful.

488
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,625
But this time, the
mission is a little different.

489
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:07,041
But we have gone on a serious
mission like this many times, Abhi.

490
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,375
What is the difference?

491
00:27:08,916 --> 00:27:10,916
This time, the criminal is
the teacher of all criminals.

492
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,500
Guru Nayak.

493
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:13,375
Where is he?

494
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,375
I think he is in some
warehouse somewhere around.

495
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:16,583
I have news that
Guru Nayak's brother..

496
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:17,708
..Bunty is in Malaysia at the moment.

497
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:20,583
So operation Malaysia.

498
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:43,791
Raj. What is this? What is happening?

499
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:44,416
A single..

500
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,583
Not a single piece of
information is right.

501
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:46,791
All the information is wrong.

502
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:47,375
Abhi!

503
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,166
We have got it.
- What?

504
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,291
The girl stays in Cool stone.

505
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:50,541
What?

506
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:51,666
Imphat Latulima.

507
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,541
What do you mean?

508
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:54,166
4 or 5..

509
00:27:57,916 --> 00:27:59,083
Amzad Bhai.

510
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:24,875
Thank you, Amzad Bhai.
- Thank you.

511
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:26,208
Thank you.
- Bye.

512
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:28,666
Come on.
- Come on.

513
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,541
What next?

514
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,041
We have keep a watch on the egg.

515
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:42,500
Till the egg doesn't burst
and the girl doesn't come out.

516
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:51,541
How would we know which girl is
the one among so many of them?

517
00:28:52,541 --> 00:28:53,833
She is not amongst all of these.

518
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,083
How did you understand?

519
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:57,416
The girl is Bunty's girlfriend.

520
00:28:57,666 --> 00:29:01,416
A booked girl never gives a
flying kiss to someone else.

521
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:04,583
But yes, the girl will come.
She will come after two days.

522
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:05,833
As soon as the planets are in favor..

523
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:07,000
..she will come.

524
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:08,375
Do something.
- What?

525
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:09,916
Leave the job of a cop..

526
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,666
..and join a T.V
channel as an astrologer.

527
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,000
Yes, priest Joydeb Shastri.

528
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:17,166
At the moment, tell me,
what is there in me destiny?

529
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:18,916
Will I find the girl or not?

530
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,083
You will find her.
But some other girl.

531
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:23,750
Not hate story. Love story.

532
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:25,833
She will come in front of you..

533
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:27,458
..and she will stay as your housewife.

534
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,041
Can you speak less rubbish?
Focus on the job at hand.

535
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:51,583
Excuse me, are you
looking for someone?

536
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:53,875
Yes.
- He is the only one.

537
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:55,333
Stupid.

538
00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:57,958
Hey, stupid..
- Hey!

539
00:29:58,083 --> 00:29:59,375
Your calculations were wrong.

540
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:01,166
Hey, what rubbish are you talking?

541
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,291
Everything that I am
saying cannot happen just now.

542
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:04,916
The prediction will be
done at the beginning.

543
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:07,166
And then, confirmation.

544
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:09,500
And then, conclusion.

545
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:12,500
Yes, Amzad Bhai. Yes,
yes. May Lord be with you.

546
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:14,083
I will reach. Sure.

547
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,208
Listen. Amzad Bhai has called me.
He wants to share some information.

548
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:18,625
Okay?

549
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:19,250
Shall we come with you?

550
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:20,875
No, no, there is no
need for you to go.

551
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:22,541
You can do something.

552
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:24,666
Yes. Go to the terrace and
keep an eye on your surroundings.

553
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,791
Okay? We will meet again.

554
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:30,791
Keep an eye.

555
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,333
Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?

556
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:52,833
May I help you?

557
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:55,833
Pack this one for me.
- This?

558
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:58,166
Hey!

559
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:12,166
No, no, human beings
can make mistakes.

560
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,791
But planets can never make a mistake.

561
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:18,125
Hey, I made
calculations last night again.

562
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:21,458
If the Jupiter comes
into your life once..

563
00:31:21,541 --> 00:31:24,000
..the girl will be
fixed in your life forever.

564
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:26,416
Abhi. The girl.

565
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:40,541
Why is she here?
- For Bunty.

566
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:49,000
Hey!

567
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,750
This is a mess.

568
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:52,791
Actually these are about planets.

569
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:54,166
They keep on moving all the time.

570
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,458
And hence anything
might happen anytime.

571
00:31:57,041 --> 00:32:00,833
Bunty and his girlfriend will be
finished by me in a single bullet.

572
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,791
Have you seen how much
shopping she has done?

573
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,541
Everything has been
earned by cheating the public.

574
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:11,708
The husband is killing
and his wife is spending.

575
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:14,708
Keep silent. I think
she is coming this side.

576
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:16,375
What is your problem?

577
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:17,166
Me?

578
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,208
Yes, you.

579
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:20,250
Why are you guys following me?

580
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:22,958
Now we.. - I think this girl
doesn't understand Bengali, okay?

581
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,750
Take this girl into a loop in Bengali.

582
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:26,500
Now..
- Excuse me.

583
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:28,750
I know all the letters of Bengali.
- What?

584
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:29,958
So what if you know? Yes?

585
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,625
We are not following you at all.

586
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,250
We have come to have coke.
- Yes.

587
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:34,833
Don't try to hide your face with coke.

588
00:32:34,916 --> 00:32:38,416
And boys like you can be
judged only by one look.

589
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,958
And boys are of two types.

590
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,208
Type One.

591
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:44,083
They keep on following
girls if they see a pretty one.

592
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:45,250
If she gets impressed, it is fine.

593
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,208
Or else, they will start
following a girl again.

594
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:50,250
Type two. If a boy likes a girl..

595
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:51,791
..he will go and tell her directly.

596
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,666
I respect boys like that.
Not fools like you.

597
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,708
Hey! What do you think of yourself?

598
00:32:58,125 --> 00:32:59,333
A high rise building?

599
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:00,500
And I am slum dwelling?

600
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:01,791
Have you seen me from top to bottom?

601
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:03,708
Do I seem like a fool to you?

602
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:07,666
Now you explained us a lot
about Type One and Type Two.

603
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:09,208
You don't have a type at all.

604
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:10,250
Just shut up, okay?

605
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:11,125
You shut up. Okay?

606
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:12,166
Hey..
- I will box your nose.

607
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,416
Hey!
- How dare..

608
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,750
Now staying in a seven star
hotel and all this shopping.. - Hey..

609
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:17,125
All this make up and all.
- Hey..

610
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:18,375
Where do you get all
this money from? Yes?

611
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:20,291
That is none of your business..
- Now, listen..

612
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:21,375
Hey, I know about
your business very well.

613
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:22,958
Now listen..
- And who is behind this business?

614
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:23,791
And who is behind him?

615
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:24,958
I know everything.

616
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:27,750
Look..
- I will uproot your entire family.

617
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:29,791
Get lost.
- You get lost.

618
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:31,333
Hey!
- Hey, hey, sit down.

619
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:35,250
Fool! If I could box her nose once..

620
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:37,083
..she would have been dead right away.

621
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:39,791
Hey, listen. I don't
care if we lose Bunty.

622
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,041
But I am not letting go of this girl.

623
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:43,458
You are taking this matter personally.

624
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:44,458
Hey, forget it. Personally indeed.

625
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:44,958
Okay.

626
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:46,375
Understand what I am saying..
- Your bill, sir.

627
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,375
How much?
- This is strange.

628
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:49,625
Impha Tulima.
- What?

629
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:51,916
Hey, same. The room
number of the girl.

630
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,333
405.
- I see.

631
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:55,458
No, it is 505.
- Thanks.

632
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:57,750
505?

633
00:33:57,958 --> 00:34:01,000
What? - That means that the
girl is not Bunty's girlfriend?

634
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:04,041
Bunty's girlfriend stays in 505.

635
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,416
That is what calculation says.

636
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,875
Hey, do something.

637
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:09,083
Go to the hotel and
keep an eye on the girl.

638
00:34:09,666 --> 00:34:11,708
In the meanwhile,
I will go and meet Amzad Bhai.

639
00:34:11,791 --> 00:34:12,666
Come on, bye, we will meet.

640
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,750
What?

641
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:17,000
Where did the girl go?

642
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:18,000
Strange!
- Mother.

643
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:19,750
Hey, here you are. Where
were you all this while?

644
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:22,791
Oh no. I was thinking of getting on
to the boat since such a long time.

645
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:25,500
Mom! Not boat. Ferry.

646
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:27,750
Hey, dear, okay, okay.

647
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:28,750
It is English after all.

648
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,041
So what if I am late?

649
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:31,000
Come on, we will go now.

650
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:31,458
Yes, let us go.
- Come on.

651
00:34:31,541 --> 00:34:32,458
Yes, come on.
- Come on.

652
00:34:39,666 --> 00:34:40,458
Oh no.

653
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:42,500
Ferry. Ferry. Very bad.

654
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:44,041
There is not a single boat here.

655
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:47,041
Mother, it is all because
of sister. She missed it.

656
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Hi, ma'am. Abhiraj Rai.

657
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:53,000
My name.
- I see. You are Bengali?

658
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:54,000
Yes.

659
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:55,541
I am Joyita. I am of the same caste.

660
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:58,750
What a beautiful name
you have. Very nice.

661
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:01,333
Thank you. Thank you.
My younger daughter.

662
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:02,000
Srija.
- Hi.

663
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,541
Hi.

664
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,166
My elder daughter. Puja..
- No, no, no, let it be.

665
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:06,541
Puja.. - Quiet. She is
clicking pictures, right?

666
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:08,166
Let her. There is no
point in disturbing her.

667
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,958
By the way, your name is very nice.

668
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:12,833
If you shorten it a bit,
it will be Joey.

669
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:14,833
Do you know something?

670
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:17,541
Even her father used to shorten
it and call me like that earlier.

671
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:20,125
He used to say that
Joey is very sweet.

672
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:21,375
Really?

673
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:22,791
Anyway, are you here for holidays?

674
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:23,541
No, no, no, no.

675
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:24,500
Fashion show.

676
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:26,666
My elder daughter Puja..
- Yes, yes.

677
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,750
She is a fashion designer.

678
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:29,458
I see. Really?
- Yes.

679
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:33,958
In that Cranton hotel, she has
designed the clothes for everyone.

680
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:35,291
Her clothes have been..
- What are you doing here?

681
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,916
Puja..
- Puja?

682
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:38,375
He..
- Mother, you have told him my name?

683
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:41,541
No, no, not just the name. She has
told me a lot of other things too.

684
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:46,625
Anyway, just forget
whatever happened between us.

685
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:47,583
What happened?
- He..

686
00:35:47,666 --> 00:35:48,666
Misunderstanding.

687
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,208
Try to understand a bit.

688
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:51,583
Hey, even I am..

689
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:52,333
Type Two.

690
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:53,291
Hey, you are fraud?

691
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:55,625
Mother..
- Even your daughter is like that.

692
00:35:55,666 --> 00:35:58,708
Mom..
- Mom, I think they know each other.

693
00:35:58,791 --> 00:36:01,000
Yes? - Such a small girl
has such a sharp brain.

694
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:03,625
Yes, she is my daughter.. - So what
if she is of the same blood group?

695
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:05,916
I have to agree, boss.
- Yes.

696
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:07,083
Mother, please let us go from here.

697
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:08,250
Hey..
- Hey, aunt. Aunt!

698
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,750
Just let him say what he came to say.
- Hey!

699
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:11,333
The girl has gone away.

700
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:12,500
When you lose your chance once..

701
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:13,416
..you don't get it back. Yes.

702
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,458
Now suffer the consequences.

703
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:17,458
Hey, you. Everything has
happened because of you. - What?

704
00:36:17,541 --> 00:36:18,958
You understand local language, right?
- Yes.

705
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,791
You said 405 instead of 505..

706
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:22,833
..and got me into a mess.
- Hey!

707
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:25,875
I..
- Because of this, I lost Puja too.

708
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:27,416
How did you know that
the girl's name is Puja?

709
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,416
Your father told me.

710
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:31,541
Abhi. Bunty's girlfriend. Have a look.

711
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:42,583
You have seen the target.
Now your focus should be on her.

712
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:44,833
Yes, I am reaching over there.

713
00:36:46,625 --> 00:36:47,916
Yes, of course.

714
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:50,333
Hey, leave me.
- No, no, not that.

715
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,208
Leave me. The girl is going.

716
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:53,750
Leave me..
- Anyway, I will be there.

717
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,750
You are here?

718
00:36:57,833 --> 00:36:59,166
As soon as you didn't get me..

719
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,500
..you started
running after other girls?

720
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:02,875
Hey..

721
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:04,833
You and she are completely different.

722
00:37:04,875 --> 00:37:06,375
Character is different
and the story is different.

723
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:09,375
But for me, your character
and story have become clear.

724
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:10,875
Come on.

725
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:16,750
Why is the wheel moving in
the wrong direction? Tell me.

726
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:19,708
How can the wheel be wrong
if the radial has a problem?

727
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:21,375
Tell her the truth.

728
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,166
Will she believe me?

729
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,625
If I tell her, she will think
I am telling her another lie.

730
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:29,125
Take a chance once. The
planets are in transit.

731
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:33,416
Got it? If it has to happen,
it might happen.

732
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,708
Yes.
- Really?

733
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,041
Puja.

734
00:37:37,416 --> 00:37:38,083
Hi.

735
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:39,333
You are still following me?
- I..

736
00:37:39,416 --> 00:37:40,125
How dare you?

737
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,416
I will call the police..

738
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,875
Low. Keep your volume low.

739
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:43,791
Don't shout, please.

740
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:46,000
I am an officer of the
crime branch of Mumbai police.

741
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:48,375
I have come here to
look for a criminal.

742
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:50,958
The girl I was
following a while back..

743
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:52,041
..is his girlfriend.

744
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:55,833
In fact, I made a mistake and
thought of you as his girlfriend.

745
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:58,416
That is why I shouted at you. Sorry.

746
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,500
And from the time
I have come to know the truth..

747
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:05,041
..I have fallen all the more for you.

748
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:07,916
For as many times
I wanted to explain it to you..

749
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:09,125
..there has been some or the problem.

750
00:38:09,208 --> 00:38:11,958
This is my last chance.
I have told you everything.

751
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,125
I am sure you have understood.

752
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,583
Now you can do
whatever you feel is right.

753
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:52,000
"With one kiss."

754
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:53,708
"You gave me an electric shock."

755
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:55,416
"With two kisses."

756
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,458
"You increased the voltage."

757
00:38:57,458 --> 00:39:01,041
"Give me three kisses."

758
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:04,375
"The temperature has gone high."

759
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:08,000
"I have got the fever of love."

760
00:39:08,083 --> 00:39:11,250
"I have got the fever of love."

761
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:15,500
"I have got the fever of love."

762
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,166
"With one kiss."

763
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:21,041
"You gave me an electric shock."

764
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,791
"With two kisses."

765
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:24,666
"You increased the voltage."

766
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:28,166
"Give me three kisses."

767
00:39:28,291 --> 00:39:31,875
"The temperature has gone high."

768
00:39:31,958 --> 00:39:34,791
"I have got the fever of love."

769
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:38,333
"I have got the fever of love."

770
00:39:38,416 --> 00:39:43,208
"I have got the fever of love."

771
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,041
"You gave me the
fever without a reason."

772
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:02,875
"What is the solution now?"

773
00:40:02,916 --> 00:40:04,916
"Without the wet
cloth on my forehead.."

774
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,708
"..my heart is burning."

775
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:12,083
"You gave me the
fever without a reason."

776
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:13,833
"What is the solution now?"

777
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:15,666
"Without the wet
cloth on my forehead.."

778
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,541
"..my heart is burning."

779
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:19,291
"There is a problem."

780
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,166
"My heart is dancing."

781
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:24,875
"I will sing a duet with you.
I will not stay alone."

782
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,458
"My heart is unwell."

783
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:31,708
"Get the thermometer."

784
00:40:31,916 --> 00:40:33,291
"I have."

785
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:34,166
"I have."

786
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:37,083
"I have got the fever of love."

787
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:40,583
"I have got the fever of love."

788
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:45,000
"I have got the fever of love."

789
00:41:04,666 --> 00:41:08,208
"Please don't play
with my heart anymore."

790
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:11,833
"Come and give me a tonic and
make me free from this fever."

791
00:41:11,958 --> 00:41:15,500
"You gave three kisses for free.
Give me one more."

792
00:41:15,583 --> 00:41:19,375
"In this mess of love,
I am rendered useless."

793
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:22,750
"Don't try to play hard to get."

794
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:26,500
"Take care of my heart."

795
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:27,583
"I have."

796
00:41:27,666 --> 00:41:28,541
"I have."

797
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:31,333
"I have got the fever of love."

798
00:41:31,416 --> 00:41:34,833
"I have got the fever of love."

799
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:39,458
"I have got the fever of love."

800
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,458
Crap!

801
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:54,166
Sister, why are you so tensed?

802
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,666
It is the presentation of
such a big fashion designer.

803
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,333
I hope everything happens on time.

804
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:01,166
Sister, you are wrong.
- Oh no, my bag?

805
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:02,458
Where is my bag?

806
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,875
Oh crap!

807
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:06,208
I left it back at the station.

808
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:08,791
Oh my God.

809
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:16,791
Crap. The bag was here, right?

810
00:42:16,833 --> 00:42:18,208
Yes, it was.

811
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:23,041
Crap. All my hard
work has gone to waste.

812
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:27,291
Sister, come..
- I had lied to father, right?

813
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:31,250
That is why I have been punished.

814
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:39,208
Are you here to have fun?

815
00:42:40,916 --> 00:42:42,958
I have come to give your smile back.

816
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:48,958
Do you know what people say
about me in the department?

817
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:51,666
If I give something to someone..

818
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:53,958
..that particular thing
becomes lucky for them.

819
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,125
I am giving your bag to you.

820
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:02,041
You will see that all
your dreams will come true.

821
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:04,208
Okay? All the best.

822
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:21,083
Hi, come up.

823
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:22,750
Hi, baby.

824
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:24,125
Abhi.
- Tell me.

825
00:43:24,208 --> 00:43:25,333
Bunty!

826
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:33,041
Hey baby.
- Hey baby!

827
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:34,875
Love you, baby.
- I love you too.

828
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:37,666
What is it? Do you
take so long to come?

829
00:43:38,541 --> 00:43:40,041
Do you know how long
I have been waiting for you?

830
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:40,833
Hey!

831
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:42,750
Who the hell are you? Hey!

832
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:45,083
What do you think? Marriage registrar?

833
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:46,750
I am sitting here to
get you married, Bunty?

834
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,458
Police!

835
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,375
Let go. Let go of me. Let go.

836
00:45:42,583 --> 00:45:43,833
Take the call.

837
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:45,125
Take the call.

838
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:46,833
Yes, yes, yes.

839
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:50,000
Oh no.

840
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:53,125
What is it? Is your weekend over?

841
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,333
Hey you.

842
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,625
Before the weekend started..

843
00:45:57,041 --> 00:45:58,833
..your brother has
reached his life's end.

844
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:01,916
Hey, hey, who is this?
- Police.

845
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:07,166
You have invited trouble by killing
Guru Talwar in police custody.

846
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:11,666
I have come to see the
size of that trouble.

847
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:14,125
The whole department of
police cannot touch me. Hey!

848
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:15,416
So food, how can you touch me? Yes?

849
00:46:15,583 --> 00:46:16,916
Hey fool!

850
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,458
Inviting each person is like
calling trouble for your own self.

851
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:25,250
And I am like a
whole bunch of troubles.

852
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:26,958
Hey, hey! Hey, where is Bunty?

853
00:46:27,041 --> 00:46:28,250
Where is Bunty?

854
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:32,375
At my gunpoint. Come on, recite
some religious paragraphs for him.

855
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,458
Brother, save me. He will
kill me. Brother, save me.

856
00:46:36,583 --> 00:46:38,333
Hey, Bunty brother.
Nothing will happen to you.

857
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:41,666
Don't worry at all. He is
just trying to scare you.

858
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:43,666
That fool cannot do anything.

859
00:46:46,208 --> 00:46:48,000
Now let him pray and die.

860
00:46:48,541 --> 00:46:49,708
Here you are.

861
00:46:49,791 --> 00:46:51,833
Hey, don't kill him. Don't kill him.

862
00:46:51,916 --> 00:46:54,375
If I fix a target once..

863
00:46:55,166 --> 00:46:57,125
..he doesn't go home.

864
00:46:57,916 --> 00:47:00,375
They reach the God of death's abode.

865
00:47:00,458 --> 00:47:01,958
You don't know me at all.

866
00:47:02,041 --> 00:47:04,041
Fool! I will finish you.

867
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:07,833
Hey fool! My blood group
is a little different.

868
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:10,416
If someone threatens me..

869
00:47:11,208 --> 00:47:13,833
..the blood goes up to
my head in a rapid force.

870
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:16,458
If you kill my brother..

871
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:17,916
..I will kill you
along with your family.

872
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:19,166
Say that again.

873
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:24,375
All the people that you have at
every place will be killed by me.

874
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:25,541
Speak it louder.

875
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:26,791
Speak it louder.

876
00:47:26,875 --> 00:47:29,333
I will bury you in
the ground, you swine!

877
00:47:29,416 --> 00:47:33,416
Best of luck. Bunty. Pack up.

878
00:47:35,166 --> 00:47:36,791
Bunty.

879
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:40,750
The planets are moving. Got it?

880
00:47:40,875 --> 00:47:41,625
Sister.

881
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:42,500
Abhi.

882
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:45,541
While moving..

883
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,500
Come on.
- I..

884
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:53,250
Hey, you know? Your
hands are really lucky.

885
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:55,125
My fashion show was a grand success.

886
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:56,916
Do you know how much
of applause I got?

887
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:59,666
And Srija was
clapping for a long time.

888
00:48:00,083 --> 00:48:03,208
For her and for you.

889
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:05,666
Delete me from your heart.

890
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:07,833
We won't meet anymore.

891
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:10,708
Boys are of two types. Type one.

892
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,333
They see someone.

893
00:48:12,416 --> 00:48:14,291
They loved and they said it.

894
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:16,541
Type two.

895
00:48:16,916 --> 00:48:18,958
They saw someone and fell in love.

896
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:20,458
But it took half of their life..

897
00:48:20,916 --> 00:48:22,791
..to confess about it.

898
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:25,833
I am type one.
- Actually..

899
00:48:25,875 --> 00:48:26,875
No..

900
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:28,875
We are not made for each other.

901
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:32,375
I have deleted you from my heart.

902
00:48:33,125 --> 00:48:35,041
Now you must delete me too.

903
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:36,833
Bye.

904
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:39,250
Now..

905
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:44,333
Because of your words,
everything has ended.

906
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:45,750
Nothing has ended.
- What?

907
00:48:45,833 --> 00:48:47,458
I have just started everything.

908
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:48,875
When I was walking on the right path..

909
00:48:48,958 --> 00:48:50,041
..I was facing obstacles.

910
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:51,666
Now let me walk on the reverse path.

911
00:48:52,708 --> 00:48:55,208
You will see that your
planets will talk in my favor.

912
00:48:56,375 --> 00:48:57,375
Now let us go.

913
00:48:58,583 --> 00:49:01,333
"Hail Lord."

914
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:04,000
"He is the most merciful."

915
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:06,916
"Others' sadness.."

916
00:49:10,583 --> 00:49:17,166
I have never seen him as my brother.
I have thought of him as my son.

917
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:21,125
How does the one who
killed my brother look?

918
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,041
He is absolutely rough and tough.

919
00:49:23,375 --> 00:49:25,458
He does action like a action hero.

920
00:49:25,541 --> 00:49:27,833
As soon as he came,
he started thrashing everyone.

921
00:49:27,916 --> 00:49:31,208
He looks like a Hollywood hero.

922
00:49:31,791 --> 00:49:33,541
Oh no.

923
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:35,208
Fool!

924
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:37,916
Hollywood hero can go to hell.

925
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,416
Find out the weak
point of that officer.

926
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:52,333
It has been twelve years
since Debda has left us.

927
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:55,083
But he is present. Here in my heart.

928
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:56,791
In the middle of my heart.

929
00:49:57,083 --> 00:50:00,083
With his blessings,
I have become the minister.

930
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:03,708
My life and my ministerial status..

931
00:50:03,791 --> 00:50:07,583
..have been devoted to this great man.

932
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:11,416
Debraj Rai.
- Hail.

933
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,875
Debraj Rai.
- Hail.

934
00:50:40,208 --> 00:50:41,666
Doctor!

935
00:50:47,125 --> 00:50:49,500
Abhi.
- Father.

936
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:07,958
After twelve years, your father
has come out of the coma.

937
00:51:08,041 --> 00:51:09,375
This is a miracle for us.

938
00:51:09,458 --> 00:51:11,708
But let us warn you in one matter.

939
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:15,791
The more happiness you
give to such patients..

940
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:18,333
..the faster they recover.

941
00:51:18,416 --> 00:51:21,125
If for some reason, there is
a pressure on their brain..

942
00:51:21,166 --> 00:51:23,041
..or if they are hurt..

943
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:25,458
..he can slip into coma again.

944
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:27,958
And that can be a risk on his life.

945
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:35,291
Abhi, you had faith that your
father will recover one day.

946
00:51:35,791 --> 00:51:38,291
That is why you insisted on
keeping him in the hospital.

947
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,416
God has given in to your persistence.

948
00:51:42,166 --> 00:51:45,000
But I am scared of something else.

949
00:51:45,125 --> 00:51:47,875
Debda loved ordinary people.

950
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:50,208
That is why he wanted
you to become and MLA..

951
00:51:50,291 --> 00:51:52,208
..and be with the common man.

952
00:51:52,291 --> 00:51:54,500
You will stand by
them in their problems.

953
00:51:55,708 --> 00:51:57,458
That hasn't happened.

954
00:51:58,625 --> 00:52:00,125
'I don't have any
interest in knowing..

955
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,041
..whether he is a doctor or engineer.'

956
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:04,875
'He should help people.'

957
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:08,416
'People should love him
with all their heart.'

958
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,666
And apart from that, even your
uncle passed away in that incident.

959
00:52:12,458 --> 00:52:15,875
Will he be able to
tolerate so many truths?

960
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:19,916
Father's return is the
biggest truth for me, uncle.

961
00:52:21,083 --> 00:52:24,625
And it is a challenge for me
to make this truth remain alive.

962
00:52:26,083 --> 00:52:28,041
I will go to Debnagar.

963
00:52:28,166 --> 00:52:29,583
Yes, it was me.

964
00:52:29,666 --> 00:52:32,000
I killed the owner of this house..

965
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
..and took over the
control of this house.

966
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:34,541
Yes.

967
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:38,041
Crime and ice-cream
are the same for me.

968
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:41,000
Ice-creams still have
their sticks behind.

969
00:52:41,041 --> 00:52:44,541
But I don't keep any proof
of the crimes that I commit.

970
00:52:44,625 --> 00:52:47,958
And hence, police couldn't tear
off anything that I had till date.

971
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,958
Hey, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.

972
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,625
Hey, what will they tear?

973
00:52:50,708 --> 00:52:51,458
What will they tear?

974
00:52:51,541 --> 00:52:53,958
Do you have rubbish in your head?
You don't understand anything.

975
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,541
It is not tearing off.
Not tearing off.

976
00:52:55,625 --> 00:52:56,458
It is about doing.

977
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:57,291
How many times should I tell you?

978
00:52:57,375 --> 00:52:58,458
Okay, fine, fine.

979
00:52:58,666 --> 00:52:59,375
The lip is right, isn't it?

980
00:52:59,458 --> 00:53:00,416
I will match it in the dubbing.

981
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,625
Hey, learn technology.

982
00:53:01,708 --> 00:53:03,291
Hey, you are teaching me technology?

983
00:53:03,375 --> 00:53:04,500
So you are here to teach me?

984
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:06,500
You are here to act when you don't
even have it to become a watchman?

985
00:53:06,625 --> 00:53:07,750
Get out. Get out of here..
- Hey!

986
00:53:07,833 --> 00:53:08,416
Whom are you asking to get out?

987
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,375
Whom are you asking to get out?

988
00:53:09,458 --> 00:53:11,416
You are shooting in my
house and asking me to get out?

989
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,958
Hey, pack up.
- Hey!

990
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:14,416
Fool! Do you know I the director?

991
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,791
And yet pack up.
I am the owner of this house.

992
00:53:16,875 --> 00:53:17,791
Hey..
- Hey!

993
00:53:17,875 --> 00:53:18,916
Hey..
- Hey!

994
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:19,958
Hey, call the producer.

995
00:53:20,125 --> 00:53:21,166
Hey, call the producer!

996
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:22,416
Can the producer do anything to me?

997
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,041
He is Kamal Ghosh.

998
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:25,916
He is the gold coin of film world.

999
00:53:26,166 --> 00:53:30,541
Your uncle sold this
house to his father-in-law.

1000
00:53:32,666 --> 00:53:36,041
Kamal convinced his daughter and
is now staying in a rented house.

1001
00:53:36,166 --> 00:53:37,666
But he gives the house on rent.

1002
00:53:37,791 --> 00:53:38,958
On one condition.

1003
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,875
He has to be given a role in the film.

1004
00:53:43,666 --> 00:53:45,375
Although he is useless in films..

1005
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,375
..this gold coin is
extremely useful for me.

1006
00:53:49,875 --> 00:53:51,833
I have worked in 57
movies and out of that..

1007
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:53,750
..50 have me in guest appearance.

1008
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:55,291
Who has come to do me a favor now?

1009
00:53:55,416 --> 00:53:56,500
He is here to act smart?

1010
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:57,416
What is it, Gopal?

1011
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,250
Hey, pack up!

1012
00:53:58,708 --> 00:53:59,750
I see. Babla!

1013
00:53:59,833 --> 00:54:00,708
What is the matter?

1014
00:54:00,791 --> 00:54:01,916
Instead of supplying junior artist..

1015
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:03,000
..you are all set to
launch a new hero?

1016
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:04,333
What?
- Is it?

1017
00:54:04,416 --> 00:54:06,791
No, no, he wants to
shoot at your place. - I see.

1018
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:08,333
That is why I have got him
here to talk to you. - Greetings.

1019
00:54:08,416 --> 00:54:08,916
I see.

1020
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:10,958
So are heroes looking out
for locations these days?

1021
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:12,000
He guessed it right.
- What?

1022
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:13,208
He is the hero indeed.
- Okay.

1023
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,416
He is the producer.
- Okay.

1024
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,666
And he is the director as well.

1025
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:17,041
Oh God, you have taken up so many..

1026
00:54:17,125 --> 00:54:18,333
..responsibilities at
such a young age, brother.

1027
00:54:18,416 --> 00:54:19,416
You will get spondilytis.

1028
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:20,833
Let all that be. Let him
talk about the work here.

1029
00:54:20,916 --> 00:54:21,791
So you have to tell me about the case.

1030
00:54:21,875 --> 00:54:22,500
Hey, tell him.

1031
00:54:22,583 --> 00:54:24,958
Yes.
- Do you know ex-MLA Debraj Rai?

1032
00:54:25,041 --> 00:54:26,000
Yes, I know him very well.

1033
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:27,666
This house belonged to
him at one point of time.

1034
00:54:28,416 --> 00:54:31,250
Actually my shooting is
about his life history.

1035
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:32,583
I see.

1036
00:54:32,666 --> 00:54:34,041
Don't you need to
talk about the budget?

1037
00:54:34,125 --> 00:54:35,166
Don't take any pressure.

1038
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:36,000
I have come here empty handed.

1039
00:54:36,083 --> 00:54:37,041
I will take the money
according to the situation.

1040
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:38,000
Yes.
- Oh God.

1041
00:54:38,083 --> 00:54:38,708
Hey!

1042
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:39,375
What happened?
- He did it.

1043
00:54:39,458 --> 00:54:41,083
What an amazing dialogue, sir.

1044
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:42,458
I have come empty handed..
- Yes.

1045
00:54:42,541 --> 00:54:43,958
I will take the money
according to the situation.

1046
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:45,166
Hey Babal.
- Yes?

1047
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:47,125
He is a born artist.
- Didn't I tell you so?

1048
00:54:47,208 --> 00:54:48,666
He will be very useful for us, right?

1049
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:51,541
Wait and watch how
I put you to work now.

1050
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:16,791
It wouldn't have
been possible for me..

1051
00:55:16,833 --> 00:55:18,375
..if all of you wouldn't
have been there for me.

1052
00:55:18,458 --> 00:55:19,125
Thank you.

1053
00:55:19,208 --> 00:55:20,375
Thank you so much, friends.

1054
00:55:20,833 --> 00:55:22,041
Don't be formal, Abhi.
- Yes.

1055
00:55:22,041 --> 00:55:23,541
We are always there for you.

1056
00:55:23,625 --> 00:55:25,291
Abhi.
- Yes?

1057
00:55:25,416 --> 00:55:26,166
I am leaving.

1058
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:28,500
I have a shooting at night hour.
- Okay.

1059
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:29,583
Listen.

1060
00:55:30,083 --> 00:55:32,666
No one should know
that father is alive.

1061
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:33,875
Hey, no, no.

1062
00:55:33,958 --> 00:55:35,666
You didn't have to tell me about this.

1063
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:39,791
He made me my card. Today,
I am a junior artist supplier.

1064
00:55:40,125 --> 00:55:41,791
It is all because of his blessing.

1065
00:55:42,458 --> 00:55:44,166
I can do everything for him.

1066
00:55:44,666 --> 00:55:46,125
Tell me if need be.

1067
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:48,291
I am leaving, brother.
- Yes, yes, please leave.

1068
00:55:48,375 --> 00:55:49,333
I am leaving.

1069
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:52,833
"What is my name?"

1070
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:55,041
"My name is Sheila."

1071
00:55:55,083 --> 00:55:56,875
"Sheila's youth."

1072
00:55:56,916 --> 00:55:58,125
"Sheila.."

1073
00:55:58,208 --> 00:55:59,333
"I am too attractive for you."

1074
00:55:59,416 --> 00:56:00,208
"Sheila's youth."

1075
00:56:00,291 --> 00:56:02,000
"You wouldn't be
able to get hold of me."

1076
00:56:02,041 --> 00:56:03,291
"No, no, no, no, Sheila."

1077
00:56:03,375 --> 00:56:04,166
"I am too attractive for you."

1078
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:04,708
Oh no.

1079
00:56:04,791 --> 00:56:06,375
"Sheila's youth."

1080
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,125
"I am.."

1081
00:56:08,208 --> 00:56:10,000
Bunty used to listen to
this song all the time.

1082
00:56:10,541 --> 00:56:12,208
"My name is Sheila."

1083
00:56:12,333 --> 00:56:14,541
"Sheila's youth."

1084
00:56:14,625 --> 00:56:16,541
"I am too attractive for you."

1085
00:56:16,625 --> 00:56:18,541
"You wouldn't be.."

1086
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,291
He went out of my hands.

1087
00:56:21,916 --> 00:56:24,875
Brother, it wasn't right on your
part to come to Mumbai at this time.

1088
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:29,166
Brother..
- Hey! I don't need suggestions.

1089
00:56:29,291 --> 00:56:33,166
You were supposed to find out
the one who has killed my brother.

1090
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:34,583
The whole of police
department is very alert..

1091
00:56:34,666 --> 00:56:36,333
..after Guru Talwar
was killed, brother.

1092
00:56:36,375 --> 00:56:37,833
I cannot find out new information.

1093
00:56:37,916 --> 00:56:39,708
No, no, no, no.

1094
00:56:39,791 --> 00:56:42,250
I don't have a habit
of listening to a no.

1095
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:47,083
I want the name of the one
who has killed Bunty. His name!

1096
00:56:48,166 --> 00:56:51,208
Hail Lord.

1097
00:56:56,791 --> 00:56:59,375
Sunanda! Abhi!

1098
00:57:01,166 --> 00:57:02,375
Sunanda..
- Brother!

1099
00:57:02,458 --> 00:57:03,041
Brother..
- Look here.

1100
00:57:03,125 --> 00:57:04,750
What happened?
- Brother is conscious.

1101
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:07,000
Brother..
- He has regained consciousness.

1102
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:08,250
Brother! Brother, can you see me?

1103
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:10,750
Brother, it is me..
- Hey, has anyone informed Abhi?

1104
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:11,875
What?
- Yes, call him, call him.

1105
00:57:11,916 --> 00:57:13,666
Go, go, go..
- Yes, go fast. Make it fast.

1106
00:57:13,708 --> 00:57:16,000
Abhi. Abhi!
- Yes?

1107
00:57:16,583 --> 00:57:17,666
Come fast.

1108
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,125
Brother has opened his eyes.

1109
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:21,791
Father!

1110
00:57:30,833 --> 00:57:33,333
Debda. Look there.

1111
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:35,666
Your son. Abhi!

1112
00:58:04,041 --> 00:58:05,875
Father!

1113
00:58:19,833 --> 00:58:20,666
What is this?

1114
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:21,875
Indrani!

1115
00:58:21,958 --> 00:58:23,500
Sunanda.
- Yes.

1116
00:58:24,458 --> 00:58:25,708
Yes?

1117
00:58:27,958 --> 00:58:30,250
Come.
- This is..

1118
00:58:42,416 --> 00:58:44,000
I don't see Anshu anywhere.

1119
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:46,000
Anshu is..

1120
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:47,958
What is the matter?

1121
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:49,625
Why are you quiet?

1122
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:51,500
What happened to Anshu?

1123
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:52,583
Debda.

1124
00:58:52,625 --> 00:58:54,708
Actually Anshu is..
- Hey!

1125
00:58:55,458 --> 00:58:58,666
Tell him the truth.
Father wouldn't mind at all.

1126
00:58:59,708 --> 00:59:01,500
Uncle has gone to America, father.
- What?

1127
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:02,833
Yes.

1128
00:59:02,916 --> 00:59:05,958
America?
- Anshu has gone to America?

1129
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:09,166
Yes, father. Uncle has
got a good job in America.

1130
00:59:09,375 --> 00:59:12,000
He really wanted to come when he
heard that you have come back.

1131
00:59:12,041 --> 00:59:14,541
But he cannot come
because of a visa problem.

1132
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:16,416
No, no, there is no need to hurry.

1133
00:59:16,916 --> 00:59:18,208
Make a phone call to him.

1134
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:19,375
I want to talk to him.

1135
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,625
Debda. I wanted to say that..

1136
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:22,916
..it is midnight there at the moment.

1137
00:59:23,166 --> 00:59:24,416
Maybe he has gone off to sleep.

1138
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,458
Talk to him in the morning.

1139
00:59:25,708 --> 00:59:26,833
But it will be midnight here.

1140
00:59:26,916 --> 00:59:28,916
And Debda will be asleep
by then and then.. - Hey!

1141
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:29,750
What?

1142
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:30,458
Hey, uncle..

1143
00:59:30,541 --> 00:59:32,166
Uncle is right.

1144
00:59:32,208 --> 00:59:35,750
Call him right now.
I haven't spoken to him for so long.

1145
00:59:36,958 --> 00:59:38,416
Call him.

1146
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:42,916
Why do you speak
rubbish and create a mess?

1147
00:59:43,458 --> 00:59:45,125
Should I say something
else and try to cover this?

1148
00:59:45,208 --> 00:59:45,708
Let it be.

1149
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:46,583
What?

1150
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:48,458
Hello, uncle? This is..

1151
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,625
This is Abhi.

1152
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:51,750
One minute. Father
wants to talk to you.

1153
00:59:52,916 --> 00:59:54,875
What? Great.

1154
00:59:55,166 --> 00:59:56,833
I am doing great, dear.

1155
00:59:56,916 --> 00:59:59,833
Everyone is here.
Why wouldn't I be well?

1156
00:59:59,916 --> 01:00:01,125
Did he do planchet?

1157
01:00:01,166 --> 01:00:02,291
How are you?

1158
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:05,625
I am fine, brother. I will
come there as soon as possible.

1159
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:10,041
You take care of yourself.
Don't worry about me.

1160
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:13,958
Take care of your visa problem
and come here quickly, okay?

1161
01:00:14,041 --> 01:00:15,333
Okay, brother.
- I am hanging up.

1162
01:00:16,791 --> 01:00:18,000
Here you are.

1163
01:00:18,125 --> 01:00:19,333
Today..

1164
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:20,916
Today I am very happy.

1165
01:00:21,041 --> 01:00:23,875
Hey, everything seems
like a haze to me. - Oh no.

1166
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:24,708
Hey Akhilesh.
- Yes?

1167
01:00:24,791 --> 01:00:25,666
Anand.
- Yes?

1168
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:27,375
I want to meet my people once.

1169
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:29,750
Debraj Rai.
- Hail. Hail.

1170
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:32,166
Debraj Rai.
- Hail. Hail.

1171
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:33,416
Father.
- Yes?

1172
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,958
You wanted to meet all of them, right?

1173
01:00:35,041 --> 01:00:35,541
Yes.

1174
01:00:35,625 --> 01:00:37,375
They are here to meet you today.

1175
01:00:37,458 --> 01:00:40,000
Debraj Rai.
- Hail. Hail.

1176
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:42,541
Debraj Rai.
- Hail. Hail.

1177
01:00:42,625 --> 01:00:45,041
Debraj Rai.
- Hail. Hail.

1178
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:47,791
Debraj Rai.
- Hail. Hail.

1179
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:49,916
Debraj Rai.
- Hail. Hail.

1180
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,958
Hey! He looks like
the original Debraj Rai, Babla.

1181
01:00:54,041 --> 01:00:55,916
He is doing the
character of Debraj Rai.

1182
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,125
So do you think he will look
like you instead of Debraj Rai?

1183
01:00:58,166 --> 01:00:59,250
Yes.
- Give the slogan.

1184
01:00:59,333 --> 01:01:00,125
Hail.
- Hail, hail.

1185
01:01:00,125 --> 01:01:01,375
Are all of you doing well?

1186
01:01:01,583 --> 01:01:02,666
Yes.
- Yes.

1187
01:01:02,791 --> 01:01:06,166
Why should we worry if we
have an MLA like your son?

1188
01:01:06,416 --> 01:01:10,791
Does your MLA stand
by you all the time?

1189
01:01:10,916 --> 01:01:13,041
He is better than you too.
- Yes.

1190
01:01:13,125 --> 01:01:14,916
He comes whenever we need him.
- Yes.

1191
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,833
Get well soon, brother.

1192
01:01:16,916 --> 01:01:18,916
We will have this revolution with you.

1193
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,500
Debraj Rai.
- Hail. Hail.

1194
01:01:20,541 --> 01:01:23,333
Debraj Rai.
- Hail. Hail.

1195
01:01:23,416 --> 01:01:27,333
MLA Abhiraj Rai. Today,
I feel proud because of you, sir.

1196
01:01:32,166 --> 01:01:34,916
We haven't ever lied to brother, Abhi.

1197
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,791
We used to feel very sad when we
couldn't talk to brother for so long.

1198
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:41,541
But it hurts more to lie.

1199
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:44,166
While standing in
front of the mirror..

1200
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:45,750
..when I have to put the
vermilion on my forehead..

1201
01:01:45,791 --> 01:01:47,625
..although my husband is dead..

1202
01:01:49,416 --> 01:01:52,000
..I feel my chest will
burst any moment, Abhi.

1203
01:01:54,208 --> 01:01:55,791
Do you think it doesn't hurt me?

1204
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,083
The doctor has said that I need
to keep father happy all the time.

1205
01:02:04,083 --> 01:02:07,333
I don't have the capacity
to get the moon for father.

1206
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:10,125
Hence I have got the
reflection of the moon..

1207
01:02:10,208 --> 01:02:12,500
..on the mirror and
I am trying to keep father happy.

1208
01:02:14,958 --> 01:02:16,208
You..

1209
01:02:17,625 --> 01:02:19,750
Please support me a little.

1210
01:02:20,791 --> 01:02:22,041
Please.

1211
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,083
Reality show?

1212
01:02:29,166 --> 01:02:31,083
Have you seen Big Boss?
- Yes.

1213
01:02:31,166 --> 01:02:34,125
The same on in which Shilpa
Shetty won 3 crores, right?

1214
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:35,875
Oh God, it is a wonderful matter.

1215
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,333
Yes.
- You mean, in a house..

1216
01:02:37,583 --> 01:02:38,958
..everything has to
indulge in love and fights.

1217
01:02:39,041 --> 01:02:40,375
And someone makes
decisions from a hidden place.

1218
01:02:40,458 --> 01:02:42,208
Yes.
- Yes, you are absolutely right.

1219
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:45,750
I see. - And here, the
decision will be made..

1220
01:02:45,833 --> 01:02:47,083
..by the great teacher, Mithon
Chakraborty from a hidden place.

1221
01:02:47,166 --> 01:02:47,750
Really?
- Absolutely.

1222
01:02:47,833 --> 01:02:48,458
Wow, this is great.
- Yes.

1223
01:02:48,541 --> 01:02:50,166
So what is your concept?

1224
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:52,291
Debraj Rai is alive.
- What?

1225
01:02:52,375 --> 01:02:53,541
And now instead of him..

1226
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:56,541
..the MLA is his son. Abhiraj Rai.

1227
01:02:56,625 --> 01:02:58,625
How does he see this?

1228
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:00,333
How happy he is.

1229
01:03:00,416 --> 01:03:03,125
How does he handle
different kinds of problems?

1230
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:05,250
And all of these will be watched..

1231
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:08,625
..by our secret cameras.

1232
01:03:08,666 --> 01:03:10,958
Secret camera?
- Yes, camera.

1233
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:11,958
Where is it?

1234
01:03:12,125 --> 01:03:13,291
Look there.

1235
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:14,916
That side.

1236
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:15,750
What?

1237
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,125
There is one there as well.

1238
01:03:20,125 --> 01:03:22,333
What is it?
- Since the show is about Debraj Rai..

1239
01:03:22,375 --> 01:03:24,708
Yes? - The cameras will work
for as long as he is there.

1240
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:26,833
Yes. - All the characters
will have to keep on acting.

1241
01:03:26,875 --> 01:03:27,833
Okay.
- Yes.

1242
01:03:27,916 --> 01:03:29,625
They can relax for
the rest of the time.

1243
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:33,083
I see. So how are you using me here?

1244
01:03:33,166 --> 01:03:34,375
I mean, what is my character?

1245
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:36,708
What do you want to do?
Positive or negative?

1246
01:03:36,791 --> 01:03:38,291
Of course negative.

1247
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:40,041
Positive doesn't have anything.

1248
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:42,291
Yes.
- Your first shot. Sharp at eleven.

1249
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:44,666
Eleven.

1250
01:03:44,708 --> 01:03:45,875
Outside alert.

1251
01:03:45,958 --> 01:03:47,041
Outside alert.

1252
01:03:47,125 --> 01:03:48,583
Father is coming.

1253
01:03:48,666 --> 01:03:51,166
Sir, I had taken 25,000 as a loan..

1254
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:55,541
..from Swarna Kamal for
my daughter's wedding.

1255
01:03:55,625 --> 01:03:57,541
Today, he is asking me
to pay the whole amount..

1256
01:03:57,625 --> 01:04:01,166
..or write my land on his name.

1257
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:04,333
Okay. So where is that fool?

1258
01:04:04,416 --> 01:04:06,250
Here I am. I am here.

1259
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,416
Hey!

1260
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,583
What did you think?

1261
01:04:09,666 --> 01:04:11,708
You would get saved
if you complain to the MLA?

1262
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:12,583
Yes?

1263
01:04:12,666 --> 01:04:15,708
10 or 20 of such MLAs are
always in my pocket all the time.

1264
01:04:16,208 --> 01:04:17,541
You have come to a wrong place..

1265
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:19,333
..and showing your
power to a wrong person.

1266
01:04:19,791 --> 01:04:22,958
Will you pay his money or not?

1267
01:04:23,041 --> 01:04:25,708
Even you are speaking in front
of wrong people and audience..

1268
01:04:25,791 --> 01:04:27,375
..and speaking wrong dialogues.

1269
01:04:27,458 --> 01:04:28,958
This is my business.

1270
01:04:29,083 --> 01:04:30,375
Interest on interest.

1271
01:04:30,458 --> 01:04:31,666
And I will levy more
interest on interest.

1272
01:04:31,708 --> 01:04:33,125
Thrashing on top of thrashing.

1273
01:04:33,208 --> 01:04:34,833
And again thrashing
on top of thrashing..

1274
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:38,208
..will help you get
rid of your wishes.

1275
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:41,708
Hey, what will you do to me? Hit me?

1276
01:04:41,833 --> 01:04:43,083
Try to hit me if you can.

1277
01:04:43,166 --> 01:04:44,166
With around four henchmen..

1278
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:46,083
..you feel you have
become someone great?

1279
01:04:46,166 --> 01:04:47,791
All those days are gone.

1280
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:50,916
One is as powerful
as much money he has.

1281
01:04:51,041 --> 01:04:51,833
Hey!

1282
01:04:52,125 --> 01:04:53,625
Quiet! Hey, old man.

1283
01:04:53,666 --> 01:04:54,791
Why are you getting bothered?

1284
01:04:54,875 --> 01:04:55,833
Why are you staring at me?

1285
01:04:55,916 --> 01:04:57,125
I will pull your eyes out.

1286
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:58,291
Who is that man?

1287
01:04:58,416 --> 01:05:00,125
Hey! What is this..
- Careful.

1288
01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:02,458
What is this? I will
be thrashed as well?

1289
01:05:02,541 --> 01:05:04,125
Actually I wanted to
say that you are..

1290
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:05,375
..showing down the
hero by your acting.

1291
01:05:05,458 --> 01:05:06,000
Yes, I will do that.

1292
01:05:06,083 --> 01:05:06,583
Yes.

1293
01:05:06,625 --> 01:05:07,833
So the hero has to
slap you and crush you.

1294
01:05:07,916 --> 01:05:09,041
Or else, this is meaningless.

1295
01:05:09,166 --> 01:05:09,750
Oh yes, yes.

1296
01:05:09,833 --> 01:05:11,166
Listen, you have to go
close and say something.

1297
01:05:11,375 --> 01:05:12,291
Or else, it will be out.. -Yes, yes.

1298
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:14,083
You have to go.

1299
01:05:14,916 --> 01:05:16,791
I am very happy with your work.

1300
01:05:16,958 --> 01:05:19,000
Will you work for me as a hired goon?

1301
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:20,666
Yes?

1302
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,333
Hey, what is this? My head
is tossing and turning..

1303
01:05:22,416 --> 01:05:23,708
Did you see that..
- Oh no, what is this?

1304
01:05:23,791 --> 01:05:24,916
Yes, yes.
- He is right.

1305
01:05:24,958 --> 01:05:27,166
Hey, the father's son
is like soldier's horse.

1306
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:28,916
Oh no, no, no, no.

1307
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,458
Hey!

1308
01:05:30,541 --> 01:05:32,791
He must get the money by tomorrow.

1309
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:36,791
Or else, I will skin you
alive by thrashing you hard.

1310
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:39,041
'In order to become a
hero in front of Mithoon..'

1311
01:05:39,125 --> 01:05:41,375
'..he might kill me in reality.'

1312
01:05:41,708 --> 01:05:43,875
'But even I am a true player.'

1313
01:05:43,916 --> 01:05:45,083
What happened?

1314
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:47,500
Will you give it or..
- I will give it.

1315
01:05:48,333 --> 01:05:50,125
I will give it, I will.
Hey, I will give it, I will give it.

1316
01:05:50,208 --> 01:05:51,541
I will give it.
I will give all the money.

1317
01:05:51,625 --> 01:05:52,833
Spare me.

1318
01:05:52,916 --> 01:05:53,916
Yes.

1319
01:05:54,125 --> 01:05:55,291
Now you may leave.
- Yes.

1320
01:05:55,416 --> 01:05:56,625
Go and ask for forgiveness from him.

1321
01:05:56,708 --> 01:05:58,583
Yes, I am going. Where is the old man?

1322
01:05:58,666 --> 01:05:59,916
Oh yes, I forgot.

1323
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,500
Sir! Hey, sir. Listen.

1324
01:06:03,583 --> 01:06:06,208
The money made my whole body hot.

1325
01:06:06,416 --> 01:06:08,708
That is why I said rubbish to you.

1326
01:06:08,791 --> 01:06:10,875
Forgive me, sir.

1327
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:14,875
Okay, okay, try to serve
people better from now on.

1328
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,166
Go.
- Yes.

1329
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:17,666
One minute.

1330
01:06:18,083 --> 01:06:20,500
You put up a good act of
doing good for people.

1331
01:06:20,583 --> 01:06:21,458
What?

1332
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:25,583
But how much ever you want
to show off your expressions..

1333
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:27,583
..the great teacher
will give me the prize.

1334
01:06:27,708 --> 01:06:28,708
Oh no, what is this?
- Hey!

1335
01:06:28,791 --> 01:06:31,000
What is this?
- Hey Abhi.

1336
01:06:31,333 --> 01:06:33,416
This fool hasn't changed yet.

1337
01:06:33,541 --> 01:06:36,250
Thrash him more..
- Oh my God.

1338
01:06:36,333 --> 01:06:38,041
Outside relax.

1339
01:06:38,125 --> 01:06:38,958
Sit down.

1340
01:06:39,041 --> 01:06:40,041
Hey listen.
- Yes.

1341
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:42,583
Okay, what did you tell him
that he slapped you so hard?

1342
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:43,458
Hey, what would I tell him?

1343
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:45,625
I said that he is acting well.
- Oh God.

1344
01:06:45,708 --> 01:06:47,666
Oh no.. -Why? Shouldn't I say it?

1345
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:50,041
Hey, brother, this was your mistake.
- Why?

1346
01:06:50,166 --> 01:06:52,916
You shouldn't call any artist good
in front of the camera. - I see.

1347
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,166
Audience will decide who
is doing well or not. - Yes.

1348
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:57,708
And our great teacher.

1349
01:06:57,791 --> 01:06:58,375
I see.
- Yes.

1350
01:06:58,416 --> 01:06:59,291
Anyway, forget it.

1351
01:06:59,375 --> 01:07:00,708
Can you see that camera there?

1352
01:07:01,916 --> 01:07:03,458
Go and ask for votes there.

1353
01:07:03,541 --> 01:07:04,916
What?
- Or how would audience vote for you?

1354
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,333
Yes. - Go, go, go, ask
for votes. Ask for votes.

1355
01:07:06,458 --> 01:07:07,666
Yes..
- Go.

1356
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:09,833
Hi, I am Swarna Mahal.

1357
01:07:09,916 --> 01:07:13,458
Vote for me if you liked my acting.

1358
01:07:13,708 --> 01:07:15,416
Mahaguru. And then send
Mahaguru and put a space.

1359
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,541
Then write Swarna
Mahal and send it to 5535.

1360
01:07:17,625 --> 01:07:19,000
Greetings.

1361
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:27,875
Many members of the gang
members have been arrested.

1362
01:07:27,958 --> 01:07:30,666
There have been many
explosives and arms found from them.

1363
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:35,375
There has been a big
accident in Delhi too.

1364
01:07:37,416 --> 01:07:39,458
We will arrest this
criminal very soon.

1365
01:07:39,541 --> 01:07:40,750
And I will bring him to justice.

1366
01:07:40,791 --> 01:07:42,333
Hey!

1367
01:07:47,958 --> 01:07:49,083
What is it?

1368
01:07:49,125 --> 01:07:51,583
You said that you don't
have a network in Kolkata.

1369
01:07:51,666 --> 01:07:53,458
So what is this?

1370
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:57,541
There are some networks with
which brother deals directly.

1371
01:07:58,125 --> 01:07:59,708
I don't know about them.

1372
01:08:00,333 --> 01:08:03,375
If brother comes to
know that I am alive..

1373
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:07,041
..he will skin all of you.

1374
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:09,958
Even I want your brother to come here.

1375
01:08:10,625 --> 01:08:14,291
I am ready to welcome him.

1376
01:08:21,041 --> 01:08:23,291
He doesn't know anything
about the Kolkata network.

1377
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:26,083
This news has to be
given to the commissioner.

1378
01:08:28,166 --> 01:08:29,541
Don't break the protocol.

1379
01:08:29,833 --> 01:08:31,625
Have you ever seen Ajit jump over..

1380
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:33,875
..Byomkesh Bakshi and make
the communication with..

1381
01:08:33,958 --> 01:08:35,791
..the high levels on his own.

1382
01:08:36,291 --> 01:08:38,000
I will tell him
everything that has to be said.

1383
01:08:41,666 --> 01:08:42,958
Please go out.

1384
01:08:43,041 --> 01:08:44,458
Yes, sir.

1385
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:49,833
Yes, Mr. Bakshi, tell me.

1386
01:08:49,958 --> 01:08:50,791
Good morning, sir.

1387
01:08:50,916 --> 01:08:52,666
Yes, Bunty said there is
no network in Kolkata.

1388
01:08:52,708 --> 01:08:55,458
So I don't think there is a need
to send a team to Kolkata, sir.

1389
01:08:55,541 --> 01:09:00,125
Mr. Bakshi, give the phone to Abhi.

1390
01:09:02,708 --> 01:09:05,291
Okay, sir. One minute, sir.

1391
01:09:06,083 --> 01:09:07,041
Take it.

1392
01:09:07,166 --> 01:09:08,375
No, sir, it is fine, please talk.

1393
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,291
There is no problem.

1394
01:09:11,208 --> 01:09:13,041
No, no, sir, it is okay.

1395
01:09:13,541 --> 01:09:15,000
Sir respects the seniors.

1396
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:16,958
That is why he wants the
juniors to do all the work.

1397
01:09:17,041 --> 01:09:18,708
He gives the instructions to them.

1398
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,125
Take it.

1399
01:09:21,583 --> 01:09:22,333
Yes, sir.

1400
01:09:22,416 --> 01:09:23,750
Well done, Abhi.

1401
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:26,375
According to the
information found from Bunty..

1402
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:28,250
..we have raided the
place of Guru Nayak..

1403
01:09:28,333 --> 01:09:30,166
..and have been able to
uproot his network considerably.

1404
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:32,166
Have you decided what
you are going to do next?

1405
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:34,666
I need to look through a
few things in Kolkata.

1406
01:09:35,041 --> 01:09:37,583
And then I will understand
where the real problem lies.

1407
01:09:37,666 --> 01:09:39,750
Okay, okay, carry on.

1408
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:43,541
Hasn't it recovered yet?

1409
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:45,416
You feel this is funny, right?

1410
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,041
It is very funny!

1411
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:48,583
What are you saying, sir?

1412
01:09:48,666 --> 01:09:50,666
Now what..

1413
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:51,583
Yes, tell me, dear.

1414
01:09:51,666 --> 01:09:53,791
Hello, father. Where are you?

1415
01:09:53,875 --> 01:09:56,458
Will you please drop me
from home to the temple?

1416
01:09:56,541 --> 01:09:59,375
Okay, fine, stand there. I am coming.

1417
01:09:59,625 --> 01:10:02,666
By the way, what
does your daughter do?

1418
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:07,750
We are looking around. We have
got a lot of good alliances.

1419
01:10:09,791 --> 01:10:11,625
What about your girlfriend?

1420
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,791
How did you know about my girlfriend?

1421
01:10:13,833 --> 01:10:16,291
Wow. My name is Madhusudan Bakshi.

1422
01:10:16,375 --> 01:10:17,833
But I like the
detective Byonkesh Bakshi.

1423
01:10:17,958 --> 01:10:19,208
I know everything.

1424
01:10:19,416 --> 01:10:21,125
A beautiful girl from Malaysia.

1425
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:23,541
She has taken away everything.

1426
01:10:27,333 --> 01:10:29,458
Hey, are you angry?
- We are here.

1427
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:32,750
I see. There she is.

1428
01:10:39,166 --> 01:10:40,500
Father.
- Yes.

1429
01:10:40,583 --> 01:10:41,583
Offerings.

1430
01:10:41,666 --> 01:10:42,666
Give it.

1431
01:10:44,791 --> 01:10:46,000
Give some to him as well.

1432
01:10:46,083 --> 01:10:47,625
Abhi is my junior.

1433
01:10:48,375 --> 01:10:50,125
And she is Puja.

1434
01:10:50,458 --> 01:10:51,583
My elder daughter.

1435
01:10:51,666 --> 01:10:52,750
Hi.

1436
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:55,250
I had not expected this much too.

1437
01:10:55,666 --> 01:10:57,083
What didn't you expect?

1438
01:10:57,166 --> 01:11:01,000
This. Your daughter. Temple.

1439
01:11:01,083 --> 01:11:03,041
Veneration.
- I see.

1440
01:11:04,375 --> 01:11:07,083
Yes. I have brought them up well.

1441
01:11:08,166 --> 01:11:09,166
Now look here.

1442
01:11:09,208 --> 01:11:11,916
Some days back, she went to Delhi..

1443
01:11:12,041 --> 01:11:13,458
..and answered an IPS exam.

1444
01:11:14,041 --> 01:11:16,041
Like your cheating girlfriend..

1445
01:11:16,083 --> 01:11:17,416
..without telling me..

1446
01:11:17,541 --> 01:11:19,250
..she didn't go to
Malaysia for a fashion show.

1447
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:21,166
Do you know, dear?

1448
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:25,458
Sir went to Malaysia and fell
in love with a beautiful girl.

1449
01:11:25,791 --> 01:11:28,083
That is it. He was cheated.

1450
01:11:28,166 --> 01:11:30,375
Whom did you fall for, Abhi?

1451
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:32,125
Despite staying here,
I understood that..

1452
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:33,208
..the mother and
daughter were both cheats.

1453
01:11:33,291 --> 01:11:35,458
And you didn't
understand despite staying there?

1454
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,833
And the father is another fool!

1455
01:11:36,916 --> 01:11:38,000
He doesn't even know.

1456
01:11:38,125 --> 01:11:38,958
Where has his daughter gone?

1457
01:11:39,083 --> 01:11:39,625
What is she doing?

1458
01:11:39,708 --> 01:11:40,250
This is strange!

1459
01:11:40,333 --> 01:11:42,708
Father, please. Can we not have
this discussion at the moment?

1460
01:11:42,791 --> 01:11:44,291
And think about the girl.

1461
01:11:45,791 --> 01:11:47,875
She has cheated her
father and him as well.

1462
01:11:47,958 --> 01:11:49,833
And after this, when she has kids,
she will cheat them too.

1463
01:11:49,875 --> 01:11:51,500
Thank God I don't have a
cheating daughter like that.

1464
01:11:52,208 --> 01:11:53,250
What would you do if you did?

1465
01:11:53,333 --> 01:11:55,291
Now..
- Will you please keep quiet now?

1466
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,250
Why, dear? What happened?

1467
01:11:57,291 --> 01:11:58,208
We..

1468
01:11:58,250 --> 01:11:59,416
We are home, father.

1469
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:00,375
I see.

1470
01:12:01,208 --> 01:12:02,708
Come in, come in, come inside.

1471
01:12:03,541 --> 01:12:05,416
Dear, where are you going?

1472
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:06,958
Sit here.

1473
01:12:07,041 --> 01:12:08,083
Hey, you don't have to
feel shy in front of him.

1474
01:12:08,166 --> 01:12:09,208
He is my junior.

1475
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:12,208
Sit down.

1476
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:18,958
Listen. I had to go
to the supermarket.

1477
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:19,708
Should I go?

1478
01:12:19,791 --> 01:12:21,666
What is the need to ask? Go.

1479
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:25,000
I haven't stepped out of the
house without telling you.

1480
01:12:26,666 --> 01:12:27,625
Did you hear that?

1481
01:12:29,125 --> 01:12:30,375
Since the time we got married..

1482
01:12:30,458 --> 01:12:32,875
..she hasn't been able
to answer me back ever.

1483
01:12:34,375 --> 01:12:36,875
The same tradition has been
going on for the last 22 years.

1484
01:12:36,958 --> 01:12:40,166
Sir, ask madam to
raise her head a bit.

1485
01:12:44,166 --> 01:12:46,541
Have you modeled
madam the same way, sir?

1486
01:12:46,666 --> 01:12:48,416
Hey, forget it, not
everyone has to be modeled.

1487
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:50,708
Some people just get
molded because of the company.

1488
01:12:51,041 --> 01:12:53,791
Is everyone like the mother
of your cheating girlfriend?

1489
01:12:54,541 --> 01:12:57,250
She lied to her husband
and went to visit Malaysia?

1490
01:12:57,666 --> 01:12:59,500
She will say everything and do it.

1491
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,208
Father.
- Yes, come dear.

1492
01:13:02,791 --> 01:13:04,250
My younger daughter.

1493
01:13:04,333 --> 01:13:06,125
Sir, you spoke about my girlfriend.

1494
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:08,125
You spoke about
girlfriend's mother too.

1495
01:13:08,208 --> 01:13:10,000
Speak about her father once.

1496
01:13:11,333 --> 01:13:13,500
The lesser said about him, the better.

1497
01:13:13,791 --> 01:13:16,250
He is a fool. He is at fault.

1498
01:13:16,375 --> 01:13:17,583
Or else, does
someone's wife and daughter..

1499
01:13:17,666 --> 01:13:18,666
..lie and go out ever?

1500
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:20,166
There are. There are
many fools like this.

1501
01:13:20,208 --> 01:13:21,833
He thinks he is someone great.

1502
01:13:21,916 --> 01:13:23,416
Actually he is not someone great.

1503
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:24,833
He doesn't have his
feet on the ground ever.

1504
01:13:24,916 --> 01:13:25,833
He is always on the branches.

1505
01:13:25,916 --> 01:13:27,166
And..
- Stop it, father.

1506
01:13:27,208 --> 01:13:28,375
Abhi.
- Yes?

1507
01:13:28,458 --> 01:13:30,458
You are insulting my
father on purpose.

1508
01:13:30,541 --> 01:13:32,708
Hey, what happened? Tell me clearly.

1509
01:13:32,791 --> 01:13:34,041
I will tell you, sir.
- What?

1510
01:13:34,833 --> 01:13:36,875
The girl I fell in
love with in Malaysia..

1511
01:13:38,125 --> 01:13:42,041
..was none other
than your daughter Puja.

1512
01:13:44,375 --> 01:13:47,666
You are right, sir.
Her father is at fault.

1513
01:13:49,541 --> 01:13:52,500
Your daughter has won
out of 12 countries.

1514
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:56,000
You couldn't understand
your daughter's talent ever.

1515
01:13:56,416 --> 01:13:57,958
That is your fault.

1516
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:02,041
But madam didn't make that mistake.

1517
01:14:02,583 --> 01:14:05,208
Puja couldn't tell you
about her profession to..

1518
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:06,958
..you because of her fear
but today, she has spoken.

1519
01:14:07,833 --> 01:14:09,208
Do you know the reason, sir?

1520
01:14:09,291 --> 01:14:12,125
Because she wouldn't let her
father get insulted by anyone.

1521
01:14:13,125 --> 01:14:15,083
She loves her father as much.

1522
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:18,958
I know my limit, madam.

1523
01:14:20,041 --> 01:14:23,875
But sometimes, one has to
cross limits to do something good.

1524
01:14:25,083 --> 01:14:26,458
I am sorry.

1525
01:14:26,541 --> 01:14:28,666
I want to talk to my family.

1526
01:14:29,833 --> 01:14:33,500
Will you please excuse us
for a minute? - Yes, sir.

1527
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:41,083
Father, I thought..

1528
01:14:41,166 --> 01:14:42,416
I used to think..

1529
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
..it is a father's duty to
keep his children in discipline.

1530
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:49,083
But I didn't understand
that I had brought in..

1531
01:14:50,416 --> 01:14:52,083
..such a strict discipline that..

1532
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:55,625
..our daughter was scared of sharing
her moment of happiness with me.

1533
01:14:56,166 --> 01:14:59,416
Do as you feel.
But please let me know.

1534
01:15:00,375 --> 01:15:04,708
I mustn't come to
know from an outsider.

1535
01:15:04,916 --> 01:15:07,000
And there is something else.

1536
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:11,250
This boy is very dangerous.

1537
01:15:11,583 --> 01:15:14,458
His operation and love.
Both are dangerous.

1538
01:15:15,708 --> 01:15:18,083
Handle him carefully..
- Yes..

1539
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:19,458
All the best.

1540
01:15:26,125 --> 01:15:27,250
Come on.
- What?

1541
01:15:27,375 --> 01:15:28,416
Yes, sir.

1542
01:16:00,833 --> 01:16:02,458
"Hey heart, listen to me."

1543
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:04,000
'Let us go to the religious place."

1544
01:16:04,125 --> 01:16:07,625
"Will you swing on the lover?"

1545
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:09,375
"Hey heart, listen to me."

1546
01:16:09,458 --> 01:16:11,166
'Let us go to the religious place."

1547
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:14,125
"Will you swing on the lover?"

1548
01:16:14,208 --> 01:16:17,625
"Hey, save me."

1549
01:16:17,708 --> 01:16:18,833
"Hey, save me."

1550
01:16:18,916 --> 01:16:21,375
"Beautiful thief has
entered my heart."

1551
01:16:21,458 --> 01:16:23,750
"The cop has fallen in
love with the thief."

1552
01:16:23,833 --> 01:16:24,916
"Hey cop."

1553
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,791
"The cop has fallen in
love with the thief."

1554
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,000
"Hey heart, listen to me."

1555
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:38,791
'Let us go to the religious place."

1556
01:16:38,875 --> 01:16:42,125
"Will you swing on the lover?"

1557
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:44,083
"Hey heart, listen to me."

1558
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:45,833
'Let us go to the religious place."

1559
01:16:45,916 --> 01:16:48,833
"Will you swing on the lover?"

1560
01:16:48,875 --> 01:16:52,208
"Hey, listen, cop."

1561
01:16:52,291 --> 01:16:53,583
"Hey, listen, cop."

1562
01:16:53,625 --> 01:16:56,000
"I have got a fool. Your
police has been entrapped."

1563
01:16:56,041 --> 01:16:58,416
"My heart has loved him."

1564
01:16:58,458 --> 01:16:59,541
"Hey, cop."

1565
01:16:59,625 --> 01:17:03,250
"My heart has loved him."

1566
01:17:25,791 --> 01:17:28,541
"Fire. The fire of love."

1567
01:17:28,625 --> 01:17:32,416
"I have the spring of
love in my eyes all day."

1568
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:33,750
"In the breeze."

1569
01:17:33,833 --> 01:17:35,375
"I am floating in the breeze."

1570
01:17:35,458 --> 01:17:39,166
"In the maze of dreams with you."

1571
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:42,375
"Fire. The fire of love."

1572
01:17:42,458 --> 01:17:46,458
"I have the spring of
love in my eyes all day."

1573
01:17:46,541 --> 01:17:47,666
"In the breeze."

1574
01:17:47,791 --> 01:17:49,375
"I am floating in the breeze."

1575
01:17:49,458 --> 01:17:53,291
"In the maze of dreams with you."

1576
01:17:53,375 --> 01:17:56,666
"Listen, oh my God!'

1577
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:57,916
"Listen, oh my God!'

1578
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,458
"Please help in the love
affair of thief and police."

1579
01:18:00,541 --> 01:18:02,666
"Make us sit in the wedding altar."

1580
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:03,958
"Hey, teacher."

1581
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:07,333
"Make us sit in the wedding altar."

1582
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:36,833
"The kohl."

1583
01:18:36,916 --> 01:18:38,708
"The kohl of your eyes."

1584
01:18:38,791 --> 01:18:42,208
"It plays a drum in my heart."

1585
01:18:42,291 --> 01:18:45,541
"Mad. I have gone mad."

1586
01:18:45,583 --> 01:18:49,500
"And hence the showers make me wet."

1587
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:50,625
"The kohl."

1588
01:18:50,666 --> 01:18:52,583
"The kohl of your eyes."

1589
01:18:52,666 --> 01:18:56,500
"It plays a drum in my heart."

1590
01:18:56,583 --> 01:18:59,500
"Mad. I have gone mad."

1591
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:03,291
"And hence the showers make me wet."

1592
01:19:03,375 --> 01:19:06,791
"Hey, is everyone listening?"

1593
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:07,958
"Hey, is everyone listening?"

1594
01:19:08,041 --> 01:19:10,458
"Listen careful. The
colors of youth have come by."

1595
01:19:10,541 --> 01:19:12,791
"The affair of thief
and cop has started."

1596
01:19:12,875 --> 01:19:14,041
"Hey, cop."

1597
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:17,500
"The affair of thief
and cop has started."

1598
01:19:17,583 --> 01:19:20,958
"The wedding revelers are
dancing the Punjabi dance."

1599
01:19:21,041 --> 01:19:23,583
"The son-in-law has
come in the police van."

1600
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:27,125
"All the cops have
cast the evil eyes away."

1601
01:19:27,583 --> 01:19:32,083
"The affair of thief
and cop has started."

1602
01:19:34,625 --> 01:19:37,875
May Suraj live for ages!

1603
01:19:46,791 --> 01:19:48,666
What is it? Why do you look so tensed?

1604
01:19:48,875 --> 01:19:50,250
Interpol has informed me.

1605
01:19:50,333 --> 01:19:51,583
Guru Naik is in India.

1606
01:19:51,666 --> 01:19:54,333
And on the other side, I am getting
through the commissioner too.

1607
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:06,416
Hello.

1608
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:09,416
Interpol has given the
information that I am about to come.

1609
01:20:10,458 --> 01:20:12,458
And I have started my work.

1610
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:15,375
If you want to see the
commissioner alive..

1611
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:19,250
..get my brother alive to me
till time doesn't run out.

1612
01:20:20,166 --> 01:20:20,916
Alone.

1613
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,333
I will come alone.

1614
01:20:22,625 --> 01:20:25,041
But if something happens to the
commissioner in the meanwhile..

1615
01:20:25,875 --> 01:20:29,875
..I will kill each on his
respective position at the moment.

1616
01:20:44,166 --> 01:20:46,416
Go straight on the way to the factory.

1617
01:20:47,416 --> 01:20:51,250
Turn right. Turn left.

1618
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:21,833
I don't see anyone
before I kill anyone.

1619
01:21:21,875 --> 01:21:24,083
But I wanted to see
you before I kill you.

1620
01:21:24,166 --> 01:21:25,375
Do you know the reason?

1621
01:21:25,916 --> 01:21:28,125
When my henchman told me that
you look like a Hollywood hero..

1622
01:21:28,208 --> 01:21:31,625
..I had slashed him in a fit of anger.

1623
01:21:32,541 --> 01:21:35,083
Fool! He told me the
truth before he died.

1624
01:21:35,833 --> 01:21:37,708
You are just like that.

1625
01:21:37,791 --> 01:21:39,416
Hollywood hero.

1626
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:40,666
In the last twenty five years..

1627
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:42,291
..I have made bomb
blasts in twenty six places.

1628
01:21:42,333 --> 01:21:45,208
I have made 24 police
officers leave their posts.

1629
01:21:45,291 --> 01:21:50,250
There are 130 cases pending
against me in India and abroad.

1630
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:54,875
Interpol of 16 countries have
given our orders to arrest me.

1631
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:58,458
But none of them
could do anything to me.

1632
01:21:59,208 --> 01:22:01,250
Even you wouldn't be
able to do anything.

1633
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:03,083
This is my track record.

1634
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:04,583
Let Bunty go.

1635
01:22:04,666 --> 01:22:05,833
Hey fool!

1636
01:22:07,041 --> 01:22:09,625
I haven't come here to
give your brother back to you.

1637
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,083
I have come to take you
both tied to the same rope.

1638
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:17,458
I am a gold medalist in IPS.

1639
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:19,416
While I was anti-goon squad..

1640
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,958
..I have killed 46
people in encounter.

1641
01:22:22,416 --> 01:22:26,416
There is no account of people
I have killed in undercover operations.

1642
01:22:26,791 --> 01:22:31,416
They are killed and all the cases
have been covered under the carpet.

1643
01:22:31,833 --> 01:22:35,166
In India and abroad,
I have closed 226 cases.

1644
01:22:35,791 --> 01:22:38,083
I have done all this
in just five years.

1645
01:22:39,083 --> 01:22:41,208
And all of this is not
just my track record.

1646
01:22:41,916 --> 01:22:43,541
This is world time record.

1647
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:44,708
World time record.

1648
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:45,958
World time record.

1649
01:22:46,041 --> 01:22:46,625
World time record.

1650
01:22:46,708 --> 01:22:48,166
Okay, you have guts.

1651
01:22:48,208 --> 01:22:51,166
Your voice can be heard despite
standing in front of Guru Nayak.

1652
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:53,250
My blood group is a little different.

1653
01:22:53,625 --> 01:22:55,875
There are very few
people like me in Bengal.

1654
01:22:56,250 --> 01:23:00,125
They shake the very
base of the whole world.

1655
01:23:00,458 --> 01:23:02,541
Hey, Mumbai police will be shaken now.

1656
01:23:02,625 --> 01:23:04,500
Your commissioner is
with me at the moment.

1657
01:23:04,583 --> 01:23:06,541
I will kill him any time I want.

1658
01:23:06,625 --> 01:23:08,208
Hey, snacks vendor.

1659
01:23:08,666 --> 01:23:09,791
Look there.

1660
01:23:16,541 --> 01:23:17,833
Didn't I warn you?

1661
01:23:18,041 --> 01:23:20,750
Inviting me is like inviting trouble.

1662
01:23:22,208 --> 01:23:25,291
Are you wondering
how I played the game?

1663
01:23:25,916 --> 01:23:28,958
Come on, we will go
into flashback mode now.

1664
01:23:42,791 --> 01:23:44,166
Go that side.

1665
01:23:47,458 --> 01:23:48,500
Are you fine, sir?

1666
01:23:50,541 --> 01:23:53,125
Come. Let us go. Let us go. Come on.

1667
01:23:53,541 --> 01:23:56,583
When I have three
minutes with me, I think.

1668
01:23:57,083 --> 01:23:59,708
When I have two minutes, I thrash.

1669
01:24:00,125 --> 01:24:03,583
And if there is one minute, pack up!

1670
01:24:24,833 --> 01:24:26,083
Oh no.

1671
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:06,000
Hey!

1672
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,291
Throw the gun down.

1673
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:29,041
Throw the gun down or I will kill him.

1674
01:25:30,541 --> 01:25:32,500
Don't leave him because of me, Abhi.

1675
01:25:32,583 --> 01:25:34,333
Do your duty, Abhi.

1676
01:25:37,958 --> 01:25:39,416
No!

1677
01:25:39,541 --> 01:25:40,208
No, Abhi.

1678
01:25:40,291 --> 01:25:41,833
No, Abhi.

1679
01:25:43,166 --> 01:25:44,458
No!

1680
01:25:45,458 --> 01:25:46,791
Sir!

1681
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:50,083
Sir!

1682
01:25:55,208 --> 01:25:56,541
Sir!

1683
01:25:59,416 --> 01:26:01,083
Sir! Sir!

1684
01:26:02,708 --> 01:26:05,041
Abhi.
- Sir.

1685
01:26:05,625 --> 01:26:07,125
I had given word to my son..

1686
01:26:07,208 --> 01:26:07,958
Brother!

1687
01:26:08,041 --> 01:26:09,875
We will not spare the criminals.

1688
01:26:09,958 --> 01:26:10,958
Brother!

1689
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:12,750
I am leaving you.

1690
01:26:12,833 --> 01:26:13,833
Are you fine?

1691
01:26:13,916 --> 01:26:15,500
I have faith.

1692
01:26:16,666 --> 01:26:18,125
You wouldn't spare them.

1693
01:26:18,208 --> 01:26:19,166
Come on.

1694
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:22,250
Yes, sir.
- Don't spare them.

1695
01:26:22,333 --> 01:26:23,958
Yes, sir..
- Yes.

1696
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,583
Sir! Sir!

1697
01:26:35,333 --> 01:26:37,541
Hey, come fast. Come fast!

1698
01:27:50,291 --> 01:27:51,416
Hey!

1699
01:27:51,916 --> 01:27:52,708
Come on.

1700
01:28:00,833 --> 01:28:01,791
Come on.

1701
01:28:06,875 --> 01:28:08,208
Hey!

1702
01:28:10,291 --> 01:28:11,583
Hey!

1703
01:28:20,708 --> 01:28:22,916
Brother, stop. Brother, stop! Please.

1704
01:28:23,125 --> 01:28:24,041
Come on.

1705
01:28:24,208 --> 01:28:25,375
Come on.

1706
01:28:25,916 --> 01:28:28,083
Brother, stop. Brother, stop!

1707
01:28:31,583 --> 01:28:34,125
Hey brother..
- Run! Come on.

1708
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:35,916
Oh brother..
- Run faster.

1709
01:28:47,583 --> 01:28:48,708
Brother.

1710
01:28:48,791 --> 01:28:50,416
Bunty!

1711
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:58,916
Akhil.
- Shibu.

1712
01:29:59,083 --> 01:30:00,958
You are working for Guru Nayak?

1713
01:30:01,041 --> 01:30:03,208
Do you know whom you wanted to kill?

1714
01:30:03,291 --> 01:30:07,541
He is Debda's son.
- Abhi?

1715
01:30:07,625 --> 01:30:10,916
Kill me. Kill me, Akhil.

1716
01:30:11,333 --> 01:30:12,375
Get up.

1717
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:17,416
Uncle Shibu. You were
the closest aide of father.

1718
01:30:18,458 --> 01:30:20,250
You considered father as God.

1719
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:23,666
And you started
working for Guru Nayak?

1720
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:26,125
I am not a part of
the gang of Guru Nayak.

1721
01:30:26,208 --> 01:30:28,291
Debraj sir.

1722
01:30:28,666 --> 01:30:33,208
I had sent for the medicines
going by the doctor's prescriptions.

1723
01:30:33,291 --> 01:30:37,458
The boy's body went cold on
having the medicines once.

1724
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:41,958
Brother. The doctor
said that this boy died..

1725
01:30:42,041 --> 01:30:43,833
..because of having fake medicines.

1726
01:30:43,875 --> 01:30:47,583
And we have
information that Apurbo Ghosh..

1727
01:30:47,666 --> 01:30:49,458
..has set up the factory
of those medicines here..

1728
01:30:49,583 --> 01:30:51,250
..in association with
a mafia gang of Mumbai.

1729
01:30:53,458 --> 01:30:55,000
Burn it..
- Come on, burn it down.

1730
01:30:55,041 --> 01:30:56,750
Burn it..
- Come on, burn it down.

1731
01:30:56,791 --> 01:30:58,875
Because of your
factory of fake medicines..

1732
01:30:59,416 --> 01:31:02,333
Even if you would have spent
your entire wealth for this kid..

1733
01:31:02,416 --> 01:31:08,375
..you would not be able to
return the kid back to his parents.

1734
01:31:09,833 --> 01:31:11,958
Stop your business of fake medicines.

1735
01:31:12,541 --> 01:31:16,000
Or you and your brother Madam..

1736
01:31:16,625 --> 01:31:18,333
..will be sent to jail by me.

1737
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:25,416
The branches of my business
are spread over a lot of cities.

1738
01:31:25,791 --> 01:31:27,916
If any politician tries to do
away with those branches of mine..

1739
01:31:28,041 --> 01:31:30,000
..the matter is very clear.

1740
01:31:30,083 --> 01:31:33,500
He needs a share of
the profit. How much?

1741
01:31:34,125 --> 01:31:35,125
Hey, listen.

1742
01:31:35,208 --> 01:31:38,666
Debraj Rai is not a mean politician.

1743
01:31:38,791 --> 01:31:40,875
He is a mass leader.
He is the leader for people.

1744
01:31:40,916 --> 01:31:43,083
I had thought that the matter will
be solved with a glass of water..

1745
01:31:43,166 --> 01:31:44,833
..and a cup of tea.

1746
01:31:45,666 --> 01:31:47,833
If someone tries to
create problems for our work..

1747
01:31:48,583 --> 01:31:51,458
..we reach a compromise with them.

1748
01:31:51,541 --> 01:31:53,166
And if that fails too..

1749
01:31:54,083 --> 01:31:55,416
Hey..
- Hey, you!

1750
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:56,541
Anshu.

1751
01:31:57,250 --> 01:31:59,125
I think he hasn't found
out the information on me..

1752
01:31:59,208 --> 01:32:04,916
..and got down on the Netaji
Subhash Chandra Bose airport.

1753
01:32:05,291 --> 01:32:08,833
I give one chance to
everyone to change their behavior.

1754
01:32:08,916 --> 01:32:14,041
Cut off the roots of all the branches
that you have in West Bengal.

1755
01:32:14,458 --> 01:32:16,583
Or you wouldn't get a second chance.

1756
01:32:16,958 --> 01:32:19,208
Your fake business and you..

1757
01:32:19,291 --> 01:32:21,291
..will be done away with together.

1758
01:32:21,791 --> 01:32:23,041
Go away.

1759
01:32:23,125 --> 01:32:24,541
Get out, I say.

1760
01:32:25,291 --> 01:32:26,791
'After that meeting with him..'

1761
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:29,375
'..we left for Kolkata with Debda.'

1762
01:32:31,541 --> 01:32:32,750
What is happening?
- Actually..

1763
01:32:32,833 --> 01:32:33,916
What has happened to you?

1764
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,500
Brother, I was
feeling a little sleepy.

1765
01:32:36,958 --> 01:32:38,041
Splash some water on your eyes.

1766
01:32:38,125 --> 01:32:38,875
Park the car on the side.

1767
01:32:38,958 --> 01:32:40,791
What?
- Park it aside.

1768
01:32:55,208 --> 01:32:56,416
Brother!

1769
01:32:58,541 --> 01:33:00,166
Hey!

1770
01:33:00,958 --> 01:33:04,000
Hey!

1771
01:33:07,333 --> 01:33:08,708
Hey!

1772
01:33:09,166 --> 01:33:10,375
Hey!

1773
01:33:13,708 --> 01:33:15,000
Brother.
- Anshu!

1774
01:33:15,083 --> 01:33:17,125
Run away with brother.
I will take care of them.

1775
01:33:17,208 --> 01:33:18,541
Run away.
- Yes.

1776
01:33:18,583 --> 01:33:19,625
Brother!

1777
01:33:22,625 --> 01:33:24,000
Hey! Hey!

1778
01:33:25,708 --> 01:33:27,541
Hey, stop. Hey, stop.

1779
01:33:44,583 --> 01:33:46,833
As soon as I got the news,
I went running to your house.

1780
01:33:46,916 --> 01:33:49,875
But when I got there, I found out..

1781
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:51,166
..that you have sold off your house..

1782
01:33:51,208 --> 01:33:52,583
..and have left Debnagar.

1783
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:57,625
That was the time I decided
that I wouldn't spare any of them.

1784
01:33:58,166 --> 01:33:59,750
I will kill each one of them.

1785
01:34:00,416 --> 01:34:04,958
Till date, Debraj Rai was stuck
in my throat like a fish bone.

1786
01:34:05,041 --> 01:34:06,791
Now that the bone is gone..

1787
01:34:06,875 --> 01:34:10,541
..the food has gone in smoothly.
- Yes.

1788
01:34:10,625 --> 01:34:12,041
Hey!

1789
01:34:12,583 --> 01:34:15,625
I will bury you all
alive here, you fools!

1790
01:34:15,916 --> 01:34:16,916
By joining forces with them..

1791
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,541
..you have killed Debda!

1792
01:34:19,083 --> 01:34:20,708
Hey!

1793
01:34:20,791 --> 01:34:22,750
In the jail, I found
out from an inmate.

1794
01:34:23,333 --> 01:34:25,083
Guru Nayak has come to Mumbai.

1795
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,458
I went to Mumbai to kill him and
I got hold of his brother Bunty.

1796
01:34:32,541 --> 01:34:35,791
I had thought that I will get Guru
Nayak if I keep Bunty entrapped.

1797
01:34:36,166 --> 01:34:37,750
And I will kill him.

1798
01:34:39,041 --> 01:34:41,666
Maybe Debda's spirit
would be pacified with that.

1799
01:34:42,916 --> 01:34:43,875
Shibu.

1800
01:34:43,958 --> 01:34:45,333
Debda hasn't been killed.

1801
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,458
Debda is alive.

1802
01:34:54,041 --> 01:34:56,375
Why didn't you tell me
all this for so long?

1803
01:34:56,458 --> 01:34:57,541
Because of fear.

1804
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:01,708
Anshu was no more
and Debda was in coma.

1805
01:35:01,791 --> 01:35:04,000
And what if they had
done something to you?

1806
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:06,041
And that is why, because of fear..

1807
01:35:06,125 --> 01:35:08,500
..we took you and Debda to Mumbai.

1808
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,541
So that you are not harmed in any way.

1809
01:35:26,291 --> 01:35:28,791
Shibu.
- Debda.

1810
01:35:33,208 --> 01:35:34,166
Son.

1811
01:35:34,916 --> 01:35:36,583
Son. You are old.

1812
01:35:36,916 --> 01:35:39,708
But you are the same, Debda.

1813
01:35:40,291 --> 01:35:43,375
Krishna. Jaga.

1814
01:35:43,458 --> 01:35:44,541
Where are all of them?

1815
01:35:44,583 --> 01:35:47,583
They have gone to Varanasi to
offer veneration on your name.

1816
01:35:47,666 --> 01:35:49,750
Are they doing well?

1817
01:35:49,833 --> 01:35:51,125
Yes, yes, brother.

1818
01:35:51,208 --> 01:35:53,166
Anshu will come back from America.

1819
01:35:53,208 --> 01:35:55,416
All of us will have
fun together again.

1820
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,416
Come. Come inside.

1821
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:58,333
Come.

1822
01:35:58,416 --> 01:36:00,791
Abhi, don't spare the ones..

1823
01:36:01,125 --> 01:36:02,541
..who have killed
Anshu so heartlessly..

1824
01:36:02,666 --> 01:36:04,750
..and rendered your
father in this condition.

1825
01:36:04,791 --> 01:36:06,208
I will not spare anyone, uncle.

1826
01:36:06,916 --> 01:36:10,708
I will cheat them the way
they backstabbed father.

1827
01:36:12,125 --> 01:36:13,916
I will earn their trust first.

1828
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:16,333
And then I will play with that.

1829
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:19,041
I will kill them in a way..

1830
01:36:19,458 --> 01:36:21,458
..that will make them
repent before dying..

1831
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:25,541
..that why were they born in my area.

1832
01:36:25,625 --> 01:36:27,375
After the murder of the
scoundrel commissioner..

1833
01:36:27,458 --> 01:36:29,416
..the whole of Mumbai is on red alert.

1834
01:36:30,458 --> 01:36:32,375
Situation is very critical.

1835
01:36:33,250 --> 01:36:36,458
Brother, it would be correct to take..

1836
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:38,958
..shelter at Cool's house.

1837
01:36:39,333 --> 01:36:44,291
All my life I have stayed in
five star hotels like a king.

1838
01:36:44,375 --> 01:36:46,416
He has brought me down to the streets.

1839
01:36:46,458 --> 01:36:49,000
I will throw the fool into the
gutter and kill him like a rat!

1840
01:36:49,083 --> 01:36:51,708
Cool. Sir, cool down.

1841
01:36:51,791 --> 01:36:55,750
You are lucky that he didn't kill you.

1842
01:36:56,458 --> 01:36:59,875
I have to agree. He has guts.

1843
01:36:59,958 --> 01:37:03,416
He played a nice game with
all the boys of your gang.

1844
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:08,250
After seeing all this, you are
still contemplating killing him?

1845
01:37:08,333 --> 01:37:10,833
You should run away..
- You are praising him in front of me?

1846
01:37:10,916 --> 01:37:12,166
Now..
- You have got a lot of guts now?

1847
01:37:12,250 --> 01:37:13,958
Stop..
- Brother! Brother!

1848
01:37:14,041 --> 01:37:15,125
Brother..
- Now, look..

1849
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:16,250
Brother, only Cool can
take us out of here.

1850
01:37:16,333 --> 01:37:18,250
But I wouldn't spare him.
- Brother..

1851
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:19,583
Hey!
- What is..

1852
01:37:19,666 --> 01:37:22,375
If you kill him, we will
have to rot and die here.

1853
01:37:22,458 --> 01:37:25,208
Why?
- Cool, sir. Cool.

1854
01:37:25,291 --> 01:37:27,291
Yes.
- I gave you shelter.

1855
01:37:27,375 --> 01:37:29,666
And you put me at gun point?

1856
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,958
I am not hot with anger. I am cool.

1857
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:33,833
Yes.

1858
01:37:33,916 --> 01:37:35,625
Tea wouldn't be enough for you.

1859
01:37:35,666 --> 01:37:37,000
You need cold drink.

1860
01:37:37,083 --> 01:37:37,958
Yes.

1861
01:37:38,041 --> 01:37:39,333
Krishna Kant Mitra.

1862
01:37:39,416 --> 01:37:40,750
Alias Keshto Mitter.

1863
01:37:40,833 --> 01:37:42,375
The minister of the state.

1864
01:37:42,750 --> 01:37:43,791
Although people know he is a cheat..

1865
01:37:43,833 --> 01:37:45,083
..people vote for him.

1866
01:37:45,416 --> 01:37:48,208
Because he keeps on
taking your father's name.

1867
01:37:49,208 --> 01:37:52,291
Jagannath. Alias green eyed Jaga.

1868
01:37:52,416 --> 01:37:54,375
He was a dear
associate of your father.

1869
01:37:54,458 --> 01:37:56,916
Crime. Taking control of land.
Running a syndicate.

1870
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,375
The head of all the
misdeeds is this Jagganath.

1871
01:37:59,458 --> 01:38:01,333
He has 13 murder
charges to his credit.

1872
01:38:01,416 --> 01:38:03,250
Apurbo Ghosh. Family of demons.

1873
01:38:03,333 --> 01:38:04,333
Birth time is in the zone of cancer.

1874
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:05,500
Sun sign is Scorpio.

1875
01:38:05,583 --> 01:38:08,291
All three are partner is
any criminal activity.

1876
01:38:09,083 --> 01:38:10,500
According to sources..

1877
01:38:10,583 --> 01:38:13,166
..they have connections
with the gang of Guru Nayak.

1878
01:38:13,250 --> 01:38:14,666
Apurbo Ghosh's two sons.

1879
01:38:14,750 --> 01:38:15,791
Although they are fools..

1880
01:38:15,916 --> 01:38:17,541
..their Jupiter is very strong.

1881
01:38:17,708 --> 01:38:19,625
As soon as they girls..

1882
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:20,625
Who is this man?

1883
01:38:20,666 --> 01:38:23,458
Prem Jeet. A distant
relative of Keshto Mitter.

1884
01:38:23,541 --> 01:38:24,666
In order to make it in films..

1885
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:25,916
..he changed his name..

1886
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,166
..and sold off his entire
property to make a film.

1887
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:30,416
Because of bad planetary movements..

1888
01:38:30,541 --> 01:38:32,125
..the film doesn't
run longer than a day.

1889
01:38:32,208 --> 01:38:33,875
Premjeet learns his lesson.

1890
01:38:33,958 --> 01:38:36,541
Premjeet! He is our first target.

1891
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:40,875
Seventeen by five take.

1892
01:38:40,916 --> 01:38:41,833
31.
- Cut sound.

1893
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:43,875
It is rolling.
- Action.

1894
01:38:43,958 --> 01:38:46,166
When I decide to kill someone..

1895
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:48,625
..I ask him to get
insurance a month in advance.

1896
01:38:48,708 --> 01:38:50,291
Or else, he will have to
incur the whole expenditure.

1897
01:38:50,333 --> 01:38:51,666
Cut.
- Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.

1898
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:54,291
Hey idiot! Hey, what is this?

1899
01:38:54,375 --> 01:38:55,541
Are you having here?

1900
01:38:55,583 --> 01:38:56,833
By the time you finish the dialogue..

1901
01:38:56,958 --> 01:38:58,250
..the entire hall will be empty.

1902
01:38:58,333 --> 01:39:00,166
Energy. Energy. Hey, how
many takes it has been till now?

1903
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:01,125
Sir, 31.

1904
01:39:01,208 --> 01:39:03,791
Brother. We have had 31 takes,
brother. Act now at least.

1905
01:39:03,833 --> 01:39:05,000
Anyone here can act better than you.

1906
01:39:05,083 --> 01:39:05,916
And you..
- Hey!

1907
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,416
Hey..
- There are many people here.

1908
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:08,500
Ask them to do it.

1909
01:39:08,583 --> 01:39:09,416
Correct.

1910
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:12,916
If someone can act better than me,
I will quit the industry.

1911
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,250
Hey..
- Sir.

1912
01:39:14,875 --> 01:39:16,750
Can you try me once?

1913
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,083
Premjeet.

1914
01:39:19,333 --> 01:39:20,375
Can you do it?

1915
01:39:20,458 --> 01:39:22,791
I was born to act.

1916
01:39:22,875 --> 01:39:24,166
Yes.

1917
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:26,000
Okay. Act and show me.

1918
01:39:26,791 --> 01:39:28,000
Say action.

1919
01:39:28,416 --> 01:39:29,166
Action.

1920
01:39:29,958 --> 01:39:31,625
When I decide to kill someone..

1921
01:39:31,708 --> 01:39:37,208
..I ask him to get
insurance once month in advance.

1922
01:39:37,541 --> 01:39:38,666
Or the whole..

1923
01:39:41,083 --> 01:39:42,500
..expenditure will
have to be incurred.

1924
01:39:42,541 --> 01:39:43,375
Hey..
- Wow.

1925
01:39:43,458 --> 01:39:44,250
Hey..
- Very good. Very good.

1926
01:39:44,333 --> 01:39:45,250
Yes.
- That is great. Great!

1927
01:39:45,333 --> 01:39:46,000
I have got him.
- Yes.

1928
01:39:46,083 --> 01:39:47,541
I have got him. I have got my hero.

1929
01:39:47,583 --> 01:39:48,333
Wow..
- Yes, boss.

1930
01:39:48,416 --> 01:39:48,916
Excellent.
- Yes.

1931
01:39:48,958 --> 01:39:52,250
Super. Where were you
all this while, uncle?

1932
01:39:52,333 --> 01:39:53,875
I said without thinking much, sir.

1933
01:39:53,875 --> 01:39:56,583
By the way, I hope you are
interested in working in movies.

1934
01:39:56,666 --> 01:39:58,583
I have interest. That is
why I have been paying..

1935
01:39:58,666 --> 01:40:01,083
..interest to money lender, sir.

1936
01:40:01,125 --> 01:40:03,416
Anyway, sir. You saved me.

1937
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:05,708
Yes.
- Not saved. He killed you.

1938
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:07,958
The hero has brainwashed the producer.

1939
01:40:08,041 --> 01:40:10,291
The producer wouldn't give
even one more rupee for the movie.

1940
01:40:10,375 --> 01:40:11,541
Oh God.

1941
01:40:12,125 --> 01:40:13,208
What will happen now?

1942
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
You become the producer now.

1943
01:40:15,125 --> 01:40:15,916
Meaning?

1944
01:40:16,166 --> 01:40:18,958
Hey, you have your uncle in Singapore.

1945
01:40:19,083 --> 01:40:20,458
Haridas Pal.

1946
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:22,500
The one who has 100
acres of land in Bonga.

1947
01:40:22,583 --> 01:40:24,500
Sell it off and make the movie
with the money you earn as an agent.

1948
01:40:24,583 --> 01:40:27,208
Hey! I am the director. Not an agent.

1949
01:40:27,291 --> 01:40:27,958
Yes.

1950
01:40:28,041 --> 01:40:29,166
Hey, pack up. Pack up.

1951
01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:29,833
But listen..
- Pack up.

1952
01:40:29,916 --> 01:40:31,208
Hey, hey.
- Sir!

1953
01:40:32,125 --> 01:40:35,791
One minute.
Let me tell you something, sir.

1954
01:40:35,875 --> 01:40:37,666
For the sake of your movie.

1955
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:42,166
For the sake of this hero,
please agree, sir.

1956
01:40:42,791 --> 01:40:43,875
Really?
- Yes.

1957
01:40:43,958 --> 01:40:45,000
But..

1958
01:40:45,083 --> 01:40:46,333
Who will buy so much of land?

1959
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:49,458
There is someone.
Minister Keshto Mitra.

1960
01:40:49,875 --> 01:40:51,000
He is my brother.

1961
01:40:51,083 --> 01:40:52,166
He is such a fool.

1962
01:40:52,666 --> 01:40:55,041
He has cheated the
public of so much of money.

1963
01:40:55,125 --> 01:40:56,958
He invests in everything
that he lays his hands on.

1964
01:40:57,041 --> 01:40:57,833
I see.

1965
01:40:57,916 --> 01:41:00,666
He goes from one land
to another like a fly.

1966
01:41:00,750 --> 01:41:02,375
Think about it, sir.

1967
01:41:04,291 --> 01:41:05,666
Your money is ready.

1968
01:41:06,416 --> 01:41:08,083
Even your movie is ready.

1969
01:41:08,875 --> 01:41:10,708
Because of the money of the land..

1970
01:41:10,833 --> 01:41:12,958
..you can make the movie nicely.

1971
01:41:13,833 --> 01:41:17,166
Think about it. Tell me.

1972
01:41:17,416 --> 01:41:18,750
Action.
- Hey!

1973
01:41:18,833 --> 01:41:22,000
"Life is a beautiful journey."

1974
01:41:22,083 --> 01:41:25,750
"Who knows what would
happen here tomorrow?"

1975
01:41:26,833 --> 01:41:27,708
Hello.

1976
01:41:27,791 --> 01:41:28,958
Mithoon here.

1977
01:41:29,041 --> 01:41:30,500
Who? Mithoon from the corporation?

1978
01:41:31,125 --> 01:41:33,083
Hey, great teacher
Mithoon Chakraborty.

1979
01:41:34,458 --> 01:41:36,791
Great teacher? Mithoon Chakraborty?

1980
01:41:36,875 --> 01:41:38,250
You have called me?

1981
01:41:38,333 --> 01:41:40,291
I cannot even imagine about it, sir.

1982
01:41:40,375 --> 01:41:43,291
Listen. Today is the last
day to give the electric bill.

1983
01:41:43,375 --> 01:41:44,791
Hey, electric bill can go to hell.

1984
01:41:44,875 --> 01:41:47,250
Can't you see I am talking
to Mithoon Chakraborty here?

1985
01:41:47,333 --> 01:41:47,708
What?

1986
01:41:47,791 --> 01:41:48,375
What did you say?

1987
01:41:48,833 --> 01:41:50,708
Not to you, sir. Not to you.

1988
01:41:50,791 --> 01:41:52,375
Now I was talking to
your daughter-in-law.

1989
01:41:52,416 --> 01:41:53,333
Tell me, sir.

1990
01:41:53,416 --> 01:41:54,958
Listen, I have seen your clippings.

1991
01:41:55,458 --> 01:41:57,166
Even my children have seen them.

1992
01:41:57,666 --> 01:42:00,250
Excellent performance. Excellent.

1993
01:42:00,791 --> 01:42:03,083
Mimo said that Uttam
Kumar has come back.

1994
01:42:03,083 --> 01:42:04,291
Yes.
- Yes.

1995
01:42:04,375 --> 01:42:07,250
But your role is very small
in Debraj Rai's reality show.

1996
01:42:07,291 --> 01:42:10,291
They haven't used you properly.

1997
01:42:10,375 --> 01:42:12,041
What should I say, sir? Tell me.

1998
01:42:12,125 --> 01:42:15,083
All the small artists
are getting big roles.

1999
01:42:15,125 --> 01:42:16,333
And no one is even looking at us.

2000
01:42:16,416 --> 01:42:19,458
Hey, I have decided that I
will do a reality show on my own.

2001
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:22,916
And you will do the main
character in that. - I see.

2002
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:26,166
And my show will be
telecast before that show.

2003
01:42:26,208 --> 01:42:28,708
Even the prize money
is double. 4 crores.

2004
01:42:28,791 --> 01:42:30,083
What?
- Okay.

2005
01:42:30,166 --> 01:42:33,416
And remember one thing.
Don't tell anyone.

2006
01:42:33,416 --> 01:42:34,500
No!

2007
01:42:35,375 --> 01:42:38,250
I have decided that you
will be assured winner.

2008
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:40,750
My assistant will reach you
in some time with the concept.

2009
01:42:40,833 --> 01:42:42,958
Okay, sir. Okay, okay, okay.
- Yes.

2010
01:42:44,166 --> 01:42:44,708
Come.

2011
01:42:45,833 --> 01:42:50,291
When God gives something, he
gives everything in excess, darling.

2012
01:42:50,583 --> 01:42:52,125
Open it.
- No.

2013
01:42:54,083 --> 01:42:55,333
Hey, no, no.

2014
01:42:55,416 --> 01:42:57,791
Not my buttons. Open the door.

2015
01:42:57,875 --> 01:42:59,541
I see. Why are you
scolding me? I am opening it.

2016
01:42:59,625 --> 01:43:01,166
Oh no, she is a fool.

2017
01:43:03,125 --> 01:43:04,125
Greetings.
- Greetings. Is Kamal here?

2018
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:05,458
Yes, there he is.

2019
01:43:05,541 --> 01:43:06,375
Greetings. Greetings.
- Greetings.

2020
01:43:06,416 --> 01:43:07,250
Yes, greetings. Greetings.
- Greetings.

2021
01:43:07,333 --> 01:43:09,000
Sit, sit down.
- Greetings.

2022
01:43:09,125 --> 01:43:09,958
Tell me.

2023
01:43:10,041 --> 01:43:11,916
What is the concept of
your new reality show?

2024
01:43:12,041 --> 01:43:13,875
What? How did you know, sir?

2025
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,375
That we are here to talk
about the new reality show?

2026
01:43:16,625 --> 01:43:18,041
In fact, it was only last night that..

2027
01:43:18,125 --> 01:43:19,416
..Mithoon thought of this whole thing.

2028
01:43:19,458 --> 01:43:21,333
And just a while back,
the great teacher..

2029
01:43:21,375 --> 01:43:22,958
..informed me about me on the phone.

2030
01:43:23,041 --> 01:43:24,458
What are you saying, sir?

2031
01:43:25,875 --> 01:43:27,416
Mithoon called you?

2032
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:28,708
So there is no need to be surprised.

2033
01:43:28,791 --> 01:43:29,791
Only gems know gems.

2034
01:43:29,875 --> 01:43:31,458
Yes. What is the concept?

2035
01:43:31,541 --> 01:43:34,291
Actually the concept is
about buying and selling a land.

2036
01:43:34,666 --> 01:43:36,000
Mafia versus Land.

2037
01:43:36,083 --> 01:43:38,750
Title is great. It has the
essence of a twenty-twenty match.

2038
01:43:38,833 --> 01:43:40,791
Yes. What is my character?

2039
01:43:40,875 --> 01:43:42,541
Singapore's Haridas Pal.

2040
01:43:42,833 --> 01:43:43,833
Who is that?

2041
01:43:43,916 --> 01:43:44,666
He is a millionaire.

2042
01:43:44,750 --> 01:43:45,708
Millionaire.

2043
01:43:45,875 --> 01:43:48,833
The man has a lot of
money but he is very simple.

2044
01:43:49,666 --> 01:43:52,958
But he is very
dangerous if he is angry once.

2045
01:43:53,875 --> 01:43:55,625
Exactly. Same. Same. Same.

2046
01:43:55,666 --> 01:43:59,333
And at times, he feels very
proud because of his money.

2047
01:44:00,583 --> 01:44:01,833
No, sir. It has a lot of shades.

2048
01:44:01,916 --> 01:44:04,583
You will see. I will
just rock the character.

2049
01:44:04,625 --> 01:44:05,583
Hey..
- Is that so?

2050
01:44:05,625 --> 01:44:09,208
Hey.. - And yes, some real
people will be working in this show.

2051
01:44:09,291 --> 01:44:10,791
Don't get scared at all.

2052
01:44:10,833 --> 01:44:12,458
No, no.

2053
01:44:13,625 --> 01:44:15,041
This is a pen camera.

2054
01:44:15,125 --> 01:44:16,791
There is a camera fitted to it.

2055
01:44:18,750 --> 01:44:19,875
Pen camera?

2056
01:44:19,958 --> 01:44:20,708
Yes.

2057
01:44:20,833 --> 01:44:23,916
Hey, this will record what
everyone is doing. - I see.

2058
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,750
Now assume that you
have a camera in the pen.

2059
01:44:26,833 --> 01:44:28,750
And someone will have it in the watch.

2060
01:44:28,833 --> 01:44:30,208
Someone will have a
camera in his collar.

2061
01:44:30,291 --> 01:44:32,000
And yes, someone might have
it in the shirt's button too.

2062
01:44:32,083 --> 01:44:33,333
When does the shooting start?

2063
01:44:33,708 --> 01:44:34,750
From tomorrow.

2064
01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:03,833
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

2065
01:45:08,708 --> 01:45:10,166
He is my friend, Ruidas Pal.

2066
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:11,375
He is the nephew of Haridas Pal..

2067
01:45:11,458 --> 01:45:12,958
..a millionaire of Singapore.

2068
01:45:13,041 --> 01:45:16,291
We are so lucky that we have got
a chance to shake hands with you.

2069
01:45:16,375 --> 01:45:18,500
Now sit down, sit down,
sit down, sit down, sit down.

2070
01:45:25,666 --> 01:45:27,916
So? Let us serve our guests now.

2071
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:28,625
Right?

2072
01:45:28,708 --> 01:45:29,958
I will be the one hosting you.

2073
01:45:30,041 --> 01:45:30,833
Meaning?

2074
01:45:30,916 --> 01:45:32,958
I..
- No, I mean, uncle is trying to say..

2075
01:45:33,041 --> 01:45:34,541
..that all the expenses
will be borne by him today.

2076
01:45:34,708 --> 01:45:36,333
I am right, uncle. Isn't it?

2077
01:45:36,875 --> 01:45:38,041
Didn't I tell you?

2078
01:45:38,125 --> 01:45:41,250
He is Haridas Pal
from Singapore. Star!

2079
01:45:41,333 --> 01:45:42,125
Hey!

2080
01:45:42,208 --> 01:45:43,875
Don't talk rubbish and get the drinks.

2081
01:45:44,291 --> 01:45:45,875
I will get them.

2082
01:45:45,958 --> 01:45:47,458
While the drinks are being served..

2083
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:48,375
..let us talk about business, okay?

2084
01:45:48,458 --> 01:45:48,958
Yes.
- Yes.

2085
01:45:49,041 --> 01:45:49,875
Yes.
- Okay.

2086
01:45:50,416 --> 01:45:53,041
Uncle Hari is opening a
seven star hotel in Singapore.

2087
01:45:53,125 --> 01:45:55,333
And for that, he needs
a lot of liquid cash.

2088
01:45:56,041 --> 01:46:00,458
That is why he has decided to
sell his 200 acres land in Bonga.

2089
01:46:00,541 --> 01:46:04,583
Well, the valuation of that land
is 5 crores per acre at the moment.

2090
01:46:05,041 --> 01:46:08,875
But I have decided I will sell
it off even if I get 3 crores.

2091
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,375
Was it right, nephew?

2092
01:46:10,416 --> 01:46:11,541
You are doing alright till now.

2093
01:46:11,625 --> 01:46:13,416
Cannot you lower it a bit, sir?

2094
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:15,083
I knew you are poor.

2095
01:46:15,375 --> 01:46:17,500
But I didn't know you
are a gang of beggars.

2096
01:46:17,958 --> 01:46:19,708
It is okay. I will
donate it for 2.5 crores.

2097
01:46:19,791 --> 01:46:21,916
I hope the papers are on your name.

2098
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,458
If you have a doubt about
his papers, he will feel bad.

2099
01:46:24,541 --> 01:46:25,958
And if uncle feels bad..

2100
01:46:26,041 --> 01:46:29,041
..the nephew will be very angry.

2101
01:46:29,625 --> 01:46:32,250
And if I am angry..
- Everyone will be in trouble.

2102
01:46:32,333 --> 01:46:33,583
Hey, forget him.

2103
01:46:33,666 --> 01:46:36,041
Actually his papers
weren't right when he was born.

2104
01:46:36,125 --> 01:46:38,750
That is why he is
always worried about papers.

2105
01:46:38,833 --> 01:46:40,750
Here you are, sir.
- Give it.

2106
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,708
Don't worry about the papers.

2107
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:45,541
I will send them in a few days.

2108
01:46:45,875 --> 01:46:47,750
But will you be able to do it?

2109
01:46:48,375 --> 01:46:50,833
Your appearance makes me doubt it.

2110
01:46:50,916 --> 01:46:52,500
Hey, we are just the small fish.

2111
01:46:52,583 --> 01:46:54,541
We have big power behind us.
- Yes.

2112
01:47:18,416 --> 01:47:20,458
Hey, who are you?

2113
01:47:30,916 --> 01:47:34,625
I have come to know the name of
the officer who has killed Bunty.

2114
01:47:34,708 --> 01:47:36,333
Abhiraj Rai.

2115
01:47:36,416 --> 01:47:38,375
He is in Kolkata at the moment.

2116
01:47:38,458 --> 01:47:40,000
This is trouble!

2117
01:47:41,666 --> 01:47:45,000
The one who has this
picture becomes a picture.

2118
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:47,875
Bury this picture in
the ground right now.

2119
01:47:47,958 --> 01:47:50,250
Or else, you will also
get buried in the ground.

2120
01:47:50,333 --> 01:47:51,333
Hey fool..
- Sir.

2121
01:47:51,416 --> 01:47:53,208
I will kill you..
- Hey Shakeel.

2122
01:47:53,291 --> 01:47:54,250
Hey, Shakeel?
- Hey..

2123
01:47:54,333 --> 01:47:56,333
Contract killer Shakeel.
- What?

2124
01:47:56,375 --> 01:47:58,541
When he was with me in the shelter..
- Yes.

2125
01:47:58,583 --> 01:48:01,791
He had this picture in his
hand and wanted to have kebabs.

2126
01:48:01,875 --> 01:48:02,875
Kebab?
- As soon as I gave him kebab..

2127
01:48:02,958 --> 01:48:04,458
..there was a gong..
- Gong?

2128
01:48:04,541 --> 01:48:06,416
The skull got upturned..
- Okay.

2129
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:08,041
There was blood on the kebab..
- What?

2130
01:48:08,166 --> 01:48:10,375
The kebab was ruined..
- And?

2131
01:48:11,458 --> 01:48:12,583
His picture is on the wall.

2132
01:48:12,666 --> 01:48:14,125
There he is..
- I will kill him now.

2133
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:16,083
Hey, hey, hey, go on now.
Go and get some tea.

2134
01:48:16,166 --> 01:48:17,291
Go, go, go..
- Cool.

2135
01:48:17,375 --> 01:48:19,291
Cool.
- Not cool, cool. Hot! Hot!

2136
01:48:19,375 --> 01:48:20,750
Cool.
- Oh no.

2137
01:48:20,833 --> 01:48:21,750
Cool! Cool.

2138
01:48:21,833 --> 01:48:24,166
My brain is becoming hot on
hearing the word cool from him.

2139
01:48:24,250 --> 01:48:27,625
After killing the inspector,
I will kill this Mr. Cool.

2140
01:48:27,916 --> 01:48:31,125
But before that, can I get a phone?

2141
01:48:31,208 --> 01:48:32,291
A phone?

2142
01:48:32,375 --> 01:48:35,750
Arrange for the money as soon
as possible by telling boss.

2143
01:48:35,833 --> 01:48:39,125
Or else, we wouldn't be able
to hold the party for too long.

2144
01:48:39,291 --> 01:48:40,583
Boss.

2145
01:48:41,416 --> 01:48:45,208
The man who has killed my brother..

2146
01:48:45,291 --> 01:48:47,166
..and is making me
run around like a dog..

2147
01:48:47,208 --> 01:48:48,916
..is in Kolkata at the moment.

2148
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,375
I will fax his photograph.

2149
01:48:51,541 --> 01:48:53,125
I need all his details.

2150
01:48:53,166 --> 01:48:55,500
Send his photograph.
I will get his corpse sent.

2151
01:48:55,583 --> 01:48:58,291
But keep this secret
within yourselves.

2152
01:48:58,833 --> 01:49:01,250
No one should be able to hear this.

2153
01:49:01,333 --> 01:49:03,750
No one except the partners
will come to know of it.

2154
01:49:03,958 --> 01:49:05,666
Don't worry at all.

2155
01:49:05,916 --> 01:49:08,541
You are so restless all the time.

2156
01:49:08,625 --> 01:49:10,666
When I see you, I feel
someone is bothering you.

2157
01:49:10,750 --> 01:49:12,375
Hey, hey, hey. Do something.
- Here you are. Take tea.

2158
01:49:12,458 --> 01:49:13,500
Take tea.
- Take this photo and right away.

2159
01:49:13,541 --> 01:49:15,166
Fax this photo to Kolkata right away.

2160
01:49:15,250 --> 01:49:16,916
The fax number is written on this.

2161
01:49:18,458 --> 01:49:21,083
At the end, you have
decided that you want to die.

2162
01:49:21,166 --> 01:49:22,583
Okay, will the body come here..

2163
01:49:22,666 --> 01:49:23,875
..or will it be buried in Kolkata?

2164
01:49:23,958 --> 01:49:25,541
Hey..
- Cool!

2165
01:49:28,666 --> 01:49:29,541
Brother.

2166
01:49:29,625 --> 01:49:31,666
This picture has to be
faxed on this number.

2167
01:49:42,333 --> 01:49:47,666
A nice man like this is making
Guru Nayak run around like dogs?

2168
01:49:53,291 --> 01:49:55,125
How was the game?

2169
01:49:55,291 --> 01:49:57,458
He pointed the gun at me?

2170
01:49:57,500 --> 01:49:58,916
It is a mistake.

2171
01:49:59,041 --> 01:49:59,666
No, no, no, no.

2172
01:49:59,750 --> 01:50:01,375
It is not right to
create a mess of such men.

2173
01:50:01,458 --> 01:50:02,625
The government will fire
me if they come to know..

2174
01:50:02,708 --> 01:50:04,250
..that I am involved in all this.

2175
01:50:04,333 --> 01:50:05,291
In last year's veneration..

2176
01:50:05,375 --> 01:50:06,291
..I had got Robi.

2177
01:50:06,375 --> 01:50:07,625
Nothing seemed amiss to me.

2178
01:50:07,708 --> 01:50:09,000
He was very polite and
addressed me as brother.

2179
01:50:09,083 --> 01:50:10,458
Hey, what should we do now?

2180
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:12,083
Let us give him excuses and bide time.

2181
01:50:12,166 --> 01:50:13,750
And in the meanwhile,
make the land deal final.

2182
01:50:13,833 --> 01:50:16,000
The matter has to be dealt with care.

2183
01:50:16,041 --> 01:50:17,458
It is Guru Nayak's money.

2184
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:18,708
Even if there is a small
amount of problem with accounts..

2185
01:50:18,791 --> 01:50:20,000
..we will have to
account for a lot more.

2186
01:50:20,083 --> 01:50:21,083
Jaga.
- Yes, brother.

2187
01:50:21,166 --> 01:50:23,000
You have a lot of
boys working for you.

2188
01:50:23,083 --> 01:50:25,333
Find out information if Haridas Pal..

2189
01:50:25,416 --> 01:50:28,416
..from Singapore has
land in Bonga or not.

2190
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,458
Abhi. Jaga is talking on the phone.

2191
01:50:37,666 --> 01:50:40,625
Hello. Yes, tell me.

2192
01:50:44,833 --> 01:50:49,416
Okay. Hang up now.
I will look into it.

2193
01:51:15,458 --> 01:51:16,833
Hello.

2194
01:51:16,958 --> 01:51:18,458
Give the phone to Keshto.
- Hey.

2195
01:51:18,916 --> 01:51:21,291
I think the man has
found out something.

2196
01:51:21,375 --> 01:51:23,541
I cannot give this tension to Keshto.

2197
01:51:23,625 --> 01:51:25,541
Then my film wouldn't get made.

2198
01:51:26,791 --> 01:51:30,000
He is busy. Tell me
whatever you want to say.

2199
01:51:30,041 --> 01:51:32,458
Hey fool, this is Jaga here.
Give the phone to Keshto.

2200
01:51:32,541 --> 01:51:34,791
I don't care if you are Jaga or Gaja.

2201
01:51:34,916 --> 01:51:36,458
After knowing the subject..

2202
01:51:36,541 --> 01:51:38,750
..I will decide whether I want
to give the phone to him or not.

2203
01:51:38,833 --> 01:51:41,416
Tell him that Singapore's
Haridas Pal doesn't stay in Bonga.

2204
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:43,666
I know that.
- How did you know that?

2205
01:51:43,750 --> 01:51:47,333
How can one man stay in Bonga
and Singapore at the same time?

2206
01:51:47,416 --> 01:51:49,208
Don't you have brains at all?

2207
01:51:49,291 --> 01:51:52,000
I will smash your head
into the wall and crush it.

2208
01:51:52,083 --> 01:51:53,083
Give the phone to Keshto.

2209
01:51:53,166 --> 01:51:54,375
I have already told you that..

2210
01:51:54,458 --> 01:51:56,791
..I won't give the phone to him
unless I know the subject matter.

2211
01:51:56,916 --> 01:51:59,083
I am telling you nicely. It is
very important. Give the phone to him.

2212
01:51:59,166 --> 01:52:01,375
Hey, your matter is not clear to me.

2213
01:52:01,458 --> 01:52:03,416
So how can I give the phone to him?

2214
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:05,250
Hey, I am telling you nicely
even now. Give the phone to him.

2215
01:52:05,333 --> 01:52:06,583
Fool! Give the phone to him.

2216
01:52:06,666 --> 01:52:07,708
Hi. - Will you give
the phone to him or not?

2217
01:52:07,791 --> 01:52:09,583
This is called stroke of luck.

2218
01:52:09,666 --> 01:52:11,375
The more I think I
will be angry with you..

2219
01:52:11,458 --> 01:52:12,708
..and I wouldn't speak to you..
- Give the phone to him.

2220
01:52:12,791 --> 01:52:14,333
It just doesn't happen.

2221
01:52:14,375 --> 01:52:16,666
Hello. Why are you
looking here and there?

2222
01:52:16,750 --> 01:52:17,750
Are you following someone?

2223
01:52:17,875 --> 01:52:18,583
Okay, tell me.

2224
01:52:18,666 --> 01:52:20,583
Don't you cops have any other work..

2225
01:52:20,666 --> 01:52:22,541
..other than running
behind thieves, goons and mafia?

2226
01:52:22,625 --> 01:52:24,291
I cannot tolerate him anymore..
- What? Police!

2227
01:52:24,333 --> 01:52:25,750
Police!
- You don't have time to meet me.

2228
01:52:25,875 --> 01:52:28,291
But all day, you follow
thieves and robbers around.

2229
01:54:18,958 --> 01:54:20,083
Where are all the people of the house?

2230
01:54:20,166 --> 01:54:21,166
I have done all the calculations.

2231
01:54:21,250 --> 01:54:24,041
It wasn't a right time for
the ones belonging to Aries.

2232
01:54:24,125 --> 01:54:26,083
Because of the effect
of the planetary evil..

2233
01:54:26,166 --> 01:54:27,583
..there is a chance of
accident at the beginning of the year.

2234
01:54:27,666 --> 01:54:29,708
That is why..
- What happened?

2235
01:54:29,750 --> 01:54:32,625
Father. While coming
back from Lucknow..

2236
01:54:32,708 --> 01:54:34,541
..uncle Jaga has met with an accident.

2237
01:54:34,583 --> 01:54:38,083
He is in a very bad state.
- Oh God.

2238
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:41,500
Where is Jaga at the moment?

2239
01:54:45,083 --> 01:54:48,083
Good boy. You got
out in a drunken state.

2240
01:54:48,166 --> 01:54:49,708
Where did you fall flat on your face?

2241
01:54:49,750 --> 01:54:51,291
Yes. Were you flying in the sky?

2242
01:54:51,375 --> 01:54:52,625
Yes?

2243
01:54:54,708 --> 01:54:56,083
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
- What?

2244
01:54:56,166 --> 01:54:57,750
If you open it, he will die.

2245
01:54:57,833 --> 01:54:59,375
I see.

2246
01:55:00,375 --> 01:55:03,416
Why did Jaga go to the terrace of
the shopping mall all of a sudden?

2247
01:55:04,833 --> 01:55:06,541
I think there is
something wrong somewhere.

2248
01:55:13,416 --> 01:55:15,958
Attention. All of
them are going upwards.

2249
01:55:16,041 --> 01:55:17,875
Alert. Alert. Over.

2250
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:24,791
We just got that fool
of Bonga in our hands.

2251
01:55:24,875 --> 01:55:27,583
And this Jaga had to make this mess.

2252
01:55:27,708 --> 01:55:29,000
That is why Rabindranath Tagore said..

2253
01:55:29,083 --> 01:55:31,875
..that walk alone if no
one pays heed to your call.

2254
01:55:31,958 --> 01:55:33,541
Hey, keep quiet.

2255
01:55:33,833 --> 01:55:35,416
You don't know the things you are
supposed to say at a particular time.

2256
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:38,583
You are speaking about walking
alone sitting inside an ICU.

2257
01:55:38,666 --> 01:55:39,750
Have you informed his family?

2258
01:55:39,833 --> 01:55:41,833
Yes, yes, I have.
They are on their way.

2259
01:55:41,916 --> 01:55:44,416
Sir, the doctor has
called you right away.

2260
01:55:44,958 --> 01:55:46,625
Come on, come on.
- Come on.

2261
01:55:48,916 --> 01:55:51,583
They are coming. Take. Take.
Action. Action.

2262
01:55:51,666 --> 01:55:52,875
Come on.

2263
01:55:52,916 --> 01:55:57,458
Doctor. I cannot see my
father in pain, doctor. - Yes.

2264
01:55:57,541 --> 01:55:59,666
Either save my father or kill him.

2265
01:55:59,708 --> 01:56:00,708
Why are you overacting?

2266
01:56:00,791 --> 01:56:01,541
Oh yes.
- Don't overact.

2267
01:56:01,625 --> 01:56:02,916
We have tried our level best.

2268
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,958
Everything is not in our hands.

2269
01:56:05,291 --> 01:56:06,458
You are right.

2270
01:56:06,541 --> 01:56:08,083
But what should we do now..
- Oh brother. Greetings, brother.

2271
01:56:08,208 --> 01:56:10,458
Oh uncle.

2272
01:56:10,791 --> 01:56:13,708
He is uncle Jaga's son.
- I see.

2273
01:56:17,291 --> 01:56:19,291
Father said that when he
comes back from Lucknow..

2274
01:56:19,333 --> 01:56:21,333
..he would come to meet
you when he gets time.

2275
01:56:21,416 --> 01:56:23,541
God knows what happened!

2276
01:56:23,708 --> 01:56:25,208
I am right here.

2277
01:56:25,416 --> 01:56:26,666
I am right here.

2278
01:56:28,125 --> 01:56:31,666
Sit. Please sit. I will
go and inform the doctor.

2279
01:56:31,750 --> 01:56:34,666
Tell him that minister
Krishna Mitra has come.

2280
01:56:40,791 --> 01:56:42,375
Hey, fast, fast.

2281
01:56:43,625 --> 01:56:44,875
Doctor.

2282
01:56:45,083 --> 01:56:47,333
How is the condition at the moment?

2283
01:56:47,958 --> 01:56:50,625
The brain is completely damaged.
He cannot talk.

2284
01:56:50,666 --> 01:56:51,666
He cannot breathe.

2285
01:56:51,750 --> 01:56:53,291
Assume that he is on the last stage.

2286
01:56:54,375 --> 01:56:56,791
Father, I will just go
and have a word with him.

2287
01:57:08,625 --> 01:57:09,958
What is it?

2288
01:57:10,583 --> 01:57:12,958
On seeing me, you are scared?

2289
01:57:14,083 --> 01:57:16,958
If you are in this
condition on seeing me..

2290
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,375
..then imagine..

2291
01:57:18,916 --> 01:57:24,458
Imagine how scared you would be
when you know my father's name.

2292
01:57:25,375 --> 01:57:30,250
My father's name is Debraj Rai.

2293
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:38,166
Before you get into the
electric cremation machine..

2294
01:57:38,250 --> 01:57:40,125
..just get this into your head..

2295
01:57:40,208 --> 01:57:42,583
..that you will die
at my father's hands.

2296
01:57:44,250 --> 01:57:48,041
"Lord's name is true."

2297
01:57:49,583 --> 01:57:52,708
Father. Uncle Jaga wanted to see you.

2298
01:57:54,833 --> 01:57:58,750
"Lord's name is true."

2299
01:58:09,458 --> 01:58:13,208
"Lord's name is true."

2300
01:58:13,291 --> 01:58:17,958
I hadn't thought I will
see you in this condition.

2301
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,291
Father.

2302
01:58:19,375 --> 01:58:21,750
Uncle Jaga has a paper in his hand.

2303
01:58:24,458 --> 01:58:25,958
What.. What is it?

2304
01:58:26,458 --> 01:58:27,791
Is it hurting a lot, uncle?

2305
01:58:27,875 --> 01:58:31,875
Debda, I knew you would come.

2306
01:58:31,958 --> 01:58:34,125
I cannot take this pain anymore.

2307
01:58:34,208 --> 01:58:36,208
Please open my oxygen
mask with your hands..

2308
01:58:36,291 --> 01:58:39,041
..and give me freedom.

2309
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:42,625
This is my last wish.

2310
01:58:42,708 --> 01:58:43,958
Yes..
- Hey, what is this?

2311
01:58:44,083 --> 01:58:45,416
Hey uncle.
- Yes?

2312
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:50,208
Please keep my father's
last wish, uncle. Kill father.

2313
01:58:52,583 --> 01:58:54,791
There, he is saying it.
- How can I do it?

2314
01:58:54,875 --> 01:58:55,958
He is asking you to do it.

2315
01:58:56,083 --> 01:58:58,625
How can I do this to Jaga?
- Father.

2316
01:58:58,708 --> 01:59:00,541
Uncle Jaga is in pain.
- Yes.

2317
01:59:00,625 --> 01:59:03,333
He wants to die at your hands.
- Yes.

2318
01:59:03,541 --> 01:59:07,500
Speak a few holy chants in his ears.

2319
01:59:10,625 --> 01:59:12,750
Hey, swine.

2320
01:59:13,041 --> 01:59:15,791
Do you know why I kept you alive?

2321
01:59:16,208 --> 01:59:18,541
Because I wanted to kill
you using those hands..

2322
01:59:18,625 --> 01:59:21,416
..which had given you
food once upon a time.

2323
01:59:21,916 --> 01:59:26,708
You are not alone. I will
send all of you up there.

2324
01:59:27,208 --> 01:59:30,833
All the ones who have
broken my father's trust.

2325
01:59:32,458 --> 01:59:33,708
Pack up.

2326
01:59:35,166 --> 01:59:37,500
Father. It is done.

2327
01:59:42,250 --> 01:59:46,416
"Lord's name is true."

2328
01:59:53,458 --> 01:59:57,541
"Lord's name is true."

2329
02:00:14,750 --> 02:00:18,500
There was no one else like him.

2330
02:00:19,583 --> 02:00:23,416
He used to finish the whole
bottle of alcohol in one go.

2331
02:00:23,416 --> 02:00:25,958
He never made any judgment
where girls were concerned.

2332
02:00:26,041 --> 02:00:29,583
Yes.
- He used to love everyone equally.

2333
02:00:29,666 --> 02:00:34,083
Why are you so sad?
There is a share less. - Yes.

2334
02:00:34,125 --> 02:00:35,416
Have you informed Biltu?

2335
02:00:35,458 --> 02:00:37,166
I had called him. He is
out of network coverage.

2336
02:00:37,250 --> 02:00:38,458
I see.

2337
02:00:46,458 --> 02:00:48,916
Look at what has happened.

2338
02:00:49,166 --> 02:00:50,375
Yesterday..

2339
02:00:50,583 --> 02:00:53,416
We were talking so much yesterday.
- Yes.

2340
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:56,500
And today, he is a mere picture.

2341
02:00:58,083 --> 02:01:01,708
He was the one
overseeing your uncle's land.

2342
02:01:01,791 --> 02:01:04,375
He has made us sink.

2343
02:01:05,041 --> 02:01:07,541
I can understand your pain.
- Yes.

2344
02:01:07,625 --> 02:01:09,541
But what can be done? Tell me.

2345
02:01:10,166 --> 02:01:13,375
You cannot die along with him, right?
- Yes.

2346
02:01:14,166 --> 02:01:19,375
We should finalize this deal so that
his soul can rest at peace. - Yes.

2347
02:01:19,666 --> 02:01:22,541
I have kept all the
documents and papers in this bag.

2348
02:01:22,625 --> 02:01:24,583
I am giving this to Premjeet.

2349
02:01:24,625 --> 02:01:26,208
After you are done with the rituals..

2350
02:01:26,291 --> 02:01:27,583
..please check the papers.
- Yes.

2351
02:01:27,666 --> 02:01:30,541
Right. Right. You are right.

2352
02:01:30,875 --> 02:01:31,791
Right.

2353
02:01:34,375 --> 02:01:36,916
Yes.
- Please keep this carefully.

2354
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,541
The land's papers are in this.
- I see.

2355
02:01:39,625 --> 02:01:42,708
After Jaga's ceremony,
give this to them. - Yes.

2356
02:01:43,333 --> 02:01:44,708
Okay.

2357
02:01:45,375 --> 02:01:48,416
And yes, I have some good news.
- What is it?

2358
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:50,541
Koel Mallick has
agreed to do this movie.

2359
02:01:50,625 --> 02:01:53,000
"Liar."
- Really? - Yes.

2360
02:01:53,250 --> 02:01:55,708
She jumped when she saw your pictures.

2361
02:01:55,791 --> 02:01:57,333
And do you know what she said?

2362
02:01:57,375 --> 02:01:58,583
He is super attractive.

2363
02:01:58,666 --> 02:02:00,958
"It is a 100% love, love, love."
- Super hot. And yes.

2364
02:02:01,041 --> 02:02:04,333
And to do this movie, she
has left three other movies.

2365
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:06,500
Among them, she had a movie
with Hrithik Roshan movie too.

2366
02:02:06,541 --> 02:02:08,041
"Love, love, love, love, love."
- All the best.

2367
02:02:08,125 --> 02:02:11,291
"It is a 100% love, love, love."

2368
02:02:12,916 --> 02:02:13,750
Father.
- Yes?

2369
02:02:13,875 --> 02:02:15,208
How are you feeling?

2370
02:02:16,208 --> 02:02:17,833
Are you very busy?

2371
02:02:18,333 --> 02:02:21,833
I don't get to know when you
are leaving and coming back.

2372
02:02:21,916 --> 02:02:23,541
No, father. There is pressure at work.

2373
02:02:23,625 --> 02:02:25,625
Yes, it is a police job.

2374
02:02:25,708 --> 02:02:27,666
He is under pressure all the time.

2375
02:02:27,750 --> 02:02:30,333
Abhi works with the police?

2376
02:02:30,416 --> 02:02:32,958
No, no, father. Uncle
isn't talking about me.

2377
02:02:33,041 --> 02:02:34,375
What is it, uncle? Tell him.
- What?

2378
02:02:34,458 --> 02:02:37,416
No, no, no, I am talking
about his father-in-law.

2379
02:02:38,625 --> 02:02:40,291
Abhi's father-in-law.

2380
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
Would be.. Would be.

2381
02:02:44,958 --> 02:02:48,625
Our Abhi loves a girl
from Mumbai. Her father.

2382
02:02:48,666 --> 02:02:50,083
He is a very big police officer.

2383
02:02:50,166 --> 02:02:52,583
He has a wish of
having an MLA son-in-law.

2384
02:02:53,083 --> 02:02:54,333
I see.

2385
02:02:57,250 --> 02:02:59,791
You have kept such big
news hidden from me?

2386
02:02:59,875 --> 02:03:01,416
How does the girl look?

2387
02:03:01,500 --> 02:03:03,333
She is quite good.

2388
02:03:03,583 --> 02:03:05,250
Quite?

2389
02:03:05,625 --> 02:03:07,250
What kind of an answer is that?

2390
02:03:07,583 --> 02:03:10,791
No, no, I want to see
daughter-in-law once.

2391
02:03:12,291 --> 02:03:14,166
Get daughter-in-law once. Okay?

2392
02:03:14,416 --> 02:03:15,666
Okay.
- Hey!

2393
02:03:16,041 --> 02:03:17,500
Why didn't you tell me for so long?

2394
02:03:17,583 --> 02:03:21,958
Now look. I wouldn't
squeal so easily. Yes.

2395
02:03:22,500 --> 02:03:25,500
Hey Shibu. Shibu!

2396
02:03:27,041 --> 02:03:28,333
Shibu.

2397
02:03:29,250 --> 02:03:31,041
Hey Anand.
- Yes?

2398
02:03:31,125 --> 02:03:33,083
This was the first time
you gave out a secret and..

2399
02:03:33,125 --> 02:03:34,916
..did something useful.

2400
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:36,750
Good.
- What?

2401
02:03:36,833 --> 02:03:37,833
Abhi.
- Yes?

2402
02:03:37,916 --> 02:03:40,666
Brother would be
happiest when you get married.

2403
02:03:40,875 --> 02:03:45,375
Your wife should come at
the same time as the Goddess.

2404
02:03:49,958 --> 02:03:51,333
What is it?

2405
02:03:51,958 --> 02:03:53,208
What did you think?

2406
02:03:53,500 --> 02:03:55,791
I wanted to talk to Puja.

2407
02:03:56,416 --> 02:03:59,041
Puja has her father above
her head as her umbrella.

2408
02:03:59,750 --> 02:04:01,416
Place the subject matter first.

2409
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:03,416
We will talk about it
when this gets approved.

2410
02:04:05,208 --> 02:04:08,458
Puja. I don't sprinkle
water on top of a plant.

2411
02:04:08,500 --> 02:04:10,083
I sprinkle water on the roots.

2412
02:04:10,208 --> 02:04:12,250
That is why I will tell
you whatever has to be said.

2413
02:04:12,750 --> 02:04:14,916
Even I am getting good alliances.

2414
02:04:15,583 --> 02:04:18,000
Some of them have
fathers who are ministers..

2415
02:04:18,083 --> 02:04:20,375
..joint CP, magistrate..

2416
02:04:20,541 --> 02:04:23,375
Compared to that, your father is..

2417
02:04:23,458 --> 02:04:26,708
Anyway, good or bad..

2418
02:04:27,041 --> 02:04:28,541
..I will marry you.

2419
02:04:29,458 --> 02:04:31,166
I have fallen in love.

2420
02:04:31,666 --> 02:04:33,750
If you have fallen in love too..

2421
02:04:34,583 --> 02:04:36,500
..ask the head to settle the rest.

2422
02:04:36,583 --> 02:04:40,458
Is this proposing or setting the
criminal and making him confess?

2423
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:41,541
He is so rude before marriage.

2424
02:04:41,625 --> 02:04:42,750
How will he be after marriage?

2425
02:04:42,833 --> 02:04:44,750
You have come into the
wrong house. Forgive me.

2426
02:04:44,833 --> 02:04:47,000
He has come to the
right house, father.

2427
02:04:47,541 --> 02:04:49,541
I love this rude man.

2428
02:04:49,750 --> 02:04:51,041
What?

2429
02:04:52,500 --> 02:04:54,083
I will marry him if I have to.

2430
02:04:54,458 --> 02:04:57,958
He is insulting you
throughout in front of my eyes.

2431
02:04:58,041 --> 02:04:59,291
And you want to marry him?

2432
02:04:59,375 --> 02:05:02,000
Father. Please listen.
- Oh no. No.

2433
02:05:02,083 --> 02:05:03,750
Listen.
- What is it?

2434
02:05:04,541 --> 02:05:06,541
That is his problem.
- What?

2435
02:05:06,625 --> 02:05:09,875
He thinks he is a bigger
police inspector than you.

2436
02:05:10,208 --> 02:05:11,166
Yes.

2437
02:05:11,250 --> 02:05:14,541
And not just that, he thinks
he is smarter than me too.

2438
02:05:14,625 --> 02:05:17,375
That is why girls
are queuing up for him.

2439
02:05:17,666 --> 02:05:20,458
He is too proud of himself.

2440
02:05:21,208 --> 02:05:23,250
Hey, that is the
reason I want to marry him.

2441
02:05:23,333 --> 02:05:24,416
I see.

2442
02:05:24,458 --> 02:05:27,625
I will get him down to the earth.
- I see.

2443
02:05:27,708 --> 02:05:29,083
But what if he doesn't
want to get down to earth?

2444
02:05:29,166 --> 02:05:30,750
And keeps feeling proud of himself?

2445
02:05:30,833 --> 02:05:33,583
Don't worry, I am your daughter.
- Yes.

2446
02:05:33,625 --> 02:05:35,541
I will show him Malaysia's
colors and get him down.

2447
02:05:36,791 --> 02:05:39,083
You are truly
Byomkesh Bakshi's daughter.

2448
02:05:41,375 --> 02:05:43,000
Okay, I don't have a problem..

2449
02:05:43,083 --> 02:05:46,000
..since both of you
are in the same knot now.

2450
02:05:46,291 --> 02:05:48,666
But there is a condition.
- Okay.

2451
02:05:48,750 --> 02:05:49,791
I will meet your family first.

2452
02:05:49,916 --> 02:05:54,125
And then I will decide if
clarinets will play in your wedding.

2453
02:05:54,208 --> 02:05:55,500
Or violin.

2454
02:05:56,125 --> 02:05:59,458
Oh, why are you getting so restless?

2455
02:05:59,500 --> 02:06:00,791
Let me do something.

2456
02:06:00,916 --> 02:06:04,666
Let me tell them everything and
ask them to co-operate with us.

2457
02:06:05,208 --> 02:06:07,958
Impossible. You don't know that man.

2458
02:06:08,333 --> 02:06:10,000
He is a different man altogether.

2459
02:06:10,333 --> 02:06:13,333
If that fool comes to know
that I have lied to my father..

2460
02:06:13,375 --> 02:06:15,500
..he will never get
me married to Puja.

2461
02:06:15,583 --> 02:06:17,791
On the contrary, he will
blame me for everything.

2462
02:06:18,458 --> 02:06:20,500
I am scared because of Anand.

2463
02:06:20,541 --> 02:06:22,083
He is a bigmouth.

2464
02:06:22,375 --> 02:06:23,750
If the bigmouth speaks the truth..

2465
02:06:23,875 --> 02:06:25,208
..we will be done for.

2466
02:06:25,291 --> 02:06:26,458
I have got a way.

2467
02:06:27,166 --> 02:06:28,541
For all this while, we have
fallen into trouble because..

2468
02:06:28,625 --> 02:06:30,625
..of uncle Anand being a bigmouth.

2469
02:06:30,708 --> 02:06:32,500
But because of that bigmouth..

2470
02:06:32,583 --> 02:06:34,541
..we will be saved from trouble now.

2471
02:06:37,666 --> 02:06:38,625
Come.

2472
02:06:38,708 --> 02:06:39,541
Did he tell you the
time he is going to come?

2473
02:06:39,625 --> 02:06:40,708
I don't know..
- He will come. He will come.

2474
02:06:40,750 --> 02:06:41,791
Hey Abhi.

2475
02:06:41,875 --> 02:06:43,125
Hello, sir.

2476
02:06:43,500 --> 02:06:45,708
I hope you didn't have a
problem while looking for the house.

2477
02:06:45,750 --> 02:06:48,000
No, at the beginning, I thought
I have come to the right house.

2478
02:06:48,083 --> 02:06:50,166
Now when I have seen you,
I feel a little confused.

2479
02:06:50,291 --> 02:06:51,625
Why are you dressed like this?

2480
02:06:51,708 --> 02:06:53,083
Are you a cop or an actor?

2481
02:06:53,166 --> 02:06:54,750
Lower it. Lower it.

2482
02:06:56,250 --> 02:06:58,833
Actually I want to
tell you something..

2483
02:06:58,916 --> 02:07:00,958
..before you meet my family, sir.
- What?

2484
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,583
Actually I have an uncle. Uncle Anand.

2485
02:07:03,666 --> 02:07:04,791
He stays here.

2486
02:07:04,875 --> 02:07:07,875
But uncle is a little demented.

2487
02:07:08,666 --> 02:07:10,291
He gets hold of each person each day.

2488
02:07:10,375 --> 02:07:12,875
And for that day, we have
to abide by what he says.

2489
02:07:13,041 --> 02:07:15,750
And if we don't listen
to him, he bites - What?

2490
02:07:16,041 --> 02:07:20,291
What? Who is he after today?

2491
02:07:20,500 --> 02:07:22,291
Me.
- What?

2492
02:07:22,791 --> 02:07:25,000
He says I am an MLA of Debnagar.

2493
02:07:25,083 --> 02:07:26,875
And I have a chance of being
the chief minister one day.

2494
02:07:26,958 --> 02:07:28,541
Okay, that is all, right?

2495
02:07:28,625 --> 02:07:31,750
Yes, sir. But there is
something I want to say, sir.

2496
02:07:31,833 --> 02:07:35,625
What? - You have to handle
my uncle a little carefully.

2497
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,625
Hey, don't worry.

2498
02:07:38,458 --> 02:07:40,458
Although my name is
Madhusudan Bakshi..

2499
02:07:40,541 --> 02:07:42,625
..I am Byomkesh Bakshi, the detective.

2500
02:07:42,666 --> 02:07:44,500
I have handles thieves,
robbers and goons all this while.

2501
02:07:44,583 --> 02:07:46,208
Do you think I wouldn't be able
to handle an ordinary mad man?

2502
02:07:46,291 --> 02:07:49,083
Don't worry at all.
- Thank you, sir.

2503
02:07:49,250 --> 02:07:51,041
Hey. Come on.

2504
02:07:51,333 --> 02:07:52,708
Too much.

2505
02:07:56,625 --> 02:07:58,208
Yes, I didn't know at that time..

2506
02:07:58,291 --> 02:07:59,333
..that I am the father of the girl.

2507
02:07:59,416 --> 02:08:00,625
I was abusing myself.

2508
02:08:00,708 --> 02:08:02,500
Greetings, greetings, greetings.

2509
02:08:02,583 --> 02:08:04,625
Greetings.
- Yes. - Who is he?

2510
02:08:04,708 --> 02:08:05,541
I? I..
- Yes.

2511
02:08:05,625 --> 02:08:06,958
I am Abhi's uncle.

2512
02:08:07,041 --> 02:08:08,916
I see. I see. Okay, okay.
- Yes.

2513
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:09,916
Greetings. Is everything fine?

2514
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,458
Yes, I mean..

2515
02:08:12,666 --> 02:08:15,500
I think the man knows
everything about me.

2516
02:08:15,583 --> 02:08:17,875
What is he asking about? Tell me.

2517
02:08:17,958 --> 02:08:19,541
Abhi has told him that..
- Yes?

2518
02:08:19,625 --> 02:08:21,625
You are after this marriage.

2519
02:08:21,666 --> 02:08:23,208
He has told him?
- Yes.

2520
02:08:23,291 --> 02:08:25,708
That is why.. - That is
the reason he looks so happy.

2521
02:08:25,791 --> 02:08:26,708
He is the girl's father.

2522
02:08:26,791 --> 02:08:28,500
It is a girl's responsibility.

2523
02:08:28,750 --> 02:08:31,291
Okay, do they know
everything about Debda?

2524
02:08:31,375 --> 02:08:33,125
They know everything.
- Yes.

2525
02:08:33,166 --> 02:08:35,958
Don't say anything
in front of everyone.

2526
02:08:36,041 --> 02:08:37,458
Relative.

2527
02:08:38,041 --> 02:08:40,125
I am not saying this
because he is my own son.

2528
02:08:40,333 --> 02:08:42,583
At such a young age,
such brave leaders..

2529
02:08:42,666 --> 02:08:44,458
..don't exist in West Bengal.

2530
02:08:44,541 --> 02:08:46,708
I have heard that when he
talks in the legislative assembly..

2531
02:08:46,791 --> 02:08:48,166
..it gets shaken.

2532
02:08:48,250 --> 02:08:49,875
I see.
- Not just that.

2533
02:08:49,958 --> 02:08:52,833
On seeing him, girls and boys
don't want to take up jobs anymore.

2534
02:08:52,916 --> 02:08:54,958
Really?
- They are saying that they want to..

2535
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,958
..go to the legislative assembly
as soon as they finish college.

2536
02:08:59,375 --> 02:09:01,375
Not just the head. He has a
problem with his eyes as well.

2537
02:09:01,458 --> 02:09:05,750
Yes. Yes, he is on the T.V, papers..

2538
02:09:05,833 --> 02:09:07,625
He is always being..

2539
02:09:07,708 --> 02:09:10,125
Model. Model..
- Role model.

2540
02:09:10,583 --> 02:09:12,083
Young generation thinks of him..

2541
02:09:12,166 --> 02:09:13,875
..as the future Chief
minister from now on.

2542
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Why is your
father-in-law winking at me?

2543
02:09:17,125 --> 02:09:18,166
Wink?

2544
02:09:18,250 --> 02:09:20,500
I see. No, no. He isn't winking.

2545
02:09:20,541 --> 02:09:22,125
He has an ailment of the eyes.

2546
02:09:22,208 --> 02:09:23,541
It closes on its own.

2547
02:09:23,583 --> 02:09:24,791
I see.
- Got it?

2548
02:09:24,875 --> 02:09:27,291
The more younger
people come to politics..

2549
02:09:27,333 --> 02:09:29,416
..the better it is for
the politics, right?

2550
02:09:29,500 --> 02:09:32,500
Or else, the way the country
is running like a slow train..

2551
02:09:32,541 --> 02:09:35,333
..in some time, it will be dead.

2552
02:09:37,875 --> 02:09:38,791
Hey.

2553
02:09:38,875 --> 02:09:41,250
Abhi's father-in-law winked at me.

2554
02:09:41,333 --> 02:09:42,583
What?
- Have another glass of juice.

2555
02:09:42,666 --> 02:09:45,458
Okay, are we at home or
the legislative assembly?

2556
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:48,666
Can we leave politics aside
and finalize the wedding date?

2557
02:09:48,750 --> 02:09:49,625
Right, right.

2558
02:09:49,708 --> 02:09:50,833
Relative.
- Yes?

2559
02:09:50,916 --> 02:09:52,333
I was saying that we should finalize..

2560
02:09:52,416 --> 02:09:53,750
..the wedding date
as soon as possible.

2561
02:09:53,833 --> 02:09:56,416
Yes, as soon as you
finalize the date..

2562
02:09:56,500 --> 02:09:59,291
..we have to go to Delhi to
invite Manmohan and Sonia.

2563
02:09:59,375 --> 02:10:00,333
We will take you too.

2564
02:10:00,416 --> 02:10:01,708
We will introduce you.

2565
02:10:01,791 --> 02:10:04,791
We are regular
visitors to their place.

2566
02:10:04,833 --> 02:10:07,166
'It is okay up to Manmohan and Sonia.'

2567
02:10:07,333 --> 02:10:08,833
'After this, he will say
that Barrack Obama will come..'

2568
02:10:08,916 --> 02:10:10,500
'..for Abhi's wedding.'

2569
02:10:10,583 --> 02:10:12,083
'I think he might bite me
if I say that I won't go.'

2570
02:10:12,166 --> 02:10:14,916
Sure. I will go
wherever you ask me to go.

2571
02:10:15,041 --> 02:10:16,291
Okay, shall we leave?

2572
02:10:16,375 --> 02:10:17,291
Yes?
- Yes. Okay.

2573
02:10:17,375 --> 02:10:18,458
Please leave.
- We are leaving.

2574
02:10:18,500 --> 02:10:20,750
Please come to our house once. Okay.
- We will come for sure.

2575
02:10:20,833 --> 02:10:22,833
Abhi, we are leaving.
- Come, come. This side. Please.

2576
02:10:22,916 --> 02:10:23,750
Come on.

2577
02:10:23,833 --> 02:10:24,625
Anand.
- Yes?

2578
02:10:24,708 --> 02:10:27,250
Even I will take you
somewhere for invitations.

2579
02:10:27,291 --> 02:10:28,541
Amitabh Bacchan.
- What?

2580
02:10:28,625 --> 02:10:31,000
We go to his place regularly.

2581
02:10:35,875 --> 02:10:37,333
Brother.

2582
02:10:37,916 --> 02:10:39,333
Brother.

2583
02:10:39,750 --> 02:10:42,541
Brother, cancel this wedding.

2584
02:10:42,625 --> 02:10:43,666
Why?

2585
02:10:44,333 --> 02:10:45,583
Didn't you like the girl?

2586
02:10:45,666 --> 02:10:47,041
The girl is good.

2587
02:10:47,125 --> 02:10:48,000
But the father?

2588
02:10:48,083 --> 02:10:50,333
Father was winking at
everyone like an uncouth man.

2589
02:10:50,416 --> 02:10:53,500
Hey, no, her father
has an eye ailment.

2590
02:10:53,583 --> 02:10:54,875
Abhi has told me.

2591
02:11:10,333 --> 02:11:14,583
Does the girl also have a
habit of winking like her father?

2592
02:11:15,083 --> 02:11:17,083
Yes?
- This is something different.

2593
02:11:26,083 --> 02:11:28,625
Hey, get down from the car.
- Why?

2594
02:11:29,083 --> 02:11:31,666
Hey, I asked you to get down,
get down. - Hey, don't talk rudely.

2595
02:11:31,708 --> 02:11:33,041
Hey, get down.
- Hey!

2596
02:11:33,125 --> 02:11:34,833
Hey, I am telling you to get down..
- Let go.

2597
02:11:34,916 --> 02:11:36,291
Hey, move.

2598
02:11:36,583 --> 02:11:39,541
Brother, where is Sonajuri?

2599
02:11:39,833 --> 02:11:40,916
That side. That side.

2600
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,125
This side? Then go that side.

2601
02:11:44,208 --> 02:11:45,583
Hey!

2602
02:11:48,041 --> 02:11:50,541
Get out. Let go.

2603
02:11:50,625 --> 02:11:52,541
Be cool! Cool.

2604
02:11:52,625 --> 02:11:54,833
Cool? Inside.

2605
02:11:57,875 --> 02:12:00,708
Oh greetings, brother
Guru Nayak. Greetings.

2606
02:12:00,791 --> 02:12:03,583
I have seen God after a long time.
You have lost a lot of weight.

2607
02:12:03,625 --> 02:12:05,125
Don't speak rubbish and
tell me about the one..

2608
02:12:05,250 --> 02:12:06,750
..whose picture I had sent you.

2609
02:12:06,791 --> 02:12:08,458
We get information on him everyday.
- Yes.

2610
02:12:08,541 --> 02:12:10,291
He has gone abroad with his family.

2611
02:12:10,375 --> 02:12:11,791
And will come after the veneration.
- Yes.

2612
02:12:11,875 --> 02:12:13,750
I have to give you some
other news, brother Guru.

2613
02:12:13,833 --> 02:12:18,166
What is it? - There is a land
in hand. In Bonga. 200 acres.

2614
02:12:18,250 --> 02:12:20,291
We will get the registry
done if you give consent.

2615
02:12:20,375 --> 02:12:21,625
Yes.

2616
02:12:21,833 --> 02:12:22,750
Okay.

2617
02:12:22,833 --> 02:12:25,250
Look at the papers carefully
and make the deal final. - Okay.

2618
02:12:25,333 --> 02:12:27,375
We have the papers in hand.

2619
02:12:27,458 --> 02:12:29,708
You can call your lawyer.

2620
02:12:29,750 --> 02:12:31,500
Prem.
- Yes.

2621
02:12:31,708 --> 02:12:33,000
Tell me.

2622
02:12:34,083 --> 02:12:36,000
Where are the papers?

2623
02:12:36,083 --> 02:12:38,125
Which papers?
- Of the land of Bonga.

2624
02:12:38,208 --> 02:12:40,083
The ones which were given to
you by Haridas Pal's nephew.

2625
02:12:40,208 --> 02:12:41,708
When? When was it?

2626
02:12:41,791 --> 02:12:42,666
Hey, what do you mean by that?

2627
02:12:42,750 --> 02:12:45,250
The day Jaga died. He
gave the papers to you.

2628
02:12:45,333 --> 02:12:46,666
Hey, I have forgotten
where I have kept them.

2629
02:12:46,750 --> 02:12:48,125
What do you mean, fool? You
have forgotten them? - Hey, hey..

2630
02:12:48,250 --> 02:12:49,791
Did you forget them..
- Why are you hitting him?

2631
02:12:49,875 --> 02:12:51,333
You are going overboard.
- Don't touch me, I say.

2632
02:12:51,416 --> 02:12:52,083
Look, brother..
- Hey, quiet.

2633
02:12:52,208 --> 02:12:53,333
You will fall into trouble..
- Please calm down.

2634
02:12:53,416 --> 02:12:54,083
Quiet.
- Yes.

2635
02:12:54,208 --> 02:12:55,083
Don't say a word.
- Don't hit me.

2636
02:12:55,208 --> 02:12:56,541
You are joking around here?
- Stop. What are you doing here?

2637
02:12:56,625 --> 02:12:57,875
What are you doing?

2638
02:12:57,958 --> 02:12:59,375
Do you want to die by hitting him?

2639
02:12:59,458 --> 02:13:01,666
Have you forgotten that you have
had two heart attacks? - What?

2640
02:13:01,708 --> 02:13:03,583
The doctor has asked
you not to get excited.

2641
02:13:03,666 --> 02:13:04,791
Come on, come on. Come on right now.

2642
02:13:04,875 --> 02:13:06,583
I will get the papers again.
- Come on.

2643
02:13:06,791 --> 02:13:09,958
He shouldn't come in
front of me again. The swine.

2644
02:13:10,250 --> 02:13:12,875
I had thought I will get all
the money from brother today.

2645
02:13:13,625 --> 02:13:14,416
Okay.

2646
02:13:14,500 --> 02:13:16,708
I said that I will get all
the papers from uncle Keshto.

2647
02:13:16,750 --> 02:13:17,958
Or else I will get
them from the court.

2648
02:13:18,041 --> 02:13:19,416
Hey, that will
happen after veneration.

2649
02:13:19,500 --> 02:13:20,958
What if within ten days..

2650
02:13:24,250 --> 02:13:25,583
Forgive me, sir.

2651
02:13:29,166 --> 02:13:30,458
Father. Father.
- Father. Father.

2652
02:13:30,541 --> 02:13:31,583
Father. Father.
- Father. Father.

2653
02:13:31,625 --> 02:13:32,958
Hospital..
- Take the car to the hospital.

2654
02:13:33,041 --> 02:13:35,000
Make it fast.
- Take it to the hospital.

2655
02:13:37,875 --> 02:13:39,166
Father.

2656
02:13:39,958 --> 02:13:42,041
You will have to come with me once.

2657
02:13:43,291 --> 02:13:44,500
Where?

2658
02:13:44,666 --> 02:13:47,041
Do you remember Apurbo Ghosh?
- A..

2659
02:13:47,166 --> 02:13:49,083
Apurbo Ghosh?

2660
02:13:49,208 --> 02:13:50,750
He had a business of fake medicines.

2661
02:13:50,833 --> 02:13:51,875
Do you remember, brother?

2662
02:13:51,916 --> 02:13:54,333
The one whose warehouse
had been set to fire by us.

2663
02:13:54,750 --> 02:13:56,250
Apurbo Ghosh is dead.

2664
02:13:56,333 --> 02:13:57,000
How?

2665
02:13:57,125 --> 02:13:58,416
Heart attack, father.

2666
02:14:13,333 --> 02:14:14,791
Father.
- Yes?

2667
02:14:14,958 --> 02:14:16,208
Please sit here for some time.

2668
02:14:16,291 --> 02:14:18,208
I will go and check where he is.

2669
02:14:20,416 --> 02:14:22,583
Blood pressure is very high.
Be careful about him.

2670
02:14:22,666 --> 02:14:25,000
I will come tomorrow in the
morning again. - Thank you, doctor.

2671
02:14:25,666 --> 02:14:27,583
Did you hear what the
doctor said, father?

2672
02:14:27,583 --> 02:14:29,458
Keep lying here for
some days peacefully.

2673
02:14:29,541 --> 02:14:31,000
Or else you will be dead.

2674
02:14:31,125 --> 02:14:32,583
Oh, why are you getting worried?

2675
02:14:32,666 --> 02:14:34,458
We will take care of everything.

2676
02:14:34,625 --> 02:14:38,250
Listen, the senior
doctor is calling you.

2677
02:14:45,958 --> 02:14:48,541
What is this? You?

2678
02:14:49,083 --> 02:14:51,625
Hey, please stay with for
me for some time, brother.

2679
02:14:51,791 --> 02:14:56,500
I mean, till the time my sons
don't meet the doctor and come back.

2680
02:14:56,541 --> 02:14:58,791
Yes. Yes, yes.

2681
02:14:58,875 --> 02:15:01,375
Even when Jaga passed away,
this had happened.

2682
02:15:01,833 --> 02:15:06,291
They had called us to
meet the senior doctor.

2683
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:09,875
And when we came back,
we saw that Jaga was dead.

2684
02:15:09,958 --> 02:15:12,333
Do you think you will
die in the similar way?

2685
02:15:13,416 --> 02:15:14,583
In that case, you are right.

2686
02:15:14,666 --> 02:15:17,833
Hey! Hey, hey, hey,
are you joking with me?

2687
02:15:17,916 --> 02:15:20,500
You are not my brother-in-law,
or friend or pal.

2688
02:15:20,750 --> 02:15:23,208
Why would I joke with you?
- Hey, who are you? Who are you?

2689
02:15:23,291 --> 02:15:24,625
Police.
- What?

2690
02:15:24,708 --> 02:15:26,833
IPS Abhiraj Rai.

2691
02:15:26,916 --> 02:15:29,208
Son of Debraj Rai.
- I see.

2692
02:15:29,583 --> 02:15:32,125
I feel like putting the
gun inside your mouth..

2693
02:15:32,208 --> 02:15:34,458
..and shooting off all the
bullets into your stomach.

2694
02:15:34,500 --> 02:15:36,416
Fool..
- Hey, no, no.

2695
02:15:36,500 --> 02:15:40,333
I want the God like man,
whom all of you wanted to kill..

2696
02:15:40,416 --> 02:15:42,500
..give you your death.

2697
02:15:42,541 --> 02:15:45,166
He..
- Jaga is dead.

2698
02:15:46,250 --> 02:15:49,166
Now you will also die.

2699
02:15:49,833 --> 02:15:53,333
And all those who had
joined together to kill him..

2700
02:15:53,416 --> 02:15:57,291
..will be killed by me
at his hands one by one.

2701
02:15:57,375 --> 02:16:01,250
Don't you want to see
that God once before dying?

2702
02:16:02,125 --> 02:16:04,625
Will you be able to tolerate it?

2703
02:16:05,541 --> 02:16:06,541
Look there.

2704
02:16:06,625 --> 02:16:09,750
"The name of the Lord is true."

2705
02:16:09,833 --> 02:16:12,708
"Lord."

2706
02:16:17,250 --> 02:16:21,041
"The name of the Lord is true."

2707
02:16:21,125 --> 02:16:24,875
"Hey Lord."

2708
02:16:37,166 --> 02:16:38,833
Come on, fast. Fast. Come on.

2709
02:16:38,916 --> 02:16:41,083
Come on, go in fast. Come on.
- Father..

2710
02:16:41,208 --> 02:16:42,208
Father.
- What happened, father?

2711
02:16:42,333 --> 02:16:44,333
Where did you go leaving us behind?

2712
02:16:44,416 --> 02:16:45,875
Father..
- Brother, don't cry, brother.

2713
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:47,666
Father. - If you cry, who
will look after your sister?

2714
02:16:47,750 --> 02:16:49,375
Yes?
- Father.

2715
02:16:49,541 --> 02:16:50,750
Go.

2716
02:16:59,166 --> 02:17:00,416
Brother.

2717
02:17:02,416 --> 02:17:06,041
"The name of the Lord is true."

2718
02:17:06,083 --> 02:17:09,625
"The name of the Lord is true."

2719
02:17:09,708 --> 02:17:13,375
"The name of the Lord is true."

2720
02:17:13,416 --> 02:17:17,083
"The name of the Lord is true."

2721
02:17:17,166 --> 02:17:21,125
"The name of the Lord is true."

2722
02:17:21,541 --> 02:17:25,375
Characters of reality
shows have to die as well?

2723
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:27,375
The show is about mafia, right?

2724
02:17:27,458 --> 02:17:30,375
Sometimes people have to be
killed in order to increase TRPS.

2725
02:17:30,416 --> 02:17:31,250
What?

2726
02:17:31,333 --> 02:17:35,125
"Golden Lotus."

2727
02:17:36,041 --> 02:17:37,625
You are acting well, brother.

2728
02:17:37,708 --> 02:17:40,750
But however good a job you do here..

2729
02:17:40,833 --> 02:17:43,041
"Golden Lotus."
- Rupees 4 crores will be mine.

2730
02:17:43,125 --> 02:17:45,708
Mithoon and Mimo are on my side.

2731
02:17:48,583 --> 02:17:52,208
What is your uncle
saying to the dead body?

2732
02:17:52,708 --> 02:17:53,750
He is saying the holy chants.

2733
02:17:53,833 --> 02:17:55,708
You didn't understand.

2734
02:17:56,375 --> 02:17:59,416
You were thrown out as a strategy.
- "Golden Lotus."

2735
02:17:59,500 --> 02:18:01,750
All of this is the
cleaver boy's game plan.

2736
02:18:08,125 --> 02:18:09,666
He is gone.

2737
02:18:11,750 --> 02:18:13,000
He is gone.

2738
02:18:14,375 --> 02:18:15,750
Oh no.

2739
02:18:17,041 --> 02:18:18,750
You are left now.
- What?

2740
02:18:18,833 --> 02:18:20,958
And the one who is protecting you.

2741
02:18:21,791 --> 02:18:25,166
No, I mean, I am talking
about the land of Bonga.

2742
02:18:25,250 --> 02:18:26,541
I see.

2743
02:18:26,791 --> 02:18:28,791
Be careful.

2744
02:18:34,291 --> 02:18:36,875
After a long time, veneration
will take place in this house.

2745
02:18:37,500 --> 02:18:39,375
You have been with
father since a long time.

2746
02:18:39,666 --> 02:18:42,041
Now I need your help.

2747
02:18:43,666 --> 02:18:47,166
Only you know how the veneration
used to take place in this house.

2748
02:18:47,916 --> 02:18:49,666
There shouldn't be an error anywhere.

2749
02:18:49,750 --> 02:18:50,583
There wouldn't any error anywhere.

2750
02:18:50,666 --> 02:18:51,791
Everything will be done
according to the rules.

2751
02:18:51,875 --> 02:18:52,916
What did you say?
- Yes?

2752
02:18:52,958 --> 02:18:55,250
Hey, I cannot hear you properly.

2753
02:18:55,333 --> 02:18:58,208
Hey, by asking for some time,
you have covered a whole year.

2754
02:18:58,291 --> 02:19:00,958
I have postponed Abhi's
wedding for your sake.

2755
02:19:01,041 --> 02:19:02,916
Now you are telling me you
cannot come for the veneration too.

2756
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,166
This is strange. Hey!

2757
02:19:05,458 --> 02:19:07,666
I don't understand what you are doing.

2758
02:19:07,750 --> 02:19:09,000
Here, talk to Akhil.

2759
02:19:09,083 --> 02:19:09,916
Akhil, listen to what he is saying.

2760
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:11,166
I can't understand anything.
- Yes.

2761
02:19:11,250 --> 02:19:12,125
I will take care of that side.
- Yes.

2762
02:19:12,208 --> 02:19:13,916
Okay? Look after it.
- Yes.

2763
02:19:14,083 --> 02:19:15,458
Hey Shomol. Laltu.

2764
02:19:15,541 --> 02:19:16,375
You are here?
- Yes, brother.

2765
02:19:16,500 --> 02:19:18,708
Listen, tell everyone.

2766
02:19:18,791 --> 02:19:21,750
For four days of the veneration,
they have to eat and live here.

2767
02:19:21,833 --> 02:19:22,708
Okay?

2768
02:19:22,791 --> 02:19:26,708
And on the final day, poor
people will be given clothes.

2769
02:19:26,791 --> 02:19:28,041
Just as it used to happen at my time.

2770
02:19:28,125 --> 02:19:29,041
Okay.
- And killing of Ravan?

2771
02:19:29,125 --> 02:19:30,708
Even that will happen.

2772
02:19:30,791 --> 02:19:32,583
My aim is still right. Yes.

2773
02:19:32,666 --> 02:19:34,166
We are here, relative.
- What?

2774
02:19:34,208 --> 02:19:34,958
Go and check that side.
- Hey!

2775
02:19:35,041 --> 02:19:36,458
Greetings.
- Welcome. Welcome. Greetings.

2776
02:19:36,541 --> 02:19:39,500
Yes. Greetings.. - Hey, everything
that was lacking is complete now.

2777
02:19:39,583 --> 02:19:41,166
Hey, hey, hey.

2778
02:19:41,791 --> 02:19:43,083
Let it be, dear. Let it be.

2779
02:19:43,166 --> 02:19:45,791
Along with the
arrival of the Goddess..

2780
02:19:45,875 --> 02:19:48,958
..even our Goddess has
been welcomed to our house.

2781
02:19:49,291 --> 02:19:50,916
Look here, everyone.

2782
02:19:51,875 --> 02:19:54,625
My Abhi's would be wife.

2783
02:19:55,125 --> 02:19:56,250
My..

2784
02:19:56,333 --> 02:19:57,875
My mother Goddess.

2785
02:19:58,875 --> 02:20:00,625
That is why I will
shout out in happiness.

2786
02:20:00,708 --> 02:20:03,583
Hey drum player. Play the drums.

2787
02:20:19,250 --> 02:20:25,666
"The mother has come."

2788
02:20:26,166 --> 02:20:32,166
"My mother."

2789
02:20:32,541 --> 02:20:40,833
"Everyone's mother. Mother Durga."

2790
02:20:54,375 --> 02:20:56,791
"The rhythm of the drums."

2791
02:20:56,833 --> 02:20:58,541
"The anklets are making a sound."

2792
02:20:58,583 --> 02:21:01,500
"The time for veneration has come."

2793
02:21:01,583 --> 02:21:03,958
"The rhythm of the drums."

2794
02:21:04,041 --> 02:21:05,583
"The anklets are making a sound."

2795
02:21:05,625 --> 02:21:08,500
"The time for veneration has come."

2796
02:21:08,583 --> 02:21:10,875
"Mother's colored feet."

2797
02:21:10,958 --> 02:21:12,666
"And her feet's touch."

2798
02:21:12,750 --> 02:21:15,583
"Has paved way for the pious welcome."

2799
02:21:15,666 --> 02:21:17,916
"Mother's colored feet."

2800
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:19,708
"And her feet's touch."

2801
02:21:19,791 --> 02:21:22,625
"Has paved way for the pious welcome."

2802
02:21:22,708 --> 02:21:25,083
"If you are by our side."

2803
02:21:25,166 --> 02:21:26,875
"Life smiles."

2804
02:21:26,958 --> 02:21:28,541
"There are dreams in both the eyes."

2805
02:21:28,625 --> 02:21:29,791
"In the tune of happiness, mother."

2806
02:21:29,791 --> 02:21:33,125
"You are mother."

2807
02:21:33,333 --> 02:21:36,500
"My mother."

2808
02:21:36,541 --> 02:21:39,833
"Everyone's mother."

2809
02:21:39,916 --> 02:21:42,500
"Mother Durga."

2810
02:21:42,666 --> 02:21:45,666
"Say mother Durga.
- Hail."

2811
02:21:45,750 --> 02:21:49,375
"Say mother Durga.
- Hail."

2812
02:21:49,458 --> 02:21:52,708
"Say mother Durga.
- Hail."

2813
02:22:16,375 --> 02:22:17,833
"In a new style."

2814
02:22:17,916 --> 02:22:19,500
"In a new color."

2815
02:22:19,583 --> 02:22:22,916
"Everyone's hearts
have been decorated."

2816
02:22:23,166 --> 02:22:26,666
"Once the veneration is over,
in happiness and music.."

2817
02:22:26,708 --> 02:22:29,791
"..everyone's life
will be spent happily."

2818
02:22:30,250 --> 02:22:36,041
"My heart's wish is that this love
shouldn't be done away with ever."

2819
02:22:36,458 --> 02:22:40,708
"You are the power
in everyone's heart."

2820
02:22:40,750 --> 02:22:43,708
"You are the idol with ten hands."

2821
02:22:43,791 --> 02:22:47,291
"You are mother."

2822
02:22:47,375 --> 02:22:50,500
"My mother."

2823
02:22:50,583 --> 02:22:53,916
"Everyone's mother."

2824
02:22:54,375 --> 02:22:56,708
"Mother Durga.
- Hail mother Durga."

2825
02:22:56,750 --> 02:22:58,666
"Hail Goddess Durga.
- Hail."

2826
02:22:58,708 --> 02:23:00,208
"Hail mother Durga."

2827
02:23:00,291 --> 02:23:02,416
"Hail Goddess Durga.
- Hail."

2828
02:23:02,500 --> 02:23:03,666
"Hail mother Durga."

2829
02:23:03,750 --> 02:23:06,000
"Hail Goddess Durga.
- Hail."

2830
02:23:06,083 --> 02:23:08,125
"Hail mother Durga."

2831
02:23:24,375 --> 02:23:26,208
"Play the rhythm instruments."

2832
02:23:26,291 --> 02:23:28,375
"Play the drums."

2833
02:23:28,458 --> 02:23:31,416
"Dance happily with the lamps."

2834
02:23:31,500 --> 02:23:33,125
"Hey, dance with the lamp."

2835
02:23:33,250 --> 02:23:35,458
"Decorate the oblation plate."

2836
02:23:35,541 --> 02:23:38,500
"The tenth day is here."

2837
02:23:38,583 --> 02:23:40,291
"Play the rhythm instruments."

2838
02:23:40,375 --> 02:23:42,416
"Play the drums."

2839
02:23:42,500 --> 02:23:45,458
"Dance happily with the lamps."

2840
02:23:45,541 --> 02:23:47,291
"Hey, dance with the lamp."

2841
02:23:47,375 --> 02:23:49,541
"Decorate the oblation plate."

2842
02:23:49,625 --> 02:23:52,500
"The tenth day is here."

2843
02:23:52,583 --> 02:23:55,041
"The rhythm of the drums."

2844
02:23:55,166 --> 02:23:56,625
"The anklets are making a sound."

2845
02:23:56,666 --> 02:23:59,500
"The time for veneration has come."

2846
02:23:59,583 --> 02:24:01,875
"Mother's colored feet."

2847
02:24:01,958 --> 02:24:03,666
"And her feet's touch."

2848
02:24:03,750 --> 02:24:06,666
"Has paved way for the pious welcome."

2849
02:24:06,750 --> 02:24:09,208
"If you are by our side."

2850
02:24:09,291 --> 02:24:10,833
"Life smiles."

2851
02:24:10,916 --> 02:24:12,500
"There are dreams in both the eyes."

2852
02:24:12,583 --> 02:24:13,625
"In the tune of happiness, mother."

2853
02:24:13,666 --> 02:24:17,000
"You are mother."

2854
02:24:17,291 --> 02:24:20,416
"My mother."

2855
02:24:20,583 --> 02:24:23,500
"Everyone's mother."

2856
02:24:23,958 --> 02:24:26,125
"Mother Durga.
- For how long will mother stay?"

2857
02:24:26,208 --> 02:24:28,375
"She will have to be taken
for the final immersion."

2858
02:24:28,416 --> 02:24:31,250
"Mother will go back
to Lord Shiva's house."

2859
02:24:31,333 --> 02:24:33,125
"Everyone's mother.
- Decorate with flowers."

2860
02:24:33,208 --> 02:24:34,583
"Everyone's heart is sad.
Everyone's mother."

2861
02:24:34,625 --> 02:24:39,583
"Mother Durga.
- Mother will come after one year."

2862
02:24:51,500 --> 02:24:54,916
Debraj Rai is alive! Hey, hey, hey!

2863
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,125
How is Debraj Rai
related to Abhiraj Rai?

2864
02:24:57,208 --> 02:25:00,708
What is their relation?
- Abhiraj Rai is Debraj Rai's son.

2865
02:25:00,791 --> 02:25:02,000
What?

2866
02:25:02,708 --> 02:25:04,166
Let me give you
another piece of information.

2867
02:25:04,291 --> 02:25:06,666
Two of your partners
have died at his hands.

2868
02:25:07,416 --> 02:25:08,458
Even you will die.

2869
02:25:08,541 --> 02:25:09,416
Get lost.

2870
02:25:09,500 --> 02:25:11,458
Brother Nayak. Brother Nayak!

2871
02:25:11,541 --> 02:25:13,583
The party is saying that since
it is a lot of money at stake..

2872
02:25:13,666 --> 02:25:16,166
..they will not finalize the
deal without seeing the real party.

2873
02:25:16,291 --> 02:25:18,916
Before that, have a look at this.

2874
02:25:21,666 --> 02:25:23,458
Debraj Rai.

2875
02:25:24,333 --> 02:25:28,166
Debraj Rai and Haridas Pal's
nephew are dancing together.

2876
02:25:28,291 --> 02:25:30,333
He is not Haridas Pal's nephew.

2877
02:25:30,583 --> 02:25:32,416
He is police officer Abhiraj Rai.

2878
02:25:32,500 --> 02:25:34,666
He is Debraj Rai's son.
- Brother.

2879
02:25:35,041 --> 02:25:37,500
I had faxed you his picture.

2880
02:25:37,708 --> 02:25:40,083
You had told me that he
is abroad with his family.

2881
02:25:40,166 --> 02:25:42,791
And yet he was here
and killed two of my men.

2882
02:25:42,875 --> 02:25:44,666
We didn't get his picture, brother.

2883
02:25:44,708 --> 02:25:46,250
We got actor Ranjit Mallik's picture.

2884
02:25:46,333 --> 02:25:49,083
What is this nonsense?
- Cool. Sir. Cool.

2885
02:25:49,458 --> 02:25:51,291
In order to postpone your death..

2886
02:25:51,375 --> 02:25:54,166
..I had changed the picture.
- Hey, fool!

2887
02:25:54,291 --> 02:25:56,500
You are going against your word.

2888
02:25:56,583 --> 02:25:59,541
You had said that you will
kill him first and then me.

2889
02:25:59,625 --> 02:26:01,000
Fool.

2890
02:26:01,458 --> 02:26:05,750
Hey, who got Abhiraj Rai
to you as the land's agent?

2891
02:26:05,833 --> 02:26:06,916
Tell me the truth.
- Yes.

2892
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:08,000
Or I will kill you too.

2893
02:26:08,083 --> 02:26:10,000
I will tell you, I will
tell you. I will tell you.

2894
02:26:13,250 --> 02:26:15,333
Come on, come on.
- Hey, hey!

2895
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:17,791
Hi, Nayak. How are you?

2896
02:26:18,416 --> 02:26:20,708
What is the matter? Why did
you ask these twins to call me?

2897
02:26:20,791 --> 02:26:22,833
What is the matter?
- Where is Haridas Pal's nephew?

2898
02:26:22,916 --> 02:26:24,875
Location.
- Location?

2899
02:26:25,041 --> 02:26:26,791
He has gone to see it.
- What location?

2900
02:26:26,875 --> 02:26:29,500
For shooting. He is a film director.

2901
02:26:29,583 --> 02:26:31,000
Film director?
- Yes.

2902
02:26:31,083 --> 02:26:33,375
Film director?
- Brother Keshto.

2903
02:26:33,541 --> 02:26:35,958
All your life you have
just cheated and earned money.

2904
02:26:36,041 --> 02:26:39,125
You didn't care to find out
anything about culture and all.

2905
02:26:39,250 --> 02:26:41,666
Singapore's Haridas Pal's nephew..
- Yes?

2906
02:26:41,708 --> 02:26:43,333
He is making a movie.

2907
02:26:44,625 --> 02:26:46,666
I am the hero.
- You are the hero?

2908
02:26:48,291 --> 02:26:50,083
Should I burst another bomb?

2909
02:26:50,750 --> 02:26:53,041
The actress of the
movie is Koel Mallik.

2910
02:26:53,125 --> 02:26:54,666
Who?
- Who?

2911
02:26:54,708 --> 02:26:57,375
Haridas Pal has liked
our pair so much that..

2912
02:26:57,458 --> 02:26:59,958
..he has bought the
overseas rights of the film.

2913
02:27:00,041 --> 02:27:01,083
Really?
- Yes.

2914
02:27:01,208 --> 02:27:02,375
Where is the scoundrel?

2915
02:27:02,458 --> 02:27:04,000
What is the matter? This is strange!

2916
02:27:04,083 --> 02:27:05,291
Let me go.
- 'Golden lotus."

2917
02:27:05,375 --> 02:27:07,250
Hey, let go of me. Hey, don't push.
- Hey, is he the one?

2918
02:27:07,291 --> 02:27:08,375
Who are you?

2919
02:27:08,458 --> 02:27:10,166
Okay.

2920
02:27:10,791 --> 02:27:13,208
So you are doing the role
of mafia don Guru Nayak?

2921
02:27:13,291 --> 02:27:15,083
Hey.
- Hey.

2922
02:27:15,375 --> 02:27:16,583
Don't show me reaction like that.

2923
02:27:16,625 --> 02:27:18,875
I know a lot of reactions like that.

2924
02:27:18,958 --> 02:27:20,708
I asked you to meet me.
Why didn't you meet me?

2925
02:27:20,750 --> 02:27:21,958
Don't you have money?
- Hey!

2926
02:27:22,041 --> 02:27:23,541
Hey, I will get hurt.

2927
02:27:23,791 --> 02:27:26,250
"Golden lotus."
- Why is he hitting me?

2928
02:27:26,500 --> 02:27:30,916
I see. I think Mithoon wants t see
my reaction after being slapped.

2929
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:32,500
Okay, big boss.

2930
02:27:32,666 --> 02:27:33,583
Hey..
- Hey!

2931
02:27:33,625 --> 02:27:35,833
You are showing off your
hooliganism to me? - Yes.

2932
02:27:35,916 --> 02:27:40,041
I have given birth to many
dons like you in Singapore.

2933
02:27:40,166 --> 02:27:43,541
They still hear my name and
urinate in their pants. - What?

2934
02:27:43,625 --> 02:27:45,000
Fool. Watch me.

2935
02:27:45,083 --> 02:27:46,416
Hey..
- Hey!

2936
02:27:46,500 --> 02:27:47,541
Take this.
- Hey!

2937
02:27:47,625 --> 02:27:48,583
Give it.
- Hey!

2938
02:27:48,583 --> 02:27:49,416
Another one..
- Hey!

2939
02:27:49,541 --> 02:27:50,416
Attack..
- Hey!

2940
02:27:50,500 --> 02:27:51,791
Hey, are you a human being or animal?

2941
02:27:51,875 --> 02:27:53,416
Is that the way to hit your co-actor?

2942
02:27:53,500 --> 02:27:55,958
Co-actor? - Who will take
the responsibility if I die?

2943
02:27:56,625 --> 02:27:58,916
You are thinking of a real man, right?

2944
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:00,625
This is a reality show.

2945
02:28:00,708 --> 02:28:02,375
You are playing a character of a don.

2946
02:28:02,458 --> 02:28:04,583
Remember that..
- I am playing the character of a don?

2947
02:28:04,666 --> 02:28:06,041
You..
- Stop it.

2948
02:28:06,166 --> 02:28:07,541
Stop..
- Oh no, oh no..

2949
02:28:07,583 --> 02:28:11,208
Do you think I am mad?
Wait. I will make arrangements.

2950
02:28:11,583 --> 02:28:13,375
Look, teacher.
- What?

2951
02:28:13,458 --> 02:28:15,583
Since you like my performance..

2952
02:28:15,666 --> 02:28:18,583
..I have given various
reactions even after being hit.

2953
02:28:18,708 --> 02:28:21,250
But this mad man
will kill me in reality.

2954
02:28:21,333 --> 02:28:22,583
Hey, who are you talking to?

2955
02:28:22,625 --> 02:28:23,916
Who am I talking to?
- Yes.

2956
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:25,333
Don't you know bog boss?
- Who?

2957
02:28:25,416 --> 02:28:27,000
The one who has given this concept?

2958
02:28:27,125 --> 02:28:27,916
Don't you know him?
- He is..

2959
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:29,166
Now tell me that you don't know..

2960
02:28:29,250 --> 02:28:30,541
..the great teacher
Mithoon Chakraborty too.

2961
02:28:30,625 --> 02:28:30,708
Hey, what is he saying..

2962
02:28:30,791 --> 02:28:31,875
Look, great teacher.

2963
02:28:31,958 --> 02:28:33,458
He says that he doesn't know you too.

2964
02:28:33,541 --> 02:28:35,541
He will sink the whole reality show.

2965
02:28:35,583 --> 02:28:36,583
What?
- Do away with him.

2966
02:28:36,666 --> 02:28:38,166
Or else, all your
money will be wasted.

2967
02:28:38,250 --> 02:28:39,166
Just explain it to him.

2968
02:28:39,250 --> 02:28:40,708
Mithoon Chakraborty in the pen?

2969
02:28:40,791 --> 02:28:43,458
Hey fool, this pen has a camera.

2970
02:28:43,541 --> 02:28:46,166
Mithoon is in the studio and is
watching everything from there.

2971
02:28:46,250 --> 02:28:47,875
This is..
- Stop! Just stop!

2972
02:28:47,958 --> 02:28:49,833
Is this a mad house?

2973
02:28:49,875 --> 02:28:51,208
He says..
- Oh no, be careful.

2974
02:28:51,291 --> 02:28:52,750
He says that he is a film hero.

2975
02:28:52,833 --> 02:28:54,666
And he is saying that
this is a reality show.

2976
02:28:54,750 --> 02:28:56,875
I am doing the don's character.

2977
02:28:56,958 --> 02:28:58,125
What is the matter?

2978
02:28:58,208 --> 02:29:01,000
Hey, brother, explain it to him..
- Cool, sir. Cool.

2979
02:29:01,708 --> 02:29:03,875
Didn't you understand this much?

2980
02:29:03,958 --> 02:29:07,833
He has caught hold of
these fools to get you.

2981
02:29:07,916 --> 02:29:10,250
The cunning boy..

2982
02:29:10,750 --> 02:29:13,750
He pulls out the snakes
from the holes and kills them.

2983
02:29:13,833 --> 02:29:16,916
And you have come out the
hole and inviting him to..

2984
02:29:17,041 --> 02:29:19,541
..come and thrash you.

2985
02:29:20,125 --> 02:29:22,458
Will he play the
clarinet for you to dance on?

2986
02:29:22,666 --> 02:29:26,208
Listen carefully. Now I
hear the sound of his arrival.

2987
02:29:37,958 --> 02:29:41,458
If I am right, you will be able
to hear the voice on the mike.

2988
02:29:41,666 --> 02:29:44,208
Nayak. Surrender.

2989
02:29:44,375 --> 02:29:46,541
Nayak, I am asking you to.
- Hey..

2990
02:29:46,625 --> 02:29:48,500
Cool, sir, cool.

2991
02:29:49,166 --> 02:29:52,250
Why are you rushing
when you have to die?

2992
02:29:52,333 --> 02:29:53,458
Stand here silently.

2993
02:29:53,541 --> 02:29:55,041
He will come here. Shoot
you and leave from here.

2994
02:29:55,125 --> 02:29:56,375
Hey..
- Oh no.

2995
02:29:56,458 --> 02:29:57,500
Hey, come on.

2996
02:29:58,333 --> 02:30:01,541
"Golden Lotus."
- Thank you, great teacher.

2997
02:30:01,625 --> 02:30:03,083
That man was amazed.
- Yes.

2998
02:30:03,166 --> 02:30:04,875
Hey, all the rest are
doing over acting. - Yes.

2999
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,125
Hey, why are you going that side?

3000
02:30:07,208 --> 02:30:09,541
If one bullet hits you,
you will be dead.

3001
02:30:09,625 --> 02:30:11,333
Hey, which fool is this?

3002
02:30:11,416 --> 02:30:13,000
Hey, this is a reality show.

3003
02:30:13,083 --> 02:30:15,041
All of them are false
bullets and false cops.

3004
02:30:15,125 --> 02:30:19,000
Hey fool, this is real
police and real don.

3005
02:30:19,083 --> 02:30:20,666
"Golden lotus."
- Real bullets. - What?

3006
02:30:20,875 --> 02:30:21,916
And this?

3007
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:23,708
Oh no, no, no, let us run.
Let us run.

3008
02:30:38,625 --> 02:30:41,750
Nayak. It is a last call.

3009
02:30:42,208 --> 02:30:44,375
Nayak. Surrender yourself.

3010
02:30:44,416 --> 02:30:48,416
No one must move.
All of you, lower your guns.

3011
02:30:48,833 --> 02:30:50,250
Lower your guns.
- Down.

3012
02:30:50,333 --> 02:30:51,500
Lower them.

3013
02:30:51,583 --> 02:30:53,000
Or else, I will kill him.

3014
02:30:53,666 --> 02:30:54,833
Move.

3015
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:35,291
Okay.

3016
02:31:35,500 --> 02:31:39,375
I agreed with him due
to my greed of 4 crores.

3017
02:31:39,958 --> 02:31:43,416
But how could you think that
you could be hero of the movie?

3018
02:31:43,500 --> 02:31:46,500
Does one become a hero
with cheeks like that?

3019
02:31:46,583 --> 02:31:51,833
He had said that he will make me a
little puffy with computer graphics.

3020
02:32:02,208 --> 02:32:04,083
I.. I am uncle.

3021
02:32:04,166 --> 02:32:08,083
I taught you
swimming in the childhood.

3022
02:32:11,583 --> 02:32:15,083
I wasn't a part of the
gang that killed your father.

3023
02:32:15,166 --> 02:32:16,500
If I wouldn't have joined their gang..

3024
02:32:16,583 --> 02:32:19,416
..Nayak had told me he
would kill me at that time.

3025
02:32:19,500 --> 02:32:24,125
Don't spare them. Gun them.
Don't spare them.

3026
02:32:41,541 --> 02:32:43,083
Thank you, inspector Dhar.

3027
02:32:43,250 --> 02:32:45,458
The mission wouldn't have
been complete without you.

3028
02:32:45,541 --> 02:32:48,375
We are proud of you.
- Thank you, sir.

3029
02:32:48,458 --> 02:32:50,083
It is my duty.
- Good.

3030
02:32:50,166 --> 02:32:51,583
Now go that side.

3031
02:32:52,041 --> 02:32:53,250
Okay, sir.

3032
02:33:55,125 --> 02:33:56,458
Imtiyas.

3033
02:33:56,666 --> 02:33:57,916
Imtiyas.

3034
02:33:58,291 --> 02:33:59,583
Alif!

3035
02:34:03,583 --> 02:34:09,666
The ones I lay my eyes
on has to die for sure.

3036
02:34:09,791 --> 02:34:10,958
Hey!

3037
02:35:19,458 --> 02:35:21,291
Give me a chance once.

3038
02:35:21,958 --> 02:35:27,541
Hey fool. Do you think I am a
film director to give you a chance?

3039
02:35:27,666 --> 02:35:30,375
Give me a chance. Once. Once.

3040
02:35:30,458 --> 02:35:37,125
Hey, the one who becomes my
target once doesn't return home.

3041
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
He goes to the house of death.

3042
02:36:25,708 --> 02:36:27,541
It is your end today.
- What?

3043
02:36:27,666 --> 02:36:29,500
Brother, he is talking about Raavan.

3044
02:36:29,625 --> 02:36:31,291
"The destroyer of evil."

3045
02:36:31,375 --> 02:36:33,250
"The destroyer of evil."

3046
02:36:33,333 --> 02:36:36,916
"Lord's name is true."

3047
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:38,791
"The destroyer of evil."

3048
02:36:38,875 --> 02:36:40,541
"The destroyer of evil."

3049
02:36:40,666 --> 02:36:44,375
"Lord's name is true."

3050
02:37:18,791 --> 02:37:20,125
Abhi.

3051
02:37:23,166 --> 02:37:28,166
Father. I have mailed the
veneration pictures to uncle.

3052
02:37:28,833 --> 02:37:32,250
On seeing you dance in the picture,
uncle was very happy.

3053
02:37:49,250 --> 02:37:50,708
Why did you do it?

3054
02:37:51,875 --> 02:37:55,708
A world. One that
doesn't have an existence.

3055
02:37:57,083 --> 02:37:59,875
Why did you create a
false world like that?

3056
02:38:00,666 --> 02:38:02,416
For making me forget everything.

3057
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:07,083
So that father is fine and happy?

3058
02:38:07,500 --> 02:38:11,083
In order to say one lie,
you have got so many lies in.

3059
02:38:12,125 --> 02:38:16,625
But even in all these lies,
there is one truth.

3060
02:38:17,500 --> 02:38:21,708
I am fine. And I am very happy.

3061
02:38:24,541 --> 02:38:29,250
When you needed me the most,
I wasn't with you.

3062
02:38:30,750 --> 02:38:33,000
I couldn't do anything as a father.

3063
02:38:34,708 --> 02:38:38,500
Then why are you doing
so much for me? Tell me.

3064
02:38:38,916 --> 02:38:41,958
Who has given this life to me?

3065
02:38:42,041 --> 02:38:45,166
Every father wants
love from their sons.

3066
02:38:45,916 --> 02:38:48,916
And my son has given
me so much of love.

3067
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:52,250
It wouldn't be enough even
if I was born 100 times.

3068
02:38:53,166 --> 02:38:56,708
I have got a lot. I have got a lot.

3069
02:38:56,791 --> 02:38:58,541
Brother.
- Father.. - Brother.

3070
02:38:58,625 --> 02:39:00,041
Father.
- What?

3071
02:39:02,250 --> 02:39:04,125
Why are you getting scared?

3072
02:39:04,208 --> 02:39:09,666
Even God doesn't have the
strength to take my son away from me.

3073
02:39:10,416 --> 02:39:14,750
All sons have their father's
love on them as umbrellas.

3074
02:39:14,791 --> 02:39:21,541
And I am the first father who
has his son's love on his head.

3075
02:39:22,041 --> 02:39:23,541
Yes?
