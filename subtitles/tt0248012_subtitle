1
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,102
Aman, my brother

2
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,903
Aman, so simple, so loving

3
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:23,969
He always had a smile on his face

4
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:27,234
Aman was a very hardworking

5
00:01:29,133 --> 00:01:31,468
He would go on and on,
till he was satisfied...

6
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:36,370
sketching, bringing out the lines

7
00:01:46,866 --> 00:01:48,667
He was a bit naughty too

8
00:01:49,366 --> 00:01:54,704
He would make ugly faces
to make me laugh

9
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,902
We were so happy, really

10
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:10,437
Aman, Ammi and l...
we were so happy

11
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,704
Your Abba, Allah rest his soul,
used to say that...

12
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:26,602
daughters are born into homes
that are blessed by Allah

13
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:31,370
Meaning that sons are born into homes
that aren't blessed by Allah?

14
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:36,804
Mad girl! Daughters serve.
That's why he used to say it

15
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:40,136
As of now, you're serving the daughter.
- Why are you jealous?

16
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,135
Let me pick that nonsense
out of your brains

17
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,936
What do you mean nonsense? Ammi, you
better tell Apa. Else, l'll get angry

18
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,036
Angry!
- Don't you rile my baby

19
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:52,367
Let him watch the picture

20
00:02:56,333 --> 00:03:00,103
l've seen this picture ten times over.
l'm waiting for the news

21
00:03:00,366 --> 00:03:04,002
D'you know what's happening in town?
- What's there in the news?

22
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:10,603
They start fights for
out-of-work hooligans

23
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,206
Those leaders instigate simple men
to commit murder. Damn them

24
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:20,868
Here they might get away with
whatever they feel like doing

25
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:24,602
But in kingdom come, just you see
how they will be punished

26
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,470
Look! l didn't even realize
it's so late in the night

27
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:34,102
Go on, you two. Go to bed.
- Ammi...

28
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,601
See the news tomorrow.
- Ammi! One minute!

29
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:39,001
TY shut

30
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:42,868
What's this Ammi?
- It's very late

31
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:52,237
What's this ''good-night''?
Can't you say ''Shabba Khair''?

32
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,201
Shabba Khair, Ammi

33
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:57,767
Come on, go to sleep

34
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:19,403
Don't tire your eyes.
Go to sleep

35
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,104
May Allah keep my family
from harm's way

36
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:29,367
That dog is crying again

37
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,668
Yery bad sign

38
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:33,467
Mercy, Allah

39
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:19,668
What's up, Firoz?
- Aman, they are killing our people

40
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:23,069
Even burnt down Uncle Sadiq's shop.
- What can we do?

41
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:26,870
Let's go and take a look.
- No. We'll get caught in the riots

42
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:28,400
We won't. Come on

43
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:32,000
Stop thinking. Come on!
- Come

44
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:45,968
They've gone mad! They're going to
kill each other

45
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:50,703
Lord curse the makers of
guns and bullets

46
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:52,400
Get away from the window!

47
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,201
Go to Aman!

48
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:01,736
Ammi! Aman isn't there!
- Where's Aman?

49
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,468
Run Aman! Run!

50
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,868
Salaam, Mrs. Bhige.
Everything all right

51
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:52,501
Yes, Nishat Bi. Sit

52
00:09:53,733 --> 00:10:02,141
Your son hurt his hand. How is he?
- Kids. No matter what, do they care?

53
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:10,039
Pain, one feels with age. One blow,
and the pain stays till the very end

54
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:11,734
Will you drink tea?

55
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,635
Don't you drink tea either.
Here, gram pudding

56
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,269
Cooked with pure milk fat.
l wouldn't know, though

57
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,638
He sold it to me saying it's pure.
- You look happy. What's up?

58
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,268
Fiza has passed!
- B.A. pass? (Graduation)

59
00:10:28,466 --> 00:10:34,972
Good! What does she want to do next?
- l don't know. Says she'll do a job

60
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:39,303
Poor girl, what else can she do?
She has to run the household

61
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,368
Her Abba's pension isn't
bountiful enough...

62
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:46,369
to provide for a comfortable living
in these times

63
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,905
The same old rented house.
The same old way of living

64
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:56,469
Allah is my Master. The One
who helped us all along...

65
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:58,201
will surely help us live the rest
with dignity

66
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:04,004
Now Nishat Bi, let's talk of what
you've been coming here for...

67
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:05,800
once every week, these six years

68
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:12,071
No news of your son. So many times
on TY he has been announced ''Missing''

69
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:19,406
So much questioning. Result, zero.
l don't think there will be any news

70
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:24,870
There's no news of 1 60 people.
Hindus, also Mussalmans

71
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:28,502
You aren't the only one.
There are so many who are crying

72
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:34,905
Why should l cry? Let my enemies cry.
l'm sure he's alive. And he'll be back

73
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:38,969
Someday, he will surely come.
Salaam aleikum

74
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,034
lt's so hot today

75
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,934
Who is it?
- No one

76
00:11:59,566 --> 00:12:01,868
Who was it?
- l told you. No one

77
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,668
Why were you so tense in the car?

78
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,770
lt's nothing at all.
- That someone on the way

79
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:21,734
You saw. And you reacted

80
00:12:23,933 --> 00:12:28,037
lt was Ammi.
- You should've stopped the car

81
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,567
She wouldn't have liked it

82
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:35,570
The place she was coming back from
... she goes there on the sly

83
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:39,669
On the sly? Where?

84
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,034
l understand

85
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:52,803
Someday, everything will be all right.

86
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:59,337
Who knows when that day will come?
Come on, hurry

87
00:13:07,766 --> 00:13:10,969
l still don't believe l passed!

88
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:13,801
l only read your notes

89
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:21,038
But with you, they were unjust.
You should've scored at least 7O_

90
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:25,669
659b is more than enough.
l couldn't really study hard

91
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,603
Can't study at home. Had to make do
with what l could at the library

92
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,571
You could hardly study in the library.
There he was sitting right across

93
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:40,236
Anirudh.
- Gitanjali, l don't fancy idle talk

94
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:43,368
lf you keep raving like this,
some day, l'm going to strangle you

95
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:47,002
Go on, strangle me.
But my dying words will be...

96
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:51,203
Anirudh Roy and Fiza Ikramullah

97
00:14:18,266 --> 00:14:26,073
''The Lord grants the believers''

98
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:35,241
''Here we will be given''

00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,235
''Seek here with your heart''

100
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:43,370
''Seek from Haji Ali''

101
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,472
''The Believer''

102
00:15:04,366 --> 00:15:06,835
''The King of the Seas''

103
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,706
''Homage to the King of the Seas''

104
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,505

00:15:46,066 --> 00:15:49,436

107
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:58,269
''At your door''

108
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,905
''Stand the believers, the seekers''

110
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:46,339
''Hindu, Muslim, Sikh., Christian
are given'

111
00:16:46,933 --> 00:16:53,406
''The seas stand guard''

112
00:16:59,866 --> 00:17:01,133
Shehnaz!

113
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:02,934
Aunt, you?

114
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:06,802
You've become as rare as
the Moon on Idd! Forgotten us?

115
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:08,234
Not at all

116
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:10,867
So much work at home...

117
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:13,601
l'll come. Surely

118
00:17:20,866 --> 00:17:30,041
''Bestow upon us the benediction
of Mohammad''

119
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:39,241
''Bestow upon us the benediction
of Mohammad''

''Whoever has submitted to you
The Lord will care for''

131
00:19:39,933 --> 00:19:40,800
Where have you been for so long?

132
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:46,570
Go in and have the Fatiya recited
And give the cookies to the kids

133
00:19:49,033 --> 00:19:50,234
What are you doing, Ammi?

134
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:51,834
Charity

135
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:00,334
Stop it now, Ammi

136
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:04,235
Now l haven't said a word, have l?

137
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:08,435
Why did you have to splurge money
like a queen?

138
00:20:08,866 --> 00:20:11,668
You were handing out tens
as if you've won a lottery

139
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:17,137
So that's why you're grumpy.
Darling, if l had my way...

140
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,337
l would've palmed out in hundreds.
Your Abba, Allah rest his soul...

141
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:25,970
l don't want to hear what Abba said.
He died, and he left us here to die!

142
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:29,302
Sacrilege Fiza! Must you speak ill
of the dead?

143
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:34,504
Why shouldn't l? In this house,
who's alive? You? l...?

144
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:36,801
The only question is about...
- Enough!

145
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,535
You start running your tongue
like scissors!

146
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:43,203
Get a hold on yourself!
Someday, you'll go to another house

147
00:20:43,466 --> 00:20:48,504
This attitude won't do.
- First, you get a hold on yourself

148
00:20:48,966 --> 00:20:52,169
lt's been six years. You've turned
this house into a waiting room

149
00:20:52,566 --> 00:20:55,835
Eyes, staring out of windows;
ears, glued to the door...

150
00:20:56,233 --> 00:21:00,704
one knock, and you jump.
Day and night, twenty four hours

151
00:21:01,633 --> 00:21:04,035
lt's just the same thing. Do you
know how much you've changed?

152
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:08,403
You even turn away from me
to hide your red eyes

153
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:13,570
Why did you fall silent?
Take it out

154
00:21:14,433 --> 00:21:20,238
l won't say a thing. Because
l'm your mother. l bore you

155
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,701
l don't understand!
How long will this go on?

156
00:21:26,266 --> 00:21:30,603
How long are we to live like this?
- Not me. Ask that of your fate

157
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:36,705
Fate, fate, fate! Nice word.
But hollow. What will you eat?

158
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:40,136
Shall l cook turnips?
- Yes! He used to love it!

159
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,668
He used to hog it by the potfuls!

160
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,968
One man sent these flowers

161
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,768
Who was it?
- Didn't tell me his name

162
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:05,668
Came in a big car.
- Big car?

163
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:08,068
Yes, he called me and told me
to give it to you

164
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,301
All right, go

165
00:22:11,933 --> 00:22:16,037
Who's this Romeo sending flowers
to my daughter on the sly?

166
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:19,568
But he's a miser.
- Orchids. Yery expensive

167
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:26,338
Why throw it away? You should keep
flowers in their vases

168
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:28,234
The flowers will bless you

169
00:22:29,233 --> 00:22:33,804
Flowers! Your Abba used to bring
baskets full of jasmine!

170
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,935
And l'd distribute them
to all the neighbors

171
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:39,900
And now...?

172
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:44,536
There's no one left to lay
a few flowers on his grave

173
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:52,403
Flower girl! You look great!
How about some flowers this way?

174
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:56,302
Raspberry!
- Let me have the flowers

175
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:58,134
Come down!

176
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:03,334
She ran!

177
00:23:06,033 --> 00:23:07,434
One more!

178
00:23:38,866 --> 00:23:41,301
Where are you rushing off with
the flowers, like an express train?

179
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,901
Don't call me. It's ominous.
l have something important to do

180
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:48,470
No harm done. A mother's curses
turn into blessings

181
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,535
How about a quick bite?
- No time!

182
00:23:51,766 --> 00:23:54,268
One minute.
- l know your one-minutes too well

183
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,935
Anyway, get back early.
Before sundown

184
00:23:58,433 --> 00:24:02,503
l keep worrying.
- Your curfew is my command

185
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:04,000
Any more commands?

186
00:24:05,766 --> 00:24:07,367
lt's just to ward off the evil eye

187
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,435
For God's sake, don't talk English

188
00:24:13,933 --> 00:24:18,537
Go with a smile.
Come back with a smile

189
00:24:29,566 --> 00:24:36,940
By Allah! What a beauty!

190
00:24:37,433 --> 00:24:40,102
Fiza has become so pretty!
The bounty of youth is spilling over!

191
00:24:41,266 --> 00:24:44,302
Shut your mouth, you fool! Must you
say whatever comes to your mind...

192
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:46,301
you mad girl?
- Mad? l...?

193
00:24:48,633 --> 00:24:54,305
The whole world was mad about
my voice, my style!

194
00:24:54,633 --> 00:24:58,003
All a matter of time, Nishat Bi.
Gone are the connoisseurs...

195
00:24:58,266 --> 00:25:01,002
gone are the times. l'm still
the beauty l was...

196
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:05,103
my voice is still as wonderful!
- And still as mad!

197
00:25:18,466 --> 00:25:20,968
Stop keeping up all night
for that girl

198
00:25:21,233 --> 00:25:24,235
Else, you'll keep losing like this.
- How about another game?

199
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,901
Shoot it!

200
00:25:28,733 --> 00:25:31,502
You come all the way here,
to see me!

201
00:25:32,733 --> 00:25:36,303
What's that file about?
- l'm going for an interview

202
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:38,735
lnterview? For some small-time job?

203
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:43,370
Come over to Dad's office tomorrow.
l'll fix a job for you

204
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,535
l don't want a job
on recommendations

205
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,668
Such vanity?

206
00:25:55,966 --> 00:25:56,866
Listen...

207
00:26:11,266 --> 00:26:14,502
First try at a job?
- How did you know?

208
00:26:14,933 --> 00:26:19,570
Job-hunters don't look at watches.
l'm an old-timer in this jungle

209
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,269
Relax. Your number won't come up
before four or five hours

210
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:26,035
But in the papers, it was an
On the spot interview

211
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:32,172
On-the-spot means they won't spend
two Rupees per postcard to call us

212
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:33,600
lt's just a drama

213
00:26:35,433 --> 00:26:37,468
Don't get nervous.
You'll get used to it

214
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:43,138
You'll stop marking time. You'll even
forget asking for months and dates

215
00:26:44,766 --> 00:26:45,967
Want a drink of water?

216
00:26:49,866 --> 00:26:53,436
Bisleri. Municipality water.
Boiled it at home

217
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:55,067
Drink it up

218
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:13,135
What did l tell you?

219
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:35,336
Listen, isn't there any other way
out of here?

220
00:27:35,566 --> 00:27:40,237
Lots. But l can't leave my auto
and walk. Mumbai traffic

221
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,401
Relax. Listen to a song

222
00:28:22,366 --> 00:28:26,570
Hey girl! Can't see? Gone mad?
Go somewhere else if you want to die!

223
00:28:41,633 --> 00:28:43,434
Go on. That's all for today

224
00:28:45,966 --> 00:28:51,604
Why are you so late? l'm afraid...
if you too leave me...

225
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:56,137
l'm not going anywhere.
Where can l go? Have l any way out?

226
00:28:56,766 --> 00:28:59,368
Why are you getting worked up?
l didn't tell you anything

227
00:28:59,733 --> 00:29:04,804
l thought l saw him in an auto.
l ran, but there was so much traffic...

228
00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:09,871
l couldn't do anything! Come on Ammi,
give me my jewelry

229
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:12,335
Why?
- l want to pawn it

230
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:18,905
What for? Thanks be to Allah,
we're eating well enough

231
00:29:19,533 --> 00:29:23,370
l need the money. l want to put an end
to the suspense

232
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:26,969
lt doesn't let us die.
It won't let us live

233
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,937
l want to look for Aman.
For that, l need money

234
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:35,669
How much will a pair of anklets
and earrings fetch?

235
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,901
l'm not selling. l want to pawn it

236
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:41,634
l won't give!

237
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,603
Because you don't have the guts
to find out the truth?

238
00:29:47,033 --> 00:29:49,268
You don't even want to know what
happened that night...

239
00:29:49,566 --> 00:29:52,568
what happened to your son!
- Yes! l don't want to know!

240
00:29:53,766 --> 00:29:58,871
Old as l am, l have no hopes left,
but for one full-blooded son!

241
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:02,803
l don't have the son.
But the hope, l still have

242
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:06,335
You want to take it away from me?

243
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,203
l have nothing else!

244
00:30:19,366 --> 00:30:25,305
Hiding the ailment won't heal
the wound. It festers

245
00:30:27,266 --> 00:30:34,072
l have decided. We aren't going
to live in agony

246
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:39,236
l'm not going to let the wait
kill you, kill me

247
00:30:40,933 --> 00:30:42,934
Trust me, Ammi

248
00:30:43,866 --> 00:30:45,267
l'm saying the right thing

249
00:30:58,066 --> 00:31:03,070
l need 25,OOO. Please let me have it.
Don't you trust me?

250
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:06,369
We had it made from your shop.
- What a thing to say, sister

251
00:31:06,633 --> 00:31:08,935
lf l didn't trust you, wouldn't
l have deducted interest in advance?

252
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,335
Say, do you agree to 1$,OOO?

253
00:31:13,233 --> 00:31:14,667
All right. Let me have it.

254
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:20,737
May l make a call?
- Why not. 3 Rupees for a local call

255
00:31:26,633 --> 00:31:27,934
Here you are. 1 $,OOO

256
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:38,035
The entire amount?
- Yes. All of 4,OOO

257
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:52,034
Why are you staring like that?

258
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:58,604
Were l not on duty, l would've
downed seven, eight glasses

259
00:31:59,433 --> 00:32:01,635
You were supposed to tell me
what happened that night

260
00:32:12,866 --> 00:32:16,603
This is the copy of my deposition
in the court

261
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:19,802
Everything that happened, all l saw
is written in there

262
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:23,769
l have heard your deposition.
l was in the court on that day

263
00:32:24,566 --> 00:32:28,803
Then, what more do you want to hear?
- That which isn't in that affidavit

264
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:33,603
The truth.
- No melodramas

265
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:37,636
Did l tell lies in the court?
- If you cannot tell me...

266
00:32:38,033 --> 00:32:39,901
give me back my 4,OOO

267
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:48,171
What you want to hear,
l can tell you

268
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,336
But you're from a decent family.
So let me tell you something

269
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:55,502
Forget whatever happened

270
00:32:58,133 --> 00:32:59,234
Listen...

271
00:33:00,566 --> 00:33:05,337
peel off the scab that covers
the wound, and it hurts more

272
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:10,870
There are so many people in trouble.
They killed old Sawant's son

273
00:33:11,133 --> 00:33:15,270
Sawant is begging. Forget all that.
Eat popcorn

274
00:33:16,266 --> 00:33:17,834
Tell me what happened that night

275
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:32,600
He was running

276
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:40,572
Sahib! Help me sahib!
They are after me!

277
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:42,967
They're going to kill me!
They killed my friend!

278
00:33:43,233 --> 00:33:45,969
We haven't done anything!
- You want to live?

279
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,368
Run! Run away to Pakistan!

280
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,837
Burnt my husband alive with
a tire around his neck!

281
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:57,002
Do something! For Allah's sake!
Do something!

282
00:34:00,266 --> 00:34:03,669
What are you staring at?
Get lost. Move it

283
00:34:04,733 --> 00:34:05,834
Go away

284
00:34:06,533 --> 00:34:07,901
What can we do?

285
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:10,335
Back out

286
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,602
We're ruined!

287
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:11,769
You left a half-dead boy
Iying on the streets?

288
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:20,736
lt wasn't time for sentiments.
Had l tried to save that one...

289
00:35:20,966 --> 00:35:22,934
l would've had four more corpses
on my hand

290
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,336
Any idea where my brother
could've gone?

291
00:35:30,866 --> 00:35:32,367
What can l say?

292
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:38,003
Even if anyone saw him,
who remembers?

293
00:35:39,133 --> 00:35:40,767
You remember nothing at all...?

294
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:44,802
Maybe... somewhere... something?

295
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,604
lt's so old a matter
... what can l say?

296
00:36:07,233 --> 00:36:10,536
Among them... among the corpses...?

297
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,734
Was my brother there?

298
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,968
Might be

299
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,768
Might not be...?

300
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,101
Might not be

301
00:36:26,533 --> 00:36:30,904
Do you sleep peacefully at nights?
- What did you say?

302
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,135
l don't know whom to curse

303
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,102
What... what did you say?
Curse...?

304
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:41,469
Take that. For your beer

305
00:37:00,133 --> 00:37:01,534
Burnt

306
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:04,268
ls this what l've lived to hear?

307
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:12,904
Possibly he wasn't in that
pile of corpses...?

308
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:21,005
Even after hearing everything,
l still don't believe it

309
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:27,072
lf l knew it in my heart, maybe
my eyes wouldn't be dry. He can't die

310
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:34,838
Tell me what you're going to do.
- l don't know what l'll do

311
00:37:36,133 --> 00:37:38,235
l just have a hazy idea in my mind

312
00:37:40,033 --> 00:37:43,803
Don't get into anything dangerous.
Promise me

313
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:50,504
Don't make me promise anything, Ammi.
Trust me

314
00:38:08,566 --> 00:38:11,168
Have anything? Give me

315
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:19,700
May you be happy

316
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:21,801
Your name is Sawant, isn't it?

317
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:23,934
Who are you?

318
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:25,668
Fiza Ikramullah

319
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:33,103
l don't want your money!
Take it away! l don't want it!

320
00:38:35,066 --> 00:38:42,139
lnspector Prakash Ingle told me about
you. Your story is the same as mine

321
00:38:43,033 --> 00:38:49,639
My story? What did he say my story is?
What story did that bastard tell you?

322
00:38:50,233 --> 00:38:54,971
Your son...
- Yes. Killed my son!

323
00:38:55,666 --> 00:39:00,170
Killed my son! And the bastards
want evidence!

324
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,203
Said, get the evidence that
your son is dead!

325
00:39:04,766 --> 00:39:06,767
This government wants evidence!

326
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:15,137
Mussalman, aren't you?
Your people kill my son?

327
00:39:15,566 --> 00:39:21,071
Why did your people kill my Chandu?
What had he done to harm you?

328
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,471
This isn't a matter of yours and mine.
For all of us, it's the same story

329
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:33,437
A Hindu father has lost his son.
A Mussalman sister lost her brother

330
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:40,004
But the ones responsible for this
is neither Hindu nor Mussalman

331
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:45,271
What their religion is,
no one knows

332
00:39:46,566 --> 00:39:52,605
Still, why did they kill my Chandu?
He was a laborer

333
00:39:53,133 --> 00:39:55,702
He was to have come home after work
... from the factory

334
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:06,805
Must've taken him... in the trucks

335
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:15,439
l don't even know if he got his
Iast rites. Who lit his pyre?

336
00:40:16,966 --> 00:40:19,835
Might've put him on a pyre
for the unidentifieds

337
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:28,804
They want the evidence because
they'll give compensation. 200,OOO

338
00:40:30,033 --> 00:40:33,269
Price of a live young man. 200,OOO!

339
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:38,637
My son's price! Chandu's price!
200,OOO pieces of paper!

340
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,168
l don't want their money!

341
00:40:46,033 --> 00:40:51,071
What will l do with the money?
If l beg, everyone will give me

342
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:55,469
When l'm dead, the municipality will
cremate me for free. Unidentified!

343
00:40:55,733 --> 00:40:57,234
The way they cremated my Chandu!

344
00:41:01,466 --> 00:41:03,100
l don't want it!

345
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:10,202
Can l do anything for you?

346
00:41:11,866 --> 00:41:16,570
Yes! Can you get me proof
of my Chandu's death?

347
00:41:31,066 --> 00:41:33,668
No one wants to hear Sawant

348
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:40,503
lt's as if humane feelings
have gone missing

349
00:41:40,766 --> 00:41:42,033
Like Aman

350
00:41:51,033 --> 00:41:52,567
Not even typed out

351
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,337
Have you ever been published before?
- We generally don't accept...

352
00:41:57,633 --> 00:42:00,769
stories from freelancers.
- l'm not a freelancer

353
00:42:01,133 --> 00:42:05,470
Nor do l fancy becoming a journalist.
l have come to you because...

354
00:42:05,733 --> 00:42:09,103
you have closed this issue.
- What's new in this report?

355
00:42:09,433 --> 00:42:14,538
A six-year old dead story.
- Dead, yes. Yery much dead

356
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:19,403
Because it contains no spice?
Give me my papers

357
00:42:20,633 --> 00:42:24,503
But tell me one thing, Mr. Menon.
What would you do if...

358
00:42:24,766 --> 00:42:28,836
a member of your family was missing?
Wouldn't you write anything about him?

359
00:42:30,066 --> 00:42:32,201
Would or would you not use
the standing of your newspaper?

360
00:42:32,566 --> 00:42:36,369
lf it was your sister who came to you,
would you throw her out this way?

361
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:41,569
And it being said of the pen being
mightier than the sword...

362
00:42:41,866 --> 00:42:43,300
is this the way...?

363
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:56,273
l got carried away. But the deeper
the pain, the louder the scream

364
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:03,136
Give me the report.
Let me see what l can do?

365
00:43:16,466 --> 00:43:19,402
Have you seen this news?
- Moron! l've seen it and read it

366
00:43:19,633 --> 00:43:27,741
Find out who penned this angst. Tell
her Y.K. Singh wants to see her. Now

367
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:32,436
Read this and mourn. This is how
our community has been persecuted

368
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,736
This is no time to sit passively.
We must take notice

369
00:43:36,666 --> 00:43:42,038
Call her, what's her name? Fiza.
Tell her Sheikh sahib has called her

370
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,936
l shall give her justice. l shall

371
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,002
Yes, l'm ready

372
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:56,933
Don't be nervous, Ammi

373
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:06,370
l looked for him everywhere.
But out there, it's pitch dark

374
00:44:06,699 --> 00:44:09,202
lt seems as if Aman lost his way
in the darkness

375
00:44:09,966 --> 00:44:14,603
My intention isn't only to find out
what my brother had been through

376
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,837
l also want to find out
why it had to happen

377
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,135
And who gained what?

378
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,603
Fiza Ikramullah is raising questions
for her country to answer

379
00:44:26,866 --> 00:44:30,302
For how long will this go on
in the name of religion?

380
00:44:30,633 --> 00:44:34,103
Who is to answer Fiza Ikramullah's
questions?

381
00:44:35,966 --> 00:44:39,102
Do you have his photograph?
- Yes

382
00:44:48,033 --> 00:44:49,567
Handsome boy

383
00:44:50,366 --> 00:44:52,301
What was he doing? Studying?

384
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:57,470
Books weren't for him.
He never liked studying

385
00:44:57,966 --> 00:45:02,270
But he was very good at
drawing, painting... handicrafts

386
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:07,471
Though he was uneducated, he would've
been successful in his life

387
00:45:08,966 --> 00:45:11,201
You mean to say that?
- Yes, that is what l mean

388
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,537
How is your family making a living?
- Ammi teaches Urdu. And there's...

389
00:45:16,766 --> 00:45:22,304
Abba's pension. The bank deposits
he left for us paid for my graduation

390
00:45:24,633 --> 00:45:28,970
So you're looking for your brother
so that he comes back...

391
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:31,235
and starts earning, to take care
of the household expenses

392
00:45:31,733 --> 00:45:33,701
l do not mean that at all

393
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:40,671
Now you're getting angry.
l asked because l wanted to know

394
00:45:41,033 --> 00:45:43,301
May we talk business?
- Why not?

395
00:45:44,066 --> 00:45:48,503
You're a well known figure now.
Were you to tell the people...

396
00:45:48,766 --> 00:45:53,570
that we aren't against any religion
or any sect, people would listen

397
00:45:54,599 --> 00:46:01,206
You see, the Mughals invaded us,
they dominated us. We forgave them

398
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:06,104
You people went away and made
another country for yourselves

399
00:46:06,366 --> 00:46:09,769
Not that we mind it.
- Don't say ''you people''

400
00:46:10,466 --> 00:46:15,337
Those who created Pakistan have gone
away. And most of those who didn't...

401
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:20,604
are dead. None of those who created
Pakistan are here any longer

402
00:46:21,099 --> 00:46:24,436
We are as much Hindustani
as you are

403
00:46:25,966 --> 00:46:30,470
You're getting angry again, Ms Fiza.
Look, what l meant to say is...

404
00:46:30,766 --> 00:46:34,336
for someone as educated and
open-minded as you are...

405
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:42,741
it's a must to know more about our
party. Whenever you have the time...

406
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:49,406
get in touch with our Youth Wing.
- You want me to become a member?

407
00:46:49,966 --> 00:46:56,706
That'd be nice! You help us, we help
you... takes two hands for clapping

408
00:46:56,966 --> 00:47:01,170
So you can put me on a flag and wave
me at the world? For Muslim votes?

409
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:08,139
l thought you're a liberal.
- You need say no more

410
00:47:08,766 --> 00:47:11,335
Do something, if you can do it

411
00:47:12,566 --> 00:47:16,670
Listen. . .
- Do remember what your Gita teaches

412
00:47:17,066 --> 00:47:19,568
To perform your duty,
without any expectations

413
00:47:20,333 --> 00:47:21,300
Bloody mosquitoes

414
00:47:22,533 --> 00:47:23,734
Thank you

415
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,434
Hail India

416
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,436
Help! Somebody help me!

417
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,968
What's up? why are you screaming?
- Kill that!

418
00:47:48,633 --> 00:47:51,402
Kill it!
- Scared of a rat?

419
00:47:51,866 --> 00:47:56,604
Yes! Kill it! It's going to chew
Ulfat Jaan to bits!

420
00:47:57,266 --> 00:47:59,534
Fool, if it even licks you...

421
00:47:59,866 --> 00:48:02,668
it's going to die of poisoning!

422
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:20,304
Won't come back, will it?
- If you sing out of tune, it will

423
00:48:21,266 --> 00:48:25,403
You say l sing out of tune? You're
out of tune! And your mother!

424
00:48:25,699 --> 00:48:29,437
And your grandmother! All you did
was to scare a rat away!

425
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:33,570
What d'you think you killed?
1 OO tigers? Get out of my house!

426
00:48:35,233 --> 00:48:41,238
You're such an ingrate, Ulfat! You
curse someone who does you a favor?

427
00:48:41,666 --> 00:48:47,238
Curse...? What half-caste is cursing?
It's just my style of talking

428
00:48:47,533 --> 00:48:50,669
lf you want to show-off your style,
go to a brothel

429
00:48:50,933 --> 00:48:55,404
This is a respectable neighborhood.
- Have your say! Were my fan here...

430
00:48:55,633 --> 00:49:03,273
he'd clam you shut!
- Let's hear who that ''fan' is

431
00:49:04,866 --> 00:49:12,006
Aman, my love! l was his soul-mate,
his confidante, his trustee

432
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,403
We had such fun! Like children

433
00:49:15,699 --> 00:49:20,204
But l always kept an eye on him.
To ward off the evil eye

434
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:28,736
Caught you! Now pay my ransom

435
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:33,737
Aman no! For God's sake!
Not that. Anything else

436
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:35,334
No way. Only that

437
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:36,734
The old men are watching

438
00:49:37,366 --> 00:49:42,270
Aman you're so nice, aren't you?
- Not at all. l'm evil!

439
00:49:43,066 --> 00:49:46,068
l'm going to cry.
- Why not? Do it fast!

440
00:49:46,333 --> 00:49:50,203
And as soon as you shut your eyes...
- Shameless!

441
00:49:50,533 --> 00:49:52,434
Call me names later.
First, my ransom

442
00:49:54,966 --> 00:49:55,866
No!

443
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:05,335
All right, if not that...

444
00:50:06,933 --> 00:50:09,669
a hundred sit-ups,
and you catch your ears. Start.

445
00:50:10,166 --> 00:50:11,600
All right

446
00:50:12,833 --> 00:50:13,767
One...

447
00:50:14,233 --> 00:50:15,434
Two...

448
00:50:17,866 --> 00:50:20,134
All right, shut your eyes.
- That's more like it

449
00:50:20,866 --> 00:50:22,767
On my lips.
- Cheek

450
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:27,737
All right. On the cheek.
- Shut your eyes!

451
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,435
Shehnaz, dear!

452
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,534
Aman

453
00:50:46,633 --> 00:50:48,801
What were you doing?
- Nothing!

454
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:50,467
Nothing?

455
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:52,601
Bye.
- Bye!

456
00:50:56,599 --> 00:50:58,301
What's going on?
- Oh that...

457
00:50:58,733 --> 00:51:02,570
we were playing hide-n-seek.
- l can see

458
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:06,203
Romantic hide-n-seek!
- No Ulfat Jaan! Nothing like that.

459
00:51:06,466 --> 00:51:09,669
ln my days, l played lots
of hide-n-seek

460
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,770
But time you know, put a blindfold
on my eyes, and forgot all about me

461
00:51:14,066 --> 00:51:18,303
l've been waiting to get caught!
- You won't tell Ammi, will you?

462
00:51:18,566 --> 00:51:22,970
Why?
- Because l'm the last of your fans!

463
00:51:23,233 --> 00:51:24,334
Prove it

464
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:34,404
Had l not spurned my fans, l would've
had a full-blooded son like you

465
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,839
Get going. Shehnaz ran away. Go after
her. Call her back. Go on, give chase!

466
00:51:44,133 --> 00:51:47,536
Tomorrow is going to be another day.
Don't miss out today!

467
00:52:57,133 --> 00:53:01,904
''Let me hold your hands to the Sun''

468
00:53:02,533 --> 00:53:07,504
''Let me say a prayer
holding your hands...''

469
00:53:07,933 --> 00:53:13,305
''this morning, the henna on your hands
Iooks so bright''

470
00:53:13,633 --> 00:53:24,543
''Come, my love''

471
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:36,138
''Come, my love''

472
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:47,305
''Hush, everyone will get to know''

473
00:53:47,666 --> 00:53:52,804
''Say it in my lips.
My lips can hear''

474
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:58,404
''All yesterday, l was pensive''

475
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:10,311
''Come to me, my love''

476
00:54:44,133 --> 00:54:49,238
''A ray of light dazzled me...''

477
00:54:49,633 --> 00:54:54,738
''when l saw you in the mirror''

478
00:54:55,233 --> 00:54:57,835
''A ray of light dazzled me...''

479
00:54:58,166 --> 00:55:01,269
''when l saw you in the mirror''

480
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:12,873
''lt is also a light
that pierces my heart''

481
00:55:17,766 --> 00:55:22,403
''Let me hold your hands to the Sun''

482
00:55:23,166 --> 00:55:28,237
''Let me say a prayer
holding your hands...''

483
00:55:28,566 --> 00:55:33,904
''this morning, the henna on your hands
Iooks so bright''

484
00:55:34,733 --> 00:55:45,343
''Come, my love''

485
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:30,505
''ln the red from evening's edge...''

486
00:56:30,933 --> 00:56:36,171
''paint me all over''

487
00:56:36,699 --> 00:56:39,069
''ln the red from evening's edge...''

488
00:56:39,366 --> 00:56:43,036
''paint me all over''

489
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:50,736
''Come, stop the Sun from hiding''

490
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,836
''ln the waters,
it will lose it's fire''

491
00:56:58,966 --> 00:57:04,104
''Hush, everyone will get to know''

492
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:09,538
''Say it in my lips.
My lips can hear''

493
00:57:10,166 --> 00:57:14,503
''All yesterday, l was pensive''

494
00:57:22,166 --> 00:57:27,271
''Come, my love''

495
00:58:24,166 --> 00:58:29,170
Shehnaz is getting married
the day after tomorrow. Do you know?

496
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:37,605
Why don't you go and tell her to wait
for Aman? He'll come back. He will

497
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:46,305
There are no secrets a mother doesn't
know. That's what l wanted too

498
00:58:46,633 --> 00:58:51,304
He'd marry Shehnaz, have babies.
Our family would go on

499
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:57,137
lf l had my way, l would've stopped
Shehnaz's wedding

500
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:04,839
But how do l tell Shehnaz
to wait any longer?

501
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,935
What a beautiful match!

502
00:59:27,266 --> 00:59:30,235
The band is out of tune!
What a bore!

503
00:59:31,866 --> 00:59:33,867
lt's the age of senseless tunes

504
00:59:34,266 --> 00:59:36,701
People with a sense of music
are sitting quietly

505
00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:43,502
Welcome sahib! We've been
waiting for you

506
00:59:46,433 --> 00:59:48,835
Please be seated

507
00:59:51,366 --> 00:59:53,034
Sahib, something chilled you?

508
00:59:54,566 --> 00:59:55,733
Here in a minute!

509
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:02,236
Who's that?
- Ulfat Bi! Hush!

510
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:05,935
He's Syed sahib. Yery big leader

511
01:00:19,166 --> 01:00:20,967
My best wishes.
- Thank you, Apa

512
01:00:21,266 --> 01:00:22,834
lt's all by dint of your good wishes

513
01:00:26,366 --> 01:00:31,104
Forgive me, Apa. l couldn't
wait any longer

514
01:00:31,833 --> 01:00:36,270
Why apologize to me?
If you can...

515
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:41,204
forgive that ill-fated fellow.
He has wronged you

516
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:46,234
Fiza my child...
- Yes?

517
01:00:46,733 --> 01:00:49,502
Syed sahib wants to meet you.
- All right

518
01:00:58,933 --> 01:01:00,301
Relax, my child

519
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:09,706
Your late father came to me often.
You were very young...

520
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:14,837
when he died. Heart attack, wasn't it?
- Yes

521
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:19,503
Have an ice cream, my child.
- No thanks

522
01:01:19,733 --> 01:01:21,000
l ordered it for you.
- No thanks

523
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:24,936
What are you doing these days?
- Trying to find a job

524
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:30,771
No big deal. l run a small school.
You can start tomorrow if you wish

525
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:38,939
Hazrat Allah Bahari put it aptly.
''Mothers, sisters, daughters...''

526
01:01:39,366 --> 01:01:43,937
''the world derives dignity from you.''
- Thank you. But l won't be able...

527
01:01:44,166 --> 01:01:46,568
to start from tomorrow.
- Any particular reason?

528
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,035
l'm busy with something important

529
01:01:52,533 --> 01:01:56,336
Some people think otherwise
of your efforts

530
01:01:57,733 --> 01:02:04,106
They say that you're trying to revisit
the apocalypse of 1 992-93

531
01:02:05,533 --> 01:02:07,534
lt could well turn out to be
a horrific illusion

532
01:02:09,533 --> 01:02:12,369
You might stand to gain from
the quest for your brother

533
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,936
But for the community, it might
turn out to be a grave loss

534
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,104
Will you consider that?
- You too should consider

535
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,369
Has or hasn't a sister the right
to look for her brother?

536
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:28,702
Does or does not a mother
have the right to hope for son?

537
01:02:29,266 --> 01:02:34,404
lf misconceptions are worrying you,
you should clear their doubts

538
01:02:34,866 --> 01:02:36,601
Disown me

539
01:02:39,133 --> 01:02:43,670
Get a hold on your emotions, my child.
Who says, l'm not on your side?

540
01:02:45,099 --> 01:02:52,140
Hear me out. The wounds have healed.
Dig up the wound, and blood will flow

541
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:56,936
Syed sahib, l don't know
how l'm supposed to react!

542
01:02:57,533 --> 01:03:03,505
Why are you people afraid of the truth
... you, the inspector, the editor...

543
01:03:04,233 --> 01:03:08,570
Y.K. Singh... everyone is telling me
to shut up! But why?

544
01:03:09,099 --> 01:03:11,101
And even if l were to shut up,
what'd come out of it?

545
01:03:11,633 --> 01:03:16,270
Even Justice Harikrishna's report has
been made public. But what use was it?

546
01:03:16,833 --> 01:03:21,938
We want to make peace!
You want to start a fight?

547
01:03:22,866 --> 01:03:29,105
Peace will be Syed sahib, when
every one stays within limits

548
01:03:29,933 --> 01:03:33,903
The truth is that the colors
green and the saffron...

549
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:41,471
are but parts of Hindustan's flag.
And parts are what they ought to be

550
01:03:42,166 --> 01:03:47,571
None of them must try to color
the entire flag. Do you get it?

551
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:49,767
Salaam

552
01:04:00,533 --> 01:04:03,402
See who's coming. Firecracker!
- Hi sparkler!

553
01:04:03,766 --> 01:04:08,070
You've become a TY star? Big TY star?
How about doing MTY Grind with us?

554
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,269
Hey, she's showing eyes!
- Whom are you giving that stare?

555
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,203
l'll fix you proper!

556
01:04:17,566 --> 01:04:18,700
No, don't!
- Leave me!

557
01:04:19,033 --> 01:04:21,802
What are you going to do?
Are we scared of you?

558
01:04:22,266 --> 01:04:25,602
Hey, she's getting Technicolor's!
Raspberry, what's happening to you?

559
01:04:25,966 --> 01:04:28,568
Hold your tongue! Else...
- Else, what will you do?

560
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:32,370
Help! Abdul! Riyaz! Sooraj!
Any of you here?

561
01:04:32,833 --> 01:04:34,234
Anyone here? Come on, out!

562
01:04:35,199 --> 01:04:37,669
Go on, get lost

563
01:04:38,133 --> 01:04:39,300
Move back!

564
01:04:39,566 --> 01:04:40,600
Let's get lost

565
01:04:41,133 --> 01:04:44,336
Why are you fellows running now?
Weren't you trying to scare women?

566
01:04:44,599 --> 01:04:46,268
lf you're men enough,
come on, face us!

567
01:04:46,766 --> 01:04:50,503
That was just the trailer.
- Wait for the rest of the movie

568
01:04:51,233 --> 01:04:59,574
Rascals! They torment the helpless.
- Don't ever say that Ammi

569
01:05:00,133 --> 01:05:02,502
We aren't helpless

570
01:05:08,133 --> 01:05:10,869
Flowers!

571
01:05:13,866 --> 01:05:15,133
He gave flowers

572
01:05:20,099 --> 01:05:22,936
l think l like your flower-boy

573
01:05:24,033 --> 01:05:29,805
Most importantly, there's an honesty
and a sympathy in his eyes

574
01:05:31,099 --> 01:05:33,969
Nowadays, he isn't even miserly
about flowers

575
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:38,770
What is it Ammi? You aren't thinking
about marrying me off to him, are you?

576
01:05:39,133 --> 01:05:45,038
What use is thinking? But l'm not
prejudiced about creed and caste

577
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,602
One must be clean at heart

578
01:05:49,699 --> 01:05:53,503
Why can't the Hindu bosom
have a Mussalman heart?

579
01:05:53,766 --> 01:05:55,801
And why not the Mussalman
with a Hindu heart?

580
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:02,004
Your Abba, Allah rest his soul,
used to say...

581
01:06:02,433 --> 01:06:06,236
love is the true religion.

582
01:06:07,533 --> 01:06:11,970
Come on. Now...
- Read the rest of the book tomorrow?

583
01:06:12,266 --> 01:06:13,433
As you wish!

584
01:06:17,666 --> 01:06:18,900
Any news of Aman?

585
01:06:20,066 --> 01:06:22,234
No.
- After the newspaper report...

586
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:25,903
the media and politicians apart,
has no one contacted you?

587
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,769
Who knows? Maybe no one else
actually read the report

588
01:06:31,033 --> 01:06:37,506
Nowadays, people only read headlines.
- Assuming he's alive...

589
01:06:37,766 --> 01:06:44,772
He is alive. My eyes can't be fooled.
l know it at heart

590
01:06:45,133 --> 01:06:48,302
Then, where is he? Why is he hiding?
Why doesn't he come back?

591
01:06:48,699 --> 01:06:52,136
Could he have joined some group?

592
01:06:54,266 --> 01:06:57,235
What group?
- Don't take this otherwise

593
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:01,770
l mean, some terrorist group,
some extremists. . .

594
01:07:03,099 --> 01:07:04,534
Show me Aman's photo

595
01:07:12,266 --> 01:07:13,433
What are you doing?

596
01:07:14,966 --> 01:07:17,902
Look at this. l downloaded this
from the internet

597
01:07:18,533 --> 01:07:19,667
Compare the eyes

598
01:07:30,666 --> 01:07:33,902
This terrorist was spotted
somewhere in the border area

599
01:07:35,166 --> 01:07:38,402
Border area?
- l'm coming with you, Fiza

600
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:43,738
Girls mustn't travel alone.
- It isn't about who's boy, who's girl

601
01:07:45,066 --> 01:07:49,603
l have to do this myself.
- Can l do nothing for you, Fiza?

602
01:07:51,366 --> 01:07:53,000
Take care of Ammi

603
01:09:21,633 --> 01:09:22,767
Sister...

604
01:09:23,699 --> 01:09:25,134
Want to take my photo?

605
01:09:25,633 --> 01:09:27,701
You must've seen all of the desert

606
01:09:28,466 --> 01:09:31,869
Thar is the backyard of my house

607
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:35,236
There isn't a roof over it.
But the backyard is vast

608
01:09:36,333 --> 01:09:39,769
You look like a city girl.
what are you doing here alone?

609
01:09:41,066 --> 01:09:46,471
l'm looking for someone.
- In this sea of sand and dust?

610
01:09:46,733 --> 01:09:50,803
Looking for someone? Tough to find.
- Have you seen him somewhere?

611
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,301
l haven't!

612
01:09:54,633 --> 01:09:59,738
Take a look, please.
- Don't you get too smart, girl!

613
01:09:59,966 --> 01:10:01,233
l'll carve you!

614
01:10:01,866 --> 01:10:05,603
Sister, please see!
- l haven't seen it!

615
01:10:06,966 --> 01:10:09,335
See it properly. For once!
- l told you!

616
01:10:09,633 --> 01:10:13,503
What's happening, Bhairav?
- Just another day

617
01:10:14,166 --> 01:10:16,334
You weren't up to something
yesterday night, were you?

618
01:10:16,633 --> 01:10:20,436
Listen to that! Nowadays,
it's an honest living

619
01:10:20,933 --> 01:10:24,569
What would you like?
Bread, and rice wine?

620
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:30,672
Shut up! You know what l'm asking.
Where is he?

621
01:10:30,933 --> 01:10:34,436
Reshma is inside. Getting dressed.
We're celebrating today

622
01:11:39,466 --> 01:11:43,002
''My love''

623
01:11:49,633 --> 01:11:52,135
''My love''

624
01:11:52,366 --> 01:11:54,434
''Let me drink from your eyes''

625
01:11:54,699 --> 01:11:56,835
''Something aches inside my heart''

626
01:11:57,066 --> 01:11:59,701
''Let me live the ecstasy''

627
01:12:01,766 --> 01:12:10,141
''The ecstasy''

628
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,102
''My love''

629
01:12:14,399 --> 01:12:16,702
''Let me drink from your eyes''

630
01:12:16,966 --> 01:12:19,201
''Something aches inside my heart''

631
01:12:19,466 --> 01:12:22,135
''Let me live the ecstasy''

632
01:12:24,433 --> 01:12:37,179
''The ecstasy''

633
01:12:56,633 --> 01:13:07,243
''The ecstasy''

634
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,204
''Kohl in my eyes
Anklets on my feet''

635
01:13:21,699 --> 01:13:26,204
''Worn to woo''

636
01:13:26,733 --> 01:13:32,305
''l pine, my love
Tell me when it will rain''

637
01:13:34,233 --> 01:13:40,038
''l have left home all dressed
to be your bride''

638
01:13:41,899 --> 01:13:49,107
''My love''

639
01:13:49,433 --> 01:13:51,835
''Let me drink from your eyes''

640
01:13:52,066 --> 01:13:54,201
''Something aches inside my heart''

641
01:13:54,466 --> 01:13:57,101
''Let me live the ecstasy''

642
01:13:59,399 --> 01:14:12,279
''The ecstasy''

643
01:14:16,933 --> 01:14:27,109
''The ecstasy''

644
01:14:42,133 --> 01:14:46,237
''lf there's an edge in my eyes...''

645
01:14:46,766 --> 01:14:51,303
''the one l fall for
will be the winner''

646
01:14:51,733 --> 01:14:54,268
''Make love to me''

647
01:14:54,533 --> 01:14:57,569
''This moment will pass''

648
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:05,072
''Take me tonight, who knows
what will happen tomorrow?''

649
01:15:07,066 --> 01:15:14,239
''My love''

650
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,802
''Let me drink from your eyes''

651
01:15:17,033 --> 01:15:19,268
''Something aches inside my heart''

652
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:22,169
''Let me live the ecstasy''

653
01:15:24,333 --> 01:15:37,179
''The ecstasy''

654
01:15:59,266 --> 01:16:01,968
''Ami, l have searched for Aman a lot''

655
01:16:02,566 --> 01:16:04,868
''But l see him only in my dreams''

656
01:16:05,666 --> 01:16:08,201
''l've had enough of this search''

657
01:16:27,433 --> 01:16:28,500
Listen...

658
01:18:00,666 --> 01:18:02,034
Aman, where have you been?

659
01:18:04,166 --> 01:18:06,034
Why did you leave us?

660
01:18:07,966 --> 01:18:10,134
Have we wronged you?

661
01:18:12,366 --> 01:18:14,968
Whatever we've been through
is now in the past!

662
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:21,773
But what have you done to yourself?
And in the company of people like...

663
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,601
They aren't that like that

664
01:18:26,933 --> 01:18:30,236
Then what are they like?
Tell me

665
01:18:31,233 --> 01:18:35,036
Why don't you say it? Say it!
Look at me in the eye, and say it!

666
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:41,037
What haven't l done to find you!
And this is how l find you!

667
01:18:41,466 --> 01:18:43,267
This? My brother...?!

668
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:52,338
l wanted to be happy to see you alive!
This is the happiness you give me?

669
01:19:00,133 --> 01:19:01,434
You want to know?

670
01:19:05,533 --> 01:19:06,767
Want to know?

671
01:19:08,699 --> 01:19:09,934
Then come with me

672
01:19:12,766 --> 01:19:14,067
Jehad

673
01:19:14,933 --> 01:19:16,467
What l'm doing is Jehad

674
01:19:17,399 --> 01:19:22,872
Against whom?
- Repression, injustice, apartheid

675
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,535
You fight for spoils
and you call it Jehad?

676
01:19:27,733 --> 01:19:33,705
What kind of Jehad involves robbery?
- We took only what we had a right to

677
01:19:36,399 --> 01:19:38,401
What about the rights of
your mother, your sister?

678
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:42,269
Have you come to argue with me?
- No

679
01:19:43,866 --> 01:19:50,405
But l'm still going to ask you
why you did what you did

680
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:52,102
Water... water
