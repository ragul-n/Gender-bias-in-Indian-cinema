You've got a death wish?

25
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,666
Such idiots seldom die, instead kill us.

26
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,833
Moron! Cough up cash, he needs to go to the hospital.

00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:25,916

00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,125
CRAZY BASTARDS!

39
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:20,666
Had to drug them to save my ass!

40
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:24,708
That's all I know.
Please let me go.

41
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:24,583
Images pass by, teasing me

42
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:29,208
Bombarding me with, visions and dreams

43
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,791
Images pass by, teasing me

44
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:37,708
Like the illusion, of a vision popping out

45
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,791
They shimmer, sparkle and vanish

46
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:45,791
leaving me directionless

47
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:49,625
I wonder why

48
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:53,666
With no trail to follow

49
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:57,875
And then I discover something of an image

50
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:01,791
Only to realize, I'm just facing my apathy

51
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:52,541
Behold, the flying ember about to scorch

52
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:55,791
Missing its target, igniting me

53
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,208
Where can I find a temple nearby?Missing its target, igniting me

54
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,083
Okay, thank you!Missing its target, igniting me

55
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,666
Missing its target, igniting me

56
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:06,416
Yet it cannot drive away the darkness within

57
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,958
Ma'am! ...........Your Bag.Yet it cannot drive away the darkness within

58
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:19,166
Just deafening silence all around

59
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:23,291
Is it for real? Or just a pretense

60
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:27,208
Everything is a delusion

61
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:31,416
A knife making love to the throat

62
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:36,666
Trespassing into the realms of the endless sky

63
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:35,500
Ma'am...

64
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,500
Don't you have any time sense?

65
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:40,541
Sorry ma'am... I was stuck in a traffic jam.

66
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:41,375
Where are you now?

67
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,166
At your gate.

68
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,291
Okay, get inside.

69
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,791
Maanasa ma'am !?!

70
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:54,625
Hello ma'am... I'm waiting in the living room.

71
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:59,041
Anish, sorry for the short notice.

72
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,916
Before we begin....

73
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,583
I have a surprise for you.

74
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,500
Would you like to...

75
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,458
Yeah.... sure ma'am.

76
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,000
Ok.

77
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Come to the bedroom.

78
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,291
Sure!

79
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,416
Not there! On the other side.

80
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:36,250
Do you see the wardrobe?

81
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,291
Where are you?

82
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,958
Please open it.

83
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:50,000
Looks like a big surprise!

84
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,750
FUCK!

85
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,291
FUUUUCK!!!

86
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,625
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS !?

87
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,208
I felt like, gifting a murder to someone today.

88
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,208
You got lucky, congratulations!

89
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,416
You're joking right !?

90
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,083
Who's that?
Why did you call me here?

91
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,416
How would I know why you killed him?

92
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,708
I hope you'll figure out?

93
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,666
But...

94
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,666
A gift without a wrapper ...

95
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,625
And a murder without a witness....

96
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,583
Sounds so wrong!

97
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:41,166
So I guess, there will be a witness soon?

98
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:41,708
before I forget...

99
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,333
There's a gun in the safe.

100
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,500
I hope it'll help.

101
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,000
Sorry, it had to be a surprise.

102
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:23,166
Hi!

103
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,500
Mr. Bhat?

104
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,333
Your shirt !?!

105
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,875
Am I late for the Auditions?

106
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,708
Hi, I'm Saakshi.

107
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:50,916
Hello?

108
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:52,958
You're wasting time...

109
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:54,666
He's watching you.

110
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,666
You heard her.

111
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,500
I hope you trust me now?

112
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,916
One more fucking person to add to my woes.

113
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:04,708
May I? Please.

114
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,583
I....

115
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,875
I didn't kill him.

116
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:39,083
Then, why don't we go to the police?

117
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,125
Now that you both are a team.

118
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,625
Together you will have to dispose the body now.

119
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,333
How you do it, is upto you.

120
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,416
You have time till evening.

121
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,875
Don't try and act smart,

122
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:28,625
the CCTV footage will be sent to the cops in no time.

123
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,333
The hard drive is missing!

124
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,250
WHAT!

125
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,541
I mean the CCTV hard drive is missing.

126
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,541
How can it not be? Keep looking.

127
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,541
You fucking BITCH!

128
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:28,541
It's fucking convenient to hide behind a phone and blackmail us.

129
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,000
Call me when you've grown a pair to confront me.

130
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:44,791
MOTHERFFF...

131
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:34,666
It's my Dad!

132
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,666
Should have listened to my parents.

133
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:51,041
I was an idiot...

134
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:53,791
that I came here.

135
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,000
Why so?

136
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:01,958
Every girl drea....

137
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,583
Every girl dreams of,

138
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:07,583
madly being loved by someone.

139
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:11,791
I can't explain the feeling Raj.

140
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,833
But at the same time, it makes sad.

141
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:17,875
I've made a mistake.

142
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,083
I should'nt have hidden the fact from you,

143
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,583
that I was already married.

144
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:26,958
Excuse me ma'am, you're done.

145
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:28,916
I haven't finished my audition yet.

146
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:33,916
So, when will you let me know?

147
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:35,750
Ma'am, here's your bag.

148
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:39,750
Why don't we try a Malayalam script?

149
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:41,291
IDIOTS!

150
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:32,416
Why are you late again?

151
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:40,125
My auditions were....

152
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:41,291
I had...

153
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,625
Had been to a crappy audition, mom.

154
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:48,708
Why do you trouble us so much?

155
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:51,083
Coconut chutney...

156
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:57,958
Why don't they conduct auditions during the day?

157
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:02,125
There were a lot of candidates.

158
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:19,250
So, what happens in these auditions?

159
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:20,958
Dad, you won't get it.

160
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:22,583
Huh?

161
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:24,875
We're given lines and asked to perform.

162
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:26,875
Mono acting?

163
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:28,583
depends...

164
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:33,208
Are we allowed too? Just to watch.

165
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,000
Dad, please...

166
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:37,458
What were you asked to do yesterday?

167
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:40,583
You should see Prashanth. What a sweet guy!

168
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:42,291
You both can be happily married.

169
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:45,250
His dental practice is going great!

170
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,833
You also can join him, right?

171
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:48,916
Mom... Please...
Can you stop that?

172
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:51,541
How many times do I have to tell you,
that I don't want to get married.

173
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:54,583
See, this is how she speaks to her mother.
We've had enough!

174
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:58,750
We can't take your filmy excuses anymore.
Just shut up and get married.

175
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,375
Hmm... Okay!

176
00:26:59,541 --> 00:27:02,416
What do you mean?
Stop... Listen to me...

177
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:05,375
Do you ever listen to us?
Just keep running away.

178
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:10,500
One Mr. Bhat called me and asked me to come here!

179
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,250
My bad luck!

180
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,333
Walked into this trap.

181
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm hungry. Can I get something to eat?

182
00:27:24,791 --> 00:27:26,708
Weed does that.

183
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:31,458
Sir...?

184
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:40,875
You got your answer?

185
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:43,333
Happy?

186
00:27:57,708 --> 00:27:58,958
Anish!!!

187
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,583
Anish...

188
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:03,041
Please spare me...Sir, you're mistaken...

189
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:05,041
I beg your mercy, you're mistaken...
Stop it...

190
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,958
Please let me go, I'll never come back again, please...

191
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:11,125
You son of a bitch... Where is she?

192
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:13,333
She's the one who sent you, right?

193
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:15,125
Where is she hiding? huh?

194
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:17,916
Only the cops can make you talk...

195
00:28:18,291 --> 00:28:19,291
Stop! you can't hide anymore.

196
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:26,750
PLEASE WILL YOU FUCKING STOP IT!

197
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,708
This afternoon...

198
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:55,791
...someone from this house got onto my rickshaw.

199
00:28:57,791 --> 00:28:59,958
Asked him for the fare after the ride.

200
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:02,291
"Come home and get it", he said.

201
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:04,208
That's why I'm here.

202
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,375
What were you doing in the backyard?

203
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:10,291
You were stalking like a thief.

204
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,333
I was here at 8...

205
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:15,458
didn't see him.

206
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:17,541
I was waiting at the gate...

207
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,916
Smelt something nice from the kitchen.

208
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:24,208
And I just followed the odour

209
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:27,750
Sorry...

210
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:34,958
My grandfather...

211
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:40,250
was a costumer at KVR drama company.

212
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,958
Oh! My fickle mind

213
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:44,875

On a wild horse back ride

Excuses are a zilch

As my identity melts away

236
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:02,333
I realize the futility of it all

237
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:05,208
As the faceless cast their nets

238
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:08,208
Imprisoning our lives in the web

239
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:10,625
Let's search for the ocean's end

240
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:13,583
From the place we are stuck at

241
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:19,083

Let's burn all our woes

244
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,958
Pain is nothing new to us

245
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:44,833
Let a state of consciousness spread

246
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:47,750
Beyond the cusp lies the abode of the Lord

247
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:50,500
Oh Lord!

248
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,500
Oh Mighty Lord!

249
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,208
Let's burn all our woes

250
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:59,083
Pain is nothing new to us

251
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:01,833
Let a state of consciousness spread

252
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:04,666
Beyond the cusp lies the abode of the Lord

253
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:07,541
Beckoning me to live the moment

254
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:10,291
A call rises from within

255
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:13,166
Like the waves of the ocean

256
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:17,666
They ambush me and vanish

257
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:26,666
Oh weed!... Smoking weed!
Heal my pains away with Thee

258
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:30,041
As the walls of my passion breaks

259

Blurring the lines of right and wrong

260
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:35,416
Swaying in the lap of euphoria

261
00:33:35,416 --> 00:33:38,708
Drowning away in the whirlpool of destiny

262
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:47,000
An accusation overwhelms me

263
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,750
Sacrificing me at the altar of a crime

264
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,250
Dragging me to the shadows

265
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:55,500
Spraying embers at the veil of my innocence

266
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,000
What I wanted from life eludes me

267
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,208
As I remember trying to reach for the skies

268
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:04,416
But I find myself being buried where I stand

269
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:14,125
Hello!

270
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:21,958
Oh weed!... Smoking weed!
Heal my pains away with Thee

271
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,125
Let it vanish

272
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:34,291
Oh weed!... Smoking weed!
Heal my pains away with Thee

273
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:41,958
Someone somewhere

274
00:34:41,958 --> 00:34:45,208
Moves us as pawns in a play

275
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,708
When the dice of destiny is rolled

276
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:50,791
My life rolls downhill to my grave

277
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:53,291
For the eyes to behold

278
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:56,416
I paint the floor with my life

279
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:58,916
As a spectacle in front of an audience

280
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:02,000
There I stand as a character among the dead

281
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:34,625
Sandalwood producer and miner, Mr. Manjunath Bhat
has been found murdered at his Kothanur bungalow.

282
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:39,375
3 suspects have been taken into custody from the crime scene
and the enquiry is underway.

283
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:44,208
The miscreants have committed the crime,
when Manjunath Bhat's wife wasn't home.

284
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:47,208
According to the cops,
the murder occured in the morning.

285
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:53,291
Upon learning the news, the wife collapsed
and has been hospitalised.

286
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:57,791
We have our reporter Shwetha at the hospital.

287
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:03,083
Shwetha, how is Mr Bhat's wife doing now?

288
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:08,791
It's confirmed.
The victim, Manjunath Bhat's wife has been hospitalised.

289
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:11,666
Her condition has improved is what the doctors have said.

290
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:14,041
We haven't heard anything else apart from this.

291
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:28,375
Sir, can you give us any information about the case?

292
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:35,333
How's she?

293
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,708
She's in a state of shock.

294
00:36:36,916 --> 00:36:38,166
Symptoms of PTSD.

295
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:41,166
We have to keep her under observation.

296
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:42,750
Can we get a statement?

297
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:43,375
Sure!

298
00:36:44,541 --> 00:36:46,875
Please make it quick, avoid stressing too much.

299
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,625
5 minutes, Madam is changing.

300
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:07,333
Your full name and relationship with the victim?

301
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:13,250
Name Kruthi Bhat.

302
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:16,291
And he's ...

303
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:17,458
my husband.

304
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:20,958
Are you a housewife?

305
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:23,375
Film Editor.

306
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:28,750
How long have you been married?

307
00:37:28,875 --> 00:37:31,083
2 years to last June.

308
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:34,291
Age?

309
00:37:37,541 --> 00:37:38,750
Thirty six!

310
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:41,666
Not you.

311
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,666
Fifty one.

312
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,750
I'm his second wife.

313
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:52,666
And the first one?

314
00:37:54,708 --> 00:37:55,958
They got separated.

315
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:06,791
He would run the quarry business.

316
00:38:06,791 --> 00:38:09,041
So the film production work was upon me.

317
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:15,125
Even in our busy schedules we'd make time for each other.

318
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,708
2 years just went by.

319
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:24,166
Then, we decided to have a child.

320
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:56,125
We've got the test results.

321
00:38:56,458 --> 00:38:57,916
I'm sorry!

322
00:38:58,458 --> 00:39:00,208
Even IVF is ruled out.

323
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,083
I'm sure there are other options?

324
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,166
I don't think so.

325
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:11,083
Doctor, in this time and age,

326
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:14,750
how can you say there's nothing you can do?

327
00:39:14,958 --> 00:39:16,291
I'm surprised!

328
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:20,291
Mr Bhat, it's not just a performance related issue.

329
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,875
In your case, aging has become a factor.

330
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:28,625
Unfortunately, you're not producing healthy sperms
which could be used.

331
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:32,583
There's an alternative though.

332
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:35,708
Only if you both agree to it.

333
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:37,375
Sperm donors.

334
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:46,833
We need time to think.

335
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:09,875
Did you give it a thought?

336
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:12,541
Why?

337
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:15,333
You want the world to know I'm impotent?

338
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,916
When did I say that?

339
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,750
Why get upset with me?

340
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,083
When the donor and doctors know...

341
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:24,958
Won't the media sniff it out too?

342
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,541
Why not go for adoption?

343
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:37,750
Without a baby bump and the due 9 months...

344
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:39,750
How would we explain the baby?

345
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:26,833
He's fine right?

346
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:32,416
Ok! Ok I'm coming.

347
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:45,291
Manju, are you ok !?!

348
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:48,083
It's nothing, just tripped and fell.

349
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,083
Is it a sprain?

350
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:51,333
Yeah. Slight sprain.

351
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:52,416
Should we call the doctor?

352
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:53,416
No need.

353
00:41:53,916 --> 00:41:55,250
Are you able to move it?

354
00:41:55,458 --> 00:41:56,958
It's just a sprain, nothing to worry.

355
00:41:57,208 --> 00:41:59,500
Meet Harish. He's been of great help.

356
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:01,750
Sir... It's Anish.

357
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:24,291
You're father should've stayed home.

358
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,583
He's my husband.

359
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:46,791
You are the dream that pulled me out
of the dark nights of my life

360
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:57,750
How I wish I could flaunt you to the world
under the bright sunlight

361
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:07,041
You haunt my every living moment
tenderly unfolding my fantasies

362
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:11,625
Relentlessly hovering on my mind

363
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:16,125
As I emerge from the long sleep, like a butterfly

364
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:20,625
I find myself drowning in your nector of love

365
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:25,125
And the sensual silence after

366
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:29,666
Has imprisoned me forever, Oh sweet one...

367
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,833
Apparently!

368
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:43,458
I can't give it to her anymore!

369
00:43:43,541 --> 00:43:45,208
But sir?

370
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,958
There's got to be other options, isn't it?

371
00:43:51,541 --> 00:43:53,125
We've tried it all.

372
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:56,458
It's a dead-end!

373
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:14,541
Anish...

374
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:17,083
Will you do me a favor?

375
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:18,166
Tell me sir.

376
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:21,333
You shouldn't refuse.

377
00:44:22,958 --> 00:44:25,208
Would you...

378
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:26,833
do it for me?

379
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:28,083
Sir?!

380
00:44:43,416 --> 00:44:45,916
There's this young chap...

381
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:50,458
working with us.

382
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:53,791
He has written a very good script.

383
00:44:56,875 --> 00:44:59,083
I'm thinking of....

384
00:44:59,958 --> 00:45:02,666
casting you as the protagonist in that film.

385
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:08,041
MANJUNATH!

386
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:09,375
TIME FOR BED.

387
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,625
Sir...
I'll leave...

388
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:13,333
Hey! Not so soon.

389
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:15,250
Even Kruthi is here...

390
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:17,166
let's have another drink.

391
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:17,958
Sit down.

392
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:21,083
Some other time sir.

393
00:45:22,375 --> 00:45:23,625
I think you should leave.

394
00:45:33,041 --> 00:45:34,125
Dinner?

395
00:45:36,791 --> 00:45:38,583
I feel...

396
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:41,583
This is our best option.

397
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:55,416
Kruthi....

398
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:57,000
Please open the door.

399
00:45:57,083 --> 00:45:58,708
Have you lost your mind?

400
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:02,541
Instead of all the practical options ahead of us,
you come up with something crazy like this?

401
00:46:07,041 --> 00:46:09,625
You'll understand later.

402
00:46:10,541 --> 00:46:12,166
Don't say no, please?

403
00:46:13,458 --> 00:46:17,416
If you are so keen,
why don't you ask him to be the sperm donor?

404
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:21,125
Kruthi, please...

405
00:46:25,375 --> 00:46:27,791
Do you even love me anymore?

406
00:47:09,458 --> 00:47:11,250
I'm doing this...

407
00:47:12,083 --> 00:47:14,500
Only because I love you.

408
00:47:17,583 --> 00:47:19,250
But....

409
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:26,166
I also want you to feel, loved...

410
00:47:29,041 --> 00:47:31,125
PHYSICALLY.

411
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:49,125
What are you saying Manjunath?

412
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:56,875
The thought of...

413
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:01,000
even you deserting me, like she did...

414
00:48:01,375 --> 00:48:04,291
scares me to death.

415
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:20,666
Anish agreed because he was promised a film.

416
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:26,625
The maid was set on a vacation, during my ovulation.

417
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:31,958
Anish would visit during the day.

418
00:48:32,541 --> 00:48:35,708
Manjunath would stay at work all day.

419
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:40,208
Probably, he didn't want it to be awkward for me.

420
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:27,625
Call me Earth and you my Sun
Let me dance around you in joy

421
00:49:30,041 --> 00:49:35,750
Intimate and passionate
Let's make every moment count

422
00:49:39,166 --> 00:49:49,541
Lovelorn am I, as you depart
Your attention is what nourishes my soul

423
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:59,750
Like the soft breeze brings the scents along

424
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:04,375
At this moment we become one

425
00:50:04,375 --> 00:50:11,083
Oh! Could this be love?

426
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:17,416
You are my ethereal rainbow

427
00:50:17,958 --> 00:50:22,875
And when I reach out just for a touch

428
00:50:23,583 --> 00:50:26,791
Its overcast in the horizon

429
00:50:29,041 --> 00:50:39,916
Come closer, let me feel your breath
Never ever let my heart pine for you again

430
00:50:42,583 --> 00:50:53,458
Come closer, touch my skin
Never ever let my heart pine for you again

431
00:50:56,750 --> 00:51:03,291
Call me Earth and you my Sun
Let me dance around you in joy

432
00:51:05,291 --> 00:51:11,666
Intimate and passionate
Let's make every moment count

433
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:14,583
Got to change the battery, I think.

434
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,666
I think it's the camcorder.

435
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:16,083
Madam..

436
00:52:16,083 --> 00:52:18,000
Please step out for a while.

437
00:52:19,291 --> 00:52:22,583
Go ahead.
I'll let you know if I need anything.

438
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:37,458
So, are you?

439
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:53,083
Due to unforeseen circumstances,
our crusher license was seized.

440
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:55,791
We had to stop all operations.

441
00:52:55,916 --> 00:52:58,208
Followed by a financial crunch...

442
00:52:58,583 --> 00:53:01,291
We had to shelve our film production.

443
00:53:01,375 --> 00:53:03,250
Anish kept calling relentlessly.

444
00:53:04,375 --> 00:53:07,416
Manjunath started avoiding him.

445
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:30,875
How come he's texting you?

446
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,541
Are you still seeing each other behind my back?

447
00:53:36,666 --> 00:53:39,583
I'll tell him to not message me again, EVER.

448
00:53:45,416 --> 00:53:46,666
Sorry!

449
00:53:47,875 --> 00:53:50,666
The crusher stress has taken a toll on me, I suppose.

450
00:54:01,208 --> 00:54:03,125
We need to get out of here.

451
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,583
How about...

452
00:54:07,625 --> 00:54:09,833
Going to the farmhouse for a few days?

453
00:54:16,041 --> 00:54:18,833
Is that Raaniyamma?

454
00:54:21,875 --> 00:54:23,666
Stop lying to me!

455
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:25,833
You used me!

456
00:54:28,291 --> 00:54:30,083
You're pregnant?

457
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,916
Don't you dare talk to her.

458
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:39,500
You want the truth?

459
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,583
You failed miserably too.

460
00:54:45,291 --> 00:54:46,083
Raaniyamma....

461
00:54:46,541 --> 00:54:47,291
Take the bag.

462
00:54:47,291 --> 00:54:48,541
Sure sir.

463
00:54:50,041 --> 00:54:51,500
Am I going alone?

464
00:54:52,916 --> 00:54:54,333
I totally forgot.

465
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:56,583
I've invited an actress for a meeting.

466
00:54:56,833 --> 00:54:57,833
You go ahead.

467
00:54:58,291 --> 00:55:00,000
I'll join you in the evening.

468
00:55:02,375 --> 00:55:03,458
I'm not going alone.

469
00:55:04,916 --> 00:55:06,250
Please try to understand.

470
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I won't be able to convince him in your presence.

471
00:55:27,208 --> 00:55:31,291
Do you know whom he was supposed to have a meeting with?

472
00:55:33,291 --> 00:55:37,208
Well, the girl who came home and got entangled in this.

473
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:40,000
I think it was the same person.

474
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,250
Get some sleep.

475
00:56:00,333 --> 00:56:01,333
It's my dad!

476
00:56:04,125 --> 00:56:05,250
Sir?

477
00:56:07,416 --> 00:56:08,833
Thirty six!

478
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:15,875
I'm hungry. Can I get something to eat?

479
00:56:16,583 --> 00:56:18,625
Painkiller!

480
00:57:44,333 --> 00:57:46,083
Pancake?

481
00:57:46,083 --> 00:57:47,125
No, thanks sir.

482
00:57:47,125 --> 00:57:48,791
Coffee...? Tea...?

483
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:49,875
No thanks sir.

484
00:57:49,875 --> 00:57:51,541
You asked me to come and see you?

485
00:57:58,291 --> 00:58:01,791
ASSHOLES!
Don't I deserve a decent Pancake?

486
00:58:12,833 --> 00:58:14,458
Your daughter...
What's her name?

487
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:16,208
Saakshi sir.

488
00:58:16,208 --> 00:58:17,875
She is a prime witness in this case.

489
00:58:17,875 --> 00:58:19,208
She has to show up when summoned.

490
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:21,375
As you say, sir.

491
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:26,291
Should I draft a requisition...

492
00:58:26,291 --> 00:58:27,333
for you to leave?

493
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:29,833
Thank you sir.

494
00:59:08,125 --> 00:59:14,083
Without a pause, the clock ticks away

495
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:19,833
Moments pass by and time flies

496
00:59:19,875 --> 00:59:25,875
Stuck in this maze of a life

497
00:59:25,875 --> 00:59:32,041
Hoping against hope

498
00:59:32,041 --> 00:59:38,208
In this crowded circus of a world

499
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:44,041
I remained a boycotted clown

500
00:59:44,083 --> 00:59:50,291
In this crowded circus of a family

501
00:59:50,291 --> 00:59:57,291
Why am I left behind?

502
00:59:57,291 --> 01:00:02,291
Pretext a galore

503
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:07,875
A dream finds me

504
01:00:07,875 --> 01:00:13,833
I greet with open arms

505
01:00:13,833 --> 01:00:19,958
Hoping for a tight embrace

506
01:00:19,958 --> 01:00:26,750
At the behest of the simplest of emotions

507
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:32,250
Complications find beautiful meanings

508
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:38,833
It feels like the stage is all mine

509
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:45,541
Yet I'm done with this one man show

510
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:50,625
Why this eerie silence?

511
01:00:50,625 --> 01:00:57,583
Haunting and posessing me

512
01:00:57,583 --> 01:01:03,375
I wonder what the horizon has to offer

513
01:01:03,375 --> 01:01:09,583
Beckoning and calling out my name

514
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:14,708
Why this eerie silence?

515
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:21,583
Haunting and posessing me

516
01:01:21,583 --> 01:01:26,708
I wonder what the horizon has to offer

517
01:01:26,708 --> 01:01:33,541
Beckoning and calling out my name

518
01:01:33,541 --> 01:01:35,541
In the company of my shadows
Rajanna...
Yes Sir...

519
01:01:35,583 --> 01:01:38,166
Expend my days and nights
Come home for dinner
Ok Sir...

520
01:01:38,166 --> 01:01:40,500
Expend my days and nights
Get the case files of Mr Bhat's murder when you come
Fine Sir.

521
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:46,333
The illusion of a roller coaster at it's end

522
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:49,416
To look back at the path travelled

523
01:01:49,416 --> 01:01:52,958
Nothing but again a maze of life

524
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:55,291
Spread amongst

525
01:01:55,291 --> 01:01:56,791
Terrifying silence

526
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:14,250
I've got the files.

527
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:16,333
And dinner too.

528
01:02:18,958 --> 01:02:20,458
Give me 5 mins.

529
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:22,916
Let me take a shower.

530
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:24,958
Yes sir...

531
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:33,666
Without a pause, the clock ticks away

532
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:40,125
Moments pass by and time flies

533
01:02:40,125 --> 01:02:47,416
Stuck in this maze of a life

534
01:02:47,416 --> 01:02:54,208
Hoping against hope

535
01:02:55,833 --> 01:02:56,541
Raajanna...

536
01:02:56,541 --> 01:02:57,791
Sir...

537
01:02:57,916 --> 01:02:59,791
What about the autopsy reports?

538
01:02:59,916 --> 01:03:02,500
They're running short of manpower.

539
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:04,708
Leading to delays.

540
01:03:04,833 --> 01:03:08,708
Had to get the initial findings on a phone call.

541
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:12,375
The report will take atleast a week.

542
01:03:13,625 --> 01:03:16,666
Time of death is between 7 and 9 in the morning.

543
01:03:16,791 --> 01:03:18,875
What surprises me is...

544
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,250
around the same time,

545
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:23,500
He had a mild heart attack.

546
01:03:23,625 --> 01:03:27,375
Sir, the fertility report is enclosed too.

547
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,458
Despite all our efforts...

548
01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:32,375
We couldn't find the CCTV footage.

549
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,583
By the way the pistol had

550
01:03:34,708 --> 01:03:39,375
Anish's and the Saakshi's finger prints

551
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:42,000
No other prints?

552
01:03:42,125 --> 01:03:43,583
I'm afraid not.

553
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:47,250
But the locker bore Anish's prints.

554
01:03:49,958 --> 01:03:51,375
Call records?

555
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,625
It's in there sir, in the file.

556
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:55,750
All of them.

557
01:03:55,875 --> 01:03:56,625
Raajanna.

558
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:57,333
Sir.

559
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:58,958
Dispath a search party again.

560
01:03:59,416 --> 01:04:00,583
Sure sir.

561
01:04:00,708 --> 01:04:03,375
Specifically look for medical reports.

562
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:05,333
Sure sir.

563
01:04:05,833 --> 01:04:08,708
Also about that Maanasa...

564
01:04:08,958 --> 01:04:11,833
and the other visitor who ran away.

565
01:04:11,958 --> 01:04:13,625
Yes sir.

566
01:04:13,708 --> 01:04:16,625
See if you can dig something out.

567
01:04:17,166 --> 01:04:18,083
Ok sir.

568
01:04:22,416 --> 01:04:24,500
I'll take your leave?

569
01:04:26,125 --> 01:04:28,041
Sir, why don't you eat something?

570
01:06:54,916 --> 01:06:55,833
Hello...

571
01:06:56,166 --> 01:06:59,291
Sir, It's Kumar from Airtel records division.

572
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:01,958
I have the information you requested for.

573
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:02,875
Tell me.

574
01:07:03,041 --> 01:07:07,666
There hasn't been any calls
from Kruthi's number to Anish's on that date.

575
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:12,291
Although Anish got around 5-6 calls
from a US based number.

576
01:07:12,416 --> 01:07:21,250
Also Miss Kruthi's phone has been triangulated
to a tower in Kanakpura the whole day.

577
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:23,333
Ok Thank you.

578
01:07:32,791 --> 01:07:33,666
Raajanna?

579
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:34,500
Tell me sir.

580
01:07:36,416 --> 01:07:38,041
Did we get the fingerprints on the window glass?

581
01:07:38,041 --> 01:07:39,166
I doubt, sir.

582
01:07:40,083 --> 01:07:41,208
Get it done

583
01:07:41,541 --> 01:07:42,041
Ok sir.

584
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:44,500
In fact.

585
01:07:45,041 --> 01:07:48,458
They were consulting for sexual problems.

586
01:07:49,458 --> 01:07:53,458
I suspected something more than just E.D.

587
01:07:56,041 --> 01:07:58,291
Erectile Dysfunction.

588
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:01,875
When the male organ gets dysfunctional...

589
01:08:01,875 --> 01:08:06,333
patients tend to seek treatment for that alone.

590
01:08:08,291 --> 01:08:10,583
Most of the time it happens...

591
01:08:10,583 --> 01:08:14,458
because of a heart condition called Atherosclerosis.

592
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:15,916
First and foremost...

593
01:08:15,916 --> 01:08:19,583
It reduces the blood flow to the smallest nerves...

594
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:21,875
and those are on the male organ.

595
01:08:21,875 --> 01:08:24,791
Was he on a treatment plan?

596
01:08:24,791 --> 01:08:27,000
Not yet.

597
01:08:27,041 --> 01:08:28,833
I'd put him on Aspirin.

598
01:08:29,333 --> 01:08:32,208
Suggested some lifestyle changes.

599
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:35,541
Stress and anxiety, was not good for him.

600
01:08:35,541 --> 01:08:38,416
Referred him to a cardiologist too.

601
01:08:38,416 --> 01:08:40,333
But he never visited I believe.

602
01:08:41,291 --> 01:08:44,000
In cases like these, normally out of insecurities,

603
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,125
patients refrain from follow ups.

604
01:10:06,625 --> 01:10:07,333
Hey!

605
01:10:07,833 --> 01:10:08,833
Karthik stop!

606
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:33,958
Sir...

607
01:10:35,166 --> 01:10:36,708
Well, this is Karthik's room.

608
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:23,541
Raajanna...

609
01:11:23,541 --> 01:11:23,916
Sir...

610
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:28,416
Can you visit the main branch of this bank
and get the account details and statement?

611
01:11:28,458 --> 01:11:29,000
Sure sir.

612
01:11:33,125 --> 01:11:36,916
Just two more weeks to your retirement
and you've come all alone?

613
01:11:36,916 --> 01:11:39,000
Getting a team along would've been safer,
don't you think?

614
01:11:39,583 --> 01:11:40,208
Let's go...

615
01:11:42,791 --> 01:11:43,958
Sir...

616
01:11:43,958 --> 01:11:46,041
Account is in Karthik's name.

617
01:11:46,875 --> 01:11:51,333
He seems to be on Manjunath Bhat's production house payroll.

618
01:11:53,125 --> 01:11:55,291
Kalakruthi Productions?

619
01:11:55,958 --> 01:11:57,291
Yes sir.

620
01:12:07,625 --> 01:12:08,791
Get the petty thief.

621
01:12:09,166 --> 01:12:09,750
Sure sir.

622
01:12:49,708 --> 01:12:53,208
You shouldn't act smart with the cops.

623
01:12:53,875 --> 01:12:56,583
Brooming, cleaning the shelf...

624
01:12:56,791 --> 01:12:59,583
I did everything they asked me to.

625
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:03,125
Today's wages, you see?

626
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:12,625
Sir?

627
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:26,375
That night...

628
01:13:26,791 --> 01:13:28,375
why did you go to that bungalow?

629
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:42,250
Sir... Sir...
I've got school duty, I can't come.

630
01:13:42,375 --> 01:13:45,000
Are you deaf?
Hey, don't you understand?!

631
01:13:45,125 --> 01:13:47,708
It's urgent!
Take me to the satellite bus stand.

632
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:52,000
You bitch! trying to doublecross me?

633
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:53,958
Should've known better.

634
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,916
Just give me my money.

635
01:14:07,333 --> 01:14:11,333
Sir... your balance amount?!

636
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:25,041
Fix him up with a petty case stating
he burgled Karthik's apartment.

637
01:15:25,208 --> 01:15:28,500
No need to file a chargesheet,
warn him and let him go.

638
01:15:30,708 --> 01:15:33,875
Karthik could use his ATM card.
Keep tracking.

639
01:15:34,166 --> 01:15:34,791
Ok sir.

640
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:40,000
What about the fingerprint reports I'd asked for?

641
01:15:40,125 --> 01:15:42,250
Not yet sir.
We should be getting it by tomorrow.

642
01:15:43,666 --> 01:15:46,541
Once you get it, run a search on Aadhar's biometric
database and get the details.

643
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:47,500
Sure sir.

644
01:16:36,375 --> 01:16:39,958
That night you got an international call at 8:15 PM.

645
01:16:40,041 --> 01:16:42,208
You spoke for 8 seconds.

646
01:16:42,291 --> 01:16:44,000
Who was it?

647
01:16:45,541 --> 01:16:46,500
You never mentioned anything about it!

648
01:16:47,083 --> 01:16:48,000
And that is why..

649
01:16:48,833 --> 01:16:52,500
I attend every damn audition.

650
01:16:53,625 --> 01:16:55,916
Just one breakthrough..

651
01:16:56,208 --> 01:16:59,083
and I could get my parents to shut up about my wedding
plans.

652
01:17:01,666 --> 01:17:02,500
How about you?

653
01:17:03,125 --> 01:17:04,500
Hmm?

654
01:17:05,083 --> 01:17:07,833
How did you walk into this trap?

655
01:17:12,166 --> 01:17:15,625
I too was called here for an audition.

656
01:17:16,166 --> 01:17:17,916
I didn't know it was Mr Bhat's film.

657
01:17:19,208 --> 01:17:21,041
Hope this is not an audition?

658
01:17:21,875 --> 01:17:23,291
You never know.

659
01:17:23,541 --> 01:17:26,916
Most people with that second name are somewhat crazy.

660
01:17:45,666 --> 01:17:48,958
Why don't you stop fooling around and tell her the truth?

661
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,625
Saakshi, don't trust him. He's lying.

662
01:17:56,583 --> 01:17:58,041
What does she mean?

663
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:00,416
How would I know?

664
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:04,541
Tell me the truth Anish.

665
01:18:04,666 --> 01:18:06,791
You are hiding something from me.

666
01:18:07,333 --> 01:18:08,416
How would I know?

667
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,625
You know how she's fucking with us since morning.

668
01:18:12,625 --> 01:18:13,416
I'm...

669
01:18:14,708 --> 01:18:16,000
I'm hungry.

670
01:18:17,041 --> 01:18:17,708
Huh?

671
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:32,208
You seem to be enjoying your stay here?

672
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:35,458
Will things get any better if we stay hungry?

673
01:18:35,458 --> 01:18:37,125
You talk as if, I committed a sin.

674
01:18:37,541 --> 01:18:38,708
RIGHT NOW!

675
01:18:38,708 --> 01:18:41,000
Every pleasure counts for a sin.

676
01:18:43,708 --> 01:18:46,125
Anish! Tell me the truth Anish.

677
01:18:46,125 --> 01:18:47,791
How do you like your eggs?

678
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:51,625
Anish I'm talking to you. What does she mean?

679
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:54,416
I DON'T KNOW!

680
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:55,500
ANISH, WILL YOU TELL ME THE

681
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:56,416
ENOUGH!

682
01:18:58,125 --> 01:19:00,458
I was called here for my sexual services.

683
01:19:10,875 --> 01:19:13,208
You got your answer?

684
01:19:13,541 --> 01:19:14,833
Happy?

685
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:16,250
Geegolo?

686
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:19,666
Gigolo.

687
01:19:22,333 --> 01:19:23,916
G...

688
01:19:28,125 --> 01:19:30,166
Male prostitute!

689
01:19:37,875 --> 01:19:39,458
Sir... Sir...

690
01:19:45,041 --> 01:19:48,125
I've told you everything that happened there.

691
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:50,958
Who will tell me what you were upto?

692
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:52,750
Get up.

693
01:19:59,291 --> 01:20:03,000
Hold it high.
Hold it!

694
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,583
Sir... Please sir...

695
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:10,833
Who's your pimp?

696
01:20:17,958 --> 01:20:18,791
Who the fuck is it?

697
01:20:18,791 --> 01:20:21,000
Sana...

698
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,625
Her name's Sana

699
01:20:24,041 --> 01:20:26,875
She's the one who handles my clients.

700
01:20:29,666 --> 01:20:32,083
The only mistake I made was...

701
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:35,166
I went to that bungalow without telling her
to make some extra cash.

702
01:20:35,875 --> 01:20:37,208
That's all I've done.

703
01:20:45,291 --> 01:20:48,041
You know who this is?

704
01:20:53,041 --> 01:20:55,750
Sir, I've met her once.

705
01:20:56,583 --> 01:20:58,125
I think at a party.

706
01:20:59,666 --> 01:21:01,875
She didn't even pay me.

707
01:21:05,333 --> 01:21:06,875
So?

708
01:21:07,041 --> 01:21:08,375
You kill people?

709
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,333
She's dead too?

710
01:21:15,166 --> 01:21:17,791
It wasn't me..

711
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:20,791
I swear, I'm telling you the truth.

712
01:21:20,791 --> 01:21:21,708
Raajanna...

713
01:21:25,083 --> 01:21:27,416
Sana has done all this, trust me.

714
01:21:44,583 --> 01:21:47,750
Sir... I think he's telling the truth.

715
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:50,916
What about the job I gave you?

716
01:22:27,791 --> 01:22:31,791
Karthik's Aadhar card copy.
We matched his finger prints.

717
01:22:35,458 --> 01:22:39,166
Make copies of his photo and give it to the team.

718
01:22:39,166 --> 01:22:41,166
Ok sir.

719
01:22:51,291 --> 01:22:52,791
Raajanna...

720
01:22:54,375 --> 01:22:56,875
I don't want this to be official.

721
01:23:00,916 --> 01:23:03,875
Especially the media shouldn't know.

722
01:23:10,375 --> 01:23:11,708
Sir....

723
01:23:12,458 --> 01:23:14,666
We've recovered data from Anish's phone.

724
01:23:15,416 --> 01:23:17,583
We got the CCTV footage.

725
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:27,916
Can we trace who sent the video?

726
01:23:27,916 --> 01:23:28,791
No sir...

727
01:23:28,791 --> 01:23:31,708
This hasn't come from a regular cell phone network.

728
01:23:31,708 --> 01:23:34,375
Rather from a calling or a messaging app.

729
01:23:34,958 --> 01:23:39,708
The calls Anish got on that day were VOIP calls.

730
01:23:42,416 --> 01:23:43,916

731
01:23:44,291 --> 01:23:46,333
With this app, the phone numbers are not linked.

732
01:23:46,708 --> 01:23:49,208
It just shows a random, server generated American phone number.

733
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:51,833
Can't we trace the server?

734
01:23:53,750 --> 01:24:00,125
We did try, but they seem to have used a VPN.
So, no luck there.

735
01:24:04,125 --> 01:24:08,000
Have you checked these phones?

736
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:11,500
I've checked Anish's and Manjunath's phones.
We got nothing there.

737
01:24:11,875 --> 01:24:14,291
Bheemsen's phone is Qwerty, so ruled out.

738
01:24:15,708 --> 01:24:18,750
We don't have Sakshi's and Kruthi Bhat's phones with us.

739
01:24:19,916 --> 01:24:22,041
Can we access those phones remotely?

740
01:24:22,083 --> 01:24:25,916
It could be done.
We need their phones for at least 5 minutes.

741
01:24:25,916 --> 01:24:27,708
To install a spy software.

742
01:24:30,833 --> 01:24:32,125
Check what's in the hard disk.

743
01:24:40,625 --> 01:24:42,916
Some pirated films.

744
01:24:42,916 --> 01:24:44,916
And yeah, some porn.

745
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:47,708
Blue films?

746
01:24:58,833 --> 01:25:01,250
Will you start talking?

747
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:03,333
Or should we go to the station?

748
01:25:06,416 --> 01:25:08,041
I know Kruthi.

749
01:25:09,041 --> 01:25:10,416
But honestly...

750
01:25:10,416 --> 01:25:12,416
I don't have anything to do with this.

751
01:25:13,583 --> 01:25:16,291
I just introduced them at a party.

752
01:25:16,958 --> 01:25:18,375
After that..

753
01:25:18,375 --> 01:25:22,500
I don't know what happened between them.

754
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:26,791
He would bypass me and take direct clients.

755
01:25:41,875 --> 01:25:44,625
You souldn't talk to anyone about this meeting.

756
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:47,166
Not even your friend.

757
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,125
Sir...

758
01:26:13,375 --> 01:26:16,000
I think Anish was telling the truth.

759
01:26:16,458 --> 01:26:20,750
You better go to the station, I'll see you later.

760
01:26:30,916 --> 01:26:32,416
How are you feeling now?

761
01:26:33,375 --> 01:26:36,166
I'm ok now, getting better.

762
01:26:37,583 --> 01:26:38,791
What's the matter?

763
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:45,458
With the investigation, I mean...

764
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:47,625
Going on.

765
01:26:54,458 --> 01:26:56,791
All evidences are pointing at Anish.

766
01:27:01,166 --> 01:27:04,041
Can I get you anything?
Tea... Coffee?

767
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:06,458
Juice.

768
01:27:12,541 --> 01:27:15,458
Do you know someone called Maanasa?

769
01:27:15,875 --> 01:27:18,625
Yeah... His first wife.
Why do you ask?

770
01:27:29,916 --> 01:27:31,416
Do you know where can I reach her?

771
01:27:31,416 --> 01:27:33,416
No...

772
01:27:36,083 --> 01:27:39,500
He kept saying she had settled abroad.

773
01:27:39,625 --> 01:27:41,541
Maybe he knew better.

774
01:27:43,916 --> 01:27:44,791
Let me do it...

775
01:27:44,833 --> 01:27:45,791
Yes Puneeth.

776
01:27:46,166 --> 01:27:47,833
Sir...Ready?

777
01:27:48,541 --> 01:27:49,750
My phone is low on battery.

778
01:27:49,875 --> 01:27:51,416
I'll call you in a minute.

779
01:27:53,833 --> 01:27:55,416
Madam, dial this number for me.

780
01:27:55,875 --> 01:27:56,458
Huh?

781
01:27:56,833 --> 01:27:57,916
Dial this number on your phone please...

782
01:28:14,041 --> 01:28:16,958
Puneeth... It's me.

783
01:28:17,791 --> 01:28:20,083
Sir, the procedure will take a couple of minutes.
Is it fine?

784
01:28:22,625 --> 01:28:26,458
I've sent you a link on WhatsApp.
Can you please install the app?

785
01:28:56,875 --> 01:28:58,208
Did you get the access?

786
01:28:58,208 --> 01:29:00,083
In a minute sir...

787
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:40,791
I think it's your phone.

788
01:29:41,791 --> 01:29:43,375
Some marketing call.

789
01:30:20,708 --> 01:30:22,333
Speak up.

790
01:30:22,833 --> 01:30:24,250
Will you?

791
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:27,916
It's all because of that Karthik.
Get him first.

792
01:30:59,708 --> 01:31:02,375
Madam... please open the urn.

793
01:31:27,166 --> 01:31:28,708
Where are you?

794
01:31:28,791 --> 01:31:30,500
Come to the quarry site immediately.

795
01:31:30,875 --> 01:31:32,375
No one should know.

Far away the road traverses

801
01:31:49,083 --> 01:31:53,875
And its a long ride

01:32:03,416 --> 01:32:10,541
Come to merge at this moment

Stop it Kruthi. I can't...
On the distressing silent seas

810
01:32:47,750 --> 01:32:48,666
I'm exhausted.

811
01:32:50,833 --> 01:32:55,333
It'll happen. Just don't think about it alright.

812
01:33:07,333 --> 01:33:10,291
No Kruthi. I can't.

813
01:33:10,333 --> 01:33:11,708
Kruthi, stop it.

814
01:33:12,291 --> 01:33:13,708
What's with you?

815
01:34:05,208 --> 01:34:06,041
It's okay.

816
01:34:08,583 --> 01:34:11,208
It's not okay...

817
01:34:13,416 --> 01:34:15,125
IT'S NOT OK.

818
01:34:18,708 --> 01:34:20,958
Don't you understand when I say No?

819
01:34:34,083 --> 01:34:36,500
EVEN I HAVE NEEDS.

820
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:20,958
Hi! How are you?

821
01:35:21,291 --> 01:35:22,291
Good! How are you?

822
01:35:22,416 --> 01:35:23,208
Good!

823
01:35:23,666 --> 01:35:24,500
Sweetheart

824
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:25,875
Do you mind getting us drinks?

825
01:35:26,375 --> 01:35:27,208
Yeah, sure.

826
01:35:32,333 --> 01:35:35,250
I think, your makeup is off?

827
01:35:42,416 --> 01:35:45,208
Did he? That Bastard?

828
01:35:46,166 --> 01:35:49,166
Why don't you give it back to him for once?

829
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,083
Piece of ass! Isn't he?

830
01:36:05,625 --> 01:36:07,083
My small gift for you!

831
01:36:21,208 --> 01:36:23,208
I think this will make you feel better.

832
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:08,583
Who did that to this pretty face !?!

833
01:37:09,375 --> 01:37:13,916
Apart from whoring around for money, what else do you do?

834
01:37:16,750 --> 01:37:18,041
I'm an actor!

835
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:21,375
You think I give a fuck?

836
01:37:30,458 --> 01:37:32,541
You wanna do it or not?

837
01:37:39,833 --> 01:37:41,416
Was it your boyfriend?

838
01:37:44,166 --> 01:37:46,625
Must be your husband.

839
01:37:47,166 --> 01:37:49,416
At this age, you couldn't possibly have a boyfriend.

840
01:37:50,250 --> 01:37:51,250
Just leave.

841
01:37:51,666 --> 01:37:53,541
Women like you, deserve it.

842
01:37:53,833 --> 01:37:55,875
Just, fuck off!

843
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:59,208
You know what?

844
01:37:59,208 --> 01:38:00,708
I thought you were just lonely...

845
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:01,583
But I realized that...

846
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:03,083
You are ugly too.

847
01:38:04,666 --> 01:38:05,666
Any problem?

848
01:38:33,208 --> 01:38:35,041
Do you love me?

849
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,750
Ofcourse ofcourse, why !?!

850
01:38:43,416 --> 01:38:46,041
Excuse me, please.

851
01:39:06,625 --> 01:39:09,375
If you can't handle yourself,
why drink so much?

852
01:39:20,125 --> 01:39:23,333
Let's just try one last time... Please...

853
01:39:27,416 --> 01:39:30,000
Don't create a scene.

854
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Just leave.

855
01:39:42,166 --> 01:39:43,750
Karthik...

856
01:39:44,625 --> 01:39:46,250

Like the virgin droplet of a rain

876
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:27,500
You filled an oasis in the endless desert of my life

877
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:36,875
You are the garland of green that adorns my path

878
01:43:36,875 --> 01:43:45,333
How does one express the ways of love, I wonder

879

If I ever see your face again...

883
01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:21,375
You're a dead man.

884
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,291
Gone without a trace.

885
01:44:39,333 --> 01:44:41,250
He's a bloody fraud!

886
01:44:41,250 --> 01:44:43,041
Siphoning off of us.

887
01:44:47,250 --> 01:44:48,041

888
01:44:52,125 --> 01:44:52,666

You are the voice of my soul

900

No, I don't think so.
Just...

915
01:48:10,375 --> 01:48:12,833
Your maid is a strong woman.

916
01:48:13,083 --> 01:48:14,458
Just like you.

917
01:48:19,958 --> 01:48:21,708
Jogging alone is so boring.

918
01:48:21,708 --> 01:48:23,250
Didn't feel like it, so came back.

919
01:48:28,291 --> 01:48:30,500
Where are you off to so early in the morning?

920
01:48:32,125 --> 01:48:33,500
Farmhouse.

921
01:48:34,666 --> 01:48:36,041
How's your headache.

922
01:48:36,041 --> 01:48:37,375
Did you take something?

923
01:48:38,416 --> 01:48:39,500
Yeah.

924
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:40,458
I did.

925
01:48:41,541 --> 01:48:42,458
Should I make some coffee for you?

926
01:48:42,458 --> 01:48:44,416
I'll do it myself.

927
01:48:52,625 --> 01:48:55,500
Looks like, you'll be gone for long.

928
01:48:56,958 --> 01:48:59,000
How will you manage alone?

929
01:48:59,708 --> 01:49:00,875
Why don't you take Raaniyamma along?

930
01:49:00,875 --> 01:49:02,833
I'll be fine.

931
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:05,875
What's for breakfast?

932
01:49:07,041 --> 01:49:08,291
Anyways...

933
01:49:08,291 --> 01:49:09,875
I'll get it from the restaurant.

934
01:49:31,875 --> 01:49:34,791
Are you upset because I sent Karthik away?

935
01:49:36,625 --> 01:49:37,625
It was awkward...

936
01:49:38,625 --> 01:49:39,625
couldn't help.

937
01:49:39,708 --> 01:49:41,708
Why would it upset me !?!

938
01:50:02,208 --> 01:50:03,791
Were you looking for this?

939
01:50:04,375 --> 01:50:05,625
Oh! Yes!

940
01:50:05,625 --> 01:50:06,708
Where did you find it !?!

941
01:50:06,708 --> 01:50:08,875
You'd left it right here.

942
01:50:09,208 --> 01:50:09,958
Ok, I'll get going?

943
01:50:15,416 --> 01:50:17,416
Haven't you forgotten something?

944
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,916
Did he call? When is he back?

945
01:50:31,708 --> 01:50:33,375
Anyways it doesn't matter.

946
01:50:33,375 --> 01:50:35,291
Listen, we have to make this quick, okay?

947
01:50:41,625 --> 01:50:42,708
What are you doing?

948
01:50:42,708 --> 01:50:44,333
Karthik...
Karthik, stop it!

949
01:50:44,375 --> 01:50:45,291
Karthik, just stop!

950
01:50:51,541 --> 01:50:53,375
Manjunath, listen to me...

951
01:50:55,583 --> 01:50:57,166
It was an accident Manju...

952
01:51:58,291 --> 01:52:00,208
Do you recall where the pills are?

953
01:52:14,333 --> 01:52:15,666
Take these, NOW!

954
01:53:50,875 --> 01:53:53,416
Sir, I'm innocent.

955
01:54:06,458 --> 01:54:08,500
You're a smart woman!

956
01:54:09,208 --> 01:54:10,875
I'm impressed.

957
01:55:56,708 --> 01:55:59,833
Raaniyamma... Go to the farmhouse now.

958
01:56:02,166 --> 01:56:03,416
I'll come later.
Okay?

959
01:56:03,416 --> 01:56:03,833
I'll come later.
Okay?

960
01:56:03,833 --> 01:56:04,500
You !?!

961
01:56:04,708 --> 01:56:06,166
Just go...

962
01:56:06,166 --> 01:56:08,333
Hold on, give me your phone.

963
01:56:23,083 --> 01:56:26,458
Remember!
If anyone asks you...

964
01:56:26,458 --> 01:56:30,541
tell them you went with me to the farmhouse
by 7 in the morning. Ok?

965
01:56:30,958 --> 01:56:32,583
Remember, don't forget!
Please leave.

966
02:00:41,791 --> 02:00:42,875
Where are you Raajanna?

967
02:00:42,875 --> 02:00:44,833
At the court sir.
About that lockup death case.

968
02:00:44,833 --> 02:00:47,875
You are going to retire in a week
and they're still not done with you?

969
02:00:48,375 --> 02:00:48,791
No sir.

970
02:00:48,791 --> 02:00:52,500
I'll take care of that case.
You come to the quarry immediately.

971
02:00:52,750 --> 02:00:54,000
Okay sir.

972
02:01:01,750 --> 02:01:02,708
Shall we?

973
02:01:10,083 --> 02:01:16,125
Young men with stars in their eyes hoping to
achieve something in films have turned murderers.

974
02:01:16,125 --> 02:01:20,958
Welcome to the special news bulletin for today, Suvarna
Murder Mystery.

975
02:01:20,958 --> 02:01:24,708
There's been a breakthrough in Manjunath Bhat's murder case
finally!

976
02:01:25,041 --> 02:01:30,375
The convicted have been identified as Anish and Karthik.

977
02:01:30,833 --> 02:01:33,416
Karthik and Anish were friends.

978
02:01:33,500 --> 02:01:39,791
One came with the dream of becoming a director
and the other wanted to be a star on screen.

979
02:01:39,958 --> 02:01:42,958
But the lady luck didn't smile on them.

980
02:01:43,208 --> 02:01:47,291
They had to survive and
Bangalore's cost of living wasn't easy on them.

981
02:01:47,458 --> 02:01:53,166
So Karthik joined Manjunath Bhat as a production assistant.

982
02:01:53,166 --> 02:01:59,541
On the other hand Anish, succumbed to flesh trade.

983
02:02:40,583 --> 02:02:42,500
Sir... Where to?

984
02:02:42,541 --> 02:02:43,041
Jayanagar.

985
02:02:43,041 --> 02:02:45,375
Guys, anyone wants to take this ride?

986
02:02:45,583 --> 02:02:47,041
Why don't you go yourself?

987
02:02:55,375 --> 02:02:56,625
Please get in.

988
02:03:12,166 --> 02:03:12,666
Hello sir.

989
02:03:12,666 --> 02:03:13,250
Hello.

990
02:03:13,916 --> 02:03:14,708
All done?

991
02:03:14,708 --> 02:03:15,166
Yeah...

992
02:03:15,208 --> 02:03:16,166
Farewell sir...

993
02:03:16,708 --> 02:03:18,416
Hi Sir... What happened with your court case?!

994
02:03:18,416 --> 02:03:18,958
It's finally done...

995
02:03:18,958 --> 02:03:20,958
Oh Great!
Farewell to you sir!

996
02:03:38,250 --> 02:03:40,958
Raajanna... Boss hasn't come.
He'll be late today.

997
02:04:55,041 --> 02:05:00,291
When our reporter got in touch with Anish's parents in
Tumkur,

998
02:05:00,416 --> 02:05:02,291
this was the reaction.

999
02:05:03,291 --> 02:05:04,833
Please gather yourself madam...

1000
02:05:05,583 --> 02:05:08,083
Were you aware of your son's profession?

1001
02:05:10,708 --> 02:05:13,666
Please say something.
Is he your only child?

1002
02:05:13,916 --> 02:05:15,458
What does your husband say about this?

1003
02:05:16,958 --> 02:05:18,875
Pushpa, go inside.

1004
02:05:19,041 --> 02:05:20,958
Sir, can you please answer one more question?

1005
02:05:21,041 --> 02:05:23,041
Look, we don't have anything to do with him anymore.

1006
02:05:23,208 --> 02:05:24,833
For God's sake leave us alone.

1007
02:05:27,833 --> 02:05:31,666
The ghastly act was captured on the CCTV in the house.

1008
02:05:31,791 --> 02:05:35,125
We've got it exclusively for you.

1009
02:05:35,166 --> 02:05:37,875
Viewer discretion is advised.

1010
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:07,791
Karthik is still at large and the police department is leaving no stone unturned.

1011
02:06:07,791 --> 02:06:12,458
A team of policemen is on guard at his hometown, Mysore.

1012
02:06:16,166 --> 02:06:17,291
Has she eaten lunch?

1013
02:06:27,750 --> 02:06:28,458
Hello...

1014
02:06:28,458 --> 02:06:30,958
Inspector Ashok?

1015
02:06:31,250 --> 02:06:31,625
Speaking...

1016
02:06:31,708 --> 02:06:34,541
It's regarding Manjunath Bhat murder case.

1017
02:06:34,541 --> 02:06:36,833
Can we meet?

1018
02:06:36,833 --> 02:06:38,833
Who's speaking?

1019
02:06:39,333 --> 02:06:40,833
Maanasa.

1020
02:07:04,166 --> 02:07:09,625
A thousand thoughts run amok

1021
02:07:09,625 --> 02:07:14,875
As a collage of emotions
come unbridled

1022
02:07:14,875 --> 02:07:20,125
A sense of self, diminishes

1023
02:07:20,125 --> 02:07:25,416
At the onslaught of a thousand dreams

1024
02:07:25,416 --> 02:07:31,166
Like a mirage, they shine and disappear

1025
02:07:31,166 --> 02:07:36,500
Aspirations and ambitions
paint the canvas of the sky

1026
02:07:36,500 --> 02:07:41,750
They float, lost in ether

1027
02:07:41,750 --> 02:07:47,125
Trying to find their way
to an unknown destination

1028
02:07:47,125 --> 02:07:52,375
They float, lost in ether

1029
02:07:52,375 --> 02:07:57,708
Trying to find their way
to an unknown destination

1030
02:07:57,708 --> 02:08:03,041
They float, lost in ether

1031
02:08:03,041 --> 02:08:14,583
Trying to find their way
to an unknown destination

1032
02:08:40,041 --> 02:08:45,041
Losing their way, wondering
at the place they have arrived

1033
02:08:45,041 --> 02:08:50,750
Brimming with emotions unfathomed

1034
02:08:50,750 --> 02:08:59,000
Losing themselves and disintegrating

1035
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,750
At the crossroads of fate

1036
02:09:01,750 --> 02:09:07,000
Melting and evaporating at a touch

1037
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,583
Churning the clouds of heaven and hell

1038
02:09:09,583 --> 02:09:14,750
Wrapping around and throttling life

1039
02:09:14,750 --> 02:09:22,541
Till one loses a sense of his own being

1040
02:09:22,541 --> 02:09:25,500
At the juncture where
the Sky meets Earth

1041
02:09:25,500 --> 02:09:33,250
My dreams might find
a sun rising again in the horizon

1042
02:09:33,250 --> 02:09:38,625
Will I be the star that shines,
or a flash of lightning in the darkened sky

1043
02:09:38,625 --> 02:09:40,958
My dreams refuse to die with me
