00:31:34,729 --> 00:31:35,441
Maybe?

364
00:31:35,843 --> 00:31:38,567
But if she says anything at home
We are dead meat!

365
00:32:58,873 --> 00:33:01,251
Look at what she's send him!

366

A love letter?

367
00:33:06,854 --> 00:33:09,134
She sent him her nails!

368
00:33:25,188 --> 00:33:26,182
He is crying

369
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,476

370
00:34:03,788 --> 00:34:06,324
Sapna and a cripple like me? Ha!

372
00:34:15,364 --> 00:34:16,028
Forget it!

373
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:21,483
Has he gone totally nuts?

374
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,170

Let's go

379

Nothing

381
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,796
I fell flat on my face

382
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,363
But your story is different

383
00:34:58,301 --> 00:34:59,204

398
00:36:08,853 --> 00:36:09,973

00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:40,297
Yes I do...Pradeep.

544
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,165
Such a nice name and you say he's a cripple?

545
00:51:44,555 --> 00:51:46,097
Better call him by his name.

546
00:51:47,957 --> 00:51:49,357
come, I'll show you our farm.

547
00:51:53,815 --> 00:51:57,121
As far as your eye can see, It's all ours.

548
00:51:58,133 --> 00:51:58,817
The whole field , we Yield.

549
00:52:01,845 --> 00:52:03,332
It's sugarcane here.

550
00:52:03,896 --> 00:52:05,159
Banana on the other side.

551
00:52:07,235 --> 00:52:08,556
No one's around at the moment.

552
00:52:09,663 --> 00:52:11,051
They've all gone for lunch.

553
00:52:13,288 --> 00:52:15,943
Aani, show us the farm on that side, will you?

554
00:52:16,337 --> 00:52:17,182
What's wrong?

555
00:52:17,575 --> 00:52:19,011
Aani was saying she'll show us
the well on the other side.

556
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:22,309
What?--Carry on.
The other side is all ours too.

557
00:52:34,663 --> 00:52:35,507
what are you looking at?

558
00:52:36,271 --> 00:52:36,570
Noothing.

559
00:52:37,549 --> 00:52:37,886
Noothing?

560
00:52:39,555 --> 00:52:40,966
So what are you staring at me for?

561
00:52:43,113 --> 00:52:43,815
I just can't believe it.

562
00:52:45,467 --> 00:52:46,591
That I am here and...
that you are talking to me.

563
00:52:48,883 --> 00:52:50,954
What's not to believe?
I am here... Iam real.

564
00:52:52,447 --> 00:52:53,186
I swear I still don't believe it.

565
00:52:58,038 --> 00:52:58,366
Now?

566
00:52:59,432 --> 00:53:00,331
Nope.--No?

567
00:53:01,502 --> 00:53:01,980
Now?

568
00:53:04,623 --> 00:53:05,132
You are a goner.

569
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:10,596
I naver dreamed we would meet like this.

570
00:53:15,622 --> 00:53:18,109

572
00:53:22,798 --> 00:53:24,068
Don't understand Marathi?

573
00:53:24,488 --> 00:53:25,094
You want it in english?

574
00:53:27,294 --> 00:53:27,750

At least answer.

586
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:46,692
Disconnected.

587
00:54:49,084 --> 00:54:50,200
Do you have any brains?

588
00:54:51,572 --> 00:54:52,411
why did you have to dance for so long?

589
00:54:53,462 --> 00:54:54,194
What if she doesn't call again?

590
00:54:55,478 --> 00:54:57,238
Too long with the dance

I'll kick you if it doesn't ring again.

594
00:55:08,051 --> 00:55:09,188
No damn balance in his phone!

595

Your mouth looks full of that shite.

639
00:57:54,482 --> 00:57:55,725

01:19:06,895 --> 01:19:08,094
Actually it was not necessary

786
01:19:08,867 --> 01:19:09,962
He wasn't the only one at fault

787
01:19:10,881 --> 01:19:11,811
It was the girl too

788
01:19:12,845 --> 01:19:15,293
Whatever they say has to be done

789
01:19:16,665 --> 01:19:17,790
It's all a Patil rule ..
a dictatorship

790
01:19:20,410 --> 01:19:22,382

01:19:40,753 --> 01:19:41,630
Why do such filthy things?

798
01:19:42,426 --> 01:19:43,153

799
01:19:43,892 --> 01:19:45,430

1110

01:57:58,891 --> 01:58:02,273
Broom it up a bit and you are good to go

1112
01:58:02,741 --> 01:58:03,790
I've been here 15 years!

1113
01:58:04,369 --> 01:58:07,762
The slum is full of only Telugu,
kannada people.

1114
01:58:09,419 --> 01:58:10,645
I've opened my shop already

1115

1117
01:58:14,740 --> 01:58:15,906
Eat when you are hungry

1118
01:58:17,350 --> 01:58:19,679

1126
02:00:01,562 --> 02:00:03,039
It's okay..
It'll clear off in a day or two

1127
02:00:28,692 --> 02:00:29,486
Hey. - It's okay

1128
02:00:56,953 --> 02:00:58,127

What? I wasn't stealing his remote

1132
02:01:19,316 --> 02:01:20,674
He's a smart ass, that little prick

1133
02:01:21,213 --> 02:01:23,344
Stares at me with anger like I am a terrorist

1134
02:01:33,270 --> 02:01:33,814
go to bed now

1135
02:01:34,665 --> 02:01:35,656
Make sure you lock up..

1136
02:01:36,516 --> 02:01:39,595
Call me If you need anything

1137
02:01:54,034 --> 02:01:55,180
Something stinks!

1138
02:01:56,969 --> 02:01:58,095
Where? I don't smell a thing

1139
02:01:58,667 --> 02:01:59,515
It's this quilt

1140
02:02:01,519 --> 02:02:02,385
It's nothing . Go to sleep

1141
02:02:04,604 --> 02:02:05,173
Sleep

1142
02:03:55,032 --> 02:03:55,584
Parshya..

1143
02:03:56,371 --> 02:03:57,858
You don't love me anymore, do you?

1144
02:03:58,494 --> 02:03:58,975
What?

1145
02:04:00,899 --> 02:04:02,601
Why did you leave without waking me?

1146
02:04:06,829 --> 02:04:08,498
You were in a deep slumber.That's why..

1147
02:04:12,216 --> 02:04:13,229
I helped Aunty at the shop

1148
02:04:14,048 --> 02:04:15,400
How long can we just live off  her?

1149
02:04:22,466 --> 02:04:23,232
What?

1150
02:04:32,582 --> 02:04:33,394

1202
02:11:37,607 --> 02:11:38,905
I really don't know what to do

1203
02:11:47,093 --> 02:11:49,667
I sit here all day and my  mind
is full of crazy thoughts

1204
02:11:54,294 --> 02:11:55,941

1218
02:14:08,749 --> 02:14:13,232
Mom, Dad , Brother, Sisters , cousins

1220
02:14:18,086 --> 02:14:21,864

You'll never learn, will you?

1229
02:17:55,790 --> 02:17:57,086
Why did you put so much salt?

1230
02:18:00,585 --> 02:18:01,452
Really? Is it that salty?

1231
02:18:13,134 --> 02:18:14,394
What's the password?

1232
02:18:15,934 --> 02:18:16,593
Parshya

1233
02:18:29,325 --> 02:18:30,260

1234
02:18:35,839 --> 02:18:36,806
who was it, Archie?

1235
02:18:39,145 --> 02:18:40,040
It was pooja, my colleague

1236
02:18:41,187 --> 02:18:41,797
So late?

1237
02:18:44,242 --> 02:18:47,590
I forgot to return her pen drive
That's why she called so late

1238
02:18:49,258 --> 02:18:50,163
Anything else?

1239
02:18:56,118 --> 02:18:57,678
Why do you keep changing passwords?

1240
02:19:00,033 --> 02:19:02,268
So that no one can look
into my phone at work

1241
02:19:09,598 --> 02:19:10,516
Where are you going?

1242
02:19:12,161 --> 02:19:14,291

I didn't say that

1247
02:19:23,523 --> 02:19:24,933
You don't have to actually say it

1248
02:19:26,601 --> 02:19:27,717
Must you go to work today?

1249
02:19:28,921 --> 02:19:30,739

She works in the factory

1269
02:21:36,024 --> 02:21:38,028
You've been standing here?

1270
02:21:38,175 --> 02:21:39,428

1289
02:22:43,121 --> 02:22:44,671

1290
02:22:45,011 --> 02:22:46,165

1316
02:24:55,497 --> 02:24:57,461
You've started to disgust me, you know!

1317
02:25:02,878 --> 02:25:04,526
What's there to cry? what?

1318
02:25:05,402 --> 02:25:07,454

1323
02:27:42,082 --> 02:27:43,301

1325
02:27:45,158 --> 02:27:46,283

02:28:03,458 --> 02:28:04,666
Not a joke , you know

1330
02:28:08,238 --> 02:28:10,663
I have told you so many times
Don't fight, stop fighting

1331
02:28:12,603 --> 02:28:14,632
You are both very stubborn

1332
02:28:17,660 --> 02:28:19,490
You can't live life like that

1333
02:28:23,181 --> 02:28:24,383
She's from a rich family

1334
02:28:25,412 --> 02:28:27,598
The daily quarrels, the slum

1335
02:28:28,418 --> 02:28:30,477
 It was too much for her
She must've gone back home

1336
02:28:33,018 --> 02:28:34,390
You should go if you feel like it

1337
02:28:36,321 --> 02:28:37,519
You are of course a man

1338
02:28:38,075 --> 02:28:39,188
who's going to stop you!

1339
02:28:49,823 --> 02:28:51,777
I ran away too when i was your age

1340
02:28:54,734 --> 02:28:57,900
 I was 3 months pregnant with sanket,
When his father abandoned us

1341
02:30:05,876 --> 02:30:11,171
Madam, give me...

1342
02:31:35,409 --> 02:31:37,011

1345
02:33:10,068 --> 02:33:11,956
I'll die without you, Archie!

1346
02:33:13,110 --> 02:33:15,786
Don't ever leave me, please!

1347
02:33:17,702 --> 02:33:19,402
Don't leave me , Archie!

1348
02:33:24,455 --> 02:33:27,757

1352
02:33:57,345 --> 02:34:47,464


1353
02:36:29,285 --> 02:36:31,988
I beg to the council elders..

1354
02:36:33,272 --> 02:36:35,306
Please forgive my grave mistake

1355
02:36:36,158 --> 02:36:39,931
The day my son left our home,
he was dead for me

1356
02:36:40,965 --> 02:36:46,800
I have nothing to do with him now
and never will in the future

1357
02:36:48,396 --> 02:36:51,756
I swear on all our Gods!

1358
02:36:53,616 --> 02:36:56,826
I had 3 proposals for my daughter...

1359
02:36:58,166 --> 02:36:59,477
But they all went back...

1360
02:37:01,321 --> 02:37:03,549
Don't push us into hell like this...

1361
02:37:05,464 --> 02:37:08,215
I beg of you...

1362
02:37:10,411 --> 02:37:13,398
