50
00:07:00,131 --> 00:07:01,373
5 minutes.

51
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,470
Actors are too much.

52
00:07:03,961 --> 00:07:07,456
when they want to promote there
film they will show up,

53
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:09,848

54
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,897
we don’t have this location, this
is the last shot.

55
00:07:14,273 --> 00:07:16,078
hurry up, 
only 15 minutes.

56
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,321
Priya and kids are waiting.

57
00:07:21,404 --> 00:07:24,941
according to the "science of construction"
kids must face to east.

58
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:29,251

59
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:33,260

60
00:07:33,605 --> 00:07:34,210
Morning Ms. Priya.

61
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,175
why?

62
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:44,667
according to "science of construction" 
kids must race towards east facing.

63
00:07:45,272 --> 00:07:47,348
and you racing track is west facing.

64
00:07:48,258 --> 00:07:50,105
but the ground is in round shape.

65
00:07:50,314 --> 00:07:54,571
when they will finish they will be
west facing.

66
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:56,533
till then everything will go wrong.
wrong?

67
00:07:56,653 --> 00:07:59,294
I think you are mistaken..

68
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:01,079
mom is never wrong.

69
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:04,512
mom did the complete course of
"science of construction".

70
00:08:05,357 --> 00:08:07,538
and that building in behind..

71
00:08:07,968 --> 00:08:09,648
that’s is also wrong.

72
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,511
that’s 40 years old building.

73
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:18,247
so what, you can fix the wrong,
anytime.

74
00:08:19,146 --> 00:08:21,473
Dad is calling..

75
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:25,146

76
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:27,139
you are still there.

77
00:08:27,623 --> 00:08:29,083
its my last shot.

78
00:08:29,203 --> 00:08:31,797
don’t miss this time, I am racing
in 200 meters race.

79
00:08:32,203 --> 00:08:35,376
I will come before your race.

80
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:41,720
your camera should be east facing.

81
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:46,395
if you didn’t cut this call, I will be
late.

82
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:47,824
all right, bye.

83
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:53,546

84
00:08:55,331 --> 00:08:57,939

85
00:08:58,059 --> 00:08:59,442
camera problem.

86
00:09:05,475 --> 00:09:08,345
Mom, where is dad?

87
00:09:11,645 --> 00:09:13,126
Cut.. Cut.. 

88
00:09:14,316 --> 00:09:15,798
come ‘on..

89
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:21,801
the race is about the start.

90
00:09:37,518 --> 00:09:38,342
what happen?

91
00:09:39,047 --> 00:09:40,069
focus problem.

92
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,256
you will win? 
will see.

93
00:10:01,606 --> 00:10:03,296
where is the east?

94
00:10:44,598 --> 00:10:46,549
forgive me, my father.

95
00:10:46,823 --> 00:10:50,267
get a side from TV.

96
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,053
its because of last shot.

97
00:10:53,356 --> 00:10:57,415
I told you camera should be east
facing.

98
00:10:58,795 --> 00:11:00,381
we can set shot according 
to "science of construction"

99
00:11:00,945 --> 00:11:04,034
and by the way I got late because
of traffic.

100
00:11:04,628 --> 00:11:08,124
I told you don’t buy a grey car.

101
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,253
you will always get stuck because
of its negative energy.

102
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:13,872
and that number plate too.

103
00:11:15,563 --> 00:11:18,797
you didn’t come that’s why, brother
lost in race.

104
00:11:21,004 --> 00:11:24,072
you didn’t practice and now the 
blame is on me..!

105
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:25,762
you could try hard.

106
00:11:25,882 --> 00:11:27,369
you work hard enough?

107
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,290
all your stuns done by duplicates.

108
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,220
they are the real hero.

109
00:11:35,617 --> 00:11:37,015
you are a fake hero.

110
00:11:40,545 --> 00:11:44,239
how dare you talk to your dad like this?
say sorry.

111
00:11:46,514 --> 00:11:47,536
I said say sorry.

112
00:11:48,603 --> 00:11:49,397
its okay Priya.

113
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,141
no, it is not.

114
00:11:52,517 --> 00:11:54,677
its okay, go.

115
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,732
no TV and games for a week.

116
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,630
I was my mistake.

117
00:12:09,445 --> 00:12:12,941
I was facing south, and according
to "science of construction"..

118
00:12:30,964 --> 00:12:35,075
I was thinking we should change
our room's color.

119
00:12:35,816 --> 00:12:39,427
red will be more romantic.

120
00:12:42,619 --> 00:12:44,038
all the world is my fan..

121
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:47,690
but my son thinks that..

122
00:12:48,963 --> 00:12:49,955
I am a fake hero.

123
00:12:53,287 --> 00:12:54,977
all the hard work done by duplicates.

124
00:12:57,137 --> 00:13:00,455
who says that,

125
00:13:01,302 --> 00:13:04,756
person who make happy his family,
that’s the real hero.

126
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:07,834
I am happy.

127
00:13:09,264 --> 00:13:10,203
and Kabeer?

128
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,058
those are just kids..

129
00:13:16,684 --> 00:13:19,042
they will forget in two days.

130
00:13:21,307 --> 00:13:22,131
no Priya..

131
00:13:23,482 --> 00:13:27,729
there must be some way which can
make me hero of my own kids.

132
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:33,155
otherwise all this money, award,
name, action, camera..

133
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,515
that’s not hero.

134
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:38,259
when a father is zero for his
kids.

135
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,371
there must be some way.

136
00:13:51,045 --> 00:13:54,103
how much time?

137
00:13:54,374 --> 00:13:56,972
wait my son.

138
00:13:57,505 --> 00:14:01,105
we are working on it.

139
00:14:02,032 --> 00:14:03,357
but it will take time.

140
00:14:03,795 --> 00:14:08,648
I am the killer.

141
00:14:19,838 --> 00:14:24,002
stop singing.

142
00:14:24,617 --> 00:14:27,362
or I will give you a kiss from this
stick.

143
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:28,585
kiss?

144
00:14:32,091 --> 00:14:34,772
listen what he is talking about.

145
00:14:35,503 --> 00:14:38,258
now think who will safe us?

146
00:14:38,603 --> 00:14:41,420
now only super hero can safe us.

147
00:14:41,817 --> 00:14:44,227
I know you one super hero.

148
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:57,189
he will fight with Toonasur?

149
00:15:01,163 --> 00:15:05,076
I must date him.

150
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,971
that right but who is this hero?

151
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:11,517
Aditya Kumar?

152
00:15:11,861 --> 00:15:13,239
he is our lord.

153
00:15:20,714 --> 00:15:23,448
you come with us on long drive.

154
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:25,253
but you can sit on the back seat.

155
00:15:26,188 --> 00:15:28,014
don’t watch..

156
00:15:28,546 --> 00:15:32,710
but how he will come here?

157
00:15:33,451 --> 00:15:34,786
why he would meet us?

158
00:15:46,421 --> 00:15:51,430
that’s Lucky Khan's plan..

159
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:54,456
he knows that you are busy till 2017.

160
00:15:54,925 --> 00:15:58,191
we must file case on them.

161
00:15:58,919 --> 00:15:59,754
that’s what they want.

162
00:16:00,516 --> 00:16:01,319
cheap publicity.

163
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,855
you are right, we should just watch.

164
00:16:04,262 --> 00:16:07,486
people will forget everything.

165
00:16:10,496 --> 00:16:11,874
but my kids wont forget.

166
00:16:13,721 --> 00:16:14,941

all right, but we want to listen
to our story.

186
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:34,205
no problem, come tomorrow.

187
00:17:42,332 --> 00:17:45,097
he is free after 10 years.

188
00:17:45,349 --> 00:17:47,227
will he safe us?

189
00:17:47,347 --> 00:17:48,803
so now what?

190
00:17:55,265 --> 00:17:56,433
kidnap?

191
00:17:59,918 --> 00:18:02,485
I wont go up.

192
00:18:02,945 --> 00:18:04,979
I work for the law.

193
00:18:05,424 --> 00:18:08,043
you want me to go against law?

194
00:18:08,325 --> 00:18:11,727
so after our work will be done, we
will let him go.

195
00:18:12,061 --> 00:18:15,097
he wont live here forever.

196
00:18:15,704 --> 00:18:19,784
you will look like a perfect hero.

197
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:22,737
not hero, producer.

198
00:18:24,753 --> 00:18:29,595
after 15 minutes this mask will
start melting.

199
00:18:30,252 --> 00:18:34,061
I think they only need 10 minutes.

200
00:18:34,374 --> 00:18:36,210
to kidnap Aditya.

201
00:18:41,397 --> 00:18:44,621
I told you to shut up.

202
00:18:45,913 --> 00:18:47,447
why you are hitting me?

203
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:50,160
you must done the job before coming
back.

204
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:03,891
when you will push the red button,
Aditya will go conscious.

205
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:25,347
I called you, you are Khana?

206
00:19:25,882 --> 00:19:29,909
did you bring Rs. 400,00,000 
and the script?

207
00:19:30,191 --> 00:19:31,683
yes, its in the van.

208
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:35,899
you wait, he is busy in shot.

209
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,465
you want tea or something?

210
00:19:37,997 --> 00:19:41,910
we are in hurry.

211
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,426
he is too much busy,

212
00:19:47,677 --> 00:19:49,983
next month shooting has been canceled,
please check.

213
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,245
ring the bell.

214
00:19:52,205 --> 00:19:54,564
I told you about him.

215
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:57,895
but is shooting time.

216
00:19:58,176 --> 00:19:59,950
there is a time shot.

217
00:20:00,608 --> 00:20:01,463
he bought Rs. 40000000.

218
00:20:01,964 --> 00:20:03,425
tell the story..

219
00:20:03,709 --> 00:20:09,219
not here, in the van its silence there.

220
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:11,410
bring my mobile.

221
00:20:11,963 --> 00:20:16,303
there are 10 super hit songs in movie.

222
00:20:16,555 --> 00:20:21,324
too much action too.

223
00:20:21,918 --> 00:20:27,661
shot is ready,

224
00:20:43,137 --> 00:20:45,088
you can not do anything to me..

225
00:20:46,562 --> 00:20:47,157
what happen?

226
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:51,206
I don’t know, nothing..

227
00:20:52,249 --> 00:20:53,366
try again.

228
00:20:55,027 --> 00:20:57,876
you can not do anything to me..

229
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,551
I think something is biting me..

230
00:21:19,538 --> 00:21:20,373
are you all right?

231
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:58,268
he is our hero.

232
00:22:12,952 --> 00:22:15,550
you can not do anything to me..

233
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:34,848
so you are saying that Aditya got
kidnap?

234
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:39,150
from studio with 200 hundred people around?

235
00:22:40,632 --> 00:22:43,136
and no one saw he going out.

236
00:22:44,002 --> 00:22:45,077
so that is possible too that..

237
00:22:45,362 --> 00:22:46,739
alien must have taken him.

238
00:22:49,525 --> 00:22:53,553
I mean we are working on all angels.

239
00:22:53,825 --> 00:22:54,962
you please sit.

240
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:01,798
our best man is looking this case.

241
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,992
we wont spear his kidnapers.

242
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:12,141
after you caught them.

243
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:19,584
the subject is very different from us.

244
00:23:21,285 --> 00:23:22,803
he is so handsome.

245
00:23:23,739 --> 00:23:25,680
and he is strong too.

246
00:23:27,444 --> 00:23:30,971
like big bang.

247
00:23:31,419 --> 00:23:32,296
get a side.

248
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:53,139

00:24:15,768 --> 00:24:18,210
he looks like this.

253
00:24:18,512 --> 00:24:21,956

254
00:24:25,692 --> 00:24:28,206
we can not trust those heroes.

255
00:24:38,288 --> 00:24:38,945

256
00:24:42,931 --> 00:24:46,156

257
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:58,240
I am not feeling well, I see cartoons,
I have family too.

258
00:24:58,572 --> 00:24:59,949
they must be waiting for me.

259
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,673
they must be worried, I must leave.

260
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:06,586
how come, we can let you go?

261
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,913

265
00:25:24,081 --> 00:25:25,020
yes.

266
00:25:26,596 --> 00:25:27,546
yes.

267
00:25:30,525 --> 00:25:31,527
yes.

268
00:25:34,626 --> 00:25:35,659
where are you running?

269
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,985
Hasunagar 325.

270
00:25:58,506 --> 00:25:59,581
Devnagar 420.

271
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:07,257
listen, wait..

272
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,453

273
00:27:37,227 --> 00:27:40,253

274
00:27:49,078 --> 00:27:51,530
take this too.

275
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,139
you think I am doing all this?

276
00:27:54,259 --> 00:27:56,320
this is film.

277
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,904
duplicates does all these action.

278
00:27:59,024 --> 00:28:02,264
he is not real hero.

279
00:28:03,787 --> 00:28:06,824
that’s film world.

280
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:11,077
different from real.

281
00:28:11,463 --> 00:28:15,407
but you look so cute.

282
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:24,267
I think we caught wrong person.

283
00:29:04,812 --> 00:29:07,254
don’t touch me.

284
00:29:08,195 --> 00:29:10,961
that’s real bomb.

285
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:14,195
what are you doing?

286
00:29:17,855 --> 00:29:20,735
its not duplicate.

287
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:36,878
look at our black faces.

288
00:29:36,998 --> 00:29:38,965
I am better then him.

289
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,644
I can do at least 2 or 3 fights.

290
00:29:44,637 --> 00:29:45,890
get a side.

291
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,848
who can wear these type of shoes?

292
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:08,166
I think those are imported, 

293
00:30:08,286 --> 00:30:11,026
hero could be kidnaper too.

294
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:21,843
don’t worry Priya, Aditya is famous
person.

295
00:30:22,391 --> 00:30:23,486
we will find him.

296
00:30:25,072 --> 00:30:28,745
where is Dad? when he will come?

297
00:30:29,152 --> 00:30:31,281
he will come soon, don’t worry.

298
00:30:38,405 --> 00:30:40,137
you are my kids favorite cartoons.

299
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:44,303
that’s why I am calm, or otherwise..

300
00:30:46,495 --> 00:30:49,740
we are in trouble, please help us.

301
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,298
but..

302
00:30:51,028 --> 00:30:51,967
please.

303
00:30:53,491 --> 00:30:56,287
but why Toonasur are after you?

304
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:58,128
did any cartoon dog bit them?

305
00:30:58,431 --> 00:31:00,445
that’s long story..

306
00:31:00,862 --> 00:31:02,146
so tell me in short.

307
00:31:02,803 --> 00:31:04,556
2 year later..

308
00:31:05,203 --> 00:31:06,883
it was democracy..

309
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:09,312
the milk was falling that time.

310
00:31:09,729 --> 00:31:11,785
gold sparrow was around.

311
00:31:13,047 --> 00:31:17,758
some time moon would come for
the dinner.

312
00:31:19,023 --> 00:31:23,061
Toonshaver King's policy was live
and let live others.

313
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:27,172
everyone one could live freely.

314
00:31:27,292 --> 00:31:30,918
one day his guard Jagaroo made a
plan.

315
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:33,057
he took his kingdom.

316
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:37,169
he show a game to the king.

317
00:31:38,317 --> 00:31:42,245
he kidnap the king.

318
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:48,553
since then he become the king.

319
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:54,150
we though you will safe us from them,
that’s why kidnap you.

320
00:31:57,072 --> 00:31:57,907
all right.

321
00:31:59,757 --> 00:32:02,804
I will make one last try, but..

322
00:32:03,326 --> 00:32:04,390
not with weapon.

323
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,560
with words.

324
00:32:07,364 --> 00:32:11,894
with words? I only know about fight.

325
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:13,251
what is with the words?

326
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:16,903
speech made most bad people in to
good people.

327
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,200
and those are only sad cartoons.

328
00:32:21,213 --> 00:32:28,173
he is right, after a handsome guy like
him will start with words,

329
00:32:28,658 --> 00:32:33,265
not only Toonasur he will win the hearts
of all the girls in the world.

330
00:32:34,089 --> 00:32:38,419
if this talk stay with the toonasur, then
it is fine.

331
00:32:41,886 --> 00:32:46,258
tomorrow morning we will start.

332
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:56,161
because of you dad left us.

333
00:32:56,281 --> 00:32:58,926
but what did I do?
why did you call dad a fake hero?

334
00:32:59,046 --> 00:33:00,178
why?

335
00:33:01,788 --> 00:33:02,372
what happen?

336
00:33:02,685 --> 00:33:04,824
he called dad a fake hero right?

337
00:33:04,944 --> 00:33:06,588
but I was angry that time.

338
00:33:08,925 --> 00:33:10,782
dad left not because of him.

339
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,792
Kabeer, you can not say anything like
that, no matter if you are angry.

340
00:33:15,042 --> 00:33:16,180
it could hurt anyone.

341
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:20,020
you know who is real hero?

342
00:33:21,053 --> 00:33:24,279
person who fight with 10 villain is
not real hero.

343
00:33:25,145 --> 00:33:29,267
person who fight with 10 problems,
that’s the real hero.

344
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:36,891
person who care about others 
is real hero.

345
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:40,376
and your dad got all these qualities.

346
00:33:41,743 --> 00:33:43,266
every dad's have it.

347
00:33:47,712 --> 00:33:49,778
don’t know where he is.

348
00:33:51,844 --> 00:33:53,107
we will find him.

349
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,779
all of us will find our own hero.

350
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:16,057
wake up..

351
00:34:16,547 --> 00:34:18,185
its morning.

352
00:34:21,235 --> 00:34:26,400
you sleep well? Toonpur looks new 
today.

353
00:34:27,193 --> 00:34:30,679
get ready, you have to go too far.

354
00:34:30,937 --> 00:34:34,923
you have to change the history of
Toonpur.

355
00:39:04,544 --> 00:39:06,203

356
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:11,546

357
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,182

358
00:39:33,274 --> 00:39:34,536

the middle.

367
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,544

368
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:14,464

I just want to say..

374
00:40:37,693 --> 00:40:40,761
leave the Tooneshvar Maharag,
and live in democracy.

375
00:40:41,659 --> 00:40:42,598
every person has right for democracy.

376
00:40:43,425 --> 00:40:44,521
I mean cartoon.

377
00:40:44,865 --> 00:40:46,900
what is democracy?

378
00:40:47,317 --> 00:40:52,149
where every thing done by the public.

379
00:40:52,669 --> 00:40:54,808
that’s the democracy.

380
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,650
if you will follow the path
of Gandhi Gee.

381
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,511
then Toonpur can also make progress
like India.

382
00:41:03,631 --> 00:41:04,717
its can be a better place.

383
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:08,704
Gandhi Gee said, if anyone give you a
slap give him other cheek too.

384
00:41:09,048 --> 00:41:12,335
you hit me, I will ask you to him more.

385
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:14,797
your name is speaker..

386
00:41:17,459 --> 00:41:19,358
why he is doing your job?

387
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:21,570
there is nothing in fighting.

388
00:41:21,987 --> 00:41:25,306
fool want to be friends with us.

389
00:41:25,634 --> 00:41:28,545
he will break his legs.

390
00:41:30,737 --> 00:41:33,011

391
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:36,945

393
00:41:38,401 --> 00:41:40,081
all us will live in peace.

394
00:41:40,201 --> 00:41:43,639
he is talking too much, aim and fire.

395
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,855
run..

396
00:41:56,375 --> 00:42:00,257
but Gandhi Gee said..

397
00:42:01,697 --> 00:42:04,535
he told about the slap not for bomb.

398
00:42:26,528 --> 00:42:29,314
what is all this brother?

399
00:42:36,674 --> 00:42:40,566

400
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,067
shut up.

401
00:43:19,844 --> 00:43:22,787
they wont listen to words.

402
00:43:24,289 --> 00:43:26,241
you all are safe.

403
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:29,268
but I got it, very well.

404
00:43:31,929 --> 00:43:32,774
sorry..

405
00:43:37,819 --> 00:43:41,450
I told you before, I am useless.

406
00:43:42,243 --> 00:43:43,464
I must leave now.

407
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:53,660
if everyone is angry, we must let
him out.

408
00:43:54,307 --> 00:43:57,197
then we would find other solution
for this problem.

409
00:44:02,656 --> 00:44:05,411
wait, he is my super hero..

410
00:44:05,661 --> 00:44:07,059
he wont leave like that.

411
00:44:07,751 --> 00:44:10,537
why are you saying like this?

412
00:44:10,913 --> 00:44:13,135
why you don’t want to help us?

413
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:18,585

414
00:44:20,317 --> 00:44:23,207
Boli you hero is zero.

415
00:44:23,666 --> 00:44:25,461
all my effort went waste.

416
00:44:25,978 --> 00:44:28,389

idea next time.

417
00:44:29,265 --> 00:44:34,691

lucky thing.

00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:40,284

every yellow thing is not money.

422
00:44:54,848 --> 00:44:57,373
he is not super star..

423
00:44:57,607 --> 00:45:02,188
we have to take him up again..

424
00:45:02,824 --> 00:45:04,911
hero can do only flirting.

425
00:45:14,093 --> 00:45:16,994

you.

426
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:20,961
they are right, you are fake hero.

427
00:45:21,081 --> 00:45:22,391

bad idea.

467
00:49:01,478 --> 00:49:03,317

I have stop using duplicates.

471

473
00:49:21,662 --> 00:49:22,695

but Jagaroo is unbeatable.

476
00:49:36,568 --> 00:49:38,300

where I can find Rabdood?

501
00:51:18,956 --> 00:51:20,886
no one knows where he is.

502
00:51:21,006 --> 00:51:23,575
we can call him by his poem.

503
00:51:23,985 --> 00:51:24,942
what poem?

504
00:51:25,062 --> 00:51:29,546
