00:00:57,158 --> 00:01:00,731
Hello to every Kannadiga and my fans
from yours Kichcha,

2
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:07,704
I thank audience in theatre for watching
the film produced by my company,

3
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:12,447
your love is my wealth
and my strength.

4
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,585
Watch Jigarthanda!

5
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:52,119
Greetings brother!

6
00:01:58,652 --> 00:01:59,460
Greetings, brother!

7
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:04,095
Greetings, brother.
- Please take your seat.

8
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:15,343
Rahul told us to present you a gift.

9
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:21,777
Sir, job is done.

10
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:23,079
Dead!

11
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:44,269
I'm nearby...coming.

12
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:29,555
Where were you?
Next is your program.

13
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:33,250
Future Director

14
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:49,064
We watched your short film
before the break.

15
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:55,307
There are 4 interesting
contestants in semi finals!

16
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:57,475
3 among them will reach finals.

17
00:03:57,538 --> 00:04:00,246
So, one of them will get eliminated.

18
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:03,483
What's your feeling right now, Rahul?

19
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:07,090
I think you're too confused, okay!

20
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:12,028
Let's ask the opinion of special
judges who watched Rahul's short film.

21
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:15,329
State Award winning
Director Guruprasad!

22
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,427
Famous film Producer K. Manju!

23
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,508
Guru sir, your comments please.

24
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:42,326
Trash film!

25
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:31,643
Manju sir, your comments please.

26
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:37,012
This is the best film
I've ever watched.

27
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,517
This film may appear like trash
to intelligentsia.

28
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,714
But for me it is gold!

29
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,555
This is the best film.

30
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:50,117
Tasteless real estate barons like you
have entered film production,

31
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:54,758
trash films are having a run in theatres,
films by intelligentsia don't get theatres.

32
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:59,493
Intelligentsia like you brand
good films as bad films,

33
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,733
that's why bad films rule box office.

34
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,702
Yes, I'm intelligent
not foolish like you.

35
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,641
Okay, I'm foolish,
you're intelligent, right?

36
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,441
You made a film, right?
It was a dud in box office.

37
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:11,745
You were after me to make a film,
did I come to you seeking chance?

38
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,007
Keep quiet, man.

39
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:15,576
Why are you stopping me?
That fool pestered me to make a film.

40
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,747
The film you produce is bad,
make your own film.

41
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,480
Why are you running away?
Sit here.

42
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,753
I'll lose my respect for judging
such cheap programs.

43
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,120
Do I need this?

44
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:25,390
Hey boys!
Where the hell are you?

45
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:26,453
Drop me in home.

46
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,194
Get lost, man!
Bloody film!

47
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:32,100
Don't pass comment on me.
I'll not take it easy.

48
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,001
Get lost!

49
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,165
I'll not tolerate fools like you.

50
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,106
Tell him to learn
the spelling of film.

51
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:38,541
Get lost, man!

52
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:41,306
Get lost, you...

53
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,785
I've made more reality shows
than films.

54
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,253
Will you telecast to embarrass me
by showing my fight with him?

55
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:55,019
Do I need this trouble?

56
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:56,550
You know he's mad, right sir?

57
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:58,494
If he's mad, why did you call me then?

58
00:06:58,552 --> 00:06:59,792
He calls me fool, bloody fool!

59
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,124
You know he's a fool.

60
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:03,498
If he's mad, why did you call me then?

61
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,230
Show will end with judgment, sir.

62
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:08,739
He gave it, right?

63
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:13,570
I'll give the judgment,
don't show what happened inside.

64
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:15,045
I'll not say a word,
et him do the talking.

65
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,979
Sir, you just come on the stage,
that's all.

66
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:19,111
Okay, go.
- I'll come...you go.

67
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:22,983
Program has reached climax!

68
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:27,453
3 among the four will reach finals.

69
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:33,556
1Winner among those 3 will get
the opportunity to make a film.

70
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,660
Let's ask our judges,
who gets eliminated here?

71
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,363
Ask him to tell, madam.

72
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:42,270
Sir, at least you announce it.

73
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,037
Contestant eliminated today is...

74
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,273
...it's Rahul!

75
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,209
Rahul! I reject you!

76
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,557
Please give the mic, madam.

77
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,562
Success in films is not restricted
only to intelligentsia.

78
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,393
Not the ones who reached final
from semi final.

79
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,991
One must have the capacity!

80
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:13,329
Only men like me have that knack
to find the winners.

81
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:15,999
I'm challenging you openly.

82
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:18,043
I'll produce that boy's film.

83
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:21,108
What's his name, madam?
- Rahul!

84
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:25,275
Rahul, I'll produce your film.
Meet me tomorrow.

85
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,683
Is it semi final?
Judge for this?

86
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,448
To hell with you.

87
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,581
Rahul, you're my film's director.

88
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:34,059
Get lost, man!

89
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:45,092
In an interesting turn right on stage,
Rahul finds a big producer for his film.

90
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,235
What's this injustice?

91
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:54,245
They're fighting and killing
each other in broad day light.

92
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,041
Isn't there anyone to stop them?

93
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:59,048
I'm already tensed about getting okay
for my story, you're irritating me.

94
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:02,144
I was really angry on that guy and
promised him in that mood.

95
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,688
Trusting that, he's here.

96
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:07,282
Your statement yesterday has created
great sensation in TV and print media.

97
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,224
Moreover that boy's uncle is reporter.

98
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,351
He has written a full page
article on you, sir.

99
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:12,954
Excuse me, sir is calling you.

100
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,966
Buddy, all the best.

101
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:20,562
Top angle camera shot, sir...
train is coming at full speed...

102
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:21,603
It is chugging in, sir...

103
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:24,438
While the train is chugging in,
we'll play the title song here, sir.

104
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:26,671
Train is coming...
song is playing...

105
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,008
Train is coming...
song is playing..

106
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,412
Train stops at station in full force.

107
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:34,075
Then...train stops, sir.

108
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:38,751
As soon train stops, hero gets down
and goes straight to Susheela's house.

109
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,083
When he reaches Susheela's house,
the door is locked.

110
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:44,095
He breaks open the lock and door,
he barges into the house and sees...

111
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:46,757
She'll be trying to hang herself, right?
- Yes, sir.

112
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,591
I know.
I'm sure this film will get award.

113
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:51,294
For you...but for me?

114
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:53,167
Sir, this is not art film.

115
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:58,199
A controversial subject to show atrocities
in society and create awareness

116
00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:59,403
With a super message, sir.

117
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:03,346
You'll make a controversial film,
who will run after courts then?

118
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,349
I'm not here to make films
to change society.

119
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:06,713
Action...make film on rowdyism.

120
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:10,284
Reap hooks, machetes, guns...
make films like Om, Duniya...

121
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,051
Take these CD's, watch these films.

122
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,250
Make a film like them.

123
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,088
If not make a one of these films
in reverse.

124
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:20,120
Tell me action, commercial subject,
I'll definitely produce the film.

125
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,432
Correct, no more excuses.

126
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,303
I'll get ready a good gangster story.

127
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:30,239
Excellent idea!

128
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,799
But not imaginary story.
- Then?

129
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:36,742
I'll find a real goon, study his life,
I'll get ready a good script.

130
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,215
Based on a true story!

131
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:42,276
There's on guy!
Interesting and weird!

132
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,184
Dirty too!

133
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:47,055
As you said a terror character
never seen in any film.

134
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:51,060
In Rudrapura.
- Rudrapura? Goon! Fixed!

135
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:53,496
Who is he, sir?
- Name...?

136
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,058
About 3 years ago, a man killed
4 people in Rudrapura market.

137
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:58,831
Yes.
- Don't think too much.

138
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,697
I'll find his case file.
- Okay, sir.

139
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:03,264
But beware!
Don't ever use his name anywhere.

140
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,172
No way!

141
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:05,801
He'll find and kill you.

142
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,340
He's psychopath dog!

143
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:11,714
Arumugha!

144
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,780
Assault Arumugha!

145
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,781
Assault Arumugha!

146
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:45,036
Rahul, there's an article about him
in this magazine.

147
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:46,336
It's scary to read also.

148
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,140
The man who wrote is uncle's friend.

149
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:51,648
Yes, brother-in-law, he wrote the article
under the pen name of Spider web.

150
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:54,652
But fearing retribution,
he used another name for him.

151
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,279
I'll give his contact number,
be careful.

152
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,390
You wrote it, right?
Isn't it?

153
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,350
You wrote it bravely,
why not use my photo?

154
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,326
You put a cartoon.

155
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:07,158
How many people
would've laughed at it?

156
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,228
Making fun?

157
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:18,104
Give me match box.

158
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:21,778
Do you've?
- No, brother.

159
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:24,481
Get it quickly...gO!

160
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,113
Brother, I'll do it.

161
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:30,212
Why are you itching
to get name quickly?

162
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:31,381
You're new to the gang.

163
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:35,221
Watch us how we do it.
Climb steps one by one to reach top.

164
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:36,226
<i>Go! “'2?</i>

165
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:37,261
Move aside.

166
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,364
Hey Busa! Come here!

167
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:43,594
Got saved!

168
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:48,297
Truth alias Spider web!

169
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,367
Truth burns!

170
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:58,576
But the truth in my world
burns devastatingly.

171
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:32,012
Aren't you feel it is little risky?
- Little?

172
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:35,619
I'll go to Rudrapura,
I'll make a film on Arumugha's life.

173
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,286
Isn't Rudrapura rings bell
about someone in college?

174
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:42,282
Chikka!

175
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:51,461
Hey you blue shirt!

176
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:52,730
Why are you staring at me?

177
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:58,538
The man who is staring with wide eyes,
that guy owes me money.

178
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,772
Why are you staring?
Come...come...

179
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:03,105
Come down...come...
- Give the bag.

180
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,546
Get lost.

181
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:06,709
You come with me.
- Hello, I don't want auto.

182
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:10,152
Hey you, come quietly.
Brother told me to get you.

183
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:11,415
Oh my God!

184
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,708
Hey you!

185
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,350
You'd have wetted your pant, right?

186
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:44,651
We met last time in college,
I wanted a grand entry, how was it?

187
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:46,715
How come you're here suddenly?

188
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,014
Just for a month only.

189
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:51,561
I'll gather information about Arumugha,
write a good story and push off from here.

190
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:55,031
They're blood sucking demons,
you can't near them easily.

191
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:57,691
I'm warning him, but he's walking
carelessly with a towel.

192
00:15:57,757 --> 00:16:00,294
Rahul...nonsense...

193
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,638
I'm telling you,
can't you understand it?

194
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:08,239
We can achieve something in life
only if we take risk.

195
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:12,477
I took risk, my wife will deliver
child in 5 months and I'll become dad.

196
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,983
Is it an achievement
to father a child?

197
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,985
In modern times,
it is also an achievement.

198
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,988
Out of 10 men, only <i>7</i> are able
to become fathers.

199
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:24,461
I'm a man among those <i>7</i> men.
You pack your bags.

200
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,462
I'm telling you,
can't you understand? Go away.

201
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:29,693
Go away...

202
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,766
Leave the bag, Chikka.

203
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:47,717
I brought this for you, buddy.

204
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:52,018
Stay for tonight and
leave by morning bus.

205
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:00,594
Have it.

206
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,394
Water?
- May throw up.

207
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:05,261
Cheers!

208
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:11,371
Arumugha is a type of nasty man.

209
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:14,140
People around him are goons.

210
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,111
They'll beat up anyone
without mercy.

211
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,476
Do you need this?

212
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,108
You want a story for your film, right?

213
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,686
I've 4 super stories.

214
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,551
I'll tell you, are you interested?

215
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:27,520
Are you telling me the truth?

216
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,652
Do I look handsome on screen?

217
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:34,428
Second hero!
- Second hero?

218
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:38,696
Comedy, right?
- I swear, buddy.

219
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,569
Am I so ordinary?

220
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:44,768
You'll give good opportunities, right?

221
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:51,412
If he's a goon,
is Arumugha so great?

222
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:53,111
Is he tiger or lion?

223
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:57,177
If I punch his face,
he'll bleed to death.

224
00:17:57,344 --> 00:18:00,553
We'll meet him and his father too.

225
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:06,359
You'll start film shoot from tomorrow,
and break the coconut.

226
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:11,666
Should we've to go?
- Second hero.

227
00:18:11,725 --> 00:18:12,635
Let's go.

228
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,074
He's asking something
about Arumugha.

229
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:25,409
I don't know.

230
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:28,586
My wife too didn't give me back pain.

231
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:32,086
Buddy, I need a favour from you.
- What?

232
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:35,284
I know a girl,
give her second heroine's role.

233
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:40,596
Hey, that's Arumugha!

234
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:47,271
If he raises hand,
real estate flies away...

235
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:52,338
If he roars in Bengaluru...
Manguluru will shiver...

236
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:56,609
Gun in pocket...
chewing betel leaf...

237
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,011
There's a infamous goon Arumugha
in Rudrapura...

238
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:02,076
When I ask money,
never dare say no...

239
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:09,391
This is Arumugha's fort!

240
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:15,464
This is Arumugha's fort!

241
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,231
This is Arumugha's fort!

242
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,475
This is Arumugha's fort!

243
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,173
Any information about Arumugha?

244
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:32,546
Sir, we can't give any information.

245
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:35,186
Scrap metal shop...

246
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:38,313
Real estate...kangaroo court...

247
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:42,585
Built an business empire of his own!

248
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:49,591
How can you talk like this?
- I'll talk like this only.

249
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:52,694
Inspector, we didn't do anything,
he opened and we closed it.

250
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:56,007
They all joined to kill my brother,
tell him to deny it.

251
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:59,008
That's old account, it's settled now.
Don't talk too much.

252
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,545
What will you do?

253
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,514
Do you know anything about Arumugha?
Can you please tell me?

254
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:09,577
I should've killed him 3 years ago,
but...

255
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:13,352
What happened, sir?

256
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:18,123
I'll go mad to leave anything
half done...

257
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:21,631
One shot two birds...

258
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:27,527
I'm the hunter to hunt...

259
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:46,052
What are you looking at?

260
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,323
Attacking me?

261
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:56,634
Watch, I made it!

262
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:03,673
This is Arumugha's fort!

263
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:28,027
Right hand of Arumugha is Basi.

264
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:31,534
Once childhood friend,
now man Friday of Arumugha.

265
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:35,198
He's with Arumugha since he
entered the life of violence.

266
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:39,710
If there's one who can do anything
for Arumugha, is Basi.

267
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:42,747
He has only one weakness,
drinking habit.

268
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,646
Boosa is the other hand of Arumugha.

269
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:49,150
Very few have survived
after hit by him.

270
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:51,551
Body is grown but not brain.

271
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:54,717
Cigarette, wine or woman,
no bad habits.

272
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:57,057
Very loving husband and father.

273
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,561
God fearing too.

274
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:02,055
But one must have weakness, right?
Blue films.

275
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:04,168
Can't get sleep without
watching a film every day.

276
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:09,172
Apart of them if there's one man whom
this town fears is Garagasa Krishna.

277
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,635
People are scared to go to him.

278
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:19,617
If anyone goes for a beedi also,
he'll narrate story to make your ears bleed.

279
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:22,279
Oldest man in town.

280
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:29,252
He has seen Arumugha
from childhood days,

281
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:31,623
I'm sure he'll have
his complete details.

282
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:34,663
If I take risk and
have little extra patience,

283
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:36,132
I can get information.

284
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:51,614
Arumugha is very dangerous.

285
00:22:57,744 --> 00:22:59,189
He's like a film.

286
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:01,225
If you go near, he'll smash you.

287
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:04,260
To near him, we've only 3 options.

288
00:23:04,317 --> 00:23:08,993
Basi...Boosa...Krishnappa!

289
00:23:09,122 --> 00:23:11,102
Welcome.
- Greetings, sir.

290
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:13,660
I'm making a film on him,
Arumugha mustn't know about this.

291
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,536
If he comes to know...
- He'll finish you.

292
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:19,008
Did you take so many
days to find this?

293
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:21,510
I told you about
this on day one itself.

294
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:24,739
Are you packing your bags?

295
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:28,142
Must write story about Arumugha
with full details.

296
00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:32,188
The one and only to help me in this
dangerous operation is future super star!

297
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:34,350
My film's second hero Chikka!

298
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:41,029
You use and throw me out.

299
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,465
Is Ammulu second heroine?

300
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:47,698
As far as I know...
- He's calling you.

301
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:49,472
I'll come back now.

302
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:51,699
How did Arumugha become
what he is now?

303
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:54,369
That's the question.

304
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:59,380
Arumugha! I'm waiting.

305
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:17,594
This sari is nice.

306
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:19,193
I selected that sari, give it back.

307
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:22,102
Calling me informally?
Beware! I'll cut your tongue.

308
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:24,539
How do you feel?
Come here to buy saris.

309
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:28,509
We're here to buy saris not to
steal the sari you're wearing.

310
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:31,674
If you provoke me again...
keep quiet.

311
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:34,211
She's like a broom,
how dare she talks to me.

312
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:35,616
Your bag is open.

313
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,618
I feel your face is familiar.

314
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:42,216
Me? Actually I'm a director.

315
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:43,157
Must have seen me on TV.

316
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:44,522
Shall I go?

317
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:50,093
You keep quiet, don't talk!
- Brother! Saris kept were missing.

318
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,136
What are you saying?
- I kept saris here.

319
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:54,068
Do we look like sari thieves?

320
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:56,139
That's why I told you
not to visit this shop.

321
00:24:56,262 --> 00:24:57,798
Who wants your sari, take it back.

322
00:24:58,231 --> 00:24:59,642
Come, let's go.

323
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:04,045
For failing to pay one moth's
interest, he derided me for 3 months.

324
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:06,140
Buddy, someone stole
2 saris meanwhile.

325
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:07,377
Is it? He deserves it.

326
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,547
He steals from people like
as interest, he must lose everything.

327
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:14,085
Is it common here?

328
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:17,127
They steal from shops and sell saris
on installments in their neighbourhood.

329
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:21,096
All the customers there are accomplices,
they steal and share the booty.

330
00:25:21,154 --> 00:25:22,258
All are from one gang.

331
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,037
Give me...

332
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:30,400
No, please.

333
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:36,169
I told about sari theft, right?
That's the sari she's having with her.

334
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:40,479
Why are you talking about sari?
Even chocolate she's eating is stolen.

335
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:44,184
Look, he'll not go to court.

336
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:49,215
House, rice mill and land
will be on his name.

337
00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:51,387
How is it possible?
How can I accept this?

338
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:54,124
Don't push too much,
what he says is also right.

339
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:55,130
Agree, brother.

340
00:25:55,188 --> 00:25:56,223
Rice mill be ours...
- How is it possible?

341
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:58,200
I'm talking to him, right?

342
00:25:58,257 --> 00:26:00,294
Keep everything leaving rice mill.

343
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,305
Pay Rs.40 lakhs to my man.

344
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:03,465
He'll pay Rs.30 lakhs.

345
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:04,701
I'll fix the deal.

346
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:07,473
Deal is okay.
Monday registration.

347
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:10,978
Buddy, your men Boosa and Basi
are going overboard.

348
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:14,676
Tell me, if I start repaying,
they'll not be able to bear it.

349
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,180
Have a Beer.
- No, thanks.

350
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:19,985
Don't drink?
- No.

351
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:22,253
He'll have but not Beer.

352
00:26:22,315 --> 00:26:24,591
What's this nonsense?

353
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,652
Forget it, don't get angry.

354
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:29,199
Come, Shivu.
Take it.

355
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:31,257
Why formality between us, brother?

356
00:26:31,324 --> 00:26:33,668
Business is business, take it.

357
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:38,267
We're prospering
because of such fools.

358
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:40,570
How come you're coming
to field work now?

359
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,270
Your father isn't coming out.

360
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:46,512
Poor father!
Got hurt in field work.

361
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:48,108
He's finding difficult to walk also.

362
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:53,089
So, I gave up my job in Bengaluru and
started running full time kangaroo courts.

363
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:56,124
Brother, father told me
to tell you something.

364
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:57,024
What's it?

365
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,687
It seems Shankarappa was here
to meet my father.

366
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:01,129
Your enemies have joined together.

367
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:05,201
It seems they've decided
to bump you off if they have to live.

368
00:27:05,358 --> 00:27:07,531
I don't know if what Shankarappa
said is true or false.

369
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,139
But according to what he says,

370
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:12,640
outside or within your gang,
without your knowledge,

371
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,467
he's laying a trap for you.

372
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:17,205
For safer side, be alert, brother.

373
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:22,082
Keep quiet.
- Get lost, man.

374
00:27:30,116 --> 00:27:34,189
What's this?
Just words no sound at all.

375
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,096
Is it?

376
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:37,724
How experienced grandpa
would be in this!

377
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:39,035
Hands off me.

378
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:41,002
Go, talk to him.

379
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:49,110
...her beauty is...

380
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:50,579
When Arumugha was a kid...

381
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:54,049
First listen to this.

382
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:56,117
When his parents insulted him...

383
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,452
Let him dare say
no after seeing face...

384
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:04,484
I'm telling you important matter,
you're looking elsewhere.

385
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,458
Over?

386
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:09,056
Money is wasted,
no scenes in this film.

387
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:10,964
Is it a film?

388
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,560
How was the German film CD
you watched yesterday?

389
00:28:13,626 --> 00:28:18,974
My body is shudders on thinking
about bathing scene in kitchen.

390
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:21,634
Must watch the film again
and do it again.

391
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:25,575
What's that kitchen scene?

392
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:29,185
No use, everything is in English.
Can I get Kannada language?

393
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:31,050
Whatever the language may be,
sounds are same, right?

394
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:35,124
No need to exchange CD's in public,
keep the CD's secretly in my car.

395
00:28:35,181 --> 00:28:37,092
I'll watch and
keep it secretly in your bike.

396
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:38,526
Okay-
. OKZV-

397
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:40,996
How is it?
- Hands off me.

398
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,000
To become a director,
you've made me a pimp.

399
00:28:44,257 --> 00:28:46,737
Jagadish worked his way to top.

400
00:28:46,993 --> 00:28:51,772
Carrying a basket on head
for long distances...

401
00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:59,515
She's looking at me.

402
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:00,743
Picking up...

403
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:02,042
You're too much.

404
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:05,052
It seems Arumugha was in jail
3 years ago, tell me about that.

405
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:08,490
When Kempamma keeps
the basket down...

406
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:09,651
Millet balls and
country chicken gravy...

407
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:12,628
Did she go to jail with millet balls
and country chicken gravy?

408
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:15,555
It'll be nice to see aunty, right?

409
00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:17,601
Uncle...uncle...
- Whose uncle? Auntie's uncle?

410
00:29:17,657 --> 00:29:18,567
No, my paternal uncle.

411
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:19,602
If he sees me, I'm finished.

412
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:21,695
What are you doing here, Chikka?

413
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:24,166
Bombay Mittai is running
in this theatre, right?

414
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,642
Bombay Mittai?

415
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:30,978
Yesterday's Malayalam CD was great.

416
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:34,607
I've kept the CD in your bike,
if you've any CD, keep it in my jeep.

417
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:36,243
Okay?
- 0kay_

418
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:39,181
What? Malayalam film?

419
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:42,749
You scoundrel!
- Mammootty film.

420
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,087
Hey you!

421
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,220
What?

422
00:30:19,285 --> 00:30:21,458
See if there's any grandma
staring at us!

423
00:30:23,089 --> 00:30:26,468
I don't see anyone there.
Lady sitting there is Kempamma.

424
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:32,600
See this side,
you can see Jagadish here.

425
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:37,547
You can't see, this is known
as hallucination.

426
00:30:37,603 --> 00:30:38,775
Illusion!

427
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:42,713
If you listen to that old man's stories,
those characters will come alive before you.

428
00:30:42,775 --> 00:30:44,777
We'll start living with them.

429
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:46,216
Think over it.

430
00:30:48,147 --> 00:30:51,720
Enough of it, I'll find a solution
for this problem by tomorrow.

431
00:30:52,051 --> 00:30:54,657
Sleep little away from me,
I can't trust you.

432
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,099
Good night.
- Good night.

433
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:03,504
How beautiful Kempamma is! You
feel like staring at her eternally.

434
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,600
Stop your Kempamma's story.

435
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:07,610
I've been asking about Arumugha,
why don't you tell me about him?

436
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:10,670
I'll not say anything about Arumugha.

437
00:31:12,271 --> 00:31:14,444
Take it, close the account.

438
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:16,679
If we come here again here, scold me.
Come.

439
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:20,315
Why any customer to my shop
asks about Arumugha only?

440
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:24,293
Last month also a man came,
he too asked about Arumugha.

441
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,159
I don't know why?

442
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:27,286
Then?

443
00:31:27,353 --> 00:31:29,697
Then, he came to know
he was a reporter.

444
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:31,359
Then?
- What happened then?

445
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:36,532
He tied his hands, doused with petrol
and he burned himself to death.

446
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:37,639
What?

447
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:41,135
Look, they killed him.

448
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,110
They burnt him to death.

449
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:45,649
How did they come to know
he was a reporter?

450
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:47,150
I told them.

451
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:48,651
They finished him.

452
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:49,344
Come, let's go.

453
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:52,150
You wanted to know about Arumugha,
can I tell about him?

454
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:54,714
He's a criminal! Ruthless killers.

455
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,090
Isn't it?
- Buy me a soda.

456
00:31:57,149 --> 00:31:58,389
You want soda?

457
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:00,389
Useless man!

458
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,760
You come every day, drink and go away.

459
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:05,165
Did you ever talk to him?

460
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:06,726
You need brain for it.

461
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:08,237
Wait and see.

462
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:12,202
Take it, boss.
Tandoori chicken.

463
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:15,006
If you drink without eating
it'll damage your liver.

464
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:17,673
My name is Chicken,
I'm having drinks in next table.

465
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:21,309
What's there between us, boss?
We're like friends.

466
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,512
Enjoy!

467
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:26,353
If he eats the chicken,
take it as our job is done.

468
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:27,549
Is he eating?

469
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:31,290
He's eating.
- He must, he must eat!

470
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:34,759
He must come thank me.

471
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,159
He's coming.
- He must come.

472
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:41,633
No problem,
why formality of thanks between us?

473
00:32:41,694 --> 00:32:43,139
Me?

474
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:45,332
What?

475
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:48,469
Can't I buy chicken?
Am I so poor?

476
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:52,072
Not like that, sir.
- Showing off you're rich.- No, sir.

477
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:53,545
Brother!

478
00:32:53,706 --> 00:32:56,346
How much I owe?
- May be Rs.5000, brother.

479
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:59,718
He'll pay it, he must pay it.
- Okay, sir.

480
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:02,725
How dare you buy me chicken!

481
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:07,423
You don't have money to buy,
are you buying it for me?

482
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:10,293
Thank you, boss!

483
00:33:10,356 --> 00:33:11,664
Super buddy!

484
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,502
CD man is also not sincere to you.

485
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:17,106
Watch today!

486
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,607
Greetings, brother.
Are you fine?

487
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,644
You're worse than me, marry first.

488
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:21,609
We will, brother.

489
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:22,643
How was the Korean film?

490
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:25,204
Korean?
Last film was African, right?

491
00:33:25,271 --> 00:33:29,276
I kept CD in your vehicle and
made a gesture like this.

492
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,014
I thought you were saying bye to me.

493
00:33:31,076 --> 00:33:32,680
Couldn't you say it with mouth?

494
00:33:33,112 --> 00:33:34,614
Okay, forget it.
It is in your vehicle, right?

495
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,658
Watch it tomorrow and
tell me your opinion.

496
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:37,125
Would you like to have Samosa?

497
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,354
Give me one.
- Take it.

498
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:39,526
Have it.

499
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,530
It's nice, have it.

500
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:43,691
Oh my God!

501
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:46,161
Was it too spicy?

502
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:47,703
Is this also flop show?

503
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:04,483
Look at his face after getting caught
red handed!

504
00:34:06,078 --> 00:34:07,113
Brother, take fries.

505
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:10,490
Boosa, tell me, what happened?

506
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:13,587
What was the climax scene
of Korean film?

507
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,497
No...

508
00:34:20,993 --> 00:34:24,998
What's this? No salt or no chilly.

509
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,135
What are you looking at? Fry it again.
- I'll do it, brother.

510
00:34:34,173 --> 00:34:35,516
Greetings, brother.

511
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:38,652
It seems you went
out of station last week.

512
00:34:38,711 --> 00:34:41,123
Went to attend a function, brother.

513
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:30,166
Greetings, brother.

514
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,005
Take it.
- Go carefully, brother.

515
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:34,100
Cleaned it just now.

516
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:37,010
You must pay me for using
this stinking toilet.

517
00:35:37,036 --> 00:35:39,573
Brother, use the first toilet,
I've cleaned it just now.

518
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,489
Shivanna, Arumugha is dead.

519
00:36:27,086 --> 00:36:28,121
Hear this!

520
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:34,732
Brother, Arumugha isn't like
earlier times.

521
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:36,404
He has become very weak.

522
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:45,648
Come on, boys!
Carry this bastard!

523
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:01,528
<i>Everything turned topsy-turvy.</i>

524
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:02,529
What to do now?

525
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:05,068
<i>There's a worker Mania
'm Arumughzfs house.</i>

526
00:37:05,124 --> 00:37:07,604
He can't sleep without
visiting street girl.

527
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:08,603
Let's go there.

528
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,664
We can follow him and
see different types of girls.

529
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,973
Why are you disturbing my work?
Go home.

530
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:17,707
Hey monkey, if I don't come to shop...

531
00:37:21,974 --> 00:37:24,147
What are you doing?

532
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:29,318
Look at the girl in that shop,
she's giving me signals.

533
00:37:30,215 --> 00:37:32,252
That sari thief?
- Yes, buddy.

534
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:34,695
Shall I give you a good idea?
Love her.

535
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:37,256
Me? Love that sari thief?

536
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:39,324
I told you to act like you're
in love with her.

537
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:43,271
Do you know one thing?
Her mother cooks for Arumugha's boys.

538
00:37:43,328 --> 00:37:46,434
She has a plan to get her
married to Arumugha.

539
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:52,212
You mean to say, would be?
- No...may be!

540
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:54,012
Arumugha doesn't even look at her.

541
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:56,211
Anyway I'm here to write a story.

542
00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:59,222
If you love her, you can write
a novel not just a story.

543
00:37:59,244 --> 00:38:02,487
If mother and daughter join,
they can narrate 10 film stories.

544
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:03,625
Innocent man!

545
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:06,128
You say wrong but looking back
to ogle at her.

546
00:38:06,185 --> 00:38:08,688
She's above average to look,
what if I really fall in love?

547
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:11,264
You told me we must take
risk in life to succeed.

548
00:38:11,323 --> 00:38:13,462
Risk is not for me, it is for you.

549
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:42,632
You're mine...

550
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:49,264
I'm yours...

551
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:54,209
When I give myself...

552
00:38:54,266 --> 00:38:59,147
Overcoming the hesitation...

553
00:38:59,204 --> 00:39:04,017
I want you...to love and live...

554
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:09,125
I don't want anything else...

555
00:39:09,281 --> 00:39:14,287
Do you create those
romantic scenes in rain?

556
00:39:15,087 --> 00:39:17,294
You wouldn't mistake me
for asking this, right?

557
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,640
You steal things so brazenly,
how do you do it?

558
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:27,407
What? Like this!

559
00:39:57,095 --> 00:40:01,703
ABCDEFGH...

560
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:05,476
Will you teach me, my teacher?

561
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:08,015
Tell me, what's the fee you charge?

562
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:13,623
Diploma in love...
Different exercises...

563
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:23,097
You've done all that,
you're my master...my fighter...

564
00:40:23,155 --> 00:40:30,471
It's like putting hot vada in mouth...
and asking me to eat it...

565
00:40:30,529 --> 00:40:36,138
Don't kill me with looks,
save me with your kisses...

566
00:41:23,482 --> 00:41:32,197
I'll praise you learning
the X Y and Z...

567
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:34,396
I will love you...

568
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:40,068
Mouthing dialogues...
Camera in eyes...

569
00:41:40,132 --> 00:41:46,708
Are you directing?
Film is a silverjubilee hit...

570
00:41:46,772 --> 00:41:51,653
Your role is supporting cast...

571
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:57,160
I'm close to you getting attracted...

572
00:41:57,215 --> 00:42:01,755
Are you female mercy for my life?

573
00:42:26,178 --> 00:42:28,124
Bloody rascal is not answering call.

574
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,158
May be got the news.

575
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:31,558
He would've talked
bravely if he hadn't.

576
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:34,694
This is Tamil Nadu, right?
- I'm sure it is Deeva.

577
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:38,291
Who sent you? Answer me.

578
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:39,630
I'll not tell even if you kill me.

579
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:42,297
How dare! Look at his courage
5 minutes before death.

580
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,362
Move away.

581
00:42:44,796 --> 00:42:48,141
Praveen or Deeva, who sent you?

582
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:51,636
You're eating well after long time,
shall I serve one more idly?

583
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,240
You've decided to kill me.

584
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:56,650
I don't have time to inquire this.
- One more idly?

585
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:01,316
If I know who that is...

586
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:02,585
Okay, have another idly.

587
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:05,719
I'm talking to him, right?

588
00:43:05,784 --> 00:43:08,094
You're killing me with your idlies.

589
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:10,099
Is it paining you to eat hot idlies?

590
00:43:10,155 --> 00:43:12,999
Anyone of you want idly?
- No, please.

591
00:43:13,158 --> 00:43:14,501
Stuff his mouth with idlies.

592
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,596
Why feed biscuits to a dying dog?

593
00:43:16,661 --> 00:43:19,005
I'm serving him hot idlies
and he's shouting at me.

594
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:22,500
One among them has
decided to kill me.

595
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:24,274
You're not coming out.

596
00:43:24,336 --> 00:43:26,646
What if I kill them all?

597
00:43:26,705 --> 00:43:28,150
I'll not have any more headaches.

598
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:30,685
You'll get sense only after death.

599
00:43:30,709 --> 00:43:33,087
I'll tell you the truth,
what will you do for me?

600
00:43:33,145 --> 00:43:35,091
<i>GEE-Sag his mouth'.!</i>

601
00:43:35,147 --> 00:43:37,024
It seems he'll talk, take this.
Gag him.

602
00:43:37,082 --> 00:43:39,221
Arumugha, listen to me...

603
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:41,628
Shut your mouth.

604
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:46,566
I've been asking you since morning,
you refused till now.

605
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:48,627
Now if you want to talk,
should I listen to you?

606
00:43:48,693 --> 00:43:51,537
We must do something with him.

607
00:43:52,697 --> 00:43:54,699
Die man!

608
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:57,178
I'll find who was behind you.

609
00:43:57,402 --> 00:43:59,040
Boy, finish him.

610
00:43:59,104 --> 00:44:01,141
Brother! I'll do it.

611
00:44:02,107 --> 00:44:05,145
What's this shirt?
Colourful like a Gypsy.

612
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:06,746
You need a label for it also.

613
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:09,189
I've been running only errands
for 2 years now.

614
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:11,659
If I do something like this,
I too can wear a label, brother.

615
00:44:11,683 --> 00:44:13,094
No comedy please!

616
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:17,199
I'm also running only errands
for 4 years now.

617
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:21,226
If you're doing it for 4 years,
should I also do it?

618
00:44:21,293 --> 00:44:25,002
Brother, please I'll do it.
- Brother, I'll do it...

619
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:25,599
Get out.

620
00:44:25,664 --> 00:44:29,476
Please brother...please brother...

621
00:44:32,537 --> 00:44:34,574
Why did you do like this, brother?

622
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:37,176
Why are you fighting like
kids in carnival?

623
00:44:37,242 --> 00:44:38,619
Clear it off.

624
00:44:38,677 --> 00:44:41,283
<i>Li“. it.
- Lifl it.</i>

625
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:43,189
Neither you did nor I did it,
are you happy now?

626
00:44:43,248 --> 00:44:45,592
Police...police...
take the body inside.

627
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:48,062
What to do now, brother?

628
00:44:49,688 --> 00:44:50,632
Greetings, sir.

629
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:53,431
What happened to my case, sir?
- I'll take care of it.

630
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:54,765
Greetings, sir.

631
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:57,165
What? Did you spill sambar?

632
00:44:57,228 --> 00:44:58,434
Come in, Inspector.

633
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,703
Come sir.
- Come. Please take your seat.

634
00:45:00,765 --> 00:45:04,645
Have you caught the man who
came to practice shooting?

635
00:45:04,703 --> 00:45:06,683
It wasn't for me,
it was for someone else.

636
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:10,709
He came to kill some drunkard, I
was there at the same time by chance.

637
00:45:10,976 --> 00:45:11,579
That's all.

638
00:45:11,643 --> 00:45:13,452
One more important matter.

639
00:45:13,512 --> 00:45:17,983
There's a request from Bangalore
Commissioner's office to fax your case files.

640
00:45:18,016 --> 00:45:20,622
I don't know the matter,
it could be for encounter also.

641
00:45:20,685 --> 00:45:21,993
Be alert.

642
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:25,001
If it is encounter,
without your knowledge.

643
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:27,593
They'll keep a watch on you
in your area,

644
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:30,401
if I get any information,
I'll pass it on to you.

645
00:45:30,462 --> 00:45:34,137
For safer side, be careful.
Okay? I'll go now.

646
00:45:34,733 --> 00:45:36,269
Greetings, sir.

647
00:45:37,536 --> 00:45:39,607
Don't you've sense?
Will you leave the body like that?

648
00:45:39,671 --> 00:45:43,778
Am I here to hold the body?
Can't you hold it properly?

649
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:48,217
What's this, director?
You've become very busy.

650
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,352
Our plan has started bearing results.

651
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:54,192
I've got little trickle of
information on Arumugha.

652
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:58,200
I'll make a film on Arumugha,
then I'll make her my life's heroine.

653
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:00,293
Have you gone mad?

654
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:02,634
If you show your womanizer
trait to her,

655
00:46:02,694 --> 00:46:05,038
I'll have to put a sweetmeat shop
for you next to my bangle shop.

656
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:08,077
You pushed me to love her, right?

657
00:46:08,133 --> 00:46:12,479
I'm really falling in love with her.
- For that? Pack bags and leave the place.

658
00:46:12,671 --> 00:46:14,708
Not tomorrow, leave right now.

659
00:46:14,973 --> 00:46:17,681
I was trying to help as a friend,
are you planning to ruin my life?

660
00:46:17,976 --> 00:46:19,580
Okay, don't shout.

661
00:46:20,044 --> 00:46:21,717
Show me Arumugha's house
before I leave.

662
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,982
I'll go away after seeing it.
But don't say no.

663
00:46:24,049 --> 00:46:25,323
No.

664
00:46:25,383 --> 00:46:29,160
I don't know why I'm scared to see them.
- Take their photos.

665
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:34,169
Take their photos? If they get doubt,
our photos will be garlanded.

666
00:46:35,326 --> 00:46:37,772
Why didn't you tell me
it is dead end?

667
00:46:38,997 --> 00:46:41,603
Buddy, he's looking at me,
I'm dead today.

668
00:46:42,067 --> 00:46:43,774
Okay, stay cool.

669
00:46:44,002 --> 00:46:45,447
I'll turn the bike casually.

670
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,676
If he asks anything,
I'll talk to him.

671
00:46:54,679 --> 00:46:56,488
Hey, stop the bike.

672
00:46:56,548 --> 00:46:58,528
What's up?
- Who are you guys?

673
00:46:58,616 --> 00:47:03,031
I'm Rahul from...
- Tell me clearly.

674
00:47:03,054 --> 00:47:04,124
What are you doing here?

675
00:47:04,189 --> 00:47:06,226
Came to meet a friend.
- Who is he?

676
00:47:06,291 --> 00:47:07,463
Ram...
- Lakshman.

677
00:47:07,525 --> 00:47:08,299
Ram Lakshman.

678
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:12,069
I'm Ravana!
What are you doing here at this hour?

679
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:12,972
Tell me the address.

680
00:47:13,031 --> 00:47:14,567
Sir...left...
- Right.

681
00:47:14,632 --> 00:47:15,633
First right and then left.

682
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,146
You're bangle shop owner's son, right?

683
00:47:18,203 --> 00:47:19,079
Yes, brother.

684
00:47:19,137 --> 00:47:20,377
You mustn't come here at this hour.

685
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:23,078
Get going...English too...
- Let's go, buddy.

686
00:47:23,141 --> 00:47:24,279
Go away!

687
00:47:26,144 --> 00:47:28,283
What's that?
- Some fools!

688
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:31,088
They lost way and came here.
I warned and sent them away.

689
00:47:31,149 --> 00:47:33,755
I met them inn bar,
I too gave them a thrashing.

690
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:35,987
I lost my honour in home
because of them.

691
00:47:36,054 --> 00:47:37,431
Are they watching us?

692
00:47:37,489 --> 00:47:39,491
Boys don't look like that, brother.

693
00:47:39,591 --> 00:47:41,264
One of them is bangle
shop owner's son.

694
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:45,066
SI told us to be careful.
Can't believe anyone.

695
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:47,701
Keep an eye on them.
- I'll take care of them, brother.

696
00:47:47,766 --> 00:47:52,237
Watch them carefully, if you
get any doubt, let's finish them.

697
00:47:55,707 --> 00:47:58,187
Who switched on TV early morning?

698
00:48:11,189 --> 00:48:13,226
Father and mother have gone
to Bombay to visit daughter.

699
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:14,599
Sent wife to her parents' home.

700
00:48:14,659 --> 00:48:18,072
Are you enjoying life with him?
- No, sir.

701
00:48:18,129 --> 00:48:22,168
Sir watches blue films in theatre.
At night drinks and food.

702
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,644
Are you here to enjoy life?

703
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:27,080
No sir, I'm visual
communication student.

704
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:29,618
I'm here to make a documentary
film on this place.

705
00:48:29,674 --> 00:48:33,417
That's why I took these photos.
- Photo? Show me.

706
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:39,355
I wanted to roam around with friend for
10 days and start work from tomorrow.

707
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,761
Not satisfied, let's go, come.

708
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:45,157
I'm here only, I've little work,
I'll finish and come.

709
00:48:45,223 --> 00:48:46,361
Everything is over.

710
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:49,405
They'll kill me before
I see my child's face.

711
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:52,168
I warned you so many times,
you never listened to me.

712
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:56,007
My wife wanted another child also.

713
00:48:56,267 --> 00:49:00,181
Are you taking my photo also?
Is this your project?

714
00:49:00,238 --> 00:49:01,148
Take out the reel.

715
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:03,685
You were standing there stylishly,
so I took a photo.

716
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:07,019
Are you getting smart with me?
Take out the reel.

717
00:49:07,078 --> 00:49:07,647
Trust me, sir.

718
00:49:07,946 --> 00:49:09,550
You were standing like a hero,
so I...

719
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:12,595
If I punch your face and camera
will break into pieces.

720
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:13,526
Take out the reel.

721
00:49:13,585 --> 00:49:15,690
No reel, sir, this is digital camera.
Take a look.

722
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:17,490
How can I see it?

723
00:49:17,555 --> 00:49:19,967
Shouldn't it be developed?
Am I so foolish?

724
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:22,661
No need to develop,
this is digital, take a look.

725
00:49:25,096 --> 00:49:28,134
You should've told me,
I would've put on glasses.

726
00:49:28,366 --> 00:49:30,573
Will you take another snap?

727
00:49:34,072 --> 00:49:35,415
Lovely action!

728
00:49:40,545 --> 00:49:42,320
You're a great artiste!

729
00:49:42,414 --> 00:49:45,088
I've never seen myself so good.

730
00:49:45,116 --> 00:49:46,595
You've touched my heart, boss.

731
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:48,995
You look like a mass goon.

732
00:49:49,187 --> 00:49:51,258
I'm doing all this to become
a terrorizing goon.

733
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:54,326
How did Arumugha reach the
place where he's now?

734
00:49:54,392 --> 00:49:56,167
Do you know anything about his story?

735
00:49:57,395 --> 00:49:59,602
Know about Arumugha brother?

736
00:50:01,132 --> 00:50:05,103
Should I tell you about brother Arumugha?
- No.

737
00:50:05,403 --> 00:50:11,012
Boss! Ask me anything, I'll tell you.

738
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,264
Hello!

739
00:50:30,294 --> 00:50:31,773
Cheers!

740
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:39,147
Greetings, boss.
- Greetings.

741
00:50:39,204 --> 00:50:40,080
Say Hi to uncle.

742
00:50:40,138 --> 00:50:41,116
Hello girl!

743
00:50:41,172 --> 00:50:42,150
Shall I go now, boss?
- Okay.

744
00:50:42,207 --> 00:50:42,810
Say bye to uncle.

745
00:50:43,307 --> 00:50:45,218
Put some foreign location, please.

746
00:50:45,276 --> 00:50:48,189
Like America, London, Goa, Bombay...
- What's the name?

747
00:50:48,246 --> 00:50:50,226
Ganga, my daughter's name is Ramya.

748
00:50:50,281 --> 00:50:52,761
Love marriage?
- Yes, sir.

749
00:50:52,817 --> 00:50:54,819
Don't feel shy.

750
00:50:55,286 --> 00:50:56,390
Then...

751
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:58,625
Greetings, brother.

752
00:50:59,057 --> 00:51:00,468
No, I'm very near, brother.

753
00:51:00,692 --> 00:51:02,694
Okay, I'll be there right now,
brother. Okay.

754
00:51:03,094 --> 00:51:05,165
Who is it?
- Arumugha brother.

755
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:07,540
Brother has called me personally
on phone.

756
00:51:07,665 --> 00:51:08,268
What's the matter?

757
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:10,279
There's some big deal happening today.

758
00:51:10,635 --> 00:51:12,273
What?
- I don't know.

759
00:51:12,336 --> 00:51:13,576
I'll know only if I go there.

760
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:16,312
But one thing is sure,
some big head is going to roll down.

761
00:51:16,374 --> 00:51:19,514
Earlier I wasn't called for big deals.

762
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:24,686
Recently I went little overboard right
before brother, this is the result of it.

763
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:26,660
Okay, wait for 5 minutes,
I'll come back.

764
00:51:28,186 --> 00:51:30,029
There was a box in my bag,
where is it, Chikka?

765
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:32,227
There's a bureau in the room, right?
I've kept it inside that.

766
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:33,360
Why?

767
00:51:34,025 --> 00:51:39,031
My uncle was a reporter in Bengaluru,
he gave me this spy mic for my personal use.

768
00:51:39,097 --> 00:51:40,235
Audio transmitter.

769
00:51:40,298 --> 00:51:44,144
A device to listen to conversations
without anyone's knowledge.

770
00:51:44,202 --> 00:51:49,311
If we fix this, we can hear their
conversation clearly through a receiver.

771
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:53,789
Not only that it can receive the
signal clearly within a kilometer.

772
00:51:54,045 --> 00:51:56,582
Why are you talking so much like
a sales girl in Teleshopping TV?

773
00:51:56,648 --> 00:51:58,594
What will you do with it?

774
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,006
My photo in this!
Can we see photos in this?

775
00:52:21,072 --> 00:52:24,485
You can see photos,
listen to songs, watch films.

776
00:52:24,542 --> 00:52:27,250
You said you wanted to
show photos to your wife, right?

777
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:28,289
Yes, sir.

778
00:52:28,346 --> 00:52:31,259
Take it for tonight, show her and
return it tomorrow.

779
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:32,623
Thanks, sir.

780
00:52:32,683 --> 00:52:34,629
But you must return it tomorrow.

781
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:36,654
I'm perfect in keeping promises, sir.

782
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,124
Greetings, brother.
- Come.

783
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:12,725
What's the matter? Brother himself
called on phone to come urgently.

784
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:16,233
You were itching to go on
a deal like a kid, right?

785
00:53:16,494 --> 00:53:17,598
Watch it today.

786
00:53:17,662 --> 00:53:20,108
To watch? I came running
expecting something else.

787
00:53:20,164 --> 00:53:21,006
Who?

788
00:53:21,065 --> 00:53:23,568
Deeva.
- Deeva?

789
00:53:23,635 --> 00:53:24,375
Yes.

790
00:53:24,435 --> 00:53:27,473
Who is Deeva?
- Big don!

791
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:30,178
Arumugha and he are at loggerheads.

792
00:53:31,743 --> 00:53:34,656
They planned to kill Arumugha,
we finished Balan.

793
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:36,692
Praveen fell at feet
and saved his life.

794
00:53:36,747 --> 00:53:41,628
Only Deeva is remaining.
This plan for him.

795
00:53:42,753 --> 00:53:44,596
He's always surrounded by boys, right?

796
00:53:44,655 --> 00:53:46,396
Moreover he's into politics also.

797
00:53:46,457 --> 00:53:49,631
He has a concubine in
Ashok Nagar second cross.

798
00:53:49,694 --> 00:53:52,573
Every Friday he spends
the night there.

799
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,541
Do you know where Ashok Nagar is?
- I know.

800
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,044
Today is Friday!

801
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:59,240
If Deeva goes there,
phones of his boys are switched off.

802
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:02,251
Our boys are watching the house.

803
00:54:02,307 --> 00:54:03,251
Then?

804
00:54:03,307 --> 00:54:06,720
Basi will go around the place on bike.

805
00:54:07,044 --> 00:54:09,149
He'll deflate the car tyre.

806
00:54:09,213 --> 00:54:13,184
Other boys will lock the
back door and wait there.

807
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:15,993
Ashok Nagar is quite large.

808
00:54:16,053 --> 00:54:21,162
My friend lives in 6th cross.
Let's go and sit on his terrace.

809
00:54:21,225 --> 00:54:23,603
No...no...if we go now,
we'll not get signal.

810
00:54:23,661 --> 00:54:28,167
We'll not know the next plan,
let's go after they leave.

811
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:31,042
What's the time?
- 12.30 am.

812
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:33,104
Go to petrol station and
fill diesel in car.

813
00:54:33,171 --> 00:54:35,708
He's going to petrol bunk.
- Leis follow him, start bike.

814
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,718
Come.

815
00:55:10,107 --> 00:55:11,484
Hello!
- Hello!

816
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:14,455
Deeva brother, they're planning to kill you.
- What?

817
00:55:14,512 --> 00:55:16,321
He's talking to Deeva.

818
00:55:16,414 --> 00:55:18,087
We'll be there in 30 minutes.

819
00:55:18,182 --> 00:55:20,184
What are you blabbering?
- I swear, brother.

820
00:55:20,251 --> 00:55:22,595
You're in Ashok Nagar, right?
- Yes.

821
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:26,432
There's a car in the street corner,
3 people are sitting inside, check.

822
00:55:30,027 --> 00:55:31,062
I can see the car.

823
00:55:31,129 --> 00:55:33,234
Check your car, the tyre will be flat.

824
00:55:34,298 --> 00:55:36,642
He's telling him the entire plan.

825
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,203
Boys are waiting inside the car
locking the rear door.

826
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:40,214
Perfect plan, brother.

827
00:55:40,271 --> 00:55:42,217
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

828
00:55:42,273 --> 00:55:44,150
Forgive me, brother,
I came to know the plan just now.

829
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:46,017
Escape from there somehow, brother.

830
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:47,351
Sundara is playing double game.

831
00:55:47,411 --> 00:55:52,224
I thought Sundara is naive but
he's planning to finish Arumugha.

832
00:55:52,283 --> 00:55:54,388
Keep TV and other lights on.

833
00:55:54,452 --> 00:55:56,591
They must believe
you're still in house.

834
00:55:56,654 --> 00:55:59,328
Don't try to contact your boys,
brother.

835
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,664
No time for that.

836
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:03,069
Do something and escape from there.

837
00:56:03,094 --> 00:56:05,096
Fantastic twist in the story.

838
00:56:05,162 --> 00:56:07,073
Car is moving, go...

839
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,237
This is the interval
block for my film.

840
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:32,192
Yes, brother, not police jeep
but ambulance.

841
00:56:32,256 --> 00:56:33,599
Deeva is still in house.

842
00:56:33,658 --> 00:56:35,103
You can come, brother.

843
00:56:37,228 --> 00:56:39,003
Come, Chikka.

844
00:56:45,035 --> 00:56:47,606
Can you hear? Can you hear it?

845
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:53,020
Where's he?
- He'll be in first floor. Break it open.

846
00:56:54,478 --> 00:56:57,459
Come in boys...
search...everywhere.

847
00:56:57,515 --> 00:56:58,619
Come with me.

848
00:56:58,683 --> 00:57:00,185
Arumugha has arrived!

849
00:57:02,453 --> 00:57:05,024
Search everywhere,
don't leave any place.

850
00:57:05,056 --> 00:57:06,091
Not there, brother?

851
00:57:06,157 --> 00:57:07,465
Okay, let's check this room.

852
00:57:07,725 --> 00:57:09,398
Check up there.

853
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:10,962
No...no...check upstairs.

854
00:57:11,028 --> 00:57:12,006
I checked upstairs, brother.

855
00:57:12,063 --> 00:57:13,474
Come quickly.
- Search this side.

856
00:57:19,236 --> 00:57:20,237
Not here.

857
00:57:24,475 --> 00:57:26,455
That rascal managed to escape.

858
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:27,580
Deeva managed to escape.

859
00:57:27,645 --> 00:57:28,988
What were you doing here then?

860
00:57:29,046 --> 00:57:31,083
We were alert,
nobody came out of the house.

861
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:33,992
An ambulance went, right?
Where did it go from?

862
00:57:34,051 --> 00:57:37,498
It came out from fourth house.
It was an emergency, brother.

863
00:57:37,555 --> 00:57:39,535
He escaped in ambulance.

864
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:42,537
If he managed to escape from Arumugha,
he's really smart.

865
00:57:42,593 --> 00:57:46,598
Deeva managed to escape
under your watchful eyes.

866
00:57:46,764 --> 00:57:49,142
That too in an ambulance.

867
00:57:52,503 --> 00:57:54,608
Why is he laughing now?
- How would I know?

868
00:57:54,672 --> 00:57:57,278
Deeva is very smart!

869
00:57:57,708 --> 00:58:00,245
Isn't he, Sundara?

870
00:58:02,113 --> 00:58:06,061
Brother, he would be going in
ambulance, we can chase and catch him.

871
00:58:06,217 --> 00:58:07,696
He has been caught.

872
00:58:08,185 --> 00:58:12,565
The plan wasn't for Deeva,
it was for you, Sundara.

873
00:58:14,592 --> 00:58:16,503
Is Deeva brilliant?

874
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,063
Arumugha is super smart!
Super plan!

875
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:21,576
Poor man Sundara is caught.

876
00:58:21,632 --> 00:58:23,509
Don't know what would
they do with him?

877
00:58:23,567 --> 00:58:26,309
Urgency in everything, sunny.

878
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:30,580
Before sprouting,
you wanted to become a tree.

879
00:58:30,641 --> 00:58:39,584
When you were called unnecessarily
and told every move in the plan,

880
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:41,696
you should've understood.

881
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:45,193
Bloody rascal, always were itching
to do it, planning to bump us all?

882
00:58:45,256 --> 00:58:46,530
<i>GO: R.</i>

883
00:58:46,624 --> 00:58:48,729
I agree I told Deeva about your plan.

884
00:58:48,993 --> 00:58:51,064
I didn't tell him anything else,
brother. Trust me, brother.

885
00:58:51,128 --> 00:58:54,598
You're hero to me, brother.
I joined for you, brother.

886
00:58:54,665 --> 00:59:00,013
I'm not a hero...villain!
- I accept I called you here.

887
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,016
I don't have any other plan, brother.

888
00:59:02,073 --> 00:59:03,108
Please trust me, brother.

889
00:59:03,174 --> 00:59:06,553
Never made any mistake, this is
the first, please forgive me, brother.

890
00:59:06,611 --> 00:59:13,961
Please forgive me once, brother.
I made a mistake.

891
00:59:14,018 --> 00:59:18,330
Basi brother!

892
00:59:34,004 --> 00:59:36,575
They shot dead Sundara!

893
00:59:40,311 --> 00:59:42,154
Killed him!

894
00:59:46,617 --> 00:59:48,995
Leave me...leave me...

895
00:59:50,654 --> 00:59:53,760
At last he got caught, bloody rascal.

896
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,004
What's up, Deeva?

897
00:59:59,997 --> 01:00:00,634
Deeva!

898
01:00:00,698 --> 01:00:04,612
You're surviving watching good scenes.

899
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:08,515
You beautiful...l beautiful...

900
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,715
I didn't send him to you
with any plan to kill you.

901
01:00:14,011 --> 01:00:16,389
I left him with you for my safety,
that's all.

902
01:00:16,447 --> 01:00:18,518
I was quiet when
you killed my brother.

903
01:00:18,682 --> 01:00:21,060
Leave me...leave me...

904
01:00:32,096 --> 01:00:35,737
Do we need all this? Let's go.

905
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:40,715
If anyone double crosses me...

906
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:43,049
This will be the result.

907
01:00:43,107 --> 01:00:45,781
What's that?
- I don't know, brother.

908
01:00:46,043 --> 01:00:48,045
MP3 player, brother.

909
01:00:48,112 --> 01:00:50,456
Come, let's go.
- May be to listen to songs.

910
01:00:50,514 --> 01:00:53,051
Throw them in my farm.

911
01:00:55,286 --> 01:00:57,095
Brother, there's a mic on it.

912
01:00:57,154 --> 01:01:01,159
Someone is listening to
our conversation, brother.

913
01:01:01,592 --> 01:01:03,230
Who else it could be? Deeva only.

914
01:01:03,294 --> 01:01:04,272
Bastard!

915
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:06,808
I don't think he did it.

916
01:01:07,064 --> 01:01:10,102
If it was him, he wouldn't have
waited for Sundara's phone call.

917
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:13,444
He would've escaped
when you told the plan to Sundara.

918
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:17,179
Someone nearby is listening
our conversation.

919
01:01:18,142 --> 01:01:22,181
I'm finished today.
I told you not to do this.

920
01:01:22,246 --> 01:01:23,725
What to do now?

921
01:01:23,781 --> 01:01:25,260
Come...

922
01:01:26,217 --> 01:01:30,461
The man listening to this on
the other side.

923
01:01:30,521 --> 01:01:33,024
Whosoever you may be!

924
01:01:33,257 --> 01:01:36,500
However big man you may be!

925
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:40,167
You will die in one hour!

926
01:01:41,732 --> 01:01:47,182
I'll kill you with my own hands.

927
01:01:49,473 --> 01:01:51,612
Come...let's go...

928
01:01:52,176 --> 01:01:53,519
Go...go...

929
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:07,433
Come fast, Chikka.
Please listen to me.

930
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:09,027
They wouldn't suspect us,

931
01:02:09,093 --> 01:02:12,097
I'm sure they would suspect Pradeep
and would go for him.

932
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:18,441
Let's escape tonight itself, come.
Listen to me.

933
01:02:18,469 --> 01:02:21,109
You will go away.
Where can I go?

934
01:02:21,171 --> 01:02:24,209
They'll kill me before I see the
face of my child.

935
01:02:24,275 --> 01:02:26,585
Nothing will happen, come with me.

936
01:02:26,644 --> 01:02:28,214
Get up.
Come.

937
01:02:28,278 --> 01:02:29,586
I'm scared.

938
01:02:29,647 --> 01:02:32,184
Nothing will happen, come.
Come.

939
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:46,134
Leave them, boys!

940
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:49,467
Arumugha, they're not opening up
though thrashed brutally.

941
01:03:49,893 --> 01:03:51,964
Why all this? Let's finish them.

942
01:03:52,529 --> 01:03:54,031
They're here to snoop on us.

943
01:03:54,097 --> 01:03:56,907
But we must know if they're
police or some other.

944
01:03:56,967 --> 01:03:57,945
Police, brother.

945
01:03:58,001 --> 01:04:00,208
You said SI had warned you recently.
- No.

946
01:04:00,437 --> 01:04:02,474
They're keeping this file too.
See this.

947
01:04:03,874 --> 01:04:06,946
They've used mic to trap,
I'm sure they're police, brother.

948
01:04:07,011 --> 01:04:10,720
Why are you still thinking, brother?
Why not finish them quickly?

949
01:04:10,781 --> 01:04:13,489
Getting late, I've to take
father to hospital.

950
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:17,088
Then, you go.
- Okay, I'll go.

951
01:04:18,455 --> 01:04:19,593
Come.

952
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:24,598
Buddy, they talk about finishing
like we're a plate of food.

953
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:25,935
Tell them the truth, buddy.

954
01:04:25,996 --> 01:04:27,907
If I tell them the truth,
they'll shoot us to death.

955
01:04:27,931 --> 01:04:30,639
Would they get us biryani now?

956
01:04:31,535 --> 01:04:32,878
Will you show us film?

957
01:04:32,936 --> 01:04:35,143
Bloody rascal!

958
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:45,117
Okay, finish them.

959
01:04:47,451 --> 01:04:49,931
I'm not police,
I'm here to write a story, sir.

960
01:04:49,987 --> 01:04:51,796
What story?

961
01:04:52,689 --> 01:04:54,430
I'm a film director.

962
01:04:56,026 --> 01:05:01,704
I'm a director, producer wanted
a story, that's why I came here, sir.

963
01:05:10,641 --> 01:05:11,176
What did you say?

964
01:05:11,441 --> 01:05:13,045
I came here to write a story
about you, sir.

965
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:13,952
Story means?

966
01:05:14,044 --> 01:05:17,582
Is it like Crime Story and
Warrant on TV?

967
01:05:17,648 --> 01:05:18,820
Not like that, sir.

968
01:05:18,882 --> 01:05:22,591
Like Om and Kariya films, sir.

969
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:42,675
How to believe you?

970
01:05:44,875 --> 01:05:46,445
Brother, tea.

971
01:05:50,414 --> 01:05:51,051
Nice!

972
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:53,424
But film got over before
I finished my tea.

973
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:54,428
Short film, sir.

974
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:56,624
But I'm making full length
feature film on you, sir.

975
01:05:56,853 --> 01:05:58,958
Feature film?

976
01:05:59,156 --> 01:06:03,627
You should've told me this before,
look, how brutally they've hit you.

977
01:06:03,694 --> 01:06:04,729
Do you need this?

978
01:06:04,795 --> 01:06:07,833
Fearing they'll kill me if they know
I'm writing about you...

979
01:06:07,898 --> 01:06:09,900
He was a reporter,
he writes only truth.

980
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:12,208
Very dangerous man.
But you? You're a director.

981
01:06:12,436 --> 01:06:15,542
Moreover you're making film on me.
<i>It'll</i> be jolly.

982
01:06:15,606 --> 01:06:17,552
To watch my film in theatre.

983
01:06:17,741 --> 01:06:19,220
What do you say, boys?
- Yes, will be very good, brother.

984
01:06:19,443 --> 01:06:20,080
Come.

985
01:06:20,811 --> 01:06:23,917
Ask me whatever you want.

986
01:06:24,181 --> 01:06:25,558
This is our film.

987
01:06:25,616 --> 01:06:28,153
Film on my life.

988
01:06:28,385 --> 01:06:30,991
Come on, boys!
Come.

989
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:34,425
Start, brother.

990
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:35,459
One minute.

991
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:41,476
No need of that, be natural.
- No need?

992
01:06:42,432 --> 01:06:43,035
Okay.

993
01:06:43,567 --> 01:06:44,443
Rolling!

994
01:06:48,105 --> 01:06:50,517
Basi, you say.
- I can't.

995
01:06:50,941 --> 01:06:52,921
You watch lot of films, right?
You say, Boosa.

996
01:06:52,976 --> 01:06:53,920
I can't.

997
01:06:53,977 --> 01:06:57,083
If you're scared of camera,
shall I give you recorder?

998
01:06:57,147 --> 01:07:00,685
No problem, first time, right?
That's why.

999
01:07:01,818 --> 01:07:06,198
You're a VIP now,
where did you start this journey?

1000
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:08,799
How did it start?
- In school!

1001
01:07:09,126 --> 01:07:10,935
Undressing of Draupadi.

1002
01:07:11,428 --> 01:07:12,702
I was playing Draupadi.

1003
01:07:12,863 --> 01:07:17,869
When Dussasana was removing the sari,
Krishna failed to give the sari at right time.

1004
01:07:17,935 --> 01:07:20,176
So I was standing on stage
with my brief.

1005
01:07:20,437 --> 01:07:22,883
Actors playing Kauravas laughed at me.

1006
01:07:24,074 --> 01:07:28,648
If anyone laughs at me,
I just can't tolerate it.

1007
01:07:28,712 --> 01:07:31,955
The fire in my heart was lit
on that day!

1008
01:07:32,015 --> 01:07:35,656
When people move aside fearing you!

1009
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:40,734
It's a different type of intoxication.

1010
01:07:40,791 --> 01:07:42,395
It started from that day,

1011
01:07:42,459 --> 01:07:45,838
thrashed anyone who laughed
or talked about me,

1012
01:07:45,896 --> 01:07:48,968
fights in school, college
and in neighbourhood.

1013
01:07:49,032 --> 01:07:53,139
For one-upmanship, people
used to beat others for domination,

1014
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:55,144
I used to thrash both
to dominate them.

1015
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:58,943
I used to fight so much that
I was full time busy in it.

1016
01:07:59,042 --> 01:08:01,454
Didn't get time to sleep also.

1017
01:08:01,512 --> 01:08:04,618
It would be fun till certain age.

1018
01:08:04,848 --> 01:08:08,694
Do you know the main reason
for boys turning into hooligans?

1019
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:09,730
Love!

1020
01:08:10,721 --> 01:08:13,133
Do you know why we all are
like this today?

1021
01:08:13,657 --> 01:08:15,466
This man's love story.

1022
01:08:15,626 --> 01:08:21,577
While we were in college, dating girls
in neighbour area was like going to war.

1023
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:25,076
One day when Basi went to meet
his girl friend in her area.

1024
01:08:25,135 --> 01:08:27,012
Her brother saw him.

1025
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:28,515
Who is he?

1026
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,485
Who are you?

1027
01:08:33,977 --> 01:08:35,718
Why are you here?

1028
01:08:35,879 --> 01:08:40,589
He came here to meet your sister, I'm
here to beat anyone who objects this.

1029
01:08:47,591 --> 01:08:53,132
Then came that area's goon Jagga,
I had never seen him before.

1030
01:08:53,397 --> 01:08:54,671
Brother, Rudrapura boys.

1031
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:56,504
Boys from Rudrapura?
- Yes.

1032
01:08:56,566 --> 01:08:58,443
Aren't there girls in your area?

1033
01:08:58,502 --> 01:09:03,474
There are girls in my area, it
seems there are no men in your area.

1034
01:09:13,684 --> 01:09:17,655
My name reached the ears of
top goons after I attacked Jagga.

1035
01:09:17,721 --> 01:09:19,428
Police brokered a compromise
between us.

1036
01:09:19,456 --> 01:09:24,462
But I made a scar on his face, he'll think
of me whenever he sees his face in mirror.

1037
01:09:24,528 --> 01:09:28,977
Are you Arumugha?
Are you great goon?

1038
01:09:29,132 --> 01:09:33,808
If I hear that you've
done this or that.

1039
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:36,680
Bloody! You'll die in my hands.

1040
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:38,686
My death in your hands!

1041
01:09:38,742 --> 01:09:39,880
Come.

1042
01:09:42,412 --> 01:09:43,982
I hacked him to death.

1043
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:50,460
That was my first entry.

1044
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:54,429
In this business of violence,
one who kills gets the throne,

1045
01:09:54,491 --> 01:09:56,971
we're famous goon
only if we kill famous goon.

1046
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:01,609
Where I killed, whom I killed
and how many I killed...

1047
01:10:01,732 --> 01:10:04,008
Value and respect depends on it.

1048
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:06,605
Every murder is like a medal.

1049
01:10:07,671 --> 01:10:09,480
What's that?

1050
01:10:09,606 --> 01:10:10,744
OWmpics!

1051
01:10:10,807 --> 01:10:12,718
Like Olympics.

1052
01:10:13,076 --> 01:10:14,646
How many till date?

1053
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:19,421
18 by you alone...all
of us together...

1054
01:10:19,516 --> 01:10:20,517
40.
- Mine is 4.

1055
01:10:20,584 --> 01:10:21,494
Total 48.

1056
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:23,428
48!

1057
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:26,764
Had I killed you both,
I would've hit 50.

1058
01:10:27,457 --> 01:10:31,735
I would've raised machete
like Sachin raises his bat.

1059
01:10:34,765 --> 01:10:35,505
What happened after that?

1060
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:39,809
What next? For killing their boys,
they killed my boys for revenge.

1061
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:41,975
We kill them again for revenge.

1062
01:10:42,039 --> 01:10:46,078
To close the case, we spend money
on police, case and courts.

1063
01:10:46,376 --> 01:10:48,014
To earn money for that,

1064
01:10:48,078 --> 01:10:52,424
we become usury, get into real estate,
parking contract,

1065
01:10:52,449 --> 01:10:54,053
and we spread roots
into politics also.

1066
01:10:54,151 --> 01:10:55,653
There's one thing in this business.

1067
01:10:56,853 --> 01:10:59,891
If you take a life,
you will get space.

1068
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:04,136
Only if I die,
another will get that space.

1069
01:11:07,531 --> 01:11:08,839
About your parents?

1070
01:11:09,099 --> 01:11:10,077
Look at that lady there!

1071
01:11:10,701 --> 01:11:12,578
She's my mother.

1072
01:11:14,137 --> 01:11:15,980
My mother doesn't like what I do.

1073
01:11:16,039 --> 01:11:18,918
Promising to talk to me
only if I quit this profession,

1074
01:11:18,975 --> 01:11:22,923
It's 12 years now, she hasn't
spoken to me, I too didn't give up.

1075
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:24,516
Whatever it may be,
she's my mother, right?

1076
01:11:24,615 --> 01:11:26,117
She'll be just like me.

1077
01:11:27,351 --> 01:11:31,390
Fights and murders that happened
after you go into this profession.

1078
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:33,958
If you tell about that,
I can write interesting scenes.

1079
01:11:34,024 --> 01:11:34,866
Which murder should I tell them about?

1080
01:11:34,925 --> 01:11:36,495
Tell about killing
Chairman of Rampura.

1081
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:37,504
That Commission market case.

1082
01:11:37,561 --> 01:11:39,404
That happened in Sarakki.

1083
01:11:39,463 --> 01:11:42,000
I hacked him 4 times.

1084
01:11:42,065 --> 01:11:44,807
I stamped on his neck, he died.

1085
01:11:46,002 --> 01:11:48,448
He was troubling a lot to pay.

1086
01:11:48,505 --> 01:11:50,815
We took a lorry...he'd dead.

1087
01:11:51,041 --> 01:11:53,021
How about that case?

1088
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:56,548
Deep cut in was running.

1089
01:11:56,913 --> 01:12:02,693
31...32nd was...
just hacked him mercilessly.

1090
01:12:04,488 --> 01:12:07,469
Settlement, that's our biggest earner.

1091
01:12:07,524 --> 01:12:08,901
Why did you call for a meeting?

1092
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:11,529
I'm in trouble after marrying off
my daughter to him.

1093
01:12:11,595 --> 01:12:12,471
He's a crook.

1094
01:12:12,529 --> 01:12:16,136
Reason for that is fear people
have on me.

1095
01:12:18,034 --> 01:12:18,978
Tell me now.

1096
01:12:19,036 --> 01:12:19,980
Separate them.

1097
01:12:20,036 --> 01:12:22,016
What are you talking?

1098
01:12:22,439 --> 01:12:23,440
Stop it.

1099
01:12:23,507 --> 01:12:24,952
There's a package for everything.

1100
01:12:25,008 --> 01:12:27,784
Just for talks one package,
one package for beating up someone,

1101
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:29,585
one package for kidnapping
and one for stabbing,

1102
01:12:29,646 --> 01:12:31,421
if I go, it is Rs.10 lakhs,

1103
01:12:31,481 --> 01:12:32,789
if Basi goes, it is Rs.5 lakhs,

1104
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:34,055
if Boosa goes, it is Rs.3 lakhs.

1105
01:12:34,117 --> 01:12:36,097
Shut up.

1106
01:12:37,487 --> 01:12:38,864
What does it mean?

1107
01:12:48,965 --> 01:12:50,911
Pistol...Machete!
- This one?

1108
01:12:51,001 --> 01:12:52,571
This is Rudrapura special.

1109
01:12:52,602 --> 01:12:53,945
Just one shot is enough.

1110
01:12:54,004 --> 01:12:55,506
This one?
- Funds for development.

1111
01:12:55,572 --> 01:12:57,745
For which party?
- Yellow party.

1112
01:13:17,527 --> 01:13:19,564
Battery is low,
can I get it charged?

1113
01:13:23,633 --> 01:13:25,442
Is it painful?

1114
01:13:25,502 --> 01:13:26,173
Bear it.

1115
01:13:27,938 --> 01:13:29,940
Open up I say.

1116
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:31,951
Who is he?
- He's from Bengaluru.

1117
01:13:32,042 --> 01:13:33,612
He's going to make a film
on Arumugha's life.

1118
01:13:33,643 --> 01:13:35,953
On our Arumugha's life?

1119
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:38,923
Okay, this was one short in his life.

1120
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:47,561
Sign it.
- I'll not even if I've to die.

1121
01:13:47,624 --> 01:13:51,470
Why are you still using knife?
You've gun, right?

1122
01:13:51,528 --> 01:13:54,031
Can't use guns.
Company rules.

1123
01:13:54,097 --> 01:13:56,441
Did I ask you to shoot him?
Just to threaten him.

1124
01:13:56,466 --> 01:13:57,774
Come closer.

1125
01:13:58,168 --> 01:14:01,172
No...no...
- Let...what's that?

1126
01:14:01,438 --> 01:14:02,644
Let fate decide your option to sign.

1127
01:14:02,706 --> 01:14:07,621
Let fate decide how many
chances it gives you to sign.

1128
01:14:09,045 --> 01:14:12,515
You and your bloody idea!
He's dead, let's go.

1129
01:14:12,549 --> 01:14:14,187
What happened to you?

1130
01:14:14,484 --> 01:14:18,557
Holding him like this,
locking his neck,

1131
01:14:18,622 --> 01:14:20,499
opening the blade, cut him...

1132
01:14:20,557 --> 01:14:23,037
Blood oozed out.

1133
01:14:23,093 --> 01:14:24,868
You keep quiet, man.

1134
01:14:24,928 --> 01:14:29,399
It seems he cut the neck and
blood pumped out for 2 feet.

1135
01:14:29,499 --> 01:14:32,878
Do I look so foolish?

1136
01:14:32,936 --> 01:14:33,880
What?

1137
01:14:33,937 --> 01:14:36,417
Don't you believe me?
- No.

1138
01:14:36,673 --> 01:14:40,621
Won't you believe me?
- No.

1139
01:14:40,677 --> 01:14:43,419
Would you like to see?
- Okay...let me see.

1140
01:14:43,446 --> 01:14:44,720
Ready?

1141
01:14:45,048 --> 01:14:49,861
Pushing like this, locking his neck...

1142
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:53,059
Opening the blade like this...

1143
01:14:57,661 --> 01:14:58,537
What happened?

1144
01:14:58,595 --> 01:15:04,068
Had a bad dream about
killing me as demo for you.

1145
01:15:04,134 --> 01:15:08,583
Don't clap, you did the same there
also, you're not my friend but enemy.

1146
01:15:08,638 --> 01:15:12,108
They'll use me as side dish
for their drinks.

1147
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:15,588
Someone is knocking the
back door at this hour.

1148
01:15:15,645 --> 01:15:17,022
Check it.

1149
01:15:24,621 --> 01:15:27,431
What happened now
to cry so much, Lakshmi?

1150
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:30,631
How many times I had come to meet you?

1151
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:33,934
But you wantonly avoided
and ignored me.

1152
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:36,874
How many phone calls?
- I was busy with my work.

1153
01:15:36,933 --> 01:15:40,039
Don't you love me then?

1154
01:15:40,103 --> 01:15:43,607
I do love you but I can't stay
with you 24 hours.

1155
01:15:43,673 --> 01:15:46,051
I've a career to look after, right?

1156
01:15:46,509 --> 01:15:48,716
But I'm sad, right?

1157
01:15:51,147 --> 01:15:53,457
Okay, come.
Let's marry right now.

1158
01:15:53,516 --> 01:15:54,756
Let my career go to dogs.

1159
01:15:54,818 --> 01:15:57,924
The moment your uncle knows
we're married, he'll kill me.

1160
01:15:58,054 --> 01:16:00,193
Didn't I come from
Bengaluru for this?

1161
01:16:00,457 --> 01:16:03,631
Won't you marry me fearing my uncle?
- Not like that, Lakshmi.

1162
01:16:03,693 --> 01:16:05,673
I'm not ready for these commitments.

1163
01:16:05,729 --> 01:16:08,107
My career is more important.
Try to understand me.

1164
01:16:08,164 --> 01:16:10,440
Okay, your film is
more important to you.

1165
01:16:10,467 --> 01:16:11,878
That's why you're avoiding me, right?

1166
01:16:11,935 --> 01:16:15,781
Tell me, Rahul.
- Yes. I did.

1167
01:16:59,616 --> 01:17:01,960
If you melt for her,
you can't make film.

1168
01:17:02,018 --> 01:17:07,525
You'll have to go to theatre with
wife and kids to watch films.

1169
01:17:07,591 --> 01:17:10,435
Forget all this and stay
focused on the job, you got it?

1170
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:13,565
Arumugha is calling you.
- What's the matter?

1171
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:15,007
You're going back to home, right?

1172
01:17:15,064 --> 01:17:16,702
So, he's throwing a surprize party.

1173
01:17:16,766 --> 01:17:18,973
Party!

1174
01:17:47,397 --> 01:17:50,844
Let's have drinks
and clap together...

1175
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:55,900
Let's have drinks
and dance together...

1176
01:18:40,016 --> 01:18:42,963
Drink to your heart...

1177
01:18:43,153 --> 01:18:46,930
Get linked to heaven...

1178
01:18:47,023 --> 01:18:50,527
Sholay's Gabbar Singh and gang
is nothing before me...

1179
01:18:50,593 --> 01:18:54,439
Koli Manja and Razor Seena
are way behind me...

1180
01:18:54,497 --> 01:18:58,001
Hero...I'm the real hero here...

1181
01:18:58,067 --> 01:19:01,605
Who will dare win over me?

1182
01:19:01,671 --> 01:19:07,417
I'm Arumugha...

1183
01:19:07,677 --> 01:19:11,921
To hell with your film story!
Let's enjoy the party!

1184
01:19:13,449 --> 01:19:14,086
No, buddy.

1185
01:19:14,184 --> 01:19:17,654
Love is nothing but sorrow.

1186
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:20,894
Liquor has real happiness.
Take it.

1187
01:19:23,459 --> 01:19:24,631
Come on, boss.

1188
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:17,686
I've given holiday to both
true and false...

1189
01:20:18,448 --> 01:20:21,657
Yesterday and tomorrow
is nothing but lie...

1190
01:20:21,717 --> 01:20:25,529
Only today is reality,
forget everything else...

1191
01:20:25,555 --> 01:20:28,968
I'm Super Star of future...

1192
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:32,837
Cars...bars...
industry belongs to me...

1193
01:21:29,819 --> 01:21:32,390
You're making film on my life.

1194
01:21:32,421 --> 01:21:35,368
Story is fearsome, right?

1195
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:38,565
Make the film using bigger stars
than Sudeep and Darshan.

1196
01:21:38,628 --> 01:21:40,869
Make film with Rebel Star,
the film will be great.

1197
01:21:40,930 --> 01:21:41,965
Rebel star?

1198
01:21:42,031 --> 01:21:44,011
They'll not allow me to enter
his gate also.

1199
01:21:44,067 --> 01:21:45,808
Then, our Ranadheera is right choice.

1200
01:21:45,868 --> 01:21:47,370
But he must say okay, right?

1201
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:49,610
Sister, you tell me,
who will be perfect for his role?

1202
01:21:49,639 --> 01:21:52,916
I never watch films.
She watches a film every week.

1203
01:21:52,975 --> 01:21:54,852
You tell them.
- You tell us.

1204
01:21:54,911 --> 01:21:59,382
If it is Arumugha's story,
why give the role to someone else?

1205
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:01,053
Why not he himself do the role?

1206
01:22:01,417 --> 01:22:02,987
He looks like a hero.

1207
01:22:10,827 --> 01:22:12,636
I'm asking you seriously,
are you making fun of him?

1208
01:22:12,695 --> 01:22:15,835
What's wrong in her suggestion?
What does Arumugha lack?

1209
01:22:15,898 --> 01:22:18,902
He's just like Romance King Srinath
of yore days.

1210
01:22:20,403 --> 01:22:22,781
Both mother and daughter got drunk!

1211
01:22:22,839 --> 01:22:23,943
Shut up.

1212
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:30,617
It seems he's like Srinath...

1213
01:22:31,414 --> 01:22:32,552
Shut up!

1214
01:22:35,785 --> 01:22:37,093
I'm not making fun of you.

1215
01:22:37,353 --> 01:22:40,391
Fools are becoming heroes.
What do you lack?

1216
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:45,804
By any chance if you succeed as hero,
it'll help you to enter politics easily.

1217
01:22:45,861 --> 01:22:47,397
Can close all the cases against you.

1218
01:22:47,463 --> 01:22:50,410
You can grow into a big leader, right?

1219
01:22:52,802 --> 01:22:57,547
Nobody got this thought,
I too didn't get this thought.

1220
01:23:00,943 --> 01:23:05,392
Rahul, I'm the hero of my film.

1221
01:23:06,616 --> 01:23:09,927
I'm the hero of my film.

1222
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:15,863
That girl is talking mad,
why are you taking it seriously?

1223
01:23:15,925 --> 01:23:18,098
Acting means...

1224
01:23:18,394 --> 01:23:24,436
Hey! I didn't ask,
can I do the role of hero?

1225
01:23:24,467 --> 01:23:26,913
I'm saying I'm doing the role.

1226
01:23:27,904 --> 01:23:30,908
Ifilm...l hero!

1227
01:23:30,973 --> 01:23:32,418
Okay!

1228
01:23:34,177 --> 01:23:35,451
Okay!

1229
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:36,956
Come on, play music!

1230
01:23:58,501 --> 01:24:00,879
Good morning! I came to say sorry.

1231
01:24:00,937 --> 01:24:04,544
I think I went little overboard
getting drunk, right?

1232
01:24:04,607 --> 01:24:06,518
Don't take it to your heart.

1233
01:24:07,944 --> 01:24:11,050
I really got tensed taking
your words seriously.

1234
01:24:11,814 --> 01:24:13,122
Okay, please come in.

1235
01:24:13,182 --> 01:24:17,494
No...no...I've a guest,
please come to my home.

1236
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:22,464
Come.

1237
01:24:22,558 --> 01:24:24,799
Why are you tensed?
Come.

1238
01:24:29,599 --> 01:24:32,705
He's my guest.

1239
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:35,643
Sir!

1240
01:24:39,675 --> 01:24:41,052
I've already talked to him.

1241
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:46,583
For the film produced by him
and directed by you,

1242
01:24:47,049 --> 01:24:48,153
I'm the hero.

1243
01:24:48,418 --> 01:24:49,624
Sure, I'm very happy, brother.

1244
01:24:49,685 --> 01:24:51,062
Can I get any better opportunity?

1245
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:54,624
I'm really proud to introduce you
to the silver screen.

1246
01:25:04,801 --> 01:25:06,109
Forget it.

1247
01:25:06,168 --> 01:25:08,546
What's wrong if he's the hero?

1248
01:25:08,705 --> 01:25:12,482
I'm second hero, right?
We can manage it,

1249
01:25:12,642 --> 01:25:14,519
This is my life.

1250
01:25:14,777 --> 01:25:16,882
Acting is art.

1251
01:25:17,146 --> 01:25:21,754
Cinema is not a Harlem to enter
with just money and desire.

1252
01:25:21,851 --> 01:25:25,128
We've only one life,
think about it before taking decision.

1253
01:25:25,187 --> 01:25:28,134
No other way.
I'll escape tonight.

1254
01:25:28,658 --> 01:25:29,796
Escape?

1255
01:25:29,859 --> 01:25:32,430
Sorry Chikka, if you're in
trouble because of me.

1256
01:25:32,495 --> 01:25:33,701
No problem.

1257
01:25:33,763 --> 01:25:36,801
This is not worse than watching
Arumugha as film hero.

1258
01:25:36,866 --> 01:25:37,776
You go.

1259
01:25:37,967 --> 01:25:38,911
Be careful.

1260
01:25:38,968 --> 01:25:40,811
Call me on reaching your place.

1261
01:25:45,541 --> 01:25:48,545
Buddy, I brought this for you only.

1262
01:26:05,495 --> 01:26:08,533
Sir, he...

1263
01:26:13,469 --> 01:26:16,541
Buddy! Got caught?

1264
01:26:17,006 --> 01:26:19,043
Close friend, you went away.

1265
01:26:19,108 --> 01:26:22,885
I was worried when I would
see you again.

1266
01:26:30,085 --> 01:26:31,689
Will you escape?

1267
01:26:36,058 --> 01:26:38,129
Hey, get him up.

1268
01:26:43,499 --> 01:26:46,912
Do I need so much time to kill you?

1269
01:26:46,969 --> 01:26:50,041
The fear which you had on
seeing me from far away,

1270
01:26:50,106 --> 01:26:53,952
has it left you after I came close
and put my hands on you?

1271
01:26:55,911 --> 01:27:04,490
Either make me hero or
think how to make me a hero!

1272
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:08,759
Other than these two,
you don't have any choice.

1273
01:27:08,824 --> 01:27:10,064
<i>Go! W.!</i>

1274
01:27:47,096 --> 01:27:49,440
Who is it? Director?

1275
01:27:54,403 --> 01:27:55,643
Are you crying?

1276
01:28:00,076 --> 01:28:03,455
Don't worry, this is just beginning.

1277
01:28:03,813 --> 01:28:07,454
Director cries to make his
audience happy.

1278
01:28:07,483 --> 01:28:09,622
It's been 35 years.

1279
01:28:09,885 --> 01:28:14,459
I went to Bengaluru with craze
of films about 45 years ago.

1280
01:28:14,523 --> 01:28:19,632
Working as assistant director for 10 years,
learnt few things about making films.

1281
01:28:19,762 --> 01:28:22,675
Every dog has its day!

1282
01:28:22,831 --> 01:28:23,935
Like an angel's appearance.

1283
01:28:23,999 --> 01:28:27,378
If you honour her,
she'll come often.

1284
01:28:27,603 --> 01:28:32,018
If you dishonour her,
she'll never come again.

1285
01:28:32,375 --> 01:28:34,446
Everyone who aspires
to become director.

1286
01:28:34,510 --> 01:28:37,423
They think of becoming Puttanna
Kanagal with their first film.

1287
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:42,429
Few imagine themselves as Puttanna
Kanagal without even making a film.

1288
01:28:42,718 --> 01:28:47,394
They never compromise saying
can't do with this, must have this.

1289
01:28:47,456 --> 01:28:50,062
They complain about
not having slippers!

1290
01:28:50,593 --> 01:28:55,508
They miss to see a man
without legs.

1291
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:05,976
One of my film's producers,

1292
01:29:06,509 --> 01:29:09,422
he requested me to give
a small role for his brother's son.

1293
01:29:09,578 --> 01:29:12,457
I said no.
He asked why not?

1294
01:29:12,782 --> 01:29:16,855
I said get lost, I can get hundred
producers like you.

1295
01:29:16,919 --> 01:29:22,995
But since then I couldn't get at least
one out of those 100 producers.

1296
01:29:23,159 --> 01:29:29,371
So, I narrate the story of
Jagadish and Kempamma to my customers.

1297
01:29:29,432 --> 01:29:32,379
Nobody ever lived with those names.

1298
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:36,376
They were just characters of my film.

1299
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:39,882
It would've been a big hit
if I had made that film.

1300
01:29:40,009 --> 01:29:43,081
I would've been like Durai Bhagawan,
Siddalingaiah and Nagabharana.

1301
01:29:43,145 --> 01:29:45,682
I'm 64 now!

1302
01:29:45,748 --> 01:29:49,753
I could never say action and cut!

1303
01:29:50,586 --> 01:29:54,466
Are you scared you would
end up like me?

1304
01:29:54,757 --> 01:29:58,432
Only people who can cheat can succeed.

1305
01:29:58,694 --> 01:30:00,105
Mind your work.

1306
01:30:00,429 --> 01:30:01,908
I've to open the shop.

1307
01:30:02,531 --> 01:30:06,536
Not good for health to cry, go.

1308
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:22,193
What?

1309
01:30:23,085 --> 01:30:24,758
Where are you going?

1310
01:30:27,122 --> 01:30:28,726
Stop!

1311
01:30:29,992 --> 01:30:31,869
Leave him.

1312
01:30:34,363 --> 01:30:34,966
Tell me.

1313
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:36,441
For myfilm...

1314
01:30:39,101 --> 01:30:40,444
...you're the hero.

1315
01:30:43,405 --> 01:30:46,682
Debut hero gets more respect.

1316
01:30:54,383 --> 01:30:56,420
Congratulations.

1317
01:30:57,853 --> 01:31:01,426
I've become a hero!

1318
01:31:02,991 --> 01:31:05,403
No need of anything,
tell him to come back.

1319
01:31:05,427 --> 01:31:10,433
In the madness of making film if
anything goes wrong with those goons.

1320
01:31:10,532 --> 01:31:14,105
He has agreed to make a film, right?
Tell him to come back after few scenes.

1321
01:31:14,169 --> 01:31:15,147
Action!

1322
01:31:21,143 --> 01:31:22,520
Action!

1323
01:31:28,350 --> 01:31:30,887
D..d...dog!

1324
01:31:31,854 --> 01:31:36,826
You watched film...
you watched lion on

1325
01:31:36,992 --> 01:31:38,903
You saw it in photo.

1326
01:31:38,961 --> 01:31:43,967
Watched it in films...
in photos and serials...

1327
01:31:44,033 --> 01:31:46,570
Zoo...
- You saw in zoo.

1328
01:31:46,635 --> 01:31:52,745
Did you ever see it walking
majestically on road?

1329
01:31:53,742 --> 01:31:58,487
Did you see it hunt furiously alone?

1330
01:31:59,581 --> 01:32:02,061
Caw...
- Paw!

1331
01:32:02,117 --> 01:32:10,127
If I raise and hit with my paw,
it is...3 kilograms...

1332
01:32:13,796 --> 01:32:17,039
Till now you saw men in khaki uniform.

1333
01:32:17,099 --> 01:32:20,410
Have you seen cracker in khaki?

1334
01:32:20,469 --> 01:32:23,143
Pistol!
- Saw pistol!

1335
01:32:23,405 --> 01:32:25,715
God will not trouble makers.

1336
01:32:25,774 --> 01:32:27,811
If you trouble me,
I'll not spare anyone.

1337
01:32:30,379 --> 01:32:31,585
Kempe Gowda!

1338
01:32:39,889 --> 01:32:40,867
Okay?

1339
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:47,937
No way, you need acting trainer.

1340
01:32:48,997 --> 01:32:51,807
There's an acting trainer known
as All Round Arnold.

1341
01:32:51,967 --> 01:32:54,914
Get trained by him for 10 days,
let's see after that.

1342
01:32:55,804 --> 01:32:57,647
Can I also take acting
lessons from him?

1343
01:32:57,706 --> 01:33:00,915
Arumugha's story will have
my character also, right?

1344
01:33:01,477 --> 01:33:05,755
I'll also take acting training,
I'm your second hero, right?

1345
01:33:08,117 --> 01:33:11,963
Everyone who is interested in acting
can take lessons from master.

1346
01:33:12,688 --> 01:33:14,429
Let's go for film shoot
if he says okay.

1347
01:33:15,557 --> 01:33:16,797
Only if he says okay.

1348
01:33:17,826 --> 01:33:19,499
He will say...he will say.

1349
01:33:19,628 --> 01:33:21,130
I'll make him say yes.

1350
01:33:24,033 --> 01:33:24,977
Action!

1351
01:33:27,036 --> 01:33:28,481
Dog!

1352
01:33:48,691 --> 01:33:52,969
If an actor wants to act as king,

1353
01:33:53,128 --> 01:34:02,674
he must feel as king from head to toe,
heart, soul and body!

1354
01:34:03,172 --> 01:34:06,813
Only if one wants to act as king.

1355
01:34:06,875 --> 01:34:09,014
If one wants to act like a beggar.

1356
01:34:09,077 --> 01:34:12,991
Madam, please give me alms!

1357
01:34:13,115 --> 01:34:15,823
Sir, please give me alms.

1358
01:34:16,485 --> 01:34:17,691
Come here.

1359
01:34:20,522 --> 01:34:21,967
Brother!

1360
01:34:23,492 --> 01:34:25,494
I beg you, brother!

1361
01:34:25,561 --> 01:34:27,063
Please give m alms, sir.

1362
01:34:27,129 --> 01:34:28,767
My God!

1363
01:34:29,498 --> 01:34:32,502
No...no...no...

1364
01:34:32,568 --> 01:34:34,445
He's master...master...

1365
01:34:34,469 --> 01:34:35,504
Go away.

1366
01:34:36,038 --> 01:34:37,642
Forgive me, master.

1367
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:39,451
Boys did it unwittingly.

1368
01:34:39,508 --> 01:34:41,044
Are you Don of this place?

1369
01:34:41,109 --> 01:34:43,646
You may be terror to this place.

1370
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:46,625
I'm your teacher,
you're my student, that's it.

1371
01:34:48,617 --> 01:34:51,530
Listen silently whatever master says.

1372
01:34:51,587 --> 01:34:54,568
This was just a small sample.

1373
01:34:54,857 --> 01:34:57,463
The festival starts tomorrow.

1374
01:34:57,526 --> 01:35:01,941
Students, your practice starts
tomorrow morning at 5 am.

1375
01:35:02,097 --> 01:35:04,441
Be on time.
- Can't come at 5 am.

1376
01:35:04,466 --> 01:35:07,037
How dare you refuse me!

1377
01:35:07,102 --> 01:35:10,640
When you talk to me be positive.

1378
01:35:11,473 --> 01:35:14,943
Your practice starts tomorrow at 4 am.

1379
01:35:15,010 --> 01:35:15,818
Be ready!

1380
01:35:43,472 --> 01:35:44,473
Mercy!

1381
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:45,746
Romance!

1382
01:35:45,841 --> 01:35:46,819
Anger!

1383
01:35:46,842 --> 01:35:47,684
Bravery!

1384
01:35:47,743 --> 01:35:48,813
Comedy!

1385
01:35:48,877 --> 01:35:49,821
Fear!

1386
01:35:49,978 --> 01:35:51,082
Wonder!

1387
01:35:51,146 --> 01:35:52,557
Dangerous!

1388
01:35:52,614 --> 01:35:53,854
Peaceful!

1389
01:35:53,916 --> 01:35:58,990
One important thing needed for
an artiste is body language.

1390
01:35:59,054 --> 01:36:00,465
Body language?

1391
01:36:00,522 --> 01:36:03,093
Morons! That's not the thing.

1392
01:36:03,158 --> 01:36:06,935
If we don't know other language,
what would we do?

1393
01:36:06,995 --> 01:36:08,872
We'll use sign language.

1394
01:36:08,931 --> 01:36:14,973
The first language an artiste
must learn is Gibberish language.

1395
01:36:15,137 --> 01:36:15,979
Gibberish?

1396
01:36:16,038 --> 01:36:18,848
Ambarish?
- He's an artiste already.

1397
01:36:18,907 --> 01:36:20,443
You become one.

1398
01:36:24,580 --> 01:36:25,524
This is Gibberish.

1399
01:36:25,581 --> 01:36:28,084
What is best thing in Rudrapura?

1400
01:36:28,383 --> 01:36:33,093
Millet balls, country chicken and
eggs are famous in Rudrapura.

1401
01:36:33,422 --> 01:36:34,958
Tell me that in Gibberish language.

1402
01:36:35,023 --> 01:36:39,438
In Rudrapura...millet balls,
country chicken...

1403
01:36:39,495 --> 01:36:41,600
No Kannada please!

1404
01:36:41,763 --> 01:36:43,436
Gibberish.

1405
01:36:59,114 --> 01:37:00,991
Isn't it great comedy?

1406
01:37:01,049 --> 01:37:02,653
How dare you speak in Kannada!

1407
01:37:02,818 --> 01:37:05,458
Punishment, 10 times kill and laugh!

1408
01:37:05,521 --> 01:37:06,966
Kill and laugh means?

1409
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:34,554
Have your boys gone mad, Arumugha?

1410
01:37:37,753 --> 01:37:38,993
How long, master?

1411
01:37:39,054 --> 01:37:42,433
I'll start main course from tomorrow,
this is just warm up.

1412
01:37:42,491 --> 01:37:46,633
What? Warm up?
Do I look like a fool?

1413
01:37:56,538 --> 01:37:58,609
Punishment for you too.

1414
01:37:59,174 --> 01:38:00,517
Mercy...

1415
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:07,092
This is like crushing dying man's
head with stone.

1416
01:38:07,149 --> 01:38:10,494
Braverymegq!

1417
01:38:10,786 --> 01:38:12,197
Anger!

1418
01:38:12,454 --> 01:38:14,058
Furious!

1419
01:38:16,058 --> 01:38:17,128
Did I tell that?

1420
01:38:17,192 --> 01:38:18,796
Wonder!

1421
01:38:20,862 --> 01:38:23,741
Are you searching for wonder?

1422
01:38:23,799 --> 01:38:25,472
Search here, you may find something.

1423
01:38:25,601 --> 01:38:26,773
Love!

1424
01:38:28,370 --> 01:38:29,440
Cover it, man.

1425
01:38:29,471 --> 01:38:31,712
This is sex...sex maniac, go away.

1426
01:38:31,807 --> 01:38:34,083
Dangerous.
- Match box?

1427
01:38:35,744 --> 01:38:37,519
If I burn you with this,
you can never act.

1428
01:38:37,579 --> 01:38:39,115
Nine emotions.

1429
01:38:40,482 --> 01:38:41,460
Come closer.

1430
01:38:41,516 --> 01:38:46,056
There are nine emotions in you but
someone has made a cocktail of it.

1431
01:38:46,388 --> 01:38:48,595
CW, man!

1432
01:38:48,924 --> 01:38:51,768
Watching you cry, the man next
to you must also cry.

1433
01:38:51,827 --> 01:38:52,737
It must be like that.

1434
01:38:52,794 --> 01:38:53,898
Look at me!

1435
01:38:59,534 --> 01:39:01,844
Cry, boys..-¢FV---

1436
01:39:04,806 --> 01:39:07,912
Cry at least watching me cry.

1437
01:39:10,445 --> 01:39:12,755
Arumugha, please cry.

1438
01:39:14,850 --> 01:39:16,454
Cry!

1439
01:39:23,091 --> 01:39:25,435
That's it...let it come out...

1440
01:39:25,493 --> 01:39:27,370
Little more...little more...

1441
01:39:27,562 --> 01:39:28,597
That's it.

1442
01:39:31,399 --> 01:39:33,379
Ruined it.

1443
01:39:33,602 --> 01:39:35,411
What's this?

1444
01:39:35,537 --> 01:39:38,450
From where do you bring such
men to kill me?

1445
01:39:38,507 --> 01:39:43,013
If you and a girl fall in love,
I'm asking how would you express it?

1446
01:39:43,078 --> 01:39:49,495
Sorry Rahul, I came to your house and
expressed my love but you ignored it.

1447
01:39:49,685 --> 01:39:52,928
Do you know how angry I was seeing
you getting drunk and dancing?

1448
01:39:53,021 --> 01:39:56,434
So, just to rake you...
- Rake me up?

1449
01:39:56,492 --> 01:39:58,403
You ruined my career.

1450
01:39:58,426 --> 01:39:59,962
If I make film with these guys,
would it run in theatres?

1451
01:40:00,028 --> 01:40:01,473
I'm sure it'll be a flop.

1452
01:40:01,530 --> 01:40:02,634
Useless bugger!

1453
01:40:02,865 --> 01:40:06,972
3 donkeys age but yet haven't
fallen in love with any girl!

1454
01:40:07,035 --> 01:40:09,481
Don't you feel tingling
sensation on seeing a girl,

1455
01:40:09,538 --> 01:40:12,075
won't you hear a romantic tune
in the background?

1456
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:13,710
I'm Sadhu Kokila's fan.

1457
01:40:13,775 --> 01:40:15,413
Is it important now?

1458
01:40:15,443 --> 01:40:17,855
I'm furious...
- Hey you!

1459
01:40:17,912 --> 01:40:21,758
I'll rap you, bend down.

1460
01:40:21,816 --> 01:40:25,195
Even if I cut and burn you,
romance is distant dream to you.

1461
01:40:25,454 --> 01:40:27,991
Didn't you cheat me after
saying you love me?

1462
01:40:28,356 --> 01:40:29,733
That's why I took revenge.

1463
01:40:30,392 --> 01:40:31,700
TW again.

1464
01:40:31,793 --> 01:40:32,897
I'll hit you.

1465
01:40:32,961 --> 01:40:34,770
Play the song.

1466
01:40:35,764 --> 01:40:36,765
Act.

1467
01:40:38,033 --> 01:40:41,742
Love...love...

1468
01:40:46,808 --> 01:40:47,752
Switch it off.

1469
01:40:47,809 --> 01:40:51,916
You said about country chicken
and eggs are famous here.

1470
01:40:51,980 --> 01:40:53,960
Eat to your heart's content.

1471
01:40:55,116 --> 01:40:57,892
Master, don't shout on him.

1472
01:40:58,086 --> 01:41:01,590
Lakshmi madam is feeling bad about it.

1473
01:41:02,791 --> 01:41:06,034
How long should I wait?

1474
01:41:06,094 --> 01:41:07,767
Had it happened earlier
what should've happened!

1475
01:41:07,829 --> 01:41:11,436
I wouldn't get chided by strangers,
right? I didn't say this.

1476
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:12,638
Lakshmi madam said this.

1477
01:41:12,701 --> 01:41:16,945
Had I not done like that day,
you would've forgotten me.

1478
01:41:17,038 --> 01:41:20,815
You wouldn't have stayed here.
I wouldn't have met you.

1479
01:41:21,009 --> 01:41:24,786
I want you, Rahul.
Understand me.

1480
01:41:25,981 --> 01:41:31,556
I can't forget you, Rahul.
I came here to tell you this.

1481
01:41:32,487 --> 01:41:36,731
Rahul, she wished to see
me as hero, right?

1482
01:41:36,792 --> 01:41:38,100
Tell her to wait for some more time.

1483
01:41:39,461 --> 01:41:44,877
Once I become hero...
I'll marry her.

1484
01:41:45,734 --> 01:41:47,771
Play the song now.

1485
01:41:48,103 --> 01:41:50,379
He's in romantic mood.

1486
01:41:50,405 --> 01:41:58,017
You're beautiful than
beautiful moon...

1487
01:42:01,883 --> 01:42:04,056
In my 25 years of service,

1488
01:42:04,119 --> 01:42:08,966
I've never seen anyone more
foolish, idiotic and incompetent men.

1489
01:42:09,858 --> 01:42:12,634
A bunch of idiotic morons!

1490
01:42:12,927 --> 01:42:16,841
I've got them ready as much
possible as using all my experience.

1491
01:42:16,898 --> 01:42:20,107
They belong to the group of simians
hanging out on Nandi Hills.

1492
01:42:24,072 --> 01:42:25,847
It's me, sir.

1493
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:33,357
All of you stand this side.

1494
01:42:33,415 --> 01:42:34,723
Second hero is fixed.

1495
01:42:37,352 --> 01:42:38,695
We passed and he failed.

1496
01:42:39,421 --> 01:42:41,401
Arumugha, don't get angry.

1497
01:42:41,422 --> 01:42:43,424
I'll talk to master and
get you pass marks.

1498
01:42:44,793 --> 01:42:46,033
Stand this side.

1499
01:42:50,665 --> 01:42:56,445
Even if turn the earth upside down,
they can never be actors.

1500
01:42:56,504 --> 01:42:58,745
Zero...full stop!

1501
01:43:01,142 --> 01:43:05,488
But we can use them as props.

1502
01:43:05,547 --> 01:43:08,494
These guys are utter waste.

1503
01:43:08,550 --> 01:43:12,054
He's useless to come in a frame also.

1504
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:13,963
It's waste of your time.

1505
01:43:14,022 --> 01:43:17,026
Second hero chance...
- Okay, master.

1506
01:43:17,592 --> 01:43:24,441
This guy! He's the worst actor
I've ever met in my life.

1507
01:43:24,699 --> 01:43:26,770
He just acts!

1508
01:43:27,702 --> 01:43:33,516
Are there any romance and
crying scenes in your film?

1509
01:43:34,509 --> 01:43:35,078
Both are there, master.

1510
01:43:35,143 --> 01:43:36,417
You're finished.

1511
01:43:36,445 --> 01:43:41,417
If I'm in shooting spot and
goad him from behind,

1512
01:43:41,516 --> 01:43:43,621
he may do a bit of acting!
I'm not sure.

1513
01:43:44,019 --> 01:43:47,557
Other than that,
you can start the shooting.

1514
01:44:10,078 --> 01:44:13,651
Sir, inauguration scene is ready,
if you say who the chief guest is...

1515
01:44:15,016 --> 01:44:20,056
I'm the world's most foolish producer
to make a film that is bound to flop.

1516
01:44:20,121 --> 01:44:22,863
No need of clap, start.

1517
01:44:23,958 --> 01:44:26,905
Move side...come this side...

1518
01:44:27,428 --> 01:44:29,430
Krishnappa, please come here.

1519
01:44:29,497 --> 01:44:30,999
You must give the first clap
for my film.

1520
01:44:31,066 --> 01:44:32,170
Come here.

1521
01:44:32,401 --> 01:44:33,641
That side.

1522
01:44:37,138 --> 01:44:41,018
Though knowing the movie will flop...

1523
01:44:41,075 --> 01:44:44,613
He's the producer
who is investing money...

1524
01:44:44,679 --> 01:44:49,526
My fate...our fate...

1525
01:44:49,617 --> 01:44:52,564
What's this?
You committed this murder, right?

1526
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:55,464
Master, teach him to light match box.

1527
01:44:55,523 --> 01:45:00,768
This Benz body desires to act in films...
Must spend loads of cash daily for film shoot...

1528
01:45:00,829 --> 01:45:03,503
You said film like Godfather
and City of God, right?

1529
01:45:03,565 --> 01:45:04,737
What's the problem?

1530
01:45:04,799 --> 01:45:07,473
That Bluetooth guy
is creating problems.

1531
01:45:07,535 --> 01:45:08,912
One minute, brother.

1532
01:45:08,970 --> 01:45:09,971
Lights Off!

1533
01:45:11,139 --> 01:45:12,812
Who are you?

1534
01:45:13,541 --> 01:45:14,815
Lights on!

1535
01:45:15,544 --> 01:45:16,454
How is it?

1536
01:45:16,477 --> 01:45:18,821
You're a hero now, eat well.

1537
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:20,188
I don't see your daughter now.

1538
01:45:20,448 --> 01:45:22,792
Tell her to visit shooting spot.

1539
01:45:23,451 --> 01:45:25,795
It was she who wanted me
to become a hero.

1540
01:45:27,989 --> 01:45:30,492
After the dialogue is over,
Arumugha makes an entry.

1541
01:45:30,591 --> 01:45:32,434
Then...

1542
01:45:32,494 --> 01:45:33,438
Where's Arumugha?

1543
01:45:33,495 --> 01:45:34,473
He may be outside, I'll call him.

1544
01:45:34,596 --> 01:45:37,440
Where's Arumugha, master?
Need him for next shot.

1545
01:45:37,498 --> 01:45:39,444
He must be here only.
I'll call him.

1546
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:42,413
Tell me...tell me...

1547
01:45:42,503 --> 01:45:48,476
You creep! People are waiting for
film shoot, are you batting here?

1548
01:45:50,478 --> 01:45:52,185
Hey dog! Come there!

1549
01:45:52,447 --> 01:45:53,983
Come quickly.
- Coming, sir.

1550
01:45:54,048 --> 01:45:57,461
Take care of him.
- He's shouting like school master.

1551
01:45:57,518 --> 01:45:58,997
It's very difficult to tolerate him.

1552
01:45:59,054 --> 01:46:03,161
Acting like goon is difficult than
being goon, understand that.

1553
01:46:03,424 --> 01:46:04,129
He...

1554
01:46:04,192 --> 01:46:08,766
No bad words, it is cinema.

1555
01:46:09,831 --> 01:46:12,971
My 5 fingers are 5 crore...

1556
01:46:13,535 --> 01:46:15,014
5 crore...

1557
01:46:15,837 --> 01:46:16,781
Sorry sir.

1558
01:46:17,205 --> 01:46:20,084
5 crore Kanndigas!

1559
01:46:20,141 --> 01:46:25,784
He sputters like scooter
to say dialogue...

1560
01:46:33,054 --> 01:46:36,501
Director is tissue paper...
Producer has become pauper...

1561
01:46:36,558 --> 01:46:40,404
How am I to tell
what a super star he is!

1562
01:46:40,529 --> 01:46:43,135
Look at his face...
Hopeless...

1563
01:46:43,398 --> 01:46:46,470
Look at his attitude...
How arrogant he is...

1564
01:46:46,535 --> 01:46:55,455
He's indeed a great man...
He's shooting in film shoot...

1565
01:46:55,510 --> 01:47:00,789
Everything is blown into
smithereens...

1566
01:47:12,093 --> 01:47:15,040
What's this?
- For me as assistant.

1567
01:47:15,096 --> 01:47:16,507
Sir, not like that.

1568
01:47:19,534 --> 01:47:20,638
Come down.

1569
01:47:22,870 --> 01:47:24,816
They'll take my shot now.

1570
01:47:24,873 --> 01:47:26,682
Who kept the lights on field?

1571
01:47:26,741 --> 01:47:28,015
Remove it.

1572
01:47:29,043 --> 01:47:30,488
I'm telling you, clear it.

1573
01:47:30,512 --> 01:47:32,492
Buddy, he's asking me to
remove the light.

1574
01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:34,856
He's asking you, right?
Why don't you do it?

1575
01:47:39,888 --> 01:47:42,562
Look here second hero is
carrying lights.

1576
01:47:43,391 --> 01:47:44,768
Do you need this?

1577
01:47:44,826 --> 01:47:45,998
In future I'm the hero.

1578
01:47:46,060 --> 01:47:49,473
The trouble he gives...
Even dead will squirm...

1579
01:47:49,530 --> 01:47:53,706
Generator goes dead for
his re-takes...

1580
01:48:01,142 --> 01:48:05,056
He's a loose character...
Worst actor...

1581
01:48:05,113 --> 01:48:09,459
Director loses his brain over him...

1582
01:48:09,517 --> 01:48:14,091
Check his caste...
Check his style...

1583
01:48:14,121 --> 01:48:18,570
Check his attitude...
Check his brain...

1584
01:48:18,626 --> 01:48:24,201
He's a shooter...
Earlier he was fan of Kichcha...

1585
01:48:24,465 --> 01:48:26,911
Are you mad?
You must hit only for action.

1586
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:40,424
Pack up!

1587
01:48:40,482 --> 01:48:43,429
Pumpkin...come within frame.

1588
01:48:44,919 --> 01:48:45,761
Done!

1589
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:48,398
Look how these guys are sanding
after stealing our money.

1590
01:48:48,423 --> 01:48:49,424
Useless buggers.

1591
01:48:49,491 --> 01:48:51,528
Look, producer is riding a bicycle.

1592
01:48:51,593 --> 01:48:52,901
At least he has that.

1593
01:48:56,464 --> 01:48:57,875
What happened?

1594
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:02,607
Fell down...l tripped and fell down.

1595
01:49:02,670 --> 01:49:06,516
Where?
- In bath room.

1596
01:49:06,674 --> 01:49:08,915
While switching on heater...

1597
01:49:11,713 --> 01:49:13,192
Were you all taking bath together?

1598
01:49:14,082 --> 01:49:15,925
Is it important now?

1599
01:49:27,595 --> 01:49:30,041
I'm getting married in 3 months,
are you happy now?

1600
01:49:30,498 --> 01:49:33,411
If this film flops,
you can make another film.

1601
01:49:33,468 --> 01:49:34,776
But what about my life?

1602
01:49:34,835 --> 01:49:36,872
I really love you, Rahul.

1603
01:49:36,971 --> 01:49:42,614
I'm not a heroine in film to
marry hero going against everyone.

1604
01:49:42,677 --> 01:49:50,596
I'll cry for few days, then I'll marry
Arumugha and live with tears.

1605
01:49:51,118 --> 01:49:53,428
I don't know what to tell you!

1606
01:49:53,488 --> 01:49:56,594
All my answers may appear
like questions to you.

1607
01:49:56,657 --> 01:50:00,764
I asked for little time then,
I'm asking the same again.

1608
01:50:17,412 --> 01:50:21,918
I'm not a film hero to take you away
after thrashing Arumugha.

1609
01:50:25,153 --> 01:50:27,861
But I want to become a hero.

1610
01:50:27,922 --> 01:50:31,460
3 months time is there, let's see.

1611
01:50:38,899 --> 01:50:41,379
He's coming...Arumugha!

1612
01:50:41,402 --> 01:50:44,940
Terror Star Arumugha's
film 'A Arumugha'

1613
01:50:45,006 --> 01:50:48,419
This Friday in theatres near you.

1614
01:50:48,476 --> 01:50:51,685
Don't miss, watch it.

1615
01:50:54,382 --> 01:50:55,690
Lift him up!

1616
01:50:58,019 --> 01:51:02,399
The day my film releases,
it's Deepavali for Rudrapura.

1617
01:51:02,423 --> 01:51:06,894
Entire Karnataka must know
who Arumugha is!

1618
01:51:09,931 --> 01:51:11,501
In the history of Rudrapura...

1619
01:51:11,566 --> 01:51:13,978
Not only here but in Karnataka
and entire India,

1620
01:51:14,035 --> 01:51:20,008
first time all the theatres in
Rudrapura district will play same film!

1621
01:51:20,074 --> 01:51:24,454
It's festive time
for entire Rudrapura.

1622
01:51:24,512 --> 01:51:28,892
Where ever you may go,
only one name greets you...Arumugha!

1623
01:51:28,949 --> 01:51:32,021
Why the title is A Arumugha!

1624
01:51:32,086 --> 01:51:33,793
A means assault.

1625
01:51:33,988 --> 01:51:36,400
I'm well known as Assault Arumugha.

1626
01:51:36,457 --> 01:51:37,993
That's why!

1627
01:51:38,392 --> 01:51:39,666
A Arumugha!

1628
01:51:39,761 --> 01:51:44,107
We play only Hindi films
in my theatre, we too know goons.

1629
01:51:44,398 --> 01:51:46,435
Do whatsoever you can!

1630
01:51:49,003 --> 01:51:52,883
Karnataka Govt. Work in progress,
inconvenience regretted

1631
01:51:53,474 --> 01:51:56,421
Arumugha's film is releasing tomorrow,
you must play the film for a year.

1632
01:51:56,477 --> 01:51:58,115
Got it?
- Okay, brother.

1633
01:51:58,379 --> 01:52:02,384
It is my film,
it mustn't flop at any cost.

1634
01:52:02,417 --> 01:52:03,521
It's humiliation if it flops.

1635
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:05,393
We've distributed tickets
to every household.

1636
01:52:05,420 --> 01:52:09,425
This Friday Arumugha's film is releasing,
entire family must come to watch it.

1637
01:52:09,490 --> 01:52:11,527
Friday?
We've to go to work, right?

1638
01:52:11,592 --> 01:52:13,594
Work? Take leave.

1639
01:52:13,661 --> 01:52:19,043
We've paid for biryani, drinks and side dish
to every person coming to watch film.

1640
01:52:19,100 --> 01:52:21,706
Grandma,
ticket to watch Arumugha's film.

1641
01:52:21,736 --> 01:52:23,079
Come without fail.
- Okay.

1642
01:52:23,103 --> 01:52:24,081
Bring him also.

1643
01:52:24,105 --> 01:52:26,551
Arranged buses for people
coming from far away places.

1644
01:52:26,574 --> 01:52:27,882
You must watch every show, okay?

1645
01:52:27,942 --> 01:52:29,444
Check everything.

1646
01:52:31,946 --> 01:52:35,450
150 tickets, if I find one seat
empty, I'll cut your throat.

1647
01:52:37,952 --> 01:52:41,126
Arumugha is the hero of
the film A Arumugha!

1648
01:52:41,389 --> 01:52:46,532
Gandhi Nagar is going crazy over
the release of new hero's film.

1649
01:52:46,594 --> 01:52:51,009
The reason for it is Arumugha's film
A Arumugha!

1650
01:53:00,441 --> 01:53:02,580
Is this the action film
I asked from you?

1651
01:53:02,643 --> 01:53:05,647
I could manage only this
with these people, sir.

1652
01:53:09,984 --> 01:53:11,895
Why are you crying, sir?

1653
01:53:19,394 --> 01:53:23,001
Father, I'll not come, you carry on.
- Why?

1654
01:53:23,431 --> 01:53:24,569
I'll stay here.

1655
01:53:34,942 --> 01:53:36,819
House full?

1656
01:54:11,479 --> 01:54:14,050
Raising head...picking up machete...
lording over...

1657
01:54:14,581 --> 01:54:17,528
Killing people,
the man who earned fame as goon,

1658
01:54:17,585 --> 01:54:19,826
that's A Arumugha of Rudrapura!

1659
01:54:20,187 --> 01:54:22,599
What is Arumugha?
- What he is?

1660
01:54:22,657 --> 01:54:24,159
CW baby Arumugha!

1661
01:54:24,659 --> 01:54:26,138
What did he do?

1662
01:54:26,193 --> 01:54:28,935
Cheating people with his cries,

1663
01:54:29,030 --> 01:54:31,909
he made an attempt to
become a fearsome goon!

1664
01:54:32,132 --> 01:54:35,136
Who is Cry baby Arumugha?
- Who is he?

1665
01:54:35,403 --> 01:54:37,508
Here he comes!

1666
01:54:57,458 --> 01:55:00,029
I never worked so hard in my life.

1667
01:55:00,094 --> 01:55:04,543
If you try to make a goon film
with Arumugha.

1668
01:55:04,598 --> 01:55:06,578
I don't think people will
throw cakes at you,

1669
01:55:06,634 --> 01:55:08,113
I don't know with
what they'll hit you!

1670
01:55:08,135 --> 01:55:09,910
For God's sake,
plan something else.

1671
01:55:17,044 --> 01:55:18,114
Master!

1672
01:55:20,214 --> 01:55:24,788
You're acting seriously,
but people are laughing at you.

1673
01:55:25,486 --> 01:55:29,593
After this scene,
I'll gun down everyone here.

1674
01:55:29,657 --> 01:55:32,399
They'll go silent.

1675
01:55:42,436 --> 01:55:45,713
These 5 fingers...
I don't know, sir.

1676
01:55:45,773 --> 01:55:47,775
He made me a fool.

1677
01:55:49,810 --> 01:55:51,016
R0ll...
-What?

1678
01:55:51,079 --> 01:55:52,615
Roll!

1679
01:55:57,618 --> 01:55:59,564
I'm a biryani eating bow-bow.

1680
01:55:59,620 --> 01:56:01,065
You never delivered this
dialogue in shooting.

1681
01:56:01,122 --> 01:56:03,102
I never delivered this
dialogue that day.

1682
01:56:03,157 --> 01:56:05,000
This is not my voice,
someone else dubbed it.

1683
01:56:05,059 --> 01:56:07,096
Can they change voice like that?

1684
01:56:09,797 --> 01:56:11,504
Why are you crying, sir?

1685
01:56:13,701 --> 01:56:15,112
You gave him a fitting reply!

1686
01:56:15,169 --> 01:56:16,512
Arumugha must lose his face!

1687
01:56:16,570 --> 01:56:19,517
Audience must laugh, clap
and blow whistles at him.

1688
01:56:19,573 --> 01:56:23,020
You won...you won!

1689
01:56:24,679 --> 01:56:27,956
Earlier he cut the call,
now the phone is switched off.

1690
01:56:28,015 --> 01:56:34,591
Look at Arumugha...
Here comes Arumugha...

1691
01:56:34,655 --> 01:56:37,602
The song was different while
shooting but now it is another song.

1692
01:56:37,658 --> 01:56:42,835
Here comes Arumugha...

1693
01:56:44,031 --> 01:56:48,446
I'm seeing for the first time people
laughing so loud for a song.

1694
01:56:50,471 --> 01:56:53,941
He took revenge for wishing
to become a hero.

1695
01:56:54,008 --> 01:56:56,648
Light...light it.

1696
01:56:56,877 --> 01:56:57,912
Cry!

1697
01:56:58,846 --> 01:57:01,725
I'm biryani eating bow-bow.

1698
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:08,133
Jump..-jl~ll'"P---

1699
01:57:36,717 --> 01:57:39,596
Did he take revenge on me?

1700
01:57:39,653 --> 01:57:42,133
Staying, eating and
drinking in my home.

1701
01:57:42,389 --> 01:57:45,427
Listening to my story,
he avenged me.

1702
01:57:45,493 --> 01:57:48,838
That's why I told you
never trust educated people.

1703
01:57:49,029 --> 01:57:50,804
Bloody fools!

1704
01:57:51,632 --> 01:57:53,475
My darling!

1705
01:57:53,534 --> 01:57:55,514
Well made film.

1706
01:57:57,471 --> 01:58:01,112
What's this Arumugha?
You made a comedy film.

1707
01:58:02,176 --> 01:58:03,917
You made a good film.

1708
01:58:04,044 --> 01:58:06,991
You turned an action king
into comedy king.

1709
01:58:07,047 --> 01:58:08,549
He'll be the comedian for 10 years.

1710
01:58:09,183 --> 01:58:11,686
You next film is also from
my banner, right?

1711
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:14,097
I'll go away to Malaysia.

1712
01:58:14,155 --> 01:58:15,725
Don't get caught with him.

1713
01:58:15,790 --> 01:58:17,895
If you're caught, finished,
got it, right?

1714
01:58:19,793 --> 01:58:21,204
One minute, sir.

1715
01:58:21,461 --> 01:58:26,103
How did you get the concept
of goon and comedy film?

1716
01:58:26,166 --> 01:58:30,478
Generally people are scared of
goons who kill and plunder.

1717
01:58:30,837 --> 01:58:34,910
I wanted to make a comedy film
with fearsome goon.

1718
01:58:35,009 --> 01:58:41,858
The fact is half of the fearsome goons
are practically jokers in real life.

1719
01:58:42,382 --> 01:58:43,417
I just showed that.

1720
01:58:43,484 --> 01:58:47,933
Hero was brilliant as comedian,
where did you get the hero?

1721
01:58:50,658 --> 01:58:52,968
I wanted a face which could
make anyone laugh on seeing.

1722
01:58:53,027 --> 01:58:55,507
And I wanted the face to perfectly
match Cry Baby Arumugha's character.

1723
01:58:55,563 --> 01:58:59,511
Among all the faces that I've seen,
this is the best face!

1724
01:58:59,700 --> 01:59:01,737
Thank you.
- Look at him!

1725
01:59:02,936 --> 01:59:04,415
Arumugha!

1726
01:59:04,438 --> 01:59:07,442
Cry Baby Arumugha film is super hit!
- Cry Baby Arumugha!

1727
01:59:10,077 --> 01:59:13,149
All of them have planned
and escaped.

1728
01:59:13,714 --> 01:59:17,161
Fear of us is our chief weapon.

1729
01:59:18,519 --> 01:59:24,128
All my years of hard work,
lost it in just a day!

1730
01:59:25,159 --> 01:59:28,470
Must find and kill that dog Rahul!

1731
01:59:28,629 --> 01:59:31,769
I must kill him with my hands.

1732
01:59:43,110 --> 01:59:44,521
Catch it!

1733
01:59:45,479 --> 01:59:46,958
Can't you see properly?

1734
01:59:50,384 --> 01:59:51,988
Is he here?

1735
01:59:52,052 --> 01:59:54,726
He's in foreign,
he'll come after 2 weeks.

1736
02:00:10,938 --> 02:00:12,975
If Arumugha comes,
it'll cost Rs.10 lakhs.

1737
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:13,916
Rs.10 lakhs?

1738
02:00:13,974 --> 02:00:15,044
You come and settle the deal.

1739
02:00:15,108 --> 02:00:18,646
If he comes, boys there may
laugh it away.

1740
02:00:18,712 --> 02:00:21,454
The job will not be done.

1741
02:00:21,515 --> 02:00:24,985
You please come and
settle the matter.

1742
02:00:37,565 --> 02:00:39,135
God, save me!

1743
02:00:46,607 --> 02:00:49,679
I don't know...l don't know...

1744
02:00:52,012 --> 02:00:52,956
What?

1745
02:00:53,013 --> 02:00:55,493
They hit him in temple.

1746
02:00:55,549 --> 02:00:57,586
Expecting trouble from
Arumugha if he comes out,

1747
02:00:57,651 --> 02:00:58,959
I've got him admitted
to hospital.

1748
02:00:59,019 --> 02:00:59,963
He's in ICU.

1749
02:01:00,020 --> 02:01:02,466
I've sent your parents safely
to Bombay.

1750
02:01:02,522 --> 02:01:04,593
They want to talk to you,
shall I make a call?

1751
02:01:04,925 --> 02:01:08,395
Why are you we living in hiding?
What have I done to him?

1752
02:01:08,428 --> 02:01:12,171
He started hitting people for
laughing at him in a school drama.

1753
02:01:12,433 --> 02:01:17,542
But today entire state is laughing
at him because of you.

1754
02:01:17,604 --> 02:01:20,676
Did I ask him to act?
He insisted on doing it.

1755
02:01:21,675 --> 02:01:24,622
In fact I must go after him
with vengeance.

1756
02:01:24,678 --> 02:01:26,658
I'll show him his place!
- What will you do?

1757
02:01:26,747 --> 02:01:27,953
Total 48!

1758
02:01:30,451 --> 02:01:31,930
48!

1759
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:35,929
Had I killed you both,
it would've been 50!

1760
02:01:35,989 --> 02:01:38,868
Had you shown this 3 months ago,
no need to make a film at all.

1761
02:01:38,926 --> 02:01:42,601
Time was running bad,
just now I got this flash, uncle.

1762
02:01:42,963 --> 02:01:43,703
What shall we do now?

1763
02:01:43,797 --> 02:01:46,471
I've talked to ACP,
this proof is more than enough.

1764
02:01:46,533 --> 02:01:48,809
Lodge complaint with Kunigal
police station tomorrow morning...

1765
02:01:48,869 --> 02:01:52,373
Kunigal? Just further up
we'll reach Rudrapura.

1766
02:01:52,406 --> 02:01:55,944
Is Arumugha Saddam Hussein to take
the evidence from police station?

1767
02:01:56,009 --> 02:01:57,579
They'll search for you in Bengaluru.

1768
02:01:57,644 --> 02:01:59,988
That's why I hid you near Rudrapura.

1769
02:02:00,047 --> 02:02:03,517
To escape from enemies,
we must sit on their backs.

1770
02:02:03,583 --> 02:02:06,655
What about our future?

1771
02:02:06,687 --> 02:02:10,863
My wife delivered child a week ago.
I haven't yet seen the face.

1772
02:02:10,924 --> 02:02:13,962
Just 10 days only.
- Would he forget after that?

1773
02:02:14,028 --> 02:02:15,769
He'll vanish.

1774
02:02:16,029 --> 02:02:18,532
He has accepted to killing 48 persons.

1775
02:02:19,733 --> 02:02:21,007
I'm a reporter, would I spare him?

1776
02:02:21,068 --> 02:02:24,641
Let the proof get okayed,
ACP has promised to get the order.

1777
02:02:24,705 --> 02:02:26,912
Order? What order?

1778
02:02:26,974 --> 02:02:29,420
What else? Encounter.

1779
02:02:30,677 --> 02:02:32,714
Would they kill him?

1780
02:02:33,847 --> 02:02:35,349
Let him die!

1781
02:02:35,382 --> 02:02:37,794
In the history of Kannada films...

1782
02:02:37,851 --> 02:02:40,695
Arumugha is on TV also!

1783
02:02:40,754 --> 02:02:44,566
I had a hearty laugh in theatre
the other day.

1784
02:02:45,058 --> 02:02:48,403
Over 50 lakhs people have
watched it on YouTube.

1785
02:02:48,428 --> 02:02:52,376
Wonder...surprize...
- What are you doing?

1786
02:02:52,433 --> 02:02:54,413
TVHHTV...

1787
02:02:55,002 --> 02:02:55,946
Have you gone mad?

1788
02:02:56,003 --> 02:02:57,539
Why are you behaving like mad man?

1789
02:02:57,804 --> 02:02:59,408
He has made me a mad man.

1790
02:02:59,673 --> 02:03:03,450
People are laughing at me and both
mother and daughter are enjoying it.

1791
02:03:03,510 --> 02:03:04,750
I'll hit you!

1792
02:03:04,812 --> 02:03:06,519
Nothing has happened
as you think, Arumugha.

1793
02:03:06,580 --> 02:03:09,993
When the town is praising you,
do you know how proud I feel about it?

1794
02:03:10,050 --> 02:03:14,590
What's this?
Did you ever speak to me so much?

1795
02:03:14,655 --> 02:03:16,032
Where did you muster
so much courage?

1796
02:03:16,090 --> 02:03:18,900
You don't fear me anymore
that's why you're arguing with me.

1797
02:03:18,959 --> 02:03:19,596
I'll cut you up!

1798
02:03:19,660 --> 02:03:21,833
What are you doing?
Come this side.

1799
02:03:21,895 --> 02:03:24,501
What are you doing?
Raising hands on women.

1800
02:03:24,664 --> 02:03:26,940
If you sit in home like this,
you would end up as joker.

1801
02:03:27,034 --> 02:03:28,638
I've found Rahul's whereabouts.

1802
02:03:28,702 --> 02:03:30,477
We'll kidnap him in 2 days.

1803
02:03:30,504 --> 02:03:31,847
Turn this side.

1804
02:03:31,872 --> 02:03:36,912
If you kill few people, people
laughing at you would start shivering.

1805
02:03:36,977 --> 02:03:37,785
Yes, brother.

1806
02:03:37,845 --> 02:03:39,085
What Basi says is right!

1807
02:03:39,146 --> 02:03:41,854
Brother, Shiva's father is dead.
- Where?

1808
02:03:42,049 --> 02:03:44,495
In his home.

1809
02:03:44,618 --> 02:03:46,188
Got call just now.

1810
02:03:47,688 --> 02:03:50,430
Would they kill all of them?

1811
02:03:50,457 --> 02:03:53,631
I don't know about others
but Arumugha will surely die.

1812
02:03:53,694 --> 02:03:56,800
I don't think this is right,
isn't this wrong?

1813
02:03:56,863 --> 02:03:58,536
Is it okay to die in his hands?

1814
02:03:58,699 --> 02:04:01,805
What is important now is
whether he hits me first or I!

1815
02:04:02,035 --> 02:04:06,984
He said it's not wrong
to kill enemy to save our life.

1816
02:04:11,145 --> 02:04:11,987
What's that?

1817
02:04:12,078 --> 02:04:14,149
Uncle gave this gun for safety.

1818
02:04:14,714 --> 02:04:15,715
Stop!

1819
02:04:42,409 --> 02:04:43,479
Entire town is crying for him.

1820
02:04:43,544 --> 02:04:44,454
Cry, my foot!

1821
02:04:44,511 --> 02:04:45,581
Just hogwash!

1822
02:04:45,646 --> 02:04:47,751
It's disgusting life here.

1823
02:04:47,815 --> 02:04:51,126
People who supported my father
when he was alive,

1824
02:04:51,418 --> 02:04:54,422
not one of them has come
to pay respects after he died.

1825
02:04:54,621 --> 02:04:55,725
This is just eye wash.

1826
02:04:55,822 --> 02:05:01,465
We mistake people's fear as respect.

1827
02:05:01,595 --> 02:05:05,065
Didn't I tell you?
He's the hero of the film A Arumugha!

1828
02:05:05,432 --> 02:05:11,007
People were more happy than sad
on hearing my father's death.

1829
02:05:11,171 --> 02:05:14,015
Enough of all this, brother.

1830
02:05:14,474 --> 02:05:17,819
Aren't you the hero of A Arumugha?

1831
02:05:18,812 --> 02:05:20,655
Yes. He's the hero.

1832
02:05:20,714 --> 02:05:23,661
It seems film is big hit,
I'll watch after obsequies.

1833
02:05:23,717 --> 02:05:27,426
I watched the film for 4 days.
You did a great job, sir.

1834
02:05:27,487 --> 02:05:33,460
Watching your comedy I laughed so
much that my cheeks started paining.

1835
02:05:33,493 --> 02:05:38,499
Your fights and dances were great!

1836
02:05:40,034 --> 02:05:43,413
Didn't I tell you? He's that hero.
- Is it?

1837
02:05:43,437 --> 02:05:44,939
It seems he's the hero.

1838
02:05:46,740 --> 02:05:49,914
Please wait for a moment, sir.

1839
02:05:50,677 --> 02:05:51,883
Sundara's wife!

1840
02:05:51,945 --> 02:05:55,859
I'll go away to some faraway place,
I made a mistake, brother.

1841
02:05:55,916 --> 02:06:00,058
We watched your film, sir.
You acted very well.

1842
02:06:00,521 --> 02:06:03,627
I never stepped out of home
after my husband's death.

1843
02:06:03,690 --> 02:06:08,161
Your boys forced me
to watch your film.

1844
02:06:09,129 --> 02:06:11,473
After long time I laughed out loud!

1845
02:06:11,565 --> 02:06:14,944
After watching the film,
she has become your fan.

1846
02:06:15,035 --> 02:06:18,482
She insists on going again
to watch the film.

1847
02:06:18,505 --> 02:06:21,816
She saw you inside and
wanted to meet you.

1848
02:06:21,875 --> 02:06:23,513
That's why I brought her.

1849
02:06:23,577 --> 02:06:26,649
You wanted to meet him, right?
Talk to him, dear.

1850
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:31,420
Uncle, your dance
and fights were great!

1851
02:06:31,485 --> 02:06:34,125
Cry Baby Arumugha film was great!

1852
02:06:34,387 --> 02:06:36,492
Talked to him? Are you happy now?

1853
02:06:36,556 --> 02:06:37,432
Shall we go?

1854
02:06:37,557 --> 02:06:38,831
Bye .

1855
02:06:41,795 --> 02:06:43,706
Don't they know it?
- Nobody knows it.

1856
02:06:43,763 --> 02:06:47,176
Case is closed as Deeva killed
Sundara and we killed him.

1857
02:07:04,718 --> 02:07:06,061
Greetings, sir.

1858
02:07:25,639 --> 02:07:28,017
Buddy, I think we
mustn't go to police.

1859
02:07:28,141 --> 02:07:29,950
Whatever it may be,
it turned good for you, right?

1860
02:07:30,010 --> 02:07:31,887
Don't just repeat the same things.

1861
02:07:32,045 --> 02:07:35,822
If you really want to help,
tell everything to police.

1862
02:07:36,016 --> 02:07:38,929
Shall we do one thing? We'll
get caught if we stay here, right?

1863
02:07:39,019 --> 02:07:40,430
Shall we go away to some
far off place?

1864
02:07:40,454 --> 02:07:44,596
Someday we've to come back,
what if we get caught then?

1865
02:07:47,661 --> 02:07:49,163
Already we're caught!

1866
02:07:55,969 --> 02:07:59,439
Leave me...

1867
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:02,841
Where is God?

1868
02:09:03,603 --> 02:09:06,049
It seems father is with God.

1869
02:09:06,106 --> 02:09:09,417
Mother always tells me this.

1870
02:09:09,442 --> 02:09:12,855
Will you take me to God?

1871
02:09:13,046 --> 02:09:15,686
I want my father.

1872
02:09:15,949 --> 02:09:17,860
You're a Hero, right?

1873
02:09:18,919 --> 02:09:20,796
Please uncle.

1874
02:09:20,854 --> 02:09:22,060
Please!

1875
02:09:25,092 --> 02:09:26,162
Please!

1876
02:11:10,030 --> 02:11:11,839
Stop son!

1877
02:11:19,539 --> 02:11:22,452
Get me some water to drink, son!

1878
02:13:02,409 --> 02:13:05,822
Never again show up before me!

1879
02:13:06,012 --> 02:13:08,390
I'm sparing your life!

1880
02:13:08,482 --> 02:13:09,654
Get lost!

1881
02:13:10,783 --> 02:13:11,921
Go away!

1882
02:13:34,674 --> 02:13:36,017
Thanks!

1883
02:13:37,811 --> 02:13:39,119
Come, Chikka.

1884
02:13:41,080 --> 02:13:42,684
Do you've Ramgopal Varma's number?

1885
02:13:42,749 --> 02:13:44,695
He's a director not street artiste.

1886
02:13:45,452 --> 02:13:47,557
Forget it...who is that?

1887
02:13:47,620 --> 02:13:49,861
Do you've at least
Kichcha Sudeep's number?

1888
02:14:09,476 --> 02:14:10,511
Greetings, brother.

1889
02:14:19,753 --> 02:14:20,823
Greetings, brother.

1890
02:14:21,120 --> 02:14:24,033
Sir, Arumugha is here.
Finish him?

1891
02:14:25,725 --> 02:14:26,863
Okay, sir.

1892
02:14:37,036 --> 02:14:38,014
What?

1893
02:14:38,037 --> 02:14:39,744
Rahul told us to present you a gift.

1894
02:14:50,683 --> 02:14:54,028
Sir, Jigar means heart,
Thanda means cool.

1895
02:14:54,087 --> 02:14:55,498
Cold heart!

1896
02:14:55,555 --> 02:14:57,865
Story about a ruthless and
merciless man.

1897
02:14:58,057 --> 02:15:03,473
With a strong message
against atrocities in society...

1898
02:15:04,730 --> 02:15:06,471
I'm not saying your story is not good.

1899
02:15:06,599 --> 02:15:07,577
Story is good.

1900
02:15:07,834 --> 02:15:11,714
For the present no dates.
Can we wait for 2 years?

1901
02:15:18,845 --> 02:15:22,122
Film shoot starts in 2 months!
You're doing the film.

1902
02:15:22,648 --> 02:15:24,753
Am I doing the film?

1903
02:15:25,151 --> 02:15:27,028
Are you threatening me in my office?

1904
02:15:27,086 --> 02:15:29,088
Whoever the producer may be
or director,

1905
02:15:29,489 --> 02:15:31,628
you can't step into Gandhi Nagar,
I'm challenging you.

1906
02:15:31,691 --> 02:15:32,635
Get up!

1907
02:15:54,914 --> 02:15:56,086
Hooliganism?

1908
02:16:03,056 --> 02:16:04,034
Cut it!

1909
02:16:05,458 --> 02:16:06,528
Okay?

1910
02:16:07,994 --> 02:16:09,439
Okay, right?

1911
02:16:10,430 --> 02:16:12,000
Is it okay, sir?

1912
02:16:12,765 --> 02:16:13,903
What?

1913
02:16:19,005 --> 02:16:21,576
What's this, sir?
16 bullets are pumped into his body.

1914
02:16:21,641 --> 02:16:24,622
Tell him to act at least
little before dying.

1915
02:16:25,077 --> 02:16:26,112
Okay.

1916
02:16:26,179 --> 02:16:29,126
He can't act even if I fire him
with cannon, what can I do?

1917
02:16:29,382 --> 02:16:32,124
Look, this is not good.

1918
02:16:38,424 --> 02:16:41,064
I'm not asking do you wish
to act in my film.

1919
02:16:41,094 --> 02:16:43,040
I'm telling you're acting in my film.

1920
02:16:43,062 --> 02:16:45,440
Director is spitting on
my face to get better act.

1921
02:16:45,531 --> 02:16:47,101
Okay, I'll do it.

1922
02:16:47,166 --> 02:16:50,636
But my next film will be directed
by Ramgopal Varma.

1923
02:16:51,170 --> 02:16:51,875
Okay?

1924
02:16:51,938 --> 02:16:55,545
Uncle! Do you want juice?

1925
02:16:55,608 --> 02:16:56,484
Juice too for him?

1926
02:16:56,543 --> 02:16:57,920
Don't call me uncle!

1927
02:16:58,178 --> 02:16:59,748
Call dad!

1928
02:17:01,080 --> 02:17:02,081
Laugh!

1929
02:17:02,148 --> 02:17:03,559
Love?

1930
02:17:04,517 --> 02:17:06,622
Can't act but want romance!

1931
02:17:06,686 --> 02:17:08,188
My dear Lakshmi!

1932
02:17:09,822 --> 02:17:11,495
I'm in his office.

1933
02:17:13,126 --> 02:17:14,935
He'll say okay, no problem.

1934
02:17:16,596 --> 02:17:18,633
Wait...he said okay!

1935
02:17:21,934 --> 02:17:24,471
My wife...your fan!

1936
02:17:26,172 --> 02:17:29,517
She wants you to act in my film
with moustache and beard.

1937
02:17:29,575 --> 02:17:30,553
You'll look good.

1938
02:17:30,610 --> 02:17:33,489
Okay, it'll be good.

1939
02:17:33,546 --> 02:17:37,722
Just now you narrated the script,
right? Jigarthanda!

1940
02:17:37,784 --> 02:17:44,793
A hero who fights against goons
who trouble innocent people.

1941
02:17:44,857 --> 02:17:45,665
Correct.

1942
02:17:48,428 --> 02:17:51,932
Good, there's good
social message in it.

1943
02:17:53,032 --> 02:17:54,033
Excellent script.

1944
02:17:57,604 --> 02:17:59,880
Respect for violence is different.

1945
02:18:09,415 --> 02:18:10,416
This is fine.
