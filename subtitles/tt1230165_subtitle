1
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:17,344
-Standard four-by-four groove.
-Sure... entry chord, D major?

2
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:22,766
Rob doesn't know a thing about keyboards.
He begins every song in D major

3
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,103
Adi, have you written any lyrics?

4
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:31,150
-Yeah. -You know, there are so
many things in life we hardly think of..

5
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,569
Simple things

6
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,991
Why is the sky blue?
Why is water so wet?

7
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,787
Why is the earth round?
And so on and so forth.

8
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,666
Rob, let's start it with a good riff.

9
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,711
Then I'll introduce texture..

10
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,380
How's that, KD?

11
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,550
Joe starts with the riff,
then keyboards...

12
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,261
I'll kick in with the drums
and then Aditya, you can take over

13
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,516
No one takes over in this band

14
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,604
That's why we're called Magik

15
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,841
Why is the sky blue?
Why is water wet?

16
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,636
Why is the earth round?

17
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:45,140
What makes silk soft?
What makes fire hot?

18
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,185
Why doesn't two
and two make five?

19
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,189
Why are trees vanishing?
Why do we have three seasons?

20
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,858
Why don't we have two moons?

21
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:59,446
Why is there war?
Why flows the red?

22
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,449
And borders everywhere?

23
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:06,119
Ever wondered...
have you?

24
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,706
Ever wondered...
what's this all about?

25
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:14,461
Ever wondered...?
If you haven't, then do it now

26
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,717
Why do all rivers flow?
What's light, d'you know?

27
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,345
What makes snow fall?

28
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:28,016
Why do friends keep falling out?
Why do stars fall?

29
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,103
Why is there lightning in clouds?

30
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,773
Ever wondered...
have you?

31
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:38,318
Ever wondered...
what's this all about?

32
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:43,490
Ever wondered...?
If you haven't, then do it now

33
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:52,124
Silence can't be heard

34
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:59,298
And the wind can't be seen

35
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:09,141
Ever wondered...
why does it happen?

36
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,812
Why skies are blue?
Why is water wet?

37
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,565
Why is the earth round?

38
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:03,278
What makes silk soft?
What makes fire hot?

39
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,198
Why don't two and two make five?

40
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:10,118
Why are trees vanishing?
Why are there only three seasons?

41
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,580
Why aren't there two moons?

42
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:17,542
Why is there war?
Why flows the red?

43
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,587
Why are borders everywhere?

44
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:24,091
Ever wondered...
have you?

45
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,761
Ever wondered...
what's this all about?

46
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:33,225
Ever wondered...?
If you haven't, then do it now

47
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:38,397
Ever wondered...
have you?

48
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,942
Ever wondered...
what's this all about?

49
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:48,240
Ever wondered...?
If you haven't, then do it now

50
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,990
A son tells his father,

51
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:32,409
"Papa, Mummy thinks you're an angel"

52
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,953
The father asks,
"Really, Mummy said that?"

53
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:38,582
The son says,
"She said, you've sprouted wings"

54
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:13,533
Come on, Andy. It's time for bed.
You'll be late for school tomorrow

55
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,790
Come on

56
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:44,147
The flute you used in this song
...it's fantastic!

57
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,195
It'll drive people crazy.
They'll go mad!

58
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,784
Anyway, can I go now, Anu-ji?

59
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,696
Devika asked if we're going to
join them in Alibaug for the weekend

60
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,742
I won't be able to make it.
You should go

61
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,080
She has invited both of us.
Please, come on Adi

62
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,416
It's been over a year
since we went on holiday

63
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,835
I might go to Hong Kong in August

64
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,838
Come along..
If you wish

65
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,601
Good morning, sir

66
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,220
Come

67
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,568
-Who was that?
-Met him in Goa at Singhi's party

68
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,239
Followed me all the way to Bombay

69
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,077
In single-minded pursuit?

70
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,415
Who knows, he might write
a chapter on me

71
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,834
That's creative types for you

72
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,672
Anyway, Aditya and you
are coming to Alibaug, aren't you?

73
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,134
No... Aditya can't come

74
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,096
God! Is he married to you or his job?

75
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,559
Hey, did I say something wrong?

76
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:32,107
I mean... you're neither interested
in what I say, nor in what I design?

77
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,525
Are they so awful?

78
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:41,032
Sometimes when I see you...
I feel jealous

79
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,326
You're living the life you want

80
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:47,122
An interior designer... independent

81
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,749
With writers chasing you
all the way from Goa

82
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,502
You're saying this?

83
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:55,839
You are happily married,
making a home

84
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,551
Remember, it was you who told me,
"I'm happily married"

85
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:04,723
Yes, happily married and...
perhaps a mother soon

86
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,190
Aditya must be jumping with joy...

87
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,569
No... l haven't told him yet

88
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,822
I thought, before l shock him with it,
I'd better confirm with a gynecologist

89
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:24,701
What shock?
Don't you two want a baby?

90
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,163
No, that's not it...

91
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,751
It's just that... only Aditya knows
what he does or doesn't want

92
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,589
When I think of it, it's like
living with a stranger..

93
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,760
..who loves me,
who cares for me..

94
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:46,347
..but I'll never know
what's in his heart and soul

95
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,100
You'll only find stock market quotes

96
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:57,400
I don't know Devika,
maybe I'm just nervous about this baby

97
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,653
Anyway, I'll have to tell him,
sooner or later...

98
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,991
..maybe on his birthday.
-Next week, isn't it?

99
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,036
I want to buy him a gift.

100
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:29,432
-Have you had lunch?
-I've been waiting for you

101
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,227
You remember your promise
... the new tune

102
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,022
But I'll teach it to you, only when you
play the earlier tune without mistakes

103
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,152
Come on, before Mummy goes...

104
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,453
Deliver the goods to Kadam's right now

105
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,832
And come back with the money,
even if you have to wait all day

106
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,502
But get the money today.
Got it? Now go

107
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,048
Leave the goods here.
Come and take your money tomorrow

108
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,925
Madam, l need the money now

109
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:09,597
Why do you hassle me every day? Didn't
I tell you? Come tomorrow at eleven

110
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,433
-Eleven o'clock? -Yes
-For sure? -Yes

111
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,440
-Andy, how was school today?
-Like it is everyday

112
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,442
Funny.
Sit down for lunch

113
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,466
The fisherwomen were here again.
They really hound me

114
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,051
How much they complain!

115
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,929
What do I do?
There's less fish, the rates are lower,.

116
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,140
..the wholesale rate is down.
What profit?

117
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,809
Same old fish again...

118
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:58,563
..every day the same, same food

119
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,523
Sorry Nana, I can't do any better

120
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,484
Doing the accounts all day,
listening to the fisherwomen...

121
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,652
Where's the time to cook?

122
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,987
I mean, just smell my hands, Joe

123
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,822
This goddamn fish smell never goes!

124
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,748
Did Lionel call you back
about that show?

125
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,042
No

126
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,545
Why don't you call him?

127
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:31,930
Joe please, we need the money.
There're endless bills to pay

128
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,349
But no one watches Lionel Uncle's shows.

129
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,309
He doesn't even know how to tune a guitar

130
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:45,610
Playing the guitar there
won't demean you in any way

131
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:51,032
We Mascarenhas' have never done
anything so cheap

132
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,878
Why haven't you sent the necklace set?

133
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,923
You were responsible for the delivery

134
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:11,427
Girish Bhai has called four times today.
What do I say to him?

135
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:14,514
Kedar...?

136
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,561
Do you think,
saying sorry makes it okay?

137
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:25,191
You'll deliver it
personally this evening.

138
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,695
Understood?
Go

139
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,990
Devika, this is perfect

140
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,659
Give me Girish Bhai's package

141
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:44,502
Can you inscribe "Aditya" on the back?
And 22nd July

142
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,304
Aditya, 22nd July?

143
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,473
Why? Can't it be done?

144
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,225
It's not that...

145
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:04,355
Actually, I had a friend, Aditya.
His birthday is also on 22nd July

146
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,649
This Aditya...?

147
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,359
He's my husband

148
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,486
His full name?

149
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,030
Aditya Shroff

150
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,533
Aditya Shroff...

151
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,410
Is he fair and lean..

152
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:20,872
Has long hair, short sighted
but won't wear specs...

153
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,498
and writes wonderful poetry?

154
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,712
Poetry? You're definitely
talking of some other Aditya

155
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,886
I'm sorry, I think I got carried away

156
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,639
It'll be ready by day after... right?

157
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,312
Same name, same birthday...?

158
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,397
-Too much of a coincidence.
-You're right

159
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,988
What's your name?
I'll tell my husband

160
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:59,285
Killer Drummer.
If he's the same Aditya, he'll know

161
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:05,083
Jignesh Bhai, have you ever been unhappy
about your investments with us?

162
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,251
It's a done deal, boss

163
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,296
We manage most of the
foreign investments in the market

164
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,257
We're picking up huge stakes
in the infrastructure sector

165
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,511
Yes... India is booming, sir

166
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,931
Sleep without a care.
Your wealth is in safe hands

167
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,557
Sure

168
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:26,104
My best to your wife.
God be with you

169
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,191
Mr. Bajaj would like to meet you
on the fourteenth floor

170
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,005
The management has decided to
promote you

171
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,252
Why don't we celebrate your
promotion and birthday together?

172
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,007
No, don't bother throwing a party

173
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,260
I'll just take my colleagues
out to lunch tomorrow

174
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:44,348
Whenever you make any plans,
it's with your colleagues

175
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,018
Is your social life
incomplete without them?

176
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,771
Sakshi... that's life

177
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,618
By the way,
a strange thing happened today

178
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,037
Do you know any Killer Drummer?

179
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,631
Do you know a guy called
Killer Drummer?

180
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:24,889
No

181
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,062
Killer Drummer...
strange name, isn't it?

182
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,856
Where did you meet him?

183
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,234
At a jewellery store

184
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,945
Devika needed to buy something
and we were talking about you

185
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:43,574
... and he said he knew an
Aditya Shroff who wrote poetry

186
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,790
And as we spoke, I discovered that
the other Aditya Shroff's birthday...

187
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,875
is also on 22nd July

188
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,877
Strange, isn't it?

189
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,926
Sleep now

190
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:46,512
Sinbad the Sailor sailed away
one day...

191
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:54,145
looking for his... na na na na... way

192
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,567
One minute...

193
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,075
Not quite right?

194
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,620
Shall we try something new, Rob?

195
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,422
KD, you start
and I'll join you on the fourth bar

196
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:32,016
Joe broke the glass

197
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:36,562
Debbie boxed his ears

198
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:42,193
We all laughed
at how you got stuck

199
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,029
And just like that,
Joe left the band

200
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,003
Packed my business cards?
-Yeah

201
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:07,218
Namdeo

202
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,389
Where were you?

203
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,140
Get another bag

204
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,226
Adi, you go on

205
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,644
I'll send your suitcase
to the office

206
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,406
Okay, get another bag from the loft

207
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,494
Wait... I’ll come too

208
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,871
God knows what junk is up there

209
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,333
Take this box out,
give it away

210
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,045
Wait... these too

211
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,009
What's that package up there?
Bring it down

212
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:52,888
Put it here

213
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,349
Open it

214
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,028
Okay, I'll check it

215
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:46,604
I left some papers on the side table.
Please put them away, they're important

216
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,624
So, I was right!

217
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,628
Where is Aditya these days?
What's he doing now?

218
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:14,590
-You should have brought him along.
-He's away in Delhi

219
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,469
I'm planning a surprise party at home
for him on May 22nd

220
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:23,390
If you and the rest of your band
can come, it'll be great

221
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,271
We should've had a reunion
a long time ago

222
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,733
But I had no idea that Aditya
was in Bombay

223
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,069
And it's been ages since
I've spoken to Rob and Joe

224
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,696
Anyway, did Aditya say
anything about us?

225
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,325
No, I was hoping you'd tell me more

226
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,499
-I found these.
-Oh my God!

227
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,545
It's impossible to recognise him

228
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:57,299
And this is you?
You're looking so wild

229
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:01,428
Everything's changed,
my hairstyle most definitely

230
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,144
That's Joe.
Our lead guitarist

231
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,773
Aditya always said,
Joe's fingers made magik

232
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:16,110
Joe said the same
about Aditya's voice

233
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,612
That's why our band was called Magik

234
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,408
Magik?

235
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:26,120
You know, when Aditya arrived in Bombay,
he lived with Joe for three months

236
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,209
Rob, he is our band's backbone

237
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,753
He did all the programming
and the bass sections

238
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:41,552
I'm sure you know this poet

239
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:47,099
Suddenly, one day he says,
"Let's go to Goa"

240
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,143
No packing, nothing.
Just go

241
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,395
And we just set off

242
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:59,027
Aditya's dream, was that Magik would have
a tour bus and we'd just head off

243
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,572
There'd be no turning back

244
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:07,411
And all of us believed
it would turn out exactly like that

245
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:13,375
In our twenties, we think
the world will dance to our tune

246
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,672
Sorry, I'm boring you with all this talk

247
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:21,633
No. You've told me so much.
Thanks

248
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,679
I'll talk to Rob and Joe.
I can't guarantee they'll come

249
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:29,183
But I'll definitely come.
-Please try and bring them

250
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:42,529
What was it 241 2 3489 or 59?

251
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,212
It takes you so long
to pick up the phone?

252
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,261
Yes

253
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:11,767
-Where are you?
-When can you meet me?

254
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:16,230
-Just tell me where.
-Jazz by the bay. Nine thirty

255
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,772
KD, turn down the volume

256
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,876
That was my friend from Channel V.
I styled some of his shows

257
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,961
He called with some special news

258
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,338
-You're really lucky
-Shut up, KD

259
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,299
There's going to be a contest

260
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:29,595
The winning band gets to cut an album
and make a music video

261
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,352
We'll need new equipment

262
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:42,232
Good cymbals for KD.
A new mike for you, Adi

263
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,985
You need a new distortion pedal

264
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,987
And for me, another tea

265
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,114
Uncle Khursheed, one more tea

266
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,993
In all, we'll need about
fifty five thousand

267
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,870
The band's savings are
twenty thousand

268
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,539
Maybe I can wangle five thousand from dad

269
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,541
That makes twenty five thousand.
Which leaves...

270
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,502
Thirty thousand.
Einstein!

271
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,671
I have some cash...

272
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,090
..about three or four thousand...
-Really?

273
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,009
I can give you that

274
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,844
I've got about the same

275
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,013
Adi, can't you ask your Dad?

276
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,351
He won't give it. I know

277
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,853
Punishing me for not doing an MBA

278
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,229
Dads...

279
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,860
There's a way out.
Raghav Yedekar

280
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,862
Sounds like a goon...

281
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:32,574
He organizes shows.
Music from old films

282
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:36,078
Totally different from our music
The audience is different too

283
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,163
Old film music?

284
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:42,918
We'll need a sitar, harmonium, ten tabalas!
Guitars and keyboards won't do

285
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,379
Really Rob, I can't do it either

286
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,797
Hang on, Joe

287
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,635
Who says we can't play old songs
on guitars and drums?

288
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,889
We'll choose our songs
and do them in our style

289
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,141
With the Magik touch

290
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:15,409
Like breath is needed...

291
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:22,958
Like breath is needed for life

292
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:26,837
Yes, a sweetheart is needed,

293
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,965
for love

294
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,762
Like a flame is needed,

295
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:43,687
Like a flame is needed,
for light

296
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:47,482
Yes, a sweetheart is needed,

297
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,652
for love

298
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,748
This day comes,
in the season of youth

299
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:06,251
When eyes meet eyes,
even water catches fire

300
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:12,674
This day comes,
in the season of youth

301
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,680
I'm going to take you high, my baby

302
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,807
Fly with me

303
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:33,820
Fly high

304
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,415
So, Aditya doesn't know about the party?

305
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,918
That's what a surprise is all about

306
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,922
Let's see how he takes the surprise

307
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,132
-I'm in.
-Good

308
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,301
So what other news...?

309
00:34:56,594 --> 00:35:01,098
Saw an ad on TV some time ago,
the music sounded like yours

310
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:05,977
You're really lucky, Rob

311
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,855
Still making music after all these years

312
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,441
Don't know how to do anything else, KD

313
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,987
And you? Still drumming?

314
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,951
I don't remember the last time
I touched drumsticks

315
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,872
But now you can afford
the world's best drum kit

316
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,874
Yes, I can

317
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:33,213
-And l don't even have to go to
a Dandiya-dance. -Dandiya?

318
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,135
Yeah! We bought equipment out of
our performance at the Dandiya!

319
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:59,406
How can I tell you...
what my heart says

320
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,326
You'd think, maybe I'm insane

321
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:16,506
How can I tell you
what my heart says

322
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:20,427
You'd think, maybe I'm insane

323
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,015
I want to get to the
top of the TV tower

324
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:28,852
Scream out loud and say...

325
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:33,648
Rock On!
It's the sign of the times

326
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:37,444
Rock On!
Every moment beckons

327
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:42,199
Rock On!
What are you waiting for

328
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:48,622
Rock On!
You only live once

329
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:59,049
My heart tells me...
to scream out loud

330
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:02,594
Everyone.. should open their windows

331
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:07,599
Then I'll sing them my spirited songs

332
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:11,436
Let them join in and raise the cry

333
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:16,107
Rock On!
It's the sign of the times

334
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:20,237
Rock On!
Every moment beckons

335
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:24,699
Rock On!
What are you waiting for

336
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:29,496
Rock On!
You only live once

337
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:19,963
Just live your life...
the way you always wanted to

338
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:24,259
All I've got to say is...

339
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:30,390
make every single one
of your dreams come true!

340
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,285
Welcome to Channel V's Launchpad

341
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:53,413
From Bangalore, this is Chakravyuh

342
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:02,589
The world's full of snakes

343
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:09,471
They bite everyone

344
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:16,061
Sitting upon their coils

345
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:19,356
Hood outstretched

346
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:23,193
Snakes hiss

347
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,948
Toxic

348
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:32,285
Blacks, blues, yellows

349
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,663
Eyes of stone...

350
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:40,210
and sharp fangs

351
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:51,805
The world
is a jungle of snakes

352
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:58,728
There's a hood in every face

353
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:04,234
Sitting upon their coils,

354
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,237
hood outstretched,

355
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:11,241
hissing, waiting to strike

356
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:16,871
Toxic!

357
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:20,250
Blacks, blues, yellows

358
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,044
Eyes of stone...

359
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:28,174
and sharp fangs

360
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:54,033
All right! Let's hear it for Chakravyuh

361
00:40:55,995 --> 00:41:00,582
Now, our next band,
from right here in Bombay

362
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:04,002
Fans say, there's magik in their music

363
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:07,213
Bombay, are you ready for them?

364
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,049
That's more like it

365
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,636
Let's welcome on stage, Magik

366
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,247
I need your help for the next song

367
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,333
Will you sing with me?

368
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:04,354
Put your hands together

369
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:09,192
Everybody, sing with me

370
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,010
Way to go

371
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:42,141
Now... sing when I raise my hand

372
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:02,161
One of my laundry bills...
An unfinished novel...

373
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:11,254
A girl's phone number...
A useful piece of paper...

374
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:19,512
In my deck, a king of hearts...

375
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:24,017
And one of my silver rings...

376
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:29,355
When I look at
what I lost this last week

377
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:33,359
Some days I laughed at myself
and some days I cried

378
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:56,549
One of my laundry bills
An unfinished novel

379
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:05,642
A girl's phone number
A useful piece of paper

380
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:13,941
In my deck, a king of hearts

381
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:18,404
And one of my silver rings

382
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:23,826
When I look at
what I lost this last week

383
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:27,997
Some days I laughed at myself
Some days I cried

384
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:41,886
I got a gift, a watch...
that I loved so much

385
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:50,978
A packet of Mary Jane
My old denim jacket

386
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:58,778
Two passes for a cricket match

387
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:03,950
My brand new sunglasses

388
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:09,122
When I look at
what I lost this last week

389
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:13,334
Some days I laughed at myself
and some days I cried

390
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:27,306
How...
do I forget?

391
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:32,145
On day seven, someone introduced you
to me at a party

392
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:39,986
What was in the moment...
when I saw you for the first time

393
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:44,532
When we first met...

394
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:49,162
I felt what love was

395
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:54,500
I lost my senses...
and my heart too

396
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:58,629
Some days I laughed at myself
and some days I cried

397
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:03,342
That was everything I lost
this last week

398
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,521
Put your hands together

399
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:44,300
One of my laundry bills
An unfinished novel

400
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:53,434
A girl's phone number
A useful piece of paper

401
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:02,360
One of my laundry bills
An unfinished novel

402
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:11,452
A girl's phone number
A useful piece of paper

403
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:19,794
When I met you first

404
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:24,298
I felt.. what love was

405
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:29,679
I lost my senses and
my heart too

406
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:33,933
Some days I laughed at myself
and some days I cried

407
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:50,283
Now's the time to find out
who the winner of the contest is

408
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,787
The winners get an album contract.

409
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:59,292
And at least one music video

410
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,671
I'm all nerves

411
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,298
Can you tell...

412
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:09,260
..which lucky band's name
is in this envelope?

413
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:12,346
Magik

414
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,019
Picture this...

415
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:04,023
Someone insults Aditya
and Joe breaks out in a rash

416
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,150
And now...

417
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,281
Where's Joe these days?

418
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,409
Ran into him some months ago,
at Purple Haze Studio

419
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:20,206
He has so much talent,
but business sense... zero

420
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:25,211
Joe... when will he learn
it's important to market oneself?

421
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,548
Let's go meet him

422
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,969
It'll be great if you invite him
to Aditya's party

423
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:36,013
No, don't try to use me to do this

424
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:40,601
Come on Rob, you always knew
how to handle them

425
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,230
I mean, that was why
we tolerated you in the band

426
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:55,533
Anybody in?

427
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:02,289
-Oh my God... -KD?
-Wow... Joe!

428
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:09,839
How are you?

429
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,183
How're you doing?

430
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:22,935
All okay?

431
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:24,478
Getting along

432
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:26,897
I teach guitar to kids
in the neighbourhood

433
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:30,234
And once in a while,
I perform live at a club

434
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:32,903
-It's all good, man
-Good?

435
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:36,240
You're still performing on stage!
That's fantastic, Joe

436
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:40,036
It's nothing like those concerts

437
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:44,457
Here, people hang around,
party, talk, drink

438
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,043
What I'm playing makes
no difference to them

439
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:51,881
I played in a club once

440
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:54,884
I got so angry, felt like
hurling my keyboard at the crowd

441
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:56,802
You should have

442
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,221
That way your keyboard
would've been of some use

443
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:09,482
Did you know Aditya is also here
in Bombay

444
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:12,693
Really...?

445
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:15,321
No... how would I know?

446
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:20,076
His wife came to my store

447
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:21,577
And...

448
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,246
She has invited us home

449
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:25,748
For Aditya's birthday party

450
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:28,959
22nd...?

451
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,339
Look who's here

452
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,679
-Who's this?
-Andrew

453
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,562
Magik's drummer?

454
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,734
-How old is he?
-He'll turn eight this year

455
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,197
Debbie, I'll hand it to you!

456
00:51:58,323 --> 00:52:00,616
You don't look like the mother
of an eight year old

457
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,953
But in that outfit, you look
like a typical businessman

458
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,457
Even Rob looks different
in his close crop, doesn't he?

459
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,085
Long hair is no longer in fashion

460
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,796
You're saying this?

461
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:17,133
Someone who'd brush his hair
before brushing his teeth!

462
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:19,426
Why don't you just admit it,
you're losing your hair

463
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:24,181
Show me how you'd flick the
sticks in the air and catch them

464
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:27,977
-Hey, who told you?
-Who else?

465
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:31,647
At bedtime, Andy listens to
only one story. Magik's

466
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:38,863
Debbie, we're planning a reunion.
Next week. At Aditya's

467
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:41,615
Why don't you join us
and bring Andrew along

468
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,409
Reunion?

469
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:48,372
So the two of you are here with
a message from Aditya, the star?

470
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,333
It's not like that, Debbie

471
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:56,589
All these years you weren't
even in touch. Why now?

472
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:13,522
Debbie is really stressed out
because of work

473
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:15,232
She doesn't mean it, you know that

474
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:23,032
Next time, I'll show you
the magik of drumsticks

475
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,204
Say bye, Andy

476
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:39,548
It'll be good if you guys come.
Think about it. Okay?

477
00:53:56,566 --> 00:54:00,319
They come around after years,
that too with an invite from Aditya

478
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:03,697
If it was so important,
couldn't he have phoned himself?

479
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:08,452
It's a surprise party, Debbie.
His wife is organizing it

480
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,790
Keep away from them

481
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:15,125
Being with them was
always bad for you

482
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,253
Last time, you got hurt

483
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,921
God knows what they want now!

484
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:21,924
Nobody hurt me

485
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:23,926
I was the one who quit

486
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,679
You're defending them now?

487
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,140
So they call and you go,
tail wagging?

488
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,684
Is that right?

489
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:37,898
No, Debbie

490
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,734
I'll wear a collar and
stay right by you.

491
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,701
You think that I...?

492
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:53,455
Do whatever you want

493
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:48,927
Listen, you better tell the music company
that I'm styling Magik's video

494
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:53,223
Or you'll end up wearing
these shorts and a T-shirt

495
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:55,267
What's wrong with my shorts?

496
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:58,354
Showing my legs only adds
to the sex appeal of the video

497
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:07,696
This is our big break

498
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,574
Our lottery ticket to the future

499
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:13,660
Now we have to get the right numbers

500
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:21,668
When you're around...
I feel like...

501
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:26,673
I've found every joy

502
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,884
When you're gone...

503
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,220
It feels like...

504
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:36,141
every joy has faded

505
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:39,895
You’re the one...

506
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:44,149
my life needs

507
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,379
You're a poet
and we didn't even know it

508
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,089
It's a great tune

509
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:11,844
We need another song for the album
and l think we've found it

510
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:13,262
Yes, Adi?

511
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,641
I want to dedicate it to Debbie

512
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,644
It'll be your wedding anthem

513
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:22,771
When it's played in church,
all will rise

514
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:38,162
Tell me seriously,
what do you think of the song?

515
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:49,882
And when you sing it in your style,
it'll be even better

516
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,302
Thanks, brother

517
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,439
Adi...

518
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,067
When we meet the music company guys,

519
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:13,447
make sure you tell them
about Debbie styling our music video

520
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,449
You could tell them yourself

521
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:18,452
Yeah, but she's my girlfriend and...

522
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,580
it'll be a little odd

523
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:23,916
You'll tell them, won't you?

524
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:26,335
Of course, I will

525
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:10,712
Here's your gift

526
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:19,221
There's another surprise for you

527
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,153
We're not ghosts

528
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:45,414
I'll join you

529
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,430
Just... take care of them

530
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:18,280
Thanks for coming.
I'm glad you came

531
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:20,574
Aditya is happy too, of course

532
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,371
He's forever busy with work

533
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,582
I hope you're fine?

534
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,292
Yes, we're good

535
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:32,711
Your drink...?
-I'm fine, thank you

536
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:59,821
Your friends are getting bored

537
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:02,908
What do I do?
We have other guests as well

538
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:09,831
All right, I'm going

539
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:24,346
When did you pick up this habit?

540
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:26,098
Well...

541
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:29,768
Cigarettes are rotten for your voice

542
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:34,106
What does my voice have to do
with investment banking?

543
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:39,277
Remember losing your voice
before a show once, in college...

544
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:43,365
and Debbie forcing you to drink
that re-mixed herbal tonic

545
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:45,659
I'll never forget your face

546
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:51,707
Whatever it was, it was effective

547
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:55,460
She also gave you some medicine
to improve memory, didn't she?

548
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:56,962
Didn't help, did it?

549
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:58,296
What do you mean?

550
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,966
I still remember, she was the one

551
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:08,682
Joe didn't come?
-Must be on his way...

552
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:11,393
Why don't you call him and
check where he is?

553
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:27,409
Obviously, Sakshi doesn't know
much about Magik

554
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,412
Never felt the need to tell her

555
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:35,709
sometimes, it feels as if
it all happened in another lifetime...

556
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,169
and sometimes as if, just yesterday

557
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:42,174
Why don't we get together again
at our old rehearsal pad?

558
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,092
Sounds like a great idea

559
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,261
Tomorrow's Sunday.
Let's do it

560
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:48,013
But first, we'll meet at Army Cafe

561
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,433
Come off it

562
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:54,936
One o'clock?

563
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,609
Come on. Rob, you, me...
even Joe will turn up

564
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:03,028
The four of us, together again

565
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,449
Why do we need four?

566
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,743
Even two or three can jam together

567
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:12,454
But it won't be Magik

568
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:35,477
I wish your friend Joe had come

569
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:45,487
How did you like meeting your friends?

570
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:49,783
Sakshi, you shouldn't have invited them

571
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:52,410
Why?

572
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:57,791
Why did you tell me that
you didn't know them?

573
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:01,002
Because I don't know them anymore

574
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:04,798
We have drifted apart

575
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:08,677
You saw it too...
how uncomfortable they were

576
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,430
They were our guests

577
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:16,518
And guests feel as comfortable
as we make them

578
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:20,939
I felt you were the uncomfortable one

579
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:24,109
Why are you getting involved
in these things?

580
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:26,278
Just let it be

581
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:10,572
Look...

582
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:13,158
Isn't that you?

583
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:20,165
I thought that if you met your
friends again, you'd feel good

584
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:24,085
Maybe, it would bring back this smile

585
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:28,590
Why are you spying?

586
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,092
Spying?

587
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:34,346
I want to see you happy

588
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,181
By going through my things?

589
01:05:36,515 --> 01:05:38,350
Stop it! What's come over you?

590
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:40,894
Look at yourself! What you were,
what you've become?

591
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,104
In ten years, people change

592
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:45,899
I'm not the Aditya you see
in these pictures

593
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:51,279
You're right...
the man in these pictures is happy

594
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:53,615
I'm happy even today

595
01:05:57,036 --> 01:06:00,538
If you're happy,
then why don't l feel it?

596
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:03,708
Why does it feel like you're
living a mechanical life?

597
01:06:03,876 --> 01:06:06,294
Now you have a problem with my life?

598
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:09,923
Not I.
You have a problem with your life

599
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:12,217
That's why you keep me at a distance

600
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:18,139
Why do you feel so bad about
me seeing these pictures?

601
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:23,395
These pictures mean nothing

602
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,730
Then why have you kept them
so carefully?

603
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:30,235
-You could have thrown them away
or burnt them. -Is that it?

604
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,988
Destroy them.
Makes no difference to me

605
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:35,657
I cut these ties a long time ago

606
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:38,785
Maybe you lost a lot
when you cut these ties?

607
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:41,663
-Have you thought of that?
-What have l lost?

608
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:43,999
Only you know that

609
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,959
If something's disturbing you...

610
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,837
Damn it, Sakshi!
Think what you want

611
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,674
Ten years ago, I chose this life

612
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:56,845
Yes, I made some compromises...
but who doesn't?

613
01:06:57,263 --> 01:07:01,766
Am I one of the compromises in your life?

614
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:04,269
Is our marriage also a compromise?

615
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:08,773
-That's not what I meant...
-That's exactly what it is, Aditya

616
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:11,026
Don't you see, you're angry with yourself

617
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:14,029
And your anger is
hurting our relationship

618
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:16,698
I want to be a part of your life

619
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:19,993
But how is it possible when
you're living only half a life!

620
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:27,292
And to make my life complete,
you invited them here?

621
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:30,879
I made a mistake

622
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:34,883
I thought you'd be happy
to meet your friends

623
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:39,304
And then I was going to tell you
that you're going to be a father

624
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:42,223
What?

625
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:46,728
Yes Aditya. But what a pity...

626
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:51,649
Now I don't even know,
if hearing this makes you happy or not

627
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,766
"I'm going to Mum's house."

628
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,935
"I need time to think."

629
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:07,619
Hello, Nana

630
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:11,456
I knew I'd find you here

631
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,542
Why didn't you come yesterday?

632
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:16,544
You know why

633
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,631
No Joe, I don't know

634
01:10:21,133 --> 01:10:25,053
Look, whatever happened ten years ago
affected all our lives

635
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:28,806
The difference is, KD and I accepted it

636
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:30,808
But you couldn't

637
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:33,394
And guess what, nor has Aditya

638
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:37,815
Success, failure...
these things come and go

639
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:44,197
We got together to fulfill our dream,
our passion to create music

640
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,200
But you forgot that

641
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:49,911
Being successful was most
important for you

642
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:52,664
Isn't success important?

643
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:56,918
Don't you see that your success
lay in Magik's success?

644
01:10:57,169 --> 01:11:01,256
Imagine, where we'd all be today
if all that hadn't happened

645
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,840
What do you want from me?

646
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:05,426
What can I do now?

647
01:11:06,178 --> 01:11:08,096
We're meeting today.

648
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:11,849
One o'clock, at Uncle Khursheed's cafe

649
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:16,229
Life doesn't give everyone
a second chance

650
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:19,232
One o'clock.
See you there

651
01:11:48,053 --> 01:11:50,722
Clean up table number two.
-All right

652
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:54,809
Uncle Khursheed...

653
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:58,896
Recognise me?

654
01:12:01,233 --> 01:12:02,150
No

655
01:12:04,903 --> 01:12:06,654
One tea, please

656
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:09,407
Dilip, one tea

657
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:23,504
Thank you

658
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:48,029
Did Adi have to be
late today of all days?

659
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:51,324
-There
-Sorry I'm late, guys

660
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:53,951
Come on... only two minutes left

661
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:56,329
Breathe, man

662
01:12:56,955 --> 01:12:59,332
Don't forget to tell them about Debbie

663
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:02,460
-Don't forget man, it's really important
-I won't forget, Joe

664
01:13:03,128 --> 01:13:05,213
Please! Don't make me more nervous.
Come on

665
01:13:05,297 --> 01:13:06,214
Okay

666
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:09,133
So how do you feel?

667
01:13:09,968 --> 01:13:13,554
We're confident. Just show us
the way to the recording studio

668
01:13:17,976 --> 01:13:23,064
Look kids... just recording the music
doesn't make it a hit

669
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,900
Music must cater to public taste

670
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:30,988
But... you liked our music, didn't you?

671
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:32,240
It's good...

672
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:38,371
But could be better...
much, much, much better

673
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:42,375
A popular number

674
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:50,091
I'll get it from you, of course

675
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:54,512
October to January is
the wedding season, right?

676
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:57,932
Let's take a hit wedding song...

677
01:13:58,016 --> 01:14:00,101
and do a rock remix

678
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:01,686
But...

679
01:14:02,187 --> 01:14:05,022
a wedding remix in a rock album...?

680
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:09,110
Why... is it against the law to do that?

681
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,406
Everything goes

682
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:16,868
The main thing is,
the album should be a hit

683
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:21,205
We'll take the slow song out...
it won't work

684
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:25,626
You know, the one which goes,

685
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:27,420
"If you're there, I'm here or not here..."

686
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:32,216
It's the only soft, romantic ballad
that gives our album some depth

687
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,719
Nowadays this doesn't sell, kid

688
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:39,056
Tempo... give me tempo

689
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:43,060
Today's youth want songs with tempo,
bubbly stuff

690
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:48,065
If you agree with what I'm saying...

691
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:49,901
Here's the contract

692
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:55,448
You see boys...

693
01:14:56,909 --> 01:15:01,329
In life, one needs to make
some compromises

694
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:06,167
Seven out of eight songs
are of your choice

695
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:07,502
And one...

696
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,086
that I want

697
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:16,469
Besides, there's no dearth of
talent in the market

698
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,547
Well done. Congratulations

699
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:37,008
Another thing.

700
01:16:37,092 --> 01:16:40,595
We have a friend, Debbie.
She does costumes and styling

701
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:43,764
We were hoping, you could use her
for our music video

702
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:47,560
Relax! Now you're the
responsibility of this company

703
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:49,103
Forget all these people

704
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:52,356
At least meet her once

705
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:57,570
You get to work in the recording studio
and let us do our work

706
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:06,120
I feel terrible about Joe's
song being rejected

707
01:17:06,204 --> 01:17:08,539
It's not just about my song

708
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:13,794
It's our debut album

709
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:17,298
To push a stupid remix into it...

710
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:20,051
I think we're making
a very big compromise

711
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:23,220
In that case, we shouldn't have signed

712
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:29,435
But now that we have, there's really
no point in talking about it

713
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:36,651
If we hadn't done it,
someone else would have

714
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:42,406
I'm so sorry about your song, Joe.

715
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:46,827
No. I'm sorry, Debbie
They won't let you do the styling

716
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:49,497
They say, they already have someone

717
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:54,085
But they haven't even seen her work!

718
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:03,427
Seven out of eight songs selected.
It's not that bad

719
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:07,181
Unfortunately, we need them now

720
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:10,935
Once this album is a hit,
we'll be free to do whatever we want

721
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:18,109
You're about to record your first album.

722
01:18:18,443 --> 01:18:20,111
What more do we want?

723
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:53,144
Sweetheart, it leaves me cold

724
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:55,980
Do something, darling

725
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:06,741
So why don't you tell me what to play.
I'll do as you say

726
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:07,908
Go on

727
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:24,925
Mr. Sukhani...

728
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:29,346
Have you worked on a lot of albums?

729
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:30,765
Boss, l tell you...

730
01:19:30,849 --> 01:19:33,726
the Subhash Ghai film Karz,
starring Rishi Kapoor...

731
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:11,472
All of you, out

732
01:20:11,556 --> 01:20:13,474
Now, Aditya's close ups

733
01:20:18,396 --> 01:20:22,483
Your shot's done?
But you just went in...

734
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:26,779
Aditya's close ups again

735
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:33,661
We look like clowns in these clothes.
Why couldn't they let you style us?

736
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:36,664
And this director...
keeps asking me to jump

737
01:20:36,748 --> 01:20:38,916
If I keep jumping,
when will I play the keyboards?

738
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:42,002
Aditya, take a break.

739
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:57,017
What's the matter?

740
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:59,520
You'd see what the matter is Aditya...

741
01:20:59,604 --> 01:21:02,022
if you'd only take off
your rock star shades

742
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:09,280
What... maybe you didn't notice?
The director's focusing only on you

743
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:12,449
The three of us are in the background,
like sidekicks

744
01:21:13,451 --> 01:21:15,119
That too in these costumes.

745
01:21:15,453 --> 01:21:18,706
-Do we look like a rock band?
-Do you think I’m happy in these clothes?

746
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:19,874
Drop it, Joe

747
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:22,835
Aditya is our lead singer
he has to be the focus

748
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:25,296
Whatever's happening here, isn't right

749
01:21:27,632 --> 01:21:29,884
No one takes over in Magik!

750
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:31,886
Remember? Your words

751
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:34,722
One chance at getting famous
and you forget all your principles

752
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:38,851
Let's talk in the make-up room.
Come on, please

753
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:46,901
You think I knew this would happen
when we signed the contract?

754
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:49,570
But I'm a professional, Joe.
Maybe you should try to be one

755
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,241
You've sold out

756
01:21:54,326 --> 01:21:58,412
That director was treating us so badly.
Did you stop him even once?

757
01:21:58,496 --> 01:22:01,248
Hello... what's going on here?

758
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:03,083
This studio doesn't come for free

759
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:06,003
We need a short break.
We've got something to discuss

760
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:09,381
Discussions later, darling.
The shoot is held up

761
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:11,592
-Come on guys.
-Please go away

762
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:15,763
I said, please go away

763
01:22:17,682 --> 01:22:18,891
Darling

764
01:22:19,017 --> 01:22:21,518
Keep this attitude of yours at home

765
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:25,981
You signed a contract,
you'll do as l say

766
01:22:26,066 --> 01:22:28,359
Got it? Come on, darling

767
01:22:29,527 --> 01:22:31,362
Joe! Have you gone mad?

768
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:35,950
Blood! It's blood!

769
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:38,202
Get lost!
I don't want to know!

770
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:40,120
Damn your album!

771
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:42,539
Magik is finished!
Pack up!

772
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:46,043
I'll make sure you're finished!

773
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:47,044
I am Sukhani!

774
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:48,796
To hell with your contract...

775
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:50,923
I quit

776
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:18,409
After all these years...

777
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:20,411
nothing's changed here.

778
01:23:20,578 --> 01:23:21,954
It's been a long time

779
01:23:22,956 --> 01:23:24,498
Joe?

780
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:28,752
You're here after ages! All okay?

781
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:30,587
Fine, Uncle Khursheed. How are you?

782
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:32,006
I'm great, perfect

783
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:33,674
A tea, please.
-Sure

784
01:23:33,758 --> 01:23:35,426
Prepare a nice tea and bring for him.

785
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:38,971
What a sharp memory.
So long, and he still hasn't forgotten

786
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:42,850
It's the guitar.
You carry it everywhere

787
01:23:42,934 --> 01:23:44,685
So it stays in the mind

788
01:23:47,772 --> 01:23:48,981
Are they coming?

789
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:56,196
Bloody hell, man

790
01:23:58,533 --> 01:24:00,284
Your jeep is still alive?

791
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:03,203
Of course. Together, in life and death!

792
01:24:04,622 --> 01:24:06,999
Was that too much?

793
01:24:07,792 --> 01:24:09,293
When did you get here?

794
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:11,879
Ten minutes ago

795
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:14,882
-Where's Adi? Should I
call him? -No, KD

796
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:17,634
He'll come if he wants to

797
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:22,473
I don't really understand what happened

798
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:28,020
Everything was perfect and then suddenly,
it just all went wrong?

799
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:33,734
Perhaps you never noticed
that something was troubling her?

800
01:24:34,986 --> 01:24:36,737
Notice what?

801
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:39,239
What does she have to
complain about me?

802
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:43,243
For four years,
we've shared everything...

803
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:46,080
-What more can I do?
-Lots

804
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:54,922
You may have been sharing a home
But you aren't sharing your lives

805
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:57,758
Sakshi still feels
that you're a stranger..

806
01:24:57,842 --> 01:25:01,512
..about whom she knows nothing

807
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:07,059
And her feelings got stronger
when she discovered those photographs

808
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:16,443
It's been ten years

809
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:18,779
When will it stop chasing me?

810
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:22,366
When you stop running

811
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:32,292
I guess we should go

812
01:25:34,045 --> 01:25:35,796
Did you really think he'd come?

813
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:54,875
Shall we try something?

814
01:26:56,127 --> 01:26:57,044
Sure

815
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:10,474
Shall we begin?

816
01:27:13,144 --> 01:27:15,395
One of my laundry bills...

817
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:18,065
An unfinished novel...

818
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:24,821
A girl's phone number...

819
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:27,658
A useful piece of paper...

820
01:27:31,412 --> 01:27:32,913
In my deck,

821
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:36,208
a king of hearts

822
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:43,590
And one of my silver rings...

823
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:45,759
When I... this last...

824
01:27:46,427 --> 01:27:48,929
The right pitch is two notes higher

825
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:55,352
Is that so?

826
01:27:55,436 --> 01:27:56,937
Why don't you show us?

827
01:28:10,451 --> 01:28:12,869
One of my laundry bills...

828
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:15,539
An unfinished novel...

829
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:22,713
A girl's phone number...

830
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:25,465
A useful piece of paper...

831
01:28:31,222 --> 01:28:34,308
In my deck, a king of hearts...

832
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:39,146
And one of my silver rings...

833
01:28:39,397 --> 01:28:44,901
When I look at
what I lost this last week

834
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:49,489
Some days I laughed at myself
and some days I cried

835
01:29:13,765 --> 01:29:15,932
Sorry, I couldn't make it
to your party last night

836
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:29,029
Let's not get too sentimental

837
01:29:32,116 --> 01:29:34,701
But not here.
Look at the state of this place

838
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:37,788
Why?

839
01:29:37,872 --> 01:29:39,373
Too used to air-conditioning now?

840
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:43,794
You've lost your hair,
what difference will it make to you?

841
01:29:43,961 --> 01:29:47,047
Guys... let's go to my place

842
01:30:19,163 --> 01:30:22,249
Anyone coming to help?
I'm not twenty five any more

843
01:30:45,523 --> 01:30:48,275
You were right, I am upset with life

844
01:30:49,277 --> 01:30:52,112
But if you're going to
ignore me like this,..

845
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:55,031
..my relationship with
life will only get worse

846
01:30:56,701 --> 01:31:00,120
You were right.
I've been living only half a life

847
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:05,125
But if you leave like this,
even that half-a-life will be no more

848
01:31:06,210 --> 01:31:09,129
Yes you're right,
I keep you at a distance

849
01:31:11,799 --> 01:31:14,134
But today the distance is so wide that...

850
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:17,554
I'm talking to your answering machine
and not to you

851
01:31:17,805 --> 01:31:19,306
I never thought this would happen

852
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:23,310
Please come home, Sakshi

853
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:44,915
Good afternoon, sir

854
01:31:44,999 --> 01:31:47,334
How are you, Bahadur?
-Fine, sir

855
01:31:49,253 --> 01:31:50,337
Put it down here

856
01:31:53,007 --> 01:31:56,092
Namdeo, get the extension board as well

857
01:31:57,512 --> 01:32:00,931
-Adi... here?
-Yes

858
01:32:03,601 --> 01:32:06,686
I mean, everything looks so perfect here

859
01:32:07,104 --> 01:32:08,271
Adi, are you allowed?

860
01:32:08,356 --> 01:32:11,274
KD... this is my home

861
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:31,127
Thank you for coming to
Magik Re-united's first concert

862
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:35,507
On lead guitar, we have Joe.
Nowadays, he attends very few parties

863
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,227
Down there...
-Okay

864
01:32:47,728 --> 01:32:52,315
Our conversations...
I wish, they go on forever

865
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:56,653
Our sweet meetings...
I hope, they go on forever

866
01:32:56,737 --> 01:32:57,571
Remember?

867
01:32:57,655 --> 01:33:00,490
Of course, but we never finished
composing it. Let's try?

868
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:04,744
One moment... Rob

869
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:11,334
-Remember Sindbad the Sailor?
-Yes

870
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:12,711
Scale?

871
01:33:20,177 --> 01:33:30,562
In conversations,
we'll find new words of love

872
01:33:30,605 --> 01:33:35,567
Then, with those words...

873
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:40,947
we'll write a song

874
01:33:41,782 --> 01:33:43,033
A song...

875
01:33:44,118 --> 01:33:49,456
that fills hearts...
all hearts...

876
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:52,459
with love

877
01:33:52,543 --> 01:34:01,384
Let our words...
become songs

878
01:34:03,304 --> 01:34:10,894
And let the words...
melt into tunes

879
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:15,982
I didn't know you had
so much hidden talent

880
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:20,320
There's a hotshot producer here.
Meet him today

881
01:34:21,906 --> 01:34:25,075
Sorry, not today.
Some other time

882
01:34:25,159 --> 01:34:27,160
I have to leave, it's urgent

883
01:34:27,244 --> 01:34:29,245
-Are you sure?
-Yes

884
01:34:57,942 --> 01:35:03,113
To turn sorrow into joy,

885
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:08,785
sing that song of love

886
01:35:08,869 --> 01:35:12,872
And anyone who hears
our song will say...

887
01:35:12,957 --> 01:35:16,543
Sing again

888
01:35:18,879 --> 01:35:23,466
Our conversations...

889
01:35:23,551 --> 01:35:29,389
I wish, they go on forever

890
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:34,227
Our sweet meetings

891
01:35:34,311 --> 01:35:40,483
I hope, they go on forever

892
01:35:40,568 --> 01:35:45,488
For all our days and nights...
forever

893
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:49,409
In conversations,

894
01:35:51,328 --> 01:36:00,503
we'll find new words of love

895
01:36:01,672 --> 01:36:07,010
Then, with those words...

896
01:36:07,094 --> 01:36:12,515
we'll write a song

897
01:36:12,850 --> 01:36:14,934
A song...

898
01:36:15,269 --> 01:36:17,437
that fills hearts...

899
01:36:17,521 --> 01:36:20,982
all hearts...

900
01:36:21,066 --> 01:36:23,610
with love

901
01:36:23,694 --> 01:36:32,744
Let our words...
become songs

902
01:36:34,538 --> 01:36:37,123
And let words...

903
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:43,463
in our conversations...
melt into tunes

904
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:10,824
Here. That settles your account

905
01:37:16,705 --> 01:37:19,666
Where are you going?
You have to pick up Andrew from school

906
01:37:21,961 --> 01:37:25,004
Will you pick him up today, please?

907
01:37:26,173 --> 01:37:29,509
What's happening?
You've been staying out all day

908
01:37:31,470 --> 01:37:33,012
I was...

909
01:37:34,348 --> 01:37:36,724
going to the studio...
I might land some work

910
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:38,268
Studio?

911
01:37:38,727 --> 01:37:42,856
Purple Haze, in Bandra.
Rob has fixed some meetings

912
01:37:42,982 --> 01:37:44,858
Oh... oh really?

913
01:37:45,276 --> 01:37:49,612
You keep saying that
I ought to look for work

914
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:53,741
So, in the past few weeks I've
been doing the rounds of studios

915
01:37:56,245 --> 01:37:57,954
Okay... fine

916
01:37:59,748 --> 01:38:01,624
Okay... bye

917
01:38:04,169 --> 01:38:05,295
I'm on, Rob

918
01:38:05,379 --> 01:38:07,297
Hi guys...
-Hey, Joe

919
01:38:07,506 --> 01:38:12,051
Hi Joe! Look, channel V's talent hunt
is up next month, on the 24th

920
01:38:12,177 --> 01:38:14,012
Winners get an album contract

921
01:38:16,390 --> 01:38:18,516
What do you say?
Should we enter?

922
01:38:21,061 --> 01:38:22,312
One minute

923
01:38:22,479 --> 01:38:27,066
Jamming indoors is one thing,
performing on stage is quite another

924
01:38:27,484 --> 01:38:32,155
After all these years,
can we perform on stage?

925
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:33,531
Why not?

926
01:38:33,866 --> 01:38:36,117
What's time got to do with rock and roll?

927
01:38:36,869 --> 01:38:42,540
KD, I know you so well.
You'll do all this, just to impress girls

928
01:38:44,251 --> 01:38:47,879
Sakshi, if it impresses
your friend Devika...

929
01:38:48,005 --> 01:38:49,380
I have no problem

930
01:38:49,423 --> 01:38:51,215
I'll see to it your message reaches her

931
01:38:52,343 --> 01:38:56,054
Seriously guys,
are we taking part in this contest?

932
01:38:57,306 --> 01:38:58,389
I don't know, man

933
01:38:58,641 --> 01:39:00,016
But I do

934
01:39:00,768 --> 01:39:03,478
Yes, Joe
This is my last chance

935
01:39:03,604 --> 01:39:05,355
And I don't want to throw it away

936
01:39:05,689 --> 01:39:09,108
Just think, it's not as if we have
to prove anything to the world

937
01:39:09,318 --> 01:39:11,402
If we do this, it's only for ourselves...

938
01:39:11,570 --> 01:39:15,114
to finish the journey we
began ten years ago

939
01:39:18,327 --> 01:39:19,494
For Magik?

940
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:21,120
For Magik

941
01:39:25,584 --> 01:39:29,045
Wow! When is the contest?
Can I come?

942
01:39:30,798 --> 01:39:34,634
I haven't told Mummy about it yet
-Why?

943
01:39:36,053 --> 01:39:37,804
I want to give her a surprise...

944
01:39:38,722 --> 01:39:39,806
So keep it...

945
01:39:41,725 --> 01:39:43,393
zipped

946
01:40:15,676 --> 01:40:17,427
Debbie...
-One second

947
01:40:17,886 --> 01:40:19,220
I've something to tell you...

948
01:40:20,055 --> 01:40:23,683
Okay, great. Joe's here too.
I'll talk to him and call you back

949
01:40:28,147 --> 01:40:30,523
That was Sandra.
Remember her?

950
01:40:31,066 --> 01:40:34,318
Her husband Pete is a chef
on the Blue Line Cruise

951
01:40:34,445 --> 01:40:37,071
His ship is on a six month voyage,
round-the-world

952
01:40:37,156 --> 01:40:40,867
They need musicians.
The money is very good

953
01:40:41,201 --> 01:40:43,369
Pete has already spoken for you.
Just contact them

954
01:40:47,791 --> 01:40:50,501
So you've planned to exile me?

955
01:40:51,170 --> 01:40:54,881
Stop joking!
Where will you find a better offer?

956
01:40:55,507 --> 01:40:58,301
Just imagine, you get to travel the world

957
01:40:58,552 --> 01:41:01,637
The company provides bed and board.
All you have to do is play the guitar

958
01:41:01,722 --> 01:41:03,097
And make money

959
01:41:05,476 --> 01:41:06,768
When is it sailing?

960
01:41:07,227 --> 01:41:09,395
On the 24th of next month, l think

961
01:41:12,066 --> 01:41:13,149
24th...?

962
01:41:13,275 --> 01:41:16,652
Yes, I think so. But before that
you have to do an audition

963
01:41:17,905 --> 01:41:19,030
Audition?

964
01:41:19,490 --> 01:41:23,242
Joe, come on. They don't know
how well you play the guitar

965
01:41:24,161 --> 01:41:27,163
I'm telling you,
when they hear you, they'll love it

966
01:41:27,247 --> 01:41:29,999
Yeah...
-You'll get the job really easily

967
01:41:54,191 --> 01:41:58,945
Rob has learnt it nicely
from Anu Malik

968
01:42:00,114 --> 01:42:02,198
We still have our magik touch

969
01:42:04,159 --> 01:42:05,952
Steaming hot

970
01:42:07,037 --> 01:42:09,997
-That song sounds definitely better.
-But it can become...

971
01:42:10,165 --> 01:42:13,000
"Much, much, much better"

972
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:20,758
Which reminds me...
are we going to Channel V tomorrow?

973
01:42:21,135 --> 01:42:23,386
What time?
-Four thirty

974
01:42:23,929 --> 01:42:27,140
But don't worry.
This time, we just fill up some forms

975
01:42:32,771 --> 01:42:35,064
A slight headache.
It's okay

976
01:42:37,442 --> 01:42:39,777
No thanks. I took pills in the morning

977
01:42:40,154 --> 01:42:43,781
Pills... what are your plans
after the rehearsal?

978
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:02,258
I heard you guys broke up?

979
01:43:03,385 --> 01:43:05,094
Guess, I was wrong

980
01:43:09,141 --> 01:43:12,101
Actually, we were on a break
But now, we're back

981
01:43:24,323 --> 01:43:27,825
Getting to see you up on stage
will be pretty cool

982
01:43:28,619 --> 01:43:30,411
And just look at your luck

983
01:43:30,621 --> 01:43:32,955
This time, there's no competition

984
01:43:33,874 --> 01:43:36,792
Especially since Chakravyuh
has stopped performing

985
01:43:39,129 --> 01:43:40,671
You're the lucky one

986
01:43:40,881 --> 01:43:44,217
You lost then and this time,
you wouldn't stand a chance

987
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:48,262
Well, you can't win everything in life

988
01:43:49,139 --> 01:43:53,476
Anyway, the channel is hosting a party
tomorrow night for the contestants

989
01:43:53,685 --> 01:43:55,645
If you guys are free,
why don't you come along?

990
01:43:57,856 --> 01:44:00,149
I'm getting tired
of being a culture bandit

991
01:44:00,317 --> 01:44:05,154
and oh... it's funny and sick
recalling all the ways

992
01:44:06,823 --> 01:44:08,366
Yesterday, we went for the sonography

993
01:44:08,909 --> 01:44:10,868
-It's beautiful.
-Yes, it's a great feeling

994
01:44:11,495 --> 01:44:14,830
KD, where's Rob?
-He should be here anytime

995
01:44:21,964 --> 01:44:25,174
Looking good, KD
-Thanks

996
01:44:36,311 --> 01:44:39,105
And you always look great, Devika

997
01:46:34,304 --> 01:46:38,808
"Tanya, after what happened
today, it's best that l leave."

998
01:46:39,726 --> 01:46:43,270
"When I'll meet you again, I can't say."

999
01:47:14,428 --> 01:47:15,678
What are you doing here?

1000
01:47:15,846 --> 01:47:18,848
The last time we met... was...
-Ages

1001
01:47:22,310 --> 01:47:25,271
How's Debbie?
-She's fine

1002
01:47:34,865 --> 01:47:37,032
Of course, you know each other

1003
01:47:49,629 --> 01:47:51,547
Remember, he and Joe scrapped...

1004
01:47:54,593 --> 01:47:56,343
We were so immature

1005
01:47:56,553 --> 01:47:59,096
Back then, even I thought
Ajay was a little weird

1006
01:47:59,639 --> 01:48:02,475
But after we became friends,
I got to know he's a nice guy

1007
01:48:36,676 --> 01:48:41,096
Tanya, I'm sorry,
for leaving the way I did

1008
01:48:42,140 --> 01:48:44,600
I found your note

1009
01:48:48,104 --> 01:48:50,981
I knew then,
you weren't coming back

1010
01:48:54,277 --> 01:48:56,946
Then, you knew more
about me than I did

1011
01:48:59,950 --> 01:49:01,200
Yes

1012
01:49:02,786 --> 01:49:05,204
Let bygones be bygones

1013
01:49:06,706 --> 01:49:07,790
Come on

1014
01:49:08,708 --> 01:49:12,545
But at least, you've got a second chance,
to perform with Magik

1015
01:49:13,630 --> 01:49:16,966
Life's rarely this generous with everyone

1016
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:25,766
You know,
I had put all that music behind me

1017
01:49:26,935 --> 01:49:29,645
But because of my wife Sakshi,
it's happening all over again

1018
01:49:39,489 --> 01:49:41,448
Tanya, a very old friend of mine

1019
01:49:42,284 --> 01:49:46,579
-I wanted to thank you
-Me?

1020
01:49:47,664 --> 01:49:53,544
If I hadn't seen your photographs,
I'd have never known Aditya had a band

1021
01:49:53,753 --> 01:49:57,381
First, I was afraid
I was petrified

1022
01:49:57,465 --> 01:50:01,510
I kept thinking, I could never live
without you by my side

1023
01:50:01,636 --> 01:50:04,263
Save the guests.
I am coming

1024
01:50:04,347 --> 01:50:05,764
..thinking how you did me wrong

1025
01:50:05,849 --> 01:50:09,768
I grew strong
I learnt how to get along

1026
01:50:09,853 --> 01:50:11,228
And now you're back

1027
01:50:11,813 --> 01:50:13,439
From outer space

1028
01:50:13,940 --> 01:50:18,277
I just walked in to find you here
with that sad look upon your face

1029
01:50:18,361 --> 01:50:22,364
I should've changed my stupid lock
I would've made you leave your key

1030
01:50:22,449 --> 01:50:26,410
If I’d known for just one second
you'd be back to bother me

1031
01:50:26,494 --> 01:50:27,953
Go on now, go...

1032
01:50:28,413 --> 01:50:29,955
walk out the door

1033
01:50:30,415 --> 01:50:35,252
Just turn around now
'cause you're not welcome anymore

1034
01:50:35,629 --> 01:50:38,756
Weren’t you the one who tried
to break me with your lies

1035
01:50:38,840 --> 01:50:42,843
You think I'd crumble,
you think I'd lay down and die

1036
01:50:42,927 --> 01:50:47,389
Oh no, not I, I will survive

1037
01:50:47,474 --> 01:50:51,352
As long as I know how to love,
I know I'll stay alive

1038
01:50:51,478 --> 01:50:55,147
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give

1039
01:50:55,231 --> 01:50:59,276
And I’ll survive, I will survive

1040
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:32,643
KD... I don't know these songs

1041
01:51:36,439 --> 01:51:40,567
KD... I only know Hindi songs

1042
01:52:05,135 --> 01:52:09,680
Strange story it has been

1043
01:52:11,182 --> 01:52:15,811
Where it began
Where will it all end

1044
01:52:17,397 --> 01:52:22,192
What destinies await us

1045
01:52:23,403 --> 01:52:28,657
Neither he knows, nor I

1046
01:52:30,368 --> 01:52:34,163
Strange story it has been,

1047
01:52:34,956 --> 01:52:39,168
Where it began
Where will it all end

1048
01:52:39,669 --> 01:52:43,422
What destinies await us

1049
01:52:44,174 --> 01:52:47,843
Neither he knows, nor I

1050
01:52:48,970 --> 01:52:52,639
Why does smoke...

1051
01:52:53,391 --> 01:52:57,019
obscure the lamplight?

1052
01:52:58,021 --> 01:53:01,940
Why does smoke...

1053
01:53:02,525 --> 01:53:06,361
obscure the lamplight?

1054
01:53:06,863 --> 01:53:10,616
In my dreams...

1055
01:53:11,534 --> 01:53:15,954
I have woken up from my dream

1056
01:53:16,206 --> 01:53:18,373
Talk to him...
-But Rob isn't taking my call

1057
01:53:18,625 --> 01:53:22,753
He must be busy.
-But he would answer...

1058
01:53:23,421 --> 01:53:25,047
Let's go to his place

1059
01:53:26,216 --> 01:53:27,716
Adi, talk to him.
-KD...

1060
01:53:27,884 --> 01:53:30,219
It's on our way back,
let's go there

1061
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:34,223
I'll drop you to the car

1062
01:54:19,018 --> 01:54:20,018
Hang in there

1063
01:54:20,103 --> 01:54:21,436
You'll be fine, hang in there

1064
01:54:21,521 --> 01:54:23,313
Adi, take the next right
Shit!

1065
01:54:24,107 --> 01:54:26,024
So what if it's a No Entry?
He's passing out

1066
01:54:26,109 --> 01:54:28,527
Rob, look at me, man... Rob

1067
01:54:29,696 --> 01:54:33,699
Just hang on... hang on...
we're reaching the hospital

1068
01:54:34,534 --> 01:54:36,618
You'll be fine,
you're going to make it

1069
01:54:40,039 --> 01:54:41,874
You see this?

1070
01:55:03,229 --> 01:55:07,232
Have you told Rob...
that he has brain tumour?

1071
01:55:07,317 --> 01:55:08,650
He knows

1072
01:55:11,070 --> 01:55:14,573
He tells me he's had some
chemotherapy sessions

1073
01:55:14,908 --> 01:55:17,743
And he's taking medication too

1074
01:55:22,415 --> 01:55:24,541
Why didn't he tell us?

1075
01:55:26,169 --> 01:55:28,253
What good would it do?

1076
01:55:29,339 --> 01:55:34,343
You'd re-unite Magik thinking,
poor Rob's dying

1077
01:55:35,011 --> 01:55:36,803
I didn't want that

1078
01:55:38,264 --> 01:55:44,102
If we are to get together again,
it has to be because...

1079
01:55:44,187 --> 01:55:49,191
we believe in Magik's music
and we believe in each other

1080
01:55:50,693 --> 01:55:53,570
But you don't believe we're your friends

1081
01:55:55,615 --> 01:55:56,907
Isn't that right?

1082
01:55:57,784 --> 01:55:59,618
It's not that, KD.

1083
01:56:00,536 --> 01:56:03,622
This tumour has become a part of my brain

1084
01:56:03,790 --> 01:56:07,000
I'm beyond curing. That's a fact

1085
01:56:08,628 --> 01:56:12,297
Two days, two months, two years...

1086
01:56:12,382 --> 01:56:15,384
How much longer will I live...?
I'm sick of thinking about that

1087
01:56:15,468 --> 01:56:18,595
Rob... listen to me

1088
01:56:19,138 --> 01:56:21,974
Dr Shetty is the country's
best neurosurgeon

1089
01:56:22,308 --> 01:56:23,892
I'll talk to him

1090
01:56:23,977 --> 01:56:26,478
We'll shift you to his personal clinic

1091
01:56:26,562 --> 01:56:29,606
You'll be all right.
-What the hell are you saying, Aditya?

1092
01:56:30,233 --> 01:56:33,652
Our show is on the 24th
... day after tomorrow

1093
01:56:35,071 --> 01:56:36,488
Have you gone mad?

1094
01:56:39,826 --> 01:56:43,495
This show is very important for me,
perhaps my last chance

1095
01:56:56,509 --> 01:56:59,261
You know how worried I've been?
What's wrong with you?

1096
01:57:00,013 --> 01:57:03,098
After you left, the cruise guys called.
Your visa is done

1097
01:57:03,266 --> 01:57:05,684
The ship is leaving tomorrow
and you're going to be on it

1098
01:57:09,522 --> 01:57:11,106
What's the matter, Joe?

1099
01:57:16,446 --> 01:57:18,947
And all these days,
you were lying to me?

1100
01:57:21,200 --> 01:57:23,035
This Magik and all this...

1101
01:57:24,203 --> 01:57:27,122
Can't you see there's no future in it?

1102
01:57:28,207 --> 01:57:31,710
Whenever it comes to this band,
why does your brain switch off, Joe?

1103
01:57:36,049 --> 01:57:37,049
I don't care

1104
01:57:37,216 --> 01:57:39,634
You're going on that
cruise and that's final

1105
01:57:42,638 --> 01:57:46,016
I've got another chance to do
what I've always wanted to...

1106
01:57:48,061 --> 01:57:50,145
I don't know how to do anything else

1107
01:57:52,065 --> 01:57:54,149
And now Rob...
-Stop it Joe

1108
01:57:54,817 --> 01:57:57,652
Agreed, what happened to Rob is terrible

1109
01:57:59,572 --> 01:58:01,740
But don't you see that your wife..

1110
01:58:01,824 --> 01:58:05,243
..has been dying a slow
death for ten years?

1111
01:58:07,246 --> 01:58:08,497
And Andy...

1112
01:58:08,915 --> 01:58:11,041
have you ever considered
his future?

1113
01:58:14,670 --> 01:58:17,506
In life, you've got to make compromises

1114
01:58:18,674 --> 01:58:20,509
I wanted to become a fashion designer

1115
01:58:22,261 --> 01:58:25,097
I'm working your goddamned
family fish-business

1116
01:58:26,057 --> 01:58:28,266
And what of Magik?

1117
01:58:28,434 --> 01:58:30,352
You want to be a rock star at your age?

1118
01:58:35,608 --> 01:58:38,068
Have you learnt nothing in ten years?

1119
01:58:38,444 --> 01:58:41,071
You're ready to trust the same man again

1120
01:59:03,469 --> 01:59:06,888
Ms Debbie is here to meet sir

1121
01:59:09,976 --> 01:59:12,394
Ask her to sit down. I'm coming

1122
01:59:20,319 --> 01:59:21,236
Welcome

1123
01:59:23,573 --> 01:59:26,324
You know, I've met your son Andrew

1124
01:59:30,496 --> 01:59:32,831
Oh... it's showing

1125
01:59:32,999 --> 01:59:35,167
Yes, there's a glow on your face

1126
01:59:36,169 --> 01:59:41,131
-Is Aditya in? -Please sit
in the study. I'll call him

1127
01:59:55,021 --> 01:59:57,105
I've been asking Joe
about you for ages

1128
01:59:57,190 --> 01:59:58,773
Sit

1129
01:59:58,941 --> 02:00:00,150
Will you have a drink?

1130
02:00:12,371 --> 02:00:15,957
But... you seem to be doing fine,
like always

1131
02:00:21,047 --> 02:00:24,966
Some people have all the luck,..

1132
02:00:25,218 --> 02:00:26,885
..they get whatever they want

1133
02:00:28,304 --> 02:00:29,888
Like you

1134
02:00:31,474 --> 02:00:35,310
You were a hero in college,
the creative rebel

1135
02:00:36,062 --> 02:00:40,190
And now, a successful businessman

1136
02:00:40,650 --> 02:00:42,192
Fantastic house

1137
02:00:43,319 --> 02:00:44,903
Pretty wife

1138
02:00:45,905 --> 02:00:48,198
And soon, a father

1139
02:00:49,492 --> 02:00:52,202
Everything a man can ask for...

1140
02:00:56,415 --> 02:01:00,919
I can't tell if you're
complimenting me or not

1141
02:01:02,171 --> 02:01:04,339
I'm just speaking the truth

1142
02:01:06,509 --> 02:01:08,677
Or you can take it this way...

1143
02:01:09,178 --> 02:01:12,514
I'm pointing out what
sets you apart from Joe

1144
02:01:15,101 --> 02:01:18,228
Joe... Joe isn't lucky like you, Aditya

1145
02:01:19,605 --> 02:01:22,023
He's fought against life at every step

1146
02:01:23,526 --> 02:01:25,777
And such was his luck...

1147
02:01:26,445 --> 02:01:28,238
most often, he failed

1148
02:01:33,369 --> 02:01:36,955
Please, stop showing him these new dreams

1149
02:01:38,124 --> 02:01:40,709
Because when these dreams shatter,

1150
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:46,047
the shards will wound
my life... Andrew's life

1151
02:01:49,302 --> 02:01:50,719
What are you trying to say?

1152
02:01:51,804 --> 02:01:55,265
If Joe goes for the show tomorrow,..

1153
02:01:55,308 --> 02:01:58,560
..he'll lose a very good job

1154
02:02:04,233 --> 02:02:08,153
Just let him go, Aditya. Please

1155
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:24,294
He still has fever, 1 02 degrees

1156
02:02:25,338 --> 02:02:27,005
I'm fine doctor

1157
02:02:27,673 --> 02:02:31,009
The fever will vanish
the moment I get out of here

1158
02:02:31,427 --> 02:02:33,094
Rob, please be serious

1159
02:02:33,346 --> 02:02:35,597
They don't become doctors overnight

1160
02:02:38,601 --> 02:02:41,019
What if something happens on the stage?

1161
02:02:42,188 --> 02:02:46,107
Guys, if you think so negatively,
I'll definitely collapse

1162
02:02:47,777 --> 02:02:48,860
Imagine...

1163
02:02:49,612 --> 02:02:55,116
tomorrow, we'll be on stage,
there'll be lights, a huge audience

1164
02:02:55,451 --> 02:02:56,868
There'll be music,

1165
02:02:56,952 --> 02:03:01,331
in its every beat and every note,
there will be life

1166
02:03:01,374 --> 02:03:03,041
Life

1167
02:03:04,043 --> 02:03:07,462
I want to live one night to the fullest
before l die

1168
02:03:07,630 --> 02:03:09,214
Don't give up on me!

1169
02:03:12,635 --> 02:03:14,969
You should save your energy for tomorrow

1170
02:03:17,890 --> 02:03:21,351
But if I have to go,
then why not with a bang

1171
02:03:25,481 --> 02:03:27,065
You're right

1172
02:03:29,151 --> 02:03:32,153
My eyes speak of bright stars,

1173
02:03:32,238 --> 02:03:34,072
colourful places

1174
02:03:34,156 --> 02:03:36,658
and open meadows

1175
02:03:36,826 --> 02:03:40,245
My thoughts speak of dancing shores,

1176
02:03:40,329 --> 02:03:44,666
where I stand alone, waiting for you

1177
02:03:44,834 --> 02:03:49,087
My dreams feel just like heaven

1178
02:03:52,716 --> 02:03:57,846
I'm just a traveler passing through

1179
02:03:59,849 --> 02:04:02,767
My eyes speak of bright stars,

1180
02:04:02,852 --> 02:04:04,769
colorful places

1181
02:04:04,854 --> 02:04:07,439
and open meadows

1182
02:04:07,523 --> 02:04:11,109
My thoughts speak of dancing shores,

1183
02:04:11,193 --> 02:04:15,405
where I stand alone, waiting for you

1184
02:04:15,448 --> 02:04:19,701
My dreams feel just like heaven,

1185
02:04:23,205 --> 02:04:27,625
I'm just a traveler passing through

1186
02:04:38,304 --> 02:04:42,474
Don’t let this moment pass us by...
as we talk

1187
02:04:51,150 --> 02:04:52,484
Tonight's the night!

1188
02:04:54,570 --> 02:04:58,323
-Where's Sakshi?
-She's watching the concert with Devika

1189
02:05:00,409 --> 02:05:01,493
Where's Joe?

1190
02:05:27,436 --> 02:05:29,938
I'm...

1191
02:05:30,022 --> 02:05:31,689
fully unzipped

1192
02:05:31,774 --> 02:05:32,941
Saying hear I am

1193
02:05:33,025 --> 02:05:34,108
take a look at it

1194
02:05:34,193 --> 02:05:37,695
I'm getting tired of being
a culture bandit

1195
02:05:37,780 --> 02:05:39,864
and oh...

1196
02:05:40,366 --> 02:05:41,950
it's funny and sick,

1197
02:05:42,034 --> 02:05:44,661
recalling all the ways...
I would paint my face

1198
02:05:44,745 --> 02:05:48,706
Saying, please come take me
oh I'm worthy please

1199
02:05:48,791 --> 02:05:51,376
I believe,

1200
02:05:51,460 --> 02:05:54,963
I'll receive love..

1201
02:05:55,047 --> 02:05:58,508
..but 'til then
I'm my own biggest fan

1202
02:06:03,973 --> 02:06:05,390
Where the hell is Joe, man?

1203
02:06:17,152 --> 02:06:18,653
I don't think Joe'll turn up

1204
02:06:22,491 --> 02:06:23,741
What do you mean?

1205
02:06:27,830 --> 02:06:30,248
Debbie came to see me last night

1206
02:06:31,250 --> 02:06:32,584
She said...

1207
02:06:32,918 --> 02:06:35,336
Joe's got a job on some ship..

1208
02:06:35,421 --> 02:06:36,671
..and he's leaving

1209
02:06:47,099 --> 02:06:50,435
I was still hopeful that he'd turn up

1210
02:06:53,439 --> 02:06:58,359
Even after a decade, Magik
is still stuck in the same rut

1211
02:07:10,873 --> 02:07:13,958
We always get caught
in this big ego clash...

1212
02:07:14,043 --> 02:07:15,793
between you and Joe

1213
02:07:15,961 --> 02:07:19,297
You the only ones with personal problems?
What about us?

1214
02:07:19,715 --> 02:07:20,715
Forget it

1215
02:07:20,799 --> 02:07:22,884
That's the problem, I can't let go!

1216
02:07:23,802 --> 02:07:26,304
Aditya and Joe may be able to

1217
02:07:26,722 --> 02:07:28,806
We can't go on stage without Joe

1218
02:07:28,891 --> 02:07:30,058
Why not?

1219
02:07:30,142 --> 02:07:33,227
If it's vital for Joe to be on that ship,
it's vital for me to be on stage

1220
02:07:33,395 --> 02:07:34,812
And no one can stop me!

1221
02:07:35,064 --> 02:07:38,650
Even if I have to play the drums for
twenty minutes on my own, I'll still go!

1222
02:07:38,817 --> 02:07:41,319
And you guys decide if you're with me

1223
02:07:59,505 --> 02:08:02,090
We have to reach the
airport in fifteen minutes

1224
02:08:06,762 --> 02:08:07,679
Magik?

1225
02:08:08,097 --> 02:08:10,264
Andy, turn around

1226
02:08:27,199 --> 02:08:29,867
It's been ten years since Magik performed

1227
02:08:31,537 --> 02:08:33,538
But the wait isn't over yet

1228
02:08:35,290 --> 02:08:38,668
This song is his and this is for him,..

1229
02:08:39,670 --> 02:08:41,379
..the one who couldn't be here today

1230
02:08:58,814 --> 02:09:01,232
With you beside me,

1231
02:09:02,985 --> 02:09:05,903
my heart sings a song

1232
02:09:07,740 --> 02:09:10,158
Without you,

1233
02:09:11,493 --> 02:09:15,913
my music is gone

1234
02:09:15,998 --> 02:09:19,834
If I have you with me,

1235
02:09:20,085 --> 02:09:23,713
I have everything

1236
02:09:24,923 --> 02:09:28,176
If you're gone,

1237
02:09:28,594 --> 02:09:32,722
there's not a thing

1238
02:09:34,266 --> 02:09:37,727
To have you with me,

1239
02:09:37,936 --> 02:09:46,611
is to live a wonderful dream

1240
02:09:46,862 --> 02:09:51,032
When you're around,
it feels like...

1241
02:09:51,116 --> 02:09:55,369
I've found every joy

1242
02:09:55,454 --> 02:09:59,749
When you're gone,

1243
02:09:59,792 --> 02:10:04,003
happiness doesn't satisfy me

1244
02:10:04,213 --> 02:10:09,217
It's my life that's asking,

1245
02:10:09,635 --> 02:10:14,639
for you

1246
02:10:42,042 --> 02:10:43,251
Papa, go!

1247
02:11:01,103 --> 02:11:05,189
When you're with me,

1248
02:11:05,274 --> 02:11:09,944
I can find my way

1249
02:11:10,028 --> 02:11:13,739
When you're gone,

1250
02:11:13,824 --> 02:11:17,702
there is no path

1251
02:11:18,287 --> 02:11:22,290
When you're here,

1252
02:11:22,374 --> 02:11:24,876
there is everything

1253
02:11:27,212 --> 02:11:29,630
Without you,

1254
02:11:30,883 --> 02:11:36,554
who's left?

1255
02:11:36,638 --> 02:11:40,141
If you're with me,

1256
02:11:40,225 --> 02:11:47,857
every moment is bliss

1257
02:11:49,067 --> 02:11:50,735
When you're with me,

1258
02:11:51,403 --> 02:11:57,491
I feel even the breeze
has the colour of love

1259
02:11:57,576 --> 02:11:59,869
When you're gone,

1260
02:11:59,912 --> 02:12:06,083
life is without spirit

1261
02:12:06,335 --> 02:12:15,885
When I found you,
I found life

1262
02:13:41,847 --> 02:13:46,767
Ladies and gentlemen...
please welcome, on lead guitar,

1263
02:13:46,935 --> 02:13:53,190
My friend, my brother,
Joseph Mascarenhas

1264
02:14:08,123 --> 02:14:11,625
Sinbad the sailor,
sailed away one day

1265
02:14:11,710 --> 02:14:14,712
listen up my friends

1266
02:14:15,213 --> 02:14:21,635
Looking for a new world
in his own way

1267
02:14:22,721 --> 02:14:28,642
He sailed into uncharted seas

1268
02:14:30,062 --> 02:14:36,025
He was at the mercy of the waves

1269
02:14:36,485 --> 02:14:40,154
He was warned not to go to sea

1270
02:14:40,238 --> 02:14:43,032
listen up my friends

1271
02:14:43,742 --> 02:14:47,161
Warned that it wasn't such
a good dream to see

1272
02:14:47,245 --> 02:14:50,039
listen up my friends

1273
02:14:51,083 --> 02:14:57,046
He was rapt in his own dreams

1274
02:14:57,756 --> 02:15:04,053
And he listened only to his heart

1275
02:15:05,097 --> 02:15:08,599
For the only thing he owned,
was a dream of his own,

1276
02:15:08,683 --> 02:15:12,186
that dream of Sinbad the sailor

1277
02:15:12,270 --> 02:15:15,689
For the only thing he owned,
was a dream of his own,

1278
02:15:15,774 --> 02:15:19,944
that dream of Sinbad the sailor

1279
02:15:33,542 --> 02:15:40,089
A typhoon struck his boat once
listen up my friends

1280
02:15:40,632 --> 02:15:47,096
But he kept his zeal afloat
listen up my friends

1281
02:15:47,472 --> 02:15:53,727
He was such a devotee

1282
02:15:54,646 --> 02:16:01,986
A dream-walker, that's what he was

1283
02:16:02,070 --> 02:16:05,573
For the only thing he owned,
was a dream of his own,

1284
02:16:05,657 --> 02:16:09,160
that dream of Sinbad the sailor

1285
02:16:09,244 --> 02:16:12,663
For the only thing he owned,
was a dream of his own,

1286
02:16:12,747 --> 02:16:16,584
that dream of Sinbad the sailor

1287
02:16:46,281 --> 02:16:51,202
Thirsting for a dream

1288
02:16:51,620 --> 02:16:58,375
He kept right on his path

1289
02:16:58,960 --> 02:17:02,463
The oceans were deep
and the waves tall,

1290
02:17:02,547 --> 02:17:05,382
listen up my friends

1291
02:17:06,134 --> 02:17:09,553
Where the largest ships sit uneasy,

1292
02:17:09,638 --> 02:17:12,223
listen up my friends

1293
02:17:14,643 --> 02:17:19,188
But he reached the shore one day

1294
02:17:20,065 --> 02:17:26,862
He finally reached his destiny

1295
02:17:27,405 --> 02:17:30,908
For the only thing he owned,
was a dream of his own,

1296
02:17:30,992 --> 02:17:34,495
that dream of Sinbad the sailor

1297
02:17:34,579 --> 02:17:38,082
For the only thing he owned,
was a dream of his own,

1298
02:17:38,166 --> 02:17:42,253
that dream of Sinbad the sailor

1299
02:17:58,353 --> 02:18:00,854
With you beside me,

1300
02:18:01,773 --> 02:18:04,275
my heart sings a song

1301
02:18:05,777 --> 02:18:08,696
Without you,

1302
02:18:08,863 --> 02:18:12,116
my music is gone

1303
02:18:12,534 --> 02:18:15,244
If I have you with me,

1304
02:18:15,954 --> 02:18:18,247
I have everything

1305
02:18:19,958 --> 02:18:22,251
If you're gone,

1306
02:18:23,044 --> 02:18:26,255
there's not a thing

1307
02:18:27,799 --> 02:18:30,634
To have you with me,

1308
02:18:30,802 --> 02:18:33,887
is to live

1309
02:18:33,972 --> 02:18:38,142
a wonderful dream

1310
02:18:38,226 --> 02:18:45,274
When you're around,
it feels like I’ve found every joy

1311
02:18:45,317 --> 02:18:52,489
When you're gone,
happiness doesn't satisfy me

1312
02:18:52,657 --> 02:18:55,159
It's my life that's asking...

1313
02:18:55,243 --> 02:19:01,290
for you

1314
02:20:24,999 --> 02:20:36,093
When someone has a dream in his eyes,

1315
02:20:36,261 --> 02:20:47,438
happiness is a joy
in chasing that dream

1316
02:20:47,856 --> 02:20:58,282
Just for once make a wish from life,

1317
02:20:58,867 --> 02:21:01,952
then you see

1318
02:21:04,622 --> 02:21:15,215
When someone has a song on his lips,

1319
02:21:15,884 --> 02:21:26,727
even a loss seems like a victory

1320
02:21:27,562 --> 02:21:32,149
The song in your heart...

1321
02:21:33,234 --> 02:21:37,488
sing it out, just for once...

1322
02:21:38,406 --> 02:21:41,325
then you see

1323
02:22:06,768 --> 02:22:09,686
When someone has memories...

1324
02:22:12,357 --> 02:22:17,486
of love,

1325
02:22:17,946 --> 02:22:21,114
every night is...

1326
02:22:23,701 --> 02:22:28,705
filled with dreams

1327
02:22:29,707 --> 02:22:34,211
Just for once, to someone,

1328
02:22:34,963 --> 02:22:40,217
give your heart...

1329
02:22:40,635 --> 02:22:43,387
then you see

1330
02:23:09,247 --> 02:23:19,673
So see a few dreams,
hear a few songs,
