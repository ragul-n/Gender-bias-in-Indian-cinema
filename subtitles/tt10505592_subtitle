1
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:08,743
Cigarette smoking is
injurious to health.

2
00:00:09,351 --> 00:00:10,716
It causes cancer.

3
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:16,014
Cigarette smoking is
injurious to health.

4
00:00:16,744 --> 00:00:18,595
Smoking causes cancer.

5
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,486
Hi!
- Hi!

6
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,378
I am Deep.
- Hello.

7
00:01:42,513 --> 00:01:44,986
I think I've seen you
somewhere before. - Really?

8
00:01:45,066 --> 00:01:47,000
Yes.
- Where?

9
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,797
In my heartbeat.

10
00:01:50,837 --> 00:01:51,878
Can we dance?

11
00:01:53,756 --> 00:01:54,797
Sure.

12
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:02,215
Can we spend some time together?

13
00:02:02,701 --> 00:02:04,918
Why not?
- Really?

14
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:08,796
Yes.
- There will be just you, me..

15
00:02:10,242 --> 00:02:11,918
..and a bed.

16
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,634
What? How dare you?

17
00:02:14,905 --> 00:02:17,080
My foot! Idiot!

18
00:02:17,783 --> 00:02:19,932
Excuse me. I didn't mean that.

19
00:02:23,513 --> 00:02:25,351
The word 'bed' just
slipped out of my mouth..

20
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:26,919
..and I messed up. Huh!

21
00:02:27,176 --> 00:02:28,466
Those are the words
from your heart that..

22
00:02:28,546 --> 00:02:29,787
..slipped out of your tongue.
- Keep quiet.

23
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:30,892
Get me a beer please.

24
00:02:34,852 --> 00:02:36,487
Look at Arya.

25
00:02:47,488 --> 00:02:49,839
Sorry, I don't dance.
Excuse me please.

26
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:53,676
Hi!

27
00:02:56,704 --> 00:02:57,880
Okay.

28
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,866
Cheers!
- Cheers!

29
00:03:02,718 --> 00:03:06,920
Arya, every girl
wants to dance with you.

30
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:08,813
Let's go and dance with them.

31
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:11,826
I just met a girl from St. Mary's.
I have fallen for her.

32
00:03:14,123 --> 00:03:16,042
Let's go please.
- Wait.

33
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:18,312
Ask him to dance.
- Why should I?

34
00:03:21,258 --> 00:03:23,420
Hey, dad has called up.
- Shh!

35
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:25,515
Yes, Dad.

36
00:03:29,218 --> 00:03:32,664
What? We've to go to Kolkata
tomorrow morning? Why suddenly?

37
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,245
No, I can't go all of a
sudden like this. Dad, please.

38
00:03:37,948 --> 00:03:39,786
Dad, please try to understand.
Listen to me...

39
00:03:41,664 --> 00:03:42,880
What happened?

40
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:45,191
I have to go to Kolkata
with dad tomorrow morning.

41
00:03:45,961 --> 00:03:46,992
Go then.

42
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,893
You should go.
- Yes, you should.

43
00:03:50,218 --> 00:03:51,698
You two also come along with me.

44
00:03:51,778 --> 00:03:53,542
No.
- No.

45
00:03:56,448 --> 00:03:57,678
I, alone,
will get bored over there.

46
00:03:57,758 --> 00:04:00,012
Please come with me.
Why don't you understand?

47
00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:01,893
You two are my best friends.

48
00:04:01,973 --> 00:04:03,677
Only if he says yes.

49
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,746
Okay.

50
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,503
Hey, are you guys hungry?

51
00:04:24,463 --> 00:04:26,943
Should we stop for a round of
tea and Samosa? - Not interested.

52
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,896
Kolkata means traffic and crowd.

53
00:04:30,558 --> 00:04:31,641
Does this even mean anything?

54
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:35,125
Kolkata's Durga Puja is absolute
positive case for you. - Superb!

55
00:04:36,138 --> 00:04:38,058
Why did we come to Kolkata
all of a sudden, Dad?

56
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:40,260
Just wait and watch.

57
00:04:42,003 --> 00:04:44,368
You kind of forced me to come here.
What is the case?

58
00:04:45,503 --> 00:04:46,692
Surprise.

59
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:48,337
First you decide
what you guys want to do.

60
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:50,175
You can't waste time like this.

61
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,650
Who will go to meet the sponsorers.
Do I have to go?

62
00:04:53,395 --> 00:04:55,830
Did you inform the decorator to
increase the height of the Pandal?

63
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,044
No, none of you did that.
Why do I... hey!

64
00:05:00,395 --> 00:05:01,881
Isn't that Banku?

65
00:05:02,341 --> 00:05:03,868
What's wrong with Banku?

66
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:06,139
Borda (eldest brother)!
Grandma!

67
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:08,328
Boro Boudi!
(eldest sister-in-law)

68
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:11,936
Grandma! - Slow down.
Why are you running? You will fall down.

69
00:05:12,016 --> 00:05:13,975
Forget running,

70
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:16,246
I almost flew down here.

71
00:05:16,436 --> 00:05:17,759
What's the matter, Banku?

72
00:05:18,174 --> 00:05:21,097
Grandma, Mita's husband..

73
00:05:21,665 --> 00:05:24,678
..has come to their Kolkata
house along with his son.

74
00:05:29,178 --> 00:05:32,043
I met the nephew of Nimai.

75
00:05:32,444 --> 00:05:34,083
He told me.

76
00:05:38,044 --> 00:05:39,260
What happened, Mom?

77
00:05:40,084 --> 00:05:41,814
Why are you crying?

78
00:05:41,894 --> 00:05:43,574
Why should we be
bothered about strangers?

79
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:49,969
What's the reason
for your excitement?

80
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:51,327
Get back to work.

81
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:59,421
None of you should
try to contact them.

82
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,600
They don't have any
existence in this house.

83
00:06:24,315 --> 00:06:29,004
This is the first house which
I and your mom had built together.

84
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,220
This house belongs to you.

85
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:35,490
I know, all this might
seem a bit strange to you.

86
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,423
You have never come
to Kolkata before.

87
00:06:39,936 --> 00:06:41,220
Let's go inside.

88
00:06:42,274 --> 00:06:43,626
Come along, you two.

89
00:06:43,706 --> 00:06:46,693
Hey, Piu, come out once.

90
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:51,261
Where will you find her, Aunt?
- What? - She isn't at home.

91
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,243
The Durga Puja festival
has started so she is..

92
00:06:53,323 --> 00:06:54,823
..out of the house
most of the time.

93
00:06:55,261 --> 00:06:56,667
She is super busy these days.

94
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,219
She is involved in the
play, song and dance..

95
00:06:58,299 --> 00:06:59,451
..organised by the
Durga Puja committee.

96
00:06:59,531 --> 00:07:01,817
She can be found on the Puja
ground during any time of the day.

97
00:07:01,897 --> 00:07:03,316
No obstacle can deter me.

98
00:07:03,802 --> 00:07:05,194
No power of this world..

99
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,964
..can separate me from you.

100
00:07:08,248 --> 00:07:10,529
I loved you the very moment
I saw you for the first time.

101
00:07:11,248 --> 00:07:13,694
I won't be able to love
anyone else in this lifetime.

102
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:14,978
No one.

103
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,140
Please send her to me
once she comes back home.

104
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:19,789
I need her help
regarding something.

105
00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:23,938
Wonderful! Amazing!

106
00:07:24,094 --> 00:07:26,478
All your dialogues seem to come
out straight from your heart.

107
00:07:27,883 --> 00:07:30,545
Isn't the script quite modern?
Tell me.

108
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:34,059
An all-girl historical play.

109
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:37,315
All of you, do you nest.
Let's rock Durgapur!

110
00:07:38,056 --> 00:07:39,734
What do you think? Very good.

111
00:07:40,288 --> 00:07:43,450
Malavika, why do you forget your
lines everyday at the same point?

112
00:07:43,883 --> 00:07:46,234
I have to have an one
on one session with you.

113
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,046
Hey!

114
00:08:04,762 --> 00:08:06,019
Hey, sleepyheads!

115
00:08:06,843 --> 00:08:10,614
My friends form Mumbai, wake up!
Wake up quickly.

116
00:08:11,343 --> 00:08:14,397
Hey, wake up, will you?

117
00:08:14,477 --> 00:08:16,681
Please, Dad. I am tired.

118
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,275
Wake up now.

119
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,897
Life is a magic.

120
00:08:21,977 --> 00:08:24,217
How will you see the magic
if you keep your eyes closed?

121
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:26,924
Hey, wake up!

122
00:08:27,438 --> 00:08:29,816
What's the matter?
- Get ready quickly.

123
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:32,059
Let's celebrate.

124
00:08:32,316 --> 00:08:33,490
Today is 'Tritiya'
(third day of waxing moon).

125
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,300
Your first night in Kolkata!

126
00:08:35,452 --> 00:08:38,709
Let's party, guys!
- Oh, yes!

127
00:08:39,236 --> 00:08:40,601
Party! Get in the groove, bro!

128
00:08:40,845 --> 00:08:42,939
Bachelors party, right?
- Yes. So?

129
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:45,493
I mean,
we three are definite bachelors.

130
00:08:45,871 --> 00:08:47,223
You are a kind of Bachelor too.

131
00:08:47,534 --> 00:08:48,790
What I am trying to say is..

132
00:08:49,277 --> 00:08:51,493
..don't you have any friends
or girlfriends...

133
00:08:51,677 --> 00:08:53,939
What will you do with my girlfriends?
- Oh...

134
00:08:54,223 --> 00:08:55,926
What were you saying?

135
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:57,799
I mean,
you girlfriends might have...

136
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,116
Daughters.
Is that you are trying to say?

137
00:08:59,196 --> 00:09:01,493
Yes...
- You brat, I need to teach you a lesson.

138
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:04,925
One tight slap is what you need.
Go and get ready fast. - Okay.

139
00:09:05,005 --> 00:09:06,371
Get going.

140
00:09:08,141 --> 00:09:09,681
Listen, don't be a lech all the time.

141
00:09:09,761 --> 00:09:12,776
Look at you!
Why are you still on bed?

142
00:09:13,241 --> 00:09:16,168
Arya! Arya, wake up, son. Wake up.

143
00:09:16,377 --> 00:09:17,560
Wake up, will you?

144
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:27,439
'Today I'll tell you
everything, Arya.'

145
00:09:28,439 --> 00:09:30,087
'Or else it'll be late.'

146
00:09:31,615 --> 00:09:33,791
Come along.
- Were you looking for me for this?

147
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,696
Come inside.

148
00:09:38,493 --> 00:09:41,493
Whom do you want to call.
- Wait a while.

149
00:09:44,907 --> 00:09:47,452
This is the number.

150
00:09:48,452 --> 00:09:49,993
Please connect the call for me.

151
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:52,074
Whose number is this?

152
00:09:53,466 --> 00:09:55,155
It's my grandson's number.

153
00:09:55,338 --> 00:09:57,560
I want to talk to him.
Connect me to him, please.

154
00:09:57,871 --> 00:09:59,222
Your grandson?

155
00:09:59,655 --> 00:10:03,033
You mean aunt Mitali's...
- Yes.

156
00:10:03,912 --> 00:10:06,128
But they live in Mumbai, don't they?

157
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:08,412
Yes, they do.

158
00:10:09,466 --> 00:10:11,885
But right now they are in Kolkata.

159
00:10:15,168 --> 00:10:16,492
Grandma, it's ringing.

160
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:19,492
Nimai, can you take the call.
- Sure, sir.

161
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,181
Hello. Yes, he is here. Hold on.

162
00:10:29,168 --> 00:10:30,168
Hello.

163
00:10:30,587 --> 00:10:31,587
Who is this?

164
00:10:32,776 --> 00:10:34,046
Biswadeep?

165
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,275
Yes, mother-in-law. It's me.

166
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:45,019
You remember my voice
even after so many years.

167
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:54,019
I want to talk to my grandson.

168
00:10:55,465 --> 00:10:57,951
Where is my Nanu darling?

169
00:10:58,154 --> 00:10:59,438
Hold on a moment please.

170
00:11:01,951 --> 00:11:03,708
Speak.

171
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,316
Hello.

172
00:11:12,397 --> 00:11:15,478
My dear, won't to come to meet?

173
00:11:17,614 --> 00:11:20,118
She is your Grandmother.
Speak to her.

174
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,262
Hi Granny. How are you?

175
00:11:25,154 --> 00:11:29,316
I am good, dear.

176
00:11:30,478 --> 00:11:33,222
Come to me, won't you?

177
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:38,572
I have so many stories to
tell you about your mom.

178
00:11:39,261 --> 00:11:41,504
I never got the chance
to tell you anything.

179
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:43,504
Won't you fulfill my wish?

180
00:11:45,207 --> 00:11:47,640
Hello! Hello!

181
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,964
My dear... Hello.

182
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,613
Let me see.
- Uh...

183
00:11:51,964 --> 00:11:53,208
He isn't talking.

184
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,370
Hello.

185
00:11:55,951 --> 00:11:57,519
Hello. Can you hear me?

186
00:11:58,234 --> 00:12:00,058
Your grandma is requesting
you to come here.

187
00:12:00,248 --> 00:12:02,288
Here in Durgapur.

188
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:03,707
Hello.

189
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,180
Give me the phone.

190
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:11,180
Hello.

191
00:12:11,572 --> 00:12:17,923
Biswadeep, am I not going to
meet my grandson before I die?

192
00:12:19,747 --> 00:12:21,423
Arya will go to Durgapur, Mother-in-law.

193
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,449
I would have sent him even
if you wouldn't have called.

194
00:12:26,922 --> 00:12:27,922
He will go.

195
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:31,693
Impossible! Durgapur?

196
00:12:32,395 --> 00:12:34,235
There is no way that
I can go to Durgapur now.

197
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,890
I am already so bored over here.
Dad, please don't do this.

198
00:12:38,953 --> 00:12:40,775
Is this why you lied to me
and brought me here?

199
00:12:41,963 --> 00:12:43,395
You have to go to them.

200
00:12:44,868 --> 00:12:46,548
That's the reason
behind our Kolkata trip.

201
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:51,438
I would have sent you to Durgapur even
if your grandma wouldn't have called.

202
00:12:53,044 --> 00:12:56,977
They are you kins.
They are very close to you.

203
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,368
For the last 20 years
I couldn't say you something.

204
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:07,990
I had thought that I will tell
you once you grow up..

205
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,422
..so that you can
understand everything.

206
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,882
Your mom's family didn't accept
my marriage with your mom.

207
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:22,098
Back then I used to do a job with
a salary of 2,200 rupees a month.

208
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:27,516
No one would want to have such a
poor husband for their daughter.

209
00:13:31,408 --> 00:13:34,800
Since the day of the wedding,
your eldest uncle(maternal)..

210
00:13:35,894 --> 00:13:38,394
..disowned Mita.

211
00:13:40,882 --> 00:13:43,044
Why did you have to call them up?

212
00:13:44,084 --> 00:13:46,489
Did they ever care to check on us?

213
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:48,571
Why did you call them?

214
00:13:49,382 --> 00:13:52,747
Mitali is my daughter.

215
00:13:55,038 --> 00:13:57,139
She is your only sister.

216
00:13:58,085 --> 00:14:00,720
Don't you have any feeling for her?

217
00:14:03,206 --> 00:14:09,558
I haven't seen...
how big Mita's son has become.

218
00:14:09,788 --> 00:14:11,437
They haven't seen Arya before,
have they?

219
00:14:12,302 --> 00:14:19,977
No. I wanted to take Arya to them but
his uncle had prohibited me.

220
00:14:21,801 --> 00:14:23,531
So why are you asking me to go now?

221
00:14:24,612 --> 00:14:26,153
I have a fear, Arya.

222
00:14:27,653 --> 00:14:29,666
Who will look after you
after my passing?

223
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:33,479
There is no one else
whom we can call our own.

224
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:36,585
Please go.

225
00:14:37,463 --> 00:14:38,950
Go and visit your mom's family.

226
00:14:40,652 --> 00:14:42,220
They might not like me..

227
00:14:43,463 --> 00:14:45,409
..but you will be welcomed
with open hearts.

228
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,842
You are forgetting one thing, Mom.

229
00:14:48,598 --> 00:14:52,963
Biswadeep didn't even inform us
about Mita's demise.

230
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:55,652
How could you even think...

231
00:14:57,571 --> 00:15:00,058
My grandson will
definitely come here.

232
00:15:00,761 --> 00:15:03,517
My grandson will come
here tomorrow itself.

233
00:15:04,544 --> 00:15:07,842
If you get a chance to talk
to your uncle then tell him..

234
00:15:09,374 --> 00:15:11,608
..that I has sent a message to
them about your mom's demise.

235
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,774
Those days there
was no mobile phone.

236
00:15:16,098 --> 00:15:17,787
I had requested so many people.

237
00:15:18,882 --> 00:15:20,760
I had asked one person
to deliver the message.

238
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:23,192
But he had delivered
the message much later.

239
00:15:25,017 --> 00:15:28,719
I was taking care of you all by myself.

240
00:15:29,665 --> 00:15:32,345
Taking care of you was more crucial
than sending message to people.

241
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:35,530
I had no one by my side then.
I was so perplexed.

242
00:15:36,354 --> 00:15:44,503
I just held your tiny fingers and
sat quietly being numb.

243
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,313
Hey, Ryan.
- Yes?

244
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,560
Make me one more drink please.
- Okay, Uncle.

245
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:03,934
So ultimately what
is being decided?

246
00:16:04,745 --> 00:16:07,664
Are we going to Durgapur's
Markoni tomorrow? - Yes, my son.

247
00:16:08,745 --> 00:16:11,786
Weren't you saying that
there is no thrill over here?

248
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,893
Go and have an adventure at
Arya's maternal uncle's place.

249
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:22,987
You will find your mom,
once you go there.

250
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,311
We were not even supposed
to come to Kolkata.

251
00:16:38,391 --> 00:16:40,907
So? - But we will be spending the
Durga Puja festival at Durgapur.

252
00:16:40,987 --> 00:16:41,987
Why?

253
00:16:42,797 --> 00:16:43,960
Why?

254
00:16:44,608 --> 00:16:45,608
Why?

255
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:48,008
You will understand tomorrow
morning, once we reach there.

256
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,324
"I became familiar with the roads..

257
00:17:15,404 --> 00:17:17,742
..as soon as I embarked
on the highway."

258
00:17:17,822 --> 00:17:20,134
"The shops and markets
are running beside us..

259
00:17:20,214 --> 00:17:22,553
..but we are not moving."

260
00:17:22,783 --> 00:17:24,999
"Let three plus three
make six or nine..

261
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,229
..today, in this wrong route."

262
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:29,702
"The small town is left with us..

263
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,999
..and we will see that
through a long shot."

264
00:17:32,756 --> 00:17:36,418
"The thought and worries
are on a holiday now."

265
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:41,553
"We don't need any routine now."

266
00:17:42,188 --> 00:17:47,039
"Our desires are all of
five star quality now."

267
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:51,323
"We have reached the
festival of light."

268
00:17:53,891 --> 00:17:57,809
"My heart is eager to move ahead."

269
00:17:58,229 --> 00:18:02,621
"This is the time for fun,
frolic and psychedelic adventures."

270
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:07,216
"The four wheels of the car
are running on full speed.."

271
00:18:08,094 --> 00:18:10,310
..and we are almost
flying endlessly."

272
00:18:55,524 --> 00:18:59,717
"My heart,
standing at the verge of desires..

273
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,510
..wants to embark on
a journey of love."

274
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:09,931
"My heart decks up
itself and looks for..

275
00:19:10,011 --> 00:19:14,292
..own self in the mirror
of one's songs."

276
00:19:14,878 --> 00:19:19,109
"My heart,
standing at the verge of desires..

277
00:19:19,574 --> 00:19:22,902
..wants to embark on
a journey of love."

278
00:19:24,973 --> 00:19:27,324
"Let it tiptoe or
run if it feels like..

279
00:19:27,404 --> 00:19:29,621
..being playful."

280
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,162
"The wind is blowing
in a random manner..

281
00:19:32,242 --> 00:19:34,081
..the heart also wants
to take off and fly."

282
00:19:34,622 --> 00:19:36,919
"Let it tiptoe or
run if it feels like..

283
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:39,324
..being playful."

284
00:19:39,404 --> 00:19:41,730
"The wind is blowing
in a random manner..

285
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,824
..the heart also wants
to take off and fly."

286
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:53,513
"The thought and worries
are on a holiday now."

287
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:58,364
"We don't need any routine now."

288
00:19:58,905 --> 00:20:02,932
"Our desires are all of
five star quality now."

289
00:20:03,594 --> 00:20:07,634
"We have reached the
festival of light."

290
00:20:10,648 --> 00:20:13,986
"My heart is eager to move ahead."

291
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:17,040
"This is the time for fun, frolic..

292
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,472
..and psychedelic adventures."

293
00:20:19,756 --> 00:20:22,378
"The four wheels of the car
are running on full speed..

294
00:20:24,986 --> 00:20:27,432
..and we are almost
flying endlessly."

295
00:20:30,526 --> 00:20:32,810
Piu! You go ahead.
I will come and join you.

296
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:38,066
Here you are!
All decked up and looking pretty.

297
00:20:38,431 --> 00:20:40,311
Do you remember about the rehearsal
that is scheduled this morning?

298
00:20:40,391 --> 00:20:41,878
Are you planning to ruin the play?

299
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:44,541
I am going to the rehearsal right away.
Please don't be tensed.

300
00:20:44,621 --> 00:20:48,500
There is so much going inside my head.
How can I not be tensed?

301
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,260
Will you be happy
if our play gets spoilt?

302
00:20:50,811 --> 00:20:53,135
Come to the rehearsal right away.
I am going ahead. Okay?

303
00:20:57,324 --> 00:21:00,391
Hey, listen. How am I looking?

304
00:21:01,324 --> 00:21:02,729
Very pretty!

305
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,878
But you should keep
an eye on your husband.

306
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,094
Why?

307
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:13,432
I saw uncle Swapan sharing
light moments with Jhumpa.

308
00:21:14,472 --> 00:21:15,851
I see!

309
00:21:16,553 --> 00:21:19,431
That's why he took so much time
in the morning to dress up.

310
00:21:19,877 --> 00:21:21,540
He was so eager to come to the
Puja ground as soon as possible.

311
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,944
Now I will teach him a lesson.

312
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:27,944
You are absolutely right, Piu.

313
00:21:28,823 --> 00:21:30,147
Did you see that?

314
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,107
Go to the rehearsal.

315
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:35,741
I will join you in a while.

316
00:21:36,674 --> 00:21:38,728
I have to end this today.

317
00:21:39,444 --> 00:21:42,295
I will lock him inside the
bathroom through out the night.

318
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,120
Were you flirting with her?

319
00:21:53,661 --> 00:21:55,039
You old haggard!

320
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,620
Don't you feel ashamed?

321
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:46,458
'You will find your mom,
once you go there.'

322
00:23:06,363 --> 00:23:10,418
Shampa! Sister-in-law!
Come out and see, who has come!

323
00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:22,080
Who is Arya among you...

324
00:23:22,498 --> 00:23:23,836
I am Arya.

325
00:23:42,227 --> 00:23:44,687
I am your youngest maternal uncle.

326
00:23:47,294 --> 00:23:48,470
She is your eldest aunt.

327
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:50,240
And she is your youngest aunt.

328
00:23:51,727 --> 00:23:58,632
Sister-in-law, just look at him.
Doesn't he look like Mita?

329
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,023
You resemble Mitali so much!

330
00:24:13,739 --> 00:24:14,969
Let it be.

331
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,860
God bless you, my dear.

332
00:24:19,508 --> 00:24:20,548
You don't need to do that.

333
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,602
Bring them inside.

334
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,021
Mother-in-law is waiting for you
since long. She is so restless.

335
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:32,143
Come inside, all of you.

336
00:24:32,223 --> 00:24:35,319
Mom! Come and see, who has come
to meet you. - Come inside.

337
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:37,711
Why are you guys standing outside?
Come inside, please.

338
00:25:27,953 --> 00:25:30,791
Come inside, my brothers.
This is your room.

339
00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:35,588
Nice. Very nice.

340
00:25:39,048 --> 00:25:40,521
My brother!

341
00:25:40,601 --> 00:25:41,913
He lives in Mumbai.

342
00:25:41,993 --> 00:25:44,274
His Hindi needs serious treatment.
- Please leave me, bro.

343
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,913
Hey, have you seen
Shahrukh Khan's bungalow?

344
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:52,170
And Sunny Leonne? I have heard
that she jogs on Juhu beach. - Never.

345
00:25:54,306 --> 00:25:55,751
Are Mallika's those ones fake?

346
00:25:56,481 --> 00:25:57,481
Which ones?

347
00:26:03,482 --> 00:26:04,914
I have already told my friends..

348
00:26:04,994 --> 00:26:06,536
..that my cousin is
coming from Mumbai.

349
00:26:06,616 --> 00:26:08,806
They will become so
jealous to see you all.

350
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:11,886
Wow! What a nice Tattoo!

351
00:26:12,265 --> 00:26:14,913
Uff! And you have
three earrings too!

352
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:16,116
Lovely!

353
00:26:16,452 --> 00:26:18,444
Even your shirt is also so nice.
You all should come..

354
00:26:18,524 --> 00:26:20,424
..to the Puja venue wearing
this kind of clothes.

355
00:26:20,658 --> 00:26:23,419
Okay. - You guys have bath and
get ready. I'll be back in sometime.

356
00:26:23,631 --> 00:26:25,030
After that we will have
lunch together and then..

357
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,524
..go to the Puja Pandal together.
Okay, bro?

358
00:26:26,604 --> 00:26:29,306
Bye. Okay?
- Bye. - Okay.

359
00:26:30,441 --> 00:26:31,819
He is a strange character!

360
00:26:33,116 --> 00:26:35,157
Who is he?
- Arya, is that your cousin?

361
00:26:35,414 --> 00:26:36,752
'My brother!'

362
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:49,319
I had packed the right thing
at the right moment.

363
00:26:52,941 --> 00:26:56,171
Excuse me. - What? - Why don't you
all have bath one after another?

364
00:26:56,623 --> 00:26:58,833
I have kept everything
inside the bathroom. - Okay.

365
00:26:59,631 --> 00:27:01,293
Okay.
- Okay? - Yes.

366
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:29,684
"When you pinched me..."

367
00:27:32,197 --> 00:27:34,008
God, you are great!

368
00:27:35,723 --> 00:27:38,968
Wherever I go, God sends a
voluptuous lady in front of me.

369
00:27:39,198 --> 00:27:40,968
This is Arya's
maternal uncle's place.

370
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:43,090
If you get caught,
your reputation will be at stake.

371
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,995
Maternal uncle's places are fun.

372
00:27:45,265 --> 00:27:48,088
You don't get beaten up over there.
- Where are you going?

373
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:49,289
To the Puja Pandal.

374
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:04,942
I'll give you one tight slap.
Why are you running so much?

375
00:28:05,022 --> 00:28:06,589
I will go for the Olympic!

376
00:28:06,792 --> 00:28:08,522
Hey, Piu!
Where were you all this while?

377
00:28:08,738 --> 00:28:10,468
I have kept Payesh(sweet dish)
for you.

378
00:28:10,548 --> 00:28:11,319
Won't you eat?

379
00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:13,035
That's why I came here running.

380
00:28:13,115 --> 00:28:15,211
I am very hungry.
Let me go and wash my hands first.

381
00:28:24,115 --> 00:28:25,115
Oh my!

382
00:28:29,804 --> 00:28:31,953
What nonsense! Couldn't she knock?

383
00:28:32,831 --> 00:28:34,951
How stupid of me!
It's me who hasn't locked the door.

384
00:28:39,954 --> 00:28:44,277
Piu! Hey, Piu! Why are you going?
Won't you eat the Payesh?

385
00:28:47,986 --> 00:28:49,952
Is that guy...

386
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,129
There is so much food on the table.
Aunt, how will we eat so much?

387
00:28:54,209 --> 00:28:57,614
Oh, Arya! We can definitely finish
the food if we all try together.

388
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,102
Isn't that Aloo-posto
(Bengali delicacy)?

389
00:28:59,277 --> 00:29:00,506
He is right.

390
00:29:00,586 --> 00:29:02,277
Do you want me to
believe that three of you..

391
00:29:02,357 --> 00:29:04,236
..can't finish this food?
- A little more please.

392
00:29:04,316 --> 00:29:07,938
Besides, there is no one to feed
you with so much care in Mumbai.

393
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,618
You will definitely
finish all the food.

394
00:29:27,484 --> 00:29:29,681
Hey! Why are you standing here?

395
00:29:29,924 --> 00:29:31,127
Come inside.

396
00:29:31,207 --> 00:29:32,586
Look at her.

397
00:29:33,817 --> 00:29:36,763
She wasn't coming inside since Arya
and his friends are having lunch.

398
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:38,925
Silly girl!

399
00:29:39,662 --> 00:29:41,655
Hey, Piu, what the matter with you?

400
00:29:42,073 --> 00:29:44,170
Your aunt had asked you to eat
Payesh and you said that you'll eat..

401
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,289
..after you wash your hands.
Where did you disappear after that?

402
00:29:46,469 --> 00:29:51,167
Arya, she is Piu. Crazy Piu!

403
00:29:51,438 --> 00:29:54,438
She is your youngest aunt's niece.
They live close by.

404
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,938
And he is Arya.

405
00:29:57,127 --> 00:29:58,398
He is my sister's son.

406
00:29:58,478 --> 00:29:59,654
Hi!

407
00:30:11,531 --> 00:30:13,437
What happened?
- I think the food is too hot for him.

408
00:30:13,517 --> 00:30:15,666
Have you eaten a chilli?
- Give him some sugar or water.

409
00:30:15,746 --> 00:30:18,883
Slow down or else you
will choke yourself.

410
00:30:18,963 --> 00:30:20,451
Drink some water.

411
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:35,384
This is my cousin, Arya.

412
00:30:35,464 --> 00:30:36,924
He lives in Mumbai.

413
00:30:37,109 --> 00:30:38,519
This is his friend, Deep.

414
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,480
Have you seen his Tattoo?
Why don't you show them, Deep?

415
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,452
And he is Ryan.

416
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:46,897
Priyanka Chopra come to his
terrace everyday to have juice.

417
00:30:47,141 --> 00:30:48,650
And Shahrukh Khan?
- He is your cousin!

418
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,642
Shahrukh cycles everyday
behind his apartment.

419
00:30:50,722 --> 00:30:53,282
Why don't you tell them.
- Yes. He is right. - Didn't I tell you?

420
00:30:53,467 --> 00:30:56,427
Katrina Kaif resides in the
apartment beside his. - What?

421
00:30:56,507 --> 00:30:58,454
Once Deep had seen Katrina
wearing just a towel..

422
00:30:58,534 --> 00:31:01,008
..and had fainted. Isn't it, Deep?
- Uff! - Yes.

423
00:31:01,088 --> 00:31:02,799
He will surely faint now.

424
00:31:04,434 --> 00:31:07,366
Your brother is my brother.
Let's take him to Mumbai.

425
00:31:07,758 --> 00:31:09,069
At the rate he is
cooking up stories..

426
00:31:09,149 --> 00:31:11,204
..the film magazines will
appoint him immediately.

427
00:31:11,284 --> 00:31:13,907
Hey, Bunty!
- Yes? - Listen.

428
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,420
What is it?

429
00:31:17,285 --> 00:31:18,691
Excuse me for a minute, bro.

430
00:31:18,771 --> 00:31:20,988
Arya, I will be back in a while.
- Okay.

431
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:35,799
My binocular lady!
- Don't do this, Deep. - Wait and watch.

432
00:31:38,908 --> 00:31:40,435
Don't do this, Deep.

433
00:31:45,002 --> 00:31:48,489
Sorry! Hi!
- Oh my!

434
00:31:49,989 --> 00:31:51,097
Who are you?

435
00:31:51,314 --> 00:31:52,706
Are you new in this neighbourhood?

436
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:58,179
New. Young. Let the fire blaze!

437
00:32:00,842 --> 00:32:03,206
Fire can burn your hands.
- Let them burn.

438
00:32:03,761 --> 00:32:06,801
Let them turn to ashes.
What's your name, my lady?

439
00:32:08,221 --> 00:32:09,559
Her name is Jharna.

440
00:32:11,194 --> 00:32:13,396
Oh God! Who is he?

441
00:32:13,738 --> 00:32:15,830
He must be your uncle. I think
he wants to say something to you.

442
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,748
He is my husband. Bubla.

443
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,316
Where is your water bottle?

444
00:32:20,681 --> 00:32:22,532
You haven't had water since long.
- Water?

445
00:32:22,802 --> 00:32:24,856
Where were you all this while?
You are perspiring.

446
00:32:25,802 --> 00:32:28,181
Am I? Hey, am I perspiring?
- No.

447
00:32:28,424 --> 00:32:30,559
Rather I am perspiring.
- Let's go, Jharna.

448
00:32:31,397 --> 00:32:35,654
I have told you so many times
not to talk to strangers.

449
00:32:37,047 --> 00:32:38,128
Come along.

450
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:42,560
Bye.
- Okay.

451
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,317
I will see you during the Puja.
- Sure.

452
00:32:50,547 --> 00:32:51,911
What is your name?
- Deep.

453
00:32:52,614 --> 00:32:54,141
I have come down from Mumbai.

454
00:33:00,128 --> 00:33:01,763
Hey, was he completely naked?

455
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:04,696
Wasn't he even wearing a towel?
- Stop it.

456
00:33:05,655 --> 00:33:08,182
I didn't know that there was
someone inside the bathroom.

457
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,926
That guy hadn't close the door.

458
00:33:13,656 --> 00:33:15,993
That's his maternal uncle's place.
His name is Arya.

459
00:33:16,669 --> 00:33:19,311
Hey, you must be remembering
the incident every..

460
00:33:19,391 --> 00:33:22,031
..time you are meeting the guy, isn't it?
- Uff!

461
00:33:22,547 --> 00:33:24,403
You're feeling shy since you haven't..

462
00:33:24,483 --> 00:33:26,341
..seen any such thing earlier.
- Yes.

463
00:33:26,628 --> 00:33:29,398
You must be quite habituated to
see such scenes. - Keep quiet.

464
00:33:31,952 --> 00:33:33,331
There comes your brother.

465
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:34,655
Why is he coming this way?

466
00:33:34,735 --> 00:33:36,735
Just look how he is coming
towards us like a bull.

467
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:43,219
Bro, come with me.
You've got something important to do.

468
00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:44,143
Where do you want me to go?

469
00:33:44,223 --> 00:33:46,250
I have some personal problem.

470
00:33:46,655 --> 00:33:48,358
I can't solve it without your help.

471
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,460
Today I need to see
to the end of it.

472
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,724
Come along.
- Where do we have to go?

473
00:33:51,804 --> 00:33:53,291
Come along, will you?
I need your help.

474
00:33:53,371 --> 00:33:55,043
I need your help desperately.
- Arya..

475
00:33:55,123 --> 00:33:57,126
I'm not getting into this.
We'll be in trouble.

476
00:33:57,358 --> 00:33:59,116
I see! Do you think he'll be in trouble
if he goes with me?

477
00:33:59,196 --> 00:34:01,399
How could you say that?
- My brother..

478
00:34:01,764 --> 00:34:03,372
..my reading never goes wrong.

479
00:34:03,588 --> 00:34:05,155
We'll be in trouble
if we go with him.

480
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,493
Look, are you planning to get us
into any trouble?

481
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:11,207
Do you think you'll get into trouble
if you go with me?

482
00:34:15,628 --> 00:34:17,547
Hey, let's go.

483
00:34:23,886 --> 00:34:28,183
Arya, where has your
brother brought us to?

484
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,265
Hey, do you have any
plan of a robbery?

485
00:34:32,683 --> 00:34:35,048
She will be here any moment now.
- Who will come?

486
00:34:35,128 --> 00:34:36,534
What are we doing here?

487
00:34:38,305 --> 00:34:39,305
There they come.

488
00:34:44,387 --> 00:34:46,968
Did you bring us here to show them?

489
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:48,874
This is what we want.

490
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:51,455
Don't say 'we'.
This is what only you want. - Quiet!

491
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:54,604
Bro, look at the girl in the middle.

492
00:34:58,523 --> 00:35:00,632
What are you doing?
- Come with me once, bro. - Why?

493
00:35:00,889 --> 00:35:03,632
Please come. - What are you up to?
- Please come with me.

494
00:35:03,712 --> 00:35:05,266
I need your help.
- What are you up to?

495
00:35:05,346 --> 00:35:07,035
Didn't I tell you
that Arya's cousin...

496
00:35:10,565 --> 00:35:14,227
Hi. This is my cousin, Arya.
He lives in Mumbai.

497
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:16,430
Now you can speak in
English as much as you want.

498
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,444
Hey, Bunty, what are you doing?

499
00:35:18,524 --> 00:35:19,844
I tell her 'I love you' everyday.

500
00:35:20,024 --> 00:35:21,484
He replies me in
English every time.

501
00:35:21,781 --> 00:35:23,092
I don't understand anything.

502
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:26,064
My English is weak since I was a child,
you know?

503
00:35:26,483 --> 00:35:28,253
Now you say what you have to say.

504
00:35:29,024 --> 00:35:31,618
He is my cousin.
He lives in Lokhandwala.

505
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:34,266
Bro, why don't you tell her
in English? - Keep quiet!

506
00:35:35,618 --> 00:35:38,018
None of you can understand what
the other person has to say.

507
00:35:38,204 --> 00:35:39,172
And you want to have
an affair with her?

508
00:35:39,394 --> 00:35:41,006
Don't try to reach out to the Moon.

509
00:35:41,943 --> 00:35:45,888
Hi. I'm Deep...
from Mumbai.

510
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:49,591
Many people must have told you
that you've got beautiful eyes.

511
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,874
But has anyone told you
before that your eyes can..

512
00:35:52,954 --> 00:35:54,966
..become the 'best eyes' in
Miss world competition?

513
00:35:55,132 --> 00:35:56,713
But I can't understand anything.

514
00:35:56,793 --> 00:35:58,809
You don't need to understand anything.
Let's go home.

515
00:35:58,889 --> 00:36:01,348
You are so smitten by love, aren't you?

516
00:36:01,591 --> 00:36:03,064
Let me show you.

517
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:07,199
Why did she blow a whistle?

518
00:36:11,686 --> 00:36:13,024
Who are these guys?

519
00:36:20,024 --> 00:36:21,254
Bro, who are these guys?

520
00:36:21,781 --> 00:36:22,997
Who is the culprit?
- It's him.

521
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:26,752
Your brother...
- I will beat you up all today.

522
00:36:26,832 --> 00:36:27,780
Hey, wait.

523
00:36:28,471 --> 00:36:30,981
What you mean by 'all'?
This is Bunty's personal problem.

524
00:36:31,061 --> 00:36:32,074
So beat him up.

525
00:36:32,415 --> 00:36:35,050
Arya! - Yes?
- Let's go from here.

526
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,929
Bye.
- Greetings.

527
00:36:37,442 --> 00:36:39,037
Greetings. Bye.
- Let's go, bro.

528
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:43,042
Hey, where are you going?
- Don't leave me alone, bro.

529
00:36:43,122 --> 00:36:44,925
How dare you tease my girlfriend?

530
00:36:45,005 --> 00:36:47,387
Are they beating him up?

531
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:53,954
Hey, wait.

532
00:36:56,603 --> 00:36:57,846
Let's go from here.

533
00:36:58,171 --> 00:36:59,649
They are beating him up.

534
00:36:59,729 --> 00:37:01,279
There is no point lending a
helping hand now.

535
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,089
We'll also get beaten up. Let's go.
- What are you saying?

536
00:37:04,169 --> 00:37:05,468
He is my cousin.

537
00:37:06,319 --> 00:37:08,656
How dare you come to our
locality and tease our girls?

538
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:12,440
Hey!

539
00:37:36,061 --> 00:37:37,824
Hey, Santosh! Bachchu!

540
00:37:37,904 --> 00:37:39,801
Guys from a different locality
has entered our locality. Come along.

541
00:37:48,656 --> 00:37:51,426
Guys from a different
locality are beating us up!

542
00:37:51,751 --> 00:37:54,021
They are the guys from
a different locality.

543
00:37:54,277 --> 00:37:59,953
Did you say that we are guys
from a different locality?

544
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,817
Run!

545
00:38:24,087 --> 00:38:25,871
He is a very handsome guy.

546
00:38:26,398 --> 00:38:27,533
He looks like a film star.

547
00:38:27,952 --> 00:38:29,722
He seems a bit childish.

548
00:38:29,802 --> 00:38:33,060
Apparently he is very shy, quite,
reserve and introvert.

549
00:38:33,398 --> 00:38:35,911
But he has a child within him.

550
00:38:35,991 --> 00:38:38,231
He was behaving like a kid
when he had eaten the chilli.

551
00:38:38,532 --> 00:38:39,964
So you should bring up the kid.

552
00:38:42,127 --> 00:38:44,006
Weren't you saying that
the air and the sky..

553
00:38:44,086 --> 00:38:45,975
..of this place seem a
bit different to you?

554
00:38:46,153 --> 00:38:47,200
You were also saying
that the festival..

555
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,329
..this time seems a
bit different to you.

556
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:51,139
I think, during this festive
season you'll surely fall in love.

557
00:38:52,017 --> 00:38:55,585
Keep quiet. Don't talk nonsense.

558
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,706
Hi! Can you help me?

559
00:39:02,017 --> 00:39:03,409
Is my uncle's house this way?

560
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,152
No, it's that way.

561
00:39:07,436 --> 00:39:08,855
Oh, I see. Thanks.

562
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,261
Why don't you come with
me and show me the way?

563
00:39:20,369 --> 00:39:21,531
Come along.

564
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,423
Why is that guy?
- It's him.

565
00:39:26,747 --> 00:39:29,153
Oh my! Really?

566
00:39:56,665 --> 00:39:57,733
Thank you so much.

567
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,070
Apply the medicine now.

568
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:12,179
It's bleeding profusely.

569
00:40:12,705 --> 00:40:15,584
MY poor child! Hurry up.
Dress his wound.

570
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:16,597
What is the necessity?

571
00:40:16,677 --> 00:40:20,043
You don't have to think about that.
Let us handle this.

572
00:40:21,111 --> 00:40:22,624
Apply the medicine properly.

573
00:40:25,179 --> 00:40:28,827
Sorry.
- Don't be afraid. It will be fine.

574
00:40:32,354 --> 00:40:34,097
Where is Bunty?

575
00:40:34,314 --> 00:40:35,989
Can't he stay with his brother?

576
00:40:38,705 --> 00:40:41,097
There he is! You, idiot!

577
00:40:41,177 --> 00:40:42,638
Don't you feel ashamed?

578
00:40:42,881 --> 00:40:45,300
Wait, I'll teach you a lesson.

579
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,597
Let your dad come back home.

580
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:51,205
I will ask him to smear
chilli paste in your eyes.

581
00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:54,016
Let me see. Oh my God!
- It's alright. Thank you.

582
00:40:54,206 --> 00:40:55,895
Grandma, you all can go now.
I am alright.

583
00:40:56,111 --> 00:40:58,611
Thank you. I am fine.
- Don't remove the cotton.

584
00:40:59,421 --> 00:41:01,056
Come, dear. Come along with me.

585
00:41:01,327 --> 00:41:02,935
You have gone too far.

586
00:41:03,015 --> 00:41:05,350
I'll teach you a lesson.
- I'm done. Thanks.

587
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,192
I'll teach you a lesson.

588
00:41:25,881 --> 00:41:27,314
Grandma always talks
to me like that.

589
00:41:27,394 --> 00:41:29,773
But whatever you guys have
done is just mind blowing.

590
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:32,205
That why it is said..

591
00:41:32,285 --> 00:41:34,732
..that many brothers
means more power.

592
00:41:36,488 --> 00:41:39,232
Hey, what do we do with him now?
- What do you mean?

593
00:41:39,813 --> 00:41:42,556
Let beat the hell out of him.

594
00:41:43,055 --> 00:41:44,501
I haven't done anything.
- Hey, quiet!

595
00:41:44,581 --> 00:41:46,258
Why did you take us with you?
- Because of you...

596
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:49,110
Stop hitting me.

597
00:41:50,055 --> 00:41:52,285
Look, bro,
how your friends are hitting me.

598
00:41:52,365 --> 00:41:54,001
Why shouldn't we hit you?
- Wait.

599
00:41:54,474 --> 00:41:55,799
Don't hit him. Let him go.

600
00:41:56,272 --> 00:41:57,796
Today,
when you had ran away leaving me

601
00:41:57,876 --> 00:41:59,336
behind,
I was very annoyed with you.

602
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:02,677
If you were in my situation today,
I would never have fled away.

603
00:42:02,906 --> 00:42:05,541
Do you know that?
- You are a crazy guy. Do you know that?

604
00:42:06,866 --> 00:42:08,306
This is not the way
to love someone.

605
00:42:09,447 --> 00:42:13,258
When a girl and a guy like each other,
something happens within.

606
00:42:13,338 --> 00:42:14,690
A sense of emotion arises.

607
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,744
And then being tall or short..

608
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,170
..or being poor or rich
or English medium..

609
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,904
..or Bengali medium
doesn't matter at all.

610
00:42:21,407 --> 00:42:22,596
Look at me.

611
00:42:22,785 --> 00:42:24,348
I've never felt any
such emotion towards..

612
00:42:24,428 --> 00:42:25,894
..any girl so far,
so I never had an affair.

613
00:42:25,974 --> 00:42:28,014
And I have no issues about it.
Just forget it, bro.

614
00:42:29,717 --> 00:42:31,477
I will experience it
when I'll fall in love.

615
00:42:42,366 --> 00:42:44,114
"Oh my heart,
like a letter without an address.."

616
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:45,904
..be quiet and listen to me."

617
00:42:46,123 --> 00:42:49,137
"I want to whisper
something into your ears."

618
00:42:49,556 --> 00:42:51,340
"I forget my daily chores..

619
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,974
..when I hear of him."

620
00:42:56,974 --> 00:43:00,542
"Oh my heart, like a bee..

621
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:04,366
..why have you forgotten
your hearth and home?"

622
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:10,515
"I want him so much that
I miss him every moment."

623
00:43:11,069 --> 00:43:14,826
"I go closer to him
in signs and symbols."

624
00:43:14,906 --> 00:43:18,731
"If my heart wants to lose
itself then let it be."

625
00:43:18,811 --> 00:43:22,312
"If my heart wants to lose
itself then let it be."

626
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:26,123
"My heart is helpless today."

627
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:29,650
"My heart is helpless today."

628
00:43:29,921 --> 00:43:33,489
"If my heart wants to lose
itself then let it be."

629
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:37,326
"If my heart wants to lose
itself then let it be."

630
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:40,610
"My heart is helpless today."

631
00:43:52,571 --> 00:43:56,220
"The misty air whispers..

632
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:02,747
..who is going to bring
the sweet Autumn?"

633
00:44:03,396 --> 00:44:07,125
"The misty air whispers..

634
00:44:07,383 --> 00:44:10,287
..who is going to bring..

635
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:13,814
..the sweet Autumn?"

636
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:18,274
"The ocean of my dreams helped
me understand the depth."

637
00:44:18,476 --> 00:44:21,619
"My heart is restless
so are my eyes to..

638
00:44:21,699 --> 00:44:25,136
..have a glimpse of him
through the window."

639
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:29,368
"My friends gossip that
I am smitten by him."

640
00:44:29,448 --> 00:44:33,057
"I have opened my heart with the
magical hope of leading him in..

641
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:39,354
..as if a firefly in a distance
wants to say something."

642
00:44:39,867 --> 00:44:43,678
"If my heart wants to lose
itself then let it be."

643
00:44:43,758 --> 00:44:47,395
"If my heart wants to lose
itself then let it be."

644
00:44:47,475 --> 00:44:51,435
"My heart is helpless today."

645
00:44:51,759 --> 00:44:54,178
My life is meaningless without
you, Prithviraj.

646
00:44:55,057 --> 00:44:57,580
If I have to live
this life without you..

647
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,797
..then I would rather
prefer death.

648
00:45:02,111 --> 00:45:04,016
I will give up my life.

649
00:45:20,179 --> 00:45:21,179
What happened, Piu?

650
00:45:23,355 --> 00:45:24,789
Why did you stop
saying your dialogues?

651
00:45:24,869 --> 00:45:26,247
You were doing so well.

652
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:29,119
I have immense hope on you about
making the play a success.

653
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,409
Hey, Malavika, come here.

654
00:45:32,085 --> 00:45:35,329
someone is singing."

655
00:45:36,231 --> 00:45:39,910
"He is familiar to me, yet,
in an unfamiliar language..

656
00:45:40,139 --> 00:45:45,977
..someone is singing."

657
00:45:46,057 --> 00:45:46,651
Hey!

658
00:45:48,277 --> 00:45:48,951
Hey!

659
00:45:49,031 --> 00:45:51,221
Why don't you ask Tanuka
to go from here?

660
00:45:51,301 --> 00:45:54,071
I think he will stay on the terrace
for quite some time now.

661
00:45:55,125 --> 00:45:56,733
Ha she also fallen for you?

662
00:45:56,988 --> 00:45:57,949
Keep quiet.

663
00:46:00,963 --> 00:46:04,017
Look here. Here Prithviraj
has become too emotional.

664
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:07,720
Wait. Let me ask
Tanuka to go from here.

665
00:46:08,193 --> 00:46:10,058
Sanyukta is about
to give up her life.

666
00:46:10,477 --> 00:46:12,181
Don't you understand that?
- I'm afraid, Tanuka..

667
00:46:12,261 --> 00:46:15,666
..you might also have to give up your
life at this age because of love.

668
00:46:15,963 --> 00:46:17,112
What do you mean?

669
00:46:17,585 --> 00:46:20,126
Uncle Swapan had gone for a
facial in this festive season.

670
00:46:20,315 --> 00:46:21,436
What?

671
00:46:22,355 --> 00:46:26,690
You didn't even realise that he is
glowing. Whom is he trying to impress?

672
00:46:27,477 --> 00:46:29,991
Do you think it's for Jhumpa?

673
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:32,139
Is Swapan having an
affair with Jhumpa?

674
00:46:32,396 --> 00:46:35,180
God knows. How will I understand?

675
00:46:35,494 --> 00:46:37,338
He is your husband.
You will understand better.

676
00:46:37,418 --> 00:46:38,931
But this is quite obvious..

677
00:46:39,483 --> 00:46:41,569
..that both of them seem
to be smitten by love.

678
00:46:42,368 --> 00:46:43,980
I won't spare them.

679
00:46:44,118 --> 00:46:45,937
I will see to the end of it.

680
00:46:47,255 --> 00:46:48,520
Today's rehearsal is over.

681
00:46:53,645 --> 00:46:55,608
Aren't we going to rehearse
any more today? - No.

682
00:46:59,591 --> 00:47:00,975
We won't rehearse any more today.

683
00:47:05,926 --> 00:47:08,185
Go and talk to him.
- Go.

684
00:47:08,876 --> 00:47:10,458
You guys should go now.

685
00:47:10,538 --> 00:47:13,030
Let us know about all that
you two will say to each other.

686
00:47:14,629 --> 00:47:16,055
Let's go.
- Yes.

687
00:47:38,844 --> 00:47:40,364
Shall I spread the
clothes for drying?

688
00:47:40,617 --> 00:47:42,055
No. Thanks.

689
00:47:42,271 --> 00:47:44,473
You have to squeeze out the
water from the clothes properly.

690
00:47:44,553 --> 00:47:45,936
I can do it.

691
00:47:46,271 --> 00:47:49,093
It's quite obvious that you don't
have the habit of drying clothes.

692
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,483
I will make a habit of it.

693
00:47:52,464 --> 00:47:53,613
My aunts had offered
to wash my clothes..

694
00:47:53,693 --> 00:47:55,504
..but I insisted on
doing it myself.

695
00:47:55,666 --> 00:47:58,888
Anyway,
when is the show of your play?

696
00:47:59,563 --> 00:48:00,747
It's two days after the Puja.

697
00:48:02,585 --> 00:48:03,861
Are you the female lead?
- Yes.

698
00:48:04,175 --> 00:48:05,548
I am playing Sanyukta.

699
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,451
Good. All the best.

700
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:21,549
You just leave them. I will spread
out the rest of the clothes.

701
00:48:28,154 --> 00:48:29,657
I already told you
that I can do it.

702
00:48:43,277 --> 00:48:45,255
You were so reluctant
to go to Durgapur.

703
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:47,634
Now you seem to have
forgotten your dad.

704
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:50,283
I am sure you are enjoying a lot.
Good.

705
00:48:50,363 --> 00:48:52,443
You have no idea
how we are being treated over here.

706
00:48:52,747 --> 00:48:54,427
We are being forcefully
fed day and night.

707
00:48:54,672 --> 00:48:57,014
So many different kinds of
traditional sweets are being made.

708
00:48:57,094 --> 00:49:00,057
Didn't I tell you that maternal
uncle's place will be fun?

709
00:49:01,148 --> 00:49:03,884
So, did you get to meet any girl...
- Dad, please!

710
00:49:05,592 --> 00:49:08,674
The only obstacle is eldest uncle.
He appears to be so grumpy.

711
00:49:09,236 --> 00:49:12,425
What do you mean?
- I mean, he isn't talking to me properly.

712
00:49:12,505 --> 00:49:14,003
He seems angry all the time.

713
00:49:14,749 --> 00:49:16,629
Do you remember Manoj Khambe,
my maths teacher?

714
00:49:16,922 --> 00:49:18,046
Uncle is somewhat like him.

715
00:49:18,629 --> 00:49:20,803
Actually he is annoyed with me.

716
00:49:21,873 --> 00:49:23,387
And you are my son.

717
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,127
But everything will be alright.

718
00:49:26,144 --> 00:49:27,344
Listen, take care of yourself.

719
00:49:27,614 --> 00:49:29,787
And call me up at times.
- Sure.

720
00:49:30,284 --> 00:49:31,560
Bye.

721
00:49:36,045 --> 00:49:38,122
The time is approaching.

722
00:49:38,922 --> 00:49:41,873
I have to tell Arya that
my days are numbered.

723
00:49:43,323 --> 00:49:45,301
But how do I tell him?

724
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:47,625
It will be too difficult
to control him.

725
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:53,302
Which one will look good on him.

726
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:54,950
Let's see.

727
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:14,112
See this. Isn't it nice?

728
00:50:15,149 --> 00:50:16,879
Very nice.

729
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,215
Let's buy this. What do you think?

730
00:50:20,544 --> 00:50:22,123
Please pack this for me.

731
00:50:30,383 --> 00:50:32,859
Listen to me. Don't do this.

732
00:50:33,162 --> 00:50:35,811
You are looking so handsome.
Just like a prince.

733
00:50:35,891 --> 00:50:37,613
Yes, Grandma,
it's a bit long but that's okay.

734
00:50:37,693 --> 00:50:39,165
It's not too long though.

735
00:50:39,325 --> 00:50:41,365
Do you think this is a bit long?
I won't wear this.

736
00:50:41,552 --> 00:50:42,666
What are you saying?

737
00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:44,664
You shouldn't talk like that.

738
00:50:44,744 --> 00:50:47,359
That's not fair, Grandma.
I won't wear this Kurta.

739
00:50:47,552 --> 00:50:49,087
What? Who has bought...

740
00:50:54,807 --> 00:50:57,282
Piu, where did you bring this from?

741
00:50:57,801 --> 00:50:59,736
He is not wanting to wear it.

742
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:03,811
Let me have a look.
- This is too long.

743
00:51:05,141 --> 00:51:07,746
Okay. Give it to me.
I will stitch it a bit and shorten it.

744
00:51:11,843 --> 00:51:13,995
Uff! Now we are
really getting late.

745
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,059
We won't get a place to
stand inside the Pandal.

746
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:18,477
You seem so eager to offer flowers
to the Goddess. Keep quiet.

747
00:51:18,557 --> 00:51:20,167
You are just not understanding.

748
00:51:20,247 --> 00:51:22,167
Offering flowers is everything.

749
00:51:22,632 --> 00:51:25,432
I will stand beside Jharna and
offer flowers to the Goddess.

750
00:51:25,984 --> 00:51:29,011
"Now that you have pinched me..."

751
00:51:31,738 --> 00:51:36,140
I think, Jharna will be an
amazing experience.

752
00:51:36,806 --> 00:51:38,467
Experience of lifetime!

753
00:51:39,392 --> 00:51:41,641
May be tonight itself...
- Deep, please keep quiet.

754
00:51:45,558 --> 00:51:46,558
Hey!

755
00:51:47,055 --> 00:51:49,156
Has Piu come back?
- Where is she?

756
00:51:49,657 --> 00:51:52,295
Grandma, let me wear something else.
Your tailor will be late.

757
00:51:52,493 --> 00:51:54,733
No, please don't say that, dear.

758
00:51:55,088 --> 00:51:57,258
Piu is very good at stitching.

759
00:51:58,374 --> 00:52:01,064
Do you know what a
good girl Piu is?

760
00:52:01,323 --> 00:52:05,915
She is not only good in studies
but also can sing and dance.

761
00:52:06,184 --> 00:52:08,700
She has got an award for stitching.

762
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:10,909
Grandma,
she is the perfect Bengali bride.

763
00:52:11,096 --> 00:52:12,212
Get her hitched
with your grandson.

764
00:52:12,292 --> 00:52:14,036
One tight slap...

765
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:54,420
Deep, where are you taking us?
- Come along, will you?

766
00:52:54,662 --> 00:52:57,646
If Arya's eldest uncle comes to know,
he'll beat us black and blue.

767
00:52:57,848 --> 00:52:59,457
Where are you taking us?

768
00:52:59,777 --> 00:53:01,184
We could have gone
behind the Kul ground.

769
00:53:01,264 --> 00:53:04,265
No one stays that side.
You don't even know the place.

770
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:07,379
Bunty, I'll give you one
tight slap if you talk much.

771
00:53:07,459 --> 00:53:10,008
Hold the bottles properly.
Don't drop a single bottle.

772
00:53:10,544 --> 00:53:12,544
Come along. - He is right.
Where are you taking us?

773
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:17,523
Deep, listen to me.
Don't make this a suspense thriller.

774
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,338
Bunty had taken us
with him without..

775
00:53:19,418 --> 00:53:21,153
..disclosing anything to us
and we were in trouble.

776
00:53:21,233 --> 00:53:24,978
Come along. Trust me, guys.
Just come along with me.

777
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:34,776
This is Jharna and Bubla's house.

778
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,420
Hey, Deep,
why did you bring us here?

779
00:53:38,504 --> 00:53:40,095
Jharna has worshipped
Goddess Annapurna.

780
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,546
She has invited us for
the 'Prasad'(offering).

781
00:53:41,626 --> 00:53:42,742
Stupid!

782
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,200
Deep, can you share
your plan with us?

783
00:53:46,358 --> 00:53:48,295
Wait.
- Arya! - Wait.

784
00:53:48,771 --> 00:53:49,731
Deep!

785
00:53:49,811 --> 00:53:52,836
We offer our reverence
to the elders.

786
00:53:53,087 --> 00:53:56,953
We offer our best wishes
to our friends and juniors.

787
00:53:57,195 --> 00:54:00,880
Today we are going to present
on this cultural stage...

788
00:54:01,182 --> 00:54:04,002
Hello, Jharna,
we are waiting behind your house.

789
00:54:04,183 --> 00:54:05,238
Yes, we have reached.

790
00:54:08,188 --> 00:54:09,868
Do you want me to climb
up to the terrace?

791
00:54:13,818 --> 00:54:14,818
Okay, I am coming.

792
00:54:17,173 --> 00:54:18,626
Deep, what are you doing?

793
00:54:18,997 --> 00:54:20,917
I have to climb up the
wall to each the terrace.

794
00:54:25,958 --> 00:54:30,829
"We are the messengers
of the new youth."

795
00:54:30,909 --> 00:54:32,505
Do you want us to drink
at Jharna's house?

796
00:54:32,585 --> 00:54:34,468
If anyone comes to know,
we'll be beaten up black and blue.

797
00:54:34,548 --> 00:54:35,845
Nothing such is going to happen.

798
00:54:35,925 --> 00:54:37,445
You guys will climb
up to the terrace.

799
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:40,774
And drink there.
I will be downstairs, along with Jharna.

800
00:54:41,423 --> 00:54:45,937
"We are the messengers
of the new youth."

801
00:54:47,139 --> 00:54:48,859
Can't you do this much
for friendship, bro?

802
00:54:50,418 --> 00:54:52,009
You two are my childhood friends.

803
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:55,495
You are getting us into trouble.
- Hey, wait.

804
00:54:55,884 --> 00:54:57,718
I can't understand anything.

805
00:54:58,098 --> 00:54:59,569
We might drink on the terrace.

806
00:55:00,018 --> 00:55:02,181
But what will Deep and
Jharna do downstairs?

807
00:55:02,518 --> 00:55:04,092
I should rather go and call Bubla.

808
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:06,099
We all can chat together.

809
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,578
Who has given you the permission
to live in West Bengal?

810
00:55:08,658 --> 00:55:09,922
Just keep quiet!

811
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:13,327
Hey, how are we going to
climb up to the terrace?

812
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:15,059
I am also thinking
about the same thing.

813
00:55:16,304 --> 00:55:21,182
"We are the messengers
of the new youth."

814
00:55:23,656 --> 00:55:26,404
"We make mistakes.
We dive into deep waters.."

815
00:55:26,484 --> 00:55:29,199
"..and exert to find
our way to the bank."

816
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:32,105
"We make mistakes."

817
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:39,060
"We dive into deep waters and exert
to find our way to shore.."

818
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:41,239
"We make mistakes."

819
00:55:41,319 --> 00:55:45,684
"Where ever we are summoned,
even amidst a life defying storm.."

820
00:55:45,764 --> 00:55:50,080
"Where ever we are summoned,
even amidst a life defying storm.."

821
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,736
"...we are ready."

822
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:28,908
What is he doing?
- I don't know.

823
00:56:32,843 --> 00:56:35,351
Don't be shy, okay.
Consider this to be your own house.

824
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:37,780
Okay? - I might not consider
this house to be my own.

825
00:56:37,945 --> 00:56:39,458
But I consider you my own.

826
00:56:40,262 --> 00:56:41,342
Will you come down, please?

827
00:56:41,853 --> 00:56:43,064
Sure. I am coming.

828
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:49,738
There he is.

829
00:56:50,658 --> 00:56:52,906
Destiny is calling me downstairs.
- Go to hell!

830
00:56:53,926 --> 00:56:56,410
Look, Deep,
I am not finding this right.

831
00:56:56,842 --> 00:56:58,442
I am requesting you.
Let's go from here.

832
00:56:58,831 --> 00:57:00,206
Jharna will be disheartened.

833
00:57:00,726 --> 00:57:02,726
She is a soft hearted woman.
She doesn't say much.

834
00:57:03,104 --> 00:57:06,616
And her husband is someone like
Bubla who is like a test cricketer.

835
00:57:06,696 --> 00:57:09,547
Jharna needs some
blast in her life.

836
00:57:10,032 --> 00:57:11,396
Her player needs to
come to the field..

837
00:57:11,476 --> 00:57:12,964
..during slog over and
hit fours and sixes.

838
00:57:13,044 --> 00:57:14,659
You guys continue drinking.
Enjoy yourself.

839
00:57:14,739 --> 00:57:17,299
If anything happens by chance,
you can climb down the rear wall.

840
00:57:17,496 --> 00:57:18,698
Bye.

841
00:57:24,769 --> 00:57:28,168
Deep will be in trouble
if Bubla comes back home.

842
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:29,664
Why?

843
00:57:29,744 --> 00:57:31,385
Bubla bites when he gets angry.

844
00:57:31,636 --> 00:57:34,568
He throws whole bricks. - What?
- He has a very good aim.

845
00:57:35,086 --> 00:57:36,660
Deep will be in trouble.

846
00:57:39,739 --> 00:57:41,331
Cheers, bro!
- Cheers!

847
00:57:51,831 --> 00:57:52,991
Hey, what is this doing here?

848
00:57:55,275 --> 00:57:58,180
"Now that you have pinched me.."

849
00:57:59,262 --> 00:58:00,672
"..all over my body."

850
00:58:01,986 --> 00:58:02,986
'Silly boy!'

851
00:58:12,053 --> 00:58:14,786
"Now that you have pinched me..."

852
00:58:17,381 --> 00:58:20,218
Please sit down patiently.

853
00:58:20,641 --> 00:58:24,057
Within a little while,
we will start a new program.

854
00:58:24,137 --> 00:58:25,674
Come to me, please.
- What?

855
00:58:26,426 --> 00:58:28,066
Come to me, please.
- Catch me if you can.

856
00:58:28,424 --> 00:58:30,811
Let me see how you can do that.
- Just wait and watch.

857
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:37,013
Come to me, will you?

858
00:58:42,246 --> 00:58:43,246
Hey!

859
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:51,639
What happened, bro? Are you tensed?

860
00:58:52,841 --> 00:58:55,116
No, no. Don't worry.

861
00:58:55,392 --> 00:58:56,595
I am enjoying,
- Huh!

862
00:58:58,039 --> 00:58:59,215
I am really enjoying a lot.

863
00:59:00,428 --> 00:59:01,581
At my maternal uncle's place..

864
00:59:04,815 --> 00:59:06,074
..everyone is so good.

865
00:59:07,727 --> 00:59:09,024
Life is so smooth.

866
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:11,287
Don't be tensed.

867
00:59:12,342 --> 00:59:13,865
He speaks in English
when he is drunk.

868
00:59:15,987 --> 00:59:17,307
Everyone is so good, aren't they?

869
00:59:20,052 --> 00:59:21,418
If mom was alive today..

870
00:59:23,502 --> 00:59:25,382
..everybody would accept
dad as one of their own.

871
00:59:28,415 --> 00:59:29,855
It would be more fun then, isn't it?

872
00:59:31,623 --> 00:59:34,962
Look at Bunty. I didn't even know
him earlier. Now he is my brother.

873
00:59:35,809 --> 00:59:37,132
My brother!

874
00:59:37,502 --> 00:59:39,173
Cheers!
- Cheers!

875
00:59:45,918 --> 00:59:47,319
Hey, I am getting pissed off now.

876
00:59:48,106 --> 00:59:49,118
Come closer, will you?

877
00:59:50,822 --> 00:59:52,382
What will you give
me if I come closer?

878
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:55,379
I have come here
to give you my all.

879
00:59:58,163 --> 01:00:00,914
What a lech you are!
I have noticed since the very first day.

880
01:00:01,173 --> 01:00:03,672
You are being so impatient.
- I am coming to get you!

881
01:00:04,053 --> 01:00:05,065
Hey!

882
01:00:06,751 --> 01:00:07,751
I will get you!

883
01:00:08,005 --> 01:00:09,005
Hey!

884
01:00:09,812 --> 01:00:10,980
Who will save you now?

885
01:00:22,474 --> 01:00:23,873
What is the idiot doing downstairs?

886
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:25,769
Cheers!
- To hell with your cheers!

887
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:30,540
Jharna!

888
01:00:34,461 --> 01:00:35,516
Jharna!

889
01:00:38,292 --> 01:00:39,434
Jharna!

890
01:00:42,176 --> 01:00:43,646
Jharna, where are you?

891
01:00:43,844 --> 01:00:44,844
Jharna!

892
01:00:47,616 --> 01:00:49,147
What happened? Open the door.

893
01:00:49,311 --> 01:00:52,399
What will happen now? - That means,
his music program has got over.

894
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:54,566
We are doomed now!

895
01:00:56,351 --> 01:00:58,262
Strange!
- We are doomed! It's Bubla.

896
01:00:59,291 --> 01:01:01,929
Jharna!
- Stop laughing!

897
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:03,283
Jharna!

898
01:01:04,454 --> 01:01:05,774
Move away from the edge.
- Jharna!

899
01:01:07,662 --> 01:01:10,689
Is she unwell?
- I had warned you before. - Quiet!

900
01:01:11,606 --> 01:01:14,356
Bubla will throw bricks
at us and break our heads.

901
01:01:14,953 --> 01:01:16,726
What happened, Jharna?

902
01:01:19,927 --> 01:01:21,717
Who has entered our house, Jharna?

903
01:01:21,951 --> 01:01:22,951
Hey!

904
01:01:24,278 --> 01:01:25,506
What's that noise?

905
01:01:28,083 --> 01:01:30,081
I am going to kill Deep. I promise!

906
01:01:30,825 --> 01:01:32,347
Deep!
- Deep!

907
01:01:32,615 --> 01:01:34,820
I am feeling too tensed, Jharna.

908
01:01:37,034 --> 01:01:38,409
What's that noise, Jharna?

909
01:01:38,668 --> 01:01:40,008
Is that a cat?

910
01:01:40,345 --> 01:01:41,807
No, it's your dad!
- Who is that?

911
01:01:42,853 --> 01:01:45,543
You idiot! - Sorry!
- Okay, you guys go now.

912
01:01:45,623 --> 01:01:46,745
Quickly go away from here!

913
01:01:49,892 --> 01:01:50,964
Where did we climb from?

914
01:01:52,756 --> 01:01:55,973
Let's go. - Has anyone
entered my house? Who is it?

915
01:01:56,687 --> 01:01:58,495
Be careful.
- Let me get down.

916
01:01:58,836 --> 01:02:01,387
Jharna! Jharna!
- Don't fall down, bro. - Jharna!

917
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:03,386
Bro, we will get beaten
up badly if we get caught.

918
01:02:03,472 --> 01:02:04,628
Run!

919
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,841
Run! - Switch off the main.
- Jharna!

920
01:02:09,679 --> 01:02:11,085
What happened?

921
01:02:13,450 --> 01:02:15,031
Power cut?

922
01:02:20,328 --> 01:02:21,544
No, it's not a power cut.

923
01:02:23,708 --> 01:02:25,113
Are there dacoits inside my house?

924
01:02:25,546 --> 01:02:27,668
Hey! Who's that?

925
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:31,343
We will be beaten to death!

926
01:02:31,546 --> 01:02:34,546
I will take action against this.
I will not spare anyone!

927
01:02:35,127 --> 01:02:38,181
Hey! Stop!

928
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:41,100
Enough is enough.
This happens time and again..

929
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:43,668
..and we end up running and escaping.
Isn't it, Arya?

930
01:02:45,114 --> 01:02:46,114
Deep!

931
01:02:49,006 --> 01:02:52,938
What is this?
- He is a nice guy. Forget everything now.

932
01:02:53,018 --> 01:02:54,560
Smile now.

933
01:02:56,357 --> 01:02:57,685
What was Bubla saying?

934
01:02:57,765 --> 01:03:01,196
'Jharna, what are you doing
in the darkness? Is it dacoits?'

935
01:03:07,642 --> 01:03:09,007
Music?

936
01:03:09,364 --> 01:03:11,291
Bro, I think the
function has started.

937
01:03:12,047 --> 01:03:14,655
Function? Let's dance.

938
01:03:16,534 --> 01:03:18,250
Are you going to dance?

939
01:03:18,777 --> 01:03:20,736
Why not? We all will dance.

940
01:03:21,587 --> 01:03:23,587
Are you sure?
- Okay.

941
01:03:24,668 --> 01:03:27,020
Let's go.
- Let's dance.

942
01:03:30,627 --> 01:03:32,533
Let's dance!

943
01:03:47,721 --> 01:03:51,140
"The spice of love has hit me."

944
01:03:51,356 --> 01:03:54,586
"O my love, I have fallen for you."

945
01:03:54,829 --> 01:03:58,167
"You play hide and seek with me
but never come in front."

946
01:03:58,247 --> 01:04:01,302
"If you appear before me,
I will slay you with my glance!"

947
01:04:01,545 --> 01:04:04,896
"Give me, Oh dear.."

948
01:04:04,976 --> 01:04:08,303
"..give me the assurance
of your love."

949
01:04:08,492 --> 01:04:12,181
"Give me, Oh dear.."

950
01:04:12,261 --> 01:04:15,654
"..give me the assurance
of your love."

951
01:04:15,734 --> 01:04:19,046
"The spice of love has hit me."

952
01:04:19,126 --> 01:04:22,722
"O my love, I have fallen for you."

953
01:04:22,802 --> 01:04:26,087
"You play hide and seek with
me but never come in front."

954
01:04:26,167 --> 01:04:29,195
"If you appear before me,
I will slay you with my glance!"

955
01:04:29,275 --> 01:04:36,208
"Give me, oh dear, give me
the assurance of your love."

956
01:04:36,288 --> 01:04:39,965
"Give me, oh dear.."

957
01:04:40,045 --> 01:04:43,276
"..give me the assurance
of your love."

958
01:05:11,316 --> 01:05:14,678
"Why do you bother about
what your relatives say?"

959
01:05:14,894 --> 01:05:17,932
"Since we are in love,
let's delve deeper."

960
01:05:21,824 --> 01:05:25,132
"Why do you bother about
what your relatives say?"

961
01:05:25,327 --> 01:05:28,657
"Since we are in love,
let's delve deeper."

962
01:05:28,737 --> 01:05:32,203
"My heart asks me all the time.."

963
01:05:32,283 --> 01:05:35,392
"..when will you recognise my love?"

964
01:05:35,652 --> 01:05:39,090
"Seeing your antics
my heart sinks."

965
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:42,246
"Oh my love,
I am standing at your door."

966
01:05:42,326 --> 01:05:49,230
"Give me, oh dear, give me
the assurance of your love."

967
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:56,312
"Give me, oh dear, give me
the assurance of your love."

968
01:06:12,006 --> 01:06:16,960
"Hey, listen, come closer to me."

969
01:06:17,177 --> 01:06:20,863
"I am unfriending everyone
in order to get you."

970
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:24,420
"Come to me and remove all
the grievances from my heart."

971
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:31,003
"I am unfriending everyone
in order to get you."

972
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:34,744
"Come to me and remove all
the grievances from my heart."

973
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:38,279
"Has any new film
come to the town?"

974
01:06:38,359 --> 01:06:41,857
"I want to go and watch it with
you and plant a kiss on your lips."

975
01:06:41,937 --> 01:06:45,328
"Your antics make
my heart go wild."

976
01:06:45,408 --> 01:06:47,051
I am not feeling well.
- Why?

977
01:06:47,131 --> 01:06:48,272
I'm just not feeling well.
- What happened?

978
01:06:48,813 --> 01:06:51,209
What happened? Let me check.

979
01:06:53,276 --> 01:06:55,326
I am just not feeling well.
- He has got fever.

980
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,088
Fever? - Yes.
- How come he has got fever?

981
01:07:00,178 --> 01:07:03,525
I am not liking anything.
Let me go.

982
01:07:03,776 --> 01:07:04,986
Where are you going?

983
01:07:05,471 --> 01:07:06,958
I am going home.
- Arya! - Let me go.

984
01:07:07,278 --> 01:07:08,480
Hey!
- We'll catch up later.

985
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:11,326
Arya! - Make way, please.
- Listen.

986
01:07:13,057 --> 01:07:16,222
"If you appear before me,
I will slay you with my glance!"

987
01:07:16,302 --> 01:07:23,133
"Give me, oh dear, give me
the assurance of your love."

988
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:01,659
Arya!

989
01:08:28,792 --> 01:08:29,792
Arya!

990
01:08:32,035 --> 01:08:33,035
Oh!

991
01:08:34,396 --> 01:08:35,944
He has got high fever!

992
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:42,851
Arya!

993
01:08:54,955 --> 01:08:56,036
Mom!

994
01:08:56,650 --> 01:08:57,650
Mom!

995
01:08:59,937 --> 01:09:01,200
He has got high fever!

996
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:53,750
Arya!

997
01:11:15,031 --> 01:11:16,031
Arya!

998
01:11:16,848 --> 01:11:17,848
Arya, what...

999
01:11:18,185 --> 01:11:20,703
What happened? - What are you
saying? How did he get fever?

1000
01:11:20,887 --> 01:11:21,786
Move aside. Let me see.
- No, you don't have to come here.

1001
01:11:21,866 --> 01:11:22,584
You better stay there.

1002
01:11:22,664 --> 01:11:24,952
It was bound to happen.
He isn't doing anything on time.

1003
01:11:25,032 --> 01:11:26,883
He isn't eating or
doing anything on time.

1004
01:11:26,963 --> 01:11:28,844
Go and bring Dr, Baren.
- Yes.

1005
01:11:28,924 --> 01:11:31,382
Go at once. - Sure.
- Give my reference..

1006
01:11:31,462 --> 01:11:33,733
..and ask the doctor to come since our
nephew has got fever.

1007
01:11:34,396 --> 01:11:35,542
The fever is quite high.

1008
01:11:35,622 --> 01:11:37,916
Why don't you change the water of
the cold compress?

1009
01:11:38,087 --> 01:11:40,714
Sure.
- Does he have high fever?

1010
01:11:40,951 --> 01:11:42,519
Why are you being so excited?

1011
01:11:42,918 --> 01:11:44,763
We are giving him cold
compress till the doctor arrives.

1012
01:11:44,843 --> 01:11:46,702
It might bring the fever down.

1013
01:13:15,497 --> 01:13:18,507
Hey, Son,
did you have too much fun that..

1014
01:13:19,121 --> 01:13:20,121
..you have got fever?

1015
01:13:20,817 --> 01:13:22,502
Yes. Uncle was saying
that I'm not used to..

1016
01:13:22,582 --> 01:13:24,360
..the weather over here.
Hence the fever.

1017
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,704
Besides, the weather becomes
quite cold during early mornings.

1018
01:13:26,784 --> 01:13:28,762
Today is Dashami.
When are you planning to come back?

1019
01:13:28,842 --> 01:13:30,042
I will be back two days later.

1020
01:13:30,347 --> 01:13:33,660
And, listen, you just pack
your stuff and come here.

1021
01:13:34,601 --> 01:13:36,080
I want you to be here by evening.

1022
01:13:37,983 --> 01:13:41,442
No, no,
they won't like me going there.

1023
01:13:41,723 --> 01:13:43,995
You won't understand.
- Eldest uncle has asked you to come.

1024
01:13:45,092 --> 01:13:47,732
Did your eldest uncle say this?
- Yes, he has said this to me, Dad.

1025
01:13:48,196 --> 01:13:51,119
Besides, my relations over here
has shown me a different life, Dad.

1026
01:13:51,881 --> 01:13:53,697
Grandma, uncles, aunts, Bunty...

1027
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:55,687
I feel that I am not alone.

1028
01:13:56,033 --> 01:13:57,633
There is someone whom
I can call my own.

1029
01:13:57,979 --> 01:14:00,260
Besides, you have no idea how
much eldest uncle loves me.

1030
01:14:01,096 --> 01:14:02,572
He appears to be grumpy but he isn't.

1031
01:14:04,782 --> 01:14:06,860
I really like hearing this from you.

1032
01:14:07,863 --> 01:14:09,940
I have never seen you
become so emotional before.

1033
01:14:12,457 --> 01:14:13,815
Did you like any girl over there?

1034
01:14:14,653 --> 01:14:16,634
The girls of Durgapur are really pretty.

1035
01:14:17,732 --> 01:14:19,297
But the girl has to be of my liking.

1036
01:14:20,837 --> 01:14:22,368
You can't just choose
any random girl.

1037
01:14:22,448 --> 01:14:23,760
Dad, please, just stop it.

1038
01:14:24,305 --> 01:14:26,612
And listen, I will inform eldest
uncle that you are coming.

1039
01:14:26,692 --> 01:14:28,681
Okay? Bye.
- Bye.

1040
01:14:44,065 --> 01:14:45,544
Thanks.
- Why?

1041
01:14:47,256 --> 01:14:49,246
You all have done so much for me.

1042
01:14:50,197 --> 01:14:51,197
Your fever has gone down.

1043
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,047
Actually, I was very much tensed.

1044
01:14:54,834 --> 01:14:57,852
You had fever and
you were drunk too.

1045
01:14:59,323 --> 01:15:01,723
Piu, I am really sorry for
whatever has happened that night.

1046
01:15:03,897 --> 01:15:05,981
The first day I saw you, I felt..

1047
01:15:06,612 --> 01:15:08,109
..did you come here for me?

1048
01:15:10,997 --> 01:15:13,488
Do you remember the
incident at the bathroom?

1049
01:15:15,053 --> 01:15:17,053
I started liking you the
very first day I saw you.

1050
01:15:17,855 --> 01:15:18,855
I love you!

1051
01:15:35,377 --> 01:15:36,377
Piu!

1052
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:39,680
Listen.

1053
01:15:43,654 --> 01:15:44,683
What are you saying?

1054
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:47,451
Please don't see it that way.

1055
01:15:47,531 --> 01:15:48,904
Whatever had happened that night...

1056
01:15:50,469 --> 01:15:51,472
..that was an accident.

1057
01:15:54,275 --> 01:15:56,515
That was not love.
I was intoxicated.

1058
01:15:56,595 --> 01:15:58,253
I had fever.
You could have stopped me.

1059
01:15:59,247 --> 01:16:00,267
Why didn't you stop me?

1060
01:16:01,244 --> 01:16:03,026
There isn't any love between us, okay?

1061
01:16:03,622 --> 01:16:06,234
It was just something physical.
I don't know, okay?

1062
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:07,528
I am sorry.

1063
01:16:07,981 --> 01:16:09,892
It's a mistake. It's wrong.

1064
01:16:12,037 --> 01:16:15,237
Sorry. We both have committed a mistake.
Piu, please.

1065
01:16:55,633 --> 01:16:57,371
What are you saying?
- Why are you shouting?

1066
01:16:57,451 --> 01:16:58,451
Did you sleep with her?

1067
01:16:58,764 --> 01:17:00,519
I mean,
did you literally sleep with her?

1068
01:17:01,401 --> 01:17:03,442
I was not in my senses.
I was drunk.

1069
01:17:03,918 --> 01:17:05,068
Couldn't that girl stop me?

1070
01:17:05,536 --> 01:17:06,900
Would you stop if she would
have tried to stop you?

1071
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:08,346
You were drunk then, weren't you?

1072
01:17:09,306 --> 01:17:10,422
You did without protection?

1073
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:13,112
Obviously.
Do you think that I am like you?

1074
01:17:14,858 --> 01:17:16,666
Is the girl going to do any scandal?

1075
01:17:16,746 --> 01:17:19,025
We will be doomed if she creates
a scandal. - It will be a scandal.

1076
01:17:19,105 --> 01:17:20,945
You have to marry her
if she becomes pregnant.

1077
01:17:21,993 --> 01:17:22,798
What?!
- Yes.

1078
01:17:22,996 --> 01:17:24,916
What nonsense!
- Listen, Arya..

1079
01:17:25,189 --> 01:17:27,278
..we have to handle the
matter quite coolly.

1080
01:17:27,358 --> 01:17:29,518
You don't know how serious
these small town girls are.

1081
01:17:29,664 --> 01:17:32,198
Love is not a game for them.

1082
01:17:34,551 --> 01:17:35,978
What are you saying?

1083
01:17:36,315 --> 01:17:38,045
If she commits suicide
then you are doomed.

1084
01:17:45,812 --> 01:17:47,810
Are you mad?

1085
01:17:48,873 --> 01:17:51,113
Girls don't suicide over such
trivial issues these days.

1086
01:17:52,982 --> 01:17:55,558
I am going home.
- Hey, Arya!

1087
01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:01,388
Didn't I tell you that
I could sense trouble?

1088
01:18:01,768 --> 01:18:03,833
I am calling you since long
but you are just not answering.

1089
01:18:03,913 --> 01:18:05,993
I have laid the food on the table.
Come and eat now.

1090
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:09,388
Hey, Piu! - What?
- Come and have food.

1091
01:18:12,233 --> 01:18:14,066
I won't eat. I'm not hungry.

1092
01:18:14,897 --> 01:18:15,897
Please go.

1093
01:18:18,839 --> 01:18:19,919
What's the matter with you?

1094
01:18:20,897 --> 01:18:21,897
What is it?

1095
01:18:22,679 --> 01:18:24,564
Let me see your face.

1096
01:18:28,197 --> 01:18:29,197
Were you crying?

1097
01:18:30,818 --> 01:18:31,818
What happened, dear?

1098
01:18:31,951 --> 01:18:32,951
Tell me, please.

1099
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:36,718
Hey, what happened?
- Who... who was crying?

1100
01:18:36,798 --> 01:18:37,711
I was not crying.

1101
01:18:38,956 --> 01:18:40,036
Nothing has happened to me.

1102
01:18:40,193 --> 01:18:41,993
Tell me please.
Something must have happened.

1103
01:18:42,165 --> 01:18:43,845
Nothing has happened.
Please go from here.

1104
01:18:43,973 --> 01:18:45,547
Please go.
- Piu!

1105
01:18:45,746 --> 01:18:48,323
Tell me, please...
- Mom, please go.

1106
01:18:48,403 --> 01:18:51,264
Listen to me. What happened?
- I want to be alone, mom. Please go.

1107
01:18:51,773 --> 01:18:53,598
Piu! Piu!

1108
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:57,559
What is she up to?

1109
01:19:08,292 --> 01:19:11,112
Uncultured! Bad guy!

1110
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:13,340
He is very bad!

1111
01:19:14,769 --> 01:19:17,087
Is making love called accident?

1112
01:19:21,057 --> 01:19:23,461
'Look, unprotected sex
is always bit risky.'

1113
01:19:24,119 --> 01:19:27,449
'But... - And, yes, it can
transmit various kinds of disease.'

1114
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:29,429
'There are chances
of pregnancy too.'

1115
01:19:30,813 --> 01:19:33,745
Oh my God!
What if something bad happens?

1116
01:19:34,306 --> 01:19:35,638
It will be a disaster!

1117
01:19:36,235 --> 01:19:37,506
What will I do now?

1118
01:19:38,986 --> 01:19:40,266
Who should I talk to about this?

1119
01:20:13,814 --> 01:20:15,614
'If she commits suicide
then you are doomed.'

1120
01:20:17,577 --> 01:20:18,577
Piu!

1121
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:20,160
Piu!

1122
01:20:24,374 --> 01:20:28,516
Hey, what are you doing?
Please don't do anything wrong.

1123
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:31,331
We can talk about it, can't we?

1124
01:20:32,530 --> 01:20:33,530
Piu, please.

1125
01:20:34,355 --> 01:20:35,835
What are you going
to do with a rope?

1126
01:20:36,439 --> 01:20:38,281
I mean, we should talk, shouldn't we?

1127
01:20:39,743 --> 01:20:42,718
Keep down the rope.
Why do you need a rope?

1128
01:20:43,799 --> 01:20:46,351
Piu! Hey, Piu!

1129
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:48,453
Why did you close the window?

1130
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:51,982
Open the window.
What are you doing inside?

1131
01:21:17,028 --> 01:21:18,028
Thank God!

1132
01:21:19,614 --> 01:21:21,673
Piu, please listen to me.

1133
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:26,334
Unprotected...
- Sex?

1134
01:21:27,156 --> 01:21:30,754
Yes. - Piu, we can't do anything
about what has already happened.

1135
01:21:32,163 --> 01:21:33,513
I should have medicine.

1136
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:36,946
Why?
- What if I become pregnant?

1137
01:21:41,608 --> 01:21:44,056
All that happens in films,
not in real life.

1138
01:21:44,479 --> 01:21:46,019
But I am scared.

1139
01:21:46,822 --> 01:21:49,555
Even if anything happens, I'm
not being able to say this to anyone..

1140
01:21:49,635 --> 01:21:50,697
..except you.

1141
01:21:51,293 --> 01:21:53,973
If someone doesn't go with me,
I won't be able to buy the medicine.

1142
01:21:54,415 --> 01:21:55,765
I am too tensed.

1143
01:21:56,136 --> 01:21:57,485
I don't know what to do.

1144
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:00,232
Will you please come with
me to the chemist shop?

1145
01:22:00,901 --> 01:22:02,181
Why? Don't you have the money?

1146
01:22:06,601 --> 01:22:07,932
Sorry. I am sorry.

1147
01:22:09,065 --> 01:22:10,293
Please help me out.

1148
01:22:11,461 --> 01:22:13,536
I will never come in front
of you after this day.

1149
01:22:16,036 --> 01:22:17,040
Okay, I'll go with you.

1150
01:22:17,835 --> 01:22:20,195
But promise me that you'll
forget the incident after today.

1151
01:22:21,554 --> 01:22:23,154
This is not love. It's an accident.

1152
01:22:23,234 --> 01:22:24,234
Just forget it.

1153
01:22:26,085 --> 01:22:28,685
And don't do anything embarrassing
and get me into trouble.

1154
01:22:29,112 --> 01:22:30,210
Promise me.

1155
01:22:53,164 --> 01:22:54,164
Let's go.

1156
01:23:27,552 --> 01:23:29,697
Yes?
- Where are you, bro?

1157
01:23:30,450 --> 01:23:31,851
Don't ask. I am stuck.

1158
01:23:32,594 --> 01:23:34,341
Why? Has something already happened?

1159
01:23:36,183 --> 01:23:38,432
I had to come with Piu
to buy some medicine.

1160
01:23:38,951 --> 01:23:40,214
Medicine?

1161
01:23:40,473 --> 01:23:42,886
Has the matter gone so far?
- Arya, bro, what have you done?

1162
01:23:43,076 --> 01:23:45,947
Having a family at this age...
- Keep quiet, you idiot!

1163
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:52,650
There is a medical shop that way.

1164
01:23:54,104 --> 01:23:55,730
Go then.
- Alone?

1165
01:23:56,586 --> 01:23:58,903
You too come with me.
- What will I do over there?

1166
01:23:59,656 --> 01:24:01,856
I will wait for you over here.
Go and get the medicine.

1167
01:24:03,021 --> 01:24:04,154
Go.

1168
01:24:22,939 --> 01:24:23,939
What do you want?

1169
01:24:29,547 --> 01:24:32,003
This medicine...

1170
01:24:32,928 --> 01:24:35,315
Hey, Piu!
What medicine do you want?

1171
01:24:35,912 --> 01:24:39,259
Is anyone sick at home?
Don't you know Piu?

1172
01:24:39,339 --> 01:24:40,751
Do you remember Manik of Markoni?

1173
01:24:40,831 --> 01:24:42,139
She is his daughter.
- Yes, I remember.

1174
01:24:42,219 --> 01:24:44,446
She's all grown up. - What medicine
do you want? Show me the name.

1175
01:24:44,526 --> 01:24:46,265
No, it's nothing.
- What?

1176
01:24:47,234 --> 01:24:48,954
What's the point being so scared?
Be brave.

1177
01:24:52,016 --> 01:24:53,841
The man is known to me.
He is uncle Soumen.

1178
01:24:54,456 --> 01:24:55,710
He was at the medical shop.

1179
01:24:56,159 --> 01:24:57,359
So what if he is known to you?

1180
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:59,960
You could have said that you
are taking it for someone else.

1181
01:25:00,535 --> 01:25:02,615
You can't be afraid of every
trivial issues of life.

1182
01:25:03,701 --> 01:25:05,465
Why don't you go to the
medical shop? - What?

1183
01:25:06,597 --> 01:25:07,789
Why don't you buy the medicine?

1184
01:25:07,869 --> 01:25:09,512
There is a medical shop over there.

1185
01:25:36,219 --> 01:25:37,335
Sir.
- Tell me.

1186
01:25:38,884 --> 01:25:41,011
I was looking for a medicine...

1187
01:25:41,867 --> 01:25:42,947
Which medicine do you want?

1188
01:25:44,678 --> 01:25:45,678
No...

1189
01:25:46,718 --> 01:25:48,318
Actually...
- Do you have a prescription?

1190
01:25:48,638 --> 01:25:49,737
Do you have a prescription?

1191
01:25:50,308 --> 01:25:52,444
No. - Hey, Sanjeev,
didn't I tell you yesterday...

1192
01:25:54,088 --> 01:25:55,089
Hey!

1193
01:25:55,342 --> 01:25:57,020
What are you doing here?

1194
01:25:57,712 --> 01:25:59,208
Yes. I need to buy antacid.

1195
01:25:59,528 --> 01:26:00,528
Antacid?

1196
01:26:01,094 --> 01:26:02,789
Why? Are you suffering
from acidity?

1197
01:26:02,962 --> 01:26:04,402
Hey, Sanjeev,
give him some antacid.

1198
01:26:05,314 --> 01:26:07,554
He is my nephew. - I see.
- He has come down from Mumbai.

1199
01:26:09,396 --> 01:26:11,480
I don't need antacid.
Can you give me some Vicks?

1200
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:13,088
What exactly do you want?

1201
01:26:13,321 --> 01:26:17,188
Vicks? Take it then. Here you go.

1202
01:26:18,606 --> 01:26:19,606
Go now.

1203
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:27,540
Doesn't my nephew
resemble my sister?

1204
01:26:28,137 --> 01:26:29,137
Let's go from here.

1205
01:26:29,875 --> 01:26:31,955
Why? - My youngest uncle
was in that shop. Take this.

1206
01:26:33,949 --> 01:26:35,893
What will I do with this?
- I don't know, Come along now.

1207
01:26:35,973 --> 01:26:37,213
We can't buy the medicine here.

1208
01:26:38,039 --> 01:26:39,919
We can't buy the medicine
in our neighbourhood.

1209
01:26:40,210 --> 01:26:42,491
We have to go some place where
no one would recognise us.

1210
01:26:42,908 --> 01:26:43,920
We can go to Benachiti.

1211
01:26:44,863 --> 01:26:45,863
How far is it?

1212
01:26:46,873 --> 01:26:48,046
It's a half an hour journey.

1213
01:27:13,309 --> 01:27:14,309
Are you hungry?

1214
01:27:18,637 --> 01:27:19,837
Let me know if you are hungry.

1215
01:27:20,168 --> 01:27:21,968
We can eat something
once we reach Benachiti.

1216
01:27:22,305 --> 01:27:23,377
I am not hungry.

1217
01:27:24,086 --> 01:27:25,444
Let me know if you are hungry.

1218
01:27:26,819 --> 01:27:28,765
You can't tolerate hunger at all.

1219
01:27:30,728 --> 01:27:33,254
Piu, it's a trivial issue.
Why are you so worried about it?

1220
01:27:33,461 --> 01:27:34,701
Don't think so deeply about it.

1221
01:27:35,027 --> 01:27:36,027
Come on, cheer up!

1222
01:27:38,754 --> 01:27:39,723
Shouldn't I be worried?

1223
01:27:39,803 --> 01:27:41,443
No. What there to be
so worried about it?

1224
01:27:58,638 --> 01:28:00,878
Come with me. We have to climb
at the back of the truck.

1225
01:28:15,010 --> 01:28:16,010
Here you go.

1226
01:28:17,164 --> 01:28:18,164
Take this.

1227
01:28:42,614 --> 01:28:44,724
What else do I need to bring?

1228
01:28:45,719 --> 01:28:46,719
Here is your tea.

1229
01:28:47,527 --> 01:28:50,234
Have you made the list already?
Did you write Pabda fish?

1230
01:28:50,314 --> 01:28:51,401
Yes, I have written it.

1231
01:28:51,652 --> 01:28:53,520
Don't spoil it while cooking.

1232
01:28:53,685 --> 01:28:56,279
Oh my! - I have written
'Mishti Doi' in the list.

1233
01:28:57,144 --> 01:28:58,020
Biswadeep is coming to our place..

1234
01:28:58,100 --> 01:28:59,987
..for the first time as the
son-in-law of this family.

1235
01:29:00,067 --> 01:29:02,427
We should leave no stones
unturned to make him comfortable.

1236
01:29:02,986 --> 01:29:05,766
Hey, where is Arya?

1237
01:29:06,219 --> 01:29:08,603
I didn't see him since morning.

1238
01:29:09,430 --> 01:29:11,016
Did he have his breakfast?

1239
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,258
He just got well.

1240
01:29:14,906 --> 01:29:16,745
God knows what will
happen to him now.

1241
01:29:16,825 --> 01:29:17,974
No, mother-in-law,
I have checked him.

1242
01:29:18,054 --> 01:29:20,064
He doesn't have fever now.
And he went out just a while ago.

1243
01:29:20,144 --> 01:29:21,278
He has informed me before going.

1244
01:29:21,358 --> 01:29:24,455
I see. Then he must have..

1245
01:29:25,034 --> 01:29:27,647
..gone to the Puja Pandal.
- Yes.

1246
01:29:28,675 --> 01:29:31,096
Oh, listen, Kanai has delivered
the mutton in the morning.

1247
01:29:31,787 --> 01:29:34,712
Sister-in-law. Have you seen Piu?

1248
01:29:34,890 --> 01:29:36,284
Her mom is looking for her.

1249
01:29:36,364 --> 01:29:38,291
She went out in the morning without
having breakfast.

1250
01:29:38,533 --> 01:29:41,311
I saw Piu going towards
Arya's room just a while ago.

1251
01:29:41,391 --> 01:29:42,972
Why are you searching for them?

1252
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:45,083
The festival hasn't ended yet.

1253
01:29:45,264 --> 01:29:47,816
Let the Festival end and then
you can lock them down again.

1254
01:29:48,835 --> 01:29:51,656
Just listen to him.

1255
01:29:51,862 --> 01:29:54,056
What should I cook then?
Should I cook Dal with fish head?

1256
01:29:54,662 --> 01:29:56,751
Yes, of course.
I have written fish head in the list.

1257
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:34,422
You can wear an iron
bangle in your hand.

1258
01:30:34,677 --> 01:30:36,753
How will people understand
that you two are married?

1259
01:30:39,594 --> 01:30:40,727
No, I mean...

1260
01:30:40,926 --> 01:30:42,309
How much is it?
- 80 rupees.

1261
01:31:02,184 --> 01:31:03,184
Come along.

1262
01:31:20,882 --> 01:31:22,932
Do you have any problem
sitting with me?

1263
01:31:23,275 --> 01:31:24,238
Oh! No.

1264
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:27,400
Bro, can you come here?

1265
01:31:28,819 --> 01:31:29,565
What can we get to eat now?

1266
01:31:29,797 --> 01:31:32,601
It's quite late now. You won't
get anything veg and non-veg meal.

1267
01:31:32,936 --> 01:31:35,049
Rice, Dal, fried vegetable,
vegetable curry and fish.

1268
01:31:35,912 --> 01:31:36,912
Should we take that?

1269
01:31:39,579 --> 01:31:40,833
Give us two non-veg meal.

1270
01:31:43,047 --> 01:31:44,047
Have a seat please.

1271
01:31:45,996 --> 01:31:47,996
Have a seat. I will go and
wash my hands and face.

1272
01:32:23,123 --> 01:32:24,233
You are very good girl, Piu.

1273
01:32:25,712 --> 01:32:27,347
I had misunderstood you. I'm sorry.

1274
01:32:29,324 --> 01:32:30,856
When you were standing
at the highway and crying..

1275
01:32:30,936 --> 01:32:32,714
..it really broke my heart.
I mean it.

1276
01:32:36,661 --> 01:32:37,984
I will never inflict pain on you.

1277
01:32:38,936 --> 01:32:40,051
I promise.

1278
01:32:44,151 --> 01:32:46,694
Are you telling the truth?

1279
01:33:17,426 --> 01:33:18,750
Start eating now.

1280
01:33:21,993 --> 01:33:24,223
Will you eat my fish?

1281
01:33:26,722 --> 01:33:29,952
Why? - I can't remove bone
from the fish before eating.

1282
01:33:31,195 --> 01:33:32,655
Why did you order
for the fish then?

1283
01:33:34,303 --> 01:33:36,695
There wasn't anything else.
This is the non-veg meal.

1284
01:34:10,896 --> 01:34:13,342
Piu, I think..

1285
01:34:14,599 --> 01:34:17,140
..sooner we will come out of this
situation, it will be better..

1286
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:19,761
..for both of us.

1287
01:34:20,707 --> 01:34:21,707
So please cheer up.

1288
01:34:23,072 --> 01:34:25,139
You look much better...
- Please!

1289
01:34:27,694 --> 01:34:29,356
You don't have to
say anything else.

1290
01:34:31,991 --> 01:34:33,591
The day you'll love someone
but your love won't get reciprocated..

1291
01:34:33,671 --> 01:34:36,735
..that day you'll understand
what is happening inside my heart.

1292
01:34:37,559 --> 01:34:40,923
For you this might be an accident
but not for me.

1293
01:34:41,126 --> 01:34:44,140
I am not repenting.
I haven't done anything wrong.

1294
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:47,950
The person within you
seemed helpless to me.

1295
01:34:48,518 --> 01:34:51,788
I thought that you are not the
person who is seen from outside.

1296
01:34:53,491 --> 01:34:55,531
I have loved someone for
the first time in my life.

1297
01:34:58,559 --> 01:35:01,450
Don't belittle my love by
calling it an accident.

1298
01:35:01,748 --> 01:35:05,775
Please. Whatever has happened,
has happened according to my will.

1299
01:35:06,708 --> 01:35:08,028
You are not responsible for that.

1300
01:35:26,371 --> 01:35:29,046
"How do I make you understand.."

1301
01:35:29,452 --> 01:35:34,574
"..what all do I want?
I have complain in my eyes.."

1302
01:35:35,507 --> 01:35:38,466
"..but whom should I register it to?"

1303
01:35:38,858 --> 01:35:41,507
"The signs and symbols
have gathered."

1304
01:35:41,790 --> 01:35:44,910
"God knows where does
my heart wander."

1305
01:35:44,990 --> 01:35:47,993
"All my calculations have
gone wrong midway."

1306
01:35:48,073 --> 01:35:50,831
"And the evening has
set in silently."

1307
01:35:51,034 --> 01:35:53,898
"The signs and symbols
have gathered."

1308
01:35:53,978 --> 01:35:56,913
"God knows where does
my heart wander."

1309
01:35:56,993 --> 01:36:00,223
"All my calculations
have gone wrong midway."

1310
01:36:00,303 --> 01:36:03,021
"And the evening has
set in silently."

1311
01:36:03,210 --> 01:36:08,629
"My shameless heart doesn't
know how to hide it's feelings."

1312
01:36:09,372 --> 01:36:15,142
"And the disobedient Moon
smiles at me being amused."

1313
01:36:15,534 --> 01:36:17,805
"My unruly heart.."

1314
01:36:18,615 --> 01:36:24,034
..doesn't want to believe
the comfort of your lap.."

1315
01:36:24,601 --> 01:36:26,790
"..beside my head."

1316
01:36:33,790 --> 01:36:40,073
"My friendly heart,
expresses silently.."

1317
01:36:40,153 --> 01:36:46,032
"..who will approach first towards
the fairy tales drenched in tears?"

1318
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:49,276
"The memories of walking
together has gathered."

1319
01:36:49,491 --> 01:36:52,370
"I have played with colours
with my eyes being blindfolded."

1320
01:36:52,748 --> 01:36:55,410
"I lost everything in the midway."

1321
01:36:55,490 --> 01:36:58,504
"The hawker of the evening
has returned home."

1322
01:36:58,774 --> 01:37:01,585
"The memories of walking
together has gathered."

1323
01:37:01,951 --> 01:37:04,640
"I have played with colours
with my eyes being blindfolded."

1324
01:37:04,991 --> 01:37:08,018
"I lost everything in the midway."

1325
01:37:08,098 --> 01:37:10,680
"The hawker of the evening
has returned home."

1326
01:37:10,896 --> 01:37:13,342
"My shameless heart.."

1327
01:37:14,072 --> 01:37:17,110
"..doesn't know
how to hide it's feelings."

1328
01:37:17,190 --> 01:37:22,234
"And the disobedient Moon
smiles at me being amused."

1329
01:37:23,207 --> 01:37:28,600
"My unruly heart
doesn't want to believe.."

1330
01:37:29,384 --> 01:37:34,965
"..the comfort of your
lap beside my head."

1331
01:37:41,507 --> 01:37:43,831
"How do I see him?"

1332
01:37:44,845 --> 01:37:47,547
"He isn't anywhere close to me."

1333
01:37:47,736 --> 01:37:50,209
"My eyes are bedazzled.."

1334
01:37:50,953 --> 01:37:54,021
"..by the spark from the stars."

1335
01:37:54,101 --> 01:37:56,980
"The indulgences have gathered."

1336
01:37:57,251 --> 01:37:59,994
"And it has started
raining as well."

1337
01:38:00,231 --> 01:38:03,169
"I am depressed for no reason."

1338
01:38:03,249 --> 01:38:06,061
"Who is the one who has
boarded a return bus?"

1339
01:38:06,469 --> 01:38:09,305
"The indulgences have gathered."

1340
01:38:09,385 --> 01:38:12,251
"And it has started
raining as well."

1341
01:38:12,521 --> 01:38:15,656
"I am depressed for no reason."

1342
01:38:16,297 --> 01:38:18,035
'This is not love. It's an accident.'

1343
01:38:18,115 --> 01:38:19,400
'Just forget it.'

1344
01:38:22,129 --> 01:38:24,359
'Piu, it's a trivial issue.
Why are you so worried about it?'

1345
01:38:24,439 --> 01:38:26,061
'Don't think so deeply about it.'

1346
01:38:27,574 --> 01:38:29,182
"Smiles at me being amused."

1347
01:38:29,534 --> 01:38:31,588
'My life is meaningless without you,
Prithviraj.'

1348
01:38:32,249 --> 01:38:34,346
'If I have to live
this life without you..'

1349
01:38:34,426 --> 01:38:36,219
'..then I would rather
prefer death.'

1350
01:38:36,574 --> 01:38:39,358
'My life is meaningless without you,
Prithviraj.'

1351
01:38:39,939 --> 01:38:42,642
"Beside my head."

1352
01:38:57,372 --> 01:38:59,061
You came here for the first time.

1353
01:38:59,467 --> 01:39:01,372
But what news did
you bring for us, dear?

1354
01:39:03,494 --> 01:39:08,129
Oh God, how much more pain
will you inflict on us?

1355
01:39:09,819 --> 01:39:11,306
Please don't cry, Mother-in-law.

1356
01:39:11,765 --> 01:39:13,346
You will fall sick.

1357
01:39:15,103 --> 01:39:17,265
Look, I don't have much time.

1358
01:39:18,657 --> 01:39:20,481
At the most I have two years' time.

1359
01:39:20,684 --> 01:39:22,204
So I had to say
everything to you all.

1360
01:39:24,644 --> 01:39:29,982
Brother, you might not consider me
as a member of this family.

1361
01:39:32,351 --> 01:39:35,671
But Arya is one of the
members of your family.

1362
01:39:36,969 --> 01:39:38,009
He is Mita's son.

1363
01:39:38,089 --> 01:39:41,374
No, no, I don't remember anything.
All that has been sorted out.

1364
01:39:43,604 --> 01:39:45,902
Look, even we were also at fault.

1365
01:39:46,631 --> 01:39:48,983
But if have sorted out everything
by sending Arya to this house.

1366
01:39:49,063 --> 01:39:51,423
You have cleared all the
misunderstandings that were there.

1367
01:39:52,010 --> 01:39:53,293
After my passing..

1368
01:39:55,205 --> 01:39:57,013
..you are the only family
that Arya will have.

1369
01:39:58,387 --> 01:40:00,563
Now I feel that the
mistake was mine.

1370
01:40:02,384 --> 01:40:05,266
After Mita passed away,
if I would have defied your orders..

1371
01:40:07,483 --> 01:40:09,821
..and bring Arya during his
childhood, then probably..

1372
01:40:10,672 --> 01:40:12,415
..after coming closer to you all..

1373
01:40:14,038 --> 01:40:16,496
..it would be easier for
him to accept my demise.

1374
01:40:17,631 --> 01:40:20,847
But... but Arya doesn't know
anything about all this.

1375
01:40:21,279 --> 01:40:24,482
I have heard that cancer has
various treatments these days.

1376
01:40:24,773 --> 01:40:26,255
And if the patient
gets proper treatment..

1377
01:40:26,335 --> 01:40:29,685
..then cancer can be cured.
Specially.. in abroad... isn't it?

1378
01:40:31,050 --> 01:40:32,570
That won't do any good, Sister-in-law.

1379
01:40:33,279 --> 01:40:34,834
The doctor has no hope left.

1380
01:40:37,712 --> 01:40:39,698
Now I am alive due
to my will power.

1381
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:45,428
I am just wondering
how to disclose everything to Arya.

1382
01:40:46,499 --> 01:40:47,496
Dad!

1383
01:40:53,226 --> 01:40:54,510
What are you saying?

1384
01:40:56,591 --> 01:40:59,111
What are you saying? You are
just making fools of us, isn't it?

1385
01:41:00,469 --> 01:41:02,848
Why are you saying all this?

1386
01:41:04,712 --> 01:41:05,996
Listen...

1387
01:41:07,997 --> 01:41:12,064
Listen, Arya,
you have to face everything.

1388
01:41:15,781 --> 01:41:19,052
Why did I drag you
here from Mumbai?

1389
01:41:20,174 --> 01:41:21,795
You have grown up now.

1390
01:41:22,390 --> 01:41:25,160
Look, I knew that you...

1391
01:41:25,917 --> 01:41:28,434
Actually,
I wanted that you should get back..

1392
01:41:28,514 --> 01:41:31,495
..everyone from your maternal
uncle's family so that..

1393
01:41:32,214 --> 01:41:34,146
..so that after I pass away..

1394
01:41:34,633 --> 01:41:36,754
..you shouldn't feel lonely.
- Dad, please!

1395
01:41:37,187 --> 01:41:38,701
Why are you saying all this?

1396
01:41:40,403 --> 01:41:42,323
You must be making a fool
out of me, aren't you?

1397
01:41:42,403 --> 01:41:45,012
This is a lie, isn't it?

1398
01:41:45,417 --> 01:41:47,903
Please tell me.
You are lying, aren't you?

1399
01:41:50,309 --> 01:41:53,985
Tell me, aren't you lying to me?
- Listen, Arya...

1400
01:42:00,647 --> 01:42:02,174
Say something.
- It's true.

1401
01:42:03,836 --> 01:42:04,998
I am telling the truth.

1402
01:42:09,025 --> 01:42:10,823
Dad, please don't do this to me.

1403
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:14,701
Please!

1404
01:42:15,299 --> 01:42:17,296
What a disaster!
What are you saying, sister-in-law?

1405
01:42:17,376 --> 01:42:19,518
Yes, Arya's dad has been
diagnosed with cancer.

1406
01:42:19,598 --> 01:42:21,833
He has told us as soon as he stepped
into our house yesterday.

1407
01:42:22,377 --> 01:42:25,256
Arya is crying profusely
since he has heard the news.

1408
01:42:25,526 --> 01:42:26,999
He has become so restless, you know?

1409
01:42:27,242 --> 01:42:29,918
He hasn't eaten a morsel
since last night. - Poor boy!

1410
01:42:30,706 --> 01:42:34,107
Actually, since childhood he had
no one by his side except his dad.

1411
01:42:34,472 --> 01:42:36,040
He loves his dad so much.

1412
01:42:36,635 --> 01:42:38,297
God knows what will
happen to the boy.

1413
01:42:39,986 --> 01:42:43,229
That's called destiny. He has
lost his mom during his childhood.

1414
01:42:43,689 --> 01:42:45,249
And now his dad is
in such a condition.

1415
01:42:48,676 --> 01:42:49,865
Poor thing!

1416
01:42:50,649 --> 01:42:51,892
God knows what will happen now.

1417
01:42:52,582 --> 01:42:54,946
Look at her! Piu!

1418
01:42:55,216 --> 01:42:57,216
Oh, yes, hello.
Can I talk to doctor...

1419
01:42:57,932 --> 01:42:59,743
Hello! Hello!

1420
01:43:00,622 --> 01:43:02,554
Arya, keep the phone now.

1421
01:43:03,203 --> 01:43:04,527
All that won't be of any help.

1422
01:43:04,607 --> 01:43:06,127
Why won't it be of any help, Dad?
Why?

1423
01:43:06,284 --> 01:43:08,054
Look at Yuvaraj Singh. He is back.

1424
01:43:08,829 --> 01:43:11,053
I have my friends in abroad.
We can use the internet.

1425
01:43:11,163 --> 01:43:12,744
Dad, please, let's fight. Please.

1426
01:43:13,811 --> 01:43:15,298
Look, Arya..

1427
01:43:16,338 --> 01:43:18,538
..when I think that I have to
go away leaving you behind..

1428
01:43:19,567 --> 01:43:21,581
..my heart also breaks.

1429
01:43:23,324 --> 01:43:25,770
Rather, as long as I am alive..

1430
01:43:26,243 --> 01:43:28,851
..let me live for you.
Let me live joyfully.

1431
01:43:30,235 --> 01:43:32,121
Let me get you married.
- Dad, please..

1432
01:43:32,467 --> 01:43:33,713
..are you still in
a mood to crack jokes?

1433
01:43:34,513 --> 01:43:37,026
I am not cracking jokes.

1434
01:43:37,106 --> 01:43:39,013
Look, after my passing..

1435
01:43:39,093 --> 01:43:42,878
..you will need someone to take care
of you and keep you organised.

1436
01:43:44,065 --> 01:43:45,526
For that we need a girl.

1437
01:43:46,323 --> 01:43:48,329
Okay, we will think about that later.
But now you should eat something.

1438
01:43:48,409 --> 01:43:50,309
You haven't eaten anything
since yesterday.

1439
01:43:54,512 --> 01:43:55,769
Who are you?

1440
01:43:59,891 --> 01:44:01,485
Are you Arya's friend?

1441
01:44:05,458 --> 01:44:07,377
Did you meet her after coming here?

1442
01:44:09,174 --> 01:44:10,553
God bless you, my dear.

1443
01:44:12,710 --> 01:44:15,728
I am Piu.
I am the next door neighbour.

1444
01:44:17,445 --> 01:44:20,972
Next door neighbour? I had
watched a film when I was a child..

1445
01:44:21,052 --> 01:44:22,364
..named, 'Girl next door'.

1446
01:44:24,243 --> 01:44:25,972
Anyway, this friend of yours..

1447
01:44:26,283 --> 01:44:27,946
..can't tolerate hunger at all.

1448
01:44:28,389 --> 01:44:29,442
He hasn't eaten anything
since last night.

1449
01:44:30,059 --> 01:44:32,526
Just try if you can feed
something to him. Please.

1450
01:44:52,783 --> 01:44:55,526
I know what your dad means to you.

1451
01:44:57,890 --> 01:44:59,498
It's very painful, isn't it?

1452
01:45:02,163 --> 01:45:05,837
Even I was also in tremendous pain
three years back..

1453
01:45:06,647 --> 01:45:08,850
..when my dad had passed away.

1454
01:45:12,337 --> 01:45:16,269
But, you can break down like
this, Arya.

1455
01:45:18,648 --> 01:45:20,459
Please don't cry.

1456
01:45:21,756 --> 01:45:23,635
Your dad has no one
else other than you.

1457
01:45:34,918 --> 01:45:37,216
And you'll fall sick
if you don't eat.

1458
01:45:40,810 --> 01:45:42,337
Come on, eat now.

1459
01:45:45,702 --> 01:45:47,067
What happened? Eat please.

1460
01:46:16,635 --> 01:46:19,351
Dad will be fine, won't he?
- He will be perfectly alright.

1461
01:46:19,986 --> 01:46:21,486
Eat now.

1462
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:27,720
This time you go back to Mumbai,
you'll have many responsibilities.

1463
01:46:28,811 --> 01:46:30,491
Till date your dad
has taken care of you..

1464
01:46:32,053 --> 01:46:34,053
..but now you'll have to
take care of your dad.

1465
01:46:35,743 --> 01:46:37,392
You eat. I have to go.

1466
01:46:39,324 --> 01:46:40,324
Piu!

1467
01:46:42,933 --> 01:46:44,217
Thank you.

1468
01:46:45,717 --> 01:46:47,501
I hope you are no
longer annoyed with me.

1469
01:46:48,609 --> 01:46:49,961
We are friends, right?

1470
01:46:55,164 --> 01:46:56,731
Are you on Facebook?

1471
01:46:59,596 --> 01:47:01,366
Please give me your number too.

1472
01:47:04,393 --> 01:47:05,758
Shall I tell you something?

1473
01:47:07,163 --> 01:47:08,403
You will be here till tomorrow.

1474
01:47:10,244 --> 01:47:15,379
Seeing you so sad
won't make me feel good.

1475
01:47:25,555 --> 01:47:26,354
You guys could have gone tomorrow.

1476
01:47:26,434 --> 01:47:29,367
The immersion of the Goddess will happen
after tonight's function.

1477
01:47:29,447 --> 01:47:31,123
My brother..

1478
01:47:31,447 --> 01:47:33,807
..we will come again next year.
- Promise me that you'll come.

1479
01:47:34,096 --> 01:47:36,487
Promise me that you guys
will come here. - Promise.

1480
01:47:37,220 --> 01:47:38,664
I have to come.

1481
01:47:39,003 --> 01:47:41,718
This time the Jharna
affair remained unfinished.

1482
01:47:42,002 --> 01:47:44,313
Unfinished?
- Yes, unfinished.

1483
01:47:44,797 --> 01:47:46,691
You could have stayed
back for some more days..

1484
01:47:47,083 --> 01:47:49,610
..and spend the Diwali with us.

1485
01:47:49,997 --> 01:47:52,109
No, dear, that won't be possible.

1486
01:47:53,413 --> 01:47:55,380
But now,
we will keep visiting each other.

1487
01:47:55,664 --> 01:47:57,745
And I have already handed over Arya..

1488
01:47:58,866 --> 01:48:00,217
..to you all.

1489
01:48:01,730 --> 01:48:03,302
Sister-in-law!
- Yes?

1490
01:48:03,382 --> 01:48:06,555
Please treat Arya as your own son.

1491
01:48:07,446 --> 01:48:10,136
He has no one else
other than you all.

1492
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:13,284
You don't worry at all.

1493
01:48:14,744 --> 01:48:17,068
Everything will be fine, Biswa.
Believe me.

1494
01:48:18,379 --> 01:48:21,028
Are you saying that? - Yes.
- Okay, I believe you.

1495
01:48:24,716 --> 01:48:25,771
Bye, Brother.

1496
01:48:32,108 --> 01:48:34,554
I believe that everything
can't get destroyed so easily.

1497
01:48:35,135 --> 01:48:37,216
It just can't happen.

1498
01:48:39,271 --> 01:48:41,419
Even I also believe that.

1499
01:48:42,487 --> 01:48:44,622
But what script the
God is writing for me..

1500
01:48:45,419 --> 01:48:46,987
..no one knows about that.

1501
01:49:08,731 --> 01:49:10,123
Piu gave it to you.

1502
01:49:13,907 --> 01:49:15,717
Piu?
- Yes.

1503
01:49:19,853 --> 01:49:22,042
Piu gave this one too.
- Even this one? - Yes.

1504
01:49:23,811 --> 01:49:25,095
Thank you.
- Welcome.

1505
01:49:48,055 --> 01:49:52,406
Arya! Let's go. We're getting late.
We've to reach Kolkata.

1506
01:49:52,609 --> 01:49:55,096
Is there anything else?
Let's go now.

1507
01:50:48,636 --> 01:50:51,460
Here you are. God bless you.

1508
01:50:53,069 --> 01:50:54,394
Take care of yourself.

1509
01:51:15,204 --> 01:51:16,528
Get inside the car.

1510
01:51:17,055 --> 01:51:18,109
Bye, everyone.

1511
01:52:20,799 --> 01:52:23,029
"How do I make you understand.."

1512
01:52:23,948 --> 01:52:26,691
"..what all I want?"

1513
01:52:27,042 --> 01:52:29,353
"I have complain in my eyes.."

1514
01:52:30,137 --> 01:52:32,881
"..but whom should I register it to?"

1515
01:52:33,340 --> 01:52:36,137
"The signs and symbols
have gathered."

1516
01:52:36,434 --> 01:52:39,380
"God knows where does
my heart wander."

1517
01:52:39,650 --> 01:52:42,461
"All my calculations
have gone wrong."

1518
01:52:42,541 --> 01:52:45,055
"And the evening has
set in silently."

1519
01:52:45,515 --> 01:52:48,569
"The signs and symbols
have gathered."

1520
01:52:48,785 --> 01:52:51,677
"God knows where does
my heart wander."

1521
01:52:51,874 --> 01:52:54,825
"I have made mistakes
in the midway."

1522
01:52:54,905 --> 01:52:57,650
"And the evening has
set in silently."

1523
01:52:57,893 --> 01:53:00,379
"My shameless heart.."

1524
01:53:00,825 --> 01:53:03,365
"..doesn't know how to
hide it's feelings."

1525
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:06,297
"And the disobedient Moon.."

1526
01:53:06,717 --> 01:53:09,041
"..smiles at me being amused."

1527
01:53:10,041 --> 01:53:12,257
"My unruly heart.."

1528
01:53:13,135 --> 01:53:15,838
"..doesn't want to believe.."

1529
01:53:16,256 --> 01:53:18,296
"..the comfort of your lap.."

1530
01:53:18,539 --> 01:53:21,012
'I don't know what to address you.'

1531
01:53:22,304 --> 01:53:23,957
'So I am not addressing
you anything.'

1532
01:53:24,037 --> 01:53:25,868
'I started liking you the very
first day I saw you.

1533
01:53:26,716 --> 01:53:27,974
'I love you!'

1534
01:53:28,054 --> 01:53:30,797
'You may pretend
to be grumpy apparently..'

1535
01:53:31,459 --> 01:53:32,905
'..but you are still a bit childish.'

1536
01:53:37,121 --> 01:53:40,615
'I hope from now onwards no
one will have to remove..'

1537
01:53:40,695 --> 01:53:42,156
'..bones from fish
while you will eat.'

1538
01:53:45,715 --> 01:53:47,526
'You are not at all
an emotional person.'

1539
01:53:48,140 --> 01:53:49,905
'It's good to be a bit emotional.'

1540
01:53:50,402 --> 01:53:53,027
'Or else you will inflict pain on
many people through out your life.'

1541
01:53:53,107 --> 01:53:55,229
'For you this might be an accident..'

1542
01:53:55,567 --> 01:53:56,878
'..but not for me.'

1543
01:53:57,215 --> 01:54:01,188
'I have deactivated my Facebook ID
this morning itself.'

1544
01:54:01,905 --> 01:54:03,986
'It's not required anymore.'

1545
01:54:05,049 --> 01:54:07,148
'Even the phone number
will also not be required.'

1546
01:54:08,094 --> 01:54:11,837
'We will never meet or
talk to each other again.'

1547
01:54:15,283 --> 01:54:17,580
'You don't know how serious
these small town girls are.'

1548
01:54:18,052 --> 01:54:19,810
'If she commits suicide
then you are doomed.'

1549
01:54:19,890 --> 01:54:21,961
'We will never meet or
talk to each other again.'

1550
01:54:22,041 --> 01:54:24,253
'For you this might be an
accident but not for me.'

1551
01:54:24,582 --> 01:54:26,104
'You don't know how
serious these..'

1552
01:54:26,184 --> 01:54:27,643
'..small town girls are.'
- 'I have deactivated..'

1553
01:54:27,723 --> 01:54:30,484
'..my Facebook ID this morning itself.
I haven't done anything wrong.'

1554
01:54:37,905 --> 01:54:40,592
"Oh my friendly heart.."

1555
01:54:40,917 --> 01:54:43,876
"..tell her silently,
all that you want to say."

1556
01:54:44,147 --> 01:54:46,701
"Who will approach first.."

1557
01:54:47,214 --> 01:54:49,984
"..towards the fairy tales
drenched in tears?'

1558
01:54:50,457 --> 01:54:53,309
"The memories of walking
together has gathered."

1559
01:54:53,606 --> 01:54:56,444
"I have played with colours
with my eyes being blindfolded."

1560
01:54:56,700 --> 01:54:59,511
"I lost everything in the midway."

1561
01:54:59,591 --> 01:55:02,688
"The hawker of the evening
has returned home."

1562
01:55:02,768 --> 01:55:04,607
"The memories of walking together
has gathered." - Get ready quickly.

1563
01:55:04,735 --> 01:55:08,309
Piu, take this bottle.

1564
01:55:08,525 --> 01:55:10,168
I have filled it with honey.

1565
01:55:10,328 --> 01:55:12,887
You have to perform very well in
the suicide scene.

1566
01:55:12,967 --> 01:55:15,403
Take the spot light on your face.

1567
01:55:15,545 --> 01:55:18,295
Perform well
or else the bottle won't register.

1568
01:55:18,506 --> 01:55:22,322
Okay. And one more thing...
Let me see how do you look.

1569
01:55:22,467 --> 01:55:25,078
Wow! Perfect!
You are looking very pretty.

1570
01:55:25,334 --> 01:55:26,902
All the best.

1571
01:55:27,213 --> 01:55:29,929
Are you all ready?
We don't have any more time.

1572
01:55:30,121 --> 01:55:31,862
Let's go.

1573
01:55:32,524 --> 01:55:36,632
Piu, the play opens with you.
Get ready soon and join us.

1574
01:55:51,092 --> 01:55:53,295
'My life is meaningless without you,
Prithviraj.'

1575
01:55:54,173 --> 01:55:56,393
'If I have to live
this life without you..'

1576
01:55:56,545 --> 01:55:59,079
'We will never meet
or talk to each other again.'

1577
01:55:59,159 --> 01:56:01,876
'My life is meaningless without you,
Prithviraj.'

1578
01:56:02,032 --> 01:56:03,907
'If I have to live
this life without you..'

1579
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:05,969
'We'll never meet
or talk to each other again...'

1580
01:56:06,049 --> 01:56:08,984
'...then I would rather
prefer death.'

1581
01:56:09,064 --> 01:56:10,876
Dad, stop the car. Please.

1582
01:56:16,257 --> 01:56:18,119
What happened?
- Dad, turn around the car.

1583
01:56:18,533 --> 01:56:20,051
Let's go back to Markoni, please.

1584
01:56:20,325 --> 01:56:21,497
Why?

1585
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:25,430
I have left behind.
- What?

1586
01:56:28,916 --> 01:56:30,132
Myself.

1587
01:56:31,294 --> 01:56:32,632
I have left behind
myself over there.

1588
01:56:32,712 --> 01:56:34,389
Let's back please.
- I can understand.

1589
01:56:35,024 --> 01:56:36,119
Let's go.

1590
01:56:42,470 --> 01:56:45,078
I have never claimed your love.

1591
01:56:46,970 --> 01:56:49,268
It's not my nature to get
anything by claiming it.

1592
01:56:50,726 --> 01:56:53,335
I have just loved you with
all my heart and mind.

1593
01:56:53,902 --> 01:56:55,538
I am your Sanyukta.

1594
01:56:56,214 --> 01:56:57,538
I belong to no one else.

1595
01:57:06,526 --> 01:57:08,323
Are we never going to meet again?

1596
01:57:09,917 --> 01:57:11,768
Will I never get to see your face?

1597
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:16,647
Please, Dad, drive fast.

1598
01:57:18,349 --> 01:57:19,457
O Lord Krishna..

1599
01:57:19,993 --> 01:57:21,795
..is this called eternal separation?

1600
01:57:21,875 --> 01:57:23,623
I can sense something really
bad is going to happen.

1601
01:57:24,309 --> 01:57:25,742
I don't know why
I have this feeling.

1602
01:57:25,822 --> 01:57:28,856
Oh Angshuman!
You are the saviour.

1603
01:57:29,181 --> 01:57:30,468
You are the epitome
of eternal youth.

1604
01:57:32,227 --> 01:57:34,214
Is it time for me to bid farewell?

1605
01:57:36,349 --> 01:57:37,822
Please drive faster!

1606
01:57:37,989 --> 01:57:40,443
My life is meaningless without you,
Prithviraj.

1607
01:57:41,344 --> 01:57:43,389
If I have to live
this life without you..

1608
01:57:44,375 --> 01:57:46,132
..then I would rather
prefer death.

1609
01:57:51,577 --> 01:57:53,280
I will give up my life.

1610
01:58:15,266 --> 01:58:16,469
Piu!

1611
01:59:22,578 --> 01:59:25,173
Piu! Piu!

1612
01:59:25,443 --> 01:59:27,362
Piu, please don't do this to me.

1613
01:59:27,562 --> 01:59:30,025
Please!
Piu, you can't do this to me.

1614
01:59:30,321 --> 01:59:32,700
What were you doing?

1615
01:59:32,780 --> 01:59:34,565
I admit my mistake, Piu, please!

1616
01:59:34,645 --> 01:59:36,659
Piu, you can't do this to me.
You can't leave me like this.

1617
01:59:36,739 --> 01:59:39,551
Please, Piu. I didn't have
that emotion within me earlier.

1618
01:59:39,861 --> 01:59:42,293
But now I know what mistake
I was going to commit. Please, Piu!

1619
01:59:42,373 --> 01:59:44,915
Piu, please! Piu!

1620
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:48,063
I am admitting my mistake.

1621
01:59:49,628 --> 01:59:51,130
Please don't leave me.

1622
01:59:51,766 --> 01:59:53,509
Piu, I love you!

1623
02:00:22,413 --> 02:00:25,561
You... are you telling the truth?

1624
02:00:26,817 --> 02:00:29,548
"My shameless heart.."

1625
02:00:29,940 --> 02:00:32,643
"..doesn't know how to
hide it's feelings."

1626
02:00:32,926 --> 02:00:38,358
"And the disobedient Moon
smiles at me being amused."

1627
02:00:39,058 --> 02:00:45,223
"My unruly heart
doesn't want to believe.."

1628
02:00:45,303 --> 02:00:51,899
"..the comfort of your
lap beside my head."

1629
02:00:56,345 --> 02:01:00,291
Thank God,
finally your life is set.

1630
02:01:32,818 --> 02:01:34,777
I ruined your play, didn't I?

1631
02:01:36,088 --> 02:01:37,169
Sorry!

1632
02:01:37,859 --> 02:01:39,094
Actually after reading
your letter I felt that..

1633
02:01:39,174 --> 02:01:41,083
..something bad
is going to happen.

1634
02:01:41,804 --> 02:01:43,777
Piu, why are you crying?
Everything is fine now.

1635
02:01:44,479 --> 02:01:46,493
I would have died
if you wouldn't come.

1636
02:01:46,573 --> 02:01:48,601
If you were a little late...
- Piu!

1637
02:01:49,567 --> 02:01:52,802
I was just not being
able to live without you.

1638
02:01:53,096 --> 02:01:54,372
I was feeling terrible pain within.

1639
02:01:55,206 --> 02:01:58,020
I didn't know what to do. So...
- So?

1640
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:02,142
Did that bottle really contain...

1641
02:02:05,015 --> 02:02:11,115
"And the disobedient Moon
smiles at me being amused.'

1642
02:02:11,345 --> 02:02:17,441
"My unruly heart
doesn't want to believe.."

1643
02:02:17,521 --> 02:02:23,698
"..the comfort of your lap
beside my head."
