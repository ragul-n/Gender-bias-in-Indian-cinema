1
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:06,166
Come on, Joginder.

2
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,500
Today's winner is Joginder.

3
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,583
Is there any man present here, who can beat my hero?

4
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:21,583
Vijay! Vijay! Vijay! Vijay! Vijay! Vijay! Vijay!

5
00:02:44,208 --> 00:03:00,375
Vijay! Vijay! Vijay! Vijay! Vijay! Vijay! Vijay!

6
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,541
Take this, I bet on Vijay. - Take this. - Take this.

7
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:07,541
Vijay! Vijay! Vijay! Vijay! Vijay! Vijay! Vijay!

8
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,750
Vijay! Vijay! Vijay! Vijay!

9
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:38,416
Vijay! Vijay! Vijay! Vijay!

10
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:16,625
Vijay! Vijay! Vijay! Vijay! Vijay! Vijay! Vijay! Vijay! Vijay! Vijay! Vijay! Vijay!

11
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:20,625
Yeah, Vijay!

12
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,291
Come on Vijay! Go Vijay!

13
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:31,291
Go Vijay!

14
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,958
Yeah, Vijay! My dear friend! My champion!

15
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,166
My champion!

16
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:48,083
Wow, buddy! What a punch it was!

17
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:51,083
Wow! Champion! - Hey, stop calling me champion..

18
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,958
Tell me how your show was. - How was the show?

19
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,125
Why didn't you come? - Oh buddy, they organized this..

20
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,458
..fight today itself, otherwise how could I miss your show?

21
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,166
Your show must've been a great success, right?

22
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:01,458
People must've given a great applause.

23
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,583
Yes, dude, people applauded very much, but not so much..

24
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,333
..that people are applauding on your success.

25
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:11,333
How wonderful it is! Yeah! Champion! - Yeah!

26
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:35,416
No!

27
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:39,416
No, no, Mr. Rana! No!

28
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:48,416
Why should I kill the one who is already dead?

29
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,041
Don't spare him brother, kill him!

30
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,125
Because of this scoundrel we've incurred..

31
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,458
..such a big loss in the fight.

32
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,208
No, Mr. Rana. Mr. Rana, please forgive me just once.

33
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:06,541
Not once, I'll forgive you twice. You are a family man.

34
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,666
The second time, I'll forgive you for them.

35
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:13,416
But the third time I won't shoot in air..

36
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,625
..but shoot right into your skull.

37
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:21,291
Uncle! Uncle! That scoundrel ruined my dignity today.

38
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,125
Nephew, who ruined your dignity today?

39
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,958
That singer Ravi Kumar. He snatched all the fans from me.

40
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,500
My shows which used to be house-full till today..

41
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,583
..are going empty today..

42
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,500
..and you won't get even one ticket of his show.

43
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,041
I feel like committing suicide.

44
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,541
No, nephew. Not you..

45
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:40,125
..but the one who will die is that scoundrel Ravi Kumar. - No!

46
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,500
You and Mac go and vacate the place of Azgar.

47
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,791
Okay, brother. - Uncle.

48
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:49,166
Nephew, you don't worry at all. - Yes.

49
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:53,166
I'll handle this Ravi Kumar.

50
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,500
Cut this scoundrel into pieces!

51
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:34,125
Uncle! Run! Police!

52
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,458
Leave me! Leave me! Leave me!

53
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,625
Vijay, you act like a mad man in anger. Try to control your anger.

54
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,416
It is a common scene in this world.

55
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,375
God gives him wealth and a human feels jealous.

56
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,833
Why you want to jump into this unnecessarily?

57
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,500
Look, Ravi, it is very simple. The one who is against.

58
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,041
..you in your profession is my enemy.

59
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,375
Is it so? Then I will leave this profession.

60
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,916
O dear, don't talk like this. Please be a good boy.

61
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:34,125
Then promise me, you are not going to hit anybody.

62
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,041
Why do you both always fight? I've been tolerating your..

63
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,750
..nonsense from a long time. - Look, mother, Ravi is telling..

64
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,666
..me to eat 10 chills at a time. - What? - What?

65
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:41,833
Mother, now you tell me..

66
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,125
..can anybody eat ten chilies at a time? Why?

67
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,166
Nobody can eat, right? So, I said look as you are my best..

68
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,291
..friend you eat five chilies and I will eat five chilies.

69
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:57,416
Am I right, mother? - I don't understand what you both say.

70
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,750
Vijay, mother got bugged off you today.

71
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,166
Now even I am bugged off you, nobody can win over you.

72
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:04,625
Ravi! Ravi! There is something in your mouth!

73
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:08,625
Open your mouth! Open your mouth! Open your mouth!

74
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:16,291
Hey, what are you doing? Why did you sit?

75
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,458
Hey, you got tired taking only one round?

76
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,291
You should at least make four rounds.

77
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,750
Look at your tummy. Look at your tummy, it has bulged out.

78
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,375
Has my stomach bulged out? Then what is this?

79
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:31,500
It is my stomach. - Do you think it has gone inside? Sit!

80
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,125
Hey, I think you have forgotten the reason for us to come here.

81
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:39,625
We don't come here to Jog. - Oh. - Yes.

82
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:43,166
I think your desires died after your wife's death. - No, no.

83
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,791
Look at my desires, they are very young.

84
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,541
It is over 10 years since my wife died.

85
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,333
My daughter is young, I am young, people think that..

86
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:50,375
..I am bachelor till now.

87
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,000
People think the same about me too.

88
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,375
Only blind people think so.

89
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,833
Hey, I don't allow my son Monty to come into my room.

90
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,958
Why? Have you hidden your maid inside your room?

91
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,875
That tells a great deal about your taste.

92
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,125
Ok, you tell me, what your taste is.

93
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:09,458
I have hidden a photograph of a very beautiful girl.

94
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,916
Now if he sees that photograph, what will he..

95
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,250
..think about his father!

96
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,416
He will think that he is the son of such a cheap father.

97
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:20,083
Hey, after all I am your friend. - That's a matter of great shame.

98
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,000
What?- For you. - What? - Yes.

99
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,041
Hey, Ghanu, will you do me a favor?

100
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,333
Not one I will do hundred favors to you. - What?

101
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:31,000
Just tell me. - I am in love with Kala, but the thing is..

102
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,875
..I am not able to approach her.

103
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,250
Will you approach her from my side?

104
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,958
Who is that unfortunate woman? - What?

105
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,750
No, I mean to say was.. Who is that fortunate unfortunate woman?

106
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,750
You first tell me. - Here.

107
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,250
Hey what are you doing? It is me.

108
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,666
You will tear my jaw now. - Oh, it is you! Yuck!

109
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,958
What were you doing? - No, actually I was..

110
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,333
..thinking about you only. - Is it?

111
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,583
I was thinking that, by showing me this photograph..

112
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,541
'..you made a big mistake.' I'll talk to this girl..

113
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:23,416
'..not for you, but for me.' - You mumbled something in.

114
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:24,958
..between, I couldn't hear it. - I was talking to myself..

115
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,083
..because if you had heard them, your heart..

116
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:30,083
..would've broken into pieces.

117
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:35,541
She is here.

118
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:48,875
I am sorry. - Don't feel sorry, make it a habit for everyday.

119
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,000
My work.. - My work is done. - What?

120
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,833
No, I meant.. Your work is done. Congratulations!

121
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:06,375
Shame on you! - I feel something is fishy.

122
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,458
No, no, my friend can never do this.

123
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:13,333
Hey, uncle! How are you, uncle?

124
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,666
What happened to you, dear? - Hey Ravi! Scoundrel!

125
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,958
Hey! Get up from there! - Hey! Hey!

126
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,666
Hey, scoundrel, I got a big twist and turn in my life..

127
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,125
..and you are sitting here and playing the guitar?

128
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,500
Hey, what happened, dude? - Hey, dear, I was pleading to..

129
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,208
..God for a beautiful girl in India, but I got a girl from..

130
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:33,500
..London, buddy! - Oh, I see, nowadays your..

131
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
..dreams are also imported.

132
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,916
Hey, buddy, why are you making fun of me?

133
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,500
I swear on you. This is true. - Really?

134
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,541
Actually it started this way..

135
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:48,041
I was happily driving my car, suddenly a car overtook mine.

136
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:51,083
Hey, hey! She showed me thumb. She challenged me.

137
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,916
You, I am not going to leave you.

138
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,250
She challenged me, she challenged Vijay Kumar.

139
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,500
What happened then? - Then my vehicle said.. Hey brother..

140
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,458
..what is going on here! Step on your gas and..

141
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,916
..show your charm. I said fine! I changed the gear and..

142
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:13,208
..I stepped on the gas. Hey, what happened?

143
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,458
Hey, you are not stepping on the gas, but my leg. My leg!

144
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,333
Remove your leg from mine! - Oh sorry, sorry.

145
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:21,458
Then there was a race between us.

146
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,000
Sometimes right, sometimes left.

147
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,958
How dare she, she didn't let me go in the front at all.

148
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:33,500
I turned my vehicle and put a reverse gear.

149
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,500
Her vehicle was coming straight and mine was in reverse.

150
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,291
Then I stopped my vehicle in front of hers.

151
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:49,875
You stopped your vehicle? Thank God! Then?

152
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:54,125
I could see beautiful legs out of the car.

153
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,166
Then a beautiful girl came out of the car.

154
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,166
O my God! She was turmoil.

155
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:04,208
With style stealthily she came to me! - Then?

156
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:05,375
She said..

157
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,750
For the first time in my life a thunder like you has messed..

158
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:14,708
..up with a volcano like me. You don't drive your car, but fly it.

159
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:18,000
In London, people are crazy about my driving.

160
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,291
In India I have become a fan of your driving.

161
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:29,500
If you were in London your name would've..

162
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,750
..entered the Guinness book of world records.

163
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,875
Then, what happened? - Then, she came close to me.

164
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,666
She came closer. - Th.. The.. Then?

165
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:39,916
She came very close to me. - Then?

166
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,125
She kissed me. - Oh I see, that means, in turn even..

167
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,833
.. you would've kissed her. - Yes, yes, yes. I kissed her.

168
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:49,666
So, you kissed her? Oh, I see. - Yes.

169
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,833
You tell me one thing. - Yes, ask.

170
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:58,916
Where did she kiss you? - Oh, here. - Here, I see.

171
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:02,916
You scoundrel, why did you slap me so hard?

172
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,708
To impress a girl you drive the car so fast?

173
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,458
You've just learnt to drive. What if you had..

174
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,208
..met with an accident?

175
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:11,500
Hey, Ravi! - What?

176
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,083
Something is burning. - Where? What are you saying?

177
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:14,125
Yes, yes. - Where? Where?

178
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,208
Hey, look, your heart is burning. Look, your heart is burning.

179
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,666
Hey you! Wait! I won't leave you.

180
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:19,583
Hey you! Wait! Wait!

181
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:24,250
Stop the car. Stop the car. Please stop the car.

182
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,666
Sir, please stop the car. Please stop the car, sir.

183
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:32,666
I want lift. Lift.

184
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:48,041
What nonsense is this?

185
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:51,500
It is not nonsense, mister!

186
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,500
This is a new way of asking for a lift.

187
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,125
Since half an hour, my driver..

188
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,041
..was trying to ask lift from people.

189
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:15,791
Instead of stopping, people were showing their thumbs to him.

190
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:19,500
'O my God! What a face, what a style, what a beauty..'

191
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,583
'After seeing this, anybody would've felt..'

192
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:25,583
'..lucky in giving you a lift.'

193
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,750
By the way, I feel I have seen you somewhere.

194
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,250
I think I have seen you somewhere.

195
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,083
Hey, I think you didn't recognize me.

196
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:41,333
My name is Ravi Kumar, singer.

197
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:45,333
Oh, I see. So, you are Mr. Ravi Kumar? - Yes.

198
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,791
You sing well. - Thanks for the compliment.

199
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,833
Now, you will start complimenting me. - What?

200
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,375
Then you would like me to praise you.

201
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,000
If we both start praising each other, then I will..

202
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,000
..leave my house behind. This is my house.

203
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:11,000
Oh, so you stay here? - Yes, do you have any objection?

204
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,041
You take the money for your broken glass and go from here.

205
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,583
Hey, you don't need to pay me money!

206
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,500
That was a beautiful style of yours.

207
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,750
And I don't take money from beautiful girls.

208
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:31,083
I liked you comment, but I know that you are trying to..

209
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,750
..flirt with me. - What?

210
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,208
Thank you for the lift. Good night.

211
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:41,208
"I am a Jat, mad, and crazy.."

212
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,500
Why are you so late? You've drove my sleep away.

213
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,250
I drove your sleep? But you were dancing now.

214
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,000
You were singing crazy songs. - No, actually I was feeling..

215
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,333
..very sleepy, so to drive away the sleep I was singing..

216
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,375
..crazy songs to drive away the sleep. Why are you so late?

217
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:07,041
Father, you know what happened today.

218
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,041
On the way my vehicle broke down.

219
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,625
You know who dropped me here. - Who?

220
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,541
You dream star, Mr. Ravi Kumar. - You must be kidding me, dear.

221
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,208
I swear on you. - What are you talking? - Yes.

222
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:20,666
Hey, you could've brought him inside the house.

223
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,000
I would've met and I would've felt proud.

224
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,500
You are too much, dear. - I didn't encourage him at all.

225
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,833
I didn't even let him know that I know him and I am a very..

226
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:34,000
..big fan of his. But I have done something of the sort..

227
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,166
..that he will revolve around our house.

228
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:38,750
He will just revolve around our house.

229
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,750
Bye, good night.

230
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:06,916
Ravi, I am always restless to meet you and to be with you.

231
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:12,750
But when I met you today I didn't even talk to you properly.

232
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,208
Sorry! What else could have I done?

233
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,458
By letting you know that I love you, I didn't want to become..

234
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:22,083
..cheap like those girls who love you only for your..

235
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:27,750
..wealth and fame. Just wait and watch, this attitude..

236
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,750
..of mine will force you to fall in love with me some day.

237
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:52,541
"The lovers are meeting today."

238
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:58,916
"The clouds are overcast and flowers are blooming."

239
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:05,333
"The heart is very peaceful."

240
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:09,333
"It has found its destination."

241
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:30,583
"My life is singing."

242
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:37,083
"Now that I have become your companion."

243
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:43,416
"The heart is very peaceful."

244
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:47,416
"It has found its destination."

245
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:40,500
"Where have we come walking? Where?"

246
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,916
"There's aroma everywhere. Everywhere."

247
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:53,208
"The soft breeze is like flowing stream of music."

248
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:59,583
"All the sights are beautiful, but you are the most beautiful."

249
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:05,958
"We both are lost in love."

250
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:12,375
"Like lost butterfly in a garden."

251
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:18,750
"The heart is very peaceful."

252
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,750
"It has found its destination."

253
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:19,166
"The birds are chirping. Are chirping."

254
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:25,416
"They're saying listen to your heart. Listen."

255
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:31,875
"The season has come with the riot of colours."

256
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:38,166
"It seems that we both are all alone in the world."

257
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:44,375
"All our desires are fulfilled."

258
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:50,333
"We won't repent now even if we die."

259
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:57,291
"The heart is very peaceful."

260
00:23:57,791 --> 00:24:01,291
"It has found its destination."

261
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:22,666
"The lovers are meeting today."

262
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:29,125
"The clouds are overcast and flowers are blooming."

263
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:35,416
"The heart is very peaceful."

264
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:41,666
"It has found its destination."

265
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:48,125
"My life is singing."

266
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:54,541
"Now that I have become your companion."

267
00:24:55,041 --> 00:25:00,916
"The heart is very peaceful."

268
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,916
"It has found its destination."

269
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,333
I feel that I am very fortunate because I got a chance..

270
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:03,666
..to sit with you and drink this tender coconut. - Really?

271
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:07,666
I respect you a lot. More than respect, I love you very much.

272
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:15,375
Get lost, I won't talk to you.

273
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,958
But I will keep talking. I enjoy talking.

274
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:20,541
Actually when my hand touches yours I feel like..

275
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:21,875
..my hands are turning into feathers

276
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:24,083
..and I'm flying like a crow..

277
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,958
I mean I am flying like a cuckoo and you are sitting on my..

278
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:29,666
..back and I am tickling you with my feathers.

279
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:32,208
You are very naughty. Shall I make a move now?

280
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:35,625
No, no, first promise that you'll meet me once again.

281
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:38,666
I can't promise you, but I will surely meet you.

282
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:41,250
Actually, I forgot to tell you the real matter.

283
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,750
I want to introduce you to my friend. - Is it so? - Yes.

284
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,666
He had a sister who resembled you very much.

285
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:51,333
She died. - How sad! - Yes. So he wants you to tie..

286
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:54,833
..him a Rakhi. - What? Is it? He wants me to tie him a Rakhi?

287
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:58,125
Yes, so when should I get my brother-in-law to tie you Rakhi?

288
00:26:58,625 --> 00:27:00,416
Do one thing, Raksha Bandhan (Indian festival)

289
00:27:00,916 --> 00:27:02,916
..is nearing, that day will be very auspicious..

290
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:06,666
..to meet my brother. - Wow, wonderful!

291
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:10,625
Before that I.. one small one.. - No, no! Shall I make a move?

292
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:12,750
Shall I make a move? - Please, give me one..

293
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:17,791
No. - Bye. Shall I keep this?

294
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:19,541
You are giving me the garbage and leaving.

295
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:24,541
Okay, come! Come slowly, or else you'll fall.

296
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:26,458
Hey, did you do it? - Absolutely, congratulations!

297
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:27,750
Thank you. - Hold this.

298
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,208
Did you tell her.. did you tell her the matter?

299
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:30,750
Hey, I have told her everything, everything about you.

300
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,083
Now she can't deny your proposal.

301
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:33,083
Is it? When are you introducing me to her?

302
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:34,208
No, no. I can't introduce you now. .

303
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:36,916
You continue to sit there. - Hey, you make me sit there..

304
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:40,500
..daily and you sit here and God knows what all you do.

305
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Hey, I do that for your sake. - Is it so?

306
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,333
Think that you are doing it and I am sitting there.

307
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:45,666
Okay, okay! - Why don't you understand, buddy?

308
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:47,958
Actually the thing is that that auspicious day is coming..

309
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,250
..very soon when I will introduce you to her.

310
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,791
Actually she is a girl like iron. - Okay!

311
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:54,791
First I have to melt the iron. Then melt iron to water.

312
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:57,583
Then make the water as wax. Then I have to vanish the wax.

313
00:27:58,083 --> 00:27:59,208
What are you doing? You stand straight. - Yes, yes!

314
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:01,208
What I am telling is, give me some time.

315
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:04,125
I have to trap her. I have to make her mine.

316
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:06,041
I have to embrace her. I will hold her so tight that you will..

317
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:11,666
..be stunned to see. Okay, I'll make a move now.

318
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:13,833
Yes, sir, who do you want to meet? - Please call madam.

319
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:19,500
Who is it, Ramdeen? You?

320
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,500
Yes, it is me.

321
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:33,291
How can I help you? - They say talking with love..

322
00:28:33,791 --> 00:28:37,083
..to someone is like praying to God. What do you say?

323
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:40,750
There are many other ways of praying.

324
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,250
Anyways, tell me what is the matter?

325
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,416
Matter? There is no matter at all.

326
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:51,833
Yes, but there is a desire. - Yesterday, you forgot your..

327
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:57,333
..handkerchief in my car and -So, you came here to return that.

328
00:28:57,833 --> 00:29:00,000
I think you would have got used to all these things.

329
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,333
Why not? Who knows how many girls would've asked..

330
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:03,916
..you for a lift. Somebody would've forgotten their..

331
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:06,750
..vanity bag and somebody would've forgotten their book..

332
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:09,166
..and somebody their handkerchief.

333
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:13,916
Why don't you hire a servant to return those things to girls?

334
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:17,125
Look, I can't say about others that why do they intentionally..

335
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:20,208
..leave their handkerchief in others' vehicles, but..

336
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:23,041
..this is a first time such an incident happened in my car..

337
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:29,916
..and has become an unforgettable incident in my life.

338
00:29:30,416 --> 00:29:35,625
Incident? - Yes. A beautiful and charming incident.

339
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:38,291
You talk very well. - I am thankful that you like..

340
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:42,500
..at least something in me. I haven't come here to give..

341
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,291
..your handkerchief back to you, instead I will keep this..

342
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:54,416
..handkerchief with me for the lifetime. - Why?

343
00:29:54,916 --> 00:30:01,833
Because I love you. Because of this handkerchief I feel..

344
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:05,833
..as though your fragrance is settled in my breath.

345
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:10,541
Tomorrow there's my show is in Wahedas Hall.

346
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:13,666
If you attend that I will feel that you did a favor on me

347
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:17,666
I can't come. - In spite of that I'll wait for you.

348
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:35,750
Meena, why did he come here. Who allowed him inside this house?

349
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,833
Why? What is wrong with him?

350
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:40,416
He is a cheater, thief, and fraud.

351
00:30:40,916 --> 00:30:43,250
He always tries to flirt around with girls with his art.

352
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,750
Wherever he sees any beautiful girl standing in..

353
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,250
..the corner of the road asking for lift, he forcibly stops..

354
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,583
..his vehicle there and he misbehaves..

355
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:52,208
..with those innocent girls.

356
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:55,541
Monty, I too have experienced if it is the girl who is..

357
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:59,541
..forcing him to give lift or Ravi forces a girl to take lift.

358
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:09,958
Enough, dude, how long will you take?

359
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:14,666
Will you count everything here only?

360
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:16,833
Now ring the bell. - Okay

361
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,458
Hey, you've actually turned on the light. Bell, bell.

362
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:21,500
Sorry, dude, I haven't worked as a watchman till now.

363
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,333
Enough, how many times will you ring the bell?

364
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:28,833
She is here. - Oh, hi, Ghanshyam.

365
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:31,458
He is the poor man whose sister looked like you.

366
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:33,625
Oh, how sweet! - Okay, okay.

367
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,291
How are you? - Okay, okay, okay, I am fine.

368
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:40,291
Come, come, please come inside, please. - Okay!

369
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:44,500
Hey, you come inside. - You yourself left me outside.

370
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,791
You are a crazy fellow.

371
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:48,791
You know, after knowing about you..

372
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:52,791
..I told Mr. Ghanshyam that there would be no auspicious..

373
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:57,666
..day than today. By the way, nowadays who accepts anybody?

374
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,083
Believe me just because of your love, our relationship..

375
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:02,000
..has strengthened more.

376
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,666
So, shall I believe that our relationship is..

377
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:06,500
Fi.. Fi.. Fi.. Fi.. - Fixed! - Fixed.

378
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,375
There is nothing left now. I have already spoken to her..

379
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:10,041
..about the relationship. She has agreed it. - Is it?

380
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:12,250
You only have to distribute sweets now. - Is it?

381
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,583
Why not? I have kept everything ready.

382
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:17,916
I'll just be back in two minutes.

383
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:23,208
Oh thank you, dear! - Hey, what are you doing?

384
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:27,208
You are so happy that you are kissing me.

385
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,458
No! - Hey, why are you so silent?

386
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:34,041
He is so happy that he has become quiet, lost his..

387
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:35,750
..consciousness, he has got intoxicated.

388
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,500
Finally I would say, he has become a rabbit.

389
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,166
Now see, what is going to come. Close your eyes.

390
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:47,333
Close your eyes. Ready, now see.

391
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:51,250
No. - Hey what are you doing? - Give me your hand.

392
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,500
Give her your hand. Give her your hand. Tie it.

393
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,041
Make it fast. Tie it fast. Fast. See this. This, this..

394
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:01,833
This is your gift. - No. - Give it to her from your right hand.

395
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:05,375
Very good, give this to her from your hand. Good.

396
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:07,541
From today onwards.. - How sweet!

397
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:09,333
Never think that your sister is not alive.

398
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:13,333
She is right in front of you. Here she is.

399
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:24,833
I'll kill you. I'll kill you. - Brother, open your mouth.

400
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:26,791
Brother, open your mouth. - Open your mouth.

401
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:31,250
What are you pressing? Congratulations! From today..

402
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:37,500
..onwards our friendship has changed into relationship.

403
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I am getting married to her so you are my brother-in-law now.

404
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,083
Wow, wonderful show! - He is a good singer.

405
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:50,583
Manger, he is a big fan of Ravi. - Oh, is it?

406
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:52,625
He is going to America by tonight's flight.

407
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:54,291
He is insisting that he will leave only after watching..

408
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:55,791
..Ravi's show. - Okay.

409
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:57,916
Manager, please make some arrangements for him or..

410
00:33:58,416 --> 00:33:59,416
..I will have to give him my ticket.

411
00:33:59,916 --> 00:34:00,583
Hey, I swear on the full house..

412
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:02,541
Why do you have to worry about it? I'll do something for him.

413
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:07,333
Please come. - Thank you. - Come, come in.

414
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:08,916
Hi! - Hi!

415
00:34:09,416 --> 00:34:11,958
Did you recognize me? - It is not only difficult to forget..

416
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:15,958
..you, but it is impossible. - I think the same about you too.

417
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:19,791
The thing that I am feeling; are you feeling the same?

418
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:21,458
First let me know about your feelings,

419
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:23,375
..then let's talk further.

420
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:28,250
I just wanted to tell you that it looks as if we know each..

421
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:32,250
..other from a very long time. - Why are you feeling so?

422
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:37,166
Actually, the style that you met me for the first time.

423
00:34:37,666 --> 00:34:41,291
It seems as though we know each other from ages.

424
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:45,291
If this is the case, we would've met ages before.

425
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,833
Congratulations! Congratulations!

426
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:55,458
Not this.. He got a seat. - If he would've come at a moment..

427
00:34:55,958 --> 00:35:00,000
..like this in London, he would be trashed so badly, so badly..

428
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,750
That his name would be registered in Guinness book..

429
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,541
..of world record. - That's right.

430
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:08,666
By the way, madam, are you here to see the show?

431
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:11,541
No, I was searching you since morning to give you a kiss..

432
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:16,708
Finally I found you here. Sir, I am a big fan of this singer.

433
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:20,708
Look, I have booked the tickets in advance.

434
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,000
"I just want to keep looking at you for a hundred years."

435
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,833
"I just want to keep looking at you for a hundred years."

436
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:29,458
"After hundred years,..

437
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:33,166
I keep wondering for another hundred years."

438
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:36,708
"Then for hundred I'd like to..

439
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:40,083
..say in every language of the world.."

440
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:44,083
"For centuries I've been loving you."

441
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:05,916
"I just want to keep looking at you for a hundred years."

442
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:34,875
"The passing time should also turn back and see."

443
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:38,875
"How somebody has immersed in love."

444
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:56,500
"The passing time should also turn back and see."

445
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,833
"How somebody has immersed in love."

446
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:11,000
"The stars say that on earth.."

447
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:18,333
"..somebody is mad after someone."

448
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:28,416
"Somebody is mad after someone."

449
00:38:28,916 --> 00:38:35,625
"For hundred years I'd keep loving you silently."

450
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:43,041
"For hundred years I'd keep yearning for you."

451
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:50,208
"Then for hundred I'd like to say in every language of the world.."

452
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:54,208
"For centuries I've been loving you."

453
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:15,875
"I just want to keep looking at you for a hundred years."

454
00:39:41,791 --> 00:39:48,583
"The wind is listening and also the atmosphere."

455
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:52,583
"My calls are echoing in the mountains."

456
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:09,458
"The wind is listening and also the atmosphere."

457
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:16,625
"My calls are echoing in the mountains."

458
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:23,916
"Even if I am dead I'll be yours."

459
00:40:24,416 --> 00:40:31,125
"My love and sincerity are immortal."

460
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:41,375
"My love and sincerity are immortal."

461
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:48,666
"For hundred years I'd roam as a monk."

462
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:56,083
"For hundred years I'd take only one name."

463
00:40:56,583 --> 00:41:02,958
"Then for hundred I'd like to say in every language of the world.."

464
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:06,958
"For centuries I've been loving you."

465
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:36,583
"I just want to keep looking at you for a hundred years."

466
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:41,291
Wasn't that great? - Sir, Mr. Ravi Kumar has called you.

467
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:46,791
Okay, yes! See you.

468
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:49,916
Wow, he sang wonderfully! - He is a good singer.

469
00:41:50,416 --> 00:41:53,833
Meena! One minute, hold on, hold on.

470
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:56,291
Autograph please. Autograph please.

471
00:41:56,791 --> 00:41:57,958
Autograph please. - Autograph please.

472
00:41:58,458 --> 00:42:01,583
One minute, Meena!- I'll give it to you. Wait, wait.

473
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:04,333
Don't worry, Mr. Gupta. Your show will surely take place

474
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:07,541
Thank you very much, sir. - Okay.

475
00:42:08,041 --> 00:42:13,166
Hello, handsome, will you meet me in Golden Club tomorrow?

476
00:42:13,666 --> 00:42:17,833
I am sorry, Meenu, I can't come tomorrow. I am busy.

477
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:20,666
I'll see how busy or free you are tomorrow.

478
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:24,458
Tomorrow I'll wait for you in Golden Club.

479
00:42:24,958 --> 00:42:28,416
Look, Meenu, don't wait for me. I can't come.

480
00:42:28,916 --> 00:42:31,208
Ravi, it's neither your fault nor hers.

481
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:36,583
It is your fate. In my first meeting, the girl kisses me.

482
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:40,416
And in your first meeting the glass is broken.

483
00:42:40,916 --> 00:42:43,500
You called your girlfriend on the show, she came, but..

484
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,083
..she didn't meet you. I didn't call my girlfriend to the show..

485
00:42:47,583 --> 00:42:50,166
..but then too she came and sat next to me till the end.

486
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:54,000
What are you saying! Hey, even my girlfriend was sitting..

487
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,708
..in your row. - Is it so? Which color dress was she wearing?

488
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,375
She was wearing a yellow dress.

489
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:02,500
But your sister-in-law too was wearing yellow.

490
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,333
Was she sitting on my right or left?

491
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:07,958
I was there to sing a song and not to see on your right and left.

492
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:10,791
Okay, forget it. Would you like to hear some wonderful news?

493
00:43:11,291 --> 00:43:14,958
Tell me. - She has called me at Golden Club tomorrow..

494
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:17,541
..evening at sharp 4 O' Clock. What are you saying, buddy?

495
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:20,333
Do you want to hear one more wonderful news? - Tell me.

496
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:22,291
But I am not going there. - Why?

497
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:24,500
I am champion, champion.

498
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,625
I will not get knocked out in the first shot of love.

499
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:30,541
Come on, buddy. - Look, buddy, you have to be hard to get.

500
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:33,416
Tell me what you say. - Look, buddy, at least once..

501
00:43:33,916 --> 00:43:35,541
..you introduce me to my sister-in-law.

502
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:38,291
After that you play hard to get, get trashed by..

503
00:43:38,791 --> 00:43:41,458
..shoes or sandals. I will not disturb you both.

504
00:43:41,958 --> 00:43:43,291
You just reach the club by 4 O' Clock.

505
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:47,291
After that I'll come there. Okay?

506
00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:10,041
Can I sit here in front of you? - Why not?

507
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:12,416
But only for a short while because I am waiting for..

508
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:16,416
..someone else. - Is that so?

509
00:44:22,583 --> 00:44:26,000
Who is that fortunate man? - Actually I am very fortunate..

510
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:30,375
..as I got a chance to sit with him.

511
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:34,916
I wish I was there in his place. - I didn't understand.

512
00:44:35,416 --> 00:44:37,500
I don't think you are so immature.

513
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,625
You break the glass of somebody's car, but still..

514
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:42,875
..he drops you at your doorstep.

515
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:44,791
The next day he comes to your house with an excuse..

516
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:48,791
..of the handkerchief just to get a glance of yours.

517
00:44:52,458 --> 00:44:56,750
Isn't this enough to understand a person's feelings?

518
00:44:57,250 --> 00:45:00,291
So many girls are your friends, your fans, they understand..

519
00:45:00,791 --> 00:45:04,166
..your feeling, still you are not content.

520
00:45:04,666 --> 00:45:07,083
Since I have seen you, I am very restless and a feeling..

521
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:09,958
..of loneliness has surrounded me.

522
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:14,791
How many girls did you say the same thing?

523
00:45:15,291 --> 00:45:18,791
If you think whatever I am telling you is lie..

524
00:45:19,291 --> 00:45:20,916
..or that I am just spinning yarns, then I would like to leave..

525
00:45:21,416 --> 00:45:23,083
Enough, enough! I was just testing you.

526
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:27,541
I just wanted to see if you too feel the same way..

527
00:45:28,041 --> 00:45:31,500
..that I feel for you.

528
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,708
Then what did your heart say?

529
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:38,833
My heart said that it didn't make a mistake..

530
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:43,833
..by falling in love with you.

531
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:45,666
I'll come tomorrow by 5 O' Clock and we will meet then.

532
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:48,541
Oh sorry! - Sorry, madam. Sorry.

533
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:51,333
Look what have you done! Get lost from here.

534
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:53,750
Your dress is spoilt. Come, I'll drop you home.

535
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:59,916
No, it is okay. I'll go. My car is fine today.

536
00:46:00,416 --> 00:46:02,500
Okay, fine, let me at least see you off till the vehicle.

537
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,500
Okay! - Please come.

538
00:46:18,458 --> 00:46:21,958
Do one thing, get two sandwiches.

539
00:46:51,125 --> 00:46:56,500
So you are here? I knew that you would surely come.

540
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,541
I didn't come here to meet you.

541
00:46:59,041 --> 00:47:02,333
I came here looking for my friend.

542
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:05,291
That's it. This is the problem in you guys.

543
00:47:05,791 --> 00:47:10,708
Just to impress girls, they try to show attitude. Ego.

544
00:47:11,208 --> 00:47:14,291
Hey, madam, we don't have attitude.

545
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:20,250
We borrow it from beautiful girls like you.

546
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,583
Thank you. - Welcome!

547
00:47:23,083 --> 00:47:25,708
By the way, I came here to meet you, but some time.

548
00:47:26,208 --> 00:47:32,375
..back I changed my decision. - What decision?

549
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:35,166
Finding me alone here many young, handsome and..

550
00:47:35,666 --> 00:47:37,250
.. dashing guys approached me.

551
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:42,958
Somebody gave me flowers and somebody invited me for dinner.

552
00:47:43,458 --> 00:47:45,875
One guy was even chasing me to marry him.

553
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:48,125
Yes, you should've accepted his proposal.

554
00:47:48,625 --> 00:47:49,375
You could've married him.

555
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:54,291
Why you had to make me wait here for one hour?

556
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:56,958
Caught you! That is the reason I say don't try to act smart.

557
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:00,083
Okay, fine. Then sit here for some more time.

558
00:48:00,583 --> 00:48:02,250
Some other young man will come and you get married..

559
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:04,958
..to him only. I am going. - Hey, Vijay, I was just joking.

560
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:08,958
Why are you getting angry?

561
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:30,833
"Why are you angry with me?"

562
00:48:31,333 --> 00:48:33,208
"What has upset you?"

563
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:37,208
"Ok. You are right and I'm wrong."

564
00:48:42,541 --> 00:48:44,250
"Why are you angry with me?"

565
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:46,500
"What has upset you?"

566
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,500
"Ok. You are right and I'm wrong."

567
00:49:18,416 --> 00:49:22,333
"Until when will you hide your love for me?"

568
00:49:22,833 --> 00:49:26,333
"The anger is just an act. In fact you love me."

569
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:35,625
"Until when will you hide your love for me?"

570
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:40,250
"The anger is just an act. In fact you love me."

571
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:44,666
"This wall of lies, who knows when it'll fall."

572
00:49:45,166 --> 00:49:49,166
"This wall of lies, who knows when it'll fall."

573
00:49:49,666 --> 00:49:53,166
"Ok. You are right and I'm wrong."

574
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,291
"Why are you angry with me?"

575
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:02,583
"What has upset you?"

576
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:06,583
"Ok. You are right and I'm wrong."

577
00:50:25,416 --> 00:50:27,125
"You are so ignorant."

578
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:29,375
"At least understand this, dear."

579
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:33,375
"If I've met you smiling, do not take it as love."

580
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,583
"You are so ignorant."

581
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:42,791
"At least understand this, dear."

582
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:47,208
"If I've met you smiling, do not take it as love."

583
00:50:47,708 --> 00:50:51,666
"Make your heart understand not to be unnecessarily happy."

584
00:50:52,166 --> 00:50:56,125
"Make your heart understand not to be unnecessarily happy."

585
00:50:56,625 --> 00:51:00,125
"It's the truth that I am right and you're absolutely wrong."

586
00:51:23,416 --> 00:51:27,500
"Do not break the heart of the one who loves you."

587
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,500
"Just smile and stop fighting."

588
00:51:36,833 --> 00:51:40,958
"Do not break the heart of the one who loves you."

589
00:51:41,458 --> 00:51:45,458
"Just smile and stop fighting."

590
00:51:45,958 --> 00:51:47,625
"I've fallen in love with you.."

591
00:51:48,125 --> 00:51:49,875
"..it is unfortunate for me."

592
00:51:50,375 --> 00:51:52,041
"I've fallen in love with you.."

593
00:51:52,541 --> 00:51:54,291
"..it is unfortunate for me."

594
00:51:54,791 --> 00:51:58,291
"Ok. You are right and I'm wrong."

595
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,541
"Why are you angry with me?"

596
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:07,791
"What has upset you?"

597
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:11,791
"Ok. You are right and I'm wrong."

598
00:52:21,666 --> 00:52:23,583
You want to get married to Meena, then don't worry..

599
00:52:24,083 --> 00:52:27,041
..you'll surely marry her. I'll go right away and talk to her father.

600
00:52:27,541 --> 00:52:28,875
Her father is my childhood friend.

601
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:30,666
And Meena is your childhood friend.

602
00:52:31,166 --> 00:52:35,916
I'll go right now and fix your marriage and return.

603
00:52:36,416 --> 00:52:38,041
Nephew, congratulations! You are going to become the..

604
00:52:38,541 --> 00:52:39,833
..son-in-law of a millionaire.

605
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:44,791
Nephew, after you become rich, please don't forget us.

606
00:52:45,291 --> 00:52:48,000
Uncle, what are you talking!

607
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,291
I am ashamed of what I did. - No, no!

608
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,041
Absolutely not! Absolutely not!

609
00:52:51,541 --> 00:52:55,583
Meena is like my daughter. If she wants to get married to Ravi..

610
00:52:56,083 --> 00:52:58,541
..instead of Monty, so what? We both will get her married.

611
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:00,625
I'll get Monty married to somebody.

612
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:02,458
Are you happy? Thank you very much, dear.

613
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:04,083
You've eased the burden on my heart.

614
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:05,791
No, don't talk about heart.

615
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:08,000
Okay, I won't. Look I hold my ears. Are you happy?

616
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,500
Scoundrel Ravi Kumar! Ravi Kumar! I am going to kill him!

617
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,208
I am going to kill that scoundrel! - Monty! Control yourself, Monty.

618
00:53:16,708 --> 00:53:21,000
Control yourself. - I'll kill him. - Relax.

619
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:25,000
I have to do something about this Ravi Kumar.

620
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:22,750
Mr. Ravi, who do you suspect behind this attack?

621
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:24,541
Do you have any old rivalries with anybody or..

622
00:54:25,041 --> 00:54:26,000
..dispute against property? Or do you think somebody..

623
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,041
..is jealous of you because of your profession.

624
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:32,208
Who were they? - Inspector, I don't have enmity with anyone.

625
00:54:32,708 --> 00:54:36,000
I haven't left any place for jealousy in my profession.

626
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,666
I don't know who they were. - Okay, Mr. Ravi.

627
00:54:39,166 --> 00:54:41,458
Thank you for your co operation. Take rest.

628
00:54:41,958 --> 00:54:45,208
We'll try to trace them out soon. Come, let's go.

629
00:54:45,708 --> 00:54:51,208
Look, Ravi, you can lie to the world, but not to me.

630
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:55,708
You don't know how bad I am feeling. I can't you see like this.

631
00:54:56,208 --> 00:54:58,875
Tell me the truth, who were they?

632
00:54:59,375 --> 00:55:01,625
Vijay, please believe me. I don't know them.

633
00:55:02,125 --> 00:55:05,208
Then, swear on me. - Vijay, I am telling you the truth.

634
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:07,500
As soon as they came they put something into my eyes.

635
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,875
Then they attacked me. Really I didn't see them at all.

636
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:15,791
The day I will know about those scoundrels I'll break..

637
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:19,000
.. their bones and take a revenge for

638
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,708
..every drop of your blood they shed.

639
00:55:22,208 --> 00:55:24,583
Mr. Vijay, press people and fans of Mr. Ravi have..

640
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:26,583
..gathered outside the hospital.

641
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:29,625
They want to meet Mr. Ravi right now.

642
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:31,375
I can't permit them for this. You please go and..

643
00:55:31,875 --> 00:55:35,375
..make them understand it. - Okay.

644
00:55:39,416 --> 00:55:45,583
Ravi! Ravi! What happen to you?

645
00:55:46,083 --> 00:55:49,333
How did all this happen? Who were those people who..

646
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:53,875
..thrashed you like this? - I'll tell you. Come sit. Sit.

647
00:55:54,375 --> 00:55:57,916
Thank God nothing happened to you, or else I..

648
00:55:58,416 --> 00:56:05,250
I love you, Ravi. I love you.

649
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:07,750
Thank you very much as you all are so concerned about..

650
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:10,250
..him and came to see him, but he needs total rest now.

651
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:12,541
Please leave him alone. Please.

652
00:56:13,041 --> 00:56:14,833
But excuse me, Mr. Vijay..

653
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:20,416
Ravi, I can't live without you even for a second.

654
00:56:20,916 --> 00:56:24,416
I couldn't see you in this state.

655
00:56:53,875 --> 00:56:57,416
Vijay! Why didn't you come..

656
00:56:57,916 --> 00:57:04,375
..to the hospital from past two days?

657
00:57:04,875 --> 00:57:08,666
Hey, Vijay, why are you so quiet?

658
00:57:09,166 --> 00:57:13,250
Ravi, you love Meena very much, right?

659
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:17,625
Yes, I love her, but all of a sudden, why are you bringing..

660
00:57:18,125 --> 00:57:20,708
..Meena between us? - Meena didn't come..

661
00:57:21,208 --> 00:57:25,166
..between us, Ravi. I feel that I came in between Meena and you.

662
00:57:25,666 --> 00:57:30,666
I didn't understand it. - Ravi, do you remember I said that..

663
00:57:31,166 --> 00:57:36,500
..one girl kissed me? The girl is none other than Meena..

664
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,541
..who kissed you in the hospital in front of me.

665
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:42,208
No, buddy. That is not possible.

666
00:57:42,708 --> 00:57:44,958
I think you have misunderstood something.

667
00:57:45,458 --> 00:57:52,458
Misunderstood something? Ravi, I knew that you won't believe me.

668
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:55,916
She pretended to be Meenu and played..

669
00:57:56,416 --> 00:57:59,333
..a game of love with me and she enacted as Meena and..

670
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:03,500
..made you go crazy. - If this is true, then she is cheating us.

671
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,916
You do one thing, if she meets you, then you get her to..

672
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:08,041
..Manorie beach in the evening today.

673
00:58:08,541 --> 00:58:10,458
If I meet her, then I'll get her there.

674
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:14,083
Vijay, why do we sacrifice our friendship for that girl?

675
00:58:14,583 --> 00:58:18,083
Instead we will sacrifice that girl for our friendship.

676
00:58:45,416 --> 00:58:46,750
Meenu! - Yes!

677
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:54,166
Do you know him? - Yes. He is the same singer, Ravi Kumar.

678
00:58:54,666 --> 00:58:57,541
Are you meeting him for the first time? - Yes.

679
00:58:58,041 --> 00:59:01,541
Try to recall, Meenu, you would've met him somewhere earlier.

680
00:59:02,041 --> 00:59:03,916
I am sure I am meeting him for the first time.

681
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:05,791
Before this I've watched his shows and I have heard..

682
00:59:06,291 --> 00:59:09,541
..his albums in London too.

683
00:59:10,041 --> 00:59:14,208
You are lying, Meenu. You are lying.

684
00:59:14,708 --> 00:59:16,875
On one hand you pretended to love Ravi and on the other..

685
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:19,416
..hand you are having an affair with me.

686
00:59:19,916 --> 00:59:22,541
What nonsense is this! Have you gone mad?

687
00:59:23,041 --> 00:59:25,000
I loved you, I didn't pretend to do so.

688
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:31,083
And about Mr. Ravi, neither I have met him earlier nor do I love him.

689
00:59:31,583 --> 00:59:38,000
Haven't you met me earlier? Haven't you met me earlier?

690
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,083
Then who was she, who broke my car's glass and asked me for lift?

691
00:59:41,583 --> 00:59:44,708
I went to her house with the handkerchief, who was the she?

692
00:59:45,208 --> 00:59:48,416
Who was she who came to my show after I invited her?

693
00:59:48,916 --> 00:59:51,666
Who was she who met me in Golden Club?

694
00:59:52,166 --> 00:59:53,750
Who was she who came to meet me in the hospital?

695
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:58,500
Who was she? Can you answer my question?

696
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,291
Why are you quiet? Why don't you answer him?

697
01:00:01,791 --> 01:00:08,500
How can you answer Meenu, I myself saw you embracing Ravi!

698
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,208
Vijay, you should be ashamed of talking to me this way!

699
01:00:14,708 --> 01:00:18,583
Do you think I am mad about your machismo?

700
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:21,458
I got impressed by his popularity and fell in love with him?

701
01:00:21,958 --> 01:00:23,875
Then one day I'll fall in for somebody's bravery..

702
01:00:24,375 --> 01:00:25,583
..and one day for somebody's courage.

703
01:00:26,083 --> 01:00:28,916
Do you think I am a prostitute?

704
01:00:29,416 --> 01:00:32,500
Vijay, I don't want to give any explanation now.

705
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,666
I am telling this for the last time that this is the first..

706
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:37,625
..time I am meeting Ravi. I only know you, I like you..

707
01:00:38,125 --> 01:00:39,583
..and I love you only. - Vijay, she is a cheater!

708
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:43,083
She is a fraud. She is lying. Shut up.

709
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:44,333
You shut up!

710
01:00:44,833 --> 01:00:48,333
Ravi!

711
01:01:25,458 --> 01:01:29,750
She is Meena.. Then who is she?

712
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:33,875
I've told you earlier who I am. - I understood it.

713
01:01:34,375 --> 01:01:36,458
I understood everything.

714
01:01:36,958 --> 01:01:39,916
Hey, this is called a miracle of God.

715
01:01:40,416 --> 01:01:42,416
One girl is born in London named Meenu and one..

716
01:01:42,916 --> 01:01:46,458
..girl is born in India named Meena.

717
01:01:46,958 --> 01:01:52,083
Same face, same age. Anybody can become a fool.

718
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:54,833
God, if you wouldn't have sent Meena on the right time..

719
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:56,791
..who knows what would've happened.

720
01:01:57,291 --> 01:02:01,875
Ravi. - Meena, Meena. I'll make you understand later.

721
01:02:02,375 --> 01:02:05,833
Sister-in-law, my sweet sister-in-law, please forgive me.

722
01:02:06,333 --> 01:02:10,708
I was helpless in love and in anger misbehaved with you.

723
01:02:11,208 --> 01:02:13,125
Please. Please forgive me. - It is alright.

724
01:02:13,625 --> 01:02:15,250
If I were in your place I would've also..

725
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:17,291
.. probably done the same thing.

726
01:02:17,791 --> 01:02:21,500
At this moment, I believe one thing that your love for us..

727
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,333
..in sincere and honest. - If I couldn't have come today..

728
01:02:25,833 --> 01:02:27,333
..God knows what would've happened.

729
01:02:27,833 --> 01:02:29,750
All this fight was because of you both being identical.

730
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:32,666
And we were thinking that one girl fooled us both.

731
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:35,250
It is good that you reached on the right time.

732
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:37,916
The best part is that you haven't worn same dress.

733
01:02:38,416 --> 01:02:42,000
Or else I don't know what..

734
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:48,916
No, no. No more confusion. She is okay for me. She is fine.

735
01:02:49,416 --> 01:02:52,416
Anyways, we all will sit together and talk later.

736
01:02:52,916 --> 01:02:55,125
Ravi, immediately come to my house as my father is leaving..

737
01:02:55,625 --> 01:02:56,583
..to America and wants to meet you now.

738
01:02:57,083 --> 01:03:00,083
One minute, one minute. Okay, Vijay, we will make a move now.

739
01:03:00,583 --> 01:03:02,666
By the way it is better to leave you both alone now.

740
01:03:03,166 --> 01:03:04,416
Miss. Meenu, take care of him.

741
01:03:04,916 --> 01:03:10,166
He was talking all rubbish about you. - Hey!

742
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:14,166
Oh my God. - Bye, see you. - Bye. See you, bye.

743
01:03:22,375 --> 01:03:24,833
I am sorry, Meenu. I doubted you.

744
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:29,666
I actually went mad. Today I believe that I have become..

745
01:03:30,166 --> 01:03:35,583
..blind and crazy in your love. I am sorry.

746
01:03:36,083 --> 01:03:40,833
You look so innocent when you say 'sorry'.

747
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:43,041
I swear if you were in London, then..

748
01:03:43,541 --> 01:03:46,583
Hey! Forget about London now. Do you think our India is less?

749
01:03:47,083 --> 01:03:50,583
Yes!

750
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:47,250
"Our eyes met and we both got lost."

751
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:54,916
"Our eyes met and we both got lost."

752
01:04:55,416 --> 01:05:02,916
"Our hearts beat faster and we both got lost."

753
01:05:03,416 --> 01:05:06,791
"The spring is here. - We both are in love."

754
01:05:07,291 --> 01:05:10,416
"We both are ready for it."

755
01:05:10,916 --> 01:05:17,875
"Our eyes met and we both got lost."

756
01:05:18,375 --> 01:05:25,750
"Our hearts beat faster and we both got lost."

757
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:27,750
"The spring is here."

758
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:29,791
"We both are in love."

759
01:05:30,291 --> 01:05:33,250
"We both are ready for it."

760
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:37,250
"Our eyes met and we both got lost."

761
01:06:06,291 --> 01:06:09,541
"Our moods have changed these days."

762
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:17,458
"We've forgotten all our work these days."

763
01:06:17,958 --> 01:06:21,250
"Love rules our hearts these days."

764
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:24,958
"Love is blossoming these days."

765
01:06:25,458 --> 01:06:29,083
"There's music on our lips. -There's love in our lives."

766
01:06:29,583 --> 01:06:32,500
"It's victory of our love."

767
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:40,000
"Day and night we keep dreaming and we are lost."

768
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:44,000
"Our eyes met and we both got lost."

769
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:22,458
"Let's forget our differences and embrace."

770
01:07:22,958 --> 01:07:30,166
"There are no distances between us now."

771
01:07:30,666 --> 01:07:33,958
"Let this world be jealous."

772
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:38,041
"Let's live in each other's arms."

773
01:07:38,541 --> 01:07:41,833
"We both are free. -We both are together."

774
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:45,333
"Now who remembers sadness."

775
01:07:45,833 --> 01:07:52,875
"The words are banned and we are lost."

776
01:07:53,375 --> 01:08:00,500
"Our eyes met and we both got lost."

777
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:08,291
"Our hearts beat faster and we both got lost."

778
01:08:08,791 --> 01:08:12,375
"The spring is here. - We both are in love."

779
01:08:12,875 --> 01:08:15,708
"We both are ready for it."

780
01:08:16,208 --> 01:08:19,708
"Our eyes met and we both got.."

781
01:08:38,083 --> 01:08:39,958
Today Jai Kishan is being released.

782
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:42,083
What difference does it make! Once he is released..

783
01:08:42,583 --> 01:08:44,416
..he will fight for some poor man and come back here again.

784
01:08:44,916 --> 01:08:47,291
Brother Jai Kishan! Brother Jai Kishan!

785
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:50,125
Get up, brother, today you are being released, sir.

786
01:08:50,625 --> 01:08:54,958
Shut up! - Sir.

787
01:08:55,458 --> 01:08:58,375
There is only one sir, the one who is up there

788
01:08:58,875 --> 01:09:01,125
I am only his devotee, his devotee..

789
01:09:01,625 --> 01:09:04,333
The release order comes from Him, not from the government.

790
01:09:04,833 --> 01:09:06,416
Get lost! - You wanted to be released..

791
01:09:06,916 --> 01:09:08,750
..before Diwali, so it is accepted.

792
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:12,750
Tomorrow is Diwali, so I came to give you the news.

793
01:09:18,958 --> 01:09:19,625
Tomorrow is Diwali.

794
01:09:20,125 --> 01:09:24,833
Forgive me, Hiralal, I betrayed you.

795
01:09:25,333 --> 01:09:27,916
The girl's photograph, which you showed it to me..

796
01:09:28,416 --> 01:09:32,541
..after I saw that I fell for her. I stabbed a knife in your back.

797
01:09:33,041 --> 01:09:35,416
No, actually I stabbed a knife on your heart.

798
01:09:35,916 --> 01:09:40,583
I betrayed you and got married to that girl.

799
01:09:41,083 --> 01:09:44,500
But on the nuptial night..

800
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:51,875
Open your drape.. wow! You are like a burning sun..

801
01:09:52,375 --> 01:09:54,500
No, no, your face is like a moon.

802
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,583
On that note let's take a betel leaf.

803
01:09:58,083 --> 01:10:00,208
Ghani.. - Who is it?

804
01:10:00,708 --> 01:10:03,375
I am talking to you dear. I am Ghani?

805
01:10:03,875 --> 01:10:09,250
Yes, from now on I will call you Ghani.

806
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:12,041
Why?

807
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:15,375
Because you love me very much.

808
01:10:15,875 --> 01:10:19,625
Look till today none of husbands made me eat betel leaf.

809
01:10:20,125 --> 01:10:24,000
None of your husbands? How many husbands did you have earlier?

810
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:29,208
Before this I have been married four times.

811
01:10:29,708 --> 01:10:32,083
What happened, Ghani? Do you have any objection?

812
01:10:32,583 --> 01:10:37,250
No, Yes, Actually I have forgotten the direction of Yes and No.

813
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,750
The other husbands that you mentioned just now..

814
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:42,916
Where are they? - Forget about them now.

815
01:10:43,416 --> 01:10:45,000
Why are you talking about them on our nuptial night?

816
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,500
This is not nuptial night, but a very unfortunate night.

817
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,041
Tell me about all those four men or else I can't sleep tonight.

818
01:10:50,541 --> 01:10:53,500
Okay, just in few days of our marriage I came to know..

819
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,458
..that he didn't love me, but they loved my wealth.

820
01:10:56,958 --> 01:11:00,875
Then what, we used to go to hill station for honeymoon.

821
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:04,625
..we used to go together and I alone used to come back.

822
01:11:05,125 --> 01:11:08,541
Where will we go for our honeymoon?

823
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:15,500
Oh Ghani! I like high mountains and deep chasms.

824
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,791
It is very romantic. How do you feel, Ghani?

825
01:11:19,291 --> 01:11:24,875
Oh my God. The next day itself I divorced her.

826
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:27,791
Thank God, my life is saved. My hair is safe.

827
01:11:28,291 --> 01:11:30,166
I am very relaxed now, otherwise I would've lost all my hair.

828
01:11:30,666 --> 01:11:31,833
Actually I wanted to see you bald.

829
01:11:32,333 --> 01:11:34,000
What do you mean? - I already knew..

830
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,000
..everything about that girl. That is the reason I gave..

831
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:37,583
..you her snap, so that you woo her, you trap her.

832
01:11:38,083 --> 01:11:39,000
..and then she would throw you in a chasm.

833
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:40,750
Oh, I see! Was this your friendship?

834
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:42,916
What was your friendship, brother?

835
01:11:43,416 --> 01:11:45,000
I was just testing your friendship.

836
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:46,666
Oh, was that a test! - Yes, nowadays the..

837
01:11:47,166 --> 01:11:52,500
..pattern of test has changed a bit.

838
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,333
Sir, you celebrate the best Diwali in town.

839
01:11:56,833 --> 01:11:59,541
What celebration! - Diwali.

840
01:12:00,041 --> 01:12:01,416
Oh, thanks a lot. Thank you.

841
01:12:01,916 --> 01:12:05,416
Hey, get a glass of whisky.

842
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:11,583
Wow, what a party and what expensive drinks!

843
01:12:12,083 --> 01:12:13,916
You are having fun here? - Then what do you expect..

844
01:12:14,416 --> 01:12:16,125
..me to do, to sit and cry because you came back?

845
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:17,708
How did you come here from Jail?

846
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:21,333
Sir, I had to come. To wish you Diwali I had to come here.

847
01:12:21,833 --> 01:12:23,916
There is Diwali here, but our colony is in darkness.

848
01:12:24,416 --> 01:12:26,083
This is not an electricity office.

849
01:12:26,583 --> 01:12:27,416
This is a house of respectable people.

850
01:12:27,916 --> 01:12:31,500
And this is a party for respectable people, not for loafers like you.

851
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,041
I know how respectable these people are.

852
01:12:34,541 --> 01:12:35,333
By the way, I didn't come here to fight, I just came here to..

853
01:12:35,833 --> 01:12:36,833
..talk regarding the poor people's rights.

854
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:39,333
What nonsense! They work for me and I pay them wages..

855
01:12:39,833 --> 01:12:41,625
..and the matter is settled there.

856
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:44,375
Sir, blood is cheaper, but not the sweat, as you are giving..

857
01:12:44,875 --> 01:12:47,250
..them so less money. Now don't spoil my mood and..

858
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:51,583
..give the poor people their bonus with respect.

859
01:12:52,083 --> 01:12:54,541
So do you take money for watching faces?

860
01:12:55,041 --> 01:12:56,916
He has come here for bonus. Throw him outside!

861
01:12:57,416 --> 01:13:01,375
If you come near me, then you won't go back on your own feet.

862
01:13:01,875 --> 01:13:05,375
Now get lost from here! Go! Get lost!

863
01:13:10,583 --> 01:13:12,875
Why are you coming close to me? What nonsense is this?

864
01:13:13,375 --> 01:13:17,041
What is this! - Cracker.

865
01:13:17,541 --> 01:13:21,208
If I light this the whole structure of your face..

866
01:13:21,708 --> 01:13:23,166
..will change. - No, brother Jai Kishan.

867
01:13:23,666 --> 01:13:25,250
Now I understand everything. Actually the thing is, I..

868
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:28,041
..haven't met any intelligent person like you in my whole life.

869
01:13:28,541 --> 01:13:30,958
I always cry about the plight of the poor people in the colony.

870
01:13:31,458 --> 01:13:34,750
Sir, you need not cry, just arrange for the bonus. What?

871
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:38,750
Bonus. - Bonus? Actually the thing is -Yes, yes.. Bro..

872
01:13:47,375 --> 01:13:49,541
Shall I tell you something, brother Jai Kishan?

873
01:13:50,041 --> 01:13:52,291
Yes, tell me. - Why don't you become a security officer..

874
01:13:52,791 --> 01:13:55,958
..in our factory? - What did you say? What?

875
01:13:56,458 --> 01:14:00,208
Nothing. Nothing, I am getting it. - Bonus.

876
01:14:00,708 --> 01:14:04,208
Yes, yes, I am getting the same amount.

877
01:14:08,791 --> 01:14:10,750
Happy Diwali! Happy Diwali, dear children.

878
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:13,166
Yes, have fun. Enjoy yourself.

879
01:14:13,666 --> 01:14:18,125
It is for everybody. For everyone.

880
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:20,583
Hey, aunty, why are you sitting so sad on such an..

881
01:14:21,083 --> 01:14:24,750
..auspicious day, what do you want, aunty? Tell me.

882
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:29,125
The whole life keep lighting the house of the poor people.

883
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:32,291
You don't want light in your own dark house?

884
01:14:32,791 --> 01:14:34,541
Think about yourself too son. Why do you want to stay..

885
01:14:35,041 --> 01:14:37,375
..alone leaving your family members?

886
01:14:37,875 --> 01:14:39,375
Come on, uncle. Why do you want to talk all this on this..

887
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:41,875
..happy occasion? If you people are happy it is like..

888
01:14:42,375 --> 01:14:47,291
..Id and Diwali to me. - May God always keep you happy.

889
01:14:47,791 --> 01:14:50,708
Come on, children, have fun.

890
01:14:51,208 --> 01:14:54,458
Now what do we tell him! He has made strangers..

891
01:14:54,958 --> 01:14:56,875
..his family members and his own family members made him a stranger.

892
01:14:57,375 --> 01:14:59,458
You scoundrel, I am not going to leave you today.

893
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:02,041
Hey, hello, excuse me. Hey, Mr. Ravi Kumar, he is a singer.

894
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:03,833
My name is Jai Kishan and I am very big fan of yours.

895
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,208
Thank you, this is my friend, Vijay. - Hello. - Hello.

896
01:15:06,708 --> 01:15:07,541
Hey uncle, didn't you recognize him?

897
01:15:08,041 --> 01:15:08,916
He is Mr. Ravi Kumar. He is a famous singer.

898
01:15:09,416 --> 01:15:10,500
Is he a singer? - Yes.

899
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,875
You are such a.. - Are you trying to abuse me?

900
01:15:14,375 --> 01:15:15,750
Tell me what? Tell me. Speak up, what do you want to say?

901
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:17,500
Hey, brother, today we are going to dance..

902
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,291
..so tell him to sing a Punjabi song.

903
01:15:19,791 --> 01:15:22,500
"Your mother and my mother became good friends.."

904
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,291
Oh great, wonderful! Wonderful idea, brother.

905
01:15:25,791 --> 01:15:31,041
Hey, sing a nice song. Do you know any Bhangra song? - Yes.

906
01:15:31,541 --> 01:15:33,416
Then please start. Come. - Come, let's sing and dance.

907

Come, come, let's go. Oh wow, wonderful!

"Talk openly and the party will be on."

910
01:16:18,458 --> 01:16:21,958
"Have a large peg and dance."

911
01:16:22,458 --> 01:16:25,333
"Talk openly and the party will be on."

912
01:16:25,833 --> 01:16:28,708
"Have a large peg and dance."

913
01:16:29,208 --> 01:16:32,333
"We are dancing."

914
01:16:32,833 --> 01:16:36,333
"We are dancing."

915
01:17:02,208 --> 01:17:05,375
"Sometimes No!"

916
01:17:05,875 --> 01:17:08,875
"Sometimes she says no!

917
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:12,708
"When ever she is in the den, she says no!"

918
01:17:13,208 --> 01:17:16,708
"When ever she is in the den, she says no!"

919
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,708
"This is good time, the best moment has come today."

920
01:17:28,208 --> 01:17:31,083
"Today friends have gathered and are having fun."

921

"This is good time, the best moment has come today."

922
01:17:35,208 --> 01:17:38,375

"I roamed the world for twelve years and I got potatoes."

928
01:18:24,416 --> 01:18:26,750

01:18:48,666 --> 01:18:51,583
"Oh God, everyone got to know of your love."

01:18:52,083 --> 01:18:55,583
"One more lover is born in this world."

934
01:19:03,458 --> 01:19:06,375
"God knows when will you look deep into my eyes."

935

"But if yu smile.. But if you smile then I'll fall for you."

938
01:19:21,375 --> 01:19:24,416
"We are dancing."

939
01:19:24,916 --> 01:19:28,500
"We are dancing."

940
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,125
"Talk openly and the party will be on."

941
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:35,375
"Have a large peg and dance."

942
01:19:35,875 --> 01:19:38,958
"We are dancing."

943
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:42,666
"We are dancing."

944
01:19:43,166 --> 01:19:46,333
"We are dancing."

945
01:19:46,833 --> 01:19:49,958
"We are dancing."

946
01:19:50,458 --> 01:19:53,541
"We are dancing."

947
01:19:54,041 --> 01:19:57,375
"We are dancing."

948
01:19:57,875 --> 01:20:01,000
"We are dancing."

949
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:07,833
"We are dancing."

950
01:20:08,333 --> 01:20:11,083
Attention to remaining passengers flying by..

951
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:15,250
..international flight U13..

952
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:20,375
Vijay, I am not going to London forever.

953
01:20:20,875 --> 01:20:24,083
Please I can't see you being sad like this.

954
01:20:24,583 --> 01:20:27,708
Don't you want me to go to London and talk to my father..

955
01:20:28,208 --> 01:20:31,375
..about our marriage? - Meenu, do you have faith..

956
01:20:31,875 --> 01:20:36,333
..that your daddy will agree?

957
01:20:36,833 --> 01:20:39,958
If he was just my father, then he wouldn't have agreed.

958
01:20:40,458 --> 01:20:43,041
But he is more like a mother to me than my father.

959
01:20:43,541 --> 01:20:46,875
My father is bald. Do you know why?

960
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:50,916
Because he became bald fulfilling all my wishes.

961
01:20:51,416 --> 01:20:52,875
My father is a gem of a person, Vijay.

962
01:20:53,375 --> 01:20:56,833
He has always selected the best things for me.

963
01:20:57,333 --> 01:20:58,375
That is the reason, he will never..

964
01:20:58,875 --> 01:21:01,625
..say 'no' to this relationship.

965
01:21:02,125 --> 01:21:05,958
Then I will come back to my Vijay forever.

966
01:21:06,458 --> 01:21:09,833
Vijay, there is good news for you.

967
01:21:10,333 --> 01:21:11,958
Meenu has changed her decision about going to London.

968
01:21:12,458 --> 01:21:15,166
Not at all. - Then, for how long will you talk like this?

969
01:21:15,666 --> 01:21:17,291
Then see the time. Meenu, if continue to talk to him like this

970
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:20,166
..then you'll stand here till tomorrow morning.

971
01:21:20,666 --> 01:21:23,250
He is like old emotional film hero.

972
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:25,666
His scenes never end fast. Come on, move now..

973
01:21:26,166 --> 01:21:29,125
It is time for your flight.

974
01:21:29,625 --> 01:21:31,291
Okay, Meenu, you take.. - You take care of yourself.

975
01:21:31,791 --> 01:21:33,208
Give a call as soon as your reach there.

976
01:21:33,708 --> 01:21:35,041
I will wait for your call. Make your father understand.

977
01:21:35,541 --> 01:21:37,541
I will wait for you to come back, etc. etc. etc.

978
01:21:38,041 --> 01:21:41,208
Vijay, let her go. She is getting late.

979
01:21:41,708 --> 01:21:45,208
Meenu.

980
01:21:48,458 --> 01:21:51,458
Tell your father that his another daughter is in India..

981
01:21:51,958 --> 01:21:55,000
..who resembles you a lot. She has sent her regards to him.

982
01:21:55,500 --> 01:22:02,291
Okay. - Come, let's go, Meena, let's leave them alone..

983
01:22:02,791 --> 01:22:05,708
..for few minutes, for few minutes only.

984
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:09,708
Bye. - Bye. - Bye.

985
01:22:10,208 --> 01:22:13,708
Only few minutes.

986
01:22:15,958 --> 01:22:18,750
I love you, Meenu. I love you.

987
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:22,750
Let me go or else I'll be late.

988
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:37,583
Bye!

989
01:23:07,583 --> 01:23:12,000
'After going to London I'll be restless till I meet you again.'

990
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:16,000
'It is better that I call my father here only. Yes.'

991
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:36,083
Hello! - Hello, Ravi, Meenu here.

992
01:23:36,583 --> 01:23:38,791
Yes, Meenu. How are you? Did you reach London safely?

993
01:23:39,291 --> 01:23:43,125
I didn't go to London, I am very close to you here itself.

994
01:23:43,625 --> 01:23:46,500
Hey, Meenu, stop joking! Okay tell me, what is going on?

995
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,541
Hey, when I told you that I am here itself..

996
01:23:50,041 --> 01:23:51,208
..why don't you believe me? - If Vijay comes and bugs me..

997
01:23:51,708 --> 01:23:53,166
..and ask me your details, what will I answer him?

998
01:23:53,666 --> 01:24:00,500
Caught you! Look, I fooled you. Hey, I reached London safely.

999
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,458
I played this prank just because even though..

1000
01:24:02,958 --> 01:24:03,958
..I am in London I can see you both..

1001
01:24:04,458 --> 01:24:05,791
..in front of me.

1002
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:08,791
Tell Vijay that I will call in evening and to wait for my call.

1003
01:24:09,291 --> 01:24:11,833
I need not tell him. He will run and come in the evening here.

1004
01:24:12,333 --> 01:24:14,958
See you. Take care. Bye!

1005
01:24:15,458 --> 01:24:18,958
It will be great fun now.

1006
01:24:24,291 --> 01:24:27,791
Taxi! Taxi!

1007
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:41,458
Hey! What are you doing?

1008
01:24:41,958 --> 01:24:43,583
Leave me! Help!

1009
01:24:44,083 --> 01:24:44,791
Look, we don't care..

1010
01:24:45,291 --> 01:24:46,541
..if you are Meenu or Meena.

1011
01:24:47,041 --> 01:24:50,333
We only know one thing that our nephew likes you very much.

1012
01:24:50,833 --> 01:24:52,125
Then why are you acting smart?

1013
01:24:52,625 --> 01:24:54,750
She is pretending as if she doesn't know me.

1014
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:57,375
She is pretending as if she doesn't know me.

1015
01:24:57,875 --> 01:25:01,250
What do you think you can fool me so easily?

1016
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:03,791
For God's sake, please leave me.

1017
01:25:04,291 --> 01:25:06,208
My daddy doesn't have anybody other than me.

1018
01:25:06,708 --> 01:25:08,625
O daddy! - He will die.

1019
01:25:09,125 --> 01:25:10,541
Look what is she saying! Your daddy is not alone.

1020
01:25:11,041 --> 01:25:11,791
We all are there with him.

1021
01:25:12,291 --> 01:25:13,416
He has got such a great son-in-law.

1022
01:25:13,916 --> 01:25:16,041
We all are guards for your entire property.

1023
01:25:16,541 --> 01:25:18,291
Property? What are you talking about!

1024
01:25:18,791 --> 01:25:20,750
Hey, enough! Shut up now!

1025
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:23,500
Mahinder, go and give a call her boyfriend. - Okay.

1026
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,291
Tell him to get the property papers or else we will kill her.

1027
01:25:25,791 --> 01:25:29,291
Get lost!

1028
01:25:33,958 --> 01:25:36,125
Hello! - You don't know us, Mr. Ravi..

1029
01:25:36,625 --> 01:25:38,541
D..and don't even try to know about us..

1030
01:25:39,041 --> 01:25:40,541
..because we are heartless people.

1031
01:25:41,041 --> 01:25:43,166
Yes, I wanted to tell you that..

1032
01:25:43,666 --> 01:25:46,291
..your Meenakshi is in our custody.

1033
01:25:46,791 --> 01:25:47,166
Is it so?

1034
01:25:47,666 --> 01:25:50,208
The property that Meenakshi's father has willed in your name.

1035
01:25:50,708 --> 01:25:53,041
..we want that now.

1036
01:25:53,541 --> 01:25:54,791
And if I say I won't do that?

1037
01:25:55,291 --> 01:25:57,500
We will kill your Meenakshi.

1038
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,250
For this we are giving you 24 hours time.

1039
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:02,166
Is that so?

1040
01:26:02,666 --> 01:26:04,541
Then you do one thing..

1041
01:26:05,041 --> 01:26:07,833
You give me a call after 24 hours.

1042
01:26:08,333 --> 01:26:09,083
Yes, the thing that you said you'll do, finish..

1043
01:26:09,583 --> 01:26:10,291
..that and give me a call.

1044
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:14,208
By the way, I have some urgent work to do. Okay!

1045
01:26:14,708 --> 01:26:15,083
Who called you up?

1046
01:26:15,583 --> 01:26:16,625
Just like that. Somebody played a prank.

1047
01:26:17,125 --> 01:26:17,541
Come on, now make it fast.

1048
01:26:18,041 --> 01:26:20,791
We are getting late for the party.

1049
01:26:21,291 --> 01:26:25,208
What are you looking at? - You are look very beautiful.

1050
01:26:25,708 --> 01:26:28,458
Come on now.

1051
01:26:28,958 --> 01:26:30,125
What? - Yes.

1052
01:26:30,625 --> 01:26:34,125
He said we can do whatever we want to do

1053
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:38,583
Okay, fine.

1054
01:26:39,083 --> 01:26:40,750
Then we'll do such thing with her..

1055
01:26:41,250 --> 01:26:42,666
..that even her boyfriend will come to know..

1056
01:26:43,166 --> 01:26:46,625
..that we do whatever we say.

1057
01:26:47,125 --> 01:26:48,958
Please, please let me go.

1058
01:26:49,458 --> 01:26:52,041
You.. You want money, right?

1059
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:55,250
I'll go to London and send you as much as money you want.

1060
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:57,208
Please, please leave me.

1061
01:26:57,708 --> 01:27:00,958
She wants to go to London.

1062
01:27:01,458 --> 01:27:04,958
She wants to run away from me.

1063
01:27:10,875 --> 01:27:11,375
You will go to London?

1064
01:27:11,875 --> 01:27:12,750
Yes.

1065
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:15,083
You will go to London?

1066
01:27:15,583 --> 01:27:17,583
Go, please go.

1067
01:27:18,083 --> 01:27:22,125
Go, leave now.

1068
01:27:22,625 --> 01:27:26,125
I won't do anything, please leave.

1069
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:32,250
Please leave me.

1070
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:38,958
Hey, come on, beautiful.

1071
01:27:39,458 --> 01:27:40,541
Please leave me.

1072
01:27:41,041 --> 01:27:44,541
Leave you?

1073
01:27:45,958 --> 01:27:46,916
Shall I go?

1074
01:27:47,416 --> 01:27:50,916
Go, nephew, go and have fun.

1075
01:27:59,333 --> 01:28:00,166
Leave me!

1076
01:28:00,666 --> 01:28:04,166
Leave!

1077
01:28:37,333 --> 01:28:37,500
Hello!

1078
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,291
Hello, Mr. Ravi Kumar? - Yes.

1079
01:28:39,791 --> 01:28:42,041
Hello, I am inspector Rajan Chawal speaking.

1080
01:28:42,541 --> 01:28:42,750
Yes, tell me.

1081
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:44,291
We've found a corpse at Madh island..

1082
01:28:44,791 --> 01:28:47,458
..who has got your address and card.

1083
01:28:47,958 --> 01:28:51,458
Corpse?

1084
01:28:54,958 --> 01:28:55,833
Please come, Mr. Ravi.

1085
01:28:56,333 --> 01:28:57,625
We were waiting for you.

1086
01:28:58,125 --> 01:29:01,625
Come, the corpse is there.

1087
01:29:18,208 --> 01:29:21,708
Meenu!

1088
01:29:27,541 --> 01:29:30,541
Meenu!

1089
01:29:31,041 --> 01:29:34,541
Meenu!

1090
01:29:49,791 --> 01:29:53,291
Hello!

1091
01:29:58,041 --> 01:30:01,708
'I didn't go to London, I am very close to you here itself.'

1092
01:30:02,208 --> 01:30:07,291
'We will kill your Meenakshi.'

1093
01:30:07,791 --> 01:30:11,500
Inspector, I know her.

1094
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,333
You can hand over the corpse to me.

1095
01:30:13,833 --> 01:30:14,375
Okay.

1096
01:30:14,875 --> 01:30:15,958
Mr. Singh. - Yes, sir.

1097
01:30:16,458 --> 01:30:17,458
You finish the formalities. - Okay.

1098
01:30:17,958 --> 01:30:20,375
Mr. Ravi, it will take two minutes, till then you..

1099
01:30:20,875 --> 01:30:24,375
No, I am ok here. - Okay.

1100
01:31:18,416 --> 01:31:21,500
My beloved has gone away from me. My life is in dark.

1101
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,583
Why are you sitting in dark? Tell me, buddy.

1102
01:31:27,083 --> 01:31:32,083
Why are you worried? - Can't I drink in the pain..

1103
01:31:32,583 --> 01:31:35,500
..of Meenu's departure?

1104
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:40,250
I know that she is your girlfriend..

1105
01:31:40,750 --> 01:31:44,250
..but she was a good friend of mine.

1106
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:51,875
She was my well-wisher. I.. I lost a good friend.

1107
01:31:52,375 --> 01:31:54,916
Don't worry, friend. Meenu might call up now.

1108
01:31:55,416 --> 01:31:57,583
Talk to her as much as you want to.

1109
01:31:58,083 --> 01:32:00,916
By now she should've called up.

1110
01:32:01,416 --> 01:32:05,333
What if she forgets to give you a call?

1111
01:32:05,833 --> 01:32:09,666
Forgets?

1112
01:32:10,166 --> 01:32:15,333
Ravi, if today Meenu doesn't call me up, then..

1113
01:32:15,833 --> 01:32:22,416
..my dear friend, remember one thing I'll kill myself.

1114
01:32:22,916 --> 01:32:27,916
Ravi, I think I am very fortunate that I got a friend like you and..

1115
01:32:28,416 --> 01:32:29,750
..a girlfriend like Meenu.

1116
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:32,583
If any one of you is separated from me..

1117
01:32:33,083 --> 01:32:41,166
..then you'll see, Ravi, that day will be the last day of my life.

1118
01:32:41,666 --> 01:32:48,750
Ravi, I love Meenu a lot. Ravi, I love her very, very, very much.

1119
01:32:49,250 --> 01:32:53,500
Vijay, spend your time remembering her..

1120
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,500
I'll be right back. Okay?

1121
01:33:01,083 --> 01:33:04,000
Hello! - Meena, I am Ravi speaking.

1122
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:07,000
What is the matter, Ravi? - Meena, Vijay has come here.

1123
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:09,083
What did he say? - He isn't telling anything ..

1124
01:33:09,583 --> 01:33:13,166
..but is sitting here expecting Meenu's call from London..

1125
01:33:13,666 --> 01:33:16,583
And if he doesn't get a call he'll commit suicide.

1126
01:33:17,083 --> 01:33:19,500
Meena, I can't see Vijay being..

1127
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,083
..restless and suffering like this.

1128
01:33:22,583 --> 01:33:27,666
But how long can you hide without telling Vijay about Meenu's death?

1129
01:33:28,166 --> 01:33:31,416
I called you up thinking about the same thing.

1130
01:33:31,916 --> 01:33:33,166
I have a small request.

1131
01:33:33,666 --> 01:33:37,916
Please don't say 'no'. - What are you telling, Ravi!

1132
01:33:38,416 --> 01:33:40,916
Make a call to my home as Meenu.

1133
01:33:41,416 --> 01:33:43,666
Only I will know that it is you who has called up.

1134
01:33:44,166 --> 01:33:47,666
But for Vijay, this call will be from his Meenu from London.

1135
01:34:02,083 --> 01:34:04,916
Hello! - Vijay. Meenu. - Meenu, I was desperately waiting for..

1136
01:34:05,416 --> 01:34:08,083
..this evening. I was so desperate that I was wishing..

1137
01:34:08,583 --> 01:34:11,666
..the sun to set sooner and you give me a call.

1138
01:34:12,166 --> 01:34:13,916
Meenu, but today the sun troubled me a lot.

1139
01:34:14,416 --> 01:34:15,083
It made me very restless today.

1140
01:34:15,583 --> 01:34:19,916
It wasn't setting at all. Meenu, I can't stay without..

1141
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:23,416
O Meenu! I love you. I love you, Meenu.

1142
01:34:23,916 --> 01:34:27,250
I am poor man who doesn't have anything else other than..

1143
01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:32,083
..your love and Ravi's friendship.

1144
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:36,833
Meenu, after you left there is only darkness in my life.

1145
01:34:37,333 --> 01:34:41,250
Are you listening to me, Meenu?

1146
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:46,416
Meenu, people celebrate Id and Diwali..

1147
01:34:46,916 --> 01:34:50,500
But do you know when I will celebrate Id and Diwali?

1148
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:55,083
When you come back to India! That day will be the happiest..

1149
01:34:55,583 --> 01:34:57,166
..day of my life, Meenu. I will love you more than my life.

1150
01:34:57,666 --> 01:34:59,666
I will never let you go away from me.

1151
01:35:00,166 --> 01:35:02,666
Meenu, when are you coming back? When are you coming back?

1152
01:35:03,166 --> 01:35:05,750
I don't think I can ever come back. - I'll die right now, Meenu

1153
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:08,500
I am helpless, Vijay. - Hey, Meenu, how did..

1154
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,583
..helplessness come in between us?

1155
01:35:12,083 --> 01:35:17,583
Tell that to go away. - The matter is serious.

1156
01:35:18,083 --> 01:35:21,416
My father has fixed my marriage somewhere else.

1157
01:35:21,916 --> 01:35:25,833
Try to forget me. Don't even think of living..

1158
01:35:26,333 --> 01:35:33,750
..with my memories. Just think as though we never met.

1159
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:38,000
Meenu, are you playing a prank with me?

1160
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:40,583
Try to believe it as soon as possible.

1161
01:35:41,083 --> 01:35:44,583
You will suffer less.

1162
01:35:46,583 --> 01:35:50,083
Only a human can feel the pain..

1163
01:35:50,583 --> 01:35:52,333
..but there are no feelings left in a corpse.

1164
01:35:52,833 --> 01:35:58,583
I am hanging up.. - Meenu, there is silence all around me.

1165
01:35:59,083 --> 01:36:04,583
I am only hoping for one word now. Joke..

1166
01:36:05,083 --> 01:36:06,416
Meenu, please tell me that this is joke.

1167
01:36:06,916 --> 01:36:11,166
This is not a joke, but it's the fact, Vijay.

1168
01:36:11,666 --> 01:36:13,833
'It's the fact! It's the fact! It's the fact!'

1169
01:36:14,333 --> 01:36:17,833
'It's the fact!'

1170
01:36:24,083 --> 01:36:27,583
Vijay.. Vijay! Vijay!

1171
01:36:35,166 --> 01:36:42,916
Hello! Hello! Hey, phone is disconnected.

1172
01:36:43,416 --> 01:36:50,583
Buddy, not only the phone, but our relationship is disconnected.

1173
01:36:51,083 --> 01:36:52,083
Our relationship is disconnected! - Vijay!

1174
01:36:52,583 --> 01:36:56,083
Vijay!

1175
01:37:14,583 --> 01:37:18,083
I can't stay without you even for a moment. Lie!

1176
01:37:29,083 --> 01:37:32,583
My father has fixed my marriage somewhere else.

1177
01:38:26,416 --> 01:38:29,916
Come on, make it fast! Run!

1178
01:38:44,083 --> 01:38:47,083
You've saved his life by getting him here on time.

1179
01:38:47,583 --> 01:38:48,916
Don't worry, he will be alright.

1180
01:38:49,416 --> 01:38:53,583
If you need something, please call me. - Certainly!

1181
01:38:54,083 --> 01:38:55,666
Don't worry, I will.

1182
01:38:56,166 --> 01:38:56,500
Doctor. - Yes.

1183
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,833
This is the blood report of the patient on bed No - 3.

1184
01:38:59,333 --> 01:39:01,000
Vijay! - You give this report.. - Where is Vijay?

1185
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:03,166
What happened to him? How did this happen?

1186
01:39:03,666 --> 01:39:11,166
Oh my God! Doctor! Doctor! How is my son, now?

1187
01:39:11,666 --> 01:39:15,416
Where is my son? What happened to Vijay?

1188
01:39:15,916 --> 01:39:17,250
Now he is out of danger. - My son.

1189
01:39:17,750 --> 01:39:20,416
We will shift him in another room.

1190
01:39:20,916 --> 01:39:22,833
But if that angel wouldn't have brought him here on time..

1191
01:39:23,333 --> 01:39:24,333
..then anything could've happened.

1192
01:39:24,833 --> 01:39:27,166
Doctor, who is that man who did such a big favor on us..

1193
01:39:27,666 --> 01:39:29,833
..by bring Vijay here on time? - I think he left.

1194
01:39:30,333 --> 01:39:33,833
But he said his name is Jai Kishan. Excuse me!

1195
01:39:48,333 --> 01:39:52,833
Son, Ravi, what happened to Vijay?

1196
01:39:53,333 --> 01:39:57,250
How did this happen? Son, you are intelligent.

1197
01:39:57,750 --> 01:40:02,500
How did you let all this happen?

1198
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,583
I am sorry to say, but the fact is that the patient is..

1199
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:08,833
..badly hurt emotionally than physically..

1200
01:40:09,333 --> 01:40:14,666
..by some girl called Meenu. - Son, Meenu?

1201
01:40:15,166 --> 01:40:18,500
Who is this Meenu? I don't understand anything.

1202
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:22,083
Mother, I've understood everything.

1203
01:40:22,583 --> 01:40:25,916
Mother, your son will be fine, very soon.

1204
01:40:26,416 --> 01:40:29,916
This is this son's promise to his mother. - Ravi!

1205
01:40:35,166 --> 01:40:38,666
What are you saying, Ravi! This is not possible.

1206
01:40:39,166 --> 01:40:41,750
I have to enact as Meenu and come into Vijay's life?

1207
01:40:42,250 --> 01:40:43,500
I have to play the drama of loving him.

1208
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:48,083
With this Vijay's, yours mine, all our lives will be ruined.

1209
01:40:48,583 --> 01:40:52,333
No. This is not done, Ravi. You forced me to enact as Meenu..

1210
01:40:52,833 --> 01:40:56,500
..and call him up, so I called up. You saw the consequences of that.

1211
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,500
Why aren't you telling him the truth?

1212
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:03,166
Meena.. he can't tolerate the truth in this state.

1213
01:41:03,666 --> 01:41:06,416
What if tomorrow he comes to know the truth?

1214
01:41:06,916 --> 01:41:07,750
Do you know how bad the consequences may be?

1215
01:41:08,250 --> 01:41:09,583
Have you thought about it?

1216
01:41:10,083 --> 01:41:11,500
After knowing the truth he will die thinking the one whom..

1217
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,666
..he is thinking as his Meenu, is actually his own..

1218
01:41:14,166 --> 01:41:16,666
.. friend's girlfriend Meena.

1219
01:41:17,166 --> 01:41:17,750
I don't want to think about..

1220
01:41:18,250 --> 01:41:20,416
..the consequences now, but only want to save Vijay's life..

1221
01:41:20,916 --> 01:41:23,500
..which is asking for help from his friend.

1222
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:29,083
A mother who is begging for his son's life.

1223
01:41:29,583 --> 01:41:33,000
Would you like your Ravi to get embarrassed in front of his mother?

1224
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:38,583
Meena, once Vijay is fine, I'll tell him everything.

1225
01:41:39,083 --> 01:41:42,750
Believe me, time heals every wounds

1226
01:41:43,250 --> 01:41:45,083
But Ravi, I.. - Please, Meena..

1227
01:41:45,583 --> 01:41:48,166
Don't tell me anything now.

1228
01:41:48,666 --> 01:41:54,416
If you love me, if you feel the pain that I am going through..

1229
01:41:54,916 --> 01:41:58,416
..then you'll surely realize my pain and help me out in this.

1230
01:42:07,333 --> 01:42:10,833
Hi, Vijay!

1231
01:42:21,416 --> 01:42:24,000
Why are you surprised? I am your Meenu.

1232
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:26,916
From London to the airport and straight from the airport..

1233
01:42:27,416 --> 01:42:29,000
..to you, I didn't even go home.

1234
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:31,500
Meenu, but you called up and said that, you..

1235
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:35,500
Hey, I was just joking. Try to remember that day was..

1236
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,333
..1st of April. - 1st April, what a strange joke that was!

1237
01:42:38,833 --> 01:42:44,333
You played a prank, but he tried committing suicide.

1238
01:42:44,833 --> 01:42:47,750
Did you try committing suicide?

1239
01:42:48,250 --> 01:42:53,250
That means I fooled him and he got fooled.

1240
01:42:53,750 --> 01:42:57,500
Sweetheart, if you were in London, your name would..

1241
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,750
..be registered in the Guinness book of world records.

1242
01:43:01,250 --> 01:43:04,750
Who is it?

1243
01:43:10,166 --> 01:43:13,916
Live long! You? - I..

1244
01:43:14,416 --> 01:43:18,500
Mother, she is.. Vijay's Meenu.

1245
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,083
I thought a girl from London will be full of attitude who..

1246
01:43:22,583 --> 01:43:25,750
..would only say Hi and Hello, but she is absolutely an Indian.

1247
01:43:26,250 --> 01:43:28,500
Mother, I am feeling very hungry.

1248
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:32,416
You please sit. I'll serve you hot food.

1249
01:43:32,916 --> 01:43:37,000
Meenu, do anything in life, but never play a prank like this..

1250
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:41,000
..ever again which takes away my life from me.

1251
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:50,666
I've been dying each and every moment..

1252
01:43:51,166 --> 01:43:57,000
..after separating from you. Please don't go away from me.

1253
01:43:57,500 --> 01:43:59,750
Never go away from me.

1254
01:44:00,250 --> 01:44:03,583
I accepted that I should enact as Meenu and..

1255
01:44:04,083 --> 01:44:08,583
..give Vijay a new life, but I couldn't tolerate when he..

1256
01:44:09,083 --> 01:44:15,750
..embraced me tightly.. Ravi, please..

1257
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:19,916
When he touched me, I felt as though somebody is pricking..

1258
01:44:20,416 --> 01:44:23,750
..me with thousands of glass pieces and shattered my..

1259
01:44:24,250 --> 01:44:32,416
..purity, my soul, and my love into pieces.

1260
01:44:32,916 --> 01:44:36,416
Ravi, don't be so harsh. Tell everything to Vijay clearly.

1261
01:44:42,666 --> 01:44:48,416
I just can't do this ..

1262
01:44:48,916 --> 01:44:50,333
..otherwise I would've died long back..

1263
01:44:50,833 --> 01:44:54,166
..when I saw you in his arms..

1264
01:44:54,666 --> 01:44:57,083
But I have to give a new life to Vijay.

1265
01:44:57,583 --> 01:45:04,666
Ravi, but.. But I..

1266
01:45:05,166 --> 01:45:10,416
You are my soul, you are my heartbeat and my life.

1267
01:45:10,916 --> 01:45:15,333
Meena, I don't exist without you.

1268
01:45:15,833 --> 01:45:23,916
Just support me this time. My friend will be saved.

1269
01:45:24,416 --> 01:45:26,500
Even if you don't give me happiness for the rest of my life..

1270
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:30,500
..still I will lead my life with a smile.

1271
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:37,750
Ravi.

1272
01:45:49,166 --> 01:45:52,916
Hey, what are you doing! - Were you praying for Vijay?

1273
01:45:53,416 --> 01:45:54,583
So she is the mother of that poisonous snake?

1274
01:45:55,083 --> 01:45:57,250
Who are you all? What are you doing? - Hey, you..

1275
01:45:57,750 --> 01:46:01,416
Aren't you ashamed? - You are trying to act smart.

1276
01:46:01,916 --> 01:46:05,416
What nonsense is this! - Now your prayers too can't save him

1277
01:46:13,583 --> 01:46:16,333
Hey, you! Why are you teasing a woman?

1278
01:46:16,833 --> 01:46:18,916
You are teasing a woman who is of your mother's age?

1279
01:46:19,416 --> 01:46:22,916
If you are true men, then come and tease me. Come.

1280
01:46:59,583 --> 01:47:02,750
Hey, come on, run for your life! Come on! - Run! - Run!

1281
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:05,416
Hey, you! Trying to act smart here? You goon!

1282
01:47:05,916 --> 01:47:09,166
Goons? If they are goons, then who are you?

1283
01:47:09,666 --> 01:47:10,916
Even you are a goon. - Actually, sister-in-law..

1284
01:47:11,416 --> 01:47:12,500
Don't you dare call me sister-in-law.

1285
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,833
We don't have any relationship with you now.

1286
01:47:15,333 --> 01:47:17,583
By trying to save Vijay and me, don't think..

1287
01:47:18,083 --> 01:47:19,500
..you can come close to us. - Sister-in-law, don't punish..

1288
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,666
..me so severely. Don't punish me so severely, sister-in-law.

1289
01:47:23,166 --> 01:47:27,000
I can't forget that day when police targeted you.

1290
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:31,500
To save your life, my husband got shot.

1291
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,666
You made me a widow and my son an orphan.

1292
01:47:36,166 --> 01:47:39,333
Sister-in-law, please don't make such an accusation on me.

1293
01:47:39,833 --> 01:47:41,833
If helping the poor get justice is rowdyism..

1294
01:47:42,333 --> 01:47:43,916
..then every person in this world.

1295
01:47:44,416 --> 01:47:46,833
..who fights against the crime is a goon.

1296
01:47:47,333 --> 01:47:49,333
I warned brother many times not come between the owner..

1297
01:47:49,833 --> 01:47:52,083
..and the policemen, but brother didn't listen to me..

1298
01:47:52,583 --> 01:47:54,000
..at all and believed those people..

1299
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:56,333
..and finally those people.. - It is a lie.

1300
01:47:56,833 --> 01:47:57,750
Whatever you are saying is lies.

1301
01:47:58,250 --> 01:48:00,666
My husband was punished for your deeds.

1302
01:48:01,166 --> 01:48:02,750
You have already snatched away my husband from me..

1303
01:48:03,250 --> 01:48:05,166
Now do you want to snatch my son too?

1304
01:48:05,666 --> 01:48:09,166
Go away, get lost from here. Go away.

1305
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:28,166
Jai, try to focus on your career.

1306
01:48:28,666 --> 01:48:31,250
Listen to me and get a job somewhere.

1307
01:48:31,750 --> 01:48:33,916
My dear brother, don't mess up with these rich people..

1308
01:48:34,416 --> 01:48:37,750
..and try to help the poor people and waste your time.

1309
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:42,333
Brother, I can't tolerate poor people being humiliated.

1310
01:48:42,833 --> 01:48:44,000
By the way, this hunger, unemployment..

1311
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:45,916
..and poverty is because of these rich people only.

1312
01:48:46,416 --> 01:48:48,333
Enough, sister-in-law.

1313
01:48:48,833 --> 01:48:52,000
Jai, my brother, don't show so much concern for the people.

1314
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:53,666
..in this world, if you create any problem, then police..

1315
01:48:54,166 --> 01:48:58,500
..will trouble you unnecessarily

1316
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,833
Jai Kishan, you have trashed Mr. Babu and he is admitted..

1317
01:49:01,333 --> 01:49:03,583
..in the hospital now. So I've come to arrest you for that crime.

1318
01:49:04,083 --> 01:49:05,916
I have not committed any crime, inspector.

1319
01:49:06,416 --> 01:49:08,500
Mr. Babu had cut off the water supply and electricity in..

1320
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,083
..colony of the poor people, so that they vacate the place..

1321
01:49:10,583 --> 01:49:12,083
..and Mr. Babu could built a casino on that site.

1322
01:49:12,583 --> 01:49:16,166
That is the reason I've just warned him.

1323
01:49:16,666 --> 01:49:20,833
Jai, but that site belongs to Mr. Babu and you hit Mr. Babu..

1324
01:49:21,333 --> 01:49:23,750
Anyways, I'll handle it.

1325
01:49:24,250 --> 01:49:26,916
You surrender yourself to the police, I'm your elder brother..

1326
01:49:27,416 --> 01:49:29,083
..I'll make arrangements for the bail.

1327
01:49:29,583 --> 01:49:32,000
Mr. Prem Kishan, I've brought a non-bailable warrant.

1328
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:34,583
Jai wait! - If you try to run then I'll shoot you.

1329
01:49:35,083 --> 01:49:37,750
No, inspector, don't do like this. I'm his elder brother..

1330
01:49:38,250 --> 01:49:39,833
..I'll make him understand. Jai, don't do like this.

1331
01:49:40,333 --> 01:49:41,083
Brother, you don't come in between me and..

1332
01:49:41,583 --> 01:49:42,333
..these policemen sent by that rich man.

1333
01:49:42,833 --> 01:49:45,166
Jai Kishan, Stop! - Jai!

1334
01:49:45,666 --> 01:49:51,333
Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother!

1335
01:49:51,833 --> 01:49:55,333
Jai, Jai.. - No!

1336
01:51:05,333 --> 01:51:08,333
Welcome, Jai Kishan.

1337
01:51:08,833 --> 01:51:11,916
How strange, brother! Why you had to call me here?

1338
01:51:12,416 --> 01:51:13,833
You would've directly come to my farmhouse.

1339
01:51:14,333 --> 01:51:17,000
If necessary, I'll come there too. - What is the matter?

1340
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:20,166
Make your nephew and your boys understand that ..

1341
01:51:20,666 --> 01:51:24,500
..if they trouble Vijay and his mother again..

1342
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:26,166
..then I'll come to your farmhouse..

1343
01:51:26,666 --> 01:51:28,166
..and in front of you I'll kill all of them.

1344
01:51:28,666 --> 01:51:31,083
Hey! Do you know, whom are you talking to? - Get lost!

1345
01:51:31,583 --> 01:51:34,583
Chhote, stop! You do not interfere.

1346
01:51:35,083 --> 01:51:38,583
Jai Kishan! How are you related to those people..

1347
01:51:39,083 --> 01:51:41,250
..that you are getting so angry?

1348
01:51:41,750 --> 01:51:44,500
It is obvious that somebody will get angry for their own people.

1349
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:48,000
That is my house. Even a small sparrow fights the snake..

1350
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:54,166
..to save her nest. To tell this only, I had called you here.

1351
01:51:54,666 --> 01:51:58,166
I hope by now you would've understood what I said.

1352
01:52:10,833 --> 01:52:13,416
Big brother, why did you let this scoundrel go from here?

1353
01:52:13,916 --> 01:52:16,583
You would've killed him here itself.

1354
01:52:17,083 --> 01:52:20,833
Chhote, he loves his family members very much..

1355
01:52:21,333 --> 01:52:24,166
We will burry all of them at once.

1356
01:52:24,666 --> 01:52:26,416
What's the big deal if I don't celebrate my birthday this year?

1357
01:52:26,916 --> 01:52:28,583
What difference would it make. - It would make a great difference!

1358
01:52:29,083 --> 01:52:30,666
As your stage group people..

1359
01:52:31,166 --> 01:52:32,833
..are throwing a party this year. Hey, they have..

1360
01:52:33,333 --> 01:52:33,833
..organized this party with so much love and..

1361
01:52:34,333 --> 01:52:35,250
..you don't want to celebrate your birthday?

1362
01:52:35,750 --> 01:52:37,083
Just because Meena is not here, is that the reason?

1363
01:52:37,583 --> 01:52:39,500
Buddy, actually the thing is.. - I don't want any excuses now..

1364
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,333
I've already promised them that you are coming to the..

1365
01:52:42,833 --> 01:52:43,583
..party and I've even invited Meenu there.

1366
01:52:44,083 --> 01:52:45,166
Vijay, please listen to me, actually..

1367
01:52:45,666 --> 01:52:49,166
You are going to come to the party, okay?

1368
01:53:25,750 --> 01:53:27,916
What is this? - Guitar.

1369
01:53:28,416 --> 01:53:31,666
No, buddy, today I am not going to sing.

1370
01:53:32,166 --> 01:53:34,833
Did you hear that, Meenu? When you were in London..

1371
01:53:35,333 --> 01:53:38,166
..he used to give me lectures about love and life..

1372
01:53:38,666 --> 01:53:41,833
..and today when his Meena isn't here, he isn't even ready..

1373
01:53:42,333 --> 01:53:46,583
..to sing a song. He is least bothered about us.

1374
01:53:47,083 --> 01:53:50,666
You make him understand. - The Meena whom you love..

1375
01:53:51,166 --> 01:53:54,666
..so much, how can she go away from you?

1376
01:54:27,166 --> 01:54:32,083
"From where should I get the words?"

1377
01:54:32,583 --> 01:54:37,333
"Which would explain what's in my heart."

1378
01:54:37,833 --> 01:54:42,583
"From where should I get the words?"

1379
01:54:43,083 --> 01:54:47,750
"Which would explain what's in my heart."

1380
01:54:48,250 --> 01:54:53,000
"I pray for you, my dear."

1381
01:54:53,500 --> 01:54:58,583
"Let all your dreams come true."

1382
01:54:59,083 --> 01:55:02,583
"May you touch the sky one day!"

1383
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:14,916
"From where should I get the words?"

1384
01:55:15,416 --> 01:55:20,000
"Which would explain what's in my heart."

1385
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:25,000
"I pray for you, my dear."

1386
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:30,666
"Let all your dreams come true."

1387
01:55:31,166 --> 01:55:34,666
"May you touch the sky one day!"

1388
01:55:57,333 --> 01:56:02,250
"This world is like a play."

1389
01:56:02,750 --> 01:56:06,250
"There's hope at one point and only pain at the other."

1390
01:56:13,416 --> 01:56:18,250
"This world is like a play."

1391
01:56:18,750 --> 01:56:23,500
"There's hope at one point and only pain at the other."

1392
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:29,000
"My dear, may you always be happy!"

1393
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:35,083
"Let all the pain come in my share."

1394
01:56:35,583 --> 01:56:40,500
"From where should I get the words?"

1395
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:45,750
"Which would explain what's in my heart."

1396
01:56:46,250 --> 01:56:50,833
"My story is very short."

1397
01:56:51,333 --> 01:56:56,500
"I am so much in love with you."

1398
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:00,500
"That I'll do whatever you tell me to do."

1399
01:57:36,416 --> 01:57:41,333
"The one who does not understand pain."

1400
01:57:41,833 --> 01:57:45,333
"Whatever you tell him, it is not love."

1401
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:57,416
"The one who does not understand pain."

1402
01:57:57,916 --> 01:58:02,833
"Whatever you tell him, it is not love."

1403
01:58:03,333 --> 01:58:08,166
"If my beloved asks me for my life."

1404
01:58:08,666 --> 01:58:14,000
"I'd gladly die, he just has to ask once."

1405
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:19,666
"From where should I get the words?"

1406
01:58:20,166 --> 01:58:24,916
"Which would explain what's in my heart."

1407
01:58:25,416 --> 01:58:30,500
"From where should I get the words?"

1408
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:35,500
"Which would explain what's in my heart."

1409
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:40,666
"How lucky I am!"

1410
01:58:41,166 --> 01:58:46,500
"I got such a beautiful beloved."

1411
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:50,500
"And such a sincere friend."

1412
01:58:57,583 --> 01:59:02,583
"From where should I get the words?"

1413
01:59:03,083 --> 01:59:07,583
"Which would explain what's in my heart."

1414
01:59:08,083 --> 01:59:12,750
"I pray for you, my dear."

1415
01:59:13,250 --> 01:59:18,416
"Let all your dreams come true."

1416
01:59:18,916 --> 01:59:22,416
"May you touch the sky one day!"

1417
02:00:03,833 --> 02:00:07,166
Meenu! How strange, it is such a romantic season..

1418
02:00:07,666 --> 02:00:12,000
..and you are swimming here alone without me?

1419
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:13,833
Come, let's go out somewhere.

1420
02:00:14,333 --> 02:00:16,500
Vijay, actually.. - Meenu, nothing doing!

1421
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:20,750
We have very less time. Come on, let's go.

1422
02:00:21,250 --> 02:00:23,166
I didn't understand. - Look, Meenu, in this season..

1423
02:00:23,666 --> 02:00:26,083
..I feel like taking you for a long drive.

1424
02:00:26,583 --> 02:00:28,500
I can't come. - Hey, Meenu, you will never get..

1425
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,416
..a season like this and an opportunity like this.

1426
02:00:31,916 --> 02:00:34,833
If you say 'no', then I'll not talk to you again.

1427
02:00:35,333 --> 02:00:37,416
Hey, Meenu, you always used to be so romantic.

1428
02:00:37,916 --> 02:00:39,583
All of a sudden what went wrong with you?

1429
02:00:40,083 --> 02:00:41,500
Hey, come on, Meenu. - Vijay! - Come on.

1430
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:43,250
Vijay, listen to me. - Come on. - Vijay, leave me.

1431
02:00:43,750 --> 02:00:44,833
Now, go and change fast. - Vijay, I can't come with you.

1432
02:00:45,333 --> 02:00:48,750
We'll go on a long drive, okay? - Please.

1433
02:00:49,250 --> 02:00:52,750
Meenu, oh no! Why it had to rain now?

1434
02:00:58,083 --> 02:00:59,666
Hey, Meenu, I think you will fall sick this way.

1435
02:01:00,166 --> 02:01:02,416
Come on, get down fast, nearby there is a ruin, we'll go..

1436
02:01:02,916 --> 02:01:04,500
..and hide ourselves there. Come, make if fast. Come on, fast.

1437
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:08,500
Carefully. Carefully.

1438
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:28,166
Hey, you are shivering because of cold.

1439
02:01:28,666 --> 02:01:30,166
There is a towel in that bag, remove your wet clothes..

1440
02:01:30,666 --> 02:01:34,416
..and wrap that towel around you, by that time..

1441
02:01:34,916 --> 02:01:41,833
..I'll search for wood for fire. - No, it is okay, I am fine.

1442
02:01:42,333 --> 02:01:46,500
I am comfortable this way. - This rain is not going to stop.

1443
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:50,500
You might suffer pneumonia in these wet clothes.

1444
02:01:57,916 --> 02:02:01,416
I wouldn't like my love to fall sick.

1445
02:02:06,666 --> 02:02:11,833
Take this. - No, I feel shy.

1446
02:02:12,333 --> 02:02:14,916
Why do you have to feel shy from me?

1447
02:02:15,416 --> 02:02:18,500
Once you said that I am in your soul.

1448
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:24,583
If I can see your soul, then this body is nothing but a statue..

1449
02:02:25,083 --> 02:02:30,166
..made of mud. Why do you have to feel shy?

1450
02:02:30,666 --> 02:02:34,166
Take this and wear it.

1451
02:02:39,583 --> 02:02:45,416
Look, you are catching cold.

1452
02:02:45,916 --> 02:02:53,666
Meenu, if something happens to you, then I'll die.

1453
02:02:54,166 --> 02:02:57,666
I know that you love me very much.

1454
02:03:03,416 --> 02:03:06,916
Take this and wear it. I'll go and find some wood.

1455
02:03:34,083 --> 02:03:37,583
I think there is a thunderstorm outside.

1456
02:03:45,250 --> 02:03:51,833
Your beauty and this climate are making me go mad.

1457
02:03:52,333 --> 02:03:56,583
What happened to you, all of a sudden?

1458
02:03:57,083 --> 02:03:58,500
What are you talking?

1459
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:02,416
Meenu,

1460
02:04:02,916 --> 02:04:08,666
..you are fire. I want to burn myself in this.

1461
02:04:09,166 --> 02:04:10,750
What kind of madness is this! Leave me.

1462
02:04:11,250 --> 02:04:15,083
Meenu, this is not madness, this is love. - Leave me!

1463
02:04:15,583 --> 02:04:17,250
No, Meenu, please don't stop me today, Meenu.

1464
02:04:17,750 --> 02:04:19,916
Come, let's become one today. - Vijay!

1465
02:04:20,416 --> 02:04:20,833
Ravi! - Look, Meena, I..

1466
02:04:21,333 --> 02:04:23,750
Don't give me any explanation.

1467
02:04:24,250 --> 02:04:27,333
Actually the matter is that your friend has made you selfish.

1468
02:04:27,833 --> 02:04:30,083
The game that your are playing for your friendship..

1469
02:04:30,583 --> 02:04:32,750
..I won't support you in this game now.

1470
02:04:33,250 --> 02:04:38,000
I'll never tolerate that someone other than you embraces me.

1471
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:39,333
Someone other than you..

1472
02:04:39,833 --> 02:04:41,750
..plays with my hair and praises my beauty.

1473
02:04:42,250 --> 02:04:44,583
I cannot tolerate this.

1474
02:04:45,083 --> 02:04:49,000
Neither will I fool myself and nor will I let Vijay become a fool.

1475
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:52,166
I am yours, only yours!

1476
02:04:52,666 --> 02:04:55,166
If you can become selfish for your friend..

1477
02:04:55,666 --> 02:04:59,416
..then even I can become selfish for my love.

1478
02:04:59,916 --> 02:05:06,500
From now onwards it won't be my examination, but it will be yours.

1479
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,500
Let me see if you respect your love in front of your..

1480
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:13,500
..friendship or betray it in front of people.

1481
02:05:22,333 --> 02:05:24,916
Where are you going with the spoon? Is the food ready?

1482
02:05:25,416 --> 02:05:26,333
The guest will be here in no time..

1483
02:05:26,833 --> 02:05:28,333
..and you are roaming around with a spoon in your hand.

1484
02:05:28,833 --> 02:05:30,833
Sir, everything is ready, except for the sweets.

1485
02:05:31,333 --> 02:05:32,000
It will be ready in a short while.

1486
02:05:32,500 --> 02:05:33,750
The sweets aren't ready yet? Will you prepare the sweet..

1487
02:05:34,250 --> 02:05:35,250
..after the guests have come? Go immediately and..

1488
02:05:35,750 --> 02:05:38,166
..prepare the sweets. Make it fast!

1489
02:05:38,666 --> 02:05:40,500
Dad, what is going on! What are you preparing for?

1490
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:42,500
Is somebody coming here, today? - Ghanshyam is coming here today.

1491
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:44,916
Meena has gone to the airport to receive him.

1492
02:05:45,416 --> 02:05:47,833
And these people haven't prepared the sweets yet.

1493
02:05:48,333 --> 02:05:51,750
Meena? - Yes, Meena went to the airport to receive him.

1494
02:05:52,250 --> 02:05:53,083
When did you meet, Meena?

1495
02:05:53,583 --> 02:05:58,000
Just now I told Meena to go and get her father.

1496
02:05:58,500 --> 02:06:01,333
Now why are you roaming here and there? Sweets..

1497
02:06:01,833 --> 02:06:05,333
Son, I'll be right back. Hey, you, spoon..

1498
02:06:09,833 --> 02:06:12,166
Hey, we were thinking that we lost the opportunity of looting..

1499
02:06:12,666 --> 02:06:16,916
..Ghanshyam's property, but 'no'.

1500
02:06:17,416 --> 02:06:19,333
Now we've got the opportunity.

1501
02:06:19,833 --> 02:06:21,833
It doesn't matter even if someone is killed, because living and..

1502
02:06:22,333 --> 02:06:26,333
..dying is a part of life. If we are worried about something..

1503
02:06:26,833 --> 02:06:28,666
..it is about Ghanshyam's property which you'll get..

1504
02:06:29,166 --> 02:06:32,583
..after becoming his son-in-law.

1505
02:06:33,083 --> 02:06:37,500
There is only one way left.

1506
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,250
Where are you taking me to? Who are you?

1507
02:06:40,750 --> 02:06:44,250
Just sit quietly. - Which place is this?

1508
02:06:50,416 --> 02:06:53,916
Take her away from here and lock her up in a room.

1509
02:07:07,750 --> 02:07:10,750
Nephew, you've got your Meena, now it is necessary..

1510
02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:14,333
..to get the property papers from Ravi Kumar.

1511
02:07:14,833 --> 02:07:16,750
Brother, if you order me, I'll get him right away.

1512
02:07:17,250 --> 02:07:19,250
Uncle, it is not necessary.

1513
02:07:19,750 --> 02:07:23,250
I'll call him up in such a way that he will come here running.

1514
02:07:23,750 --> 02:07:26,416
Ravi! Hey, uncle, where is Ravi?

1515
02:07:26,916 --> 02:07:28,916
Sir, Mr. Ravi has gone out. - Oh no!

1516
02:07:29,416 --> 02:07:30,583
When he returns tell him that I had come here.

1517
02:07:31,083 --> 02:07:34,583
Okay, sir.

1518
02:07:36,416 --> 02:07:36,916
Hello!

1519
02:07:37,416 --> 02:07:39,000
Ravi Kumar. - Who?

1520
02:07:39,500 --> 02:07:42,833
It is strange that you don't recognize your enemy's voice?

1521
02:07:43,333 --> 02:07:46,333
Mr. Ravi, I am Monty speaking. Monty. - Tell me.

1522
02:07:46,833 --> 02:07:50,500
Ravi, forgive me, but I've committed a small mistake.

1523
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:57,250
I've kidnapped Meena. In return I want her property papers..

1524
02:07:57,750 --> 02:07:59,500
..and those papers are with you.

1525
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:03,583
Now it belongs to me. One more thing, don't do a..

1526
02:08:04,083 --> 02:08:05,666
..mistake again of not coming here.

1527
02:08:06,166 --> 02:08:08,500
Because of your first mistake unknowingly your friend..

1528
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:14,250
..Vijay's girlfriend Meenu got killed.

1529
02:08:14,750 --> 02:08:16,583
Mr. Ravi, death is very strange thing.

1530
02:08:17,083 --> 02:08:20,750
Just imagine, poor Meenu was going back to London..

1531
02:08:21,250 --> 02:08:24,750
I don't know with what excuse death sent her to us.

1532
02:08:33,666 --> 02:08:36,333
Hey, Vijay! When did you come here, my friend?

1533
02:08:36,833 --> 02:08:42,750
Ravi, why did you hide the matter of Meenu's death from me?

1534
02:08:43,250 --> 02:08:45,083
Ravi, why did you hide the matter of Meenu's death from me?

1535
02:08:45,583 --> 02:08:48,166
Give me an answer! Why did you hide such..

1536
02:08:48,666 --> 02:08:53,333
..a big secret of my life? Answer my question, Ravi.

1537
02:08:53,833 --> 02:08:55,000
Give me an answer!

1538
02:08:55,500 --> 02:08:57,333
Vijay, actually I thought I would tell you..

1539
02:08:57,833 --> 02:09:01,666
When would you had told me that? After you've ruined your life?

1540
02:09:02,166 --> 02:09:04,500
Ravi, I would've known the truth one or other day..

1541
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,666
..that my Meenu, is no more, then?

1542
02:09:08,166 --> 02:09:09,166
Vijay.. - Ravi, don't give me explanation.

1543
02:09:09,666 --> 02:09:13,166
Don't give me explanation.

1544
02:09:13,666 --> 02:09:17,500
I was thinking your Meena as my Meenu.

1545
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:19,416
The one whom I had to respect as a sister..

1546
02:09:19,916 --> 02:09:25,500
..as a sister-in-law, I was thinking of her as.

1547
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,666
You didn't say anything?

1548
02:09:29,166 --> 02:09:32,583
Why did you do that, Ravi? Why?

1549
02:09:33,083 --> 02:09:35,916
My brother, why did you let me commit such a big crime?

1550
02:09:36,416 --> 02:09:39,416
Why? - What would've you done if you were in my place?

1551
02:09:39,916 --> 02:09:41,583
Would you have stood and seen me getting ruined?

1552
02:09:42,083 --> 02:09:44,583
Would you have let me die?

1553
02:09:45,083 --> 02:09:49,666
You wouldn't have let that happen, my friend, so did I.

1554
02:09:50,166 --> 02:09:55,583
My love was very small in front of your life and mother's love.

1555
02:09:56,083 --> 02:09:58,583
How will I face Meena now?

1556
02:09:59,083 --> 02:10:02,083
Ravi, by hiding this secret, you've already hurt Meena a lot..

1557
02:10:02,583 --> 02:10:07,500
..but you've even given a chance for those scoundrels..

1558
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:11,083
..to live who has killed my Meenu.

1559
02:10:11,583 --> 02:10:15,583
Ravi, Monty has committed a big mistake by killing Meenu.

1560
02:10:16,083 --> 02:10:19,416
Today I am going to finish those scoundrels.

1561
02:10:19,916 --> 02:10:22,333
Ravi, Meenu is no more now, but I won't let this happen..

1562
02:10:22,833 --> 02:10:31,250
..with Meena. No! - Meena?

1563
02:10:31,750 --> 02:10:35,500
Start playing now.

1564
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,166
Brother Jai Kishan, I stay in the same colony..

1565
02:10:38,666 --> 02:10:40,916
..and I work in Mr. Vijay's friend Mr. Ravi Kumar's house.

1566
02:10:41,416 --> 02:10:43,583
Mr. Rana has kidnapped Ravi Kumar's girlfriend Meena.

1567
02:10:44,083 --> 02:10:45,583
And Vijay has gone there to kill them.

1568
02:10:46,083 --> 02:10:48,916
In spite of warning Rana, he has caused trouble to Vijay.

1569
02:10:49,416 --> 02:10:50,416
We all are with you, brother. - No, no.

1570
02:10:50,916 --> 02:10:54,083
This is my personal fight. That is the reason I'll go there alone.

1571
02:10:54,583 --> 02:10:58,083
You scoundrel!

1572
02:11:01,500 --> 02:11:05,000
Leave me!

1573
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:10,500
Vijay has.. - Nothing will happen to our Vijay, sister-in-law.

1574
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:14,500
I promise you that.

1575
02:11:39,416 --> 02:11:42,166
Leave me, you scoundrel, leave me!

1576
02:11:42,666 --> 02:11:46,083
Help! Leave me!

1577
02:11:46,583 --> 02:11:51,250
Help! Help! Open the door! Is anybody there?

1578
02:11:51,750 --> 02:11:55,250
Open the door!

1579
02:12:07,375 --> 02:12:10,875
You scoundrel, leave me! Leave me! Leave!

1580
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,500
Welcome, Vijay! Welcome! Why hasn't your friend Ravi..

1581
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,250
..come along with you?

1582
02:12:58,750 --> 02:13:06,083
Rana! Whenever I tried killing somebody Ravi had stopped me.

1583
02:13:06,583 --> 02:13:08,083
Rana, today Ravi is not present here.

1584
02:13:08,583 --> 02:13:09,833
Who will save you from me?

1585
02:13:10,333 --> 02:13:12,166
I think you are short-sighted.

1586
02:13:12,666 --> 02:13:16,833
Rana, I can only see Meenu's murderers all around me.

1587
02:13:17,333 --> 02:13:21,000
Rana, before you die, tell me one thing, where is Monty?

1588
02:13:21,500 --> 02:13:25,750
I'll tell you, but after you die. - You scoundrel!

1589
02:13:26,250 --> 02:13:27,500
Hey, how dare you hit my brother?

1590
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:31,500
How dare you hit my brother? - Take him away.

1591
02:13:54,666 --> 02:13:57,916
Ravi! Don't leave him!

1592
02:13:58,416 --> 02:14:01,916
He is Meenu's murderer. Don't leave him! Hit him!

1593
02:14:55,333 --> 02:14:59,666
Rana! I think you've forgotten the fear of your death..

1594
02:15:00,166 --> 02:15:01,750
..that in spite mine of warning you, you dared to..

1595
02:15:02,250 --> 02:15:06,000
..trouble my family members.

1596
02:15:06,500 --> 02:15:10,250
Rana! You'll be diminished! Nobody will talk about you.

1597
02:15:10,750 --> 02:15:16,000
Jai Kishan! This is a graveyard for my enemies.

1598
02:15:16,500 --> 02:15:20,833
You've come here, but you can't go back alive from here.

1599
02:15:21,333 --> 02:15:24,833
I'll burry you all alive here!

1600
02:16:33,166 --> 02:16:36,666
Hey! Leave him!

1601
02:17:44,375 --> 02:17:47,875
You scoundrel!

1602
02:18:14,833 --> 02:18:21,416
Vijay, he is Meenu's murderer.

1603
02:18:21,916 --> 02:18:25,416
Vijay, hit him!

1604
02:18:43,416 --> 02:18:45,583
Hey! Hands up!

1605
02:18:46,083 --> 02:18:49,000
Stop or else I'll shoot you!

1606
02:18:49,500 --> 02:18:54,333
Uncle, shoot them! Shoot them!

1607
02:18:54,833 --> 02:18:57,000
Don't leave them, kill them!

1608
02:18:57,500 --> 02:19:00,416
Shoot them!

1609
02:19:00,916 --> 02:19:05,833
Come this way! Come.

1610
02:19:06,333 --> 02:19:09,833
Shoot! Shoot!

1611
02:19:50,666 --> 02:20:00,750
Jai Kishan, what have you done? What have you done?

1612
02:20:01,250 --> 02:20:05,000
You gave your life to calm me down.

1613
02:20:05,500 --> 02:20:09,166
No, sister-in-law, I haven't given my life.

1614
02:20:09,666 --> 02:20:17,333
Today I have got life. I couldn't tolerate your anger till now.

1615
02:20:17,833 --> 02:20:20,416
Sister-in-law, I had almost lost hope of living.

1616
02:20:20,916 --> 02:20:24,583
I used to die everyday. You.. - Jai. - Brother Jai.

1617
02:20:25,083 --> 02:20:27,750
You are not only my sister-in-law, but you were my mother as well.

1618
02:20:28,250 --> 02:20:31,583
Yes, son, yes. I am your mother.

1619
02:20:32,083 --> 02:20:36,208
I am your mother, but don't sacrifice your life.

1620
02:20:36,708 --> 02:20:38,166
Son, please don't leave me.

1621
02:20:38,666 --> 02:20:40,250
Please don't leave me.

1622
02:20:40,750 --> 02:20:45,500
Hey, Vijay, you look just like my brother.

1623
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:49,583
You look just like my brother.

1624
02:20:50,083 --> 02:20:53,583
Jai! - Jai!

1625
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:06,833
"The lovers are meeting today."

1626
02:21:07,333 --> 02:21:13,166
"The clouds are overcast and flowers are blooming."

1627
02:21:13,666 --> 02:21:19,583
"The heart is very peaceful."

1628
02:21:20,083 --> 02:21:23,583
"It has found its destination."

1629
02:21:39,083 --> 02:21:44,833
"My life is singing."

1630
02:21:45,333 --> 02:21:51,500
"Now that I have become your companion."

1631
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:57,750
"The heart is very peaceful."

1632
02:21:58,250 --> 02:22:01,750
"It has found its destination."

1633
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:54,833
"Where have we come walking? Where?"

1634
02:22:55,333 --> 02:23:01,166
"There's aroma everywhere. Everywhere."

1635
02:23:01,666 --> 02:23:07,583
"The soft breeze is like flowing stream of music."

1636
02:23:08,083 --> 02:23:14,083
"All the sights are beautiful, but you are the most beautiful."

1637
02:23:14,583 --> 02:23:20,000
"We both are lost in love."

1638
02:23:20,500 --> 02:23:26,500
"Like lost butterfly in a garden."

1639
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:32,916
"The heart is very peaceful."

1640
02:23:33,416 --> 02:23:39,541
"It has found its destination."
