1
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,539
Sir, please give me arms!

2
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:21,211
You're maintaining body very slim,
six pack like Sunil?

3
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,979
No money even for a cigarette pack,
how can I have a six pack, sir?

4
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:29,052
Take this money and turn your
six pack into family pack.

5
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,778
Eat on time, got it?

6
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:35,723
Do we watches to eat on time, sir?
- You're right.

7
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,859
You're a great benefactor?
ls your name Dharmaraju?

8
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:45,692
Neither I'm Dharmaraju nor 'Di
' Raju,
I'm Buchi Raju.

9
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,016
What do you want sir?
- I want a car for dropping.

10
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,748
Which car you want, sir
- Costliest car!

11
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,416
We don't have that company car, sir.

12
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:14,224
Did you get it like that, I meant
which is the costliest car here.

13
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,432
That's perfect for my range.

14
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,901
I want the costliest room
in your hotel.

15
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,340
Then, take President suite.

16
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,276
I don't want President's pant
or Prime Minister's shirt,

17
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,416
I want the costliest room.

18
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,643
Sachin stayed in this room
for IPL matches.

19
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,219
ls this already used room?
What's your name?

20
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,112
APP". here's your tip.

21
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,793
This tip will settle all my loans, sir.

22
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,476
I'll get on to the real work.

23
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:11,919
What word should I use?

24
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:18,125
Suicide note!

25
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:23,294
If you're born in this world, either
you should be Ambani or Amitabh's son.

26
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:24,826
I don't have that chance.

27
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,835
If many commit suicide for
the diseases,

28
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,167
I'm committing suicide for
not having money.

29
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:34,209
Don't send my body to mortuary,
I hate that smell.

30
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:38,179
Courier it to my uncle
Abracadabra Appa Rao's address.

31
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:42,081
Please note: Uncle, I'm dying
for the first time in life,

32
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,619
don't be stingy in
conducting my funeral,

33
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:47,656
don't worry about cost,
make it a grand affair,

34
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,487
use sandalwood to cremate me,

35
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:52,152
yours... I'm going away!

36
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:56,529
Oh no! My death is nearing.

37
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,765
If I die in bad time,
I'll roam here as ghost.

38
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,529
I'm scared of ghosts.

39
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,434
Buchi, your life ends here.

40
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:16,650
It's sour!
How do people drink it to die?

41
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,215
If I add sugar,
I can drink it easily to die.

42
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,146
Stomach ache!

43
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:48,578
Why should I've this
disturbance when I'm dying?

44
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:00,823
Door is open!

45
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,969
Our bad time, did he find
our hotel to die?

46
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:18,080
What can we do?

47
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,214
Treatment is on inside,
please pay the bill.

48
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,614
Forget about your hospital bill,
who will pay my hotel bill?

49
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,378
This is the house.

50
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,654
What's this? No please...

51
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,923
You're too much!

52
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,965
What's this? No please...

53
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:38,966
You're too much!

54
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,627
Who's he?
Running a show early morning.

55
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:45,970
This is not that show
but my calling bell tune.

56
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:51,072
Don't imagine too much,
open the door and get in.

57
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,721
Got scared?

58
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:08,163
Don't forget you've come
to a magician's house.

59
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,700
If you want to see head,
turn your head and see.

60
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:16,665
What's this myth?

61
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:33,585
Got anxious?

62
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:39,658
I created many magical tricks
like to upstage P C Sorcar.

63
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:42,322
Are you here to book my program?

64
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:45,867
Where should I come and when?

65
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,164
You must come to Help Hospital.

66
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,328
ls the program in hospital?

67
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,566
Your nephew is there.
- What happened to him?

68
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:54,211
He tried to commit suicide for fun.

69
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,573
Suicide?
- Yes.

70
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,305
Our bad time!

71
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,919
How is Buchi?
- Buchi? That drunkard Buchi.

72
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:07,114
No need to worry about him.

73
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:12,787
But since he drank too much, it has
damaged his intestines and liver.

74
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,626
If his liver is damaged,
what about his treatment?

75
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:18,735
When we were treating for it,
suddenly his two kidneys failed.

76
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,168
I thought only in studies,
did his kidneys too fail?

77
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,935
He had paralysis after failing
both his kidneys.

78
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:28,408
My heart pains on hearing this.

79
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:34,041
Heart has two holes because
of extreme high and low BP.

80
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:38,416
You say about heart holes
like two patches on tyres.

81
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,081
It's not a big deal,
we'll patch it.

82
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,158
The real problem is
with respiration.

83
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,158
What happened to it?

84
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,319
Though ventilators are
pumping air inside

85
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,055
respiratory organs
are rejecting it.

86
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,564
Can't you tell him to breathe
in strongly?

87
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,565
We can but he must hear it, right?

88
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,567
You mean his ears too...

89
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,205
Lost it first.

90
00:09:57,396 --> 00:10:04,314
Patient is out of danger,
pay Rs.9,9999, we'll treat him further.

91
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,282
Which part is working in
his body to treat now?

92
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,079
That's why we're engaging specialists.

93
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:13,155
Till then, we'll use eye drops.
- I'll sell my house.

94
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,883
We keep recording temperature.
- I'll sell my farm.

95
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,118
Come Doctor, come here.

96
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,423
For safe side,
keep a box ready in mortuary.

97
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,589
Medical treatment is deadly!

98
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:32,141
Are you fine, Buchi?

99
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,642
You said he's almost dead.

100
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,474
My nephew is happily
eating apple here.

101
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,311
Didn't you ask about Buchi Babu
who had spurious drinks?

102
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,317
Asked about my nephew Buchi Raju.

103
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,650
Your nephew drank scent
to kill himself.

104
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:47,984
Did you drink scent bottle?

105
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,626
I went to super market and
asked for poison,

106
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,887
how would I know it's
the name of a scent?

107
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,956
What's this nonsense, Buchi?

108
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,000
Though you don't have anyone,
you've your maternal uncle, right?

109
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,501
That's why you pay the bill.

110
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:03,139
Not just this bill,
I can build a house for him,

111
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,332
I paid electric bill for him,

112
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,067
Forget about that
first pay this bill.

113
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,267
Go, I'll PaY-

114
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:12,178
Tell me how much is your bill?
Rs.3000 or 4000 or 2600?

115
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,512
Rs.145000 including hotel
and hospital bill.

116
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,182
Rs.1 lakh...
- Forty five thousands.

117
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:24,018
Did I tell the bed would get
booked on hearing the bill?

118
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,127
Your suicide almost killed me.
- Anyway why do you want to die?

119
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,096
I brought you here to tell that only.

120
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,862
Can't you remember flask back
unless you come here?

121
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:33,799
I'll not get the feel.

122
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,997
First scene of my love story
began here only.

123
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:41,873
Does your life lover story too,
I thought it had only comedy.

124
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,308
I too thought like that only,

125
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:47,076
but on seeing the girl,
lover boy in me woke up.

126
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,116
On that table only,

127
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:52,984
I was having 2 idlies with
third serving of sambar.

128
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,758
Why are you seeing that side?
- Heroine walked in from there only.

129
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,693
I've seen beautiful girls,
innocent girls,

130
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:06,131
I saw that day my wo
rd's most
beautiful and innocent girl!

131
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,068
Did you fall in love
with senior Sridevi?

132
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:39,594
Generally when I'm eating I don't
bother about anything else than food,

133
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,170
I became a statue seeing the girl.

134
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,714
Venkatesh and Aarthi Agarwa
's film?

135
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,952
1, 4 and 3!

136
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,618
I like you!

137
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,760
Film's name is I like you!

138
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,591
Yes, I like you!

139
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,602
Srikanth and Soundarya,
Nagarjuna special appearance?

140
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:18,401
I love you only!
- I love you only!

141
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:27,307
I'll marry only you.
- Yes, I'll marry only you.

142
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,078
Uday Kiran and Reema Sen...

143
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:34,553
You're in my heart!

144
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,793
You're in my heart...

145
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,523
You're in my heart...

146
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:46,034
Venkatesh and Soundarya...

147
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,466
Let's marry!

148
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,803
Let's marry!
- Yes, let's marry!

149
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,633
Marry happily,
you both are perfect couple!

150
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,746
Your love will also succeed like ours.

151
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,354
So senior lovers mistook you
forjunior lovers, right?

152
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,215
It's strange.

153
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,288
Second meeting was stranger.

154
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:08,481
Where did you meet her second time?

155
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:09,853
This park only.
- I expected this.

156
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,585
That's why you brought me
to this park, right?

157
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,754
My heroine was reading a magazine
sitting on that bench.

158
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:18,660
I entered munching groundnuts
listening to Pavan Ka
yan's song.

159
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,379
I thought young girl,
she's young mother!

160
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:44,419
ls it him?

161
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,856
Like father like son!

162
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,238
ls she really a mother?

163
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,009
Without bothering about crying child,
she's devouring magazine!

164
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,011
May her eyes go burst!

165
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,517
ls he father?

166
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,715
Without caring about crying child,
he's munching nuts!

167
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:17,883
May he be affected indigestion!

168
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,131
Baby is crying!

169
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:30,536
Fights and tiffs are common
for husband and wife.

170
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,735
Will you bring out the child
in chill weather for that?

171
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,607
Did you give birth to the child
or lifted it from somewhere?

172
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,406
The child is her...

173
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,480
She'll abuse as wife!

174
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:42,414
Won't we go home and cook and
look after wife and kids well?

175
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:43,211
What sort of husband are you?

176
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,686
That's not my child.
- Not mine too!

177
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,888
I'm not married at all.

178
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,794
As I'm married!

179
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,192
Did you go to play instead
of looking after the child?

180
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:54,330
My dear, don't cry...

181
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:55,931
Let's go, we've messed the scene.

182
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,401
Very good! Excellent!

183
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:08,111
So the society branded you as
man and wife in your second meeting.

184
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,611
Where did your love journey
actually begin?

185
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,305
In that bus!

186
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,396
If you remove your hand from rod,
I'll get down.

187
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,622
Why should I remove my hand
for you to get down?

188
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,629
Because this lamp rod is mine.

189
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,460
Thank God!

190
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,874
Excuse me, you owe me change.

191
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,947
I've to return Rs.30 to you, right?
- You owe me Rs.20.

192
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,658
I don't have change,
do one thing,

193
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,318
I'll give you Rs.50, share it.

194
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:00,327
How can I?

195
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,488
Get down please!

196
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:04,365
Let's get down.

197
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:11,937
Give it, I'll get change.
- Okay.

198
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,142
Do you know how they say
Rs.50 in Marathi?

199
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:18,144
I don't know.

200
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,214
Konkani language?
- I said I don't know. Go away!

201
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:26,420
Says doesn't know...
I mean no change.

202
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,648
H ow?

203
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,327
If we've coffee there,
they'll be forced to give change. Come.

204
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:39,401
It must be superb!

205
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:48,408
My name is Buchi Raju,
fondly people call me as Buchi!

206
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,015
What's your name?
- Why do you want my name?

207
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,548
Would I tell my name if you ask?

208
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,686
Would I tell my name is
Balabhad runipathruni Veeravenkata

209
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,914
Sivasathya Thulasiganga
Manikyamba Mahalakshmi?

210
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:05,589
Do you think I'll tell you
that my short name is Maha?

211
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,733
I'm 28 years old.

212
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,633
I think you may be around 26 years.

213
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,368
I'm quiet and you're daring
to ask a girl's age.

214
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,875
26?

215
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,540
My aunt's daughter Chinnari
turned 26 on August 15!

216
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,618
I'm 2 years younger than her.

217
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,113
Would I tell my age if you ask me?

218
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,785
I thought little old
but she's 24 only.

219
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,586
Age has matched perfectly.

220
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,729
I'm working as salesman
with Kalanikethan.

221
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:40,420
What about you?

222
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,566
Why do you want to know?
What would you do anyway?

223
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,292
Though I did MBA,
I'm presently doing nothing,

224
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,869
will you be able to make
give all the details?

225
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:49,562
Go to hell!

226
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:50,900
There's idli, poori and
vada too, madam.

227
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,872
ls it? Have it yourself, go!

228
00:18:56,902 --> 00:19:00,111
ls this coffee or kulfi?
It's disgusting.

229
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,383
Do you know to make good coffee?

230
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,249
It's like asking Sachin
if he can bat well?

231
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:11,122
Why should I tell you that my neighbours
form a queue for my coffee?

232
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,487
I've decided.
- What's that?

233
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,599
You don't need to pay me even a penny.

234
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,291
All my life!
- Why?

235
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,437
Just serve me a coffee with
your hands every day.

236
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:21,696
All my life!

237
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,367
Tell me clearly.

238
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:26,009
Would I tell lfell in love
with you at first sight?

239
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,337
Would I tell you that I've
decided to marry you now?

240
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,174
Nobody can make me say I love you.

241
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:55,871
It has started...
narrating long tales...

242
00:19:56,028 --> 00:20:00,909
A beautiful fight between
sweet pair of lips...

243
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:06,066
The tempo of the rhythm increased
the heart to speed like a chariot...

244
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:16,690
My heart's turmoil is more
furious than Bay of Bengal...

245
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:21,456
Would I let you know that?

246
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,794
Your action says
what your lips are denying...

247
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:10,211
If anyone asks me to compare you
with another beauty...

248
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:15,249
What else can I find difference
other than ear rings and bangles...

249
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:20,516
You've doused me with the
colours of rainbow...

250
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:25,355
When asked what's your colour,
white went white blushing...

251
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:30,398
I'll accept that you're great...

252
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:34,833
But I'll not tell you that...

253
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:38,372
Your words are magical love...

254
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:31,959
My love line is longer than
equator of earth...

255
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:37,124
My heart is a gram heavier
than earth...

256
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:42,136
Even temple rings can't pull
me away from your thoughts...

257
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:47,175
Look at this strange thing I can't say
a word without uttering your name...

258
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:52,304
Where was all this enthusiasm
hidden till now?

259
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:56,578
Am I also in love like you?

260
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:59,985
My like is waiting for your love...

261
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:12,863
It's time!

262
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:18,873
Please sir, I'll never come late again.

263
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,566
My brief wasn't dry,
so I got late. sir.

264
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:26,239
It'll never get dry,
come on time even if brief is wet.

265
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:30,114
Punctuality Prabhanjan, if I get
caught, he'll eat my brain.

266
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,016
I'll give complaint card,
meet the owner.

267
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:34,248
I didn't get Punctuality Prabhanjan
name for nothing.

268
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,415
Go and meet the owner.

269
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,729
Greetings sir.

270
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,268
If you don't have sense of time,

271
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,836
what's the difference between
humans and mannequins?

272
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,603
Humans must be sensitive,
attitude and sensible.

273
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:00,616
Get lost!

274
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:07,623
What to do now?

275
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:12,590
I'll go to the counter behind
this without getting caught.

276
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,031
Whose legs are these?

277
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,963
What's this?
- Today is my birthday, sir.

278
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,575

289
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:00,465
What's this nuisance?

290
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,302
What happened?

291
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,174

He pulled away my belt.

292
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,610
ls this way to behave?

293
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,841
What do you think of yourself?
- It never happened here.

00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:16,357
We've the same stock in another
counter, I'll show you, madam.

295
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:24,426
You're singing duet with heroine
and turned supervisor into a comedian,

296
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,125

297
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,271
There's not villain in
your love story, right?

298
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,702
Why not?
- Who is that fool?

299
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:32,867
My Maha
akshmi's father!

300
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:35,374
Where's he?
- He's there!

301
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:47,051
Hello! Why are you still here?
The TV you gave is ready here.

302
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,385
If you discharge with it,
I'll recharge immediately.

303
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,390
What's this, uncle?

304
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,893
Uncle?
Who is uncle to you?

305
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:56,726
I've a name, it's Subba Rao!
Call me as Subba Rao!

306
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,461
When I got you an LCD TV,

307
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:03,367
you insisted I call you as uncle,
said it's music to your ears.

308
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:07,066
Moreover you promised to get
your daughter married to me.

309
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:11,009
I promised with my mouth only
not on promissory note, right?

310
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:12,512
I'll tell you the logic, come.

311
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:16,378
Isn't LED TV better than LCD or not?
- Better.

312
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:19,420
Isn't Sunny car better than Nano?
- Better!

313
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,684
See, you've accepted
the truth yourself.

314
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:24,417
What ever it is,
it is for better only.

315
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,826
Look, here comes Sunny with LED TV!

316
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,261
Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,871
Keep LED safely in house.
- Okay sir.

318
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,439
Very good quality, Subba Rao.
- Subba Rao?

319
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,304
Why are you calling me by name
like a stranger?

320
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:43,776
Call me as uncle,
it's music to my ears.

321
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,039
Okay, uncle.

322
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:47,114
Please come. Come.

323
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,079
Move aside, son-in-law is coming, right?

324
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,278
Who is he, uncle?
- Some roadside Romeo, forget him.

325
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:54,583
Please sit down.

326
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:59,122
Dear, get a coffee for LED son-in-law.

327
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,332
How is it?
- Very nice! Bru coffee, right?

328
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:14,705
I didn't ask about coffee,
about my daughter.

329
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,142
I like her.

330
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:18,976
As soon as your grandpa's
property is transferred to your name,

331
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,174
let's fix the marriage.
- Okay uncle.

332
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,477
I'll take leave.

333
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,480
Bye, uncle.
- Okay.

334
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:27,652
My son-in-law is 100 kilos
of pure gold.

335
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:32,026
What's this drama every week?

336
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:36,393
You bring a rich man and
say he's would be son-in-law.

337
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,830
How many will you change
like TV channels?

338
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,937
ls that fat man would be son-in-law?

339
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,164
Would any father do like this?

340
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,637
Can't avoid it, silly woman!

341
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,741
Had we stopped with telephone,
would cell phones have come?

342
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:49,742
Had we stopped with TV,
would computers had come?

343
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,710
There's no compromise in betterment.

344
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,612
I'll not fix my daughter's
marriage with a clerk like me.

345
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:56,275
I'll find a rich son-in-law.

346
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,546
I'll have a blast like
my boss Jagadamba!

347
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,020
Challenges don't suit
your personality, dad.

348
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,853
If necessary, I'll increase my
personality but never give up ambition.

349
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,824
This is a challenge with Jagadamba.

350
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:09,193
You always talk about Jagadamba.
What exactly did she do to you?

351
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,358
Before I tell what she did,
I must tell what she was doing,

352
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,471
when I was a clerk with
a Municipal contractor,

353
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:18,039
you know what was Jagadamba's condition!

354
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:29,812
Mother, I brought you lunch.
- Why did you come in hot sun, dear?

355
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:34,081
Whosoever marries you is
really very lucky man!

356
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:35,383
My sweet darling!

357
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,426
Talk to your daughter in home,
do your work here.

358
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,859
I've to answer the contractor.

359
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,295
Okay, sir.
- Okay, go.

360
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:45,893
What is Jagadamba's position now?

361
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:50,469
What's those discrepancies
in the accounts?

362
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:53,006
If you can't write accounts well,
get yourself a tuition teacher.

363
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:56,608
You've mentioned about 20 packs of
dog biscuits but only 19 are there,

364
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:59,908
where's the last pack?
Did you eat it?

365
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,676
If you cheat me like that
Municipal contractor,

366
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:06,084
I'll rip out your skin!
How is that?

367
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:10,857
She was a lowly paid worker
but behaves like Lady Ambani,

368
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,187
who is responsible for this change?

369
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:14,226
Her daughter junior Jagadamba.

370
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:17,923
She trapped my contractor's son
and married him.

371
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:21,366
Jagadamba's life changed after
getting a rich son-in-law.

372
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:24,507
If with an ordinary daughter
Jagadamba can do this,

373
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:27,268
what great things can I achieve
with a beautiful daughter!

374
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,606
I'm doing all this to find
a great proposal for her.

375
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:35,377
Many a young men have to get
sacrificed at the altar.

376
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:41,785
Why are you laughing loud
like a tooth paste model?

377
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:47,362
A billionaire is in love with me,

378
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:50,762
would I tell you that
he owns Kalanikethan mall?

379
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,866
Kalanikethan owner?

380
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:59,236
Would I tell you his photo
in that book's 36th page?

381
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:12,345
My sweet darling!

382
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:16,822
I knew an intelligent father like
would have a clever daughter like you.

383
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,756
That you'd make my dream come true.

384
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,625
Keep quiet dad.
- I can't.

385
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:26,235
What can I give you in
this happy moment?

386
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:29,270
Other than being born as your child
with a golden spoon!

387
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:30,429
What did you tell him?

388
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:33,771
Did you say I'm a billionaire
and own this shop?

389
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:36,844
Even with my four months' salary,
I can't buy a suit here,

390
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,880
if you say I own this shopping mall,
who would believe it?

391
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,415
If they don't believe,
you must make them believe it.

392
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:46,044
If not my dad brings some rich guy
and says he's my husband.

393
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:48,452
Will you lie to him
that I own this mall?

394
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,115
There must be a limit
to tell lies.

395
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:51,624
If I tell my dad is coming there now,

396
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:56,789
if you don't make him believe
that you own the mall,

397
00:30:56,988 --> 00:31:00,265
not only in this life, we can't
marry in any life after this,

398
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:01,836
1 what would be your position
on hearing this?

399
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,471
ls your dad coming here?

400
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:06,667
Not coming,
he would've already come.

401
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:15,710
Difficult if you don't know the size.

402
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:19,018
My boy friend Kamal's personality
is just like him, sir.

403
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:19,813
ls it?

404
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:22,219
Please come here. Faster!

405
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:25,494
It seems her boy friend is just like you.

406
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,119
Remove your dress,
she'll see a trial on you.

407
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:29,526
Dress only, show her a trial and
go to the counter immediately.

408
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:31,064
Wear this coat.

409
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:32,799
Just coat only, right?

410
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:35,404
Why did he ask me to remove
my dress then?

411
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:41,802
Very good!

412
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,140
Can you please come walking
from a little distance?

413
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:46,179
Okay.

414
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:57,189
Son-in-law is handsome with likes
of Prabhas and Mahesh Babu.

415
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:59,155
This is okay.
- Would you like anything else, madam?

416
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,389
Kama
's brief size is...

417
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:03,725
I know the size, pack it.

418
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:05,390
Briefs are there.

419
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,830
She knows brief size
but not the coat size.

420
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:14,805
What would you like to see sir?
Suiting or shirting?

421
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:17,104
I want your legs.
- Legs?

422
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:18,109
If your legs are free,

423
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,873
I'll wash and give my daughter
in marriage to you.

424
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,678
Are you Maha
akshmi's father?

425
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:29,291
Why are you calling me as sir?
call me as father-in-law.

426
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,723
It'll be fine for you to call
and fine to hear for me.

427
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:35,421
How long will you take?
Will you show or not?

428
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:38,294
That counter salesman will come,
please wait, madam.

429
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,125
Silk border, madam.

430
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,995
Where is Buchi?
Taking so much time for a trial.

431
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,162
Where has he gone?

432
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,875
Pack this and send it
to billing counter.

433
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,546
Don't he know he must be
in the counter?

434
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:53,683
What do you think of yourselves?
Salesmen or customers?

435
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:55,818
Will you please take your hands off?

436
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:56,811
Please see this madam.

437
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:57,544
When did he come?

438
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,154
It has embroidery work too.

439
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,311
Where is he?

440
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,819
There are few other colours
in this model.

441
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:05,259
How about this, madam?

442
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,827
Why is so-in-law showing
like salesman?

443
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:11,398
Received today morning only.
Very good for summer.

444
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:17,538
Learn it! How many times
do I've to teach you?

445
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,664
Show it to customers like this.

446
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:21,674
Why am I working here as one of you?

447
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,507
So that you'd learn to work,
come good in life.

448
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,671
Father-in-law! How come you're here?

449
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,780
Please come.
- Learn from him.

450
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,443
Don't give him tension.
- He'll learn.

451
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:33,020
How can anyone prosper
without working hard?

452
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,282
Sir, call letter for you.

453
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,353
What's that, son-in-law?

454
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:42,527
Nothing Bombay Dyeing people
are here for my advice.

455
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,132
Please sit here,
I'll come back in a minute.

456
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:46,427
No problem, I'll look around
our shop, you carry on.

457
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:47,365
Okay.

458
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:55,771
Normally he shouts if anyone
comes with complaint card.

459
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,104
That too in working hours.

460
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,814
He'll start an epic!

461
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,314
How to manage him?
- What?

462
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,221
The piece is here!

463
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:12,419
Not stays in the counter.

464
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:17,526
Human must be sensitive
and have self respect.

465
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:28,570
Get lost!

466
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:38,253
Let's sit and talk, father-in-law.

467
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,286
Why anywhere else?
Let's sit in your room, son-in-law.

468
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:41,082
In my room?

469
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,249
I want to see you sitting
in the chairman's seat.

470
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,326
Looks like the short man
will get me into trouble.

471
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:53,363
Please come, let's go and sit inside.

472
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:05,413
Son-in-law, if you don't mind,
can I sit in your seat?

473
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,607
Feel free as if this is your office,
please sit down, uncle.

474
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:08,614
Please sit.

475
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:19,990
He calls as and when he feels like.

476
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:32,936
Clean this dust bin.

477
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,810
Clean this also.

478
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:43,779
What's this switch?

479
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:46,547
If you press it, supervisor
and other staff would come.

480
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:48,656
Why did you press it?

481
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:52,851
Son-in-law, I want see you
commanding your staff.

482
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,223
Please sit.

483
00:35:57,121 --> 00:36:00,125
Oh no! Supervisor is here.
I must speak like Chairman.

484
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:02,494
Tell me sir.

485
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,968
What should I tell you?

486
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,199
No shirt buttons, no oil on hair.

487
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:08,776
salesman is coming late,
sales man is not in counter,

488
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:12,244
you only complain on others,
what the heck you do here?

489
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:16,182
If customers are Gods,
salesmen are priests.

490
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,378
Humans must be sensitive,
shyness and shame.

491
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,023
Go, look after the sales.

492
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:22,354
Excellent!

493
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:33,224
You were fantastic, son-in-law
...great job!

494
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:37,533
I'm always like that I change
my voice to scold them.

495
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:46,142
I'll also join them.

496
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,083
That bell rings due to
short circuit problem.

497
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:56,485
Let's go, customers are waiting.
- Let's go to counters.

498
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:06,195
I do play such fun for relaxation.

499
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,394
This is what you call
as work is play.

500
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:11,136
Come.

501
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:14,835
Who is he?

502
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:18,139
Father-in-law of this show owner.
- My father-in-law?

503
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:20,509
Not yours but his father-in-law.

504
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:23,081
Stop!

505
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:27,087
He claims to be your father-in-law
and also mine, who is he anyway?

506
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:32,092
He's little mad, hsi son-in-law went
bankrupt after running a showroom.

507
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:35,060
Since then he lost his balance and
visits showrooms and behaves like this.

508
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:38,598
Last week there was a box news
about him in newspapers.

509
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:41,567
He entered your room,
I was sending him out, sir.

510
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:43,603
Customers are waiting,
I'll go, sir.

511
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:49,042
Who is he?
Why does he think he's the owner?

512
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:50,201
He's the owner.

513
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:52,814
Years ago, he lost everything
in races and became a pauper.

514
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:53,914
He sold this to me.

515
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:58,816
He lost his mental balance and roams
here as if he's owns this place.

516
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:02,480
He once owned this place, right?
I pity him.

517
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:04,024
Come, father-in-law.

518
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,960
Where's Buchi? Went away again?

519
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:12,400
We met after many days,
shall we go to club?

520
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:14,763
No need to use two cars,
let's go in my car.

521
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:18,964
Excuse me, 7777 BMW is in parking area,

522
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:22,566
please handover this and
tell the driver to go home.

523
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:24,144
3Sha

 we go?
- Come.

524
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:28,848
Work like this!

525
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:30,144
Should I've to tell you everything?

526
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,982
Auto is waiting,
I'll go now, son-in-law.

527
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,182
No need of auto, I'll have you
dropped in my BMW.

528
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:44,594
Son-in-law, I'll cut the auto.
- Okay.

529
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:52,172
Madam told me to give you this,

530
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:53,808
your madam's guest is here,

531
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:55,500
she told you to drop him
at his house and go home.

532
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,201
Okay.

533
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,641
I sent him away.
- Sir is here.

534
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,509
Greetings sir, please get in sir.

535
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,406
I'm Romeo's brother...

536
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:31,377
I'm a part Devadass and Shahjahan...

537
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:38,475
I'm Juliet's sister and
descendent of Parvathi...

538
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:42,385
I'm Mumtaz...

539
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:48,963
I've crossed Everest
in my love long back...

540
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:53,125
I've united your name
with mine long back...

541
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:56,601
I was hearing the
love ring tone till now...

542
00:39:56,761 --> 00:40:00,470
Now I found out it belongs to you...

543
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:04,238
Something lovely is pulling
towards you...

544
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:08,042
I'll make your heart
my permanent abode...

545
00:40:54,418 --> 00:41:02,098
I'm Rama and you're my Seetha...
new Ramayana has began...

546
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:12,573
You're Krishna and I'm Radha...
new romantic story has begun...

547
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:16,240
You're like sun flower
following sun...

548
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:19,854
You're fragrant aroma
like coffee...

549
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:27,258
You're my daily horoscope
of happiness...

550
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:30,956
I'll be January 1st of
your calendar...

551
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:34,760
Settle down on your lips
like Candyman...

552
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:38,304
I'll copy all wishes and
desires in eyes...

553
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:42,410
I'll paste it in the system
of love eyes...

554
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:04,827
Our love postings must flood
Facebook and Twitter...

555
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:15,336
Our love must be the breaking news
on TV news channels...

556
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:18,777
I'm giving you my heart...

557
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:22,645
My entry and exit of every live
is with you only...

558
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:30,122
I'm mischief of youth and
I'm giving all of it to you...

559
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:33,785
I'll download the melody
of your words...

560
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:37,524
I'll produce music in your arms
like a maestro...

561
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:41,031
I'll roam in your world like butterfly...

562
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:44,832
I'll stay with you every summer...

563
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:57,512
I mistook for my house
and entered it.

564
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:00,155
No confusion,
this is our house only.

565
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:01,756
Give this.

566
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:06,884
I was waiting for you.

567
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:09,827
Sign here, your mother too signed it.

568
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:10,761
What's this?

569
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:14,233
Why no objection certificate?

570
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:18,396
You sign it first.
Sign it.

571
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:25,145
Take it, Seth!

572
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:26,372
What is it father?

573
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:30,110
You're going to marry a rich man,
how can you remain poor?

574
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:33,812
If your husband sees this place
and thinks cheaply about us,

575
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:35,321
I can't tolerate that,

576
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:37,982
that's why I made these
arrangements to match his range.

577
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:38,956
What about money?

578
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:45,431
I've taken Rs.30 lakhs loan as first
installment from this money lender.

579
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:47,796
Rs.30 lakhs?
- Just at 15% interest only.

580
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,995
Isn't it?
- Right, sir, I'll go now.

581
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,138
Go!

582
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,969
Why have you tied him like
taking a goat to meat shop?

583
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,079
Who is he?

584
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:01,648
He took loan and defaulted.

585
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:05,184
That's why as per the agreement,
I'm taking him to sell his kidneys.

586
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:06,844
Agreement to sell kidneys?

587
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:11,426
We used to lend money on
farms and houses,

588
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:15,462
we faced problems because of litigations
due to various reasons,

589
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:19,465
that's why we're lending money
on body parts.

590
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:24,937
For safe side they're taking
NOC from family members also.

591
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:28,474
You signed on NOC only.

592
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:31,671
Did you lend money to my father...
- On kidneys only.

593
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:34,611
I've taken the rights
to sell his two kidneys.

594
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:40,246
It's your responsibility to protect his kidneys
by giving him 3 litres of water every day.

595
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:41,285
Father!

596
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:42,585
Just formalities only.

597
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:45,022
Only defaulters must be scared,
why should we?

598
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:48,095
After your marriage,
won't son-in-law pay repay it like tip?

599
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:51,529
Let's ask son-in-law to pay him
Rs.10 lakhs extra,

600
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:53,998
he has children,
it'll help him earn more interest.

601
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:55,660
You're very graceful, sir.

602
00:44:55,859 --> 00:45:00,103
Do you've a beautiful daughter?
- No.

603
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:03,211
Why did you take loan without
a beautiful daughter?

604
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,974
Not only kidneys and eyes,
they must take your heart and liver.

605
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:10,744
I think his bad luck may stick to us,
please take him away, Seth.

606
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:12,683
Bye sir.
- Bye.

607
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:15,585
Go.
- He must live without kidneys.

608
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,227
I'll go to Jagadamba's house.
- How will you go?

609
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,987
Autos are striking work.

610
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:24,064
We don't have to travel
in autos and buses.

611
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,565
I've booked BMW auto gear car.

612
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:28,293
Delivery will take little time,

613
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:32,805
meanwhile I've booked a Honda car
from travel agency.

614
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:45,585
How is it? Do you've brain
or lent it to live?

615
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:48,417
You know today evening is
my son-in-law's birthday party.

616
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,081
Don't you know there's work here?

617
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:54,218
Are you coming like a VIP now?

618
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:56,728
If anything goes wrong in the party,

619
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,732
I'll make you security guard
of this house, be careful.

620
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:04,537
I've an important meeting,
but you're more important, right?

621
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:06,368
I'll definitely make it.

622
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:08,205
What happened?

623
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:13,178
There's a birthday party today evening,
my father-in-law insists I must come.

624
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:16,375
You should get tension if asks for
party, why to attend a party?

625
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,384
Go, have two pegs, eat food
and enjoy the party.

626
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:22,888
It's a star hotel
not lrani hotel to go as you like.

627
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:25,048
Moreover dress code is compulsory.

628
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:25,989
Suit?

629
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:29,256
Like a bank clerk, he has money
all around him but not his,

630
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:31,956
though there are so many suits here,
we can only see not use it.

631
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,533
No money to buy it.

632
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:37,194
Don't worry, I know a man who
stitches suits for less money.

633
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:38,362
Try if he can make it in your budget.

634
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:40,304
Where?
- Krishna Nagar.

635
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:44,068
You want a suit for Rs.1500 and
can I offer 30% discount also?

636
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:44,871
Thanks you sir.

637
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:47,709
Funny fellow! Would any fool
stitch a suit for Rs.1500?

638
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:49,407
There's public talk that you do.

639
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:53,146
Give this golden opportunity
to someone else, leave me.

640
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:58,259
Hey lazy! Get ready those two suits
before I m back.- Okay.

641
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,491
I feel pity on seeing you, brother.

642
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,566
I've decided to stitch a suit
for Rs.1500.

643
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:07,201
Can you stitch a suit?

644
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:10,328
Who built Taj Mahal?
- Shahjahan.- Masons.

645
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,201
He's Shahjahan and I'm mason.

646
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:14,805
Money please.

647
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:16,508
Take it.

648
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,877
I must your size.
- What?

649
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:20,777
Your hip size.
Take the measurements.

650
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,676
3 and 2, 32!

651
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:31,119
Legs 44!

652
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:33,450
14!

653
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,489
18!

654
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:37,827
18 here also.

655
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:40,828
Are you raping or taking measurements?
- Length 22!

656
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:46,069
I want to stitch a shirt,

657
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:49,040
will you say I can do only
buttons and holes?

658
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:52,510
I found a scapegoat.
I'll stitch a suit now.

659
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:53,908
How long man?
- Over, sir.

660
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:55,812
Did you take down the measurements?
- I did.

661
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,287
What happened?
- I'm drowsy, I need liquor.

662
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:06,155
Pour the liquor in coat into mouth.

663
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,126
Have it.

664
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,931
What's this?
- Nothing, brother.

665
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:19,131
Since my mother's milk didn't suit me,
my father gave me liquor.

666
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:21,572
I can't be fine when I feel
drowsy without liquor.

667
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:23,507
Don't know what's the
middle class problems are!

668
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:27,205
Let's stitch a suit from the cloth
owner saved for himself.- Okay.

669
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:45,695
Looks like junction is jammed.
OVery tight.

670
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:47,199
Rates decide suits.

671
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:50,601
I'm getting late to party,
this is too tight.

672
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,105
If suit gives in party,
I'll lose my honour.

673
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,004
Let's do one thing.

674
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:57,702
I'll also attend the party
in a suit.

675
00:48:57,868 --> 00:48:58,369
Why?

676
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:02,642
If there's any tear, I'll stitch it
without anyone seeing it.

677
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:03,910
Okay, come.

678
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:07,117
Greetings.
- Greetings.

679
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:08,285
Please go inside.

680
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:14,490
Why are you staring here?

681
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:16,756
Look after the guests well.

682
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,400
There mustn't be any let up.

683
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:22,127
Greetings.
- Greetings.

684
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:23,700
What are you looking at?

685
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:26,932
Why did you bring me to a party?

686
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,642
I must show a film to Jagadamba, right?

687
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:37,911
Here comes my Aladdin's lamp!

688
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:44,859
Why are you waving hand?
- It's free, so I waved.

689
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:46,517
Coat arm pit gave it.

690
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:12,344
Why are you standing here, son-in-law?

691
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:13,749
You're the hero of this function.

692
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,514
Please come.
- Why father-in-law?

693
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:27,660
Before I take next step,
please dance with my daughter.

694
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:53,755
Cover me.

695
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:22,752
Come here.

696
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:43,001
Give me your hand.

697
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,813
Someone is calling you, go.

698
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:58,289
Who?
- Samantha- Me?

699
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:07,832
Would you like to have whisky?
- I drink only milk.

700
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:10,699
Please forgive me.
I drink only whisky.

701
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:12,801
Do you drink every day?
- I'll quit at times.

702
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,409
Why is he acting like rich man in party?

703
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:17,138
There's something fishy.

704
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,075
This is the right time to
get back my money.

705
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:20,615
Why is he here?

706
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:23,580
Sir, you promised Rs.1000 to buy
medicines for my great grandpa.

707
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:24,980
When?
- That day!

708
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:27,145
You'd have,
please give him, son-in-law.

709
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:33,260
You're great sir.

710
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:37,125
You're so great that
I can't explain it, sir.

711
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:40,494
Your generosity is making me cry, sir.

712
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:43,731
Take care of your
great grandpa's health.

713
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:53,508
How would he know what you gave him
is just a drop of an ocean?

714
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,683
Son-in-law is very controlled,
self controlled man.

715
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,510
Will you go for drinks on smell?
Stitch it.

716
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:01,949
Do it fast.

717
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,147
Nobody saw it, right?

718
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:32,815
Did you get the suit on hire?

719
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,484
To tell the truth,
you're great in this dress.

720
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:40,721
I'm telling the truth.

721
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,498
Are you fine?

722
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:50,399
I'm feeling drowsy.

723
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:01,439
What happened?
- I'm drowsy. I want liquor.

724
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:02,948
Bloody weakness. . .wait.

725
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:05,586
Drowsy...
iquor!

726
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:08,186
He's the right man.

727
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:24,638
Liquor...
- Take it.

728
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,067
Tell me what else?

729
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:32,270
Where is Subba Rao?

730
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:37,275
Address my name with respect, Jagadamba!

731
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:53,462
What's this stare?
What's this new style and get up?

732
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,569
Have you gone mad after
having drinks?

733
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:57,602
You're going to get mad now, Jagadamba.

734
00:54:57,761 --> 00:55:00,469
Why are you shouting?
I'll fire you.

735
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,110
As if this is Collector's job.

736
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,973
To hell with you and
your bloody job.

737
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,378
Silly woman!
I'll buy it back.

738
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:13,549
If you can be so proud for having
an ordinary rich man as son-in-law,

739
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:17,658
how proud should I be for having a
son-in-law who pays crores as tax?

740
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,158
Would you like to see my golden goose?

741
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:22,422
Son-in-law! Make a grand entry!

742
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:24,293
Your father is getting me
into trouble.

743
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:25,827
He's my son-in-law.

744
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:29,493
Your son-in-law is like an ATM,
it may run out of money,

745
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:33,072
my son-in-law is like RBI,
it'll never run out of money.

746
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:37,507
You'll be swept off your feet
on knowing who my son-in-law is!

747
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:39,812
What's this?
- Do you know who my son-in-law is?

748
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:42,848
Chairman of Kalanikethan group
of shopping malls.

749
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:45,350
Chairman of Kalanikethan?
- Any doubt?

750
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,283
Then who am I?

751
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:50,885
You?
Why is the mad man here?

752
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:52,993
Am I mad? You mad man!

753
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:55,789
Buchi, tell me, who is mad?
- You!

754
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:59,456
Who am I?
- You're Chairman of Kalanikethan.

755
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:01,829
Who are you?
- Salesman there.

756
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:03,026
Tell that mad man!

757
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,730
Yes, father-in-law,
he's the real owner.

758
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:07,875
I'm just a salesman.

759
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:12,104
Son-in-law!
- Yes father. We lied to you.

760
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:14,544
Lie...
- Lied to you.

761
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:25,116
Humans must be sensitive,
shyness, shame and pride.

762
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:28,023
I got it, sir.
You've fired me, right?

763
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,031
He gives and then takes it away.

764
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:34,734
Are you swept off your feet, Subba Rao?

765
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:39,237
Madam, please forgive me
for my mistake.

766
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:41,875
Please take whatever has
happened as nothing.

767
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:43,840
I'll come to office on time
from tomorrow.

768
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,537
You've been fired 30 minutes earlier.

769
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:49,081
How?
- Like that.

770
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:53,945
Father-in-law!
- Sorry, father.

771
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:57,319
We didn't want to cheat you,
thought you'd adjust after marriage.

772
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,084
We didn't expect this.

773
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,391
Lorry is coming, I'll die.

774
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:05,397
Father, please...
please listen to me...

775
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:09,066
Bikes?

776
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:10,334
No sound?

777
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:12,632
Father, no...

778
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:16,334
Allow me to die.
I lost my honour before Jagadamba.

779
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:19,104
You must regain it,
you shouldn't talk about death.

780
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,213
Don't talk to me.

781
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:22,873
You trapped my daughter and planned
to become my in-house son-in-law.

782
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:24,643
As if you're great Bill Gates!

783
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:26,219
I planned to become
your son-in-law.

784
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:28,287
Neither he planned nor trapped me.

785
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,788
I fell for him on my own.

786
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,952
Electric wire!

787
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:34,058
Father!

788
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:35,361
Father!

789
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,620
I'm dying!
I'm dead.

790
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:39,995
That's cable wire, you can't die.

791
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:43,137
Father, I'm your daughter.

792
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,364
I too have the sane pride you have.

793
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,498
You want a rich son-in-law.

794
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:49,166
That's all, isn't it?
- Will she dump me?

795
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:52,644
You want to die because he's not the
owner of the shopping mall,

796
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:57,342
he'll become owner of a bigger mall
and marry me with great pride.

797
00:57:57,507 --> 00:57:59,077
This is my challenge.

798
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:00,313
Please give me some time.

799
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,479
Are 50 or 60 years enough, dear?

800
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:07,958
No need, Buchi will marry me in
6 months coming back as rich as Ambani.

801
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:09,460
Me?
- Yes.

802
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:12,395
Our love will make you a winner.

803
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:18,303
You're like Lord Anjaneya,
you don't know your power.

804
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:24,378
You're going to become
a billionaire for my sake.

805
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:25,342
That's all!

806
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:28,948
I'll become a billionaire, that's all!

807
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:30,243
If it doesn't happen.

808
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:33,910
Your daughter will marry
the man of your choice.

809
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:37,354
I'll come back after 6 months as mall
owner and call you as father-in-law.

810
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,016
This is our challenge.

811
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:44,021
Did you throw a challenge
to own a shopping mall?

812
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,861
I got emotional then.

813
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:51,405
Are you Chiranjeevi of Challenge
or Venkatesh of Kondapalli Raja?

814
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:52,595
You're just Naresh of Kevvu Keka.

815
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:54,708
Should I throw a challenge
if I'm Naresh?

816
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:57,208
Should I earn crores in one song?

817
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,040
If you say shouldn't, you can...

818
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,647
But how?
- That's why I've started.

819
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:01,804
Robbing?

820
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:02,745
Song!

821
00:59:02,906 --> 00:59:04,544
Back ground song.

822
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:08,814
Victory is yours,
no need to worry...

823
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:15,520
March ahead without any inhibitions...

824
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:23,226
Life is ajourney of struggles...

825
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:27,535
Victory is in struggles...

826
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:39,346
Your way is path of flowers,
march ahead, boy...

827
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:44,509
As your wishes come true,
it's victory bugles...

828
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:56,570
Men can become sages
with dedication...

829
00:59:56,759 --> 01:00:00,571
Can become great men...

830
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:08,441
How much you earned in a month?

831
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:11,948
Ask me how much I'm left with.
Rs.632 only.

832
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:18,420
Not much, just Rs.9999368 only to earn!

833
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:22,393
Do you need background songs
for this paltry sum?

834
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:26,796
Auto earnings were enough
for police and petrol bills.

835
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,835
Money from stone crushing
work went for doctor bills.

836
01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:32,599
Money carrying loads were
spent on chicken leg pieces.

837
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,241
If you earn like this,
forget about shopping mall,

838
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:37,072
you can't even run a
cut piece centre opposite to it.

839
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:39,474
Okay, I've taken a decision.

840
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,843
What's that?
- Would I tell you?

841
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:45,680
If you fail to earn money
after 6 months,

842
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:48,152
unable to marry the man
of my dad's choice,

843
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:49,722
unable to live without you,

844
01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:52,189
would I tell you that I've
decided to commit suicide?

845
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:53,884
Commit suicide?

846
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:56,723
Though it's crooked decision,
tell me that straight.

847
01:00:56,853 --> 01:01:04,203
Would I tell you that I've already
brought cyanide for safer side?

848
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,635
I'm not that foolish.

849
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:08,032
That's my flashback, uncle.

850
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:11,474
It's impossible to become
Ambani in 6 months.

851
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:15,606
That mad girl is roaming with cyanide
like an Al-Qaida terrorist.

852
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:17,046
Silly girl would do as she says.

853
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:18,810
I can't die after watching her death.

854
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:20,352
That's why I thought of
dying before her.

855
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,387
Why did you go to star hotel for that?

856
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:26,516
I was born a poor man,
I thought of dying like a rich man.

857
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,356
Where did you get so much
money for that?

858
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:32,022
I must thank you.
- Why me?

859
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:36,398
I sold off your ne Nano car
to ajunk seller.

860
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:43,576
What have you done, O my God!

861
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:47,203
Are you crying for car
instead of being happy for me?

862
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,908
Uncle, you've proved again that
relationships are materialistic only.

863
01:01:51,074 --> 01:01:53,577
Such heavy dialogues
will not suit you.

864
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:55,245
I didn't cry for that.
- Why then?

865
01:01:55,411 --> 01:02:00,360
If it hadn't happened like that,
you wouldn't be in this situation.

866
01:02:00,516 --> 01:02:03,395
What hadn't had happened and when?
Tell me clearly, uncle.

867
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:06,966
Till now you told me flashback
which I didn't know.

868
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:10,037
I'll tell you now your flashback
which you don't know.

869
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:13,766
My flashback which I don't know myself?
- Yes, child episode.

870
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:17,241
You came at right time, hear my
flashback which I too don't know.

871
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,743
Who is she?
- Heroine.

872
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:21,507
World beauty?
You too hear it, dear.

873
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:25,050
As you think you weren't born as poor.

874
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:28,621
Your father Ramamurthy is
your village's headman!

875
01:02:32,815 --> 01:02:35,318
He didn't even look at a school.

876
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:37,431
No interest?
- No school in village.

877
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:40,090
But still he was very popular.

878
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:49,034
If anyone needed help,
your father would be very glad.

879
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:51,769
Village used to get flooded
with water.

880
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:55,472
He fought with govt. for a dam.
- Did govt. oblige?

881
01:02:55,638 --> 01:02:56,378
It did.

882
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:59,713
Did they build a dam?
- They arrested and beat your father.

883
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:02,152
Then, Pedarayudu took a decision.

884
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:06,453
He collected money form people
to build a dam of their own.

885
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:12,197
Just then your dad's childhood friends
Tata Rao and Goapalakrishna entered.

886
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:16,132
Your father gave them money
since they were educated,

887
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:19,604
and sent them in train
to Delhi for permissions.

888
01:03:19,762 --> 01:03:23,141
They ran away with money, right?
People took my father, right?

889
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,472
How do you know that?
- As if there's a big twist in it,

890
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,273
Tamil dubbing films have
this routine flashback.

891
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:28,346
What happened then?

892
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:32,577
Unable to hear the accusations,
he gave away his property to village,

893
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:36,087
and left the village with wife
and children as a poor man.

894
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:38,623
Why didn't you tell me this
lousy flashback till now?

895
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:40,260
Because it's lousy!

896
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:44,489
Fearing you'd become a killer
by seeking revenge on them.

897
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:45,894
As if I'm Prabhas and Junior NTR!

898
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:48,001
I'll go with Rajamou
i's
weapons to hack them.

899
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:50,501
Where are those cheats now?

900
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:53,140
I know the whereabouts of Gopalakrishna.

901
01:03:53,296 --> 01:03:55,503
Recently got connected
to him on Facebook.

902
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:58,703
He's a big shot in Bangkok.

903
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:19,329
We must get that 1000 crore project.

904
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:36,439
Take it...take it...

905
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:40,679
Are you office boy or boss?
Why are you sleeping in day time?

906
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:43,346
This is not sleep but
Yoga meditation!

907
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:48,120
My grandma told me before her
death I would become a king.

908
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:01,736
These are the garment designs
which you've to finalize.

909
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:05,504
If you see and okay it,
we'll send it to stitching section.

910
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:14,077
Your work would help greatly
for this company to develop.

911
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:18,590
Your hard work would surely
be rewarded in near future.

912
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:25,189
If boss is so positive, I'm sure
you'll be the next Vice president.

913
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:27,834
We're doing all this for
that only, right?

914
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:30,902
Has New York material come?

915
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:33,733
Not yet, madam hasn't yet
cleared the cheque.

916
01:05:33,896 --> 01:05:36,706
That spiker company?
- Madam didn't clear that too.

917
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:39,142
Unless you both sign...

918
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:44,684
She's a sadist wife.
She's a hurdle even to sign cheques.

919
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:47,411
I committed myself for her wealth.

920
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:50,557
I pray even a Pakistani shouldn't
get such a sadist wife.

921
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:58,131
When I hear that I feel like hugging
like a child to comfort you.

922
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:02,599
You indeed have a large heart!

923
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:04,596
What's your program?

924
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:07,639
Need to visit beauty parlour
for eye brow shaping.

925
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,641
I asked about my program, sweetie.

926
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:13,645
Discussion about divorcing your wife.

927
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:21,553
Janu, you've misunderstood me.

928
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:25,181
I'm nothing without you.
Please let's stay together.

929
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:27,692
You can't cheat me with film titles.

930
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:30,524
You love my wealth more than me.

931
01:06:30,686 --> 01:06:33,360
Madam, please think again
and take a decision.

932
01:06:33,522 --> 01:06:36,731
Madam has taken a firm decision.
Very firm!

933
01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:42,171
Janu, for trivial issues...
- ls the hotel issue trivial?

934
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:43,605
Trivial issue?

935
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:16,835
Not again!
Please go to sleep.

936
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,580
Please give me at least
30 minutes rest, darling.

937
01:07:21,737 --> 01:07:23,216
I can't do it.

938
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:26,718
Who are you?
What is he doing with you?

939
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:27,854
Who is he next to me?

940
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:29,489
Who are you?
What are you doing in my room?

941
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:30,623
This is my room.

942
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:33,590
This is my room.
She's my wife.

943
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:35,958
What are you both doing in my room?

944
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:37,859
This is my room.
- This is my room.

945
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:39,363
I'll prove it now.

946
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:43,668
Got it, lawyer?

947
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:46,204
Though I was with him,
he entered another room,

948
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:49,900
what could be his intention?
-You know I walk in sleep.

949
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:51,237
That's a ruse!

950
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,574
That's a ruse to get rid of me.

951
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:57,743
Boss, don't get angry.

952
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:00,410
Please don't ask for divorce in anger.

953
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:07,554
It'll take 6 months to get divorce.

954
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:09,389
Since you both are partners
of the company,

955
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:12,260
according rules of the company
if you both split up,

956
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:14,561
wealth must be divided
into two equal shares,

957
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:15,428
can't avoid it.

958
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:22,600
ls the brief with holes yours, uncle?
- I never use briefs.

959
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:24,843
Why?

960
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:30,645
What's this like blood mark?

961
01:08:30,806 --> 01:08:31,648
Lip mark!

962
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:36,552
You're going to Bangkok to bring
back lost wealth from the cheats.

963
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:38,385
I wish you victory.

964
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:42,256
I'll come back wealthy
getting back my money.

965
01:08:42,418 --> 01:08:45,297
Anyway we'll see it
on silver screen, right?

966
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:47,559
Why are you removing her nail polish?

967
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:49,100
Come, we're getting late to flight.

968
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:04,415
Our MD will announce the
new Vice President now.

969
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:12,324
Today we're in this position
because of your hard work.

970
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:22,268
As this company's Vice president,

971
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:28,670
I'm appointing Alaknanda,
my personal secretary.

972
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:37,444
I need comfort in such times.

973
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:45,155
Did you see nephew? What a big
building that cheat has built?

974
01:09:45,314 --> 01:09:48,158
He'll build because it's
others' money, right?

975
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,990
When he said you'll be rewarded,
I thought something else.

976
01:09:51,153 --> 01:09:52,689
I didn't expect he would
cheat like this.

977
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,266
How would that creep
look like, uncle?

978
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:56,994
He'd be like a snuff inhaling sucker.

979
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:59,161
He looks like Chinese, its not him.

980
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:02,904
You want me to attend Sri Ramanavami
festival, right?

981
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,875
I'll definitely make it.

982
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:10,584
Son of Ramamurthy of
Lakkavaram is here.

983
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:13,481
Ramamurthy's son?
- Yes, he's tall like pole.

984
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:14,712
Let him in.
- Okay.

985
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:22,690
He's that crook.

986
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:28,259
Are you Ramamurthy's son?
I saw you as a little kid.

987
01:10:28,424 --> 01:10:29,425
You were so small.

988
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:31,663
Everyone would be small as a kid.

989
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:40,079
If everyone from India come to you,
how can I find jobs for them?

990
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:44,082
Since you're Ramamurthy's son,

991
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,186
I'll offer you attendaﬂs job, do it.

992
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:48,083
I'm not here for your
lowly job offer.

993
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:51,589
I'm here to take back the money you
looted from dad with interest.

994
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:54,227
So you came here knowing
the flashback, right?

995
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:55,394
I want my money.

996
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:57,963
Nephew, don't get so excited.

997
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:01,590
Though he looks like an actor
working for blue films,

998
01:11:01,724 --> 01:11:04,068
isn't he human? Doesn't he eat food?

999
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:06,331
He'll reform and
return your money.

1000
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,941
He's not a crook as you think.
Isn't it?

1001
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:10,668
Why are you going overboard?

1002
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:12,779
Isn't it true that you cheated my dad?

1003
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:16,777
Your father knows only
to get cheated,

1004
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:20,045
I was there at right time,
so I got that offer.

1005
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:22,621
I'll make you shed blood tears.

1006
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:26,021
Can you make me bleed worse than
what my wife does with me?

1007
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:28,929
I don't want any security.

1008
01:11:29,084 --> 01:11:32,759
He's challenging me,
throw them out.

1009
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:35,925
When did I challenge you?
- Let's go.

1010
01:11:36,091 --> 01:11:37,627
You'll die in my hands.

1011
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:41,036
Fools, he'll throw you out like this.

1012
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:44,803
He usurped my dad's wealth
and insulted me too.

1013
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:46,469
I'll not spare him, uncle.

1014
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:49,343
Don't leave him, nephew,
this is a matter of our honour.

1015
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:50,984
How he insulted us!

1016
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,848
He insulted us,
we must teach him a lesson.

1017
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:55,989
Though I was the senior most

1018
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,887
and you developed company
with your new designs,

1019
01:11:59,048 --> 01:12:00,220
how dare he promotes Alaknanda!

1020
01:12:00,382 --> 01:12:02,384
He didn't even respect
this personality.

1021
01:12:02,518 --> 01:12:04,122
Great injustice!
- Gross injustice.

1022
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:09,133
Had you not backed him. he would
be eking out a like in Dondapadu.

1023
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:10,668
He enjoyed it till now,

1024
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:12,033
for seeking divorce,

1025
01:12:12,194 --> 01:12:13,696
and now wants 50% share in
the wealth, this is disgusting.

1026
01:12:13,862 --> 01:12:15,239
Yes, disgusting.O

1027
01:12:16,598 --> 01:12:18,441
ls it disgusting to
seek comfort in your lap?

1028
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,238
Not that, darling.

1029
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:25,351
Though she may have invested 90%,
didn't you invest 10%?

1030
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:28,021
You made 90 rupees 100!

1031
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:30,350
Will she take 50% of
the wealth for that?

1032
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:34,853
It's a sin!

1033
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:38,021
Forget about sins and good deeds,
we must get back our money.

1034
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:50,309
Business man kidnapped a week ago
was released free today.

1035
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:55,471
Kidnappers freed him after
his family paid the ransom.

1036
01:12:55,637 --> 01:13:02,384
His sons Bruce Lee and Jet Lee
shared their joy of father's return.

1037
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,202
I'll get myself kidnapped,

1038
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:18,099
I'll make everyone believe
it is real kidnap,

1039
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:20,570
I'll demand 50% of the wealth,

1040
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:24,404
at least for public, my wife will
be forced to pay ransom,

1041
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:29,072
after getting the ransom,
I'll go home like an innocent man,

1042
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:32,947
anyway I'll get legally 50% of
the remaining wealth,

1043
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:36,749
I'll get 75% and she'll get 25%.

1044
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:39,893
25% to him and you'll get 75%?
- Yes.

1045
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:41,994
If I get my husband kidnapped,

1046
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:45,155
if I pay 50% of the wealth
to get him released,

1047
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:46,094
let's play a drama.

1048
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:49,065
anyway I'll get 25% of the
remaining wealth, right?

1049
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:50,066
Legally!

1050
01:13:50,225 --> 01:13:52,398
Don't tie my hands with laws, uncle?

1051
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:54,870
It's right to kidnap him
for our money.

1052
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:58,637
It's correct to kidnap him
and recover our dues.

1053
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:00,644
But when, where and how?

1054
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:03,807
Tomorrow! In Telugu Academy's
Sri Ramanavami festival,

1055
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:05,280
he's the chief guest.

1056
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,853
It seems guests will arrive
in mythological get ups.

1057
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:10,456
Nobody can recognise us then.
That's the right place.

1058
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:12,614
That's the right place.

1059
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:15,318
But who is the man who can
kidnap me smoothly,

1060
01:14:15,517 --> 01:14:17,258
a man who isn't known
to anyone there?

1061
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:18,090
Who is he?

1062
01:14:18,253 --> 01:14:20,426
There's a man whom you
too don't know.

1063
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:22,094
My younger brother Birbal.

1064
01:14:25,727 --> 01:14:26,364
There won't be any goof up, right?

1065
01:14:26,562 --> 01:14:27,973
There's no way for goof ups.

1066
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:30,235
My cousin Jimbo will deal it perfectly.

1067
01:14:30,365 --> 01:14:32,811
He's a man who takes
every step carefully.

1068
01:14:35,804 --> 01:14:37,306
That's real punch!

1069
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:39,475
Watch out, Gopalakrishna!

1070
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:40,813
Telugu Academy Sri Ramanavami Festival

1071
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:20,523
How do you I look in
this get up, uncle?

1072
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:24,220
You're like Samarlakota
Lord Anjaneya's idol.

1073
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:25,091
I'll beat you with my tail.

1074
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:27,495
Already behaving like monkey.

1075
01:15:28,223 --> 01:15:29,998
Look there!

1076
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:32,402
For his personality,
Lord Rama's role?

1077
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:34,733
NTR's fans would chase him to death.
- Yes.

1078
01:15:34,897 --> 01:15:36,171
He's safe because it's Bangkok.

1079
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:38,868
Brother, you remember
what I told you, right?

1080
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:43,215
You must kidnap my boss Gopalakrishna.

1081
01:15:43,572 --> 01:15:47,213
Take him carefully to hotel
and look after him well.

1082
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:50,152
Okay sister.
I don't know who your boss is!

1083
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:52,223
He's doing the role of Rama.

1084
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:56,452
Remember well, you must kidnap
the man in Rama's role.

1085
01:15:57,252 --> 01:15:59,698
You know Rama, right?
- I've seen in so many films.

1086
01:15:59,821 --> 01:16:03,132
Rama is strong like me,
carries a mace and squeezes it.

1087
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:05,135
The one who carries mace
is Bheema not Rama.

1088
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:08,241
The man with blue hue
carrying an arrow is Rama.

1089
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:10,843
He's my boss. Got it?
- Okay sister.

1090
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:13,309
Blue hue, carrying arrow.

1091
01:16:15,137 --> 01:16:17,083
Madam, talk to Jimbo.

1092
01:16:19,007 --> 01:16:19,883
Greetings madam.

1093
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:22,044
Are you outside only?
- Outside only, madam.

1094
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:25,589
Will you do it correctly?
- I'll do it, madam.

1095
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:30,386
He's a demon but doing Rama's role.

1096
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:33,323
We mustn't use our original names
till we finish our task.- No!

1097
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:37,026
Yes, you're Lankini,
I'm Shoorpanaka, she's Thataki.

1098
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:39,139
Your get up is super.

1099
01:16:40,195 --> 01:16:42,573
Where's your brother?
- He's ready.

1100
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:55,083
I feel like I've seen you.

1101
01:16:55,243 --> 01:16:57,450
I think you didn't recognise me.
- No.

1102
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:01,288
To recognise me,
I'll give you 3 options.

1103
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:02,428
Okay.

1104
01:17:09,725 --> 01:17:11,102
This is most important.

1105
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:16,135
Oh Appala Raju!

1106
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:19,807
You're an attendar in my office,

1107
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:22,471
how dare you put on equal
role of Krishna with me.

1108
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:25,375
More over giving me options
like Amitabh!

1109
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:29,852
My grandma said I'm the best
as Krishna after NTR.

1110
01:17:30,012 --> 01:17:33,152
Go! Come back as monkey.
Go!

1111
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:36,793
Jealous that I'm handsome than him.
Jealousy man!

1112
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:38,295
Greetings to all!

1113
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:44,297
Great industrialist Gopaiakrishna
coming for today's event,

1114
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:03,053
Blue hue...carrying arrow!
He's Rama!

1115
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:10,662
Can you please smell and tell
what flavour perfume this is?

1116
01:18:16,224 --> 01:18:16,861
Greetings.

1117
01:18:19,961 --> 01:18:22,032
Uncle, come.
- Be careful heads.

1118
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,878
Why hasn't he come yet?

1119
01:18:32,441 --> 01:18:34,978
Remove those heads.

1120
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:38,985
What shall we do now?

1121
01:18:45,987 --> 01:18:47,364
I'm kidnapping You-

1122
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:52,528
Why is he executing our plan?

1123
01:18:52,794 --> 01:18:55,900
Blood, there's competition
in every field.

1124
01:18:56,832 --> 01:18:57,810
Who is he?

1125
01:18:57,966 --> 01:19:01,470
I know that!
Shout loud for people to hear it.

1126
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:04,411
I'll tell myself!

1127
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:08,578
He's kidnapping me!

1128
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:12,923
Point your gun on my neck.

1129
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:15,361
Open the door.

1130
01:19:19,054 --> 01:19:20,055
Come fast!

1131
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:28,732
You kidnapped me perfectly.

1132
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:32,269
Style of holding the gun was great!

1133
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:34,708
Joseph, I'm kidnapped.

1134
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:45,284
Go fast!

1135
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:50,686
What happened?

1136
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:55,124
Don't you know to check car's
condition before kidnapping me?

1137
01:19:55,257 --> 01:19:56,395
Check it.

1138
01:20:07,569 --> 01:20:09,071
Looks like the car is broke down.

1139
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:18,323
What's that? Get into the boot.

1140
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:20,816
Lock the boot.

1141
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:24,625
What's the problem?
Why are you taking so...

1142
01:20:26,788 --> 01:20:29,792
I feel like I've seen
this personality.

1143
01:20:31,726 --> 01:20:33,433
Shoorpanaka, Lankini, come!

1144
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:34,798
Thataki, hold the gun properly.

1145
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:36,566
Who are you?

1146
01:20:36,731 --> 01:20:40,338
We're kidnapping you, sir?

1147
01:20:41,102 --> 01:20:42,581
Already he's here,
why another gang?

1148
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:44,947
I got it.

1149
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:49,111
If there's any hitch in between,
she has arranged a back up,

1150
01:20:49,277 --> 01:20:50,347
that's A
aknanda's plan!

1151
01:20:50,712 --> 01:20:52,851
Come, let's go.

1152
01:20:53,815 --> 01:20:57,991
I thought he would fight, but he's
coming as if going on dating.

1153
01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:59,924
What ever it is, he's coming, right?

1154
01:21:00,088 --> 01:21:02,830
Come fast...come fast.
- Come...come.

1155
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:06,605
Who are these she devils?
They look more terrible than him.

1156
01:21:06,761 --> 01:21:08,206
I know as much as you know.

1157
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:09,671
Do you at least know what to do now?

1158
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:10,832
I'll tell you.
- Come.

1159
01:21:33,188 --> 01:21:34,064
What happened?

1160
01:21:36,491 --> 01:21:38,801
What happened this time?

1161
01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:40,164
Flat tyre, sir.

1162
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:45,311
How many cars do I've to change?

1163
01:21:47,636 --> 01:21:49,479
Flat tyre here.

1164
01:21:49,638 --> 01:21:50,912
That car is fine.

1165
01:21:56,845 --> 01:21:59,189
here the good news yourself, madam.

1166
01:22:00,448 --> 01:22:02,655
ls our plan executed?
- Executed but by others.

1167
01:22:02,817 --> 01:22:03,887
You kidnapped him, right?

1168
01:22:04,052 --> 01:22:07,829
Some others pointed a gun
and took away sir with them.

1169
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:12,330
Where are you calling from?
- From car boot, madam.

1170
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:15,299
I'll get the keys.

1171
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:21,774
Pull it...pull...

1172
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:30,446
Pull it inside.

1173
01:22:37,485 --> 01:22:39,328
Cheap colour may spoil the bed.

1174
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:40,932
He himself is damn cheap.

1175
01:22:41,156 --> 01:22:43,329
Nephew, call his wife.

1176
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:46,268
If she pays quickly, let's have
curd rice and sleep early.

1177
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:47,771
Are we here to sleep early?

1178
01:22:47,929 --> 01:22:49,374
Remove it and speak.

1179
01:22:50,231 --> 01:22:52,108
We must have her phone number
to call her, right?

1180
01:22:52,267 --> 01:22:55,111
Not now, let's find it
by morning and call her.

1181
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:58,479
She'll also be fresh and in mood
to get shocked by our news.

1182
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,244
Let's remove this make up.

1183
01:23:02,911 --> 01:23:04,857
Where am I?
- In a star hotel, sir.

1184
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:08,491
What's this dress?

1185
01:23:08,616 --> 01:23:10,220
I put it on you so that
nobody recognises you.

1186
01:23:10,385 --> 01:23:11,455
Who brought me here?

1187
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:14,793
You're talking as if you
don't know anything, boss.

1188
01:23:14,956 --> 01:23:18,961
It's my duty look after you
like a king, sir.

1189
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:22,274
Who are you anyway?

1190
01:23:24,432 --> 01:23:28,005
Order me for anything you want,
enjoy till you get bored.

1191
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:32,284
Anyway you'd be a king, sir.
- King?

1192
01:23:32,574 --> 01:23:35,020
Someone told me the same dialogue.

1193
01:23:37,112 --> 01:23:43,996
Appi, you'd be a king
in near future.

1194
01:23:44,152 --> 01:23:48,658
Can't say from which direction
luck would hit you.

1195
01:23:48,823 --> 01:23:52,202
men would serve you like servants.

1196
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:56,536
My dear grandma!
Has your word come true like this?

1197
01:23:58,133 --> 01:23:59,510
Are you really my servant?
- Why doubt me, sir?

1198
01:24:00,668 --> 01:24:02,204
You look like a giant demon in dress.

1199
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:05,408
I got a good servant, Tawa.
- I'm Birbal not Tawa.

1200
01:24:05,573 --> 01:24:09,180
Birbal or Herbal,
what ever I call is your name.

1201
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:13,383
I'll take bath, order the most
expensive food and drinks for me.

1202
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:16,956
Why are you staring at me?
I'll pluck out your eyes.

1203
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:19,689
Move! I'm the king!

1204
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:32,637
Why are you looking at me?
Go out, you may cast evil eye on me.

1205
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:33,404
Go!

1206
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:39,074
Sister, I kidnapped your boss
as you told me,

1207
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,914
I'm keeping him in room no:109
in Hotel Radisson.

1208
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:44,216
But he's behaving differently, sister.

1209
01:24:44,379 --> 01:24:50,261
He's a golden goose.
Look after him like a king.

1210
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:53,058
He thinks we're acting
according to his script.

1211
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:55,530
But he doesn't we've our
own screenplay.

1212
01:24:55,690 --> 01:24:59,399
Don't know why I feel like
killing him with my head!

1213
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:02,167
Once his wife pays ransom,

1214
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:06,278
I don't mind what so ever
you may do with him.

1215
01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:08,846
Let's go to Dubai after
you're done with him.

1216
01:25:09,003 --> 01:25:11,244
Till then don't use
a harsh word against him.

1217
01:25:11,406 --> 01:25:13,443
Do whatever he asks you.

1218
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:14,480
Give the phone to him.

1219
01:25:14,642 --> 01:25:15,450
Phone!

1220
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:16,782
Sister!

1221
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:19,118
Your sister?
- I mean your secretary.

1222
01:25:20,215 --> 01:25:23,025
This is what you call luck to get
a secretary on getting rich.

1223
01:25:23,184 --> 01:25:25,061
ls everything okay, boss?

1224
01:25:26,521 --> 01:25:28,933
ls my brother looking...
- I'm very busy.

1225
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:31,400
Skinhead is looking after me well,
cut the call.

1226
01:25:32,026 --> 01:25:33,630
Looks like he's fully drunk.

1227
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:36,742
Why are you watching like watch tower?
Who will squeeze it?

1228
01:25:36,865 --> 01:25:37,468
What?

1229
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:39,043
My body and legs.

1230
01:25:42,904 --> 01:25:45,475
Do it slowly.

1231
01:25:47,509 --> 01:25:55,018
Famous industrialist Goapalakrishna
has been kidnapped last night.

1232
01:25:55,150 --> 01:26:01,624
Indian Association has criticized
for failing to give security.

1233
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:04,227
Our officer is dumb.

1234
01:26:04,392 --> 01:26:08,499
There's only one man who is responsible
for any kidnap in Bangkok,

1235
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:11,439
he doesn't know it is
Kidnap King Thota!

1236
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:28,059
What's this month's collection?
- Total 72 lakh bahts.

1237
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:30,356
How many kidnaps?
- 14.

1238
01:26:30,518 --> 01:26:33,158
ls this the way do business?
- ls this the way to do business?

1239
01:26:33,354 --> 01:26:34,833
Don't you've shame?
- Don't you've shame?

1240
01:26:36,424 --> 01:26:38,870
What's this?
Just 14 kidnaps only.

1241
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,404
That too small cases.

1242
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:43,099
We're providing so many
facilities to victims,

1243
01:26:43,298 --> 01:26:45,005
we're maintaining so many cottages,

1244
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,407
maitainance cost has grown
and income has come down.

1245
01:26:47,569 --> 01:26:48,547
What's happening here?

1246
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:50,979
Ups and downs are unavoidable
to powerful Dons also.

1247
01:26:51,139 --> 01:26:52,049
Shut up!

1248
01:26:52,273 --> 01:26:55,618
You eat like gargantuan and
take home hefty salaries.

1249
01:26:55,777 --> 01:26:58,053
Performance is nil.
- It seems performance is nil.

1250
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:00,819
Look after the counters.

1251
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:04,928
He's eating our brain though
he can't utter all words,

1252
01:27:05,086 --> 01:27:08,499
if he can speak well all words,
we can't tolerate him.

1253
01:27:09,958 --> 01:27:11,164
Go to counter 2.

1254
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:13,561
What's the name?
- Kamineni Kameshwara Rao.

1255
01:27:13,728 --> 01:27:14,729
Age 60 years.

1256
01:27:16,631 --> 01:27:19,134
He was kidnapped on 4th.
- Yes sir.

1257
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:20,074
MY father, sir.

1258
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:22,772
Did you get time now
to free your father?

1259
01:27:22,937 --> 01:27:23,915
Managed to get money now only.

1260
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:26,416
Show this in counter 2 and pay up.

1261
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:27,575
Any discount?

1262
01:27:27,742 --> 01:27:30,348
Discount is only in peak time,
not in usual time.

1263
01:27:30,511 --> 01:27:31,182
Give!

1264
01:27:31,613 --> 01:27:34,856
Go to counter 3 and take delivery.
Go!

1265
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:36,156
Come.

1266
01:27:37,752 --> 01:27:38,492
Pay Rs.4.4 lakhs.

1267
01:27:38,653 --> 01:27:40,394
You demanded Rs.4 lakhs only
when you kidnapped him, right?

1268
01:27:40,521 --> 01:27:42,865
We spent Rs.40000 for
maintaining your father.

1269
01:27:43,024 --> 01:27:44,901
Your father takes bath only
with hot water.

1270
01:27:45,059 --> 01:27:47,096
He'll not sleep without
Thai massage every night.

1271
01:27:47,295 --> 01:27:49,536
All other expenses are in
this slip, check it.

1272
01:27:50,064 --> 01:27:52,044
What's this, sir?
Condom expenses too!

1273
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:54,271
Your father used it,
he's still quite virile.

1274
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:57,279
Go to counter 3 and take delivery.
Go!

1275
01:27:57,438 --> 01:27:59,111
Here also!

1276
01:28:02,243 --> 01:28:04,223
Your son is here to take you, come.

1277
01:28:04,379 --> 01:28:06,154
Son! Have you come?

1278
01:28:06,314 --> 01:28:07,952
I was waiting for you.
- Father.

1279
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:09,993
Son...girl!

1280
01:28:12,854 --> 01:28:16,666
Kidnap? Kidnap in my area
without my knowledge!

1281
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:18,327
Isn't it you who kidnapped him?

1282
01:28:18,493 --> 01:28:22,100
We came happily for our cut
hearing about VIP's kidnap.

1283
01:28:22,263 --> 01:28:22,968
Fizzled out.

1284
01:28:23,097 --> 01:28:25,873
I was wondering why my business
was going down,

1285
01:28:26,034 --> 01:28:29,174
someone has opened a shop
to compete with me.

1286
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:39,585
Even professional kidnappers
won't do it so sincerely.

1287
01:28:43,851 --> 01:28:47,230
You didn't get nervous while kidnapping,
why are you nervous now?

1288
01:28:48,189 --> 01:28:51,796
Anyway the kidnap act
went off very well.

1289
01:28:53,961 --> 01:28:56,601
You appear like real kidnappers.

1290
01:28:57,865 --> 01:28:58,900
Who is he?
- He is...

1291
01:28:59,067 --> 01:29:01,172
Your assistant?

1292
01:29:02,103 --> 01:29:03,514
He has a good quality,

1293
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:05,446
he asks a question and
answers it himself.

1294
01:29:05,606 --> 01:29:07,552
What are you murmuring?

1295
01:29:07,709 --> 01:29:09,086
Order a good coffee.

1296
01:29:09,944 --> 01:29:12,185
I'll freshen up.

1297
01:29:12,447 --> 01:29:13,824
He has diabetes too.

1298
01:29:13,981 --> 01:29:17,519
Why is he behaving like this without
worrying about getting kidnapped?

1299
01:29:17,685 --> 01:29:23,158
I think chloroform has made
him forget everything.

1300
01:29:23,324 --> 01:29:26,794
It's good for us to encourage
him without fighting.

1301
01:29:26,961 --> 01:29:29,100
Order a pot of coffee.

1302
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:38,707
Did you have it?
- We don't drink early morning.

1303
01:29:39,107 --> 01:29:42,316
Did you call my wife to demand ransom?

1304
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:45,714
Not yet.
- Why?

1305
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:47,553
No balance in my phone.

1306
01:29:47,715 --> 01:29:50,525
Even if you have
will you call from this phone?

1307
01:29:50,785 --> 01:29:53,197
Police would tap the call.
My fate!

1308
01:29:53,354 --> 01:29:55,732
Buy a new SIM card and call from it.

1309
01:29:56,290 --> 01:29:57,860
He's clever.

1310
01:29:58,025 --> 01:30:00,733
My life's dictionary has
no place for word slow.

1311
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:02,636
Why didn't you check before buying it?

1312
01:30:02,797 --> 01:30:05,937
Go...buy a new SIM, go!

1313
01:30:09,971 --> 01:30:13,441
What's this? I'm asking address
and you're saying something.

1314
01:30:13,608 --> 01:30:16,145
Watch out! I'll find the
address in 1 hour.

1315
01:30:18,179 --> 01:30:22,355
Great Bangkok! We've seen it in
so many of Puri Jagannadh's films.

1316
01:30:23,651 --> 01:30:26,894
I came in airbus not in red bus.

1317
01:30:27,889 --> 01:30:30,665
It's love magic, any girl would
appear like Mahalakshmi.

1318
01:30:30,825 --> 01:30:36,867
Would I tell my name is Mahalakshmi
and I'm coming from Hyderabad.

1319
01:30:37,031 --> 01:30:38,601
She's my lover only!

1320
01:30:40,201 --> 01:30:40,804
Who are you?

1321
01:30:40,968 --> 01:30:43,209
How dare you hold a girl's hand
though it's Bangkok.

1322
01:30:43,371 --> 01:30:44,372
I'm fire!

1323
01:30:44,539 --> 01:30:46,610
You foolish girl, it's me!

1324
01:30:47,642 --> 01:30:50,714
How come you're here?
What happened?

1325
01:30:50,978 --> 01:30:53,618
I beg you! Leave me.
- Tie him up.

1326
01:30:53,781 --> 01:30:57,194
I beg you Seth, please leave him.

1327
01:30:57,351 --> 01:31:00,594
Please leave me at least
for her tears.

1328
01:31:00,721 --> 01:31:03,258
I'm on a vow of prayer for
the welfare of husband.

1329
01:31:03,424 --> 01:31:07,804
It'll be over on coming Friday.
If you want take him on Saturday.

1330
01:31:08,062 --> 01:31:10,201
Am I taking him away to kill?

1331
01:31:10,364 --> 01:31:13,402
I'm going to take his kidneys
as per the agreement.

1332
01:31:13,568 --> 01:31:19,177
Why are you saying so simply
as taking a plate of idlies?

1333
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:21,081
Boys, take him away.

1334
01:31:21,642 --> 01:31:24,316
Please leave my daddy, Seth.

1335
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:27,983
Give me one month's time,
I'll settle your loan.

1336
01:31:28,216 --> 01:31:29,820
Consider me as your daughter, Seth.

1337
01:31:29,984 --> 01:31:32,897
You hit me with daughter's sentiment.

1338
01:31:33,054 --> 01:31:36,524
I'm giving you one month's time for you.

1339
01:31:36,691 --> 01:31:39,069
If you fail to pay after a month,

1340
01:31:39,227 --> 01:31:43,004
I'll take pluck one eye for
interest along with kidneys.

1341
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:44,609
You're the surety.

1342
01:31:45,299 --> 01:31:47,370
Untie him, boys.

1343
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:51,173
Pack my clothes.
- Are you going to wash it?

1344
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:54,252
Neither to wash nor to dry it.
I'm going to Bangkok.

1345
01:31:54,408 --> 01:31:56,888
If you want money,
people go to bank, why Bangkok?

1346
01:31:57,044 --> 01:32:00,218
Would I tell you that there's heroine
behind every successful hero?

1347
01:32:00,381 --> 01:32:02,224
Would I tell that I'm behind Buchi?

1348
01:32:02,383 --> 01:32:05,489
Would I tell you that I'll come
back from Bangkok with money only?

1349
01:32:05,686 --> 01:32:09,224
Don't tell me but
do come back with money.

1350
01:32:10,925 --> 01:32:14,498
Till I'm there no need to fear
about your dad's kidneys and eyes.

1351
01:32:14,695 --> 01:32:16,197
Will you donate your kidneys and eyes?

1352
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:17,502
Would you take if I offer?

1353
01:32:17,999 --> 01:32:21,879
Not that cheque is ready in room,
we've to encash it, that's all.

1354
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:23,540
I know you Buchi!

1355
01:32:23,704 --> 01:32:26,150
If you throw a challenge,
you're a winner!

1356
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:54,771
my beautiful fair lady,
I saw you...

1357
01:32:54,936 --> 01:33:00,409
I wish to be a mole
on your fair cheek...

1358
01:33:14,922 --> 01:33:19,803
O my handsome tattoo!
You're after me...

1359
01:33:19,961 --> 01:33:24,103
I'll consider you as turmeric paste...

1360
01:33:44,986 --> 01:33:50,595
I'll come as white jasmine....
I'll stay on dark rain...

1361
01:33:54,962 --> 01:33:57,670
If you call I'll come as love bird...

1362
01:33:57,832 --> 01:34:00,108
If you say no I'll stay on honey comb...

1363
01:34:00,267 --> 01:34:04,841
May I use my kohl and put a mark
under your feet to ward off evil...

1364
01:34:05,006 --> 01:34:12,151
Don't vanish after teasing me
and raking up desires...

1365
01:34:47,448 --> 01:34:50,122
May I come unbridled horse...

1366
01:34:50,284 --> 01:34:53,163
May I close the door and
settle in your arms...

1367
01:34:57,725 --> 01:35:00,103
May I cover myself with you...

1368
01:35:00,227 --> 01:35:02,798
May I take you to bliss...

1369
01:35:02,963 --> 01:35:07,378
I'll charm you and
take you to heaven...

1370
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:13,884
If you make me the king of
your nights I'll rule over it...

1371
01:35:26,887 --> 01:35:28,889
Uncle, look who is here!

1372
01:35:30,091 --> 01:35:32,196
You get up, you take rest.

1373
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,904
Who is she?
- Do you need to know? Get up!

1374
01:35:35,062 --> 01:35:40,239
What's this? You're involving too
many people in the operation.

1375
01:35:40,401 --> 01:35:42,847
Should I take your permission
for the operation?

1376
01:35:43,003 --> 01:35:43,913
Who is he?

1377
01:35:44,071 --> 01:35:47,541
You said cheque is ready,
just have to encash, I got it.

1378
01:35:47,708 --> 01:35:50,484
You'll sell his kidneys
to save my father, right?

1379
01:35:50,644 --> 01:35:53,523
His body parts are damaged
with jealous and betrayals.

1380
01:35:53,681 --> 01:35:54,455
We don't need them.

1381
01:35:54,615 --> 01:35:56,720
What nonsense are you talking?

1382
01:35:56,884 --> 01:35:58,625
I'll tell your sister
about you, be careful.

1383
01:35:58,819 --> 01:36:02,961
No...no...
please don't call my sister.

1384
01:36:03,090 --> 01:36:04,592
To hell with my sister!

1385
01:36:04,792 --> 01:36:06,567
Do you think I'll wet my pant
on hearing sister's name?

1386
01:36:06,727 --> 01:36:07,899
Who is my sister anyway?

1387
01:36:08,062 --> 01:36:10,201
Aren't you A
aknanda's sister?

1388
01:36:10,364 --> 01:36:12,435
I'm A
aknanda's younger brother
or Anushka's elder brother.

1389
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,978
You're Ramamurhty's son, right?
- Yes.

1390
01:36:15,136 --> 01:36:17,810
I too don't need this,
you can use it.

1391
01:36:17,972 --> 01:36:21,943
I'll leave you only after I get back
my dad's wealth along with interest.

1392
01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:23,782
Am I really kidnapped?

1393
01:36:23,944 --> 01:36:26,151
Any doubt you fool?

1394
01:36:26,313 --> 01:36:30,090
Then, I'll escape!
- Catch him!

1395
01:36:30,251 --> 01:36:32,959
Where will you escape?

1396
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:39,969
Would dead men become ghosts?

1397
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:09,000
Nephew! Villain is escaping!

1398
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:12,095
Go silently to sleep.

1399
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:14,564
Catch him, uncle.

1400
01:37:14,728 --> 01:37:17,174
Why are you playing at midnight?
Go to sleep.

1401
01:37:17,331 --> 01:37:19,902
Not playing games,
he's escaping, catch him.

1402
01:37:21,202 --> 01:37:23,011
Go inside.
- Catch him.

1403
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:24,843
He's running around.

1404
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:28,176
He shut the door.

1405
01:37:35,316 --> 01:37:37,592
Did you make him smell
chloroform or doused him?

1406
01:37:37,751 --> 01:37:40,061
If dose increases, he'll die.
- ls it?

1407
01:37:40,187 --> 01:37:44,033
ls he sleeping or dead?

1408
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:47,471
He's dead.

1409
01:37:49,029 --> 01:37:51,839
Did I kill a man with my hands?

1410
01:37:52,032 --> 01:37:57,243
I read just now that dead men come
back as ghosts to take revenge.

1411
01:38:01,575 --> 01:38:02,883
ls it hot?

1412
01:38:04,411 --> 01:38:08,587
He won't come back alive even if you
give a Kama
hasan's performance.

1413
01:38:08,749 --> 01:38:10,251
Think about what to do with
this dead body!

1414
01:38:10,417 --> 01:38:14,194
OPeople may get doubt
if we take body in a bag.

1415
01:38:14,421 --> 01:38:17,527
Stay here, I'll check
the position outside.

1416
01:38:17,691 --> 01:38:18,795
Be careful.

1417
01:38:42,883 --> 01:38:44,260
ls the body smelling so quickly?

1418
01:38:44,418 --> 01:38:46,329
Not from the body but from you.

1419
01:38:46,487 --> 01:38:49,400
Uncle, police are here.

1420
01:38:50,724 --> 01:38:52,032
Do they already know about the murder?

1421
01:38:52,192 --> 01:38:54,399
Whatever it is we mustn't
stay here, let's go away.

1422
01:38:54,528 --> 01:38:56,337
Let's try getting out from there.

1423
01:39:01,669 --> 01:39:04,115
Police here also...go...go...

1424
01:39:06,106 --> 01:39:09,315
Stay here, I'll check if there's
any way from backside.

1425
01:39:33,133 --> 01:39:34,908
Why hasn't he come back yet?

1426
01:40:11,171 --> 01:40:14,277
Did he wantonly beat me or
unwittingly beat me?

1427
01:40:17,811 --> 01:40:18,619
Where are they?

1428
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:20,189
Where did they go away?

1429
01:41:21,975 --> 01:41:24,353
No, I didn't kill you wantonly.

1430
01:41:41,028 --> 01:41:42,166
Ghost!

1431
01:41:49,303 --> 01:41:50,043
Where's the lock?

1432
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:56,850
It's here.

1433
01:42:09,323 --> 01:42:13,032
It's not me!
I killed you by accident.

1434
01:42:13,293 --> 01:42:14,931
No please!

1435
01:42:32,479 --> 01:42:33,651
Ghost!

1436
01:42:37,618 --> 01:42:38,824
Where were you, nephew?

1437
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:39,555
Are you here?

1438
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:42,030
That villain has become ghost
and is trying to kill me.

1439
01:42:43,357 --> 01:42:44,495
I almost died in shock.

1440
01:42:45,592 --> 01:42:47,970
Am I a ghost?
- Are you alive?

1441
01:42:48,228 --> 01:42:49,764
He's alive.

1442
01:42:50,197 --> 01:42:53,508
I'm a sleep walker.
- Thank God, we're saved.

1443
01:42:57,471 --> 01:42:59,348
Wasn't the police man after us?

1444
01:43:06,513 --> 01:43:08,254
Where are you Gopi?

1445
01:43:08,415 --> 01:43:09,655
What control?

1446
01:43:09,816 --> 01:43:12,160
ls it your husband
who has been kidnapped?

1447
01:43:12,319 --> 01:43:13,923
He's my husband.

1448
01:43:14,087 --> 01:43:17,398
You didn't find a clue even after
he has been kidnapped for 24 hours.

1449
01:43:17,558 --> 01:43:18,901
What Bangkok police is doing?

1450
01:43:19,059 --> 01:43:21,061
We're trying, madam.

1451
01:43:21,261 --> 01:43:25,607
I suspect the kidnappers
may be close to you.

1452
01:43:25,999 --> 01:43:28,206
I'll find the truth.

1453
01:43:28,368 --> 01:43:31,508
I don't know what you do,
I want my husband, that's all.

1454
01:43:31,672 --> 01:43:34,983
I f kidnappers call you,
inform us immediately.

1455
01:43:35,142 --> 01:43:37,418
Please be brave.

1456
01:43:37,578 --> 01:43:40,115
No need to e brave or anything,
please leave me alone.

1457
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:41,486
I'm struggling to cry.

1458
01:43:42,816 --> 01:43:44,022
Bye madam.

1459
01:43:47,187 --> 01:43:49,667
I suspect her character.

1460
01:43:49,823 --> 01:43:51,803
She's not like that sir.

1461
01:43:51,959 --> 01:43:53,632
I didn't mean like that.

1462
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:57,936
She wants divorce from him,
why is she overacting so much?

1463
01:43:58,065 --> 01:43:59,908
Anyway keep an eye on her.

1464
01:44:00,067 --> 01:44:02,240
Okay sir, I'll stay back here
to keep an eye on her.

1465
01:44:02,402 --> 01:44:05,246
No need, my eyes are bigger
than yours.

1466
01:44:05,973 --> 01:44:09,182
Nephew, the time is here,
make a phone call.

1467
01:44:09,576 --> 01:44:10,987
Tell me house number.

1468
01:44:15,182 --> 01:44:15,922
That's door number.

1469
01:44:16,083 --> 01:44:19,326
We asked residence phone number.

1470
01:44:25,359 --> 01:44:27,999
Who are you stupid?
Are you laughing or coughing?

1471
01:44:28,161 --> 01:44:31,973
Both are same for me,
my boss will talk to you now.

1472
01:44:32,099 --> 01:44:33,942
Boss? Who the hell are you, idiot?

1473
01:44:34,101 --> 01:44:36,775
I'm the Don of this city.

1474
01:44:36,937 --> 01:44:39,110
If you call yourself as Don of city,
as your boss,

1475
01:44:39,273 --> 01:44:42,152
what should I tell her now?
- What should you tell?

1476
01:44:43,210 --> 01:44:44,348
Say Don 2!

1477
01:44:44,511 --> 01:44:46,115
I thought she's foolish but not.

1478
01:44:49,916 --> 01:44:50,587
What do you want?

1479
01:44:50,751 --> 01:44:53,163
Your husband Gopalakrishna...
- He's not here.

1480
01:44:53,353 --> 01:44:54,855
He's away after getting kidnapped.

1481
01:44:55,022 --> 01:44:57,263
If he comes back alive,
call him then.

1482
01:44:57,457 --> 01:44:59,027
Don't you want your husband alive?

1483
01:44:59,192 --> 01:45:00,500
Do you want him?

1484
01:45:00,661 --> 01:45:03,608
We too don't want him.
That's why we called you.

1485
01:45:03,764 --> 01:45:05,903
We kidnapped your husband.

1486
01:45:07,367 --> 01:45:09,574
How can I believe that he's with you?

1487
01:45:09,736 --> 01:45:13,309
Believe...we'll tell his
identification, listen...

1488
01:45:14,474 --> 01:45:16,249
He looks like ear cleaner.

1489
01:45:17,077 --> 01:45:19,318
He looks like a harmonium repairer.

1490
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:21,325
He looks like a zoo feeder.

1491
01:45:21,481 --> 01:45:23,256
He looks like a thief
stealing phenol from toilets.

1492
01:45:23,383 --> 01:45:25,954
Talk to your husband.
Talk to her.

1493
01:45:26,119 --> 01:45:29,191
I'll not talk to that
Kanchukatla lady!

1494
01:45:29,423 --> 01:45:32,768
Your husband says he'll not talk
to that Kanchukatla lady.

1495
01:45:32,893 --> 01:45:35,931
Then, he's my husband.
-You believe us, right?

1496
01:45:36,129 --> 01:45:39,599
If you want your husband alive,
you must pay ransom demand.

1497
01:45:39,766 --> 01:45:40,767
If not...

1498
01:45:42,069 --> 01:45:42,911
Tell me your demand.

1499
01:45:43,070 --> 01:45:44,981
How much...

1500
01:45:45,172 --> 01:45:46,048
How much are you planning to demand?

1501
01:45:46,206 --> 01:45:49,551
I'll demand Rs.5 crores.
- Rs.5 crores only?

1502
01:45:49,710 --> 01:45:51,690
Not a penny less!

1503
01:45:53,313 --> 01:45:57,887
Why kidnap me for Rs.5 crores?
You shou
d've kidnapped my driver.

1504
01:45:58,051 --> 01:46:00,463
If this news leaks out in market,
my image will take a beating.

1505
01:46:00,587 --> 01:46:02,294
Should we ask Rs.50 crores?

1506
01:46:03,924 --> 01:46:07,531
Ask Rs.50 crores,
- 50...crores!

1507
01:46:09,696 --> 01:46:10,697
What happened?

1508
01:46:10,864 --> 01:46:14,107
Won't the boy faint
if you tell such big amount?

1509
01:46:15,969 --> 01:46:17,812
Who sprinkled water
on my face now?

1510
01:46:17,971 --> 01:46:20,212
You?
- No, I sneezed.

1511
01:46:21,842 --> 01:46:27,087
Ask Rs.50 crores.
You take Rs.10 crores instead of 5.

1512
01:46:27,247 --> 01:46:28,988
Give me Rs.40 crores.

1513
01:46:29,649 --> 01:46:30,627
Rs. 1 O crores?

1514
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:33,355
I'll cooperate with you.

1515
01:46:35,956 --> 01:46:37,230
Come here.
- What uncle?

1516
01:46:37,424 --> 01:46:39,563
It's his money,
let him take whatever it is.

1517
01:46:39,726 --> 01:46:42,206
All we need is our money only,
make the demand.

1518
01:46:42,362 --> 01:46:43,067
Hold this.

1519
01:46:43,930 --> 01:46:45,568
Switch on the speaker.

1520
01:46:47,734 --> 01:46:51,079
Are you kidnappers? How much time
will you take to make demand?

1521
01:46:51,738 --> 01:46:54,685
Tell her...tell her...
- You wait man!

1522
01:46:54,841 --> 01:46:56,582
He's still shivering.

1523
01:46:56,743 --> 01:46:59,019
Ask her.
- We demand Rs.50 crores, that's it.

1524
01:46:59,179 --> 01:47:00,283
What are you asking?

1525
01:47:00,447 --> 01:47:03,951
Did I demand too much?
Prices have shot up recently.

1526
01:47:04,117 --> 01:47:06,097
Tell me how much you can give.

1527
01:47:06,253 --> 01:47:11,601
Come away from my husband,
I want to tell you something.

1528
01:47:11,758 --> 01:47:12,793
Okay.

1529
01:47:12,959 --> 01:47:14,836
What's this like Pavan Kalyan
of film 'Thammudu'?

1530
01:47:15,061 --> 01:47:16,506
I've very far, please tell me now.

1531
01:47:16,663 --> 01:47:22,272
Though my husband is useless fellow,
will you demand just Rs.50 crores only?

1532
01:47:23,303 --> 01:47:27,615
Take Rs.75 crores!
- Rs.75 crores...?

1533
01:47:28,041 --> 01:47:29,213
Control yourself,
I can't sneeze now.

1534
01:47:29,376 --> 01:47:35,520
But take Rs.50 crores and
return Rs.25 crores to me.

1535
01:47:35,682 --> 01:47:36,626
Secretly.

1536
01:47:36,783 --> 01:47:41,061
Keep this secret from
my useless husband.

1537
01:47:42,923 --> 01:47:47,963
Get ready the cash, I'll call
back to tell where and when!

1538
01:47:48,395 --> 01:47:50,534
Hey you cunning Kannamba!

1539
01:47:51,198 --> 01:47:52,370
What a family!

1540
01:47:52,566 --> 01:47:54,068
Will you pay Rs.50 crores to kidnappers?

1541
01:47:54,234 --> 01:47:59,308
I'll pay and then steal it from them.

1542
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:01,685
Why should we stay in hotel?

1543
01:48:01,842 --> 01:48:05,016
Police are snooping,
they may suspect us too.

1544
01:48:05,178 --> 01:48:06,418
We didn't kidnap him, right?

1545
01:48:06,580 --> 01:48:08,582
Someone did it before us
and another man later.

1546
01:48:08,748 --> 01:48:11,228
Whether the first man or second
man gets caught, we too get caught.

1547
01:48:11,384 --> 01:48:15,662
Till it is clear safe to stay
here and we know the things.

1548
01:48:15,822 --> 01:48:17,199
That's 107!

1549
01:48:25,832 --> 01:48:27,834
I'll fresh up.
- Go.

1550
01:48:29,836 --> 01:48:32,510
That's not bathroom door, it's here.

1551
01:48:32,672 --> 01:48:35,846
What's this door?
- Connecting door to next room.

1552
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:37,784
What's this?

1553
01:48:37,944 --> 01:48:39,787
Bangkok city tourist map.
- Why?

1554
01:48:39,946 --> 01:48:44,019
I'm finding a lonely place away from
city to escape after getting money.

1555
01:48:45,619 --> 01:48:47,360
Will you tell the amount
and decide the place too?

1556
01:48:47,554 --> 01:48:48,931
ls it you who got kidnapped or we?

1557
01:48:49,089 --> 01:48:50,500
Leave him alone.

1558
01:48:50,690 --> 01:48:56,197
1 Select a good place, nobody must
come there by mistake also.

1559
01:48:56,329 --> 01:48:57,706
Including police.

1560
01:48:58,732 --> 01:49:01,144
They are here.
- Who?- Police!- Police?

1561
01:49:04,170 --> 01:49:06,878
Hey you!
- Police may be here for me.

1562
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:08,542
What shall we do with him now?

1563
01:49:08,808 --> 01:49:11,152
Hide him?
- How?- Like this!

1564
01:49:11,311 --> 01:49:12,483
Close your nose.

1565
01:49:15,715 --> 01:49:16,420
No.

1566
01:49:16,783 --> 01:49:18,194
Let me see the view around.

1567
01:49:20,420 --> 01:49:22,900
Police are here.
- Police?

1568
01:49:23,323 --> 01:49:23,960
Look!

1569
01:49:24,090 --> 01:49:24,727
Be careful.

1570
01:49:25,025 --> 01:49:27,301
We packed him in bag,
where shall we keep the bag?

1571
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:30,873
There's a connecting door to this room.
- If so?

1572
01:49:31,031 --> 01:49:32,203
Come, I'll tell you.

1573
01:49:37,337 --> 01:49:39,510
Police are checking the rooms.

1574
01:49:39,673 --> 01:49:41,516
I think they know we're here.

1575
01:49:42,008 --> 01:49:42,713
Come with me.

1576
01:49:42,876 --> 01:49:45,356
Let's request them and
keep the bag there.

1577
01:49:45,512 --> 01:49:46,320
Knock the door.

1578
01:49:49,082 --> 01:49:50,288
The door is getting knocked
without me doing it.

1579
01:49:50,450 --> 01:49:52,054
Somebody is knocking from other side.
Open the door.

1580
01:49:54,187 --> 01:49:55,393
Who are you?
- Move...move...

1581
01:49:55,555 --> 01:49:56,556
Lorry hit me!

1582
01:49:57,223 --> 01:49:57,860
What to do now?

1583
01:49:57,991 --> 01:50:00,062
Why did you push your way
like wild cattle?

1584
01:50:00,193 --> 01:50:02,230
We need a small help, please.

1585
01:50:02,395 --> 01:50:04,636
We're waiting for someone
to help us.

1586
01:50:04,798 --> 01:50:05,799
What's that?

1587
01:50:05,966 --> 01:50:08,105
Her family is forcing marriage on her.

1588
01:50:08,268 --> 01:50:11,943
No need to tell anything,
she loves another man.

1589
01:50:12,105 --> 01:50:14,449
Her family didn't agree,
so you ran away from home.

1590
01:50:14,608 --> 01:50:16,451
That's all, isn't it?
- Groom should be one on run.

1591
01:50:16,610 --> 01:50:19,090
She created the story
without waiting for us.

1592
01:50:19,245 --> 01:50:21,282
Police are here,
we suspect they're here for us.

1593
01:50:21,448 --> 01:50:22,688
We too have the same doubt.

1594
01:50:22,849 --> 01:50:24,419
I mean they could be here for you.

1595
01:50:24,584 --> 01:50:27,929
We'll stay in your room till
they finish checking our room.

1596
01:50:28,088 --> 01:50:30,193
You can stay by all means.

1597
01:50:30,357 --> 01:50:32,132
You must also do one thing.
- What?

1598
01:50:32,292 --> 01:50:35,739
When police check our room,
you must hide the bag in your room.

1599
01:50:35,895 --> 01:50:38,375
If you agree for this exchange
offer, you can stay here.

1600
01:50:48,575 --> 01:50:49,576
They're in the next room.

1601
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:55,223
I think police are coming
to this room.

1602
01:50:55,382 --> 01:50:57,623
You go to your room.
- Come.- Go!

1603
01:50:57,984 --> 01:50:58,962
Carry it.

1604
01:50:59,119 --> 01:50:59,790
Go inside.

1605
01:50:59,986 --> 01:51:01,556
Take the bag.

1606
01:51:10,630 --> 01:51:11,472
I'll see.

1607
01:51:13,566 --> 01:51:14,601
Whom do you want sir?

1608
01:51:16,169 --> 01:51:16,840
Who are you?

1609
01:51:18,371 --> 01:51:19,042
What's this?

1610
01:51:19,205 --> 01:51:21,116
You're barging into the room
without telling anything.

1611
01:51:21,274 --> 01:51:23,982
You hurt our sentiments,
we'll approach Human Rights commission.

1612
01:51:24,144 --> 01:51:26,249
Are you Telugu people?
- Will you spare us?

1613
01:51:26,413 --> 01:51:29,485
A big industrialist has been
kidnapped in this city.

1614
01:51:29,649 --> 01:51:30,992
We're searching.

1615
01:51:31,251 --> 01:51:32,821
Why are you laughing?

1616
01:51:32,986 --> 01:51:38,197
Would I tell that you won't
find him in this room?

1617
01:51:38,358 --> 01:51:41,999
She's saying there's no one
else other we three.

1618
01:51:42,128 --> 01:51:44,506
What do you do?
- I'll have lunch after an hour.

1619
01:51:44,664 --> 01:51:47,873
Not lunch, he's a magician
and we're his assistants.

1620
01:51:48,101 --> 01:51:49,910
ls he a magician?
How can I believe it?

1621
01:51:50,070 --> 01:51:51,549
ls it?

1622
01:51:53,973 --> 01:51:57,045
Though you're not wearing pant,
you believe you're wearing, right?

1623
01:51:57,210 --> 01:51:59,315
Am I not wearing pant?

1624
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:02,050
Where's my pant?

1625
01:52:05,051 --> 01:52:07,361
See now, you're wearing a pant.

1626
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:08,191
It's there!

1627
01:52:08,354 --> 01:52:09,594
You believe me now?
- Yes.

1628
01:52:09,789 --> 01:52:10,699
You can go now.
- Okay.

1629
01:52:10,890 --> 01:52:11,925
Would they stay back here only?

1630
01:52:12,092 --> 01:52:14,629
Nobody is here.

1631
01:52:15,595 --> 01:52:19,236
We got scared of police,
but why were they afraid?

1632
01:52:19,399 --> 01:52:21,401
What's in this box?

1633
01:52:21,668 --> 01:52:25,206
Why did they hide it here
fearing police?

1634
01:52:25,371 --> 01:52:26,679
Let's see what's in it!

1635
01:52:33,980 --> 01:52:35,425
Boss in the box!

1636
01:52:38,351 --> 01:52:39,455
He's alive!

1637
01:52:39,619 --> 01:52:42,065
They were the kidnappers
who took boss from us.

1638
01:52:42,288 --> 01:52:44,097
Let's take away the bag
immediately from here.

1639
01:52:44,224 --> 01:52:46,226
Close it, quick!

1640
01:52:47,727 --> 01:52:48,467
Excuse me...

1641
01:52:50,964 --> 01:52:52,841
No need to take trouble,
give it to us.

1642
01:52:53,199 --> 01:52:55,679
Thanks for watching.
- We didn't see anything.

1643
01:52:55,835 --> 01:52:59,373
I didn't mean inside
but keeping watch on it.

1644
01:52:59,739 --> 01:53:02,049
Be careful!
- Take it.

1645
01:53:02,609 --> 01:53:04,555
Fast...turn it up!

1646
01:53:04,711 --> 01:53:08,181
He was wearing suit
but now in suitcase.

1647
01:53:10,750 --> 01:53:13,094
What did you put inside?
- Microphone.

1648
01:53:13,253 --> 01:53:15,324
Didn't you see film 'Manmadhudu'?
- I saw!

1649
01:53:15,488 --> 01:53:18,162
We can hear anything
they speak there.

1650
01:53:18,258 --> 01:53:20,135
Let's kidnap when time comes.

1651
01:53:21,394 --> 01:53:24,102
I'm getting bored to drink alone.

1652
01:53:24,264 --> 01:53:27,575
You must also have drinks with me.

1653
01:53:27,700 --> 01:53:31,307
Let's drink together from one glass.

1654
01:53:31,471 --> 01:53:35,977
Half is mine.
Half is yours.

1655
01:53:36,309 --> 01:53:38,152
Drink, my Tabla.

1656
01:53:38,311 --> 01:53:39,085
Drink!

1657
01:53:43,716 --> 01:53:47,254
Why did you drink my half?
- You told me to drink half, sir!

1658
01:53:47,420 --> 01:53:51,800
I told you to have your half,
why did you have my half?

1659
01:53:51,991 --> 01:53:54,403
How can I drink bottom half
if upper half is there?

1660
01:53:54,561 --> 01:53:56,006
But half is still there, right?

1661
01:53:58,331 --> 01:54:02,677
You drank my half and
moreover advising me too.

1662
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:04,816
I want my half.

1663
01:54:05,071 --> 01:54:07,574
I want my half.

1664
01:54:08,842 --> 01:54:11,345
I want my half.

1665
01:54:11,477 --> 01:54:14,185
I want my half.
Gibe me, you skinhead!

1666
01:54:24,123 --> 01:54:26,000
I know you're the kidnapper.
Come to the point.

1667
01:54:26,159 --> 01:54:27,536
He has called madam.
- Let's hear their talk.

1668
01:54:27,694 --> 01:54:29,196
Where should I come with money?

1669
01:54:29,362 --> 01:54:30,534
Listen carefully.

1670
01:54:31,130 --> 01:54:33,736
50 kms away from city,
there's a flying club,

1671
01:54:33,933 --> 01:54:36,345
tomorrow at 10 am,
as we had decided,

1672
01:54:36,502 --> 01:54:38,482
you must come there
with Rs.75 crores.

1673
01:54:39,005 --> 01:54:41,042
<i>?.Rs.‘i5 crates?!</i>

1674
01:54:42,008 --> 01:54:43,544
You must come alone.

1675
01:54:43,710 --> 01:54:45,917
If you come with police
like group dancers,

1676
01:54:46,079 --> 01:54:48,252
you can watch your husband's
headless body in MMS.

1677
01:54:48,414 --> 01:54:49,518
How am Ito recognise you?

1678
01:54:49,682 --> 01:54:52,788
We'll come in black Fortuner car,
your husband will be in black mask.

1679
01:54:54,621 --> 01:54:56,066
Once we get the money,

1680
01:54:56,222 --> 01:54:57,292
we'll handover your husband to you,

1681
01:54:57,423 --> 01:54:59,699
then tell us, when should
we handover your money to you?

1682
01:54:59,859 --> 01:55:01,395
There mustn't be any change,
be careful.

1683
01:55:01,527 --> 01:55:02,528
Okay.

1684
01:55:06,232 --> 01:55:07,575
My guess has come true.

1685
01:55:07,901 --> 01:55:10,404
I've an opportunity to catch
the kidnappers red handed.

1686
01:55:10,570 --> 01:55:14,416
We must reach the place before
them and take the money.

1687
01:55:14,607 --> 01:55:15,278
Tell me, madam.

1688
01:55:15,441 --> 01:55:17,250
When I pay the ransom
to the kidnappers,

1689
01:55:17,577 --> 01:55:20,421
I'll tell you a plan
how to steal it from them.

1690
01:55:42,936 --> 01:55:44,540
Magic!

1691
01:55:59,652 --> 01:56:01,529
Hello, it's me!

1692
01:56:01,688 --> 01:56:04,760
You called me and say it's me!

1693
01:56:04,924 --> 01:56:06,995
I've stopped it long time ago.

1694
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:08,468
I'm Gopalakrishna.

1695
01:56:08,594 --> 01:56:10,471
Who the hell is he?

1696
01:56:11,531 --> 01:56:12,373
ls it you boss?

1697
01:56:12,532 --> 01:56:14,239
You said your brother is very clever.

1698
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:15,902
Do you know what my position is here?

1699
01:56:16,069 --> 01:56:18,811
He would've done something.
I must manage it.

1700
01:56:18,972 --> 01:56:21,782
Please forgive my brother
for one last time.

1701
01:56:21,941 --> 01:56:25,286
I'll ensure he won't do it again.
- Okay, there's not time.

1702
01:56:25,445 --> 01:56:28,824
I'll tell you what to do in short,
listen carefully,

1703
01:56:29,015 --> 01:56:31,586
tomorrow at 10 am in flying club,

1704
01:56:34,687 --> 01:56:36,132
my face would have black mask,

1705
01:56:36,255 --> 01:56:39,031
she's bringing Rs.75 crores
to free me,

1706
01:56:39,192 --> 01:56:41,365
at least this time plan it perfectly.

1707
01:56:49,235 --> 01:56:49,770
Sister!

1708
01:56:49,936 --> 01:56:53,406
What did you do
to make boss so angry?

1709
01:56:56,509 --> 01:56:58,853
He's showing psycho angle
in second session.

1710
01:56:59,012 --> 01:57:00,286
I gave him a fitting...

1711
01:57:00,446 --> 01:57:03,586
That's why he called me to
tell the plan instead of you.

1712
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:05,093
Plan? What plan?

1713
01:57:05,218 --> 01:57:07,596
Listen carefully and follow it.

1714
01:57:18,731 --> 01:57:23,703
We must arrest the kidnappers
red handed while accepting money.

1715
01:57:23,903 --> 01:57:24,881
You got it?

1716
01:57:25,138 --> 01:57:29,052
Your brother must steal the money
bag when I give it to kidnappers.

1717
01:57:41,921 --> 01:57:43,992
Did you bring money?
- Here it is!

1718
01:57:44,323 --> 01:57:45,301
It's in dollars.

1719
01:57:45,458 --> 01:57:46,300
Here's your husband.

1720
01:57:46,459 --> 01:57:50,168
Men had a deal with me, right?
Why did you women come?

1721
01:57:50,329 --> 01:57:52,036
Do you want your husband or our sex?

1722
01:57:52,231 --> 01:57:56,304
Black car, black mask and
car number are correct, right?

1723
01:57:56,469 --> 01:58:00,007
Send money and take your husband.
We don't have time.

1724
01:58:16,355 --> 01:58:17,493
Get down! Come!

1725
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:20,666
Do as I say!

1726
01:58:21,027 --> 01:58:21,732
Who are they?

1727
01:58:21,894 --> 01:58:23,703
Same car number and same mask.

1728
01:58:23,830 --> 01:58:25,400
Who are they?
- Here's your husband.

1729
01:58:25,565 --> 01:58:27,738
Pay ransom and take him.
No time to think.

1730
01:58:27,900 --> 01:58:29,777
How can my husband be
in two places?

1731
01:58:29,936 --> 01:58:32,280
Not two but three!

1732
01:58:40,813 --> 01:58:42,315
Have sweets, sir.

1733
01:58:42,482 --> 01:58:43,893
Sweet in this hot situation.

1734
01:58:44,050 --> 01:58:46,030
I came on earth on this day
40 years ago, sir.

1735
01:58:46,219 --> 01:58:47,357
So what?
- My birthday sir.

1736
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:50,592
To hell with...
- He respects very much sir.

1737
01:58:50,756 --> 01:58:53,566
These operations are routine.
Have it sir.

1738
01:58:53,693 --> 01:58:55,297
Give me.
- Have it.

1739
01:59:01,300 --> 01:59:04,645
Who are these guys?
- I know as much as you know.

1740
01:59:07,173 --> 01:59:08,777
Got late in traffic jam, sorry.

1741
01:59:08,941 --> 01:59:11,319
If you pay quickly, you can
take your husband to home.

1742
01:59:11,477 --> 01:59:14,219
Remove the mask, I'll pay.

1743
01:59:14,380 --> 01:59:16,883
Nephew, remove the mask and show.
- Okay.

1744
01:59:17,083 --> 01:59:17,754
Look at me!

1745
01:59:17,850 --> 01:59:20,626
Why did you remove your mask?
You must remove his mask, right?

1746
01:59:21,287 --> 01:59:23,528
What's this silly meeting?
I said your husband is with me.

1747
01:59:23,689 --> 01:59:24,633
Look at him!

1748
01:59:26,492 --> 01:59:27,664
Look at him clearly!

1749
01:59:29,095 --> 01:59:32,338
Why did you bring this buffoon
instead of boss?

1750
01:59:34,333 --> 01:59:35,607
He's your boss, right?

1751
01:59:35,768 --> 01:59:40,774
ls he my boss... you kidnapped...
- This man only.

1752
01:59:41,274 --> 01:59:42,548
You told me to kidnap Rama,
I did so.

1753
01:59:42,708 --> 01:59:44,119
Bend down, tall man!

1754
01:59:45,344 --> 01:59:47,346
I'm Krishna not Rama.

1755
01:59:48,014 --> 01:59:52,986
I wanted to settle down in Dubai with
boss' money, you ruined everything.

1756
01:59:53,653 --> 01:59:55,326
You've big body but no brain.

1757
01:59:55,454 --> 01:59:57,525
Sister! I did as you told me!

1758
01:59:57,690 --> 01:59:59,601
ls it you?

1759
02:00:00,092 --> 02:00:03,539
How long can I remain in mask?
I'm feeling breathlessness.

1760
02:00:03,696 --> 02:00:05,107
What's this?

1761
02:00:06,165 --> 02:00:08,372
Didn't we tell you
we've the original goods?

1762
02:00:11,404 --> 02:00:12,280
How dare you betray me!

1763
02:00:12,438 --> 02:00:13,815
Bloody dirty face!

1764
02:00:15,274 --> 02:00:19,347
This personality!
Designer Gajalakshmi!

1765
02:00:19,512 --> 02:00:21,617
You three?
- He recognised us.

1766
02:00:21,781 --> 02:00:23,886
We did this to get paid
for our hard work.

1767
02:00:24,016 --> 02:00:25,188
Don't we have a gun?

1768
02:00:25,351 --> 02:00:26,728
What are you looking at?

1769
02:00:26,886 --> 02:00:29,492
Would I say there are
no bullets in it? - Shut up!

1770
02:00:30,189 --> 02:00:32,191
Give the money to us.
- No, to us.

1771
02:00:32,391 --> 02:00:33,631
You'll get nothing.

1772
02:00:33,759 --> 02:00:35,739
He's our customer,
you know how much I spent on him?

1773
02:00:35,861 --> 02:00:37,465
We too spent a lot!

1774
02:00:37,630 --> 02:00:39,507
We spent more than you, big man!

1775
02:00:39,665 --> 02:00:41,144
Light the smoke bomb!

1776
02:00:46,339 --> 02:00:49,582
Who is smoking cigarette here?
- That's not a cigarette.

1777
02:01:04,924 --> 02:01:06,631
Did you do as I told you?
- I did sir.

1778
02:01:06,759 --> 02:01:07,703
Did the bomb go off?

1779
02:01:07,827 --> 02:01:09,932
It did but it wasn't our bomb, sir.

1780
02:01:10,096 --> 02:01:11,700
It's not important
hose bomb it is,

1781
02:01:11,864 --> 02:01:13,639
whether it went off or not
is the point.

1782
02:01:13,799 --> 02:01:14,436
Where's the money?

1783
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:16,637
I think it's in 22 Fortuner car, sir.

1784
02:01:16,802 --> 02:01:20,215
There are 3 cars with same number
and same colour.

1785
02:01:20,373 --> 02:01:22,114
Don't know which car
is carrying money, sir.

1786
02:01:22,275 --> 02:01:23,686
Where are the vehicle heading to?

1787
02:01:23,843 --> 02:01:25,789
Towards Pattaya highway, sir.

1788
02:01:27,046 --> 02:01:30,050
Are we safe?
- Triple safe, uncle.

1789
02:01:30,216 --> 02:01:33,789
We, our money and our heroine.

1790
02:01:33,953 --> 02:01:35,455
Oh, I mean my heroine.

1791
02:01:35,821 --> 02:01:38,631
Maha, your father's kidneys
too are safe.

1792
02:01:40,793 --> 02:01:42,397
Who are you?
Why are you holding my hand?

1793
02:01:42,561 --> 02:01:43,631
I didn't, you were holding my hand.

1794
02:01:43,796 --> 02:01:46,572
You pulled me from the smoke.

1795
02:01:46,899 --> 02:01:50,813
The money is ours.
If you don't give it to me...

1796
02:01:51,137 --> 02:01:52,980
Will you get operated for stammer?

1797
02:01:53,139 --> 02:01:55,483
Get lost! We struggled a lot for money.
- Uncle, control.

1798
02:01:55,641 --> 02:01:58,645
If you don't give, I'll kill you.

1799
02:01:58,811 --> 02:02:01,655
Uncle, it's his money,
let's return it.

1800
02:02:02,014 --> 02:02:03,687
Come to my way like that.

1801
02:02:03,849 --> 02:02:05,123
Way is that side.

1802
02:02:06,018 --> 02:02:08,294
What's there?
- Boot!

1803
02:02:08,487 --> 02:02:09,295
If so?

1804
02:02:09,555 --> 02:02:11,125
You must keep your money safe, right?

1805
02:02:11,290 --> 02:02:12,667
Open it.

1806
02:02:13,592 --> 02:02:14,935
Check if it's clean or not.

1807
02:02:18,764 --> 02:02:19,765
Where's Maha?

1808
02:02:19,932 --> 02:02:21,639
Who are you?
Why did you kidnap me?

1809
02:02:21,801 --> 02:02:24,782
I didn't kidnap, you got into
this car in confusion.

1810
02:02:24,937 --> 02:02:25,847
Stop the car.

1811
02:02:26,005 --> 02:02:28,781
If you want me to stop,
first stop the car following us.

1812
02:02:28,941 --> 02:02:30,113
I'll kill you, stop!

1813
02:02:30,276 --> 02:02:32,313
If I stop that skinhead will kill me.

1814
02:02:34,280 --> 02:02:35,281
Why don't you answer us?
Why did you get into this car?

1815
02:02:36,115 --> 02:02:37,185
You got into the car I got in.

1816
02:02:37,316 --> 02:02:39,193
Stop the car.
- I'll not.

1817
02:02:39,385 --> 02:02:41,160
If I stop how can catch the money
going in the car before us.

1818
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:42,321
ls money in that car?

1819
02:02:42,521 --> 02:02:46,628
Why would that car go so fast then?
- Then, go fast!

1820
02:02:47,526 --> 02:02:49,472
How dare you come with me!
You creep!

1821
02:02:49,628 --> 02:02:51,164
If I'm creep, then you're spooky!

1822
02:02:51,330 --> 02:02:54,209
That's my money.
- Shut up!

1823
02:02:54,367 --> 02:02:56,540
You betrayed staying close to me.

1824
02:02:56,702 --> 02:02:58,704
Didn't you cheat your wife
with a kidnap plan?

1825
02:02:58,871 --> 02:03:02,546
ls she a wife?
She tried to rob her husband.

1826
02:03:02,708 --> 02:03:05,211
ls it right if you do
and wrong if I do?

1827
02:03:28,667 --> 02:03:30,146
Watch out!

1828
02:04:18,918 --> 02:04:21,922
Where have you brought us?
- To Thota's empire.

1829
02:04:22,087 --> 02:04:23,794
Who is Thota?
- It's me!

1830
02:04:30,796 --> 02:04:32,275
Thotti!

1831
02:04:32,431 --> 02:04:34,502
How dare you call a Don as Thotti!

1832
02:04:34,667 --> 02:04:35,475
Don't you want to live?

1833
02:04:35,634 --> 02:04:39,980
He's Tata to you, for me he's
Thottempudi Tata Rao.

1834
02:04:40,139 --> 02:04:42,881
We were close friends in flashback.

1835
02:04:43,042 --> 02:04:45,522
They don't know our friendship...

1836
02:04:46,045 --> 02:04:48,252
In game nobody is close
not even brother-in-law.

1837
02:04:48,414 --> 02:04:49,722
Stand in line.

1838
02:04:49,882 --> 02:04:51,725
I'm your friend...

1839
02:04:52,151 --> 02:04:54,529
Tell me where's the money bag?
- We don't know.

1840
02:04:54,687 --> 02:04:58,157
If I get angry, I'm not a human.
Tell them.

1841
02:04:58,324 --> 02:05:01,771
If he gets angry,
he'll not be a human.

1842
02:05:01,927 --> 02:05:02,735
He'll become a beast.

1843
02:05:02,895 --> 02:05:04,340
He'll become a dirty rotten scoundrel!

1844
02:05:04,530 --> 02:05:05,531
He'll become a rogue!

1845
02:05:05,698 --> 02:05:06,768
He'll become a fool, you know that?

1846
02:05:06,932 --> 02:05:09,674
Enough! Tell me!
- We don't know.

1847
02:05:09,835 --> 02:05:13,214
Though you've money,
your lover isn't with you.

1848
02:05:13,372 --> 02:05:15,010
Where to search for her in Bangkok?

1849
02:05:15,174 --> 02:05:18,018
No need to search, we'll get the
information in few minutes.

1850
02:05:18,177 --> 02:05:19,554
How can you say so confidently?

1851
02:05:19,712 --> 02:05:21,191
I've so much trust on
her loose tongue.

1852
02:05:21,347 --> 02:05:23,623
You betrayer! Don't you've
any value for friendship?

1853
02:05:23,782 --> 02:05:27,696
I do, that's why I left you
though you're a big shot here.

1854
02:05:27,820 --> 02:05:31,324
We both don't have any right
to talk about friendship.

1855
02:05:31,490 --> 02:05:35,165
We both together cheated
Pedarayudu Ramamurthy.

1856
02:05:35,327 --> 02:05:37,898
That's why Ramamurthy's son
kidnapped me.

1857
02:05:38,063 --> 02:05:40,737
Did Ramamurthy's son dared
to kidnap in my area?

1858
02:05:40,900 --> 02:05:43,779
Today he kidnapped you,
he may kill me tomorrow.

1859
02:05:43,936 --> 02:05:45,916
I'm sure the money bag is with him.

1860
02:05:46,071 --> 02:05:49,917
Kill him and bring the money bag.

1861
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:54,384
Since you said no so loud,

1862
02:05:54,547 --> 02:05:56,493
I think you've a connection
with him.

1863
02:05:56,649 --> 02:05:58,287
Tell me, where is he?

1864
02:05:58,450 --> 02:06:02,421
Would I tell you he's my lover
and would do anything for me?

1865
02:06:02,621 --> 02:06:08,367
Would I tell you his number
is 0826535455?

1866
02:06:09,061 --> 02:06:09,903
I can hear it.

1867
02:06:10,663 --> 02:06:14,076
I'm kidnap king Thota here.
Your lover is with me.

1868
02:06:14,233 --> 02:06:15,041
I got it, uncle.

1869
02:06:15,200 --> 02:06:18,238
You want me to give the money
I've to free my love, right?

1870
02:06:18,404 --> 02:06:19,610
Tell me your address.

1871
02:06:19,772 --> 02:06:23,743
This is what you call lived like
a king and died like a pauper.

1872
02:06:24,243 --> 02:06:26,416
The mistakes we made brought us
to this situation.

1873
02:06:26,579 --> 02:06:29,890
If you've cunning girls as PA,
you're bound to go wrong only.

1874
02:06:30,049 --> 02:06:33,053
It's wrong to desire other women.

1875
02:06:33,218 --> 02:06:36,756
Yes, it is wrong,
there wasn't anyone to console me.

1876
02:06:36,922 --> 02:06:38,333
Did I refuse to console you?

1877
02:06:38,490 --> 02:06:40,800
Did you ever tell me that?

1878
02:06:40,960 --> 02:06:43,270
One can tell anything to
an understanding man.

1879
02:06:43,429 --> 02:06:45,340
You can tell in a way that
I can understand, right?

1880
02:06:45,497 --> 02:06:47,704
If there's a speck of doubt
between husband and wife,

1881
02:06:47,866 --> 02:06:49,436
people would make
mountains out of mole hills,

1882
02:06:49,602 --> 02:06:53,106
It was my mistake.
- I too made mistakes.

1883
02:06:58,978 --> 02:07:01,219
Owners are owners and PA's are PA's!

1884
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:04,554
Don't PA's have hands?
Let's shake hands!

1885
02:07:05,584 --> 02:07:08,360
Go...go...go...

1886
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:10,500
My hands are paining massaging you.

1887
02:07:10,689 --> 02:07:13,966
You tortured me more than Talibans,
I'll not spare you.

1888
02:07:14,093 --> 02:07:14,969
Won't you?

1889
02:07:15,127 --> 02:07:16,003
Then, I'll massage.

1890
02:07:16,161 --> 02:07:18,801
It's like camel's legs not human's.

1891
02:07:18,964 --> 02:07:20,534
Brother, leave him.

1892
02:07:20,833 --> 02:07:22,141
Leave him.
- Thank God!

1893
02:07:27,406 --> 02:07:30,478
Anyway you don't have a male companion,
for you three women...

1894
02:07:30,709 --> 02:07:33,815
I'll join your team.

1895
02:07:34,079 --> 02:07:36,616
Whichever team you may be
no use after losing money.

1896
02:07:40,052 --> 02:07:40,723
Nephew!

1897
02:07:41,587 --> 02:07:43,123
Do you know that man is?

1898
02:07:43,756 --> 02:07:44,461
Who?

1899
02:07:44,623 --> 02:07:46,569
Second villain of your life.
- Second villain?

1900
02:07:46,759 --> 02:07:53,176
He's Tata Rao, the other partner
who cheated your father.

1901
02:07:57,469 --> 02:07:59,676
I know you're Ramamurthy's son.

1902
02:07:59,838 --> 02:08:02,444
I know you're here to take
revenge on us.

1903
02:08:03,676 --> 02:08:05,849
He can't pronounce 'Ra'.

1904
02:08:10,949 --> 02:08:14,863
He's unable to carry the weight.
Take the money bag.

1905
02:08:15,120 --> 02:08:15,962
Give it.

1906
02:08:17,022 --> 02:08:18,262
You promised to leave her
after getting money, right?

1907
02:08:18,424 --> 02:08:23,032
I'll leave the girl and also
all others but on one condition.

1908
02:08:23,195 --> 02:08:23,730
What's that?

1909
02:08:23,896 --> 02:08:26,934
I'll do only 100 kidnaps
in any country,

1910
02:08:27,099 --> 02:08:30,444
I've completed 100 with
this kidnap!

1911
02:08:32,905 --> 02:08:38,184
Before I escape to Singapore,
I want to enjoy to the hilt!

1912
02:08:38,343 --> 02:08:43,224
If you entertain me with song
and dance, I'll free all of you.

1913
02:08:45,284 --> 02:08:52,896
Oh my beau! You pinched my heart
and left me for good...

1914
02:09:03,268 --> 02:09:06,408
Hey Babu! Rambabu!

1915
02:09:08,407 --> 02:09:15,757
Nawab with big moustache
and squeaking slippers...

1916
02:09:22,921 --> 02:09:30,567
A poor man breaking
into folk dances...

1917
02:10:22,681 --> 02:10:25,628
When I said you're a good man...

1918
02:10:25,784 --> 02:10:29,630
You sneaked under my cot...

1919
02:10:33,792 --> 02:10:36,932
When I invited you to my house...

1920
02:10:37,095 --> 02:10:41,441
You ripped apart my home...

1921
02:10:41,600 --> 02:10:48,518
No wife or nor she's pregnant but
son-in-law's name is Somalingam...

1922
02:10:48,674 --> 02:10:52,781
You ended up as good for
nothing in public...

1923
02:11:22,174 --> 02:11:25,212
To hell with you!
I've seen it!

1924
02:11:32,517 --> 02:11:35,862
If one can reach the top...

1925
02:11:36,054 --> 02:11:40,366
I'm a man who knocks him
down from there...

1926
02:11:43,996 --> 02:11:51,414
Why are you making noise?

1927
02:11:51,570 --> 02:11:55,074
You'll be sent on a leather hunt...

1928
02:11:55,240 --> 02:11:58,778
It seems a hungry horse stooped
down to eat dry grass...

1929
02:11:58,944 --> 02:12:02,858
If I burn you with hot iron,
bring down the sky with scream...

1930
02:12:19,364 --> 02:12:21,435
Song is over,
why don't you leave them, boss?

1931
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:25,707
They're our safety net
till we reach Singapore.

1932
02:12:25,871 --> 02:12:27,441
I'll tell after reaching Singapore.

1933
02:12:27,606 --> 02:12:29,847
If you like leave them
or else kill them.

1934
02:12:30,008 --> 02:12:31,715
Come, I'll tell.
- What will you tell?

1935
02:12:31,877 --> 02:12:37,020
I'll draw a plan in cottage 7 about
how to take money to Singapore.

1936
02:12:37,182 --> 02:12:39,423
Why walk till there?
Why not tell us here?

1937
02:12:39,584 --> 02:12:42,030
Trees have ears.

1938
02:12:43,088 --> 02:12:46,535
Not for trees but we do have ears.
I've another plan.

1939
02:12:54,232 --> 02:12:57,805
We've packed money in bags,
let's take Singapore highway!

1940
02:12:57,970 --> 02:12:59,449
What happened to your mind?
- What happened to your mind?

1941
02:12:59,604 --> 02:13:03,484
Police patrol the highway.

1942
02:13:04,209 --> 02:13:07,315
I'll draw up a plan!
See!

1943
02:13:07,980 --> 02:13:10,927
This is Pattaya boat club.
Tourist place.

1944
02:13:11,083 --> 02:13:12,562
No checking here.

1945
02:13:12,718 --> 02:13:16,666
We'll reach this spot in a van.

1946
02:13:17,622 --> 02:13:20,865
Transfer money bags from van
to speed boats.

1947
02:13:21,059 --> 02:13:24,404
Let's escape to Singapore via sea.

1948
02:13:24,563 --> 02:13:26,509
Give me a lighter.

1949
02:13:26,765 --> 02:13:27,766
What are you doing, boss?

1950
02:13:27,899 --> 02:13:31,608
I'm burning to keep my plan a secret.

1951
02:13:32,804 --> 02:13:34,511
Come on, boys.

1952
02:13:35,273 --> 02:13:40,018
Why draw and burn this lousy plan?
My damn fate!

1953
02:13:49,588 --> 02:13:52,296
Nephew, your carbon plan
has worked out.

1954
02:13:54,359 --> 02:13:57,829
Shifting money to Singapore by boat.
Let's go.

1955
02:14:05,804 --> 02:14:09,149
This is Pattaya boat club.
Tourist place.

1956
02:14:09,307 --> 02:14:14,723
No checking here.
We'll reach this spot in a van.

1957
02:14:21,453 --> 02:14:24,229
I must divert them.
Wait!

1958
02:14:24,456 --> 02:14:26,129
I kept it somewhere here only.

1959
02:14:26,458 --> 02:14:28,233
Where did I keep it?

1960
02:14:29,127 --> 02:14:30,435
Where did it fell?

1961
02:14:39,604 --> 02:14:40,912
Where did I keep it?

1962
02:14:41,506 --> 02:14:43,076
What did you do?
- Watch the show now!

1963
02:14:44,342 --> 02:14:46,117
You must put a card
and then pick one.

1964
02:14:46,278 --> 02:14:47,848
I did throw a card
before picking it.

1965
02:14:48,013 --> 02:14:49,686
You're getting too comical off late.

1966
02:14:49,848 --> 02:14:51,259
I don't accept this in card game.

1967
02:14:51,416 --> 02:14:53,521
What can I do if you go blind?

1968
02:14:53,685 --> 02:14:56,393
I lost only eyes, find with
whom your wife is eloping!

1969
02:14:56,555 --> 02:14:58,501
I'll tolerate if you abuse him
but not his wife.

1970
02:14:58,623 --> 02:15:00,762
What bothers you if he
abuses my wife?

1971
02:15:00,926 --> 02:15:02,371
Don't know what affair
he's having with her?

1972
02:15:02,527 --> 02:15:05,269
How dare you accuse my wife
of having an affair?

1973
02:15:16,675 --> 02:15:18,279
This is the right time.

1974
02:15:28,086 --> 02:15:29,292
Come fast!

1975
02:15:32,457 --> 02:15:34,300
Keep it quickly in boat.

1976
02:15:35,494 --> 02:15:36,199
Quick!

1977
02:15:42,534 --> 02:15:43,740
My boat is leaving!

1978
02:15:46,104 --> 02:15:46,912
Where did he come from?

1979
02:15:47,072 --> 02:15:49,985
You've been cheated!

1980
02:15:55,547 --> 02:15:57,151
Pull the boat.

1981
02:15:57,482 --> 02:15:59,120
Pull it with power.

1982
02:16:11,663 --> 02:16:13,142
Check if it has money or not!

1983
02:16:13,331 --> 02:16:14,002
Check it.

1984
02:16:21,606 --> 02:16:24,348
We can buy as many kidney
as your father wants.

1985
02:16:25,477 --> 02:16:26,387
Line is clear for our marriage.

1986
02:16:26,545 --> 02:16:27,683
Nephew, police!

1987
02:16:31,116 --> 02:16:32,254
What shall we do now?

1988
02:16:32,417 --> 02:16:33,487
We'll get caught if we stop.

1989
02:16:33,652 --> 02:16:35,359
If we don't stop, we'll get booked.

1990
02:16:35,520 --> 02:16:36,157
What to do?

1991
02:16:37,155 --> 02:16:39,658
Why is he circling us?

1992
02:16:45,864 --> 02:16:48,367
They must come to our boat
and check it,

1993
02:16:48,533 --> 02:16:49,944
why are they calling us
to their boat?

1994
02:16:50,101 --> 02:16:52,707
That's better.
Let's tell them we don't have money.

1995
02:16:52,871 --> 02:16:55,044
I beg you, dear.
Please don't open your mouth.

1996
02:16:55,207 --> 02:16:56,709
Come, I'll tell you.

1997
02:17:04,216 --> 02:17:04,887
Chocolate?

1998
02:17:07,185 --> 02:17:09,631
Why is he giving chocolates?
- May be his birthday.

1999
02:17:09,821 --> 02:17:13,394
Silly girl! Would anyone give
chocolate pointing a gun?

2000
02:17:15,961 --> 02:17:16,598
Give it to me.

2001
02:17:19,130 --> 02:17:22,805
Have chocolates with fake police.
We're in for great luck!

2002
02:17:22,968 --> 02:17:25,244
They diverted us and
taking away our money.

2003
02:17:25,403 --> 02:17:26,347
Uncle, let's go.

2004
02:17:26,504 --> 02:17:31,510
Police are corrupt here also.
They robbed us with chocolates.

2005
02:17:33,845 --> 02:17:35,847
GO-“go!

2006
02:18:11,283 --> 02:18:13,263
StOp-"Stop-H

2007
02:18:13,885 --> 02:18:15,592
You're finished today!

2008
02:18:19,524 --> 02:18:21,470
They're running away with money.

2009
02:18:41,813 --> 02:18:43,383
Looks like everything is upside down!

2010
02:18:43,548 --> 02:18:45,619
Where did they go?
- That side.

2011
02:18:50,155 --> 02:18:51,896
Come fast!
Stop!

2012
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:57,966
Nephew, look there!
- Forget about that we must get the money.

2013
02:18:59,064 --> 02:19:00,941
If we stay together,
we may get caught.

2014
02:19:01,099 --> 02:19:03,978
Let's meet in boat, you both go
that side, you go this side.

2015
02:19:04,135 --> 02:19:05,079
I'll go straight.

2016
02:19:07,605 --> 02:19:08,276
That side!

2017
02:19:09,574 --> 02:19:10,518
Look there!

2018
02:19:12,844 --> 02:19:14,687
You go here, you go here.

2019
02:19:15,347 --> 02:19:16,849
Wet floor, be careful.

2020
02:19:18,783 --> 02:19:19,659
Got you, man!

2021
02:19:23,154 --> 02:19:23,825
YOu!

2022
02:19:31,463 --> 02:19:33,033
There's a rod behind me, skinhead!

2023
02:19:36,901 --> 02:19:38,346
Where are you going?

2024
02:19:40,572 --> 02:19:44,042
Don't confuse me rounding up?
- We rounded to confuse you.

2025
02:19:50,248 --> 02:19:50,919
Pick it.

2026
02:19:52,450 --> 02:19:53,360
Done!

2027
02:19:58,356 --> 02:19:59,562
My bag!

2028
02:20:00,225 --> 02:20:01,203
You come.

2029
02:20:07,632 --> 02:20:10,670
If you move, I'll fire.
Be careful!

2030
02:20:15,740 --> 02:20:17,344
Give the bag to me.

2031
02:20:17,509 --> 02:20:21,514
If not two bullets will
come out from two barrels.

2032
02:20:21,679 --> 02:20:22,919
Two barrels!

2033
02:20:24,482 --> 02:20:25,722
How can it come out now?

2034
02:20:25,884 --> 02:20:26,726
Come on!

2035
02:20:30,221 --> 02:20:31,598
Boss, cut it.

2036
02:20:34,025 --> 02:20:36,005
Water! Stop. . . stop...

2037
02:20:59,350 --> 02:21:00,351
Where's the bag?

2038
02:21:00,552 --> 02:21:02,031
They're running away.

2039
02:21:02,253 --> 02:21:03,755
Come...come... Come...

2040
02:21:07,392 --> 02:21:09,167
That's my bag!

2041
02:21:10,628 --> 02:21:11,971
My bag!

2042
02:21:12,263 --> 02:21:13,799
Mine...my bag!

2043
02:21:19,337 --> 02:21:22,284
Don't you dare with me,
bullets will come out now.

2044
02:21:22,440 --> 02:21:24,010
Take the bags, boys.

2045
02:21:24,175 --> 02:21:26,985
My bag...my bag!

2046
02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:32,284
Boss, they're foolish than you.

2047
02:21:32,450 --> 02:21:34,987
Don't they know guns on walls
aren't loaded?

2048
02:21:35,153 --> 02:21:37,963
Not loaded? Catch them!

2049
02:21:50,435 --> 02:21:51,675
What are they looking at?

2050
02:22:04,716 --> 02:22:08,562
We were meeting here secretly
to catch a criminal,

2051
02:22:08,720 --> 02:22:10,324
the criminal has walked in himself.

2052
02:22:12,991 --> 02:22:14,800
Reward is 50000 dollars!

2053
02:22:15,793 --> 02:22:18,034
Stop....stop...
where are you going away?

2054
02:22:19,163 --> 02:22:20,699
Where will you run away man?

2055
02:22:20,865 --> 02:22:24,642
I dared and risked life to catch you
with money and handover to police.

2056
02:22:24,802 --> 02:22:26,475
Where will you run away?

2057
02:22:28,373 --> 02:22:29,818
Why are you falling beating him?

2058
02:22:38,216 --> 02:22:41,163
Allow me to go free
if not I'll kill him.

2059
02:22:41,319 --> 02:22:42,798
Allow me to go free.

2060
02:22:43,154 --> 02:22:46,795
No use to hide behind an old man.

2061
02:22:46,958 --> 02:22:48,904
If you've guts like NTR,

2062
02:22:49,294 --> 02:22:50,830
if you're proud like Raviteja,

2063
02:22:51,296 --> 02:22:53,071
if you can create havoc like Ramcharan,

2064
02:22:53,798 --> 02:22:55,903
fire at me!

2065
02:22:58,570 --> 02:23:00,743
Fire me here!
If not here!

2066
02:23:00,905 --> 02:23:03,579
Fire!

2067
02:23:05,410 --> 02:23:06,912
How did my gun reach your hands?

2068
02:23:07,845 --> 02:23:10,189
You've to believe few truths
on seeing it.

2069
02:23:14,719 --> 02:23:16,756
Catch the crooks.

2070
02:23:17,155 --> 02:23:18,156
Take them away!

2071
02:23:23,328 --> 02:23:24,932
I appreciate your bravery.

2072
02:23:25,096 --> 02:23:29,101
I'll see that you get the reward
from Thai government.

2073
02:23:29,667 --> 02:23:30,771
Your gun.

2074
02:23:31,235 --> 02:23:33,772
By the way who kidnapped you, Gopalakrishna?

2075
02:23:37,308 --> 02:23:40,346
Who else? That Tata Rao!

2076
02:23:42,547 --> 02:23:43,890
Who are these people?

2077
02:23:44,115 --> 02:23:46,152
They're my people.

2078
02:23:46,317 --> 02:23:49,787
Then, come to station to file
a detailed statement.

2079
02:23:53,124 --> 02:23:57,595
I don't know how am I
to thank you, son!

2080
02:23:57,795 --> 02:24:01,402
Without bothering about revenge,
you saved my life.

2081
02:24:01,532 --> 02:24:04,138
I'll correct the mistake
I made years ago.

2082
02:24:05,837 --> 02:24:09,478
In fact I must say sorry to you.

2083
02:24:09,641 --> 02:24:12,645
Whatever it is, kidnapping is crime.

2084
02:24:13,678 --> 02:24:15,214
I must say sorry.

2085
02:24:15,380 --> 02:24:18,486
I planned to get my husband kidnapped.

2086
02:24:19,784 --> 02:24:21,491
It was all my mistake.

2087
02:24:21,853 --> 02:24:23,628
We must say sorry to you, sir.

2088
02:24:23,821 --> 02:24:26,825
We betrayed you after eating
your pizzas and burgers.

2089
02:24:29,560 --> 02:24:32,837
It was my mistake for not
encouraging your talent.

2090
02:24:33,164 --> 02:24:35,166
We're saying sorry, sir.

2091
02:24:35,333 --> 02:24:38,712
I don't know why everyone is
saying sorry, I'm also sorry.

2092
02:24:39,671 --> 02:24:43,414
If we don't say sorry now,
people would think we're the villains.

2093
02:24:43,574 --> 02:24:44,678
Let's say it.

2094
02:24:48,479 --> 02:24:50,186
I tried to use your weakness.

2095
02:24:52,050 --> 02:24:55,588
I had weakness that you used it.
It wasn't your mistake.

2096
02:25:01,492 --> 02:25:02,197
Stop it!

2097
02:25:03,361 --> 02:25:05,967
Sorry for stopping your sorry marathon.

2098
02:25:06,130 --> 02:25:08,508
Did you realise the reason
for all this trouble?

2099
02:25:08,800 --> 02:25:09,710
Money disease.

2100
02:25:09,967 --> 02:25:12,470
Goat must shake the tail,
tail mustn't shake the goat.

2101
02:25:12,637 --> 02:25:15,140
Man must play with money,
money mustn't defeat man,

2102
02:25:15,306 --> 02:25:16,808
how is my dialogue, Maha?

2103
02:25:16,974 --> 02:25:22,583
Would I say punch lines are shattering
though understood or not?

2104
02:25:22,747 --> 02:25:25,853
Impossible to get
information from me.

2105
02:25:29,220 --> 02:25:33,134
Settling Seth's loan with
Thai govt. reward,

2106
02:25:33,257 --> 02:25:36,534
Buchi Raju saved Subba Rao's
kidneys and eyes.

2107
02:25:37,695 --> 02:25:44,408
Gopalakrishna returned money to Buchi
and living happily with his wife.

2108
02:25:44,969 --> 02:25:51,750
Appalaraju realised only hard work
can make him rich not good luck.

2109
02:25:56,314 --> 02:26:02,321
Subba Rao's daily duty is to show
his riches before Jagadamba.

2110
02:26:03,354 --> 02:26:09,270
Our hero Buchi Raju bought the shopping
mall where he worked as salesman.

2111
02:26:09,494 --> 02:26:12,441
By the way everything was rocking!
