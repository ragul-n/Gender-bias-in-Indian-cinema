I mean with my turban.
Like this.

186
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:41,648
How dare you!
- I got sIapped once.

187
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:45,221
Liar. Your pen can't work
but your hand works to sIap!

188
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,191
You hand hurts. right?
- It does.

189
00:10:47,327 --> 00:10:48,419
But it doesn't when I sIap.

190
00:10:48,494 --> 00:10:49,461
Idiot

191
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:51,357
He sIapped me.

192
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:52,563
Idiot.

193
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:55,231
Where you going?

194
00:10:55,435 --> 00:10:57,528
First you made me burn
petroI of Rs. 50...

195
00:10:57,603 --> 00:10:59,366
...by making me give a Iift

196
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:02,772
Now I have paid Rs. 250 advance
to get the form fiIIed.

197
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:05,537
Whom did you give it to?

198
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:07,210
Shut up.

199
00:11:08,848 --> 00:11:11,112
She is a cityite and he is a Jat.

200
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:14,181
It's okay. Shampy.
Don't feeI insuIted..

201
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:16,346

202
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:18,149
Excuse me. sister.

203
00:11:25,631 --> 00:11:26,757
What is this?

204
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:28,361
It must be my photograph.

205
00:11:28,568 --> 00:11:29,535
He must be thinking...

206
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:32,263
...okay. if not the mother herseIf.
in Canada Iet mother's photo be.

207
00:11:34,841 --> 00:11:35,899
What's this?

208
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:37,771
Oh. my God.

209
00:11:38,444 --> 00:11:39,877
Hey. Iook at this.

210
00:11:40,747 --> 00:11:43,215
Isn't she the Bachchan's
daughter from Chandigarh?

211
00:11:43,816 --> 00:11:45,943
WiId hair and scantiIy-cIad girI.

212
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,510
No. dear.
She is our MaIIika Sherawat.

213
00:11:49,322 --> 00:11:51,222
Our MaIIika?
Who is she?

214
00:11:51,657 --> 00:11:53,181
The one who comes in movies.

215
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,821
How do you know that?

216
00:11:56,796 --> 00:11:58,525
I Just came to know through
going around in neighbourhood.

217
00:11:58,598 --> 00:11:59,963
We are surrounded by tempIes...

218
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,428
...and are schooIs around.

219
00:12:02,368 --> 00:12:04,165
Where do they teach this Iesson?

220
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:06,570
OnIy God can save anyone from you.

221
00:12:07,607 --> 00:12:08,699
This is a Iimit.

222
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:10,469
You never know with this girI.

223
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:12,204
What kind of cIothes
has she packed?

224
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:14,870
Mom. what are you doing?

225
00:12:15,114 --> 00:12:16,741
Why are you taking out
my Jeans and skirts?

226
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:18,782
Papa. Iook at this.

227
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:21,452
WiII you go out and
wear such cIothes?

228
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:23,712
Everyone wears Jeans abroad.

229
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:25,613
Do you expect her to wear
a 'burka' (veiI)?

230
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:27,291
Good one.

231
00:12:27,627 --> 00:12:29,424
Why are you Iaughing?

232
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:31,822
You shouId wear nice suit
and cover your head with scarf.

233
00:12:31,898 --> 00:12:33,160
You are no Ionger a kid.

234
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:34,594
Here you go. Is this fine?

235
00:12:35,435 --> 00:12:38,233
I don't feeI Iike sending
her abroad.

236
00:12:38,304 --> 00:12:39,464
HardIy ten months are Ieft
for her wedding.

237
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:40,471
Why don't we get her
married sooner?

238
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,474
Momma. the one
I am getting married to...

239
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:44,339
...he has no probIems and
you've made an issue of it?

240
00:12:45,244 --> 00:12:46,768
It's Just a question of
7 to 8 months

241
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,149
It is a very big thing to do a
dipIoma from such a good institute.

242
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:52,546
Tomorrow your daughter wiII
be a famous fashion designer.

243
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:54,141
Or eIse...

244
00:12:55,188 --> 00:12:57,452
...she wiII sit idIe and
troubIe her husband.

245
00:12:57,924 --> 00:12:59,482
Do I troubIe you?

246
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:01,454
No. Who says so?

247
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:03,094
PooJa. did I say so?
- No.

248
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,527
You are Iaughing again.

249
00:13:05,598 --> 00:13:06,860
Get this straight.

250
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:10,329
If you go there and say
Mummy. the food here isn't good.

251
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,664
My room is not good.

252
00:13:11,804 --> 00:13:13,169
I wiII caII you back right away.

253
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:15,730
Come what may. I wiII return
onIy after I finish my course.

254
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:17,776
First of aII there won't be
any probIem.

255
00:13:17,844 --> 00:13:19,277
Canada is a cuItured country.

256
00:13:19,345 --> 00:13:20,835
And onIy cuItured peopIe go there.

257
00:13:20,913 --> 00:13:23,381
First deed is to toiI hard

258
00:13:23,516 --> 00:13:25,882
The other is to down
the bottIes

259
00:13:26,385 --> 00:13:30,879
Third deed of ours if
anyone dare us to fight

260
00:13:31,124 --> 00:13:32,751
We aIways are fearIess

261
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,358
Move.

262
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:36,617
It's moving?

263
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:38,789
Why don't you push hard?
- I am pushing.

264
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:41,865
Bike is moving?
- What are you doing?

265
00:13:42,768 --> 00:13:43,792
It's moving?

266
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,465
It moving. ShouId I turn it
in to a HeIicopter?

267
00:13:46,572 --> 00:13:48,938
Hey. at Ieast Iook...
- Even the cycIe guy overtook.

268
00:13:49,308 --> 00:13:51,333
Move my queen.
god is your saviour.

269
00:13:53,446 --> 00:13:55,846
WiII you turn to right?
Watch out. Watch!

270
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,644
Come now. it's enough.

271
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:07,621
Okay.
- Live Iong. Go on.

272
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,628
Take care. brother.
Don't forget me. - I won't

273
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:13,322
Here you go. Be happy.

274
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,264
May God makes you meet
a beautifuI girI. - Yes.

275
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:16,892
Listen to me for a minute.
- Yes?

276
00:14:17,203 --> 00:14:20,400
Here I have brought with
me the speciaI fritter's Manu.

277
00:14:20,473 --> 00:14:21,804
Not the Manu. the recipe.

278
00:14:22,308 --> 00:14:24,173
HoId it. - It is that speciaI
fritter's recipe? - Yes.

279
00:14:24,243 --> 00:14:26,643
And this is aunt Bachchan's
recipe for making green veggies.

280
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:28,508
Okay.
- A Iot of Indians stay there.

281
00:14:28,648 --> 00:14:29,672
And they eat a Iot of greens.

282
00:14:29,815 --> 00:14:30,839
And here is...

283
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,547
...Chandu the confectioner's
recipe of 'JeIebis' (Indian sweet)

284
00:14:32,618 --> 00:14:34,108
Enough. I think that's more
than enough for me.

285
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:35,552
Okay. Listen up.
- What?

286
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:36,883
When you go inside...
-Yeah.

287
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:38,647
...Keep your eyes open.
- Okay.

288
00:14:38,758 --> 00:14:40,157

...you might find a girI at
the airport itseIf. - ReaIIy?

290
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,162
Fine.

291
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:48,131
Daddy.

292
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:49,832
Don't worry.

293
00:14:50,136 --> 00:14:52,900

294
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:55,764

295
00:14:56,142 --> 00:14:57,609

00:16:42,581 --> 00:16:44,242
...and my son can have the tea.

340
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:45,816
Son?

341
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:46,782
Yes. son.

342
00:16:46,852 --> 00:16:48,376
You are married?
- Of course.

343
00:16:49,488 --> 00:16:51,649
Then you shouId have tea.
It is good heaIth.

344
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,616
Tea and Shampy have nothing
to do with married peopIe.

345
00:16:55,928 --> 00:16:56,860
Sister.

346
00:16:59,298 --> 00:17:00,356
They are strange guys!

347
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:02,628
Sorry. sir.
We cannot take this tea back.

348
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:04,327
How can't you take it back?

349
00:17:04,403 --> 00:17:08,066
This tea is as fresh and
untouched as me.

350
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,142
QuietIy pIace Rs. 80
on my hand Iike this.

351
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:13,539
Otherwise nobody wiII be
your worst enemy.

352
00:17:13,612 --> 00:17:15,136
I wiII caII the security.
I wiII shout.

353
00:17:15,214 --> 00:17:17,614
Sue you.
I am very short-tempered.

354
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,809
You see. the thing is.
I bought the tea for a girI.

355
00:17:19,885 --> 00:17:21,750
She turned out to be married.
It became useIess.

356
00:17:22,154 --> 00:17:23,587
I'II see how you go to Canada.

357
00:17:23,856 --> 00:17:25,323
It's of no use
to me.

358
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:27,585
QuietIy pay up or
the fight wiII escaIate.

359
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,355
We wiII have a terribIe fight.

360
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:31,794
Okay. Fateh Singh. Now find
another permanent resident.

361
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:33,790
Dood Morning.
- Good morning.

362
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,724
Your passport and boarding card?

363
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:36,859
Yeah. Passport.

364
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:38,665
The passport...

365
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,200
I had kept my passport here.
Where's it gone?

366
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:46,502
Where's the passport...

367
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:49,139
Sir. pIease move back.
PIease stand aside.

368
00:17:49,215 --> 00:17:50,273
Why on the side?

369
00:17:50,816 --> 00:17:53,614
I swear on my bike.
I had a passport.

370
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:56,117
You cannot go enter
without a passport.

371
00:17:56,222 --> 00:17:57,382
How can't I go inside?

372
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,549
No one can stop Shampy
from going to Canada.

373
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,092
I want to buy a bigger bike.

374
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,651
If you stop me I wiII hurt you
with my turban.

375
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:05,458
Move. Move back.

376
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,827
Two sIaps to dear son!

377
00:18:09,402 --> 00:18:11,165
Now I get three sIaps.

378
00:18:13,406 --> 00:18:15,306
Excuse me!
Can you pIease carry our bags?

379
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:18,667
I couId have done so by myseIf
but my hand is inJured.

380
00:18:19,078 --> 00:18:21,171
ActuaIIy. yesterday when
I was feeding the cattIe...

381
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:24,411
And the robe came Ioose.
Etcetera. Etcetera

382
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:27,145
Now no matter what you say.
we need to stick together.

383
00:18:27,286 --> 00:18:29,254
Because both of us are going
to Canada.

384
00:18:29,355 --> 00:18:32,324
It is a 20 hour Journey. It'II
be easier if we stay together.

385
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:34,355
By the way. pay attention when
they make the enouncecant.

386
00:18:34,427 --> 00:18:36,361
It's not Enouncecant.
it is Announcement.

387
00:18:36,662 --> 00:18:38,129
Whatever.
You'II pay attention. won't you?

388
00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:38,788
Go away!

389
00:18:38,864 --> 00:18:40,092
Where are you going?

390
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:42,429
Forget 20 hours. I cannot sit
with you even for 20 seconds.

391
00:18:43,102 --> 00:18:43,898
Smartass.

392
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:49,173
Now teII me. you never know
what's in store in Iife.

393
00:18:49,575 --> 00:18:50,564
That's why I say...

394
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:52,907
...that without thinking one
shouIdn't give any straight-pant.

395
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,906
It's not Straight-pant.
it is Statement.

396
00:18:55,247 --> 00:18:56,805
Whatever it may be.
You shouIdn't give it.

397
00:18:57,183 --> 00:18:59,583
If I sit with him.
he wiII make me crazy.

398
00:19:00,386 --> 00:19:01,478
What? Crazy?

399
00:19:01,687 --> 00:19:02,551
Yes. Ma'am?

400
00:19:02,621 --> 00:19:03,713
Can you change my seat. pIease?

401
00:19:04,123 --> 00:19:05,613
Sorry. Ma'am.
aII seats are occupied.

402
00:19:05,691 --> 00:19:07,852
Oh. God. I accept whatever
You have in stored for me.

403
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:09,754
Oh. God. Oh. God. Oh. God.

404
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:14,524
Look... I was chatting so that...

405
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,398
I was chatting so that
this Iong Journey gets easy.

406
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,595
If you don't want to taIk
or hear me. then don't.

407
00:19:20,072 --> 00:19:21,334
I. too. am going to remove
my turban and sIeep.

408
00:19:21,407 --> 00:19:22,635
It's a very Iong Journey.
Right?

409
00:19:25,811 --> 00:19:28,371
Daddy!

410
00:19:29,582 --> 00:19:32,107
Give me a kiss darIing.
- Oh. sure. baby.

411
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:34,517
Hey!

412
00:19:35,287 --> 00:19:36,219
Back off.

413
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:38,147
How did I come here?

414
00:19:38,324 --> 00:19:39,552
Wasn't I giving a hug
to the Canadian woman?

415
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:40,649
I know everything.

416
00:19:40,726 --> 00:19:42,193
It is Just an excuse to
take advantage of.

417
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:43,626
You are sticking on Iike a Ieech.

418
00:19:44,163 --> 00:19:47,189
A Ieech? If I want to do that
I wouId to a Canadian resident.

419
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,766
I won't Ieech on to
someone hideous Iike you.

420
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:51,200
What? Hideous?
- Yes. Hideous.

421
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,094
Have you ever seen
your face in the mirror?

422
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:54,662
You Iook Iike Gurdas
Mann's chorus singer.

423
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:56,502
Are you a girI or a witch?

424
00:19:56,842 --> 00:19:58,241
Had this safety beIt was not on..

425
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,277
..I wouId have taught you a Iesson.

426
00:19:59,345 --> 00:20:01,176
Oh. reaIIy?
Then uncIasp it and go ahead.

427
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:03,841
That's the probIem.
I don't know how to open it.

428
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,244
Passengers are requested
to fasten their seatbeIts.

429
00:20:07,453 --> 00:20:10,786
. As our fIight is about to Iand
at Vancouver Int. Airport.'

430
00:20:10,856 --> 00:20:12,380
She speaks so weII.

431
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,323
We'II be Ianding shortIy in Canada!
- Canada!

432
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,863

433
00:20:20,165 --> 00:20:21,598
We are Ianding in Canada?
- Yes. sir.

434
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:23,897
Then heIp me tie my turban.

435
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,202
Nothing.

436
00:20:58,437 --> 00:20:59,404
See you then.

437
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:01,330
Didn't even reaIize when
the Journey ended.

438
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:02,601
Hours fIew Iike minutes.

439
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:04,503
This is the Iongest
Journey of my Iife.

440
00:21:04,743 --> 00:21:05,607
Great.

441
00:21:05,678 --> 00:21:07,270
Forgot PunJabi as soon as
you Ianded in Canada.

442
00:21:07,413 --> 00:21:08,402
And you've started
speaking EngIish?

443
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,345
That's enough now. I am..
- Show me what it is?

444
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,883
From where do I..
- What are you doing?

445
00:21:13,786 --> 00:21:14,650
This is my photo.

446
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,484
If you find a resident PunJabi
or even a Canadian girI..

447
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,851
..then show her my photo. give
her a rupee and fix my aIIiance.

448
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,592
Don't waste time.
because after aII..

449
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,287
..in a foreign country a PunJabi
shouId come handy to another.

450
00:21:23,362 --> 00:21:24,693
Of course.
You are right.

451
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,325
Hence whenever I see
a resident PunJabi girI..

452
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,397
..I wiII show her your photo
and warn her..

453
00:21:29,468 --> 00:21:31,129
..and teII her not to get invoIved
with a beast Iike you.

454
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,259
Idiot.
- Monkey.

455
00:21:45,651 --> 00:21:47,448
Oh. God.
is she a girI or troubIe?

456
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,751
Thank God.
I won't have to face her again.

457
00:21:54,193 --> 00:21:55,524
God. what did you get me into?

458
00:21:55,594 --> 00:21:57,152
Thank God I got rid of him.

459
00:21:57,429 --> 00:22:00,159
Jat has reached Canada. my dear.

460
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,568
It is very coId out here.

461
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,568
HeIIo.

462
00:22:05,838 --> 00:22:07,669
HeIIo. Yes. Fateh.

463
00:22:07,806 --> 00:22:10,434
So did you get settIed there?
- SettIed?

464
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:13,305
This pIace and its peopIe are
so good. Such beautifuI.. Oh God.

465
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:15,108
Hey. watch were you are going.
you idiot.

466
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,442
Same to you.

467
00:22:17,282 --> 00:22:18,442
They are so friendIy.

468
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:20,313
Who is taIking in EngIish
in the background?

469
00:22:20,386 --> 00:22:22,752
No one. I wanted a servant
to do odd Jobs at home.

470
00:22:22,855 --> 00:22:23,787
What?

471
00:22:24,523 --> 00:22:25,785
Have you kept a Canadian servant?

472
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:26,916
What's so great about it?

473
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:29,457
Okay. fine now. Stop taIking.
I am in Canada. you idiot.

474
00:22:30,562 --> 00:22:32,587
I wonder how much he
has got me biIIed in doIIars.

475
00:22:33,832 --> 00:22:34,856
Strange. man!

476
00:22:35,234 --> 00:22:36,428
There are such servants
in Canadian as weII?

477
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:39,194
Why did he keep a
Canadian as his servant..

478
00:22:39,271 --> 00:22:41,432
..and why not someone
from one of his natives?

479
00:22:41,573 --> 00:22:43,507
Hey. I hear..

480
00:22:43,575 --> 00:22:46,271
..even rustic natives there
speak EngIish.

481
00:22:46,545 --> 00:22:48,274
And comes in a cars..

482
00:22:48,447 --> 00:22:50,938
..to pIough the ground and
do meniaI Jobs.

483
00:22:51,183 --> 00:22:53,617
Brother.
why won't he come in a car?

484
00:22:53,752 --> 00:22:55,720
There are thousands of Biharis.

485
00:22:55,888 --> 00:22:59,415
Post graduate in Arts.
He even has a mobiIe phone.

486
00:22:59,858 --> 00:23:01,519
I have even heard that..

487
00:23:01,694 --> 00:23:05,289
..the rustic guy there. eat more
than the guys here.

488
00:23:09,435 --> 00:23:10,561
Apna ChuIha (Our Stove).

489
00:23:10,903 --> 00:23:12,234
Apna ChuIha.

490
00:23:13,172 --> 00:23:15,640
The address is the same.
But they've put up two boards.

491
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:19,634
A customer!

492
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:21,671
Let's find out.

493
00:23:21,847 --> 00:23:23,906
Before the witch
comes and nabs him..

494
00:23:24,216 --> 00:23:25,581
..I shouId grab him outside.

495
00:23:27,186 --> 00:23:28,118

PeopIe who wear such turbans
usuaIIy come from PunJab.

504
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:44,168
They can't be coming
from China. - What?

505
00:23:44,236 --> 00:23:45,294
Sit. Have a seat.

506

00:23:50,743 --> 00:23:51,801

What is money?

512
00:23:55,514 --> 00:23:57,141
Money is Just the dirt of hand.

513
00:23:57,349 --> 00:23:59,180
And by the grace of God
I have a Iot.

514
00:23:59,251 --> 00:24:01,583
What? - I mean it
snows a Iot in Canada.

00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,381
So. we bathe Iess during Christmas.

Look. it doesn't snow at aII

Kidney beans. meat baIIs in cream.

Bro. I am starving.

521
00:24:13,866 --> 00:24:16,096
Having sandwiches in pIane has
constipated me.

522
00:24:16,168 --> 00:24:17,260
And they don't even speak properIy.

523
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:18,461
She asked me what wiII I eat.

524
00:24:18,537 --> 00:24:19,731
I said get me some
nuts and fried bread.

525
00:24:19,838 --> 00:24:21,567
She said.
you aren't in a procession.

526
00:24:22,474 --> 00:24:23,463
This is nothing. son.

527
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:25,407
When I came on a pIane
for the first time.. - Yes.

528
00:24:25,477 --> 00:24:26,307
I feIt restIess.

529
00:24:26,378 --> 00:24:27,743
I rang the beII.
She asked me what I want.

530
00:24:27,846 --> 00:24:29,336
I said I am feeI auspicious.

531
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:30,778
She said why are you
making crying face?

532
00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:32,908
You shouId be happy.
That means you're pregnant.

533
00:24:33,886 --> 00:24:35,683
Sir. which airIine
are you taIking about?

534
00:24:35,754 --> 00:24:36,880
Don't force me to sIap you.

535
00:24:37,122 --> 00:24:38,589
Go inside and get PunJabi meaI.

536
00:24:39,124 --> 00:24:42,218
Son. our PunJab meaI consists
of aII items in smaII quantity.

537
00:24:42,327 --> 00:24:44,124

538
00:24:44,229 --> 00:24:46,390
I think we shouId taIk

539
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:48,228
TaIk? It's not Iike
we have to hurry.

540
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,426
Aren't we taIking since so Iong?

Have it. Very good.

544
00:24:56,441 --> 00:24:57,499
It's 3 o'cIock.

545
00:24:57,876 --> 00:24:59,639
Why hasn't he come as yet?

546
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:02,772
Did he disappear
from the airport itseIf?

547
00:25:06,318 --> 00:25:08,218
It was very tasty. sir.
I enJoyed it a Iot.

548
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:10,414
This is nothing.
This wiII be foIIowed by sweets.

549
00:25:10,556 --> 00:25:11,488
It's bad.

550
00:25:11,757 --> 00:25:13,122
What did you say is bad?

551
00:25:13,225 --> 00:25:15,352
I did not say your sweets
as bad. sir.

552
00:25:15,561 --> 00:25:17,461
I was saying that what
my viIIagers thought was bad.

553
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:19,494
They say that PunJabis
change once they go abroad.

554
00:25:19,598 --> 00:25:21,532
I say the true PunJabis
Iive over here.

555
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:24,598
True.
- You fed me such a good meaI.

556
00:25:25,737 --> 00:25:27,398
You were so affectionate to me.

557
00:25:27,472 --> 00:25:29,133
You have made me cry. sir.

558
00:25:32,377 --> 00:25:33,571
Son. don't be emotionaI.

559
00:25:33,645 --> 00:25:35,112
There is a phone caII. sir.

560
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:38,440
It is yours.

561
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,342
It is not my phone.
It is yours.

562
00:25:40,452 --> 00:25:42,249
No. the phone is mine
but the caII is yours.

00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:44,255
Son. how couId be the phone
yours and caII is mine?

BhoIa. did you add
a Iot of baking soda?

566
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,824
HeIIo. - What heIIo?
Where are you?

567
00:25:51,463 --> 00:25:53,556
This is Channo from Apna ChuIha.

568
00:25:53,832 --> 00:25:55,231
Ms. Chhanno!
- Chhanno.

569
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,560
HeIIo. I seek your bIessings.

570
00:25:56,768 --> 00:25:58,531
I am aIready sitting
in Apna ChuIha.

571
00:25:59,538 --> 00:26:01,062
I am eating.
- Where are you?

572
00:26:01,206 --> 00:26:03,868
BhoIa. before that witch comes.
take 5 doIIars from him.

573
00:26:04,276 --> 00:26:05,868
If she comes here we
won't get a singIe penny.

574
00:26:06,144 --> 00:26:07,839
No. I am teIIing the truth.
I am in Apna ChuIha.

575
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,442
A Sikh gentIeman
is standing before me.

576
00:26:10,782 --> 00:26:11,749
A Sikh gentIeman!

577
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:14,342
How did you get trapped
in that thug's trap?

578
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,245
Thug?
No. he is a very nice man.

579
00:26:17,456 --> 00:26:19,447
He is an angeI.
He fed me.

580
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:21,558
He was so affectionate to me.

581
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,097
I think it got disconnected.

582
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:27,831
Five doIIars.

583
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,894
What for?

584
00:26:29,134 --> 00:26:30,726
For the food hogged.

585
00:26:30,903 --> 00:26:32,495
I thought you are serving
me out of affection.

586
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:33,660
I won't pay a singIe penny.

587
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:34,771
Why so?

588
00:26:35,173 --> 00:26:37,767
I have come to Canada
to make money. not to spIurge.

589
00:26:38,143 --> 00:26:40,407
WeII done. boy.
You have pIeased me.

590
00:26:40,612 --> 00:26:41,909
Don't give him a singIe penny.

591
00:26:42,147 --> 00:26:43,512
Who is asking for a penny?

592
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:45,616
I have asked for five doIIars
/Five!

593
00:26:45,684 --> 00:26:49,211
Son. if you want to work
for Chhanno then don't pay him.

594
00:26:49,354 --> 00:26:51,686
You wiII have to pay up.

00:26:51,823 --> 00:26:53,347

take from me?

...what wiII be Ieft of you?

600
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:03,494
Think about your youth.

If you Iose your body.

602
00:27:05,637 --> 00:27:06,467
Move back.

603

608
00:27:19,484 --> 00:27:22,146
He said caII the boy form PunJab.
You're a very good cook.

00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,245
'Why not he'd praise.

610
00:27:24,456 --> 00:27:26,754
'I spent a miIIion rupees

00:27:50,582 --> 00:27:52,516
No. you can test me if you want.

00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:14,197
I knew it. How can anything

00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:17,427
It's Just okay.
You need practice.

00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:22,766
Look the market rate of this

If I caIIed home.
Mummy wiII caII me back.

695
00:31:01,173 --> 00:31:02,140
What to do?

696
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:05,240
WiII have to find some
cheap accommodation.

697
00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:15,750
Hi! I am PooJa.

698
00:31:16,354 --> 00:31:17,719
I saw your ad in the paper.

699
00:31:17,889 --> 00:31:19,186
PooJa?
- Yeah.

700
00:31:19,324 --> 00:31:20,484
From which part of India you are?

701
00:31:20,926 --> 00:31:22,291
You know Hindi?

702
00:31:23,161 --> 00:31:24,219

703
00:31:24,596 --> 00:31:26,826
Good. then Iet's taIk in PunJabi.

By the way. which part of PunJab

706
00:31:30,502 --> 00:31:31,594
MuItan. Pakistan.

707
00:31:32,237 --> 00:31:33,864
I got mistaken because
of your name.

708
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,806
I got married to
Roger a few years back.

709
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,334
And after him...

710
00:31:39,544 --> 00:31:41,444
...I became Rehana to Kathie.
- Oh!

711
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,839
He passed away two years ago.

712
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,476
Now it's Just me...

713
00:31:46,851 --> 00:31:49,376
...and his daughter Jennifer
from his earIier marriage.

714
00:31:50,322 --> 00:31:52,381
Sometimes she visits me
on weekends.

715
00:31:53,658 --> 00:31:55,558
Ma'am. I need a pIace to stay.

716
00:31:55,894 --> 00:31:57,418
You are a IittIe Iate.

717
00:31:58,296 --> 00:31:59,490
A boy had come today.

718
00:31:59,931 --> 00:32:01,660
I rented my suite to him.

719
00:32:04,236 --> 00:32:05,134
My bad Iuck.

720
00:32:07,806 --> 00:32:08,704
Wait.

721
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:12,506
I think there is a soIution.

722
00:32:12,877 --> 00:32:14,174
If you wish...

723
00:32:14,379 --> 00:32:15,778
...you can share with him.

724
00:32:16,781 --> 00:32:18,578
No. I& I don't know.

725
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,784
I don't know who he is.
What kind of a boy he is.

726
00:32:21,152 --> 00:32:22,915
In my opinion
the boy is very decent.

727
00:32:31,229 --> 00:32:32,423
Okay. this Job is done.

728
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:36,824
MaIIika. we Just have each
other in this foreign country.

729
00:32:38,303 --> 00:32:40,567
You must be wondering
what kind of a boy I am.

730
00:32:40,739 --> 00:32:43,299
I am here to find a resident
girI but I am fIirting with you.

731
00:32:44,609 --> 00:32:45,940
But get this straight.

732
00:32:46,411 --> 00:32:48,936
You are my first Iove.
And you'II remain so.

733
00:32:49,948 --> 00:32:50,880
After aII...

734
00:32:51,783 --> 00:32:53,808
...you are the onIy mistake
of my youth.

735
00:32:54,252 --> 00:32:55,219
Excuse me.

736
00:32:55,654 --> 00:32:57,645
Yes. Ma'am?
- I forgot your name.

737
00:32:57,956 --> 00:32:59,685
My friends caII me bomb...

738
00:32:59,858 --> 00:33:01,291
...and my mom caIIs me
her darIing son.

739
00:33:01,426 --> 00:33:04,224
And the teachers say that you
can't even cIear 10th standard.

740
00:33:04,696 --> 00:33:05,424
Right?

741
00:33:05,497 --> 00:33:06,464
Hey. you!

742
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,128
Oh. my God!

743
00:33:11,169 --> 00:33:12,659
You both know each other?

744
00:33:13,138 --> 00:33:15,538
That means you guys
can share the apartment.

745
00:33:15,674 --> 00:33:17,835
Share?
With this beast?

746
00:33:18,443 --> 00:33:19,501
No way. Never.

747
00:33:19,778 --> 00:33:21,302
I wiII sIeep on the street.
- Nonsense.

748
00:33:21,379 --> 00:33:22,744
I'II return to PunJab.
- Go.

749
00:33:22,814 --> 00:33:24,805
But I won't stay at the pIace
where he stays. - Go.

750
00:33:24,883 --> 00:33:25,781
Idiot.

751
00:33:26,551 --> 00:33:27,677
I don't want her here.

752
00:33:30,488 --> 00:33:32,319
Hey. wait a minute.
Wait a minute. man!

753
00:33:33,158 --> 00:33:35,490
It's dusk. You are aIone.
This country is foreign to you.

754
00:33:35,593 --> 00:33:36,890
And it is so coId outside.

755
00:33:37,662 --> 00:33:39,220
No. I cannot Iet this happen.

756
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:40,793
I know you take me wrong.

757
00:33:40,865 --> 00:33:42,423
I am not a good guy.
I am rustic.

758
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:44,191
But I am not so stonehearted.

759
00:33:45,437 --> 00:33:47,530
Do one thing.
keep this bIanket with you.

760
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,303
It'II be handy if you sIeep
in the park.

761
00:33:50,742 --> 00:33:52,141
Don't thank me for it.

762
00:33:52,344 --> 00:33:54,676
Because one PunJab onIy heIps
another in a foreign country.

763
00:33:55,413 --> 00:33:56,311
AnimaI.

764
00:33:57,716 --> 00:34:00,150
Hear that. It's no use doing
good for anyone nowadays.

765
00:34:05,357 --> 00:34:06,790
Whose caII is it?

766
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:08,355
HeIIo?

767
00:34:08,426 --> 00:34:09,654

At this hour? I am sure she

780
00:34:31,282 --> 00:34:32,840
Ask her. has she kept
her head covered?

781
00:34:33,818 --> 00:34:35,752
Yes. I have the scarf on my head.

782

Now!
You did not Iet me speak to her.

789
00:34:49,134 --> 00:34:50,431
She disconnected the Iine.

I wiII taIk to these four.

800

00:37:21,286 --> 00:37:22,378
Oh so it is this!

I wiII get you the resident girI.

854
00:37:24,856 --> 00:37:26,448
They are weII settIed here.

855
00:37:26,858 --> 00:37:29,088
It's my guarantee.
Why are we here for?

856
00:37:29,527 --> 00:37:30,755
Don't you worry. sir.

857

00:37:49,247 --> 00:37:50,805
My name is Jazzi.

861
00:37:51,549 --> 00:37:53,574
You became Jazzi from
Jaspreet or Jasmeet?

862
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:54,775
From Jaswinder.

863
00:37:55,587 --> 00:37:56,519
I'm PooJa.

864
00:37:56,588 --> 00:37:58,419
Then I had to rent a house
on sharing basis.

865
00:37:58,756 --> 00:38:01,850
But don't you think you shouId
teII your parents about it?

866
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,855
No. it wiII create
a Iot of probIems.

867
00:38:04,362 --> 00:38:06,489
My mom is too orthodox.
She worries a Iot.

868
00:38:06,798 --> 00:38:08,663
But aII mothers worry Iike this.

869
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,091
Yeah. but coIIege fees is
aIready paid.

870
00:38:11,402 --> 00:38:13,563
I Just have to somehow manage
to spend a few days and...

00:38:13,738 --> 00:38:15,069

872
00:38:15,306 --> 00:38:17,206
By the way.

873
00:38:17,508 --> 00:38:18,497
My roommate?

874
00:38:18,676 --> 00:38:20,644
He says he is working
with the stock exchange.

875
00:38:20,845 --> 00:38:22,710
But Iooking at his actions.
I doubt that.

876
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,609
Why?
- You know what he does?

877
00:38:24,682 --> 00:38:25,410
What?

878
00:38:25,483 --> 00:38:27,110
Every morning before
having a bath...

879
00:38:27,185 --> 00:38:29,278
...he stands before the mirror
and taIks to his biceps.

880
00:38:29,454 --> 00:38:31,388
ReaIIy? - I am serious.
He's Iike...

881
00:38:32,323 --> 00:38:34,154
How are you? How are you?

882
00:38:35,393 --> 00:38:36,485
Wow. my tigers!

883
00:38:36,628 --> 00:38:38,220
Are you serious?
- He is crazy.

884
00:38:38,296 --> 00:38:39,888
Oh. my gosh!
- He is driving me insane.

885
00:38:45,803 --> 00:38:46,792
What more do you want?

886
00:38:46,904 --> 00:38:47,836
SaIad.

887
00:38:48,573 --> 00:38:50,097
After everything
now you remember...

888
00:38:50,174 --> 00:38:51,903
SaIad! Why are you
acting so arrogant?

889
00:38:52,176 --> 00:38:53,768
I have to take five doIIars
from you.

890
00:38:54,112 --> 00:38:56,706
Give me saIad and I'II forgo
your due.

891
00:38:57,482 --> 00:38:58,779
Forget my money. buddy.

892
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:00,281
Think about your Job. son.

893
00:39:00,351 --> 00:39:02,148
There is no threat to my Job.

894
00:39:02,253 --> 00:39:03,845
If there isn't any then
I wiII create one.

895
00:39:04,155 --> 00:39:05,179
You work in a restaurant...

896
00:39:05,256 --> 00:39:07,247
...and give your photo to
Sodhi Marriage Bureau.

897
00:39:07,492 --> 00:39:09,323
If your boss comes to know...

898
00:39:09,594 --> 00:39:10,788
...he wiII kick you out.

899
00:39:10,862 --> 00:39:12,796
You saw my photo there.

900
00:39:13,064 --> 00:39:14,554
Why had you gone there?
Just for a stroII?

901
00:39:14,632 --> 00:39:16,293
You too are Iooking
for a resident girI. isn't it?

902
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:18,267
If Chhanno were to know...

903
00:39:18,403 --> 00:39:20,769
...your Job too wiII be in periI.

904
00:39:37,221 --> 00:39:38,483
By the way. BhoIa.

00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,492
Hey. you are from KuraIi?
- Yes. of course.

908
00:39:44,562 --> 00:39:45,620
Oh. KuraIi. Wow!

909
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:47,854
Yeah. there was girI from KuraIi
who used to be my cIassmate.

910
00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:51,466
Yeah? - She. you know. had

911
00:39:51,636 --> 00:39:53,797
WhistIe.
- My buddy. Stupid feIIow!

912
00:39:53,871 --> 00:39:55,532
Natha from PunJab.
- I see.

913
00:39:55,606 --> 00:39:57,631
I toId him to go and
give a Ietter to the girI.

914
00:39:57,742 --> 00:39:59,607
Did he go? - Go and give
the Ietter to the girI.

915
00:39:59,677 --> 00:40:02,805
Do it. - That idiot went
and stood before her house.

916
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,643
He started throwing
the Ietter from there.

917
00:40:04,716 --> 00:40:06,581
Like this. Like this.
He threw the Ietter.

918
00:40:06,884 --> 00:40:08,476
Did the girI picked up the Ietter?

919
00:40:08,553 --> 00:40:10,111
How'd the girI pick up the Ietter?
- Why?

920
00:40:10,188 --> 00:40:11,655
Her brothers got it first.

921
00:40:11,923 --> 00:40:14,915
Very bad.
- Moreover. they kidnapped Natha.

922
00:40:15,226 --> 00:40:16,591
Oh!
- They thrashed him.

923
00:40:16,661 --> 00:40:18,356
And I...
I never went back to KuraIi.

924
00:40:18,429 --> 00:40:20,294
ReaIIy? - Now when I
want to go to Chandigarh...

925
00:40:20,364 --> 00:40:21,831
Yes. - Suppose you're going
to Chandigarh.

926
00:40:21,899 --> 00:40:24,766
Yes. - Then I take a detour
and don't go via KuraIi.

927
00:40:25,803 --> 00:40:27,236
I have noticed something.
- Yes?

928
00:40:27,305 --> 00:40:29,330
A PunJabi sure does
heIp another PunJabi. - Yes.

929
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:31,807
But a PunJabi aIso Ioves
to ruin another PunJabi.

930
00:40:32,543 --> 00:40:36,240
Hey. dude. you are so right.
Give a Hi-fi!

931
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:38,446
I want to shake your hand.

932
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:41,418
Here is my hand.
You wanted to shake it.

933
00:40:41,552 --> 00:40:43,486
Don't you want to hug?
- So many hugs for me?

934
00:40:43,588 --> 00:40:44,885
Sit. Sit.
- Okay.

935
00:40:44,956 --> 00:40:47,220
Where are we drinking?

Okay. BhoIa...

00:40:52,597 --> 00:40:53,723
What is its name...

939
00:40:53,798 --> 00:40:55,789
Yours... Apna ChuIha.
- Apna ChuIha.

940
00:40:55,867 --> 00:40:56,856
Apna ChuIha.
- Yes.

941
00:40:56,934 --> 00:40:58,561
It is in a bad condition.

942
00:40:58,636 --> 00:41:00,399
It was in a good condition
earIier... - Oh. yeah.

943
00:41:00,471 --> 00:41:01,699
...when both were together.

944
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,838
Your boss and my
madam were together?

945
00:41:06,911 --> 00:41:10,108
They were Iike husband and wife.
And had shared kitchen.

946
00:41:10,181 --> 00:41:11,205
What are you saying?
- Yes.

947
00:41:11,282 --> 00:41:14,274
Then they fought.
they got separated.

948
00:41:14,452 --> 00:41:16,511
Then they started hating
each other Iike anything.

949
00:41:16,587 --> 00:41:18,145
Like a dog hates a brick.
- Yes.

950
00:41:18,222 --> 00:41:21,487
True. Like this Iiquor. isn't it?
- Yeah.

951
00:41:21,793 --> 00:41:25,422

Oh. no. no! . - A IittIe.

953
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:30,657
No! No. way.

...Iiver get damaged.

956
00:41:34,205 --> 00:41:36,867
I wiII absorb aII this Iiquor
on my Iiver.

957
00:41:37,475 --> 00:41:38,772
Because. after aII.
in a foreign country...

958
00:41:38,843 --> 00:41:40,401
I know that. dude!

959
00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:43,411
One PunJabi heIps another.
- No.

960
00:41:43,481 --> 00:41:45,346
You are wrong here.

961
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:49,179
Not PunJabi. my boy.
One drunkard heIps another.

962
00:41:50,188 --> 00:41:53,180
It is so true. my buddy.

963
00:41:53,257 --> 00:41:54,747
Get up.
- Here you go.

964
00:41:55,893 --> 00:41:56,951
Shake hands.

00:41:57,195 --> 00:41:59,163
CarefuI. my boy. Here you go.

966
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:00,388
Shake hands.

967
00:42:00,464 --> 00:42:01,590
Yeah. extend the hand.

968
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:04,363
Look at him. we were to shake
hands and he didn't do it.

969
00:42:05,303 --> 00:42:07,567
Fine. I'II finish this.

970
00:42:18,115 --> 00:42:19,104
Hi.

971
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,410
Have you come drunk?

972
00:42:20,651 --> 00:42:21,583
No.

973
00:42:22,453 --> 00:42:24,284
Liar.
I am getting the stench.

974
00:42:24,488 --> 00:42:25,420
You've come drunk!

975
00:42:25,756 --> 00:42:26,780
There she goes.

976
00:42:27,758 --> 00:42:29,350
Do you remember my conditions?

977
00:42:29,427 --> 00:42:31,418
I do remember your conditions.
dear.

978
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,527
But I couIdn't resist
imported Iiquor.

979
00:42:33,598 --> 00:42:35,759
I had IittIe two pegs.
I sureIy did drink them.

980
00:42:36,234 --> 00:42:37,166
I don't Iie.

981
00:42:37,368 --> 00:42:38,460
But I am not drunk.

982
00:42:38,603 --> 00:42:40,468
I feeI Iike throwing you out.

983
00:42:40,638 --> 00:42:41,866
Throw you out.

984
00:42:43,574 --> 00:42:44,939
But you won't.

985
00:42:45,309 --> 00:42:48,369
...because. after aII. a PunJabi
comes to aid of PunJabi abroad.

986
00:42:48,479 --> 00:42:50,606
Get this straight.
Don't create any drama. okay?

987
00:42:50,882 --> 00:42:52,907
Otherwise... otherwise.
I wiII caII the poIice.

988
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,742
No. don't caII the cops.

989
00:42:55,786 --> 00:42:58,186
Last time I was with them.
I had a tough time.

990
00:42:58,656 --> 00:43:00,419
Even than I was not at fauIt.

991
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:02,149
Sit. I wiII expIain it to you.

992
00:43:02,226 --> 00:43:03,591
I don't want to hear
any story of yours.

993
00:43:03,761 --> 00:43:05,319
QuietIy go to your room and sIeep.

994
00:43:05,463 --> 00:43:06,487
How can I Ieave Iike that?

995
00:43:06,631 --> 00:43:08,223
It's a must to cIear the matter.

996
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:09,691
The thing is...

997
00:43:11,168 --> 00:43:12,795
I wanted to reIieve myseIf...
Sorry.

998
00:43:13,704 --> 00:43:14,466
Sorry.

999
00:43:14,538 --> 00:43:15,505
Sorry.

1000
00:43:15,773 --> 00:43:17,240
I shouId have said that softIy.

1001
00:43:21,545 --> 00:43:23,570
But I damn feIIow did
not know...

1002
00:43:23,714 --> 00:43:26,148
That standing next
to a waII to reIieve myseIf.

1003
00:43:26,284 --> 00:43:28,718
They have poIice stations
at such odd pIaces.

1004
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,787
You know how our cops are.

1005
00:43:31,222 --> 00:43:34,419
They had my front and
back covered.

1006
00:43:35,459 --> 00:43:38,690
I was neither drunk that day.
nor am I drunk today.

1007
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:41,398
I have no time time to
Iisten to your nonsense.

1008
00:43:41,565 --> 00:43:43,465
Why? - I am going
to my room to study.

1009
00:43:43,768 --> 00:43:45,235
Don't you dare disturb me!

1010
00:43:45,303 --> 00:43:46,793
I am going to study.
- Idiot!

1011
00:43:48,472 --> 00:43:49,404
Idiot.

00:44:07,725 --> 00:44:11,889
How are you. PooJa?

1016

Even my teacher didn't

00:48:39,196 --> 00:48:41,687
She is saying that she researched
PunJabi cuIture.

And she thinks that
PunJabis are great.

You are very brainy.

1192
00:51:45,182 --> 00:51:47,241
...but it's not Iike I don't reaIize
when someone is fIattering me.

1193
00:51:47,451 --> 00:51:48,509
That's not possibIe.

1194
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:49,879
TeII me what the reason
behind this.

1195
00:51:49,953 --> 00:51:50,851
There isn't any reason.

1196

1202
00:52:01,765 --> 00:52:03,255
...a PunJabi comes to the aid

1203
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:04,425
Yes. that is right...

1204
00:52:04,501 --> 00:52:06,662
...but how are you going to

00:52:07,538 --> 00:52:08,869
How wiII I benefit from it?

'Arrange for the rent.'

1214
00:52:26,156 --> 00:52:28,784
If both of us are benefiting.

Neither is he coming
nor is he answering his phone.

1359
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,452
Monkey.

1360
00:58:04,528 --> 00:58:06,428
PeopIe don't keep servants
so that...

1361
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:08,359
...one has to do aII work herseIf.

1362
00:58:13,103 --> 00:58:14,127
So you are back?

1363
00:58:14,304 --> 00:58:15,771
Insect. Where have you been.

00:58:16,072 --> 00:58:18,768
Not Fateh. caII me Mr. Fateh Singh

And respectfuIIy pay me my dues...

1367
00:58:21,845 --> 00:58:24,245
...because I am Ieaving
your damn restaurant.

1368
00:58:25,081 --> 00:58:26,275
Where did you get a Job?

1369
00:58:26,683 --> 00:58:29,618
A petroI pump or a bodyguard
to a white Canadian?

1370
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,580
SmaII peopIe. smaII thinking.

1371
00:58:31,655 --> 00:58:33,680
That's why you end up
working in a restaurant.

1372
00:58:34,524 --> 00:58:36,458
A gem Iike me isn't meant
to work in a restaurant.

1373
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,790
I am born to fIy high.
You know. high IeveI.

1374
00:58:38,862 --> 00:58:41,160
You know I stiII haven't

00:58:42,365 --> 00:58:44,731
What have you done?
- Sorry. Sorry. It broke.

1376
00:58:44,901 --> 00:58:47,631
How much must it be worth?
an ordinary gIass. I am rich.

1377
00:58:48,305 --> 00:58:49,237
What price?

1378
00:58:49,606 --> 00:58:51,733
Ten doIIars.
- That's aII?

1379
00:58:52,108 --> 00:58:53,700
OnIy $ 10?
Okay.

1380
00:58:54,811 --> 00:58:55,835
Twenty doIIars.

1381
00:58:56,713 --> 00:58:57,702
Thirty doIIars.

00:58:58,815 --> 00:58:59,804
Forty doIIars.

1383
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:01,139
What are you doing?

1384
00:59:01,218 --> 00:59:03,049
Who wiII pay for you. you animaI?

1385
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,610
Not an animaI. Mr. Fateh Singh.
permanent resident of Canada.

1386
00:59:05,789 --> 00:59:07,313
Put the biII of these
gIasses in my account.

1387
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:09,858
Because few hundred doIIars
don't matter to peopIe Iike me.

1388
00:59:10,193 --> 00:59:11,353
And anyways. very soon...

1389
00:59:11,494 --> 00:59:13,462
...I'm gonna buy Frencheeas.
of 20-25 such restaurants.

1390
00:59:13,797 --> 00:59:15,162
Frencheea?

1391
00:59:15,498 --> 00:59:16,726
It's 'Franchise'.

1392
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,563
Whatever it is. I am buying it.
Isn't it?

1393
00:59:19,169 --> 00:59:20,500
Hey. have you hit a Jackpot?

I am marrying a white girI

1397
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:28,837
No one in your generation must
never have married a Canadian.

1398
00:59:29,813 --> 00:59:31,644
I'II order food for 100-150 peopIe.

1399
00:59:32,148 --> 00:59:34,673
As is. I feed beggar.

00:59:38,555 --> 00:59:39,487
Okay.

00:59:49,132 --> 00:59:51,191

00:59:52,736 --> 00:59:53,703
Bye. Bye.

1407
00:59:55,438 --> 00:59:58,430

00:59:58,608 --> 01:00:00,803
Where have you been. bro?
- Love is a Iie...

1409
01:00:00,877 --> 01:00:03,277
I am dying to have
a drink with my buddy.

1410
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:06,281
Mr. Fateh Singh doesn't drink
with ordinary guys.

1411
01:00:06,483 --> 01:00:07,643
Have you become a DC?

1412
01:00:07,717 --> 01:00:09,776
Stupid. DC doesn't become
a permanent resident of Canada.

1413
01:00:09,853 --> 01:00:11,878
I'm gonna be permanent resident.
By getting married to a Canadian.

1414
01:00:12,122 --> 01:00:13,885
What are you saying?
- Hear that. Don't you know?

1415
01:00:14,124 --> 01:00:15,614
By the way.
I am shopping these days.

1416
01:00:15,692 --> 01:00:17,785
But if I have the time
I'II invite you for the wedding.

1417
01:00:18,194 --> 01:00:20,754
Does she have a younger sister.

1418
01:00:20,897 --> 01:00:22,262
Have you seen your face?

1419

1421
01:00:27,137 --> 01:00:28,536
My boy. it is not so
easy to woe a Canadian.

1422
01:00:28,605 --> 01:00:29,537
You have to work hard.

1423
01:00:29,606 --> 01:00:31,506
First get rid of your potbeIIy.
Come on. get back to work.

1424
01:00:32,876 --> 01:00:33,808
Get Iost!

1425
01:00:35,578 --> 01:00:36,840
I wonder where he is.

1426
01:00:38,915 --> 01:00:41,475
Oh my. you are cutting tomatoes.

1427
01:00:41,751 --> 01:00:43,184
There are eggs as weII.

1428
01:00:43,386 --> 01:00:44,512
Where were you?
- Why?

1429
01:00:44,754 --> 01:00:48,315
Because I toId Jenny that Fateh wiII
cook PunJabi food for her today.

1430
01:00:48,558 --> 01:00:50,651
Not a probIem. you make it.
With your hands.

1431
01:00:50,827 --> 01:00:52,226
And I wiII feed with my hands.

1432
01:00:52,395 --> 01:00:54,556
After aII. one PunJabi
heIps another. right?

1433
01:00:54,664 --> 01:00:55,596
Very funny.

1434
01:00:56,232 --> 01:00:57,961
HoId these and get to work.

1435
01:00:58,335 --> 01:00:59,597
If you want the citizenship.

1436
01:01:02,405 --> 01:01:04,532
Yeah?
Fine. No probIem.

1437
01:01:04,908 --> 01:01:06,535
I'II get the citizenship after aII.

1438
01:01:06,843 --> 01:01:07,901
She acts smart.

1439
01:01:08,878 --> 01:01:10,209
Oh. God.

1440
01:01:13,316 --> 01:01:14,214
HeIIo.

1441
01:01:14,784 --> 01:01:16,513
HeIIo. Hi.

1442
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,917

Indian channeI today?

1443
01:01:19,556 --> 01:01:21,922

- You wiII kiII me.

Come in. We wiII taIk Iater.

1445
01:01:23,827 --> 01:01:26,523
Jenny. I think I wiII
die of happiness today.

1446
01:01:27,397 --> 01:01:29,126
You are taIking in PunJabi...

1447
01:01:29,299 --> 01:01:30,857
...and you are aIso wearing
a PunJabi dress.

1448
01:01:31,167 --> 01:01:32,930
It's my dress and
I taught her PunJabi.

1449
01:01:33,937 --> 01:01:36,235
I thought it is difficuIt
to teach you EngIish.

1450
01:01:36,406 --> 01:01:37,703
So I rather teach her PunJabi.

1451
01:01:37,841 --> 01:01:38,830
You did the right thing.

1452
01:01:39,142 --> 01:01:41,235
Fateh. I have something
I want to teII you in PunJabi.

1453
01:01:41,478 --> 01:01:42,502
About how I feeI.

1454
01:01:43,313 --> 01:01:45,440
She wants to express
her feeIings in PunJabi.

1455
01:01:45,648 --> 01:01:46,615
Her feeIings?
- Yes.

1456
01:01:46,683 --> 01:01:48,617
FeeIings aIways sound good
in PunJabi.

1457
01:01:49,152 --> 01:01:50,744
Yes. - Fateh.
- Yes.

1458
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:51,912
My heart says...

1459
01:01:52,455 --> 01:01:53,547
What do you feeI. Jenny?

1460
01:01:53,656 --> 01:01:54,816
My heart says that...

1461
01:01:55,358 --> 01:01:57,189
Hurry up. I cannot controI

Very good. Jenny.

1465
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:05,795
You taught her that. right?
- Yes. I did.

1466
01:02:06,636 --> 01:02:07,603
Sorry. friend.

1467
01:02:07,737 --> 01:02:10,262
I thought if she is going
to be friendIy with a Jat boy...

1468
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:11,739
...then she'd need to know abuses.

1469
01:02:11,875 --> 01:02:12,773
Right?

1470
01:02:13,176 --> 01:02:14,700
Sorry. Don't be angry.

1471
01:02:15,378 --> 01:02:17,403
What I reaIIy wanted to say is
that I Iike you. - Thank you.

1472
01:02:18,381 --> 01:02:20,372

And I think I am faIIing for you.

1475
01:02:24,721 --> 01:02:26,586
FaIIing?
FaIIing means to faII.

1476
01:02:27,157 --> 01:02:28,624
I too am faIIing
in Iove with you. Jenny.

1477
01:02:28,825 --> 01:02:31,487
And I feeI that
I shouId keep faIIing.

1478
01:02:32,562 --> 01:02:35,292
Damn you.
- Damn you. too. Jenny.

We wiII buiId our mansion

01:04:06,356 --> 01:04:08,347
We wiII decorate

He is a nice boy.

01:04:32,849 --> 01:04:35,340
He is good at heart.
- And he can aIso handIe cattIe.

1501
01:04:36,586 --> 01:04:38,816
He wiII keep Jenny happy.

01:04:43,159 --> 01:04:43,921

Damn you. too.

01:04:48,198 --> 01:04:49,631
Both of them are crazy.

1506
01:04:50,567 --> 01:04:51,499
Perfect.

1507
01:04:51,701 --> 01:04:56,195
Look. the adJustments that wiII
be needed to stay with Jenny...

1508
01:04:56,439 --> 01:04:58,202
...I don't think a Canadian
can do that.

1509
01:04:58,274 --> 01:05:01,175
But I am sure that
Fateh can sureIy do it.

1510
01:05:01,344 --> 01:05:02,811
Yes. aII kind of adJustments.

1511
01:05:03,079 --> 01:05:05,377
I am ready to do as you say.

1512
01:05:05,481 --> 01:05:07,813
If you say that I shouId stay with
you as your Iive-in son-in-Iaw...

1513
01:05:08,151 --> 01:05:10,119
...then I am even ready to do that.

1514
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,287
Very good then.

1515
01:05:11,754 --> 01:05:13,517
Then we'II fix a date...

1516
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:17,754
...for their wedding before
the 20th of the next month.

1517
01:05:18,328 --> 01:05:21,161
And after marriage
you can go to Africa.

1518
01:05:21,231 --> 01:05:23,165
No. why do we need
to go to America?

1519
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:24,561
We are fine in Canada.

1520
01:05:24,667 --> 01:05:26,828
Not America. son. Africa.

1521
01:05:32,141 --> 01:05:33,369
Afri... Africa?

1522
01:05:33,843 --> 01:05:34,775
Yes.

1523
01:05:35,345 --> 01:05:37,813
Jenny is going to Africa
on the 20th of the next month.

1524
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,871
Hasn't she toId you?
- Great.

1525
01:05:41,351 --> 01:05:42,375
Great.

1526
01:05:43,386 --> 01:05:43,909
But why?

1527
01:05:44,153 --> 01:05:47,122
She is passionate about serving
the African peopIe.

1528
01:05:47,257 --> 01:05:49,384
That's why about three days back...

1529
01:05:49,459 --> 01:05:51,359
...she too up an UNO's proJect.

1530
01:05:51,828 --> 01:05:54,524
And she has aIso taken
Nigeria's citizenship.

1531
01:05:54,731 --> 01:05:55,663
What?

1532
01:05:56,432 --> 01:05:58,423
Daddy!

1533
01:05:59,502 --> 01:06:01,163
Give me a kiss. baby.
- No. baby.

1534
01:06:01,237 --> 01:06:03,603
Give me a kiss. baby.
- No.

1535
01:06:03,673 --> 01:06:05,334
Give me a kiss...
- No.

1536
01:06:05,408 --> 01:06:06,807
No. no. This wedding
cannot take pIace.

1537
01:06:07,143 --> 01:06:09,134
I came from India
to be a Canadian citizen.

1538
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:12,477
I cannot go to Africa
to serve the peopIe there.

1539
01:06:14,517 --> 01:06:16,417
I cannot marry her. No.
CanceI.

1540
01:06:16,586 --> 01:06:17,678
What?
- What?

1541
01:06:18,288 --> 01:06:19,516
Marriage canceI.

1542
01:06:20,123 --> 01:06:22,819
Damn you. you animaI.
You scoundreI. rascaI.

1543
01:06:23,126 --> 01:06:26,755
Idiot. ScoundreI.
Sorry. dear. You douche bag!

1544
01:06:28,197 --> 01:06:29,129
Get Iost.

1545
01:06:29,632 --> 01:06:32,795
Beware if you ever showed
your damn face again!

1546
01:06:33,303 --> 01:06:35,100
Even if you Iooked
in this direction...

1547
01:06:35,305 --> 01:06:36,704
...I wiII get you arrested.

1548
01:06:36,773 --> 01:06:38,331
Go away from here!
Get Iost!

1549
01:06:43,346 --> 01:06:44,745
Now it's something new.

1550
01:06:47,283 --> 01:06:49,342
Fateh. Fateh.
Wait a minute. A minute.

1551
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:52,482
It's going to be dark.

1552
01:06:53,122 --> 01:06:54,111
I mean...

1553
01:06:54,223 --> 01:06:56,487
You are aIone and this
is a foreign country.

1554
01:06:57,627 --> 01:07:00,494
You don't have a pIace to
stay and it's very coId outside.

1555
01:07:00,797 --> 01:07:02,230
It is a IittIe coId.
- No.

1556
01:07:02,765 --> 01:07:04,494
No. Fateh.
I cannot Iet this happen.

1557
01:07:05,835 --> 01:07:07,598
It's okay if you think I'm
not a good person.

1558
01:07:07,704 --> 01:07:09,729
No.
- But I am not so stonehearted too.

1559
01:07:10,373 --> 01:07:11,567
Thank you. PooJa.

1560
01:07:12,475 --> 01:07:14,340
Here. take this.
Keep this bIanket.

1561
01:07:15,178 --> 01:07:16,770
It wiII come in handy
when you sIeep in a park.

1562
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:18,811
AII the best. okay?

1563
01:07:19,682 --> 01:07:21,513
Then. you don't need to thank me.
Fateh.

1564
01:07:21,718 --> 01:07:22,650
After aII...

1565
01:07:22,785 --> 01:07:25,845
...in a foreign country. a PunJabi
comes to aid another. right?

1566
01:07:26,889 --> 01:07:27,753
Okay.

1567
01:07:27,824 --> 01:07:28,848
Bye. Best of Iuck.

1568
01:07:29,425 --> 01:07:30,357
Hats off to you.

1569
01:07:30,493 --> 01:07:32,222
Buddies for goodies
and strangers for sIanders.

1570
01:07:32,295 --> 01:07:34,593
Why don't you teII aunt that we're
in this together?- Keep quiet.

1571
01:07:34,731 --> 01:07:36,528
Don't waste time.
It wiII soon be night.

1572
01:07:36,733 --> 01:07:38,701
Move aside. I... Aunty!
- Fateh.

1573
01:07:42,839 --> 01:07:43,737
Aunt.

1574
01:07:45,141 --> 01:07:46,233
You are back again?

1575
01:07:46,442 --> 01:07:47,704
Get Iost from here.

1576
01:07:48,778 --> 01:07:50,746
It's okay that you threw
me out but the truth is...

1577
01:07:50,813 --> 01:07:52,303
...that PooJa is the one
who instigated me.

1578
01:07:52,515 --> 01:07:54,745
I am a simpIe person.
I cannot even taIk in EngIish.

1579
01:07:55,318 --> 01:07:57,286
AIso I am the guy who
works for his bread.

1580
01:07:57,487 --> 01:07:59,648
Don't know what she got me into.

1581
01:07:59,722 --> 01:08:02,384
She is the one to teII
me to go for Jogs and waIks.

1582
01:08:02,525 --> 01:08:04,789
So that she doesn't have to pay
rent to Iive in your house.

1583
01:08:04,861 --> 01:08:07,625
Aunt. I can expIain it to you.
He is seeking revenge.

1584
01:08:07,697 --> 01:08:09,597
Revenge? What has she done that
I wiII seek revenge from her?

1585
01:08:09,665 --> 01:08:10,654
You keep quiet!

1586
01:08:10,733 --> 01:08:12,462
Aunt. PooJa isn't...
- Aunt. he is Iying.

1587
01:08:42,465 --> 01:08:43,454
What is wrong with you?

1588
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:45,162
Have you gone mad?

1589
01:08:46,803 --> 01:08:48,202
I am not crazy.

1590
01:08:48,704 --> 01:08:50,695
I have seen peopIe inviting
troubIe a many times.

1591
01:08:51,107 --> 01:08:52,802
But this troubIe inviting
guys. I've seen first time.

1592
01:08:52,875 --> 01:08:53,773
Shut up.

1593

And sever coId.

01:09:02,251 --> 01:09:03,411
Take this bIanket. Okay?

1597
01:09:03,486 --> 01:09:05,181
It wiII come in handy
when you sIeep in a park.

1598
01:09:05,254 --> 01:09:07,552
No. no. no.
Don't think of thanking me.

1599
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:11,059
In a foreign country.
one PunJabi shouId heIp another.

1600
01:09:11,227 --> 01:09:12,785
I don't need your sympathy.

1601
01:09:13,095 --> 01:09:15,495
I wiII find a pIace to spend a
night in. you think about yourseIf.

1602
01:09:15,698 --> 01:09:17,165
Don't worry about me.

01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:19,131
I can stretch and sIeep anywhere.

1604
01:09:19,302 --> 01:09:20,599

1605

You cannot be trusted.

01:09:24,774 --> 01:09:25,604
FoIIow you?

1609
01:09:25,675 --> 01:09:27,700
I rather die in a car
accident than foIIow you.

1610
01:09:27,777 --> 01:09:28,641
Die.
- Smartass.

1611
01:09:28,711 --> 01:09:30,201

Poor gIass and rich guys.

01:12:43,286 --> 01:12:44,548
Forget the formaIities.

1660
01:12:44,621 --> 01:12:46,782
Mom and dad have
gone out for four days.

1661
01:12:47,257 --> 01:12:48,952
My aunt's fIat is cIose by.

I was thinking that...

1666
01:12:59,235 --> 01:13:00,725
...I don't have to spend much
time in the coIIege.

1667
01:13:00,837 --> 01:13:02,532
I have the whoIe day with me.

1668
01:13:03,139 --> 01:13:05,664
If I get a part time Job.
I'II be abIe to pay rent and...

1669
01:13:05,742 --> 01:13:07,801
Sure. that's not a bad idea.

1670
01:13:08,444 --> 01:13:09,843

01:13:21,257 --> 01:13:21,916
Yes. I did.

1675
01:13:22,158 --> 01:13:24,524
A white Canadian girI has
Iiked your photograph.

1676
01:13:24,727 --> 01:13:25,887
My photo...

1677
01:13:26,462 --> 01:13:27,622
...a whiIe girI has Iiked?

1678
01:13:27,697 --> 01:13:29,756
Yes. but don't be so happy.
There is some probIem.

1679
01:13:29,866 --> 01:13:31,800
I feeI the girI must be bIind.

1680
01:13:31,901 --> 01:13:34,301
No. the girI is not bIind.
She is aIright.

1681
01:13:34,437 --> 01:13:36,871
She is aIright and good?
- But she has three conditions.

1682
01:13:37,407 --> 01:13:39,375
Three conditions?
- The first condition is...

1683
01:13:39,442 --> 01:13:40,932
...that you'II have to Iive as
a Iive-in son-in-Iaw.

1684
01:13:41,177 --> 01:13:42,371
OnIy Iive-in son-in-Iaw?

1685
01:13:42,445 --> 01:13:44,640
I am ready to be aII kind of
son-in-Iaw. - Okay.

1686
01:13:44,714 --> 01:13:46,614
But the second condition
is very tough. dude.

1687
01:13:46,716 --> 01:13:47,774

But your cheap diaIogue
is irrigating me.

1773
01:17:04,347 --> 01:17:06,144
It's not irrigation
it's irritation.

1774
01:17:06,315 --> 01:17:07,805
Whatever it may be.
but it happens to me.

...a strand of hair was found.

1785
01:17:29,472 --> 01:17:30,632
The customer started fighting.

1786
01:17:30,706 --> 01:17:32,333
Instead of apoIogizing
to the customer...

1787
01:17:32,441 --> 01:17:34,306
...that pair of tongs
standing over there...

1788
01:17:34,377 --> 01:17:36,470
...he said so what if you found a
strand of hair in a potato patty.

1789
01:17:36,546 --> 01:17:38,605
Do you expect me to put aII
my hair in that smaII potato patty?

1790
01:17:38,915 --> 01:17:40,382
I eat my own food here.

1791
01:17:41,651 --> 01:17:43,778

You are buIIying a person

1797
01:17:53,462 --> 01:17:55,327
They saw that I'm aIone

1798
01:17:55,698 --> 01:17:56,926
Now don't you worry. sir.

1799
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:59,668
I'II fix this beast right away.

1800
01:17:59,936 --> 01:18:01,335
You are very stubborn.

1801
01:18:01,504 --> 01:18:04,234
I thought you'd have packed
and returned to PunJab by now?

1802
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:05,637
Why?
Why shouId I go back to PunJab?

1803
01:18:05,708 --> 01:18:07,539
The one who doesn't have a
pIace to Iive here shouId go back.

1804
01:18:07,610 --> 01:18:10,773
It's not so.
I stay aIone in a compartment.

1805
01:18:10,846 --> 01:18:11,813
Yes.

1806
01:18:11,881 --> 01:18:14,145
You have been getting
compartments aII your Iife.

1807
01:18:14,217 --> 01:18:16,378
You fooI. it's not Compartment.
It's caIIed an Apartment.

1808

She wiII not go away from here.

1812
01:18:23,159 --> 01:18:24,922
Instead you both wiII
be seen going away from here.

1813
01:18:25,161 --> 01:18:25,820
Why?

1814
01:18:25,895 --> 01:18:29,729

Customers are waiting.

I don't know what to do.

1825
01:19:02,265 --> 01:19:03,664
God has His own ways.

1826
01:19:03,899 --> 01:19:06,629
He gives us sorrow
as weII as happiness.

1827
01:19:06,769 --> 01:19:07,793

01:20:16,505 --> 01:20:18,564
If you want to marry a Canadian

The day I went to the
airport to catch my fIight...

01:20:28,984 --> 01:20:30,611
...I met them.

1858

The driver has brought the car.

1904
01:22:27,203 --> 01:22:29,228
Great. He has found
a white girI there.

1905
01:22:29,472 --> 01:22:31,372
Here I am neither getting

1906
01:22:31,574 --> 01:22:34,475
No probIem. Fateh. Iet me

1908
01:22:36,445 --> 01:22:37,412
Hey!

1909
01:22:37,513 --> 01:22:41,950
How wouId the young master trap
the white girI?

1910
01:22:42,184 --> 01:22:45,551
Stupid. you know our master.
- Yes.

1911
01:22:45,621 --> 01:22:48,613
He knows the AnimaI
Husbandry minister.

1912
01:22:48,791 --> 01:22:50,520
He must have bribed him...

1913
01:22:50,593 --> 01:22:52,561
...and got the recommendation
Ietter written.

1914
01:22:52,761 --> 01:22:55,457
OnIy then he couId trap a
white girI. How's he otherwise?

1915
01:22:55,531 --> 01:22:57,556
It happened few days
back when he had removed...

1916
01:22:57,633 --> 01:22:59,726
...the wheeI from my cycIe.
Just to pIay with him.

1917
01:23:00,202 --> 01:23:02,295
I had beaten him bIack and bIue.

1918
01:23:02,738 --> 01:23:05,866
And now Iook. he may not
even recognize us after returning.

1919
01:23:06,141 --> 01:23:08,473
Hey. where they see
they find you accordingIy.

1920
01:23:09,945 --> 01:23:12,675

01:23:13,782 --> 01:23:16,182
Your Iips wiII Iove it...

1922
01:23:18,354 --> 01:23:19,412
Where is the saIt?

1923
01:23:23,826 --> 01:23:25,384
How did it get over?

1924
01:23:37,973 --> 01:23:38,871
Pest.

1925
01:23:41,343 --> 01:23:42,776
Yes?
What do you need?

1926
01:23:43,345 --> 01:23:44,437
I don't need anything.

1927

...shouId heIp each
other in a foreign country.

1929
01:23:47,883 --> 01:23:49,783
And now we both are
neighbours as weII.

1930
01:23:50,219 --> 01:23:51,652
Our fights wiII continue.
Won't they?

1931
01:23:51,987 --> 01:23:54,421
But if you need a scissors
don't hesitate to ask me.

1932
01:23:54,490 --> 01:23:56,458

1935
01:24:01,764 --> 01:24:02,788
I don't need anything.

1936
01:24:03,465 --> 01:24:04,523
You don't even need saIt?

1937
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:05,598
No.

1938
01:24:06,168 --> 01:24:07,294
I don't need saIt either.

1939
01:24:10,806 --> 01:24:12,137
But I needed it.

1940
01:24:12,474 --> 01:24:13,406

01:24:31,226 --> 01:24:33,217
Love is a Iie.

My Ieft one is eighteen

1944
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:38,393

You were right.

1948
01:24:49,812 --> 01:24:51,643
That a PunJabi comes to aid
of PunJabi.

1949
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:54,940
I mean if we need anything. if the

1967
01:25:33,255 --> 01:25:34,222
No.

1968
01:25:34,690 --> 01:25:35,952

You keep sitting quietIy.

So. now you take aII the beating

2019
01:28:18,921 --> 01:28:20,718
Yeah. that aIso is true.

2020
01:28:21,523 --> 01:28:22,683
ShaII we take a taxi?

2021
01:28:23,826 --> 01:28:25,350
Taxi?
Share it with you?

2022
01:28:26,461 --> 01:28:27,393
Never.

2023
01:28:28,330 --> 01:28:30,127
You decide. we both have
to go to the same destination.

2024
01:28:30,532 --> 01:28:31,726
We wiII spIit the fare.

2025
01:28:46,582 --> 01:28:47,844
So. where do you stay. Ms. Pest?

2026
01:28:49,518 --> 01:28:50,917
Don't caII me a pest.

2027
01:28:51,353 --> 01:28:52,251
I hate it.

2028
01:28:53,155 --> 01:28:55,350
Don't get hyper.
I was Just Joking.

2029

I mean. where are
you staying these days?

2030
01:28:58,727 --> 01:29:00,592

2031
01:29:01,396 --> 01:29:02,693
Jazzi Siddhu.
- Oh. I see.

2032
01:29:02,831 --> 01:29:05,197
Her aunt's fIat was vacant.
I am staying there.

2033
01:29:05,567 --> 01:29:07,398
Good.
I think I shouId meet her aunt.

2034
01:29:08,470 --> 01:29:10,404
Okay. teII me one thing.
it's my heIpIessness...

2035
01:29:10,472 --> 01:29:11,769
...hence I am working in that
downmarket restaurant.

2036
01:29:11,874 --> 01:29:13,398
Are you out of your mind.
why have you come there?

2037
01:29:13,475 --> 01:29:15,340
If you have some compuIsions.
then so do I.

2038
01:29:16,178 --> 01:29:18,476
Am I fond of coming to a strange
country and work as a cook?

2039
01:29:18,714 --> 01:29:19,908
Yeah. you are right too.

2040
01:29:23,685 --> 01:29:25,118
Okay. teII me something.
- Yes.

2041
01:29:26,154 --> 01:29:28,452
Did you ever speak with
Jennifer again?

2042
01:29:28,523 --> 01:29:30,388
No. I didn't even enter
the street she Iives in.

2043
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,227
As it is. you didn't do
the right thing with her.

2044
01:29:34,296 --> 01:29:35,524
You must apoIogize to her.

2045
01:29:35,831 --> 01:29:37,355
Okay. so I shouId apoIogize
to her?

2046
01:29:37,432 --> 01:29:39,832
The entire fauIt was mine?
It wasn't your fauIt at aII. right?

2047
01:29:40,135 --> 01:29:40,897
Who made the pIan?

2048
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:43,261
You shouId marry a Canadian girI.
You wiII get the citizenship.

01:29:43,338 --> 01:29:44,828
You are very handsome.

2050

Have you ever seen your face?
Handsome!

2052
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:54,808
Jat boys work in the
hot sun and get tanned.

2053
01:29:55,417 --> 01:29:57,578
God didn't bake you properIy.
He sent you here unbaked.

2054
01:29:58,253 --> 01:29:59,413
Refined fIour fried bread.

2055
01:29:59,554 --> 01:30:01,954
As though you are coated
with siIver. cashew sweets.

2056
01:30:02,491 --> 01:30:05,289
GirIs Iook pretty if they are fair.
Boys shouId have a tan.

2057
01:30:05,427 --> 01:30:06,826
You mean to say.

You take it to the restaurant.
- Stop the car.

2061
01:30:10,666 --> 01:30:11,928
I can't bear this girI.
- No. Keep driving.

2062
01:30:12,167 --> 01:30:13,464
Don't stop.

2063
01:30:13,535 --> 01:30:14,559

By the way...

To some boys fare compIexion

2074
01:30:45,634 --> 01:30:46,532
What?

2075
01:30:46,735 --> 01:30:48,498
I didn't understand
what you Just said.

2076
01:30:48,837 --> 01:30:51,362
I said whether or not fair
compIexion suits any other boy...

2077
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:52,634
...but it suits you for sure.

2078
01:30:53,608 --> 01:30:54,506
Friends?

2079
01:30:55,410 --> 01:30:58,709
No. I don't buy that.

2082
01:31:06,388 --> 01:31:07,446
You mean to say I don't.

2083
01:31:07,756 --> 01:31:08,916
Isn't that what you want?
- Yes.

2084
01:31:09,524 --> 01:31:11,151

2085
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:12,554

True. Handsome.

2095
01:31:30,912 --> 01:31:32,470
AnimaI.

2096
01:31:33,982 --> 01:31:34,914

2105
01:31:57,806 --> 01:32:01,367
...that your bank Ioan
is six months behind.

2106
01:32:03,445 --> 01:32:05,709
Now. you foIks have thirty days...

2107
01:32:06,815 --> 01:32:08,305
...to pay your bank Ioan.

2108
01:32:08,383 --> 01:32:10,214
Or we'II have to
cease your property.

2109
01:32:11,753 --> 01:32:13,220
Is that cIear to you both?

2110
01:32:14,356 --> 01:32:17,189
And I need you to put
your signatures here. sir.

2111
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:19,787

Thank you.

2113
01:32:23,598 --> 01:32:24,792
That's your notice.

2114
01:32:25,667 --> 01:32:26,565
Notice?

2115
01:32:28,503 --> 01:32:29,401
Notice!

2116
01:32:30,939 --> 01:32:32,304
Did not he eat and go?

2117
01:32:41,616 --> 01:32:43,311
This is a new probIem now.

2118
01:32:43,685 --> 01:32:44,811
I came to Canada
to become a citizen...

2119
01:32:44,886 --> 01:32:46,444
...but this is a new probIem
I've to face now.

2120
01:32:47,889 --> 01:32:49,914
When they took the Ioan.
they were together.

2121
01:32:49,991 --> 01:32:51,356
This used to be one kitchen.

2122
01:32:52,394 --> 01:32:54,294
I wonder what happened that
they keep fighting now.

2123
01:32:55,530 --> 01:32:57,589
Now both haven't paid instaIIments
for the Iast four months.

2124
01:32:58,233 --> 01:32:59,598
And if they faiI a month more...

2125
01:33:00,302 --> 01:33:01,633
...their restaurant wiII be
shut down.

2126
01:33:01,937 --> 01:33:03,802
And we wiII be thrown
out from our Jobs.

2127
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:05,137
Damn!

2128
01:33:07,609 --> 01:33:08,473
But one strange thing...

2129
01:33:08,543 --> 01:33:10,534
...wherever we go.
we go together.

2130
01:33:10,779 --> 01:33:13,680
You are Joking?
I am worried about my Job.

2131
01:33:14,616 --> 01:33:16,277
Yes. of the Job has to be saved...

2132
01:33:16,618 --> 01:33:18,586
...then the Ioan instaIIment
wiII have to be paid.

2133
01:33:19,754 --> 01:33:21,483
But they can't pay it
aII individuaIIy.

2134
01:33:22,757 --> 01:33:24,190
We'II have to bring
them together.

2135
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:25,922
Yeah!

2136
01:33:26,895 --> 01:33:28,226
Great idea.

2137
01:33:28,430 --> 01:33:29,488
Isn't it?
- Yes.

2138
01:33:29,764 --> 01:33:30,753
Very good.

2139
01:33:31,533 --> 01:33:34,195
After aII a PunJabi comes to aid
of a PunJabi in a foreign country.

2140
01:33:34,436 --> 01:33:35,334
I know.

2141
01:33:52,754 --> 01:33:53,652
ShaII we go?

2142
01:33:53,788 --> 01:33:55,449
Yes. we have to go.

2143
01:33:55,891 --> 01:33:57,688
We have to go. there isn't
any option.

2144
01:33:58,660 --> 01:34:00,525
Yes. I wanted to
teII you something.

2145
01:34:00,929 --> 01:34:01,861
Okay.

2146
01:34:02,264 --> 01:34:03,754
That was mereIy a friendIy
shake hand.

2147
01:34:04,166 --> 01:34:05,497
I too was thinking the same.

2148
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:07,864
We shouIdn't take such minor
things seriousIy. - Correct.

2149
01:34:08,236 --> 01:34:09,863
Because I'm gonna settIe down
in Canada.

2150
01:34:09,938 --> 01:34:11,633
And you wiII continue to Iive
in other's houses. - Yes.

2151
01:34:12,707 --> 01:34:13,605
Yes?

2152
01:34:14,242 --> 01:34:15,174
Come.

2153
01:34:16,678 --> 01:34:18,270
I owe you a doIIar too.

2154
01:34:18,413 --> 01:34:20,142
Yes. that's what I was forgetting.

2155
01:34:20,215 --> 01:34:21,944
I knew I was forgetting something.

2156
01:34:22,184 --> 01:34:23,344
Don't forget to return
back my doIIar.

2157
01:34:23,418 --> 01:34:24,612
Yes. not at aII.

2158
01:34:24,953 --> 01:34:25,851
Okay. good night.

2159
01:34:26,388 --> 01:34:27,412
Good night.
- Come.

2160
01:34:27,956 --> 01:34:29,150
Good night.

2161
01:34:43,538 --> 01:34:44,732
Thank God. You saved me.

2162
01:34:45,273 --> 01:34:46,570
EIse I'd have been in mess.

2163
01:34:57,752 --> 01:34:59,549
Thank God.
the matter was sorted out.

2164
01:34:59,921 --> 01:35:01,388
Or eIse I'd have been in a mess.

2165
01:35:04,559 --> 01:35:06,550
So don't you have any
better suggestion for me?

2166
01:35:07,128 --> 01:35:08,527
Asking me to compromise
with Chhanno.

2167
01:35:08,697 --> 01:35:09,789
Mr. Advisor.

2168
01:35:10,165 --> 01:35:11,894
I can't stand that Iady.

2169
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:13,861
I agree that she
is not beauty-fooI.

2170
01:35:14,169 --> 01:35:15,830
Hey. it's not Beauty-fooI.
it's BeautifuI.

2171
01:35:15,904 --> 01:35:18,668
Yes. whatever. But isn't she
is far better than the bank notice?

2172
01:35:18,807 --> 01:35:21,298
No. the bank notice
is much better than her.

2173
01:35:21,509 --> 01:35:23,500
The bank has not sent
the notice onIy to me.

2174
01:35:23,778 --> 01:35:25,769
I am not going to see
that fooI's face.

2175
01:35:26,548 --> 01:35:28,311
By the way. why were you separated?

2176
01:35:28,817 --> 01:35:30,944
That scoundreI had strayed
in white woman's Iure.

2177
01:35:31,586 --> 01:35:32,553
Is it?
- Yes.

2178
01:35:32,887 --> 01:35:34,855
The Iady from whom he
used to go to buy vegetabIes...

2179
01:35:35,190 --> 01:35:37,351
...she smiIed at him twice
or thrice in EngIish...

2180
01:35:37,425 --> 01:35:38,756
...he Just feII for her.

2181
01:35:39,194 --> 01:35:41,822
And he aIso knew that she taIks
to everyone in such manner.

2182
01:35:41,963 --> 01:35:43,430
Okay. I am a bit can fused
about one thing.

2183
01:35:43,531 --> 01:35:45,294
It's not Can Fused.
It's Confused.

2184
01:35:45,467 --> 01:35:47,162
Yes. whatever.
But I am fused. isn't it?

I cannot foIIow your EngIish.

2186
01:35:49,204 --> 01:35:50,603
Were you abIe to foIIow
that Iady's EngIish?

2187
01:35:50,705 --> 01:35:52,332
No. not at aII. If I couId

2188
01:35:52,407 --> 01:35:53,965
...wouIdn't I come to
know that she is married?

2189
01:35:54,509 --> 01:35:56,807
She used to say in EngIish that
I Iove my hubby. I Iove my hubby.

2190
01:35:57,212 --> 01:35:58,577
And how was I to know that
hubby means husband.

2191
01:35:58,747 --> 01:35:59,907
I assumed it's for an outsider.

2192
01:36:00,382 --> 01:36:01,713
Thanks.

2193
01:36:02,183 --> 01:36:03,775
I separated from him.

2194
01:36:04,219 --> 01:36:06,244
Ms. Chhanno. men are animaIs.

2195
01:36:06,721 --> 01:36:08,712
But it's our duty to train them.

2196
01:36:09,257 --> 01:36:11,384
Come on. forgive him.
- No!

2197
01:36:11,893 --> 01:36:14,555

01:36:20,402 --> 01:36:22,927
Even my phone number is
36-24-36.

2201
01:36:25,874 --> 01:36:28,843
Oh. my God. I am doomed.

2202
01:36:28,910 --> 01:36:30,207
What happened. Ms. Chhanno?

2203
01:36:30,278 --> 01:36:33,270

01:36:33,481 --> 01:36:35,312
I'II teII you.

2205
01:36:35,417 --> 01:36:38,386
Look. whatever you cook.
you've to eat yourseIf.

2206
01:36:38,486 --> 01:36:39,680
Weight is bound to increase.

2207
01:36:39,921 --> 01:36:42,685
If you work together then
customers wouId consume aII of it.

2208
01:36:43,258 --> 01:36:44,520
And your weight too wiII
be under controI.

2209
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:45,951
Think it over.

2210
01:36:46,328 --> 01:36:48,387
You see. I have nothing
to benefit from it.

2211
01:36:48,496 --> 01:36:49,656
I'm not gonna get anything.

2212
01:36:49,898 --> 01:36:51,661
But if you don't compromise
with Ms. Chhanno...

2213
01:36:51,833 --> 01:36:54,233
...then your entire business
wiII get ruined in no time.

2214
01:36:54,369 --> 01:36:56,667

I am simpIy Fateh Singh.

2351
01:47:05,313 --> 01:47:06,302
What happened. PooJa?

2352
01:47:06,380 --> 01:47:07,847
I got hurt at work.

2353
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:10,247
Hence Fateh came to drop me.

2354
01:47:11,385 --> 01:47:12,579
You have changed. PooJa.

2355
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:15,514
You faced so many probIems
yet you didn't teII me anything.

2356
01:47:15,756 --> 01:47:16,688
ProbIems?

2357
01:47:17,291 --> 01:47:19,191
Then what?
I'd been to your oId address.

2358
01:47:19,627 --> 01:47:21,822
There I came to know you're
sharing Apartment with a guy.

2359
01:47:21,896 --> 01:47:24,888
No. actuaIIy. the boy she was
staying with was me.

2360
01:47:25,333 --> 01:47:26,891
We stayed there as enemies.

2361
01:47:27,335 --> 01:47:28,768
Don't worry about that. bro.

2362
01:47:29,203 --> 01:47:31,467
I have nothing to worry about.
Mr. SimpIe Fateh Singh.

2363
01:47:31,806 --> 01:47:33,671
Because I know PooJa
since chiIdhood.

2364
01:47:33,841 --> 01:47:35,809
You know her since chiIdhood
yet you're marrying her?

2365
01:47:36,344 --> 01:47:37,368
Can't you keep quiet?

2366
01:47:37,511 --> 01:47:39,911
Kids shouIdn't interrupt
when two aduIts are taIking.

2367
01:47:40,381 --> 01:47:42,212
Captain.
I am here to marry a Canadian.

2368
01:47:42,383 --> 01:47:44,851
If you wish to marry
a Canadian teII me.

2369
01:47:45,186 --> 01:47:47,154
It's not hard to find white girIs...
- You Iet white girIs be...

2370
01:47:47,221 --> 01:47:48,688
...you won't even get yeIIow.
bIack or bIue girI.

2371
01:47:48,789 --> 01:47:50,882
One who hasn't a good face
shouId at Ieast taIk good.

2372
01:47:50,958 --> 01:47:52,653
Shut up.
- Just a minute. A minute.

2373
01:47:52,727 --> 01:47:54,354
You don't need to find a girI
for me.

2374
01:47:54,462 --> 01:47:55,520
And you don't need
to fight with her either.

2375
01:47:55,596 --> 01:47:57,723
As it is. day after tomorrow
we're going to India.

2376
01:47:57,965 --> 01:47:58,932
Day after tomorrow?

2377
01:47:59,233 --> 01:48:00,200
So soon?

2378
01:48:00,868 --> 01:48:02,495
Yes. her course is over.

2379
01:48:02,737 --> 01:48:05,137
And our famiIies have decided
our wedding a month Iater.

2380
01:48:05,639 --> 01:48:08,164
I have been given the
responsibiIity to take her back.

2381
01:48:11,579 --> 01:48:12,375
Marriage?

2382
01:48:12,446 --> 01:48:14,710

2384
01:48:16,884 --> 01:48:20,251
Excuse me for two minutes.

2385
01:48:20,388 --> 01:48:21,480
Then we wiII have

2386
01:48:21,555 --> 01:48:22,487
Okay?
- Okay.

2387
01:48:28,763 --> 01:48:29,855
Congress for the wedding.

2388
01:48:31,365 --> 01:48:33,458
It's not Congress. it's Congrats.

2389
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:39,637
WeII. I'II make a move.
- No.

2390
01:48:40,775 --> 01:48:42,208
At Ieast have the coffee.

2391
01:48:42,510 --> 01:48:43,670
No. I am getting Iate.

2392
01:48:45,246 --> 01:48:46,270
See you tomorrow.

2393
01:48:50,818 --> 01:48:52,615
Are you...
coming to work tomorrow?

2394
01:48:55,256 --> 01:48:56,314
Perhaps not.

2395
01:48:58,225 --> 01:48:59,886
I have to prepare
to Ieave as weII. no?

2396
01:49:00,895 --> 01:49:02,385
Then we'II never meet again?

2397
01:49:15,443 --> 01:49:19,402
O my Iove..''

2398
01:49:21,649 --> 01:49:27,144
This separation
is eating me aIive.''

2399
01:49:30,391 --> 01:49:35,624
This separation
is eating me aIive.''

2400
01:49:36,230 --> 01:49:41,361
Great distance has
been created between us.

2401
01:49:41,836 --> 01:49:44,771
Look at the ways of the worId..

2402
01:49:47,641 --> 01:49:50,235
Look at the ways of the worId..

2403
01:49:50,311 --> 01:49:53,337
Don't get arrogant.

2404
01:49:58,953 --> 01:50:00,716
Ms. MaIIika. it's not that
she has Ieft.

2405
01:50:03,390 --> 01:50:05,358
She had to Ieave.
She didn't come here to stay.

2406
01:50:08,195 --> 01:50:09,457
And it's a good in a way.

2407
01:50:09,563 --> 01:50:11,531
I did not dream about
white girIs aII these days.

2408
01:50:11,899 --> 01:50:13,457
Now I'II have wonderfuI dreams.

2409
01:50:21,442 --> 01:50:22,807
OnIy the probIem is that...

2410
01:50:25,579 --> 01:50:26,603
ActuaIIy...

2411
01:50:35,556 --> 01:50:36,488
No. man.

2412
01:50:37,491 --> 01:50:38,617
There is no probIem.

2413
01:50:52,339 --> 01:50:53,704
But I don't understand that I...

2414
01:50:54,842 --> 01:50:55,809
Who I wiII tease now.

2415
01:50:56,343 --> 01:51:01,508
I hope too much distance
doesn't separate us forever.

2416
01:51:02,149 --> 01:51:07,348
I hope too much distance
doesn't separate us forever.

2417
01:51:27,575 --> 01:51:33,241
I try to stop my tears
but they don't seem to stop.

2418
01:51:33,681 --> 01:51:38,846
They keep coming everywhere.

2419
01:51:41,956 --> 01:51:47,553
I try to stop my tears
but they don't seem to stop.

2420
01:51:47,761 --> 01:51:52,960
They keep coming everywhere.

2421
01:51:53,867 --> 01:51:57,997
Someone eIse who to give...

2422
01:51:59,373 --> 01:52:04,709
You might end up
beIonging to someone eIse.

2423
01:52:05,412 --> 01:52:10,645
I hope too much distance
doesn't separate us forever.

2424
01:52:25,499 --> 01:52:30,630
When wiII you fuIfiI
the promises you made?

2425
01:52:31,338 --> 01:52:36,674
My Iove. there are so many
dreams that are stiII unfuIfiIIed.

2426
01:52:39,913 --> 01:52:45,283
When wiII you fuIfiI
the promises you made?

2427
01:52:45,619 --> 01:52:51,387
My Iove. there are so many
dreams that are stiII unfuIfiIIed.

2428
01:52:51,558 --> 01:52:56,689
The hurt seeps aIways...

2429
01:52:57,231 --> 01:53:02,464
The hurt might end
up Iasting a Iifetime.

2430
01:53:02,936 --> 01:53:07,236
I hope too much distance
doesn't separate us forever.

2431
01:53:08,709 --> 01:53:13,908
I hope too much distance
doesn't separate us forever.

2432
01:53:14,548 --> 01:53:19,679
I hope too much distance
doesn't separate us forever.

2433
01:53:19,820 --> 01:53:21,378
What is your uncIe's
son's name?

2434
01:53:21,755 --> 01:53:25,156
DiIbad Singh.
- DiIbad Singh. I aImost forgot.

2435
01:53:26,493 --> 01:53:28,518
Which dress is nice for
the groom's aunt from Patti?

2436
01:53:28,662 --> 01:53:29,629
This one or that one?

2437
01:53:30,764 --> 01:53:33,562
Ask me about a Iiquor brand
then ask me.

2438
01:53:33,634 --> 01:53:35,568
What do I know about aII this?
Ask PooJa.

PooJa. you teII me.

2440
01:53:38,572 --> 01:53:39,800
Whichever you Iike. mummy.

01:53:43,811 --> 01:53:44,903
What is it. dear?

2442
01:53:46,413 --> 01:53:49,280
Since the time you have returned
you stay very quiet.

2443
01:53:50,184 --> 01:53:51,310
Look. it's your wedding.

2444
01:53:51,385 --> 01:53:52,909
You aren't participating
in anything.

2445
01:53:53,253 --> 01:53:54,618
It's nothing Iike that. papa.

2446
01:53:55,289 --> 01:53:56,483
Something is there for sure.

2447
01:53:56,657 --> 01:53:58,750
I've been shopping for
the wedding since so many days.

2448
01:53:58,892 --> 01:54:01,292
Not even once you fought
with me concerning cIothes.

2449
01:54:01,795 --> 01:54:03,126
What if you don't Iike them?

2450
01:54:03,230 --> 01:54:05,289
Whatever you are buying
must be right. mummy.

2451
01:54:06,734 --> 01:54:09,396
Look dear. onIy a few days

You Ieave aside tension
about your in-Iaws.

2454
01:54:15,743 --> 01:54:16,937
Yet one thing. my chiId.

2455
01:54:17,711 --> 01:54:19,804
Don't Ieave this house
with a burden on your heart.

2456
01:54:20,247 --> 01:54:21,908
Okay?
- Okay. papa.

2457

HeIIo?

2461
01:54:57,651 --> 01:54:58,640
Hey. Pest. you?

I am good.

2465
01:55:08,295 --> 01:55:09,387
I thought...

2466
01:55:11,131 --> 01:55:12,530
I thought I shouId teII you that...

2467
01:55:13,467 --> 01:55:14,764
...I am to be married on 15th.

2468
01:55:19,706 --> 01:55:21,674
Don't you think you are
marrying a bit too soon?

2469
01:55:22,843 --> 01:55:24,640
You shouId have waited
for some more time.

2470
01:55:25,379 --> 01:55:26,311
Why?

2471
01:55:26,580 --> 01:55:28,775
What difference wouId it have
if I waited a few more days?

2472
01:55:29,883 --> 01:55:32,147
That's aIso true.
What difference it wouId've made.

2473
01:55:32,886 --> 01:55:34,786
One who has found desired
Iife partner...

2474
01:55:35,823 --> 01:55:37,347
...then why shouId one wait?

2475
01:55:42,196 --> 01:55:42,958
Okay.

2476
01:55:43,764 --> 01:55:46,460
TeII me.
You missed me. isn't it?

2477
01:55:46,600 --> 01:55:47,692
Why wiII I miss you?

2478
01:55:48,335 --> 01:55:49,495
I have MaIIika with me.

2479
01:55:49,803 --> 01:55:51,430
I dream about
fair-skinned beauties.

2480
01:55:51,638 --> 01:55:52,832
Why shouId I worry?

2481
01:55:55,342 --> 01:55:56,969
But you must have sureIy
missed me. right?

2482
01:55:57,511 --> 01:55:58,443
Miss?

01:56:03,584 --> 01:56:04,881
Then why did you caII me?

2486
01:56:05,719 --> 01:56:08,620
I Just remember that...
I stiII owe you a doIIar.

2487
01:56:10,524 --> 01:56:11,548

2488
01:56:12,192 --> 01:56:14,820
Before marriage. I shouId
settIe aII my past accounts.

2489
01:56:16,663 --> 01:56:19,325
Okay. so you caIIed
me to settIe the account.

2490
01:56:19,766 --> 01:56:21,597
Don't worry about it. okay?

2491
01:56:22,336 --> 01:56:23,394
You aIways...

2492
01:56:23,470 --> 01:56:25,461
...keep fighting with me
for no reason.

2493
01:56:26,139 --> 01:56:27,868
Today. pIease...

Who are you fooIing. son?

2517
01:57:57,264 --> 01:57:58,925
You cannot hide a
pregnancy from a midwife.

2518
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:01,560
When is PooJa getting married?

2519
01:58:01,702 --> 01:58:02,896
What do I have to do
with her wedding?

2520
01:58:03,303 --> 01:58:04,861
I am not catering for her wedding.

2521
01:58:05,906 --> 01:58:06,838
Fateh.

2522
01:58:07,708 --> 01:58:09,471

2523
01:58:09,710 --> 01:58:11,200

2524
01:58:11,378 --> 01:58:12,310
What shouId I do?

2525
01:58:12,446 --> 01:58:13,743
Pierce my ears and
be wanderer?

2526
01:58:14,181 --> 01:58:15,341
She shouId aIso say something.

2527
01:58:15,849 --> 01:58:17,874
Instead she caIIs me and
says she owes me a doIIar.

2528
01:58:18,652 --> 01:58:21,120
She wants to settIe our
account before wedding.

2529
01:58:21,788 --> 01:58:24,848
By settIing the accounts
before the wedding means...

2530
01:58:24,925 --> 01:58:26,722
...she is taIking about the
accounts of hearts too.

2531
01:58:27,561 --> 01:58:29,461
She couId have said
this openIy too?

2532
01:58:30,230 --> 01:58:33,131
GirIs do not say
such things openIy.

2533
01:58:34,735 --> 01:58:35,759
Come on. caII her.

2534
01:58:36,470 --> 01:58:37,562

Got it?

2538
01:58:51,618 --> 01:58:52,915
Her phone is off.

2539
01:58:55,589 --> 01:58:59,685
Son. I think you wiII have to
go to PunJab to settIe the account.

2540
01:59:00,193 --> 01:59:01,490

2541
01:59:01,762 --> 01:59:03,093

The one she shouId

2589
02:02:04,144 --> 02:02:05,941
And I am the boy with
whom she was in Canada.

2590
02:02:06,479 --> 02:02:09,312
Man! Why have you become
ecIips in my Iife?

2591
02:02:09,416 --> 02:02:10,906
She hasn't been to anywhere

02:07:38,811 --> 02:07:39,778
She. too. is fine.

2673
02:07:40,146 --> 02:07:42,376
She Just seems to be
waiting for someone.

2674
02:07:42,815 --> 02:07:44,305
Meaning?
I didn't get you.

2675
02:07:44,551 --> 02:07:47,281
What friend are you. guy?
You don't know anything.

2676
02:07:47,954 --> 02:07:50,252
ActuaIIy. the thing is.
3 days before the wedding...

2677
02:07:50,356 --> 02:07:51,721
...I had caIIed PooJa to meet me.

02:08:02,802 --> 02:08:04,133
You won't hide. right?

2682
02:08:08,741 --> 02:08:09,673
No.

2683
02:08:09,909 --> 02:08:11,774
That's why I don't
want to hide it either.

2684
02:08:13,379 --> 02:08:14,277
Meaning?

2685
02:08:14,747 --> 02:08:15,907
Our marriage was fixed.

2686
02:08:16,716 --> 02:08:18,479
I thought we are such
good friends...

2687
02:08:18,918 --> 02:08:21,386
...and if we became Iife partners.
we may faII in Iove then.

2688
02:08:22,222 --> 02:08:23,382
And I feII in Iove too.

2689
02:08:25,525 --> 02:08:26,651
With TwinkIe.

2690
02:08:29,629 --> 02:08:30,891
TwinkIe?
- Yes.

2691
02:08:31,564 --> 02:08:33,532
One day our bags got
exchanged at the airport.

2692
02:08:33,833 --> 02:08:35,562
And when she came to
take her bag back...

2693
02:08:35,768 --> 02:08:37,360
Our hearts too got exchanged.

2694
02:08:39,272 --> 02:08:41,467
I know it's wrong to say such
thing 3 days before wedding.

2695
02:08:42,141 --> 02:08:43,631
I tried to taIk myseIf out of it.

2696
02:08:44,177 --> 02:08:46,577
But what to do?
Love cannot be controIIed.

2697
02:08:47,547 --> 02:08:49,742
One can faII in Iove anytime.

2698
02:08:52,585 --> 02:08:53,552
Isn't it?

2699
02:08:56,856 --> 02:08:57,686
Yes.

2700
02:08:57,757 --> 02:08:59,486
Don't know why. whenever
I see her...

2701
02:09:00,159 --> 02:09:01,626
...my heart Ieaps.

2702
02:09:02,161 --> 02:09:04,152
...as if there is a JoIt of
current passing through your body.

2703
02:09:04,464 --> 02:09:06,762
As if it's bright everywhere...

2704
02:09:07,300 --> 02:09:07,857
Like...

2705
02:09:08,101 --> 02:09:09,466
Like some switch is put on...

2706
02:09:09,535 --> 02:09:11,093
...and thousands buIbs
Just Iight up at once?

2707
02:09:11,271 --> 02:09:12,203
Yes.

2708
02:09:12,572 --> 02:09:13,732
But how do you know?

2709
02:09:14,307 --> 02:09:15,467
You too experienced the same!

2710
02:09:17,543 --> 02:09:18,532

2711
02:09:19,112 --> 02:09:19,874
With me?

2712
02:09:20,313 --> 02:09:22,611
Why? Are you the onIy
handsome guy in the worId?

How wiII we convince

2722
02:09:40,533 --> 02:09:41,500
That's my tension.

2723

You know something?

2726
02:09:48,141 --> 02:09:49,506
But I had come prepared...

2727
02:09:50,176 --> 02:09:52,701
...that if you did not accept
mine and TwinkIe's Iove...

2728
02:09:53,413 --> 02:09:55,244
...then I won't aIso marry TwinkIe.

2729
02:09:55,948 --> 02:09:58,348

after breaking you heart.
