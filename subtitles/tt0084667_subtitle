1
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:29,158
Bless you, son.

2
00:01:29,668 --> 00:01:31,159
Grandpa!

3
00:01:46,686 --> 00:01:48,346
Well, all right.

4
00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:52,022
It is a noble thought.

5
00:01:53,692 --> 00:01:55,683
But it isn't going to be easy.

6
00:01:57,197 --> 00:02:02,191
Life gets tough with those...

7
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:08,204
who choose the true path.

8
00:02:10,743 --> 00:02:12,735
But that's just what
you did, Grandpa.

9
00:02:13,546 --> 00:02:15,538
You were one of the greatest
police officers of all time.

10
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:18,539
And that's just what I'm going
to do. I'll take the exams.

11
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:21,713
Ravi... I've told you not to
disturb your grandpa.

12
00:02:22,556 --> 00:02:25,718
Now off you go to bed.
And let him go to sleep too.

13
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:28,050
He'll go to bed soon enough.

14
00:02:28,728 --> 00:02:33,391
He has just come home today
after his graduation exams.

15
00:02:34,568 --> 00:02:37,401
Now he stands on the
threshold of life.

16
00:02:38,405 --> 00:02:42,397
I'd rather tell him a few
important things right away.

17
00:02:43,576 --> 00:02:45,568
You could talk tomorrow.

18
00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:51,240
Have you spoken to your mother
about it, Ravi?

19
00:02:52,085 --> 00:02:55,576
I did. She told me what
you have been saying.

20
00:02:58,592 --> 00:03:01,584
Did you face trying times,
Grandpa?

21
00:03:06,932 --> 00:03:08,924
It was trying indeed.

22
00:03:10,437 --> 00:03:12,598
The test was tough.

23
00:03:13,272 --> 00:03:14,763
But you have never told me
anything about it.

24
00:03:19,445 --> 00:03:24,782
You were young. I wondered
if you might understand it all.

25
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,454
That is why I haven't
spoken to you about...

26
00:03:30,556 --> 00:03:32,456
... me and my son.

27
00:03:33,293 --> 00:03:36,626
Your son... that means my
father... right Grandpa?

28
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:46,461
Oh yes! It was my son Vijay
who fathered you.

29
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:51,633
I'll tell you everything
tonight.

30
00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:55,306
Everything about him and me.

31
00:03:57,317 --> 00:04:01,651
You have the right to
know what happened.

32
00:04:15,335 --> 00:04:17,326
Well, I...
- Who is that, nurse?

33
00:04:17,504 --> 00:04:19,495
A policeman! What do you want?

34
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:22,005
No! Not the police!

35
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:25,338
Oh Sheetal! Why don't
you tell her...

36
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,841
Let him come inside.

37
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:38,016
Why did you have to bring me
so many flowers?

38
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:43,692
That's one question
I knew you'd ask.

39
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:47,362
But tell me how you are.

40
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:51,026
I'm fine. And I'm so glad.

41
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:56,372
I'm proud to have
given you a son.

42
00:04:57,043 --> 00:05:00,375
Strange of me not to have
thanked you yet...

43
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,538
... for giving me a son.

44
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:11,050
Won't you take a look
at your son?

45
00:05:11,391 --> 00:05:13,382
Only after I have seen you
to my heart's content.

46
00:05:15,495 --> 00:05:18,896
Why keep him covered?

47
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:21,723
He's asleep.

48
00:05:22,735 --> 00:05:24,726
- Don't wake him.
- All right! Let him sleep.

49
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:41,418
He's so tiny!

50
00:05:42,254 --> 00:05:43,745
He's just a day old.

51
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:46,581
But, I can't quite make out
what he looks like.

52
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:50,423
That's what it's like.
In a day or two,...

53
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:52,754
... his features will
start coming clear.

54
00:05:58,103 --> 00:06:00,095
Now tell me when
you're coming home.

55
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:02,600
I must get the house in order.

56
00:06:02,776 --> 00:06:06,439
That comes later. First of all,
there's this list of...

57
00:06:06,612 --> 00:06:09,103
... the things he needs.
- Oh I know that.

58
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:11,439
Well what do you know?

59
00:06:11,617 --> 00:06:16,281
We'll need feeding bottles,
nappies, towels...

60
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:21,620
... and what is it you call
that little cart...?

61
00:06:21,795 --> 00:06:23,786
- A pram (perambulator).
- Pram!

62
00:06:55,661 --> 00:07:02,329
My prayers have been answered

63
00:07:11,343 --> 00:07:17,509
My hopes have blossomed

64
00:07:57,223 --> 00:08:03,889
I cared little

65
00:08:16,742 --> 00:08:23,079
But I've been given
a priceless gift

66
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:30,579
Our love has borne fruit

67
00:09:26,312 --> 00:09:32,307
This spring fills
my heart with joy

68
00:09:45,498 --> 00:09:51,835
I have been given
what I prayed for

69
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:59,337
No joy of the heavens
could mean more to me

70
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:36,708
Our information points
to the fact that...

71
00:10:36,816 --> 00:10:40,717
most consignments of smuggled
merchandise lands at the beach.

72
00:10:42,054 --> 00:10:45,717
But we do not know the names
of people who are involved...

73
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:48,384
in smuggling. But we
have come to know...

74
00:10:48,727 --> 00:10:53,562
who their agent is.
His name is Yeswant.

75
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:56,557
This is his photograph.

76
00:10:59,806 --> 00:11:02,070
He is the one who supplies
the boats for the landings.

77
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:07,744
And his men help the smugglers
in the unloading operations.

78
00:11:08,246 --> 00:11:14,913
That solves the problem. Just
arrest Yeswant. He'll speak.

79
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:20,085
It's been 3 months since we were
granted a warrant for his arrest

80
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:23,591
But we haven't been able
to arrest him yet.

81
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:30,091
We know that he lives
somewhere in that area.

82
00:11:30,937 --> 00:11:33,097
Isn't it strange that we haven't
been able to arrest him yet?

83
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,102
The problem is that he
has some men in his pay.

84
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:43,272
The rest are too scared to
inform the police about him.

85
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:47,109
This is the situation

86
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:52,116
Anyway, now that you've
assigned me this case...

87
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:56,283
you'll find this man behind
the bars within 24 hours.

88
00:11:56,962 --> 00:11:59,796
That's a promise.

89
00:13:24,216 --> 00:13:28,210
I'm here to get you, Yeswant.

90
00:13:28,888 --> 00:13:32,379
No cop has ever dared
to walk this street.

91
00:13:34,226 --> 00:13:37,559
You won't get out
of here alive.

92
00:13:38,163 --> 00:13:41,894
I will. And you will
come with me.

93
00:13:43,735 --> 00:13:44,895
To the police station.

94
00:13:45,238 --> 00:13:47,729
Want to take me to
the police station?

95
00:13:49,241 --> 00:13:56,580
As of now, your life
is in my hands.

96
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:03,410
And I have a warrant for
arresting you in my pocket.

97
00:16:07,546 --> 00:16:11,710
I have a way to
get Yeswant out.

98
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:17,552
The ploy is so effective that
Ashwini Kumar, the cop...

99
00:16:19,057 --> 00:16:25,053
who arrested him will
help him to walk out.

100
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,394
Ashwini Kumar doesn't accept
bribes. And you know that.

101
00:16:31,403 --> 00:16:34,567
I also know that Ashwini Kumar
has a son.

102
00:16:37,076 --> 00:16:39,067
His only son.

103
00:16:39,745 --> 00:16:43,578
As a father, he will do
whatever I say...

104
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,745
to save his son.

105
00:16:48,754 --> 00:16:52,245
Vijay... where are you?

106
00:16:52,758 --> 00:16:57,923
I'm here, Mom.
- And what are you doing there?

107
00:16:58,264 --> 00:17:00,926
Looking for my socks.
I can't find my socks.

108
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,431
- Which socks? The white ones?
- Yes.

109
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,092
They were dirty.
I took them for washing.

110
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:08,095
Here you are... clean socks.

111
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:12,769
You forgot your workbook in my
room. It's in your school-bag.

112
00:17:15,614 --> 00:17:17,104
Mama's kid!

113
00:17:17,282 --> 00:17:19,443
Hurry up. Breakfast is ready
and Daddy is waiting for you.

114
00:17:48,146 --> 00:17:49,478
Sheetal!

115
00:17:52,817 --> 00:17:59,154
Vijay! Where are you?
- In the kitchen...

116
00:18:01,493 --> 00:18:03,654
What's going on
in the kitchen?

117
00:18:04,663 --> 00:18:06,653
Cooking... what else?

118
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,990
The cooking can happen later.

119
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:13,499
How about a cup of tea
for your husband?

120
00:18:13,672 --> 00:18:15,663
All right.

121
00:18:16,008 --> 00:18:19,340
French fries! Very good!

122
00:18:19,511 --> 00:18:23,174
That isn't for you.
It's for Vijay. He wanted some.

123
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:26,508
But it's tasty! Very good!

124
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:30,510
Where's Vijay?
- He isn't home yet.

125
00:18:30,689 --> 00:18:32,349
Why not?

126
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:34,516
People at school called to say
that there's a sports event.

127
00:18:34,692 --> 00:18:37,183
He said they'd drop him home
afterwards. I needn't go over.

128
00:18:38,864 --> 00:18:41,355
A call from the school?
- What's this?!

129
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:45,527
So what if I eat a little?

130
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:49,535
Strange! You can't even
eat in this house!

131
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,699
Not potatoes!

132
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:54,536
Why can't I eat potatoes?

133
00:18:54,712 --> 00:18:58,046
You keep after me all the time!
Look at yourself! You're fat!

134
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:03,384
I'm hungry! And this
is a potato-pie!

135
00:19:03,556 --> 00:19:04,545
It's warm! You'll scald
your fingers!

136
00:19:04,656 --> 00:19:06,715
- Is that warm?!
- What a fellow!

137
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,550
You can have that.
And take that call.

138
00:19:09,728 --> 00:19:11,058
All right...

139
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,221
Watch your head!

140
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:17,394
Tea coming up!

141
00:19:22,074 --> 00:19:24,065
Yes. Ashwini speaking.
Who is this?

142
00:19:24,742 --> 00:19:29,737
Forget who I am. But you
might like to know that...

143
00:19:30,915 --> 00:19:34,078
I am holding your son.

144
00:19:35,988 --> 00:19:43,416
Yes! And tell me whether you'd
like to see your son alive.

145
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:46,758
Scoundrel! D'you know
what you are saying?!

146
00:19:47,532 --> 00:19:54,769
I'm holding your son.
And it's you who can save him.

147
00:19:57,276 --> 00:20:03,942
If you want to save you son...

148
00:20:06,117 --> 00:20:08,278
you'll let Yeswant
escape tonight.

149
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,457
What proof that my son
is with you?

150
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,787
You'll have the proof
when you hear your son.

151
00:20:16,628 --> 00:20:18,961
But before that, you will
decide whether...

152
00:20:19,064 --> 00:20:22,124
you accept my terms.
And if you do...

153
00:20:22,634 --> 00:20:25,798
how are you going to
help Yeswant escape?

154
00:20:26,638 --> 00:20:31,804
You have an hour to decide.
I'll call you in an hour.

155
00:20:32,644 --> 00:20:36,808
Here... speak to your son.

156
00:20:39,484 --> 00:20:40,644
Speak!

157
00:20:42,654 --> 00:20:44,987
Yes, son! This is Daddy!

158
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,650
Save me Dad!

159
00:20:48,093 --> 00:20:50,653
Don't worry, son! I'm around.

160
00:20:50,996 --> 00:20:53,828
Daddy won't let anything
happen to you!

161
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,996
No! They are going to kill me!
Save me, Daddy!

162
00:21:13,685 --> 00:21:16,176
What happened?
Who was it on the phone?

163
00:21:20,858 --> 00:21:22,519
What's up?

164
00:21:22,861 --> 00:21:29,699
It was just a phone!

165
00:21:30,702 --> 00:21:35,366
What do you mean?
What's the matter?

166
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:41,035
Nothing! And nothing is going
to happen to Vijay!

167
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:45,042
Let me think...

168
00:21:45,451 --> 00:21:50,548
Where's Vijay?
What has happened to him?

169
00:21:51,056 --> 00:21:55,720
No! Don't hide anything from
me! Tell me! Where's Vijay?!

170
00:21:58,063 --> 00:22:00,895
Sheetal...

171
00:22:03,568 --> 00:22:09,234
Someone has kidnapped our son!

172
00:22:12,411 --> 00:22:14,402
Why?! What for?!

173
00:22:15,748 --> 00:22:20,241
What has my son done?!
What have they against him?!

174
00:22:21,086 --> 00:22:28,423
What do they want?!
- To save my son...

175
00:22:31,096 --> 00:22:36,260
...they want me to let
a criminal escape.

176
00:22:38,936 --> 00:22:45,775
No! I'll kill myself if
anything happens to Vijay!

177
00:22:45,943 --> 00:22:50,438
What are you saying?!
- I don't want to hear anything!

178
00:22:50,782 --> 00:22:53,444
I want my son!

179
00:22:53,786 --> 00:22:55,946
Do you realise what
you are saying?!

180
00:22:56,121 --> 00:22:59,284
I don't know anything!
I don't want to know!

181
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:02,282
I want my son!

182
00:23:13,806 --> 00:23:15,967
What will become of us
if you lose courage?

183
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,801
Now listen to me...

184
00:23:21,145 --> 00:23:25,138
You believe in God, don't you?

185
00:23:26,317 --> 00:23:27,807
What you think?

186
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,980
Vijay is my son too.
I'm worried too.

187
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:38,156
Everything will be all right.

188
00:23:38,896 --> 00:23:43,492
In half an hour we'll know
how much your father loves you.

189
00:23:45,002 --> 00:23:51,840
He won't refuse me if he
wants to see you alive.

190
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:59,513
What do you think? After all,
you are his only son.

191
00:24:01,185 --> 00:24:04,348
For your sake, will he do
what I want him to?

192
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,181
Or won't he?

193
00:24:17,201 --> 00:24:22,538
Yes. When?
I'm coming over.

194
00:24:24,876 --> 00:24:27,038
I'll be back in some time.

195
00:24:28,713 --> 00:24:31,876
In case I am late, make sure
you call Ashwini at eight.

196
00:24:31,983 --> 00:24:33,974
See what he says.

197
00:24:37,055 --> 00:24:43,221
Record the conversation.
I'll hear it when I get back.

198
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:11,082
Mr Ashwini... well,
what have you to say?

199
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,252
Will you let Yeswant go?

200
00:25:20,932 --> 00:25:28,931
Yeswant is a criminal.
I can't let him go.

201
00:25:29,607 --> 00:25:31,598
But you know...

202
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:35,275
Yes I know very well.

203
00:25:36,615 --> 00:25:39,948
I know! My son's life
is in your hands.

204
00:25:43,121 --> 00:25:48,957
Go on! Kill him!
Kill him if you will!

205
00:25:49,126 --> 00:25:54,121
But I can't betray my duty!
Understand?!

206
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:59,626
Do what you want! Hear that?!
Do whatever you want!

207
00:26:00,137 --> 00:26:02,470
But I'm not going to
let Yeswant go!

208
00:26:02,974 --> 00:26:04,635
I won't leave him!

209
00:26:18,155 --> 00:26:20,146
Did you call him?

210
00:26:20,325 --> 00:26:22,316
Yes.
- What did he have to say?

211
00:26:23,494 --> 00:26:25,486
You'd rather listen
for yourself.

212
00:26:31,002 --> 00:26:37,670
I know! My son's life
is in your hands.

213
00:26:40,511 --> 00:26:46,416
Go on! Kill him!
Kill him if you will!

214
00:26:46,518 --> 00:26:51,353
But I won't betray my duty!
Understand?!

215
00:26:52,356 --> 00:26:56,851
Do what you want! Hear that?!
Do whatever you want!

216
00:26:57,528 --> 00:26:59,690
But I'm not going to
let Yeswant go!

217
00:27:14,046 --> 00:27:16,037
Erase that tape.

218
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:19,038
Bring that boy here.

219
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,881
Come on.

220
00:27:56,421 --> 00:27:59,413
The telephone exchange...
they've traced the call.

221
00:28:00,092 --> 00:28:02,252
We know where the call
came from.

222
00:29:49,534 --> 00:29:51,525
Found him? Is he there?

223
00:29:52,203 --> 00:29:53,865
No. There's no one here.

224
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:13,384
He's a child! You couldn't
even catch a child!

225
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:20,895
Useless morons!

226
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:22,396
We tried...

227
00:30:53,597 --> 00:30:55,588
Where's my son?
- I don't know!

228
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,602
I don't know!
- Tell me... where is he?

229
00:31:00,771 --> 00:31:02,432
I have no idea!
- Have no idea, do you?

230
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,598
No!

231
00:31:07,444 --> 00:31:09,435
Where is my son?

232
00:31:10,115 --> 00:31:11,673
- I don't know!
- Lie!

233
00:31:11,782 --> 00:31:13,773
No! Don't hit me!

234
00:31:14,818 --> 00:31:16,945
Ashwini! We have
found your son.

235
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,951
I don't know!

236
00:31:22,626 --> 00:31:25,618
I'll kill you!
- We have found your son!

237
00:31:27,132 --> 00:31:29,463
We just received a wireless
message. He has reached home.

238
00:31:42,314 --> 00:31:44,305
Come along.

239
00:31:46,817 --> 00:31:48,808
Vijay! Look who's home!

240
00:32:30,528 --> 00:32:36,022
Go on! Kill him!
Kill him if you will!

241
00:32:36,134 --> 00:32:39,365
But I won't betray my duty!

242
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:45,365
He has already
gone to school.

243
00:32:46,377 --> 00:32:48,038
- Gone...?
- Yes.

244
00:32:48,212 --> 00:32:50,374
He said he was getting late.

245
00:32:50,882 --> 00:32:53,042
The school is nearby.
He said he'd take a walk.

246
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:59,884
- Take a walk?
- Must've gone with friends.

247
00:33:09,401 --> 00:33:13,064
I know! My son's life
is in your hands.

248
00:33:15,406 --> 00:33:18,898
Go on! Kill him!
Kill him if you will!

249
00:34:09,793 --> 00:34:12,956
- Let's take this train.
- Hurry!

250
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:42,992
Stop smoking pot. Some day,
you could get killed.

251
00:34:55,172 --> 00:34:57,164
No. Don't do it.

252
00:35:12,023 --> 00:35:14,355
Excuse me... can you spare
a match?

253
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:17,016
No.

254
00:35:43,554 --> 00:35:49,221
Take that foot off.
- Did you tell me something?

255
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:52,085
That foot... take it off.

256
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,561
No. Let's not do it.

257
00:37:04,969 --> 00:37:06,960
Are you all right?

258
00:37:25,489 --> 00:37:27,481
You taught them
a good lesson.

259
00:37:28,326 --> 00:37:30,317
But we should also lodge a
complaint with the police.

260
00:37:33,664 --> 00:37:35,655
What use is the police?
It won't do you any good.

261
00:37:37,501 --> 00:37:39,833
Well... it's late as it is.

262
00:37:40,672 --> 00:37:44,835
Yes. It's late.
And you are all alone.

263
00:37:47,344 --> 00:37:49,835
Won't folks at home
worry about you?

264
00:37:51,516 --> 00:37:55,849
I have no family.
I'm living alone.

265
00:37:59,356 --> 00:38:02,190
Alone?

266
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,349
Yes.

267
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,021
Travelling alone...
doesn't it scare you?

268
00:38:09,701 --> 00:38:15,536
I'm all alone. I have
nobody to feel afraid of.

269
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:19,699
In my case, I guess the one
I'm scared of is myself.

270
00:38:21,713 --> 00:38:23,704
Do you live alone too?

271
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:31,215
People who live with others
can be loners too.

272
00:38:32,724 --> 00:38:34,715
Anyway... forget it.

273
00:38:37,228 --> 00:38:39,219
Well what are you into?

274
00:38:41,065 --> 00:38:43,056
I mean... what kind of
a job do you do?

275
00:38:44,235 --> 00:38:48,898
Looking for a job
is a job in itself.

276
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,731
That's what I'm doing nowadays.

277
00:38:52,744 --> 00:38:54,735
This is where I live.

278
00:39:00,918 --> 00:39:02,909
- So...
- I mean...

279
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,911
I make good coffee.

280
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,751
Let's do it sometime else.

281
00:39:13,431 --> 00:39:15,422
Well... you've seen
where I live.

282
00:39:15,932 --> 00:39:17,923
I'll tell you where I work.

283
00:39:18,769 --> 00:39:23,764
I work in Hotel Samrat.
Do drop in sometime.

284
00:39:24,608 --> 00:39:26,440
- Hotel Samrat?
- Yes.

285
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:30,775
- Which department?
- I sing.

286
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:36,443
It's a fad of sorts nowadays
in big hotels. They prefer...

287
00:39:36,554 --> 00:39:38,784
to dish out Indian classical
music like Ghazals...

288
00:39:39,289 --> 00:39:41,280
instead of English pop.

289
00:39:43,293 --> 00:39:45,784
I'll drop by some day
to hear a song.

290
00:39:47,965 --> 00:39:50,956
And... I'm Roma.

291
00:39:52,804 --> 00:39:54,465
Vijay.

292
00:40:19,411 --> 00:40:21,572
Is he here?
- Yes. I've kept him waiting.

293
00:40:22,414 --> 00:40:23,574
Send him in.

294
00:40:27,253 --> 00:40:29,244
Good morning Mr DCP!
(Deputy Commissioner of Police)

295
00:40:29,588 --> 00:40:33,251
I hear you want to see me.
So here I am.

296
00:40:34,594 --> 00:40:36,585
How are you, sir?

297
00:40:37,764 --> 00:40:43,259
Smoking isn't allowed in
my office, Mr J K Verma.

298
00:40:44,938 --> 00:40:46,929
Please leave it outside.

299
00:40:48,273 --> 00:40:49,934
- And listen...
- Yes...?

300
00:40:50,108 --> 00:40:52,099
Knock before you come in.

301
00:41:06,291 --> 00:41:07,952
You may.

302
00:41:13,132 --> 00:41:14,621
Thank you.

303
00:41:21,641 --> 00:41:24,632
I know you are a businessman
of repute.

304
00:41:26,311 --> 00:41:29,474
You have many responsibilities.
And you run a large business.

305
00:41:30,817 --> 00:41:32,978
By calling you here I must've
put you to inconvenience.

306
00:41:33,152 --> 00:41:35,143
Not at all.

307
00:41:35,655 --> 00:41:39,489
I regard it my duty to help
the police and the law.

308
00:41:41,494 --> 00:41:45,657
A noble idea! In fact,
it's all thanks to...

309
00:41:45,764 --> 00:41:48,996
... noble souls like you, that
policemen still make a living.

310
00:41:49,168 --> 00:41:50,498
Thanks.

311
00:41:51,336 --> 00:41:53,327
Were it not for
people like you...

312
00:41:54,007 --> 00:41:57,340
... this department
would have folded up.

313
00:42:00,112 --> 00:42:03,673
I have some things to
ask you, Mr J K Verma.

314
00:42:04,016 --> 00:42:05,507
Go on.

315
00:42:06,518 --> 00:42:10,853
On April 11, one Umesh Chand
was arrested in Santa Cruz.

316
00:42:12,358 --> 00:42:14,349
He was carrying diamonds.
Concealed in a briefcase.

317
00:42:18,197 --> 00:42:20,858
On June 16, a truck was
impounded by the police.

318
00:42:21,034 --> 00:42:23,025
It was smuggling contraband.

319
00:42:23,202 --> 00:42:27,695
One Dhyan Singh was the driver.
Another, Shyamlal was with him.

320
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:30,032
Both were arrested.

321
00:42:32,378 --> 00:42:35,710
On July 4, the police
impounded a motorboat.

322
00:42:37,382 --> 00:42:40,215
The boat was laden with
hashish and marijuana.

323
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,721
One Jagdish Khanna
was arrested.

324
00:42:46,224 --> 00:42:51,561
Four men arrested.
At four different places.

325
00:42:53,065 --> 00:42:55,728
But there is a common thread.

326
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:59,402
At some point of time or the
other, every one of them...

327
00:42:59,905 --> 00:43:02,237
... has worked in one
of your companies.

328
00:43:02,942 --> 00:43:04,932
Am I responsible
for criminal acts...

329
00:43:05,077 --> 00:43:10,744
... of men who may
have been in my employ?

330
00:43:12,918 --> 00:43:16,753
That is if they have acted
out of their own volition.

331
00:43:18,257 --> 00:43:21,748
Do you mean to insinuate
that I am a smuggler?

332
00:43:23,096 --> 00:43:25,086
I would like to show
you a photograph.

333
00:43:25,197 --> 00:43:27,188
He's a well-known smuggler.
He is based in London.

334
00:43:27,266 --> 00:43:31,099
Jerry Board.
Maybe you know him.

335
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,273
I am seeing this face for
the first time in my life.

336
00:43:39,277 --> 00:43:41,268
Then you must be seeing
this photograph...

337
00:43:41,347 --> 00:43:42,938
... for the first time
in your life!

338
00:43:45,284 --> 00:43:47,275
Take a look.

339
00:43:48,454 --> 00:43:50,445
How about this?

340
00:43:56,963 --> 00:44:00,626
I am a successful businessman.

341
00:44:02,135 --> 00:44:06,298
I am invited to many parties.
And I meet many people.

342
00:44:08,141 --> 00:44:09,733
Surely you don't expect me
to recall names and faces...

343
00:44:09,809 --> 00:44:10,797
... of everyone I come across.

344
00:44:12,978 --> 00:44:14,969
Besides, what use is it
showing me these photographs?

345
00:44:16,481 --> 00:44:19,315
No court in the world will
convict me of smuggling...

346
00:44:20,485 --> 00:44:23,478
... merely on the basis of
these photographs.

347
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:28,650
In case you want to
ask me anything else...

348
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,161
... please make it quick.
My time is expensive.

349
00:44:33,331 --> 00:44:37,166
You are right.
Your time is precious.

350
00:44:38,838 --> 00:44:42,001
Time becomes precious when
it starts running out.

351
00:44:43,009 --> 00:44:45,340
You for one, have
very little time.

352
00:44:49,681 --> 00:44:51,672
If this business
does not stop...

353
00:44:52,184 --> 00:44:55,847
... you'll find yourself
behind bars in no time.

354
00:44:58,523 --> 00:45:01,186
I called you here to warn you.

355
00:45:03,528 --> 00:45:05,519
You may leave.

356
00:45:07,365 --> 00:45:08,856
Thanks.

357
00:45:12,204 --> 00:45:14,695
What is your son up to?

358
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:18,369
I don't even get
to see his face.

359
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,039
Has he found a job?

360
00:45:26,219 --> 00:45:29,710
The poor fellow is trying.
so hard. He'll find a job.

361
00:45:31,389 --> 00:45:33,880
If he tries hard enough
he'll surely find a job.

362
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:38,891
If he can't find a job...

363
00:45:38,998 --> 00:45:40,989
... why doesn't he start
a small business?

364
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,561
Why don't you ask him?
He'll confide in you.

365
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:48,233
After all, he is our only son.

366
00:45:50,242 --> 00:45:55,909
All I want is that he settles
down and does well in life.

367
00:46:02,922 --> 00:46:05,583
Yes... go on.

368
00:46:12,264 --> 00:46:17,099
No that won't be necessary.
All are equal before the law.

369
00:46:18,271 --> 00:46:20,262
Call him to the office.
I'll interrogate him there.

370
00:46:22,275 --> 00:46:24,266
No. That won't be necessary.
I've told you that already.

371
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:28,603
Yes. Summon him like you
summon everyone else.

372
00:46:31,951 --> 00:46:34,442
He may be my son.
That's personal.

373
00:46:38,123 --> 00:46:42,117
What's up?!
What's it about Vijay?

374
00:46:43,963 --> 00:46:45,954
There's a complaint
against him.

375
00:46:47,632 --> 00:46:51,467
He beat up four boys.
He hurt them badly.

376
00:46:53,306 --> 00:46:56,969
One of them have reported
the matter to the police.

377
00:46:57,309 --> 00:46:59,972
Vijay would never pick up
a fight for nothing.

378
00:47:00,313 --> 00:47:03,976
It might be a false alarm.
Else, it must be the others...

379
00:47:04,083 --> 00:47:05,641
... who are at fault.

380
00:47:05,985 --> 00:47:08,818
Vijay is at home. Why don't
you ask him right away?

381
00:47:11,324 --> 00:47:14,815
The complaint has been lodged
at the police station.

382
00:47:15,994 --> 00:47:18,987
Vijay will have to come over.
I will interrogate him there.

383
00:47:19,998 --> 00:47:21,659
This is not a domestic matter.

384
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:24,324
There are formalities to
be observed in this matter.

385
00:47:29,175 --> 00:47:33,668
Drop it Mom. You needn't give
justifications for my sake.

386
00:47:38,016 --> 00:47:40,007
That he has called me
to the police station...

387
00:47:40,353 --> 00:47:44,847
isn't because he's concerned.
He wants to ensure that...

388
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:50,523
people speak highly of his
sense of dedication to duty!

389
00:47:51,364 --> 00:47:53,355
The exemplary police officer!

390
00:47:54,867 --> 00:47:58,199
Forget it, Mom. You know what
the truth is. I know it too.

391
00:47:58,536 --> 00:48:01,369
He isn't your enemy!

392
00:48:03,708 --> 00:48:07,041
I must thank my father
for not being my enemy!

393
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:11,213
What more can a son expect?!

394
00:48:15,387 --> 00:48:19,050
Don't bother. I've just been
called to the police station.

395
00:48:20,059 --> 00:48:22,050
I'll go there and I'll tell
him what he wants to know.

396
00:48:22,894 --> 00:48:24,885
But who interrogates me?

397
00:48:25,231 --> 00:48:27,222
Well... I don't think it
makes a difference to me.

398
00:48:38,744 --> 00:48:40,735
What's his name
... Satish Rai?

399
00:48:41,414 --> 00:48:43,405
Get me the report.

400
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:46,240
Sit down.

401
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:56,925
Satish Rai is one of the four
you had beaten up on the train.

402
00:48:58,764 --> 00:49:00,755
He was hurt badly.

403
00:49:01,434 --> 00:49:03,094
Now his father is
a respectable man.

404
00:49:03,202 --> 00:49:06,432
And his father has lodged
the complaint against you.

405
00:49:07,106 --> 00:49:09,097
Have you anything to say?

406
00:49:10,943 --> 00:49:14,936
Sons of respectable fathers
should not forget that...

407
00:49:15,447 --> 00:49:18,280
Ione girls travelling by train
are respectable women too.

408
00:49:18,617 --> 00:49:22,780
But the complaint contains
no reference to any girl.

409
00:49:23,688 --> 00:49:25,280
Quite likely.

410
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:28,791
But the truth is that the
four of them were hoodlums.

411
00:49:29,128 --> 00:49:31,119
They were teasing the girl.
A perfectly respectable lady.

412
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:33,630
That's just why this
incident took place.

413
00:49:36,635 --> 00:49:38,626
Can you give us her
name and address?

414
00:49:40,139 --> 00:49:41,298
I can.

415
00:49:44,476 --> 00:49:46,809
Record his statement.
- Come with me.

416
00:49:53,318 --> 00:49:57,983
If that be true, why did you
not report it to the police?

417
00:49:59,824 --> 00:50:03,157
She wanted to. I didn't
think it was necessary.

418
00:50:04,663 --> 00:50:06,653
You didn't think
it was necessary!

419
00:50:08,166 --> 00:50:12,159
They were hoodlums.
And you didn't think...

420
00:50:12,271 --> 00:50:14,670
it was necessary to inform
the police about them!

421
00:50:16,342 --> 00:50:20,835
I don't need the police
to protect myself.

422
00:50:24,182 --> 00:50:26,173
Whether or not you
need the police...

423
00:50:27,018 --> 00:50:29,681
the police are always on
the lookout for people...

424
00:50:30,523 --> 00:50:33,514
who are likely to take
the law in their own hands.

425
00:50:35,527 --> 00:50:39,019
We'll presently find out
whether you're guilty or not.

426
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:43,864
But if you hold the law
in such contempt...

427
00:50:45,036 --> 00:50:47,197
it is quite likely that
you will find yourself...

428
00:50:48,373 --> 00:50:50,364
in trouble someday.

429
00:50:53,211 --> 00:50:55,202
Remember what I said.

430
00:50:56,882 --> 00:50:58,873
I shall remember that too.

431
00:51:00,385 --> 00:51:02,547
Mr Vijay... please come.

432
00:51:06,891 --> 00:51:08,882
May I...?

433
00:51:11,063 --> 00:51:12,393
Go on.

434
00:51:17,769 --> 00:51:19,760
He keeps preaching me
all the time!

435
00:51:21,907 --> 00:51:24,898
I know what's right
and what's wrong.

436
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:28,068
I don't need any lectures.

437
00:51:28,746 --> 00:51:34,742
You don't need anyone!
You don't even need me!

438
00:51:45,597 --> 00:51:49,762
You are the one I need, Mummy!

439
00:51:50,436 --> 00:51:52,768
Yes. I know that.

440
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:59,775
I'm going for an interview.
You'll pray for me, won't you?

441
00:52:01,447 --> 00:52:03,438
I keep praying for you.

442
00:52:30,643 --> 00:52:33,304
I understand.
But you have no experience.

443
00:52:33,478 --> 00:52:34,639
But you don't know
my capabilities.

444
00:52:34,813 --> 00:52:38,646
I agree. Your qualifications
are adequate...

445
00:52:38,751 --> 00:52:40,981
... for the position of
assistant manager.

446
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,481
But you are inexperienced.

447
00:52:43,889 --> 00:52:47,153
How can I gain the experience
unless I am given a chance?

448
00:52:47,826 --> 00:52:48,815
That may be so...

449
00:52:49,094 --> 00:52:51,653
Believe me, sir.
I can handle the job.

450
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:59,661
Give him the job.

451
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,831
You can join this hotel
from tomorrow. Let's go.

452
00:53:08,347 --> 00:53:10,338
So you've landed the job!

453
00:53:20,693 --> 00:53:22,684
Who is he?

454
00:53:23,027 --> 00:53:25,860
Mr K D Narang.
He owns this hotel.

455
00:53:42,213 --> 00:53:46,378
I only know that...

456
00:53:47,885 --> 00:53:53,380
... he is very handsome

457
00:53:57,463 --> 00:53:59,896
But I didn't have...

458
00:54:02,568 --> 00:54:07,561
... his address

459
00:54:27,092 --> 00:54:30,583
I wrote my lover a letter

460
00:54:37,769 --> 00:54:39,601
In the letter I wrote

461
00:54:39,771 --> 00:54:44,936
You are the one I love

462
00:55:08,967 --> 00:55:11,958
Unlike a leaf fallen
off a tree

463
00:55:12,137 --> 00:55:15,800
My letter was not just
a piece of paper

464
00:55:26,918 --> 00:55:33,483
It is my heart's desire
It holds my dear life

465
00:55:33,826 --> 00:55:40,822
I hope my letter
is not lost

466
00:55:44,936 --> 00:55:51,501
I entreated the postmaster
When I went to post the letter

467
00:55:51,844 --> 00:55:57,510
I told him that...

468
00:55:58,851 --> 00:56:04,016
I have written the letter
to my beloved

469
00:56:32,885 --> 00:56:40,052
I waited for years for
a reply from my beloved

470
00:56:54,739 --> 00:56:58,072
One day my letter
came back undelivered

471
00:56:58,242 --> 00:57:01,576
The postman told me

472
00:57:01,914 --> 00:57:09,081
That nowhere was found

473
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:16,083
A man of this name

474
00:57:16,795 --> 00:57:19,922
Nor a street so-called

475
00:57:20,364 --> 00:57:23,425
Nor the city I named

476
00:57:49,293 --> 00:57:52,286
You had said you'd come.
I remember that.

477
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:55,963
I thought you were
just being formal.

478
00:57:56,134 --> 00:57:58,125
I hadn't expected you
to remember.

479
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:03,472
I never forget.

480
00:58:06,644 --> 00:58:08,976
There's good news.
And I wanted you to be...

481
00:58:09,081 --> 00:58:11,072
... the first to know.
That's why I came over.

482
00:58:12,483 --> 00:58:16,648
You must've landed a job!
- How did you guess?

483
00:58:16,989 --> 00:58:18,478
Nothing could be
better news...

484
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:20,581
for someone who has been
looking for a job!

485
00:58:21,326 --> 00:58:23,317
I don't forget either!

486
00:58:29,001 --> 00:58:31,663
You know, I do make
very good coffee.

487
00:58:38,342 --> 00:58:40,003
Not tonight.

488
00:58:40,679 --> 00:58:44,672
You must be tired.
Besides, it's late.

489
00:58:46,351 --> 00:58:48,342
Some other time...

490
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:56,525
There was something
I wanted to tell you.

491
00:58:59,364 --> 00:59:01,355
You sing very well.

492
00:59:03,869 --> 00:59:05,860
I know.

493
00:59:22,054 --> 00:59:24,887
Have you been looking for me?
- Yes.

494
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:30,550
Your mother tells me that...

495
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:36,565
you have started working
in Hotel Shezaan.

496
00:59:37,402 --> 00:59:38,561
Yes.

497
00:59:38,903 --> 00:59:44,068
Strange! You should have
at least asked me!

498
00:59:45,242 --> 00:59:47,233
Do you know who
owns the hotel?

499
00:59:47,746 --> 00:59:50,579
Yes. Mr K D Narang.

500
00:59:51,083 --> 00:59:53,244
Do you know what he is?

501
00:59:55,086 --> 00:59:58,750
He is a smuggler.
A top-notch smuggler.

502
00:59:59,257 --> 01:00:02,748
He is into shady businesses.

503
01:00:04,096 --> 01:00:06,086
He is a black-listed man!

504
01:00:06,764 --> 01:00:08,755
And you are working for him!

505
01:00:10,768 --> 01:00:12,760
I am employed in his hotel.

506
01:00:13,438 --> 01:00:15,429
Surely, the hotel
isn't illegal.

507
01:00:16,108 --> 01:00:19,271
Do not try to teach me.

508
01:00:20,445 --> 01:00:23,106
I know what kinds of
shady businesses...

509
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,271
... go on in these hotels.

510
01:00:26,117 --> 01:00:28,278
You needn't take up the job.

511
01:00:32,623 --> 01:00:36,115
No business is clean.

512
01:00:38,963 --> 01:00:40,954
At this rate, I can't
take up any job!

513
01:00:42,467 --> 01:00:44,458
I'm working in that hotel.

514
01:00:44,802 --> 01:00:48,637
The owner might be a smuggler,
a bandit, or a murderer.

515
01:00:48,739 --> 01:00:50,731
Let him do what he wants.
Why should I be concerned?

516
01:00:51,476 --> 01:00:55,809
But it makes a difference
to me! What'd people say?!

517
01:00:55,914 --> 01:00:59,474
That the DCP's son is
working for a smuggler!

518
01:01:00,318 --> 01:01:02,309
And I have to listen that.

519
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:07,815
Besides, what is not right
is wrong.

520
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:10,251
Do I stay unemployed
for the rest of my life?

521
01:01:10,494 --> 01:01:18,163
Are you worthless?!
Can't you find a decent job?

522
01:01:19,503 --> 01:01:21,494
Difficult.

523
01:01:23,842 --> 01:01:30,838
Take the job you do.
It isn't quite so clean...

524
01:01:31,516 --> 01:01:33,507
Shut up!

525
01:01:34,853 --> 01:01:37,184
You don't even know the
difference between...

526
01:01:37,289 --> 01:01:39,347
an outlaw and one who
upholds the law!

527
01:01:40,192 --> 01:01:42,353
You should go see a shrink!

528
01:01:43,027 --> 01:01:47,692
What's the matter?
Why are you so excited?

529
01:01:48,266 --> 01:01:52,202
It's just as well that you are here!
Hear what your son says!

530
01:01:53,204 --> 01:01:55,695
All the smuggler has given
him is a lousy job!

531
01:01:56,208 --> 01:01:58,199
And your son is already
loyalty personified!

532
01:01:58,309 --> 01:02:00,300
He can't even bear to hear
a word against him.

533
01:02:00,878 --> 01:02:03,541
What if he bestows
a small favour on you someday?

534
01:02:03,882 --> 01:02:06,043
That smuggler will become
more important then me.

535
01:02:06,485 --> 01:02:08,476
This smuggler indeed
did me a great favour!

536
01:02:09,221 --> 01:02:11,711
He was the one who saved me!

537
01:02:12,556 --> 01:02:16,550
When my father was letting me
die for the sake of the law...

538
01:02:17,228 --> 01:02:20,221
Vijay! Mind your tongue!

539
01:02:33,077 --> 01:02:35,068
I do not regret about you...

540
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:40,240
that you have misbehaved with me.

541
01:02:41,585 --> 01:02:49,583
But I am sorry to see
how low you can stoop.

542
01:02:53,097 --> 01:02:55,259
Now listen to what I say!
- Now please don't...

543
01:02:55,432 --> 01:02:58,925
Sheetal! Don't interfere!

544
01:03:02,773 --> 01:03:10,271
If you take up that job,
you are leaving my house.

545
01:03:17,621 --> 01:03:18,952
I am leaving.

546
01:03:32,137 --> 01:03:33,297
Stop!

547
01:03:42,646 --> 01:03:45,480
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

548
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:48,141
What's that luggage about?

549
01:03:48,253 --> 01:03:51,983
- Going or coming?
- Just got out of home.

550
01:03:52,157 --> 01:03:54,148
And I don't quite know
where I am headed.

551
01:03:54,992 --> 01:03:58,655
Maybe you can help. Where
can I find a place to stay?

552
01:04:00,998 --> 01:04:02,989
- Possibly...
- Where?

553
01:04:04,335 --> 01:04:06,327
At my place.

554
01:04:06,503 --> 01:04:08,835
I mean there's a room
lying vacant at my place.

555
01:04:09,673 --> 01:04:11,664
If you want to,
you can shack up.

556
01:04:12,010 --> 01:04:14,672
Thanks a lot. But you had said
that you live alone.

557
01:04:15,179 --> 01:04:19,514
Yes. I still live alone.
Any objections?

558
01:04:21,518 --> 01:04:26,684
Not that I object.
But what would people say?

559
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:31,193
People don't even
have time to bother!

560
01:04:32,864 --> 01:04:34,855
Come along.

561
01:04:40,871 --> 01:04:42,362
Come in.

562
01:04:46,043 --> 01:04:48,034
My room is over there.

563
01:04:48,713 --> 01:04:52,045
And this is your room.

564
01:04:54,385 --> 01:04:56,376
Which leaves this hall!

565
01:04:56,487 --> 01:04:58,478
No matter how small
these matchboxes are...

566
01:04:58,722 --> 01:05:04,059
one room is surely the hall!
Some satisfaction!

567
01:05:05,396 --> 01:05:07,387
It looks like a music hall!

568
01:05:11,735 --> 01:05:13,396
Listen!

569
01:05:14,405 --> 01:05:17,568
Aren't folks at home
worried about you?

570
01:05:19,411 --> 01:05:21,742
I might get to see an
ad in the papers tomorrow.

571
01:05:23,581 --> 01:05:29,918
24 year old missing.
Male Height: 6ft 2in

572
01:05:30,088 --> 01:05:32,420
Dressed in a light tan shirt
and dark tan trousers

573
01:05:32,757 --> 01:05:35,590
Last seen in the company
of an unknown girl

574
01:05:36,094 --> 01:05:42,090
Please inform the police
Informer will be rewarded

575
01:05:43,768 --> 01:05:46,601
And I'll end up behind
the bars along with you.

576
01:05:48,106 --> 01:05:50,438
My father won't need
advertisements...

577
01:05:50,541 --> 01:05:54,945
if he wants to find me.
He is the...

578
01:05:55,045 --> 01:05:57,275
Deputy Commissioner of Police.

579
01:06:00,284 --> 01:06:02,275
But he won't look for me.
I know he won't.

580
01:06:08,126 --> 01:06:11,789
I forgot the keys.
I'll be back in a moment.

581
01:06:13,297 --> 01:06:14,958
What's the rush?

582
01:06:15,132 --> 01:06:18,625
The car keys.
I left them upstairs.

583
01:06:30,681 --> 01:06:32,478
Mr Narang!

584
01:06:34,885 --> 01:06:36,648
Are you all right?!

585
01:06:51,603 --> 01:06:53,833
Mr Narang! What happened?!

586
01:06:57,342 --> 01:07:01,335
Damn you! Aren't you ashamed?!

587
01:07:03,014 --> 01:07:05,505
Go to hell.

588
01:07:07,184 --> 01:07:11,018
I set everything up!
All you had to do was shoot!

589
01:07:11,523 --> 01:07:13,514
You can't even
shoot straight!

590
01:07:13,858 --> 01:07:16,349
We had him in the cross-hairs
when we shot.

591
01:07:17,528 --> 01:07:19,519
Had that fellow not come
in between...

592
01:07:19,864 --> 01:07:21,525
Then Narang would
not be saved.

593
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:26,032
Who the hell is this fellow?!
You keep on raving about him!

594
01:07:26,204 --> 01:07:28,195
What is he?! Superman?!

595
01:07:28,373 --> 01:07:31,364
I'll tell you who he is.

596
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:36,543
Vijay... the only son
of DCP Ashwini Kumar.

597
01:07:39,217 --> 01:07:41,208
Yes! I know him!

598
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:44,710
It's a interesting news!

599
01:07:45,222 --> 01:07:50,217
The Deputy Commissioner's son
is a smuggler's body-guard!

600
01:07:52,563 --> 01:07:59,731
I have a way to take him out.

601
01:08:00,737 --> 01:08:02,728
This news must make it
to the newspapers.

602
01:08:03,074 --> 01:08:07,737
Let people know what the
reputed DCP's son is up to!

603
01:08:07,911 --> 01:08:10,244
To what end?

604
01:08:11,248 --> 01:08:15,413
Firstly, that removes Vijay.

605
01:08:17,921 --> 01:08:21,255
Second, it will weaken Narang.

606
01:08:21,926 --> 01:08:24,087
The scoundrel! He used to
live off the scraps I fed him!

607
01:08:24,761 --> 01:08:27,423
Today, he dares to
compete with me!

608
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:34,595
Finally, the news will
serve to undermine...

609
01:08:35,773 --> 01:08:38,605
Ashwini Kumar's credibility.

610
01:08:40,444 --> 01:08:42,605
He will fall under
a cloud of suspicion.

611
01:08:44,782 --> 01:08:50,778
That's killing three birds
with a stone.

612
01:08:53,957 --> 01:08:58,952
I needn't tell you not to
speak about this incident.

613
01:09:01,298 --> 01:09:02,458
Which incident?

614
01:09:11,975 --> 01:09:17,311
You have saved my life.
Thank you once again.

615
01:09:19,650 --> 01:09:23,143
You might recall an incident.

616
01:09:24,988 --> 01:09:30,984
Some people had abducted
Inspector Ashwini Kumar's son.

617
01:09:32,663 --> 01:09:39,159
The boy was eight years old.
The boy was trying to escape.

618
01:09:40,837 --> 01:09:43,170
If you wanted, you could have
nabbed the boy.

619
01:09:45,009 --> 01:09:47,000
But you saved his life.

620
01:09:49,012 --> 01:09:51,503
I have never forgotten
your face.

621
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:55,682
I was the child.

622
01:09:57,020 --> 01:10:00,684
You! DCP Ashwini Kumar's son?!

623
01:10:01,125 --> 01:10:04,685
I am. But I don't live
with him anymore.

624
01:10:06,363 --> 01:10:12,529
Rest assured that I have
forgotten what I saw today.

625
01:10:30,887 --> 01:10:32,878
Come in.

626
01:10:34,391 --> 01:10:36,382
How did you find this place?

627
01:10:38,895 --> 01:10:41,386
One who is concerned
can find out.

628
01:10:42,567 --> 01:10:44,899
All right. Now sit down.

629
01:10:48,072 --> 01:10:49,733
Here.

630
01:10:54,912 --> 01:10:59,905
How are you?
- As if you're so worried...

631
01:11:03,253 --> 01:11:05,414
Who else lives here?

632
01:11:12,095 --> 01:11:15,587
Well I and... there's...

633
01:11:18,770 --> 01:11:22,432
The flat isn't mine.
It's hers.

634
01:11:23,774 --> 01:11:25,765
So... she's bound
to live here.

635
01:11:27,779 --> 01:11:29,770
Roma... she's Roma.

636
01:11:34,118 --> 01:11:37,451
That's her room over there.
She keeps to herself.

637
01:11:37,788 --> 01:11:40,780
That's my room over there.
It's separate.

638
01:11:42,292 --> 01:11:47,958
This is the living room
... we share it.

639
01:11:52,136 --> 01:11:53,296
Would you like a cup of tea?

640
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:58,131
I'll make the tea for you.

641
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:00,966
But you're coming home.

642
01:12:02,145 --> 01:12:06,310
Mummy! Please! Listen to me!

643
01:12:07,984 --> 01:12:10,145
- What are you doing?!
- Getting your luggage.

644
01:12:11,488 --> 01:12:14,980
This is getting complicated.
I'm not going back.

645
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:22,497
- Now let bygones be...
- You have oppressive parents!

646
01:12:22,833 --> 01:12:24,994
Now don't you give me
this nonsense!

647
01:12:25,168 --> 01:12:26,829
Just pack and get moving.

648
01:12:30,507 --> 01:12:35,502
I have nothing against you.
In fact I missed you.

649
01:12:36,514 --> 01:12:38,845
It was nice of you to come
here. I have seen you now.

650
01:12:39,516 --> 01:12:43,350
- But I'm not going back.
- Why not? Tell me.

651
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:45,851
After all, he is your father.

652
01:12:45,957 --> 01:12:47,185
Doesn't he have the right
to tell you anything?

653
01:12:47,390 --> 01:12:49,518
You won't like it
if I speak my mind.

654
01:12:50,027 --> 01:12:52,859
Don't force me to speak.
And I'm not going back.

655
01:12:55,365 --> 01:12:57,527
Very well then.
I am not leaving either.

656
01:13:04,041 --> 01:13:08,204
I'll get my things over.
If he is such a bad man...

657
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:12,042
- let him rot alone.
- Why don't you understand?

658
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:17,042
How can I understand?!
I am a fool!

659
01:13:17,889 --> 01:13:19,880
It's you and your father
who understand everything!

660
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:26,394
He doesn't bare his emotions.

661
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:32,225
But I know what he is going
through ever since you left.

662
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:37,063
He keeps calling
home from work.

663
01:13:37,908 --> 01:13:40,069
He keeps talking
about petty things.

664
01:13:40,744 --> 01:13:45,078
Don't I know what
he wants to ask?

665
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:49,412
He just wants to find out
whether you have come home.

666
01:14:06,604 --> 01:14:09,595
No more weeping.

667
01:14:11,609 --> 01:14:13,600
I'll do whatever
you want me to.

668
01:14:13,944 --> 01:14:16,606
If you want me to
come home, I will.

669
01:14:16,948 --> 01:14:19,939
What do you mean you will?
Come with me now.

670
01:14:21,452 --> 01:14:24,444
It wouldn't look nice.
I'm staying at someone's place.

671
01:14:24,555 --> 01:14:28,115
She has been kind to me.
I should atleast bid good bye.

672
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:31,451
Go on, Mummy.
I'll come over tomorrow.

673
01:14:31,962 --> 01:14:34,796
- You'll come, won't you?
- Sure. I promise.

674
01:14:36,132 --> 01:14:38,623
Now give me a smile.

675
01:14:49,646 --> 01:14:56,143
You're the only son. They'll
be happy to have you home.

676
01:14:58,655 --> 01:14:59,987
What would you feel?

677
01:15:09,833 --> 01:15:13,997
Sometimes, I feel like talking
my heart out to you.

678
01:15:18,175 --> 01:15:20,336
So long as it can
be understood...

679
01:15:21,011 --> 01:15:23,002
some things are best
left unsaid.

680
01:15:24,015 --> 01:15:30,011
I think I know what you have
in mind. The gesture is enough.

681
01:15:36,694 --> 01:15:39,185
My compliments, lady!

682
01:15:40,197 --> 01:15:43,189
You sing very well!

683
01:15:44,034 --> 01:15:46,195
May I know your name?

684
01:15:47,872 --> 01:15:50,203
What's your problem?

685
01:15:50,541 --> 01:15:53,873
No problem... but...
- What a lovely voice!

686
01:15:54,045 --> 01:15:55,706
Excuse me... please go on.

687
01:15:55,880 --> 01:16:00,543
I'm not going anywhere!
I'm here to hear her sing!

688
01:16:02,886 --> 01:16:08,552
Lovely voice! I must hear
a song tonight!

689
01:16:08,725 --> 01:16:12,560
The show is over.
You can come tomorrow.

690
01:16:12,729 --> 01:16:18,065
Do it once again!
I'm ready to pay!

691
01:16:18,402 --> 01:16:21,734
How much do you want?
How much?

692
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:25,731
What is this?!
Who are you?!

693
01:16:26,243 --> 01:16:29,234
I'm talking to her directly.

694
01:16:29,412 --> 01:16:31,744
Are you the pimp?

695
01:16:36,087 --> 01:16:40,251
Get out! Out of here?!

696
01:16:41,091 --> 01:16:46,587
Is she your mistress?!
- Bastard! I'll kill you!

697
01:16:47,097 --> 01:16:49,588
Out of my way!
I won't spare him!

698
01:16:54,438 --> 01:16:56,929
I'll kill you!

699
01:17:01,945 --> 01:17:04,106
Listen... the lady with you
looks shaken.

700
01:17:04,215 --> 01:17:06,614
Please go inside.
We'll fix him.

701
01:17:06,783 --> 01:17:10,275
- Get up.
- Get out.

702
01:17:15,525 --> 01:17:18,289
I'll wait for him right here.
I'll give him a licking!

703
01:17:18,462 --> 01:17:21,123
That will be enough.

704
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:27,793
I had a tough time in there.
He packs a good punch.

705
01:17:28,139 --> 01:17:30,630
You were supposed to intervene
right away. You took your time.

706
01:17:31,641 --> 01:17:35,305
We wanted people in there
to take a good look at you.

707
01:17:35,479 --> 01:17:41,815
Well all right. Pay me now.
My job is over.

708
01:17:42,319 --> 01:17:45,310
You've performed well in
the role of the drunk.

709
01:17:46,323 --> 01:17:49,814
- I have another role for you.
- What?

710
01:17:50,261 --> 01:17:52,661
Now you'll play a dead man.

711
01:17:53,296 --> 01:17:54,992
What do you mean?!

712
01:18:40,444 --> 01:18:41,706
What is it Inspector?

713
01:18:41,979 --> 01:18:44,538
I have an arrest warrant
for Mr Vijay.

714
01:18:46,149 --> 01:18:48,140
A warrant for arrest?!

715
01:18:52,890 --> 01:18:56,381
What charges?
- For murder of one Ganpatrai.

716
01:19:11,242 --> 01:19:12,903
But I haven't killed anyone!

717
01:19:13,077 --> 01:19:15,909
I don't even know anyone
by that name!

718
01:19:17,914 --> 01:19:19,905
I haven't killed anyone.
That's the truth.

719
01:19:20,016 --> 01:19:24,248
What is going on?

720
01:19:25,588 --> 01:19:28,921
They have an arrest warrant
for me! For murder!

721
01:19:29,426 --> 01:19:30,414
What?!

722
01:19:30,594 --> 01:19:34,086
But I haven't killed anyone!
I swear!

723
01:19:44,608 --> 01:19:46,599
Let me tell you something.

724
01:19:47,278 --> 01:19:50,770
No matter what, he can
never kill anyone!

725
01:19:51,782 --> 01:19:54,944
The police are making
a mistake!

726
01:19:55,452 --> 01:19:57,613
The question of a mistake
does not arise.

727
01:19:58,622 --> 01:20:01,613
Mr Vijay was in Hotel Samrat
around 11 last night.

728
01:20:02,292 --> 01:20:04,625
He was in the company
of one Ms Roma.

729
01:20:05,628 --> 01:20:08,291
There he quarrelled
with the deceased.

730
01:20:08,631 --> 01:20:12,466
Yes.
- He beat the deceased up badly.

731
01:20:13,136 --> 01:20:16,470
Vijay even threatened
to kill him in public.

732
01:20:16,974 --> 01:20:18,965
I was in a rage.
I can't even recall it clearly.

733
01:20:19,076 --> 01:20:22,136
When the deceased left,
Vijay chased him.

734
01:20:22,512 --> 01:20:25,481
Does it mean that I killed
him? I was back in a minute!

735
01:20:25,849 --> 01:20:28,646
The deceased was found
moments after you left.

736
01:20:28,985 --> 01:20:31,146
He was dead on the pavement
across the street.

737
01:20:40,831 --> 01:20:44,493
I'm saying the truth!

738
01:20:47,671 --> 01:20:52,164
You might be saying the truth.

739
01:20:53,510 --> 01:20:59,345
But I cannot help you
in these circumstances.

740
01:21:05,355 --> 01:21:07,346
What are you saying?!

741
01:21:09,025 --> 01:21:12,689
Vijay is innocent!
I'm telling you!

742
01:21:14,364 --> 01:21:19,199
I know that!
He wouldn't lie to me!

743
01:21:20,037 --> 01:21:24,029
Please tell them!
They will listen to you!

744
01:21:24,375 --> 01:21:29,038
Tell them! Tell them that
Vijay is innocent!

745
01:21:29,145 --> 01:21:32,206
Enough Mummy! You needn't
beg of anyone for my sake!

746
01:21:32,315 --> 01:21:34,716
I must! I have to!

747
01:21:36,052 --> 01:21:39,386
My son isn't a killer!
He isn't a criminal!

748
01:21:40,056 --> 01:21:43,390
Tell them that! They can't
do such a thing!

749
01:21:45,729 --> 01:21:47,890
If your son is innocent
he will be exonerated.

750
01:21:47,997 --> 01:21:51,797
Don't worry. But try
to understand.

751
01:21:51,902 --> 01:21:53,893
An arrest warrant has been
issued against him.

752
01:21:55,905 --> 01:21:58,568
Take him away.

753
01:21:58,942 --> 01:22:03,572
No! Don't say that! He isn't
going! I won't let him!

754
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:05,739
Stop it, Mummy!

755
01:22:06,082 --> 01:22:08,414
Never mind if I hang!

756
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:11,752
But I won't have you
grovelling for my sake.

757
01:22:16,592 --> 01:22:18,253
Come.

758
01:22:43,619 --> 01:22:48,283
Why did you refuse to give
a statement to the police?

759
01:22:50,293 --> 01:22:52,284
Would you or the police...

760
01:22:52,395 --> 01:22:54,454
accept my innocence
if I did?

761
01:22:55,466 --> 01:23:03,463
It isn't for the police
to give the verdict.

762
01:23:04,807 --> 01:23:06,798
The court will decide.

763
01:23:07,310 --> 01:23:09,471
In that case, I will make
my statement in court.

764
01:23:18,654 --> 01:23:24,490
If you are innocent, it is
your duty to help the police.

765
01:23:25,162 --> 01:23:27,153
I have always been innocent.

766
01:23:29,332 --> 01:23:32,824
But you have never
considered it your duty to help me.

767
01:23:38,675 --> 01:23:43,668
I do not stand before you
as your father.

768
01:23:45,515 --> 01:23:48,006
I am a policeman.
Don't forget that.

769
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:52,011
That is nothing new to me.

770
01:23:55,859 --> 01:24:01,024
You have always spoken to me
as a policeman would.

771
01:24:05,536 --> 01:24:07,025
Vijay...

772
01:24:08,204 --> 01:24:15,872
You may have complaints
against me.

773
01:24:17,547 --> 01:24:24,545
But here and now, you must
forget that you are my son.

774
01:24:29,225 --> 01:24:32,217
You are right.
I should forget it.

775
01:24:36,233 --> 01:24:38,224
Someone has come for
Mr Vijay Kumar's bail.

776
01:24:47,176 --> 01:24:50,408
Go through the papers.
The court has ordered that...
