1
00:00:49,684 --> 00:00:53,313
You've come here in this storm?

2
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:57,019
I've been watching you for 17 years.

3
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:01,459
Every morning you come here
to offer milk to Lord Shiva.

4
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:05,356
Whether heat or cold,
hail or storm.

5
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,395
There must be something.

6
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:13,067
There has to be a story hidden
behind your mute worship.

7
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:17,503
Story? Ask him.

8
00:01:18,713 --> 00:01:19,680
...who has written it.

9
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:22,515
But I want to hear it from you.

10
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:25,310
This story is incomplete.

11
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:30,691
When it is completed,
I'll definitely tell you.

12
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:39,461
It's raining heavily.
Why don't you wait for awhile?

13
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:45,071
Shut the windows.
Or the water will seep in.

14
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:30,410
The nursemaid is here.
Everything will be fine.

15
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:34,411
- Obeisance grandfather.
- Live long Ram. Sit here.

16
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:39,049
Will my little brother come today?

17
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,658
Yes, your little brother,
Lakhan, will come today.

18
00:02:44,132 --> 00:02:47,158
The sun has risen but
Pratap hasn't returned.

19
00:02:47,702 --> 00:02:49,670
Even I am worried about him.

20
00:02:50,805 --> 00:02:52,466
The poor guy must be worried.

21
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,635
I'll be destroyed, ruined!

22
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:58,701
The court has sentenced Bhanu and
Bishambar to 4 years imprisonment.

23
00:02:59,147 --> 00:03:01,342
But who will pay their debts?

24
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:06,311
- You'll have to clear it.
- No, I've never taken loans.

25
00:03:06,721 --> 00:03:12,489
By law, if one partner is imprisoned,
the other repays his debts.

26
00:03:13,094 --> 00:03:15,289
The loans were taken
in the name of your company.

27
00:03:23,738 --> 00:03:26,536
Scoundrels! What was our fault?

28
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:30,440
That we gave you refuge in our
house because you're my cousins?

29
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,368
Made you partner in the business?

30
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,208
Was that my fault? Answer me!

31
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:39,750
You kept gambling and smuggling!

32
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,452
Took loans in the company name!

33
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:45,352
You should have been
sentenced to a dog's death!

34
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:49,888
Quiet down. Or you too
will be caught by the law!

35
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:56,336
They have committed a sin
by betraying our trust.

36
00:03:57,305 --> 00:03:59,569
That is why they are being punished.

37
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,441
We will bear the punishment.

38
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:07,777
You've committed a grave sin by
making them partners in our business.

39
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:10,450
How will we repay all the loans?

40
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,612
Who will rescue this house
from being mortgaged?

41
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,725
Grandfather, my Lakhan has come!

42
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:27,362
Lawyer uncle, my Lakhan has come!

43
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:34,163
Show me my little brother!

44
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,843
Mother, see my little brother!

45
00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:45,482
My two precious jewels.
One is Ram, the other Lakhan!

46
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,551
How did you let them in this house?

47
00:05:59,894 --> 00:06:04,160
Despite knowing what difficulty and
shame we're borne, due to them!

48
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:07,294
I know my son. I know all.

49
00:06:08,002 --> 00:06:12,769
But you must also not forget
they are my late brother's sons.

50
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:17,169
They have endured prison.
They must have changed.

51
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,305
They are demons not humans!

52
00:06:20,348 --> 00:06:25,479
Whatever it be. I've given them
permission to stay here for a month.

53
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:29,479
- Sister-in-law!
- Sister-in-law!

54
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:32,181
What are you doing?

55
00:06:32,293 --> 00:06:34,420
You're a goddess! Uncle allowed
us to stay here because of you!

56
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:38,863
How can we repay your obligation?

57
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:42,300
You are elder to me.
Brothers in this house.

58
00:06:43,204 --> 00:06:46,332
Go upstairs. Your wife
and son are waiting for you.

59
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:50,303
Look, I've waited for 4 years!

60
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,774
Now my parents won't
keep me at home longer!

61
00:06:54,048 --> 00:06:58,712
Why do you worry? We've arranged
to stay here for another month.

62
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:05,649
- But after that?
- This house will be ours!

63
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:06,720
Really?

64
00:07:07,128 --> 00:07:10,063
Pratap is my son. All my property...

65
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:13,726
Including the fields, house, godown.

66
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:19,037
Pratap and his sons Ram, Lakhan
will inherit everything.

67
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:26,577
But it is my desire that
out of the 105 acres land I own...

68
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:32,384
25 acres should be given to
Bishambar and Bhanu.

69
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:35,754
- Play with us.
- I will.

70
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:39,581
I've written down
everything in your will.

71
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:41,052
Here, sign it.

72
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:45,630
You wrote this in English.

73
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:49,159
- I can't read it.
- But you can sign in any language.

74
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:51,897
- I'll read it if you don't trust...
- No son.

75
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:55,403
No need for that. What you've
written must be right.

76
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:58,937
I want you to trust in me completely.

77
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:04,616
Don't talk like this.
You are Sharma's son.

78
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:12,456
He wasn't just our lawyer
but almost a family member.

79
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:24,365
You forgot these sweets.

80
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:31,906
No!

81
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:49,224
This is a lie! Deception, conspiracy!

82
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:53,624
I won't let your plan succeed!

83
00:08:54,168 --> 00:08:59,105
This is no plan. Here is the
will written by your father.

84
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,974
- Signed.
- What's the matter?

85
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:08,475
Did you hear? They are
showing me a will written by Dad!

86
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:11,550
According to which all this
property, this house...

87
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:15,012
...goes to Bishambar and you and
I get that ramshackle cottage.

88
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:23,089
And 5 acres of land!

89
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:25,497
You tell me if this is true.

90
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,130
Yes. He himself called me
and asked me to write this.

91
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:36,075
Do you mean Dad wished to
throw his own son on the road?

92
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:40,271
I won't believe it even if
God himself comes and tells me!

93
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:44,511
You have to accept
what's in the will.

94
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:48,082
You have to leave this house.

95
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:32,792
We must celebrate Debu's
birthday next week.

96
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:35,064
It will be celebrated!

97
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:38,033
And with great pomp!

98
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:04,958
Mother, I'm very hungry.

99
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,794
It's English.

100
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:13,232
Should I get milk for
brother from there?

101
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:14,997
No.

102
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:21,342
I'm going to get milk.

103
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:25,678
My stomach is paining.

104
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:30,249
Wait, I'll come with you.

105
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:32,520
I'll be back soon.

106
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,727
Have fun!

107
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:42,031
Sister-in-law!

108
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,303
See what this is.

109
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:52,775
- These ornaments lying...
- Shall I take some?

110
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,741
They aren't ours.
I'll keep it there.

111
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:03,315
Good grief! You in my room?

112
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:06,789
These are my ornaments!

113
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:12,488
Did you hear? She's robbing you
in bright daylight!

114
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:16,663
- Listen to me.
- Why are you yelling? What's it?

115
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:21,037
What is to happen? She was
running away with my ornaments.

116
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,375
...That I caught her.
- No.

117
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,007
I was putting them away safely.

118
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:30,982
That's what you'll say
now that you're caught!

119
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:35,453
You are telling lies.
My mother didn't steal.

120
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:38,648
There speaks the son of a thief!

121
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:42,787
Hold her while I call the police!

122
00:12:43,664 --> 00:12:48,692
Have you all gone mad?
Would I steal?

123
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:54,901
In a condition like yours women
sell themselves not just steal!

124
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:00,774
May you be ruined!

125
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:08,344
First she tells lies.
Then she abuses my mother!

126
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,416
- Hitting a woman!
- Hitting a child!

127
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:15,155
Listen to this rascal!

128
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:21,662
- Give this to me. Get out!
- No! Let go!

129
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,665
Bitch went into my wife's room
and was stealing her ornaments!

130
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:03,106
Don't you dare step
in this house again!

131
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,338
Understood, you witch!

132
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:14,016
How dare you! Bastard!

133
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:16,651
You hit my wife! Let go of me!

134
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:20,951
Rascal! Scoundrel!
Fight with a man!

135
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:24,555
If I don't rip you to pieces,
I'm not worthy of my name!

136
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:27,992
No, don't do this!

137
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:32,164
For my sake, let's go home.

138
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:37,037
It was my mistake that I went there.

139
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:41,113
Ram is very unwell. Come home.

140
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:45,841
I don't want there to be
bloodshed in this house.

141
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:50,421
For the sake of our children,
let's go home!

142
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:55,591
I'll show you the result
of what you accused us of!

143
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,021
You threw Dad's daughter-in-law
out of the house! Remember that!

144
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:05,866
Both of you keep in mind
I will avenge this!

145
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:23,383
It's scotch. Gulp it down.

146
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:26,284
Rascal!

147
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:34,833
The one who used to sell country
liquor now sells scotch!

148
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:39,035
He has bought a few trucks.

149
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:47,276
One gets so much fare in
ferrying liquor and drugs...

150
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:53,414
...that you claim the value
of the truck in just 6 months!

151
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:59,786
Why don't we sell the fields
and buy 25 trucks?

152
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:02,687
No, this property is Pratap's.

153
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:06,893
God will never forgive my sins.

154
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:13,104
I'll tell everyone tomorrow that
I made a wrong will by mistake.

155
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,803
I got him to sign it in Hindi.

156
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:22,311
He failed.

157
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,510
So we'll pass him.

158
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:42,098
Scoundrel! I'll just get the police!

159
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:05,656
He has failed.

160
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,095
Now he has passed.

161
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,260
Come on bad men!

162
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,187
No!

163
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:15,923
What kind of anger is this that
for property you kill the lawyer...

164
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:18,957
- And commit suicide thereafter!
- Suicide?

165
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,562
What else, he has committed suicide!

166
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:25,003
The poor man had gone mad.

167
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:41,917
What are you doing?

168
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:45,123
I'm collecting the
mortal remains of your Dad.

169
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:47,620
- Why?
- According to Hindu religion...

170
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:51,824
A man's remains are offered in
the Ganges after he is no more.

171
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:55,597
Only then will his soul attain peace.

172
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:03,133
Sister, these are Pratap's remains.

173
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:12,712
These can only be immersed in
the Ganges by Ram and Lakhan.

174
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,348
I know.

175
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:49,878
I won't immerse my husband's
mortal remains in the Ganges.

176
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:57,285
I will make these remains a
live Thakur Pratap Singh.

177
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,554
And keep him with me.

178
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:02,025
Like a secret.

179
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:06,921
I'll come to you everyday
wherever you are.

180
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:09,962
I'll wait for your justice.

181
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:12,705
Justice! Justice!

182
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:14,964
This is my pledge!

183
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:38,260
Where are we going?

184
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:41,395
We're going to our
clerk's uncle's house.

185
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,834
But don't go there and steal.

186
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:48,031
Your father is a thief!

187
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,535
Leave him!

188
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:53,706
Leave me. I'll show him!

189
00:21:58,084 --> 00:22:02,384
Thank god the children didn't
see their Dad's terrible death!

190
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:07,358
Otherwise who knows what they
would do when they grew up.

191
00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:12,358
But how did he die suddenly?

192
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:15,829
Don't ask how he died.

193
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:20,605
Ask how we have to live.

194
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:26,609
How do we turn Ram Lakhan
into Ram and Laxman.

195
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:50,099
You'll get a thrashing from me!

196
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:55,434
- Mother, he's beating me.
- He's refusing to go to school.

197
00:22:55,975 --> 00:23:00,742
I just exercised.
My arms are hurting here.

198
00:23:01,348 --> 00:23:05,011
You must go to school.
The teacher must be waiting.

199
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:07,943
He knows nothing.
Just keeps doing this.

200
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:10,347
Dear kids.

201
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:13,488
Why have you locked this?
What does it contain?

202
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,617
Nothing!

203
00:23:17,197 --> 00:23:19,427
It has your father's things.

204
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:23,325
And my matrimonial chain.
Never open this.

205
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,335
Go to school.

206
00:23:31,311 --> 00:23:35,441
- Here's a kilogram of sugar.
- Here's a kilogram of sugar.

207
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:41,142
Feels lighter than a kilogram.

208
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:45,853
Lightweight! If your hands are
so light, the sugar will feel light!

209
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:48,126
See this weight for yourself.

210
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:51,019
And if you still don't believe me,
check the government seal.

211
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:52,389
Check it.

212
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:01,335
What are you doing here? Scoot.

213
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,266
- What have you stuck here?
- Keep quiet.

214
00:24:04,644 --> 00:24:07,112
- I'll tell everyone.
- Run off now!

215
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:12,307
I'll tell everyone that
uncle is cheating!

216
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:14,481
Come here.

217
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:20,089
This boy is a complete
loss in my horoscope.

218
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:47,162
It's afternoon.
And you're still here?

219
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:50,906
I stayed back because of the storm.

220
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:54,611
I was thinking of old times.

221
00:26:55,081 --> 00:27:00,041
Forget the past. Your penance
has borne fruit, hasn't it?

222
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,857
Yes. Some path has been decided.

223
00:27:05,358 --> 00:27:06,382
Let me tell you one thing.

224
00:27:06,426 --> 00:27:10,453
The path of Ram is full of danger.

225
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:12,658
I see enemies all around.

226
00:27:15,435 --> 00:27:20,668
I've sent my Ram to
face those enemies!

227
00:27:21,274 --> 00:27:22,901
Every car and truck
must be checked.

228
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,438
Who dares to stop B B Trucks?

229
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:38,250
Please stop the car.

230
00:27:39,192 --> 00:27:41,422
- We have to search the car.
- What nonsense!

231
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:46,461
You haven't recognized him.
He's a well-known man in this city.

232
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:48,028
But we have our orders.

233
00:27:48,468 --> 00:27:53,030
For 15 years, nobody dared to
search our trucks or our car!

234
00:27:53,373 --> 00:27:57,309
We own 4000 trucks that ply
all over the country today.

235
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:00,401
- I know that.
- Doesn't matter.

236
00:28:01,481 --> 00:28:02,675
Where is the commissioner?

237
00:28:03,116 --> 00:28:04,913
- He's a good friend.
- Very good friend.

238
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:12,351
Tell them there are no friends or
relatives in the police force.

239
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:14,291
Son Ram!

240
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:19,888
Get them off the car
and search it thoroughly.

241
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:23,764
And if we refuse to get off?

242
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,001
Then the police will do its' job.

243
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:29,908
Will they push us out?
Or remove our clothes? What?

244
00:28:30,243 --> 00:28:32,302
Keep quiet.

245
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:41,850
- What's the matter?
- You're in time.

246
00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:45,646
- Tell him something.
- Let him search the vehicle.

247
00:28:45,992 --> 00:28:47,857
This officer of mine
is very stubborn.

248
00:28:48,261 --> 00:28:50,627
If he had his way,
he'd even search my vehicle!

249
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,854
We are decent people.

250
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:57,200
Then why should you object
to being searched?

251
00:28:57,837 --> 00:29:02,069
The truth is in this area,
Sir John and Kesariya Vilayati...

252
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:05,934
...openly carry on smuggling.
So Ram and I pledged...

253
00:29:06,312 --> 00:29:08,746
We'll give them good!

254
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:17,913
That pup of a dog!

255
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:20,852
He has started growling
in my presence!

256
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,026
I am your well wisher.

257
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:29,561
I feel for a couple of months
you should have no deals...

258
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:34,373
...with people like Sir John.

259
00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:36,402
Should we suffer losses of crores?

260
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:39,375
It's better than going to prison.

261
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,870
Who will send us to prison?
That nincompoop?

262
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,141
Ram will take revenge
because of old times.

263
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:49,550
Let him! I'll set him right!

264
00:29:51,224 --> 00:29:53,954
Kesariya Vilayati and
his boss Sir John.

265
00:29:54,594 --> 00:29:57,757
Once he is caught,
everyone will be caught!

266
00:29:58,898 --> 00:30:01,423
- Brother!
- Now what is wrong?

267
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:05,928
Sir John's partner.

268
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:13,912
Bishambar here.

269
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:17,013
Biliya here.

270
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:22,945
Sir John wants to know why our goods
haven't reached their destination.

271
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:29,125
We've worked with you for years.
Has such a delay ever taken place?

272
00:30:30,263 --> 00:30:32,128
This time we're facing
some problems.

273
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:37,694
Erase the problems.
You know Sir John

274
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:43,934
He considers anyone giving him
losses as his enemy.

275
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:49,277
Do something about Ram Pratap!

276
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:52,981
Sir John will chop off our head!

277
00:30:53,486 --> 00:30:55,545
- Don't think of it.
- What else do I think?

278
00:30:55,855 --> 00:31:00,849
Listen to me and do as I say.

279
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,989
Everything will work out fine.

280
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:04,353
Should we fight?

281
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:10,833
Don't you know how to
please a woman?

282
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:18,108
Brother of mine, come here.

283
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:23,004
Over a period man
realizes his mistake.

284
00:31:23,683 --> 00:31:26,447
There is blood relation between
Bishambar, Bhanu and Ram Lakhan.

285
00:31:26,986 --> 00:31:29,887
There may have been enmity
in this relationship.

286
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:32,453
But in the end it turns to love.

287
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,251
That is why my sister
and her husband...

288
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:40,930
...have hesitatingly sent
these saris as gifts for you.

289
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:46,335
Even they are terribly happy
to see Ram progressing.

290
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:48,200
After all they are his uncles.

291
00:31:50,209 --> 00:31:50,971
Keep them here.

292
00:31:54,313 --> 00:31:55,405
- You may go.
- Look...

293
00:31:56,315 --> 00:31:59,978
By meeting each other, the
misunderstandings will be cleared.

294
00:32:00,553 --> 00:32:02,521
Debu is to shortly
return from America.

295
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:05,186
- May I leave? - Yes.

296
00:32:22,074 --> 00:32:25,066
She didn't even ask
your brother for tea!

297
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,944
- Not even water.
- But she kept the saris.

298
00:32:29,415 --> 00:32:32,509
- Let's see the effect.
- What effect will it have?

299
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:35,652
Brother!

300
00:33:07,386 --> 00:33:08,375
Stop right there.

301
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,355
Listen to me carefully.

302
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:23,766
My husband...

303
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:26,828
...lives for me even today.

304
00:33:27,773 --> 00:33:31,903
I still have the pot
containing his mortal remains.

305
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:38,178
I haven't immersed them
in the Ganges as yet.

306
00:33:40,286 --> 00:33:44,382
The splatter of blood
on my scarf...

307
00:33:44,991 --> 00:33:47,357
I still haven't removed the stains.

308
00:33:51,731 --> 00:33:53,926
So you've come to threaten us?

309
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,359
No. To explain.

310
00:33:57,737 --> 00:34:01,264
To explain that the relations
you have already killed...

311
00:34:01,941 --> 00:34:06,105
Don't try to give them life
by the clatter of your wealth.

312
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:11,745
Don't try to add fuel to the
fire flaming within a widow.

313
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:16,852
Ram and Lakhan are the two
weapons of a wounded woman.

314
00:34:17,456 --> 00:34:19,515
Stay away from them.

315
00:34:19,992 --> 00:34:24,258
Or you'll meet the same fate
as the King of Lanka, Ravana!

316
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:29,194
Because his killers too
were named Ram-Lakhan!

317
00:34:46,018 --> 00:34:48,953
The serpent has started
displaying her fangs.

318
00:35:03,302 --> 00:35:07,204
What's the matter?
You sit in this temple for hours.

319
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:12,600
Nothing at all.
I just feel better.

320
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:18,508
What's in this box that you
never open nor let us touch?

321
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,678
I told you, things
belonging to your Dad.

322
00:35:23,923 --> 00:35:27,017
My matrimonial necklace,
symbols of my marriage.

323
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:29,251
What do you keep thinking?

324
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:33,322
- Do you ever think of
what I think? - About what?

325
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:38,361
- Lakhan who hasn't yet got a job.
- Everything will be all right.

326
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:44,339
Today is Shivratri. I had to go
to the temple but he vanished.

327
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:48,477
Must be with his friends.
Doing 1 +2=4, 4-2= 1.

328
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:53,880
- What does that mean?
- It means cheating.

329
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:55,284
Why do you say that?

330
00:35:56,922 --> 00:36:00,756
You will see someday my Lakhan
will prove to be Ram!

331
00:36:01,494 --> 00:36:04,258
I too want my brother
to be greater than me.

332
00:36:06,132 --> 00:36:07,793
- But...
- But what?

333
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:23,033
- Yes mother? - I met Geeta.
- What did she say?

334
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:26,498
She's looking for a job for Lakhan.

335
00:43:27,306 --> 00:43:29,934
- He can never get a job.
- Why?

336
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:34,170
The man who wants to become a
millionaire overnight...

337
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,375
...is not interested in any job.

338
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:39,446
That's because he's the
son of a millionaire.

339
00:43:41,753 --> 00:43:44,881
Your heart is like an
umbrella over all his antics.

340
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:56,758
Did you give him some money?

341
00:43:57,436 --> 00:43:59,927
I have no money to give him.

342
00:44:07,112 --> 00:44:11,014
Mister Fraud, get up.
It's morning.

343
00:44:12,618 --> 00:44:15,951
- Good morning brother.
- Touching one's feet means...

344
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:18,455
...obeying elders.

345
00:44:19,224 --> 00:44:20,748
Following their ideals.

346
00:44:21,493 --> 00:44:24,155
Don't start this Ramayana
early in the morning!

347
00:44:24,763 --> 00:44:26,060
Are you annoyed with God?

348
00:44:27,132 --> 00:44:33,002
Not angry but today is
the time of Ravana not Ram!

349
00:44:33,705 --> 00:44:38,074
- Like?
- Like Bishambar and Bhanu!

350
00:44:39,244 --> 00:44:42,304
Where are they and
where the hell are we!

351
00:44:43,448 --> 00:44:44,779
It's a matter of time son.

352
00:44:46,952 --> 00:44:50,183
Our time will also come.
Where can it go?

353
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:53,119
- Do you know what people say?
- What?

354
00:44:54,026 --> 00:44:58,395
If I was the police officer
instead of you and...

355
00:44:58,864 --> 00:45:01,560
...this treasure chest of a
police station was in my hands...

356
00:45:02,801 --> 00:45:08,171
Then the vault keys of men like
Bishambar would be in my hands!

357
00:45:10,342 --> 00:45:14,938
Did you see the DSP's bungalow?
Did you?

358
00:45:15,247 --> 00:45:20,275
- What a house! - Did you see
the handcuffs being made for him?

359
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:24,380
That we'll see when he wears them
But his bungalow got made!

360
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:28,016
So you're planning
on building a bungalow?

361
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:34,130
Bungalows are not in our stars.
I don't even have a job!

362
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:37,961
If you don't have a job,
how do you have 600 bucks?

363
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:41,270
I found them in your purse.

364
00:45:42,841 --> 00:45:47,335
These? This is the donation
for yesterday's song and dance.

365
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:50,408
Swear by your brother and say
that this money is donation.

366
00:45:51,283 --> 00:45:54,741
I've often told you not to
put me in such dilemmas!

367
00:45:55,787 --> 00:45:57,846
The truth is this is no donation.

368
00:45:58,824 --> 00:46:01,725
- Then where did you get it?
- Somebody gave it. - Who?

369
00:46:02,094 --> 00:46:03,459
The owner of Jeeva Transport.

370
00:46:04,129 --> 00:46:05,255
- Shall I tell mother?
- No.

371
00:46:05,664 --> 00:46:07,996
- Shall I slap you?
- Yes.

372
00:46:11,002 --> 00:46:12,902
For the last time get this clear...

373
00:46:13,405 --> 00:46:17,603
If you try to spoil
my innocent brother...

374
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:20,371
I'll spoil your life!

375
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:24,013
Here are your 600 bucks!

376
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:31,177
So there's no chance of
my becoming a millionaire.

377
00:46:32,224 --> 00:46:36,354
Neither will you become rich
nor will you marry Radha.

378
00:46:36,828 --> 00:46:38,693
But the poor thing loves him.

379
00:46:39,798 --> 00:46:41,823
- You are here?
- What's wrong?

380
00:46:42,334 --> 00:46:44,859
- Did you give my letter to her?
- I couldn't.

381
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:48,706
Her father has locked her in.

382
00:46:49,107 --> 00:46:50,369
The poor thing was crying hard.

383
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:53,935
Give me my magician's bag.

384
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:57,681
- What will you do with this?
- What will I do?

385
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,763
He has come.

386
00:47:19,638 --> 00:47:24,302
Why do you start chanting prayers
the moment you see Lakhan?

387
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:29,279
Face turns red, chest blue and
hands yellow! What's the matter?

388
00:47:29,881 --> 00:47:30,540
Do your work!

389
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:36,148
I'm holding this since morning.

390
00:47:36,454 --> 00:47:39,184
No customer came this way.
Only Lakhan has come.

391
00:47:46,264 --> 00:47:47,822
He is praying.

392
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:53,193
- At this hour? - He starts
praying the moment he sees you!

393
00:47:59,911 --> 00:48:04,109
Radha isn't at home. Go away.

394
00:48:05,116 --> 00:48:07,380
I haven't come to see her.

395
00:48:08,186 --> 00:48:11,519
I want to buy vegetarian eggs.

396
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:18,523
Eggs? You know it's a sin to even
talk of eggs, fish and meat out here!

397
00:48:19,297 --> 00:48:21,629
Vegetarian eggs? What are they?

398
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:23,395
- Shall I show you?
- Yes.

399
00:48:24,936 --> 00:48:25,868
Like this.

400
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:29,029
Keep them away!

401
00:48:30,342 --> 00:48:32,970
You are a stigma on the name of
Lord Rama and the Hindu culture!

402
00:48:40,652 --> 00:48:45,817
Stupid girl! How many times have
I told you to keep the window shut?

403
00:48:46,524 --> 00:48:49,891
When I'm soft, I'm very soft.
But when I'm angry I spout fire!

404
00:48:54,733 --> 00:48:56,997
Sir! Sir!

405
00:49:04,242 --> 00:49:08,542
I kept telling you, 'Sir! Sir! '

406
00:49:09,214 --> 00:49:15,710
Stupid oaf! Couldn't you have said
' Egg! Egg! ' instead of 'Sir! Sir! '

407
00:49:16,054 --> 00:49:18,386
You just said it's a sin
to even mention its' name!

408
00:49:20,859 --> 00:49:24,693
- What's the matter?
- He is sitting on eggs.

409
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:27,998
Sitting on eggs? Is he a hen?

410
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:35,706
Is the egg outside?

411
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:44,380
I mean get up and see
the condition of the eggs.

412
00:49:46,251 --> 00:49:49,118
What condition?
The egg must have broken.

413
00:49:50,121 --> 00:49:52,089
Go and wash it off.

414
00:49:53,158 --> 00:49:55,922
- Go and have a bath.
- Yes sir.

415
00:49:56,628 --> 00:49:59,961
Hope the eggs haven't
hatched under you.

416
00:50:00,332 --> 00:50:04,632
People will make up all kinds
of stories about you.

417
00:50:04,936 --> 00:50:07,905
Just check if there is
any egg on my backside.

418
00:50:08,273 --> 00:50:11,709
No sir but there is
a yellow colored flag.

419
00:50:14,646 --> 00:50:16,910
You have violated my sanctity!

420
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:20,551
I will sort you out! I will!

421
00:50:21,419 --> 00:50:23,683
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

422
00:50:24,289 --> 00:50:25,950
Why are you creating a scene?
This happens sometimes.

423
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:29,049
Man eats in excess sometimes.

424
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:32,494
- He gets a stomach upset.
- And he does it in his clothes!

425
00:50:33,131 --> 00:50:35,065
What are you watching? Go home.

426
00:50:36,401 --> 00:50:39,302
I'll look after the shop.
You go home and have a wash.

427
00:50:41,006 --> 00:50:43,770
Why don't you go home?
He will now go upstairs.

428
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:47,437
Wear new clothes. Everybody
does it including yourselves.

429
00:50:49,981 --> 00:50:51,539
Vegetarian eggs.

430
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:55,242
What's the matter? You entered
and started bathing with cold water?

431
00:50:55,453 --> 00:50:57,114
Let me at least warm up water.

432
00:50:57,622 --> 00:51:01,149
To hell with the water! I'm in
trouble! Get my clothes, fast!

433
00:51:01,493 --> 00:51:02,255
I'm bringing it.

434
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,730
- Go away or Dad will beat me!
- I haven't come to go away.

435
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:13,694
I've come here to stay.

436
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:19,503
Go away or father will thrash me!

437
00:51:20,912 --> 00:51:21,776
Don't you love me?

438
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:27,779
See what I've bought for you.

439
00:51:28,553 --> 00:51:31,522
- Bangles!
- I'll slip them on your wrists.

440
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:33,557
- Are they nice?
- Very nice.

441
00:51:40,331 --> 00:51:41,320
Do you know...

442
00:51:42,567 --> 00:51:44,398
...that day when
I came to meet you...

443
00:51:45,437 --> 00:51:47,598
My father thrashed me.

444
00:51:50,975 --> 00:51:53,739
Someday I'll hang
your Dad upside down!

445
00:51:54,446 --> 00:51:59,543
Don't ever do that or
he won't let us get married!

446
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:02,752
How will he stop us?

447
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:06,185
His father can't stop us!

448
00:52:08,526 --> 00:52:11,757
Towel! Keep the towel ready!

449
00:52:13,331 --> 00:52:15,492
Should I show your Dad some magic?

450
00:52:16,201 --> 00:52:19,796
Now he's crying.
Suddenly he'll start laughing.

451
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:22,768
- How?
- Like this.

452
00:52:27,779 --> 00:52:32,546
I won't spare him!
I'll send him to prison!

453
00:52:45,396 --> 00:52:46,658
Dad started laughing!

454
00:52:47,332 --> 00:52:51,496
You're such a cute boy!
You're as naughty as ever!

455
00:52:52,437 --> 00:52:56,635
- Magic! - When will you
stop these cute antics?

456
00:52:57,375 --> 00:53:00,276
When you stop your stupid antics.

457
00:53:03,248 --> 00:53:05,910
Is this real or false?

458
00:53:06,417 --> 00:53:09,648
Go close and check.
You'll know if he stings you.

459
00:53:16,361 --> 00:53:19,888
This is a cobra with mystical power.

460
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:22,558
And he wishes to ask you something.

461
00:53:23,101 --> 00:53:25,262
What does the king of
snakes wish to ask me?

462
00:53:25,637 --> 00:53:30,768
He wishes to ask if
you will ever lock Radha up?

463
00:53:31,109 --> 00:53:34,044
- No! - Will you beat her?
- Never!

464
00:53:34,512 --> 00:53:39,381
- Will you stop Lakhan from
meeting Radha? - Sometimes.

465
00:53:39,784 --> 00:53:40,808
Never!

466
00:53:42,487 --> 00:53:45,752
- Your mother has come!
- No more magic!

467
00:53:47,492 --> 00:53:50,427
Now I'll tell your mother!

468
00:53:51,129 --> 00:53:54,929
If you ever complain to my mother...

469
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:58,359
I have another kind of magic.

470
00:53:59,103 --> 00:54:01,765
By which I'll turn you
into a pigeon!

471
00:54:02,207 --> 00:54:07,804
- Explain to him.
- Turn me into a pigeon!

472
00:54:08,479 --> 00:54:10,947
Don't challenge him!

473
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:17,913
You don't know, Lakhan and his
friends know a lot of magic.

474
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:23,220
God forbid if they really
turn you into a hen...

475
00:54:23,628 --> 00:54:28,622
I'll have to sell eggs laid
by you in your own shop!

476
00:54:34,606 --> 00:54:37,439
You should be ashamed.
You have grown up.

477
00:54:37,842 --> 00:54:39,400
Yet you behave like a kid!

478
00:54:40,478 --> 00:54:43,276
I just went to meet him out of love.

479
00:54:43,514 --> 00:54:45,709
Yes, I know your love.

480
00:54:46,217 --> 00:54:51,120
- And for whom.
- Then why don't you get them married?

481
00:54:51,623 --> 00:54:57,562
First let him find a job, let Ram
get married. Then I'll think of it.

482
00:54:58,029 --> 00:55:01,590
- Then get Ram married.
- He should like a girl for that.

483
00:55:01,899 --> 00:55:03,161
There is a girl.

484
00:55:03,635 --> 00:55:07,366
- Who?
- The commissioner's daughter.

485
00:55:11,476 --> 00:55:15,435
Her love story with brother
is going on for a year now!

486
00:55:15,947 --> 00:55:17,574
Shut up! Shameless!

487
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:21,719
Is it possible that he likes
somebody and I don't know about it?

488
00:55:22,053 --> 00:55:24,681
It is possible.
It is happening.

489
00:55:25,156 --> 00:55:28,216
- Do you have any proof?
- I have proof.

490
00:55:28,593 --> 00:55:29,958
- Show me.
- Reward?

491
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:32,158
You'll get whatever you want.

492
00:55:32,597 --> 00:55:36,897
Then you will talk to Devdhar uncle
about Radha and me, won't you?

493
00:55:37,201 --> 00:55:38,998
Yes I will.

494
00:55:40,238 --> 00:55:41,899
- First the proof.
- In a minute.

495
00:55:44,742 --> 00:55:48,838
Drop mother home. Now I'll return
only after getting the proof.

496
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:52,944
Now see how he manages to
get things by fraud.

497
00:55:56,721 --> 00:55:59,281
- Sir, call for you.
- Who is it?

498
00:55:59,624 --> 00:56:01,888
It's a girl, for you.

499
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:09,731
Sir, I'm Shantabai.

500
00:56:10,201 --> 00:56:15,639
- Yes? - My mistress, Geeta
wants you to come home immediately.

501
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:21,068
She had a fall. She's badly hurt.

502
00:56:22,146 --> 00:56:23,170
I'll be there soon.

503
00:56:27,785 --> 00:56:29,980
Shantabai here.

504
00:56:31,589 --> 00:56:34,319
Dev Anand here.

505
00:56:35,326 --> 00:56:39,956
Ram's assistant. How are you?
Are you fine?

506
00:56:41,332 --> 00:56:44,665
Tell your mistress that
my sir has said what?

507
00:56:45,403 --> 00:56:47,735
Get ready, to go out.

508
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:52,031
Time is short, destination
is far but have to go.

509
00:57:00,952 --> 00:57:03,750
Call up the office and find out
if Mr. Ram has left or not.

510
00:57:04,389 --> 00:57:07,222
What does he think of himself?
No sign of him for four days!

511
00:57:07,658 --> 00:57:09,421
Not a care about how I am!
And today!

512
00:57:09,861 --> 00:57:14,093
Suddenly he misses me so
he asks Dev Anand to call me up!

513
01:03:17,261 --> 01:03:18,922
Long live brother Ram!

514
01:03:19,497 --> 01:03:22,523
Long live sister-in-law Geeta!

515
01:04:14,251 --> 01:04:20,156
This is India not America.
Ride the horse slowly.

516
01:04:25,062 --> 01:04:26,893
God knows where he has gone.

517
01:04:27,598 --> 01:04:31,056
God knows what he has
eaten and grown up!

518
01:04:45,850 --> 01:04:48,318
A pearl in the sea!

519
01:05:06,971 --> 01:05:12,068
Thakur Bishambarnath's son, Debu.

520
01:05:26,891 --> 01:05:28,085
Who is Lakhan?

521
01:05:34,465 --> 01:05:35,159
Who are you?

522
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:44,298
The son of the witch my Dad
threw out of the house!

523
01:05:45,309 --> 01:05:46,298
She had committed theft!

524
01:05:49,313 --> 01:05:50,473
Scoundrel!

525
01:06:12,369 --> 01:06:13,802
I'll set you right!

526
01:06:35,459 --> 01:06:39,555
Save him!

527
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:00,713
Somebody save him!

528
01:07:13,163 --> 01:07:14,255
Son of a rascal!

529
01:07:16,467 --> 01:07:17,866
You abused my mother!

530
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:27,006
Lakhan is beating him up! Stop him!

531
01:07:29,146 --> 01:07:32,081
Bastard! I won't spare you!

532
01:07:37,921 --> 01:07:39,946
Take him away!

533
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:43,082
I won't spare you!

534
01:08:02,012 --> 01:08:04,810
Don't hold me back!
This dog abused mother!

535
01:08:15,459 --> 01:08:19,452
You won't hit him. For my sake!
For your brother's sake!

536
01:08:21,365 --> 01:08:22,730
Calm down.

537
01:08:25,069 --> 01:08:26,764
This was not good.

538
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:32,803
The entire village is witness
that Lakhan hit Debu!

539
01:08:41,151 --> 01:08:44,279
My baby! Open your eyes my love!

540
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:51,227
God knows what revenge
the rascals have taken!

541
01:08:51,862 --> 01:08:55,229
Kill the rascal!
Or complain to the police!

542
01:08:55,632 --> 01:09:00,160
No! This is no police matter.

543
01:09:00,771 --> 01:09:04,036
This is a family feud.

544
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:12,406
Just call that grocer here.

545
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:38,301
Exquisite!
I approve of your choice.

546
01:09:44,114 --> 01:09:49,916
My son wishes to marry your daughter.

547
01:09:50,888 --> 01:09:54,824
It's my good fortune that
my daughter, in this huge house...

548
01:09:55,526 --> 01:10:00,395
But the problem is the girl
is slightly underage.

549
01:10:01,098 --> 01:10:06,730
That's no problem.
Debu will wait for a year.

550
01:10:07,204 --> 01:10:11,300
For her, I'll wait for many years!

551
01:10:14,044 --> 01:10:16,945
- So the girl is ours.
- Absolutely!

552
01:10:17,548 --> 01:10:20,745
We'll get them married
whenever we wish.

553
01:10:20,951 --> 01:10:23,920
As you wish. My Radha will
only become your daughter-in-law.

554
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:34,222
Hey you! Here, eat this!

555
01:10:34,898 --> 01:10:40,359
Look, now you're going to be
the bride of a respected family.

556
01:10:41,038 --> 01:10:45,441
Not the beloved of that
hooligan, ruffian, loafer Lakhan!

557
01:10:45,943 --> 01:10:50,505
Understood? Here.

558
01:10:52,616 --> 01:10:55,517
- Open your mouth.
- Eat it. He's giving it with love.

559
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:58,679
Eat it.

560
01:11:35,859 --> 01:11:37,850
They want to ruin my life!

561
01:11:39,429 --> 01:11:40,361
I have understood.

562
01:11:41,431 --> 01:11:46,767
By buying Devdhar, they have thrown
another stone at our happiness!

563
01:11:47,471 --> 01:11:48,597
I'll set their house aflame!

564
01:11:49,273 --> 01:11:52,868
- Will you do just what they did?
- Then what do I do?

565
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:55,435
The brave don't lower their heads.

566
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:01,042
Make yourself so big that their eyes
automatically close by your glitter.

567
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:05,049
But in the meanwhile at least
talk to Radha's father.

568
01:12:05,922 --> 01:12:11,451
Your mother may have carried
the stigma of poverty for 17 years.

569
01:12:11,928 --> 01:12:16,422
But she never let go of the
rag of her self-respect.

570
01:12:17,134 --> 01:12:20,865
We have to make others bend,
not bend before others.

571
01:12:25,075 --> 01:12:28,306
Becoming a big man
means becoming rich.

572
01:12:29,246 --> 01:12:30,941
And there are only
2 ways of doing it.

573
01:12:31,515 --> 01:12:33,949
Either become a smuggler
or a police officer.

574
01:12:34,318 --> 01:12:41,121
- Meaning? - Simple. Pocket what
men like Bishambar make.

575
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:45,054
But how do I become
a police officer?

576
01:12:45,462 --> 01:12:48,863
Why don't you meet Daddy for a job?

577
01:12:49,266 --> 01:12:53,225
- How can I?
- Meet him, do something.

578
01:12:53,603 --> 01:12:58,040
Create such an aura that
everyone is left agape!

579
01:13:10,287 --> 01:13:12,312
- You haven't eaten anything.
- Water.

580
01:13:14,991 --> 01:13:17,391
We've just got news that Kesariya
Vilayati is hiding in our area.

581
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:21,224
If we don't nab him now,
our image will take a beating.

582
01:13:21,665 --> 01:13:23,189
- How are you son?
- Fine uncle.

583
01:13:29,539 --> 01:13:31,666
Can I become a police officer?

584
01:13:32,242 --> 01:13:34,210
Sure. Why not?

585
01:13:35,011 --> 01:13:37,980
To serve the country
or to earn money?

586
01:13:38,348 --> 01:13:41,749
Both. Can I?

587
01:13:48,725 --> 01:13:52,092
Yes sir, all efforts
are on to nab him

588
01:13:56,032 --> 01:14:00,799
Only one man can tell us his
whereabouts. The barber, Dhondhu.

589
01:14:02,472 --> 01:14:08,069
A lion is hiding in a stable!

590
01:14:09,146 --> 01:14:12,513
Even the police's grandfather
can never guess this place!

591
01:14:24,261 --> 01:14:29,927
The brave don't attack
an unharmed dacoit!

592
01:14:30,467 --> 01:14:32,025
Who the hell are you?

593
01:14:32,702 --> 01:14:36,638
Great man, I'm the
grandson of Sultana.

594
01:14:37,774 --> 01:14:39,366
The police is chasing me.

595
01:14:57,494 --> 01:15:00,520
Sultana's son, a bad man?

596
01:15:01,531 --> 01:15:03,726
Good man not bad man!

597
01:15:04,901 --> 01:15:07,699
- The police?
- My private police!

598
01:15:11,741 --> 01:15:16,872
I'm Ram's brother Lakhan.
Let's go to the police station!

599
01:15:21,885 --> 01:15:24,183
What? Kesariya is caught!

600
01:15:25,422 --> 01:15:28,516
Lakhan caught him?
Are you sure?

601
01:15:32,929 --> 01:15:34,658
That was terrific!

602
01:15:35,165 --> 01:15:39,898
What my force couldn't do in 10 days,
you've managed in 8 hours!

603
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:48,473
Actually, sir, your force
is becoming somewhat lazy.

604
01:15:49,379 --> 01:15:54,248
If they use some brains,
a little guts and some courage...

605
01:15:54,584 --> 01:15:56,518
What are these criminals?

606
01:15:57,521 --> 01:16:00,388
We catch such men everyday!

607
01:16:24,848 --> 01:16:31,481
Seeing your bravery and intelligence,
a thought comes to mind.

608
01:16:32,722 --> 01:16:34,747
Why don't you join the police?

609
01:16:40,397 --> 01:16:46,461
Sir, this used to be my dream,
to serve the nation and its' people.

610
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:52,264
But my brother doesn't believe
that I'm capable of anything.

611
01:16:52,976 --> 01:16:55,945
If I say I want to become a
police officer, he'll say. ' No! '

612
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:59,412
I too have some qualities.

613
01:17:06,523 --> 01:17:11,483
And I recommend your name for
the special training force.

614
01:17:11,828 --> 01:17:12,954
You get ready to leave.

615
01:17:15,098 --> 01:17:16,656
Sir are you pulling my leg?

616
01:17:18,668 --> 01:17:23,799
Then should I go and tell mother
I have become a police inspector?

617
01:17:24,407 --> 01:17:26,568
Not become, but will become.

618
01:17:39,289 --> 01:17:43,020
Now he'll tell you the same things
about me that I already told you,

619
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:53,860
I've heard everything. What
you're about to do is not right.

620
01:17:54,504 --> 01:17:58,031
He's very childish. He doesn't know
the responsibility of an officer.

621
01:17:58,908 --> 01:18:00,899
He's my brother.
I know him very well.

622
01:18:01,544 --> 01:18:03,444
Once he becomes an officer,
there will be total chaos!

623
01:18:04,881 --> 01:18:08,977
You're saying the same things
he told me you'd say.

624
01:18:09,319 --> 01:18:11,787
- But sir...
- No buts.

625
01:18:12,155 --> 01:18:16,023
He's your darling brother.
And seems like a child to you.

626
01:18:16,459 --> 01:18:19,792
But look at him from my eyes.
I recognize the diamond well.

627
01:18:20,397 --> 01:18:21,921
- After all I did find you too.
- But sir...

628
01:18:43,019 --> 01:18:45,510
I too will cry if you cry.

629
01:18:46,156 --> 01:18:48,716
I'm only going for
a 6-month training.

630
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:51,559
She's crying as if
I'm going to war!

631
01:18:51,728 --> 01:18:55,664
And I'll never return.
Brother why is everyone crying?

632
01:18:56,099 --> 01:19:00,263
Son, everyone is worried
that you might fail.

633
01:19:02,105 --> 01:19:05,438
Laxman can't fail when
he has Ram's blessings with him.

634
01:19:05,842 --> 01:19:07,207
And I have it.

635
01:19:11,014 --> 01:19:16,748
I pray to God that when you return
you're wearing... not this cap...

636
01:19:17,487 --> 01:19:20,012
But a police officer's cap!

637
01:19:20,990 --> 01:19:24,858
And you become the greatest
police officer in India!

638
01:19:29,232 --> 01:19:30,961
Hurry up or you'll miss the train!

639
01:19:33,369 --> 01:19:34,165
I'm going.

640
01:19:35,839 --> 01:19:37,329
He still has to meet Radha.

641
01:19:40,009 --> 01:19:42,500
What will happen to me?

642
01:19:43,346 --> 01:19:44,472
They will take me away!

643
01:19:45,348 --> 01:19:48,010
I'm going away to become
a weapon for the enemy.

644
01:19:49,219 --> 01:19:52,746
If they get me married
behind your back?

645
01:19:54,124 --> 01:19:58,618
- But we're already married.
- When?

646
01:19:59,596 --> 01:20:04,431
- In a previous birth, in heaven.
- Heaven?

647
01:20:05,201 --> 01:20:06,930
- Do you want to see it?
- Yes. Where is it?

648
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:11,773
There, in the moon.

649
01:20:12,575 --> 01:20:15,908
- Can you see it?
- I can't.

650
01:20:18,915 --> 01:20:20,280
Look at the moon.

651
01:20:21,818 --> 01:20:22,876
At the moon, not me.

652
01:20:24,087 --> 01:20:24,815
Shut your eyes.

653
01:20:26,523 --> 01:20:30,721
Say, Om 3 times. Stretch it.

654
01:21:06,296 --> 01:21:08,264
I'll fulfill my word.

655
01:21:09,766 --> 01:21:10,926
Wait for me.

656
01:21:24,314 --> 01:21:28,250
Debu says he wants to
go out with Radha.

657
01:21:28,952 --> 01:21:32,820
I told him in our family girls don't
go out before they are married.

658
01:21:33,323 --> 01:21:36,724
So he immediately agreed.
This is called family upbringing.

659
01:21:42,799 --> 01:21:43,891
A husband should be like this.

660
01:21:44,567 --> 01:21:49,504
Yes a husband must be like him.

661
01:21:59,082 --> 01:22:00,879
Lakhan still hasn't returned.

662
01:22:04,687 --> 01:22:08,623
Bishambar and Bhanu have invited
both of us for Debu's birthday.

663
01:22:09,626 --> 01:22:10,524
You may go. I won't.

664
01:22:11,461 --> 01:22:13,725
You'll have to go. For Radha.

665
01:22:14,497 --> 01:22:17,125
She has nobody else.
Lakhan too isn't here.

666
01:22:21,237 --> 01:22:26,675
What? You invited Ram for
Debu's birthday party?

667
01:22:29,245 --> 01:22:32,612
I've even sent his
mother an invitation.

668
01:22:33,583 --> 01:22:41,285
So that she comes and sees
how her honor, her arrogance...

669
01:22:41,691 --> 01:22:44,159
...is being crushed under my shoe!

670
01:22:45,161 --> 01:22:50,064
- I haven't understood.
- Radha was to marry Lakhan.

671
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,331
The whole city knows that.

672
01:22:53,236 --> 01:23:02,838
That same Radha in public, will put
her arms around Debu not Lakhan!

673
01:23:04,013 --> 01:23:09,883
I'll make the wretch dance
amidst the prostitute's.

674
01:23:10,253 --> 01:23:12,221
No, I won't go there.

675
01:23:12,922 --> 01:23:15,584
I don't want to go there!

676
01:23:16,292 --> 01:23:25,132
A woman's struggle is fought with
her determination not her tears.

677
01:23:26,402 --> 01:23:32,568
If you have the determination
and true love in your heart...

678
01:23:33,109 --> 01:23:35,771
It won't take long
for them to crash down.

679
01:23:38,114 --> 01:23:41,982
The whole world will watch.

680
01:23:43,653 --> 01:23:49,956
Whichever song you sing should be
in praise of Debu and this family.

681
01:24:00,837 --> 01:24:02,600
Welcome!

682
01:24:02,772 --> 01:24:07,266
This party lacked the sun and moon.
They too have arrived!

683
01:24:07,744 --> 01:24:10,406
Blessed are we that Ram came here!

684
01:24:14,717 --> 01:24:15,945
Please come in.

685
01:24:18,821 --> 01:24:23,690
Take a seat. This is a special
seat for special guests only.

686
01:24:24,427 --> 01:24:25,587
See, Ram has come.

687
01:24:36,472 --> 01:24:37,234
Brothers...

688
01:24:37,974 --> 01:24:46,439
Shastri's daughter, on the occasion
of our son, Debu's birthday...

689
01:24:46,716 --> 01:24:49,879
...will sing a melodious song.

690
01:24:54,190 --> 01:25:01,187
Some people may appreciate
her song and dance.

691
01:25:01,931 --> 01:25:05,628
And some may not like it.
But those who don't approve...

692
01:25:06,202 --> 01:25:08,932
...should keep sitting
in their seats.

693
01:25:09,272 --> 01:25:15,507
They mustn't leave because even if
prostitutes are singing, dancing...

694
01:25:15,945 --> 01:25:19,073
The party is of decent people.

695
01:25:22,351 --> 01:25:28,756
Gifted girl, get up.
Everybody's eyes are on you.

696
01:25:29,325 --> 01:25:33,489
Begin your song before us.

697
01:25:34,230 --> 01:25:38,428
Come on. Get up.

698
01:25:42,672 --> 01:25:45,368
See how pretty she is.

699
01:25:46,476 --> 01:25:47,943
Sit in front of Debu.

700
01:31:08,197 --> 01:31:10,188
Which Lakhan are you talking about?

701
01:32:08,624 --> 01:32:09,989
I'll kill you!

702
01:34:21,259 --> 01:34:23,955
Have you explained our
problem to Sir John?

703
01:34:24,329 --> 01:34:25,421
- Yes.
- She's told him.

704
01:34:27,532 --> 01:34:32,162
You will be punished because
you cheated Sir John in business!

705
01:34:33,605 --> 01:34:36,005
Not me sir. That was Shankar.

706
01:34:36,775 --> 01:34:38,106
- Whose man was he?
- Mine.

707
01:34:38,710 --> 01:34:40,200
- Who made this promise?
- I did.

708
01:34:41,012 --> 01:34:42,138
Then who should be punished?

709
01:34:45,951 --> 01:34:47,543
Take the body away!

710
01:34:54,826 --> 01:34:59,456
If you say, we'll come another day.

711
01:34:59,998 --> 01:35:01,465
Don't be afraid. Come with me.

712
01:35:11,876 --> 01:35:13,002
How are you?

713
01:35:13,945 --> 01:35:16,573
Bibiya must have told you everything.

714
01:35:19,517 --> 01:35:22,918
Sir John feels it's more important
to release Kesariya from prison...

715
01:35:23,254 --> 01:35:25,814
Rather than kill Ram and Lakhan.

716
01:35:26,124 --> 01:35:29,287
- Why? - Because our
goods worth 26 crores...

717
01:35:29,527 --> 01:35:33,896
Only Kesariya knows where
it is hidden across the border.

718
01:35:34,332 --> 01:35:39,463
Our problems have increased since
Lakhan became a police officer.

719
01:35:41,673 --> 01:35:46,975
But we've heard that Inspector
Lakhan wants to shake hands with you.

720
01:35:47,345 --> 01:35:49,779
This is his trick.

721
01:35:50,248 --> 01:35:53,843
You have to make Lakhan your arrow

722
01:35:54,119 --> 01:35:58,021
An arrow before which
even Ram is helpless.

723
01:35:58,423 --> 01:36:01,756
If we play games, so will they.

724
01:36:04,429 --> 01:36:06,124
Let them play.

725
01:36:07,465 --> 01:36:10,127
We'll play later.

726
01:36:13,605 --> 01:36:15,698
It's thanks to your devotion that...

727
01:36:16,074 --> 01:36:19,407
Ram is a senior inspector today.

728
01:36:19,744 --> 01:36:22,406
And Lakhan too is in the force.

729
01:36:24,049 --> 01:36:27,246
I've heard you're going
on a 2 month pilgrimage.

730
01:36:28,319 --> 01:36:33,951
Yes, it was my desire...

731
01:36:34,626 --> 01:36:42,761
The day my sons would be settled,
I'd go on a pilgrimage to Amarnath.

732
01:36:44,335 --> 01:36:48,863
I can understand what
a struggle it must have been.

733
01:36:49,974 --> 01:36:55,139
The struggle is over not the war.

734
01:36:57,082 --> 01:36:59,016
The battle is about to begin.

735
01:36:59,317 --> 01:37:02,252
I have to win this war.

736
01:37:03,888 --> 01:37:06,686
I've seen enough poverty in my life.

737
01:37:07,625 --> 01:37:13,586
But if you keep giving me
these little boxes of chocolate...

738
01:37:14,732 --> 01:37:17,428
Then what will happen to my
program of poverty eradication?

739
01:37:19,237 --> 01:37:22,570
First let the job get done.
Then you'll get big boxes too.

740
01:37:26,744 --> 01:37:28,006
Come in brother.

741
01:37:29,514 --> 01:37:32,210
Just to remind you that we have to
go to the station to drop mother.

742
01:37:32,517 --> 01:37:35,008
I know. You go ahead. I'm on my way.

743
01:37:38,289 --> 01:37:43,818
I mean does anybody bring
chocolates to the police station?

744
01:37:44,295 --> 01:37:47,787
Call me home. We'll eat there.
We'll fill our stomach.

745
01:37:48,133 --> 01:37:52,900
And as you've given this with love,
let it remain close to my heart.

746
01:37:53,605 --> 01:37:54,333
Your job will be done.

747
01:38:04,616 --> 01:38:06,106
Live long my children.

748
01:38:07,051 --> 01:38:11,420
Always love each other like this.

749
01:38:42,687 --> 01:38:45,349
- Brother?
- Have you eaten?

750
01:38:46,057 --> 01:38:48,548
Would I have eaten without you?

751
01:38:49,294 --> 01:38:53,196
Thought I'd play the tambourine.
I'll warm up dinner.

752
01:38:58,269 --> 01:38:59,497
Come and sit here.

753
01:39:01,372 --> 01:39:08,141
When you were born, I ran
and shouted at the top of my voice...

754
01:39:08,613 --> 01:39:12,174
My brother has come!
My Lakhan has come!

755
01:39:13,384 --> 01:39:14,749
Yes, mother did tell me.

756
01:39:15,787 --> 01:39:19,518
She must have also told you
why Dad named us Ram and Lakhan.

757
01:39:20,491 --> 01:39:22,584
To destroy the evil!

758
01:39:25,730 --> 01:39:29,461
To follow the ideals
of Lord Ram and Laxman.

759
01:39:30,935 --> 01:39:36,271
These are old tales. These days
Ramayana is just a book.

760
01:39:36,674 --> 01:39:38,403
It's just a drama, a TV serial.

761
01:39:38,943 --> 01:39:40,968
Everybody enjoys watching it
but following it is different.

762
01:39:41,546 --> 01:39:43,343
Times have changed.

763
01:39:43,715 --> 01:39:47,014
Times keep changing and
will continue to change.

764
01:39:47,885 --> 01:39:51,787
But the ideals of Ramayana
existing for thousands of years...

765
01:39:52,123 --> 01:39:56,617
...has never been and can never be
changed by a man living for 80 years!

766
01:39:57,395 --> 01:39:59,420
You and I are nothing at all!

767
01:39:59,998 --> 01:40:01,625
I don't understand you.

768
01:40:01,866 --> 01:40:05,199
I'll explain.

769
01:40:07,005 --> 01:40:10,805
The chocolate you were trying
to eat in uniform today...

770
01:40:11,175 --> 01:40:15,509
...can turn into poison tomorrow.

771
01:40:16,381 --> 01:40:20,442
And neither can Mother bear
to see you consume poison...

772
01:40:20,785 --> 01:40:22,548
Nor me.

773
01:40:23,288 --> 01:40:26,519
- I did nothing of that sort.
- Nor will you do it!

774
01:40:27,158 --> 01:40:30,252
Don't make me promise.
I put you under oath!

775
01:40:30,561 --> 01:40:31,619
Or you'll see me dead!

776
01:40:32,096 --> 01:40:33,256
No promises!

777
01:40:52,050 --> 01:40:56,077
Sir, these trucks of BB Roadways
without any checking, openly...

778
01:40:57,722 --> 01:41:01,488
The rope should be left slack
before you catch the big elephant.

779
01:41:05,396 --> 01:41:08,661
Let them go. The owners of
BB Roadways are related to me.

780
01:41:08,966 --> 01:41:14,700
Will you shame me by stopping them?

781
01:41:15,873 --> 01:41:17,067
Well done nephew.

782
01:41:18,343 --> 01:41:21,369
You've cleared our test.

783
01:41:23,214 --> 01:41:25,148
There will be chaos!

784
01:41:25,883 --> 01:41:29,250
Uncle a businessman!
Nephew a policeman!

785
01:41:30,021 --> 01:41:32,489
Peace all around!

786
01:41:33,224 --> 01:41:35,488
- My first fee.
- How much?

787
01:41:36,227 --> 01:41:37,524
A lakh.

788
01:41:40,331 --> 01:41:43,095
Give him a lakh.

789
01:41:48,172 --> 01:41:51,505
Let the relation be sealed.
Eat a sweetmeat my kid.

790
01:41:53,945 --> 01:41:56,311
Sweetmeat? Of love?

791
01:41:57,482 --> 01:42:00,178
- Eat one uncle.
- No, I'm diabetic.

792
01:42:00,318 --> 01:42:04,311
The doctor has prohibited me.
I will die if I eat it.

793
01:42:04,722 --> 01:42:05,916
- For my sake.
- I will die.

794
01:42:07,358 --> 01:42:08,689
Eat it dear uncle.

795
01:42:17,468 --> 01:42:18,662
He ate it!

796
01:42:23,274 --> 01:42:27,608
I'll pay them back for
everything they did to you!

797
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:31,278
Everything they have is ours.

798
01:42:32,483 --> 01:42:33,882
And I will get it back.

799
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:41,818
If I lose your support
in this war, I will die!

800
01:42:42,126 --> 01:42:47,257
No, I am with you.

801
01:42:48,166 --> 01:42:49,895
These are your 2 lakhs.

802
01:42:58,709 --> 01:43:02,110
- Brother?
- We want to search your bag.

803
01:43:02,713 --> 01:43:05,443
There's nothing in this.
Just something for the house.

804
01:43:05,850 --> 01:43:07,681
Search this bag.

805
01:43:09,020 --> 01:43:10,885
What are you doing?

806
01:43:18,296 --> 01:43:19,593
- Sir, this bag?
- Quickly open it.

807
01:43:22,066 --> 01:43:22,760
Get married soon.

808
01:43:29,974 --> 01:43:31,441
I don't understand one thing.

809
01:43:31,876 --> 01:43:35,073
By some way Lakhan has
become an inspector.

810
01:43:35,446 --> 01:43:37,209
But how has he got so much money?

811
01:43:37,849 --> 01:43:41,250
He wields a lot of clout.

812
01:43:41,686 --> 01:43:43,950
He locks up anyone.

813
01:43:44,455 --> 01:43:46,980
He has turned crazy!

814
01:43:47,725 --> 01:43:50,626
You know the owner of BB Roadways?

815
01:43:50,962 --> 01:43:53,522
He lost his tongue before him!

816
01:43:53,798 --> 01:43:56,995
Sit up! I don't lose my tongue
before anybody at all!

817
01:43:58,436 --> 01:44:00,028
- You've lost it!
- What? - Hour tongue!

818
01:44:00,505 --> 01:44:01,733
How?

819
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:10,838
Surround the shop!

820
01:44:11,215 --> 01:44:14,378
Keep sitting! People manipulate
things in changing positions!

821
01:44:15,052 --> 01:44:16,849
- You've been raided!
- What?

822
01:44:17,121 --> 01:44:21,421
From today I'm not brother
but Inspector Lakhan Pratap Singh!

823
01:44:24,562 --> 01:44:28,521
Read out the public's complaints.

824
01:44:28,966 --> 01:44:33,164
Complaints against you.
Listen! Report number 1

825
01:44:33,538 --> 01:44:35,597
He mixes stones in the rice.

826
01:44:35,873 --> 01:44:38,137
- Report 2? - He sticks extra
weight to the bottom of the scale.

827
01:44:38,442 --> 01:44:41,639
- Report number 3?
- He stocks oil in the room inside.

828
01:44:43,147 --> 01:44:45,012
The punishment for
adulteration and hoarding?

829
01:44:45,383 --> 01:44:47,874
3 years imprisonment.

830
01:44:48,152 --> 01:44:50,382
And a fine of 50000 rupees!

831
01:44:51,822 --> 01:44:53,414
Sound!

832
01:44:54,292 --> 01:44:58,786
- Listen, son. - Do law keepers
listen to the people or criminals?

833
01:44:59,330 --> 01:45:03,061
I find you very cute
when you scold me.

834
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:09,171
This is your own shop,
your own house my son.

835
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:14,504
Will you raid your own house?
My sister, Sharda...

836
01:45:17,448 --> 01:45:19,678
You may go. I'll follow.

837
01:45:21,385 --> 01:45:26,220
This miser is making me
emotional by taking mother's name.

838
01:45:26,824 --> 01:45:29,987
He's not a miser.
He is Radha's father.

839
01:45:33,197 --> 01:45:37,861
Have you forgotten your childhood?
You'd call me uncle then.

840
01:45:38,202 --> 01:45:43,037
Radha is waiting for you.
We were just talking about you.

841
01:45:43,441 --> 01:45:47,172
Lakhan hasn't come... is what we said.

842
01:45:47,411 --> 01:45:50,107
Have tea before you leave.
Meet Radha too.

843
01:45:52,416 --> 01:45:55,351
She has made sweetmeats for you.

844
01:45:58,089 --> 01:45:59,056
On one condition.

845
01:46:01,692 --> 01:46:05,753
Only if Uncle himself
will make me tea!

846
01:46:07,331 --> 01:46:09,595
Today even his Pop will do this!

847
01:46:10,101 --> 01:46:13,298
In the meantime, come up
and meet Radha. What sir?

848
01:46:13,671 --> 01:46:15,070
Yes, yes.

849
01:46:25,783 --> 01:46:27,978
Eat the sweetmeat.

850
01:46:29,353 --> 01:46:32,618
Do you recall when I was small
Radha would feed me sweetmeats?

851
01:46:32,923 --> 01:46:36,654
Not only that, I remember
everything. You were so cute!

852
01:46:37,161 --> 01:46:42,463
Then even today I will only eat
when Radha feeds it to me.

853
01:46:44,235 --> 01:46:46,465
Feed him dear.

854
01:46:46,871 --> 01:46:48,395
The enemy has now become an inspector!

855
01:46:54,845 --> 01:46:59,942
Didn't you tell Uncle of
all the scoundrels I arrested?

856
01:47:00,351 --> 01:47:03,548
Yes, you did. Except for one.

857
01:47:03,821 --> 01:47:07,723
- Whom? - Sir, I'm ashamed
to take your name.

858
01:47:08,993 --> 01:47:16,126
I mean first of all,
he raided Seth Dhaniram.

859
01:47:16,967 --> 01:47:20,562
The second was Dinaram.
He had him hung upside down.

860
01:47:20,905 --> 01:47:23,635
And hit him in this very spot
that the sky turned red.

861
01:47:24,008 --> 01:47:26,670
I've brought gold bangles for you.

862
01:47:30,214 --> 01:47:37,177
- What will happen to us?
- Whatever I wish!

863
01:47:37,788 --> 01:47:40,382
Lakhan has manipulate little things.

864
01:47:41,492 --> 01:47:45,986
But he can't release a prisoner
like Kesariya from prison.

865
01:47:46,831 --> 01:47:49,959
To top it that case is in Ram's hands.

866
01:47:50,701 --> 01:47:53,795
Whoever's hands it be in,
I want Kesariya!

867
01:47:56,140 --> 01:47:57,004
At any cost.

868
01:47:57,641 --> 01:48:02,442
What's the relation between Bishambar
and Sir John. Where's his hideout?

869
01:48:05,516 --> 01:48:10,681
I told you a hundred times I don't
know where Sir John's hideout is!

870
01:48:11,122 --> 01:48:13,522
Where is Sir John's hideout?

871
01:48:13,624 --> 01:48:17,082
Have you heard, Biliya has
called Lakhan to her house.

872
01:48:21,465 --> 01:48:23,695
We are fully confident...

873
01:48:24,468 --> 01:48:28,598
...that you can release
Kesariya from jail.

874
01:48:29,573 --> 01:48:32,406
And we'll give you a
bungalow worth 12 lakhs.

875
01:48:32,743 --> 01:48:34,540
And 2 lakhs in cash.

876
01:48:36,180 --> 01:48:39,115
You want to be richer than Bishambar

877
01:48:39,517 --> 01:48:40,575
I even know this.

878
01:48:43,254 --> 01:48:46,485
How did you find out all this?

879
01:48:48,159 --> 01:48:52,721
Here's your advance of 2 lakhs.

880
01:48:54,865 --> 01:48:58,460
But there's only one way to
become richer than Bishambar.

881
01:48:59,236 --> 01:49:01,227
You must appease Sir John.

882
01:49:02,173 --> 01:49:04,664
Sir John will take you to the skies.

883
01:49:05,042 --> 01:49:10,241
I know that Sir John is the one
who took Bishambar to the skies!

884
01:49:12,783 --> 01:49:16,651
But some people forget their
position once they hit it rich.

885
01:49:16,987 --> 01:49:19,148
They also forget humanity.

886
01:49:19,623 --> 01:49:24,026
They think the ones
on the ground as corpses!

887
01:49:25,663 --> 01:49:29,292
By the way we think alike.

888
01:49:34,438 --> 01:49:36,702
I will positively keep my word to you.

889
01:49:46,484 --> 01:49:50,853
If Lakhan makes place in Bibiya's
heart, he'll ruin all of us!

890
01:49:51,255 --> 01:49:54,088
Then he'll sit in Sir John's
lap and shoot at us!

891
01:49:55,392 --> 01:49:58,384
This key can open
any lock in this world.

892
01:49:59,029 --> 01:50:00,394
It's called master key, my friend.

893
01:50:21,819 --> 01:50:26,882
Tell me where is Sir John's den!

894
01:50:32,696 --> 01:50:38,328
If you think you're a master
and you'll find some such key...

895
01:50:38,869 --> 01:50:43,704
...using which you'll break
out of here, you're wrong!

896
01:51:01,158 --> 01:51:02,523
Sir, Kesariya has run away!

897
01:51:02,826 --> 01:51:06,626
- What?
- I want to know how he escaped!

898
01:51:11,769 --> 01:51:14,932
I'm very pleased to meet
a player like yourself.

899
01:51:17,641 --> 01:51:19,802
He's a very capable hero.

900
01:51:21,111 --> 01:51:27,072
Sir John is hosting a grand party
in your honor for freeing Kesariya.

901
01:51:29,954 --> 01:51:33,117
May I also call my poor friends?

902
01:51:33,591 --> 01:51:37,220
- Absolutely not!
- They dance very well.

903
01:51:37,761 --> 01:51:41,094
We've seen them dance
This is western dance.

904
01:51:41,432 --> 01:51:45,095
Not what beggars dance in streets.

905
01:51:46,203 --> 01:51:49,502
Debu has called dancers from
America especially for this party.

906
01:51:50,374 --> 01:51:57,075
When my son sings and dances
even Bibiya will be astounded.

907
01:51:58,649 --> 01:52:02,949
Then why not call both parties
and have a competition?

908
01:52:03,621 --> 01:52:07,580
And I'll give the winner
anything he desires.

909
01:52:10,127 --> 01:52:12,618
Do you understand the meaning
of a reward you desire?

910
01:52:13,097 --> 01:52:15,065
He could even ask for your Radha.

911
01:52:16,767 --> 01:52:20,396
I won't even give him half a Radha!

912
01:52:21,038 --> 01:52:27,341
If you lose tonight,
we're all destined to ruination!

913
01:52:28,012 --> 01:52:31,709
I've danced for 12 years in America!

914
01:52:32,483 --> 01:52:34,974
What will these Indian fools
dance in comparison to me!

915
01:52:38,956 --> 01:52:44,622
Debu added some pills to the betel
leaf they're eating to turn them mad!

916
01:52:48,766 --> 01:52:51,166
There's something fishy in the betel.

917
01:52:53,871 --> 01:52:58,308
Be careful. The enemy is
out to destroy us.

918
01:52:59,443 --> 01:53:01,968
It must be one of our own men
who helped Kesariya escape.

919
01:53:03,013 --> 01:53:04,412
And you have to find this Ram.

920
01:53:05,649 --> 01:53:09,517
Don't forget if I don't
find him in thirty days...

921
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:12,482
I'll have to resign.

922
01:53:13,157 --> 01:53:15,455
Who could have betrayed us?

923
02:01:35,125 --> 02:01:39,323
Hearsay can be wrong but not
what you see for yourself!

924
02:01:39,729 --> 02:01:43,165
You were drunk and happy
in Sir John's party!

925
02:01:43,466 --> 02:01:46,026
Yes. I don't deny that.

926
02:01:46,636 --> 02:01:49,002
One has to be part of the gang
before one can blow its' cover.

927
02:01:49,506 --> 02:01:53,033
This was my secret mission.
I wanted to reach Sir John's house.

928
02:01:53,376 --> 02:01:55,867
Did you take the commissioner's
permission for this mission?

929
02:01:56,446 --> 02:01:57,708
Did you take help
from any other officer?

930
02:01:58,048 --> 02:02:02,508
Ram sir's method of working
is different from mine.

931
02:02:03,787 --> 02:02:07,951
Yes, they are all trying to
understand your way of working.

932
02:02:08,925 --> 02:02:13,919
How can an officer possess a house,
TV, fridge, etc. In a short while?

933
02:02:14,564 --> 02:02:18,864
Everybody knows I won a lottery.
I have proof.

934
02:02:20,003 --> 02:02:25,236
These days only people *******
win lotteries, never the poor!

935
02:02:25,709 --> 02:02:29,372
So you mean to say I'm the king
of all these nefarious activities!

936
02:02:29,446 --> 02:02:34,213
Maybe not but you are the soldier
who shuts his eyes while on duty.

937
02:02:35,252 --> 02:02:38,847
Does business and steals with
people like Jeeva and Bishambar!

938
02:02:40,523 --> 02:02:42,115
- Brother...
- Don't call me brother!

939
02:02:43,293 --> 02:02:45,761
Right now you are in a police
station, talking to your senior!

940
02:02:47,497 --> 02:02:52,400
Under such circumstances,
wouldn't it be better if...

941
02:02:52,702 --> 02:02:55,899
...such an officer is transferred
or removed from the department.

942
02:02:57,440 --> 02:03:01,774
Only my enemy can think of
removing or transferring me out.

943
02:03:02,178 --> 02:03:07,810
Or the person who envies me
my fame, my progress, my money!

944
02:03:08,718 --> 02:03:10,345
Who is jealous of my success!

945
02:03:12,422 --> 02:03:14,913
You mean I'm jealous of you?

946
02:03:15,558 --> 02:03:19,255
Bishambar and Bhanu always
told me but I never believed them!

947
02:03:19,729 --> 02:03:21,424
How can a brother be
jealous of his own sibling?

948
02:03:21,831 --> 02:03:26,825
But today I'm convinced in
matters of business and career...

949
02:03:27,137 --> 02:03:28,729
A brother can be jealous!

950
02:03:32,676 --> 02:03:33,938
You mean to say that...

951
02:03:35,312 --> 02:03:38,304
I am jealous of you?

952
02:03:38,648 --> 02:03:41,674
Yes, you are jealous of me.

953
02:03:44,754 --> 02:03:48,622
- I'm jealous of you?
- Yes, you are jealous!

954
02:03:50,193 --> 02:03:53,993
- I'm jealous of you?
- Yes, you are jealous!

955
02:03:54,631 --> 02:03:56,826
Will I be jealous of you?
Of my own brother?

956
02:03:57,834 --> 02:03:59,233
Will I be jealous of your success?

957
02:04:12,716 --> 02:04:16,311
I'm surprised that a man like you
can suddenly become so emotional!

958
02:04:18,154 --> 02:04:20,884
Yes sir, I became emotional.

959
02:04:31,701 --> 02:04:38,937
Now watch how the old woman
loses both her weapons!

960
02:04:48,685 --> 02:04:50,016
This journey is very long.

961
02:04:51,221 --> 02:04:54,520
Who knows when we'll reach home.

962
02:04:57,527 --> 02:05:00,860
We will make it with
the help of this stick.

963
02:05:02,232 --> 02:05:03,995
Someday we will reach there.

964
02:05:04,901 --> 02:05:07,369
Great! This is how
one should make progress.

965
02:05:08,772 --> 02:05:10,933
My best wishes on buying
this new bungalow.

966
02:05:11,641 --> 02:05:14,701
- All your blessings.
- Now do one more thing.

967
02:05:15,979 --> 02:05:19,676
Get a pretty little bride
to adorn this new house.

968
02:05:20,483 --> 02:05:23,111
Just what I wanted to do.

969
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:27,047
I can't even imagine you'd make
a house with your sinful earnings.

970
02:05:27,724 --> 02:05:31,922
- Who told you this?
- Brother Ram told my Dad.

971
02:05:32,595 --> 02:05:34,290
What you are and what you'll become!

972
02:05:34,831 --> 02:05:40,133
- What will I become?
- You'll go to prison!

973
02:05:41,137 --> 02:05:46,268
You've let me down! I don't want
your love! Take back your bangles!

974
02:05:47,076 --> 02:05:47,838
And forget me.

975
02:06:01,758 --> 02:06:03,350
You are great.

976
02:06:04,027 --> 02:06:07,019
Your formula number
34 fit beautifully!

977
02:06:13,970 --> 02:06:15,528
What are you doing here?
Where's Lakhan?

978
02:06:16,172 --> 02:06:18,868
- Didn't he meet you?
- What do you mean?

979
02:06:19,909 --> 02:06:22,969
- He... home...
- What? Home?

980
02:06:23,246 --> 02:06:26,272
He left home.

981
02:06:30,119 --> 02:06:33,885
He took his things
and mother's temple.

982
02:06:39,629 --> 02:06:42,564
We pay you for your chair.

983
02:06:43,233 --> 02:06:45,531
- Not for being Ram's brother!
- Meaning?

984
02:06:46,135 --> 02:06:50,663
Your brother has sworn to have
you removed from your chair!

985
02:06:51,274 --> 02:06:54,869
- Who told you this?
- We have our own CID.

986
02:06:56,379 --> 02:07:00,713
Enough. Our job is done.

987
02:07:26,476 --> 02:07:31,072
Do whatever you please.
Now I'll never come in your way.

988
02:07:33,683 --> 02:07:39,121
Before leaving mother left the
responsibility of this temple to me.

989
02:07:40,790 --> 02:07:42,314
And I've come to take this back.

990
02:07:44,294 --> 02:07:46,728
This temple will stay here only.

991
02:07:47,397 --> 02:07:49,661
It will stay where mother stays.

992
02:07:50,366 --> 02:07:53,130
Mother will stay here, with me!

993
02:07:54,037 --> 02:07:57,768
Mother will decide where she
will stay, not you.

994
02:08:00,710 --> 02:08:03,804
So till she returns,
her temple will be here.

995
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:10,344
Mother's temple will be here where
everything stinks of sinful earnings?

996
02:08:10,987 --> 02:08:14,616
Sin and virtue are words made
by old fashioned people like you!

997
02:08:15,091 --> 02:08:18,288
Who walk around with the arrogance
of virtue and righteousness!

998
02:08:18,661 --> 02:08:21,425
Who neither understand anyone's
feelings nor their pain!

999
02:08:22,065 --> 02:08:23,498
Whose pain are you talking about?

1000
02:08:25,001 --> 02:08:28,300
The one whose temple
you want to take away.

1001
02:08:29,205 --> 02:08:30,934
Have you ever thought of her pain?

1002
02:08:31,641 --> 02:08:33,370
Have you ever felt her past wounds?

1003
02:08:40,149 --> 02:08:43,778
You are talking of the old wounds
that I know very well.

1004
02:08:45,088 --> 02:08:49,422
But I'm thinking of the
wounds coming her way

1005
02:08:49,926 --> 02:08:52,486
...which will be worse
than the old wounds!

1006
02:08:53,630 --> 02:08:56,121
When she returns to see your true self

1007
02:08:56,866 --> 02:08:59,528
A thief hidden behind a uniform!

1008
02:09:00,637 --> 02:09:03,731
The law keeper who one day
will be in the hands of the law!

1009
02:09:04,641 --> 02:09:08,372
Have you ever thought
wounded she will be?

1010
02:09:08,945 --> 02:09:13,746
What will she feel when
she sees her two sons...

1011
02:09:14,183 --> 02:09:16,981
...who were her hopes,
her weapons, her strength...

1012
02:09:17,453 --> 02:09:19,978
...are now broken, fragmented!

1013
02:09:20,923 --> 02:09:22,982
You are responsible for this.

1014
02:09:24,327 --> 02:09:25,589
- I?
- Yes, you!

1015
02:09:27,363 --> 02:09:29,831
You always considered your
little brother too little!

1016
02:09:30,433 --> 02:09:33,493
Whenever I wanted to proceed,
you kept some hurdle in front of me!

1017
02:09:33,903 --> 02:09:37,134
You always tried to break
the ladder that was taking shape!

1018
02:09:38,975 --> 02:09:41,808
You told Devdhar! Commissioner!

1019
02:09:42,245 --> 02:09:45,646
Slapped and insulted me in
front of the police department!

1020
02:09:46,015 --> 02:09:50,782
You took my childhood love,
Radha away from me!

1021
02:09:52,855 --> 02:09:54,254
Now what do you want?

1022
02:09:55,892 --> 02:09:58,326
You want to take my mom away from me!

1023
02:09:59,829 --> 02:10:02,491
I have only one support.
Do you want to snatch that too?

1024
02:10:02,999 --> 02:10:05,365
Yes, I want to take away everything!

1025
02:10:05,902 --> 02:10:08,564
Because I'm your enemy not brother!

1026
02:10:09,806 --> 02:10:13,799
I'm a scoundrel! A stigma on
the name of a brother like Rama!

1027
02:10:15,011 --> 02:10:16,501
Is this what you wish to say?

1028
02:10:17,413 --> 02:10:21,850
I can take no more!

1029
02:10:22,819 --> 02:10:25,413
Waiting here for one moment
will be worse than a storm!

1030
02:10:29,559 --> 02:10:31,686
You won't take this temple.

1031
02:10:32,862 --> 02:10:33,419
Move out!

1032
02:10:37,133 --> 02:10:38,725
You've hit me enough!

1033
02:10:39,569 --> 02:10:42,299
But today I won't take it!

1034
02:10:43,106 --> 02:10:45,540
Will you beat me?

1035
02:10:46,676 --> 02:10:48,837
I won't hold my hand back
if the need arises!

1036
02:10:49,512 --> 02:10:53,346
Lift your hand! Hit me!

1037
02:11:00,623 --> 02:11:01,555
You hit me!

1038
02:11:03,459 --> 02:11:05,859
Go away or it will be calamitous!

1039
02:11:06,262 --> 02:11:08,253
It won't be calamitous!
The calamity has occurred!

1040
02:11:08,865 --> 02:11:12,528
- I won't let you take the temple
- I'll see how you stop me!

1041
02:11:22,812 --> 02:11:24,336
Let go!

1042
02:11:47,136 --> 02:11:48,364
You'll hit your brother!

1043
02:12:14,530 --> 02:12:16,521
Leave Lakhan alone!

1044
02:12:18,267 --> 02:12:20,064
You're bound by your mother!

1045
02:12:23,339 --> 02:12:25,034
For your mother's sake!

1046
02:12:27,810 --> 02:12:28,902
Drown yourselves!

1047
02:12:30,079 --> 02:12:32,377
Your mother has gone thousands
of miles away on a pilgrimage!

1048
02:12:32,782 --> 02:12:36,741
To ask God for a boon of love
for you! For unity and success!

1049
02:12:37,453 --> 02:12:41,514
And here, you have
turned into enemies!

1050
02:12:42,291 --> 02:12:43,588
That too in front of her temple!

1051
02:12:48,097 --> 02:12:49,530
Give it a thought!

1052
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:54,531
If you can't think of yourself,
think about mother!

1053
02:12:56,205 --> 02:12:58,571
Where must she be?
What must she be doing?

1054
02:13:31,440 --> 02:13:33,499
The Lord of Lords!

1055
02:13:34,777 --> 02:13:39,441
Just as you gave Lord Rama
and Laxman the boon...

1056
02:13:39,782 --> 02:13:44,446
...of courage and strength
to destroy the demons.

1057
02:13:45,655 --> 02:13:49,682
Give my Ram and Lakhan
the same boon

1058
02:13:50,493 --> 02:13:55,396
So that I can offer my
husband's remains to the Ganges.

1059
02:13:55,798 --> 02:13:57,925
And fulfill my pledge!

1060
02:14:06,175 --> 02:14:10,839
Tomorrow is going to be
a terrible night for all of us!

1061
02:14:12,848 --> 02:14:15,544
We will need you.

1062
02:14:16,485 --> 02:14:21,650
Our goods worth 51 crores will be
unloaded at the Dinapur border.

1063
02:14:23,025 --> 02:14:28,657
And Lakhan and his men will
mislead the Border Security Force.

1064
02:14:29,498 --> 02:14:34,197
So Sir John has decided to give you
5 crores for doing this job.

1065
02:14:35,504 --> 02:14:38,029
You can enjoy your life with this.

1066
02:14:38,441 --> 02:14:41,205
Put your heart into this last dive!

1067
02:14:42,011 --> 02:14:45,003
One should have a heart
in his chest to do so.

1068
02:14:45,648 --> 02:14:50,051
I mean my heart is
in your partner's fist.

1069
02:14:51,120 --> 02:14:53,350
Tell him to open his fist.

1070
02:14:54,390 --> 02:14:56,324
And return my heart, my love.

1071
02:14:57,326 --> 02:15:00,784
Sure. But who is your love?

1072
02:15:01,464 --> 02:15:07,869
The name of my love is...

1073
02:15:12,942 --> 02:15:14,432
Lakhan is our hero.

1074
02:15:15,544 --> 02:15:20,982
Hurting him now means
we'll hurt our own business.

1075
02:15:21,283 --> 02:15:23,046
No harm in promising.

1076
02:15:25,321 --> 02:15:30,224
All right sir.
We accept if you say so.

1077
02:15:32,094 --> 02:15:34,562
But our promise will only be kept...

1078
02:15:35,231 --> 02:15:38,997
...when our contraband reaches
Surya Mansion in Dinapur.

1079
02:15:41,337 --> 02:15:44,738
Yes, Surya Mansion.

1080
02:15:45,274 --> 02:15:48,505
The one next to the railway line.
There is its' picture.

1081
02:16:00,956 --> 02:16:04,255
Why did the smile on your face
vanish on seeing the picture?

1082
02:16:06,028 --> 02:16:09,964
Now only Bishambar uncle can
return my smile to me.

1083
02:16:11,400 --> 02:16:11,798
How is that?

1084
02:16:12,568 --> 02:16:15,162
Sir I don't want money in
return for tomorrow's job.

1085
02:16:15,504 --> 02:16:18,234
I want something else.

1086
02:16:20,342 --> 02:16:23,368
Your pen, Bibiya's blank paper.

1087
02:16:23,712 --> 02:16:27,273
And Bishambar uncle's signature.

1088
02:16:27,950 --> 02:16:29,474
Signature? For what?

1089
02:16:29,919 --> 02:16:36,085
Surya Mansion will be mine
from the day after tomorrow.

1090
02:16:37,293 --> 02:16:38,225
How dare you!

1091
02:16:40,396 --> 02:16:42,660
This house is in ruins.

1092
02:16:43,132 --> 02:16:44,861
It's not a ruin!

1093
02:16:46,302 --> 02:16:49,203
It's the sweat and blood of
my father and grandfather!

1094
02:16:49,738 --> 02:16:53,105
- My mother's dream!
- You won't get it at any price!

1095
02:16:53,609 --> 02:16:55,577
And I want it at any cost!

1096
02:16:56,045 --> 02:16:58,240
- What are you saying?
- I'm making a deal.

1097
02:16:58,781 --> 02:17:00,339
We're giving you 5 crores!

1098
02:17:01,016 --> 02:17:03,985
I don't want 5 crores.
I only want this house!

1099
02:17:07,156 --> 02:17:09,556
Sit down, we'll sit and decide.

1100
02:17:10,960 --> 02:17:13,895
You will also get the mansion.

1101
02:17:14,230 --> 02:17:15,629
That's my property sir!

1102
02:17:16,165 --> 02:17:21,296
People who sell diamonds don't
care for the cost of wood.

1103
02:17:22,671 --> 02:17:23,695
Give him that ruin.

1104
02:17:24,740 --> 02:17:27,607
Give him paper for the signature.

1105
02:17:33,182 --> 02:17:33,910
Sign it.

1106
02:17:37,419 --> 02:17:42,721
Lakhan will get this paper
only when we get our stuff.

1107
02:17:44,894 --> 02:17:45,792
Is the deal okay?

1108
02:17:48,330 --> 02:17:53,324
I will definitely answer the
game that rascal played with us!

1109
02:17:54,737 --> 02:17:59,436
Watch how I make him play!

1110
02:18:06,682 --> 02:18:08,274
They've come from the
CBI department, from Delhi.

1111
02:18:08,651 --> 02:18:13,679
I'm Bedi, CBI officer.
We have urgent matters to discuss.

1112
02:18:17,626 --> 02:18:19,287
You didn't go to the
station to pick up mother.

1113
02:18:19,929 --> 02:18:21,226
No, Lakhan has gone.

1114
02:18:32,141 --> 02:18:37,306
- How are you mother?
- I'm fine.

1115
02:18:38,781 --> 02:18:42,217
Do you know what boons
I've asked for both of you?

1116
02:18:45,988 --> 02:18:46,818
Where is Ram?

1117
02:18:47,790 --> 02:18:53,057
He's been put on some duty.
I'll get your luggage. Let's go.

1118
02:18:53,862 --> 02:18:55,489
Bring mother's luggage in.

1119
02:18:55,898 --> 02:19:00,062
- Where are we going?
- Come in mother.

1120
02:19:07,209 --> 02:19:08,676
Where have you brought me son?

1121
02:19:09,044 --> 02:19:10,671
- Home.
- Home?

1122
02:19:11,580 --> 02:19:13,707
Your house, our house.

1123
02:19:15,818 --> 02:19:18,878
Bring some orange juice for mother.

1124
02:19:22,725 --> 02:19:24,124
But where is Ram?

1125
02:19:27,563 --> 02:19:30,031
Sit down mother. You are tired.

1126
02:19:30,733 --> 02:19:34,760
Have a bath. I've installed a hot
water machine in the bathroom.

1127
02:19:36,038 --> 02:19:37,733
I asked where Ram is.

1128
02:19:42,978 --> 02:19:45,037
He's in his house.

1129
02:19:45,848 --> 02:19:49,477
- The old house?
- Yes mother.

1130
02:19:51,453 --> 02:19:57,449
Now brother and I have
decided to live separately.

1131
02:20:07,736 --> 02:20:12,605
Someday we have to be separated.

1132
02:20:13,976 --> 02:20:16,638
We did so today instead of tomorrow

1133
02:20:19,682 --> 02:20:26,986
You had promised me that when we
split, you'll always be with me.

1134
02:20:29,858 --> 02:20:32,588
Has the house been made or split?

1135
02:20:33,762 --> 02:20:37,721
This building, destroying...
is all in brother's hands.

1136
02:20:38,467 --> 02:20:41,129
For no reason he got angry
with me, lost his temper!

1137
02:20:41,403 --> 02:20:45,271
- Why?
- Why? Because I'm a police officer!

1138
02:20:46,709 --> 02:20:50,008
And I started earning money
soon as I become an officer.

1139
02:20:50,746 --> 02:20:52,680
I even won a lottery!

1140
02:20:53,615 --> 02:20:55,981
I became rich. And that's no crime!

1141
02:20:56,985 --> 02:21:00,318
Whatever I am today is
because of my hard work.

1142
02:21:01,056 --> 02:21:04,082
I played footsie with the world
and kept earning money!

1143
02:21:45,868 --> 02:21:50,464
Have this orange juice.

1144
02:21:55,077 --> 02:22:00,344
First of all I want to meet Ram.

1145
02:22:03,118 --> 02:22:08,317
- First drink this.
- I said I want to meet Ram first.

1146
02:22:13,395 --> 02:22:16,228
You will come back after seeing him?

1147
02:22:17,232 --> 02:22:20,292
Yes. I will come.

1148
02:22:22,805 --> 02:22:24,670
He can be arrested at any time.

1149
02:22:28,510 --> 02:22:33,038
But it's better if you stay with him.

1150
02:22:35,651 --> 02:22:37,084
He loves you a lot.

1151
02:22:39,254 --> 02:22:46,160
And you too have always
loved him more than me.

1152
02:22:48,397 --> 02:22:53,391
Doesn't matter if
we couldn't get along.

1153
02:22:53,735 --> 02:22:54,997
You will get along.

1154
02:22:56,672 --> 02:22:57,934
You are a mother.

1155
02:22:59,508 --> 02:23:00,566
Yes I know mother...

1156
02:23:02,411 --> 02:23:04,675
I know I'm your heart.

1157
02:23:06,315 --> 02:23:07,839
But I also know that...

1158
02:23:08,817 --> 02:23:12,275
Lakhan is your heartbeat.

1159
02:23:13,455 --> 02:23:15,855
Of what use is just the heart?

1160
02:23:19,528 --> 02:23:20,756
Where is the temple?

1161
02:23:26,568 --> 02:23:31,062
Take me to Lakhan.

1162
02:23:32,941 --> 02:23:35,933
Yes, I want to go to Lakhan.

1163
02:24:06,742 --> 02:24:07,970
Now what are you waiting for?

1164
02:24:10,479 --> 02:24:11,537
Nothing at all.

1165
02:24:21,690 --> 02:24:23,521
Mother has already given her decision.

1166
02:24:26,061 --> 02:24:29,519
If you wish you too
can come to this house.

1167
02:24:38,540 --> 02:24:40,974
- No!
- Mother!

1168
02:24:45,480 --> 02:24:48,142
Move aside Ram! I hold you by oath!

1169
02:24:54,656 --> 02:24:59,355
No! No!

1170
02:25:21,950 --> 02:25:24,714
This is not the result of my penance!

1171
02:25:25,721 --> 02:25:27,086
This is not justice!

1172
02:25:27,923 --> 02:25:30,289
This is injustice, not justice!

1173
02:25:31,760 --> 02:25:34,490
This is not what I'd asked for!

1174
02:25:35,263 --> 02:25:38,926
I'd wanted a war with
Bishambar and Bhanu.

1175
02:25:39,568 --> 02:25:41,695
Not between Ram and Lakhan!

1176
02:25:42,904 --> 02:25:45,668
Ram and Lakhan were my weapons.

1177
02:25:46,708 --> 02:25:49,108
And you broke my weapons!

1178
02:25:50,412 --> 02:25:54,143
Lakhan who is my own son!

1179
02:25:55,250 --> 02:25:57,912
And you cut away a part of my heart!

1180
02:25:58,553 --> 02:26:01,386
You cut a mother's heart!

1181
02:26:06,928 --> 02:26:11,365
Have mercy on me Lord!

1182
02:26:12,434 --> 02:26:15,460
Have mercy on a grief-stricken woman!

1183
02:26:31,720 --> 02:26:39,559
Your mortal remains...
will they never...

1184
02:26:39,961 --> 02:26:44,591
...be immersed in the Ganges?

1185
02:27:33,415 --> 02:27:40,685
Will your mortal remains never
be immersed in the Ganges?

1186
02:27:52,467 --> 02:27:55,903
These bones are the mortal remains
of my husband Thakur Pratap Singh.

1187
02:27:56,371 --> 02:28:01,638
He was murdered before my eyes
by Bishambar and Bhanu.

1188
02:28:28,403 --> 02:28:30,928
He is Kuldeep Bedi from
The Delhi CBI Department.

1189
02:28:31,506 --> 02:28:34,134
There are some charges on you.

1190
02:28:35,544 --> 02:28:36,806
Hence you are under arrest.

1191
02:28:38,146 --> 02:28:39,579
Here is your arrest warrant.

1192
02:28:47,322 --> 02:28:47,913
Come on.

1193
02:28:53,828 --> 02:28:57,457
Call him sir!

1194
02:28:58,033 --> 02:29:00,968
Called us home for dinner
and going out on duty?

1195
02:29:01,503 --> 02:29:02,629
Do me a favor.

1196
02:29:03,638 --> 02:29:06,300
Give mother's temple back to her.

1197
02:29:07,075 --> 02:29:12,479
And tell her Lakhan will return
only after completing your pledge!

1198
02:29:13,615 --> 02:29:19,019
Forgive me but mother's pledge
is more important than your duty!

1199
02:29:19,688 --> 02:29:22,179
Walk me till there.

1200
02:29:24,960 --> 02:29:29,090
I promise to come to you
after I finish my job.

1201
02:29:31,433 --> 02:29:32,866
Stop!

1202
02:29:34,903 --> 02:29:36,666
What are you saying?
Follow him!

1203
02:29:38,940 --> 02:29:41,534
What are you saying?
He'll be ruined this way.

1204
02:29:42,310 --> 02:29:44,710
And where's Ram? I'm on my way.

1205
02:29:48,416 --> 02:29:50,816
- What's the matter?
- Lakhan ran away from police custody.

1206
02:29:51,152 --> 02:29:54,246
Stupid boy! Ram is worried so am I.

1207
02:29:55,724 --> 02:30:00,855
The fool says his mother's pledge
is more important than police duty!

1208
02:30:22,217 --> 02:30:24,447
Welcome my nephew!

1209
02:30:26,588 --> 02:30:27,555
You are warmly welcomed.

1210
02:30:31,459 --> 02:30:33,950
Come in. Sir John is waiting for you.

1211
02:30:56,284 --> 02:30:57,615
The mines are laid
all around the mansion.

1212
02:31:00,255 --> 02:31:02,689
Both of you go home.

1213
02:31:13,435 --> 02:31:14,424
What's going on?

1214
02:31:22,978 --> 02:31:25,310
What's all this sir?

1215
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:28,410
This is in your honor.

1216
02:31:29,384 --> 02:31:32,410
You've taken the cash.
And you'll get this mansion.

1217
02:31:32,887 --> 02:31:35,583
As well as the queen of your dreams!

1218
02:31:35,957 --> 02:31:38,118
She'll come breezing in.

1219
02:31:39,027 --> 02:31:41,655
But do you remember your promise?

1220
02:31:42,330 --> 02:31:46,664
You have to take our trucks across
the border before the sun rises.

1221
02:31:48,436 --> 02:31:49,698
Yes sir. I am ready.

1222
02:31:50,205 --> 02:31:52,605
Give him his uniform.

1223
02:32:00,882 --> 02:32:02,144
I'll go without my uniform.

1224
02:32:03,284 --> 02:32:04,842
Because everybody there recognizes me.

1225
02:32:05,186 --> 02:32:07,711
There will be no fun
without the uniform.

1226
02:32:08,690 --> 02:32:10,487
- But sir I...
- Wear the uniform.

1227
02:32:15,263 --> 02:32:19,063
Now I can't wear this uniform.

1228
02:32:21,736 --> 02:32:24,364
Don't play games with me.
Wear the uniform.

1229
02:32:24,873 --> 02:32:26,101
Wear it son.

1230
02:32:27,342 --> 02:32:30,573
- Wear the uniform.
- Wear it bad man.

1231
02:32:31,179 --> 02:32:32,111
I said I won't wear it.

1232
02:32:32,614 --> 02:32:35,310
- Wear it.
- I said I won't wear it!

1233
02:32:37,218 --> 02:32:39,413
Son wear the uniform!

1234
02:32:45,493 --> 02:32:47,222
So you won't wear the uniform!

1235
02:32:48,563 --> 02:32:49,393
You won't wear it?

1236
02:32:54,869 --> 02:32:56,029
Even your Pop will wear it!

1237
02:32:56,905 --> 02:32:57,929
You will have to wear it!

1238
02:33:01,709 --> 02:33:04,269
They know that the
police is behind you.

1239
02:33:04,813 --> 02:33:07,782
Also why you have come here!
Why did you tell lies?

1240
02:33:15,290 --> 02:33:17,986
He too has failed.

1241
02:33:18,693 --> 02:33:21,321
So we'll have to pass him too.

1242
02:33:22,130 --> 02:33:23,757
Before that...

1243
02:33:24,265 --> 02:33:29,498
At least let him see the
queen of his dreams once.

1244
02:33:32,607 --> 02:33:35,269
Sure. Why not?

1245
02:33:51,392 --> 02:33:53,360
Congratulations.

1246
02:33:53,995 --> 02:33:56,725
Best wishes on your fifth wedding.

1247
02:33:57,966 --> 02:34:02,198
This is a beautiful present
from us for you.

1248
02:34:04,873 --> 02:34:07,433
Bastard! Scoundrel!

1249
02:34:13,948 --> 02:34:14,676
Beat the rascal!

1250
02:34:17,986 --> 02:34:19,578
Beat the living daylights out of him!

1251
02:34:28,163 --> 02:34:32,099
My brother has committed crimes
but somebody else is behind it.

1252
02:34:32,901 --> 02:34:36,632
Yes, a conspiracy. You have seen
the plant but the root is elsewhere.

1253
02:34:40,408 --> 02:34:41,397
Sir John here.

1254
02:34:43,011 --> 02:34:45,639
Your brother is with us,
pleading for his life.

1255
02:34:46,481 --> 02:34:50,247
We thought the job that Lakhan
couldn't complete will be done by Ram.

1256
02:34:51,219 --> 02:34:53,346
You can save your
brother's life if you wish.

1257
02:34:54,289 --> 02:34:56,223
My men will explain everything to you.

1258
02:34:57,358 --> 02:35:02,057
You will come alone to check post
number 7. You means only you.

1259
02:35:02,564 --> 02:35:05,863
So now we have to work with the
scare of Sir John's threats!

1260
02:35:06,167 --> 02:35:08,067
The entire police department
is put to shame like this.

1261
02:35:08,303 --> 02:35:10,066
This will never happen.

1262
02:35:11,005 --> 02:35:13,473
Does this mean we leave
Lakhan there, to die?

1263
02:35:14,342 --> 02:35:16,572
- Are you in your senses?
- What else do we do?

1264
02:35:17,111 --> 02:35:20,638
- Do we bend before them?
- Yes. Ram will have to bend.

1265
02:35:21,549 --> 02:35:23,949
Because I know Lakhan is his life.

1266
02:35:24,519 --> 02:35:26,919
And Ram can't live without Lakhan.

1267
02:35:27,322 --> 02:35:29,722
I'll stay without him.
I'll manage to survive!

1268
02:35:30,525 --> 02:35:33,517
Will he test me each time?
Give me sorrow?

1269
02:35:34,662 --> 02:35:35,924
I'll live without him.

1270
02:35:52,213 --> 02:35:55,944
You didn't believe what I said.
Now see it for yourself.

1271
02:35:58,786 --> 02:36:00,720
It's just love.

1272
02:36:02,490 --> 02:36:05,015
Lakhan will marry Bibiya.

1273
02:36:10,598 --> 02:36:12,589
It's been 9 hours
since they took Radha.

1274
02:36:13,034 --> 02:36:14,626
- Who took her?
- Bishambar and Debu.

1275
02:36:15,536 --> 02:36:19,939
They said they want to show her
birth chart to some holy man.

1276
02:36:20,241 --> 02:36:22,436
I think they pulled
wool over your eyes.

1277
02:36:22,844 --> 02:36:26,245
Tell him about Lakhan.

1278
02:36:27,081 --> 02:36:32,178
Before you do any drama
in tonight's party...

1279
02:36:33,321 --> 02:36:35,789
I ask you for the last time.

1280
02:36:37,058 --> 02:36:39,583
Do you object to marrying me?

1281
02:36:44,899 --> 02:36:47,891
No. I accept.

1282
02:36:50,305 --> 02:36:51,203
But on one condition.

1283
02:36:54,475 --> 02:36:58,138
You'll have to bring Lakhan before
me just once before the wedding.

1284
02:36:59,147 --> 02:37:02,776
- Why?
- Will you have him freed?

1285
02:37:03,251 --> 02:37:04,548
Or killed?

1286
02:37:06,454 --> 02:37:08,319
You'll get the answer only then.

1287
02:37:12,694 --> 02:37:14,059
The game will be interesting.

1288
02:37:14,329 --> 02:37:20,564
Ram will have our cocaine
taken out of the border today.

1289
02:37:21,169 --> 02:37:25,629
Till then you hear the wedding drums!

1290
02:42:35,249 --> 02:42:37,046
- Where's my Lakhan?
- What did you say?

1291
02:42:37,985 --> 02:42:39,816
Sharda has taken both
of them to Lakhan?

1292
02:42:40,788 --> 02:42:44,280
- Now she'll kill them all!
- No, she can't.

1293
02:42:44,925 --> 02:42:48,452
- How?
- If you do as we say.

1294
02:42:49,797 --> 02:42:54,029
I've done your job. As per your
word, now tell me where Lakhan is.

1295
02:42:56,170 --> 02:42:57,535
Wait.

1296
02:42:58,906 --> 02:43:03,206
- Who cheated me?
- This is my childhood habit.

1297
02:43:09,150 --> 02:43:11,084
Sir we're on our way.

1298
02:46:38,926 --> 02:46:41,019
- A shot has been fired!
- Stop this nonsense!

1299
02:46:41,495 --> 02:46:42,086
Stop the band.

1300
02:46:44,064 --> 02:46:45,031
What nonsense is this?

1301
02:46:46,233 --> 02:46:49,828
- Problem.
- What problem?

1302
02:46:51,505 --> 02:46:52,369
Are you all right?

1303
02:46:54,975 --> 02:46:56,033
What drama is this?

1304
02:46:57,244 --> 02:47:03,012
Tell him what will happen if
we tell him about the drama.

1305
02:47:03,050 --> 02:47:06,110
They will break out in sweat,
do it in their pants, like you!

1306
02:47:06,920 --> 02:47:10,048
Don't tell them.
Swear by me, you won't.

1307
02:47:10,324 --> 02:47:12,019
No my child.

1308
02:47:12,893 --> 02:47:16,954
My heart says I should
give them a warning.

1309
02:47:19,166 --> 02:47:25,002
Brother, don't let blood...
don't let your blood boil!

1310
02:47:27,675 --> 02:47:29,074
Come here.

1311
02:47:31,278 --> 02:47:33,269
In front of everyone
tell us the warning.

1312
02:47:34,815 --> 02:47:35,577
Who is he?

1313
02:47:36,850 --> 02:47:37,908
He is my friend.

1314
02:47:39,486 --> 02:47:40,714
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

1315
02:47:41,422 --> 02:47:42,912
But he looks like a smuggler.

1316
02:47:44,191 --> 02:47:49,128
If you're his friend,
explain to him...

1317
02:47:49,430 --> 02:47:51,398
...not to pick bones with smugglers!

1318
02:47:52,166 --> 02:47:57,570
- Which smuggler?
- Some squint-eyed rascal Sir John.

1319
02:47:58,639 --> 02:48:02,268
I'm going to be related to you,
so I've come to explain to you.

1320
02:48:02,810 --> 02:48:05,938
Don't play the game you
plan to with Sir John.

1321
02:48:06,280 --> 02:48:07,838
- We'll all be ruined!
- What game?

1322
02:48:08,349 --> 02:48:11,807
Let me tell him everything.
He is your friend, isn't he?

1323
02:48:12,353 --> 02:48:16,289
He'll pretend to get my daughter
married to Sir John but all false.

1324
02:48:16,690 --> 02:48:18,885
And then Sir John will be killed!

1325
02:48:19,460 --> 02:48:23,988
You tell me has Sir John worn
bangles? He too will rise in revolt!

1326
02:48:24,398 --> 02:48:26,423
And he'll hit you first
as you're his friend!

1327
02:48:26,567 --> 02:48:29,730
And then you because you're
his friend. And then me too!

1328
02:48:30,270 --> 02:48:33,103
Don't ' Devdhar' me! I won't let
you kill that bastard Sir John!

1329
02:48:34,274 --> 02:48:35,502
This is Sir John.

1330
02:48:37,878 --> 02:48:39,607
Sir John is a great scoundrel!

1331
02:48:39,913 --> 02:48:41,175
- Sir!
- He's a dog!

1332
02:48:41,548 --> 02:48:44,210
- He's a fool! And squint-eyed!
- Master!

1333
02:48:44,718 --> 02:48:48,279
What, ' master! ' It's our duty
to save the lives of relatives.

1334
02:48:48,789 --> 02:48:51,121
I won't let him murder Sir John!

1335
02:48:51,692 --> 02:48:53,557
Murder? Who will murder me?

1336
02:48:54,194 --> 02:48:57,254
Nobody is murdering you.
I mean Sir John's murder.

1337
02:48:58,031 --> 02:49:00,522
That blind man with a stone eye!

1338
02:49:00,868 --> 02:49:04,099
I am he!

1339
02:49:21,388 --> 02:49:22,514
The player had feet of clay.

1340
02:49:23,257 --> 02:49:26,351
- Listen...
- Shut up you fool!

1341
02:49:30,063 --> 02:49:32,725
Priest, begin the marriage ceremony.

1342
02:49:33,033 --> 02:49:33,931
Put tilak to the groom.

1343
02:49:39,206 --> 02:49:41,231
Now it's my turn Sir John!

1344
02:49:42,142 --> 02:49:44,440
- Devdhar Shastri.
- Long live!

1345
02:49:49,716 --> 02:49:53,982
That's wonderful! You look
just like James Bond!

1346
02:49:54,588 --> 02:49:56,920
You haven't recognized me.

1347
02:49:57,524 --> 02:50:00,357
The lion whom other lions fear.

1348
02:50:01,094 --> 02:50:02,994
His name is Devdhar.

1349
02:50:04,498 --> 02:50:07,524
This is the time for action
not dialogues.

1350
02:50:08,001 --> 02:50:10,561
- Action one.
- Bring Lakhan here.

1351
02:50:11,038 --> 02:50:12,903
- Action two.
- Send Radha with us.

1352
02:50:13,340 --> 02:50:15,137
I'll say the next.

1353
02:50:16,009 --> 02:50:20,537
Your story finishes here
and my story begins.

1354
02:50:21,582 --> 02:50:28,852
Hunting lions is neither a
grocer's job nor his destiny!

1355
02:50:29,890 --> 02:50:30,481
Look here.

1356
02:50:33,827 --> 02:50:37,763
If anybody moves an inch,
Radha will be blown to smithereens!

1357
02:50:38,799 --> 02:50:45,967
You did play your hand
but not with finesse.

1358
02:51:39,626 --> 02:51:45,155
See who is standing before you.

1359
02:51:46,700 --> 02:51:47,997
Your death!

1360
02:51:49,069 --> 02:51:51,435
Who has come at the appointed hour!

1361
02:51:52,339 --> 02:51:57,276
This is the mother of that Ram
whose brother you snatched away!

1362
02:51:59,212 --> 02:52:04,844
This is the mother of Lakhan whom
you threw down the drain of corruption

1363
02:52:05,619 --> 02:52:07,814
This is the wife of
Thakur Pratap Singh.

1364
02:52:08,322 --> 02:52:12,520
Whose stains of blood are
still on my clothes!

1365
02:52:14,895 --> 02:52:16,419
Can you see these stains?

1366
02:52:17,164 --> 02:52:22,625
Can't you see them?
Then here, have a look!

1367
02:52:32,646 --> 02:52:35,809
Take Radha away.

1368
02:52:41,955 --> 02:52:45,686
Where is my Lakhan?

1369
02:52:53,934 --> 02:52:56,129
Find the old woman! And kill her!

1370
02:53:02,909 --> 02:53:04,501
No sound.

1371
02:53:14,388 --> 02:53:14,854
Who?

1372
02:53:19,459 --> 02:53:23,725
- Did you bring the stuff?
- Kesariya never fails.

1373
02:53:25,432 --> 02:53:29,163
- Give me the money!
- No! Let it be there.

1374
02:53:29,903 --> 02:53:32,463
Mother, wait here.
I'll go and look for Lakhan.

1375
02:53:33,774 --> 02:53:35,537
First tell me who
switched off the lights?

1376
02:53:36,143 --> 02:53:42,605
If I wouldn't switch off the
lights, all of you would be fused!

1377
02:53:43,617 --> 02:53:45,915
Brother-in-law, switch on the lights.

1378
02:53:47,721 --> 02:53:51,623
No! Crush the serpent in the dark!

1379
02:54:30,063 --> 02:54:31,530
You and here?

1380
02:54:32,299 --> 02:54:34,824
Wherever the devil, Ram will be found.

1381
02:55:17,878 --> 02:55:19,106
Here is mother's sari.

1382
02:55:21,014 --> 02:55:26,816
The color of whose blood
is spreading all around this house.

1383
02:55:28,422 --> 02:55:29,286
Take this.

1384
02:55:31,057 --> 02:55:33,992
Today you have to fight but remember...

1385
02:55:34,694 --> 02:55:39,028
Not as Lakhan, but as
Inspector Lakhan Pratap Singh!

1386
02:55:41,101 --> 02:55:43,433
Here is the paper of this mansion.

1387
02:55:45,472 --> 02:55:48,532
Our victory lies in yours.

1388
02:55:51,745 --> 02:55:54,612
But I will be victorious
in this game.

1389
02:56:15,602 --> 02:56:19,834
Death stands behind you!

1390
02:56:29,449 --> 02:56:34,887
You love to make me wear
my uniform? Now put it on me.

1391
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:47,557
Come on!

1392
02:57:06,987 --> 02:57:08,386
Take mother out.

1393
02:57:10,524 --> 02:57:12,082
It's pitch dark outside.

1394
02:57:12,659 --> 02:57:14,559
- Where is Radha?
- She left with Shiva.

1395
02:57:19,366 --> 02:57:20,924
No!

1396
02:57:41,054 --> 02:57:42,612
Take Radha out.

1397
02:57:43,123 --> 02:57:45,751
Go and switch on the explosives.

1398
02:57:50,063 --> 02:57:54,022
Any sign of Lakhan?

1399
02:57:56,736 --> 02:57:58,829
Your Lakhan is alive.

1400
02:58:13,219 --> 02:58:13,913
These wounds?

1401
02:58:14,721 --> 02:58:19,488
The punishment for my deeds.

1402
02:58:22,228 --> 02:58:22,853
This uniform?

1403
02:58:24,331 --> 02:58:31,100
I now wish that when I die and
my brother gets my dead body...

1404
02:58:31,404 --> 02:58:33,099
It is of an honest inspector
Lakhan Pratap Singh!

1405
02:58:33,607 --> 02:58:37,941
And not of the cheat Lakhan
whom everyone was ashamed of!

1406
02:58:56,830 --> 02:58:59,025
See where your actions
brought all of us!

1407
02:59:00,667 --> 02:59:02,532
Is this what you wanted?

1408
02:59:05,305 --> 02:59:06,329
Were these your dreams?

1409
02:59:08,975 --> 02:59:10,306
You set off to change the world.

1410
02:59:12,979 --> 02:59:16,608
Stupid boy! You're saying sorry!

1411
02:59:27,093 --> 02:59:28,526
Go upstairs. I'll go down.

1412
02:59:35,068 --> 02:59:36,933
Blow up this mansion!

1413
02:59:49,249 --> 02:59:54,516
My son, Lakhan! I'm your uncle.

1414
02:59:55,355 --> 03:00:00,156
Uncle isn't this the room?

1415
03:00:00,627 --> 03:00:04,085
...from where you
dragged my mother out?

1416
03:00:04,964 --> 03:00:08,400
Come on! Now it's your turn!

1417
03:00:55,415 --> 03:00:59,647
Brother he's the devil
who killed our Dad!

1418
03:01:19,139 --> 03:01:22,631
Take us also.

1419
03:01:23,143 --> 03:01:27,409
You failed everything.
Now you think of me!

1420
03:01:32,218 --> 03:01:33,776
I'll get them back!

1421
03:01:43,830 --> 03:01:45,161
Surrender to the police!

1422
03:01:54,474 --> 03:01:56,874
Save her if you can.

1423
03:02:11,391 --> 03:02:13,086
Let them go.

1424
03:02:48,428 --> 03:02:50,726
Sir there's a message from the
mansion that Geeta has been kidnapped

1425
03:03:04,644 --> 03:03:08,978
Bring her here and tie her
to this same railway line.

1426
03:03:09,782 --> 03:03:12,444
Where we cut her husband to shreds!

1427
03:03:16,256 --> 03:03:19,248
Serpent! Out to sting us?

1428
03:03:36,743 --> 03:03:39,769
If you try to kill me,
keep this in mind...

1429
03:03:40,813 --> 03:03:44,909
You'll also get their dead bodies!

1430
03:03:45,985 --> 03:03:46,679
Stay put!

1431
03:04:08,007 --> 03:04:12,307
Stop. Surrender to the law.

1432
03:05:20,847 --> 03:05:21,814
You were right.

1433
03:05:23,149 --> 03:05:28,246
The ideals of Ramayana written
long ago have never changed.

1434
03:05:28,621 --> 03:05:30,782
Neither can we ever change them.

1435
03:05:36,963 --> 03:05:40,455
Do you know what I feel today?

1436
03:05:40,833 --> 03:05:45,202
I feel my Lakhan
