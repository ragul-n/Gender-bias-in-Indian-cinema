1
00:07:27,268 --> 00:07:31,227
I don't want this tea. Go.

2
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:05,831
Today it's the blue pants and
blue coat.

3
00:08:17,318 --> 00:08:21,221
- Where is the secretary?
- He has gone to jail.

4
00:08:23,824 --> 00:08:28,625
He said he'll go first and you'll
join him later.

5
00:08:31,232 --> 00:08:35,669
- Today is October 12th.
- My birthday isn't it?

6
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:40,640
It's a habit to give the
prisoners something today.

7
00:08:40,808 --> 00:08:46,804
He said he'll go and arrange
for it first and then you can go.

8
00:08:48,249 --> 00:08:55,121
- Files that need your
signature. - Spare me for today.

9
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,159
You can go.

10
00:09:15,376 --> 00:09:20,940
- How old are you?
-16.

11
00:09:22,216 --> 00:09:26,346
You should be in school. Ran
away because you couldn't afford it?

12
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:32,289
- Yes. - I don't wish you to
waste your life in the kitchen at this age.

13
00:09:32,393 --> 00:09:37,559
Get ready to go home this
evening. I'll give you a thousand rupees.

14
00:09:40,401 --> 00:09:44,565
Fine, I'll send 500 rupees
every month.

15
00:10:55,309 --> 00:11:00,679
Life sentance. He poisoned one
whole family in a internal feud.

16
00:11:13,494 --> 00:11:18,330
He strangled a 5 year old child
for gold jewelry.

17
00:11:30,411 --> 00:11:35,474
He murdered his wife out of
suspicion but now he repents it.

18
00:12:06,046 --> 00:12:10,142
Can I ask you one question?

19
00:12:11,452 --> 00:12:19,860
I've been here 3 years and
seen you here each year on your birthday.

20
00:12:20,027 --> 00:12:25,363
I suspect there is a deeper
reason for this. Am I correct?

21
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:33,030
My basis for this is merely
humanitarian.

22
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:40,308
Society fails to see the many
criminals out there.

23
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:52,584
We use circumstantial facts to
convict often. Doesn't work all the time.

24
00:12:57,931 --> 00:13:02,835
While the guilty may roam the
streets, the innocent should not be in here.

25
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:11,272
I too have been affected by
your department. - In which way?

26
00:13:11,412 --> 00:13:22,756
My father was imprisoned
wrongly and has since lived as a lunatic.

27
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:30,723
I come to present those who
may be like my father.

28
00:13:32,633 --> 00:13:36,536
If what you say is true, I feel
very sorry.

29
00:13:41,642 --> 00:13:44,634
- I'll come. - Say you're
leaving. This is the jail.

30
00:13:44,778 --> 00:13:49,716
I will come. On my next
birthday.

31
00:14:30,524 --> 00:14:34,825
-Eaten? - Yes. - Are they here
for the interview? - Yes.

32
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:41,327
- Are you all here for the
interview? - Yes.

33
00:14:41,435 --> 00:14:49,001
I am the manager. You won't
get up. It's the effect of your age.

34
00:14:49,176 --> 00:14:55,013
Give it.

35
00:14:57,718 --> 00:15:03,282
You're determined to get the
job. You will get it.

36
00:15:11,565 --> 00:15:13,590
I can see the beauty of your
heart. On your face. Give it.

37
00:15:16,804 --> 00:15:19,364
Aren't you Sabapathy
daughter?

38
00:15:20,107 --> 00:15:21,336
No, my father's name is
Gopalakrishnan

39
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:26,039
Oh the one works in LIC
building isn't it?

40
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:31,511
I know! I have seen you when
you were five years old. How is your father?

41
00:15:40,194 --> 00:15:42,219
Continue laughing, is it
expensive to laugh?

42
00:16:41,822 --> 00:16:46,851
The ladies are here sir.
Ladies are here. for the steno interview.

43
00:16:47,327 --> 00:16:51,286
You interview half while I
take care of the rest.

44
00:16:51,431 --> 00:16:55,390
There are many of them. I
thought sharing the job will make it easier.

45
00:16:59,106 --> 00:17:00,403
Go and do your work.

46
00:17:39,379 --> 00:17:41,347
Do you always dress up in this
manner?

47
00:17:42,015 --> 00:17:45,451
Sometimes I don't bother with
putting anything. I'm strict in this matter.

48
00:17:45,686 --> 00:17:51,455
You said you're of royalty yet
you're stingy with putting alms!

49
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:55,517
It's not easy to tell who the
real beggers are.

50
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:19,375
- Your name? - Lakshmi.
- Previous place of employment?

51
00:18:19,586 --> 00:18:20,280
Raja mathas'.

52
00:18:20,387 --> 00:18:23,413
- How many years?
- 5 months.

53
00:18:23,523 --> 00:18:25,719
But it was I who chose...

54
00:18:25,826 --> 00:18:31,959
- Your hobbies? - Watching
blue films, night clubs, drinks.

55
00:18:32,065 --> 00:18:37,663
Instead of making it a taboo, a
proper punishment would work.

56
00:19:25,986 --> 00:19:32,915
- Why not further your
studies? - With a MA, I still need a job.

57
00:19:33,026 --> 00:19:37,987
1 think this qualification is
sufficient for me to lead a happy life.

58
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:44,100
- Do you have any experiance?
- In what?

59
00:19:48,008 --> 00:19:52,343
I mean within steno,
receptionist, personal assistant - which of it?

60
00:19:55,015 --> 00:19:56,483
This is an interview for a
steno.

61
00:20:06,026 --> 00:20:12,864
- Why this job hopping?
-1 don't act in a subordinated manner.

62
00:20:12,966 --> 00:20:20,839
Because the job is not a
necessity for me. My brother is a pilot.

63
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:26,675
Don't make noise with that
thing.

64
00:20:32,052 --> 00:20:39,686
- What's your reaction if you
don't get this? - It's your loss.

65
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:52,395
I'll keep you. As a steno.

66
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:33,867
We have alot of new varities.
Would you like to take a look?

67
00:22:54,194 --> 00:22:58,927
- What would you like?
- Handkerchief.

68
00:23:27,227 --> 00:23:32,097
- Any other variety?
- Others..

69
00:23:41,241 --> 00:23:44,734
One is sufficient.

70
00:23:56,756 --> 00:24:00,021
I was referring to the
handkerchief.

71
00:25:16,336 --> 00:25:22,139
- What would you life?
- Handkerchief.

72
00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:45,662
Any other colour?
I like that colour.

73
00:25:46,366 --> 00:25:51,463
That rose on your hip. Yes,
that handkerchief.

74
00:25:54,474 --> 00:25:58,775
There is no stock like that.

75
00:25:58,878 --> 00:26:04,044
I would like that. - I'll contact
you when the stock comes.

76
00:26:04,851 --> 00:26:10,346
1 believe you'll give it to me.

77
00:26:12,392 --> 00:26:16,556
I was referring to the
handkerchief.

78
00:26:41,421 --> 00:26:45,324
- He comes often. Boyfriend? -
Keep quiet.

79
00:26:45,425 --> 00:26:48,451
A thousand customers may
come. Does that make them my boyfriend?

80
00:26:50,096 --> 00:26:53,555
I asked as he came often.

81
00:26:56,436 --> 00:27:00,998
None of my regulars are
young and hip.

82
00:27:01,107 --> 00:27:08,741
You've started. Look, there's a
young man there. Go there now.

83
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:24,397
- What would you like?
- A brasseire.

84
00:27:24,497 --> 00:27:31,267
- What size?
- Any size.

85
00:27:31,371 --> 00:27:36,070
Didn't your wife tell you the
size?

86
00:27:38,311 --> 00:27:43,078
1 am still not married.

87
00:27:44,484 --> 00:27:48,318
Okay, I understand.

88
00:28:05,505 --> 00:28:07,473
Connect me to the steno.

89
00:28:22,889 --> 00:28:24,721
I am Sundram speaking here.

90
00:28:24,824 --> 00:28:28,954
- Isn't Chitra there? -1 think
she hasn't come for the last 2 days.

91
00:28:29,095 --> 00:28:34,534
Connect me to the manager. -
He's elsewhere. I'll send him in.

92
00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:55,419
- Chitra didn't come? - That
has upset me alot too.

93
00:28:55,521 --> 00:28:59,685
- Great joke. Did she submit a
leave letter? - No.

94
00:28:59,926 --> 00:29:08,562
- Called? - No. - Wait for 2
days; then get someone else for the job.

95
00:29:11,571 --> 00:29:17,840
Mouli wants another
quotation. Get the papers from her table.

96
00:29:17,944 --> 00:29:21,539
Move quickly.

97
00:30:21,641 --> 00:30:25,635
- Sleeve or sleeveless?
- 1 prefer sleeveless.

98
00:30:25,778 --> 00:30:30,579
Yes, the sleeveless would look
better for you. Sleeves are for the old.

99
00:30:55,675 --> 00:30:59,543
- The next time. -Will you
come? - Certainly. At least for you.

100
00:31:09,689 --> 00:31:17,688
The stock you wanted has
come. I cut it thinking you would buy it.

101
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:26,662
Add this price to my bill as
well. I will pay for it.

102
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:31,401
Keep this as my present.

103
00:31:55,735 --> 00:32:01,367
I wasn't referring to the
handkerchief or this book.

104
00:32:07,747 --> 00:32:12,014
- Do you love that man?
- Nothing like that.

105
00:32:12,251 --> 00:32:16,449
- Then shall I work on him? -
Shut up.

106
00:32:16,556 --> 00:32:20,515
Since you said you don't love
him, why get so angry?

107
00:32:31,771 --> 00:32:36,004
Aren't you ashamed of
throwing yourself at everyone?

108
00:32:36,108 --> 00:32:43,538
My salary leaves me with 40
rupees after expenses.

109
00:32:43,649 --> 00:32:48,610
Can my mother, sister and I
live just on that?

110
00:32:48,721 --> 00:32:59,223
But I am not a whore. A smile
here helps the shop; outside, helps me!

111
00:33:01,801 --> 00:33:04,827
I've finished your book.
- So fast? How was it?

112
00:33:04,937 --> 00:33:08,100
Not nice at all.

113
00:33:29,829 --> 00:33:33,265
- Who do you need? -1 am
Chitra's brother here.

114
00:33:33,499 --> 00:33:43,466
Greetings. I am the manager.
Still single. What do you need?

115
00:33:43,576 --> 00:33:48,946
- Can you call her to the
phone? - She doesn't come anymore.

116
00:33:49,348 --> 00:33:56,812
- Don't you know? - I was
outstation for 10 days. Just returned.

117
00:33:56,989 --> 00:34:01,187
I saw your company's card at
home. So..

118
00:34:01,327 --> 00:34:07,790
She worked for 10 days. Then
she suddenly stoppped coming.

119
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:14,272
She didn't write in or call us.

120
00:34:14,373 --> 00:34:19,868
The neigbours said that she
hasn't been home for a week.

121
00:34:20,012 --> 00:34:27,817
We've replaced her here.
You'd better check with your relatives.

122
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:46,634
Who do you want? Sheela?
Sheela, call for you.

123
00:35:01,921 --> 00:35:11,421
I couldn't recognise your
voice.

124
00:35:18,938 --> 00:35:25,776
5 at the Gandhi Statute.
Wearing white with a red rose. Okay!

125
00:35:27,947 --> 00:35:33,750
I'll come there and talk.
Definately.

126
00:35:44,964 --> 00:35:53,031
I'm heading out. Don't ask
why. You must come over tomorrow.

127
00:37:09,048 --> 00:37:15,545
Did you call? You're not even
the height of my shoes. Yet this?

128
00:37:15,654 --> 00:37:20,353
Yes.

129
00:37:23,062 --> 00:37:26,259
Then who might have called?

130
00:38:00,099 --> 00:38:04,195
No more ice cream for the day.

131
00:38:34,133 --> 00:38:40,937
- Take care of that. - You seem
to have extra work with Sheela absent.

132
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:46,638
The work is not tough. It is
just boring without her around.

133
00:38:46,745 --> 00:38:53,242
- Wonder why she's missing. -
She didn't tell you either?

134
00:38:53,352 --> 00:39:00,657
She left after a call and told
me to drop by her house for her birthday.

135
00:39:00,759 --> 00:39:05,526
1 will drop by on her before I
go home.

136
00:41:36,315 --> 00:41:43,984
Are you injured? It's
dangerous to walk alone and be careless.

137
00:41:44,123 --> 00:41:48,458
Come get into the car.

138
00:42:08,347 --> 00:42:12,306
- Where must you go?
- Mount Road. Women's hostel.

139
00:42:12,484 --> 00:42:19,151
Why were you here then?
- I was coming to my friend's place.

140
00:42:19,258 --> 00:42:23,126
- So to your friend's house or
the hostel? - I'll go to the hostel.

141
00:42:23,228 --> 00:42:27,927
-1 can drop you at your
friend's house. - No, I'll go to the hostel.

142
00:42:28,067 --> 00:42:32,971
Staying in a hostel suggests
that you're not a native of this place.

143
00:42:33,072 --> 00:42:38,238
I'm from Kumbakonam.
Father's dead. Only mother is around.

144
00:42:38,343 --> 00:42:43,713
She's staying with my uncle.

145
00:42:54,393 --> 00:43:02,892
Sitting and not talking to the
driver at night can lead to accidents.

146
00:43:05,404 --> 00:43:10,001
- What should I say? - Fine,
I'll talk. Just answer my questions.

147
00:43:12,411 --> 00:43:18,612
- Do you think badly of me as
I come to the shop often?- Nothing like that.

148
00:43:18,717 --> 00:43:25,521
- About me coming to your
section often? - Nothing about that.

149
00:43:25,624 --> 00:43:32,963
- Me handing out gifts to you
whom I don't know? - Nothing about that.

150
00:43:33,065 --> 00:43:38,162
- If I say I love you now, will
you misunderstand me?- Nothing..

151
00:44:27,486 --> 00:44:31,923
She displays a flash of light in
her eyes; oh dear beautiful one!

152
00:44:32,991 --> 00:44:38,987
The bird of the love domain
seeks a relationship of joy!

153
00:44:40,499 --> 00:44:42,399
Heaven would be you.

154
00:44:42,534 --> 00:44:48,906
This girl displays a flash of
light in her eyes; oh dearest lord!

155
00:44:49,508 --> 00:44:55,936
The bird of the love domain
seeks a relationship of joy!

156
00:44:56,048 --> 00:45:00,212
Heaven is on my hands.

157
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:04,187
This girl displays a flash of
light.

158
00:45:11,463 --> 00:45:15,525
- Shall we go for a movie?
- No, the warden would be in.

159
00:45:15,667 --> 00:45:21,071
- How can I bring her too?
- No. She'll scold if we're late.

160
00:45:21,173 --> 00:45:29,206
-When then? - Sunday.
- Your warden won't object to this.

161
00:45:29,348 --> 00:45:33,182
Are you bringing the warden
with you?

162
00:46:02,581 --> 00:46:09,214
The joy of this young girl is
the places her lord takes her too.

163
00:46:09,321 --> 00:46:15,658
This ocean of joy is a place
where many rivers unite.

164
00:46:15,761 --> 00:46:20,062
My body is a dedication to
you.

165
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:25,537
Why do you need this rush
for?

166
00:46:37,616 --> 00:46:43,248
- Did you like the movie?
- No, it was too much of sex.

167
00:46:43,422 --> 00:46:48,087
- When is Vaikunda Ekathesi?
- Next month. Why?

168
00:46:48,193 --> 00:46:53,290
No,that's when they'll play
devotional films. I can bring you for that.

169
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:05,235
Did you tell your folks? Find
another vehicle to go to heaven!

170
00:47:10,649 --> 00:47:14,210
I forgot to tell you. I had a
wonderful dream yesterday. - What dream?

171
00:47:15,654 --> 00:47:22,856
We were both in a car going
through a quiet street like this.

172
00:47:22,961 --> 00:47:28,695
- Suddenly I stop. - And?
- 1 Kiss you for the 1st time. - Fat hope.

173
00:47:33,672 --> 00:47:37,438
- Why stop the car? - This is a
quiet street. - So?

174
00:47:37,542 --> 00:47:42,776
I am going to make my dream
come true.

175
00:47:42,881 --> 00:47:49,150
Don't! Please. You're terrible.

176
00:47:52,691 --> 00:47:57,288
- Who did you refer to?
- Us? Is this a saree shop or an asylum?

177
00:48:02,367 --> 00:48:08,500
She displays a flash of light in
her eyes; oh dear beautiful one!

178
00:48:08,607 --> 00:48:14,205
The bird of the love domain
seeks a relationship of joy!

179
00:48:14,312 --> 00:48:18,010
Heaven is on my hands!

180
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:23,180
She displays a flash of light in
her eyes!

181
00:48:56,822 --> 00:49:02,261
The garden has many flowers
but you are my red rose.

182
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:08,857
1 always gave myself to you,
my dearest lord!

183
00:49:08,967 --> 00:49:14,565
Dear flower, I yearn to pluck
you!

184
00:49:14,673 --> 00:49:21,101
And hence I await by your
side!

185
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:29,449
This girl displays a flash of
light in her eyes oh my dearest Lord!

186
00:49:29,521 --> 00:49:35,756
The bird of the love domain
seeks a relationship of joy!

187
00:49:35,827 --> 00:49:39,024
Heaven is in your hands!

188
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:44,125
This girl displays a flash of
light in her eyes!

189
00:50:16,201 --> 00:50:22,607
You're normally very lively
but you're so glum today.

190
00:50:22,707 --> 00:50:29,443
If you engage in an activity
without experiance would it turn out well?

191
00:50:29,548 --> 00:50:36,477
It's very hard. You always
need previous experiance to prevent harm.

192
00:50:36,855 --> 00:50:41,725
- So to the beach or
Mahabalipuram? - Why?

193
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:48,926
We're going to be married
next month. Without experiance, it's tough.

194
00:50:49,034 --> 00:50:53,528
-1 don't get it. - Don't you get
it?

195
00:50:58,376 --> 00:51:02,904
You're terrible. Don't you
have other conversation topics at all?

196
00:51:07,886 --> 00:51:13,586
You watch adult movies and
read English novel. Yet no interest in sex?

197
00:51:13,692 --> 00:51:18,289
There is alot.

198
00:51:18,396 --> 00:51:25,098
You'd asked me to check if the
stocks were available for export.

199
00:51:28,907 --> 00:51:36,177
- You, the boss, laughed.
- Now, the boss wants you to get out.

200
00:53:14,012 --> 00:53:19,610
- Must we go? Okay. Is this
outfit okay? - Yes.

201
00:53:56,054 --> 00:53:58,523
There is a statue inside.

202
00:54:03,361 --> 00:54:07,229
This temple is believed to be
powerful. So it is always crowded.

203
00:54:09,067 --> 00:54:14,437
- What did you pray for? -
Nothing. I came here for you.

204
00:54:14,539 --> 00:54:22,572
- Are you an atheist? -1
believe for an exam you should study not pray.

205
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:28,084
Is it wrong to pray to the force
that is greater than us?

206
00:54:28,219 --> 00:54:32,087
But the temple chariots don't
run on their own! We still have to pull them!

207
00:54:32,223 --> 00:54:38,253
Prayer is a social norm. I
don't reject it. I respect it.

208
00:54:48,106 --> 00:54:54,239
Shall we buy a Durga statue?
Do you like that one?

209
00:54:54,345 --> 00:54:58,475
-If you do. -1 do.
- What is the price of that statue?

210
00:54:58,583 --> 00:55:03,749
- 18 rupees. - This seems very
cheap; why not buy something more expensive?

211
00:55:05,123 --> 00:55:09,856
Give me that.

212
00:55:19,137 --> 00:55:26,373
Till now it was nagging about
marriage. The next will be about kids is it?

213
00:55:27,145 --> 00:55:34,848
There is no rush! Only you! -
In this matter of kids, everyone is a criminal.

214
00:55:34,953 --> 00:55:41,655
- Why do you say so? - They
use the bed for their own pleasures.

215
00:55:41,759 --> 00:55:48,062
When the child is born, they
act as if they had fasted for that child!

216
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:53,297
Why are you always so
cynical?

217
00:55:53,404 --> 00:56:01,403
Not all. Only with regards to
ladies' and sex. I've seen alot in these areas.

218
00:56:01,512 --> 00:56:09,476
You said you hadn't loved or
had relations. What do you mean now?

219
00:56:09,587 --> 00:56:15,583
Do you need experiance to tell
you what happens if you jump from a high floor?

220
00:56:16,194 --> 00:56:21,963
You made me fall in love by
speaking. Can I compete with that?

221
00:56:22,066 --> 00:56:30,668
I prefer competition at night.
That white building is my..sorry, our house.

222
00:56:34,212 --> 00:56:40,447
He is our watchman. I've
changed the gate twice but not him.

223
00:56:40,551 --> 00:56:48,925
No movements are missed by
him. Your Madam.

224
00:57:03,241 --> 00:57:11,046
He is our gardener. Like the
watchman too. He appreciates art alot.

225
00:57:11,149 --> 00:57:16,280
The evidence for that is my
garden. He specialises in the red roses.

226
00:57:16,387 --> 00:57:21,484
Your Madam.

227
00:57:41,279 --> 00:57:47,377
He is my cook. His name is..
Shantha moorthy.

228
00:58:00,298 --> 00:58:05,361
He's a great cook. He caused
me 200 rupees in doctor's fees with his food.

229
00:58:06,304 --> 00:58:11,868
- Well, I am here now. - Yes,
let me keep the doctor at home then!

230
00:58:30,161 --> 00:58:38,728
Why have you stopped?

231
00:58:38,836 --> 00:58:44,934
- Isn't there a servant girl
here? - Why?

232
00:58:45,043 --> 00:58:52,006
I asked because it was my first
time entering the house.

233
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:58,817
1 forgot that you're the
sentimental sort.

234
00:58:58,923 --> 00:59:06,193
My mother is not around to
invite you in the traditional manner.

235
00:59:06,297 --> 00:59:11,565
My father loved my mother
alot. Since then, I've had no other mother.

236
00:59:11,669 --> 00:59:18,507
Think of your favourite god,
Durga. Come in with your right foot.

237
00:59:28,886 --> 00:59:33,346
Angry?

238
00:59:33,891 --> 00:59:41,025
You seem to like red alot.
- Yes, that's why I chose a red saree too.

239
00:59:51,909 --> 00:59:56,073
- Scared? - Is that alive?
- Check it for yourself.

240
00:59:56,914 --> 01:00:01,977
It's not alive. There's alot
around. Don't be scared.

241
01:00:04,422 --> 01:00:12,421
This is the dining table. I don't
think I ever ate here for lack of company.

242
01:00:12,563 --> 01:00:15,760
Everything is in the bedroom.
I am a lonely man.

243
01:00:20,605 --> 01:00:25,668
This is your father-in- law.

244
01:00:31,449 --> 01:00:35,750
- That little boy is caught
today. - Caught by whom?

245
01:00:35,887 --> 01:00:43,021
A beautiful girl, named
Sarada.

246
01:00:43,127 --> 01:00:48,657
- You looked very cute then.
-So do ll look ugly now?

247
01:00:54,372 --> 01:00:58,639
In such a big house,..

248
01:01:02,146 --> 01:01:08,552
- Go on. - The house would be
alot livelier with more servants inside.

249
01:01:11,322 --> 01:01:14,952
- I thought like that till now. I
beg to differ now. - Why?

250
01:01:15,059 --> 01:01:23,661
- My full time job is increasing
the population. - No, you must work. I'll come.

251
01:01:23,768 --> 01:01:28,137
Then I'll ask them to put a
double bed into my room.

252
01:01:29,507 --> 01:01:34,069
- Is the bed all you think off?
- Fine I'll focus on the sofa.

253
01:01:38,849 --> 01:01:43,753
- We're going to the bedroom.
- No, I want to see all the rooms first.

254
01:01:43,854 --> 01:01:49,657
Then our first night will be
tomorrow morning.

255
01:01:51,529 --> 01:01:55,488
This is my reading room cum
library.

256
01:02:00,538 --> 01:02:04,566
- You read so much? - Yes, but
I don't need these anymore. - Why?

257
01:02:04,675 --> 01:02:10,444
These are just the theory
element. I now will get the practical element.

258
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:17,511
- All those kind of books?
- Not all but most.

259
01:02:21,559 --> 01:02:30,559
- Games room. - You only
have one chair for multiplayer games.

260
01:02:34,572 --> 01:02:40,067
-1 play with myself. - Alone?
- Yes, so that I can keep winning.

261
01:02:40,177 --> 01:02:44,876
I don't like meeting defeats.

262
01:02:45,049 --> 01:02:49,384
Then today, you will meet
your first defeat.

263
01:02:50,588 --> 01:02:55,549
I ususally win all the games in
the hostel. I will play and make you lose.

264
01:03:03,601 --> 01:03:07,299
You will only understand my
game at night.

265
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:18,076
This is another door to that
room. - What room is this one?

266
01:03:18,182 --> 01:03:23,848
There old records my father
used to use. No one uses it anymore.

267
01:03:28,626 --> 01:03:32,790
Let me introduce you to
another of this house.

268
01:03:34,632 --> 01:03:40,366
- Another of my true worker
cum friend. - Will it bite?

269
01:03:40,471 --> 01:03:44,408
Sometimes, even me too.

270
01:03:50,648 --> 01:03:54,107
That is the outhouse for this
place.

271
01:03:58,656 --> 01:04:04,493
The father -in-law in the photo
stays in that house.

272
01:04:04,595 --> 01:04:13,162
He lost his sanity after being
wrongly convicted and he lives imprisoned.

273
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:20,404
I can't control him. Only the
garderner can control him.

274
01:04:20,511 --> 01:04:25,745
It's been a long time since I
saw him.

275
01:04:26,183 --> 01:04:30,711
The fate of people can't be
changed by worrying.

276
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:52,075
I've already got the license for
this.

277
01:05:13,731 --> 01:05:19,693
I will come immediately.

278
01:05:27,745 --> 01:05:33,115
- My managing partners want
to see me. - Must you go?

279
01:05:34,752 --> 01:05:38,711
I'll be back soon.

280
01:06:27,805 --> 01:06:34,802
- Ganesh get it.
-What do we do now?

281
01:06:39,316 --> 01:06:43,844
- Give us the ball.

282
01:06:48,826 --> 01:06:55,857
- She looks new. - Ask her.
- Who are you? Are you hew here?

283
01:06:59,336 --> 01:07:06,675
There was another auntie
here. She took our ball and refused to give.

284
01:07:07,845 --> 01:07:12,282
- We fought and took it.
- How did she look like?

285
01:07:12,383 --> 01:07:14,909
Like a demon.

286
01:07:24,862 --> 01:07:29,823
He said there isn't even a
servant here. Who could it be?

287
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:36,337
- We need to answer
responsibly. - Yes. Chitra stopped working.

288
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:39,967
When I said this, the guy
insisted on meeting you. How?

289
01:07:41,879 --> 01:07:45,110
Send him in. I will talk to him.

290
01:08:04,902 --> 01:08:09,533
- I'm Chitra's brother. - I
know. - I am a sales representative.

291
01:08:13,911 --> 01:08:19,782
- She said you were a pilot
officer. - My sister seeks false pride.

292
01:08:19,883 --> 01:08:27,017
- She has many boyfriends.
- It's not her fault. Society is changing such.

293
01:08:27,124 --> 01:08:36,659
She's missing for a week. She
was here on the day she disappeared till night.

294
01:08:40,938 --> 01:08:48,402
- So she vanished after work?
- Yes, she had dinner that evening with one.

295
01:08:49,947 --> 01:08:55,943
- That boyfriend? - I don't
know who he is. I heard from the waiter.

296
01:08:56,086 --> 01:09:04,016
- Waiter? - He's here with me.
Her companion could be one of the staff.

297
01:09:07,965 --> 01:09:12,129
I hope you have no objection
with me showing him your staff.

298
01:09:19,977 --> 01:09:28,078
Chitra's brother wants to meet
the staff. Help him.

299
01:09:35,993 --> 01:09:42,695
Look at him. He is always at
the bus stop where there are college girls.

300
01:09:45,002 --> 01:09:51,601
This one goes directly to the
college itself.

301
01:09:58,015 --> 01:10:03,920
You can't seem him in any
hotel as he owes all of them money.

302
01:10:20,037 --> 01:10:24,838
- Anyone here? - No one here
is like the guy I saw at the hotel.

303
01:10:31,048 --> 01:10:36,111
- Checked? - He said that it is
none of your staff.

304
01:10:39,523 --> 01:10:44,518
I am very sorry for your state.

305
01:13:07,204 --> 01:13:13,268
- Scared?- Saffron should not
spill. Especially when I was putting it on.

306
01:13:13,377 --> 01:13:18,474
You're sentimental again.
What have you done with this room?

307
01:13:18,582 --> 01:13:23,577
You have such a huge house
but you lack a prayer room!

308
01:13:23,687 --> 01:13:27,920
But now you have set it up!
Hang up pictures and it will be perfect.

309
01:13:28,025 --> 01:13:34,192
Now, everyday you must bathe
and get ready ..

310
01:13:35,232 --> 01:13:40,796
Get up! You mustn't wear
your shoes inside here!

311
01:13:40,904 --> 01:13:47,901
- You sound like an auntie.
- "There was another auntie here."

312
01:13:48,045 --> 01:13:53,575
"She took our ball and refused
to give it to us."

313
01:14:20,110 --> 01:14:22,704
I need to ask you something.
- Ask.

314
01:14:22,813 --> 01:14:26,272
Apparently there was an
"auntie" here before me. Who was it?

315
01:14:26,416 --> 01:14:30,284
- Who told you? - The kids
from next door.

316
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:36,120
Why did they come here?

317
01:14:36,626 --> 01:14:44,158
Nothing. Their ball..

318
01:14:48,305 --> 01:14:52,742
You had rushed to the office.
What was it about?

319
01:14:55,312 --> 01:14:59,613
You looked upset on the phone
itself. Tell me what it is.

320
01:15:02,319 --> 01:15:08,725
- Tell me. - Nothing.
- You're hiding something from me. Tell.

321
01:15:08,825 --> 01:15:14,457
I am your wife..

322
01:15:58,375 --> 01:16:03,472
The meeting today was not
easy. So.. - It's alright.

323
01:16:06,383 --> 01:16:12,846
- It's our first day of marriage.
- You look tired. I will get you tea.

324
01:16:18,728 --> 01:16:23,029
- I need to go out urgently.
- Okay, what food would you like?

325
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:31,267
No, you must tell me what you
like.

326
01:16:37,414 --> 01:16:45,652
You're my meal today.
Angry? Promise?

327
01:16:54,064 --> 01:16:57,898
I'll go out and return.

328
01:21:33,042 --> 01:21:38,606
Then I'll ask them to put a
double bed there - Is that all you think of?

329
01:21:38,715 --> 01:21:42,413
Fine ll shall focus on the sofa
then.

330
01:21:45,522 --> 01:21:50,426
Fine let's go straight to the
bedroom.

331
01:22:02,739 --> 01:22:12,114
Thoughts are a bird that
spreads out its wings.

332
01:22:12,248 --> 01:22:18,051
It will fly and begin its
relationship!

333
01:22:19,088 --> 01:22:27,519
Thoughts are a bird that
spreads out its wings.

334
01:22:28,631 --> 01:22:33,967
It will fly and begin its
relationship!

335
01:22:34,270 --> 01:22:40,403
Thoughts are a bird.

336
01:23:22,318 --> 01:23:31,989
The drops of scent on the roses
slide - honey like jewels.

337
01:23:37,834 --> 01:23:47,471
That is the honey that is rare -
why have you yet to consume it?

338
01:23:48,177 --> 01:23:53,672
It is for that I am so excited.

339
01:23:53,783 --> 01:23:58,584
I came. I came to give.

340
01:23:58,688 --> 01:24:07,688
Thoughts are a bird that
spreads out its wings.

341
01:24:08,865 --> 01:24:14,668
It will fly and begin its
relationship!

342
01:24:14,771 --> 01:24:19,971
Thoughts are a bird.

343
01:25:02,418 --> 01:25:11,350
When I shiver in winter,
would your gaze be my cover?

344
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:26,873
I am shivering without an
embrace - hence ll lie on your lap

345
01:25:26,976 --> 01:25:32,278
Is my lap your personal
swing?

346
01:25:33,416 --> 01:25:38,547
You are, from how me.

347
01:25:39,255 --> 01:25:48,255
Thoughts are a bird that
spreads out its wings.

348
01:25:48,431 --> 01:25:54,165
It will fly and begin its
relationship!

349
01:25:54,270 --> 01:26:03,111
Thoughts are a bird that
spreads out its wings.

350
01:26:03,279 --> 01:26:09,446
It will fly and begin its
relationship!

351
01:26:09,552 --> 01:26:15,218
Thoughts are a bird.

352
01:29:56,712 --> 01:30:00,114
Looks like the water pipe is
leaking.

353
01:32:39,608 --> 01:32:48,813
The scratches on my young
heart still throb as thorns in my heart.

354
01:32:48,918 --> 01:32:54,448
They act as my mirror and
reflect the harshness on me.

355
01:32:54,557 --> 01:33:01,588
My thoughts, again and
again, again and again, ..

356
01:33:19,548 --> 01:33:25,248
Your animal has wreaked
havoc! It got tied up! Your auntie's after you!

357
01:33:40,836 --> 01:33:45,535
- Catch him! - Arrogant
fellow! - Leave me! Let me go!

358
01:33:47,576 --> 01:33:55,506
Stop! You orphan! You've
made the cow bleed to death!

359
01:33:55,618 --> 01:34:00,249
You can't look after the
cow well! What do you want then?!

360
01:34:00,389 --> 01:34:07,193
Wait! Your mother left you
and went! I've to put up with this!

361
01:34:07,296 --> 01:34:13,065
Don't hit me! - Useless
fellow!

362
01:34:13,335 --> 01:34:18,705
Running away? Go! Go to
hell! Don't come back home for food!

363
01:34:25,614 --> 01:34:31,883
- He said he hasn't eaten
for 3 days. - Eat slowly. Don't rush.

364
01:34:31,987 --> 01:34:40,589
- Don't choke. - Why not
we feed him and let him help us out?

365
01:34:40,763 --> 01:34:44,859
Okay, let him stay. I have
no objections.

366
01:34:44,967 --> 01:34:50,997
- I'm late. Father I'm
leaving. - Go carefully.

367
01:34:51,106 --> 01:34:56,772
Here wash your hands.

368
01:35:17,666 --> 01:35:22,661
I'm going to temple. When
Pankajam comes tell her to make coffee.

369
01:35:22,805 --> 01:35:29,541
I'll be back before 7. Look
after the house. It's a new pail. Careful.

370
01:35:29,645 --> 01:35:34,139
You're always careless.

371
01:35:41,690 --> 01:35:46,560
Mother asked you to make
coffee and drink when you come back.

372
01:35:48,697 --> 01:35:57,230
- Where's she? - Temple.
- Where did you say? - Temple.

373
01:37:18,787 --> 01:37:21,984
- When will mother come?
- She said she'll come before 7.

374
01:37:22,091 --> 01:37:25,925
Can you help to take the
sugar container for me?

375
01:37:42,644 --> 01:37:50,017
- What is it? - Can you
hook the blouse for me?

376
01:38:08,837 --> 01:38:16,574
- Leave me! - The boy is
good but not too sure about the rest.

377
01:38:20,849 --> 01:38:32,022
Leave me! Look at what he
did! You treated him as your own son!

378
01:38:32,127 --> 01:38:39,966
When no one was around,
he held my hand and ..

379
01:38:41,370 --> 01:38:46,365
What will I do? I don't
understand anything!

380
01:38:46,475 --> 01:38:51,845
My body is shivering!

381
01:38:54,883 --> 01:38:58,683
Is this what you do in
return for us feeding you?

382
01:38:58,787 --> 01:39:05,853
- How could you? - I
thought of you as a son! Scum!

383
01:39:06,028 --> 01:39:12,365
- No! - If I'd known you
were such, I wouldn't have let you in!

384
01:39:12,568 --> 01:39:22,444
- Don't hit! - Get out! - We
should kill you for this! How dare you?!

385
01:39:53,942 --> 01:39:59,904
Let me in! I haven't eaten
in 4 days! Please!

386
01:40:00,082 --> 01:40:03,177
He looks like a poor thing!
Let him in!

387
01:40:07,956 --> 01:40:11,415
Let him in!

388
01:40:13,962 --> 01:40:21,028
- What is it? - I've not
eaten for 4 days. Give me the biscuit.

389
01:40:21,136 --> 01:40:28,065
- I will work for it. - We
will deal with that later. You eat first.

390
01:40:34,883 --> 01:40:40,652
- Doesn't he seem pitiful?
- Yes. He seems like a good kid too.

391
01:40:40,789 --> 01:40:44,953
Let him stay here and eat
and go!

392
01:40:50,999 --> 01:40:56,460
- You will be back soon? -
I'll finish the work in 4 days.

393
01:40:56,572 --> 01:41:00,736
Eat regularly. Your
medicines are there. Take care.

394
01:41:00,842 --> 01:41:06,940
- Why keep repeating it?
- You never remember. What can I do?

395
01:41:07,149 --> 01:41:16,217
It's a habit. Madam is
scared to be alone. Stay with her at home.

396
01:41:16,325 --> 01:41:21,286
Look after the house! I will
go to the airport with him and come. Bag.

397
01:41:21,396 --> 01:41:25,856
- It's okay. - Just give it!
- It's getting late. Come.

398
01:41:42,050 --> 01:41:47,955
Did you call me mother?
Do I look like one to you?

399
01:41:48,190 --> 01:41:51,956
Call me sister.

400
01:42:37,105 --> 01:42:44,034
Madam is scared to be
alone. Stay with her at home.

401
01:43:30,492 --> 01:43:35,123
Bring my bag in.

402
01:43:49,177 --> 01:43:53,876
- What is that sound?
- Madam..

403
01:43:53,982 --> 01:43:58,215
- She's very bad.
- What are you saying?

404
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:03,224
Madam is with someone in
the room ..

405
01:44:34,222 --> 01:44:38,921
Don't do anything to me!

406
01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:08,678
Kill them! All this women
are like this! Devils! Demons!

407
01:45:08,790 --> 01:45:11,725
Stab her!

408
01:45:26,274 --> 01:45:31,371
You are like a son to me
who is childless! I will bring you up right!

409
01:45:38,053 --> 01:45:43,389
When I have no child, I
will bring you up the right way!

410
01:45:49,297 --> 01:45:55,600
That is how I grew up!
Your sixth victim was Sheela!

411
01:46:11,987 --> 01:46:17,721
Only tonight will you
understand my game!

412
01:46:21,329 --> 01:46:23,297
You're my meal tonight.

413
01:51:28,636 --> 01:51:33,870
That girl Chitra the other
day,..

414
01:51:35,143 --> 01:51:40,013
- What's this? - For you to
not talk. - For me to not talk?

415
01:51:40,114 --> 01:51:45,553
Is that so? How many
months?

416
01:51:49,657 --> 01:51:54,094
Did you murder her?

417
01:51:54,195 --> 01:51:59,861
- Take this. - Wait. This is
a big issue - not just for eating or something.

418
01:52:04,672 --> 01:52:09,633
- What do you want? - This
is fair. I've always had a desire.

419
01:52:09,811 --> 01:52:15,648
An outlet with an AC room
and 10 employees where I am the owner.

420
01:52:16,184 --> 01:52:21,281
I can get a bank loan but
it's easier to get it from you. 50,000.

421
01:52:25,693 --> 01:52:30,563
Fine leave it then.
- Look, 20000.

422
01:52:30,665 --> 01:52:37,162
- Not 50 then. 40735?
- 25,

423
01:54:59,781 --> 01:55:03,979
- 1 was a little late.
- Not just a little but very late.

424
01:55:04,085 --> 01:55:10,320
I entered the no entry zone
and the police stopped me. I'll park and come.

425
01:56:06,914 --> 01:56:12,148
That girl you brought has
seen everything! She's seen it all!

426
01:56:15,923 --> 01:56:21,384
What were you doing?

427
02:04:42,997 --> 02:04:47,491
Dilip is in the hospital.
They suspect he has a mental disorder.

428
02:04:47,601 --> 02:04:52,129
- Isn't the case peculiar?
- This is due to childhood incidents.

429
02:04:52,239 --> 02:04:58,110
Can you imagine how
frustrated he must be?

430
02:04:58,245 --> 02:05:04,776
He killed each person;
buried them and planted a rose plant.

431
02:05:04,918 --> 02:05:10,482
In the morning, he takes
the rose flower and puts it in his pocket.

432
02:05:10,591 --> 02:05:15,893
- It's interesting. - But I
wouldn't say that he alone is responsible.

433
02:05:15,996 --> 02:05:19,796
Society too is responsible.
Ignorance of law cannot be excused.

434
02:05:19,933 --> 02:05:27,101
Similarly in Bombay, 15
years ago, they'd arrested a guy Raman.

435
02:05:27,207 --> 02:05:32,475
He too had been affected
by a childhood incident and ended up such.

436
02:05:32,646 --> 02:05:37,208
But circumstances do not
change the fact that a crime is a crime.

437
02:05:38,485 --> 02:05:44,686
You can't converse with
him because he doesn't understand us.

438
02:05:44,792 --> 02:05:47,955
He's beyond all of that.
Come let us have a look.

439
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:18,515
Today is October 12th.
Your birthday.

440
02:06:22,196 --> 02:06:27,794
- Take it.
- Take it!

441
02:06:39,079 --> 02:06:43,880
Say that you're leaving.
This place is jail.

442
02:06:44,017 --> 02:06:47,578
I'll be back. For my next
birthday.

443
02:06:52,559 --> 02:06:57,827
I didn't expect you to
continue to have such deep attachment.

444
02:06:59,566 --> 02:07:04,197
Why not change your
mind?

445
02:07:04,271 --> 02:07:08,401
You can come to another
decision.

446
02:07:08,509 --> 02:07:18,715
1 believe in God. I prayed
that this nupital remains on me forever.

447
02:07:20,587 --> 02:07:23,056
Come let's go.

448
02:08:21,148 --> 02:08:24,118
"Saratha, my wife."
