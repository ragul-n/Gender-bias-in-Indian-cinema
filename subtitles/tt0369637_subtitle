1
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,092
Kuch Naa Kaho
(Say no more)

2
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:56,231
"Your brother's bank has received
your cash gift, Doctor"

3
00:00:56,503 --> 00:00:58,437
It's already reached Mumbai

4
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,240
You've made it so simple.

5
00:01:03,443 --> 00:01:06,105
That's Western Union Money
Transfer for you.

6
00:01:06,947 --> 00:01:08,938
Give Rakesh this phone number

7
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:12,446
All he needs is his ID card
to draw cash from any of our branches

8
00:01:14,855 --> 00:01:19,792
I'm sorry that my wife's surgery...
is keeping you from Mumbai

9
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,451
What matters is that
my gift has reached them

10
00:01:25,732 --> 00:01:28,064
What do you mean

11
00:01:28,602 --> 00:01:31,070
You've sent a gift
but you're not coming?

12
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:34,206
"Rakesh, I have an urgent surgery"

13
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:38,475
I'll miss Nikki's engagement
but I'll be at the wedding for sure

14
00:01:38,678 --> 00:01:40,669
At least send Raj

15
00:01:40,914 --> 00:01:45,044
"Puja, Nikki, and
Aria are dying to see him"

16
00:01:45,485 --> 00:01:47,885
"After all, he's the only brother
they have."

17
00:01:48,088 --> 00:01:51,819
Raj is impossible.
He doesn't listen

18
00:01:53,026 --> 00:01:56,894
"If his Dad was alive,
he'd have set him right"

19
00:01:57,664 --> 00:02:02,158
"Didi, just send him to India..."

20
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:06,505
I'll line up such eligible beauties
that he will return a married man

21
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:09,168
"But Raj must agree, right?"

22
00:02:09,643 --> 00:02:13,101
Now only his future wife will
be able to set him right

23
00:02:13,513 --> 00:02:18,246
But I don't even know if there is
a woman for him out there

24
00:02:18,518 --> 00:02:20,315
"And if there is, where is she?"

25
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,617
Your Uncle called

26
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:41,293
He's upset that you're
missing the engagement

27
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,437
"It's take out,
from an Italian restaurant"

28
00:04:55,642 --> 00:04:59,373
"You know Mom,
I knew there's something wrong"

29
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:02,245
Son...

30
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:05,311
You know Nikki considers
you her only brother

31
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:08,918
She'll be really sad
if you don't go

32
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:17,653
It's also from the Italian place

33
00:05:23,003 --> 00:05:27,337
"You know mom, living on this food,
is driving me crazy..."

34
00:05:30,677 --> 00:05:34,670
This pizza's a perfect example

35
00:05:35,482 --> 00:05:39,009
It's not coming off the plate -
disgusting greasy stuff

36
00:05:40,854 --> 00:05:42,845
I made that

37
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:51,353
"Seriously, son.
Two of my patients need me here."

38
00:05:51,698 --> 00:05:54,360
One may require surgery...

39
00:05:54,768 --> 00:05:57,032
So I can't go to Nikki's engagement

40
00:05:57,404 --> 00:06:00,703
But you have no reason to skip it.
- I do mom...

41
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:05,509
"As soon as I land in Mumbai,
Uncle will line up girls, saying..."

42
00:06:05,712 --> 00:06:09,512
"Son, this one's an MA,
she's a BA, here's a Phd"

43
00:06:09,783 --> 00:06:11,512
Blah blah blah...

44
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:17,220
Like you

45
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:20,386
"Whether I like the food or not,
you make me eat it..."

46
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:25,391
Uncle's the same.
Whether I like the girl or not...

47
00:06:25,732 --> 00:06:27,529
he'll get me married

48
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:29,895
You'd rather be a bachelor
all your life?

49
00:06:31,738 --> 00:06:33,535
Bachelors live longer

50
00:06:33,873 --> 00:06:40,142
"Their days seem longer, that's all.
- Mom, I can't give up my freedom"

51
00:06:57,764 --> 00:07:00,096
Raj? This is Nikki

52
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:04,026
Papa says you're not coming
for my engagement?

53
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:07,529
The problem is...

54
00:07:09,576 --> 00:07:11,567
You're crying?
- No...

55
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:18,445
What's wrong?
- You know Papa listens to no one

56
00:07:22,255 --> 00:07:25,782
"If you don't come, who'll tell him
I don't want to get married?"

57
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:30,194
"Why, Nikki?"

58
00:07:31,231 --> 00:07:33,358
I don't love him

59
00:07:34,134 --> 00:07:39,401
Then why are you getting engaged?
- It's being forced on me

60
00:07:39,606 --> 00:07:41,403
What will you do?

61
00:07:42,075 --> 00:07:44,805
I'll watch them distribute
wedding cards

62
00:07:46,212 --> 00:07:47,201
Then?

63
00:07:47,547 --> 00:07:49,811
They'll dress me up
in wedding finery

64
00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:52,813
Then?
- They'll escort me to the altar

65
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,314
Then?
- I'll run away

66
00:07:57,824 --> 00:07:59,815
"No, Nikki! I'm coming!"

67
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:02,624
He's coming!

68
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:24,312
"Listen, Sister, it's crucial that
I get on this flight"

69
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:27,452
"Listen, Brother,
the last seat's gone."

70
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:30,183
My seat?

71
00:08:30,857 --> 00:08:33,655
To whom?
- That lady-on the phone

72
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:40,194
One minute

73
00:08:56,583 --> 00:09:00,451
You know what happens to me
when I'm away from you...

74
00:09:01,087 --> 00:09:02,645
"I'm missing you, my love"

75
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:05,057
You miss me too?

76
00:09:05,892 --> 00:09:07,120
No?

77
00:09:08,995 --> 00:09:11,657
Fine. I'll stay two more days

78
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,867
No... I'm on today's flight

79
00:09:18,304 --> 00:09:21,865
Yes?
- Can you help me?

80
00:09:24,577 --> 00:09:26,909
"Could I have your seat, please?"

81
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:42,928
I mean - your seat
on the Mumbai flight

82
00:09:45,064 --> 00:09:47,897
My son's in Mumbai. Babloo

83
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:52,298
"He's ill, very ill... seriously ill"

84
00:09:54,007 --> 00:09:55,907
What's wrong with him?

85
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:05,646
Heart attack

86
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:08,043
How old?
- Twenty-six

87
00:10:08,922 --> 00:10:10,719
And you?

88
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,657
Twenty-six

89
00:10:14,661 --> 00:10:16,652
"Father, son... both 26?"

90
00:10:17,397 --> 00:10:19,388
You asked about Babloo?

91
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:25,928
"If I'm 26, how old would he be?"

92
00:10:27,941 --> 00:10:30,205
Three or four.
- Exactly. Three or four.

93
00:10:30,944 --> 00:10:33,538
Such a small boy had
a heart attack?

94
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:37,940
"You're not a doctor, are you?"

95
00:10:38,952 --> 00:10:43,514
It's a very rare case.
Happens only to little kids

96
00:10:44,223 --> 00:10:47,750
Hypo-cardio-pulmon-oritisis syndrome

97
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:54,690
He's got a hole in his heart

98
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:57,967
"High fever, low BP..."

99
00:11:01,908 --> 00:11:04,775
"Imagine, such a small child..."

100
00:11:06,045 --> 00:11:12,644
"I'm here on urgent work and
he's there, calling out,"

101
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:13,774
"Papa, Papa"

102
00:11:14,387 --> 00:11:18,153
He won't take his medicines
without me

103
00:11:19,892 --> 00:11:23,384
"Madam, I must get to Mumbai"

104
00:11:24,664 --> 00:11:27,656
I must give Babloo his medicine

105
00:11:29,002 --> 00:11:30,993
Only you can help me

106
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:37,604
Please take the next flight.
I can organize your stay here

107
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:39,000
No

108
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:58,622
No. I mean you don't need
to worry about me...

109
00:11:59,032 --> 00:12:04,026
I'll take the next flight.
It's important you go

110
00:12:05,038 --> 00:12:07,302
I know how you must feel

111
00:12:17,116 --> 00:12:20,643
Cancel my ticket.
- And confirm mine

112
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:24,383
Make it snappy... and...
a window seat

113
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:31,394
"Don't worry, he'll be all right
- Who?"

114
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:33,120
Babloo

115
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:35,659
Who Babloo?

116
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:39,761
Babloo... your son

117
00:12:40,073 --> 00:12:41,665
"Yes, Babloo"

118
00:12:44,477 --> 00:12:47,412
"With your blessings,
he'll be okay"

119
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:02,528
"Uncle, it's Raj. I'm coming.
Please be at the airport"

120
00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:24,908
May you live long

121
00:13:25,184 --> 00:13:26,913
May your married life be blissful

122
00:13:27,386 --> 00:13:31,254
"Uncle, I set foot in India
and you start"

123
00:13:31,457 --> 00:13:36,121
Worry about Nikki now.
- No need. Ajay's a fine boy

124
00:13:38,131 --> 00:13:41,100
Ajay?
- He's one in a million!

125
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:48,630
Ajay Sehgal?
- Right. One in a million.

126
00:13:50,143 --> 00:13:52,111
You know him?

127
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:03,922
"You don't mean Ajay Roshanlal Sehgal?
- Yes, so?"

128
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:06,525
Why? Is something wrong?

129
00:14:09,695 --> 00:14:13,961
Not Ajay Roshanlal Sehgal who
did his MBA from NYU?

130
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:17,498
"Yes, yes... Listen, Raj..."

131
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,796
My blood pressure's rising.
Tell me plainly...

132
00:14:21,174 --> 00:14:23,404
What is Ajay up to and with whom

133
00:14:25,244 --> 00:14:29,806
He likes someone in New York
- Likes someone?

134
00:14:30,183 --> 00:14:33,516
Who he's ditching to marry Nikki

135
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:38,317
What?
- Please forgive him

136
00:14:39,192 --> 00:14:40,284
Forgive him?

137
00:14:40,526 --> 00:14:45,156
"Uncle, you promised.
He's one in a million"

138
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:50,158
Are you sure?

139
00:14:52,271 --> 00:14:55,832
I heard it from the horse's mouth.
- Ajay told you?

140
00:14:56,209 --> 00:15:00,168
No. The broken-hearted one...

141
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:03,173
Why doesn't Ajay marry that one?

142
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:05,617
He wanted to

143
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:09,447
But couldn't hurt his parents

144
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:17,593
"He sacrificed his love for them
- Meaning, he still loves..."

145
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:21,189
"One in a million, right?"

146
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:25,594
So tell me- who is
my daughter's rival?

147
00:15:27,506 --> 00:15:28,803
Michael

148
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:32,200
Michael?
- Yes... Michael

149
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:36,875
"These Americans are strange.
In India, Michael is a boy's name"

150
00:15:39,218 --> 00:15:41,209
In America too.
- What?

151
00:15:41,654 --> 00:15:44,384
"Uncle, Michael is a guy"

152
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,558
Michael is a man...

153
00:15:51,464 --> 00:15:55,230
Big moustache and all.
- He can't marry my daughter.

154
00:15:55,568 --> 00:15:58,560
You promised.
- To hell with my promise

155
00:15:58,671 --> 00:16:00,229
There's no way I'll
allow this marriage

156
00:16:00,373 --> 00:16:04,036
But he's one in a million.
- Such guys are one in a million

157
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,039
Two.
- Shut up.

158
00:16:06,245 --> 00:16:07,234
Uncle...

159
00:16:10,349 --> 00:16:13,045
What's wrong with this dress?
- So cute

160
00:16:13,352 --> 00:16:17,482
"Very nice. Ajay, please,
I'm not interested"

161
00:16:17,857 --> 00:16:19,256
Nice outfit.

162
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:22,690
"Puja, what if Namrata doesn't
show up with her clothes?"

163
00:16:23,262 --> 00:16:27,255
You'll have to wear something.
- You look beautiful

164
00:16:27,433 --> 00:16:30,596
Thank you Aria.
- Superb!

165
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,931
"What style, what attitude..."

166
00:16:37,343 --> 00:16:40,278
You're dressed just right
- Exactly. But Nikki doesn't like it

167
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:42,276
"Didi, even Papa approves"

168
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:44,372
"Papa, tell her it's a lovely outfit."

169
00:16:50,289 --> 00:16:51,449
Come here

170
00:16:51,691 --> 00:16:54,626
Meet our sister's prince charming

171
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:56,918
He's no prince.
He's a queen

172
00:16:57,096 --> 00:16:59,997
Sorry?
- The wedding's off.

173
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:02,961
I don't understand.
- But I've understood

174
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:04,636
"What's the matter, Papa-ji?"

175
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:07,729
"Scoundrel. Calls me Papa
- Papa, what's come over you?"

176
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,035
"Nikki, one minute.
Relax, Uncle"

177
00:17:11,577 --> 00:17:18,710
"Raj, what are you up to?
- I've made sure you're free."

178
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,913
You're behind this.
- Of course.

179
00:17:23,322 --> 00:17:26,314
"Raj, I love Ajay"

180
00:17:27,493 --> 00:17:28,755
What?

181
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,331
"Pooja, dear... go inside."

182
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:37,325
What are you doing?

183
00:17:38,337 --> 00:17:40,328
You go too
- But...

184
00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:43,335
Take the clothes too. Take them

185
00:17:48,347 --> 00:17:53,148
You lied to me?
- How else could I get you here?

186
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:58,355
So I have to tell uncle...

187
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:01,956
I'm history

188
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,367
You made a fool of your Uncle!

189
00:18:12,471 --> 00:18:15,167
"Don't take it personally, Ajay"

190
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,172
Tomorrow's the engagement.
Do come

191
00:18:19,378 --> 00:18:21,073
Just a minute

192
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:26,048
Tell me- who loves Michael?

193
00:18:26,385 --> 00:18:27,579
No one

194
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:35,048
Nikki! You're not ready yet?

195
00:18:35,394 --> 00:18:38,795
Namrata was to bring my outfit

196
00:18:39,265 --> 00:18:42,928
"And the matching jewellery,
shoes, and everything"

197
00:18:43,402 --> 00:18:46,064
She's not here yet.
I told you...

198
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:48,399
not to send her to America
before my engagement

199
00:18:49,074 --> 00:18:51,065
She was expected yesterday

200
00:18:51,544 --> 00:18:54,638
Everyone's waiting.
Wear something else

201
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:59,417
Never. I'll wear only that outfit

202
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:02,187
So if she doesn't come
your engagement's off?

203
00:19:02,655 --> 00:19:06,091
"Raj, this is my elder brother
and my sister-in-law"

204
00:19:17,503 --> 00:19:19,994
"What's wrong, Raj?
- Nothing"

205
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,199
"If you'd come any later,
the engagement would've been off."

206
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:27,412
"Sorry, sir. I'd checked in and..."

207
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:30,946
Later! Get her ready quickly.
I'll attend to the guests

208
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:33,782
You're so late

209
00:19:37,456 --> 00:19:41,085
What happened to you?
- When I reached the airport...

210
00:19:41,393 --> 00:19:48,128
"Raj, meet the Malhotras...
and their daughter Rani"

211
00:19:57,476 --> 00:19:59,444
Talk to her.

212
00:20:02,481 --> 00:20:04,039
Say something

213
00:20:05,484 --> 00:20:08,146
Where do you stay?

214
00:20:08,654 --> 00:20:09,951
Nearby...

215
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:12,050
On MG Road...
- And you?

216
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:14,453
In a house.
I can't live on the road

217
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:23,535
He's always joking

218
00:20:25,371 --> 00:20:26,736
"Uncle, I'm serious"

219
00:20:41,987 --> 00:20:43,887
You?
- You?

220
00:20:45,491 --> 00:20:48,016
I can't believe it
- Nor can I

221
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:52,287
You know each other?
- I was telling you about the airport

222
00:20:57,503 --> 00:20:59,494
Namrata designed it

223
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:05,173
How is he? Babloo?

224
00:21:06,512 --> 00:21:09,913
Babloo? He's well.

225
00:21:12,518 --> 00:21:14,509
Which Babloo?

226
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:18,183
Ajay. He's been searching for you.

227
00:21:18,524 --> 00:21:20,253
Nikki's here

228
00:21:30,536 --> 00:21:32,333
Must be around. I'll fetch her

229
00:21:32,871 --> 00:21:33,860
One minute

230
00:21:33,973 --> 00:21:35,770
I can't find Nikki or Ajay.
Where are they?

231
00:21:35,874 --> 00:21:36,863
Right here

232
00:21:39,545 --> 00:21:42,537
"Namrata, it's a beautiful outfit."

233
00:21:42,948 --> 00:21:45,143
Have you met?

234
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:48,545
"The most talented designer
in our office, Namrata"

235
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:55,158
My nephew Raj. He lives in America
and thinks he's too cool to marry

236
00:21:55,794 --> 00:21:56,783
But he's...

237
00:21:56,895 --> 00:21:59,295
going to get married this time.
He won't escape

238
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:08,903
It's getting late

239
00:22:10,175 --> 00:22:11,574
Come along

240
00:22:12,578 --> 00:22:14,910
Do you know why I was delayed?

241
00:22:15,948 --> 00:22:22,581
This man had to rush back
to tend to his sick son Babloo

242
00:22:41,607 --> 00:22:44,269
"Look, I had to get to
Nikki's engagement..."

243
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:52,415
Admit that it was a good idea

244
00:22:58,624 --> 00:23:01,752
So you have no sense of humour?
It's not your fault

245
00:23:02,027 --> 00:23:04,018
Girls are deficient in that department

246
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:07,292
"Only guys are smart, right?"

247
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:10,227
"Nikki, you should stand by him"

248
00:23:10,703 --> 00:23:12,796
But Namrata was so late

249
00:23:13,105 --> 00:23:15,039
All because you

250
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,902
Don't listen to these guys.
They're all liars.

251
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:35,652
Come on... listen to me...

252
00:23:36,995 --> 00:23:39,657
What is it?

253
00:23:41,366 --> 00:23:47,464
"Listen carefully then
tell me what you think"

254
00:23:51,543 --> 00:23:59,541
"Why are women so arrogant,
vain and stuck up"

255
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:07,686
"We're just being nice to you,
so why the attitude?"

256
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:14,499
You listen to me...

257
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:17,925
What would you like to say?

258
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:21,339
We're not like that

259
00:24:21,473 --> 00:24:23,441
But even if we were

260
00:24:23,575 --> 00:24:25,509
So what?

261
00:24:27,446 --> 00:24:30,472
"Why shouldn't we be proud
or even arrogant"

262
00:24:30,983 --> 00:24:35,317
When we have the world at our feet

263
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:38,690
And our beauty drives you crazy

264
00:24:41,393 --> 00:24:46,353
Even when we break your hearts

265
00:24:46,832 --> 00:24:50,290
"You must admit we do it
with a certain charm"

266
00:24:53,138 --> 00:24:59,702
"We hope you got the answer
You were looking for..."

267
00:25:01,346 --> 00:25:04,281
Listen to me...

268
00:25:05,651 --> 00:25:08,711
"Let me tell you,
the secret of your beauty"

269
00:25:09,154 --> 00:25:11,884
And your charm?

270
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,987
"It is we who behold the magic
in your mundane acts"

271
00:25:19,431 --> 00:25:23,060
"And honor your silly tantrums
with attention"

272
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:29,230
"It is we who call your smallest
virtue sublime"

273
00:25:29,775 --> 00:25:34,075
"And make your ordinary
looks legendary"

274
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,749
Your beauty remains unmatched

275
00:25:38,116 --> 00:25:41,745
only in the eyes of the beholder

276
00:25:42,187 --> 00:25:45,748
"Without us,
where would you be?"

277
00:26:33,872 --> 00:26:38,969
If you think...

278
00:26:39,845 --> 00:26:43,474
That we owe our looks to you

279
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:47,148
then it's clear that

280
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,485
your beauty has you

281
00:26:51,823 --> 00:26:56,624
"so intoxicated
that you cannot think straight"

282
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,630
"Otherwise, why would you"

283
00:27:00,832 --> 00:27:03,062
Talk such rubbish?

284
00:27:31,964 --> 00:27:35,866
"Obviously you missed the point...
Nevermind"

285
00:27:36,301 --> 00:27:39,668
If you want to be vain that's fine

286
00:27:39,938 --> 00:27:42,338
But don't forget

287
00:27:44,176 --> 00:27:46,667
That the glow on your face

288
00:27:46,878 --> 00:27:49,676
"only reflects the fire
of our passions"

289
00:27:49,881 --> 00:27:53,214
for the world to see

290
00:27:53,952 --> 00:27:56,682
It's not surprising

291
00:27:56,888 --> 00:28:01,222
we've cast a spell on you

292
00:28:01,994 --> 00:28:04,690
"with our petal-soft skin
lips like buds"

293
00:28:04,896 --> 00:28:08,229
"and hair so dark and fragrant
like the night"

294
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:10,458
But we're the ones who

295
00:28:10,569 --> 00:28:13,561
"Compared your lips to buds
and your skin to blossoms"

296
00:28:13,905 --> 00:28:16,465
"It is we who respond to your
glance as if it's magical"

297
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:18,632
"and your words
as if they're poetry"

298
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:23,609
"And it's we who see the mystery
of the night in your hair"

299
00:28:23,949 --> 00:28:27,612
"If we were not to look at it
to love it and to worship it"

300
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,717
"Who would call an idol
made of stone"

301
00:28:30,922 --> 00:28:32,184
A god

302
00:28:36,995 --> 00:28:39,327
Will you listen to me?

303
00:28:40,932 --> 00:28:45,369
What's left to say?

304
00:28:46,938 --> 00:28:51,398
Come on... listen to me...

305
00:28:52,944 --> 00:28:56,402
I know exactly what you'll say

306
00:28:56,748 --> 00:28:59,444
But at least listen...

307
00:28:59,951 --> 00:29:02,545
Maybe later... if I have the time

308
00:29:02,721 --> 00:29:04,188
But...

309
00:29:33,685 --> 00:29:35,744
I like this one...
- Her nose is too large

310
00:29:35,987 --> 00:29:37,955
Her bank balance is larger

311
00:29:38,223 --> 00:29:40,657
"Let it be, Dad.
Raj doesn't want to marry."

312
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,790
A man's life is incomplete
until he's marries

313
00:29:44,096 --> 00:29:46,064
"After that, it's finished!"

314
00:29:46,998 --> 00:29:48,465
See this one

315
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,798
I'm the umpire. You are out.
Your wicket has fallen

316
00:29:53,004 --> 00:29:56,963
Get this straight.
My wicket cannot fall

317
00:29:58,343 --> 00:30:01,779
This time I have such winners lined up
that you'll be bowled over

318
00:30:02,314 --> 00:30:06,580
These are our future
sisters-in-law?

319
00:30:06,751 --> 00:30:08,981
"Yes.
- Not all, stupid. Just one"

320
00:30:10,922 --> 00:30:13,755
"Raj, take a look"

321
00:30:14,025 --> 00:30:16,425
"Poonam, an interior designer"

322
00:30:17,028 --> 00:30:20,429
"Reshma, MBA. Kavita, Priya..."

323
00:30:22,234 --> 00:30:24,702
"Rachna, who you'll meet this evening"

324
00:30:25,036 --> 00:30:26,799
Who said so?
- I did

325
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:29,006
"I didn't, did I?
- But you've to listen to what I say"

326
00:30:29,107 --> 00:30:30,734
How can you decide
without asking me?

327
00:30:30,842 --> 00:30:32,810
I've asked you so often-
you never reply

328
00:30:32,944 --> 00:30:36,004
"But, I don't...
- No buts. Pick one of these five,"

329
00:30:36,248 --> 00:30:38,739
We can have a joint wedding -
Nikki and you combined

330
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,677
Buy one get one free!

331
00:30:43,255 --> 00:30:45,815
This isn't a money-saving scheme.
It's my whole life on the line

332
00:30:46,057 --> 00:30:48,821
Exactly.
I'm doing this for your happiness.

333
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,029
After all I'm like a father to you.
- But you're not my father!

334
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,370
Uncle!

335
00:31:03,475 --> 00:31:05,636
"Nikki, make him understand..."

336
00:31:06,344 --> 00:31:08,335
You upset him. You pacify him

337
00:31:20,492 --> 00:31:23,052
I've convinced the American buyers
to see our collection

338
00:31:23,461 --> 00:31:27,864
They will be here on the 19th.
I'm sure we'll get the order

339
00:31:29,167 --> 00:31:32,500
"After such a successful trip,
can I expect a promotion?"

340
00:31:34,406 --> 00:31:37,068
Who do you young people
think you are?

341
00:31:38,176 --> 00:31:40,167
You know it all!

342
00:31:40,745 --> 00:31:43,737
"Our generation, it seems,
knows nothing"

343
00:31:44,082 --> 00:31:49,782
"Uncle, you misunderstood.
We're nothing without you."

344
00:31:50,188 --> 00:31:51,883
"Sir, I'll be back later"

345
00:31:54,192 --> 00:31:55,819
You stay here

346
00:31:55,961 --> 00:31:58,088
"Sit.
- Yes, sir"

347
00:31:58,496 --> 00:32:01,363
I'd rather talk to you in private

348
00:32:01,566 --> 00:32:03,363
"Sir, I'll come back...
- Sit"

349
00:32:04,769 --> 00:32:05,758
"Yes, sir"

350
00:32:05,904 --> 00:32:08,498
"Tell this young man,
I've heard enough from him"

351
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,200
"Uncle, I didn't mean it.
Don't be angry, please"

352
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:14,270
Me? Ask him...

353
00:32:14,446 --> 00:32:17,438
What right I have
to be angry with him

354
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:23,883
"Uncle, you've always
treated me like a son"

355
00:32:24,122 --> 00:32:26,522
And I've regarded you as a father.

356
00:32:28,126 --> 00:32:31,323
"So, ask him...
Will he see the girls?"

357
00:32:31,563 --> 00:32:33,292
"Sir?
- No, Uncle"

358
00:32:33,465 --> 00:32:37,128
"Fine. Namrata, you were saying..."

359
00:32:41,773 --> 00:32:43,764
You come here

360
00:32:46,144 --> 00:32:49,477
Sit... and listen

361
00:32:49,948 --> 00:32:52,815
"I said to this gentleman,
you're old enough now..."

362
00:32:53,218 --> 00:32:56,153
"Meet some girls.
If you like one, marry her"

363
00:32:57,155 --> 00:33:00,488
"Did I say something wrong?
- Not at all, sir"

364
00:33:02,227 --> 00:33:05,162
"Look, I'm not against marriage.
- Then..."

365
00:33:05,497 --> 00:33:07,488
ask him what the problem is.

366
00:33:07,632 --> 00:33:10,829
Explain to him... Please.
- What?

367
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:16,834
That it's absurd to meet a girl
with hordes of her relatives around

368
00:33:17,175 --> 00:33:18,972
How can I talk to her?

369
00:33:19,511 --> 00:33:22,912
"Sir, I think he wants to
meet the girls in private"

370
00:33:23,548 --> 00:33:24,537
What?

371
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:27,641
This is not America.
All that doesn't work here

372
00:33:27,819 --> 00:33:30,788
That's the problem...
I can't have a heart-to-heart

373
00:33:32,357 --> 00:33:34,518
Why not send Nikki with Raj?

374
00:33:37,195 --> 00:33:39,993
"You'll manage a heart to heart
with Nikki there, surely?"

375
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:45,196
Nikki's caught up
with wedding preparations.

376
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:49,531
"Otherwise, it was a good idea.
- Sir, you could send someone else"

377
00:33:51,076 --> 00:33:52,805
Who?

378
00:33:53,378 --> 00:33:55,744
He won't take me along.

379
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,006
Puja and Aria are too young.
And he doesn't know anyone else.

380
00:33:59,284 --> 00:34:01,275
So the bride hunt is off!

381
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:05,483
Wait

382
00:34:09,027 --> 00:34:11,222
Namrata will go with you

383
00:34:11,563 --> 00:34:16,899
"But, a family member
should be present"

384
00:34:17,302 --> 00:34:20,237
Don't worry.
I'll take care of all that.

385
00:34:21,439 --> 00:34:25,569
"But, sir...
- You want a promotion, right?"

386
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,647
Get started

387
00:34:35,253 --> 00:34:37,915
"But, Uncle...
- Now what?"

388
00:34:38,256 --> 00:34:40,520
Nothing... Can I go?

389
00:34:48,266 --> 00:34:50,928
You chose to meet Rachna
at a temple?

390
00:34:51,336 --> 00:34:56,831
With you and uncle against me.
I need god on my side.

391
00:34:59,277 --> 00:35:02,508
You're sure that immersing
a silver coin...

392
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,240
makes a wish come true?
- 100 percent

393
00:35:05,617 --> 00:35:08,085
You know the stable behind
our house... Gulab Singh's?

394
00:35:08,286 --> 00:35:10,083
"Yes.
- His horse, Lovely..."

395
00:35:10,288 --> 00:35:13,416
"The black one?
- No, the white. A major problem."

396
00:35:13,725 --> 00:35:17,092
No offspring. So he threw coins
in here and got twins

397
00:35:17,295 --> 00:35:20,856
"Gulab Singh got twins?
- No, the horse did"

398
00:35:21,299 --> 00:35:24,268
How did the horse throw the coins?
- Gulab Singh did that

399
00:35:24,569 --> 00:35:26,662
I see.
- How much is a silver coin?

400
00:35:27,472 --> 00:35:29,303
Rs 101

401
00:35:30,108 --> 00:35:32,076
"Give him the money, quick.
Hurry or we'll lose our turn"

402
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,940
"The money's with you,
how can I pay him?"

403
00:35:35,313 --> 00:35:38,282
I kept the cash in my socks
and left my socks in the car

404
00:35:38,483 --> 00:35:41,714
How ridiculous! Hiding money
in your socks. Go and get it

405
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,319
I'm going
- I'll stand in the queue

406
00:35:43,421 --> 00:35:45,082
We mustn't lose our place

407
00:35:46,658 --> 00:35:49,126
"The keys are with me.
Here, catch."

408
00:36:06,344 --> 00:36:09,472
Avoid brawls in temples...
- Sardarji just grabbed my hand

409
00:36:09,747 --> 00:36:11,044
What?

410
00:36:11,316 --> 00:36:14,114
"Brother, I tried to catch my keys
and caught sister-in-law's hand instead"

411
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:17,311
I'm not your sister-in-law.
- I'm no villain

412
00:36:17,489 --> 00:36:21,323
We've come from miles away to immerse
coins and make our wish come true

413
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:23,925
Me and my Mrs...
Minty come quickly

414
00:36:24,128 --> 00:36:25,322
What's the matter?

415
00:36:25,396 --> 00:36:27,626
This man claims I grabbed
his wife's hand

416
00:36:29,334 --> 00:36:33,327
"Not my wife, my sister-in-law.
- I am not your sister in law!"

417
00:36:33,705 --> 00:36:36,003
Ok... sister. Forgive me.

418
00:36:36,341 --> 00:36:40,334
Please forgive him.
I'm his wife Minty

419
00:36:40,678 --> 00:36:43,146
"He didn't mean it -
He doesn't act fresh, even with me"

420
00:36:50,355 --> 00:36:51,344
Rachna?

421
00:37:04,702 --> 00:37:07,694
Go make a phone call...
- To whom?

422
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:09,161
Anyone

423
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:12,366
"Uncle, of course"

424
00:37:21,386 --> 00:37:25,379
I wanted to ask-
Why meet at a temple?

425
00:37:29,394 --> 00:37:31,385
You believe in re-birth?

426
00:37:32,096 --> 00:37:34,189
What? I mean...

427
00:37:42,407 --> 00:37:46,070
What happens after death?
- How would I know?

428
00:37:48,813 --> 00:37:51,407
I haven't experienced death.

429
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:53,679
No?

430
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:57,217
You mean that I have?

431
00:38:00,425 --> 00:38:02,916
You don't remember?
- What?

432
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,762
You fell from a cliff

433
00:38:08,433 --> 00:38:10,765
We went as pilgrims to Kedarnath.

434
00:38:11,502 --> 00:38:13,629
Babloo was with us

435
00:38:23,548 --> 00:38:25,448
Our beloved child

436
00:38:28,453 --> 00:38:31,445
"Remember, he was so thirsty
that day"

437
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:35,722
You handed him to me.

438
00:38:36,961 --> 00:38:39,452
And set out to get water for him

439
00:38:42,634 --> 00:38:44,625
You never came back

440
00:38:48,573 --> 00:38:51,201
"Three days later,
We discovered your corpse!"

441
00:38:52,543 --> 00:38:53,976
My corpse?

442
00:38:54,145 --> 00:38:59,481
"Don't worry,
I never remarried."

443
00:39:01,586 --> 00:39:04,146
I took good care of Babloo

444
00:39:05,556 --> 00:39:09,492
"Do you know, he's
a vegetable vendor now!"

445
00:39:12,997 --> 00:39:15,488
When you were about to be reborn

446
00:39:18,403 --> 00:39:21,099
"so I jumped off the same cliff
to end my life, Savitri"

447
00:39:21,506 --> 00:39:23,497
"Savitri?
- Yes, Savi."

448
00:39:24,108 --> 00:39:28,272
True love has reunited us.
Now Kishen won't lose his Savi

449
00:39:28,613 --> 00:39:31,912
"Come, Savi. The temple's here.
We can get married at once"

450
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:35,512
One minute...
I'll take off my shoes...

451
00:39:36,187 --> 00:39:37,176
Savi?

452
00:39:37,321 --> 00:39:40,119
What's the matter?
- He's crazy.

453
00:39:40,525 --> 00:39:42,516
Why introduce me to this lunatic?

454
00:39:45,963 --> 00:39:50,525
Why did I get involved with you?
- Who told you to get involved?

455
00:39:50,902 --> 00:39:53,530
You two are fighting again?

456
00:39:53,871 --> 00:39:57,307
It happens when you're just married.
Don't worry.

457
00:39:57,608 --> 00:39:59,872
You'll get used to it soon.

458
00:40:00,545 --> 00:40:02,342
I've upset her again

459
00:40:02,547 --> 00:40:06,142
Let's go.
Where are the keys?

460
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:09,217
Here.
- This is a coin

461
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:13,556
So I threw the keys in the water.
- Oh God!

462
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:17,560
I think that Raj really does not
want to marry

463
00:40:17,862 --> 00:40:21,320
We shouldn't force him.
- That's not it

464
00:40:21,966 --> 00:40:26,062
The problem is that he's never
met someone he connects with

465
00:40:27,705 --> 00:40:34,577
"Next time, take him to a cool place"

466
00:40:34,912 --> 00:40:37,540
Get him in the mood...

467
00:40:40,017 --> 00:40:41,985
I knew you'd like this place

468
00:40:42,653 --> 00:40:44,621
"Raj, come on.
- Where?"

469
00:40:44,889 --> 00:40:47,357
I told Poonam we'll meet upstairs

470
00:40:47,658 --> 00:40:50,593
"It's less crowded,
you two can talk and..."

471
00:40:51,596 --> 00:40:53,564
You take such good care of me!

472
00:40:54,899 --> 00:40:58,062
Poonam's an interior designer.
She studied in New York

473
00:40:58,669 --> 00:41:01,604
What's that famous college called?
- Gaitonde Institute of Design

474
00:41:02,206 --> 00:41:05,767
Stop kidding.
- I'm listening. I went to NYU

475
00:41:06,611 --> 00:41:09,580
"If you don't know anything about
Poonam, how will you talk to her?"

476
00:41:10,615 --> 00:41:13,379
I know what to say.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

477
00:41:13,618 --> 00:41:16,314
There's Poonam.
Doesn't she look cute?

478
00:41:28,299 --> 00:41:30,267
My friends call me Pony

479
00:41:41,612 --> 00:41:43,910
When you let down your hair
what do they call you?

480
00:41:44,615 --> 00:41:45,604
Pony!

481
00:41:53,624 --> 00:41:56,286
What will you have?
- Vodka!

482
00:41:56,627 --> 00:42:00,028
"Sir, this is not your drink, sir
- Put it down"

483
00:42:00,698 --> 00:42:02,893
First ask Pony what she'd like?

484
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:11,369
What will you drink?

485
00:42:12,376 --> 00:42:15,311
No hard drinks for me.
One Virgin Pina Colada

486
00:42:16,647 --> 00:42:19,047
One Virgin Pony Colada...

487
00:42:22,553 --> 00:42:25,989
"And you, Namrata?
- A Coke. No ice"

488
00:42:28,726 --> 00:42:31,661
You need to make a phone call

489
00:42:32,029 --> 00:42:34,020
I did already

490
00:42:35,766 --> 00:42:37,529
What are your hobbies?

491
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:50,943
Checking out potential brides.

492
00:42:52,116 --> 00:42:57,110
I come here every summer
and meet a line-up of girls

493
00:42:57,555 --> 00:43:00,490
It keeps my Uncle happy.
He considers his time well-spent

494
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:13,033
I cannot marry you

495
00:43:13,537 --> 00:43:15,698
"I can't marry you either,
I'm so happy to hear you say..."

496
00:43:22,613 --> 00:43:24,604
Why did you have to hurt
her feelings?

497
00:43:30,888 --> 00:43:35,382
"Sir, your drinks.
- Under the table"

498
00:43:46,737 --> 00:43:52,232
That's not it... It's him.

499
00:43:56,247 --> 00:44:00,149
The one in the ugly shirt?
- In the grey jacket... Vikram

500
00:44:04,188 --> 00:44:06,554
My first and only love

501
00:44:08,759 --> 00:44:13,458
What happened to him?
- When we last met we had a big fight

502
00:44:13,764 --> 00:44:16,927
He didn't like my dress.
Know what he said?

503
00:44:17,335 --> 00:44:21,499
"Pony, I can find thousands like you!
Can you believe it?"

504
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:26,776
So I told him that
I could find thousands like him

505
00:44:27,878 --> 00:44:35,785
I thought I'd marry someone else
And teach him a lesson...

506
00:44:36,787 --> 00:44:40,780
But the truth is really I love Vikram

507
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:43,787
I cannot live without him.
I swear

508
00:44:44,795 --> 00:44:46,592
Thank god.
- What?

509
00:44:46,797 --> 00:44:49,789
"Don't worry, Pony,
we won't let you die"

510
00:44:50,234 --> 00:44:51,792
But what can you do?

511
00:45:05,616 --> 00:45:08,813
"From the moment
I saw you today"

512
00:45:18,896 --> 00:45:22,161
"From the moment
I saw you today"

513
00:45:22,466 --> 00:45:25,230
The stars shone brighter

514
00:45:25,836 --> 00:45:31,797
"My whole world changed-
The moment I saw you"

515
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:49,359
"From the moment
I saw you today"

516
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,658
The stars shone brighter

517
00:45:53,164 --> 00:46:00,229
"My whole world changed-
The moment I saw you"

518
00:46:27,665 --> 00:46:29,496
You are my love...

519
00:46:31,235 --> 00:46:32,862
"you are the one
I dream of"

520
00:46:34,538 --> 00:46:37,371
"You mean the life to me.
In you, I find my peace"

521
00:46:41,645 --> 00:46:44,273
"You are my love, my beloved..."

522
00:46:44,415 --> 00:46:47,873
"you are the sweetheart
I think of all day and night"

523
00:46:48,252 --> 00:46:54,282
"You are my desire.
You are my goal..."

524
00:46:54,892 --> 00:47:01,297
"You are the one who possesses me
in heart and soul"

525
00:47:01,899 --> 00:47:08,304
"You are the only one I seek,
the only one I know"

526
00:47:25,923 --> 00:47:28,915
"From the moment
I saw you today"

527
00:47:29,326 --> 00:47:32,318
The stars shone brighter

528
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:39,335
"My whole world changed-
The moment I saw you"

529
00:48:05,696 --> 00:48:11,635
"You are my desire,
you are my friend, my beloved"

530
00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:18,365
"You are the one I worship...
my heart is yours"

531
00:48:25,983 --> 00:48:31,979
"You are the form, you are the hues.
You are the scorching sun and the shade"

532
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:38,993
"You are a bewitching beauty
who wields the magic"

533
00:48:39,997 --> 00:48:45,993
"You are the only one
my eyes follow"

534
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:26,532
Why do I get the feeling...
- Some things are meant to be

535
00:49:28,412 --> 00:49:30,039
"It's true, isn't it"

536
00:49:34,451 --> 00:49:36,646
Meaning?
- You don't think so?

537
00:49:37,054 --> 00:49:38,214
Think what?

538
00:49:39,156 --> 00:49:41,386
If we hadn't met today...

539
00:49:41,725 --> 00:49:44,592
Then maybe Pony and Vikram
wouldn't have met

540
00:49:46,063 --> 00:49:49,055
Pony and Vikram
...how lucky they are

541
00:49:54,071 --> 00:49:57,871
You think they truly love
each other?

542
00:50:05,082 --> 00:50:08,882
How can one tell it's true love?

543
00:50:10,087 --> 00:50:11,884
You just know

544
00:50:12,289 --> 00:50:14,883
When you can't sleep at night

545
00:50:16,093 --> 00:50:18,755
And each day seems endless
without that person

546
00:50:27,404 --> 00:50:32,103
Why must he send roses
every single day?

547
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:38,070
"When you grow up,
you'll get roses every day too"

548
00:50:38,282 --> 00:50:39,681
Why?

549
00:50:40,117 --> 00:50:43,780
"When a boy sends roses to a girl,
it means..."

550
00:50:48,258 --> 00:50:51,125
I love you

551
00:50:59,136 --> 00:51:02,537
"Raj, you're in love aren't you?"

552
00:51:05,142 --> 00:51:06,370
Who's she?

553
00:51:12,149 --> 00:51:15,118
Can you keep a secret?

554
00:51:18,155 --> 00:51:19,383
Tell me...

555
00:51:22,659 --> 00:51:23,626
Namrata!

556
00:51:41,178 --> 00:51:43,544
"Raj, you there yet?
- Where are you?"

557
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,545
In the office...
- Still?

558
00:51:45,682 --> 00:51:49,140
I'll leave in ten minutes.
Chat with Kavita till then

559
00:51:50,387 --> 00:51:51,354
Kavita?

560
00:51:57,694 --> 00:52:00,561
I liked you the minute
I saw your picture...

561
00:52:01,165 --> 00:52:04,566
But how did you know
what I like...

562
00:52:06,303 --> 00:52:08,567
Like what?
- This

563
00:52:12,176 --> 00:52:13,575
I've no idea

564
00:52:14,445 --> 00:52:17,972
You guessed?
- No

565
00:52:19,683 --> 00:52:25,588
Why put it there?
Give it to who it's meant for

566
00:52:28,192 --> 00:52:31,184
"Don't worry, I will"

567
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:37,599
What are your hobbies?

568
00:52:39,403 --> 00:52:40,529
Hobbies!

569
00:53:01,225 --> 00:53:02,886
"Son, do me a favour, please?"

570
00:53:05,229 --> 00:53:08,221
My mummy said not to talk
to strangers

571
00:53:09,733 --> 00:53:11,223
Sit.

572
00:53:13,737 --> 00:53:16,638
I'm Raj. I'm from America. You?

573
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:19,641
I'm Adi.
From St. Peter's Boarding School

574
00:53:21,245 --> 00:53:24,646
"Now we're not strangers, right?"

575
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:30,243
"Adi, please help me...
I'll buy you an ice-cream"

576
00:53:32,556 --> 00:53:34,251
"In that case, what can I do?"

577
00:53:42,766 --> 00:53:44,666
You're forward...

578
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:47,669
My new mummy!

579
00:53:48,071 --> 00:53:50,266
When are you coming home
to stay with us

580
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:51,932
We'll have lots of fun

581
00:53:53,944 --> 00:53:56,276
That's not your mummy.
This one is

582
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:59,276
"My new mummy,
when are you moving in with us..."

583
00:53:59,449 --> 00:54:01,679
We'll have so much fun together.
What?

584
00:54:02,286 --> 00:54:03,275
Poor boy.

585
00:54:04,521 --> 00:54:08,287
"Ever since his mother left us, he
imagines that every woman is his mother."

586
00:54:09,293 --> 00:54:12,694
He misses a mother's love desperately.
- You're married?

587
00:54:13,297 --> 00:54:15,697
And divorced. I'm available.

588
00:54:15,799 --> 00:54:18,700
Enough?
- See how much he loves you already!

589
00:54:20,304 --> 00:54:22,704
We'll make a happy foursome.

590
00:54:22,873 --> 00:54:25,706
"Four?
- Yes, his brother's at home: Babloo"

591
00:54:53,337 --> 00:54:55,328
You gave me a scare!

592
00:55:02,846 --> 00:55:04,746
"Adi, give me those photos"

593
00:55:05,616 --> 00:55:06,605
No

594
00:55:08,352 --> 00:55:12,345
Then you know what you
won't get after lunch...

595
00:55:30,374 --> 00:55:31,773
What are you cooking?

596
00:55:32,876 --> 00:55:34,776
"Didi, tell them both
to listen to me"

597
00:55:35,012 --> 00:55:37,776
Puja's in charge today.
You two must listen to her

598
00:55:38,882 --> 00:55:40,782
Understood?
- Never!

599
00:55:41,385 --> 00:55:42,784
Never!

600
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:52,351
This paneer is delicious. I wish I didn't
have to go to Ajay's for lunch.

601
00:55:52,729 --> 00:55:55,391
Their food is quite bad.
- What a good daughter-in-law!

602
00:55:57,801 --> 00:56:01,760
Who are these moustachioed girls?
- Brides for your darling brother

603
00:56:02,406 --> 00:56:04,374
But he doesn't need to meet any

604
00:56:05,409 --> 00:56:06,376
Why?

605
00:56:07,411 --> 00:56:11,814
He didn't tell you?
- Raj likes someone?

606
00:56:12,749 --> 00:56:15,377
I can't say a word.
I promised him

607
00:56:15,652 --> 00:56:17,779
"And I did nothing for him,
why should he tell me?"

608
00:56:17,921 --> 00:56:19,821
"If he won't tell you,
who will he tell?"

609
00:56:22,426 --> 00:56:24,394
Tell me who she is

610
00:57:29,292 --> 00:57:33,854
When you steal a glance at me

611
00:57:34,464 --> 00:57:36,455
You leave me breathless

612
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:43,863
When you play with a straying hair

613
00:57:44,474 --> 00:57:46,465
You leave me breathless

614
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:56,883
When you look at me that way

615
00:57:57,988 --> 00:57:59,888
You leave me breathless

616
00:58:03,493 --> 00:58:07,486
When you show your love so openly

617
00:58:08,498 --> 00:58:10,489
You leave me breathless

618
00:58:16,006 --> 00:58:24,914
"You possess every quality,
my love..."

619
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:31,917
"The innocence, the freshness,
the mischief, the naivete..."

620
00:58:34,524 --> 00:58:37,925
"You are the one I have
given my heart to"

621
00:58:39,529 --> 00:58:43,522
My freshness is thanks to you

622
00:58:45,035 --> 00:58:49,938
"Thanks to your love,
I am beautiful"

623
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:52,940
"Every hue, I have got from you"

624
00:58:53,076 --> 00:58:56,944
"When you feel shy
at my praise..."

625
00:58:57,948 --> 00:59:00,542
you leave me breathless

626
00:59:03,687 --> 00:59:07,555
"When you laugh,
when you put on airs..."

627
00:59:08,558 --> 00:59:10,958
you leave me breathless

628
01:00:47,157 --> 01:00:51,059
Why do you look lost?

629
01:00:52,662 --> 01:00:56,621
"What thoughts are you
lost in?"

630
01:00:58,568 --> 01:01:03,028
"That which is in your heart,
tell me too"

631
01:01:08,411 --> 01:01:17,080
"I wonder how
I must address you"

632
01:01:19,322 --> 01:01:24,089
"My beautiful one...?
Or my beloved?"

633
01:01:24,361 --> 01:01:27,091
"But those are
already your names"

634
01:01:27,197 --> 01:01:31,099
"When you tell me
I have so many names..."

635
01:01:32,102 --> 01:01:34,070
You leave me breathless

636
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:15,761
My birds!

637
01:03:20,176 --> 01:03:22,770
"You brat, why are you doing this?"

638
01:03:23,179 --> 01:03:26,171
I'll lock you in this cage
for the rest of your life!

639
01:03:26,282 --> 01:03:27,408
Where did you go...

640
01:03:29,786 --> 01:03:32,186
"Adi, what's up?
- Where's that rascal?"

641
01:03:33,223 --> 01:03:35,783
You're the rascal!
- I won't let you go

642
01:03:36,092 --> 01:03:38,458
Who are you?
- His father

643
01:03:38,962 --> 01:03:41,192
He won't let you go!

644
01:03:42,065 --> 01:03:46,798
"I've travelled long and far,
and scaled the Himalayan peaks..."

645
01:03:47,103 --> 01:03:52,200
to catch each little bird.
And your brat...

646
01:03:52,809 --> 01:03:59,214
"Sorry, your little darling,
let them all fly away"

647
01:03:59,816 --> 01:04:01,943
I've lost everything...

648
01:04:02,118 --> 01:04:07,215
He's lying! He catches the birds
right here and spray-paints them

649
01:04:11,828 --> 01:04:13,227
Hey...

650
01:04:13,997 --> 01:04:15,828
Tell me

651
01:04:17,133 --> 01:04:21,229
How can such a small boy
open such a complicated cage?

652
01:04:21,471 --> 01:04:24,235
"Sir, he did.
- Can't be"

653
01:04:25,842 --> 01:04:31,508
I swear on the open cage
that he did...

654
01:04:31,848 --> 01:04:34,248
"Don't believe it.
- He opened it, I swear"

655
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:36,841
I don't believe it.
- Shall I show you?

656
01:04:37,353 --> 01:04:39,253
"Adi, show us
- Brat-"

657
01:04:40,356 --> 01:04:44,258
"Dear child, show your daddy
how clever you are"

658
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:47,852
How you opened the cage
and let the birds out

659
01:04:47,964 --> 01:04:49,454
Show us

660
01:05:04,881 --> 01:05:08,282
My birds...
My bread-winners...

661
01:05:08,484 --> 01:05:12,284
"are gone, thanks to him."

662
01:05:16,292 --> 01:05:17,884
"What's this, sir?"

663
01:05:18,294 --> 01:05:20,285
You ok now?
- Thank you sir.

664
01:05:21,497 --> 01:05:24,295
This time I'm being kind-
- To the birds?

665
01:05:24,567 --> 01:05:29,300
"No, to you.
If I see you with this cage again..."

666
01:05:29,439 --> 01:05:35,309
I'll spray-paint you till you're
one of the birds. Understood?

667
01:05:36,412 --> 01:05:38,312
Lower your lungi.
And get going...

668
01:05:38,915 --> 01:05:40,314
This is a decent neighbourhood.

669
01:05:49,926 --> 01:05:51,917
Let me treat you today

670
01:05:52,929 --> 01:05:54,328
"Some other time, okay?"

671
01:06:10,346 --> 01:06:14,305
What you doing here?
- I was looking for you.

672
01:06:15,218 --> 01:06:17,948
I believe you told Nikki
you like someone

673
01:06:18,021 --> 01:06:22,355
"And you didn't tell me?
Actually, Namrata l-"

674
01:06:22,959 --> 01:06:24,927
"Mom, look at all the fish..."

675
01:06:34,971 --> 01:06:37,371
There's so many!
- What if something happened?

676
01:06:37,974 --> 01:06:39,942
Look
- What if you'd fallen in?

677
01:07:06,002 --> 01:07:09,961
Raj's my friend - we've met before

678
01:07:12,008 --> 01:07:13,976
You know my son?

679
01:07:19,015 --> 01:07:22,974
"Don't tell her where we met.
That's our secret,"

680
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:27,979
Come home and we'll see
who keeps secrets from whom!

681
01:07:28,191 --> 01:07:29,988
What happened with the birds?

682
01:07:30,526 --> 01:07:33,984
He traps birds
and spray-paints them!

683
01:08:12,034 --> 01:08:14,025
"Raj, what are you doing here?"

684
01:08:14,437 --> 01:08:16,428
Why? I live here.

685
01:08:16,672 --> 01:08:18,731
But this is my hiding place

686
01:08:19,041 --> 01:08:24,035
"No, it's mine... and has been
since I was your age"

687
01:08:25,047 --> 01:08:26,446
Who are you hiding from?

688
01:08:26,549 --> 01:08:30,041
Aria. I don't play with girls

689
01:08:33,556 --> 01:08:35,456
Who are you hiding from?

690
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:37,826
No one

691
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:42,053
Then why are you here?
- I'm in a bad mood

692
01:08:42,365 --> 01:08:45,061
Why?
- You won't understand

693
01:08:45,168 --> 01:08:48,069
Why?
- It's grown-up stuff

694
01:08:48,204 --> 01:08:50,069
Do I look small to you?

695
01:08:52,575 --> 01:08:53,564
OK.

696
01:08:55,578 --> 01:08:58,069
I'm in a bad mood because...

697
01:08:58,748 --> 01:09:02,081
I'm in love with someone
who can't love me back

698
01:09:02,385 --> 01:09:03,374
Why?

699
01:09:05,087 --> 01:09:08,488
I don't know.
- Then who knows? God?

700
01:09:10,593 --> 01:09:11,582
Maybe

701
01:09:13,596 --> 01:09:17,088
Mom says God knows everything.

702
01:09:17,366 --> 01:09:20,767
So I think God must know
where my Dad is

703
01:09:21,103 --> 01:09:22,092
Meaning?

704
01:09:22,371 --> 01:09:27,502
We don't know where he is.
He doesn't even come to my school

705
01:09:28,110 --> 01:09:31,511
All the other dads come.
Only mine doesn't

706
01:09:32,114 --> 01:09:35,515
"So, you could say... I get
into a bad mood"

707
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:39,519
That's Pooja... let's go...

708
01:09:41,624 --> 01:09:46,527
"Raj, you won't tell anyone
about our hiding place, right?"

709
01:09:47,129 --> 01:09:48,528
Never

710
01:09:55,137 --> 01:09:57,537
Out with the money
- What for?

711
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:58,629
It's auspicious!

712
01:10:21,163 --> 01:10:22,562
They caught you didn't they!

713
01:10:24,166 --> 01:10:27,158
"You too, Papa
- Oh no..."

714
01:10:29,839 --> 01:10:31,170
Take this

715
01:10:36,178 --> 01:10:37,668
I'll get back at you!

716
01:10:39,181 --> 01:10:42,173
What did you do now Adi?
- Nothing

717
01:10:42,485 --> 01:10:43,577
I'm sure!

718
01:10:44,186 --> 01:10:47,178
He's so mischievous!
- But he's adorable.

719
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:49,182
Yes.

720
01:10:49,258 --> 01:10:53,194
"Uncle, where's Namrata's husband?
- You don't know? He went away..."

721
01:10:53,329 --> 01:10:55,490
Left both of them years ago

722
01:10:59,535 --> 01:11:04,598
Namrata never talks about it.
She's raised Adi on her own

723
01:11:05,207 --> 01:11:07,607
I've never seen her cry.
Except once

724
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:10,611
When she first left Adi
at his boarding school

725
01:11:26,929 --> 01:11:28,396
Shall I put them on?

726
01:11:30,232 --> 01:11:32,632
What's this?
- Let's see

727
01:11:33,235 --> 01:11:35,203
Give it to me.
I'll make a paper plane

728
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:50,647
Don't you think it's time
you started life over?

729
01:11:50,753 --> 01:11:53,221
I want to put wedding bangles
on you too

730
01:11:54,757 --> 01:11:57,225
"Nikki, you know that can't be"

731
01:12:22,952 --> 01:12:25,648
No way... Lunch first.
I'm coming

732
01:12:27,289 --> 01:12:29,257
Let's be quick

733
01:12:30,693 --> 01:12:33,924
"Namrata, you've put bangles on Nikki,
but what about..."

734
01:12:34,296 --> 01:12:37,265
"a wedding turban for Raj?
- Very soon, sir"

735
01:12:37,433 --> 01:12:41,062
I don't want to meet any more girls.
- Have you found someone?

736
01:12:43,305 --> 01:12:44,272
"No, Uncle"

737
01:12:45,307 --> 01:12:47,901
"Sir, leave it to me.
I'll find someone for him"

738
01:12:50,312 --> 01:12:52,678
You won't understand.
- What won't she understand?

739
01:12:52,982 --> 01:12:55,678
Because it's grown up stuff.
I've eaten

740
01:13:00,289 --> 01:13:02,951
Tell Aria to give back my plane

741
01:13:03,292 --> 01:13:05,954
Forget the paper plane...
come with me

742
01:13:08,597 --> 01:13:10,690
Boys box... like this

743
01:13:15,971 --> 01:13:17,438
"Not like that, like this"

744
01:13:20,309 --> 01:13:24,302
What happened?
You're hurt? Are you a girl?

745
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:25,469
No.

746
01:13:37,593 --> 01:13:41,461
I'll show them all how to box
at school. I'll knock them out

747
01:13:41,697 --> 01:13:44,723
Who?
- The big guys. They make fun of me

748
01:13:46,335 --> 01:13:50,328
Really? Punch them like this then...
and this...

749
01:13:55,344 --> 01:13:57,972
"Raj, will you be my Dad
and come to school?"

750
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:06,351
"Shall we go, Adi?"

751
01:14:06,489 --> 01:14:12,359
"Mom, tell Raj to come with us.
Those boys will be afraid of him"

752
01:14:12,461 --> 01:14:14,361
They won't tease me then.

753
01:14:16,866 --> 01:14:18,766
"Raj, you'll come, won't you?"

754
01:14:19,535 --> 01:14:22,368
I've got an idea.
In a couple of days...

755
01:14:22,505 --> 01:14:25,770
"I'll make you such good boxer that
you'll fix them, on your own!"

756
01:14:27,543 --> 01:14:32,378
Adi misses his father very much.
- I understand

757
01:14:33,716 --> 01:14:35,377
So you'll come?

758
01:14:36,385 --> 01:14:40,048
Sorry?
- With us... to school?

759
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:43,782
No... I meant...

760
01:14:45,694 --> 01:14:48,060
Think only you can crack jokes?

761
01:14:49,632 --> 01:14:51,793
"Adi, put on your shoes"

762
01:14:53,402 --> 01:14:55,597
"If you want me to,
I will come"

763
01:14:56,806 --> 01:14:58,398
I was joking

764
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:04,405
I don't have a problem with it.
- I don't want to bother you

765
01:15:08,417 --> 01:15:10,078
But it will make Adi happy

766
01:15:12,688 --> 01:15:14,417
"So, Raj is coming?"

767
01:15:16,425 --> 01:15:17,414
Yes

768
01:15:47,456 --> 01:15:49,447
"Mom, let's box"

769
01:15:51,861 --> 01:15:53,852
I can't box.
Box with Raj tomorrow

770
01:15:54,463 --> 01:15:56,454
What will we play now?

771
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:03,704
Play with this plane

772
01:16:04,473 --> 01:16:07,874
First brush your teeth.
- Give me the plane

773
01:16:08,978 --> 01:16:11,469
Give me the plane or
I won't brush my teeth

774
01:16:11,614 --> 01:16:14,481
Think about it. Raj doesn't box
with dirty kids

775
01:16:14,617 --> 01:16:16,482
Really?
- Yes.

776
01:16:23,058 --> 01:16:25,891
"Namrata, I have good news"

777
01:16:27,663 --> 01:16:29,893
I've found a girl for myself

778
01:16:30,499 --> 01:16:32,467
And that girl is...

779
01:16:33,502 --> 01:16:34,469
You

780
01:16:38,507 --> 01:16:42,910
Suddenly I feel like I'm incomplete
without you and you without me

781
01:16:44,513 --> 01:16:49,473
I don't know why I sense
that you love me

782
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:52,516
As much as I do you

783
01:16:54,523 --> 01:16:56,491
"Love, Raj"

784
01:17:21,984 --> 01:17:25,351
You think you're Raj?
- Why? Can't moms box?

785
01:17:25,988 --> 01:17:26,955
No

786
01:17:27,456 --> 01:17:31,950
"Moms can cook, go to work,
and box too"

787
01:17:36,265 --> 01:17:40,964
Have you got a cold?
- Why? You scared of me?

788
01:17:47,376 --> 01:17:49,867
You're not hurt are you?
- No!

789
01:17:59,221 --> 01:18:00,984
Did you get hurt sweetie?

790
01:18:01,357 --> 01:18:03,484
You all right? Let's play

791
01:18:28,751 --> 01:18:30,878
Adi... just a minute.

792
01:18:36,025 --> 01:18:38,016
"You can't, Mom."

793
01:18:40,696 --> 01:18:42,687
Let's go to Raj's

794
01:18:43,332 --> 01:18:48,429
We still have to pack.
And go to school tomorrow...

795
01:18:48,537 --> 01:18:50,027
"Oh, right..."

796
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:55,442
Who are you calling?
- Raj. He's coming to school too

797
01:18:56,045 --> 01:18:57,034
Raj?

798
01:18:57,346 --> 01:19:02,045
He's going to be my Dad.
I'll show all of them

799
01:19:03,052 --> 01:19:07,455
Raj can't come with us.
- He said he'd come

800
01:19:07,589 --> 01:19:11,457
"But he's very busy
- If Raj doesn't go, I won't go"

801
01:19:13,362 --> 01:19:18,061
"After this, no more boarding school.
This is your last year"

802
01:19:19,068 --> 01:19:24,062
I won't go without Raj.
All the Dads come there

803
01:19:24,306 --> 01:19:28,072
But Raj isn't your Dad.
- Then where is my Dad?

804
01:19:28,210 --> 01:19:30,770
I don't know
- Why don't you know?

805
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:33,071
How many times do
I have to tell you...

806
01:19:45,094 --> 01:19:47,494
"Look, what Mom has for you"

807
01:19:56,505 --> 01:19:58,496
I won't go without Raj

808
01:19:58,841 --> 01:20:01,105
You will. Didn't you go
before you met him?

809
01:20:01,343 --> 01:20:02,867
Give that back.
- No

810
01:20:04,713 --> 01:20:06,112
"Adi, don't be stubborn"

811
01:20:12,521 --> 01:20:15,820
What's this. What have you done?
You're a bad boy

812
01:20:15,924 --> 01:20:19,291
You're a bad Mom.
You never let me meet my Dad

813
01:20:19,428 --> 01:20:22,522
All the Dads come to school.
Only mine doesn't...

814
01:20:23,132 --> 01:20:26,124
I won't go to school
and you can't make me...

815
01:21:08,677 --> 01:21:11,578
"Mom, I don't want to go
without Raj"

816
01:21:40,409 --> 01:21:43,572
The train will start in five minutes.
That'll be fun

817
01:21:47,216 --> 01:21:50,617
You're upset with me?
Let's get some chocolates

818
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:54,621
Raj will get me chocolates.
- Raj won't come

819
01:21:54,890 --> 01:21:57,586
He promised me.
He will come

820
01:21:59,228 --> 01:22:02,197
"Please keep an eye on him.
- Don't worry, go ahead."

821
01:22:02,631 --> 01:22:04,189
I'll be right back

822
01:22:22,251 --> 01:22:23,616
35 rupees.

823
01:22:23,885 --> 01:22:28,618
Adi's Dad has already
done the needful

824
01:22:32,261 --> 01:22:35,628
"Namrata, what's wrong?
I was joking"

825
01:22:37,799 --> 01:22:40,233
Is this also a joke?

826
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:49,233
"How did you find...
- You wrote it, didn't you?"

827
01:22:52,547 --> 01:22:55,038
Can't we talk about this later?
The train's about to leave

828
01:22:55,183 --> 01:22:56,650
Did you write it or not?

829
01:23:00,455 --> 01:23:04,221
"Namrata, Adi's waiting for me...
- Did you or didn't you?"

830
01:23:07,262 --> 01:23:10,663
"Yes, I did... Can we go now?"

831
01:23:13,268 --> 01:23:17,671
I can't change the fact that
Adi's never seen his father.

832
01:23:18,273 --> 01:23:19,672
But I can't believe that...

833
01:23:19,775 --> 01:23:24,269
you would stoop so low as to
take advantage of it.

834
01:23:26,448 --> 01:23:28,780
That you would try to use Adi
to win me over.

835
01:23:29,951 --> 01:23:34,285
You've got it all wrong.
I did write the letter

836
01:23:34,556 --> 01:23:37,286
But I didn't know then that
Adi was your son.

837
01:23:43,699 --> 01:23:46,691
"When I found out,
I thought about it a lot..."

838
01:23:47,803 --> 01:23:51,705
I realized that though you may have
a thousand reasons to turn me away...

839
01:23:52,307 --> 01:23:55,299
There's just one reason
I can't let you

840
01:23:59,314 --> 01:24:01,305
I can't live without you

841
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:09,313
I promise...
You will be happy with me

842
01:24:10,325 --> 01:24:12,316
Who told you I was unhappy?

843
01:24:12,728 --> 01:24:16,721
You think you're doing me a favour?

844
01:24:17,332 --> 01:24:20,324
You think a mother
can't raise her child alone?

845
01:24:21,336 --> 01:24:23,327
Adi and I are very happy

846
01:24:23,505 --> 01:24:25,735
There's no room for anyone else
in our lives

847
01:24:36,051 --> 01:24:41,011
Why don't you understand?
I love you

848
01:24:42,357 --> 01:24:47,351
Why don't you understand?
I can never love you
