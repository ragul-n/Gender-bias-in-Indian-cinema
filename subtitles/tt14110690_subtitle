1
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:18,658
Instead of enjoying his honeymoon
with his wife at Kashmir

2
00:01:18,754 --> 00:01:23,615
He is on a pilgrimage to
Kasi with these elders.

3
00:01:23,957 --> 00:01:25,192
Meet Saaminathan.

4
00:01:26,047 --> 00:01:30,697
Saaminathan, who's dressed like a
saint, and his friend Aravind

5
00:01:30,918 --> 00:01:34,011
Had a blast during
their college life.

6
00:01:47,043 --> 00:01:50,077
"Face off with me and
I'll rip you apart."

7
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:53,100
"Don't mess with me or
you'll be shredded apart."

8
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:55,741
"Mess with me or be my friend."

9
00:01:56,124 --> 00:01:58,851
"Mess with me or be my friend."

10
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:15,136
"College life - it's a
whole different scene."

11
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:18,276
"Our life is a fun ride
during these three years."

12
00:02:18,542 --> 00:02:21,181
"College life - it's a
whole different scene."

13
00:02:21,486 --> 00:02:24,617
"Our life is a fun ride
during these three years."

14
00:02:24,736 --> 00:02:27,025
"We may have less but
we share our lunches."

15
00:02:27,074 --> 00:02:30,292
"We have fun to the max because
we are the backbenchers."

16
00:02:30,908 --> 00:02:33,293
"We may have less but
we share our lunches."

17
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:36,449
"We have fun to the max because
we are the backbenchers."

18
00:02:36,697 --> 00:02:39,746
"We don't want any riches."

19
00:02:39,904 --> 00:02:41,349
"We don't want any foes."

20
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,108
"All I need are friends."

21
00:02:43,286 --> 00:02:45,966
"We don't want any riches."

22
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:47,602
"We don't want any foes."

23
00:02:47,628 --> 00:02:48,933
"All I need are friends."

24
00:03:05,355 --> 00:03:08,123
"We might copy in exams but
that sharpens our knowledge."

25
00:03:08,263 --> 00:03:11,060
"When the prom is here, we rock
the stage and the college."

26
00:03:11,178 --> 00:03:13,936
"Make way! Make way for us!"

27
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:17,469
"We might copy in exams but
that sharpens our knowledge."

28
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:20,602
"When the prom is here, we rock
the stage and the college."

29
00:03:20,844 --> 00:03:23,782
"Wooing a girl isn't a big deal."

30
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:27,165
"Check our wallets and you'll find
us carrying our friend's photo."

31
00:03:27,295 --> 00:03:30,028
"Wooing a girl isn't a big deal."

32
00:03:30,216 --> 00:03:33,036
"Check our wallets and you'll find
us carrying our friend's photo."

33
00:03:33,144 --> 00:03:34,676
"In our wallets."

34
00:03:34,723 --> 00:03:37,443
"We study for name sake.
And drink beer for our sake."

35
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:40,685
"Mess with my friends,
and I'll break your limbs."

36
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,784
"We study for name sake.
And drink beer for our sake."

37
00:03:44,276 --> 00:03:47,747
"Mess with my friends,
and I'll break your limbs."

38
00:04:00,426 --> 00:04:03,093
"The girls from the neighbouring
college are so beautiful."

39
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,201
"The girls in my college
are not so cool."

40
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:07,585
"Sumathi, he's talking about you."

41
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,558
"The girls from the neighbouring
college are so beautiful."

42
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:15,597
"The girls in my college
are not so cool."

43
00:04:15,776 --> 00:04:18,980
"Well I've piled upon
a lot of backlogs"

44
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:21,972
"I wonder what's gonna
happen to my career."

45
00:04:22,153 --> 00:04:25,175
"Well I've piled upon
a lot of backlogs"

46
00:04:25,253 --> 00:04:28,143
"I wonder what's gonna
happen to my career."

47
00:04:28,275 --> 00:04:29,916
"What's gonna
happen to my career?"

48
00:04:30,018 --> 00:04:32,831
"You are my buddy! You are my pal!"

49
00:04:32,971 --> 00:04:35,779
"You are my friend! You
are my everything!"

50
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:38,811
"You are my buddy! You are my pal!"

51
00:04:39,084 --> 00:04:41,079
"You are my friend! You
are my everything!"

52
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:42,987
Hey! Watch out! Madam!

53
00:05:06,351 --> 00:05:08,380
"Let's welcome what comes to us.
Let's move on from what left us."

54
00:05:08,404 --> 00:05:14,044
Aravind-Saami lived with such a
motto and had time of their lives.

55
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:17,842
Finally their college farewell day brought
a twist in the plot of their life.

56
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,226
Ma'am, two minutes please.

57
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:30,850
Excuse me -No. Wait

58
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,768
I want two minutes with Shruthi.

59
00:05:33,522 --> 00:05:34,378
Okay.

60
00:05:37,281 --> 00:05:40,195
Shruthi, so you wanted to
discuss something important?

61
00:05:40,585 --> 00:05:41,382
What is it?

62
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:42,836
Aravind...

63
00:05:43,101 --> 00:05:46,155
Let's break up. Our
relationship won't workout.

64
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,582
Extremely sorry -What?

65
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:50,241
Break up? What about our
four years relationship?

66
00:05:50,363 --> 00:05:51,402
Is it over?

67
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:53,074
I'm going abroad for
higher studies

68
00:05:53,345 --> 00:05:54,945
I'm planning to
settle down there.

69
00:05:55,317 --> 00:05:57,363
And that's why I'm telling
you this won't workout.

70
00:05:57,387 --> 00:05:57,941
Let's break up.

71
00:05:58,052 --> 00:06:01,310
For four years you enjoyed all the gifts
I got you including that beer shampoo

72
00:06:01,347 --> 00:06:02,533
our relationship
worked then, right?

73
00:06:02,557 --> 00:06:03,057
See...

74
00:06:03,299 --> 00:06:04,434
That's unnecessary.

75
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:06,048
Past it past!

76
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:08,822
You will definitely find
a better girl than me.

77
00:06:08,877 --> 00:06:10,712
What do you mean by "a
better girl than me?"

78
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:11,798
What does that make you?

79
00:06:11,824 --> 00:06:13,110
- Bloody...
- Stupid!

80
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:15,998
Buttermilk!

81
00:06:16,022 --> 00:06:18,835
"The moment when we
both..." move damn it!

82
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,297
Excuse me, Yoga miss.

83
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:23,547
May I come in -What is it?

84
00:06:23,664 --> 00:06:25,719
You need two minutes
with Preethi, right?

85
00:06:26,547 --> 00:06:28,664
Guru Ramesh is hiding behind
the stage awaiting you.

86
00:06:28,774 --> 00:06:29,820
Go and find out
what's the matter

87
00:06:29,844 --> 00:06:32,001
- I totally forgot about it.
- Go! Go!

88
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,665
Wonder what's gonna happen!

89
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:36,719
Preethi, for the
past four years...

90
00:06:36,768 --> 00:06:39,140
I had been gifting you bud
roses as your boy bestie.

91
00:06:39,342 --> 00:06:42,756
But it's time for me to gift
you a red rose and propose you.

92
00:06:43,225 --> 00:06:44,678
I love you

93
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,580
I want to settle in
Sowcarpet, you know?

94
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:51,143
The only reason I was friends
with you for these four years,

95
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:54,075
so that if everybody in the college
believed I was your girlfriend

96
00:06:54,108 --> 00:06:55,916
no one would disturb me

97
00:06:55,955 --> 00:06:57,361
I can concentrate on my studies.

98
00:06:57,642 --> 00:06:59,720
What a fool? Can't you even
get this simple logic?

99
00:07:00,134 --> 00:07:04,150
I have two brides waiting for me yet
I fell in love with you, Preethi!

100
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:06,431
- And you say you used me?
- Exactly!

101
00:07:06,703 --> 00:07:09,016
By the way, I'm not going
to settle in Sowcarpet

102
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:10,460
I got my placement in Bangalore.

103
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:11,849
You better mind
your own business

104
00:07:11,914 --> 00:07:13,220
I indeed run my own business...

105
00:07:13,324 --> 00:07:15,573
Panchabodham travels in Mylapore.
So what?

106
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:18,591
This kind of sarcasm is why
I'm rejecting you! Good bye!

107
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,137
- Preethi! Preethi!
- What?

108
00:07:20,285 --> 00:07:20,994
Come here.

109
00:07:21,638 --> 00:07:22,685
Are you headed this way?

110
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:23,731
Yes. Why?

111
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:24,911
Then give me a kiss and go.

112
00:07:25,255 --> 00:07:26,419
Idiot! Shameless!

113
00:07:45,723 --> 00:07:48,443
- Buddy, Love is of no use.
- It's just timepass.

114
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,841
Girls are selfish.

115
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,527
Dude, girls are waste.

116
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,302
Buddy, friendship is the best.

117
00:07:53,411 --> 00:07:56,214
Dude, friendship is forever.

118
00:07:57,046 --> 00:08:01,734
I have seen many like you talk
friendship philosophy on farewell day.

119
00:08:01,866 --> 00:08:04,851
So stop showing off
and enjoy the party.

120
00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:05,298
Ma'am...

121
00:08:05,842 --> 00:08:07,576
I will do anything for friendship.

122
00:08:07,812 --> 00:08:10,830
Madam, I'll sacrifice
my life for my friend.

123
00:08:11,194 --> 00:08:15,202
First see if you both will
attend each other's wedding.

124
00:08:15,491 --> 00:08:17,147
Then you may boast about friendship.

125
00:08:17,225 --> 00:08:19,195
Wait, I promise this today...

126
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:21,843
Saami's marriage won't
take place without Aravind.

127
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:24,656
And Aravind's marriage won't
take place without Saami.

128
00:08:25,061 --> 00:08:26,710
Now this sounds like

129
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:29,654
you both will get married on the
same day in the same marriage hall.

130
00:08:30,194 --> 00:08:31,358
Is that possible?

131
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:32,998
Is it practically possible?

132
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:36,084
I don't know if it's practically
or theoretically possible.

133
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:37,944
But it will happen for sure!

134
00:08:38,054 --> 00:08:39,686
Do you want me sign a deal?

135
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,475
Are you that serious?

136
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,366
Let's do one thing -What?

137
00:08:44,545 --> 00:08:48,771
Go to the stage and tell
everyone what you told me.

138
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,691
Look here, the party is very boring.

139
00:08:51,873 --> 00:08:53,826
Come on, boys! Let's go.

140
00:08:54,428 --> 00:08:57,725
- Please leave the stage, Mr. Elvis!
- Sir, please just a minute.

141
00:08:59,044 --> 00:09:00,904
Hello my dear students.

142
00:09:00,942 --> 00:09:04,583
We need two minutes of your time
to say something very important.

143
00:09:04,685 --> 00:09:07,648
Then we shall start the
farewell day celebrations.

144
00:09:07,866 --> 00:09:10,156
- So shall we say it?
- Please say it.

145
00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:14,659
Aravind and Saami,
the stage is yours.

146
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,529
Okay auntie, you leave
the stage first.

147
00:09:18,216 --> 00:09:21,185
Attention everyone, we are going
to make a statement today.

148
00:09:21,498 --> 00:09:24,029
And that is going to be
the content of tomorrow.

149
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,838
So please, everybody
open your camera,

150
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:30,163
and take all the
content in your favour.

151
00:09:30,213 --> 00:09:32,820
- Bad rhyming!
- Shut up!

152
00:09:32,908 --> 00:09:34,137
I and my friend...

153
00:09:34,434 --> 00:09:36,403
- On the same day...
- In the same hall...

154
00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:37,559
At the same time...

155
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,466
We will get married
in the same dais.

156
00:09:39,591 --> 00:09:42,568
- If that doesn't happen...
- We will never get married!

157
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:43,708
Congratulations.

158
00:09:44,177 --> 00:09:47,159
You both, right? You've our
blessings, please marry each other.

159
00:09:47,242 --> 00:09:48,730
It's legal now, isn't it?

160
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:50,777
Mr. 'Monkey face' Kumar.

161
00:09:50,985 --> 00:09:55,141
We will marry the love of our lives
at the same time and in the same dias.

162
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:58,978
So don't show off your
word play with us! Okay?

163
00:09:59,117 --> 00:10:00,543
What if you guys fails to do so?

164
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,954
Listen to me mister!

165
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:07,015
If we fail, then you may spit
on me and collect Rs. 5 lakhs!

166
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:10,243
Aravind-Saami... It's all recorded.

167
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:11,329
So don't forget!

168
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,000
Go ahead record because what
we speak is a record itself!

169
00:10:15,069 --> 00:10:18,824
To become the stars of farewell
day and trend in Facebook...

170
00:10:18,873 --> 00:10:22,143
Aravind and Saami
took such an oath!

171
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:25,050
In time, guess where
their oath lead them to?

172
00:10:26,896 --> 00:10:27,865
- Anna (Elder brother)
- Tell me

173
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:29,638
I have a doubt -What?

174
00:10:29,682 --> 00:10:33,014
I read in net that people who
work in navy must shave everyday.

175
00:10:33,414 --> 00:10:34,748
But look at you?

176
00:10:34,898 --> 00:10:36,664
You look like
'Irrudhi Suttru' Madhavan.

177
00:10:37,105 --> 00:10:39,755
Well, the ship in work in was
parked in Dubai for few days.

178
00:10:39,816 --> 00:10:40,690
That's when I grew this beard.

179
00:10:40,824 --> 00:10:43,879
Moreover this is the trend. You
won't know it, focus on the road!

180
00:10:43,903 --> 00:10:44,903
Fine.

181
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:49,738
Tell me, Saami! How are you?

182
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,745
Important issue. Come
to my home at once

183
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,095
I know what you want.
It's in my bag.

184
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,711
Not that...

185
00:10:54,735 --> 00:10:56,642
I'll give it tomorrow morning.
Now, hang up.

186
00:10:56,725 --> 00:10:58,125
Not that. Come here, I'll tell you.

187
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:01,664
Dude, I have ship-lag and jet lag.
I'm exhausted

188
00:11:01,749 --> 00:11:04,115
- I'll give it in the morning.
- It's an important matter.

189
00:11:04,173 --> 00:11:05,922
What is the matter? Just say it!

190
00:11:05,946 --> 00:11:08,212
Dude, I'm getting
married in four days!

191
00:11:08,238 --> 00:11:09,158
What?

192
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,439
Yes, buddy!

193
00:11:12,717 --> 00:11:14,865
- You go home. I'll come later.
- Where are you going?

194
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:15,458
You leave.

195
00:11:15,483 --> 00:11:17,522
Mom is starving there
and waiting for you

196
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:18,951
I'll talk to mom. You go home.

197
00:11:18,975 --> 00:11:21,231
- Dad will get upset.
- Like that's new!

198
00:11:21,255 --> 00:11:22,745
Go home and do your homework! Go!

199
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:25,639
Fine, okay -Like he's gonna study
and pass the exams! Rickshaw!

200
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:28,267
Zachariah colony -Please get in.

201
00:11:29,705 --> 00:11:31,109
- Panchaboodham travels building.
- Okay.

202
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:32,453
Take left, we'll take that route.

203
00:11:47,053 --> 00:11:48,534
Looks like a corpse is dancing.

204
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,053
- Stop!
- Enough!

205
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:53,150
Welcome Aravind.

206
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:55,698
When did the ship reach the shore?

207
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,308
Just half an hour ago.

208
00:11:57,441 --> 00:11:58,441
Greetings dear.

209
00:11:58,877 --> 00:12:02,895
I'm Thiruvalluvar district, Aaruni region,
Ammanambakkam councilor Punniyakotti.

210
00:12:02,926 --> 00:12:03,786
What do you want
me to do about it?

211
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,880
- This is my wife, Kaniyamma.
- Greetings.

212
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,942
That's my elder daughter, Malarvizhi.

213
00:12:08,062 --> 00:12:11,296
The girl with cat eye lenses is
my younger daughter, Kayalvizhi.

214
00:12:11,343 --> 00:12:11,843
Hi.

215
00:12:12,171 --> 00:12:15,085
Come on, dear. Saami is
getting married next week.

216
00:12:15,296 --> 00:12:17,822
And look at you! Looking sad
with that beard and long hairs.

217
00:12:17,846 --> 00:12:19,583
Granny, that's style.
You won't understand.

218
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,630
Grandma, quiet!

219
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:23,507
Who is this fellow who talks
about style in a sad manner?

220
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:24,577
Him?

221
00:12:24,992 --> 00:12:26,898
Saami's childhood friend.

222
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:29,127
He's returned from navy
to attend his wedding.

223
00:12:29,244 --> 00:12:31,084
- Where is Saami?
- Of course he is Saami (God)

224
00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:33,837
My nephew is like a God to me

225
00:12:34,197 --> 00:12:38,020
I had been begging him for three years
to marry my daughter, Malarvizhi.

226
00:12:38,136 --> 00:12:39,605
Finally he agreed to it now.

227
00:12:39,796 --> 00:12:42,958
If this marriage doesn't
take place, then I swear...

228
00:12:43,332 --> 00:12:44,410
Keep quiet for some time.

229
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:48,555
He is so happy about the engagement
that he paid the musicians extra,

230
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,532
and is dancing non-stop.

231
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,508
Don't mistake him, dear.

232
00:12:52,532 --> 00:12:53,899
- Brother...
- Brother?

233
00:12:54,102 --> 00:12:56,089
- He's always talking to me about...
- Who?

234
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:01,916
Obviously, Saami. He's keeps
talking about you round the clock.

235
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,138
You must be with us till the marriage
is over and bride send off is done.

236
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:06,344
First tell me where is Saami?

237
00:13:06,614 --> 00:13:09,317
Saami is waiting for
you in the terrace.

238
00:13:16,645 --> 00:13:18,270
Look! Exorcist ghost!

239
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,823
See, I was just pranking you

240
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,766
I've got lot of such ideas.
I'll share them with you.

241
00:13:24,321 --> 00:13:26,930
Oh! This business. I've lot
of contacts. I'll share it.

242
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,133
We don't need imported
liquors, dude.

243
00:13:29,913 --> 00:13:31,467
Let's unite with the nature,

244
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:33,827
and drink organic liquor.

245
00:13:34,491 --> 00:13:35,651
So, tell me what do you want?

246
00:13:36,006 --> 00:13:37,552
Rice toddy with dry fish semi gravy?

247
00:13:38,036 --> 00:13:40,217
Or prawn semi gravy with palm toddy?

248
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,468
For your marriage, for
your first night

249
00:13:42,562 --> 00:13:44,539
then for bride send off,
then for your honeymoon,

250
00:13:44,563 --> 00:13:45,766
and later when you
move to new house...

251
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,501
I wish you all the best.
Congratulations.

252
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:48,878
Are you joking?

253
00:13:49,464 --> 00:13:50,682
I made you my best man,

254
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:53,527
so that you'll be beside
me till wedding is over.

255
00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:55,509
But look at you talking
to me like some stranger.

256
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:56,081
No, dude...

257
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:57,979
I won't be around for your marriage.

258
00:13:58,611 --> 00:14:00,494
I've an important work. I'm leaving.

259
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:01,633
Bye.

260
00:14:01,853 --> 00:14:02,853
Hello!

261
00:14:03,618 --> 00:14:04,618
Wait.

262
00:14:07,426 --> 00:14:09,566
What's more important
than my wedding?

263
00:14:09,801 --> 00:14:12,621
Are you trying to lock horns with
me? Or trying to face off with me?

264
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:15,433
First, look at this!

265
00:14:17,302 --> 00:14:18,756
I and my friend...

266
00:14:19,017 --> 00:14:21,028
- On the same day...
- In the same hall...

267
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,177
At the same time...

268
00:14:22,223 --> 00:14:24,012
We will get married
in the same dais.

269
00:14:24,214 --> 00:14:26,847
- If that doesn't happen...
- We will never get married!

270
00:14:28,111 --> 00:14:29,619
You will get married
in four days,

271
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:33,757
and happily take
photos with your wife.

272
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,992
And you expect me to welcome
everyone to the reception?

273
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,877
And our friends will
spit on my face!

274
00:14:38,901 --> 00:14:41,541
On top of all this you promised to
pay 5 lakhs if we fail to do so!

275
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:45,162
Dude, what do you want me to do?

276
00:14:45,653 --> 00:14:46,153
Do one thing.

277
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:47,770
Call your uncle -Okay,

278
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:49,386
and postpone your
wedding for six months.

279
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,700
By then I'll find a girl for me.

280
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:52,840
Then let's get married in
the same dais as promised.

281
00:14:52,897 --> 00:14:54,965
Can you do this? Can you?

282
00:14:55,621 --> 00:14:58,801
So stop talking! Be happy!
May God bless you.

283
00:15:00,238 --> 00:15:04,225
My uncle's daughters; One is
Malarvizhi and one is Kayalvizhi.

284
00:15:04,256 --> 00:15:05,373
Third one is Vayalvizhi?

285
00:15:05,427 --> 00:15:07,358
Well, I don't know.
We must ask my uncle

286
00:15:07,451 --> 00:15:09,116
I am marrying Malarvizhi.

287
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,183
Kayalvizhi is more
beautiful that Malarvizhi.

288
00:15:12,826 --> 00:15:15,879
I'll talk to my uncle. Are
you okay with marrying her?

289
00:15:16,022 --> 00:15:18,489
You trying to sell me the unsold
goods in the market, isn't it?

290
00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:20,290
- God!
- I have a taste!

291
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,579
Dude, you haven't seen Kayalvizhi.

292
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:24,244
Wait a minute.

293
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,602
You'll be awestruck after
seeing her. Quite, don't talk.

294
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:27,320
One.. Two...

295
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:28,960
That's the AC remote!

296
00:15:29,213 --> 00:15:30,884
I know. It's mine!
What's your problem?

297
00:15:32,282 --> 00:15:34,625
Punniyakotti! Bring the girls, uncle

298
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:36,337
I guess he was eavesdropping.
He'll come now.

299
00:15:36,361 --> 00:15:37,361
Sorry, door!

300
00:15:37,407 --> 00:15:39,538
Why are you apologizing
to the door, dad?

301
00:15:44,507 --> 00:15:46,008
Did you call me, dear?

302
00:15:47,336 --> 00:15:47,942
What is it?

303
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,500
She is beautiful with dimple
in her cheeks. Do you like her?

304
00:15:51,413 --> 00:15:53,600
You're getting married in four
days. Don't get drunk and spoil it.

305
00:15:53,624 --> 00:15:55,398
- You think I'm blabbing?
- How will agree to it?

306
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:56,562
Be practical!

307
00:15:56,641 --> 00:15:58,579
To hell with this practi...
Wait a minute.

308
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:00,383
Girls, please leave.

309
00:16:00,672 --> 00:16:02,407
Uncle, you're a boy. Wait.

310
00:16:02,469 --> 00:16:02,969
Honey!

311
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,413
Don't drink too much

312
00:16:04,475 --> 00:16:06,874
- I won't, dear.
- We're getting married in four days.

313
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:10,550
What a cringe fest!

314
00:16:10,593 --> 00:16:13,254
- Cut his friendship.
- I don't know him. Get lost!

315
00:16:13,426 --> 00:16:14,609
Don't you spoil me!

316
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,602
Darling, you go to bed. I'll
take care of him. You go.

317
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:20,241
I asked him to check out the sister
and he's checking out my girl!

318
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:22,088
Honey send him off and come soon

319
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,573
- I'll be waiting downstairs.
- Okay, darling. Good night

320
00:16:24,807 --> 00:16:27,783
I was quiet because ladies were
here. Now I won't stop myself.

321
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,180
Words won't make you understand.

322
00:16:29,524 --> 00:16:31,671
Uncle, come here -Okay.

323
00:16:32,803 --> 00:16:35,077
Move or he might draw on your
bald head thinking it's the floor.

324
00:16:35,101 --> 00:16:36,163
Shut up!

325
00:16:37,154 --> 00:16:38,631
Cross that line -Why?

326
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,987
Just cross it, I'll tell you.

327
00:16:40,861 --> 00:16:43,247
Cross that side. Now this side

328
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:44,408
I crossed the line. Now, what?

329
00:16:44,432 --> 00:16:46,533
Don't show off. Now watch this.

330
00:16:46,893 --> 00:16:49,269
Uncle, now cross that line.

331
00:16:50,206 --> 00:16:51,206
Dear...

332
00:16:53,028 --> 00:16:55,926
I know you're testing
me because I'm drunk.

333
00:16:56,253 --> 00:17:00,194
Ravanan crossed a line with Ram which
is why Hanuman kidnapped himself.

334
00:17:00,745 --> 00:17:03,665
I will never cross the
line with my son-in-law.

335
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,885
See that? That's maternal
uncle love for you.

336
00:17:05,914 --> 00:17:08,439
He's so drunk that he's giving
wrong facts about Ramayanam!

337
00:17:08,479 --> 00:17:10,283
And you're boasting
about his love for you?

338
00:17:10,307 --> 00:17:11,254
You won't understand.

339
00:17:11,324 --> 00:17:14,325
Uncle, do one thing. Postpone
the wedding for six months.

340
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,161
Let my friend find a
suitable girl first.

341
00:17:16,194 --> 00:17:19,422
Then we both will get married on the
same day and in the same dais. Okay?

342
00:17:19,597 --> 00:17:21,527
All okay, dude. There, I did as you said.

343
00:17:22,489 --> 00:17:24,223
Why are you crying
without shedding tears?

344
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,403
Shut up!

345
00:17:26,551 --> 00:17:27,309
Why are you crying?

346
00:17:27,417 --> 00:17:28,535
Dear

347
00:17:28,646 --> 00:17:32,026
all arrangements are done. Invitations
are printed and distributed

348
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,846
I've purchased everything
for the wedding.

349
00:17:34,149 --> 00:17:37,777
If you ask me to postpone it now, then
what will happen to my reputation?

350
00:17:37,844 --> 00:17:40,152
I just asked you to postpone it.

351
00:17:40,196 --> 00:17:42,752
If you show off like this
then I'll stop the wedding.

352
00:17:42,971 --> 00:17:44,978
Please no, dear -Then leave

353
00:17:45,002 --> 00:17:46,900
I will obey you.

354
00:17:47,227 --> 00:17:47,993
Come on, dude!

355
00:17:48,094 --> 00:17:50,430
Shut up! Stop making freaky
noises and go downstairs.

356
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,570
I said, go!

357
00:17:52,085 --> 00:17:54,492
Uncle, don't get emotional
and hang yourself.

358
00:17:54,766 --> 00:17:58,484
Even if I live for five minutes,
I'll live with pride and valour.

359
00:17:58,718 --> 00:18:00,568
Go downstairs and do that.

360
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,954
Do you have sense? Are you nuts?

361
00:18:04,195 --> 00:18:06,446
- Stop behaving like fool!
- Dude...

362
00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:09,018
I don't listen to my
brain, like everybody else.

363
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:10,800
I listen to my heart.

364
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,619
Once I make up my mind

365
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:16,151
Not even Solomon Pappaiah
can change my mind.

366
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:18,851
Dude, it's celebration time!
Here, take it.

367
00:18:21,195 --> 00:18:22,891
Cheers!

368
00:18:26,013 --> 00:18:27,725
- Shanthi!
- Coming!

369
00:18:29,656 --> 00:18:30,656
Shanthi...

370
00:18:32,507 --> 00:18:33,507
How long?

371
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:43,350
- What's this?
- Dosai for breakfast.

372
00:18:46,624 --> 00:18:47,624
Hold on.

373
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:48,801
Aakash...

374
00:18:49,185 --> 00:18:51,201
That gas bill, EB
bill, cable bill,

375
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:54,357
- and the mobile bill. Pay them online.
- Already done, dad.

376
00:18:57,646 --> 00:18:58,670
What are you waiting for?

377
00:18:59,068 --> 00:19:00,568
You asked me to wait.

378
00:19:04,837 --> 00:19:06,726
Dosai must be like Dosai

379
00:19:07,483 --> 00:19:10,725
It must not be so thick
like Kal Dosai or Idly.

380
00:19:11,796 --> 00:19:13,460
How many times do I
tell this doofus?

381
00:19:13,828 --> 00:19:15,953
Around 3000 times you has said it.

382
00:19:17,453 --> 00:19:19,531
So you're doing it on purpose?

383
00:19:21,032 --> 00:19:22,032
Not like that...

384
00:19:22,191 --> 00:19:24,861
Depends on the pan. Sometime it's
crispy and sometimes it's not.

385
00:19:24,885 --> 00:19:26,136
What can I do about it?

386
00:19:28,062 --> 00:19:30,566
So you say the fault is
with the pan and not you?

387
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:34,050
The fault is mine.
I promise not to repeat it.

388
00:19:34,495 --> 00:19:35,972
I don't know when you'll learn.

389
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,160
Get lost!

390
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,328
Is his highness till sleeping
thinking that he's still in ship?

391
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:44,922
I don' know, dad. I woke up early
and started working on my project.

392
00:19:46,016 --> 00:19:47,016
Good.

393
00:19:47,714 --> 00:19:48,302
Mom...

394
00:19:48,784 --> 00:19:51,284
My head is aching. Please
make me a lemon tea.

395
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,870
Uh-oh! The danger is looking at me.

396
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:57,122
Mom, he would have
partied all night.

397
00:19:57,412 --> 00:19:59,606
He has an headache it seems.
He's asking for a lemon tea.

398
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,606
Why'd you do wrong translation from
Tamil to Tamil? She can hear me.

399
00:20:02,927 --> 00:20:04,948
Watching movie in the
laptop, right? Continue.

400
00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:08,659
Did you forget the house rules
after staying away for six months?

401
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:11,043
No, dad. I remember all the rules.

402
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,070
No one must eat when you're eating.

403
00:20:13,341 --> 00:20:15,043
Everyone must eat only
after you're done.

404
00:20:15,185 --> 00:20:17,162
No one must speak loud
when you're at home.

405
00:20:17,691 --> 00:20:19,225
No one must interrupt
when you're talking.

406
00:20:19,505 --> 00:20:20,896
You make the rules in this house.

407
00:20:21,005 --> 00:20:24,135
Anyone who stays here must
follow it or else must leave.

408
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,531
Are the rules correct?

409
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,339
Not bad

410
00:20:27,957 --> 00:20:29,425
you haven't forgotten the rules.

411
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,580
When I was in ship, I stand up
when I see your name in the call.

412
00:20:33,411 --> 00:20:35,427
Well, only then I'll
find some network range.

413
00:20:35,998 --> 00:20:36,794
Sit. Sit.

414
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,499
Then, six months you'll be jobless.
What's the plan?

415
00:20:43,883 --> 00:20:44,984
I'm not jobless, dad.

416
00:20:45,248 --> 00:20:47,702
I've decided to get married and
settled down within six months

417
00:20:48,061 --> 00:20:49,793
I've asked mom to
find me a bride.

418
00:20:50,355 --> 00:20:51,355
Yeah right!

419
00:20:51,437 --> 00:20:53,827
Look at my plight
after marrying her!

420
00:20:54,811 --> 00:20:55,811
Aakash

421
00:20:55,975 --> 00:20:58,850
show him the details of all the profiles
we chose for him in the matrimony site.

422
00:20:58,874 --> 00:20:59,991
Whoa!

423
00:21:00,021 --> 00:21:03,419
All the bride profiles are in a
slide show. Totally 72 profiles.

424
00:21:03,856 --> 00:21:04,856
Here

425
00:21:05,412 --> 00:21:06,622
72 profiles!

426
00:21:08,802 --> 00:21:10,587
I feel like choosing all of them!

427
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,972
Give me an hour's time, dad

428
00:21:13,052 --> 00:21:15,940
I'll check out the profiles, shortlist
them and note their ID number.

429
00:21:15,989 --> 00:21:17,527
Then you may choose
anyone out of them.

430
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,600
Wait.

431
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:20,420
Mom, I'm okay with
anyone you choose.

432
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:21,052
Sit down.

433
00:21:21,076 --> 00:21:21,982
Dad, the profiles...

434
00:21:22,076 --> 00:21:24,436
- Don't be restless. Sit down.
- Emotions of a 90s kid, dad.

435
00:21:25,379 --> 00:21:28,008
None of then out of
that 72 likes you.

436
00:21:29,013 --> 00:21:30,620
They all rejected you.

437
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:37,061
Why are such cringe
things happening to me?

438
00:21:38,273 --> 00:21:40,804
- Why mom, why?
- Poor boy.

439
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:43,300
They actually didn't reject you.

440
00:21:43,397 --> 00:21:45,692
It's because of your
profession they rejected you.

441
00:21:46,091 --> 00:21:49,390
You're six months on land
and six months on ship.

442
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,054
None of them are
ready to accept that.

443
00:21:52,531 --> 00:21:56,386
Don't worry. According to astrology,
your time is good starting next month.

444
00:21:56,444 --> 00:21:57,800
Don't worry, mommy is here.

445
00:21:58,405 --> 00:22:00,661
No matter what, you
won't find a bride.

446
00:22:01,411 --> 00:22:02,724
Either change your profession...

447
00:22:03,097 --> 00:22:04,004
Or else

448
00:22:04,302 --> 00:22:07,284
go along with her and find some
useless girl like her to marry.

449
00:22:07,294 --> 00:22:08,492
Get lost!

450
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,781
- Who does he think he is?
- Don't shout.

451
00:22:13,055 --> 00:22:14,392
Who does he think he is?

452
00:22:15,032 --> 00:22:16,435
Should I quit my
profession to get married?

453
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,139
Working in the navy was my ambition
since childhood. Don't you know?

454
00:22:19,597 --> 00:22:22,830
I knew it when you watched
Titanic so many times

455
00:22:22,947 --> 00:22:25,206
that you'll go and work in ship

456
00:22:25,297 --> 00:22:27,143
I didn't watch Titanic
because of the ship.

457
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:28,128
Then why did you watch it?

458
00:22:28,152 --> 00:22:29,229
There's a scene in that...

459
00:22:30,064 --> 00:22:31,567
Forget it. Can't say it.

460
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,339
My friend has postponed his
marriage for six months

461
00:22:34,392 --> 00:22:36,768
I must marry along with him.
Give me some idea.

462
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:39,373
Fine...

463
00:22:39,795 --> 00:22:41,764
Come with me to a place tomorrow.

464
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:43,652
Where?

465
00:22:44,658 --> 00:22:46,126
Just come with me. I'll tell you.

466
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:51,407
Here you go, ma'am.

467
00:22:51,664 --> 00:22:53,824
Her name is Shanthi. Open a
credit account in her name.

468
00:22:53,851 --> 00:22:55,615
- She'll come often and eat ice cream.
- Okay, sir.

469
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:57,858
Don't show off for buying
me this single ice cream

470
00:22:57,888 --> 00:22:58,966
I was kidding, mom.

471
00:22:58,990 --> 00:22:59,990
Bye -Bye, sir.

472
00:23:04,219 --> 00:23:05,219
Look at that girl.

473
00:23:06,002 --> 00:23:08,903
- Which one?
- The girl in white churidhar.

474
00:23:13,065 --> 00:23:13,963
Oh yeah!

475
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:15,438
She's very beautiful, isn't she?

476
00:23:17,456 --> 00:23:18,660
She's good -Yes, she is...

477
00:23:18,957 --> 00:23:20,457
But not up to my league.

478
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,199
Just joking.

479
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:23,527
She's good.

480
00:23:26,277 --> 00:23:27,397
Shall we go and talk to her?

481
00:23:27,953 --> 00:23:30,891
Mrs. Shanthi, do you realize
whose work you're doing?

482
00:23:31,641 --> 00:23:34,219
Well, when I've done a lot for you...
Come, let's go.

483
00:23:38,178 --> 00:23:39,467
Is anyone sitting here?

484
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:41,046
No.

485
00:23:41,256 --> 00:23:42,671
My legs are paining.
Can I sit here?

486
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:43,999
Please, sit down.

487
00:23:44,311 --> 00:23:45,311
Thanks.

488
00:23:47,403 --> 00:23:48,403
Watch me now.

489
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:52,313
What's your name, dear?

490
00:23:54,682 --> 00:23:55,682
Thulasi.

491
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:56,779
Thulasi.

492
00:23:57,294 --> 00:23:58,802
Thulasi it seems -I see. Okay.

493
00:24:00,412 --> 00:24:01,412
Are you studying?

494
00:24:02,638 --> 00:24:04,815
I've completed my studies.
I'm looking for a job now.

495
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:07,989
She'slooking for job it seems.

496
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,101
Are you married?

497
00:24:13,293 --> 00:24:14,293
No, auntie.

498
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,918
My family is looking for alliance.

499
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:20,489
Not married and they are
looking for alliance

500
00:24:20,515 --> 00:24:21,515
I can hear.

501
00:24:22,331 --> 00:24:23,331
Hello...

502
00:24:23,413 --> 00:24:24,097
Take it -Hello.

503
00:24:24,144 --> 00:24:25,144
What happened?

504
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:26,182
All set.

505
00:24:26,253 --> 00:24:27,432
Fine, we are ready

506
00:24:27,484 --> 00:24:28,484
I'll come.

507
00:24:29,684 --> 00:24:31,862
Okay, see you guys. Bye.

508
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:33,309
Bye.

509
00:24:34,676 --> 00:24:35,676
Bye.

510
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:38,870
Mom

511
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,537
she is mindblowing!

512
00:24:40,973 --> 00:24:42,387
The guy who'll marry
her is a lucky fellow.

513
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:44,827
Doofus! She didn't
bid goodbye to us

514
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,814
instead she left
this bag for you!

515
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:50,038
Go and give it to her.

516
00:24:50,241 --> 00:24:51,752
Let me have some -That's mine!

517
00:24:52,096 --> 00:24:53,096
Greedy!

518
00:24:57,156 --> 00:24:58,542
Where did she go?

519
00:25:01,046 --> 00:25:02,046
Hello!

520
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,127
Hello! Excuse me!

521
00:25:07,135 --> 00:25:08,486
You forgot your bag.

522
00:25:08,955 --> 00:25:10,882
So sorry. Thank you so much

523
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:13,156
I was in an important
call and forgot the bag.

524
00:25:13,225 --> 00:25:14,737
It's okay. It happens.

525
00:25:15,248 --> 00:25:16,826
Hi, I'm Aravind -Hi

526
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:20,138
I work in the navy. Six months I'm in
the sea and six months on the land.

527
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:21,379
What about you?

528
00:25:21,552 --> 00:25:23,802
I'm Thulasi. I'm jobless
throughout the year.

529
00:25:24,701 --> 00:25:26,151
I'm looking for a job.

530
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:29,269
You look very beautiful.

531
00:25:29,326 --> 00:25:30,967
- Just a minute.
- The moment I saw you...

532
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,197
Let me check if everything is
there in my bag -Please, go ahead.

533
00:25:34,931 --> 00:25:38,556
Thulasi! I've heard of traditional
name but this is a medicinal name.

534
00:25:38,987 --> 00:25:41,125
What's going to be there in
a jobless person's purse?

535
00:25:41,316 --> 00:25:41,816
Oh God!

536
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:42,656
It's gone!

537
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:45,084
What's gone? The zip?
Nothing to worry.

538
00:25:45,155 --> 00:25:48,115
Arun Maran's shop is near by. Come
let's go there and get it fixed.

539
00:25:48,182 --> 00:25:50,927
Not that! I had five
lakhs cash in my purse.

540
00:25:51,028 --> 00:25:52,434
It's missing -What?

541
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,675
Five lakhs cash is missing?

542
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,711
How can you be so irresponsible?

543
00:25:56,854 --> 00:25:59,547
No, I remember checking when
I was in the coffee shop.

544
00:26:00,062 --> 00:26:01,062
It was there back then.

545
00:26:01,976 --> 00:26:04,990
Did you take it while you were
on your way here to return it?

546
00:26:05,062 --> 00:26:07,264
Hello, what are you saying?

547
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:10,763
I helped you out of pity
and you're doubting me?

548
00:26:11,078 --> 00:26:12,787
You look like a good girl to me,

549
00:26:12,918 --> 00:26:14,746
yet why do you behave so
indecently in a public place?

550
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,497
You also look like
you're a decent boy,

551
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:18,564
but you stole five
lakhs in a jiffy!

552
00:26:19,048 --> 00:26:21,867
- How dare you talk like that?
- What now? Are you threatening me?

553
00:26:22,563 --> 00:26:23,563
What's your problem?

554
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:25,280
Come on! I thought you'll
end up getting her number

555
00:26:25,304 --> 00:26:26,436
instead you're getting scoldings!

556
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,919
Mom, it seems her money,
five lakhs is missing,

557
00:26:29,112 --> 00:26:30,674
- and she says I stole it.
- Oh God!

558
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:33,890
Oh! So that's your play?

559
00:26:34,124 --> 00:26:35,452
"Thaana serndha kootam" plot!

560
00:26:35,687 --> 00:26:37,937
You guys play mom and
son to steal money,

561
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,929
and now you're trying to escape?

562
00:26:39,968 --> 00:26:41,101
Since when you guys
have been doing this?

563
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:43,493
Talk too much and
I'll break your jaws!

564
00:26:43,731 --> 00:26:45,731
- Calm down, she's a girl.
- Mom, I don't need this

565
00:26:45,758 --> 00:26:46,946
I really dont' need this!

566
00:26:47,265 --> 00:26:49,937
If you wanted an ice cream you
could've got it near our home!

567
00:26:49,961 --> 00:26:52,372
Why bring me here and embarras
me? I'm off to the sea.

568
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,172
Hello, Mr. Pirates
of the Carribean.

569
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:55,798
You may go to the sea later.

570
00:26:55,845 --> 00:26:57,242
First, let's go to
the police station.

571
00:26:57,266 --> 00:26:58,688
Oh God! Police station?

572
00:26:59,016 --> 00:27:01,426
If my husband finds out,
he'll finish me off.

573
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,317
So you're okay with
cops beating me?

574
00:27:03,418 --> 00:27:04,699
But your husband must not find out!

575
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:05,723
Keep quiet.

576
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,309
My son won't commit such an act.
I promise.

577
00:27:10,192 --> 00:27:12,896
Do one thing. Take these and
see if you can compensate.

578
00:27:12,989 --> 00:27:14,778
Do you know any shop
where you can pledge it?

579
00:27:14,864 --> 00:27:17,264
Uh-oh, auntie I am so sorry.

580
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,817
We are doing a prank show for a
YouTube channel called TakeTwo.

581
00:27:19,841 --> 00:27:22,395
That's why I pranked you both.
Look at the camera over there.

582
00:27:23,707 --> 00:27:24,707
Come on, guys.

583
00:27:30,496 --> 00:27:32,088
We are going to be on TV!

584
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:35,062
I've seen many such programs in TV.

585
00:27:35,326 --> 00:27:38,015
Never thought I'd fall for it.

586
00:27:39,154 --> 00:27:41,212
She acts really well.

587
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:43,631
Not better than you mom.
Come home, I'll tell dad!

588
00:27:44,084 --> 00:27:45,553
Bro, chill bro!

589
00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:46,639
Bro?

590
00:27:48,301 --> 00:27:50,279
Don't you call me bro!

591
00:27:51,139 --> 00:27:52,139
Okay, Aravind.

592
00:27:52,683 --> 00:27:53,183
Auntie

593
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:56,839
look at the camera and say
"I dare to wear this hat".

594
00:27:58,746 --> 00:27:59,886
Mom, don't do it.

595
00:27:59,941 --> 00:28:00,941
Looks good?

596
00:28:02,541 --> 00:28:03,989
"Dare to wear this hat."

597
00:28:04,181 --> 00:28:06,260
Auntie, both of you together say it.

598
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,099
Looks like both of us
have to say it together

599
00:28:08,123 --> 00:28:09,935
I'll count to three and
then we'll say. Okay?

600
00:28:10,248 --> 00:28:11,654
One... two... three...

601
00:28:12,537 --> 00:28:14,856
"Dare to wear the hat,
I say to hell with that!"

602
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,918
She seems happy. Must
be blocking someone.

603
00:28:25,047 --> 00:28:26,055
What's wrong with you?

604
00:28:26,313 --> 00:28:28,508
We came early so that
we can solve your issue.

605
00:28:28,564 --> 00:28:29,588
But why are you so late?

606
00:28:29,807 --> 00:28:33,068
I'm wearing formals after a
long time. Took time to iron it.

607
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:36,365
Don't show off like a bride
getting ready for a wedding.

608
00:28:36,469 --> 00:28:37,469
- Bro...
- What?

609
00:28:37,505 --> 00:28:38,334
I'm stuck.

610
00:28:38,529 --> 00:28:40,889
Who's that? He looks like a
pregnant toad stuck in the clay.

611
00:28:42,606 --> 00:28:45,169
- Is he the victim?
- I'm not Victor. I'm Aravind.

612
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:48,317
No, sir. We address the affected
person as "victim" in our language.

613
00:28:48,348 --> 00:28:50,058
He talks as if English
is his mother tongue!

614
00:28:50,082 --> 00:28:52,653
Dude, who is he? He talks
like some kind of advocate.

615
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:55,861
Not 'Kind of advocate' but
he's an advocate who is a kind.

616
00:28:55,931 --> 00:28:58,642
Actually, I'm Madhusudhan. I've
shop outside the high court gate.

617
00:28:58,713 --> 00:28:59,841
Shop #48.

618
00:28:59,903 --> 00:29:03,049
We sell Andhra pickle, cereal powders,
garlice powder, ready made Chappathi

619
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:04,744
in fact we even
sell Idily batter.

620
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:06,751
Sir, I've a doubt about the Idly batter.

621
00:29:06,861 --> 00:29:10,151
Will you parcel it in a polythene bag
or should we bring a box from home?

622
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,416
- It'd be hygeinic if you bring the box.
- Shut up!

623
00:29:12,563 --> 00:29:15,548
I asked you to bring an advocate
and you bring me a hawker?

624
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:18,051
Dude, that was so wrong of you.

625
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:20,112
For seven generations they
are into food industry.

626
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:21,369
That's their main business.

627
00:29:21,622 --> 00:29:24,962
In order to help people like us,
he did his law course from YouTube

628
00:29:25,352 --> 00:29:27,798
I must blame myself
for asking your help!

629
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:29,134
I'm leaving -Buddy,

630
00:29:29,891 --> 00:29:31,213
so you don't trust me?

631
00:29:32,596 --> 00:29:35,166
Sir, tell two important law
points to make him understand.

632
00:29:35,204 --> 00:29:36,268
Watch me now!

633
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:39,385
A girl insulted you and your
mom in a public place, right?

634
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:41,080
He's got the point! Come on!

635
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,572
According to section...

636
00:29:44,611 --> 00:29:47,406
Just a minute, let me refer
YouTube and then tell you.

637
00:29:47,508 --> 00:29:49,820
Uh-oh! This fatso
is messing it up!

638
00:29:52,693 --> 00:29:54,512
Dude, he's playing Pokemon!

639
00:29:54,566 --> 00:29:56,269
Is he checking if he finds
any points through that?

640
00:29:56,293 --> 00:29:59,356
Sorry, there is no
strong 4G network here.

641
00:29:59,645 --> 00:30:02,324
If you don't mind, can you
get me the wifi password?

642
00:30:02,706 --> 00:30:03,581
Excuse me!

643
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:06,092
- Is that the password? All caps?
- That's not the password!

644
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:08,284
She's calling us to give an earful.
Come on now!

645
00:30:08,388 --> 00:30:09,161
- Lawyer!
- Yes?

646
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:10,388
Your time starts now!

647
00:30:10,412 --> 00:30:12,388
Fire!

648
00:30:13,255 --> 00:30:14,536
Where did you find this toad?

649
00:30:14,716 --> 00:30:16,684
Reduce the fire -Okay.

650
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:18,997
What can I do for you? Are
you guys waiting for someone?

651
00:30:19,161 --> 00:30:20,403
We need to meet your MD.

652
00:30:25,298 --> 00:30:26,298
I don't understand.

653
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:28,563
We both won't talk.

654
00:30:28,847 --> 00:30:30,641
The law will speak now.

655
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:31,899
Coming to the point.

656
00:30:32,055 --> 00:30:33,364
Your company staff Chembarathy...

657
00:30:33,388 --> 00:30:35,560
- Thulasi!
- Your company staff Thulasi

658
00:30:35,662 --> 00:30:37,897
has insulted my client,
Mr. Aravind, in public!

659
00:30:37,975 --> 00:30:40,199
According to the International
Penal Code of India...

660
00:30:41,804 --> 00:30:43,265
- What's the wifi password?
- What?

661
00:30:43,455 --> 00:30:44,858
All are small letters?

662
00:30:45,327 --> 00:30:46,327
You missed!

663
00:30:47,452 --> 00:30:48,561
This time I didn't miss!

664
00:30:48,608 --> 00:30:51,525
Go and sit on the huge
chair outside. Go!

665
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,540
This case is closed.

666
00:30:54,838 --> 00:30:55,838
You can proceed now.

667
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:58,845
VJ Thulasi who does "Dare to wear the
hat" program in your channel

668
00:30:58,947 --> 00:31:00,448
pranked us in a public place.

669
00:31:00,496 --> 00:31:03,143
Because of which we couldn't attend a
meeting and incurred loss of 30 crores.

670
00:31:03,167 --> 00:31:05,448
- Do you know the value of 30 crores?
- Dude, GST?

671
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,526
You look educated, add
the GST to it

672
00:31:07,963 --> 00:31:10,518
#1. That girl must apologize to
us here in front of everyone

673
00:31:11,057 --> 00:31:14,361
#2. Talk to your MD and
pay us the money we lost.

674
00:31:15,055 --> 00:31:16,561
Swag! Awesome dude!

675
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:19,961
Sir, we don't have anyone named
Thulasi working in our office.

676
00:31:20,048 --> 00:31:22,648
On top of that we don't do any
show called "Dare to wear the hat".

677
00:31:22,832 --> 00:31:24,340
Hello! What are you saying?

678
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:26,331
I know very well that she
works for your channel.

679
00:31:26,355 --> 00:31:28,434
- Sir, please listen to me...
- Are you kidding me?

680
00:31:28,614 --> 00:31:30,239
Why would I be kidding with you?

681
00:31:30,324 --> 00:31:33,578
You may look at the attendance list.
Nobody name Thulasi works here.

682
00:31:34,078 --> 00:31:35,445
What's going on, dude?

683
00:31:35,921 --> 00:31:37,828
Buddy, brace yourself.

684
00:31:39,445 --> 00:31:41,965
The prank that she played on you
that day is not the real prank.

685
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:45,255
This is the real prank
she has played on you!

686
00:31:45,543 --> 00:31:46,591
Now smile and say...

687
00:31:46,912 --> 00:31:48,779
"Dare to wear the hat."

688
00:31:49,585 --> 00:31:51,525
- Why are getting so upset for this?
- Hello, what are you doing?

689
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:53,530
Collect those papers and put
it back exactly how it was.

690
00:31:53,554 --> 00:31:54,794
Or else I'll call the security.

691
00:31:54,865 --> 00:31:57,156
How dare you order us to
collect those paper? Mind you!

692
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,859
Dude, move your foot.
Let me collect that.

693
00:31:59,018 --> 00:32:01,018
- Dude, come on now.
- You're stepping on it. Move.

694
00:32:03,186 --> 00:32:04,386
Dude, this is a reputed place.

695
00:32:04,725 --> 00:32:05,741
We must return home safe.

696
00:32:05,985 --> 00:32:06,985
So shut up and give it.

697
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,324
Even I'm a corporate employee.

698
00:32:09,355 --> 00:32:11,730
- MD of Panchaboodham travels.
- Dude!

699
00:32:12,148 --> 00:32:13,148
That's her!

700
00:32:13,474 --> 00:32:14,621
Thulasi Ramachandran.

701
00:32:14,903 --> 00:32:16,481
So she's not a VJ?

702
00:32:16,703 --> 00:32:18,295
She's trying for a VJ job.

703
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,634
Holy guacamole!

704
00:32:19,762 --> 00:32:21,839
I've seen people search
jobs to earn money.

705
00:32:21,925 --> 00:32:24,332
She's the first girl who has
spent money to get a job.

706
00:32:24,494 --> 00:32:26,128
She will definitely find a job.

707
00:32:26,457 --> 00:32:28,129
Dude, she looks beautful.

708
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,447
Take a photo.

709
00:32:29,612 --> 00:32:30,112
Wait.

710
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,355
A souvenier -I'll click it

711
00:32:32,497 --> 00:32:33,628
I'm sure you'd have cut my face.

712
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:36,252
Full of spelling mistakes. She
won't even get a house keeping job.

713
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:40,017
Dad your full name is Ramachandran.

714
00:32:40,136 --> 00:32:41,936
Your friends call you Rams.

715
00:32:42,565 --> 00:32:45,396
You completed your mechanical
engineering in 1984,

716
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:48,067
and joined navy in 1986.

717
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:49,850
Got married in 1992.

718
00:32:50,318 --> 00:32:51,857
Your daughter was born in 1999.

719
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,491
After your wife passed
away in 2001

720
00:32:54,811 --> 00:32:56,787
you took voluntary
retirement and now...

721
00:32:56,811 --> 00:32:58,146
I'm applying butter on the bread.

722
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:58,670
Dad!

723
00:32:58,857 --> 00:33:01,748
Like how they announce VIP's
passing away, in TV...

724
00:33:01,912 --> 00:33:03,091
You're reading out like that.

725
00:33:03,158 --> 00:33:05,556
Dad, I am creating a
wikipedia page for you.

726
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:08,517
I don't care if you create a page
in Wikipedia or Trickypedia...

727
00:33:08,541 --> 00:33:10,423
First tell me what happened
to your media job search?

728
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,758
Dad, I came up with a concept,

729
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,375
and sent my resume
to a news channel

730
00:33:14,632 --> 00:33:15,930
99% I'll get through.

731
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,171
- What if that 1% acts up?
- No problem...

732
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,785
I've applied at BBC Tamil. I'm
waiting for the interview call.

733
00:33:21,797 --> 00:33:23,742
If you get that job

734
00:33:23,867 --> 00:33:25,742
then I'll marry you
off to a nice guy,

735
00:33:25,976 --> 00:33:27,601
and I wander around
like a free bird.

736
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:30,651
I won't let you go
free at this old age.

737
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:33,286
Instead areyou going to put
me in an old age home?

738
00:33:33,482 --> 00:33:34,513
No, dad.

739
00:33:34,747 --> 00:33:36,669
What if out of the blue
you slip in bathroom?

740
00:33:37,131 --> 00:33:39,205
What if you get a chest
pain during midnight?

741
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:40,814
What if your sugar level shoots up?

742
00:33:41,026 --> 00:33:42,846
Who will be there to take
care of you at such times?

743
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,002
I think I'll have all of
that listening to you.

744
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,425
So are you going to be
with me round the clock?

745
00:33:47,451 --> 00:33:48,451
Dad

746
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:50,491
except me who else is there
to take care of you?

747
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:52,768
- What I'm saying is...
- No need, dad...

748
00:33:52,917 --> 00:33:56,006
You must live with me after my
wedding or else I won't marry at all.

749
00:33:56,162 --> 00:33:57,741
God! Nothing like that, dear.

750
00:33:59,654 --> 00:34:00,654
Dear!

751
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:04,732
Looks like she'll take me along and
make me her maid after her marriage.

752
00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:07,654
Hello.

753
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:10,875
Hey yo! This is Peter Parker
calling from BBC London.

754
00:34:11,075 --> 00:34:13,383

00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,637
Actually sir I've given
my passport for renewal.

758
00:34:22,806 --> 00:34:24,212
Could you give me
15 days of time?

759
00:34:24,252 --> 00:34:27,069
Ha! That's not an issue. Why
don't you come to Parrys?

760
00:34:27,282 --> 00:34:29,501
For Paris also we need passport.

761
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:32,701
Come on, Thulasi. I meant
Parrys corner, Chennai.

762
00:34:32,753 --> 00:34:36,780
We have a branch office there.
Opposite to Allaudin Atho shop.

763
00:34:36,896 --> 00:34:38,843
- Do you know that shop?
- Sorry, sir. I don't know.

764
00:34:38,867 --> 00:34:42,372

don't know Allaudin Atho shop?

00:34:42,446 --> 00:34:43,712
Sorry, sir. Sorry.

766

You know that mango matter
is very important in India.

816
00:36:49,635 --> 00:36:51,041
They eat it with salt

"Thumala katai."

824

Watch me handle it.

825
00:37:11,385 --> 00:37:14,613
- "Kadai on the stove" song.
- "Kadain on the stove?"

826
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,027
Don't know "Kadai on the stove"?
Then waste of time!

827
00:37:17,065 --> 00:37:18,426
- Go! Go!
- Sir!

828
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:19,831

00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:27,949
"My pockett is full
of money that I owe."

832
00:37:27,973 --> 00:37:29,442
"Vadivelu is in Dubai now"

833
00:37:29,503 --> 00:37:31,019
- "Flick..."
- Stop! Stop!

834
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:33,230
Why are you reading? I know lyric

835
00:37:33,395 --> 00:37:35,553
I want you to sing. Sing!

836
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,855
"Kadai on the stove."

837
00:37:39,902 --> 00:37:41,175
"My pockett is full
of money that I owe."

838
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,535
"Vadivelu is in Dubai now."

839
00:37:42,577 --> 00:37:43,765
"Flick it, oh wow!"

840
00:37:43,823 --> 00:37:45,407
"If you're from the same
local you may prank."

841
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:46,791
"Don't care if it's Tom or Frank."

842
00:37:46,956 --> 00:37:48,449
"Just another naughty boy."

843
00:37:48,473 --> 00:37:49,932
"So prank him and
play like he's a toy."

844
00:37:49,956 --> 00:37:52,995
Wow! What a song you've sung.

845
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:56,684
Song is good but the
pitch wasn't up to mark.

846
00:37:57,035 --> 00:37:58,915
If you hold your breath
and sing, it'll be fine.

847
00:37:59,216 --> 00:38:01,114
Okay, leve two clear.

848
00:38:02,621 --> 00:38:05,355
Okay, you've cleared the level two.
Come on!

849
00:38:05,535 --> 00:38:08,293
Now Thulasi you're in the third
stage. It's very crucial.

850
00:38:08,527 --> 00:38:10,773
Here you've to perform
a dance for the kids.

852
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:14,477
Death Punch?

853
00:38:14,515 --> 00:38:17,086
Death punch means the
dance during the death.

854
00:38:18,016 --> 00:38:20,676
- You can dance now. Come on.
- Sir, here?

855
00:38:21,288 --> 00:38:23,405
Don't know, right? Then
there is no job, go!

856
00:38:23,546 --> 00:38:26,272
- No job! Please go out!
- No, sir! I'll do.

857
00:38:26,499 --> 00:38:27,499
Then perform.

858
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,656
Start!

859
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:44,420
Than was an awesome dance, girl.

860
00:38:44,444 --> 00:38:46,161
One of my sick aunt will
pass away tomorrow, I guess.

861
00:38:46,185 --> 00:38:48,929
Why don't you come and dance there.
I'll give you a good payement.

862
00:38:49,725 --> 00:38:50,725
Who are you guys?

863
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:53,700
I'm this channel's owner.
Look at my ID card. Catch!

864
00:38:54,497 --> 00:38:56,103
Tell me the truth or
I'll call the police!

865
00:38:56,127 --> 00:38:58,447
Call them. There is lot of space
here. Let them also dance.

866
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,573
It's burning! It's burning!

867
00:39:08,651 --> 00:39:10,299
Aravindha!

868
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:13,226
"Appa Rao, Suppa Rao,
Kareena Kappor uh?"

869
00:39:13,382 --> 00:39:16,148
"Water's so costly that they
sell it for thirty rupees oh!"

870
00:39:16,202 --> 00:39:19,444
What's up, Thulasi?
Something is missing.

871
00:39:20,373 --> 00:39:21,390
What could it be?

872
00:39:22,577 --> 00:39:23,772
I got it! Got it!

873
00:39:24,146 --> 00:39:25,448
"Kadai on the stove."

874
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:26,747
"If you're from the same
local you may prank."

875
00:39:26,771 --> 00:39:28,076
"Vadivelu is in Dubai now."

876
00:39:28,102 --> 00:39:29,523
"You too got pranked now."

877
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:31,701
Now you look so graceful!

878
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:34,702
Same hat but guess
what, I washed it.

879
00:39:35,436 --> 00:39:36,772
Now say it out loud...

880
00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:38,607
"Dare to wear the hat!"

881
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:42,247
Ready? One... Two... Three...

882
00:39:42,497 --> 00:39:43,497
Start!

883
00:39:44,771 --> 00:39:46,771
Leaving so soon? I thought
I'll have some more fun.

884
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:48,943
Take this hat. It'll come
handy during Christmas.

885
00:39:50,029 --> 00:39:51,069
Oh God! It's burning.

886
00:39:51,115 --> 00:39:53,266
Dude you look like the
dog doll in Naidu hall.

887
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:55,637
It's because of her. Dude

888
00:39:55,661 --> 00:39:57,301
to take revenge on that girl...

889
00:39:57,364 --> 00:40:03,231
I brought this Ghajini Ganesh and Sarkar
Sarath from Mahabalipuram in rickshaw.

890
00:40:03,324 --> 00:40:05,457
That rickshaw rent, plus
three coats rent

891
00:40:05,598 --> 00:40:09,215
this building rent and
their heavy food expenses

892
00:40:09,405 --> 00:40:11,844
put together comes
to 20, 492 rupees.

893
00:40:11,953 --> 00:40:13,938
Take a discount of
492 rupees and

894
00:40:14,258 --> 00:40:16,008
pay me a round figure of 20,000

895
00:40:16,078 --> 00:40:17,998
then we shall settle the
bill and leave. Come on.

896
00:40:18,032 --> 00:40:20,261
Dude, you should spend
for your marriage.

897
00:40:20,565 --> 00:40:22,323
Money is not a matter.
Don't be such a miser.

898
00:40:22,347 --> 00:40:24,394
Guys, don't leave me. Get
the money or rough him up.

899
00:40:25,675 --> 00:40:28,908
Where are you off to? Did you mistake
me for a Chinese seeing my flat nose?

900
00:40:28,992 --> 00:40:29,992
Thulasi!

901
00:40:31,101 --> 00:40:32,101
Wait.

902
00:40:32,444 --> 00:40:34,398
You pranked me and I
pranked you in return.

903
00:40:34,623 --> 00:40:36,608
Now we're even. Friends?

904
00:40:37,754 --> 00:40:38,370
Come on

905
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,184
I pranked you just for fun.

906
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:43,043
But you pranked me with my
profession and insulted me!

907
00:40:43,246 --> 00:40:44,246
I'll never forgive you.

908
00:40:44,879 --> 00:40:46,934
Why are you blowing
up such a petty issue?

909
00:40:46,992 --> 00:40:47,992
A petty issue?

910
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,608
Insulting me in front of everyone
is a petty issue for you?

911
00:40:50,654 --> 00:40:51,654
I agree it's wrong

912
00:40:51,694 --> 00:40:52,366
I'm sorry

913
00:40:52,482 --> 00:40:53,529
I'm very sorry.

914
00:40:53,765 --> 00:40:54,976
To hell with your sorry.

915
00:40:55,825 --> 00:40:56,825
Thulasi!

916
00:40:56,989 --> 00:40:57,989
I'm sorry!

917
00:40:58,477 --> 00:41:00,524
Stage 1-Clear!

918
00:41:21,577 --> 00:41:26,530
"Hey girl, I'm a poor little boy."

919
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:31,155
"So please don't play inky
ponky and toy with this boy."

920
00:41:31,498 --> 00:41:36,476
"Hey girl, I'm a silent cute boy."

921
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:40,718
"Please hear my heart and it
keeps calling out to you."

922
00:41:40,772 --> 00:41:42,139
"You sparked up my heart."

923
00:41:43,264 --> 00:41:45,257
"It's burning with love."

924
00:41:45,749 --> 00:41:47,593
"Please put out the fire."

925
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:50,702
"Will you do it for me?"

926
00:41:50,874 --> 00:41:52,663
"Oh my dear..."

927
00:41:53,397 --> 00:41:54,983
"You don't feel my pain."

928
00:41:55,788 --> 00:41:57,866
"In short..."

929
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:00,763
"You ain't that swag."

930
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:13,803
"I am very sorry, forgive me."

931
00:42:14,022 --> 00:42:16,319
"Let's have some
snacks, feed me dear."

932
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:21,363
"Everytime I see you,
my heart sings a song!"

933
00:42:21,504 --> 00:42:26,350
"I want to pamper you
life long, baby"

934
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:30,558
"I promise to never cheat
on you with your friend."

935
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:36,235
"You're are turning
me into a lover boy"

936
00:42:36,438 --> 00:42:40,821
"I am the great poer Bharathi in modern
jeans. Let me sing and prove it."

937
00:42:40,962 --> 00:42:43,189
"You sparked up my heart."

938
00:42:43,251 --> 00:42:45,868
"It's burning with love."

939
00:42:45,922 --> 00:42:48,342
"Please put out the fire."

940
00:42:48,389 --> 00:42:51,444
"Will you do it for me?"

941
00:42:51,482 --> 00:42:52,626
"Oh my dear..."

942
00:42:53,248 --> 00:42:54,725
"You don't feel my pain."

943
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,704
"In short..."

944
00:42:58,274 --> 00:43:00,110
"You ain't that swag."

945
00:43:34,042 --> 00:43:38,206
"You are all I see in my dreams."

946
00:43:38,901 --> 00:43:43,079
"And I dream about is
you, every single day."

947
00:43:43,766 --> 00:43:48,782
"My heart bursts like a
popcorn, just for you."

948
00:43:48,933 --> 00:43:54,029
"You are pushing me away
and making me desperate."

949
00:43:54,108 --> 00:43:58,819
"Oh my dear... You beauty..."

950
00:43:58,982 --> 00:44:01,463
"You're so beautiful that..."

951
00:44:01,487 --> 00:44:03,557
"Its like tasting ice
cream in my dream."

952
00:44:03,581 --> 00:44:04,917
"You sparked up my heart."

953
00:44:05,729 --> 00:44:07,464
"It's burning with love."

954
00:44:08,198 --> 00:44:10,182
"Please put out the fire."

955
00:44:10,783 --> 00:44:13,119
"Will you do it for me?"

956
00:44:13,268 --> 00:44:14,651
"Oh my dear..."

957
00:44:15,713 --> 00:44:17,166
"You don't feel my pain."

958
00:44:18,283 --> 00:44:20,080
"In short..."

959
00:44:20,798 --> 00:44:23,119
"You ain't that swag."

960
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,231
"I am very sorry,
please forgive me."

961
00:44:26,378 --> 00:44:28,636
"Let's have some
snacks, feed me dear."

962
00:44:28,872 --> 00:44:33,746
"Everytime I see you,
my heart sings a song!"

963
00:45:20,852 --> 00:45:21,468
Shanthi!

964
00:45:25,258 --> 00:45:25,860
Shanthi!

965
00:45:58,484 --> 00:45:59,641
Good evening Mr. Natraj!

966
00:46:00,075 --> 00:46:01,412
Been knocking for too long

967
00:46:01,766 --> 00:46:03,804
Shanthi ma'am is not
opening, is it?

968
00:46:03,906 --> 00:46:07,054
That's why am standing
outside, Krishanan kutty

969
00:46:07,225 --> 00:46:09,749
Last week an incident happened
in Injambakkam

970
00:46:09,928 --> 00:46:13,442
Just like this, a lady locked herself
up and did not open for two hours

971
00:46:13,593 --> 00:46:15,286
The police came and broke in...

972
00:46:15,477 --> 00:46:17,262
only to find her hanging
from the ceiling fan

973
00:46:17,318 --> 00:46:18,412
You idiot!

974
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:20,228
Shut your mouth and
mind your business!

975
00:46:20,434 --> 00:46:23,266
Flaunting your paunch and
spreading rumours every evening!

976
00:46:23,757 --> 00:46:24,390
Get lost!

977
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:25,735
Omanakutty!

978
00:46:26,087 --> 00:46:28,040
Make some tea for me. Make it black

979
00:46:34,215 --> 00:46:34,715
Shanthi!

980
00:46:36,941 --> 00:46:37,722
Look here

981
00:46:39,228 --> 00:46:39,955
Over here!

982
00:46:40,784 --> 00:46:41,284
Shanthi!

983
00:46:43,347 --> 00:46:44,253
Look here!

984
00:46:44,956 --> 00:46:46,917
Shanthi! Look here!

985
00:46:53,488 --> 00:46:54,154
Shanthi!

986
00:46:58,001 --> 00:46:59,657
I will rip your ear
if I come inside

987
00:47:00,704 --> 00:47:01,204
Get lost!

988
00:47:14,678 --> 00:47:17,529
I was busy. That's why
couldn't attend your call

989
00:47:17,647 --> 00:47:19,397
Tell me! Have you left from office?

990
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:21,233
Shanthi madam!

991
00:47:22,084 --> 00:47:24,610
Is your music and dance
performance over?

992
00:47:24,626 --> 00:47:27,040
If so, can you please open the door

993
00:47:27,126 --> 00:47:29,313
-Oh my! I am coming right away
-Come madam!

994
00:47:43,954 --> 00:47:45,282
Sorry!

995
00:47:45,664 --> 00:47:48,766
I was a bit upset, so
for mind relaxation...

996
00:47:49,977 --> 00:47:52,868
I was practicing singing...

997
00:47:54,202 --> 00:47:57,180
So immense that you would
forget your family

998
00:47:57,703 --> 00:47:58,946
It's not like that

999
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,173
I thought you would be late

1000
00:48:02,501 --> 00:48:04,931
So I started practicing

1001
00:48:05,164 --> 00:48:06,967
You think yourself as sweet
singer Chitra?

1002
00:48:07,411 --> 00:48:09,249
Are you going to judge singing
competitions in TV?

1003
00:48:09,631 --> 00:48:11,295
You and your singing, my foot!

1004
00:48:14,115 --> 00:48:15,006
Thank God!

1005
00:48:15,428 --> 00:48:17,561
You were wearing headphones
and singing quietly

1006
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:20,382
If you had sung out
loud with a microphone...

1007
00:48:20,412 --> 00:48:23,312
our neighbour Krishnankutty's
90 year old mom...

1008
00:48:23,561 --> 00:48:24,843
would have drop down dead

1009
00:48:25,492 --> 00:48:26,285
Do we need it?

1010
00:48:28,284 --> 00:48:28,854
Think!

1011
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:33,886
God has given a talent
to every individual

1012
00:48:35,205 --> 00:48:36,250
But for you...

1013
00:48:36,634 --> 00:48:38,028
He has given none

1014
00:48:38,603 --> 00:48:41,998
That is why you are confined
only to the kitchen...

1015
00:48:42,435 --> 00:48:44,450
and living a luxurious
life as a home maker

1016
00:48:46,551 --> 00:48:53,683
If you become over zealous and start with
your singing and feminist ideals again

1017
00:48:54,029 --> 00:48:55,971
I will chuck you out!

1018
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:59,080
Sorry I did that

1019
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:02,103
Won't happen again

1020
00:49:04,651 --> 00:49:07,088
I'll serve food if you are ready

1021
00:49:07,915 --> 00:49:08,415
Get lost!

1022
00:49:12,253 --> 00:49:13,229
Disgusting!

1023
00:49:23,784 --> 00:49:26,683
Haven’t I told you to fill the
bottles and keep them in the fridge

1024
00:49:26,942 --> 00:49:28,020
Why are you not listening?

1025
00:49:31,496 --> 00:49:31,996
Mom?

1026
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:37,664
Still pondering over his scoldings?

1027
00:49:39,844 --> 00:49:42,972
I thought this issue would prolong
for days like a cricket test match

1028
00:49:43,589 --> 00:49:46,057
But ended soon like a
twenty twenty match

1029
00:49:46,597 --> 00:49:47,753
You are so lucky!

1030
00:49:48,831 --> 00:49:50,088
Why are you still crying?

1031
00:49:50,245 --> 00:49:52,835
Is getting scoldings from
him a new thing to you?

1032
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:56,294
This is happening for
as long as I remember

1033
00:49:57,712 --> 00:49:58,811
It's not that

1034
00:49:59,249 --> 00:50:02,424
He keeps scolding me
like this all the time

1035
00:50:02,776 --> 00:50:04,049
He embarrasses me

1036
00:50:04,604 --> 00:50:06,409
I don't care about that

1037
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:08,704
I got used to all that

1038
00:50:10,028 --> 00:50:10,661
But...

1039
00:50:10,982 --> 00:50:16,427
He told me that Krishnan kutty's 90
year old mom would die if I sing

1040
00:50:16,834 --> 00:50:19,037
That was really insulting

1041
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:21,786
You tell me!

1042
00:50:21,895 --> 00:50:24,153
Is my singing so bad?

1043
00:50:24,677 --> 00:50:25,177
Mom!

1044
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:27,122
Till my 5th grade

1045
00:50:27,411 --> 00:50:28,841
You would sing and make me sleep

1046
00:50:28,842 --> 00:50:31,748
If your voice is as
horrible as he says

1047
00:50:31,904 --> 00:50:35,065
I would have told you not to sing
and slept by myself right?

1048
00:50:35,973 --> 00:50:40,284
Are you saying that
I sing well or not?

1049
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,440
Well I...

1050
00:50:42,257 --> 00:50:42,915
One second

1051
00:50:46,314 --> 00:50:47,790
-Yeah!
-They are showing Baasha movie

1052
00:50:47,923 --> 00:50:49,892
-Really?
-Yeah! In K TV

1053
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,868
-Are you serious?
-Come quick, It just started just

1054
00:50:51,891 --> 00:50:52,828
I will be there at once

1055
00:50:53,603 --> 00:50:54,706
What happened?

1056
00:50:55,017 --> 00:50:56,010
Better not tell you

1057
00:50:56,659 --> 00:50:58,674
-What happened?
-You don't have to hear it

1058
00:50:58,721 --> 00:51:00,573
You are scaring me.
Tell what happened

1059
00:51:02,995 --> 00:51:04,909
Krishnan kutty's old mom...

1060
00:51:05,867 --> 00:51:06,422
Died!

1061
00:51:06,461 --> 00:51:08,980
Oh God!

1062
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,182
Your father's words came true!

1063
00:51:12,299 --> 00:51:15,646
How am I going to face them again?

1064
00:51:16,378 --> 00:51:17,673
Mom! I was just kidding

1065
00:51:18,032 --> 00:51:19,805
That lady won't die so easy

1066
00:51:20,071 --> 00:51:22,321
They are playing Baasha
movie again in K TV

1067
00:51:22,506 --> 00:51:24,453
Akash called me! I am going now

1068
00:51:25,737 --> 00:51:27,272
Mom! Stop!

1069
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:31,802
As usual, you have shown your
anger towards dad on me

1070
00:51:32,671 --> 00:51:34,874
-It' alright! Sleep well!
-Sorry!

1071
00:51:35,256 --> 00:51:37,038
-I don't need your sorry
-Sorry! My precious

1072
00:51:37,077 --> 00:51:38,717
No need for anything

1073
00:51:38,905 --> 00:51:39,821
Get lost!

1074
00:51:40,952 --> 00:51:43,233
That old lady is going to
die because of you someday

1075
00:51:51,716 --> 00:51:52,574
Who are you people?

1076
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:55,154
From Thiruvallur district, Aaruni town,
Amanambakkam village

1077
00:51:55,217 --> 00:51:56,967
I am councilor Punniyakotti
adorning a fine head band

1078
00:51:57,045 --> 00:51:59,295
I am his elder daughter Malarvizhi
with a worship plate

1079
00:51:59,357 --> 00:52:01,800
I am his younger daughter
Kayalvizhi with a milk pot

1080
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:04,034
Who cares? What do you people want?

1081
00:52:04,081 --> 00:52:08,097
The navy guy Aravind from this house has
played games in my daughters lives

1082
00:52:08,122 --> 00:52:12,433
I have came from Amanampakkam in auto
rickshaw to get a promise from your son

1083
00:52:12,496 --> 00:52:14,619
Driver! Stop kissing the
phone and wait for us

1084
00:52:14,893 --> 00:52:16,534
Would he like to promise on
this holy flame?

1085
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,532
Or promise on this fresh milk pot?

1086
00:52:18,595 --> 00:52:20,359
Else ask him promise
on my sacred blanket

1087
00:52:20,383 --> 00:52:21,938
You're talking about my son?

1088
00:52:22,235 --> 00:52:23,694
What nonsense are you talking?

1089
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:26,286
Being fair skinned doesn't mean you
can blabber anything in English

1090
00:52:26,321 --> 00:52:27,046
Rightly said!

1091
00:52:27,091 --> 00:52:29,179
Look! He has cheated my daughters

1092
00:52:29,257 --> 00:52:31,366
It's been a month since
he accepted for the marriage

1093
00:52:31,367 --> 00:52:32,406
He is absconding since

1094
00:52:32,444 --> 00:52:34,499
We are not leaving without an answer today.
What do you say?

1095
00:52:34,581 --> 00:52:35,081
Right Dad!

1096
00:52:35,143 --> 00:52:37,127
Slow down and breath or you may die

1097
00:52:37,128 --> 00:52:39,753
Is she your wife?
I am councilor Puniyakotti

1098
00:52:39,861 --> 00:52:40,517
Greetings brother!

1099
00:52:40,589 --> 00:52:41,667
This woman knows respect!

1100
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,210
Why are the guests
waiting outside?

1101
00:52:45,236 --> 00:52:46,333
What should we do then?

1102
00:52:46,777 --> 00:52:49,225
Shall we treat them to a feast

1103
00:52:49,904 --> 00:52:50,985
It's not that

1104
00:52:51,318 --> 00:52:54,248
I heard they have some
complaints about our son

1105
00:52:54,428 --> 00:52:57,350
Better to discuss it inside

1106
00:52:57,553 --> 00:53:00,545
Who raised that son of yours?

1107
00:53:01,403 --> 00:53:02,121
Tell me who?

1108
00:53:02,819 --> 00:53:03,514
Me!

1109
00:53:03,702 --> 00:53:05,077
Everyone should know it right?

1110
00:53:05,445 --> 00:53:06,593
Let's discuss it on the road

1111
00:53:07,069 --> 00:53:09,225
Let's find if this teaches a lesson
to you and your son

1112
00:53:09,623 --> 00:53:11,491
-Go! Bring your son
-Let's go inside

1113
00:53:11,591 --> 00:53:12,935
Hey! You wait here!

1114
00:53:13,187 --> 00:53:14,257
All of you wait here

1115
00:53:14,648 --> 00:53:15,539
I'll be back

1116
00:53:15,686 --> 00:53:16,186
Okay!

1117
00:53:16,725 --> 00:53:18,046
What is he saying in English?

1118
00:53:18,381 --> 00:53:21,156
He is asking us to remove our footwear and
come inside. I know enough English

1119
00:53:21,172 --> 00:53:22,965
The house seems good. Let's inherit
it after the marriage

1120
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:24,770
It's been only a month since we came here

1121
00:53:25,441 --> 00:53:26,550
He has played with two girls

1122
00:53:27,096 --> 00:53:28,466
That too local ones from village

1123
00:53:29,433 --> 00:53:30,126
Well done!

1124
00:53:30,932 --> 00:53:32,431
Congratulations Mrs. Shanthi!

1125
00:53:33,071 --> 00:53:34,431
You have raised you son well

1126
00:53:34,767 --> 00:53:38,064
Forgive me! This won't happen again

1127
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,134
Again? What are you trying to say?

1128
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:42,196
Are you saying let's have one more
child and you'll raise it properly?

1129
00:53:42,267 --> 00:53:43,893
Oh my! I didn't mean that

1130
00:53:43,932 --> 00:53:46,426
Enough! Call your son

1131
00:53:46,721 --> 00:53:47,995
Aravind! Come here

1132
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:50,135
-Don't shout, I am here
-Here he is

1133
00:53:53,932 --> 00:53:56,768
You have ruined the lives of
two village girls

1134
00:53:56,895 --> 00:53:58,284
What? Me?

1135
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,496
What is happening?

1136
00:53:59,567 --> 00:54:02,888
Who is that Punniyakotti who has
brought his daughters

1137
00:54:03,175 --> 00:54:04,606
Punniyakotti!

1138
00:54:04,716 --> 00:54:06,201
That frying pan head!

1139
00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:07,607
Mom! I have told you right

1140
00:54:07,793 --> 00:54:09,974
He is my friend Saaminathan's
maternal uncle

1141
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:13,115
We decided to marry
on the same time

1142
00:54:13,185 --> 00:54:15,568
So he postponed his marriage with
his uncle's daughter

1143
00:54:15,825 --> 00:54:17,693
He is here to fight for that

1144
00:54:17,873 --> 00:54:19,447
I will crack his head open

1145
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:23,401
-Mom! Explain it to dad
-I would explain

1146
00:54:23,744 --> 00:54:24,995
I knew about it

1147
00:54:25,353 --> 00:54:28,274
-Do you believe what he says?
-My son won't lie

1148
00:54:28,275 --> 00:54:29,806
He has trained you like that

1149
00:54:30,003 --> 00:54:32,643
Punniyam! I would kill you myself
and turn over to the police

1150
00:54:32,886 --> 00:54:34,292
Yo navy guy!

1151
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:38,976
This is councilor Punniyakotti from
Thiruvallur district

1152
00:54:39,038 --> 00:54:42,063
Punniyakotti uncle! This is
my house and that is my swing

1153
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:45,623
So what? I don't have one at
home so am swinging in this

1154
00:54:45,624 --> 00:54:46,989
-Swing it fast
-Stop it!

1155
00:54:47,756 --> 00:54:48,654
Look here!

1156
00:54:49,084 --> 00:54:50,928
You have only two choices

1157
00:54:51,935 --> 00:54:52,435
One!

1158
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,606
Marry my younger daughter

1159
00:54:57,239 --> 00:54:58,476
No interested! Then?

1160
00:55:00,868 --> 00:55:01,508
Two!

1161
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:05,181
Marry some tramp from the street

1162
00:55:05,661 --> 00:55:07,193
Some tramp?

1163
00:55:07,396 --> 00:55:09,029
Look! You are my friend's uncle

1164
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,399
Not mine

1165
00:55:10,654 --> 00:55:13,178
Don't speak a word about my nephew

1166
00:55:13,223 --> 00:55:14,456
He is pure as gold

1167
00:55:14,534 --> 00:55:16,355
Gold? Why don't you pawn him then?

1168
00:55:16,394 --> 00:55:17,332
Mr. Navy guy!

1169
00:55:17,925 --> 00:55:20,285
Do you realize who
you are speaking to?

1170
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,592
Whatever it is, speak to my friend.
Now leave

1171
00:55:24,562 --> 00:55:26,046
Why are crying now?

1172
00:55:26,929 --> 00:55:29,914
It's been 10 days
since I spoke to him

1173
00:55:30,375 --> 00:55:32,336
He is not picking up my call too

1174
00:55:33,015 --> 00:55:35,538
I went to his house
and called him out

1175
00:55:35,601 --> 00:55:39,344
He screamed back 'I am not
at home' and sent me away

1176
00:55:39,538 --> 00:55:40,562
What else he did?

1177
00:55:40,773 --> 00:55:42,586
I tried to search
him in social media

1178
00:55:42,718 --> 00:55:44,697
But he has deactivated everything

1179
00:55:44,725 --> 00:55:47,323
He has also exited the 'Punniyam
family' whatsapp group

1180
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,059
You are the one responsible
for everything

1181
00:55:51,645 --> 00:55:54,848
In two months my daughter must
marry your friend

1182
00:55:55,247 --> 00:55:57,080
Else? Have this

1183
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,713
Did you get food
ration for this month?

1184
00:56:01,714 --> 00:56:02,588
Why are you asking?

1185
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:04,134
Do you have kerosine oil?

1186
00:56:04,274 --> 00:56:05,289
Just say it!

1187
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,758
Make the three of us sit on
this swing and set us ablaze

1188
00:56:09,362 --> 00:56:12,051
Stop creating a scene

1189
00:56:12,075 --> 00:56:14,285
I already face enough
drama from my dad

1190
00:56:14,388 --> 00:56:16,297
Your problem would be
solved in two months

1191
00:56:16,313 --> 00:56:17,649
Stop your cringy
performance and leave now

1192
00:56:21,232 --> 00:56:21,732
Look!

1193
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:24,840
I was waiting for
this promise from you

1194
00:56:26,354 --> 00:56:28,167
A good man will live
up to his promise

1195
00:56:29,112 --> 00:56:31,902
A noble man would always deliver
his promise at the promised time

1196
00:56:33,122 --> 00:56:35,747
I hope you would prove yourself to
be a noble man

1197
00:56:37,305 --> 00:56:38,289
Navy guy!

1198
00:56:38,571 --> 00:56:42,149
I came from Ammananbakkam in auto
rickshaw in a desperation to meet you

1199
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:44,376
He is waiting outside

1200
00:56:46,649 --> 00:56:48,111
Can you give me the auto fare?

1201
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,641
Such a miser you are

1202
00:56:49,875 --> 00:56:51,814
How come you are a
municipal councilor?

1203
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:55,660
Don't ask about that. I have heard
that question several times

1204
00:56:56,067 --> 00:56:57,145
My heart can't bear it anymore

1205
00:56:58,050 --> 00:56:59,480
Will meet you at the marriage

1206
00:57:01,409 --> 00:57:02,573
Why are you still here?

1207
00:57:03,597 --> 00:57:05,169
-I'll take my leave
-Get out soon

1208
00:57:05,245 --> 00:57:07,785
Do you need special announcement?
Leave

1209
00:57:07,786 --> 00:57:09,746
I would rather push you in the
well than marrying you

1210
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:16,604
Saami! All this cringe
is because of you

1211
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:18,183
I must solve this at once!

1212
00:57:18,487 --> 00:57:20,730
You people know why
I called you here?

1213
00:57:21,048 --> 00:57:24,393
Our college H.O.D
Shantha ma'am called me

1214
00:57:24,409 --> 00:57:26,777
Our department function
is happening in two days

1215
00:57:26,886 --> 00:57:29,332
We need to arrange
for a chief guest

1216
00:57:29,457 --> 00:57:30,879
Why is she asking us to do it?

1217
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,886
She could have asked the present
students right?

1218
00:57:32,895 --> 00:57:35,904
It's been a year since
we finished college

1219
00:57:36,176 --> 00:57:40,988
These new students would ask for a formal
permission even to go to the restroom

1220
00:57:41,052 --> 00:57:43,200
How can they bring in
a celebrity guest?

1221
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:45,309
Why can't we call actor Arya?

1222
00:57:45,537 --> 00:57:49,287
He replies to all my twitter
messages with a 'Darling...' prefix

1223
00:57:49,364 --> 00:57:51,247
He would reply to all your messages

1224
00:57:51,248 --> 00:57:52,224
But will he come?

1225
00:57:53,041 --> 00:57:54,736
What about actor Yogi Babu?

1226
00:57:54,853 --> 00:57:56,779
-It be fun and trendy
-It's a great idea

1227
00:57:56,860 --> 00:58:00,116
Sounds great but how would he manage
to come in his busy schedule?

1228
00:58:00,296 --> 00:58:01,328
Can I try bringing him?

1229
00:58:03,725 --> 00:58:05,015
I will do anything for you

1230
00:58:06,413 --> 00:58:07,912
Yeah come! We can
discuss in private

1231
00:58:08,788 --> 00:58:10,163
-I'll be back guys
-Who is he?

1232
00:58:10,607 --> 00:58:11,208
Don't know

1233
00:58:11,429 --> 00:58:12,459
Must be her boyfriend

1234
00:58:15,499 --> 00:58:16,941
What are you doing here?

1235
00:58:17,133 --> 00:58:20,113
I came to the nearby ration shop
to get free palm oil

1236
00:58:20,474 --> 00:58:22,417
I wouldn't laugh at your jokes
even if they are funny

1237
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:24,306
Don't irritate me and
leave this place

1238
00:58:24,371 --> 00:58:26,047
Instead of telling
you so many 'sorrys'

1239
00:58:26,093 --> 00:58:28,610
I would become rich if I had sold
few 'sarees'

1240
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:31,228
For me to accept your apologies...

1241
00:58:31,337 --> 00:58:32,872
I must first have trust in you

1242
00:58:32,957 --> 00:58:35,090
I don't trust you after
that BBC incident

1243
00:58:35,122 --> 00:58:35,622
Alright!

1244
00:58:35,811 --> 00:58:37,053
I'll come from your perspective

1245
00:58:37,254 --> 00:58:40,154
If I bring Yogi Babu to your
college culturals

1246
00:58:40,222 --> 00:58:41,286
Would I earn your trust?

1247
00:58:41,365 --> 00:58:42,318
Would you accept my apology?

1248
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:43,834
My father always tells

1249
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:45,706
Action is the greatest spoken word

1250
00:58:45,964 --> 00:58:47,964
Show me some action first.
We'll discuss everything later

1251
00:58:54,627 --> 00:58:55,986
-Dude!
-Tell me

1252
00:58:56,059 --> 00:58:57,980
I am in need of your service now

1253
00:58:59,027 --> 00:59:00,793
Yogi Babu did not pick my call

1254
00:59:00,847 --> 00:59:02,518
So we are going to
meet him directly

1255
00:59:09,558 --> 00:59:10,777
Let's hurry

1256
00:59:11,034 --> 00:59:13,241
I have known you since childhood

1257
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:15,297
But I never knew you are friends
with Yogi Babu

1258
00:59:15,367 --> 00:59:18,578
I met him in a cricket tournament

1259
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:20,233
There I was the captain and
he was the wicket keeper

1260
00:59:20,247 --> 00:59:21,976
He tortures the batsmen...

1261
00:59:22,087 --> 00:59:25,873
by shouting and clapping his hands
from behind the stumps and get the out

1262
00:59:26,265 --> 00:59:28,002
He has a big mouth and made it big

1263
00:59:28,269 --> 00:59:31,186
He has acted with all
the leading actors

1264
00:59:31,233 --> 00:59:33,081
By now he must have settled
down in a bungalow by ECR beach

1265
00:59:33,179 --> 00:59:35,311
-Why is he still residing in this area?
-Beach won't suit him

1266
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:37,264
Beach stinks of dry fish. He is Lord
Muruga devotee, so it won't suit him

1267
00:59:37,334 --> 00:59:39,264
One thing is sure. He is a
kind hearted person

1268
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:40,701
He has not forgot this place
where he grew up in

1269
00:59:40,803 --> 00:59:42,780
Even today, he would visit the
small tea shop every morning...

1270
00:59:42,795 --> 00:59:45,061
and have a ginger tea
before he goes to the shoot

1271
00:59:45,103 --> 00:59:45,954
He is a man of...

1272
00:59:46,034 --> 00:59:47,315
Is that Yogi Babu?

1273
00:59:47,378 --> 00:59:48,471
Yes! That is him

1274
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:49,673
Come I will
introduce you to him

1275
00:59:49,715 --> 00:59:51,941
-But why does he look weak?
-He just got fit!

1276
00:59:52,019 --> 00:59:53,447
Greetings wicket keeper Babu

1277
00:59:53,448 --> 00:59:54,706
-Sorry Yogi Babu
-Greetings

1278
00:59:54,816 --> 00:59:57,401
-He is my friend Aravind
-Why is your face hidden behind hair?

1279
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:59,214
Are you growing beard as
an offering to God?

1280
01:00:00,011 --> 01:00:02,365
-Look at his sense of humour
-Wow! What a sense of timing

1281
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:05,420
Such modesty! You are having
tea from this shop?

1282
01:00:05,576 --> 01:00:06,615
You are great!

1283
01:00:06,661 --> 01:00:08,151
Can I have a selfie with you?

1284
01:00:08,168 --> 01:00:09,315
Sure

1285
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:11,341
For the first time I'll
make you look good

1286
01:00:11,655 --> 01:00:12,725
Thank a lot!

1287
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,309
No one has taken a selfie with me

1288
01:00:15,513 --> 01:00:16,440
You are the first!

1289
01:00:16,816 --> 01:00:18,745
Send that selfie to my phone number

1290
01:00:18,769 --> 01:00:20,416
I will set it as my wallpaper

1291
01:00:20,448 --> 01:00:22,972
Babu! Control yourself

1292
01:00:23,246 --> 01:00:26,370
I don't get it? People take selfie
with even new vloggers

1293
01:00:26,518 --> 01:00:28,940
But no one has taken a selfie
with Yogi Babu?

1294
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:32,670
They would have, if
it was Yogi Babu

1295
01:00:32,992 --> 01:00:34,041
But this is Dilli Babu

1296
01:00:34,532 --> 01:00:36,753
-Dilli Babu?
-Yes, I am Dilli Babu

1297
01:00:37,102 --> 01:00:38,977
But he looks like Yogi Babu

1298
01:00:39,016 --> 01:00:41,120
He is the stunt double of Yogi Babu

1299
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,509
What an amazing find

1300
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:46,584
I would take him to
the college function

1301
01:00:46,873 --> 01:00:48,100
But one thing...

1302
01:00:48,647 --> 01:00:50,982
My girl Thulasi can
sniff out anything

1303
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:52,333
If she finds out,
it'll be embarrassing

1304
01:00:52,514 --> 01:00:54,991
If a Sailor like you
cannot find out...

1305
01:00:55,013 --> 01:00:56,529
How would a college
student find it?

1306
01:00:56,763 --> 01:00:58,513
Believe me and take
him to the college

1307
01:00:59,068 --> 01:01:00,802
-Babu! I can trust you, right?
-Sure

1308
01:01:01,123 --> 01:01:03,532
I'll call my girl now, can
you please talk to her?

1309
01:01:03,638 --> 01:01:05,599
Sure. Why not?

1310
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:09,795
-Hello
-Hello

1311
01:01:10,022 --> 01:01:10,522
Tell me

1312
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:12,584
I am with Yogi Babu right now

1313
01:01:12,874 --> 01:01:14,811
Invite him to you college function

1314
01:01:14,959 --> 01:01:16,185
Yeah sure

1315
01:01:16,686 --> 01:01:18,249
Talk to her

1316
01:01:18,419 --> 01:01:20,639
Hello! This is Yogi Babu speaking

1317
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:21,905
-Hi sir! Greetings!
-Greetings

1318
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,710
-I am a big fan of your comedy
-Thanks

1319
01:01:23,779 --> 01:01:27,053
Thanks a lot for accepting to come
for our college function

1320
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:28,517
No need to thank me

1321
01:01:28,906 --> 01:01:31,837
Payment, travel convenience and
two packs of cigarettes

1322
01:01:31,891 --> 01:01:33,454
I would happily go
anywhere for that

1323
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:36,383
-What? Packs of cigarette?
-Yes, the 18 rupees one

1324
01:01:36,921 --> 01:01:37,421
Hello!

1325
01:01:38,109 --> 01:01:38,953
What happened?

1326
01:01:40,453 --> 01:01:43,156
I think he is going to bring
some dupe as Yogi Babu

1327
01:01:43,226 --> 01:01:45,210
Uh-oh! So the function
will be cancelled then?

1328
01:01:45,553 --> 01:01:48,608
No! If we let that happen,
it'll spoil our reputation

1329
01:01:49,521 --> 01:01:51,163
Let them come, I'll deal them!

1330
01:01:56,539 --> 01:01:58,201
Where are they yet?

1331
01:02:00,435 --> 01:02:01,373
Come soon!

1332
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:05,513
Hi Thulasi!

1333
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:07,747
Why are you walking like your
wife is in labour ward?

1334
01:02:08,138 --> 01:02:10,458
Yogi Babu will be here on time

1335
01:02:10,661 --> 01:02:11,630
You would accept my apology

1336
01:02:11,755 --> 01:02:15,583
Then you'll become possessive and
stop me from speaking to other girls

1337
01:02:15,794 --> 01:02:17,450
I thinking how to handle it

1338
01:02:17,965 --> 01:02:19,182
So how do you know Yogi Babu?

1339
01:02:19,331 --> 01:02:20,588
Not only me, everybody
knows Yogi Babu

1340
01:02:20,666 --> 01:02:23,221
"I stand before her,
my eyes are charmed"

1341
01:02:23,377 --> 01:02:25,447
I am asking how do you know
him personally?

1342
01:02:25,495 --> 01:02:26,432
I met him for you

1343
01:02:26,807 --> 01:02:29,769
My friend and I toiled hard, then
contacted him and met in person

1344
01:02:29,806 --> 01:02:31,783
My friend is bringing him right now

1345
01:02:31,902 --> 01:02:32,402
You?

1346
01:02:32,792 --> 01:02:34,644
Toiled hard to get his contact?

1347
01:02:34,752 --> 01:02:35,252
Yes!

1348
01:02:35,597 --> 01:02:37,143
Let me see him

1349
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:40,323
Dude! Tell me

1350
01:02:40,348 --> 01:02:41,481
What is your star sign?

1351
01:02:41,956 --> 01:02:43,495
I don't know about that

1352
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:46,137
But my mom told that my time is
good and would get married soon

1353
01:02:46,479 --> 01:02:47,690
The bride is almost ready

1354
01:02:47,762 --> 01:02:48,785
I have a surprise for you

1355
01:02:48,941 --> 01:02:50,621
I am coming with the
original Yogi Babu

1356
01:02:50,761 --> 01:02:52,675
-Seriously?
-Yes!

1357
01:02:52,871 --> 01:02:54,397
He saw my missed calls and
called me back

1358
01:02:54,453 --> 01:02:57,389
I told him about your love
matter and he said he'll help us

1359
01:02:57,514 --> 01:02:59,584
He has agreed to come
to the college event

1360
01:02:59,685 --> 01:03:00,733
You are the man!

1361
01:03:00,897 --> 01:03:02,850
-You are swag!
-Okay! See you there

1362
01:03:03,895 --> 01:03:05,020
Yogi Babu is coming!

1363
01:03:05,085 --> 01:03:07,490
Yeah! We already know it right?
Why are you suddenly excited?

1364
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:09,710
I meant they are on the way

1365
01:03:09,764 --> 01:03:11,381
Is it? Let him come

1366
01:03:11,404 --> 01:03:12,498
Hey! Yogi Babu is here!

1367
01:03:14,022 --> 01:03:15,983
All the boys and girls look alike

1368
01:03:16,152 --> 01:03:17,528
Everybody is dressed the same

1369
01:03:17,529 --> 01:03:18,809
Its the trend of 2K kids

1370
01:03:19,888 --> 01:03:21,517
Hi Students!

1371
01:03:22,143 --> 01:03:24,916
Step aside everyone

1372
01:03:26,198 --> 01:03:28,619
You're so cool brother.
Dude! you have done it!

1373
01:03:28,644 --> 01:03:29,939
You look exactly like in
the movies

1374
01:03:29,978 --> 01:03:31,674
Don't touch me, I don't like boys

1375
01:03:31,721 --> 01:03:32,322
Give him

1376
01:03:33,956 --> 01:03:36,025
Your hand slipped?

1377
01:03:36,181 --> 01:03:39,117
No! I dropped it intentionally.
Pick it up for yourself

1378
01:03:39,187 --> 01:03:41,040
-Are you trying to humiliate him?
-Come let's go

1379
01:03:41,125 --> 01:03:42,367
What is happening?

1380
01:03:42,468 --> 01:03:44,414
Brother! There is fight between
these love birds

1381
01:03:44,461 --> 01:03:46,961
She is venting out that anger on
you! She will be alright soon

1382
01:03:47,054 --> 01:03:49,984
Girls have the same attitude
in both movies and real life

1383
01:03:50,257 --> 01:03:53,266
You ignore her! She has gone crazy

1384
01:03:53,428 --> 01:03:55,026
Why take crazy people into college?

1385
01:03:55,065 --> 01:03:56,471
I have the same doubt

1386
01:03:56,682 --> 01:03:58,010
Open the damn door!

1387
01:03:58,035 --> 01:03:58,708
Come in

1388
01:03:59,572 --> 01:04:01,174
Greetings

1389
01:04:01,502 --> 01:04:04,050
Your applause is our wealth.
Make it loud

1390
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,439
What is the problem with you?

1391
01:04:09,494 --> 01:04:11,485
Play your games with some one else

1392
01:04:11,761 --> 01:04:15,352
You can fool people in some stupid
festival in your neighbourhood

1393
01:04:15,465 --> 01:04:16,292
But not me

1394
01:04:16,345 --> 01:04:17,509
Stupid festival?

1395
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:18,631
-What is she telling
-Stay calm brother!

1396
01:04:18,655 --> 01:04:19,946
Are you out of your mind?

1397
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:21,750
This is world famous Yogi Babu

1398
01:04:22,102 --> 01:04:24,977
Every star in the industry
is waiting to work with him

1399
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:25,906
The entire Tamil film
industry is dependent on...

1400
01:04:25,976 --> 01:04:27,319
-Enough please!
-Shall I talk about that heroine

1401
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:28,803
Shut up or I will
break your jaws

1402
01:04:29,516 --> 01:04:32,162
Why are you acting like a lunatic?

1403
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,810
You want him here or not?

1404
01:04:33,974 --> 01:04:38,203
I know everything about
you and your little plan

1405
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:42,149
Behave yourselves till everything is
over and run away from this place

1406
01:04:42,197 --> 01:04:44,918
Else I would complain
to Mr.Yogi Babu

1407
01:04:45,002 --> 01:04:46,791
And put you in jail for fraud.
Understood!

1408
01:04:46,918 --> 01:04:47,447
Be careful!

1409
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,236
-Look at his dumb face!
-Fraud?

1410
01:04:49,351 --> 01:04:52,992
Who is she? Is she going to
complain to me about me?

1411
01:04:53,117 --> 01:04:55,516
I told right, she has gone crazy

1412
01:04:55,649 --> 01:04:58,258
Let her go and marry this aunty.
It would work better

1413
01:04:58,297 --> 01:05:01,094
As said in an old movie, this nation and
it's people are on the path of destruction

1414
01:05:01,149 --> 01:05:03,499
You gave the same one to
actor Arya right? Screw it

1415
01:05:03,578 --> 01:05:04,663
Here give this to your crazy
rabbit girlfriend

1416
01:05:04,711 --> 01:05:05,891
I don't need these. Sit!

1417
01:05:06,078 --> 01:05:07,796
-You're reading from Wikipedia right?
-Yes sir!

1418
01:05:07,866 --> 01:05:09,805
Those facts are false.
Go flirt with your boyfriend

1419
01:05:12,944 --> 01:05:14,384
Greetings my dear!

1420
01:05:14,506 --> 01:05:16,303
This is Mahesh Babu

1421
01:05:17,225 --> 01:05:19,530
He's a fake right?
Who cares what he speaks

1422
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,233
I am not ashamed to say this

1423
01:05:21,553 --> 01:05:23,858
I don't have a college education

1424
01:05:23,904 --> 01:05:26,030
Yeah! Colleges are
not for buffaloes

1425
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:28,584
I can hear your mind voice

1426
01:05:28,763 --> 01:05:31,539
You might ask if I would become
a statesman with college education

1427
01:05:31,945 --> 01:05:35,890
I didn't make it to college then but that's
why I made here today as chief guest

1428
01:05:35,968 --> 01:05:38,010
It's our ill fate to have you
as a chief guest

1429
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:43,190
There is a secret behind
my success as an actor

1430
01:05:43,321 --> 01:05:47,539
That secret is that I ignore the
negativity thrown at me

1431
01:05:47,659 --> 01:05:50,166
The people who body shamed me...

1432
01:05:50,463 --> 01:05:53,057
are begging for alms today

1433
01:05:53,118 --> 01:05:55,009
Some are even asking
me to be my assistants

1434
01:05:55,041 --> 01:05:56,713
Two of them are in this hall

1435
01:05:57,329 --> 01:05:58,666
He's talking about you

1436
01:06:00,193 --> 01:06:01,575
He's not talking about us

1437
01:06:01,699 --> 01:06:05,167
Take this advice and
reach for the skies

1438
01:06:05,488 --> 01:06:07,395
When things go wrong, just say...

1439
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,880
'F.... it'

1440
01:06:09,317 --> 01:06:11,199
Come on guys!

1441
01:06:11,466 --> 01:06:13,699
No bad words, this is college.
See you!

1442
01:06:14,824 --> 01:06:17,551
This professor dozed
off to my speech

1443
01:06:17,894 --> 01:06:21,242
Students! Your become what
you think! All the best!

1444
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:22,000
See you!

1445
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:24,313
Go to the last bench
and continue sleeping

1446
01:06:24,343 --> 01:06:25,257
Look at this sleepy face

1447
01:06:25,312 --> 01:06:26,359
He's leaving. Let's go

1448
01:06:27,273 --> 01:06:29,514
Here after I will never
help such friends

1449
01:06:29,991 --> 01:06:31,155
They are embarrassing me

1450
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:32,296
He is here. Come on

1451
01:06:32,536 --> 01:06:34,207
Sir! A selfie with us

1452
01:06:34,253 --> 01:06:37,299
Don't tag me in Instagram,
my wife would scold me

1453
01:06:37,745 --> 01:06:38,941
Its Yogi Babu

1454
01:06:39,042 --> 01:06:41,753
-Brother!
-He is leaving

1455
01:06:42,274 --> 01:06:43,626
Brother

1456
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,907
Yogi Babu sir. Could
you spare us a minute

1457
01:06:47,085 --> 01:06:47,827
What for?

1458
01:06:48,202 --> 01:06:51,133
The Principal ma'am
wants to meet you

1459
01:06:51,344 --> 01:06:52,816
How old is your principal?

1460
01:06:52,948 --> 01:06:53,847
Maybe 30

1461
01:06:55,041 --> 01:06:56,519
30? Let's go

1462
01:06:56,737 --> 01:06:58,096
-She's lying
-Move guys!

1463
01:06:58,166 --> 01:07:01,487
"A heart is blossoming
on this iron"

1464
01:07:01,604 --> 01:07:04,924
-The Principal has called for me
-Brother it is a trap

1465
01:07:06,243 --> 01:07:08,135
Madam! Are you putting on makeup

1466
01:07:08,627 --> 01:07:11,370
Come soon! I have some important
people to meet

1467
01:07:11,448 --> 01:07:13,628
You have some gift for me?

1468
01:07:14,001 --> 01:07:15,203
What are you doing?

1469
01:07:15,675 --> 01:07:16,691
You will get it!

1470
01:07:16,917 --> 01:07:19,135
You will get enough from the police

1471
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:20,698
You have some problem with me?

1472
01:07:20,753 --> 01:07:22,111
I have had enough of you

1473
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:23,409
-What do you want?
-What is your name?

1474
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:24,088
Yogi Babu!

1475
01:07:24,113 --> 01:07:25,472
-How many movies were you in?
-150 movies

1476
01:07:25,495 --> 01:07:26,597
-With Superstar Rajnikanth?
-One

1477
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:27,548
-With Thalapathy Vijay
-Five

1478
01:07:27,571 --> 01:07:28,649
-With Thala Ajith
-Five

1479
01:07:28,704 --> 01:07:30,517
-Other languages
-One with Shah Rukh Khan

1480
01:07:30,564 --> 01:07:33,000
I would even act with Tom Cruise,
what is your problem now?

1481
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:37,191
Wow! What a preparation!

1482
01:07:37,230 --> 01:07:39,565
You are a former Tik Tok artist right?

1483
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:40,170
Tell me

1484
01:07:40,198 --> 01:07:41,886
Wonder where that
BMW car came from?

1485
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:43,440
What's your problem?

1486
01:07:43,534 --> 01:07:45,311
You want me to prove that
I am Yogi Babu right?

1487
01:07:45,397 --> 01:07:46,725
Here! Pull my hair!

1488
01:07:46,794 --> 01:07:47,686
Pull!

1489
01:07:47,918 --> 01:07:48,965
It's real right?

1490
01:07:49,059 --> 01:07:51,732
See my eyes? They are red right?
Because of night shoots

1491
01:07:52,225 --> 01:07:53,139
Wait a moment!

1492
01:07:53,725 --> 01:07:54,318
Here!

1493
01:07:55,015 --> 01:07:58,225
My aadhar card, credit card,
union card, ration card

1494
01:07:58,420 --> 01:07:59,193
Everything is here

1495
01:07:59,248 --> 01:08:00,716
If you are still not convinced...

1496
01:08:00,782 --> 01:08:03,243
I can bring the nurse who
delivered me, but she is dead

1497
01:08:03,766 --> 01:08:05,438
Sorry sir!

1498
01:08:05,579 --> 01:08:08,774
I spoke to someone on the phone
yesterday and got suspicious

1499
01:08:08,931 --> 01:08:11,759
Please forgive me!

1500
01:08:12,094 --> 01:08:14,126
I don't need your apology!
Tell it to him!

1501
01:08:14,321 --> 01:08:16,407
All troubles are
because of this fool

1502
01:08:16,438 --> 01:08:17,415
-Brother!
-Give me my phone

1503
01:08:17,445 --> 01:08:19,727
They are conducting a school annual
day event in this same campus

1504
01:08:19,836 --> 01:08:21,282
There you would receive a big gift

1505
01:08:21,391 --> 01:08:23,414
Do I look like a
circus clown to you?

1506
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:24,030
Sorry sir!

1507
01:08:24,054 --> 01:08:26,000
To hell with your sorry.
Such an embarrassment

1508
01:08:26,063 --> 01:08:27,055
Get lost!

1509
01:08:27,811 --> 01:08:28,882
Are you mad?

1510
01:08:28,906 --> 01:08:30,788
Do you know how much we
did to bring him here?

1511
01:08:30,851 --> 01:08:33,005
Your apology is worth nothing.
Get lost!

1512
01:08:33,544 --> 01:08:34,880
Aravind! Sorry!

1513
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,973
He was the only celebrity I knew,
she ruined that too

1514
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:38,732
Aravind!

1515
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:41,336
Sorry! I am extremely sorry!

1516
01:08:43,055 --> 01:08:43,922
it's alright!

1517
01:08:44,125 --> 01:08:47,578
I won't make people beg for
apology like you

1518
01:08:48,164 --> 01:08:49,773
I accept your apology

1519
01:08:50,054 --> 01:08:51,148
But you have to do something first

1520
01:08:51,656 --> 01:08:52,327
What is that?

1521
01:08:52,718 --> 01:08:54,382
Excuse! One second!
-Yes!

1522
01:08:54,811 --> 01:08:55,608
Where are you going?

1523
01:08:56,039 --> 01:08:57,429
To propose to my girl, Soundarya

1524
01:08:58,117 --> 01:08:58,851
Cringe!

1525
01:08:59,553 --> 01:09:01,764
She's already committed.
Try someone else

1526
01:09:01,944 --> 01:09:03,617
Okay, boss. By the
way, it's plastic rose

1527
01:09:07,174 --> 01:09:08,392
Do you know sketching?

1528
01:09:08,424 --> 01:09:09,166
Yeah!

1529
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:10,244
Have done it in Photoshop

1530
01:09:10,486 --> 01:09:11,471
Why are you asking?

1531
01:09:11,541 --> 01:09:14,992
I want to see how our
child would look like

1532
01:09:15,062 --> 01:09:16,078
Can you sketch it?

1533
01:09:17,038 --> 01:09:18,969
Just out of curiosity

1534
01:09:20,008 --> 01:09:21,359
I would send you many options

1535
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:42,435
"You are a boundless beauty"

1536
01:09:42,576 --> 01:09:46,100
"You trap me at the first sight"

1537
01:09:46,139 --> 01:09:49,534
"I have etched your face in my heart"

1538
01:09:49,978 --> 01:09:53,261
"You have flooded my thoughts"

1539
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:57,112
"Like the soil waiting for rain"

1540
01:09:57,268 --> 01:10:00,485
"You evaporate me with your moves"

1541
01:10:00,929 --> 01:10:04,203
"Wherever I go, you
come before my eyes"

1542
01:10:04,281 --> 01:10:07,958
"Here she comes,
twisting me like a top"

1543
01:10:08,044 --> 01:10:11,688
"She makes me fly with her look"

1544
01:10:11,773 --> 01:10:15,407
"I am wandering like wild wind"

1545
01:10:15,478 --> 01:10:19,043
"She takes my breath
away as she goes"

1546
01:10:56,068 --> 01:10:59,013
"The sharpness in your eyes"

1547
01:10:59,677 --> 01:11:02,817
"Pierce me like a spear"

1548
01:11:03,450 --> 01:11:06,796
"Like a soft rice"

1549
01:11:07,012 --> 01:11:10,437
"You chew me slowly"

1550
01:11:10,506 --> 01:11:14,437
"You are driving myself crazy"

1551
01:11:14,757 --> 01:11:18,156
"You make me talk to myself"

1552
01:11:18,567 --> 01:11:21,798
"You steal my dreams"

1553
01:11:22,087 --> 01:11:25,683
"You break me like a doll"

1554
01:11:25,931 --> 01:11:29,273
"Nothing compares to you"

1555
01:11:29,632 --> 01:11:32,734
"I would paint you in the sky"

1556
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:36,319
"No one can love you like me"

1557
01:11:36,382 --> 01:11:39,983
"Here she comes,
twisting me like a top"

1558
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:43,859
"She makes me fly with her look"

1559
01:11:43,934 --> 01:11:47,688
"I am wandering like wild wind"

1560
01:11:47,781 --> 01:11:51,296
"She takes my breath away
as she goes"

1561
01:11:51,765 --> 01:11:55,358
"You are a boundless beauty"

1562
01:11:55,468 --> 01:11:58,922
"You trap me at the first sight"

1563
01:11:59,183 --> 01:12:02,531
"I have etched your face in my heart"

1564
01:12:02,687 --> 01:12:05,937
"You have flooded my thoughts"

1565
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:10,092
"Like the soil waiting for rain"

1566
01:12:10,217 --> 01:12:13,592
"You evaporate me with your moves"

1567
01:12:13,834 --> 01:12:17,021
"Wherever I go, you
come before my eyes"

1568
01:12:17,092 --> 01:12:20,677
"Here she comes,
twisting me like a top"

1569
01:12:21,021 --> 01:12:24,333
"She makes me fly with her look"

1570
01:12:24,427 --> 01:12:28,167
"I am wandering like wild wind"

1571
01:12:28,247 --> 01:12:31,933
"She takes my breath
away as she goes"

1572
01:12:41,497 --> 01:12:44,833
Thulasi, shall we go on a
cruise ship for our honeymoon?

1573
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,052
I can get special discounts

1574
01:12:46,203 --> 01:12:48,180
That will happen only
if we get married

1575
01:12:50,063 --> 01:12:51,445
What's wrong?

1576
01:12:51,547 --> 01:12:54,243
You were happy when I proposed
right? What is wrong now?

1577
01:12:54,493 --> 01:12:57,306
My dad would be alone
after our marriage

1578
01:12:57,579 --> 01:12:58,915
It worries me

1579
01:12:59,657 --> 01:13:00,915
He can be alone

1580
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,947
We can visit him often.
Simple right?

1581
01:13:03,064 --> 01:13:04,556
You don't understand

1582
01:13:04,659 --> 01:13:06,845
My father raised me alone after
my mom passed away

1583
01:13:07,079 --> 01:13:09,001
He has no one except me

1584
01:13:09,236 --> 01:13:11,103
He is the only person left for me

1585
01:13:12,626 --> 01:13:15,774
He doesn't look after him.
I have to take care of him

1586
01:13:16,376 --> 01:13:17,368
That is all right?

1587
01:13:17,517 --> 01:13:18,970
Why are you worried?

1588
01:13:19,072 --> 01:13:20,415
He can be with us after marriage

1589
01:13:20,665 --> 01:13:23,103
We can be together. I don't have
an issue with that

1590
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:25,923
You don't have any
issues, but he has

1591
01:13:26,259 --> 01:13:30,649
He says he'll be a free bird and
won't bother me after my marriage

1592
01:13:31,626 --> 01:13:32,407
Look!

1593
01:13:32,594 --> 01:13:35,597
I takes time to convince elder
people, but somehow we have to do it

1594
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:36,563
What's so complex about it?

1595
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:38,008
You don't know my father

1596
01:13:38,269 --> 01:13:41,503
Every time I bring up this topic, a
heated argument erupts between us

1597
01:13:41,644 --> 01:13:43,739
I don't know how to handle him

1598
01:13:44,708 --> 01:13:46,004
Don't you worry

1599
01:13:46,184 --> 01:13:47,919
I will speak to him

1600
01:13:48,355 --> 01:13:52,409
I'll even fight with and convince him
to live with us after our marriage

1601
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:53,205
Fine?

1602
01:13:53,363 --> 01:13:54,809
-Promise
-Promise

1603
01:13:54,871 --> 01:13:56,230
Awesome!

1604
01:13:59,377 --> 01:13:59,877
Come in!

1605
01:14:01,523 --> 01:14:02,795
-Come on!
-Okay

1606
01:14:03,412 --> 01:14:03,912
Dad!

1607
01:14:04,185 --> 01:14:05,435
He has such a beautiful daughter?

1608
01:14:05,482 --> 01:14:05,982
Dad!

1609
01:14:06,419 --> 01:14:08,630
Hi! Was watching
an important news

1610
01:14:08,973 --> 01:14:10,371
I told right! This is Aravind

1611
01:14:10,622 --> 01:14:11,599
Hi Aravind

1612
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,014
-How do you do?
-Am good

1613
01:14:13,872 --> 01:14:15,095
My daughter has told me
about you

1614
01:14:15,501 --> 01:14:17,983
You are a second grade
engineer in ship right?

1615
01:14:18,008 --> 01:14:18,931
-Yes!
-How is your job?

1616
01:14:18,956 --> 01:14:20,057
Its going great

1617
01:14:20,446 --> 01:14:20,946
Please sitdown

1618
01:14:23,305 --> 01:14:24,274
I want to ask...

1619
01:14:24,492 --> 01:14:27,915
If you are okay with me and
Thulasi getting married

1620
01:14:28,032 --> 01:14:31,056
I don't have any objections.
My daughter like you a lot

1621
01:14:31,224 --> 01:14:32,499
Are your parents okay with it?

1622
01:14:32,548 --> 01:14:34,032
They are perfectly okay with it

1623
01:14:34,709 --> 01:14:36,506
But I have a request from my side

1624
01:14:37,287 --> 01:14:40,600
After our marriage, I feel it would be bad
for an aged person like you to live alone

1625
01:14:40,906 --> 01:14:41,913
You can stay with us

1626
01:14:42,078 --> 01:14:44,805
You can take it as a request or
a condition, as you wish

1627
01:14:44,984 --> 01:14:46,680
How dare she reveal
my age to him?

1628
01:14:46,703 --> 01:14:47,203
Dad!

1629
01:14:47,579 --> 01:14:48,704
Why are you staring at me?

1630
01:14:48,862 --> 01:14:51,329
I was just admiring your hairstyle

1631
01:14:51,446 --> 01:14:53,376
It was his call, I have
nothing to do with it

1632
01:14:53,415 --> 01:14:55,585
-It's not a big deal
-Believe me dad

1633
01:14:55,772 --> 01:14:57,749
-Sure I believe you
-Look! He believes you

1634
01:14:58,350 --> 01:15:00,835
Mr Aravind! I have already
told my daughter

1635
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:02,202
I shall repeat it to you

1636
01:15:02,733 --> 01:15:04,585
I don't want to be a
disturbance to anyone

1637
01:15:04,632 --> 01:15:05,960
I want to be alone

1638
01:15:06,305 --> 01:15:09,492
You can take it as a request or
a condition, as you wish

1639
01:15:09,688 --> 01:15:12,415
Dad! He won't see you
as a disturbance

1640
01:15:12,509 --> 01:15:13,868
Why are you stubborn?

1641
01:15:14,046 --> 01:15:15,740
His acceptance shows his character

1642
01:15:15,936 --> 01:15:17,867
-Yeah! Many have told me so
-I really appreciate you

1643
01:15:17,922 --> 01:15:19,032
-Thanks a lot Sir
-Hats off

1644
01:15:19,375 --> 01:15:22,610
But I cannot follow you
two wherever you go

1645
01:15:24,274 --> 01:15:25,259
Don't force me

1646
01:15:25,455 --> 01:15:27,822
Uncle! We will definitely force you

1647
01:15:27,924 --> 01:15:29,416
We have the rights to do so

1648
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:32,314
See Aravind!

1649
01:15:32,636 --> 01:15:35,533
I. Cannot. Be. With. You

1650
01:15:35,964 --> 01:15:36,464
Dot

1651
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:38,722
In that case, this marriage is
not going to happen

1652
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:39,450
Dot

1653
01:15:40,775 --> 01:15:41,946
I am sorry Aravind

1654
01:15:42,842 --> 01:15:44,613
Okay! Forget about your marriage

1655
01:15:44,639 --> 01:15:46,076
Better go back to your ship

1656
01:15:46,626 --> 01:15:48,376
Why don't you marry some one?

1657
01:15:48,976 --> 01:15:50,195
Why are you troubling us?

1658
01:15:51,633 --> 01:15:54,378
His angry stare reminds
me of Angry Birds' owl!

1659
01:15:55,648 --> 01:15:56,562
What was that?

1660
01:15:57,297 --> 01:15:58,695
-Nothing!
-No you said something

1661
01:15:59,077 --> 01:16:01,091
-I was telling..
-I didn't hear it

1662
01:16:01,145 --> 01:16:02,330
Why don't you leave it then?

1663
01:16:02,541 --> 01:16:04,567
I was asking you to marry again

1664
01:16:04,568 --> 01:16:06,107
Your wife will take
good care of you

1665
01:16:06,138 --> 01:16:07,855
I will take good care of Thulasi

1666
01:16:07,952 --> 01:16:09,084
That is why I said so

1667
01:16:14,816 --> 01:16:15,706
Mr Aravind

1668
01:16:16,231 --> 01:16:18,590
At 6 pm today, I will meet you

1669
01:16:18,676 --> 01:16:19,995
-Dad?
-Him alone!

1670
01:16:20,786 --> 01:16:22,169
You wait and watch!

1671
01:16:22,464 --> 01:16:23,528
I'm sorry!

1672
01:16:24,059 --> 01:16:25,004
Sir, please!

1673
01:16:25,265 --> 01:16:26,038
Sorry!

1674
01:16:26,062 --> 01:16:26,562
Sir?

1675
01:16:27,577 --> 01:16:30,070
What have you done?

1676
01:16:30,281 --> 01:16:31,648
I went with the flow

1677
01:16:32,006 --> 01:16:33,435
You asked him to marry?

1678
01:16:33,662 --> 01:16:35,403
He doesn't like that idea!

1679
01:16:36,411 --> 01:16:37,835
I think he is furious with me

1680
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:38,507
God!

1681
01:16:38,508 --> 01:16:40,483
Another cringe to handle

1682
01:16:43,210 --> 01:16:44,452
Here he comes

1683
01:16:48,062 --> 01:16:48,749
Good evening sir!

1684
01:16:50,889 --> 01:16:52,749
I remember asking you to
come alone. Who's he?

1685
01:16:52,812 --> 01:16:55,710
It's Saturday night. Police patrol
would be heavy

1686
01:16:55,897 --> 01:16:58,608
He'll accompany me safely to home.
Just a support

1687
01:16:59,608 --> 01:17:00,613
Oh! A support

1688
01:17:00,690 --> 01:17:03,199
Saaminathan, owner of Panchabhoodham
travels. Nice to meet you!

1689
01:17:04,042 --> 01:17:05,621
Seems like he doesn't
shake hands with anyone

1690
01:17:11,673 --> 01:17:12,523
Good evening, sir

1691
01:17:14,669 --> 01:17:16,098
Nice boy!

1692
01:17:17,249 --> 01:17:19,780
-I think he is regular here
-Let's order too

1693
01:17:29,649 --> 01:17:30,948
He just gulped it down

1694
01:17:38,801 --> 01:17:40,061
Did they poison him?

1695
01:17:45,314 --> 01:17:47,244
What happened? Did they
give you the wrong drink?

1696
01:17:49,393 --> 01:17:51,322
Did they add anything in it?

1697
01:17:51,814 --> 01:17:52,955
Why are you crying?

1698
01:17:53,119 --> 01:17:54,361
What happened?

1699
01:17:55,940 --> 01:18:00,573
All these days, my daughter has asked
me to stay with her after marriage

1700
01:18:00,662 --> 01:18:03,089
But she never thought
of getting me a partner

1701
01:18:03,967 --> 01:18:05,553
But you! A stranger

1702
01:18:05,692 --> 01:18:08,638
You wanted me to marry someone

1703
01:18:09,126 --> 01:18:11,014
Those word of your's

1704
01:18:11,076 --> 01:18:14,053
I went back to my younger self

1705
01:18:17,584 --> 01:18:20,814
Who the bloody hell said a widower,
who has a daughter, cannot marry ?

1706
01:18:20,990 --> 01:18:21,693
Who said so?

1707
01:18:21,777 --> 01:18:23,527
I don't know. Must be some trash
like him

1708
01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:24,486
I was not me

1709
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:25,939
-It's not him it seems
-Look here!

1710
01:18:26,245 --> 01:18:27,854
Age is not a bar for marriage

1711
01:18:28,486 --> 01:18:32,698
All you need is a young heart and
a strong body

1712
01:18:32,818 --> 01:18:35,028
For me, age is just a number

1713
01:18:35,372 --> 01:18:36,387
-What?
-Number

1714
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:38,840
-Want me to prove?
-It's alright

1715
01:18:39,106 --> 01:18:40,199
-How about you?
-Am fine

1716
01:18:40,253 --> 01:18:42,190
-Would you both like to see?
-Leave us alone

1717
01:18:45,863 --> 01:18:47,542
Why are you looking funny?

1718
01:18:47,581 --> 01:18:51,456
Nothing. Just feels like the drink is
making some rounds in my stomach

1719
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,390
Can you make yourself clear before
our next round of drinks

1720
01:18:54,585 --> 01:18:55,812
My daughter, Thulasi...

1721
01:18:56,937 --> 01:18:57,984
No one is watching right?

1722
01:18:58,162 --> 01:18:59,818
My daughter, Thulasi...

1723
01:19:00,061 --> 01:19:02,271
She always tells me
that I am an aged man

1724
01:19:02,546 --> 01:19:04,179
"You will slip in the bathroom"

1725
01:19:04,664 --> 01:19:06,164
"You will get chest pain
while you're asleep"

1726
01:19:06,265 --> 01:19:08,664
"Your sugar level may
drop while driving"

1727
01:19:08,866 --> 01:19:10,350
She keeps on telling these to me

1728
01:19:10,664 --> 01:19:14,765
Have you seen patients struggling
for their life in ICU ward?

1729
01:19:14,804 --> 01:19:16,778
She treats me like them

1730
01:19:16,832 --> 01:19:19,637
Sir you are wrong! She loves you
more than anything

1731
01:19:19,793 --> 01:19:22,229
Damn! To hell with her love for me!

1732
01:19:22,543 --> 01:19:26,306
I wasted half my life showing
love and making pan cakes for her

1733
01:19:26,431 --> 01:19:28,517
I am also a human right?

1734
01:19:28,650 --> 01:19:30,243
I have feelings too

1735
01:19:30,290 --> 01:19:31,962
What is your feeling?

1736
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:33,778
Now you have come to
the point, darling!

1737
01:19:34,027 --> 01:19:35,071
Give me your hand

1738
01:19:35,544 --> 01:19:37,114
Eyes like a blazing fire

1739
01:19:37,403 --> 01:19:39,067
Voice like a sweet honey

1740
01:19:39,325 --> 01:19:41,457
Touch that would send shivers

1741
01:19:41,512 --> 01:19:44,082
I want to marry a woman like that

1742
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:49,168
And enjoy every second of my
exotic life with her

1743
01:19:49,637 --> 01:19:51,347
How can I tell this to my daughter?

1744
01:19:51,707 --> 01:19:52,965
Won't she spit at me?

1745
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:55,513
Definitely she would!
Even I feel like spitting at you

1746
01:19:55,622 --> 01:19:57,824
Mr. Support! Stop it!

1747
01:19:57,849 --> 01:19:59,013
What are you asking me to do?

1748
01:19:59,014 --> 01:20:00,989
Everything!

1749
01:20:01,701 --> 01:20:05,920
Find a girl of my liking and
marry her to me

1750
01:20:05,973 --> 01:20:07,856
Your marriage would
happen right after

1751
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:09,647
To put it simple

1752
01:20:09,811 --> 01:20:10,725
I got it!

1753
01:20:10,967 --> 01:20:13,342
Only If I marry you with a girl
of your liking...

1754
01:20:13,545 --> 01:20:14,709
My marriage will happen

1755
01:20:15,225 --> 01:20:17,287
I will make it happen.
I swear it on my love

1756
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:20,369
I don't care if you swear
by your love or stove!

1757
01:20:23,946 --> 01:20:26,556
So, since you'll get
sloshed tonight...

1758
01:20:26,627 --> 01:20:30,329
you brought a 'Mr. Support' to
take you home safe, right?

1759
01:20:30,439 --> 01:20:31,797
Swear on his life!

1760
01:20:32,039 --> 01:20:36,079
Dude! A bus of mine has to go to Kasi,
I should perform some rituals on it

1761
01:20:36,135 --> 01:20:38,155
Why don't you two sort things out.
Bye gentlemen!

1762
01:20:38,186 --> 01:20:40,194
The driver would take care of it.
You sit down

1763
01:20:40,219 --> 01:20:42,139
-I Promise
-No don't

1764
01:20:42,179 --> 01:20:43,050
It's a promise

1765
01:20:43,074 --> 01:20:44,925
Super!

1766
01:20:46,167 --> 01:20:48,391
Mr. Support and
Mr. Navy, come closer

1767
01:20:49,034 --> 01:20:54,471
If you try to expose me to my
daughter and tarnish my image...

1768
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:57,473
We know what follows. You would tie
us to the lamp post and bash us

1769
01:20:57,769 --> 01:20:59,537
Good! You have understood me

1770
01:20:59,573 --> 01:21:01,035
Good that you both have that fear

1771
01:21:01,098 --> 01:21:02,961
Can you two stand up for a moment

1772
01:21:03,138 --> 01:21:04,341
We are already up

1773
01:21:04,706 --> 01:21:06,424
Don't stand up drunk! Sit down!

1774
01:21:06,536 --> 01:21:07,988
He had only one round!

1775
01:21:08,355 --> 01:21:11,191
I didn't live my first
marriage to the fullest

1776
01:21:11,869 --> 01:21:13,777
God has given me a chance now

1777
01:21:13,855 --> 01:21:15,990
-Drats!
-I would enjoy it to the fullest

1778
01:21:16,514 --> 01:21:19,577
Else I'll finish off
both your lives

1779
01:21:19,763 --> 01:21:20,786
See you!

1780
01:21:20,787 --> 01:21:21,787
-Sir!

1781
01:21:22,022 --> 01:21:24,309
If you can you give some references
to find a girl for you

1782
01:21:24,411 --> 01:21:26,486
We would start the ground work today

1783
01:21:26,598 --> 01:21:27,926
How did I I forget it?

1784
01:21:28,245 --> 01:21:30,433
Send a 'Hi' to my
Whatsapp number...

1785
01:21:30,761 --> 01:21:32,410
And I will send you all I need

1786
01:21:33,743 --> 01:21:36,308
So many photos of women
even before sending a 'Hi'

1787
01:21:36,899 --> 01:21:37,715
What is this?

1788
01:21:38,234 --> 01:21:41,197
That lunatic has downloaded
everything from Google

1789
01:21:41,228 --> 01:21:43,867
Tragedy has struck my life

1790
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:49,500
It's my uncle Punniyakotti!
What shall I do now?

1791
01:21:49,672 --> 01:21:50,813
Cut the call

1792
01:21:50,891 --> 01:21:54,445
I would cut the call, you better cut that
Thulasi and find some other girl

1793
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:56,164
Everyone would be happy

1794
01:21:56,234 --> 01:21:59,062
Don't worry! I will get my Thulasi and you
would get your Malar

1795
01:21:59,087 --> 01:22:00,843
-But how?
-We need only one thing

1796
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:01,443
-What is that?

1797
01:22:01,503 --> 01:22:03,356
Ready one, two, three, start

1798
01:22:03,407 --> 01:22:06,386
"God's mercy! Mercy! Mercy!"

1799
01:22:06,496 --> 01:22:09,527
"God's mercy! Mercy! Mercy!"

1800
01:22:09,714 --> 01:22:12,550
"God's mercy! Mercy! Mercy!"

1801
01:22:12,855 --> 01:22:15,874
"God's mercy! Mercy! Mercy!"

1802
01:22:23,082 --> 01:22:23,582
Hello!

1803
01:22:24,089 --> 01:22:26,103
Uncle said you went for an
interview. Got the job?

1804
01:22:26,281 --> 01:22:27,733
Yeah! I got it -Is it?

1805
01:22:27,757 --> 01:22:29,313
The appointment
letter is in my hands.

1806
01:22:29,408 --> 01:22:31,135
Wow! Congrats! Awesome.

1807
01:22:31,264 --> 01:22:32,979
- Why do you care?
- Why?

1808
01:22:33,117 --> 01:22:36,515
You never called me after
meeting my dad. Not even a text.

1809
01:22:36,572 --> 01:22:39,015
Oh! Something
happened last night

1810
01:22:39,117 --> 01:22:40,595
I thought of explaining
you in person.

1811
01:22:40,619 --> 01:22:42,190
You will have an
excuse for everything.

1812
01:22:42,449 --> 01:22:43,449
Nothing like that. Hello!

1813
01:22:56,515 --> 01:22:58,593
What are you doing with the tyre?

1814
01:22:58,632 --> 01:23:01,284
I was repairing the
tyre of my travels bus.

1815
01:23:01,536 --> 01:23:04,410
He called me for some emergency,
so I came here as I was.

1816
01:23:04,535 --> 01:23:05,535
To be very frank.

1817
01:23:05,621 --> 01:23:08,268
These days I am doing his marriage
works more than my travels works.

1818
01:23:08,292 --> 01:23:10,726
Dude! We are not working
for my marriage.

1819
01:23:10,798 --> 01:23:12,130
We are working for our marriages.

1820
01:23:12,328 --> 01:23:13,890
Our marriage! Our right!

1821
01:23:14,552 --> 01:23:15,944
What happened yesterday night?

1822
01:23:16,226 --> 01:23:17,788
My dad is also not
telling me anything.

1823
01:23:17,859 --> 01:23:19,156
Are you planning for a break up?

1824
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:21,906
Break up? Me?

1825
01:23:22,289 --> 01:23:23,999
Can you fix your
tyre somewhere else

1826
01:23:24,312 --> 01:23:25,375
I was...

1827
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:26,661
What?

1828
01:23:26,717 --> 01:23:27,650
Let me take my vehicle.

1829
01:23:27,685 --> 01:23:30,440
- Whatever! Just leave!
- You keep drooling here.

1830
01:23:30,904 --> 01:23:33,201
I must blame myself
for coming with you.

1831
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:33,780
Hello!

1832
01:23:33,998 --> 01:23:37,196
It's you girls who would think
of breaking up for silly reasons.

1833
01:23:37,399 --> 01:23:40,790
But we boys would look for
solution to fix the problem.

1834
01:23:40,952 --> 01:23:43,532
Is it from a Whatsapp
forward or a meme?

1835
01:23:44,022 --> 01:23:45,813
Not from anywhere. This is reality.

1836
01:23:46,078 --> 01:23:49,435
Actually your dad has agreed to
second marriage.

1837
01:23:49,764 --> 01:23:51,560
Here on, his wife will
take care of him

1838
01:23:51,641 --> 01:23:53,341
I will take care of my sweetheart.

1839
01:23:53,412 --> 01:23:54,412
Wait a moment!

1840
01:23:54,616 --> 01:23:56,706
- My dad agreed to marry?
- Yeah!

1841
01:23:56,831 --> 01:23:58,050
- To you?
- Of course

1842
01:23:58,199 --> 01:23:59,199
I wont believe it

1843
01:23:59,276 --> 01:24:01,514
I knew you wouldn't trust me.

1844
01:24:01,632 --> 01:24:02,942
That is why I have
my voice recorder.

1845
01:24:02,966 --> 01:24:04,116
Dude! Play it -Yes, dude.

1846
01:24:04,889 --> 01:24:05,686
Oh you are here.

1847
01:24:05,748 --> 01:24:08,170
Tell her what her
dad said yesterday.

1848
01:24:08,265 --> 01:24:09,775
Three large drinks
and two small drinks.

1849
01:24:09,799 --> 01:24:11,721
And took two chill beers home.

1850
01:24:11,767 --> 01:24:12,963
Everything in our expense.

1851
01:24:12,994 --> 01:24:14,713
Not that -I swear

1852
01:24:14,814 --> 01:24:17,774
- I was asking about the marriage stuff.
- Oh that one?

1853
01:24:18,642 --> 01:24:22,883
We told your dad that he is aging
and that he needs a company.

1854
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:26,993
As soon as he heard that he took
a bottle and came to hit us.

1855
01:24:27,841 --> 01:24:29,244
Not me! It's your dad's action.

1856
01:24:29,384 --> 01:24:30,384
My dad?

1857
01:24:30,673 --> 01:24:33,962
Then for next three hours we
discussed with him.

1858
01:24:34,025 --> 01:24:35,340
Yeah! Time went by.

1859
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:37,637
We tried to convince him.

1860
01:24:37,871 --> 01:24:40,105
But your father got a bit emotional.

1861
01:24:40,769 --> 01:24:43,331
And told that he would do this
sacrifice for his daughter.

1862
01:24:43,543 --> 01:24:46,153
But he asked us not to
reveal this to his daughter.

1863
01:24:46,294 --> 01:24:49,583
- And he started weeping like a child.
- Don't overdo.

1864
01:24:50,215 --> 01:24:50,809
Anyway...

1865
01:24:51,082 --> 01:24:52,629
You also don't discuss
this with him.

1866
01:24:52,691 --> 01:24:55,028
Are you happy now?

1867
01:24:55,644 --> 01:24:58,863
You have done the impossible! Wow!

1868
01:24:59,705 --> 01:25:01,159
Awesome! I agree now.

1869
01:25:01,349 --> 01:25:02,804
- Boys are the best!
- Of course!

1870
01:25:02,876 --> 01:25:04,304
I don't know how to thank you.

1871
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:07,581
This baboon is still here?

1872
01:25:07,605 --> 01:25:08,762
- Dude?
- Sorry dude!

1873
01:25:08,831 --> 01:25:10,377
- What is this.
- It's a public place...

1874
01:25:10,401 --> 01:25:12,612
Be safe. Police might arrest you.

1875
01:25:14,206 --> 01:25:15,206
Thank you!

1876
01:25:15,433 --> 01:25:16,956
I start job from Monday.

1877
01:25:16,988 --> 01:25:19,206
So tomorrow first thing in
the morning

1878
01:25:19,449 --> 01:25:24,659
I would go to some matrimony office and
look for single woman, divorcee...

1879
01:25:25,556 --> 01:25:27,056
Hold on a moment!

1880
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:30,205
He has asked us not to
involve you in this matter.

1881
01:25:30,230 --> 01:25:31,829
Saami and I would take care of this.

1882
01:25:31,875 --> 01:25:32,875
Saami!

1883
01:25:34,683 --> 01:25:35,683
Saami?

1884
01:25:36,028 --> 01:25:38,434
Where are you at? He'll be
around when I don't need him!

1885
01:25:40,246 --> 01:25:41,246
It's him.

1886
01:25:41,488 --> 01:25:42,347
Where did you go?

1887
01:25:42,482 --> 01:25:45,167
I was not able to bear your
silly love drama.

1888
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:47,918
So I rolled the wheel a long way,
will fix it and call you later.

1889
01:25:47,958 --> 01:25:48,958
Dude!

1890
01:25:49,192 --> 01:25:50,192
Wait!

1891
01:25:50,372 --> 01:25:53,278
He went to the restroom it seems.

1892
01:25:53,935 --> 01:25:55,911
From now on, there are
no more confusions.

1893
01:25:56,183 --> 01:25:57,972
Only celebrations!

1894
01:25:59,004 --> 01:26:00,004
But first

1895
01:26:00,308 --> 01:26:01,433
go shave your beard.

1896
01:26:02,225 --> 01:26:05,356
I thought girls like bearded guys.
She's from another planet I guess.

1897
01:26:08,026 --> 01:26:09,120
Enter with your right foot.

1898
01:26:10,104 --> 01:26:11,510
South Indian matrimony!

1899
01:26:11,682 --> 01:26:12,557
Why are we here?

1900
01:26:12,582 --> 01:26:14,442
To have our breakfast

1901
01:26:14,501 --> 01:26:16,830
I could have made it for you myself.

1902
01:26:16,993 --> 01:26:18,541
Why did you drag me
to the ninth floor?

1903
01:26:18,594 --> 01:26:19,798
Oh! He's trying to be funny.

1904
01:26:19,823 --> 01:26:20,823
Be quiet!

1905
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:22,378
Dude! I have been quiet
since we became friends!

1906
01:26:22,402 --> 01:26:24,074
Oh! He is a jobless dude is it?

1907
01:26:24,126 --> 01:26:25,495
Sorry! I forgot to tell you.

1908
01:26:25,534 --> 01:26:26,400
Forget that

1909
01:26:26,486 --> 01:26:29,752
I have collected all your necessary
information from Thulasi.

1910
01:26:30,111 --> 01:26:33,181
You just have to select the girl and
the next stop is your honeymoon.

1911
01:26:33,212 --> 01:26:34,524
Not ready for honeymoon?

1912
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:37,438
You have the zeal but do
you have the ability?

1913
01:26:37,492 --> 01:26:39,540
Before that, let's check if
you find a suitable match!

1914
01:26:39,564 --> 01:26:40,979
What is your problem now?

1915
01:26:41,181 --> 01:26:43,752
I have a lot of problems
but the first one is you.

1916
01:26:46,056 --> 01:26:48,524
Why is this trash
sticking with you?

1917
01:26:48,844 --> 01:26:49,931
Excuse me!

1918
01:26:50,041 --> 01:26:52,663
You put it in a nice way.

1919
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:55,812
Know your place. Okay?

1920
01:26:55,983 --> 01:26:58,515
Mr. Navy boy, be careful of him.
He overhears everything.

1921
01:26:58,547 --> 01:26:59,882
He is a dummy, sir. Don't worry.

1922
01:27:00,837 --> 01:27:03,867
Why does this aged kangaroo
wants to get married?

1923
01:27:04,079 --> 01:27:05,821
Wow! It's a bright start.

1924
01:27:05,954 --> 01:27:06,445
Hi!

1925
01:27:06,469 --> 01:27:08,180
Welcome to South India matrimony!

1926
01:27:08,251 --> 01:27:09,571
Who is the profile for?

1927
01:27:09,830 --> 01:27:11,655
Your elder son or younger son?

1928
01:27:13,138 --> 01:27:14,145
Sir! Wait!

1929
01:27:14,411 --> 01:27:16,129
Is this the way to talk?

1930
01:27:16,394 --> 01:27:18,372
We need a girl for this youngster.

1931
01:27:18,403 --> 01:27:19,191
Sorry!

1932
01:27:19,216 --> 01:27:22,184
This guy with cheap
sunglasses right here

1933
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:23,364
is our groom.

1934
01:27:23,661 --> 01:27:25,558
Can I have your user name.

1935
01:27:25,606 --> 01:27:28,115
User name is Ramachandran_K.

1936
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:29,897
Password is 'Aravind weds Thulasi'

1937
01:27:30,224 --> 01:27:32,014
Nicely done!

1938
01:27:32,084 --> 01:27:33,333
So that you won't forget it.

1939
01:27:33,357 --> 01:27:34,709
Looks like you won't forget.

1940
01:27:34,787 --> 01:27:36,521
- That's how strong it is.
- Yes, sir.

1941
01:27:36,650 --> 01:27:39,023
We have found the matches
for your profile.

1942
01:27:39,266 --> 01:27:42,016
You have to pay for the 6 month
premium membership initially.

1943
01:27:42,367 --> 01:27:44,651
And we will provide
you full assistance.

1944
01:27:45,151 --> 01:27:46,151
One second.

1945
01:27:47,471 --> 01:27:49,675
Are you paying by
cash, card or gpay?

1946
01:27:49,745 --> 01:27:50,925
Anything is fine.

1947
01:27:51,236 --> 01:27:52,558
It's your marriage
expenditure right?

1948
01:27:52,582 --> 01:27:53,877
Dude! Your trapped.

1949
01:27:53,917 --> 01:27:55,195
Are you paying by
cash, card or gpay?

1950
01:27:55,219 --> 01:27:57,713
Anything is fine. It's your
marriage expenditure right?

1951
01:27:57,743 --> 01:27:58,743
Take out your wallet.

1952
01:27:58,776 --> 01:27:59,776
My expenditure?

1953
01:28:01,272 --> 01:28:02,461
He was talking to you only.

1954
01:28:03,164 --> 01:28:04,524
- What is this?
- Yeah he is right!

1955
01:28:05,656 --> 01:28:07,594
I am the one trapped here.

1956
01:28:07,995 --> 01:28:09,352
Why is the screen so small?

1957
01:28:09,378 --> 01:28:10,706
I am screwed!

1958
01:28:11,942 --> 01:28:13,714
Can you come with me.

1959
01:28:13,738 --> 01:28:14,994
- Yes! Of course.
- Control yourself.

1960
01:28:15,018 --> 01:28:17,168
To check out matching profiles.

1961
01:28:17,285 --> 01:28:18,620
In such a smaller screen?

1962
01:28:18,652 --> 01:28:19,652
Thing is...

1963
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:23,512
In the excitement of wearing cooling
glass I forgot my reading glass.

1964
01:28:24,184 --> 01:28:26,099
Would be better if we see
on a bigger screen.

1965
01:28:26,692 --> 01:28:27,919
I got this, sir.

1966
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:29,872
Actually, he comes
from a royal family.

1967
01:28:30,085 --> 01:28:32,205
So he wants to check out the
profiles in a big screen.

1968
01:28:32,412 --> 01:28:34,092
Can you arrange that quickly?

1969
01:28:34,130 --> 01:28:36,990
Sorry! To use the projector...

1970
01:28:37,146 --> 01:28:39,395
We need get the permission
from our head office in Mumbai.

1971
01:28:39,419 --> 01:28:39,919
What?

1972
01:28:40,021 --> 01:28:43,505
Can't you do this help for a old man
who forgot his glasses at home?

1973
01:28:43,607 --> 01:28:45,817
And you want to wait for a
approval from Mumbai?

1974
01:28:45,896 --> 01:28:48,559
For just 120 rupees we can see
a 3D film in big screen

1975
01:28:48,621 --> 01:28:50,168
I have paid 32,000 rupees for this.

1976
01:28:50,734 --> 01:28:52,714
I told you right! He overheard us.

1977
01:28:52,965 --> 01:28:54,997
Yeah I overheard you!
That is my habit.

1978
01:28:55,239 --> 01:28:57,254
That's a bad habit -Yes I agree.

1979
01:28:57,310 --> 01:29:00,095
You speak as if I
overheard your secrets?

1980
01:29:00,129 --> 01:29:01,716
Please calm down! Relax!

1981
01:29:01,810 --> 01:29:04,255
I will get the
permission right away.

1982
01:29:04,295 --> 01:29:05,855
- Make it fast.
- Don't be so desperate.

1983
01:29:08,192 --> 01:29:10,810
Hope I will find my girl.

1984
01:29:14,217 --> 01:29:15,217
What?

1985
01:29:15,522 --> 01:29:16,905
I have no matches?

1986
01:29:17,334 --> 01:29:20,459
He doesn't have a match in the
entire country?

1987
01:29:20,506 --> 01:29:21,951
What sort of matrimony is this?

1988
01:29:22,172 --> 01:29:22,672
Dude!

1989
01:29:22,789 --> 01:29:25,046
-What about my 32,000
-Is that important now?

1990
01:29:25,274 --> 01:29:26,766
Return my money back.

1991
01:29:26,821 --> 01:29:28,687
Here we don't refund money.

1992
01:29:28,711 --> 01:29:30,523
Give me your earrings then.
I would sell it.

1993
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:31,354
- Sir!
- What?

1994
01:29:31,518 --> 01:29:34,377
It's not our fault. He has given girls
below 25 years old as a criteria.

1995
01:29:34,618 --> 01:29:35,961
Ask him!

1996
01:29:36,032 --> 01:29:37,180
Uh-oh! She ratted me out.

1997
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:39,307
Is he looking to adopt a girl?

1998
01:29:39,992 --> 01:29:41,888
Table damage would cost you
8000 rupees.

1999
01:29:41,932 --> 01:29:43,127
We accept only cash for that.

2000
01:29:44,010 --> 01:29:45,705
Leave those brats!

2001
01:29:45,729 --> 01:29:49,539
Can we push that 25 to 45?

2002
01:29:49,922 --> 01:29:51,094
Can we do it?

2003
01:29:51,149 --> 01:29:53,555
Even 85 wouldn't match you.

2004
01:29:54,608 --> 01:29:55,890
She is Shivaranjani.

2005
01:29:55,946 --> 01:29:56,870
She looks like you.

2006
01:29:56,949 --> 01:29:58,155
No! She looks like you

2007
01:29:58,225 --> 01:29:59,702
- I am okay with her.
- Is he okay with her?

2008
01:29:59,726 --> 01:30:00,374
Next!

2009
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:01,520
She is Keerthana.

2010
01:30:01,769 --> 01:30:03,339
She is loud mouth Keerthana!
I know her.

2011
01:30:03,363 --> 01:30:04,363
Stop lying!

2012
01:30:04,471 --> 01:30:05,471
Next!

2013
01:30:05,705 --> 01:30:06,799
Her -Next.

2014
01:30:07,683 --> 01:30:10,987
Next! Next! Next!

2015
01:30:11,333 --> 01:30:13,555
What the hell is this?

2016
01:30:14,448 --> 01:30:15,448
You!

2017
01:30:16,333 --> 01:30:17,870
Can you give us two minutes.

2018
01:30:18,364 --> 01:30:19,701
Please make it fast

2019
01:30:19,828 --> 01:30:22,508
I'll have to mail back to the Mumbai
head office if there's a delay

2020
01:30:22,547 --> 01:30:24,701
I will finish this
as quick as possible.

2021
01:30:25,036 --> 01:30:27,520
- Did she work in a browsing centre before?
- No idea.

2022
01:30:27,553 --> 01:30:28,797
What are hell are you thinking?

2023
01:30:29,294 --> 01:30:31,661
I sent you the references right?
Is this what you found?

2024
01:30:32,154 --> 01:30:32,654
Sir!

2025
01:30:32,974 --> 01:30:34,537
The references you sent

2026
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:37,062
are supermodels who don't
even give dates to movie stars.

2027
01:30:37,095 --> 01:30:38,767
How would they accept you?

2028
01:30:38,817 --> 01:30:40,040
Please be reasonable.

2029
01:30:40,935 --> 01:30:43,988
Your dramatics won't work on me.

2030
01:30:44,013 --> 01:30:44,558
He found out

2031
01:30:44,621 --> 01:30:47,551
I won't leave you guys
until I find my girl.

2032
01:30:47,682 --> 01:30:49,106
This is your first warning.

2033
01:30:49,529 --> 01:30:52,528
If this happens again, I
will cancel your marriage.

2034
01:30:54,169 --> 01:30:56,357
I was talking about
your marriage, not mine.

2035
01:30:56,655 --> 01:30:57,858
- Sir?
- Yes!

2036
01:30:58,020 --> 01:31:00,068
It affects your marriage too.

2037
01:31:00,219 --> 01:31:01,591
Not enough!

2038
01:31:01,872 --> 01:31:03,560
Your energy level is not enough!

2039
01:31:03,724 --> 01:31:05,286
You must have fire like energy!

2040
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:07,861
God, he's a lunatic and
wants to get married!

2041
01:31:07,885 --> 01:31:10,205
Asked you to find me a bride
and you're showing me aunties.

2042
01:31:10,288 --> 01:31:11,648
Don't step into my
home ever again.

2043
01:31:11,715 --> 01:31:13,325
Find me a girl and
then marry my girl.

2044
01:31:15,856 --> 01:31:18,379
Are you going to burn yourself?

2045
01:31:18,465 --> 01:31:21,224
I am trying to ooze out the
fire he asked for.

2046
01:31:22,131 --> 01:31:24,490
You can blow this fire out.

2047
01:31:24,636 --> 01:31:30,581
You cannot blow out love and
affection Malarvizhi has for me.

2048
01:31:30,811 --> 01:31:32,303
Do something about this

2049
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:33,833
I have an idea.

2050
01:31:34,474 --> 01:31:36,724
Why can't we discuss
it over a beer?

2051
01:31:43,704 --> 01:31:45,399
Malarvizhi my love!

2052
01:31:51,368 --> 01:31:51,868
Dude!

2053
01:31:52,358 --> 01:31:53,905
You know of any beer factory?

2054
01:31:54,171 --> 01:31:55,663
There are totally 8 in our state.

2055
01:31:56,007 --> 01:31:58,486
In Kanchipuram,
Gumudipoondi, Thiruvallur.

2056
01:31:58,884 --> 01:32:01,337
Pudhukottai, Mathuranthagam,
Thirumalisai and a few more.

2057
01:32:01,519 --> 01:32:04,204
Inside the city we have in
Poonamalle and Valasaravakkam.

2058
01:32:04,393 --> 01:32:05,393
Why are you asking?

2059
01:32:05,884 --> 01:32:08,582
We are drinking this everyday.

2060
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:12,246
But have we ever thought about
the process of making it.

2061
01:32:12,558 --> 01:32:15,230
How many people have
strived for this.

2062
01:32:15,307 --> 01:32:17,307
Have we thought about this
on at least labours day.

2063
01:32:18,302 --> 01:32:20,200
We are thankless people.

2064
01:32:21,568 --> 01:32:23,021
That Adyar Undertaker...

2065
01:32:23,310 --> 01:32:26,723
Thinks he is a celebrity and
rejects every girl we show him.

2066
01:32:26,870 --> 01:32:28,870
Your path will open only if
you clear his path.

2067
01:32:28,997 --> 01:32:30,716
My path will open only
if you clear yours.

2068
01:32:30,919 --> 01:32:33,145
My path would open
Malarvizhi's path.

2069
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:35,388
Amidst all these problems we have.

2070
01:32:35,413 --> 01:32:37,874
How can you think
of torturing me?

2071
01:32:38,044 --> 01:32:38,849
Are you an alien?

2072
01:32:39,013 --> 01:32:40,216
I just thought about it.

2073
01:32:40,489 --> 01:32:43,278
Why are you bursting out like
alcohol for that?

2074
01:32:44,582 --> 01:32:46,005
It was uncalled for.

2075
01:32:48,919 --> 01:32:51,215
Mom! Two dosas and one egg dosa

2076
01:32:51,239 --> 01:32:55,344
I have sent you a message. If you forward
it to 40 people, you would get a good wife.

2077
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:57,828
Would I get two girls if I send
it to 80 people?

2078
01:32:58,791 --> 01:32:59,986
I will bash you?

2079
01:33:00,127 --> 01:33:00,627
Hello!

2080
01:33:01,110 --> 01:33:02,110
Hello!

2081
01:33:03,556 --> 01:33:06,126
She is from an older generation.

2082
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:07,431
Why are you pulling her legs?

2083
01:33:07,468 --> 01:33:08,468
One moment.

2084
01:33:09,215 --> 01:33:11,138
You forwarded it to me five times?

2085
01:33:11,403 --> 01:33:15,252
There is a story where people went
on a pilgrimage praying for rain.

2086
01:33:15,651 --> 01:33:17,956
One of the boy alone went
with an umbrella.

2087
01:33:18,027 --> 01:33:18,659
You know why?

2088
01:33:18,830 --> 01:33:21,675
The small boy would have told you
If you had kicked him.

2089
01:33:21,855 --> 01:33:23,917
Why are you asking me?

2090
01:33:24,114 --> 01:33:24,713
That's Belief!

2091
01:33:24,964 --> 01:33:25,964
Belief is everything!

2092
01:33:26,978 --> 01:33:29,462
I suspected you to be an alien.

2093
01:33:29,917 --> 01:33:32,548
But I have confirmed it.

2094
01:33:36,116 --> 01:33:40,451
Dude! I have found the perfect
match for our Undertaker.

2095
01:33:40,498 --> 01:33:41,498
Really?

2096
01:33:41,535 --> 01:33:42,615
Here!

2097
01:33:43,175 --> 01:33:44,175
This?

2098
01:33:44,475 --> 01:33:46,249
Sorry! The status changed.

2099
01:33:47,210 --> 01:33:48,444
Look at this.

2100
01:33:48,539 --> 01:33:50,413
It's our yoga teacher.

2101
01:33:50,499 --> 01:33:53,483
But she is not interested in
marriage and staying single.

2102
01:33:53,515 --> 01:33:54,670
How is it possible?

2103
01:33:54,694 --> 01:33:56,965
If you want to know the status
of someone's mind.

2104
01:33:57,020 --> 01:33:58,950
You just have to see
their Whatspp status.

2105
01:33:59,128 --> 01:34:00,249
Oh is it?

2106
01:34:00,288 --> 01:34:02,481
Look at her status.

2107
01:34:03,317 --> 01:34:05,710
The font is not clear.
You read it out.

2108
01:34:06,178 --> 01:34:08,840
Keep calm! I am waiting for
my perfect match!

2109
01:34:08,898 --> 01:34:09,906
Is it?

2110
01:34:10,157 --> 01:34:11,195
What does it mean?

2111
01:34:11,264 --> 01:34:15,026
It means we have found someone
for our Undertaker.

2112
01:34:15,057 --> 01:34:16,223
And they are "Okay! Okay!"

2113
01:34:16,416 --> 01:34:18,221
Okay! Okay!

2114
01:34:18,275 --> 01:34:20,799
I thought you were an alien.

2115
01:34:21,003 --> 01:34:23,082
But you are an Avatar.

2116
01:34:23,121 --> 01:34:25,225
Here! Cheers!

2117
01:34:33,109 --> 01:34:33,945
These guys?

2118
01:34:34,054 --> 01:34:37,397
What would they do if their pants
tear when bending?

2119
01:34:37,524 --> 01:34:39,133
They would have the
stitching kit ready.

2120
01:34:39,164 --> 01:34:40,149
They would stitch it themselves.

2121
01:34:40,179 --> 01:34:42,351
Won't the needle in the kit poke
if they have it in their pocket?

2122
01:34:42,375 --> 01:34:44,358
Stop talking too much before they
stitch your mouth.

2123
01:34:44,382 --> 01:34:45,984
Check out that grey
yoga pant girl...

2124
01:34:46,102 --> 01:34:46,695
Whoa!

2125
01:34:46,852 --> 01:34:48,234
What a pleasant surprise guys!

2126
01:34:49,297 --> 01:34:50,977
- Good evening ma'am!
- Good morning ma'am!

2127
01:34:51,423 --> 01:34:52,453
- Good morning ma'am!
- Good evening ma'am!

2128
01:34:52,477 --> 01:34:53,587
Can we agree on any one?

2129
01:34:54,334 --> 01:34:55,334
We will go with morning.

2130
01:34:56,655 --> 01:34:58,756
Good morning ma'am!

2131
01:34:58,927 --> 01:35:01,367
How did you guys
remember me suddenly?

2132
01:35:01,411 --> 01:35:03,318
We came to discuss about a marriage.

2133
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:05,529
Marriage! Well congratulations!

2134
01:35:05,647 --> 01:35:09,769
Are you two getting married on the
same day as you told?

2135
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:10,838
Where is my invitation?

2136
01:35:10,995 --> 01:35:13,846
No! We came to you to discuss
your marriage.

2137
01:35:13,924 --> 01:35:15,284
My marriage -Yes!

2138
01:35:15,384 --> 01:35:18,244
How do you guys know that I
want to marry?

2139
01:35:18,330 --> 01:35:20,369
I am in love with a
girl named Thulasi.

2140
01:35:20,613 --> 01:35:23,080
Her father worked in the
Indian Navy for 20 - 25 years.

2141
01:35:23,322 --> 01:35:24,864
Then, he got took voluntary retirement.

2142
01:35:24,888 --> 01:35:26,693
Now he is working as a
professor in a college.

2143
01:35:26,717 --> 01:35:30,052
He is well settled with a own
house, car and good money

2144
01:35:30,276 --> 01:35:31,825
I saw his Whatsapp status yesterday.

2145
01:35:31,849 --> 01:35:34,592
He posted 'I am single.
Waiting for a perfect match'

2146
01:35:34,677 --> 01:35:36,169
He posted it at 12
'O clock yesterday.

2147
01:35:36,193 --> 01:35:37,224
What a coincidence!

2148
01:35:37,342 --> 01:35:38,582
You also had posted a status...

2149
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:42,222
'I am single. Waiting for a
perfect match' at the same time.

2150
01:35:42,246 --> 01:35:43,457
Yeah! So what?

2151
01:35:43,797 --> 01:35:44,297
We thought...

2152
01:35:44,476 --> 01:35:46,328
We could mingle the two singles.

2153
01:35:46,422 --> 01:35:48,517
And change their status to married.

2154
01:35:48,588 --> 01:35:50,101
Got this idea while I was
brushing this morning.

2155
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:51,797
That is why we came here.

2156
01:35:51,882 --> 01:35:53,523
In case if you like him.

2157
01:35:53,687 --> 01:35:55,203
If you accept to marry him.

2158
01:35:55,337 --> 01:35:56,991
Thulasi would agree to marry me.

2159
01:35:57,164 --> 01:35:59,095
My girl Malarvizhi is
also waiting for me.

2160
01:35:59,228 --> 01:36:00,963
If you agree to this.

2161
01:36:00,994 --> 01:36:05,478
Then we would be married on the same
day and same dais as we wished for.

2162
01:36:05,643 --> 01:36:07,210
You started this story.

2163
01:36:07,256 --> 01:36:09,022
Hope you would give
us an happy ending.

2164
01:36:09,169 --> 01:36:10,567
Why are you asking her
about a happy ending?

2165
01:36:10,591 --> 01:36:12,154
Stop your dirty thinking.

2166
01:36:12,455 --> 01:36:14,679
Alright! Since you guys are asking

2167
01:36:14,869 --> 01:36:15,963
I will consider it.

2168
01:36:16,126 --> 01:36:17,277
Do you have his photo?

2169
01:36:17,301 --> 01:36:19,505
I have kept it as my wallpaper.

2170
01:36:19,916 --> 01:36:21,744
Look at this Prince Charming.

2171
01:36:23,002 --> 01:36:24,895
I have seen him somewhere.

2172
01:36:25,212 --> 01:36:26,504
May be in National Geography.

2173
01:36:26,543 --> 01:36:28,534
But I cannot recollect.

2174
01:36:28,558 --> 01:36:31,334
May be in previous birth, like in
Rajamouli's movies.

2175
01:36:31,372 --> 01:36:33,115
Meet him once.

2176
01:36:33,139 --> 01:36:34,407
You will definitely like him.

2177
01:36:35,035 --> 01:36:36,035
Okay!

2178
01:36:36,214 --> 01:36:37,738
Let's meet him tomorrow.

2179
01:36:37,785 --> 01:36:38,285
Awesome!

2180
01:36:38,345 --> 01:36:40,362
Thank you ma'am!

2181
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:44,791
'I can feel the weather change around
me... Girl, it's because of you...'

2182
01:36:44,823 --> 01:36:45,761
Thanks! You too.

2183
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:46,840
He's here.

2184
01:36:47,569 --> 01:36:49,116
Look at him drooling.

2185
01:36:51,517 --> 01:36:54,178
Finally my scoldings have paid off.
They've got someone beautiful!

2186
01:36:54,370 --> 01:36:54,875
Hi sir!

2187
01:36:55,265 --> 01:36:56,484
Meet Ms.Maya!

2188
01:36:56,710 --> 01:36:57,962
Our college Yoga teacher.

2189
01:36:58,563 --> 01:37:00,578
She runs her own Yoga Center in ECR.

2190
01:37:02,037 --> 01:37:03,225
What brings her here?

2191
01:37:03,405 --> 01:37:04,874
There is exhibition going nearby.

2192
01:37:04,975 --> 01:37:07,335
She came to purchase yoga
mats in bulk.

2193
01:37:07,422 --> 01:37:09,298
We stopped to say hi to you.

2194
01:37:09,461 --> 01:37:11,219
Hi uncle!

2195
01:37:12,984 --> 01:37:14,352
She is a single just like you.

2196
01:37:14,416 --> 01:37:15,345
Well settled too.

2197
01:37:15,399 --> 01:37:17,016
She is waiting for
a perfect partner.

2198
01:37:18,369 --> 01:37:19,369
Hi Maya!

2199
01:37:19,556 --> 01:37:21,259
I am Ramachandran -Hi!

2200
01:37:21,782 --> 01:37:23,025
What happened to him?

2201
01:37:23,110 --> 01:37:24,695
He got electrocuted.
Chemistry, it seems!

2202
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:26,719
I thought he got a seizure.

2203
01:37:26,775 --> 01:37:28,073
You are a yoga teacher...

2204
01:37:29,134 --> 01:37:29,660
Mr. Support?

2205
01:37:29,684 --> 01:37:31,614
I'll go and drink some
Sapodilla juice for me.

2206
01:37:31,767 --> 01:37:33,744
There is no Sapodilla at home.
Get it outside.

2207
01:37:34,305 --> 01:37:35,305
Bye dude.

2208
01:37:36,471 --> 01:37:37,471
Then...

2209
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:39,220
Oh! Me too?

2210
01:37:39,517 --> 01:37:41,173
Actually I am not getting signal.

2211
01:37:41,204 --> 01:37:42,861
Dude! One sweet lime juice for me.

2212
01:37:43,007 --> 01:37:45,485
Is it better do yoga in
the morning or evening?

2213
01:37:45,525 --> 01:37:46,767
Morning would be effective.

2214
01:37:46,791 --> 01:37:47,791
Thulasi!

2215
01:37:49,010 --> 01:37:51,174
- Get my Jeep outside.
- Yeah I will.

2216
01:37:51,517 --> 01:37:52,306
We'll continue

2217
01:37:52,391 --> 01:37:53,869
I don't get much
time in the morning.

2218
01:37:53,909 --> 01:37:54,909
Thulasi!

2219
01:37:55,436 --> 01:37:56,878
Can you do it now?

2220
01:37:59,615 --> 01:38:00,615
God!

2221
01:38:01,925 --> 01:38:03,460
You were trying to say something.

2222
01:38:03,663 --> 01:38:04,663
Yes!

2223
01:38:05,396 --> 01:38:06,996
When they told me about
a yoga teacher...

2224
01:38:07,123 --> 01:38:11,841
I expected a Grey haired granny
in fully covered clothes

2225
01:38:12,027 --> 01:38:14,383
I thought I'll say
'Bye' and reject her.

2226
01:38:14,675 --> 01:38:15,675
But you!

2227
01:38:16,464 --> 01:38:17,776
You are fabulous!

2228
01:38:19,186 --> 01:38:21,868
When they told about a
retired navy officer...

2229
01:38:22,104 --> 01:38:25,027
I thought of a man in polo
shirt, grey hair

2230
01:38:25,074 --> 01:38:27,754
sitting on an easy chair and
reading newspaper.

2231
01:38:28,184 --> 01:38:30,779
But you too look fabulous!

2232
01:38:31,708 --> 01:38:33,495
Maya! Beautiful name.

2233
01:38:33,613 --> 01:38:35,722
Sometimes we meet some one
for the first time

2234
01:38:35,982 --> 01:38:38,450
we feel like we have seen
them many times before.

2235
01:38:38,670 --> 01:38:40,373
Looking at you, I can feel it.

2236
01:38:40,989 --> 01:38:42,216
My heart is beating fast

2237
01:38:42,576 --> 01:38:46,833
I have seen a lot of men flirting
pathetically to impress a girl.

2238
01:38:47,154 --> 01:38:51,079
But your ways are cute and cool.

2239
01:38:51,687 --> 01:38:52,758
Ask her.

2240
01:38:52,806 --> 01:38:54,993
Maya! If you are okay

2241
01:38:55,423 --> 01:38:57,493
can we spend a day together?

2242
01:38:58,227 --> 01:39:00,305
Mr. Ramachandran, if you
are fine with it

2243
01:39:00,469 --> 01:39:02,422
can that day be today?

2244
01:39:02,454 --> 01:39:03,970
"A new experience;
As it blossoms..."

2245
01:39:04,188 --> 01:39:08,392
"It makes us fly; Fly so high."

2246
01:39:35,355 --> 01:39:39,277
"You are changing me
with your thoughts."

2247
01:39:39,355 --> 01:39:43,125
"And killing me softly."

2248
01:39:43,562 --> 01:39:47,679
"This world looks new today"

2249
01:39:47,758 --> 01:39:51,081
"I am losing myself in your words."

2250
01:40:09,090 --> 01:40:12,909
"I want to tell you one thing"

2251
01:40:13,166 --> 01:40:17,269
"I want to tell it to your face"

2252
01:40:17,464 --> 01:40:21,050
"I am waiting for that moment."

2253
01:40:21,589 --> 01:40:25,604
"I am feeling my elegance today."

2254
01:40:25,674 --> 01:40:29,627
"Can you feel it too?"

2255
01:40:34,336 --> 01:40:35,883
"Would you be mine?"

2256
01:40:36,125 --> 01:40:38,218
"Would you accept me?"

2257
01:40:42,644 --> 01:40:44,074
"Would you be mine?"

2258
01:40:44,339 --> 01:40:48,808
"Would you accept me now?"

2259
01:40:48,934 --> 01:40:53,480
"Would you accept me now?"

2260
01:40:58,298 --> 01:40:59,978
Stop here.

2261
01:41:01,637 --> 01:41:02,637
Thank you!

2262
01:41:14,710 --> 01:41:16,030
Hi aunty! How are you!

2263
01:41:16,202 --> 01:41:19,046
You are from the mall right?

2264
01:41:19,236 --> 01:41:19,736
Thulasi!

2265
01:41:19,866 --> 01:41:24,101
You have finished every mall and
now going to houses is it?

2266
01:41:24,156 --> 01:41:25,529
No it's not that.

2267
01:41:26,919 --> 01:41:28,497
Where have you hid the camera?

2268
01:41:28,536 --> 01:41:31,044
There is nothing there,
I just came to visit your family.

2269
01:41:31,488 --> 01:41:33,464
Visit us? Why?

2270
01:41:33,519 --> 01:41:36,192
Are you here to give me the
best prank award?

2271
01:41:36,262 --> 01:41:39,371
No! I wanted to see my future home.

2272
01:41:39,824 --> 01:41:41,378
I must step in with
my right foot, isn't it?

2273
01:41:41,402 --> 01:41:43,030
Aravind darling!

2274
01:41:43,109 --> 01:41:44,836
Darling? Whoa!

2275
01:41:45,672 --> 01:41:47,383
When did this happen?

2276
01:41:48,741 --> 01:41:50,261
- Four runs to win.
- You are gone now.

2277
01:41:50,445 --> 01:41:51,834
Wait, I'm coming -Just miss!

2278
01:41:53,670 --> 01:41:55,131
Are you scared of losing?

2279
01:41:55,169 --> 01:41:56,967
There is someone.

2280
01:41:57,287 --> 01:41:57,787
Hi!

2281
01:41:57,904 --> 01:41:59,014
Thulasi!

2282
01:42:00,366 --> 01:42:01,475
What are you guys doing?

2283
01:42:01,954 --> 01:42:03,311
He has some cricket
match in college

2284
01:42:03,335 --> 01:42:04,436
I was training him.

2285
01:42:04,467 --> 01:42:06,600
Brother! Stop making fun.

2286
01:42:06,749 --> 01:42:07,429
Keep quiet.

2287
01:42:07,607 --> 01:42:08,974
How come you are here?

2288
01:42:09,116 --> 01:42:11,819
Just a surprise visit to see you.

2289
01:42:11,843 --> 01:42:13,085
Did your dad call?

2290
01:42:13,170 --> 01:42:14,170
Everything fine?

2291
01:42:14,429 --> 01:42:16,921
Didn't get a call yet, but I thing
everything is going fine.

2292
01:42:18,952 --> 01:42:20,437
Wait a second! Who is she?

2293
01:42:21,725 --> 01:42:22,725
She is...

2294
01:42:22,871 --> 01:42:24,582
This is Thulasi. She is your...

2295
01:42:24,824 --> 01:42:26,902
I am your sister-in-law. You can
call me Thulasi.

2296
01:42:27,863 --> 01:42:29,191
Done!

2297
01:42:29,957 --> 01:42:32,266
What is happening here?

2298
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:35,687
All this fist bumping and stuff?

2299
01:42:35,735 --> 01:42:37,156
She is saying its her future home.

2300
01:42:37,180 --> 01:42:38,523
She says she is the sister-in-law
of Akash.

2301
01:42:38,547 --> 01:42:39,902
Why am I not a part of this?

2302
01:42:39,926 --> 01:42:41,146
Tell me what is happening.

2303
01:42:41,170 --> 01:42:43,341
Mom! Me and Thulasi are

2304
01:42:43,903 --> 01:42:44,903
in love!

2305
01:42:45,185 --> 01:42:46,585
We are planning to
get married soon.

2306
01:42:48,824 --> 01:42:51,068
Look at my son blushing!

2307
01:42:51,614 --> 01:42:53,852
This is a rare sight.

2308
01:42:53,892 --> 01:42:56,228
Make yourself at home.
I'll make some coffee.

2309
01:42:56,252 --> 01:42:57,252
Okay, aunty.

2310
01:42:58,894 --> 01:42:59,894
So?

2311
01:43:00,033 --> 01:43:01,214
Intense practice?

2312
01:43:01,239 --> 01:43:03,155
Are you trying to get
into IPL like Natraj?

2313
01:43:03,257 --> 01:43:04,775
Don't forget me if you
become famous.

2314
01:43:04,822 --> 01:43:05,822
Why?

2315
01:43:06,088 --> 01:43:07,159
Leave me alone!

2316
01:43:07,229 --> 01:43:08,863
Why are you feeling shy?

2317
01:43:11,590 --> 01:43:12,691
It's dad.

2318
01:43:13,026 --> 01:43:14,426
How to manage him?

2319
01:43:14,450 --> 01:43:15,505
Thulasi! Don't go.

2320
01:43:15,553 --> 01:43:17,320
She's going to invite trouble.

2321
01:43:19,091 --> 01:43:20,477
Hi uncle! I am Thulasi.

2322
01:43:20,675 --> 01:43:21,806
Aravind's girlfriend.

2323
01:43:21,946 --> 01:43:23,016
Came for a visit.

2324
01:43:23,446 --> 01:43:24,446
Hi!

2325
01:43:27,133 --> 01:43:28,133
Shanthi!

2326
01:43:32,254 --> 01:43:33,254
Shanthi!

2327
01:43:34,066 --> 01:43:35,223
Dad! I...

2328
01:43:35,344 --> 01:43:36,672
I wanted to introduce her to you.

2329
01:43:36,823 --> 01:43:39,117
This is Thulasi. She just
rushed and introduced herself.

2330
01:43:42,742 --> 01:43:45,562
I knew you would come
from office early.

2331
01:43:45,655 --> 01:43:46,959
So I made some coffee for you.

2332
01:43:47,773 --> 01:43:48,773
Coffee?

2333
01:43:49,421 --> 01:43:50,421
For me?

2334
01:43:51,508 --> 01:43:54,148
Oh! You don't like
coffee, right?

2335
01:43:54,211 --> 01:43:55,242
I forgot.

2336
01:43:55,344 --> 01:43:56,668
- Sorry!
- Move!

2337
01:43:58,145 --> 01:43:59,338
Forgive me

2338
01:43:59,362 --> 01:44:01,348
I got nervous and started blabbing.

2339
01:44:01,418 --> 01:44:02,454
Forgive me -Get lost!

2340
01:44:07,778 --> 01:44:08,996
Coffee -What happened?

2341
01:44:09,059 --> 01:44:10,168
Why is he so angry?

2342
01:44:10,363 --> 01:44:11,809
It's not anger.

2343
01:44:12,203 --> 01:44:16,738
He could not handle
your surprise visit.

2344
01:44:18,738 --> 01:44:19,738
You

2345
01:44:20,092 --> 01:44:23,174
take Thulasi upstairs
and show her around

2346
01:44:23,211 --> 01:44:26,634
I will speak to your dad when he
comes out for dinner and call you.

2347
01:44:26,861 --> 01:44:28,407
Till then don't come near him.

2348
01:44:28,524 --> 01:44:30,049
You will take care right?

2349
01:44:30,119 --> 01:44:31,728
I will handle it.

2350
01:44:32,064 --> 01:44:33,228
That is what scares me

2351
01:44:33,351 --> 01:44:35,362
I am too scared. Just go!

2352
01:44:35,439 --> 01:44:36,720
Let's go to the terrace.

2353
01:44:38,367 --> 01:44:40,725
Lord Muruga! Help
me from a disaster

2354
01:44:40,774 --> 01:44:42,716
I will offer you
prayer this evening.

2355
01:44:43,048 --> 01:44:44,048
Oh Lord!

2356
01:45:02,344 --> 01:45:05,484
I thought you would be late because
of the traffic.

2357
01:45:06,129 --> 01:45:07,556
Shall I go and come back late?

2358
01:45:07,618 --> 01:45:10,953
No! I was just saying...

2359
01:45:10,977 --> 01:45:12,158
You were not just saying..

2360
01:45:12,328 --> 01:45:13,866
But you are trying
to divert the topic!

2361
01:45:17,509 --> 01:45:18,806
Did that girl leave?

2362
01:45:19,424 --> 01:45:22,931
I sent them upstairs so that they
won't be a disturbance while you eat.

2363
01:45:24,188 --> 01:45:25,548
He was telling something to me.

2364
01:45:25,853 --> 01:45:26,853
What is it?

2365
01:45:27,025 --> 01:45:29,165
They are in love it seems.

2366
01:45:30,681 --> 01:45:31,181
So?

2367
01:45:31,469 --> 01:45:33,146
Is this the way to reveal it?

2368
01:45:33,575 --> 01:45:36,946
She wanted to surprise us.

2369
01:45:37,701 --> 01:45:38,763
She's a young girl.

2370
01:45:38,810 --> 01:45:40,622
She's just a playful.

2371
01:45:42,286 --> 01:45:43,286
Shall I call them?

2372
01:45:44,652 --> 01:45:45,652
Aravind!

2373
01:45:46,395 --> 01:45:47,395
Coming mom!

2374
01:45:51,272 --> 01:45:52,272
Aravind! What?

2375
01:45:52,587 --> 01:45:53,623
- Aravind!
- Tell me.

2376
01:45:53,907 --> 01:45:56,325
Why's you FB relationship
status still 'Single?'

2377
01:45:56,349 --> 01:45:57,911
Quiet!

2378
01:45:57,942 --> 01:45:59,542
- Answer me!
- Like that's important now!

2379
01:46:04,786 --> 01:46:05,583
What do you do?

2380
01:46:05,762 --> 01:46:09,037
I have done Visual communication
and working at a private channel.

2381
01:46:09,227 --> 01:46:11,131
You would have seen me on TV.

2382
01:46:12,053 --> 01:46:12,553
No!

2383
01:46:12,623 --> 01:46:13,780
I don't watch TV.

2384
01:46:15,725 --> 01:46:17,493
Do your parents know you are here?

2385
01:46:18,219 --> 01:46:22,015
I don't need my dad's
permission for anything.

2386
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:23,790
If I call him now at this hour

2387
01:46:23,954 --> 01:46:25,077
he would get furious.

2388
01:46:25,177 --> 01:46:27,615
- He knows about it. Tell your dad.
- Quiet.

2389
01:46:27,701 --> 01:46:30,186
Her father already knows.
He is okay with us.

2390
01:46:30,615 --> 01:46:32,193
Your food is getting cold.

2391
01:46:35,317 --> 01:46:36,317
Had dinner?

2392
01:46:37,427 --> 01:46:38,217
Uncle!

2393
01:46:38,435 --> 01:46:41,842
No one has asked me this
since I came here.

2394
01:46:42,084 --> 01:46:43,232
Only you asked me.

2395
01:46:43,637 --> 01:46:44,919
You are my favourite.

2396
01:46:45,372 --> 01:46:46,990
Today my dinner is with you.

2397
01:46:47,608 --> 01:46:49,858
- Thulasi listen.
- Don't talk to me.

2398
01:46:50,147 --> 01:46:51,796
Did you ask if I was hungry?

2399
01:46:51,838 --> 01:46:53,469
Thulasi!

2400
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:55,070
Don't do it.

2401
01:46:55,483 --> 01:46:55,983
Aunty!

2402
01:46:56,284 --> 01:46:57,898
Don't worry if the food is less.

2403
01:46:57,932 --> 01:46:59,531
We can share the food and manage.

2404
01:46:59,758 --> 01:47:00,758
Give me a chapati.

2405
01:47:02,586 --> 01:47:03,586
Okay!

2406
01:47:04,577 --> 01:47:05,734
Come join us.

2407
01:47:07,375 --> 01:47:08,375
Okay.

2408
01:47:08,827 --> 01:47:09,827
One moment!

2409
01:47:10,584 --> 01:47:11,584
You need something.

2410
01:47:11,905 --> 01:47:13,663
You are here for the first time.

2411
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:15,561
Don't you know how to behave?

2412
01:47:16,170 --> 01:47:17,483
Didn't you learn any manners?

2413
01:47:18,349 --> 01:47:20,413
What's wrong with my
behaviour, uncle?

2414
01:47:20,538 --> 01:47:22,280
I was just being casual.

2415
01:47:23,443 --> 01:47:24,443
Casual?

2416
01:47:25,655 --> 01:47:27,015
Don't you have any elders at home?

2417
01:47:27,608 --> 01:47:29,179
Your mom and dad are
working, is it?

2418
01:47:30,085 --> 01:47:31,085
No!

2419
01:47:31,401 --> 01:47:32,401
I have only my dad.

2420
01:47:32,902 --> 01:47:34,450
I lost my mom when I was a kid.

2421
01:47:37,542 --> 01:47:38,542
Look!

2422
01:47:38,996 --> 01:47:40,096
This proves her behaviour.

2423
01:47:40,628 --> 01:47:43,629
If the elder's don't teach their
children at home.

2424
01:47:44,128 --> 01:47:45,825
You will get a spoilt one like her.

2425
01:47:50,911 --> 01:47:51,911
Uncle!

2426
01:47:52,409 --> 01:47:53,925
Sorry if I did something wrong.

2427
01:47:56,357 --> 01:47:57,451
Hold on a second.

2428
01:47:57,661 --> 01:47:58,661
Hold on.

2429
01:47:59,318 --> 01:47:59,818
Dad!

2430
01:48:00,310 --> 01:48:01,832
Thulasi is the girl
am going to marry.

2431
01:48:01,878 --> 01:48:03,478
She will live with me
here in the future.

2432
01:48:03,599 --> 01:48:05,423
Humiliating someone at the face.

2433
01:48:05,503 --> 01:48:07,026
Hurting people with words.

2434
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:10,572
Limit all your other rules and
conditions with your wife.

2435
01:48:11,039 --> 01:48:12,805
Do not cross the limit.

2436
01:48:13,321 --> 01:48:15,236
If you do then I'll won't
hold myself back...

2437
01:48:17,112 --> 01:48:18,112
And do what?

2438
01:48:18,580 --> 01:48:19,603
What will you do?

2439
01:48:20,237 --> 01:48:21,620
Will you hit me? Come on do it.

2440
01:48:24,594 --> 01:48:25,594
Oh God!

2441
01:48:28,204 --> 01:48:30,797
Do you think you're a man
if a girl enters your life?

2442
01:48:31,672 --> 01:48:33,563
You forgot who you are speaking to?

2443
01:48:33,915 --> 01:48:35,071
Apologise to your dad.

2444
01:48:36,125 --> 01:48:37,165
Apologise!

2445
01:48:37,204 --> 01:48:38,204
Shut up mom!

2446
01:48:38,789 --> 01:48:40,960
I can't bear his attitude like you.

2447
01:48:41,375 --> 01:48:44,036
It's your fate to suffer with him.

2448
01:48:45,055 --> 01:48:46,375
What are you talking?

2449
01:48:46,461 --> 01:48:48,790
Then? Humiliating someone
at the dinner table?

2450
01:48:48,822 --> 01:48:50,119
Mocking her parents

2451
01:48:50,385 --> 01:48:51,785
I can't see all these and be quiet.

2452
01:48:52,518 --> 01:48:54,086
Aravind don't -Leave me.

2453
01:48:55,046 --> 01:48:58,523
If some one insults my girl,
I would confront them.

2454
01:48:58,740 --> 01:49:00,479
If she is in trouble,
I would fight for her.

2455
01:49:00,511 --> 01:49:03,680
Because I am not like your husband.

2456
01:49:04,758 --> 01:49:05,758
Let's leave.

2457
01:49:32,096 --> 01:49:33,096
Sorry!

2458
01:49:33,518 --> 01:49:36,003
On my first visit to your house,
fight broke out with your dad.

2459
01:49:36,206 --> 01:49:37,648
It makes me sad.

2460
01:49:37,851 --> 01:49:38,960
No need to be sad.

2461
01:49:39,006 --> 01:49:41,445
This happens every time with him.

2462
01:49:41,502 --> 01:49:42,533
That is his character.

2463
01:49:45,405 --> 01:49:48,334
What if he doesn't agree
to our marriage now?

2464
01:49:48,498 --> 01:49:50,138
Why do we need his permission?

2465
01:49:50,232 --> 01:49:53,317
Our marriage will happen whether
he likes it or not.

2466
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:54,709
Try to understand!

2467
01:49:54,811 --> 01:49:57,207
His first impression of me was bad.

2468
01:49:57,365 --> 01:49:59,090
How can we stay in the same
house together?

2469
01:50:02,614 --> 01:50:03,699
Hello -Brother!

2470
01:50:03,957 --> 01:50:04,457
Tell me.

2471
01:50:04,497 --> 01:50:06,489
Mom suddenly fell down unconscious.

2472
01:50:06,911 --> 01:50:08,191
We has admitted her in hospital.

2473
01:50:08,676 --> 01:50:09,504
What?

2474
01:50:09,630 --> 01:50:11,395
I am scared. Please come here soon.

2475
01:50:11,426 --> 01:50:12,044
Which hospital?

2476
01:50:12,098 --> 01:50:13,575
Bewell hospital at Koyambedu.

2477
01:50:13,708 --> 01:50:14,708
Come soon.

2478
01:50:14,833 --> 01:50:15,833
Will be right there.

2479
01:50:16,341 --> 01:50:17,341
What happened?

2480
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:18,935
Mom is not well.

2481
01:50:19,505 --> 01:50:20,654
Admitted in hospital.

2482
01:50:20,842 --> 01:50:21,919
You go home

2483
01:50:22,231 --> 01:50:23,231
I'll check on her.

2484
01:50:23,552 --> 01:50:24,677
Please stop.

2485
01:50:25,403 --> 01:50:26,652
All because of me

2486
01:50:26,847 --> 01:50:28,331
I will take care of it.

2487
01:50:28,355 --> 01:50:29,355
Stop it there.

2488
01:50:29,550 --> 01:50:31,800
- Please drop her home safely.
- Okay

2489
01:50:31,825 --> 01:50:34,178
- I will come with you.
- You go, I will call you later.

2490
01:50:39,467 --> 01:50:40,467
Brother!

2491
01:50:41,311 --> 01:50:42,311
What happened?

2492
01:50:42,366 --> 01:50:44,069
Mom and dad were in the room

2493
01:50:44,147 --> 01:50:46,421
I was in the hall. I don't know
what happened inside.

2494
01:50:46,562 --> 01:50:48,531
Dad suddenly shouted out to me

2495
01:50:48,601 --> 01:50:50,984
I ran in and saw mom
unconscious on the floor.

2496
01:50:51,562 --> 01:50:53,968
I called an ambulance
and brought her here.

2497
01:50:54,724 --> 01:50:55,724
Where is he?

2498
01:50:55,918 --> 01:50:57,442
He is upstairs.

2499
01:50:57,849 --> 01:50:59,685
I am scared.

2500
01:50:59,997 --> 01:51:02,263
- Don't be scared.
- Mom will be fine right?

2501
01:51:02,310 --> 01:51:03,313
Nothing will happen.

2502
01:51:03,567 --> 01:51:04,781
Don't worry -Okay!

2503
01:51:05,249 --> 01:51:06,836
I will get the medicines.

2504
01:51:08,023 --> 01:51:09,023
Be strong.

2505
01:51:09,344 --> 01:51:10,961
Everything will be alright.

2506
01:51:25,639 --> 01:51:26,639
Come!

2507
01:51:27,084 --> 01:51:28,244
She was talking to just fine.

2508
01:51:28,290 --> 01:51:29,998
- Did you scold her?
- Suddenly she fell down unconscious

2509
01:51:30,022 --> 01:51:32,444
- I didn't scold her.
- You hit her then?

2510
01:51:32,944 --> 01:51:34,249
Why are you talking like this?

2511
01:51:34,506 --> 01:51:36,834
You humiliate her for
even small things.

2512
01:51:37,022 --> 01:51:39,660
You want me to believe you did
nothing after the incident tonight.

2513
01:51:39,739 --> 01:51:41,129
You would have definitely hit her

2514
01:51:41,231 --> 01:51:42,997
I did nothing -Shut your mouth.

2515
01:51:44,911 --> 01:51:46,200
Just out of curiosity.

2516
01:51:46,332 --> 01:51:49,476
You humiliate and embarrass
her at every chance you get.

2517
01:51:49,610 --> 01:51:51,032
How much will you put her through?

2518
01:51:51,065 --> 01:51:52,733
Do you think she's your slave?

2519
01:51:53,366 --> 01:51:57,038
If some other woman was in her place,
they would have left you long ago!

2520
01:51:57,357 --> 01:51:59,181
- Aravind, I...
- Shut up, dad!

2521
01:52:01,688 --> 01:52:03,056
She will be fine.

2522
01:52:03,081 --> 01:52:03,954
Not a word more.

2523
01:52:03,978 --> 01:52:05,678
If anything happens to her.

2524
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:08,035
I won't spare you.

2525
01:52:08,632 --> 01:52:10,897
Who is here for Shanthi Natarajan?

2526
01:52:12,004 --> 01:52:14,138
I am Natarajan. Shanthi's husband.

2527
01:52:14,505 --> 01:52:15,654
She has woke up.

2528
01:52:15,732 --> 01:52:17,888
One of you can go in
without disturbing her.

2529
01:52:18,926 --> 01:52:19,505
Why?

2530
01:52:19,787 --> 01:52:21,783
So that she'll see you
and faint again in fear?

2531
01:52:21,885 --> 01:52:22,916
She is my wife!

2532
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:26,650
You realize that only now?

2533
01:52:27,275 --> 01:52:29,291
I want to know what
happened at home.

2534
01:52:29,611 --> 01:52:31,236
She won't speak if you are there.

2535
01:52:31,649 --> 01:52:32,649
I'll go.

2536
01:52:32,798 --> 01:52:34,361
You stay here.

2537
01:52:41,986 --> 01:52:42,986
Mom!

2538
01:52:44,908 --> 01:52:45,908
Aravind!

2539
01:52:46,864 --> 01:52:47,864
What happened?

2540
01:52:47,930 --> 01:52:48,930
Are you alright?

2541
01:52:49,430 --> 01:52:50,430
How are you?

2542
01:52:50,954 --> 01:52:52,266
Am perfectly alright.

2543
01:52:52,352 --> 01:52:53,446
Am doing fine.

2544
01:52:53,751 --> 01:52:57,110
The hospital is trying to extract
money from us with all these set up.

2545
01:52:57,252 --> 01:52:59,212
Don't fall for it and pay the bill.

2546
01:52:59,469 --> 01:53:01,055
Mom! Leave that.

2547
01:53:01,313 --> 01:53:02,313
What happened at home?

2548
01:53:02,961 --> 01:53:03,961
Did he scold you?

2549
01:53:05,062 --> 01:53:06,062
Did he hit you?

2550
01:53:07,141 --> 01:53:08,528
- Why are quiet?
- I'll tell you.

2551
01:53:17,303 --> 01:53:20,709
After you left with that girl.

2552
01:53:20,851 --> 01:53:21,851
Yeah!

2553
01:53:21,913 --> 01:53:24,641
I had a headache,
so I went to sleep.

2554
01:53:24,704 --> 01:53:27,000
You know what happened then?

2555
01:53:52,033 --> 01:53:54,572
Sorry, I stamped you by mistake!

2556
01:53:54,627 --> 01:53:56,729
Forgive me! Wont happen again!

2557
01:53:56,861 --> 01:53:58,580
- It's not that.
- You want some tea?

2558
01:53:58,941 --> 01:54:00,152
How about black tea?

2559
01:54:00,198 --> 01:54:00,698
No!

2560
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:02,705
Are you having head ache?
Shall I apply pain balm.

2561
01:54:02,729 --> 01:54:04,285
Nothing! Can you please sit.

2562
01:54:04,342 --> 01:54:05,363
Why?

2563
01:54:05,659 --> 01:54:07,066
I said sit down!

2564
01:54:12,141 --> 01:54:13,141
Sorry!

2565
01:54:15,336 --> 01:54:17,976
What is this? Sounds new to me.

2566
01:54:20,570 --> 01:54:21,640
Had your food?

2567
01:54:28,595 --> 01:54:31,488
What? I didn't hear you.

2568
01:54:32,793 --> 01:54:34,762
I asked did you had your food?

2569
01:54:37,698 --> 01:54:38,698
Something's...

2570
01:54:38,754 --> 01:54:40,636
My ears are blocking.

2571
01:54:42,260 --> 01:54:44,058
My heart is beating faster

2572
01:54:44,089 --> 01:54:46,638
I'm unable to hear
what you are saying...

2573
01:54:46,988 --> 01:54:49,105
Well, dear... I just asked
if you had your food?

2574
01:54:49,184 --> 01:54:50,872
Oh my God!

2575
01:54:51,025 --> 01:54:52,400
Shanthi!

2576
01:54:52,877 --> 01:54:53,877
Shanthi!

2577
01:54:54,306 --> 01:54:55,306
Akash!

2578
01:54:56,721 --> 01:54:57,721
So, that's...

2579
01:54:57,767 --> 01:54:58,267
What?

2580
01:54:58,611 --> 01:54:59,611
Him?

2581
01:55:00,259 --> 01:55:01,745
Yes!

2582
01:55:04,673 --> 01:55:07,251
In our 30 years of marriage...

2583
01:55:07,890 --> 01:55:09,840
It is the first time...

2584
01:55:10,161 --> 01:55:11,935
He has asked me if I had food?

2585
01:55:15,115 --> 01:55:17,307
I was overjoyed.

2586
01:55:19,556 --> 01:55:21,323
I cannot explain it.

2587
01:55:23,636 --> 01:55:27,467
My ears blocked and
my heart pounded.

2588
01:55:28,427 --> 01:55:30,459
And I fell unconscious.

2589
01:55:31,677 --> 01:55:32,677
Mom!

2590
01:55:32,989 --> 01:55:34,216
Why is he like this?

2591
01:55:34,608 --> 01:55:35,984
What is his problem?

2592
01:55:36,428 --> 01:55:38,881
He had a girlfriend
during his college days.

2593
01:55:40,909 --> 01:55:41,920
Like in movies?

2594
01:55:43,449 --> 01:55:45,965
Looks like that girl was
too modern and stylish.

2595
01:55:46,057 --> 01:55:48,932
But his father forced
him to marry me.

2596
01:55:49,401 --> 01:55:52,346
That is why he is
always angry at me.

2597
01:55:52,424 --> 01:55:54,643
And later he got used to it.

2598
01:55:55,206 --> 01:55:56,206
Leave that!

2599
01:55:59,002 --> 01:56:02,869
For the first time my husband
has shown some care on me.

2600
01:56:03,369 --> 01:56:04,611
That's all I need.

2601
01:56:08,102 --> 01:56:09,102
Here he comes.

2602
01:56:11,761 --> 01:56:12,761
Be seated.

2603
01:56:16,206 --> 01:56:17,206
Shanthi!

2604
01:56:19,181 --> 01:56:22,843
In all these years of our marriage

2605
01:56:23,141 --> 01:56:25,108
I was a fool to have
been very rude to you.

2606
01:56:26,461 --> 01:56:27,703
But not anymore.

2607
01:56:29,663 --> 01:56:30,663
Forgive me!

2608
01:56:33,267 --> 01:56:34,781
Is this coming from you?

2609
01:56:35,575 --> 01:56:37,395
I cannot believe it.

2610
01:56:38,043 --> 01:56:39,043
It's not me.

2611
01:56:40,614 --> 01:56:44,114
When I insulted her girl
in front of everyone

2612
01:56:45,349 --> 01:56:47,326
he stood his ground and
fought with me for her.

2613
01:56:48,177 --> 01:56:50,888
That was slap and
reality check for me.

2614
01:56:52,433 --> 01:56:53,818
All these years...

2615
01:56:54,468 --> 01:56:58,468
How much have I insulted you?

2616
01:56:59,703 --> 01:57:01,742
And you'd have been desperate

2617
01:57:02,226 --> 01:57:04,706
to hear some sweet and
nice words from me.

2618
01:57:05,690 --> 01:57:09,385
It took me all these
years for me to do it.

2619
01:57:11,055 --> 01:57:14,000
I feel disgusted about me.

2620
01:57:17,102 --> 01:57:18,180
I tell you now.

2621
01:57:18,962 --> 01:57:20,611
Until my last breath...

2622
01:57:22,722 --> 01:57:25,566
I won't let her down again

2623
01:57:25,902 --> 01:57:27,152
I won't hurt her.

2624
01:57:27,590 --> 01:57:29,334
I will treat her like a queen.

2625
01:57:31,825 --> 01:57:32,825
Usually

2626
01:57:34,168 --> 01:57:36,215
youngsters learn from elders.

2627
01:57:36,810 --> 01:57:38,525
But I have learnt from you.

2628
01:57:38,938 --> 01:57:40,861
Dad! Forgive me.

2629
01:57:40,908 --> 01:57:42,593
No! You were right.

2630
01:57:43,908 --> 01:57:44,908
You have your phone?

2631
01:57:45,994 --> 01:57:47,143
Yes! Why?

2632
01:57:47,387 --> 01:57:48,692
I want to take a selfie.

2633
01:57:49,666 --> 01:57:51,330
I will take a selfie.

2634
01:57:51,931 --> 01:57:53,526
No! I want a selfie with my wife.

2635
01:57:53,901 --> 01:57:54,901
Give the phone.

2636
01:57:55,912 --> 01:57:57,056
Here have it.

2637
01:58:01,007 --> 01:58:02,038
Move aside.

2638
01:58:08,435 --> 01:58:10,614
One for my Whatsapp display picture.

2639
01:58:11,856 --> 01:58:13,506
Can we erase the background?

2640
01:58:13,813 --> 01:58:15,931
Dad! Enough selfies for one day.

2641
01:58:16,298 --> 01:58:17,329
Thank God for the phone.

2642
01:58:17,415 --> 01:58:18,415
Dude! Tell me.

2643
01:58:18,634 --> 01:58:20,009
How is mom?

2644
01:58:20,165 --> 01:58:21,243
She is okay.

2645
01:58:21,337 --> 01:58:23,179
Dude! If you want to see me alive.

2646
01:58:23,366 --> 01:58:24,936
Come to Maya teacher's house now.

2647
01:58:25,085 --> 01:58:26,085
What are you saying?

2648
01:58:26,686 --> 01:58:29,944
What were you guys planning? I am a
fool to believe you two.

2649
01:58:30,657 --> 01:58:32,728
Why are you hitting me now?

2650
01:58:32,845 --> 01:58:34,384
You asking why? Come here! Come!

2651
01:58:34,423 --> 01:58:36,423
I might get hurt in wrong place.
I'm still single!

2652
01:58:36,493 --> 01:58:37,610
I'll come but you should
not hit me.

2653
01:58:37,634 --> 01:58:38,829
Where is your friend?

2654
01:58:39,376 --> 01:58:39,876
Where is he?

2655
01:58:40,290 --> 01:58:41,649
I called him. He'll be
here in two minutes.

2656
01:58:41,673 --> 01:58:44,899
Ask him to come soon. He is
the reason for all this.

2657
01:58:45,044 --> 01:58:47,645
- Will you leave me if he comes?
- I will kill you.

2658
01:58:47,700 --> 01:58:50,381
Stop hitting me!
Quiet! He is here.

2659
01:58:50,514 --> 01:58:51,569
Let him come.

2660
01:58:52,928 --> 01:58:54,647
Is my face looking good?

2661
01:58:54,741 --> 01:58:56,217
I will bust it open.

2662
01:59:01,085 --> 01:59:02,631
Keep calm and maintain
the excitement.

2663
01:59:04,710 --> 01:59:06,624
Dude! Come on in.

2664
01:59:06,827 --> 01:59:07,765
What happened?

2665
01:59:07,789 --> 01:59:09,022
I called you just like that.

2666
01:59:09,341 --> 01:59:10,957
Maya ma'am called
me over for drinks

2667
01:59:11,003 --> 01:59:14,019
I know you would like some too.
Let's party

2668
01:59:14,168 --> 01:59:15,535
I rushed here after your call.

2669
01:59:15,652 --> 01:59:16,332
You dumb fool!

2670
01:59:16,659 --> 01:59:18,425
Oh you are busy is it? Then leave.

2671
01:59:18,450 --> 01:59:20,650
- Come back when you are free.
- No! I was just kidding.

2672
01:59:20,683 --> 01:59:23,207
Mom just got discharged!
I would like to have a drink

2673
01:59:23,277 --> 01:59:24,293
with Maya teacher.

2674
01:59:25,261 --> 01:59:27,698
I can see the glow in your face.

2675
01:59:27,753 --> 01:59:28,902
Come let's party!

2676
01:59:29,049 --> 01:59:29,752
The door?

2677
01:59:29,791 --> 01:59:31,151
Let it be open, for ventilation.

2678
01:59:31,198 --> 01:59:33,238
- Oh! The yoga students are coming too?
- Of course.

2679
01:59:33,401 --> 01:59:34,502
Then why did she call you?

2680
01:59:35,033 --> 01:59:36,572
Hi Maya... ma'am!

2681
01:59:36,618 --> 01:59:37,706
Get ready for the storm!

2682
01:59:37,831 --> 01:59:39,231
What happened to you?

2683
01:59:39,378 --> 01:59:40,855
Something bad happened?

2684
01:59:40,916 --> 01:59:41,902
You'll know.

2685
01:59:41,932 --> 01:59:44,283
Why is the house messy?
Didn't you call house keeping?

2686
01:59:44,369 --> 01:59:45,665
Oh! You want house keeping?

2687
01:59:45,696 --> 01:59:47,665
You want me to call
the house keeping?

2688
01:59:47,752 --> 01:59:48,556
Why is she hitting me?

2689
01:59:48,580 --> 01:59:49,181
Come here!

2690
01:59:49,213 --> 01:59:50,471
- Talk to us before hitting.
- Come here.

2691
01:59:50,495 --> 01:59:52,323
This is why I called you.
Deal with her.

2692
01:59:52,676 --> 01:59:53,885
Who is that Ramachandran?

2693
01:59:53,924 --> 01:59:56,127
'Hi Maya! Call me Rams'

2694
01:59:56,152 --> 01:59:58,487
If I meet him again, he'll be dead

2695
01:59:58,517 --> 02:00:02,282
I thought she was a posh yoga master but
she acts like a roadside parotta master.

2696
02:00:02,354 --> 02:00:04,593
Who are you calling
a parotta master?

2697
02:00:04,639 --> 02:00:06,994
Dude! Stop provoking her!
Keep quiet.

2698
02:00:07,635 --> 02:00:09,557
Ma'am! Calm down a second.

2699
02:00:09,682 --> 02:00:11,721
Relax, ma'am. Here this way.

2700
02:00:12,229 --> 02:00:12,729
Sit

2701
02:00:12,947 --> 02:00:14,896
I didn't know it was so
easy to calm you down.

2702
02:00:15,060 --> 02:00:17,498
As a yoga master,
you should know it.

2703
02:00:17,589 --> 02:00:20,529
So calm down, take a deep breathe
and tell us what happened.

2704
02:00:20,810 --> 02:00:22,090
Explain us what happened, ma'am?

2705
02:00:22,802 --> 02:00:26,732
He roamed all over ECR and
Mahabalipuram with me and

2706
02:00:26,818 --> 02:00:28,668
we had a good time as
he dropped me off at home.

2707
02:00:28,692 --> 02:00:29,692
And then...

2708
02:00:32,365 --> 02:00:33,365
Okay!

2709
02:00:34,716 --> 02:00:36,607
Wait! I'll come that side.

2710
02:00:36,755 --> 02:00:38,904
"Life is very short my friend."

2711
02:00:39,310 --> 02:00:41,365
"Always be happy."

2712
02:00:41,825 --> 02:00:42,825
Come in!

2713
02:00:47,592 --> 02:00:49,504
Spending this whole day with you...

2714
02:00:50,042 --> 02:00:51,331
I really had a good time.

2715
02:00:51,901 --> 02:00:54,940
I am sad that this day
is ending so soon.

2716
02:00:55,871 --> 02:00:58,580
This winter season
keeps changing my mood.

2717
02:00:58,634 --> 02:01:00,088
You are so naughty, Ram.

2718
02:01:00,580 --> 02:01:02,595
While we are in this good mood...

2719
02:01:02,869 --> 02:01:04,200
I will ask you one more thing.

2720
02:01:04,360 --> 02:01:07,828
Just like we spent the
whole day together.

2721
02:01:07,938 --> 02:01:10,063
Similarly, can we spend
a full night together?

2722
02:01:10,150 --> 02:01:15,974
I mean, it would make us go deep
and understand ourselves better.

2723
02:01:16,979 --> 02:01:20,822
Just give me a call and tell me
when and where, I'll come rushing.

2724
02:01:20,946 --> 02:01:23,220
If you need some money.

2725
02:01:23,330 --> 02:01:25,843
How much ever it is,
don't hesitate to call me

2726
02:01:26,211 --> 02:01:27,703
I will send the money.

2727
02:01:28,164 --> 02:01:30,070
"You are changing me with your thoughts."

2728
02:01:30,170 --> 02:01:32,412
"My sweety". Goodnight!

2729
02:01:36,963 --> 02:01:37,963
Crap!

2730
02:01:38,416 --> 02:01:40,794
He asked me to spend
a night with him

2731
02:01:40,964 --> 02:01:42,573
I can forgive that.

2732
02:01:42,597 --> 02:01:45,902
But he offered me money...

2733
02:01:45,981 --> 02:01:47,028
Bloody idiot!

2734
02:01:47,083 --> 02:01:48,786
What is he thinking about me?

2735
02:01:48,942 --> 02:01:50,575
Police commissioner's
wife is my student.

2736
02:01:50,606 --> 02:01:54,044
One phone and he will be
in jail in his underpants.

2737
02:01:54,069 --> 02:01:55,959
- You want me to prove it?
- No I don't.

2738
02:01:56,006 --> 02:01:58,381
It would be disgusting to
see him in underpants.

2739
02:01:58,553 --> 02:02:01,569
Ma'am! He is a cheap guy.
Forgive him and move forward.

2740
02:02:01,639 --> 02:02:04,578
No! Don't spare him. Let
us put him in prison!

2741
02:02:06,409 --> 02:02:08,652
He might have had some other
idea about you.

2742
02:02:10,176 --> 02:02:11,176
Ma'am!

2743
02:02:12,723 --> 02:02:14,598
Even if you forgive that
'Adyar Undertaker'

2744
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:16,021
we won't forgive him.

2745
02:02:16,466 --> 02:02:18,083
We will choke him to death!

2746
02:02:18,566 --> 02:02:20,432
You do your breathing
exercises for now.

2747
02:02:20,517 --> 02:02:21,610
We will take care of him.

2748
02:02:21,665 --> 02:02:22,572
Let's go.

2749
02:02:22,596 --> 02:02:24,233
You relax ma'am!

2750
02:02:24,288 --> 02:02:25,908
Come on! You relax ma'am!

2751
02:02:26,145 --> 02:02:28,979
Ma'am! Hold this state of calm.

2752
02:02:29,167 --> 02:02:31,628
We will catch hold
of that old geezer.

2753
02:02:33,835 --> 02:02:35,195
Let me breathe in and breathe out.

2754
02:02:40,504 --> 02:02:44,043
The Yoga teacher is
driving me crazy

2755
02:02:44,285 --> 02:02:45,747
Why hasn't she called yet?

2756
02:02:46,395 --> 02:02:48,567
Dad, you're not letting me play

2757
02:02:49,020 --> 02:02:49,755
You're driving me crazy!

2758
02:02:49,903 --> 02:02:51,677
What's so upsetting about
playing video game?

2759
02:02:51,911 --> 02:02:53,645
You have no idea what's
driving me crazy

2760
02:02:53,835 --> 02:02:55,286
What's driving you crazy, dad?

2761
02:02:55,622 --> 02:02:58,052
I was most nervous when
you're mom was delivering you

2762
02:02:58,349 --> 02:03:00,309
But this is even worse...

2763
02:03:01,098 --> 02:03:01,598
Dad...

2764
02:03:02,426 --> 02:03:03,176
what happened?

2765
02:03:03,488 --> 02:03:04,497
Any issue at the college?

2766
02:03:04,895 --> 02:03:07,341
I never take any college
issue to my head

2767
02:03:07,551 --> 02:03:09,061
Are you feeling sick?

2768
02:03:09,257 --> 02:03:10,983
-Shall I call the ambulance?
-Wait, dear

2769
02:03:11,061 --> 02:03:12,655
Why is ambulance always
your first choice?

2770
02:03:12,788 --> 02:03:14,921
-Can't you keep quiet?
-Then what's the problem?

2771
02:03:15,710 --> 02:03:16,483
Well, that...

2772
02:03:17,093 --> 02:03:17,794
Maya...

2773
02:03:18,622 --> 02:03:19,913
I can't tell you that. Forget it

2774
02:03:20,161 --> 02:03:20,661
Dad!

2775
02:03:21,091 --> 02:03:23,591
You'll share everything
with Aravind but not me?

2776
02:03:24,091 --> 02:03:25,320
Well, I share with him because...

2777
02:03:26,177 --> 02:03:28,771
The pill for my tension is here.
Wait, dear. I'll be back

2778
02:03:28,888 --> 02:03:29,607
Maya!

2779
02:03:30,115 --> 02:03:30,990
Maya darli...

2780
02:03:31,537 --> 02:03:32,864
Sir, what are you looking for, sir?

2781
02:03:32,949 --> 02:03:35,106
-Where is she?
-Don't turn around

2782
02:03:36,438 --> 02:03:38,538
I'll remove my slipper and...

2783
02:03:38,985 --> 02:03:39,813
beat myself!

2784
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:41,594
Careful, there might be cow dung on it

2785
02:03:41,828 --> 02:03:42,867
What's that noise?

2786
02:03:42,946 --> 02:03:44,411
Don't near him. He might bite you

2787
02:03:44,521 --> 02:03:46,263
Anybody there? Talk to me!

2788
02:03:47,514 --> 02:03:49,428
Why is he look at the
ceiling and talking?

2789
02:03:49,459 --> 02:03:50,061
Nothing...

2790
02:03:50,467 --> 02:03:51,157
It's normal

2791
02:03:52,053 --> 02:03:52,834
Well, sir...

2792
02:03:53,022 --> 02:03:54,553
while coming from
outside at midnight..

2793
02:03:54,592 --> 02:03:56,967
sometimes a witch will tag along.
My granny told me this

2794
02:03:57,092 --> 02:03:58,607
You also gave a suspicious look

2795
02:03:58,701 --> 02:03:59,881
So I was trying to get
rid of witch, if any

2796
02:04:00,014 --> 02:04:00,967
It's a self defense, you know?

2797
02:04:01,006 --> 02:04:03,639
-Neighbours need exorcist not us
-Sir! Sir! Hold on!

2798
02:04:03,772 --> 02:04:06,228
Sir, get ready. We need to
visit an important place

2799
02:04:06,259 --> 02:04:07,548
Where? Why must I get ready?

2800
02:04:08,212 --> 02:04:09,728
Did you propose anything
to Maya madam?

2801
02:04:10,118 --> 02:04:10,665
Whoa, ye...

2802
02:04:12,220 --> 02:04:14,721
You go and continue playing
your video game. Go!

2803
02:04:14,924 --> 02:04:16,502
Look how he's reacting
on hearing her name

2804
02:04:16,588 --> 02:04:17,572
So she told you?

2805
02:04:17,656 --> 02:04:18,776
She didn't tell me

2806
02:04:18,908 --> 02:04:20,283
She wants to meet you in
secret regarding that

2807
02:04:20,306 --> 02:04:22,432
So she asked us to blindfold
you and bring to her

2808
02:04:22,557 --> 02:04:24,164
You mean blindfolded?

2809
02:04:24,719 --> 02:04:27,016
Whoa! I love that game!

2810
02:04:27,094 --> 02:04:28,571
I'll be ready in a jiffy

2811
02:04:31,406 --> 02:04:33,469
-Thanks a lot
-This is the location

2812
02:04:33,630 --> 02:04:35,138
Though it's dark here...

2813
02:04:35,216 --> 02:04:36,816
once in room, there'll be light

2814
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:38,106
By the time we take him there...

2815
02:04:38,746 --> 02:04:39,795
Get him

2816
02:04:40,177 --> 02:04:42,025
The proverb is "Blindfolded
and left in forest"

2817
02:04:42,251 --> 02:04:44,634
But you guys have blindfolded
me and taking me to my dear

2818
02:04:44,665 --> 02:04:45,970
Yes, the deer wanted
to see her dear

2819
02:04:46,259 --> 02:04:48,705
What's with the songs
and devotional bhajans?

2820
02:04:49,361 --> 02:04:51,598
Don't invite crowd saying
it's a surprise party

2821
02:04:51,762 --> 02:04:54,442
This ain't a party conference
to play song and invite crowd

2822
02:04:54,559 --> 02:04:57,074
We've arranged an intimate
meeting for you both

2823
02:04:57,262 --> 02:04:58,817
The volume seems to increase

2824
02:04:58,817 --> 02:04:59,559
Well, sir...

2825
02:04:59,856 --> 02:05:02,207
she downloaded Purushothama
Paramananda videos from YouTube...

2826
02:05:02,277 --> 02:05:03,450
to pep herself up

2827
02:05:03,496 --> 02:05:04,348
Oh! Is it?

2828
02:05:04,348 --> 02:05:05,857
-It's all for you!
-Goose bumps!

2829
02:05:05,943 --> 02:05:08,036
Won't such a high volume
exhaust our mind?

2830
02:05:08,107 --> 02:05:09,490
How about I open a soda
and spray on your face?

2831
02:05:10,802 --> 02:05:12,122
Or shall I feed some
glucose solution?

2832
02:05:13,794 --> 02:05:16,529
Not enough! There
isn't enough fire!

2833
02:05:16,708 --> 02:05:20,275
Say whatever you want. I'm
not in vigorous Baasha mood now

2834
02:05:20,345 --> 02:05:21,900
I'm in calm Manickam mood

2835
02:05:22,064 --> 02:05:26,314
"He walks down like a
lion as he approaches me"

2836
02:05:26,407 --> 02:05:29,587
-Dear Manickam...
-Sing like this and your jaws will break!

2837
02:05:29,773 --> 02:05:32,304
Sir, now you must change to
devil Antony's mood!

2838
02:05:34,562 --> 02:05:35,367
You're kids

2839
02:05:35,547 --> 02:05:37,821
Leave. I'll take care from here.
Leave

2840
02:05:38,103 --> 02:05:38,603
Go

2841
02:05:38,728 --> 02:05:40,110
My dear Margadhavalli Manickam!

2842
02:05:42,431 --> 02:05:45,274
This case is closed!

2843
02:05:45,314 --> 02:05:47,954
God! They even got me
singing out of happiness!

2844
02:05:48,064 --> 02:05:50,892
"She's my angel who
came looking for me"

2845
02:05:51,070 --> 02:05:54,280
"Your beauty will give
beauty a run for it's money"

2846
02:05:54,391 --> 02:05:57,393
"Words aren't enough
to describe you"

2847
02:05:57,470 --> 02:06:00,158
"I want my angel!"

2848
02:06:00,564 --> 02:06:04,596
"My dear angel, the moment I saw
you, my heart skipped a beat"

2849
02:06:05,025 --> 02:06:07,228
My darling! Who! A new face!

2850
02:06:08,217 --> 02:06:09,108
Where am I?

2851
02:06:09,803 --> 02:06:12,358
Did they put me here so that I won't
get married and become a saint?

2852
02:06:12,412 --> 02:06:14,805
Om nama shivaya!
Om nama shivaya!

2853
02:06:16,089 --> 02:06:17,292
Where are you guys?

2854
02:06:17,448 --> 02:06:19,433
Did you drive me all
the way to Kailasam?

2855
02:06:26,971 --> 02:06:29,305
Who approved your license?
Where are you going?

2856
02:06:30,712 --> 02:06:33,718
Ready! One... two... three... Go!

2857
02:06:36,394 --> 02:06:37,418
-Dude!
-Leave it!

2858
02:06:37,488 --> 02:06:39,997
That 'Adyar Undertaker' tortured
me to the core. There are no shops

2859
02:06:39,997 --> 02:06:42,895
You better give it to me

2860
02:06:43,226 --> 02:06:46,140
That Adyar Undertaker and
you, both of you tortured me!

2861
02:06:46,304 --> 02:06:48,057
I'm five times more upset than you!

2862
02:06:48,291 --> 02:06:50,346
Let go of the bottle. You don't
deserve even a drop of beer

2863
02:06:50,478 --> 02:06:50,978
Leave it!

2864
02:06:50,979 --> 02:06:52,690
Remember he won't beat you
for what we did to him

2865
02:06:52,713 --> 02:06:54,542
But he'll definitely tie me
to a lamp post and hit me

2866
02:06:54,580 --> 02:06:56,806
Think of it and it sends a shudder
down my spine. Give this to me

2867
02:06:58,186 --> 02:06:59,190
Holy guacamole!

2868
02:06:59,682 --> 02:07:03,733
The mosaic head uncle of mine was
forcing me to marry his daughter

2869
02:07:03,835 --> 02:07:07,139
And my Malarvizhi was behind me
asking when will I marry her

2870
02:07:07,858 --> 02:07:09,983
Now both of them don't
even mind me these days

2871
02:07:10,069 --> 02:07:11,907
She doesn't even give
me a missed call

2872
02:07:11,956 --> 02:07:14,181
All these things are
bursting my head open!

2873
02:07:14,680 --> 02:07:15,180
Look!

2874
02:07:15,673 --> 02:07:18,853
You don't even deserve the
empty bottle! It's all for me

2875
02:07:21,006 --> 02:07:21,506
Fine, dude

2876
02:07:22,091 --> 02:07:23,732
You have issues and so do I

2877
02:07:24,146 --> 02:07:26,318
How about we share it 50-50?

2878
02:07:26,646 --> 02:07:28,100
50-50?

2879
02:07:30,071 --> 02:07:31,493
-50-50?
-Yeah

2880
02:07:33,499 --> 02:07:35,748
Travels owner is considering.
I hope he'll share the beer

2881
02:07:36,603 --> 02:07:37,678
Okay, I trust you

2882
02:07:38,001 --> 02:07:38,994
Before that...

2883
02:07:39,891 --> 02:07:41,010
I will ask you a question

2884
02:07:42,087 --> 02:07:43,985
-You must swear on this beer...
-I swear on it

2885
02:07:44,376 --> 02:07:45,298
I'm yet to ask the question

2886
02:07:46,204 --> 02:07:46,830
It's getting late

2887
02:07:47,735 --> 02:07:48,485
Fine...

2888
02:07:49,126 --> 02:07:51,826
after that Adyar Undertaker removes
the blindfold and gets upset...

2889
02:07:52,070 --> 02:07:54,305
and tells on you to his daughter...

2890
02:07:54,665 --> 02:07:56,634
and if she breaks up with you...

2891
02:07:57,478 --> 02:07:58,658
What will you do?

2892
02:07:58,977 --> 02:08:01,032
"I have to find a bride for
your dad at this age...."

2893
02:08:01,361 --> 02:08:02,533
"Then get him married..."

2894
02:08:02,652 --> 02:08:03,759
"Then send him to honeymoon..."

2895
02:08:03,868 --> 02:08:06,099
"I cannot do such
cringe works hereafter"

2896
02:08:06,481 --> 02:08:08,965
"Trust me and come with me and
I shall take good care of you"

2897
02:08:09,216 --> 02:08:10,521
"Or else let's break up right away"

2898
02:08:10,818 --> 02:08:11,703
That's what I'll tell her

2899
02:08:11,704 --> 02:08:13,719
I got! I got in voice recorder

2900
02:08:13,832 --> 02:08:15,775
It will work as evidence till court

2901
02:08:16,207 --> 02:08:17,342
Here, drink

2902
02:08:18,100 --> 02:08:18,600
Have fun

2903
02:08:20,108 --> 02:08:20,811
What about you?

2904
02:08:21,389 --> 02:08:22,491
I had one hidden with me

2905
02:08:23,495 --> 02:08:23,995
Whoa!

2906
02:08:24,249 --> 02:08:26,078
You hid the chalk
during kindergarten

2907
02:08:26,164 --> 02:08:27,640
Now you're hiding this crap

2908
02:08:27,954 --> 02:08:29,728
No comments. Cheers

2909
02:08:30,063 --> 02:08:31,087
Cheers

2910
02:08:31,156 --> 02:08:33,023
One second, dude.
I think mom's calling me

2911
02:08:34,175 --> 02:08:35,254
Dude, it's Thulasi

2912
02:08:35,316 --> 02:08:36,276
What do I tell her?

2913
02:08:36,324 --> 02:08:37,769
Break up with her and hang the call

2914
02:08:39,745 --> 02:08:40,950
Tell me

2915
02:08:41,235 --> 02:08:42,651
I must meet you at once.
Where are you?

2916
02:08:43,652 --> 02:08:45,800
On G N Chetty road bridge.
Come here if you wanna meet me

2917
02:08:47,254 --> 02:08:48,121
She hung up

2918
02:08:51,971 --> 02:08:54,104
Boys ditch a girl only
when they have a reason

2919
02:08:54,229 --> 02:08:56,573
But girls ditch boys
like seasons change

2920
02:08:56,690 --> 02:08:58,308
Dude, you are swag!

2921
02:08:58,651 --> 02:08:59,268
Cheers

2922
02:09:00,042 --> 02:09:01,310
Wait, let me get the side dish

2923
02:09:15,127 --> 02:09:18,342
"Cold nights..."

2924
02:09:18,615 --> 02:09:21,319
"Dreams in our hearts..."

2925
02:09:23,459 --> 02:09:24,319
Power outage?

2926
02:09:24,975 --> 02:09:28,349
Hi, Sundari akka! One
plate squid fry please

2927
02:09:29,248 --> 02:09:30,209
Dude, it's Thulasi

2928
02:09:30,857 --> 02:09:31,826
What have you done?

2929
02:09:31,935 --> 02:09:33,826
How do you get such ideas?
I don't believe it

2930
02:09:33,990 --> 02:09:36,071
Dude, I need to fill air in
the speaker. I'll be back

2931
02:09:36,848 --> 02:09:38,371
Stay right here!

2932
02:09:39,261 --> 02:09:41,980
You did such a huge deed and
you didn't even tell me about it

2933
02:09:42,394 --> 02:09:44,238
I didn't expect this from you

2934
02:09:44,324 --> 02:09:46,684
-I can sleep only if I hear music. I'll go there
-Stay here!

2935
02:09:47,043 --> 02:09:49,136
Once everything is over.
I'll sing you to sleep

2936
02:09:49,175 --> 02:09:50,488
Listen to music and
sleep; my foot!

2937
02:09:50,654 --> 02:09:51,154
Thulasi...

2938
02:09:51,754 --> 02:09:52,810
all I have to say is...

2939
02:09:52,810 --> 02:09:54,977
My dad asked me to
show you something

2940
02:09:55,055 --> 02:09:56,992
We both did it. Show him first

2941
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:58,320
I've nothing to do with this.
It's all him

2942
02:09:58,351 --> 02:10:00,203
I won't show him.
I'll only show to you

2943
02:10:00,249 --> 02:10:01,343
Dude, told you!

2944
02:10:01,384 --> 02:10:03,561
They'll leave you and torture me!

2945
02:10:03,651 --> 02:10:05,623
You do everything and
act like you're innocent!

2946
02:10:05,647 --> 02:10:07,121
Thulasi no!

2947
02:10:07,348 --> 02:10:08,715
I love you!

2948
02:10:09,553 --> 02:10:11,444
I don't know how to thank you

2949
02:10:11,499 --> 02:10:13,418
-Thank you!
-Thank you?

2950
02:10:13,623 --> 02:10:16,139
You haven't watched the video
yet, right? I'll show you

2951
02:10:17,139 --> 02:10:19,396
Greetings, dears! Aravind,
I'll show you something

2952
02:10:19,585 --> 02:10:22,757
My soul mate, my sweetheart
and my dream girl...

2953
02:10:25,751 --> 02:10:27,257
-A foreigner in Indian attire
-Whoa!

2954
02:10:27,430 --> 02:10:29,320
Clara from Germany

2955
02:10:29,336 --> 02:10:30,179
Look at that!

2956
02:10:31,437 --> 02:10:33,235
Me and Rams are made for each other

2957
02:10:33,585 --> 02:10:35,351
And we're going to live together

2958
02:10:35,461 --> 02:10:37,093
Bye!

2959
02:10:37,289 --> 02:10:38,546
-Come on, baby
-Yes, darling

2960
02:10:39,023 --> 02:10:41,486
Censor, darling. Bye!

2961
02:10:42,128 --> 02:10:45,449
Dude, our route is clear! Yay!

2962
02:10:46,261 --> 02:10:47,995
Malarvizhi is mine!

2963
02:10:49,066 --> 02:10:50,676
Yay!

2964
02:10:51,057 --> 02:10:54,103
Finally, Undertaker
found his Andrea

2965
02:10:54,253 --> 02:10:56,604
Aravind won back Thulasi

2966
02:10:56,808 --> 02:10:59,610
In order to discuss about
their farewell day oath...

2967
02:10:59,673 --> 02:11:02,962
Aravind and Saami asked Thulasi
to meet them at a coffee shop

2968
02:11:03,197 --> 02:11:04,993
As usual Thulasi was late

2969
02:11:05,290 --> 02:11:06,634
Girls never change you know?

2970
02:11:07,130 --> 02:11:08,622
Sorry, I am a bit late

2971
02:11:08,676 --> 02:11:10,286
-That's okay
-Have you been waiting for long?

2972
02:11:10,504 --> 02:11:12,539
No, just for an hour and half

2973
02:11:12,867 --> 02:11:14,852
-I'm just telling the truth
-Let me talk

2974
02:11:14,922 --> 02:11:17,846
Fine, tell me what is that you
wanted to discuss about marriage?

2975
02:11:18,173 --> 02:11:21,301
You know right that I and Saami
are best friends since childhood

2976
02:11:21,635 --> 02:11:23,455
We studied together
from Pre KG to college

2977
02:11:23,745 --> 02:11:24,924
I know it already

2978
02:11:25,252 --> 02:11:27,424
You'll be friends forever. So what?

2979
02:11:28,527 --> 02:11:29,909
Well, when it comes to wedding...

2980
02:11:29,959 --> 02:11:32,527
We decided that we'll marry on the
same day on the same dais...

2981
02:11:32,553 --> 02:11:35,206
and it was an oath we took
at our college farewell day

2982
02:11:35,748 --> 02:11:38,785
Guess what, after my college farewell
too, I planned with my friends...

2983
02:11:38,972 --> 02:11:40,769
to go on a Kulu-Manali trip

2984
02:11:41,097 --> 02:11:42,441
No idea where that gang is now

2985
02:11:42,636 --> 02:11:43,274
Look here

2986
02:11:43,535 --> 02:11:45,074
I don't know about
girls' friendship

2987
02:11:45,285 --> 02:11:47,083
But if boy makes a decision...

2988
02:11:47,294 --> 02:11:49,184
then we'll definitely try
our best to live up to it

2989
02:11:49,473 --> 02:11:52,247
Now what's that his highness
want to live up to?

2990
02:11:52,325 --> 02:11:53,309
Can you tell me clearly?

2991
02:11:53,739 --> 02:11:55,818
Saami postponed his wedding
for six months, for my sake

2992
02:11:55,921 --> 02:11:58,185
Dude, that six months
got over two months ago

2993
02:11:58,285 --> 02:11:59,427
This is the eight month!

2994
02:11:59,662 --> 02:12:00,342
Please, dude!

2995
02:12:01,029 --> 02:12:03,670
The day we get married, on the
same day and in the same dais...

2996
02:12:03,998 --> 02:12:06,351
Saami and his uncle's daughter,
Malarvizhi should also get married

2997
02:12:07,554 --> 02:12:08,804
Careful, dear

2998
02:12:09,897 --> 02:12:10,947
Here, sister. Tissue paper

2999
02:12:11,507 --> 02:12:12,007
Thank you

3000
02:12:14,266 --> 02:12:15,956
Saami, please move

3001
02:12:17,302 --> 02:12:18,397
Did you just throw it on my face?

3002
02:12:18,703 --> 02:12:19,203
Aravind...

3003
02:12:19,688 --> 02:12:20,875
whatever you said...

3004
02:12:21,485 --> 02:12:24,502
might be emotional for you
but sounds funny to me

3005
02:12:24,555 --> 02:12:25,172
Come again!

3006
02:12:25,487 --> 02:12:27,917
Funny? Do you think Adithya
channel show is running here?

3007
02:12:28,002 --> 02:12:30,448
-You say it's funny!
-I am telling you something very serious

3008
02:12:30,557 --> 02:12:32,163
And you're hurting
me saying it's funny

3009
02:12:33,209 --> 02:12:36,318
Sorry, I didn't say that to hurt
you but I was being practical

3010
02:12:36,928 --> 02:12:39,328
Getting married on the same
day and on the same dais...

3011
02:12:39,935 --> 02:12:40,732
No chance!

3012
02:12:41,091 --> 02:12:43,334
To be frank, not even a percent

3013
02:12:44,170 --> 02:12:47,448
Thulasi, you decide every
other aspect of our wedding

3014
02:12:47,611 --> 02:12:48,971
I won't interfere in anything

3015
02:12:49,237 --> 02:12:50,830
This is the only request
I've from my side

3016
02:12:50,939 --> 02:12:52,354
Please consider it, dear

3017
02:12:53,470 --> 02:12:54,112
See Aravind...

3018
02:12:54,337 --> 02:12:58,416
my dad would like to conduct my marriage
in a grand manner, in a star hotel

3019
02:12:58,533 --> 02:13:01,354
Like we'll conduct it in a warehouse!
We'll also conduct it in a hall

3020
02:13:02,713 --> 02:13:04,869
My wedding will have
a buffet food system

3021
02:13:05,104 --> 02:13:06,674
We'll have a system where food
is served in plantain leaf

3022
02:13:06,791 --> 02:13:08,886
And finishing touch, we'll
have dessert with poppadums

3023
02:13:10,167 --> 02:13:14,104
Everyone will dress up and look
cute in Sherwani and Lehenga

3024
02:13:14,237 --> 02:13:16,924
We'll take bath and show
up in dhoti and shirt

3025
02:13:17,963 --> 02:13:22,032
There will be pre wedding and post
wedding photo shoots in my wedding

3026
02:13:22,447 --> 02:13:23,330
Ever heard of it?

3027
02:13:23,994 --> 02:13:25,017
Photo shoot it seems. Dude!

3028
02:13:25,205 --> 02:13:26,843
If we arrange our Sudha
video coverage...

3029
02:13:26,907 --> 02:13:29,328
they will give a CD full of
photo and a CD full of video

3030
02:13:29,405 --> 02:13:30,421
That too in no time

3031
02:13:30,508 --> 02:13:32,531
Now, they are advanced and
will give us all that in a pen drive

3032
02:13:32,679 --> 02:13:34,008
Most important thing...

3033
02:13:34,179 --> 02:13:37,779
everyone will wear make up and
look decent in my wedding

3034
02:13:38,271 --> 02:13:40,373
But, how about in his family?

3035
02:13:41,287 --> 02:13:43,076
They don't bath and wear make
up and she boasts about it!

3036
02:13:43,224 --> 02:13:43,724
Fine!

3037
02:13:43,927 --> 02:13:45,717
If all these take place in
the same marriage hall...

3038
02:13:45,795 --> 02:13:48,982
imagine how our wedding photos
and videos will turn out?

3039
02:13:49,502 --> 02:13:51,372
After a decade, when our
kids will ask us...

3040
02:13:51,407 --> 02:13:54,112
"Why is your wedding
album so pathetic?"

3041
02:13:54,184 --> 02:13:55,776
What reply will I give them?

3042
02:13:55,948 --> 02:13:57,807
Forget what your kid
will ask after a decade

3043
02:13:57,924 --> 02:13:59,924
First, answer my question properly

3044
02:14:00,176 --> 02:14:02,465
We are planning to get married on
the same day and on the same dais

3045
02:14:02,504 --> 02:14:03,947
Are you okay with it or not?

3046
02:14:04,238 --> 02:14:05,417
Nicely put, dude!

3047
02:14:05,621 --> 02:14:06,402
Fine, wait

3048
02:14:06,598 --> 02:14:07,488
Let's do one thing

3049
02:14:07,683 --> 02:14:09,753
Ask your friend to get
married on the previous day

3050
02:14:09,910 --> 02:14:11,589
Or ask him to get
married the next day

3051
02:14:12,542 --> 02:14:14,729
I'll take care of his marriage
expense too. Poor guy

3052
02:14:14,735 --> 02:14:15,423
How dare you?

3053
02:14:15,634 --> 02:14:18,510
But to get married on the same
day and on the same dais...

3054
02:14:18,909 --> 02:14:19,730
No chance!

3055
02:14:20,249 --> 02:14:21,405
Is that your final decision?

3056
02:14:22,108 --> 02:14:22,757
Obviously

3057
02:14:23,015 --> 02:14:26,547
Which girl would want to share the
same dais on her wedding day?

3058
02:14:26,672 --> 02:14:29,845
Before I say something abusive,
you better leave. Take a hike!

3059
02:14:30,101 --> 02:14:31,414
Hello! What do you mean?

3060
02:14:31,438 --> 02:14:34,289
Stop showing off
with your accent!

3061
02:14:34,417 --> 02:14:36,228
People wearing Sherwani
and Lehenga are posh...

3062
02:14:36,250 --> 02:14:37,859
but those like us who wear
dhoti and shirt are local?

3063
02:14:37,938 --> 02:14:39,282
Why are you yelling in public?

3064
02:14:39,415 --> 02:14:41,134
-Calm down, dude
-Shut up!

3065
02:14:41,188 --> 02:14:43,103
Those who eat buffer are decent...

3066
02:14:43,437 --> 02:14:45,110
but those who eat meals in
plantain leaves are indecent?

3067
02:14:45,181 --> 02:14:48,119
Dude, she is the one you're
going to marry. Quiet!

3068
02:14:48,462 --> 02:14:49,227
Leave me, dude

3069
02:14:49,376 --> 02:14:51,024
You all are fair skinned...

3070
02:14:51,104 --> 02:14:53,706
hence make up and applying scent without
bathing makes you high class...

3071
02:14:53,736 --> 02:14:56,096
but those, like us, who bath daily
and apply holy ash are low class?

3072
02:14:56,150 --> 02:14:58,514
"A rumour was sparked up that dark
skinned people are low class"

3073
02:14:58,541 --> 02:15:00,520
"Put an end to that
rumours, damn it!"

3074
02:15:00,791 --> 02:15:02,700
Why are you talking
politics unnecessarily?

3075
02:15:02,879 --> 02:15:06,083
Dude, I'll get married to
Malarvizhi in some temple

3076
02:15:06,200 --> 02:15:08,825
You get married to her in a
start hotel, as per her wish

3077
02:15:08,945 --> 02:15:10,567
-I'm leaving
-Stop! I'm fighting also for you here

3078
02:15:11,785 --> 02:15:14,777
The moment you used your status
to discriminate my friend...

3079
02:15:15,042 --> 02:15:17,642
I feel that in future you'll do
the same to me and my mother

3080
02:15:17,730 --> 02:15:18,753
I have had enough!

3081
02:15:18,901 --> 02:15:21,933
Hereafter no matter how much we try,
our relationship just won't work out

3082
02:15:21,979 --> 02:15:22,479
Break up!

3083
02:15:24,346 --> 02:15:26,354
Why are you quiet?

3084
02:15:26,448 --> 02:15:27,924
-Talk!
-Like you allowed me to

3085
02:15:28,112 --> 02:15:30,263
-Did you allow me?
-Talk

3086
02:15:32,716 --> 02:15:33,216
Sister...

3087
02:15:34,018 --> 02:15:36,716
In future you'd marry
someone and have a kid

3088
02:15:36,841 --> 02:15:39,755
And when the cylinder
guy,newspaper guy...

3089
02:15:39,804 --> 02:15:41,734
milk vendor, water can delivery
guy comes to your home...

3090
02:15:41,919 --> 02:15:44,029
that kid of yours can address
all of them as uncle

3091
02:15:44,396 --> 02:15:47,045
But only your husband's
friend will be...

3092
02:15:47,273 --> 02:15:49,382
that kid's real uncle!

3093
02:15:49,616 --> 02:15:50,421
You know why?

3094
02:15:51,577 --> 02:15:52,822
Because I'm like a brother to you

3095
02:15:53,420 --> 02:15:54,616
That's our relationship

3096
02:15:55,124 --> 02:15:56,339
But now I tell you this!

3097
02:15:56,470 --> 02:15:58,736
If you marry and have a kid...

3098
02:15:58,791 --> 02:16:02,495
that kid will yearn for an
uncle and go into depression!

3099
02:16:02,886 --> 02:16:04,237
This is not a statement!

3100
02:16:04,774 --> 02:16:07,725
My curse! My curse! My curse!

3101
02:16:07,755 --> 02:16:08,255
Dude!

3102
02:16:08,272 --> 02:16:09,709
-Awesome!
-My curse

3103
02:16:10,362 --> 02:16:12,951
The first thing you did
was attack my friendship

3104
02:16:13,112 --> 02:16:15,948
This case is closed.
Tatah, bye-bye!

3105
02:16:16,307 --> 02:16:19,294
So, tatah, bye-bye

3106
02:16:19,373 --> 02:16:22,632
So, tatah, bye-bye

3107
02:16:38,354 --> 02:16:41,229
"My love is a topless tuk-tuk"

3108
02:16:41,838 --> 02:16:45,694
"My heart is like a
beer without it's jizz"

3109
02:16:45,729 --> 02:16:48,893
"My love is a topless tuk-tuk"

3110
02:16:48,979 --> 02:16:52,752
"My heart is like a
beer without it's jizz"

3111
02:16:52,792 --> 02:16:56,026
"The first thing you did
was attack my friendship"

3112
02:16:56,081 --> 02:16:59,455
"I don't need you hereafter.
So, tatah, bye-bye"

3113
02:16:59,940 --> 02:17:03,002
"The first thing you did
was attack my friendship"

3114
02:17:03,223 --> 02:17:06,731
"I don't need you hereafter.
So, tatah, bye-bye"

3115
02:17:06,769 --> 02:17:10,278
"So, tatah, bye-bye"

3116
02:17:10,324 --> 02:17:13,503
"So, tatah, bye-bye"

3117
02:17:13,847 --> 02:17:20,806
"So, tatah, bye-bye"

3118
02:17:44,594 --> 02:17:48,186
"You just ditched me without a
word, where are your manners?"

3119
02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:51,787
"And every status you put
is a taking a dig at me"

3120
02:17:51,834 --> 02:17:55,080
"I failed in love because
of which I became famous"

3121
02:17:55,330 --> 02:17:58,572
"You stabbed me in the back.
You too Brutus?"

3122
02:17:58,838 --> 02:18:02,334
"I went in search of
love and found one"

3123
02:18:02,436 --> 02:18:05,883
"I was true but I all got
in return was betrayal"

3124
02:18:06,014 --> 02:18:09,467
"Now our wedding remains a dream"

3125
02:18:09,529 --> 02:18:12,869
"Love must not be forced
otherwise it's a waste"

3126
02:18:12,900 --> 02:18:16,072
"We had fun and sang duets"

3127
02:18:16,299 --> 02:18:19,244
"To win in life you must be alone"

3128
02:18:19,987 --> 02:18:21,416
"That is life, buddy"

3129
02:18:22,914 --> 02:18:26,626
"So, tatah, bye-bye"

3130
02:18:26,772 --> 02:18:30,256
"So, tatah, bye-bye"

3131
02:18:30,342 --> 02:18:33,612
"So, tatah, bye-bye"

3132
02:18:33,823 --> 02:18:37,635
"So, tatah, bye-bye"

3133
02:19:06,458 --> 02:19:09,843
"Don't show off your wheeling skills
after the girl falls for you"

3134
02:19:09,952 --> 02:19:13,445
"Because if you fall then you
can't even ride a cycle"

3135
02:19:13,554 --> 02:19:16,842
"Don't gift you heart
just like that"

3136
02:19:17,100 --> 02:19:20,397
"Never give up on your friend"

3137
02:19:20,585 --> 02:19:24,147
"Grow a tree and it'll
give you shade"

3138
02:19:24,264 --> 02:19:27,621
"But grow your love and
it'll yield nothing"

3139
02:19:27,761 --> 02:19:31,231
"Cursing is a waste of time"

3140
02:19:31,317 --> 02:19:34,435
"Just wish her the
best and move on"

3141
02:19:34,575 --> 02:19:37,904
"Love has made me blind"

3142
02:19:38,029 --> 02:19:41,623
"Be complacent and
it hits on my head"

3143
02:19:43,414 --> 02:19:44,906
"This case is closed"

3144
02:19:44,993 --> 02:19:48,961
"My love! My love! My love..."

3145
02:19:49,078 --> 02:19:51,493
"My love is a topless tuk-tuk"

3146
02:19:52,086 --> 02:19:55,820
"My heart is like a
beer without it's jizz"

3147
02:19:55,883 --> 02:19:59,122
"My love is a topless tuk-tuk"

3148
02:19:59,209 --> 02:20:03,029
"My heart is like a
beer without it's jizz"

3149
02:20:03,209 --> 02:20:06,343
"The first thing you did
was attack my friendship"

3150
02:20:06,366 --> 02:20:09,601
"I don't need you hereafter.
So, tatah, bye-bye"

3151
02:20:10,036 --> 02:20:13,421
"So, tatah, bye-bye"

3152
02:20:13,474 --> 02:20:16,599
"So, tatah, bye-bye"

3153
02:20:16,942 --> 02:20:20,457
"So, tatah, bye-bye"

3154
02:20:20,503 --> 02:20:24,684
"So, tatah, bye-bye"

3155
02:20:27,619 --> 02:20:29,612
Pasupathy, stop the vehicle!

3156
02:20:32,548 --> 02:20:35,016
Someone who doesn't know the value
of booze has left it on the road

3157
02:20:46,935 --> 02:20:49,719
"No matter what happens,
I'll always be happy"

3158
02:20:49,961 --> 02:20:53,667
"Rakita! Rakita! Rakita!"

3159
02:20:53,969 --> 02:20:59,168
"You're caught! You're caught!
You're caught!"

3160
02:20:59,222 --> 02:21:00,480
Why didn't you attend
my break up party?

3161
02:21:00,527 --> 02:21:03,153
Like your break up party had Deepika
Padukone as the chief guest!

3162
02:21:03,215 --> 02:21:05,332
You must have danced with
Dinesh master's dancers

3163
02:21:05,590 --> 02:21:08,067
How can you talk like I'm
a third person to you?"

3164
02:21:08,145 --> 02:21:10,051
-Is that all our friendship worth?
-Yes, indeed!

3165
02:21:10,559 --> 02:21:12,012
I'm gonna stop listening to you...

3166
02:21:12,184 --> 02:21:13,918
and start listening to my
girlfriend, Malarvizhi

3167
02:21:14,559 --> 02:21:15,059
Yes!

3168
02:21:15,504 --> 02:21:17,981
Yes! I'm still in a
relationship with Malarvizhi

3169
02:21:19,512 --> 02:21:21,457
Remember what she told me the
day we sat and drank toddy?

3170
02:21:21,528 --> 02:21:23,151
-I don't even remember her
-You forgot her?

3171
02:21:23,651 --> 02:21:25,330
Look there and you'll recollect

3172
02:21:26,252 --> 02:21:28,971
-Cut his friendship
-I don't know him. Get lost!

3173
02:21:30,081 --> 02:21:30,581
Yes

3174
02:21:30,729 --> 02:21:31,724
So what?

3175
02:21:31,940 --> 02:21:32,440
So...

3176
02:21:32,737 --> 02:21:34,604
I know after everything,
for a final touch...

3177
02:21:34,658 --> 02:21:38,315
you will cross this place
in search of a beer

3178
02:21:38,580 --> 02:21:40,486
I used this beer
bottle and trapped you

3179
02:21:40,676 --> 02:21:43,146
Don't boast like you trapped
a tiger in Amazon forest

3180
02:21:43,224 --> 02:21:44,599
Now spit it out!

3181
02:21:44,911 --> 02:21:49,717
Well, buddy. I'm planning to marry
Malarvizhi at a temple, in a simple manner

3182
02:21:49,907 --> 02:21:52,509
Then start a business in the
name "Puniyam Real estate"

3183
02:21:52,667 --> 02:21:58,415
The roam around in a Red scorpio car as
the Ammanabakkam councilor's son-in-law

3184
02:21:58,493 --> 02:21:59,485
That's what I've decided

3185
02:21:59,540 --> 02:22:03,446
So that's why I stopped you
to find out what's your plan

3186
02:22:03,571 --> 02:22:05,431
Buddy, give me two minutes

3187
02:22:05,540 --> 02:22:08,750
All my kick has gone down. I
shall have this and tell you

3188
02:22:11,969 --> 02:22:13,112
What the hell is this?

3189
02:22:13,139 --> 02:22:15,993
I just filled an empty bottle with
well water and you drank it. Why?

3190
02:22:17,033 --> 02:22:18,150
Yes, well water

3191
02:22:21,314 --> 02:22:21,858
Buddy...

3192
02:22:22,298 --> 02:22:24,046
The way I broke this bottle...

3193
02:22:24,165 --> 02:22:26,462
is how I have crushed my love too

3194
02:22:26,516 --> 02:22:28,102
Hereafter even if I
visit Perumal temple...

3195
02:22:28,103 --> 02:22:29,993
I'll accept only offering
without thulasi (herbs)

3196
02:22:30,017 --> 02:22:30,765
Stop! Stop!

3197
02:22:30,892 --> 02:22:32,681
I'm confused. Give me the statement

3198
02:22:32,908 --> 02:22:33,681
Dude...

3199
02:22:34,158 --> 02:22:37,415
I've decided to marry your uncle's
second daughter, Sudarvizhi

3200
02:22:37,461 --> 02:22:39,002
She's not Sudarvizhi but Kayalvizhi

3201
02:22:39,040 --> 02:22:40,392
Whatever dude!

3202
02:22:40,484 --> 02:22:42,266
But you're my only hope, dude

3203
02:22:42,634 --> 02:22:46,068
I'll also marry your uncle's daughter
in a simple manner in a temple

3204
02:22:46,175 --> 02:22:49,183
I'll become one of the partners for
your uncle's real estate business

3205
02:22:49,393 --> 02:22:53,007
I'll become councilor's younger son-in-law
and settle down in Ammanambakkam

3206
02:22:53,417 --> 02:22:56,781
Will you give me a seat
in your Red scorpio car?

3207
02:23:00,121 --> 02:23:03,480
I advised this earlier but
you're going to do the same now

3208
02:23:03,699 --> 02:23:06,535
Some people learn
only when they suffer

3209
02:23:06,810 --> 02:23:09,746
-Buddy, you are...
-I know, I am swag!

3210
02:23:10,590 --> 02:23:12,166
You are awesome, dude!

3211
02:23:18,797 --> 02:23:21,256
Thank God, all the
bad omen are gone.

3212
02:23:21,337 --> 02:23:22,337
Aunt...

3213
02:23:22,509 --> 02:23:23,876
My dear aunt.

3214
02:23:24,822 --> 02:23:26,799
The arrangements and
the welcome set up...

3215
02:23:26,886 --> 02:23:27,886
What's the occasion?

3216
02:23:28,229 --> 02:23:29,229
Son-in...

3217
02:23:29,655 --> 02:23:31,390
Everyone's very quiet.

3218
02:23:31,515 --> 02:23:33,008
And you too are stuttering.

3219
02:23:33,250 --> 02:23:35,367
Then this function
is for you, right?

3220
02:23:35,711 --> 02:23:36,422
Son-in...

3221
02:23:36,609 --> 02:23:38,904
"Don't drag 'Son-in... Son-in..."

3222
02:23:39,086 --> 02:23:41,209
Call me Son-in-law
whole heartedly.

3223
02:23:41,365 --> 02:23:42,701
Son-in-law!

3224
02:23:43,732 --> 02:23:46,662
Dude why did your aunt
run away on seeing you?

3225
02:23:46,918 --> 02:23:49,317
- Is she scared?
- That's not fear but shyness.

3226
02:23:49,920 --> 02:23:52,205
You're city brought up and
so you won't understand.

3227
02:23:52,362 --> 02:23:54,674
In city even the bride
won't blush or feel shy.

3228
02:23:54,807 --> 02:23:57,346
But in village even the bride's
mom will blush and feel shy.

3229
02:23:57,372 --> 02:23:58,372
Here's the proof.

3230
02:23:58,963 --> 02:24:01,431
The is the secret success
of Bharathiraja, you know?

3231
02:24:02,923 --> 02:24:05,126
My dear Punniyakotti uncle!
Punniyakotti!

3232
02:24:05,361 --> 02:24:08,142
- I'm here for you. Come on, dude.
- Coming.

3233
02:24:19,235 --> 02:24:19,735
What's all this?

3234
02:24:20,133 --> 02:24:22,727
Did Malarvizhi come off age?

3235
02:24:25,344 --> 02:24:26,344
I got it.

3236
02:24:26,711 --> 02:24:28,695
Pre wedding photo shoot, right?

3237
02:24:33,975 --> 02:24:37,404
Bab... Bab... Baby shower?

3238
02:24:39,293 --> 02:24:42,727
Didn't you say that your maternal
uncle won't cross a line with you?

3239
02:24:42,933 --> 02:24:46,651
He crossed the line, went an extra step
ahead and got his daughter married,

3240
02:24:46,675 --> 02:24:48,395
and now they're celebrating
her baby shower!

3241
02:24:49,307 --> 02:24:51,302
Is this all the love
your uncle has for you?

3242
02:24:51,912 --> 02:24:53,881
Answer me! Answer me!

3243
02:24:57,606 --> 02:24:58,786
Uncle!

3244
02:24:59,685 --> 02:25:00,732
Come here.

3245
02:25:05,591 --> 02:25:07,247
How could you do this to me?

3246
02:25:09,026 --> 02:25:11,925
Look what you did in a
gap of eight months?

3247
02:25:12,456 --> 02:25:14,940
Punniyakotti betrayed you
instead of blessing you!

3248
02:25:15,253 --> 02:25:18,104
I am hurt. How are you
able to bear the pain?

3249
02:25:22,221 --> 02:25:23,378
Buddy

3250
02:25:28,731 --> 02:25:29,731
look at him!

3251
02:25:30,323 --> 02:25:33,433
Dear, please forgive me!
Please forgive me.

3252
02:25:34,394 --> 02:25:38,201
Or else I'll die right by your feet.

3253
02:25:38,604 --> 02:25:41,764
Are you trying to justify
what you did to him?

3254
02:25:43,446 --> 02:25:44,992
- Punniyakotti!
- Yes?

3255
02:25:45,063 --> 02:25:48,631
During my childhood, you obeyed
everything I ordered you.

3256
02:25:49,085 --> 02:25:53,085
I never even dreamt that
you'd betray me like this.

3257
02:25:53,592 --> 02:25:54,959
Why did you do this to me?

3258
02:25:55,561 --> 02:25:57,801
Answer me! Why did you do
this to me? Answer me!

3259
02:25:57,855 --> 02:25:59,229
Why did you do
this to me? Answer me!

3260
02:25:59,253 --> 02:26:00,941
What do you want me to tell you?

3261
02:26:01,129 --> 02:26:02,729
Tell me, what do you
want me to tell you?

3262
02:26:05,248 --> 02:26:07,881
You drank the toddy and dry
fish gravy I bought you,

3263
02:26:07,998 --> 02:26:11,123
yet you listened to this navy guy and
called off wedding with my daughter.

3264
02:26:11,243 --> 02:26:12,248
Should I tell you that?

3265
02:26:13,610 --> 02:26:15,181
Or instead of marrying
my daughter

3266
02:26:15,211 --> 02:26:18,946
you went to find him a bride and his
father-in-law a bride, forgetting me.

3267
02:26:19,008 --> 02:26:20,102
Should I tell you that?

3268
02:26:21,164 --> 02:26:23,843
Forget few people in the
village talking ill of me.

3269
02:26:23,882 --> 02:26:25,795
Thousands of them will
talk ill of me,

3270
02:26:25,819 --> 02:26:29,007
and it will affect my councilor
position votes in the future elections.

3271
02:26:29,038 --> 02:26:30,280
Should I tell you that?

3272
02:26:30,921 --> 02:26:34,613
As the village councilor I can
control the water flow here,

3273
02:26:35,321 --> 02:26:37,354
but can I control
people from gossiping?

3274
02:26:38,488 --> 02:26:40,441
This is what great
Avvaiyar said long ago...

3275
02:26:40,840 --> 02:26:44,050
- "The hand that shuts the mouth of the world..."
- Shut up.

3276
02:26:44,605 --> 02:26:46,011
Avvaiyar?

3277
02:26:46,745 --> 02:26:48,448
God! My head is bursting!

3278
02:26:48,510 --> 02:26:49,510
Leave it.

3279
02:26:50,159 --> 02:26:51,159
Fine.

3280
02:26:51,307 --> 02:26:51,807
Now what?

3281
02:26:52,253 --> 02:26:54,706
"Come on, dear! Come on, dear."

3282
02:26:54,932 --> 02:26:58,752
Do you want me to sing a love failure
song and bless you all and leave?

3283
02:26:58,776 --> 02:26:59,776
Dear!

3284
02:27:02,713 --> 02:27:05,273
Even if I live for five minutes,
I'll live with pride and valour.

3285
02:27:06,596 --> 02:27:07,744
Yeah, we saw it now!

3286
02:27:09,048 --> 02:27:11,072
I won't let you go empty handed.

3287
02:27:11,166 --> 02:27:13,545
Will you send him off with left
over food from the nearby temple?

3288
02:27:13,569 --> 02:27:15,937
Dude, stop it and shut up!

3289
02:27:17,086 --> 02:27:18,086
Kanniamma

3290
02:27:18,359 --> 02:27:19,859
what are you doing there?

3291
02:27:20,031 --> 02:27:22,031
Bring the couple along
with send off gift.

3292
02:27:22,088 --> 02:27:23,088
Coming.

3293
02:27:23,726 --> 02:27:24,867
Don't act!

3294
02:27:27,101 --> 02:27:28,101
Come.

3295
02:27:28,171 --> 02:27:29,468
My dear Malar.

3296
02:27:30,999 --> 02:27:31,999
Dear...

3297
02:27:32,219 --> 02:27:35,422
Say something sweet
and send him off.

3298
02:27:35,929 --> 02:27:39,281
For long I wanted to have
your initials for my kid.

3299
02:27:39,321 --> 02:27:40,778
- Yes...
- But

3300
02:27:40,887 --> 02:27:44,169
now I'll have to name my kid
after you as my lost love.

3301
02:27:44,208 --> 02:27:46,088
- Everything is over.
- It's all because of you!

3302
02:27:46,429 --> 02:27:47,148
Dear...

3303
02:27:47,327 --> 02:27:49,576
Call me that once again and
I'll pull out your heart!

3304
02:27:51,062 --> 02:27:52,062
What?

3305
02:27:52,218 --> 02:27:55,601
Hereafter you're like a son to me. You
must do my final rites when I die.

3306
02:27:55,851 --> 02:27:56,851
Come here.

3307
02:27:57,063 --> 02:27:58,968
Give me that match box, I'll
do his final rites at once!

3308
02:27:58,992 --> 02:28:00,695
Don't waste the match box on him.

3309
02:28:00,742 --> 02:28:03,141
Poor family. She's pregnant now.
Bless them.

3310
02:28:03,313 --> 02:28:05,428
Brother, please bless us quickly

3311
02:28:05,489 --> 02:28:06,919
I'm hungry.

3312
02:28:06,959 --> 02:28:08,879
A few minutes late and the
dessert will get over.

3313
02:28:09,076 --> 02:28:12,437
Your uncle got her married
to a dessert loving kid!

3314
02:28:12,498 --> 02:28:15,475
- Dude, I can't stand them anymore! Let's go!
- Let's go!

3315
02:28:15,513 --> 02:28:16,552
The send off gifts.

3316
02:28:16,888 --> 02:28:18,060
Okay, auntie -Take it.

3317
02:28:19,091 --> 02:28:20,653
The coconut in it will be
useful to make chutney.

3318
02:28:20,677 --> 02:28:22,747
It's a sin -Let's move on!

3319
02:28:25,684 --> 02:28:31,450
"Everything I think is
real turns out to be fake."

3320
02:28:31,591 --> 02:28:36,911
"Everything path that I take
turns out to be wrong one."

3321
02:28:37,474 --> 02:28:40,270
"Is the love real or fake..."

3322
02:28:40,402 --> 02:28:43,177
"I can only blame it on time."

3323
02:28:43,387 --> 02:28:46,262
"Is the love real or fake..."

3324
02:28:46,363 --> 02:28:48,717
"I can only blame it on time."

3325
02:28:49,349 --> 02:28:54,787
"A soul that came in
search of a home..."

3326
02:28:55,185 --> 02:29:00,248
"But is now wandering around in
the forest. Whom can we blame?"

3327
02:29:00,638 --> 02:29:01,638
Dude...

3328
02:29:01,848 --> 02:29:03,473
I was five years old when...

3329
02:29:03,739 --> 02:29:07,184
I was playing cricket and
hit the ball into the pond.

3330
02:29:07,785 --> 02:29:10,316
It was deep pond. Though
he didn't know to swim,

3331
02:29:10,612 --> 02:29:12,387
- yet my uncle dived into it and...
- Buddy

3332
02:29:12,543 --> 02:29:15,131
don't mind me interrupting.
An important matter.

3333
02:29:15,686 --> 02:29:17,327
Everything's over. You tell me.

3334
02:29:17,677 --> 02:29:18,771
Well, whatever
happened has happened.

3335
02:29:18,795 --> 02:29:21,772
Shall I marry your uncle's younger
daughter, Kayalvizhi and settle down?

3336
02:29:22,139 --> 02:29:23,510
At least let my life be good.

3337
02:29:23,955 --> 02:29:24,955
Come again?

3338
02:29:25,601 --> 02:29:28,267
My own maternal uncle is not
going to be my father-in-law,

3339
02:29:28,463 --> 02:29:30,002
but a stranger like you

3340
02:29:30,159 --> 02:29:34,204
want to marry his daughter and live
happily in this 'Puniya vilas'?

3341
02:29:34,312 --> 02:29:35,429
And I should watch it quietly?

3342
02:29:35,453 --> 02:29:37,472
- Forget our friendship. You leave.
- Listen to me.

3343
02:29:37,496 --> 02:29:39,050
Swami, what a surprise.

3344
02:29:39,125 --> 02:29:40,461
Why are you sitting down?

3345
02:29:40,571 --> 02:29:43,218
How are you? When did you come?
Did you eat?

3346
02:29:43,430 --> 02:29:46,310
Why did you come with a rented bike
driver for your sister's baby shower?

3347
02:29:46,498 --> 02:29:47,954
He's not my rented bike driver.

3348
02:29:48,071 --> 02:29:49,025
He's my husband!

3349
02:29:49,087 --> 02:29:50,884
We just got married a week ago.

3350
02:29:51,900 --> 02:29:53,080
What does he do?

3351
02:29:53,228 --> 02:29:54,689
He does real estate business.

3352
02:29:55,339 --> 02:29:56,699
Tell him -Give me the card.

3353
02:29:56,918 --> 02:29:57,980
Hello, I'm Thirumaran

3354
02:29:58,120 --> 02:30:01,581
I run Puniyam Real estate business.
Call me to buy or sell houses.

3355
02:30:01,769 --> 02:30:02,269
You too.

3356
02:30:02,324 --> 02:30:04,628
You've registered my business.
Fine! Don't show off!

3357
02:30:04,660 --> 02:30:05,353
Let's go!

3358
02:30:05,377 --> 02:30:07,494
Go. Go before she
delivers the baby!

3359
02:30:07,528 --> 02:30:08,482
Do eat and go.

3360
02:30:08,506 --> 02:30:09,200
What's going on?

3361
02:30:09,242 --> 02:30:10,903
He promised you his elder
daughter and betrayed you.

3362
02:30:10,927 --> 02:30:12,500
Promised me his younger
daughter and betrayed me!

3363
02:30:12,524 --> 02:30:13,998
He is big time cheater!

3364
02:30:14,115 --> 02:30:15,635
We must not spare him so easy!
Come on!

3365
02:30:16,365 --> 02:30:17,873
Come here. Come here.

3366
02:30:18,208 --> 02:30:20,358
Is he your or my maternal uncle?

3367
02:30:20,444 --> 02:30:20,943
Come again?

3368
02:30:20,967 --> 02:30:23,389
You're getting upset as if
he's your maternal uncle?

3369
02:30:23,608 --> 02:30:25,936
My life is ruined because of you!

3370
02:30:26,069 --> 02:30:27,811
To hell with your
friendship hereafter.

3371
02:30:28,358 --> 02:30:29,897
Hello! Excuse me -What?

3372
02:30:30,014 --> 02:30:33,030
You don't care about your best
friend's marriage! You're a sadist!

3373
02:30:33,092 --> 02:30:35,780
My marriage was about to happen and you
ruined it. What does that make you?

3374
02:30:35,804 --> 02:30:36,384
A scientist?

3375
02:30:36,462 --> 02:30:37,079
Dude!

3376
02:30:37,213 --> 02:30:39,949
Did you forget that I broke up
with my girlfriend for you?

3377
02:30:40,035 --> 02:30:42,059
Holy guacamole! I lost
everything for you,

3378
02:30:42,145 --> 02:30:43,910
and I'm left stranded
on the streets!

3379
02:30:44,690 --> 02:30:46,972
I don't want to see your
face even in Facebook.

3380
02:30:47,730 --> 02:30:50,135
I live without you in the sea. I can
live without you in the land too!

3381
02:30:50,159 --> 02:30:51,966
I shouldn't hear your voice in
Whatsapp voice message!

3382
02:30:51,990 --> 02:30:53,710
Don't send even a message
or I'll abuse you!

3383
02:30:53,809 --> 02:30:54,981
This is our last meet!

3384
02:30:55,073 --> 02:30:56,988
- Get lost!
- You too! Get lost!

3385
02:31:13,456 --> 02:31:15,789
Accepting the fact that "Follows
Gods path and you shall receive joy"

3386
02:31:15,813 --> 02:31:21,120
and heading to Kasi is our
worry free Saaminathan.

3387
02:31:21,510 --> 02:31:25,486
But he didn't receive any joy instead
he received a message from Aravind.

3388
02:31:26,408 --> 02:31:27,408
Saaminatha!

3389
02:31:28,393 --> 02:31:29,673
Your phone's ringing. Attend it.

3390
02:31:30,322 --> 02:31:31,721
Deep meditation?

3391
02:31:32,024 --> 02:31:33,024
Hello, who's this?

3392
02:31:33,273 --> 02:31:34,821
Stop acting. It's me, Aravind.

3393
02:31:34,883 --> 02:31:35,610
What do you want?

3394
02:31:35,735 --> 02:31:37,070
Dude, an important matter.

3395
02:31:37,203 --> 02:31:38,756
Don't mistake that I'm
conveying it over a call

3396
02:31:38,780 --> 02:31:40,222
I'm getting
engaged today evening.

3397
02:31:40,281 --> 02:31:41,359
You're getting engaged?

3398
02:31:41,632 --> 02:31:43,100
How did you find a girl so soon?

3399
02:31:43,219 --> 02:31:44,796
It's the same girl, Thulasi.

3400
02:31:44,851 --> 02:31:45,491
Thulasi?

3401
02:31:45,640 --> 02:31:47,435
Indeed, Thulasi. So what?

3402
02:31:47,554 --> 02:31:49,271
Saami, a small request

3403
02:31:49,543 --> 02:31:52,216
next year, after we have a child, we'll
come to Kasi and get your blessings.

3404
02:31:52,240 --> 02:31:53,240
Bless your chil...

3405
02:31:53,727 --> 02:31:54,227
Dude

3406
02:31:54,587 --> 02:31:56,907
you ruined my wedding that
was supposed to happen,

3407
02:31:57,150 --> 02:31:59,160
and sent me off to Kasi
with these oldies!

3408
02:31:59,245 --> 02:32:01,682
And you want to happily
marry your girlfriend?

3409
02:32:01,949 --> 02:32:04,754
I won't let it happen.
I'll come there! Now!

3410
02:32:04,856 --> 02:32:06,856
My aim is to come there
and ruin you wedding!

3411
02:32:07,199 --> 02:32:08,923
- Grandpa, what's this called?
- Pilgrimage...

3412
02:32:08,947 --> 02:32:11,529
I'm quitting my pilgrimage
to ruin your wedding!

3413
02:32:11,568 --> 02:32:12,482
Stop the bus, Philips!

3414
02:32:12,568 --> 02:32:14,919
- Grandpa, I'm leaving.
- Don't quit the pilgrimage half way.

3415
02:32:14,943 --> 02:32:16,357
It's a sin -Just shut up!

3416
02:32:16,414 --> 02:32:18,349
You won't understand!
Take care oldies!

3417
02:32:19,554 --> 02:32:22,359
There's a vehicle.
Please, give me a lift.

3418
02:32:22,383 --> 02:32:23,094
Get in. Carefully.

3419
02:32:23,124 --> 02:32:24,211
Thanks a lot brother.

3420
02:32:24,296 --> 02:32:26,199
- Does this freezer work?
- Yes, it does. Why?

3421
02:32:26,242 --> 02:32:28,523
- I need load a small sized corpse.
- It can fit any size.

3422
02:32:30,743 --> 02:32:33,617
Stop! Stop! Drop me here.

3423
02:32:33,671 --> 02:32:35,587
Sir, stop! Who are you?

3424
02:32:35,712 --> 02:32:38,767
Do one thing, park the vehicle in car
parking and wait for ten minutes.

3425
02:32:38,946 --> 02:32:41,212
What will I do after parking it?

3426
02:32:41,275 --> 02:32:43,437
The freezer is chilled, right?
Go an lie down in it.

3427
02:32:43,550 --> 02:32:45,189
Sir, such vehicles are
not allowed here.

3428
02:32:45,431 --> 02:32:46,551
Shall I park it inside then?

3429
02:32:46,842 --> 02:32:47,752
Move!

3430
02:32:47,776 --> 02:32:50,464
Sir, if you leave it here the
customers will get upset.

3431
02:32:51,277 --> 02:32:52,695
Stop insulting.

3432
02:32:52,968 --> 02:32:54,857
There are millions of vehicle
in which human can travel.

3433
02:32:54,881 --> 02:32:57,248
But this is the only vehicle a
human will travel after death.

3434
02:32:57,272 --> 02:33:00,351
Don't mess with me. My
curses always work!

3435
02:33:00,398 --> 02:33:03,225
You might end up going in this
tomorrow, with your tongue handing out.

3436
02:33:03,374 --> 02:33:05,814
- Hey! Listen to me.
- Get lost! I've seen better star hotels.

3437
02:33:07,568 --> 02:33:09,435
Smile. Why are you so serious?

3438
02:33:09,521 --> 02:33:10,896
Just click it!

3439
02:33:10,959 --> 02:33:11,959
Ready?

3440
02:33:12,560 --> 02:33:15,357
Is selfie very important now?
Everyone's driving me crazy.

3441
02:33:15,475 --> 02:33:16,170
Control

3442
02:33:16,272 --> 02:33:19,306
I must stop the reception!
Don't change your mind!

3443
02:33:30,265 --> 02:33:31,632
Swami, I hear that

3444
02:33:31,728 --> 02:33:35,749
you took a vow to be bachelor
so that my son can get married?

3445
02:33:37,797 --> 02:33:40,316
I feel so proud of your friendship.

3446
02:33:40,340 --> 02:33:41,627
Don't get so emotional.

3447
02:33:42,291 --> 02:33:43,435
He came back, right?

3448
02:33:43,927 --> 02:33:46,162
Let's see what all disguise
he'll put for friendship.

3449
02:33:46,224 --> 02:33:49,763
Dad's he ain't that big a deal.
Bro, your costume is funny.

3450
02:33:49,919 --> 02:33:51,106
How about a selfie?

3451
02:33:51,130 --> 02:33:53,466
You better leave! Leave!

3452
02:33:54,982 --> 02:33:56,840
Don't eat and leave like a guest.

3453
02:33:56,864 --> 02:33:59,135
You must stay back
and serve the guests.

3454
02:34:00,111 --> 02:34:01,768
Oh God! Oh God! Sorry.

3455
02:34:04,705 --> 02:34:06,057
So what are you up to tonight?

3456
02:34:06,448 --> 02:34:07,045
The priest is here.

3457
02:34:07,079 --> 02:34:08,289
Greetings, buddy.

3458
02:34:08,459 --> 02:34:10,185
Saaminathan back from Kasi.

3459
02:34:10,498 --> 02:34:13,310
Dude, done with your pilgrimage?

3460
02:34:13,536 --> 02:34:15,239
Where are the offerings,
hidden in your back pocket?

3461
02:34:15,263 --> 02:34:16,982
No, it's in my car bonnet

3462
02:34:17,014 --> 02:34:19,614
I'll show you when we go down.
Stop it with your sarcasm!

3463
02:34:19,850 --> 02:34:20,850
Dude, I'm with family.

3464
02:34:21,147 --> 02:34:23,293
Why are you provoking my brother?

3465
02:34:23,378 --> 02:34:25,113
Poor guy -Come again!

3466
02:34:25,278 --> 02:34:26,723
Your brother? Poor guy? You...

3467
02:34:26,841 --> 02:34:28,036
Hi. Congrats Aravind...

3468
02:34:28,090 --> 02:34:29,761
Wall clock, right? Get lost.

3469
02:34:30,098 --> 02:34:31,978
Bringing wall clock as
gift for every reception!

3470
02:34:32,622 --> 02:34:33,981
Dear navy guy...

3471
02:34:34,059 --> 02:34:34,919
Tell me Mr. Support.

3472
02:34:34,965 --> 02:34:37,330
"A rumour was sparked up that dark
skinned people are low class."

3473
02:34:37,354 --> 02:34:40,127
"Put an end to that rumours, damn it!"
You gave a political statement,

3474
02:34:40,151 --> 02:34:42,954
and you broke up with her
saying "This case is closed".

3475
02:34:43,032 --> 02:34:44,112
Now, what's happening here?

3476
02:34:44,143 --> 02:34:45,561
- Did you get bribed?
- Look.

3477
02:34:45,759 --> 02:34:47,285
Hey, do eat...

3478
02:34:48,074 --> 02:34:49,918
Do eat and go.

3479
02:34:49,980 --> 02:34:51,137
Ms "Dare to wear hat".

3480
02:34:51,300 --> 02:34:53,722
He insulted you so bad that day.

3481
02:34:53,823 --> 02:34:55,065
Yet you're so shameless!

3482
02:34:57,144 --> 02:34:59,082
Aren't you ashamed
to pose like this?

3483
02:34:59,634 --> 02:35:00,134
Brother...

3484
02:35:00,361 --> 02:35:03,253
I agreed to this wedding and
I'm posing for photos

3485
02:35:03,418 --> 02:35:05,027
because of you.

3486
02:35:05,612 --> 02:35:06,745
- Me?
- Yes.

3487
02:35:07,057 --> 02:35:09,846
After breaking up with him
in the coffee shop...

3488
02:35:09,916 --> 02:35:11,721
I thought I'll also forget him.

3489
02:35:12,401 --> 02:35:14,190
But that last statement you said..

3490
02:35:14,315 --> 02:35:15,049
Remember?

3491
02:35:15,120 --> 02:35:16,229
But now I tell you this!

3492
02:35:16,447 --> 02:35:18,612
If you marry and have a kid

3493
02:35:18,643 --> 02:35:21,800
that kid will yearn for an
uncle and go into depression!

3494
02:35:22,931 --> 02:35:24,041
This is not a statement!

3495
02:35:24,704 --> 02:35:26,555
My curse! My curse! My curse!

3496
02:35:26,634 --> 02:35:28,267
Yeah, I said so. Now what?

3497
02:35:28,750 --> 02:35:31,586
My dad doesn't have any
friends or relatives

3498
02:35:31,748 --> 02:35:34,647
I have never had an
uncle from childhood.

3499
02:35:35,310 --> 02:35:37,912
My kids shouldn't face that.
Hence...

3500
02:35:37,988 --> 02:35:40,948
I let go of my ego and called him.

3501
02:35:41,272 --> 02:35:43,880
She called and told me that she agrees
to get married on the same dais.

3502
02:35:43,904 --> 02:35:45,516
And asked me to call you

3503
02:35:45,850 --> 02:35:47,593
I told her that you went
to Kasi and became a saint.

3504
02:35:47,617 --> 02:35:49,257
Told her that you'll
bless us over a call.

3505
02:35:49,366 --> 02:35:51,582
But you came in
person to bless us.

3506
02:35:51,675 --> 02:35:52,769
You're swag!

3507
02:35:53,801 --> 02:35:55,637
So you both got
united because of...

3508
02:35:56,152 --> 02:35:57,308
Of course you!

3509
02:35:57,629 --> 02:35:59,019
The reason I became a saint...

3510
02:35:59,370 --> 02:36:00,776
Once again, of course you!

3511
02:36:00,869 --> 02:36:01,869
God!

3512
02:36:03,073 --> 02:36:03,573
Dude

3513
02:36:04,043 --> 02:36:05,535
will you buy me a beer? Please.

3514
02:36:06,089 --> 02:36:07,628
I'll change the saint
attire and drink.

3515
02:36:07,683 --> 02:36:09,098
Buddy, it's a star hotel.

3516
02:36:09,160 --> 02:36:11,886
It'd be very costly. Go
out, take a left and...

3517
02:36:12,799 --> 02:36:14,667
I know that shop.
I'll buy it myself.

3518
02:36:15,834 --> 02:36:17,119
Buddy, I've a last wish.

3519
02:36:17,321 --> 02:36:18,641
Can I take a photo with you guys?

3520
02:36:18,689 --> 02:36:19,689
Okay, dude.

3521
02:36:19,760 --> 02:36:21,072
- Are you okay with it?
- His attire!

3522
02:36:21,096 --> 02:36:22,854
Dude, at least change the shirt.

3523
02:36:23,275 --> 02:36:24,435
What's wrong with this shirt?

3524
02:36:25,220 --> 02:36:26,220
Not looking good.

3525
02:36:26,767 --> 02:36:27,451
Yes...

3526
02:36:27,781 --> 02:36:28,781
God bless you.

3527
02:36:29,524 --> 02:36:30,524
God bless you.

3528
02:36:31,009 --> 02:36:32,800
I'm leaving -Saami!

3529
02:36:33,555 --> 02:36:34,555
Watch out. Don't fall.

3530
02:36:36,360 --> 02:36:39,532
"Beware, he will act like a friend."

3531
02:36:39,734 --> 02:36:42,931
"Later don't regret when
he stabs you from back."

3532
02:36:43,282 --> 02:36:46,712
"He will say you're swag and
make you over confident."

3533
02:36:46,884 --> 02:36:50,173
"But the moment he finds a girlfriend,
he will cut ties with you."

3534
02:36:50,352 --> 02:36:53,900
"We were buddies! Best friends!"

3535
02:36:54,032 --> 02:36:57,531
"But this case is closed
and we are parting ways."

3536
02:36:58,847 --> 02:37:00,841
You're leaving your
friend but why the scarf?

3537
02:37:01,357 --> 02:37:01,857
What?

3538
02:37:01,905 --> 02:37:04,225
Take it. It may come handy to
use as pillow while sleeping.

3539
02:37:09,908 --> 02:37:11,208
Everything is over.

3540
02:37:11,908 --> 02:37:13,604
To hell with friendship.

3541
02:37:17,582 --> 02:37:18,582
Hi.

3542
02:37:19,732 --> 02:37:20,857
You are...

3543
02:37:24,028 --> 02:37:25,028
What's your name?

3544
02:37:25,707 --> 02:37:26,707
Preethi!

3545
02:37:27,293 --> 02:37:28,793
Preethi! How are you?

3546
02:37:28,924 --> 02:37:30,923
You used to message me.
No reply of late.

3547
02:37:30,962 --> 02:37:32,486
No! No! I forgot.

3548
02:37:33,087 --> 02:37:34,350
I totally forgot.

3549
02:37:34,484 --> 02:37:35,484
You forgot?

3550
02:37:36,766 --> 02:37:37,884
What are you doing here?

3551
02:37:38,119 --> 02:37:39,454
Here with family for lunch?

3552
02:37:39,564 --> 02:37:41,220
No, to attend Aravind's reception.

3553
02:37:42,195 --> 02:37:43,822
And you're asking me the way to it?

3554
02:37:45,104 --> 02:37:46,627
Go straight and take left.

3555
02:37:46,940 --> 02:37:48,650
You'll see a 25 liters flower vase.

3556
02:37:48,713 --> 02:37:49,833
It going on right beside it.

3557
02:37:50,979 --> 02:37:52,389
See you -Why don't you join me?

3558
02:37:52,850 --> 02:37:54,209
No, thanks. You carry on.

3559
02:37:54,639 --> 02:37:56,490
Just now for an emotional bgm...

3560
02:37:56,616 --> 02:37:58,498
I walked out in slow
motion and set up a mood

3561
02:37:58,701 --> 02:38:00,068
I won't have respect if I go back.

3562
02:38:00,568 --> 02:38:01,068
You carry on.

3563
02:38:01,299 --> 02:38:02,370
Come for my sake.

3564
02:38:02,526 --> 02:38:04,206
Preethi don't force me.

3565
02:38:04,667 --> 02:38:06,467
Fine, leave -Hold on.

3566
02:38:08,565 --> 02:38:11,853
If I come with you, will you buy me
a pint booze after I finish my vow?

3567
02:38:11,956 --> 02:38:13,526
I'll buy a full bottle!

3568
02:38:13,744 --> 02:38:14,439
Come on

3569
02:38:14,572 --> 02:38:17,286
- I won't talk to him. Don't force me.
- Come on.

3570
02:38:17,338 --> 02:38:18,728
Don't lie!

3571
02:38:31,794 --> 02:38:33,354
- Congratulations, dear.
- Thanks uncle.

3572
02:38:33,584 --> 02:38:35,232
Congratulations, Saaminathan.

3573
02:38:39,584 --> 02:38:40,391
Congrats bro.

3574
02:38:40,566 --> 02:38:42,168
Dear Mr. Support.

3575
02:38:43,940 --> 02:38:46,817
All of you go and eat. Go! Go!

3576
02:38:46,879 --> 02:38:49,262
Come on, darling. Look
what all I've to do.

3577
02:38:49,878 --> 02:38:51,575
Congratulations, Mr. Saaminathan.

3578
02:38:51,604 --> 02:38:53,345
Congratulations? I don't understand.

3579
02:38:53,369 --> 02:38:55,404
As you wished, tomorrow
you and your college

3580
02:38:55,428 --> 02:38:57,097
girlfriend, Preethi
are getting married.

3581
02:38:57,137 --> 02:38:58,137
A wedding?

3582
02:38:58,613 --> 02:38:59,613
Yes.

3583
02:39:04,060 --> 02:39:05,716
Thulasi, is this
some new prank show?

3584
02:39:06,115 --> 02:39:08,182
You made him wear a hat.
What's for me? A sweater?

3585
02:39:09,267 --> 02:39:10,806
Where's the hidden camera? Come out

3586
02:39:10,891 --> 02:39:12,446
I found out. Now, come out.

3587
02:39:12,586 --> 02:39:14,906
Nothing like that, my brother.

3588
02:39:15,080 --> 02:39:18,375
As you wished, the wedding will take
place tomorrow on the same dais.

3589
02:39:18,610 --> 02:39:19,882
- Happy?
- Yes.

3590
02:39:20,374 --> 02:39:21,374
Yeah, it's true.

3591
02:39:21,443 --> 02:39:22,443
Sorry, Saami

3592
02:39:22,548 --> 02:39:25,946
I must have accepted your
proposal during college farewell.

3593
02:39:26,760 --> 02:39:27,760
I missed out.

3594
02:39:28,423 --> 02:39:29,423
What to do?

3595
02:39:29,618 --> 02:39:31,318
Sometimes we learn
only after we suffer.

3596
02:39:32,510 --> 02:39:33,581
Will you accept my love?

3597
02:39:34,191 --> 02:39:35,831
Preethi, come on...

3598
02:39:36,081 --> 02:39:37,081
Dude...

3599
02:39:37,409 --> 02:39:40,198
The Preethi I fell in love during
college, wants me to accept her love

3600
02:39:40,307 --> 02:39:41,253
I just can't believe it.

3601
02:39:41,294 --> 02:39:42,536
How did this happen?

3602
02:39:43,122 --> 02:39:44,145
Well, buddy...

3603
02:39:44,294 --> 02:39:46,687
I didn't feel like leaving
you and getting married.

3604
02:39:46,757 --> 02:39:48,148
So I called up Preethi yesterday.

3605
02:39:48,304 --> 02:39:49,864
It all ended up so well.

3606
02:39:49,974 --> 02:39:51,474
How was the surprise?

3607
02:39:52,187 --> 02:39:54,452
Come on, buddy! Awesome!

3608
02:39:54,591 --> 02:39:55,271
Thank you!

3609
02:39:55,381 --> 02:39:57,881
You postponed your wedding
for six months for my sake.

3610
02:39:58,453 --> 02:39:59,805
All these days I said from here.

3611
02:40:00,156 --> 02:40:01,265
Now I say from here!

3612
02:40:01,289 --> 02:40:02,367
Dude, you are swag!

3613
02:40:02,906 --> 02:40:04,446
You're swag! Swag! Swag!

3614
02:40:05,173 --> 02:40:07,461
Fine, you're meeting
Preethi after a long time.

3615
02:40:07,586 --> 02:40:08,681
Talk to her and...

3616
02:40:10,134 --> 02:40:12,447
Stop wondering. Let's go, come on.

3617
02:40:12,525 --> 02:40:14,925
Bye -What's the plan for our
first night? You didn't tell me.

3618
02:40:16,525 --> 02:40:17,525
Preethi...

3619
02:40:17,729 --> 02:40:18,729
Tell me, Saami.

3620
02:40:19,072 --> 02:40:21,611
You still look like how you
were in college. So beautiful.

3621
02:40:22,002 --> 02:40:23,002
Saami

3622
02:40:23,041 --> 02:40:23,949
will you marry me?

3623
02:40:24,041 --> 02:40:25,041
Of course.

3624
02:40:25,926 --> 02:40:27,268
Stop making me blush!

3625
02:40:29,334 --> 02:40:30,334
Mommy!

3626
02:40:30,814 --> 02:40:31,814
Careful.

3627
02:40:32,897 --> 02:40:35,351
Like in those beauty soap ads,
she just called you "mommy".

3628
02:40:36,077 --> 02:40:37,928
My daughter will
obviously call me mommy.

3629
02:40:38,805 --> 02:40:40,076
How else will she address me?

3630
02:40:40,990 --> 02:40:41,608
I don't get it.

3631
02:40:41,858 --> 02:40:42,903
That's what I told you.

3632
02:40:43,168 --> 02:40:45,988
Sometimes in life we learn
only after we suffer
