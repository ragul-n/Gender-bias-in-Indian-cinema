1
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,640
Look, all these people are useless. Only you are my own.

2
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,640
Accompany me throughout my life.

3
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,480
Dear, you had been blessed by luck.

4
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,280
And you are shrewd enough to leave me with all this trouble.

5
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,760
Babu, bring my tea!

6
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,720
The animals of our zoo have woken up.

7
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,720
Babu! Get up!

8
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,400
It's begun all over again.

9
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,080
Babu! Where is my breakfast?

10
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,320
I'll get it! - Babu, get me some milk!

11
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,400
Yes, will get it.

12
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,160
Babu, where is my toast? - Coming up!

13
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,760
Babu! Warm water for bathing!

14
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,720
Coming up! - Babu! My clothes!

15
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,160
No! I won't do it! I'm not going to do anything! I'm going mad!

16
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,240
Babu? Babu?

17
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,240
Where are you going? - I've gone crazy.

18
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,120
My head is spinning!

19
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,680
You make me work so much.

20
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,560
But you hardly pay me anything!

21
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,440
T-To hell with you! - Yes.

22
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,760
Greetings, sir. And take care of yourself.

23
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,800
Useless fellows! Babu is gone!

24
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,920
Now you can do the chores yourselves!

25
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,000
To hell with you!

26
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,440
Listen! Wake up!

27
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,440
Babu has quit the job! Get up! - What? Has Babu left the job?

28
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,560
Yes! - Oh, no!

29
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,360
Listen! Wake up!

30
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,360
Babu has escaped! - What?

31
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,480
Meena! Where's my tea?

32
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,640
Meena! I have to get to work. Please iron my clothes.

33
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,840
Please get me some warm water for a bath, Meena.

34
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,280
Meena! How about some breakfast?

35
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,240
Now that Babu is gone, they'll make life miserable for the poor orphan.

36
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,600
My henpecked sons will never ask their wives to work.

37
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,640
Grandpa, there's nothing wrong with working.

38
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,480
If I'm here then why should my aunts work?

39
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,680
Besides, I'm the youngest. - So is Lakshmi's daughter.

40
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,120
Why doesn't she do the chores? - Forget it. I like doing it.

41
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,600
Now have a cup of tea.

42
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,320
Go serve them first. I will have it later. - Grandpa.

43
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,480
I won't serve anyone else before I've served you. Now take this cup.

44
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,560
Now, smile!

45
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,280
That's like a good boy.

46
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,360
Tea coming up!

47
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,880
What's going on?

48
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,720
Not a single servant stays in this house.

49
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,720
This is such a big house. How can a servant handle so much?

50
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,040
We should employ two servants. - Who will pay them?

51
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,600
Your father will, of course!

52
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,760
He's sitting tight over a pile of cash.

53
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,080
What are you doing? - Can't he pay two servants?

54
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,000
Dad thinks that he has done more than enough as a father.

55
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,320
He brought us up, got us married, gave us a place to live in.

56
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,480
Now it's up to us to earn our livelihoods.

57
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,640
How about a cup of hot tea? - Tea!

58
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,280
Good morning, Uncle and Aunt. - Good morning.

59
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,680
Have a cup of tea. - No. I don't want tea.

60
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,480
Is Dimple not up yet?

61
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,280
Don't wake her up.

62
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,680
She returned from the disco at 2 in the night. - I see!

63
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,080
Give her a glass of warm milk when she gets up. - Sure.

64
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,320
Bye. - Bye.

65
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,040
Do you think it's right for a girl to come home this late?

66
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,280
It's perfectly all right!

67
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,920
You haven't given me a reply. - To what?

68
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,520
You don't even try to understand!

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,480
If we live apart, we can afford a servant, at least.

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,240
And we're a small family of 3. The servant would come cheap.

71
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,280
Fool, if we leave, Dad will give this house to my elder brother.

72
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,120
Do you realise the value of this house in these times?

73
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
Piping hot tea!

74
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,520
Good morning, Uncle. Good morning, Aunt.

75
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,080
Good morning. - Here you are.

76
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,360
Please iron my clothes. I have to get to work. - Sure.

77
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,520
Where's Rinku? He has to go to school.

78
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,520
He has left already. - I see.

79
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,080
You've left me saddled with an untuned musician!

80
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,080
He hasn't even brushed his teeth. And that cacophony rankles me!

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Uncle!

82
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,840
Uncle! - What is it?

83
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,160
I'll miss school for your sake. - How come?

84
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,840
Because you asked me to tell you how I find your tunes.

85
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,880
And you haven't yet finished a single tune!

86
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,080
I'm in a fix. I've gone over all the songs, old and new.

87
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,160
But the music directors haven't spared a single tune

88
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,360
that I can plagiarise. But I'm still trying..

89
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,640
Hold it! What's that you're singing?

90
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,240
I'm not singing. I was just going over the multiplication tables.

91
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,840
Oh, whatever! Just do it loud and clear.

92
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,600
Two ones are two. Two twos are four.

93
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,600
Two threes are six. - That's it!

94
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,160
Got it!

95
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,760
Great! I found the tune!

96
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,320
It's tough to score a tune. Isn't that so, Uncle?

97
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,080
True. But the kid wouldn't understand that.

98
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,040
Oh, yes! You work so hard at it. - That's true.

99
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,080
First one has to listen to the English songs. - Correct!

100
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,680
And then you must plagiarise these into Hindi tunes.

101
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,120
That's not a joke! Isn't that so, Uncle Pappi?

102
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,760
You're poking fun at me, aren't you?

103
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,880
Not at all! - Where do you think

104
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,400
you're running away? - Please! I was just joking!

105
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,240
Dad! - What is it?

106
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,320
Will you stop wailing and say something?

107
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,560
Must you cry out of tune, Sister? Just tell us what is the matter?

108
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,240
Oh! How to tell you, Dad? I've left Sunil once and for all!

109
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,360
Really? - What are you saying?

110
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,920
What do you mean?

111
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,560
This is a marriage! Not a rented apartment you can walk out of!

112
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,920
What else could I have done, Dad?

113
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,720
Sunil used to wake me up early!

114
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,880
He used to force me to make tea, cook breakfast and do the chores!

115
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,640
I told him that if he only wanted someone to look after his home

116
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,360
then he could have hired a maid, instead!

117
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,120
As it is, we don't even have a servant. And she walks in!

118
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,440
What? - I mean to say

119
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,600
that she shouldn't have left him at this point of time.

120
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,840
I left my husband to come to my father's house!

121
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,640
I haven't come here to become a burden on you.

122
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,880
Okay, fine.

123
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,840
Come with me, Aunt. Let me get you a glass of water.

124
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,920
Get me something to eat. I'm famished!

125
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,000
Come. You can eat all you want.

126
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,280
You just speak nonsense.

127
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,760
I can only pray that Meena gets

128
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,760
married into a decent family.

129
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,720
Who is this?

130
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,000
It is past 7:30 a.m. And you are still asleep!

131
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,560
What is this, Dad? I was seeing such a lovely dream!

132
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,520
So, you were dreaming, is it? And what was this dream like?

133
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,360
I was standing in a picturesque place. And I basked in solitude.

134
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,480
There was no one with me. Nor were you there.

135
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,040
You dream of such nonsense! That's why you sleep till late.

136
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,440
Get ready fast. Otherwise you won't get breakfast after 8 o'clock.

137
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,440
Oh, God! Why was the clock invented?

138
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,720
Good morning, Dad.

139
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,000
Give me!

140
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,240
Haven't you taken a bath?

141
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,800
You already had me shower in the morning.

142
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,680
Why to waste water and time over another shower? - Is it?

143
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,680
'8 a.m.'

144
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,360
Time for breakfast is over.

145
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,800
Dad, the clock could be ahead of time.

146
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,480
But my son, that clock could possibly be running late.

147
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,560
Now get up. - But, Dad..

148
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,280
I expect to see you in the office at 9 a.m. sharp. - Dad?

149
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,800
Dad?

150
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,800
Dad!

151
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,280
Mr. Sharma! Are you ready?

152
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,640
Let's hurry up! Oh, my God.

153
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,120
I mustn't be late!

154
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,800
Have you got the brick? - Yes.

155
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,160
Give it to me. - Sir, here is the brick.

156
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,560
Now make a move! You must reach the office before I do. - Yes.

157
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,560
Must he do this every day! It seems he was born late?

158
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,160
Yes!

159
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,120
Make sure that this file reaches me by this evening. - Yes.

160
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,360
All right!

161
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,800
All right.

162
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,000
Very good morning, sir.

163
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,360
I am on time.

164
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,640
Good morning, sir.

165
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,760
Hello. - Sir.

166
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,280
What?

167
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,240
Sir.

168
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:57,800
What?

169
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,120
What?

170
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,280
Shut up, man.

171
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,920
Your towel is falling out.

172
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,360
The towel is showing. - I've seen it.

173
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,920
Look at this. Look at this. The towel is hanging out.

174
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,480
How did it stay in there? - Let me take it out.

175
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,400
Mr. Sharma! What are you doing?

176
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,840
Good morning, sir. - Good morning.

177
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,480
Should I take it out? - You should get out!

178
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,560
Get out. Good morning. - Sir, it's a towel.

179
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,560
Good morning.

180
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,880
How did it stay in there?

181
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,880
Good morning, sir. - Good morning.

182
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,640
Good morning, sir. - Good morning.

183
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,480
Good morning, sir. - Hello, everybody.

184
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,760
Good morning, sir. - Hi. - Good morning, sir.

185
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,680
Sit down.

186
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,680
Get me a pillow. - Yes, sir.

187
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,320
Take a look at this girl.

188
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,480
Wow, sir. She is very pretty.

189
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,840
Sir, if the steno is beautiful and young

190
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,760
then the whole staff will be very lively.

191
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,840
I'm not selecting a stenographer. I've selected her as my son's wife.

192
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,440
In which case, she will boost your morale! Isn't that so, sir?

193
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,160
Whose daughter is she? - I do no know, yet.

194
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,400
The priest has arranged for these photographs.

195
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,480
He'll let us know.

196
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,880
Do one thing. - Sure.

197
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,480
Send this photograph with the file to Raj and tell him that I sent it.

198
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,840
I'll give it to him.

199
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,560
Go on! - Yes!

200
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,360
He stands with his mouth agape! Clown!

201
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,680
Good morning, sir. Good morning, sir.

202
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,480
What is it? - Boss has sent this file for you.

203
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
He wants you to see this file and speak to him over the phone.

204
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,400
Keep it there.

205
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,680
You'll speak to him, won't you? - I will.

206
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:49,720
Hi, Father.

207
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,280
Have you been through the file?

208
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,320
I have a pile to go through already.

209
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,480
Put the other files away. Just go through the file I've sent you.

210
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,680
What's so special in this file?

211
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,120
Your marriage proposal lies in it.

212
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:06,480
You'll find a girl's photo inside it. You will marry her.

213
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,280
Dad! Is this the girl? - Yes. Do you like her?

214
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm not going to marry this girl! - I am not asking for your opinion.

215
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,040
I'm telling you that you are going to marry this girl. Do you get it?

216
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,000
That's all. - Dad!

217
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,360
I'll marry a girl of my choice. It's a question of my life! - Yes.

218
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,800
Do you mean to say that I'm your enemy?

219
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,240
You aren't exactly being friendly. - What do you mean?

220
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,480
Take a look at this girl. What's wrong with her?

221
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,360
Beautiful! - Do you like her? - Sure.

222
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,280
Then marry her. - Sure.

223
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,480
Take a look for yourself. What's wrong with her?

224
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Father, I don't like her. She is so fat.

225
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,560
How dare you refuse me, idiot! Let go of my hand!

226
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,240
All right! I'll call the matchmaker right away.

227
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,120
I'll finalise this proposal! Let's see how he evades the marriage.

228
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,400
Let go of my hand! - I let go of it long ago.

229
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,280
Let's see how he evades the marriage.

230
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,280
Grandpa! Dear, Grandpa! Take a look at this!

231
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,800
What's up? - I stood first in my college!

232
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,920
Wonderful! I'm so proud of you!

233
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,320
The University is giving me a prize for excellent scores!

234
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,480
A ticket to Paris. - Really?

235
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,920
It's for a management course. - Yes.

236
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,600
May I go? It's a matter of only 25 days! Please let me go!

237
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,720
That's quite unnecessary. You have had enough of education.

238
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,680
It's time you learnt the household chores.

239
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,560
Degrees are going to be of no use when you live with your in-laws.

240
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,880
She's right.

241
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,400
We'd lose face in society if you do anything wayward in a foreign land!

242
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,840
Of 800 students, I am the only one who has got this chance!

243
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,320
Please let me go! - Don't be sad. You may go.

244
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,800
Okay? - Thank you.

245
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,800
What are you saying? Will you send a young girl abroad all alone?

246
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,600
She isn't going alone. No. - Am I going?

247
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,640
Shanno will accompany you.

248
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,360
Thank you, Grandpa.

249
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,760
Good morning, sir.

250
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,520
Why haven't you gone to the office? The boss is waiting for you.

251
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,040
He has sent me to take you to the office.

252
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,120
Call the office and tell him that I'll go to work on one condition.

253
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,800
He isn't going to discuss this marriage with me.

254
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,680
I'll marry a girl of my own choice.

255
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,760
That's impossible! - Why?

256
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,320
Please don't mind me saying this. In this house, you can't even eat

257
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,360
or drink what you might like! You can't do what you wish.

258
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,560
You can't even wear the clothes of your choice!

259
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,280
How can you marry a girl of your choice?

260
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,640
Mr. Sharma, please don't rouse my temper.

261
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,080
Even if you get into a rage, what can you possibly do?

262
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,240
Can you run away from home? - What are you saying, Mr.Sharma!

263
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,560
Could I ever run away from home!

264
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,560
Open the gate!

265
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,760
I'll travel all over the world! And I won't ever come back home!

266
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,040
Taxi!

267
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,160
Aunt! Hurry up! - Coming!

268
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,640
Taxi! Wait, mister.

269
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,480
Taxi, stop! - Stop the taxi!

270
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,320
The meter is ticking! And the luggage is stowed!

271
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,360
I've taken the cab. Hurry up!

272
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,600
Take the front seat. Hurry up! - Stop!

273
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,840
Excuse me, mister. - Yes?

274
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,480
We're taking this cab! - But I've taken it already.

275
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,640
But I hailed the cab! - You haven't bought it, I presume.

276
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,160
Excuse me, by the way.

277
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,360
I'd give up a 100 cabs for a pretty girl like you!

278
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,040
But not today! Taxi! Move it!

279
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,480
Meena! Our luggage! Stop the cab!

280
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,680
Stop!

281
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,600
Stop!

282
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,720
Stupid.

283
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,000
Come on. - Let's go.

284
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,640
You don't understand, Aunt! They weren't willing to let us go.

285
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,600
If they get to know that we lost our luggage before

286
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,560
we reached the airport. They will insist that more could go wrong.

287
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,120
Our trip could be cancelled!

288
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,040
What are we going to do? We can't wear these clothes for a month!

289
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,680
We can always buy some clothes over there.

290
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,440
If I find that thief, I'll bash him up!

291
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,720
Yes!

292
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,720
Aunt!

293
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,720
Thank you.

294
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,640
You were cursing him a moment ago! And you just thanked him!

295
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,440
We're lucky to have come across such a handsome thief!

296
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,480
I'll fix him!

297
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,160
Excuse me. - You are excused.

298
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,240
How dare you run away with our luggage?

299
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,000
Such manners! I just returned your luggage. And you are accosting me!

300
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:22,800
Shut up.

301
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,040
Had we not come to the airport, how could we have found the luggage?

302
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,080
You've got it back, haven't you?

303
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,080
Meaning? Did you do us a favour? - Oh! Meena!

304
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,000
This man isn't for quarrelling. He's worth of being befriended.

305
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,600
Hello. - Hello.

306
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,760
Aunt, let go of his hand.

307
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,560
A friend! He'd even make an unworthy foe! Let's go!

308
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,000
Excuse me. - Yes?

309
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,160
Comparatively, you seem quite intelligent.

310
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,400
Stupid man.

311
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,360
Crazy fellow!

312
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,240
Have you seen this man? - No.

313
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:50,920
Dad!

314
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,280
Maybe you must have seen him. Please take a look.

315
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,840
Wait a second.

316
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,120
Please hurry up!

317
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,240
Have you seen this man? - Excuse me. I'm busy.

318
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,320
Take a look. You might've.. - Sorry. I don't know.

319
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,320
Are you through? - Yes. - Let's get going.

320
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,760
I've seen her somewhere.. - Forget her. Concentrate on him.

321
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,920
Has anyone seen this man?

322
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,680
This is a public place!

323
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,880
I'm tired. How will I find him? - Let's go to the domestic airport.

324
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,800
Where's that? - Over there.

325
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,000
Excuse me, I think I have seen them somewhere.

326
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,240
So, how am I concerned? - Neither am I! I'm on the run!

327
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,320
Mister, I..

328
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,320
Had his teeth been all right, he would look like my son.

329
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,560
Take that cap away, and it could be him.

330
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,560
Move it. - Yes. - Fool!

331
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,160
"I'd love to have you in all my seven lives."

332
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,440
"I'd love to be in front of your eyes all the time."

333
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,480
"I'd love to have you in all my seven lives."

334
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,760
"I'd love to be in front of your eyes all the time."

335
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,000
"A dream world.."

336
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,240
"I'd love to live in a dream world."

337
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,680
"I'd love to be in front of your eyes all the time."

338
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,480
"I'd love to have you in all my seven lives."

339
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,480
"I'd love to be in front of your eyes all the time."

340
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:26,240
"If you had been Hema Malini. If you had been.."

341
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,800
"If you had been Hema Malini."

342
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,480
"I'd also be.."

343
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,240
"I'd also be Dharmendra, wouldn't I?"

344
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,760
"I'd love to be in front of your eyes all the time."

345
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,480
"I'd love to have you in all my seven lives."

346
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,480
"I'd love to be in front of your eyes all the time."

347
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:13,120
"If you had been Dimple Kapadia. If you had been.."

348
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,680
"If you had been Dimple Kapadia."

349
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,360
"I'd also be.."

350
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,080
"I'd also be Kaka, wouldn't I?"

351
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,600
"I'd love to be in front of your eyes all the time."

352
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,400
"I'd love to have you in all my seven lives."

353
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,400
"I'd love to be in front of your eyes all the time."

354
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:11,040
"If you had been Jaya Bhaduri. If you had been.."

355
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,600
"If you had been Jaya Bhaduri."

356
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,280
"I'd also be.."

357
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,000
"I'd also be Lamboo, wouldn't I?"

358
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,480
"I'd love to be in front of your eyes all the time."

359
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,280
"I'd love to have you in all my seven lives."

360
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,280
"I'd love to be in front of your eyes all the time."

361
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,480
Have you made a reservation? - Yes. It has been reserved.

362
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,600
That was a good thing you did. - Oh, yes. Now, hurry up!

363
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,360
Excuse me. Good afternoon. - Hello, good afternoon.

364
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,560
My name is Meena Nath. I have a reservation.

365
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,440
Yes. Did you have a nice trip?

366
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,880
Yes, very nice.

367
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,360
Very nice, thank you. - Oh, good. You can fill up here.

368
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,680
Yes, sure.

369
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,560
This is the key to your room. - Thank you.

370
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,560
Go on. I'll fill the form and come upstairs.

371
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,560
Yes, come quickly.

372
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,480
Aunt! You've gone off to sleep, already?

373
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,320
You should have washed before going to bed.

374
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,600
Are you tired?

375
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,680
Even I'm tired. I'm going for a bath.

376
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,360
Order something to eat. I'm famished.

377
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,360
Now get up! Come on!

378
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,080
Aunt! I got a hug!

379
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,480
Give me the gown quickly.

380
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,240
Hold on.

381
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,040
Now where is the gown?

382
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,040
Quick! - I'm getting it.

383
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,400
/Take it. - Thank you.

384
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,720
Aunt, have you brought Uncle's gown along?

385
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:17,680
"If you had been Saira Banu. If you had been.."

386
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,440
"If you had been Saira Banu."

387
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,040
"I'd also be.."

388
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,720
"I'd also be Yusuf, wouldn't I?"

389
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,320
"I'd love to be in front of your eyes all the time."

390
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,000
"I'd love to have you in my every reincarnation."

391
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,480
"I'd love to be in front of your eyes all the time." - You!

392
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,440
It's my room. It's my gown. It's my cheek. But the slap is yours.

393
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,000
That's quite unfair.

394
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,480
No! - What are you saying?

395
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,680
Get a hold on that temper. Else, you're likely to lose your shirt.

396
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,440
Shut up!

397
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,520
What are you doing here, Meena? You were cursing him all the while.

398
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,840
And here you are, in his room! You fooled me all right.

399
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,320
You should've taken me into confidence, at least.

400
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,760
It's nothing like that! I came into this donkey's room by mistake.

401
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,440
A mistake? - Do you mean donkey?

402
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,600
Yes, I mean donkey.

403
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,360
Is it? - Let's go.

404
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,480
Excuse me.

405
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,120
That's my gown. Leave it here.

406
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,080
I'll return it after changing. - Make sure you wash it.

407
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,920
We'll have it ironed, too. We're in the room across.

408
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,280
Come over for tea. Let's chat. It'd be fun.

409
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,640
Okay. All right. - Hey, just a minute.

410
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,400
We won't stay here! - Where would you go?

411
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,400
There's no dearth of hotels. We'll put up elsewhere.

412
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,280
No better a view than in here. - You are more sensible by far!

413
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,480
If we stay here, I'll have to see his face! I don't want to see it!

414
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,160
And your face isn't the prettiest face in the world, you know!

415
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,800
Okay, no problem. It's okay. - Okay, it's alright. No problem.

416
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,240
Take her away before I throw her out!

417
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,520
Get lost.

418
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,920
Let's go. Let's go. Bye. - What is this nonsense?

419
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,440
Sorry, ma'am.

420
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,320
No rooms, ma'am.

421
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,120
Extremely sorry.

422
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,320
Sorry, ma'am. No rooms.

423
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,040
I am very sorry, ma'am.

424
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,160
Aunt?

425
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,480
That's the result of being so stubborn.

426
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,360
We can't find any accommodation. Listen to me. Let's go back.

427
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:09,120
Else, we will have to sleep on the pavements at night.

428
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,160
All right. - That makes sense. Let's go.

429
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,160
Let go. I'll carry it.

430
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,720
What happened? - Our room has been given away.

431
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,600
Accommodation isn't available here. - Oh, God! - What are we to do now?

432
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,840
Have we met?

433
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,640
We had come to your room this morning.

434
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,000
So, are you back?

435
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,880
He is here to rub salt into our wounds.

436
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,560
Unlike you, I pay due regards to my countrymen in a foreign land.

437
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,480
I see! - And especially to women.

438
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,680
You may bring your luggage up to my room.

439
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,160
Didn't I tell you that he's a nice guy? Come on. Let's go.

440
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,400
We don't even know him, Aunt! How can we stay in his room?

441
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,920
How long does it take to get to know people? Step aside, will you?

442
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:49,880
Hello. - Hello.

443
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:50,680
I am Shanno. - Hi.

444
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,480
I am her aunt. She is.. - Meena! And I'm Rajesh.

445
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,520
There! Now we know each other. Come on. Let's go.

446
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,480
I'm not coming. - You can live on the side walk.

447
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,880
It's people like you who give our county a bad name abroad.

448
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,640
How dare you? - Yes, this is true.

449
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,040
What do you mean by, 'It's true'? - Yes.

450
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,600
Just get out from here, okay? - Okay.

451
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,520
What is your problem? - Okay, I'm going. Calm down, baby!

452
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,880
I don't want to give my county a bad name. Rajesh!

453
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,800
Who? Where? You? - Yes.

454
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,560
Okay. I'm ready for you. - Are you coming?

455
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,120
Come on. - Let's go.

456
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,240
Bye.

457
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,160
Ill-mannered idiot! Stupid!

458
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,360
Thank you.

459
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,240
You make sparkling conversation. - The credit goes to you!

460
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,440
Tell me something. Has this girl always been like that?

461
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,320
Or, has she grown up into this? - Let her be what she is!

462
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,320
I'm not like her. - Of course not! You're special!

463
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,320
Thank you. Have some tea. Is it nice? - Oh, yes, thank you.

464
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,120
What is it?

465
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,760
Don't be angry. Come upstairs.

466
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,800
I don't need any help. I'm fine.

467
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,480
You might catch a cold. You might fall sick.

468
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,480
It won't kill me.

469
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,480
Such a temper! Don't her parents admonish her?

470
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,400
They aren't alive. They died when she was an infant.

471
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,400
Oh!

472
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,320
He put me to sleep in his bed! Beside him!

473
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,240
Get up! Else I'll bring this place down!

474
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,480
I hate you..

475
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,480
How about some piping hot tea?

476
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:24,840
She nearly killed me!

477
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,720
Who brought me here? - Your aunt couldn't have picked you up.

478
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,840
I carried you up here.

479
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,360
How dare you pick me up in your arms!

480
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,480
Who do you think you are?

481
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,120
I can't tolerate this any more. Get out of here!

482
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,480
Okay.

483
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,560
Relax. Calm down!

484
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:52,640
What you've done is terribly wrong! How is he at fault?

485
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:59,280
You would have been more sensible had you taken ill or been abducted.

486
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,400
But I liked the boy as soon as I saw him.

487
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,920
You won't be able to find anyone better.

488
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:15,440
Look at me. I didn't get the happiness I expected from marriage.

489
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,080
You've been bumping into him ever since we saw him in Mumbai.

490
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,520
God might have made him for you.

491
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,920
Stop him, Meena.

492
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,720
Stop him before he goes too far away from you.

493
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,720
Go on! Go, Meena.

494
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,440
Excuse me. Can I have a rose please? - Sure.

495
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,440
Thank you. - Welcome.

496
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,640
Hey, I am sorry. Please.

497
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,880
Hi. How do you do?

498
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,560
What's your name and where are you from?

499
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,920
Raj.. - Rajshri.

500
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,320
I'm sorry for what I did. Please listen to me!

501
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,480
I'm apologising to you! And you won't even look at me!

502
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,360
I like your mascara very much. - Stop it.

503
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,720
Don't talk to him. - Stupid girl. Don't look at her.

504
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,240
Just talk to me. Okay? - I'm apologising to you!

505
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,080
What would you like to have? - Please! Take this!

506
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,800
Take this. Take this. A beautiful rose for a beautiful girl.

507
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,920
Raj!

508
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,800
Hi, folks. Hey, waiter. Come on.

509
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,320
Hi, baby. - Hi, guys.

510
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,880
Come on. Get up, Tony.

511
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,000
So well, what are your plans?

512
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,040
What a beautiful babe! - Thank you. - Beautiful.

513
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,240
You are so friendly.

514
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,040
Come on.

515
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,800
Hi. - Come on. Come on.

516
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,520
Such unfriendly people out here. But you guys are so friendly!

517
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,760
"Staying alive. Staying alive. Yes. Yes. Yes."

518
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,680
I love you, baby. You are alone. I am alone.

519
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,480
Let go! Let me go!

520
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,320
Raj!

521
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,600
Come on, baby. Let me go.

522
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,880
Raj!

523
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,880
Let go of me.

524
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,760
'That's my hero!'

525
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,720
"Your heart is so admirable, just like gold."

526
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,480
"Listen to what my heartbeat wants to say."

527
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,120
"Your heart is so admirable, just like gold."

528
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,720
"Listen to what my heartbeat wants to say."

529
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,080
"You are mine.."

530
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,520
"You are my, hero number one!"

531
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
"You are mine.."

532
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,000
"You are my, hero number one!"

533
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,440
"Your heart is so admirable, just like gold."

534
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,080
"Listen to what my heartbeat wants to say."

535
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,480
"You are mine.."

536
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,680
"You are my, hero number one!"

537
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,400
"You are mine.."

538
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,400
"You are my, hero number one!"

539
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:05,080
"You are my hero. Don't act like a villain."

540
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:13,480
"Don't give a bad name to the queen of your dreams."

541
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,080
"You are my hero. Don't act like a villain."

542
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,720
"Don't give a bad name to the queen of your dreams."

543
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,320
"Oh, beloved, in love, you should not be too obsessive."

544
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,640
"You are mine.."

545
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,920
"You are my, hero number one!"

546
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,520
"You are mine.."

547
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,520
"You are my, hero number one!"

548
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,520
"It is so hot inside while it's so cold outside."

549
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,520
"Look, oh, heartless, what you have done to me!"

550
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,440
"It is so hot inside while it's so cold outside."

551
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,080
"Look, oh, heartless, what you have done to me!"

552
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,720
"Make me a part of your life and heart. Don't aggravate my dilemma."

553
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,720
"You are mine.."

554
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,280
"You are my, hero number one!"

555
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,720
"You are mine.."

556
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,040
"You are my, hero number one!"

557
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,680
"Your heart is so admirable, just like gold."

558
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:47,320
"Listen to what my heartbeat wants to say."

559
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,920
"Your heart is so admirable, just like gold."

560
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,640
"Listen to what my heartbeat wants to say."

561
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,920
"I am yours.."

562
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,280
"I am your, hero number one!"

563
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,920
"You are mine.."

564
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,920
"You are my, hero number one!"

565
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,680
'I'm going to marry a girl of my choice.'

566
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,720
Where have you gone, son? You've left your father behind.

567
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:30,120
After you left, I realised how lonely I am without you.

568
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,080
Come back to me, son!

569
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,640
I won't order you around any more. I swear! You can do what you want.

570
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,560
I'll smash all the clocks in the house.

571
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,480
You can sleep all day and wake all night. Do what you want!

572
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,480
Have dinners for lunch! Eat breakfasts at dinner!

573
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,040
Marry who you want to!

574
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,480
But please don't put your father to test!

575
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,040
Sir! Sir! Sir!

576
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,880
Good news, sir! - Has my son been traced?

577
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,080
Yes. He's in Switzerland.

578
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,400
We've received Citibank card bills from Switzerland.

579
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,360
But there's bad news, too. - What?

580
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,120
Last week he ate food worth Rs. 2, 500!

581
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,600
Fool! - Sir!

582
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,720
After all, he's my son! He can spend

583
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,040
that much on food. What's wrong with it?

584
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,080
Besides, he's gone to Switzerland. Not a holiday in the suburbs.

585
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,640
And I'm going there in pursuit of my son.

586
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,080
And I am coming with you!

587
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,040
Where are you going? - To Switzerland!

588
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,080
You? - Stop gesticulating.

589
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,480
And shut your mouth.

590
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,400
I can't do it. There's a problem.

591
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,080
They won't let people like you enter Switzerland.

592
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,080
They will. Many others have.

593
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,240
Sir! Over there! Look! - Where?

594
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:52,400
There! A white woman! She's so fair!

595
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,560
We are here looking for my son. Not white women!

596
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,840
If you ever stare at a white woman again, I'll thrash you!

597
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,600
Have you seen this boy? - No.

598
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:02,560
Excuse me. - No.

599
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,480
Have you seen this boy? - No. - He is my son.

600
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,480
Have you seen him? - No.

601
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,120
This boy. Have you seen him? - No.

602
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,480
Sir! Over there! Look! - Where?

603
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,480
There! Look at the mountain full of snow!

604
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,080
Sit straight. Why are you trying to make me angry?

605
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,640
Sorry, sir.

606
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,840
Isn't this a lovely place? This is a lovely place!

607
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,400
You look nice in the hat. - I'll thrash you.

608
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,480
But I am not wearing a hat.

609
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,040
Sir! Over there! Look! - Where?

610
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,040
What a strange dog!

611
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,480
We are here to look for my son. Not to look for your sons.

612
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,680
Yes, sir. - He shows me a dog! Now move it!

613
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,440
Have you seen this boy? He is my son.

614
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,280
No.

615
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,480
What did he tell you? - Help me up! - Sure.

616
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,560
Now, tell me, what did he say?

617
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,880
Had he told me, I wouldn't have crashed.

618
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,800
Come on, let's ask some other pole. - What?

619
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,160
Let's ask some other foreigner.

620
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,160
Yes, come on. Get up. - What a mess!

621
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Hey. Stop it. Come on.

622
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,280
Sir! Over there! Look!

623
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,680
What did you see? - If I said, you'd thrash me.

624
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,160
I'd thrash you more, if you don't! - You've taken to beating me!

625
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,240
I just saw your son over there. - You are..

626
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,560
I told you so! You're going to beat me up whether I tell it or I don't.

627
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,760
I won't. Now tell me where you saw him?

628
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,800
He entered the hotel over there. - Over there? - Yes.

629
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,800
Now he is also gone.

630
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,240
Is it?

631
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,920
Do you have only one servant in such a large house?

632
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,280
Not any more. - No more?

633
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,840
He ran away last week. - Did he?

634
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,400
Yes. - May I take up the job?

635
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,400
I'm not joking. I'll serve you well.

636
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,440
Why did you trip over me? - What were you doing down there?

637
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,400
We'll have the food some other time! Let's get out of here now!

638
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,760
What's wrong? - Let's get out of here, Meena.

639
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:19,640
Come on, let's move.

640
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,400
What is it? - Don't ask me anything.

641
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,760
Come on, let's move. Come on.

642
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,800
Where are you taking me?

643
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,320
He saw you and ran away with my niece!

644
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,320
To hell with your niece! My son ran away!

645
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,400
Is he your son? Oh, hello! I'm her aunt.

646
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,080
Is she your niece? - Yes.

647
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,520
Why did my son run away with your niece?

648
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,480
Why would a young man run away with a girl at the sight of his father?

649
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,760
What do you mean?

650
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,320
Do you want me to tell you why? Come along.

651
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,320
Come on, come with me. Follow me. Move it.

652
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,400
"You cannot love someone. Love just happens."

653
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,480
"Oh, my darling! Oh, my beloved!"

654
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,840
"You cannot love someone. Love just happens."

655
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:47,120
"Oh, my darling! Oh, my beloved!"

656
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:51,360
"I have heard it. - And so have you."

657
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,760
"This is what the people say."

658
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,000
"You cannot make mischief, it just happens."

659
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,120
"Oh, my darling! Oh, my beloved!"

660
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,480
"You cannot make mischief, it just happens."

661
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,760
"Oh, my darling! Oh, my beloved!"

662
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,000
"I have heard it. - And so have you."

663
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:21,480
"This is what the people say."

664
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,680
"You cannot love someone. Love just happens."

665
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,000
"Oh, my darling! Oh, my beloved!"

666
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,400
"You cannot make mischief, it just happens."

667
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,400
"Oh, my darling! Oh, my beloved!"

668
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:21,560
"The heart is never under your control."

669
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:25,560
"Or else, nobody would deliberately want to get crazy."

670
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:34,480
"The heart is never under your control."

671
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,680
"Or else, nobody would deliberately want to get crazy."

672
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:43,040
"The storm of love cannot be stopped no matter"

673
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:47,400
"how strongly the world opposes."

674
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,320
"No matter how strongly the world opposes."

675
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,560
"You cannot start a revolution. Revolutions just happen."

676
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,680
"Oh, my darling! Oh, my beloved!"

677
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,240
"You cannot make mischief, it just happens."

678
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,480
"Oh, my darling! Oh, my beloved!"

679
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,640
"I have heard it. - And so have you."

680
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,760
"This is what the people say."

681
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,920
"You cannot love someone. Love just happens."

682
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,920
"Oh, my darling! Oh, my beloved!"

683
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:04,400
"I could not sleep all night."

684
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,400
"I was changing sides all night."

685
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,280
"I could not sleep all night."

686
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,600
"I was changing sides all night."

687
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,840
"Your dreams had kept me awake."

688
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:30,320
"My every desire was very adamant."

689
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,160
"My every desire was very adamant."

690
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:38,480
"You cannot bring on such a condition, it just happens."

691
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,680
"Oh, my darling! Oh, my beloved!"

692
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:46,800
"You cannot love someone. Love just happens."

693
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:51,360
"Oh, my darling! Oh, my beloved!"

694
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,520
"I have heard it. - And so have you."

695
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
"This is what the people say."

696
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,280
"You cannot make mischief, it just happens."

697
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,480
"Oh, my darling! Oh, my beloved!"

698
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,600
"You cannot love someone. Love just happens."

699
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:20,120
"Oh, my darling! Oh, my beloved!"

700
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,680
Let's get out of here.

701
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,080
You are on the run. Are you trying to avoid someone? Who is it?

702
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,480
Never mind that, what a beautiful place this is!

703
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,280
Let's celebrate our honeymoon here after we get married!

704
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,120
Tell me, who is it? - My Dad.

705
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,240
Have you run away from Bombay?

706
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,480
Yes! I'm on the run from my father!

707
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,320
If he's here, you must see him. And you must also introduce me to him!

708
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,880
The day I do that, he'll start hatching plots to separate us!

709
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,880
And he will force me to marry just anyone he happens to like.

710
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,760
And he is so strict that he wants everything to be done on time.

711
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:51,760
So, what? - What if I don't wake you up at 7 o'clock?

712
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,120
What if I don't insist on breakfast at 8 o'clock?

713
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,480
What if it isn't office at 9 o'clock anymore?

714
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,880
Meena! Meena. - Greetings.

715
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,240
And what if I let you marry this girl?

716
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,240
Watch out, he's no sentimental fool!

717
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,040
He's a tough businessman. Watch your step!

718
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,320
Why don't you understand, Meena?

719
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,160
Run, Meena! Let's get out of here!

720
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,400
Go on! Run away! But my daughter-in-law stays with me!

721
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,880
Daughter-in-law? - Yes! This is my daughter-in-law!

722
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,040
You're going to cheat on me, Dad. You'll change your stand again!

723
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:23,480
Staying away from you has already changed me, son!

724
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,480
Just come closer to me. Come on!

725
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,240
Look at that, sir! It's a great restaurant!

726
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:39,040
Nice to have found my son, and a daughter-in-law, too.

727
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,040
Not your daughter-in-law yet. - But she will soon be.

728
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,160
Soon enough after I've talked to her parents. - Dad!

729
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,040
My parents are no more.

730
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,520
It's actually my dad, her grandpa, who takes all the decisions.

731
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,840
I'll meet him, in that case. - Grandpa is short-tempered.

732
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:57,000
My father's no less. And I still suspect him.

733
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,560
Both of them will be the same. There won't be a problem.

734
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,160
Take a look at that, sir! An Air India flight!

735
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,160
Hey!

736
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,480
I always knew she would end up like this.

737
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,800
And she'd show her true colours, once she went abroad!

738
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,600
That's exactly what she has done! She has brought us all to shame!

739
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:20,000
What's wrong with all of you? Why are you fanning the fire?

740
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,480
But, of course! We're her enemies, aren't we?

741
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,240
It's all because of your insistence, Dad! - Yes.

742
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,680
Had she not gone abroad, this would never have happened.

743
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,480
Good Lord! You folks are making mountain out of a molehill!

744
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,480
She has only fallen in love. And that's no sin!

745
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,240
Correct. - And I found him to be the decent sort.

746
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,120
They looked great together!

747
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:38,840
God save them from evil eye!

748
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,240
Besides, what's the harm if he marries her?

749
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,360
Just, shut up!

750
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,600
I'd sent you along, to keep an eye on her

751
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,320
and you come back with a love story!

752
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:53,600
Why did you go there? To study? Or to fall in love with this fellow?

753
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,480
Is this how you repay my love and indulgence?

754
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,800
Rajesh is a very decent boy, Grandpa.

755
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:05,000
Please agree to meet him. Just once.

756
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:09,240
I'll abide by any decision you take afterwards.

757
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:12,800
It's not the boys and girls who decide on marriages in our family.

758
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,240
I can always see him later.

759
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,920
Ask him to send his father over first.

760
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,160
Grandpa.

761
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,320
You're grooming me up as if I were the one getting married!

762
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,760
Meena's folks haven't met me yet, Dad.

763
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,560
They'd get an idea about me from the way you look.

764
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:28,840
It's just for your sake that I'm going over to their place.

765
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,400
Else, the mere mention of my name is enough to do the trick.

766
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,080
Please don't use that high and mighty tone out there, Dad!

767
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,320
Be polite and humble, please. - Why must I? No way!

768
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,480
I'm the groom's father!

769
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,160
Won't you be humble then? - No!

770
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,160
Very well then. This time you won't be able to find me!

771
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,760
I was just joking, and you.. What the heck! I won't go!

772
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,400
Look at the watch, Dad, you're already late!

773
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:48,680
Let the chauffeur come.

774
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,800
Will you lose status if you drive the car yourself?

775
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,640
The wedding won't be put off, if I'm a little late, will it?

776
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,840
Morning, sir. I'll drive the car for you! Give me the keys.

777
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,480
You will drive, is it? - Yes.

778
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,880
I'd rather hire an auto-rickshaw than let you drive me there.

779
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,120
I'll drive down on my own. And close your mouth.

780
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,240
Not today! Every time you laugh something goes wrong!

781
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,240
Don't laugh. Please! Not a smile, at all.

782
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,760
Hey, don't you have eyes!

783
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,400
Come back here!

784
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,480
Stop that car and get down!

785
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,840
Get down! Get down, I say!

786
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,400
What did you say? - What the hell is this?

787
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,280
Well, you called me a blind-bat, didn't you?

788
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,600
Yes, I did! - If you want to die

789
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,320
you can throw yourself under a train.

790
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,920
Why pick on my car? - Who else are you, if not blind?

791
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,520
Do you think you're a king, just because you are driving a car?

792
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,480
Can't you see people walking around?

793
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,360
There are pavements for pedestrians!

794
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,000
And there are zebra-crossings!

795
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,680
Why do you want to die under my car, like a piece of slime?

796
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,080
You called me a slime?

797
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,320
I've seen many tramps like you! Now get the hell out of here!

798
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,120
Did you call me a tramp? - Exactly!

799
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,240
Old bag of bones! He dares call me a tramp!

800
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,480
You're a tramp born in a family of tramps!

801
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,720
I could pick up a stone and wreck your car! Just get lost!

802
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:16,880
A little pushover, and you'd be dead many times over!

803
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,800
Look at you, old man! You're shaking like a leaf!

804
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,600
You're half dead, already. A blow from me and you'd be dead!

805
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,440
I'm on my way for an auspicious deed. So you're lucky to be alive.

806
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,840
Else I would have knocked your dentures out!

807
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,480
Whose denture.. - Poor sod can't even hold his stick.

808
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,880
Will somebody please help him? - Shut up, everyone!

809
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,520
Take him to a madhouse. - Get lost!

810
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,800
Chatterbox! Get out!

811
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:43,800
Stop!

812
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,920
I'll fix you later!

813
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,120
Hey, tramp! Don't come here to beg!

814
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,480
Get out! Get out!

815
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,880
Shut up! You father must have been a beggar!

816
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,480
Father! What's this? How did this happen?

817
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,160
Now don't you pick my brains! I'm in a rage!

818
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,080
Just pack your stuff and get out of here!

819
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,800
How did this happen? - The man and his car!

820
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,040
Sister-in-law, what happened?

821
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:14,240
Give these people a car and they'll drive like they fly planes!

822
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,600
And wayfarers are treated like flies!

823
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:22,040
Had I been carrying a gun, I would've shot him!

824
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,760
That's why I wanted to come along.

825
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,680
I would've bashed him up like a song!

826
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,800
Shut yourself up and sing yourself a song!

827
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:33,480
Please don't get angry anymore. And do give yourself a wash.

828
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,880
Could you perhaps recall the license number on the car?

829
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,840
Why only the number? His face is etched in my mind!

830
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,560
I'll blacken his face for sure!

831
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:47,480
I won't spare him! I won't! Even if I have to go against the law!

832
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,520
Could you tell me where Anand Nivas is?

833
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,480
Anand Nivas? Isn't that the madhouse?

834
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,720
Not that one. I'd like to go to Mr. Dinanath's residence.

835
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,240
That's him! He's the leader of the madmen who lives in there!

836
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:03,760
Why would you want to go to a madhouse?

837
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,240
Just tell me, will you?

838
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,640
Well it doesn't make a difference to me if you insist.

839
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,120
Go straight down and turn right and then take the left.

840
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,840
Then you'll come to a house where everyone seems to be screaming.

841
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:21,520
That's the madhouse. And do see me on your way back, will you?

842
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,080
Make sure you see me. - He sure sounds like a madman.

843
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,280
Greetings. - Greetings. I'm sorry to be late.

844
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,760
Welcome. We were waiting for you.

845
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,120
I'm Vidyanath. I teach in a college.

846
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,320
I'm Meena's Uncle.

847
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:40,480
This is my brother. - I'm Jeevan. Meena's Uncle.

848
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,760
Introduce me, too! - This is Rinku. He's a terror!

849
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,240
And what's your good name? - Greetings.

850
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,680
He's my uncle. He's a music director.

851
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,040
Nice meeting you. And would you be interested in making a film?

852
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:56,840
I don't watch movies. - That's strange!

853
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:00,840
What?

854
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,360
He's our father.

855
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,080
Him? - Yes.

856
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,040
Father!

857
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,440
Look, who's here!

858
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:19,720
He is Rajesh's father.

859
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,600
You! How dare you come right inside my house!

860
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,720
Shut the gates! He mustn't escape!

861
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,120
Father? - I won't spare him!

862
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,800
Fetch my gun! - Why are you enraged at seeing him?

863
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:37,720
He's the one in the car! He splashed muck all over me! My Gun!

864
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,720
Please listen to me! I didn't do it on purpose!

865
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,640
He didn't do it on purpose! - It was an accident.

866
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,560
Certainly not! I have made the mistake.

867
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,080
And now you come here to propose an alliance!

868
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,840
Please do away with your anger.

869
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,480
It happens all the time.

870
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,800
I didn't know that I was coming to you!

871
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:58,320
Please don't be angry. Let's discuss the alliance.

872
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:03,840
I shall never get into an alliance with your family! Never!

873
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:04,720
Just get out of here!

874
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,840
You're making a mountain out of a molehill!

875
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,480
You don't have broken bones. And you aren't dead, are you?

876
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,320
Were you also planning to kill me?

877
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,000
And you called me a filthy beggar!

878
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,320
But you were cursing me, too! - Not a word more! Just get out!

879
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:20,480
Father, please.. - Get out!

880
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,040
Please, Mr. Dinanath. I've apologised.

881
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,600
I'll hold your feet if you want.

882
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,480
Please don't ruin the lives of the young ones in a rage.

883
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,440
Let them marry.

884
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,360
I won't let your son marry my granddaughter

885
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,080
even if it means that she has to be a spinster all her life.

886
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:38,080
Now get out of here!

887
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:49,640
If we cross the streets ever again, I'll have a gun! Remember that!

888
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:54,080
I knew you would mess it up! - I didn't!

889
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,640
Could I have known that the old man would be Meena's grandpa?

890
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:01,000
Had I known, I would have licked him clean!

891
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,840
Be it anyone!

892
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,280
Why must you get into a fight with an old man?

893
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:11,560
I didn't. He cursed me. And I was the one who apologised!

894
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:12,720
Apologise? Did you? - Yes.

895
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,680
Really? - Ask Meena!

896
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,160
Did you really apologise?

897
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,440
Will you mind if I call Meena? - I don't mind at all.

898
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:24,440
Strange! My old man turns for the better. And the other goes haywire!

899
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:26,680
Hello!

900
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:28,360
Please give the line to Meena.

901
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,280
Who is this? - Rajesh speaking.

902
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:35,640
Whose call is it? - It's for Meena.

903
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,520
Who is it? - Rajesh speaking.

904
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,640
Before you can talk to Meena, you must talk to me! Speak up!

905
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,000
I would like to apologise for what has happened.

906
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:48,360
You may apologise and grovel. And you may

907
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:52,480
wash my soiled clothes for all I care!

908
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:53,760
I am really ashamed!

909
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,800
Live in shame all your life! And don't you ever call again!

910
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:00,080
Hang up the phone! - Give it to me.

911
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,480
Keep a pail of muck at home.

912
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,680
If you ever see the father or the son, douse them in the muck!

913
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,360
As if one problem wasn't enough!

914
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,160
Don't you blame me.

915
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:13,720
Not at all. In fact, I was praising him.

916
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,160
Oh, God!

917
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:18,640
Nothing.

918
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,240
Oh, it's nothing at all.

919
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:26,720
Please wash my clothes. - And mine, too.

920
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:31,240
But I'm going to college, now. - College? What college?

921
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:35,080
But you've graduated, already. - Do you want to join the government?

922
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:41,680
It's time you do the household chores. You'd be a good housewife.

923
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:47,160
Grandpa! I want to study! Please let me go to college!

924
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,160
What would he say?

925
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:53,720
We aren't enemies. We don't wish you any harm.

926
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,800
We had advised against college earlier. But you went abroad.

927
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,000
And what a romance you had!

928
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,360
College is just an excuse.

929
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:03,800
She must be going to meet that boy.

930
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,080
Now, she can't meet that fellow when she is at home.

931
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,720
Please don't discontinue my studies.

932
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:09,640
Please let me go to college.

933
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,760
There's no need. They are right.

934
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,480
You don't need any further education. Just stay at home.

935
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,280
Go inside.

936
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,600
Now don't go to your room and weep. There's a lot of work left to do.

937
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:29,840
My legs are aching. - And I'm not feeling well. Let's go.

938
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,480
Grandpa!

939
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,480
Don't shout. What is it?

940
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,120
I've a news! You'll be delighted to hear it!

941
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,320
What's so great? Have you brought a servant for me?

942
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,320
Yes! I've brought a servant!

943
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:45,240
Really? How good is he? And what's he asking for wages?

944
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,560
He was on the street asking for work.

945
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,320
I brought him over. But I didn't discuss money.

946
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:56,240
Well done! Now tell everyone! He's a godsend for everyone!

947
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,160
Mom! Dad! Uncle! Aunt! Hurry up! A servant is here!

948
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,600
A servant? - Where is he?

949
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,640
Over there. - I can't believe my ears!

950
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:08,400
What's your name?

951
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,640
Raju! My name is Raju.

952
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,320
Where did you work before this?

953
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,840
At Mr. Amit's place. - Who's that?

954
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:19,600
Mr. Amitabh Bachchan. - Is it? - Mr 'Big B'!

955
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:20,880
Who put you on the job there?

956
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,160
No one in particular. I served him tea at Sridevi's place.

957
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,760
He offered me a Rs. 100 raise

958
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:29,600
and asked me to work for him. And off I went.

959
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:30,480
How selfish!

960
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,360
And who introduced you to Sridevi? - Salman did.

961
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,040
He knows Salman, too! - Yes. He happened to see me once

962
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:37,840
when I was with Dharmendra. And I was in tears.

963
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:39,840
Salman asked me why was I crying.

964
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:43,720
I said that I had to cook almost as much as you'd have to feed an army.

965
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,800
If I served burnt bread, the father and his macho sons would thrash me.

966
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,640
They go wild, once they lose their heads. Else, they are kind hearted.

967
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,680
Who introduced you to Dharmendra? - Akshay Kumar did.

968
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,880
And who introduced you to him? - An actress. But I can't tell you

969
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:56,840
who she is. - But you must!

970
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:02,320
Though there isn't much of a need for a reference

971
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,560
do you have anyone who can give a good reference?

972
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:06,400
I can't give any references. - I see.

973
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,160
Employ me if you want to. - Sure.

974
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,480
Anyway, I have an open offer from Madhuri Dixit.

975
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,640
Oh, no! - Don't do that! - I know him. - I have the offer.

976
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:17,160
I know him.

977
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,680
How could she know him?

978
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,480
Aren't you the one who used to work for Mr. Subhash?

979
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,280
Which Mr. Subhash? - Subhash Ghai.

980
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,760
He used to live near my in-laws. You did the cleaning in his house.

981
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,400
Oh! Mr. Subhash Ghai! Of course!

982
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:36,160
Remember? - And I remember seeing you around.

983
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:40,400
Why did you leave that job? - He axed me after a film flopped.

984
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,560
Never mind that. Now tell me where the kitchen is.

985
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,480
There!

986
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,920
Milk for me. Not tea. - Whom is the tea for?

987
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,440
Tea for everyone else. - Name them. Where do they stay?

988
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:52,320
Uncle and aunt in the room on the left, upstairs.

989
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,440
My room is on the right. Mom and Dad share my room with me.

990
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:56,280
I see!

991
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:59,240
Grandpa lives in the room down there. Uncle Pappi lives there.

992
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:02,280
I see. And who else lives here?

993
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:03,880
Shanno lives here, nowadays.

994
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,760
Who else is here? - Dimple.

995
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,880
Who else? - And yes, Meena.

996
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,720
And where is she, nowadays?

997
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,280
She stays in her room and weeps. - Does she now?

998
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,440
Now that I am here, she won't cry. Where is her room?

999
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:22,360
Up there. - Now don't you bore me anymore. Else I'll quit. Get lost.

1000
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,800
How about a cup of strong tea?

1001
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,720
I don't want any. Go away. - What's this I hear?

1002
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:33,760
I hear that you are crying your heart out these days.

1003
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:38,320
Must you spill those million-dollar tears for a cheap photograph?

1004
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:43,760
Forget that photograph. I'm at your service, ma'am! Let's embrace!

1005
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,560
You scoundrel!

1006
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:50,640
How do you like what you see? How about my suggestion?

1007
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:54,640
Raj! You! You're here!

1008
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:49,400
"I was walking and she was riding a bicycle."

1009
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:53,040
"I was walking and she was riding a bicycle."

1010
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:56,520
"She rung the bell and disgraced me."

1011
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:03,560
"She rung the bell and disgraced me."

1012
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:07,120
"I was riding a bicycle and she was riding a horse-carriage."

1013
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:10,680
"She rung the bell and disgraced me."

1014
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:15,480
"She rung the bell and disgraced me."

1015
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,640
"What are you saying?"

1016
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:24,560
"I was travelling by a car and he was in an auto-rickshaw."

1017
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:28,440
"I was travelling by a car and he was in an auto-rickshaw."

1018
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:31,800
"He blew the horn and disgraced me."

1019
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:39,040
"He blew the horn and disgraced me."

1020
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:42,520
"I was travelling by plane and he was in a car."

1021
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,080
"He blew the horn and disgraced me."

1022
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:50,080
"He blew the horn and disgraced me."

1023
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:25,440
"People have seen this act of teasing."

1024
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:34,320
"My youth was dishonoured on the streets."

1025
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,840
"You fool, why are you arguing with me?"

1026
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:44,360
"Why don't you read the tale of my heart?"

1027
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:48,640
"I was passing through a lane and she was standing at her window."

1028
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,280
"My darling!"

1029
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:55,000
"I was passing through a lane and she was standing at her window."

1030
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:58,480
"She whistled at me and disgraced me."

1031
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,480
"She whistled at me and disgraced me."

1032
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,280
"He catches me on the street and stops me in the lanes."

1033
01:08:52,760 --> 01:09:00,640
"He is stubbornly chasing me."

1034
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:11,120
"I am a crazy lover, don't deceive me in love."

1035
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:15,720
"I was going shopping and he was coming down the stairs."

1036
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:18,280
"Do you understand?"

1037
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:21,760
"I was going shopping and he was coming down the stairs."

1038
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:25,400
"He caught hold of my hands and disgraced me."

1039
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:29,160
"He caught hold of my hands and disgraced me."

1040
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:33,040
"I was walking and she was riding a bicycle."

1041
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:35,800
"Hey, where are you going?"

1042
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:39,480
"I was walking and she was riding a bicycle."

1043
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
"She rung the bell and disgraced me."

1044
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:46,640
"She rung the bell and disgraced me."

1045
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:53,640
"I was travelling by a car and he was in an auto-rickshaw."

1046
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:57,160
"I was travelling by a car and he was in an auto-rickshaw."

1047
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:00,720
"He blew the horn and disgraced me."

1048
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:05,480
"He blew the horn and disgraced me."

1049
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,680
"Hey darling, you have sliced my heart"

1050
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,160
"and applied butter to it."

1051
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:21,440
"He is desperately chasing me."

1052
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,120
Get apart! Now is that what you've come here for?

1053
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:26,120
No. I'm here for the tea. The rest just happened.

1054
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,920
I see! - Why are you posing as a servant?

1055
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,360
Kings have abdicated thrones for the sake of love.

1056
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,720
I merely walked away from a comfortable life.

1057
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:36,240
By the way, I know

1058
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,120
it's easier playing the Romeo

1059
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:42,800
than doing household chores.

1060
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:47,640
Raj! - Words won't cook lunch. How are you going to cook?

1061
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:52,320
I'll do it. And I'll keep everyone pleased.

1062
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:57,480
Vegetarian delights! Non-vegetarian delicacies! And Chinese dishes!

1063
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,400
Raju's culinary skills! It's all spread out on this table!

1064
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,280
Serve us upstairs.

1065
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:08,320
And we'd like to eat in our room, too.

1066
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,040
I don't understand why people here

1067
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,360
can't sit down to supper together.

1068
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,920
We are more at ease eating in our rooms.

1069
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,880
I don't want to work in such a household!

1070
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,000
Raju! Don't leave! - We're coming!

1071
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:21,920
Now you'll have to sit at the table.

1072
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,120
Useless people! Come, sit down.

1073
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:31,000
You've cooked all this with such care. How could we refuse you?

1074
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,520
Do sit down. - Yes. Let's sit.

1075
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,920
"Please serve me some food quickly."

1076
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:40,760
"I have not eaten food since yesterday."

1077
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,920
"I am hungry! I am hungry! I am hungry!"

1078
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:49,360
"Eat your meal, you will be revitalised."

1079
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:54,360
"Your hunger will disappear."

1080
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:59,360
"Eat your meal, you will be revitalised."

1081
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:04,840
"Your hunger will disappear."

1082
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:08,720
My wife fooled me.

1083
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:13,760
She gave me three sons. But none are as good as you are.

1084
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,640
God bless you. May you live long.

1085
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,600
I'll take it. You must relax now.

1086
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,760
The phone keeps ringing in this house all day.

1087
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:26,680
Hello! - Raj! It's I..

1088
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:27,840
Hello, Uncle! - Uncle, is it?

1089
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:29,800
No sooner than he steps into his in-law's house!

1090
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,480
Yes. I see. Right.

1091
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:33,480
Is the old fool somewhere nearby?

1092
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,600
Absolutely. - And what are you doing?

1093
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:37,600
Massaging his feet.

1094
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,600
Forget his legs. Get the neck! Strangle him!

1095
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,160
I know how to work on him.

1096
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:44,360
He's asking me to give you a good massage.

1097
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:46,320
Yes. - What does your uncle do?

1098
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,000
Hang on. - What does he do? - He's a guard.

1099
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:49,800
A guard. Oh, yes, with the increasing thefts nowadays..

1100
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,480
I see. No, that doesn't happen when he's around.

1101
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,240
Ask him to be on his guard during the daytime, too.

1102
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:58,800
During the day.. - Now hold on a minute, Uncle.

1103
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:01,080
He isn't active anymore. Two people work for him, now.

1104
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,320
I see! - Those fellows stand in for him.

1105
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,760
Hello! - All right. Yes.

1106
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:06,760
How is my daughter-in-law?

1107
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,040
Fine. - How old is he?

1108
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,160
I'm putting in love's labour.

1109
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,920
Near the age of senility.

1110
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:17,160
I'm regaled at the fact that you laugh at others who are senile!

1111
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,320
Hold on a minute. Yes, tell me.

1112
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:23,400
I haven't seen you in some time. I'd love to meet you.

1113
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:26,000
Same here.

1114
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,440
Bye, son. Take care.

1115
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,640
Sure. And you must take care of your health.

1116
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:34,880
Bye. - All right.

1117
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,440
There rings another bell.

1118
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,280
Must be the princess.

1119
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,840
And she lives in her own house just like a paying guest!

1120
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,480
Open the door for her. - I will.

1121
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,920
Should I lay it out for her? - Go ahead.

1122
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:53,440
Welcome. Can I tell you something? - Go ahead.

1123
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:57,520
It isn't good for a girl to come home so late at night.

1124
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,120
How dare you?

1125
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:04,440
Who are you to ask me that?

1126
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:08,000
Not even my parents have ever said that to me.

1127
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:12,000
You're just a servant. Just stay within your limits.

1128
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:20,720
She is too much!

1129
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:25,280
"Take some wonderful and sweet.." Oh, no!

1130
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:27,280
Are you getting stuck?

1131
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:31,080
Yes. - May I help you out?

1132
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,160
What do you know about music?

1133
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:44,240
"I have worked with Kishore Kumar for two years."

1134
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,440
"Really? - Yes."

1135
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:50,720
I have to score a duet. But I can't get a tune.

1136
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:54,920
Is it a romantic song? - A duet has to be romantic.

1137
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:58,560
Kishore Kumar used to score romantic songs sitting with girls.

1138
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,720
We do have a girl in this house.

1139
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:02,480
Who is it? - Meena!

1140
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,480
Miss Meena, do you mean? - Oh yes. Meena!

1141
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:06,160
Yes.

1142
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:08,040
Well, she'll do. - Okay.

1143
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,880
Take the percussion. I'll play the tune.

1144
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:14,360
Very well.

1145
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,480
Sit down on the floor. Pay obeisances

1146
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,120
to the instrument before you begin. - Greetings!

1147
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,360
Come down, quickly!

1148
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,080
Come on. Sit down.

1149
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:26,440
Uncle Pappi, what is the matter?

1150
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:29,760
Listen carefully. It's a situation where something is announced.

1151
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:33,520
You love me and I love you! - Oh, no!

1152
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,280
Try to understand. And my father is the villain of the piece.

1153
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,360
He's standing in your way. That's the situation.

1154
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:45,480
The funny fact is the poor uncle hasn't an idea of what's going on.

1155
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,360
The poor fellow is even playing second fiddle to us. Isn't that so?

1156
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:50,680
You describe it well.

1157
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:51,800
Shall we start? - Yes.

1158
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:55,800
This family is too much!

1159
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:30,000
"You love me and I love you."

1160
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:35,240
"You love me and I love you."

1161
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:40,320
"I proclaim my love for you."

1162
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:45,440
"You love me and I love you."

1163
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:49,440
"You love me and I love you."

1164
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:05,880
"You love me and I love you."

1165
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:11,040
"You love me and I love you."

1166
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:16,120
"I proclaim my love for you."

1167
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:21,280
"You love me and I love you."

1168
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:25,280
"You love me and I love you."

1169
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:02,240
"I have been restless for your love."

1170
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:06,240
"Only I know what I am going through."

1171
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:17,560
"I have been restless for your love."

1172
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:22,600
"Only I know what I am going through."

1173
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:27,760
"You heave a sigh in secret and so do I."

1174
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:32,840
"You heave a sigh in secret and so do I."

1175
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:38,000
"I proclaim my love for you."

1176
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:43,120
"You love me and I love you."

1177
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:47,120
"You love me and I love you."

1178
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:29,240
"Now, I am not afraid and neither is there any trouble."

1179
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:33,240
"It is God's kindness you are sitting in front of me."

1180
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:44,560
"Now, I am not afraid and neither is there any trouble."

1181
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:49,440
"It is God's kindness you are sitting in front of me."

1182
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:54,640
"Neither are you afraid nor am I."

1183
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:59,840
"Neither are you afraid nor am I."

1184
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:04,800
"I proclaim my love for you."

1185
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:10,040
"You love me and I love you."

1186
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:15,240
"You love me and I love you."

1187
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:20,400
"I proclaim my love for you."

1188
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:25,440
"You love me and I love you."

1189
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,440
"You love me and I love you."

1190
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:44,240
"I was decorating the eggplants."

1191
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:46,240
How much? - Rs. 100.

1192
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:47,480
What? - Rs. 100.

1193
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Rs. 100? It is pretty cheap.

1194
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:53,040
Aren't you the one who is working in Mr. Dinanath's house?

1195
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:54,600
Yes. And greetings to you.

1196
01:20:55,080 --> 01:21:01,480
You should rather kill yourself under the bus on the street.

1197
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,640
What nonsense! Why should I die? You should rather kill yourself!

1198
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:09,000
You won't understand this, yet. I used to work there, you see.

1199
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:13,240
I lost half my weight working for them.

1200
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:16,040
You should be ashamed of yourself for saying such things against him.

1201
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,600
You should be grateful to the ones who fed you.

1202
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:22,800
Sure! All they fed me were crumbs.

1203
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:27,080
And now I'm as thin as a reed!

1204
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:32,160
They'd suck a man dry!

1205
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:34,360
May they be struck down by..

1206
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:38,360
An aircraft, do you mean? - Oh yes! May them be bombed!

1207
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:42,280
And the plague be upon them. May they die like rats!

1208
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:43,680
Are you cursing them? - Yes!

1209
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:45,280
You're hitting me!

1210
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:48,120
Another word against Mr. Dinanath or his family, and I'll thrash you.

1211
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:49,800
How many more people are you going to bash up?

1212
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,480
Saw what I did to him? And who might you be?

1213
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,480
Even I happen to be related to that family.

1214
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:55,160
How come?

1215
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:57,920
I'm Shanno's husband. - Is it?

1216
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:02,040
Hear that? - Clear off.

1217
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:05,280
I am Sunil. - I see.

1218
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:09,160
So you are the one for whom Shanno is pining away!

1219
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:11,640
Not at all. She'd rather be waiting for me to kick the bucket!

1220
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,680
Not at all. And you're insulting her feelings for you.

1221
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:14,880
Nonsense!

1222
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:17,760
She isn't likely to shed even a tear after I'm dead and gone.

1223
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:21,720
That isn't true. At times, she is so sad that she won't even eat!

1224
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:23,480
But I'm a mere servant. I shouldn't be saying all this.

1225
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,600
Just a minute, mister. - What's it?

1226
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,760
Is that true? Does she still love me?

1227
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:31,360
I really think that you should take her away.

1228
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,120
What did you say your name is? - I'm Raju.

1229
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:36,680
I've sworn not to enter that house ever again.

1230
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:39,560
You needn't. I'll bring her out for you. And you can take her away.

1231
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:42,440
Would that be okay? - According to me, it is.

1232
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:43,720
Ms. Shanno, good afternoon. - Good afternoon.

1233
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:45,640
I happened to meet Mr. Sunil today.

1234
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:47,480
Which Sunil? - Mr. Sunil, your husband.

1235
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,440
Don't even remind me of him! - But he wept for you.

1236
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:52,520
Is it? No, he wouldn't give a damn even if I died!

1237
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,920
How could you say such a thing? He has been pining away for you.

1238
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:57,240
Is that so? Now tell me, how do you happen to know him?

1239
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:59,000
That last servant in here.. What was his name? - Babu.

1240
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:01,720
Yes, Babu. This fellow was criticising you.

1241
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:05,560
And Mr. Sunil accosted him for speaking ill of you.

1242
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,840
I can't believe that! Are you lying to me?

1243
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:10,120
Why am I saying all this? - Oh, no! Wait a minute!

1244
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:13,320
I know that you'd never tell a lie! What else did he say?

1245
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:14,640
Who said what? - Sunil!

1246
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,120
Sunil, the poor fellow!

1247
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:19,880
When he heard me say that I work in here

1248
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:24,840
he wept his heart out.

1249
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,160
He was inconsolable.

1250
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:31,440
He asked me how you've been keeping.

1251
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,560
If he's pining away for me, why doesn't he take me away from here?

1252
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:38,480
But he has sworn it by you, not to step inside this house.

1253
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,440
Can't he meet me some place outside this house? Can't he take me home?

1254
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:42,120
That's it!

1255
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:45,920
That's just why he has asked you to meet him in Juhu today.

1256
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:48,880
I'd rather say that you patched it up, right away.

1257
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:52,880
Hail Maharashtra!

1258
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,480
Shanno?

1259
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,280
It's been a few days without me. You are already toeing the line.

1260
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:02,680
You fought before leaving me.

1261
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:05,760
You sounded as if you'd never see me again.

1262
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:09,440
And you've already started pining away for me!

1263
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:14,520
Was it me who was pining? Didn't you call me here to take me home?

1264
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,360
Did I call you here? Oh, no! You did!

1265
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:17,320
You called me! - You did!

1266
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,080
Quiet! For God's sake!

1267
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,320
It's just as well that you came by. Tell us, who called whom over here.

1268
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,680
Why spoil the fun over such trivial issue?

1269
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:27,480
You lied to me!

1270
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,680
A lie which helps build a home isn't a lie, at all!

1271
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:34,000
Must I take lessons from a lowly servant?

1272
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:35,840
Don't you dare call him a servant!

1273
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:37,080
Did that hurt, dear? - No. You go on.

1274
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:38,480
Do you know who he is? - Who?

1275
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,520
He's Rajesh, the only son of Mr. Dhanraj, the business tycoon.

1276
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,320
Greetings. - Greetings.

1277
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,320
Meena and Rajesh are in love. - Greetings.

1278
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,560
But Daddy won't concede to it. - Greetings.

1279
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:50,400
He's posing as a servant in the household to win over my father.

1280
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:51,240
Greetings!

1281
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,040
You've helped me see things in a new light, my friend. - How come?

1282
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:56,640
If a millionaire can work as a servant for the sake of love

1283
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:00,040
why can't I help my wife with household chores for her love?

1284
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:00,920
Right! - Now listen.

1285
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:05,680
Tell that old fool that my wife isn't going back there ever again!

1286
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,080
Shanno, let's go! - Wait a moment, Mr. Sunil.

1287
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:07,760
What's it?

1288
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:10,800
Here's a present from me. Cook it yourselves. And share it with love.

1289
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:13,680
Goodbye. - Best of luck, Raju. Very sweet boy!

1290
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:17,040
She's through. But where does that leave me?

1291
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:21,640
Your uncle is here. - Uncle? Did I ever have one?

1292
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:26,760
He's with Grandpa. Go and see him. - With grandpa? Really?

1293
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:30,760
Here comes Raju. Your uncle is here.

1294
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:35,760
How are you doing, dear? - Hello, Uncle!

1295
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:38,520
How are you my child? - Uncle!

1296
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,560
You are grey all over! Have you been using a detergent in the bath?

1297
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:45,600
No. I missed you so much that I've greyed all over.

1298
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:49,240
Your nephew is perfect at work. He has won everyone's hearts.

1299
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:51,800
That's why he is here to win over hearts.

1300
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:55,480
What do you mean? - It's a servant's duty

1301
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,400
to win his master's heart. - He's the hero in this house.

1302
01:25:58,880 --> 01:25:59,800
He's the hero everywhere. - Grandpa!

1303
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:03,640
May I go out with my uncle? - Sure, go ahead.

1304
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:04,800
Come along, Uncle. - Greetings.

1305
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:07,280
Come on, give this to me. Just give it to me.

1306
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:08,400
Oh, my God!

1307
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,440
It's been so long since I ate food cooked by someone else.

1308
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:12,040
I've forgotten this way of life.

1309
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:14,440
I haven't yet savoured your cooking. - Yes.

1310
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,440
Where do you think you're going? - Inside.

1311
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:20,080
For supper, you see. - Try the kiosks on the pavement.

1312
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:23,760
A case of mistaken identity. This man here is Mr. Dhanraj.

1313
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:27,800
The name is of no consequence unless the man doesn't have cash.

1314
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:28,840
Now, get lost.

1315
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:32,720
You look tough. But I can thrash you.

1316
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:36,560
And I can retaliate. - Let me show you how to!

1317
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,600
To hell with you! - No fighting!

1318
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:42,040
He's talking nonsense! - Don't argue with him.

1319
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,080
He's a teacher.

1320
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:49,040
He just taught us that people are respected for their wealth.

1321
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:53,160
Tell me, how long is this play-acting going to go on?

1322
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:58,640
I hate every moment of this, Dad.

1323
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:02,400
Leave me! Help! - That's Dimple!

1324
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,320
Let go! Help!

1325
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,280
Let me go! Who are you all?

1326
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:08,920
Let me go! Help!

1327
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:11,520
Wait here. I'll be back.

1328
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,520
Let me go! Help me!

1329
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:23,280
Raju!

1330
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:24,880
Let me go!

1331
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:27,440
Mister, where are you going?

1332
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:29,400
Let me go!

1333
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:34,600
Stop! Where are you taking her? Please let her go.

1334
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:36,520
Get lost!

1335
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,600
Oh, no! I won't! And remember that Gandhiji had denounced violence.

1336
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:43,720
He also asked you to offer your right cheek to anyone

1337
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:45,560
who strikes you on the left. Remember that?

1338
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:47,320
Yes, you are right.

1339
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:53,880
If you let the girl go, I'll offer my right cheek.

1340
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:57,280
Now lay off and relax.

1341
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:02,680
How could I? It was Nehru who said that to relax is a waste.

1342
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:05,040
Looks like we might have to fix this fellow.

1343
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:07,160
Do you know what Shakespeare said?

1344
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:10,480
A woman is like the fragrance of a flower.

1345
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,920
She may never be forced.

1346
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:15,680
A difference of preferences, you see.

1347
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:20,400
You love fragrances. We prefer force.

1348
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,480
Enough is enough.

1349
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,480
Let me tell you what another great man had once said.

1350
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,640
Know what Subhash Chandra Bose said?

1351
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:35,440
Subhash Chandra Bose said, 'Give me blood. And I'll give you freedom.'

1352
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:37,400
That's what I'm telling you.

1353
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:41,400
Give me blood. And I shall give you freedom!

1354
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:44,840
What are you up to?

1355
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:47,480
Please forgive me!

1356
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:54,440
Better late than never. But never so late at night!

1357
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:56,840
I am sorry. - You must be.

1358
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:00,080
Is it you? - Yes.

1359
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,560
But no one at home must know.

1360
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:07,320
Okay? Now come on follow me.

1361
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:11,440
What are you doing in the kitchen? - I've made breakfast for grandpa.

1362
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:13,120
Well done!

1363
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:16,280
Raju! Where's my breakfast? - Coming up!

1364
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:18,080
Go on. - Why don't you serve him?

1365
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:22,080
I? - Oh, yes! Go on!

1366
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:28,520
Grandpa, here's breakfast.

1367
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,320
How come you've got me breakfast? - I made it myself, grandpa.

1368
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,320
What are you saying?

1369
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:38,320
I'm so happy to know that!

1370
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:44,600
I'm glad!

1371
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:49,400
Is Raju a policeman? He has straightened out everyone!

1372
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:50,320
I just don't understand.

1373
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:51,880
Swing your arms while you walk. - How?

1374
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:55,160
This way. Swing your arms. It'll strengthen your heart.

1375
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:56,920
Long strides refresh the brain.

1376
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:02,480
The arms are okay. My legs ache so! - I'll massage your legs.

1377
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,680
Swing the arms for a healthy heart. Long strides to refresh the brain.

1378
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:08,880
I see. - Walking revitalises the system.

1379
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:11,880
How do we handle Kapoor and Kapoor? - Forget it.

1380
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,920
Kapoor, is out of the list.

1381
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:16,280
Kapoor is away.

1382
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:17,600
What about Sharma and Sharma?

1383
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:19,720
That's a nice way to walk it out.

1384
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:22,120
He is a shameless fellow! - Sir, that..

1385
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:25,360
Shut up.

1386
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,560
Catch him!

1387
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:29,320
Not me. Catch that old man! - Whom?

1388
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:30,880
Him! He's the one who doused me in muck! Catch him!

1389
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:32,920
You old fogey!

1390
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:35,480
Can you get hold of a dog from someone?

1391
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,880
What for? - To turn the dog loose on him!

1392
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:42,560
Why worry? I'm your dog! Just shoo me on.

1393
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:44,760
Shoo! Raju! - Just see how I bite him!

1394
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,160
Watch your tongue! Else..

1395
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:49,520
You are my father!

1396
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,080
I mean to say that he is old as my father.

1397
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,440
He's a sinner! Kill him!

1398
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:56,680
What did you say? I'll rip you apart!

1399
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:58,880
You are speaking quite disrespectfully with him.

1400
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:01,440
No respects to a scavenger! Just bash him up!

1401
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,720
Do you expect my son to bash me up?

1402
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:05,760
What? - Meaning that he's just old enough to be my son.

1403
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:07,640
Take me on! I'll smash your nose! - Don't!

1404
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:11,480
I'm tying to patch things up! And you insist on fighting it out!

1405
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,480
What? - I mean to say that..

1406
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,680
If you don't scram till I count.. - Get lost!

1407
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:19,360
...If you don't go away, I will!

1408
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,800
I'll count till 3. One! - One!

1409
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:22,480
One.

1410
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:23,880
Two! - Two!

1411
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:25,440
Two-and-a-quarter! - Two-fifteen! - Sir!

1412
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:26,520
What the hell? - Let's get out of here!

1413
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,680
Have you gone out of your mind? - He might run away!

1414
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:30,280
Two-and-a-half! - Two-thirty!

1415
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:32,640
All right! I'm leaving! But I'll fix you sometime!

1416
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:35,080
Two-and-three-quarters! - A quarter-to-three!

1417
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:39,120
He ran off at a quarter-to-three! That was a good lesson!

1418
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:43,560
A quarter-to-three!

1419
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:45,720
Men will do anything for love!

1420
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:49,240
But none has ever bitten his father like a dog for the sake of love.

1421
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:51,600
Shame on me!

1422
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:55,800
"Meena, look what your love has made me."

1423
01:32:56,320 --> 01:33:00,680
"Sometimes, I am a dog and other times, I am a cheat."

1424
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:04,680
I love you, Meena.

1425
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:18,880
"I have run away with you from your house."

1426
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:23,120
"I have run away with you from your house."

1427
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:27,080
"Because I fear your dad. I fear your dad."

1428
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:31,520
"Because I fear your dad. I fear your dad."

1429
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,600
"I will take you away from everybody's evil eyes."

1430
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:39,520
"I will take you away from everybody's evil eyes."

1431
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,400
"Because I fear your dad. I fear your dad."

1432
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:47,760
"Because I fear your dad. I fear your dad."

1433
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:51,680
"I have run away with you from my house."

1434
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:56,000
"I have run away with you from my house."

1435
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:59,920
"Because I fear my dad. I fear my dad."

1436
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:04,280
"Because I fear my dad. I fear my dad."

1437
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:08,480
"I will take you away from everybody's evil eyes."

1438
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,400
"I will take you away from everybody's evil eyes."

1439
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:16,320
"Because I fear my dad. I fear my dad."

1440
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:20,320
"Because I fear my dad. I fear my dad."

1441
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:57,720
"He is cruel. He is an oppressor. He is an enemy of love."

1442
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:05,720
"He will never allow you to become my bride."

1443
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:10,120
"He is cruel. He is an oppressor. He is an enemy of love."

1444
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:14,240
"He will never allow me to become your bride."

1445
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:18,160
"We will get married far away from the city."

1446
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:22,120
"We will get married far away from the city."

1447
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:26,160
"Because I fear my dad. I fear my dad."

1448
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:30,160
"Because I fear your dad. I fear your dad."

1449
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:15,800
"He will take me away and lock me in a room."

1450
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:23,840
"He will not like if we meet."

1451
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:28,240
"He will take me away and lock me in a room."

1452
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:32,360
"He will not like if we meet."

1453
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:36,440
"My heart starts to beat faster just hearing such a thing."

1454
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:40,400
"My heart starts to beat faster just hearing such a thing."

1455
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:44,440
"Because I fear your dad. I fear your dad."

1456
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:48,600
"Because I fear my dad. I fear my dad."

1457
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:52,800
"I have run away with you from your house."

1458
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:56,760
"I have run away with you from my house."

1459
01:37:57,280 --> 01:38:00,720
"Because I fear your dad. I fear your dad."

1460
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:04,720
"Because I fear my dad. I fear my dad."

1461
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:25,560
Raju, get up. - Who is that?

1462
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:30,480
Get up! - Who is it?

1463
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,360
Beg your pardon, ma'am! I just fell asleep.

1464
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:37,040
Now get out of that sleep and get this house in order.

1465
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:38,800
Cook a sumptuous meal.

1466
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:44,320
People are coming to see Meena for a marriage alliance.

1467
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:47,120
Oh, no! Everyday there is a new problem!

1468
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:50,520
Meena might have lost her parents.

1469
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,480
But we saw to it that she never missed them.

1470
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,160
Yes. - It's true.

1471
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:58,240
I love Meena more than I love Dimple.

1472
01:38:58,720 --> 01:38:59,720
I say, if Meena goes away from this house

1473
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:01,280
then this house will lose its sheen.

1474
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,480
I say that my niece is so talented

1475
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:09,440
it's as if God created her using the finest of melodies!

1476
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:10,480
And about that, I'm not joking!

1477
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,800
Words aren't enough to praise the lady.

1478
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:16,440
She's God-fearing, the incarnation of the Goddess of Fortune!

1479
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:20,280
She'll surely light up lives in the family she will enter.

1480
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:22,280
Please help yourselves.

1481
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:24,720
First the parents and then the son.

1482
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:27,680
Please have it. - Yes.

1483
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:31,160
Thank you. - The Samosas are delicious!

1484
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:34,440
Meena must have made these. - No. Raju has made those.

1485
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:35,400
Really? - Yes.

1486
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:38,720
Please have some, ma'am. - You cook very well.

1487
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:41,040
I'm quite good at concoctions. - Paro.

1488
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:42,320
Ask Meena to serve the tea.

1489
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:44,520
Why must Ms. Meena serve tea? I'll fetch it.

1490
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:49,120
Excuse me. Excuse me, please.

1491
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:50,440
Give it to me.

1492
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:52,280
What are you doing? Meena will serve the tea.

1493
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:53,720
Why trouble her? I'll serve it.

1494
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,920
What a fool! Don't you understand?

1495
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:58,040
What? - Try to understand, Raju.

1496
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:01,160
Serve the tea. - All right.

1497
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:03,680
You're looking gorgeous!

1498
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:06,320
Listen.

1499
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:07,480
Go on.

1500
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,920
Listen.

1501
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:11,880
Go on.

1502
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:15,120
Listen, serve it with a smile.

1503
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:18,360
We like her. And we don't want any dowry.

1504
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:21,760
But we would like to have your servant Raju as a wedding gift.

1505
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:26,920
You may have any or all of my 3 sons. And I won't regret it.

1506
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:28,480
But not Raju.

1507
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:32,600
But father.. - No way!

1508
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:35,840
Oh, no! What have you done? - It's okay. It's okay.

1509
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:38,520
Forgive me! - Never mind. The colour looks nice, too!

1510
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Take him to the wash basin. - Yes. Please come.

1511
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:45,000
I'll treat you to tea later. The tea spilled.

1512
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:49,000
Please come.

1513
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:53,440
I'd like to tell you something. - Go on.

1514
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:58,360
I am in love with someone.

1515
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:03,000
He loves me dearly.

1516
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:07,400
He's going through many hardships for my sake.

1517
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:10,800
If he can't marry me, he will die!

1518
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:15,480
If I can't marry him, I'll die!

1519
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,680
For God's sake, please refuse to marry me!

1520
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:21,440
Please!

1521
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:25,480
Okay. Okay.

1522
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,800
I liked you.

1523
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:33,680
But, the way you spoke has touched my heart.

1524
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:39,680
And I'm sure that the man you want is a worthy one.

1525
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:43,160
Smile. Smile please.

1526
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:47,160
Greetings.

1527
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:54,280
Worthy, I am!

1528
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:57,160
I'm late again!

1529
01:41:57,680 --> 01:42:00,400
Good morning, sir. - Good morning.

1530
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:02,880
Good morning, sir. - Yes.

1531
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:04,240
Mr. Vidya Nath?

1532
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:05,760
Good morning, sir. - Good morning.

1533
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:08,480
So you are here finally! And a full 20 minutes late.

1534
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,560
I'm helpless. I stay so far away. I have to switch buses twice over.

1535
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:13,840
Here, take this.

1536
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:17,760
You needn't change buses twice over. And you can take it easy.

1537
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:20,480
What are these? - Your transfer orders.

1538
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,400
The government has merely transferred you.

1539
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:27,040
Had I owned this college, I'd have fired you, long ago.

1540
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:30,080
Please speak softly. What would the students think of me if they heard?

1541
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:36,120
What? Had you cared about that, you would've been punctual.

1542
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:38,880
Sir, I am sorry. Please stop the transfer!

1543
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:44,040
Even if it could be stopped, I wouldn't allow it.

1544
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:47,360
That's the end of my dreams!

1545
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:48,480
What is it?

1546
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,160
Are you all right? - I have been transferred to Kolhapur!

1547
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:55,000
Lovely! We can get away from the hassles over here.

1548
01:42:55,480 --> 01:42:57,320
Must you always talk silly!

1549
01:42:57,800 --> 01:42:59,880
If we go away to Kolhapur, Jeevan will usurp this house!

1550
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:02,920
Forget your woes! Try some snacks and tea instead.

1551
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:05,600
I don't want anything! - Relax! Enjoy the snack.

1552
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:07,640
I'll stop that transfer. - Can you stop the transfer?

1553
01:43:08,120 --> 01:43:09,320
I will. - How?

1554
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:10,880
Can you spare 200 bucks? - What for?

1555
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:13,480
He asks too many questions. - Give it to him.

1556
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,560
A black hen, 4 limes, vermilion, a cotton doll and a kite's feather!

1557
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:20,160
After collecting these articles and a skull of a man who died recently.

1558
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:23,760
I'll work a black magic spell to stop your transfer and save you.

1559
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:28,080
A dead man's skull? Where did you learn black magic?

1560
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:31,520
An employer kicked me out at 2 a.m.

1561
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:36,240
after I had served him for 6 months. - Who? - Manoj Kumar!

1562
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:39,680
I had no place to go.

1563
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:42,120
So, I went to a crematorium.

1564
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:46,840
I met a voodoo veteran there. I learnt the art for 6 months.

1565
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:51,480
I can kill or mutilate anyone.

1566
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,920
And I can perform all kinds of magic.

1567
01:43:55,440 --> 01:44:00,240
I can even ruin anyone with a whiff of black breath.

1568
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:03,360
Look after him, dear.

1569
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:06,160
Make sure not to displease him. - Yes, all right.

1570
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:09,520
What's up? Why are you so disturbed?

1571
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,280
Not a single insurer in 6 months!

1572
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:13,480
The boss has given me an ultimatum.

1573
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,000
If I am not able to secure an insurer, then he'll fire me!

1574
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:21,120
Forget your woes. Try this snack instead.

1575
01:44:21,640 --> 01:44:27,520
Excuse me. Now show me your palm. Sit down.

1576
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,520
What a beautiful line!

1577
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,840
Goodness! What's this? - What is it?

1578
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:35,120
Such a horrible thing!

1579
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:37,760
But you won't do what I'll ask you to do.

1580
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:39,280
It's no use. - No! Wait!

1581
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:41,040
Listen to me!

1582
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:46,480
Saturn is malefic. You must pray to Lord Bajrangbali everyday.

1583
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,800
You must stay away from your wife for a week. Complete abstinence.

1584
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:54,840
What was it about a week? - Must you interfere when men speak?

1585
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:57,560
The prayers are fine. But a week-long abstinence..

1586
01:44:58,040 --> 01:44:59,320
It's all part of the ritual. You must observe it.

1587
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:03,160
Raju, how come you know so much about palmistry? - Yes.

1588
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:06,520
I worked for two years for a famous astrologer.

1589
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:13,440
I have been juggling stars and planets all my life.

1590
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:14,480
Hello, everyone!

1591
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,480
Be seated. I'm not used to being respected anymore.

1592
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:17,480
Hi, mister. How are you?

1593
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,480
Be seated! Don't embarrass me anymore!

1594
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,160
Hi, Dad.

1595
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:25,160
Welcome, son!

1596
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:26,440
Oh, my God. - Tea?

1597
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:28,240
It's been ages since somebody else brewed tea for me!

1598
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:32,040
Careful, sip that slowly.

1599
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:35,120
Are you tying to sell vegetables? - It's a long story, Dad.

1600
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:38,320
Jeevan likes ladyfingers. Pappi loves gourds.

1601
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,880
I'll cook a sweet dish for Meena. And a spicy eggplant for grandpa.

1602
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:44,600
Mention that old fogey and I'll box your face.

1603
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:47,000
But I am his loyal servant. - What about loyalty to me?

1604
01:45:47,480 --> 01:45:48,920
There's something special about this new-found loyalty!

1605
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:52,440
The newfangled loyalty, indeed! - There's something important.

1606
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:56,280
You must ask the education minister to stop Mr. Vidyanath's transfer.

1607
01:45:56,760 --> 01:45:57,760
It'll be done. Don't do that, the old man grills me for the accounts.

1608
01:45:58,280 --> 01:45:59,120
Just a carrot! - No! He keeps grilling me!

1609
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:00,640
Take that and follow me.

1610
01:46:01,120 --> 01:46:02,040
Father, I am in a hurry. I am going. Okay?

1611
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:03,080
Just a carrot!

1612
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:04,800
Has everyone here bought life insurance?

1613
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:09,000
Even if you do, buy policies worth 200,000 each from Mr. Jeevan Nath.

1614
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:11,440
The company will pay the premium. - Why must I pay that?

1615
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:15,120
For a carrot of course! Carrots are good for health!

1616
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:19,280
Eat a carrot and keep yourself healthy.

1617
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:22,880
Hello, Mr. Vidyanath! Here you are! I've been waiting for you!

1618
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:27,160
Did you send a peon asking me to see you with the transfer order?

1619
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:29,600
What is it, sir? - Forget it all!

1620
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:31,400
There goes the transfer order!

1621
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:34,280
But the transfer to Kolhapur..

1622
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:36,360
Who's letting you go to Kolhapur?

1623
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:39,520
This college takes pride in having you!

1624
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,920
Good, Lord! This is a miracle!

1625
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:46,440
God has nothing to do with this. You've worked the miracle!

1626
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:49,360
Have I? - Yes! Why didn't you tell me

1627
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:51,600
that you are related to the Minister for Education?

1628
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:53,640
The Education Minister! A relative of mine?

1629
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:56,080
Of course! He came here personally to revoke your transfer order.

1630
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:58,280
Himself! - Yes!

1631
01:46:58,760 --> 01:46:59,720
Greetings, sir. - Greetings.

1632
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:03,240
These people are here to buy life insurance policies. - Shinde.

1633
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:09,360
Why don't you ask a few of them to buy policies from me?

1634
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:12,280
They are waiting for you.

1635
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:15,920
They insist on buying policies from you.

1636
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:18,360
What? Is that true?

1637
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:23,160
Of course! Now get to work. I'll send them in one by one.

1638
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:28,480
Looks like Raju's formula worked!

1639
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:33,600
"You love me and I love you."

1640
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:38,600
"You love me and I love you."

1641
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:43,560
"I proclaim my love for you."

1642
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:48,400
"You love me and I love you." - Wonderful!

1643
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:53,320
"You love me and I love you." - Well done!

1644
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:58,240
"I proclaim my love for you."

1645
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:02,880
"You love me and I love you."

1646
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:04,400
That was great!

1647
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:08,800
"You love me and I love you."

1648
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:11,320
Wonderful, Mr. Pappi! - Thank you.

1649
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:16,040
When did you compose that tune? - On my way here.

1650
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:18,080
Do you like it? - Very well.

1651
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:20,040
Who wrote the lyrics?

1652
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:23,040
I did. But you may give the credit to anyone you want to.

1653
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:25,080
I only want to score the music.

1654
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:28,360
You're not only a good musician. You're a good person, too.

1655
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:30,080
Thank you, sir. - Here's your cheque.

1656
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:32,000
Oh! Thank you, sir.

1657
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:34,400
When are we having the next sitting?

1658
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:36,600
I'll deposit this cheque tomorrow. It will be en-cashed the day after.

1659
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:39,880
Day-after-tomorrow, I'll appoint a secretary. You can speak to him.

1660
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:43,880
Hey!

1661
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:49,760
What are you doing?

1662
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:53,680
The sight of you sends me in raptures!

1663
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:56,040
Come on. Let's work on this together!

1664
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:57,560
Let go! Someone might see us!

1665
01:48:58,040 --> 01:49:00,600
No one will see us. Women in this house don't come to the kitchen.

1666
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:03,480
What are you doing?

1667
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,800
I'm teaching your aunt how to slice vegetables.

1668
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:07,560
Now this is how you hold it. And that's how you slice them.

1669
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:12,480
And that's done with so much love! Will you serve us food as lovingly?

1670
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:16,160
One of these days, I'll surely give you a special treat.

1671
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:19,000
This smells delicious! Are we having a feast today?

1672
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:21,800
Not a feast. But you should eat something special once in awhile.

1673
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:23,240
We surely should.

1674
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:26,440
But, it seems that something special is coming up.

1675
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:28,400
It does seem so.

1676
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:33,480
Something tells me that something good is going to happen today.

1677
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,360
May your words come true!

1678
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:38,120
Laxmi!

1679
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:39,520
Where are you?

1680
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,360
What happened? - A miracle! My transfer is revoked!

1681
01:49:44,840 --> 01:49:47,680
Raju! Your magic spell worked! My transfer has been revoked!

1682
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:51,520
The Minister of Education came personally to revoke my transfer.

1683
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,320
Just imagine what my reputation is like!

1684
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:56,040
I know what your reputation is like!

1685
01:49:56,560 --> 01:50:00,040
90% of your students failed last year.

1686
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:03,280
Had I been in charge, I would have sacked you! He talks of reputation!

1687
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:05,440
Handle him, will you? - Get out of here!

1688
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:08,440
I've done it! - What?

1689
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:10,080
I struck pay-dirt!

1690
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:12,920
I insured all of 40 people today!

1691
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:14,800
40 policies! - That's worth 8 million!

1692
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:19,640
40 policies sold at a time! It's a record for our company!

1693
01:50:20,120 --> 01:50:24,640
Really? - Yes! - Let's go upstairs!

1694
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:28,120
The Lord be praised! - Did you see what misers they are?

1695
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:31,640
They never even bothered to carry a box of sweets home.

1696
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:34,680
Had their mother been alive, she would've died of shock!

1697
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:39,000
Did you see? No one's happy that I'm not transferred.

1698
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:40,880
And my father riles me!

1699
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:44,880
Everyone is rejoicing for Jeevan!

1700
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:47,920
They are jealous of our happiness.

1701
01:50:48,440 --> 01:50:50,320
You're wrong, ma'am.

1702
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:53,080
Do you know who was instrumental in stopping the transfer?

1703
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:55,080
Who was it? - Mr. Jeevan.

1704
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:57,760
What has Jeevan got to do with my transfer?

1705
01:50:58,280 --> 01:51:00,760
I have no idea. But I heard him speaking to someone over the phone.

1706
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:02,720
He was telling him that my brother is in trouble.

1707
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:07,080
Please stop his transfer anyhow. I request you. I beg of you.

1708
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:12,720
I have never seen a brother care so much.

1709
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:17,040
I hide the sweets away. Else, the box would've been snatched.

1710
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:21,720
You did the right thing. And you are a rich man, too!

1711
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:23,400
And you are a rich man's wife!

1712
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:26,160
Mr. Vidyanath has the first right to the sweets.

1713
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:28,720
Offer him first.

1714
01:51:29,240 --> 01:51:29,600
How am I concerned about him?

1715
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:31,680
Are you not concerned?

1716
01:51:32,160 --> 01:51:34,720
I have heard him pleading to a businessman.

1717
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:37,520
He requested the businessman to have his workers insured by you.

1718
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:38,600
Else, you would have lost your job!

1719
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:42,080
And you ask me how you are concerned!

1720
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:43,880
Is that true?

1721
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:49,640
I've never seen such love for a brother!

1722
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:53,640
I can't hold back my tears!

1723
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:02,760
Brother! So it was you! - Jeevan!

1724
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:08,120
Don't!

1725
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:11,920
I..

1726
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:14,760
Here, have a sweet.

1727
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:19,840
Here's one for you. - After you.

1728
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:21,480
Dad! - Dad!

1729
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,480
Have a sweet! - Have a sweet!

1730
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:24,600
No. I have diabetes.

1731
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:25,760
Come on, Dad!

1732
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:30,360
Just a little bit. - And a little bit from me.

1733
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:33,440
Any plans for feeding me to death? - None at all!

1734
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:35,680
Bless my teacher! I have a great news!

1735
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:37,640
Watch your head. Else, I'll miss the news!

1736
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:42,000
I've been made a music director! I sang the duet you composed for him!

1737
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:44,720
Guess what he did? He embraced me!

1738
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:45,680
Ketan Desai! - Yes!

1739
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:46,680
And he embraced you, is it? - Yes!

1740
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:48,400
This is the real good news! - Oh, yes. It is.

1741
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:50,920
Who is Ketan Desai? - A textile magnate.

1742
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:55,920
I see! God must have sent us all the happiness in the world.

1743
01:52:56,440 --> 01:53:03,480
"Should I dance as gracefully as they dance in UP?"

1744
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,280
"Should I dance as gracefully as they dance in UP?"

1745
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:09,480
"Or should I dance like a hero?"

1746
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,120
"Should I dance as gracefully as they dance in UP?"

1747
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:15,280
"Or should I dance like a hero?"

1748
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:19,040
"I will dance, Oh, darling. I will dance."

1749
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:22,640
"I will dance, Oh, darling. I will dance."

1750
01:53:23,120 --> 01:53:25,400
"I will dance like a hero"

1751
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:28,480
"and I will also make you dance with me."

1752
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,280
"I will dance like a hero"

1753
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:33,920
"and I will also make you dance with me."

1754
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:37,040
"Should I dance as gracefully as they dance in UP?"

1755
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:41,040
"Or should I dance like a hero?"

1756
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:58,400
"So much happiness has come after such a long time."

1757
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:02,240
"So much happiness has come after such a long time."

1758
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:06,160
"Look, my walk has started to become tipsy."

1759
01:54:06,680 --> 01:54:09,680
"Look, my walk has started to become tipsy."

1760
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:14,320
"Should I move with as much style as the women in MP?"

1761
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:17,160
"Or should I dance like a hero?"

1762
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:20,160
"Should I move with as much style as the women in MP?"

1763
01:54:20,680 --> 01:54:22,720
"Or should I dance like a hero?"

1764
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:27,080
"I will dance, Oh, darling. I will dance."

1765
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:30,680
"I will dance, Oh, darling. I will dance."

1766
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:36,600
"I'll dance like a hero and I will also make you dance with me."

1767
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:39,400
"I will dance like a hero"

1768
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:43,400
"and I will also make you dance with me."

1769
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:09,360
"Why you look at me in secret?"

1770
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:13,240
"Why you look at me in secret?"

1771
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:17,000
"As if a lightning shines in the clouds."

1772
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:20,840
"As if a lightning shines in the clouds."

1773
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:25,240
"Should I dance as they dance in Mumbai?"

1774
01:55:25,720 --> 01:55:28,480
"Or should I dance like a hero?"

1775
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,160
"Should I dance as they dance in Mumbai?"

1776
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:34,080
"Or should I dance like a hero?"

1777
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:37,880
"I will dance, Oh, darling. I will dance."

1778
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:41,680
"I will dance, Oh, darling. I will dance."

1779
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:44,480
"I will dance like a hero"

1780
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,480
"and I will also make you dance with me."

1781
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,480
"I will dance like a hero"

1782
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:54,480
"and I will also make you dance with me."

1783
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:16,440
"Please somebody tie the nuptial chaplet to my head."

1784
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:20,320
"Please somebody tie the nuptial chaplet to my head."

1785
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:24,240
"Please somebody introduce me to my future wife."

1786
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:27,920
"Please somebody introduce me to my future wife."

1787
01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:32,440
"Should I play the drums as they do in Delhi?"

1788
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:35,560
"Or should I dance like a hero?"

1789
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:38,360
"Should I play the drums as they do in Delhi?"

1790
01:56:38,840 --> 01:56:40,920
"Or should I dance like a hero?"

1791
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:45,120
"I will dance, Oh, darling. I will dance."

1792
01:56:45,640 --> 01:56:48,840
"I will dance, Oh, darling. I will dance."

1793
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:51,600
"I will dance like a hero"

1794
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:54,800
"and I will also make you dance with me."

1795
01:56:55,320 --> 01:57:00,160
"I will dance like a hero and I will also make you dance with me."

1796
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:03,320
"Should I dance as gracefully as they dance in UP?"

1797
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:07,320
"Or should I dance like a hero?"

1798
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:38,440
Dad?

1799
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:40,360
What are you doing here so late at night?

1800
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:43,080
I was missing you.

1801
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:43,840
How sweet!

1802
01:57:44,360 --> 01:57:46,320
Come to the front door. I'll open it for you.

1803
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:50,320
All right.

1804
01:57:53,560 --> 01:57:55,320
Come..

1805
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:56,920
Come, Dad!

1806
01:57:57,440 --> 01:57:59,480
You shouldn't have come here so late at night.

1807
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,720
You might have forgotten the day today.

1808
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:05,240
But, could a father forget his son's birthday?

1809
01:58:05,720 --> 01:58:07,320
Oh my, God! It's my birthday!

1810
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:08,400
Bless me, Dad. - May you live long.

1811
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:11,840
You were born exactly at 12:01 a.m. on 14th of August. Today's the day.

1812
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:15,160
I have brought a cake for you.

1813
01:58:15,680 --> 01:58:16,800
Here you are.

1814
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:20,360
Should I get the kitchen knife? - Not the knife. Use your finger.

1815
01:58:20,840 --> 01:58:24,760
Cut it! - It's all right, Dad.

1816
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:30,160
Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday..

1817
01:58:30,680 --> 01:58:34,360
And a cake for my child!

1818
01:58:34,840 --> 01:58:37,880
Raju forgot to lock the door.

1819
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:41,880
This must be the bad influence of my sons.

1820
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:50,840
Get up in the middle of the night to lock doors!

1821
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:52,600
And then be up early to unlock the doors!

1822
01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:55,280
With 3 sons around the house, I'm still relegated to guard duty.

1823
01:58:55,760 --> 01:58:57,280
What a life!

1824
01:58:57,760 --> 01:58:59,680
Goodness! The old man just locked us in!

1825
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:02,880
What am I to do now? - Wait for the milkman.

1826
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:04,400
You can't leave before morning.

1827
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:06,840
Till then, let's celebrate my birthday!

1828
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:09,320
How's the idea?

1829
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:13,320
Happy Birthday to you!

1830
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:38,560
Thief!

1831
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:40,360
What happened?

1832
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:41,920
Sounds like there is a problem out there.

1833
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:43,640
Why don't you hide behind the refrigerator?

1834
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:45,840
Let me find out what's wrong. Go on, hide.

1835
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:50,240
Where the hell is everyone? Morons! There's a thief!

1836
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:51,680
What happened?

1837
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:54,640
He cleaned out my safe! I'm ruined!

1838
01:59:55,120 --> 01:59:59,240
Who? - A thief! Cleaned the safe!

1839
01:59:59,720 --> 02:00:00,360
Do you suspect anyone?

1840
02:00:00,840 --> 02:00:02,600
Had he given us our share of the family jewels, some of it

1841
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:04,280
could've been saved! - Of course!

1842
02:00:04,760 --> 02:00:06,760
The jewellery I wore the other day would've been safe

1843
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:08,440
had I not returned it to him!

1844
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:12,480
Shut up! How selfish can you be! Stop cribbing about your losses!

1845
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,640
One of you could at least call the police! Raju? - Yes.

1846
02:00:15,120 --> 02:00:16,400
Have you ever served in a policeman's house?

1847
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:19,160
Yes, I have. And that's why I'll advise you not to call the police!

1848
02:00:19,680 --> 02:00:21,760
The police are dangerous. They'll even beat up members of the family.

1849
02:00:22,280 --> 02:00:23,720
Let them beat these fellows up! I want my stuff back! That's all.

1850
02:00:24,240 --> 02:00:25,800
Will you have your children beaten up for the sake of money?

1851
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:29,800
To hell with them! It's a good excuse anyway! Call the cops.

1852
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:36,400
Come in, Inspector.

1853
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:39,520
What an unfortunate thing to happen!

1854
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:44,600
All gone! A lifetime of savings! My father's legacy! Family heirlooms!

1855
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:47,560
Don't worry. Do you suspect anyone?

1856
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:50,880
These people are members of the family. How can I suspect anyone?

1857
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:54,280
Who is he? - He's a trusted servant.

1858
02:00:54,760 --> 02:00:58,040
I can suspect my sons but not him. Don't worry. - So sweet.

1859
02:00:58,560 --> 02:00:59,840
But he doesn't look like a servant.

1860
02:01:00,360 --> 02:01:01,480
A matter of lineage, you see.

1861
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,600
You speak, too much. - There is freedom of speech.

1862
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:05,480
You're impertinent, too.

1863
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:06,600
Get me a glass of water.

1864
02:01:07,080 --> 02:01:08,520
A glass of water. - I'll get it.

1865
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:12,520
Be seated.

1866
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:19,560
The thief!

1867
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:20,920
The thief!

1868
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:23,840
The thief!

1869
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:25,040
The thief is in there. - Where?

1870
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:29,160
Behind the kitchen closet! - Please take a look.

1871
02:01:29,680 --> 02:01:31,600
May I take a look? - Wait right here.

1872
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:35,600
Don't go in there. He might have a weapon! - Not even a nail-cutter.

1873
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:40,640
Raju's uncle!

1874
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:45,360
I get it! The uncle and the nephew burgle houses!

1875
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:50,280
in someone you don't even know. You can see that for yourself, Dad.

1876
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:53,240
Father, can you ever find a servant

1877
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:56,480
who takes just Rs. 300 as salary in the days of such high inflation?

1878
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:00,440
I knew something was amiss with his gift of the gab.

1879
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:02,560
But who could ever speak up to your father?

1880
02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:08,360
Uncle, these people are getting more and more disrespectful.

1881
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:12,680
Before things get worse, we should get out of here.

1882
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:15,040
Stop!

1883
02:02:15,560 --> 02:02:19,480
Is this how you repay my love and my trust?

1884
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,000
Take them away! - Come along.

1885
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:24,920
Stop!

1886
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:28,480
This is the limit! I can't take it anymore.

1887
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Meena!

1888
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:34,520
What kind of a person are you?

1889
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:36,840
None of them understand how we love each other!

1890
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:39,440
Have you gone out of your mind? - Yes! I've gone mad!

1891
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:42,120
Your hollow principles, fake ideals

1892
02:02:42,640 --> 02:02:45,480
and obstinacy are driving me mad!

1893
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:47,800
You call this man a thief!

1894
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:49,480
Do you know who he is?

1895
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,320
No! Don't! - I must! Let me say it!

1896
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:54,920
He is Mr. Dhanraj

1897
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:57,680
and this is his son, Rajesh.

1898
02:02:58,160 --> 02:03:00,360
He's the one I am in love with.

1899
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:01,480
Just because you are stubborn!

1900
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:05,240
Rajesh is surrounded by servants in his house.

1901
02:03:05,720 --> 02:03:09,560
And here he is, working as a servant in our household.

1902
02:03:10,040 --> 02:03:11,840
And he does it for the sake of my love!

1903
02:03:12,360 --> 02:03:16,520
And he did it to win your hearts.

1904
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:22,120
Had he wanted to, we could have eloped.

1905
02:03:22,640 --> 02:03:28,000
But he never did that.

1906
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:33,480
You think he's a thief! But he's the one who stopped your transfer.

1907
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:38,080
And you were happy for the policies you sold, right?

1908
02:03:38,600 --> 02:03:40,600
Rajesh did it for you.

1909
02:03:41,080 --> 02:03:45,000
He paid his employees to buy policies from you.

1910
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:50,080
And who saved Dimple from the goons? Ask her!

1911
02:03:50,600 --> 02:03:54,600
Had Raju not helped her, Dimple wouldn't have been alive.

1912
02:03:55,080 --> 02:04:01,440
Enough. Say no more.

1913
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:08,640
Mr. Dinanath, if my son has erred unwittingly, I apologise for him.

1914
02:04:09,120 --> 02:04:11,400
No! Don't apologise for me. You have done enough for me.

1915
02:04:11,880 --> 02:04:14,720
No father would do what you have done for me!

1916
02:04:15,240 --> 02:04:20,440
Enough is enough.

1917
02:04:20,920 --> 02:04:23,000
I have received a lot of love from your family.

1918
02:04:23,480 --> 02:04:26,440
I apologise if I have ever cooked anything badly.

1919
02:04:26,920 --> 02:04:29,000
I know that most people here love me. In fact everyone here loves me.

1920
02:04:29,480 --> 02:04:31,840
He loves me, too. But he is creating a scene over this.

1921
02:04:32,360 --> 02:04:38,280
But please do not speak ill about my love for Meena. I won't like it.

1922
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:40,640
Let's leave, Dad.

1923
02:04:41,120 --> 02:04:42,800
I will get up at 7 o'clock sharp.

1924
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:44,400
I will eat my breakfast at 8 o'clock.

1925
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:46,040
And I will go to office at 9 o'clock.

1926
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:47,280
I love you.

1927
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:51,280
Let's go.

1928
02:05:08,240 --> 02:05:08,920
It's past 7!

1929
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:11,360
What's the matter? I was seeing such a lovely dream!

1930
02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:12,640
What was it?

1931
02:05:13,120 --> 02:05:14,400
That you and Meena have married.

1932
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:18,080
I saw that I'd become a grandfather of a dozen! I'm playing with them!

1933
02:05:18,600 --> 02:05:21,240
That was in the dream. And what do you find now that you are awake?

1934
02:05:21,720 --> 02:05:23,000
Just you and me. That's the stark reality.

1935
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:27,160
It's 7 now. Breakfast at 8. And we leave for work at 9. Now get up.

1936
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:29,000
Yes, Dad.

1937
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:31,280
Come on, Dad! - Coming!

1938
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:33,000
Dad! - I am coming!

1939
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:33,920
You are late!

1940
02:05:34,440 --> 02:05:38,040
I am coming! I am ready. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1941
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:39,880
Dad, you are five minutes late.

1942
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:42,880
In the future it will not be repeated. - I don't like it.

1943
02:05:43,400 --> 02:05:45,240
Okay, you are forgiven. You can sit.

1944
02:05:45,720 --> 02:05:45,920
Yes.

1945
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:48,480
Why are you staring at me?

1946
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,360
I know you're hurt deep down inside.

1947
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:54,480
Inside the lungs? Or is it inside the intestines?

1948
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:56,040
In your heart.

1949
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:58,560
If you want me to, I can apologise to Mr. Dinanath.

1950
02:05:59,040 --> 02:06:00,920
No way! You aren't going to see that obstinate old man.

1951
02:06:01,440 --> 02:06:02,480
Why should you?

1952
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,040
Besides, how deep is this relationship with Meena?

1953
02:06:05,560 --> 02:06:07,800
She's just a stranger with whom I had a brief affair.

1954
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:10,600
Falling in and out of love is part of life. These things happen.

1955
02:06:11,080 --> 02:06:14,720
But you are my father. And you're my mother.

1956
02:06:15,240 --> 02:06:17,120
And a brother. And a friend!

1957
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:23,120
Is it worth leaving so many people for the sake of a girl?

1958
02:06:23,640 --> 02:06:26,840
If you don't sit in the car right now, I'm dumping you.

1959
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:30,840
Will you sit or not? - Oh, yes.

1960
02:06:35,480 --> 02:06:39,000
Come on. Come on, my Father.

1961
02:07:08,320 --> 02:07:11,800
Look at this! And don't stare!

1962
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,640
Want me to fix the old man? - Shut up.

1963
02:07:24,120 --> 02:07:27,600
I just thought it'd please you. - Really? How about pleasing you?

1964
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:31,600
Do what you want. I don't care. - Very well. Just watch this.

1965
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:41,080
I had smeared you with muck.

1966
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:43,920
Now you have smeared me. That settles scores.

1967
02:07:44,440 --> 02:07:47,720
Something still remains unsettled.

1968
02:07:48,240 --> 02:07:49,520
Come here.

1969
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:53,520
Raju, come here.

1970
02:08:03,160 --> 02:08:05,480
That settles the score. - Thank you.

1971
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:09,040
Have you gone out of your mind? Give her that hand!

1972
02:08:09,560 --> 02:08:10,400
What's up? - Hold his hand.

1973
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:14,400
Forget the hands. That's what you do!

1974
02:08:17,880 --> 02:08:21,120
She's marrying her servant!

1975
02:08:21,640 --> 02:08:24,720
Had I not left the job or burgled the house

1976
02:08:25,240 --> 02:08:27,000
the girl would've been mine!

1977
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:29,480
The two old fools! There they are.

1978
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,480
Hi Raju! Didn't I tell you that Raju hails from a good family?

1979
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,480
I had smelt that something was amiss with them!

1980
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,160
You never had the time for it. I had told you about them.

1981
02:08:38,680 --> 02:08:42,480
I knew every secret there was! - Now that's the truth.

1982
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:46,440
This is the right choice, baby! - Oh, yes!

1983
02:08:46,920 --> 02:08:48,840
Look at that! - What?

1984
02:08:49,360 --> 02:08:53,400
The End! - Oh, yes!

1985
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:58,000
"Your heart is so admirable, just like gold."

1986
02:08:58,480 --> 02:09:02,640
"Listen to what my heartbeat wants to say."

1987
02:09:03,120 --> 02:09:07,320
"Your heart is so admirable, just like gold."

1988
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:12,000
"Listen to what my heartbeat wants to say."

1989
02:09:12,480 --> 02:09:14,320
"You are mine.."

1990
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:16,600
"You are my, hero number one!"

1991
02:09:17,080 --> 02:09:18,840
"You are mine.."

1992
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:22,840
"You are my, hero number one!"

1993
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:30,600
"Your heart is so admirable, just like gold."

1994
02:09:31,080 --> 02:09:35,280
"Listen to what my heartbeat wants to say."

1995
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:37,400
"I am yours.."

1996
02:09:37,880 --> 02:09:39,920
"I am your, hero number one!"

1997
02:09:40,440 --> 02:09:42,280
"I am yours.."

1998
02:09:42,760 --> 02:09:44,520
"I am your, hero number one!"

1999
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:52,600
"I have run away with you from your house."

2000
02:09:53,080 --> 02:09:56,520
"Because I fear your dad. I fear your dad."

2001
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:01,000
"Because I fear your dad. I fear your dad."

2002
02:10:01,480 --> 02:10:05,080
"I will take you away from everybody's evil eyes."

2003
02:10:05,600 --> 02:10:09,000
"I will take you away from everybody's evil eyes."

2004
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:13,000
"Because I fear your dad. I fear your dad."

2005
02:10:13,480 --> 02:10:17,440
"Because I fear your dad. I fear your dad."

2006
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:21,280
"I have run away with you from my house."

2007
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:25,480
"Because I fear my dad. I fear my dad."

2008
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:31,920
"Because I fear my dad. I fear my dad."
