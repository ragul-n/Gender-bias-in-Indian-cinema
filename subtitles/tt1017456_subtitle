1
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:15,481
'This is Durban's
biggest race track.'

2
00:06:16,756 --> 00:06:19,156
'Here, dreams ride on horsebacks.'

3
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:25,487
'And to turn these
dreams into reality..

4
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:31,094
..people live, die, and kill too.'

5
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:38,509
'Today is the
season's biggest race.'

6
00:06:40,046 --> 00:06:41,104
Durban Cup.

7
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,524
'This is Ranvir Singh!'

8
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,935
'Here, Ranvir
Singh's horses run too.'

9
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:08,267
'Ranvir likes races a lot.'

10
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:10,734
'Not to win, but to live it.'

11
00:07:12,078 --> 00:07:13,136
'Race is his life.'

12
00:07:15,548 --> 00:07:16,606
'Stallions.'

13
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,542
'This ranch house is owned by..

14
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,747
..Ranvir Singh and his
younger brother, Rajiv Singh.'

15
00:07:29,763 --> 00:07:31,162
'Horses of the finest
breed are bred here.'

16
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:32,756
'They are trained.'

17
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:35,634
'Bred.'

18
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:37,564
'They are sold.'

19
00:07:37,904 --> 00:07:39,565
'And they run in the races too.'

20
00:07:44,244 --> 00:07:45,575
'Other than races,
Ranvir Singh's passion..

21
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:47,772
..is outdoor sports.'

22
00:07:54,587 --> 00:07:55,645
'Especially, something
that involves, excitement..

23
00:07:55,722 --> 00:07:57,121
..thrill, danger..
and threat to life!'

24
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,678
'He lives life on the edge.'

25
00:08:21,614 --> 00:08:24,344
'This is Ranvir's jockey, Monto!'

26
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:27,686
'Monto controls all
of Ranvir's horses.'

27
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:35,156
'This is Ranvir's rival,
Kabir Ahuja!'

28
00:08:36,696 --> 00:08:38,095
'He is a very big bookie, too.'

29
00:08:38,698 --> 00:08:40,222
'His horses take
part in the races, too.'

30
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:43,628
'lf there is anyone
who can contest Ranvir..

31
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:45,637
..then it's only Kabir.'

32
00:08:46,773 --> 00:08:48,365
'Horses run alone in the races.'

33
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:53,635
'But in real life, a
person needs a companion.'

34
00:08:57,917 --> 00:09:00,647
'This is Sonia, an upcoming model.'

35
00:09:04,657 --> 00:09:09,651
'She is in search of a person
who can immerse her in his heart.'

36
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:14,866
'Often, love starts
through the eyes.'

37
00:09:17,937 --> 00:09:21,134
'And it increases
with regular meetings.'

38
00:09:26,212 --> 00:09:29,670
'Both have come quite
close to each other.'

39
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:31,683
'They only need to propose. '

40
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,691
'This is Rajiv Singh!'

41
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:47,232
'Ranvir's younger brother.'

42
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:50,896
'People usually have
tea when they get up.'

43
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:53,896
Get up sir, it's morning. Beer.

44
00:09:54,307 --> 00:09:58,710
'But to get rid of the hangover
of the night, Rajiv drinks beer.'

45
00:10:00,713 --> 00:10:03,307
Rajiv isn't interested
in his family business.

46
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,710
'Ranvir loves his brother a lot.'

47
00:10:10,256 --> 00:10:11,723
'But Rajiv loves alcohol.'

48
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:22,399
On which horse?
- White Lightning.

49
00:10:29,742 --> 00:10:32,210
'Sophia, Ranvir's secretary!'

50
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:40,080
'Sophia loves Ranvir.'

51
00:10:41,754 --> 00:10:42,812
Thank you, l'd forgotten!

52
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:45,751
'But Ranvir thinks
it's just her efficiency.'

53
00:10:51,364 --> 00:10:52,763
Hi Rajeev.
- Hi.

54
00:10:56,502 --> 00:10:58,163
lt is at the top most.
- Oh yes!

55
00:10:59,973 --> 00:11:01,031
'Ranvir's horse, White Lightning..

56
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:03,234
..is the hot
favourite of today's race.'

57
00:11:04,177 --> 00:11:05,769
'Ranvir has betted a lot
of money on today's race.'

58
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:10,442
'Today, on it's win, a lot of
Ranvir's problems will be solved.'

59
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:29,795
Come on!

60
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:33,804
Come on! Buck up!

61
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:38,868
Come on!

62
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:54,350
Come on!

63
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:24,380
This is cheating!

64
00:12:26,325 --> 00:12:27,383
l will not spare him!

65
00:12:29,195 --> 00:12:31,857
Thank you very much.

66
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:32,989
l hope you won some money.

67
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:36,392
Sign here, sir.

68
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:44,876
l will see you in the office.
- Thank you, sir.

69
00:12:51,484 --> 00:12:52,542
Bad luck, Ranvir.

70
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:54,944
You lost.

71
00:12:55,354 --> 00:12:56,412
l am sorry.

72
00:12:57,423 --> 00:13:00,483
Don't be. l celebrate my defeat too.

73
00:13:00,893 --> 00:13:04,886
Really? lf you throw a
party then do invite me.

74
00:13:11,637 --> 00:13:12,899
He laughs a lot.

75
00:13:14,507 --> 00:13:17,908
When a person laughs a lot,
he also cries a lot.

76
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,198
Yes, thanks for coming.

77
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:51,133
That's the money.
- Thank you.

78
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:00,543
He's leaving.

79
00:14:00,953 --> 00:14:02,420
Who can stop someone's departure?

80
00:14:27,713 --> 00:14:29,374
Wake up and feel the pace.

81
00:14:29,982 --> 00:14:31,973
Don't stop, there
is a lot in the race.

82
00:14:32,585 --> 00:14:35,179
Race.

83
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:41,126
Wake up and feel the pace.

84
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:44,991
Don't stop, there
is a lot in the race.

85
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,993
Race.

86
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,418
'The lives of these 4 people..

87
00:15:15,494 --> 00:15:16,552
..would have
continued the same way.'

88
00:15:19,765 --> 00:15:21,027
'lf this incident
wouldn't have taken place..

89
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,159
..today, on the 7th of October.'

90
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:20,350
Great!

91
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,818
Fantastic!

92
00:16:23,095 --> 00:16:24,153
Everything is normal!

93
00:16:25,097 --> 00:16:27,088
Even after such a big accident,
you are normal.

94
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,558
lt is a miracle.

95
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:30,293
No, no doctor it is not a miracle.

96
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,105
My brother is a very tough guy.
- lsn't that right?

97
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:35,631
Yes!

98
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:39,506
So, how much money are
you going to charge Ronny?

99
00:16:39,712 --> 00:16:40,770
What?

100
00:16:42,515 --> 00:16:45,109
l mean, for how many days
will you keep Ronny here?

101
00:16:45,184 --> 00:16:47,652
At least 15-20 days.

102
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:49,445
That will pass by soon.

103
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:52,118
Fine, Mr. Rajiv
whenever you are free..

104
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:54,125
..come and meet me in my office.

105
00:16:54,193 --> 00:16:55,387
l need you to sign some papers.
- Sure, doctor.

106
00:16:55,461 --> 00:16:56,860
We will meet in the evening!
- Sure.

107
00:16:57,129 --> 00:16:58,187
Nurse, come with me.

108
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:02,859
Sit.

109
00:17:04,136 --> 00:17:08,129
Ronny, are you fine? Get well soon!

110
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,667
l don't know how to say all that.

111
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:12,402
Just remember one thing.

112
00:17:13,612 --> 00:17:15,136
Without you, l will
be left all alone.

113
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:17,206
Don't worry, Rajiv.

114
00:17:17,616 --> 00:17:18,742
Nothing will happen to me.

115
00:17:20,152 --> 00:17:21,210
ls it paining?

116
00:17:21,287 --> 00:17:22,345
Yes!

117
00:17:22,621 --> 00:17:24,145
Not that, have a few sips of this..

118
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,214
..everything will vanish!

119
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:27,884
Very funny!

120
00:17:32,498 --> 00:17:34,693
Rajiv!
- Sorry.

121
00:17:36,168 --> 00:17:37,897
l'll go and complete
the formalities, okay?

122
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:40,830
You got to be fine.

123
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:53,843
Hello!

124
00:18:10,202 --> 00:18:12,193
Cheers!

125
00:18:12,338 --> 00:18:13,805
To my brother's long life!

126
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:18,868
Cheers.
- Give it to everyone.

127
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:39,225
Thank you for coming.

128
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:40,356
Thank you.

129
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:41,891
l am sorry l am late.

130
00:18:42,902 --> 00:18:45,496
Those whom we wait for,
often come late.

131
00:18:45,838 --> 00:18:48,238
And often, those who
come late are wonderful.

132
00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:51,436
This is my younger brother Rajiv.

133
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,240
Hi!
- Nice to meet you. - Me, too.

134
00:18:54,513 --> 00:18:55,912
This is my P.A Sophia!

135
00:18:56,315 --> 00:18:57,782
Hi, nice to meet you.

136
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,647
And this is my friend, Sonia!

137
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:03,445
Mr. Mickey has come.

138
00:19:04,857 --> 00:19:05,915
Please excuse me.

139
00:19:06,258 --> 00:19:07,316
Rajiv will look after you.

140
00:19:07,993 --> 00:19:09,255
Okay.
- Bye. - Bye.

141
00:19:10,262 --> 00:19:11,320
Can l get you a drink?

142
00:19:12,264 --> 00:19:13,322
Sure.

143
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:14,457
This way.

144
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:17,529
Now l know why Ronny doesn't drink.

145
00:19:18,471 --> 00:19:20,462
After seeing you, he doesn't
need any other intoxication.

146
00:19:22,274 --> 00:19:23,866
You are praising me a lot.

147
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,468
lf you see from my point
of view, you'll know..

148
00:19:25,544 --> 00:19:26,943
..l'm praising you very little.

149
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,411
By the way, what do you
think about love at first sight?

150
00:19:32,351 --> 00:19:33,409
lt saves time!

151
00:19:34,487 --> 00:19:35,954
lt saves time! l love that.

152
00:19:36,622 --> 00:19:37,680
You know we think alike.

153
00:19:39,024 --> 00:19:40,616
Ronny never mentioned about you.

154
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,018
How long have you known each other?

155
00:19:42,695 --> 00:19:44,026
About 2-3 months.

156
00:19:44,897 --> 00:19:45,955
Anything serious?

157
00:19:46,298 --> 00:19:47,356
Don't say yes!

158
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:48,491
Don't say yes! Please.

159
00:19:49,034 --> 00:19:50,296
Why are you asking?

160
00:19:52,838 --> 00:19:55,636
Because.. you know what?

161
00:19:56,308 --> 00:19:57,366
Give me one minute.

162
00:19:58,577 --> 00:19:59,635
Make him agree.

163
00:20:00,846 --> 00:20:03,440
Hello, where is Rajiv!
- l don't know.

164
00:20:03,516 --> 00:20:04,983
He said he'll be back in a minute.

165
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:07,510
Shall l tell you one thing?

166
00:20:07,853 --> 00:20:09,320
You two are quite different.

167
00:20:09,722 --> 00:20:11,917
When it's about girls,
he's faster than you!

168
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:14,917
Not bad.

169
00:20:14,994 --> 00:20:16,928
He has impressed you a
lot in the first meeting.

170
00:20:26,605 --> 00:20:28,334
Akbar!

171
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:49,092
The entire world is enthralled.

172
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:52,762
lt is such a wonderful encounter.

173
00:20:53,365 --> 00:20:54,559
There is restlessness.

174
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:59,837
l am finally saying
what was in my heart.

175
00:21:00,372 --> 00:21:03,364
Come in my arms, charm me..

176
00:21:03,442 --> 00:21:06,377
..come baby shake it,
shake it some more.

177
00:21:06,712 --> 00:21:08,839
O baby, rock the dance floor!

178
00:21:09,114 --> 00:21:10,638
Rock the dance floor!

179
00:21:11,116 --> 00:21:12,845
That's the show before you!

180
00:21:12,918 --> 00:21:14,579
That's the show behind you!

181
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:19,991
Rock! Rock! Rock! Rock!

00:21:41,947 --> 00:21:43,608
Rock! Rock! Rock! Rock!

183
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:45,541
Lost in my dreams.

184
00:21:45,618 --> 00:21:47,415
Time has stopped.

185
00:21:47,486 --> 00:21:51,422
They make a gesture to me slyly.

186
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,957
l won't say anything.

187
00:21:53,025 --> 00:21:54,617
l will keep tight-lipped.

188
00:21:54,693 --> 00:21:58,424
l will unite the hearts slyly!

189
00:21:58,497 --> 00:22:04,697
Lock eyes, excite me, come

The entire world is enthralled.

00:23:22,247 --> 00:23:25,648
lt is such a wonderful encounter.

210
00:23:25,851 --> 00:23:27,512
There is restlessness.

211
00:23:27,653 --> 00:23:32,920
l am finally saying
what was in my heart.

212
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:35,524

Are you done? Or should
l bring another bottle?

221
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:17,760
Did you have fun?

222
00:24:19,171 --> 00:24:23,699
Brother, people say that
alcohol is slow poison.

223
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,634
ls it true?

224
00:24:26,111 --> 00:24:27,169
Yes, it's true.

225
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:30,309
Very good. l don't
want to die early.

226
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:35,778
Come inside.

227
00:24:35,854 --> 00:24:37,583
Come on.

228
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:44,591
People also say, if
you drink too much..

229
00:24:44,663 --> 00:24:49,191
..you don't remain in your senses.

230
00:24:50,002 --> 00:24:51,663
ls it correct?
- Yes, correct.

231
00:24:52,004 --> 00:24:55,804
Very good. We don't have to go to
the moon that we need our senses!

232
00:24:59,745 --> 00:25:01,610
Careful!

233
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,342
Sorry brother.

234
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:10,882
People also say that love is
more intoxicating than alcohol.

235
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:13,351
lt's all true, Rajiv.

236
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:15,286
Everything will be right,
come on now lets go inside.

237
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,622
No, no.

238
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:20,359
Once Sonia enters my life.

239
00:25:22,234 --> 00:25:26,637
l will.. stop drinking..

240
00:25:26,705 --> 00:25:30,641

241
00:25:32,911 --> 00:25:35,971
She is beautiful.

242
00:25:36,915 --> 00:25:40,646
She is really..

243
00:25:43,655 --> 00:25:47,648
Just.. just.. just

244
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:51,655

Good morning!

00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:40,369
Anything urgent?

248
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:43,778
Yes, you have to submit some
documents in the excise department.

249
00:26:43,849 --> 00:26:45,043
Your signatures are needed.

250
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:48,377
Take a look.

251
00:26:50,322 --> 00:26:51,380
You are looking good.

252
00:26:52,057 --> 00:26:53,456
l am talking about the documents.

253
00:26:55,727 --> 00:26:56,785
You check them.

254
00:26:59,264 --> 00:27:03,724
Anything else?
- Yes, the bank manager had called.

255
00:27:04,069 --> 00:27:06,731
You have to pay 4
installments of the ranch mortgage.

256
00:27:07,472 --> 00:27:08,734
Okay, do one thing.

257
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:10,941
Contact any estate
agency in Cape Town.

258
00:27:11,476 --> 00:27:12,738
Yes.
- l have a property there.

259
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:14,938
l want to sell it and
clear all my bank dues.

260
00:27:15,013 --> 00:27:16,139
Okay.
- As soon as possible.

261
00:27:16,214 --> 00:27:17,272
Good morning ma'am!

262
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:18,407
Good morning.

263
00:27:18,483 --> 00:27:20,417
Sam, take this back.

264
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:22,748
And bring a glass of
water with two disprins.

265
00:27:22,821 --> 00:27:25,221
But Rajiv sir has this
drink every morning.

266
00:27:26,024 --> 00:27:28,015
Sam..
- Right, sir.

267
00:27:30,228 --> 00:27:32,492
Carry on, l will meet you
later in the office. - Okay!

268
00:27:39,504 --> 00:27:40,766
Hello. Are you alright.

269
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,166
l had a bit too much yesterday,
my head is paining.

270
00:27:44,443 --> 00:27:47,037
ls that it, or is
there something else?

271
00:27:49,381 --> 00:27:50,439
Where is the beer?

272
00:27:52,517 --> 00:27:54,451
You can get rid of your
hangover with this too.

273
00:27:58,323 --> 00:27:59,790
Remember what you said yesterday?

274
00:28:00,392 --> 00:28:01,450
What?

275
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:06,058
That, if Sonia enters your life,
you will stop drinking.

276
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:09,392
l was drunk, brother.

277
00:28:10,202 --> 00:28:12,193
People usually tell the
truth when they are drunk.

278
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:18,205
How can she ever enter the
life of a drunkard like me?

279
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:19,868
What if she does?

280
00:28:20,412 --> 00:28:21,811
How can she brother?

281
00:28:22,814 --> 00:28:23,872
What if she does?

282
00:28:27,085 --> 00:28:28,143
Then l will stop drinking.

283
00:28:29,021 --> 00:28:32,821
Fine. lf you want to
have lunch with Sonia..

284
00:28:32,891 --> 00:28:36,554
..then come to club,
exactly at 1 :00.

285
00:28:36,962 --> 00:28:38,020
Don't be late.

286
00:28:38,096 --> 00:28:39,154
Lunch, with Sonia.
- Yes, sir.

287
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:42,959
Sir, newspaper.

00:28:44,102 --> 00:28:47,902
And Sam, call me exactly
at 1 o'clock on my mobile.

289
00:28:48,306 --> 00:28:49,364
Fine, sir.

290
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,317
Well, this is a pleasant surprise!

291
00:29:00,852 --> 00:29:01,910
Hi guys.

292
00:29:02,054 --> 00:29:03,112
What are you doing here?

293
00:29:03,522 --> 00:29:04,921
Had a meeting with a client.

294
00:29:05,323 --> 00:29:07,120
As we were going back,
we spotted you.

295
00:29:07,592 --> 00:29:09,116
Mind if l join you?
- Come, sit.

296
00:29:10,862 --> 00:29:11,920
You are looking great.

297
00:29:11,997 --> 00:29:13,589
And you are
looking very fresh today.

298
00:29:16,068 --> 00:29:17,865
Rajiv, there must have
been a shortage of drinks..

299
00:29:17,936 --> 00:29:20,404
..in the party
yesterday because of you.

300
00:29:21,006 --> 00:29:22,871
Do you always..
- Oh God!

301
00:29:23,608 --> 00:29:24,870
Look.

302
00:29:24,943 --> 00:29:26,934
There are always two
reasons for drinking alcohol.

303
00:29:27,345 --> 00:29:28,403
Happiness or sorrows.

304
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,939
Yesterday, l had both the reasons.

305
00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:33,543
Happiness, because l
met you yesterday.

306
00:29:34,086 --> 00:29:37,283
And l was sad, because
we didn't we meet earlier.

307
00:29:38,557 --> 00:29:39,615
Come on, stop now.

308
00:29:40,358 --> 00:29:42,485
By the way, Sonia, what
is your plan for today?

309
00:29:42,561 --> 00:29:43,619
Nothing great.

310
00:29:43,895 --> 00:29:44,953
Then let's make it great.

311
00:29:45,163 --> 00:29:46,221
Let's have lunch together.

312
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:47,356
Sure.

313
00:29:47,899 --> 00:29:48,957
Excuse me.

314
00:29:53,905 --> 00:29:54,963
Hi Priya!

315
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:59,036
Sweetheart, l am
so sorry, l am late.

316
00:30:00,045 --> 00:30:01,103
Sweetheart!

317
00:30:01,913 --> 00:30:03,175
Come on baby, don't get angry.

318
00:30:03,915 --> 00:30:05,041
Okay, let's do one thing.

319
00:30:05,383 --> 00:30:07,442
We will have lunch
and dinner together.

320
00:30:08,186 --> 00:30:09,244
Happy?

321
00:30:10,922 --> 00:30:12,446
l love you, bye.

322
00:30:15,393 --> 00:30:17,657
Who is Priya?
- My girlfriend.

323
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,327
She has returned from
New York after 3 months.

324
00:30:20,932 --> 00:30:21,990
And because of my work..

325
00:30:22,067 --> 00:30:24,001
..l forgot l was
supposed to have lunch with her.

326
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,204
She is very angry. l will
have to go and appease her.

327
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,540
After all, it is the
question of my entire life.

328
00:30:32,611 --> 00:30:33,669
l will go too.

329
00:30:34,412 --> 00:30:37,006
Why? Do you have any
problem in having lunch with me?

330
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:39,675
lt's nothing like that.

331
00:30:39,951 --> 00:30:41,009
Then?

332
00:30:43,688 --> 00:30:44,950
Okay!

333
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,148
Great!

334
00:30:46,224 --> 00:30:47,282
Good.

335
00:30:47,692 --> 00:30:48,954
Then l will leave.

336
00:30:49,361 --> 00:30:50,419
Have fun!

337
00:30:50,629 --> 00:30:52,961
You guys have fun.
- We will.

338
00:30:55,367 --> 00:30:56,493
Wow, how nice!

339
00:30:56,968 --> 00:30:58,367
Eating alone is so great!

340
00:30:59,971 --> 00:31:02,303
Now you will say
that you're with me.

341
00:31:03,642 --> 00:31:06,975
The truth is, just
like you are with me..

342
00:31:07,045 --> 00:31:10,037
..so are all the other
customers in this restaurant.

343
00:31:10,982 --> 00:31:13,644
No one talks to me, no
one laughs at my jokes.

344
00:31:15,387 --> 00:31:16,513
What has happened to you today?

345
00:31:17,255 --> 00:31:18,313
Why are you so quiet?

346
00:31:19,057 --> 00:31:20,115
lt is nothing like that.

347
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:21,990
Won't you tell your friend?

348
00:31:23,995 --> 00:31:25,189
Love starts with friendship!

349
00:31:25,997 --> 00:31:27,726
But not every
friendship turns into love.

350
00:31:30,135 --> 00:31:31,727
Anyways, l am leaving.

351
00:31:32,737 --> 00:31:33,999
l have my fashion show tomorrow.

352
00:31:34,072 --> 00:31:35,266
l have to go for the rehearsals.

353
00:31:37,008 --> 00:31:38,066
Won't you invite your friend?

354
00:31:39,144 --> 00:31:41,009
l have sent the
invitation to your house.

355
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:42,537
Now you will come.

356
00:31:42,681 --> 00:31:43,739
Do come.

357
00:31:44,015 --> 00:31:45,676
No problem. Come, l will drop you.

358
00:31:46,151 --> 00:31:47,209
l have brought my car.

359
00:31:47,285 --> 00:31:49,014
Fantastic! Then you give me a lift.

360
00:32:29,728 --> 00:32:34,256
You have enchanted
me at first sight.

361
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,268
l have lost my heart to you.

362
00:32:41,072 --> 00:32:45,736
God knows what will happen next.

363
00:32:46,678 --> 00:32:50,546
Let's live this moment together.

364
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:56,747
l am here, you are here.

365
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:01,752
Come in my arms.

366
00:33:03,295 --> 00:33:13,227
O darling, come forget
both the worlds in my arms.

367
00:33:16,775 --> 00:33:18,106
Baby, l love you!

368
00:33:19,577 --> 00:33:20,771
Baby, l love you!

369
00:33:20,845 --> 00:33:22,107
Baby, l love you!

370
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,110
Baby, l love you, so!

371
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,444
Baby, l love you!

372
00:33:27,852 --> 00:33:29,319
Oh l love you!

373
00:33:31,122 --> 00:33:32,180
l love you!

374
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:36,124
l love you, so!

375
00:33:36,594 --> 00:33:38,118
Baby, l love you!

376
00:33:48,873 --> 00:33:53,139
All l wish for is your love.

377
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:59,143
Even a moment without
you is unimaginable.

378
00:34:00,151 --> 00:34:04,144
My heartbeats desire only you!

379
00:34:04,823 --> 00:34:07,155
You are my relief!

380
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:10,150
You are my love!

381
00:34:11,162 --> 00:34:21,163
When l found you, l lost myself.

382
00:34:22,374 --> 00:34:32,306
O darling, come forget
both the worlds in my arms.

383
00:34:38,323 --> 00:34:40,848
Ladies and gentlemen, the
designer of the evening.

384
00:34:40,925 --> 00:34:42,187
Mr. Almanor!

385
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:49,792
Baby, l love you!

386
00:34:51,403 --> 00:34:52,665
Baby, l love you!

387
00:34:54,272 --> 00:34:56,399
Baby, l love you, so!

388
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:58,266
Baby, l love you!

389
00:34:59,744 --> 00:35:01,211
Oh l love you!

390
00:35:02,881 --> 00:35:04,212
l love you!

391
00:35:05,683 --> 00:35:07,548
l love you, so!

392
00:35:13,691 --> 00:35:14,749
Which drink will you have?

393
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,959
You know l don't drink.

394
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:27,233
Rajiv, so soon we have
come so close to each other.

395
00:35:28,573 --> 00:35:29,631
Let's get married.

396
00:35:31,576 --> 00:35:32,702
How can we get married?

397
00:35:33,845 --> 00:35:34,903
Why?

398
00:35:35,513 --> 00:35:39,313
Why? Because for getting married,
there should be love.

399
00:35:41,986 --> 00:35:46,252
You think l don't love you.

400
00:35:47,725 --> 00:35:48,783
No.

401
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:50,656
Come on, now stop joking.

402
00:35:54,265 --> 00:35:57,530
l am not joking. l am serious.

403
00:36:01,272 --> 00:36:03,866
How can l fall in love
with a girl like you?

404
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:08,278
And after reading this,
not just me..

405
00:36:08,346 --> 00:36:11,474
..but no one will be
ready to marry you.

406
00:36:12,484 --> 00:36:13,542
What is this?

407
00:36:14,686 --> 00:36:15,744
Your bio-data!

408
00:36:21,426 --> 00:36:24,554
The story from your
childhood till today.

409
00:36:26,297 --> 00:36:27,958
You've been fooling people till now.

410
00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:34,367
Sonia, beautiful name.

411
00:36:35,907 --> 00:36:37,306
An orphanage of Mumbai
gave you this name..

412
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:39,309
..not your parents.

413
00:36:40,578 --> 00:36:44,309
And till the age of 15,
you did such great deeds..

414
00:36:44,382 --> 00:36:47,579
..that the court sent
you to the remand home.

415
00:36:50,321 --> 00:36:52,312
At the age of 16, you
tried to flee from there.

416
00:36:53,324 --> 00:36:56,316
And when you were caught,
you falsely accused..

417
00:36:56,394 --> 00:36:59,852
..an old rector, that he
was trying to molest you.

418
00:37:01,332 --> 00:37:02,390
What is this?

419
00:37:02,534 --> 00:37:03,592
He is still in prison.

420
00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:07,333
Then you became a bar dancer.

421
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:09,931
The owner of the bar
was crazy about you.

422
00:37:11,943 --> 00:37:13,001
Anyone can be.

423
00:37:14,746 --> 00:37:16,338
But you took undue advantage of it.

424
00:37:17,348 --> 00:37:19,339
One day, you were about to
flee with the bar money..

425
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:21,351
..when the owner caught you.

426
00:37:23,021 --> 00:37:24,079
And you killed him.

427
00:37:25,356 --> 00:37:27,347
You hit him with a
bottle on his head. Oh God!

428
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:29,417
You are dangerous.

429
00:37:30,962 --> 00:37:35,626
But the testimony of an
N.R.l lover saved you.

430
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:39,631
You came to South
Africa with him, right.

431
00:37:42,373 --> 00:37:46,366
Rajiv, l wanted to tell
you everything myself.

432
00:37:47,378 --> 00:37:50,711
But l was afraid,
that l might lose you.

433
00:37:51,382 --> 00:37:54,374
Lose me! Nice!

434
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,121
What do you think? That l just
received this file from the courier?

435
00:38:00,858 --> 00:38:03,383
l have been keeping a watch on you..

436
00:38:03,461 --> 00:38:06,726
..since you have been eyeing Ranvir.

437
00:38:28,419 --> 00:38:29,477
Come to the point.

438
00:38:30,421 --> 00:38:31,479
What do you want?

439
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:36,954
That which you want.

440
00:38:38,429 --> 00:38:39,487
Money!

441
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:43,428
The property for which
you have entrapped Ranvir..

442
00:38:43,501 --> 00:38:46,163
..is mortgaged to the bank.

443
00:38:47,705 --> 00:38:50,037
But l have a plan worth 100 million.

444
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:53,905
lf you help me, l will
give you 20 million.

445
00:38:55,713 --> 00:38:57,578
How do you have so much money?

446
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:00,440
My father, whom l
hated all my life..

447
00:39:00,518 --> 00:39:03,112
..did one good thing before dying.

448
00:39:03,855 --> 00:39:05,447
He took out insurance
policy worth 50 million each..

449
00:39:05,523 --> 00:39:06,854
..in the name of both the brothers.

450
00:39:08,459 --> 00:39:11,451
lf Ranvir dies in an accident..

451
00:39:11,529 --> 00:39:13,463
..then under the
double indemnity clause..

452
00:39:13,531 --> 00:39:15,522
..l will get 100 million.

453
00:39:17,468 --> 00:39:18,526
Wow!

454
00:39:19,003 --> 00:39:21,198
My file is nothing compared to you.

455
00:39:22,073 --> 00:39:23,472
l never saw a lowly man like you..

456
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:26,942
..who can kill his
own brother for money!

457
00:39:28,146 --> 00:39:29,204
There is no need to be amazed.

458
00:39:30,081 --> 00:39:32,481
Ranvir says himself,
that he loves me so much..

459
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,484
..that he can even die for me.

460
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:36,218
l am just fulfilling his desire.

461
00:39:37,822 --> 00:39:39,483
lf your plan is ready..

462
00:39:39,557 --> 00:39:41,491
..then what was the
need to put up a charade..

463
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:42,617
..of falling in love with me?

464
00:39:43,027 --> 00:39:47,020
Because our love should
look natural to Ranvir.

465
00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:49,225
What do l have to do now?

466
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:51,025
Marry me.

467
00:39:52,103 --> 00:39:53,968
Don't worry. This marriage
will be a business deal.

468
00:39:54,505 --> 00:39:55,563
And then?

469
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,698
First thing first, baby.

470
00:39:56,774 --> 00:39:58,765
Are you in, or are you out!

471
00:40:05,516 --> 00:40:06,574
l am in.

472
00:40:25,937 --> 00:40:26,995
Thank you.

473
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:28,663
What's the right time?

474
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,207
Sir, exactly 2 minutes 7 seconds.

475
00:40:31,542 --> 00:40:32,600
That's 7 seconds more.

476
00:40:33,878 --> 00:40:37,541
Sam, yesterday l asked you
not to sign some papers.

477
00:40:37,615 --> 00:40:38,673
Yes sir.
- Bring those papers.

478
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:39,808
Right, sir.

479
00:40:40,551 --> 00:40:41,609
Hi Ranvir!

480
00:40:42,019 --> 00:40:45,887
l think you are fond of
horses more than anyone else.

481
00:40:45,957 --> 00:40:48,551
That's not it, Kabir, l
am quite fond of you too.

482
00:40:51,562 --> 00:40:52,620
That's a good one,
that's a good joke.

483
00:40:53,698 --> 00:40:56,292
Come to the point, why
did you want to meet me?

484
00:40:57,568 --> 00:40:59,695
l have heard that this stud
farm is mortgaged to the bank.

485
00:41:00,905 --> 00:41:02,566
lf you want, l can get it released.

486
00:41:03,107 --> 00:41:04,574
Other than the
settlement with the bank..

487
00:41:04,642 --> 00:41:06,906
..l am ready to give
you 10 million dollars.

488
00:41:07,578 --> 00:41:08,772
Sell this stud farm to me.

489
00:41:13,184 --> 00:41:15,584
l have often heard, those
who have a small brain..

490
00:41:15,653 --> 00:41:18,315
..often talk big.

491
00:41:18,856 --> 00:41:19,914
l didn't understand.

492
00:41:20,591 --> 00:41:23,719
That's a good quality of yours.
You are ignorant.

493
00:41:27,064 --> 00:41:30,864
These horses, this stud
farm run through my blood.

494
00:41:32,336 --> 00:41:35,601
lt's not for sale. l
will never sell them.

495
00:41:37,608 --> 00:41:39,337
Sir, papers.

496
00:41:40,745 --> 00:41:41,939
Can l borrow your pen please?

497
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:50,746
Excuse me, that's my pen.

498
00:41:55,827 --> 00:41:56,885
Thank you.

499
00:41:57,295 --> 00:41:58,626
My offer is still open.

500
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,688
Think about it once more.

501
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,033
Kabir, l think
before taking a decision.

502
00:42:06,971 --> 00:42:08,370
l don't think after
taking a decision.

503
00:42:09,974 --> 00:42:11,032
Bye.

504
00:42:11,909 --> 00:42:12,967
Bye-bye.

505
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:32,860
Sir, in the next race, our horse
Blue Bolt is the hot favourite.

506
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,654
People have betted the most on him.

507
00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:36,057
And on the rest of the horses?

508
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,391
2-3 million have been betted
on the rest of the horses.

509
00:42:39,003 --> 00:42:40,061
And on number 12?

510
00:42:40,137 --> 00:42:41,195
What?

511
00:42:42,273 --> 00:42:45,333
l am talking about Ranvir's horse.
- Ranvir's horse is new.

512
00:42:45,676 --> 00:42:46,870
The rate is 10 to 1 !

513
00:42:47,011 --> 00:42:48,069
10 to 1 !

514
00:42:53,751 --> 00:42:57,812
Bet all my money on Ranvir's horse.

515
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:01,290
But sir.. 20 million!

516
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,417
The next race is set.

517
00:43:04,028 --> 00:43:06,690
My observation is
that after my horse..

518
00:43:06,764 --> 00:43:08,891
..Ranvir's horse is the second best.

519
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:14,160
And my horse will slow down
just before the finish line.

520
00:43:14,705 --> 00:43:16,696
Ranvir will lose
in spite of winning.

521
00:43:16,974 --> 00:43:19,772
You mean, Ranvir's horse
will win and we will earn money?

522
00:43:20,044 --> 00:43:21,102
You are right.

523
00:43:21,712 --> 00:43:22,770
Good idea, sir.

524
00:43:22,847 --> 00:43:23,905
Thank you.

525
00:43:25,049 --> 00:43:26,107
Sophia.

526
00:43:27,785 --> 00:43:29,719
Bet 4 million on Kabir's horse.

527
00:43:30,855 --> 00:43:32,447
Won't we bet on your own horse?

528
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,116
Please just do as l say.

529
00:43:37,728 --> 00:43:40,993
Horse no.12 Rising Star,
owned by Ranvir Singh.

530
00:43:41,465 --> 00:43:45,731
We've got no.6 owned by Kabir..

531
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,861
..Blue Bolt are the
main contenders inside..

532
00:43:50,341 --> 00:43:51,740
ls everything fine?
- Yes.

533
00:43:53,144 --> 00:43:55,078
Very, very fast indeed.

534
00:43:55,346 --> 00:43:56,404
They are all set.

535
00:44:04,088 --> 00:44:06,886
lt is horse no.6, Blue
Bolt towards the lead.

536
00:44:07,091 --> 00:44:10,959
lt's about to lead
the quarter in the 9..

537
00:44:41,459 --> 00:44:42,517
Come on, Blue Bolt!

538
00:44:42,793 --> 00:44:43,851
Come on, Blue Bolt!

539
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,131
Come on, Blue Bolt!

540
00:44:55,539 --> 00:44:57,200
Come on!

541
00:45:02,279 --> 00:45:03,337
O my God.

542
00:45:03,414 --> 00:45:04,472
We are ruined sir!

543
00:45:04,548 --> 00:45:05,810
We had taken a
betting of 50 million.

544
00:45:05,883 --> 00:45:07,214
We will have to pay 80 million.

545
00:45:07,818 --> 00:45:08,876
And the 20 million that
we bet on Ranvir's horse..

546
00:45:08,953 --> 00:45:10,352
..we have lost that too.

547
00:45:10,421 --> 00:45:13,879
Please, please, leave me alone..

548
00:45:14,091 --> 00:45:19,825
..please, please leave me alone!

549
00:45:31,442 --> 00:45:32,500
This is my pen.

550
00:45:33,177 --> 00:45:34,235
Microphone!

551
00:45:36,847 --> 00:45:37,905
And this is yours.

552
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:42,842
You slowed down your horse.

553
00:45:43,854 --> 00:45:46,049
l slowed down my horse a bit more.

554
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:49,856
lt's your bad luck that you won.

555
00:45:52,863 --> 00:45:54,854
By the way, l have
arranged a party today..

556
00:45:54,932 --> 00:45:57,594
..to celebrate my defeat!

557
00:46:02,073 --> 00:46:03,131
Do come.

558
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,872
lf you wanted, you could
have betted on your horse..

559
00:46:10,948 --> 00:46:13,473
..and won more.

560
00:46:14,885 --> 00:46:16,546
Victory and defeat is not
just about money, Sophia.

561
00:46:17,888 --> 00:46:20,015
lf someone defeats and
kills me, l can tolerate that.

562
00:46:20,891 --> 00:46:23,223
But l can never forgive
someone who deceives me.

563
00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:33,427
Rajiv!

564
00:46:35,573 --> 00:46:36,631
What happened?

565
00:46:38,909 --> 00:46:40,570
l proposed to Sonia today.

566
00:46:43,914 --> 00:46:44,972
And?

567
00:46:46,317 --> 00:46:49,582
And.. she said yes!

568
00:46:50,121 --> 00:46:51,986
Yes, she said yes.

569
00:46:52,323 --> 00:46:54,518
That's great! That's great!

570
00:46:54,925 --> 00:46:55,983
l want that too.

571
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,925
Baby, l love you.

572
00:46:59,663 --> 00:47:03,929
Baby, l love you.

573
00:47:10,941 --> 00:47:12,533
Baby, l love you.

574
00:47:14,545 --> 00:47:18,276
Baby, l love you.

575
00:47:18,616 --> 00:47:20,948
Forever.

576
00:47:22,286 --> 00:47:24,413
Forever.

577
00:47:26,357 --> 00:47:33,092
My nights are not lonely anymore..

578
00:47:33,164 --> 00:47:39,501
And my stars are
like shining anymore.

579
00:47:46,443 --> 00:47:48,707
Rajiv,
congratulations on your wedding.

580
00:47:49,046 --> 00:47:50,445
Careful.

581
00:48:17,208 --> 00:48:20,075
Ronny, you are still awake!

582
00:48:23,547 --> 00:48:27,005
You promised you
will never drink again.

583
00:48:27,751 --> 00:48:30,219
Brother, l didn't want to drink.

584
00:48:31,689 --> 00:48:33,156
My friends forced me.

585
00:48:35,025 --> 00:48:37,016
l am telling the truth, believe me.

586
00:48:37,094 --> 00:48:41,292
You have deceived me.
Now l cannot trust you.

587
00:48:41,365 --> 00:48:42,423
Don't say that.

588
00:48:42,499 --> 00:48:44,558
l will never drink again,
l swear on you.

589
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:52,508
Do you know the
meaning of this oath?

590
00:48:55,045 --> 00:49:00,039
lf you ever touch
alcohol again, l will die.

591
00:49:04,188 --> 00:49:06,053
That's why l have
taken such a big oath!

592
00:49:12,062 --> 00:49:13,120
Go!

593
00:49:14,665 --> 00:49:15,723
She is waiting for you.

594
00:49:39,823 --> 00:49:41,154
How did you like my performance?

595
00:49:44,161 --> 00:49:46,629
Your brother already
rewarded you for that.

596
00:49:47,698 --> 00:49:49,427
l could hear the echo
of the clap till here.

597
00:49:50,834 --> 00:49:52,699
Let's celebrate. Cheers.

598
00:49:53,103 --> 00:49:56,834
No baby, drinking is
injurious to our plan.

599
00:49:58,509 --> 00:50:01,103
lf we unknowingly make
even a small mistake..

600
00:50:01,178 --> 00:50:04,113
..Ronny won't even give
us a chance to apologise.

601
00:50:06,116 --> 00:50:08,243
ln this game, the
hunter can die too.

602
00:50:12,122 --> 00:50:13,851
Then why put up a
charade of drinking?

603
00:50:14,124 --> 00:50:15,182
This will happen everyday.

604
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:19,122
l want Ronny to realize that
he has made a big mistake..

605
00:50:19,196 --> 00:50:21,528
..by getting you
married to a drunkard.

606
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:24,793
l see. What's the plan ahead?

607
00:50:25,536 --> 00:50:29,131
l think we should call it a night.

608
00:50:31,141 --> 00:50:33,609
Why? Don't you trust your wife?

609
00:50:37,147 --> 00:50:40,605
What can l say?
Your bio-data is such.

610
00:50:43,754 --> 00:50:46,882
That's why, l can't trust
anyone else other than myself.

611
00:50:50,361 --> 00:50:53,762
By the way, our marriage was a deal.

612
00:50:55,432 --> 00:50:56,899
But if you want,
anything can happen.

613
00:51:02,172 --> 00:51:04,163
lt's not a bad idea.

614
00:51:05,175 --> 00:51:08,770
But l don't mix
business with pleasure. Okay?

615
00:51:13,183 --> 00:51:14,241
Whenever you are ready, baby.

616
00:51:28,665 --> 00:51:32,192
Ranvir, the estate agent
had called from Cape Town.

617
00:51:32,803 --> 00:51:35,328
A client is ready
to buy our property.

618
00:51:36,206 --> 00:51:37,730
The deal can be finalised in 2 days.

619
00:51:38,542 --> 00:51:40,601
l have booked 2
tickets for Cape Town.

620
00:51:42,212 --> 00:51:43,270
Fine.

621
00:51:44,548 --> 00:51:46,948
l need your
signature on some papers.

622
00:51:57,227 --> 00:51:58,285
Anything else?

623
00:52:00,564 --> 00:52:02,225
l've been observing
since a few days..

624
00:52:02,299 --> 00:52:03,561
..that you are a bit disturbed.

625
00:52:04,701 --> 00:52:05,759
What is it?

626
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,969
Rajiv has started drinking again.

627
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:14,241
After the marriage, there
hasn't been a single day..

628
00:52:14,311 --> 00:52:16,506
..when he hasn't come home drunk.

629
00:52:18,248 --> 00:52:19,374
l feel sad for Sonia.

630
00:52:22,786 --> 00:52:24,720
l don't know how she
must be going through it.

631
00:52:27,524 --> 00:52:28,582
Excuse me.

632
00:52:28,926 --> 00:52:29,984
Hello.

633
00:52:30,661 --> 00:52:31,923
Yes, l will just send the file.

634
00:52:34,264 --> 00:52:35,322
l'll just be back.

635
00:52:43,407 --> 00:52:44,465
Wow!

636
00:52:44,541 --> 00:52:45,599
Lovely weather!

637
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:48,275
ln such weather, men
want only two things.

638
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,337
A cold beer and a hot babe.

639
00:52:52,015 --> 00:52:55,883
l have already told you, l
don't mix business with pleasure.

640
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,282
l am not talking about myself.

641
00:52:59,289 --> 00:53:01,018
Tonight you will
have to go to Ranvir.

642
00:53:03,494 --> 00:53:05,826
And this time, it's purely business.

643
00:53:24,448 --> 00:53:25,506
Good boy.

644
00:54:07,891 --> 00:54:08,949
What are you doing here?

645
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,623
l want to talk to you
urgently about Rajiv.

646
00:54:14,364 --> 00:54:16,025
Sonia, don't misunderstand Rajiv.

647
00:54:17,634 --> 00:54:18,896
He loves you a lot.

648
00:54:22,573 --> 00:54:25,974
Rajiv loves only
alcohol and no one else.

649
00:54:28,779 --> 00:54:30,371
ln the last 15 days,
there has been..

650
00:54:30,447 --> 00:54:32,381
..no relationship between us..

651
00:54:32,449 --> 00:54:34,383
..which a husband and wife have.

652
00:54:36,587 --> 00:54:37,849
You have ruined my life, Ranvir.

653
00:54:39,389 --> 00:54:41,448
Why did you hide from me
that your brother is a drunkard?

654
00:54:44,461 --> 00:54:49,398
lf l had known, that
he will break his oath..

655
00:54:49,466 --> 00:54:53,402
..then, my love..
- You loved me.

656
00:54:55,405 --> 00:54:56,463
How nice.

657
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:58,732
She is acting better than me.

658
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:02,135
Why.. why did you hide it?

659
00:55:03,146 --> 00:55:04,408
Why?

660
00:55:06,883 --> 00:55:11,013
l am sorry Sonia, l
made a terrible mistake.

661
00:55:11,755 --> 00:55:13,814
l am paying for your mistake!

662
00:55:18,428 --> 00:55:19,486
l need you.

663
00:55:53,196 --> 00:55:54,458
What an era!

664
00:55:55,465 --> 00:55:56,523
Marriage with the younger brother..

665
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,932
..and the wedding night,
with the elder brother.

666
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:41,568
Cheers!

667
00:56:47,784 --> 00:56:50,514
Ranvir, my granny says..

668
00:56:50,587 --> 00:56:54,523
..a girl is lucky, when people
think about her in her absence too.

669
00:56:55,792 --> 00:56:57,521
And she's is unlucky, when
people think about something else..

670
00:56:57,594 --> 00:56:59,653
..even her presence.

671
00:57:01,531 --> 00:57:02,589
And l think l am unlucky.

672
00:57:03,667 --> 00:57:04,725
Why do you say that?

673
00:57:05,135 --> 00:57:07,535
Because l thought, being with me..

674
00:57:07,604 --> 00:57:11,540
..you will forget all
your problems and tensions.

675
00:57:12,542 --> 00:57:13,600
But you..

676
00:57:16,012 --> 00:57:19,072
Tell me. How do you find me?

677
00:57:22,152 --> 00:57:25,553
You are the closest to me.

678
00:57:27,557 --> 00:57:28,956
l don't know what l
would do without you.

679
00:57:31,561 --> 00:57:32,619
Really?

680
00:57:32,829 --> 00:57:33,955
You've made my evening.

681
00:57:34,564 --> 00:57:36,759
lt felt very nice to
hear what you said.

682
00:57:37,567 --> 00:57:40,764
But it would have felt
better if you would have said it..

683
00:57:42,172 --> 00:57:43,230
What?

684
00:57:46,576 --> 00:57:47,634
Touch!

685
00:58:06,596 --> 00:58:08,655
O slowly, touch me!
Touch me! Touch me!

686
00:58:08,932 --> 00:58:11,594
O slowly, kiss me!
Kiss me! Kiss me!

00:58:11,668 --> 00:58:13,932
O slowly hold me!
Hold me! Hold me!

688
00:58:14,004 --> 00:58:15,665
O slowly..

Touch me! Touch me! Touch me!

690
00:58:19,209 --> 00:58:21,677
O slowly, kiss me!
Kiss me! Kiss me!

691
00:58:21,745 --> 00:58:24,213
O slowly hold me!
Hold me! Hold me!

692
00:58:24,281 --> 00:58:25,680
O slowly..

693
00:58:27,884 --> 00:58:30,614
Without you my beloved,
in this world..

694
00:58:30,687 --> 00:58:33,019
..l am all alone.

695
00:58:33,089 --> 00:58:34,613
Without you my beloved,

00:58:34,691 --> 00:58:36,955
..l am all alone.

00:58:37,627 --> 00:58:39,686
O slowly, touch me!
Touch me! Touch me!

O slowly, kiss me!
Kiss me! Kiss me!

00:58:42,632 --> 00:58:44,827
O slowly, hold me!
Hold me! Hold me!

700
00:58:44,901 --> 00:58:46,698
O slowly..

00:58:48,638 --> 00:58:50,037
Touch me! Touch me! Touch me!

702
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,834
O slowly, kiss me!
Kiss me! Kiss me!

703
00:58:52,909 --> 00:58:55,241
O slowly, hold me!
Hold me! Hold me!

704
00:58:55,312 --> 00:58:56,711
O slowly..

705
00:59:30,013 --> 00:59:32,345
l am waiting only for you.

706
00:59:32,682 --> 00:59:35,014
l love only you.

707
00:59:35,218 --> 00:59:37,277
You have put me on a high.

708
00:59:37,687 --> 00:59:40,087
l don't have any
control on myself.

709
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:42,758
l am waiting only for you.

710
00:59:42,826 --> 00:59:45,226
l love only you.

711
00:59:45,695 --> 00:59:47,890
l am restless for you.

712
00:59:47,964 --> 00:59:50,432
l don't have any
control on myself.

713
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:53,692
Without you my beloved,
in this world..

714
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:55,761
..l am all alone.

715
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:58,239
Without you my beloved,
in this world..

716
00:59:58,308 --> 00:59:59,775
..l am all alone.

717
01:00:01,044 --> 01:00:02,443

Hold me! Hold me!

720
01:00:07,784 --> 01:00:08,910
O slowly..

721
01:00:32,075 --> 01:00:34,805
The pain doesn't lessen.

722
01:00:34,878 --> 01:00:37,073
The distance troubles me.

723
01:00:37,147 --> 01:00:39,741
l might lose control.

724
01:00:39,816 --> 01:00:42,148
You are under my oath.

725
01:00:42,352 --> 01:00:44,820
The pain doesn't lessen.

726
01:00:44,888 --> 01:00:47,288
The distance troubles me.

727
01:00:47,757 --> 01:00:49,816
l might lose control.

728
01:00:49,893 --> 01:00:52,487
You are under my oath.

729
01:00:52,762 --> 01:00:55,754
Without you my beloved,
in this world..

730
01:00:55,832 --> 01:00:57,766
..l am all alone.

731
01:00:57,834 --> 01:01:00,166
Without you my beloved,
in this world..

732
01:01:00,236 --> 01:01:01,760
..l am all alone.

733
01:01:02,839 --> 01:01:04,306
Touch me! Touch me! Touch me!

734
01:01:04,774 --> 01:01:06,969
O slowly, kiss me!
Kiss me! Kiss me!

735
01:01:07,177 --> 01:01:09,771
O slowly, hold me!
Hold me! Hold me!

736
01:01:09,846 --> 01:01:10,972
O slowly..

737
01:01:13,116 --> 01:01:15,778
Without you my beloved,
in this world..

738
01:01:15,852 --> 01:01:18,184
..l am all alone.

739
01:01:18,254 --> 01:01:20,779
Without you my beloved,
in this world..

740
01:01:20,857 --> 01:01:22,188
..l am all alone.

741
01:01:23,326 --> 01:01:25,794
Without you my beloved,
in this world..

742
01:01:25,862 --> 01:01:27,193
..l am all alone.

743
01:01:28,198 --> 01:01:29,859
Without you..

744
01:01:41,011 --> 01:01:42,069
Why have you come here?

745
01:01:42,212 --> 01:01:43,338
l was missing you.

746
01:01:44,147 --> 01:01:45,808
Listen to me, forget
everything that happened yesterday..

747
01:01:45,882 --> 01:01:48,350
..it was a mistake.

748
01:01:48,418 --> 01:01:51,546
Mistake! We love each other.

749
01:01:51,821 --> 01:01:52,879
We used to!

750
01:01:52,956 --> 01:01:54,890
Whatever happened, it's over.

751
01:01:55,225 --> 01:01:59,423
Ronny, l want to live with
you and not your brother.

752
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:02,357
Please tell him
about our relationship.

753
01:02:02,832 --> 01:02:05,164
l will divorce him and
we will get married.

754
01:02:05,235 --> 01:02:06,361
Are you out of your mind?

755
01:02:06,836 --> 01:02:07,894
That's not possible!

756
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:14,438
Fine! lf you can't tell him,
then l will tell him.

757
01:02:16,446 --> 01:02:17,913
You won't do anything like that!

758
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:34,988
What next?

759
01:02:38,001 --> 01:02:42,404
The gun is ready. All we
need to do is press the trigger.

760
01:02:56,219 --> 01:02:58,084
Ronny, l am going to
kill that lowly man!

761
01:02:58,288 --> 01:02:59,949
l swear to God, l am
going to kill him!

762
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:01,948
What's the matter Rajiv?

763
01:03:03,293 --> 01:03:04,351
Whom are you talking about?

764
01:03:05,228 --> 01:03:07,958
Sonia! She is having
an affair with someone.

765
01:03:12,902 --> 01:03:14,096
l will kill that dirty woman!

766
01:03:15,305 --> 01:03:21,301
That's ridiculous Rajiv!
Sonia is not like that.

767
01:03:21,377 --> 01:03:22,435
lt's a fact!

768
01:03:23,046 --> 01:03:25,105
She slyly goes to
meet someone everyday.

769
01:03:26,983 --> 01:03:28,314
Last night, she
returned at 2 o'clock.

770
01:03:29,319 --> 01:03:30,911
When l asked, she
said wherever l go..

771
01:03:30,987 --> 01:03:32,511
..whomever l meet, what's it to you?

772
01:03:33,389 --> 01:03:35,983
Rajiv, can l say something?

773
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:41,458
Before accusing Sonia, think
of what you have done with her.

774
01:03:42,065 --> 01:03:43,999
lt has been so many
days since your marriage.

775
01:03:44,467 --> 01:03:48,665
Have you given her a
single moment of happiness?

776
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:51,998
What are you talking about?

777
01:03:52,542 --> 01:03:54,942
l am a woman, that's
why l can tell you..

778
01:03:55,011 --> 01:03:58,003
..she is doing all this
to grab your attention.

779
01:03:59,015 --> 01:04:00,346
And you are suspecting her.

780
01:04:01,351 --> 01:04:02,477
lt's all nonsense.

781
01:04:03,353 --> 01:04:05,548
l know she is having an affair.

782
01:04:06,356 --> 01:04:08,153
And l will surely catch that man!

783
01:04:34,317 --> 01:04:35,579
Sonia, good that you have come.

784
01:04:36,052 --> 01:04:37,519
l am very confused.

785
01:04:38,121 --> 01:04:40,055
Tell me, which one
is the best photo.

786
01:04:41,391 --> 01:04:43,586
After Ranvir's death, we will
have to give it in the newspapers.

787
01:04:44,394 --> 01:04:48,387
Dear brother, we
will never forget you.

788
01:04:49,332 --> 01:04:50,390
All that will be later.

789
01:04:51,134 --> 01:04:52,396
But how will we kill Ranvir?

790
01:04:53,002 --> 01:04:54,060
What are you saying?

791
01:04:55,004 --> 01:04:56,403
l will kill my elder brother.

792
01:04:57,540 --> 01:05:00,532
l want the 100 million of
the insurance money, fool.

793
01:05:01,477 --> 01:05:03,069
Brother will have to
die in an accident.

794
01:05:03,346 --> 01:05:04,404
But how?

795
01:05:06,216 --> 01:05:07,274
You want to know my plan?

796
01:05:08,418 --> 01:05:09,476
Actually it's very simple.

797
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:13,014
The day brother
returns from Cape Town..

798
01:05:13,089 --> 01:05:16,024
..l will go the terrace
of the office building..

799
01:05:16,092 --> 01:05:17,354
..to commit suicide.

800
01:05:18,561 --> 01:05:21,428
And exactly at 6:30,
l will call him..

801
01:05:23,099 --> 01:05:26,034
..and tell him,
brother l have found out..

802
01:05:26,102 --> 01:05:30,095
..that my wife is
having an affair with you.

803
01:05:31,374 --> 01:05:34,502
And to clear your path,
l am committing suicide.

804
01:05:35,578 --> 01:05:37,239
That poor guy loves me a lot.

805
01:05:38,181 --> 01:05:41,776
He will instantly come
running to the terrace to save me.

806
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:45,053
And when he tries to save me..

807
01:05:45,388 --> 01:05:48,255
..you will push him from the back.

808
01:05:49,392 --> 01:05:51,121
He will lose his balance and..

809
01:05:54,597 --> 01:05:56,462
And our bank balance.

810
01:05:59,602 --> 01:06:00,660
lt's a brilliant plan.

811
01:06:01,404 --> 01:06:03,133
First marriage with
the brother's girlfriend.

812
01:06:03,206 --> 01:06:04,673
Then put a charade of
being drunk all the time.

813
01:06:05,074 --> 01:06:07,269
Then your wife's
affair with your brother.

814
01:06:08,077 --> 01:06:09,601
And then in the end, a
charade of committing suicide.

815
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:11,137
And then an accident.

816
01:06:16,152 --> 01:06:17,278
lt's a brilliant plan.

817
01:06:20,089 --> 01:06:22,489
Rajiv has taken care of
all the minor details.

818
01:06:25,161 --> 01:06:26,492
But he has forgotten one thing.

819
01:06:28,097 --> 01:06:29,155
l am his elder brother.

820
01:06:30,099 --> 01:06:31,498
So what is your plan now?

821
01:06:31,567 --> 01:06:33,694
Rajiv has worked
hard over this plan.

822
01:06:35,438 --> 01:06:37,497
l don't want to hurt
him by changing the plan.

823
01:06:40,109 --> 01:06:41,701
The plan will remain the same.

824
01:06:44,113 --> 01:06:45,171
There will be a minor change.

825
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:53,648
l won't die, he will.

826
01:07:00,663 --> 01:07:01,721
Yes, this is Ranvir speaking.

827
01:07:03,132 --> 01:07:06,329
l want to meet you.

828
01:07:21,484 --> 01:07:23,543
What is the status of the
flight arriving from Cape Town?

829
01:07:31,627 --> 01:07:32,685
Thank you.

830
01:07:34,497 --> 01:07:35,896
Ranvir's flight has landed.

831
01:07:38,634 --> 01:07:39,760
The countdown begins.

832
01:07:57,387 --> 01:08:00,185
The three days l spent
with you in Cape Town..

833
01:08:00,256 --> 01:08:01,848
..l will never forget them.

834
01:08:03,326 --> 01:08:04,918
They were the most
wonderful days of my life.

835
01:08:06,396 --> 01:08:07,454
Same here.

836
01:08:09,198 --> 01:08:10,722
Bye.

837
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:24,537
Very punctual.

838
01:08:26,215 --> 01:08:27,273
Hello brother.

839
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:28,817
Ronny, you filthy man!

840
01:08:29,552 --> 01:08:31,952
You are the one having
an affair with Sonia!

841
01:08:32,622 --> 01:08:35,614
l've found out! lt's you, you fool!

842
01:08:37,293 --> 01:08:39,955
Listen Rajiv, it's not
what you think it is.

843
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:41,961
l can explain everything.

844
01:08:42,365 --> 01:08:43,423
Where are you?

845
01:08:43,499 --> 01:08:45,296
On the office terrace you fool!

846
01:08:48,504 --> 01:08:49,766
l am about to jump from here!

847
01:08:51,574 --> 01:08:52,836
l am going to commit suicide!

848
01:08:53,242 --> 01:08:56,439
Look Rajiv, you are surely mistaken.

849
01:08:56,512 --> 01:08:58,776
Keep quiet! l am mistaken!

850
01:08:59,649 --> 01:09:01,310
Sonia told me this herself!

851
01:09:02,518 --> 01:09:06,852
Why are you telling this? Sonia is
your wife. She loves you very much.

852
01:09:07,857 --> 01:09:10,325
Aren't you ashamed of
sleeping with your brother's wife?

853
01:09:11,527 --> 01:09:13,859
l couldn't even think
you would deceive me.

854
01:09:14,263 --> 01:09:15,662
Don't be mad.

855
01:09:16,466 --> 01:09:18,661
Stay there, l am coming.

856
01:09:18,868 --> 01:09:20,460
There is no need to come!

857
01:09:21,471 --> 01:09:22,665
What explanation will you give?

858
01:09:22,738 --> 01:09:24,000
That you made a mistake?

859
01:09:25,274 --> 01:09:30,678
The only thing l regret, Ronny, is
that my own brother deceived me!

860
01:09:30,746 --> 01:09:32,338
No Rajiv, that's not true.

861
01:09:32,415 --> 01:09:35,350
You cheated me, backstabbed me.

862
01:09:36,285 --> 01:09:38,344
Now, l have got nothing to live for.

863
01:09:38,421 --> 01:09:39,683
Listen to me, Rajiv.

864
01:09:42,825 --> 01:09:44,349
l know l have made a mistake.

865
01:09:44,427 --> 01:09:45,485
Mistake!

866
01:09:45,561 --> 01:09:48,291
Sleeping with your
younger brother's wife..

867
01:09:48,364 --> 01:09:50,628
..is just a mistake for you?

868
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,702
What?

869
01:09:56,839 --> 01:09:58,500
You said she is a
good friend of yours!

870
01:09:59,909 --> 01:10:02,309
You should've told me if
you liked her so much..

871
01:10:02,378 --> 01:10:03,902
..l wouldn't have married her.

872
01:10:04,647 --> 01:10:05,705
First get down from here.

873
01:10:06,849 --> 01:10:07,907
Then l will explain everything.

874
01:11:09,712 --> 01:11:10,770
l still love you Ronny.

875
01:11:11,781 --> 01:11:14,045
But 20 million dollars
is a very big amount.

876
01:11:14,784 --> 01:11:15,842
l am sorry.

877
01:11:18,387 --> 01:11:19,979
l guess this is where
we say goodbye, Ronny.

878
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:50,214
Mini! RD's assistant!
She is good at office work!

879
01:11:50,883 --> 01:11:52,874
But she doesn't
understand RD's feelings.

880
01:11:56,822 --> 01:11:57,880
RD!

881
01:11:58,223 --> 01:12:00,282
lnspector Robert D'costa!

882
01:12:05,697 --> 01:12:06,891
Now we will have fun!

883
01:12:10,235 --> 01:12:13,693
Welcome, sir! Welcome! We
were waiting for you, sir!

884
01:12:13,772 --> 01:12:14,830
Are you inviting me just like that..

885
01:12:14,907 --> 01:12:15,965
..or is somebody getting married..

886
01:12:16,041 --> 01:12:17,838
..and you've
called me here to dance?

887
01:12:18,243 --> 01:12:20,711
No, sir. Actually it's the
lndian community's case..

888
01:12:20,779 --> 01:12:23,714
..so we were 100 per cent sure that
the department will send you, sir.

889
01:12:25,717 --> 01:12:26,775
First, tell me.

890
01:12:26,852 --> 01:12:27,910
Yes, sir.

891
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:29,246
What about Alfonso mangoes?

892
01:12:29,721 --> 01:12:30,779
Alfonso?

893
01:12:31,256 --> 01:12:34,248
Yes. You were going to get
Alfonso mangoes for me from lndia!

894
01:12:34,326 --> 01:12:35,384
What about that?

895
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:36,722
l forgot, sir!

896
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:39,791
You all don't pay
attention to your work!

897
01:12:39,865 --> 01:12:42,925
How will you get promoted?
Spoilt my mood!

898
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:46,799
From which floor did
he do the high jump?

899
01:12:47,139 --> 01:12:48,197
Sir, from 20th floor.

900
01:12:48,273 --> 01:12:52,209
Great! People jump from a
height to reach to the moon.

901
01:12:52,277 --> 01:12:53,403
He went further away!

902
01:12:54,279 --> 01:12:55,337
Why did he commit suicide?

903
01:12:55,747 --> 01:12:57,942
Sir, actually it's not a
suicide but an accident case.

904
01:12:58,016 --> 01:12:59,074
Any eyewitness?

905
01:12:59,151 --> 01:13:00,743
The victim's brother
and sister-in-law!

906
01:13:00,819 --> 01:13:02,753
lt means when he was
falling from above..

907
01:13:02,821 --> 01:13:03,879
..his brother and sister-in-law
were bidding him farewell!

908
01:13:03,956 --> 01:13:05,014
Sir, l don't know.

909
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:06,216
But they both are
still upstairs, sir.

910
01:13:06,291 --> 01:13:07,349
Then what are we doing downstairs?

911
01:13:07,426 --> 01:13:08,484
Waiting for them to fall?

912
01:13:09,027 --> 01:13:11,495
Let's go, Mini.
Let's interrogate them.

913
01:13:12,297 --> 01:13:14,288
Maybe they've ordered
Alfonso mangoes from lndia.

914
01:13:14,766 --> 01:13:15,824
Come on. Let's go.

915
01:13:24,176 --> 01:13:27,373
Sir, he is Mr. Rajiv
Singh and his wife Sonia.

916
01:13:27,779 --> 01:13:28,837
Okay. Go.

917
01:13:30,182 --> 01:13:33,310
Hi! l am RD. Robert D'costa.

918
01:13:34,786 --> 01:13:37,778
l am the investigating
officer of this case..

919
01:13:37,856 --> 01:13:39,790
..and she is my assistant Mini.

920
01:13:42,261 --> 01:13:44,320
l want to ask you a few questions.

921
01:13:47,132 --> 01:13:48,190
Go ahead.

922
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,859
Can you tell me how
this accident took place?

923
01:13:51,336 --> 01:13:55,204
This was not an accident.
l killed my brother.

924
01:13:56,341 --> 01:13:58,206
Everything happened because of me.

925
01:14:00,412 --> 01:14:02,209
Relax, Mr. Rajiv. Cool down.

926
01:14:05,217 --> 01:14:07,879
Thank you. Will you have it?

927
01:14:07,953 --> 01:14:09,011
No. You drink it.

928
01:14:09,354 --> 01:14:10,821
l should be thanking you.

929
01:14:10,889 --> 01:14:12,823
You accepted your crime so quickly.

930
01:14:14,359 --> 01:14:17,886
Officer, this is not
what my husband meant.

931
01:14:19,431 --> 01:14:22,423
Actually he is an alcoholic.

932
01:14:23,168 --> 01:14:27,298
He thinks his drinking habit is
responsible for his brother's death.

933
01:14:28,507 --> 01:14:29,565
lt was an accident.

934
01:14:30,242 --> 01:14:34,838
Sir, if his wife had not been here,
he'd have been hanged.

935
01:14:36,048 --> 01:14:38,380
Absolutely right! He
escaped because of his wife.

936
01:14:39,117 --> 01:14:40,846
Often, people die
because of their wife.

937
01:14:41,386 --> 01:14:42,444
Look, Mr. Rajiv.

938
01:14:43,855 --> 01:14:46,847
lf you think that your
brother's death was an accident..

939
01:14:46,925 --> 01:14:49,120
..then how is it
connected to your drinking?

940
01:14:50,262 --> 01:14:51,854
Because of my bad habit of betting..

941
01:14:53,465 --> 01:14:55,399
..Ranvir had incurred a
heavy loss in business.

942
01:14:56,068 --> 01:14:57,933
He had to mortgage his ranch house.

943
01:14:58,470 --> 01:15:00,870
And he had to sell Cape
Town's ancestral property too.

944
01:15:02,407 --> 01:15:04,068
Because of that depression,
l started drinking a lot.

945
01:15:07,412 --> 01:15:09,471
l thought that l am
responsible for all our problems.

946
01:15:12,417 --> 01:15:14,408
So l decided to commit suicide.

947
01:15:19,024 --> 01:15:21,891
At the last moment..
at the last moment..

948
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:24,087
..Ranvir came to save me.

949
01:15:25,297 --> 01:15:28,289
Unfortunately he lost his balance.

950
01:15:28,367 --> 01:15:30,494
And he fell down.

951
01:15:32,637 --> 01:15:35,902
Sir, the man who
wanted to die, survived..

952
01:15:35,974 --> 01:15:39,967
..and the man who had
come to save him, died!

953
01:15:40,912 --> 01:15:41,970
That's strange!

954
01:15:43,315 --> 01:15:45,909
Mini, l've told you many times..

955
01:15:45,984 --> 01:15:48,111
..not to talk strangely
in front of strangers.

956
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:49,578
Do it when you are alone.

957
01:15:50,255 --> 01:15:51,984
Just now he lost his brother.

958
01:15:52,924 --> 01:15:54,983
You are hurting his feelings
more by talking like this.

959
01:15:57,529 --> 01:15:58,587
Sorry, Mr. Rajiv.

960
01:15:59,931 --> 01:16:02,991
My assistant is not
intelligent like your wife.

961
01:16:03,468 --> 01:16:04,992
l can understand what
you are going through.

962
01:16:05,937 --> 01:16:08,337
lt's quite late. Go and rest.

963
01:16:10,542 --> 01:16:11,600
Come.

964
01:16:15,547 --> 01:16:20,541
l hope it had happened
as you said, Mr. Rajiv.

965
01:16:21,153 --> 01:16:22,211
Let's go, Mini.

966
01:16:32,497 --> 01:16:34,692
Mini, hearing him what did
you feel? Where's the bag gone?

967
01:16:35,367 --> 01:16:36,425
You know sir?
- Yes.

968
01:16:36,501 --> 01:16:40,164
l remembered my uncle. He
died due to drinking too.

969
01:16:40,505 --> 01:16:41,631
He used to drink a lot?

970
01:16:42,174 --> 01:16:45,166
No, sir. A liquor
drum fell on his head!

971
01:16:46,378 --> 01:16:50,508
l have observed that liquor
kills non-drinkers and not drinkers.

972
01:16:50,582 --> 01:16:51,981
Mini, l was asking
you if you thought..

973
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:54,314
..he was lying or telling the truth?

974
01:16:54,586 --> 01:16:55,644
The truth, sir.

975
01:16:55,987 --> 01:16:57,045
You thought he was lying?

976
01:16:57,122 --> 01:16:59,989
Mini, the first rule
of investigation is..

977
01:17:00,058 --> 01:17:02,185
..not to trust your eyes and ears.

978
01:17:02,394 --> 01:17:04,385
Just trust your mind.

979
01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:07,394
Sir, it means you don't
think it was an accident?

980
01:17:07,999 --> 01:17:09,990
Where there is big
money involved, baby..

981
01:17:10,068 --> 01:17:12,059
..accidents are waiting to happen!

982
01:17:12,537 --> 01:17:15,734
Correct! But why
didn't l understand that?

983
01:17:16,007 --> 01:17:17,406
Because there is a problem with you.

984
01:17:18,009 --> 01:17:19,067
What, sir?

985
01:17:21,413 --> 01:17:22,607
l will tell you some other time.

986
01:17:23,014 --> 01:17:25,005
Listen. By tomorrow morning..

987
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:27,415
..l want Sonia's,
Ranvir's and Rajiv's biography.

988
01:17:27,486 --> 01:17:29,545
Now hold this banana
and get in the car.

989
01:17:29,621 --> 01:17:31,418
l will eat it
peacefully inside. Come on!

990
01:17:40,432 --> 01:17:42,764
Come! Come, Mr. Rajiv. Come!

991
01:17:44,369 --> 01:17:45,427
Will you have sugarcane?

992
01:17:47,239 --> 01:17:48,638
Actually this is to be sucked on.

993
01:17:48,707 --> 01:17:52,108
But it doesn't feel right
to ask if you'll suck on it.

994
01:17:54,579 --> 01:17:58,447
lnspector, what was the need to
call me for body identification?

995
01:17:59,451 --> 01:18:02,045
l know that this accident
took place in front of you..

996
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:04,111
..but we have to
follow the procedure.

997
01:18:33,418 --> 01:18:34,476
lsn't he your brother?

998
01:18:35,554 --> 01:18:36,612
Yes.

999
01:18:37,289 --> 01:18:39,484
You both are really strong.

1000
01:18:40,292 --> 01:18:43,090
Generally people either
faint or turn their face..

1001
01:18:43,161 --> 01:18:44,219
..after such a sight.

1002
01:18:44,496 --> 01:18:46,157
We have to be strong.

1003
01:18:47,432 --> 01:18:50,492
Now he has to look after the
office, house, everything.

1004
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:56,498
That's right.

1005
01:19:01,112 --> 01:19:02,511
When can we claim the body?

1006
01:19:03,315 --> 01:19:04,509
Until the investigation is over..

1007
01:19:04,583 --> 01:19:06,448
..we can't give you the body.

1008
01:19:07,118 --> 01:19:08,517
Go to the office, l'll come there.

1009
01:19:09,521 --> 01:19:11,182
l want to interrogate your staff.

1010
01:19:14,459 --> 01:19:15,517
Come.

1011
01:19:20,465 --> 01:19:22,660
Sir, you are very strong.

1012
01:19:23,134 --> 01:19:26,126
You are having
sugarcane at such a time!

1013
01:19:26,204 --> 01:19:27,535
What has strength got to do with it?

1014
01:19:28,206 --> 01:19:30,538
The dead body won't
take my sugarcane!

1015
01:19:31,142 --> 01:19:35,670
My heart is still beating fast.

1016
01:19:36,147 --> 01:19:38,741
ls that so? Let me see.

1017
01:19:40,151 --> 01:19:41,675
Sir, what's the time?

1018
01:19:42,487 --> 01:19:43,545
Why?

1019
01:19:43,622 --> 01:19:45,681
Sir, we have to go
to Rajiv's office.

1020
01:19:47,158 --> 01:19:49,217
Mini, there won't be any
good time in your life.

1021
01:19:49,628 --> 01:19:50,686
Why, sir?

1022
01:19:50,762 --> 01:19:53,230
l told you. There is
a problem with you.

1023
01:19:53,498 --> 01:19:54,556
What, sir?

1024
01:19:54,633 --> 01:19:59,161
l will tell you some other time.
Have this. l mean let's go.

1025
01:20:01,506 --> 01:20:02,837
Now what do l tell you, sir?

1026
01:20:03,642 --> 01:20:06,167
Mr. Ranvir was a great man, sir.

1027
01:20:07,178 --> 01:20:09,237
He didn't differentiate
between humans and animals.

1028
01:20:10,181 --> 01:20:13,241
He loved humans as much
as he loved animals, sir.

1029
01:20:14,185 --> 01:20:17,712
l still don't believe
that Mr. Ranvir is no more.

1030
01:20:20,458 --> 01:20:21,516
Why are you crying?

1031
01:20:22,594 --> 01:20:26,655
Sir, you peeled the orange.
lts juice got into my eyes.

1032
01:20:27,666 --> 01:20:28,724
The next question.

1033
01:20:29,534 --> 01:20:31,263
How was the relationship
between Rajiv and Ranvir?

1034
01:20:31,936 --> 01:20:35,929
Sir! Sir! They could even lay
down their lives for each other.

1035
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:40,203
They were like Bharat and Ram, sir.

1036
01:20:40,545 --> 01:20:42,274
lt means both were step-brothers.

1037
01:20:42,347 --> 01:20:43,746
Yes, sir. Both were step-brothers.

1038
01:20:44,616 --> 01:20:46,811
Sir, were Bharat and
Ram step-brothers too?

1039
01:20:49,487 --> 01:20:50,545
Yes.

1040
01:20:50,822 --> 01:20:54,622
Sir.. do you want to ask
me any other question?

1041
01:20:55,226 --> 01:20:58,889
Orange is over. End of
interrogation. Give me.

1042
01:21:01,232 --> 01:21:02,290
Sir, you are a genius.

1043
01:21:02,634 --> 01:21:04,226
You asked as many questions..

1044
01:21:04,302 --> 01:21:05,633
..as the orange slices.

1045
01:21:07,238 --> 01:21:08,296
Can l get a pomegranate?

1046
01:21:08,373 --> 01:21:09,431
Yes.

1047
01:21:16,581 --> 01:21:18,310
Sir's 2-3 questions fell down.

1048
01:21:19,584 --> 01:21:20,642
Officers.

1049
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:21,777
Search..

1050
01:21:21,853 --> 01:21:23,650
..every corner of this office. Okay?

1051
01:21:25,256 --> 01:21:26,587
Okay. Thank you.

1052
01:21:41,272 --> 01:21:42,330
May l come in?

1053
01:21:43,274 --> 01:21:44,332
Come.

1054
01:21:44,409 --> 01:21:45,467
Thank you so much.

1055
01:21:46,010 --> 01:21:48,604
Mr. Rajiv, l have completed my
interrogation with your staff.

1056
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:52,477
And l am 99 percent satisfied.
Pomegranate?

1057
01:21:54,285 --> 01:21:56,480
lt means you still
have 1 percent doubt.

1058
01:21:57,288 --> 01:22:01,281
Yes. Whenever a big property
is involved or when money..

1059
01:22:01,359 --> 01:22:06,296
..is involved, l don't
know why l feel suspicious.

1060
01:22:08,566 --> 01:22:10,295
The ranch house
you are thinking of..

1061
01:22:10,368 --> 01:22:11,699
..is mortgaged with the bank.

1062
01:22:14,305 --> 01:22:18,298
l know. But l am talking
about Ranvir's insurance policy..

1063
01:22:18,376 --> 01:22:21,834
..which will give you 100 million.

1064
01:22:26,651 --> 01:22:32,317
lnspector, my father had an
insurance policy in both our names.

1065
01:22:32,857 --> 01:22:35,917
l had forgotten about this.

1066
01:22:38,463 --> 01:22:41,523
l am eating pomegranate so
do you think l'm a fool?

1067
01:22:44,335 --> 01:22:47,930
You must have
thought of the policy once!

1068
01:22:50,341 --> 01:22:51,399
What are you trying to say?

1069
01:22:54,345 --> 01:22:55,539
Look, l am not accusing you.

1070
01:22:59,684 --> 01:23:01,413
lf you felt bad about it..

1071
01:23:02,487 --> 01:23:03,545
..then l am sorry.

1072
01:23:08,693 --> 01:23:09,751
Lowly man!

1073
01:23:10,695 --> 01:23:11,753
Did you say anything?

1074
01:23:14,365 --> 01:23:15,423
No.

1075
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:18,367
You see, whenever l
interrogate somebody..

1076
01:23:18,436 --> 01:23:20,370
..people often call me a lowly man.

1077
01:23:20,905 --> 01:23:21,963
But l don't mind.

1078
01:23:22,373 --> 01:23:26,104
But where crime is concerned,
l am a lowly man.

1079
01:23:33,918 --> 01:23:36,580
Such a big incident
occurred and nobody informed me!

1080
01:23:37,388 --> 01:23:39,447
Why didn't anybody inform me?

1081
01:23:40,992 --> 01:23:42,789
Why didn't you tell me anything?

1082
01:23:44,929 --> 01:23:46,794
Why don't you people say something?

1083
01:23:48,399 --> 01:23:51,459
Listen! Come here! Who is she?

1084
01:23:52,804 --> 01:23:54,795
She is Sophia ma'am,
Mr. Ranvir's secretary.

1085
01:23:57,742 --> 01:23:59,004
Being a secretary why
is she crying so much?

1086
01:23:59,944 --> 01:24:01,935
How did all this happen?

1087
01:24:03,014 --> 01:24:05,949
Excuse me. l am RD.

1088
01:24:07,619 --> 01:24:09,018
The investigating
officer of this case.

1089
01:24:10,755 --> 01:24:12,484
l regret your boss' death.

1090
01:24:13,825 --> 01:24:19,024
Boss? He was not my boss.
He was my husband.

1091
01:24:24,969 --> 01:24:26,027
Husband?

1092
01:24:32,043 --> 01:24:35,035
What are you saying?
When did you marry Ranvir?

1093
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:39,438
When we went to Cape Town,
we got married there.

1094
01:24:41,452 --> 01:24:44,444
We were going to
throw a surprise bash..

1095
01:24:44,522 --> 01:24:45,580
..and give this news to everybody.

1096
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:52,588
Ms. Sophia, l want to ask
you a few questions alone.

1097
01:24:53,531 --> 01:24:54,998
Come with me. Come.

1098
01:25:06,010 --> 01:25:09,605
Can you tell me in detail
how this happened suddenly?

1099
01:25:12,483 --> 01:25:14,883
Ranvir was dependent on
me since the beginning.

1100
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:18,215
He would tell me all his problems.

1101
01:25:20,491 --> 01:25:22,550
l too liked his company.

1102
01:25:24,829 --> 01:25:27,491
He was depressed for
the past 3 months..

1103
01:25:27,565 --> 01:25:28,691
..because of his brother.

1104
01:25:30,501 --> 01:25:35,029
We had to go to Cape Town to
sell Ranvir's ancestral property.

1105
01:25:37,508 --> 01:25:38,566
Hi!
- Hi!

1106
01:25:38,643 --> 01:25:40,577
There the estate agent
introduced us to the client.

1107
01:25:41,512 --> 01:25:43,571
He wanted to buy this property.

1108
01:25:44,849 --> 01:25:45,907
The deal was fixed.

1109
01:25:47,118 --> 01:25:50,053
The client asked for 2
days to make the payment.

1110
01:25:51,856 --> 01:25:53,585
That day we both were free.

1111
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:57,594
We spent these 2 days together.

1112
01:25:58,930 --> 01:26:00,261
Ranvir was really happy.

1113
01:26:01,866 --> 01:26:04,733
l felt as if he had
forgotten all his problems.

1114
01:26:07,739 --> 01:26:09,604
That day, Ranvir proposed to me.

1115
01:26:28,559 --> 01:26:30,754
Showing me fake dreams..

1116
01:26:30,828 --> 01:26:35,822
..he bluffs. My foolish,
deceiving beloved.

1117
01:26:37,168 --> 01:26:39,568
Showing me fake dreams..

1118
01:26:39,637 --> 01:26:44,973
..he bluffs. My foolish,
deceiving beloved.

1119
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:48,970
Hey, mister. You say
you want me as your lover.

1120
01:26:49,047 --> 01:26:51,174
But tell me now are you a player?

1121
01:26:51,916 --> 01:26:53,178
Say what?

1122
01:26:55,186 --> 01:26:59,987
Whenever l see you, l get wounded.

1123
01:27:03,995 --> 01:27:10,332
You are in my heart and in
my every breath, beloved.

1124
01:27:12,603 --> 01:27:16,334
What spell has my
beloved cast on me?

1125
01:27:16,941 --> 01:27:18,670
Love is the game l want to play.

1126
01:27:18,743 --> 01:27:21,610
l am craving for your body now.

1127
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:23,670
Showing me fake dreams..

1128
01:27:23,748 --> 01:27:28,617
..he bluffs. My foolish,
deceiving beloved.

1129
01:27:28,686 --> 01:27:30,210
Give me all the love now.

1130
01:27:30,621 --> 01:27:32,680
Showing me fake dreams..

1131
01:27:32,757 --> 01:27:37,160
..he bluffs. My foolish,
deceiving beloved.

1132
01:27:37,228 --> 01:27:39,025
Give me all the love now.

1133
01:27:39,097 --> 01:27:43,625
How do l express my feelings?

1134
01:27:43,701 --> 01:27:47,831
l know all the
ruses of my beloved.

1135
01:27:47,905 --> 01:27:52,239
How do l express my feelings?

1136
01:27:52,643 --> 01:27:56,636
l know all the
ruses of my beloved.

1137
01:27:56,714 --> 01:27:59,046
Stealing my solace..

1138
01:27:59,117 --> 01:28:04,054
..he harasses me. My foolish,
deceiving beloved.

1139
01:28:14,065 --> 01:28:16,659
Stealing my solace..

1140
01:28:16,734 --> 01:28:21,671
..he harasses me. My foolish,
deceiving beloved.

1141
01:28:23,674 --> 01:28:27,405
Breaths are wavering.
My desires are crazy.

1142
01:28:27,678 --> 01:28:31,739
l feel like touching
your wet lips all the time.

1143
01:28:32,083 --> 01:28:34,210
What problem is this?

1144
01:28:34,285 --> 01:28:36,082
How do l say?

1145
01:28:36,687 --> 01:28:40,680
l might go crazy in this trance.

1146
01:28:40,758 --> 01:28:44,421
l am in a trance. l
am not in my senses.

1147
01:28:45,096 --> 01:28:46,757
Love is the game l want to play.

1148
01:28:46,831 --> 01:28:49,766
l am craving for your body now.

1149
01:28:49,834 --> 01:28:51,768
Showing me fake dreams he bluffs.

1150
01:28:51,836 --> 01:28:56,705
My foolish, deceiving beloved.

1151
01:28:56,774 --> 01:28:58,298
Give me all the love now.

1152
01:28:58,442 --> 01:29:00,706
Showing me fake dreams he bluffs.

1153
01:29:00,778 --> 01:29:05,238
My foolish, deceiving beloved.

1154
01:29:05,316 --> 01:29:07,307
Give me all the love now.

1155
01:29:11,722 --> 01:29:16,785
l was so happy. l felt like
the luckiest girl in the world.

1156
01:29:18,729 --> 01:29:20,924
Ranvir wanted to give me a surprise.

1157
01:29:21,732 --> 01:29:24,132
He took me to a
marriage registrar's office.

1158
01:29:25,069 --> 01:29:26,468
We got married there.

1159
01:29:27,738 --> 01:29:31,333
l didn't know that my
happiness would last just for a day.

1160
01:29:34,145 --> 01:29:37,808
Can l see your marriage certificate?

1161
01:29:45,756 --> 01:29:47,155
Can l keep this for verification?

1162
01:29:48,092 --> 01:29:49,150
Yes.

1163
01:29:49,227 --> 01:29:54,824
Thank you. Thank you
for your cooperation.

1164
01:30:11,244 --> 01:30:12,302
Sophia!

1165
01:30:16,048 --> 01:30:17,310
How dare you come here!

1166
01:30:18,251 --> 01:30:19,980
You killed my Ranvir!

1167
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:22,319
And now you have come
here to show sympathy!

1168
01:30:22,388 --> 01:30:25,323
Sophia! Ranvir was my brother!

1169
01:30:25,391 --> 01:30:29,452
Because of you, he died! l
don't want to see your face!

1170
01:30:30,062 --> 01:30:32,656
Just get out of here! Get out!

1171
01:30:34,267 --> 01:30:35,325
Get out!

1172
01:30:45,945 --> 01:30:47,139
Did you observe something?

1173
01:30:47,947 --> 01:30:50,939
Yes, sir! Today you're
eating half a kg of strawberry!

1174
01:30:53,286 --> 01:30:56,016
What an observation!
- Thank you, sir!

1175
01:30:59,358 --> 01:31:00,484
Hello, Mr. Rajiv!

1176
01:31:01,427 --> 01:31:02,485
You have come here too?

1177
01:31:07,099 --> 01:31:08,157
lt's my habit.

1178
01:31:09,302 --> 01:31:12,567
Dogs and policemen are
always after someone!

1179
01:31:13,306 --> 01:31:15,501
l am not in the mood to
hear your stupid jokes.

1180
01:31:17,243 --> 01:31:19,177
Seeing his mood l remembered a song.

1181
01:31:19,979 --> 01:31:21,037
The bee ripened the fruit..

1182
01:31:21,113 --> 01:31:24,173
..and the Princess
took away the fruit.

1183
01:31:25,117 --> 01:31:28,052
But l don't understand. Which
fruit are you talking about?

1184
01:31:28,521 --> 01:31:29,579
l will explain.

1185
01:31:30,389 --> 01:31:34,587
This policy of 100
million dollars is a big fruit.

1186
01:31:36,128 --> 01:31:38,995
lf, to have this fruit,
Rajiv has killed Ronny..

1187
01:31:39,065 --> 01:31:43,399
..Ranvir's wife Sophia
will get this fruit.

1188
01:31:45,004 --> 01:31:49,998
And even if it's really an
accident and Rajiv is innocent..

1189
01:31:50,076 --> 01:31:52,010
..only Sophia will get this fruit.

1190
01:31:52,078 --> 01:31:53,602
Why are you saying
this again and again?

1191
01:31:54,547 --> 01:31:56,071
We are not interested in the money!

1192
01:31:57,550 --> 01:31:58,608
Sonia!

1193
01:32:03,556 --> 01:32:06,218
Yes! The grapes are sour!

1194
01:32:08,628 --> 01:32:11,028
Sir, you are eating
strawberry and not grapes!

1195
01:32:12,565 --> 01:32:15,033
Thank you. Let's go now.
- Okay.

1196
01:32:17,436 --> 01:32:20,769
Sonia! l have made a fool
proof plan for 100 million.

1197
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:24,100
lf you help me, l will
give you 20 million.

1198
01:32:24,443 --> 01:32:26,104
l didn't get even 20 rupees.

1199
01:32:27,046 --> 01:32:28,104
Being Ranvir's widow
is more beneficial..

1200
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:29,772
..than being your wife!

1201
01:32:31,117 --> 01:32:32,778
Without doing anything,
Sophia became a millionaire.

1202
01:32:33,052 --> 01:32:34,576
Now divorce me and liberate me!

1203
01:32:35,054 --> 01:32:36,112
Shut up!

1204
01:32:37,056 --> 01:32:39,115
The insurance money is
mine and l alone will get it.

1205
01:32:39,191 --> 01:32:40,249
lmpossible!

1206
01:32:40,326 --> 01:32:42,191
This won't happen as
long as Sophia is alive!

1207
01:32:45,464 --> 01:32:46,658
Everything is possible!

1208
01:32:56,409 --> 01:32:57,467
Franko!

1209
01:33:08,287 --> 01:33:09,345
Hello, Mr. Rajiv.

1210
01:33:10,423 --> 01:33:12,482
This place is not
good for welcoming you.

1211
01:33:13,492 --> 01:33:16,484
What has brought you here?
Ranvir is no more.

1212
01:33:17,363 --> 01:33:19,160
l want a girl dead.

1213
01:33:21,167 --> 01:33:22,498
Her photo and address are in this.

1214
01:33:23,502 --> 01:33:25,094
This time, there
should be no mistake.

1215
01:33:25,171 --> 01:33:26,229
Don't worry.

1216
01:33:26,439 --> 01:33:29,567
Not everybody is lucky
like Ranvir to escape from me.

1217
01:33:30,109 --> 01:33:31,508
l will tell you when to do it.

1218
01:33:35,448 --> 01:33:36,506
Sweetheart, money.

1219
01:33:41,454 --> 01:33:42,512
Who is she?

1220
01:33:43,522 --> 01:33:45,387
You don't worry about that.
She is my wife.

1221
01:33:46,392 --> 01:33:48,383
Don't worry. The work will be done.

1222
01:36:03,262 --> 01:36:04,456
You scared me!

1223
01:36:17,276 --> 01:36:18,402
l thought we will have some thrill..

1224
01:36:18,477 --> 01:36:23,471
..before receiving
100 million dollars.

1225
01:36:24,617 --> 01:36:25,811
How is my baby girl?

1226
01:36:27,887 --> 01:36:31,482
Come to daddy.

1227
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:03,920
Do you know what is
common between you and me?

1228
01:37:04,657 --> 01:37:05,919
That we both are nude.

1229
01:37:09,328 --> 01:37:13,731
There is one more thing.
We both love height.

1230
01:37:15,334 --> 01:37:18,531
A height from where
everything looks small.

1231
01:37:19,672 --> 01:37:24,075
This place too is at such a height.
l love this place.

1232
01:37:24,944 --> 01:37:26,411
Now this bungalow is yours.

1233
01:37:27,947 --> 01:37:30,677
Ages ago this bungalow used to
belong to my daddy's friend.

1234
01:37:31,684 --> 01:37:33,083
Ranvir and l used to
come here to play.

1235
01:37:33,752 --> 01:37:36,550
As kids, we used to have a
cycle race on this road.

1236
01:37:37,756 --> 01:37:40,691
The race between Ranvir
and me began from here.

1237
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:44,422
Come on Ronny, catch me.

1238
01:37:44,830 --> 01:37:47,697
Come on, ride is fast. Faster.

1239
01:37:48,367 --> 01:37:49,698
Faster, Rajiv.

1240
01:37:49,768 --> 01:37:50,826
Brother, slow.

1241
01:37:50,970 --> 01:37:53,029
No, Rajiv, try to catch me.

1242
01:37:57,710 --> 01:37:58,972
Ranvir always used to win.

1243
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:03,109
Daddy used to give a
party to celebrate.

1244
01:38:04,383 --> 01:38:07,443
l used to feel really bad.
But l never cried.

1245
01:38:07,786 --> 01:38:11,654
l would think how to defeat Ranvir.

1246
01:38:13,726 --> 01:38:16,456
But Ranvir won daddy's
trust faster than me.

1247
01:38:18,797 --> 01:38:21,391
After daddy's death,
l found that he had..

1248
01:38:21,467 --> 01:38:24,402
..transferred his business,
property..

1249
01:38:24,470 --> 01:38:26,938
..everything in Ranvir's name.

1250
01:38:29,008 --> 01:38:31,806
ln my own house, l
became a second class citizen.

1251
01:38:35,414 --> 01:38:36,540
Whenever l wanted something..

1252
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:39,615
..l had to implore Ranvir for it.

1253
01:38:41,620 --> 01:38:43,611
He would lovingly
give me everything.

1254
01:38:45,424 --> 01:38:47,415
But he also made me
realize that l am lowly..

1255
01:38:47,493 --> 01:38:48,687
..and he is great.

1256
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:53,158
His love became my hatred for him.

1257
01:38:55,768 --> 01:38:57,167
ln the end hatred won.

1258
01:38:59,438 --> 01:39:01,838
ln the race of life l
defeated him permanently.

1259
01:39:04,443 --> 01:39:05,501
Forget the past.

1260
01:39:06,178 --> 01:39:08,646
Now everything will
be fine in our lives.

1261
01:39:09,982 --> 01:39:12,849
The inspector will file his report.

1262
01:39:13,452 --> 01:39:15,852
And we will receive
our insurance money.

1263
01:39:16,855 --> 01:39:19,449
There is only one problem. Sonia.

1264
01:39:20,459 --> 01:39:22,450
When she finds that we're together..

1265
01:39:22,528 --> 01:39:23,859
..she will try to create problems.

1266
01:39:25,664 --> 01:39:27,461
What problems will she create?

1267
01:39:27,866 --> 01:39:30,198
l made her give her
own death contract.

1268
01:39:31,804 --> 01:39:33,066
'l will tell you when to do it.'

1269
01:39:35,941 --> 01:39:36,999
'Sweetheart, money.'

1270
01:39:45,484 --> 01:39:49,011
Oh, so sad! But when
will he kill Sonia?

1271
01:39:49,488 --> 01:39:51,547
After receiving the
insurance's sanction letter.

1272
01:39:53,492 --> 01:39:55,687
Now there is only one man
between us and the money.

1273
01:39:57,496 --> 01:39:58,554
Officer RD.

1274
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:10,570
Cut it carefully.
Fruits are very delicate.

1275
01:40:13,912 --> 01:40:18,042
Sir! Sir, the lab report
of the marriage certificate.

1276
01:40:18,117 --> 01:40:19,914
And this is 100 per
cent authentic, sir.

1277
01:40:20,586 --> 01:40:22,520
Ranvir and Sophia's signatures..

1278
01:40:22,588 --> 01:40:24,112
..are 100 per cent authentic.

1279
01:40:25,524 --> 01:40:27,048
Thank you. You may leave.

1280
01:40:27,659 --> 01:40:29,251
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1281
01:40:29,862 --> 01:40:34,526
Mini.. assume that we
are getting married.

1282
01:40:35,067 --> 01:40:36,728
No, sir! l don't accept it.

1283
01:40:37,803 --> 01:40:41,068
ldiot, l am not proposing to you!
- So?

1284
01:40:41,140 --> 01:40:42,198
l am telling you to imagine!

1285
01:40:42,741 --> 01:40:45,073
lmagine that we are getting married.

1286
01:40:45,544 --> 01:40:48,945
Why should l imagine you?
Why not Brad Pitt?

1287
01:40:49,882 --> 01:40:51,941
Do you think you are Angelina Jolie?

1288
01:40:52,885 --> 01:40:54,079
l am talking about the case.

1289
01:40:54,887 --> 01:40:56,548
Assume that we are getting married.

1290
01:40:56,622 --> 01:40:58,886
ln the marriage registrar's office.

1291
01:41:00,559 --> 01:41:02,618
And this is the
marriage certificate.

1292
01:41:09,568 --> 01:41:14,631
Now you sign. Why
did you take my pen?

1293
01:41:16,575 --> 01:41:18,975
l'd have had to open my
purse and search for a pen.

1294
01:41:19,044 --> 01:41:21,638
And your pen was
right here. So l took it.

1295
01:41:21,713 --> 01:41:24,773
Right! This is what
people normally do.

1296
01:41:26,985 --> 01:41:30,580
But in this marriage certificate,
one signature..

1297
01:41:30,656 --> 01:41:35,059
..is done with an ink pen
and the other with a ball pen.

1298
01:41:35,928 --> 01:41:36,986
What do you mean?

1299
01:41:38,063 --> 01:41:40,122
l mean you book two
tickets for Cape Town.

1300
01:41:40,599 --> 01:41:41,657
Why, sir?

1301
01:41:41,733 --> 01:41:42,791
Because that place is
famous for coconuts.

1302
01:41:43,602 --> 01:41:47,663
The coconut will break. And
the truth will be revealed.

1303
01:41:48,140 --> 01:41:49,198
Oh!

1304
01:41:58,083 --> 01:41:59,141
Are you sure?

1305
01:41:59,218 --> 01:42:02,619
Yes. Mr. Ranvir and his
secretary Sophia had come there.

1306
01:42:02,955 --> 01:42:04,946
He had finalized a
deal with his client.

1307
01:42:06,892 --> 01:42:08,018
Were they both
here till the evening?

1308
01:42:08,093 --> 01:42:09,151
Not both, sir.

1309
01:42:09,228 --> 01:42:10,820
Only Mr. Ranvir was
here till the evening.

1310
01:42:11,029 --> 01:42:13,623
ln the afternoon, his
secretary suddenly fell ill.

1311
01:42:13,699 --> 01:42:15,166
And she returned to the hotel.

1312
01:42:21,974 --> 01:42:23,168
Thank you for your cooperation.

1313
01:42:24,176 --> 01:42:25,700
How far is the
marriage bureau from here?

1314
01:42:25,978 --> 01:42:27,036
lt's nearby, sir.

1315
01:42:27,112 --> 01:42:28,704
But today is Sunday. So it's closed.

1316
01:42:29,848 --> 01:42:30,906
Yes.

1317
01:42:31,183 --> 01:42:32,241
Now?

1318
01:42:33,051 --> 01:42:34,109
Now what? lt will open tomorrow.

1319
01:42:34,186 --> 01:42:35,380
We will go there tomorrow.
What else?

1320
01:42:36,054 --> 01:42:37,851
Sir, what will we do today?

1321
01:42:39,658 --> 01:42:43,389
Today? Today we will
take a tour of Cape Town.

1322
01:43:09,087 --> 01:43:11,214
Sir, what happened? Why are
you looking at me like this?

1323
01:43:11,890 --> 01:43:14,757
Mini, how do you find me?

1324
01:43:15,827 --> 01:43:16,885
A genius, sir.

1325
01:43:18,096 --> 01:43:20,894
l know that.

1326
01:43:20,966 --> 01:43:24,697
So many times l have told you
not to repeat things l know.

1327
01:43:24,770 --> 01:43:29,707
l feel embarrassed.
Say something else.

1328
01:43:30,776 --> 01:43:32,903
Sir, shall l ask you something?

1329
01:43:34,713 --> 01:43:35,771
Yes. Go ahead.

1330
01:43:35,847 --> 01:43:41,308
ln the marriage certificate you
saw the difference between inks.

1331
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:44,120
But l didn't. Sir, why is my
mind not sharp like yours?

1332
01:43:44,189 --> 01:43:46,919
Because there is a big
problem with you, Mini.

1333
01:43:46,992 --> 01:43:48,926
Sir, you say this every time.

1334
01:43:48,994 --> 01:43:51,121
Today you have to tell
me what my problem is.

1335
01:43:51,196 --> 01:43:52,788
Do you have a boyfriend?

1336
01:43:53,065 --> 01:43:54,396
Sir, how can l have a boyfriend?

1337
01:43:54,733 --> 01:43:56,792
l am with you the whole day.

1338
01:43:57,069 --> 01:43:58,798
That's your problem!

1339
01:43:59,338 --> 01:44:01,465
You have crossed the
silver jubilee of life!

1340
01:44:02,074 --> 01:44:03,735
And you neither have a boyfriend..

1341
01:44:03,809 --> 01:44:04,867
..nor are you married.

1342
01:44:05,744 --> 01:44:07,803
Sir, even you are not married.

1343
01:44:09,147 --> 01:44:12,344
Yes. But l have danced a lot
in other people's marriages.

1344
01:44:13,352 --> 01:44:19,757
Look, Mini. Our body
needs not just food..

1345
01:44:20,092 --> 01:44:21,150
..but many other things.

1346
01:44:22,094 --> 01:44:24,494
Without that there is
frustration in the body.

1347
01:44:25,030 --> 01:44:26,827
You can't concentrate on your work.

1348
01:44:28,033 --> 01:44:29,091
l don't understand.

1349
01:44:29,167 --> 01:44:32,102
There are some things
which can't be explained.

1350
01:44:32,771 --> 01:44:33,965
You have to do it practically.

1351
01:44:34,906 --> 01:44:36,840
Let's go inside. l
will explain to you. Come.

1352
01:44:37,909 --> 01:44:39,900
Assume that your
boyfriend is with you.

1353
01:44:40,779 --> 01:44:43,179
He comes near you.
He holds your hand.

1354
01:44:44,116 --> 01:44:45,515
He pulls you towards him.

1355
01:44:45,851 --> 01:44:49,844
Sir, from left or right?
- Just come.

1356
01:44:51,990 --> 01:44:53,048
How do you feel?

1357
01:44:54,793 --> 01:44:55,851
lt feels nice.

1358
01:44:56,128 --> 01:44:57,993
Then he kisses your cheeks.

1359
01:44:58,397 --> 01:45:00,797
Sir, left side or right side?

1360
01:45:00,866 --> 01:45:01,992
Any side!

1361
01:45:06,271 --> 01:45:09,798
Now how does it feel?
- Sir, very nice.

1362
01:45:10,142 --> 01:45:12,804
Then he kisses your lips.

1363
01:45:13,211 --> 01:45:18,148
Sir! Here there is no left side.
So we should stop.

1364
01:45:18,216 --> 01:45:20,548
Why? You don't like me?

1365
01:45:21,019 --> 01:45:24,011
Sir, it's not that. l
consider you as my God.

1366
01:45:24,356 --> 01:45:26,017
Now that's a new one!

1367
01:45:26,158 --> 01:45:31,425
And we worship God. And not
love him. Right, sir? Bye.

1368
01:45:33,832 --> 01:45:34,890
ldiot!

1369
01:45:35,367 --> 01:45:39,827
Now how to explain to her that
this God wants to hug his devotee.

1370
01:45:47,179 --> 01:45:48,237
Mr. Max.

1371
01:45:48,313 --> 01:45:49,905
Please have a seat.
He'll be here in 5 minutes.

1372
01:45:49,981 --> 01:45:51,039
Okay.

1373
01:45:51,116 --> 01:45:53,380
Am l your father's servant?
You've begotten children!

1374
01:45:53,452 --> 01:45:56,853
Did you do me a favor?
Wasn't l involved in that?

1375
01:45:56,922 --> 01:46:00,050
l am in the office. l
have some respect here.

1376
01:46:00,392 --> 01:46:01,859
What do you think of me?
Having children!

1377
01:46:01,927 --> 01:46:02,985
Could you beget kids without me?

1378
01:46:03,061 --> 01:46:04,858
Talking nonsense! You
will tell my father!

1379
01:46:04,930 --> 01:46:06,591
You're a wife,
behave like one! Shut up!

1380
01:46:08,867 --> 01:46:09,925
Tell me.

1381
01:46:10,001 --> 01:46:11,059
Look we..
- Want to get married.

1382
01:46:11,136 --> 01:46:12,194
Nowadays guys are
marrying each other..

1383
01:46:12,270 --> 01:46:13,464
..and so are girls.

1384
01:46:13,538 --> 01:46:14,869
What has happened to you both?

1385
01:46:14,940 --> 01:46:15,998
What has affected both of you?

1386
01:46:16,074 --> 01:46:18,872
l say instead of getting
married and bringing a wife..

1387
01:46:18,944 --> 01:46:20,002
..don't feel bad,
buy a mobile phone!

1388
01:46:20,078 --> 01:46:21,272
Buy a mobile phone!

1389
01:46:21,346 --> 01:46:24,406
lf you talk from one mobile, the
other mobile doesn't get angry.

1390
01:46:24,483 --> 01:46:25,950
Got it? Don't mind it, sister.

1391
01:46:26,017 --> 01:46:27,211
You can keep it on silent mode.

1392
01:46:27,285 --> 01:46:28,479
But what will you do with your wife?

1393
01:46:28,887 --> 01:46:30,286
You can change its ring tone.

1394
01:46:30,355 --> 01:46:33,882
l say, sister, don't feel bad.
A wife has only one tone.

1395
01:46:33,959 --> 01:46:36,291
Sorry, sister. A wife
doesn't come into your grasp.

1396
01:46:36,361 --> 01:46:38,488
You can hold this. Even
keep it in your pocket.

1397
01:46:38,630 --> 01:46:40,427
You can even exchange it.

1398
01:46:40,899 --> 01:46:42,491
You can sell the old
piece and buy a new one.

1399
01:46:42,567 --> 01:46:44,899
But a wife is an old piece.
How long will you use her?

1400
01:46:44,970 --> 01:46:48,497
Don't mind, sister. A
wife is like a chewing gum.

1401
01:46:48,907 --> 01:46:49,965
Thank you.

1402
01:46:50,041 --> 01:46:52,976
lnitially you find it sweet.
Then you just chew it.

1403
01:46:53,044 --> 01:46:54,909
lf you too want to
chew all your life..

1404
01:46:54,980 --> 01:46:56,914
..then fill the form,
l will sign on it.

1405
01:46:58,250 --> 01:46:59,979
l am R.D..

1406
01:47:00,318 --> 01:47:04,982
R.D. Burman! Music director!
l am your big fan!

1407
01:47:05,323 --> 01:47:07,450
l am alive because
l hear your music.

1408
01:47:07,526 --> 01:47:10,461
Otherwise l would have died, Mr. RD.

1409
01:47:10,929 --> 01:47:14,330
l am not that RD. RD
means Robert D'Costa.

1410
01:47:14,933 --> 01:47:16,662
lnspector Robert D'Costa!

1411
01:47:16,935 --> 01:47:20,336
lnspector? My wife has sent you!

1412
01:47:20,405 --> 01:47:22,669
Look, it's only a small quarrel.

1413
01:47:22,941 --> 01:47:24,340
lt's not a fight. l
am not a criminal.

1414
01:47:24,409 --> 01:47:25,467
l am a nice husband.

1415
01:47:25,544 --> 01:47:27,068
At times, there is
a misunderstanding.

1416
01:47:27,145 --> 01:47:28,203
Wife and husband..

1417
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:29,611
l have come here regarding a case.

1418
01:47:30,015 --> 01:47:31,141
Another case.

1419
01:47:31,483 --> 01:47:33,007
And l want to ask
you a few questions.

1420
01:47:33,084 --> 01:47:34,142
Okay.

1421
01:47:34,553 --> 01:47:35,611
Show him the snap.

1422
01:47:41,293 --> 01:47:42,555
Sandal on the head..

1423
01:47:42,961 --> 01:47:44,155
l am holding it upside down.

1424
01:47:46,298 --> 01:47:47,356
Do you know her?

1425
01:47:47,432 --> 01:47:51,027
Yes! She had come to me a
few days ago to get married.

1426
01:47:55,173 --> 01:47:56,367
With this guy?

1427
01:47:56,441 --> 01:47:58,568
No, no! He looks like a decent guy!

1428
01:47:58,977 --> 01:48:00,968
But the guy she married..

1429
01:48:01,046 --> 01:48:03,037
..was hot tempered.

1430
01:48:03,114 --> 01:48:04,706
He beat my photographer.

1431
01:48:04,983 --> 01:48:07,508
He snatched the camera
and broke it. Very bad!

1432
01:48:07,986 --> 01:48:09,385
What did he look like?

1433
01:48:09,988 --> 01:48:14,391
He had two legs, two ears,
two eyes and one nose.

1434
01:48:14,993 --> 01:48:17,393
He looked like a man.
l am not lying.

1435
01:48:17,462 --> 01:48:19,054
You have to come to Durban with us.

1436
01:48:20,131 --> 01:48:21,996
There, our
department's artist will..

1437
01:48:22,067 --> 01:48:23,728
..draw a sketch based
on your description.

1438
01:48:25,003 --> 01:48:26,994
l don't have a
problem in coming, sir.

1439
01:48:27,072 --> 01:48:29,540
But if you want a sketch
then l have his photo.

1440
01:48:29,741 --> 01:48:31,333
Draw the sketch from the photo.

1441
01:48:31,409 --> 01:48:32,535
You have his photo?

1442
01:48:32,611 --> 01:48:33,669
Yes! Yes!

1443
01:48:33,745 --> 01:48:37,476
We click shady people's
snaps with our secret camera.

1444
01:48:37,549 --> 01:48:39,210
We clicked his photo. Here.

1445
01:48:44,022 --> 01:48:45,751
Sir, he is Rajiv!

1446
01:48:47,425 --> 01:48:50,417
But why did he marry Sophia?

1447
01:48:52,564 --> 01:48:59,436
Rajiv is really smart. He
has plotted a nice plan.

1448
01:48:59,504 --> 01:49:04,032
This is nothing. My
wife does better things.

1449
01:49:04,109 --> 01:49:07,044
Look at me. l was 6 feet tall.
Now l am 5 feet tall.

1450
01:49:09,047 --> 01:49:13,040
Thank you.
- Welcome, sir. Pardon me, sister.

1451
01:49:36,074 --> 01:49:37,132
Good morning!

1452
01:49:44,416 --> 01:49:46,145
lf you people want,
you all can join us.

1453
01:49:46,618 --> 01:49:47,676
lnspector..

1454
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:49,478
Please come!

1455
01:49:49,554 --> 01:49:52,079
What a nice surprise! Ma'am!

1456
01:49:53,425 --> 01:49:55,086
You see, after Ranvir's death..

1457
01:49:55,160 --> 01:49:56,218
..Sophia was feeling very lonely.

1458
01:49:56,294 --> 01:49:58,091
So you know, l thought..

1459
01:49:58,163 --> 01:50:01,223
..we'll stroll on
the beach hand in hand.

1460
01:50:02,100 --> 01:50:03,624
So cute!
- Yes! Really cute!

1461
01:50:03,702 --> 01:50:04,760
Such a nice brother-in-law!

1462
01:50:05,103 --> 01:50:07,162
He doesn't let his sister-in-law
feel his brother's absence.

1463
01:50:07,238 --> 01:50:09,706
But l feel you should
have waited for sometime.

1464
01:50:10,442 --> 01:50:12,637
l know this place is
away from the city.

1465
01:50:12,711 --> 01:50:14,508
But you shouldn't have
taken such a big risk.

1466
01:50:15,113 --> 01:50:17,308
At least till the time you
received the policy money.

1467
01:50:17,716 --> 01:50:19,183
Some fruits?

1468
01:50:20,118 --> 01:50:21,176
What are you trying to say?

1469
01:50:21,252 --> 01:50:22,310
Saw that, Mini?

1470
01:50:22,387 --> 01:50:24,514
This is the specialty of
intelligent criminals.

1471
01:50:25,123 --> 01:50:26,522
They never give up.

1472
01:50:28,126 --> 01:50:31,459
Yesterday, l went to Cape Town.

1473
01:50:33,131 --> 01:50:36,191
l met an estate agent there.

1474
01:50:37,335 --> 01:50:39,530
The one whom brother Ranvir
and sister-in-law had met.

1475
01:50:40,538 --> 01:50:43,871
There, suddenly
sister-in-law fell ill.

1476
01:50:44,542 --> 01:50:48,672
Neither she was free for two
days nor Ranvir proposed her.

1477
01:50:49,347 --> 01:50:55,684
Ranvir told sister-in-law
to go and rest in the hotel.

1478
01:50:56,488 --> 01:50:58,217
But she was in a
hurry to get married.

1479
01:50:59,424 --> 01:51:01,688
She reached the marriage registrar.

1480
01:51:05,163 --> 01:51:11,159
Mr. Rajiv was already there.
And they got married.

1481
01:51:12,504 --> 01:51:14,699
But Ranvir's signature is
on the marriage certificate!

1482
01:51:14,773 --> 01:51:16,240
How did this happen?

1483
01:51:16,508 --> 01:51:17,566
Because of her!

1484
01:51:17,642 --> 01:51:19,166
She had already taken
Ranvir's signature..

1485
01:51:19,244 --> 01:51:20,302
..on the marriage certificate.

1486
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:31,250
'So many times l've told you
not to call me in the office.'

1487
01:51:31,322 --> 01:51:32,584
'Hang on! Here. Sign.'

1488
01:51:33,191 --> 01:51:37,719
Then our naive sister-in-law
changed the original certificate..

1489
01:51:37,796 --> 01:51:39,593
..to the one signed by Ranvir.

1490
01:51:40,732 --> 01:51:43,257
Then in the registrar's office
she gave her real signature.

1491
01:51:48,206 --> 01:51:50,731
And Mr. Purshottam
pretended to sign.

1492
01:51:54,746 --> 01:51:56,270
Now who is Purshottam?

1493
01:51:57,215 --> 01:51:58,614
Mr. Rajiv is Purshottam.

1494
01:52:00,218 --> 01:52:02,743
Didn't you book the air
ticket to Cape Town in this name?

1495
01:52:05,824 --> 01:52:07,758
That day 91 people
went to Cape Town.

1496
01:52:08,693 --> 01:52:10,627
l spoke to 90 people.

1497
01:52:11,563 --> 01:52:14,623
But l didn't get any
clues about Purshottam.

1498
01:52:16,634 --> 01:52:22,300
But l did get the photo
from the marriage bureau.

1499
01:52:31,583 --> 01:52:32,641
How much will you take?

1500
01:52:38,256 --> 01:52:39,848
What made you think that
l will accept a bribe?

1501
01:52:42,260 --> 01:52:45,661
Don't insult my intelligence..
officer.

1502
01:52:48,666 --> 01:52:50,258
lf you hadn't wanted money..

1503
01:52:50,335 --> 01:52:51,393
..by now l'd have
been in the lockup.

1504
01:52:53,671 --> 01:52:55,662
He is right! You are right!

1505
01:52:56,808 --> 01:52:58,275
l will take 25 per
cent of the total amount.

1506
01:52:58,343 --> 01:52:59,674
8 per cent service tax waived.

1507
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:03,804
Till then l will eat fruits.

1508
01:53:06,618 --> 01:53:09,815
Done. ln return you
will give us a clean chit.

1509
01:53:11,289 --> 01:53:13,348
So that we get the
policy money quickly.

1510
01:53:14,692 --> 01:53:16,956
l have given the clean chit.

1511
01:53:17,695 --> 01:53:21,290
And your.. sanction
letter too is ready.

1512
01:53:24,836 --> 01:53:29,830
l will wait for your call. Bye.
Bye, sister-in-law.

1513
01:53:31,376 --> 01:53:32,434
Ma'am!

1514
01:53:40,852 --> 01:53:43,047
Sir, l couldn't have even imagined.

1515
01:53:43,321 --> 01:53:45,721
You're usually after 5-10 lakhs.

1516
01:53:46,324 --> 01:53:49,384
This time it's 25 per
cent of 100 million dollars!

1517
01:53:49,460 --> 01:53:51,394
lt means 25 million dollars.

1518
01:53:52,330 --> 01:53:53,388
You don't worry.

1519
01:53:53,865 --> 01:53:55,924
Like always you will get your money.

1520
01:53:56,334 --> 01:53:59,326
Along with that, 1 lakh as tip.
- Thank you, sir.

1521
01:54:00,738 --> 01:54:01,796
Mention not.

1522
01:55:03,868 --> 01:55:07,463
Sanction letter? Sophia Singh.
How did it come to Rajiv.

1523
01:56:04,462 --> 01:56:06,521
Did you see her?
- You bet!

1524
01:57:23,741 --> 01:57:24,799
Hello.

1525
01:57:24,876 --> 01:57:26,138
Where should l deliver your money?

1526
01:57:27,879 --> 01:57:29,608
There is a children's
society at King Cross road.

1527
01:57:30,615 --> 01:57:32,082
Go there and donate
my share of money.

1528
01:57:34,552 --> 01:57:35,610
Donate?

1529
01:57:35,686 --> 01:57:38,951
lt's my money. lt's my money.
l can do anything with it.

1530
01:57:40,024 --> 01:57:41,082
Good luck.

1531
01:59:00,037 --> 01:59:01,095
Franco?

1532
01:59:38,009 --> 01:59:41,342
Wake up and feel the pace.

1533
01:59:41,412 --> 01:59:45,075
Don't stand up as this is race.
Wake up and feel the pace.

1534
02:00:02,700 --> 02:00:04,099
Run, Sonia!

1535
02:01:11,369 --> 02:01:12,893
Now stay like this for sometime.

1536
02:01:15,172 --> 02:01:17,402
Today for the first time,
l see fear on your face.

1537
02:01:18,376 --> 02:01:19,775
You are looking very pretty.

1538
02:01:21,779 --> 02:01:25,442
Ronny.. l never
faced death so closely.

1539
02:01:26,784 --> 02:01:29,844
When l am with you,
why are you scared?

1540
02:01:31,856 --> 02:01:34,916
When you told me about the
sanction letter in Sophia's name..

1541
02:01:35,793 --> 02:01:36,919
..l understood!

1542
02:01:37,461 --> 02:01:40,191
That Rajiv will try to kill
you after receiving the money.

1543
02:01:40,531 --> 02:01:42,795
But Rajiv has already
withdrawn the money from the bank.

1544
02:01:42,867 --> 02:01:44,926
l know. This is what l wanted.

1545
02:01:45,870 --> 02:01:48,964
After all it's the
money of my death.

1546
02:01:49,807 --> 02:01:51,536
So how can Rajiv take it?

1547
02:01:53,144 --> 02:01:58,548
Everything is under control.
The plan is working.

1548
02:02:05,289 --> 02:02:08,554
Oh yeah! l want to
get going like this.

1549
02:02:11,429 --> 02:02:15,024
Show me what you've got.
C'mon, show me what it's like.

1550
02:02:15,833 --> 02:02:18,358
Show me what you've got.

1551
02:02:18,436 --> 02:02:25,365
C'mon, show me what it's like.
Show me, l'm loving it.

1552
02:02:34,185 --> 02:02:36,176
The race of breath.

1553
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:38,254
The race of love.

1554
02:02:38,322 --> 02:02:40,187
The race of heartbeats.

1555
02:02:40,391 --> 02:02:42,985
My heart is racing on.

1556
02:02:43,060 --> 02:02:44,584
The race of breath.

1557
02:02:44,862 --> 02:02:46,591
The race of love.

1558
02:02:46,997 --> 02:02:49,056
The race of heartbeats.

1559
02:02:49,133 --> 02:02:50,930
My heart is racing on.

1560
02:02:51,001 --> 02:02:59,875
Your intoxication
takes me on a high.

1561
02:02:59,944 --> 02:03:01,935
O Allah!

1562
02:03:02,012 --> 02:03:04,071
There is restlessness everywhere.

1563
02:03:04,148 --> 02:03:06,275
Separation is difficult.

1564
02:03:06,417 --> 02:03:08,351
ln your love.

1565
02:03:08,419 --> 02:03:10,410
O Allah!

1566
02:03:10,488 --> 02:03:12,547
There is restlessness everywhere.

1567
02:03:12,623 --> 02:03:15,023
Separation is difficult.

1568
02:03:15,092 --> 02:03:17,026
ln your love.

1569
02:03:17,094 --> 02:03:18,527
l feel.

1570
02:03:43,187 --> 02:03:47,123
We endured the craving
of desires for so long.

1571
02:03:47,258 --> 02:03:51,251
We didn't tell
anybody about our plight.

1572
02:03:51,529 --> 02:03:55,989
Now l want to live in
the shade of your tresses.

1573
02:03:56,066 --> 02:03:59,467
l can even lay
down my life for you.

1574
02:03:59,537 --> 02:04:08,411
Your charms have robbed me.

1575
02:04:08,479 --> 02:04:10,413
O Allah!

1576
02:04:10,481 --> 02:04:12,676
There is restlessness everywhere.

1577
02:04:12,750 --> 02:04:14,684
Separation is difficult.

1578
02:04:14,952 --> 02:04:17,011
ln your love.

1579
02:04:17,087 --> 02:04:19,078
O Allah!

1580
02:04:19,156 --> 02:04:21,215
There is restlessness everywhere.

1581
02:04:21,292 --> 02:04:23,419
Separation is difficult.

1582
02:04:23,494 --> 02:04:26,691
ln your love.

1583
02:04:27,631 --> 02:04:30,031
O Allah!

1584
02:04:31,969 --> 02:04:34,164
There is restlessness everywhere.

1585
02:04:45,049 --> 02:04:49,383
Now it's not possible to separate.

1586
02:04:49,453 --> 02:04:53,651
My life is nothing without you.

1587
02:04:53,991 --> 02:04:58,052
l dream about you. l desire you.

1588
02:04:58,128 --> 02:05:01,723
l desire the
feeling of your presence.

1589
02:05:01,799 --> 02:05:10,537
My heart is crazy for you.

1590
02:05:10,608 --> 02:05:12,667
O Allah!

1591
02:05:12,743 --> 02:05:15,143
There is restlessness everywhere.

1592
02:05:15,212 --> 02:05:17,146
Separation is difficult.

1593
02:05:17,214 --> 02:05:19,205
ln your love.

1594
02:05:19,283 --> 02:05:21,274
O Allah!

1595
02:05:21,352 --> 02:05:23,343
There is restlessness everywhere.

1596
02:05:23,420 --> 02:05:25,684
Separation is difficult.

1597
02:05:25,756 --> 02:05:28,554
ln your love.

1598
02:05:56,186 --> 02:05:58,245
Hello, sir.
- Good afternoon.

1599
02:05:58,322 --> 02:05:59,721
l'd like to make a
donation to the orphanage.

1600
02:06:02,593 --> 02:06:05,187
Sir, you've given
donation so much for these kids.

1601
02:06:05,262 --> 02:06:06,320
Thank you.

1602
02:06:13,804 --> 02:06:15,795
l've given the money to
the orphanage manager.

1603
02:06:16,340 --> 02:06:17,398
Thanks, buddy.

1604
02:06:18,409 --> 02:06:20,809
Now enjoy the rest of
your life. Okay? Bye.

1605
02:06:33,090 --> 02:06:34,557
Sir, it's for you.

1606
02:06:35,159 --> 02:06:36,217
Thank you.

1607
02:06:43,767 --> 02:06:44,825
Thank you.

1608
02:06:45,836 --> 02:06:47,098
You are most welcome.

1609
02:06:50,441 --> 02:06:52,102
Sir, why did you take the money..

1610
02:06:52,176 --> 02:06:53,507
..through the orphanage?

1611
02:06:53,844 --> 02:06:56,108
lf we had taken it directly,
we wouldn't have had..

1612
02:06:56,180 --> 02:06:57,442
..to give money to the manager.

1613
02:06:57,514 --> 02:06:59,106
lf you accept bribe in
the name of a good cause..

1614
02:06:59,183 --> 02:07:01,447
..then there is no fear of
being slandered or being caught.

1615
02:07:01,852 --> 02:07:03,251
l was afraid.

1616
02:07:03,320 --> 02:07:05,117
l thought you've really reformed..

1617
02:07:05,189 --> 02:07:06,247
..and are being so charitable.

1618
02:07:07,658 --> 02:07:09,387
Charity begins at home, Sayang.

1619
02:07:09,660 --> 02:07:11,719
As you sow so shall you reap!

1620
02:07:12,262 --> 02:07:14,127
So do your deed
according to the fruits..

1621
02:07:14,198 --> 02:07:15,460
..you want to reap.

1622
02:07:16,133 --> 02:07:23,198
Now l won't eat fruits. l
will eat only dry fruits.

1623
02:07:26,210 --> 02:07:30,340
Oh Rajiv, today we will celebrate.
Celebration on our victory.

1624
02:07:30,414 --> 02:07:32,348
Okay? - You are the boss,
baby. - Thank you.

1625
02:07:35,152 --> 02:07:38,280
Ages ago this bungalow used to
belong to my daddy's friend.

1626
02:07:39,223 --> 02:07:41,282
Ranvir and l used to
come here to play.

1627
02:07:41,892 --> 02:07:44,759
As kids we used to have
cycle race on this road.

1628
02:07:46,563 --> 02:07:49,555
The race between Ranvir
and me began from here.

1629
02:07:50,901 --> 02:07:52,425
Ranvir always used to win.

1630
02:07:53,170 --> 02:07:55,297
Daddy used to give a
party to celebrate.

1631
02:07:55,706 --> 02:07:58,903
l used to feel really bad.
But l never cried.

1632
02:07:59,309 --> 02:08:02,506
l would think how to defeat Ranvir.

1633
02:08:03,714 --> 02:08:06,649
But Ranvir won daddy's
trust faster than me.

1634
02:08:08,452 --> 02:08:11,785
After daddy's death l found that..

1635
02:08:19,196 --> 02:08:22,723
..he had transferred the business,
property, in Ranvir's name.

1636
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:29,205
And in my own house l
became a second class citizen.

1637
02:08:29,273 --> 02:08:31,207
Whenever l wanted something..

1638
02:08:31,275 --> 02:08:33,869
..l had to implore to Ranvir.

1639
02:08:34,678 --> 02:08:37,272
He would lovingly
give me everything.

1640
02:08:37,948 --> 02:08:40,212
But he also made me
realize that l am lowly..

1641
02:08:40,284 --> 02:08:41,683
..and he is great.

1642
02:08:42,486 --> 02:08:45,353
His love became my hatred for him.

1643
02:08:45,956 --> 02:08:47,617
ln the end hatred won.

1644
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:52,358
ln the race of life l
defeated him permanently.

1645
02:08:59,636 --> 02:09:03,436
What's the matter, Rajiv?
The race is still not over..

1646
02:09:03,974 --> 02:09:05,965
..and you've declared the result.

1647
02:09:30,534 --> 02:09:33,401
You're thinking that l had
fallen from the terrace.

1648
02:09:35,005 --> 02:09:37,405
There's a difference
between falling and dying.

1649
02:09:38,342 --> 02:09:41,004
You saw only what l showed you.

1650
02:09:43,947 --> 02:09:47,405
Not yours but my plan was working.

1651
02:09:48,752 --> 02:09:50,811
You were watching my every movement.

1652
02:09:51,688 --> 02:09:53,815
And l was keeping a
tab on your every move.

1653
02:09:57,628 --> 02:09:58,993
l'd have never found out..

1654
02:09:59,696 --> 02:10:01,926
..if you had not received
that call in the hospital.

1655
02:10:05,302 --> 02:10:08,294
'Hello.
- Hello Mr. Rajiv.

1656
02:10:08,705 --> 02:10:09,763
l am Franco speaking.

1657
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:10,898
'Why did you call me?'

1658
02:10:11,308 --> 02:10:12,366
For the money.

1659
02:10:12,576 --> 02:10:14,840
'Money? For what?'

1660
02:10:15,379 --> 02:10:19,782
'Ronnie is alive. He didn't die.
Nothing has happened to him.'

1661
02:10:21,318 --> 02:10:25,982
'l told you he shouldn't
survive at any cost. No.'

1662
02:10:26,390 --> 02:10:29,655
'You won't do anything. Now l
will do what is to be done.'

1663
02:10:32,062 --> 02:10:34,326
After returning home
from the hospital..

1664
02:10:34,398 --> 02:10:35,524
..l searched your bedroom.

1665
02:10:39,069 --> 02:10:40,764
There l found Sonia's file.

1666
02:10:44,675 --> 02:10:47,337
l wondered how did
you got Sonia's file..

1667
02:10:47,411 --> 02:10:48,878
..when you have not even met her.

1668
02:10:50,080 --> 02:10:51,342
l understood.

1669
02:10:52,482 --> 02:10:55,474
That you'll use
Sonia to kill me again.

1670
02:10:56,353 --> 02:11:01,620
But before you could befriend
Sonia, l gave her hand in yours.

1671
02:11:03,427 --> 02:11:05,361
That was not sacrificing my love.

1672
02:11:06,029 --> 02:11:08,497
l wanted to know your plan.

1673
02:11:25,849 --> 02:11:27,077
Sorry, Rajiv.

1674
02:11:27,451 --> 02:11:30,386
The man you gave the
contract to kill me..

1675
02:11:30,454 --> 02:11:31,853
..has himself died.

1676
02:11:34,458 --> 02:11:36,119
Consider it as a gift from me.

1677
02:11:37,127 --> 02:11:40,392
You are still alive
because before killing you..

1678
02:11:40,464 --> 02:11:44,525
..l want to know why
you wanted to kill me.

1679
02:11:45,936 --> 02:11:49,394
When l found that your
plan is of 100 million..

1680
02:11:49,473 --> 02:11:51,134
..l made a plan of 200 million.

1681
02:11:52,142 --> 02:11:54,076
For the people, l died first.

1682
02:11:54,678 --> 02:11:56,543
So that you could get 100 million.

1683
02:11:57,881 --> 02:12:02,545
And then after killing you, l will
get yours and my death's 200 million.

1684
02:12:03,487 --> 02:12:07,082
But you turned out to be smarter.

1685
02:12:07,891 --> 02:12:09,415
You didn't let me get a clue..

1686
02:12:09,493 --> 02:12:10,755
..that you and Sophia are together.

1687
02:12:11,428 --> 02:12:14,955
And after my death you even
proved that Sophia is my wife.

1688
02:12:15,432 --> 02:12:17,024
So that the police
don't suspect you.

1689
02:12:17,701 --> 02:12:20,499
And the insurance money is
transferred in Sophia's name.

1690
02:12:23,573 --> 02:12:27,976
And you.. Mrs. Ranvir Singh.

1691
02:12:29,780 --> 02:12:32,044
Touch me, touch me.
Kiss me, kiss me.

1692
02:12:33,183 --> 02:12:34,775
You are a fine actress.

1693
02:12:36,186 --> 02:12:37,778
You should have been in Hollywood.

1694
02:12:41,058 --> 02:12:44,459
l had to wait till the money was
transferred in Sophia's account.

1695
02:12:45,529 --> 02:12:48,464
And during this
period l found out that..

1696
02:12:48,532 --> 02:12:50,523
..you didn't do all
this just for the money.

1697
02:12:52,202 --> 02:12:55,000
There was rancor in your
heart and mind for me.

1698
02:12:56,006 --> 02:12:57,871
Since childhood you
wanted to defeat me.

1699
02:13:02,012 --> 02:13:03,741
You should have told
me once, lovingly.

1700
02:13:04,748 --> 02:13:06,079
l would've deliberately lost.

1701
02:13:06,149 --> 02:13:07,207
Enough!

1702
02:13:08,752 --> 02:13:11,744
This is what l hate! This love!

1703
02:13:12,556 --> 02:13:15,491
This fake love
reminds me every time..

1704
02:13:15,559 --> 02:13:17,117
..that l am your step-brother!

1705
02:13:17,894 --> 02:13:19,623
l was deliberately losing.

1706
02:13:20,230 --> 02:13:22,698
l wanted to defeat
you on my own merit!

1707
02:13:24,634 --> 02:13:26,499
You could never win
because you were..

1708
02:13:26,570 --> 02:13:28,231
..always thinking of defeating me.

1709
02:13:30,173 --> 02:13:33,700
And l never lost because l
always thought of winning.

1710
02:13:34,578 --> 02:13:37,513
Today too, in the
attempt to defeat me..

1711
02:13:37,581 --> 02:13:38,639
..you yourself have lost.

1712
02:13:38,982 --> 02:13:43,180
Yes, l lost. But what did you think?

1713
02:13:45,122 --> 02:13:48,523
That you will lecture me
and l'll fall at your feet..

1714
02:13:48,592 --> 02:13:50,253
..and beg for my life?

1715
02:13:52,195 --> 02:13:56,996
You want to kill me?
Come on! Kill me!

1716
02:13:57,734 --> 02:13:58,792
Kill me!

1717
02:13:59,536 --> 02:14:00,594
Come on!

1718
02:14:04,608 --> 02:14:06,803
l want to remove your rancor.

1719
02:14:09,146 --> 02:14:12,274
All your life you wanted to
defeat me on your own merit.

1720
02:14:13,550 --> 02:14:19,750
So fine! Today let's have
another race. A last race.

1721
02:14:20,157 --> 02:14:22,682
As kids we would have a cycle race.

1722
02:14:23,160 --> 02:14:24,821
Today let's have the race of life.

1723
02:14:25,562 --> 02:14:28,622
And the one who wins..
will get everything.

1724
02:14:28,698 --> 02:14:30,029
What are you saying, Ranvir?

1725
02:14:30,567 --> 02:14:31,898
You are giving him another chance?

1726
02:14:31,968 --> 02:14:33,026
Sonia, please.

1727
02:14:33,570 --> 02:14:34,832
lt's between us.

1728
02:14:38,041 --> 02:14:41,977
What do you say, Rajiv? 200 million.

1729
02:14:43,180 --> 02:14:46,047
Or.. or nothing.

1730
02:14:46,583 --> 02:14:48,312
The race of breath.

1731
02:14:48,785 --> 02:14:50,912
The race of love.

1732
02:14:51,054 --> 02:14:53,648
The race of heartbeats.

1733
02:14:53,790 --> 02:14:57,317
My heart is racing on.

1734
02:15:00,931 --> 02:15:01,989
Let's do it.

1735
02:15:10,006 --> 02:15:12,133
Wow, what a sports car.

1736
02:15:19,616 --> 02:15:20,674
Are you ready?

1737
02:15:21,618 --> 02:15:23,677
Anybody can win in this car.

1738
02:15:33,363 --> 02:15:37,299
Not the car but the
driver wins the race.

1739
02:16:57,113 --> 02:16:59,377
No breaks!

1740
02:17:00,116 --> 02:17:01,174
What?

1741
02:17:10,727 --> 02:17:15,323
Elder brother! Are the
brakes functioning fine?

1742
02:17:18,068 --> 02:17:19,467
See you in hell.

1743
02:17:21,137 --> 02:17:24,197
l too will come there.
But after 50-60 years.

1744
02:17:34,751 --> 02:17:35,877
lt is Ronny.

1745
02:17:38,822 --> 02:17:41,484
Ronny, my friend! Any last wish?

1746
02:17:41,558 --> 02:17:42,957
You are wrong, Rajiv.

1747
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:45,894
We won't meet after 50-60 years.

1748
02:17:46,162 --> 02:17:47,891
But we will meet after 5-6 minutes.

1749
02:17:47,964 --> 02:17:49,488
ls that so? How?

1750
02:17:50,033 --> 02:17:51,227
There is a bomb in your car.

1751
02:17:52,836 --> 02:17:54,235
Remember jockey Monto?

1752
02:18:00,910 --> 02:18:02,104
Now don't apply the brake.

1753
02:18:02,779 --> 02:18:06,180
lf the car's speed is less than
100 then your car will explode.

1754
02:18:06,850 --> 02:18:08,909
Now neither l nor you can stop.

1755
02:18:09,452 --> 02:18:12,910
My brake is not working. And
you can't apply the brakes.

1756
02:18:19,462 --> 02:18:21,259
Race.

1757
02:18:33,076 --> 02:18:35,874
Race.

1758
02:18:58,101 --> 02:18:59,159
Ranvir!

1759
02:18:59,836 --> 02:19:00,894
Hang on!

1760
02:19:02,038 --> 02:19:03,972
Race.

1761
02:21:32,722 --> 02:21:34,713
l raced with honesty.

1762
02:21:36,192 --> 02:21:38,456
But today Rajiv betrayed me again.

1763
02:21:41,130 --> 02:21:43,189
l didn't plant any bomb in the car.

1764
02:21:53,676 --> 02:21:58,079
Wow! Not just the younger brother..

1765
02:21:58,147 --> 02:22:01,139
..but even the elder
brother is very smart.

1766
02:22:02,018 --> 02:22:04,145
Sir, this story has ended.

1767
02:22:05,088 --> 02:22:09,149
No, Mini. This story
is still not over.

1768
02:22:09,425 --> 02:22:11,154
The end is still left.

1769
02:23:18,094 --> 02:23:19,755
Come, big brother.

1770
02:23:21,564 --> 02:23:24,158
Mini, there are 200
million dollars in his car.

1771
02:23:24,767 --> 02:23:29,636
His 100 million and 100
million of his poor late brother.

1772
02:23:30,506 --> 02:23:34,374
Why don't l kill him
and seize all the money?

1773
02:23:37,113 --> 02:23:39,843
As it is he is dead
for the world. Right?

1774
02:23:49,325 --> 02:23:53,853
Drop the gun. l am only
afraid of honest people.

1775
02:24:08,211 --> 02:24:11,612
'l won't die. He will die.'

1776
02:24:12,482 --> 02:24:13,881
'Yes, Ranvir here.'

1777
02:24:14,550 --> 02:24:15,608
'Yes, dude. Tell me.'

1778
02:24:16,219 --> 02:24:17,413
'l want to meet you.'

1779
02:24:18,287 --> 02:24:20,551
'Fine, we will meet in
the evening in the club.'

1780
02:24:23,226 --> 02:24:26,161
'And you will have to
arrange for a dead body..

1781
02:24:26,229 --> 02:24:28,823
..which you could
easily prove as my corpse.'

1782
02:24:28,898 --> 02:24:30,297
'Don't worry, partner.'

1783
02:24:31,367 --> 02:24:34,894
'Money can make
everything possible.'

1784
02:24:52,388 --> 02:24:56,848
'l still love you, Ronny. But 20
million dollar is a big amount.'

1785
02:24:57,527 --> 02:24:58,585
l am sorry.

1786
02:25:02,198 --> 02:25:03,859
'l guess this is where
we say goodbye, Ronny.'

1787
02:25:30,827 --> 02:25:33,227
We've pulled the biggest
scam of the century, dude.

1788
02:25:36,499 --> 02:25:40,367
Sonia.. give him his share.

1789
02:25:42,305 --> 02:25:44,296
Take your money. Keep it in the car.

1790
02:26:17,540 --> 02:26:21,476
lt was fun working with you. Bye.

1791
02:26:22,345 --> 02:26:23,403
Bye.

1792
02:26:28,417 --> 02:26:32,012
Sir, l have never
seen such a big amount.

1793
02:26:32,421 --> 02:26:34,753
lt's our hard earned money.
Open the bag and check.

1794
02:26:39,295 --> 02:26:41,422
Sir, bomb!

1795
02:26:58,447 --> 02:27:05,376
lf you had tried to kill me,
you too wouldn't have survived.

1796
02:27:11,060 --> 02:27:12,527
l hope we never meet again.

1797
02:27:13,996 --> 02:27:15,054
Smart boy.

1798
02:27:29,412 --> 02:27:32,404

1810
02:28:17,460 --> 02:28:19,587
My heart is racing on.

My heart is racing on.

1815
02:28:27,803 --> 02:28:36,609
Your intoxication
takes me on a high.

1816
02:28:36,679 --> 02:28:38,738
O Allah!

1817
02:28:38,814 --> 02:28:40,805
There is restlessness everywhere.

1818
02:28:40,883 --> 02:28:43,147
Separation is difficult.

1819
02:28:43,419 --> 02:28:45,546
ln your love.

1820
02:28:45,621 --> 02:28:47,555

So hot!

1825
02:29:04,774 --> 02:29:08,972
Oh, when you're touching my body.
Oh, you're simply driving me crazy.

1826
02:29:09,045 --> 02:29:11,445
You know what,
there's no need to worry..

1827
02:29:11,514 --> 02:29:13,448
..l'll smack it up and take it down,
till we get dirty.

1828
02:29:13,516 --> 02:29:17,577
You know what, l kind of like it,
in the bedroom or anywhere like it.

1829

l feel that when you're kissing my
neck, l feel l just can't take it.

1830
02:29:21,991 --> 02:29:23,925
This smoldering of desires.

ln the shade of your tresses.

02:29:37,139 --> 02:29:38,731
l will give my heart away.
