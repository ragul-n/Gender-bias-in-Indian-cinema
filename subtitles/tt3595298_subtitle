1
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:58,657
"I have got the treasure of love."

2
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:05,930
"I have got the treasure of love."

3
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:13,069
"My guru gave me
this invaluable gift."

4
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:17,205
"I accepted it gratefully."

5
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:24,016
"I have got the treasure of love."

6
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:31,528
"I have got the treasure of love."

7
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,375
Here you go son of Dashrath...

8
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,378
...take your bow.

9
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:55,115
Chaubey sir,
a humble request...

10
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,277
...kindly give me a new bow.

11
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,550
This breaks
when I pull it...

12
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,523
...then I've to stop the play
and glue it.

13
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,161
Who told you to pull it like
Lord Rama?

14
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,092
Adjust!

15
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:06,994
Help boss!

16
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,962
These shoes
are tight!

17
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:10,398
The nails hurt!

18
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:14,027
Instead of laughing in the
scene they make me cry!

19
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:17,939
<i>The aunt who flayed
Raven behave you...</i>

20
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,075
...had a smaller shoe size.
So what can I do?

21
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,874
Inflation is on a rise.

22
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,449
If I had bought new shoes for you
I couldn't have afforded food...

23
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,815
and we would've had
to eat your shoes for dinner.

24
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,717
You also adjust!

25
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,115
Once Prem Dilwala...

26
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,489
...finds out about
all this...

27
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,461
...he will "adjust" boss!

28
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,160
We'll begin our play...

29
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,497
...with the scene where...

30
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,999
...Sita is picking
flowers in the garden!

31
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:19,630
Let's have some rocking songs!

32
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,311
Brother.

33
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,149
Glory to Lord Rama!

34
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,653
Glory to Lord Hanuman!

35
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,190
Glory to all the saints!

36
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,487
Glory to all the devotees!

37
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,859
Glory to Lord Rama!

38
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,755
Some use their hands well...

39
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,101
...while some use their feet.

40
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,533
But I use both well!

41
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,405
Where are you going?

42
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:00,606
Who narrates Rama's story here?

43
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,144
You, Mr. Prem.

44
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,037
Me...

45
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:09,716
...and what do I do before
I start narrating?

46
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,580
You make a grand entry.

47
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:20,253
And right before my entry you
were misbehaving, that too with Sita!

48
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,897
Sorry my mistake.

49
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,456
Pardon me Lord...

50
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:29,963
...but if anyone tries to
disrupt your beautiful tale...

51
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:34,812
...it makes your devotee very angry!

52
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,547
Glory to Lord Hanuman!

53
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:05,373
"Let there be an uproar
that shocks the neighbor."

54
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:08,844
"Let us glorify compassion."

55
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,922
"A story of Rama and Sita
and propriety and modesty."

56
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:22,288
"Teaching the way of love."

57
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:25,994
"The girl and the guy
will both learn."

58
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:32,665
"The girl and the guy
will both learn.."

59
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,262
"..Ram and Sita's unique.."

60
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:43,105
"..love story."

61
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,642
We next move on to King Janak's court...

62
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,081
...where Lord Rama
is sitting with a smile.

63
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:55,320
Ravan is proudly...
staring at the bow!

64
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:59,295
And then he arrogantly steps forward!

65
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:18,239
"Silly is the Ruler of Lanka
to stare at women."

66
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:22,878
"Silly is the Ruler of Lanka
to stare at women."

67
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,253
"Get your dirty mind off Janaki."

68
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:29,349
"Get your dirty mind off Janaki."

69
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,828
"Be ashamed of your deeds."

70
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:36,458
"Ravan, you better
leave this place."

71
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:40,265
"Why are you angry?"

72
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:46,436
"Why are you angry?"

73
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:49,969
"Ram and Sita's unique.."

74
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:56,453
"..love story."

75
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:08,999
"Meeting between Sita and Rama
was similar to Radha and Shyam."

76
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,694
"Meeting between Sita and Rama
was similar to Radha and Shyam."

77
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,070
"Love is easy to get."

78
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,167
"Love is easy to get."

79
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,578
"Listen Chotu, Bhappu,
Raju, Gopal, and Gappu..."

80
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,207
"...you too will meet
the princess of your dreams."

81
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,652
"It could be
Meena, Rajjo, or Sheela."

82
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,223
"It could be
Meena, Rajjo, or Sheela."

83
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,829
"Don't you see it?"

84
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:47,532
"It's a love story."

85
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:04,846
Prem Bhaiya (Brother),
I still can't understand why you...

86
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,718
Our town's unrecognized actor...

87
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,656
why are you still
talking like a woman?

88
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,693
You're not playing Sita anymore.

89
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,328
You make me so angry!

90
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,093
What is it about Uphaar Foundation...

91
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,964
that once again you're
donating all your earnings to it?

92
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,366
Uphaar Foundation is run by...

93
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:24,903
...Princess Maithili of Devgarh.

94
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,255
Ma'am, I know that the
Princess is in Delhi these days.

95
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,390
She has a big fashion boutique there.

96
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,361
Very good!

97
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:00,097
But when is she coming back?

98
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,866
She was here last year...

99
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:05,499
on Sunday,
20th September at 3:30pm.

100
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,874
She came in her flying chariot.
I remember.

101
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,380
I don't know when
she's coming here next.

102
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,611
But next week, she's
coming to Pritampur!

103
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,714
Pritampur!

104
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:21,319
It's only a day's journey from here.

105
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:25,351
The Princess is engaged to
Vijay Singh, the Prince of Pritampur.

106
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,954
And next week is
the Prince's coronation...

107
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,966
...she will definitely
attend that!

108
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,796
Why don't you meet her there?

109
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,595
She won't meet me.

110
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,331
Of course she will.

111
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:39,876
And when you do meet her...

112
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,912
...give your donation
box to her personally.

113
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,743
She'll be really happy.

114
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:45,713
Okay.

115
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:49,052
Why don't you come along too?
For moral support!

116
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,054
I won't go.

117
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:52,520
I won't...

118
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,785
Who's even asking you?

119
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,225
You're my compulsory companion!

120
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,456
Let's Pritampur. . . rrrrrrr !

121
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,837
Your Highness,
the estate of Pritampur...

122
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:22,250
...that you'll be inheriting from
the Late King, it's rather expensive.

123
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,753
I've heard it's worth billions.

124
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,455
Should I put it at...

125
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,154
...let me not give it a figure.

126
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,385
It's wow!

127
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,323
How do you feel?

128
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,921
I feel blessed.

129
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,897
Your Prime Minister,
Deewan Saheb, was saying that...

130
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:39,334
...guests from all over the world
will be attending your coronation.

131
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,803
The entire estate will be decorated...

132
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:45,434
...and you'll be crowned
with pomp and show.

133
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:48,068
By the way, in today's times...

134
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:51,081
..."silly" is not the word, but...
I do find it funny.

135
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,480
What do you say?

136
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,281
You think traditions are funny?

137
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,552
No, I...

138
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,749
Is this clown here to waste my time?

139
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:02,958
Sir.

140
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,523
Excuse me!

141
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,660
Following our traditions...

142
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,497
...is more important to
me than being the King.

143
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:12,399
Next.

144
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:15,368
So on that day we'll
see you in royal attire...

145
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:21,237
...armed with the royal sword, riding
an elephant amongst an army of horses?

146
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,644
Yes.

147
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,079
That day no one in
Pritampur will need to cook.

148
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,042
Every resident...

149
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,552
...Every resident will be a royal guest.

150
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:32,281
We'll decorate this
palace like a bride.

151
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:33,789
There'll be fireworks.

152
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,456
Everyone will be chanting one thing...

153
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,517
"Glory to King Vijay Singh!"

154
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:41,394
Not Vijay Singh..."Glory to Pritampur!"

155
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,429
Get my fencing gear
ready for tomorrow.

156
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,896
That was close Ajay.
Very good!

157
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:33,311
Ow, Bhaisaheb (Elder Brother)...
- Bhaisaheb wins!

158
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,950
Happy Holi!

159
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:44,858
You rascal...

160
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:47,958
Bhaisaheb...no!

161
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,338
Well done Princes!

162
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:03,942
No!

163
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:04,772
Yes.

164
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:07,443
No, no...no is good, sir. No is fine.

165
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:08,914
You guys were brilliant.

166
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:11,682
Yes!

167
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,222
Thank God sir...

168
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,094
Thank God this wasn't a
real competition between you two...

169
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:22,996
...and just a practice.

170
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,162
Thank you.

171
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,963
Sir, this friendly match...

172
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,401
...will greatly entertain...

173
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:30,565
...the guests at the coronation.

174
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:31,972
What do you say?
- Not bad.

175
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:35,069
Your Highness, Princess Maithili
has sent her confirmation.

176
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:38,011
She'll be arriving in Pritampur
on Friday by the 2 o'clock train.

177
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,914
We'll have to make
security arrangements.

178
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:44,078
Who will be going
to the station to receive her?

179
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,053
Bhaisaheb first.

180
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:50,651
Bhaisaheb, I'm going to organize
a bouquet of 1,000 red roses.

181
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,456
Please...take it with a smile.

182
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,490
Tell him.

183
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:54,963
Superb sir.

184
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,998
Thank you.

185
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,795
I think I'll avoid it.

186
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,767
Because when people see us together...

187
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,429
...they start blessing us oddly.

188
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:06,499
Your Highness, as per tradition...

189
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:10,372
...your sisters should
go to receive the Princess.

190
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:27,393
After mom passed away,
whenever I missed her as a child...

191
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,324
...father used to say...

192
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:32,926
'You're not alone Vijay,
you have two more mothers...'

193
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,062
'...Ajay's mother..'

194
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,035
'...Chandrika and Radhika's mother.'

195
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:39,837
'You're very fortunate
to have such a big family.'

196
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,434
Fortunate?

197
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,572
We're all living separately,
aloof from each other.

198
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:47,549
Because of our common activities,
I sometimes speak to Ajay.

199
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,811
But my sisters...

200
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,554
...I wonder what they have against me.

201
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,487
The King wanted you
to keep the family united.

202
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,082
I did what I could...

203
00:16:56,148 --> 00:17:00,255
...but if my sisters don't respond,
then I can't go any further!

204
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:09,264
When family members fall apart...

205
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:12,499
...it takes almost a lifetime
to bring them together.

206
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:15,644
But should we stop trying?

207
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,881
Let's try again.

208
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,886
I'll inform Chandrika and Radhika...

209
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,929
...that the Prince is
coming to meet them tomorrow.

210
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,494
We'll go in the same royal carriage...

211
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:40,435
...in which you played
together as children.

212
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,933
We'll request them...

213
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:47,374
...to receive their would-be
sister-in-law at the station.

214
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,901
Have a seat, I'll call her.

215
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,535
Chandrika!

216
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,742
Chandrika!

217
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,873
Greetings.
- Mr. Bhandari, you? Here?

218
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:00,206
Princess Chandrika called me.

219
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:06,822
As the royal family's lawyer she wants
me to understand why you're here...

220
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,617
...and then she'll meet you.

221
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,257
She'll meet you...

222
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,529
It's not what you think Mr. Bhandari.

223
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,264
A brother's here to
meet his younger sisters.

224
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,597
It's a bit personal.

225
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,898
I'll meet her myself.

226
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,242
Chandrika.

227
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,977
Whatever we discuss will
be in front of the lawyer.

228
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:32,945
Chanda!

229
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,382
Enough!

230
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:44,525
Your Highness!

231
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,724
Chandrika! Chandri...

232
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:47,790
Your Highness!

233
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:50,990
Chuttan, let's go!

234
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:10,479
I went there as per your advice
Deewan Saheb, and that was my mistake.

235
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:14,455
If this is what family's like,
then every one's better-off alone!

236
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:54,884
Chuttan!

237
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,354
We've arrived in Pritampur!

238
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,289
No we haven't reached Pritampur yet...

239
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,954
...there's a 30 minute halt
to eat food or use the washroom.

240
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,357
30 minutes?
- Go on! Get it over with.

241
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:41,157
Sit.

242
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,130
Does anyone want to use the washroom?
- No!

243
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:46,498
No, right?
Driver, let's be on our way...quickly.

244
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:47,865
What's the hurry?

245
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,438
Will you find your bride there?

246
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:53,507
Not a bride, a Goddess...
to whom he'll make an offering.

247
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,544
Taunting tone but the right answer.

248
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:59,476
Son, won't you buy fruits
and flowers to honour the Goddess?

249
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:07,619
"My heart beats fast."

250
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:12,590
"My heart is racing."

251
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:31,906
"I have to meet her today."

252
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:37,215
"I have to meet her today."

253
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:42,918
"Let me take a gift for her.
Let me thank her."

254
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:48,727
"Let me take snacks and sweets."

255
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:54,561
"I have to meet her today."

256
00:24:54,626 --> 00:25:00,076
"I have to meet her today."

257
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:32,332
So many medicines?
Is someone really unwell?

258
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:34,107
Yes.

259
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:51,591
"She's a princess, beautiful, smart
and of a respectable family."

260
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:57,259
"It's difficult to choose
a token of my love."

261
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:05,771
"She's a princess, beautiful, smart
and of a respectable family."

262
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:11,781
"It's difficult to choose
a token of my love."

263
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:19,580
"Let me buy various
kinds of snacks."

264
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:25,287
"Something spicy and
something bitter and sour."

265
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:31,326
"I have to meet her today."

266
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:36,771
"I have to meet her today."

267
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:46,681
"My heart beats fast."

268
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:51,814
"My heart is racing."

269
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:58,318
"My heart beats fast."

270
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,390
Only one watermelon for the Princess?

271
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:05,424
Is someone else also buying
the entire market like us?

272
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:10,698
Yes...the rest of the watermelons
have been bought by that gentleman...

273
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:15,909
...he's the head security officer
of the Pritampur royal family.

274
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,652
No I don't want anything.

275
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:45,570
Thank you sir.

276
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,405
Have some guava, really sweet.

277
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:53,649
Sorry sir. I didn't have
any other way to impress you.

278
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:57,384
Please, arrange a small
meeting with the Princess.

279
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,312
We've come from really far...

280
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:03,291
...facing many difficulties
to meet Princess Maithili.

281
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,992
Sir, just a brief meeting.

282
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,430
Yes, of course.
I'll arrange a meeting for you.

283
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:13,600
We Pritampur dwellers
take good care of our guests.

284
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:14,530
Come.

285
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:15,803
In the car?

286
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:18,364
I'll get our luggage...

287
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,407
Bhaiji (Sir)...
I love you, Bhaiji!

288
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:30,218
Even Kanhaiya has
never loved me so much.

289
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:33,082
So Bhaiji what can we show you?

290
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:35,784
The plays of Chota Bheem,
Bal Hanuman...

291
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:37,984
...or the Ladies' Special...
Jai Santoshi Maa!

292
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:41,320
No...do you have a CD or something?
- Yes, of course.

293
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:42,693
We do have a CD.
- We do have a CD.

294
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:46,927
We'll show him the
best one...how about this?

295
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:49,528
No...I had a viral during
the performance.

296
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:53,473
This is our interpretation
of Vrindavan's 'Raas-Leela' for you.

297
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:54,839
I'm not interested.

298
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,606
No, Bhaiyaji,
you'll have to watch it.

299
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:59,410
For the sake of your mother...
for the sake of your cow!

300
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,781
For the sake of the
milkman that milks the cow!

301
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,759
What a view!

302
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:15,091
The Maharaja must
have had great vision!

303
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,029
This is our royal fort.

304
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,702
Take a seat and I'll arrange
for your stay.

305
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,737
Yes we'll sit.

306
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:25,270
Sir will we get an attached bathroom?

307
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,675
No it's okay. There are fields
and valleys...it's natural.

308
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:30,713
All we need is cold
water for bathing...

309
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,045
...it keeps the body
contract and strong.

310
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:36,585
And hot water for drinking.
- For voice and bowel movement...

311
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:37,651
Yes.

312
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:39,449
You'll get 24 hours room service too.

313
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:42,022
Love you Bhaiji.
- Sir how about a demonstration?

314
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,150
"Radha said..."

315
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:45,820
No I don't want to see anything.
I've some work.

316
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:46,654
I'll be right back.

317
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,664
No problem, you go freshen up.

318
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,030
We'll recreate Vrindavan
for you right here.

319
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:28,062
Sir...
- Not now. Give the packet.

320
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:38,707
Doctor if you need any other
equipment or anything else...

321
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,576
...it'll be arranged immediately.

322
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:42,979
Nothing should happen to the Prince.

323
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:52,058
Only a handful of us
are left of the Late King's...

324
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,527
trustworthy people.

325
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:58,164
The future of this
family lies in your hands.

326
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,265
You arrived at the accident spot
at the right time...

327
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,668
...thus he survived.

328
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,467
Otherwise such a fatal attack!

329
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:11,170
His survival is the result
of everyone's prayers.

330
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,583
Why didn't we take him
to the hospital, with security?

331
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:19,716
When our dear ones cross
all limits of humanity...

332
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:22,091
...then no security can do anything.

333
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,686
When's the coronation?

334
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:26,294
In four days.

335
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:28,360
The King decided this date...

336
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:30,695
...according to astrology,
on his death bed.

337
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,596
It can be inauspicious to postpone it.

338
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:37,366
Doctor it's a case of cerebral
concussion with cerebral edema.

339
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,942
These wounds on his
body will heal soon.

340
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,405
But he's suffered
internal head injuries.

341
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,140
But don't worry...

342
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,577
...there are signs of recovery.

343
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:53,181
Thank you doctor.

344
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:58,320
No one should know that
the Prince has been kept here.

345
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:38,224
"Let's go give Radha a visit."

346
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:42,598
"Let's go give Radha a visit."

347
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:46,540
"Let's go color Radha."

348
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:50,443
"Delicate little Radha
is shy of Kanha."

349
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:54,583
"Lets the lover
only a glimpse of her beauty."

350
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:58,086
"A shiver runs up her spine."

351
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:01,851
"Let's go."

352
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:05,689
"Let's go give Radha a visit."

353
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,493
"Let's go."

354
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:26,615
Sir, you've always said that
God helps those in great trouble.

355
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:34,519
"Kisna has taken a liking to
your fair complexion, Radha."

356
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:39,653
"He wonders
how to color you during Holi."

357
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:41,695
"Let's go."

358
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:42,891
What are you trying to say?

359
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,558
Sir the Prince survived this time...

360
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:48,798
...but we still don't know
who's behind this fatal attack.

361
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:52,865
If he can attack once,
he can attack again.

362
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:59,846
The Prince can only remain safe here,
when there's another Prince out there!

363
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,508
Is this the time to joke?

364
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,016
Send those two clowns
back immediately!

365
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:10,114
Yes Your Majesty?

366
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:13,523
Deewan Saheb,
Maithili and I've been trying...

367
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:17,464
...to call the Prince since a while,
but his phone's switched off.

368
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,032
Maybe he's busy.

369
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:22,928
We've received
the Princess' schedule...

370
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,202
...we'll all be there to receive her.

371
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,908
Congratulations to all of you!

372
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:29,676
Thank you.

373
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,015
Guests will be arriving
from all over the world...

374
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:39,486
...along with national
and international media.

375
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:43,651
What will we tell the Princess
and these people about the Prince?

376
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,861
And how?

377
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,835
Prem Bhaiya?

378
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:07,274
Did you ever hear that
the King visited our place? - No.

379
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:10,250
Did mom ever visit
this kingdom? - No.

380
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,820
It's all mom's fault...
he could have been your brother today!

381
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:18,520
It's just a coincidence that
you two look alike. Nothing more.

382
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,932
I've heard that you're
a very good actor.

383
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,294
Are you hesitating?

384
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:26,562
Hesitating?

385
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:32,633
Bapu (Uncle)...if we decide to imitate
you, even your wife will get confused.

386
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:37,770
The point is that he wants
me to pose as the Princess' fiance...

387
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:38,870
...for four days!

388
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:42,907
And four days also include four
nights! What are you talking Bapu?

389
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:44,452
He'll wake up right?

390
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:47,046
Or then Prem Bhaiya and
she might end up getting married.

391
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:48,112
Shut up!

392
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,486
Don't you understand
the gravity of the situation?

393
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:55,154
It's a matter of the
Prince's life and death.

394
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:59,932
Bapu we refuse to
deceive our Princess.

395
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:03,163
Bapu has no maturity.
Let's go!

396
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,898
You're not deceiving her.

397
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,535
In fact you're protecting her fiance!

398
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:14,376
What if the Princess'
fiance' is attacked again?

399
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,016
What will she go through?

400
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:24,952
How much money will you charge?

401
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,090
Immature Bapu!

402
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,597
This is our Princess' future home.

403
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,793
It's a matter of our pride and honour!

404
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,463
There's no question of money!

405
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:44,111
Keep a straight face! Sit straight!

406
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,887
Bapu!

407
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:56,256
When you have
Dashrath's experience...

408
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:58,453
...why are you getting
impatient like young Laxman?

409
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,586
Let young India work too.

410
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,723
Don't you dare touch anything
of the royal household.

411
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:07,195
You've a role to play here as well...

412
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:09,938
...your role is of
a senior photographer.

413
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:12,473
Who's come here
for the coronation.

414
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,339
You've been trying to create a book...

415
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:16,708
...of all the royal family
pictures since 1970.

416
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,337
The beard is fine, so are the clothes.

417
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,775
But you haven't thought of a name yet.

418
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:21,714
You're such a useless writer.

419
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:25,151
It's the height of naivety. If Masoorie
uncle was alive, he would've slapped you.

420
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:26,586
But I'll think of something.

421
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,180
I found a name!

422
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:29,256
Naadaan Masoorie.

423
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:31,418
I told you I'll think of something.

424
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:34,257
I've got it. Naadaan Masoorie!

425
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:37,089
Why aren't you wearing your shoes?

426
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:38,895
Put them on me.

427
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:43,872
I'm not allowed to touch anything
of the royal household, right?

428
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:47,933
Bapu!
- Leave me!

429
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,879
Bapu! There should be
some give and take in life.

430
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:55,782
If you've given me the Prince's role,
give me the freedom to live like him.

431
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,514
Get that blue book
from the book shelf.

432
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,818
Oh come on Bapu is
this a job for a Prince?

433
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:03,323
Here's your book.

434
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:04,621
What the...

435
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,824
Masoorie!

436
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,996
Have a look Masoorie...

437
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:11,556
Listen carefully!

438
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:13,497
When you pull the blue book out...

439
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:16,470
...it opens this secret
door into the Prince's office.

440
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:19,298
One of us will be here 24 hours a day.

441
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,809
If there's any emergency,
come inside immediately.

442
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:22,640
Follow me!

443
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,907
I said, follow me!

444
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,677
Now you'll be shown
a DVD of the Prince.

445
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:31,743
Observe his style
and the way he speaks.

446
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:36,791
Look Masoorie,
all our dreams have come true.

447
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:40,495
Sir, let them eat something first.

448
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:44,398
They can do anything
while watching the video.

449
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:47,528
'I'm so happy you guys are here!'

450
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:50,033
'Love you guys!
Thank you!'

451
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:52,799
Due to weak digestion...

452
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:54,433
...the Prince eats only boiled food.

453
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:58,475
What's the point of being a Prince if
he eats only green stuff...health freak!

454
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,516
He's like a goat!

455
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,408
From tomorrow you'll
get only boiled food.

456
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:03,679
Bapu.
- Shut up!

457
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:04,719
Bapu.
- Shut up!

458
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:05,651
Ba...
- Shut...

459
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,620
'"-...pu...
'um

460
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:13,118
(Speaks French)

461
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,088
The Prince speaks many languages.

462
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:18,927
He speaks French,
Italian and German fluently.

463
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:23,597
A...aa...e...ee...u...uu.
- Well said!

464
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:28,274
You don't need to overact for this.
- Overact?

465
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:32,337
We'll declare that the Prince is observing
a vow of silence for the next four days.

466
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:37,479
These are the Prince's step-sisters...

467
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,350
...Princess Chandrika...

468
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,353
...Princess Radhika.

469
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:50,396
This is that driver Chuttan who took
the royal carriage to the mountains.

470
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,827
The day we lay our hands on him...

471
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:56,962
...we'll prove that this conspiracy
was planned by these people.

472
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,000
The Prince's step-brother, Ajay Singh.

473
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,805
The Prince's secretary, Sameera.

474
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,407
The Prince's distant relative...

475
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:07,847
...and the estate's CEO,
the cunning Chirag Singh.

476
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:16,354
Bhaisaheb's flag is still up.

477
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:18,824
This means he's still alive.

478
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,589
Don't worry sir.

479
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:26,224
We'll soon find out where
Deewan Saheb has hidden him.

480
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:30,597
And anyway,
after falling from such a height...

481
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:33,470
...he's probably even
having difficulty breathing.

482
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:47,785
This beautiful lady from
the 1940s is now yours.

483
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,259
And for the one who told me...

484
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:55,592
...that Bhaisaheb is going to
meet the sisters without any security.

485
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:59,225
For her...this evergreen girl.

486
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:01,335
Thank you sir!

487
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:04,373
You've a big heart, sir...very big.

488
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:08,309
You've done the big thing
by planning this accident, Chirag.

489
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,546
You've liberated me.

490
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:14,509
You're lucky you don't
have an elder brother...

491
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:16,242
...to whom you're always compared.

492
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:23,457
And papa passed away...

493
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:28,955
...but decided that his elder
son will pass all my bills.

494
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,428
Only then can I survive.

495
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:34,259
And what did the elder son do?

496
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:39,499
He rejected every bill,
like one does with contractors!

497
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,138
Today for the first time
I have given something

498
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:44,606
...without his permission.

499
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:47,313
<i>BMW'-!</i>

500
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:57,482
Sir, if the younger prince finds out...

501
00:41:57,581 --> 00:42:01,028
...that his elder brother
passed all his bills...

502
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,356
...and it was you...?

503
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:07,828
Sameera, these Kings don't have time...

504
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:11,199
...to check every cheque
book and voucher.

505
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:13,272
That's our job.

506
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:19,104
We can shake the very
foundation of these palaces.

507
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:21,680
And this is just the
beginning of my plan...

508
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:24,345
...and your gifts, Sameera.

509
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:27,389
Let's take a nice picture of you...

510
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:28,985
...come on!
- Okay.

511
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:37,788
Yes, sir.

512
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:41,592
Bhaisaheb has ordered to make arrangements
to welcome the Princess tomorrow.

513
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:44,799
He's personally going to the
station tomorrow to receive her.

514
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:47,238
How's it possible? Huh?

515
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,308
The Prince will be here soon.

516
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:55,316
I'll find out everything
and inform you Chirag sir.

517
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:57,042
Sameera.
-Yeah?

518
00:42:57,207 --> 00:43:00,154
I want to introduce you to a special guest.
- Oh! Yes, yes!

519
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:01,756
Come.
- Please.

520
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:04,388
Hello, dear.

521
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:07,390
Sameera, the Prince's orders are...

522
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:11,864
...that you'll look after Mr. Masoorie
until the coronation.

523
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:16,329
His travel arrangements, comfortable
stay...that's your responsibility.

524
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,836
But the Prince didn't
tell me anything.

525
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:21,433
He told me...to tell you.

526
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:22,735
Okay.

527
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:28,909
Sameera...a camera stand for
Mr. Masoorie, please.

528
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:30,908
Right away.

529
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,143
Of course.

530
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:38,120
Why are you involving
me with this girl?

531
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:40,355
Don't you see I've immersed
in my character?

532
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:44,388
Look, don't let Sameera
anywhere near Prem Dilwala.

533
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:46,161
What if she gets suspicious?

534
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,797
But...

535
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:53,604
Consider this a part of your role.
- This? How?

536
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:56,042
You've heard of love?
- Hmmm.

537
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,478
That's what you feel for her.

538
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:02,812
You've fit this angle of love
nicely in this story.

539
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:03,715
WOW!

540
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,552
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

541
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,250
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

542
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,554
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

543
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:13,993
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

544
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:16,291
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

545
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:18,458
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

546
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:26,067
The Princess is arriving.
Concentrate!

547
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,675
I know.

548
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,507
Do Bapu and Mrs. Bapu always fight?
He's always sullen.

549
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,843
He isn't married.

550
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,575
You mean virgin Bapu!

551
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:39,547
You're observing a vow of silence,
keep your mouth shut!

552
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:41,154
Give this to the Princess.

553
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,323
Sanjav!

554
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,354
The Princess!

555
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:15,919
"I wonder what I would say
when I meet her."

556
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:21,622
"I might say that I look up to her."

557
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:29,868
"I wonder what I would say
when I meet her."

558
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:35,701
"I might say that I look up to her."

559
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:41,878
Long live the Princess!

560
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,345
Give the flowers.

561
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:48,150
Not to me, to the Princess!

562
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,117
I hope you had a comfortable journey.

563
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:24,085
Yes...thank you.

564
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:25,816
How are you?

565
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:27,324
All okay.

566
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:29,129
How's grandma?

567
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:30,596
She's fine.

568
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,927
In fact she also wanted to come...

569
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:36,233
...but couldn't
due to her knee problem.

570
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:39,303
She sends her love.

571
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:43,274
The Prince is observing
a vow of silence for a few days.

572
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:44,875
Vow of silence?

573
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:49,847
He says that people observe
a vow of silence for inner peace.

574
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:52,547
He has his own ways!

575
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:04,832
By the way,
the Prince is allowed to hum.

576
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:09,562
We've made arrangements for
your stay at the royal guest house...

577
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:13,005
...but before that you'll have
lunch with the Prince at the palace.

578
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,507
Serve properly,
there shouldn't be any mistakes.

579
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:22,140
And the Prince shouldn't
break his vow of silence.

580
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:30,115
Thank you.

581
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:17,736
I'm sorry, but
I can't take this any longer.

582
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:23,001
I've been a self-confident
girl all my life.

583
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:26,646
But for the first time
I'm losing my bearings.

584
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:30,717
I need to know
where I'm going wrong.

585
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:37,725
Your Highness, we've been
engaged for five months...

586
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:42,526
and we've hardly communicated
more than five times!

587
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,967
I know you're not
ready for this marriage...

588
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:49,129
...and you couldn't go against
the Late King's orders.

589
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,762
You're already burdened
with a lot of responsibilities...

590
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:54,206
...and you don't want
to add another one.

591
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:57,743
Especially, when there's already
so much tension in the family.

592
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:02,279
I understand that those
who are independent-minded...

593
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:05,318
...don't like to be bossed around.

594
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:07,279
But is this fair?

595
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:13,988
If we want to spend our lives together,
we can't live like strangers.

596
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:20,594
I can't live in fear, not knowing
when you'll get angry or yell at me.

597
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:27,037
I always wanted people around us...

598
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:29,304
...so that a scene isn't created.

599
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,076
I don't even know you.

600
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:35,944
Your Highness...

601
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:41,354
...if you're not happy,
then we can go our separate ways.

602
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:43,081
I'm happy in Delhi.

603
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:46,423
Uphaar Foundation
and my business keep me busy.

604
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:49,690
I'll make grandma understand,
no problem.

605
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:54,034
I didn't even know that
you're observing a vow of silence.

606
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:00,074
I'm sorry.

607
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,270
But it's your mistake

608
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,076
...and you'll agree with me.

609
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:10,118
You never expressed
your feelings to me.

610
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,119
Because if you had,
then I would've listened...

611
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,348
...and if I'd listened,
I would've appreciated it...

612
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:16,015
...and understood.

613
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:18,250
So...how do I make up for this?

614
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:22,023
Will you finish this, or should
I order a special watermelon for you?

615
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:24,656
What about your vow
of silence for inner peace?

616
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:25,961
Vow of silence!

617
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:30,438
You see...a great scholar
Baba Prem told me...

618
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,667
...that until you don't
spread happiness in the world...

619
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:36,242
...you can't attain inner peace.

620
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:38,006
You want to know my secrets?

621
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:39,978
My highs, my lows...

622
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:42,141
mm'! UPS, my downs?

623
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,513
Give me a minute.

624
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:45,219
Deewan...

625
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:47,219
...Saheb!

626
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:50,622
What's wrong, your Highness?

627
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:54,089
You took a vow of silence!

628
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:57,097
I decided to break it.

629
00:50:57,421 --> 00:50:58,832
Does not matter.

630
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,460
We need to show the
Princess "those-those" places...

631
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,799
...where I spent my childhood.

632
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:06,802
Please make the arrangements.

633
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,546
Move it!

634
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:13,107
Move it?

635
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:19,917
The Prince studied in this
school till 8th grade.

636
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:21,978
This school was built in 1907.

637
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,424
It's architecture was believed
to be very modern in those days.

638
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:28,724
There was an All-India Kabbadi
Competition held here in 1921.

639
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:32,995
The All-Asian Hockey Tournament
was held here in 1945.

640
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:35,627
There was a Literary
Conference in 1960.

641
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:39,138
These arches are world famous!
You won't find these...

642
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:44,577
Let me tell you a world
famous story from 3rd grade.

643
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:48,946
I used to trick my teacher,
bunk school...and bathe here...

644
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:52,413
...Naked!

645
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:53,649
Huh?

646
00:51:57,581 --> 00:51:59,288
Deewan Saheb, is this true?

647
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:01,828
Deewan Saheb himself
was my swimming coach.

648
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:05,263
He taught me freestyle,
butterfly and breast stroke.

649
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,594
Say yes, or else I'll
tell her that you also...

650
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:11,662
...used to bathe here
with me...naked!

651
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,633
Those were the days.

652
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:17,076
Today's a better day.

653
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:20,581
Come Deewan Saheb let's
show the Princess our diving point.

654
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:21,512
No, no...

655
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,848
What are you looking
there for Sweetie?

656
00:52:30,947 --> 00:52:32,756
I'm the one worth looking at.

657
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:34,051
What do you want?

658
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:37,926
A blue car?

659
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:41,433
What is happening, Chirag?

660
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,336
Sameera isn't able to report
anything, and you're quiet as well.

661
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:47,768
I understand that even
after such a great fall...

662
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:49,741
...Bhaisaheb survived medically.

663
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:53,371
But, receiving the Princess
personally at the station...

664
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,983
...and now giving her
a tour of the estate...

665
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:57,207
<i>---No!</i>

666
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:00,749
This can't be Bhaisaheb!

667
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,354
Something's definitely wrong, sir.

668
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:13,995
Very wrong!

669
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:29,978
How are you doing,
Bhabhi (Sister-in-law)?

670
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,348
Welcome to your future home.

671
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:32,887
Hi Ajay, how are you?

672
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:37,186
Bapu...what's with the kisses?
- They're saying hello.

673
00:53:38,448 --> 00:53:39,927
What are you doing?
- Hello!

674
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:42,596
By the way,
I can't believe it!

675
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:46,225
He's giving you a tour of the estate...
how romantic!

676
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:51,333
He's won so many polo
tournaments in this club.

677
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:52,338
Hey, wait a minute!

678
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:55,239
Bhabhi, I'm sure you
remember the tournament...

679
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:59,144
...that Bhaisaheb played
on your engagement day?

680
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:08,983
Anyways I'll leave
the two love-birds alone...okay?

681
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,752
Okay, Bhaisaheb.

682
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:14,693
Enjoy.
- Okay. And over here...

683
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:21,828
Bapu, what was he trying to instigate?
Scoundrel!

684
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,565
You and your "those- those" places!

685
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:34,440
You had invited all your
friends to meet me that day.

686
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:36,945
We were all joking...

687
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:43,424
...and I said that you'd look
better without your moustache.

688
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:49,996
I don't know what made you so angry
that you left me alone and came here.

689
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:52,498
No, no...don't cry.

690
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:58,497
Actually...that was my
style of expressing love.

691
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:02,973
You love me?

692
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:03,943
Yes...

693
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:06,844
...very much.

694
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:10,340
But I don't know how to express it.

695
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:14,688
Let's go...
for a romantic walk?

696
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,005
Ram- Laxman!

697
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:37,634
Come here!

698
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:38,736
Quickly quickly!

699
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,280
Like the wind!

700
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,475
Terminators!

701
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:43,343
Diary! Pen!

702
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:44,677
Where are you two from?

703
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:45,615
Gujarat.

704
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:48,517
Silly boys...sit here...

705
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:50,791
...and turn around.

706
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:55,223
Before we go any further...

707
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:57,798
...list all your complaints now.

708
00:55:58,054 --> 00:56:01,194
Moustache,
shirt, tie, pant, underwear, vest...

709
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:02,429
...don't leave anything out.

710
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,129
Open your heart.

711
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:08,676
But don't make me write
that I don't love you.

712
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:19,912
"You come closer
whenever you want."

713
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:27,820
"You go away whenever you want."

714
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:31,624
Oh God!

715
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:43,235
"You come closer
whenever you want."

716
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:47,504
"You go away whenever you want."

717
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:51,381
"You always do as you please."

718
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:55,548
"Yet you say you love me."

719
00:56:55,812 --> 00:56:59,954
"I accept my mistake
and my misbehavior."

720
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:02,963
"Love makes me do crazy things."

721
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:07,161
"We break up and patch up
as per your wishes."

722
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:15,042
"We meet whenever you wish."

723
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:22,847
"You always do as you please."

724
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:26,816
"What kind of a lover are you?"

725
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:31,591
Wow! You look like a father of nine.

726
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:35,625
Now you like a father of none!

727
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:38,522
Sorry I made you wait.

728
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:44,836
Moustache?

729
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:48,237
Romance, Deewan Saheb. Romance.

730
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,608
You won't understand
the romance of young India.

731
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:53,443
The Princess didn't like my moustache,
so I shaved it off.

732
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:56,916
Princess, do you not like my nose?
Should I cut that off too?

733
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,281
What do you say Deewan Saheb?

734
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:00,821
You can cut anyone's
nose any time sir.

735
00:58:00,877 --> 00:58:02,117
Of course.

736
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:03,555
About turn.

737
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:08,586
This is the temple...

738
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:11,222
...where the Prince's first
birthday was celebrated.

739
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:13,627
The foundation of this
temple was laid in 1953...

740
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:15,498
...by the Chief Minister himself.

741
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:17,469
Many Union Cabinet ministers
graced the occasion as well.

742
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:19,538
The place was packed.

743
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:24,511
Flowers were being showered
from one entrance to the other.

744
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:27,605
Hey! Come here.

745
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:28,849
I said stop!

746
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:30,646
Bapu, stop your preaching.

747
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:32,376
As soon as you start
the geography of some place...

748
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:35,684
...it reminds her of her history,
and I've to pull out this diary.

749
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:38,985
You'll tell the Princes
only what I tell you. Understand?

750
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:39,753
Huh?

751
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:42,294
Okay Bapu.

752
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:45,661
From your own experiences with ladies...

753
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:49,397
...tell me how do I cajole this lady?

754
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,001
I...

755
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,061
Waiting Bapu.

756
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,572
Telling.

757
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:57,110
Bapu, you've zero
experience with ladies.

758
00:58:57,166 --> 00:59:00,409
Your wisdom is
incomplete...Virgin Bapu!

759
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:04,444
I'll tell the world
that you're a Virgin Bapu!

760
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:09,286
You haven't seen
this lamp decoration before...

761
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:12,493
...recently we've been
doing it every evening.

762
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:17,521
The Late King would enjoy
poetry in the light of these lamps.

763
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:22,927
He used to spend quality
time with the Queen here.

764
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:25,336
Oh...how sweet.

765
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:29,977
Bapu.
- What?

766
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:34,140
Quality time out here? Weren't
there enough rooms in the palace?

767
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,341
Keep quiet!

768
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:37,548
But Bapu...
- Now shut up!

769
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:48,293
That night I had arranged
a special barbeque for you there.

770
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:51,161
It took me three hours...

771
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:56,565
...to get ready in your
favourite short dress.

772
00:59:57,193 --> 01:00:01,107
And only because
we promised each other...

773
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:04,245
...that we wouldn't fight that evening.

774
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:08,576
We'd only talk about love.

775
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:12,345
And you...

776
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:14,551
And 1...?

777
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:18,656
'So what if I took you in my arms?
What else is love?'

778
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:21,256
Isn't this what you said?

779
01:00:23,086 --> 01:00:26,499
We couldn't discuss
our future or our feelings.

780
01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:30,797
If only you understood
what a girl really wants.

781
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:34,907
That was our last fight
and also our last meeting.

782
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,135
Prince, you didn't
leave any stone unturned?

783
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:39,578
You're messing up everything!

784
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:41,979
Quality time before marriage?

785
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:45,585
Now it's confirmed that
the Prince is a rascal!

786
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:34,558
"I still have to learn
the finer nuances of love."

787
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:38,896
"Teach me if you have the time."

788
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:46,780
"Teach me how to impress a lover
with sweet talk."

789
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:50,716
"Teach me how to
make her give up anger."

790
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:54,619
"You make mistakes
and act innocent."

791
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:58,124
"Stop these tricks."

792
01:01:58,614 --> 01:02:02,323
"Don't try to impress me.
- Don't make things worse."

793
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:05,958
"Don't even try to
patch up with me."

794
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:14,902
"You can make
the evening lovely."

795
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:23,145
"You can make
the night beautiful."

796
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:30,955
"I accept whatever punishment
you give me."

797
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:35,325
"Just give me smile."

798
01:02:42,892 --> 01:02:43,700
Spit it out!

799
01:02:43,893 --> 01:02:44,803
Spit it out!

800
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:45,839
I said spit it out!

801
01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:48,239
Camel, return my diary!

802
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:51,471
Give it back,
you won't be able to digest it!

803
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:52,740
You'll get diarrhoea.

804
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:54,543
Brother Camel! Brother Camel!

805
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:55,582
Please.

806
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:56,911
I beg of you, Brother Camel.

807
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,712
I touch your feet, Brother Camel.

808
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:02,484
Brother Camel. I will even kiss you,
Brother Camel.

809
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:08,892
I'll take this one...pack this.

810
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:15,898
Oh Bhaiji...

811
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:19,531
I have to eat boiled food because
of the Prince's weak digestion.

812
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,905
On top of that I
have to lie 25,000 times.

813
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:23,705
As soon as your Prince
wakes up from coma...

814
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,972
...I'll put a full stop to all this.

815
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:29,947
And I'll ask for a cheque
of Rs.25,000 for Uphaar Foundation.

816
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,019
Is that less?

817
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:34,921
Come in. Come in. Come in.

818
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:38,985
What are you eating?

819
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:42,723
Well, I won't lie to you.

820
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:46,962
The doctor has forced
me to eat boiled food...

821
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:51,233
...but sometimes I eat what I like.

822
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:55,506
But your weak digestion?

823
01:03:55,598 --> 01:04:00,047
Princess...it's all in the mind!

824
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:02,377
Hold this.

825
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,216
Where are you going?

826
01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:07,914
I'm thirsty, going to drink water.
- Here, I have water.

827
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:10,818
Not from a bottle like a baby.

828
01:04:11,047 --> 01:04:15,291
Like a kid,
with kids, full of life!

829
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:20,228
Kids, now I'll help
you drink water. Come on!

830
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:21,993
Here you go!

831
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:25,806
Drink up!

832
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:28,407
Enough, now my turn!

833
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:58,629
What's all this?

834
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:02,039
Chandrika!

835
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:03,768
Fix your tie.
Let's go home.

836
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:04,937
Hi, Chandrika!

837
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:11,580
I'm coming there!

838
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,953
Where've you been?

839
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,436
Radhika, you're looking so different.

840
01:05:32,795 --> 01:05:34,035
So grown up, so cute.

841
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:35,471
You'll live a long life.

842
01:05:35,564 --> 01:05:39,410
I bought this silver bracelet today,
just like those we wore in school.

843
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:41,277
Give me your hand.

844
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:00,463
Rickshaw!

845
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:05,268
Listen Chandrika...
- Let's go!

846
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:28,288
Princess Maithili
and Princess Chandrika...

847
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:31,264
...used to study together
in boarding school.

848
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,266
They were very good friends.

849
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:36,326
They were called the Royal Fairies.

850
01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:40,567
But ever since Maithili
got engaged to our Prince...

851
01:06:40,896 --> 01:06:44,969
...Chandrika broke
all ties with her.

852
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:47,510
The elder sister has
a lot of self- respect...

853
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:51,608
...she heads the accounts
department of a small school.

854
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:56,948
Both sisters live in a rented
house with basic amenities.

855
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,122
Radhika!

856
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:02,826
Radhika, open the door!

857
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:06,094
It must be the mechanic
with the serviced fridge.

858
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:11,337
Good morning, Radhika!

859
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:13,806
Your Santa Claus brother
with the big heart...

860
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:17,274
...has brought you a new TV,
new fridge, new washing machine

861
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:22,611
...and in bonus has also brought
a microwave, a kettle and a football.

862
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:30,347
Your big brother's
also brought two big beds...

863
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:33,893
...and two queen size mattresses
for my two Princess sisters.

864
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:36,486
Come on, unload everything.
And give me that.

865
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:40,967
And as bonus, I've brought
this key and that car.

866
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:45,339
Please accept all my gifts.

867
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:51,238
And Chanda,
let's just bury the past!

868
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:53,807
Of course.

869
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:57,749
But before that can
we talk in private. Please?

870
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:06,716
So what's your offer?

871
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:12,664
There's no offer,
I just brought some gifts.

872
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:13,698
And...

873
01:08:15,991 --> 01:08:18,062
...a request. Keep this.

874
01:08:18,294 --> 01:08:23,243
From one royal fairy
to the other...a gift of love.

875
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:28,680
By taking these you want us to
accept that you've won and we've lost?

876
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:32,712
There's no winning or losing
amongst siblings.

877
01:08:32,808 --> 01:08:35,948
What relationships is
he talking about Mr. Bhandari?

878
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:40,389
Which anyone can buy in the market?

879
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:45,489
Where one starts a relationship
only for his advantage!

880
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:50,894
Please ask him Uncle...

881
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:55,874
...what does the
Queen's son want...

882
01:08:56,866 --> 01:09:00,609
...from the King's mistress' daughters?

883
01:09:08,177 --> 01:09:10,817
And if you're here to show
your greatness and generosity...

884
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,487
...then pardon me,
but we don't need your favours.

885
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:16,661
Take everything back!

886
01:09:18,053 --> 01:09:20,090
Didn't you hear me?

887
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:29,809
And if it's against the future King's
honour to take these things back...

888
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:31,344
...then it's perfectly alright.

889
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:35,974
We have no such honour to
lose by throwing these things out.

890
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:47,789
Come Radhika!

891
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:38,474
Hey, put that in the centre!

892
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:41,343
And reflect this
light in that direction...

893
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:44,145
...the poor girls are melting
like ice-cream in the sun.

894
01:10:44,206 --> 01:10:45,412
One minute...

895
01:10:45,507 --> 01:10:48,420
...girls...shake your waists.

896
01:10:50,446 --> 01:10:54,690
You'll be on the front
page of my book, wonderful!

897
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:58,026
Ready?

898
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:00,626
Shake!

899
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:08,471
You're taking a still picture, right?
So why should I shake?

900
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:10,671
Don't try to teach me!

901
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:11,971
Click fast!

902
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:12,971
Yeah!

903
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:18,176
Sameera, what's happening?

904
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:21,350
Sir I'm busy with this uncle.

905
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:24,723
And where are you Chirag?

906
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,188
I'm outside the palace sir.

907
01:11:26,248 --> 01:11:28,660
Getting cars ready for the guests.

908
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:30,059
Oh, I see.

909
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:33,093
And I'm ready for my sherwani trial...

910
01:11:33,255 --> 01:11:35,667
that I'm wearing for the coronation.

911
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:40,365
The coronation is tomorrow!
What are we doing?

912
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:44,742
There are still 24 hours
left for the coronation sir.

913
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:50,049
And I'm keeping my eye on every single
thing, and on every single person!

914
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:13,803
Hello.

915
01:12:14,296 --> 01:12:16,139
Go carefully Chaudhary.

916
01:12:16,398 --> 01:12:18,469
And feed the Prince with care.

917
01:12:18,701 --> 01:12:19,771
Yes sir.

918
01:12:28,711 --> 01:12:30,418
Dilwale!

919
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:33,458
Is this the time to sleep?

920
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:37,152
I wasn't sleeping I was thinking...

921
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:40,857
...these royal men wear
such tight clothes.

922
01:12:40,956 --> 01:12:44,529
Bapu, what if someone
has to go to the washroom? - Hey!

923
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:46,502
It's confirmed, now I know!

924
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:48,097
I don't like jokes all the time.

925
01:12:48,163 --> 01:12:49,506
Lower your feet, stand up!

926
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:51,408
Yes devil...I mean Deewan!

927
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:55,571
You created such a big scene
at the sisters' house yesterday...

928
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:58,550
...thankfully everything
remained within their home.

929
01:12:58,607 --> 01:13:01,486
Today's function is at
the garden close to their house.

930
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:03,489
Nothing should go wrong, understand?

931
01:13:03,912 --> 01:13:08,418
Bapu, the sisters'
mother was not a Queen?

932
01:13:09,184 --> 01:13:12,563
None of your business!
They aren't your sisters!

933
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:18,972
Yes Sanjay.

934
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:20,832
Fine.

935
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:24,834
Princess Maithili is waiting for you...

936
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,538
...in the Prince's personal suite.

937
01:13:27,136 --> 01:13:31,209
Remember,
the Princess isn't yours either!

938
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:38,418
Bapu's lost it. Totally mad.

939
01:13:54,663 --> 01:13:57,405
I'm waiting.

940
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:07,586
Get well soon, Prince...
Bapu's making my life miserable.

941
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:14,984
Oh drat!

942
01:14:21,723 --> 01:14:25,364
Beautiful lady,
there's still some time for this!

943
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:32,536
Another secret...a secret passage!

944
01:14:32,768 --> 01:14:35,715
That goes from one heart to the other?

945
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:39,851
I've brought food
from Haldiram's shop.

946
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:43,549
Your doctors will be at the party so
they won't let you eat it...eat fast!

947
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:49,423
Did you come specially for this?

948
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:51,462
I also wanted to say sorry...

949
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:55,758
...for all the complaints
that I made you write.

950
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:59,601
I've realized what true love is.

951
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:05,936
The Prince went to his sisters'
house to make amends, for my sake.

952
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:10,149
If that isn't true love,
then what else is it?

953
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:16,751
Your coronation functions start today.

954
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:22,019
Will you find a better hostess
than me... to make them memorable?

955
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:45,515
Pardon me, Princess...

956
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:48,555
we called you and the
Prince here before the guests arrived.

957
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:51,420
Actually, we needed to discuss
today's program with the Prince.

958
01:15:51,513 --> 01:15:53,459
That's okay Deewan Saheb...
I also wanted to check...

959
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,790
...whether the flower
arrangement in the banquet area...

960
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:57,990
...is as we decided earlier.
Excuse me!

961
01:15:58,053 --> 01:15:59,794
Hold on.
- Yes, Bapu?

962
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:02,597
Take this.
- Oh a book?

963
01:16:04,026 --> 01:16:05,334
The "History of Our Kings".

964
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,806
Your speech today will
be in pure Hindi. - Huh?

965
01:16:07,863 --> 01:16:09,467
Yes, memorize it.

966
01:16:09,665 --> 01:16:12,202
Today's protocol, first your speech...

967
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:15,146
...followed by classical music...

968
01:16:15,604 --> 01:16:18,141
...after that classical dance...

969
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:20,349
...and then finally lunch!

970
01:16:20,442 --> 01:16:21,921
Oh...lunch Bapu.

971
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:23,320
Boiled for you.

972
01:16:23,478 --> 01:16:24,513
No!
<i>'</i> Yes!

973
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:31,054
Yeah.

974
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:45,367
If I were the same old Maithili...

975
01:16:45,534 --> 01:16:48,947
...then I definitely would
have misspelled your name.

976
01:16:58,814 --> 01:17:02,193
Jiji (Sister)! I'm going to school
for football practice.

977
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:05,788
No, we won't step
out of the house today.

978
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:09,295
Why should we stay at home
because of the Prince's function?

979
01:17:09,491 --> 01:17:12,233
No arguments Radhika!
I don't want anyone to think...

980
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:14,431
...that we're a part of
their happiness in any way.

981
01:17:14,496 --> 01:17:16,169
Come help me.

982
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:19,437
Radhika!

983
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:45,663
It's okay I'll redo it.
- No, no.

984
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:50,574
Today my football loving
sister will decorate this with you.

985
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:54,336
If I don't make her your
assistant in this function...

986
01:17:54,436 --> 01:17:56,507
...then my name isn't...

987
01:17:56,772 --> 01:17:58,911
...the name you're writing so lovingly.

988
01:17:58,974 --> 01:18:01,011
But for this, I need your permission.

989
01:18:01,076 --> 01:18:03,056
I want to forget
that I'm a King's son.

990
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:07,184
I want to pretend that I'm a villager,
for the betterment of the family.

991
01:18:07,315 --> 01:18:10,091
Please help!
- Permission granted.

992
01:18:11,887 --> 01:18:14,390
Then you'll also have to play along.
- Play along?

993
01:18:14,489 --> 01:18:19,199
Imagine that we're enacting
the play of Ram-Leela, and you...?

994
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:24,438
Sita will do exactly...
what Lord Rama wishes.

995
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:33,682
A warm welcome to everyone.

996
01:18:33,842 --> 01:18:35,788
And now our future King...

997
01:18:35,911 --> 01:18:40,360
...will address all
of you with a few words.

998
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:42,292
I request His Majesty...

999
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:01,877
Ladies...!

1000
01:19:04,873 --> 01:19:07,353
Ladies and Gentlemen!

1001
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:09,886
As always, it's time to...

1002
01:19:09,945 --> 01:19:15,861
...give a long speech in pure Hindi...

1003
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:19,327
...the length and breadth of which...

1004
01:19:19,387 --> 01:19:25,338
...can bore you, put you
to sleep, and make you run away.

1005
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:27,638
This ground has a history...

1006
01:19:27,796 --> 01:19:35,476
...that long ago people
played "Padh Kanduk" (Football)...

1007
01:19:35,537 --> 01:19:40,919
So for the satisfaction of our
ancestors' spirits...

1008
01:19:40,976 --> 01:19:43,980
...can we play football again,
why not?

1009
01:19:57,425 --> 01:19:58,267
Sorry sir...

1010
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:00,202
Bhaiji...

1011
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:01,102
Bhaiji...

1012
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:04,875
Sir...

1013
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:14,314
Sir! Did you get cold feet
at the thought of playing football?

1014
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:17,186
Where's your youthful energy?

1015
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:21,457
Your Highness,
you just challenged a Punjabi.

1016
01:20:21,783 --> 01:20:25,162
I haven't lost my youth or my game.

1017
01:20:25,353 --> 01:20:26,627
You let it be.

1018
01:20:26,688 --> 01:20:27,564
<i>I see...</i>

1019
01:20:27,622 --> 01:20:30,728
Then come on friends,
let's show them what we can do.

1020
01:20:32,027 --> 01:20:34,530
Let's go get them!

1021
01:20:35,096 --> 01:20:38,669
Buckle up, friends!
- Let's go!

1022
01:20:39,034 --> 01:20:42,846
Come on my heroes!

1023
01:20:48,109 --> 01:20:48,917
Sir, one minute!

1024
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:50,489
Another hero!

1025
01:20:51,146 --> 01:20:52,250
Poor hero.

1026
01:20:52,547 --> 01:20:55,551
Dear ladies...while the
gentlemen play football...

1027
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:57,722
...you can chatter and gossip.

1028
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:00,595
Excuse me!

1029
01:21:00,989 --> 01:21:02,127
Yes.

1030
01:21:02,557 --> 01:21:04,696
What do you mean
'chatter and gossip'?

1031
01:21:04,793 --> 01:21:06,067
We'll play too.

1032
01:21:07,896 --> 01:21:11,935
Look who's asking for the moon!

1033
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:16,812
Pardon me Princess, playing
football isn't your cup of tea.

1034
01:21:16,905 --> 01:21:20,114
Your place is in the
kitchen cutting vegetables...

1035
01:21:20,308 --> 01:21:22,345
...cut...cut...cut...cut...cut!

1036
01:21:25,647 --> 01:21:28,628
Hey, what nonsense! We can also play!

1037
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:31,960
Ma'am, why're you sitting
shy like a new bride?

1038
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:35,399
Do you want to spend your life in the
kitchen, or prove something to them?

1039
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:39,495
You're challenging a Punjabi woman?

1040
01:21:41,696 --> 01:21:45,701
Enough of cooking and cleaning.

1041
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:48,069
All day, just 'open the door...
close the door...

1042
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:49,911
...open the door...close the door!'

1043
01:21:49,971 --> 01:21:52,178
The time has come to show...

1044
01:21:52,307 --> 01:21:54,150
...what girls can do
on the playing field.

1045
01:21:54,209 --> 01:21:56,985
So let's rock girls
and kick some ball!

1046
01:21:57,045 --> 01:21:57,955
Yeah!

1047
01:21:58,813 --> 01:22:01,123
Let's get on the field!

1048
01:22:01,283 --> 01:22:05,925
Excuse me, excuse me!
You're all mistaken!

1049
01:22:05,987 --> 01:22:08,627
Sorry, Deewan Saheb,
we can't take you in our team...

1050
01:22:08,723 --> 01:22:11,169
...our team's full!
We give you to the girl's team!

1051
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:13,536
Take him away!
- What joke is this?

1052
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:20,270
Deewan Saheb how do we play this game?
- I don't know.

1053
01:22:20,335 --> 01:22:21,973
You just need to kick the ball.

1054
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:25,142
They don't remember birthdays,
anniversaries, or love!

1055
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:27,752
Sir, goalkeeper.
- Yes.

1056
01:22:27,809 --> 01:22:31,382
Masoorie uncle...backward.
- No, no, forward.

1057
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:32,754
<i>Forward.</i>

1058
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:36,194
Referee...full on cheating, or else...

1059
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:48,335
How was my acting?

1060
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:50,137
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

1061
01:22:50,198 --> 01:22:52,075
She's watching too.

1062
01:22:52,867 --> 01:22:56,542
Today can I also forget
that I'm a Princess?

1063
01:22:56,604 --> 01:23:00,984
And pretend that I'm a village girl...
who loves a village boy!

1064
01:23:11,753 --> 01:23:15,565
"Come here, you carefree girl."

1065
01:23:15,623 --> 01:23:20,129
"You have become quarrelsome."

1066
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:30,647
"Rude and arrogant
is your behaviour."

1067
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:36,451
"Let's fight it off."

1068
01:23:36,544 --> 01:23:40,287
"Let's fight it off."

1069
01:23:40,548 --> 01:23:44,724
"You want a fight
and you'll get it."

1070
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:47,991
"Give it your best shot."

1071
01:23:48,056 --> 01:23:53,665
"Let's fight it off."

1072
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:58,072
"Let's fight it off."

1073
01:23:58,266 --> 01:23:59,210
Ouch!

1074
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:07,653
Goal!

1075
01:24:09,177 --> 01:24:13,887
Referee foul! Foul! This is not fair!

1076
01:24:18,953 --> 01:24:22,400
Radhika go wash and
dry these clothes. - Jiji

1077
01:24:22,657 --> 01:24:23,795
Go!

1078
01:24:49,317 --> 01:24:50,352
Goal!

1079
01:24:50,552 --> 01:24:51,792
Goal!

1080
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:53,226
No!

1081
01:24:53,455 --> 01:24:55,731
Sister, one goal.

1082
01:24:55,824 --> 01:25:01,775
"Your eyes cast a spell on me."

1083
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:07,542
"Do not stare at me."

1084
01:25:07,635 --> 01:25:13,244
"Your eyes cast a spell on me."

1085
01:25:13,341 --> 01:25:18,484
"Do not stare at me."

1086
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:22,628
"Scared you are to look into my eyes.
What kind of a man are you?"

1087
01:25:22,717 --> 01:25:27,757
"How will you make me yours?"

1088
01:25:27,856 --> 01:25:33,534
"Let's fight it off."

1089
01:25:33,628 --> 01:25:37,508
"Let's fight it off."

1090
01:25:37,999 --> 01:25:38,841
Ouch!

1091
01:25:43,037 --> 01:25:44,812
Goal!

1092
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:57,255
Yeah?
- Good news sir!

1093
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:40,639
Ouch!

1094
01:27:16,631 --> 01:27:18,440
What are you doing?

1095
01:27:18,866 --> 01:27:20,709
Go away!

1096
01:27:39,754 --> 01:27:41,461
Oh come on!

1097
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:53,844
Ouch!

1098
01:27:55,903 --> 01:27:56,881
Ouch!

1099
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:43,295
Ouch!

1100
01:29:22,857 --> 01:29:24,530
Let's go!

1101
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:42,718
Start packing Radhika. We won't stay
in this estate for another minute.

1102
01:29:51,686 --> 01:29:54,030
Hurry up Radhika!

1103
01:29:56,991 --> 01:30:00,700
Do sisters leave their
families before marriage?

1104
01:30:00,795 --> 01:30:04,743
Please stop your fake
filmy dialogue and gestures!

1105
01:30:05,133 --> 01:30:07,113
Do you really care about us?

1106
01:30:07,168 --> 01:30:11,139
Do you actually know what
we're going through and what we want?

1107
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:13,109
What do you want?

1108
01:30:14,509 --> 01:30:18,514
We want the palace you live in!
Will you give it?

1109
01:30:20,581 --> 01:30:23,357
The same palace where your
mother lived with the King...

1110
01:30:23,451 --> 01:30:26,591
...but the doors were
always closed for our mother.

1111
01:30:26,654 --> 01:30:28,998
All her life our mother
shed tears in this house...

1112
01:30:29,056 --> 01:30:32,469
...while the King had one celebration
after the other over there.

1113
01:30:32,527 --> 01:30:36,498
The same palace where you'll
celebrate with your Queen.

1114
01:30:36,564 --> 01:30:38,566
We want that palace!

1115
01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:45,710
Go away! Attend to your guests!

1116
01:30:54,248 --> 01:30:56,990
The palace will be given to you.

1117
01:30:59,987 --> 01:31:04,060
This is your filmy
brother's promise to you.

1118
01:31:07,829 --> 01:31:10,867
With what right did you promise
the sisters this palace?

1119
01:31:10,965 --> 01:31:12,638
I thought it'll make them happy...

1120
01:31:13,067 --> 01:31:14,842
...but only for my knowledge Bapu...

1121
01:31:14,902 --> 01:31:17,109
...is this palace more
important than their happiness?

1122
01:31:17,171 --> 01:31:20,618
Only the Prince has the right
to ask this question, not you!

1123
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:22,278
Would he have refused?

1124
01:31:22,376 --> 01:31:25,846
In that case...the Prince
needs to learn a lot from us!

1125
01:31:25,913 --> 01:31:27,893
What did you say?

1126
01:31:27,949 --> 01:31:30,429
Look Deewan Saheb
everything's going well...

1127
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:32,260
...someday you'll give us an award.

1128
01:31:32,353 --> 01:31:33,889
You want an award?

1129
01:31:33,988 --> 01:31:36,559
Here's your award!
Bloody clowns!

1130
01:31:36,624 --> 01:31:39,230
Sanjay, get the car
now and drop them...

1131
01:31:39,293 --> 01:31:42,069
...at the same market
you picked them up from.

1132
01:31:42,129 --> 01:31:46,168
I've endured your daily antics,
but not anymore!

1133
01:31:48,069 --> 01:31:50,049
And what are you waiting for?

1134
01:31:50,137 --> 01:31:52,276
The Prince is fully
aware of our cover up...

1135
01:31:52,373 --> 01:31:55,411
...he's said he'll be present
for his coronation tomorrow.

1136
01:31:55,476 --> 01:31:58,423
Don't forget that we've also
nabbed that driver Chuttan...

1137
01:31:58,479 --> 01:32:02,484
...soon he'll confess who
conspired to kill the Prince!

1138
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:05,822
Dilwale, you're not
needed here anymore...

1139
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:06,921
...out!

1140
01:32:07,021 --> 01:32:08,193
Get out!

1141
01:32:08,489 --> 01:32:11,698
How can artists be respected
in a place where humanity isn't?

1142
01:32:11,759 --> 01:32:13,761
Let's go Prem Bhaiya!

1143
01:32:17,932 --> 01:32:18,842
Hello.

1144
01:32:20,001 --> 01:32:20,945
What?

1145
01:32:30,411 --> 01:32:32,755
When we got here...

1146
01:32:34,882 --> 01:32:37,158
...the Prince wasn't here, and...

1147
01:32:42,256 --> 01:32:45,703
Deewan Saheb,
we found this note here.

1148
01:32:47,461 --> 01:32:49,702
'We're taking him with us.'

1149
01:32:49,764 --> 01:32:55,737
'There's no need for
two Princes in one kingdom!'

1150
01:33:00,074 --> 01:33:01,075
Deewan Saheb?

1151
01:33:01,542 --> 01:33:02,646
I'm fine!

1152
01:33:03,644 --> 01:33:05,487
Careful Deewan Saheb!

1153
01:33:25,733 --> 01:33:27,269
How's Bapu?

1154
01:33:27,835 --> 01:33:29,906
He suffered another asthma attack.

1155
01:33:30,071 --> 01:33:31,914
He already has high sugar...

1156
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:36,283
...the doctor has advised
him rest.

1157
01:33:36,644 --> 01:33:39,557
We added to his tension didn't we?

1158
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:47,394
Deewan Saheb, I'll find the
Prince and bring him back...

1159
01:33:47,455 --> 01:33:49,264
...he'll be fine.

1160
01:33:49,557 --> 01:33:52,504
I know the Prince will be fine.

1161
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:54,965
Chuttan is in our custody...

1162
01:33:55,229 --> 01:33:58,608
...Ajay knows if
he hurts the Prince...

1163
01:33:58,766 --> 01:34:01,804
...then we'll make
Chuttan confess in public...

1164
01:34:01,869 --> 01:34:04,509
...his secret will be exposed.

1165
01:34:09,143 --> 01:34:14,320
Your Majesty, in order to
save one of your sons...

1166
01:34:14,615 --> 01:34:18,791
...we'll have to strike
a deal with the other.

1167
01:34:19,854 --> 01:34:25,566
Forgive me Your Majesty,
I couldn't unite your children...

1168
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:29,273
...you always wanted
them to stay together...

1169
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:33,574
...you built the Sheesh Mahal
(Palace of Mirrors) with that dream...

1170
01:34:36,103 --> 01:34:37,980
Kids have a look!

1171
01:34:46,347 --> 01:34:49,055
Gifts for all of you!

1172
01:34:49,884 --> 01:34:53,923
This is for you...for you...
and for you!

1173
01:34:55,256 --> 01:34:57,258
Deewan Saheb this
Sheesh Mahal is a symbol...

1174
01:34:57,324 --> 01:35:00,066
...of these children's innocence.

1175
01:35:00,728 --> 01:35:03,038
Their mothers are different and...

1176
01:35:03,764 --> 01:35:06,267
...that was my weakness.

1177
01:35:07,501 --> 01:35:12,541
But their hearts are one,
and that's their strength!

1178
01:35:18,345 --> 01:35:22,816
I want the children to
keep visiting this Sheesh Mahal...

1179
01:35:23,084 --> 01:35:25,690
...and every mirror here...

1180
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:29,932
...should reflect their
golden childhood to them!

1181
01:35:30,191 --> 01:35:34,606
"Where is the home of my dreams?"

1182
01:35:34,795 --> 01:35:39,301
"Mirror, take me back
to my childhood."

1183
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:43,871
"Where is the home of my dreams?"

1184
01:35:43,938 --> 01:35:48,080
"Mirror, take me back
to my childhood."

1185
01:35:48,509 --> 01:35:52,582
"Life was simple."

1186
01:35:53,013 --> 01:35:57,621
"Mirror, take me back
to my childhood."

1187
01:35:57,685 --> 01:36:02,031
"Where is the home of my dreams?"

1188
01:36:02,089 --> 01:36:06,367
"Mirror, take me back
to my childhood."

1189
01:36:43,898 --> 01:36:53,683
"Without you, darling,
everything seems unreal."

1190
01:36:53,741 --> 01:37:03,526
"Days and evenings
are spent in lonliness."

1191
01:37:03,617 --> 01:37:09,590
"Without you, darling.."

1192
01:37:14,528 --> 01:37:16,838
I'll click a photo too.

1193
01:37:17,264 --> 01:37:18,334
She can't take a photo!

1194
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:20,401
She can't take a photo!
Not her...not her...

1195
01:37:20,501 --> 01:37:22,139
Ajay let her click!

1196
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:24,741
Ajay!

1197
01:37:27,408 --> 01:37:28,819
Ajay!

1198
01:37:30,344 --> 01:37:33,291
Ajay, give me your hand!
Come on!

1199
01:37:34,048 --> 01:37:36,221
Bhaiya!
- Ajay!

1200
01:37:39,787 --> 01:37:41,460
Ajay don't be scared!

1201
01:37:42,223 --> 01:37:44,066
Bhaiya!

1202
01:37:44,325 --> 01:37:45,827
Give me your other hand!

1203
01:37:46,093 --> 01:37:47,902
Come on Ajay!

1204
01:37:47,962 --> 01:37:50,272
Take care of the kids.
- Kids, move!

1205
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:52,006
Ajay!

1206
01:37:52,399 --> 01:37:55,972
Ajay, give him your hand.
Be careful.

1207
01:38:13,854 --> 01:38:18,303
Now your teaching your
kid to take others' kids lives?

1208
01:38:18,626 --> 01:38:22,438
This teacher will only
remain your mistress!

1209
01:38:22,496 --> 01:38:24,874
If I see her again I'll kill her!

1210
01:38:24,965 --> 01:38:28,208
I'm not going to entertain
your first wife's son...

1211
01:38:28,302 --> 01:38:30,373
and your mistress!

1212
01:38:30,571 --> 01:38:34,644
'Since that day both the mothers
refused to send their children here.'

1213
01:38:34,742 --> 01:38:38,815
'The feud between the women
shattered the King's heart...'

1214
01:38:38,946 --> 01:38:44,692
'...he decided to divide his home,
properties and estate.'

1215
01:38:44,785 --> 01:38:46,731
'The children could no
longer meet each other...'

1216
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:50,893
'...and the Sheesh Mahal
was closed forever!'

1217
01:38:55,996 --> 01:38:59,773
I advised him to let the children
spend their childhood together...

1218
01:38:59,867 --> 01:39:02,473
...so that hatred would not affect them.

1219
01:39:02,536 --> 01:39:04,573
That's exactly what happened.

1220
01:39:05,172 --> 01:39:07,812
Spending one's
childhood with siblings...

1221
01:39:07,942 --> 01:39:13,221
...is as sacred as reciting
the 'Bhagwad Gita' or the 'Ramayana'.

1222
01:39:16,417 --> 01:39:20,263
You must have been a
saint in your past life Bapu.

1223
01:39:22,189 --> 01:39:25,966
Will you desert your
Bapu in such circumstances?

1224
01:39:27,962 --> 01:39:32,342
Mature Bapu,
now I want to hear your story.

1225
01:39:32,566 --> 01:39:37,276
The King had three women...
what about you?

1226
01:39:39,306 --> 01:39:41,411
Tell me Bapu!

1227
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:49,222
The simplicity you both have
is your biggest award Kanhaiya.

1228
01:39:50,484 --> 01:39:52,589
Tomorrow is the coronation...

1229
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:56,699
...since you've helped me so far,
please help a few days more...

1230
01:39:56,924 --> 01:39:59,928
...until we find the Prince.

1231
01:40:00,894 --> 01:40:06,344
If possible, return these siblings
their childhood...

1232
01:40:07,634 --> 01:40:13,676
...shower some of your love on them too.

1233
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:22,854
The royal honour is now
in your hands Prem Dilwale!

1234
01:40:32,226 --> 01:40:34,502
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

1235
01:40:34,561 --> 01:40:36,632
Glory to Princess Maithili!

1236
01:40:36,730 --> 01:40:38,937
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

1237
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:40,979
Glory to Princess Maithili!

1238
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:42,946
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

1239
01:40:43,003 --> 01:40:45,142
Glory to Princess Maithili!

1240
01:40:45,239 --> 01:40:47,446
Glory to Prince Vijay Singh!

1241
01:40:47,508 --> 01:40:49,886
Glory to Princess Maithili!

1242
01:41:00,687 --> 01:41:03,691
These two here? During the coronation?

1243
01:41:04,224 --> 01:41:08,468
Sir I've heard that this imposter
is giving them this palace today.

1244
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:09,332
What?

1245
01:41:09,396 --> 01:41:12,741
Calm down. Everyone will
get their share. Don't cry!

1246
01:41:16,603 --> 01:41:18,048
Chandrika?

1247
01:41:18,105 --> 01:41:21,143
I'll leave as soon as
my work is done uncle.

1248
01:41:24,912 --> 01:41:26,084
Sit here!

1249
01:42:01,682 --> 01:42:03,628
Respected guests...

1250
01:42:03,684 --> 01:42:09,327
...I've been bestowed with the responsibility
to officiate this historical event...

1251
01:42:10,023 --> 01:42:13,835
...in a few moments,
the Prince will be crowned...

1252
01:42:13,894 --> 01:42:18,309
...as per traditional
rituals and customs.

1253
01:42:18,732 --> 01:42:25,411
But before that I want
to read out the Prince's declaration.

1254
01:42:31,378 --> 01:42:33,380
'I want to apologize to all those...'

1255
01:42:33,647 --> 01:42:39,689
'...whom I have knowingly
or unknowingly hurt.'

1256
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:42,862
'Every family has
misunderstandings...'

1257
01:42:43,056 --> 01:42:47,129
'...and when your own hurt you,
it's far more painful.'

1258
01:42:47,594 --> 01:42:51,565
'I can't bring back
the time that's passed...'

1259
01:42:52,065 --> 01:42:54,875
'...but I can share the pain.'

1260
01:42:55,435 --> 01:42:58,143
'And in order to share
my sisters' pain...'

1261
01:42:58,939 --> 01:43:03,149
'...I want to gift them
this palace!'

1262
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:13,632
'Not just the palace, I would like to
share with my sisters...'

1263
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:17,324
'...everything that I have inherited.'

1264
01:43:19,993 --> 01:43:22,872
'Mansions in London and Switzerland...'

1265
01:43:22,963 --> 01:43:25,000
'...the Esha Nagar farmhouses...'

1266
01:43:25,098 --> 01:43:28,636
'Properties, jewellery and factories.'

1267
01:43:29,570 --> 01:43:33,245
'All the legal
documents are here...'

1268
01:43:33,473 --> 01:43:36,352
'...let's share everything together!'

1269
01:43:57,831 --> 01:44:01,870
Chandrika,
now you have a share in everything...

1270
01:44:02,102 --> 01:44:06,346
...as my share,
can I get my sister back?

1271
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:15,421
You're right Chandrika...

1272
01:44:15,482 --> 01:44:20,295
...brother, sister are just words.

1273
01:44:21,288 --> 01:44:25,031
What truly matters
is the brother sister bond...

1274
01:44:25,092 --> 01:44:28,471
...which gives you every
right to get upset...

1275
01:44:28,629 --> 01:44:33,100
...but no one can take
away my right to win you over.

1276
01:44:39,172 --> 01:44:42,847
I've heard that as a child,
when I used to play cricket...

1277
01:44:42,943 --> 01:44:48,291
...Chanda would insist on being
the first one to wish me good luck.

1278
01:44:48,915 --> 01:44:50,895
Remember Chanda?

1279
01:44:52,653 --> 01:44:56,100
And today when I'm
embarking on this journey...

1280
01:44:56,156 --> 01:44:58,727
...to take the traditions
of this family forward...

1281
01:44:58,825 --> 01:45:03,570
...won't you encourage me again Chanda?

1282
01:45:50,911 --> 01:45:53,790
If you still have any reservations...

1283
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:56,520
...then count me as an outsider.

1284
01:46:04,091 --> 01:46:09,507
"Happiness and sorrow
are not real."

1285
01:46:10,664 --> 01:46:15,704
"Wealth is not real either."

1286
01:46:16,803 --> 01:46:23,914
"And so are attachments."

1287
01:46:26,012 --> 01:46:31,012
"Real is the corner of the heart.."

1288
01:46:37,758 --> 01:46:44,767
"..that treasures love."

1289
01:46:45,565 --> 01:46:51,311
"That treasures love."

1290
01:47:32,212 --> 01:47:33,247
"I have found love."

1291
01:47:34,548 --> 01:47:35,618
"I have found love."

1292
01:47:36,917 --> 01:47:37,987
"Love has brought him."

1293
01:47:39,319 --> 01:47:40,354
"Love has taken over me."

1294
01:47:41,688 --> 01:47:42,792
"He has come."

1295
01:47:44,024 --> 01:47:45,196
"He sang."

1296
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:47,564
"I have found love."

1297
01:47:50,697 --> 01:47:55,510
"Darling, you are amazing
and your words."

1298
01:47:57,771 --> 01:48:02,083
"Darling, you are amazing
and your words."

1299
01:48:02,409 --> 01:48:06,858
"Rubbed off me
have these qualities of yours."

1300
01:48:06,947 --> 01:48:11,623
"I have found love."

1301
01:48:11,685 --> 01:48:15,565
"I have found love."

1302
01:48:15,622 --> 01:48:18,000
"I have found
the treasure of love."

1303
01:48:18,058 --> 01:48:20,402
"I have found
the treasure of love."

1304
01:48:20,627 --> 01:48:22,800
"Our meeting seems inevitable."

1305
01:48:22,863 --> 01:48:24,365
"I have found
the treasure of love."

1306
01:48:25,232 --> 01:48:30,341
"I have found
the treasure of love."

1307
01:49:08,975 --> 01:49:17,793
"Do I express or suppress my love?"

1308
01:49:18,485 --> 01:49:27,269
"I wonder why I feel so exited."

1309
01:49:27,961 --> 01:49:32,603
"Happiness is everywhere."

1310
01:49:32,666 --> 01:49:37,172
"I am blushing red."

1311
01:49:37,404 --> 01:49:41,875
"Rubbed off me
have these qualities of yours."

1312
01:49:41,942 --> 01:49:46,687
"I have found love."

1313
01:49:46,746 --> 01:49:50,626
"I have found love."

1314
01:49:50,717 --> 01:49:53,061
"I have found the treasure of love."

1315
01:49:53,119 --> 01:49:55,429
"I have found the treasure of love."

1316
01:49:55,522 --> 01:49:57,695
"I am in seventh heaven."

1317
01:49:57,891 --> 01:49:59,336
"Treasure of love."

1318
01:50:00,260 --> 01:50:05,369
"I have found the treasure of love."

1319
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:07,635
"Love has taken over me."

1320
01:50:09,002 --> 01:50:10,106
"He has come."

1321
01:50:11,338 --> 01:50:12,544
"Love has brought him."

1322
01:50:13,740 --> 01:50:14,912
"He has come."

1323
01:50:16,109 --> 01:50:17,452
"Love has brought him."

1324
01:50:18,478 --> 01:50:19,548
"I have found love."

1325
01:50:20,814 --> 01:50:22,054
"Love has taken over me."

1326
01:50:23,216 --> 01:50:24,422
"He has come."

1327
01:50:25,652 --> 01:50:26,756
"Love has brought him."

1328
01:50:28,021 --> 01:50:29,159
"I have found love."

1329
01:50:30,323 --> 01:50:31,825
"I have found love."

1330
01:50:35,829 --> 01:50:37,866
There's some time for this too!

1331
01:50:48,041 --> 01:50:49,179
Listen.

1332
01:50:51,511 --> 01:50:53,115
How do I look?

1333
01:50:53,213 --> 01:50:54,692
<i>MY god...</i>

1334
01:50:54,748 --> 01:50:56,159
...careful!

1335
01:50:56,916 --> 01:50:58,020
Here you go.

1336
01:50:58,118 --> 01:51:00,689
If I knew you opened a
restaurant here every night...

1337
01:51:00,787 --> 01:51:02,266
...then I would have
given you company.

1338
01:51:02,322 --> 01:51:03,323
What's the name of your restaurant?

1339
01:51:03,390 --> 01:51:06,200
Prem Dilwala Restaurant.
- Nice name.

1340
01:51:06,259 --> 01:51:08,296
What was the menu day before?
- Vegetable Curry.

1341
01:51:08,461 --> 01:51:11,340
And yesterday?
- Baked peas.

1342
01:51:11,398 --> 01:51:14,106
And today?
- Buttered Okra.

1343
01:51:14,167 --> 01:51:16,147
Buttered Okra!
- Yes.

1344
01:51:18,238 --> 01:51:19,842
Sometimes you don't
act like a Princess.

1345
01:51:19,906 --> 01:51:23,581
Why? Have I become too
naughty these days? - No, no!

1346
01:51:30,517 --> 01:51:35,967
The thing is...when I'm happy
I become free!

1347
01:51:39,025 --> 01:51:40,834
But now I'll be a good girl.

1348
01:51:40,927 --> 01:51:44,033
I want to eat okra too.
- No it's too spicy.

1349
01:51:44,864 --> 01:51:47,538
'It's all in the mind!'

1350
01:51:52,472 --> 01:51:55,851
Please sit up...
- Never!

1351
01:51:56,242 --> 01:51:58,518
We have to share everything.

1352
01:52:09,389 --> 01:52:11,494
We'll share everything...

1353
01:52:11,591 --> 01:52:14,197
...highs and lows, ups and downs!

1354
01:52:36,516 --> 01:52:40,157
I want to drink water too.
- Right away.

1355
01:53:05,378 --> 01:53:09,758
These lamps are complaining today...

1356
01:53:09,816 --> 01:53:13,286
'Why hasn't the wedding
date been fixed yet?'

1357
01:53:13,386 --> 01:53:17,129
The couple doesn't
get to fix the date...

1358
01:53:18,091 --> 01:53:20,537
...your grandma will fix it.

1359
01:53:27,033 --> 01:53:29,035
You know...

1360
01:53:30,203 --> 01:53:35,619
...I sometimes get the feeling
that you're not the same man...

1361
01:53:35,975 --> 01:53:38,182
...that you're someone else...

1362
01:53:38,244 --> 01:53:41,123
...who's come from far away...

1363
01:53:41,214 --> 01:53:44,286
...to take my loneliness away!

1364
01:53:45,585 --> 01:53:47,531
But you know what...

1365
01:53:48,454 --> 01:53:50,331
...who cares...!

1366
01:53:52,358 --> 01:53:55,396
That day I made you write
several complaints...

1367
01:53:55,461 --> 01:53:59,534
...today I'll speak again and you write...

1368
01:54:00,166 --> 01:54:02,578
...but this time on my back!

1369
01:54:06,272 --> 01:54:11,272
"Had it been
the night of our union.."

1370
01:54:22,422 --> 01:54:29,897
"..I wonder
what would have happened."

1371
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:40,950
"I wonder what would
have happened."

1372
01:54:54,187 --> 01:54:59,967
"Love brings with it
a strange kind of yearning."

1373
01:55:00,593 --> 01:55:06,407
"A yearning evident
in the mind, body, and eyes."

1374
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:12,043
"Darling, come to me."

1375
01:55:12,772 --> 01:55:21,317
"Darling, come to me.
I long for you."

1376
01:55:21,881 --> 01:55:30,960
"I want to spend my life with you."

1377
01:55:50,143 --> 01:55:52,953
There's no need to be
so reserved in love.

1378
01:56:03,289 --> 01:56:06,099
Queens used to get adorned here...

1379
01:56:06,359 --> 01:56:09,533
...won't you adorn your Queen tonight?

1380
01:56:16,469 --> 01:56:25,878
"This kind of yearning
sometimes leads to destruction."

1381
01:56:32,118 --> 01:56:38,501
"A clean image gets marred."

1382
01:56:44,764 --> 01:56:51,147
"Examples of change of heart
are a many."

1383
01:56:51,204 --> 01:56:56,586
"Beautiful dreams make me yearn."

1384
01:56:57,477 --> 01:57:03,018
"Yearning full of
need and indulgence."

1385
01:57:03,716 --> 01:57:11,794
"Come to me, darling.
I yearn for you."

1386
01:57:12,358 --> 01:57:21,904
"I want to spend my life with you."

1387
01:57:30,543 --> 01:57:32,955
Remember this place?

1388
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:38,456
It's the same place
where I fought with you...

1389
01:57:38,751 --> 01:57:41,061
...over something...

1390
01:57:42,789 --> 01:57:47,534
...imagine that the same
barbecue is set up there...

1391
01:57:49,729 --> 01:57:52,972
...I've worn your favourite
dress again...

1392
01:57:53,066 --> 01:57:54,568
...and...

1393
01:58:00,640 --> 01:58:10,118
"Your love and affection
is not meant for me."

1394
01:58:16,389 --> 01:58:22,772
"Stop yourself
from getting attracted to me."

1395
01:58:29,001 --> 01:58:35,350
"Undeserved love will
take away peace of mind."

1396
01:58:35,441 --> 01:58:40,823
"Feel the yearning in my breath."

1397
01:58:41,681 --> 01:58:47,427
"The tinkling of my anklets and bangles
give away the yearning inside me."

1398
01:58:48,054 --> 01:58:50,432
"Come to me, darling."

1399
01:58:53,359 --> 01:58:56,169
"I yearn for you."

1400
01:58:56,596 --> 01:59:05,448
"I want to spend my life with you."

1401
01:59:07,173 --> 01:59:12,919
"I want to spend my life with you."

1402
01:59:12,979 --> 01:59:19,157
"I want to spend my life with you."

1403
01:59:19,418 --> 01:59:24,766
"I want to spend my life with you."

1404
01:59:24,857 --> 01:59:31,741
"I want to spend.."

1405
01:59:31,797 --> 01:59:36,075
"..my life with you."

1406
01:59:40,973 --> 01:59:46,047
What if I tell you
I have no right to this?

1407
01:59:49,148 --> 01:59:55,064
The love I gave you in these
past four days was false, Princess.

1408
02:00:15,308 --> 02:00:21,918
Grandma says that true love resides
not on the lips...but in the eyes...

1409
02:00:22,949 --> 02:00:27,864
...and your eyes are reflecting
your true love, Your Majesty!

1410
02:00:38,731 --> 02:00:40,768
Deewan Saheb!

1411
02:00:42,401 --> 02:00:43,937
Who is it?

1412
02:00:53,546 --> 02:00:55,548
Your Highness?

1413
02:00:55,715 --> 02:00:58,252
I'm back Deewan Saheb...

1414
02:00:58,317 --> 02:01:00,058
...I'm back.

1415
02:01:02,054 --> 02:01:03,658
Your Highness!

1416
02:01:12,231 --> 02:01:13,335
Dilwale?

1417
02:01:13,566 --> 02:01:18,106
Bapu, I can deceive you as the Prince...

1418
02:01:19,905 --> 02:01:23,250
...but I can't deceive
the Princess anymore.

1419
02:01:24,543 --> 02:01:32,223
Bapu, let the pride of the
royal family stay in the royal family.

1420
02:01:35,888 --> 02:01:38,562
Why did I come here to meet her?

1421
02:01:38,658 --> 02:01:40,638
Why did I stay here?

1422
02:01:41,027 --> 02:01:43,633
Why couldn't I understand this before?

1423
02:01:44,397 --> 02:01:48,368
Bapu, we must bring the Prince back.

1424
02:01:49,669 --> 02:01:51,649
So you...?
- Sir.

1425
02:01:53,272 --> 02:01:56,082
What is it Sanjay?
Any news of the Prince?

1426
02:01:56,142 --> 02:01:57,485
No sir.

1427
02:01:57,777 --> 02:02:03,022
But there's someone who claims
he can take us to the Prince.

1428
02:02:03,616 --> 02:02:06,495
Happy Diwali Deewan Saheb.

1429
02:02:08,254 --> 02:02:10,393
Prem Dilwale.

1430
02:02:13,359 --> 02:02:15,498
Prem Dilwala.

1431
02:02:15,795 --> 02:02:17,934
City Ayodhya.

1432
02:02:18,397 --> 02:02:20,343
Devotee of Lord Rama.

1433
02:02:20,700 --> 02:02:23,977
I must admit Deewan Saheb...

1434
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:28,482
...that even at this age
you did all this so cleverly.

1435
02:02:28,574 --> 02:02:31,077
But you made one mistake...

1436
02:02:32,345 --> 02:02:39,490
...you kept an 80 year old watchman
to take care of the Prince!

1437
02:03:10,649 --> 02:03:16,429
The effect of the injection
will last 3 to 4 hours. Take him away!

1438
02:03:25,998 --> 02:03:29,411
Congratulations Prem Dilwale.

1439
02:03:29,502 --> 02:03:32,244
Your desire is fulfilled.

1440
02:03:33,305 --> 02:03:36,047
Now the Princess can be yours.

1441
02:03:36,108 --> 02:03:40,579
The Princess can be yours.

1442
02:03:41,847 --> 02:03:43,827
Every loyal person
has the same fate.

1443
02:03:45,384 --> 02:03:48,422
Get to the point.
Why have you come here?

1444
02:03:48,487 --> 02:03:53,368
I'll take Dilwale to the same
place where I'm holding the Prince.

1445
02:03:53,459 --> 02:03:56,804
In exchange,
I want Chuttan's freedom.

1446
02:03:56,962 --> 02:03:58,373
And for one day tomorrow...

1447
02:03:58,431 --> 02:04:02,345
...I want Kanhaiya and
Dilwala in the same roles...

1448
02:04:02,401 --> 02:04:04,574
...that you've had them play so far.

1449
02:04:04,670 --> 02:04:05,740
Why?

1450
02:04:05,871 --> 02:04:08,784
It's Diwali time Deewan Saheb.

1451
02:04:09,408 --> 02:04:13,823
Let's play a few rounds of cards.
What do you say Dilwale?

1452
02:04:16,415 --> 02:04:19,396
Does Ajay know you're here?

1453
02:04:19,685 --> 02:04:21,824
What...Sanjay?

1454
02:04:24,123 --> 02:04:25,534
Get out of here!

1455
02:04:25,891 --> 02:04:27,962
You're one of Ajay's best friends...

1456
02:04:28,060 --> 02:04:30,165
...at least don't deceive him!

1457
02:04:30,262 --> 02:04:33,402
Get out!
We don't accept your deal.

1458
02:04:35,267 --> 02:04:37,838
I'll come with you.

1459
02:04:40,105 --> 02:04:43,450
Allow me one more mistake
Deewan Saheb.

1460
02:04:44,910 --> 02:04:47,083
For the Princess' sake!

1461
02:04:51,951 --> 02:04:53,624
You r majesty?

1462
02:04:56,822 --> 02:04:58,358
Vijav?

1463
02:05:00,826 --> 02:05:04,968
'I'm going out to
get your wedding gift!'

1464
02:05:24,583 --> 02:05:27,894
Here's that Sheesh Mahal...

1465
02:05:36,896 --> 02:05:39,740
...this is where Vijay
Singh is imprisoned.

1466
02:05:39,798 --> 02:05:43,541
Ajay is celebrating
Chuttan's freedom here.

1467
02:05:46,205 --> 02:05:48,151
Freedom!

1468
02:05:51,777 --> 02:05:52,847
Hey!

1469
02:05:59,218 --> 02:06:01,425
Someone else is here today...

1470
02:06:01,487 --> 02:06:05,492
...who wants to be a
part of your happiness.

1471
02:06:06,659 --> 02:06:10,163
Sir now that we've
achieved our goal...

1472
02:06:10,429 --> 02:06:13,137
...what orders do
you have for this poor soul?

1473
02:06:13,198 --> 02:06:16,839
Deewan Saheb turned
him into a puppet.

1474
02:06:33,252 --> 02:06:41,194
Under my reign, no one has
to dance to anyone's tunes.

1475
02:06:53,005 --> 02:06:54,279
Sir.

1476
02:06:55,107 --> 02:07:00,022
Sir to make today's victory
memorable, let's take a picture...

1477
02:07:00,045 --> 02:07:02,025
...with you dressed in
the Late King's attire.

1478
02:07:02,181 --> 02:07:05,890
I've got the dress here and
I've got a great photographer.

1479
02:07:05,951 --> 02:07:07,487
Mr. Masoorie!

1480
02:07:07,720 --> 02:07:10,064
Greetings.
- Come on.

1481
02:07:28,674 --> 02:07:30,381
Follow me!

1482
02:07:30,609 --> 02:07:34,250
I want to see these
two brothers battle.

1483
02:07:34,313 --> 02:07:36,020
Just like it's in the books.

1484
02:07:36,181 --> 02:07:40,459
Whoever dies, one will
end up in the royal cemetery...

1485
02:07:40,686 --> 02:07:44,463
...and the other will
be royally escorted to jail.

1486
02:07:44,890 --> 02:07:50,203
The Late King built this mirror
maze for his children to play in...

1487
02:07:50,262 --> 02:07:55,473
...little did he know that one
day his lineage would end here.

1488
02:08:11,483 --> 02:08:18,059
This is Vijay Singh's fury...
eager to avenge every traitor!

1489
02:08:23,128 --> 02:08:26,109
Here's the key to his freedom...

1490
02:08:26,532 --> 02:08:31,743
...if you can, save your Lord Rama
from committing a sin!

1491
02:08:58,497 --> 02:09:00,272
RBI-i Bhaiya!

1492
02:09:07,773 --> 02:09:09,810
'Congratulations Prem Dilwale!'

1493
02:09:09,875 --> 02:09:12,014
'Now the Princess can be yours.'

1494
02:09:12,111 --> 02:09:13,954
'The Princess can be yours.'

1495
02:09:14,012 --> 02:09:15,855
'The Princess can be yours.'

1496
02:09:23,489 --> 02:09:27,801
Dilwale...the Princess can be yours.

1497
02:09:40,606 --> 02:09:44,281
My not trusting you...means your death.

1498
02:09:44,576 --> 02:09:47,284
Aren't you scared of death?

1499
02:09:47,679 --> 02:09:51,525
If I had made a mistake...I
would be scared.

1500
02:09:55,687 --> 02:09:59,999
I've come to take you
back to your Princess...

1501
02:10:00,225 --> 02:10:01,966
...where your sisters
are waiting for you...

1502
02:10:02,828 --> 02:10:05,672
...your family is waiting for you.

1503
02:10:05,798 --> 02:10:07,175
No!

1504
02:10:07,432 --> 02:10:11,608
I have no family!
They're all selfish!

1505
02:10:12,070 --> 02:10:15,847
A brother goes to meet his sister,
but she calls a lawyer!

1506
02:10:15,908 --> 02:10:17,979
A brother tries to kill his brother!

1507
02:10:18,043 --> 02:10:20,148
Is this what you call a family?

1508
02:10:20,345 --> 02:10:22,416
I'll kill Ajay!

1509
02:10:24,149 --> 02:10:29,462
Why do you want to tarnish the
reputation of the princess' fiance?

1510
02:10:34,993 --> 02:10:37,269
Every family has problems...

1511
02:10:37,496 --> 02:10:41,467
...but blessed are
those who have a family!

1512
02:10:42,668 --> 02:10:44,579
Well said Dilwale!

1513
02:10:44,636 --> 02:10:47,116
But families also have a rule...

1514
02:10:47,206 --> 02:10:51,086
...the one at fault gets punished!

1515
02:10:51,143 --> 02:10:53,316
Wait Raja Bhaiya!
- Enough!

1516
02:10:53,612 --> 02:10:58,618
For your sake I'll give Ajay Singh
an opportunity...to put up a fight!

1517
02:11:07,092 --> 02:11:08,730
RBI-i Bhaiya!

1518
02:11:09,728 --> 02:11:11,435
Stop, Raja Bhaiya!

1519
02:11:28,413 --> 02:11:32,156
You managed to escape one maze...

1520
02:11:32,718 --> 02:11:36,666
...but fate won't always favour you.

1521
02:11:40,359 --> 02:11:43,363
Now no one can stop the battle!

1522
02:11:56,742 --> 02:11:58,244
Get up!

1523
02:12:10,289 --> 02:12:12,565
Get up Bhaisaheb!

1524
02:12:54,366 --> 02:12:55,606
Forgive me!

1525
02:13:47,352 --> 02:13:51,926
"Friendship with brother,
fun with sisters."

1526
02:13:51,990 --> 02:13:56,496
"A heart like a kite in the sky."

1527
02:13:56,595 --> 02:14:01,135
"All these were
relationships of the heart."

1528
02:14:01,233 --> 02:14:05,511
"With neither doubt nor jealousy."

1529
02:14:05,771 --> 02:14:10,083
"There were no disagreements"

1530
02:14:10,142 --> 02:14:15,182
"Mirro, take me back
to my childhood."

1531
02:14:54,152 --> 02:14:56,063
Raja Bhaiya, enough!

1532
02:14:56,588 --> 02:14:57,896
He's your brother.

1533
02:14:57,989 --> 02:14:59,696
He's my enemy!

1534
02:15:00,559 --> 02:15:03,733
If that's so,
then excuse me.

1535
02:15:20,712 --> 02:15:25,718
Why such brotherly love for
your enemy, Raja Bhaiya?

1536
02:15:30,722 --> 02:15:35,102
If you hit it's a punishment.
But if someone else hits it's a crime.

1537
02:15:35,260 --> 02:15:38,207
This only happens in blood relations...

1538
02:15:38,363 --> 02:15:40,070
...in families.

1539
02:15:41,199 --> 02:15:43,145
That's not true!

1540
02:15:44,236 --> 02:15:47,012
If that's not true...
then there's your brother...

1541
02:15:47,072 --> 02:15:49,074
...go kill him!

1542
02:15:58,984 --> 02:16:04,161
Raja Bhaiya, you're still
hiding your feelings...

1543
02:16:04,322 --> 02:16:06,461
...why don't you tell your brother...

1544
02:16:06,525 --> 02:16:10,371
...'I'm very lonely!
Let's go home.'

1545
02:16:11,730 --> 02:16:15,542
And you,
look into your brother's eyes!

1546
02:16:15,967 --> 02:16:21,144
Is it possible that he wouldn't
fulfill any of your desires?

1547
02:16:21,306 --> 02:16:25,982
You let the world convince you
to kill your own brother?

1548
02:16:29,247 --> 02:16:31,523
All you siblings are
bound by the same link...

1549
02:16:31,583 --> 02:16:35,725
...you're all looking for that same love
that you lost in this Sheesh Mahal...

1550
02:16:35,787 --> 02:16:38,791
...only your ways of looking are wrong!

1551
02:17:39,484 --> 02:17:40,929
Bhaiya!

1552
02:18:10,081 --> 02:18:12,618
What are you doing here?
Get lost!

1553
02:18:13,251 --> 02:18:15,424
Anyone else?

1554
02:18:35,640 --> 02:18:39,679
How do brothers ask for
forgiveness, Bhaisaheb?

1555
02:18:39,911 --> 02:18:42,323
By hugging each other.

1556
02:18:43,214 --> 02:18:47,526
Then hug me gently,
I'm in a lot of pain.

1557
02:18:47,886 --> 02:18:50,059
Come here!

1558
02:19:10,041 --> 02:19:13,284
It's not over yet Your Highness!

1559
02:20:18,977 --> 02:20:24,689
'Imagine that I've worn your
favourite dress again...and...'

1560
02:21:03,788 --> 02:21:06,598
You can go in Princess.

1561
02:21:07,192 --> 02:21:11,265
To the one, who truly belongs to you.

1562
02:21:15,667 --> 02:21:20,616
Forgive me, but the one you
were spending time with so far...

1563
02:21:20,805 --> 02:21:22,716
had been planted by me.

1564
02:22:10,321 --> 02:22:13,063
The old wounds have healed completely.

1565
02:22:13,258 --> 02:22:19,265
Now His Majesty needs
to eat and rest well.

1566
02:22:20,431 --> 02:22:23,207
Goodnight sir.
- Goodnight Doctor.

1567
02:22:36,147 --> 02:22:40,926
I am sorry that you had
to go through this embarrassment.

1568
02:22:45,056 --> 02:22:46,364
Thank you!

1569
02:22:47,859 --> 02:22:52,308
Your Majesty,
Dilwala is here to see you.

1570
02:22:56,801 --> 02:22:58,109
Just a second.

1571
02:23:00,071 --> 02:23:02,381
You want to go inside for a bit?

1572
02:23:03,775 --> 02:23:05,254
Thank you.

1573
02:23:06,878 --> 02:23:09,518
Deewan Saheb, send him in.

1574
02:23:17,288 --> 02:23:22,169
Your Majesty, before anyone
discovers our secret...

1575
02:23:22,360 --> 02:23:24,966
...Dilwala has come to take your leave.

1576
02:23:28,032 --> 02:23:32,503
Okay...Papa's car will go drop him
Deewan Saheb.

1577
02:23:32,604 --> 02:23:33,674
Yes.

1578
02:23:34,472 --> 02:23:36,076
Goodbye Sir.

1579
02:23:40,678 --> 02:23:44,649
Dilwale,
you've broken many traditions...

1580
02:23:44,716 --> 02:23:47,959
...you made the royal
guests play footballm.

1581
02:23:48,052 --> 02:23:52,194
...you told everyone thatl
used to bathe naked in the lake!

1582
02:23:55,627 --> 02:23:58,699
And you didn't keep
a moustache either...

1583
02:24:00,031 --> 02:24:01,374
...why?

1584
02:24:02,567 --> 02:24:06,674
Sir, it made your Princess happy!

1585
02:24:12,877 --> 02:24:17,485
Thank you...I can't
stop you from leaving...

1586
02:24:17,715 --> 02:24:22,095
...but tell me, what can I do for you.

1587
02:24:25,056 --> 02:24:27,730
You're a very good son...

1588
02:24:28,092 --> 02:24:30,197
...you're a very good brother...

1589
02:24:30,962 --> 02:24:33,772
...can't you be that companion...

1590
02:24:35,133 --> 02:24:38,774
that the Princess
is looking for in you?

1591
02:24:45,143 --> 02:24:48,488
Okay, I will try my best.

1592
02:24:49,580 --> 02:24:52,561
Raja Bhaiya, one more request...

1593
02:24:57,588 --> 02:24:58,931
Kanhaiya!

1594
02:24:59,490 --> 02:25:01,800
Give me this...
- No this one.

1595
02:25:07,832 --> 02:25:11,211
We had brought these
gifts for the Princess, will you...

1596
02:25:11,335 --> 02:25:12,780
Sure.

1597
02:26:04,922 --> 02:26:07,960
Bapu, I'll take your leave.

1598
02:26:11,229 --> 02:26:15,041
Do visit us some day...for quality time!

1599
02:26:20,171 --> 02:26:23,584
And Bapu you didn't
answer that question.

1600
02:26:23,674 --> 02:26:27,850
You can tell me today...
I'm leaving and there's nobody around.

1601
02:26:30,915 --> 02:26:37,332
While taking care of the royal family,
I didn't get any time...

1602
02:26:40,291 --> 02:26:43,795
Now if you ask anything else
I'll slap you!

1603
02:26:56,274 --> 02:26:58,481
Go away from here...go!

1604
02:27:13,457 --> 02:27:14,697
Sit.

1605
02:27:36,214 --> 02:27:44,258
"You are as enchanting as
all the scriptures put together."

1606
02:27:48,292 --> 02:27:56,074
"A symbol of virtue and truth,
just like Sita."

1607
02:28:45,316 --> 02:28:48,092
<i>Um!</i>

1608
02:28:50,488 --> 02:28:52,161
New drama?

1609
02:28:53,391 --> 02:28:55,098
Come friends.

1610
02:28:55,259 --> 02:28:58,433
Take your seats...faster!

1611
02:28:59,797 --> 02:29:01,401
Dear friends...

1612
02:29:01,666 --> 02:29:07,344
...early morning Lord Vishnu
visited me in my dream!

1613
02:29:07,705 --> 02:29:10,345
He said 'Chaubey...hey Chaubey!'

1614
02:29:11,042 --> 02:29:12,680
'Become pure.'

1615
02:29:12,777 --> 02:29:16,725
And he also said that...

1616
02:29:16,814 --> 02:29:22,526
...'Chaubey you should stay
in touch with the rich and famous!'

1617
02:29:22,620 --> 02:29:25,157
So why don't you invite
the King here sometime?

1618
02:29:25,356 --> 02:29:28,303
Or better still, take me there...

1619
02:29:28,359 --> 02:29:30,396
...for tea...

1620
02:29:31,329 --> 02:29:33,570
Om!
<i>'</i> No!

1621
02:29:33,731 --> 02:29:35,335
Oh!

1622
02:29:35,933 --> 02:29:37,674
Chaubey uncle.

1623
02:29:37,868 --> 02:29:41,873
Prem Bhaiya,
Grandma from the royal family is here...

1624
02:29:50,915 --> 02:29:52,656
Grandma!

1625
02:30:11,268 --> 02:30:15,444
In all these years I've never
seen such a blissful Diwali.

1626
02:30:15,506 --> 02:30:17,508
The royal family of Pritampur...

1627
02:30:17,608 --> 02:30:22,614
...is joyfully celebrating
unique festivities...

1628
02:30:22,680 --> 02:30:24,853
...all because of you!

1629
02:30:28,252 --> 02:30:31,392
You've given us this gift...

1630
02:30:31,589 --> 02:30:35,127
...and there is a tradition
in our royal families...

1631
02:30:35,192 --> 02:30:39,698
...we give a gift
in exchange of a gift!

1632
02:31:16,534 --> 02:31:18,070
Dilwale.

1633
02:31:18,803 --> 02:31:22,580
We fought a lot after
we got engaged...

1634
02:31:22,706 --> 02:31:26,017
...we tried to humiliate each other.

1635
02:31:26,077 --> 02:31:32,494
But after you left, I tried
to be the one you asked me to be...

1636
02:31:37,955 --> 02:31:42,461
...and I said nothing to
her, nor did I interrupt her...

1637
02:31:43,094 --> 02:31:45,404
...just listened.

1638
02:31:45,763 --> 02:31:49,301
And we both came to
the conclusion that...

1639
02:31:50,134 --> 02:31:55,641
...the companion that our Princess
has been looking for...

1640
02:31:56,140 --> 02:31:58,677
...is our very own Dilwala.

1641
02:31:59,143 --> 02:32:01,020
Prem Dilwala!

1642
02:32:05,149 --> 02:32:09,222
The Princess belongs
to the royal family.

1643
02:32:09,286 --> 02:32:11,698
If the royal family
is what's separating us...

1644
02:32:11,755 --> 02:32:15,703
...then you'll have to
include us in your family today.

1645
02:32:15,759 --> 02:32:21,266
As you know, I don't know
how to talk filmy nor do I like it...

1646
02:32:21,365 --> 02:32:23,572
...but I'm still trying.

1647
02:32:23,968 --> 02:32:28,383
Two days after Diwali,
today is Bhaidooj (Brother's Day)...

1648
02:32:29,573 --> 02:32:32,076
...we'll celebrate it this year!

1649
02:33:14,218 --> 02:33:16,425
Sisters celebrate this festival...

1650
02:33:17,288 --> 02:33:20,292
...but it's called Brother's Day...

1651
02:33:23,227 --> 02:33:29,041
...this brother too wants to be
a part of your family!

1652
02:33:36,874 --> 02:33:39,013
Our families are no longer separate...

1653
02:33:39,076 --> 02:33:43,286
we are now one family...
which Prem has brought together!

1654
02:33:44,648 --> 02:33:46,650
Any other order?

1655
02:33:54,992 --> 02:33:58,405
"My heart beats faster."

1656
02:34:00,297 --> 02:34:04,006
"My heart is racing."

1657
02:34:17,781 --> 02:34:23,356
"He's with me. I like him.
I will accept whatever he likes."

1658
02:34:23,420 --> 02:34:29,132
"He means more to me than my life.
I will do everything for him."

1659
02:34:31,962 --> 02:34:37,640
"He's with me. I like him.
I will accept whatever he likes."

1660
02:34:37,701 --> 02:34:43,447
"He means more to me than my life.
I will do everything for him."

1661
02:34:45,909 --> 02:34:51,484
"Let me buy something sweet
and spicy, something he likes."

1662
02:34:51,582 --> 02:34:57,123
"Let me buy some
snacks and confectionary."

1663
02:34:57,621 --> 02:35:03,196
"I have to say it to him today."

1664
02:35:03,260 --> 02:35:08,869
"I have to say it to him today."

1665
02:35:15,839 --> 02:35:17,375
"I have found the treasure of love."

1666
02:35:17,741 --> 02:35:20,517
"I have found the treasure of love."

1667
02:35:20,577 --> 02:35:24,457
"I feel overwhelmed
on finding my love."

1668
02:35:25,349 --> 02:35:29,923
"I have found the treasure of love."

1669
02:35:29,987 --> 02:35:34,333
"I have found the treasure of love."

1670
02:35:34,692 --> 02:35:38,765
"I feel overwhelmed
on finding my love."

1671
02:35:39,496 --> 02:35:44,377
"I have found the treasure of love."

1672
02:36:01,719 --> 02:36:10,867
"Darkness was all around me.
My dear ones were far away."

1673
02:36:11,562 --> 02:36:20,482
"I know now the value of
dreams and relationships."

1674
02:36:21,105 --> 02:36:25,815
"I understand love now."

1675
02:36:25,909 --> 02:36:30,153
"Nobody cared for me
like you did."

1676
02:36:30,447 --> 02:36:34,953
"Rubbed off me
have these qualities of yours."

1677
02:36:35,018 --> 02:36:39,660
"I have found love."

1678
02:36:39,757 --> 02:36:43,637
"I have found love."

1679
02:36:43,827 --> 02:36:46,103
"I have found the treasure of love."

1680
02:36:46,163 --> 02:36:48,473
"I have found the treasure of love."

1681
02:36:48,532 --> 02:36:52,378
"I feel overwhelmed
that I have found love."

1682
02:36:53,303 --> 02:36:58,582
"I have found the treasure of love."

1683
02:36:59,576 --> 02:37:00,611
"He conquered."

1684
02:37:01,979 --> 02:37:03,151
"He came."

1685
02:37:04,248 --> 02:37:05,420
"He brought love."

1686
02:37:06,683 --> 02:37:07,787
"I have found love."

1687
02:37:09,019 --> 02:37:10,498
"I have found love."
