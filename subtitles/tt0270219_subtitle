1
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:31,343
Good morning Ms. Nisha,

2
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:33,718
we heard you met the
Prime Minister in Delhi?

3
00:01:33,808 --> 00:01:38,147
It was my pleasure talking
with him. - What did you talk?

4
00:01:38,237 --> 00:01:42,808
You don't talk to
PM but listen to him.

5
00:01:43,757 --> 00:01:46,280
Are you establishing
a computer unit in America?

6
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:51,135
Yes, I am. But not in
America but in this country.

7
00:01:51,225 --> 00:01:53,835
My ventures will be only in India.

8
00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:57,432
As a woman how do you handle
all these responsibilities?

9
00:01:59,392 --> 00:02:02,588
Like a woman should!
Excuse me please.

10
00:02:12,158 --> 00:02:15,232
Sir, the lawyer is
waiting for you. - Lawyer?!

11
00:02:25,682 --> 00:02:28,328
Lawyer!
- Mr. Khanna!

12
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:32,843
Where did you go?

13
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:34,232
Airport.
- Airport?

14
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:37,713
To see Ms. Nisha. A fantastic lady!

15
00:02:38,547 --> 00:02:43,281
Come give me your report.

16
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:46,090
First listen to the conclusion.

17
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:51,244
Ms Nisha Singh will never become
Mrs. Khanna. - Why?

18
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:55,552
What's wrong with the name Khanna?
- Nothing!

19
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,766
What's wrong is your unlimited

20
00:02:58,451 --> 00:03:01,771
wealth, 20 cars and villas!

21
00:03:01,861 --> 00:03:04,676
Your business and
millions in banks.

22
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:08,343
You mean my attributes
are my weaknesses?

23
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:11,366
Is Ms Nisha a communist?

24
00:03:11,456 --> 00:03:17,231
No, she believes that rich
men can't be good husbands.

25
00:03:18,443 --> 00:03:21,532
She believes that successful men,

26
00:03:21,622 --> 00:03:25,153
love their success
more than their wives.

27
00:03:25,912 --> 00:03:27,272
That's the limit!

28
00:03:27,362 --> 00:03:31,355
She doesn't understand life!

29
00:03:31,757 --> 00:03:36,267
A traumatic incident
has made her this way.

30
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,891
Her parent's are divorced.

31
00:03:39,657 --> 00:03:42,850
The divorce has
affected her mentally.

32
00:03:43,552 --> 00:03:47,310
How do you know all this?
- Wow.

33
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:51,356
The one who asked me to
enquire is questioning me!

34
00:03:52,402 --> 00:03:55,642
After thinking about it for 3 days,
I came to a conclusion that

35
00:03:56,156 --> 00:04:01,717
in order to know her, I would
need to befriend her close friend.

36
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:08,091
On investigating I found that
Nisha had only one close friend.

37
00:04:09,013 --> 00:04:12,017
Ms. Aruna Chaudhary.

38
00:04:12,107 --> 00:04:14,897
And who is Ms. Aruna Chaudhary?

39
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:19,940
Nisha's personal
secretary and only friend.

40
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:27,136
Mr. Khanna,
if your Nisha is wonderful,

41
00:04:27,816 --> 00:04:29,969
my Aruna is no less.

42
00:04:30,214 --> 00:04:31,219
Lawyer,

43
00:04:31,954 --> 00:04:37,065
you talk as if something's going
on between you and Ms. Aruna..

44
00:04:37,215 --> 00:04:41,107
I'm not a billionaire playboy
like you, but an ordinary lawyer.

45
00:04:41,743 --> 00:04:44,095
I'll marry Aruna soon.

46
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:46,139
Congratulations once again!

47
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,695
Could you forget your love for a
while,

48
00:04:49,785 --> 00:04:53,344
And tell me about Nisha?

49
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:56,890
Yes sure, take this.

50
00:04:58,232 --> 00:05:01,968
Her life history. Ms Nisha Singh.

51
00:05:13,238 --> 00:05:14,336
Good morning!

52
00:05:15,634 --> 00:05:18,976
Good morning Aruna!
All set? Let's go.

53
00:05:52,136 --> 00:05:54,840
That way?!

54
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,375
C'mon fast!

55
00:06:38,206 --> 00:06:40,201
C'mon!

56
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,559
68 seconds.

57
00:06:49,486 --> 00:06:53,468
This is Ms Nisha's
history and geography.

58
00:06:53,558 --> 00:06:58,605
Past and present. I don't
know what's in her future.

59
00:06:58,695 --> 00:07:03,985
Her future lies in marrying me
and be a part of my family.

60
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:08,210
Wow! My family couldn't get
a better daughter-in-law.

61
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:10,642
And they won't get her.

62
00:07:11,528 --> 00:07:17,188
She absolutely hates
rich people! Hate!

63
00:07:17,278 --> 00:07:19,362
And there's another problem.

64
00:07:19,861 --> 00:07:22,987
You tell me all the problems.

65
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,159
How to solve them is my problem.

66
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:31,568
Whatever the situation,
I'll make her mine.

67
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:34,611
Mrs. Ravi Khanna.

68
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:38,670
It sounds musical!
- It's no use!

69
00:07:39,778 --> 00:07:42,319
Nisha hates the name Ravi Khanna.

70
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:47,307
Ravi Khanna. I'm sick of that name!

71
00:07:48,462 --> 00:07:51,903
Gentlemen, the sole
purpose of this meeting

72
00:07:52,787 --> 00:07:57,672
is to find out how Ravi Khanna...

73
00:07:57,762 --> 00:08:00,728
gets all our company contracts!

74
00:08:01,653 --> 00:08:04,868
United Steel Tool's
insulation 1.3 millions.

75
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:08,406
Bharat Rice Mills new
plant 1.7 millions.

76
00:08:08,807 --> 00:08:11,209
Hotel textile's polyester
plant 800,000!

77
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,326
What was Khanna Industries
10 years ago?

78
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,621
Nothing!

79
00:08:18,812 --> 00:08:22,692
And today this group
is competing with us.

80
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:28,450
Madam, with your permission,
I'd like to say something.

81
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,978
Sure go ahead.

82
00:08:31,068 --> 00:08:33,353
You're aware of our contract
with Verma Industries.

83
00:08:34,111 --> 00:08:36,229
Khanna industries are
interfering here too.

84
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:38,563
They want to snatch away this too!

85
00:08:38,653 --> 00:08:41,193
I want to discuss
the details with you.

86
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:51,745
27th at 9 at Nariman point office.
- Hence madam,

87
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:54,836
Khanna industries is
always one up on us.

88
00:08:55,528 --> 00:08:59,119
You don't have to wait for long
to make an important decision.

89
00:08:59,444 --> 00:09:01,306
You make the decision yourself.

90
00:09:01,787 --> 00:09:06,300
Hence you work too much
with little time to spare.

91
00:09:07,273 --> 00:09:10,540
Mr. Sinha, you're the first one
to say something sensible.

92
00:09:13,444 --> 00:09:15,984
I'll wait for you today
at 3.00 at our Worli office.

93
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:18,954
The decision will be made today.

94
00:09:27,102 --> 00:09:29,141
Inform the board,
the strike has been resolved

95
00:09:29,231 --> 00:09:31,271
and workers will
start work tomorrow.

96
00:09:31,786 --> 00:09:35,136
Another good-news. There's going to
be a cyclone in Mumbai on the 27th!

97
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,944
Cyclone?
- Mr. Cyclone!

98
00:09:38,034 --> 00:09:40,350
Uncle is coming?
- Yes!

99
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,850
We'll have a lot of fun.
- Yes!

100
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,544
Does he have some work?

101
00:09:43,634 --> 00:09:45,512
When I asked he replied?
- What?

102
00:09:45,602 --> 00:09:49,641
I'm not coming on work,
but not without work either.

103
00:09:49,731 --> 00:09:52,766
There isn't any right now hence
am coming for some work.

104
00:09:52,856 --> 00:09:55,131
Did you understand anything?
- How typical!

105
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:58,658
Don't forget to order
the Glen Forbes whisky. - Ok!

106
00:09:58,841 --> 00:10:02,484
Aruna it's only 6.30,
give me the Apollo Tyre's file.

107
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,599
I think you've forgotten.

108
00:10:07,338 --> 00:10:10,133
What?! - Dinner appointment
with Bharat Sinha.

109
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:14,101
Waiter!

110
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:18,996
Did you put ice in champagne?

111
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:20,781
Yes sir.
- Good!

112
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:24,406
Waiter, come here. I meant
did you put the champagne in ice?

113
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:26,021
Sorry sir.
- Good!

114
00:10:28,286 --> 00:10:29,594
Steward!
- Yes sir.

115
00:10:31,685 --> 00:10:36,073
Is the chef okay? - Yes
but why do you look nervous?

116
00:10:36,163 --> 00:10:37,465
Me and nervous?!

117
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,489
I'm having an attack, and
you ask why am I nervous?

118
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:44,294
My guest for tonight
is Ms. Nisha Singh!

119
00:10:45,915 --> 00:10:50,747
Why are you so nervous?
- What if you don't like Bharat?

120
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,030
Then you won't marry him,
that's all!

121
00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:00,471
Nisha, Aruna wanted
us to meet since long.

122
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,615
But you know how it is.

123
00:11:03,304 --> 00:11:06,094
There are only 24 hours in a day
and lots of things to do.

124
00:11:06,573 --> 00:11:12,370
Last week I was with
Swaraj Paul in London.

125
00:11:14,034 --> 00:11:17,632
You've been abroad, right? Ok!

126
00:11:17,828 --> 00:11:18,717
Please.

127
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:21,443
Come.

128
00:11:24,057 --> 00:11:24,906
This way.

129
00:11:27,423 --> 00:11:28,579
Madam, sir.

130
00:11:29,682 --> 00:11:32,553
You know all the business you got..

131
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,768
Nisha, Mr. Bharat Sinha.

132
00:12:34,746 --> 00:12:35,951
Champagne!

133
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:39,280
Somebody made me drink
this a few days ago

134
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,837
and tried to have a relation.

135
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:43,808
Are you trying to do the same?

136
00:12:43,898 --> 00:12:45,212
With you?!

137
00:12:45,302 --> 00:12:49,760
No, I'm not that kind of a boy.
I mean man.

138
00:12:50,298 --> 00:12:53,511
Don't you want to
marry Aruna? - What?!

139
00:12:53,893 --> 00:12:57,062
What did you say?
- Exactly what you heard.

140
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:01,613
You're saying I don't
want to marry Aruna?

141
00:13:01,703 --> 00:13:04,450
I don't want anything
except marry her.

142
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:09,122
Actually we both, you must
be joking. - No I'm not.

143
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:13,386
Didn't you say you didn't
want to be related with me?

144
00:13:13,476 --> 00:13:16,525
Yes or no?
- Yes but..

145
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:21,627
But the person who marries Aruna
will be my relative automatically.

146
00:13:23,556 --> 00:13:25,898
Anyway discuss dowry.

147
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,746
What can you give?

148
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:32,727
Dowry? Me?!

149
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:36,962
Aruna, at least let me have fun!

150
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:41,433
Congratulations, Mr. Sinha. No,

151
00:13:41,892 --> 00:13:45,026
I won't call you Mr. Sinha.
Congratulations, Bharat.

152
00:13:45,318 --> 00:13:48,542
You're going to marry
a fantastic woman.

153
00:13:48,632 --> 00:13:49,594
Cheers!

154
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,607
Okay, Mrs. Sinha, I'm leaving.
- But dinner?

155
00:13:57,868 --> 00:13:59,704
Have the meat, the bone is leaving.

156
00:14:00,205 --> 00:14:01,748
All right, good night.
- Bye!

157
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:10,409
God! Is she Nisha or a bomb?

158
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:13,064
Didn't I tell you?
- Yes you did.

159
00:14:14,007 --> 00:14:16,829
But when this sten
gun finds out that

160
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:18,813
I'm Ravi Khanna's legal adviser,

161
00:14:18,903 --> 00:14:20,106
What will happen then?

162
00:14:20,521 --> 00:14:23,171
Who knows?
- Who knows!

163
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:30,407
God, protect my spouse. Please!

164
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:34,378
Sorry.

165
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,766
'Welcome.'

166
00:14:48,964 --> 00:14:50,478
'We welcome you.'

167
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,268
Look Aruna.
- Yes?

168
00:15:45,023 --> 00:15:48,627
If work is worship,
I'm here to worship.

169
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,913
I mean marriage!

170
00:15:51,003 --> 00:15:53,747
Marriage! What?

171
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:55,303
At this age?!
- Why?

172
00:15:55,995 --> 00:15:58,768
There's no age limit for marriage.

173
00:15:59,829 --> 00:16:03,247
Now days people get
married at 80! - What?

174
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:07,784
Is that what you both want?
- What?

175
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:09,687
What faces are you making?

176
00:16:10,108 --> 00:16:14,514
Dear, youth and beauty
aren't permanent.

177
00:16:15,152 --> 00:16:16,817
Get married soon.

178
00:16:17,312 --> 00:16:19,644
Else you and Nisha...

179
00:16:19,734 --> 00:16:23,159
will stay spinsters forever.

180
00:16:23,553 --> 00:16:26,456
You were talking about
us getting married?!

181
00:16:26,546 --> 00:16:27,697
I thought that..

182
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:30,527
If you had sense, you
would've been married now.

183
00:16:30,617 --> 00:16:33,217
Uncle, I've found a boy for myself

184
00:16:33,307 --> 00:16:36,474
But it's difficult to
find a boy for Nisha. - Why?

185
00:16:36,991 --> 00:16:40,311
Is my niece handicapped or blind?

186
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,581
She's young, beautiful and rich.

187
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:47,686
She's a princess!
- That's the problem!

188
00:16:47,776 --> 00:16:50,238
Your princess doesn't
want a prince.

189
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,036
She wants a simple, decent,

190
00:16:53,126 --> 00:16:56,618
but a poor boy who loves her a lot.

191
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:59,589
Wow, I didn't know
my niece was so clever.

192
00:16:59,826 --> 00:17:01,802
But the problem is, uncle,

193
00:17:01,892 --> 00:17:05,160
there's a world of difference
between poor boys and Nisha.

194
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,204
Aruna!

195
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:12,014
Man has reached the moon,
you cry for these worlds?

196
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:17,860
Don't worry, it's my responsibility
to bring that boy to this world.

197
00:17:20,464 --> 00:17:23,067
Poor boy! No big deal!

198
00:17:33,613 --> 00:17:37,759
'She wants a simple, decent
but a poor boy.'

199
00:17:47,657 --> 00:17:49,264
Poor!

200
00:18:06,968 --> 00:18:08,452
Poor!

201
00:18:12,714 --> 00:18:14,609
Dear, is it difficult
to find a poor boy?

202
00:18:14,699 --> 00:18:18,149
It's very easy to find one here.

203
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:20,354
I'm sorry. Did I disturb you?

204
00:18:20,444 --> 00:18:22,707
No, uncle, sit,
I'll talk to him for 2 minutes.

205
00:18:22,797 --> 00:18:25,021
Sure!
- Thanks!

206
00:18:28,022 --> 00:18:33,344
Mr. Dharma Adhikari, I can't
help you in this matter.

207
00:18:33,802 --> 00:18:35,673
At least listen to me.

208
00:18:35,763 --> 00:18:39,438
One of the men involved in the
fight is very ill-mannered.

209
00:18:39,528 --> 00:18:41,736
And I'm not defending him,

210
00:18:42,311 --> 00:18:45,180
But the other boy, is very decent.

211
00:18:45,546 --> 00:18:47,343
He didn't even raise his hand.

212
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:52,062
He was working, came to solve the
fight but got dragged into it.

213
00:18:52,152 --> 00:18:57,476
I understand all this but
who will make Nisha understand?

214
00:18:57,784 --> 00:18:59,355
Only you can.

215
00:19:00,002 --> 00:19:01,259
Believe me madam,

216
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,514
he's a very decent
and respectable boy.

217
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:05,057
And very poor.

218
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:09,585
If he loses the job,
he'll die of hunger.

219
00:19:09,675 --> 00:19:11,502
I'm sorry, Dr. Dharma Adhikari.

220
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:16,634
It's impossible to
change Nisha's mind.

221
00:19:17,427 --> 00:19:19,713
Can I say something?

222
00:19:20,256 --> 00:19:22,769
I pity that poor fellow.

223
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:26,697
Uncle, your pity won't affect her.

224
00:19:26,787 --> 00:19:29,322
Her decision is strong.

225
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:32,944
What? I'm her uncle after all!

226
00:19:33,244 --> 00:19:36,459
So doctor..
- My name is Dharma Adhikari.

227
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:38,371
Yes, I'm so sorry.

228
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:41,300
You were saying the boy
is very decent and poor.

229
00:19:41,501 --> 00:19:42,957
Yes.
- How poor is he?

230
00:19:44,531 --> 00:19:48,320
So poor that if he loses
this job, he'll die of hunger.

231
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,669
Excellent! Very good!
- Yes?

232
00:19:51,214 --> 00:19:53,715
You won't understand,
Dr. Dhoti Dhari.

233
00:19:53,805 --> 00:19:57,553
It's Dharma Adhikari.
- Yes, whatever your name is.

234
00:19:57,643 --> 00:20:01,669
The boy is very poor, right?

235
00:20:01,817 --> 00:20:05,126
Aruna, try to understand. Poor.

236
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:10,621
But you.. - No buts else you'll
remain a spinster all your life.

237
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,472
Yes Dr. Krantikari.

238
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:16,575
It's Dharma Adhikari.
- I'm sorry!

239
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,022
I'd like to meet this boy.

240
00:20:19,698 --> 00:20:21,852
Sure, he's sitting outside.

241
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:24,994
Really?! Then Dr. Bramachari,
call him in quickly!

242
00:20:25,084 --> 00:20:29,168
Excuse me, my name
is Dharma Adhikari!

243
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,445
Dharma Adhikari!...

244
00:20:30,535 --> 00:20:33,003
Now send him in.

245
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:39,078
See how this country
is full of poor?

246
00:20:39,853 --> 00:20:42,779
This is the wonder
of India's population!

247
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:47,876
The poor sing,
'We 2 and our 102'. - Uncle!

248
00:20:48,732 --> 00:20:51,252
Can I come in?
- Yes come in.

249
00:21:07,002 --> 00:21:08,948
Come son.

250
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,139
It's a pleasure to meet you!

251
00:21:12,835 --> 00:21:16,572
You may leave. This boy is my
responsibility, Dr. Rishwatkhori.

252
00:21:18,252 --> 00:21:19,412
I'll leave.

253
00:21:19,502 --> 00:21:20,681
Come sit here son.

254
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:27,048
Son, what's your name?
- Ajay Shrivastav.

255
00:21:27,138 --> 00:21:31,522
Wow! What a beautiful

256
00:21:31,612 --> 00:21:33,351
and simple name.

257
00:21:33,765 --> 00:21:35,847
Do you reside with your parents?

258
00:21:36,084 --> 00:21:38,214
My parents expired
when I was a child.

259
00:21:38,716 --> 00:21:40,861
Good. It's very fortunate!

260
00:21:41,497 --> 00:21:46,357
Had they not passed away,
how could you've proved yourself.

261
00:21:46,627 --> 00:21:52,467
Look at me, my parents are alive
hence I depend on them.

262
00:21:54,456 --> 00:21:58,876
First tell me,
what are your hobbies?

263
00:21:59,428 --> 00:22:00,296
Sir,

264
00:22:01,127 --> 00:22:02,413
I'm a poor man.

265
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:05,375
I don't have either
money or time for hobbies.

266
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:10,346
I sometimes paint to
feel better. - Very good!

267
00:22:10,918 --> 00:22:16,179
You're an artist. Like
a miniature god who create.

268
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:20,512
If you aren't god, you're blessed!

269
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:24,194
Because henceforth
you'll start a new life.

270
00:22:24,284 --> 00:22:25,396
Uncle...

271
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,592
Uncle, I think...

272
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:33,487
you should talk
to Nisha first and then...

273
00:22:34,891 --> 00:22:36,242
Son!
- Yes?

274
00:22:37,294 --> 00:22:38,407
Do one thing!

275
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:43,176
come to the bungalow
tomorrow evening at 7:30. - Yes.

276
00:22:43,521 --> 00:22:46,090
As soon as you see Nisha,
fall at her feet.

277
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,793
No, how can you touch her feet.

278
00:22:49,289 --> 00:22:52,174
Ask for forgiveness.
I'll manage the rest.

279
00:22:52,264 --> 00:22:55,356
Will I get my job back?

280
00:22:55,446 --> 00:22:58,078
You'll get lots of things
besides the job.

281
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,227
Do come.
- Yes!

282
00:23:00,835 --> 00:23:03,111
Listen son, don't be late.

283
00:23:28,057 --> 00:23:32,305
Greetings! I'm Ajay Shrivastav.
Sir had called me at 7.30.

284
00:23:32,395 --> 00:23:33,535
Come.
- Yes.

285
00:23:34,224 --> 00:23:35,765
Come son.
- Greetings!

286
00:23:37,337 --> 00:23:39,446
What did you do?!

287
00:23:40,264 --> 00:23:42,920
You were in tattered clothes
this morning!

288
00:23:43,558 --> 00:23:45,079
What's this?!

289
00:23:45,723 --> 00:23:48,271
Sir, this is a tie.
- Tie?! This isn't a tie.

290
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:51,943
It's a noose to my
desires and your future.

291
00:23:52,421 --> 00:23:55,476
Who told you to wear
these disgusting clean clothes?

292
00:23:55,566 --> 00:23:59,690
I was coming to a big house, hence
borrowed my friend's attire.

293
00:23:59,973 --> 00:24:02,970
Am I right sir?
- No way! Remove the tie!

294
00:24:04,354 --> 00:24:05,409
Tie!

295
00:24:07,074 --> 00:24:08,487
Who is it uncle?

296
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,603
Come.

297
00:24:21,914 --> 00:24:23,269
Come son.

298
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:28,204
Dear, this is poor Shrivastav,
I mean Ajay Shrivastav.

299
00:24:28,294 --> 00:24:33,425
Ajay came to ask you something. But
without asking you, I agreed to it.

300
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:37,160
Now this old uncle's
dignity is in your hands.

301
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,690
Is there any
difference in you and me?

302
00:24:41,141 --> 00:24:44,305
But who is Mr. Ajay Shrivastav?

303
00:24:45,015 --> 00:24:45,905
Madam,

304
00:24:46,525 --> 00:24:49,903
I'm one of the 2 workers you fired.

305
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:56,113
I see! - I investigated and
found that he wasn't to blame.

306
00:24:56,687 --> 00:24:59,656
Because of that scoundrel
he was crushed too. - What?!

307
00:25:00,431 --> 00:25:01,937
This must be his pet name!

308
00:25:02,748 --> 00:25:06,391
No my nickname is Ajju.
- Ajju!

309
00:25:07,103 --> 00:25:08,271
Ajju!

310
00:25:08,896 --> 00:25:12,309
I've promised Ajju that you
would give him his job back.

311
00:25:13,057 --> 00:25:16,870
Because I know that you can never
disappoint a poor man.

312
00:25:17,556 --> 00:25:21,132
Don't go by his clothes they belong
to someone else. Right Ajju?

313
00:25:21,694 --> 00:25:24,120
Madam, honestly,

314
00:25:24,807 --> 00:25:26,252
I didn't fight with anyone.

315
00:25:28,017 --> 00:25:29,294
Okay.

316
00:25:29,384 --> 00:25:31,984
I'll give you another
chance because uncle said so.

317
00:25:32,973 --> 00:25:37,134
But remember one thing.
- There's no need for buts!

318
00:25:37,224 --> 00:25:42,087
Listen to his attributes.
He's a very good artist.

319
00:25:42,402 --> 00:25:45,628
If he paints your
portrait, you'd be stunned,

320
00:25:45,718 --> 00:25:48,974
and wonder what am I doing
hanging on the wall? - Really?

321
00:25:50,846 --> 00:25:55,097
He's a man with good qualities.
He has no parents.

322
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,317
I..
- We cannot talk like this.

323
00:25:58,604 --> 00:26:00,591
Come over for dinner
someday. What say Nisha?

324
00:26:00,681 --> 00:26:02,341
What?! Dinner?

325
00:26:02,431 --> 00:26:03,737
It'll be fun!

326
00:26:04,265 --> 00:26:08,170
Honey, talk to Ajay.
He's a very interesting boy.

327
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,508
When will you come?

328
00:26:09,807 --> 00:26:12,777
Whenever you say.
I have enough time.

329
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,886
Day after tomorrow. Wednesday.

330
00:26:15,554 --> 00:26:16,872
An auspicious day.

331
00:26:17,482 --> 00:26:20,014
What would you like for dinner?

332
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:23,636
We poor people can't afford taste.

333
00:26:24,224 --> 00:26:26,967
We eat whatever is cheapest.

334
00:26:27,057 --> 00:26:30,364
An interesting thought!

335
00:26:31,015 --> 00:26:35,727
Poor, should be like him. What
did your mother cook for you?

336
00:26:35,981 --> 00:26:39,642
My niece will
cook and feed you too!

337
00:26:39,876 --> 00:26:43,092
You mean me, uncle!

338
00:26:43,182 --> 00:26:44,134
Whatever.

339
00:26:44,224 --> 00:26:47,058
I'll be happy
to eat what you offer.

340
00:26:47,643 --> 00:26:51,563
I must leave,
I have wasted your time.

341
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:52,711
Go son.

342
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:59,992
Ajju, work from tomorrow
and food the day after.

343
00:27:02,265 --> 00:27:04,763
Madam, thank you very much!

344
00:27:06,073 --> 00:27:09,785
Sir, you'll have my
families good wishes!

345
00:27:15,262 --> 00:27:17,092
Wife and children?

346
00:27:17,182 --> 00:27:19,749
Yes sir, hence I was very worried!

347
00:27:20,343 --> 00:27:23,879
I have 3 daughters
Asha, Usha and Lata.

348
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:29,476
Uncle, since you asked,

349
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,721
my mother cooked delicious
flatbread with brinjal.

350
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,157
Cheat!

351
00:27:40,182 --> 00:27:41,546
Scoundrel!

352
00:27:43,224 --> 00:27:44,338
Monkey!

353
00:27:45,306 --> 00:27:47,092
Devil!
- Uncle!

354
00:28:11,305 --> 00:28:12,596
Good morning!

355
00:28:13,336 --> 00:28:17,100
Aruna, what's the time?
My watches aren't working.

356
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:20,299
Today time has stopped.
- As in?

357
00:28:20,389 --> 00:28:24,369
Nisha, if you keep working
like this, I'll fall ill.

358
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,140
Your life has no day or night,
no Sunday or Monday.

359
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,098
Your whole life is
trapped in these watches.

360
00:28:32,346 --> 00:28:35,004
All watches have
stopped so you're let free.

361
00:28:35,094 --> 00:28:39,327
No office, factory, appointments,
no.. - A complete day off?!

362
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,024
Yes completely!

363
00:28:43,273 --> 00:28:45,473
Then I will sleep!

364
00:28:47,069 --> 00:28:47,983
Good night!

365
00:29:14,568 --> 00:29:20,812
"My beauty and my colour,
and every part of my body."

366
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:26,840
"My beauty and my colour,
and every part of my body."

367
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:32,785
"All say they miss someone."

368
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:37,298
"All say they miss someone."

369
00:29:37,388 --> 00:29:42,804
"My beauty and my colour,
and every part of my body."

370
00:29:42,894 --> 00:29:48,535
"All say they miss someone."

371
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:53,004
"All say they miss someone."

372
00:29:53,094 --> 00:29:59,028
"My beauty and my colour,
and every part of my body."

373
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:36,222
"An unseen stranger,
wonder who is he"

374
00:30:36,312 --> 00:30:41,186
"Yet he is familiar.
Wonder who is he."

375
00:30:42,972 --> 00:30:48,094
"The man crazy about me,
wonder who is he"

376
00:30:49,177 --> 00:30:54,874
"The man crazy about me,
wonder who is he"

377
00:30:55,599 --> 00:31:00,829
"Climate, dust and every flower."

378
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:06,722
"All tell me they miss someone."

379
00:31:06,812 --> 00:31:11,170
"All say they miss someone."

380
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:16,927
"My beauty and my colour,
and every part of my body."

381
00:31:45,156 --> 00:31:51,117
"Perhaps he has forgotten the way."

382
00:31:51,505 --> 00:31:56,676
"He's a stranger,
what does he know?"

383
00:31:57,773 --> 00:32:03,892
"Wind, go and tell him."

384
00:32:03,982 --> 00:32:10,764
"Wind, go and tell him."

385
00:32:10,854 --> 00:32:21,877
"My heart and its every desire
says it misses someone"

386
00:32:21,967 --> 00:32:26,008
"All say they miss someone."

387
00:32:26,327 --> 00:32:28,648
"My beauty and my colour"

388
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:35,720
"Every part of my body."

389
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,672
Hello. Yes.

390
00:32:48,303 --> 00:32:50,046
Sir, a call for you.

391
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,324
Hello.
- Hello uncle, this is Aruna.

392
00:32:56,719 --> 00:33:01,259
I'll be late. If Bharat arrives,
could you please make him seated.

393
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:04,330
Would I make your fiance stand?

394
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:06,499
You think I'm an idiot.

395
00:33:06,589 --> 00:33:10,153
No uncle, I thought
you may have forgotten.

396
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:13,252
This is my first
meet with your fiance,

397
00:33:13,812 --> 00:33:16,233
How can I forget
this important occasion?

398
00:33:16,323 --> 00:33:19,839
I've been waiting since half
an hour... I guess, he's come.

399
00:33:22,725 --> 00:33:26,122
My name is Bhosle. Yashwant
Bhosle. Video mechanic.

400
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:28,210
Please come.

401
00:33:30,631 --> 00:33:31,761
Come.

402
00:33:33,309 --> 00:33:36,186
Come son, I've been
waiting for you.

403
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,517
I am Nisha's uncle.

404
00:33:38,607 --> 00:33:40,505
Forgive me I was
late because of the bus.

405
00:33:40,595 --> 00:33:45,464
Bus, don't you
have a car? - Car? No.

406
00:33:46,783 --> 00:33:49,628
Very good!
You should be like that.

407
00:33:49,718 --> 00:33:53,391
Why need a car when you have legs!

408
00:33:55,687 --> 00:33:58,777
Sir, where is it?
- Sir?

409
00:34:00,729 --> 00:34:02,342
Nowadays it isn't sir, son.

410
00:34:03,762 --> 00:34:06,825
Nowadays It is Padhamshree
Padhamabhusan etc.

411
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,385
I wasn't 'Sir' even before 1947.

412
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:12,122
I was only legs.

413
00:34:14,105 --> 00:34:17,825
Son-in-law, your
favourite Glen Fobs.

414
00:34:18,277 --> 00:34:21,404
No soda, no water only ice.

415
00:34:21,962 --> 00:34:23,700
My name isn't son-in-law.

416
00:34:24,447 --> 00:34:26,355
If it isn't, it will be. Drink!

417
00:34:27,738 --> 00:34:29,668
Will I get intoxicated by this?

418
00:34:29,998 --> 00:34:32,606
No son. When is alcohol
ever intoxicating?

419
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:34,038
Drink!

420
00:34:42,891 --> 00:34:44,027
Sit.

421
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:47,126
How is work going?

422
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:51,648
Better now, last year it was bad.

423
00:34:52,003 --> 00:34:55,976
That had to happen, since you
didn't know Aruna then.

424
00:34:56,439 --> 00:34:57,560
I didn't understand.

425
00:34:57,893 --> 00:34:59,752
What is Aruna got
to do with my job?

426
00:35:00,968 --> 00:35:04,738
Her blessing have made you
promote. My Aruna is a goddess.

427
00:35:04,828 --> 00:35:08,212
Goddess! Like goddess Shantoshi?

428
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,788
Funny!

429
00:35:10,878 --> 00:35:13,246
Lawyer, after marriage,

430
00:35:13,336 --> 00:35:16,219
you'll know it's easier to
please a goddess than a wife.

431
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:18,704
Lawyer? Wedding?!

432
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:23,467
Sir, I'll go out for a while.
- Why?

433
00:35:24,138 --> 00:35:25,943
Can't you sit and talk to me?

434
00:35:26,962 --> 00:35:30,997
You have no peace without Aruna?

435
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,776
What are you saying, sir?

436
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:37,562
I'm joking! I can joke too!

437
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:47,117
Anyway, have you decided the rest?

438
00:35:47,352 --> 00:35:50,745
What? I've a fixed rate.
- Fixed rate?

439
00:35:50,835 --> 00:35:54,413
It's my business. In business..
- You've come for business?

440
00:35:54,503 --> 00:35:56,672
You think I'm here to drink?

441
00:35:57,931 --> 00:36:00,782
The marriage with Aruna?
- Can't happen!

442
00:36:00,872 --> 00:36:03,452
I'm only... My only
interest is video and TV.

443
00:36:03,768 --> 00:36:05,251
Video and TV?
- Yes.

444
00:36:05,341 --> 00:36:06,620
You scoundrel!

445
00:36:07,033 --> 00:36:09,742
No wonder you weren't happy
to see me.

446
00:36:09,832 --> 00:36:12,651
You knew I'd see through you.

447
00:36:12,741 --> 00:36:14,434
Good evening!
- A very bad evening.

448
00:36:14,524 --> 00:36:20,143
It's your business to trap rich
girls but Aruna isn't so stupid!

449
00:36:20,562 --> 00:36:24,597
When she gets here, we'll talk
about TV, video and fixed rate.

450
00:36:24,687 --> 00:36:27,786
Excuse me,
how are you related to Aruna?

451
00:36:28,042 --> 00:36:31,916
See even a stranger has
so much respect for Aruna.

452
00:36:32,006 --> 00:36:35,008
When I don't know Aruna,
why should I respect her?

453
00:36:35,098 --> 00:36:36,759
The lawyer is changing the topic.

454
00:36:36,849 --> 00:36:39,344
You're a lawyer too?
- Not just that

455
00:36:39,434 --> 00:36:41,689
but also son-in-law
according to him.

456
00:36:41,951 --> 00:36:45,324
Son-in-law? Then who am I?
- Good question, who are you?

457
00:36:45,414 --> 00:36:49,231
I am Bharat Sinha, Aruna's..
- Yes Aruna's..

458
00:36:49,321 --> 00:36:52,885
But then who are you?
- He's a fool!

459
00:36:52,975 --> 00:36:56,246
What?
- I am a TV mechanic.

460
00:36:56,628 --> 00:36:59,780
Why didn't you tell me?
- Did you ever give a chance?

461
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:02,652
TV and video are upstairs,
go check them.

462
00:37:03,757 --> 00:37:06,295
He sat with me to drink.
It's expensive!

463
00:37:08,788 --> 00:37:11,564
God, save this poor.
- Poor!

464
00:37:11,922 --> 00:37:14,463
Listen son!
- God, help me!

465
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:20,177
Are you poor?
- What do you think?

466
00:37:20,501 --> 00:37:22,297
You seem very poor.
- Yes!

467
00:37:23,818 --> 00:37:25,850
Are you married?
- No.

468
00:37:27,623 --> 00:37:33,116
Do you've daughters named
Lata Asha and Usha? - No.

469
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:39,753
Do you like flatbread stuffed
with radish and brinjal?

470
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:42,378
What!
- No.

471
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,874
Hearing about it
gives me indigestion.

472
00:37:44,964 --> 00:37:47,770
Very good! Go do your work.

473
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:51,160
Remember god and
me are with you.

474
00:37:52,594 --> 00:37:53,912
God!

475
00:37:59,741 --> 00:38:02,297
Lawyer, do you like this boy?

476
00:38:02,601 --> 00:38:04,242
He's a drunkard.
- What?

477
00:38:04,332 --> 00:38:08,006
I mean he drinks. - I know that,
I only made him have it.

478
00:38:08,752 --> 00:38:09,900
Poor!

479
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:13,057
How will he be for the marriage?

480
00:38:13,147 --> 00:38:14,756
Marriage! With whom?

481
00:38:14,846 --> 00:38:16,456
Nisha.
- What!

482
00:38:16,546 --> 00:38:20,045
Good evening, uncle! Bharat.
- Good evening!

483
00:38:20,397 --> 00:38:24,439
Didn't Aruna come? - Aren't you
at peace without Aruna?

484
00:38:24,977 --> 00:38:27,134
To tell the truth, I'm not.

485
00:38:27,224 --> 00:38:29,026
She must be on her way.

486
00:38:29,116 --> 00:38:32,178
What is it dear, you look tired.

487
00:38:32,762 --> 00:38:34,931
There was a lot of work today.

488
00:38:35,935 --> 00:38:40,383
Exhaustion is all over your face.
Go upstairs and freshen up?

489
00:38:41,049 --> 00:38:43,864
Let me talk to Bharat for a while.

490
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:45,712
Bharat isn't running away.

491
00:38:45,802 --> 00:38:49,927
You've come straight from work.
Go upstairs and freshen up.

492
00:38:50,438 --> 00:38:53,424
Okay. Bharat, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

493
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:02,114
Do you really want Nisha...

494
00:39:02,204 --> 00:39:03,756
to marry that drunkard?

495
00:39:03,846 --> 00:39:07,934
Wait and watch what happens next!

496
00:39:15,655 --> 00:39:24,524
"When you're sleeping.."

497
00:39:24,973 --> 00:39:30,245
"When you come too close to me,
look what happens to me."

498
00:39:31,338 --> 00:39:38,458
"How do I tell you
what you do to me?"

499
00:39:39,133 --> 00:39:41,784
""How do I tell you..."

500
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,039
Don't move!

501
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:48,967
Now come out slowly.

502
00:39:52,949 --> 00:39:54,025
Out.

503
00:40:00,587 --> 00:40:01,978
Hands up.

504
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:05,376
Who are you and how
did you come here?

505
00:40:06,273 --> 00:40:09,475
My name is Yashwant Rao Bhosle.

506
00:40:09,565 --> 00:40:11,484
Mukampost, Gambhul pada,

507
00:40:11,574 --> 00:40:13,546
Taluka Sudhgadh, district Alibag.

508
00:40:13,636 --> 00:40:15,269
My father and grandfather
for the past 3 generations..

509
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,714
I don't want to listen
to your life history. - Yes.

510
00:40:18,605 --> 00:40:21,950
How did you get in here?
- By the stairs madam.

511
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,431
What were you doing hiding here?

512
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:27,106
I was repairing the video.
- You were repairing the video?!

513
00:40:27,196 --> 00:40:29,393
Yes I'm a video mechanic, madam.

514
00:40:30,057 --> 00:40:35,303
Why didn't you tell me before?
- You didn't give me the chance to.

515
00:40:35,393 --> 00:40:38,856
I'm extremely sorry,
put your hands down.

516
00:40:38,946 --> 00:40:42,662
Put your pistol down.
- I'm sorry!

517
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,350
Don't get me wrong.

518
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:46,115
Why shouldn't I?

519
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,768
That old man down gave me rum
and got me drunk.

520
00:40:48,858 --> 00:40:51,233
You're waving a gun
and making me sweat.

521
00:40:51,524 --> 00:40:52,367
Old man!

522
00:40:52,457 --> 00:40:56,816
He may look young to you,
but he's old! And crazy too!

523
00:40:57,233 --> 00:41:01,340
As I stepped in, he called me
his son-in-law, then a lawyer,

524
00:41:01,647 --> 00:41:03,526
later gave me alcohol
and got me drunk.

525
00:41:04,066 --> 00:41:07,078
He offered me drinks.
Nothing to eat.

526
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:13,566
Will that not make an empty stomach
burn? What this world will turn to?

527
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,832
You sit.

528
00:41:18,024 --> 00:41:19,649
I'll bring you something to eat.

529
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:25,696
Hail lord Ganpati!

530
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,647
Uncle...

531
00:41:28,414 --> 00:41:31,305
Uncle, you should've told me
there's someone in my room.

532
00:41:31,395 --> 00:41:33,775
Why? Did he misbehave?

533
00:41:33,865 --> 00:41:35,971
No he's a very decent man.
- Damn!

534
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:39,575
Why did you make him drink?
- That's a long story.

535
00:41:40,177 --> 00:41:42,193
I thought he was Bharat.

536
00:41:42,576 --> 00:41:43,916
What?!
- Yes,

537
00:41:44,006 --> 00:41:45,478
I offered him drinks.

538
00:41:45,568 --> 00:41:49,439
When I realized my mistake,
I forgot to tell you.

539
00:41:49,529 --> 00:41:51,266
Well what did you both talk about?

540
00:41:51,356 --> 00:41:52,639
What else?

541
00:41:52,729 --> 00:41:56,190
He was praising you.
- Yes, he must have.

542
00:41:56,789 --> 00:42:00,266
Give that to me, I'll take it.
A guest is like god.

543
00:42:00,356 --> 00:42:03,930
No, you don't I'll take it,
you sit with Bharat.

544
00:42:15,687 --> 00:42:18,149
She herself took it.
- Yes!

545
00:42:18,584 --> 00:42:20,233
Hail the god of the poor!

546
00:42:20,636 --> 00:42:25,284
Lawyer, can we call Bismilla Khan
to play the flute at the wedding?

547
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:30,365
Uncle, you've already
planned their marriage!

548
00:42:30,455 --> 00:42:34,233
I don't understand something.
He'll repair the TV and go.

549
00:42:34,471 --> 00:42:36,732
Then how will they meet again?

550
00:42:37,024 --> 00:42:38,227
Very simple.

551
00:42:38,523 --> 00:42:41,563
The things that are
repaired can spoil again.

552
00:42:42,271 --> 00:42:45,490
Don't worry that's
my responsibility.

553
00:43:12,406 --> 00:43:16,452
What will happen when a bull
enters a glass showroom.

554
00:43:18,534 --> 00:43:23,770
He will smash into the glasses
and they'll break into pieces.

555
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,772
The same will happen here too.

556
00:43:26,324 --> 00:43:31,621
As long as that old man smashes
into things with his horns.

557
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:35,169
Nothing will be safe. Never.

558
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:40,797
Is it possible that I repair
the TV and it gets spolt again?!

559
00:43:40,887 --> 00:43:44,388
Greetings, Mr. Bhosle!
- Damn! What greeting and..

560
00:43:47,229 --> 00:43:52,068
You're here.
- Yes, this is my bedroom.

561
00:43:55,082 --> 00:43:57,545
How did this stop working again?

562
00:43:58,133 --> 00:44:02,015
Don't know. Uncle said
last night, suddenly.. - Uncle?!

563
00:44:02,761 --> 00:44:05,607
You mean that crazy bald
old man is your uncle?

564
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,646
Yes.
- A pity.

565
00:44:08,736 --> 00:44:12,632
My uncle is old but not crazy.

566
00:44:13,135 --> 00:44:15,108
Why does he irritate you so much?

567
00:44:22,611 --> 00:44:23,902
Because of this.

568
00:44:24,189 --> 00:44:27,332
It's been an hour an a half!

569
00:44:27,848 --> 00:44:31,066
You tell me how things
must be proceeding between them.

570
00:44:31,494 --> 00:44:34,868
I think there must be a
serious problem with the TV.

571
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:37,094
The poor fellow must
be busy repairing it.

572
00:44:38,117 --> 00:44:40,795
Foolish girl! I'll tell you!

573
00:44:41,781 --> 00:44:45,465
They must be talking about love.

574
00:44:46,146 --> 00:44:51,679
Two souls will be meeting, two
hearts will beating as one,

575
00:44:51,769 --> 00:44:55,191
two spirits uniting!

576
00:44:55,953 --> 00:44:57,531
This TV didn't just get ruined.

577
00:44:58,672 --> 00:45:02,690
It was hit with a hammer.

578
00:45:03,069 --> 00:45:03,997
What?!

579
00:45:04,815 --> 00:45:07,454
Who would hit a TV with a hammer?

580
00:45:08,925 --> 00:45:10,984
That bald bull.

581
00:45:12,934 --> 00:45:14,171
Your uncle.

582
00:45:14,261 --> 00:45:18,688
This is too much Mr. Bhosle! It's a
machine. It can stop working!

583
00:45:18,778 --> 00:45:19,881
I'm a scientist.

584
00:45:19,971 --> 00:45:22,010
I can't bear to listen
to anything against machines.

585
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,474
You're a scientist too?

586
00:45:24,564 --> 00:45:28,259
You're asking me whether
I'm a scientist?!

587
00:45:28,349 --> 00:45:31,838
You would be shocked when
you see my inventions!

588
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:36,562
Then show me! - You'll see
one as soon as I leave.

589
00:45:36,992 --> 00:45:38,469
Ask me how?

590
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:43,298
If anyone tries to ruin
this TV or video again,

591
00:45:44,594 --> 00:45:46,871
his face will be ruined.

592
00:46:13,212 --> 00:46:15,014
Mr. Bhosle!
- Greetings.

593
00:46:15,104 --> 00:46:17,788
Have you been called again?
- No, I came just like that.

594
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:23,251
Is everyone fine at home?
- Yes.

595
00:46:23,341 --> 00:46:24,962
Why?
- I'm just asking.

596
00:46:25,542 --> 00:46:29,995
I have a small gift for you.

597
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:31,897
Gift.

598
00:46:33,576 --> 00:46:37,514
You said you wanted to
see my new invention,

599
00:46:38,669 --> 00:46:40,081
so meet him.

600
00:46:40,694 --> 00:46:42,520
This is an earthquake indicator.

601
00:46:43,114 --> 00:46:45,308
Bhosle invention number 503.

602
00:46:46,547 --> 00:46:48,934
If there's to be an
earthquake in Mumbai,

603
00:46:49,337 --> 00:46:52,749
it will ring 6.59
minutes in advance.

604
00:46:52,839 --> 00:46:55,173
It's very useful.

605
00:46:55,263 --> 00:47:00,403
We can only know that 6.59
minutes before earthquake.

606
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:05,214
It's a pity that in
our country every year,

607
00:47:05,304 --> 00:47:07,811
there are cyclones, storms,

608
00:47:07,901 --> 00:47:12,327
famines, floods
but never an earthquake.

609
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:16,053
Mr. Bhosle, I don't
know much about this but..

610
00:47:16,143 --> 00:47:18,684
It's shameful that
an educated girl like you

611
00:47:18,774 --> 00:47:20,713
doesn't know much
about electronics.

612
00:47:21,407 --> 00:47:24,350
There's a science
exhibition in Churchgate.

613
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:27,649
Go and watch what inventions
the world has made.

614
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:31,159
Yes dear, go and see
what's happening in the world.

615
00:47:31,755 --> 00:47:34,113
Bhosle will join you
and explain everything.

616
00:47:34,203 --> 00:47:35,205
Uncle!

617
00:47:35,295 --> 00:47:36,762
Bhosle.
- Yes?

618
00:47:47,134 --> 00:47:48,640
Okay.

619
00:47:53,768 --> 00:47:58,553
Bharat you're unnecessarily
worried. That can never happen.

620
00:47:58,643 --> 00:48:00,119
Why not?

621
00:48:00,764 --> 00:48:02,503
If she wants it can happen.

622
00:48:03,402 --> 00:48:07,049
Till now he came to repair TV.
Today they've gone out together!

623
00:48:07,565 --> 00:48:09,640
Things are progressing
Mr. Khanna! Do something!

624
00:48:10,007 --> 00:48:12,095
Before the golden bird
goes out of your hand.

625
00:48:12,185 --> 00:48:14,101
Don't worry lawyer.

626
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:17,550
I'm an experienced hunter.

627
00:48:18,163 --> 00:48:20,976
However high this bird flies,

628
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:23,492
it cannot escape from my aim.

629
00:48:24,847 --> 00:48:28,225
They are very decent people.
- But you're stupid!

630
00:48:28,612 --> 00:48:31,550
Problems keep coming with their
video, and they keep calling you.

631
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,788
And today Nisha
herself dropped you home.

632
00:48:33,878 --> 00:48:36,548
You've also been invited for
dinner! Don't you get it?!

633
00:48:38,296 --> 00:48:39,718
What's there to understand?

634
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:44,625
Your Nisha wants to become
my sister-in-law.

635
00:49:25,816 --> 00:49:26,927
Sir you?!

636
00:49:27,642 --> 00:49:29,736
I want to meet your brother.

637
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,064
I'll call him, please have a seat.

638
00:49:33,879 --> 00:49:35,823
Sir, I apologize.

639
00:49:36,526 --> 00:49:39,766
I shouldn't have asked Usha
to type my letter at work.

640
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,317
It's my fault, not hers.

641
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:42,874
You..

642
00:49:43,278 --> 00:49:46,024
Punish me however you want,

643
00:49:46,364 --> 00:49:48,958
but please don't fire her.

644
00:49:49,744 --> 00:49:52,323
Bhosle, you're talking
about punishment.

645
00:49:52,708 --> 00:49:54,833
I'm here to reward you.

646
00:49:55,334 --> 00:49:56,726
Reward?!
- Yes!

647
00:49:57,153 --> 00:49:58,544
You're a genius!

648
00:49:58,634 --> 00:50:02,954
I guess you're unaware how useful
your inventions could be.

649
00:50:03,592 --> 00:50:06,592
My inventions and useful?
- Yes.

650
00:50:07,235 --> 00:50:09,219
This is a small gift.

651
00:50:13,101 --> 00:50:14,752
There's only a million here.

652
00:50:16,427 --> 00:50:20,580
Mr. Bhosle, you're a scientist
and I'm a businessman.

653
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:22,454
If we work together,

654
00:50:22,929 --> 00:50:28,607
I can assure you that you'll
become a millionaire soon.

655
00:50:28,697 --> 00:50:29,809
Did you understand.

656
00:50:29,929 --> 00:50:31,261
Millionaire!

657
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,443
You mean..

658
00:50:38,409 --> 00:50:41,363
You mean millionaire that comprises
of many hundred thousands?

659
00:50:41,453 --> 00:50:44,738
Yes, the same ones that
comprises of a few thousands.

660
00:50:45,139 --> 00:50:46,838
I'm sure you know
what a thousand is.

661
00:50:57,347 --> 00:50:59,350
Hail Lord Ganpati!

662
00:51:01,589 --> 00:51:04,359
Om is the truth!

663
00:51:05,165 --> 00:51:09,170
Om is the truth!

664
00:51:10,972 --> 00:51:16,043
Hail the god of
the poor, you're great!

665
00:51:17,026 --> 00:51:19,471
Uncle!
- I'm here, dear.

666
00:51:21,346 --> 00:51:23,885
What is it?
You seem very happy today!

667
00:51:23,975 --> 00:51:25,677
Any good news for me?
- Yes!

668
00:51:27,048 --> 00:51:32,292
Look! Mr. Bhosle's invention
has stunned the world.

669
00:51:32,745 --> 00:51:35,464
Wow, this is a terrific news!

670
00:51:35,554 --> 00:51:38,273
You agree to it.
I'll amaze you more!

671
00:51:38,363 --> 00:51:41,939
Uncle.
- Yes dear, say.

672
00:51:42,029 --> 00:51:45,723
Uncle, Yashwant Rao Bhosle
is now a millionaire.

673
00:51:45,813 --> 00:51:48,568
I knew he's a lucky husband.

674
00:51:48,658 --> 00:51:51,559
Uncle, a millionaire!

675
00:51:51,649 --> 00:51:54,343
Hence.. What?!
- Yes.

676
00:51:56,652 --> 00:51:59,975
Yes, Mr. Bhosle is a millionaire!

677
00:52:00,216 --> 00:52:02,178
In a few days he'll
beome a billionaire.

678
00:52:02,759 --> 00:52:04,760
Billionaire! This means...

679
00:52:05,441 --> 00:52:06,277
Means...

680
00:52:06,367 --> 00:52:10,743
This means, now Mr. Bhosle
won't come here to repair the TV.

681
00:52:11,894 --> 00:52:14,539
There's still time for
things to work out, uncle.

682
00:52:17,811 --> 00:52:22,823
No! Scoundrel! Idiot!

683
00:52:23,689 --> 00:52:26,497
Moron!

684
00:52:49,509 --> 00:52:51,968
Laugh your heart out!

685
00:52:52,397 --> 00:52:55,836
Now the video mechanic is a
millionaire, there's no danger.

686
00:52:55,926 --> 00:52:59,506
Mr. Khanna, I felt as though

687
00:52:59,596 --> 00:53:03,273
you've lost the game for
the first time in life.

688
00:53:04,478 --> 00:53:09,488
The game has just begun.
My life has no place for defeat.

689
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:11,891
What I don't understand is,

690
00:53:13,096 --> 00:53:18,025
I told you Nisha hates the wealthy.

691
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:21,360
And you're aware, she can't
stand the name Ravi Khanna.

692
00:53:21,764 --> 00:53:24,516
Despite this how are you so sure?

693
00:53:27,191 --> 00:53:28,156
Bharat,

694
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:29,909
Life's a game

695
00:53:29,999 --> 00:53:33,986
that must be either played with
confidence or not played at all.

696
00:53:36,278 --> 00:53:40,011
Life has only taught me to win.

697
00:53:40,942 --> 00:53:46,226
Khanna hates unsuccessful as much
as, Nisha hates the Khanna name.

698
00:53:47,499 --> 00:53:52,620
Now that she's in Hyderabad,
we can sleep in peace for 3-4 days.

699
00:53:55,178 --> 00:53:58,655
Why, isn't poverty there?

700
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:10,367
Aruna, what kind
of place is this?

701
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:13,209
I haven't seen any
poor since half an hour!

702
00:54:13,299 --> 00:54:15,271
What's the use of democracy?

703
00:54:15,361 --> 00:54:20,228
Please uncle! We've failed twice!
I can't endure another.

704
00:54:20,835 --> 00:54:25,798
For god's sake,
stop this for a few days.

705
00:54:26,112 --> 00:54:26,927
Good morning sir!
- Good morning!

706
00:54:27,017 --> 00:54:28,438
Good morning, ma'am.
- Thank you.

707
00:54:29,703 --> 00:54:31,250
Listen.
- Yes sir?

708
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:36,392
Do you work here?
- Yes, any problems here sir?

709
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:41,796
How can we have problems with
people like you working here?

710
00:54:41,886 --> 00:54:43,880
Am at your service sir.

711
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:46,502
Yes I won't call anyone except you.

712
00:54:46,592 --> 00:54:49,704
Thank you! Father told me
to take good care of you.

713
00:54:50,554 --> 00:54:53,005
Whose dad? - This hotel
belongs to my dad.

714
00:54:53,095 --> 00:54:56,645
I'm Vicky Menon. undergoing
training. - Vicky!

715
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:02,220
Good morning uncle!
- Good morning.

716
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:03,833
Good morning Aruna!
- Good morning!

717
00:55:03,923 --> 00:55:07,683
Sorry I made you wait. Shall we?
- Come. Let's go.

718
00:55:07,773 --> 00:55:09,171
Nisha is here.

719
00:55:10,431 --> 00:55:12,262
Good morning ma'am.
- Good morning.

720
00:55:12,352 --> 00:55:14,300
Come. This is your guide.

721
00:55:19,663 --> 00:55:22,908
Greetings. This poor man is
known as Viju Guide.

722
00:55:22,998 --> 00:55:27,831
Wow! Destiny! Jackpot!

723
00:55:28,952 --> 00:55:31,050
'Atmosphere is filling
the garden with colour.

724
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:33,516
So the flower
business can flourish.'

725
00:55:53,924 --> 00:55:58,990
This building was constructed
200 years ago in1803. - Great!

726
00:56:01,195 --> 00:56:03,512
Col. Achilles Patrick designed it.

727
00:56:03,931 --> 00:56:06,637
Later King Shahan Shah
Azam bestowed upon him

728
00:56:06,727 --> 00:56:08,172
the title of Navab Hassan Bahadhur.

729
00:56:08,262 --> 00:56:11,167
Great!
- Very nice!

730
00:56:11,257 --> 00:56:14,922
This mansion with an
area of 80 acres has 240 rooms.

731
00:56:15,012 --> 00:56:19,721
It's a very important historical
structure in southern India.

732
00:56:19,811 --> 00:56:20,931
Hang on son.

733
00:56:21,293 --> 00:56:25,909
Dear, won't you click a snap
of this beautiful structure?

734
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:29,863
Yes uncle.
- Yes, take it.

735
00:56:34,409 --> 00:56:36,723
Nisha, you're taking a snap?

736
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:40,095
Yes?

737
00:56:40,402 --> 00:56:43,125
Amazing son!
You have great potential!

738
00:56:43,215 --> 00:56:45,334
I've never met anyone
as knowledgeable as you.

739
00:56:45,424 --> 00:56:47,762
How do you remember so much?

740
00:56:47,852 --> 00:56:50,125
Sir, this is my business.

741
00:56:50,215 --> 00:56:53,220
If I don't show my
potential, who will pay me?

742
00:56:53,425 --> 00:56:58,304
Yes, correct! And without money
how will your family survive?

743
00:56:58,394 --> 00:56:59,316
Sir!

744
00:56:59,762 --> 00:57:03,316
My parents expired when I was
child. - I knew it when I saw you.

745
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:06,392
If not parents then
what about wife or kids?

746
00:57:09,153 --> 00:57:13,762
I only have one whom
I can call my own.

747
00:57:14,214 --> 00:57:16,066
Who is that?
- Me, myself.

748
00:57:17,178 --> 00:57:18,631
Now we are all set.

749
00:57:18,721 --> 00:57:21,007
Listen son, here's
some priceless advice.

750
00:57:21,715 --> 00:57:24,512
Never invent anything.

751
00:57:25,658 --> 00:57:26,906
Invent?

752
00:57:28,381 --> 00:57:31,613
I don't understand. - You don't
need to. I'll invent something.

753
00:57:31,703 --> 00:57:32,851
Nisha!

754
00:57:40,276 --> 00:57:41,178
Come.

755
00:57:41,614 --> 00:57:43,780
Uncle, give this to Vijay.

756
00:57:44,679 --> 00:57:46,631
What is it dear, a letter?

757
00:57:46,721 --> 00:57:49,886
Why would I write to him?
It's his fees. - All right.

758
00:57:50,886 --> 00:57:52,297
Mumbai isn't so hot?

759
00:57:52,387 --> 00:57:55,321
Thank you very much Vijay.
We'll meet tomorrow.

760
00:57:55,411 --> 00:57:57,095
Come Aruna.
- Greetings.

761
00:57:59,784 --> 00:58:04,058
Okay, greetings!
- When will you come tomorrow?

762
00:58:04,148 --> 00:58:05,963
Whenever you say.

763
00:58:06,053 --> 00:58:08,124
At 9.30.
- As you say, sir.

764
00:58:08,214 --> 00:58:10,262
I'll wait for you all at the lobby.

765
00:58:10,895 --> 00:58:14,374
Why, lobby?
How dare you say that?!

766
00:58:14,813 --> 00:58:18,725
Are you a stranger? No!
You come to the room directly.

767
00:58:18,815 --> 00:58:21,645
Room 116. And take this dowry.

768
00:58:22,371 --> 00:58:25,536
Dowry?
- I mean your fees.

769
00:58:27,886 --> 00:58:29,356
Pardon my mistakes.

770
00:58:30,053 --> 00:58:31,840
I don't understand what you mean.

771
00:58:32,802 --> 00:58:34,987
That will take some time son.

772
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:38,672
That TV mechanic
couldn't understand me.

773
00:58:38,762 --> 00:58:40,838
Anyway we can chat tomorrow.

774
00:58:40,928 --> 00:58:44,086
You come upstairs directly.
Room number 116.

775
00:58:45,928 --> 00:58:52,505
"The promises of seasons.
The climate says"

776
00:58:53,885 --> 00:58:56,589
Greetings. Am I late?
- No!

777
00:58:56,679 --> 00:58:58,922
Today we might not be comming.

778
00:58:59,012 --> 00:59:02,163
Why? - Uncle is unwell
since last night.

779
00:59:03,044 --> 00:59:04,880
Speak!

780
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:06,712
Who is it, Nisha?

781
00:59:06,802 --> 00:59:09,628
Come in.
- It's Viju Guide.

782
00:59:09,718 --> 00:59:10,950
Uncle!

783
00:59:12,595 --> 00:59:14,465
He's unwell?

784
00:59:14,555 --> 00:59:17,725
What can I say? Last night
he said he had a headache.

785
00:59:17,815 --> 00:59:22,130
Then the throat pain. This
morning he has a stomach ache,

786
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,679
and now he says his legs ache.

787
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:28,892
My whole body is aching, dear.
- Uncle.

788
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:32,519
This is called
as Hong Kong illness.

789
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:34,713
Hammer.

790
00:59:34,803 --> 00:59:37,554
Hammer? What is he saying?

791
00:59:37,644 --> 00:59:39,339
Didn't you call a doctor?

792
00:59:39,429 --> 00:59:43,730
I've been telling him since
morning, but he refuses. - No!

793
00:59:44,695 --> 00:59:48,637
No doctor can treat
my illness dear.

794
00:59:49,675 --> 00:59:52,910
Only you can treat it.

795
00:59:53,262 --> 00:59:54,319
Me?

796
00:59:56,387 --> 00:59:58,676
My life is at your disposal.

797
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,410
Son, there's only one medicine.

798
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,684
To talk less. Solitude.

799
01:00:05,492 --> 01:00:09,123
If I stay in this room
alone for the whole day,

800
01:00:09,595 --> 01:00:11,796
you'll see me jumping
around after you return.

801
01:00:12,379 --> 01:00:16,269
I think we should
leave uncle alone.

802
01:00:16,803 --> 01:00:19,114
You go with him.

803
01:00:19,204 --> 01:00:22,922
I'll stay in my room, what
if uncle needs something then.

804
01:00:23,012 --> 01:00:24,682
That'll be fine.

805
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,133
That'll be fine.

806
01:00:28,633 --> 01:00:30,667
I have nothing to
fear if Aruna's here.

807
01:00:30,757 --> 01:00:34,357
She'll be talking
with the lawyer,

808
01:00:34,648 --> 01:00:37,262
and I could rest here calmly.

809
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,432
I'm saying,

810
01:00:41,845 --> 01:00:45,664
if he feels better when we he is
alone, then it's good to leave.

811
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:48,237
Uncle is very stubborn.

812
01:00:49,102 --> 01:00:50,547
Aruna, I'll leave.

813
01:00:50,637 --> 01:00:53,115
I'll call to find how uncle is.
- Okay.

814
01:00:57,970 --> 01:00:59,194
They've gone.

815
01:01:05,382 --> 01:01:07,679
Uncle, things are set!

816
01:01:08,404 --> 01:01:12,413
"The thing should work."

817
01:01:12,897 --> 01:01:15,963
Come.
- Excuse me, I'll be right back.

818
01:01:19,245 --> 01:01:24,985
"The thing should work"

819
01:01:29,131 --> 01:01:31,083
Walk carefully,

820
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:34,157
the steps are very old.

821
01:01:34,466 --> 01:01:36,787
Who know when they might slip?

822
01:01:36,877 --> 01:01:38,515
This way.

823
01:01:43,965 --> 01:01:45,673
Where have you brought me?

824
01:01:45,763 --> 01:01:48,020
The past.

825
01:01:48,613 --> 01:01:53,042
History isn't only
about places and structures.

826
01:01:53,631 --> 01:01:59,086
It isn't always written on
silver paper with a golden pen.

827
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:02,744
Can this place too
have a history? - Yes.

828
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:05,715
Even this ruin has its own story.

829
01:02:07,132 --> 01:02:09,090
There's a beautiful
love story beneath

830
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:12,249
these mute stones.
- Then say.

831
01:02:19,317 --> 01:02:25,048
"In this place. In this ruin."

832
01:02:26,174 --> 01:02:31,381
"In this desolate place."

833
01:02:32,342 --> 01:02:43,213
"It's said that two lovers met.
Once upon a time."

834
01:02:43,638 --> 01:02:44,663
Really?

835
01:02:58,767 --> 01:03:05,334
"One was a nomad, the
other was a princess."

836
01:03:05,424 --> 01:03:12,115
"One was a nomad,
the other was a princess."

837
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:18,833
"This place narrates
their love story."

838
01:03:18,923 --> 01:03:25,495
"This place narrates
their love story."

839
01:03:25,585 --> 01:03:32,251
"One was a nomad,
the other was a princess."

840
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:52,469
"How they met, how
destiny played its game."

841
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:59,297
"Once, the nomad
passed by the castle."

842
01:04:02,692 --> 01:04:09,143
"It's a tradition for nomads
to sing. He played a song."

843
01:04:09,233 --> 01:04:15,798
"When she heard his voice,"

844
01:04:15,888 --> 01:04:19,584
"the princess just squirmed!"

845
01:04:22,512 --> 01:04:28,506
"She ordered this requester
to be present before her"

846
01:04:29,227 --> 01:04:35,856
"She ordered this requester
to be present before her"

847
01:04:35,946 --> 01:04:42,864
"Once, the nomad passed
by the castle."

848
01:04:56,037 --> 01:05:02,733
"After hearing the princess'
name, the nomad greeted her."

849
01:05:02,823 --> 01:05:09,494
"Love played its trick. The heart
gave a message to the other heart."

850
01:05:13,396 --> 01:05:19,695
"All people tell the truth."

851
01:05:20,053 --> 01:05:26,016
"The disease called
love is very grave."

852
01:05:26,106 --> 01:05:32,740
"The victim is always restless!"

853
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:38,269
"The nomad kindled a fire
in the princess's heart."

854
01:05:39,559 --> 01:05:46,171
"The nomad kindled a fire
in the princess's heart."

855
01:05:46,261 --> 01:05:53,173
"One was a nomad,
the other was a princess."

856
01:06:09,886 --> 01:06:16,453
"One night, the princess came
laden with diamonds and pearls."

857
01:06:16,543 --> 01:06:23,244
"She said, I'm ready,
I've left my house."

858
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:31,089
"The nomad said no."

859
01:06:33,304 --> 01:06:37,298
"Throw away the
diamonds and pearls."

860
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:46,548
"We have to live and die on love."

861
01:06:47,256 --> 01:06:53,063
"What do we have
to do with wealth?"

862
01:06:53,218 --> 01:06:59,371
"Love, in a moment made the tall
wall of the world collapse."

863
01:06:59,922 --> 01:07:06,516
"Love, in a moment made the tall
wall of the world collapse."

864
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:12,865
"One was a nomad, the
other was a princess."

865
01:07:13,337 --> 01:07:19,892
"This place narrates
their love story."

866
01:07:19,982 --> 01:07:26,679
"One was a nomad,
the other was a princess."

867
01:07:44,426 --> 01:07:49,123
I think they are born
only to meet each other.

868
01:07:49,213 --> 01:07:53,113
But tomorrow we are back to Mumbai.
What then? - Hammer!

869
01:07:53,824 --> 01:07:57,790
Yes? - Like lord Shiv's trident.
Lord Hanuman's mace.

870
01:07:58,077 --> 01:07:59,578
As it my hammer.

871
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,699
I don't understand.

872
01:08:02,402 --> 01:08:08,204
We have to take our son-in-law
to his in-laws place.

873
01:08:08,294 --> 01:08:10,249
That's the problem, right?
- Correct.

874
01:08:10,679 --> 01:08:13,670
The solution is Nisha has
a travel agency in Mumbai.

875
01:08:13,907 --> 01:08:17,244
Yes. - We can call
Vijay there for a job.

876
01:08:17,886 --> 01:08:21,848
They can meet in office,
and he can visit us at home.

877
01:08:21,938 --> 01:08:24,857
Problem solved.
- Uncle, you're a genius.

878
01:08:24,947 --> 01:08:26,669
You realized now?
- They are here.

879
01:08:26,759 --> 01:08:27,889
Come dear!
- Hello!

880
01:08:28,609 --> 01:08:31,681
How are you feeling?
- Absolutely fine, dear.

881
01:08:31,771 --> 01:08:33,336
Here's some good news.

882
01:08:33,426 --> 01:08:37,393
What? - I've offered Vijay
a job in my travel agency.

883
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:44,141
So much joy at this
age is unable to bear!

884
01:08:44,499 --> 01:08:46,180
Son, aren't you happy?

885
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:51,392
I'm lucky for you to
think I'm capable of this.

886
01:08:51,946 --> 01:08:54,248
Okay. Vijay, see you in Mumbai.

887
01:08:54,338 --> 01:08:56,953
I'll definitely be there.
- All the best!

888
01:08:57,750 --> 01:08:58,634
Bye!

889
01:08:59,096 --> 01:09:02,060
How was your day?
- She's a very nice lady.

890
01:09:04,687 --> 01:09:09,463
Vijay, you come to Mumbai and rule.

891
01:09:10,887 --> 01:09:14,775
What?!
- I can't say how happy I am!

892
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:19,828
Sir, can I say something?

893
01:09:19,918 --> 01:09:24,045
The day I saw Nisha
for the first time,

894
01:09:24,135 --> 01:09:26,056
I said to myself,

895
01:09:26,389 --> 01:09:29,045
Viju, the doors of
destiny are going to open!

896
01:09:29,135 --> 01:09:30,589
And it has!

897
01:09:31,676 --> 01:09:34,330
With your permission, I'll leave.

898
01:09:36,397 --> 01:09:39,037
Greetings.
- Greetings.

899
01:09:41,971 --> 01:09:45,221
Hail god of the poor, you're great!

900
01:10:00,183 --> 01:10:01,765
'Vijay,'

901
01:10:01,855 --> 01:10:07,550
'I know your dreams for tomorrow.
But don't forget your past.'

902
01:10:08,263 --> 01:10:11,831
'The history which
gave you life, support,'

903
01:10:11,921 --> 01:10:14,250
'won't you look at it again?'

904
01:10:14,690 --> 01:10:16,007
'Won't you say goodbye?'

905
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:56,956
"One night the princess came
laden with diamonds and pearls."

906
01:10:57,046 --> 01:11:03,797
"She said, I'm ready,
I've left home."

907
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:12,822
"The nomad said no."

908
01:11:13,834 --> 01:11:17,342
"Throw away the
diamonds and pearls."

909
01:11:36,267 --> 01:11:39,704
Uncle, only god knows
whether I'm lucky or not.

910
01:11:40,642 --> 01:11:43,864
But I didn't know Nisha
was unlucky.

911
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:47,530
First you tried to
make her Mrs. Bhosle.

912
01:11:48,096 --> 01:11:49,718
Now Mrs. Nisha Guide.

913
01:11:50,492 --> 01:11:52,983
What's next, Mrs. Nisha Smuggler?

914
01:11:53,073 --> 01:11:55,464
Don't ruin what's happening.

915
01:11:55,996 --> 01:11:59,940
Didn't Kalidas say
what's in a name!

916
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:03,413
Uncle that was Shakespeare,
not Kalidas.

917
01:12:03,503 --> 01:12:08,759
When there's nothing in a name
what difference does it make?

918
01:12:09,871 --> 01:12:11,230
Really uncle,

919
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:15,972
if you were a lawyer, by now all
the judges would've resigned.

920
01:12:17,894 --> 01:12:21,207
I got to suffer the consequence
of Nisha's stupidity.

921
01:12:21,702 --> 01:12:24,137
What mistake did I do, uncle?

922
01:12:24,577 --> 01:12:25,568
Hello!

923
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:30,270
You should've waited for me before
saying yes to him for Aruna.

924
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:31,710
Had I been there then...

925
01:12:32,407 --> 01:12:35,817
He's coming by the
afternoon train today.

926
01:12:36,386 --> 01:12:38,330
Who?
- That Kalidas.

927
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:39,273
Kalidas?

928
01:12:39,363 --> 01:12:43,021
Don't hear to this fooI,
Viju is coming.

929
01:12:43,464 --> 01:12:44,892
Don't worry uncle,

930
01:12:44,982 --> 01:12:48,302
I told the manager to take
him directly to office.

931
01:12:48,392 --> 01:12:50,661
And I told him to
bring home directly.

932
01:12:51,185 --> 01:12:54,462
Dear, he's coming from far.
He'll be tired and...

933
01:12:59,218 --> 01:13:00,079
Hey!

934
01:13:00,819 --> 01:13:01,848
Who has come?

935
01:13:26,551 --> 01:13:27,701
Hello!

936
01:13:28,842 --> 01:13:30,192
Greetings uncle.

937
01:13:32,058 --> 01:13:33,844
Uncle, do you remember,

938
01:13:33,934 --> 01:13:37,051
Didn't I say I'm going to get lucky
the first time I met Ms. Nisha?

939
01:13:37,141 --> 01:13:38,415
Excuse me!

940
01:13:38,865 --> 01:13:42,769
Are you Viju Guide?
- I was.

941
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:45,252
Now I'm Vijay Thakhderwala.

942
01:13:46,428 --> 01:13:47,379
Nisha?!
- Yes?

943
01:13:47,469 --> 01:13:50,493
There's a saying, 'when god
gives, he gives open-heartedly'.

944
01:13:50,583 --> 01:13:53,260
But for me he opened the ground.

945
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:56,253
Remember the story, about
the princess and the nomad?

946
01:13:56,343 --> 01:13:59,669
Before leaving to Mumbai, I went
to bid farewell to the ruin.

947
01:13:59,904 --> 01:14:02,551
I found jewels on the ground and
took them to the government.

948
01:14:02,641 --> 01:14:05,434
The government gave
me 40% tax free.. - Vijay!

949
01:14:10,554 --> 01:14:11,992
Don't worry Mr. Sinha,

950
01:14:12,486 --> 01:14:15,427
Aruna knows better
about this contract,

951
01:14:15,967 --> 01:14:17,521
She'll be in Delhi by tomorrow,

952
01:14:17,611 --> 01:14:19,682
and stay there till the
negotiations are complete.

953
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:21,863
Right! Bye.

954
01:14:23,426 --> 01:14:28,220
Good news Nisha! We've
bagged the FCI contract!

955
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:31,117
We've won against
Khanna Industries this time.

956
01:14:31,376 --> 01:14:32,372
No!

957
01:14:32,853 --> 01:14:35,012
Khanna Industries
didn't float a tender.

958
01:14:35,974 --> 01:14:37,008
Why?

959
01:14:37,353 --> 01:14:38,986
That's exactly what I'm thinking!

960
01:14:39,678 --> 01:14:41,467
It's a big contract,

961
01:14:42,743 --> 01:14:44,861
What's Mr. Ravi Khanna doing?

962
01:15:05,831 --> 01:15:08,484
No one has benifited
by filing a case.

963
01:15:09,345 --> 01:15:11,565
Will Mr. Jankidas suffer a loss?

964
01:15:11,655 --> 01:15:15,766
Yes, his time and
money will be wasted.

965
01:15:16,466 --> 01:15:18,829
We'll be profited from his loss,

966
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:21,165
File a case Bharat.

967
01:15:21,873 --> 01:15:22,996
But not from here,

968
01:15:24,503 --> 01:15:28,979
file it from Delhi, Punjab,
Kashmir, Kanyakumari, Bhatinda.

969
01:15:30,290 --> 01:15:32,594
Make Mr. Jankidas run so much,

970
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:36,411
he won't dare betray
the Khanna family again.

971
01:15:36,748 --> 01:15:38,836
Okay. As you wish.

972
01:15:41,748 --> 01:15:43,799
Any news about Nisha?
- She's fine.

973
01:15:44,476 --> 01:15:48,476
But I thought you aren't
interested in her anymore.

974
01:15:49,134 --> 01:15:50,581
Never Bharat.

975
01:15:51,378 --> 01:15:53,169
Look at her strengths.

976
01:15:53,538 --> 01:15:56,914
After meeting her,
2 poor men became rich.

977
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:00,064
If Nisha could make
them billionaires,

978
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:01,936
what could she do for us?

979
01:16:10,225 --> 01:16:13,746
Okay, I'll leave.
- Bharat, meet Ms. Seema.

980
01:16:14,163 --> 01:16:15,628
He's my friend, Mr. Bharat.

981
01:16:15,718 --> 01:16:16,604
Hello!
- Hello.

982
01:16:16,694 --> 01:16:18,836
Seema is my fiance.
- Fiance?!

983
01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:22,157
You never told me
you got engaged...

984
01:16:23,038 --> 01:16:24,913
Certain things should be said

985
01:16:26,357 --> 01:16:28,456
at the right time.
- Yes.

986
01:16:28,874 --> 01:16:31,585
Okay, I'll leave. Congratulations!
- Thanks.

987
01:16:33,145 --> 01:16:36,084
Darling, how was your swim?

988
01:16:37,341 --> 01:16:38,976
What happened?
- Nothing.

989
01:16:39,621 --> 01:16:42,125
Darling, what happened?

990
01:16:43,746 --> 01:16:46,199
We've got engaged for
more than a year.

991
01:16:47,179 --> 01:16:50,216
I have a feeling,
I'll stay your fiance forever.

992
01:16:52,288 --> 01:16:53,581
You'll never marry me.

993
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:10,281
No, it won't stop.

994
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,864
No one stops at such a place.

995
01:17:13,572 --> 01:17:16,990
You spend millions on a car

996
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:20,541
then why not hire an expert
driver who knows about cars?

997
01:17:20,984 --> 01:17:23,573
This fool doesn't
know anything besides

998
01:17:23,663 --> 01:17:25,012
the petrol tank and steering.

999
01:17:29,621 --> 01:17:31,198
It's of no use!

1000
01:17:31,288 --> 01:17:32,918
Driver, enough!

1001
01:17:33,385 --> 01:17:36,748
Get a taxi. We can't wait longer.

1002
01:17:38,914 --> 01:17:42,781
Forget this car for 6 months. Once
it goes to the garage, that's it.

1003
01:17:42,871 --> 01:17:44,931
Uncle, I have an idea.

1004
01:17:45,492 --> 01:17:47,335
We have a total of 50-60 cars,

1005
01:17:47,425 --> 01:17:49,680
including office
and personal vehicles.

1006
01:17:50,299 --> 01:17:51,932
Why don't we start a garage?

1007
01:17:52,528 --> 01:17:54,063
I'll discuss this with Aruna.

1008
01:17:56,497 --> 01:17:58,991
Excuse me.

1009
01:17:59,751 --> 01:18:02,979
Yes?
- Are you a mechanic?

1010
01:18:04,228 --> 01:18:05,105
Yes.

1011
01:18:05,195 --> 01:18:09,671
My car has broken down. I'll be
grateful if you take a look.

1012
01:18:11,449 --> 01:18:12,506
All right!

1013
01:18:13,921 --> 01:18:15,282
What will he know?

1014
01:18:15,372 --> 01:18:19,435
We can tell from his face
he's never seen a Mercedes.

1015
01:18:19,715 --> 01:18:22,139
At least give him a chance.

1016
01:18:27,175 --> 01:18:31,020
Your car is fine now. Something
was stuck in the carburettor.

1017
01:18:31,486 --> 01:18:33,948
But get it to a garage soon.

1018
01:18:34,038 --> 01:18:36,091
It needs to be serviced
immediately. - Amazing!

1019
01:18:36,738 --> 01:18:38,257
Son, you're a magician!

1020
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:41,663
No, I'm a small mechanic,

1021
01:18:42,415 --> 01:18:45,006
who's never seen a Mercedes.

1022
01:18:46,182 --> 01:18:49,511
A poor mechanic,
hail the god of the poor!

1023
01:18:56,372 --> 01:18:59,891
Can I ask you a question?
- Yes.

1024
01:19:00,871 --> 01:19:02,781
Are you poor?
- What?

1025
01:19:03,268 --> 01:19:04,871
You're poor, right?

1026
01:19:05,374 --> 01:19:09,739
Weird! People ask for name,
address, business, religion.

1027
01:19:10,532 --> 01:19:13,171
After 25 years someone
asked for my status.

1028
01:19:13,261 --> 01:19:14,718
25 years!

1029
01:19:14,808 --> 01:19:18,032
Perfect! Absolutely fine!

1030
01:19:18,122 --> 01:19:20,349
But you haven't replied.

1031
01:19:21,330 --> 01:19:26,576
Sir, I'm very poor compared to you
guys. - Excellent. Very good!

1032
01:19:27,704 --> 01:19:28,678
Take this.

1033
01:19:30,163 --> 01:19:31,990
This much money for little work?

1034
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:35,120
Yes. But you have
to do something more.

1035
01:19:36,484 --> 01:19:38,672
I'm tired of Mumbai's garages.

1036
01:19:39,172 --> 01:19:43,543
It takes very long
for a car to get serviced.

1037
01:19:43,633 --> 01:19:45,235
You're a competent mechanic.

1038
01:19:45,558 --> 01:19:51,450
After you finish your work in the
evening and tend to our cars,

1039
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:54,510
I'd be very happy.
We'll pay you what you want.

1040
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:04,051
Okay. sir, I'll come.
Give me your address.

1041
01:20:04,768 --> 01:20:09,073
Wonderful! Address is Ashiana,
10th road, Juhu.

1042
01:20:09,163 --> 01:20:11,205
Ashiana, 10th road, Juhu.

1043
01:20:18,832 --> 01:20:19,965
Come son!

1044
01:20:22,872 --> 01:20:25,858
I've become a watch
waiting for you.

1045
01:20:27,247 --> 01:20:28,901
Is it any occasion?

1046
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:32,222
The house seems to be decorated.
- Not the house, the garage.

1047
01:20:32,626 --> 01:20:33,913
Come son.

1048
01:20:37,163 --> 01:20:39,621
Where do I start?

1049
01:20:40,304 --> 01:20:43,835
Start with this car.
- What's wrong with it?

1050
01:20:44,374 --> 01:20:47,618
That's your job.
My job is only to...

1051
01:20:47,708 --> 01:20:48,927
Anyway...

1052
01:20:54,437 --> 01:20:56,111
What's your name son?

1053
01:20:57,663 --> 01:20:59,823
What's a better name than son?

1054
01:20:59,913 --> 01:21:03,678
I haven't heard this
name since ages.

1055
01:21:04,497 --> 01:21:06,045
Okay, then so be it.

1056
01:21:07,286 --> 01:21:11,330
I hope that, one day...

1057
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:12,699
Anyway...

1058
01:21:21,288 --> 01:21:22,823
Son,

1059
01:21:22,913 --> 01:21:27,240
Since you're coming
here in the evenings,

1060
01:21:27,330 --> 01:21:30,877
does It upset your family?

1061
01:21:32,122 --> 01:21:35,880
I don't have a family,
I'm all alone. An orphan.

1062
01:21:36,455 --> 01:21:37,629
Orphan?

1063
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:39,853
That movie was a big hit.

1064
01:21:40,913 --> 01:21:45,055
Consider that story as my life.

1065
01:21:45,794 --> 01:21:47,207
Great!

1066
01:21:47,297 --> 01:21:51,296
You're poor and orphan.
BA, M.A. Wow!

1067
01:21:52,704 --> 01:21:58,074
Do you invent anything at home?

1068
01:21:58,831 --> 01:22:02,871
'Invent'. Rajesh Khanna from
a mechanic to a billionaire.

1069
01:22:03,194 --> 01:22:05,452
That happens in movies.
Not in life.

1070
01:22:05,725 --> 01:22:07,805
Unfortunately that
happens in reality too!

1071
01:22:08,283 --> 01:22:10,144
Haven't you heard
of Yashwant Rao Bhosle?

1072
01:22:11,345 --> 01:22:13,509
Yes! The one who came
in the newspapers?

1073
01:22:14,183 --> 01:22:17,944
He was literate.
I'm an illiterate.

1074
01:22:18,034 --> 01:22:22,111
Iliterate! Wow! PhD!

1075
01:22:22,704 --> 01:22:23,943
Last question!

1076
01:22:24,033 --> 01:22:27,521
What will you do if
you find a treasure?

1077
01:22:30,063 --> 01:22:33,194
I'll throw it away.
I'm a hard worker, sir.

1078
01:22:34,528 --> 01:22:38,080
Dilip Kumar. If money doesn't
have the fragrance of my sweat,

1079
01:22:39,099 --> 01:22:40,455
I won't accept it.

1080
01:22:40,545 --> 01:22:45,271
Great! Say that dialogue again.

1081
01:22:45,361 --> 01:22:47,497
Uncle.
- Yes?

1082
01:22:47,955 --> 01:22:50,063
Where are all the drivers?

1083
01:22:50,523 --> 01:22:54,048
Your blue Mercedes broke down on
the highway. They went to get it.

1084
01:22:54,138 --> 01:22:55,315
All of them?
- Yes!

1085
01:22:56,009 --> 01:22:58,866
One will steer, the rest will push.

1086
01:22:59,239 --> 01:23:02,890
Then he'll repair it.

1087
01:23:04,269 --> 01:23:07,071
Greetings, madam.
- Greetings. How are you?

1088
01:23:07,692 --> 01:23:08,756
I'm fine.

1089
01:23:10,358 --> 01:23:13,405
I have a party to attend.
Who'll take me?

1090
01:23:15,621 --> 01:23:17,240
How do I know?

1091
01:23:17,330 --> 01:23:19,043
I could drop you madam.

1092
01:23:19,133 --> 01:23:22,781
Yes, he'll be fine.
- No, don't take the trouble?

1093
01:23:22,871 --> 01:23:26,952
I have to test this car anyway.
I could do both together.

1094
01:23:27,042 --> 01:23:29,510
Come.
- All right. Thank you!

1095
01:23:32,816 --> 01:23:36,404
Don't wait for me, I'll be late.

1096
01:23:39,505 --> 01:23:40,837
That you'll be.

1097
01:23:41,632 --> 01:23:44,797
The later you be,
the work will be faster.

1098
01:23:46,821 --> 01:23:49,023
What's your name?
- Prakash.

1099
01:23:49,561 --> 01:23:52,381
I'm sorry, Prakash.
You're late because of me.

1100
01:23:52,471 --> 01:23:56,439
No madam, Can I ask you
something? - Of course.

1101
01:23:57,232 --> 01:24:00,271
Does your uncle stay with you?
- Yes. Why?

1102
01:24:01,132 --> 01:24:02,717
He's an interesting person.

1103
01:24:02,807 --> 01:24:05,120
He called me son
in our second meet!

1104
01:24:05,538 --> 01:24:07,080
Dear lord!

1105
01:24:29,436 --> 01:24:31,554
Madam, can I have a look?
Only 2 minutes. - Sure.

1106
01:25:13,994 --> 01:25:16,168
Hi darling!

1107
01:25:16,585 --> 01:25:19,591
Who are you waiting for
in this lonely place?

1108
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:23,889
Not you.
- What a melodious voice!

1109
01:25:24,891 --> 01:25:27,612
Your delicate neck is loaded!

1110
01:25:28,844 --> 01:25:31,413
Let me lighten your burden.

1111
01:25:32,145 --> 01:25:37,870
Beautiful hands!
Must not get twisted!

1112
01:25:39,559 --> 01:25:44,390
Salty fingers.
Shall I taste them.

1113
01:25:45,271 --> 01:25:48,663
Great! I told you...

1114
01:27:01,162 --> 01:27:02,333
Please come.

1115
01:27:03,833 --> 01:27:07,037
Come in please.
This is my small house.

1116
01:27:07,767 --> 01:27:08,753
Sit down.

1117
01:27:09,751 --> 01:27:11,681
I'll be right back.

1118
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:18,912
Aunt, bring some hot water.

1119
01:27:19,812 --> 01:27:20,819
Rosy!

1120
01:27:21,515 --> 01:27:22,763
Rosy!

1121
01:27:23,627 --> 01:27:26,162
What happened?
Why are you shouting?

1122
01:27:26,252 --> 01:27:28,495
Get Dettol and cotton quickly.

1123
01:27:29,644 --> 01:27:32,090
He's been in another fight.
- Give it to him.

1124
01:27:36,091 --> 01:27:40,984
Where are you hurt?
- I'm not hurt, Ms Nisha is.

1125
01:27:42,666 --> 01:27:43,683
I'll be right back.

1126
01:27:44,150 --> 01:27:46,995
Where are you hurt? - Don't worry!
It's a small wound.

1127
01:27:47,085 --> 01:27:51,680
A small injury can also
cause become big. Show me!

1128
01:27:53,837 --> 01:27:56,322
So you fought again.

1129
01:27:56,412 --> 01:27:57,735
I had to.

1130
01:27:57,825 --> 01:28:01,447
I was dropping madam home. Goons
tried to snatch madam's jewellery.

1131
01:28:01,537 --> 01:28:05,078
Madam? I work in the
evening at her place. Ms. Nisha!

1132
01:28:05,367 --> 01:28:08,412
You've started social work again.

1133
01:28:08,582 --> 01:28:10,162
You still have
sympathy for the rich.

1134
01:28:10,447 --> 01:28:13,769
You risked your life to
save that woman's jewellery?

1135
01:28:14,454 --> 01:28:18,058
Speak softly, she'll hear.
- Let her! I don't care!

1136
01:28:18,245 --> 01:28:20,087
I know these rich people very well.

1137
01:28:20,454 --> 01:28:22,863
After their job is done,
they don't even look back.

1138
01:28:22,953 --> 01:28:24,759
Stop your nonsense!
- No!

1139
01:28:27,167 --> 01:28:29,609
C'mon, put the medicine.
- I can't.

1140
01:28:29,911 --> 01:28:31,451
Do it yourself if you want to.

1141
01:28:31,822 --> 01:28:35,417
Rosy, aren't you ashamed of
misbehaving with a guest?

1142
01:28:35,866 --> 01:28:41,047
No, because rich people aren't
worthy of being called guests.

1143
01:28:41,363 --> 01:28:46,312
Stay in her house as a guest
after our homes are demolished.

1144
01:28:47,162 --> 01:28:49,231
Why will houses be demolished?

1145
01:28:49,495 --> 01:28:54,361
A rich like you deceived us
and took over this colony.

1146
01:28:54,763 --> 01:28:57,710
He made us sign papers by
enticing us with a house,

1147
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:59,201
water and electricity.

1148
01:28:59,291 --> 01:29:03,678
Now we found that the building
is to be built for the rich.

1149
01:29:03,886 --> 01:29:04,758
Rosy!

1150
01:29:04,848 --> 01:29:07,454
What has madam to
do with our problems?

1151
01:29:07,770 --> 01:29:09,288
That's right.

1152
01:29:09,579 --> 01:29:13,291
What has Nisha to
do with our problems?

1153
01:29:17,586 --> 01:29:20,221
Don't be offended
about what she said.

1154
01:29:20,508 --> 01:29:22,294
We're very worried these days.

1155
01:29:22,537 --> 01:29:25,945
I apologize for Rosy's behaviour.

1156
01:29:26,537 --> 01:29:29,920
I felt the pain behind
Rosy's behaviour.

1157
01:29:31,031 --> 01:29:33,384
Who betrayed you all?

1158
01:29:34,621 --> 01:29:36,418
His name is Jainth Amar Nath.

1159
01:29:38,257 --> 01:29:40,953
Jainth Amar Nath, Lion builders.

1160
01:29:41,474 --> 01:29:42,961
I took Nisha home,

1161
01:29:43,481 --> 01:29:46,170
applied medicine to her wound
and got her back.

1162
01:29:46,648 --> 01:29:48,161
That's wonderful!

1163
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:51,461
I never thought the
path would be smooth.

1164
01:29:52,119 --> 01:29:56,170
This is the first time Nisha
went to someone's house?

1165
01:29:56,260 --> 01:29:57,712
She wasn't willing to come.

1166
01:29:58,149 --> 01:30:00,447
I forced her because
she was bleeding.

1167
01:30:00,537 --> 01:30:03,816
That's the pity.
No one could force Nisha.

1168
01:30:04,326 --> 01:30:05,732
You continue.

1169
01:30:06,649 --> 01:30:10,171
If you force Nisha,
you'll have good results.

1170
01:30:11,893 --> 01:30:15,122
Forgive me, Sometimes
I don't understand you.

1171
01:30:15,791 --> 01:30:17,504
You will, when the time comes.

1172
01:30:18,433 --> 01:30:19,877
Tell me something,

1173
01:30:20,279 --> 01:30:23,008
whenever we give
the car to a mechanic

1174
01:30:23,098 --> 01:30:25,003
he goes beneath the car to check.

1175
01:30:25,254 --> 01:30:28,571
Hence I thought all the
parts of the car are below.

1176
01:30:28,844 --> 01:30:30,867
But you haven't gone beneath
not even once in these 2 days.

1177
01:30:31,587 --> 01:30:34,462
Check below too.

1178
01:30:34,794 --> 01:30:37,494
First we have to find
the problem from the top,

1179
01:30:37,958 --> 01:30:39,130
then go down to repair it.

1180
01:30:39,409 --> 01:30:43,039
Now I'm going down,
get me some water. - Sure.

1181
01:31:07,823 --> 01:31:09,421
Greetings!
- Greetings.

1182
01:31:09,763 --> 01:31:12,057
I'm glad I've met you.
- What is it?

1183
01:31:12,879 --> 01:31:15,207
It's a pity,
I couldn't help you out.

1184
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:19,799
I spoke to Amar Nath
but he's a rude man!

1185
01:31:20,696 --> 01:31:23,838
I told him to not to make
you vacate your land,

1186
01:31:23,928 --> 01:31:25,496
but he didn't listen.

1187
01:31:26,414 --> 01:31:30,294
You spoke to him for us?
- Yes.

1188
01:31:31,753 --> 01:31:35,302
Get me all your documents
regarding this case.

1189
01:31:35,912 --> 01:31:37,546
I want to show it to someone.

1190
01:31:37,947 --> 01:31:41,336
Ms. Nisha, why are you
doing all this for us?

1191
01:31:56,212 --> 01:31:57,006
Hey!

1192
01:31:57,096 --> 01:31:58,605
What's that noise?

1193
01:32:05,659 --> 01:32:08,867
Prakash, you said we would not be
able to do the veneration ceremony

1194
01:32:08,957 --> 01:32:11,193
since our colony is to be razed.

1195
01:32:11,283 --> 01:32:15,082
Yes! We received a
notice from the court.

1196
01:32:15,534 --> 01:32:18,584
We've received a stay order
from the same court.

1197
01:32:18,914 --> 01:32:20,981
Stay order! What?

1198
01:32:21,325 --> 01:32:23,982
The biggest court is
that of god, Prakash.

1199
01:32:24,072 --> 01:32:25,783
When the Goddess herself
wants the veneration,

1200
01:32:25,873 --> 01:32:27,742
who can flout her wishes?

1201
01:32:27,992 --> 01:32:29,283
Look!

1202
01:32:32,216 --> 01:32:35,893
Do you know which goddess is
responsible for all this, Rosy?

1203
01:32:36,238 --> 01:32:37,342
What do you mean?

1204
01:32:38,617 --> 01:32:39,644
Goddess Nisha.

1205
01:32:40,412 --> 01:32:41,818
This is all thanks to her.

1206
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:44,283
What are you saying?
- Yes.

1207
01:32:44,743 --> 01:32:45,763
Some time ago...

1208
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:03,617
Wow! Fantastic!

1209
01:33:05,343 --> 01:33:07,221
Surrounded by greenery
on all sides,

1210
01:33:08,283 --> 01:33:12,871
whiter than milk,
my bungalow of marble.

1211
01:33:14,650 --> 01:33:15,762
at the front....

1212
01:33:17,007 --> 01:33:18,677
A beautiful rose garden

1213
01:33:20,307 --> 01:33:21,358
And behind it,

1214
01:33:22,739 --> 01:33:24,644
a tennis court,

1215
01:33:26,158 --> 01:33:29,627
swimming pool
and rooms for the dogs.

1216
01:33:31,492 --> 01:33:34,422
Hail god!

1217
01:33:35,729 --> 01:33:36,839
Who is this monkey?

1218
01:33:37,367 --> 01:33:40,577
Our elders say monkeys are
human beings' ancestors.

1219
01:33:41,339 --> 01:33:44,145
So you can call me father.

1220
01:33:44,885 --> 01:33:46,384
Who's this rogue?

1221
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:50,569
You don't know me, I know you
very well! Mr. Jayant Amar Nath.

1222
01:33:50,659 --> 01:33:54,540
The whole world knows me.
- They don't know the real you.

1223
01:33:54,630 --> 01:33:59,138
You're a demon, who sucks the
poor's blood for your pleasure!

1224
01:34:00,059 --> 01:34:03,164
Our blood will be very expensive
for you, Mr. Amar Nath.

1225
01:34:03,646 --> 01:34:07,167
I have a habit of getting
expensive things for free.

1226
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:12,498
So are you a
scoundrel and a wretch!

1227
01:34:13,456 --> 01:34:16,223
Dogs like you lie beneath my cars.

1228
01:34:16,789 --> 01:34:20,139
But not this time, because
the law is on my side today.

1229
01:34:21,905 --> 01:34:25,591
The rich think the law
will always do their bidding.

1230
01:34:26,492 --> 01:34:30,684
But that same law has
supported us today.

1231
01:34:31,481 --> 01:34:33,377
Look at this. A stay order.

1232
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:43,952
I forgot that in a war you must
never consider your opponent weak.

1233
01:34:44,825 --> 01:34:47,688
Whether it's a woman or a child.

1234
01:35:03,796 --> 01:35:07,122
What are you doing
here at this hour Prakash?

1235
01:35:07,570 --> 01:35:12,090
We got the stay order
and we know you're responsible.

1236
01:35:12,617 --> 01:35:14,941
Did you think
I wouldn't come to thank?

1237
01:35:15,031 --> 01:35:16,647
There isn't any need to thank.

1238
01:35:17,070 --> 01:35:20,242
I thought of you as my own
and did what I could.

1239
01:35:20,584 --> 01:35:23,860
Excellent!
One should help their own.

1240
01:35:23,950 --> 01:35:26,647
But that isn't nice.

1241
01:35:26,737 --> 01:35:29,847
Because now I have a request
thinking of you as my own.

1242
01:35:29,937 --> 01:35:30,797
Request?!

1243
01:35:30,887 --> 01:35:33,200
Do you want me to go inside?
- No, this isn't a secret.

1244
01:35:33,290 --> 01:35:34,878
It isn't a secret?!

1245
01:35:35,369 --> 01:35:39,534
Nisha, we are having a celebration,
because of the stay order.

1246
01:35:39,624 --> 01:35:41,870
If you come,
we'll be doubly happy!

1247
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:44,151
Sure, why not!
She'll certainly go.

1248
01:35:44,241 --> 01:35:47,684
Right from childhood she enjoys
dancing and singing in colonies.

1249
01:35:49,503 --> 01:35:52,545
I'm sorry Prakash but I have
a very important appointment.

1250
01:35:52,781 --> 01:35:57,960
Because of one appointment,
you can't disappoint so many!

1251
01:35:58,417 --> 01:35:59,359
That's unfair!

1252
01:36:00,728 --> 01:36:01,908
Okay.

1253
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:04,950
I'll come, but a little late.

1254
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:07,461
We'll wait for you
however late it may be.

1255
01:36:07,862 --> 01:36:10,785
All right, goodnight.
- I'll take your leave sir.

1256
01:36:10,875 --> 01:36:14,089
Son, you have my blessings,

1257
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:17,304
so that my desires come true.

1258
01:36:18,990 --> 01:36:20,289
Oh God.

1259
01:36:28,145 --> 01:36:29,100
Hello!

1260
01:36:30,013 --> 01:36:31,007
Aruna!

1261
01:36:31,097 --> 01:36:33,932
Yes uncle, what news
do you have for me?

1262
01:36:34,379 --> 01:36:38,438
A lot, dear. Enough
to fill the whole Times!

1263
01:36:38,528 --> 01:36:42,375
For now, listen to the headlines.
I've found a poor boy for Nisha.

1264
01:36:42,847 --> 01:36:45,450
Oh uncle, not again!

1265
01:36:45,663 --> 01:36:48,188
Yes, his name is Prakash Mechanic.

1266
01:36:48,278 --> 01:36:50,948
He has studied only till 3rd
grade. - Prakash Mechanic?

1267
01:36:51,138 --> 01:36:54,294
Yes, the time from mechanic
to owner is nearing.

1268
01:36:54,737 --> 01:36:57,913
Return quickly, we have to make
arrangements for two weddings.

1269
01:36:58,823 --> 01:37:01,295
Uncle, where is Nisha?

1270
01:37:01,721 --> 01:37:06,065
She has gone with Prakash
mechanic to the colony to disco.

1271
01:37:06,811 --> 01:37:12,351
Imagine Prakash
and Nisha playing hide and seek

1272
01:37:12,441 --> 01:37:14,023
in the colony.

1273
01:37:33,492 --> 01:37:38,696
"Darling, you're a
guest in my heart."

1274
01:37:38,786 --> 01:37:42,438
"Darling, you're a guest
in my heart."

1275
01:37:42,528 --> 01:37:47,825
"Meet me; you aren't
a stranger to me."

1276
01:37:47,915 --> 01:37:51,408
"Meet me; you aren't
a stranger to me."

1277
01:37:51,498 --> 01:37:58,533
"You're in my eyes,
breath and dreams."

1278
01:37:58,623 --> 01:38:02,341
"My life, where are you going?"

1279
01:38:02,431 --> 01:38:07,440
"Darling, you're a guest
in my heart."

1280
01:38:07,530 --> 01:38:11,375
"Darling, you're a guest
in my heart."

1281
01:38:39,995 --> 01:38:41,910
"Eyes."

1282
01:38:43,265 --> 01:38:47,117
"Let our eyes meet."

1283
01:38:47,207 --> 01:38:50,689
"When we talk,
things will work out."

1284
01:38:50,779 --> 01:38:54,283
"When we talk,
things will work out."

1285
01:38:54,373 --> 01:38:57,894
"I can't sleep the entire night."

1286
01:38:57,984 --> 01:39:01,325
"I can't sleep the entire night."

1287
01:39:01,415 --> 01:39:04,617
"You aren't an innocent girl."

1288
01:39:04,707 --> 01:39:09,770
"Meet me; you aren't
a stranger to me."

1289
01:39:09,860 --> 01:39:14,009
"Meet me; you aren't
a stranger to me."

1290
01:39:44,063 --> 01:39:46,367
"In your love."

1291
01:39:47,713 --> 01:39:51,289
"Defamed in your love."

1292
01:39:51,379 --> 01:40:00,117
"Thinking of you, I've
forgotten my own name."

1293
01:40:00,368 --> 01:40:03,909
"I've forgotten my own name."

1294
01:40:03,999 --> 01:40:07,241
"Now you're my identity."

1295
01:40:07,331 --> 01:40:12,154
"Darling, you're a guest
in my heart."

1296
01:40:12,244 --> 01:40:16,278
"Darling, you're a guest
in my heart."

1297
01:40:46,301 --> 01:40:48,992
"I had once.."

1298
01:40:49,614 --> 01:40:56,683
"I had once prayed for
a beloved like you."

1299
01:40:56,981 --> 01:41:00,325
"I had once prayed
for a beloved like you."

1300
01:41:00,415 --> 01:41:03,825
"My lover, thank you."

1301
01:41:04,032 --> 01:41:07,424
"My lover, thank you."

1302
01:41:07,514 --> 01:41:10,659
"I've been obliged by you."

1303
01:41:10,970 --> 01:41:15,809
"Darling, you're
a guest in my heart."

1304
01:41:15,899 --> 01:41:19,235
"You aren't unknown to me."

1305
01:41:19,325 --> 01:41:22,749
"You're in my eyes,
you're in my breath."

1306
01:41:22,839 --> 01:41:26,331
"My life, where are you going?"

1307
01:41:26,754 --> 01:41:31,541
"Darling, you're a guest
in my heart."

1308
01:41:31,631 --> 01:41:35,614
"Darling, you're a guest
in my heart."

1309
01:41:41,191 --> 01:41:44,044
Black clouds float
in the sky Mr. Pratap.

1310
01:41:45,113 --> 01:41:49,602
Ms Nisha Singh's interference
can prove to be dangerous for us.

1311
01:41:49,891 --> 01:41:52,271
Sir, how can a woman hurt you?

1312
01:41:52,361 --> 01:41:57,379
Had she been just a woman
there would be nothing to worry.

1313
01:41:58,405 --> 01:42:02,913
She wants to be the messiah of
the poor and protect my enemies.

1314
01:42:03,143 --> 01:42:04,629
May I ask you something?
- Yes.

1315
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:06,208
Why do hate the poor so much?

1316
01:42:07,545 --> 01:42:11,625
Because of them
I'm all alone in the world.

1317
01:42:18,184 --> 01:42:19,037
Pratap,

1318
01:42:20,926 --> 01:42:22,537
twenty years ago,

1319
01:42:24,421 --> 01:42:25,770
when I wasn't what I am,

1320
01:42:27,474 --> 01:42:30,346
I used to be the poor man's friend.

1321
01:42:31,999 --> 01:42:33,417
I had a family then,

1322
01:42:34,629 --> 01:42:38,402
a wife and an innocent son.

1323
01:42:40,404 --> 01:42:41,847
One day, when I returned home

1324
01:42:43,692 --> 01:42:46,597
I found my home had
turned into a graveyard.

1325
01:42:48,185 --> 01:42:50,347
My world had been reduced to ashes,

1326
01:42:51,166 --> 01:42:54,047
because of those friends,
those poor people.

1327
01:42:55,265 --> 01:42:58,934
Since that day, I consider
the poor to be my enemy.

1328
01:43:33,970 --> 01:43:37,732
So, is everything arranged?
- Yes boss.

1329
01:43:39,929 --> 01:43:41,295
Today will be the climax.

1330
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:45,050
As soon as Aruna arrives, I'll get
both my daughters married.

1331
01:43:45,872 --> 01:43:49,849
No! Brothers, everyone
has to die one day.

1332
01:43:50,526 --> 01:43:53,902
But very few die with dignity.

1333
01:43:54,424 --> 01:43:57,526
Will all of you support me?
- Yes, we are all with you.

1334
01:43:57,616 --> 01:43:59,068
We are all with you.

1335
01:43:59,158 --> 01:44:01,367
What's the need for all this?

1336
01:44:01,457 --> 01:44:06,591
When Ms Nisha has found us
another place. - Try to understand!

1337
01:44:07,649 --> 01:44:11,490
We aren't fighting for
shelter but our land!

1338
01:44:12,398 --> 01:44:15,458
Ms Nisha, we never
experienced a mother's love,

1339
01:44:16,919 --> 01:44:20,022
but this slum has brought me up

1340
01:44:20,718 --> 01:44:23,392
like a mother with
love and affection.

1341
01:44:23,976 --> 01:44:28,646
Does anyone abandon his own
mother for a stepmother?

1342
01:44:29,598 --> 01:44:30,729
Understood, Inspector?

1343
01:44:31,537 --> 01:44:36,269
If my plan succeeds, there'll
be no slums in this city.

1344
01:44:36,816 --> 01:44:40,645
These aren't just slums,
but a cancer attacking the city.

1345
01:44:41,155 --> 01:44:43,002
It must be eradicated.

1346
01:44:43,092 --> 01:44:44,401
But where
will these poor people...

1347
01:44:44,942 --> 01:44:49,029
They'll move out of the city,
will come to work for us on foot.

1348
01:44:50,299 --> 01:44:51,472
Inspector,

1349
01:44:52,174 --> 01:44:57,017
why not burn the slum
instead of demolishing it?

1350
01:45:01,786 --> 01:45:05,803
Even dry sticks
are here for burning.

1351
01:45:06,953 --> 01:45:11,847
Mr. Inspector, control them.
They want to obstruct it.

1352
01:45:13,885 --> 01:45:16,945
No Mr. Inspector, we
won't obstruct anything.

1353
01:45:17,193 --> 01:45:19,948
I knew it! Cowards!

1354
01:45:23,912 --> 01:45:25,518
But we won't move from the road!

1355
01:45:26,096 --> 01:45:28,515
These bulldozers can
move over our dead bodies.

1356
01:45:28,894 --> 01:45:30,779
Excellent!

1357
01:45:31,654 --> 01:45:36,282
I've heard a land irrigated
with blood is more fertile.

1358
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:39,603
My Nisha will be a widow
even before she get married?!

1359
01:45:40,277 --> 01:45:42,047
Oh Mr. Poor, where are you?

1360
01:45:43,437 --> 01:45:47,363
Don't obstruct else
we'll have to use force.

1361
01:45:48,830 --> 01:45:51,243
Take them.
- Come, Rosy. You come, too.

1362
01:45:54,464 --> 01:45:57,573
Catch this rascal, he's the
root cause of all problems.

1363
01:46:23,522 --> 01:46:24,878
Wait!

1364
01:46:27,693 --> 01:46:31,356
Munna! My son!

1365
01:46:33,165 --> 01:46:35,386
Munna!

1366
01:46:35,666 --> 01:46:37,929
Munna?
- My name isn't Munna.

1367
01:46:38,402 --> 01:46:40,801
Son, your name is Munna,
you're my son.

1368
01:46:40,891 --> 01:46:45,909
That's your birthmark!
You're my lost child.

1369
01:46:45,999 --> 01:46:49,321
No! I can't be your son.
I'm a poor orphan.

1370
01:46:49,411 --> 01:46:51,317
No! You aren't poor; or an orphan!

1371
01:46:51,989 --> 01:46:55,325
You're a millionaire,
heir to all my wealth.

1372
01:46:58,032 --> 01:46:59,408
I can't.

1373
01:46:59,498 --> 01:47:01,471
Why son?
- For a house of my own,

1374
01:47:01,561 --> 01:47:03,154
I can't see them all
rendered homeless.

1375
01:47:03,244 --> 01:47:06,689
They won't be rendered homeless.

1376
01:47:06,779 --> 01:47:11,533
I'll construct houses of cement
for them. I'll make a heaven!

1377
01:47:11,623 --> 01:47:14,586
I swear! Come with me.
- Father, you're so kind.

1378
01:47:14,794 --> 01:47:18,269
But if you want your son, you have
to accept your daughter-in-law too.

1379
01:47:18,971 --> 01:47:20,575
Daughter-in-law?
- Yes.

1380
01:47:20,830 --> 01:47:26,700
Am I so blessed that
I have a daughter-in-law too?

1381
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,154
Who is she, son?

1382
01:47:34,406 --> 01:47:37,200
Go, Nisha, don't delay.

1383
01:47:37,582 --> 01:47:39,474
Hail the saint of the poor.

1384
01:47:41,572 --> 01:47:43,384
Go Rosy!

1385
01:47:43,971 --> 01:47:46,915
Can I go brother?
- Go, sister.

1386
01:48:01,773 --> 01:48:02,863
Enough,

1387
01:48:03,591 --> 01:48:05,008
I can't tolerate anymore.

1388
01:48:07,513 --> 01:48:10,244
There's one option.
- No!

1389
01:48:11,023 --> 01:48:13,322
Pundit Bhavishyanarayan Agnihotri.

1390
01:48:32,753 --> 01:48:36,464
Sage! Why isn't he
answering my question?

1391
01:48:36,554 --> 01:48:39,449
Because he doesn't know.
He's silent.

1392
01:48:39,981 --> 01:48:43,932
Foolish disciple, you're taking
advantage of the sage's silence.

1393
01:48:44,590 --> 01:48:49,604
I don't know the answer!
I myself am the question.

1394
01:48:49,694 --> 01:48:55,502
My name is Pundit Chakravyuh
Bhavishyanarayan Agnihotri.

1395
01:48:55,991 --> 01:48:59,060
Everything in this world knows me.

1396
01:48:59,150 --> 01:49:02,196
And I know everything
in this world.

1397
01:49:02,286 --> 01:49:07,402
From politics to
experience to snakes.

1398
01:49:07,492 --> 01:49:11,800
Even sexual diseases fear me.

1399
01:49:11,890 --> 01:49:14,464
Child you've come to me,

1400
01:49:14,554 --> 01:49:18,864
hence you'll pass
the examination.

1401
01:49:19,541 --> 01:49:23,384
Saint, are you really
sure I'll pass?

1402
01:49:23,474 --> 01:49:25,480
I haven't answered
half the papers.

1403
01:49:25,570 --> 01:49:30,456
Whether you answer the examinations
or not, give me my donation.

1404
01:49:30,546 --> 01:49:36,005
Fill my grail with notes,
my bag with money.

1405
01:49:36,095 --> 01:49:39,772
And I'll fill your
brain with knowledge.

1406
01:49:39,951 --> 01:49:41,824
As you say, saint.

1407
01:49:43,729 --> 01:49:45,724
Tejgari.
- Yes sage?

1408
01:49:45,814 --> 01:49:48,641
Coin
- Coin!

1409
01:49:48,932 --> 01:49:51,868
Foolish child, you'll
pass the examinations,

1410
01:49:51,958 --> 01:49:57,624
but with a third class and
you'll be jobless all your life.

1411
01:49:57,714 --> 01:50:02,039
Saint, you handle my exams,
I'll take care of my life.

1412
01:50:03,197 --> 01:50:09,143
He shook my seat and went away.

1413
01:50:09,551 --> 01:50:13,157
Go!
- Saint!

1414
01:50:13,247 --> 01:50:17,533
The sage is angry, if anyone wants
to ask something, ask, or leave.

1415
01:50:17,623 --> 01:50:20,412
Go. Calm down, sage!

1416
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:23,306
xxx. Sage!

1417
01:50:23,893 --> 01:50:27,534
Disciple, we are done.
- No!

1418
01:50:27,624 --> 01:50:30,702
Take out the cigarette.

1419
01:50:31,212 --> 01:50:32,550
Take out!

1420
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:34,241
So small? - Things are
very expensive these days.

1421
01:50:34,331 --> 01:50:39,579
Light it. Don't burn
the beard, it's rented.

1422
01:50:46,956 --> 01:50:49,349
Oh disco dancer,

1423
01:50:49,439 --> 01:50:53,033
who is this beast with beauty?

1424
01:50:53,123 --> 01:50:54,601
Sage!

1425
01:50:54,691 --> 01:50:59,151
This is the same Ms Nisha, whose
uncle made an appointment with you.

1426
01:50:59,241 --> 01:51:01,921
Ms Nisha, a millionaire!

1427
01:51:02,011 --> 01:51:07,313
Then sit on the seat, stub out the
cigarette and put up the ladder.

1428
01:51:16,724 --> 01:51:18,054
Greetings.

1429
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:20,409
Be happy forever.

1430
01:51:22,283 --> 01:51:23,619
The saint is calling you.

1431
01:51:29,714 --> 01:51:31,222
What a fortune.

1432
01:51:31,312 --> 01:51:35,162
The Moon enters
scorpion through Gemini.

1433
01:51:36,713 --> 01:51:38,210
Sit.

1434
01:51:42,288 --> 01:51:43,866
The saint wants to see your hand.

1435
01:51:47,978 --> 01:51:49,958
Very beautiful!

1436
01:51:50,558 --> 01:51:55,942
Your name starts with the
letter N and ends with an A.

1437
01:51:56,032 --> 01:51:58,109
You're still unmarried.

1438
01:51:58,199 --> 01:52:01,463
And even if you're married,
it won't last long.

1439
01:52:01,553 --> 01:52:05,056
Your dead brother's name is
Ashoka the great.

1440
01:52:05,146 --> 01:52:07,556
And even if it's not, it must've
been in a previous birth.

1441
01:52:07,646 --> 01:52:11,662
Your daughter's name starts
with K and ends with R.

1442
01:52:11,752 --> 01:52:16,666
And if not, then change it or she
will change you. Any question?

1443
01:52:16,756 --> 01:52:20,426
Saint, I want to ask you
a small question. - Ask!

1444
01:52:20,516 --> 01:52:22,291
When will my niece get married?

1445
01:52:22,521 --> 01:52:26,666
She'll definitely get
married to a respectable, .

1446
01:52:26,756 --> 01:52:31,800
Educated, strong, sexy,
and rich man.

1447
01:52:33,502 --> 01:52:36,754
A rich man?
- Yes, a millionaire!

1448
01:52:36,844 --> 01:52:40,255
No, don't say that.

1449
01:52:40,443 --> 01:52:45,208
Don't use the word rich,
my niece hates that word.

1450
01:52:45,769 --> 01:52:51,526
Very surprising!

1451
01:52:52,047 --> 01:52:56,446
You hate the word
'millionaire'? Why?

1452
01:52:58,046 --> 01:53:00,223
Because Pundit - No,
child not in English.

1453
01:53:00,722 --> 01:53:03,999
Yes, tell me the reason.

1454
01:53:04,335 --> 01:53:07,148
Because a rich person is
only concerned about money.

1455
01:53:07,238 --> 01:53:11,216
Absolutely right.

1456
01:53:11,306 --> 01:53:14,935
God doesn't reside in the heart
of people...

1457
01:53:15,025 --> 01:53:18,374
who have lots of money.

1458
01:53:18,464 --> 01:53:23,019
His heart consist of
bundles of notes only.

1459
01:53:23,109 --> 01:53:27,986
A person without god in his heart
isn't a human being, but a devil.

1460
01:53:28,076 --> 01:53:31,261
I bless you, so you marry...

1461
01:53:31,351 --> 01:53:34,561
the poorest person of the century.

1462
01:53:34,651 --> 01:53:37,929
Touch his feet child.

1463
01:53:39,335 --> 01:53:41,452
Now that you've touched my feet,

1464
01:53:41,542 --> 01:53:46,441
I'll introduce you
to the poorest of the poor.

1465
01:53:46,531 --> 01:53:48,794
One minute.

1466
01:54:04,112 --> 01:54:07,539
The one you touched became yours.

1467
01:54:08,674 --> 01:54:11,332
Saint, what are you saying?

1468
01:54:12,265 --> 01:54:15,512
30 years ago, whatever you
predicted about me came true.

1469
01:54:16,117 --> 01:54:18,051
And today you're talking nonsense!

1470
01:54:18,141 --> 01:54:22,825
Forgive me, I'm not
Bhavishyanarayan.

1471
01:54:22,915 --> 01:54:26,351
I'm his son Nagadnarayan,
of the grass roots,

1472
01:54:26,441 --> 01:54:29,333
metric failed, alias John Travolta.

1473
01:54:29,423 --> 01:54:33,850
I was jobless, so I put on a beard
and pretended to be my father.

1474
01:54:33,940 --> 01:54:36,604
But uncle, I assure you,

1475
01:54:36,694 --> 01:54:41,283
you won't find a poorer,
more unfortunate,

1476
01:54:41,373 --> 01:54:45,684
lazier husband than me, even
if you go searching with a lamp.

1477
01:54:45,774 --> 01:54:48,057
Madam, accept me.

1478
01:54:48,147 --> 01:54:50,399
Cheat! Fraud!
- Cheat! Fraud!

1479
01:54:50,489 --> 01:54:51,443
Do I call them?
- Call them?

1480
01:54:51,533 --> 01:54:52,737
Who?
- Police!

1481
01:54:52,827 --> 01:54:54,071
Police!

1482
01:54:54,161 --> 01:54:59,088
At least think about my late
father. Whatever he said was true.

1483
01:55:00,153 --> 01:55:01,988
I'm letting you go because of him.

1484
01:55:02,078 --> 01:55:04,279
But leave for Banaras
immediately. - Yes!

1485
01:55:04,369 --> 01:55:09,068
Understood? Come, child. - Child!
I mean dear! She's left!

1486
01:55:09,158 --> 01:55:13,125
Disciple, come we'll go
to Banaras and sell bananas.

1487
01:55:13,556 --> 01:55:14,920
Wow, Mr. Lawyer.

1488
01:55:15,347 --> 01:55:16,466
Congratulations!

1489
01:55:17,362 --> 01:55:20,701
You've outdone me
when it comes to marriage.

1490
01:55:20,791 --> 01:55:25,691
Yes Mr. Khanna. Uncle got tired
of hunting for someone poor.

1491
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:30,640
So to reduce his stress,
he's letting me get married.

1492
01:55:30,730 --> 01:55:32,458
Congratulations once again!

1493
01:55:33,176 --> 01:55:35,872
But now I must do something myself.

1494
01:55:36,418 --> 01:55:41,006
I have to meet Ms Nisha at your
wedding. - Sure, Mr. Khanna but..

1495
01:55:41,096 --> 01:55:47,057
Don't worry, Bharat, I won't
let your wedding be dull.

1496
01:55:47,491 --> 01:55:51,674
Now listen carefully,
and do as I say.

1497
01:56:24,078 --> 01:56:28,024
Mr. Khanna!
- Congratulations!

1498
01:56:29,399 --> 01:56:32,480
So you're the famous
Aruna Chaudhary.

1499
01:56:32,570 --> 01:56:37,533
Wrong! Now the not so
famous Mrs. Bharat Sinha.

1500
01:56:37,623 --> 01:56:39,593
Bharat has told me
a lot about you.

1501
01:56:39,683 --> 01:56:41,874
Sister-in-law, lawyer
has robbed me often.

1502
01:56:42,247 --> 01:56:44,680
So this gift is only for you.

1503
01:56:45,235 --> 01:56:48,305
Here's a small gift.
- Thank you so much!

1504
01:56:48,395 --> 01:56:52,048
Mr. Khanna, let me introduce
you to Ms. Nisha.

1505
01:56:53,588 --> 01:56:55,334
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1506
01:56:55,424 --> 01:56:57,099
Pleasure?

1507
01:56:58,039 --> 01:57:01,685
But I heard you
hate the very name Khanna.

1508
01:57:01,775 --> 01:57:03,812
You've heard it wrong, Mr. Khanna.

1509
01:57:03,902 --> 01:57:06,246
It's not hatred,

1510
01:57:06,336 --> 01:57:09,277
but enmity. And
not with your name or family.

1511
01:57:09,585 --> 01:57:12,441
But with Khanna
Group of Industries.

1512
01:57:13,186 --> 01:57:17,657
But we don't hate you, and we
don't even compete with women.

1513
01:57:18,371 --> 01:57:21,145
Because in our eyes, there
are only four types of women.

1514
01:57:21,718 --> 01:57:25,272
Mother, sister, daughter and wife.

1515
01:57:25,834 --> 01:57:27,618
But there are many types of men.

1516
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:30,833
And I don't know
yet what kind you are.

1517
01:57:30,923 --> 01:57:34,000
Order!

1518
01:57:34,802 --> 01:57:35,974
Ceasefire.

1519
01:57:38,764 --> 01:57:40,269
Ceasefire.

1520
01:58:22,737 --> 01:58:25,721
"Who are you?"
- "Me?"

1521
01:58:26,763 --> 01:58:32,274
"I'm a Punjabi Indian."

1522
01:58:35,996 --> 01:58:42,737
"I'm a Punjabi Indian."

1523
01:58:42,827 --> 01:58:45,113
"My walk is flamboyant."

1524
01:58:45,203 --> 01:58:49,018
"The city's liquor
can't be compared"

1525
01:58:49,108 --> 01:58:53,673
"to the water in my village."

1526
01:58:53,763 --> 01:58:58,314
"My country is great."

1527
01:58:58,404 --> 01:59:02,522
"My country is great."

1528
01:59:02,612 --> 01:59:07,306
"There's no other Punjab."

1529
01:59:07,396 --> 01:59:11,876
"My country is great."

1530
01:59:11,966 --> 01:59:16,358
"My country is great."

1531
01:59:34,343 --> 01:59:38,629
"I don't have money."

1532
01:59:39,006 --> 01:59:42,860
"But still, there's
no one like me."

1533
01:59:44,035 --> 01:59:48,900
"But still,
there's no one like me."

1534
01:59:49,227 --> 01:59:53,504
"I entertain people."

1535
01:59:53,844 --> 01:59:57,799
"I dance and I sing."

1536
01:59:58,888 --> 02:00:03,701
"My job is to sing and play.
I'm an ordinary man."

1537
02:00:03,791 --> 02:00:07,570
"Not a king or a prince."

1538
02:00:08,363 --> 02:00:12,921
"My country is great."

1539
02:00:13,011 --> 02:00:17,216
"My country is great."

1540
02:00:40,251 --> 02:00:48,956
"Love, romance and youth
are signs of my country."

1541
02:00:49,787 --> 02:00:54,870
"Love, romance and youth
are signs of my country."

1542
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:59,453
"Fairs are held on the river bank."

1543
02:00:59,543 --> 02:01:03,426
"But my days and
nights are lonely."

1544
02:01:04,447 --> 02:01:09,368
"I'm unfortunate since
I'm still a bachelor."

1545
02:01:09,458 --> 02:01:13,944
"There's no account of my sorrows."

1546
02:01:14,034 --> 02:01:18,629
"My country is great."

1547
02:01:18,719 --> 02:01:23,179
"My country is great."

1548
02:01:45,852 --> 02:01:50,290
"Girl, what's your name?"

1549
02:01:50,380 --> 02:01:54,995
"Why are you in the city?"

1550
02:01:55,085 --> 02:01:59,154
"Girl, what's your name?"

1551
02:01:59,244 --> 02:02:03,575
"Why are you in the city?"

1552
02:02:03,665 --> 02:02:07,928
"You look like a village girl."

1553
02:02:08,018 --> 02:02:12,954
"A string of threads of silk."

1554
02:02:13,172 --> 02:02:18,151
"Pardon my daring.
I'm admiring you."

1555
02:02:18,241 --> 02:02:22,305
"But I don't have bad intentions."

1556
02:02:22,623 --> 02:02:26,611
"My country is great."

1557
02:02:27,263 --> 02:02:31,964
"My country is great."

1558
02:03:00,573 --> 02:03:03,719
Madam, somebody's
here to meet you.

1559
02:03:05,063 --> 02:03:08,187
At this hour? What's his name?
- Nisha!

1560
02:03:08,700 --> 02:03:12,591
It's me, Suraj.
- You?!

1561
02:03:12,681 --> 02:03:13,705
Yes,

1562
02:03:14,381 --> 02:03:15,912
I've come to entertain you.

1563
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:19,397
I knew I'd find you sad.

1564
02:03:20,357 --> 02:03:23,647
Aren't you sad that
your sister left?

1565
02:03:26,491 --> 02:03:27,728
Thank you!

1566
02:03:28,917 --> 02:03:32,810
I'm sad too, because my
childhood friend has left.

1567
02:03:33,797 --> 02:03:37,566
Both of us get could be sad
together, hence I'm here.

1568
02:03:37,877 --> 02:03:40,201
That's good, sit.

1569
02:03:43,098 --> 02:03:46,905
Get some buttermilk.
Make it fast. - Yes.

1570
02:03:48,061 --> 02:03:50,419
But my sister and your friend
haven't gone away forever.

1571
02:03:50,901 --> 02:03:53,767
They're on their honeymoon and
will return in a few days.

1572
02:03:55,346 --> 02:03:57,458
Then you don't understand marriage.

1573
02:03:58,270 --> 02:04:01,440
Marriage is a pure relationship

1574
02:04:01,530 --> 02:04:04,557
that weakens all others.

1575
02:04:04,852 --> 02:04:06,780
You seem to have
a lot of experience.

1576
02:04:06,870 --> 02:04:09,116
Yes, you have just one sister.

1577
02:04:09,667 --> 02:04:13,509
I've had many worthless
friends since childhood.

1578
02:04:13,941 --> 02:04:16,570
After marraige they
became their wives slaves

1579
02:04:16,821 --> 02:04:18,596
and had no time for me.

1580
02:04:18,886 --> 02:04:19,977
Good for nothing creatures.

1581
02:04:20,533 --> 02:04:22,283
I can't say about Bharat,

1582
02:04:22,805 --> 02:04:25,344
but Aruna has been
anyone's slave,

1583
02:04:25,928 --> 02:04:26,948
it would mine.

1584
02:04:27,312 --> 02:04:29,174
She couldn't forget me so easily.

1585
02:04:29,673 --> 02:04:30,765
Maybe.

1586
02:04:31,505 --> 02:04:35,441
Anyway this disease is more
injurious to men than women.

1587
02:04:36,104 --> 02:04:41,721
I've noticed that marriage makes
a woman strong and a man weak.

1588
02:04:42,616 --> 02:04:44,985
Meaning you'll never get married.

1589
02:04:46,231 --> 02:04:47,237
Ms Nisha,

1590
02:04:48,067 --> 02:04:51,698
even if I want to,
who'd marry me?

1591
02:04:52,069 --> 02:04:53,857
Why, what's wrong with you?

1592
02:04:54,857 --> 02:04:57,732
I have just one flaw,

1593
02:04:58,184 --> 02:05:02,810
but it's so big,
it hides all my good points.

1594
02:05:03,747 --> 02:05:08,624
I'm very poor, Ms Nisha.
And no girl wants a poor man.

1595
02:05:09,226 --> 02:05:13,283
A woman only looks
for money in a man.

1596
02:05:13,858 --> 02:05:17,427
Whether he has property, villas!

1597
02:05:18,810 --> 02:05:20,418
I have nothing, Ms Nisha.

1598
02:05:21,077 --> 02:05:24,628
But if I get married,

1599
02:05:24,718 --> 02:05:29,009
I'll love my wife so much,

1600
02:05:29,099 --> 02:05:32,450
she'll forget everything.
I'll drown her in my love.

1601
02:05:33,812 --> 02:05:35,417
She'll be very lucky.

1602
02:05:37,337 --> 02:05:41,696
I came to entertain you and here
I am telling me sad story.

1603
02:05:42,120 --> 02:05:44,606
Come. Take me on a tour of Mumbai.

1604
02:06:07,742 --> 02:06:09,209
How much?
- Rs. 5.

1605
02:06:12,673 --> 02:06:14,699
How much?
- Rs. 5.

1606
02:06:15,688 --> 02:06:21,346
This is Rs. 4 and 1 from here.

1607
02:06:25,974 --> 02:06:27,701
Yes I was saying, Ms Nisha.

1608
02:06:27,791 --> 02:06:30,210
Why do you call me, Ms Nisha?

1609
02:06:31,065 --> 02:06:32,371
Just call me Nisha.

1610
02:06:36,754 --> 02:06:38,699
The girl has been
caught in the net.

1611
02:06:39,139 --> 02:06:42,855
What? You're marrying
that idiot Suraj?

1612
02:06:43,896 --> 02:06:46,454
Yes, any problem?

1613
02:06:46,741 --> 02:06:49,936
But how long will you discuss
the varieties of manure?

1614
02:06:50,816 --> 02:06:54,694
Yesterday he lectured me about the
problems of manure for 2 hours.

1615
02:06:55,440 --> 02:06:59,945
I felt like I had
turned into a lentil.

1616
02:07:00,035 --> 02:07:01,587
Marriage isn't child's play.

1617
02:07:02,089 --> 02:07:03,403
Uncle,

1618
02:07:04,858 --> 02:07:07,154
do you think I am a child?
- Yes.

1619
02:07:07,789 --> 02:07:10,051
I've thought about this a lot.

1620
02:07:11,240 --> 02:07:14,173
Ask him, if he's willing.

1621
02:07:14,263 --> 02:07:17,226
He'd have to be an
owl to refuse marriage!

1622
02:07:17,678 --> 02:07:19,014
Just ask him.

1623
02:07:20,024 --> 02:07:22,379
Ok. I'll talk to him today itself.

1624
02:07:23,479 --> 02:07:25,037
Send him to me, when he comes.

1625
02:07:25,998 --> 02:07:30,423
You have demands, too? Isn't
getting a girl like Nisha enough?

1626
02:07:30,697 --> 02:07:33,073
Because it's Nisha,
there are demands.

1627
02:07:35,395 --> 02:07:38,101
Okay, tell me, sir.

1628
02:07:38,191 --> 02:07:39,632
But I don't understand Punjabi.

1629
02:07:41,536 --> 02:07:45,173
First demand, this wedding
won't take place in Mumbai.

1630
02:07:46,062 --> 02:07:47,727
Because if it takes
place in Mumbai,

1631
02:07:47,817 --> 02:07:51,025
people will say Nisha
married a penniless man.

1632
02:07:51,544 --> 02:07:55,486
People will spread stories!
I can't bear that!

1633
02:07:56,313 --> 02:07:58,131
If we have the wedding
in our village,

1634
02:07:58,221 --> 02:08:01,588
people will say she's so lucky.

1635
02:08:01,678 --> 02:08:06,793
She's marrying such a respectable,
honest man. I like that!

1636
02:08:07,119 --> 02:08:12,324
So you want Nisha to get married in
a place where nobody knows us?

1637
02:08:12,414 --> 02:08:17,534
Do you know, even the Prime
Minister.. - Uncle, I agree.

1638
02:08:18,866 --> 02:08:21,288
That's settled.

1639
02:08:21,917 --> 02:08:24,886
My second demand is
that Nisha lives with me

1640
02:08:25,295 --> 02:08:27,873
in my village after marriage.

1641
02:08:27,963 --> 02:08:33,001
Wow, my niece, Nisha,
raised in luxury,

1642
02:08:33,091 --> 02:08:38,193
will live in your hut ?!
Very good!

1643
02:08:42,117 --> 02:08:45,366
I accept that condition.
- Yes! Then I'll leave.

1644
02:08:45,456 --> 02:08:46,701
Okay.

1645
02:08:46,791 --> 02:08:49,158
27th of this month
is a very auspicious day.

1646
02:08:49,699 --> 02:08:50,729
On the 27th,

1647
02:08:50,819 --> 02:08:53,797
I'll wait for you on platform
no. 2 of the Jagadri station.

1648
02:08:54,130 --> 02:08:57,493
Below the clock. From there,
I'll take you to my village.

1649
02:08:57,583 --> 02:08:59,529
Rukhtapur, where we'll be married.

1650
02:09:03,565 --> 02:09:05,378
I'm fine with that.
- Yes.

1651
02:09:08,749 --> 02:09:10,555
I agree too.

1652
02:09:10,835 --> 02:09:12,361
And so am I.

1653
02:09:12,451 --> 02:09:15,732
I'll see make you a producer,
not just a director.

1654
02:09:16,546 --> 02:09:19,597
You have to do under my direction.

1655
02:09:20,221 --> 02:09:22,161
I want you to create
a fake village.

1656
02:09:22,251 --> 02:09:26,077
Tomorrow itself I'll create
one with the art director.

1657
02:09:26,167 --> 02:09:29,991
What? - The village in the
movie 'Sholay' was Ramgarh.

1658
02:09:30,247 --> 02:09:33,621
Fine, set it up,
fill it with people.

1659
02:09:34,251 --> 02:09:36,962
But remember,

1660
02:09:39,099 --> 02:09:41,360
there should be no problem
with the wedding.

1661
02:09:42,129 --> 02:09:46,365
Once Nisha is married,

1662
02:09:46,732 --> 02:09:51,464
Ravi Khanna will make her
every night a wedding night.

1663
02:09:52,964 --> 02:09:54,790
'Rukta pur.'

1664
02:09:55,350 --> 02:09:59,758
So brothers and sisters,
this is the last rehearsal.

1665
02:09:59,848 --> 02:10:02,424
We have very little time left.

1666
02:10:02,514 --> 02:10:05,050
So let's be clear about everything.

1667
02:10:05,140 --> 02:10:09,043
Suraj will bring Ms Nisha

1668
02:10:09,133 --> 02:10:12,340
to the village on a
horse-cart to get married.

1669
02:10:12,430 --> 02:10:18,329
When you see them, leave your
work, run to welcome them.

1670
02:10:18,616 --> 02:10:21,989
Sir, you have been saying the
same thing for the past 4 days.

1671
02:10:22,347 --> 02:10:24,775
We know the scene, don't worry.

1672
02:10:24,865 --> 02:10:30,176
This isn't a movie, but a
real life scene, with no retakes.

1673
02:10:30,266 --> 02:10:31,919
Remember!

1674
02:10:32,009 --> 02:10:33,973
Now everybody get in position.

1675
02:10:45,220 --> 02:10:46,525
Action!

1676
02:11:02,311 --> 02:11:03,927
'Rukta pur.'

1677
02:11:06,150 --> 02:11:08,972
Suraj brother, you've come.

1678
02:11:11,226 --> 02:11:14,466
Brother, where's our
to-be sister-in-law?

1679
02:11:15,609 --> 02:11:19,043
Suraj, have you brought me toys?

1680
02:11:22,931 --> 02:11:25,253
Suraj, have you brought me a sari?

1681
02:11:28,332 --> 02:11:31,052
Suraj! Suraj!

1682
02:11:31,844 --> 02:11:34,932
Have you brought it?
- Yes!

1683
02:11:35,022 --> 02:11:38,381
I have something for everyone.
But first, let me get married.

1684
02:11:38,471 --> 02:11:42,241
C'mon quick! We have to make
arrangements for the ceremony.

1685
02:11:47,969 --> 02:11:51,489
Now I know why you were
keen on getting married here.

1686
02:11:51,579 --> 02:11:55,840
Yes, this is my village. It may
be small nevetheless my home.

1687
02:11:56,763 --> 02:11:59,454
Okay, go inside with
aunty and get ready.

1688
02:12:00,119 --> 02:12:02,608
Come my child, come inside.

1689
02:12:08,038 --> 02:12:10,549
Boss, how do you
like our arrangement?

1690
02:12:10,639 --> 02:12:13,201
You can easily tell
it's a fake village.

1691
02:12:13,675 --> 02:12:17,375
A movie set.

1692
02:12:19,114 --> 02:12:22,096
But it doesn't matter

1693
02:12:22,889 --> 02:12:26,216
because Nisha's seen
villages only in movies.

1694
02:12:27,022 --> 02:12:29,126
She won't realize anything.
- Boss,

1695
02:12:29,216 --> 02:12:31,263
Mr. Khanna has sent you a letter.

1696
02:12:31,353 --> 02:12:32,639
Mr. Khanna?

1697
02:12:45,123 --> 02:12:46,465
Ghaiya.

1698
02:12:46,555 --> 02:12:52,134
That old man with Nisha is very
dangerous. Keep an eye on him.

1699
02:12:52,453 --> 02:12:54,000
Okay, boss.
- Yes.

1700
02:12:54,802 --> 02:12:59,504
What's this?
Everything seems fake.

1701
02:13:01,472 --> 02:13:03,002
Is that a real priest?

1702
02:13:03,092 --> 02:13:06,002
Everything can be fake
but not the priest!

1703
02:13:06,092 --> 02:13:10,136
Don't worry boss,
the priest is 100% real.

1704
02:13:10,485 --> 02:13:13,408
Okay, keep it up.

1705
02:13:18,509 --> 02:13:20,287
Action!

1706
02:13:23,712 --> 02:13:27,787
Child, if I could,

1707
02:13:27,877 --> 02:13:31,744
I'd give you all the peace
in my heart.

1708
02:13:34,715 --> 02:13:37,841
Oh uncle, even you
should be in the snap.

1709
02:13:37,931 --> 02:13:40,382
Come, I'll take your snap!
Get back!

1710
02:13:40,472 --> 02:13:42,431
Okay!
- Give it!

1711
02:13:45,182 --> 02:13:48,096
Yes, ready, steady.

1712
02:13:48,186 --> 02:13:50,590
Smile, thank you!

1713
02:13:50,680 --> 02:13:53,514
I'll keep the camera
in your car. - Okay.

1714
02:13:55,038 --> 02:13:56,608
Okay child, I'll leave.

1715
02:13:57,477 --> 02:13:58,745
Long live, my child.

1716
02:14:02,646 --> 02:14:06,453
Suraj Singh, I'm leaving.
- Okay.

1717
02:14:07,007 --> 02:14:09,597
Take care of your health.

1718
02:14:09,857 --> 02:14:11,901
That's okay,
but right now, I'm going.

1719
02:14:11,991 --> 02:14:15,352
Yes, do visit us sometime.

1720
02:14:17,069 --> 02:14:21,514
Suraj Singh.
- I understand.

1721
02:14:24,013 --> 02:14:25,105
Goodbye.

1722
02:14:25,680 --> 02:14:26,760
Huh!

1723
02:14:34,820 --> 02:14:36,554
C'mon, driver.

1724
02:15:46,591 --> 02:15:49,487
Oil. Oil from my land.

1725
02:15:50,093 --> 02:15:51,805
What happened?

1726
02:15:54,040 --> 02:15:57,354
"I've become a big man."

1727
02:15:57,444 --> 02:15:59,939
"And look how
arrogant I've become!"

1728
02:16:00,670 --> 02:16:04,384
What's this?
- Oil from my land.

1729
02:16:05,245 --> 02:16:08,599
Now I'll be Burma-Shell Singh,
not Suraj Singh.

1730
02:16:08,689 --> 02:16:11,131
Millionaire!
Billionaire! Trillionaire!

1731
02:16:11,629 --> 02:16:15,374
You don't understand?
We are rich darling.

1732
02:16:15,464 --> 02:16:19,009
I'll be able to give you everything
a man should give his wife.

1733
02:16:19,099 --> 02:16:23,551
A bungalow, jewellery, car.
Whatever you ask for.

1734
02:16:31,596 --> 02:16:34,603
See how people swarm...

1735
02:16:34,693 --> 02:16:38,015
like flies around a rich man.

1736
02:16:40,763 --> 02:16:43,251
Seal it quickly or
we'll lose lakhs.

1737
02:16:43,341 --> 02:16:46,403
Heard that? They are
talking about lakhs.

1738
02:16:48,052 --> 02:16:50,374
Sir, he isn't listening.

1739
02:16:50,747 --> 02:16:52,929
Sir, this is my land.

1740
02:16:53,019 --> 02:16:58,115
Maybe, but the pipe below this
ground belongs to the company.

1741
02:17:17,303 --> 02:17:18,647
'Dear Aruna,'

1742
02:17:19,432 --> 02:17:23,737
'I've just received
the letter you posted 21 days ago.'

1743
02:17:25,043 --> 02:17:30,034
'You asked about my
life in Rukhtapur.'

1744
02:17:31,433 --> 02:17:36,322
'If peeped into the window
of my life,'

1745
02:17:37,216 --> 02:17:39,206
'you'd see this scene.'

1746
02:17:40,543 --> 02:17:42,845
'I get up in the
morning and make him tea.'

1747
02:17:51,347 --> 02:17:52,448
Tea!

1748
02:17:54,008 --> 02:17:56,035
I said tea.

1749
02:17:57,038 --> 02:17:58,398
Oh! God.

1750
02:18:07,763 --> 02:18:11,532
And then my husband's breakfast.

1751
02:18:22,426 --> 02:18:24,472
'You won't believe this,'

1752
02:18:24,562 --> 02:18:27,340
'but I have also learnt
to clean the house.'

1753
02:18:28,134 --> 02:18:31,622
'I go to the market
after doing the housework.'

1754
02:19:05,376 --> 02:19:07,195
Action!

1755
02:19:09,302 --> 02:19:12,046
Fast! Fast!

1756
02:19:13,569 --> 02:19:15,201
C'mon! Go!

1757
02:19:37,507 --> 02:19:41,417
'And then, yes, I cook the food.'

1758
02:19:42,346 --> 02:19:44,861
'My cooking is very weird.'

1759
02:19:45,304 --> 02:19:47,496
'Sometimes the food
is so tasteless,'

1760
02:19:47,586 --> 02:19:48,926
'I myself can't eat it.'

1761
02:19:49,721 --> 02:19:52,631
'And sometimes my husband
doesn't get tired of praising it!'

1762
02:19:52,721 --> 02:19:55,809
Wow, what a wonderful dish.

1763
02:19:55,899 --> 02:19:58,023
I followed a recipe.

1764
02:20:04,554 --> 02:20:05,764
You eat it.

1765
02:20:06,846 --> 02:20:10,472
Wife, in this country wives
die with their husbands.

1766
02:20:10,940 --> 02:20:13,684
And you're shy of eating
with your husband. Have some.

1767
02:20:20,721 --> 02:20:22,491
'And then I go to bring water.'

1768
02:20:22,846 --> 02:20:26,721
'Yes, if there is any similarity
between Mumbai and Rukhtapur,'

1769
02:20:26,811 --> 02:20:28,631
'it's the scarcity of water.'

1770
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:49,125
Action!

1771
02:21:08,705 --> 02:21:13,267
'And in the evening, comes the
man I wait for the whole day.'

1772
02:21:25,951 --> 02:21:27,365
Do you want tea?

1773
02:21:27,455 --> 02:21:32,192
Nisha, do you feel
very lonely here?

1774
02:21:32,379 --> 02:21:34,408
No, why?

1775
02:21:36,428 --> 02:21:41,262
No matter how much you lie,
I know you feel choked here.

1776
02:21:41,947 --> 02:21:46,438
You're lonely and you
don't know anybody but me.

1777
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:50,188
Sometimes I feel very bad,

1778
02:21:50,278 --> 02:21:54,870
that because of me - How can
you assume I only know you?

1779
02:21:56,161 --> 02:21:57,455
Who else?

1780
02:22:36,172 --> 02:22:39,257
Nisha! What happened?

1781
02:22:39,886 --> 02:22:41,330
Nisha, what happened?

1782
02:22:41,602 --> 02:22:44,177
Ghaniya, call the
doctor quickly. - Yes.

1783
02:22:44,490 --> 02:22:46,164
Call the mid-wife.

1784
02:22:47,503 --> 02:22:49,539
I should have listened to you.

1785
02:22:50,394 --> 02:22:53,607
I should've gone to the
city to some big hospital.

1786
02:22:53,697 --> 02:22:55,028
There's still time.

1787
02:22:55,118 --> 02:22:59,007
Do you want to go
to the city? - But now..

1788
02:22:59,097 --> 02:23:03,646
Do you want to go to
the city or not? - Yes.

1789
02:23:29,565 --> 02:23:31,469
Come quickly.

1790
02:23:33,109 --> 02:23:35,270
Be careful!

1791
02:23:35,360 --> 02:23:37,122
Easy, slowly.

1792
02:23:37,212 --> 02:23:39,491
Careful!

1793
02:23:39,581 --> 02:23:41,432
Careful!

1794
02:23:41,984 --> 02:23:43,943
Lend a hand.

1795
02:23:53,695 --> 02:23:55,702
You people go.
I'll park the car and come.

1796
02:24:04,111 --> 02:24:09,520
Aruna, in a history of 2000 years,
twins have graced our family!

1797
02:24:09,792 --> 02:24:12,689
Just pray both of them
resemble their mother.

1798
02:24:16,458 --> 02:24:18,105
There's Nisha's room.

1799
02:24:49,020 --> 02:24:51,200
So cute.

1800
02:24:54,533 --> 02:24:56,299
Did Nisha..

1801
02:24:58,136 --> 02:25:01,344
She doesn't even want to meet me.

1802
02:25:18,878 --> 02:25:20,004
Open the door.

1803
02:25:21,067 --> 02:25:22,461
I said open the door.

1804
02:25:23,981 --> 02:25:26,364
Why have you ruined me like this?

1805
02:25:26,939 --> 02:25:30,903
Why did you play with
my heart and my life?

1806
02:25:32,123 --> 02:25:33,809
Why did you perform this charade?

1807
02:25:35,601 --> 02:25:36,748
Charade?

1808
02:25:38,015 --> 02:25:41,487
We spent 12 romantic
months in that village,

1809
02:25:41,993 --> 02:25:43,285
and you call it a charade?

1810
02:25:43,720 --> 02:25:45,658
Did you feel even
for a single moment

1811
02:25:45,748 --> 02:25:47,617
that your love wasn't my love?

1812
02:25:47,839 --> 02:25:49,798
That your life isn't my life?

1813
02:25:50,593 --> 02:25:54,561
And the children, are they
also a part of the charade?

1814
02:25:55,277 --> 02:25:58,760
But you lied to me.
You can't be poor.

1815
02:25:59,226 --> 02:26:02,833
Maybe... maybe you're
even richer than me.

1816
02:26:03,964 --> 02:26:07,668
Not maybe, definitely.

1817
02:26:08,961 --> 02:26:10,560
I hate you.

1818
02:26:11,283 --> 02:26:16,862
No, you love me as
much as I love you.

1819
02:26:17,997 --> 02:26:20,608
And you know who made me lie?

1820
02:26:21,020 --> 02:26:24,152
You, all this happened
because of you.

1821
02:26:25,787 --> 02:26:28,489
I haven't seen a
fool like you, Nisha.

1822
02:26:29,272 --> 02:26:33,314
Do you think a person is identified
by his wealth or poverty?

1823
02:26:34,292 --> 02:26:36,812
Are all the rich devils
and the poor, saints?

1824
02:26:41,689 --> 02:26:44,895
And you're right.
I'm much richer than you.

1825
02:26:45,191 --> 02:26:48,471
I have mills, factories,
a very big business.

1826
02:26:48,953 --> 02:26:52,873
And I stayed in that
village with you for a year.

1827
02:26:52,963 --> 02:26:56,016
Just to prove my love for you.

1828
02:26:58,882 --> 02:27:02,351
I have said what I had to,
now it's up to you.

1829
02:27:03,828 --> 02:27:05,987
But who are you?

1830
02:27:06,422 --> 02:27:07,876
Whose wife am I?

1831
02:27:09,451 --> 02:27:11,866
My name is Ravi Khanna.

1832
02:27:11,956 --> 02:27:16,263
What? You're Ravi Khanna?!

1833
02:27:16,620 --> 02:27:20,450
100% and I m Ashok Khanna,

1834
02:27:21,159 --> 02:27:23,484
Ravi Khanna's younger brother.

1835
02:27:26,376 --> 02:27:27,934
Oh my god!

1836
02:27:28,024 --> 02:27:29,968
God is everyone's, sister-in-law.

1837
02:27:30,318 --> 02:27:36,064
But because of you, both
of us had to wait a year.

1838
02:27:36,154 --> 02:27:41,619
Now bless us and get
us married quickly.

1839
02:27:41,968 --> 02:27:43,258
Please!

1840
02:27:49,786 --> 02:27:53,159
Mr. Khanna, congratulations!

1841
02:27:55,311 --> 02:27:59,262
Mrs. Nisha, you are so lucky!

1842
02:27:59,352 --> 02:28:03,765
You're so fortunate, not one but
two, double congratulations!

1843
02:28:03,855 --> 02:28:06,136
Double thank you!

1844
02:28:06,440 --> 02:28:07,505
Wow!

1845
02:28:08,569 --> 02:28:10,201
What happened uncle?

1846
02:28:10,291 --> 02:28:11,867
Great!

1847
02:28:13,163 --> 02:28:16,364
Aruna knew, Bharat knew,

1848
02:28:16,952 --> 02:28:18,161
everyone knew,

1849
02:28:19,399 --> 02:28:22,141
but nobody told me.

1850
02:28:23,337 --> 02:28:24,862
and why should they?

1851
02:28:25,522 --> 02:28:27,823
After all I'm a silly old man.

1852
02:28:28,257 --> 02:28:33,372
But child, now that things are
settled and I'm no longer needed,

1853
02:28:34,219 --> 02:28:35,602
I'll go.

1854
02:28:36,787 --> 02:28:38,042
Be happy!

1855
02:28:39,643 --> 02:28:41,855
Uncle!
- Uncle!

1856
02:28:41,945 --> 02:28:43,742
Sir!
- Your honour!

1857
02:28:43,832 --> 02:28:45,924
Please!
- Uncle,

1858
02:28:46,266 --> 02:28:49,950
if you I go, who'll love
them like a grandfather?

1859
02:28:50,617 --> 02:28:56,572
Who will find a boy for
her and a girl for him?

1860
02:28:57,802 --> 02:28:59,020
Who?

1861
02:29:00,796 --> 02:29:01,733
I'm there!
