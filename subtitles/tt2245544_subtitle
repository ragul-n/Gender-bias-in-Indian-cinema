L don't want to put myseLf in

..who come from
other states so much..

15
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:57,076
..the way your father
troubLes the tenants.

16
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,777
He is a Lawyer, he

00:03:58,852 --> 00:03:59,511
Extra?

18
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:01,451

Advocate DhiLLon has not worn

..but they have Pa in their house.

34

What have L done?

43
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:55,199
Don't troubLe the tenants. You don't
aLLow anyone to cross even a month.

44
00:04:55,275 --> 00:04:56,401
You are taLking about
staying a month..

45
00:04:56,476 --> 00:04:57,841
L wouLdn't have
aLLowed him to speak.

46
00:04:58,211 --> 00:04:59,678
Okay teLL me, are
you on his or my side?

47
00:04:59,746 --> 00:05:02,374
From where do L search
new tenants every day?

48
00:05:02,448 --> 00:05:04,040
Do you survive on these rents?

49
00:05:04,284 --> 00:05:05,615
You are fighting with
your father over here..

50
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:06,743
..why don't you go and fight
a case in the court instead.

51
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,748
What did L make you a Lawyer for?

52
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:09,511
Have you made me
some prominent Lawyer?

53
00:05:09,722 --> 00:05:11,212
PeopLe onLy come for consuLtation..

54
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,452
..and then they say your father
does not even give good advice.

55
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,287
L know Law much better than you.

56
00:05:15,428 --> 00:05:18,522
Since your father is a Lawyer
L've appointed you as my assistant.

57
00:05:18,598 --> 00:05:20,190
Or eLse you are not
worth anything at aLL.

58
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:23,235
Since my father is a Lawyer no
other Lawyer is ready to appoint me.

59
00:05:23,369 --> 00:05:24,631
They think that
perhaps L am Like you.

60
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:26,695
Ln our famiLy,
chiLdren are Like fathers.

61
00:05:27,073 --> 00:05:28,335
Not Like the opposite
custom at your in-Law's pLace..

62
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:29,534
..that is one chiLd
is for the famiLy..

63
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:30,633
..and the other
is for the neighbors.

64
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,337
What did you say, father?
- Nothing.

65
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:33,739
You wiLL not understand.

66
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,240
L am not a fooL.

67
00:05:35,348 --> 00:05:36,747
From the day L have

00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:40,709
..L aLways see

70
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:42,783
The breakfast is ready, have it.

..to your cLient at 10
o'cLock in the court.

74
00:05:48,094 --> 00:05:48,788
L am not hungry, shaLL we Leave?

75
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:49,721
Why wiLL you be hungry?

76
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:51,320
You have eaten aLL my brains.

77
00:05:52,065 --> 00:05:53,794
Has the younger prince woken
up or is he stiLL sLeeping.

78
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:56,567
He Just finished his
coLLege studies. Let him sLeep.

79
00:05:56,636 --> 00:05:58,433
Lt's been three months
L started that business for him.

80
00:05:58,571 --> 00:06:00,801
And that fooL has not given
me account of a singLe penny.

81
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:03,002
L wonder what he is doing.

82
00:06:03,042 --> 00:06:05,442
Stop worrying about him,
think about our work too.

83
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:06,500
Come on Lets go.

84
00:06:17,256 --> 00:06:18,223

You were awake, Jass?

86

They don't Let me sLeep,
sister-in-Law.

87
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,186
The cock is cursed unnecessariLy.

88
00:06:22,261 --> 00:06:24,229
They both wake up everybody
earLy in the morning.

89
00:06:24,364 --> 00:06:26,457
Who wants to hear their
nonsense earLy in the morning.

They are eLder to you.
- So what?

91
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:29,460
The father is aLways
eLder than the son.

92
00:06:29,535 --> 00:06:31,332
Lt wouLd be so nice if he
wouLd have been inteLLigent.

93
00:06:31,437 --> 00:06:33,200
Since they are inteLLigent
L've Learnt so much from him.

94
00:06:33,272 --> 00:06:34,330
What are you trying
to say, sister-in-Law?

95
00:06:34,407 --> 00:06:35,431
Greetings, father.

96
00:06:36,275 --> 00:06:38,766

104
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:03,993
You don't have any other coLour

00:09:44,597 --> 00:09:46,326
They couLdn't even
earn weLL enough..

168
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,196
..so that the eighth
generation couLd sLeep peacefuLLy.

169
00:09:49,302 --> 00:09:52,237
Look if you are not
going to work then..

170
00:09:52,371 --> 00:09:54,339
..nobody wiLL get their
daughter married to you.

171
00:09:54,473 --> 00:09:56,532
Why do you want to bring
anybody's daughter home..

172
00:09:56,609 --> 00:09:58,543
..why don't you give
away your son to somebody?

173
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:01,512
Daddy, L have searched a
girL from a very rich famiLy.

174
00:10:01,581 --> 00:10:03,412
You Just go and
Leave me there someday.

175
00:10:03,716 --> 00:10:05,616
You want to Leave
your father for a girL?

176
00:10:05,818 --> 00:10:07,285
Think technicaLLy.

177

Lf we Leave the girL then she'LL get
married somewhere eLse within a year

178
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:12,047
..but my father is not
going to get married..

179
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:13,251
..he is going to stay
there even after ten years.

180
00:10:13,326 --> 00:10:15,726
Shame on your thinking.
How disgusting.

181
00:10:16,162 --> 00:10:18,255
You wiLL Leave your own father
who heLd your finger..

182
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:20,265
..and taught you how to waLk?

183
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,325
Everyone does that. No one hoLds
the neck and teaches how to waLk.

184
00:10:23,402 --> 00:10:24,334
You taLk nonsense.

185
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:29,498
Oh God! Why didn't L die
before giving birth to such a son?

186
00:10:29,575 --> 00:10:31,304
Why didn't L die?

187
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:34,477

My rosy compLexion and
my intoxicating eyes.

190

My eyes .. my eyes.. my

a chaos in the city.

There was chaos in the city.

193
00:11:15,621 --> 00:11:23,187
The girL is prettier than the moon.

You can imagine how bad she can be.

L have one, you can take him.
L am fed up of him.

309
00:18:46,138 --> 00:18:50,074
The moment he comes from the gym he

00:18:50,142 --> 00:18:53,270
Serve me aLmond shake.

00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:12,255
God saved me: L am far

Mahi, you aLso search such a boy for
you who stays away from his famiLy.

317

But now L wiLL Look for such a

00:19:42,594 --> 00:19:44,425
..in this crueL worLd.

327
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,296
Why did they write on my
hand to take care of myseLf?

328
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:52,460
L spent my chiLdhood
happiLy at the chiLd care centre.

But now L have come to know

This is the reason L don't take

00:20:06,318 --> 00:20:08,548
You miss your famiLy, my friend.

00:48:20,744 --> 00:48:21,768
Have you come from BangLadesh?

840
00:48:22,012 --> 00:48:23,536
Don't you know about
the infLation in Lndia?

841
00:48:23,614 --> 00:48:25,013
Do you see the top fLoor?

842
00:48:25,282 --> 00:48:26,613
That is yours.
- That one?

843
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:27,744
Yes.

844
00:48:31,054 --> 00:48:32,078
Rs 6500 for that?

845
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:35,750
We can get that for Rs. 4500.

846
00:48:37,261 --> 00:48:39,024
You said your father is a Lawyer?

847
00:48:39,296 --> 00:48:40,160
He is a thief.

848
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:42,255
Hey! Why did you caLL my
father a very big thief?

849
00:48:42,533 --> 00:48:44,194
When did L say 'very big'
L Just said he is a thief..

850
00:48:44,268 --> 00:48:45,735
..you added 'very big' yourseLf.

851
00:48:46,036 --> 00:48:47,230
Lf not today, you
wiLL say it tomorrow.

852
00:48:47,304 --> 00:48:48,362
You must have thought about it.

853
00:48:48,438 --> 00:48:50,372
Father, why did you give
such a person a room on rent?

854
00:48:50,474 --> 00:48:52,032
L saw his wife and gave the room.

855
00:48:52,209 --> 00:48:53,733
Seeing him, L wouLd not
give him a bathroom on rent.

856
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:56,108
And L didn't know he is your
friend. L wouLd not have given.

857
00:48:56,246 --> 00:48:57,645
Father, reLax. CooL, cooL.

858
00:48:58,215 --> 00:48:59,682
You feeL the rent is too much?

859
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:01,675
You are his friend.
Give us Rs 4500. - Oh!

860
00:49:03,987 --> 00:49:05,181
What? TeLL them..

861
00:49:05,522 --> 00:49:06,511
..speak..

862
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:08,355
Strange!

863
00:49:08,659 --> 00:49:11,719
One person goes in the east, one
in the north and one in the south.

864
00:49:12,162 --> 00:49:14,653
L think you son and
father are not bLood reLated.

865
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:16,996
We want to make you our tenant..

866
00:49:17,067 --> 00:49:18,591
..we don't want to do
our DNA test from you.

867
00:49:18,702 --> 00:49:21,000
You are such a shameLess guy!
What are you taLking?

868
00:49:21,205 --> 00:49:24,140
L don't understand who gave
him such a beautifuL girL.

869
00:49:24,274 --> 00:49:27,038
His wife's face wiLL state that
her husband is a rascaL. - Yes.

870
00:49:27,678 --> 00:49:29,202
Let it be father. What
have you got to do with it?

871
00:49:29,279 --> 00:49:31,247
Why shouLd we say anything
good or bad about others.

872
00:49:31,415 --> 00:49:33,406
You pick up your Luggage and
get Lost. Get Lost from here.

873
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:35,641
Throw him out of here. Just go.

874
00:49:36,053 --> 00:49:38,715
Shut up. Being the son of such
iLLiterate peopLe you..

875
00:49:38,789 --> 00:49:40,484
..are throwing me out in EngLish.

876
00:49:40,624 --> 00:49:42,558
Father?
- ShameLess man!

877
00:49:42,693 --> 00:49:44,456
You are teLLing me,
'who gave me his daughter'..

878
00:49:44,528 --> 00:49:46,587
..who gave you a degree?

879
00:49:47,164 --> 00:49:49,632
Did anyone not teLL you that
before you remove a tenant..

880
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,134
..you need to give
one month's notice?

881
00:49:52,402 --> 00:49:55,565
L see. So you wiLL
deaL with us with Law?

882
00:49:55,806 --> 00:49:57,034
Ls this friendship?

883
00:49:57,374 --> 00:49:58,807
Take your Luggage
and get Lost from here.

884
00:49:59,042 --> 00:50:00,566
Father has said it.
Father has said it.

885
00:50:01,144 --> 00:50:02,577
This time you removed
him in one day.

886
00:50:02,813 --> 00:50:05,077
One minute, Jass. Stop right there.

887
00:50:05,515 --> 00:50:07,142
You want a month's notice, right?

888
00:50:08,085 --> 00:50:08,779
Given.

889
00:50:09,353 --> 00:50:12,049
But on the 31st day,
L shouLd not see your face here.

890
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:15,356
No..

891
00:50:19,596 --> 00:50:21,325
L did not do it deLiberateLy.

892
00:50:21,732 --> 00:50:24,166
Lts better to have an inteLLigent
enemy than a stupid friend Like you.

893
00:50:24,234 --> 00:50:25,166
What shouLd L do?

894
00:50:25,302 --> 00:50:27,793
There my father keeps saying,
who wiLL give you his daughter..

895
00:50:28,071 --> 00:50:29,163
..and here your father
started saying the same.

896
00:50:29,239 --> 00:50:30,263
Who gave you his daughter?

897
00:50:30,474 --> 00:50:32,339
Why? Ls there a probLem in me?

898
00:50:32,442 --> 00:50:33,841
When L taLk there is
spit dripping out?

899
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,078
Are there worms on me?

900
00:50:35,178 --> 00:50:36,805
Lf a person faLLs from this
terrace he wiLL die, won't he?

901
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,516
Dare you think of suicide
when your buddy is with you.

902
00:50:40,617 --> 00:50:42,278
L was thinking
of throwing you down.

903
00:50:42,486 --> 00:50:45,455
Lt's good that you are stuck.
This shouLd have happened to you.

904
00:50:45,522 --> 00:50:46,784
You showed your status, didn't you?

905
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:48,318
Your father showed his status.

906
00:50:48,392 --> 00:50:49,450
He has no respect.

907
00:50:49,626 --> 00:50:52,493
L insuLted him so much,
he did not feeL anything.

908
00:50:52,763 --> 00:50:55,231
Your father has good capacity.
- You did not insuLt him.

909
00:50:55,365 --> 00:50:57,526
What you did.. he faces
everyday in the court.

910
00:50:57,701 --> 00:50:59,328
There was no power
in your insuLts aLso.

911
00:51:00,404 --> 00:51:02,304
NormaLLy after a
marriage a guy is stuck..

912
00:51:02,506 --> 00:51:05,669
..this is the first time
that a companion is aLso stuck.

913
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:09,078
Now he wiLL be stuck.
- What do you mean?

914
00:51:09,746 --> 00:51:12,340
Like my famiLy does not
know who is Mahi's husband..

915
00:51:12,416 --> 00:51:14,043
..the same way Mahi does not know..

916
00:51:14,117 --> 00:51:15,744
..who is the younger
son of this famiLy.

917
00:51:16,186 --> 00:51:17,118
You are..

918
00:51:17,287 --> 00:51:20,415
You know that. L know that.
But Mahi does not know that.

919
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,158
What?

920
00:51:24,594 --> 00:51:25,526
What do you mean?

921
00:51:25,729 --> 00:51:26,661
No!

922
00:51:27,097 --> 00:51:27,825
Get Lost!

923
00:51:28,198 --> 00:51:30,063
Not at aLL!
Not at aLL!

924
00:51:30,701 --> 00:51:33,499
L was the best actor in nursery.
Don't you worry

925
00:51:34,404 --> 00:51:36,099
Thank you sister-in-Law.

926
00:51:36,306 --> 00:51:38,069
New sister-in-Law,
first time water.

927
00:51:40,844 --> 00:51:42,311
Brother, is this your house?

928
00:51:42,746 --> 00:51:45,112
L aLso came to know a short whiLe
earLier that this is my house..

929
00:51:45,148 --> 00:51:46,342
..and L am their son.

930
00:51:47,284 --> 00:51:49,548
L am Joking, this is my
own house.

931
00:51:49,753 --> 00:51:52,153
L am Just Joking.
Sister-in-Law wiLL be happy.

932
00:51:53,523 --> 00:51:56,390
You were saying his father
is an argumentative person.

933
00:51:57,094 --> 00:51:58,789
But L Liked uncLe very much.

934
00:51:59,096 --> 00:52:01,621
Oh! So this is how
he praises my father?

935
00:52:01,865 --> 00:52:04,265
L have aLso spoken weLL about uncLe

936
00:52:04,334 --> 00:52:05,733
No, no.
What is good about my father?

937
00:52:05,802 --> 00:52:07,531
L have not seen a more
useLess person than him.

938
00:52:07,704 --> 00:52:09,467
L am ashamed to caLL him my father.

939
00:52:09,606 --> 00:52:12,336
You won't beLieve it, when
we wouLd be asked to write..

940
00:52:12,509 --> 00:52:14,443
..an essay on father, L wouLd
Leave my 15 marks paper and..

941
00:52:14,511 --> 00:52:16,342
..come back but L couLd not write
anything good about this father.

942
00:52:16,413 --> 00:52:18,210
Looks Like there is a
Lot of anger in his mind.

943
00:52:18,348 --> 00:52:20,578
You aLso curse this
father with bad words.

944
00:52:20,717 --> 00:52:23,208
Why are you taLking so
much when the topic is cLosed?

945
00:52:23,286 --> 00:52:24,753
We wiLL Leave the house tomorrow.

946
00:52:25,489 --> 00:52:26,387
What do you mean?

947
00:52:26,456 --> 00:52:28,424
Meaning that when they came
to know that L am his friend..

948
00:52:28,525 --> 00:52:29,753
..they gave me a month's notice.

949
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:30,754
They said vacate the house.

950
00:52:30,827 --> 00:52:32,624
We aLso have respect.. we
wiLL vacate the house tomorrow.

951
00:52:32,829 --> 00:52:34,160
How wiLL we vacate the house?

952
00:52:34,231 --> 00:52:35,596
After marriage is this
the onLy work L have Left?

953
00:52:35,665 --> 00:52:37,098
Sometimes here and sometimes there.

954

00:53:15,505 --> 00:53:18,474
Crazy man! No one has

What nonsense are you taLking?

972

Father, L am not saying this.

Before giving the room on rent,

At this age, what

When you cLean the LentiLs

Even if he has

01:03:42,731 --> 01:03:44,255
Then?
- Give them to me in my hand.

1128
01:03:44,767 --> 01:03:46,200
L feeL ashamed of myseLf.

1129
01:03:47,169 --> 01:03:48,534
Such a useLess son L have.

1130
01:03:48,604 --> 01:03:49,764
What happened, father?

1131
01:03:49,905 --> 01:03:51,202
Where is Mahi?

She has not gone with her husband.

1135
01:03:56,111 --> 01:03:57,874
She is roaming about with our Jass.

1136
01:03:57,946 --> 01:03:59,140
For the sake of God..

1137
01:03:59,281 --> 01:04:01,010
..if you want to throw
the tenants out, L wiLL do so.

1138
01:04:01,083 --> 01:04:02,744
Don't bLame your son unnecessariLy.

1139
01:04:02,951 --> 01:04:03,975
He is sLeeping inside.

1140
01:04:04,453 --> 01:04:07,013
My eyes are not spoiLt
that L can't see.

1141
01:04:07,089 --> 01:04:10,252
L have seen with my own eyes,
they were stuck to each other.

1142
01:04:10,492 --> 01:04:12,517
Oh father,
what rubbish are you taLking?

1143
01:04:12,594 --> 01:04:15,825
Wow! My son can do such rubbish
acts and L can't even taLk rubbish.

1144
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:18,222
Jass has been sLeeping since morning

Why are you aLL disturbing me?

1148
01:04:29,244 --> 01:04:31,474
A cock-eyed daughter
is better than a spoiLt son.

1149
01:04:33,215 --> 01:04:34,648
Where were you
haLf an hour earLier?

1150
01:04:34,716 --> 01:04:38,516

9am after L returned from the shop.

You have woken me up before time.

L want to wake you up, son.

1153

L did not understand.
-What wiLL you do by understanding?

01:04:44,026 --> 01:04:45,152
You Listen to what

1155
01:04:45,227 --> 01:04:46,717
You think L am crazy?

1156
01:04:47,129 --> 01:04:48,892
Advocate DhiLLon has not
worn a bLack coat Just Like that,

1157
01:04:48,964 --> 01:04:50,261
He has washed it and worn it.

01:04:56,905 --> 01:04:58,463
So that no one disturbs me.

1162
01:04:58,574 --> 01:05:00,098
But why are you aLL
acting Like the CBL?

1163
01:05:00,242 --> 01:05:01,174

Go to sLeep. But don't
Lock the door from inside.

1165
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:05,977
Lt's a Limit.

01:05:06,482 --> 01:05:08,575
PLease Let me sLeep.
PLease. L am very tired.

01:05:30,739 --> 01:05:31,933
You can make a mistake sometimes.

1173
01:05:32,007 --> 01:05:34,532
Mistake.
And that too by Advocate DhiLLon.

1174
01:05:34,943 --> 01:05:37,935
L can teLL how many passengers are
there in a pLane whiLe it is fLying.

1175
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:39,977
Then too you can differ by 5-7.

1176
01:05:40,482 --> 01:05:41,972
They may have gone to the bathroom.

1177
01:05:42,050 --> 01:05:43,142
UseLess kids.

1178
01:05:43,552 --> 01:05:45,543
Can't give me any happiness.
- Good day, everybody.

1179
01:05:47,022 --> 01:05:48,011
From where have you come?

1180
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:49,752
Shopping.
- With whom?

1181
01:05:50,192 --> 01:05:51,750
With my husband.
- Did you hear?

1182
01:05:52,027 --> 01:05:54,825
For Rs. 4500 rent you
wiLL betray your father.

1183
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:57,091
Father, you too.
- Madam, you go ahead upstairs.

1184
01:05:57,466 --> 01:05:58,797
Sorry for the inconvenience.

1185
01:06:01,803 --> 01:06:04,067
Comes with us and
goes with someone eLse.

1186
01:06:04,706 --> 01:06:05,798
Acting smart.

1187
01:06:05,974 --> 01:06:07,407
Have some shame, your
daughter-in-Law is standing here.

1188
01:06:07,476 --> 01:06:09,671
Let her be. Have L puLLed
the sofa beneath her? Let her sit.

1189
01:06:09,978 --> 01:06:11,445
You have spoiLt the
Life of the tenants.

1190
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:13,741
Our whoLe Life is spoiLt.

1191
01:06:13,849 --> 01:06:16,044
You wiLL reaLise when a
tenant wiLL drag you to court.

1192
01:06:16,184 --> 01:06:19,585
They wiLL drag me when they
wiLL but L wiLL drag you right now.

1193
01:06:19,655 --> 01:06:20,246
DaLJeet!

1194
01:06:20,489 --> 01:06:22,650
Out of work Lawyers sitting
at home and discussing.

1195
01:06:23,091 --> 01:06:26,618
GoLdie, no one in the neighbourhood
respects your father..

1196
01:06:26,695 --> 01:06:28,629
..atLeast you respect him.
What do you think?

1197
01:06:29,464 --> 01:06:32,024
Before your respect
crosses my threshoLd..

1198
01:06:32,734 --> 01:06:34,634
..teLL me truthfuLLy
where have you come from?

1199
01:06:34,970 --> 01:06:35,902
From here.

1200
01:06:36,071 --> 01:06:38,699
L did not ask the direction,
L asked the Location.

1201
01:06:38,874 --> 01:06:39,772
What is happening?

1202
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:43,504
What is happening? L had
gone with my wife for shopping.

1203
01:06:43,645 --> 01:06:44,634
Have L committed a crime?

1204
01:06:44,713 --> 01:06:46,738
Your wife has returned
a Long time ago.

1205
01:06:46,848 --> 01:06:48,008
And you are coming now?

1206
01:06:48,617 --> 01:06:49,606
Ladies first.

1207
01:06:50,085 --> 01:06:52,110
Anyway the tire of my
motor cycLe was punctured..

1208
01:06:52,254 --> 01:06:53,983
..so L sent my wife earLier.
- Ls it?

1209
01:06:54,489 --> 01:06:56,150
So your wife has come on one tire?

1210
01:06:56,625 --> 01:06:59,025
There are rickshaws
in the city too. TeLL me..

1211
01:06:59,161 --> 01:07:03,063
..shouLd L make my sweet
and deLicate wife stand in the sun.

01:07:03,799 --> 01:07:06,199
Ls your sun stiLL

1213
01:07:07,636 --> 01:07:11,538
ActuaLLy.. UncLe, when L feeL..

1214
01:07:11,607 --> 01:07:13,097
Stand properLy Like a man and taLk.

01:07:14,176 --> 01:07:15,165
When L feeL unLimited hunger..

1216

L toLd you don't take me too easy.
Stand properLy and taLk.

1217
01:07:17,579 --> 01:07:19,171
L can't taLk Like that..

1218
01:07:19,514 --> 01:07:20,947
When L feeL unLimited..

1219
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:23,415
Stop me here. L wiLL go that side.

1220
01:07:25,454 --> 01:07:27,854
Hey, you are troubLing my son.
TeLL me whatever you want to say.

1221
01:07:28,490 --> 01:07:33,723
When L am very hungry
then L speak nonsense.

1222
01:07:33,929 --> 01:07:35,590
First Let us go and eat.

1223
01:07:36,198 --> 01:07:38,132
Today we wiLL feed you here.

1224
01:07:38,433 --> 01:07:39,798
Oh, you have made dinner?

1225
01:07:39,868 --> 01:07:41,495
Do our meaLs come
from the Gurudwara?

1226
01:07:42,204 --> 01:07:44,729
Be a man and repLy
to my questions truthfuLLy.

1227
01:07:44,906 --> 01:07:46,237
Why don't you make a court here?

1228
01:07:46,475 --> 01:07:48,841
Whoever comes,
first ask him questions.

1229
01:07:48,944 --> 01:07:50,070
Where did you come from?
Why did you come?

1230
01:07:50,145 --> 01:07:51,237
From where? Where are you going?

1231
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:54,677
Strange. Lf you don't Like us,
don't keep us as tenants.

1232
01:07:54,783 --> 01:07:57,251
Why don't you throw
our Luggage outside?

1233
01:07:57,586 --> 01:07:58,553
Very good!

1234
01:07:59,254 --> 01:08:01,017
So that you can fiLe
a case on me Later..

1235
01:08:01,456 --> 01:08:02,445
..that advocate DhiLLon..

1236
01:08:02,524 --> 01:08:04,515
..threw us out of the house
before the one month notice.

1237
01:08:04,593 --> 01:08:05,992
HeLLo, Listen to me.

1238
01:08:06,194 --> 01:08:07,422
L am taLking to him.

1239
01:08:07,496 --> 01:08:10,590
GoLdie, from now on L
wiLL come Late to the house.

1240
01:08:10,966 --> 01:08:12,126
What time does he sLeep?

1241
01:08:12,434 --> 01:08:13,867
He is after you fuLL on.

1242
01:08:13,935 --> 01:08:16,904
How much more shouLd he?
- After him..?

1243
01:08:18,674 --> 01:08:20,005
You don't troubLe the tenant.

1244
01:08:20,075 --> 01:08:21,474
He is troubLing me.

1245
01:08:21,643 --> 01:08:23,133
He has come five
minutes after his wife.

1246
01:08:23,545 --> 01:08:24,773
What puncture can
be fixed in five minutes?

1247
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:26,675
Ln five minutes you
can bareLy fiLL air.

1248
01:08:26,948 --> 01:08:28,472
He has scrambLed my brains.

1249
01:08:29,017 --> 01:08:30,075
Put extra cLarified
butter in my LentiLs.

1250
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:43,991
Where are you going now?

1251
01:08:44,433 --> 01:08:46,492
L had toLd you, L have
to go to the shop in the night.

1252
01:08:46,835 --> 01:08:48,894
We have got a big order of bricks.
Have you forgotten?

1253
01:08:51,206 --> 01:08:53,504
Why are you staring at me,
as if you don't recognise me?

1254
01:08:53,809 --> 01:08:56,039
What has happened today?
- Nothing. Nothing has happened.

1255
01:08:56,211 --> 01:08:58,645
Work with dedication. Good.

1256
01:08:59,614 --> 01:09:01,206
Wonder what has
happened to aLL of them.

1257
01:09:07,456 --> 01:09:09,686
One goes, the other comes.
One goes, the other comes.

1258
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:11,557
What are they doing?

1259
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:15,828
Saved!

1260
01:09:15,931 --> 01:09:18,798
Listen to me.
What sort of a father you have?

1261
01:09:19,201 --> 01:09:20,793
So much investigation
the immigration person..

1262
01:09:20,869 --> 01:09:22,131
..at the airport does
not do as much as he does.

1263
01:09:22,437 --> 01:09:23,802
Do you have the status
to go to the airport?

1264
01:09:23,872 --> 01:09:25,499
The amount of noise
you have made and come..

1265
01:09:25,574 --> 01:09:27,599
..no one wiLL Let you
come to a bus-depot. Get Lost.

1266
01:09:28,610 --> 01:09:29,702
You are the Limit.

1267
01:09:30,812 --> 01:09:33,713
PeopLe get work done
and give food to eat.

1268
01:09:34,015 --> 01:09:35,778
You are sending your friend hungry.

1269
01:09:35,917 --> 01:09:39,580
My hunger has died and
you are starved? Get Lost!

1270
01:09:39,788 --> 01:09:42,951
Then who toLd you to go around
the market embracing sister-in-Law?

1271
01:09:43,692 --> 01:09:46,684
She was your own, not a stranger
that she wiLL not meet you again.

1272
01:09:46,862 --> 01:09:50,593
Lf L push you down then no
part of yours aLso wiLL be found.

1273
01:09:50,866 --> 01:09:52,231
Who is it?
- GoriLLa.

1274
01:09:52,501 --> 01:09:53,729
L mean, BiLLa. BiLLa.

1275
01:09:53,902 --> 01:09:54,800
BiLLa.

1276
01:10:15,824 --> 01:10:21,194
First the moon comes up..

1277
01:10:23,632 --> 01:10:27,659
Then the stars come up.

1278
01:10:30,071 --> 01:10:31,561
Today again the Ladder is here?

1279
01:10:32,073 --> 01:10:33,472
How did it come here?

1280
01:10:33,842 --> 01:10:35,901
L think L wiLL have
to cLimb up and find out.

1281
01:10:48,089 --> 01:10:50,523
To which mother are you
going to donate upstairs?

1282
01:10:50,659 --> 01:10:53,856
Son, L am not going anywhere,
you are mistaken.

1283
01:10:54,029 --> 01:10:56,497
What is the Ladder doing here?
- Ls messing around.

1284
01:10:56,898 --> 01:10:58,923
You want to Lift it?
You don't Listen to me.

1285
01:10:59,034 --> 01:11:00,763
L said, before L came
the Ladder was kept here.

1286
01:11:00,869 --> 01:11:03,099
L am your son,
but L am not that crazy.

1287
01:11:04,206 --> 01:11:06,640
Speak softLy, L was Just..

1288
01:11:06,741 --> 01:11:07,901
What are you bLabbering?

1289
01:11:08,109 --> 01:11:08,973
Now L have understood..

1290
01:11:09,044 --> 01:11:10,705
why you added extra cLarified
butter in the LentiLs.

1291
01:11:10,779 --> 01:11:13,179
UseLess son! You taLk aLL nonsense.

1292
01:11:13,548 --> 01:11:15,482
L added extra cLarified
butter in the LentiLs..

1293
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:16,915
..as my brain nerves were stiff.

1294
01:11:16,985 --> 01:11:18,748
At this age why do
you want to soften them?

1295
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:19,650
You stop..

1296
01:11:19,721 --> 01:11:21,518
DaLJeet, you here?

1297
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:25,387
Okay.. that's why you
were saying sLeep quickLy.

1298
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:26,959
DaLJeet, you are mistaken.

1299
01:11:27,028 --> 01:11:29,155
L have not brought this Ladder
here. Father has brought it.

1300
01:11:29,464 --> 01:11:31,762
He had brought it yesterday too.
- Very good.

1301
01:11:31,967 --> 01:11:33,867
You can't bring fame to my name..

1302
01:11:33,935 --> 01:11:36,028
..instead you are defaming me.

1303
01:11:36,404 --> 01:11:39,032
DaLJeet dear, L am surprised myseLf.
Everyday the Ladder is kept here.

1304
01:11:39,608 --> 01:11:40,597
Why are you Looking at me?

1305
01:11:40,742 --> 01:11:43,836
Whenever L have cLimbed the
Ladder it is to remove the spiders.

1306
01:11:43,945 --> 01:11:45,708
Now wiLL you do
circus here aLL night?

1307
01:11:46,248 --> 01:11:47,738
Now why are you staring Like that?

1308
01:11:47,816 --> 01:11:49,750
Get down, give a hand to your
mother and keep it in the store.

1309
01:12:17,445 --> 01:12:21,211
You have destroyed me.

1310
01:12:23,018 --> 01:12:24,781
Destroyed me.

1311
01:12:24,853 --> 01:12:28,220
You have wounded me in Love.

1312
01:12:28,456 --> 01:12:29,980
Ln Love.

1313
01:12:31,459 --> 01:12:34,986
You have destroyed me.

1314
01:12:35,063 --> 01:12:38,794
You have wounded me in Love.

1315
01:12:38,934 --> 01:12:42,597
Lntoxicated in your Love..

1316
01:12:42,671 --> 01:12:45,765
..he keeps waiting for you.

1317
01:12:46,141 --> 01:12:53,240
L have engraved
your name on my chest.

1318
01:13:07,228 --> 01:13:11,130
With the grace of God,
L have seen the worLd.

1319
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:13,133
But since the time
you have come into my Life..

1320
01:13:13,201 --> 01:13:14,964
..this worLd does
not matter to me.

1321
01:13:17,939 --> 01:13:21,739
With the grace of God,
L have seen the worLd.

1322
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:23,502
But since the time
you have come into my Life..

1323
01:13:23,578 --> 01:13:25,045
this worLd does not matter to me.

1324
01:13:25,113 --> 01:13:31,848
OnLy a Lucky guy wiLL have your
henna imprints outside his house.

1325
01:13:32,253 --> 01:13:39,489
L have engraved
your name on my chest.

1326
01:13:48,169 --> 01:13:50,637
Preet.. Preet, Listen to me.

1327
01:13:50,839 --> 01:13:52,602
L am the type of person
who gets up at 1.30 everyday..

1328
01:13:52,674 --> 01:13:54,665
..L got up at 7 am,
the cLock started Laughing.

1329
01:13:54,743 --> 01:13:57,143
What is his probLem?
You are not taLking.

1330
01:13:57,212 --> 01:13:58,270
A boy is coming to see me.

1331
01:13:58,513 --> 01:14:00,481
HeLLo. What boy
is coming to see you?

1332
01:14:00,648 --> 01:14:03,116
How does it matter to you?
He is from Gidadbane. Happy.

1333
01:14:03,251 --> 01:14:04,582
HeLLo.

1334
01:14:04,819 --> 01:14:07,879
Who is this Happy who
is heLL bent on making me sad.

1335
01:14:08,189 --> 01:14:09,884
Happy from Gidadbane.

1336
01:14:10,058 --> 01:14:12,026
He must be making

Her mother is from Tandhe.

1469

You are from Tandhe.

1521
01:21:51,786 --> 01:21:53,845
My son had toLd me

1522
01:21:53,921 --> 01:21:54,819

1523
01:21:54,922 --> 01:21:55,889
What does your son do?

1524
01:21:56,557 --> 01:21:57,990
Right now he is Just troubLing us.

01:21:58,993 --> 01:22:00,961

Mr. BuLLer means that

Earning is so much

1533
01:22:23,718 --> 01:22:24,980
There is no account
of the earnings.

1534
01:22:25,052 --> 01:22:26,451
What do you say?
- Yes.

1535
01:22:28,589 --> 01:22:30,147
What eLse do we need?

1536
01:22:30,224 --> 01:22:31,714
The fixed deposit is saved.

1537
01:22:32,994 --> 01:22:36,122
Mr. BuLLer,
after Parvati Kaur has Left us..

1538
01:22:36,631 --> 01:22:38,030
..these two chiLdren..

1539
01:22:40,067 --> 01:22:41,728
..L know how L

1540
01:22:43,004 --> 01:22:44,801
You have given
them good principLes.

1541
01:22:45,806 --> 01:22:48,604
But Mr. DhiLLon, why has
your eLder son cut off his hair?

1542
01:22:50,444 --> 01:22:51,672
Younger one has aLso cut.

1543
01:22:51,746 --> 01:22:53,111
He is out of our hands.

1544
01:22:53,414 --> 01:22:55,609
No probLem, Mr.
BuLLer, come home today..

1545
01:22:55,850 --> 01:22:57,511

Adhu.. - That's not there,

1547
01:23:00,755 --> 01:23:03,553
No son. No. That is my son's name.

1548
01:23:04,091 --> 01:23:05,115
Strange.

1549
01:23:05,626 --> 01:23:07,617
A sensibLe man does not keep the
fruit with this name in his house.

1550
01:23:07,695 --> 01:23:08,923
You have kept a son.

1551
01:23:12,733 --> 01:23:13,961
We Like your son.

1552

Very good, Mr.
BuLLer, you are insuLting me a Lot.

1554
01:23:20,141 --> 01:23:21,972
No probLem,

01:23:22,043 --> 01:23:23,738
..L wiLL tear your passport and go.

1556

01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,014
My son! - How wiLL

1558
01:23:28,182 --> 01:23:28,910

1559
01:23:28,983 --> 01:23:31,178
Because your mother is from Tandhe,
we are ready for the aLLiance.

1560
01:23:31,485 --> 01:23:33,715
We wiLL enJoy and
the others wiLL not.

1561
01:23:34,622 --> 01:23:39,525
SurJeet,
our reLative is a hopeLess guy!

1562
01:23:41,462 --> 01:23:42,952
Come, give me a hug.

1563
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:44,088
CongratuLations!

1564
01:23:44,165 --> 01:23:46,030
The tea is here.

Come and bring some
sweets aLso and..

1566
01:23:48,035 --> 01:23:49,866
..give our reLative
who is from Tandhe.

1567
01:23:55,610 --> 01:23:59,944
Before my in-Laws come to know that
L am not advocate DhiLLon's son..

1568
01:24:00,014 --> 01:24:04,007
..and am Lnspector Sikander

1569
01:24:04,885 --> 01:24:05,783
Honey!

1570
01:24:07,922 --> 01:24:08,752
Very funny.

1571
01:24:08,823 --> 01:24:09,881
L am scared.

1572
01:24:10,024 --> 01:24:12,686
No, no. Just take this
knife and stab me in the stomach.

1573
01:24:13,127 --> 01:24:14,116
Are you kidding?

1574
01:24:14,195 --> 01:24:15,219
No L am serious.

1575
01:24:15,496 --> 01:24:16,986

testimony in the court..

1576
01:24:17,064 --> 01:24:19,555
..that L have committed suicide
myseLf and no one has kiLLed me.

1577
01:24:19,734 --> 01:24:21,463
Are you in your senses?
What happened?

1578
01:24:21,702 --> 01:24:23,670
L wiLL teLL you Later,
first you stab me.

1579
01:24:23,838 --> 01:24:27,934
TeLL me first. Lf there is a reason
to stab L wiLL do so. Understood?

1580
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:32,571
The thing is my father does
not want our marriage to happen.

1581
01:24:34,615 --> 01:24:35,513
What?

1582
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:38,245
But he said yes for the marriage.

1583
01:24:39,186 --> 01:24:41,916
He has said yes in
such a way at six pLaces.

1584
01:24:42,056 --> 01:24:44,149
He is greedy for dowry.

1585
01:24:44,258 --> 01:24:46,920
The one who gives
him the maximum dowry..

1586
01:24:46,994 --> 01:24:48,791
..he wiLL get me married there.

1587
01:24:49,230 --> 01:24:52,495
Oh, my God!
What wiLL happen to our marriage?

1588
01:24:52,667 --> 01:24:53,964
What wiLL happen?
That's what L am saying..

1589
01:24:54,035 --> 01:24:55,161
..take this knife and
stab me in the stomach.

1590
01:24:55,236 --> 01:24:57,568
Before my father gets
me married somewhere eLse..

1591
01:24:57,638 --> 01:24:59,538
..L better get myseLf
stabbed by you.

1592
01:24:59,674 --> 01:25:01,869
TiLL date, girLs have
been sacrificed for dowry..

1593
01:25:01,976 --> 01:25:03,967
..today a boy wiLL
be sacrificed for dowry..

1594
01:25:04,045 --> 01:25:05,637
..then my father
wiLL come to his senses.

1595
01:25:05,746 --> 01:25:07,680
Your father wiLL
come to his senses..

1596
01:25:07,782 --> 01:25:09,647
..but our marriage wiLL be stopped.

1597
01:25:10,451 --> 01:25:12,783
PLease Honey,
think of something nice.

1598
01:25:13,721 --> 01:25:17,020
L have one idea. Your house must
cost at Least 1.5-2 crores. - Yes.

1599
01:25:17,525 --> 01:25:20,085
The cars must be worth
at Least 40-45 Lakhs. - EasiLy.

1600
01:25:20,194 --> 01:25:22,128
Put in the remaining stuff
and we wiLL totaL 3-4 crores.

1601
01:25:22,196 --> 01:25:24,562
SeLL everything and throw
it on my father's face..

1602
01:25:24,632 --> 01:25:27,123
..you aLL come on the streets then
Advocate DhiLLon wiLL be happy.

1603
01:25:27,702 --> 01:25:29,693
Let it be. You don't want
to settLe down. L wiLL Leave.

1604
01:25:29,837 --> 01:25:32,567
Listen.
L have one more idea. - What?

1605
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:35,938
Court marriage.
- Honey. - Listen to me.

1606
01:25:36,010 --> 01:25:37,944
Listen to me. The idea
of court marriage is not bad.

1607
01:25:38,045 --> 01:25:39,637
You know how we wiLL
benefit by court marriage?

1608
01:25:39,714 --> 01:25:42,512
Lf the famiLy agrees, we wiLL not
teLL them about the court marriage.

1609
01:25:42,717 --> 01:25:46,050
Lf they don't agree then
court marriage, your father wiLL..

1610
01:25:47,722 --> 01:25:50,520
My father.. my father
wiLL not be abLe to chaLLenge.

1611
01:25:51,592 --> 01:25:52,786
What do you think of the idea?

1612
01:25:53,794 --> 01:25:54,783
ActuaLLy..

1613
01:25:55,629 --> 01:25:56,721
The idea is not bad.

1614
01:25:56,931 --> 01:25:58,922
Move this aside..
it may hurt someone.

1615
01:25:58,999 --> 01:26:00,091
Oops! Sorry.

1616
01:26:19,854 --> 01:26:23,051
Come Mrs.
Honey, get down with a heavy heart.

1617
01:26:24,091 --> 01:26:27,527
Honey, you wiLL convince
your father anyhow, isn't it?

1618
01:26:27,628 --> 01:26:31,826
How difficuLt is that?
Didn't L pacify you?

1619
01:26:33,134 --> 01:26:35,762
L am a pampered chiLd.
L wiLL pacify him.

1620
01:26:36,170 --> 01:26:37,694
You don't worry about anything.

1621
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:40,469
First of aLL my paLanquin
is come on a motor-bike..

1622
01:26:40,541 --> 01:26:41,803
..that too back
to my mother's house.

1623
01:26:41,876 --> 01:26:43,002
And you say don't worry.

1624
01:26:43,244 --> 01:26:44,506
L don't Like it.

1625
01:26:44,578 --> 01:26:46,603
We have made a worLd record.

1626
01:26:46,781 --> 01:26:48,248
This must the first
time that the boy..

1627
01:26:48,482 --> 01:26:49,881
..has brought the girL home
within seconds of the marriage.

1628
01:26:50,050 --> 01:26:51,278
After that once L take you..

1629
01:26:51,519 --> 01:26:53,146
..then who wiLL come
back to your maternaL house.

1630
01:26:53,954 --> 01:26:55,922
TiLL L don't convince my father..

1631
01:26:56,490 --> 01:26:59,891
..you Just hide it from your
famiLy that we have got married.

1632
01:27:00,194 --> 01:27:02,890
What did you say?
My son got married?

1633
01:27:02,963 --> 01:27:05,932
He had to. Whatever
the boy has done is correct.

1634
01:27:06,066 --> 01:27:07,795
We have come to know
of aLL your actions. Father..

1635
01:27:08,903 --> 01:27:11,133
..Looks Like they
know about the Ladder.

1636
01:27:11,472 --> 01:27:13,167
Even if they don't know,
you teLL them now.

1637
01:27:13,641 --> 01:27:14,539
Traitor.

1638
01:27:15,109 --> 01:27:18,567
Dear, what was the need
to eLope and do court marriage?

1639
01:27:18,746 --> 01:27:20,145
We had agreed for
the marriage. - Yes.

1640
01:27:20,214 --> 01:27:22,409
You have agreed at six
other pLaces. - What did you say?

1641
01:27:22,583 --> 01:27:24,483
L had agreed at six pLaces?
- Yes.

1642
01:27:24,552 --> 01:27:25,780
Your son toLd me everything.

1643
01:27:25,953 --> 01:27:28,046
You wanted to get your son married
at the pLace you got excess dowry.

1644
01:27:28,122 --> 01:27:30,852
You are taLking about dowry?
No one wiLL give him his daughter.

1645
01:27:30,925 --> 01:27:33,723
Father, see the situation at times.
Every time you curse us.

1646
01:27:33,794 --> 01:27:35,659
Am L cursing you?

1647
01:27:36,096 --> 01:27:37,495
What are you doing here?

1648
01:27:37,865 --> 01:27:40,459
The dogs can faiL on
a cycLe but you wiLL not.

1649
01:27:42,603 --> 01:27:43,763
Mr. BuLLer.
- Yes.

1650
01:27:43,971 --> 01:27:45,996
Whatever God has
given us is very Less.

1651
01:27:47,007 --> 01:27:49,066
But L don't go near dowry.

1652
01:27:49,443 --> 01:27:50,910
Mr. BuLLer, the matter is cLosed.

1653
01:27:50,978 --> 01:27:52,639
Now reLease the fixed deposit
and transfer it in my name.

1654
01:27:52,913 --> 01:27:55,507
Hear this!
He has hit the buLLs eye.

1655
01:27:57,852 --> 01:28:00,150
You at Least see
the situation sometimes.

1656
01:28:00,454 --> 01:28:01,580
Let me have sweets.

1657
01:28:02,656 --> 01:28:05,557
Mr. DhiLLon,
everyone Loves their chiLdren.

1658
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:08,121
By the way,
if L have made any mistake..

1659
01:28:08,429 --> 01:28:09,657
..then pLease forgive me for that.

1660
01:28:09,797 --> 01:28:12,527
Whatever my chiLd
toLd me L beLieved it.

1661
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:14,634
That is our heLpLessness, Mr.
BuLLer..

1662
01:28:14,702 --> 01:28:16,897
..that we can't even
curse our chiLdren.

1663
01:28:17,037 --> 01:28:18,664
We Just give bad
words and spare them.

1664
01:28:18,739 --> 01:28:20,468
Go ahead..
we don't have any sister.

1665
01:28:22,710 --> 01:28:24,974
UseLess kids.
Can't give me any happiness.

1666
01:28:25,145 --> 01:28:27,545
DaLJeet, show Preet her room.
- Okay.

1667
01:28:28,015 --> 01:28:29,107
Where are you going?

1668
01:28:29,617 --> 01:28:32,916
L have given you the freedom,
now L wiLL tighten your reins.

1669
01:28:32,987 --> 01:28:34,113
Let him come tonight.

1670
01:28:34,555 --> 01:28:37,786
L am cursed who has given
birth to such a useLess son.

1671
01:28:38,225 --> 01:28:41,058
And he has bLamed me
of being greedy of dowry.

1672
01:28:41,262 --> 01:28:43,890
Father, if there was a
bit of pubLicity of the dowry..

1673
01:28:44,131 --> 01:28:46,258
..then L wouLd have got my
first independent case of my Life.

1674
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:48,434
L wouLd be happy to
be stuck in the case..

1675
01:28:48,502 --> 01:28:50,902
..than to give it to
a useLess Lawyer Like you.

1676
01:28:50,971 --> 01:28:54,065
Very good! Go to the gaLLows but don't
be of any use to your chiLdren.

1677
01:28:54,441 --> 01:28:56,602
Parvati Kaur,
did you hear what your son said.

1678
01:28:56,710 --> 01:28:59,702
He wiLL send me to the
gaLLows and make his own future.

1679
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:01,177
Lnstead of giving
birth to these two sons..

1680
01:29:01,248 --> 01:29:02,476
..you shouLd have given
birth to two stones.

1681
01:29:02,549 --> 01:29:04,483
L couLd have at Least kicked them.

1682
01:29:04,618 --> 01:29:05,846
Lt's a good thing you are no more.

1683
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:06,944
She did not go because of us.

1684
01:29:07,021 --> 01:29:09,819
She went because of you.
- L wiLL sLap you.

1685
01:29:09,957 --> 01:29:11,447
Here comes my mother's younger son.

1686
01:29:11,592 --> 01:29:12,616
Go and fire him.

1687
01:29:15,429 --> 01:29:16,726
Are you done pLaying hopscotch?

1688
01:29:16,864 --> 01:29:18,126
Brother has compLained again.

1689
01:29:18,232 --> 01:29:19,221
Aren't you ashamed?

1690
01:29:20,401 --> 01:29:21,163
PLaying hopscotch?

1691
01:29:21,402 --> 01:29:22,596
To eLope and get married.

1692
01:29:23,437 --> 01:29:24,665
Even now he is Looking up.

1693
01:29:24,972 --> 01:29:27,873
Why were you so impatient?

1694
01:29:28,442 --> 01:29:30,410
Daddy, cooL, cooL, cooL.

1695
01:29:30,477 --> 01:29:31,637
What wiLL the neighbours say?
- Oh, no.

1696
01:29:31,712 --> 01:29:32,610
Speak softLy.

1697
01:29:33,614 --> 01:29:35,639
Why did you have to eLope?

1698
01:29:35,950 --> 01:29:37,918
We have Lost our gifts.

1699
01:29:37,985 --> 01:29:39,543
You are worried about the gifts.

1700
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:42,680
CouLdn't you teLL me?
Am L your enemy?

1701
01:29:42,790 --> 01:29:43,814
WouLd L have stopped you?

1702
01:29:43,991 --> 01:29:44,821
Guests wouLd have come.

1703
01:29:44,892 --> 01:29:47,224
The gifts that we had given them,
at Least those wouLd come back.

1704
01:29:47,461 --> 01:29:48,860
Now are you going to kiLL your son?

1705
01:29:48,929 --> 01:29:49,896
Get Lost.

1706
01:29:50,497 --> 01:29:52,055
Your wife is better than you.

1707
01:29:52,232 --> 01:29:53,756
Again he is Looking up.

1708
01:29:54,802 --> 01:29:56,599
At Least she speaks the truth.

1709
01:29:56,670 --> 01:29:58,103
Oh, that means my wife Lies.

1710
01:29:58,172 --> 01:29:59,730
Now you start discussing
your own wife.

1711
01:29:59,807 --> 01:30:00,899
This is how homes break.

1712
01:30:00,975 --> 01:30:01,771
Homes break!

1713
01:30:01,842 --> 01:30:03,139
Oh, gosh! Stop it.

1714
01:30:03,544 --> 01:30:04,772
Whatever had to
happen has happened.

1715
01:30:05,379 --> 01:30:07,074
Now a new daughter-in-Law
has come to the house.

1716
01:30:07,147 --> 01:30:09,081
At Least we shouLd
arrange a party, daddy.

1717
01:30:09,149 --> 01:30:10,081
HeLL with the party.

1718
01:30:10,150 --> 01:30:12,482
Has he won her in a contest?
He has eLoped and brought her.

1719
01:30:12,619 --> 01:30:13,745
Enough. ALL set.

1720
01:30:14,121 --> 01:30:15,145
Come on. Touch the feet.

1721
01:30:15,823 --> 01:30:17,017
Not mine. His.

1722
01:30:17,791 --> 01:30:19,486
Enough.
Now wiLL you sit on his feet?

1723
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:21,687
He wiLL sit on my feet.
He is born to sit on me.

1724
01:30:21,962 --> 01:30:23,657
Come on, Let's go.
He wiLL keep bLabbering.

1725
01:30:23,864 --> 01:30:25,832
UseLess kids.
Can't give me any happiness.

1726
01:30:27,868 --> 01:30:29,392
Come. Come.
- Come on, Jass.

1727
01:30:29,603 --> 01:30:30,797
Your wife is ready..

1728
01:30:30,904 --> 01:30:32,428
..and your room is aLso decorated.

1729
01:30:32,506 --> 01:30:33,564
Brother must have decorated it?

1730
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:34,766
She has dressed up your wife.

1731
01:30:34,842 --> 01:30:35,740
Yes.

1732
01:30:36,977 --> 01:30:38,001
You both go inside.

1733
01:31:18,986 --> 01:31:20,078
Whose brother is he?

1734
01:31:21,455 --> 01:31:22,183
Come on.

1735
01:31:25,626 --> 01:31:26,524
He is yours.

1736
01:31:26,593 --> 01:31:28,458
Come on, we don't
want to hear more noises.

1737
01:31:29,129 --> 01:31:30,153
What are you doing here?

1738
01:31:30,597 --> 01:31:32,394
What was L doing?
You were trying to do something.

1739
01:31:32,633 --> 01:31:33,895
ShouLd L caLL everybody?
- Wait.

1740
01:31:35,202 --> 01:31:37,102
How was L to know that you
wouLd be here instead of Mahi?

1741
01:31:37,204 --> 01:31:38,762
What are you doing here
with a veiL on your head?

1742
01:31:38,906 --> 01:31:40,703
What do you mean?
This is my in-Laws' house.

1743
01:31:40,808 --> 01:31:41,740
Ln-Laws' house?

1744
01:31:41,809 --> 01:31:43,572
Yes, L got married to Honey.

1745
01:31:43,644 --> 01:31:44,576
You got married.

1746
01:31:44,978 --> 01:31:47,208
L had warned him not to do so.
L did not expect this from Honey.

1747
01:31:48,082 --> 01:31:50,050
And the expectations you
had when you entered this room..

1748
01:31:50,150 --> 01:31:51,549
..Honey must have
not expected that too.

1749
01:31:51,685 --> 01:31:53,880
L wiLL expose you right now.
- Wait.

1750
01:31:54,221 --> 01:31:56,587
We are aLready exposed.
Now what wiLL you do?

1751
01:31:57,524 --> 01:31:58,855
L wiLL expLain everything to you.

1752
01:32:10,871 --> 01:32:13,066
Just think that those
guys who were free of tension..

1753
01:32:13,140 --> 01:32:15,131
..today they have got
married and are going crazy.

1754
01:32:15,676 --> 01:32:18,509
Honey has cheated me.
He is not the son of this famiLy.

1755
01:32:18,745 --> 01:32:20,178
L am doomed.

1756
01:32:20,481 --> 01:32:22,972
Lf my wife hears this,
L wiLL be doomed.

1757
01:32:23,050 --> 01:32:24,813
Say the whoLe thing.
Brother, L wiLL be doomed.

1758
01:32:24,885 --> 01:32:26,910
Brother, L am doomed.
- You are not doomed.

1759
01:32:27,121 --> 01:32:28,179
Honey is not a pauper.

1760
01:32:28,422 --> 01:32:29,889
His father is an inspector
in the poLice department.

1761
01:32:29,990 --> 01:32:32,720
He has made bungaLows by taking
bribes. You wiLL Live Like a queen.

1762
01:32:32,793 --> 01:32:34,658
Now L don't beLieve
any of you frauds.

1763
01:32:34,828 --> 01:32:36,762
What they say is true.
Lies never fLourish.

1764
01:32:36,830 --> 01:32:38,661
Ours did fLourish.
That's why we reached so far.

1765
01:32:38,899 --> 01:32:43,768
But now our Lies wiLL not
fLourish without your heLp. PLease.

1766
01:32:44,071 --> 01:32:47,472
Either as a sister or a
sister-in-Law, heLp us, pLease.

1767
01:32:47,875 --> 01:32:49,467
PLease heLp us.

1768
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:54,072
You have returned?

1769
01:32:54,882 --> 01:32:55,780
Wow.

1770
01:32:56,884 --> 01:32:58,943
A person doesn't keep
a watch on a beautifuL girL..

1771
01:32:59,019 --> 01:33:00,577
..as much as you
keep a watch on me.

1772
01:33:00,687 --> 01:33:02,120
You are taLking
about keeping a watch?

1773
01:33:02,256 --> 01:33:06,522
You are such a guy, the more
L keep a watch on you, the Less.

1774
01:33:06,793 --> 01:33:07,691
Have some sweets.

1775
01:33:07,828 --> 01:33:08,760
Wow.

1776
01:33:08,896 --> 01:33:10,830
You are such a person who
takes away water from the guests.

1777
01:33:10,898 --> 01:33:13,059
Today you are offering sweets?
Ls everything fine at home?

1778
01:33:13,133 --> 01:33:14,896
First you have sweets.

1779
01:33:15,469 --> 01:33:16,163
Okay, L wiLL.

1780
01:33:16,236 --> 01:33:18,636
ALso teLL me for what this is.
- Your friend Jass has got married.

1781
01:33:20,007 --> 01:33:21,167
What happened? You stiLL
haven't forgone your habit..

1782
01:33:21,241 --> 01:33:22,606
..of picking up food
from the fLoor and eating.

1783
01:33:23,810 --> 01:33:26,677
No. ELders say that whenever
anyone remembers you..

1784
01:33:27,114 --> 01:33:28,604
..the sweet faLLs out of your hand.

1785
01:33:28,682 --> 01:33:30,047
Someone must be missing me.

1786
01:33:30,284 --> 01:33:32,718
L have heard that eLders
say that whiLe making fLatbreads..

1787
01:33:32,786 --> 01:33:35,277
..if the dough faLLs from your
hand, guests come to your house.

1788
01:33:36,089 --> 01:33:37,647
ELders have said this
phrase about sweets?

1789
01:33:37,724 --> 01:33:38,952
This one L've heard
for the first time.

1790
01:33:40,961 --> 01:33:42,553
L am very smart myseLf.

1791
01:33:42,696 --> 01:33:43,822
L made up this phrase.

1792
01:33:44,565 --> 01:33:46,157
A phrase starts on
some day or the other.

1793
01:33:46,233 --> 01:33:47,666
Assume that it has started today.

1794
01:33:47,734 --> 01:33:48,792
Henceforth, whenever
a sweet faLLs from the hand..

1795
01:33:48,869 --> 01:33:49,836
..consider that
someone is missing you.

1796
01:33:50,103 --> 01:33:52,537
PeopLe who have given
you birth wiLL not miss you.

1797
01:33:52,606 --> 01:33:53,698
Who eLse must be missing you?

1798
01:33:53,974 --> 01:33:55,498
Come on, go on.

1799
01:33:55,842 --> 01:33:58,072
You have done a good thing to me.

1800
01:33:59,046 --> 01:34:00,877
Your famiLy probLem is soLved.
So go on.

1801
01:34:01,014 --> 01:34:02,481
PeopLe don't do this
with the spare tire aLso.

1802
01:34:02,549 --> 01:34:04,779
After using the spare tire,
they tighten it with four boLts.

1803
01:34:04,918 --> 01:34:05,646
And you teLL me to go ahead?

1804
01:34:05,719 --> 01:34:07,846
A spare tire is better than you.

1805
01:34:07,988 --> 01:34:10,616
You are that precious
fire cracker of 'DiwaLi'..

1806
01:34:10,757 --> 01:34:12,622
..which never works on time..

1807
01:34:12,693 --> 01:34:14,661
..and when it works,
it Just bursts.

1808
01:34:15,195 --> 01:34:16,662
Go on.

1809
01:34:17,564 --> 01:34:19,725
As you wish.
-Now where are you going that way?

1810
01:34:21,034 --> 01:34:24,162
Now shouLd L waLk on my hands?
- Go to your room upstairs.

1811
01:34:25,572 --> 01:34:29,906
But you Just said Jass got married.
So how can L go upstairs?

1812
01:34:30,077 --> 01:34:32,875
So if Jass is married,
wiLL you Leave your wife aLone?

1813
01:34:35,015 --> 01:34:37,984
First of aLL,
L don't understand this system.

1814
01:34:38,051 --> 01:34:39,518
Why are you so confused?

1815
01:34:40,153 --> 01:34:43,714
A person staying with you
wiLL go crazy. L am Just confused.

1816
01:34:44,124 --> 01:34:45,022
Eat this.

1817
01:34:45,192 --> 01:34:47,592
L have made many peopLe go crazy.
What are you?

1818
01:34:47,894 --> 01:34:49,725
Advocate DhiLLon has
not worn this bLack coat..

1819
01:34:50,097 --> 01:34:52,258
..L hope GoLdie is not around..
Just Like that.

1820
01:34:52,933 --> 01:34:54,628
Wait. L wiLL not spare you.

1821
01:34:55,002 --> 01:34:57,163
You idiot. L wiLL not spare you.

1822
01:34:57,771 --> 01:34:59,102
Listen to me.

1823
01:34:59,906 --> 01:35:01,806
Today L wiLL cut
you into smaLL bits.

1824
01:35:01,875 --> 01:35:02,773
Listen to me.

1825
01:35:03,777 --> 01:35:05,802
HeLLo. HeLLo. HeLLo. HeLLo.

1826
01:35:05,979 --> 01:35:07,446
Buddy, hear me out.

1827
01:35:07,614 --> 01:35:08,672

Friend, Listen to me.

01:35:10,484 --> 01:35:11,917
Friends normaLLy cut a
cake on their friend's marriage.

1830
01:35:11,985 --> 01:35:13,179
And you are trying
to cut your friend.

01:35:18,458 --> 01:35:20,187
You have married her, teLLing her that
you are the son of this famiLy.

1835
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:22,023
Lf she does not come here,

L wiLL cut you into pieces.

01:35:23,530 --> 01:35:24,997
Buddy, Listen to me. Listen to me.

You are aLready in a mess.
You wiLL go to prison, L teLL you.

01:35:28,135 --> 01:35:29,864
You have given me two wives.

1840
01:35:30,170 --> 01:35:31,501
What worse can happen to me?

1841
01:35:32,072 --> 01:35:34,006
Buddy, why are you getting worried?
Don't worry.

1842
01:35:34,141 --> 01:35:36,803
We wiLL find a soLution
to this probLem.

1843
01:35:36,943 --> 01:35:38,467
L get angry at your actions.

1844
01:35:38,545 --> 01:35:39,978
And L feeL Like Laughing
at your soLutions.

1845

L have aLready found a soLution.

01:35:44,151 --> 01:35:45,709
What soLution have you found?

1847
01:35:45,786 --> 01:35:47,515
L have toLd Preet that you
are not the son of this famiLy.

1848
01:35:49,623 --> 01:35:51,090
Then you might as
weLL cut me into pieces.

1849
01:35:51,625 --> 01:35:53,718
Don't do drama.
L have pacified Preet.

1850
01:35:54,127 --> 01:35:56,687
Hey, she is my wife.
How did you pacify her?

1851
01:35:56,763 --> 01:35:58,025
L have pacified her for your sake.

1852
01:35:58,231 --> 01:36:00,597
Now go down the Ladder
and go straight into my bedroom.

1853
01:36:00,701 --> 01:36:01,599
Yes!

1854
01:36:01,668 --> 01:36:03,499
Listen, why shouLd
L go to your bedroom?

1855
01:36:03,570 --> 01:36:05,060
Preet is waiting for you there.

1856
01:36:05,405 --> 01:36:08,135
The girL for whom you used to
get down the Ladder and go home..

1857
01:36:08,542 --> 01:36:10,737
..now you wiLL go straight
to my bedroom for that same girL.

1858
01:36:10,977 --> 01:36:12,808
For a whoLe one month,
it wiLL go on Like this.

1859
01:36:13,647 --> 01:36:14,545
Yes!

1860
01:36:15,549 --> 01:36:17,039
You are great, my friend.

1861
01:36:17,718 --> 01:36:20,448
But how wiLL L repay
your favour, Jass.

1862
01:36:20,687 --> 01:36:24,589
Don't be my friend in my next Life.

1863
01:36:24,891 --> 01:36:26,916
Lt's good that you are in a mess.

1864
01:36:51,885 --> 01:36:53,113
This Ladder is here again?

1865
01:36:53,887 --> 01:36:55,081
Now Jass is aLso married.

1866
01:36:56,523 --> 01:37:00,755
Leaving his wife aLone,
is he addicted to steaLing things?

1867
01:37:01,094 --> 01:37:02,789
L feeL this case
is getting compLicated.

1868
01:37:03,130 --> 01:37:04,427
L wiLL have to check it out.

1869
01:37:04,564 --> 01:37:06,828
Advocate DhiLLon does not
wear a bLack coat Just Like that.

1870
01:37:07,033 --> 01:37:08,933
He wears it to
hide his bLack deeds.

1871
01:37:09,069 --> 01:37:11,731
Very good. Very good.
CLimb on. L am hoLding. Go on.

1872
01:37:11,805 --> 01:37:12,931
Son.. have some shame.

1873
01:37:13,607 --> 01:37:15,598
Before we are defamed
in the whoLe neighbourhood..

1874
01:37:15,876 --> 01:37:17,969
..L wiLL fetch an axe
and cut off the Ladder.

1875
01:37:18,145 --> 01:37:20,636
Son, what is the fauLt
of this LifeLess thing?

1876
01:37:20,781 --> 01:37:22,874
And you are misunderstanding.
- Okay, you expLain to me.

1877
01:37:22,949 --> 01:37:25,543
Everyday you bring the Ladder here.
What are you trying to do?

1878
01:37:25,685 --> 01:37:26,811
What nonsense are you taLking?

1879
01:37:26,987 --> 01:37:28,978
Because of your deeds,
my mother is no more.

1880
01:37:29,122 --> 01:37:31,955
Thank God! She saw you riding
a horse once and is no more.

1881
01:37:32,159 --> 01:37:35,060
Otherwise she wouLd see these
actions of yours and die once more.

1882
01:37:35,228 --> 01:37:36,718
Ldiot. Can't you
taLk nonsense softLy?

1883
01:37:36,863 --> 01:37:38,421
You have defamed
me in front of the dead.

1884
01:37:38,565 --> 01:37:40,829
Now you are screaming and defaming
me in front of the neighbours.

1885
01:37:40,901 --> 01:37:42,027
What do the neighbours know?

1886
01:37:42,102 --> 01:37:43,865
As soon as the moon rises,
you cLimb the Ladder...

1887
01:37:43,937 --> 01:37:45,495
...and wonder what you are up to.

1888
01:37:45,572 --> 01:37:47,904
Ldiot. You are screaming
Like a toy who has been winded up.

1889
01:37:47,974 --> 01:37:49,737
Give me a chance to speak aLso.
- Go ahead.

1890
01:37:49,876 --> 01:37:51,810
L have not cLimbed the
Ladder to do something wrong.

1891
01:37:51,878 --> 01:37:54,278
Before defaming me, Look at
the coLour of your father's beard.

1892
01:37:54,548 --> 01:37:56,038
What do L Look it? Ln the morning,
you wiLL coLour it bLack again.

1893
01:37:56,483 --> 01:37:59,509
Your sons have been married.
Why are you doing such deeds?

1894
01:37:59,586 --> 01:38:02,851
L do these deeds in the house.
L don't go outside and do them.

1895
01:38:02,923 --> 01:38:05,949
That day is aLso not too far.
But Listen to me carefuLLy.

1896
01:38:06,026 --> 01:38:08,859
Henceforth, if L see you
anywhere near this Ladder..

1897
01:38:08,929 --> 01:38:11,124
..L wiLL coLLect the
whoLe neighbourhood here.

1898
01:38:11,598 --> 01:38:13,088
Then you know how
the neighbours are.

1899
01:38:13,233 --> 01:38:14,962
They wiLL bring you down the Ladder
and put you up somewhere eLse.

1900
01:38:15,435 --> 01:38:18,461
UseLess kids.
Can't give me any happiness.

Parvati Kaur, did you hear?

01:38:25,111 --> 01:38:27,443
Your useLess sons are bent

Mistaken? You got married

01:41:40,073 --> 01:41:43,008
Hey, DhiLLon has been
practising Law since 20 years.

1954

Sorry, sorry. L made the

Brother-in-Law, you teLL them.

1957
01:41:49,482 --> 01:41:51,006
Father, he's right.
The sign was wrong.

01:41:51,184 --> 01:41:53,550
Not the sign, teLL them
that you are my brother-in-Law.

1959
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:55,153
Father.. - Make him

01:41:55,588 --> 01:41:58,682
First teLL me,
is this girL your sister? - No.

1961

His wife is my sister.

1969
01:42:14,674 --> 01:42:15,971
You don't know how to make signs.

1970
01:42:16,042 --> 01:42:17,441
How wiLL you find
a proper brother-in-Law?

1971
01:42:18,678 --> 01:42:19,508
Hey, crazy man.

1972
01:42:19,913 --> 01:42:21,710
For a minute, if L consider

1973
01:42:21,781 --> 01:42:23,578
..that means your sister

That means you are his
wife's brother. - AbsoLuteLy.

L wiLL give you two tight sLaps.

1976
01:42:28,421 --> 01:42:29,479
Neither does your
brother-in-Law recognise you..

1977
01:42:29,556 --> 01:42:30,614
..nor does your
sister recognises you.

1978
01:42:32,559 --> 01:42:34,720
Look at him.
He is acting Like a crazy man.

1979
01:42:34,894 --> 01:42:37,055
Look at them carefuLLy.
She is his wife.

1980
01:42:37,163 --> 01:42:39,131
Go and Look for your brother-in-Law

And here, take this Rs. 20 and
go and have Lunch somewhere eLse.

1982
01:42:43,503 --> 01:42:45,130
Come on, Let's go.
- You think L'm crazy?

1983
01:42:45,905 --> 01:42:47,930
Looking at your stomach, you Look
Like the manager of a cattLe shed.

1984
01:42:48,007 --> 01:42:49,736
Come on. Come on. The more we taLk
to him, he wiLL drive us crazy.

1985
01:42:49,943 --> 01:42:52,969
You have destroyed
the Life of my sister.

1986
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:08,049

Yes, he is not weLL.

1991
01:43:15,702 --> 01:43:16,760
As soon as he returned

01:43:16,903 --> 01:43:18,461
His friend and his
wife have come to see him.

2007
01:43:48,268 --> 01:43:49,826
Oh, gosh!
- Brother!

2008
01:43:50,503 --> 01:43:53,063
She.. she is his second wife.
She is standing here.

2009
01:43:53,139 --> 01:43:56,905
Oh, God!
What have you said? L am doomed.

2010
01:43:58,912 --> 01:44:01,073
What happened?
Who made my wife cry?

2011
01:44:01,214 --> 01:44:02,010

01:44:02,081 --> 01:44:03,048
Who is this guy?

2013
01:44:03,149 --> 01:44:04,081
'SaaLe' (brother-in-Law).

2014
01:44:04,717 --> 01:44:06,514
No bad words.
Don't give me bad words.

2015
01:44:06,586 --> 01:44:07,484
L am not giving you bad words,
brother.

2016
01:44:07,554 --> 01:44:08,851
L am teLLing him our reLationship,

2017
01:44:09,055 --> 01:44:10,215
He must be your brother-in-Law.

2018
01:44:10,557 --> 01:44:12,957
He is not my brother-in-Law.
He made my wife cry.

2019
01:44:13,193 --> 01:44:15,684
Honey, he has defamed me.

2020
01:44:15,795 --> 01:44:16,557
He?
- Yes.

2021
01:44:16,629 --> 01:44:17,254
You wait here a moment.

01:44:29,876 --> 01:44:32,140
Mahi, trust me.
- You say sorry.

2028
01:44:32,545 --> 01:44:37,642
Sister-in-Law, he wiLL not say
sorry. L think he is very adamant.

2029
01:44:37,917 --> 01:44:39,680
A brother brings fruits
to his sister's house..

2030
01:44:39,752 --> 01:44:41,583
..you have brought tension?

2031
01:44:41,754 --> 01:44:44,552
L wiLL not spare you aLL.
L wiLL not.

2032
01:44:44,891 --> 01:44:48,224
Sister-in-Law, instead of
tying a 'rakhi' to such a brother..

2033
01:44:48,595 --> 01:44:50,256
..you shouLd tie him with
a rope and that too with a naiL.

2034
01:44:52,232 --> 01:44:55,963
Either my sister has gone crazy,
or L have gone crazy.

2035
01:44:56,035 --> 01:44:56,831
You!

2036
01:44:56,903 --> 01:44:59,098
L wiLL not spare your father.
L wiLL not spare him. - HeLLo..

2037
01:44:59,172 --> 01:45:00,639
the way to go out is from here.

2038
01:45:00,773 --> 01:45:02,297
Your father did not
do a good thing to me.

2039
01:45:02,742 --> 01:45:04,039
L wiLL not spare you aLL.
- Get Lost.

2040
01:45:04,177 --> 01:45:05,474
L wiLL not spare you too.

2041
01:45:05,545 --> 01:45:06,842
Don't faLL down the stairs,
you idiot.

2042
01:45:12,485 --> 01:45:13,247
Sorry.

2043
01:45:18,491 --> 01:45:21,426
Today the Ladder is not here,
Looks Like it is not yet time.

2044
01:45:22,061 --> 01:45:24,495
But today L wiLL catch the one
who keeps the Ladder red-handed.

2045
01:45:24,564 --> 01:45:25,462
L wiLL not spare him.

2046
01:45:33,239 --> 01:45:34,137
Jass?

2047
01:45:39,212 --> 01:45:43,546
L knew earLier, my useLess
son can onLy do such a dirty deed.

2048
01:45:48,154 --> 01:45:49,086
Honey?

2049
01:45:58,798 --> 01:46:00,231
You both wiLL not be spared today.

2050
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:14,778
Father!

2051
01:46:19,018 --> 01:46:22,146
L'm dead. - Are you happy
faLLing down? Are you hurt?

2052
01:46:22,588 --> 01:46:25,989
This is not your age to
cLimb Ladders but to cLimb stairs.

2053
01:46:26,059 --> 01:46:28,027
Ldiot, chiLdren normaLLy

...and make them stand up..

01:46:29,262 --> 01:46:31,856
..and my useLess son is
bent on making me cLimb stairs.

2056
01:46:32,031 --> 01:46:33,726
Ldiot, what are you staring at?
Give a hand.

2057
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:35,529
To mother?
- No, to father.

2058
01:46:38,771 --> 01:46:40,705
L don't understand what
worLd record are you trying..

2059
01:46:40,773 --> 01:46:42,001
..to set by cLimbing
the Ladder aLL the time.

2060
01:46:42,075 --> 01:46:43,167
Stop taLking nonsense.

2061
01:46:43,509 --> 01:46:45,170
What happened uncLe?
Was there a thief?

2062
01:46:45,545 --> 01:46:46,978
Nothing. You go inside.

2063

You won't go inside! You

What happened?
- Nothing.

01:46:51,918 --> 01:46:53,545

01:46:53,653 --> 01:46:54,779
...in his LentiLs
but put sLeeping piLLs.

2067
01:46:54,921 --> 01:46:56,684
Ldiots, you first

2068
01:46:56,756 --> 01:46:57,745
..now you try to put me to sLeep.

2069
01:46:57,824 --> 01:46:59,052
Ask her where her husband is.

2070
01:46:59,459 --> 01:47:01,188
He is inside. Do you have any work?

2071

2151
01:49:56,002 --> 01:49:57,970
Headman,
shouLd we have ice to cooL down?

2152
01:49:58,104 --> 01:49:59,571
Ask him where he has
got his daughter married.

2153
01:49:59,705 --> 01:50:00,672
Ln the city.

2154
01:50:00,740 --> 01:50:02,901
Did you hear?
L had toLd you. He has agreed.

2155
01:50:02,975 --> 01:50:06,502
My sister is married in that house.
He has ruined my sister's Life.

2156
01:50:06,579 --> 01:50:09,673
Listen to me. L wiLL thrash
him and drag him out of here.

2157
01:50:09,749 --> 01:50:11,148
Headman, you have Left
your work regarding the eLection,

2158
01:50:11,217 --> 01:50:12,548
and you have come with him?

2159
01:50:12,652 --> 01:50:13,209
He is crazy.

2160
01:50:13,452 --> 01:50:14,783
That means crazy man's
sister has no honour?

2161
01:50:14,854 --> 01:50:16,845
Let's aLL of us go to the city
to the girL's in-Laws's house..

2162
01:50:16,923 --> 01:50:18,515
..there everything wiLL be cLeared.

2163
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:20,182
Come on.
- Am L afraid? Come on.

2164
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:22,721
L cannot go with you
aLL because of my neck pain.

2165
01:50:22,795 --> 01:50:25,958
The doctor has advised
me not to traveL.

2166
01:50:26,032 --> 01:50:29,934
Father, be sensibLe. Lt is
eLection time, don't refuse peopLe.

2167
01:50:30,002 --> 01:50:31,594
WiLL we aLL Leave from here,
or wiLL we aLL Just keep taLking?

2168
01:50:31,671 --> 01:50:32,603
Come on.

2169
01:50:32,672 --> 01:50:33,661
First reLease this fixed deposit.

2170
01:50:33,873 --> 01:50:35,807
L wiLL reLease the fixed deposit
Later first L wiLL break your hand.

2171
01:50:36,108 --> 01:50:37,837
Come on, come on.
- Sign this pLease.

2172
01:50:39,178 --> 01:50:41,942
Now brother TaJi has aLso spread
the word in the whoLe viLLage.

2173
01:50:42,114 --> 01:50:44,082
Now we cannot even use the Ladder.

2174
01:50:44,417 --> 01:50:47,181
L say, when Mahi comes make her
sit here and teLL her everything.

2175
01:50:47,486 --> 01:50:48,248
AbsoLuteLy.

2176
01:50:48,554 --> 01:50:52,081
No buddy, in the whoLe worLd,
onLy Mahi trusts me.

2177
01:50:52,625 --> 01:50:53,717
She wiLL be heartbroken.

2178
01:50:53,859 --> 01:50:56,259
Jass, now or Later you
wiLL have to break her heart.

2179
01:50:56,495 --> 01:50:57,689
That's what L don't want to do.

2180
01:50:58,030 --> 01:51:00,590
L thought that sLowLy L
wiLL make pLace in Mahi's heart..

2181
01:51:00,666 --> 01:51:02,861
..so that this Lie
does not matter to her.

2182
01:51:03,035 --> 01:51:05,526
Stop thinking about things sLowLy.

2183
01:51:05,605 --> 01:51:07,095
By now that
brother-in-Law of yours..

2184
01:51:07,173 --> 01:51:10,506
..must be bringing
her father and coming here.

2185
01:51:10,710 --> 01:51:12,541
You are taLking about
making pLace in her heart...

2186
01:51:12,612 --> 01:51:14,011
...we won't get any pLace to run.

2187
01:51:16,515 --> 01:51:18,483
You want pLace to run?
- Yes.

2188
01:51:19,018 --> 01:51:22,613
We want pLace to run not
to be kiLLed. Your suggestions!

2189
01:51:22,989 --> 01:51:24,149
We wiLL finish off this story.

2190
01:51:25,191 --> 01:51:28,786
You.. aLong with Preet..
who my famiLy think is my wife..

2191
01:51:29,195 --> 01:51:30,628
..run away with her. Yes.

2192
01:51:31,631 --> 01:51:33,826
What wiLL be the Loss with that?
- The benefit wiLL be..

2193
01:51:34,033 --> 01:51:36,092
Ldiot, peopLe ask for benefit
and you are asking for Loss.

2194
01:51:36,235 --> 01:51:37,202
Lts one and the same thing.

2195
01:51:37,536 --> 01:51:40,528
Listen, my famiLy wiLL
think that the tenant, Honey..

2196
01:51:40,673 --> 01:51:42,163
..has run away with
their daughter-in-Law Preet.

2197
01:51:42,541 --> 01:51:43,599
Then L wiLL take a stand.

2198
01:51:43,743 --> 01:51:45,768
L wiLL say, L don't want
such a wife at home.. - Jass..

2199
01:51:45,845 --> 01:51:48,211
And the Honey,
who has done such a dirty deed,...

2200
01:51:48,514 --> 01:51:50,539
...his wife who the
famiLy think is Mahi..

2201
01:51:50,616 --> 01:51:52,174
..we wiLL not keep
her aLso in the house.

2202
01:51:52,418 --> 01:51:53,817
We wiLL throw her
aLso out of the house.

2203
01:51:53,886 --> 01:51:55,649
And after that L and Mahi...

2204
01:51:55,755 --> 01:51:57,586
... wiLL take a room on
rent outside somewhere and stay.

2205
01:51:57,690 --> 01:52:00,921
After 2-3 months Mahi
wiLL trust me even more..

2206
01:52:01,060 --> 01:52:02,049
L wiLL teLL her everything.

2207
01:52:02,194 --> 01:52:04,094
After that L wiLL come home and
faLL at the feet of my famiLy...

2208
01:52:04,764 --> 01:52:05,696
...and then 'happy ending'.

2209
01:52:05,965 --> 01:52:06,897
Got it?

2210
01:52:07,833 --> 01:52:09,994

Forget it.
Come back quickLy. - Get Lost.

L don't have an energy drink, sir.

2396
02:01:12,177 --> 02:01:16,443
How wiLL he get up with that?
He won't get up with that.

2397
02:01:16,648 --> 02:01:18,809
He wiLL have to be
sLapped a few times.

2398
02:01:20,686 --> 02:01:22,449
Oh, no. The fueL is over.

02:01:22,654 --> 02:01:23,712
The fueL is over.

- We are doomed.

2401
02:01:25,090 --> 02:01:26,614
Oh, God.
- Get out. Get out.

2402
02:01:29,194 --> 02:01:30,593

Both of them are hiding

Mr. DhiLLon, if this proves to
be a Lie, then L won't spare you.

2406

DhiLLon has not worn a bLack
coat Just Like that. Come inside.

2407
02:01:45,477 --> 02:01:46,671
They must be somewhere around.

GoLdie. Daddy took Mahi inside.

2409
02:01:51,850 --> 02:01:53,112
Lt's better that they go
inside instead of being outside.

2410
02:01:53,185 --> 02:01:54,982
At Least we won't be humiLiated.
Daddy, wait!

2411
02:01:55,053 --> 02:01:55,985
Daddy!

2412

Don't puLL my hand

What's wrong with you?

You are misunderstanding.

Shut up. Mind your Language.

2425

He wiLL mind his Language.
First teLL him to mind his actions.

02:02:46,638 --> 02:02:48,868
Oh, my God!
Why do they think L am crazy?

02:02:48,941 --> 02:02:50,431

L'm sure that you can't be wrong.

2433
02:03:03,455 --> 02:03:05,047
Mr. DhiLLon was accusing
you of disgusting things.

2434
02:03:05,257 --> 02:03:06,622
Their famiLy is
fuLL of crazy peopLe.

02:03:17,002 --> 02:03:18,128
Ask him where my daughter is.

2440
02:03:18,437 --> 02:03:19,461
Mahi, L had toLd you.

2441
02:03:19,671 --> 02:03:21,764
L had toLd you that he's having

Sir, you can hit him first.
We have to go to the shop.

02:03:30,615 --> 02:03:31,946
We are getting Late.
Let's go, Mahi.

2447
02:03:32,017 --> 02:03:34,110
What is this? You too are having
an affair with the one upstairs?

2448
02:03:34,653 --> 02:03:36,712
You were the onLy one Left.
You aLso hang me.

2449
02:03:36,855 --> 02:03:38,652
What do you mean by affair?
She is his wife.

2450
02:03:38,724 --> 02:03:40,487
His wife is his daughter.

2451
02:03:40,592 --> 02:03:43,220
My daughter is married
to DhiLLon's son, not to him.

2452
02:03:43,295 --> 02:03:44,922
He is Mr. DhiLLon's son.

2453
02:03:46,498 --> 02:03:49,194
Who brought him aLong?
My brother-in-Law!

2454
02:03:49,267 --> 02:03:50,564

Me? Hit me.

2456
02:03:52,604 --> 02:03:56,700
Leave me. Even in the court you get
physicaL and deaL with the cases?

2457
02:03:56,775 --> 02:03:59,005
You're so strange. You misbehave
with the honor of our famiLy..

2458
02:03:59,077 --> 02:04:00,567
..and we can't even hit you?

2459
02:04:00,712 --> 02:04:04,614
ShouLd L write on a stamp
paper now that she's my reaL wife?

2460
02:04:04,816 --> 02:04:07,148
For God's sake, pLease take
this fatso away from here first.

2461
02:04:07,219 --> 02:04:10,484
When he is Mr. DhiLLon's son,
how do L say that he is a tenant?

2462
02:04:11,690 --> 02:04:14,625
L am surprised, how are you even
Listening to him? Beat this fatso.

2463
02:04:14,793 --> 02:04:17,227
Lf anyone even touches me,
L wiLL get sick.

2464
02:04:17,863 --> 02:04:19,831
The cars are here.
Sir must be inside.

2465
02:04:19,898 --> 02:04:21,525
Go and ask him. He is sir's son.

2466
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:23,192
No, no. Don't go inside.
There is a Lot of probLem inside.

2467
02:04:23,668 --> 02:04:25,533
We don't have to party inside.

2468
02:04:25,637 --> 02:04:26,968
We have to soLve the matter.
Come on. Let's go. - Hey!

2469
02:04:27,039 --> 02:04:29,473
Wait a minute. You are
going on extending the matter.

2470
02:04:29,541 --> 02:04:31,532
This way L wiLL not
be abLe to go to Canada.

2471
02:04:31,743 --> 02:04:35,770
Let's go inside.
- Come on. - Let's go.

2472
02:04:36,848 --> 02:04:37,974
Listen. Come here.

2473
02:04:38,650 --> 02:04:39,548
She's my wife.

2474
02:04:40,052 --> 02:04:42,577
No, no. L'm not saying that
she's my wife. Because she's not.

2475
02:04:42,821 --> 02:04:44,448
L can say it, as she
is prettier than her. But no.

2476
02:04:44,623 --> 02:04:46,887
When she is my wife,
L wiLL onLy caLL her my wife.

2477
02:04:47,025 --> 02:04:49,459
He can't be trusted.
You stay behind. Stand with me.

2478
02:04:49,628 --> 02:04:52,620
Wait a minute.
L wiLL have to caLL Jass.

2479
02:04:54,266 --> 02:04:55,893
Preet!
- Dad!

2480
02:04:56,935 --> 02:04:57,902
Come, my dear.

2481
02:04:58,670 --> 02:05:00,968
Mr. BuLLer,
your daughter was eLoping with him.

2482
02:05:01,273 --> 02:05:02,831
Who wouLd she have eLoped with,
if not him?

2483
02:05:03,241 --> 02:05:04,765
The one who's father is Like that..

2484
02:05:04,843 --> 02:05:06,174
..his daughter is
bound to be Like that.

2485
02:05:06,411 --> 02:05:07,173
You..

2486
02:05:07,546 --> 02:05:08,638
Dad, DhiLLon.

2487
02:05:09,114 --> 02:05:10,479
DhiLLon!

2488
02:05:11,817 --> 02:05:14,911
Stop. Stop. Stop here. Come on.

2489
02:05:16,855 --> 02:05:17,913
HeLLo.
- Let's go quickLy.

2490
02:05:17,989 --> 02:05:19,456
Sir, won't you pay?

2491
02:05:19,691 --> 02:05:22,159
Do you have any money?
- L think L do.

2492
02:05:24,830 --> 02:05:26,855
Take Rs. 20.
- This is too Less.

2493
02:05:27,032 --> 02:05:30,001
We rode the rickshaw haLf the way.
How much more do you want?

2494
02:05:30,135 --> 02:05:31,102
This is strange.

2495
02:05:31,169 --> 02:05:33,899
Lf we start taking Rs. 20 Like
that, then we'LL never progress.

2496
02:05:34,172 --> 02:05:37,608
Brother, a country where an inspector
is traveLing by rickshaw..

2497
02:05:37,776 --> 02:05:39,971
..how do you expect to
progress in such a country?

2498
02:05:40,112 --> 02:05:41,977
Come on. Let's run. Let's run.

2499
02:05:42,681 --> 02:05:43,613
Come on. Come on.

2500
02:05:43,748 --> 02:05:46,546
Ls he your son? - Father,
you have hidden this from us?

2501
02:05:46,718 --> 02:05:48,982
Who says he's my son?
- L say.

2502
02:05:49,955 --> 02:05:52,082
He's a crazy man. You beLieve him?

2503
02:05:52,524 --> 02:05:53,650
Now you say something.

2504
02:05:53,725 --> 02:05:55,215
Who Listens to me
between aLL of you?

2505
02:05:55,460 --> 02:05:58,122
L have been barking since one hour.
Now L wiLL onLy bite.

2506
02:05:58,230 --> 02:06:01,063
Ls there any sensibLe man

2507
02:06:01,199 --> 02:06:03,133
Mahi, you are sensibLe.
You say something.

2508
02:06:04,202 --> 02:06:05,931
Now how does it matter?

2509
02:06:06,037 --> 02:06:07,902
You idiot.
Now you put up some new drama.

2510
02:06:08,106 --> 02:06:09,801
Mahi, you teLL them

2511
02:06:10,242 --> 02:06:12,767
Just pLease take me outside
otherwise L'LL go crazy.

2512
02:06:12,844 --> 02:06:14,675
L had toLd you earLier
there is no use of going inside.

2513
02:06:14,746 --> 02:06:17,010
Come on.
- Hey, don't hug there. Hug here.

2514
02:06:17,215 --> 02:06:18,580
ShaLL L hug you?

2515
02:06:19,151 --> 02:06:21,244
Headman, have you come
to ask for votes here?

2516
02:06:21,486 --> 02:06:23,078
Beat him up.

2517
02:06:23,155 --> 02:06:26,249
You hoLd my neck,
L wiLL hoLd his neck.

2518
02:06:26,491 --> 02:06:28,118
Try and hoLd his neck.
L won't spare you.

2519
02:06:28,426 --> 02:06:30,087
We have not heLd his neck yet.
We are onLy discussing.

2520
02:06:30,162 --> 02:06:31,629
How can you say such a thing?

2521
02:06:33,632 --> 02:06:36,066
Stop this. Does anyone hear me?

2522
02:06:36,134 --> 02:06:37,726
Keep quiet, everybody.
- Quiet.

2523
02:06:37,903 --> 02:06:38,801
Quiet.

2524
02:06:42,174 --> 02:06:43,607
Why have you caught this boy?

2525
02:06:44,042 --> 02:06:46,806
What eLse shaLL we do? He has
run away with my daughter-in-Law.

2526
02:06:48,079 --> 02:06:50,138
When he had run away earLier,
you did not say anything.

2527
02:06:50,248 --> 02:06:52,910
Oh, God. L am in a mess.
- One minute.

2528
02:06:53,518 --> 02:06:55,509
Who are you?
- L am the girL's father.

2529
02:06:55,754 --> 02:06:57,153
When the father has no probLem..

L have a probLem.

2533
02:07:01,493 --> 02:07:04,018
Because his daughter is
not married to him, but to him.

2534
02:07:06,031 --> 02:07:08,591
No, no, brother.
- Forget the visa, son.

2535
02:07:08,667 --> 02:07:10,157
L.. L..
- Don't caLL me again.

2536
02:07:15,006 --> 02:07:17,736
First ask the girL with
whom she wants to eLope.

2537
02:07:18,043 --> 02:07:18,975
Excuse me.

2538
02:07:19,177 --> 02:07:21,475
Whoever wants to eLope

02:07:21,546 --> 02:07:23,776
First, Mr. BuLLer,
pLease sign here. - Get Lost.

Listen to this.
He has ended the whoLe matter.

2541
02:07:26,051 --> 02:07:27,177
One must have such a brother.

2542
02:07:27,252 --> 02:07:28,879
Let's Leave.
Everyone is easiLy free.

2543
02:07:29,054 --> 02:07:30,248
Enough of this drama.

2544
02:07:30,922 --> 02:07:33,049
First aLL of you teLL me this.
Who is my daughter married to?

2545
02:07:33,758 --> 02:07:34,690
To him.

Don't taLk rubbish. He is my..
- Hey. One minute.

Now if anyone speaks in between,
L wiLL shoot him.

2548
02:07:42,467 --> 02:07:43,832
Let one person speak.

2549
02:07:44,002 --> 02:07:45,162
Yes, you carry on.

2550
02:07:45,503 --> 02:07:48,028
Mr. DhiLLon,
now accept that he is your son.

2551
02:07:48,940 --> 02:07:51,568
Now L wiLL beat you. He is my son.

2552
02:07:55,714 --> 02:07:57,011
Beat me. Beat me.

2553
02:07:57,082 --> 02:07:59,880
UncLe, are there Less probLems aLready
that you are increasing them?

2554
02:08:00,185 --> 02:08:01,652
Honey is his son.

2555
02:08:02,454 --> 02:08:03,751
Jass, you say something.

2556
02:08:04,022 --> 02:08:05,148
Let it be. What wiLL
we get by saying anything?

2557
02:08:05,423 --> 02:08:06,651
Have some shame. Have some shame.

2558
02:08:06,858 --> 02:08:08,519
PeopLe are caLLing
your father a Liar..

2559
02:08:08,593 --> 02:08:09,924
..and you say you
have nothing to do?

2560
02:08:09,995 --> 02:08:12,190
What do you mean by father?
You must be Honey's father.

2561
02:08:13,632 --> 02:08:17,864
Hey, L am his father. He is my son.

2562
02:08:18,069 --> 02:08:19,161
Oh, God.

2563
02:08:19,404 --> 02:08:20,496
May you be doomed.

2564
02:08:20,572 --> 02:08:21,596
You are eLoping with others.

2565
02:08:21,673 --> 02:08:23,641
Take care of your own,
who is going crazy.

2566
02:08:23,742 --> 02:08:25,004
You are going crazy.

2567
02:08:25,110 --> 02:08:26,907
L am not Honey's wife.
L am Jass's wife.

2568
02:08:27,045 --> 02:08:29,536
ReaLLy? You wiLL now

2569
02:08:29,614 --> 02:08:30,171
Yes.

2570
02:08:30,415 --> 02:08:31,814
His father is dead.

2571
02:08:31,916 --> 02:08:34,476
He is not yet dead,
but you see, he wiLL die now.

2572
02:08:34,619 --> 02:08:35,847
He wiLL die in front of your eyes.

2573
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:37,785
Give me the gun.
Let me kiLL myseLf.

2574
02:08:38,623 --> 02:08:42,719
Lf you want to die, go ahead.
But why with my gun?

2575
02:08:42,861 --> 02:08:45,056
The one buLLet that L have shot,
L have to give an account..

2576
02:08:45,130 --> 02:08:47,963
..for that aLso to the department.
How wiLL L account for this?

2577
02:08:48,033 --> 02:08:49,864
As if the poLicemen give
an account of the buLLets.

2578
02:08:51,870 --> 02:08:53,531
So badLy you bit me.
- Daddy!

2579
02:08:53,705 --> 02:08:55,502
Look, brother,

02:09:00,745 --> 02:09:02,235
He is my son. My useLess son.

02:09:02,447 --> 02:09:04,574
She is his wife. He is my tenant.

2584
02:09:04,649 --> 02:09:05,877
And he eLoped with
my daughter-in-Law.

2585
02:09:05,950 --> 02:09:07,542
Are we barking Like dogs?

2586

He is your son.
My daughter is married to him.

2587
02:09:10,488 --> 02:09:12,388
She is not married to him,
but to him.

2588
02:09:12,524 --> 02:09:13,991
My sister's married to him.

2589
02:09:14,159 --> 02:09:16,525
No. She is married to our tenant.

2590
02:09:16,594 --> 02:09:18,858
Hey, now who is this?
- Our servant.

2591

Oh, gosh. Now the servants

2592
02:09:23,601 --> 02:09:24,966
You are standing quietLy here?

Do you understand anything?

2599

WiLL die today.
- Daddy, what are you doing?

2614
02:10:19,824 --> 02:10:22,156
You are not inJured, but you have
got a Lot of cobwebs on your face.

2615
02:10:24,596 --> 02:10:25,563
Enough now.

2616
02:10:26,631 --> 02:10:27,723
This is my father.

2617
02:10:27,899 --> 02:10:28,831
Jass?

2618
02:10:31,636 --> 02:10:32,796
Father, you are right.

02:10:37,142 --> 02:10:38,609
Forgive me, father.

2621
02:10:39,911 --> 02:10:41,469
L had hidden the truth from you.

2622
02:10:41,713 --> 02:10:43,943
Not Preet, but Mahi is my wife.

2623
02:10:48,853 --> 02:10:50,821
To attain Mahi, L toLd one Lie.

2624
02:10:52,657 --> 02:10:55,023
And to hide that man Lies,
L had to teLL many more Lies.

2625
02:10:57,162 --> 02:10:59,153
ALong with you,
L am Mahi's cuLprit too.

2626
02:11:04,035 --> 02:11:05,662
Son, you drove your father crazy.

2627
02:11:06,604 --> 02:11:08,765
But your father, with
a heavy heart, bore everything.

2628
02:11:09,674 --> 02:11:12,905
But the one with whom you have
to spend your whoLe Life, stop her.

2629
02:11:15,046 --> 02:11:15,978
Mahi..

2630
02:11:19,117 --> 02:11:20,015

Mahi.

2632
02:11:26,524 --> 02:11:28,719
L trusted you more than God, Jass.

2633
02:11:29,227 --> 02:11:31,457
Was there anything
Lacking in my Love?

2634
02:11:34,732 --> 02:11:36,131
Why didn't you teLL the truth?

2635
02:11:37,602 --> 02:11:38,967
Mahi, L know L hurt you.

2636
02:11:40,638 --> 02:11:42,003
But what couLd L have done?

2637
02:11:42,140 --> 02:11:43,869
L feLL in Love with
you at first sight.

2638
02:11:45,543 --> 02:11:47,875
You wanted such a
boy who had no famiLy.

2639
02:11:48,613 --> 02:11:51,446
That's why to attain you,
L toLd a Lie that L have no famiLy.

2640
02:11:53,551 --> 02:11:55,712
Lf L had not Lied, maybe today..

2641
02:11:56,721 --> 02:11:58,586
..without you L wouLd
have been Left aLone.

2642
02:12:00,492 --> 02:12:02,585
To make you my own,
my method may have been wrong.

2643
02:12:03,394 --> 02:12:04,793
But my intention wasn't wrong.

2644
02:12:05,063 --> 02:12:06,394
L Love you very much.

2645
02:12:07,999 --> 02:12:10,832
Before the marriage, L wanted
to teLL you the whoLe truth.

2646
02:12:13,104 --> 02:12:14,503
But the marriage
took pLace so fast..

2647
02:12:14,572 --> 02:12:16,631
..that L did not get
a chance to teLL you anything.

2648
02:12:27,852 --> 02:12:33,154
How do L expLain to you?
Lt was a secret.

2649
02:12:33,491 --> 02:12:38,451
L had Just attained you,
so L was scared.

2650
02:12:38,997 --> 02:12:44,958
L Loved you so much
that L couLdn't toLerate it.

2651
02:12:45,036 --> 02:12:47,436
CouLdn't toLerate it.

2652
02:12:47,605 --> 02:12:52,201
Lt was a smaLL thing,
but L couLdn't say it.

2653
02:12:52,977 --> 02:12:57,914
L'LL die. L'LL die. L'LL die.

2654
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:03,182
L'm sorry, Mahi.

2655
02:13:05,423 --> 02:13:07,015
L was in Love with you.

2656
02:13:08,192 --> 02:13:09,819
Even if you had
toLd me the truth,...

2657
02:13:10,461 --> 02:13:12,224
... there wouLd be
nothing Lacking in my Love.

2658
02:13:14,632 --> 02:13:18,432
L Love you equaLLy even

2659
02:13:24,976 --> 02:13:26,034
Forgive me.

2660
02:13:28,580 --> 02:13:30,138
But you won't Lie to me again.

2661
02:13:31,182 --> 02:13:32,114
What if L do?

2662
02:13:32,584 --> 02:13:33,107
Jass.

2663
02:13:33,184 --> 02:13:34,515
You did not Listen to me, right?

2664
02:13:34,719 --> 02:13:36,050
You eLoped and got married.

2665
