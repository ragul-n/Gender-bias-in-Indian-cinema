He has changed the house as the court!

8
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,546
He himself is the prosecution side,
opposite side and the judge.

-Are you those, Anto sir

23
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:09,446
What is your problem?

00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:12,447
l will tell you in short!
-That's enough!

25
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:18,318

00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,322
We couldn't buy it

30
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,146
He told us the time is over for us.
He then sold it to a party in the north.

lt is a mean thing to count it.

35
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,096
When the dying dad comes back to life..

36
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:49,740

you got him back fully

37

A share for the almighty,
and another for Caesar!

44
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,529
Shanmugam sir deserves one too!

They are kids of about
18 to 22 years of age.

54
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,405
Sharaf is the main culprit
in 4 murder cases!

00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,404
He has never been
in the jail for full 4 years!

He is the most dangerous of all.

66

These 5 youths are behind
all the criminal activities in city!

67
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,238
They work as
5 different groups.

68
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,912
A super brain coordinates
them and organizes them.

69
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,275
lt gives the share
to each group and controls them.

70
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,450
Who ever be the ruling party..

71
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,484
..they give the support to them!

72
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,952
These five kids are
not strong physically.

73
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:57,959
Nobody dare to touch them
in our department.

74
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,995
Jails are like their
own houses.

75
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:05,168
lt is a favourable spot
like a picnic spot.

76
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,302
The earliest phone
call for them,will be the..

77
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,509
..minister's who camps in the city.

78

79
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:17,145
They will not allow
me to have my sleep.

80
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,641
Let alone ruling the nation.

81
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,341
Law and Order
can go to hell.

82
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,320
Move away, man.

83
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,159
ls the minister not in?

84
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,889

and all others are here.

85
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:36,530

86
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,494
Are the media people
waiting out?

87
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,167
What reply will l give them
for their irritable questions?

88
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,403
Can we ministers take up police duty..

89
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,013
..and maintain law and order?

90
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,852
That's why you are
paid as the police officers.

91
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,049
lf we give you freedom,
you will over act!

92
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,520
That will be the
down fall of the ministry!

93
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:04,887
What happened in the highway?

94
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,555
A vehicle was blocked
and robbed 25 lakhs away.

95
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:08,927
Any clue?

96
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:12,195
Those gangsters
in the city has to suspected.

97
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,700
Who is in charge of it?

98
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,570
You have to be serious about it.

99
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,042
l am getting frequent calls!

100
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,140
lf there is no pressure
from the top..

101
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,387
..we can control the
goondaism to a certain limit.

102
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:33,217
Your duty is to find out
the cash robbed from the car.

103
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,360
There are able officers to
take care of more important things!

104
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,893
Do you understand that?
-Sir.

105
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:38,722
Every body can go now!

106
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,727
We will meet later,commissioner!

107
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:47,038
Earnest!Call Shanmugam!

108
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,239
l have to see him before l go.

109
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:58,412
What has happened to her?
Any illness?

110
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,083
lt was only a fever!

111
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,119
She was hospitalized
for a few days!

112
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,258
They say the doctors
there made a mistake.

113
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:09,724
They could not diagnose it proper!

114
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,931
lt can be anybody's mistake
but she is gone!

115
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:19,129
We have brought up the
child who is deaf and dumb.

116
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:23,171
lf any thing happen to us
nobody will be for it!

117
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,775
We have come here
to find a way for that.

118
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:31,439
Won't there be any other
orphanage like this?

119
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,778
Please have the tea!
Where is the kid?

120
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,113
She could be there outside!
-She is in the verandah!

121
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,416
Call her here.

122
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:49,161
Are you drawing on the wall?
They are calling you there!

123

They are calling you!
Are you deaf and dumb?

00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,111
What is her name?
-lt is Anna!

127
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:18,786
We have no other way!
We would not desolate her otherwise!

128
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:22,694
l will find some other way!
Baskaran!

129
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,372
You have to call Shanmugam here!

130
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,541
Ask him to come here for a while.
-l'll do that.

131
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,213
Who is this Shanmugam?
-Lower your voice!

132
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,845
Who is this Shanmugam?
-Talk loud!

133
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:40,517
He told me to ask softly!

134
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,687
lt's good for your health
if you ask softly!

135
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:47,154
lf you ask it aloud
he may appear in this bar any moment.

136
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:50,885
There is a democratic setup
and constitutional law here.

137
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:52,557
There is a setup
for law and order here.

138
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,858
What we don't have is a savior for us!

139
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,361
l am a god fearing man!

140
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,366
May be.Have you seen any of the gods..

141
00:13:58,571 --> 00:13:59,868

142
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:04,535
..with no one to help you,
and in those desperate junctures..

00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,582
Shanmugam is one of god's manifestations!

149
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,386
Karickamuri Shanmugam!

Give me that.

158
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,579
Ask him if he is Shanmugam sir!

159
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:55,316
Are you Shanmugam sir?
He says yes! -Give me that.

160
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,764

164
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:15,845
l am Mustafa here.Just a minute.
There is no coverage here.

165
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,309
lf every thing goes well. . ..

00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,610
-What can l do for you,then?
-Brother will decide that.

167
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,617
Give him the wage for his work.

168
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,983
Give us what you feel like!
-Done!

169
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,258
lt's not only the worry
having lost the money for Viswambaran.

170
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:28,325
lt's also shameful for him by that.

We've go to boss!

172
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,331

They are outsiders!
-Who are they?

174
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,625
l will tell that.
-l will give you some money.

175
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,799
We won't get the money
untill the work is completed.

176
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,570
lf he comes to know about that!

177
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,540
Keep it with you!
-l can't take that.

178
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,305
Love is great, not the money!

179
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,638
The complete matter
is in Shanmugam's hands!

180
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,982
Shanmugam is in your hands.

181
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:05,489
You fool Musthafa!
-What is it?

182
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,862
Who is really Shanmugam?

183
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,159
He is our godfather!

184
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,705
He is our way for our daily bread!

185
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,971
Shanmugam is some where in this city.
-lt's now..

186
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:23,014
..he along with his assistant Mammmali..

187
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,174
..go for collection
from the traders in the market.

188
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:42,857
His business is to give out loans
on huge interest rates!

189
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:51,705
Lends 900 Rupees in the morning and
gets back as 1000Rupees in the evening!

190
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,238
Son!Take out the money!

191
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:57,538
Mammmalika!The bank people have
reduced the interest rates.

192
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,876
Won't it affect your company?

193
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:05,220
You can get in low interest rates from
the reserve bank if you need money!

194
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:09,222
Have l come to your house
and told you to borrow money from us?

195
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,419
Take out the money,you slime!

196
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,894
Banker Shanmugam can collect money and..

197
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:16,233
..become richer
by getting elaborate interest!

198
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,904
Shanmugam!My evening prayers to you!

199
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,711
He is the real Pulliyeri!

200
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:40,919
Chop it well and make it to size!

201
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:42,787
What is news brother?

202
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,756
The price of crude oil
has risen in the world market.

203
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,295
Then Sourav Ganguly's
daughter's marriage!

204
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,594
Are they not big things?
Can we without celebrating it?

205
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,134
lt should be.

206
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:55,940
Move away.
Shanmugam sir!

207
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,971
Haven't we acquired
two boats in the sea shore..

208
00:17:59,144 --> 00:17:59,974
..for not getting interest in time?

209
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,544
Arianchal yousuf 's brother Kamal's!

210
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:05,148
He has come now!
There are a few youths with him.

211
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,311
Has he brought the cash with him..

212
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:08,817
..or has he come to see the market?

213
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:12,113
Looks as if he has come to buy something.

214
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,293
Buddy,Kamal,what is news?

215
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,964
l've come to see you!
l was searching for you every where!

216
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:25,467
Have l slipped out
of the hole in your trousers?

217
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,302
lt's you who are hiding from me!

218
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,314
Has Yousuf 's brother
Kamal come there to see you?

219
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,644
There is a weapon in
the waist of his companion Prakash.

220
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,154
lt's okay!

221
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,258
Tell me Kamal!Have you brought the money?

222
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:49,689
l will give that when l get it.

223
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,294
l will sail my boat into the sea today.

224
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,828
l have come to say that.

225
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,192
You have come this far
to say that!

226
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:59,326
You received it in dowry!

227
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:03,497
You can do whatever
you think with the boat!

228
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:13,540
You have come with a blunt knife
to encounter me!

229
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:27,691
Kamal, Oh actor Kamal Hassan!

230
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:32,927
lf you come to me with your prank..

231
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:39,493
..l will tear you apart with this,
take your bowel out..

232
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:46,568
..stuff it with stones and dump
you, in the Kochi backwaters!

233
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,714
So, is he a policeman?
-He is a policeman too.

234
00:20:57,322 --> 00:21:00,723
He was a constant headache
to the policemen in this city.

235
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,950
Shanmugam is there
where there is violence!

236
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:09,066
He used to participate in the criminal
acts like stabbing and hacking!

237
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,126
Has the police whacked him for that?

238
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,064
Yes,for those
who started to do that to him.

239
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,003
Let it explode!

240
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:20,307
lt was then when the
Dy.Sp.Natesan Panicker..

241
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,410
..discovered Shanmugam as
moderately literate with 10th class.

242
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,309
Has he joined him in the police readily?
-Yes he did.

243
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:29,212
Shanmugam is allergic
about wearing khaki.

244
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:33,580
He wears it only on
August 15th and January 26th.

245
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,755
He is in plain clothes forever!

246
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:39,021
Precisely, he equals several Shanmugam!

247
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,165
How long we can be like this using
a mobile number we got from nowhere?

248
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:46,032
Till the day when we
have to die in Shanmugam's hands!

249
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,172
Your damn tongue!

250
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,570
Don't forget what l said!

251
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,576
lf society ignores us
we have no other means. . .

252
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:59,776
..other than fishing for our living.

253
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,911
You can go now!-Ok sir!

254
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:07,352
Who is it?Come.

255
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:12,528
You need not have to salute me!

256
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:17,860
You are wearing Khadi shirt!
l should be careful.

257
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:19,195
For Sabarimala pilgrimage
we have to wear black!

258
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,602
For Palani pilgrimage we have to wear
pink! lt is khadi for the minister!

259
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,335
l don't want to spoil
my name in the politics.

260
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,809
Why do you want to see me?

261
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:31,143
When you've become the minister
and travel in the ministry's car..

262
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:32,212
..you tend to ignore me.

263
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,818
What happened to you now?

264
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,418
Advocate Padaveedan
has ignored me!

265
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,213
Atleast you don't tell about me that.

266
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:40,820
l have not dishonored him at any time!

267
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:44,555
You should prove that
you are a virtuous man.

268
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,823
You could act as the king
or as the minister to me.

269
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,226
You are the same
old Francis to me,who used to sleep..

270
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:52,767
..in the bench in the union office!

271
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,403
lf you happen to misbehave to the
advocate . . .

272
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:57,905
. . .you will not be able to see the cabinet!

273
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,236
He will not let you for that.

274
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:02,746
Sit down and listen
to what l say to you!

275
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,245
You come to a conclusion then.

276
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,245
Let us talk over a few drinks!

277
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,247
l feel bored up,
when l listen to your talk.

278
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:17,089
ArakkeppatVerghese owns the double story
building on M.G.Road.

279
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,195
lt was owned by
Karimannel Chandrappan!

280
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:24,262
They quarreled each other
for not paying the rent.

281
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,931
You vacated Chandrappan
for Verghese to occupy.

282
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,037
l heard you have occupied it.

283
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,944
The business is total loss for Verghese.

284
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:37,108
He don't get the rent or the advance!

285
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,551
You do not allow him
to enter the front yard even.

286
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,154
Aren't these what l said right?

287
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,684
lt is not like that.

288
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:49,691
Verghese have promised me an amount..

289
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,295
..if l vacated him.
He didn't pay me that amount.

290
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,797
Verghese was not holding
the tiger by its tail..

291
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,124
..instead he planted his head
into its mouth.

292
00:23:57,536 --> 00:24:00,061
Verghese was betraying you!
-Don't leave him then!

293
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,830
lt is the eye for an eye!

294
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,640
How is your blade business,Mammali?

295
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:09,578
l don't advise you to lead a
truthful life!

296
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,973
l advise that you should
not lead a disgraceful life!

297
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,319
l didn't call you to advise you.

298
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,513
You have a house now!
ls n't it?

299
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,759
You will have to
allow someone to stay with you.

300
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:28,927
Do you prepare food there
or are you eating food out?

301
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:30,661
There is a woman for doing
the house hold work!

302
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,100
She is not permanent!
She comes only if l need her work!

303
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:41,141
Who can be that? -lt could be
some terrorist who need a hiding place.

304
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,174
Terrorist is your father. Come

305
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:48,549
She is the one.

306
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:54,615
The reason why she is not
responding our presence..

307
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,421
..or to our talk is that
she is deaf and dumb!

308
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,861
Will she be a burden for you?

309
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:06,128
l am used to obey
whatever you say!

310
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:09,901
l can not say for how
long she has to be with you!

311
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:17,210
Come.

312
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,317
You didn't say who she is!

313
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:37,164
Years ago when l got you
l didn't know who you were!

314
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,068
There was nobody
to tell me who you are.

315
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,434
Mammmali!Asan is always
in the party office. . .

316
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:16,564
. . .yet he is aware of things
happening around!

317
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:19,107
Haven't you heard him
talking about this property?

318
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:22,378
He has spies all over!

319
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,275
Even the children in this town
are aware of this story!

320
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:27,441
You have done such a great job.

321
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:32,222
lf anybody tries to play with me
The consequence will be grave!

322
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,062
ls the painting here not yet over?

323
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:39,723
The finishing work is not good.

324
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,188
The paint was not of quality.
lt was to returned to the dealer!

325
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,867
He bought it for half the price
and did the painting work.

326
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:48,328
lf an account is given the painting work
you can't expect a better finish.

327
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,201
Who is the account?
-l am the one!

328
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:54,877
Are n't you a literate
to say accountant?

329
00:26:55,747 --> 00:27:00,150
-l am doing my work sincerely
with whatever knowledge l have. -Yes.

330
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,147
Why is she standing outside?

331
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,155
Take her inside.

332
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:09,423
Come in child.

333
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:13,427
She can't hear you!
-l give her sign to come in.

334
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,773
What is her name?
-Anna something. . .

335
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,774
You can't call her by her name!

336
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:28,910
She will know
only by signs!

337
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:32,273
Her face looks very familiar to me
if l look at her.

338
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:36,113
She is too young
to have seen by you!

339
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:38,017
Go, you pig!
-Come in.

340
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,356
ls Veronica woman not there?

341
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:42,685
This kid has to eat something!

342
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:46,693
l have to see that woman's face too.

343
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:26,297
Why do you look at me like that?

344
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:29,903
What are you thinking?
Tell me.

345
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:34,768
Nothing . . .that l have brought you up here
to make you suffer!

346
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:44,117
You have lived a luxurious life,
with every thing!

347
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:48,183
You are a dear one there
and l have brought you here..

348
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,753
..to wash and press others' clothes!

349
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:52,194
You have brought me up here..

350
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,197
..and have not discarded me
after wards!

351
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,999
You are respecting me
and looks after me as your wife.

352
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:01,696
You just mind your work!

353
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,668
We have work only till noon.

354
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,940
We go to a hotel and have biriyani!

355
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:08,544
We will go for a matinee show
for a movie of Vijay!

356
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,006
Anandam!-She is calling you!

357
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,679
l want these clothes
to be pressed and fast.-Ok.

358
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,433
What Elumalai?
Are you fine?

359
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,367
Yes,sir!-Why is your wife
scared when she sees me?

360
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,430
Tell her l am not
the one to eat up girls!

361
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:39,033
Poor thing!She hasn't seen
her birth place well.

362
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:40,902
She has come to the
city side for the first time.

363
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,643
See you!

364
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:48,049
Arrogant fellow!

365
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:52,484
l know that.l wish l could
press his face with this iron.

366
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,991
Why do we need problems
that are unwanted?

367
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:59,859
You go and sit in the shadow!
We shall start soon.

368
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:10,001
Who is it?-l am Shanmugam!

369
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,501
l was asked to come here.

370
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:22,950
You can come in.

371
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,597
l was not sure
whether you will come.

372
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:49,496
lt's good that you have not forgotten me!

373
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,901
l have forgotten many.

374
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,308
l have not heard cries of many!

375
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:55,377
ln your case. . .

376
00:31:56,981 --> 00:32:00,849
l have not harmed any students
at any time.

377
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:03,185
lt has happened then,
l don't know how!

378
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,320
l'm not asking you to forgive me!

379
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:11,459
You wanted to see me
and l am here!

380
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,121
lf it is a help that you need from me..

381
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,791
..l will do it for you if l can!

382
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,132
lt is your help that l need now.

383
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,966
Ashok is the new inspector
of your station.

384
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,474
He is my younger brother!

385
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,807
He is young and very active!

386
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,613
You should not take it seriously
if any problems arise.

387
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:32,679
l have heard of him.

388
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:34,083
l have not seen him so far!

389
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:35,215
l will take care of him!

390
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:39,685
He is short tempered
which can lead him to trouble.

391
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:42,559
l can take care of him
if he is under my scrutiny!

392
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:46,295
He is very glamorous!

393
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,322
Can't he get a better job than this?

394
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,831
He is unique

395
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:54,433
The other day he thrashed
3 or 4 eve-teasers in Pallimukku!

396
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:55,665
He has beaten them to pulp!

397
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:57,504
He is young, that is why!

398
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,775
He is asking for you
since he took charge!

399
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,509
He may want to meet me!
l am a famous guy!

400
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:03,840
We have not met before!

401
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:06,349
l had a chapter about you to study..

402
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:08,041
..in the training college!

403
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,754
You are our example
for the unwanted qualities..

404
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:13,220
..for a policeman!

405
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,988
You look very stylish!

406
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,026
ls your dress designed by yourself?

407
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:21,862
l have a little American touch!

408
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,863
l used to watch American
movies since l was young!

409
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:25,558
My hero was Clint Eastwood!

410
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,068
ls your job in the American Police?

411
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:28,068
No, it is here.

412
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:29,202
Here we have an uniform
for the police..

413
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:30,534
..decided by the government.

414
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:31,538
lt looks very weary!

415
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:34,704
lt's irritable to even see
the khaki dress of here.

416
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:37,210
That doesn't mean
we can wear what we like.

417
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:40,680
We have a style of our own!

418
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:42,886
Your style can be
to your wife!

419
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,383
l am not married,but single.

420
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,690
From tomorrow,
like others..

421
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:51,224
..you have to come in time
to the station in uniform.

422
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:55,594
You have to work sincerely
here as long as l am here!

423
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,226
Have you understood?

424
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:00,161
lt's long since l am in this setup!

425
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,397
lt is very difficult
for me to change now,sir.

426
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,972
l am not a permanent visitor
to this place.

427
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:06,937
When l heard that
a new officer has come..

428
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,772
..l wanted to see him,
and that's all.

429
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:10,106
Shall l leave then sir?

430
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:22,248
Stay there.l will tell
when you can come out.

431
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,920
You should have
told me before you hit me.

432
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:31,428
Oh dullard sir!
ls it a marriage in your house!

433
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:44,944
POLlCE STATlON
KASABA.

434
00:34:56,828 --> 00:35:01,026
Give your hand buddy!
Bye!

435
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:07,636
Bye sir!

436
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,812
lt is Ashok here!
l am coming.

437
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:20,475
l have to go to my brother's house!

438
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:21,776
l may have food from there.

439
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,783
l am serious.
There is no liquor!

440
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:28,120
Will you be quiet?
Go ahead, l will call you!

441
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:33,990
l know that.
Why are you here?

442
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,170
l have come to see you!

443
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:46,002
We could not get
to know each other well ..

444
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,837
..amidst the struggle in the morning.

445
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:50,843
l have come to know you very well.

446
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,879
Your ultimate influence
have helped in it.

447
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,686
l am a helper to those
in the department..

448
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,014
..as well as in the politics.

449
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:01,356
l will be useful in certain situations!

450
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,053
l will be with you too.

451
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,024
l have no particular reason for that!

452
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:10,533
lf you want anybody's heart,if not mine..

453
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:14,196
..l can give it on a platter!

454
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:16,433
You have to be
in accord with me for that.

455
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:20,540
Don't threaten me!
l am also brought up in this city.

456
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:23,038
l know you have threatened
those in the other station.

457
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:25,909
lt was a pastime for you.

458
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,715
You need not have
to come in that route.

459
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,550
lf you want to work under me
you should..

460
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,915
..obey my orders
and to my plans!

461
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:34,224
lt's difficult for me!
-Then leave this job and go away.

462
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:37,883
lt is better if you were
transferred to some alien station.

463
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:40,862
This station is under
my control too.

464
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:42,891
You have to be only
within the circle and play.

465
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:49,536
A full bottle of brandy,
2 chicken biriyani..

466
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:52,605
..and beedi with
good quality tobacco in it.

467
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,936
That was my wage!

468
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:57,405
For those who were in accord with me..

469
00:36:57,648 --> 00:37:00,276
..l entered the college campus
and stabbed a student.

470
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:03,753
When l saw him today morning
in his wheel chair..

471
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:05,780
..l felt sorry for him.

472
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:10,283
He has told about you to me.
He requested me to take care of you.

473
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:14,096
That's why l came
to see you in the station!

474
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,296
You greeted me
by kicking me in the back.

475
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,762
The legs of those who
kicked me from front and back..

476
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:20,937
..are in a poor condition now!

477
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:24,604
We have to meet again
in the station or elsewhere.

478
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:26,432
Please leave me alone!

479
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:32,108
l don't want you in a wheel chair
like your brother!

480
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:34,640
See you then!

481
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:16,483
Damn her!She can't hear a thing.

482
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:20,656
Will your dad give the money
to paint the wall..

483
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:21,832
..if you make it dirty?

484
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,158
l will give you a whack!
Don't weep!

485
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:28,303
l told you not to weep!

486
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,734
My God! Are you trying
to hit that dumb girl to death?

487
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,240
You old woman!
You are telling lie!

488
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,241
l have not hit her!
-Why is she crying then?

489
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,004
Where were you all this time?

490
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:38,681
See what she has done there.
-Kids are like that.

491
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:39,883
She is not mine!

492
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:42,849
She may be some body's
but she is a human!

493
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,647
You will get the wrath
if you try..

494
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:45,652
..to harm a poor deaf and dumb girl.

495
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,224
l will endure that.
Take her away! -Come dear!

496
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:50,758
Has she spoiled the wall made of marble..

497
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:51,758
..of this palace?

498
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,328
l am going to build
a palace like the one you said.

499
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:55,531
When you are dead
you will be laid in the coffin..

500
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,064
..and buried in that palce!

501
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:59,728
You had no fortune to attend
your mom's funeral!

502
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:01,905
You do that after l die!

503
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:09,876
Ask him if he is Shanmugam sir!

504
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:11,241
You ask him.

505
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:14,015
You ask him. You've to get
to know each other sooner or later.

506
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,222
Are you Shanmugam sir?
-l am driving a vehicle,you pig!

507
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,723
-He is driving! -Ok!
We will call him later!

508
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:25,896
Did you get the matter, sir?

509
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:28,065
They are importing men and..

510
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:29,596
..we have to do the same for us!

511
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:32,065
lf they create trouble?
-We will have to do the same!

512
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:33,634
Buddy has told us to go to ldukki
and bring Aadu Thoma..

513
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,567
..and Keeri kadan!

514
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:37,797
l have heard those names before!

515
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,602
They are very famous!

516
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,411
Give us some money or our expenses.

517
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:45,775
Ofcourse,ldukki is very far off.
-Give it to him!

518
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,917
l hope you will let me
know at the earliest.

519
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:48,148
Not at all.

520
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,480
We will call you from Kottayam!
-lt is not Kottayam!lt is ldukki!

521
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:51,916
Whatever it is.
-See you then!

522
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:53,754
He is foolish enough
and l wonder how foolish..

523
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:56,324
..his boss Viswambaran will be!

524
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:59,088
He is a fool,that he had to lose
his 25 lakh Rupees to some one.

525
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:03,091
Kerala. Tomorrow's Kerala.

526
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:04,595
The lucky one is being selected.

527
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:07,430
Sir, tomorrow's Kerala.

528
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:10,501
By considering the
situation of today's Kerala.

529
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:12,972
Dear friend, l don't see a
good scope for tomorrow's Kerala

530
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,271
One cannot predict,
how luck is going to come?

531
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:17,447
Just now luck went in a car.

532
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:18,774
Dear friend, please leave us.

533
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,615
Sarala, my dear Sarala,
There wont be any trouble!

534
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,618
l don't want.
-lt is Babu who is assuring it!

535
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:26,346
l don't want to listen to
it. l will not come with you.

536
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:27,320
-Nothing will happen
-l can't. l will not come.

537
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:28,755
There wont be any trouble!

538
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,678
Don't go, stop. There is a passenger.
-lt is not for hire.

539
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,477
lt is drawn tomorrow.

540
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:51,544
What was that problem?

541
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,649
ls it husband and wife dispute
or is it innocent troubles in love?

542
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:54,851
lt is nothing of that sort. He is Babu.

543
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,350
He is called dog Babu.
-Which variety?

544
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:58,150
lf it is translated in mother tongue!

545
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:02,223
The chain, rope, uncle, mum etc, which
connects the prostitutes with clients.

546
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:04,155
-That is enough.
-Then let us go.

547
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:11,532
The five fates are seen
in the horoscope

548
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:18,208
This hand has the luck to be at a far
away place leaving the native and home.

549
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,843
Abounding the royal life like a queen.

550
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,239
This period makes to live as one wishes

551
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:25,871
By facing the hurdles
and experiencing it.

552
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:29,678
But at the meeting point
of lucky line and life line.

553
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:32,013
l see a problem

554
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:36,049
Your lose and hurdles will get vanished
and good fortune is going to replace it.

555
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:38,195
-That is enough.
-Ok.

556
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:57,740
Wait.

557
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:00,042
l have seen you somewhere?
What is your name?

558
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:01,546
Anandam

559
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:04,054
Anandam Paramanandam
(happiness, great happiness)!

560
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:06,388
She should be bathed with green pears.

561
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,058
lf she is applied twice!

562
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:16,395
Even after getting all
this, you wont speak out.

563
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:21,263
Who is Karadi(bear)Biju?
ls he your father?

564
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:22,639
One thing l would like to tell you.

565
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:26,739
Those influential person will
not reach here to rescue you.

566
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:28,806
l will free you only
after physical torturing!

567
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:30,605
l will make tell it before that.

568
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:34,614
Who stole the money
and where is his hideout?

569
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:47,588
You could have dealt with him softly!

570
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:51,627
They are harmful, if they spot
you outside then they shall backfire it.

571
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:53,097
l am ready to get it.

572
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,261
You concentrate on your work.

573
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:55,904
lf you harm your physic then
no one be there to assist you.

574
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,940
One has to live for many years isn't it?

575
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:00,599
That is alright. l am
not expecting your help.

576
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:03,379
Devakara, don't give
them a single drop of water.

577
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:04,781
lf any one enquires about me.

578
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,040
Then you and others
aren't aware of where l am.

579
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:07,150
-Did you understand that?
-Yes sir.

580
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,786
The meat will get soiled!

581
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,926
lt is time for a change in attitude
of the past policing by torture!

582
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:22,126
Third degree treatment will not yield
any result from these type of people.

583
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,467
They have courage because
someone is their to protect them.

584
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:25,966
That adds will power to them

585
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,467
lt is the police who beat the youth.

586
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,267
With and without reason
and made them seasoned.

587
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,601
Hits are not enough for them.

588
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,572
Like Bombay, goondas act
should be implemented here.

589
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:34,973
A bullet per head.

590
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:36,976
This city can be cleansed within a day.

591
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:40,813
Uthopian! Our social
conditions are not like Bombay.

592
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:43,476
Treatment is need for disease and
not for indication of that disease.

593
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:46,985
The scene changed after the
politicians started using them.

594
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:49,751
These people converted politics into a
business that is the curse of this country.

595
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:53,163
Whatever is converted into business,
there growth should be the ultimate.

596
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:55,995
Their concentration
will be only on its returns!

597
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:57,830
Any method for that.

598
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,031
Who entered into kitchen? ls it Manu?

599
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:07,176
No, the tea was
prepared by our inspector.

600
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,836
Then it is sure, he
might not switched off the gas.

601
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,505
You go and have a look. l have even
washed the breakfasted eaten plates.

602
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:13,679
ls it?

603
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,848
l never expected you here!

604
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:20,857
You have forgotten
the importance of this day.

605
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:22,021
What?

606
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:24,352
Your mind is filled
with politicians and goondas

607
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:26,222
Then many unwanted things are present.

608
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:27,193
Sheela, what is the matter?

609
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,526
lt is the day, you used
to visit a person with flowers.

610
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:37,372
l am forgetting every thing.

611
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:39,371
That is alright.

612
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:42,238
You may go.
We shall wait for you at lunch.

613
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:47,213
Regarding whom, they
were talking about meeting?

614
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:50,252
Betty, that our Asokans. . .
it is her memorial day.

615
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:01,564
Where did you get the thing.
That too on the first of the month!

616
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:03,596
What is this question?

617
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:05,731
l used to drink only
on the first of every month.

618
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:07,904
One is interested in it
when there is no supply of it.

619
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:09,439
Pour into a glass and have it.

620
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:11,437
l don't know when he will be here.

621
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:15,076
lf l get a beating from
a S.l who is my son's age!

622
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:18,577
Please hold this.

623
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:24,250
Yes, what is the matter?

624
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:26,986
Where?

625
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:30,258
Which is the team?

626
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:33,121
You get in contact with him by phone.

627
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:35,931
You get in contact with
him by phone and block him.

628
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:37,630
What his phone is switched off?

629
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:38,931
Which is that place?

630
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,888
l had already told you in Malayalam.
But you never listened to it.

631
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:52,259
lf you hurt and make bleed one
among those who wakes to kill or die.

632
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:53,232
Then they wont leave you.

633
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:54,734
They will be hiding like
this in darkness and hideout.

634
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:55,668
l shall drop you, come with me.

635
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:58,240
No, thanks. l can go
myself. l have my vehicle.

636
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,243
But your timing is really great.

637
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:03,070
This place and this quotation.

638
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:05,741
Who is informing
your perfectly about this?

639
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:08,077
l came to help you but it
turned to be troublesome for me!

640
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:09,945
Who will call
and inform this to me?

641
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,744
l was not suppose
to pass through this way.

642
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:14,356
lt was a short cut
so l turned then!

643
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:17,425
Ok, then we shall
meet on such short cuts.

644
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:19,562
You need not adopt
this paths to meet me.

645
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,755
You may get lost and
will not reach back home in time.

646
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:23,099
Then l shall take leave.

647
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:31,604
Shanmugam's help, cooperation,
if it is with our department.

648
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:34,940
lsn't it Asoka? We
can do many good things.

649
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:42,947
A beautiful dream city without thieves
and rowdies cannot be created in a day.

650
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:48,584
But the biggest problem faced
by this city is hired hit men.

651
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:54,126
The rich can use it against anyone.

652
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:57,327
They can hack others hands,
legs or head and collect money.

653
00:48:57,968 --> 00:48:59,458
They needn't pay
back the borrowed money.

654
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:01,800
They can be used for
killing and for their growth.

655
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:07,507
Tell me. You know
the pulse of the slum.

656
00:49:07,844 --> 00:49:10,972
lf you decide than
we can do many things.

657
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:13,843
l like both of you.

658
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:18,151
That means you do your assigned
duty perfectly for the given remuneration

659
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:19,819
But l don't belong to that category.

660
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:22,825
l became a police
for their satisfaction!

661
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:28,559
As you mention the city's slum. lt
was there l was born and brought up.

662
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:38,670
l still have a dark memory.

663
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:42,008
With those tiny legs when l was 3 years..

664
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,007
..l was not aware who my parents are!

665
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:45,847
l wondered who
abandoned me here!

666
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:50,645
l wondered who my relation ships are!

667
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:52,354
l didn't have a name for me to call.

668
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:56,649
ln Vathuruthi colony
there was a beggar who was a leper!

669
00:49:56,827 --> 00:50:00,024
..A tamil who has fed me
till l was 6 year old.

670
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:03,528
He called me as Shanmugan!

671
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:05,364
After his death,
l started begging!

672
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:09,861
One day l was caught up for
picking pockets in the bus stand!

673
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:13,700
l was beaten up by the police!

674
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:16,202
He broke the born of my left leg!

675
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,371
l was wandering like
a street dog with sore legs.

676
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:21,717
lt was Asaan who provided me food..

677
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:24,051
..and entered me in the school.

678
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:26,245
l consider him as my Godfather!

679
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:33,718
l have bowed only before him
and listened to his words.

680
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:36,065
None other than him
could alter Shanmugam!

681
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:41,730
You sirs can leave me alone!

682
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:49,238
There are those
who live in the darkness of life.

683
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:53,480
They are starved and
they steal food from shops.

684
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:55,913
They eat whatever
they get from there.

685
00:50:56,119 --> 00:51:01,284
Then there are the rogues!
They are not born to rogues.

686
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:04,427
They are stamped rogues
by those politicians

00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:07,427
liquor business men and
blade businessmen by bribing them!

688
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:09,087
Then there are those
who are devilish like!

689
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:13,599
They are born to kill people
for their living!

690
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:15,403

..from the deadly weapons!

695
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:34,451
You shouldn't go alone
to trap those deadly people unarmed.

696
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:37,459
They will pack you up
and send you to an alien place.

697
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:46,630
No,sir!lnside him,
he is miserable and wounded.

709
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:54,063

710
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:57,365

There will be boozing
rounds by the younger people!

713
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:05,539
We will just peep in and come off!

714
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:07,649
You tell them that l am your friend!

715
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:09,910
Ok,you can come with me!
Do you like to have a drink before that?

716
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:13,053
Not one, but two! We can

717
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,653
This seems to be heading for trouble!
