1
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:25,635
People's investigation wing has
released a report stating that

2
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:28,902
the firing of 13 people in ***
is a malicious murder.

3
00:01:29,373 --> 00:01:34,046
13 were gunned down in a police firing in a
protest against the functioning of ***.

4
00:01:34,213 --> 00:01:35,768
Retired Judges

5
00:01:35,925 --> 00:01:37,868
The press and other media
are blowing the issue.

6
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,991
It will result in anti incumbency.

7
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:42,792
I ordered this shootout

8
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,034
to make sure that people
wouldn't protest again.

9
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,178
I'm familiar with the people of Tamil Nadu.

10
00:01:47,592 --> 00:01:48,915
Now they have grouped
for this issue...

11
00:01:49,144 --> 00:01:51,920
If we cause hindrance for
a star's movie release...

12
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
they will protest for that too

13
00:01:53,803 --> 00:01:55,675
This is their limitation

14
00:01:55,874 --> 00:01:57,370
Hence... go fetch me the nuts

15
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,370
- Aye!
- Scoot

16
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:08,089
Sir...

17
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,353
Where shall I keep
these statues?

18
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,428
Stock them in madam's room.

19
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:17,969
The statues are exquisite

20
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:19,049
Where did you get it?

21
00:02:20,528 --> 00:02:22,247
I was invited as a chief guest
for a ceremony in museum...

22
00:02:22,606 --> 00:02:23,990
these statues were cast aside

23
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,765
So I bailed them out here.

24
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,990
I love you

25
00:02:30,432 --> 00:02:31,432
What's it?

26
00:02:32,128 --> 00:02:33,128
Hey...

27
00:02:33,685 --> 00:02:35,026
I ordered the shoot out.

28
00:02:35,315 --> 00:02:36,762
You are talking about the news?

29
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:38,605
People may take me for a clown

30
00:02:39,312 --> 00:02:40,820
But as long our allies are in power

31
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:42,541
No one...

32
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:43,950
For that matter...

33
00:02:44,324 --> 00:02:46,742
Even the Yama (God of death)
will not dare to touch me.

34
00:06:47,192 --> 00:06:48,454
First of the three monarchs...

35
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:50,276
Emperor of the 14 worlds...

36
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:51,962
Justice who weighs the deeds

37
00:06:52,299 --> 00:06:53,564
Head of 'Siva Gotra'

38
00:06:53,855 --> 00:06:55,219
Our beloved Yama Dharma Raja

39
00:06:55,411 --> 00:06:57,535
Here he strides!!!

40
00:07:05,948 --> 00:07:06,948
Greetings, leader.

41
00:07:09,557 --> 00:07:10,557
Mister...

42
00:07:11,816 --> 00:07:12,953
Mister...
- What's it?

43
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:15,711
We are dead...

44
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:17,513
and are brought to the world of lord Yama

45
00:07:17,856 --> 00:07:19,241
What happens when they die?

46
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:20,743
To which world will they be taken to?

47
00:07:21,168 --> 00:07:26,174
I'm totally scared about
the sentence for my sins...

48
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:29,104
But here you are tormenting my soul...

49
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,685
Our souls have already been liberated.
Why worry now?

50
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:34,510
What's your earthly sin?

51
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,180
that's making you so
scared of the judgment?

52
00:07:36,343 --> 00:07:39,454
I was the Judge who had
passed many judgments.

53
00:07:42,925 --> 00:07:45,054
I wanted to ask this, my lord.

54
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:48,216
You were dragging the mace

55
00:07:48,376 --> 00:07:50,517
- Why?
- Senility

56
00:07:50,955 --> 00:07:52,676
I could not carry it over my shoulders

57
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:54,999
So I dragged it along

58
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,279
This is too trivial, Chitragupta

59
00:07:57,572 --> 00:07:58,572
Forgive me, my lord.

60
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:02,373
Today's death count on earth is 22, 237.

61
00:08:02,663 --> 00:08:05,007
List out their virtuousness and sins.

62
00:08:05,502 --> 00:08:06,998
I shall pass the judgment

63
00:08:11,318 --> 00:08:12,870
Dare you not.
I'm the minister of law.

64
00:08:12,973 --> 00:08:13,973
I know the technicalities as well.

65
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:15,785
Greetings, leader.

66
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,700
He has outlawed and
committed innumerable sins

67
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,721
despite being a minister of law

68
00:08:20,554 --> 00:08:22,430
His acts have cost many lives

69
00:08:23,113 --> 00:08:24,113
Chitragupta!

70
00:08:24,343 --> 00:08:26,105
I've told you this oftentimes

71
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:29,654
Politicians are our
uncrowned representatives

72
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:34,192
Alike the tsunami and earthquakes,
they are responsible for mass deaths.

73
00:08:34,997 --> 00:08:36,764
They are making our jobs easier.

74
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:40,225
But, my lord even the
innocents are the victims here.

75
00:08:40,225 --> 00:08:41,840
- Who are innocents?
- You hit the nail.

76
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:45,016
Lured by the money and position

77
00:08:45,204 --> 00:08:48,308
they trade votes for money.
How can you call them innocents?

78
00:08:50,606 --> 00:08:51,773
Imbeciles

79
00:08:52,337 --> 00:08:54,171
They are the offenders.

80
00:08:56,349 --> 00:08:58,961
It's because of the
people who never intend to

81
00:08:59,124 --> 00:09:00,755
be rational in understanding things,

82
00:09:00,914 --> 00:09:03,296
such people get appointed
as the ministers.

83
00:09:03,551 --> 00:09:05,093
Awesome!

84
00:09:05,272 --> 00:09:06,468
I like your propaganda

85
00:09:06,692 --> 00:09:09,748
Let me be your voice of propaganda.

86
00:09:09,954 --> 00:09:10,892
I work to the fullest.

87
00:09:10,892 --> 00:09:13,732
One with no policy needs
a voice of propaganda

88
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:15,316
Correct

89
00:09:15,364 --> 00:09:17,835
Where do you wish to go?
Heaven or hell?

90
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:19,447
Petals or thorns?

91
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:20,924
Petals, my lord.

92
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,058
Oh angels...

93
00:09:22,202 --> 00:09:23,218
Escort him.

94
00:09:23,352 --> 00:09:26,646
I will make sure that no
water body in heaven gets drained

95
00:09:26,836 --> 00:09:28,537
I will cover them
up with thermocol

96
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,710
Wait for me in the street corner.
I shall pick you up.

97
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,282
Please take a break if
you are feeling unwell

98
00:09:34,855 --> 00:09:36,290
We shall postpone the
cases for tomorrow

99
00:09:36,578 --> 00:09:40,492
I got addicted to the tobacco after
getting used to the human behaviour.

100
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:43,018
That's the reason for the cough.
Nothing serious.

101
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,347
Or can we adjourn the
court for a short period.

102
00:09:45,556 --> 00:09:46,556
Not necessary, Chitragupta

103
00:09:46,749 --> 00:09:49,042
The human cycle of life and death

104
00:09:49,354 --> 00:09:50,354
shouldn't halt

105
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:52,303
That's the law of the nature

106
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,309
The court proceedings shouldn't
be interrupted for my cause

107
00:09:54,404 --> 00:09:57,237
I'll make announcement
in this regards

108
00:09:58,506 --> 00:10:00,110
- Regarding?
- What do you presume?

109
00:10:00,606 --> 00:10:03,021
It's about my permanent retirement

110
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,680
What?

111
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:06,358
Permanent retirement?

112
00:10:11,605 --> 00:10:12,605
Chitragupta...

113
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:16,129
The booze party is very luring

114
00:10:16,354 --> 00:10:17,735
What's the occasion?

115
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:20,440
Is it mandatory that
former should follow the latter?

116
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,670
What I meant is...

117
00:10:21,994 --> 00:10:23,431
We are curious because
you are serving it.

118
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:24,776
Hence we are asking.

119
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:26,483
This feast is for the victory.

120
00:10:26,685 --> 00:10:27,843
I don't get it.

121
00:10:28,072 --> 00:10:30,926
- I got it.
- And what's that?

122
00:10:31,245 --> 00:10:38,371
Lord Yama will announce his
successor with your counsel.

123
00:10:40,002 --> 00:10:43,616
That's why he was making
an eye contact with you.

124
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:45,023
Isn't it?

125
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:50,183
If you talk rubbish,
I'll thrash you hard.

126
00:10:51,348 --> 00:10:54,967
- It's picture perfect for me.
- And what do you see?

127
00:10:55,184 --> 00:10:56,184
The thing is...

128
00:10:56,496 --> 00:10:57,571
You are to be...

129
00:10:58,094 --> 00:11:01,691
Tomorrow.... announced in the court

130
00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:05,564
Bingo!

131
00:11:05,808 --> 00:11:08,358
My yearning of thousand years...

132
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,452
My dream is going to be true..
And just that thought is

133
00:11:12,742 --> 00:11:15,376
making me feel 'I'm on cloud nine.'

134
00:11:15,685 --> 00:11:16,685
You are supposed to feel

135
00:11:17,183 --> 00:11:18,183
And...

136
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,321
As a part of the acting committee

137
00:11:20,678 --> 00:11:25,150
When asked for your opinion,
you must bring my traits to the table

138
00:11:25,297 --> 00:11:27,499
 and vouch for me.

139
00:11:27,815 --> 00:11:29,930
You are uttering non sense.

140
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:34,211
There is no one here to
challenge your stature.

141
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,462
Let the truth speaks for itself.

142
00:11:35,606 --> 00:11:37,922
Hail tomorrow's lord Yama.

143
00:11:37,995 --> 00:11:39,320
Long live the lord

144
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,099
The king of generosity.

145
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:46,718
Hail tomorrow's lord Yama.

146
00:11:46,718 --> 00:11:48,354
Long live the lord

147
00:11:48,573 --> 00:11:51,610
- Hail eternal lord Yama.
- Long live the lord

148
00:12:11,808 --> 00:12:12,897
What's it, my lord?

149
00:12:13,468 --> 00:12:15,042
Seems that you are
lost in your thoughts.

150
00:12:15,424 --> 00:12:16,424
Indeed, Ayyo.

151
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:19,602
Who would be the ideal
successor for my position?

152
00:12:19,933 --> 00:12:24,182
I'm scrutinizing every person in the court.

153
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:27,313
What's this new twist to the tale?

154
00:12:28,028 --> 00:12:29,966
When we have our son

155
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:33,614
why worry about others?

156
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:37,362
The only thing that doesn't
match you, is your outfits

157
00:12:37,564 --> 00:12:40,753
He is on par with you on everything else

158
00:12:41,566 --> 00:12:43,154
Your son?

159
00:12:43,408 --> 00:12:44,970
No, someone else's son.

160
00:12:45,647 --> 00:12:46,647
What sort of question is this?

161
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,933
Indeed our son.

162
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:50,742
What qualities and traits does
he have to make the claim?

163
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:52,978
Isn't the rightful heir not
enough to make the claim?

164
00:12:52,978 --> 00:12:54,687
Is being my son a merit?

165
00:12:57,414 --> 00:13:00,006
Are the people of merit
holding the positions here?

166
00:13:00,241 --> 00:13:03,027
The lucky ones and the slaves
are holding the position

167
00:13:11,378 --> 00:13:15,911
I fear that you will land
me in troubled waters.

168
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,791
Isn't this your unfamiliar territory?

169
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:21,431
My lord!

170
00:13:21,476 --> 00:13:24,284
If you are worried about
the wise successor...

171
00:13:24,618 --> 00:13:27,271
Who else other than your blood?

172
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:29,393
Mark my words.

173
00:13:30,572 --> 00:13:32,455
No matter who dies...

174
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,278
- We shall be the executioner.
- Great!

175
00:13:35,966 --> 00:13:40,007
No matter who dies...
We shall be the executioner.

176
00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:42,767
How benevolent?

177
00:13:43,992 --> 00:13:46,035
But is the nepotism right?

178
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:48,911
Only until out heir holds the reign

179
00:13:49,082 --> 00:13:51,041
we can have the authority.

180
00:13:56,485 --> 00:13:57,485
Lord...

181
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,514
I shall be either the wife of the lord...

182
00:14:01,004 --> 00:14:02,004
Or...

183
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:03,943
The mother of the lord Yama.

184
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,113
Make a wiser decision

185
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:15,974
I have ruled this world of Yama
for more than  0.15 million years

186
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:20,062
This throne demands a fresh blood

187
00:14:20,062 --> 00:14:21,062
That's me.

188
00:14:21,163 --> 00:14:24,628
I have decided to step aside
and make a way for the youth

189
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,876
As per the decision of working
and decision making committee

190
00:14:30,518 --> 00:14:31,518
My son

191
00:14:32,473 --> 00:14:36,130
will be my successor

192
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:38,499
I'm gladfully announcing
this sweet news to the court

193
00:14:39,302 --> 00:14:42,616
You feasted on my drinks

194
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,206
and voted for his son?

195
00:14:45,692 --> 00:14:46,692
Traitors!

196
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,762
It's not the decision of the committee
but his family's

197
00:14:49,762 --> 00:14:50,877
Dear ministers

198
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,101
I presume you are happy about it.

199
00:14:53,264 --> 00:14:55,795
Indeed delighted, my lord

200
00:14:56,074 --> 00:14:57,990
If not your charming son

201
00:14:58,469 --> 00:15:04,536
none in this world is best
qualified to sit on the throne

202
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:08,885
You were showering praises
for me the last night

203
00:15:09,112 --> 00:15:12,139
Chitragupta, what's the small talk?

204
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:13,867
Since the ages

205
00:15:14,063 --> 00:15:15,805
we are relying on you

206
00:15:16,114 --> 00:15:17,630
Don't we have a promotion

207
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:18,973
Fool!!

208
00:15:19,156 --> 00:15:21,223
You have a permanent place in my heart.

209
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:23,361
You are the apple of my eye.

210
00:15:24,955 --> 00:15:25,955
Messenger!
- Yes, my lord!

211
00:15:26,588 --> 00:15:30,791
- Escort my handsome son from world of Indra.
- Aye

212
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,749
(Reciting Kural)

213
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:45,728
Desire the Almighty, the desire-less

214
00:15:46,107 --> 00:15:48,387
In order to renounce other desires...

215
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,222
desire that desire.

216
00:15:55,305 --> 00:15:57,823
Sathi, wake Mr. Ingenious.

217
00:15:58,247 --> 00:15:59,739
Mate!!

218
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:03,236
Don't act filmy!
What's it?

219
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,454
Master is calling you.

220
00:16:04,535 --> 00:16:05,683
Answer his call.

221
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,648
He is calling you.

222
00:16:07,954 --> 00:16:09,705
Why is he calling me?

223
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:11,679
Greetings, master.

224
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:14,585
Your father is tormenting human souls.

225
00:16:15,137 --> 00:16:17,165
Here you are tormenting me.

226
00:16:17,381 --> 00:16:19,263
You are dozing off in my class.

227
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:23,904
Which is your favourite verse?

228
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:27,202
My favorite one is of actor T.Rajender's

229
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,183
- Rajender?
- Indeed, bro.

230
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:30,759
Who is that?

231
00:16:30,911 --> 00:16:31,911
You don't know him?

232
00:16:32,317 --> 00:16:35,078
He is known for his
dialogues in the planet earth

233
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,073
He is equally good in songs

234
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,497
He can't keep talking for
the whole day void any breaks

235
00:16:39,497 --> 00:16:42,054
There is a tribute song as well.

236
00:16:42,238 --> 00:16:45,135
(Sings a Tamil song)

237
00:16:58,808 --> 00:17:00,760
Stop it, moron.

238
00:17:01,003 --> 00:17:02,521
-  I wasn't talking about that.
- What?

239
00:17:02,716 --> 00:17:04,489
Recite any Kural.

240
00:17:04,697 --> 00:17:07,104
Better you contact the writer.
I have absolutely no idea.

241
00:17:07,104 --> 00:17:08,861
I'm the writer.

242
00:17:10,634 --> 00:17:12,583
Did he crack a joke?

243
00:17:12,776 --> 00:17:14,135
Zip up, plastic face.

244
00:17:14,747 --> 00:17:20,134
Humans beautifully recite
all the 1330 verses.

245
00:17:20,363 --> 00:17:23,472
Here you are tormenting just
you have the backing of lord Yama

246
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:27,938
I agree that humans
recite your verses

247
00:17:28,139 --> 00:17:31,082
But they don't stick to the ideology.

248
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:35,525
If you don't trust me,
I will persuade my father

249
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:38,572
to send you to earth and
you can examine yourself.

250
00:17:38,572 --> 00:17:41,883
Your linguistic love irks me

251
00:17:41,883 --> 00:17:45,495
People of other languages are
making attempts to uproot Tamil

252
00:17:46,518 --> 00:17:49,745
You are not upset with them,
but bothered about my sleep.

253
00:17:49,883 --> 00:17:52,091
Your are too witty

254
00:17:52,302 --> 00:17:53,911
My grand father's influence

255
00:17:54,078 --> 00:17:55,063
Quite obvious

256
00:17:57,187 --> 00:17:58,528
Greetings Poet Vaali.

257
00:17:58,528 --> 00:18:00,717
Vaali?

258
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:02,958
Isn't he Vaali?

259
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:06,038
Can't you spot the difference
between Vaali and Valluvan?

260
00:18:07,602 --> 00:18:11,108
None from this world seem to using brains.

261
00:18:11,226 --> 00:18:13,427
Don't humiliate my family.

262
00:18:13,948 --> 00:18:15,774
What's makes you different from Vaali?

263
00:18:16,275 --> 00:18:18,301
Vaali has penned 10,000 verses.

264
00:18:18,603 --> 00:18:20,953
You have inked just 1500.

265
00:18:21,325 --> 00:18:23,150
But you are shaming my family.

266
00:18:23,229 --> 00:18:25,115
Why did you come to the class, messy hair?

267
00:18:25,262 --> 00:18:27,199
The lord has summoned you.

268
00:18:27,262 --> 00:18:28,474
Why did my father summon?

269
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:30,161
It's your crowning ceremony tomorrow.

270
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:32,017
Tell him that I'll have
the feast the next day.

271
00:18:32,263 --> 00:18:33,263
What?

272
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:34,792
Is he the next lord?

273
00:18:35,238 --> 00:18:37,659
I thought crowning ceremony
was a feast fiesta.

274
00:18:37,982 --> 00:18:38,982
It's natural on earth

275
00:18:39,173 --> 00:18:41,479
for unfits were chosen
to sit on the throne.

276
00:18:41,713 --> 00:18:43,163
Its trending in the world of Yama too.

277
00:18:44,254 --> 00:18:46,441
Seems the eligibility
criteria for a position is

278
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:49,486
to be the least eligible person

279
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:50,708
Please take him.

280
00:18:51,686 --> 00:18:52,686
Master...

281
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,391
Don't presume that I'll
settle down there forever.

282
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:56,567
I'll go meet my dad...

283
00:18:56,979 --> 00:18:59,963
(Sings) 'Party and
position seldom lures me'

284
00:19:02,211 --> 00:19:04,009
I'll make a quick comeback.

285
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:08,760
The one who batted for that ideology is
keen on starting a political outfit.

286
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,730
Had you said it on the earth,
it would have left you clean shaven.

287
00:19:11,913 --> 00:19:12,913
Let's go.

288
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:21,751
Dear boys...

289
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,239
What's wrong with your dance?

290
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,978
There is no grace in your postures.

291
00:19:26,235 --> 00:19:28,338
Follow the steps of your father.

292
00:19:28,497 --> 00:19:29,497
- Is that clear?
- Aye!

293
00:19:35,428 --> 00:19:37,313
Father.. Father!

294
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,801
This is folk dance.

295
00:19:40,209 --> 00:19:41,209
Not Bharatanatyam.

296
00:19:41,487 --> 00:19:42,487
Smart boy.

297
00:19:42,736 --> 00:19:44,368
You are quite vigilant.

298
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:48,391
I'm the father of all form of dances.

299
00:19:48,556 --> 00:19:50,497
So, follow my lead.

300
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:51,657
- Clear?
- Aye, father.

301
00:19:54,084 --> 00:19:55,847
Oh heavenly Father!
lord of the abode!

302
00:19:55,898 --> 00:19:57,620
Androgynous lord!
lord Aadhikeshava!

303
00:19:57,832 --> 00:19:58,832
Lord Eshwara!

304
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,966
Welcome, Chitragupta

305
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:02,170
Give me some time.
I shall pass some instructions to my kids.

306
00:20:02,393 --> 00:20:03,226
- Muruga!
- Dad?

307
00:20:03,305 --> 00:20:04,797
You gallop on the peacock.

308
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:07,022
Vinayaga,
your mom Goddess is going to bathe

309
00:20:07,211 --> 00:20:09,357
- Guard her.
- Aye, father.

310
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,828
Why are you looking tensed, Chitragupta?

311
00:20:11,908 --> 00:20:13,309
You are showing symptoms
of hypertension.

312
00:20:13,464 --> 00:20:16,123
Justice must prevail.
Nepotism must be curbed.

313
00:20:16,434 --> 00:20:20,267
You seem to have forgotten you are
reaping the benefits of nepotism.

314
00:20:20,405 --> 00:20:23,041
Your heirs are performing
rituals in all my temples

315
00:20:23,287 --> 00:20:24,913
That's the cycle of heirs.

316
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:26,593
Can both these positions
weighed on one scale?

317
00:20:26,774 --> 00:20:30,394
I'm talking of good governance.
But you are talking about casteism.

318
00:20:30,618 --> 00:20:31,807
Cool, Chitragupta.

319
00:20:32,045 --> 00:20:34,911
It's wrong to judge some one
before he takes up the job.

320
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,482
When a new Yama is appointed

321
00:20:37,651 --> 00:20:38,651
He is given a free look
period of ' one mandalam"

322
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:40,897
i.,e 48 days.

323
00:20:41,096 --> 00:20:42,847
If he still doesn't meet
the job requirements

324
00:20:43,037 --> 00:20:44,789
He will be dethroned.

325
00:20:45,293 --> 00:20:48,655
- What if he fulfills his duty?
- None can question his authority.

326
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,387
Impossible!!!

327
00:20:50,797 --> 00:20:51,797
Not a chance

328
00:20:52,022 --> 00:20:53,537
I need to pursue my studies, father.

329
00:20:53,825 --> 00:20:54,825
I don't want the throne.

330
00:20:55,157 --> 00:20:56,315
I have my exams tomorrow.

331
00:20:56,677 --> 00:20:59,852
- But it seldom reflects in the results.
- It's your genes.

332
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:01,401
Is it orange?

333
00:21:01,525 --> 00:21:02,661
Since 1000 years...

334
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:06,399
you are spending in a single class

335
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:07,797
Mom!

336
00:21:07,911 --> 00:21:09,187
Kabilar, Avvayaar...

337
00:21:09,491 --> 00:21:11,809
Valluvar, Bharathi, Bharathidasan...

338
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,788
Kannadasan and Karunanidhi too...

339
00:21:13,975 --> 00:21:16,314
I brought them here to teach you.

340
00:21:16,516 --> 00:21:18,157
You scores never improved

341
00:21:18,447 --> 00:21:19,447
Listen to me.

342
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,244
The throne is not an easy offering.

343
00:21:22,577 --> 00:21:26,418
Humans fight in families
for the sake of the power.

344
00:21:26,592 --> 00:21:30,523
And that's the reason that we
shouldn't follow their lead here

345
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,929
and that the reason for my restrain.

346
00:21:32,131 --> 00:21:34,663
- What makes you laugh?
- That's not the scenario here.

347
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:38,990
Because I have only
one wife and one son.

348
00:21:39,217 --> 00:21:41,313
Don't give lame reasons.

349
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:42,458
- Dear son!
- Yes, mom.

350
00:21:42,503 --> 00:21:44,413
You have to accept the offer.

351
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:47,405
People will address me
as 'The mother of King'

352
00:21:47,736 --> 00:21:49,602
Else they will call by name, 'Ayyo'

353
00:21:49,897 --> 00:21:51,219
You have the option to choose.

354
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,719
I'm least about how
they address you.

355
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:53,903
I don't want to take up this.

356
00:21:54,152 --> 00:21:54,916
I want to study.

357
00:21:55,137 --> 00:21:56,558
Don't answer back!

358
00:21:56,891 --> 00:21:58,029
What do you want me to do?

359
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,873
Fine. Just for your sake

360
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,020
I will be the Thu.Dha.pi.

361
00:22:02,229 --> 00:22:04,633
What's Thu.Dha.pi?

362
00:22:04,736 --> 00:22:07,403
I shall act as Thunai Dharma
Prabhu ( Deputy of the lord)

363
00:22:07,555 --> 00:22:08,555
No.

364
00:22:08,556 --> 00:22:11,613
That's not a powerful one.
It's the role of a substitute.

365
00:22:11,804 --> 00:22:14,680
Even the street vendor won't respect us.

366
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,726
The current ministers...

367
00:22:16,926 --> 00:22:20,151
If you don't heed to our obligation...

368
00:22:20,151 --> 00:22:21,851
Your dad and I will end our lives.

369
00:22:22,072 --> 00:22:23,532
Go ahead.

370
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,261
This is the millionth threat.

371
00:22:32,219 --> 00:22:34,571
What do you want me to do?
Crying without shedding tears.

372
00:22:34,761 --> 00:22:37,300
I shall adorn the throne.

373
00:22:37,655 --> 00:22:39,013
- I'm Delighted!
- One liners?

374
00:22:40,046 --> 00:22:41,054
- Son!
- Yes dad.

375
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:43,522
Note down this in your memory.

376
00:22:43,547 --> 00:22:44,056
What's that?

377
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,586
At any cost...

378
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,746
Don't irk lord Shiva.

379
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:49,624
Is he known for his temper?

380
00:22:49,822 --> 00:22:51,621
Why not ask him to take up this duty?

381
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:53,237
Harness this wittiness.

382
00:22:53,526 --> 00:22:54,526
If he gets the info

383
00:22:54,847 --> 00:22:56,633
our family will put to shame.

384
00:22:56,658 --> 00:22:58,157
I have a question.

385
00:22:58,327 --> 00:23:00,154
lord Shiva had shaved his head, didn't He?

386
00:23:00,385 --> 00:23:01,385
Has his hair grown back?

387
00:23:01,478 --> 00:23:03,459
- Speaking of hair...
- Yes...

388
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:06,256
We need to work on
your facial attributes

389
00:23:07,213 --> 00:23:09,552
You look like a child.

390
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:11,979
Change in face?

391
00:23:19,585 --> 00:23:21,153
The son of lord Justice.

392
00:23:21,603 --> 00:23:23,354
The savior of justice.

393
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:26,253
The bachelor degree holder
who will save this world

394
00:23:26,637 --> 00:23:28,673
The savior of the race.

395
00:23:29,078 --> 00:23:30,299
The walking history.

396
00:23:30,585 --> 00:23:32,008
lord of Justice...

397
00:23:32,397 --> 00:23:35,097
Here he treads...

398
00:23:39,554 --> 00:23:41,000
Who are you?

399
00:23:41,203 --> 00:23:42,203
Dad...

400
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:43,512
Why did he slip off?

401
00:23:43,512 --> 00:23:45,026
This is quite usual in politics.

402
00:23:45,198 --> 00:23:46,198
Initially they will on your feet

403
00:23:46,437 --> 00:23:47,506
once reaping the benefits

404
00:23:47,612 --> 00:23:49,756
they will shrug you off.

405
00:23:50,066 --> 00:23:52,840
You can verify the same with
the late leader in heaven.

406
00:23:53,245 --> 00:23:55,289
I have never come cross
this sort of greeting

407
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:56,491
Mother...

408
00:23:56,525 --> 00:23:57,612
He is trying to bite me.

409
00:23:57,835 --> 00:23:58,835
Greetings, lord.

410
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:02,931
- What?
- Why are they stooping so low?

411
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:04,942
Only the leader has changed...

412
00:24:05,107 --> 00:24:07,493
The cabinet remains the same

413
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,324
Father, lord Shiva...

414
00:24:11,953 --> 00:24:12,953
Bless me, lord Shiva.

415
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,250
Son..

416
00:24:16,684 --> 00:24:18,939
- He is the head priest of this world.
- Greetings.

417
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:22,602
I'm least bothered of you.

418
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,888
He looks like a rodent hunter.

419
00:24:24,888 --> 00:24:25,888
He is attempting to harm me.

420
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,354
I did warn you that he is a fool.

421
00:24:28,354 --> 00:24:30,029
Mind your leg.

422
00:24:30,366 --> 00:24:31,494
I asked you to go back.

423
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:33,533
Seek apologies from the head priest.

424
00:24:33,596 --> 00:24:34,905
and seek his blessings.

425
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:37,878
As my mother insists...

426
00:24:38,229 --> 00:24:39,720
I will seek his blessings.

427
00:24:40,165 --> 00:24:41,165
Greetings, dude.

428
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:43,462
Act with wisdom,
victory shall be yours.

429
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:45,997
I shall turn victorious
with honesty.

430
00:24:47,574 --> 00:24:50,809
In the witness of lord Shiva,
the lord of 14 worlds...

431
00:24:51,154 --> 00:24:52,940
I pledge the following

432
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,940
I shall accept the duty of...

433
00:24:53,973 --> 00:24:54,973
I shall accept the duty of...

434
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:56,061
lord of Yamalogam...

435
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:57,099
lord of Yamalogam...

436
00:24:57,255 --> 00:24:58,624
I shall...

437
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,770
I shall...

438
00:24:59,961 --> 00:25:00,742
discharge my duties...

439
00:25:00,865 --> 00:25:01,622
discharge my duties...

440
00:25:01,647 --> 00:25:02,920
with out any prejudice...

441
00:25:03,047 --> 00:25:04,503
with out any prejudice...

442
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,145
Without any...

443
00:25:05,273 --> 00:25:06,082
Without any...

444
00:25:06,106 --> 00:25:07,142
bias...

445
00:25:07,388 --> 00:25:08,610
bias...

446
00:25:09,122 --> 00:25:10,393
Account of human lives...

447
00:25:10,535 --> 00:25:11,707
Account of human lives...

448
00:25:11,732 --> 00:25:12,610
which have expired...

449
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:13,471
which have expired...

450
00:25:13,495 --> 00:25:14,665
shall be...

451
00:25:14,843 --> 00:25:16,489
shall be...

452
00:25:16,867 --> 00:25:18,030
- Worry not... I'm here.
- Haven't you washed it?

453
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:21,369
Those lives...

454
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:24,485
Are you staging a family drama?

455
00:25:24,485 --> 00:25:26,699
I shall use the noose...

456
00:25:26,812 --> 00:25:28,846
I shall use the noose...

457
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,750
- The lord of...
- The lord of...

458
00:25:31,932 --> 00:25:33,291
- 14 worlds...

459
00:25:33,462 --> 00:25:34,789
- 14 worlds...

460
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:39,152
- I shall swear on lord Shiva...
- I shall swear on lord Shiva...

461
00:25:39,191 --> 00:25:41,414
- I take this oath of office...
- I take this oath of office...

462
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:46,374
What's this, father?

463
00:25:57,721 --> 00:25:59,589
Bless me, lord Shiva.

464
00:26:00,396 --> 00:26:01,396
Wish you prosperity.

465
00:26:18,447 --> 00:26:20,447
Height of Himalayas,
sorrow of the enemies,

466
00:26:20,572 --> 00:26:22,447
Timely savior, God of the modern world.

467
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:23,364
- Our philanthropist...
- Hey!

468
00:26:24,989 --> 00:26:26,530
I'm just 5'5" tall.

469
00:26:27,197 --> 00:26:29,697
- Heights of personification!
- Greetings.

470
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:33,030
Stop it!

471
00:26:34,989 --> 00:26:36,530
Stop your groaning.

472
00:26:37,322 --> 00:26:39,030
- Chitragupta!
- Yes, my lord.

473
00:26:39,239 --> 00:26:39,739
Come here.

474
00:26:40,989 --> 00:26:43,280
- What kind of music is this?
- This is divine music, my lord.

475
00:26:43,405 --> 00:26:46,489
- It soothes your mind.
- Not to me.

476
00:26:47,197 --> 00:26:49,197
Is this heaven or hell?

477
00:26:49,614 --> 00:26:51,155
Take them to the court.

478
00:26:51,197 --> 00:26:53,364
How can we send them back
if they are destined to come here?

479
00:26:53,489 --> 00:26:55,280
I know what's in your mind.

480
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,864
You've brought them
here to quench your desires

481
00:26:58,114 --> 00:27:00,405
You've brought Silk Smitha too.

482
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:04,489
I feel remorsed to see the humans' suffer.

483
00:27:04,822 --> 00:27:08,614
And you've brought a foreign
lady model from California.

484
00:27:08,655 --> 00:27:09,447
You monger.

485
00:27:09,572 --> 00:27:12,280
Human's are spending sleepless
nights lost in her thoughts.

486
00:27:12,447 --> 00:27:13,280
My lord.

487
00:27:13,697 --> 00:27:15,239
Even though many are dead,

488
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,239
why are you particularly
worried about Silk Smitha?

489
00:27:20,155 --> 00:27:21,614
I'm her fan.

490
00:27:21,739 --> 00:27:22,905
It's not of your concern.

491
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:26,447
- Do as I say.
- My lord, you are twisting your words.

492
00:27:26,614 --> 00:27:29,155
I will speak as I would like to...

493
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:30,739
Because I'm Yaman.

494
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,114
Ok, my lord.
But we have to play music now.

495
00:27:33,322 --> 00:27:35,322
King or beggar

496
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:38,530
he finally listens
only to our music.

497
00:27:38,572 --> 00:27:40,114
Come on, Velmuruga.

498
00:27:43,905 --> 00:27:46,530
My lord, this is not music.
This is noise.

499
00:27:46,572 --> 00:27:50,197
Not even a human has come to
us without listening to this.

500
00:27:50,197 --> 00:27:52,072
- Ain't I right?
- Yes, my lord.

501
00:27:52,197 --> 00:27:52,989
Velmuruga. Play the beats.

502
00:27:57,864 --> 00:28:00,197
Yes, shuffle the tempo.

503
00:28:01,614 --> 00:28:03,280
Gupta, why is he dancing so wild?

504
00:28:03,572 --> 00:28:05,572
A day is done from 48 days.

505
00:28:07,947 --> 00:28:11,114
- What did he say?
- He told us to keep calm.

506
00:28:11,114 --> 00:28:12,572
- Chitragupta.
- My lord.

507
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,364
Did you listen? This is our music.

508
00:28:15,614 --> 00:28:17,614
- Do you understand?
- Yes, my lord.

509
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:21,322
I'm feeling sleepy.
Let me sleep. Fans on.

510
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,072
They have curtailed my freedom

511
00:28:32,197 --> 00:28:33,947
- in the pretext of responsibilities.
- My lord.

512
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,114
Shall we start the proceedings?

513
00:28:37,489 --> 00:28:40,739
Why're you torturing me, Chitragupta?

514
00:28:41,155 --> 00:28:44,322
I just had good food
and wanted to take a nap.

515
00:28:44,864 --> 00:28:46,864
You always aim to make me work.

516
00:28:47,197 --> 00:28:49,655
- Give me a break.
- You never work.

517
00:28:50,072 --> 00:28:52,072
- Ain't I right, baby?
- You order, my lord.

518
00:28:52,155 --> 00:28:54,030
- Fan on. What is it?
- My lord!

519
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,822
The Yaman of U.S.A is
here to meet you.

520
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,655
I can't meet anyone right now.

521
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:01,697
He's the Yaman of foreign country.
We are obliged.

522
00:29:02,114 --> 00:29:04,114
Please meet him
without any further delay.

523
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,530
- A foreigner? Of which country?
- U.S.A

524
00:29:07,864 --> 00:29:10,989
U.S.A. Chitragupta.
Let him in immediately.

525
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,655
Hi. I'm Donald Trump,
Yaman of U.S.A.

526
00:29:18,864 --> 00:29:22,030
I'm Tamil Yaman
known for hospitality.

527
00:29:22,155 --> 00:29:23,989
- Sit down.
- Ok.

528
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,489
Shabby fellow.

529
00:29:25,947 --> 00:29:27,572
He's too fair complexioned.

530
00:29:29,905 --> 00:29:31,447
- Don't cross your legs.
- Sorry.

531
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,655
Are you the devil in India?

532
00:29:34,155 --> 00:29:35,739
Are you the Yaman of usa?

533
00:29:35,989 --> 00:29:37,989
- Usa?
- What do you mean Usha?

534
00:29:38,072 --> 00:29:40,197
U.S.A sounds 'ush'.

535
00:29:43,905 --> 00:29:45,280
You're a funny guy.

536
00:29:45,447 --> 00:29:48,364
How dare you call me a pig!
I'll break your face with the mace.

537
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:49,655
Chitragupta.

538
00:29:50,364 --> 00:29:52,072
Don't talk unnecessarily, Ok?

539
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,489
- Come to the point.
- Ok, I'll get to the point.

540
00:29:54,947 --> 00:29:56,780
Coming to the topic,

541
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,822
What did he say?

542
00:29:57,822 --> 00:30:00,780
He says that he's
coming to the point.

543
00:30:01,155 --> 00:30:01,989
- What?
- My lord.

544
00:30:07,864 --> 00:30:11,072
Chitragupta. This is a prohibited
language. What is he saying?

545
00:30:11,114 --> 00:30:12,197
Nothing much, My lord.

546
00:30:12,364 --> 00:30:15,364
Two people from his
country came here dead

547
00:30:15,489 --> 00:30:17,405
He's here to take them back.

548
00:30:17,447 --> 00:30:18,614
I disagree.

549
00:30:18,989 --> 00:30:21,405
Those two were the prey of my noose.

550
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:24,572
I'm not giving them.
You may leave.

551
00:30:24,655 --> 00:30:25,989
Daemons, chase him away.

552
00:30:26,114 --> 00:30:27,155
Do you have a demand?

553
00:30:27,489 --> 00:30:28,655
What is it, Chitragupta?

554
00:30:28,697 --> 00:30:33,072
He's ready to agree any of
your demands for them two.

555
00:30:34,072 --> 00:30:36,822
- Anything.
- Anything?

556
00:30:37,905 --> 00:30:39,739
- Yes, buddy.
- Buddy.

557
00:30:44,947 --> 00:30:45,530
Shall we?

558
00:30:47,947 --> 00:30:50,072
One for two? Let me accompany them.

559
00:30:50,822 --> 00:30:52,530
Wait.
Let's see what he's capable of...

560
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:10,447
Long live our king who chased
away the foreigner in his undies.

561
00:31:10,614 --> 00:31:11,947
- Chitragupta.
- My lord.

562
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,030
How do I look in his suit?

563
00:31:16,072 --> 00:31:18,364
Stop riding in your
mouth and speak out.

564
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,572
- How does it look?
- My lord.

565
00:31:20,072 --> 00:31:22,155
He's the Yaman of a developed nation.

566
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:23,655
He shall wear it.

567
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,739
You're the Yaman of
a developing nation.

568
00:31:26,114 --> 00:31:28,780
A waste of 1.5 million rupees.

569
00:31:29,864 --> 00:31:32,322
Does this suit cost
1.5 million rupees?

570
00:31:32,364 --> 00:31:33,197
Yes, my lord.

571
00:31:33,405 --> 00:31:36,239
This means no one in
yamalogam can afford it.

572
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:40,239
Not just yamalogam,
none on earth could afford it too.

573
00:31:40,322 --> 00:31:42,114
Except one.

574
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,614
Did you notice the crowd?

575
00:31:48,739 --> 00:31:51,239
These are the unsolved cases
from his father's time.

576
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,697
It takes days to pass a judgment

577
00:31:53,947 --> 00:31:55,989
I wonder what he's gonna do.

578
00:31:56,905 --> 00:31:57,947
Why bother about him?

579
00:31:57,947 --> 00:31:59,572
- Yes.
- We should safe guard our jobs.

580
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,280
- He's here.
- Move away.

581
00:32:01,489 --> 00:32:03,447
Is this the court
of Yama or a market?

582
00:32:03,447 --> 00:32:04,739
So much crowd. Move away.

583
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,155
First son of King Justice.

584
00:32:06,197 --> 00:32:07,947
- Savior of our society.
- Shut up.

585
00:32:08,447 --> 00:32:10,655
Unable to clear the
crowd, but you praise.

586
00:32:11,197 --> 00:32:11,989
Idiot.

587
00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:15,322
Should I bow down to proceed?

588
00:32:15,489 --> 00:32:16,364
- Sorry, my lord.
- Take it away.

589
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:23,364
You are the one who killed your husband
by smashing his head with a rock?

590
00:32:23,614 --> 00:32:24,530
No, my lord.

591
00:32:24,697 --> 00:32:27,614
- I fell on him.
- It was a metaphor.

592
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,655
It's so funny for you
to kill your husband.

593
00:32:30,905 --> 00:32:32,155
- Ministers.
- Greeting, my lord.

594
00:32:33,655 --> 00:32:35,322
You like criminals.

595
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:37,947
Everyone, take your seats.

596
00:32:41,155 --> 00:32:43,447
Why is it so crowded?
Did my father announce any freebies?

597
00:32:43,905 --> 00:32:47,114
Chitragupta.
Why is our court crowded with humans?

598
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,155
- Tell me.
- My lord...

599
00:32:48,447 --> 00:32:50,322
Including the ones died today

600
00:32:50,322 --> 00:32:53,030
and the pending cases
from your father are here.

601
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,905
- His job is on me now.
- That's the reason for the crowd.

602
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:59,572
There should be no more
pending cases in our court.

603
00:33:00,864 --> 00:33:03,655
Humans! Unlike my father,

604
00:33:03,822 --> 00:33:05,489
I'm a fun lover.

605
00:33:05,655 --> 00:33:08,030
Didn't you notice
when I arrived here?

606
00:33:08,072 --> 00:33:09,822
Yes, we did our lord.

607
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:12,864
My lord,
since the day of your posting

608
00:33:13,155 --> 00:33:14,989
you never did anything funny.

609
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,239
You guys weren't funny either.

610
00:33:17,322 --> 00:33:19,947
You've been here since ages.
Shut up.

611
00:33:20,155 --> 00:33:21,197
Shooting out dumb questions.

612
00:33:22,364 --> 00:33:25,197
I've a good news for you, humans.

613
00:33:25,322 --> 00:33:27,989
I'm gonna send sinners to heaven.

614
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,530
What about the righteous souls?

615
00:33:34,614 --> 00:33:37,655
I'll direct them to hell.

616
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,239
What rustling is this?

617
00:33:42,572 --> 00:33:43,655
Stupid judgment.

618
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:44,780
Do you understand?

619
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,447
Yes, we do understand.

620
00:33:46,447 --> 00:33:52,364
Speak out from the heart.
People who accept their sins come to this side.

621
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,489
Come.

622
00:33:56,489 --> 00:33:58,489
- Don't rush.
- Don't push.

623
00:33:58,655 --> 00:33:59,405
Come on.

624
00:34:01,614 --> 00:34:06,155
You're the ones who harmed
others on earth. Isn't it?

625
00:34:06,239 --> 00:34:07,405
Yes.

626
00:34:09,155 --> 00:34:12,072
Tell me about your sins.

627
00:34:12,322 --> 00:34:16,989
I poisoned my mother-in-law
by trapping her with sweet words.

628
00:34:18,197 --> 00:34:21,114
She suffered to death.
Will I go to heaven?

629
00:34:22,072 --> 00:34:24,030
Yes.
You will be escorted to heaven.

630
00:34:24,114 --> 00:34:24,989
Next.

631
00:34:25,114 --> 00:34:25,572
My lord.

632
00:34:25,572 --> 00:34:28,197
- What is it?
- I gave loan to people

633
00:34:28,364 --> 00:34:31,072
with high interest rate.
Many families committed suicide.

634
00:34:31,114 --> 00:34:32,322
Will I go to heaven?

635
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,822
You deserve it.

636
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:38,614
I've eaten people's money.
Never let people live.

637
00:34:38,822 --> 00:34:41,197
- Send me to heaven, my lord.
- Sure. Next.

638
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:44,114
I had an affair with his wife.

639
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,155
- Is it so?
- He doesn’t know yet.

640
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:50,030
- Will I go to heaven?
- Yes.

641
00:34:50,197 --> 00:34:53,322
I've earned people assets by
threatening and beating them up.

642
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:55,322
I've even murdered three people.

643
00:34:55,322 --> 00:34:57,155
Are you sure you want heaven?

644
00:34:57,155 --> 00:34:58,072
Yes, sure.

645
00:34:58,197 --> 00:34:59,905
None of you want any punishment?

646
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,239
No, we don't.

647
00:35:01,405 --> 00:35:04,947
You commit sins and
refuse punishment.

648
00:35:05,364 --> 00:35:07,530
Who else would punish you?

649
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,197
What does he mean?

650
00:35:10,197 --> 00:35:11,780
- Chitragupta.
- My lord.

651
00:35:11,989 --> 00:35:13,780
Take them to the hell.

652
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:16,780
- Fry them in a grill.
- Daemons.

653
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,239
Take them away.

654
00:35:19,364 --> 00:35:21,655
Move fast. Move.

655
00:35:25,447 --> 00:35:27,447
Desire is the luring trap for humans.

656
00:35:30,405 --> 00:35:31,572
- Chitragupta.
- My lord.

657
00:35:31,989 --> 00:35:33,989
Who are these six? Check them.

658
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,114
What sins did you all commit?

659
00:35:37,447 --> 00:35:39,447
Hell or heaven?

660
00:35:39,905 --> 00:35:40,489
Tell me.

661
00:35:42,989 --> 00:35:44,447
Tell me, man.

662
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,489
My lord, he's deaf.

663
00:35:47,572 --> 00:35:49,905
So he was deaf to my jokes?

664
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,114
No, my lord.

665
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,905
You shut up.

666
00:35:53,155 --> 00:35:55,739
Sir, we followed the path
of righteousness on earth

667
00:35:55,947 --> 00:35:58,155
But we still suffer.

668
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:01,655
Hell doesn't bother us.
we shall go to hell.

669
00:36:02,072 --> 00:36:03,864
You didn't commit any sin.

670
00:36:04,197 --> 00:36:07,197
Creator Lord Brahma
was unfair to you.

671
00:36:07,322 --> 00:36:08,322
- Chitragupta.
- My lord.

672
00:36:09,197 --> 00:36:11,364
Send them to heaven.

673
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:16,322
Stop strolling.
Pace up.

674
00:36:17,072 --> 00:36:17,989
Take them there.

675
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:22,447
Faster. Aren’t you getting paid?

676
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:24,614
- Sullen faced, Chitragupta.
- My lord.

677
00:36:24,614 --> 00:36:26,530
How is my way of ruling?

678
00:36:26,905 --> 00:36:30,780
- Excellent.
- Stop riding and start working.

679
00:36:31,739 --> 00:36:33,739
Where was the one who
was asking for fun?

680
00:36:33,947 --> 00:36:35,239
Hey, you idiot.

681
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:37,114
- Come here.
- My lord.

682
00:36:37,655 --> 00:36:38,655
Yes, my lord.

683
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,197
Go back.

684
00:36:40,322 --> 00:36:42,905
- He's crazy.
- Isn't it funny, Chitragupta?

685
00:36:43,655 --> 00:36:47,114
I thought he's illiterate fool.
He proved me wrong.

686
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,364
This shouldn't continue.

687
00:36:59,405 --> 00:37:01,905
Where did Mr.Gupta go?

688
00:37:10,905 --> 00:37:11,864
Mr. Chitragupta.

689
00:37:13,405 --> 00:37:17,239
You're sad and drinking alone.

690
00:37:18,655 --> 00:37:19,364
What to do?

691
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:22,197
No use of trusting you guys.

692
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,739
Hence I'm struggling alone.

693
00:37:27,322 --> 00:37:30,947
May I suggest you a plan?

694
00:37:34,489 --> 00:37:34,989
Tell me.

695
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,905
There is a person here from earth.

696
00:37:37,072 --> 00:37:38,405
He's very smart.

697
00:37:39,197 --> 00:37:42,530
Prime Ministers to Chief
Ministers seek his advise.

698
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,780
He's known for his statesmanship.

699
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,864
His name is Ko. Rangasamy.

700
00:37:48,364 --> 00:37:50,947
People call him Rangu.

701
00:37:51,114 --> 00:37:52,739
How do you know him?

702
00:37:53,614 --> 00:37:55,239
Why're you doing this?

703
00:37:55,447 --> 00:37:59,114
I listened to his advice
for claiming your position.

704
00:37:59,114 --> 00:38:00,155
For my position?

705
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:05,447
No Mr. Gupta.
Somehow you will claim the throne

706
00:38:05,614 --> 00:38:08,072
Your post would be vacant then.

707
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:11,864
Ain't it right for me
to wish for your post?

708
00:38:12,322 --> 00:38:14,780
I'm not sure if I'm
laying a trap for him...

709
00:38:15,197 --> 00:38:17,405
But you are doing a good job.

710
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:22,114
Ko. Rangasamy.

711
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:24,864
He's my descendent too.

712
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:30,114
But earthians are known for
their dishonesty. That's stopping me.

713
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:34,072
We can trust anyone
in the current situation.

714
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,655
We should accomplish our mission.

715
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,405
I've been noticing you
since you came here

716
00:38:46,739 --> 00:38:49,864
Why do you keep one
of your arm hidden? Any problem?

717
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,864
- No Mr. Gupta... that's...
- Then bring it front.

718
00:38:55,072 --> 00:38:56,947
- No. It's...
- Bring it.

719
00:39:00,614 --> 00:39:04,114
You came for the drink and
pretend to give me idea.

720
00:39:04,822 --> 00:39:07,197
It's true that I came for the drink.

721
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,489
It's my long term wish

722
00:39:11,739 --> 00:39:14,072
that you should become Dharmaprabu.

723
00:39:16,364 --> 00:39:18,197
This is an honest intention.

724
00:39:21,947 --> 00:39:25,072
Ok. Let's try out your idea.

725
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:26,489
Come.

726
00:39:29,655 --> 00:39:30,697
One more...

727
00:39:42,197 --> 00:39:43,197
Greetings.

728
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,822
Minister...
Is he Ko. Rangasamy?

729
00:39:54,155 --> 00:39:55,072
Yes, Mr. Gupta.

730
00:39:55,364 --> 00:39:56,405
Chitragupta.

731
00:39:56,989 --> 00:40:00,072
Sending me to hell with my deeds

732
00:40:00,489 --> 00:40:02,655
now it looks like you're
waiting to meet me.

733
00:40:02,655 --> 00:40:06,072
How dare you insult me?

734
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:07,030
Minister...

735
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:10,114
- Should we listen to his advise?
- We have no choice.

736
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:12,280
- We should listen to him.
- Why not?

737
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,655
He may be powerful on earth.

738
00:40:14,822 --> 00:40:18,197
Here I'm good as I can kill a
thousand with my single sign.

739
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:20,822
- Don't forget.
- We don't have time for it.

740
00:40:22,155 --> 00:40:26,989
We are the one's who decide
fate of people to see God.

741
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:31,155
Hence people fear us next to God.

742
00:40:31,614 --> 00:40:32,905
Muscle power is of no use

743
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,239
Being smart is important.

744
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:38,780
Despite of being afraid
on Karate black belt,

745
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,530
people are scared of this....

746
00:40:41,655 --> 00:40:43,030
Ok. Come to the point.

747
00:40:43,447 --> 00:40:45,322
Whose life should be
spoiled for whose benefit?

748
00:40:45,822 --> 00:40:48,489
Accompany me and destroy Yaman.

749
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:52,405
Chasing away Dharmaprabu
from his post

750
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:54,572
I should get the throne.

751
00:40:54,697 --> 00:40:56,697
Tell me if you have
any plans for that.

752
00:40:57,072 --> 00:41:00,280
Fight for throne in Yamalogam too?

753
00:41:00,739 --> 00:41:03,780
There is no soul who hates
thrones in the universe.

754
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:07,447
List our family members...
Especially female siblings

755
00:41:13,489 --> 00:41:15,155
I've got one sister. Why?

756
00:41:15,489 --> 00:41:16,322
Is she married?

757
00:41:21,114 --> 00:41:23,989
- No. Why?
- It's fine, even if she's married.

758
00:41:26,364 --> 00:41:28,364
Even that's fine?

759
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:30,322
What are you gonna do with her?

760
00:41:30,864 --> 00:41:32,947
What could I do?

761
00:41:33,197 --> 00:41:35,489
Ask her what can she
do for Dharmaprabu.

762
00:41:36,989 --> 00:41:39,405
He should be ready to
pay her back anything.

763
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,447
That's important.

764
00:41:41,114 --> 00:41:41,822
Minister.

765
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:48,072
Yes.

766
00:41:53,655 --> 00:41:57,280
They told you're great statesman,
but you ask me to be a pimp.

767
00:41:57,405 --> 00:42:00,239
I didn't. You thought cheap.

768
00:42:00,655 --> 00:42:03,364
Since I'm smart

769
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:08,530
Prime Ministers and Chief
Ministers were queuing up to meet me.

770
00:42:09,114 --> 00:42:10,447
Try to understand.

771
00:42:10,905 --> 00:42:14,822
Smartness achieves things that
can't be done by blood and blades.

772
00:42:15,114 --> 00:42:17,447
You tell me. In this world,

773
00:42:17,905 --> 00:42:20,072
is there any man who doesn't
fall for woman's beauty?

774
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,989
Check any ministers in the world.

775
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:24,697
their brother-in-laws are
placed better than them.

776
00:42:24,864 --> 00:42:27,364
You won't understand.
Give it a thought.

777
00:42:27,655 --> 00:42:30,739
Do you want the post or your pride?

778
00:42:33,697 --> 00:42:34,322
The post.

779
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:38,947
You scared me for a second.

780
00:42:39,739 --> 00:42:41,905
I've given an idea
for you to claim the post.

781
00:42:42,572 --> 00:42:44,739
What's my reward?

782
00:42:44,905 --> 00:42:46,655
What wish could you have after death?

783
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,905
You shouldn't ask this to a corpse?

784
00:42:49,322 --> 00:42:51,322
Human desires doesn't end.

785
00:42:51,905 --> 00:42:55,030
Assure me a place in heaven for me.

786
00:42:56,822 --> 00:42:58,989
- Minister, what is this?
- Let's send him there.

787
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,030
Bring the angels.

788
00:43:02,489 --> 00:43:04,405
Hurry up, angels.

789
00:43:07,405 --> 00:43:08,905
Chitragupta, all the best.

790
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:12,989
Let him be on waiting list.

791
00:43:13,364 --> 00:43:14,697
Let's confirm later.

792
00:43:15,155 --> 00:43:17,322
- Minister?
- Yes, sir.

793
00:43:17,447 --> 00:43:19,364
- Will this work out?
- Yes.

794
00:43:19,822 --> 00:43:22,572
Go and make your sister ready.

795
00:43:22,572 --> 00:43:26,405
- My sister?
- Dharmaprabu of the future!

796
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,780
Long live the Dharmaprabu
of the future.

797
00:43:32,405 --> 00:43:34,780
Remember my words, sister.

798
00:44:06,364 --> 00:44:07,030
What are you doing?

799
00:44:07,405 --> 00:44:09,655
Look. I'm not that kind of a person.
Don't.

800
00:44:16,655 --> 00:44:18,947
You get out.

801
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:19,822
Dork!

802
00:44:19,864 --> 00:44:21,197
Dork? Get out.

803
00:44:27,947 --> 00:44:28,655
You go, dear.

804
00:44:31,989 --> 00:44:33,322
Chitragupta.

805
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,030
Summon here, bean pole.

806
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:37,322
Come here.

807
00:44:37,822 --> 00:44:40,155
- My lord.
- Your honesty saved your sister.

808
00:44:40,614 --> 00:44:42,614
- I don't understand, my lord.
- What don't you understand?

809
00:44:42,739 --> 00:44:45,197
Humans desire for
land, gold and women.

810
00:44:45,489 --> 00:44:46,822
I'm Yaman.

811
00:44:47,197 --> 00:44:49,614
- Tell her this, you idiot.
- Ok, my lord.

812
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,947
Oh my God. My family and
sister's reputation is spoiled.

813
00:44:55,322 --> 00:44:57,030
I can't face her anymore.

814
00:44:57,447 --> 00:44:58,364
Chitragupta.

815
00:44:58,989 --> 00:45:02,322
Are you anxious about the
arrangements for your oath ceremony?

816
00:45:03,447 --> 00:45:05,947
I would have been fired
because of your advise.

817
00:45:06,489 --> 00:45:07,530
What happened?

818
00:45:07,572 --> 00:45:10,197
He spit on my face.
Didn't you have better ideas?

819
00:45:11,364 --> 00:45:12,905
Didn't you have any other sisters?

820
00:45:13,989 --> 00:45:16,322
What did he say?

821
00:45:16,489 --> 00:45:19,614
Your sister is not fit for the job.

822
00:45:19,739 --> 00:45:21,405
Do you have

823
00:45:21,697 --> 00:45:28,530
any women relatives
who are beautiful?

824
00:45:29,489 --> 00:45:32,197
He says that such girls will fit the job.

825
00:45:33,322 --> 00:45:34,989
- You're the one who brought him here.
- Yes.

826
00:45:34,989 --> 00:45:37,155
Run away.

827
00:45:38,072 --> 00:45:41,197
Gupta. You don't understand him.

828
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,280
Let me explain.

829
00:45:43,364 --> 00:45:47,030
He's fine with your distant
relatives too. Am I right?

830
00:45:47,072 --> 00:45:48,780
- Yes.
- Yes, he's right.

831
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:50,989
- Get out.
- Oh God.

832
00:45:53,114 --> 00:45:56,905
- Gupta. Very distant relatives...
- Go to hell.

833
00:45:57,114 --> 00:45:58,322
It's not your fault.

834
00:45:58,739 --> 00:45:59,572
It's my fate.

835
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:06,447
It's my fate not to rule
but to assist till my death.

836
00:46:07,072 --> 00:46:08,072
It's my fate.

837
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:10,239
- My fate.
- Chitragupta. Relax.

838
00:46:12,405 --> 00:46:13,739
Don't depend on fate
when you are frustrated.

839
00:46:14,405 --> 00:46:18,447
This lie called fate was created by
us to avoid others from prospering.

840
00:46:19,489 --> 00:46:21,489
We shouldn't fall for it.

841
00:46:21,947 --> 00:46:25,030
This is not just your defeat.
Mine too.

842
00:46:25,864 --> 00:46:28,739
The failure of smartest
statesman of earth.

843
00:46:28,989 --> 00:46:33,822
I've confused you just
like I do to laymen.

844
00:46:35,114 --> 00:46:36,780
You're Chitragupta.
You're a winner.

845
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:41,072
I'll definitely will give you a
new idea that makes sure you win.

846
00:46:45,739 --> 00:46:46,405
Go away.

847
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:05,150
Chitragupta!

848
00:47:05,362 --> 00:47:06,362
Don't worry

849
00:47:06,634 --> 00:47:08,947
- I've a brilliant plan for you
- Not needed!

850
00:47:09,387 --> 00:47:10,387
This is my designation

851
00:47:10,716 --> 00:47:11,851
I can think on my own.

852
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,646
Please don't interfere.

853
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:16,261
Chitragupta, you've to put
efforts if you need a position

854
00:47:16,742 --> 00:47:18,397
An elephant's strength
is in its trunk.

855
00:47:18,768 --> 00:47:20,501
A crocodile's
strength is in water.

856
00:47:20,743 --> 00:47:22,848
Likewise Yaman's
strength is Yamalogam

857
00:47:23,222 --> 00:47:26,573
So, you expel Yaman
from his Yamalogam

858
00:47:28,857 --> 00:47:31,004
- Where to expel?
- To Earth.

859
00:47:31,573 --> 00:47:33,587
To Earth? Why?

860
00:47:33,753 --> 00:47:35,529
Earth will induce
desires in him.

861
00:47:35,779 --> 00:47:36,779
His mind will baffle.

862
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,100
A baffled mind will
commit mistakes.

863
00:47:39,625 --> 00:47:41,067
He can be cornered
for his mistakes.

864
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:44,010
That is fine.

865
00:47:44,659 --> 00:47:47,146
How can we reason him
to take him to Earth?

866
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:50,178
You've asked the intelligent
question of your life.

867
00:47:50,428 --> 00:47:55,904
You rewrite the 'Book of life and death' in
such a way that no deaths occur.

868
00:47:56,192 --> 00:47:58,043
Then Yamalogam becomes idle.

869
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:00,983
If Yaman asks you the reason,

870
00:48:01,054 --> 00:48:03,487
reply that he can find
the answer only on the Earth.

871
00:48:03,572 --> 00:48:07,272
If he doesn't accept, scare him that
he will be answerable to Lord Shiva.

872
00:48:07,292 --> 00:48:11,081
Threaten him that Lord Siva would sentence
him to death, if he fails to answer...

873
00:48:11,203 --> 00:48:12,927
Then Yaman's position
will become vacant.

874
00:48:12,995 --> 00:48:14,582
You can get his spot for sure.

875
00:48:14,634 --> 00:48:17,565
- But, how can I do a scam by rewriting?
- Haven't you done a scam?

876
00:48:17,565 --> 00:48:19,099
I've done petty stuffs.

877
00:48:19,184 --> 00:48:21,536
Visit Earth,
you will become a master of scam.

878
00:48:30,504 --> 00:48:34,549
What! It looks like a maths classroom.
Everyone has absconded.

879
00:48:35,034 --> 00:48:37,268
Just these two morons are here.

880
00:48:37,472 --> 00:48:38,809
Watch out for performance...

881
00:48:38,877 --> 00:48:40,027
Hmmm...

882
00:48:40,027 --> 00:48:42,042
Be alert.
Yaman has arrived.

883
00:48:42,349 --> 00:48:45,041
Where did everyone go?

884
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,845
Hey! Useless Ministers!

885
00:48:49,208 --> 00:48:51,923
Where are the Ministers
and the demons of our fort.

886
00:48:52,072 --> 00:48:53,532
Chitraguptan is also missing!

887
00:48:53,855 --> 00:48:55,685
Actually...
What should I tell?

888
00:48:55,883 --> 00:48:57,018
Hey! Answer me!

889
00:48:57,188 --> 00:49:01,027
Lord! We too are looking out for
him, since morning.

890
00:49:01,031 --> 00:49:02,882
We couldn't find him anywhere.

891
00:49:02,882 --> 00:49:03,882
Couldn't find?

892
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:06,483
Idiots! Go! Find him.

893
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,881
We searched the entire Yamalogam already.

894
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:10,486
Don't talk a word.
Just search for him.

895
00:49:10,553 --> 00:49:12,158
- Get lost!
- Yes! My lord!

896
00:49:13,122 --> 00:49:14,834
- Where the hell are you going?
Hey!

897
00:49:14,834 --> 00:49:17,068
Don't over perform! Get out!

898
00:49:17,068 --> 00:49:18,673
He won't go anywhere
without informing me.

899
00:49:18,698 --> 00:49:21,207
- Have you met Chitraguptan?
- No, my Lord!

900
00:49:21,282 --> 00:49:23,136
How come he left without
informing even you?

901
00:49:23,153 --> 00:49:25,093
Where would he have gone?

902
00:49:26,939 --> 00:49:29,290
Dear! Should I tell you personally?

903
00:49:29,318 --> 00:49:30,991
Won't you search? Go!
Search!

904
00:49:30,991 --> 00:49:33,846
I want to tell you
something personally.

905
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,521
- To me?
- Yes.

906
00:49:35,628 --> 00:49:38,643
- What is the matter?
- Actually...

907
00:49:38,765 --> 00:49:40,460
It is highly confidential

908
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:43,863
Hmm. Maids,
you can leave this place.

909
00:49:43,934 --> 00:49:44,934
Get lost!

910
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:48,468
You should keep it a secret.

911
00:49:48,877 --> 00:49:51,232
You mustn't spill the beans.

912
00:49:51,232 --> 00:49:53,223
The maids have gone.
Spit it out!

913
00:49:53,349 --> 00:49:59,543
No dead people from earth have come
to Yamalogam, for the past two days.

914
00:49:59,575 --> 00:50:02,226
- Hmm...
- It has been a layoff for two days.

915
00:50:02,303 --> 00:50:04,842
-If Lord Shiva, comes to know about it...
-Hmm...

916
00:50:04,842 --> 00:50:06,840
If he shows up His anger

917
00:50:06,844 --> 00:50:09,699
Then, it will be a threat for
your position or even your life

918
00:50:09,782 --> 00:50:11,883
My father used to tell that
He is nagging guy!

919
00:50:12,657 --> 00:50:13,657
Tell me a way out!

920
00:50:13,762 --> 00:50:18,937
There could be an Anti-Yama revolution
or rebellion against you on earth.

921
00:50:18,937 --> 00:50:21,441
That could be the reason why
none has died to come up here.

922
00:50:21,463 --> 00:50:25,068
Chitraguptan speculated this and
to verify, he has gone to the earth.

923
00:50:25,418 --> 00:50:30,130
My foot! Who can revolt
against me on earth?

924
00:50:30,144 --> 00:50:34,425
For investigating that matter,
he left all alone risking his life.

925
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:38,046
Hey! Even here he used to roam
like his life was threatened.

926
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:39,709
But, I can't trust him.

927
00:50:39,709 --> 00:50:41,957
He loves you in
leaps and bounds!

928
00:50:42,012 --> 00:50:44,430
I can believe everything
you've told so far.

929
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:45,947
But, I'll never
believe the last one.

930
00:50:45,997 --> 00:50:47,288
- Minister!
- Hmm.

931
00:50:47,348 --> 00:50:48,708
I know him.

932
00:50:49,072 --> 00:50:51,544
I swear my Lord! You can call the maids.

933
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:53,015
I can touch them
and swear on them.

934
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,225
What? You gonna touch
maids for a promise!

935
00:50:55,332 --> 00:50:57,540
Are they a holy book
to touch and swear on?

936
00:50:57,592 --> 00:51:01,806
-You touch elsewhere to swear on.
- Okay, I swear on your vehicle!

937
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:04,476
My vehicle itself has
accepted it as fact!

938
00:51:04,851 --> 00:51:05,851
Huh!

939
00:51:05,863 --> 00:51:06,863
Chitragupta!

940
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:11,031
For my sake you've risked
your life and gone to earth!

941
00:51:11,739 --> 00:51:13,674
I will come and rescue you.

942
00:51:13,956 --> 00:51:15,466
Here I come!

943
00:51:15,501 --> 00:51:17,179
My Lord! Please don't do this!

944
00:51:17,191 --> 00:51:19,480
He will complete the job and return.
You be patient.

945
00:51:19,489 --> 00:51:22,840
Are you asking me to be a
couch potato, till he returns?

946
00:51:22,867 --> 00:51:24,124
- I'm leaving.
- Lord! Please!

947
00:51:24,136 --> 00:51:25,528
- Wait, he'll be back.
- He is not letting me go.

948
00:51:25,528 --> 00:51:27,198
- Maids!
- Yes, Lord!

949
00:51:27,258 --> 00:51:29,513
Play with him, till I return!

950
00:51:29,556 --> 00:51:30,600
You can leave now. Go! Go!

951
00:51:30,651 --> 00:51:33,387
For identifying this, I lied.
Gotcha scoundrel!

952
00:51:33,487 --> 00:51:35,781
Till I return you stay at Devalogam!

953
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,664
You prove that you're
a Koovathur Minister.

954
00:51:37,664 --> 00:51:39,355
I would slap you.

955
00:51:39,385 --> 00:51:40,011
Move aside.

956
00:51:40,071 --> 00:51:43,172
Chitragupta!
Your Yamadharman is coming for you!

957
00:51:43,289 --> 00:51:48,151
Please do leave, my Lord!
Please don't leave!

958
00:52:30,634 --> 00:52:33,490
Hey! You Drunkard!

959
00:52:33,764 --> 00:52:35,919
Dance a bit closer.

960
00:52:35,941 --> 00:52:38,801
- Who's that?
- Yaman!

961
00:52:39,361 --> 00:52:41,467
My Lord! How come you're here?

962
00:52:41,642 --> 00:52:42,758
How did they permit you in?

963
00:52:42,802 --> 00:52:45,162
Hey! I opened the door and walked in.

964
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:47,264
They told I needed something
called shoe to get in.

965
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:48,887
I showed them the Shoe
they allowed me in.

966
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:51,075
Have the moron
ministers informed you?

967
00:52:51,075 --> 00:52:53,397
I haven't asked.
They voluntarily spilled the beans.

968
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:54,436
That's okay.

969
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:57,798
They informed that you've risked
your life by visiting earth.

970
00:52:57,863 --> 00:53:00,200
But here, you are
with girls in mini-skirts!

971
00:53:00,223 --> 00:53:03,156
And celebrating a
booze-up party with them!

972
00:53:03,196 --> 00:53:04,654
What! Is it a Goa trip?

973
00:53:04,654 --> 00:53:07,185
Oh Lord!
This is called modern culture!

974
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:10,077
Girls can go anywhere, as they like.

975
00:53:10,177 --> 00:53:14,533
This is how they prove
that they are no lesser than men.

976
00:53:14,561 --> 00:53:17,851
That's why they released
150 video scandals!

977
00:53:17,869 --> 00:53:21,198
Look at her! Nothing's there.
Just dancing!

978
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:22,868
Did you come to see this? Hmm!

979
00:53:22,868 --> 00:53:25,188
- I'm swearing on you...
- Just a minute.

980
00:53:25,407 --> 00:53:27,451
- Hey you, dumb dace...

981
00:53:27,581 --> 00:53:30,529
- How long he has been here?
- Since the pub is open, he's with us.

982
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:34,939
Scoundrel! How dare you fake
a promise on me? Come out!

983
00:53:35,063 --> 00:53:36,596
- Come out!
- My Lord!

984
00:53:37,805 --> 00:53:40,740
Chitragupta! Have you noticed
the equality you told about?

985
00:53:40,824 --> 00:53:42,680
- Turn around...
- Hmm.

986
00:53:43,077 --> 00:53:44,160
- Hey Lady!
- What?

987
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,688
Won't your husband question
about your night boozes?

988
00:53:47,985 --> 00:53:49,345
- He won't mind.
- Why?

989
00:53:49,885 --> 00:53:51,787
He is the one
pouring my glasses!

990
00:53:51,787 --> 00:53:53,589
- Darling, one more large?
- Large! My foot!

991
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:55,341
Look. Is he listening to me?

992
00:53:55,719 --> 00:53:58,827
Take a look, Chitragupta.
The earth is tilted.

993
00:53:59,063 --> 00:54:01,173
- Hmmm.
- Now it is not tilted.

994
00:54:02,577 --> 00:54:04,553
- Hmm..
- Hi.

995
00:54:04,922 --> 00:54:07,660
My Lord! No wonder,
you aptly reached the earth.

996
00:54:07,704 --> 00:54:10,074
But, how did you find me?

997
00:54:10,253 --> 00:54:14,113
Huh! Are you a drowned aircraft,
to make finding you so difficult?

998
00:54:14,188 --> 00:54:18,231
Hey! You won't deal with work
past 6 O'clock in Yamalogam

999
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:20,241
Instead,
you deal with maids and get beaten

1000
00:54:20,273 --> 00:54:21,683
- Don't I know?
- No my Lord...

1001
00:54:21,683 --> 00:54:23,924
Here, pubs are more in
number than schools.

1002
00:54:23,949 --> 00:54:25,577
Well said, Chitragupta.

1003
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:29,424
I've been searching for you
since morning and exhausted.

1004
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:32,978
We must investigate
why no deaths occur. Come!

1005
00:54:33,629 --> 00:54:36,235
Chitragupta,
have a look at my vehicle.

1006
00:54:37,672 --> 00:54:38,672
- My Lord!
- Hmm.

1007
00:54:39,089 --> 00:54:40,089
What vehicle is this?

1008
00:54:40,584 --> 00:54:43,678
This vehicle is our family's asset.
Come, I'll explain you.

1009
00:54:43,914 --> 00:54:44,914
Sit!

1010
00:54:45,739 --> 00:54:46,764
- Shall we go?
- Yes

1011
00:54:46,764 --> 00:54:48,370
- Go. Go.
- Hmm.

1012
00:54:55,636 --> 00:54:59,236
- Chitragupta! How is our Vehicle?
- Good, but...

1013
00:54:59,263 --> 00:55:01,373
Does it have fuel?

1014
00:55:01,425 --> 00:55:03,921
For my quarterly examinations,
Satyananda did...

1015
00:55:04,043 --> 00:55:05,788
- Hmm
- What a bad-mouth you are!

1016
00:55:05,824 --> 00:55:06,824
Push the Vehicle.

1017
00:55:06,968 --> 00:55:10,952
♫ Our bodies are temporary,
just like air filled bags, ♫

1018
00:55:10,971 --> 00:55:15,593
♫ Yet we ogle at women with lust. ♫

1019
00:55:15,847 --> 00:55:17,463
Stop your folk song!

1020
00:55:21,772 --> 00:55:23,883
Chitragupta!
Who is this man?

1021
00:55:24,117 --> 00:55:26,219
He is heftier than me.

1022
00:55:26,219 --> 00:55:27,432
- Him?
- Hmm.

1023
00:55:27,531 --> 00:55:29,117
He is E.V.Ramasamy.

1024
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:32,387
Humans call him by the name Periyar.

1025
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:34,108
- Periyar?
- Hmm

1026
00:55:34,156 --> 00:55:37,113
What did he do so wise to
be called as Periyar (Wise man)

1027
00:55:37,196 --> 00:55:42,571
He voiced against alcoholism,
women slavery and superstitions.

1028
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:46,049
Being a God, you got drunk.
How can humans refrain?

1029
00:55:46,281 --> 00:55:48,031
Let's have a closer look.

1030
00:55:48,253 --> 00:55:49,408
What's written on it?

1031
00:55:49,468 --> 00:55:52,520
Forget God.
Think of Human.

1032
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:54,987
- Which means...
- Damn you.

1033
00:55:55,014 --> 00:55:59,208
Gods like us should be forgotten.

1034
00:55:59,268 --> 00:56:01,378
Humans should be
respected humanely.

1035
00:56:01,795 --> 00:56:03,328
He advised righteously.

1036
00:56:03,822 --> 00:56:04,822
Chitragupta!

1037
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:06,573
- Let us meet him
- Hmm.

1038
00:56:06,615 --> 00:56:08,546
- And discuss with him.
- Not possible, my Lord!

1039
00:56:08,614 --> 00:56:10,145
- Why?
- Your father took his life long ago.

1040
00:56:10,157 --> 00:56:12,319
That's right, when did my
father let good people live!

1041
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:15,596
-That's why humans have erected a statue his memory
- Oh!

1042
00:56:15,631 --> 00:56:19,392
Still, many are waiting
to break the statue.

1043
00:56:19,479 --> 00:56:22,360
- Are they expecting or you?
- No, My Lord.

1044
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,360
Stop!

1045
00:56:23,966 --> 00:56:25,581
Love is God!

1046
00:56:25,894 --> 00:56:27,405
Why did you say this?

1047
00:56:27,441 --> 00:56:29,052
This words needs to oblige
by just this one liner.

1048
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:31,349
- I'll inform Lord Shiva about you.
- Lord! No, please.

1049
00:56:31,381 --> 00:56:32,381
Come. Push.

1050
00:56:32,743 --> 00:56:34,251
Continue that song.

1051
00:56:39,618 --> 00:56:40,618
Chitragupta!

1052
00:56:41,035 --> 00:56:43,634
Who is that man with book in his hands?
A school teacher?

1053
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:45,830
- Yes, My lord. He's a teacher.
- Oh.

1054
00:56:45,993 --> 00:56:47,608
- His name is Ambedkar.
- Is it?

1055
00:56:47,675 --> 00:56:49,630
He studied law,
when casteism had barred clothing.

1056
00:56:49,655 --> 00:56:50,048
Hmm.

1057
00:56:50,123 --> 00:56:51,857
He framed the constitution
of this country.

1058
00:56:51,882 --> 00:56:52,295
Awesome.

1059
00:56:52,295 --> 00:56:53,553
All humans are equal.

1060
00:56:53,553 --> 00:56:57,076
He advised to give up castes
and live united.

1061
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:59,124
But,
nobody listened to his words.

1062
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,224
If they had listen, why would they
fight for religion and castes?

1063
00:57:01,249 --> 00:57:03,824
- That's why they labelled
him as a caste leader. - Hmm.

1064
00:57:04,032 --> 00:57:07,397
And made him stand as a statue.
This is people's achievement!

1065
00:57:07,444 --> 00:57:08,212
God forsaken people!

1066
00:57:08,237 --> 00:57:10,873
How pity they turned a Law
genius into a caste leader!

1067
00:57:10,873 --> 00:57:13,485
These humans are incorrigible.

1068
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,466
- Chitragupta!
- My Lord!

1069
00:57:18,466 --> 00:57:19,478
Who is this gentleman?

1070
00:57:19,554 --> 00:57:21,886
He looks so majestic like me.

1071
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:23,613
- Not even the looks...
- Hmm...

1072
00:57:23,613 --> 00:57:25,983
- His life is heroic.
- Is it?

1073
00:57:26,019 --> 00:57:29,495
- He chased away the Britishers,
single handedly. - Wow!

1074
00:57:29,592 --> 00:57:32,380
Many foreign leaders had supported him.

1075
00:57:32,463 --> 00:57:36,230
He became a victim of tricks
played by national leaders.

1076
00:57:36,432 --> 00:57:39,043
- Nature too was against him.
- Why?

1077
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:42,182
He was last seen flying in an aircraft.

1078
00:57:42,249 --> 00:57:45,374
What happened after that is
known only to your father!

1079
00:57:45,551 --> 00:57:47,584
He'll tell it is confidential
and won't reveal.

1080
00:57:47,794 --> 00:57:52,109
He is the inspiration
for today's gallant youth

1081
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:56,318
He is the reason why the
young men join the army.

1082
00:57:56,403 --> 00:57:59,270
Then he should be the real
'Father of the Nation'

1083
00:58:01,122 --> 00:58:03,672
- Keep quiet and ride the Vehicle.
- Hmm.

1084
00:58:04,969 --> 00:58:07,081
What a majestic man!

1085
00:58:09,439 --> 00:58:12,425
- Who is this shirtless gentleman?
- Father of the nation.

1086
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:14,008
I feel sleepy.

1087
00:58:14,683 --> 00:58:17,045
There you can see
St.Thomas Church.

1088
00:58:17,232 --> 00:58:19,093
Let us sleep on it's steps.

1089
00:58:19,319 --> 00:58:20,874
Did you say St.Thomas Church?

1090
00:58:20,918 --> 00:58:23,521
Why? Can't you get
sleep, near a church?

1091
00:58:23,771 --> 00:58:26,002
- Be quiet and follow.
- Lord! How can I come there?

1092
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:28,225
Go and get my vehicle. Go!

1093
00:58:28,356 --> 00:58:32,720
♫ Jesus calls me... ♫

1094
00:58:34,882 --> 00:58:39,494
These homeless men are sleeping
in standing posture on road side.

1095
00:58:39,527 --> 00:58:41,459
Hey! Whom did you call homeless?

1096
00:58:41,487 --> 00:58:43,183
Do you know? My dad is a VIP.

1097
00:58:43,243 --> 00:58:45,079
He is a landlord.

1098
00:58:45,131 --> 00:58:48,871
I am the God who provides the
land for your dad's grave.

1099
00:58:48,937 --> 00:58:52,504
Which group do you belong? SV or YG?

1100
00:58:52,551 --> 00:58:54,642
- What group is he talking about?
- I know them very well, Lord!

1101
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:56,281
You shut up. I know.

1102
00:58:56,281 --> 00:58:57,709
Hey! Don't you belong to drama troop?

1103
00:58:57,852 --> 00:58:59,080
Your jewels are imitation, right?

1104
00:58:59,094 --> 00:58:59,947
- Hey.
- Imitation?

1105
00:58:59,991 --> 00:59:01,714
These are 24 Carat Gold!

1106
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:03,219
We'll rob all the jewels.

1107
00:59:03,219 --> 00:59:04,219
Hey. Snatch them.

1108
00:59:04,724 --> 00:59:07,089
- No! I warn you. He is an insane guy.
- What?

1109
00:59:07,426 --> 00:59:09,561
Sorry my Lord. He'll take all your lives.

1110
00:59:09,678 --> 00:59:12,303
Are you God Yaman, to take our lives?

1111
00:59:12,823 --> 00:59:15,145
- Stop there! Chitragupta.
- Yes, Lord.

1112
00:59:15,192 --> 00:59:17,803
A guy hits a famous shot in cricket.
What do they call it?

1113
00:59:17,942 --> 00:59:19,418
He is Dhoni. It's Helicopter shot.

1114
00:59:19,474 --> 00:59:21,594
You'll see the Helicopter shot now!

1115
00:59:27,586 --> 00:59:30,223
Hey, God of Rains.
Eat him alive!

1116
00:59:30,259 --> 00:59:31,717
Who called me a theater artist?

1117
00:59:31,723 --> 00:59:33,236
- You rascals!
- My lord!

1118
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:35,677
- The same drink that I had drink earlier!
- No! He sipped it!

1119
00:59:35,823 --> 00:59:36,823
Ugh!

1120
00:59:37,713 --> 00:59:39,364
Hey! Chitragupta!

1121
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:41,630
- He is stealing my vehicle.
- Let it go, my Lord!

1122
00:59:41,773 --> 00:59:44,437
Anyhow we don't have money to refuel it.
Let's walk.

1123
00:59:44,437 --> 00:59:45,959
Hey! You poker-face!

1124
00:59:46,062 --> 00:59:48,802
My father gifted it to me
for clearing 5th grade.

1125
00:59:48,838 --> 00:59:51,223
He ceases my vehicle
like a pawnbroker. Stop him!

1126
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:56,585
Not only vehicle, they will kidnap even
you, if you don't change your attire.

1127
00:59:56,609 --> 00:59:57,609
How to evade it?

1128
00:59:57,708 --> 00:59:58,882
Kumaran Stores

1129
00:59:59,017 --> 01:00:00,054
- Chitragupta!
- My Lord!

1130
01:00:00,109 --> 01:00:02,383
Why these humans are
disrespecting us?

1131
01:00:02,408 --> 01:00:05,757
Because they have
depicted us differently.

1132
01:00:05,772 --> 01:00:07,628
- Dude, where did you stage show today?
- Show?

1133
01:00:07,672 --> 01:00:09,782
Get away before,
I beat you to a pulp.

1134
01:00:17,502 --> 01:00:20,357
Chitragupta! How is it?

1135
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:21,779
Lord!

1136
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:23,488
What is this?

1137
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:24,954
You look like "Nikhil Murugan"

1138
01:00:24,971 --> 01:00:27,331
Hey! You are complaining
every costume I wear!

1139
01:00:27,573 --> 01:00:29,025
Hey, you Hanuman face!

1140
01:00:29,144 --> 01:00:30,718
- How is it?
- Hmm!

1141
01:00:30,810 --> 01:00:31,810
Then what?

1142
01:00:31,908 --> 01:00:35,020
- However, something is missing!
- Mustache, what else!

1143
01:00:35,095 --> 01:00:39,076
The costumer advised, mustache
won't suit this. So I removed it.

1144
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:41,480
(humming a song)

1145
01:00:42,611 --> 01:00:44,163
- What, lord?
- Hmm.

1146
01:00:44,238 --> 01:00:46,344
You brought me to
church just as you said.

1147
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:48,492
I'll do what I say
and tell what I do.

1148
01:00:48,492 --> 01:00:51,193
I won't sleep here.
I'll sleep in our shrine.

1149
01:00:51,213 --> 01:00:52,086
Hey!

1150
01:00:52,511 --> 01:00:54,960
One faith is
not just for humans.

1151
01:00:55,155 --> 01:00:56,794
It's applicable for
us; Gods as well. Come.

1152
01:00:56,794 --> 01:00:58,421
- Leave me. I won't come.
- Come.

1153
01:01:08,111 --> 01:01:12,927
Chitragupta, use every moment
in earth in your favour.

1154
01:01:12,927 --> 01:01:15,544
Even now,
the opportunity knocks your door.

1155
01:01:15,572 --> 01:01:18,687
Use it and kill Yamadharma.

1156
01:01:21,404 --> 01:01:23,349
God! I'm caught!

1157
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:25,171
- Chitragupta!
- Lord!

1158
01:01:25,246 --> 01:01:26,246
What are you doing?

1159
01:01:26,263 --> 01:01:28,374
There was a mosquito
on your neck.

1160
01:01:28,374 --> 01:01:29,888
I came to kill it.

1161
01:01:29,955 --> 01:01:31,225
- Hmm?
- Yes, my Lord!

1162
01:01:31,284 --> 01:01:33,147
Understand a fact.

1163
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:38,967
It is me, God of death,
who will decide your end as well as mine!

1164
01:01:39,009 --> 01:01:39,900
Understood?

1165
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,475
Understood.
Please forgive me, Lord.

1166
01:01:41,665 --> 01:01:44,828
I'm not Jesus to forgive. I am Yaman

1167
01:01:44,895 --> 01:01:46,756
Go and ask Jesus
for forgiveness.

1168
01:01:50,757 --> 01:01:51,579
- Lord!
- Hmm.

1169
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:52,770
-Did you notice this?
- Hmm.

1170
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:55,337
- Life style of human beings
- Yes. Yes.

1171
01:01:55,452 --> 01:01:58,180
It is three times
larger than ours'.

1172
01:01:58,306 --> 01:01:59,426
- Yes, Lord!
- Hmm.

1173
01:01:59,589 --> 01:02:03,450
-Earthly beings live a wealthier life than us.
- Yes.

1174
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:06,843
To be precise,
they enjoy heaven in earth.

1175
01:02:06,843 --> 01:02:07,783
Hmm.

1176
01:02:15,827 --> 01:02:17,361
- Chitragupta!
- Lord!

1177
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:20,831
This is the only thing I
don't like about Lord Brahma.

1178
01:02:20,831 --> 01:02:21,839
What is that, Lord?

1179
01:02:21,894 --> 01:02:24,858
He created his legs on the
top and head on the bottom.

1180
01:02:24,984 --> 01:02:27,850
How will he walk, eat and live? Huh?

1181
01:02:27,964 --> 01:02:29,579
Are you talking like a Yaman?

1182
01:02:29,584 --> 01:02:31,771
- You are intimidating me?
- This is called Yoga, Lord.

1183
01:02:31,771 --> 01:02:32,151
Oh.

1184
01:02:32,168 --> 01:02:34,717
Lifespan will increase
if practiced daily.

1185
01:02:34,768 --> 01:02:35,888
They will remain young.

1186
01:02:35,888 --> 01:02:39,378
If everyone's lifespan
increases, how will I do my job?

1187
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:42,306
Take me to the place
where the poor lives.

1188
01:02:42,373 --> 01:02:43,501
I want to meet them.

1189
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:46,217
- Do you want to go there?
- Yes. You filthy cockroach! Let's go.

1190
01:02:46,332 --> 01:02:47,462
- Lord!
- Take me.

1191
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:57,243
- Lord!
- Hmm.

1192
01:02:57,243 --> 01:02:59,109
This is the poor's
place, you've asked for.

1193
01:02:59,144 --> 01:03:01,077
- But it doesn't seem so.
- Looks deceive.

1194
01:03:01,155 --> 01:03:03,588
You've to live their life to understand.
Let us drink tea.

1195
01:03:03,657 --> 01:03:05,676
Hey! They adulterate it with tamarind
seeds, I don't want it.

1196
01:03:05,676 --> 01:03:08,664
- Don't argue. Come, sit.
- Please listen to me.

1197
01:03:08,664 --> 01:03:10,289
- Two tea, please.
- Okay.

1198
01:03:10,626 --> 01:03:12,001
Sir, what is your name?

1199
01:03:12,291 --> 01:03:15,357
- Ponmani.
- Your final bell will ring in 2 days.

1200
01:03:15,364 --> 01:03:17,011
- What 2 minutes?
- You come up there and ask.

1201
01:03:17,011 --> 01:03:18,084
- Nothing. You keep reading.
- Hmm.

1202
01:03:18,144 --> 01:03:19,442
- What is he blabbering about?
- Hey!

1203
01:03:19,493 --> 01:03:20,633
- Go away, you Bug!

1204
01:03:20,653 --> 01:03:21,745
Lord! How is the tea?

1205
01:03:21,745 --> 01:03:23,457
Yuck!

1206
01:03:23,489 --> 01:03:25,073
- Who is this baby?
- Okay, Mom.

1207
01:03:25,073 --> 01:03:27,110
- Give chocolate to everyone!
- Uncle, take.

1208
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:28,725
- Is it your birthday?
- Yes.

1209
01:03:28,725 --> 01:03:31,607
- Happy birthday to you.
- Thank you.

1210
01:03:31,754 --> 01:03:34,380
Drink fast, we don't have money.
Let's leave.

1211
01:03:34,424 --> 01:03:37,045
Happy Birthday.
- Happy returns of the day.

1212
01:03:37,144 --> 01:03:39,757
Tell me what you want, I shall gift you.

1213
01:03:39,757 --> 01:03:42,628
I like my dad's bike.

1214
01:03:42,695 --> 01:03:46,065
I can't give bike to your dad.
Ask me what you want.

1215
01:03:46,065 --> 01:03:48,781
I love puppy a lot.

1216
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:50,117
Just a Puppy.

1217
01:03:50,343 --> 01:03:53,470
I'll give it now.
Om Kalabairava!

1218
01:03:53,712 --> 01:03:55,087
Have it.

1219
01:03:55,877 --> 01:03:59,243
You can play with it as like you want.

1220
01:03:59,398 --> 01:04:01,519
- Chitragupta, convey thanks to Bairavar.
- Hmm.

1221
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:18,740
OMG!

1222
01:04:22,029 --> 01:04:23,688
- Mom!
- Honey!

1223
01:04:23,688 --> 01:04:24,688
Hey!

1224
01:04:28,755 --> 01:04:29,755
God!

1225
01:04:31,423 --> 01:04:34,799
The job of bringing him
to earth is done at last.

1226
01:04:34,978 --> 01:04:36,044
Senseless idiot!

1227
01:04:36,063 --> 01:04:38,933
Won't you watch the baby down there.
I'll teach you lesson when you come to me.

1228
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:42,966
Your act was marvelous

1229
01:04:43,018 --> 01:04:45,636
You stopped the lorry
just like that. Wow!

1230
01:04:45,636 --> 01:04:47,240
- How did you do that?
- I am Yaman.

1231
01:04:47,443 --> 01:04:49,993
- Hey Chitragupta, Yamadharma.
- Who is that?

1232
01:04:50,155 --> 01:04:51,990
Gosh! Lord Shiva. Hi uncle.

1233
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:53,360
Come up here!

1234
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,360
Up there?

1235
01:04:54,595 --> 01:04:56,774
- Why is he calling us, standing on a leg?
- Lets go.

1236
01:04:56,818 --> 01:04:58,448
I am coming uncle.

1237
01:05:15,248 --> 01:05:20,370
I summon my salutation to
the God of the universe.

1238
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:23,740
I'm not here for your salute.
I'm here for taking your soul.

1239
01:05:24,069 --> 01:05:25,702
Oh! Lord!

1240
01:05:25,762 --> 01:05:29,205
What crime did my son commit
as to deserve death?

1241
01:05:29,205 --> 01:05:30,547
What crime?

1242
01:05:30,694 --> 01:05:32,907
He gave life those
who are supposed to die.

1243
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:39,384
- Did I give life?
- What did you do? Is it true?

1244
01:05:39,393 --> 01:05:41,520
Don't ask him. Ask me. I will tell.

1245
01:05:41,651 --> 01:05:43,026
Brahma, Vishnu and myself.

1246
01:05:43,197 --> 01:05:46,072
He falsified the book of
deaths written by three of us.

1247
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:51,131
There is no other way than killing
him, for his heinous crime.

1248
01:05:51,131 --> 01:05:53,771
My lord! Shiva!
Please do not do like that!

1249
01:05:53,862 --> 01:05:58,042
Lord Shiva, I just saved
the life of a little girl!

1250
01:05:58,205 --> 01:05:59,835
- Damn it!
- What?

1251
01:05:59,871 --> 01:06:01,765
You don't know
anything than to eat.

1252
01:06:01,765 --> 01:06:05,131
- I can wash hands after eating.
- That's the only thing you know.

1253
01:06:05,131 --> 01:06:07,885
You have not saved just the
child, whose time is over.

1254
01:06:07,913 --> 01:06:10,294
You saved the life of demon
who is supposed to die along.

1255
01:06:10,294 --> 01:06:11,294
What!

1256
01:06:13,207 --> 01:06:15,078
Look at their destined fate!

1257
01:06:58,830 --> 01:07:03,594
This junkie has saved the life of demon
along with the child's life. Understood?

1258
01:07:03,629 --> 01:07:08,248
Hey! You have got the post of
Yaman to take lives. Not to save.

1259
01:07:08,248 --> 01:07:13,750
Because of his foolishness, many
innocent souls will become his victims

1260
01:07:13,984 --> 01:07:17,353
Look at the cost of your
mistake you've committed.

1261
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:22,117
Is he Lord Shiva or theater operator?
playing the movies alternatively!

1262
01:07:39,953 --> 01:07:40,953
- Hey!
- Boss.

1263
01:07:41,256 --> 01:07:43,705
You've been driving for a long time.
Rest for a while.

1264
01:07:43,765 --> 01:07:44,765
okay sir.

1265
01:07:49,403 --> 01:07:53,652
Hey! I sent you out for job,
because you're educated.

1266
01:07:53,666 --> 01:07:54,384
Please leave me sir.

1267
01:07:54,444 --> 01:07:58,029
In the pretext of working in IT company,
are you roaming with other caste guys?

1268
01:07:58,029 --> 01:07:58,914
No sir.

1269
01:07:58,982 --> 01:08:03,078
On what grounds are we inferior to you?
In education? earning?

1270
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:06,507
She loves me.
I love her.

1271
01:08:07,073 --> 01:08:10,191
- What else do you want?
- Please leave him, sir.

1272
01:08:12,074 --> 01:08:13,622
CASTE!

1273
01:08:16,262 --> 01:08:20,253
Sir, please. Aravind is a good guy.
Please leave him

1274
01:08:20,253 --> 01:08:23,484
What sort of person
murders like this?

1275
01:08:23,528 --> 01:08:26,151
- Chitragupta, we are caught.
- Yes, Lord!

1276
01:08:26,151 --> 01:08:29,660
Lord Shiva is doing a direct inquiry.
Look he is doing something

1277
01:08:31,983 --> 01:08:33,035
Hey!

1278
01:08:34,057 --> 01:08:37,805
I'm not born to achieve.
I'm born for my caste.

1279
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:38,793
Die!

1280
01:08:49,435 --> 01:08:51,819
- Did we save this Demon?
- That's what he said.

1281
01:08:53,157 --> 01:08:54,685
How can I leave him unpunished?

1282
01:08:55,252 --> 01:08:57,624
Just shut your mouth.

1283
01:08:57,763 --> 01:08:59,385
You are talking too much
just for saving a kid.

1284
01:08:59,619 --> 01:09:03,241
94 school kids died were not belong
to your book. Where did you go then?

1285
01:09:03,416 --> 01:09:07,538
- What?
- Are you blaming me for your negligence?

1286
01:09:07,772 --> 01:09:10,399
Evading the question
just like humans

1287
01:09:10,482 --> 01:09:13,768
If you aren't capable forfeit
your snake and trident to sour sons

1288
01:09:13,966 --> 01:09:15,575
And perform a penance in Himalayas.

1289
01:09:15,783 --> 01:09:17,019
Why are you tormenting us?

1290
01:09:17,325 --> 01:09:19,290
I'm not sure about your
governing skills...

1291
01:09:19,559 --> 01:09:21,587
But sure you are witty.

1292
01:09:21,825 --> 01:09:24,652
Its my survival skill, My Lord.

1293
01:09:24,652 --> 01:09:27,559
Are you mocking me,
when you are supposed to answer?

1294
01:09:27,853 --> 01:09:29,073
Lord Eshwara!

1295
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:34,471
We will give second thought
to hit our beloved son...

1296
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:36,921
Who gave the authority to hit him?

1297
01:09:36,921 --> 01:09:39,677
Are you questioning the authority
of the sole authoritarian?

1298
01:09:41,589 --> 01:09:43,599
You are the one who made this dumbo

1299
01:09:44,175 --> 01:09:45,818
to sit on the throne.

1300
01:09:47,318 --> 01:09:50,002
- You have to pay the penalty.
- Lord!

1301
01:09:50,002 --> 01:09:51,122
I accept it, my Lord!

1302
01:09:51,484 --> 01:09:54,009
- Turn into ashes.
- Dad... - My Lord!

1303
01:09:55,862 --> 01:09:56,862
Oh my God!

1304
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,120
- My Lord?
- Yes?

1305
01:10:01,701 --> 01:10:04,546
Why did you punish him for my mistakes?

1306
01:10:04,851 --> 01:10:06,722
It will not end with your father.

1307
01:10:07,362 --> 01:10:10,580
If you don't fix up your errors

1308
01:10:10,713 --> 01:10:12,577
and seize his soul in six days...

1309
01:10:12,783 --> 01:10:15,700
I will destroy this Yamalogam
and construct a new one.

1310
01:10:15,723 --> 01:10:17,732
I swear!!!

1311
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:30,925
Om namah Shivaya!

1312
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,211
- Om namah shivaya!
- Excuse me.

1313
01:10:34,649 --> 01:10:38,384
Lord, My daughter got saved from
a great mishap by a whisker.

1314
01:10:39,757 --> 01:10:42,930
I’m pretty much scared
to sent her out !

1315
01:10:43,222 --> 01:10:45,780
That's why I thought of meeting
you and getting blessings from you

1316
01:10:46,346 --> 01:10:48,484
so that I can feel relieved.

1317
01:10:52,894 --> 01:10:55,723
Who saved your daughter
from that accident?

1318
01:10:56,615 --> 01:10:58,631
I'm not sure of that.

1319
01:10:58,931 --> 01:11:01,134
But he came like a Lord
himself and saved my daughter.

1320
01:11:05,167 --> 01:11:06,708
But as per your daughter’s destiny

1321
01:11:06,878 --> 01:11:08,737
she died in the accident.

1322
01:11:11,757 --> 01:11:12,862
As you said...

1323
01:11:13,074 --> 01:11:15,645
the one who saved
your daughter is

1324
01:11:15,849 --> 01:11:18,200
none any other one
but the God Himself.

1325
01:11:19,476 --> 01:11:22,770
That too by the Lord Yamadharma,
the one who never fails the righteousness.

1326
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:27,620
Lord Yama?
- Yes.

1327
01:11:28,136 --> 01:11:32,734
The Lord of yamalogam vested with
the power of seizing humanly lives.

1328
01:11:32,916 --> 01:11:34,674
The one who is supposed
to end the lives

1329
01:11:34,831 --> 01:11:36,468
has saved a life...

1330
01:11:36,983 --> 01:11:40,155
That supposedly means that
Anbazhagi defies destiny.

1331
01:11:43,084 --> 01:11:44,237
Lord Yama is to be pitied.

1332
01:11:44,770 --> 01:11:47,149
As he failed to end the life of Anbazhagi

1333
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:50,109
he is answerable to Lord Shiva.

1334
01:12:04,443 --> 01:12:06,243
What is this, my Lord?

1335
01:12:07,123 --> 01:12:09,604
Instead of sitting on the throne,
you are seated down here?

1336
01:12:10,324 --> 01:12:12,764
I'm unable to shoulder this
burden of responsibility

1337
01:12:14,001 --> 01:12:17,838
I'm afraid that I'll succumb
to the situational pressure.

1338
01:12:18,768 --> 01:12:22,829
I'm not eligible to sit
on the throne anymore.

1339
01:12:25,252 --> 01:12:27,120
You are indeed eligible, my Lord.

1340
01:12:28,168 --> 01:12:30,273
You lost owing to my conspiracy.

1341
01:12:31,791 --> 01:12:33,220
How could have you conspired

1342
01:12:33,716 --> 01:12:35,293
when it was me who saved the kid.

1343
01:12:35,589 --> 01:12:36,589
What's your role?

1344
01:12:37,196 --> 01:12:39,080
In an attempt to make you
descend down to the earth

1345
01:12:39,385 --> 01:12:41,029
I manipulated the Book of life and death...

1346
01:12:42,436 --> 01:12:43,769
and stopped the loss of lives.

1347
01:12:44,559 --> 01:12:46,679
Why did you stoop so low?

1348
01:12:47,414 --> 01:12:49,382
To get to the throne

1349
01:12:49,942 --> 01:12:51,759
I heeded to the advice of

1350
01:12:52,349 --> 01:12:53,952
the human and a fellow from my
caste, Ko. Rangasamy

1351
01:12:54,572 --> 01:12:56,308
My desire for the throne

1352
01:12:56,782 --> 01:12:58,811
may end up in the
devastation of Yamalogam.

1353
01:12:59,269 --> 01:13:00,269
You trifle!

1354
01:13:01,282 --> 01:13:05,039
You stooped as low as the earthly beings.

1355
01:13:05,353 --> 01:13:08,247
Had you shared your
desire for the throne with me

1356
01:13:08,294 --> 01:13:09,824
I'd have passed it to you.

1357
01:13:10,008 --> 01:13:12,291
- Go take the throne.
- Forgive me, my Lord.

1358
01:13:12,291 --> 01:13:13,291
What do you mean?

1359
01:13:14,465 --> 01:13:15,863
Forgive me, my Lord.

1360
01:13:16,443 --> 01:13:20,352
Chitragupta, you are worshipped by humans.

1361
01:13:20,874 --> 01:13:24,156
But here you are
pleading guilty to me.

1362
01:13:25,185 --> 01:13:29,939
Indeed people presume us
to be slap stick comedians.

1363
01:13:30,307 --> 01:13:31,980
Why should we be so formal?

1364
01:13:32,266 --> 01:13:33,266
Forget that.

1365
01:13:33,458 --> 01:13:36,959
I'm just concerned about the threat of Lord Shiva
who is determined to destroy this Yamalogam.

1366
01:13:37,264 --> 01:13:38,724
We have to stop it any cost.

1367
01:13:39,125 --> 01:13:41,542
Our primary task is to rat out the demon.

1368
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:43,885
Broadcast his bio.

1369
01:13:44,624 --> 01:13:45,624
Your wish, my Lord.

1370
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:52,260
RTO is obliged to
scrutinize the vehicles.

1371
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:54,284
Will you desert the vehicles in fear?

1372
01:13:54,952 --> 01:13:56,800
You should have rammed him down,

1373
01:13:58,253 --> 01:14:03,045
You dared to stop it despite
knowing that it's my truck.

1374
01:14:30,518 --> 01:14:32,659
This sapling will yield better.

1375
01:14:47,388 --> 01:14:48,388
No!!!

1376
01:14:48,485 --> 01:14:50,184
Stop it!!

1377
01:14:50,615 --> 01:14:52,948
Why is he so brutal?

1378
01:14:53,626 --> 01:14:54,626
What shall we do with him?

1379
01:14:54,879 --> 01:14:56,013
With him?

1380
01:14:56,651 --> 01:15:02,062
I will prey him tonight with my noose.

1381
01:15:02,685 --> 01:15:04,746
It has tired me out.

1382
01:15:04,897 --> 01:15:07,247
Shall we have two pitchers of...

1383
01:15:09,389 --> 01:15:10,071
Aye, my Lord

1384
01:15:10,409 --> 01:15:12,309
- Shall we go to your quarters?
- Yes, my Lord.

1385
01:15:12,578 --> 01:15:13,578
Hold on Chitu...

1386
01:15:13,813 --> 01:15:15,851
- Yes, my Lord.
- While you conspired against me...

1387
01:15:16,022 --> 01:15:17,812
Who were your accomplices?

1388
01:15:19,386 --> 01:15:21,263
These fellows...
Chitragupta...

1389
01:15:21,701 --> 01:15:24,721
Had you made efforts on your own,
you could have captured the throne.

1390
01:15:24,816 --> 01:15:26,538
Why did you trust these guys?

1391
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:31,750
Descend down to Marina beach
and carry loads of sand.

1392
01:15:31,919 --> 01:15:33,390
That's your sentence.

1393
01:15:33,519 --> 01:15:34,694
We don't know to swim, my Lord.

1394
01:15:34,891 --> 01:15:35,891
It adds up to my convenience.

1395
01:15:36,195 --> 01:15:38,414
I order you to drown till death.

1396
01:15:38,616 --> 01:15:40,764
Get lost.
Or I shall whip you to death.

1397
01:15:40,908 --> 01:15:41,908
What's it?

1398
01:15:41,919 --> 01:15:43,650
The foreign liquor...

1399
01:15:43,988 --> 01:15:46,366
- I shall console my mom...
- Fine...

1400
01:15:46,366 --> 01:15:47,801
- And grab some complementary dishes.
- Fine

1401
01:15:54,275 --> 01:15:55,167
My Lord...

1402
01:15:55,261 --> 01:15:57,118
How can you let me
sob in solitude?

1403
01:15:57,182 --> 01:15:58,664
Why did you leave me?

1404
01:16:01,051 --> 01:16:04,729
Lord Eshwara,
burn me to ashes and swallow me.

1405
01:16:05,677 --> 01:16:06,677
Mother...

1406
01:16:10,581 --> 01:16:11,581
Why are you gazing at me?

1407
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:14,274
I can spot a change in you.

1408
01:16:14,629 --> 01:16:16,570
It's the mustache.
It's was too itchy.

1409
01:16:17,185 --> 01:16:19,455
That's for the court,
not for the home.

1410
01:16:20,039 --> 01:16:21,551
You need not worry, mother.

1411
01:16:21,916 --> 01:16:23,604
I will bail out father at any cost

1412
01:16:23,782 --> 01:16:25,095
and will bring him to you.

1413
01:16:25,209 --> 01:16:26,547
- I swear on you.
- Son..

1414
01:16:26,789 --> 01:16:30,048
He is not imprisoned
in a prison to bail out

1415
01:16:30,286 --> 01:16:31,286
It's not possible.

1416
01:16:31,335 --> 01:16:33,719
Lord Shiva turned your father
to ashes and swallowed him up.

1417
01:16:33,832 --> 01:16:35,603
I'm not bothered about
his place of imprisonment.

1418
01:16:35,819 --> 01:16:38,438
I'll bail him out at any cost.

1419
01:16:38,438 --> 01:16:39,438
I swear on you.

1420
01:16:39,513 --> 01:16:40,338
- Son...
- Yes, mom...

1421
01:16:40,338 --> 01:16:42,345
Why are you using the unchaste language?

1422
01:16:42,345 --> 01:16:43,335
My bad...

1423
01:16:43,359 --> 01:16:44,994
This is the easily dialect to pick up.

1424
01:16:45,178 --> 01:16:46,178
So I hooked on to it.

1425
01:16:46,209 --> 01:16:48,678
Forget this.
Sleep peacefully.

1426
01:16:48,945 --> 01:16:50,212
I shall bail out father.

1427
01:16:50,383 --> 01:16:51,825
I shall leave.

1428
01:16:52,796 --> 01:16:54,475
How can I talk about this to a mother?

1429
01:16:54,991 --> 01:16:55,991
Let's give it a try.

1430
01:16:57,903 --> 01:16:59,767
- Mom...
- Yes, son...

1431
01:16:59,916 --> 01:17:01,926
Please don't take me wrong.

1432
01:17:02,299 --> 01:17:03,460
Not at all.
Speak out.

1433
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:05,933
You are saddened by the loss of father.

1434
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:07,922
Are you sure that you won't take it wrong.

1435
01:17:08,098 --> 01:17:09,397
I won't.
Tell me.

1436
01:17:09,597 --> 01:17:13,469
Drink some liquor from dad's inventory...

1437
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:14,994
Doze off after having it.

1438
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:16,250
You will have a good sleep.

1439
01:17:16,414 --> 01:17:18,954
- Son!!
- It's not a crime, mom. Have it.

1440
01:17:20,384 --> 01:17:21,454
Coincidence!

1441
01:17:21,454 --> 01:17:23,818
As I was mourning for father...

1442
01:17:24,051 --> 01:17:26,634
- I was in the course of second drink...
- What?

1443
01:17:27,426 --> 01:17:29,024
In the pretext of mourning...

1444
01:17:29,375 --> 01:17:30,546
You were having a blast?

1445
01:17:30,949 --> 01:17:32,008
Drink to the max and throw up.

1446
01:17:32,172 --> 01:17:33,504
I will send the maid to clean

1447
01:17:34,371 --> 01:17:36,012
Will I make it to the last drink?

1448
01:17:36,572 --> 01:17:38,133
Forgive me my Lord.

1449
01:17:43,716 --> 01:17:46,388
You habituated this after the
demise of my father or prior to that?

1450
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:49,738
You presumption isn't right.
It's because of the solitude.

1451
01:17:49,794 --> 01:17:51,103
The empty bottle gives a testament.

1452
01:18:03,144 --> 01:18:05,505
- I shall thrash him.
- Look at this, my Lord...

1453
01:18:05,625 --> 01:18:07,903
He is batting for the
liquor prohibition in public

1454
01:18:08,137 --> 01:18:10,859
Where as he is having a sound
sleep after having foreign liquor.

1455
01:18:10,921 --> 01:18:13,315
They voice out in favor
of liquor prohibition

1456
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:17,032
and have foreign brews to
cancel out the tiredness.

1457
01:18:17,353 --> 01:18:18,682
It doesn't matter now.

1458
01:18:18,868 --> 01:18:21,491
Watch out how my noose
preys on his soul.

1459
01:18:22,038 --> 01:18:23,587
Bless me Lord Shiva.

1460
01:18:36,703 --> 01:18:38,686
- Chitragupta...
- What's is it, my Lord?

1461
01:18:38,711 --> 01:18:40,658
- What's wrong?
-  Is it the noose of death or a lame thread?

1462
01:18:40,959 --> 01:18:41,959
It's not able to hold on to his body.

1463
01:18:42,508 --> 01:18:44,053
Are you mocking me?

1464
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:48,480
He may cheat my noose...

1465
01:18:48,786 --> 01:18:51,508
But he can't duck my mace

1466
01:18:51,899 --> 01:18:54,145
Bless me my Lord.

1467
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:58,328
I'll crack up his bones.

1468
01:19:01,809 --> 01:19:03,681
Massage a bit lower.

1469
01:19:04,659 --> 01:19:06,128
- Massage?
- Lord

1470
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:08,531
- He is mocking at your blows.
- Yes.

1471
01:19:09,551 --> 01:19:12,146
Seems Lord Shiva was right
about his demonic traits.

1472
01:19:12,146 --> 01:19:14,033
How shall we drag him to Yamalogam?

1473
01:19:14,171 --> 01:19:15,936
That's upto your skills.

1474
01:19:16,283 --> 01:19:17,283
Bingo!

1475
01:19:17,703 --> 01:19:18,703
Skills?

1476
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:22,252
Watch out this!
I will beat him to a pulp.

1477
01:19:22,838 --> 01:19:24,390
I did say 'the lower part'

1478
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:25,870
Who are you?
Mongers?

1479
01:19:26,264 --> 01:19:28,064
Are you trying to
snatch my boss' chain?

1480
01:19:28,494 --> 01:19:29,812
Get him off my sight.

1481
01:19:29,812 --> 01:19:31,606
I'm just the accomplice.

1482
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:36,595
You can't touch even touch his
shadow as long as I'm with him.

1483
01:19:37,089 --> 01:19:38,958
Vanish before the humans gang up.

1484
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:40,430
He has caught hold of me.

1485
01:19:51,690 --> 01:19:52,950
Shall I serve you
horse gram saute?

1486
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:54,990
It will boost my stamina.

1487
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:55,990
That's the sole purpose.

1488
01:19:59,063 --> 01:20:00,063
Get the phone.

1489
01:20:06,932 --> 01:20:08,681
Someone fetch him some water.

1490
01:20:10,544 --> 01:20:12,861
Hold your breath.

1491
01:20:33,443 --> 01:20:35,909
No one is gonna grab your water

1492
01:20:36,222 --> 01:20:37,222
Take small gulps

1493
01:20:39,193 --> 01:20:40,193
Silly fellow

1494
01:20:44,574 --> 01:20:46,053
Greetings, sir!!

1495
01:20:55,056 --> 01:20:56,497
Fall on his feet and seek his blessings.

1496
01:20:58,988 --> 01:21:00,352
He has come.

1497
01:21:00,808 --> 01:21:02,074
He has arrived.

1498
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:04,061
- Sir!!!
- Welcome!

1499
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:08,497
The opposition parties are condemning
you blaming the Virudhunagar clash.

1500
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:10,218
But you are seldom
commenting on it.

1501
01:21:10,446 --> 01:21:14,088
Shall we publish with the headlines,
' Atrocities of Ayya in Virudhunagar?

1502
01:21:14,374 --> 01:21:16,866
If that's your wish go ahead.

1503
01:21:17,158 --> 01:21:20,112
Is that true that you have
a mistress in Chennai?

1504
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:22,898
Are you a reporter or something else?

1505
01:21:23,054 --> 01:21:24,820
Please answer my question.

1506
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:29,639
'Just to evade the corruption and criminals
charges against you and your son...

1507
01:21:30,005 --> 01:21:32,438
you are running this political outfit'
This is public opinion.

1508
01:21:32,671 --> 01:21:34,051
What's your view on this?

1509
01:21:34,167 --> 01:21:36,328
I never comment on rumors.

1510
01:21:36,779 --> 01:21:39,520
I believe in universal brotherhood
void any caste or faith.

1511
01:21:39,821 --> 01:21:44,096
Your employees are hired
only from your caste.

1512
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:46,090
How can you claim you
as a man for everyone?

1513
01:21:46,896 --> 01:21:48,328
- Bala!
- Sir!

1514
01:21:48,983 --> 01:21:50,682
Here you are.
Come.

1515
01:21:50,926 --> 01:21:51,926
Come closer.

1516
01:21:53,148 --> 01:21:54,148
He is Bala.

1517
01:21:54,233 --> 01:21:55,233
He is my car driver.

1518
01:21:55,267 --> 01:21:59,090
He travels most of the time alongside me
in my personal and professional life.

1519
01:21:59,450 --> 01:22:02,296
If I were a caste obsessed
person as per your allegation

1520
01:22:02,671 --> 01:22:04,029
Don't we have any
drivers in our caste?

1521
01:22:04,596 --> 01:22:07,751
You are mocking me as you are from a
pro political party channel...

1522
01:22:08,298 --> 01:22:10,876
don't spoil the ethics of
the press for TRP ratings

1523
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:14,142
- Thanks... I'm done for the day.
- Sir!!!

1524
01:22:17,630 --> 01:22:18,630
Thiru...

1525
01:22:19,191 --> 01:22:22,215
Summon the three reporters
to our party office

1526
01:22:22,899 --> 01:22:24,724
How dare you ask such questions?
I'll thrash you.

1527
01:22:25,401 --> 01:22:26,401
Idiot!

1528
01:22:35,571 --> 01:22:37,487
Greetings, sir!

1529
01:22:40,279 --> 01:22:42,391
Greetings to all!

1530
01:22:42,391 --> 01:22:44,646
- Sir!
- I asked you to meet me at the orchard.

1531
01:22:44,985 --> 01:22:46,801
- We shall discuss over there.
- Fine, sir.

1532
01:22:46,842 --> 01:22:47,752
- Thiru!
- Sir?

1533
01:22:47,776 --> 01:22:50,987
Are the arrangements done for the feast?

1534
01:22:59,915 --> 01:23:02,115
- Greetings, sir.
- How are you?

1535
01:23:02,574 --> 01:23:03,869
- Greetings, sir
- Welcome TPS.

1536
01:23:05,037 --> 01:23:07,743
- How are you?
- I'm here to make sure we're fine.

1537
01:23:08,046 --> 01:23:09,228
Why do you need my aid?

1538
01:23:09,522 --> 01:23:11,732
We don't have a
strong leadership.

1539
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,948
If we don't form an ally,
we may even lose the deposit.

1540
01:23:15,386 --> 01:23:18,634
So we are here before the
opposition party makes a move.

1541
01:23:18,972 --> 01:23:21,674
So you have assessed your
party's situation correctly.

1542
01:23:23,477 --> 01:23:24,860
Else I would be knocking your doors.

1543
01:23:24,945 --> 01:23:25,945
Fine!

1544
01:23:26,474 --> 01:23:27,474
50 seats...

1545
01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:29,091
5 billion rupees.

1546
01:23:29,356 --> 01:23:30,356
Ministerial positions.

1547
01:23:31,979 --> 01:23:32,979
We will have a word with CM...

1548
01:23:33,304 --> 01:23:35,031
- and will get back to you.
- Definitely.

1549
01:23:35,203 --> 01:23:37,263
Please have a thorough discussion

1550
01:23:38,977 --> 01:23:41,739
Mr. TPS! The opposition
party is also queuing up.

1551
01:23:41,945 --> 01:23:42,945
They are void of leadership as well.

1552
01:23:43,576 --> 01:23:44,576
Hurry up.

1553
01:23:45,859 --> 01:23:47,272
Expecting a fruitful reply.

1554
01:23:47,637 --> 01:23:49,149
- Welcome.
-Sir!!

1555
01:23:49,472 --> 01:23:53,219
Would your meeting just before the elections
lay a foundation for political ally?

1556
01:23:53,396 --> 01:23:54,396
We can't comment on it now.

1557
01:23:55,011 --> 01:23:57,150
Party's high commission
will discuss about it

1558
01:23:57,511 --> 01:23:58,511
and come with a
fruitful decision.

1559
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:00,482
A council meeting for nothing.

1560
01:24:00,975 --> 01:24:03,162
One on one dialogues is
itself a boring affair.

1561
01:24:03,518 --> 01:24:05,208
This is council meeting is a dull affair.

1562
01:24:05,510 --> 01:24:06,510
Fine...

1563
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:08,266
Dear ministers...

1564
01:24:08,667 --> 01:24:10,333
To save Yamaloga...

1565
01:24:10,833 --> 01:24:12,875
Come up with new ideas.

1566
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:14,564
Do you know something?

1567
01:24:14,834 --> 01:24:16,120
If this Yamalogam
is not fixed back and restored

1568
01:24:16,282 --> 01:24:18,444
 in a span of six days...

1569
01:24:18,567 --> 01:24:21,720
We will have to face
the wrath of Lord Shiva.

1570
01:24:23,192 --> 01:24:24,924
Don't beat about the bush.

1571
01:24:25,492 --> 01:24:26,919
You are summoned for
the very purpose.

1572
01:24:27,127 --> 01:24:28,294
Come with some innovative ideas.

1573
01:24:28,447 --> 01:24:31,309
I think its better to have a
discussion after 6 in the evening

1574
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:34,282
rather discussing it now.

1575
01:24:34,853 --> 01:24:35,853
No.. after 8.

1576
01:24:39,128 --> 01:24:42,899
Best thoughts surface
after eight at night.

1577
01:24:42,915 --> 01:24:46,518
How? To get me high

1578
01:24:46,543 --> 01:24:48,512
and sleep kicking my face.

1579
01:24:48,544 --> 01:24:53,496
Next morning you'd be proud that
you slept kicking Yamadharma's face

1580
01:24:53,576 --> 01:24:57,055
Then they'd ask for the same.
So shut up.

1581
01:24:57,380 --> 01:24:59,785
My lord. Which accent of
Tamil are you speaking?

1582
01:24:59,809 --> 01:25:01,793
- We are unable to decipher it.
- I was in Chennai for few days.

1583
01:25:01,919 --> 01:25:03,283
Hence the Rayapuram accent.

1584
01:25:03,371 --> 01:25:05,365
- Give me idea in this meeting.
- My lord.

1585
01:25:05,390 --> 01:25:07,436
I've a good idea.

1586
01:25:07,603 --> 01:25:09,464
Say it before you take the fruit.

1587
01:25:09,536 --> 01:25:11,305
I'll decide if your idea is good.

1588
01:25:11,330 --> 01:25:13,361
In that case,
shall I take a half an hour more?

1589
01:25:13,386 --> 01:25:16,472
I can see that you think only about
the fruit. I don't want your idea.

1590
01:25:17,051 --> 01:25:19,908
I've a good idea.

1591
01:25:20,336 --> 01:25:24,329
Chitragupta. Who is he?
What language is he speaking?

1592
01:25:24,337 --> 01:25:28,527
- The prime language of India.
- This should be the last time.

1593
01:25:28,805 --> 01:25:29,654
- My lord.
- What is it?

1594
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:31,282
- I've a nice idea.
- Wow.

1595
01:25:31,306 --> 01:25:34,147
In 2nd century...

1596
01:25:34,646 --> 01:25:36,766
My father was spoiled
because of such ideas.

1597
01:25:36,791 --> 01:25:39,393
- For past one hour...
- My lord, I've an excellent idea.

1598
01:25:39,498 --> 01:25:40,140
What is it?

1599
01:25:40,593 --> 01:25:44,870
Picking every individual soul and
catching it with the noose and escorting

1600
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:50,680
to the court and punish them
within six days is not possible.

1601
01:25:51,101 --> 01:25:55,382
How about taking out the person
responsible for this entire issue?

1602
01:25:55,705 --> 01:25:57,927
- Who?
- Lord Shiva.

1603
01:26:00,251 --> 01:26:04,148
- Let's take him out and party.
- Shut up you, idiot.

1604
01:26:05,051 --> 01:26:08,391
Do you think it's possible
to take Lord Shiva out?

1605
01:26:09,868 --> 01:26:11,983
Welcome. Hail Lord Shiva!

1606
01:26:12,007 --> 01:26:15,237
- Do you want to take me out?
- Lord Shiva. I did not.

1607
01:26:15,377 --> 01:26:17,790
I'll destroy you.
Mind your business, dumbo.

1608
01:26:17,885 --> 01:26:21,393
You scold me instead of them.

1609
01:26:21,441 --> 01:26:24,186
He's already angry on me.
And you guys adding fuel to the fire. Get out.

1610
01:26:24,584 --> 01:26:25,322
Out.

1611
01:26:26,664 --> 01:26:29,906
They made Lord Shiva scold me.

1612
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:31,413
I feel bad.

1613
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,086
Nobody left.

1614
01:26:35,868 --> 01:26:37,479
- Ragavendra.
- Sir.

1615
01:26:37,765 --> 01:26:38,971
Take that fruit.

1616
01:26:40,273 --> 01:26:43,812
- He's in mood. Here it is.
- I can't reach it. Give it to him.

1617
01:26:44,582 --> 01:26:46,756
- Not for me?
- Now you give it to me.

1618
01:26:48,277 --> 01:26:50,070
I'll kill you all with the fruit.

1619
01:26:50,482 --> 01:26:53,244
Is it yamalogam or a bar?

1620
01:26:54,951 --> 01:26:55,784
Idiots.

1621
01:26:56,657 --> 01:26:58,093
- My lord.
- What?

1622
01:26:58,641 --> 01:27:02,272
Why don't you reconsider my idea?

1623
01:27:04,856 --> 01:27:06,197
- Chitragupta.
- My lord.

1624
01:27:06,467 --> 01:27:08,467
I thought you've changed for good.

1625
01:27:08,832 --> 01:27:12,656
But you never will.
Take this and stand back.

1626
01:27:13,275 --> 01:27:15,906
He's advising.
Crown slips too.

1627
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,213
You are the one
spoiling everyone here.

1628
01:27:18,816 --> 01:27:21,049
Whom shall I ask then?

1629
01:27:23,890 --> 01:27:26,195
They're the right people.

1630
01:27:27,101 --> 01:27:30,191
- Kesava.
- My lord.

1631
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:36,230
- Summon that four here.
- Yes, my lord.

1632
01:27:56,400 --> 01:28:00,416
First of all I thank you
four for accepting my invite.

1633
01:28:01,978 --> 01:28:03,319
Who's that monster?

1634
01:28:03,875 --> 01:28:06,168
Leader of a Pro caste political
party, Kumaradasan.

1635
01:28:10,218 --> 01:28:11,718
What the hell are you talking about?

1636
01:28:12,845 --> 01:28:16,505
He is crazy and his
people follow him.

1637
01:28:16,570 --> 01:28:18,249
Don't they have brains?

1638
01:28:18,273 --> 01:28:21,479
- How do I know?
- We four struggled for people.

1639
01:28:21,940 --> 01:28:24,690
You commit the mistake and
why do you ask for our advise?

1640
01:28:24,913 --> 01:28:25,764
Idiot.

1641
01:28:25,970 --> 01:28:27,336
- Chitragupta.
- My lord.

1642
01:28:27,765 --> 01:28:30,959
- Why does he scold so badly?
- This is the reason I refused.

1643
01:28:31,141 --> 01:28:32,101
He talks a lot.

1644
01:28:32,459 --> 01:28:35,093
Let's settle this issue
within the cabinet table.

1645
01:28:35,387 --> 01:28:37,133
- Them?
- What is outsider suggesting?

1646
01:28:37,157 --> 01:28:39,791
I'm talking to my king.

1647
01:28:40,125 --> 01:28:41,490
- Chitragupta.
- My lord.

1648
01:28:41,855 --> 01:28:43,855
You talk too much. Get out.

1649
01:28:44,568 --> 01:28:47,282
Listen to me. Get out.

1650
01:28:50,138 --> 01:28:52,402
Is Kumaradasan the problem?

1651
01:28:52,855 --> 01:28:55,061
Or any more problems?

1652
01:28:55,093 --> 01:28:56,807
There are many problems here.

1653
01:28:57,753 --> 01:29:00,118
There are more pending cases here.

1654
01:29:00,333 --> 01:29:03,507
If I don't finish it up in six days

1655
01:29:03,943 --> 01:29:08,123
I would have to face
the music of Lord Shiva

1656
01:29:08,449 --> 01:29:10,890
I can manage other cases.

1657
01:29:11,311 --> 01:29:15,318
But Kumaradasan's case
is bugging me a lot.

1658
01:29:15,681 --> 01:29:18,022
Fate has saved him from my hands.

1659
01:29:19,878 --> 01:29:23,068
- Please give a solution.
- Give us a little time.

1660
01:29:23,163 --> 01:29:24,984
We shall discuss and
provide a good solution.

1661
01:29:25,977 --> 01:29:26,603
Ok.

1662
01:29:40,852 --> 01:29:45,710
Wait. We've discussed
and come to a conclusion.

1663
01:29:46,272 --> 01:29:49,668
We shall share it.
Take what you need and forget the rest.

1664
01:29:50,561 --> 01:29:54,276
I'll definitely use your advise.

1665
01:29:54,529 --> 01:29:56,680
Beloved sir,
you tell him.

1666
01:29:58,281 --> 01:30:02,258
In my opinion, there is only one
reason for all earthly problems.

1667
01:30:02,653 --> 01:30:07,113
Strong people decides
the life of the weak.

1668
01:30:07,534 --> 01:30:10,570
This should change.

1669
01:30:11,174 --> 01:30:15,058
If weaker ones decide the life of
strong, good people live good.

1670
01:30:15,301 --> 01:30:16,856
Numbers of evil people will dwindle.

1671
01:30:17,111 --> 01:30:20,856
Population will decrease.
This is my only conclusion.

1672
01:30:21,948 --> 01:30:25,308
Sir. Please explain.
I just have the basic education

1673
01:30:25,887 --> 01:30:32,366
People who think that they have
authority, wealth, caste etc...

1674
01:30:32,594 --> 01:30:37,247
should be controlled by public.
That will change everything.

1675
01:30:37,411 --> 01:30:38,514
Do you understand?

1676
01:30:40,050 --> 01:30:42,788
This is our solution.
This will definitely succeed.

1677
01:30:43,169 --> 01:30:44,772
I favour non-violence.

1678
01:30:45,683 --> 01:30:47,404
But at the current situation

1679
01:30:47,826 --> 01:30:50,225
Towards our efforts in
building an utopian society

1680
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:52,352
I agree with our
beloved sir's advise

1681
01:30:53,257 --> 01:30:57,495
and the principles of Netaji.

1682
01:31:04,275 --> 01:31:06,275
Thank you so much for your advise.

1683
01:31:07,505 --> 01:31:08,068
Hey Ram.

1684
01:31:08,846 --> 01:31:12,619
- Isn't it actor Kamal's movie?
- Talkativeness is the reason for your sufferings.

1685
01:31:13,153 --> 01:31:14,564
Sorry, sir.
Please...

1686
01:31:40,325 --> 01:31:44,074
My lord.
Your style has changed a lot.

1687
01:31:44,352 --> 01:31:45,654
Great change.

1688
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:49,172
I've listened to the advise
of four best wise men.

1689
01:31:49,267 --> 01:31:51,267
That lead me to a plan.

1690
01:31:51,318 --> 01:31:53,698
If the plan succeeds,

1691
01:31:54,632 --> 01:31:57,529
Earth and Yamalogam will be restored

1692
01:31:58,298 --> 01:31:59,615
What is that plan, my lord?

1693
01:32:01,848 --> 01:32:03,006
One plus one.

1694
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:10,171
One plus one? What does that mean?

1695
01:32:10,314 --> 01:32:12,514
When a person's death is unfair

1696
01:32:12,832 --> 01:32:17,792
if he wishes, he can summon his
slayer and get him sentenced

1697
01:32:18,397 --> 01:32:19,690
Sounds like a very good plan.

1698
01:32:22,321 --> 01:32:25,321
Does this plan help us to kill him?

1699
01:32:25,797 --> 01:32:27,054
Will earth be restored?

1700
01:32:27,285 --> 01:32:30,033
If he kills even one person on earth

1701
01:32:30,613 --> 01:32:33,297
I'll kill him through his victim.

1702
01:32:33,972 --> 01:32:35,483
Not just that, Chitragupta.

1703
01:32:35,611 --> 01:32:37,611
They don't commit
crime individually.

1704
01:32:37,681 --> 01:32:39,078
They do it as a gang.

1705
01:32:39,664 --> 01:32:42,282
If we kill all these culprits

1706
01:32:42,576 --> 01:32:44,473
Earth will be restored back

1707
01:32:45,113 --> 01:32:48,605
Concluding that good people
live and bad guys don't.

1708
01:32:49,905 --> 01:32:53,269
Won't there be confusions
due to this plan, my lord?

1709
01:32:53,294 --> 01:32:55,563
- Yes.
- Won't it lead to anything catastrophic?

1710
01:32:56,862 --> 01:32:58,880
We are already in catastrophic
situation, you idiot.

1711
01:32:59,397 --> 01:33:01,716
This is our last hope.
Let's try it out.

1712
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:04,200
It's good if it succeeds.
Else I don't care.

1713
01:33:04,299 --> 01:33:06,299
- What say?
- Let's do it, my lord.

1714
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:08,567
- Let's do it.
- Sure?

1715
01:33:08,575 --> 01:33:09,027
Let's do it.

1716
01:33:11,321 --> 01:33:12,188
I'm coming.

1717
01:33:34,574 --> 01:33:35,196
My lord.

1718
01:33:35,942 --> 01:33:38,804
You wanted to spread the
one plus one plan on earth.

1719
01:33:39,241 --> 01:33:40,740
Why did you take us here?

1720
01:33:41,018 --> 01:33:42,565
Sathyanadha was my classmate.

1721
01:33:42,725 --> 01:33:44,869
Devotee of Lord Shiva.
Not just that.

1722
01:33:45,044 --> 01:33:48,131
Some things should be spread
through particular people.

1723
01:33:48,210 --> 01:33:50,296
That's why I seek his help. Come.

1724
01:33:50,321 --> 01:33:52,075
- Him?
- Come, my lord.

1725
01:33:52,218 --> 01:33:55,448
- Greetings friend.
- My ashram is cleansed with your visit.

1726
01:33:56,171 --> 01:33:57,186
- Buddy.
- Yes, dude.

1727
01:33:57,211 --> 01:33:59,211
I want to talk to you in private.

1728
01:33:59,433 --> 01:34:00,702
Send them out.

1729
01:34:00,798 --> 01:34:03,524
I have never taken up any
task without their presence.

1730
01:34:03,556 --> 01:34:05,908
You always end in up trouble
when you are left with them.

1731
01:34:05,964 --> 01:34:06,817
Ask them to leave.

1732
01:34:06,993 --> 01:34:09,358
Go. Not so far.

1733
01:34:09,630 --> 01:34:12,026
- I've never been alone.
- Shut up.

1734
01:34:12,312 --> 01:34:13,185
Let them go.

1735
01:34:14,289 --> 01:34:15,423
- Dude.
- Yes, buddy.

1736
01:34:15,439 --> 01:34:18,794
It's so good to meet
you after a long time.

1737
01:34:19,334 --> 01:34:21,082
But I need your help.

1738
01:34:22,816 --> 01:34:23,927
Why is he thrusting his chest?

1739
01:34:24,999 --> 01:34:25,848
Meditation.

1740
01:34:26,932 --> 01:34:30,122
One plus one plan should be spread.
Right?

1741
01:34:30,186 --> 01:34:33,249
- Nice.
- How did you know?

1742
01:34:33,644 --> 01:34:36,271
Not just that.
When you were walking

1743
01:34:36,287 --> 01:34:39,533
I know that you were ogling
at the lady in the middle.

1744
01:34:40,175 --> 01:34:41,929
- What is it?
- That's Sathyanandha.

1745
01:34:42,270 --> 01:34:43,314
Whoever it is.

1746
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:48,290
I scan them first for any
cameras with divine eyes

1747
01:34:48,330 --> 01:34:50,121
- Enough of your tale.
- Not just that.

1748
01:34:50,535 --> 01:34:54,725
I've reached this stature only
after learning all the arts.

1749
01:34:55,201 --> 01:34:56,915
Let the learning be aside.

1750
01:34:57,010 --> 01:34:59,407
Do you practice them correctly?

1751
01:35:01,071 --> 01:35:05,944
I've experimented the
64 arts in 68 positions.

1752
01:35:06,536 --> 01:35:08,210
- Don't you know that?
- I do.

1753
01:35:08,393 --> 01:35:10,240
How can I be of help?

1754
01:35:10,256 --> 01:35:11,597
- Tell me mate.
- Mate...

1755
01:35:12,311 --> 01:35:16,577
You should spread the one plus
one plan to all in this world.

1756
01:35:16,586 --> 01:35:18,784
- Will you do it for me?
- Sure.

1757
01:35:18,917 --> 01:35:21,401
- I'll do as you said.
- Thanks dude.

1758
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:24,797
I need your help likewise.

1759
01:35:24,909 --> 01:35:25,430
What is it?

1760
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:30,739
Don't take my soul if anyone
summons me under one plus one plan.

1761
01:35:33,902 --> 01:35:36,068
If your deeds and devotion

1762
01:35:36,497 --> 01:35:40,021
are useful to the
people, I won't harm you.

1763
01:35:40,675 --> 01:35:42,830
If it ends up harming them,

1764
01:35:43,211 --> 01:35:46,950
I will end your life with your trident.
Clear?

1765
01:35:46,959 --> 01:35:48,959
Ok, my lord.

1766
01:35:49,645 --> 01:35:50,482
I'm leaving.

1767
01:35:56,966 --> 01:35:58,431
Today's breaking news.

1768
01:35:58,645 --> 01:36:03,965
One plus one plan is spreading
fast because of St. Sathyanandha.

1769
01:36:03,997 --> 01:36:06,541
Let's watch a special segment about it.

1770
01:36:07,510 --> 01:36:10,435
One plus one is nothing but

1771
01:36:10,808 --> 01:36:13,990
when a person, for his selfishness

1772
01:36:14,419 --> 01:36:16,740
kills others,

1773
01:36:16,891 --> 01:36:20,986
victim after reaching yamalogam

1774
01:36:21,367 --> 01:36:26,611
shall have the soul of his murderer.
That is one plus one plan.

1775
01:36:26,830 --> 01:36:31,727
This special plan was
introduced by King Yamadharma.

1776
01:36:31,784 --> 01:36:32,566
- Did you see this dude?

1777
01:36:32,678 --> 01:36:34,431
- Who's it?
- That's a rumor.

1778
01:36:34,526 --> 01:36:37,016
What do you think of
Yamadharma's one plus one plan?

1779
01:36:37,064 --> 01:36:40,589
Judgment day has arrived.
God has descended on his white horse.

1780
01:36:40,589 --> 01:36:41,870
None shall escape.

1781
01:36:43,747 --> 01:36:46,136
Lord Yama, if you are real.

1782
01:36:46,327 --> 01:36:49,945
Forgive the neighbor military
who killed our fishermen.

1783
01:36:50,316 --> 01:36:54,856
But please kill the politicians who
play politics with their corpse.

1784
01:36:56,412 --> 01:36:57,943
It would be good if it's true.

1785
01:36:58,110 --> 01:37:01,327
I would take the
bribing cops if I die.

1786
01:37:12,598 --> 01:37:14,816
Sir.

1787
01:37:18,258 --> 01:37:20,305
- Nobody home?
- I'm here.

1788
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:23,306
- Where is he?
- He went to the farm.

1789
01:37:23,453 --> 01:37:24,929
Ok then.
I'll see meet him there.

1790
01:37:25,390 --> 01:37:26,239
You stupid.

1791
01:37:26,819 --> 01:37:29,638
Youngsters long to spend
lonely time with their girlfriends.

1792
01:37:30,162 --> 01:37:33,698
But you wish to leave
like a kid on vacation.

1793
01:37:34,270 --> 01:37:36,795
No. I'm scared.

1794
01:37:38,768 --> 01:37:39,347
Ok. Go.

1795
01:37:52,194 --> 01:37:58,531
Your sight impregnates
my soul for a scrutiny...

1796
01:37:58,929 --> 01:38:00,854
It kindles the desire in me

1797
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:05,308
Your words are rhythmic as anklets...

1798
01:38:05,713 --> 01:38:07,571
Sings a lullaby...

1799
01:38:07,797 --> 01:38:09,984
I'm dumbstruck.

1800
01:38:10,183 --> 01:38:14,231
Like the eternally active wind...

1801
01:38:14,526 --> 01:38:21,181
As an inseparable shadow,
stay along side me.

1802
01:38:21,285 --> 01:38:26,055
I shall fill your life with happiness

1803
01:38:26,055 --> 01:38:32,151
Your sight impregnates
my soul for a scrutiny...

1804
01:38:32,582 --> 01:38:34,430
It kindles the desire in me

1805
01:38:34,826 --> 01:38:38,881
Your words are rhythmic as anklets...

1806
01:38:39,252 --> 01:38:41,133
Sings a lullaby...

1807
01:38:41,547 --> 01:38:43,593
I'm dumbstruck.

1808
01:39:00,374 --> 01:39:03,088
- Why are you serving 8 idlis?
- Really?

1809
01:39:03,113 --> 01:39:05,675
Won't I see if you stack them?

1810
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:07,170
I know no math.

1811
01:39:07,353 --> 01:39:10,956
My son should have
plate full and eat full.

1812
01:39:11,743 --> 01:39:15,398
My mom bore me in her womb...

1813
01:39:15,803 --> 01:39:20,019
Here you are to bore in your heart.

1814
01:39:20,382 --> 01:39:24,314
When you play the drums, my lady...

1815
01:39:24,487 --> 01:39:28,884
We get closer to the Almighty.

1816
01:39:29,416 --> 01:39:33,144
I feel the motherly love in you

1817
01:39:33,491 --> 01:39:37,465
- As it sings the lullaby
- I turned handsome

1818
01:39:37,659 --> 01:39:41,443
Your absence gives
me sleepless nights

1819
01:39:42,167 --> 01:39:45,125
I act weird at your proximity.

1820
01:39:47,370 --> 01:39:51,097
I can't stop admiring you.

1821
01:39:51,531 --> 01:39:54,417
Not sure why

1822
01:39:55,977 --> 01:40:02,349
Your sight impregnates
my soul for a scrutiny...

1823
01:40:02,660 --> 01:40:04,503
It kindles the desire in me

1824
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:08,997
Your words are rhythmic as anklets...

1825
01:40:09,439 --> 01:40:11,288
Sings a lullaby...

1826
01:40:11,557 --> 01:40:13,689
I'm dumbstruck.

1827
01:40:14,003 --> 01:40:16,471
I feel like this is
wrong, Vaishnavi.

1828
01:40:16,496 --> 01:40:18,947
We didn't do anything wrong
yet, driver.

1829
01:40:19,154 --> 01:40:20,566
We wish to get married.

1830
01:40:21,053 --> 01:40:25,116
As an inseparable shadow,
stay along side me.

1831
01:40:25,116 --> 01:40:29,374
I shall fill your life with happiness

1832
01:40:53,552 --> 01:40:54,917
Greetings, sir.
Welcome.

1833
01:40:55,298 --> 01:40:58,338
I've come to get the payback for
loan you got from the bank.

1834
01:41:00,275 --> 01:41:02,155
We have serious water shortage, sir.

1835
01:41:02,519 --> 01:41:03,838
Government failed to help us too.

1836
01:41:04,148 --> 01:41:05,817
I plough trusting the rain.

1837
01:41:06,191 --> 01:41:08,547
Please wait.
I'll pay the loan back soon, sir.

1838
01:41:09,064 --> 01:41:12,179
You won't be able to pay back ever.

1839
01:41:12,298 --> 01:41:13,536
Seize the vehicle.

1840
01:41:14,164 --> 01:41:17,084
Sir, please don't.
I beg you.

1841
01:41:17,346 --> 01:41:18,175
Sir, please spare it

1842
01:41:18,311 --> 01:41:21,096
Sir, this is like God to me.

1843
01:41:21,121 --> 01:41:24,485
- This is my only source of food.
- What happened, uncle?

1844
01:41:24,493 --> 01:41:27,850
- Sir, give me a chance.
- You don't pay but talk of pride.

1845
01:41:28,112 --> 01:41:29,993
Sir, please forgive
us for this month.

1846
01:41:30,303 --> 01:41:32,787
We'll definitely pay it next month.

1847
01:41:32,922 --> 01:41:35,636
Your husband can never pay the loan back.

1848
01:41:36,144 --> 01:41:38,059
Can you satisfy me for a month?

1849
01:41:38,258 --> 01:41:40,655
I'll pay your husband's entire loan.

1850
01:41:43,980 --> 01:41:44,892
Mom, please don't cry.

1851
01:42:09,591 --> 01:42:12,202
My Lord, he's our first customer
under our one plus one plan.

1852
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,297
- What's your name?
- Ramasamy.

1853
01:42:15,559 --> 01:42:17,059
Do you know about this plan?

1854
01:42:17,202 --> 01:42:19,436
This was already proposed to
us by our MP's and M.L.A's.

1855
01:42:19,461 --> 01:42:21,381
We've been already cheated.
Please refer us another plan.

1856
01:42:22,723 --> 01:42:23,953
Another plan?

1857
01:42:24,379 --> 01:42:26,307
Should I order for snacks and tea?

1858
01:42:26,522 --> 01:42:28,997
Please add up for dinner
too, my Lord. It's late.

1859
01:42:29,625 --> 01:42:32,108
Do I look like Yaman
or a street food vendor.

1860
01:42:32,506 --> 01:42:33,592
- Chitragupta.
- My Lord.

1861
01:42:33,617 --> 01:42:36,124
- Take and punish him in the hell.
- Drag him out.

1862
01:42:36,871 --> 01:42:37,378
Go.

1863
01:42:37,847 --> 01:42:40,611
Even I don't get dinner here. Next.

1864
01:42:41,595 --> 01:42:43,147
You look like Bijili Ramesh.

1865
01:42:43,457 --> 01:42:45,457
- How did you die?
- Suicide.

1866
01:42:45,489 --> 01:42:46,449
Good but why?

1867
01:42:46,981 --> 01:42:48,725
Financial problems.
I died due to lack of money.

1868
01:42:48,924 --> 01:42:51,805
No money. You should've
died during demonetization.

1869
01:42:51,900 --> 01:42:53,217
- Isn't it?
- Yes, my Lord.

1870
01:42:53,541 --> 01:42:55,136
Where to send him?

1871
01:42:55,478 --> 01:42:58,243
Let him be here to assist us.
We can use him as a helper.

1872
01:43:01,899 --> 01:43:02,868
Greetings, sir.

1873
01:43:05,286 --> 01:43:07,587
My Lord. He's merely a human.

1874
01:43:07,699 --> 01:43:09,293
Why do you respect him so much?

1875
01:43:09,349 --> 01:43:11,034
He's not a mere human.

1876
01:43:11,082 --> 01:43:12,256
He's a farmer.

1877
01:43:12,483 --> 01:43:16,308
He feeds the souls created by Lord Brammah.

1878
01:43:16,523 --> 01:43:18,699
He's a Demi-God on earth.

1879
01:43:20,039 --> 01:43:22,340
But he's dead as he
couldn't repay the loan.

1880
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:25,722
Farmers are known for such deaths.

1881
01:43:25,866 --> 01:43:31,191
Shall we bring the person
responsible for your death here?

1882
01:43:31,358 --> 01:43:33,358
Oh no. Killing is sin.

1883
01:43:34,871 --> 01:43:36,752
You say so.

1884
01:43:37,046 --> 01:43:38,871
But he was never concerned
about your family.

1885
01:43:39,347 --> 01:43:42,010
They may destroy thousand of
families if we let them live.

1886
01:43:42,066 --> 01:43:46,090
Please decide.
Let him be the first and last one.

1887
01:43:48,695 --> 01:43:49,575
What do you say?

1888
01:43:50,361 --> 01:43:51,943
Kill him, my Lord.

1889
01:43:52,444 --> 01:43:54,229
- Chitragupta.
- Ok, my Lord.

1890
01:43:54,261 --> 01:43:58,634
Under our one plus one plan,
the bank officer is the primary accused.

1891
01:44:04,737 --> 01:44:05,277
Hello.

1892
01:44:06,468 --> 01:44:09,721
You sisters always
interchange your places

1893
01:44:09,996 --> 01:44:11,464
I'm coming there. Hang up.

1894
01:44:11,917 --> 01:44:15,004
My Lord. He's on his way
to his mistress' home.

1895
01:44:15,607 --> 01:44:17,218
Is that so?

1896
01:44:17,551 --> 01:44:19,677
- Ram him with a container truck.
- Ok, my Lord.

1897
01:44:29,954 --> 01:44:31,049
Job done, my Lord.

1898
01:44:31,248 --> 01:44:34,210
Please wait. He'll be here
shortly after his autopsy.

1899
01:44:36,683 --> 01:44:38,199
Did you bring me
here because of him?

1900
01:44:41,808 --> 01:44:44,683
You have raged Him enough.
Better be calm.

1901
01:44:45,119 --> 01:44:47,414
Isn't it a rumor about
one plus one plan?

1902
01:44:47,803 --> 01:44:49,367
You stand witness to it

1903
01:44:49,519 --> 01:44:51,875
What did I do? I did my duty.

1904
01:44:51,899 --> 01:44:53,699
He didn't pay his loan back.

1905
01:44:53,818 --> 01:44:55,048
Is it my mistake to demand it back?

1906
01:44:57,085 --> 01:44:59,782
Ok. How much does he owe you?

1907
01:44:59,926 --> 01:45:00,547
500,000 rupees.

1908
01:45:00,659 --> 01:45:02,659
- How much did he pay you?
- 700,000 rupees.

1909
01:45:03,347 --> 01:45:06,206
Chitragupta.
He had paid 200,000 extra.

1910
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:07,792
He turns to a bigger cheat than you.

1911
01:45:07,817 --> 01:45:09,276
In our Chitragupta descendants

1912
01:45:09,301 --> 01:45:12,720
we've seen a lot of accounts.

1913
01:45:12,745 --> 01:45:14,822
But I couldn't understand the
accounts on this interest rate.

1914
01:45:15,053 --> 01:45:18,144
There of lot of categories
in interest rates on earth.

1915
01:45:18,256 --> 01:45:19,876
I tried to get back legally.

1916
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:21,813
But it's to unjust to being me here.

1917
01:45:23,232 --> 01:45:25,065
Are we unjust?

1918
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:26,726
You are.

1919
01:45:26,909 --> 01:45:29,625
You destroy the nation's
natural resources.

1920
01:45:29,752 --> 01:45:31,255
You pollute the air.

1921
01:45:31,525 --> 01:45:35,008
You trade water with the companies
when there is a demand for it.

1922
01:45:35,159 --> 01:45:36,406
You engage in illegal sand mining.

1923
01:45:36,430 --> 01:45:40,499
And you kill the investigating
officer in public.

1924
01:45:40,631 --> 01:45:43,559
Destroying all the resources
required for farming

1925
01:45:43,766 --> 01:45:48,043
you demand justice that he
didn't pay you the interest.

1926
01:45:48,837 --> 01:45:51,760
Soft spoken words don't yield money.
But insulting them does.

1927
01:45:52,093 --> 01:45:54,093
- This is our bank rules.
- Rules.

1928
01:45:54,712 --> 01:45:55,729
He seems to be legal.

1929
01:45:56,238 --> 01:46:01,007
Why didn't you take legal actions
on the one who looted 100 billion?

1930
01:46:01,016 --> 01:46:03,353
He stays in air conditioned
prison cell.

1931
01:46:03,503 --> 01:46:06,912
Even I, the Yaman stayed in normal
room at Chennai for 10 days.

1932
01:46:07,258 --> 01:46:09,424
How did we manage at
Rayapuram Mansion?

1933
01:46:09,512 --> 01:46:11,385
- Non air conditioned.
- Yes.

1934
01:46:11,541 --> 01:46:14,922
We lit the candles due to power cut.
No water in the bathrooms.

1935
01:46:15,033 --> 01:46:17,033
Whose money are you
spending for your luxury?

1936
01:46:17,172 --> 01:46:18,846
Yamadharma. A small deal.

1937
01:46:19,005 --> 01:46:20,111
- Chitragupta.
- My Lord.

1938
01:46:20,128 --> 01:46:22,128
He wants to deal with me.

1939
01:46:22,239 --> 01:46:24,202
Drag him to hell, daemons.

1940
01:46:26,209 --> 01:46:26,978
Come sir.

1941
01:46:28,097 --> 01:46:30,440
He's not a guest.
Drag him to hell and thrash him up.

1942
01:46:30,534 --> 01:46:32,534
Scramble his face.

1943
01:46:35,097 --> 01:46:37,430
My Lord, shall we send him to heaven?

1944
01:46:37,776 --> 01:46:39,418
- Chitragupta.
- Yes, my Lord.

1945
01:46:39,506 --> 01:46:41,815
He's a God who fed the world.

1946
01:46:42,128 --> 01:46:45,548
Shall we sing to refresh him up?

1947
01:46:45,771 --> 01:46:50,096
Poet Vaali, T.M.S and M.S.V.

1948
01:46:50,327 --> 01:46:51,970
Summon those three.

1949
01:46:54,576 --> 01:47:00,841
Farmer who caters to the
needy world is incomparable

1950
01:47:01,622 --> 01:47:05,123
But to keep him hunger free...

1951
01:47:27,516 --> 01:47:34,889
Farmer who caters to the
needy world is incomparable

1952
01:47:35,431 --> 01:47:42,769
But none on this earth is bothered
to keep him hunger free

1953
01:47:42,946 --> 01:47:47,268
None on this earth...

1954
01:47:47,457 --> 01:47:55,530
The nature too fails
to shower mercy on him

1955
01:47:55,555 --> 01:48:02,667
Politicians feed on the poor
and exploit them to the core.

1956
01:48:02,667 --> 01:48:03,667
Next case..

1957
01:48:09,794 --> 01:48:11,837
Please let me go!

1958
01:48:27,731 --> 01:48:29,111
Praise Lord Aiyappa.

1959
01:48:29,970 --> 01:48:31,287
Done, my Lord.

1960
01:48:32,077 --> 01:48:33,482
You finish it in a jiffy.

1961
01:48:33,744 --> 01:48:35,577
We accept your punishment, my Lord.

1962
01:48:35,744 --> 01:48:38,311
Can women in this world be
safe if we get punished?

1963
01:48:39,161 --> 01:48:41,049
Or is it possible to stop the crimes?

1964
01:48:41,074 --> 01:48:44,541
Do you know why were men
created, you idiot?

1965
01:48:45,839 --> 01:48:48,315
To protect women from wild animals.

1966
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:50,862
A man was created for every woman.

1967
01:48:51,414 --> 01:48:54,915
Wild animals always
stay as animals.

1968
01:48:55,003 --> 01:48:58,602
But you humans are turning wild

1969
01:49:00,622 --> 01:49:01,399
Lady.

1970
01:49:03,016 --> 01:49:06,404
The punishments from my books
won't be sufficient for them.

1971
01:49:06,810 --> 01:49:11,002
You decide their punishment
balancing your sufferings.

1972
01:49:11,422 --> 01:49:12,541
It will be done here.

1973
01:49:14,227 --> 01:49:14,694
My Lord.

1974
01:49:15,576 --> 01:49:19,544
They consider their masculinity and
casteism as pride and bravery.

1975
01:49:20,997 --> 01:49:24,661
Let their genitals
be cut and fed to dogs.

1976
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:29,356
- Feed it to dogs.
- As you wish.

1977
01:49:29,830 --> 01:49:31,155
- Chitragupta.
- My Lord.

1978
01:49:31,330 --> 01:49:35,393
Take the four of them
and with the blade...

1979
01:49:36,616 --> 01:49:37,623
With the blade...?

1980
01:49:38,497 --> 01:49:39,497
Cut it off!

1981
01:49:39,627 --> 01:49:41,840
Daemons. Drag them out.

1982
01:49:41,865 --> 01:49:44,237
Throw them into the pit of misery.

1983
01:49:44,967 --> 01:49:46,022
You go to the heaven.

1984
01:49:47,226 --> 01:49:48,521
Who're these two kids?

1985
01:49:48,585 --> 01:49:51,965
They were killed by
parents for extra biriyani.

1986
01:49:53,045 --> 01:49:54,584
Oh. The Kundrathoor children.
Come here.

1987
01:49:55,362 --> 01:49:57,458
- What are your names?
- Abilashini.

1988
01:49:57,483 --> 01:49:58,419
- And yours?
- Kavin.

1989
01:49:59,094 --> 01:50:00,975
- Which grade are you?
- Second grade.

1990
01:50:01,015 --> 01:50:02,412
- And you?
- First grade.

1991
01:50:02,570 --> 01:50:03,808
I'm fifth grade.

1992
01:50:04,749 --> 01:50:07,235
I'm better educated than you.
How did you come here?

1993
01:50:07,894 --> 01:50:10,762
Someone killed us when
we were asleep, uncle.

1994
01:50:11,191 --> 01:50:13,550
Poor mom, should be looking for us.

1995
01:50:14,082 --> 01:50:15,363
Shall we bring her here?

1996
01:50:16,872 --> 01:50:18,008
Please do it soon.

1997
01:50:19,282 --> 01:50:20,313
When will she be here?

1998
01:50:20,457 --> 01:50:22,051
- Chitragupta.
- My Lord.

1999
01:50:22,076 --> 01:50:23,631
What is she doing?

2000
01:50:23,842 --> 01:50:27,470
I've been waiting since
long time for you, Sundaram.

2001
01:50:27,780 --> 01:50:30,045
I'm buying biriyani for
you, darling.

2002
01:50:30,165 --> 01:50:31,743
Did you buy leg piece?

2003
01:50:31,807 --> 01:50:34,521
I've bought a lot
of it just for you.

2004
01:50:34,585 --> 01:50:36,783
What will you do giving
everything to me?

2005
01:50:37,037 --> 01:50:38,969
I have an alternate plan.

2006
01:50:39,310 --> 01:50:42,929
Stop tempting on phone
and come home soon.

2007
01:50:45,237 --> 01:50:45,983
My Lord.

2008
01:50:46,468 --> 01:50:51,296
She's on tik tok after getting ready
for her next biriyani with Sundaram.

2009
01:50:51,582 --> 01:50:53,582
- On tik tok?
- Yes, my Lord.

2010
01:50:53,741 --> 01:50:55,947
Let her come and dance here.

2011
01:50:56,241 --> 01:50:56,939
Bring her.

2012
01:50:57,487 --> 01:50:59,487
3, 2, 1.

2013
01:51:01,611 --> 01:51:04,532
Sleep alone during our fight.

2014
01:51:04,969 --> 01:51:07,218
Kill me for some time, dear.

2015
01:51:07,401 --> 01:51:09,262
Dear.

2016
01:51:09,429 --> 01:51:12,055
Kill me for some time...

2017
01:51:14,112 --> 01:51:15,127
Done, my Lord.

2018
01:51:17,175 --> 01:51:18,772
- Mom, are you here?
- Mommy.

2019
01:51:20,992 --> 01:51:21,754
Hell with you.

2020
01:51:22,405 --> 01:51:24,619
- Angels...
- No.

2021
01:51:24,897 --> 01:51:29,444
Call Mother Theresa,
who was called as the Mother of the world.

2022
01:51:40,779 --> 01:51:42,541
Come children.

2023
01:51:46,694 --> 01:51:49,305
You've killed your
children for your affair.

2024
01:51:49,583 --> 01:51:51,543
Don't you feel bad for it?

2025
01:51:51,567 --> 01:51:53,781
It's not fried. It's boiled.

2026
01:51:54,765 --> 01:51:57,367
Shut up. Without knowing
that you're the murderer,

2027
01:51:57,471 --> 01:52:01,510
Those poor children came running
and hugged you when they saw you.

2028
01:52:01,587 --> 01:52:04,944
Didn't you feel pity
on seeing their face?

2029
01:52:05,116 --> 01:52:06,774
- Yes. But I remembered Sundaram.
- When?

2030
01:52:06,799 --> 01:52:08,576
I'll thrash that Sundaram.

2031
01:52:09,695 --> 01:52:12,858
Why would a husband suffer
in a foreign country?

2032
01:52:12,978 --> 01:52:14,846
Did he do it to lead a
luxury life for himself?

2033
01:52:14,957 --> 01:52:20,481
No. He suffers for the well being
of his children, wife and family.

2034
01:52:21,014 --> 01:52:24,490
But you have affairs here.

2035
01:52:24,553 --> 01:52:26,442
- Don't you feel ashamed?
- This is women empowerment.

2036
01:52:26,544 --> 01:52:28,956
You shouldn't involve.
Men and women are equal.

2037
01:52:29,048 --> 01:52:31,477
You idiot.
Equality?

2038
01:52:32,056 --> 01:52:34,675
That rule is on earth.
Not here in yamalogam.

2039
01:52:35,776 --> 01:52:39,294
They won't forgive me
if I don't punish you.

2040
01:52:39,429 --> 01:52:40,920
- Shall I?
- Yes, my Lord.

2041
01:52:43,556 --> 01:52:45,556
Don't whine. Take it.

2042
01:52:45,581 --> 01:52:46,738
Ask him not to beat me up.

2043
01:52:46,817 --> 01:52:49,865
- You're looking him already!
- He's beating me up for real.

2044
01:52:50,063 --> 01:52:51,483
- I don't want Sundaram.
- Who else do you want?

2045
01:52:51,492 --> 01:52:52,983
Can you keep me as your lady?

2046
01:52:53,928 --> 01:52:54,912
Hands off you shameless woman.

2047
01:52:55,079 --> 01:52:56,900
My mom's looking for bride. What?

2048
01:52:56,964 --> 01:52:58,416
I've been already punished.

2049
01:52:58,432 --> 01:53:00,678
Bring Sundaram and get us
married under one plus one plan.

2050
01:53:00,686 --> 01:53:01,725
Sundaram again?

2051
01:53:02,265 --> 01:53:03,463
Chitragupta.

2052
01:53:03,488 --> 01:53:04,455
- My Lord.
- Not him.

2053
01:53:04,472 --> 01:53:08,130
Not him? Chitragupta.
She's wishing for another affair.

2054
01:53:08,448 --> 01:53:10,805
Drag her to hell and poke her.

2055
01:53:10,980 --> 01:53:12,500
- Where?
- Wherever you wish for.

2056
01:53:12,906 --> 01:53:14,869
Daemons. Drag her to hell.

2057
01:53:14,885 --> 01:53:16,885
- I want Sundaram.
- Go away.

2058
01:53:16,906 --> 01:53:18,818
She wants Sundaram even after
killing her own children.

2059
01:53:18,834 --> 01:53:21,548
My Lord,
why do you want her to spiked?

2060
01:53:22,025 --> 01:53:25,008
Send her to me. I'll shall...

2061
01:53:26,225 --> 01:53:28,629
Am I Yaman, or a pimp?

2062
01:53:29,018 --> 01:53:31,268
- Hey...are you free?
- Yes, my Lord.

2063
01:53:31,285 --> 01:53:32,610
- Do you know to beat?
- Yes.

2064
01:53:32,635 --> 01:53:33,919
Thrash him up.

2065
01:53:34,756 --> 01:53:37,058
- How did my father manage them?
- You naughty idiot.

2066
01:53:46,597 --> 01:53:47,367
What is it?

2067
01:53:47,645 --> 01:53:50,319
- This was roaming alone when it was a calf.
- Ok.

2068
01:53:50,367 --> 01:53:51,771
I've been raising it
for past 20 years.

2069
01:53:51,954 --> 01:53:54,740
I feed it three times
even though I starved.

2070
01:53:54,772 --> 01:53:57,240
But yet it smashed me to death.

2071
01:53:57,764 --> 01:54:01,200
Isn't it a sin to kill your owner?

2072
01:54:01,685 --> 01:54:04,245
My Lord, I'm a mammoth creature.

2073
01:54:04,403 --> 01:54:06,760
Yes, you're bigger than me. And?

2074
01:54:07,039 --> 01:54:10,156
He made me to beg for
money at temple gates.

2075
01:54:10,276 --> 01:54:11,707
- You idiot. Did you?
- It blessings. Not begging.

2076
01:54:11,716 --> 01:54:15,723
Devotees donate for blessings.
It is lying here.

2077
01:54:15,824 --> 01:54:21,569
You made it beg instead and earn
through it. Don't you feel ashamed?

2078
01:54:21,681 --> 01:54:26,172
He never feeds me with that money.
He drinks and eat for himself.

2079
01:54:26,197 --> 01:54:27,704
You drink and eat
without feeding it?

2080
01:54:27,729 --> 01:54:30,323
My Lord, I don't booze..

2081
01:54:30,405 --> 01:54:32,056
When did animals lie?

2082
01:54:32,081 --> 01:54:37,333
I've bought him rotten bananas,
plantain and coconut leaves.

2083
01:54:37,546 --> 01:54:40,910
Rotten bananas?
Is it an elephant or a dustbin?

2084
01:54:40,942 --> 01:54:42,566
Let him go back to earth.

2085
01:54:42,590 --> 01:54:45,312
Let him beg for alms
until his death.

2086
01:54:45,328 --> 01:54:47,241
Let him eat rotten fruits and die.

2087
01:54:47,432 --> 01:54:51,779
Before that, pluck his both
eyes out. Daemons.

2088
01:54:52,558 --> 01:54:55,168
- Come.
- Throw him down.

2089
01:54:55,419 --> 01:54:56,500
- Go on.
- Gajendra.

2090
01:54:57,342 --> 01:54:58,520
Thiruvannamalai Temple,

2091
01:54:58,822 --> 01:54:59,925
Lord Shiva's temple.

2092
01:55:00,156 --> 01:55:03,100
You go there to replace
elephant Kalyani.

2093
01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:05,588
- You may leave.
- Thank you, my Lord.

2094
01:55:10,828 --> 01:55:13,218
Greetings, Nagarani.
What's the problem?

2095
01:55:13,504 --> 01:55:17,221
This lady prayed and fed Nagarani
with eggs and milk, daily.

2096
01:55:17,593 --> 01:55:20,149
But Nagarani killed the lady.

2097
01:55:21,529 --> 01:55:24,433
Why did you kill those who fed
you, Nagarani?

2098
01:55:24,831 --> 01:55:25,564
What's the reason?

2099
01:55:25,795 --> 01:55:29,422
I lived happily with my 10
babies inside the snake pit.

2100
01:55:29,485 --> 01:55:31,207
- Ok.
- Because she poured milk inside

2101
01:55:31,224 --> 01:55:34,064
all my 10 kids died of suffocation.

2102
01:55:34,915 --> 01:55:36,542
- She poured too much.
- That's forgivable.

2103
01:55:36,558 --> 01:55:40,161
- But her prayers after it...
- What's her request?

2104
01:55:40,383 --> 01:55:41,613
She wants her mother-in-law dead.

2105
01:55:41,637 --> 01:55:44,399
Her sister-in-law to be destroyed.
Neighbor lady to be burnt to death.

2106
01:55:44,424 --> 01:55:47,081
She wants Nayanthara model sarees.
But never let others to live.

2107
01:55:47,142 --> 01:55:49,777
She hates when I get a
new skin after shedding

2108
01:55:50,150 --> 01:55:52,174
That's the reason I killed her.

2109
01:55:52,330 --> 01:55:55,401
You did right. How to punish her?

2110
01:55:59,654 --> 01:56:02,702
Excellent punishment.
Koushik, come here.

2111
01:56:04,429 --> 01:56:05,016
My Lord.

2112
01:56:06,792 --> 01:56:08,101
Drag her here.

2113
01:56:10,148 --> 01:56:13,420
He's your husband henceforth.

2114
01:56:13,596 --> 01:56:15,596
- Him?
- Yes.

2115
01:56:15,900 --> 01:56:19,435
You shall stay as couples forever.

2116
01:56:19,459 --> 01:56:23,613
I've never had even the company of a girl.
Thank you, my Lord.

2117
01:56:24,046 --> 01:56:25,918
- Please no, my Lord.
- Take her away.

2118
01:56:25,942 --> 01:56:26,960
Did I arrange?

2119
01:56:26,969 --> 01:56:28,849
- Shall we start our first night?
- Please no, my Lord.

2120
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:32,520
- Please change the judgment.
- Prompt punishment.

2121
01:56:32,734 --> 01:56:35,195
I don't understand
what you've done now.

2122
01:56:35,220 --> 01:56:37,362
Shut up. You know I behaved like a pimp.

2123
01:56:37,592 --> 01:56:38,346
Don't dig it.

2124
01:57:13,982 --> 01:57:17,124
Reasoning with the government
rules meant to save us

2125
01:57:17,482 --> 01:57:20,314
they killed us like a criminal.

2126
01:57:22,054 --> 01:57:24,736
Government didn't punish them too.

2127
01:57:26,323 --> 01:57:29,690
They killed my child before
it was born, my Lord.

2128
01:57:32,228 --> 01:57:33,974
I didn't get justice there.

2129
01:57:34,085 --> 01:57:36,200
Will I get justice here, at least?

2130
01:57:36,296 --> 01:57:38,296
Yamadharman is bound to justice.

2131
01:57:38,448 --> 01:57:39,657
- Chitragupta.
- My Lord.

2132
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:42,300
- Take him out.
- Yes, my Lord.

2133
01:57:43,682 --> 01:57:47,266
- Greetings, sir.
- Why do you greet so cheap?

2134
01:57:47,393 --> 01:57:48,683
What have you done?

2135
01:57:48,810 --> 01:57:51,603
This couple didn't stop on my
signal, riding without helmet.

2136
01:57:51,739 --> 01:57:52,805
So I did my duty.

2137
01:57:52,821 --> 01:57:59,242
Would've you kicked them if it
was your mother or your sister?

2138
01:57:59,398 --> 01:58:01,518
Why should my family
ride in two wheelers?

2139
01:58:01,727 --> 01:58:03,006
I own a car?

2140
01:58:03,174 --> 01:58:04,794
- You've got a car?
- Yes.

2141
01:58:05,397 --> 01:58:06,945
What's your monthly salary?

2142
01:58:07,064 --> 01:58:10,852
- 57,000 rupees.
- And the car's cost?

2143
01:58:11,074 --> 01:58:12,143
3.5 million rupees.

2144
01:58:12,477 --> 01:58:13,842
How does it tally, Chitragupta?

2145
01:58:13,858 --> 01:58:15,226
Nothing much, my Lord.

2146
01:58:15,250 --> 01:58:19,885
They earn well by stealing
bikes with the help of kids.

2147
01:58:20,424 --> 01:58:22,280
That's how he bought the car.

2148
01:58:22,305 --> 01:58:24,137
Is it so?

2149
01:58:24,145 --> 01:58:27,367
Apart from it,

2150
01:58:27,391 --> 01:58:31,875
he kissed his women colleagues
during night patrol duty.

2151
01:58:32,415 --> 01:58:34,359
Did he kiss them?

2152
01:58:35,272 --> 01:58:38,598
My Lord, he's a liar.
I respect women.

2153
01:58:39,058 --> 01:58:41,233
- I'm under devotional yatra.
- Is it so?

2154
01:58:41,963 --> 01:58:44,235
Do you respect women?

2155
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:45,838
- Yes.
- Won't you ogle at women?

2156
01:58:45,996 --> 01:58:47,172
- Yes.
- Do you swear?

2157
01:58:47,188 --> 01:58:48,727
- I swear.
- Wait a minute.

2158
01:58:48,799 --> 01:58:50,227
Pooja. Stand here for a second.

2159
01:58:52,585 --> 01:58:53,407
Look at him.

2160
01:58:54,947 --> 01:58:56,836
Senthil. You see her too.

2161
01:59:02,271 --> 01:59:02,969
Senthil.

2162
01:59:03,732 --> 01:59:05,426
Why do you peep?

2163
01:59:05,641 --> 01:59:07,641
Look at her directly.

2164
01:59:08,410 --> 01:59:10,796
Look at him.
How is she?

2165
01:59:11,732 --> 01:59:14,054
She's so beautiful.

2166
01:59:14,285 --> 01:59:16,033
So you want her after your yatra.

2167
01:59:17,613 --> 01:59:19,596
Don't be shy.
Say whatever you feel.

2168
01:59:19,613 --> 01:59:21,445
I'm ok if you're fine with it.

2169
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:24,447
- Idiot. Chitragupta.
- My Lord.

2170
01:59:24,472 --> 01:59:25,860
Place him in hell.

2171
01:59:26,106 --> 01:59:27,828
I'll come to finalize
his punishment.

2172
01:59:27,947 --> 01:59:29,285
Tell the punishment.

2173
01:59:29,682 --> 01:59:32,065
Some punishment details can't
be revealed in Yamalogam.

2174
01:59:32,256 --> 01:59:33,322
It may result in
censor board problems.

2175
01:59:33,402 --> 01:59:34,108
Take him away.

2176
01:59:34,132 --> 01:59:36,266
- Come.
- You're abusing a cop.

2177
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:39,159
- Leave me.
- Get in.

2178
01:59:39,968 --> 01:59:45,917
I recommend Lord Brammah for you
to give birth to the same baby.

2179
01:59:46,291 --> 01:59:46,986
Yes, my Lord.

2180
01:59:47,304 --> 01:59:49,156
Until she gives birth to the child

2181
01:59:49,363 --> 01:59:52,687
assist her with four maids.

2182
01:59:52,704 --> 01:59:55,195
- Ok, my Lord.
- Consider this your mother's home.

2183
01:59:55,614 --> 01:59:56,828
Thank you so much, sir.

2184
02:00:09,810 --> 02:00:11,270
Shouldn't you know the person
before you question him?

2185
02:00:11,357 --> 02:00:12,542
Smack you!

2186
02:00:13,565 --> 02:00:14,565
Hey..

2187
02:00:15,142 --> 02:00:16,079
Thiru...

2188
02:00:16,809 --> 02:00:18,350
- Sir...
- Hmm.

2189
02:00:18,794 --> 02:00:21,531
Will you talk anything if
you have a mic in hand?

2190
02:00:22,164 --> 02:00:23,088
What did you ask?

2191
02:00:23,183 --> 02:00:25,738
Sir, Is it true that you have a
mistress in Chennai?

2192
02:00:26,049 --> 02:00:28,340
Yes I maintain mistress, you scoundrel!

2193
02:00:28,342 --> 02:00:30,342
What's your problem with that?

2194
02:00:30,508 --> 02:00:32,103
This is not a mere party office.

2195
02:00:32,207 --> 02:00:35,806
It's a temple we build
over the corpses of other caste guys

2196
02:00:35,838 --> 02:00:39,288
whom we murdered for
speaking against us.

2197
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:45,244
What did you ask? Am I a caste extremist?
Nope. I am not.

2198
02:00:45,577 --> 02:00:49,419
I'm am a maniac! A caste maniac!

2199
02:00:50,657 --> 02:00:53,043
Do you know what
will happen when I go mad?

2200
02:01:06,668 --> 02:01:08,668
Who are they,
resembling Friends movie characters?

2201
02:01:08,890 --> 02:01:12,827
Welcome! So, you were the
ones murdered by Kumaradasan?

2202
02:01:12,906 --> 02:01:13,946
Yes, Sir!

2203
02:01:14,025 --> 02:01:16,303
- What happened? Tell me.
- What should we tell?

2204
02:01:16,359 --> 02:01:18,265
All of you knew him
as a political leader.

2205
02:01:18,485 --> 02:01:22,014
No one knows about his sand mafia,
kidnapping, honor killings and scams.

2206
02:01:22,422 --> 02:01:26,088
When we were about to expose this
to public, you killed us unjustifiably.

2207
02:01:26,136 --> 02:01:30,622
Hey! Am I Yaman or the
writer of a police station?

2208
02:01:30,691 --> 02:01:32,831
- Why are they complaining to me?
- Lord...

2209
02:01:32,986 --> 02:01:35,462
Listen to them patiently,
completely and then decide.

2210
02:01:35,518 --> 02:01:37,518
What should I listen and decide?

2211
02:01:37,543 --> 02:01:41,035
Even if we expose his criminal
side and imprison him,

2212
02:01:41,214 --> 02:01:43,059
He will bail out on the 10th day.

2213
02:01:43,867 --> 02:01:46,298
He can't be punished
while he is on earth.

2214
02:01:46,804 --> 02:01:50,888
But, shall we punish
him here at Yamalogam?

2215
02:01:52,114 --> 02:01:53,517
Kill him

2216
02:01:59,660 --> 02:02:00,975
- Chitragupta?
- Lord!

2217
02:02:01,086 --> 02:02:03,411
- I am unable to find him.
- What are you saying?

2218
02:02:06,236 --> 02:02:08,252
This mustache is pricking.

2219
02:02:09,816 --> 02:02:11,729
He is playing hide and
seek this time too.

2220
02:02:11,759 --> 02:02:12,672
- My lord
- Hmm.

2221
02:02:12,697 --> 02:02:14,356
Try to do something!

2222
02:02:16,051 --> 02:02:18,916
You can't kill him, my lord.

2223
02:02:19,027 --> 02:02:21,027
Who is that?
Come forward.

2224
02:02:22,616 --> 02:02:24,632
Greetings! Yama Guru!

2225
02:02:24,719 --> 02:02:27,037
Welcome,
you arrived at the right time.

2226
02:02:27,149 --> 02:02:31,160
- You can kill him.
- He had killed not one but three lives.

2227
02:02:31,433 --> 02:02:33,072
Why can't I take his life?

2228
02:02:33,092 --> 02:02:33,949
- Lord!
- Hmm.

2229
02:02:34,044 --> 02:02:36,044
You rewrote the fate
written by Brahma.

2230
02:02:36,100 --> 02:02:40,701
Hereafter you can't use your
right to kill against him.

2231
02:02:41,021 --> 02:02:43,845
I asked a way to kill him,
instead he is killing me with his talks.

2232
02:02:44,242 --> 02:02:45,621
Can you explain it clearly?

2233
02:02:45,701 --> 02:02:48,952
Don't you know the universal rules?
Birth and death are decided at once.

2234
02:02:48,979 --> 02:02:50,740
Souls are related to one another.

2235
02:02:50,764 --> 02:02:55,023
For someone to die,
thousands die along with him in chaos,

2236
02:02:55,058 --> 02:03:00,936
For the survival of a butterfly,
millions of species go extinct...

2237
02:03:00,954 --> 02:03:05,565
Why? This is Justice! This is fate!
This is Lord Shiva's rule!

2238
02:03:07,085 --> 02:03:09,656
Okay! Tell me,
who holds control over his fate?

2239
02:03:10,735 --> 02:03:12,839
You forgot the mistake
you've committed.

2240
02:03:12,870 --> 02:03:15,560
- You saved the life of a girl, didn't you?
- Yes!

2241
02:03:15,996 --> 02:03:18,806
The girl is the key to the demon's death.

2242
02:03:20,453 --> 02:03:21,599
What? Chitragupta...

2243
02:03:22,826 --> 02:03:24,644
How can we kill him then?

2244
02:03:24,755 --> 02:03:27,206
You have to kill the girl,
in order to kill the demon.

2245
02:03:30,524 --> 02:03:35,271
I won't sacrifice the
girl's life for killing him!

2246
02:03:35,455 --> 02:03:40,225
The fate of the earth and yamalogam,
is not in the control of you or Lord Shiva.

2247
02:03:40,247 --> 02:03:42,134
The girl holds the fate.

2248
02:03:42,150 --> 02:03:43,680
Rest is up to you.

2249
02:03:43,752 --> 02:03:45,300
You are in command.
I'll see you later!

2250
02:03:45,459 --> 02:03:46,893
Please go away.

2251
02:03:49,126 --> 02:03:53,858
Lord, yamaguru gives the
final advise here at Yamalogam

2252
02:03:54,139 --> 02:03:58,939
If we have to fix this,
we must heed to his advise.

2253
02:04:01,276 --> 02:04:08,983
How can I kill an innocent girl for
the sake of this position and throne?

2254
02:04:09,165 --> 02:04:11,714
I am not a dirty
politician to do that.

2255
02:04:12,044 --> 02:04:13,239
Hey, Chitragupta!

2256
02:04:13,639 --> 02:04:17,385
You are the reason for all this chaos.
Come, take this throne.

2257
02:04:17,489 --> 02:04:19,084
- I'm leaving.
- Lord. Please wait.

2258
02:04:19,108 --> 02:04:22,006
I committed that mistake long ago.
Why do you remind it now?

2259
02:04:22,116 --> 02:04:25,425
Impulsive decisions aren't helpful.
Let us think of something effective.

2260
02:04:26,123 --> 02:04:29,827
I want to be alone.
You may leave.

2261
02:04:34,659 --> 02:04:35,564
You too. Get lost!

2262
02:04:48,913 --> 02:04:50,913
Come. Come.

2263
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:54,034
Why you urged me to come?
Ayya's meeting will be over in 10 mins.

2264
02:04:54,273 --> 02:04:57,197
- Tell fast. I need to go.
- We must leave this place soon.

2265
02:04:57,471 --> 02:05:01,448
Are you crazy? Can you imagine the
consequences if Ayya comes to know this?

2266
02:05:01,479 --> 02:05:05,564
- He knew it already.
- He has learnt about your love affair.

2267
02:05:05,677 --> 02:05:10,988
I'm aware of my father's caste-ism. If you
don't come with me, I'll commit suicide.

2268
02:05:15,211 --> 02:05:17,211
No...

2269
02:05:22,348 --> 02:05:23,601
- Lord!
- Hmm.

2270
02:05:24,268 --> 02:05:29,563
We have only 48 hrs to complete
the orders of Lord Shiva.

2271
02:05:29,831 --> 02:05:33,572
- If we delay further...
- Hmm...

2272
02:05:54,786 --> 02:05:56,786
- Chitragupta!
- Lord!

2273
02:05:59,582 --> 02:06:01,582
We will do our duty!

2274
02:06:03,384 --> 02:06:05,696
- Let us claim the life.
- As you say, my Lord!

2275
02:06:13,966 --> 02:06:15,122
Anbazhagi!

2276
02:06:16,832 --> 02:06:18,102
Anbazhagi!

2277
02:06:19,241 --> 02:06:20,977
- Uncle!
- Come here.

2278
02:06:24,731 --> 02:06:26,265
How are you, Anbazhagi?

2279
02:06:26,908 --> 02:06:31,173
I'm fine uncle.
Why did you abscond then?

2280
02:06:32,684 --> 02:06:36,281
My boss called me.
So I went out of town to meet him.

2281
02:06:36,923 --> 02:06:42,010
No. You are lying.
I am aware that you're the God Yaman.

2282
02:06:42,161 --> 02:06:43,229
Who told you that, dear?

2283
02:06:43,591 --> 02:06:46,024
A sage briefed it to my mother,

2284
02:06:46,388 --> 02:06:49,812
It was God Yama,
who did save the life of you daughter.

2285
02:06:49,896 --> 02:06:53,574
He also told that she need not
worry about my life any more.

2286
02:06:54,256 --> 02:06:59,711
I've a doubt. How should I call you, uncle?
or God Yama?

2287
02:07:01,310 --> 02:07:05,211
- You can call me 'uncle!'
- Thanks uncle.

2288
02:07:05,522 --> 02:07:12,520
- Anbazhagi, can you come with me?
- I'll come with you wherever you ask me to

2289
02:07:12,871 --> 02:07:15,625
When you are with me
why should I be scared?

2290
02:07:15,871 --> 02:07:20,542
Now a days you are the only God I pray.
Do you know that, uncle?

2291
02:07:21,227 --> 02:07:24,526
I'm not a God.
I'm Yaman, came to claim your life!

2292
02:07:25,057 --> 02:07:30,103
It's ok uncle. You've the rights
to take the live you gave me.

2293
02:07:32,508 --> 02:07:36,567
Anbazhagi, are you angry with
me for claiming your soul?

2294
02:07:36,738 --> 02:07:40,248
I know that all your actions
are for a good cause.

2295
02:07:41,018 --> 02:07:45,250
uncle, can I tell you something?

2296
02:07:45,539 --> 02:07:50,164
As I am a little girl,
please kill me without any pain, uncle.

2297
02:07:52,793 --> 02:07:54,793
Please, uncle!

2298
02:07:59,396 --> 02:08:06,995
Anbazhagi, I just played a prank with
you for a while. You can go home now.

2299
02:08:07,241 --> 02:08:10,024
- Okay, uncle.
- Fine. Leave.

2300
02:08:10,688 --> 02:08:13,809
Lord. Why do you spare her life?

2301
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:18,904
Chitragupta! Didn't you listen to her
words? Her words melted my heart.

2302
02:08:19,115 --> 02:08:22,038
I will deal with lord Shiva.
Lets go.

2303
02:08:24,326 --> 02:08:28,263
The demon's can be
killed only by the one

2304
02:08:28,605 --> 02:08:30,225
who's lifetime is not
ended but killed by Ayya

2305
02:08:30,509 --> 02:08:35,215
Lord Siva. I'm unable kill the girl.
You can claim my soul for her.

2306
02:08:35,700 --> 02:08:40,504
You have to save Yamalogam
I've no other option, Lord Siva!

2307
02:08:47,142 --> 02:08:52,781
My Lord! One soul is about to leave which
is not in our Book of life and death.

2308
02:08:55,020 --> 02:08:58,935
With this we can use 1+1
scheme to kill the demon!

2309
02:08:59,375 --> 02:09:02,215
- Is it so?
- Yes. My Lord!

2310
02:09:03,803 --> 02:09:06,427
Lord Siva,
Thank you for your grace.

2311
02:09:22,245 --> 02:09:24,245
Mother!

2312
02:09:24,269 --> 02:09:26,712
Bala! Where are you, son?

2313
02:09:26,942 --> 02:09:31,408
- I'm hearing stories about you.
- Please forgive me, mom.

2314
02:09:32,356 --> 02:09:36,146
Vaishnavi, told she would die without me!
I had no other option.

2315
02:09:36,496 --> 02:09:37,323
Hey! Hey!

2316
02:09:39,906 --> 02:09:46,637
Hey Scumbag! if you don't come
here with my daughter in an hour,

2317
02:09:47,418 --> 02:09:51,578
I'll make your mother parade
*** around the town.

2318
02:09:52,047 --> 02:09:54,419
- Hey!
- What happened?

2319
02:09:55,284 --> 02:09:58,422
You... ***

2320
02:10:10,105 --> 02:10:11,791
- Dear!
- Mom! I'm on the way.

2321
02:10:12,069 --> 02:10:14,897
You need not come.
I will take care of things.

2322
02:10:15,447 --> 02:10:18,990
- You better leave somewhere.
- Mom, I won't leave you alone.

2323
02:10:19,851 --> 02:10:25,195
Are you scared that I'll be shamed
if you don't come?

2324
02:10:25,950 --> 02:10:28,615
If you come here, he will even kill you.

2325
02:10:29,378 --> 02:10:30,921
Kill them both.

2326
02:10:30,946 --> 02:10:34,032
You go somewhere and live happily with her.

2327
02:10:34,463 --> 02:10:39,250
- My blessings will always be with you.
- Mom!

2328
02:11:24,991 --> 04:22:49,498
- Lord!
- Huh?

2329
02:11:24,942 --> 02:11:27,106
Here is the soul,
not mentioned in our book of life and death,

2330
02:11:27,796 --> 02:11:29,666
whose lifetime is not over,
but killed by Ayya.

2331
02:11:30,213 --> 02:11:33,543
We were just waiting for this soul!

2332
02:11:36,737 --> 02:11:38,231
- Chitragupta!
- Lord!

2333
02:11:38,620 --> 02:11:44,000
Your sin is tallied.
But not the lifetime of the mother.

2334
02:11:45,372 --> 02:11:48,329
Mother. Why did you kill yourself?

2335
02:11:48,508 --> 02:11:52,735
My son wished her.
I had no other choice.

2336
02:11:53,650 --> 02:11:59,113
If my son has to live peaceful,
then the man shouldn't be alive there.

2337
02:12:00,387 --> 02:12:03,814
Can we use your 1+1 scheme
to bring the demon here?

2338
02:12:04,066 --> 02:12:08,203
We are awaiting that moment.
Shall we kill him?

2339
02:12:08,238 --> 02:12:10,139
- Please kill him, Lord.
- Chitragupta!

2340
02:12:10,313 --> 02:12:11,925
- At your service!
- Smack that demon to death!

2341
02:12:16,807 --> 02:12:20,393
- Hey... Hey...
- Daddy, please.

2342
02:12:20,831 --> 02:12:24,134
Harm me. But not him, dad.
He is innocent!

2343
02:12:24,238 --> 02:12:27,151
You shameful creature!

2344
02:12:27,722 --> 02:12:29,611
You think I would forgive
you out of daughter love?

2345
02:12:29,754 --> 02:12:33,763
You heartless crook. Is you caste's
bravery lies in laying hands on women?

2346
02:12:33,779 --> 02:12:36,164
My caste is not a drainage
to mingle with any blood!

2347
02:12:36,494 --> 02:12:39,351
Hey Thiru! Give it.

2348
02:12:39,367 --> 02:12:41,082
-Ayya, She's our girl.
- Are you advising me?

2349
02:12:41,384 --> 02:12:43,384
- Please leave me dad!
- Kill her!

2350
02:12:46,009 --> 02:12:49,128
- Leave me dad!
- Lift her up.

2351
02:12:49,159 --> 02:12:53,323
- Dad, please leave me.
- Lift and hold her head up.

2352
02:12:59,547 --> 02:13:04,200
Ayya!, Ayya!!

2353
02:13:19,641 --> 02:13:20,766
There he comes!

2354
02:13:21,539 --> 02:13:22,682
Good Morning! Brother!

2355
02:13:23,046 --> 02:13:25,260
Greetings! My foot!
Stop there!

2356
02:13:27,598 --> 02:13:31,927
Hey lady! If I die,
can you son lead a peaceful life?

2357
02:13:32,210 --> 02:13:35,597
I have millions of followers
They will kill him.

2358
02:13:36,114 --> 02:13:40,369
Hey! what are you discussing there?
Do you think this place is your office?

2359
02:13:40,768 --> 02:13:42,848
Sorry! Sorry!

2360
02:13:42,936 --> 02:13:47,235
This is Yama's Fort!
I'm the one who can voice out. Got it?

2361
02:13:47,460 --> 02:13:48,460
You have already
enraged me enough

2362
02:13:49,226 --> 02:13:51,698
You should not spill a word
unless I order you. Stay quiet!

2363
02:13:51,929 --> 02:13:56,019
So much rage on me?
Brother, my crimes are so petty.

2364
02:13:56,897 --> 02:13:59,046
Why sentence me so hard?

2365
02:13:59,125 --> 02:14:01,550
You're corrupted to the core due to
caste-ism and you belittle you crimes!

2366
02:14:01,922 --> 02:14:05,756
That makes your hefty
crimes look dwarfed.

2367
02:14:06,069 --> 02:14:09,911
You're calling me, Yama,
as a brother, as if I'm a boy!

2368
02:14:10,587 --> 02:14:12,434
Am I looking like you boy next door?

2369
02:14:12,451 --> 02:14:14,878
Brother, you're so innocent.

2370
02:14:16,327 --> 02:14:18,668
Can you name that's
void of discrimination?

2371
02:14:19,595 --> 02:14:25,373
Flowers, fruits,
vegetables differ in breeds

2372
02:14:25,964 --> 02:14:30,623
Skip everything. Even the dogs
that scrap for foods have caste!

2373
02:14:30,623 --> 02:14:36,352
- Bairava!
- Even the trees have different breeds, Brother.

2374
02:14:36,622 --> 02:14:41,507
- How can say no to castes among humans?
- Hey! What's so special about your caste?

2375
02:14:41,535 --> 02:14:44,161
- What are you talking, brother?
- Hmm?!

2376
02:14:46,969 --> 02:14:49,541
- That means?
- People's votes.

2377
02:14:49,856 --> 02:14:52,893
- Majority of people in Tamil
Nadu belongs to my caste - huh?!

2378
02:14:53,151 --> 02:14:56,352
- Do you know another fact? You to
belong to our community!

2379
02:14:56,919 --> 02:14:59,001
What!! Am I your caste?

2380
02:14:59,455 --> 02:15:01,407
Chitragupta! What's he blabbering?

2381
02:15:01,407 --> 02:15:07,500
Lord! He's playing the same trick he played
in earth and diverting you. Be careful!

2382
02:15:07,528 --> 02:15:09,869
Watch, how I am gonna divert him now.

2383
02:15:10,073 --> 02:15:17,494
Hey! As you said flowers,
trees and fruits differ.

2384
02:15:17,523 --> 02:15:23,111
But the differences are created by nature.
Who invented the so called human caste?

2385
02:15:31,415 --> 02:15:35,632
Why should we dig into it?
Some X found it. We are just relishing it!

2386
02:15:35,755 --> 02:15:37,939
What! Enjoying?!!
Aren't you ashamed of it?

2387
02:15:38,364 --> 02:15:40,127
- Shameless!
- Brother...

2388
02:15:40,162 --> 02:15:43,020
- You took it wrong!
- Hmm?

2389
02:15:43,028 --> 02:15:46,445
Am I the only one who ran a
party, committed honor killings

2390
02:15:46,470 --> 02:15:49,774
and acquired disproportionate
assets in the name of caste?

2391
02:15:49,786 --> 02:15:51,905
This is the happening
across the nation.

2392
02:15:53,119 --> 02:15:58,127
Its too bad you single out
me for a collective offense!

2393
02:15:58,625 --> 02:16:01,537
You hold the majority of
shares in the total sins!

2394
02:16:01,752 --> 02:16:03,769
- Wait! Wait! Just a minute!
- He is halting me like a bus.

2395
02:16:06,586 --> 02:16:09,112
I'll accept any punishment.

2396
02:16:09,707 --> 02:16:14,195
But allocate offer as per my
caste's reservation quota.

2397
02:16:14,620 --> 02:16:17,090
- Reservation means?
- Allocation of special privilege.

2398
02:16:17,324 --> 02:16:21,768
You seek reservation here in Yamalogam!

2399
02:16:22,109 --> 02:16:24,322
- Why do you need it?
- For heaven, what else!

2400
02:16:25,019 --> 02:16:26,792
Heaven! Huh?

2401
02:16:27,225 --> 02:16:31,166
- People of my caste belongs to heaven.
- All you need is heaven, right?

2402
02:16:32,257 --> 02:16:37,219
If you repeat what I tell,
I'll send you to the heaven.

2403
02:16:37,564 --> 02:16:39,679
- What?
- My Caste is...

2404
02:16:39,703 --> 02:16:41,473
- My Caste is...
- Down to earth...

2405
02:16:41,497 --> 02:16:43,497
- Caste down! down!
- Stop! Stop!

2406
02:16:43,529 --> 02:16:45,886
- I meant to say your caste be united
- Down! down! Caste Down!

2407
02:16:45,894 --> 02:16:47,211
- Chitragupta!
- Caste Down! Down!

2408
02:16:47,425 --> 02:16:51,316
Shut up! In minutes you turned
Yamalogam into a legislative assembly!

2409
02:16:52,497 --> 02:16:57,286
- What sort of creature he is?
- Lord, he's changing colors faster than chameleon

2410
02:16:57,381 --> 02:17:00,496
He has no morals and principles.
He deserves hell.

2411
02:17:00,667 --> 02:17:02,320
Give him a deserving punishment!

2412
02:17:02,975 --> 02:17:08,429
I sentence him to receive all the
punishments applicable in Yamalogam

2413
02:17:08,554 --> 02:17:12,888
- As you say, lord!
- Marinate him in spices...

2414
02:17:13,107 --> 02:17:16,186
Grind him using a
stone and spike him.

2415
02:17:16,273 --> 02:17:18,543
Take him away.
What are you laughing at?

2416
02:17:18,781 --> 02:17:20,248
- You proved you belong to our caste.
- How come?

2417
02:17:20,416 --> 02:17:23,361
- Without any doubt, you're my caste.
- How can you say that?

2418
02:17:23,520 --> 02:17:27,326
Because only people of our community,
never do a good deed for us.

2419
02:17:27,853 --> 02:17:32,716
I rested all my hope on you.
But you stabbed on my back.

2420
02:17:32,732 --> 02:17:35,763
Long live, brother!
Thanks. Bye.

2421
02:17:37,269 --> 02:17:37,851
- Lord...
- Hmm.

2422
02:17:38,240 --> 02:17:41,922
What if you belong to
his caste as he claims?

2423
02:17:42,025 --> 02:17:43,904
I will hit you with the mace!

2424
02:17:44,517 --> 02:17:46,995
- Hey, you belong to our caste. Isn't it?
- Come in, I'll let you know.

2425
02:17:48,248 --> 02:17:51,470
All beings are equal in my perspective!

2426
02:17:51,984 --> 02:17:55,190
- Lord, what about that Lady?
- Oh, I forgot.

2427
02:17:55,960 --> 02:18:02,363
Lady, I thank you for sacrificing
you life to save me and my Yamalogam.

2428
02:18:05,427 --> 02:18:07,427
- Chitragupta.
- Yes. Lord!

2429
02:18:07,443 --> 02:18:10,258
- Angels! Please take her along.
- Hmm. Hmm.

2430
02:18:10,720 --> 02:18:14,346
Take her along!

2431
02:18:14,552 --> 02:18:16,552
I can smell tiger's skin.

2432
02:18:16,853 --> 02:18:18,695
Here he comes! Lord Siva!

2433
02:18:21,226 --> 02:18:24,060
Thanks uncle,
I can smell you from miles.

2434
02:18:24,354 --> 02:18:27,148
- Mother is coming.
- Look at the time she arrives.

2435
02:18:27,171 --> 02:18:28,770
When did you arrive my lord?

2436
02:18:28,925 --> 02:18:33,298
- Thanks a lot, Lord Siva.
- Why is your mother unusually sobbing today?

2437
02:18:33,392 --> 02:18:37,043
She can't booze hereafter as
my dad returned. That's why!

2438
02:18:37,163 --> 02:18:40,049
- Shut your mouth, son!
- Better you do it, before dad smells booze

2439
02:18:40,163 --> 02:18:42,670
What a horrific family!

2440
02:18:42,901 --> 02:18:45,024
- Welcome, uncle Siva.
- I bless you to get married soon.

2441
02:18:45,180 --> 02:18:46,846
My mom is not seeking
suitable bride for me!

2442
02:18:47,036 --> 02:18:50,005
I've to find a girl for me.
Please be seated. Be careful.

2443
02:18:50,028 --> 02:18:52,028
What are you staring at? Remove it!

2444
02:18:52,386 --> 02:18:56,311
Your son rules better than you.

2445
02:18:56,474 --> 02:18:58,711
- You proved you are my blood.
- No, not all.

2446
02:18:58,781 --> 02:19:00,276
Look how he escapes!

2447
02:19:00,415 --> 02:19:03,045
Yama, I'm seeing you
since you were a child.

2448
02:19:03,263 --> 02:19:07,158
You cemented a place in our
hearts with your wise ruling.

2449
02:19:07,446 --> 02:19:09,550
Is your heart a town bus,
to confirm a seat with towel?

2450
02:19:09,566 --> 02:19:17,868
I like your obedience!
I bless you to rule Yamalogam forever!

2451
02:19:18,006 --> 02:19:19,903
- Thank you, uncle!
- Don't mention.

2452
02:19:19,919 --> 02:19:21,641
- Thanks Lord Siva.
- Uncle Siva

2453
02:19:21,641 --> 02:19:23,937
- I've a small request.
- Tell me, Son.

2454
02:19:23,993 --> 02:19:27,230
I want to send 4 people
from here to the Earth.

2455
02:19:27,342 --> 02:19:34,187
Hey! Are you Yaman or junior artist agent.
Always nagging me for devouring people.

2456
02:19:34,414 --> 02:19:35,731
- I'll explain, uncle.
- Tell.

2457
02:19:35,755 --> 02:19:40,836
You are happy with my seven
days' rule here, aren't you?

2458
02:19:40,993 --> 02:19:41,524
A little.

2459
02:19:41,605 --> 02:19:45,367
If we resend the 4 to
earth, they'll rule wisely.

2460
02:19:45,390 --> 02:19:49,039
People will also begin to live in harmony.
That's why I insist, uncle.

2461
02:19:49,063 --> 02:19:51,975
Oh! I see!
Who are the four persons?

2462
02:19:53,315 --> 02:20:00,364
The four people are Ambedkar, Periyar,
Gandhi and Netaji Subash Chandra Bose.

2463
02:20:00,587 --> 02:20:04,109
Awesome selection. But, are you aware
of the present government there?

2464
02:20:04,328 --> 02:20:05,620
Can the four tackle them?

2465
02:20:05,764 --> 02:20:08,423
They'll be in trouble if
the four go there now!

2466
02:20:08,554 --> 02:20:11,859
The four will chase away
those who cheat people.

2467
02:20:11,883 --> 02:20:14,555
- That's why I insist you to send them.
- He makes me to think deep.

2468
02:20:14,571 --> 02:20:17,346
Don't think too deep,
you will lose hairs and become bald again.

2469
02:20:17,714 --> 02:20:22,234
- I'll send the four to earth, as you wish.
- Hmm.

2470
02:20:44,777 --> 02:20:46,684
Enough, we can end it here.

2471
02:20:47,757 --> 02:20:49,392
- Hmm... Lord Siva!
- Seems he won't finish!

2472
02:20:49,392 --> 02:20:51,444
You have to save this world.

2473
02:20:52,673 --> 02:20:57,426
Just like your bald head and smile
the world should shine forever.

2474
02:20:57,451 --> 02:20:59,911
Bless our people with you pleasant voice!

2475
02:20:59,926 --> 02:21:02,557
Long live as long as
Tamizh language thrives.

2476
02:21:03,168 --> 02:21:06,313
We will meet again in Dharmaprabhu Part 2.
Thank you, all.

2477
02:21:10,778 --> 02:21:17,352
Today's headlines. Periyar began his nation
wide campaign against castes and religions.

2478
02:21:17,754 --> 02:21:21,144
A new law on women and
common people protection,

2479
02:21:21,169 --> 02:21:23,826
will be passed tomorrow
by Dr.Ambedkar.

2480
02:21:24,030 --> 02:21:27,538
Netaji Subash Chandra Bose
is all set to strengthen

2481
02:21:27,563 --> 02:21:31,076
the Indian border with
his new INA forces.

2482
02:21:31,573 --> 02:21:35,769
As usual, Gandhiji began his
Satyagraha at Nehru stadium.
