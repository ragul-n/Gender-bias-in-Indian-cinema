1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
23.976

2
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:57,223
"Mom... where are you, mom?"

3
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:49,693
Tell me something.
 How much do you love me?

4
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:53,780
So much!

5
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:59,703
"Do you love your mom more, or me?"

6
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:04,791
You... you are always with me.

7
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,795
Look there.

8
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,715
"Liked the girl's voice?
 - Yes, it was good."

9
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:15,301
Better than mine?
 - Of course not better than yours.

10
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:29,733
I'm going.
 I'll be late in the evening.

11
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,901
For you.

12
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:36,239
This wasn't necessary.
 - Keep it.

13
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,325
Bye dear.

14
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:57,260
"To run the house, I don't
 care whether it is day or night."

15
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,263
And you are taunting me?

16
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:03,266
"Don't belittle me more, please!"

17
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:07,354
Time has already belittled me.

18
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:14,277
"Please Anwar, stop drinking. If your
 business didn't run, it's no big deal."

19
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:18,865
You can still do a lot.

20
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:23,286
"If you like, even you can do a lot."

21
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:27,290
You can at least save this house.

22
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,877
"Come on, hurry up."

23
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:38,885
I will be late coming back. Take
 care of yourself and your sister.

24
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,891
When will you return?

25
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:14,337
"Sorry, I could not come.
 I was not keeping well."

26
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,924
Rukhsana did come.

27
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,845
She hasn't returned home yet.

28
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:25,557
Was someone with her at the party?

29
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:28,601
Who?

30
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:42,949
"Tazo, Daisy, go to your room,
 and take Nazo too."

31
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:49,456
"And listen, look after her always.
 Always!"

32
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,426
Stories are strange.

33
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,429
That is why the incident of
 that day was left unfinished.

34
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:50,934
"The revolver disappeared. Neither
 Rukhsana, nor the police knew..."

35
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:55,021
where the revolver disappeared.

36
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:02,445
Rukhsana Jamal
 was arrested for murder.

37
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:07,951
"Thousands of questions were asked,
 but she didn't answer any."

38
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:15,959
"She had contacts with ministers,
 top lawyers, and industrialists."

39
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,049
"On appeal, Rukhsana Jamal
 was released on bail."

40
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,555
Just a minute.

41
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:46,072
"Murderess, give me a pose too."

42
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,825
Move.

43
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:53,496
"Due to lack of evidence,
 the court acquitted Rukhsana Jamal."

44
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,498
Public memory is short.

45
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:59,836
People forgot Anwar's murder.

46
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,505
Rukhsana Jamal returned to the
 recording studios.

47
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:07,010
"Result? A new private album,
 Tanhai (Loneliness)."

48
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:12,515
And Rukhsana Jamal once again
 became popular in the world of fame.

49
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,518
Only one person remembers
 Anwar's death still.

50
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:21,107
And that's Anwar and
 Rukhsana Jamal's daughter...

51
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,708
And this was our first meeting.

52
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:05,749
I accept... I accept... I accept.

53
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:11,838
I accept... I accept... I accept.

54
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:02,806
Why this black dot?
 - It saves one from evil eyes.

55
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:06,309
I've already been eyed.
 - By whom?

56
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,396
You.

57
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:25,912
What are you doing?

58
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:32,836
"I am a writer. I sometimes write
 in English, and sometimes in Urdu."

59
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,050
Now this beautiful relationship...

60
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:44,848
"is 5 years, 6 months, 12 days,
 3 hours & 6 seconds old."

61
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:13,960
We greet 'Good morning' to
 each other with the hope...

62
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,881
that today's day turns
 out to be special.

63
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,883
Does it really...

64
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:24,387
Salim! You dropped ink
 on my table again!

65
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,891
Why do you use pens like an
 old fashioned accountant?

66
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,893
Why don't you use the computer?

67
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,895
"You won't understand, love."

68
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:35,899
The joy one gets on framing
 words with your hands...

69
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,902
cannot come on a lifeless computer.

70
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:42,405
Don't tell me you are going to write
 another third rate romantic novel.

71
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:46,409
What is that...?
 ' Bilkis Bano's fever'.

72
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,912
'Shahnaz's wallowing sighs'

73
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:53,917
"The fever has subsided,
 and the sighs have stopped."

74
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:57,921
"The title of my new novel is...
 Are you listening, love?"

75
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:01,007
"Yes, Salim."

76
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:07,597
"Yes love, I am writing your story."

77
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:10,433
Not at all! There is nothing worth
 writing about in my story.

78
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,936
Leave that to me.

79
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:19,442
"If the carpet of time is removed, one
 can see many a story hidden like dust."

80
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:24,531
Please stop talking in
 that novelistic language.

81
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:29,953
"Tehzeeb, we even
 have a cat in the house."

82
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:32,956
I don't think the
 fish will live long.

83
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:37,961
Those who die young are happier.

84
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:44,467
How much butter you eat!
 And you know I don't like such things.

85
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,469
Then why do you
 insist on annoying me?

86
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,972
Why are you getting annoyed?

87
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:53,560
"It's such a pleasant day,
 even the weather is good."

88
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,564
Even the mood is good.

89
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:02,485
Romantic indeed!
 And who will serve breakfast to Nazo?

90
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:06,990
I'll serve it to her.
 - Not at all! She's my responsibility.

91
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,785
Why do you keep getting annoyed?
 - Why do you keep annoying me?

92
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,997
"All right, give me a smile.
 - Why?"

93
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:18,501
Because the crooked line of a smile
 reaches the heart straight!

94
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:28,094
She smiled!

95
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,122
What impudence is this!

96
00:15:56,122 --> 00:16:00,377
"If you do this again,
 I'll send you to prison!"

97
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:04,339
Do you want to go to hospital?

98
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:11,054
Don't behave like that.
 Now have breakfast like a good girl.

99
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:14,140
"All right, don't have milk."

100
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:25,068
Is it necessary to drink everyday?

101
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:29,572
"Yes, but one must not drink."

102
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:33,159
"'Your eyes are no less intoxicating,
 but..."'

103
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,078
But what?

104
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:41,084
"' Even your eyes ask for liquor,
 even bars drink"'

105
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:49,092
O great! You really do
 mess up a good couplet!

106
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:54,597
"Thank your stars I am not a poet,
 or what would become of you?"

107
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:58,893
The same that's happening
 reading your cheap novels.

108
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,104
Those times are gone.

109
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:05,108
You know whose story
 I am writing these days.

110
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:08,111
I know. Me and my mom's story.

111
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:12,115
Oh God! Mom's programme...
 I'm too much!

112
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:15,118
Mom's programme?
 - Yes love.

113
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:19,622
"'The honour of music,
 the desire of fans..."'

114
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,125
' is going to come face to face'

115
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:26,129
"You have no right to
 make fun of my mom, Mr. Salim."

116
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:31,134
"Sorry love, I had forgotten;
 only you have that right."

117
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:35,638
She's come!
 Rukhsana... meow!

118
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:43,480
Hello! Greetings to millions
 of fans of Rukhsana Jamal.

119
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:49,486
Life is changing fast;
 and so is our music.

120
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:54,157
"It's the world of rap,
 pop, rock, and remix."

121
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:59,662
Old melodies are being remixed with
 new music and new tunes are created.

122
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:04,959
You will see a glimpse of this
 new music in my new album...

123
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,671
' Pyaar Beshumar'.

124
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:13,176
"Tonight, I am presenting
 one song from this new album."

125
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:18,181
For the new fans of new music!

126
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:21,267
Here goes!

127
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:27,273
"Admirer"

128
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:35,281
"My admirer!"

129
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:02,809
"O my admirer!"

130
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:08,732
"Why are you annoyed?"

131
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:12,235
"Why are you suspicious?"

132
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:17,323
"O my admirer!"

133
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:52,275
"Now that we have met,
 forget all differences"

134
00:19:55,278 --> 00:20:00,283
"I have accepted my mistake"

135
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:07,791
"I always loved you,
 but didn't tell you so"

136
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:21,304
"I had silenced my lips"

137
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:28,395
"O my admirer!"

138
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:12,856
"I thought you will understand me"

139
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:19,362
"I thought you will recognize me"

140
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:27,454
"There was love even in my anger"

141
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:34,461
"Though the word meant refusal,
 it expressed consent"

142
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:39,716
"My style..."

143
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:43,887
"My style you were always aware of"

144
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:48,391
"Unsaid, unheard,
 yet why is it a story?"

145
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:53,980
"O my admirer!"

146
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:27,430
Come.
 - Where?

147
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:32,435
"Come, I'll share all
 my thoughts with you"

148
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:38,525
"I'll express my feelings to you"

149
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:47,450
"If you are with me,
 I have no sorrow in the world"

150
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:52,539
"Even if I cease to exist,
 at least you are there"

151
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:56,459
"In my next step
 in the path of time"

152
00:22:56,459 --> 00:23:01,965
"You will find me
 wherever you go"

153
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:07,053
"O my admirer!"

154
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:53,099
"You were great today, madam.
 It was a great performance!"

155
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:58,521
What is your name?
 - Palak.

156
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,523
Here you are.

157
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:05,028
What a lovely child!
 Bless you.

158
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:16,539
"Mr. Bali, for a minute I felt it was
 my little Tehzeeb standing before me."

159
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:21,127
My daughter was so cute.

160
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:50,156
"Hi Tehzeeb, how are you, dear?"

161
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:57,580
How are you?
 How come you thought of us today?

162
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:02,085
"How can you say that, love? Can
 a mother ever forget her children?"

163
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:07,590
You are my life!
 - We were watching your show.

164
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:12,095
It is great.
 - Really? Thank you.

165
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:17,600
But singing is no more a joy.
 It's only for survival.

166
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:23,106
I called to tell you
 I am coming for a visit.

167
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:27,610
You are coming to our house!!

168
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,613
What's so surprising?

169
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:35,702
Even my children have
 a right to my time.

170
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:41,624
"No mom, it's just... that I
 cannot believe it."

171
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:45,128
"After so many years...
 - Enough, please! Don't taunt me now."

172
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:47,630
You know my reasons.

173
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:52,635
When are you coming?
 - Tomorrow.

174
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:59,142
I have to go. I've been
 invited to Mr. Amar's party.

175
00:26:00,852 --> 00:26:05,648
Wait for me.
 Good night.

176
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:08,735
Good night.

177
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:15,742
Who was it?

178
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:35,261
"I don't ever want to lose you, Nazo."

179
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:41,184
"You are my darling, only mine!"

180
00:26:41,184 --> 00:26:44,771
Nobody else's.

181
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:04,708
She didn't bother
 for so many years.

182
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:09,212
"And all of a sudden,
 her affection is overflowing!"

183
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:15,719
"You know Salim, I sometimes
 feel mom is made of air."

184
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:18,722
You never know where she'll turn.

185
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:24,728
She is not happy with our marriage.
 But I don't understand why.

186
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:29,733
"I look good enough,
 I even have ancestral money."

187
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:35,321
"Apart from smoking and drinking,
 I don't have any kinky habits."

188
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:42,746
We married against her wishes.
 - But with her daughter's consent.

189
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:48,752
Doesn't she want you
 to have a loving husband?

190
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:54,257
I don't even know now
 whether you love me or not.

191
00:27:55,091 --> 00:28:00,096
"Love!! Sweetie, since when
 did your tongue become acid?"

192
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:07,771
I'll give you proof now!
 Surrender yourself to me!

193
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:24,788
"What happened, Umrao? You didn't
 like my humming, or my applying dye?"

194
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:30,377
"Old is gold, understand?"

195
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:35,799
My heart sometimes does
 miss my children.

196
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:40,804
I have no complains
 against my daughter.

197
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:45,392
But Salim ruined her.

198
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:50,397
Wonder how much she has changed.

199
00:28:52,315 --> 00:28:56,820
You have done a great
 favour in visiting your dear ones.

200
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:02,826
Damn! This sounds like
 cheap school level play.

201
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:20,427
I sound like an old English lady.

202
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:23,847
'Your arrival has
 brought along spring'

203
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:29,853
"' Mom, it seems your arrival
 has made our desert bloom'."

204
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:36,359
"Tehzeeb, my darling!
 Have you forgotten your mom?"

205
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:41,865
It will be obvious I'm acting.

206
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:44,367
So...

207
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:48,872
Madam Rukhsana loves to be praised.

208
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:58,381
You look just the same!
 Just as beautiful and young!

209
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:03,303
"What magic potion
 do you possess, mom?"

210
00:30:03,678 --> 00:30:06,264
"Come to think of it,
 why say anything?"

211
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:10,894
"I'll just go,
 open my arms, and that's it!"

212
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:11,936
"Good night, Umrao."

213
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:14,898
"I feel jealous of you.
 You will enjoy here..."

214
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:19,402
and I will have to smile
 and trouble my jaws at the party.

215
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:23,907
Can't help it. One has to pay
 the price of being a public figure.

216
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:32,916
"Stop your nonsense, Tehzeeb. Why do
 you have to say or do any of this?"

217
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:41,424
Does one have to do all
 this to meet one's mother?

218
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:47,013
The eyes reveal what the heart feels.

219
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:07,951
"If you want to talk, come and
 talk to me. Why tire the mirror?"

220
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:11,454
I'm washing my face.

221
00:31:11,454 --> 00:31:15,041
Your tears have
 already washed your face.

222
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,046
"Yes, my love?"

223
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:44,487
"Do you know, mom is going to
 come today. Get dressed quickly!"

224
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:50,994
"Nazo, why this spread-out?
 Mom will come any minute."

225
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:53,496
What are you doing!

226
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:56,499
What's shameful?
 - A bird's nest.

227
00:31:56,499 --> 00:32:02,005
Mom won't like it.
 - Bad hair day today!

228
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:08,511
I'm fine the way I am;
 whether anyone likes it or not.

229
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:29,115
Quite a grand bungalow.

230
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:33,036
Have you ever heard of him?
 - No madam.

231
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:38,124
I have only heard your name.
 I just bought your new album.

232
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:49,052
"Tehzeeb, your hair is the same
 even after so many years."

233
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:54,641
Use a brush in your hair sometimes.

234
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:58,061
Looks like the crow took offense.

235
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:01,648
"Damn that!
 Give me a hug, love!"

236
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:06,653
My darling!

237
00:33:09,072 --> 00:33:13,451
You have pulled down. Doesn't
 Salim give you enough to eat?

238
00:33:13,576 --> 00:33:16,579
"No, I'm dieting these days."

239
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:21,084
Diet? I should be dieting.
 But my fans say...

240
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:25,088
'We love you the way you are!
 Don't reduce your weight'

241
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:29,592
I have to listen to those
 I am living for.

242
00:33:29,592 --> 00:33:31,302
Don't you have any servants?

243
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:35,098
Salim had to suddenly
 leave for the city...

244
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:40,103
"I asked about the servants,
 not Salim."

245
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:44,315
They are on leave today;
 I'll take your bags in.

246
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:50,613
"I am stronger than you. I'll
 carry the bags, you bring Umrao."

247
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:26,733
You didn't tell me even she is here.

248
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:32,739
I was thinking of visiting
 her in the hospital.

249
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:37,160
"Call it hospital, or prison?"

250
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:41,664
I and Salim released this
 prisoner five months ago.

251
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:47,170
"What nonsense are you talking!
 She was not in jail, but in hospital."

252
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:50,674
"That too, in India's
 best private hospital."

253
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:56,179
"Away from dear ones, even hospital
 is worst than the Loneliness of jail."

254
00:34:56,179 --> 00:35:01,768
"Nazo, look what mom
 has brought for you."

255
00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:06,272
A white cat!

256
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:10,568
"And anyway, the doctors have said,
 more than medicines..."

257
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:15,699
"Nazo needs her dear ones.
 Specially, her mother."

258
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:20,286
But you didn't even care to look
 her up in the last five months.

259
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:25,208
"All right, if not her mother,
 her sister."

260
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:30,005
You have taken her responsibility;
 why are you rubbing it in?

261
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:34,217
Do you know anything?
 I don't have time even to breathe.

262
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:38,722
I was on a tour of
 Europe for three months.

263
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:41,808
But Bali was not dead;
 you could have told him.

264
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:44,227
He would have informed me.

265
00:35:44,227 --> 00:35:48,815
"Had I informed you,
 you would get upset."

266
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:55,822
And that makes your
 blood pressure rise.

267
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:04,247
"All right, it's good what you did."

268
00:36:04,247 --> 00:36:11,254
My darling! My bird has flown
 from paradise to meet her mom!

269
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:33,777
"Nazo, my love,
 mom is tired."

270
00:36:34,277 --> 00:36:38,323
Mom is tired.
 - You must be enjoying this game.

271
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:42,786
"The one who has never played,
 what fun can she derive from playing?"

272
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:48,792
We will play; we will play everyday.

273
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:51,961
"Yes, my love.
 - Mom, you will play with me?"

274
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:56,883
"Yes love,
 mom has come to play with you."

275
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,303
My love.

276
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:04,307
What is this?
 My darling is crying.

277
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:07,977
Don't cry; it's a happy occasion.
 - Yes.

278
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:13,817
"Here, I drink your tears.
 - We will play."

279
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:25,328
"Mom, everything
 is the way you like it."

280
00:37:25,328 --> 00:37:28,331
"Three soft pillows,
 two small, and two big towels."

281
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:30,375
Hot water with honey for drinking.

282
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:34,337
And your favourite rose flavored
 soap in the bathroom.

283
00:37:34,337 --> 00:37:38,842
Thank you love;
 but why these balloons?

284
00:37:39,342 --> 00:37:43,847
There are other ways
 to remind me of my age.

285
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:49,436
"Mom, you sure can hurt people."

286
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:56,860
Come here.
 Look what I have brought for you.

287
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:00,447
It's very pretty.

288
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:10,373
Come here. See how beautiful
 it will look on your delicate neck.

289
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:18,381
And for Nazo?
 - Nazo...

290
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:24,387
How was I to know even she will be
 here? We'll buy something for her too.

291
00:38:24,387 --> 00:38:26,389
This is for you.

292
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:29,601
"No mom, Nazo will feel hurt."

293
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:35,899
"Give this to her. And anyway,
 I don't like gold jewelry."

294
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:44,491
You sure can hurt people.

295
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:50,830
"Mom, bathe quickly.
 It gets dark earlier here."

296
00:38:50,914 --> 00:38:55,085
Is Salim coming to dinner or not?

297
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:57,420
"Of course, he must be on his way."

298
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,924
I didn't know you were
 so desperate to meet him.

299
00:39:00,924 --> 00:39:06,930
Why not? Let me see if my daughter's
 husband has changed or not.

300
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:11,518
I'll get dressed and come.

301
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,971
Even the tap is like Tehzeeb.
 You never know when it will burst!

302
00:40:01,484 --> 00:40:05,488
I cannot come
 for the champagne munch.

303
00:40:05,488 --> 00:40:09,075
I have to meet some writer

304
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,025
Come. I didn't expect you to come.
 - Why?

305
00:40:43,526 --> 00:40:48,531
A brand new director of a publishing
 house comes to meet a writer...?

306
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:53,119
It's something great.

307
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:59,042
"Ohio or New York, Malabar Hill
 or Manhattan, makes no difference."

308
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:05,048
"The people, the traffic,
 pollution, everything is the same."

309
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:14,641
I have read your novels.
 They are quite spicy.

310
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:22,565
Yet your publishing house is
 not ready to publish my new novel.

311
00:41:22,565 --> 00:41:27,070
"That's a policy matter, Mr. Salim.
 - Only Salim will do, Ms. Sheena."

312
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:31,658
"Only Sheena will do, Salim."

313
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:39,666
I'd ordered it beforehand.

314
00:41:41,584 --> 00:41:46,089
"Look Salim, there is a market
 for your romantic writing."

315
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:51,594
"Your love stories are quite popular
 in North India, Indonesia & Middle East"

316
00:41:52,095 --> 00:41:55,598
"Now you are writing a serious novel,
 for which there are few readers."

317
00:41:55,598 --> 00:41:59,811
It's a business risk for us.
 Why don't you write a love story?

318
00:42:00,103 --> 00:42:04,107
Because love is not life.
 I mean...

319
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:09,612
Love is only a part of life. And
 I... want to write the story of life.

320
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:14,617
"Sorry, life is not
 valued in our country."

321
00:42:14,617 --> 00:42:19,205
There are very few who value life.

322
00:42:21,624 --> 00:42:25,128
"All right, then some other publishing
 house will publish my novel."

323
00:42:25,128 --> 00:42:28,131
You are annoyed.
 - Of course.

324
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:32,969
"But not with you,
 with your publishing house."

325
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:37,223
I like your honesty.

326
00:42:39,642 --> 00:42:43,855
It's quite late.
 I'll take your leave.

327
00:42:43,855 --> 00:42:47,650
"If you don't mind,
 I'll pay the bill."

328
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:50,737
I don't mind.

329
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:12,175
My darling Tehzeeb has fought with
 her mother and is sitting outside.

330
00:43:15,178 --> 00:43:18,765
I'll pacify her.

331
00:43:30,694 --> 00:43:33,697
I know you are angry with me.

332
00:43:33,697 --> 00:43:37,367
"Rukhsana Jamal, the terror, has come
 to our house for the first time..."

333
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:40,704
and your Salim is so late.

334
00:43:40,704 --> 00:43:46,209
"Don't say a word!"

335
00:43:48,712 --> 00:43:52,716
What is the matter?
 You seem quite healthy today.

336
00:43:52,716 --> 00:43:57,220
You seem to be in a nice mood.

337
00:43:58,221 --> 00:44:03,309
Surrender your ears to me!

338
00:44:05,228 --> 00:44:09,816
Brazen... uncivilized... uncouth!

339
00:44:19,743 --> 00:44:21,745
I could have fainted.

340
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:24,414
It was because of that shawl;
 not my fault.

341
00:44:24,414 --> 00:44:29,252
But an educated man has
 some standards even for humor.

342
00:44:29,252 --> 00:44:33,757
"Sorry Madam Rukhsana, for
 not meeting your expectations."

343
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:52,275
Yes... yes... who's calling?

344
00:44:52,275 --> 00:44:54,778
Hold on... call for you.

345
00:44:54,778 --> 00:44:57,822
"Must be my secretary, Bali.
 - No, it's some Suresh Kumar."

346
00:44:57,822 --> 00:45:00,825
He reached here too!
 - Who is he?

347
00:45:00,825 --> 00:45:05,288
"Some journalist. He cannot write for
 Adams, & says he'll write my biography."

348
00:45:06,122 --> 00:45:10,293
Say I'm dead.
 - She is dead.

349
00:45:10,293 --> 00:45:15,298
"I mean, she has left;
 not this world, but this room."

350
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:22,389
"She cannot come on the line,
 because she is in the bathroom."

351
00:45:22,806 --> 00:45:28,311
Strange man! Is it a crime to
 bathe at night? It's her wish!

352
00:45:28,311 --> 00:45:31,815
"Saw what a stickler he is?
 Next time he calls, say I'm not in."

353
00:45:31,815 --> 00:45:35,819
"I've gone out, I bathing, anything!
 - Even I want to bathe."

354
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:39,406
"Not now, in the morning.
 - And I'll glow."

355
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:41,408
Yes!

356
00:45:41,408 --> 00:45:44,828
"Mom, shall I serve you
 some more Biryani?"

357
00:45:44,828 --> 00:45:49,332
Liked it?
 - It's yum. You cook well.

358
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:54,337
But what's great about that?
 All women do that.

359
00:45:54,337 --> 00:45:58,842
I would appreciate if you had
 concentrated on your singing career.

360
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:03,179
Then the world would know
 Rukhsana Jamal has a daughter too!

361
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:07,934
Even I am your daughter!
 Even I am your daughter.

362
00:46:08,351 --> 00:46:13,356
"Yes, even you are my daughter.
 You are my fairy."

363
00:46:13,857 --> 00:46:16,860
I am a fairy!

364
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:20,864
Mom gave it to me. Isn't it lovely?
 - It's very lovely.

365
00:46:20,864 --> 00:46:23,867
"Next time,
 I'll bring one for Tehzeeb too."

366
00:46:23,867 --> 00:46:28,371
You will come
 again... I don't think so.

367
00:46:28,371 --> 00:46:32,876
Don't taunt me.
 Man has some compulsions too.

368
00:46:33,376 --> 00:46:37,881
"My wife makes excellent coffee.
 More milk, less coffee."

369
00:46:40,884 --> 00:46:45,972
I'm ready to take the risk.
 - Let's take the risk!

370
00:46:53,396 --> 00:46:56,983
"Is Tehzeeb happy, Salim?"

371
00:46:57,901 --> 00:47:01,488
I think she is.

372
00:47:03,907 --> 00:47:08,912
I had very colourful
 dreams for Tehzeeb...

373
00:47:09,913 --> 00:47:11,915
in which there was
 only applause for her.

374
00:47:11,915 --> 00:47:16,419
I know you wanted Tehzeeb
 to be a singer like you.

375
00:47:17,921 --> 00:47:21,925
"Yes, because she is talented."

376
00:47:21,925 --> 00:47:27,013
But you didn't let my
 dreams be fulfilled.

377
00:47:33,436 --> 00:47:40,944
"Don't take offense, but Tehzeeb's
 dreams are more important to me."

378
00:47:41,945 --> 00:47:44,948
Even I wanted Tehzeeb to sing.

379
00:47:44,948 --> 00:47:49,953
But she is happy in her small world.

380
00:47:49,953 --> 00:47:53,957
And in her happiness lies mine.

381
00:47:53,957 --> 00:47:56,459
"Wow! You made yourself the
 sacrificial lamb..."

382
00:47:56,459 --> 00:47:59,963
and benefited from it too.

383
00:47:59,963 --> 00:48:04,968
"Moreover, you got an educated
 girl to do the house chores for free."

384
00:48:04,968 --> 00:48:09,472
"If you really loved her,
 you'd encourage her talent."

385
00:48:11,975 --> 00:48:15,979
Who loves Tehzeeb more...

386
00:48:15,979 --> 00:48:20,483
it is better to leave
 that decision to Tehzeeb.

387
00:48:20,483 --> 00:48:22,652
"Sister no!
 - Nazo, stubborn girl!"

388
00:48:22,652 --> 00:48:25,989
She ran and came here.
 She is not ready to sleep.

389
00:48:25,989 --> 00:48:28,491
Let her be.

390
00:48:28,491 --> 00:48:33,997
"Tell me, does your sister
 sing, or has she quit singing?"

391
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:38,001
She sings.
 She sings melodious lullabies for me.

392
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:42,213
Sing that song
 which I had taught you.

393
00:48:42,213 --> 00:48:47,218
I have forgotten
 everything you taught me.

394
00:48:47,218 --> 00:48:52,515
"Impossible! The way I have taught you,
 you cannot forget even if you want to."

395
00:48:52,682 --> 00:48:54,517
Please sing!

396
00:48:54,517 --> 00:48:58,104
"No mom.
 - Sister, sing."

397
00:49:03,526 --> 00:49:06,613
Please sing!

398
00:49:25,548 --> 00:49:33,056
"You would have no complains..."

399
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:40,146
"or grievances against me"

400
00:49:50,073 --> 00:49:54,661
You sing.

401
00:49:59,582 --> 00:50:03,086
A song is not just
 made by music and melody.

402
00:50:03,086 --> 00:50:09,592
"Feel it,
 only then will the words have soul."

403
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:28,111
"You would have no complains..."

404
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:33,616
"or grievances against me"

405
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:41,124
"If you had..."

406
00:50:43,626 --> 00:50:51,134
"understood my compulsions"

407
00:50:55,138 --> 00:51:00,226
"Just understood them"

408
00:51:25,168 --> 00:51:30,674
"You would have no complains..."

409
00:51:31,174 --> 00:51:36,262
"or grievances against me"

410
00:51:46,189 --> 00:51:52,195
"If you had..."

411
00:51:56,199 --> 00:52:06,209
"If you had
 understood my compulsions"

412
00:52:45,248 --> 00:52:51,755
"Even the painful memories give pain;
 it was better..."

413
00:52:59,763 --> 00:53:08,772
"if I had not
 kept a count of my wounds"

414
00:53:10,273 --> 00:53:16,780
"If you had
 understood my compulsion"

415
00:53:40,303 --> 00:53:46,810
"All our dreams have come true"

416
00:53:54,317 --> 00:54:00,824
"Just think how it would be..."

417
00:54:01,324 --> 00:54:05,120
"if this was true"

418
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:14,337
"If you had
 understood my compulsion"

419
00:55:18,401 --> 00:55:22,405
She is sleeping in comfort.

420
00:55:22,405 --> 00:55:27,994
This noise won't let me sleep!

421
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:51,434
"What are you doing here?
 - Don't leave us and go, mom."

422
00:55:51,434 --> 00:55:56,940
Please don't leave us and go.
 - Where am I leaving you?

423
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:03,029
"I am not going,
 but go to your room now."

424
00:56:07,951 --> 00:56:14,457
Mom will leave us and go again.
 She doesn't love us.

425
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:17,127
She doesn't even let me
 sleep besides her.

426
00:56:17,127 --> 00:56:20,797
"Don't say that, Nazo.
 She is not going anywhere."

427
00:56:20,797 --> 00:56:23,508
No one is going anywhere.
 Your sister is here.

428
00:56:23,508 --> 00:56:30,473
Your brother-in-law is here. I am
 right here. Even your doll is with you.

429
00:56:30,557 --> 00:56:36,062
Don't cry so much. Stop crying.

430
00:56:36,479 --> 00:56:38,982
We are all here.

431
00:56:38,982 --> 00:56:41,484
Cat... cat... silly cat.

432
00:56:41,484 --> 00:56:45,989
Why didn't you come yesterday?
 - My husband fights with me everyday.

433
00:56:46,489 --> 00:56:50,493
"I am the only bread earner,
 my husband doesn't do anything."

434
00:56:50,493 --> 00:56:53,538
He's useless!
 - What's useless?

435
00:56:53,538 --> 00:56:59,002
He's mad!
 - Like me?

436
00:57:00,003 --> 00:57:04,507
"No my dear, you are very intelligent."

437
00:57:05,508 --> 00:57:10,513
Mom has come.
 - She should have come long ago.

438
00:57:11,514 --> 00:57:13,516
Long ago.

439
00:57:13,516 --> 00:57:19,856
"Maid, my doll is my friend, Blackie
 is my friend, Umrao is my friend."

440
00:57:20,023 --> 00:57:24,110
Who is mom's friend?

441
00:57:26,529 --> 00:57:31,117
Play.
 - No one answers me.

442
00:57:31,534 --> 00:57:34,579
The market is two kilometers away.
 Will you manage?

443
00:57:34,579 --> 00:57:38,041
Of course!
 Do you take me to be old?

444
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:41,044
Even I will come along.
 - Where?

445
00:57:41,044 --> 00:57:43,046
We will bring chocolates
 and ice-creams for you.

446
00:57:43,046 --> 00:57:44,589
I don't want chocolates and
 ice-creams; even I will come along.

447
00:57:44,589 --> 00:57:49,052
Nazo listens only to her mom.

448
00:57:49,052 --> 00:57:55,058
"We will go flying like an aeroplane,
 and be back in two minutes!"

449
00:57:55,141 --> 00:58:00,063
"Will you take me in an aeroplane?
 - Yes, why not?"

450
00:58:00,146 --> 00:58:05,068
Promise?
 - This is a promise by Rukhsana Jamal!

451
00:58:05,568 --> 00:58:10,657
We'll be back soon. Bye dear!

452
00:58:15,578 --> 00:58:20,083
Aren't you Ms. Rukhsana?
 ...I am your greatest fan.

453
00:58:21,084 --> 00:58:25,171
I recognized you immediately.

454
00:58:26,589 --> 00:58:30,093
What is your name?
 - Vishwas.

455
00:58:30,093 --> 00:58:35,390
"Give me four autographs; three for my
 children, and one for my wife..."

456
00:58:35,598 --> 00:58:38,935
or I'll have a problem at home.

457
00:58:38,935 --> 00:58:42,605
Even I sing well.

458
00:58:42,605 --> 00:58:47,610
"When our colony organizes
 some function, I only have to sing."

459
00:58:47,652 --> 00:58:52,198
That's great. Take.

460
00:58:52,615 --> 00:58:56,703
I loved meeting you.

461
00:58:59,622 --> 00:59:03,960
"Mom, this Vishwas leaves his
 cycle here everyday."

462
00:59:04,127 --> 00:59:08,131
And I secretly read a few postcards.
 - That's a crime!

463
00:59:08,131 --> 00:59:14,220
But a very interesting one.
 Come!

464
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:20,727
Sit here.

465
00:59:21,644 --> 00:59:26,149
"Respected father, I am fine.
 I pray for your well-being."

466
00:59:26,441 --> 00:59:31,654
I have selected a house here.
 If you could send me Rs.10000...

467
00:59:31,696 --> 00:59:35,158
That's why he thought of his father.
 The greedy fellow!

468
00:59:35,158 --> 00:59:39,162
"Dear Asha,
 I hope you and the kids are fine."

469
00:59:39,162 --> 00:59:42,248
I miss you very much.
 It is very cold here in Delhi.

470
00:59:42,248 --> 00:59:47,003
"Bogus! If he misses them so much,
 why doesn't he call them over?"

471
00:59:47,003 --> 00:59:49,673
This one seems interesting.
 Hear this.

472
00:59:49,673 --> 00:59:53,677
"My dear Anuradha, I want to
 get to know you better."

473
00:59:53,677 --> 00:59:56,721
I want to be lost in
 your wild tresses.

474
00:59:56,721 --> 00:59:59,683
How cheap! How can anyone
 write such crap on a postcard?

475
00:59:59,683 --> 01:00:02,686
The poor guy must not
 be having money for an envelope.

476
01:00:02,686 --> 01:00:05,188
How else could he have
 expressed his feelings?

477
01:00:05,188 --> 01:00:08,191
Don't you feel
 ashamed to do such things?

478
01:00:08,191 --> 01:00:11,903
"I used to feel a little,
 in my childhood."

479
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:13,697
You used to read my letters too?

480
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:18,201
Yes. I used to open
 the envelope with steam.

481
01:00:19,703 --> 01:00:25,583
"But don't worry,
 your secrets are my secrets."

482
01:00:26,209 --> 01:00:31,715
I don't have any secrets.
 - I know that.

483
01:00:31,715 --> 01:00:36,219
"Why do you say things
 that hurt, Tehzeeb?"

484
01:00:36,219 --> 01:00:40,932
Have you ever given a thought to
 how much father must have been hurt?

485
01:00:40,932 --> 01:00:46,312
You are accusing me?
 - I'm not accusing you.

486
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:49,733
Then what do you want to say?

487
01:00:49,733 --> 01:00:53,737
"Neither have I said anything,
 nor do I want to say anything."

488
01:00:53,737 --> 01:00:58,241
But perhaps what I didn't say
 hurt you.

489
01:00:58,241 --> 01:01:02,328
What did you say?
 I didn't hear.

490
01:01:02,746 --> 01:01:06,541
One must hear
 silences too sometimes.

491
01:01:06,541 --> 01:01:09,627
Shall we leave?

492
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:26,936
"Mr. Suresh? She is in the bathroom.
 Yes, she is bathing still."

493
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:32,776
She's bathing?
 - Yes.

494
01:01:32,776 --> 01:01:35,779
She bathing.

495
01:01:35,779 --> 01:01:40,784
"She is bathing... yes, we bathe
 24 hours a day in this house."

496
01:01:45,789 --> 01:01:50,794
"Sheena, you!
 No... I thought it was someone else."

497
01:01:52,128 --> 01:01:55,799
But how come you
 thought of me early morning?

498
01:01:55,799 --> 01:01:58,009
I saw you in my dream.

499
01:01:58,009 --> 01:01:59,803
My thought is more
 fortunate than me.

500
01:01:59,803 --> 01:02:03,807
"It managed to reach your dreams.
 - Flirting, eh?"

501
01:02:03,807 --> 01:02:07,811
I am trying.
 But I know I don't stand a chance.

502
01:02:07,811 --> 01:02:11,481
You will be paid less.
 - I don't understand.

503
01:02:11,481 --> 01:02:16,611
"Eagle Publishers have
 decided to publish your book..."

504
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:19,322
but we'll pay less royalties.

505
01:02:19,322 --> 01:02:24,160
"Really? Thanks, Sheena.
 - Thanks? That's all?"

506
01:02:24,327 --> 01:02:29,416
Won't I get a treat?
 - You will!

507
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:32,419
"Then come over,
 the cheque is ready."

508
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:34,963
I'll leave by the 11 O'clock
 train and reach at three.

509
01:02:34,963 --> 01:02:36,881
Why don't you buy a car?

510
01:02:36,881 --> 01:02:39,843
Because I am an environmentalist
 and hate pollution.

511
01:02:39,843 --> 01:02:41,886
That is why I
 stay amidst mountains...

512
01:02:41,886 --> 01:02:44,889
and don't keep anything that
 emits poisonous smoke.

513
01:02:44,889 --> 01:02:50,353
And what about your smoking habit?

514
01:02:50,353 --> 01:02:53,440
That...

515
01:02:58,361 --> 01:03:02,949
A big goodbye from me too.

516
01:03:04,868 --> 01:03:08,872
"Even I'll come along.
 - No Nazo, I'm going to office."

517
01:03:08,872 --> 01:03:11,875
Even I'll go to office.
 - Kids don't go to office.

518
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:13,918
They do.
 - They don't.

519
01:03:13,918 --> 01:03:18,882
They do... they do... they do...!

520
01:03:21,885 --> 01:03:25,889
"Oh my God!
 - Suman, clean it up fast."

521
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:29,476
Or you've had it!

522
01:03:48,411 --> 01:03:50,580
Here's the cucumber.
 - How much?

523
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:52,415
Rs.160.
 - What?

524
01:03:52,415 --> 01:03:56,920
Rs.160.
 - I didn't ask the cost of your cart.

525
01:03:57,921 --> 01:04:01,966
"Here, take Rs.80."

526
01:04:01,966 --> 01:04:06,262
I have to bring the vegetables from
 the city. The fares have risen.

527
01:04:06,429 --> 01:04:11,726
The fares have really risen.
 - I know you very well.

528
01:04:11,935 --> 01:04:13,978
I haven't come across a bigger
 lair than you in the whole bazaar.

529
01:04:13,978 --> 01:04:18,274
"Stop it! If anyone recognizes me,
 what will become of my image?"

530
01:04:18,274 --> 01:04:22,445
You only care for your image!
 You are too much.

531
01:04:23,446 --> 01:04:27,158
What are you doing!
 - Madam is very generous!

532
01:04:27,158 --> 01:04:29,953
I'll give you a discount of Rs.10;
 only for you.

533
01:04:29,953 --> 01:04:33,748
Keep your Rs.10!
 Why are you spoiling her habits?

534
01:04:33,748 --> 01:04:35,959
"You will go away,
 and I will have to suffer after that."

535
01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:40,964
Do you like fighting for
 pennies like that?

536
01:04:40,964 --> 01:04:45,969
I spend as per my capacity.
 I am not rich like you.

537
01:04:45,969 --> 01:04:49,556
Keep your money!

538
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:53,476
The sun is burning hot.

539
01:04:53,476 --> 01:04:55,020
"If you have finished shopping,
 shall we go home?"

540
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:58,106
Yes.

541
01:05:03,987 --> 01:05:09,075
What are you doing?

542
01:05:18,001 --> 01:05:26,009
"Nazo, what happened?
 Listen to me... listen!"

543
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:29,012
"Listen to me, love."

544
01:05:29,012 --> 01:05:31,056
She is getting those
 maddening fits again.

545
01:05:31,056 --> 01:05:34,017
Don't call Nazo mad;
 she is not mad!

546
01:05:34,017 --> 01:05:40,023
"I am not mad!
 - No Nazo, you are not mad."

547
01:05:40,023 --> 01:05:43,026
Send her to the hospital.
 She is not fit to live here.

548
01:05:43,026 --> 01:05:48,031
She won't go to hospital.
 She will never go to hospital!

549
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:54,037
My baby!
 What happened to my love?

550
01:05:54,037 --> 01:05:56,039
Everyone left me and went away.

551
01:05:56,039 --> 01:05:59,709
"You left, brother-in-law left,
 mom also left."

552
01:05:59,709 --> 01:06:05,048
We didn't go anywhere.
 Nazo's sister is with Nazo.

553
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:11,137
"My darling, my doll."

554
01:06:12,055 --> 01:06:15,642
Where did Salim go?

555
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:19,145
Take.

556
01:06:22,065 --> 01:06:26,111
"I told you, I'm environment friendly.
 I drink only fresh juice, not tinned."

557
01:06:26,111 --> 01:06:31,574
My heart liked what your eyes
 said on our last meeting.

558
01:06:33,076 --> 01:06:37,414
"What did my eyes say?
 - They said..."

559
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:45,588
"'Trust me, one true story is
 better than a hundred fabricated ones"'

560
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:52,595
Thank you for understanding
 my eyes gestures.

561
01:07:00,103 --> 01:07:03,690
Your novel is
 based on your private life.

562
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:08,695
And Rukhsana Jamal
 is a part of your life.

563
01:07:09,612 --> 01:07:14,117
"Frankly, we want to
 cash in on her."

564
01:07:14,117 --> 01:07:17,162
"Your publishing house needs me,
 and I need your publishing house."

565
01:07:17,162 --> 01:07:21,624
Who will go looking
 for a new publisher now?

566
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:25,712
Where do I sign?

567
01:07:26,796 --> 01:07:32,135
It is very rare that the
 heart is as beautiful as the face.

568
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:38,641
You are flirting.
 - I am loving you.

569
01:07:38,641 --> 01:07:43,146
You are kicking me
 and say you are loving me!

570
01:07:43,146 --> 01:07:48,151
"Your wife is very lucky.
 - No, it's me who is lucky."

571
01:07:48,193 --> 01:07:52,155
"Women, girls, ladies,
 whatever you call them..."

572
01:07:52,155 --> 01:07:57,243
I see my wife in all of them.

573
01:07:59,537 --> 01:08:04,250
No... no... no!

574
01:08:12,509 --> 01:08:17,055
"No woman, no!"

575
01:08:31,194 --> 01:08:37,283
"The eyes are enchanting"

576
01:08:41,204 --> 01:08:43,206
"The eyes are enchanting"

577
01:08:43,206 --> 01:08:46,209
"The complexion fair"

578
01:08:46,209 --> 01:08:48,712
"Long tresses"

579
01:08:48,712 --> 01:08:52,799
"And an innocent face"

580
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:22,245
"A surreptitious glance"

581
01:09:22,245 --> 01:09:24,748
"Crooked eyebrows"

582
01:09:24,748 --> 01:09:26,750
"Downcast eyes"

583
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:30,837
"A little love blooming in the heart"

584
01:09:48,271 --> 01:09:54,361
"The heart suffers sudden..."

585
01:09:58,281 --> 01:10:00,784
"The heart suffers sudden
 pangs of fear"'

586
01:10:00,784 --> 01:10:04,871
"It feel coy"

587
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:13,380
"I've just fallen in love"

588
01:10:15,298 --> 01:10:17,342
"And there is a slow obsession"

589
01:10:17,342 --> 01:10:21,388
"The eyes are enchanting..."

590
01:11:10,353 --> 01:11:14,941
"Call it the art of beauty"

591
01:11:19,863 --> 01:11:22,365
"To hide flaws, or..."

592
01:11:22,365 --> 01:11:26,870
"in fake words,
 there is humiliation"

593
01:11:29,372 --> 01:11:35,462
"How can the heart
 not be overwhelmed..."

594
01:11:38,882 --> 01:11:41,718
"by these couplets"

595
01:11:41,718 --> 01:11:45,889
"Are they true words,
 or a complete woman?"

596
01:11:48,892 --> 01:11:52,979
"No woman, no!"

597
01:11:58,401 --> 01:12:02,489
"The eyes are enchanting..."

598
01:12:48,243 --> 01:12:51,955
You are a great dancer!

599
01:12:51,955 --> 01:12:54,457
'So what if I danced'

600
01:12:54,457 --> 01:12:56,793
' I didn't commit any crime'

601
01:12:56,793 --> 01:12:57,919
"We have loved, not stolen...
 - What are you doing...?"

602
01:12:57,919 --> 01:13:02,215
Let me go!
 Leave me alone!

603
01:13:03,508 --> 01:13:06,928
Until Rukhsana Jamal
 had come to my house...

604
01:13:06,928 --> 01:13:09,848
there was so much
 of silence here

605
01:13:09,848 --> 01:13:13,476
Till the late moments in the night...
 a beautiful silence

606
01:13:13,476 --> 01:13:17,564
Silence till the Sun had begun
 to spread its golden rays

607
01:13:17,564 --> 01:13:19,232
And now...?

608
01:13:19,232 --> 01:13:22,527
Now I feel as if I were sitting
 on a volcano

609
01:13:22,527 --> 01:13:28,158
"Simmering lava, hidden under the
 rocks, waiting to explode any moment"

610
01:13:40,503 --> 01:13:43,590
Sis...

611
01:13:44,716 --> 01:13:49,637
what happened?
 - Nothing

612
01:13:52,057 --> 01:13:55,518
Are you angry?
 - No

613
01:13:55,518 --> 01:14:00,523
But I've done nothing.
 - No one has done anything...

614
01:14:01,524 --> 01:14:04,652
and yet everything
 has happened

615
01:14:04,652 --> 01:14:08,907
Today's the 15th of February.
 And no one remembers a thing!

616
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:15,330
Remember what...?
 - That which I can never forget

617
01:14:25,006 --> 01:14:28,009
But those who must remember...

618
01:14:28,009 --> 01:14:32,097
have forgotten everything

619
01:14:35,016 --> 01:14:38,103
Sis!

620
01:14:39,562 --> 01:14:45,235
My darling!
 - My sister!

621
01:14:46,611 --> 01:14:51,741
That's the snake-bite!
 You lost! I won!

622
01:14:51,741 --> 01:14:54,661
The snake bit you
 and I've won!

623
01:14:54,661 --> 01:14:58,623
You've become a champion. If this
 game was played at the Olympics...

624
01:14:58,623 --> 01:15:02,585
Nazo would surely have won
 a gold medal. What say?

625
01:15:02,585 --> 01:15:06,172
Your turn

626
01:15:07,048 --> 01:15:11,594
How're you eating...?
 You make so much of noise

627
01:15:11,594 --> 01:15:15,181
"Close your mouth when you chew.
 - My mouth is closed, Mother"

628
01:15:15,181 --> 01:15:19,602
Who can ever open his mouth
 in your presence?

629
01:15:19,602 --> 01:15:23,606
Hey! What hell has broken loose
 if I correct you a bit?

630
01:15:23,606 --> 01:15:28,862
"A bit...? Ever since you've arrived,
 you've only been correcting me"

631
01:15:29,529 --> 01:15:32,991
"My hair, my singing,
 the way I cook..."

632
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:36,619
you find faults with
 everything I do

633
01:15:36,619 --> 01:15:39,539
"If I do chide you,
 it's for your own good"

634
01:15:39,539 --> 01:15:43,960
"My good? And my good lies in dancing
 to your tunes, isn't it?"

635
01:15:44,961 --> 01:15:48,631
Do you ever realize
 what I want?

636
01:15:48,631 --> 01:15:51,301
"You forget, Mama
 I'm your daughter..."

637
01:15:51,301 --> 01:15:52,969
not your sidekick.
 - Watch your manners!

638
01:15:52,969 --> 01:15:57,307
Did you teach me any manners?
 Did you ever have the time?

639
01:15:57,307 --> 01:16:01,644
Those who blame others for their
 own weaknesses are illiterates

640
01:16:01,644 --> 01:16:05,106
"If I'm an illiterate, you are
 the one responsible for it"

641
01:16:05,106 --> 01:16:07,859
You hadn't the time from
 your piano and mirror...

642
01:16:07,859 --> 01:16:09,986
to ever take a look at
 your children's books!

643
01:16:09,986 --> 01:16:13,198
Is that the way to talk to your mother?
 - I wish I could talk to you...

644
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:17,994
the way one ought to speak
 to a mother like you!

645
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:21,998
Enough! I will not
 tolerate it anymore

646
01:16:21,998 --> 01:16:24,668
So what are you going to do?
 What...?

647
01:16:24,668 --> 01:16:28,380
"You will go away...?
 - No, I'm not going away so easily"

648
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:32,008
"Before I leave, I will find out
 just what's on your mind"

649
01:16:32,008 --> 01:16:33,718
"Enough, let's go out"

650
01:16:33,718 --> 01:16:37,764
"Tehzeeb, I've never interfered
 with what you do"

651
01:16:37,764 --> 01:16:40,392
Get a hold on yourself

652
01:16:40,392 --> 01:16:44,729
"All this isn't right.
 - Let her speak, Salim"

653
01:16:44,729 --> 01:16:49,109
Let me at least hear
 what's in her heart!

654
01:16:51,069 --> 01:16:52,779
Let the lights remain

655
01:16:52,779 --> 01:16:57,784
I want to see just how much hatred
 you harbor for me in your heart

656
01:16:58,410 --> 01:17:01,246
"You're getting me wrong, Mama"

657
01:17:01,246 --> 01:17:05,917
I have no hatred for you.
 I have sympathy

658
01:17:05,917 --> 01:17:08,712
Because you could become
 whatever you wanted to...

659
01:17:08,712 --> 01:17:12,716
but you could never be what
 a woman first becomes

660
01:17:12,716 --> 01:17:16,720
"A daughter, a wife..."

661
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:19,764
and a mother

662
01:17:19,764 --> 01:17:23,768
"If I'm not your mother,
 who gave birth to you?"

663
01:17:23,768 --> 01:17:28,273
Who brought you up...?
 Who fed you her milk?

664
01:17:28,273 --> 01:17:30,525
How would you know what it takes
 to be a mother?

665
01:17:30,525 --> 01:17:33,820
You'll know when you have
 your own children...

666
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:36,406
how a woman sacrifices everything
 to bring up her children

667
01:17:36,406 --> 01:17:38,616
She does them no favour!

668
01:17:38,616 --> 01:17:41,411
"Children aren't born
 on their own, Mama"

669
01:17:41,411 --> 01:17:45,749
They are borne. And those who
 bear them have the responsibility...

670
01:17:46,124 --> 01:17:51,171
of also bringing them up

671
01:17:52,088 --> 01:17:56,801
So you will tell me what
 my responsibilities are?

672
01:17:56,801 --> 01:17:59,220
If singing was my identity...

673
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:02,307
I always considered my children
 to be my heart-beat

674
01:18:02,307 --> 01:18:05,769
I was told not to have children.
 That it would affect my career

675
01:18:05,769 --> 01:18:09,814
But I wouldn't listen to anyone.
 - Not even to your own children

676
01:18:09,814 --> 01:18:13,777
Whatever you did was only for
 the sake of your career

677
01:18:13,777 --> 01:18:19,199
Only for the sake of your
 name and fame... that's it!

678
01:18:20,784 --> 01:18:25,538
"All right. Even if that is true,
 what's wrong with that?"

679
01:18:26,831 --> 01:18:31,294
"Had your father got all this fame,
 you'd have been proud of him"

680
01:18:31,294 --> 01:18:35,840
So why hold it against your mother?
 Only because she's a woman?

681
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,968
"I agree, I used to be very busy.
 But is that such a big crime?"

682
01:18:38,968 --> 01:18:41,805
You weren't just busy...

683
01:18:41,805 --> 01:18:44,808
"you were also careless, Mama"

684
01:18:44,808 --> 01:18:50,105
The biggest proof of your carelessness
 is Nazo!

685
01:18:50,105 --> 01:18:53,191
You had her sent to
 an institution!

686
01:18:53,191 --> 01:18:55,360
Not because she'd recover there...

687
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:59,280
but only because her pathetic face
 would remain out of your sight!

688
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:02,575
Forever!

689
01:19:03,159 --> 01:19:06,830
Such an accusation...?

690
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:11,292
Don't level such a huge
 accusation at me!

691
01:19:11,543 --> 01:19:16,923
Mercy... have mercy on me!

692
01:19:17,841 --> 01:19:22,178
Mercy...? How?

693
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:27,559
There used to be a big city
 in which lived a Queen

694
01:19:28,268 --> 01:19:32,439
The Queen had two
 pretty princesses

695
01:19:34,190 --> 01:19:37,277
One of the princesses was one day
 very cross with her Queen Mother

696
01:19:37,277 --> 01:19:40,947
Like my sister?
 - Well... maybe

697
01:19:40,947 --> 01:19:45,869
But her angst had a reason. She had
 a difficult question to ask her mother

698
01:19:46,202 --> 01:19:48,872
What for?

699
01:19:48,872 --> 01:19:51,875
Because there can't be stories
 without questions

700
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:56,880
"If I could help it, I'd never have
 separated Nazo from myself"

701
01:19:59,215 --> 01:20:02,886
But I couldn't bear to see
 her helplessness

702
01:20:02,886 --> 01:20:05,930
And that is why I had her
 sent to the hospital

703
01:20:05,930 --> 01:20:11,644
In the hope that
 she might be cured there

704
01:20:11,895 --> 01:20:17,192
But God wouldn't heed my prayers.
 So what was I to do?

705
01:20:19,361 --> 01:20:23,573
"After Anwar died, so many people
 told me to marry again"

706
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:28,119
But I never agreed

707
01:20:28,119 --> 01:20:30,914
I tried to make sure...

708
01:20:30,914 --> 01:20:35,585
that you'd never feel the
 absence of your father

709
01:20:35,919 --> 01:20:39,839
But you always considered me
 to be your enemy

710
01:20:39,839 --> 01:20:44,928
You even got married
 without asking me

711
01:20:44,928 --> 01:20:49,015
Without even informing me

712
01:20:49,974 --> 01:20:55,271
"That's because I had had
 enough of my Loneliness, Mama"

713
01:20:57,941 --> 01:21:01,986
To spend a lifetime watching TV
 within the confines of four walls...

714
01:21:01,986 --> 01:21:04,989
is very difficult

715
01:21:04,989 --> 01:21:10,328
I had decided. The first man
 who showed interest in me...

716
01:21:11,663 --> 01:21:15,375
would be the one I'd marry

717
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:20,714
"That Salim loves is,
 is a favour he's doing to me"

718
01:21:20,964 --> 01:21:25,427
"And that is why,
 you are jealous of me"

719
01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:30,515
So much of venom...?

720
01:21:30,515 --> 01:21:35,395
Where did you get so much
 of venom from?

721
01:21:35,979 --> 01:21:40,275
"You are the one who gave
 it all to me, Mama"

722
01:21:40,275 --> 01:21:44,529
It's your own venom that has
 destroyed an entire family

723
01:21:47,323 --> 01:21:50,326
Me...

724
01:21:50,326 --> 01:21:53,788
Nazo...

725
01:21:54,914 --> 01:21:58,585
and my father

726
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:08,595
Am I responsible
 for Anwar's death...?

727
01:22:09,179 --> 01:22:12,474
You...

728
01:22:14,559 --> 01:22:17,020
"you are the one, Mama"

729
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:21,232
Maybe my father would
 have been alive today...

730
01:22:21,232 --> 01:22:25,904
if he hadn't got to know
 about your lover

731
01:22:25,904 --> 01:22:29,657
That's a lie!

732
01:22:37,123 --> 01:22:41,378
Amazing! It didn't even hurt

733
01:23:00,939 --> 01:23:05,860
I'm writing a story on Tehzeeb.
 But the facts are all Joshina's

734
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:09,864
"Without Rukhsana and Jamal,
 my story won't be any fun"

735
01:23:09,864 --> 01:23:12,242
But what angle does one use
 to look at Rukhsana Jamal?

736
01:23:12,242 --> 01:23:15,662
That which would depict
 her true picture

737
01:23:15,662 --> 01:23:20,542
She's good and bad.
 Like a cough syrup

738
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:26,297
Sweet and bitter

739
01:23:26,589 --> 01:23:29,217
And poor Nazo

740
01:23:29,217 --> 01:23:32,887
She's lost in a world
 of her own

741
01:23:32,887 --> 01:23:37,308
And this how a family
 ought to be!

742
01:23:37,934 --> 01:23:40,979
Suman...

743
01:23:41,021 --> 01:23:44,274
forget that and get a taxi.
 For Bombay

744
01:23:44,274 --> 01:23:49,904
"Immediately!
 - All right, I'm going"

745
01:23:49,904 --> 01:23:54,242
Don't!
 - Let her go

746
01:23:59,789 --> 01:24:04,919
"My ma-in-law's going nuts..."

747
01:24:04,919 --> 01:24:07,797
Go on

748
01:24:26,941 --> 01:24:29,944
"If you're here to ask for forgiveness,
 that is not necessary"

749
01:24:29,944 --> 01:24:34,407
One forgives those who are
 ashamed at their mistake

750
01:24:34,407 --> 01:24:38,495
But you will never improve

751
01:24:39,037 --> 01:24:43,375
I have made no mistake. Nor have I
 come to ask for forgiveness

752
01:24:43,375 --> 01:24:48,380
So you've come to check
 whether I'm still around or gone?

753
01:24:49,297 --> 01:24:52,050
All I've come to tell you...

754
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:56,721
is to stay on till Nazo's birthday.
 Please

755
01:25:01,976 --> 01:25:03,978
Nazo's birthday...?

756
01:25:03,978 --> 01:25:10,068
"My happy birthday, Mama...
 Please stay on"

757
01:25:11,986 --> 01:25:17,659
No! It's not possible for me to stay
 in this house for another minute!

758
01:25:21,996 --> 01:25:25,750
"Mama, please...
 you must be there at my birthday"

759
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:30,505
"Look... Dolly, Rado, Clown...
 they're all going to be there"

760
01:25:31,006 --> 01:25:34,009
So are Tehzeeb and
 Salim-bhaijaan...

761
01:25:34,009 --> 01:25:37,762
"they're all going to be there!
 You must also be there, Mama"

762
01:25:37,762 --> 01:25:41,099
"Please come, Mama..."

763
01:25:41,099 --> 01:25:43,768
"All right, but you mustn't cry"

764
01:25:43,768 --> 01:25:47,105
I have a weak heart...
 I can't bear to see you shed tears

765
01:25:47,105 --> 01:25:51,443
"Nazo... no, don't cry.
 Mama will be there, okay?"

766
01:25:51,443 --> 01:25:54,487
Mama said she's not going away.
 - All right

767
01:25:54,487 --> 01:25:58,116
But I'm not staying a single day
 after your birthday

768
01:25:58,116 --> 01:26:02,704
"You're staying over, mama...?
 Oh, I love you!"

769
01:26:02,704 --> 01:26:05,832
My child!

770
01:26:20,138 --> 01:26:25,518
A fish is the queen of the waters.
 Her life is all about water

771
01:26:26,061 --> 01:26:28,980
Try to touch her...
 - She will be scared

772
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:33,735
Get her out...
 - And she'll die

773
01:26:52,087 --> 01:26:56,508
Madam... call for you.
 - Who is it?

774
01:26:57,509 --> 01:27:01,346
"Yes, go on"

775
01:27:01,596 --> 01:27:03,807
Why?

776
01:27:03,807 --> 01:27:07,102
Where? When...? Today?

777
01:27:07,102 --> 01:27:11,189
This is amazing.
 I just can't...

778
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:20,490
Moron!
 - Pardon me?

779
01:27:20,490 --> 01:27:21,825
I wasn't saying it to you

780
01:27:21,825 --> 01:27:24,035
Go ahead and smoke.
 Your own loss

781
01:27:24,035 --> 01:27:28,331
I was cursing my stupid secretary
 Bali the bull

782
01:27:29,124 --> 01:27:33,420
And what has Bali done?
 - You know producer Choksi...?

783
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:36,172
He wants to bring someone here
 to be introduced to me

784
01:27:36,172 --> 01:27:38,925
"And the ass that Bali is,
 he gave this address to him"

785
01:27:38,925 --> 01:27:42,053
I see. So when are they coming?

786
01:27:42,053 --> 01:27:44,222
They're not. I'll have to go over

787
01:27:44,222 --> 01:27:48,643
Is there a hotel here
 called Fair Lawns?

788
01:27:48,643 --> 01:27:50,270
They serve delicious food

789
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:55,608
"With the food, they give you
 a digestive. Free"

790
01:27:56,151 --> 01:28:01,156
Why don't all of you come with me?
 It'll be a nice outing

791
01:28:01,156 --> 01:28:05,160
No... what if Choksi minds?

792
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:09,164
To hell with Choksi

793
01:28:09,164 --> 01:28:12,625
Bring the tea quickly

794
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:18,590
God!

795
01:28:22,385 --> 01:28:26,181
My word! What a place!

796
01:28:26,181 --> 01:28:28,183
Why are you pulling me?

797
01:28:28,183 --> 01:28:31,436
"Will I get no work, unless I have
 Rukhsana Jamal's blessings?"

798
01:28:31,436 --> 01:28:35,648
"In our business, there are two
 answers to every question, Aloka baby"

799
01:28:35,648 --> 01:28:39,194
"The first answer is, so long
 as Choksi's with you..."

800
01:28:39,194 --> 01:28:42,197
where is the need for
 Rukhsana Jamal's blessings?

801
01:28:42,197 --> 01:28:44,783
"And the second is,
 the need is always there"

802
01:28:44,783 --> 01:28:46,868
If you want to live in the pond...

803
01:28:46,868 --> 01:28:49,120
there is no problem in befriending
 the crocodile

804
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:52,290
Is Rukhsana a crocodile
 to swallow a live man?

805
01:28:52,290 --> 01:28:54,584
I have just one answer
 to this question

806
01:28:54,584 --> 01:28:57,879
You must relax your vocal chords
 and your brains

807
01:28:57,879 --> 01:29:02,717
Because I'm the one who's going to do
 the talking. You've only got to smile

808
01:29:02,717 --> 01:29:07,889
Your lovely smile is
 going to make Rukhsana Jamal melt

809
01:29:07,889 --> 01:29:11,601
Is she an ice-cream to melt?
 - It's just a way of speaking

810
01:29:11,601 --> 01:29:14,229
And you're getting serious!
 Hey... let go of my hand

811
01:29:14,229 --> 01:29:18,149
"If someone sees that,
 it'll cause problems"

812
01:29:18,149 --> 01:29:21,236
"Let's get out of the car, c'mon.
 We've got to go"

813
01:29:21,236 --> 01:29:25,824
The first number is: 6332681.
 The second is: 6346129

814
01:29:26,241 --> 01:29:29,411
The third is 61... 34290

815
01:29:29,411 --> 01:29:33,915
So Mr. Choksi's here...
 with his latest girlfriend

816
01:29:35,375 --> 01:29:38,336
I wonder what's taking Mama so
 much of time in the parlor

817
01:29:38,336 --> 01:29:43,425
Must be sharpening her nails...
 to scratch Choksi's face

818
01:29:43,758 --> 01:29:48,346
So let's listen to Choksi's story

819
01:29:51,266 --> 01:29:56,271
"Watch your manners, lady...
 Madam hates noise"

820
01:29:56,271 --> 01:29:58,314
Why are you so scared of madam?

821
01:29:58,314 --> 01:30:03,278
"The first answer is, Choksi has no
 reason to be afraid of Rukhsana Jamal"

822
01:30:03,695 --> 01:30:06,281
"And the second is,
 I've got to be afraid"

823
01:30:06,281 --> 01:30:10,285
"Because if she's against it,
 no music company will touch my music"

824
01:30:10,285 --> 01:30:14,372
And your dreams of becoming a Lata
 Mangeshkar will be shattered

825
01:30:14,372 --> 01:30:17,375
I'm seeing other dreams now

826
01:30:17,375 --> 01:30:21,671
I will now become Rukhsana Jamal

827
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:29,721
Very good. Amazing confidence!
 Say that to Madam. Verbatim

828
01:30:29,721 --> 01:30:32,640
No one can stop you from
 becoming a star then

829
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:36,061
"But don't make me wait
 too much, Aloka baby"

830
01:30:36,061 --> 01:30:42,192
"Never, Choksu! Never!
 - My baby..."

831
01:30:47,405 --> 01:30:50,992
Madam... good afternoon!
 - Hello

832
01:30:50,992 --> 01:30:54,412
This is my daughter. Nazo

833
01:30:54,412 --> 01:30:58,792
This is Salim and that's Tehzeeb.
 - They were right here with us!

834
01:30:58,792 --> 01:31:03,421
"Sit down, madam... please.
 - Hello"

835
01:31:03,421 --> 01:31:07,384
"What urgency was it that
 brought you here, Mr. Choksi?"

836
01:31:07,384 --> 01:31:09,969
I was anyway coming to you
 for the recording next week

837
01:31:09,969 --> 01:31:13,765
It would have been too late by then.
 I needed this urgent introduction

838
01:31:13,765 --> 01:31:17,894
This is Aloka. She was going mad
 to meet you

839
01:31:17,894 --> 01:31:20,438
"She said, you're her Laxmi.
 - Saraswati"

840
01:31:20,438 --> 01:31:24,359
It's the same. Touch her feet.
 - It's all right

841
01:31:24,359 --> 01:31:27,696
"No, stay down there till she
 gives you her blessings"

842
01:31:27,696 --> 01:31:29,698
You have my blessings

843
01:31:29,698 --> 01:31:33,368
"Madam, you see her
 level of devotion?"

844
01:31:33,368 --> 01:31:36,162
Is she your leading lady?
 - A leading lady...

845
01:31:36,162 --> 01:31:40,125
and a singer too

846
01:31:40,375 --> 01:31:43,461
I see. So that's how it is?

847
01:31:43,461 --> 01:31:47,799
No... only if you
 give me the permission

848
01:31:49,384 --> 01:31:51,720
Why wouldn't I give the permission?

849
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:55,390
The industry's bursting with singers

850
01:31:55,390 --> 01:32:00,812
So many have come and gone away.
 - I'm not the one to go away

851
01:32:03,398 --> 01:32:08,069
"What she says is, the way
 you're still going strong..."

852
01:32:08,403 --> 01:32:11,656
"she will, well...
 how do I explain...?"

853
01:32:11,656 --> 01:32:13,992
Have you learnt something?
 Or is it just a passing fancy?

854
01:32:13,992 --> 01:32:16,411
I'm learning from the
 maestro Ghulam Abbas Khan

855
01:32:16,411 --> 01:32:21,583
"You won't believe me unless
 you hear her, madam"

856
01:32:21,583 --> 01:32:25,003
Get started

857
01:32:44,189 --> 01:32:46,858
"A lesson..."

858
01:32:46,858 --> 01:32:53,031
"You have taught me"

859
01:32:57,452 --> 01:33:01,456
"You've made me..."

860
01:33:01,456 --> 01:33:06,878
"forget everything else"

861
01:33:43,498 --> 01:33:48,503
"Giving once is like
 giving a million times..."

862
01:33:49,004 --> 01:33:54,843
"Your heart, You have
 given to me"

863
01:33:56,928 --> 01:34:03,893
"Everyone I met,
 was without desire"

864
01:34:12,444 --> 01:34:16,531
"You have given me..."

865
01:34:16,531 --> 01:34:21,911
"without any motive"

866
01:34:23,079 --> 01:34:25,123
"A lesson..."

867
01:34:25,123 --> 01:34:32,547
"You have taught me"

868
01:34:34,966 --> 01:34:38,553
"You've made me..."

869
01:34:38,553 --> 01:34:44,017
"forget everything else"

870
01:35:05,747 --> 01:35:13,088
"When a sinner like me
 has been spared..."

871
01:35:13,672 --> 01:35:20,387
"what have You given hell?"

872
01:35:21,596 --> 01:35:28,853
"Whatever I have got..."

873
01:35:29,187 --> 01:35:37,195
"I've got from you, Lord"

874
01:35:55,672 --> 01:35:57,716
"A lesson..."

875
01:35:57,716 --> 01:36:05,306
"You have taught me"

876
01:36:07,642 --> 01:36:11,980
"You've made me..."

877
01:36:12,313 --> 01:36:16,985
"forget everything else"

878
01:36:27,871 --> 01:36:31,833
You have the melody. And there's
 also feeling in your voice

879
01:36:31,833 --> 01:36:34,878
Am I right?
 - Absolutely

880
01:36:34,878 --> 01:36:38,757
Here's a piece of advise.
 It'll be useful for you

881
01:36:38,757 --> 01:36:43,678
To make it to the peak of glory
 is not a difficult task

882
01:36:43,678 --> 01:36:47,682
To stay there...

883
01:36:47,682 --> 01:36:51,644
is not everyone's cup of tea

884
01:36:52,103 --> 01:36:54,689
That was the blow!

885
01:36:54,689 --> 01:36:59,778
"Madam, amazing advise you've given
 this girl. Right in the beginning!"

886
01:37:00,695 --> 01:37:05,241
"The Sun's setting, Madam.
 We must leave now"

887
01:37:05,241 --> 01:37:07,869
"I mean, we must leave"

888
01:37:07,869 --> 01:37:11,122
Let's go

889
01:37:11,873 --> 01:37:15,043
Thank you so much
 for your precious time

890
01:37:15,043 --> 01:37:19,130
That's my mother-in-law!

891
01:37:29,391 --> 01:37:31,810
You're up early today.
 What's the matter?

892
01:37:31,810 --> 01:37:37,065
That cursed Bali's phone woke me up.
 - What did he have to say?

893
01:37:37,065 --> 01:37:40,735
"He says, although we're famous,
 we have very little work"

894
01:37:40,735 --> 01:37:43,655
"At this rate, we'll have to leave
 our flat at Malabar Hill..."

895
01:37:43,655 --> 01:37:48,326
and move to Lokhandwala.
 - That you'd have money problems...

896
01:37:48,743 --> 01:37:51,079
"I could never even imagine, Mama"

897
01:37:51,079 --> 01:37:53,832
What you see is not always
 the truth

898
01:37:53,832 --> 01:37:56,668
"Times don't always
 remain the same, my child"

899
01:37:56,668 --> 01:37:59,838
Why don't you quit singing?
 You can move in with us

900
01:37:59,838 --> 01:38:03,049
Can't quit singing
 until I quit the world

901
01:38:03,049 --> 01:38:07,303
Let's see who gets
 to that tree first

902
01:38:07,303 --> 01:38:09,180
"You'll lose, Mama"

903
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:14,185
You're challenging Rukhsana Jamal?!
 Let's see!

904
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:28,950
You lost deliberately

905
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:33,872
If you've won...
 isn't it my victory too?

906
01:38:42,964 --> 01:38:47,260
It's going to be difficult to go away
 if you show me so much of affection

907
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:50,722
Who wants you to go away anyway?
 - You can't go away!

908
01:38:50,722 --> 01:38:53,308
You're staying here! With us!

909
01:38:53,308 --> 01:38:57,896
And you will play with us!
 - You're hitting me...? Imp!

910
01:39:12,827 --> 01:39:16,998
How come...?
 What do you like about me?

911
01:39:16,998 --> 01:39:20,085
Everything!

912
01:39:20,919 --> 01:39:24,005
And you...?

913
01:39:24,005 --> 01:39:26,383
Your hands.
 - Hands?

914
01:39:26,383 --> 01:39:31,554
Yes. Remember when I fell ill
 as a child...? I had typhoid

915
01:39:33,014 --> 01:39:36,601
You had given up all your work
 to stay with me

916
01:39:36,601 --> 01:39:40,855
You were with me for five days.
 You'd run your hand over my head...

917
01:39:41,856 --> 01:39:46,528
and then touch my cheeks
 to check if I still had the fever

918
01:39:46,528 --> 01:39:49,989
You'd then raise both your hands
 in prayer...

919
01:39:49,989 --> 01:39:53,201
"Lord, save my daughter"

920
01:39:53,201 --> 01:39:56,913
I remember how scared I was.
 For three days...

921
01:39:56,913 --> 01:40:01,084
your fever was stuck at 103 degrees!

922
01:40:01,084 --> 01:40:05,547
"And ever since,
 I wanted to remain ill forever!"

923
01:40:06,214 --> 01:40:08,383
Why?
 - So you could remain at home...

924
01:40:08,383 --> 01:40:10,885
with me!

925
01:40:10,885 --> 01:40:14,931
Remember? I always used to complain
 of stomach-aches and pains...?

926
01:40:14,931 --> 01:40:17,892
There was nothing of the sort.
 It was all a drama

927
01:40:17,892 --> 01:40:22,647
Brat!
 - I wanted to tie you down to me!

928
01:40:24,899 --> 01:40:28,361
I never felt bad
 when you went to work

929
01:40:28,361 --> 01:40:32,699
"But you never once turn around
 to wave at me, when you left"

930
01:40:34,367 --> 01:40:37,162
And that always irked me

931
01:40:37,162 --> 01:40:41,666
"Mama, I have a fever too. See!"

932
01:40:49,924 --> 01:40:52,260
How long is this blah-blah
 continuing at this seminar?

933
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:55,013
Till one in the morning or two...?

934
01:40:55,013 --> 01:40:59,684
I'm starved and these guys
 aren't even taking a break

935
01:41:00,226 --> 01:41:04,022
So how far have you got
 with your novel?

936
01:41:04,022 --> 01:41:08,109
"Right now, it's still
 at the doorstep"

937
01:41:08,109 --> 01:41:11,946
It's easy for you to
 write love-stories

938
01:41:11,946 --> 01:41:17,452
But you find it difficult to write
 about life and its realities?

939
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:23,708
Writing fiction is easy.
 Not facts

940
01:41:25,669 --> 01:41:29,339
So tell me...
 what is the problem?

941
01:41:29,339 --> 01:41:33,301
"There ought to be a distance
 between friends, Sheena"

942
01:41:33,301 --> 01:41:36,012
What for?
 - Because...

943
01:41:36,012 --> 01:41:40,475
"gossip spreads like wildfire.
 "People are bound to talk!"

944
01:41:40,975 --> 01:41:43,978
So let them!

945
01:41:43,978 --> 01:41:46,481
My wife will throw me
 out of the house

946
01:41:46,481 --> 01:41:49,984
You can come to my place!
 - Now look...

947
01:41:49,984 --> 01:41:55,073
"what's all this about?
 You're not in love with me, are you?"

948
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:59,869
It's the truth

949
01:42:05,333 --> 01:42:10,005
"Song sequence from the film
 "Umrao Jaan" starring Rekha"

950
01:42:36,031 --> 01:42:40,368
"Song sequence from the film
 "Brahmachari" starring Shammi Kapoor"

951
01:43:00,055 --> 01:43:04,392
"Song sequence from the film"Satyam
 Shivam Sundaram"starring Zeenat Aman"

952
01:43:32,087 --> 01:43:36,675
"Song sequence from the film"Mr India
 "starring Sridevi"

953
01:43:52,899 --> 01:43:58,780
"Song sequence from the"Gumnaam
 "starring Mehmood"

954
01:44:19,634 --> 01:44:24,347
"I entertained you, made you smile,
 made you laugh..."

955
01:44:24,347 --> 01:44:28,143
give me a reward!

956
01:44:28,143 --> 01:44:30,145
Here you are

957
01:44:30,145 --> 01:44:34,649
"What a talented girl!
 - Pendant for me, ring for you"

958
01:44:36,234 --> 01:44:39,738
My children!

959
01:44:57,547 --> 01:45:01,051
Who's there...?

960
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:21,321
Thief! You're stealing here...?

961
01:45:21,321 --> 01:45:26,993
Tehzeeb! Thief! Thief!

962
01:45:28,078 --> 01:45:32,290
Throw that bat away!
 Throw it away!

963
01:45:33,208 --> 01:45:35,752
I'll kill you!

964
01:45:35,752 --> 01:45:38,880
Throw that bat away! Go on!

965
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:43,301
Get lost... beat it!

966
01:45:44,302 --> 01:45:48,723
Don't you move! It's a loaded gun.
 I'll shoot

967
01:45:48,723 --> 01:45:51,226
Throw that knife away... throw it!
 - Relax...

968
01:45:51,226 --> 01:45:53,103
I'm not a thief. I'm just hungry

969
01:45:53,103 --> 01:45:56,231
So you were taking the
 vessels away to cook a meal?

970
01:45:56,231 --> 01:46:00,735
You were stealing the vessels?
 - Call the police. Hurry up

971
01:46:01,236 --> 01:46:05,990
Don't move... don't!

972
01:46:08,576 --> 01:46:11,329
He has run away!
 He has escaped!

973
01:46:11,329 --> 01:46:14,249
"Are you okay, Mama?
 - Yes, I'm fine"

974
01:46:14,249 --> 01:46:19,587
But this revolver...?
 - It's Salim's... this revolver

975
01:46:20,964 --> 01:46:23,258
You're amazing! What if
 something had happened to you?

976
01:46:23,258 --> 01:46:28,054
So? Life has given me many wounds.
 What's another?

977
01:46:28,054 --> 01:46:30,473
Weren't you scared?
 - I was

978
01:46:30,473 --> 01:46:33,268
I thought you'd fire

979
01:46:33,268 --> 01:46:36,396
Put it away. How long will you
 keep holding it?

980
01:46:36,396 --> 01:46:40,358
Ask Salim to return home
 on time

981
01:46:40,358 --> 01:46:43,278
I'll go and keep this back

982
01:46:43,278 --> 01:46:47,157
Looks like it

983
01:48:28,091 --> 01:48:30,927
Sweetheart...

984
01:48:30,927 --> 01:48:33,388
forgive me. But my train was held up
 on the tracks last night

985
01:48:33,388 --> 01:48:36,391
I had to spend the whole night
 in the train

986
01:48:36,391 --> 01:48:41,146
What's up? You're a bit too
 angry today

987
01:49:11,843 --> 01:49:18,433
"When a pretty girl
 is angry..."

988
01:49:18,933 --> 01:49:25,023
"she looks even prettier"

989
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:32,030
"When the train leaves
 the station..."

990
01:49:32,530 --> 01:49:34,449
"oh yes..."

991
01:49:34,449 --> 01:49:40,538
"it races away"

992
01:49:43,166 --> 01:49:47,212
You don't trust me
 even so much?

993
01:50:12,654 --> 01:50:17,367
You're here to meet Salim...?
 He's not at home!

994
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:22,747
I can understand what must've happened
 here in the last couple of hours

995
01:50:22,747 --> 01:50:28,128
I'm responsible for whatever
 the newspaper has published

996
01:50:28,670 --> 01:50:32,298
We have no relationship
 whatsoever

997
01:50:32,298 --> 01:50:37,512
The truth is that I used my contacts
 to have the photographs published

998
01:50:37,512 --> 01:50:39,889
To give yourself and Salim
 a bad name?

999
01:50:39,889 --> 01:50:43,184
I had no other choice!

1000
01:50:43,184 --> 01:50:46,187
But what did you gain
 by doing all this?

1001
01:50:46,187 --> 01:50:50,525
I've got back the man
 I can't live without!

1002
01:50:53,528 --> 01:50:55,864
I'm madly in love with Sujoy

1003
01:50:55,864 --> 01:50:59,576
He's the one I've returned
 to India for

1004
01:50:59,576 --> 01:51:04,622
So...?
 - He never appreciated my love

1005
01:51:06,541 --> 01:51:10,003
"I knew, I could have him back"

1006
01:51:10,003 --> 01:51:13,548
If he saw me with someone else

1007
01:51:13,548 --> 01:51:16,426
I wanted him to be tormented too

1008
01:51:16,426 --> 01:51:20,764
So that he'd fold his hands and
 come back to you on his knees?

1009
01:51:20,764 --> 01:51:26,644
He has called me a dozen times
 since this morning

1010
01:51:28,563 --> 01:51:32,650
But I don't know

1011
01:51:35,570 --> 01:51:40,658
You didn't think of Salim even once
 when you did all this

1012
01:51:46,581 --> 01:51:48,792
I wanted to convey to Sujoy...

1013
01:51:48,792 --> 01:51:52,962
that he can't treat women
 like his personal property

1014
01:51:52,962 --> 01:51:57,676
"Tehzeeb, please try
 and understand me"

1015
01:52:02,639 --> 01:52:07,227
I'm the guilty party.
 Not him

1016
01:52:07,644 --> 01:52:13,274
"In the publishing business, you've sure
 learnt the art of playing with words"

1017
01:52:13,274 --> 01:52:18,405
"But it's difficult to utter
 such words, Tehzeeb"

1018
01:52:51,646 --> 01:52:55,650
"My young sweetheart,
 my handsome hunk..."

1019
01:52:55,650 --> 01:52:59,654
"I've lost my heart to you"

1020
01:52:59,654 --> 01:53:03,533
"The hunter is himself
 the prey"

1021
01:53:03,533 --> 01:53:08,747
"What injustice is this...?
 What tyranny is this...?"

1022
01:53:11,666 --> 01:53:16,755
What if my picture was published in
 the newspaper instead of yours?

1023
01:53:20,675 --> 01:53:25,472
"Salim, we share a relationship.
 Of faith"

1024
01:53:26,765 --> 01:53:32,145
And it's a very delicate one.
 Isn't it?

1025
01:54:12,811 --> 01:54:16,815
For you... don't drop it

1026
01:54:18,066 --> 01:54:21,736
You just can't stand straight

1027
01:54:21,736 --> 01:54:24,781
And this is for you!

1028
01:54:24,781 --> 01:54:29,786
So what do you want from me?
 - But you've given me already

1029
01:54:29,786 --> 01:54:33,081
"That's nothing, my child.
 If I could..."

1030
01:54:33,081 --> 01:54:37,752
I'd give away the world to you.
 Ask whatever you want to

1031
01:54:37,752 --> 01:54:41,631
Don't go away

1032
01:54:41,756 --> 01:54:47,429
"I'll have to go, my child.
 There's so much of work to do"

1033
01:54:47,762 --> 01:54:50,682
Go away

1034
01:54:50,682 --> 01:54:52,767
Good girl

1035
01:54:52,767 --> 01:54:56,771
I'm going with you

1036
01:54:56,771 --> 01:55:00,233
Sure. Why not?

1037
01:55:00,233 --> 01:55:04,571
What could be better for me that
 my little bird's going with me?

1038
01:55:05,780 --> 01:55:09,242
"In any case, I don't like
 to be by myself at home"

1039
01:55:09,242 --> 01:55:14,873
"Mama, don't make false promises
 to Nazo"

1040
01:55:16,583 --> 01:55:20,462
Nazo darling... don't you
 like to live with us?

1041
01:55:20,462 --> 01:55:24,799
"I do, but it's better
 to be with Mama"

1042
01:55:24,799 --> 01:55:26,801
All right then

1043
01:55:26,801 --> 01:55:30,805
"I'll go first and tidy your room,
 hire a nurse for you..."

1044
01:55:30,805 --> 01:55:33,808
"and then call my little
 Nazo over, okay?"

1045
01:55:33,808 --> 01:55:36,144
I'm going with you

1046
01:55:36,144 --> 01:55:39,147
"Nazo, you mustn't be stubborn"

1047
01:55:39,147 --> 01:55:44,361
"Nazo, if you go away, who will
 play snakes-and-ladders with me?"

1048
01:55:45,320 --> 01:55:49,532
"Suman, get the snakes-and-ladders
 board quickly"

1049
01:55:49,532 --> 01:55:52,202
"Nazo, you will leave us
 and go away?"

1050
01:55:52,202 --> 01:55:54,204
I'm going with Mama

1051
01:55:54,204 --> 01:55:58,416
"Take her away with you, Madam.
 Look how tormented she is"

1052
01:56:00,168 --> 01:56:03,505
You keep out of this

1053
01:56:03,505 --> 01:56:07,592
How she controls her feelings!

1054
01:56:07,842 --> 01:56:11,846
So you taught your maid servant
 to be so insolent?

1055
01:56:11,846 --> 01:56:15,642
Isn't today a happy day?

1056
01:56:16,851 --> 01:56:21,272
My little girl's eating
 the cake now!

1057
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:34,471
"Break..."

1058
01:57:34,471 --> 01:57:39,017
"the shackles"

1059
01:57:45,273 --> 01:57:48,985
"Break..."

1060
01:57:48,985 --> 01:57:52,447
"the chains"

1061
01:57:52,447 --> 01:57:55,950
"Break..."

1062
01:57:55,950 --> 01:58:01,039
"the shackles"

1063
01:58:21,351 --> 01:58:24,979
"Break..."

1064
01:58:24,979 --> 01:58:28,441
"the chains"

1065
02:00:35,110 --> 02:00:40,699
"My child, don't give your mother
 such a cruel punishment"

1066
02:00:56,172 --> 02:01:00,885
Lord Almighty!
 Save my child!

1067
02:01:05,348 --> 02:01:09,561
I've told you. She was playing
 with it and the gun went off

1068
02:01:10,145 --> 02:01:12,147
I've heard that already

1069
02:01:12,147 --> 02:01:15,483
What I'm asking is who's
 the owner of this revolver?

1070
02:01:15,483 --> 02:01:20,155
"I mean, in whose name
 is it licensed?"

1071
02:01:20,155 --> 02:01:23,533
You'll have the details of the license
 in just a few days

1072
02:01:23,533 --> 02:01:27,162
"Which means, this gun does
 not belong to you"

1073
02:01:27,162 --> 02:01:32,500
Now look. I've met the Magistrate.
 He's a personal friend

1074
02:01:33,168 --> 02:01:36,171
"When Nazo is better, I will personally
 come to the police station and..."

1075
02:01:36,171 --> 02:01:40,842
"Because the Magistrate is your friend,
 no one has been arrested yet"

1076
02:01:40,842 --> 02:01:43,219
This is a case of suicide

1077
02:01:43,219 --> 02:01:45,889
It can even be a case of
 attempted murder

1078
02:01:45,889 --> 02:01:49,225
So what do you want to do?
 Arrest me...?

1079
02:01:49,225 --> 02:01:51,186
So go ahead

1080
02:01:51,186 --> 02:01:56,274
Why do you police always harass
 people instead of helping them?

1081
02:02:09,287 --> 02:02:11,247
But nothing can be said yet

1082
02:02:11,247 --> 02:02:15,293
"The bullet was lodged in the neck,
 she has lost a lot of blood"

1083
02:02:15,293 --> 02:02:18,213
Anything could happen

1084
02:02:18,213 --> 02:02:22,592
"Doctor, will Nazo live or not?
 - Please be patient..."

1085
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:25,470
Will she survive or not...?
 Tell me!

1086
02:02:25,470 --> 02:02:28,682
"Even if it's a lie,
 say she will survive, doctor!"

1087
02:02:28,682 --> 02:02:32,602
Say there's no cause for worry...
 why are you staring like that at me?

1088
02:02:32,602 --> 02:02:36,564
"Are you guys not bothered at all?
 Say something, demit!"

1089
02:02:36,564 --> 02:02:40,902
What kind of doctors are they?
 Salim...

1090
02:02:40,902 --> 02:02:44,280
They're doing their best.
 - What was he saying to you...

1091
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:48,243
"before I came out, Salim?
 What was he saying...?"

1092
02:02:48,243 --> 02:02:52,372
The bullet hit her neck.
 It's a deep injury

1093
02:02:52,372 --> 02:02:56,668
Nazo's life...
 - Is in Allah's hands?

1094
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:16,021
"Allah... save my Nazo, Lord"

1095
02:03:16,271 --> 02:03:20,150
Save my Nazo

1096
02:03:40,378 --> 02:03:41,838
O Merciful Lord...

1097
02:03:41,838 --> 02:03:47,385
"Lord, save my daughter...
 save my daughter, please"

1098
02:04:19,125 --> 02:04:24,422
"Lord Ganesha...
 save the poor child, please"

1099
02:04:31,346 --> 02:04:34,641
Tea

1100
02:04:38,645 --> 02:04:42,816
"This is no time to be angry,
 my child. Drink it up"

1101
02:04:42,816 --> 02:04:46,444
"Don't touch me!
 - What insolence is this, Tehzeeb?"

1102
02:04:46,444 --> 02:04:49,364
Sorrow mustn't drive you mad!
 - It has happened because of you!

1103
02:04:49,364 --> 02:04:53,743
Only you! Why did you come at all
 to set our world on fire...?

1104
02:04:53,743 --> 02:04:56,705
Thank you so much!

1105
02:04:56,705 --> 02:04:59,708
You've ruined everything!
 Are you happy now?

1106
02:04:59,708 --> 02:05:02,669
"Are you satisfied...?
 Go away, please. Go away!"

1107
02:05:02,669 --> 02:05:05,046
"Come to your senses, Tehzeeb!
 Don't create a scene!"

1108
02:05:05,046 --> 02:05:07,757
You're the one who creates a scene!

1109
02:05:07,757 --> 02:05:11,386
With your dramatics of love
 and affection as a mother!

1110
02:05:11,386 --> 02:05:14,639
You love no one
 except yourself!

1111
02:05:14,639 --> 02:05:17,392
You first swallowed my father.
 And now my sister...?

1112
02:05:17,392 --> 02:05:22,397
"Please hear me out, Tehzeeb...
 - I don't want to listen to anything!"

1113
02:05:22,397 --> 02:05:25,400
You will have to listen!
 - No!

1114
02:05:25,400 --> 02:05:28,486
You start a trial against me...

1115
02:05:28,486 --> 02:05:32,657
"and even deliver the verdict.
 Your case, your arguments..."

1116
02:05:32,657 --> 02:05:36,494
and your judgment!

1117
02:05:36,911 --> 02:05:39,748
"You think I'm your
 father's killer, isn't it?"

1118
02:05:39,748 --> 02:05:42,417
You think wrong!

1119
02:05:42,417 --> 02:05:46,421
"When all this happened,
 you were still a child"

1120
02:05:46,421 --> 02:05:48,757
The mind of an impressionable
 little child...

1121
02:05:48,757 --> 02:05:52,427
can't understand the
 complexity of relationships

1122
02:05:52,427 --> 02:05:55,972
Anwar and I were not
 just man and wife

1123
02:05:55,972 --> 02:05:59,100
We loved each other

1124
02:05:59,100 --> 02:06:04,105
"For my sake, he left his parents,
 his house and all his wealth"

1125
02:06:05,231 --> 02:06:09,569
And I forgot about my world
 and went to live in his

1126
02:06:09,569 --> 02:06:13,448
You were born then.
 So was Nazo...

1127
02:06:13,448 --> 02:06:17,911
and our needs went on increasing.
 I started singing again

1128
02:06:19,454 --> 02:06:22,499
The melodies that were meant
 only for myself...

1129
02:06:22,499 --> 02:06:26,920
started fending for a family

1130
02:06:28,338 --> 02:06:33,468
"To begin with, Anwar liked my work,
 my fame and glory very much"

1131
02:06:34,469 --> 02:06:36,680
But gradually...

1132
02:06:36,680 --> 02:06:40,809
when people started thinking of him
 as just a shadow of mine...

1133
02:06:40,809 --> 02:06:45,897
he did what all the weaklings do

1134
02:06:46,481 --> 02:06:50,568
He sought refuge
 in the bottle

1135
02:06:50,610 --> 02:06:55,031
When I returned home
 that night...

1136
02:06:58,159 --> 02:07:02,247
I can do anything for you

1137
02:07:02,497 --> 02:07:06,584
Of course. Try me out

1138
02:07:09,838 --> 02:07:14,592
It's very late.
 Go home now

1139
02:07:22,517 --> 02:07:26,521
"Welcome, welcome... sweetheart!"

1140
02:07:26,521 --> 02:07:29,399
Come to me too!

1141
02:07:29,399 --> 02:07:33,611
You're looking very
 beautiful today!

1142
02:07:33,611 --> 02:07:35,572
What's gotten into you today?

1143
02:07:35,572 --> 02:07:39,951
You're showing me love
 after all these years?

1144
02:07:41,911 --> 02:07:46,583
I can't think of an appropriate poem
 to describe your tresses right now

1145
02:07:46,583 --> 02:07:51,046
"And even I did,
 I still wouldn't recite it"

1146
02:07:51,046 --> 02:07:55,884
One does not adorn his beloved
 with borrowed flowers

1147
02:07:55,884 --> 02:07:59,971
You've had too much to drink

1148
02:08:00,263 --> 02:08:05,477
"For all times to come,
 the bottle is empty"

1149
02:08:05,477 --> 02:08:09,814
What do you mean?
 - Just that...

1150
02:08:09,814 --> 02:08:14,652
I give it up forever

1151
02:08:16,571 --> 02:08:21,326
Swear it on me.
 - I swear it on you!

1152
02:08:24,579 --> 02:08:28,166
May I say something?

1153
02:08:28,166 --> 02:08:32,253
Look after my children

1154
02:08:33,380 --> 02:08:35,590
What do you mean?

1155
02:08:35,590 --> 02:08:37,634
I mean...

1156
02:08:37,634 --> 02:08:42,180
you'll be the only one for them
 after I'm gone

1157
02:08:42,180 --> 02:08:47,227
"What rubbish are you talking, Anwar?
 What are you saying?"

1158
02:08:50,647 --> 02:08:54,693
Anwar! What are you doing?

1159
02:08:55,610 --> 02:08:59,364
Leave me alone!

1160
02:09:05,161 --> 02:09:09,249
What have you done...?

1161
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:21,636
What you saw was right...

1162
02:09:21,636 --> 02:09:24,639
"but the conclusion you reached,
 was wrong"

1163
02:09:24,639 --> 02:09:28,643
The truth is that it wasn't me
 or my fame or my admirers...

1164
02:09:28,643 --> 02:09:32,731
that were responsible
 for his death

1165
02:09:32,731 --> 02:09:37,110
It was his pride and his sense of
 helplessness that killed him

1166
02:09:38,695 --> 02:09:42,991
Life didn't give him
 the position he deserved

1167
02:09:42,991 --> 02:09:46,661
And he couldn't take the defeat

1168
02:09:46,661 --> 02:09:49,998
It gnawed away at his insides...

1169
02:09:49,998 --> 02:09:54,461
"and one day, he fell on all of us
 like a hollow wall"

1170
02:09:56,046 --> 02:10:00,675
And we're still buried
 under the debris

1171
02:10:19,694 --> 02:10:23,114
Mother...

1172
02:10:36,711 --> 02:10:41,466
Allah! Thanks a million

1173
02:10:57,732 --> 02:11:00,944
Good girl

1174
02:11:00,944 --> 02:11:02,112
Enough

1175
02:11:02,112 --> 02:11:07,534
How will you get well
 if you don't eat it all?

1176
02:11:08,910 --> 02:11:12,997
It's spicy.
 - Spicy...?

1177
02:11:13,748 --> 02:11:16,793
Liar! Look at the excuses
 she's making

1178
02:11:16,793 --> 02:11:20,422
"It's so nice, even I couldn't
 have made it like this"

1179
02:11:20,422 --> 02:11:22,799
Is it really nice
 or are you kidding Nazo?

1180
02:11:22,799 --> 02:11:27,637
"I swear it's so nice,
 I've begun to feel hungry"

1181
02:11:27,762 --> 02:11:30,807
It's very nice to hear
 praise coming from your lips

1182
02:11:30,807 --> 02:11:33,768
That's because I never
 indulge in false praise

1183
02:11:33,768 --> 02:11:38,189
"Liars will be bitten
 by the black crow..."

1184
02:11:39,816 --> 02:11:43,528
Are you okay?

1185
02:11:45,780 --> 02:11:51,870
"Tehzeeb, why are you always
 scared to take a decision?"

1186
02:11:52,454 --> 02:11:58,335
Maybe because decisions aren't
 taken on one's own

1187
02:11:58,793 --> 02:12:03,298
Maybe I've always looked at things
 only from my point of view

1188
02:12:05,842 --> 02:12:10,805
And you have put up with all my
 childishness without ever complaining

1189
02:12:13,308 --> 02:12:17,812
"Salim, I was always scared
 to say something"

1190
02:12:20,690 --> 02:12:23,818
But I can say it today

1191
02:12:23,818 --> 02:12:27,906
"I love you very much, Salim"

1192
02:12:33,828 --> 02:12:36,206
Look in my eyes...

1193
02:12:36,206 --> 02:12:40,043
what do you see?

1194
02:12:40,043 --> 02:12:45,840
"My sweetheart, who loves me
 more dearly than his own life"

1195
02:12:48,551 --> 02:12:52,055
So take my advise.
 - Yes?

1196
02:12:52,055 --> 02:12:56,267
Let Nazo go.
 She belongs with her mother

1197
02:12:56,267 --> 02:13:00,855
"No, Salim.
 I can't bring myself about to"

1198
02:13:00,855 --> 02:13:05,026
Whenever you're ill...

1199
02:13:05,860 --> 02:13:11,741
whose comforting hand do you
 first seek...? Tell me the truth

1200
02:13:16,663 --> 02:13:19,958
Mother

1201
02:13:22,877 --> 02:13:26,131
Mother!

1202
02:13:38,893 --> 02:13:43,898
"You don't thank your
 dear ones, Rukhsana-ji"

1203
02:13:43,898 --> 02:13:48,361
Not Rukhsana-ji... It's Mama

1204
02:13:59,581 --> 02:14:04,919
"I misunderstood you, Salim.
 But you're a very nice man"

1205
02:14:04,919 --> 02:14:09,257
You have given Tehzeeb and Nazo
 so much of love

1206
02:14:11,926 --> 02:14:15,930
"Actually, I was also under
 the wrong notion..."

1207
02:14:15,930 --> 02:14:20,310
that you were in love with
 only yourself and your career

1208
02:14:20,310 --> 02:14:24,272
"But now I realize, you were
 fighting against circumstances"

1209
02:14:24,272 --> 02:14:29,569
You turned your weakness
 into your strength

1210
02:14:29,944 --> 02:14:32,614
Wise boy

1211
02:14:32,614 --> 02:14:37,035
"I know, it's you who has made
 Tehzeeb agree to return Nazo to me"

1212
02:14:38,328 --> 02:14:43,625
That I'm now strong enough to
 take responsibility for Nazo

1213
02:14:44,959 --> 02:14:50,757
That is your right... mother

1214
02:14:50,965 --> 02:14:53,635
"You don't talk about rights
 with your dear ones, okay?"

1215
02:14:53,635 --> 02:14:56,304
When I come visiting you again...

1216
02:14:56,304 --> 02:15:00,975
I want to see a little princess
 and a little prince!

1217
02:15:00,975 --> 02:15:04,854
Won't you make me a grandmother?

1218
02:15:09,984 --> 02:15:14,739
The taxi will be here any moment.
 I'll take a stroll till then

1219
02:15:17,992 --> 02:15:21,663
"Hurry up, Suman...
 you forgot this"

1220
02:15:21,663 --> 02:15:27,002
"Baby, don't let Nazo go away.
 Let her stay here"

1221
02:15:27,460 --> 02:15:30,046
The house will be
 so Lonely without her

1222
02:15:30,046 --> 02:15:31,923
Please don't let her go away

1223
02:15:31,923 --> 02:15:34,134
"Nazo's my little doll, Suman"

1224
02:15:34,134 --> 02:15:38,013
"But one has to part with
 the doll someday, isn't it?"

1225
02:15:38,013 --> 02:15:43,101
And she really belongs with Mama.
 - The taxi is about to arrive

1226
02:15:43,101 --> 02:15:45,520
And Mama's in the garden

1227
02:15:45,520 --> 02:15:50,442
I've got to talk to her...
 what's her mood like?

1228
02:15:52,235 --> 02:15:55,363
She has what she wanted.
 Mr. Bali has sent word...

1229
02:15:55,363 --> 02:16:00,785
that she's the one who will
 sing that song for Mr. Choksi

1230
02:16:02,037 --> 02:16:06,207
Looks like Choksi's wife didn't
 let Aloka sing the number after all

1231
02:16:09,711 --> 02:16:12,088
And there's also a contract
 for another new album

1232
02:16:12,088 --> 02:16:17,052
Our Nazo will now live
 like a queen at Malabar Hill

1233
02:16:24,434 --> 02:16:27,062
Come with me

1234
02:16:27,062 --> 02:16:31,066
I've got to ask for her forgiveness

1235
02:16:31,066 --> 02:16:37,072
One asks for forgiveness
 with all her heart

1236
02:16:37,072 --> 02:16:41,076
And maybe I'm late in apologizing...

1237
02:16:41,076 --> 02:16:44,120
but she'll have to forgive me

1238
02:16:44,120 --> 02:16:48,833
Take Nazo along.
 You won't need me

1239
02:17:31,710 --> 02:17:35,797
"Quietly, okay...?"

1240
02:17:39,926 --> 02:17:44,180
Mama... please listen to me

1241
02:17:44,180 --> 02:17:47,809
"As a child, I tried my best
 to get closer to you"

1242
02:17:47,809 --> 02:17:49,394
But I was still very aloof

1243
02:17:49,394 --> 02:17:53,857
I treated Nazo like my child...
 not yours

1244
02:17:53,857 --> 02:17:57,485
I used to hide and imitate
 your style of singing

1245
02:17:57,485 --> 02:18:00,613
But imitation does not
 make someone an artist

1246
02:18:00,613 --> 02:18:05,368
I was very selfish. I didn't
 share Nazo's innocence with you

1247
02:18:06,161 --> 02:18:09,664
I thought you were
 a honey laced dagger...

1248
02:18:09,664 --> 02:18:12,250
whose show of affection was
 false and pretentious

1249
02:18:12,250 --> 02:18:14,210
That was a very big mistake I made

1250
02:18:14,210 --> 02:18:18,590
"Mama, it was always you who
 extended a hand in friendship"

1251
02:18:18,590 --> 02:18:22,260
You were the one who
 took the first step

1252
02:18:22,260 --> 02:18:26,431
You must always have thought that
 your child is after all your child

1253
02:18:28,600 --> 02:18:32,187
And in exchange for all
 that you did for me...

1254
02:18:32,187 --> 02:18:35,190
I gave you only humiliation

1255
02:18:35,190 --> 02:18:40,528
You made another attempt to revive
 our relationship and our love

1256
02:18:41,196 --> 02:18:46,284
I never enquired about your health.
 I never did

1257
02:18:46,826 --> 02:18:50,914
I've got to ask you
 for forgiveness

1258
02:18:51,206 --> 02:18:55,210
Didn't you once tell me...?

1259
02:18:55,210 --> 02:19:00,632
"Unless you really feel like it,
 once must not ask for forgiveness?"

1260
02:19:01,257 --> 02:19:05,845
I ask for your forgiveness
 with all my heart today

1261
02:19:07,138 --> 02:19:11,768
I thought you were guilty.
 Always

1262
02:19:12,227 --> 02:19:17,315
"I insulted you and
 humiliated you, Mama"

1263
02:19:19,693 --> 02:19:24,322
The name you gave me Tehzeeb
 (etiquette)...

1264
02:19:25,240 --> 02:19:29,327
I heaped insult on that too

1265
02:19:32,247 --> 02:19:36,334
"You're my Mama, aren't you?"

1266
02:19:36,626 --> 02:19:40,922
I know you will forgive me

1267
02:19:42,590 --> 02:19:47,345
"But do not be silent
 like this, please"

1268
02:19:49,264 --> 02:19:52,434
Please accept my apologies...

1269
02:19:52,434 --> 02:19:56,771
so I can be relieved of the burden
 on my heart and my conscience

1270
02:20:00,275 --> 02:20:04,029
"Accept my apologies, Mama..."

1271
02:20:11,828 --> 02:20:15,874
"No, Mama... no!"

1272
02:21:09,219 --> 02:21:12,138
She had had a massive
 heart-attack

1273
02:21:12,138 --> 02:21:15,350
She never took care of her illness...

1274
02:21:15,350 --> 02:21:20,438
and kept the ailment
 a secret from everyone

1275
02:21:27,904 --> 02:21:33,034
"Maybe Tehzeeb's story,
 our story..."

1276
02:21:34,327 --> 02:21:37,080
could have only
 this logical ending

1277
02:21:37,080 --> 02:21:42,794
Life's stories are written on hearts

1278
02:21:42,961 --> 02:21:45,380
Not on paper

1279
02:21:45,380 --> 02:21:49,467
Never on paper

1280
02:21:53,430 --> 02:21:59,185
I'm singing for my mother today.
 Only for her

1281
02:22:00,770 --> 02:22:05,108
People gave her a lot of adulation
 and love

1282
02:22:05,942 --> 02:22:10,321
And also unleashed on her
 many a storm

1283
02:22:10,321 --> 02:22:12,449
Although she's not here today...

1284
02:22:12,449 --> 02:22:15,452
my mother lives in my soul

1285
02:22:15,452 --> 02:22:17,746
I'm her voice

1286
02:22:17,746 --> 02:22:22,834
I'm her Tehzeeb

1287
02:22:46,441 --> 02:22:51,946
"People unleashed
 storms on me..."

1288
02:22:55,450 --> 02:23:00,789
"although I did nothing"

1289
02:23:16,471 --> 02:23:23,478
"Even as I was going
 about my own thing..."

1290
02:23:24,521 --> 02:23:31,486
"people kept dropping me"
