1
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,750
Be quiet for a minute. Keep your eyes closed.

2
00:01:14,292 --> 00:01:16,167
This is Shruthi, my wife.

3
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,708
It was problematic; we came out of home and got married.

4
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,708
Open your eyes slowly.

5
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:26,833
How's that?

6
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:29,458
- Come soon. - Yeah, coming.

7
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:49,500
Hey, give a smile now.

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,167
Just shut it down.

9
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,625
Hey maniac!

10
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,167
Won't you listen?

11
00:01:58,667 --> 00:01:59,750
Okay, have this.

12
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:04,833
If something happens to me in future, the sole reason...

13
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,792
...will be my wife. That's the reason this is being shot!

14
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:10,625
What to do? I've married her.

15
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:18,042
First kiss after marriage.

16
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,458
Isn't that very special?

17
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,292
We can never get back this moment.

18
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:25,375
That's why--

19
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,833
- Shiva! - Shruthi!

20
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:58,500
Suicide by newly married couple Shiva-Shruthi at a seashore farmhouse.

21
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,958
It's rumored that there's something supernatural about their suicide.

22
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:09,500
Such suicides are increasing in such farmhouses.

23
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:14,417
Is it their decision behind their suicide?

24
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:18,208
Or, is that because of the supernatural power in the farmhouses?

25
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,917
Here is a compilation of such farmhouses with supernatural powers.

26
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,958
- Mr. John Abraham. - Yes.

27
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,000
What would be the reason if you suicide?

28
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,833
I never get more than 5 likes for any of my photos on Facebook.

29
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,500
You no more have to live!

30
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,375
He'll definitely be committing suicide! Let's ask the reason.

31
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:48,625
I never get 6-packs how much ever I run!

32
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:51,375
- What's your take on suicide? - I already got married boss!

33
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,000
People ask me to turn on A/C in auto.

34
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:56,542
I'm pestered to reach school by 9 AM.

35
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:59,292
They ask me to stand surety!

36
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:03,167
No girl looks at me or falls in love!

37
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,958
I dialed my wife. She seems to have got connected to someone else!

38
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:16,375
I don't know whether these people will suicide...

39
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,333
...I will, for sure!

40
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:24,125
Do you know who launched a fans club for James Cameron?

41
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:27,500
It's me!

42
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,000
I desire to film such magnum-opus movies.

43
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:35,542
I ended up taking this movie without getting any opportunity!

44
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,125
Tamil cinema lost James Kumaran.

45
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:46,000
The whole world stands behind as reason for my death.

46
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:50,292
Oh God!

47
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,792
I never received these many likes even when I posted a pic with Sunny Leone.

48
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,958
You people have given these many likes when I told I'm about to die!

49
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,333
Where do you come from?

50
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,458
Mr. Kathir, what are you thinking so intensely?

51
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:10,542
Your mind may change if you think too much.

52
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,583
Be strong. We'll suicide today for sure.

53
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,542
Did you both get introduced to each other?

54
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,083
Nisha, meet my friend. Kathir, greet her.

55
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,750
We're at the verge of dying. Why should we greet?

56
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:29,958
Let's enjoy at least before we die.

57
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,292
We've decided to die as we aren't happy.

58
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:33,500
Exactly.

59
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,917
Why should we die if we're enjoying lives?

60
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:40,875
We lost all peace, happiness and joy!

61
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:44,667
The only knot is to suicide!

62
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,125
Why are you wasting time?

63
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,750
I feel like dying right at the moment thinking of that arrogant woman!

64
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,333
For all the problems I have, I should no more delay to die!

65
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,833
I should have got buried one month ago!

66
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,333
If something is getting delayed, it's definitely for some good reason.

67
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:04,917
If it had happened that day, you would have died in your home!

68
00:08:05,292 --> 00:08:06,292
But today?

69
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,458
I've booked a beach house for you.

70
00:08:08,542 --> 00:08:09,667
How's my plan?

71
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,458
Let each of us die in a room...

72
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:16,417
...roam there again as ghosts, and threaten every visitor!

73
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,292
Don't worry. We'll have our breakfast tomorrow with ghosts.

74
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,458
Okay, come, let's go for shopping.

75
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,500
What's the need to shop before dying?

76
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:27,583
How will you die? We need something for it, isn't it?

77
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
What are you all planning together?

78
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:44,000
We're planning for a tour to Kanyakumari, and buying the essentials.

79
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,417
There's nothing to hide. Give us your opinion.

80
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:48,417
Which of these will help us die soon?

81
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,250
Are you trying to involve me in this?

82
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:52,583
Wait, I'll be back.

83
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:17,542
Hey, stop it.

84
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,625
- Why are you behaving so indecent? - Come again?

85
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,875
We'll have someone to dance for our death only if we do the same to others.

86
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:25,875
And this is my last wish too!

87
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,583
Have you got any last wish in life?

88
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:31,500
I got one.

89
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,708
I need to go for a long drive before I die.

90
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:36,292
Sure.

91
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,708
I need to settle things with a fellow.

92
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:40,417
Let me do it.

93
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:41,750
Whom does he mean now?

94
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,875
You got chances of surviving if you fall down from second floor.

95
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:44,792
Welcome sir.

96
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,000
Welcome to Valet Parking sir. Please give your keys.

97
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:48,042
Get lost you useless fellow.

98
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:48,958
Hurry up dude.

99
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,875
I thought they'll get an Audi, it turned out to be a circus jeep!

100
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,750
Do you know who I'm? I ask this to the opposition party.

101
00:09:58,917 --> 00:10:00,917
I'll clean shave your head during the next election.

102
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,208
Here's my talk. Touch my party men and you'll feel the shock.

103
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:09,000
If you slap me on one side, I'll show you the other too.

104
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,125
Really?

105
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,875
Yes, I'm serious.

106
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,292
Why are you doing like this?

107
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,500
Bad donkey, small wall.

108
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,708
Bad donkey, small wall.

109

116

117

Look at him avoid me! How do I die?

153
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,958
Hey Kathir, it was very thrilling. Thank you!

154
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,625
Welcome to Food Village Valet Parking sir.

155
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:48,375
Hey, look there, thief!

156
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,083
Who are we then? Come on.

157
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,333
Leave it, the home is in close proximity.

158
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,750
- I'll freshen up and come. - Do that please.

159
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:59,750
What's her problem to commit suicide?

160
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,292
What could be the reason?

161
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:03,917
She might have loved a rogue.

162
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:06,375
He would have broke up with her.

163
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:09,750
- It's all in the game dude. - You spoiled my death.

164
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,458
I got myself hidden and fell in front of the car.

165
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:15,458
- That's a jeep. - You just went off.

166
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:19,417
- Boss. - Stop it.

167
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:21,500
I know what you'll tell.

168
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,625
You'll say committing suicide is cowardly.

169
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:28,333
Set aside your flaws, gain confidence and face the life!

170
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:29,208
Who said so?

171
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:30,917
We're here to commit suicide!

172
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,042
Welcome to death troop!

173
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,333
Your good name?

174
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:36,542
Adhisaya Raj.

175
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,583
- It doesn't match. - I know.

176
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:41,250
Leave that, may I know your reason to die?

177
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:46,042
A Malaysian flight went missing with 272 people...

178
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,042
...my heart went missing similarly!

179
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:52,708
- Who's this new tune? - What's he doing here?

180
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,292
You were the one who jumped in front of the jeep, isn't it?

181
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,083
Hi, I'm Adhisaya Raj from UK.

182
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:57,792
Move away and talk man.

183
00:14:58,042 --> 00:14:59,333
Jealous guy!

184
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:01,792
- What's UK? - Urayur Kuppam.

185
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:06,792
I desired to get married to my uncle's daughter right from childhood.

186
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,667
But she said she'll marry me only if I appear on TV.

187
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,917
I took lot of effort for it...

188
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,667
...but it never happened.

189
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,375
That's why I've decided to suicide.

190
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,375
Why have you got a camera around your neck?

191
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:21,500
Selfie bro.

192
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:26,333
She may find me on TV if my death gets recorded and is telecast in a channel.

193
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,667
That's enough for me.

194
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,542
That's enough.

195
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,625
- Don't you need Biryani? - Yes, I need.

196
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:37,417
Order a Chicken Biryani dude.

197
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,375
Biryani is too tasty.

198
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,542
You're eating for free. That should obviously taste good!

199
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:46,042
How and where are we going to die?

200
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,583
Nearby only!

201
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:08,625
We were happy till now.

202
00:16:10,292 --> 00:16:11,250
Now...

203
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,375
...we're going to die.

204
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:15,583
Why are you saying that sadly bro?

205
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:17,625
Say that happily, energetic!

206
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:18,708
We'll die happily.

207
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,375
Hey, bulldog is fast approaching.

208
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:23,375
Who are you?

209
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,625
Don't panic.

210
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,667
Your owner told to receive 3 guests, isn't it?

211
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,458
Yes.

212
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:33,125
- We're the guests. - You're 4 people. I won't let you in.

213
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,083
- Four? We're only three here. - Three?

214
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,250
Me, this girl and the guy.

215
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,333
Is someone else visible to your eyes?

216
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,417
Kathir, he has got some supernatural power.

217
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,583
Don't look at him for long time. You'll fall to death.

218
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:49,667
Yes, he looks scary.

219
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:54,833
I'll be visible only to your eyes.

220
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,708
This is not a usual home. This has supernatural powers inside.

221
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,583
Three people have died here so far.

222
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,792
A fellow drunk poison and died here.

223
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,000
A fellow cut his neck and died here.

224
00:17:52,042 --> 00:17:54,083
A fellow hung himself and died here.

225
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:57,542
That's why I tell you, it's not safe to stay here.

226
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,500
This is where a fellow had Paratha.

227
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:02,125
This is where he vomited the Paratha.

228
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,917
Get away man.

229
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,708
We play by dressing up ghosts.

230
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,333
Hey.

231
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,875
You will only hear my voice.

232
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:15,458
If you let them stay here tonight...

233
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:19,333
...this home will then be referred as Seven Spirits home.

234
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:20,667
Listen to me.

235
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,500
Who were you talking to?

236
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:24,417
Who were you talking to?

237
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:45,208
Hey, come on. You look darker than me!

238
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:46,583
Come on blacky.

239
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,625
What were you looking for?

240
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,083
Do you need a candle?

241
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:55,292
You made a beautiful move from the left to right. Extraordinary it was!

242
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,750
Awesome, excellent, spectacular!

243
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,875
Director has come. Fall at his feet and get his blessings.

244
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,042
He's about to make a movie by name 'Dash in the Dark'.

245
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:04,458
- Fall at his feet. - He's not a normal human.

246
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:05,583
He is supernatural.

247
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,542
He communicates only with ghosts.

248
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,125
Will he talk with ghosts?

249
00:19:10,042 --> 00:19:11,625
Are there ghosts here?

250
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:14,958
We'll get to know about it tonight. Let's see to it after we die.

251
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:20,250
All three seem to head from the same family.

252
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,375
This house is haunted!

253
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,458
Yes, this house is haunted!

254
00:19:25,542 --> 00:19:26,792
This corner has got a mat!

255
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,000
The roads have dogs and cats!

256
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,792
Look at his getup in a home where ladies roam.

257
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,333
You got cataract in your eyes. Did you check with a doctor?

258
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:36,458
Go.. go on!

259
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,917
You need to be near the gate. What are you doing here?

260
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,708
Go on.. go!

261
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,500
Narnias, blabbering something!

262
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:48,792
- Was he visible to your eyes? - Go!

263
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,292
<i>"The rose flower--"</i>

264
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,417
Did he get bitten by a dog?

265
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,875
You look like a Rhino wearing a gown!

266
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:44,125
I've been waiting to show you something. Are you ready for it?

267
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,333
Don't you come near me!

268
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:47,625
I'll show it just once. Have a look!

269
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,667
Your face itself is horrible to look at! Listen! No!

270
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,750
I need!

271
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,333
No don't.

272
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:54,958
No bro! Don't you come near me!

273
00:20:57,417 --> 00:20:59,833
My locks are curly!!

274
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:03,458
You nasty! Why do you wear this!

275
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,042
This is my Uncle's daughter!

276
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:06,458
She is a doctor!

277
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:09,333
- Are you the compounder? - No! I am a carpenter!

278
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:11,625
- I thought you rear donkeys! - Thank you.

279
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:16,583
If I wear this wig only then will Rosemary recognize me!

280
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:19,250
Suppose I die without the wig...

281
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,542
...and if she thinks that I am someone else...

282
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:21,708
...then my death would be of no use!

283
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,583
- It's disgusting! - Bye!

284
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:25,667
The lizard in the washroom is going to have a nightmare!

285
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,958
- Get lost! Don't you show your face! - "I fell in love."

286
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:40,125
Mayamma!

287
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:43,958
That house was our fortress all these days!

288
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:47,167
The friend's of that owner is spoiling our peace!

289
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:50,375
Since our owner was abroad, we were able to enjoy all the facilities!

290
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,833
Looks like these guys will stay here for long!

291
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,042
How many of them?

292
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,250
- 4 of them. - No. No. 3 of them.

293
00:21:56,458 --> 00:22:00,042
I am not bothered if there are 4 of them or 3 of them!

294
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:03,792
Only Mangala can send them out of that house!

295
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:07,792
Mangala should come here! She should come to this bungalow!

296
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,042
Things are happening according to our plan.

297
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:22,667
Don't call me very often.

298
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,292
These people may start doubting.

299
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:30,167
- Oh my God! - Who were you talking to?

300
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:33,875
Nothing bro! It was a producer.

301
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:35,333
The dates of Powerstar is available it seems.

302
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:37,083
He asked me if I would be interested in making a movie with him as the lead.

303
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:40,000
Sorry. I replied that I would rather suicide than take that decision.

304
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:48,708
Why are you always have a sober face?

305
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:51,583
How about yours?

306
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,708
Looks as though you've lost something big!

307
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:55,875
He looks like this only now!

308
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,458
Leave it!

309
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,000
She will not understand!

310
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,167
All girls are the same!

311
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:03,625
What have you learnt about all girls?

312
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,042
<i>"He's spectacular."</i>

313
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,833
<i>"There's none better than him."</i>

314
00:23:19,917 --> 00:23:24,542
<i>"He can beat anybody. He's at another level altogether."</i>

315
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:27,125
<i>"There's none to stop his progress."</i>

316
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:29,583
<i>"He's at nobody's mercy."</i>

317
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:31,875
<i>"He's too busy to work for anybody."</i>

318
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:34,708
<i>"There's no law against it, it's all fair."</i>

319
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,292
<i>"C'mon, beat it!"</i>

320
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:45,292
Bro! Now a girl will sing! It'll be awesome!

321
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:49,250
Sing!

322
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:54,750
<i>"Oh baby, like fresh snow flakes, you're my dearest..."</i>

323
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,292
She shouts like a sales girl instead of singing!

324
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:57,792
<i>"...you're the star--"</i>

325
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:59,708
Is this called singing?

326
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:02,583
Calm down bro. She has got cold!

327
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:04,125
You leave now!

328
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:07,042
Will at least this girl sing?

329
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,458
Just watch!

330
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,583
<i>"Oh dummie darling."</i>

331
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:16,208
Get lost!

332
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,000
In the name of singing, if you're going to bring someone--

333
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,292
Wait bro! Give me a final chance.

334
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:24,583
Please. I beg you! I've trained her a lot.

335
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:27,208
Hey! Come on and sing now!

336
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,958
<i>"Oh beloved..."</i>

337
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:35,375
<i>"...when I sight sight upon you."</i>

338
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:36,833
Who is she?

339
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
- I don't know. - Her singing is awesome.

340
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,167
It was on that day that I saw Swathi for the first time.

341
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,917
I fell in love with her instantly!

342
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,417
All my love was only for my guitar...

343
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:51,500
...until I saw her.

344
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:32,917
<i>"Your presence brings beauty to the sky."</i>

345
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:37,250
<i>"Much more than the moon's."</i>

346
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:43,458
<i>"Your fragrance brings peace to the earth."</i>

347
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:47,917
<i>"Much more than the flowers."</i>

348
00:25:48,458 --> 00:25:53,500
<i>"The moment I saw you."</i>

349
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:58,792
<i>"The moment your thoughts filled my heart."</i>

350
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:04,083
<i>"The moment you went away."</i>

351
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:09,708
<i>"The moment you passed my life."</i>

352
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:36,750

356
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:56,083
I joined this college just for you.

357
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:01,708
I was behind you like anything.

358
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,500
I've been there in each of your concerts.

359
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:14,667
Your song seemed it was sung just for me!

360
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:16,958
I like you so much!

00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:10,792

373
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:23,792
Are you in love with Swathi?

374
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:26,083
Yes, so what?

375
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:29,625
- That ain't for good dude. - I don't get you!

376
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:31,000
She's a pimp.

377
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:34,000
Never ever utter a word about her anymore!

378
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,875
You know her well. She means everything to me!

379
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:40,250
She's a very nice woman!

380
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,083
Who's that?

386
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:26,250
<i>"Where are you?"</i>

387
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:31,333
<i>"Those words that your uttered in my ears."</i>

388
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:36,292
<i>"Shall pass my life time."</i>

389
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:41,417

00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:46,833

392
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:57,708
<i>"The moment you passed my life."</i>

393
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:26,167
Come let's jump together!

394
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,458
Why do you want to jump?

395
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:37,167
I've been with her for the past 4 years! What Ashok said has come true!

396
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,583
Even I was thinking of this decision.

397
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:43,583
I dreamt of becoming a successful director.

398
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:46,625
It will only remain as a dream!

399
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:49,500
I can't take up any other job.

400
00:30:50,167 --> 00:30:51,625
You know very well about the state of my house!

401
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:53,500
I don't wish to be a burden to them!

402
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:57,042
All along my life, I've been happy only when I am with you!

403
00:30:58,333 --> 00:30:59,292
Please!

404
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:03,833
At least for me! Let's be happy for a few days and then take this decision!

405
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:06,042
If you are not interested, let's jump now!

406
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,625
Bro! Just think.

407
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:16,167
This was what happened!

408
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:17,500
Now you tell me.

409
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,167
Me and my sister were brought up in the same orphanage.

410
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:26,542
When I was in school.

411
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:29,583
My sister was in a live in relationship with a guy.

412
00:31:30,583 --> 00:31:32,542
I was completely against it.

413
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:39,917
She and that guy stole something from their owner and went absconding.

414
00:31:42,292 --> 00:31:44,375
The owner came to know that it was they who stole.

415
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:49,208
He came in search of me and held me responsible.

416
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:53,333
He asked me either to give back the stolen thing or...

417
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:57,167
...to sleep with him!

418
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:02,583
I decided to end my life.

419
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,167
What will she do for the mistake that her sister and that guy committed?

420
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:15,042
Why are you asking me about this? Ask her!

421
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:16,792
She is a small girl!

422
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:19,125
What will she know?

423
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:21,875
We should only advise and make her understand!

424
00:32:22,042 --> 00:32:24,458
If I tell her not to end you life...

425
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:28,000
...will she say, "Okay Kumaran! Thanks for saving my life!"

426
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:28,917
Leave her!

427
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,750
I am now telling you not to end your life!

428
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:32,417
Will you listen? No isn't it?

429
00:32:34,542 --> 00:32:37,458
Since you insist we can do one thing.

430
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:39,500
Let's postpone our suicide plan by 3 days.

431
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,667
Let's brain wash her and send her home!

432
00:32:42,958 --> 00:32:45,333
And then we can happily die! What say?

433
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,958
No no! I can't wait for three days!

434
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:49,125
No way!

435
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:53,667
You only said that she is small girl! Sweet girl!

436
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,583
She will be alone after we die!

437
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:57,417
What if she does something after that?

438
00:32:57,833 --> 00:33:00,375
Take a closer look at her face!

439
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:04,875
Hey bro! She is crying!

440
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,583
Go and console her first!

441
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,417
Postpone the plan by 3 days or else she will also undergo postmortem!

442
00:33:23,625 --> 00:33:24,500
Nisha

443
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:37,500
Oh my God! Fantastic!

444
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:39,292
Hats off to you! Hats off!

445
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:41,292
It's Nisha!

446
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:44,542
Whose story was it darling?

447
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:47,042
Didn't you watch the movie Pizza?

448
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:48,750
Oh yes!

449
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:51,167
That's why it sounded very familiar!

450
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,000
Super!

451
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:57,542
Leave that! Did he accept to postpone the suicide plan by 3 days?

452
00:33:58,208 --> 00:33:59,208
Won't I make him do it!

453
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:01,125
I have made him accept that!

454
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:02,958
He is looking here!

455
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:05,542
Change your face and modulation!

456
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:11,333
I can't control my feelings any more!

457
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:15,542
It's too much! Try to control it. He might find out!

458
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:20,875
I want to tell him that I love him!

459
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:28,083
I have lied to my dad that I am going on excursion!

460
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:30,625
If I don't go back in 3 days...

461
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,875
...my dad is gonna thrash me!

462
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:36,667
Please brother!

463
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:40,333
Oh my! he is constantly looking here. Please continue your performance!

464
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:43,458
I've completed my performance!

465
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:46,083
How was the biriyani that we had for lunch?

466
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,292
Oh, the Biryani was so horrible!

467
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:55,167
Please order Pizza and mutton gravy for dinner.

468
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:58,292
That is an awful combination.

469
00:34:58,375 --> 00:35:02,250
To have that one can rather have poison!

470
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:06,625
If I stay any longer, I might start laughing.

471
00:35:07,042 --> 00:35:08,292
I am leaving.

472
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:09,875
Brother!

473
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:13,458
Please order a Pepsi along with that.

474
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:16,708
Mutton gravy, Pizza and Pepsi!!

475
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:18,667
I am leaving!

476
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:21,083
Did she agree to postpone by 3 days?

477
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:25,208
No.. At first she didn't agree...

478
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:26,708
...she then suddenly agreed!

479
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,958
She told me a reason for that which shocked me.

480
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:32,167
What did she say?

481
00:35:32,792 --> 00:35:34,708
She can't agree for me it seems!

482
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:37,125
She agreed to postpone for you it seems!

483
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:39,500
Why would she do that for me?

484
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:42,875
Small girl. She has some feeling for you! Leave it bro!

485
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:44,083
Stop kidding!

486
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,000
I am serious!

487
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:48,458
She heard your story and developed some feelings for you!

488
00:35:48,542 --> 00:35:50,875
Just 3 more days! Anyway we are going to die.

489
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,250
Let's save at least the girls life.

490
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:54,417
Whatever it is--

491
00:35:54,708 --> 00:35:57,250
Just 3 more days and I can't wait after that!

492
00:35:57,708 --> 00:35:59,583
Talk something and send her back!

493
00:36:00,042 --> 00:36:03,125
You go bro! Don't worry about anything...

494
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:06,750
...sleep well.. I'll take care of everything.. get going, buddy.

495
00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:09,042
<i>"I'm shocked."</i>

496
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,167
Oh my God!

497
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:12,417
<i>"I'm shocked."</i>

498
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,458
Would he have overheard?

499
00:36:15,458 --> 00:36:16,667
Shocked?

500
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,500
I heard everything!

501
00:36:19,542 --> 00:36:20,500
Why?

502
00:36:20,917 --> 00:36:23,667
You want to sell off my curvy body?

503
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,417
It's not a curvy body! But a horrible one!

504
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:28,125
No one would be interested.

505
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,333
Enough of kidding. When are we going to die?

506
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:33,875
We are gonna die after 3 days.

507
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:35,875
You die whenever you want.

508
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,208
Is it confirmed after 3 days?

509
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:39,750
Confirm!

510
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:41,417
If we don't die.

511
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,708
We will surely poison and kill you!

512
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:45,125
Take your hands off me!

513
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,875
I didn't understand! I told you to take your hands off in Tamil!

514
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,000
Thank you.

515
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:32,333
Dude.

516
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,417
Are you so affectionate on me?

517
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:35,958
Give that.

518
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:37,292
This is for Nisha.

519
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:39,292
Go give it to her!

520
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:42,708
That's ridiculous James Kumara!

521
00:37:43,833 --> 00:37:45,167
I doubted this yesterday.

522
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:47,500
You get depressed looking her crying.

523
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:49,708
Do I look like a waiter?

524
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,250
Give that yourself.

525
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:53,333
Trying to make use of us!

526
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:54,542
Go!

527
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:04,333
Kathir has fallen in love!

528
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:07,833
<i>"Where's the party now?"</i>

529
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:12,250
<i>"Where's the party now?"</i>

530
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:39,542
<i>"The heart is suddenly full of emotions."</i>

531
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:43,625
<i>"My outlook is changing."</i>

532
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:47,583
<i>"The heart feels broken."</i>

533
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:51,042
<i>"And feels shattered when you are closer."</i>

534
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:55,375
<i>"My heart is having massive tremors."</i>

535
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:59,833
<i>"Only because of you."</i>

536
00:38:59,917 --> 00:39:03,333
<i>"Where's the party.. where's the party?"</i>

537
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:07,750
<i>"Where's the party.. where's the party now?"</i>

538
00:39:07,917 --> 00:39:11,333
<i>"Where's the party.. where's the party?"</i>

539
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:15,792
<i>"Where's the party.. where's the party now?"</i>

540
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:17,792
<i>"Right now, right here with you."</i>

541
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:19,792
<i>"Right now, right here with you."</i>

542
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:21,833
<i>"Right now, right here with you."</i>

543
00:39:21,917 --> 00:39:24,000
<i>"Right now, right here with you."</i>

544
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:35,250
<i>"Your smile, your walk."</i>

545
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:39,292
<i>"Does something within me."</i>

546
00:39:39,792 --> 00:39:43,625
<i>"There is an electric moment."</i>

547
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:48,083
<i>"that connects my heart and eyes."</i>

548
00:39:48,167 --> 00:39:51,792
<i>"The love fires up my very existence."</i>

549
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:55,750
<i>"And I seem to wander the world in joy."</i>

550
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:59,792
<i>"I became a ball in a kid's hand."</i>

551
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:04,208
<i>"I flew over the entire sky."</i>

552
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:15,667
<i>"The heart is suddenly full of emotions."</i>

553
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:20,292
<i>"My outlook is changing."</i>

554
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:39,625
<i>"There is love in one eye."</i>

555
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:43,375
<i>"And pain in the other."</i>

556
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:47,625
<i>"Your lies soothed me many time."</i>

557
00:40:47,792 --> 00:40:51,542
<i>"Your truth about love elated me every time."</i>

558
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:55,833
<i>"I ride the chariot of happiness. My heart jumps in excitement."</i>

559
00:40:56,042 --> 00:41:00,042
<i>"The moment you made me realize your love for me."</i>

560
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:03,708
<i>"I realized the sweetness of tears..."</i>

561
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:07,292
<i>"...though your love."</i>

562
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:19,375
<i>"Where's the party? Where's the party?"</i>

563
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:23,792
<i>"Where's the party? Where's the party now?"</i>

564
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:27,792
<i>"Where's the party? Where's the party?"</i>

565
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:31,708
<i>"Where's the party? Where's the party now?"</i>

566
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:52,958
You said you'll change her in 3 days, but you seem to have got changed!

567
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,958
Is it love, if she moves close to you?

568
00:41:56,958 --> 00:41:58,750
Is your character so weak?

569
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:04,250
Wouldn't she think badly if she comes to know of your desires?

570
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:07,792
Are you trying to impress her by making coffee for her?

571
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:09,458
You insane fellow!

572
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:12,792
Stick on to your decision firmly!

573
00:42:13,917 --> 00:42:15,958
Go and get on with what you came for!

574
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:40,875
What's causing this smoke?

575
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:45,750
Hey, this fellow is burnt to death!

576
00:42:47,917 --> 00:42:49,917
They have made his portrait so soon!

577
00:43:00,042 --> 00:43:00,958
What's he doing?

578
00:43:01,042 --> 00:43:04,375
Lord of this wide-spread world!

579
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:07,833
Lord of this one-of-a-kind planet!

580
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,167
Please come!

581
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:13,417
The one with your love, your brain, your beauty...

582
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,458
...look at the son of your miracle - Adhisayam!

583
00:43:17,542 --> 00:43:22,167
Now, I, Kumaran, Kathir, and the girl wearing mini-skirt...

584
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:28,958
...are coming to you to get rid of all sins, and bow at your feet!

585
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:32,042
During their travel time to reach you...

586
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:35,750
...get them an advance seat by a window side!

587
00:43:35,833 --> 00:43:37,958
I shall discuss with the travels owner!

588
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:39,958
They're cowards.

589
00:43:40,042 --> 00:43:42,625
They get scared for even silly things.

590
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:45,792
They're scared of death My Father!

591
00:43:45,875 --> 00:43:50,333
Pave way for them to die sweet and neat!

592
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,250
Come on lord!

593
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:57,708
Come on lord! Give it to me lord!

594
00:43:57,792 --> 00:43:59,250
Give me a lot lord!

595
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:01,083
He has sprayed mosquito repellent everywhere!

596
00:44:01,167 --> 00:44:02,292
Come on lord! Give it to me lord!

597
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:03,375
Idiot!

598
00:44:03,792 --> 00:44:05,750
If you're praying, pray only for your death!

599
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:07,583
Why are you praying for ours too?

600
00:44:08,042 --> 00:44:11,000
No way! We came together and we will die together!

601
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:13,083
We can't die along with you.

602
00:44:13,167 --> 00:44:17,333
Are you kidding? It was you people who said we shall die in 3 days.

603
00:44:17,417 --> 00:44:18,833
Are we not dying today?

604
00:44:18,917 --> 00:44:22,208
No matter who commits suicide with you, I will, for sure!

605
00:44:22,708 --> 00:44:23,792
That's the spirit.

606
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:27,417
- You're a gentleman! - Adhisayam, don't trust anyone here.

607
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,375
They've been cheating us saying they're going to die.

608
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:35,458
No matter who dies, we both shall die together. Get ready!

609
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:38,042
That's the spirit! You're a gentlewoman!

610
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:42,875
I believed something would turn up in these 3 days.

611
00:44:43,875 --> 00:44:45,292
Nothing worked out!

612
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:48,917
I have no hopes that he'll propose his love for me.

613
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:52,375
I can't live without Kathir.

614
00:44:54,042 --> 00:44:55,750
I'll also die with him!

615
00:44:56,083 --> 00:44:57,083
What! You're gonna die!

616
00:44:57,708 --> 00:44:59,208
Is this what we've been struggling for?

617
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:00,625
We could've died that day itself.

618
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:03,875
I need to manage her in addition to him!

619
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:09,208
Look, we managed all these days.

620
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:12,292
I believe everything will get changed tonight.

621
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:16,792
Whether you trust yourself or not, trust your love for Kathir.

622
00:45:57,667 --> 00:45:59,667
Mangalaa is coming Mayamma!

623
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:00,667
When?

624
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:01,792
Today is a full-moon day.

625
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:05,542
Mangalaa will come today to send them out of the bungalow.

626
00:46:05,792 --> 00:46:06,833
Mangalaa is coming.

627
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,083
My beloved suiciders!

628
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,417
Today's blessings, and tomorrow's corpses!

629
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:26,375
Pick one of the weapons bought by Adhisaya Raj for you!

630
00:46:26,458 --> 00:46:27,958
Please take this.

631
00:46:28,292 --> 00:46:29,667
Please take this.

632
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:31,375
Please take this.

633
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:34,625
- Why is the knife rusted? - Even you look rusted!

634
00:46:35,208 --> 00:46:38,750
There are chances of surviving if you kill yourself with a new knife.

635
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:40,958
But if you cut yourself using a rusted one...

636
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:43,292
...you'll die for sure at least by getting septic.

637
00:46:43,375 --> 00:46:46,042
Now, the clock is left with 15 minutes to hit 12.

638
00:46:46,208 --> 00:46:49,875
When it hits 12, it will produce 12 banging noise!

639
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:52,500
For each and every bang, one of us should die!

640
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:54,667
Stab yourself with whatever you get and fall dead!

641
00:46:54,917 --> 00:46:56,958
Backpack and leave this world!

642
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,500
Why are you torturing me?

643
00:46:58,708 --> 00:47:00,125
Oh god, he's killing me with his talks!

644
00:47:00,917 --> 00:47:04,833
Okay guys, let's take the suicide selfie. Come on.

645
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:09,042
Okay, thank you.

646
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:10,333
Need to upload on Facebook.

647
00:47:10,417 --> 00:47:12,583
Everyone should cut at a time. All the best.

648
00:47:12,792 --> 00:47:14,292
- Give me five! - Get lost!

649
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:17,333
No five? Okay.

650
00:47:17,542 --> 00:47:20,667
<i>"Five.. five.. five.. all things five."</i>

651
00:47:20,958 --> 00:47:24,000
<i>"I slit my hand with knives."</i>

652
00:47:39,042 --> 00:47:41,333
Stick on to your decision firmly!

653
00:47:41,667 --> 00:47:44,875
I got no more hopes that he'll propose his love.

654
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,958
They're going to die in just 5 minutes!

655
00:48:29,042 --> 00:48:33,333
I should somehow stop it! Think something Kumara!

656
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:37,792
<i>"Look at me, Oh dear."</i>

657
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:40,917
<i>"Hold my hands, Oh dear."</i>

658
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,750
<i>"Look at me, Oh dear."</i>

659
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:44,833
I got an idea!

660
00:48:45,375 --> 00:48:47,833
Great! Let me see how you are gonna die!

661
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:54,750
You idiot, what are you doing?

662
00:48:55,292 --> 00:48:56,292
Have you gone mad?

663
00:48:56,917 --> 00:48:59,667
What if you die? Will Kathir love you?

664
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:04,333
I have no other way to prove my love.

665
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:06,750
You have!

666
00:49:06,917 --> 00:49:08,000
You have yet another chance.

667
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:09,417
That's a very simple matter.

668
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:11,292
What matter is it?

669
00:49:12,708 --> 00:49:14,042
Matter is the matter!

670
00:49:14,958 --> 00:49:15,958
I don't get you?

671
00:49:16,042 --> 00:49:19,042
Spend 15 minutes with Kathir just like--

672
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:21,208
- 15 minutes? - Give him a hug and kiss!

673
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,708
Oh god, no, I can't!

674
00:49:24,042 --> 00:49:26,542
- What will he think about me? - He wouldn't think anything.

675
00:49:26,792 --> 00:49:29,083
One man can only understand another man's feel.

676
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:31,958
One man can only understand another man's feel.

677
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:33,750
What's your point?

678
00:49:34,083 --> 00:49:35,917
A male would never forget his first sip of liquor...

679
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:39,000
...and his very first intercourse.

680
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:40,125
So now what you need to do is--

681
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:42,042
You first told me to kiss, but you're saying something else now!

682
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:43,875
No, only kiss.

683
00:49:43,958 --> 00:49:46,083
I know Kathir very well.

684
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:50,167
He's too good. He wouldn't even look at an item number.

685
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:52,583
If you kiss him...

686
00:49:52,917 --> 00:49:57,792
...he wouldn't suicide out of guilty feel that he kissed a virgin girl.

687
00:49:57,958 --> 00:50:00,875
Anybody would feel guilty for this issue, even a saint!

688
00:50:00,958 --> 00:50:03,667
Even more important thing to note is...

689
00:50:05,417 --> 00:50:10,625
...I got no other idea, please, I'm ready to fall at your feet, please help me!

690
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:13,833
I'm okay if it's just kissing.

691
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,708
Super, get fixed to it. I'll send him in 10 minutes. Be prepared.

692
00:50:19,333 --> 00:50:20,250
Come again?

693
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:32,125
Hey, is Nisha dead?

694
00:50:34,292 --> 00:50:36,333
- Tell me. - Leave it man!

695
00:50:36,542 --> 00:50:37,958
She's asking the same question.

696
00:50:39,042 --> 00:50:41,042
How do you have such a great chemistry working between you two?

697
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:43,250
What are you blabbering? Come to the point!

698
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:45,625
She's calling you for the same too.

699
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:48,958
Be clear. Don't irritate me. It's getting late. I need to die.

700
00:50:49,042 --> 00:50:51,000
No one stopped you from dying.

701
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:53,458
There's a small task before you die.

702
00:50:53,667 --> 00:50:55,125
Finish it off and die.

703
00:50:57,167 --> 00:50:58,917
What do you want now?

704
00:50:59,333 --> 00:51:00,542
I don't need anything...

705
00:51:01,042 --> 00:51:03,792
...you need to hug Nisha and kiss her!

706
00:51:04,042 --> 00:51:05,958
Just gently!

707
00:51:06,167 --> 00:51:08,375
What's your point? Have you gone insane?

708
00:51:08,708 --> 00:51:10,083
You seem to have gone mad.

709
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:13,500
Boss, I haven't gone mad, it's Nisha.

710
00:51:13,792 --> 00:51:15,917
Nisha has never been in love in her life...

711
00:51:16,208 --> 00:51:18,292
...so, obviously she wouldn't have had any boyfriend...

712
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:20,250
...she wouldn't have got kissed by anyone too!

713
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:24,958
She might have thought to get such desires fulfilled by you.

714
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:26,667
There's nothing wrong in it.

715
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:30,458
It's just a kiss. Just give man!

716
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:35,125
Let me know if you aren't interested. I'll tell her.

717
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:39,083
Why don't you kiss her before dying?

718
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:41,333
I've never seen her that way.

719
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,500
See so now!

720
00:51:45,292 --> 00:51:47,958
I find something wrong in it!

721
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,833
I can't believe it even now that...

722
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:54,083
...Nisha asked this.

723
00:51:55,125 --> 00:51:56,458
Kumaran.

724
00:51:57,417 --> 00:52:00,708
I have no time. I need to die. Ask him if he's okay with it.

725
00:52:01,917 --> 00:52:04,583
I can't wait. I got just 2 minutes.

726
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:07,500
No Nisha, I'm in talks with him. I'll finalize soon.

727
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,208
Damn it! Such a shameful act!

728
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:11,667
Dude, agree to it. It's just a single kiss!

729
00:52:12,125 --> 00:52:13,417
Hey, she's my friend!

730
00:52:13,625 --> 00:52:14,958
How can I kiss a friend?

731
00:52:15,208 --> 00:52:18,042
Kissing a friend is now the trend!

732
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:19,125
Please agree.

733
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:21,917
Just kiss her. She'll take care of the rest!

734
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:23,208
Is it okay?

735
00:52:23,292 --> 00:52:26,083
It's getting late. Is it okay or not?

736
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:28,167
Why are you in such a hurry?

737
00:52:28,917 --> 00:52:32,917
She's asking so frankly despite being a woman. What's it for you man? Agree!

738
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:37,292
Yes, he agreed to it. Go and get ready. I'll send him in 2 minutes.

739
00:52:37,583 --> 00:52:38,708
I'll wait only for 5 minutes.

740
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:42,333
Please agree dude!

741
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,042
Okay dude. Just a kiss, isn't it?

742
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:46,375
I'll kiss her and come.

743
00:52:46,583 --> 00:52:48,167
It's getting late to die.

744
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,500
Why are you heading as if it's a war?

745
00:52:51,708 --> 00:52:53,417
Get freshened up, dress up neatly...

746
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,958
...smell fresh and go.

747
00:52:57,292 --> 00:52:59,375
Only then you'll enjoy the kiss.

748
00:52:59,792 --> 00:53:00,792
Get away!

749
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:05,625
I think the plaited fellow is dead. Come on.

750
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:21,417
I knew for sure that you both wouldn't die.

751
00:53:23,708 --> 00:53:24,917
Where's that girl?

752
00:53:25,667 --> 00:53:27,083
Have you killed her?

753
00:53:27,375 --> 00:53:28,625
You killed her and buried?

754
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:32,333
I wouldn't leave without taking revenge on you two!

755
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:35,542
Set that aside. First get a brush to clean your teeth.

756
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:38,208
That smells intolerable, go away!

757
00:53:38,375 --> 00:53:39,542
Dude, get ready.

758
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,500
<i>"My path is blurred."</i>

759
00:53:58,542 --> 00:54:03,500
<i>"My soul is sleepless."</i>

760
00:54:03,667 --> 00:54:08,542
<i>"My existence seems like a mirage."</i>

761
00:54:08,583 --> 00:54:13,292
<i>"Your tears gave me my life."</i>

762
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:18,375
<i>"My heart blossomed with your touch."</i>

763
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:23,292
<i>"I realized the reason for my existence."</i>

764
00:54:23,708 --> 00:54:28,625
<i>"I realized your desire for me."</i>

765
00:54:28,792 --> 00:54:33,583
<i>"I got open to my manliness!"</i>

766
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:38,583
<i>"I thought previous lives are lies..."</i>

767
00:54:38,667 --> 00:54:43,125
<i>"...until I saw you."</i>

768
00:54:43,875 --> 00:54:48,792
<i>"The face and body will perish by time."</i>

769
00:54:48,875 --> 00:54:53,375
<i>"The love in your heart is eternal."</i>

770
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:00,333
Nisha.

771
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:18,333
Nisha.

772
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:31,500
Hey!

773
00:57:33,167 --> 00:57:35,833
Is a woman's body shit?

774
00:57:37,292 --> 00:57:39,542
Try touching her again...

775
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:42,333
...I'll cut open your throat!

776
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,875
Is that fun to play with a woman's body?

777
00:57:49,667 --> 00:57:52,250
I'll never let you touch her.

778
00:57:53,417 --> 00:57:54,708
Get lost!

779
00:57:55,167 --> 00:57:56,708
Get out!

780
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:03,458
Kathir!

781
00:58:11,375 --> 00:58:15,208
Are you trying to escape after finishing everything?

782
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:30,667
2 minutes. I'll get freshen up and come.

783
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:40,083
You're going to die at my hands!

784
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Look at how he has toiled!

785
00:59:02,417 --> 00:59:03,875
Hard work never fails.

786
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:11,875
I'm scanning through almanacs to separate them...

787
00:59:12,208 --> 00:59:16,333
...and you are trying to hook them up you fool.

788
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:20,125
This was the movie you were talking about is it?

789
00:59:20,208 --> 00:59:21,250
Listen to me first.

790
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:23,167
I haven't come here to suicide.

791
00:59:23,583 --> 00:59:24,917
I'm here to patch them up.

792
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:27,083
Then why the hell did you bring me here.

793
00:59:27,167 --> 00:59:29,625
You dumb ass if I had left you, you wouldn't be alive now.

794
00:59:29,708 --> 00:59:32,750
If you cooperate with me I will patch up Rosemary with you.

795
00:59:35,667 --> 00:59:37,333
- This is your job is it? - Exactly.

796
00:59:37,375 --> 00:59:38,833
Alright, come. Hey!

797
00:59:39,833 --> 00:59:41,750
Will you keep up the promise you have made to me now?

798
00:59:41,833 --> 00:59:43,250
- Promise! - On yourself?

799
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:45,292
I swear on your wig! Now just come.

800
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:49,417
<i>"Cheers to love!"</i>

801
00:59:50,208 --> 00:59:51,917
<i>"Cheers to love!"</i>

802
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,333
Don't poke my eyes.

803
00:59:58,417 --> 01:00:00,292
Dude, so when shall we die.

804
01:00:00,542 --> 01:00:02,792
I don't want to die! Just get lost!

805
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:06,250
I know, I know.

806
01:00:06,583 --> 01:00:08,875
Once we decide to take the bat for playing cricket.

807
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,167
Then you'll get obsessed playing it everyday.

808
01:00:10,375 --> 01:00:11,750
Hey, then when is the match for me?

809
01:00:11,833 --> 01:00:13,833
We don't include aged people for the match.

810
01:00:14,083 --> 01:00:15,667
Sachin and myself belong to the same batch.

811
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:18,625
Why are you getting tensed dude, I'll telecast your match.

812
01:00:18,708 --> 01:00:21,208
But, It will have to be telecast in animal planet.

813
01:00:21,292 --> 01:00:24,417
- Will they surely telecast? - Sure, its 12:30 show every night.

814
01:00:24,667 --> 01:00:26,292
- Yea, laugh you shameless fellow. - Thank you.

815
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:27,208
Okay.

816
01:00:27,292 --> 01:00:28,583
Kathir.

817
01:00:34,083 --> 01:00:34,958
Kathir.

818
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:40,375
Why is she sounding so seductive?

819
01:00:40,958 --> 01:00:43,292
Not just her sound, even her approach seems to be so.

820
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:49,417
- Why is she wearing such long shorts!! - Kathir baby.

821
01:00:50,458 --> 01:00:52,500
Why are you sitting with these pigs?

822
01:00:53,958 --> 01:00:57,458
We are not pigs, you guys were busy doing something inside.

823
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,417
Kathir.

824
01:01:00,167 --> 01:01:01,583
Why did you leave without telling me?

825
01:01:01,833 --> 01:01:03,000
What? Did he just walk away?

826
01:01:03,208 --> 01:01:04,667
What? He got out halfway?

827
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:08,458
Oh, so that's why she is so seductive!

828
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:16,750
Dude, I'm getting back to my room.

829
01:01:17,333 --> 01:01:18,458
Hey! Stay back!

830
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:23,292
He was alright, what happened to him all of a sudden?

831
01:01:25,708 --> 01:01:28,917
<i>"Chicks at the disco."</i>

832
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:37,958
Hey!

833
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,625
- Come! - Leave me.

834
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,333
Don't splash it on my face.

835
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:01,875
Kathir, stop.

836
01:02:02,042 --> 01:02:04,625
Look at the chemistry they share.

837
01:02:05,125 --> 01:02:06,292
What's your opinion about it?

838
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:07,917
Who's that babe?

839
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,583
I thought only you were the pimp.

840
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:11,875
Now, I understand that you come from a generation of pimps!

841
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:16,000
Who is that?

842
01:02:16,208 --> 01:02:16,958
Leave me!

843
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:19,125
- Come here bro. - He is calling you, go.

844
01:02:19,208 --> 01:02:21,208
Come here, bro.

845
01:02:22,708 --> 01:02:25,583
- What is it? - Run away from this house bro!

846
01:02:26,167 --> 01:02:27,583
Why should we go?

847
01:02:27,708 --> 01:02:29,208
Are you planning to bring some chicks?

848
01:02:29,292 --> 01:02:30,667
- You seem to have changed your looks! - No.

849
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:32,833
Bro, This is my original style.

850
01:02:32,917 --> 01:02:35,333
My previous get up was to send you guys out of this house.

851
01:02:35,958 --> 01:02:39,917
Since that didn't work out your trying this now, is it?

852
01:02:40,125 --> 01:02:42,000
There is a ghost amongst you! Trust me!

853
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:44,708
We only have a Godzilla with us.

854
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,458
- I don't find any spirits. - Stop kidding! There is a ghost!

855
01:02:49,042 --> 01:02:50,042
Who's it?

856
01:02:54,833 --> 01:02:55,958
Hey Kathir!

857
01:02:57,417 --> 01:03:01,167
Nobody freaked out seeing me, but they should surely freak out seeing her.

858
01:03:01,208 --> 01:03:04,792
We hired a low paid actor for a heavy rate...

859
01:03:04,875 --> 01:03:06,417
...to chase all of you out of this house.

860
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,792
You fool, do you want me to apply the make up or not?

861
01:03:08,875 --> 01:03:09,667
Okay.

862
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:12,417
Come soon, The effects are fading.

863
01:03:12,583 --> 01:03:15,458
Reduce the smoke. My eyes are burning.

864
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:20,917
If you do well in this, we'll pair as the lead couple for my friend's next movie.

865
01:03:21,125 --> 01:03:21,958
- Okay? - Yes.

866
01:03:22,042 --> 01:03:24,625
- I hope you'll pay me properly. - First, act properly.

867
01:03:31,042 --> 01:03:34,875
She looks like a gentlewoman! But she freaks us out! Run, Mangala! Run!

868
01:03:37,125 --> 01:03:38,708
What a narrator you are!!

869
01:03:39,167 --> 01:03:41,958
Cheers! This was the kind of scene I wanted for my film.

870
01:03:42,167 --> 01:03:45,000
I'm not narrating any story here.

871
01:03:45,167 --> 01:03:46,542
Calm down! I trust you!

872
01:03:46,625 --> 01:03:49,792
- You know this girl named Mangala? - Yes.

873
01:03:49,875 --> 01:03:51,917
- Give me her number. - Get lost.

874
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,583
Unless I prove all this, you are not going to trust me.

875
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:56,583
- Wait and watch I'll prove it one day! - I trust you, give me her number?

876
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:57,792
Nisha.

877
01:03:59,042 --> 01:04:01,125
Karuppu says you are a ghost.

878
01:04:01,625 --> 01:04:02,542
Me!

879
01:04:07,292 --> 01:04:10,042
Yes, I'm the ghost.

880
01:04:41,083 --> 01:04:43,042
What are you doing here all alone?

881
01:04:43,292 --> 01:04:44,958
Come Nisha has cooked for us. Let's go!

882
01:04:45,542 --> 01:04:49,167
I am not coming. Don't call me. I'll stay here!

883
01:04:49,917 --> 01:04:52,625
I'm going to pack off from here tomorrow morning.

884
01:04:53,125 --> 01:04:55,792
You can come with me or stay back here and die!

885
01:04:56,208 --> 01:04:57,500
Why do you talk like this?

886
01:04:58,667 --> 01:05:00,458
Why are you unnecessarily avoiding Nisha?

887
01:05:00,542 --> 01:05:02,708
She's not a woman, she's a ghost!

888
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:05,667
What do you know about her?

889
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:10,208
Listen.

890
01:05:10,708 --> 01:05:12,167
Nisha's not a ghost.

891
01:05:13,458 --> 01:05:14,750
She's the angel who saved your life.

892
01:05:17,375 --> 01:05:19,375
Nisha studied in our college too.

893
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:22,792
Since then she's been in love with you.

894
01:05:38,875 --> 01:05:42,833
<i>"I raise with that glance of yours."</i>

895
01:05:43,125 --> 01:05:46,833
<i>"And I fall for it again."</i>

896
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:52,583
<i>"I want you to see me."</i>

897
01:05:52,792 --> 01:05:57,167
<i>"And I get lost in you."</i>

898
01:05:58,333 --> 01:06:02,333
<i>"The moments that I am away from you."</i>

899
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:07,417
<i>"I feel calamity in my heart."</i>

900
01:06:07,667 --> 01:06:11,875
<i>"I am writing a poem..."</i>

901
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:19,667
<i>"...that paints my heart's desires, my dear!"</i>

902
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:26,208
<i>"I raise with that glance of yours."</i>

903
01:06:26,417 --> 01:06:31,167
<i>"And I fall for it again."</i>

904
01:07:00,542 --> 01:07:05,125
<i>"I see you the way."</i>

905
01:07:05,333 --> 01:07:09,292
<i>"earth sees the distant clouds."</i>

906
01:07:10,125 --> 01:07:14,583
<i>"You touched as the rain drops once."</i>

907
01:07:14,917 --> 01:07:19,500
<i>"Did you know that dear?"</i>

908
01:07:19,708 --> 01:07:24,208
<i>"My heart became a mirage."</i>

909
01:07:24,542 --> 01:07:27,917
<i>"Will my love be understood?"</i>

910
01:07:29,292 --> 01:07:33,750
<i>"Are all these times just a waste?"</i>

911
01:07:34,125 --> 01:07:38,000
<i>"I'm gathering memories."</i>

912
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:45,167
<i>"to fall in love all over again, my dear."</i>

913
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:47,750
<i>"Beloved."</i>

914
01:08:47,333 --> 01:08:50,833
It's because of her that you're alive today!

915
01:08:52,958 --> 01:08:55,125
Do you really love him?

916
01:09:00,417 --> 01:09:02,417
I'll make him understand.

917
01:09:02,833 --> 01:09:04,917
Let's prevent him from committing suicide by making him fall in love!

918
01:09:05,167 --> 01:09:07,250
I have a great plan to make this happen!

919
01:09:11,833 --> 01:09:13,042
Nisha is different.

920
01:09:13,792 --> 01:09:16,042
She was ready to give herself just to save your life!

921
01:09:17,167 --> 01:09:17,875
Come.

922
01:09:20,458 --> 01:09:22,625
Nisha, is the food ready?

923
01:09:22,792 --> 01:09:26,792
Are you making food or doing a diploma course. Why is the food still not ready!

924
01:09:27,667 --> 01:09:29,333
I'm dieing of hunger.

925
01:09:29,417 --> 01:09:31,000
They brought me here to to die after a goodmeal.

926
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:33,292
But looks like I'll die out of hunger!

927
01:09:33,333 --> 01:09:36,042
Look at the best buddy's coming together.

928
01:09:36,208 --> 01:09:38,458
- I need my food now. - Wait.

929
01:09:38,667 --> 01:09:40,583
Why are you sitting here now?

930
01:09:40,667 --> 01:09:41,750
- Dude. - Go to your room.

931
01:09:42,708 --> 01:09:43,625
Have fun.

932
01:09:47,125 --> 01:09:49,333
- Have fun? - Go!

933
01:09:49,875 --> 01:09:53,750
Your proving yourself to be a pimp, I see nothing else happening right.

934
01:09:53,917 --> 01:09:56,333
- I need my food now! - Shut up.

935
01:10:01,792 --> 01:10:03,667
- Is eating that important now? - Then? Is this more important?

936
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:04,667
Their happiness is more important for me!

937
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:06,708
- The food is more important for me! - Go have it at a hotel outside!

938
01:10:06,792 --> 01:10:07,792
Buddy.

939
01:10:07,958 --> 01:10:10,125
I heard you used to follow me once?

940
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:12,625
How come I didn't notice that.

941
01:10:14,083 --> 01:10:16,167
How would you notice this poor little girl?

942
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:19,042
You could only notice Swathi.

943
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:30,917
Why don't you help me?

944
01:10:51,125 --> 01:10:52,667
I need my food now.

945
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:55,500
- I'll go get the food myself. - Wait, wait.

946
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:03,542
What is going on here?

947
01:11:16,958 --> 01:11:19,083
Isn't the food ready yet?

948
01:11:19,167 --> 01:11:21,042
Nope, he's having it.

949
01:11:22,333 --> 01:11:24,750
My stomach aches in hunger.

950
01:11:24,833 --> 01:11:27,083
And he's romancing inside.

951
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:31,125
Don't worry Rosemary. We'll have full meals.

952
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:28,500
Can we have some extra rice?

953
01:12:33,917 --> 01:12:35,208
What happened Nisha?

954
01:12:36,458 --> 01:12:38,875
Every time I try getting close to him.

955
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:42,333
He just moves away.

956
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:45,333
What wrong did I do?

957
01:12:46,917 --> 01:12:50,833
- Nisha! - Why the hell is he doing this?

958
01:12:53,333 --> 01:12:56,292
What went wrong now? What's wrong with you?

959
01:12:56,458 --> 01:12:59,042
She's got some split personality.

960
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:02,958
- I'm getting scared dude. - You are the one having a problem.

961
01:13:03,167 --> 01:13:05,708
You just want to use and dump her.

962
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:09,125
- She's innocent. - Is she?

963
01:13:09,292 --> 01:13:10,958
To me it doesn't seem to be like that.

964
01:13:11,333 --> 01:13:12,958
She thrashed me against the wall.

965
01:13:13,042 --> 01:13:15,458
What are you blabbering?

966
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:17,458
Why would she want to throw you against the wall.

967
01:13:17,708 --> 01:13:19,542
- God how do I make him understand! - Listen.

968
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:22,000
Get her back before she does something to herself.

969
01:13:22,208 --> 01:13:25,458
What if she does something to herself. What's your problem?

970
01:13:25,583 --> 01:13:26,958
I said I'll come with you.

971
01:13:27,375 --> 01:13:29,375
- Come. I'm there. - No. Leave me.

972
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:39,667
Go.

973
01:13:49,167 --> 01:13:50,583
You avoided me.

974
01:13:51,292 --> 01:13:52,458
Why are you here now?

975
01:13:53,083 --> 01:13:54,208
Get out of the room.

976
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,208
Listen to me.

977
01:13:58,292 --> 01:14:02,500
You get annoyed each time I get closer to you!

978
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:04,917
Me? Am I avoiding you?

979
01:14:06,042 --> 01:14:08,125
Do I look like I'll get annoyed?

980
01:14:08,542 --> 01:14:11,625
I'm not that puny to freak out every time you see me.

981
01:14:11,792 --> 01:14:13,917
There were guys who were hitting on me during college.

982
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:15,375
But--

983
01:14:16,333 --> 01:14:17,792
I only like you.

984
01:14:18,125 --> 01:14:20,292
I was interested only in you!

985
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:23,583
But, every time I try touching you.

986
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:27,333
- Come. - No, I'm not coming.

987
01:14:27,875 --> 01:14:30,667
- I don't want to be hit again. - Come on.

988
01:14:40,042 --> 01:14:43,667
- I love you Kathir. - Me too.

989
01:14:54,417 --> 01:14:56,542
Don't you have any sense Karuppu?

990
01:14:56,917 --> 01:14:58,083
Is this what you capture?

991
01:14:58,625 --> 01:15:01,250
Keep quiet, the scene is just getting started!

992
01:15:01,375 --> 01:15:03,792
You're yet to watch her performance.

993
01:15:19,375 --> 01:15:20,667
Take off your hands!

994
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:25,458
I'm asking you to take off your hands and your still keep hugging.

995
01:15:54,292 --> 01:15:58,333
Just because you act sweet, you think any girl would be ready to get laid.

996
01:16:00,375 --> 01:16:04,000
I know your intentions of why you are coming to Nisha's room.

997
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:06,958
How dare you touch her even after my warning!

998
01:16:08,458 --> 01:16:11,417
You can fool her! But not me!

999
01:16:13,042 --> 01:16:15,000
Leave me.

1000
01:16:22,375 --> 01:16:27,875
Do you know how ecstatic I am to see fear in a Man's eyes?

1001
01:16:32,292 --> 01:16:34,333
Pack up tomorrow morning!

1002
01:17:24,958 --> 01:17:26,167
Kathir.

1003
01:17:28,417 --> 01:17:31,833
Kathir, stay. Listen to me stay!

1004
01:17:31,875 --> 01:17:36,500
Kathir stay. He's not going to pay you, stop the auto!

1005
01:17:37,833 --> 01:17:40,250
Sir! You look like Shah Rukh Khan! Please give me a lift!

1006
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:42,917
Hold on, hold on. Stop.

1007
01:17:43,083 --> 01:17:45,333
Thank you so much, you can head for your shoot now. Bye.

1008
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:46,917
Your fare.

1009
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,625
- Get down. I said get down. - Leave me.

1010
01:17:49,917 --> 01:17:51,333
How can you leave like this?

1011
01:17:52,958 --> 01:17:54,083
Kumaran, Leave me.

1012
01:17:54,958 --> 01:17:57,375
- I can't stay here anymore. - Why all of a sudden?

1013
01:17:57,458 --> 01:17:59,042
You have no clue how she tortured me last night!

1014
01:17:59,125 --> 01:18:00,542
Who Nisha?

1015
01:18:00,833 --> 01:18:01,958
She's innocent.

1016
01:18:02,708 --> 01:18:05,250
I'm not blaming Nisha, but the spirit that has possessed her.

1017
01:18:05,583 --> 01:18:08,333
She freaks me out, leaves me hanging on the top!

1018
01:18:09,167 --> 01:18:11,750
I can never think about getting back to that house. I'm leaving.

1019
01:18:12,167 --> 01:18:14,833
If you don't like her just tell that instead of cooking up stories.

1020
01:18:15,542 --> 01:18:16,625
When did I deny?

1021
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:18,792
I do really love Nisha.

1022
01:18:18,917 --> 01:18:20,625
But the spirit that's possessed her is not letting me near her!

1023
01:18:20,708 --> 01:18:23,208
You say that you love her, then how could you walk away.

1024
01:18:23,375 --> 01:18:25,125
No matter how serious the problem is, you need to face it!

1025
01:18:25,292 --> 01:18:26,833
I'll solve the problem, trust me.

1026
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,625
I don't think you understood anything of what I said!

1027
01:18:29,792 --> 01:18:32,625
I do understand. I know you love her.

1028
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:35,458
Wait and watch, I'll sort out this issue today!

1029
01:18:35,542 --> 01:18:36,125
C'mon!

1030
01:18:39,792 --> 01:18:40,833
Bro, close the gate.

1031
01:18:41,667 --> 01:18:43,833
- I said close the gate. - I've brought the evidence.

1032
01:18:45,083 --> 01:18:46,750
Which horror movie is this now?

1033
01:18:47,292 --> 01:18:49,292
Come in and watch my movie now.

1034
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:52,708
Please close the gate before some dog gets in.

1035
01:18:53,542 --> 01:18:56,083
- Nisha. I'll handle. - No dude, don't do this.

1036
01:18:56,292 --> 01:18:57,125
Nisha.

1037
01:18:57,208 --> 01:18:58,375
Why do you want to call her now?

1038
01:18:58,458 --> 01:19:01,000
I'll handle. Nisha!

1039
01:19:01,542 --> 01:19:03,542
Where are you hiding?

1040
01:19:04,083 --> 01:19:05,000
Come.

1041
01:19:06,167 --> 01:19:07,042
Nisha.

1042
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:10,875
Are you going to come out or not?

1043
01:19:11,708 --> 01:19:14,208
You better come out, I need to talk.

1044
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:18,042
Dude, you stay here. I'll go get her. Nisha.

1045
01:19:57,333 --> 01:19:58,667
You rascal!

1046
01:20:00,833 --> 01:20:02,083
Have you gone crazy?

1047
01:20:02,542 --> 01:20:05,167
Don't you see the struggle I am going through to patch you guys!

1048
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:08,792
And you don't even seem to be bothered. Why?

1049
01:20:09,875 --> 01:20:11,333
I came to smash your face.

1050
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,125
The only reason I am keeping quiet is because you're innocent.

1051
01:20:16,917 --> 01:20:18,917
Calm down Kumaran. Calm down, calm down.

1052
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:22,375
Listen to me.

1053
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:26,208
Before I get mad at you. Go and pacify him!

1054
01:20:27,417 --> 01:20:29,333
I said go.

1055
01:20:31,208 --> 01:20:33,458
What are you waiting for?

1056
01:20:33,583 --> 01:20:34,667
Hey!

1057
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:36,042
What is it?

1058
01:20:42,542 --> 01:20:45,042
Why don't you listen to me? Nisha.

1059
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:58,375
So you're the one who is behind this?

1060
01:20:58,875 --> 01:21:00,125
You pimp!

1061
01:21:00,417 --> 01:21:03,167
What's this Halloween party all about?

1062
01:21:03,542 --> 01:21:05,417
I'm not Nisha!

1063
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,042
Then who are you?

1064
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:38,208
You warned me about the spirit...

1065
01:21:38,458 --> 01:21:41,417
...but you never warned me about her slapping!

1066
01:21:50,708 --> 01:21:53,333
Why are you wearing a helmet?

1067
01:21:53,667 --> 01:21:56,458
Just as a shield for the head.. A shield for life!

1068
01:22:03,458 --> 01:22:05,000
Why are you losing on purpose?

1069
01:22:05,083 --> 01:22:06,500
I want to lose!

1070
01:22:06,583 --> 01:22:08,875
I would be happy even if you win.

1071
01:22:08,958 --> 01:22:10,417
What might she be up to!

1072
01:22:10,583 --> 01:22:12,750
If I win this game...

1073
01:22:13,625 --> 01:22:15,417
...the whole night...

1074
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,583
...you'll have to spend with me.

1075
01:22:18,042 --> 01:22:20,042
Why does she want us to be with her?

1076
01:22:20,125 --> 01:22:22,250
Sorry, not us. You.

1077
01:22:22,667 --> 01:22:24,333
- I'm Leaving. - Don't go!

1078
01:22:25,625 --> 01:22:27,625
What are you guys whispering?

1079
01:22:27,708 --> 01:22:30,542
Nothing, nothing, there's completely nothing.

1080
01:22:33,458 --> 01:22:38,083
Nisha, with the help of the Queen you can defeat the King this way.

1081
01:22:46,583 --> 01:22:48,417
There.. she takes off again.

1082
01:22:51,875 --> 01:22:54,542
Why did you touch Nisha now?

1083
01:22:57,375 --> 01:22:58,500
Karuppu.

1084
01:22:58,958 --> 01:23:01,625
What's that noise like a blaring loudspeaker!

1085
01:23:01,875 --> 01:23:07,000
What will the queen do if she's surrounded by 5 pawns?

1086
01:23:07,292 --> 01:23:08,500
No! We don't know.

1087
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:10,625
Tell me.

1088
01:23:10,917 --> 01:23:12,292
Let's go and see what's happening.

1089
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:15,542
I'm not coming. I know what's going on inside. You go.

1090
01:23:17,958 --> 01:23:21,167
You are a kid and that's why you're freaking out.

1091
01:23:21,417 --> 01:23:23,625
No one can be as brave as I am.

1092
01:23:23,708 --> 01:23:26,750
<i>"When I smack you."</i>

1093
01:23:26,833 --> 01:23:29,917
<i>"When I smack you, you won't be able to bear it."</i>

1094
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,958
<i>"Try me, you won't get back home."</i>

1095
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:37,542
<i>"When I smack you, you won't be able to bear it."</i>

1096
01:23:38,125 --> 01:23:40,208
- Dude today he's screwed! - Who?

1097
01:23:40,292 --> 01:23:41,125
- Who? - You!

1098
01:23:41,208 --> 01:23:44,792
Who was the one yelling with fear?

1099
01:23:45,333 --> 01:23:47,208
You guys take advantage because the house owner isn't home.

1100
01:23:47,542 --> 01:23:50,333
We are all paying guests and we shouldn't be yelling this way.

1101
01:23:50,542 --> 01:23:52,208
Who was the one who as yelling?

1102
01:23:52,292 --> 01:23:54,542
Not me, it was Nisha.

1103
01:23:55,375 --> 01:24:00,542
She's a sweetheart.. She is playing chess silently.

1104
01:24:00,875 --> 01:24:02,917
And you accuse her of yelling.

1105
01:24:03,417 --> 01:24:05,417
Where you the one yelling sweetheart?

1106
01:24:08,583 --> 01:24:09,917
I will understand.

1107
01:24:10,083 --> 01:24:12,667
Did Kathir refuse to kiss you?

1108
01:24:12,917 --> 01:24:15,542
Don't worry I'll make him give you everything!

1109
01:24:16,083 --> 01:24:19,583
Why are you making her to crave?

1110
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:20,417
You're done.

1111
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:21,917
She is innocent!

1112
01:24:22,792 --> 01:24:23,958
I will sort this out.

1113
01:24:24,042 --> 01:24:27,458
- Come, come closer. Come. - I won't. No, I won't.

1114
01:24:28,208 --> 01:24:31,625
Why don't you both kiss and patch up!

1115
01:24:31,792 --> 01:24:33,667
Open up your hearts.

1116
01:24:33,708 --> 01:24:38,000
Look into her eyes. Come on, come on.

1117
01:24:39,125 --> 01:24:42,125
Not me! It's the guy in the black gown! Come Kathir!

1118
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:49,000
You stinky mouth.

1119
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:52,250
Why modulation change.

1120
01:24:52,333 --> 01:24:54,750
What was that song you were singing?

1121
01:24:54,833 --> 01:24:59,500
It's a song called smack that.

1122
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,500
Sing the song.

1123
01:25:01,667 --> 01:25:03,875
<i>"When I smack you."</i>

1124
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:06,125
- Then smack me! - Oh no!

1125
01:25:06,667 --> 01:25:08,292
No. No!

1126
01:25:08,958 --> 01:25:11,958
Kumara!! Kathir!! Save me!

1127
01:25:12,042 --> 01:25:15,500
I'm terrified 69, 79, 89.

1128
01:26:08,208 --> 01:26:10,333
Where are you going?

1129
01:26:10,708 --> 01:26:16,083
May I please go to the toilet?

1130
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,375
I'll be back.

1131
01:26:17,458 --> 01:26:19,042
Will you?

1132
01:26:19,292 --> 01:26:22,042
Why? Is there anything more you want to do?

1133
01:26:32,917 --> 01:26:35,208
Kathir, he has finished his innings!

1134
01:26:36,542 --> 01:26:38,917
Why is he coming like a zombie?

1135
01:26:39,375 --> 01:26:42,375
He doesn't leave that wretched wig even now!

1136
01:26:45,167 --> 01:26:47,917
- It's locked. It's unbearable! - What's locked?

1137
01:26:48,292 --> 01:26:50,458
Her beatings have locked up all my joints!

1138
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,333
Hey! I plead you!

1139
01:26:54,833 --> 01:26:57,167
Please save me.

1140
01:26:59,083 --> 01:27:00,958
I'll sleep here.

1141
01:27:01,042 --> 01:27:03,917
How mean of her to hit me.

1142
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:19,375
Mommy!

1143
01:27:50,458 --> 01:27:51,333
Oh no.

1144
01:27:53,458 --> 01:27:55,542
Good Morning guys!

1145
01:27:57,250 --> 01:28:00,042
- Good morning! - Good morning, good morning!

1146
01:28:01,417 --> 01:28:03,875
The breakfast is ready. Come let's have.

1147
01:28:04,042 --> 01:28:07,125
We are not hungry.

1148
01:28:07,167 --> 01:28:10,333
You carry on, we'll join you in a while.

1149
01:28:11,792 --> 01:28:13,833
Do you know what I have prepared especially for you?

1150
01:28:14,208 --> 01:28:15,333
What?

1151
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:18,667
I have made a delicious dessert with raisins and badham.

1152
01:28:18,833 --> 01:28:19,833
Desert.

1153
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,792
Shut up and stay there.

1154
01:28:21,917 --> 01:28:26,083
That's not a dessert its a poison she's made to kill us.

1155
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:28,458
Come soon, it'll get cold.

1156
01:28:28,708 --> 01:28:32,833
We're still not over last night but look at her offering us dessert.

1157
01:28:34,917 --> 01:28:36,917
- But the desert-- - Hey!

1158
01:28:37,208 --> 01:28:39,875
Don't put your life at stake for a dessert. Keep quiet.

1159
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:42,917
- What shall we do now? - I'll tell you.

1160
01:28:44,042 --> 01:28:46,333
I already warned you about this.

1161
01:28:46,375 --> 01:28:48,125
But none of you listened to me!

1162
01:28:48,333 --> 01:28:50,542
The only way out is, let's go and meet her.

1163
01:28:50,917 --> 01:28:52,917
- Whom? - Mayamma.

1164
01:29:02,083 --> 01:29:05,583
Look at her, she seems capable.

1165
01:29:05,917 --> 01:29:07,958
I'm sure she is a ghost rider.

1166
01:29:08,417 --> 01:29:11,208
She seems to be an expert.

1167
01:29:11,625 --> 01:29:16,167
Look at the ferocity with which she is handling that ghost.

1168
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:18,875
Wait and watch.

1169
01:29:20,292 --> 01:29:23,083
How was that? Come, let me introduce.

1170
01:29:27,292 --> 01:29:28,333
Mayamma.

1171
01:29:28,708 --> 01:29:31,125
- How many of them? - 4 of them.

1172
01:29:31,583 --> 01:29:33,625
Go, hand it over.

1173
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,292
Don't shout.

1174
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:40,250
- Here. - What is that? A trapped spirit?

1175
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:43,000
It's just hooch.

1176
01:29:43,167 --> 01:29:44,250
Then what is that?

1177
01:29:45,125 --> 01:29:47,583
She is preparing a dish for supper.

1178
01:29:47,667 --> 01:29:49,583
- Is she a hooch peddler? - Yes.

1179
01:29:49,667 --> 01:29:51,250
Then why did you bring us here?

1180
01:29:53,875 --> 01:29:54,833
I'll kill you.

1181
01:29:56,417 --> 01:29:59,458
The build up was a bit too much.

1182
01:29:59,708 --> 01:30:03,250
So, it's the stew that's creating this fuss here.

1183
01:30:04,208 --> 01:30:05,583
Dude, this is not working out.

1184
01:30:05,792 --> 01:30:07,250
Let's take her along and vacate the house.

1185
01:30:07,333 --> 01:30:08,167
Come, let's go.

1186
01:30:08,333 --> 01:30:09,583
That spirit isn't going to leave her.

1187
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:17,083
- So, what is the way out? - It will follow her wherever she goes.

1188
01:30:18,208 --> 01:30:19,708
You should get rid of that spirit.

1189
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:21,708
And there is a person who can do that.

1190
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:22,958
He is the specialist.

1191
01:30:23,292 --> 01:30:25,417
Who is that specialist?

1192
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:26,708
Ghost Gopal Varma.

1193
01:30:44,917 --> 01:30:46,917
Hail Sadagopan Ramesh!

1194
01:30:49,583 --> 01:30:52,125
I will kill you man, go away.

1195
01:30:52,667 --> 01:30:54,167
I'll kill you!

1196
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:57,000
People chat with their loved ones on Skype but look at him chatting with a ghost.

1197
01:30:58,583 --> 01:30:59,708
Don't you dare.

1198
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:03,542
Look at that guy suffering because of him!

1199
01:31:04,458 --> 01:31:06,625
I'm coming for you.

1200
01:31:07,542 --> 01:31:08,375
I'm waiting.

1201
01:31:12,167 --> 01:31:15,500
Looks like that spirit is dangerous.

1202
01:31:15,583 --> 01:31:17,333
Yes, very dangerous.

1203
01:31:17,583 --> 01:31:19,375
So, it needs some special equipments.

1204
01:31:19,583 --> 01:31:20,625
Take the holy water.

1205
01:31:20,917 --> 01:31:22,208
The holy water?

1206
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:26,417
This is no ordinary water.

1207
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:28,375
Then, what else? Liquor?

1208
01:31:28,458 --> 01:31:31,625
So she does business with stew and you, with liquor?

1209
01:31:31,667 --> 01:31:34,375
No, this is holy water.

1210
01:31:34,833 --> 01:31:36,708
It is prepared by collecting waters from...

1211
01:31:36,792 --> 01:31:38,792
...all the rivers of the world and it is magical!

1212
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:41,250
Sundari take those cashews?

1213
01:31:43,792 --> 01:31:46,625
For what? Strengthening the spirit?

1214
01:31:47,042 --> 01:31:49,000
This is a spiritual cashew, you fool.

1215
01:31:49,833 --> 01:31:52,750
Throw it and the spirit will vanish.

1216
01:31:53,125 --> 01:31:55,833
Make all arrangements, I'll be there tonight.

1217
01:31:56,125 --> 01:31:59,458
Let's see. Who wins, me or the spirit.

1218
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:03,250
Hail Sadagopan Ramesh!

1219
01:32:07,417 --> 01:32:08,500
Nisha!

1220
01:32:22,542 --> 01:32:24,500
Hail Sadagopan Ramesh!

1221
01:32:24,583 --> 01:32:25,417
Call her.

1222
01:32:29,542 --> 01:32:30,625
Nisha.

1223
01:32:31,625 --> 01:32:32,750
Nisha.

1224
01:32:38,333 --> 01:32:40,708
Hey, what is this madness?

1225
01:32:41,792 --> 01:32:43,833
Who is this clown?

1226
01:32:44,125 --> 01:32:45,042
Who is he?

1227
01:32:45,125 --> 01:32:48,667
I don't see any spirit, all I see is an innocent girl.

1228
01:32:48,875 --> 01:32:49,750
Where is the devil?

1229
01:32:50,083 --> 01:32:51,875
There is a small issue?

1230
01:32:51,958 --> 01:32:52,667
What?

1231
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:54,375
She gets possessed only when someone touches her.

1232
01:32:54,458 --> 01:32:56,917
What are you saying?

1233
01:32:57,167 --> 01:32:59,167
I know what happens when you touch a girl.

1234
01:32:59,292 --> 01:33:01,875
But certainly never knew she could be possessed by touching her!

1235
01:33:02,083 --> 01:33:05,375
She has dressed up just like me. Now someone go and touch her.

1236
01:33:05,458 --> 01:33:06,333
- Hey Kathir, go on. - You?

1237
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:07,333
Sorry.

1238
01:33:07,792 --> 01:33:10,667
- Someone go and touch. - Go.

1239
01:33:30,167 --> 01:33:31,875
Forgive me.

1240
01:33:36,792 --> 01:33:37,875
Come back! Come back!

1241
01:33:39,667 --> 01:33:41,625
He just asked you to touch her not hug her.

1242
01:34:07,625 --> 01:34:10,000
- Gopal sir, please save us. - Just leave me.

1243
01:34:14,875 --> 01:34:16,542
She is nearing us!

1244
01:34:19,583 --> 01:34:20,958
Hail Sadagopan Ramesh!

1245
01:34:21,167 --> 01:34:22,792
You have not seen an expert like me.

1246
01:34:22,875 --> 01:34:24,875
Come on bro, come on bro. You can do it.

1247
01:34:25,167 --> 01:34:26,083
Nice fashion.

1248
01:34:27,833 --> 01:34:30,042
If you have the guts...

1249
01:34:30,125 --> 01:34:32,417
...then try attacking us now.

1250
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,417
Take the equipment. Take the holy water.

1251
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:38,792
Take and give it to him.

1252
01:34:42,042 --> 01:34:47,292
How's that? He is the same exorcist who chased away the conjuring ghost.

1253
01:34:49,917 --> 01:34:53,750
Wait and watch what he'll do to you.

1254
01:34:53,833 --> 01:34:56,583
He is all set to chase you away.

1255
01:34:58,542 --> 01:35:01,792
Why are you splashing little? Spill it entirely on her.

1256
01:35:01,875 --> 01:35:04,500
I can sense fear in her, just spill it on her.

1257
01:35:04,625 --> 01:35:05,625
We'll pour it all.

1258
01:35:05,708 --> 01:35:06,708
- Give it to me, I'll do it. - No.

1259
01:35:06,792 --> 01:35:08,500
- Give me. - No don't.

1260
01:35:08,583 --> 01:35:11,667
Listen to me you wig head.

1261
01:35:11,917 --> 01:35:13,375
Don't!

1262
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:15,667
Hey!

1263
01:35:15,875 --> 01:35:19,333
- Listen to me. - No!

1264
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:22,500
You fools.

1265
01:35:26,083 --> 01:35:29,208
Now why did you spill it on him?

1266
01:35:29,583 --> 01:35:31,417
Forgive me Gopal.

1267
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:34,708
Gopal sir, please don't be upset, it was a mistake.

1268
01:35:35,125 --> 01:35:36,167
Just shut up.

1269
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:42,167
Come on guys. Don't get discouraged.

1270
01:35:42,333 --> 01:35:44,833
It doesn't matter if we don't have the holy water. We have the holy water!

1271
01:35:45,167 --> 01:35:45,833
Take them.

1272
01:35:45,917 --> 01:35:47,875
Didn't I tell you that he is an expert! Take those cashews!

1273
01:35:47,958 --> 01:35:48,792
What?

1274
01:35:49,083 --> 01:35:50,667
Are you hungry?

1275
01:35:50,792 --> 01:35:52,417
What is this craziness?

1276
01:35:54,208 --> 01:35:55,917
Don't worry boys.

1277
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:57,458
We are all protected by the spiritual rope.

1278
01:35:57,542 --> 01:35:58,375
Nisha!

1279
01:36:01,833 --> 01:36:03,292
She won't dare to cross this.

1280
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,500
I'm ghost Gopal Varma.

1281
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,042
Will she dare to near me!

1282
01:36:09,208 --> 01:36:09,750
No. Never.

1283
01:36:09,833 --> 01:36:12,083
- Will it come? - It won't Gopal.

1284
01:36:12,167 --> 01:36:12,958
Nisha!

1285
01:36:14,375 --> 01:36:16,875
He is trying to help us and why are you insulting him.

1286
01:36:16,917 --> 01:36:17,792
Nisha.

1287
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,208
Don't.

1288
01:36:22,917 --> 01:36:26,333
Listen to me. Don't.

1289
01:36:40,625 --> 01:36:41,958
Oh God!

1290
01:36:48,417 --> 01:36:49,667
Hey strong lady.

1291
01:36:50,208 --> 01:36:54,083
I'm too old for this. Handle me with care.

1292
01:37:01,792 --> 01:37:04,167
Why aren't any of you talking to me properly?

1293
01:37:04,583 --> 01:37:06,417
Why are you all scared of me?

1294
01:37:06,667 --> 01:37:08,125
I must know the truth.

1295
01:37:08,625 --> 01:37:12,458
- She is asking. Answer her. - No way. I won't tell, get lost.

1296
01:37:14,042 --> 01:37:15,250
Nisha--

1297
01:37:16,125 --> 01:37:17,333
Don't know how to convey this.

1298
01:37:17,417 --> 01:37:18,833
Just spill it.

1299
01:37:18,917 --> 01:37:19,417
Nisha.

1300
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:20,958
Hey! You have been possessed.

1301
01:37:22,708 --> 01:37:23,500
What?

1302
01:37:23,583 --> 01:37:24,833
Am I indeed possessed?

1303
01:37:24,917 --> 01:37:26,417
Then who else? Me?

1304
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:28,375
Yes! Your are indeed possessed.

1305
01:37:28,542 --> 01:37:30,667
The poundings you showered on me.

1306
01:37:30,792 --> 01:37:31,792
Were death blows.

1307
01:37:31,875 --> 01:37:34,833
It's still haunting me.

1308
01:37:34,917 --> 01:37:37,292
We tried our best to get rid of that spirit...

1309
01:37:37,625 --> 01:37:39,375
...but it was in vain.

1310
01:37:39,875 --> 01:37:42,542
So how do we get rid of it now?

1311
01:37:42,833 --> 01:37:45,792
- I have another idea. - One more word and I'll kill you.

1312
01:37:46,125 --> 01:37:47,292
Worthless ideas.

1313
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Okay friends.

1314
01:37:49,250 --> 01:37:50,583
I'll take this in my own hands.

1315
01:37:51,083 --> 01:37:52,083
Pass me the phone.

1316
01:37:54,167 --> 01:37:55,208
Brother, it's me Adhisiyam.

1317
01:37:55,292 --> 01:37:55,917
Tell me.

1318
01:37:56,208 --> 01:37:57,083
How is Rose?

1319
01:37:57,125 --> 01:37:58,167
Going on.

1320
01:37:58,250 --> 01:38:00,792
Nothing serious, a spirit has been possessed by a girl.

1321
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:01,417
- Hey! - What?

1322
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:02,375
Why are you blabbering?

1323
01:38:02,542 --> 01:38:06,083
A girl we know has been possessed. How do we get rid of that spirit?

1324
01:38:06,333 --> 01:38:07,458
That's not a big deal.

1325
01:38:07,667 --> 01:38:10,250
Offer whatever it likes and slipper her! It will go away...

1326
01:38:10,333 --> 01:38:11,792
- ...but one thing. - Leave it, I got it...

1327
01:38:11,875 --> 01:38:16,500
...explain nothing more, I will take care of it.

1328
01:38:17,667 --> 01:38:22,750
Just wait and watch me chase away that spirit tonight.

1329
01:38:28,250 --> 01:38:29,625
Wow! Delicious leg piece.

1330
01:38:31,292 --> 01:38:32,042
Stupid.

1331
01:38:32,458 --> 01:38:33,458
Place it back!

1332
01:38:34,458 --> 01:38:35,792
It's an offering for the spirit.

1333
01:38:37,083 --> 01:38:39,000
Oh.. so these are all offerings for the spirit?

1334
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:40,250
Alright but--

1335
01:38:40,792 --> 01:38:43,083
Why have you placed Abbas' photo here?

1336
01:38:43,167 --> 01:38:44,250
Nonsense.

1337
01:38:44,375 --> 01:38:45,375
He is my friend.

1338
01:38:45,792 --> 01:38:46,792
Mr. Jack.

1339
01:38:47,208 --> 01:38:48,542
London TV artist.

1340
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:56,000
Not only girls but also the spirits from here like him more than us.

1341
01:38:56,083 --> 01:38:59,542
- That is why I have placed his photo. - Kathir.

1342
01:39:00,583 --> 01:39:03,167
Are spirits and ghosts real!

1343
01:39:03,375 --> 01:39:05,417
Until I came here, I never believed in it.

1344
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,333
But after seeing you.

1345
01:39:07,542 --> 01:39:09,625
I swear that ghosts are for real.

1346
01:39:09,708 --> 01:39:12,917
Indeed. The spirit doesn't know what is in store for it today.

1347
01:39:14,208 --> 01:39:17,958
I guess you haven't seen me getting violent after drinking.

1348
01:39:18,292 --> 01:39:19,708
It's freaky.

1349
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,125
Are you indeed going to hit me Adhisiyam?

1350
01:39:22,333 --> 01:39:24,250
Not you sweetheart.

1351
01:39:24,417 --> 01:39:26,417
You are innocent.

1352
01:39:26,708 --> 01:39:28,458
but the spirit inside you.

1353
01:39:28,833 --> 01:39:30,917
I am going to bash it up...

1354
01:39:31,292 --> 01:39:32,667
...and get rid of it for once and all.

1355
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:36,042
Watch out, if something goes wrong then you will be in deep trouble.

1356
01:39:36,125 --> 01:39:37,625
Shut your mouth fool!

1357
01:39:38,333 --> 01:39:42,625
If we had killed ourselves the day we came, we could have haunted others.

1358
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:46,625
But now she is the one possessed and it's haunting us now!

1359
01:39:46,875 --> 01:39:48,958
Tonight I'll seal the devil's fate!

1360
01:39:49,333 --> 01:39:53,250
- It's either do or die. - Definitely you are going to die.

1361
01:39:53,458 --> 01:39:57,792
Karuppu, I am getting into action, turn on the camera.

1362
01:39:59,375 --> 01:40:00,333
Is the artist ready?

1363
01:40:00,417 --> 01:40:01,250
Action!

1364
01:40:01,333 --> 01:40:02,333
Come one! Come on!

1365
01:40:02,417 --> 01:40:03,083
Pick up! Pick up!

1366
01:40:03,167 --> 01:40:05,500
Take up! Take up! Touch up! Touch up!

1367
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:06,708
Hug her!

1368
01:40:06,792 --> 01:40:09,750
Hug her firmly! Do it like you do always!

1369
01:40:09,833 --> 01:40:10,458
Kathir.

1370
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:14,042
Please don't leave me once I'm possessed.

1371
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:18,042
You sound lovely like this, but when possessed there is no love at all.

1372
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:19,125
Mr. Adhisiyam.

1373
01:40:20,042 --> 01:40:21,083
- I've got a doubt. - What?

1374
01:40:21,167 --> 01:40:22,833
Now who is trying to hook them up? You or me?

1375
01:40:22,917 --> 01:40:23,917
Shut up.

1376
01:40:23,958 --> 01:40:26,667
Come out now! We are all set here. Don't keep us waiting. Where are you?

1377
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:28,667
He's calling her as if it's his girlfriend.

1378
01:40:30,625 --> 01:40:34,208
Sweetheart.. are you experiencing any symptoms?

1379
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:35,708
Nothing?

1380
01:40:38,583 --> 01:40:39,167
Nothing.

1381
01:40:39,250 --> 01:40:40,167
Nothing?

1382
01:40:40,333 --> 01:40:42,042
Where are you? It's getting late.

1383
01:40:42,250 --> 01:40:43,875
They can't be hugging for too long.

1384
01:40:43,958 --> 01:40:45,750
Why aren't you showing up? I dare you.

1385
01:40:45,958 --> 01:40:48,708
Come on now. I dare you again. Pour me a drink now.

1386
01:40:48,917 --> 01:40:49,917
Pour me a drink.

1387
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,125
The deal is ON!

1388
01:40:51,458 --> 01:40:52,708
Your drink is ready. Have it.

1389
01:40:52,917 --> 01:40:53,667
Keep a close shot!

1390
01:40:53,750 --> 01:40:54,333
A close shot!

1391
01:40:54,458 --> 01:40:56,583
Inform me at once, if it arrives!

1392
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,375
As I said, it's do or die.

1393
01:40:59,708 --> 01:41:00,750
Cheers!

1394
01:41:01,292 --> 01:41:02,292
Cheers Jack.

1395
01:41:07,667 --> 01:41:09,917
I feel pity for the spirit.

1396
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:10,708
Why so?

1397
01:41:10,875 --> 01:41:12,958
No one survives when I bash them.

1398
01:41:13,708 --> 01:41:15,917
but this spirit, its already dead.

1399
01:41:16,792 --> 01:41:18,125
I wonder what it's gonna do!

1400
01:41:18,333 --> 01:41:18,958
I pity it.

1401
01:41:19,125 --> 01:41:22,792
- But I am going to show no mercy. - So will the spirit.

1402
01:41:22,875 --> 01:41:24,958
Why are you boasting about the spirit?

1403
01:41:25,208 --> 01:41:30,208
I will bash it, wrap it and walk off without any sign.

1404
01:41:30,375 --> 01:41:32,792
<i>"I am calling you out, you lady spirit."</i>

1405
01:41:32,833 --> 01:41:36,083
<i>"You spoiled my suicide mission, so let's hit it."</i>

1406
01:41:36,167 --> 01:41:38,917
<i>"I am threatening you, now come on."</i>

1407
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,875
<i>"Let's fight it out, now come on."</i>

1408
01:41:41,958 --> 01:41:45,750
<i>"Come on. Come on. Come on you lady spirit."</i>

1409
01:41:46,208 --> 01:41:48,417
<i>"Run for your lives, run for your lives."</i>

1410
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:49,875
<i>"Come on! Come on!"</i>

1411
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:50,583
<i>"Come on!"</i>

1412
01:41:50,708 --> 01:41:52,167
<i>"Come on! Come on!"</i>

1413
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:56,083
The spirit has already arrived you fool, stop it!

1414
01:42:06,458 --> 01:42:08,000
So you finally came.

1415
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:11,708
I was just kidding...

1416
01:42:12,042 --> 01:42:14,792
...and you took it seriously?

1417
01:42:15,125 --> 01:42:17,375
Do you like me that much!

1418
01:42:20,417 --> 01:42:23,708
This is not placed here to threaten you.

1419
01:42:23,792 --> 01:42:25,292
But to bash myself up.

1420
01:42:25,375 --> 01:42:26,417
See.

1421
01:42:28,542 --> 01:42:34,625
All these offerings are for you. Why don't you relax and have it.

1422
01:42:34,792 --> 01:42:36,750
Meanwhile you could have a nice chat with Jack.

1423
01:42:36,833 --> 01:42:39,042
I will be back soon, sister!

1424
01:43:55,125 --> 01:43:58,958
I'm unable to hold her hands and tell my love for her.

1425
01:43:59,750 --> 01:44:01,167
You know how she used to be...

1426
01:44:01,583 --> 01:44:03,458
...and now seems to be like a retard.

1427
01:44:03,667 --> 01:44:04,917
Poor Girl! Poor Girl!

1428
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:08,125
No one should suffer like this.

1429
01:44:08,208 --> 01:44:09,875
So tell what should we do now?

1430
01:44:09,958 --> 01:44:11,167
Let's talk.

1431
01:44:11,250 --> 01:44:12,208
Dude.

1432
01:44:12,292 --> 01:44:13,958
You can do crazy stuffs when you are high...

1433
01:44:14,417 --> 01:44:15,667
...but talking to a spirit isn't a good idea!

1434
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:17,625
I have made up my mind today!

1435
01:44:17,917 --> 01:44:19,708
Is it either me or the spirit.

1436
01:44:19,875 --> 01:44:21,000
- Don't take a hasty decision.. hey! - I won't spare her.

1437
01:44:21,208 --> 01:44:22,292
Spirit.

1438
01:44:23,042 --> 01:44:25,542
- Here it is. So here you are. - Kathir.

1439
01:44:26,042 --> 01:44:27,417
- Get up. - What?

1440
01:44:38,042 --> 01:44:40,417
What is your problem?

1441
01:44:44,708 --> 01:44:46,833
Do you have any idea how she used to be?

1442
01:44:47,750 --> 01:44:49,292
I came here to die.

1443
01:44:51,083 --> 01:44:52,708
but she prevented me from doing so.

1444
01:44:53,917 --> 01:44:57,375
I want to marry her and lead a happy life.

1445
01:44:58,292 --> 01:45:00,125
Aren't you also a woman?

1446
01:45:00,208 --> 01:45:03,792
Can't you see that you are spoiling her life?

1447
01:45:06,125 --> 01:45:08,125
You could just kill her instead.

1448
01:45:12,667 --> 01:45:15,958
Are you upset that you are unable to touch Nisha?

1449
01:45:17,333 --> 01:45:22,792
In front of my eyes. My Shiva was thrashed by 5 of them.

1450
01:45:32,958 --> 01:45:33,750
All set?

1451
01:45:35,583 --> 01:45:36,625
First kiss...

1452
01:45:37,208 --> 01:45:38,250
...after marriage.

1453
01:45:38,583 --> 01:45:39,625
Isn't it very special?

1454
01:45:40,042 --> 01:45:41,958
These are moments that will never come again.

1455
01:45:42,292 --> 01:45:43,250
Hence--

1456
01:45:54,208 --> 01:45:55,333
Who are you?

1457
01:46:01,958 --> 01:46:03,208
Who are you all?

1458
01:46:06,375 --> 01:46:07,917
Aren't you listening?

1459
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:16,375
- Leave me. - Leave her.

1460
01:46:16,708 --> 01:46:17,458
Leave her.

1461
01:46:18,708 --> 01:46:20,458
Shiva.

1462
01:46:29,667 --> 01:46:30,792
Shruthi.

1463
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:40,875
Leave me.

1464
01:46:44,667 --> 01:46:45,875
Shruthi.

1465
01:46:51,042 --> 01:46:52,250
Leave me please.

1466
01:47:00,792 --> 01:47:02,417
Please don't!

1467
01:47:08,292 --> 01:47:10,000
Shiva.

1468
01:47:23,833 --> 01:47:25,792
Shiva.

1469
01:47:35,042 --> 01:47:36,042
Shruthi.

1470
01:47:49,833 --> 01:47:52,000
- Leave me please. - Please don't.

1471
01:48:14,708 --> 01:48:16,917
Shiva!

1472
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:44,167
How are we going to find them?

1473
01:48:44,333 --> 01:48:45,750
We don't even know who they are.

1474
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,625
There is no other way we could save Nisha.

1475
01:48:47,792 --> 01:48:48,833
It's not just that!

1476
01:48:48,917 --> 01:48:51,042
Many like Shruthi and Shiva have died here.

1477
01:48:51,542 --> 01:48:53,625
Why don't we inform the police?

1478
01:48:53,708 --> 01:48:55,417
Do you think they are unaware of this?

1479
01:48:57,208 --> 01:48:58,625
We came here with a plan to die.

1480
01:48:58,667 --> 01:49:00,542
but now we have a reason to live...

1481
01:49:02,333 --> 01:49:04,958
...all we have to do is get them here, the rest Shruthi will ensure.

1482
01:49:05,208 --> 01:49:07,458
Neither we know them nor the place they come from.

1483
01:49:07,542 --> 01:49:09,958
- How are you going to find? - It happens here regularly.

1484
01:49:10,583 --> 01:49:12,667
They must be some guys from the local.

1485
01:49:13,375 --> 01:49:13,958
Karuppu.

1486
01:49:14,125 --> 01:49:17,542
- Where were you when this happened? - I was out of town.

1487
01:49:17,875 --> 01:49:20,125
Watchman, being owner's friend, let everyone...

1488
01:49:20,292 --> 01:49:22,458
...inside and passed out without giving any heed.

1489
01:49:22,708 --> 01:49:24,583
Did you notice anything after you returned?

1490
01:49:24,792 --> 01:49:25,875
Did you see anything?

1491
01:49:26,417 --> 01:49:29,083
The cops had cleared the place by then...

1492
01:49:29,625 --> 01:49:30,792
...so I guess there is nothing.

1493
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:33,458
Wait.

1494
01:49:33,542 --> 01:49:35,958
There was a mobile phone in the swimming pool.

1495
01:49:37,167 --> 01:49:40,250
I tried using it but since it was in the pool, it didn't work.

1496
01:49:40,833 --> 01:49:41,708
Bring that mobile.

1497
01:49:50,917 --> 01:49:54,000
these are moments that will never come again, hence--

1498
01:50:13,042 --> 01:50:16,375
He is from this locality, works at the petrol bunk.

1499
01:50:16,542 --> 01:50:17,375
His name is Mani.

1500
01:50:17,583 --> 01:50:20,917
He always hangs out with his friends in the local tea shop.

1501
01:50:23,125 --> 01:50:25,083
We are going to bring them here today.

1502
01:50:27,583 --> 01:50:28,667
Darling.

1503
01:50:28,958 --> 01:50:31,375
This wig suits you better than the other one.

1504
01:50:31,792 --> 01:50:34,083
Could you please help me locate this address?

1505
01:50:34,167 --> 01:50:34,917
Show me.

1506
01:50:36,208 --> 01:50:39,583
This seems to be the famous haunted house. Why are you headed there?

1507
01:50:40,125 --> 01:50:40,750
Whatever.

1508
01:50:40,792 --> 01:50:43,333
Head straight, you will find a petrol bunk.

1509
01:50:43,792 --> 01:50:46,250
Take left as soon as you cross that, you will find a dead end.

1510
01:50:46,583 --> 01:50:48,542
The last house on the left is the place.

1511
01:50:52,917 --> 01:50:54,042
Here you go.

1512
01:50:54,250 --> 01:50:57,625
Oh that left. Okay. Thank you!

1513
01:51:08,458 --> 01:51:10,167
I hope there won't be any usual problems.

1514
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:13,000
I noticed. They don't look threatening.

1515
01:51:13,167 --> 01:51:15,333
Why get into unnecessary mess?

1516
01:51:15,667 --> 01:51:17,833
Didn't the inspector ask us to be quiet for 3 months.

1517
01:51:17,917 --> 01:51:18,958
Don't worry, we'll handle.

1518
01:51:19,333 --> 01:51:22,167
Don't worry. Isn't it the same house?

1519
01:51:22,708 --> 01:51:26,083
Last time around it was relishing, will this be as good as that?

1520
01:51:26,250 --> 01:51:28,375
This would be even better.

1521
01:51:28,667 --> 01:51:31,625
My wig is far better when compared to this one...

1522
01:51:31,792 --> 01:51:33,833
...this one is quite irritating.

1523
01:51:34,917 --> 01:51:39,500
Imagine their lust if they will show up, considering you a woman.

1524
01:51:39,667 --> 01:51:40,917
Let them come today...

1525
01:51:41,583 --> 01:51:42,583
...they'll be gone for good.

1526
01:51:43,375 --> 01:51:43,917
Dude.

1527
01:51:44,333 --> 01:51:45,750
I hope you have informed Nisha.

1528
01:51:45,917 --> 01:51:46,917
I have.

1529
01:51:47,208 --> 01:51:49,750
But she seems to depressed. Why don't you talk to her.

1530
01:51:53,917 --> 01:51:55,208
Okay.

1531
01:51:56,792 --> 01:51:58,333
Don't you worry.

1532
01:51:59,167 --> 01:52:01,292
Let them come here today.

1533
01:52:01,542 --> 01:52:02,833
See what I'll do to them.

1534
01:52:02,917 --> 01:52:04,375
You better be careful.

1535
01:52:04,875 --> 01:52:07,292
Kindly change this disguise! Horrible!

1536
01:52:10,125 --> 01:52:11,125
Nisha.

1537
01:52:18,875 --> 01:52:20,500
Everything will come to an end today.

1538
01:52:21,833 --> 01:52:23,167
We'll get married soon.

1539
01:52:23,958 --> 01:52:25,917
Our lives are going to change.

1540
01:52:26,292 --> 01:52:28,792
I don't think this will end.

1541
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:34,042
I can't trouble you further.

1542
01:52:37,750 --> 01:52:40,125
What have you done Nisha? Have you gone crazy?

1543
01:52:40,667 --> 01:52:42,458
I couldn't think of anything else Kathir.

1544
01:52:42,542 --> 01:52:43,083
Nisha.

1545
01:52:50,750 --> 01:52:51,792
Nisha.

1546
01:53:06,042 --> 01:53:07,000
Kumaran.

1547
01:53:08,708 --> 01:53:10,500
Where are you guys?

1548
01:53:14,583 --> 01:53:16,125
Oh!

1549
01:53:18,917 --> 01:53:20,167
Kumaran.

1550
01:53:21,125 --> 01:53:22,458
Leave him alone.

1551
01:53:38,917 --> 01:53:40,750
Leave her.

1552
01:53:44,333 --> 01:53:45,750
Leave her.

1553
01:55:21,292 --> 01:55:22,458
Shiva.

1554
01:55:28,167 --> 01:55:29,917
Shiva.

1555
01:55:48,292 --> 01:55:49,583
Shiva.

1556
01:56:22,583 --> 01:56:23,833
Shiva.

1557
01:58:13,375 --> 01:58:14,792
Shiva.

1558
01:58:17,917 --> 01:58:19,667
Hey!

1559
01:58:36,083 --> 01:58:37,875
Hey!

1560
01:58:59,625 --> 01:59:00,792
Shiva.

1561
02:00:00,292 --> 02:00:01,750
Shiva.

1562
02:00:11,958 --> 02:00:13,250
Shiva.

1563
02:00:44,708 --> 02:00:47,958
So finally completed that kiss.

1564
02:01:30,667 --> 02:01:32,042
Hey.
