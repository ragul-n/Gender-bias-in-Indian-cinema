Here my desires have
drowned in water.

54
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,855
Speaking of water.

55
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,590
I feel like spraying a bit myself.

Why a bit? Relieve
yourself completely.

57
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:14,824

Keep it there.

132
00:08:58,504 --> 00:08:59,710

133
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,178
Come. Come.

134
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,745
Come on. Come on.

135
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:13,058
I hope the camera is not on.

136
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,999
I am quite afraid of these things.

137
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,503
Just joking.

138
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,662
Come Let's talk about work.

139
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:27,109
What I am going to
tell you is top secret.

140
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:33,683
You know that infiltration
is a serious matter.

141
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,112
And our neighbors
are not giving it up.

142
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,951
We have information
that after 2 days..

143
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:47,263
..War is going to declared on
the border of India and Pakistan.

144
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:53,403
And our American spy has told us..

145
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:56,598
..That China is going
to help Pakistan..

146
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,606
..So that Pakistan can
strike a nuclear attack on us.

147
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:05,039
But there's no need to be afraid?
We have America's full support.

148
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,883
So what I want from you is to come with
me to the border with me right now..

00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:15,685
..And make up such a report that not
just our soldiers feel motivated..

150
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:19,986
..But also the entire country
feels a surge of patriotism.

151
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:20,995
Only ...with a slight twist.

152
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:27,794
You have to show this report as live
on your channel but after 2 days.

153
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,463
When war has been declared.

154
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,904
You know well.. Who'll go
there in a war situation?

155
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,077
You understood.. right?

156
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,748

00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,431
Yeah ..we'll Keep it in a museum.
- What?

180
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,705
Neither It's going to work
nor I want to make it work.

181
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,207
We don't want to fight
at all. What is this?

182
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:17,972
What's this fatty blabbering?

183
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,113
I can smell rebellion in you words.

184
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,091
Wow... Great! you
better not talk of smell.

185
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,457
Empty stomachs don't smell of
roses they smell of gas only.

186
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,922
And don't forget This is Pakistan.

187
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:37,560
Here, Generals don't take permission
from ministers for rebellion.

188
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,464
Understood?

189
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,630
Then tell me. What's the problem?

190
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:41,500
Problem?

191
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:43,803
Problem is the food for Army.

192
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,910
Your lentil meat has
neither lentil nor meat.

193
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:50,513
I swear if anyone can find it,
I'll give him half of Pakistan.

194
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,611
War is not fought
on an empty-stomach.

195
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,742
Nowadays our soldiers are passing
less of intelligence and more of gas.

196
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:57,887
What is this?

197
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,514
General Sir, this
won't be tolerated here.

198
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,355
How come it won't be tolerated?

199
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:04,884
I will tell you what is this!

200
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,223
Guru!

201
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:10,028
If you fight here, who will
fight at the border.. you Pappy?

202
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:11,824
The tell him.
- Hey!

203
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:15,862
From now on we will
provide you food too.

204
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,139
Look at this.
- Note down the order.

205
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,438
Chicken Chilly.
Chicken cottage-cheese.

206
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,412
Chicken Manchurian.
Chicken dish. For Pakistani army.

207
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:34,615
Soldiersl. Oye ..Speak to me.

208
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:41,055
Just because you got new uniforms.
you won't listen to me.

209
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:49,666
Soldiers. Speak to me.

210
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,432
Sir, sir.

211
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,636
Where is Qureshi?
- I don't know Sir.

212
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,675
Speak to me. Where is Qureshi?
- I don't know.

213
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,448
Why is he riding the camel?

214
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,884
Waal-ey-kum-Salam.

215
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:14,726
Salam
Waal-ey-kum Sir.

216
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:19,568
Fine, But where were
you, Captain Qureshi?

217
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,265
Had gone to arrange for water.

218
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,899
Why to arrange for water?

219
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,337
With just two bottles of water, you
can either drink it or wash 'it'.

220
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,137
Wiping with sand for so long
Out 'it's have gone sore.

221
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,778
See Hameed for example.

222
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,509
He reeks so much that he
can't sleep the whole night.

223
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,849
Yes, sir.
- Quiet.

224
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:38,351
You moron.

225
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,183
At least he is protecting
the country by staying awake.

226
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:47,564
Protecting? sir? When people
keep dogs for protection..

227
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,997
..They at least feed them well.

228
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,323
Who cares us? We're just
managing with God's grace.

229
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,069
What are you doing here? Go there.

230
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,866
Oh my! What was I saying? Yes.

231
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,999
My Soldiers.

232
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:06,282
It's said "if you want to
swim, swim in the ocean".

233
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,883
What's there in ponds?

234
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:09,850
Qureshi!
- Sir! Sir! Very good!

235
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:14,420
And If you want to love, then
love me. What's there in women?

236
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:15,151
Sir!.

237
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:16,860
What happened?
Did I forget the verse.

238
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,792
Its 'Country'.
- Oh!

239
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:25,458
If you want to love, love your
country. What's there in women?

240
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:28,333
All of you, I mean, even me.

241
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:33,135
I mean, God has created
all of us for this day only.

242
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,906
By now we have been born
a thousand times, sir.

243
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:40,748
Qureshi, if you are born just
once more, what will we lose?

244
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,276
We may not, sir but Our
mothers will lose a lot.

245
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:49,687
Speak to me. Yes. So, friends,
tomorrow ..War is to be declared.

246
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,456
Congratulations!

247
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,424
Oh Damn it! Again?

248
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:57,392
Again? What do you mean 'again'?

249
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,227
If there is a war,
what will you lose?

250
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:05,039
So soldiers, war..

251
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,868
Damn it! You have
dampened my spirit totally.

252
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,914
Sir, he means to say if
we keep on waging war..

253
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,450
..Our country will
disappear from the map.

254
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,743
Discovery and National Geography
will show programs like.

255
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:19,386
"Once upon a time
there was a Pakistan

256
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,302
Hello.
- Yes, Rut, tell me.

257
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,432
Sakshi, guess where I am.

258
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:38,969
Where? I don't know.

259
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,266
God! It's my dream come true.

260
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:45,041
I am at the border, dear.
- Border?

261
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,448
Oh my God! Really?

262
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,220
Handsome handsome soldiers?

263
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,552
Yeah ..Very handsome Sit.

264
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,149
You are so lucky.
- Madam.. time!

265
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,924
Now that Your dream
has come true, madam.

266
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,660
Did you find your dream man too?

267
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:04,733
Hello.

268
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,265
I am asking you. Tell me.

269
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,541
Hello, Rut. Where did you
disappear? Tell me something.

270
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,144
You started searching for him?
Yeah ...I'll find him too.

271
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,853
Are you searching for something?

272
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,013
No. I..

273
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,914
Sakshi, I will call you back.

274
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,816
Hi. Captain Rajveer Singh Rana.

275
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,184
Rut Dutta.

276
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,159
But you can call me ..Rut.

277
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,422
I'll call you madam.

278
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:40,194
By the way, besides you nobody else
knows about the minister's visit.

279
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:43,469
Our Defense Minister has
done PhD in media management.

280
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,207
He only brought us here.

281
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,505
Sorry to disappoint you.

282
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,675
It's a pleasure to be
disappointed by you.

283
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,914
And as the commanding officer
your safety is my first duty.

284
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,912
If you need anything in
this dangerous place, please.

285
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,884
I don't need you. But
the minister needs you.

286
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,385
Yeah. Right. I'll see you.

287
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:03,791
These are the two Forward posts.

288
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,620
Very good.
- These are our watchtowers, sir.

289
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,895
Ranjeet.

290
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,928
VerY QOOd. Very good.

291
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:10,825
Very good.

292
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,067
Hello, Captain Raj.

293
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,201
Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind. Jai Hind.

294
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,362
Sorry, sir. I was patrolling. 50..
- No problem.

295
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:21,207
Sir, any special reason for
coming to this desert suddenly?

296
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,210
Well ...what do I
tell you, Captain?

297
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,642
I feel so patriotic
when I come here.

298
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:27,781
But what do I do?

299
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,883
I don't get much time
from my work in Delhi.

300
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,915
So I thought I will
come personally and see..

301
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:35,048
..What arrangements you have
done for the safety of the border.

302
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,925
Sure, sir. Come, sir.
This way please. Come.

303
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:39,120
Thanks. Thanks.

304
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,731
It won't be good from there.

305
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,633
Come in the front.
Come in the front.

306
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,036
Yes. Come.

307
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,771
That's better.

308
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,970
So that the photo of our
country's brave soldiers..

309
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:54,768
..Is taken from the front.

310
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,335
Okay, sir.

311
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:02,445
You need not be afraid.

312
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,685
Sir? Afraid?

313
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:12,557
I mean, if the enemy army
has taken a wrong step..

314
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,955
..We are ready to give
them a fitting reply.

315
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,932
What wrong step, sir?
They haven't taken any step.

316
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:22,970
I want to say that we
are not afraid of anyone.

317
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,974
I have come to the
border to show you that..

318
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,637
..Whether bullets or cannons
are fired at the border..

319
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,045
He is scaring as if we're going to
war tomorrow...we won't back off.

320
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:33,776
True.
- Jai Hind.

321
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:38,583
Sir, this bunker goes very far.

322
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:39,922
Yes.

323
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,515
Who is he?

324
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,156
What's the news, friend?

325
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:57,840
Sir, the infiltrators were trying
to enter through location 'Sawant'.

326
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,837
I gave them some rockets to eat.

327
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:03,209
They're lying with their behinds facing
the sky. - lnfiltrators? Behinds?

328
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,448
What is he saying?
- Sir, he is our spy.

329
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,278
He is an expert in stopping
infiltrators at location 'Sawant'.

330
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:12,481
Location Sawant. I knew that.
I was just saying that..

331
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:13,316
Hey!

332
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,257
Captain, what was that?

333
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:20,297
Sir, this is the border.
firing starts anytime.

334
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:23,763
I see. Seems I have got
lots of information now.

335
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,936
Let's go. Come on.

336
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,801
And of course I have
to file that report too.

337
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:29,503
Look, do one thing.

338
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:32,806
Why don't you give me the cassette.
I'll send it to the channel.

339
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,442
You know how important it
is to send this cassette.

340
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,012
Yadav. -Yes, sir.
- Take the cassette.

341
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:38,909
Give me the cassette.
- Cassette.

342
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,011
Come on.
- Sir, stop. Where are you going?

343
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,609
Don't you want to go further?
- Come on. Jai Hind.

344
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:45,416
Minister, listen. I've seen enough

345
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,892
Rocket? Bullets?
- Come on. Let's go.

346
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:50,991
You didn't go Ms Datta?

347
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:52,889
You are very daring.

348
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,287
I have come to the
border for the first time.

349
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:56,989
I will cover
everything and then go

350
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,059
There are many
bachelors in our army.

351
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,728
It seems you need to cover too.

352
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:06,400
Come on. Let's give these infiltrators
a taste of Rajasthan's sand.

353
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,501
What rubbish are you talking?
What nonsense!

354
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,745
Yeah ..that's what I
said .. it's a male goat.

355
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,649
But Abdul said it's a female goat.

356
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:17,581
Have you consumed opium?
Indian army is coming for you.

357
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,086
Yes, sir. Army.
- Escape!

358
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,981
Yes. Okay, sir.

359
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,824
Get up. The enemy army is coming.

360
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,090
We'll be shot.

361
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,765
Hey! They are fleeing.

362
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,733
Chase them till they
reach their relatives.

363
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,942
How come the minister
suddenly paid a visit?

364
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:41,333
Something seems fishy.

365
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,976
What fishy? He can come
without any reason too.

366
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,039
Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind.

367
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,347
What do you feel, Khatri? Relax.

368
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,119
The minister came for an outing?

369
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,815
Sir, without a reason they won't
come from their mother's womb.

370
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,483
There's more to it.
- Correct, officer.

371
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,322
Oh... please Come.

372
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,091
Everyone make your
appearance proper.

373
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,229
Now that Madam is
free from the minister.

374
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,364
Seems like she wants
to shoot us now.

375
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,498
Come on everyone!
Madam wants to shoot us.

376
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:09,195
Everybody come.

377
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,431
Everyone make your
appearance proper.

378
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,770
And form a queue quickly.

379
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,866
Yes, sir.

380
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:19,347
So finally, madam, shoot
these young Studs too.

381
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:20,873
Madam.

382
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:22,851
Shoot me too.

383
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,518
Madam, shoot me too.

384
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,586
Madam, me too.

385
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:26,812
Madam, I am also there.

386
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:31,294
Madam, shoot us.
Shoot us. Shoot us.

387
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,551
Fine.

388
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,499
But I can shoot with this too.

389
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,501
Oh my! Lady Dyanamite!

390
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,461
Don't worry. I won't miss my aim.

391
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,800
Wow! You have a good
sense of humor too.

392
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:49,735
For your information, I am a
national games shooting champion.

393
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,275
Impressed.

394
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,311
You heard?
- Yes, sir.

395
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,283
Amazing!
- Thank you.

396
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,076
Okay, tell me, Captain Raj.

397
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:59,923
How do you find out that
there is going to be a war?

398
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,284
I mean, when do you
get the information?

399
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:04,321
There is no need
for the information.

400
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,954
If they hurl a brick, we
too throw a few stones.

401
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:12,490
So there must be a tense
atmosphere at the border, right?

402
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,962
Yes. There is tension.

403
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:17,432
But you need to make an
effort to lighten the tension.

404
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:20,174
What do you mean?

405
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:23,802
I mean to say, do you want
to see a tense situation?

406
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:26,780
What?
- Hold on.

407
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,949
Lieutenant Khatri.
- Yes, sir.

408
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,052
Madam wants to see the tension.
- No.

409
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:32,219
Make the arrangement.
- No.

410
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,278
Okay, sir.
- What are you saying?

411
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,722
No. It's okay. You
have come so far here.

412
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,054
So see what tension means.

413
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,957
Captain Raj, I was just
-just 2 minutes.

414
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,189
And you'll see the tension.
- No.

415
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:40,252
See it. No problem.

416
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,523
Khatri, hurry up.
- here, sir.

417
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,504
Salam waal-ey-kum
Qureshi.

418
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,686
Ok then ...Captain! Qureshi.

419
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:18,462
Waal-ey-kum
Captain.

420
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,601
So what did you
get for lunch today?

421
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,940
Yeah you'll kill us if you
keep asking us this question.

422
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,971
You won't even have to fire.

423
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:31,545
Still, tell me buddy. You found
anything in lentil meat today?

424
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:34,740
Yeah right ...we got some steamy
sizzles in this lentil meat.

425
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,116
Why don't you bring
your bowl and join us.

426
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:39,514
It's okay. never mind.
You'll see some good days too.

427
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:42,616
Every Pakistani
soldier has his day.

428
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:45,025
So you may think as
if it is that day.

429
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,231
So you found a bride, after all.

430
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,128
Captain, I have told
you so many times.

431
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,501
Don't joke about my
marriage and future bride.

432
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,698
No offence... Hats off to you man.

433
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,736
It took so long getting
your five sisters' married.

434
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:02,074
That you've grown as old as
their ages added together.

435
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,272
Still God hasn't shown mercy.

436
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,573
Yeah, humor me Captain.

437
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,116
But remember one thing.

438
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:17,156
The day I find my girl,
your eyes will pop out.

439
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:18,894
Why are you scaring me?

440
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,126
Are you marrying a
girl or a missile?

441
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:24,628
But just check your
launcher before you get her.

442
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:27,802
It might misfire like
your other launchers.

443
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:30,266
Tension not, Captain.

444
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:34,942
The launchers you are
talking about were foreign.

445
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:39,315
This launcher is
100% made in Pakistan.

446
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:43,413
Once it fires, it will
surely make a blast.

447
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:46,612
Never mind. How is Commander Khan?

448
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:51,058
Why did you mention this
moron during lunchtime?

449
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:55,193
He has got cold. So he
has gone to the doctor.

450
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:58,232
Must be coming.
I will leave now. Goodbye.

451
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,764
Or else I won't have anything
left to eat from this.

452
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,698
Okay. Fine. Goodbye.

453
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:10,377
Do you think it's a free meal
camp? You have come like beggars.

454
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,081
I am very hungry Sir.

455
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:14,483
So you saw the tension madam?

456
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:15,983
I am shocked.

457
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:19,447
You guys... have such a relation.

458
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:21,448
Madam, war has its own place.

459
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,054
Whether this side or that
side, both are humans.

460
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:27,323
It's the bond of humanity.

461
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,060
So Captain Raj, do you
think there should be war?

462
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,361
No. Especially not with them.

463
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,466
Poor guys are starving to death.

464
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,263
And then we start firing on them?

465
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:42,043
Rather, I want to invite
them for a supper someday.

466
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:46,042
As it is, who has
gained anything from war?

467
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:50,409
Profits. Huge profits.

468
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:52,553
For you.

469
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,282
Now here's the deal.

470
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,760
We give you the arms and the
ammunition. We support you.

471
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:00,726
I told you. Don't think about it.
That's the condition.

472
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:04,561
Mr. Shawn, 5 billion dollars?

473
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:10,069
Please, Mr. Shawn.. - Hey!
I gave you 20% off for Thanksgiving.

474
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:13,438
You guys go out there and
spend millions and millions..

475
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:15,910
..And millions on those
commonwealth games.

476
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:19,372
And you can't come up
with 5 billion for war?

477
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:25,521
I know what. Maybe you can slice
a little bit off your commission.

478
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:26,782
No deduction from commission, sir.

479
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:29,655
My commission is fixed. Fixed.

480
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:31,560
Please, sir..
- What do you mean please?

481
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,027
What do you mean please?

482
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,854
There is no option.

483
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,158
Come on.

484
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:41,131
Mr. Shawn.

485
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,996
Hey! Hey! Hey!

486
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,469
Please.

487
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:49,510
Now we are talking.
Now we are talking.

488
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:53,813
Well, my little chocolate chiquita.

489
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:59,984
Here's what. You guys
can get the guns on EMI.

490
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,820
We will do it, sir. Yes, sir.

491
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,451
We will do it, sir.
- Thank you.

492
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:10,228
Okay. We give you
guys the guns and ammo.

493
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:12,863
Free of charge.

494
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:18,130
You guys give us an airbase
in the Sindh province.

495
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:22,539
I swear. such bad
English He speaks.

496
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:24,775
What is he saying?

497
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,072
He wants an airbase
in the Sindh province.

498
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:29,114
An airbase in the Sindh province?

499
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:32,550
Leave alone Airbase?..
Make a racecourse.

500
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:34,454
Thank you. Thank you.
- Not just Sindh.

501
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,389
Make it in Pakistan.
- What nonsense are you talking?

502
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:40,123
What is this?
- General, try to understand.

503
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,089
Do you want the same Lentil
Meat for your whole life?

504
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,528
No no. you Talk.

505
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:46,796
Excuse me. Sir. Sir.

506
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:51,405
We want little more money.

507
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,601
What! You got to be kidding!

508
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,136
I just gave 2 billion
dollars in aids.

509
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:58,977
AIDS? No. Here, no one has AIDS.

510
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,550
Not AIDS, you idiot. Aid. Aid.

511
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,417
2 billion dollars on aids.
- He is asking what you did..

512
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:05,921
..With the money he
gave you recently.

513
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,686
General, you know the
condition of the country.

514
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,760
Explain that to him.

515
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:15,897
He still needs money. More money.

516
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:16,829
You...

517
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:19,967
Alright. Alright. Alright.

518
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:20,934
Take the money.

519
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,902
See? He agreed.

520
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:26,241
He called you beggar too. Beggars.

521
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:31,507
Soldiers, madam wants to see
how much we toil for our country.

522
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,850
Shall we show?
- Yes, sir.

523
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:35,715
Is everyone ready?
- Yes, sir.

524
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,946
Good. So start the drill.

525
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:42,352
Put in so much effort that we can
hear the enemy trembling from here.

526
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:47,626
Qureshi. Qureshi.

527
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,830
Qureshi, what are you doing?

528
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:52,892
Are you keeping a watch on
the enemy or staring at women?

529
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,403
Quiet. The enemy army
is conducting war drill.

530
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:58,332
Bill? What bill? What
bill is to be paid?

531
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:03,170
Sir this one drill is very
dangerous. Very dangerous.

532
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:05,410
It'll tear things apart.

533
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,410
Why're you scaring us Qureshi?

534
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,216
For your aunts sake ...tell me.
What's so dangerous?

535
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,252
Sir.
- Yes.

536
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:17,085
Passing beneath the 'Taare'(Stars).
- You kidding me Qureshi?

537
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,424
From where do I bring stars
from in this afternoon?

538
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,757
Yeah why don't we take
it out from the flag, sir.

539
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:24,096
I mean 'taare', wires. Wires.

540
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,599
Oh ..that's not much Listen
you Idiot, I have some work.

541
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:30,070
What Sir?
- I will tell you... Come.

542
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:33,404
Soldiers.
- Yes, sir.

543
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:36,308
It's a very easy job.

544
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:41,280
You have to crawl beneath
these wires and reach there.

545
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:42,876
Sir, aren't the wires too low?

546
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:44,909
First enter, make an
effort you lazy bones.

547
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,080
Bend and crawl You moron.

548
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:48,053
Bend your neck.

549
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:51,988
Martyrs of the country,
you have no one.

550
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,825
But if you keep
crawling like this..

551
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:58,125
..One day Pakistanis will
eat chickpeas in Delhi.

552
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,200
Very good. My brave soldiers.

553
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:03,102
Sir, your grasp shouldn't
exceed your reach.

554
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:07,602
Write my message on each grain.

555
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:09,236
Have mercy Sir.
- Oh God! - Sir.

556
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:13,908
If you have a pen, write
Pakistan on their coffin.

557
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:14,609
Very good.

558
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,347
Man, he does he always have to
rhyme about death and martyrdom.

559
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:19,820
Come on. Stand up.

560
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,290
So how was it?

561
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:30,498
Brother, no one would recognize
us in these clothes ...right?

562
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,533
But that goatherd
recognized us Brother.

563
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:34,100
Don't remind me
about that Scoundrel.

564
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:37,866
That idiot took our weapons.

565
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:40,408
Do you know how mortified I was?

566
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,200
I feel like crying
when I think of it.

567
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:44,843
If I meet him again,
I won't spare him.

568
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:45,938
Found him.

569
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,547
Hey goatherd.

570
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,619
Who are you?
- Who are you?

571
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:56,523
My name is Soorma Bhopali.

572
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,352
Who are you?
- Soorma Bhopali.

573
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,153
This is not Bhopal and there is
no Soorma (kohl) in your eyes.

574
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:02,558
Who are you?

575
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,822
Wait.. now you'll say
you are a goatherd.

576
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,435
Brother, that one was
also grazing his goat.

577
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:09,232
No, brother. It was a male goat.

578
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,773
You were standing behind.
did you see the bell?

579
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:14,777
Yes, brother. I saw a
bell ...around his neck.

580
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,575
Don't talk nonsense.
You Check his bag.

581
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:21,206
Oh my God! Why do
you take the trouble?

582
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:24,919
I will do it myself.

583
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:29,323
What is this? - It's Soorma (kohl).
It's applied in the eyes.

584
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,394
Hmmm.
- So less grass and a goat.

585
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,321
Is he the same scoundrel?
- No, brother.

586
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:37,329
It was a male goat. I swear on God.

587
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:40,962
Come on. Let's apply his
soorma (kohl) and see.

588
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:44,268
We will find out whether
he is the same man or not.

589
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:48,239
Listen, apply kohl.

590
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,275
Please bend a bit brother.

591
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:56,945
A Pathan never bows in front
of anyone. Don't you know?

592
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,019
Stupid man.

593
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,946
Will you be a donkey
for a while mister?

594
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:02,388
Come on.

595
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,953
Hey! How dare You ask
a Pathan to be a donkey?

596
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:10,023
He won't be a donkey.
He'll be a horse.

597
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:12,865
Be anyone. It's your wish.

598
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:26,981
You fool. What did
you apply in our eyes?

599
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:29,109
Soorma (Kohl).
- You scoundrel.

600
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:32,082
Forget distant objects, I
can't even see the close ones.

601
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,521
Tell me, you scoundrel.
What did you apply?

602
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,626
You applied kohl and made me blind.

603
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:38,820
Where are you going?

604
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,557
Leave my weapons.
Where are you going?

605
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:41,653
It's very nice.

606
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,126
Madam, isn't captain Raj amazing?

607
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:45,359
What do you mean?

608
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:47,763
I mean, what a personality
he has! Very nice.

609
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:49,371
What nice?

610
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:51,739
His personality is not so great.

611
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:55,802
More than the minister and drill
His attention was more on you.

612
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,076
Shut up, Raj. I mean,
shut up, Ranjeet.

613
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,416
Great, madam! Now you can
see Raj in Ranjeet too.

614
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,477
Yes. He was also staring
at you. See the footage.

615
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:06,413
See this.

616
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,047
I told you to change the cassette.

617
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:09,758
I did that already, madam.

618
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,923
But there were plenty of
close-ups of Raj sir, madam.

619
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:28,275
"Your eyes said."

620
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:33,974
"Your eyes said."

621
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:43,892
"Your eyes said."

622
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:46,621
"Your eyes said."

623
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,598
"Your eyes said."

624
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,238
"Your eyes said."

625
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:03,071
"I don't know what with the eyes."

626
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:10,380
"I can't sleep at night."

627
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:13,554
"At night."

628
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:18,490
"I often stay awake."

629
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:21,322
"I often stay awake."

630
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:23,061
Oh my!

631
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:26,926
My God!

632
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,964
My God!

633
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:33,142
Will you just stop
taking God's name?

634
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:35,177
And tell me what you
are seeing, Qureshi?

635
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:38,272
Marvelous!

636
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:45,786
"You have cast a big spell on me."

637
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:51,487
Qureshi, all this seems a
master plan to destroy Pakistan.

638
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:02,933
"Your eyes said."

639
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:08,577
"Your eyes said."

640
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:27,727
"What is in me that you like?"

641
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:33,302
"is what You asked
me in the beginning."

642
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:39,174
"When I look at
you, lfeel lively."

643
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:45,377
"is what I replied."

644
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:50,977
"Forget it. Don't tell tall tales."

645
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:56,815
"When did I say that?"

646
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:02,726
"Don't tease me."
- this Jaat is talking a lot.

647
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:07,235
My sweetheart. I have loved.

648
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,529
And you are flirting with her.

649
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:14,104
"Now stop it."

650
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:19,748
"You have cast a big spell on me."

651
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,915
"I often stay awake."

652
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:26,018
"I often stay awake."

653
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:31,388
"You have cast a big spell on me."

654
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,460
He must have said something.

655
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:38,191
He is acting too
smart. I will show him.

656
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,131
And now there is no need
to look for a girl too.

657
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,134
Oh I see. So you've got a girl?

658
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:48,968
Yes. I have. But it is
just that once, I want..

659
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:54,411
"I am a young blooded
Jaat. Mad and insane."

660
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:55,877
What was that?

661
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,986
I see, Qureshi. Is that it?

662
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,611
Come on, madam, it's time
to give an answer. Come on.

663
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:04,155
Answer?
- Come on, madam, come with me.

664
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:05,125
Come on..
- Hey!

665
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,664
"I am a young blooded
Jaat. Mad and insane."

666
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:14,460
"I am a young blooded
Jaat. Mad and insane."

667
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:17,732
"Oh Lord. I didn't realize
such a small thing."

668
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:18,896
"That.."

669
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,967
"She loves me."

670
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,372
"And she is crazy about me."

671
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:25,442
"Hey!"

672
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:28,846
"She loves me."

673
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:32,453
"And she is crazy about me."

674
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:37,216
Hey, Captain Qureshi. Since
when did you become a Jaat?

675
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:40,528
Yes, you do seem mad and insane.

676
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,658
And just understand one point.

677
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:47,029
She doesn't love you. She loves me.

678
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:48,468
Did you understand or not?

679
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,063
What are you saying Raj?

680
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:53,003
No, no, don't worry. It was
just to make him keep quiet.

681
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:54,701
But the rest is your wish.

682
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:57,880
Hey, Captain, why are you
getting so upset, brother?

683
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:59,381
Why are you getting so emotional?

684
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,417
I had just started
Antakshari(game of songs).

685
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,376
We have stopped at H.
now sing a song with H.

686
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:06,111
Is that it, my friend?

687
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:09,357
Very smart? but never mind.

688
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:11,559
Come on, brothers. We are
beginning with Antakshari.

689
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:13,255
Come on, everyone.

690
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,857
Now listen to a song
that starts with H.

691
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:16,760
A song with H.

692
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,858
Sir. Sing your favorite
song with that starts with H.

693
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,569
Yes, sing. Come on, sing the song.

694
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,534
"Hey, Lord has made you.."

695
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:25,129
"So beautiful."

696
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:29,269
"Hey, Lord has made
you so beautiful."

697
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,139
"I feel like looking
at you all the time."

698
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:36,345
"Hey, Lord has made
you so beautiful."

699
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:40,785
"My heart doesn't agree with me.
I tried a lot to reason with it."

700
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:43,456
"I feel like looking
at you all the time."

701
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:47,891
"Hey, Lord has made
you so beautiful."

702
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:52,092
Yes.
- That was great. Now sing with Y.

703
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:56,696
Hey, Captain.

704
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,302
You trapped me at Y again.

705
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,474
Wait, I will think of one.

706
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:04,809
Where can we get songs starting with Y?
- Sir, I know of one.

707
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:06,846
Yes.
- Then go ahead and sing.

708
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,278
"This is a country of
Young and brave men."

709
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:12,684
"Of amazing and incredible men."

710
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,916
"What more do we say
about this country.."

711
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:14,979
"Hey!"

712
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:16,888
"What more can be
said about friends?"

713
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,052
"It's like ajewel on
the face of this world."

714
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:22,663
"Hey!"

715
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:24,691
H..
- H.

716
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:26,733
Come on, we have come to H again.

717
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:29,067
Very good, friend. Very good.

718
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:31,538
You sang a song to mark the
greatness of our country.

719
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:32,732
We are very happy-

720
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,833
Hey, mister.

721
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:37,708
Music and talent don't belong to
any particular country or region.

722
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:40,873
It doesn't have any boundary
and it doesn't belong to anyone.

723
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:44,678
The song you sang before this,
isn't it by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan.

724
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,789
Where is he from?
He is from our country.

725
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:51,951
Wow, my friend. This is the
first time you made sense.

726
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:55,164
H 1. - Hey, wait.
Hey, friends. Sing with H.

727
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:56,994
H 2..
- Hey, sing with H.

728
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:58,459
Hey, wait..
- H 3.

729
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:00,799
Hey, think of something.
- Come on. H4.

730
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:03,198
Hey, wait. I am telling you.
- H5.

731
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:05,568
H6.

732
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:10,840
"Hey, my Lord.."

733
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:16,179
"Please keep evils from my path."

734
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:19,745
"Hey, Lord. Please
accept my prayers."

735
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,752
"Hey, Lord, you are the
one to keep us from evils."

736
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,452
"You are the first
and the foremost Lord."

737
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:24,250
"Hey!"

738
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:27,454
Hey, not just keep you from evils,
we will keep your respect intact.

739
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:30,995
Please accept my invitation!
Oh my Lord. Great!

740
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:35,228
Even you will be amazed that one can
be so loving towards another person.

741
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,999
Wow.
- Wow.

742
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:42,373
"Hey, Lord, you are the
one to keep us from evils."

743
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,705
"You are the first
and the foremost Lord."

744
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,748
"You are the greatest Lord."

745
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:48,748
"You are the number one."

746
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:50,077
R. R, R, R

747
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,688
hoY.

748
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:56,653
Hey! Hey, captain!

749
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:58,861
This is utter cheating on your side.
- Yes, he is right.

750
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:00,963
It stopped on R. Where
did Y come in from?

751
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:02,994
Hey, if you don't know
a song starting with Y..

752
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:05,397
..Then accept the fact
that you have lost.

753
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,734
Hey, I don't accept a defeat...
not even from my father.

754
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:10,094
We'll sing.

755
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:12,907
Y.. - Sing with Y. Sing with Y.
Come on, come on, Y.

756
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:14,904
Y

757
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,976
Hey, what is this? Sing a song.
- I don't remember any song.

758
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:18,842
Y

759
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,681
Yes, yes, count slowly.

760
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:22,851
Y

761
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,083
Hey, farookh. think of something..
- I cannot think of anything.

762
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:27,380
Y4.

763
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:29,184
Y5.
- Y5.

764
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:31,053
Hey, you are counting
too fast, count slowly.

765
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,195
Y 6..
- Come on, think of something idiots.

766
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:35,388
Y

767
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,799
Y

768
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:40,129
Y9.
- Y9.

769
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:42,967
Sir, I know of a song. Can I sing it?
- Yes, go ahead and sing it.

770
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,764
Y9.
- Y9.

771
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,476
Y9.
- Y9.

772
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:49,806
Make it fast, come on.
- Sir, I hope there's no problem.

773
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:51,244
There wouldn't be
any problem. Sing it.

774
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:54,479
"This world.."

775
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,581
"ls a bride."

776
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:59,083
"This world is a bride. A bride."

777
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:02,318
"And this bride's
vermilion dot is."

778
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:04,815
"is my lndia."

779
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:06,259
I love my Ind

780
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,921
Hey! Praise Mother India
- Hail!

781
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:11,724
I love my Ind

782
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:14,129
This is my Ind

783
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:16,363
Hey, after all, you realized
and said it out loud.

784
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:17,870
I love my India!

785
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:19,340
I love my Ind

786
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:21,969
Hey, shut up... shut up you fools!
Stop. Stop it. Stop this song.

787
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,506
You are singing that you love
India. Fools from Chaubakistan.

788
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,277
I love my India indeed. couldn't
you think of anything else?

789
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:31,352
You yourself said it,
sir. Music is music.

790
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,520
It doesn't belong to
any country or region.

791
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,486
So what if I said?

792
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:38,618
Couldn't you ...instead of
India'... sing 'I love my Pakistan

793
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,121
But it wouldn't have rhymed, sir.

794
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:41,288
Hey, are you so concerned
about rhyming it?

795
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:42,558
Were you born out of a poet?

796
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:45,431
Are you on their
side or ours? Tell me.

797
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,369
For the last 32 years, I'm still
looking for this answer sir.

798
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:53,036
Maternal family is in India. And
paternal side is here in Pakistan.

799
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,669
And I am hanging
in a No man's land.

800
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,077
You tell me sir. Which
side should I be on?

801
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:02,049
It was too much today.
I love my India.

802
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,614
But it was fun, sir.
nice mood it was.

803
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:09,384
Tell me something, Captain Raj.

804
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:12,122
Do you want the war to happen ever?

805
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:17,094
Madam, why are you going on
talking about the war? Yes?

806
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:20,263
And in any case,
who are we to decide.

807
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,897
You can do anything if you so wish.

808
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,499
Yes, we can do anything. There is
just one task that we cannot do.

809
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,709
What is that?

810
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:32,204
We cannot stop you from leaving.

811
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:41,614
By the way, Raj, after
watching the Antakshari today..

812
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:44,820
..L felt that all of you know
how to enjoy the tension as well.

813
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,219
Yes. Correct.

814
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:53,428
By the way, I think
we must leave now.

815
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:04,012
Raj. I had to tell you
something important.

816
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:05,845
Yes. Tell me, what is it?

817
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:07,043
Thank you.

818
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:11,275
Do you know why did
the minister come today?

819
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:15,579
We have Information
that after two days..

820
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,024
..On the border of
Pakistan and India.

821
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:20,118
There it goes.

822
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:23,531
War is to be declared
Day after Tomorrow? ..yes!

823
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:28,770
China is helping Pakistan to..

824
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,405
.. Iaunch a nuclear
strike on us through them.

825
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:37,044
But today, after seeing everything,
I don't think there should be any war

826
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,544
you should stop this war.

827
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,106
Stop this war?

828
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,185
Madam, the war hasn't even started
yet. Why are you getting tensed?

829
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:47,586
Come.

830
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,118
The matter is not about
getting tensed, Raj.

831
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:53,084
The matter is about
those two countries..

832
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:54,929
That were one at a point of time.

833
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:57,196
In order to make others'
motives successful..

834
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,261
..We are harming ourselves.

835
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,934
You should stop this war.

836
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:05,404
Listen, I am a captain
here. Not the prime minister.

837
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,407
Yes, if it would have been in my
hands, I would have stopped it for sure.

838
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:13,440
And in any case, ourjob is to
carry out our orders. At all costs.

839
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:16,978
And my soldiers and I
know our job very well

840
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:20,688
And you are talking as
if the war has started.

841
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:23,055
Please be assured.
Nothing is going to happen.

842
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:25,754
And there will be some
solution by day after.

843
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:30,363
Best of luck with your
report. And don't worry.

844
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,863
If I am alive, I will
come and meet you myself.

845
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:11,599
"The Earth is
shining and gleaming."

846
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,040
"There is beauty all
around in the environment."

847
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:20,278
"The Earth is
shining and gleaming."

848
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:22,441
"There is beauty all
around in the environment."

849
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:26,849
"The cuckoo is signing beautifully
and the peacock is dancing."

850
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:29,251
"There are waterfalls everywhere."

851
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,281
"And rivers are flowing
away in severe gusts."

852
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:35,657
"When the breeze rustles
away, buds start blooming."

853
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:39,060
"The fields are golden."

854
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:42,430
"The fields are golden."

855
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,631
"And the harvest looks silver."

856
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:51,072
"My country is great.
My country is great."

857
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:55,442
"My country is great.
My country is great."

858
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:59,778
"My country is great.
My country is great."

859
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:04,451
"My country is great.
My country is great."

860
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:22,237
"When our flag, the Tricolor, flies
away in the pride of being lndian."

861
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:26,246
"We stand with our heads
held high with pride."

862
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:30,878
"And our chest becomes
broad filled with pride."

863
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:34,218
"When our country calls out to us,
we can sacrifice our lives for it."

864
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,348
Khatri.

865
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:39,522
Rut has told me that war is
to be declared a day after.

866
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,157
I think we should check it..
- Okay, sir.

867
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:42,955
Take the stuff.
- Okay, sir.

868
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:47,661
"The fields have a golden color."

869
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:48,835
Take a u-turn.

870
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,031
Madam, this is war time.

871
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:53,107
We'll get stuck.

872
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:54,971
The whole country is stuck.

873
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:58,171
Now it is time to get
it out of this mess.

874
00:48:58,735 --> 00:48:59,543
Suresh, take a U-turn.

875
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,708
"My country is great.
My country is great."

876
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,718
"Our country is really great."

877
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:06,114
"My country is great.
My country is great."

878
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:08,178
"Our country is really great."

879
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:10,416
"My country is great.
My country is great."

880
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:12,356
"Our country is really great."

881
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:14,894
"My country is great.
My country is great."

882
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:17,056
"Our country is really great."

883
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:19,361
"My country is great.
My country is great."

884
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:21,391
"Our country is really great."

885
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:23,664
"My country is great.
My country is great."

886
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,603
"Our country is really great."

887
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:28,103
"My country is great.
My country is great."

888
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:30,042
"Our country is really great."

889
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,511
"My country is great.
My country is great."

890
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,810
"Our country is really great."

891
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,685
Hey, madam. You came back?

892
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,045
Where is Captain Raj?

893
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:44,091
Now boss, India has got
information from somewhere..

894
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:46,788
..That we want to
strike them through you.

895
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:49,758
But don't worry.
Hey, we have changed the plan.

896
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,194
Now the nuclear bomb will
reach by tomorrow morning.

897
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:54,064
Guru now clap your hands.

898
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:57,396
Hey, general sir. General sir.

899
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,506
Sir, general, please get
done with it. And come out.

900
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:03,242
This Chinese has gone mad.

901
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:05,843
Hey, let me do
something peacefully.

902
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:08,876
I wouldn't get out right now.
- There is no tension.

903
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:10,747
I mean the job that was to be
done tomorrow will be done today.

904
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:12,286
And today's job will
be done right now.

905
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:13,882
You mean the attack
will be done today?

906
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:14,820
Yes, Sir. Right.

907
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:18,159
Boss, God knows how were those people
who got love in return for their love.

908
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,392
Hey, he is saying he wants
the attack them today itself.

909
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:24,695
You expect me to declare a war from
this toilet seat? I can't come out.

910
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:26,863
Oh no. You are too disgusting.

911
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:28,494
Now come out.

912
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:31,428
Hey, I am trying-

913
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:33,734
who can predict them? They
might throw the bomb right now.

914
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:34,741
What is this?

915
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:38,105
Just assume we've declared the war.

916
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:40,943
According to our sources,
infiltration from Pakistan

917
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:43,417
.. border have increased a lot
the Indian army is on high alert.

918
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:46,112
Gosh, what is that?

919
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,289
Keeping all these things in mind..

920
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:51,324
Hey, the Pakistani minister
just visited our place, right?

921
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:53,757
For that peace and harmony treaty.

922
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:57,224
Hey, Nikki. You're chatting
in Pakistan zone, right?

923
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:59,797
Yes.
- I see. Ask him.

924
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,698
The news is showing that
the war is about to start.

925
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,368
Once again, the lndo-Pak
relations have been strained.

926
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:11,202
Hey, the girl from
India has sent a message.

927
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:13,243
She has written that
war is about to start.

928
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:16,217
Tell her that it is
the same here as well.

929
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,176
The same crap is
there as well, buddies.

930
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:22,288
Guys, what is your
thinking about this?

931
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:26,488
Is this the time for a war?
War is useless.

932
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:30,655
Leave the war aside, buddies.

933
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:34,129
Sir. Did you contact the border?

934
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:37,364
Slowly. Slowly.
Don't worry. I am trying.

935
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:42,410
Make it fast.

936
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,875
A guy on cycle would've delivered
the message by now.

937
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,979
So why don't you correct your mistake
now. Send someone by cycle itself.

938
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,549
What? - Should I just leave
this and play my game?

939
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:49,676
Hey, no, no, general Sir.

940
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:51,617
Tell me. This is too much..
- Please remain calm.

941
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:53,351
Hey, fool.

942
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:57,288
Can't you see I'm dying of Malaria?

943
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:58,918
Please pick up the phone, son.

944
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:02,488
He's gone to pee I guess.

945
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:05,461
Fool. Hey, the phone..

946
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:09,827
There you are ...sleeping
right here? Get up.. - What?

947
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,503
Hello. Speak to me.

948
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:17,438
Yes, yes, speaking.
This is General this side.

949
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:20,482
Oh my God... it's the mother..
- Yes, okay, okay.

950
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:21,641
It is okay till there.

951
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:24,083
Listen to me carefully.
- Yes, tell me, sir.

952
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,620
The bomb has to be fired today.

953
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:27,119
Yes. Which one?

954
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:29,314
Hey, which one? Do you
have 150 bombs with you?

955
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:30,785
There is only one bomb.
And there is only one country.

956
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,225
The job has to be done today.

957
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:34,123
What? Today?

958
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:35,127
Yes. Today.

959
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,893
Meaning right away?
- Right away.

960
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:39,164
Hello, are you the
the General speaking?

961
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:42,897
This is the General here.
One minute. You can ask him.

962
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:45,537
Who is speaking?
- Hey, the General is speaking.

963
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:46,540
Did you hear that?

964
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:48,543
Hey, no, no, lthought
it is a wrong number.

965
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:50,600
Sometimes I get calls from wrong
number. Should I explode the bomb?

966
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:52,577
The attack has to
be done today. Okay?

967
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:54,741
Right now?
- Right now. Over and out.

968
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,010
Yes.
- Yes. Make it quick.

969
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:57,408
Thank you.

970
00:52:57,741 --> 00:52:58,845
You were great.

971
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:00,847
Wish you a happy Eid.
- To you too.

972
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:03,685
Come on, come quickly. Soldiers.

973
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:06,020
Come on, now's the
time to make history.

974
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:06,856
What happened, sir?

975
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:08,123
Listen. Listen to me carefully.

976
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:10,764
The bomb has to be exploded.
Where are Qureshi and the others?

977
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:12,494
Sir, they must be sleeping in the tents.
- Sleeping?

978
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:14,296
What kind of soldiers are
they? They are still sleeping?

979
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:15,960
Go and tell them. I have called.
- Yes.

980
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:16,834
The bomb has to be fired.

981
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:18,736
We have come to know from
our reliable sources..

982
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:21,241
..That there is a lot
of tension at the border.

983
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:25,204
Hey, put Queen here. the Queen.

984
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,981

00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:34,155
Hello Captain Raj.
Alfa 123 calling.

986
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:35,854
Where are you Captain Raj?

987
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,058
Madam, they must be
towards the border.

988
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:40,486
Shall we go there?

989
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:41,995
Everyone, come here.

990
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,292
Reporting sir.
- Have you seen Captain Qureshi?

991
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:46,866
If I don't bring her on this side..
I'll change my name from Qureshi..

992
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:48,864
Well, She's already
gone ...mister..

993
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:54,866
Don't talk of leaving today..
- Sir.

994
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:56,467
What? - I couldn't find Captain
Qureshi anywhere.

995
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:57,872
When will you find him?
After the bomb explodes?

996
00:53:57,968 --> 00:53:59,345
I have woken up all
the soldiers twice.

997
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:02,073
But they are not getting up.
- Kick their backside and make them!

998
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:03,751
Rather put the bomb.

999
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,842
They'll wake up by the explosion.

1000
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,752
I feel like spraying a bit myself.

1001
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:16,156
Okay, tell me something,
captain Qureshi.

1002
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,830
Is there any
information on your side?

1003
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:23,704
Is there information on your side?
- Yes, there is.

1004
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:27,338
I have heard that a war is
going to be declared a day after.

1005
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:32,277
Oh great! here we
got ahead of you guys.

1006
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:36,179
We've been informed that it is
going to be declared tomorrow.

1007
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:41,451
Hey, throw off this underwear
on the launcher at least.

1008
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:43,280
Now fire it.

1009
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,286
Now listen to this
Khatri, its hillarious

1010
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:48,225
We have information that the war is
to be declared the day after tomorrow.

1011
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:51,093
But they have information that the
war is to be declared tomorrow itself.

1012
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,897
Now let's see whose
information is right.

1013
00:54:58,061 --> 00:54:59,096
Hey!

1014
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:04,339
Go off...

1015
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:09,007
The tank's empty.
finished all I had... Sir

1016
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:15,647
Oye, Khatri.
- Hey!

1017
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,250
Hey, Khatri!

1018
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:21,221
Sir.. Neither their Information
nor our's is correct...

1019
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:23,159
the War has already
been declared. Run.

1020
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,231
Take it, take it, take it.
Take the stuff.

1021
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,399
Hey, fool. Not that the bottle.
Take the rifle.

1022
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:29,027
You all right?
- Yes, I am fine, sir.

1023
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,162
Qureshi. We leave this game here.

1024
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:34,138
Leave it. Leave it. Come on, come on.
- And will start from this very point.

1025
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:36,440
If only ...you remain alive.

1026
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:50,347
SURINDER.

1027
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:53,660
They are throwing stones we
should reply them with boulders.

1028
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:54,627
Okay, sir.

1029
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:56,659
Everyone, take positions
around the bunker.

1030
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,721
Sir.
- Sir.

1031
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:29,328
Come on.
- Come on.

1032
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,888
Is this a joke?

1033
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:34,562
They are throwing bombs
without informing us.

1034
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:35,729
What is this man ?

1035
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,564
Why are you getting scared?
And running here and there?

1036
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:40,368
Speak to me.

1037
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:44,104
What is this?
- Hey, run, run.

1038
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:45,937
Bhutto.. Bhutto.

1039
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:49,548
Son, there is milk on the heater,
Bhutto. Come on, run. Come on.

1040
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:51,275
Wait, where are you all going?

1041
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:53,547
Come on, run fast. Keep moving.

1042
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,322
What are you doing here?

1043
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:03,629
Why did you come back?

1044
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:12,405
Scoundrels .. Are you in the army to
crouch and sit inside a tent frightened.

1045
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,670
What are you doing here?
Should I give you bowls?

1046
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:16,508
Seems you are sitting
in a refugee camp

1047
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:17,976
Only the bowls are lacking here.

1048
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:19,603
Now get up you fools and
take positions in the bunker.

1049
00:57:19,702 --> 00:57:23,240
Quereshi, Eat something.
How will fight on empty stomach.

1050
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:26,314
Let us have bullets, sir.
Shall we go?

1051
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,155
Come on <i>,</i> make it fast.

1052
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:00,146
Hello? Hello, sir. Ruth.

1053
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:02,915
Yes, Ruth, tell me.

1054
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,750
Sir, the information was wrong.

1055
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:08,394
I knew, these ministers
are all the same.

1056
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:11,362
No, sir. Instead of starting day
after, the war has begun today itself.

1057
00:58:11,855 --> 00:58:13,630
What you are hearing,
sir is live fire.

1058
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:15,803
What? Fantastic!

1059
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:18,872
Where is the camera? Where is the
camera? Ruth, we are going live.

1060
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:21,671
Camera? It is with me, sir.

1061
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:24,441
Where is the camera?
Go live, go live, go live.

1062
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:27,242
Go..
- Live, sir? But..

1063
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:29,472
I don't want to listen
to anything. Just go live.

1064
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:34,378
Forget ifs and buts. Just go live.

1065
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:35,650
Connect it. Fast.

1066
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,783
Madam, in order to show this live..

1067
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:39,952
.. My village folks will
see my death video live.

1068
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,120
And we don't listen to him..

1069
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,187
.. Your family wouldn't be able
to see you for the last time

1070
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:45,526
Your dead body will straight to
your village. Will that be fine??

1071
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:47,033
Go, come on, make it fast.

1072
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,294
Ruth. What happened?
- Yes, sir.

1073
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:52,169
Ruth, what happened?
- Yes, sir. Just give me one second.

1074
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:53,332
Give me one minute.

1075
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:56,307
Ruth, where are you? Ruth?
Where are you, darling?

1076
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:59,707
Ranjit! Come here. Connect this.

1077
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:01,878
Sir, recording live.
- Madam, what are you doing?

1078
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:03,245
Switch off your phone.
- One minute. Come on.

1079
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:05,216
Yes, yes, yes. Got it,
got it, got it, got it.

1080
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:07,579
Close in on that soldier. Yes, Sir.

1081
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:11,357
Stay there, stay there.

1082
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:13,187
Fantastic. Fantastic.

1083
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,291
Hey, madam, what are you doing?
Just switch off your phone.

1084
00:59:16,419 --> 00:59:18,865
Two minutes, Raj. Two minutes.
- Stay right there on that soldier.

1085
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:19,660
Yes, sir.

1086
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:21,867
Stay there. Stay there.

1087
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:28,266
Fantastic. Great.

1088
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:36,709
Oh crap!
- Oh crap!

1089
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:39,047
Get up from here.
What are you doing?

1090
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:41,588
They are tracing the signals and
hitting the bomb right on the target.

1091
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,917
Hey, take a close up of the bomb.
- Yes, sir.

1092
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:46,015
Actually that..
- why isn't the bomb exploding?

1093
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:47,185
Actually that..
- Switch off the phone.

1094
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:48,786
It is not exploding.
- Just switch it off.

1095
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:50,963
Oh crap.

1096
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:53,466
Ruth, where are you?
Even the phone got disconnected.

1097
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,092
Anchor. Anchor in. Anchor in.

1098
00:59:57,393 --> 00:59:59,066
We will play with all our might.

1099
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:03,641
Who can be a better example of
this saying except Ruth Dutta.

1100
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:07,039
Our brave reporter who was giving
us live news from the border..

1101
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,043
..That's when this bomb
fell right in front of her.

1102
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:09,979
Look at this.

1103
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:13,549
The great brave woman has come in
front of us in the disguise of Ruth.

1104
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:15,684
She is covering the bomb till now.

1105
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,059
Now we have to see whether
this bomb will explode or not.

1106
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,925
You will tell us whether
this bomb will go off or not.

1107
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,786
Type your answers..

1108
01:00:22,919 --> 01:00:25,058
.. Right now and send
us to 348780 right now.

1109
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:36,700
Raj. What are you doing?

1110
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:37,969
Are you insane?

1111
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:42,249
Madam, this is worse
than a diwali cracker.

1112
01:00:42,405 --> 01:00:44,043
Why did you pick it up?

1113
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:49,185
Don't worry.
This won't explode. Look at this.

1114
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:50,647
Made in China.

1115
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,924
Do one thing. Do one thing.

1116
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:02,768
The winner of question we asked ..

1117
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,532
..Before we went for a break is.

1118
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:06,901
..Nandkuram Mithomal
Khedachand Gangu Ramani.

1119
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:09,072
He answered that the
bomb will explode.

1120
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:11,174
And look at this.
- Yes

1121
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:14,070
So at last, the bomb has exploded.

1122
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:17,750
The brave reporter of our channel,
Ruth Dutta is out of danger now.

1123
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:20,315
Her bravery is being
made for everyone to see.

1124
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,714
Forgive me, it can
be seen by everyone.

1125
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:26,553
Seems like the connection
with the border is breaking.

1126
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:29,963
Once again lets show
you what happened.

1127
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,436
Not only once. It feels
that this bomb is exploding"

1128
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:41,169
.. again and again since morning.

1129
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:45,576
I feel like this blast
video is animated, man.

1130
01:01:46,569 --> 01:01:47,707
I think so.

1131
01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:50,951
Hey, Nikki. Ask your
Pakistani friends.

1132
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:52,085
What is happening there?

1133
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:54,418
And at the same time, if you have to
talk about the viewpoint of Pakistan..

1134
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:55,581
..Even Pakistan says..

1135
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:59,218
Hey, that girl in India. She has her
point of view about about the war..

1136
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:01,057
..Saying that Pakistan
has started the war.

1137
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:04,895
Pakistan? The talk here is
that India has started the war.

1138
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:06,164
Write it to her.

1139
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:10,363
India is blaming Pak.
And Pak is blaming India.

1140
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:13,237
I think someone has really
thought of causing problems.

1141
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:15,873
We have been fighting
for the last 65 years.

1142
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:18,101
The war has begun.

1143
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:21,745
And Afghanistan is Great!

1144
01:02:21,938 --> 01:02:25,408
Brother. Pakistan is this
side. And India is on that side.

1145
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:28,254
Oh no, I made a mistake. Wait.

1146
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:33,286
Pakistan is this side.
And India is on that side, brother.

1147
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:36,228
This side? Then I will
shoot this way. Yes.

1148
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:37,553
Brother.
- Yes?

1149
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,692
Pakistan is this side.
And India is on that side.

1150
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:40,826
Hey!

1151
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:42,997
Don't talk rubbish.

1152
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:46,269
Earlier, you got me confused
between a female and male goat.

1153
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:48,806
Now you are getting me confused
between India and Pakistan.

1154
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:51,637
Should I ask your
mother where India is?

1155
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:53,870
Son of a Scoundrel! Fool!

1156
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:58,384
I will tell you. Take a look.

1157
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:01,354
Afghanistan is here.

1158
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:08,027
Doha is with Afghanistan. Where
your uncle stays. Yes, brother.

1159
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:10,223
Turkmenistan is above that.

1160
01:03:10,653 --> 01:03:12,792
Besides that is Uzbekistan.

1161
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:15,435
Where your aunt stays.
- Yes brother.

1162
01:03:15,491 --> 01:03:17,266
Infront of that is Kazakhstan.

1163
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:19,370
Rooshiya is below Kazakhstan.

1164
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:21,805
Below Rooshiya is China.
- Yes.

1165
01:03:21,898 --> 01:03:24,208
Under that, Bay of Bengal.

1166
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,636
And under that, Sri Lanka.

1167
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:31,243
Yes. - And above that,
my deserving friend is India.

1168
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:34,880
Yes, brother. - India is here.

1169
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:38,289
Yes brother indeed!

1170
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:43,619
Made a fool out of you.

1171
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:47,659
I was just testing you.

1172
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:52,939
India is not this side,
fools. It is this side.

1173
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:55,442
Here comes my Missile.

1174
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:58,740
Hey, Captain Raj.
I am Commander Khan.

1175
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:00,345
Holy Crap!!

1176
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:08,655
Someone exploded
the bomb on our side.

1177
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:11,152
Sir, I feel ..
- What?

1178
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:16,157
Someone got an upset stomach by
having pulses without meat, sir.

1179
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:18,763
He is rebelling, sir.
exploding a bomb on our side.

1180
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:20,798
Let me see who this scoundrel is..
- One minute, one minute.

1181
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:22,596
Let us first talk to
the ones in front of us.

1182
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:25,398
If they explode a bomb, we will
be picking our minced meat, sir.

1183
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:26,799
You are right.
- Sir.

1184
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:28,900
Hey Captain Raj..

1185
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:36,642
You can cough up first.
And keep coughing in peace.

1186
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:41,588
And see that your intestines
don't come out coughing.

1187
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,357
Did you see? He is
wishing ill for me.

1188
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:45,548
Hey, I will take
your intestines out.

1189
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:47,959
Speak to me.
- Hey, sir, sir. Control.

1190
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:51,691
If you get satisfied talking

1191
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:53,993
.. go ahead and talk.
- Control, sir. Control.

1192
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:56,496
You will feel light at heart.

1193
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,501
You talk to them. Don't take my name.
- Okay.

1194
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:02,503
And if you have to talk, have
cough syrup before coming.

1195
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,670
Tell him that I had it. Tell him..
- He had cough syrup.

1196
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:10,417
I see. Qureshi. Qureshi, I am talking
about syrup and not country liquor

1197
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:14,213
Rude fellow..
- Look what he is saying. All rubbish.

1198
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:18,759
Maybe Khan has become so old that
even the syrup is no more effective.

1199
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:20,588
Your father must be old.

1200
01:05:21,684 --> 01:05:22,992
I am still young.

1201
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:24,325
And listen to me.

1202
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:27,899
I will have breakfast in
Jaipur, lunch in Jodhpur..

1203
01:05:28,157 --> 01:05:31,934
..And dinner in Delhi. And have
ice-cream in Patna. Tell him.

1204
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:33,962
Sir. - What happened? - Sir.
Patna cancelled. Not Patna.

1205
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:36,136
One mustn't go to Patna, sir.
I have heard that..

1206
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:37,644
..People from Patna are such that..

1207
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:39,169
.. They turn every place
that they visit into Bihar.

1208
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:40,646
Sir, Patna cancelled. Patna is..
- You only talk to him.

1209
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:42,047
Don't take my name. Talk to him.

1210
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:45,682
So the ice-cream program
in Patna is cancelled.

1211
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:47,282
Its okay till Delhi.

1212
01:05:47,476 --> 01:05:49,956
In any case, we have a stomach
upset because of the food here.

1213
01:05:50,012 --> 01:05:51,150
Why are you telling
them about all this?

1214
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:53,285
Hey, you just tell us
about the menu. Menu.

1215
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:54,351
Menu.

1216
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:57,589
Hey, have you come for the
wedding procession of Sania?

1217
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:00,528
Forget the menu. Take this bullet.

1218
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:09,835
Hey, rude man. Till now, you were
talking about a medicine for cough.

1219
01:06:09,865 --> 01:06:11,037
Where did this bullet come from?

1220
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:13,741
Don't think that
I didn't aim right.

1221
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:17,150
And in any case, we don't
launch attacks on dumb people.

1222
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:20,986
That is why my bullet
shot passed by Khan's ear.

1223
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:25,689
Listen to our commands. The
next time, my aim wouldn't fail.

1224
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:27,160
Fire.

1225
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:46,144
Hey, there thing is good.

1226
01:06:46,602 --> 01:06:48,707
Each second, they are
firing dozens of bullets.

1227
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:52,844
And look at us. Even our
bullets have been counted.

1228
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:55,881
We are not getting a
chance from this location.

1229
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:57,754
Lets change and go to
a different location.

1230
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,989
What I don't understand is,
How can they keep firing?

1231
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:09,959
Now shoot.

1232
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:11,995
And show to the entire country.

1233
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:15,840
How each Indian soldier
is equal to ten of them.

1234
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:24,710
Are they firing bullets
or throwing them?

1235
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:27,380
Holy Crap.

1236
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:32,587
After giving us lame horses they
are asking us to win the race.

1237
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:34,219
So brother, now what should we do?

1238
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:37,694
I told you, These made in China
weapons will get us in trouble.

1239
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:41,434
Now make your soldiers
operate the weapons.

1240
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:44,900
I can operate.

1241
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,736
But actually I wouldn't
be able to see anything.

1242
01:07:48,931 --> 01:07:50,638
To hell with it!!

1243
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,611
This is the bomb. It has to
be released towards their side.

1244
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:54,113
What are you doing? Make it fast.

1245
01:07:54,136 --> 01:07:55,877
Now hold it in their direction..

1246
01:07:55,938 --> 01:07:57,781
Hey, lower your volume
They will hear us.

1247
01:07:57,807 --> 01:07:58,842
..And release it

1248
01:08:00,142 --> 01:08:02,053
Holy Crap!! It fell down here only.
Run. Run.. - Come on, run.

1249
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,921
It is about to explode. Run.
- Come on, run.

1250
01:08:08,684 --> 01:08:11,187
Soldiers. Keep on firing.

1251
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,366
See to it that not
even one comes fonlvard.

1252
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:15,561
Sir, we are firing constantly.

1253
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:17,362
They are the ones hiding safely.

1254
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:19,397
Really?

1255
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:21,531
Please come, madam.

1256
01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:23,299
I will make you meet our X-man.

1257
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:24,636
X-man?

1258
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:33,014
Brother X-man.
- Yes, sir.

1259
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:35,789
These Pakistanis are
hiding inside their bunkers.

1260
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:37,521
How can we trace them?

1261
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:41,091
Sir, order some
chicken in that case.

1262
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:43,055
Chicken? You had food, right?

1263
01:08:43,252 --> 01:08:47,962
Sir. Look at this. Tracker chip.

1264
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,734
Pakistani soldiers will come out
of their bunkers like anything.

1265
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,467
We will target and shoot them.

1266
01:08:53,696 --> 01:08:54,572
Keep watchingl!

1267
01:08:54,597 --> 01:08:56,543
Really? Subedar.
- Sir?

1268
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:57,543
Get some chicken.

1269
01:08:57,566 --> 01:08:58,704
But the chicken should be alive.

1270
01:09:10,112 --> 01:09:11,785
Now look at the
tracker's efficiency.

1271
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,139
Keep watching, sir.

1272
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:33,711
How all of them will come out of
their bunkers seeing these hens.

1273
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:42,447
We got lucky to see the
chicken after so long.

1274
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:46,559
You keep the fire burning. I will
feed you roasted chicken today.

1275
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:48,721
Here comes a Pakistani.

1276
01:09:48,817 --> 01:09:50,160
I won't spare you.

1277
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,427
Get them..
- Come on, get them.

1278
01:09:55,624 --> 01:09:58,366
These red ones are our hens and
green ones are Pakistani soldiers.

1279
01:09:58,494 --> 01:09:59,529
Wow, they are coming out.

1280
01:09:59,962 --> 01:10:01,964
Get them..
- Come on, get them.

1281
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:07,637
Lord, you have heard our
prayers after a long time today.

1282
01:10:08,504 --> 01:10:09,949
Sir, many of them have come out.

1283
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:11,177
Sir, we should start
attacking them right now.

1284
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,480
No, no, wait for some time.

1285
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:15,251
Get them..
- Come on, get them.

1286
01:10:15,678 --> 01:10:19,251
No, no, I got hold of that..
- I last chicken had in my reception.

1287
01:10:19,648 --> 01:10:22,322
You line of beggars. Leave them.

1288
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:24,364
Come back and take your
positions inside bunkers.

1289
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:26,229
Leave him eat, sir.
The poor one is hungry.

1290
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:27,329
Hey, fool!

1291
01:10:27,356 --> 01:10:28,801
Sir, sir..
- What happened?

1292
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,232
Where is the chicken sir ?

1293
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:31,499
Idiots! They are hens from India.

1294
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:33,130
It is some ploy of the enemies
to catch you off gaurd.

1295
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:35,232
Qureshi, these are
Pakistani hens. Take a look.

1296
01:10:35,264 --> 01:10:37,244
They are wearing an
amulet on their neck, dear.

1297
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:39,773
My eyes won't betray me.

1298
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:41,044
Amulet?

1299
01:10:42,171 --> 01:10:44,742
Morons they are.

1300
01:10:44,873 --> 01:10:47,683
These are not amulets.
But transmitters.

1301
01:10:49,445 --> 01:10:51,447
Qureshi, you will
die. Don't go there.

1302
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:53,254
Fools, come back you hungry nuts.
- Chicken, sir, this is great.

1303
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:54,784
Hey, you idiots..
- Sir, look at the chicken.

1304
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:57,058
Leave them. - They are leaving sir.
Lets shoot them, sir.

1305
01:10:57,119 --> 01:10:59,656
No, no, wait.
- Sir, look, they will go, sir.

1306
01:11:00,122 --> 01:11:03,729
Fools.. leave that chicken.

1307
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:06,102
Sir. Look, they will leave, sir.
- Wait.. - But sir..

1308
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:07,732
Each on of us will die, you idiots.

1309
01:11:10,466 --> 01:11:11,638
Sir, they are all gone.

1310
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:16,879
Even I am hungry. Even lfeel
like having roasted chicken.

1311
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:18,985
But understand, enemy
is trying to trick us.

1312
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,746
All of them are gone.

1313
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:21,885
Shoot now.

1314
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:28,927
Oh no, this one is quite stocky.
Everyone will get a piece of it.

1315
01:11:28,984 --> 01:11:30,759
But after the war ends. Wait
here quereshi, I will be back.

1316
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:33,224
We will win the war indeed.

1317
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:38,034
Our soldiers on the border
are also a part of our public.

1318
01:11:38,927 --> 01:11:40,304
We will be victors for sure.

1319
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:42,831
We and our country..
- This minister is quite powerful.

1320
01:11:43,265 --> 01:11:45,302
I must say..
- Impossible.

1321
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:47,306
His age is to have supplements.

1322
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:49,946
Power without Supplementsll
- We must encourage them.

1323
01:11:50,205 --> 01:11:51,377
All I am saying is..

1324
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,349
There is so much
tension on the border.

1325
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:54,852
And he went there all alone?

1326
01:11:55,377 --> 01:11:57,448
Ask your friend from India.

1327
01:11:57,546 --> 01:11:59,321
We are not scared of anyone.
- Guys.

1328
01:11:59,415 --> 01:12:03,056
Taufiq is saying that their minister
visited the border amidst all tension..

1329
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:06,155
Its the same things
happening here as well.

1330
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:08,401
It is all a war game, man.

1331
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:09,864
It is all vote bank politics.

1332
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:11,504
He must have gone earlier and
they are just showing it now.

1333
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:14,598
You are right. Without a reason
they don't leave their house.

1334
01:12:14,897 --> 01:12:16,376
And he will go to the border?

1335
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:19,971
All of this is rubbish.
There is some drama or the other.

1336
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:22,576
I will stay here at the border..

1337
01:12:23,572 --> 01:12:25,609
.. Till the time my soldier
brothers are standing here.

1338
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:28,985
Thank you and may Lord be with you.

1339
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:33,521
Cut! What a shot, sir.

1340
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:35,293
You acted so well.

1341
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:38,259
Mister, was everything fine?

1342
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:40,493
Sir, the public wouldn't
even come to know..

1343
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:42,627
..That this shoot happened
inside this studio.

1344
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:44,502
Take a look at the footage.

1345
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:47,807
Its coming out as if
it is completely live.

1346
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:49,909
Did you see the talent
of our brave soldier?

1347
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:52,176
They went after the
chicken so vehemently.

1348
01:12:52,234 --> 01:12:54,544
But sir, they have gone
into hiding once again.

1349
01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:59,917
Now take a look how we will
get them out of their burrows.

1350
01:13:00,342 --> 01:13:02,652
Brother, before I
call out to them..

1351
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:04,316
..Take your respective positions.

1352
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:05,551
Okay?
- Yes, sir.

1353
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:12,162
Shoaib Ali reporting.

1354
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:15,093
Present, sir.
- Fire.

1355
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:17,769
Oh Mother. it was them who called.

1356
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:20,672
I am saved.

1357
01:13:20,763 --> 01:13:22,606
Shahrukh Khan reporting.

1358
01:13:22,698 --> 01:13:24,177
Reporting, sir.
- Fire.

1359
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:25,839
Present, sir.

1360
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:28,481
Why did you stand up?

1361
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,379
Sir, you only gave the command.

1362
01:13:30,472 --> 01:13:32,452
I called out to the
Shahrukh Khan on their side.

1363
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:34,588
Sir, Shahrukh is
common on both sides.

1364
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,416
Specially when it
comes to Indian films.

1365
01:13:36,612 --> 01:13:38,956
Oh no, take your position. Come on.

1366
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:41,686
Keep sitting. No one
will get up, you fools.

1367
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,161
Because of foolish
soldiers like you..

1368
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:45,165
The reputation of Pakistani
army is in shambles.

1369
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:47,224
Don't be surprised. I am here.
I am here.

1370
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:52,564
Sachin Tendulkar reporting.

1371
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:58,344
Sachin Tendulkar reporting.

1372
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:03,676
I see. So he trying to
trick us with our own ploy?

1373
01:14:03,705 --> 01:14:05,810
Sir. What are you doing?

1374
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:08,754
What happened? -There is
only one Sachin Tendulkar.

1375
01:14:08,977 --> 01:14:11,514
And he is in the Indian Cricket
team. How can you call him here?

1376
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:13,820
I see. I made a mistake.
I will try once more.

1377
01:14:13,982 --> 01:14:15,825
Sachin Tendulkar reporting.

1378
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:21,934
You sons of a fool!
I told you to keep sitting.

1379
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:24,402
We stood up to see
Sachin Tendulkar, sir.

1380
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:27,430
Stood up. You idiots
have a problem in there.

1381
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:29,042
All the time it stands up.

1382
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:30,371
No one will stand up now.

1383
01:14:30,432 --> 01:14:31,934
Listen, what is his name? Read it.

1384
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:33,841
Rajvir Singh..
- Rajvir Singh?

1385
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:36,380
Rajvir Singh Rana reporting.

1386
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:40,548
Hey, Rajvir Singh Rana.

1387
01:14:40,676 --> 01:14:42,178
I will show him how it works.

1388
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:45,750
When ajat is hits,
he hits it hard.

1389
01:14:46,582 --> 01:14:47,560
You are amazing.

1390
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:50,325
Who called for Rajvir Singh?

1391
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:53,096
Stand up and show me your face.

1392
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:54,065
Okay, I will.

1393
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:57,364
It is me who called. Speak to me..

1394
01:14:57,459 --> 01:14:58,494
Hey, sir..

1395
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:00,733
Did they shoot at me?

1396
01:15:00,863 --> 01:15:02,865
You only gave them
an invitation, sir.

1397
01:15:04,032 --> 01:15:06,774
Really. -Speak to me. Sit down
sir, before another bullet is shot?

1398
01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:07,940
What are you scolding me?

1399
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:10,210
The neighbour country
is intelligent, sir.

1400
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:12,544
Got it? They could have
made you look like an idiot.

1401
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:16,248
How rudely you are speaking to me.

1402
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:18,655
I have brought you up
like a kid. Like a kid.

1403
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,921
And now you.. - Even I have brought
you up like a father, right?

1404
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:22,729
This is the limit
of ungratefulness.

1405
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:25,661
Myself Satyendrapal Singh Gasona.
And you are?

1406
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:29,031
I think he has a weak memory.

1407
01:15:29,057 --> 01:15:30,400
Give him some 'Memory Plus'.

1408
01:15:31,426 --> 01:15:32,734
He's asking me my name.

1409
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:34,968
Forget this. Now listen to me.

1410
01:15:35,597 --> 01:15:38,100
I've received news
that a herdsman..

1411
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:41,943
..Stops our brave
infiltrators from infiltrating.

1412
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:43,948
So, I've made
arrangements for them.

1413
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:46,845
He's right.

1414
01:15:47,809 --> 01:15:49,948
Do you have chocolates?
- No.

1415
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:51,422
Kohl?
- No.

1416
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:52,556
Do you always say

1417
01:15:52,614 --> 01:15:54,423
Let's have something sweet
before offering anything?"

1418
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:57,089
Its always bitter first for us.

1419
01:15:57,119 --> 01:15:59,121
And the spying goat?
- Its Pure Rawalpindi.

1420
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:01,827
Brother..
- Don't say that it's a he goat.

1421
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:04,997
So tell me, What are your arrangements?
- Yes.

1422
01:16:06,762 --> 01:16:08,435
Map for you.

1423
01:16:08,597 --> 01:16:10,406
It will take you
directly to Jodhpur.

1424
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:12,937
My rulers have sent it for you.

1425
01:16:13,835 --> 01:16:14,779
Wonderful.

1426
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:17,315
Now, hurry up you both.
Make it fast.

1427
01:16:17,673 --> 01:16:20,085
And you meet me with your
entire force at Jodhpur.

1428
01:16:20,108 --> 01:16:21,178
Understand, soldier.

1429
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:23,681
Good bye.
- Good bye.

1430
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:25,892
Sorry.

1431
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:29,089
He made a mistake.
He doesn't know, he's a fool.

1432
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:30,961
Allah be with you.

1433
01:16:31,053 --> 01:16:32,555
I say let's just sit here.

1434
01:16:32,821 --> 01:16:34,198
Let them fire all they way.

1435
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,070
The more we fire,
the more it backfires.

1436
01:16:38,193 --> 01:16:40,400
I will do it. I will do it.

1437
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:43,809
When you've no one,
then there's China.

1438
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:44,910
FucoL

1439
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:49,878
Fu...Fucol 69?
- Yes.

1440
01:16:49,905 --> 01:16:54,081
No, sir. How can we use Fucol 69?

1441
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:56,389
Two days later, when the
war would have begun..

1442
01:16:56,411 --> 01:16:58,891
..A Chinese engineer was
supposed to show us how to use it.

1443
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:00,291
How will we use it?

1444
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:02,856
Then who will? You're
turning your back?

1445
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:04,430
L...l..
- Bhutto.

1446
01:17:04,987 --> 01:17:07,490
No. you're smarter than him.

1447
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:09,659
You will use it.

1448
01:17:09,725 --> 01:17:10,897
Lift it. Lift it.

1449
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:13,099
Everyone's lost their mind,
now let's lose our lives too.

1450
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:15,163
Fool, you're shrouding Khan sir.

1451
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:19,412
Rascal, always
turning off my lights.

1452
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:21,471
Lift the top.
- Lift it you horse.

1453
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:22,809
Right, sir.

1454
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:24,907
Wonderful.

1455
01:17:26,441 --> 01:17:28,079
Again a Box. Lift it.
- Lift that up.

1456
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:30,779
Wonderful.

1457
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:33,688
Sir, I think the Chinese
are very fond of packaging.

1458
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:34,858
There it is.

1459
01:17:34,883 --> 01:17:38,558
It looks like a toy guy.
- What a discouragement.

1460
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:41,090
Sir, Fucol 69? This..

1461
01:17:41,256 --> 01:17:43,827
There's a booklet along.
Look at its content.

1462
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,030
Heat sensing device.

1463
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:52,603
It senses the heat from the
soldiers, and their guns..

1464
01:17:52,634 --> 01:17:54,614
..And aims at them.

1465
01:17:57,105 --> 01:17:58,140
What's this?

1466
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:01,912
I think it's a remote control.

1467
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:04,757
China Gate. Good job Man.

1468
01:18:05,047 --> 01:18:07,789
Should I press the button.
- Don't delay. Press it.

1469
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:13,598
Sir. Sir. Careful.

1470
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:16,801
Move aside. It could be dangerous.

1471
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:23,470
Qureshi. Qureshi.

1472
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:27,447
He's the one who
kept you in captive.

1473
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:31,144
Freedom. Freedom.
- It senses the heat.

1474
01:18:32,074 --> 01:18:33,382
What the..

1475
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:37,254
I told you...it can be dangerous.

1476
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:38,949
Made in China.

1477
01:18:41,516 --> 01:18:42,824
Good person.

1478
01:18:42,851 --> 01:18:44,524
I told him don't
let this thing out.

1479
01:18:44,586 --> 01:18:46,395
Now, you face it.

1480
01:18:46,588 --> 01:18:48,465
Don't speak, we're
speaking in English. Bhutto.

1481
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:53,897
I don't want to play.

1482
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:55,202
I don't want to play this game.

1483
01:18:55,263 --> 01:18:57,436
Tell him Qureshi.
- It's not working, Sir.

1484
01:18:57,799 --> 01:19:00,006
Remote control is out of control.

1485
01:19:00,202 --> 01:19:02,273
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

1486
01:19:02,337 --> 01:19:06,217
Sir, we understand that this thing
senses heat from the soldiers.

1487
01:19:06,508 --> 01:19:08,215
But who will tell Fucol
69 to differentiate..

1488
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:10,483
..Between an Indian soldier
and a Pakistani soldiers?

1489
01:19:12,614 --> 01:19:14,457
Bhutto, what's this.

1490
01:19:16,852 --> 01:19:17,922
This..

1491
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:21,796
O'Chinese toy, now see
what a Pakistani can do?

1492
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:23,393
Sir...sir..What to do now?

1493
01:19:24,726 --> 01:19:25,397
Sir..

1494
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:26,132
Soldiers..

1495
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:31,373
Someone's calling me.
Someone's calling me.

1496
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,404
That's made in China.

1497
01:19:33,735 --> 01:19:34,975
Doesn't understand Urdu.

1498
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:41,785
Soldiers. I think the enemy
has bought a new weapon.

1499
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:44,823
Pure made in China, bomb
has been delivered to you.

1500
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:48,225
Blast it now, that
the war has begun.

1501
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:49,854
So, what are you waiting for?

1502
01:19:49,885 --> 01:19:52,161
Before the Indian
army is prepared..

1503
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:54,427
..Let's have a Nuclear war.

1504
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:56,992
Then, let's blast it here.
- No.

1505
01:19:57,025 --> 01:19:58,868
Try explaining him.
What is he talking?

1506
01:19:58,927 --> 01:20:03,740
Sir, look...it'll take some
time delivering it to the border.

1507
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:05,176
You don't take me too seriously.

1508
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:07,438
But let me tell you,
I am not that foolish.

1509
01:20:07,569 --> 01:20:11,449
Come, Watch my
arrangements yourself.

1510
01:20:11,773 --> 01:20:12,979
Here. Take this.

1511
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:17,455
Musharaff Movers and Packers.

1512
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:21,320
General. I think
I've heard this name.

1513
01:20:21,449 --> 01:20:22,519
What is this?

1514
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,819
You forgot him.

1515
01:20:24,953 --> 01:20:25,988
Oh yes.

1516
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:29,467
Great. Wonderful.
- Let's go. Let's go.

1517
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:37,275
You know, in this
episode since morning..

1518
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,445
..I've seen everything

1519
01:20:41,403 --> 01:20:44,179
Friendship, love, jokes.

1520
01:20:45,707 --> 01:20:48,187
There's just one thing that's a problem.
- What is that Madam?

1521
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:50,082
Information.

1522
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:55,150
We should try to end this episode?
- It'll fail.

1523
01:20:56,918 --> 01:21:00,764
Why? Have we tried yet?
- No.

1524
01:21:01,256 --> 01:21:02,496
Then, how can we fail?

1525
01:21:04,326 --> 01:21:06,306
We'll have to stop
this war tonight.

1526
01:21:07,062 --> 01:21:09,406
The armies of both the countries
will be here in the morning.

1527
01:21:10,465 --> 01:21:11,739
Then it will be impossible.

1528
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:14,972
Listen, to win we need
to diffuse the mines.

1529
01:21:15,136 --> 01:21:16,615
I am going to cross the border.

1530
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:18,408
Give me cover-fire.

1531
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:06,890
Which cover-fire
are you waiting for?

1532
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:08,799
Catch him.

1533
01:22:13,328 --> 01:22:15,171
He's Khatri too.

1534
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:17,508
Myself, Sahil Khatri.

1535
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:21,540
Which Khatri are you?
- Kabir Khatri.

1536
01:22:23,204 --> 01:22:24,376
So, Kabir Khatri.

1537
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:25,778
Where are you from?

1538
01:22:26,207 --> 01:22:26,981
Sind.

1539
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:29,821
My forefathers were from Sind.

1540
01:22:30,812 --> 01:22:32,519
Now we'll enjoy fighting.

1541
01:22:33,214 --> 01:22:36,024
Where from in Sind?
- Pathan Gali.

1542
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:38,464
Even my forefather
was from Pathan Gali.

1543
01:22:38,486 --> 01:22:40,557
Now we'll enjoy fighting.

1544
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:42,234
Where in Pathan Gali?

1545
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:45,671
8110. Khatru-Alam Vila

1546
01:22:46,861 --> 01:22:49,535
Now we'll enjoy
fighting even more..

1547
01:22:54,569 --> 01:22:55,741
Khatru-Alam Vila?

1548
01:22:57,105 --> 01:23:00,518
Now, Don't say that your
father had a retail shop?

1549
01:23:00,775 --> 01:23:03,153
Yes, he did. Why?

1550
01:23:03,211 --> 01:23:06,055
Now there'll be no fun fighting.

1551
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:07,918
They both are brothers.

1552
01:23:10,352 --> 01:23:11,956
Whether we like it or not.

1553
01:23:13,054 --> 01:23:15,830
But be it parents,
siblings or girlfriend..

1554
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:18,166
..Nothing comes before our country.

1555
01:23:18,526 --> 01:23:20,164
No one's greater than the country.

1556
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:22,306
Khatri.
- Sir.

1557
01:23:22,931 --> 01:23:24,342
Take your position in bunker 12.

1558
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:25,968
Sir, I'll fight at
the fonlvard post.

1559
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:27,480
Khatri, it's an order.
- But, sir..

1560
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:28,310
Khatri!

1561
01:23:37,579 --> 01:23:38,922
It's incredible right, Raj.

1562
01:23:39,781 --> 01:23:41,886
Two brothers, at the battlefield.

1563
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:44,355
Pointing guns at each other.

1564
01:23:45,286 --> 01:23:47,960
And whoever kills
first will get a medal.

1565
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:50,567
Now, that's what I call a story.

1566
01:23:50,759 --> 01:23:52,261
Right, Ranjeet.
- Of course.

1567
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:53,331
What fun!!

1568
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:56,774
One brother, kills another.

1569
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,011
And you're enjoying it.

1570
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:03,414
This isn't two neighbors fighting..

1571
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:06,612
..Where the others can
gather around and have fun.

1572
01:24:08,243 --> 01:24:09,278
You're loving it.

1573
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,516
Then stop it.

1574
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:12,753
Stop this war.

1575
01:24:13,081 --> 01:24:14,389
Madam, you're a reporter.

1576
01:24:15,417 --> 01:24:16,657
Your job is to speak.

1577
01:24:17,552 --> 01:24:19,395
That doesn't stop the war.

1578
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:23,399
Then, either we finish
them, or let them finish us.

1579
01:24:24,459 --> 01:24:25,802
Then will this war stop.

1580
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:30,206
Madam, you're rebuking at me,
as if I've declared this war.

1581
01:24:31,032 --> 01:24:33,342
This is our superior's order.
- Superiors.

1582
01:24:36,538 --> 01:24:37,915
And what if your superiors..

1583
01:24:38,039 --> 01:24:40,849
..Get an order from
their superiors, then?

1584
01:24:41,176 --> 01:24:42,917
We won't take a
second to stop the war.

1585
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:45,081
Then that's possible.

1586
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:50,489
You just have to help me.

1587
01:24:50,785 --> 01:24:52,890
I'm ready to help
you all your life.

1588
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:59,328
Just send me across the border.
- What?

1589
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:01,267
Across the border?

1590
01:25:02,797 --> 01:25:04,105
It's not the easy.

1591
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,781
But it's not that difficult either.

1592
01:25:29,424 --> 01:25:30,732
Contact Qureshi.

1593
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,442
Will everything be okay?

1594
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:48,813
Surprising it is.

1595
01:25:49,277 --> 01:25:51,223
Brave at one time, and the next..

1596
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:52,953
I don't know what will happen.

1597
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:55,760
To get you across we
need to stop the firing.

1598
01:25:56,217 --> 01:25:57,355
Hnece this is important.

1599
01:25:57,385 --> 01:25:58,420
Sir.

1600
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:09,508
Okay.

1601
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:11,272
What happened?
- Coming.

1602
01:26:12,033 --> 01:26:12,670
Get up!

1603
01:26:12,734 --> 01:26:14,680
Good for nothing fools.

1604
01:26:14,903 --> 01:26:16,007
Get up!

1605
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:19,340
Qureshi. Qureshi.

1606
01:26:19,774 --> 01:26:20,809
Captain Raj here.

1607
01:26:20,909 --> 01:26:22,752
Sir, why aren't you answering?
- Qureshi.

1608
01:26:23,478 --> 01:26:24,422
Where are you?

1609
01:26:24,445 --> 01:26:27,483
Friendship and war has its own place.
- Qureshi.

1610
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:30,423
But when it's about being
mannerless, I can't tolerate it.

1611
01:26:30,552 --> 01:26:32,122
Officer Qureshi.

1612
01:26:33,087 --> 01:26:34,930
Captain Qureshi.

1613
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:41,040
Respect lies in one's hand.

1614
01:26:43,965 --> 01:26:45,205
Speak, captain sir.

1615
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,437
Your oath's fulfilled.

1616
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:52,083
Madam wants to come
across for her reporting.

1617
01:26:59,347 --> 01:27:00,758
She's back for me.

1618
01:27:02,617 --> 01:27:05,962
Yes...l mean, that's good.

1619
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:07,700
Even we want peace.

1620
01:27:08,256 --> 01:27:09,291
And listen.

1621
01:27:09,524 --> 01:27:12,232
We're sending your
soldier Kabir Khatri along.

1622
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,301
You just need to take
care of Commander Khan.

1623
01:27:14,362 --> 01:27:15,466
Do one thing.

1624
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:18,336
Bring the reporter madam
at Location Sherlyn.

1625
01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:21,540
And then...send Khatri
at location Sawant.

1626
01:27:21,703 --> 01:27:23,239
I will handle Khan sir.

1627
01:27:23,438 --> 01:27:24,212
Okay.

1628
01:27:24,539 --> 01:27:27,486
What did you say her name was?

1629
01:27:29,644 --> 01:27:31,055
Madam Ruth dutta.

1630
01:27:35,116 --> 01:27:36,527
Madam Ruth...

1631
01:27:38,686 --> 01:27:40,131
Fine, send her soon.

1632
01:27:40,188 --> 01:27:41,565
Okay, we're leaving.

1633
01:27:43,358 --> 01:27:45,133
You just need to handle Qureshi.

1634
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:46,771
He's looking for a bride.

1635
01:27:50,365 --> 01:27:52,140
She's coming.

1636
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:54,607
Be obedient like a younger brother.

1637
01:27:55,870 --> 01:27:57,281
Lay out the table and chair.

1638
01:27:57,405 --> 01:27:59,385
And arrange for snacks.

1639
01:27:59,641 --> 01:28:00,415
Get it.

1640
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:01,545
You all wait here.

1641
01:28:01,576 --> 01:28:02,714
Ranjeet, you wait here too.

1642
01:28:03,311 --> 01:28:05,222
Me and Ruth madam will go ahead.

1643
01:28:12,553 --> 01:28:13,293
Sir.

1644
01:28:13,321 --> 01:28:15,130
We'll have to stop
firing for a while.

1645
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:16,494
But, we aren't firing?

1646
01:28:16,524 --> 01:28:19,266
Sir, we've to stop
whatever we're firing.

1647
01:28:19,694 --> 01:28:21,674
You've been bribed,
right. You've been bribed.

1648
01:28:21,763 --> 01:28:23,436
Sir, You're always cracking jokes.

1649
01:28:23,498 --> 01:28:25,136
This is why no one respects you.

1650
01:28:25,667 --> 01:28:26,805
What do you mean?

1651
01:28:27,001 --> 01:28:29,777
I mean Kabir Khatri was
stuck at the Indian border.

1652
01:28:29,904 --> 01:28:31,577
We told him to get out..

1653
01:28:31,606 --> 01:28:33,517
..But for that we
need to stop firing.

1654
01:28:33,941 --> 01:28:34,976
Do one thing Sir.

1655
01:28:35,076 --> 01:28:37,420
Go to Location Sawant
and receive him.

1656
01:28:37,912 --> 01:28:38,947
Come on.
- Let's go.

1657
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:40,220
Hold on.

1658
01:28:41,482 --> 01:28:42,586
Who's the senior?

1659
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:45,093
It's not about seniority.
- Speak to me.

1660
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:47,861
He only trusts you.

1661
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:49,691
Liar.

1662
01:28:50,358 --> 01:28:52,668
Sir, may you rot in
hell if I am lying.

1663
01:28:53,828 --> 01:28:54,863
Yes.

1664
01:28:54,929 --> 01:28:55,964
Lets Go.

1665
01:29:01,102 --> 01:29:02,513
Soldiers. Stop firing.

1666
01:29:03,638 --> 01:29:07,313
"There's a ruckus here."

1667
01:29:07,475 --> 01:29:11,082
"The entire world will see it."

1668
01:29:11,245 --> 01:29:14,715
"Where will they go tonight."

1669
01:29:14,949 --> 01:29:18,556
"I think they'll cut
the border wires."

1670
01:29:18,686 --> 01:29:20,927
"Let's forsake war."

1671
01:29:21,255 --> 01:29:22,859
"No point in awar."

1672
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:24,636
"Why is everyone so willing. War."

1673
01:29:24,859 --> 01:29:26,702
"Try to understand, War."

1674
01:29:26,894 --> 01:29:28,737
"Let's forsake war."

1675
01:29:28,896 --> 01:29:30,432
"No point in awar."

1676
01:29:30,765 --> 01:29:32,403
"Why is everyone so willing. War."

1677
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:36,013
"Try to understand."

1678
01:29:41,476 --> 01:29:45,117
"Everyone called
out from the heart."

1679
01:29:45,279 --> 01:29:49,022
"Let's do as we please."

1680
01:29:57,091 --> 01:30:00,538
"War at a moment
and friends at next."

1681
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:04,266
"Don't think it's a child's play."

1682
01:30:04,665 --> 01:30:08,272
"It becomes a
problem for everyone."

1683
01:30:08,469 --> 01:30:11,973
"It affects everyone."

1684
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:13,916
"Let's forsake war."

1685
01:30:13,975 --> 01:30:15,818
"No point in awar."

1686
01:30:15,843 --> 01:30:17,720
"Why is everyone so willing. War."

1687
01:30:17,779 --> 01:30:19,622
"Try to understand, War."

1688
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:21,557
"Let's forsake war."

1689
01:30:21,582 --> 01:30:23,493
"No point in awar."

1690
01:30:23,518 --> 01:30:25,327
"Why is everyone so willing. War."

1691
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:28,993
"Try to understand."

1692
01:30:42,804 --> 01:30:43,976
Madam.

1693
01:30:45,306 --> 01:30:47,547
I just wanted to say something.

1694
01:30:48,543 --> 01:30:49,613
Just one thing.

1695
01:30:52,513 --> 01:30:53,548
Yes.

1696
01:31:01,522 --> 01:31:02,466
L...

1697
01:31:02,523 --> 01:31:03,797
I... Thank you very much.

1698
01:31:05,059 --> 01:31:06,094
What for?

1699
01:31:07,662 --> 01:31:10,438
You saved my honour,
in front of my forces.

1700
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:15,204
In a fit of emotion, I swore
on bringing you on our side.

1701
01:31:15,837 --> 01:31:18,545
And you fulfilled my oath.

1702
01:31:20,541 --> 01:31:23,647
By the way, I should thank you too.

1703
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:27,683
You had said, "Madam,
we'll always honour you".

1704
01:31:28,816 --> 01:31:31,456
And you did.

1705
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:33,688
Shall we go?

1706
01:31:34,255 --> 01:31:35,290
Thank you.

1707
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:38,201
Thank you.
- See you Captain Qureshi.

1708
01:31:38,626 --> 01:31:39,696
Let's go.

1709
01:31:41,996 --> 01:31:44,476
Captain sir. I want to...

1710
01:31:50,004 --> 01:31:51,074
'--

1711
01:31:51,706 --> 01:31:55,153
Captain sir, I was saying..

1712
01:31:56,911 --> 01:31:59,255
It's a complicated matter.

1713
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:05,954
I had a talk with madam,
and came to point..

1714
01:32:07,255 --> 01:32:12,864
..That the madam loves you.

1715
01:32:19,467 --> 01:32:22,471
This hug doesn't mean
I'll let you off easy.

1716
01:32:22,937 --> 01:32:24,678
Get that. Be ready.

1717
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:26,912
I was born ready.

1718
01:32:29,944 --> 01:32:30,979
Allah be with you.

1719
01:32:57,705 --> 01:33:00,686
I want to tell my
Indian soldier brothers..

1720
01:33:01,309 --> 01:33:02,845
..We started this war.

1721
01:33:03,544 --> 01:33:04,648
It's our fault.

1722
01:33:04,912 --> 01:33:07,893
Please forgive your
younger brother.

1723
01:33:11,752 --> 01:33:13,095
We're Indians after all.

1724
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:16,902
If they don't fire, we won't fire.

1725
01:33:17,024 --> 01:33:19,595
Sir, is this video fake.

1726
01:33:20,194 --> 01:33:22,367
Are they planning to
do something secretly?

1727
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:26,400
No, their tears
showed their honesty.

1728
01:33:27,335 --> 01:33:29,906
I've seen them, heard them.

1729
01:33:31,339 --> 01:33:33,376
Look, brother. It's true.

1730
01:33:34,508 --> 01:33:37,819
We trusted them every time.
Let's trust them once more.

1731
01:33:37,845 --> 01:33:40,951
Okay, sir. And anyway,
they've stopped firing.

1732
01:33:41,515 --> 01:33:43,654
Sir! Sir!

1733
01:33:44,051 --> 01:33:45,121
We've been betrayed.

1734
01:33:45,286 --> 01:33:46,924
Something's happening at the back.

1735
01:33:47,455 --> 01:33:50,197
I think the Pakistani army is
trying to infiltrate from the back.

1736
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:53,704
Everyone will take their
positions, quickly. - Sir!

1737
01:33:58,299 --> 01:33:59,676
Surendar. Gun!

1738
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:15,959
Ohh! So, it's you.

1739
01:34:16,817 --> 01:34:18,819
Our herdsman did tell us about you.

1740
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:20,799
Was the map correct?

1741
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:23,162
By the way, where
are you coming from?

1742
01:34:25,292 --> 01:34:27,272
I said where are you coming from?

1743
01:34:27,294 --> 01:34:34,473
Jodhpur, herdsman.
Chocolate. Infiltration.

1744
01:34:35,136 --> 01:34:36,308
That goat.

1745
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:39,280
No, boy. You've been made a fool.

1746
01:34:39,407 --> 01:34:41,785
Brother. Brother.

1747
01:34:42,276 --> 01:34:44,381
Welcome. Welcome you two.

1748
01:34:44,712 --> 01:34:46,623
Now all of you kneel down. Come on.

1749
01:34:47,982 --> 01:34:51,122
When will you learn?

1750
01:34:51,719 --> 01:34:54,199
Sometimes you infiltrate
the neighbours, sometimes us.

1751
01:34:54,588 --> 01:34:56,226
And that's why you couldn't stop..

1752
01:34:56,257 --> 01:34:58,362
..The infiltration
in your own country.

1753
01:34:58,626 --> 01:34:59,934
Sir, we're helpless.

1754
01:34:59,994 --> 01:35:01,098
Oh, God.

1755
01:35:01,128 --> 01:35:04,598
I took the gun not for Islam
- There he goes again.

1756
01:35:05,299 --> 01:35:07,506
I did it for my family.

1757
01:35:09,003 --> 01:35:14,919
No infiltrator is born this way.

1758
01:35:16,143 --> 01:35:19,249
The world makes him one.

1759
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:22,454
Take him away before any director
spots him. - The people do make him

1760
01:35:22,783 --> 01:35:27,562
A real infiltrator can't
be recognised by anyone.

1761
01:35:27,588 --> 01:35:29,067
But you recognised me..

1762
01:35:29,190 --> 01:35:31,295
..Because you're
not an infiltrator.

1763
01:35:31,692 --> 01:35:33,035
I'm a better infiltrator.

1764
01:35:33,094 --> 01:35:34,129
What's this?

1765
01:35:34,295 --> 01:35:35,865
Two hearts are uniting here..

1766
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:37,534
..And they are scaling our walls.

1767
01:35:38,199 --> 01:35:40,236
Honestly, if we get the
orders to stop this war..

1768
01:35:40,334 --> 01:35:42,405
..L would invite my brothers over.

1769
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:45,047
They're fed up of
eating lentil and meat.

1770
01:35:45,673 --> 01:35:47,914
But, how do we stop this war.

1771
01:35:49,310 --> 01:35:50,721
Leave that to me.

1772
01:35:51,479 --> 01:35:53,982
The country has seen
enough fake breaking news.

1773
01:35:55,049 --> 01:35:57,825
Now we'll show them
real exclusive news.

1774
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:01,157
I just need some time.

1775
01:36:02,156 --> 01:36:03,601
You will have to
wait until morning.

1776
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:05,066
Dutta the warrior.

1777
01:36:05,559 --> 01:36:08,130
Move fast. We've to reach board.

1778
01:36:10,698 --> 01:36:11,733
C:.m O "2

1779
01:36:33,387 --> 01:36:37,961
"What seemed like a dream.."

1780
01:36:38,425 --> 01:36:42,874
"Has finally turned
to reality today."

1781
01:36:48,302 --> 01:36:52,808
"What seemed like a dream.."

1782
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:57,911
"Has finally turned
to reality today."

1783
01:36:58,445 --> 01:37:02,916
"The hope that was
alive in my heart."

1784
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:07,162
"Will finally show
its colors tomorrow."

1785
01:37:07,354 --> 01:37:16,798
"Everyone believes,
the dawn will come."

1786
01:37:17,331 --> 01:37:26,979
"Everyone believes,
the dawn will come."

1787
01:37:27,141 --> 01:37:29,121
.-We-re a storm."

1788
01:37:29,610 --> 01:37:36,926
"We know...what we're capable of."

1789
01:37:37,184 --> 01:37:41,291
"In any direction we march."

1790
01:37:42,056 --> 01:37:47,096
"We find a new route."

1791
01:37:47,428 --> 01:37:49,499
According to our sources..

1792
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:52,807
..This border battle between India-Pakistan
can turn into a full blown war.

1793
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:55,107
According to sources, the
war between India-Pakistan"

1794
01:37:55,202 --> 01:37:56,340
..might take a bigger turn.

1795
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:58,145
While the army's
policing the border..

1796
01:37:58,172 --> 01:37:59,674
Nobody from the ministry is
ready to speak on this issue.

1797
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:01,447
Home Ministry has issued
orders to all three forces.

1798
01:38:01,508 --> 01:38:03,510
The Air Force has been
kept on high alert..

1799
01:38:06,247 --> 01:38:07,885
We can still here
the shots being fired.

1800
01:38:08,048 --> 01:38:09,891
And assumptions have been made..

1801
01:38:21,395 --> 01:38:22,840
Rut. Where are you?

1802
01:38:22,930 --> 01:38:24,671
And why did live feed stopped?

1803
01:38:24,932 --> 01:38:26,912
Sir. There was a technical problem.

1804
01:38:26,934 --> 01:38:28,106
Is everything okay now?

1805
01:38:28,335 --> 01:38:31,646
Sir. I'm going to send you
a exclusive news. - Okay.

1806
01:38:31,805 --> 01:38:34,183
And the entire country
will be shaken by it.

1807
01:38:35,042 --> 01:38:36,521
Just one thing.

1808
01:38:36,577 --> 01:38:38,614
You have to show it 'live'.

1809
01:38:39,213 --> 01:38:40,021
Sure. Sure.

1810
01:38:40,047 --> 01:38:41,788
Such news will
definitely shown live.

1811
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:45,729
Okay, sir. Remember, no editing.

1812
01:38:45,819 --> 01:38:47,696
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure.

1813
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:51,997
Listen guys, live
news from the border.

1814
01:38:52,126 --> 01:38:54,697
I don't want any
interruption ...no editing.

1815
01:39:00,768 --> 01:39:03,874
Hello. I am Rut Datta.

1816
01:39:04,171 --> 01:39:08,847
And now, please watch the
following news very carefully.

1817
01:39:09,710 --> 01:39:13,351
Reporting from the border,
live from the heart.

1818
01:39:18,285 --> 01:39:21,164
Excuse me, is the camera on?

1819
01:39:21,922 --> 01:39:23,663
I'm very scared of these things.

1820
01:39:23,691 --> 01:39:28,265
What I'm going to say now
is a very confidential.

1821
01:39:28,362 --> 01:39:32,833
"When we've the courage
to say the truth."

1822
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:38,076
"Then why should we keep quiet?"

1823
01:39:38,405 --> 01:39:42,649
"It was a wall.."

1824
01:39:43,410 --> 01:39:47,881
only ...with a slight twist... that
this report release this report..

1825
01:39:47,948 --> 01:39:49,859
.. You'll show two
days later, as live.

1826
01:39:50,284 --> 01:39:51,888
After the war has been declared.

1827
01:39:52,853 --> 01:39:54,560
Oh ..What did we just played live?

1828
01:40:11,171 --> 01:40:12,343
I will ruin you.

1829
01:40:12,373 --> 01:40:13,818
I will destroy this channel.

1830
01:40:13,841 --> 01:40:15,445
You won't be able to do that, sir.

1831
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:18,718
This isn't your Ministry right?

1832
01:40:19,513 --> 01:40:21,117
It comes under our Ministry.

1833
01:40:21,315 --> 01:40:23,818
The Information and
Broadcast Ministry, sir.

1834
01:40:24,985 --> 01:40:28,194
So go on and try
saving your position.

1835
01:40:31,058 --> 01:40:32,298
And you, Mister.

1836
01:40:33,594 --> 01:40:36,370
Your channel, which
always shows the truth..

1837
01:40:36,930 --> 01:40:38,932
..Don't need people like you.

1838
01:40:40,801 --> 01:40:42,144
We don't want war.

1839
01:40:42,569 --> 01:40:45,311
Not just us soldiers, but
any Citizen of any country

1840
01:40:45,406 --> 01:40:46,578
..doesn't want a war.

1841
01:40:46,673 --> 01:40:49,153
And anyway, our country is
like your younger brother.

1842
01:40:49,676 --> 01:40:52,748
Forgive us.

1843
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:55,383
Give us Madhuri Dixit
and take Pakistan.

1844
01:40:55,549 --> 01:40:56,789
Now, there's a new one.

1845
01:40:57,284 --> 01:40:58,729
Give us Mallika Sherawat.

1846
01:40:58,886 --> 01:41:00,058
Oh come on?

1847
01:41:00,421 --> 01:41:01,832
Didn't we give you Sania Mirza?

1848
01:41:01,855 --> 01:41:03,027
Be happy with that.

1849
01:41:03,057 --> 01:41:05,298
I want to see India.

1850
01:41:05,826 --> 01:41:08,363
My father was in the army as well.

1851
01:41:09,396 --> 01:41:11,205
He attained martyrdom
five years ago.

1852
01:41:11,365 --> 01:41:14,471
What do they say?,
"Make love not war".

1853
01:41:15,169 --> 01:41:16,944
I've been getting so
many marriage proposals.

1854
01:41:17,271 --> 01:41:19,945
But, only if I get
a leave from here.

1855
01:41:20,174 --> 01:41:23,121
First, I first thing I want to
say to my Indian soldier brothers..

1856
01:41:23,143 --> 01:41:24,918
Is Salam-waal-ey-kum
..Sorry.

1857
01:41:24,945 --> 01:41:27,221
Namaste!.. is what I want to say.

1858
01:41:27,448 --> 01:41:32,796
And second, is that I want to
have a chicken feast with them.

1859
01:41:32,853 --> 01:41:34,230
I want war.

1860
01:41:35,089 --> 01:41:36,591
But only in cricket.

1861
01:41:36,990 --> 01:41:38,230
That never ends.

1862
01:41:38,525 --> 01:41:40,004
We don't know where to fire?

1863
01:41:40,594 --> 01:41:43,097
The superiors say
fire here, and we do.

1864
01:41:43,263 --> 01:41:44,503
They say fire there,
we do that too.

1865
01:41:44,565 --> 01:41:47,307
Why don't they understand
this small thing..

1866
01:41:47,501 --> 01:41:49,845
..That, if we fire
nuclear weapons on them..

1867
01:41:49,903 --> 01:41:52,383
..Will they shower flowers on us.

1868
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:54,876
What should I say more?

1869
01:41:54,908 --> 01:41:56,683
I just don't want a war.

1870
01:41:56,877 --> 01:41:58,117
There's just two ways.

1871
01:41:58,645 --> 01:42:01,091
First is love,
second with the sword.

1872
01:42:02,249 --> 01:42:04,923
The only difference is, that
the sword divides one into two..

1873
01:42:05,586 --> 01:42:08,089
..But love...unites two into one.

1874
01:42:08,188 --> 01:42:11,135
These borders which
have been chalked out..

1875
01:42:11,492 --> 01:42:14,132
..Between two countries, were
the deeds of emperors and rulers.

1876
01:42:14,828 --> 01:42:16,865
But these divisions shouldn't
make home in our hearts.

1877
01:42:17,131 --> 01:42:20,578
This isn't any breaking news, and
it's some exclusive sting operation.

1878
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:23,244
What you saw, is the truth..

1879
01:42:23,670 --> 01:42:30,019
..Which the people of India and
Pakistan always felt.. since ever!

1880
01:42:30,344 --> 01:42:33,382
It might sound weird, but
some super-power countries..

1881
01:42:33,547 --> 01:42:34,787
..Are making a fool of us.

1882
01:42:35,048 --> 01:42:36,994
But, maybe that's the truth.

1883
01:42:37,484 --> 01:42:38,986
But the truth is,
one super-power..

1884
01:42:39,186 --> 01:42:41,462
..Wants to attack
us through Pakistan..

1885
01:42:42,089 --> 01:42:43,159
..Whereas another super-power..

1886
01:42:43,357 --> 01:42:45,530
..Wants to cash on this
vulnerable situation of both of us.

1887
01:42:45,792 --> 01:42:47,601
Now, everything lies in your hands

1888
01:42:48,162 --> 01:42:50,005
Seems our media has
finally grown up today.

1889
01:42:50,297 --> 01:42:51,799
It's concerns your
future generation as well.

1890
01:42:51,899 --> 01:42:53,845
They've finally shown
the real power of media.

1891
01:42:54,401 --> 01:42:57,541
This is the place where
I did the chroma-shoot..

1892
01:42:58,071 --> 01:43:00,051
..Of our Excellency.

1893
01:43:00,641 --> 01:43:02,314
I've realized my mistake.

1894
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:05,620
Both the countries
are good friends.

1895
01:43:06,213 --> 01:43:08,193
No, in fact they were just one.

1896
01:43:08,582 --> 01:43:09,890
But, were divided into two.

1897
01:43:10,083 --> 01:43:11,858
And were given different colors.

1898
01:43:12,452 --> 01:43:14,864
We Pakistanis want peace.

1899
01:43:15,889 --> 01:43:18,460
Our people gets the
real picture gradually.

1900
01:43:27,434 --> 01:43:29,744
Citizens of both the countries
are out on the streets.

1901
01:43:29,803 --> 01:43:33,250
It's seem inevitable that
this war shall end soon.

1902
01:43:35,409 --> 01:43:39,118
I think, to take a stand against
these super-power countries..

1903
01:43:39,446 --> 01:43:41,153
..We should boycott
these products..

1904
01:43:41,248 --> 01:43:42,784
..With immediate effect.

1905
01:43:46,119 --> 01:43:49,760
No Chinese from today, and
fritters and stuffed bread is on.

1906
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:52,996
China infiltrated in
Ladakh 19 kilometers

1907
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:54,869
into our lndia..

1908
01:43:54,995 --> 01:43:57,532
See ..We don't war at all.

1909
01:43:58,131 --> 01:44:00,407
So From my side,
boycott Made In China.

1910
01:44:05,472 --> 01:44:07,474
No more selling China items.

1911
01:44:07,507 --> 01:44:08,781
Boycott Made in China.

1912
01:44:10,777 --> 01:44:12,723
Only If India-Pakistan
keep fighting..

1913
01:44:12,746 --> 01:44:14,419
..Will they be able to
sell their weapons to us.

1914
01:44:14,448 --> 01:44:16,894
I think the Ministers
are behind all this.

1915
01:44:17,084 --> 01:44:20,759
India and Pakistan should just
sit down and reach a truce.

1916
01:44:20,787 --> 01:44:22,733
I don't think that the common
people are happy with the war.

1917
01:44:22,756 --> 01:44:27,068
"The land changed,
and so did the sky."

1918
01:44:27,728 --> 01:44:32,609
"A new sun shall arise."

1919
01:44:32,733 --> 01:44:35,339
Now you see the people
out on the streets..

1920
01:44:35,836 --> 01:44:38,817
..It symbolizes that
this War will end soon.

1921
01:44:38,872 --> 01:44:40,510
What a revolution, man.

1922
01:44:41,208 --> 01:44:42,812
You do one thing.

1923
01:44:43,143 --> 01:44:45,487
Message everyone in
your friend's list.

1924
01:44:45,646 --> 01:44:47,990
Please boycott war completely.

1925
01:44:48,015 --> 01:44:50,859
I've already created a community.

1926
01:44:51,451 --> 01:44:52,657
'War Chhod Na Yaar.'

1927
01:45:00,761 --> 01:45:02,240
We're getting bad reports.

1928
01:45:02,729 --> 01:45:05,039
Cancel the arms deal
with India-Pakistan.

1929
01:45:05,065 --> 01:45:08,342
Mr. President, we'll
lose billions of dollars.

1930
01:45:08,402 --> 01:45:09,642
I'm in total mess, man.

1931
01:45:09,703 --> 01:45:11,182
I can't live without the
'Fafda'(Gujrati snacks).

1932
01:45:11,204 --> 01:45:12,649
We will boycott the war.

1933
01:45:12,773 --> 01:45:16,243
Guru! ...lndia has boycotted
Made In China products..

1934
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:19,689
..So it seems we'll have to end
this war, or we'll be ruined.

1935
01:45:19,846 --> 01:45:22,383
Just like no one
can destroy the sun..

1936
01:45:22,449 --> 01:45:25,362
..Similarly, no one
can defeat India.

1937
01:45:25,385 --> 01:45:27,365
Now Clap your hands.
- What are you saying?

1938
01:45:27,421 --> 01:45:28,832
The bomb has already
reached the border.

1939
01:45:28,855 --> 01:45:30,163
It must be heading
towards Delhi any minute.

1940
01:45:30,190 --> 01:45:32,761
Forget the war, and
let it bomb Islamabad.

1941
01:45:33,493 --> 01:45:34,733
What are you saying?

1942
01:45:34,761 --> 01:45:37,469
Just ask for milk and we'll give
porridge, but dare not ask for Kashmir..

1943
01:45:42,469 --> 01:45:43,743
This won't do.

1944
01:45:48,342 --> 01:45:50,288
Seems like his
translatorjust expired.

1945
01:45:50,877 --> 01:45:51,855
Curses.

1946
01:45:52,045 --> 01:45:55,390
Hey you guys, the guns deal is off.

1947
01:45:55,949 --> 01:45:57,223
Say something.

1948
01:45:57,384 --> 01:46:01,196
Mr. Shawn. - Sorry, baby. Not for you,
not for you.. not for anybody..

1949
01:46:01,254 --> 01:46:02,289
Sir...sir..

1950
01:46:02,322 --> 01:46:06,634
Now you go out there, and
stop that goddamn war, now.

1951
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:08,239
Hey guys, I am sorry.

1952
01:46:08,595 --> 01:46:11,075
The guns deal is off.

1953
01:46:11,832 --> 01:46:14,938
But...the airbase remains.

1954
01:46:15,302 --> 01:46:17,908
I feel like beating him black and blue.
- What is this?

1955
01:46:18,038 --> 01:46:19,483
Very good, you've learnt.

1956
01:46:19,539 --> 01:46:22,748
I would like to say, that
we strongly oppose the war..

1957
01:46:22,809 --> 01:46:24,345
..Between India and Pakistan.

1958
01:46:32,185 --> 01:46:34,722
The way people boycotted this war..

1959
01:46:34,855 --> 01:46:37,597
..It seems India and
Pakistan ministers..

1960
01:46:37,824 --> 01:46:40,236
..Will have to stop this war soon.

1961
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:41,703
So, who was effective today?

1962
01:46:42,129 --> 01:46:43,506
Jaat or Dutta?

1963
01:46:44,398 --> 01:46:45,968
Neither Jaat, nor Dutta.

1964
01:46:46,833 --> 01:46:47,868
It's the People.

1965
01:46:48,802 --> 01:46:51,442
Whenever the people join hands
 they're are always effective.

1966
01:46:55,609 --> 01:46:57,555
Cease fire. Hold your positions.

1967
01:47:04,751 --> 01:47:08,130
Stop. Stop. What do you want?

1968
01:47:09,055 --> 01:47:11,160
Where can I find commander Khan?

1969
01:47:11,525 --> 01:47:13,061
Here only but What do you want?

1970
01:47:13,193 --> 01:47:14,433
There's a parcel for him.

1971
01:47:17,531 --> 01:47:19,807
What's written on this
bomb, can any of you read it?

1972
01:47:20,066 --> 01:47:21,306
It's sounds like a shampoo.

1973
01:47:21,435 --> 01:47:22,539
Don't you know..

1974
01:47:22,869 --> 01:47:26,510
When this bomb explodes, it'll
give dandruff to millions.

1975
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:30,178
And all the Indians will go
crazy scratching their head.

1976
01:47:30,477 --> 01:47:34,550
That's when China will
launch a new shampoo.

1977
01:47:34,648 --> 01:47:35,683
Understood.

1978
01:47:35,849 --> 01:47:37,351
Sir, we don't need this now.

1979
01:47:38,018 --> 01:47:40,794
A full fledged war doesn't seems likely.
- Speak to me.. Buddy

1980
01:47:41,388 --> 01:47:43,334
Sir, our missiles have
not been tested yet.

1981
01:47:43,490 --> 01:47:45,436
And anyway this is
a missile-free bomb.

1982
01:47:45,659 --> 01:47:47,138
Just light the fuse at the back.

1983
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:49,436
The hatch will open from the front
and it will fire automatically.

1984
01:47:55,335 --> 01:47:57,246
Commander Khan.

1985
01:47:57,938 --> 01:47:59,076
Commander Khan.

1986
01:47:59,105 --> 01:48:00,209
Why are you taking my name?

1987
01:48:00,407 --> 01:48:01,647
Commander Khan.

1988
01:48:05,879 --> 01:48:07,517
Did you launch the bomb?

1989
01:48:07,547 --> 01:48:09,527
Not yet, but I've
lighted up the fuse.

1990
01:48:09,549 --> 01:48:11,028
On the Orders from the General.

1991
01:48:11,051 --> 01:48:13,759
To hell with the General?
- What is this? What is this?

1992
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:15,194
Someone put it out.

1993
01:48:15,255 --> 01:48:16,928
It's a live news-telecast, right?

1994
01:48:17,457 --> 01:48:19,368
I said, is this live-news?

1995
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:22,103
Yes, sir. Full live.

1996
01:48:22,596 --> 01:48:25,736
Call the fire-brigade.
- Fire-brigade.

1997
01:48:25,765 --> 01:48:28,302
Fire-brigade to douse a lousy fuse?
- So, shall I call the ambulance?

1998
01:48:28,502 --> 01:48:30,413
This is not someone's
home that's on fire.

1999
01:48:30,570 --> 01:48:32,447
Our home's are on fire, sir.

2000
01:48:32,739 --> 01:48:33,877
And Time has come to put it out.

2001
01:48:33,907 --> 01:48:37,081
The video tape you were
seeing a while ago..

2002
01:48:37,310 --> 01:48:38,721
..Was absolutely wrong.

2003
01:48:38,879 --> 01:48:39,914
It's not true.

2004
01:48:39,946 --> 01:48:41,391
Douse it. Douse it.

2005
01:48:41,781 --> 01:48:42,851
Douse it.

2006
01:48:44,551 --> 01:48:46,792
What did you do, sir? You
took out the fuse itself?

2007
01:48:47,087 --> 01:48:48,828
Now it'll explode here only.
- What?

2008
01:48:49,055 --> 01:48:50,056
Curses.

2009
01:48:50,090 --> 01:48:52,331
We're done for, sir.
- Run. Run.

2010
01:48:52,359 --> 01:48:54,896
This will explode here.
- You're deserting your army.

2011
01:48:55,262 --> 01:48:56,468
You're scared.

2012
01:48:56,863 --> 01:48:58,308
We're not scared of anyone.

2013
01:48:59,933 --> 01:49:01,435
Who fired?

2014
01:49:01,768 --> 01:49:04,112
Sir, I told you before.
This is the border.

2015
01:49:04,271 --> 01:49:05,875
Firing starts anytime

2016
01:49:05,906 --> 01:49:07,579
Please stop this war at any cost.

2017
01:49:08,041 --> 01:49:10,385
Who fired now? Let's go.

2018
01:49:10,410 --> 01:49:12,686
Sir! Wait!

2019
01:49:23,723 --> 01:49:24,997
Why are you all clapping?

2020
01:49:25,358 --> 01:49:27,531
Didn't you hear?
It's going to explode.

2021
01:49:28,428 --> 01:49:29,566
Sir.

2022
01:49:29,863 --> 01:49:32,070
Not speak to me.. let me hide!

2023
01:49:41,841 --> 01:49:46,221
Y4...Y5

2024
01:49:46,446 --> 01:49:48,926
Y 6.
- Think.

2025
01:49:48,949 --> 01:49:51,156
Y 7.
- Not you.

2026
01:49:51,685 --> 01:49:54,529
Y 8.
- Rascals.

2027
01:49:55,789 --> 01:49:57,735
Y

2028
01:49:58,959 --> 01:50:00,063
This..

2029
01:50:04,197 --> 01:50:11,342
"We'll never forsake
this friendship.."

2030
01:50:11,705 --> 01:50:17,781
"We'll give up our lives,
but never leave your side."

2031
01:50:17,944 --> 01:50:20,049
Bhutto, who's that girl?

2032
01:50:20,513 --> 01:50:27,397
"We'll never forsake
this friendship.."

2033
01:50:27,721 --> 01:50:31,168
"We'll give up our lives,
but never leave your side."
