1
00:03:43,493 --> 00:03:46,873
The salon count is more
than the population of this village.

2
00:03:47,385 --> 00:03:49,262
The owner doesn't
seem to understand.

3
00:03:49,352 --> 00:03:51,165
On the other hand...
- Excuse me, sir.

4
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:54,188
Hey, what are you doing?

5
00:03:54,647 --> 00:03:55,851
Freshen up.

6
00:03:56,085 --> 00:03:57,653
Please wait, sir,
I will do it myself.

7
00:03:57,743 --> 00:03:58,761
Okay.

8
00:04:00,143 --> 00:04:03,549
If you work when you are drunk, you
will slit someone's throat someday.

9
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:05,894
Look, I won't be in town
for a couple of days,

10
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:09,498
you need to go to the bungalow
to give the customer a haircut.

11
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:10,590
Okay?

12
00:04:13,465 --> 00:04:18,012
'I will tell you a story, I am
the hero, and she is the heroine.'

13
00:04:19,186 --> 00:04:21,933
'I did only one thing
to be called a hero,'

14
00:04:22,526 --> 00:04:23,712
'and that is falling in love
with the heroine.'

15
00:04:25,658 --> 00:04:28,055
'I became speechless,
whenever I looked at her.'

16
00:04:28,566 --> 00:04:29,551
'It was just music on my mind.'

17
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,841
'Like the other boyfriends,'

18
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:34,233
'I used to drop her to tuitions,
college and dance classes,'

19
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:37,283
'and she ditched me.'

20
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:54,671
'There can be several reasons
for a girl to ditch her boyfriend,'

21
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,413
'and the top three reasons are...'

22
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:03,405
'Money, money,'

23
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:04,779
'and money.'

24
00:05:05,342 --> 00:05:08,796
'Since I was unhappy
I slipped into depression.'

25
00:05:10,471 --> 00:05:13,908
'And, there is only one way
to come out of it.'

26
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:18,972
Death.

27
00:05:22,764 --> 00:05:24,764
Not mine, hers.

28
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:30,396
Now, she is married,
the coincidence is,

29
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,828
I have been asked to
to give her husband a haircut,

30
00:05:32,948 --> 00:05:33,935
the day after tomorrow.

31
00:05:34,823 --> 00:05:36,034
But, I will do it tomorrow.

32
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:40,194
Her husband is a local goon,

33
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:45,134
I don't need a plot to destroy him.

34
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:47,919
So, the plan is simple.

35
00:06:23,297 --> 00:06:24,695
'A watchman at the gate.'

36
00:06:24,913 --> 00:06:25,886
What do you want?

37
00:06:31,748 --> 00:06:32,750
Revenge.

38
00:06:33,507 --> 00:06:34,627
'Inside...'

39
00:06:34,717 --> 00:06:35,703
Jango!

40
00:06:39,925 --> 00:06:41,167
Take it!

41
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:03,848
'What does a girl do when
she receives flowers?'

42
00:07:05,488 --> 00:07:06,895
'She smells them.'

43
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,020
"The beautiful moon."

44
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,622
Sir, will you please guide me
to Ashok Bhavan estate?

45
00:11:44,757 --> 00:11:46,032
You want to go there?
- Yes.

46
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:47,884
Of course, you do.

47
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:49,920
Let's go. I live there.

48
00:11:50,038 --> 00:11:50,652
Oh.

49
00:11:50,742 --> 00:11:53,594
Do you have a rope to tie the bag?
- What?

50
00:11:53,716 --> 00:11:56,165
The bag is heavy.
- Oh.

51
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:11,777
Without my permission,

52
00:12:12,393 --> 00:12:14,839
not even an insect
can enter my premises,

53
00:12:15,453 --> 00:12:17,812
but you dared to do so,

54
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:20,745
to kill me.

55
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:26,478
'I don't think you know about
the history of this place.'

56
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,955
'I will tell you.'

57
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:36,064
'Once upon a time, there was
a dense forest.'

58
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,454
'There was a huge bungalow
in the middle of the forest,'

59
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,861
'with armed guards all around.'

60
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:50,006
'They had a boss,'

61
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:54,160
'his name is Tiger Ponnappa.'

62
00:12:56,093 --> 00:13:00,754
'He got that name
because he had a tiger as a pet,'

63
00:13:00,874 --> 00:13:02,867
'and a tattoo on his hand.'

64
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,677
'He used to hack
his enemies into pieces,'

65
00:13:07,797 --> 00:13:09,259
'and feed them to the tiger.'

66
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,938
'Everyone in the village
was scared of him,'

67
00:13:15,848 --> 00:13:18,031
'And, so,'

68
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,095
'the people obeyed him.'

69
00:13:21,726 --> 00:13:23,053
'During that time,'

70
00:13:23,982 --> 00:13:28,697
'a local goon came as his enemy,
fifteen years ago.'

71
00:13:31,907 --> 00:13:36,639
'He didn't take him seriously
thinking he was no match for him.'

72
00:13:52,043 --> 00:13:53,637
I am the goon.

73
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:56,621
'This is the bungalow.'

74
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:01,273
'I won't make the same mistake
which Tiger Ponnappa did.'

75
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,839
I want to know who sent you?

76
00:14:11,026 --> 00:14:14,231
Tell me who he is,
I will let you go.

77
00:14:24,908 --> 00:14:26,032
You won't say?

78
00:14:28,804 --> 00:14:30,200
Death.

79
00:14:32,248 --> 00:14:34,738
Even my men will grant you death.

80
00:15:40,263 --> 00:15:43,772
I have told you several times
to add extra sugar.

81
00:15:44,108 --> 00:15:47,628
I'm short-tempered, I want to control
my anger by taking extra sugar,

82
00:15:47,748 --> 00:15:49,421
but you don't understand.

83
00:15:50,021 --> 00:15:51,964
Make another cup of coffee,

84
00:15:52,415 --> 00:15:53,515
with extra sugar.

85
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:16,599
Boss,

86
00:16:17,874 --> 00:16:18,860
he is dead.

87
00:16:24,945 --> 00:16:27,121
Will you say or...
Take him and bring him.

88
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,208
Otherwise,

89
00:16:43,554 --> 00:16:45,289
pull out his gut.

90
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:50,737
It's been years
since Tiger Ponnappa died,

91
00:16:51,353 --> 00:16:54,771
but his men still come after us.

92
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,512
I'm sure there is someone
behind this.

93
00:16:59,022 --> 00:17:02,204
If we keep killing his men,

94
00:17:02,768 --> 00:17:04,838
even our children will grow old.

95
00:17:05,823 --> 00:17:07,779
There is only one option.

96
00:17:09,136 --> 00:17:10,911
We must kill him.

97
00:17:11,176 --> 00:17:13,162
We must kill him so brutally,

98
00:17:13,444 --> 00:17:16,598
that he must retain a memory of it,
in his next birth.

99
00:17:16,718 --> 00:17:20,999
We must have a story to tell
and people should fear us.

100
00:17:21,728 --> 00:17:23,060
That's our aim.

101
00:17:24,025 --> 00:17:27,165
And he will make it happen.

102
00:17:29,018 --> 00:17:32,901
Four of you will go there,
kill his men and get to him.

103
00:17:35,527 --> 00:17:40,191
He will decide who
those four men will be,

104
00:17:41,302 --> 00:17:42,630
and what they will do to him.

105
00:17:49,629 --> 00:17:51,733
Come for the audition, bring him.

106
00:18:03,897 --> 00:18:06,125
There should be
creativity in cruelty.

107
00:18:06,347 --> 00:18:07,653
Don't forget that.

108
00:18:07,835 --> 00:18:10,443
You won't get
such an opportunity again.

109
00:18:12,364 --> 00:18:16,162
Boss, I will stab him to death.

110
00:18:16,481 --> 00:18:17,519
He is not scared.

111
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:21,513
Before killing a person,
you must generate fear in him.

112
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:27,463
(Other language)

113
00:18:30,305 --> 00:18:31,319
No.

114
00:18:32,532 --> 00:18:33,426
You.

115
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:36,273
I will kill him with just one hit.

116
00:18:36,398 --> 00:18:37,526
Hold.

117
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:39,747
You.

118
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:42,960
The mantra of Lord Shiva
was first written by Ravana.

119
00:18:43,152 --> 00:18:47,374
He played lute using his throat
and sang praises of Lord Shiva.

120
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:51,351
I will play lute using his throat.

121
00:18:51,746 --> 00:18:54,349
I will like it.
You are going with me.

122
00:18:56,464 --> 00:19:00,676
Boss, I am not able
to express my thought.

123
00:19:01,062 --> 00:19:02,633
You stay here.

124
00:19:04,593 --> 00:19:05,798
You are also going with me.

125
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:08,785
You.

126
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:12,030
I will tie one leg to the jeep
and the other to the tree,

127
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,425
and drive away with the jeep.

128
00:19:13,515 --> 00:19:14,899
But I have a doubt.

129
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,326
Clear it over there.

130
00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:18,463
You also come with me.

131
00:19:20,386 --> 00:19:21,250
You.

132
00:19:21,992 --> 00:19:26,346
I will cut open his body, stitch it,

133
00:19:26,714 --> 00:19:29,300
do the same again,

134
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,190
and do the same...

135
00:19:33,963 --> 00:19:36,208
Stitch this by the time I am back.

136
00:19:39,129 --> 00:19:40,577
Put him in the jeep.

137
00:19:40,697 --> 00:19:41,680
Let's go.

138
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:49,695
Come.

139
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:02,061
Turn him around, come on.

140
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,774
Okay, I will do it.

141
00:20:13,585 --> 00:20:15,791
The jeep won't start, push it.

142
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,420
Push it.
- Come.

143
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:28,812
Push it harder.

144
00:20:30,628 --> 00:20:32,948
Now, push it from behind.
- Come on.

145
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,224
What about the other vehicle?
- It has a puncture.

146
00:21:44,808 --> 00:21:46,070
Come inside.

147
00:22:16,965 --> 00:22:18,339
My head is aching.

148
00:23:29,428 --> 00:23:31,150
The vegetables are expensive.

149
00:23:31,415 --> 00:23:35,079
I told ma'am to grow vegetables
outside the house.

150
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,473
Who is she?
- The boss's wife.

151
00:23:38,002 --> 00:23:39,060
Are you married?

152
00:23:39,234 --> 00:23:40,474
No.
- No?

153
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:42,218
I am unmarried too.

154
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:46,992
I rejected a proposal since
the girl didn't know to cook,

155
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,048
and the other girls refused
to marry me because I am a cook.

156
00:23:51,468 --> 00:23:52,596
I see.

157
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,522
A girl comes to clean dishes...

158
00:23:54,698 --> 00:23:56,554
She is beautiful.

159
00:23:57,115 --> 00:24:00,017
I wanted to marry her,
but the boss didn't grant leave.

160
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:01,024
Oh.

161
00:24:01,237 --> 00:24:05,736
Hence, I gave up
the idea of marriage.

162
00:24:06,035 --> 00:24:07,033
Doesn't he allow you
to even sleep with a woman?

163
00:24:07,211 --> 00:24:10,057
We can't make noise at that time,

164
00:24:10,447 --> 00:24:11,681
then what is the point
in getting married?

165
00:24:11,801 --> 00:24:12,937
That's right.

166
00:24:13,178 --> 00:24:14,814
Did you cut your own hair?

167
00:24:15,404 --> 00:24:17,321
Did you cut your own hair?
- Yes.

168
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:19,143
Please don't mind me.

169
00:24:19,936 --> 00:24:21,350
Are you a vegetarian
or a non-vegetarian?

170
00:24:21,571 --> 00:24:22,404
Both.

171
00:24:24,469 --> 00:24:25,956
They are going somewhere.

172
00:24:26,325 --> 00:24:28,220
They will never reform.

173
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,075
I don't understand a thing.

174
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,538
Doesn't Tiger Ponnappa
have a family?

175
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:42,741
He did have one, but not anymore.

176
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:43,950
Why?

177
00:24:44,488 --> 00:24:47,003
We killed Tiger's family
during the attack,

178
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:49,220
and buried them a few miles
away from here.

179
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:54,651
The boss instructed us,

180
00:24:54,741 --> 00:24:58,681
not to spare anyone in the family
and also not to use guns.

181
00:24:59,023 --> 00:25:00,767
Everyone was brutally beaten.

182
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:02,598
The floor has been painted red,

183
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,658
as we were unable to
get rid of the bloodstains.

184
00:25:06,567 --> 00:25:07,994
I have another doubt.

185
00:25:08,267 --> 00:25:09,499
What is it?

186
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:12,599
Why does only
the boss have a tattoo?

187
00:25:12,977 --> 00:25:15,432
Why don't we get tattooed too?

188
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:18,215
Only the gang leader
should have a tattoo,

189
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:20,592
only then will there
be a difference.

190
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,529
Did Tiger Ponnappa have a tattoo?
- Of course.

191
00:25:24,011 --> 00:25:24,900
What tattoo?

192
00:25:25,151 --> 00:25:26,973
Will a tiger have a cat's tattoo?

193
00:25:27,212 --> 00:25:28,570
Obviously, a tiger tattoo.

194
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:30,812
You are right.

195
00:25:31,654 --> 00:25:33,367
How many members
were there in his family?

196
00:25:37,562 --> 00:25:39,176
You should have come
half-an-hour earlier,

197
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,230
you could have had pilaf.

198
00:25:43,066 --> 00:25:44,728
I am coming.

199
00:25:44,891 --> 00:25:48,947
I think they are hungry,
they are waiting for me.

200
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:50,599
How many people
are there in the house?

201
00:25:50,891 --> 00:25:53,504
I am not sure,
there are very few people now,

202
00:25:54,322 --> 00:25:55,644
the writer will be able to tell you,

203
00:25:55,918 --> 00:25:59,459
how many people live in this house
and what they do. It's on the map.

204
00:25:59,945 --> 00:26:01,472
Take a look at it.

205
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:02,676
Stop there!

206
00:26:03,337 --> 00:26:04,267
Stop there!

207
00:26:04,434 --> 00:26:05,843
Idiot!

208
00:26:07,284 --> 00:26:08,932
You come in making noise!

209
00:26:09,045 --> 00:26:10,621
You know the boss
is asleep, don't you?

210
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:12,138
What do you mean?

211
00:26:12,228 --> 00:26:14,134
A bike is bound to make noise.

212
00:26:14,255 --> 00:26:15,106
It's a bullet bike.

213
00:26:15,328 --> 00:26:16,855
I see.
- Scissors.

214
00:26:17,112 --> 00:26:18,764
Well...
- He can't use a gun to cut hair.

215
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:23,429
Give it to me. Go.

216
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:25,833
Give it to me.
- You won't get it back.

217
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:29,629
Darn it!

218
00:26:29,813 --> 00:26:31,947
Push the bike.

219
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:33,854
Take it.

220
00:26:33,944 --> 00:26:34,898
Come on.

221
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,449
Come, sir.

222
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:39,152
Come.
- Be careful.

223
00:26:39,443 --> 00:26:42,018
You know what happened that day.
- Yes, I do.

224
00:26:43,264 --> 00:26:44,971
Boss likes bullets,

225
00:26:45,116 --> 00:26:46,925
but the one in the gun.

226
00:26:47,015 --> 00:26:48,042
What happened that day?

227
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,322
Nothing.

228
00:26:49,606 --> 00:26:51,119
A barber was here,

229
00:26:51,442 --> 00:26:54,237
he nicked the boss's lip
while trimming his moustache.

230
00:26:54,357 --> 00:26:55,762
You see the jackfruit tree there?

231
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:59,432
He was hung on that tree.

232
00:26:59,668 --> 00:27:01,306
That is all. Watch out.

233
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,619
Park the bike there and come inside.

234
00:27:07,629 --> 00:27:10,095
Come help me cook.

235
00:27:17,106 --> 00:27:18,316
Come sit.

236
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,615
You are here, come.

237
00:28:21,811 --> 00:28:23,060
I would need it.

238
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:43,085
Ma'am, he is here
to give a haircut to the boss.

239
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,977
He is tired,
ask him to come tomorrow.

240
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,524
He is tired all the time.

241
00:28:49,774 --> 00:28:52,087
This is not for you.
Please come tomorrow.

242
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:54,521
Boss is tired, send him back.

243
00:29:32,684 --> 00:29:35,347
Ask him to sit inside,
the boss might wake up in some time.

244
00:29:35,589 --> 00:29:37,646
He has to wake up.

245
00:29:38,357 --> 00:29:39,736
Come in.

246
00:30:03,094 --> 00:30:06,655
Who dropped the salt on the floor?

247
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,843
How are you?

248
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,498
I am fine.

249
00:30:16,623 --> 00:30:18,471
Won't you ask me how I am?

250
00:30:21,939 --> 00:30:24,676
I am sure you're doing well.

251
00:30:25,948 --> 00:30:29,302
A big house, several guards.

252
00:30:30,191 --> 00:30:32,229
You also have a crocodile as pet.

253
00:30:32,962 --> 00:30:34,550
Are you both school friends?

254
00:30:35,313 --> 00:30:36,764
Are you both school friends?

255
00:30:36,854 --> 00:30:40,457
Ma'am, I met a school friend
at the fish market.

256
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,665
I thought she was there to buy fish,

257
00:30:42,755 --> 00:30:44,527
but it was her shop.

258
00:30:44,752 --> 00:30:46,053
She is still beautiful.

259
00:30:46,316 --> 00:30:47,670
But I didn't speak to her.

260
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,790
Ask me why.
- Why?

261
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,039
Because the fish was not good.

262
00:30:50,269 --> 00:30:52,677
Go get something for him to eat.
- Okay.

263
00:30:52,816 --> 00:30:53,634
No, thanks.

264
00:30:53,724 --> 00:30:55,144
She...
- Get something for me.

265
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:57,122
She won't allow me even to talk.

266
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,521
You are here?
- What is it?

267
00:30:59,699 --> 00:31:01,196
Where is the cooker whistle?
- I don't know.

268
00:31:01,955 --> 00:31:02,890
Where is it?

269
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,978
I couldn't recognize you.

270
00:31:05,182 --> 00:31:06,566
You have changed so much.

271
00:31:06,686 --> 00:31:08,782
I did well after you left.

272
00:31:09,684 --> 00:31:12,043
But I am still the same.

273
00:31:13,045 --> 00:31:14,451
You are getting old.

274
00:31:15,257 --> 00:31:16,550
Not at all.

275
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,381
There is a change in my complexion.

276
00:31:19,729 --> 00:31:22,310
You are mistaken.

277
00:31:25,126 --> 00:31:27,334
We have met after so long.

278
00:31:29,016 --> 00:31:30,456
We are meeting for the last time.

279
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:31,974
What?
- Nothing.

280
00:31:32,064 --> 00:31:33,441
You never thought
We would meet, isn't it?

281
00:31:34,391 --> 00:31:36,816
I did think we will meet,
but I was not hopeful.

282
00:31:37,497 --> 00:31:38,646
By the way,

283
00:31:38,842 --> 00:31:40,321
why are you still unmarried?

284
00:31:40,828 --> 00:31:41,852
How did you know?

285
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:45,737
Because you have no toe ring.

286
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:47,142
I simply guessed.

287
00:31:47,442 --> 00:31:49,285
You look shabby in a beard.

288
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:51,585
I don't have a paunch
like your husband.

289
00:31:51,754 --> 00:31:54,729
Everyone said
I look like a movie star,

290
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:57,278
I guess that's why she fell for me.

291
00:31:57,368 --> 00:31:59,500
But she didn't profess
her love to me.

292
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:01,613
You are fortunate.
- Have you fallen in love?

293
00:32:07,695 --> 00:32:10,159
Ma'am, where is the cooker whistle?

294
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,389
I don't know.

295
00:32:12,577 --> 00:32:14,610
I cannot find it.

296
00:32:16,906 --> 00:32:17,718
Hello.

297
00:32:17,873 --> 00:32:19,060
Do you want money?

298
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,075
What is it?

299
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,437
I want hot water.

300
00:32:32,222 --> 00:32:34,239
He is a doctor, let him in.

301
00:32:34,355 --> 00:32:35,238
I did tell you.

302
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:37,649
Excuse me.
- I told you he is coming.

303
00:32:57,112 --> 00:32:58,174
Oh, no!

304
00:34:24,192 --> 00:34:25,879
Oh, it's you.

305
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,649
I was here to check
on the hot water.

306
00:34:28,948 --> 00:34:30,434
Sit down, I will get it.

307
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,836
Why are you here?

308
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:36,059
Where is the senior doctor?

309
00:34:36,211 --> 00:34:38,210
His daughter is getting married.
- Oh.

310
00:34:38,478 --> 00:34:40,347
Are you married?
- No.

311
00:34:41,242 --> 00:34:44,261
There is a maid in our house,

312
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:47,482
she's beautiful.
I will tell you about her later.

313
00:34:47,732 --> 00:34:50,068
I hope you don't mind.
- Not at all.

314
00:34:50,273 --> 00:34:52,399
Doctor, you know what?

315
00:34:53,152 --> 00:34:55,308
She hasn't eaten since three days,

316
00:34:55,869 --> 00:34:57,195
she looks dull.

317
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:59,765
Don't worry, I will treat her.

318
00:35:00,148 --> 00:35:02,079
She probably has a bad stomach.

319
00:35:02,289 --> 00:35:05,458
She only eats the food served by us.

320
00:35:05,776 --> 00:35:07,557
I will give her an injection.

321
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,331
Okay.

322
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,705
Feed her only millet soup
for three days.

323
00:35:11,827 --> 00:35:13,790
She isn't a dog
to have millet soup.

324
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,327
Then?
- She is a crocodile.

325
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:16,565
What?

326
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:19,316
Yes, she is a crocodile.

327
00:35:19,435 --> 00:35:23,270
The senior is aware of it,
but you are not.

328
00:35:24,093 --> 00:35:26,346
Why didn't you tell me?
- Doctor, don't go.

329
00:35:27,317 --> 00:35:29,883
Please let me go.
I thought it was a dog.

330
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,076
Hey.

331
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,211
If the crocodile
doesn't eat food by evening,

332
00:35:36,331 --> 00:35:37,533
you will be finished.

333
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:42,092
Don't be afraid,
it won't bite you, come.

334
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,476
Come, doctor. It's our pet.

335
00:36:10,405 --> 00:36:11,585
You are in this business?

336
00:36:11,675 --> 00:36:13,054
No, it's a job.

337
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:16,751
You were shaking even when
you held my hand for the first time.

338
00:36:19,816 --> 00:36:21,030
You are making a mistake.

339
00:36:21,182 --> 00:36:23,951
You were scared that day
thinking I will mistake you.

340
00:36:24,297 --> 00:36:25,905
And today?
- I will hold its mouth,

341
00:36:26,025 --> 00:36:27,753
give the injection.

342
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:32,709
Ma'am, where is Bubby?

343
00:36:33,138 --> 00:36:34,052
Over there.

344
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:35,866
You're here.

345
00:36:36,065 --> 00:36:37,509
Bubby, come.

346
00:36:37,675 --> 00:36:38,945
Doctor, she's here, come.

347
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:44,565
Come, doctor. Don't be afraid.

348
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:46,734
It's Tuesday today,

349
00:36:47,181 --> 00:36:48,667
he won't have a haircut.

350
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,273
Oh. Is it Tuesday today?

351
00:36:51,094 --> 00:36:52,756
I won't cut my hair, either.

352
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,717
I will come tomorrow.

353
00:37:01,323 --> 00:37:05,050
But you haven't done the job yet.

354
00:37:06,146 --> 00:37:09,400
I... I have other work to do.

355
00:37:11,053 --> 00:37:12,184
Come in.

356
00:37:12,304 --> 00:37:14,090
No, I will come tomorrow.

357
00:37:14,662 --> 00:37:16,993
I said come.
- Not today, tomorrow.

358
00:37:18,521 --> 00:37:20,210
You're here to give him a haircut,

359
00:37:20,345 --> 00:37:22,280
you might get into trouble
if he finds out,

360
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,677
that you left without doing it.

361
00:37:25,084 --> 00:37:26,441
Come.
- Trouble?

362
00:37:26,566 --> 00:37:28,061
Hey... She left.

363
00:37:30,111 --> 00:37:31,152
Oh, God!

364
00:37:42,365 --> 00:37:43,114
Hello, sir.

365
00:37:43,391 --> 00:37:44,310
Close the door.

366
00:37:47,889 --> 00:37:49,318
Should I bolt it?

367
00:37:51,106 --> 00:37:52,221
No?

368
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,473
Should I do it right here?
- Yes.

369
00:38:06,629 --> 00:38:09,165
The cream.
I can't find the blade.

370
00:38:14,654 --> 00:38:16,278
Yes, I am ready.

371
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:18,080
Wake him up.

372
00:38:19,868 --> 00:38:21,075
I?
- Yes.

373
00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:23,914
Okay.

374
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,159
Very good morning, sir.

375
00:38:37,292 --> 00:38:38,141
Sir.

376
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:41,525
He's not waking up.

377
00:38:44,252 --> 00:38:45,743
Darn it!

378
00:38:48,044 --> 00:38:48,981
Sir!

379
00:39:03,946 --> 00:39:05,285
Quiet!

380
00:39:05,613 --> 00:39:06,758
Quiet!

381
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,193
Quiet!

382
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:11,206
Shut your mouth!

383
00:39:13,169 --> 00:39:14,807
Don't scream.

384
00:39:20,307 --> 00:39:21,285
Drink it.

385
00:39:43,793 --> 00:39:45,223
Will you again,

386
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:50,293
ask me if I am doing fine?

387
00:39:51,691 --> 00:39:52,817
Please.

388
00:39:54,387 --> 00:39:55,808
How are you?

389
00:39:56,445 --> 00:39:58,070
Ever since I got married,

390
00:39:58,674 --> 00:40:01,130
it was the only moment
I felt I was happy.

391
00:40:04,942 --> 00:40:07,020
Until then, I was only grieving.

392
00:40:08,413 --> 00:40:10,103
I was grieving,

393
00:40:11,962 --> 00:40:13,301
and he was having fun.

394
00:43:41,576 --> 00:43:43,990
I was going through hell
every day in our house.

395
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:47,291
This was the only way,

396
00:43:47,761 --> 00:43:49,566
to come out of hell.

397
00:43:49,944 --> 00:43:50,899
Death,

398
00:43:51,906 --> 00:43:53,360
not mine,

399
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:56,092
but his.

400
00:44:39,562 --> 00:44:40,513
No!

401
00:44:41,681 --> 00:44:43,232
Oh, my God!

402
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,263
It was a close shave.

403
00:44:48,831 --> 00:44:49,754
Hey...

404
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,562
Sorry, sir.

405
00:44:54,374 --> 00:44:56,086
He is dead.

406
00:44:56,557 --> 00:44:57,835
I still don't want to take a risk.

407
00:45:00,983 --> 00:45:02,663
Ma'am, where is the cooker whistle?

408
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:04,760
Was he looking for this,
all this while?

409
00:45:11,266 --> 00:45:14,618
I was wondering
why the boss has fallen silent.

410
00:45:15,642 --> 00:45:17,581
The cooker whistle is here.

411
00:45:38,258 --> 00:45:39,754
I found the cooker whistle.

412
00:45:40,001 --> 00:45:41,585
Ningi?

413
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:43,452
Where is she?

414
00:45:43,787 --> 00:45:46,482
He saw it, what will you do?

415
00:45:51,763 --> 00:45:54,665
Ask me what we both are going to do.

416
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,005
He saw us both with the body.

417
00:45:59,584 --> 00:46:01,193
What do we do?

418
00:46:03,191 --> 00:46:05,097
Kill him.

419
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:09,960
Another murder? No!

420
00:46:15,598 --> 00:46:18,536
Oh, no, God.

421
00:46:21,929 --> 00:46:22,908
This one?

422
00:46:23,023 --> 00:46:24,421
Lord?
- Or this one?

423
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:25,828
This.

424
00:46:26,149 --> 00:46:26,943
Ma'am,

425
00:46:27,227 --> 00:46:28,183
I have an idea.

426
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,465
What if you chop, sir to pieces
and bury him?

427
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:39,411
The people from the bank
are torturing me.

428
00:46:39,969 --> 00:46:40,877
Why?

429
00:46:41,471 --> 00:46:43,038
They are refusing to give a loan
to our profession.

430
00:46:43,128 --> 00:46:44,948
Don't they fear us?
- Yes, they do.

431
00:46:45,038 --> 00:46:46,471
They fear we might
not repay the loan.

432
00:46:48,603 --> 00:46:49,848
Sir, why do you want to take a loan?

433
00:46:50,006 --> 00:46:52,384
I had taken a loan from someone
when I was getting married.

434
00:46:52,683 --> 00:46:54,363
This month I have to repay it.

435
00:46:54,764 --> 00:46:56,322
If I don't pay...
You know what the boss will do.

436
00:46:57,378 --> 00:46:58,405
I thought...

437
00:46:58,541 --> 00:47:00,564
Your name was written on the
recovery list for next month.

438
00:47:00,804 --> 00:47:01,856
Is it?

439
00:47:02,181 --> 00:47:03,134
Don't worry.

440
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:06,498
He says he will reward us
if we kill his boss.

441
00:47:06,631 --> 00:47:09,204
We have to kill, sir,
before he wakes up.

442
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,685
Hey, don't push.
Get inside the jeep.

443
00:47:12,807 --> 00:47:14,277
Doctor, come on, inject it.

444
00:47:15,439 --> 00:47:17,131
Have you held its mouth tight?
- Yes.

445
00:47:17,221 --> 00:47:19,554
Bubby doesn't harm anyone.
Am I right, Bubby?

446
00:47:20,533 --> 00:47:22,136
Doctor, it said, yes.

447
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:24,709
Yes.

448
00:47:29,341 --> 00:47:32,106
Come on, inject it. Yes.

449
00:47:32,356 --> 00:47:34,152
Are you done?

450
00:47:35,787 --> 00:47:37,388
'Ravana who lived
in a golden palace,'

451
00:47:38,588 --> 00:47:41,099
'was mighty and strong.'

452
00:47:42,765 --> 00:47:45,751
'He used to follow
the path of justice.'

453
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,975
'He would perform his duties...'

454
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:49,694
You can eat only after Bubby eats.

455
00:47:50,255 --> 00:47:53,220
'He believed truth to be mightier.'

456
00:47:54,191 --> 00:47:56,927
'He would never spare his enemies.'

457
00:47:58,522 --> 00:48:01,730
'He believed in
sincerity and honesty.'

458
00:48:03,207 --> 00:48:06,076
'He considered truth
to be his life.'

459
00:48:07,025 --> 00:48:09,038
'He would never...'

460
00:48:09,128 --> 00:48:10,839
Is there only one egg for me?

461
00:48:11,286 --> 00:48:12,678
I will complain to the writer.

462
00:48:13,452 --> 00:48:16,210
'The sin...'

463
00:48:43,448 --> 00:48:44,344
Writer,

464
00:48:44,747 --> 00:48:46,268
will I get only one egg?

465
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:50,149
This won't be enough for me.
I want more.

466
00:48:50,488 --> 00:48:51,902
Get the boss's signature.

467
00:48:52,021 --> 00:48:54,022
I will go complain to the boss.

468
00:48:55,585 --> 00:48:56,866
Is boss sleeping?
- Yes.

469
00:48:57,051 --> 00:48:57,849
He is in deep sleep.

470
00:48:58,059 --> 00:48:59,650
What special did you get?
- Pudding.

471
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:01,487
Pudding? For what?

472
00:49:01,577 --> 00:49:02,815
I begot a son.

473
00:49:03,052 --> 00:49:05,249
Did you make it?
I was asking about the pudding.

474
00:49:05,382 --> 00:49:06,272
Sit here.

475
00:49:08,301 --> 00:49:09,162
Take this.

476
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:15,289
Boss?

477
00:49:20,093 --> 00:49:21,053
He is here.

478
00:49:21,143 --> 00:49:22,853
Boss, he has brought pudding.
Do you want to eat some?

479
00:49:26,984 --> 00:49:29,038
Oh, you don't want it? Okay.

480
00:49:33,399 --> 00:49:35,180
He doesn't want it.
You do this,

481
00:49:35,397 --> 00:49:36,772
get it after eleven days.

482
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,274
It will be good if you get
fritters.

483
00:49:38,364 --> 00:49:39,363
Okay.
- I shall leave.

484
00:49:57,879 --> 00:49:59,098
Are you crying?

485
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,759
Hey, don't cry.

486
00:50:24,189 --> 00:50:25,389
Calm down.

487
00:50:27,545 --> 00:50:28,413
Don't cry.

488
00:50:31,169 --> 00:50:32,996
Seeing you cry, even I'll cry.
Please don't cry.

489
00:51:11,213 --> 00:51:12,506
Take this.

490
00:51:16,276 --> 00:51:17,453
Chop him up.

491
00:51:21,399 --> 00:51:23,444
No, we will think of another idea.

492
00:51:23,938 --> 00:51:26,333
"The work you're doing..."

493
00:51:27,944 --> 00:51:29,809
"The mud will..."

494
00:51:30,127 --> 00:51:31,886
Basha, come. What happened?

495
00:51:32,358 --> 00:51:35,190
He touched sister-in-law's hand
while she was shopping for clothes.

496
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,520
Scoundrel.

497
00:51:36,765 --> 00:51:37,678
What is it?

498
00:51:38,062 --> 00:51:39,508
Pudding.
- Serve me some.

499
00:51:45,273 --> 00:51:46,312
Did boss have?

500
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:48,559
Forget eating,
he didn't come out and talk to me.

501
00:51:49,323 --> 00:51:50,331
Was he sleeping?

502
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:23,484
Boss.

503
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:50,535
What is the idea?

504
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:52,461
I need some more time to think.

505
00:52:52,715 --> 00:52:53,702
What?

506
00:53:05,268 --> 00:53:06,232
Where is boss?

507
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:07,647
No, sir.

508
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,334
Sit straight.

509
00:53:14,725 --> 00:53:16,275
Sir, do you want it to slope
or straight?

510
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,082
Slope?

511
00:53:18,492 --> 00:53:19,294
He wants slope.

512
00:53:19,518 --> 00:53:20,961
Hey, come here.

513
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:24,658
What is it?

514
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:28,213
What happened?
- Bubby didn't have food.

515
00:53:28,927 --> 00:53:29,695
Come here.

516
00:53:30,185 --> 00:53:31,887
There are three people at the gate.

517
00:53:32,648 --> 00:53:34,350
There ten bodyguards
around the house.

518
00:53:34,851 --> 00:53:36,634
Moreover, there is a crocodile,

519
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:40,170
but she killed you with a cooker.

520
00:53:41,347 --> 00:53:44,260
Had you left the girl,
you wouldn't have met this fate.

521
00:53:44,774 --> 00:53:46,730
He didn't elope
with your girlfriend.

522
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:48,473
You left her.

523
00:53:49,382 --> 00:53:50,674
I didn't leave her.

524
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:54,122
I said I need some time to marry
you as I incurred loss in business.

525
00:53:54,662 --> 00:53:56,306
Yes, you left me.

526
00:53:57,147 --> 00:53:58,180
No matter what it is,

527
00:53:58,378 --> 00:54:01,036
no one other than me can
handle an insane woman like you.

528
00:54:01,126 --> 00:54:02,925
Hello? Who is insane?

529
00:54:03,085 --> 00:54:04,151
You. Who else?

530
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,271
Look here.

531
00:54:05,761 --> 00:54:08,030
Instead of applying vermillion dot,
You have placed the cooker whistle.

532
00:54:09,383 --> 00:54:11,011
I have seen twenty-eight
and a half movies,

533
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:13,153
but there were not many twists and
turns in it as he has in his life.

534
00:54:13,562 --> 00:54:15,313
Keep your head straight, please.
- Twenty-eight and a half?

535
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,740
Yes.

536
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:21,058
You were upset with me and
left the theatre midway.

537
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:24,341
I didn't go away.

538
00:54:25,072 --> 00:54:28,236
I waited outside for a long time
thinking you would come.

539
00:54:28,975 --> 00:54:31,309
Oh, sorry. I had bought
a balcony ticket,

540
00:54:31,896 --> 00:54:33,207
that too in black.

541
00:54:35,072 --> 00:54:36,785
Are you still crazy about movies?

542
00:54:37,248 --> 00:54:39,529
No, I understood later,

543
00:54:40,035 --> 00:54:42,524
that the actual fun was not
in watching movies,

544
00:54:43,022 --> 00:54:44,510
but watching it with you.

545
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,784
Think about it, I still have to
watch half of the movie.

546
00:54:49,065 --> 00:54:50,065
We can watch it together.

547
00:54:51,649 --> 00:54:53,063
Don't say the same thing again.

548
00:54:54,009 --> 00:54:56,896
The ideas that you have
may delay my death for some time,

549
00:54:57,257 --> 00:54:58,620
but I can't escape from it.

550
00:55:00,178 --> 00:55:02,991
If we both run away,
they will find us and kill us.

551
00:55:03,515 --> 00:55:05,993
At least by the time they find us...
- Don't come closer.

552
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:07,430
Are you out of your mind?

553
00:55:11,966 --> 00:55:13,228
Actually, yes.

554
00:55:13,575 --> 00:55:14,716
Now, I am feeling better.

555
00:55:15,141 --> 00:55:16,079
You do this...

556
00:55:16,326 --> 00:55:17,648
Make sure
he doesn't get bored.

557
00:55:17,832 --> 00:55:18,863
Sir, don't mind.

558
00:55:19,246 --> 00:55:20,206
I'll be back.

559
00:55:20,479 --> 00:55:21,148
Hey.
- Yes.

560
00:55:21,321 --> 00:55:24,375
Where are you going? Stop!
- I can't stop. I won't.

561
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,300
Ningi!

562
00:55:33,548 --> 00:55:34,627
What is it?

563
00:55:34,819 --> 00:55:35,930
Huccha is coming this way.

564
00:55:37,371 --> 00:55:39,240
Grind these spices for the pilaf...

565
00:55:39,499 --> 00:55:40,925
I don't know how to grind it.

566
00:55:41,073 --> 00:55:43,712
I am with you, I'll help you.

567
00:55:43,989 --> 00:55:44,862
Go away!

568
00:55:45,074 --> 00:55:46,828
I have done my work,
I'm going home.

569
00:55:47,645 --> 00:55:49,555
Get a signature from boss.
- Okay.

570
00:55:52,198 --> 00:55:53,177
Sir...

571
00:55:56,925 --> 00:55:57,972
Are you here?

572
00:55:58,277 --> 00:56:00,627
I have given an injection
to the crocodile.

573
00:56:01,716 --> 00:56:03,812
What can I do if it doesn't eat?

574
00:56:04,669 --> 00:56:06,700
Actually, I don't know what it eats.

575
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:09,566
I had seen it only on TV.

576
00:56:10,209 --> 00:56:12,983
Sir, after seeing it,
I'm feeling dizzy.

577
00:56:13,391 --> 00:56:15,219
Sir, please let me go.
I will live my life.

578
00:56:16,991 --> 00:56:18,149
Okay.

579
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:21,412
You can escape from the back door
without anyone's knowledge.

580
00:56:23,161 --> 00:56:23,903
Okay.

581
00:56:23,993 --> 00:56:25,889
Sir, my fees?

582
00:56:31,329 --> 00:56:32,880
He is like me.

583
00:56:35,907 --> 00:56:38,021
I showed a crocodile to you,
that settles our account.

584
00:56:40,615 --> 00:56:42,199
Neither did he give me money
nor food to eat.

585
00:56:42,544 --> 00:56:44,220
I forgot my bag.

586
00:56:45,064 --> 00:56:46,892
Oh, no, it's here.

587
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,612
Sir?

588
00:57:25,702 --> 00:57:27,602
Get signatures from the boss.
- Okay.

589
00:57:28,959 --> 00:57:30,099
What smell is this?

590
00:57:41,042 --> 00:57:44,196
You won't get an egg if you
stand quietly. You have to ask.

591
00:57:44,395 --> 00:57:47,562
You talk so loudly.

592
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:49,774
Shall I go ask him?

593
00:57:49,864 --> 00:57:52,192
No. I think sir is in a bad mood.

594
00:57:52,282 --> 00:57:53,234
Is it?

595
00:57:53,604 --> 00:57:56,615
Since I have come here, not
once have I seen him sit quietly.

596
00:57:56,984 --> 00:57:58,571
Where did that insane man keep it?

597
00:57:59,063 --> 00:57:59,842
Oh.

598
00:58:17,159 --> 00:58:19,020
I have a plan.

599
00:58:19,308 --> 00:58:21,502
They are watching,
I think they are suspicious.

600
00:58:21,616 --> 00:58:22,890
You leave.

601
00:58:23,765 --> 00:58:24,640
Oh.

602
00:58:25,582 --> 00:58:27,949
Sir, do you want a massage?

603
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:29,566
Are you out of your mind?
- Really?

604
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:32,560
Do you want a Thai massage?

605
00:58:32,792 --> 00:58:34,159
Okay, sir.

606
00:58:39,289 --> 00:58:40,925
Is this your plan?
- Yes.

607
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,104
Why? Isn't it good?

608
00:58:43,336 --> 00:58:44,655
It looks good on the paper,

609
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:46,327
because you can't see people.

610
00:58:46,534 --> 00:58:48,330
Don't worry about people...
- Can I ask you something?

611
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:49,001
What?

612
00:58:49,444 --> 00:58:50,444
Okay, ask.

613
00:58:50,999 --> 00:58:52,616
Why did you come here?

614
00:58:53,236 --> 00:58:54,666
Not to see him, of course.

615
00:58:54,756 --> 00:58:55,662
Then?

616
00:58:56,795 --> 00:58:57,740
Let it be.

617
00:58:58,029 --> 00:58:59,225
Why did you come?

618
00:59:02,037 --> 00:59:03,078
To kill you.

619
00:59:06,853 --> 00:59:08,731
If you kill me,
can you leave from here?

620
00:59:15,076 --> 00:59:17,172
Parents feed you Horlicks and
Boost in childhood,

621
00:59:17,785 --> 00:59:19,340
to enhance our memory power.

622
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:21,837
We realise the side effects,

623
00:59:22,743 --> 00:59:25,138
only when we try to forget
the girl we love.

624
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:30,063
'You have been married for
five years now.'

625
00:59:30,759 --> 00:59:33,113
'Since then I didn't shave.'

626
00:59:34,489 --> 00:59:36,303
'I missed you every day.'

627
00:59:36,935 --> 00:59:37,872
Of course,

628
00:59:38,527 --> 00:59:39,976
for all the wrong reasons.

629
00:59:41,361 --> 00:59:43,498
You became the reason
for my pain.

630
00:59:45,644 --> 00:59:47,966
I have cried in the bathroom
thinking of you.

631
00:59:49,965 --> 00:59:53,071
I thought I should get married as
you are happily married.

632
00:59:54,234 --> 00:59:55,240
But...

633
00:59:56,712 --> 00:59:58,909
Whenever I saw a girl's picture,
I compared her with you.

634
01:00:01,309 --> 01:00:03,626
Had I got married, there wouldn't
be any difference between us.

635
01:00:05,144 --> 01:00:06,602
So, I cancelled that plan,

636
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:09,002
and made this plan.

637
01:00:10,213 --> 01:00:11,358
But now,

638
01:00:11,823 --> 01:00:13,311
I feel like living my life with you.

639
01:00:13,563 --> 01:00:14,634
Ma'am,

640
01:00:15,932 --> 01:00:17,233
shall I heat water for boss,
to take a bath?

641
01:00:17,323 --> 01:00:18,959
Say, no.
- Okay.

642
01:00:26,471 --> 01:00:27,901
His massage is over.

643
01:00:32,303 --> 01:00:34,354
I am not ready to leave you again.

644
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:35,322
Hey!

645
01:00:35,412 --> 01:00:36,437
Throw it on the side.

646
01:00:36,527 --> 01:00:37,746
If you have courage...

647
01:00:37,836 --> 01:00:38,689
Hey, come here.

648
01:00:38,779 --> 01:00:41,257
There's a difference between
courage and foolishness.

649
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:42,924
Hey!

650
01:00:43,415 --> 01:00:45,613
Your work is done, leave.

651
01:00:48,465 --> 01:00:49,434
Leave.

652
01:00:53,105 --> 01:00:54,611
Okay, I will.

653
01:00:55,936 --> 01:00:56,955
Leave.

654
01:00:57,379 --> 01:00:58,409
Okay.

655
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:02,150
Leave.

656
01:01:05,001 --> 01:01:07,936
We might not get a chance to escape.

657
01:03:25,763 --> 01:03:27,760
Let's see the difference between
courage and foolishness.

658
01:03:30,251 --> 01:03:30,975
Hey!

659
01:03:49,716 --> 01:03:50,665
Look there.

660
01:03:57,615 --> 01:03:59,364
You go there.
- Come here.

661
01:07:20,771 --> 01:07:22,544
The hunt starts now.

662
01:07:22,774 --> 01:07:24,293
We will find you.

663
01:07:24,383 --> 01:07:25,963
The hunt starts now.

664
01:07:26,053 --> 01:07:27,515
We will find you.

665
01:07:27,658 --> 01:07:29,066
The hunt starts now.

666
01:07:29,288 --> 01:07:30,589
We will find you.

667
01:07:30,751 --> 01:07:32,445
The hunt starts now.

668
01:07:32,597 --> 01:07:34,822
We will find you.

669
01:08:07,099 --> 01:08:09,535
According to the map,
the main road must be nearby.

670
01:08:09,822 --> 01:08:10,911
I can't see it.

671
01:08:11,059 --> 01:08:12,873
It also said the estate
is four hundredacres.

672
01:08:13,011 --> 01:08:13,883
What?

673
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:15,148
Come.

674
01:08:16,306 --> 01:08:18,785
An astrologer predicted that
I will become an artist,

675
01:08:18,946 --> 01:08:20,672
but I didn't know
I will become an escape artist.

676
01:08:21,770 --> 01:08:22,587
Oh.

677
01:08:23,081 --> 01:08:25,107
Had I known...
- What would you have done?

678
01:08:25,749 --> 01:08:26,949
I would have worn sports shoes.

679
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:28,052
Oh.

680
01:08:28,223 --> 01:08:29,151
Hey.

681
01:08:42,894 --> 01:08:43,839
That way!

682
01:11:00,605 --> 01:11:02,111
Wild boar.
- Hey, come on.

683
01:11:15,375 --> 01:11:16,889
Oh.

684
01:11:20,304 --> 01:11:21,393
Hey.

685
01:11:24,241 --> 01:11:25,335
Do you know how to drive it?

686
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:28,385
I eloped with you,
it's not a big deal for me.

687
01:11:30,910 --> 01:11:31,995
Are you sure?

688
01:11:45,208 --> 01:11:46,258
There's no key.

689
01:11:46,956 --> 01:11:48,110
You know the house, don't you?

690
01:11:48,312 --> 01:11:49,132
Joke.

691
01:11:50,967 --> 01:11:51,919
One minute.

692
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,109
Okay, drive.

693
01:12:36,988 --> 01:12:39,365
"There's no end to the rainbow."

694
01:12:39,544 --> 01:12:41,806
"There's no end to desires."

695
01:12:42,048 --> 01:12:42,846
"Why..."

696
01:12:43,003 --> 01:12:45,094
Listen, we are eloping
for the first time.

697
01:12:45,353 --> 01:12:46,276
How do you feel?

698
01:12:46,844 --> 01:12:48,533
I think we can drive faster.

699
01:12:48,736 --> 01:12:51,058
There's no urgency.
Five minutes more.

700
01:12:51,376 --> 01:12:54,081
Then it will be you, me,
and this tractor.

701
01:12:54,363 --> 01:12:58,366
We will tell the story of this tractor
to our children. It will be fun.

702
01:12:58,855 --> 01:13:00,992
You idiot.
- I remembered something,

703
01:13:01,653 --> 01:13:02,668
have you thought about their names?

704
01:13:04,219 --> 01:13:06,167
There's no urgency,

705
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:08,617
We can think about it
while escaping from here.

706
01:13:09,383 --> 01:13:11,648
Most importantly,
will you marry me?

707
01:13:11,932 --> 01:13:13,324
Will you shut up!

708
01:13:13,516 --> 01:13:14,860
Tell me the truth,

709
01:13:15,019 --> 01:13:17,090
I imagine things very fast.

710
01:13:17,265 --> 01:13:19,354
You smiled at me when
I had come for admissions.

711
01:13:19,638 --> 01:13:22,300
I got bowled over on seeing you.

712
01:13:24,754 --> 01:13:25,924
Why are you talking about it now?

713
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:28,299
We have to think about the future.

714
01:13:28,823 --> 01:13:30,821
Forget it. Will you marry me?

715
01:13:30,993 --> 01:13:31,850
What?

716
01:13:32,344 --> 01:13:33,674
Let's see.

717
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:36,947
What? You silly girl...
- Okay, I will marry you.

718
01:13:37,194 --> 01:13:38,295
Move aside.

719
01:13:38,867 --> 01:13:40,739
That's the quality of a good girl.

720
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:44,006
"The horses of desires..."
Nice song.

721
01:13:44,865 --> 01:13:45,977
There's a problem.

722
01:13:46,301 --> 01:13:48,419
What is it?
- I live in a single bedroom house.

723
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:50,813
I have a single cot.

724
01:13:52,106 --> 01:13:54,026
Don't worry,
I will sleep on the ground.

725
01:13:56,009 --> 01:13:58,102
Why should I sleep on the ground
after marrying you?

726
01:13:58,741 --> 01:14:00,118
There's one more problem.

727
01:14:00,705 --> 01:14:01,414
What is it?

728
01:14:01,598 --> 01:14:03,001
My friend also lives with me.

729
01:14:03,303 --> 01:14:04,396
I can't ask him to leave.

730
01:14:05,353 --> 01:14:07,517
Because I brought his bike here.

731
01:14:08,263 --> 01:14:09,197
Oh.

732
01:14:09,481 --> 01:14:10,563
What can I do?

733
01:14:10,744 --> 01:14:12,875
Let's do this, we will gift
this tractor to him.

734
01:14:13,107 --> 01:14:14,255
He will be happy.

735
01:14:14,414 --> 01:14:15,920
Think about what happened with us.

736
01:14:16,146 --> 01:14:18,152
You shouldn't think about the past.

737
01:14:18,242 --> 01:14:20,177
You should move ahead
happily in life.

738
01:14:27,476 --> 01:14:29,835
Don't turn behind, drive.
- Where are you going?

739
01:15:48,285 --> 01:15:49,240
Where did he go?

740
01:15:53,098 --> 01:15:54,846
Sir, I have a doubt.
- What is it?

741
01:15:55,495 --> 01:15:57,346
I heard Tiger Ponnappa's son
is still alive.

742
01:15:57,748 --> 01:15:58,611
Is it true?

743
01:15:59,539 --> 01:16:01,602
This is a secret.
How did you know?

744
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:02,549
I know.

745
01:16:02,753 --> 01:16:03,731
Even I know.
- Yes.

746
01:16:03,879 --> 01:16:05,330
Does everyone know about it?

747
01:16:05,714 --> 01:16:07,143
I'll tell you in detail, listen.

748
01:16:07,516 --> 01:16:11,087
We have to kill his family members
and bury them here.

749
01:16:11,644 --> 01:16:13,172
Tiger son's dead body is missing.

750
01:16:13,519 --> 01:16:15,314
We all were scared.

751
01:16:15,583 --> 01:16:17,064
We didn't find him.

752
01:16:17,223 --> 01:16:18,815
He was a fourteen years old boy.

753
01:16:19,062 --> 01:16:20,247
We had almost thrashed him to death.

754
01:16:21,185 --> 01:16:22,090
Missing.

755
01:16:22,293 --> 01:16:23,189
Then?

756
01:16:23,529 --> 01:16:26,118
We buried all of them and went home.

757
01:16:26,941 --> 01:16:28,274
Didn't, sir, say anything?

758
01:16:28,485 --> 01:16:30,187
We did not say anything to sir.

759
01:16:30,590 --> 01:16:33,773
If anyone of you is planning
to tell him we will kill them.

760
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:37,427
Are you alive?

761
01:16:40,571 --> 01:16:41,176
Oh.

762
01:16:41,302 --> 01:16:42,626
Lord Shiva.

763
01:16:43,361 --> 01:16:44,916
I hurt my back.

764
01:16:52,556 --> 01:16:54,484
I had so many plans
on how to use this tractor.

765
01:16:54,574 --> 01:16:55,278
Oh, no.

766
01:16:55,368 --> 01:16:57,826
Come here. Are you okay?
- What?

767
01:17:03,186 --> 01:17:04,824
Who is this man?

768
01:17:05,675 --> 01:17:07,659
Come on, run.

769
01:17:07,982 --> 01:17:10,295
Come on!

770
01:17:48,338 --> 01:17:49,269
Come.

771
01:17:54,091 --> 01:17:55,054
They left.

772
01:17:55,890 --> 01:17:56,830
Come.

773
01:17:57,857 --> 01:17:58,659
Oh, no!

774
01:20:44,681 --> 01:20:45,784
Give me the bomb.

775
01:20:46,605 --> 01:20:47,939
He's asking for the bomb.

776
01:20:48,332 --> 01:20:49,605
He took it.

777
01:20:50,607 --> 01:20:51,881
You?

778
01:20:57,167 --> 01:20:58,108
He took it.

779
01:21:00,799 --> 01:21:01,856
Come here.

780
01:23:45,148 --> 01:23:45,936
Come.

781
01:23:46,026 --> 01:23:46,957
I can't.

782
01:23:47,068 --> 01:23:49,099
A little ahead.
- I can't run.

783
01:23:50,051 --> 01:23:51,741
They are following us. Come on.

784
01:24:06,853 --> 01:24:08,071
Don't move.

785
01:24:11,556 --> 01:24:12,978
Be careful.

786
01:24:18,614 --> 01:24:19,518
Hello.

787
01:24:21,741 --> 01:24:22,601
You?

788
01:24:26,578 --> 01:24:29,151
Oh, doctor, what are you doing
on the tree with the drip bottle?

789
01:24:29,406 --> 01:24:31,573
Sir, what do I do? They didn't
even give me food to eat.

790
01:24:31,721 --> 01:24:33,319
What are you doing here?

791
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:36,758
I was trying to escape.
- Okay.

792
01:24:36,848 --> 01:24:38,001
I found a map.

793
01:24:39,096 --> 01:24:41,444
Look, if you had faith
like the doctor has,

794
01:24:41,614 --> 01:24:43,497
we would have been home by now.

795
01:24:44,128 --> 01:24:45,210
Let it be.

796
01:24:46,163 --> 01:24:48,009
Doctor, where are we?

797
01:24:48,156 --> 01:24:49,205
On a tree.

798
01:24:49,722 --> 01:24:52,056
No doctor, according to the map,
where are we now?

799
01:24:52,407 --> 01:24:54,578
If it worked, I wouldn't have
been in this situation.

800
01:24:54,763 --> 01:24:55,643
You're right.

801
01:24:55,733 --> 01:24:56,931
Why are you holding it?

802
01:24:57,134 --> 01:24:58,246
This?

803
01:25:02,663 --> 01:25:03,638
Oh...

804
01:25:06,214 --> 01:25:07,306
I will get you trapped.

805
01:25:08,429 --> 01:25:09,278
Hey...

806
01:25:09,997 --> 01:25:10,854
Hey!

807
01:25:13,948 --> 01:25:14,830
Hey!

808
01:25:56,776 --> 01:25:57,942
Oh, no.

809
01:26:12,953 --> 01:26:13,775
Hey...

810
01:26:25,921 --> 01:26:27,158
The estate is good.

811
01:26:48,863 --> 01:26:49,643
Come.

812
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:20,804
No, let us go. Please.

813
01:27:21,291 --> 01:27:22,480
Please.

814
01:28:25,218 --> 01:28:26,243
Please.

815
01:28:37,048 --> 01:28:38,069
No!

816
01:28:41,013 --> 01:28:42,235
He didn't kill him,

817
01:28:43,175 --> 01:28:44,416
I did.

818
01:28:55,771 --> 01:28:57,900
Sir, it is not her fault.

819
01:28:58,033 --> 01:29:00,138
Sir, let us go.
I love her very much.

820
01:29:00,337 --> 01:29:02,527
Sir, please let us go.

821
01:29:02,770 --> 01:29:04,506
I will become your servant.

822
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:07,496
Please sir, let her go.

823
01:29:07,703 --> 01:29:09,450
Sir, please let us go.

824
01:29:15,256 --> 01:29:18,223
Run to her, I will let you go.

825
01:29:18,657 --> 01:29:19,760
Go.

826
01:30:43,064 --> 01:30:44,554
Sir, you said you would leave us.

827
01:30:57,819 --> 01:30:59,531
Pilaf...

828
01:31:09,649 --> 01:31:12,044
Shall we kill and bury them here?

829
01:31:12,501 --> 01:31:15,452
We could have killed them there,
why did we get them here?

830
01:31:15,862 --> 01:31:17,381
What do we do?

831
01:31:18,789 --> 01:31:20,326
I am thinking.

832
01:31:21,110 --> 01:31:24,023
Do you know what will happen if
people learn that boss died?

833
01:31:24,474 --> 01:31:27,737
When people come here,
We will decide what to do.

834
01:31:37,624 --> 01:31:38,986
I think they are here.

835
01:31:39,851 --> 01:31:40,901
Go get them.

836
01:32:17,895 --> 01:32:18,905
Here.

837
01:32:20,092 --> 01:32:21,398
Sir, here.

838
01:32:21,822 --> 01:32:23,036
I heard it.

839
01:32:30,851 --> 01:32:31,825
Here?

840
01:32:32,868 --> 01:32:34,862
We killed Tiger's family.

841
01:32:35,827 --> 01:32:37,271
Something is missing.

842
01:32:56,941 --> 01:32:59,784
'Ravana composed
the Shiva Thandava hymn.'

843
01:33:01,165 --> 01:33:05,476
'He played lute using his throat
and sang praises of Lord Shiva.'

844
01:33:06,044 --> 01:33:08,739
'I will play his throat as a flute.'

845
01:33:12,135 --> 01:33:13,095
I am not scared.

846
01:33:14,226 --> 01:33:16,188
Before killing a person,

847
01:33:16,971 --> 01:33:18,149
create fear in them.

848
01:33:26,042 --> 01:33:27,143
Goodbye.

849
01:33:36,081 --> 01:33:38,970
'I tied one of his legs to the jeep
and the other to a tree.'

850
01:33:39,358 --> 01:33:41,098
'I will drive away the jeep.'

851
01:33:45,013 --> 01:33:46,729
'I have a doubt.'

852
01:34:22,074 --> 01:34:23,458
He is here..

853
01:34:32,926 --> 01:34:34,203
Let's go.

854
01:34:34,739 --> 01:34:37,010
You will die by my hands.

855
01:35:15,387 --> 01:35:16,232
Hey.

856
01:35:17,562 --> 01:35:18,599
One moment.

857
01:35:23,108 --> 01:35:24,101
Take this.

858
01:35:31,683 --> 01:35:32,767
Remove your goggles.

859
01:36:26,821 --> 01:36:27,464
Oh.

860
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:05,709
What happened?
- He...

861
01:38:19,774 --> 01:38:22,150
Come, let's go.

862
01:38:23,201 --> 01:38:25,093
No, I can't.

863
01:38:35,805 --> 01:38:36,905
You can.

864
01:39:35,594 --> 01:39:36,471
Come on.

865
01:39:36,944 --> 01:39:38,875
I am feeling cold. Please.

866
01:39:39,525 --> 01:39:40,334
Okay.

867
01:39:48,150 --> 01:39:49,216
It is working.

868
01:39:50,093 --> 01:39:51,293
Are you done?
- No.

869
01:39:51,625 --> 01:39:52,594
There's some left.

870
01:40:04,223 --> 01:40:05,175
Oh!

871
01:40:07,819 --> 01:40:08,990
What say?

872
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:12,992
Are you ready?
- Yes.

873
01:40:13,488 --> 01:40:14,909
Doctor, will you come along?

874
01:40:15,385 --> 01:40:16,902
No, sir, I will eat and then come.

875
01:40:16,992 --> 01:40:17,986
Okay. No problem.

876
01:40:18,076 --> 01:40:19,048
Are you ready?

877
01:40:19,495 --> 01:40:20,359
Let's go.

878
01:40:20,913 --> 01:40:22,404
We are leaving.

879
01:40:27,245 --> 01:40:28,766
Oh, staircase.

880
01:40:30,314 --> 01:40:32,331
It looks dangerous.

881
01:40:36,191 --> 01:40:37,871
It looks very deep.

882
01:40:38,022 --> 01:40:39,104
Be careful.

883
01:40:39,355 --> 01:40:40,330
Okay?

884
01:40:43,384 --> 01:40:44,160
Careful.

885
01:40:45,102 --> 01:40:46,121
Hey...

886
01:40:47,314 --> 01:40:49,397
We might find water soon.

887
01:40:50,492 --> 01:40:52,047
Oh, bed.

888
01:40:53,576 --> 01:40:56,165
The door is closed.

889
01:40:56,944 --> 01:40:58,159
We will go from the front door.

890
01:40:58,295 --> 01:41:00,304
Everyone is there.
- They are our people.

891
01:41:00,872 --> 01:41:01,610
Come on.

892
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:03,183
I will talk to them.

893
01:41:03,991 --> 01:41:06,420
I have to talk to them.

894
01:41:13,727 --> 01:41:15,574
Hey, did you recognise me?
- Come on.

895
01:41:15,809 --> 01:41:18,399
In the car, you thrashed me.

896
01:41:18,765 --> 01:41:20,237
Do you remember?

897
01:41:44,018 --> 01:41:45,709
I fell.

898
01:41:53,178 --> 01:41:55,454
Even you fell down?
Slowly man.

899
01:41:55,690 --> 01:41:59,595
Massage on the top.
Yes, it is excellent.

900
01:42:00,486 --> 01:42:02,738
Thank you, I feel good.

901
01:42:04,553 --> 01:42:05,971
Thanks.

902
01:42:33,983 --> 01:42:35,596
It is a radio.

903
01:42:37,029 --> 01:42:38,291
It is a radio.

904
01:44:02,948 --> 01:44:03,835
Who do you think you are?

905
01:44:06,612 --> 01:44:07,879
How dare you hit my girl?

906
01:44:08,175 --> 01:44:09,079
You!

907
01:44:09,351 --> 01:44:11,702
'Listeners, based on your requests,'

908
01:44:11,792 --> 01:44:15,125
'we are playing "Nenapina Hudugiye"
song from the movie 'Hero'.'

909
01:44:15,379 --> 01:44:16,842
'Lyricist, Yogaraj Bhat,'

910
01:44:17,109 --> 01:44:18,812
'music, Girish Gupta.'

911
01:44:19,089 --> 01:44:20,875
'Listen to it and enjoy.'

912
01:46:36,461 --> 01:46:37,603
You're here.

913
01:46:37,736 --> 01:46:39,803
Come on, let's dance.

914
01:46:40,235 --> 01:46:41,328
Hurry up.

915
01:46:41,628 --> 01:46:43,422
Excuse me, do you have pickle?

916
01:46:43,555 --> 01:46:45,206
Yes, sir.

917
01:46:45,387 --> 01:46:47,111
Really? Oh!

918
01:46:47,351 --> 01:46:50,046
You need a drink too.

919
01:46:50,465 --> 01:46:51,717
Here you go.

920
01:46:51,883 --> 01:46:53,212
You!

921
01:46:53,939 --> 01:46:56,298
It will hurt you.
The doctor told me.

922
01:46:56,409 --> 01:46:57,754
Come.
- There are no side effects.

923
01:46:57,844 --> 01:46:59,924
Wait, the chef is getting pickle.

924
01:47:00,256 --> 01:47:01,116
Shut up and come with me.

925
01:47:01,234 --> 01:47:02,737
Why did you say?

926
01:47:13,026 --> 01:47:14,262
Do you want to meet, sir?

927
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:16,555
He is in the bathroom upstairs.

928
01:47:17,191 --> 01:47:20,006
Eat before you leave.
I'm making pilaf.

929
01:47:54,016 --> 01:47:55,086
It is good.

930
01:47:55,990 --> 01:47:57,452
Get up.
- What is it?

931
01:47:58,884 --> 01:48:00,579
Where? Why?
- Get up.

932
01:48:08,894 --> 01:48:10,559
Sir...

933
01:48:10,892 --> 01:48:12,246
Sir, come here.
- Which way?

934
01:48:12,382 --> 01:48:13,915
This way, sir.

935
01:48:14,715 --> 01:48:16,657
Smell me and come to me.

936
01:48:17,721 --> 01:48:18,777
Sir, where are you?

937
01:48:19,046 --> 01:48:20,463
Sir, this way.
- Which way?

938
01:48:20,644 --> 01:48:21,383
Sir?

939
01:48:24,217 --> 01:48:25,809
He broke my nose.

940
01:48:27,382 --> 01:48:28,424
Oh, no.

941
01:48:28,514 --> 01:48:30,029
The poor doctor.

942
01:48:31,053 --> 01:48:33,232
Doctor, you have bandage, don't you?
Apply it.

943
01:48:34,658 --> 01:48:35,906
Cheers.

944
01:48:46,139 --> 01:48:47,126
What say?

945
01:48:54,254 --> 01:48:55,975
Hey, did you put liquor in it?

946
01:48:56,238 --> 01:48:57,595
Did you empty the bottle?

947
01:49:00,416 --> 01:49:01,328
You slapped her?

948
01:49:01,479 --> 01:49:02,251
Hey!

949
01:49:03,314 --> 01:49:04,978
You!

950
01:49:16,570 --> 01:49:18,609
Doctor, did you see
how I punched him?

951
01:49:18,699 --> 01:49:20,798
Superb, sir.

952
01:49:20,945 --> 01:49:21,832
Right.

953
01:49:25,807 --> 01:49:28,624
Did you see the cap?

954
01:49:30,422 --> 01:49:32,065
Where did it go?

955
01:49:32,624 --> 01:49:34,186
Did I drop it?

956
01:49:39,361 --> 01:49:42,548
The bottle is empty,
why should I close it?

957
01:49:45,297 --> 01:49:46,453
Oh, no.

958
01:49:47,070 --> 01:49:49,163
Don't kill me!

959
01:49:50,265 --> 01:49:52,601
Sir, why?

960
01:52:21,784 --> 01:52:22,644
Who are you?

961
01:52:22,810 --> 01:52:24,908
Tiger Ponnappa's son.
- Tiger Ponnappa?

962
01:52:25,517 --> 01:52:27,023
Did you forget it so soon?

963
01:52:27,691 --> 01:52:31,147
You killed my entire family
in the same house years ago.

964
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,452
I will not spare anyone.

965
01:52:34,736 --> 01:52:35,604
I will...

966
01:53:14,417 --> 01:53:15,400
Look here.

967
01:53:15,839 --> 01:53:17,012
Don't get scared.

968
01:53:18,036 --> 01:53:18,931
Come.

969
01:53:25,690 --> 01:53:27,024
Leave me alone.

970
01:53:28,812 --> 01:53:29,840
Doctor.
- Yes.

971
01:53:29,930 --> 01:53:30,856
Come on, let's go.

972
01:53:30,999 --> 01:53:32,024
Did the fight get over?

973
01:53:46,095 --> 01:53:48,045
Slowly.

974
01:53:51,224 --> 01:53:52,768
Are you leaving?

975
01:53:53,023 --> 01:53:54,392
Yes, chef. Everything is finished.

976
01:53:54,803 --> 01:53:56,420
The pilaf is ready,
eat and leave.

977
01:53:56,641 --> 01:53:57,708
No.

978
01:53:58,373 --> 01:54:00,319
My stomach is full.
I'll come some other time.

979
01:54:01,131 --> 01:54:01,925
Okay.

980
01:54:02,146 --> 01:54:03,837
So, I have to eat food alone today.

981
01:54:05,758 --> 01:54:07,032
I will join you.

982
01:55:16,765 --> 01:55:17,936
Doctor.
- Yes.

983
01:55:18,242 --> 01:55:19,730
Your injection is working.

984
01:55:19,932 --> 01:55:21,045
Is it?

985
01:55:37,741 --> 01:55:39,160
Can you drive?

986
01:55:43,771 --> 01:55:44,638
Yes.

987
01:55:47,085 --> 01:55:48,059
What say?
