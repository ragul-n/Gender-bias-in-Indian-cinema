00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,885
If you watch me,
you'll fail in yourplan.

262
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,920
I won't bend easily,
who mollified by someone.

263
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,790
See... He's talking
about mollifying.

264
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,492
He is not a good
man. Go out...

265
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,761
I... - Wait, bodyguard.

266
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:12,564
What are you doing? Is this
themanner to a stranger?

267
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,054
Is this the
wayto behave?

268
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,269
You go inside.
- I'm Jai Krishnan...

269
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:19,737
I'll correct everything.
I'll speak with her.

270
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,446
Good...

271
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:31,780
A honor is thereto
work as his bodyguard.

272
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:40,416
Lord Krishnan in the
middle ofthegirls.

273
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,995
Very dangerous.

274
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,464
She's arrogant
becauseofthis.

275
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:49,201
She had mollified him
sitting closely.

276
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,668
Hey...

277
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,539
What did you say?

278
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:54,773
Did I mollifyhim?

279
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:55,974
What is it to
you forthat?

280
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,310
What is it to me?

281
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,145
Why havel come
here, then?

282
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:04,249
This bodyguard's dutyis
not only saving his life.

283
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,786
I have theresponsibilityto
maintain his pride also.

284
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,354
Who said that his
pride has gone?

285
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,623
Then... Arepeople
speaking unnecessarily?

286
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,025
Whatpeoplearesaying?

287
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:18,861
Nothing. They are talking
thathe is weak in girls.

288
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:23,795
They are seeing onlythis. Then
how could I remain silently?

289
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:30,075
Not only men becomehis enemies.
Ladies also can become his enemies.

290
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:37,182
So that, I won'tallow you
or any girls before him.

291
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:42,381
Are you saying this even I
treat him likemy father?

292
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:48,060
You maythink like that. Perhaps he
may think you as his daughter.

293
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,296
But peopleare
sayingwrongly.

294
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,600
That's why I'm telling. If you're
careful, it's goodto you.

295
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,091
It's good to Ashokan
brother& metoo.

296
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:03,475
This girl is not
a bad girl.

297
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,568
But Ashokan brother...

298
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:09,145
Maybepeople
think like that.

299
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,593
Ashokan brother! I
did it unknowingly.

300
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:22,561
Forgiveme.

301
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:27,399
I'vesurrendered bars because
you hadworkedwith me.

302
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,602
But now, I don't think
it's not necessary.

303
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:33,172
Ashokan brother! It
won't happen again.

304
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,974
No. You forget
this business.

305
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,777
I'vecalled Rajeev forthis
business from Dubai.

306
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,646
He'll maintain
everything hereafter.

307
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:43,148
Shanmugam brother! Didn't I
tell you not to do that?

308
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,249
Now it's over.

309
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:47,753
It's not over. But
I'll make it over.

310
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,687
I'll kill him along
with his family.

311
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,027
Hello... - Hey!
Who is that?

312
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,663
Here... - Is this you?

313
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,898
It's me. - Ashokan brother
will decidethat.

314
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:04,436
Then, you should givethis letter
to him beforel meet him.

315
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:07,606
You give this appointment
to him in person.

316
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,675
Now you go & come
in theevening.

317
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,472
At that time, Ashokan
brother will come here.

318
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,086
Is this that girl?

319
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,452
When did she
enter here?

320
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,235
What's your business here?

321
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,004
I've come here because
madam called mehere.

322
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,173
Ashokan brother is coming.
Right? That's why.

323
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,809
If Ashokan brother comes, what's up
to you? Won't you understand me?

324
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:46,178
I camehere to
help for cooking.

325
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,946
Don't watch me in
this view, okay?

326
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:50,582
No. I'll fit someother
eyes to watch you.

327
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:56,088
I don't understandwhy Ashokan brother's
wife also accompany to spoil his name.

328
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,956
Don't talk unnecessarily.

329
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,925
Whoever maytakebirth in
this family, they aregreat.

330
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,729
Why that? Won't children takebirth here?
Will elders only takebirth here?

331
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:06,665
Don't tryto cover theinner shame
bytalking abouttheir pride.

332
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,968
Lfitis a shameful family, why did
you comeas abody guard here?

333
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:14,506
That's Ashokan brother's power. We
can win anybodywith this power.

334
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:18,670
Can you win thecountrywith power?
You can win onlythe jungle.

335
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:21,280
What?

336
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,114
We'd not dominate people with power.
We'd melt them with affection.

337
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:30,222
Likethat, you don'ttry to bring
someone under your control.

338
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:33,725
Anyway, you've come here.
You stay alongwith madam.

339
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:36,695
Then, no onewon't
seeus talking.

340
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:39,687
That's enough to send
you out. Go... I'll go.

341
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,878
You said that Rajeevan

Therewas a meeting in town.

00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,853
Whereis Ammu?
Has she slept?

00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:05,624

She's waiting for her dad.

347
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:06,818
Ammu...

348
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,697

359
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:37,723
He came heretaking someone's
letter as you got amurderthreat.

360
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:40,459
That's why, Menon had allowed
him to stayin the guest house.

361
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,260
Now she is also
teasing him.

362
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,762
What's this?

363
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:47,532
If someonecomes, will you
allow him here to stay?

364
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,900
Idiots...

365
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,037
After thedawn,

366
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,470

367
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:57,238

But you don'tsend him.

369
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:03,615
It's good for my dad ifsuch
aman stays with him.

370
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,549
I'll compromisehim. Okay?

371
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,654
Dad is saying send him. But
daughtersays not to send him.

372
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,554
Whom should I obey
amongthem?

373
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:17,729
Whylate? Ashokan brother has
already come. Now he's sleeping.

374
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,766
Oh! I was in aplan to

376
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,470
Certainlynot. I didn't
even enter his room.

377
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,638
Very good.

378
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:30,642
You go & sleep. Don't forget to lock your
room before you sleep, okay?

379
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,344
Lt'll take somemore time
to sleep. -Whyis that?

380
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:35,180
Ashokan brother's son is
coming from Dubai.

381
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,983
Oh! God. Is he
also coming?

382
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,245
What?

383
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:44,256
Heis weak in girls
more than his dad.

384
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,223

385
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:48,556

He is not supposeto give
them money. Cheap fellow.

389
00:23:55,801 --> 00:24:01,106
When hewent to Pune for studying,
he caught a Nepali girl.

390
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:04,776
Ashokan brother had senthim
to Dubai bythat problem.

391
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,813
How do you
know all these?

392
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:10,215
I won't comehere
without knowing anything.

393
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:13,651
I've collected all
their histories.

394
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,254

You lock theroom & sleep
saying this reason.

398
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,485
Whoever mayknock thedoor,
don't open. Okay?

399
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,570
Hey...

400
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,972
There is no any dog. But I'm
hearing barking sound.

401
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,540
Here. - Where? - Comehere.

402
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,943
Why are you hiding?

403

Which governmenthas sent you
here, Pakistan government?

404
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,683
I got scolding because of
allowing you to stayhere.

405
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,418
No government
sent me here.

406
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:47,819
Vaariyar sir only
sent me here.

407
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,323
Vaariyar sir! Then... Why didn't
you tell me this already?

408
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,024
I didn't get any
gap to tell that.

409
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:56,228
Gap! Heordered me
to chase you out.

410
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,763
But Ammu refused it. You go
& come in themorning.

411
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:02,100
If Ashokan brother goes
out beforel comehere?

00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,535

You need notstay, just sleep.
Takethemat & sleep.

415
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,179

I asked you Ex-service.

424
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:49,814
You mean that? I don't
feel that he has service.

425
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:54,553
Then, I've told him complete
details of you & Ashokan brother.

00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:58,323
Heis therein
the path oftruth.

He wantedto join with you.
This is his parents goodness.

519
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:14,672
I know that you
won't need his help.

520
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:17,742
But ifyou do this,
it'd beahelp to me.

521
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:23,009
Becauseit is for a family that taught
education to many children.

But you're the reason

Leave from herebefore
Ashokan brother sees you.

583
00:38:58,369 --> 00:38:59,904
Or your death is sure.

584

587
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:18,849
You need not worry.

588
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:22,360
Heis the reason
for everything.

589
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,295
I'vechased him.

590
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:30,723
Why did you do so? Lfhe was not

591
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:43,080
Vaariyar sir didn'tsend him
here. God only sent here.

592
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,707
In the place of Vaariyar sir.

593
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:51,856
Do you know whose
team is that?

594
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,255
Shanmugam brother's men.

595
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:06,570
Tell me, you bastard.

596
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,839
Whereis your
Shanmugam? Tell him.

597
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,810
He had goneto Malaysia with his family
hearing that you'veescaped.

598
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,300
Comehere.

599
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:20,584
I think hewon't
comeback here.

600
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,985
Lfhedoesn't come, he
may livethereso long.

601
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:28,116
You call & tell
this to him.

602
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,219
Ashokan brother!

603
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,098
Be careful.

604
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:39,036
Heknows that hecan't return
back, when you arealive.

605
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:44,804
He'll attemptto kill you &
your family from there.

606
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,627
Is this Sethu?

607
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:15,739
Menon brother! Your daughter

608
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:19,743

Hey! You take Ammu & leave

He'll make everyoneas white.

625
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,781
Even his complexion is white,
his heart is black.

626
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:09,020
Don't stare, arrange
theluggage.

00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:15,830
Who will takethis?

628
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,149

Their collegeis reopened.

632
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:45,496
Just do what I say.

633
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:48,232
Ammu! You don't
go out from here.

634
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:51,030
Hereafter you study
from thehouse.

635
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:56,697
I won't agree. I have
to go to college.

636
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:00,611
Don'tshout. What your
dad is saying right.

637
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:04,148
He ordered not
only you, him also.

00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,516
Then, why don't
you understand?

639
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:07,117
My thing is not

640
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:08,919
Only onemore yearto
finish my study, right?

641
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,654
What will you die?

642
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:14,613
You're going to London after
themarriage. Then, you studythere.

643
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,963
This year, you study & write your
exam from here as yourdad says.

644
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:20,664
Whyis this one year?

645
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:21,932
I'll stayhere
for my lifetime.

646
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,534
I don't wantmarriage &
don't want to go to London.

647
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:26,970
I can't answer you.
You ask yourdad.

648
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:30,832
Brother! Please, I have
to go to college.

649
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:36,647
My friends, teachers
& campus... What alife?

00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:40,117
Only onemore year...
But you'reall...

651
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,209
Ammu...

652
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:46,657
Ammu kutty! Why are
you crying likethis?

653
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:48,592
You understand our
dad's situation also.

654
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:53,831
He was scared, when they
tried to attack you & mom.

655
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,867
He's afraidthatwe
go out from here.

656
00:43:56,867 --> 00:44:00,270
Then, how it possible? How could
hesend you to thecollege?

657
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,640
You'rehavingthese
men's influence.

658
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,775
Dad is having his
men everywhere.

659
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:08,677
Still couldn't you make
any protection for me?

660
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:14,652
Protection! Does shewantto go
collegeunder police protection?

661
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,554
This is enough to
spoil our name.

662
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:19,056
Our pridewill bespoiled
even ifwedo like this.

663
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:23,288
Peoplewill tell that you don't allow your
daughter fearing for Shanmugam.

664
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:27,131
Policeprotection is
useless in thecollege.

665
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:29,622
So, shall we send
ourJai Krishnan?

666
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:31,735

Okay, you may go.

688
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:47,211
Wait. That's college.

689
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:50,481
It's not in our control. You
don'tshow your play there.

690
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:54,284
No, madam. I'll belikea
shadow ofAmmu hereafter.

691

692
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:10,160
Greets...

693
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:14,938
Is this garland? I thought
it's a flower entrance.

694
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,340
What is this, man?

695
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,568
Whatis this?

696
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:22,913
It's enough if
you givearose.

697
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:24,574
That's a buckeye
for my size.

698
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:31,880
Who is this new face?

699
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:45,096
Oh! God... Has
shegone?

700
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:51,869
Whatis this?

701
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,425
Who is this,
Gemini Ganesan?

702
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,532
Didn'tl say? What
is this disguise?

703
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:17,034
See, everyone is

Letthem watch. This is the
bodyguard's disguise.

705

706
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:25,876
Why? You'realso a student here, isn'tit?
Just comecasually as a friend.

707
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:29,471
Bodyguard is not friend. Friend
also neverbecomes abodyguard.

708
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:34,318
Do you remember

709
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,653
Her marriage
proposal was fixed.

710
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:41,792
If anyone follows her saying love
or anything, I'll reprimand you only.

711
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:43,627
No, madam. It won't
happen like that.

712
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:44,962

717
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:07,484
Sir! I... - No.

718
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:09,179
No more excuses.

719

I heard that you were a
genius in your old college.

720
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:17,553
I'veadmitted you herebecause
your mark list was good.

721
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:22,588
If you had written exams on those
days, you'd havegot the rank.

722
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:30,863
Is youraim wantto bea
thug avoiding your studies?

723
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:35,379
You'vethechangeto

724
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:37,547
God! Why is he
blabbering all these?

725
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:40,951
I don't chase you outbecause
ofthat reason. 'Understand'?

726
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:42,052
Okay.

727
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:46,819
Don't behavelikethis
hereafter & studywell.

728
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:49,554
You may go. - Come.

Jai Krishna! What's this?
Move away from here.

734
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:26,353
Oh! God...

00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,740
I said you

736
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:45,142
Why is that? You've
any sick in yourback.

737
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:53,853
Bodyguards never sit.

738
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:57,353
Why?

739
00:49:58,295 --> 00:49:59,463
What's your name?

740
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:00,521
Jai Krishnan.

741
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:40,393
You've forgotten everything
after your vacation.

742
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,837
Then... why are you
coming here?

743
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,246
You'restanding like you
swallowed something.

744
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:50,975
If you don't
know, just say.

745
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,193
Did anyoneask you?

746
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:06,629
What is the necessity forAmmu to tell?
Somehow you gotanswer. Okay?

747
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,319
We're all Ammu
friends only.

748
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:32,689
You don'tstand stiffly
& go away from here.

749
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:34,858
Let us breathe, please.

750
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:38,995
Am I standing in your nose
to stop your breathe?

751
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:40,826

That's why, I told you to make
friendship with Jai Krishnan.

757
00:51:58,048 --> 00:52:01,017

00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:08,592
What is the solution to move
awayhim from Ammu, then?

760
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:10,293
Shall wegivetablets for
his stomach upset?

761
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:13,296
Best. His father is
also likehim.

762
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:16,026
Whoever say disease forthem,
he'll give tablet for stomach upset.

763
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:22,405
This bodyguard treatment... We
arenot. Girls! You should do.

764
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:27,477
Anyoneof you call him
frequently over phone.

765
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:28,545
Whyis that?

766
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:31,639
In thatlineonly,
we can control him.

767
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:35,185
Ramla! You're
fit forthat.

768
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:36,953
You'recapable
forthat.

769
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:38,889
Go, man. I can't do this.

770
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:43,724
Then Ammu, you givehis numberto me.

We'll get someone.

772
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:54,070
I can't bear aperson to
roam around mealways.

773

777
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,483
Don't do likethat.

778
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:09,319
You just sayhim atleast
changehis uniform.

779
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:11,988
Why should I tell? If you
want to study, learn.

780
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:13,590
Or stop your
studies & come.

781
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:15,820
No one forced
you to study.

782
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,895
Shehas called a correct to
person to giveher complaint.

783

784

It's okay. Then, what's the
usefinding fault on him?

785
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:27,304
Doesn't haveany sense
who is wearing that?

786
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:30,140
What lacks forthat
dress? It's nice.

787
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,870
Nothing. It's ugly.

788

00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:46,223
Don't talk nonsense,

Neelambara! You go. Then, don't
reveal this dress matter to him.

796
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:58,568
Who will tell this?

797
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,798
This is not amatter to discuss.

798
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:08,311
I justlook that you're

857
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:35,382
This colour uniform is better
than that colouruniform.

858
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:38,621
But he didn't
measure properly.

859
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,816

881
00:58:58,101 --> 00:59:00,103

Why are you late?
- Givethatto her.

886

887
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,093
Whereis Ammu?

888
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:26,462
Ammu has gone inside.
I'm waiting outside.

889
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:29,158
Outside!
Go nearto her.

890
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:33,295

00:59:34,537 --> 00:59:36,539
I can'tgo

00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:37,938
Ammu is in the toilet.

893
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:42,134
Are you standing near thetoilet?
Go away from there.

894
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:49,552

Whereis Ammu? - She is

898
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:06,102
Now I won't get any trouble from
bodyguard forsometime.

899
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,237
Before that, we
should plan.

900
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:11,007
Have you given the

901
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:15,211

01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:30,259
We should make plan

907
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:32,124
Somehow, we
should avoid him.

908
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,388
Oh! God... Has class started?

909
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:39,693

914
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:10,333
Ammu! - What man?

915
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,461
That bodyguard had searched you
in the ladies toiletagain.

916
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:16,205
I don't want to hear that.

917
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:18,074
Answer me what I asked.

918
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:20,243
What is your job in
theladies toilet?

919
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:21,978

920
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:23,046
Unknowingly?

921
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:24,580
I didn't takeseriously

01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:27,183
But after that,
you'rehere only.

01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:15,311
Rafi brother! He had beaten me &
my friends & spoiled our stuff.

991
01:10:15,311 --> 01:10:17,370
That pig...

992
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:25,248
Brother... Jai Krishnabrother.

993
01:10:27,756 --> 01:10:30,726
Who called you as pig,
you scoundrel!

994
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:32,261
Sorry brother.

997
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:38,267
Are you supplying stuffto

01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:40,536
Yes. My boys only...
What brother?

999
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:44,707
You want that place, then I'll
leave it. You takechargethere.

1000
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:48,043
You shouldn't supply drugs
hereafter in that campus.

1001
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:50,212
Not only you, anyone.

1002
01:10:50,212 --> 01:10:51,680
Any ofyour boys
studying there?

1003
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,816
That is my college.

1004
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:58,120
I'm also studying there.

1005
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,755

No oneshould
step in there.

1009
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:10,291
You go, brother. Hereafter these
drugs won't enter there.

1010
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:23,708
This thing got failed even afterwhen
our staff & management tried.

1011
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:27,916
This man has changed
in a singleday.

1012
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:31,818
Hehad chased out
drugs from our campus.

1013
01:11:36,258 --> 01:11:38,988
They had troubled Ammu.
I had interfered then.

1014
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:43,899
It's not only your duty
to protect Ammu.

1015
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:47,036
It's also your duty
to makeher study.

1016
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:49,038

1017
01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:51,438
Not only that, you should
makeher studyin home.

1018
01:11:53,175 --> 01:11:55,939
Oh! I got this
troublealso.

01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:12,925
I feel sleepy. Shall I write
it in themorning?

1020
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:17,499
They got the pass.

1021
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:21,270

1022
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:22,371

Who is he, head master?

1032
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:50,532
A master has come. Why I got
stubborn to comehere?

1033
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:51,934
That life is better

What is theproblem?

1039
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:04,179
Oh! Nothing.

1040
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:07,216
Don't love him
seriously. Justact.

1083
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:21,817
Then, you call that
number & ask.

1084
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:22,918

Disconnect & mind your job.

1302
01:31:13,734 --> 01:31:15,069

1303
01:31:15,069 --> 01:31:17,572

01:31:17,572 --> 01:31:19,474
Then, what do you

1305
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:23,678
I wantto know aboutAmmu

01:31:23,678 --> 01:31:25,680
Why do you

Why are you silent?

Don't you likeifl act
likeAmmu with you?

1310
01:31:39,193 --> 01:31:42,754
You can't act likeher.
You should born forthat.

1311
01:31:44,432 --> 01:31:49,837
Can you imagine, shehadworked
as a staffin her own firm...

1312
01:31:49,837 --> 01:31:53,908
...and had acquaintance with
their staffs likea friend?

1313
01:31:53,908 --> 01:31:57,537
Punnaiyur KadavurAshokan's
daughter is like that.

1314
01:32:00,681 --> 01:32:04,952
This Ashokan brotherwas
arowdy once upon a time.

1315
01:32:04,952 --> 01:32:07,785
Ammu only changed
him as agood man.

1316
01:32:08,589 --> 01:32:13,194
Now Ashokan brother becomes
a God to that village.

1317
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:18,232
Buta good incarnation
is also there.

1318
01:32:18,232 --> 01:32:20,598
That's... OurAmmu.

1319
01:32:23,471 --> 01:32:28,509
In the beginning, I went there & want
to becomelike that Ashokan brother.

1320
01:32:28,509 --> 01:32:33,848
I had a wrong opinion that
wecan achieveby power.

1321
01:32:33,848 --> 01:32:38,853
But sheonly changed
my wrong opinion.

1322
01:32:38,853 --> 01:32:41,989
This Ammu onlytaught me,

1323
01:32:41,989 --> 01:32:47,154
...we'd not dominatepeople with power.
We'd melt them with affection.

1324
01:32:50,932 --> 01:32:55,436
Who won't get angerwhen

1325
01:32:55,436 --> 01:32:58,132
That's why, I
scolded you.

1326
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:04,879
Why are you saying
sorryto me?

1327
01:33:04,879 --> 01:33:07,313
I only did mistake.

1328
01:33:10,885 --> 01:33:15,879
I understand onlynow...
Not Ammu, Jai Krishnan.

1329
01:33:16,857 --> 01:33:18,960

1364
01:35:49,310 --> 01:35:52,780
I didn't sleep &
saw thedream.

1365
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:54,548
I didn't see
that girl also.

1366
01:35:54,548 --> 01:35:55,913
Then, how would
you see her?

1367
01:35:56,684 --> 01:35:58,385
Even I didn't
beatanyone.

1368
01:35:58,385 --> 01:36:00,353
I'vegot your idea.

1369
01:36:02,923 --> 01:36:04,692
Whereis bodyguard?

1370
01:36:04,692 --> 01:36:05,960
To ladies hostel.

1371
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:07,728
Ladies hostel! Why?

1372
01:36:07,728 --> 01:36:11,824
Some girl is calling him
over phone regularly.

1373
01:36:13,701 --> 01:36:17,438
Hehas goneto find
which girl is that.

1374
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:18,973
Neelambaran also
gonewith him.

1375
01:36:18,973 --> 01:36:21,075
First she'd make
call this mobile.

1376
01:36:21,075 --> 01:36:22,810
Then, I'll speak
with her.

1377
01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:25,613
At that time, you should enter
hostel without seeing anyone.

1378
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:28,682
You can find easily
who is that girl.

1379
01:36:28,682 --> 01:36:30,951
Then, what is theuseifl find her?
You don't wantto seeher? Come.

1380
01:36:30,951 --> 01:36:32,953
Then, who will speak
with her here?

1381
01:36:32,953 --> 01:36:34,655
Forthat, we'll
arrangesomeone.

1382
01:36:34,655 --> 01:36:36,213
Oh! God...

1383
01:36:36,657 --> 01:36:39,455
She's calling. - Ask her room
number. I'll catch herthere.

1384
01:36:40,094 --> 01:36:43,825
No. You don't tell thatl'm going
to find her. All thebest.

1385
01:36:44,899 --> 01:36:48,936
Why are you standing before
the hostel in themorning?

1386
01:36:48,936 --> 01:36:51,138

01:36:57,077 --> 01:37:01,649
You can easilyfind me, if you know
phone & room number, right?

1390
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:04,084
Oh! I didn't
think like that.

1391
01:37:04,084 --> 01:37:07,281
Then, you need not

01:37:18,032 --> 01:37:20,933
Whitecomplex,
black chudithar.

1394
01:37:23,070 --> 01:37:24,672
What do you want
to intend to say?

1395
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:27,241
It's lie. Don't you say just
for fun, isn'tit?

1396
01:37:27,241 --> 01:37:30,010
She's also speaking.

1397
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:32,079
So, someoneamong

1403
01:37:40,721 --> 01:37:44,623
She's also speaking.
Perhaps her...

1404

Oh! God... Is everybody

1405
01:37:53,601 --> 01:37:55,535
How could I find her?

1406
01:37:57,238 --> 01:38:01,609
Thief...

1407
01:38:01,609 --> 01:38:02,676

01:38:26,233 --> 01:38:29,136
Don't disconnect.
What's special?

1414
01:38:29,136 --> 01:38:32,973
You too know what is happening
in hostel. Nothing is special.

1415
01:38:32,973 --> 01:38:34,341
Yes, you're right.

1416
01:38:34,341 --> 01:38:36,809
Oh! Neelambaran... You call

1417
01:38:40,347 --> 01:38:42,611
Oh! God... Everybody

1418
01:38:43,083 --> 01:38:46,644
Don't pull me. They
had beaten well.

1419
01:38:48,255 --> 01:38:49,990
Comesilently.

1420
01:38:49,990 --> 01:38:52,693
Oh! God... Whathappenedto you?
- No problem, hejust fell down.

1421
01:38:52,693 --> 01:38:55,062
Myhand fell down.
- Hand fell down! - Yes.

1422
01:38:55,062 --> 01:38:58,632
'0 or 40 college
girls had beaten me.

1423
01:38:58,632 --> 01:39:00,234
No. Only 3 or 4 girls.

1424
01:39:00,234 --> 01:39:01,635
So I miscalculated.

1425
01:39:01,635 --> 01:39:03,938
First they beat
mein my cheek.

1426
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:05,906
So that, I miscalculated.

1427
01:39:05,906 --> 01:39:07,441
Beating. But you said,
you fell down.

1428
01:39:07,441 --> 01:39:08,742
Yes, he has fallen
down by beating.

1429
01:39:08,742 --> 01:39:09,743
What abeating?

1430
01:39:09,743 --> 01:39:13,681
Not a singlebeating.
Everybody beatmewell.

1431
01:39:13,681 --> 01:39:17,251
Then, I had protected

01:39:17,251 --> 01:39:19,887
God... So, you got beaten,
not fell down, isn't it?

1433
01:39:19,887 --> 01:39:23,657
I fell down all ofthem legs, then
onlythey stopped beatings.

1434
01:39:23,657 --> 01:39:25,225
Then, they started beating.

1435
01:39:25,225 --> 01:39:27,394
Why theybeat you?

1436
01:39:27,394 --> 01:39:29,763
Who knows that they
will beat me?

1437
01:39:29,763 --> 01:39:31,432
Won't you be with him at
thattime, Jai Krishnan?

1438
01:39:31,432 --> 01:39:34,134
I got a phone call,
at that time...

1439
01:39:34,134 --> 01:39:36,870
Thatphone call only made
me in this situation.

1440
01:39:36,870 --> 01:39:39,473

Ammu! Read the last
sentence, what I told now.

1444
01:40:07,768 --> 01:40:09,736
Whatare you doing

1445
01:40:11,038 --> 01:40:14,030
Sir! She need not to
takethese notes.

1446
01:40:21,982 --> 01:40:24,177

Who told to go out?

1448

If Ammu stay out from class,

You know everything.
Then whathappened?

01:40:56,583 --> 01:40:59,319

deliver at that time.

1452
01:40:59,319 --> 01:41:01,588
How could you write
exam if you likethis?

1453
01:41:01,588 --> 01:41:04,716
Why is this exam, to send
out from here, right?

1454
01:41:07,361 --> 01:41:09,496
I don't feel to go
away from here.

1455
01:41:09,496 --> 01:41:12,599

Then, I'll haveto
go to London.

1459
01:41:23,677 --> 01:41:27,047
Now I'll feel that I shouldn't
allow that marriage.

1460
01:41:27,047 --> 01:41:29,383
Why are you worrying
about your marriage?

1461
01:41:29,383 --> 01:41:30,751

1476
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:09,756
Becausemany punks follow
him. - Who arethey?

1477
01:42:09,756 --> 01:42:13,160
I'm only following her behind
till now. Who is that?

1478
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:16,630
You should go before her,
notbehind her. Crazy fellow...

1479
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:19,366
Don't mock me. Don't try
to act smartly beforegirls.

1480
01:42:19,366 --> 01:42:22,069

01:42:25,005 --> 01:42:27,774
What? - You'vetold
about someone.

1483
01:42:27,774 --> 01:42:29,002
I didn't tell anything.

1484
01:42:29,743 --> 01:42:31,074
You...

1485
01:42:32,246 --> 01:42:36,483
I won't come. You'll follow Ammu only.
Then, why should I come?

1486
01:42:36,483 --> 01:42:39,975
If you have guts, come.
I'll find you surely.

1487
01:42:40,621 --> 01:42:43,423
Tell herto wear blue
jeans & blue tops.

Is it? Then, why are you
eagerto find her?

1497
01:43:06,046 --> 01:43:08,649

these things, Ammu.

1530
01:46:57,244 --> 01:46:59,246
You'reagirl, whose
betrothal is over.

1531
01:46:59,246 --> 01:47:04,384
God has decided differently. Or... Could have
Jai Krishnan entered in mylife?

1532
01:47:04,384 --> 01:47:06,249
Jai Krishnan doesn't
love you, Ammu.

1533
01:47:07,287 --> 01:47:09,156
I'm not Ammu now.
I'm that girl.

1534
01:47:09,156 --> 01:47:13,650
It's enough ifl livelikea girl, who
madeJai Krishnan to loveher.

1535
01:47:15,128 --> 01:47:18,932
I loveJai Krishnan because ofthe
reasons those you told me.

1536
01:47:18,932 --> 01:47:23,437
Or... Can anybody opposemybrother
entering in our housebravely?

1537
01:47:23,437 --> 01:47:28,542
I feltthatthereitself. Not after
when he camewith me.

1538
01:47:28,542 --> 01:47:35,582
His practical kindness for saving a
servant maids honor, onlymelted me.

1539
01:47:35,582 --> 01:47:43,390
When he toldthathe onlybeat him
& when hesaved oursouls,

1540
01:47:43,390 --> 01:47:45,483
...my loveon him increased.

1541
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:50,597
I never dreamt thatJai Krishnan
is therein myheart,

1542
01:47:50,597 --> 01:47:53,733
...when he is there
as mybodyguard.

1543
01:47:53,733 --> 01:47:58,839
Nobodyincluding my dad, mom and brother
understood melikeJai Krishnan.

1544
01:47:58,839 --> 01:48:04,811
Whom elsel should loveexcept him
& with whom elsel'd live?

1545
01:48:04,811 --> 01:48:08,838
How can I livewith somestranger,
who saw me only once?

1546
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:12,118
Lfyourfamilyknows this,
what will happen?

1547
01:48:12,118 --> 01:48:17,920
Theywill kill him. LfJai Krishnan knows
this, will he accept you?

1548
01:48:18,658 --> 01:48:19,886
Never!

1549
01:48:21,027 --> 01:48:23,196
You told you had started
loving him. It's a madliness.

1550
01:48:23,196 --> 01:48:25,899
Your dad sent him
with you trusting him.

1551
01:48:25,899 --> 01:48:28,568
Can heaccept to spoil
that good character?

1552
01:48:28,568 --> 01:48:32,095
Do you think thatJai Krishnan
betray likethis?

1553
01:48:33,773 --> 01:48:38,945
If you tell him everything, hewill hand
over you to yourAshokan brother.

1554
01:48:38,945 --> 01:48:43,541
Lfhecomes to know your love,
he will do like that only.

1555
01:48:45,685 --> 01:48:51,248
Don't spoil his lifeby your love on him.
You will never get him, Ammu.

1556
01:49:01,601 --> 01:49:05,272
Good morning, dear. You've
called me in themorning.

1557
01:49:05,272 --> 01:49:07,774
Did you get my
thoughtso early?

1558
01:49:07,774 --> 01:49:10,043
I didn'tsleep last night.

1559
01:49:10,043 --> 01:49:16,881
How can I too sleep? I got your
dreams onlythroughoutthenight.

01:49:18,251 --> 01:49:20,549
How was I in your dream?

1561
01:49:21,755 --> 01:49:25,122
You need not dream
about mehereafter.

1562
01:49:26,660 --> 01:49:28,890
I'vedecided to come
in front of you.

1563
01:49:29,930 --> 01:49:33,696
It's a joke. - No.
I will come.

1564
01:49:35,268 --> 01:49:40,140
Is it true? - Why do you doubtme yet

1565
01:49:40,140 --> 01:49:42,642

01:49:42,642 --> 01:49:45,245
Notnow. Next Sunday.

Can you cometo Municipal Park?
I too will come there.

1568
01:49:48,582 --> 01:49:52,541
O.k. Just aminute.
She's accepted to come.

01:49:58,658 --> 01:50:00,990
Oh! He's coming here.

1571

Can you comeat 3'o clock in

1579
01:50:48,308 --> 01:50:53,013
You'd comealone. You'd
notbringAmmu there.

1580
01:50:53,013 --> 01:50:59,653
I won't tell this to Ammu. You didn't tell
me your nameuntil now. Right?

1581
01:50:59,653 --> 01:51:02,722
You're goingto see

01:51:18,505 --> 01:51:20,564
Bodyguard has become
a bodybuilder now.

1585
01:51:21,641 --> 01:51:31,812
What are you doing now, Ammu?
- There's a cruel fun too in our cruelty.

1586
01:51:32,318 --> 01:51:41,022
Who is singingthemelody song?
Is it myheart?

1587
01:51:41,661 --> 01:51:50,660
Can anybody know my feelings?
- Myloveis like amusical tune.

1588
01:51:55,208 --> 01:52:00,246
Myheart plat has blossomed
in your musical love rain.

1589
01:52:00,246 --> 01:52:04,784
Is your lovesweet
likethehoney drop?

1590
01:52:04,784 --> 01:52:09,355
Who has written my story
in theriver shore?

1591
01:52:09,355 --> 01:52:14,360
Who has mademeto
understand about love?

1592
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:18,832
Is shethebeautylike full moon?
Does she have a sweet voice?

1593
01:52:18,832 --> 01:52:23,826
Likehow a sprout
shakes in the breeze...

1594
01:52:41,154 --> 01:52:44,055
We want to go out.
Can you come?

1595
01:52:47,193 --> 01:52:49,462
Jai Krishna! Get ready & come
soon. We'll wait outside.

1596
01:52:49,462 --> 01:52:52,298
I told you that I want to go
to doctortoday, didn't I?

1597
01:52:52,298 --> 01:52:56,336
I fixed this as you told that you have
no any program today. Right?

1598
01:52:56,336 --> 01:52:59,339
I forgot that.
Do a thing.

1599
01:52:59,339 --> 01:53:01,274
We too will come to meet your doctor.
You takeus afterthat.

1600
01:53:01,274 --> 01:53:04,410
That's impossible. Doctor
called me comealone.

1601
01:53:04,410 --> 01:53:07,547
You can getinsidelonely. Why don't
we wait in theconsulting room?

1602
01:53:07,547 --> 01:53:09,315
Doctorwill not accept
itat any cost.

1603
01:53:09,315 --> 01:53:11,684
Whyis that? - That doctor doesn't
have any consulting room.

1604
01:53:11,684 --> 01:53:14,721
Who is that doctor? I want to
seethatpeculiar doctor.

1605
01:53:14,721 --> 01:53:18,491
What's his name? He's not a
great doctorto tell his name.

1606
01:53:18,491 --> 01:53:20,794
Everybody calls him
as doctor only.

1607
01:53:20,794 --> 01:53:25,131
Jai Krishnan is lying. Tell me the
truth. Whereare you going?

1608
01:53:25,131 --> 01:53:29,659
To meet a friend. - Why do you hidethis
if you want to see your friend?

1609
01:53:31,404 --> 01:53:36,432
This friend is a girl friend.

1610
01:53:38,311 --> 01:53:42,015
Girl? - She's studying
in our college only.

1611
01:53:42,015 --> 01:53:45,952
My phonecalls are
that girl's calls only.

1612
01:53:45,952 --> 01:53:49,656
Shewants to meet metoday.
- Is therelove in between you both?

1613
01:53:49,656 --> 01:53:56,229
I loveher. - Thatgirl? How
will shebe? Beautiful?

1614
01:53:56,229 --> 01:54:01,098
I never had seen her. - Can you love
a girl without seeing her?

1615
01:54:01,267 --> 01:54:06,439
She had seen me. I am goingto
see that girl today only.

1616
01:54:06,439 --> 01:54:10,076
If she is not abeautiful girl? - I will
loveher however she maybe.

1617
01:54:10,076 --> 01:54:15,982
If sheis too ugly, -I will love her.
Lovecares about the heart only.

1618
01:54:15,982 --> 01:54:19,076
Beautyis notimportant for love.

1619
01:54:21,154 --> 01:54:24,885
Why didn't you tell us this in time?
You can go. Don'twastetime.

1620
01:54:27,794 --> 01:54:29,591
Let me get ready, then.

1621
01:54:33,233 --> 01:54:36,794
Ammu! What's this?

1622
01:54:45,545 --> 01:54:49,482
I got melted hearing yourwords. Let
metoo come to see that girl.

1623
01:54:49,482 --> 01:54:52,452
Don't come. Shedon't
like your presence.

1624
01:54:52,452 --> 01:54:55,321
Sheasked me not to
roam behind you.

1625
01:54:55,321 --> 01:54:59,259
I will not comein front ofher.
I'll seeher hiding somewhere.

1626
01:54:59,259 --> 01:55:02,528
That's notneeded.
- I need it.

1627
01:55:02,528 --> 01:55:05,986
Jai Krishna! Listen to me.
I wantto seeher.

1628
01:55:19,612 --> 01:55:24,317
Ammu! You stand justhere.
You don't follow me.

1629
01:55:24,317 --> 01:55:29,186
I'll go there & stand. If she comes,
you can seeherthrough this.

1630
01:55:31,591 --> 01:55:34,025
There's no any
confusion, is there?

1631
01:55:36,763 --> 01:55:40,790
Can you tell meall thebest?
- All thebest.

1632
01:56:20,773 --> 01:56:21,933
Oh! God...

1633
01:56:24,777 --> 01:56:28,406
Dear! Have you come?
Where are you standing?

1634
01:56:29,816 --> 01:56:32,944
Have you found me?
- I don't want to see you.

1635
01:56:35,421 --> 01:56:40,526
You won't seemetoday. I told
you not to bring that Ammu.

1636
01:56:40,526 --> 01:56:47,367
You'vehidden herthere.
Are you searching me?

1637
01:56:47,367 --> 01:56:51,771
You'rea stealthy man.
I hate you.

1638
01:56:51,771 --> 01:56:56,776
Dear! I brought herunknowingly,
when Ammu was adamant to see you.

1639
01:56:56,776 --> 01:56:59,645
I too told you stronglynot
to bring her, didn't I?

1640
01:56:59,645 --> 01:57:05,618
How can I believesuch a person, who
doesn't obeymy simplewords too?

1641
01:57:05,618 --> 01:57:08,721
In which beliefl can
love & livewith you?

1642
01:57:08,721 --> 01:57:11,758
You'll deceiveme
all the timesurely.

1643
01:57:11,758 --> 01:57:13,426
Dear! Don't tell
like that.

1644
01:57:13,426 --> 01:57:16,629
I won't do like that.
Now... - No!

1645
01:57:16,629 --> 01:57:19,499
You need nottell anything &
I need nothear anything.

1646
01:57:19,499 --> 01:57:21,868
I won't call you
hereafter. Never!

1647
01:57:21,868 --> 01:57:27,306
You need not wait for my call.
- Dear! - Good bye!

1648
01:57:57,870 --> 01:58:01,307
Whereis she? Have
you sent her? - No.

1649
01:58:01,307 --> 01:58:03,476
She didn't comehere.
- Didn't shecome?

1650
01:58:03,476 --> 01:58:06,446
What happened? - She
had noticed your arrival.

1651
01:58:06,446 --> 01:58:09,142
That's become an
argument in us. -Then?

1652
01:58:11,217 --> 01:58:13,920
She's disconnectedthecall too telling
thatshe'd not call meagain.

1653
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:16,522
It's become atragedy. I'd have
not come with you. Right?

1654
01:58:16,522 --> 01:58:22,328
That's not aproblem. Even if she hadtold so,
shewill call me surely. Watch it.

1655
01:58:22,328 --> 01:58:30,326
Come. I know alreadyit'll happen
likethis, when I fell down.

1656
01:58:32,038 --> 01:58:34,734
How do you haveconfidence
as that girl will call you?

1657
01:58:36,909 --> 01:58:42,281
That girl will call meif she
has apurelove on me.

1658
01:58:42,281 --> 01:58:45,910
Shewill call me.
I am confident.

1659
01:58:56,028 --> 01:58:59,298
What are you doing? Exam has
come. Why don't you study?

1660
01:58:59,298 --> 01:59:03,291
Why should I study? They'd study,
who writeexams. Right?

1661
01:59:06,539 --> 01:59:09,609
I'vecomehere
to protect Ammu.

1662
01:59:09,609 --> 01:59:12,703
I didn't comehereto write
exams & to pass in exams.

1663
01:59:15,214 --> 01:59:18,017
You both studywell.

1664
01:59:18,017 --> 01:59:20,786
Principal & lecturers expect
Jai Krishnan's rank.

1665
01:59:20,786 --> 01:59:24,745
Why don't you writeexams? Lfyou don't
write, wetoo won't writeexams.

1666
01:59:26,192 --> 01:59:29,662
Why don't you both write?
- Why don't you write exams?

1667
01:59:29,662 --> 01:59:34,834
That's why. There's no any problem if
wetoo don't write exams like you.

1668
01:59:34,834 --> 01:59:39,138
Oh no! You both don'tbe
without writing the exams.

1669
01:59:39,138 --> 01:59:44,007
O.k. I will write. -Keep away
the phoneand study.

1670
02:00:17,810 --> 02:00:21,714
What are you doing? You are
spoiling everything again.

1671
02:00:21,714 --> 02:00:25,912
You've seen, haven't you? Lfl don't
call him now, hewon't writeexams.

1672
02:00:27,186 --> 02:00:31,123
Letmecall him only once to make
him to writehis exams alone.

1673
02:00:31,123 --> 02:00:33,887
Afterthat I will
never call him.

1674
02:00:37,363 --> 02:00:38,955
I swear.

1675
02:00:51,344 --> 02:00:53,079
Why didn't you call
me forthesedays?

1676
02:00:53,079 --> 02:00:59,885
I thought you won't call meagain.
You're not angry on me. Right?

1677
02:00:59,885 --> 02:01:06,586
Not angry. I didn't call you to divert
you from yourstudies forthe exams.

1678
02:01:07,860 --> 02:01:09,195
Are you studying well?

1679
02:01:09,195 --> 02:01:14,567
No. I told Ammu that I
would not writeexams.

1680
02:01:14,567 --> 02:01:20,806
Why don't you writeexams?
See! I'll tell you amatter.

1681
02:01:20,806 --> 02:01:25,645
Lfyou don't writeexams, I will
nevercall you & meet you.

1682
02:01:25,645 --> 02:01:28,881
If you had not called me, I would
havenotwritten theexams.

1683

02:22:28,339 --> 02:22:31,638
Why, Ashokan brother?

1865
02:22:34,712 --> 02:22:43,142
Ashokan brother! I told mywifethat
Ammu's hubbyis a lucky man.

1866
02:22:43,855 --> 02:22:47,985
I don't get a chance
to see aperson like him.

1867
02:22:48,660 --> 02:22:54,690
She found him but... I could not get chance
to fulfill her wish.

1868
02:22:56,167 --> 02:23:00,905
Ammu! Whatam I hearing?

1869
02:23:00,905 --> 02:23:07,743
Ammu! I didn't even thought
thatl would see you in this state.

1870
02:23:09,080 --> 02:23:12,914
I knew that yourson camewith you.
Where? Whereis he?

1871
02:23:15,620 --> 02:23:17,889
I forgot it. Siddharth!

1872
02:23:17,889 --> 02:23:19,880
Siddharth!

1873
02:23:26,531 --> 02:23:31,764
Son! Do you know her?
Sheis Ammu aunt.

1874
02:23:41,412 --> 02:23:42,880
Ammu is pity!

1875
02:23:42,880 --> 02:23:48,820
She didn't expect that
situation to save your dad,

1876
02:23:48,820 --> 02:23:51,923
...when helied to
her father & brother.

1877
02:23:51,923 --> 02:23:57,328
Dad! Please! He's telling the truth.
Leave him. -Jai Krishna! You go.

1878
02:23:57,328 --> 02:24:00,598
Dad! He is lying.
Don't leavehim.

1879
02:24:00,598 --> 02:24:03,935
Hedoesn't lie. Let me find
theone, who is lying.

1880
02:24:03,935 --> 02:24:07,005
Go. You too should go there
without his knowledge.

1881
02:24:07,005 --> 02:24:09,507
Leavehim ifthereis any other
girl in therailway station.

1882
02:24:09,507 --> 02:24:11,338
Elsekill him.

1883
02:24:14,178 --> 02:24:15,406
Get down!

1884
02:24:18,149 --> 02:24:23,254
How did they cometo know?
I was denying the truth.

1885
02:24:23,254 --> 02:24:26,290
That's good. You'd
do mea favor yet.

1886
02:24:26,290 --> 02:24:29,394
You'd go to railway station
immediately and meetJai Krishna.

1887
02:24:29,394 --> 02:24:30,762
Me?

1888
02:24:30,762 --> 02:24:34,132

everything...

1889
02:24:34,132 --> 02:24:35,700
& ask him to run from there
without dad's men knowledge.

1890
02:24:35,700 --> 02:24:37,463
Should I go &
tell him? - Yes.

1891
02:24:38,236 --> 02:24:42,473
Dad orderedthem to kill him
ifhis loveris not there.

1892
02:24:42,473 --> 02:24:43,941
Oh God... What
should I do now?

1893
02:24:43,941 --> 02:24:47,612
I'vetold you that only now.
You'dtell everythingto Jai Krishnan.

1894
02:24:47,612 --> 02:24:52,743
You'dtell him that
I'm that phonegirl.

1895
02:24:54,018 --> 02:25:01,481
But you'd ask him not
to comehere & wait for me.

1896
02:25:03,795 --> 02:25:08,499
I won't get marry anyone
even ifit is along period.

1897
02:25:08,499 --> 02:25:10,435
I won't agreethattoo.

1898
02:25:10,435 --> 02:25:14,439
Will he believethis hearing my words?
- There's no othergo.

1899
02:25:14,439 --> 02:25:16,941
Jai Krishnan doesn't have
phonetoo to call him.

1900
02:25:16,941 --> 02:25:22,046
Lfyou go there & call me from
my phone. I'll tell everything to him.

1901
02:25:22,046 --> 02:25:23,479
Come.

1902
02:25:27,051 --> 02:25:30,418
There's no other train today.
This is the lasttrain.

1903
02:26:10,495 --> 02:26:12,292
Come!

1904
02:26:29,080 --> 02:26:36,953
Sethu, Are you that
girl? How I!

1905
02:26:43,161 --> 02:26:45,493
Jai Krishna! I...

1906
02:26:59,610 --> 02:27:01,373
Yes. Okay, Ashokan brother.

1907
02:27:26,838 --> 02:27:31,342
I'veblundered my Ammu,
whatno any friend can do.

1908
02:27:31,342 --> 02:27:37,515
Or... Could I havegota luck to marry
agood person like your father?

1909
02:27:37,515 --> 02:27:43,454
I took your fatherto a long distance so
that nobody could come searching us.

1910
02:27:43,454 --> 02:27:48,492
God hadtaught mea
lesson for mybetrayal now.

1911
02:27:48,492 --> 02:27:55,032
Did you seethat your mom doesn't have
a luck to livewith your dad now?

1912
02:27:55,032 --> 02:27:57,735
That's the lesson of God.

1913
02:27:57,735 --> 02:28:03,107
My son will get this
dairy after my death.

1914
02:28:03,107 --> 02:28:07,511
My son should destroythis
dairy after reading it fully.

1915
02:28:07,511 --> 02:28:13,541
My son! You should not tell
this storyto your dad forever.

1916
02:28:22,860 --> 02:28:24,996
What? Didn't you
sleep until now?

1917
02:28:24,996 --> 02:28:27,398
No. I didn't get sleep.

1918
02:28:27,398 --> 02:28:31,802
Did you cry? - No.
- You should notlie.

1919
02:28:31,802 --> 02:28:35,101
Your father won'tlie. You too
should not lie to me, then.

1920
02:28:36,407 --> 02:28:37,806
Why did you cry?

1921
02:28:40,311 --> 02:28:42,074
I reminded mymom.

1922
02:28:45,816 --> 02:28:50,651
You sleep! I'll
bewith you.

1923
02:28:58,896 --> 02:29:01,592
Are you angry on
mymom, aunt?

1924
02:29:04,835 --> 02:29:10,207
Angry? How can I get angry on
her? Not anger! I got feeling.

1925
02:29:10,207 --> 02:29:15,112
Shedidn't want to meet me
atleast oncebefore her death.

1926
02:29:15,112 --> 02:29:19,984
I havethat feeling alone
on your mom always.

1927
02:29:19,984 --> 02:29:22,976
Forgivemymom
for her guilt, aunt.

1928
02:29:27,325 --> 02:29:29,759
I didn't think
I'd meet you.

1929
02:29:31,462 --> 02:29:35,666
I wantedto see you
both to apologizeto you.

1930
02:29:35,666 --> 02:29:39,670
I was aliveuntil now for
this only. -Don't tell likethat.

1931
02:29:39,670 --> 02:29:44,208

It'll come true. Shall

1941
02:30:48,239 --> 02:30:53,711
Ashokan brother! He never had
seen such an affection until now.

1942
02:30:53,711 --> 02:30:55,646
He's told something
unknowingly.

1943
02:30:55,646 --> 02:30:58,249
