1
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,320
'Bike'

2
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,040
Sir, I'll talk to the
opponent advocate

3
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,720
- Please settle this amicably
- Ok

4
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,920
We shall get money from both parties.
What do you say?

5
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,240
- Listen to me, just lend your support...
- You listen to me!

6
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,840
One tea over here please

7
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,160
Hello! Where are you going?

8
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,640
To meet the hero?

9
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,320
In that case, come here

10
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,120
Our hero is amidst these vehicles

11
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,520
Yes, indeed

12
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,200
Such vehicles are a common sight
in all police stations

13
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,000
These vehicles didn't
make it here on their own

14
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,640
They are here because of silly
mistakes committed by us, humans

15
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,520
There is a story behind
every vehicles that is here

16
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,320
In fact, vehicles have more
experience compared to humans

17
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,920
Amidst all these vehicles...

18
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,000
stands this bike named 'Duttu'

19
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,040
Duttu's journey to this police station...

20
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,120
and the lives of people who
traveled in this journey...

21
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,000
is what we are about to witness

22
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,320
Though Duttu can't speak...

23
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,160
the whole journey from
Duttu's point of view...

24
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,720
will enable us to hear
Duttu's full feelings

25
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,640
The reason Duttu is here...

26
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,160
is because of an official
journey of three guys

27
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,920
Useless! Makes every ones
lives a hell!

28
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,000
Our fate!

29
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,120
He is Rafique

30
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,000
Works in a food van

31
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,520
He is the wake up alarm
for all the colony people

32
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,320
At times, even small kids
are terrified of him

33
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,720
Is it already 6 O Clock?

34
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,120
Stupid! Wonder what these
guys eat for dinner!

35
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,200
Stinky fellows!

36
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,800
It's ok my baby!

37
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,360
Only if I knew these guys toilet schedule,
I can put my baby to sleep at that time

38
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,760
The only thing he does sincerely is...

39
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,760
He chats with few girls and
talks long hours with them

40
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,040
And sleep in between

41
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,280
He toils hard and earns in the night

42
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,080
and spends all his hard
earned money on those girls

43
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,320
Because at least one day he
hopes to win over their love

44
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,960
It's his thoughts that
spoil his livelihood

45
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,600
He is Arun

46
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,120
Works at the two wheeler parking
section in the railway station

47
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,920
But he shows off like he is an
central government employee

48
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,520
Turn off the light!

49
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,520
I said, turn of the
light you swine!

50
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,560
Thank God! It was the back side

51
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,280
He is Krishna. Today, he works in a hotel

52
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,240
Even he doesn't have any idea about
where he'll be working tomorrow

53
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,680
Every problem that he faces because
of his sincerity towards work...

54
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,720
finally ends up at this door step

55
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,320
This is Swathi

56
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,120
What?

57
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,880
Don't brush your teeth
if you can't buy paste

58
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,560
You better lend me some paste or
else it'll stink when I kiss you

59
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,800
Get lost! Like anyone's gonna kiss you!

60
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,760
With the hopes of starting a family
with Krishna in the future...

61
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,480
along with her current job, she
is also preparing for TNPC exam

62
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,280
Now, we're going to see the important
incidents which happened in their life

63
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,040
'Journey for job'

64
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,720
Don't spray it too much

65
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,960
Take a bath once in a while!

66
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,480
Cheapskate

67
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,920
Why aren't you at work already?

68
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,760
Stop playing with the phone!

69
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,720
They are going to
celebrate birthday

70
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,520
Birthday celebration?
Whose birthday is it?

71
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,360
Rafique's girlfriend Manju's birthday

72
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,000
Check this out. This is the fourth time
they are celebrating her birthday this year

73
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,600
Why are you celebrating his
girlfriend's birthday?

74
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,360
Doofus!

75
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,760
Won't you ever change?

76
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,520
Do you have any idea how many
days you took off this month?

77
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,640
Lose this job and you have no other
option but to beg on streets

78
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,360
Have your breakfast and join me
quickly, if you are coming with me

79
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,920
That dinkus is in the toilet

80
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,760
He won't let me eat in peace

81
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,080
Do you have any glue?

82
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,960
- Rafique!
- What?

83
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,240
Are you done?

84
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,000
Why do you ask?

85
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,720
I wanna eat

86
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,800
Just eat your breakfast.
That should be enough

87
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,280
Yuck!

88
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,560
Doofus!

89
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,680
Just returning home, Raghava?

90
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,520
Yes

91
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,640
Time for Father-Daughter affection

92
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,320
There's your dad

93
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,000
Stop it, you 'Alert face!'

94
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,120
Looks like you are on time

95
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,440
Daddy, I have made Dosas
and kept in the box

96
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,840
Just cook rice for lunch,
Sambar gravy is already there

97
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,560
Ok dear

98
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,200
Time to replace gas cylinder.
Ask Krishna to do it.

99
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,480
The agency guy will
take long to get it

100
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,200
Why? Isn't Krishna working today?

101
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,880
Nope. He is at room

102
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,840
He has taken an off to
celebrate some girl's birthday

103
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,680
Who's that girl?

104
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,560
Daddy, don't you confront
him regarding that

105
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,440
He is anyway on off. Just tell him
to get the gas cylinder if possible

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,760
Dear...

107
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,080
you could've told him yourself

108
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,040
Nope. He'll mistake that I'm asking
him to compensate for the food

109
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,760
He'll obey you

110
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,240
Fine. Did he have his breakfast?

111
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,000
- Ask him yourself
- I had

112
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,640
- See you, daddy
- Ok

113
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,800
Why do you exchange key
on the way, everyday?

114
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,240
All of you, out!

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,760
Janu, we need to leave early.
You! Go and bath quickly!

116
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,560
Useless fellows! Look
at the condition here!

117
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,200
You are usually late.
Why so early today?

118
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,080
If you want me to work according to your
schedule then pay me my salary first!

119
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,480
It's been three months!

120
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,160
If you don't pay me this month too...

121
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,200
wait and watch!

122
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,560
Stop giving me hopes

123
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,920
Err... nothing

124
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,320
Quick, leave. I need to
clean the house and leave

125
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,520
What's your problem if we are here?
Just do your work and leave

126
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,120
No need! I know where your
eyes will be if you are here

127
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,400
- 'Wait and watch!'
- Why are you laughing?

128
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,880
I meant you too

129
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,640
Are you planning to make a video
of mine and release it in Youtube?

130
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,160
Uh-oh! I didn't see that coming

131
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,760
These guys can't
even catch a joke!

132
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,040
Someone here seems
to like you a lot

133
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,520
Who's that? Show me

134
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,000
Show me, where?

135
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,920
Over here

136
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,080
Move! Let's go back!

137
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,800
Come on, now!

138
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,720
I am in Dhoti today

139
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,720
What if he attacks me?

140
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,920
You could've come in pants. One
must be expert to wear a Dhoti

141
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,960
One should take any risk
for the sake of love

142
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
In fact...One must!

143
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,320
Only then you'll have a result

144
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,600
Watch her get awestruck looking
at my dressing for her birthday

145
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,600
- Oh God, everything must go fine. Got it?
- Yes

146
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,840
We are crossing the
place Manju said

147
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,800
Where?

148
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,840
Please stop the bus. I need to get down

149
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,880
There's no stopping here

150
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,040
But I must get down here.
It's urgent!

151
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,520
If it's so urgent, jump off the bus!

152
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,120
Jump off the bus?

153
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,480
We can't stop according
to their wish

154
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,680
Yes buddy, jump off the bus

155
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,040
Remember, one must take
risk to get a result

156
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,800
You're right. Come on! Come on!

157
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,840
Come on, buddy!

158
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,600
Jump!

159
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,480
Hey watch out! Your Dhoti! Your Dhoti!

160
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,240
My Dhoti! My Dhoti!

161
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,960
Ewww! Yuck!

162
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Hi Manju

163
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,160
Happy birthday Manju

164
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,360
- Manju!
- Rickshaw!

165
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,840
Please stop the bus

166
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,720
Please, leave at once!

167
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,440
- Oh Jesus!
- Greetings sister

168
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,000
Uh-oh! It's so embarrassing!

169
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,600
Please stop! Stop! Get in!

170
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,720
No one's helping me either

171
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,040
Hey Rafique! Come here! Come on!

172
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,080
Stop! Stop!

173
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,240
- Where did you go, you fool?
- Hop in! Quick!

174
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,720
- Here is your Dhoti
- What's the use now?

175
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,560
Let's go

176
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,560
What happened to Manju?
Was she awestruck?

177
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,440
(Liquor consumption
is injurious to health)

178
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,400
He said she will be awestruck...

179
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,400
but I never expected he'll
make her awestruck like this!

180
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,960
Well buddy, what was Manju's reaction?

181
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,880
Buddy, that girl...

182
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,560
she fled the place at once

183
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,800
Then all the reaction was
not on hers but his face

184
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,200
Yeah right! Enjoy the booze
I sponsor and mock at me!

185
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,960
So be it. Go ahead! Keep mocking at me

186
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,680
To hell with this messaging service!
Messages aren't going

187
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,800
Call up the customer care number and...

188
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,240
give them an earful

189
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,920
Then messages will start working

190
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,200
Whom are you going to give
an earful at this hour?

191
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,480
Have a seat

192
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,120
So, what's the celebration for?

193
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,120
Is it a happy news or sad one?

194
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,400
You didn't know?

195
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,280
Everyone else's knows around

196
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,640
- Today is his girlfriend Manju's birthday
- Damn it! Shut up or...

197
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,920
Stop it, Arun!
You're provoking me

198
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,160
I warn you!

199
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,360
Come on, Rafique!

200
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,360
There are people downstairs

201
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,560
Already, majority of them don't
like you guys staying here

202
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,520
Aren't you aware?

203
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,560
Ask them all to mind
their own business

204
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,320
It's not like they help
us when we need help

205
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,320
Indeed. You are correct

206
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,920
But we must do our job. Isn't it?

207
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,480
If you keep taking off in the name
of such celebration and parties...

208
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,440
then you'll lost your current job. Then
what will you do for a livelihood?

209
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,560
I met George today

210
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,840
He said he'll be coming tomorrow
to vacate the rent defaulters

211
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,760
I just came by to say this

212
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,640
To hell with that swine! He will
keep saying that all the time

213
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,720
Just forget it

214
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,320
Indeed, call him a swine...

215
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,520
but we must pay rent on time

216
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,880
Isn't that our duty?

217
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,720
What ever. Have a nice time
with your celebrations

218
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,800
I am leaving

219
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,880
Why the long face, Krishna?

220
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,320
Don't mind what I said

221
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,680
If not at this age then
when can you guys enjoy?

222
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,600
Continue your celebration.
Carry on, carry on

223
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,120
It's good night time for me

224
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,080
Good night

225
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,560
(Liquor consumption
is injurious to health)

226
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,720
Buffaloes work faster
than these guys!

227
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,840
Guys!

228
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,600
Listen you 'Manga!'
'Manga Mani!'

229
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,200
Work as if it's your own home

230
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,080
Got it?

231
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,000
George...

232
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,480
can't you wait till they arrive?

233
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,440
After all he set out to collect money.
Isn't it?

234
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,720
Ask them to stop it, Charge

235
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,480
Please don't involve this

236
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,920
I got them here to put
an end to all the issues

237
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,640
that you've been trying
to keep me away from

238
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,640
Got it? So, stay quiet

239
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,440
Here they come

240
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,400
Why did you come down?

241
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,840
Go back and keep your things outside

242
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,920
Or else the same will be the
plight of your things too

243
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,360
Like there is anything in your home.

244
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,680
All you got is torn clothes and inners
and I can see them hanging

245
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,360
Instead how about I
strip you guys naked?

246
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,960
It would be quite embarrassing.
Isn't it?

247
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,200
Stop laughing! Like you
have seen us in that way

248
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,720
Mind you! What's your problem?
Come here!

249
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,520
Troublesome fellows!

250
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,640
Can't you guys pay rent on time?

251
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,120
We are paying on time

252
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,040
They never pay the rent on time

253
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,920
They keep paying the
rent like a chit fund.

254
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,680
They pay very less sum
and carry over the rest

255
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,680
Don't you call it rent

256
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,120
All together, 30,000
rupees of rent is pending

257
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,120
George, how can they arrange
if you ask all of a sudden?

258
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,080
Don't talk like this. I gave them the
home because you vouched for them

259
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,040
The paid rent on time
for first two months

260
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,280
And then then started following
this chit fund kinda payment

261
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,760
It's been months now. Wonder from
where they get such new techniques

262
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,360
I won't let go of them this time

263
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,640
Chief Vasu, he'll obey you

264
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,120
Please tell George not to do this

265
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:05,960
Ok

266
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,360
What about next month?

267
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,200
Vasu, don't fall for his words

268
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,320
- What happened?
- Nothing dear. I'll take care of it

269
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,120
- Are you sure? See you, daddy
- Ok dear

270
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,960
Fine!

271
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,680
One more month...

272
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,920
One month?

273
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
Yep, next month

274
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,640
- Yes chief, next month we'll pay
- Listen...

275
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,440
if you guys fail to pay
the rent next month....

276
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,360
George won't come in
search of you hereafter

277
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,880
I'll, myself come in person and
destroy all your utensils and clothes

278
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,240
- Got it?
- Got it Chief Vasu

279
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,560
Krishna...

280
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,720
Aren't you going to office?

281
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,560
No, I must go soon

282
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,320
It's ok if it's a bit late. Start to work

283
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,080
Ok I'm leaving. Keep moving

284
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,280
George, see you

285
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,240
See you! See you!

286
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,640
Unsuccessful trip here and
couldn't empty even one house

287
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,760
Unnecessarily wasted
money on these henchmen!

288
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,160
Tell me

289
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,320
Where are you?

290
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,320
- At work, in hotel. What do you want?
- Aiyo!

291
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,080
So, didn't you take an off today?

292
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,080
- Do you want me to?
- Well, I was wondering

293
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,360
You always look for
reasons to take an off

294
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,120
Did you call to say this?

295
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,840
Don't you have work over there?

296
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,280
I have got enough work

297
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,360
Fine, dad told me what happened

298
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,360
How are you gonna pay
the rent this month?

299
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,120
Why don't you help me?

300
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,160
Me? I don't have money

301
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,120
Fine, then do one thing...

302
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,840
give me your chain for now...

303
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,200
and compensate it while
paying me the dowry

304
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,280
Dowry?

305
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,160
But I am not gonna marry you

306
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,720
There are better choices available

307
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,400
Why? Do you doubt me?

308
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,080
Two Parottas parcel

309
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,960
Krishna!

310
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,560
Did I hire you to flirt with girls?

311
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,040
Turn that off and get on with work!

312
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Hang up, now

313
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,920
Hey! Hello! Hello!

314
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,480
Mr. Burma Face! One day I'm gonna secretly
serve spoiled chicken to some customer

315
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,880
Wait and watch

316
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,560
I'll prove you that a waiter
can shut down your shop!

317
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,080
It's been long since I
placed an order for a Dosa!

318
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,960
You! What are you doing there?
Can't you hear that customer?

319
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,560
He'll come now

320
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,520
- 2 chappathi and a chicken curry
- 2 chappathi and a chicken curry?

321
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,360
2 chappathi and a chicken curry!

322
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,360
Please give me some gravy.
What's the delay?

323
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,800
Hey, serve him some gravy

324
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,720
In a minute

325
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,160
All I have got are lazy workers

326
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,640
I must blame myself
for hiring them!

327
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,840
Hey Krishna. You
are early today?

328
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,880
I'm done with my work

329
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,120
What would you like to have?

330
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,360
Where's chilly chicken?

331
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
It's over

332
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,080
There so much left and why
do you say it's over?

333
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,800
What's wrong with you?

334
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,440
Krishna, he is acting
strange of late

335
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,320
I wonder what's wrong with him

336
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,280
I guess he has gone crazy

337
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,760
Rani, four Idlis parcel please

338
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,560
One omelet

339
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,360
You swine! Can't you
eat where you work?

340
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,840
Pour him some Sambar gravy

341
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,440
That Burma face will
compensate my salary

342
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,240
And also, that food doesn't suit me

343
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,680
And this doesn't suit my wallet!

344
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,920
If you guys eat like this, I
hardly get 50% of my salary!

345
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,480
- Quick, an omelet
- Wait

346
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,720
Quick

347
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,080
Well, here comes rest of them to
finish of my remaining salary

348
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,120
Hello Rafique!

349
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,760
How are you , Mani?

350
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,680
Listen Malar, don't trouble
them when they are eating

351
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,840
- Don't disturb! Leave! Leave!
- Come here. Come here!

352
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,680
Here, have this. Come back later. Ok?

353
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,000
What do you want?

354
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
Pour him some gravy

355
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,720
Mr. Vasu, aren't
you getting down?

356
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,760
I wonder if you'll
eat from my shop

357
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,040
Rani, then why did I come
all the way to your shop?

358
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,200
No one can beat the taste of your food

359
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,480
Look, how my guys are
gobbling up the food

360
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,600
Fine...

361
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,400
Get me an Idly, a Vada with some fish gravy

362
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,400
Ok

363
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,680
He isn't here for her Idly and Vada...

364
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,120
He is here to eat and compensate for the
dispute that took place today morning

365
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,680
Look, how his men are gobbling

366
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,520
Like pigs!

367
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,000
There goes my one week salary

368
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,800
Hey, get me some gravy.
What are you doing there?

369
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,000
- Give it over there
- Rafique, come here

370
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,720
Here, take this and give it to him

371
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,400
Coming

372
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,040
Handle this

373
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,560
- Omelet?
- Make it yourself

374
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,040
Give this to Chief Vasu

375
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,400
Go

376
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,080
One half boil please

377
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,720
One half boil

378
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,280
Why don't you make it?

379
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,280
- How are you?
- Good. And you?

380
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,880
Who's phone is this?

381
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,040
Here, attend it

382
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,720
Hello

383
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,120
This is a food van shop and you are?

384
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,800
Salim Bhai?

385
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,480
Salim Bhai? Give it to me

386
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,120
Hello, Salim Bhai...

387
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,240
Tell me, bhai

388
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,360
Oh, it's Salim bhai's phone?

389
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,120
It was here in the car

390
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,440
No bhai, we just halted for dinner

391
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,120
Sure bhai. You will get the
phone tomorrow morning

392
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,120
Sure bhai

393
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,120
Ok bhai

394
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,400
I'm off to Coimbatore
it's an urgent matter

395
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,000
Ok

396
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,560
- I'll be back only tomorrow night
- Ok

397
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,360
- Ensure this phone reaches Salim bhai
- Ok

398
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,720
- Got it?
- Ok

399
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:03,760
Ok

400
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,080
Where can I find Salim bhai?

401
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,640
Go to east police station
and ask for Dubai Salim...

402
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,760
everyone knows him well

403
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,440
East pol...in that case, I'll give
it to him. He works that side

404
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,120
Over there

405
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,280
Call him

406
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,400
Krishna

407
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,320
Come here

408
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,240
This fellow? Isn't he your friend?

409
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,240
Yes chief

410
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,920
Where's the third guy?

411
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,440
He'll be asleep in room by now

412
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,880
Krishna, this phone has to be hand over to a
person tomorrow. It's your responsibility

413
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,520
Whoa! Apple phone!

414
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,400
Listen...

415
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,320
It's Salim bhai's phone. Do not hand
it over to the wrong person. Mind you!

416
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,720
Don't worry. I'll pass
it to the correct person

417
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,640
He'll do it

418
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,400
I'll inform Salim bhai. Hand
it over to him by morning

419
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,120
Ok

420
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,280
Ok chief

421
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,200
Listen...

422
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,400
Remember about the
rent next month

423
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,640
Do inform that third guy too

424
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,640
- Don't forget. Now, you may leave
- See you

425
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,480
Looks awesome, isn't it?

426
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,280
One plate idiyappam

427
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,400
Sir, what would you like?

428
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,840
- 2 Dosai
- 2 Dosai?

429
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,360
- 1 onion uthappam
- 2 Dosa and 1 onion uthappam

430
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,200
Krishna, why don't you buy
a new phone like this?

431
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,760
I'll have to sell myself

432
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,440
You mean it's that cheap?

433
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,520
You think that was funny?

434
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,640
- Try some new joke
- Krishna!

435
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,080
What are you chatting over there?

436
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,240
- Customers waiting in family room
- Get on, he has already began yelling

437
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:19,920
Hello

438
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,040
Come in late and works like a lazy!
To hell with...

439
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,280
Madurai Muniyadi Vilas

440
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,240
There! Again playing
with the phone?

441
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,800
Go, take order before the
customer loses their cool

442
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,400
Come here and ask for Krishna

443
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,360
Ok

444
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,480
I must snatch his phone first

445
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,680
I will serve spoiled chicken
someday, Mr. Bruma Face!

446
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,000
They don't turn up regularly and if even
they turn up, they while their time away

447
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,680
Hello

448
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,560
Yes, Salim bhai?

449
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,040
At the Sait's Pan shop

450
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,920
Ok bhai

451
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,040
Bhai's new phone?

452
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,760
Ok bhai

453
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,160
Which hotel?

454
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,760
Krishna?

455
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,240
Make it fast

456
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,240
Can't you understand
their English?

457
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,000
They want to check the mobile

458
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,480
They'll delay it and
hand it over back

459
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,400
It's not delay it. It's delete!

460
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,760
Empty plate? Serve him some
bread and shut his mouth

461
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,560
Madam! My phone! Madam!

462
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,760
- What do you want, sir?
- I already ordered

463
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,640
Someone, attend him

464
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,320
Who's Krishna here?

465
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,240
Krishna, someone's here looking for you

466
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,760
- Is that him?
- That's Krishna

467
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,360
Are you Krishna?

468
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,440
- Salim bhai sent me
- Salim...

469
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,880
Don't you have Salim
bhai's phone?

470
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,560
Phone...phone...

471
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,720
Start the bike. Quick

472
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,880
Wait! Stop!

473
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,680
You chased away a customer and
now you leave. What's going on?

474
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
To hell with you Mr. Burma Face!

475
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,840
Like this is a navy job!

476
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,480
Even animals won't work for you, you
idiot, doofus, dinkus, crap, stupid

477
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,960
Don't you hit me!

478
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,840
Let's go! Come on

479
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,840
That was embarrassing

480
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,000
How did you miss the mobile?

481
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,800
A woman thought I was clicking
their photo and snatched it away

482
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,560
- Do you know which rickshaw?
- No

483
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,960
At least the registration number?

484
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,080
I didn't notice it

485
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,120
Neither you know which rickshaw
nor the registration number

486
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,560
How will you find them in this city?

487
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,960
Give me that mobile number

488
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,160
- Which mobile number?
- The one which you came to collect from me

489
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,840
Yes, Salim bhai's new number

490
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,000
Yes, that number

491
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,680
Kindly say it slow

492
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,640
Doofus! Unwanted headache

493
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,360
She cut the call

494
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,560
- This rickshaw?
- She switched it off!

495
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,200
What do I tell Salim bhai?

496
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,680
You leave. I'll talk to Salim bhai

497
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,600
Salim bhai asked me to
return with the phone

498
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,880
I know chief Vasu very well.
You leave

499
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,120
Do what ever you want!

500
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:30,320
"This is where the plot thickens"

501
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:37,680
"This is where the plot thickens"

502
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,920
Hello

503
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,480
You rascals!

504
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,840
Where's that stupid friend of yours?

505
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,880
Answer me!

506
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,280
Chief Vasu...well...

507
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,320
Where were you guys
roaming with the phone?

508
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,880
- Trust us, we didn't sell it. We lost it
- Lost it?

509
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,880
- I don't care! Get the phone
before I reach there tonight - Ok

510
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,960
I don't care what you do

511
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,000
He disconnected
the call, doofus!

512
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,680
What did he say?

513
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,160
He has warned us that we must
get the phone by tonight

514
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,920
What were you doing when
they snatched away the phone?

515
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,240
I let her go because of the Mr. Burma face!

516
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,640
Watch out! Phone!

517
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,480
It's switch off right

518
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,320
If I get hold of her, I'll take
some chilli powder and...

519
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,680
- I'll take that and rub it on her...
- Rafique!

520
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,240
I must rub it...at
least on her eyes

521
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,160
Why abuse her? Why did he click her photo?

522
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,760
He thinks he is a
short film maker!

523
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,440
Upload whatever you recorded in
Youtube and whatever you earn...

524
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,800
use it to buy new phone
and give it to them

525
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,720
Swathi, clicking a
photo isn't a sin!

526
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,160
How can they snatch the phone?

527
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,200
That's not fair

528
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,120
Listen...

529
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,240
I didn't click their photo

530
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,520
Then why did they snatch it away from you?

531
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,560
Photo isn't the problem here

532
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,720
The problem is him interrupting
them when they were romancing

533
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,480
He spoiled their good time
and she got pissed off

534
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,440
- Romancing?
- Well....

535
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,840
Step out you guys!

536
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,800
I said, step out you guys!

537
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,320
It's Chief Vasu

538
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,520
What do we do now, Raghavan sir?

539
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,800
You commit all the blunders,
they why ask him?

540
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,640
What can he do? Your chief!
Chief Vasu is here. Go!

541
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,240
You go talk to your chief.
Don't involve my dad

542
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,880
Daddy, don't you go. They'll invite
troubles and then ask your help!

543
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,480
Shut up and stop it! This is my
problem and I know how to solve it!

544
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,240
- You!
- Chief

545
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,400
Go get them

546
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,280
What is it?

547
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,000
It's quite dark. I'm scared

548
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,600
You're scared? You! You go!

549
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,000
Guys! Wait!

550
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,920
If all of you leave, then I
must be alone here. Wait

551
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,360
No one go there. Call
them out from here

552
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,440
- Step out!
- Guys, step out!

553
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,760
Please stop him. Please

554
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,400
Come here!

555
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,120
Chief, there he comes

556
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,720
Krishna! Listen to me!

557
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,560
Wait! Hold on! Stop!

558
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,960
I know what to do

559
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,960
- Please forgive me
- Me too

560
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,920
You rascals!

561
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,760
Where's the phone?

562
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,440
I swear, we didn't get it back yet

563
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,520
You didn't get it?

564
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,400
Call him!

565
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,000
Call him!

566
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,920
Whom?

567
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,600
What do you mean 'whom?'

568
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,680
So, you don't know

569
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,360
Didn't I make it clear that
it was Salim bhai's phone?

570
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,480
Call him

571
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,080
Call him!

572
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,280
- What's the issue?
- No idea

573
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,760
Vasu...

574
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:41,720
troubling them won't
get you the phone back

575
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,960
Listen!

576
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,600
I know how to get back
the phone from them

577
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,360
You, shut up!

578
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,960
- Manga, check him
- Ok chief

579
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,200
Check them thoroughly

580
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,560
Chief, this phone is quite loud.
It's the model that I have

581
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,480
Holy guacamole!

582
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,680
You rascals!

583
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,400
Where did you sell off the
phone worth 0.1 million?

584
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,880
I promise, we didn't
sell it off anywhere

585
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,760
Promise

586
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,200
I don't care if you sold it or not

587
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,480
I need that phone, now!

588
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,520
Vasu...

589
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,720
no one here has the guy to take
a phone from you and sell it

590
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,480
Poor guys, they missed
it somewhere by mistake

591
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,240
Give them sometime to
retrieve it back, Vasu

592
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,920
Ok

593
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,960
One week

594
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,320
I give you a week's time

595
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,760
I need the phone by then

596
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,640
Or else...

597
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,040
I'll be back

598
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,560
Then...

599
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,600
I'll abduct you and your daughter first!

600
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,880
Here

601
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,520
Start the jeep

602
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,440
One week!

603
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,360
One week is all you got

604
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,560
Mind it!

605
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,280
I need the phone before that

606
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,760
And if I don't get it...

607
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,360
I'll rip you guys apart

608
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,920
Let's leave

609
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,960
Krishna, who is Salim bhai?

610
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,440
What kind of a person is he?

611
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,920
How about we go and
talk to him once?

612
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,000
I tried talking to him.
Didn't work out

613
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,840
What happened?

614
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,040
Well, for sure we are getting bashed
but it has been postponed by a week

615
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,960
How are you going to
return the phone?

616
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,160
What's the guarantee
you'll retrieve it back?

617
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,360
If not, I must buy them a new phone

618
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,280
Really? That was funny!

619
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,000
How will you buy one? He talks as if
he is an IAS officer. He quit his job

620
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,920
Why do you even
vouch for him, dad?

621
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,800
One who lost the phone
must take responsibility

622
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,720
This is my problem! No one need to
intervene. I know how to solve it

623
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,280
Krishna!

624
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,040
- Same dialogue. Same build up
- Krishna!

625
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,920
Krishnakumar!

626
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,280
It's because of such jerks, rogues
come here and create a scene

627
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,200
How do we even live here?

628
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,400
Next time the pest control is here,
I'll ask them spray in your mouth!

629
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,560
- Get lost!
- Rascal!

630
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,080
What are you looking at? Here,
take this and get inside

631
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,040
Why did you talk
to him like that?

632
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,800
How many times have I asked
you to control your temper?

633
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,800
Come on, now. Fine,
go serve the food

634
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,560
Keep supporting him always!
Get lost!

635
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:15,960
Hello!

636
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,880
Krishna! Where are you?

637
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,360
Buried underground. Who is this?

638
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,200
Oh! You are still hung-over from yesterday

639
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,000
This is Raghavan speaking

640
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,480
(Liquor consumption
is injurious to health)

641
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,400
Tell me

642
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,160
Come here at once

643
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,000
Why?

644
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,320
I have spoken with someone
regarding your job

645
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,920
What job?

646
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,120
We can discuss it in person

647
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,200
Start now

648
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,440
Better take an auto rickshaw

649
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,880
He will be leaving soon

650
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,440
(Liquor consumption
is injurious to health)

651
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,480
Hey!

652
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,440
Rafique!

653
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,240
Spare me 150 rupees

654
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,320
(Liquor consumption
is injurious to health)

655
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,160
Here it is

656
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,400
For what?

657
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,960
Ragavan told me to take
an auto rickshaw and come quick

658
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,440
I don't have the money

659
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,840
I have only 60 rupees left

660
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,120
I spent for the booze and food yesterday

661
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,080
Why don't you ask him for money?

662
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,320
I will pay for the bus fare to his place

663
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,640
How can I spend for Sheelu with this?

664
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,040
Where are you two leaving?

665
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,520
I don't care where you go

666
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,880
But give me an answer before you go

667
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,440
This is the third month for me

668
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,640
God! We are not responsible for that

669
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,120
It is your due amount. Who else
should I ask?

670
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,320
Janu! You'll get your
salary in two days

671
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,880
You are saying this for
the past three months

672
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,040
Hurry, it's already late

673
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,160
Guys! Please give me my money

674
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,800
I would have given it if I had

675
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,680
How long should I excuse you guys?

676
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,080
I have kids to feed

677
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,160
How will I manage?

678
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,960
Kids? Are you married?

679
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,760
Yeah! Some marriage it was

680
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,240
My husband went to booze with his friends
on the day of marriage

681
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,000
It has been 12 years, I have not
seen him since

682
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,000
The kids?

683
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,800
Give me the keys

684
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,480
They were God's gifts

685
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,360
We cannot deny it. Can we?

686
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,160
Janu! Is it true that two guys tried
to snatch your chain?

687
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,360
It's true! I was returning
from advocate Thamba

688
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,320
house after work... At
that time two thieves

689
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,000
came speeding to snatch my chain

690
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,000
Thank God I pushed them away or else
I would have lost my chain

691
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,760
Stay safe. There are lots of unemployed
crooks roaming around the city

692
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,640
How did you know about it?

693
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,040
Rama from downstairs told me

694
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,680
Guys! When will you pay the money?

695
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
We are going out to collect your money

696
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,040
You will get it in two days

697
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,760
Take this

698
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,800
Come here

699
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,640
You sure those guys
came to snatch your chain?

700
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,640
Sure! They moved their
hands to me like this

701
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,840
Like this?

702
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,520
I am not sure if they came
to snatch your chain

703
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,560
I don't have any money

704
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,400
Are you serious?
Dude!

705
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,720
Don't keep your helmet on the bike

706
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,680
- I won't be responsible if you miss it
- Give me some money

707
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,480
I told you I don't have any

708
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,760
You better ask Rafique. He is
the responsible for this

709
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,160
If he had the money why would I come to you

710
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,080
He paid for yesterday's booze and food

711
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,600
You didn't care whose money it was
while boozing yesterday

712
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,160
Who boozed off?

713
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,320
I had only one round of drink

714
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,560
- You finished the rest
- Who finished the rest?

715
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,000
I don't know about it. I had
only one round of drink

716
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:41,680
Don't try to fool me. I
poured the drinks for you

717
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,960
First he had one, then another...

718
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,680
I remember perfectly

719
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,200
I left a few pints in the
bottle before I slept.

720
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,800
Both you and the pint were
missing in the morning

721
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,680
So?

722
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,200
You know when I came to work?

723
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,200
- You rascals!
- Hurry up, soon

724
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,520
- Faster
- Guys! Pay for the parking

725
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,560
You filthy low life scum bags

726
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,040
- I don't have the change
- Take this

727
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,520
- I don't have the change either
- It's Ok

728
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,280
They didn't even get the parking receipt

729
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,240
She looks decent but
talks like a trash

730
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,760
Here take this. It's your lucky day,
they went without getting the change

731
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,680
This is not enough

732
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,200
This is all I have

733
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,680
If the owner knows
about this I am done

734
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,680
- Leave now
- Bye

735
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,080
Hello!

736
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,960
Krishna! Are you here?

737
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,240
Yeah I am inside the complex now

738
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,720
I am at the hospital right now,
I will be little late

739
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,240
Hospital? What happened?

740
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,840
A minor accident in work place

741
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,840
Accident?

742
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,800
How did it happen?

743
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,640
Don't panic! Nothing to worry about

744
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,600
You do one thing

745
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,120
There is a company named
'Trademark finance' in the second floor

746
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,600
You will find a person named Sundharam

747
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,080
I will get these medicines from the
pharmacy and wait for you outside

748
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,680
Meet him and tell my name

749
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,280
Shall I come there

750
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,760
Don't bother about me

751
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,880
- I am already leaving the hospital
- Ok

752
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,120
Krishna!

753
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,280
Don't talk about this accident to Swathi

754
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,960
She will panic and get scared

755
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,080
Ok

756
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,760
Krishna!

757
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,040
You desperately need a job now

758
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,520
Keep that in mind

759
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,600
Understood

760
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,640
Alright

761
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,640
I will call you later

762
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,720
How much did you
score in 10th grade?

763
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,560
"136"

764
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,080
You embarrassed about that?

765
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,200
Don't be. This is the
perfect score for your job

766
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,640
Vignesh! This is Ragavan's reference

767
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,400
Ragavan is not only my security,
I have known his since my struggling days

768
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,720
You know who Vignesh is?

769
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,120
He is everything here. He is the
manager of this firm

770
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,520
Then... what is the status
of the T.nagar client?

771
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,160
No shit man! They've been waiting their
bum for me downstairs

772
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,440
I was about to meet them but Uma
dragged my bum inside to meet yo

773
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,320
Ok you can leave but be
flexible with the client

774
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,400
Okay

775
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:34,920
Hello!

776
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,600
Yo Sathish! Move your lazy bum!

777
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,440
Hello!

778
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,960
What are you looking at?

779
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,000
That his dress and
accent are contrasting?

780
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:49,320
Will the behaviour of a rag picker change
if you give him new name and clothes?

781
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,520
Yes, I need men like him for my profession

782
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,560
Coming to the point, your
job is collecting money

783
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,400
All my money is spread in the form
of vehicle dues, finance and chit funds

784
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,120
You are responsible for collecting them.
Is it ok?

785
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,680
Do you have a bike? A vehicle

786
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,080
It is very essential for this job

787
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,640
I will give you the money for gas

788
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,760
If you impress me in the first two months,
I will buy you a new bike

789
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,720
Your salary is Rs 15,000/- . I'll pay
you incentives if you collect more

790
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,160
Sir

791
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,040
If you are ok with these conditions,
you can start from tomorrow

792
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,760
If not I'll find someone else

793
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,040
But I want you to decide right now

794
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,120
Because I am already
lacking manpower of late

795
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,880
If you are interested, come early
tomorrow morning

796
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,200
- Inform Ragavan about this
- Thank you, sir

797
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,720
- How much is it?
- 50,000 rupees

798
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,760
- See you
- Ok

799
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,720
The tablets made me a bit dizzy

800
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,000
Am not used to English medicine,
so I thought I would have some tea

801
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,080
Are you better now?

802
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,320
Nothing serious right

803
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,240
Nothing serious now. I
even started for work

804
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,320
but everyone compelled me to
rest, so I came back home

805
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,440
Have the tea

806
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,720
Sundaram spoke to me. He asked
you to join tomorrow right?

807
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,640
The job extracts a lot from you but....

808
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,120
using this job position we can ask
Sundaram to help us with the money

809
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,920
That money will be automatically
deducted from your monthly pay

810
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,560
I am not compelling you

811
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,080
It's not like that

812
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,520
I need a bike to take up this job

813
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,320
They have asked me to bring a bike

814
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,960
Why? Don't they provide the bike?

815
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,440
Yeah! After two months

816
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,920
Until then I would get only gas money

817
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,840
Buses won't be an option for this job

818
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,880
It may even cost you
more than a bike

819
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,920
Why don't you ask you
friends for help?

820
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,440
I have asked Rafique

821
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,520
Is that Rafique?

822
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,080
Alright! Arrange for the bike soon

823
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,520
Somehow you have to take up
the job tomorrow

824
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,040
You want the bike by tomorrow?

825
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,200
I have to join work tomorrow. It will
be better if I get it by tonight

826
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,840
What can I do in such short notice?

827
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,440
You know Jeeva right?

828
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,280
Which Jeeva?

829
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,920
The Jeeva who peddles
customs goods in Parrys

830
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,760
He has a bike. Check if it is available

831
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,480
I don't know that guy

832
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,480
Why don't you talk to him

833
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,720
Sorry dude! I not in
good terms with him now

834
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,720
I can't speak with him

835
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,680
It's not a big deal but he will ask
for a month's rent in advance

836
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,200
Shall we meet him?

837
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,040
Ok! I'll take care

838
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,200
Whose bike is this?

839
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,200
This is Kumar's

840
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,760
This is used for bringing goods to the shop

841
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,640
I will call you if I get a bike

842
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,560
Ok

843
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,160
Swathi! I think I have to
take a tablet before dinner

844
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,560
Bring me the tablet
and some water

845
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,000
You didn't need my help for anything.
Why don't you go take the tablet yourself?

846
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,080
You need someone only
to pass you the tablet?

847
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:02,880
My child...

848
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,680
Are you still thinking about it?

849
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,120
I already explained myself

850
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,840
You would have panicked and took a day
off, that's why I did not inform you

851
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,800
I won't panic or take day off anymore.
I won't care even if someone dies

852
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:19,280
The world will stop spinning
if I take a day off

853
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,040
Why didn't you inform
me about the accident?

854
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,640
Your dad asked me not to

855
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,840
Oh! Now it's my dad

856
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,400
So my dad is not related to you.
Is that it?

857
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,160
Swathi! I am already in
high pressure situation

858
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,440
Don't mess around now

859
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,480
I thought you considered
him as your dad too

860
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,760
Now I clearly see that you only
use him for your gains

861
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,840
Swathi! Is it Krishna?

862
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,280
Ask him about the job

863
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,000
He went for a bike, don't
know if he got one

864
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,680
I don't care about others matters.
You ask for yourself

865
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,160
She is crazy

866
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,200
She wants me to consider her dad
as my own dad

867
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,640
She finds new ways to start a fight

868
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,920
Ragavan! As your dad?

869
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,720
Awesome

870
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,000
It's simple dude!

871
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,600
Ragavan has worked as security
in many places

872
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,920
So Swathi may have had a doubt. Isn't it?

873
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,120
Stop talking like a fool and think what
we should do next

874
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,560
Or else we all will be in a big trouble

875
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,080
What you expect us to do?

876
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,080
We have checked all our contacts

877
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,240
Jeeva will give his bike in three days.
What is there to worry?

878
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,080
To hell with three days

879
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,800
Why are you pissed off on me?

880
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,440
Ask him

881
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,520
Arun

882
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,840
Everyday hundreds of men park
their bike in the morning and...

883
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,000
take it only in the
evening right?

884
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,520
Some bikes will be left
unchecked for weeks too

885
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,960
Yeah, so?

886
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,680
If we get a bike like that, we can
manage these three days

887
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,240
You want me to steal?

888
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,080
Steal?

889
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,160
It's wrong

890
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:57,720
It's not a theft, it's just
an adjustment for three days

891
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,080
Adjustment? Don't talk about this again

892
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,440
You want me to lose my job?

893
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,840
It's not some lame food
van business like yours

894
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,320
It's controlled by the
central government

895
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,960
Vasu will put us in trouble if
we do not return that mobile

896
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,160
What trouble? The person who
started it should end it

897
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,520
Vasu will not cause me any harm

898
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,200
Oh! So that's it

899
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,720
Yeah

900
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,840
You are right

901
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,360
He has nothing to do with it

902
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,600
He has done nothing wrong,
why should he be in trouble

903
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,200
We will take care of it ourselves

904
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,200
Since we are friends, Vasu will think we
are all in this together

905
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,120
I will tell Vasu that you
are not involved in this

906
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,000
It's ringing

907
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,720
Chief Vasu! It's Rafique

908
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,840
You crook! Did you get back the phone?

909
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,600
No... I called you to
say about something

910
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,520
If you give me any lame
excuse, I will butcher you

911
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,800
It's not that

912
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,400
- My friend...
- Which friend?

913
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,320
- The cheat who lost the phone?
- No not him

914
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,440
It's about my friend Arun who
works near the railway station

915
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,440
What about him? Is he dead?

916
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,800
No

917
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:15,320
He is saying that if we
do not get the phone...

918
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,080
he is saying that you don't
have the guts to thrash us

919
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,760
- I never told so
- I will teach you brats a hard lesson

920
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,240
It was not us, it was him who said so.
You speak with him

921
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,120
You said I don't have the guts?

922
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,560
I didn't mean that

923
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,280
If I see you...

924
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,520
I will slaughter you

925
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,560
If I don't get the phone...

926
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,440
- I never told so brother
- You will die first

927
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,560
I don't have guts?

928
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,160
Do I look like a fool to you?

929
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,440
Why are you acting so cheap?

930
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,720
Are you not ashamed?

931
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,280
Rafique! What's happening there?

932
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,720
Nothing. Sit down

933
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,520
Who is acting cheap?

934
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,360
You used us for the food and booze...

935
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,800
and distance yourself if we are in trouble.
This is cheap behaviour

936
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,200
We are not asking for
your help to save us

937
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,280
Like he said, Ragavan and Swathi
should get into any trouble

938
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,360
We have a house to sleep today only
because of Ragavan. Don't forget it

939
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,000
Krishna!

940
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,360
I am not scared of Vasu

941
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,080
I am dead scared about that Mani

942
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:40,360
I am afraid that pig will screw us up
and ruin our lives

943
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,800
How will I get married then? Even
if I did, what about the kids

944
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,040
It's over

945
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,800
Just for three days right

946
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,400
I will see what I can do

947
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:07,200
It's ok. It is controlled by the central
government. Why should you bother yourself?

948
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,680
I can handle any government

949
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,560
Our future depends on this

950
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,880
You can't turn back now.
Let's hear the plan

951
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:25,000
In your parking, there will definitely be
some bike which can be unlocked with any key

952
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,400
You need to find a bike like that

953
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,320
Find it and call him

954
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,120
Every morning, drive that bike
away without raising any alarm

955
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:37,080
After finishing your work drop the bike
in its place at 5.30 pm every evening

956
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,560
If you can do this for three days, we
can get Jeeva's bike on the fourth day

957
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:46,200
Another thing. It is better
if that bike has an helmet

958
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,160
Police won't stop you and it
protects your head too

959
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:52,880
Sir!

960
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,920
Will you be late to take it back?

961
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,320
Why? Are you going to charge me more?

962
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,040
You don't have to pay
more for late hours

963
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,560
- Then why is he asking
- He asked me too

964
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,080
What is happening?

965
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,800
Nothing serious

966
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,920
I just wanted to arrange late bikes
separately so you can take it out easily

967
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,400
People who are coming early are finding it
difficult to take their bikes out. That's why

968
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:16,480
If my train arrives on time,
I will also be on time

969
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,440
Hello

970
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,960
TN 02...

971
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:20,960
H...

972
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,720
Listen...

973
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,000
Bike is ready

974
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,760
The don't waste time. Don't be late

975
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,400
All the best

976
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:33,640
Thanks

977
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,800
Krishna...

978
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,800
- Haven't you started?
- I'm about to

979
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,320
My friend has arranged a bike.
I'll take it on my way

980
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,200
Is it?

981
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:43,120
Fine, then have your breakfast
and start immediately

982
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,920
- It's ok. I'm not hungry
- Not hungry?

983
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,680
Then why did I toil hard and make it?

984
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,200
I'm keeping it in the bag.
Eat when you feel hungry

985
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,760
What about me Swathi?

986
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,920
- You starve!
- Rafique!

987
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,880
I haven't had my breakfast yet. We
can have it together at my place

988
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,800
That bike doesn't need a key.
That's just a dummy key

989
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,880
What, no key?

990
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,760
I searched and I couldn't
find a better option

991
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,840
I got only this one

992
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,280
Look yellow and yellow

993
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,560
What else do you need
for a good sign?

994
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,120
Fine, leave! Leave!

995
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,280
Be back by sharp 5:30

996
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,240
Or else I'll committed suicide by
jumping in front of 5:45 train

997
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,840
- Come here
- What is it?

998
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,880
If I don't reach by 5:30, don't
jump in front of 5:45 train

999
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,000
Wait for the train after that. Ok?

1000
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,600
"Why does it feel like all
eyes are fixed on him?"

1001
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,880
Sir, I'm coming from
Trademark finance company

1002
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,280
I am Krishna. I have
joined here new

1003
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,960
"Fears are all that is left.
Fear is all you got"

1004
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,240
"What are you gonna do?"

1005
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,760
Just ensuring it
doesn't cause traffic

1006
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,160
"Fears are all that is left.
Fear is all you got"

1007
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:26,920
"Why does it feel like all
eyes are fixed on him?"

1008
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,960
"Why does it feel so?"

1009
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,280
"He is running the race of his life"

1010
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,320
Done?

1011
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,360
I haven't begun yet. How
will I be done so soon?

1012
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,320
"He keeps running"

1013
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:46,160
"Fears are all that is left. Fear is all
you got. What are you gonna do?"

1014
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,080
"Fears are all that is left.
Fear is all you got"

1015
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,880
"Fears are all that is left. Fear is all
you got. Where will you end up?"

1016
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,720
Promise, it's my bike

1017
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,280
"Do you want to
forget your worries?"

1018
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,520
"Then go ahead and party!
Party! Party!"

1019
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,120
"Party and you can fly"

1020
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,520
"So party hard! Party! Party!"

1021
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,000
"Do not stop, keep pouring!
And raise hell"

1022
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,440
"There is no person on
earth who is worry-free"

1023
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,720
"So change your
thoughts and get high"

1024
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,640
"Learn to fulfill your desires!"

1025
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,480
"Time to play hide and seek"

1026
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,960
"Come, give it a shot!"

1027
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,240
"Chase away the fear"

1028
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,680
"Come, let's touch the peak"

1029
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,960
"Come, let us win over fate"

1030
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,360
"Come, lets cross
all the hurdles"

1031
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,720
"Come, lets bear all the burden"

1032
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,080
"Lets take this new path"

1033
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:11,840
"Will the fate favor us or betray us?"

1034
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:16,800
"Did you try asking the God about this?"

1035
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,560
"She has a heart full of love for
you; so do not push her away"

1036
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:26,240
"She carries your burden too"

1037
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:31,480
"She is the shadow that
keeps following you"

1038
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,440
"So when will you hold her hands?"

1039
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,000
"Do you want to
forget your worries?"

1040
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,400
"Then go ahead and party!
Party! Party!"

1041
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,800
"Party and you can fly"

1042
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,240
"So party hard! Party! Party!"

1043
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,560
"Do not stop, keep pouring!
And raise hell"

1044
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,080
"There is no person on
earth who is worry-free"

1045
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,600
"So change your
thoughts and get high"

1046
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,800
"Learn to fulfill your desires!"

1047
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,120
Today is the last time. I
can't help you after this

1048
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,960
Come back as early as possible

1049
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,240
Go, get on with your work

1050
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,640
- I meant that. Come soon
- Move! I gotta go to work

1051
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,240
This is why I don't help you guys

1052
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:19,640
"Will the fate favor us or betray us?"

1053
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:24,640
"Did you try asking the God about this?"

1054
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:29,360
"Why does it feel like all
eyes are fixed on him?"

1055
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,520
"Why does it feel so?"

1056
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:39,200
"Fears are all that is left. Fear is all
you got. What are you gonna do?"

1057
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:42,720
"Fears are all that is left.
Fear is all you got"

1058
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,240
Hello

1059
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,360
Where are you?

1060
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,640
At office

1061
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,520
Buddy...

1062
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,520
I don't know when that
bike's owner will turn up

1063
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,120
Don't irritate me. I'll come

1064
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,960
Useless! Look at his attitude
changing once he is done getting help

1065
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,680
Well, this gets over today!

1066
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,040
Park there

1067
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,600
What if asks again tomorrow?

1068
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,720
Let him and see
what I do to him!

1069
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,880
'Good times are here!
Good times are here'

1070
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,320
'Deity Jakamma says!
Good times are here!'

1071
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,840
'The deity is here!
Good times are here'

1072
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:21,920
The bike will be back

1073
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,400
Stop!

1074
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,960
- Uh-oh, you got me into trouble!
- Sorry buddy

1075
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,120
- Are you trying to escape
- No sir

1076
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,560
The bike skidded when
I applied the brakes

1077
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,080
Stop buffing and go present
the documents to the officer

1078
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,880
- Sir, I'm in a hurry...
- Park the bike now!

1079
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,920
- Sir, I have an important work...
- You heard me!

1080
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,600
Come with me

1081
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,680
Go

1082
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,000
Alandur, sir

1083
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,600
Take the RC book and
show it to the officer

1084
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,200
Do we look like fools?

1085
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:51,800
Stop! Stop!

1086
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,880
I wonder where the RC
book for this bike is?

1087
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:55,960
What's this?

1088
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,400
Didn't you show the documents yet?

1089
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,800
Sir, I'm unable to open this

1090
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,960
Go say that to the officer

1091
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,400
Go, meet the officer!

1092
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,760
Just a minute, let me open it

1093
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,120
I said move!

1094
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,680
Sir, the original is at home.
I only have the photocopy

1095
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,960
I asked you for the original!
You pot head!

1096
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,600
Go, get me the
original documents

1097
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,680
I said, leave!

1098
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,640
Sir, chain snatching, attempt to murder...

1099
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,400
that bike looks exactly like
the one missing in those cases

1100
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,360
He is standing right behind you

1101
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:28,880
My hands!

1102
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,080
Damn helmet!

1103
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,560
Were you born with this helmet?
Remove it!

1104
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,480
You guys scold us either if we
don't wear and now if we wear it

1105
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,320
What?

1106
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,400
You, son of a gun!

1107
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,760
You thief! You cheeky thief!

1108
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,880
- Sir my hands! My hands!
- You'll steal bikes....

1109
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:53,080
then steal chains! Confront you and
you'll hit us with the helmet?

1110
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,000
I am innocent, sir!

1111
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,480
- Then? Then?
- Sir!

1112
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,720
Sir, stop it. People
are watching us

1113
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,520
It'll become a public issue

1114
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,560
If someone records it and put it up
on social media, we'll be done for

1115
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,480
Where do you stay?

1116
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,520
Saidapet, housing board

1117
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,480
Saidapet, housing board?

1118
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,240
Do you know 'Nightmare' Vasu?

1119
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,040
I am doing this job for his sake

1120
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:16,960
There you go!

1121
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,800
Sir! Rivet confirm, sir!

1122
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:23,320
Sir, he works for Saidapet Vasu.
Hope you know him

1123
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,200
So what?

1124
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,400
Keep moving

1125
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,960
Go to your bike

1126
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,720
Is he a big thug?

1127
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,680
Of course!

1128
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,200
You leave it. I'll cool him down
and bring him to the station

1129
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,040
Trust me, sir

1130
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,760
No need. I'll bring him myself

1131
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,280
Only then I can establish an
understanding with him on the way

1132
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,560
You head to the station.
I'll take care of it

1133
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,080
Ok sir

1134
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,120
Come, let's go

1135
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,440
Sir, why do you want me
to come to the station?

1136
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,680
Come on! Police station
is for the public

1137
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,200
Anyone can come and go

1138
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,080
Police department is your friend

1139
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,080
Come, pay a visit just like that

1140
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,120
It's already 5:45!

1141
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:10,160
Looks like I'll have to jump in
the next train as per his advice

1142
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,240
What if someone would've
recognized the bike?

1143
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,440
Sir, helmet?

1144
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,760
Why would a police need helmet?

1145
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,880
Attend the call

1146
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,040
I love to hear other
people's conversation

1147
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,800
It's ok. Just a friend's call

1148
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:35,400
I haven't reached home and hence he is
messaging asking if bike ran out of petrol

1149
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,320
Petrol?

1150
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,520
There you go

1151
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,160
Sir...

1152
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,000
I think it ran out of petrol

1153
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,960
I only hear jingle sounds!

1154
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,560
- What's your friend's name?
- Arun

1155
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,280
Ask him to gulp hot tar!

1156
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,560
Thank god, he didn't message
asking if you got hit by a truck!

1157
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,520
Fine, push the bike. Come on

1158
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,960
Sir, my hand is hurting

1159
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,640
So, do you want me to push?

1160
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:13,520
Yes sir

1161
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,280
Sir because my hand is aching

1162
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,840
Fine, at least help

1163
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,920
I wanted to be a cop
like Surya in Singham!

1164
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,160
And he made me push
the bike in streets

1165
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,760
- There or here?
- This way

1166
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:29,720
That way?

1167
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,960
Park it this way

1168
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:41,880
How much fuel?

1169
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,120
How much should I fill sir?

1170
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,480
For how much?

1171
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,880
Your wish, sir

1172
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,000
My wish?

1173
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,560
For the bike you stole...

1174
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,400
Sir, I didn't steal the bike

1175
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,280
Fine, for a bike that
you didn't steal...

1176
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,800
why should I spent money
and pay for petrol?

1177
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,640
Well sir, I don't have change

1178
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,360
No money?

1179
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,720
I swear, not even a penny

1180
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,360
Just wait. Look sir...

1181
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,600
5 rupees

1182
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:12,920
an it's torn

1183
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,760
Why do you even use a purse?

1184
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,800
Here, have it as a tip

1185
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,640
Sir, we shouldn't
carry an empty purse

1186
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:27,920
Sorry bro....

1187
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,880
Fine, pour for 20 rupees

1188
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,760
Sir, minimum is 50 rupees

1189
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,280
Sir, minimum is 50 rupees

1190
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,280
Kindly adjust and
pour for twenty rupees

1191
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,000
Sir...

1192
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,360
shall I go check with
the manager, first?

1193
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,920
Why do you wanna disturb
the manager for this?

1194
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,920
Pour for fifty rupees! Useless!

1195
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,560
Sir, please open the tank

1196
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,320
Open the tank!

1197
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:09,960
Pour

1198
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,320
Doofus!

1199
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,200
One key for all the bikes?

1200
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,360
Looks good?

1201
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:38,080
Ask your manager to start a credit
account in the name of Somasundaram

1202
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,400
Go! Get lost!

1203
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,200
Sir, the manager will scold me

1204
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,800
Why so late, sir?

1205
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:52,840
Did he create any problem?

1206
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,000
Nothing of that sorts

1207
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:58,640
Useless! A short fellow embarrassed me
at the petrol bunk by asking me to pay

1208
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,520
What is it? If it's that friend
then attend and talk to him!

1209
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,640
What if he sends a message
and jinx things once again?

1210
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,920
- Hello
- Hold the bike

1211
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,560
The police caught me

1212
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,520
Can you come to Mylapore
police station?

1213
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:10,640
Bring Rafique also

1214
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,120
Now, what was that?

1215
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,280
All that hand twisting
was unintentional

1216
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,760
Why are you calling your men?

1217
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:23,040
Sir, they are my friends. Only if they come,
we can explain you what's the reality

1218
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,000
So they are coming just
to explain things....you!

1219
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,640
What are you looking at! Move!

1220
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,960
Move you Mr. Chilly nose!

1221
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,640
- Come, let's go in
- No sir. I shall wait here

1222
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,400
I'll come once my friends are here

1223
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:39,000
After all this is a silly issue

1224
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,920
Let's talk it out

1225
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,280
Why troubling them?

1226
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:46,280
The police department is your friend.
I am here! Don't you worry! Come on!

1227
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,920
Why are you so innocent?

1228
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,400
This case is definitely going to be a
pain in the head of Somasundaram sir!

1229
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:56,520
That's how Duttu ended up
in this police station

1230
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:00,520
Duttu might stay here
and rust to death

1231
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:05,000
Or else Duttu can tell us what happened
earlier in his life and escape

1232
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,520
Until then, time for Duttu to rest

1233
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:14,840
I agreed to this fearing that Manga Mani!
Looks like now the police will take over!

1234
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,800
Keep your mouth shut till we get there

1235
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,880
You started blabbering without
knowing what happened

1236
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,480
Come closer

1237
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:25,720
How will the police know that we
stole the bike from railway station?

1238
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,600
They won't?

1239
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:30,600
Then why did they catch him?

1240
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:35,040
Even if you wear helmet and have all the
bike documents, police will catch you...

1241
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,760
for very silly reasons like side mirror

1242
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:40,800
You are right

1243
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,880
That bike does not have a side mirror

1244
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,040
We have no right to beat him in the
middle of the road?

1245
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,120
What if someone record and upload it?

1246
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:50,000
Pay him

1247
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,520
I don't have any

1248
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,200
- This is the bike
- This one?

1249
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,200
What is your case?

1250
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,640
Violence, theft, rape....

1251
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,400
We are not here for that

1252
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,840
We are here to meet a friend

1253
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,160
Name?

1254
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,240
Krishna

1255
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,520
Oh! The vehicle case guy

1256
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,040
Yes

1257
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,040
Come in

1258
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,240
Let's go in

1259
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,600
Inspector is interrogating inside.
You wait here, I'll inform him

1260
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,560
Ok

1261
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,880
Will they beat you up
just for a side mirror

1262
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:30,000
Sir! Did he confess?

1263
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,080
He didn't

1264
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,080
He is very stubborn

1265
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,760
He is replying only in Hindi

1266
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:38,120
- Don't you know I hate Hindi
- Sir, he is a Bengali

1267
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,400
- Bengali?
- Yes

1268
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,240
Get up you bangla

1269
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,120
You are not from here

1270
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:50,640
What if you are a Bengali

1271
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,480
Won't you learn to speak Tamil?

1272
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,880
Even Tamil people are refusing
to speak in Tamil these days

1273
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,280
How can we expect him to

1274
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,040
it's better if you learn Hindi

1275
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:01,880
What the...

1276
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,600
I am a Tamilian

1277
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:06,440
I failed in class 10 several times
because of Hindi

1278
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,880
His friends have come for him

1279
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,880
Ok. Inquire them and let him go

1280
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,240
Sir! I was talking about his friends

1281
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,040
This guy here is an orphan

1282
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,320
Bash him up!

1283
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,800
You won't speak Tamil if you are an orphan?

1284
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:26,760
Hereon you should hear only Tamil anthem

1285
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:28,400
Kolaveri song?

1286
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,120
It's an urgent call from the shop

1287
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:36,560
What?

1288
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,120
I can't come. You finish the deal

1289
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,880
Butchering is enough

1290
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,840
Cut only the leg

1291
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,160
It's his friend

1292
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,360
Don't call me for such petty issues

1293
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,280
Can't you talk quiet?

1294
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:57,640
Why are you bringing these guys
inside the police station?

1295
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,960
Sir! He was talking about chicken legs

1296
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,000
- Chicken
- Chicken?

1297
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,400
He is working in a roadside eatery

1298
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,800
Call that chicken in

1299
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:11,440
Call him in

1300
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:12,760
Call him

1301
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,200
Come in

1302
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,480
Stand here

1303
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,160
Move

1304
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,680
Who is working in the road side eatery?

1305
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:23,360
It's me

1306
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,160
Don't you speak for your stature?

1307
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,560
You talk and behave like a hit man

1308
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,480
What are you doing?

1309
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:31,720
In railways...

1310
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,880
Railway superintend

1311
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,920
No, in railway station bike parking

1312
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,360
Sir! He must be the master brain
behind the bike theft

1313
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,880
I am not like that

1314
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:41,960
Then what are you?

1315
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,040
We did not steal

1316
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,240
It was a small adjustment

1317
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,240
Shut up you....

1318
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,400
Rascal

1319
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,320
Adjustment my foot

1320
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,960
Did you call the person
who filed the complaint

1321
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:59,680
The mobile phone of the woman who
lost the phone is switched off

1322
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:03,120
The person who came with
her was an honest man

1323
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:05,480
I gave him missed call, he returned my call

1324
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,400
He is on his way here

1325
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:11,040
Sir! We did not get any information
from the east police station

1326
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,520
I gave them several
missed calls but no reply

1327
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:16,760
You gave missed call to a police station?

1328
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,440
You are talking like it
is your wife's house

1329
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,320
You fool!

1330
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:24,080
Why didn't you call them
with the station's phone?

1331
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,360
Outgoing calls are not
working in that phone

1332
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:26,960
Sir

1333
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,320
The man who gave bike
complaint has come

1334
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:33,000
I told you about a honest guy who
returned the missed call right

1335
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:33,960
It must be him

1336
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,800
Show him the bike and helmet and
see if he can identify

1337
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:41,560
Move

1338
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,600
Get the helmet you clown

1339
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,320
Move fast

1340
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,840
The man you beat up when stealing has come

1341
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,240
It was not us

1342
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:57,360
We will decide that

1343
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:01,720
If he identifies you as
the culprits, then...

1344
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,960
Sir! One of the bike has no records

1345
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,000
Let them in

1346
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:07,920
Come in

1347
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,680
They have parked in a no parking area
near our station

1348
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,000
They have no records or helmet too

1349
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,880
What sort of hairstyle is that?

1350
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:20,600
Like birds nests

1351
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:23,160
How can they wear
helmet on this?

1352
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,200
You catch easy targets like no
parking and fill up your pocket

1353
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,960
You fool

1354
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,920
Get 500 rupees and let them go

1355
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:35,640
Move on

1356
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:36,400
Thank you sir

1357
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,280
Look at them laugh

1358
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,280
He has identified the bike and helmet

1359
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,800
- Is it so?
- Yes

1360
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:49,440
Call him in

1361
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:50,680
Let him see them

1362
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,240
- Ok sir
- Let him come

1363
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,240
Come in

1364
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,840
Krishna! Rafique! What are you doing here?

1365
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,000
Sir! What did they do?

1366
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,000
What is he telling?

1367
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:11,880
He is asking me about it

1368
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,840
They hit you in the head
and stole the jewels

1369
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:15,960
Sir!

1370
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,400
They are not the thieves

1371
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,680
I know these guys.
They are genuine guys

1372
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:24,360
You told that he identified
the bike and helmet right?

1373
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,040
Yes sir

1374
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:27,480
Yes, I identified
the bike and helmet

1375
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,600
But it was not them

1376
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,640
They confessed that they stole the
bike from the railway station

1377
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,240
- Yes
- Then what?

1378
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:36,600
We did not steal it

1379
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:37,880
It was a small adjustment

1380
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:38,920
Adjustment?

1381
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,920
I explained you
everything about it

1382
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:43,960
I don't believe you

1383
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,360
Sir!

1384
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,480
Let it be what...

1385
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:50,760
If they are really the
thieves like you think...

1386
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:51,840
they should be punished

1387
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,120
I agree with you but...

1388
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,800
they did not beat and steal the jewels

1389
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,640
Please let them go

1390
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:00,480
Then?

1391
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:02,840
Are you saying I am wrong

1392
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:08,080
You are saying that I could not find the
real thieves and putting the blame on them

1393
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:09,240
Sir!

1394
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,320
I did not mean like that

1395
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,560
If they are book under suspicion...

1396
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,240
their future will be spoiled

1397
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:19,320
They are just kids. Please show mercy

1398
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:24,040
What shall I do? You know
the missing bike 'Duttu'

1399
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:28,160
A missing case has been registered
on that bike in east police station

1400
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:32,400
Adding to that we have two
more cases including your's

1401
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:33,320
Alright!

1402
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:37,960
You can take back your
complaint since you know them

1403
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,040
But what about the
other petitioners?

1404
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:43,280
We should answer them also right

1405
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:46,240
None of the petitioners
saw the thief's face

1406
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:52,320
But under these circumstances, what
if they identify them as thieves?

1407
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:54,640
We can do one thing

1408
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,120
We should find the criminal

1409
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:02,800
We should start by finding the person
parked the bike in the railway station

1410
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,560
Then...

1411
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,640
Sir! The bike was parked in the station...

1412
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,200
I can identify those guys

1413
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,280
How did they look?

1414
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,120
Name?

1415
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:18,640
I don't know about that but I can
definitely identify them if I see

1416
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:19,400
Really?

1417
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,240
You remember the day when you came
to get some money from me

1418
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,520
Look at the inspector while speaking

1419
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:25,880
Two days before

1420
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:29,320
Two guys parked that bike

1421
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:30,880
I asked them for parking money

1422
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:34,520
They gave me 100 rupees and ran
away without getting the change

1423
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,520
Sir! Can you do anything now?

1424
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,280
What can I do?

1425
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:43,880
We don't know anything about those guys

1426
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,320
If I know their whereabouts...

1427
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,760
I will catch them right now

1428
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,040
I will do one thing

1429
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,920
I will let you bail them out

1430
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,640
But they have to come to the station
everyday and sign the ledger

1431
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,880
Whenever I call, you should come here

1432
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:01,680
Ok sir

1433
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,080
If they don't show up

1434
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:06,040
Make sure to lock him in and beat him up

1435
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,120
I will

1436
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:09,360
Complete the formalities and let them go

1437
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,600
Go on

1438
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,480
Thank you sir! Let's go

1439
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:18,720
Let me know if you get any
information about those guys

1440
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:19,880
- Ok sir
- Move on

1441
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,160
Like the policemen said, in this case...

1442
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:30,280
the petitioner takes the final call

1443
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:33,120
Then why do we have this court
and legal system?

1444
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:34,760
Be practical

1445
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:37,280
You think the legal system is fair?

1446
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:40,880
A single case will eat
up half your lifetime

1447
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:45,040
Why are you saying them these things? They
don't seem to understand the seriousness

1448
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:50,560
If we can get the address of the lady
who bought the jewels, we can talk to her

1449
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:54,600
What about people who have filed the
missing bike complaint

1450
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:58,480
First we shall meet the lady,
then we can think further

1451
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,760
Being sad is not going to help anyone

1452
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,000
We shall talk about this tomorrow

1453
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:05,960
Now leave

1454
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,560
Have dinner and sleep

1455
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,480
You have made me jobless now

1456
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,240
Are you happy?

1457
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,920
You still have the job, stop whining

1458
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,120
It's almost gone

1459
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,160
You guys have ruined everything

1460
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:28,640
Yeah, we did everything
to make you jobless

1461
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:30,480
As if you are a government employee

1462
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:32,520
Why are you getting angry on me?

1463
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:35,280
You speak as though we did
everything with bad intention

1464
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:37,840
Police checking the
bike is a usual thing

1465
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,800
How do I know about
that bike's history?

1466
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:43,040
He is right. Why did you
give that bike to him?

1467
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:44,640
What?

1468
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:45,760
I gave him the bike?

1469
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:46,520
Yes you did

1470
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,120
How do I know about
that bike's history?

1471
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:50,880
I am asking the same

1472
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:55,600
Stop complaining and start
thinking what should we do next

1473
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:56,800
Get lost

1474
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:02,000
Krishna! Arun! No use in talking like this

1475
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,920
We have only one way to get out of this

1476
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:05,640
My Lord!

1477
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,680
Will you please stop giving ideas

1478
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:08,840
We had enough already

1479
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,560
We are in this situation
because of him

1480
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,520
Ok, I won't give my idea

1481
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,720
Ok tell me about your idea

1482
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,560
For now, we all...

1483
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:21,640
will have two beers

1484
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:22,680
Beer?

1485
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,520
At this time?

1486
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,480
We need to drink beer to cool down

1487
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,320
We will booze off and sleep, we can
think about the rest later

1488
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,000
Does this look like
a joke to you?

1489
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:36,960
This is not a simple issue
to cool down after a beer

1490
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,160
He is right. Beer
will not cool you now

1491
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:43,400
Buy some hot drinks

1492
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:44,480
Crap!

1493
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:47,080
Ok! Give me the money

1494
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,720
We will finish two rounds and talk later

1495
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:49,800
Give him

1496
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,920
I have only 100 rupees

1497
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,000
Brother!

1498
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,920
(Liquor consumption
is injurious to health)

1499
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,960
1 half brandy and 2 beers

1500
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,360
We are closed

1501
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,120
Please help me out brother

1502
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,080
Please help me

1503
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:10,480
If I help out everyone,
when will I close the shop

1504
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,160
I should also go home

1505
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,320
Shanmugam! Give this man
alone and close the shop

1506
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,160
What do you need?

1507
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,680
2 beers and 1 half brandy

1508
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:29,800
Where are your eyes at?

1509
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,200
Why are you driving so rash?

1510
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,200
Bhai! Is that you?

1511
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:37,080
I thought someone
was fooling around

1512
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,800
You don't recognize me?

1513
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,520
We went to your shop.
Are you on leave?

1514
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:45,880
You would have been a goner if I
had not pressed the brakes

1515
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,960
He is looking at the girls. Let's leave

1516
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,360
Ok see you

1517
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:54,040
Well, looks like you are going for a ride

1518
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:01,600
We are going to be like this for
the rest of our lives

1519
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,120
We are not going to get back the phone

1520
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,640
- It's gone for good
- The phone is ringing

1521
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,120
Who is on the line?

1522
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:11,640
- Who is it?
- The missing phone

1523
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:12,720
Her?

1524
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:16,640
What happened?

1525
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,040
- She is hanging up the call
- Give it to me

1526
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:21,400
I will put her to shame

1527
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,160
No, I will put her entire family to shame

1528
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:24,960
Rafique! Calm down

1529
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,000
- Hello!
- Hello!

1530
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,640
It's some guy

1531
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:29,600
Give it to me

1532
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,600
- Hello!
- Hello!

1533
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:32,480
Sir!

1534
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,000
The mobile you are using is mine

1535
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:40,040
I did not record you
kissing your wife

1536
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,600
You would have checked it

1537
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:42,680
Sir!

1538
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,560
Please return my phone

1539
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:46,680
Sir!

1540
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,400
Alright! Where should I come?

1541
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:49,960
Where you want me to come?

1542
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,120
Think everything is fine

1543
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,400
You decide the place

1544
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,120
You come to the restaurant
where we first met

1545
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,880
What is the name of
that restaurant?

1546
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:58,320
Madurai muniyandi vilas

1547
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:01,080
- Where is it?
- Near east police station

1548
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,160
Ok, we'll meet tomorrow morning

1549
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:04,960
- Ok
- Your name?

1550
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:07,440
Krishna Kumar

1551
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,240
- Ok
- Thank you

1552
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,040
Why are you calling him
to that restaurant?

1553
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:15,520
I thought he would know the place
but he seems to have forgot it

1554
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:17,400
Thank God!

1555
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,680
Our path is clear now

1556
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:23,800
If we get those thieves all
our loops will be closed

1557
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:26,400
Wherever they are,
I will catch them

1558
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:40,800
"Dragged in to a complex mess,
looking for a easy way out"

1559
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:48,000
"I am looking for answers in the
a place that isn't my forte"

1560
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:56,200
"Times are tough and
may the Lord save me"

1561
01:13:56,720 --> 01:14:04,200
"I will divert my attention only
after I find an answer to this"

1562
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:08,040
"Only after find an answer!"

1563
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:12,480
Look!

1564
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,000
- Looks like some programme
- Come, lets groove in

1565
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,800
Is this really necessary
at this hour?

1566
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:18,840
Look at him

1567
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:21,360
We must enjoy when the tides
are against us! Come on!

1568
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:30,320
Hello. Won't you pick my calls?
I was worried

1569
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:33,960
I was attending a programme.
Didn't hear the ring

1570
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,760
Can't you call back
seeing the missed call?

1571
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:38,280
You guys create all the issues and
left without giving any information

1572
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:39,880
Won't I be worried if you
don't attend calls too?

1573
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,400
Fine, tell me what's the matter?

1574
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,320
Where are you?

1575
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,520
- Nearby. Why?
- Did you get them?

1576
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:45,360
Who?

1577
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,240
Those thieves

1578
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:51,400
Of course. The found us and
begged us to catch them

1579
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,480
We got confused and then caught them

1580
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,920
They are in my pocket. I'll
come there and show you

1581
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:01,440
Don't worry. You are innocent

1582
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,280
Everything will be fine soon

1583
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,160
Ok?

1584
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,400
Who was that? Swathi?

1585
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,680
I have always been a trouble to them...

1586
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:14,200
never have I ever did
something useful for them

1587
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:18,920
Yet, just because I didn't attend the call,
she gets worried and calls me over and again

1588
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,080
Why do they love me so much?

1589
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:23,840
That's how some people are, Krishna

1590
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,360
They unnecessarily drag
trouble into their lives

1591
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:31,560
But you are lucky fellow, Krishna

1592
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,440
The reason Swathi scolds
you and fights with you...

1593
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:37,320
it shows her love for you.
Now, that's real love

1594
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:43,840
This ain't like the
crap digital era love

1595
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,280
- Understand it
- Feelings! Feelings!

1596
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:49,440
Indeed! It's love feelings!

1597
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:52,600
You must fall in love to
understand such feelings

1598
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:55,040
Yep! Like this is the right
time to fall in love

1599
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:59,880
I am wondering, how will I tell my parents
that I am soon going to be behind bars

1600
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:00,760
And you talk to me about love

1601
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,560
Tell them you were on a foreign trip

1602
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:03,600
Stop kidding, Rafique

1603
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,520
Welcome sir

1604
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:08,880
If you keep taking off like this
then I'll have to hire someone new

1605
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:10,920
Hire if you want. I don't
have a problem with it

1606
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,240
What happened to you, Rafique?

1607
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,880
I was just kidding. Why
are you getting upset?

1608
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:17,840
What do you want? Parotta or Dosai?

1609
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:18,800
Dosai

1610
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:22,080
Make it fast

1611
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:25,360
Bhai...

1612
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,160
How was the programme? Awesome?

1613
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:28,320
We saw you there

1614
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:31,280
Where are your friends?
Did they leave?

1615
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:32,480
They are over there

1616
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,880
Oh. Ok. Ok. Carry on

1617
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,320
4 parottas, 4 chappathis
and chilly chicken

1618
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,880
Puli, help him with the parcel

1619
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:40,560
In a minute

1620
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,440
You got beef?

1621
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:45,120
Don't you want me to run this shop?

1622
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:48,840
Remember I told you that I saw
two girls near the liquor shop?

1623
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:50,840
They are in that car. Check it out

1624
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,800
Don't turn at once.
They might get alerted

1625
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:54,360
They look awesome. No?

1626
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,600
What's so awesome about it?

1627
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:58,040
- They could be lovers
- Indeed, yeah!

1628
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,280
My foot!

1629
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:01,240
I'm telling you, they
are just a set up

1630
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,760
Look there, those two guys
who came with them...

1631
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:06,720
see that beard guy?
He is waiting to buy the food

1632
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:10,840
Those guys are small time gangsters.
They always roam around with such girls

1633
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:15,360
Even a fraction of their fate
would've brought us some good times

1634
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:16,600
What are you looking for?

1635
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,840
Krishna, isn't that him?

1636
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:20,920
Whom?

1637
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:22,680
Remember?

1638
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:24,800
The guys who left the
bike in the parking

1639
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,040
He is one among them

1640
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:27,840
Arun, you must be mistaken.
It can't be them

1641
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,360
I swear, it's him!

1642
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:30,800
I hope it's hot

1643
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,440
It's indeed him!

1644
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:34,960
Krishna, stop! Stop! Wait!

1645
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,080
Arun, stop him!

1646
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:45,480
Krishna!

1647
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:48,320
We are wandering looking for you
and you are have a nice time?

1648
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,640
Who are you man?
What's your problem?

1649
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:52,040
I'll tell you my problem! You jerk!

1650
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,400
I don't get it

1651
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:55,080
Arun! Stop it!

1652
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,760
Hello boss! Why are
you hitting him?

1653
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:00,880
- They are from rich families
- I don't care who they are!

1654
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:03,320
It was them! They left the
bike at the railway station!

1655
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,280
It's indeed them! Catch them!

1656
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:09,600
Arun, catch them!

1657
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:14,240
- Hey, who the hell are you?
- Shut the heck up!

1658
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:16,240
Stop that accent and speak
your mother tongue!

1659
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,280
Your cases aren't free today.
So, get down and get going

1660
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,640
Or you guys will suffer
along with them!

1661
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:55,800
"Everything will come
to light one fine day"

1662
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:58,440
Krishna

1663
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:04,120
"Justice will prevail
over injustice!"

1664
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:13,440
"Everything will come
to light one fine day"

1665
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:22,000
"Justice will prevail
over injustice!"

1666
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:16,120
Here!

1667
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,040
Get up! Run!

1668
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,120
Get them!

1669
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:29,280
Don't let them escape

1670
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:30,320
Blow properly!

1671
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,320
Sir, he is not drunk

1672
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:37,920
Then let him go

1673
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:39,880
Go! Leave!

1674
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,960
And he calls himself police!
Useless fellow!

1675
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:44,760
Ready sir

1676
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:49,800
Listen, do not miss those
who drink and drive!

1677
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:52,720
(Liquor consumption
is injurious to health)

1678
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:56,720
Why so raw?

1679
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:58,560
Take that

1680
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:02,520
This was kept for prayer offering
and now we are eating it with booze

1681
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:03,400
Sir...

1682
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,080
no one seems to
come in this route

1683
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,400
Those guys that you got now...

1684
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:11,960
they would've gone further and must've
alerted everyone on their way

1685
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,920
Krishna! Arun! Don't let them escape!

1686
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,640
What's that noise?

1687
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:18,160
Looks like a plan to kill you!

1688
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,480
Remember the guy whom you
bashed up in the bike case?

1689
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,880
He is coming down with
his men and weapons

1690
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:24,160
Disloyal guys!

1691
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:27,400
What are you waiting for? Start the jeep!

1692
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,600
What are you doing over there?
Come here!

1693
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,160
Come on! Come on!

1694
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:39,000
Sir! Catch them! Don't let them escape

1695
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,640
It was them who left the
bike at the railway station

1696
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,640
Hey, don't let them escape!
Catch hold of them!

1697
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:43,400
Come on

1698
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:48,440
"A Twist happens in the story"

1699
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:51,760
How dare you mess
with the police?

1700
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,160
Sir, not me

1701
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:58,160
Sir!

1702
01:22:58,240 --> 01:22:59,880
Sir they thrashed me!

1703
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:03,440
Lift him!

1704
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,680
How dare you raise
hands on the police!?

1705
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:08,440
Beat him

1706
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,520
He looks like an chameleon
with a sprained neck

1707
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,160
Come to the station
tomorrow morning

1708
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:22,680
Then...

1709
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,200
that person who took
you out in bail

1710
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,160
- Raghavan
- Yes, Raghavan....

1711
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:29,960
- Bring him along
- Ok sir

1712
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,480
Now leave. Run!

1713
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:45,800
Get in!

1714
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:47,560
It's burning!

1715
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,280
Sir, they are refusing to come!

1716
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,640
What's your problem?

1717
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,640
Police department is your friend

1718
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:56,600
Don't be scared. Come in

1719
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,560
Come in and we'll
treat you real nice

1720
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:01,000
You! Move!

1721
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,600
Do you wanna know who they are?

1722
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:06,000
Wait, I'll explain

1723
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,640
Even though Duttu made his way to police
station with the three guys earlier...

1724
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:15,800
but all the charges on this bike are the
results of what these two have achieved

1725
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:18,600
'Adventures journey'

1726
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,920
Yeah, I know man. Sorry, I am coming

1727
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,200
Ok baby

1728
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:43,840
You're really hot

1729
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:52,720
Hey, it's too late man

1730
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:53,680
Sorry

1731
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,160
Last night I was so tired.
You know, she was really hot

1732
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,680
- Oh! Really?
- Yes, of course!

1733
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:04,400
Your bill sir

1734
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Sir, sign please

1735
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:16,000
Thank you, sir

1736
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:18,440
Your taxi is already waiting, sir

1737
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:19,600
Yeah. Thank you

1738
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,200
- Anything else, sir
- Let's go

1739
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:24,760
Hey, come on, man!

1740
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:40,320
Hello bhai, this is Shaukat here

1741
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:43,440
After delivering the stuff, will
there be a delay in cash pay?

1742
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:45,600
No, I am about to collect it

1743
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:46,960
Will deliver it in two days

1744
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:48,920
Ok

1745
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,640
Told you. Bhai dealing
will always be correct

1746
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:53,840
I know

1747
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:56,280
But it's risky if the delivery
gets delayed even by a bit

1748
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:59,040
I need some cash to give at home

1749
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:01,320
Mom has been calling me
for the past two days

1750
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:03,640
What happened?

1751
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:05,480
I am stuck in a traffic

1752
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,000
It's getting late

1753
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,880
I'm on way there

1754
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:32,040
Here you go

1755
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:33,720
I'll come with the
cash in two days

1756
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:36,480
- It's ok
- It's ok, keep the change

1757
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:38,920
- It's ok man. Take it
- Thank you, sir

1758
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,160
To OMR please

1759
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,600
Sure. Please have a seat

1760
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,120
- How much?
- 420 Rupees

1761
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:00,440
What? 420 rupees?

1762
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:03,120
Stop it you fraud! It's not like
you brought us in a flight here

1763
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:05,400
From T Nagar to here
costs only 300 rupees

1764
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:06,560
It's the usual

1765
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,240
That, if we took the Alandur route

1766
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:09,920
But I took the
Madhiya Kailas route

1767
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:10,920
Who asked you to take that route?

1768
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,320
The road's are bad elsewhere

1769
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:14,320
Just take 300 bucks. This ride
was worth only this much

1770
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:16,320
If you are so smart then you should
have fixed a price before getting in

1771
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:17,200
Here you go

1772
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,160
There is just 350 rupees in it

1773
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:22,160
- Obviously! Did you expect 3,500 rupees?
- Get lost!

1774
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:23,560
Jerks!

1775
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:27,080
These rickshaw guys are a pain in the head

1776
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:29,720
They'll keep squeezing through
the places they can't go through

1777
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,640
Many a time I had a close call

1778
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:33,280
Forget it man

1779
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:41,840
Tell me

1780
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,560
I was busy

1781
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:47,440
Where?

1782
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:52,240
Fine, I'll let you know

1783
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:55,960
Ok, shall I hang up now?

1784
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:57,600
Who was that?

1785
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,720
Sathya from the Rickshaw place

1786
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:02,160
It seems they need us to
race for them in a mud race

1787
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:03,400
He is asking if we can help

1788
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:04,640
How much will we get

1789
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:06,040
He says 30k for two people

1790
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:07,720
30k?

1791
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,640
One mishap and that won't
suffice even for our maintenance

1792
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:13,200
- Are you going?
- What do you mean?

1793
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:15,920
Going with them means
dragging trouble!

1794
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:17,240
This generation kids...

1795
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:20,920
are so updated that they take
birth with the knowledge of bikes

1796
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:23,760
Ride with them and...

1797
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,000
not just mishap...

1798
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:29,480
we won't even win the 30k!

1799
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,120
First, switch off that phone!

1800
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:33,160
Or else they'll keep
calling and trouble us

1801
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:29,800
Looks like she'll grab
everyone's attention!

1802
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,040
Dickson, check this out

1803
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,320
Why don't we get
such good stuffs?

1804
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:36,680
People are watching. Quite!

1805
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:38,840
She is losing her control!

1806
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:55,120
Check it out

1807
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:00,680
Oh God!

1808
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:03,880
If these guys catch us,
they won't spare our lives

1809
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:05,800
First, let's go from here

1810
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:07,040
Let's go somewhere else

1811
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:16,600
Whoa!

1812
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:18,840
Isn't it the same girl? Look!

1813
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:21,920
He must be a cheapskate!

1814
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:23,960
He is got her to a shopping mall!

1815
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:26,200
- Hello! I'm talking to you
- Just five minutes please

1816
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:27,880
Which one do we lift?

1817
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:28,800
Are you sure?

1818
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:30,320
How did you know?

1819
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:32,840
I'm talking about bike

1820
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,800
Oh, you meant the bike?

1821
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:42,880
Same issue every single day!

1822
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:45,640
How many shows run per day here?

1823
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:47,400
How many shows per day?

1824
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:48,760
How many shows?

1825
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,480
No shows are running here. Just leave

1826
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:52,560
- This isn't a theater
- But they said so

1827
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:53,680
Who told you?

1828
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,000
Come

1829
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:00,600
- Start the vehicle
- Hey, stop

1830
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:02,720
Catch him

1831
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:05,680
- Catch him! Catch him!
- Sir! Catch them!

1832
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,160
Looks like an awesome
ride, isn't it?

1833
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:33,760
Doesn't look bad

1834
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:36,520
Only the pull is a bit on the low side

1835
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,280
Otherwise it works well

1836
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:07,560
Hey, look at that

1837
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:08,840
- How much?
- 100

1838
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:11,520
To home? So are we

1839
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:13,960
Doesn't look so. Why
don't you hang a board?

1840
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,560
- Quiet!
- Look at her!

1841
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:16,840
She is unique

1842
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:18,360
How about wooing her?

1843
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,680
Hey, now come on

1844
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:22,440
Enough. A little more tight

1845
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:28,360
Why are you messing with it?

1846
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:29,560
It's not opening

1847
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:31,520
Take your hands off for a minute

1848
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:34,400
You! Don't pierce a hole in me!
Ouch!

1849
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:35,840
As simple as that

1850
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:42,400
Now, what if the tank doesn't lock?

1851
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:43,880
It will get locked. Wait and watch

1852
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:45,080
How about that?

1853
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:48,160
Take that helmet also. We might need it

1854
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:07,360
Thief! Thief!

1855
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:11,240
You doofus! Because of you I'm
gonna rust in a police station!

1856
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,280
- Thief! Thief!
- Look at her screaming!

1857
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:14,800
Somebody help! Somebody help!

1858
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:15,720
Thief!

1859
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,280
Aiyo! Somebody help!

1860
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:29,600
I have spoke to someone
here regarding your job

1861
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:31,040
Come here, at once

1862
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:37,960
We can discuss that
over here, Krishna

1863
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:39,640
Get ready and come
here immediately

1864
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:46,120
Listen, take a
rickshaw and come soon

1865
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:48,080
He'll be here only for few hours

1866
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:24,440
My bag! My jewels!

1867
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:25,840
Thief! Catch them!

1868
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:27,120
Go! Go! Don't stop!

1869
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:30,560
Security catch them!

1870
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:36,240
Aiyo! My bag! I have
my jewels in it

1871
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:39,040
Somebody catch them! Catch them!

1872
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:46,960
"A Twist happens in the story"

1873
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:05,920
Stop driving your rickshaw
like it's a bulldozer!

1874
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,480
- Why do you always take the wrong route?
- Guys! Why are you torturing me!?

1875
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:10,000
Thank God! It was a close call!

1876
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:25,960
Rascals! What do you
think about yourselves?

1877
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,920
- You idiot! Fool! Swine!
- Keep going

1878
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:29,000
Pay for the token!

1879
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:31,680
- Listen, sorry
- I don't have change

1880
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:33,320
I don't have change

1881
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:35,680
- We'll get it when we come back
- Shut up, lady!

1882
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:36,760
Come on!

1883
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:53,000
(Liquor consumption
is injurious to health)

1884
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:34,920
I am so sorry

1885
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:36,480
- Actually...
- Get me a drink!

1886
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:40,600
Hot or cold?

1887
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:43,080
Surprise me

1888
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:45,960
I'll make you hot

1889
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:48,280
Then do it

1890
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:21,520
Hey, come on. Let's go

1891
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:25,720
Sure

1892
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:36,600
Here you go

1893
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:39,160
170 rupees

1894
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:44,680
Why you buying from this cheap place?
Aren't we going to a hotel?

1895
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:45,680
Is it good?

1896
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:47,400
Yeah

1897
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:51,920
This is tasty!

1898
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:53,240
Really?

1899
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:55,360
- Is it?
- Yeah man

1900
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:56,560
Yeah!

1901
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:58,600
It is really delicious

1902
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:00,160
Crap delicious!

1903
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:03,240
These girls do the home chores and...

1904
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:05,560
they yearn for costly food
from star hotels! Duh!

1905
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:09,760
We take you to star hotels
just because we fear raids

1906
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:12,000
Or else you don't
need a star hotel

1907
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:13,200
What?

1908
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:15,120
- What did you say?
- Nothing

1909
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:18,320
Are you blind?

1910
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,200
Didn't you get any other
car to jump in front of?

1911
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:20,960
It's bhai

1912
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:23,160
- Bhai?
- Bhai, sorry we didn't notice you

1913
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,960
I thought it was a drunkard trying
to put us in a mess for money

1914
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:27,640
Don't you recognize us?

1915
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:30,280
Are you on leave today, bhai?

1916
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:32,080
We are just returning from your shop

1917
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:34,200
If I hadn't applied brakes on time...

1918
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:36,000
- you would've been a goner
- He is observing

1919
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:37,720
Come, let's go

1920
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:39,280
Ok bhai. See you

1921
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:42,400
Who is this?

1922
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:45,240
Who is this cheap fellow?

1923
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:47,440
Why? Do you want him?

1924
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:49,880
- Ewww. No
- No

1925
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:05,520
Dickson!

1926
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:06,960
Dickson!

1927
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,160
Dickson! Open!

1928
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:09,320
What is it?

1929
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:10,920
Dude, I have an exchange offer

1930
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:12,200
How about we swap?

1931
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:13,160
Get lost

1932
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:14,560
Hey, listen to me! Listen!

1933
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:16,560
Well, thought why
to waste the offer

1934
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:18,080
Fine, let's get on with our work

1935
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:23,000
I am bit busy here

1936
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:26,120
A programme? What programme?

1937
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:30,280
Ok, we'll meet tonight

1938
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:32,840
Yeah, bye

1939
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:36,840
(smoking is injurious to health)

1940
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,600
What do you want? Parotta or Dosai?

1941
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:42,120
Dosai

1942
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:43,560
How about we buy food from here?

1943
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:45,200
- Yeah man. It's rocking
- Yeah!

1944
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:46,320
To hell with your 'rocking!'

1945
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:49,640
When they got no money, they'll
just eat anything we feed them!

1946
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:52,360
Make it fast!

1947
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:03,120
Bhai, how was the programme? Awesome?

1948
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:04,200
I saw you there, bhai

1949
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:06,760
Where are your friends?
Did they leave?

1950
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:07,720
They are over there

1951
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:09,640
Oh. Ok. Ok. Carry on

1952
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:11,240
4 parottas....

1953
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:12,520
4 chappathis...

1954
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:14,920
Hey, are you really a bike rider?

1955
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:15,600
Yeah

1956
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:17,160
Oh

1957
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:19,280
Then why didn't you ride today?

1958
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:21,520
Then who will ride you?

1959
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:23,720
- What?
- Hey, nothing

1960
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:25,480
The prize money is too low

1961
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:28,920
It's a shame just to take part in
the competition for 50,000 bucks

1962
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:34,840
Hey!

1963
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:37,200
We are wandering looking for you
and you are have a nice time?

1964
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:39,560
Go, check what's the issue.
It'll bow up if police turns up

1965
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:40,680
You rascal!

1966
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:42,360
I don't get you

1967
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:45,640
Hello boss! Why are you hitting him?

1968
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:46,880
It's him! Hit him!

1969
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:48,160
They are from rich families!
Leave them!

1970
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:49,920
I don't care who they are!

1971
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,240
It was them! They left the
bike at the railway station!

1972
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:04,080
Hey, don't let them escape!
Catch hold of them!

1973
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:14,960
Hello

1974
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,320
- Krishna?
- Who's this?

1975
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:18,480
I am waiting near the hotel you said

1976
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:20,880
- Sir...
- I have got the phone

1977
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:23,360
Sorry sir, I am at
the police station

1978
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,600
I am here for a compromise

1979
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:29,200
Sir, I called you but
it was switched off

1980
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:30,840
Sir, please don't mistake me...

1981
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:33,320
can you wait there till I come?

1982
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:35,760
Which police station? I'll come there

1983
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:36,440
Here?

1984
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:38,360
It's ok. Tell me, I'll come

1985
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:39,880
Sir, Mylapore police station

1986
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:42,360
Sir, call me once you arrive,
I'll come out

1987
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:43,000
 Ok

1988
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:45,640
- What happened?
- No idea

1989
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:48,760
He is at Muniyadi vilas.
He's got the phone

1990
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:51,040
- He called because he didn't find me
- Now, what?

1991
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:52,200
Should we go there now?

1992
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:53,720
No, he said he'll come here

1993
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:54,800
Is it?

1994
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:56,000
Looks like a decent fellow

1995
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:58,760
He is decent, but it's the lady
that came with him who was a witch!

1996
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,720
If I catch hold of her....

1997
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:02,760
- There they are
- The bike case?

1998
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:07,520
What are you doing over there? You
can check it later. Come in, first

1999
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:11,160
Now, we are going to witness the
last dispute related to Duttu

2000
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:15,360
In order to understand this, you must
know about Duttu's another journey

2001
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:20,080
Though this journey isn't as spicy
and racy as the earlier ones...

2002
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:23,560
still this journey is also a
reason for Duttu ending up here

2003
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:28,840
'Journey for Love'

2004
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:40,720
Hello Rita...

2005
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:43,920
Today I am not free actually.
How about some other day?

2006
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:45,880
I really came to see you Deepak

2007
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:47,480
If you can't understand that...

2008
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:49,680
it's ok. Just leave it

2009
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:53,000
Rita, hope you understand. How
can I avoid my work and come?

2010
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:56,000
Don't say that Deepak.
You know my situation

2011
01:43:56,040 --> 01:43:58,480
I have overcome all
that just to meet you

2012
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:00,680
Well, if you don't like it, ok...

2013
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:03,640
Ok! Cool. Cool. I'll manage

2014
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:06,720
But my bike is at the service station
and I'll get it only in the evening

2015
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:09,800
No. No. No bike. Get a car

2016
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:12,360
That would be more comfortable

2017
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:13,320
Ok then

2018
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:16,320
- Then, I'll be there
- Ok darling. Bye

2019
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:25,920
Hello. Hi

2020
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:28,800
I am stuck in traffic

2021
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:31,560
No. No. I'm on my way there

2022
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:33,200
So, where are you?

2023
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:37,080
Ok, wait outside the station.
I'll come pick you up

2024
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:40,360
Ok. Ok. Bye

2025
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:43,960
There! Signal is green

2026
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:46,360
Quick Mustafa! I'm already late. Quick!

2027
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,640
- Drive!
- Ok! Ok!

2028
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:51,240
Ok. Ok. I'll call you

2029
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,640
None of our guys
have a car to rent

2030
01:44:55,680 --> 01:44:57,320
Everything is out,
booked for rides

2031
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:59,680
What do we do now? He
had high hopes from us

2032
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:02,320
I can rent you a bike for now

2033
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:06,280
- Does that sound good?
- I don't have anything else at this hour

2034
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:08,760
Or else hire a cab

2035
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:11,320
What?

2036
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:13,160
Give me a minute

2037
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:17,240
He is taking his lover, right?

2038
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:18,520
I hope nothing fishy

2039
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:21,720
No way. He is a good friend

2040
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,840
You can't trust anyone these days

2041
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:28,840
Bike sounds good

2042
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:30,280
Ok?

2043
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:31,840
Chief, he is fine with the bike

2044
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:35,000
Wait, I'll go get the bike key

2045
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:36,040
Ok

2046
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:44,680
I have to go to Salem, it's urgent
or else I would've given my car

2047
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:47,520
Here, its the original RC book.
I don't have the photocopy

2048
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:49,400
Just one day right. Keep it safe

2049
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:51,160
Wait, I'll get the bike

2050
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:53,400
Buddy, careful with the RC book

2051
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:06,560
There is an ignition issue in this bike

2052
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:08,360
Any key will work on this bike

2053
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:10,120
- So, be careful
- Ok buddy

2054
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:21,400
Hello Rita. I have reached

2055
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:22,560
I'm waiting outside

2056
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,080
Where are you?

2057
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:27,840
Hi Rita! Turn left!

2058
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:30,960
Hi

2059
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,880
Wow! Is she going to sit on me?

2060
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:35,320
Nice figure!

2061
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:37,480
Is this the bike?

2062
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:39,280
Shall we?

2063
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:41,400
No helmet for me?

2064
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:44,160
- Why does the pillion rider need helmet?
- Just for precaution

2065
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:46,360
Why would you need precaution
when you're with me?

2066
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:49,720
Awesome!

2067
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:52,160
- Shall we?
- Yep!

2068
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,800
Look at her bending

2069
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:04,240
- Dickson, check that out
- Hey, come on

2070
01:47:04,280 --> 01:47:07,080
- Wonder why we don't get such girls
- Rita, people are watching

2071
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:09,360
Public's watching us. Quiet

2072
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:12,560
What's going on? Why are
you behaving like this?

2073
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:13,880
What's there to be afraid off?

2074
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:19,360
Calm down. The signal will
turn green any moment

2075
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:20,640
Hands off me

2076
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:29,760
For how much, sir?

2077
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:30,880
100 rupees

2078
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:38,840
- I said, people are watching
- So what?

2079
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:41,560
Won't you obey me?

2080
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:45,360
Here, keep this
in your bag first

2081
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:47,080
Careful, it's this
bike's original document

2082
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:47,920
Is it?

2083
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:54,600
- They are looking at us
- So what?

2084
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:59,760
- How much?
- 200 rupees

2085
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:05,440
Thank God, their love fire
didn't burn up the fuel station

2086
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:06,480
Indeed!

2087
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:11,560
"Filled up in my heart"

2088
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:19,880
"My heart is filled up with your love"

2089
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:26,760
"Shall I come along?"

2090
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:35,200
"Shall I come along?"

2091
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:47,400
Sir! Sir! Sir!

2092
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:49,800
Sir, please park in the parking lot.
Not here

2093
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:50,840
Just five minutes

2094
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:52,560
Please, don't park here. Listen to me

2095
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:53,360
Wait, I'm coming

2096
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:55,600
Excuse me! I'm talking to you!

2097
01:48:55,640 --> 01:48:58,360
- We'll be back in five minutes
- Park in the parking section! Not here!

2098
01:48:58,440 --> 01:48:59,960
- It's not allowed
- Just for five minutes

2099
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,240
Sir! Oh come on!

2100
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:05,040
Sir, why can't you
just follow the rules?

2101
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:08,000
So, what plans after shopping?

2102
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:10,960
Why are you asking me? You tell me

2103
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,440
Sir!

2104
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:14,200
Where shall we go?

2105
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:16,720
Sir! Sir!

2106
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:19,480
- Someone just stole your bike
- What?

2107
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:21,880
Sir, isn't that yellow bike
at the entrance yours?

2108
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:24,040
Two guys just stole it. Quick, come on

2109
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:26,680
How did you get hurt?
How did they steal it?

2110
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:28,760
- Need some water?
- You!

2111
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:31,680
- Where's the bike?
- Some two guys stole it

2112
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:34,120
What the hell were you doing?

2113
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:36,280
Excuse me, what can he do?

2114
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:38,400
They man handled him
and took the bike!

2115
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:40,360
We've informed the police.
Let's wait for them

2116
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:42,640
Police? Isn't this
their responsibility?

2117
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:45,680
And that is why we asked you
to park at the parking lot!

2118
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:48,640
You park as you wish and how do you
expect us to take responsibility?

2119
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:51,640
Whose bike?

2120
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:53,880
It was his

2121
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:56,640
What's the model?

2122
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:58,280
Yamaha RX135

2123
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:00,520
Vehicle number?

2124
01:50:01,160 --> 01:50:04,040
TN 02 H 4937

2125
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,480
- Color?
- Yellow

2126
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:09,960
Security, call for a rickshaw

2127
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:11,200
Ok sir

2128
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:14,280
Fine, please do file a
case in the local station

2129
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:15,960
I'll inform the control
room right away

2130
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:19,480
Plaza corner, reporting sir.
A bike missing, sir!

2131
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:21,840
TN 02 H 4937

2132
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:23,920
Not the police station, please!

2133
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:25,080
Wait, we'll decide that

2134
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:27,160
Sir...

2135
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:29,160
is it a must to file a
case at the station?

2136
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:30,640
Haven't you already
informed them?

2137
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:34,680
Only if lodge a complaint,
legal actions will be taken

2138
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:38,200
Not just that, many bikes
are getting stolen of late

2139
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:40,560
So, go lodge a complaint first

2140
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:42,240
Rickshaw is here

2141
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:43,680
Carry on

2142
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:45,680
The station is quite close by

2143
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:51,840
Hello

2144
01:50:51,880 --> 01:50:53,000
Where are you, Mustafa?

2145
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:53,880
Tell me, buddy

2146
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:55,520
I'm at Alwarpet. What is it?

2147
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:58,920
Buddy, well...a small
issue has come up

2148
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:00,640
Someone stole the bike

2149
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:01,600
When?

2150
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:03,120
From where?

2151
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:07,800
Then?

2152
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:11,720
Myself and Rita just stepped out of the
police station after lodging a complaint

2153
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:12,880
Which station?

2154
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:15,480
I'll be there at once

2155
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:20,200
I can't understand Deepak!

2156
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:22,200
Why are you hiding like this?

2157
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:25,760
Aiyo Rita, I have never
faced such a situation

2158
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,120
First time in my life. I'm scared if
Shaji goes to my office in search of me

2159
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:32,000
I took an off claiming that I am sick

2160
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:36,120
Just two days, Rita. We'll
get a good solution by then

2161
01:51:36,240 --> 01:51:37,760
Please try to understand

2162
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:39,160
So, should I go now?

2163
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,080
That's what you want?

2164
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:44,520
I'll call you back, Rita

2165
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:46,320
You liar!

2166
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:48,760
You haven't been
calling me of late

2167
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:51,000
All our plans got doomed

2168
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:55,480
Go shopping now. I'll help you out

2169
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:59,520
I'm not here to go shopping, Deepak.
I don't want anything

2170
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:02,720
I just want you

2171
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:09,400
- Sorry! Sorry!
- Hey! How dare you?

2172
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:11,360
What's the problem over there?

2173
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:12,120
Madam!

2174
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:14,160
- Sorry madam
- What happened, madam?

2175
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:16,560
- Who is this fellow?
- An employee here

2176
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:18,880
Do you have such dirty
people working for you?

2177
01:52:18,920 --> 01:52:20,920
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything

2178
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:22,680
I just went in to take
their order and...

2179
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:25,000
Can't you knock the door
when you come inside?

2180
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:27,360
You people don't have manners at all!

2181
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:29,240
Why didn't you knock the door?

2182
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:30,920
I thought, why to disturb them and hence...

2183
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:32,320
What happened?

2184
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:34,280
- He recorded us
- He recorded you guys?

2185
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:36,720
He can record her but
why did you record her?

2186
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:38,760
You thought the door is
locked and so let's shoot?

2187
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:41,240
I didn't record anything.
I promise, madam

2188
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:42,840
You did! I saw it!

2189
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,560
Then call the police, madam

2190
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:47,000
I beg of you. Please quiet down

2191
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:48,960
- Please calm down
- No need of police. I'll manage it

2192
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,640
I want to check your phone. Give it to me

2193
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:52,120
I didn't record you guys, madam

2194
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:52,920
Give your phone!

2195
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:54,160
No madam. I didn't shoot anything

2196
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:56,360
You didn't shoot right?
Then why are you afraid?

2197
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:57,840
Let her check. She'll then return it

2198
01:52:57,880 --> 01:53:00,440
Give me the phone! Here madam.
Check it

2199
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:01,280
Come

2200
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:05,040
I'll check it. If it's clear, I'll give it
back or else collect it from the police!

2201
01:53:05,120 --> 01:53:07,160
Didn't you understand what she said?

2202
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:12,840
"A Twist happens in the story"

2203
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:17,040
Madam, phone! Madam
please return the phone!

2204
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:21,040
"A Twist happens in the story"

2205
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:29,120
Why did you snatch his phone?

2206
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:31,440
You could've checked
it right there, no?

2207
01:53:31,480 --> 01:53:33,160
It'll create problems, Rita!

2208
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:34,720
Why don't you get it?

2209
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:36,320
I don't need his phone!

2210
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:39,600
I'll check it and give it to you.
You hand it over to him

2211
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:41,640
No, thanks. You
handle it yourself

2212
01:53:41,680 --> 01:53:43,280
I have enough problems already

2213
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:46,080
Ok then, I'll manage

2214
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:48,240
Let him wander
desperately until then

2215
01:53:59,120 --> 01:54:00,200
Sorry

2216
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:02,040
Hope you understand my situation.
Right?

2217
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:06,560
Bye, take care

2218
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:08,560
Sorry dear. I didn't
expect this to happen

2219
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:09,840
- Bye
- Bye, see you

2220
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:10,920
Shall we?

2221
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:11,920
I'll call you then

2222
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:27,840
What do we tell Shaji?

2223
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:31,480
Tell him, I need the
bike for two more days

2224
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:32,600
Here, have it

2225
01:54:33,040 --> 01:54:33,800
Have it

2226
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:38,160
Nothing will happen. I'll
take care of everything. Ok?

2227
01:54:39,680 --> 01:54:40,480
See you

2228
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:47,360
Nothing good will come out
if you keep hiding like this

2229
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:50,280
What you did was crazy!

2230
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,920
Who rents a bike when going
out with his girlfriend?

2231
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:56,560
You could've asked me. I
would've arranged a car

2232
01:54:57,640 --> 01:54:59,480
It's been a week since you are hiding here

2233
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:02,240
Turn on that phone and
see what's the situation

2234
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:04,760
Or else it'll blow out of proportion!

2235
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:07,320
Even I have had
girlfriends...

2236
01:55:07,680 --> 01:55:09,720
What if someone
wants to come home?

2237
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,360
I should say 'Sorry'...

2238
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:12,520
to you

2239
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:23,280
Dude!

2240
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:25,200
Message from Rita

2241
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:26,840
So many calls?

2242
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:28,960
Oh my god!

2243
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,840
Two missed calls
from my madam also

2244
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:34,800
I have got call from the police station
where I lodged the missing bike complaint

2245
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:37,400
Call them back. There
might be some progress

2246
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:40,360
I'm sure they would've
called your office

2247
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:41,640
Which is why your
madam has called you

2248
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:43,200
I have only given this number

2249
01:55:43,240 --> 01:55:45,960
I have provided them with my native
address and not the local one

2250
01:55:47,320 --> 01:55:48,160
Hello

2251
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:50,480
East police station?

2252
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:51,760
Yes and you are?

2253
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,800
Sir, it's me, Deepak. I had lodged
a missing bike complaint last week

2254
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:56,960
What's bike model?

2255
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:01,360
Sir, Yamaha RX135. TN 02 H 4937

2256
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:02,600
Color?

2257
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:03,800
Yellow

2258
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:06,080
Where did you go missing
after lodging a complaint?

2259
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:07,160
How many times
should we call you?

2260
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:09,120
It's not just enough to
lodge a complaint...

2261
01:56:09,160 --> 01:56:11,400
You must call and follow it up

2262
01:56:11,440 --> 01:56:12,840
- Sir... well..
- Stop it now

2263
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:15,720
If you don't want the bike, then
it'll rust in the police station

2264
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:17,120
We don't have a problem with that

2265
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:20,200
Sir! Sir! Sorry sir!

2266
01:56:20,240 --> 01:56:23,280
- I was out of station
- Whatever man!

2267
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:27,280
Fine, the bike is at
Mylapore police station

2268
01:56:27,320 --> 01:56:27,800
Ok sir

2269
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:31,200
Get the original documents. We can go
cross verify it and retrieve the bike

2270
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:33,280
Ok sir. Ok sir. Thank you

2271
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:40,200
The bike is at Mylapore police station but
they want me to bring the original documents

2272
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:42,080
Rita has those documents

2273
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:43,920
I forgot to collect it
back in that chaos

2274
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:46,640
Leave it, man. Say you lost it

2275
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:48,520
What will I tell Shaji?

2276
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:51,560
Then call Rita. Explain
her and she'll understand

2277
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:55,480
Don't think too much

2278
01:56:56,160 --> 01:56:59,760
This is important. Call
her and go to the station

2279
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:04,480
Today bhai. Only
today we got to know

2280
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:06,040
Bhai, I'll call you later

2281
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:07,760
Ok bhai

2282
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:10,520
You!

2283
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:12,720
If the bike has any damage...

2284
01:57:13,480 --> 01:57:14,880
then wait and watch

2285
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:21,600
If I catch hold of her, I'll...

2286
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:25,680
That 'bike' case?

2287
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:30,000
- Wait here. I'll go check inside
- Ok, I'll wait here

2288
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:34,000
What are you doing over there? You
can check it later. Come in, first

2289
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:41,880
Greetings sir. I am coming
from the east police station

2290
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:45,120
This is the case file
of that missing bike

2291
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:48,240
Why is he here?

2292
01:57:49,120 --> 01:57:49,960
So you know him?

2293
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,560
The woman who took my mobile...

2294
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:53,200
he was the one with
her at that time

2295
01:57:53,480 --> 01:57:54,520
Is that him?

2296
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:56,400
He said he'll call me from outside

2297
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:58,920
What's with secret tone?

2298
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:00,240
Sir, this is another case

2299
01:58:00,280 --> 01:58:01,040
Damn it!

2300
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:02,200
Another case!

2301
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:07,080
Who lodged the complaint?

2302
01:58:07,120 --> 01:58:08,760
Sir, it was him

2303
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:12,480
Then who is he?

2304
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:15,720
Sir, the missing
bike belongs to me

2305
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:19,280
Why did you lodge a complaint
for his missing bike?

2306
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:20,160
Sir!

2307
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:22,080
These guys are jobless, I think!

2308
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:25,000
He borrowed the
bike from him, sir

2309
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:29,480
You look educated. Why would you
borrow bike from some doofus?

2310
01:58:29,600 --> 01:58:31,400
Sir, I hired it for rent

2311
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:32,360
Yeah right!

2312
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:36,080
Hired bikes are quite useful
to commit crimes. Isn't it?

2313
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:38,960
Go, get those fellows

2314
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:40,880
To hell with him
and his neck band!

2315
01:58:40,920 --> 01:58:43,920
You! Get those two criminals!

2316
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:45,840
Come on!

2317
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:47,480
His head injury...

2318
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:49,240
Robbing your jewellery...

2319
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:52,320
These guys have agreed to
have committed the crimes

2320
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:54,720
But the problem is that...

2321
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:56,960
they sold the stuff and
spent all the money

2322
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:01,160
They will give the full details about where
they sold it. We have bashed them enough!

2323
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:03,080
There they are, fools!

2324
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:08,920
Go, stand there! To hell
with their looks and inners!

2325
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:10,800
What's the use of stealing so much?

2326
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:14,160
Can't you guys buy a brand
new inners and wear them?

2327
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:15,040
It stinks!

2328
01:59:15,120 --> 01:59:16,240
Head constable...

2329
01:59:16,680 --> 01:59:18,400
you don't know the youth
fashion these days

2330
01:59:18,440 --> 01:59:21,760
Today's youth wear
only torn stuffs

2331
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:24,760
Do they look like they care?

2332
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:26,840
What do you say?

2333
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:28,800
How dare you laugh?!

2334
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:31,640
So, madam...

2335
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:34,240
Have a good look and tell us...

2336
01:59:35,480 --> 01:59:36,320
Was it them?

2337
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:42,120
Since they were wearing helmet...

2338
01:59:42,240 --> 01:59:45,680
I doubt if it was these two guys

2339
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:47,200
You fool!

2340
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:50,600
I told you to get them with the helmet
on and you go them with the inners!

2341
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:06,560
If you keep saying stories like they were
wearing helmet and you can't recognize...

2342
02:00:06,680 --> 02:00:08,640
then the case will be
dismissed in the court

2343
02:00:08,720 --> 02:00:09,440
Sir!

2344
02:00:09,560 --> 02:00:11,360
So, what I am suggesting is...

2345
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:14,840
tell us whatever you know
and that too clearly

2346
02:00:15,120 --> 02:00:16,040
Got it?

2347
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:19,800
Sir, a lady is here with the documents

2348
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:21,120
Ask her to come in

2349
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:22,840
Come in

2350
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:24,280
Why so late?

2351
02:00:27,080 --> 02:00:27,720
Sir...

2352
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:30,520
this lady was there with him,
when he lodged the complaint

2353
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:31,320
How come he is here?

2354
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:33,040
Witch! She is there
everywhere I go!

2355
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:35,680
Dude...

2356
02:00:35,720 --> 02:00:37,000
she is really hot. Isn't she?

2357
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:41,120
Doofus! She is the one who snatched
away Salim bhai's mobile from me

2358
02:00:41,160 --> 02:00:42,200
Is that her?

2359
02:00:42,680 --> 02:00:46,320
I wanted to abuse her but drats,
we are at the wrong place

2360
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:47,480
She is the one who
snatched the phone

2361
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:48,760
- Head constable!
- Sir?

2362
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:51,160
Check it and settle this.
Carry on

2363
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:53,760
Ok sir

2364
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:55,440
- Head constable
- Sir?

2365
02:00:55,600 --> 02:00:57,520
While pressing charges
on the charge sheet...

2366
02:00:57,560 --> 02:01:00,440
take all the unsolved
bikes cases and...

2367
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:02,320
- put it on them!
- Ok sir

2368
02:01:03,080 --> 02:01:07,040
These 'inner wear' boys must never
set foot out of prison for life!

2369
02:01:07,080 --> 02:01:08,320
- Got it?
- Sir...

2370
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:10,560
No matter what we do...

2371
02:01:10,640 --> 02:01:15,560
there will be many dinkus out
there to bail out such doofuses!

2372
02:01:15,600 --> 02:01:19,280
They will come, deal it smoothly
and take these guys away

2373
02:01:24,440 --> 02:01:25,480
Listen you guys!

2374
02:01:26,640 --> 02:01:28,920
Like how you confessed here...

2375
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:33,080
you must confess in court
the exact same way

2376
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:37,400
Got it? If you screw it up....

2377
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:40,520
you guys won't have
knees to kneel down

2378
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:42,480
It's chief Vasu.
Ask them the phone

2379
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:44,280
First let this get settled

2380
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:47,400
After going out, I'll get the phone
from here and the see what I do to her

2381
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:48,160
Hey!

2382
02:01:48,480 --> 02:01:50,480
What's with the
secret tone again?

2383
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:52,480
Sir, like I said, this is another case

2384
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:54,120
What's that case? Tell me!

2385
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:56,600
Keep saying that simply
and I'll file you

2386
02:01:56,640 --> 02:01:59,840
under a case and sent
you to prison for life!

2387
02:01:59,880 --> 02:02:00,680
Sir...

2388
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:02,240
well nothing...

2389
02:02:02,320 --> 02:02:06,200
this lady took his mobile under a
small misunderstanding circumstances

2390
02:02:06,240 --> 02:02:08,160
The mobile is the root
cause of all these issues

2391
02:02:08,240 --> 02:02:10,080
If we can get back that mobile then...

2392
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:13,520
If we don't get the mobile,
it'll become a serious issue

2393
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:19,360
Listen lady...

2394
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:22,320
if you have his mobile, why
don't you just return it?

2395
02:02:22,360 --> 02:02:25,040
Don't you have enough people
to buy you mobile phones?

2396
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:34,160
Sorry sir, I lost that mobile

2397
02:02:34,200 --> 02:02:37,160
What the hell? If I don't
get that mobile...

2398
02:02:37,560 --> 02:02:39,120
What happened? Calm down

2399
02:02:39,240 --> 02:02:41,120
Sir, she has the mobile!

2400
02:02:41,160 --> 02:02:43,800
He just called me few minutes
ago saying he'll get the mobile

2401
02:02:44,160 --> 02:02:46,480
Hello! I called you? I didn't call you

2402
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:48,920
Sir, I didn't call anyone

2403
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:52,360
No sir. What I said is true

2404
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:53,560
I have lost the phone

2405
02:03:01,960 --> 02:03:03,160
Accent? Huh!

2406
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:05,320
Where did you miss the phone?

2407
02:03:07,240 --> 02:03:08,280
Sorry...

2408
02:03:08,320 --> 02:03:09,640
Who is Krishna here?

2409
02:03:10,760 --> 02:03:11,560
It's me

2410
02:03:13,960 --> 02:03:15,800
Isn't this the phone you were looking for?

2411
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:17,640
- That's the one
- How did you get it?

2412
02:03:17,680 --> 02:03:20,520
Don't you feel ashamed to invade
others privacy and shoot them?

2413
02:03:20,600 --> 02:03:22,240
Sir, I didn't do any such thing

2414
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:24,240
What's going on?

2415
02:03:24,600 --> 02:03:26,440
Don't you settle
disputes when I am here!

2416
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:28,000
Who took away your phone?

2417
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:28,880
It was that lady

2418
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:29,920
What's with that tone?

2419
02:03:30,120 --> 02:03:31,400
It was that madam

2420
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:33,200
Why did she snatch it from you?

2421
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:37,680
She misunderstood that I recorded them
when they were intimate at the hotel

2422
02:03:37,720 --> 02:03:39,960
Ah...Ok! Ok! I get it

2423
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:44,840
So, you recorded them when they
were romancing in the hotel

2424
02:03:44,880 --> 02:03:45,600
No sir

2425
02:03:45,640 --> 02:03:47,040
And so she snatched
it away from you

2426
02:03:47,080 --> 02:03:50,800
Then he delivers the phone that
she snatched it away from you

2427
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:52,680
How did he get the phone?

2428
02:03:52,840 --> 02:03:53,600
Same doubt

2429
02:03:54,720 --> 02:03:55,600
Thank you...

2430
02:03:56,040 --> 02:03:57,160
for saving my life

2431
02:03:57,200 --> 02:03:58,120
Thank you, sir

2432
02:04:00,440 --> 02:04:01,440
Excuse me

2433
02:04:05,320 --> 02:04:06,200
What's going on?

2434
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:09,440
How dare you slap her in front of me
and that too in my police station?

2435
02:04:09,480 --> 02:04:10,640
Who are you?

2436
02:04:13,480 --> 02:04:15,240
She is my wife

2437
02:04:16,200 --> 02:04:17,280
- Wife?
- Sorry!

2438
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:19,280
Was my wife!

2439
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:34,360
Woman like this are
different cases

2440
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:36,080
Not within our limits

2441
02:04:36,120 --> 02:04:38,360
All she deserves is
one tight slap!

2442
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:40,720
Get lost!

2443
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:42,520
What are you looking at?

2444
02:04:42,840 --> 02:04:43,640
Get lost!

2445
02:04:54,840 --> 02:04:55,720
Mahesh!

2446
02:04:56,920 --> 02:04:58,080
Mahesh!

2447
02:04:59,120 --> 02:05:02,400
All the cases linked to
Duttu comes to an end here

2448
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:07,120
At the same time, all of them
continue their life's journey

2449
02:05:07,480 --> 02:05:10,760
Rita's life could end in divorce

2450
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:12,320
Or else...

2451
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:15,560
Mahesh can forget everything
and take her back

2452
02:05:22,840 --> 02:05:25,400
Well, he has a
Geetha if not Rita

2453
02:05:25,640 --> 02:05:27,680
If not Duttu then some other bike

2454
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:29,800
But no matter what...

2455
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:33,080
he always has a girl
riding with him

2456
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:41,000
After this, these guys are
presented in court and sentenced

2457
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:44,040
They will learn their
lesson and change for good

2458
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:47,120
If that's what you thought...

2459
02:05:47,160 --> 02:05:48,480
then that's a blunder!

2460
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:55,640
Though they stole for a good reason...

2461
02:05:55,680 --> 02:05:58,920
There is noting good about stealing.
Stealing is stealing!

2462
02:05:59,200 --> 02:06:03,480
After this, he got an exact same
phone that created all this mess...

2463
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:07,400
he is paying for it in installments and he
works at a proper job, like a responsible man

2464
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:14,160
After this case, Arun become more strict
in his job and committed no blunders

2465
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:18,480
Rafique? Still continues to work in the
same food van to spend on girlfriends

2466
02:06:18,680 --> 02:06:20,920
Somasundaram is quite happy

2467
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:24,080
Because he has never closed any
case properly during his service

2468
02:06:24,680 --> 02:06:26,440
See you, sir. I got it

2469
02:06:26,840 --> 02:06:28,040
- Listen...
- Sir?

2470
02:06:28,480 --> 02:06:30,440
At least hereafter when
you rent out the bike...

2471
02:06:30,480 --> 02:06:32,120
- be careful. Got it?
- Ok sir

2472
02:06:32,320 --> 02:06:35,360
Or else you'll reduce weight running
back and forth to the police station

2473
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:42,320
Duttu's journey from here...

2474
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:45,600
is with this handsome hunk!

2475
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:48,920
Because he is the real
owner of this bike

2476
02:06:51,800 --> 02:06:54,240
I don't think I'll have to
bear this fatso for long

2477
02:06:54,280 --> 02:06:58,480
I am very sure that soon someone
will turn up to steal me again

2478
02:06:58,520 --> 02:07:01,240
I don't care who it is

2479
02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:03,560
But he must have a
girlfriend like this one!

2480
02:07:04,080 --> 02:07:05,480
That's all I wish for!
