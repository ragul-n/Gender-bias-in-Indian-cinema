1
00:01:36,376 --> 00:01:41,376
I feel protective with him just like I felt safe with you

2
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,700
It feels as if he is there for my protection

3
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,024
Agha Jaan...

4
00:01:58,748 --> 00:02:02,148
I still have that dream, it's like it has been following me

5
00:02:05,172 --> 00:02:07,172
It doesn't leave me

6
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:16,096
Today neither you are with me, nor he whom I accepted whole heartedly

7
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,220
He is far away from me even being physically around me

8
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,744
He is my own but doesn't feel like my own

9
00:02:27,768 --> 00:02:30,468
Today to whom should I got after feeling scared of that dream?

10
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:35,492
On whose shoulder should I cry?

11
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:40,516
To whom should I tell that this dream scares me

12
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,640
Please save me from it

13
00:02:50,164 --> 00:02:51,564
Call me to you

14
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,780
I have been trying to contact you for so long, Buwa Ji.

15
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,940
I have made so many calls to you.

16
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,180
Some of the times it is a servant and sometimes it is Ali Bakhsh who is on the phone.

17
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,140
And do you know what he does? He immediately cuts the call.

18
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,860
He doesn’t even give me a chance to ask anything. This is ridiculous.

19
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,580
Did Ali Bakhsh give you any message from me?

20
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,220
No, Farhana Bibi. I don’t live there anymore.

21
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,140
What do you mean? Where were you?

22
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:41,060
I left Sahab’s house and went to Sukkur after Anna’s wedding. I am living there now.

23
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,220
But why is that, Buwa Ji? You are one of the oldest family maids in Farooque Bhai’s household.

24
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,940
In fact, no one even refers to you as a maid or servant.

25
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:57,860
Yes, Farhana Bibi. I just didn’t feel like staying in that house after Anna got married.

26
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,660
When Anna was there, it was cheerful and bright,

27
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,020
my heart felt content and it kept me busy with work.

28
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,940
There was nothing left to do there after Anna left.

29
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,499
Please drop me off at Sahab’s house.

30
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,700
At Farooque Bhai’s house?

31
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:29,660
Yes, I have something important to discuss with him. It is essential that I meet him.

32
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,300
What is the matter, Buwa Ji? You look somewhat troubled.

33
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,900
No, I’m not troubled. It could just be tiredness due to my journey.

34
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,820
Buwa Ji, you may go to Farooque Bhai later on.

35
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,500
Please spend a little time with me. I have found you with great difficulty.

36
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,940
There’s a lot of stuff I want to discuss with you.

37
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,220
If you go there now then that devious Ali Bakhsh

38
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,980
will make sure that we don’t stay connected again. Please, Buwa Ji.

39
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,100
Why would he do such a thing? It’s nothing of the sort.

40
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:11,060
It is like that, Buwa Ji. And now I am positive that all of this is Farooque Bhai’s doing.

41
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,300
He does not want me to have any sort of connection with either Anna or you.

42
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,580
I am sure he has said something to Anna so that she is now angry with me.

43
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:27,180
Buwa Ji, it is very important for me to talk to you right now. Please…

44
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,140
Bhai, please take the car towards the hotel.

45
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:38,700
Are you going to stay at a hotel not at Farooque Sahab’s?

46
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,420
No. If I could only find Anna then I would have stayed with her.

47
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,740
But since I did not find Anna, I will stay at a hotel.

48
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,660
And I don’t want Farooque Bhai to even get a whiff of the fact that I am in Pakistan.

49
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,860
If he was to ever find out then the first thing he would do is to sever the connection between you and me.

50
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,860
I will not let it happen this time around.

51
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,660
Have I come so far away from America just to become a target of Farooque Bhai’s schemes?

52
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,420
I won’t be able to find out anything about what’s true,

53
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,900
nor meet Anna or be connected to you and return to America just like that.

54
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,300
Buwa Ji, please….

55
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,780
Let’s go away from here.

56
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,580
Where?

57
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,100
To Islamabad.

58
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,980
I’ll leave you with your dear Agha Jaan.

59
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,980
But you wanted to take revenge from me…

60
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,860
Not from you, from your father.

61
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:23,300
Yes, I did bring you here so as to take revenge from your father,

62
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:34,740
but…. I cannot see you in this state anymore.

63
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:46,340
No matter how many times I belie myself that this just cannot be,

64
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,980
Anna, the truth is that I am in love with you.

65
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:03,820
the kind of love where it hurts when you shed a tear and I cannot see you in pain

66
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:08,180
I cannot see you in tears. I begin to hate my own self.

67
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,780
I feel like killing myself!

68
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:18,700
Of all the people I could have fallen in love with in the entire world, it had to be the daughter of my enemy?

69
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:26,580
The one who murdered my mother, my father and my sister.

70
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:34,300
Being in love with you is not my will, my choice nor to my liking either,

71
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,460
however, I am helpless in this.

72
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,940
Your love has taken away all of my resolutions from me.

73
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:57,140
It was for this day that I had told you not to get married to me for your life will be ruined

74
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,900
but you did not listen to me.

75
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:10,260
So, then come along now. I’ll go and leave you with your father.

76
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:23,340
I’ll even divorce you if you say so. So, I take back all of these accusations.

77
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,980
I have not forgotten any of the words you spoke to me nor any of your accusations

78
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,660
and I will never forget them, Amaan.

79
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,980
I have sworn upon my Agha Jaan’s name

80
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,980
I will not go anywhere till the time when I bring before you the evidence of his innocence.

81
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,220
I am one who, like her father, would give her life for her honor and self-respect.

82
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,780
I will die but I will not leave without achieving my aim in coming here.

83
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,020
Come inside, Buwa Ji. Come in.

84
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:45,700
Yes, leave it right there. Alright now, get me 2 cups of tea and make sure it’s really hot.

85
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,500
Be a little quick with it, huh?

86
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,980
So, Buwa Ji. Let’s have some tea. I am tired after my long flight, you know.

87
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,660
Farhana Bibi, please allow me to leave.

88
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:02,980
It is very important that I go and meet Sahab. I really do have some important work with him.

89
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,260
Buwa Ji, I have found you with such great difficulty.

90
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,140
Don’t know whether I will ever get to meet you again or not. Please be seated.

91
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,740
Please stay with me for a little while.

92
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,660
There are a lot of things that I want to know from you.

93
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,340
However, if you go off to meet Farooque Bhai,, then you do know what will happen, right?

94
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:34,420
Just like this, with a snap of the fingers, he will have our association disconnected.

95
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,940
Buwa Ji, I have come all the way from America

96
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:42,580
to find out the true details about my sister’s death.

97
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,740
I have my suspicions

98
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,900
Neelo Baji’s death did not happen in the way we were told.

99
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,700
In fact, I’m pretty sure that there is some sort of secret mystery hidden behind my sister’s death.

100
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,460
And then you have been with them since before that. For the sake of God, Buwa Ji.

101
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,220
Atleast you can tell me now about what had happened to my sister.

102
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,780
What is the truth? How were the last days she spent, Buwa Ji?

103
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,640
Farhana Bibi, what sort of questions are you asking me?

104
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,120
There is no mystery hidden behind Begum Sahiba’s death

105
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:29,440
and what you and your family were told is the truth.

106
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,320
Alright, that’s fine, then look into my eyes and say it.

107
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,400
Buwa Ji, look into my eyes and tell me so that I can be certain

108
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,800
that right now you are telling me the truth.

109
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,400
Speak the truth now atleast, Buwa Ji.

110
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,920
Speak the truth for Anna’s sake.

111
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,880
The one for whom you have lied and have done so for so many years,

112
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,640
you are now under oath on the life of Anna.

113
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,360
Don’t give me that great an oath to take, Farhana Bibi.

114
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,920
My innocent and naïve child is already in great trouble.

115
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,840
I don’t know what state she might be in nor where she could be.

116
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,120
What do you mean by where she could be? She and Amaan are out.

117
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,560
They could probably be travelling around .

118
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,240
It is possible that he has taken her to London for he has a business over there as well.

119
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,920
What is there to be so very worried about in that, Buwa Ji?

120
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,040
You don’t know anything, Farhana Bibi.

121
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,600
You have no clue.

122
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,080
You have come here to find evidence regarding the death of your sister, right?

123
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,400
You should forget the past and be more concerned about the present.

124
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,480
Stop worrying about the one who is dead and has left this world.

125
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,360
Worry about the one who is alive.

126
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:05,440
Worry about your niece, who is probably in a lot of trouble and I don’t know where she is!

127
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,840
What are you saying, Buwa Ji? I don’t understand what you mean to say?

128
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:19,400
Speak frankly. God forbid, is Anna in some sort of trouble?

129
00:14:34,924 --> 00:14:40,124
I haven't forgotten your accustaions Amaan

130
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:48,248
I have taken oath of my Agha Jaan's life. Until I prove his innocence I will not go anywhere.

131
00:14:52,772 --> 00:14:56,272
I am one who, like her father, would give her life for her honor and self-respect.

132
00:14:58,796 --> 00:15:00,196
It's very late now

133
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,420
I will die but I will not leave without achieving my aim in coming here.

134
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:01,160
Humayun Afzal was the Director of Zamaan Group of Industries.

135
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,600
Mir Farooque Zamaan sent him off to Malaysia on pretence of some work there.

136
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,360
He purposely had drugs and other substances planted on him

137
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,880
and had him arrested in Malaysia.

138
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:21,400
My husband, Humayun Afzal was an honest and respectable man.

139
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:27,560
He died before he could prove his innocence in the matter.

140
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,000
I remained silent for all this time

141
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:38,280
because I feared for the safety of my children but I can no longer remain silent.

142
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:46,080
I have absolute proof of the fact that the drugs had been planted on Humayun.

143
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,480
Mir Farooque Zamaan had sent that consignment from Pakistan.

144
00:16:49,504 --> 00:16:51,104
Viewers we will give you a breaking news here regarding

145
00:16:51,228 --> 00:16:55,628
famous personality of Pakistan Mir Farooque Zaman

146
00:16:55,652 --> 00:16:57,852
Who is the owner of Zamaan group of industries

147
00:16:57,876 --> 00:17:05,776
Wife of a Former Director of his company has accused him of drugs smuggling

148
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:15,800
Humayun Afzal was arrested last year in Malaysia for drugs smuggling. During interrogation he died of cardiac arrest.

149
00:17:15,824 --> 00:17:25,624
His wife alongwith his two children who now lives in London has said in a video message on social media that Mir Farooque Zamaan is responsible for it

150
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:30,648
If these accusations are proved true then they can bring problems for him

151
00:17:30,672 --> 00:17:34,872
We are trying to contact him so that we can take his word on it too

152
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:44,760
Sahib…. Sahib, I think there’s a call from the TV Channel. What is to be done?

153
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,600
Let them call. I will give my statement later.

154
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,520
Where did this new curse come from?

155
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,680
Where did this Humayun Afzal’s wife suddenly appear from digging up old skeletons?

156
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:04,440
At the moment my enemy is only one person who is after my ruin.

157
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,400
At first I had only suspected but now I am certain.

158
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,080
Amaanullah is behind this as well.

159
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,880
He has released Humayun’s video as well.

160
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,680
And I am absolutely certain

161
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,200
that he must have paid a heavy amount of cash in return to Humayun’s wife.

162
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,400
Humayun Afzal’s wife is also just as greedy as Humayun Afzal was.

163
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,800
She is ready to provide evidence against me.

164
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:39,840
Sahib, this fellow is bent upon destroying your name and honor.

165
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:46,800
My Noor-e-Jaan is in the hands of that despicable person, that is why I am helpless!

166
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:55,120
Otherwise, just for using my name with Humayun Afzal’s wife and Saira’s family,

167
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,960
I would have done that scoundrel such a deed

168
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,640
that he would have groveled on the floor asking for my forgiveness.

169
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,440
Buwa Ji, I do not understand what you are saying with these half said words and confusing statements.

170
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,480
Please, speak clearly. Where is Anna? What has happened to her?

171
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,960
I don’t know where Anna is either.

172
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,520
She gave me a call yesterday sounding very troubled.

173
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,800
I don’t know where she’s disappeared after that.

174
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,760
Hold on a minute there. Anna had called you yesterday. What was she saying?

175
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,320
She was crying a lot. She seemed very troubled.

176
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,040
I came here all the way from Sukkur after hearing her so troubled.

177
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:50,000
Believe me, Farhana Bibi. I had left my work here.

178
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,960
I had no intention of coming back to Sahab’s house.

179
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,200
However, when I got Anna’s call, I just could not hold myself back and I came back here.

180
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,400
The memory of the sister you lost years ago is disturbing you

181
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,520
while I am consumed by uneasiness about Anna.

182
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,440
You had lost your sister so many years ago in the past.

183
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,240
I hope you don’t lose your niece, the last reminder of your only sister.

184
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,200
God forbid such a thing, Buwa Ji. How can you say something like that?

185
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,680
Amaan is with Anna then why are you so worried?

186
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,080
Amaan is with Anna, that is what worries me.

187
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,520
Anna faces danger from Amaan.

188
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,800
Amaan is not what he seems in reality as he portrays himself to others.

189
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:47,320
He had married Anna to take revenge from Sahab over some animosity a long time ago.

190
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,400
What?

191
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,560
Did Anna tell you all this?

192
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,000
Yes. My dearest child was crying so much.

193
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,560
Her voice sounded very troubled and agitated.

194
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,560
It was because of this that I had wanted to meet Sahab

195
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:11,960
so that he could use his influence to find out about the whereabouts of Amaan and Anna.

196
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,840
Where did Anna call you from?

197
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,800
I wouldn’t know. At first I thought she had called me from her home

198
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:26,360
but when I came here, I found out that they both are not here.

199
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,080
Don’t know where they have gone.

200
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,680
Whose number did she use to call you?

201
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,720
It was from her own number.

202
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,000
But her number is disconnected, Buwa Ji.

203
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,120
Oh, God! What sort of confusion is this? Why am I unable to understand any of this, Buwa Ji?

204
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,120
Yes, Sajid. I’m coming to Islamabad. Get my work done.

205
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,120
Forget about what, why and how! Just do what I asked!

206
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,800
I will explain the rest after I reach Islamabad.

207
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,880
It is time now…

208
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,700
Shah Sahab, it has been three whole days

209
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,980
and there’s still no information leading to my daughter’s whereabouts.

210
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,900
What is the point of having such connections and influences

211
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,700
when I’m unable to recover my daughter from her captors?

212
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,500
Do not give me reassurances.

213
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,940
I want my daughter in my home by tomorrow

214
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,500
or I will make life miserable and a living hell for everyone.

215
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,620
Sahib, today is the Valima Ceremony of Senator Gibran Shah’s son. You remember that, right?

216
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,740
I have no recollection except that of my Noor-e-Jaan.

217
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,860
Sahib, it is very important for you to attend tonight.

218
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,980
There is no information about the whereabouts of my Noor-e-Jaan for the past three days

219
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:02,540
Every moment of my life is a living hell, I’m finding it difficult to breathe

220
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,740
Sahib,

221
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:13,020
I know Baby is very important but your honor, your well-being

222
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,380
and your reputation is also very important.

223
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,660
The video of Humayun Afzal’s wife has been distributed everywhere tonight.

224
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,260
If you do not go to that Ceremony today,

225
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:28,540
people will get the opportunity to talk and spread rumors against you.

226
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,900
A lot of people from the media will be there as well.

227
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,260
You can tell them

228
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:39,540
that all of this is an organized conspiracy against you by your business opponents.

229
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:46,740
You can tell the media that the accusations of Humayun Afzal’s wife are all baseless lies

230
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,220
and you can also say

231
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,900
that you will be registering a case of character assassination against her.

232
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,780
Sahib, Amaanullah is only doing all this so that you can be publicly disgraced,

233
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:02,460
He is well aware about the fact that you distressed and worried about Baby.

234
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:07,100
That is why, as soon as he saw the opportunity, he has raised this issue of Humayun Afzal’s wife.

235
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,180
This is exactly what he wants, Sahib.

236
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:13,940
He wants you to take a step under duress which will lead you to publicly disgrace yourself.

237
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:19,700
Sahib, don’t let that new kid on the block make a spectacle of your dishonor.

238
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,860
Weigh everything before taking the next step.

239
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,620
Don’t let Amaanullah’s conspiracies succeed, Sahib.

240
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,660
Excuse me,

241
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,620
Sir. How much truth is in the accusations against you by Humayun Afzal’s wife?

242
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:48,060
Listen, I consider it an insult to answer such baseless questions.

243
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:53,780
And it is with great regret that I have been forced to say that Mrs. Humayun Afzal

244
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,780
has joined up with my opponents.

245
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,460
Give me a chance and I will answer all your questions.

246
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:05,100
Since the Case is in the Court now, any answers to be provided will be provided by my Lawyers.

247
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,420
However, it is necessary to let you know

248
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:12,940
that I am registering a Case of Character Assassination against Mrs. Humayun.

249
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:17,820
Look, my business has been established since the 1920s.

250
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,860
My forefathers have built up this Empire with a lot of dedication, honor and hard work.

251
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:28,540
So, any kind of business that stands based upon respect and honorable principles

252
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,220
does not fear anything. Thank you very much.

253
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,740
Please come, Sir. Let me introduce you to Mr. Khurshid.

254
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,020
Oh, okay, fine.

255
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,540
Mr. Khurshid, Mr. Mir.

256
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,100
Mir Sahab, how are you?

257
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,260
How are you, Mr. Khurshid? Everything fine?

258
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,500
Thank you very much for inviting me.

259
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,020
We heard the news about A.K. Oil Refineries being sold, Mr. Amaan.

260
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,660
We had assumed that you would have left the country as well.

261
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,340
No, I have just sold off the business for now. I have no intentions of leaving Pakistan.

262
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,700
By the way these people who spread rumors do a good job of it too.

263
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,860
Ofcourse.

264
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,180
Excuse me.

265
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,540
Greetings, dear father-in-law.

266
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,500
Where is my daughter?

267
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,900
Where are you hiding her?

268
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,260
First things first. Let go of my arm. Let’s talk calmly.

269
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,780
Where’s my daughter?

270
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,180
I will tell you where your daughter is. Don’t get tense and atleast meet your son-in-law first?

271
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,860
I have come to meet you from so very far away.

272
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,860
You know what? I have not introduced myself properly to you.

273
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:42,220
I’m thinking that today I should introduce myself properly to you.

274
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:49,220
My name is Amaanullah Khan. I used to be lovingly called Mani in my childhood.

275
00:27:52,180 --> 00:28:01,260
Many years ago at Darya Bagh, lived a Forest Officer, Ubaidullah Khan.

276
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,460
I am his one and only son.

277
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,260
I’m sure you know Humaira Ubaidullah Khan, right?

278
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,620
She was my mother.

279
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:20,380
My parents and my younger sister died in an accident.

280
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:29,140
Actually, that wasn’t an accident. They were murdered.

281
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:33,860
Now it is my good fortune that I survived. Otherwise they would have killed me as well.

282
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:43,420
Ubaidullah Khan - Humaira Ubaidullah Khan - Ayesha Ubaidullah Khan - Amaanullah Khan.

283
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:53,180
I am very pleased to make your acquaintance. I am very pleased indeed.

284
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,540
But my…..

285
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:27,100
Ali Bakhsh, close down all exits!

286
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:35,220
Amaanullah was here. Don’t know where he disappeared to as we were talking.

287
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:40,580
Get a checkpoint activated everywhere. He must not escape!

288
00:29:48,604 --> 00:29:54,904
You have been trying to call continously since evening, no one has connected you to him

289
00:29:55,928 --> 00:29:59,228
They are saying that he is not at home

290
00:30:01,252 --> 00:30:04,352
I don't know where Anna might be and how she is.

291
00:30:06,376 --> 00:30:09,776
Amaan might have killed him

292
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,400
God forbid Buwa Ji, what are you saying

293
00:30:13,424 --> 00:30:15,424
If God wants nothig like this will happen

294
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:18,348
You are not understanding the danger Farhana Bibi

295
00:30:19,372 --> 00:30:24,972
Amaan has a very big enmity...and for taking revenge he can go to any level

296
00:30:26,496 --> 00:30:30,196
Anna's life is in danger

297
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,220
Don't know where Amaan has taken her

298
00:30:34,744 --> 00:30:38,944
When I talked to Anna yesterday, I should have asked her that where is she

299
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:49,068
Buwa Ji, he says that many years ago his parents and little sister were murdered in Darya Bagh, and Agha Jaan is responsible for that

300
00:30:50,292 --> 00:30:53,492
Buwa Ji what is our connection with Darya Bagh?

301
00:30:55,316 --> 00:30:57,716
Farhana Bibi, you come with me

302
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,740
Where?

303
00:30:59,764 --> 00:31:01,264
To Anna

304
00:31:01,288 --> 00:31:05,288
What do you mean to Anna? We don't know that where are they

305
00:31:05,812 --> 00:31:08,712
We are trying to figure out this since evening

306
00:31:09,236 --> 00:31:13,936
No need to figure out, I know where has Amaan taken Anna

307
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,460
I don't know why it didn't come in mind earlier

308
00:31:18,484 --> 00:31:19,484
Where is she?

309
00:31:19,508 --> 00:31:21,008
She is in Darya Bagh

310
00:31:21,032 --> 00:31:23,632
Darya Bagh? Where is this?

311
00:31:24,656 --> 00:31:29,656
It's almost 6-7 hour drive from here

312
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,180
We have to reach there as soon as possible

313
00:31:33,704 --> 00:31:36,204
Are you sure that they are there?

314
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:39,728
Yes I am sure. I am damn sure about it

315
00:31:40,752 --> 00:31:49,852
To take his revenge from Sahib and Anna Darya Bagh is the only place where Amaan can take her

316
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:07,940
Sahib, I searched everywhere inside the hotel. He is nowhere to be found.

317
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,900
Damn it!

318
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,860
Are you sure that it was Amaanullah you saw?

319
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,260
It is possible that it was someone who just looked like him.

320
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:16,940
No…

321
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,500
He stood right in front of me and he was talking to me.

322
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:29,940
He said, with great dare and courage as he looked me in the eye

323
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,060
that he was Ubaidullah and Humaira’s son, Mani.

324
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:37,980
And that many years ago he lived at Darya Bagh with his parents.

325
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,060
What?

326
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,620
How is that possible? How can he be alive?

327
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,900
Forget about the how and why.

328
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,860
This is not the time for such matters.

329
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:57,620
Tell your guards to go and stand all around the hotel.

330
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,060
He cannot get out as quickly as that.

331
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,700
If he is inside the hotel then he will come out as well, right?

332
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:14,220
He was talking to me and he just vanished while we were holding a conversation.

333
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,340
And this time around, the same must not happen.

334
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:29,660
There is only one way to reach my Noor-e-Jaan and that is through Amaanullah.

335
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:38,860
The impertinent, shrewd and fearless way he had as he stood before me means only one thing.

336
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:46,260
He is certain that I cannot reach my Noor-e-Jaan without him.

337
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:55,020
He must not escape from this hotel, Ali Bakhsh. Explain this well to your guards.

338
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:00,220
I will not tolerate any sort of carelessness on their part.

339
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,380
Alright, Sahib. You needn’t worry.

340
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:13,619
My name is Amaanullah Khan

341
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:16,460
I used to be lovingly called Mani in my childhood.

342
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:24,420
Many years ago at Darya Bagh, lived a Forest Officer, Ubaidullah Khan.

343
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:31,820
I am his one and only son. I’m sure you know Humaira Ubaidullah Khan, right?

344
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,580
She was my mother.

345
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:42,460
My parents and my younger sister died in an accident. Actually, that wasn’t an accident.

346
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,060
They were murdered.

347
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:48,499
Now it is my good fortune that I survived. Otherwise they would have killed me as well.
