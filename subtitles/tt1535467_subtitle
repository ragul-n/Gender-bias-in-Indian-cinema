1
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:34,767
Nobody think in the age of 1 7 years
that I wiII become a smaII man

2
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,734
If I was aIso not thinking Iike that

3
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,771
What can happen by my thinking?

4
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:45,275
My father had aIready decided that

5
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,613
My name is Pargat Singh KaaIo

6
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,784
I'm Iiving Iife as my father toId me

7
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,768
Where is your father?
He is inside

8
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:19,245
Its just a smaII medicine for me
with hot water

9
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,192
They aIso toId them this

10
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,958
If you have visa and Advocate Sehni's
address than you wiII get work in EngIand

11
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,519
On that day my father changed

12
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,526
Now he onIy remember the caIIing
names of British men

13
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,327
Not our crying

14
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,160
What happen?

15
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:12,896
What happen to Sehni brother?

16
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:17,202
Lets go

17
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,041
Because of Advocate Sehni's death
there is a riot in South HaII

18
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:27,309
They kiIIed this oId man in a very
bad way

19
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,174
PeopIe caII them its a reIigious revenge

20
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:37,215
Asian peopIes are very angry because they
are thinking that inspite of proofs poIice is doing nothing

21
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,025
Everything was same

22
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,466
Babay said one thing that a Sikh
can never say

23
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,831
Father was fighting with them
with fuII power

24
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:32,035
In the beginning because for martydom uncIe
or may be because of our probIems

25
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:37,212
SIowIy sIowIy father was heIping others
in his fight

26
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,617
Because of anyone in South haII

27
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,689
Sometimes he gave speech and
sometimes he raised his hand

28
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,938
Those days were gone when we were
depending on Britishers

29
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:06,703
SIowIy sIowIy he made schooIs, dispensary
and praying pIaces

30
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:11,009
South haII became a smaII viIIage of Punjab

31
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:19,488
And my father was the Ieader
of South haII

32
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:23,693
And he had onIy one agenda and
one mission

33
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,671
Why I put down my head today?

34
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:39,544
Tomorrow they wiII put down their
heads infront of me

35
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:43,407
Everything was changed except
my father

36
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:51,555
Can these britishers make my bIood thin?

37
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:59,095
It wiII never happen.
My son wiII not pIay cricket for EngIand

38
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,940
Father gave his decision so
easiIy

39
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,702
He did what he wanted to do

40
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,871
I Iost myseIf there

41
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,912
Leave everyone.
I couId not see myseIf

42
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,099
And I'm onIy Iiving Iife as my father said

43
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,879
Give me your father's number

44
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,856
Do you want my sister's number?

45
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:38,669
My brother broke your window,
I come here to pay for it

46
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,719
I just toId him to dont pIay

47
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,257
What wiII happen if you say no?

48
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,554
Simran ChaggaI.
Dont waste my time

49
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,529
I cannot accept this card

50
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,734
Why?
Is it against your personaIity?

51
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:09,240
Because I have a good reputation
in South haII?

52
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:14,612
And if I become then wiII you
accept?

53
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:20,811
Because Rose Martin name is written
on in it

54
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,685
Its my mother's card.
She toId me I can use it

55
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,397
Its not Iike I cannot afford it.
I have Iots of my personaI cards too

56
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:50,345
I wiII not pay for window.
Return me my cards

57
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,678
When your boss wiII deduct your
money then you wiII know

58
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,196
He was my aImost fiance.
We were about to get married

59
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,734
Now there is no use to say sorry

60
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:27,685
You know what not everyone can get
this card, you have to earn 10000 points

61
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:44,928
My father aIso became a probIem
whiIe facing probIems

62
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:54,742
Jassi and his wife preety,
aII were Iiving Iife as father said

63
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,739
Nobody knew this

64
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,944
Everyone knew that its father's order

65
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:11,929
What poIice wiII do without press?

66
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,601
What happen?

67
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,139
Nothing.
You are Iooking very beautifuI

68
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,146
Father is going to fight with poIice

69
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,090
Your marriage is canceI

70
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,139
How you can do this?

71
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,351
We are fighting for your house

72
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,526
Dont bring pummy's in Iaws so
fast to home

73
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:21,362
What happen? Father tore construction of
AIi. He is coming with poIice

74
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,238
You again come to tease me

75
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,299
They aII are getting arrest infront
of my in Iaws

76
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,355
I had been cheif guest of
these peopIes

77
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,349
Ok say

78
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,726
I wiII see you

79
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,264
Dont stop me

80
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,588
Sorry I'm Iate.
Its ok

81
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,302
Why you need aII of it?

82
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,744
Again daiIy same drama.
Nothing is changed

83
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,439
They have changed it

84
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,345
His chiIdren was not getting admission in schooI

85
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,650
They have changed it

86
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:43,700
They aII are fooI

87
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,304
Are you ok?

88
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,143
Yes I'm fine

89
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,941
Take this your medicine

90
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,447
You become hyper for nothing

91
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,493
They are coming

92
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,635
Why you are wearing white?

93
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,745
Are we fooI because we were
crazy about matching coIors?

94
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:26,073
I'm pIanning since you were
not born

95
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,019
Ok I'm not going to invite you
on my wedding

96
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,117
Why are you crying?

97
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:40,858
You have to cry at Iast moments.
I toId you this before

98
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,851
Is everything ok?

99
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,288
They came here for charity

100
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,991
As they came to know that there is a
marriage in house, they come here

101
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:15,266
I show you my house

102
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:19,165
WiII Ranveer Iive here after marriage?

103
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,904
It takes a Iifetime to make house
in London Iike this

104
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:29,102
I was thinking...
You dont think much

105
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,872
Its our work to think

106
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:35,019
Bring them inside

107
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:39,715
Neither they are britishers nor enemy,
but father scoId them for nothing

108
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,319
Nobody knows

109
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:55,197
You have to pick up bobby from schooI

110
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:59,966
Let Gattu puII Iuggage

111
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:08,545
Monty has bring a speciaI news for
Radio 1 1 1

112
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:13,447
In Iast few series there is a bad performance
of EngIand cricket team, there is emergency meeting

113
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,792
They aII have to think something
different

114
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,186
Can you confirm aII team is going to change?

115
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:50,084
On that same night what happen
to that?

116
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:54,285
He out me in Iast 3 innings

117
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:03,495
You have to conveince your IocaI

118
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:06,799
Thats the probIem,

119
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:11,274
I dont have to conveince him
I have to conveince some other

120
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,467
DoIIy was saying it was your sister's marriage
then you shouId dance

121
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,238
Why dont you say anything
to father?

122
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:20,475
We did not make him grow up
for house son in Iaw

123
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:23,708
What can I do?

124
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:49,731
What do you think?
AII these sardars wiII do dance in church?

125
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:54,042
You have drank aIot

126
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:55,903
I can stiII see father's guys

127
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:58,004
I can stiII Iisten to them

128
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,658
You have drank aIot

129
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:51,527
Are you ok?

130
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:55,731
What did they caII you?

131
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,308
I did not recognize you

132
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:12,647
It was a Iong time.
I saw you in chiIdhood

133
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,879
I was waiting for you

134
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,965
Do you know who is that
boy with him?

135
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:32,299
He is a son of his friend

136
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:37,606
First she went to boIIywood then
she did dirty works

137
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:42,771
You couId aIso went to boIIywood

138
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:00,556
What you caII Simran here?

139
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:02,760
What is probIem in Simran?

140
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,002
Her mother is white

141
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:12,933
And her father was Sardar

142
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:22,110
I was saying truth

143
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,887
I was about to get engaged with you

144
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,485
My friends and me aIways discuus
who wiII marry you

145
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:30,793
Then we have decided that we
aII cannot marry you

146
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:36,590
It was very simpIe. Safeena was disquaIified
that time because she was under age

147
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:39,927
She aIways Iiked Jassi

148
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,606
Then who Ieft?

149
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,909
I said father wiII spit on white
daughter in Iaw

150
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:52,940
I wiII cIean it.
I won

151
00:30:57,722 --> 00:31:00,088
You never notice me?

152
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:05,222
If you noticed me than it wouId be
our wedding today

153
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,526
A combine marriage with Manmeet

154
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,941
Where is Gattu?

155
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,370
I Iive in that house since Iast
6 years

156
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:56,475
DaiIy I see you here

157
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:00,716
EngIand cricket team needs a fast bowIer

158
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,915
There wiII be a triots in 2 weeks

159
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:10,522
If you want then I wiII taIk to your father.
My father has opened a shop for me in South haII

160
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,228
I'm a shop keeper and I want to
remain a shop keeper

161
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:38,178
I have made Raajma (curry) and Rice for you.
May I re-heat it?

162
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:45,992
Today... Punit is mad.
He says fooIish things

163
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:49,265
He said sorry to father

164
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:15,054
Today I boy's baII came in my shop
and it broke a window

165
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:19,624
Say everything cIearIy

166
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:23,928
Dont try to hide your probIems

167
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:29,297
ChiIdrens can never hide anything
from their mothers

168
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:33,575
I dont say anything and my
mother understands my probIem

169
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:39,341
May be it was my Iife's siIence or upcoming
riot's sound

170
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:57,021
Puneet has reaIIy made a mistake

171
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:00,762
He shouId say this to you that
he toId to you

172
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:03,094
Why without any reason. No there is a reason.
AII because of my father he Ieft everything

173
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:13,434
Since Parter took our money and

174
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:19,912
I'm so scared that one day he wiII become
Jassi into Gattu

175
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:25,354
A shadow of a man

176
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,584
I have to give food to Bobby

177
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,068
Someone wants to say sorry to you

178
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,809
Say sorry to uncIe

179
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,073
Did you see that?

180
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:56,351
You had a good experience to
how to deaI with chiIdrens?

181
00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:00,322
I dont know how peopIe make
so many chiIdrens

182
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:11,661
I know how they produce chiIdrens.
I Iived in Andheri and it has a biggest popuIation in state

183
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,296

184
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:28,945
I dont want baby sitter

185
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,919
If she is cute than teII me

186
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,346
AtIeast she shouId be 16 years oId

187

I dont want aunty type

188

00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:44,226
I wiII do hang out with Gattu

190
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:48,065
I dont think you are a busy peopIe

191
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:55,271
I'm not interested to be a baby sitter

192
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,182
What are you doing?

193
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,550
Your one wish is fuIfiIIed

194
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:19,628
Lets go. Where?
To watch a match at community centre

195
00:37:20,034 --> 00:37:30,628
Coolbudy2007 - NaveeN @ -=DrC=-

196
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:35,309
I cannot see from here

197
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,778
I'm going to front side

198
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:44,285
Father is caIIing you

199
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:56,335
Its a good chance to meet boy and girI each other.
But why? I have done it

200
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:03,639
You make your wedding cIothes

201
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:22,794
Its a Manchester famiIy and
its a very good famiIy

202
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:38,171
One day he has to fix my marriage

203
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:08,240
Why are you going?
Why we cannot watch match?

204
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,774
If you dont want to watch then
dont watch

205
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:21,887
Again I'm saying. There is a seIection of EngIand team.
I strongIy feeI you have to join it

206
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,224
What is your opinion about today's game?

207
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,995
Why dont you ask them?

208
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:32,826
He is a IocaI hero of South haII

209
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,902
You teII them

210
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,920
Who is Partag Singah KaaIo?

211
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,691
You ask many questions?

212
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:08,705
Whenever India wins, we give to sweets
to whoIe South HaII

213
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:14,902
Its our beIief. No matter its a smaII match
or its a 1983 WorId Cup finaI

214
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:26,856
He is a son of LaIa Amarnath

215
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,085
Do bowIing Iike him

216
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:39,401
When LaIa Ji did bowIing,
aII batsman became confused

217
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:45,172
You drink bear

218
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:50,310
Why you send this appIication?

219
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,849
WiII father aIIow me to do this work?

220
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:03,454
Whatever was happenning with him,
that was aIso good

221
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:06,761
If Edward wiII not be in your marriage
then it wiII be ok

222
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:11,433
Nobody wiII do anything
Nobody wiII say anything

223
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:17,966
His own son....
What happen? Say

224
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:22,568
1 sorry is not enough for you?

225
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:31,349
Gattu you go from here

226
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:36,553
Why you aIIowed him to go?
I'm not scared of him

227
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:41,726
Who is he?
A reaI son of father

228
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:49,197
Because of him we are in this condition.
Everytime he says this become Iike Gattu

229
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:56,143
Live ordinary Iife.
Do ordinary work

230
00:41:56,614 --> 00:42:02,075
He is not capabIe to do anything.
He is just a bIoody puppet

231
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,588
And father thinks that we aIso
have a ordinary Iife Iike him

232
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:56,931
I can say onIy one thing.
You are fantastic

233
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:59,533
Your schooI aIso come.
SchooI starts at 8 AM

234
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:04,712
you have 2 hours Ieft

235
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,953
Someone was asking from outside
that why you Ieft?

236
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:19,091
Same question daiIy my wife ask from me

237
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:26,559
I dont know why this boy is asking this
question from me?

238
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,510
Stand up.
Do you have any probIem?

239
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:11,704
Ok I dont ask

240
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:22,357
I was asking why he Ieft?

241
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,194
It happens in this age

242
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:37,906
You aIso stay away from me

243
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:43,970
I did not do anything.
You wiII do it

244
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:47,015
You aIso stay away from me Iike him

245
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,234
So why did you quit?

246
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:14,744
Why did you take that decision?
Why did you quit cricket?

247
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,174
You are just a chiId, you won't
understand, I am 12.

248
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:21,042
And you were not so young when you
quit pIaying cricket.

249
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:25,080
If you couId decide it in that age then
I couId understand this decision.

250
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,017
Nor you can understand nor that Bedi.

251
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,927
You are saying no for engIand.

252
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:43,630
Mr. Bedi is asking you for seIection,

253
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:47,407
He is giving you second chance in your
Iife, How couId you say No Gattu?

254
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:50,371
Just Imagine now you can pIay
aII over the worId.

255
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:52,204
For fans and for crowd,

256
00:45:57,054 --> 00:46:00,046
Because my papa's heart wiII be broken
he wiII die.

257
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:12,897
You wiII pIay for EngIand,

258
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:16,697
You wiII pIay against India,
I can't pIay with India either.

259
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:19,574
India won't Iet me pIay.

260
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:23,146
I am a British Citizen,
Why don't you say British Pawn?

261
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:26,949
It's my mistake that you came here
and settIed down.

262
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:30,046
I pIay and I pIay weII.

263
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,184
What makes a difference that I pIay
for EngIand, what's a difference?

264
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:36,925
You're not so chiId that you have
forgotten what happened with Mr. Sahini.

265
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:40,359
I have put my bIood to raised you up.

266
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:43,355
If these white peopIe wants...

267
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,759
then they won't aIIow to breathe here.

268
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:48,268
And you are saying what makes
a difference?

269
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:50,530
You don't say anything,

270
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:53,003
If you wiII say anything then take
him aIong from here.

271
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:56,345
I wiII consider that I didn't got
marry you and son is so far away.

272
00:46:57,714 --> 00:46:59,545
Mom! you go outside.
Why?

273
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:02,845
Papa! I wanna taIk to you,
No need of that.

274
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:08,715
I said that you won't pIay.

275
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,790
If you wiII pIay then I wiII die.

276
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:13,520
Think about it.

277
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,292
Gattu! Simran! Fast!

278
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:53,036
If she is Iocked up in washroom then
why did you caII me,

279
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:55,269
Have you seen OM SHANTI OM?

280
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:58,465
In that movie Shahrukh didn't fuIfiII
his dream in one Iife so he born back

281
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:01,139
And you are getting chance again,

282
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:06,307
What?
You thought I won't teII her.

283
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,275
You won't get anything to staring me,

284
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:09,779
Better Iook at this.

285
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:13,314
You want to hide from papa then
Iook for it.

286
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,125
What's this?
Make-up, Wig.

287
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,659
We wiII totaIIy change you,

288
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:20,192
I mean Simran wiII change you,
Yes!

289
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:21,895
It's possibIe,
I can do it.

290
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,133
I can make you anything with make-up.

291
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,709
He is just a chiId,
He won't understand,

292
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:39,377
You are grown up,
You shouId understand.

293
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,575
ObviousIy! he is Iike her mom,

294
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:51,761
I mean sister.

295
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:53,958
I didn't meant his mom,

296
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:56,931
No! you said mom,

297
00:48:59,202 --> 00:48:59,691
Like others....

298
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:06,604
Go upstairs.

299
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:14,112
I was the paying guest of his mom,

300
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:16,948
He was 3 years oId.

301
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,115
When his dad Ieft them both.

302
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,486
After one year AaiIyah met someone
on internet in canada.

303
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:25,160
AaIiyah didn't toId him that she
have a son,

304
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,423
And she Ieft zee to me,

305
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:30,364
and toId me that she wiII come soon,

306
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:32,958
It's been nine years today.

307
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:36,868
And from nine years me and
zee are friends.

308
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,304
We are support for each other.

309
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:41,137
And we are saving each other to
drown up.

310
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:51,953
If you wiII see something is drowning,

311
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:54,322
then wiII you try to save him,

312
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:56,985
Ofcourse.

313
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:00,389
zee is doing the same,

314
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:02,931
He knows what doesn drowning means,

315
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:07,904
He even knows...

316
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:09,965
If one hand wiII take you...

317
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:11,871
then your Iife couId be safe,

318
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:21,215
You don't know how to swim,

319
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:29,323
You have aIready drowned for your
famiIy.

320
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:13,996
If you wiII pIay then I wiII die.

321
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,368
Like British are respnsibIe
for Veer Jee.

322
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,602
You wiII be responsibIe for my death.

323
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:26,593
Why did you teII them?

324
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:30,569
In this house nobody can Iive his ife.

325
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:34,210
Because you have aIways obeyed
your father.

326
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:37,670
You have sacrified your dreams
for papa.

327
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,350
Now they are not permitted to
watch dreams.

328
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:44,585
And if somebody wants to do
something,

329
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:47,348
then their mouth has been shut to
give them your exampIe.

330
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:51,817
Who is responsbiIe to save their Iives?

331
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:57,323
I couIdn't do anything for myseIf.

332
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:00,893
What wiII I do for aII of them?

333
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:20,249
You are getting another chance
to fuIfiII your dream,

334
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:21,549
And we....

335
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:24,324
We didn't get a singIe chance.

336
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:38,970
He wanted to become chef,
and he is frying JaIebi.

337
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,271
Aman is driving cab.

338
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:05,531
Gattu! if we want to get rid of this
Iife then we couIdn't...

339
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:07,160
but you...

340
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,364
who is reaIIy very taIented.

341
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:13,274
You are ready to Iive this Iife.

342
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:16,541
No! we are not ready.

343
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:19,343
Sorry! but now this decision is
not yours...

344
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,584
What do you mean?
You wiII pIay...

345
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,415
For yourseIf,
For aII of us.

346
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:28,223
How?

347
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,989
Papa wiII turn on the TV and he
won't find out.

348
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:36,695
He wiII read newspaper.
Radio or Phone.

349
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:39,625
He won't see my bowIing,

350
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:45,741
I can't pIay If I want.

351
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:00,816
Just show us to make your
dream come true.

352
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,084
Show us to win,

353
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:07,754
then Papa wiII reaIize...

354
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:10,858
then for that right he is fighting
he aIready got it.

355
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:21,470
Everything is changed.

356
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:24,873
Now onIy he have to change.

357
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:28,048
Then PatiaIa House

358
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:34,182
can ask his Iife proudIy back
to papa.

359
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:38,052
I can ask my Iife back,

360
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:54,675
We wiII handIe everything.

361
00:56:58,214 --> 00:57:00,205
Today first time I was something
for them,

362
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:02,784
Notjust something but more enough,

363
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:06,822
Because first time they saw a chance
to change their Iives.

364
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:09,114
What onIy I can give them,

365
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:30,779
PeopIe of PatiaIa House and they had
onIy one thing commom,

366
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:34,640
Anger against me,
their frustration,

367
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:39,088
Today they have become a famiIy
to beIieving in me,

368
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:54,228
Now nor I know what wiII happen next
nor them,

369
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:58,769
Then what shouId we do,
ShaII we Ieft everything on God.

370
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:17,193
Same door...
Same stairs.

371
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,990
But today I feeI that way is new.

372
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:24,863
and may be my destiny wiII be around,

373
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:32,206
You wiII wear this,
Why?

374
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,075
No! nothing,

375
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:37,577
Cricket don't need cIothes.

376
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:15,113
Do you remember?

377
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,986
Don't be nervous.
It wiII aII be okay.

378
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:28,360
Be confident I am here.

379
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,089
They were notjust taking the decision
of engIish team's future

380
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:37,919
nor my Iife.

381
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:41,392
but they were taking decision of
the destiny of PatiaIa House.

382
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:27,832
Why are you Iaughing?

383
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:35,940
Now wake me up!

384
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:39,617
I can't take this nightmare anymore.

385
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,486
You are Iike my mom,

386
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,626
If she won't be british then she
must be Punjabi.

387
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:55,102
And usuaIy reaction happens when
we don't have eggs in house.

388
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:58,531
ActuaIIy they are not finished.

389
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:00,938
But what it concerns with our pIan,

390
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:03,608
That's what I am teIIing you,

391
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:07,207
We have eggs,
We have pIan.

392
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:11,184
Don't panic.

393
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:12,682
We wiII handIe everything,

394
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:14,923
You go for training,
You aIready need some training.

395
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:21,327
Everyone wiII Iaugh,
40 years oId man.

396
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:25,024
Whatever!
But you need training,

397
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,188
You don't have pIan.

398
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:52,426
Why wouId I have pIan,
But you said it.

399
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:54,823
So what?
Why don't you have pIan?

400
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:00,332
Now who wiII convert Papa.

401
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,903
Papa wiII put his hand on Gattu's head

402
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:05,663
and he wiII say go my son and pIay
with EngIand.

403
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:09,872
Ofcourse he won't change aII we
have to hide it from him.

404
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:12,404
That's very easy.

405
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:14,806
TeII entire South HaII that hide
it from Papa.

406
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:17,317
Not entire South HaII just those peopIe

407
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:18,818
who reguIarIy meets Papa,

408
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:31,761
We have wedding in the house.

409
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:38,171
We have wedding in the house,
Everyone knew it.

410
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:40,466
Wedding means guests...

411
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:49,377
Papa can know anytime from anyone.

412
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,878
So shaII we stop this wedding?
ShaII we reduce guests?

413
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:57,758
TeII me the truth Did Ranbhir said
something,

414
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:01,086
I just decide it.

415
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:03,495
It was my idea.

416
01:05:03,866 --> 01:05:07,529
I thought why do we need this wedding
with Iot of guests.

417
01:05:07,803 --> 01:05:10,704
Marriage is between two famiIies.

418
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:15,942
so why do we need 1500 guests.

419
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:36,755
When Gattu wiII win the man of the
series cup

420
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,468
then he wiII give it to us.

421
01:05:47,209 --> 01:05:48,904
Do you know I had a fiImi friend.

422
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:03,484
Everyone have a story in this famiIy.

423
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:06,160
They have some weakness,
We have to find out,

424
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:08,253
We aII are jobIess.

425
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:20,604
TiII today I thought we need taIent,
practise and hard work for cricket.

426
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:26,042
I forgot that team work is
most important,

427
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:28,983
But this team is pIaying to win,

428
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:35,689
Everyone was targetted in opposition
Nobody was saved,

429
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:38,726
Sooner they aII are getting exposed.

430
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:55,700
If gattu wiII pIay the cricket then
what's my benefit.

431
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:01,041
David Becham pIays footbaII but it
worths for his wife.

432
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:04,112
She is getting famous.

433
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:07,820
Think mom!
You wiII become posh!

434
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:15,555
And what about Aunt?

435
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:11,081
Keep Bau jee at home for
three weeks.

436
01:08:11,954 --> 01:08:14,115
I wiII teII you how you just
foIIow me,

437
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,850
Bau Jee feeIs that you're a doctor,
I am a doctor.

438
01:08:28,804 --> 01:08:29,668
Don't worry.

439
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:31,930
But the bad thing is that...

440
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:36,902
Your bIood pressure is 1 70-99

441
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,814
I mean,

442
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:43,717
Your bIood pressure wiII be fine,

443
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:45,817
You just don't step out the house,

444
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:48,011
That's fine,

445
01:08:49,592 --> 01:08:52,356
I won't go anywhere and cricket
is aIready getting started.

446
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:55,563
No! no cricket.

447
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:51,081
Now what about Gattu!
We have to hide it from him

448
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:54,352
No! we have to hide him,

449
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:55,170
We aII wouId be on streets.

450
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,814
I had my whoIe money in
my waIIet.

451
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,189
I can understand why you are
doing it aII?

452
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:17,261
And may be you aII too.

453
01:12:17,566 --> 01:12:19,193
But which day Bau Jee wiII ask me,

454
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:21,201
then I wiII teII him the truth.

455
01:13:27,202 --> 01:13:28,260
Who is this KaaIi?

456
01:13:29,338 --> 01:13:30,600
He is not from South haII.

457
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:34,072
I never seen him,

458
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:37,839
We don't know him,
Did I ask you?

459
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:44,546
Do you know who is this guy?

460
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:47,985
What makes a difference just sign the
cheque Gattu is waiting,

461
01:13:48,657 --> 01:13:50,090
You are very innocent,

462
01:13:50,793 --> 01:13:53,091
This guy is ruining his
parent's respect.

463
01:13:53,328 --> 01:13:54,522
and you are saying what makes
a difference,

464
01:14:02,838 --> 01:14:05,170
You have never seen this guy before,
That guy...

465
01:14:07,509 --> 01:14:08,407
Pick up the phone,

466
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:12,212
I am Sehra speaking from DehIi,

467
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:15,540
I got a phone caII from BBC that our
Gattu is pIaying for EngIand,

468
01:14:15,818 --> 01:14:18,446
I don't beIieve it,
How did Bau Jee agreed.

469
01:14:18,887 --> 01:14:20,650
His phone is out of reach,
Give him the phone.

470
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:21,721
I want to congratuIate him,

471
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:26,989
It's Gur DayaI Sehra's phone,

472
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:30,628
He wants to congratuIate you,

473
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:32,695
Get me the phone,

474
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:05,189
CaII Doctor UncIe.

475
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:47,541
What are you doing?
Practise!

476
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:51,602
Are you practising or punishing
your seIf?

477
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:54,680
I can't Iie to Bau Jee.

478
01:16:00,522 --> 01:16:03,047
What I want?
I just want to pIay.

479
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:06,083
Then do the same,
You just pIay.

480
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:07,985
And Ieave the rest on us.

481
01:16:28,383 --> 01:16:30,476
She didn't say anything what I
aIready didn't know.

482
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:49,031
I have spent my every moment
to reach this stadium,

483
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:52,273
What eIse I knew?

484
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:54,803
It was my identity,

485
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,579
Rather I beIive in myseIf or not,

486
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:10,314
but others have faith in me

487
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:14,557
Why they are foIIowing us?

488
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:16,822
Nobody is watching match
in this house.

489
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,196
Because we have no cabIe in
this house,

490
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:24,064
You teII me did somebody forgot to
pay cabIe biII in cricket season.

491
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:26,206
You and him...
what's his name?

492
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:27,933
KaaIi!
Don't caII his name,

493
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:31,441
There is no difference both of you,
Both are trying to sabotage us,

494
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:34,515
ReaIIy? how?
You both are against India.

495
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:36,548
We shouId make his face bIack.

496
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:57,972
You can watch TV at my home,

497
01:18:00,575 --> 01:18:01,633
Turn on the TV.

498
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:37,571
Our cabIe is aIso got disconnected.

499
01:19:37,839 --> 01:19:39,136
Disconnected?
CabIe!

500
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:48,506
Everyone's cabIe is disconnected,
It's British controversy.

501
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:54,811
No TV is here,
What's happening in South HaII.

502
01:20:55,717 --> 01:20:58,117
Don't know why but cabIe is
not working,

503
01:20:59,921 --> 01:21:01,684
Perminder's CabIe contract
is canceIIed.

504
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:40,127
BIack face, bIack deeds.

505
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:43,559
Let's see what wiII he do?

506
01:23:43,385 --> 01:23:44,545
Puneet toId me that you are here,

507
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:52,752
It's my shop where eIse I wouId be,

508
01:23:55,964 --> 01:23:57,625
You go I wiII meet you Iater.

509
01:24:05,473 --> 01:24:06,997
Why did I need to do this aII.

510
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:10,634
I was Iiving my Iife,

511
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:17,112
So I couId bIame everyone that they
are responsibIe for my faiIure,

512
01:24:18,953 --> 01:24:19,510
Not me...

513
01:24:24,926 --> 01:24:27,292

If you were intended to kiII me

01:48:23,129 --> 01:48:24,756
was it needy to bring me down

615

01:48:28,301 --> 01:48:29,393
But what I did?

617
01:48:30,937 --> 01:48:32,837
Just dared to see the IittIe dream.

618
01:48:33,306 --> 01:48:34,898

01:48:51,825 --> 01:48:53,850
We're just permited to
take breath.

622
01:48:57,364 --> 01:49:00,993
No one dare to Iive his own Iife here.

623
01:49:02,335 --> 01:49:03,563
Who's Iife I've ruined?

624

It was my mistake.

630
01:49:53,153 --> 01:49:53,983
You're right

631
01:49:56,256 --> 01:49:58,724
But my mistake is not that
I was pIaying cricket.

632
01:50:00,527 --> 01:50:03,052
But its the mistake that
I was about to quit the cricket.

01:50:08,468 --> 01:50:13,269
Father, I'd not go to stadium..

They are not mine too

655
01:53:04,711 --> 01:53:05,405
but this house is mine.

656
01:53:06,613 --> 01:53:08,308
I Didn't buiIt it on Iand but on my waist.

01:56:07,427 --> 01:56:08,826
I had just a dream to pIay cricket.

668
01:56:13,366 --> 01:56:16,824
ActuaIIy my presence here is
very important for him

669
01:56:17,904 --> 01:56:20,498
That noise..
he heared it before me..

670
01:56:24,577 --> 01:56:27,137
I just sees my father's dream.

671
01:56:28,247 --> 01:56:29,271
Which I fuIfiIIed today

672
01:56:30,850 --> 01:56:32,112
My father is very proud of me.

673
01:56:33,019 --> 01:56:34,111
he aIways used to say

674
01:56:50,069 --> 01:56:51,730
You were saying that
he pIays good. yes he do

675
01:56:53,806 --> 01:56:56,036
But he's not pIaying with heart

676
01:56:57,744 --> 01:56:58,802
how can he pIay

677
01:56:59,846 --> 01:57:01,711
his father broken his heart so

678
01:57:08,921 --> 01:57:12,652
If I'd not turn off the T.v..
so who'II take me to stadium?

679
01:59:14,213 --> 01:59:16,010
in the way kaIi pIayed in the tournament.

01:59:16,649 --> 01:59:19,709
Captain stiI trust on kaIi

681
02:02:44,857 --> 02:02:47,223

that he's not out..

682
02:02:47,727 --> 02:02:48,625
and shawn is out.

683
02:03:00,272 --> 02:03:02,297
everybody is waiting for the decision
of the third empire..

684
02:03:16,055 --> 02:03:17,044
