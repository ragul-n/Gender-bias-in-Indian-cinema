1
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:46,770
Everyone in the world laughs.
And that's what makes life cheerful.

2
00:02:47,476 --> 00:02:52,470
But this is the story of this
strange man who never ever laughs.

3
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:58,681
This is Shekhar, who is
returning from abroad.

4
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:32,381
This is the old mansion. A place which
has never known what laughter is.

5
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:38,285
The moment he arrives, his staff
spring to attention.

6
00:03:40,296 --> 00:03:47,793
Meet the unmoving rock in the family.
The lady who has borne with volcano.

7
00:03:48,404 --> 00:03:50,770
This is Shekhar's mother.

8
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:22,797
Here's your son, Shekhar. He has
returned successful from America.

9
00:04:24,173 --> 00:04:29,475
I remember your words. "Feed the
children gold, if necessary"

10
00:04:30,413 --> 00:04:32,108
"But see that they grow up
like lions"

11
00:04:32,915 --> 00:04:36,578
That's the principle we have been
following in this family.

12
00:04:37,386 --> 00:04:39,115
You were so very right.

13
00:04:40,256 --> 00:04:45,558
Laughter makes our children like
any other people. They turn cowards.

14
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:51,022
Leading businessmen abroad were
astounded by my business acumen.

15
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,766
They asked me the secret of my success.
I replied...

16
00:04:54,036 --> 00:04:58,803
it was the training my
mother had imparted to me...

17
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,407
the principle of "no-laughter"
that runs in the family...

18
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:03,269
and my father's blessings.

19
00:05:04,313 --> 00:05:08,511
When I went abroad, chances of a
thriving business were zero per cent.

20
00:05:09,218 --> 00:05:13,450
But I did not cry. I fought till the
chances were 100 per cent in my favor.

21
00:05:14,056 --> 00:05:19,892
What you said last smacks
of self-praise, Shekhar.

22
00:05:21,464 --> 00:05:25,798
Isn't it also wrong to hear
people praising you all the time?

23
00:05:28,137 --> 00:05:35,339
Praise is what praise should be.
- In that case, I withdraw my words.

24
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:41,880
"This was the loving union between
mother and son after three years"

25
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:45,914
"Love, which this unfortunate mother
never got in her life"

26
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:49,988
"From her husband, she got principles,
children and a famous family"

27
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:54,120
"She gave her children everything too.
But love, she could not give them"

28
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,194
There's a beautiful girl
in this family...

29
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,927
"who happens to be Shekhar's sister".

30
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,438
"Her disposition is exactly the
opposite of her mother and brother"

31
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,607
"She's going through the
tribulations of youth..."

32
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:09,871
"she's in love with someone"

33
00:06:10,813 --> 00:06:13,805
"Love, the birthright
of every human being"

34
00:06:14,517 --> 00:06:18,317
"She laughs. And she loves.
On the sly, however"

35
00:06:18,787 --> 00:06:21,051
"She's afraid, that should her
brother and mother get to know..."

36
00:06:21,524 --> 00:06:22,889
"she'd land in major trouble"

37
00:06:32,801 --> 00:06:34,393
Why have you come here?

38
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:37,331
Why does a young man seek out
a young woman?

39
00:06:37,706 --> 00:06:39,537
My brother's arriving today.
If he sees you here...

40
00:06:39,808 --> 00:06:42,902
he'll shoot you.
- I'm ready to die.

41
00:06:43,178 --> 00:06:46,739
For how will we meet
clandestinely like this?

42
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,451
Why don't you tell
your brother we're in love?

43
00:06:50,853 --> 00:06:53,947
That we want to get married.
- The day he gets to know...

44
00:06:54,223 --> 00:06:57,784
that I'm in love with a man
who's a mere clerk in his office...

45
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,621
our heads will roll.
- I'm not scared of death, Mala.

46
00:07:03,098 --> 00:07:07,194
I may look like a weak man.
But at heart, I'm a brave king.

47
00:07:08,003 --> 00:07:11,803
My courage is like that of Salim's.
And my temper is like Changiz Khan's!

48
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:14,105
Brother is here.
- Goodness!

49
00:07:15,544 --> 00:07:17,034
Changiz Khan indeed.

50
00:07:18,847 --> 00:07:23,716
Brother's really here. Now what?
- I must hide.

51
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,569
Brother! You have arrived!
How are you?

52
00:07:54,016 --> 00:08:00,285
What's up? You look worried.
- I heard laughter in this room.

53
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,255
Who'd laugh here? Maybe someone did,
200 years ago...

54
00:08:04,493 --> 00:08:06,654
when this house was built.
- Dead!

55
00:08:06,895 --> 00:08:13,528
Have you forgotten my name?
- Isn't your name Mala?

56
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:18,470
You fondly call me Maala.
Not Mala.

57
00:08:18,841 --> 00:08:19,865
I'm dead!

58
00:08:27,783 --> 00:08:32,345
I was prepared for death.
Not for this ordeal.

59
00:08:32,621 --> 00:08:35,852
What could I do? Your brother's
going to be my brother-in-law.

60
00:09:16,465 --> 00:09:20,333
Is this any time to arrive?
- I'm sorry, sir. I'm 10 seconds late.

61
00:09:20,836 --> 00:09:22,531
I don't want anyone here to be
late even by a second!

62
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:39,385
Neeta who?
- Your secretary, sir.

63
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:47,353
My boyfriend has met with an
accident, sir. I'm at the hospital.

64
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:48,891
I want leave for a day.

65
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:53,691
No! Come to the office immediately.
Or you get leave for good!

66
00:10:17,593 --> 00:10:20,619
This office has nothing to do
with your boyfriend.

67
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,697
Quit the job, if you wish to romance!

68
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,137
The poor girl has made a mistake.
Forgive her.

69
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:33,407
Who'll make up for the work
lost because of the delay?

70
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:37,039
The two of us will.
- How?

71
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:40,414
We'll stay back this evening and
leave after the work is over.

72
00:10:40,783 --> 00:10:45,686
I don't want anyone coming late or
working a second beyond office hours.

73
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:52,226
Get me the Hong Kong file.

74
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:03,602
Call the Calcutta office and have
the dispatches sent to Singapore.

75
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:05,468
Very well.

76
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:21,621
It's like this, Shekhar.

77
00:11:22,524 --> 00:11:24,549
You have played in my lap
as a child.

78
00:11:26,161 --> 00:11:32,566
You always used to call me "Uncle".
Should you...

79
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:40,871
You can say that. But I've always
considered it to be my own home...

80
00:11:41,343 --> 00:11:43,607
You had better consider it
to be my office. And get to work.

81
00:11:49,451 --> 00:11:51,578
He doesn't even have
the manners to talk properly.

82
00:11:51,854 --> 00:11:53,981
Who'd work for him, if it
wasn't for sheer helplessness?

83
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:57,916
The manager slogged days and nights
to make this company a success.

84
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,861
And this how he treats him.

85
00:12:19,014 --> 00:12:19,844
Where are you going?

86
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:25,109
I was only taking a walk...

87
00:12:25,587 --> 00:12:27,851
Not a walk. It's fishy.

88
00:12:28,891 --> 00:12:31,121
Or you would have worn the slippers,
not carried them in your hands.

89
00:12:31,827 --> 00:12:36,059
Mother, I took them off because
I was getting a shoe-bite.

90
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:39,867
Know when you get a shoe-bite?

91
00:12:40,702 --> 00:12:43,170
When you wear a smaller size.
- No.

92
00:12:43,872 --> 00:12:46,966
You get a shoe-bite when
your feet grow too big.

93
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:51,674
When you start taking the wrong path.
Try to sneak out again...

94
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:53,776
and your legs will be broken.
Go to your room.

95
00:12:58,954 --> 00:13:01,320
Watchman...
- Madam?

96
00:13:02,124 --> 00:13:04,922
Without my orders, no one
leaves this place.

97
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:06,124
As you say, madam.

98
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:55,270
"You have wonderful eyes,
my love"

99
00:13:55,844 --> 00:14:05,742
"You're the one I'm in love with,
my love"

100
00:14:06,254 --> 00:14:10,884
"You have wonderful eyes,
my love"

101
00:14:21,703 --> 00:14:26,697
"I fell in love with you.
Was that a bad thing to do?

102
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,743
"I fell in love with you...
was that a sin?"

103
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:41,916
"For a gesture from your eyes,
I could ruin myself"

104
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:47,250
"I'm responsible for all this too"

105
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:52,057
"You have wonderful eyes,
my love"

106
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:57,664
"You are the one I love,
my darling"

107
00:15:21,763 --> 00:15:27,065
"Whatever you are, you are the one
I love to behold"

108
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:36,471
"Whatever you are, you are the one
I love to behold"

109
00:15:36,945 --> 00:15:41,609
"Into my life,
you bring Spring"

110
00:15:42,084 --> 00:15:47,078
"You're the one I desire,
my love"

111
00:15:47,456 --> 00:15:52,223
"You are the one I'm in love with,
my darling"

112
00:15:52,594 --> 00:15:57,258
"You have wonderful eyes, my love"

113
00:15:57,466 --> 00:16:02,130
"You are the one I'm in love with,
my darling"

114
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:06,807
"You have wonderful eyes, my love"

115
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:13,373
"You are the one I'm in love with,
my darling"

116
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,951
My father, the King, sends his
greetings. He is indisposed.

117
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,316
Should Shekhar come over
and meet the Princess...

118
00:16:24,724 --> 00:16:29,354
the marriage could soon be fixed.
- Tell the King...

119
00:16:29,963 --> 00:16:32,431
Shekhar will surely marry
the Princess.

120
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:38,104
It's our duty to fulfill the
promise Shekhar's father made.

121
00:16:39,472 --> 00:16:42,805
But Shekhar is leaving for Kashmir
for some important work.

122
00:16:43,643 --> 00:16:45,873
You may therefore await him
on the 15th of January.

123
00:16:46,713 --> 00:16:53,118
15th of January...? Could we
advance the date by a few days?

124
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:59,322
Once we have decided, we do not
advance things in our family.

125
00:17:00,026 --> 00:17:02,187
The date shall remain unchanged.

126
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:07,094
It's a custom in our family
not to return without giving a gift.

127
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:09,833
My father has therefore
sent this sword for Shekhar.

128
00:17:10,337 --> 00:17:11,031
Please accept this.

129
00:17:13,406 --> 00:17:18,036
It's not our custom either to let
the bearer of a gift go empty-handed.

130
00:17:19,412 --> 00:17:22,313
Please give this necklace to
the princess on my behalf.

131
00:17:23,216 --> 00:17:27,653
And distribute the money among the
poor as a gift from the Princess.

132
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:29,854
As you wish.

133
00:17:37,464 --> 00:17:40,695
I forget... how much do we owe you?
- 40,000 Rupees.

134
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:44,725
Here you are. You will get the rest
after the marriage.

135
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:47,472
Only 4000?
- How about me?

136
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:51,741
Here you are. The rest of it...
- After the marriage?

137
00:17:52,445 --> 00:17:54,470
And when is the wedding?
- On the 15th of January.

138
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:59,180
Remember the date. If you don't
repay every penny by then...

139
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:02,445
we'll be the worst yet.
- Why get worked up?

140
00:18:02,822 --> 00:18:07,486
I'm a Prince too. Your debt,
I will clear. Sooner or later.

141
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:13,731
Keep this for the time being.
...and you take this.

142
00:18:15,201 --> 00:18:16,998
Hey mister... at least
return my wrist-watch!

143
00:18:17,704 --> 00:18:29,775
Here's your necklace.
I might need it again.

144
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:33,077
The rest of your money
I'll pay after the wedding.

145
00:18:36,423 --> 00:18:41,156
How much did the sword sell for?
- Hats off, Dad!

146
00:18:41,895 --> 00:18:44,227
That idea of the sword really worked.
- Wasn't that a genius touch?

147
00:18:44,497 --> 00:18:45,759
My father, after all.

148
00:18:46,566 --> 00:18:50,696
Even before the wedding,
they give us gifts worth 25000.

149
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,196
Imagine how much of money
the family must have!

150
00:18:54,574 --> 00:18:57,134
The wedding has been fixed
for the 15th of January.

151
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,774
Our worries end once that happens!

152
00:19:00,246 --> 00:19:02,373
15th of January?
- Yes. The 15th of January.

153
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,445
Will our creditors remain
silent till then?

154
00:19:06,052 --> 00:19:09,283
I've silenced them for the time being.
And look at this.

155
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:12,790
Shekhar's mother has sent
this necklace for you.

156
00:19:24,971 --> 00:19:26,131
It's beautiful!

157
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,308
I wonder how many necklaces
I'll get after the wedding.

158
00:19:29,676 --> 00:19:31,803
May I see it?
- Sure.

159
00:19:35,014 --> 00:19:37,380
It can't be worth less than 15000.

160
00:19:39,085 --> 00:19:41,553
I'll keep that necklace, father.
- No!

161
00:19:42,355 --> 00:19:44,380
As your father, I have
every right to it.

162
00:19:45,758 --> 00:19:48,659
Haven't you kept some
money for yourself?

163
00:19:49,596 --> 00:19:52,588
I'm going to lose it if either of
you has it. I'll keep it with me.

164
00:19:52,866 --> 00:19:57,200
See?
- What she says is right.

165
00:19:58,004 --> 00:20:00,564
If the wedding does not take place,
we'll land in prison.

166
00:20:09,148 --> 00:20:12,914
For need of funds, several
companies have closed down.

167
00:20:14,187 --> 00:20:18,624
I have summoned you here to apprise
you of the condition of our company.

168
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:22,318
Do you know what state
our company is in?

169
00:20:22,795 --> 00:20:24,194
Yes.
- My foot!

170
00:20:24,564 --> 00:20:28,125
In view of our condition, I have
decided to give all of you a 3-month...

171
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:35,437
A 3-month notice?
- Without the job, we're dead.

172
00:20:36,376 --> 00:20:38,401
I'm busy.
Call me after 2 minutes.

173
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:43,776
So where was I? Do you know what
state our company is in?

174
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,940
Well...
- You will never know.

175
00:20:46,886 --> 00:20:51,323
In view of our condition, I've decided
to give all of you a 3-month bonus.

176
00:21:07,473 --> 00:21:12,775
I have decided to open an office.
I might have to go there.

177
00:21:19,586 --> 00:21:23,386
Where's your turban? Your turban?
- I'll get it at once, sir!

178
00:21:26,593 --> 00:21:31,587
Insolent man! I'll kill him!

179
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:40,768
The turban, sir.
- On the head. Go on!

180
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:44,371
Put it on the head!

181
00:22:00,226 --> 00:22:06,062
Whenever you serve us, make sure
you're wearing the turban.

182
00:22:06,566 --> 00:22:08,898
Or we can't digest the food.
Understand?

183
00:22:14,007 --> 00:22:20,742
Mala, suppose I told your mother
that you and I are man and wife...

184
00:22:21,314 --> 00:22:23,475
what will happen?
- Nothing.

185
00:22:24,283 --> 00:22:27,844
There'll be a gunshot.
And you'll lay suffering.

186
00:22:29,088 --> 00:22:30,680
Because I'm a poor man?

187
00:22:32,258 --> 00:22:37,355
I wish I were a millionaire! I wish
I had a bungalow and servants...

188
00:22:38,064 --> 00:22:40,294
I'd say it loudly...
"Mala is mine"

189
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:42,066
Mala is mine!

190
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:48,930
Jeevan, what are you up to?
- Stretching exercises, dad.

191
00:22:49,442 --> 00:22:54,209
Mind what exercises you do.
Lest you stretch out too far.

192
00:22:55,014 --> 00:22:57,574
Maybe you'll never regain
your breath again. Understand?

193
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:18,794
Well? What do you want to say?

194
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:24,169
Mala is going astray.

195
00:23:25,745 --> 00:23:31,047
I mean, she's still very young.
- We don't keep a count of age.

196
00:23:32,185 --> 00:23:34,779
After the age of 5, children
and old men are all alike.

197
00:23:35,388 --> 00:23:37,515
State clearly what you
are trying to tell us.

198
00:23:38,991 --> 00:23:41,892
Your sister is treading on
grounds not worthy of her status.

199
00:23:43,262 --> 00:23:48,222
She has fallen in love with someone.
- Love? In our family?

200
00:23:49,702 --> 00:23:53,604
We can forgive anything.
But this crime we will never condone.

201
00:23:54,173 --> 00:23:56,334
Who is it?
Tell me the name!

202
00:23:56,709 --> 00:24:01,476
Your father had laid down
certain rules in the family.

203
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:06,382
He said we must not keep anything
a secret. We must reveal it.

204
00:24:06,886 --> 00:24:09,116
But we must take no names,
lest it be considered a complaint.

205
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,080
You will have to tell us the name.

206
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:18,961
Do I have the permission? Am I to
break the rules of this family?

207
00:24:20,233 --> 00:24:26,502
Not till I live will you break
the laws laid down by your father.

208
00:24:27,106 --> 00:24:28,801
So how are we going
to decide this?

209
00:24:29,742 --> 00:24:32,836
The onus of taking a decision lies
with the one who reveals the secret.

210
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,245
Manager...
- Very well, madam.

211
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:46,524
You are going to Kashmir in any case.
You had better take Malaji along too.

212
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,686
And advance the trip to an earlier date.
- How early?

213
00:24:52,265 --> 00:24:55,598
Say the day after tomorrow?
- Oh no. We leave tomorrow!

214
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:08,176
Having spent a few months in Kashmir,
Mala will forget all this. For sure.

215
00:25:08,681 --> 00:25:10,239
Who has asked you for an explanation?

216
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:13,448
Keep words to a minimum when
you say something to us.

217
00:25:18,524 --> 00:25:19,991
Have you called me?

218
00:25:21,594 --> 00:25:26,554
Manager, book two tickets on the
flight to Kashmir tomorrow morning.

219
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:29,293
Mala and Shekhar are going there.
- Kashmir?

220
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:34,763
Kashmir. 200 miles away from Jammu.
- But why will I go there?

221
00:25:35,241 --> 00:25:36,401
Have I gone out of my mind?

222
00:25:38,211 --> 00:25:41,544
People from all over the world go to
Kashmir. Are they out of their minds?

223
00:25:42,481 --> 00:25:46,679
But what wrong have I done? Tell me!
This is a personal affair!

224
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,482
I wish there isn't
a sunset tomorrow!

225
00:26:28,194 --> 00:26:30,992
What is it?
- Mr. Shekhar is waiting for you.

226
00:26:31,697 --> 00:26:34,063
What for?
- We're going sight-seeing.

227
00:26:34,967 --> 00:26:39,063
Tell him that I'm not going anywhere.
- Kashmir's a place...

228
00:26:39,572 --> 00:26:44,202
aptly described by a poet. "If there
be a heaven anywhere on this earth..."

229
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:46,843
"it is here, here, here"

230
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:51,549
What if the heavens
all turned into hell?

231
00:26:52,585 --> 00:26:55,816
What if the snow catches fire
and flowers take to the feet...

232
00:26:56,722 --> 00:26:59,520
with just one voice resonating?
- What voice?

233
00:26:59,692 --> 00:27:07,531
"Run away! Shekhar is here!
Escape from Shekhar"

234
00:27:51,877 --> 00:27:53,674
Insolent girl! Why did you
throw a stone at me?

235
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,716
Wasn't a stone. It was a snowball.
- All right. Why did you throw it?

236
00:27:58,084 --> 00:28:00,245
It was intended for the monkey
but it hit you.

237
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:02,644
Please forgive me.
- Forgive you, my foot!

238
00:28:03,022 --> 00:28:05,047
Looks like your parents have
taught you no manners.

239
00:28:08,828 --> 00:28:11,388
I made sure when I flung it.
- So how did it hit me?

240
00:28:11,864 --> 00:28:16,324
Oh yes. It must've been confused
between you and the monkey.

241
00:28:16,702 --> 00:28:22,004
Do I look like a monkey to you?
- How can I say that to your face?

242
00:28:22,508 --> 00:28:26,035
You'd think I'm praising you.
- Insolent girl! Wait till I...

243
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,663
I told you not to mess with monkeys.
It has bitten you now, hasn't it?

244
00:29:26,472 --> 00:29:30,568
I ran into an ape today.
- An ape?

245
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:35,276
How did it get to Kashmir?
- It has been brought here.

246
00:29:35,881 --> 00:29:38,441
What a waste of money!

247
00:29:39,051 --> 00:29:44,045
They bring an ape to Kashmir?
- To each his own, father.

248
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:50,827
You're wearing the old suit again?
- To each his own, dear.

249
00:29:53,165 --> 00:29:59,229
My doll's getting old, father.
You promised me another, didn't you?

250
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,307
I now want to bring
a monkey into the family.

251
00:30:02,775 --> 00:30:04,800
A monkey? What for?

252
00:30:05,511 --> 00:30:07,877
You're growing up too, aren't you?

253
00:30:08,814 --> 00:30:10,076
Father!

254
00:31:33,032 --> 00:31:36,263
"Go away, O childhood..."

255
00:31:36,735 --> 00:31:39,761
"Go away, elsewhere"

256
00:31:40,606 --> 00:31:43,939
"Go away, O childhood..."

257
00:31:44,343 --> 00:31:47,574
"Go away, elsewhere"

258
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,716
"My journey is now
getting difficult..."

259
00:31:52,084 --> 00:31:55,542
"the storm of youth is
waiting to happen"

260
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:59,186
"Go away, O childhood..."

261
00:31:59,692 --> 00:32:03,025
"Go away, elsewhere"

262
00:32:33,926 --> 00:32:37,487
"Leave me alone, O childhood"

263
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:40,665
"Go away, elsewhere"

264
00:32:41,233 --> 00:32:44,691
"Life is now getting colorful"

265
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:48,198
"Flowers are blossoming"

266
00:32:48,974 --> 00:32:52,102
"Leave me alone, O childhood"

267
00:32:52,478 --> 00:32:55,504
"Go away, elsewhere"

268
00:32:56,081 --> 00:32:59,642
"Life is now getting colorful"

269
00:33:00,152 --> 00:33:02,382
"Flowers are blossoming"

270
00:33:03,122 --> 00:33:06,353
"Leave me alone, O childhood"

271
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:09,857
"Go away elsewhere,
O innocence"

272
00:33:10,896 --> 00:33:14,127
"This journey is now
getting difficult"

273
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,833
"The storm of youth
is waiting to explode"

274
00:33:18,537 --> 00:33:21,995
"Leave me alone, O childhood"

275
00:33:22,274 --> 00:33:25,607
"Go away elsewhere,
O innocence"

276
00:33:45,664 --> 00:33:52,194
"A strange feeling now
overcomes my heart"

277
00:33:53,205 --> 00:33:59,303
"It torments me...
but I love it"

278
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:07,414
"A strange feeling now
overcomes my heart"

279
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:13,756
"It torments me...
but I love it"

280
00:34:14,793 --> 00:34:18,024
"Go away, O childhood"

281
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,861
"Go elsewhere, O innocence"

282
00:34:22,568 --> 00:34:29,497
"My journey's now getting difficult;
a storm is about to happen"

283
00:34:29,975 --> 00:34:33,206
"Go away, O childhood"

284
00:34:33,812 --> 00:34:36,940
"Go elsewhere, O innocence"

285
00:35:07,813 --> 00:35:14,218
"My veil is now beyond my control"

286
00:35:15,254 --> 00:35:21,454
"It flies away with me...
and touches the skies"

287
00:35:22,628 --> 00:35:29,363
"My veil is now beyond my control"

288
00:35:29,968 --> 00:35:35,929
"It flies away with me...
and touches the skies"

289
00:35:36,508 --> 00:35:39,875
"Go away, O childhood"

290
00:35:40,446 --> 00:35:43,472
"Go elsewhere, O innocence"

291
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:47,516
"The journey of life
is now getting difficult"

292
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,251
"A storm breaks out
in my heart"

293
00:35:51,723 --> 00:35:55,056
"Go away, O childhood"

294
00:35:55,427 --> 00:35:58,794
"Go elsewhere, O innocence"

295
00:36:17,887 --> 00:36:21,584
Where's my brother?
- I have telephoned him.

296
00:36:22,058 --> 00:36:25,289
He'll arrive with the doctor any moment.
- Who asked you to telephone him?

297
00:36:25,795 --> 00:36:27,695
You weren't keeping well...
- Bloody ass!

298
00:36:28,297 --> 00:36:30,322
Where are you going, madam?
- To hell!

299
00:36:31,033 --> 00:36:33,831
Please don't go out in this state.
The boss will be angry.

300
00:36:49,518 --> 00:36:51,679
Nothing much. Everything
is normal.

301
00:36:52,688 --> 00:36:57,352
Why do I feel the pain?
- It happens.

302
00:36:58,294 --> 00:37:05,791
3 months more to go.
- What do you mean?

303
00:37:07,136 --> 00:37:09,070
Looks like this is your first baby.

304
00:37:10,539 --> 00:37:12,006
Baby?

305
00:37:15,111 --> 00:37:17,477
What happened?
- Nothing.

306
00:37:18,414 --> 00:37:20,644
Rest for a while and
give me your address.

307
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:24,716
I'll have your brother called here.
- No. I'll go on my own.

308
00:37:24,987 --> 00:37:27,979
Do not be stubborn, dear.
Rest for sometime.

309
00:37:28,357 --> 00:37:30,291
You can leave once
you're feeling better.

310
00:37:31,861 --> 00:37:33,795
What is your brother's name?

311
00:38:34,523 --> 00:38:38,960
Why have you saved me? You ought
to have let me die.

312
00:38:40,329 --> 00:38:43,560
Oh yes that was a mistake.
Come along, and die.

313
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:47,067
Stop joking. How long will
the truth be hidden.

314
00:38:47,436 --> 00:38:48,801
Till I am alive.

315
00:38:49,605 --> 00:38:52,631
You don't know my folks.

316
00:38:53,576 --> 00:38:56,807
My brother won't let me live.
- And I won't let you die.

317
00:38:57,613 --> 00:39:01,947
Why is your brother staying?
- At the guest house in Gulmarg.

318
00:39:02,651 --> 00:39:07,088
I see. It isn't for you
to handle him.

319
00:39:07,456 --> 00:39:11,256
But I'll straighten out
your brother. Just you see.

320
00:39:27,076 --> 00:39:28,543
Any news?
- No sir.

321
00:39:29,712 --> 00:39:32,078
What had I told you?
Don't stare at me!

322
00:39:32,648 --> 00:39:34,809
Find out where she is!
Go on!

323
00:39:36,385 --> 00:39:37,409
May I come in?

324
00:39:39,755 --> 00:39:40,813
Him?

325
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:42,887
Why have you come here?

326
00:39:43,492 --> 00:39:46,620
I'm so much in love with you...

327
00:39:47,229 --> 00:39:50,562
that I feel like looking at your
handsome face again and again.

328
00:39:52,468 --> 00:39:55,164
As for your smile... my God!

329
00:39:56,071 --> 00:39:57,868
You must be quite
a lady-killer.

330
00:39:58,707 --> 00:40:00,174
Get out! Else, I'll drown you
in the lake!

331
00:40:00,776 --> 00:40:05,213
Deadly manners, all right! But
could you repeat what you just said?

332
00:40:06,348 --> 00:40:09,681
Aliju! Throw this mad girl
out of the house!

333
00:40:12,154 --> 00:40:15,715
Aliju! Send that madman
to the institution in Agra!

334
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,926
He doesn't even know that
his sister had passed out...

335
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,863
and was about to die. I took mercy
on her and took her to the hospital.

336
00:40:29,004 --> 00:40:33,100
Ask this mad girl which hospital
my sister is in!

337
00:40:34,577 --> 00:40:36,807
Tell the madman to first learn
how to treat women!

338
00:40:40,082 --> 00:40:42,550
It isn't visiting hours.
- What time then?

339
00:40:43,352 --> 00:40:47,254
At 4 p.m. Ask him to be at
Chinar Baug at four.

340
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,952
Rajkumari will wait for him.
- Rajkumari (Princess)?

341
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,688
Which state are you a princess of?
- I'm no princess.

342
00:40:55,164 --> 00:40:56,426
My name itself is Rajkumari.

343
00:40:58,567 --> 00:41:02,230
She's no princess, sir...
- Aliju! Get out!

344
00:41:13,649 --> 00:41:16,345
What is it?
- Flowers. Beautiful flowers.

345
00:41:16,819 --> 00:41:20,186
I don't like flowers.
- Buy some for your sister.

346
00:41:20,422 --> 00:41:23,448
Whoever they're for, I hate flowers!
- Think it over.

347
00:41:24,593 --> 00:41:27,824
You have the opportunity... and that
is what keeps the world going.

348
00:41:28,297 --> 00:41:29,594
No!
- No?

349
00:41:30,399 --> 00:41:32,094
All right. I'll sit here then.

350
00:42:00,696 --> 00:42:03,062
Come with me without any fuss.
Or show me the way to the hospital

351
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:04,562
The flowers...

352
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:08,625
The rose! Not you!

353
00:42:11,507 --> 00:42:13,202
Give me some flowers! Hurry!

354
00:42:20,582 --> 00:42:23,380
Mala, you are yourself responsible
for what you have done.

355
00:42:23,886 --> 00:42:26,354
Had you listened to me, you
wouldn't have to see this day!

356
00:42:27,056 --> 00:42:34,326
Flowers for you.
- You brought flowers, brother!

357
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:37,396
Your brother seems to be an expert
at picking flowers.

358
00:42:37,967 --> 00:42:40,231
Look at the beautiful flowers
he has chosen for you.

359
00:42:40,936 --> 00:42:44,838
Lovely flowers.
- I'm sure he was a gardener...

360
00:42:45,207 --> 00:42:46,697
in his earlier birth.
- Nonsense!

361
00:42:48,477 --> 00:42:51,071
What has happened to you, Mala?
When will you recover?

362
00:42:51,547 --> 00:42:56,644
We'd have to ask the doctor.
- Where is he?

363
00:42:57,019 --> 00:42:59,146
He's out...

364
00:42:59,321 --> 00:43:02,222
in the other room.

365
00:43:07,529 --> 00:43:10,430
I'm now convinced you will
straighten out my brother.

366
00:43:11,233 --> 00:43:14,464
Not just one. I'd straighten out
a dozen of them.

367
00:43:14,837 --> 00:43:18,534
No. You must straighten out just one.
- Why?

368
00:43:18,907 --> 00:43:23,970
You can love only one man.
- Love? That stone?

369
00:43:25,581 --> 00:43:28,675
You could melt the stone
if you wish to.

370
00:43:33,555 --> 00:43:36,786
You haven't told me how much
time she will take to recover?

371
00:43:37,826 --> 00:43:41,262
She's very weak. It could
take a month, or even three.

372
00:43:41,764 --> 00:43:43,129
What could have
caused the weakness?

373
00:43:46,668 --> 00:43:51,537
You forgot what is
most necessary in life.

374
00:43:52,474 --> 00:43:54,704
Two vital ingredients:
Laughter and happiness.

375
00:43:55,411 --> 00:43:57,345
Here you are.

376
00:44:03,952 --> 00:44:06,216
2000 Rupees. My sister
should have no trouble.

377
00:44:07,456 --> 00:44:11,790
Why are you paying me so much?
I will need just 500 Rupees.

378
00:44:12,594 --> 00:44:14,528
Please take back the
rest of the money.

379
00:44:16,198 --> 00:44:18,462
I don't take back what
I have given away, doctor.

380
00:44:28,577 --> 00:44:31,808
Mala, the doctor has told me everything.
- Everything?

381
00:44:33,282 --> 00:44:36,513
Yes. He says you're weak.
But you will be all right.

382
00:44:37,753 --> 00:44:41,985
Please don't write to Mom.
She might panic and rush here.

383
00:44:42,224 --> 00:44:45,250
I can't waste my precious time
writing silly letters.

384
00:44:45,627 --> 00:44:48,755
I'm leaving. See you tomorrow morning.
- I've told you...

385
00:44:49,031 --> 00:44:53,559
you're not allowed before 4 p.m.
- Mala, this girl...

386
00:44:55,571 --> 00:44:59,473
this girl is a fly, Mala!
She's always flitting around!

387
00:44:59,842 --> 00:45:03,972
I don't like her company at all!
- She has saved my life.

388
00:45:04,446 --> 00:45:07,779
Your life she has saved.
And mine, she will claim!

389
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:09,312
Get rid of her!

390
00:45:09,685 --> 00:45:11,846
I'm leaving. I don't want to see
this girl here tomorrow. Okay?

391
00:45:12,321 --> 00:45:14,585
See you.
- At 4 p.m.

392
00:46:05,274 --> 00:46:10,234
You're here again!
- Flies, you see.

393
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:14,941
They always come back.
But you aren't angry to see me today.

394
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:18,349
You wear the same jovial look,
and talk so sweetly.

395
00:46:21,456 --> 00:46:24,118
Which girl wouldn't die
for such simplicity?

396
00:46:24,826 --> 00:46:27,090
He slays without a sword!

397
00:46:32,067 --> 00:46:34,627
How will I go? My feet are aching!
- Why ask me?

398
00:46:35,103 --> 00:46:37,264
You didn't ask me before coming!
- No one in this world...

399
00:46:37,506 --> 00:46:39,872
seeks permission
before coming or going.

400
00:47:03,865 --> 00:47:06,425
"I'm a budding flower in Kashmir"

401
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:09,170
"Do not be angry with me"

402
00:47:09,671 --> 00:47:12,469
"I'd never blossom
if I withered away..."

403
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:14,869
"Never, never, never again"

404
00:47:26,655 --> 00:47:31,854
"I'm a bud in Kashmir;
do not be angry with me"

405
00:47:32,327 --> 00:47:34,921
"I'd never blossom
if I were to wither away..."

406
00:47:35,297 --> 00:47:37,629
"Never, never, never again"

407
00:48:01,423 --> 00:48:04,119
"My heavens lie
in the Spring"

408
00:48:04,393 --> 00:48:06,725
"A fire but rages in my heart"

409
00:48:07,095 --> 00:48:09,461
"My heavens lie
in the Spring"

410
00:48:09,831 --> 00:48:12,299
"A fire but rages in my heart"

411
00:48:12,734 --> 00:48:15,100
"Say something to me..."

412
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:17,702
"so I like it
among the roses"

413
00:48:18,073 --> 00:48:20,439
"Say something to me..."

414
00:48:20,809 --> 00:48:23,300
"so I like it
among the roses"

415
00:48:23,779 --> 00:48:28,739
"I'm a bud in Kashmir...
do not be angry with me"

416
00:48:29,251 --> 00:48:31,811
"I'd never blossom if
I were to shrivel"

417
00:48:32,087 --> 00:48:34,351
"Never, never, never again"

418
00:48:52,441 --> 00:48:54,466
"You're angry with me,
because I love you"

419
00:48:54,843 --> 00:48:57,539
"But I love your temper too"

420
00:48:57,913 --> 00:49:00,177
"You're angry with me,
because I love you"

421
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:03,009
"But I love your temper too"

422
00:49:03,552 --> 00:49:14,121
"This sure is killer-stuff...
it has felled me"

423
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:19,793
"I'm a bud in Kashmir...
do not be angry with me"

424
00:49:20,302 --> 00:49:22,964
"I'd never blossom if
I were to shrivel"

425
00:49:23,238 --> 00:49:25,502
"Never, never, never"

426
00:49:37,352 --> 00:49:42,551
"I'm a bud in Kashmir...
do not be angry with me"

427
00:49:43,058 --> 00:49:45,618
"I'd never blossom if
I were to shrivel"

428
00:49:45,994 --> 00:49:48,360
"Never, never, never"

429
00:50:11,987 --> 00:50:22,795
"Forget your anger;
Break the silence"

430
00:50:23,365 --> 00:50:34,037
"What state I'm going through,
you will never understand"

431
00:50:34,643 --> 00:50:39,842
"I'm a bud in Kashmir,
do not vent your anger on me"

432
00:50:40,449 --> 00:50:42,917
"If I were to wilt,
I'd never blossom again"

433
00:50:43,285 --> 00:50:45,651
"Oh no, never again"

434
00:50:57,332 --> 00:51:02,861
"I'm a bud in Kashmir,
do not vent your anger on me"

435
00:51:03,338 --> 00:51:05,932
"If I were to wilt,
I'd never blossom again"

436
00:51:06,308 --> 00:51:08,776
"Oh no, never again"

437
00:51:11,046 --> 00:51:13,310
Help!

438
00:51:22,557 --> 00:51:25,822
I'm coming!

439
00:51:28,697 --> 00:51:30,289
Help!

440
00:51:59,507 --> 00:52:02,874
No need to worry. The problem will
be over in a couple of days.

441
00:52:03,244 --> 00:52:06,236
Have you no way of telling whether
she'll bear a baby boy or a baby girl?

442
00:52:08,249 --> 00:52:11,082
You don't know
what to say and when.

443
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:14,252
I think we ought to
lock the lion into its den.

444
00:52:14,823 --> 00:52:18,725
He's a mosquito, daddy.
But why send him away?

445
00:52:18,993 --> 00:52:22,121
Because we can't hide
Mala's condition anymore

446
00:52:22,497 --> 00:52:26,365
Sooner or later, Shekhar will
discover. What happens then?

447
00:52:26,534 --> 00:52:29,332
My brother is a strange man, doctor.

448
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:35,907
If he's asked not to do something,
he'd leave everything to go after that.

449
00:52:43,418 --> 00:52:50,153
Lion or crow...
I've have him where I want him!

450
00:52:52,427 --> 00:52:55,225
My child! Listen!

451
00:53:03,905 --> 00:53:05,736
My child...
- Child?

452
00:53:06,107 --> 00:53:08,769
Aren't you ashamed to call
a grown up man, a child?

453
00:53:09,711 --> 00:53:13,477
We don't take offense at what
people in the world say, my child.

454
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:16,450
Child again! I could be
your father, understand?

455
00:53:16,918 --> 00:53:20,376
But I consider you no older
than a teething baby.

456
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:23,783
Hey midget! Why invite trouble
so early in the day?

457
00:53:24,259 --> 00:53:26,056
I'm here to warn you, my child.

458
00:53:26,761 --> 00:53:29,992
Your sister's stars are
at loggerheads.

459
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,197
She's seriously ill.

460
00:53:33,334 --> 00:53:37,236
Do not try to hide it from me...
or you will go blind!

461
00:53:37,806 --> 00:53:41,936
How do you know?
- Calm down, my child.

462
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:45,302
Your stars are fighting
between themselves too.

463
00:53:46,147 --> 00:53:49,139
There's this girl who keeps
haunting you all the time.

464
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:53,309
Remember, she's going to make you
eat out of her hands.

465
00:53:53,788 --> 00:53:57,121
That's impossible!
- Do you want to fight God?

466
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,289
So what's going to happen?

467
00:54:01,563 --> 00:54:04,691
Let me have some money.
I'll give you a solution, my child.

468
00:54:08,436 --> 00:54:10,802
Not this much!
I want only Rs. 1.25

469
00:54:18,179 --> 00:54:20,113
That's like a good boy.

470
00:54:20,815 --> 00:54:24,717
Now listen. You will have to
go to Sheshnag, my child.

471
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:31,252
In the old temple there, you will
have to pray for 15 days.

472
00:54:31,759 --> 00:54:35,195
What happens then, Holy Sire?
- You will be redeemed, my child.

473
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:37,588
Here I go then!
- Wait... where to?

474
00:54:38,299 --> 00:54:39,698
Pay your respects to this first.

475
00:54:44,105 --> 00:54:46,039
You now have it made, my child!

476
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:54,876
Lion or crow, I have him
where I want him!

477
00:54:57,886 --> 00:55:06,692
My child! Sit up!

478
00:55:06,861 --> 00:55:08,226
You have it made, my child!

479
00:55:09,163 --> 00:55:14,897
Where is the doctor?
- He's away the big hospital.

480
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:17,861
The big hospital?
What for?

481
00:55:18,339 --> 00:55:23,003
Sheshnag is said to be reeling
under a severe storm.

482
00:55:23,478 --> 00:55:27,574
A lot of people have died.
- God! How could this happen?

483
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:32,844
Raj! Listen!

484
00:55:48,202 --> 00:55:53,731
My child! Stop there!
There's danger ahead.

485
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:59,636
Holy Sire! Is that really you?
Or is your voice echoing in my ears?

486
00:56:00,248 --> 00:56:05,550
I'm always with you, my child.
- So why don't you come before me?

487
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,912
I will, when the need arises.

488
00:56:09,857 --> 00:56:12,417
Right now, you can only
listen to my voice.

489
00:56:13,027 --> 00:56:15,052
Do not go to Sheshnag now.

490
00:56:15,763 --> 00:56:19,324
The stars foretell that a
storm is going to break out.

491
00:56:20,034 --> 00:56:21,729
Your life is in danger.

492
00:56:22,437 --> 00:56:24,905
Should you venture forth even then,
you will never return.

493
00:56:25,607 --> 00:56:27,302
Return immediately.

494
00:56:30,411 --> 00:56:31,810
So it's you, my child!

495
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:35,941
I'll surely go ahead now!
And you will go with me too!

496
00:56:36,451 --> 00:56:39,249
I will show you the consequences
of playing such a joke!

497
00:56:40,254 --> 00:56:43,951
I'm sorry about that. But there's
really a great storm in Sheshnag.

498
00:56:44,292 --> 00:56:46,021
Please don't go there.
Your life could be in danger.

499
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,751
You aren't letting me live in
peace here anyway! Let's go!

500
00:56:49,897 --> 00:56:52,127
Let go of my hand!
You're a decent man.

501
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,334
You know I can't go with you.

502
00:56:56,004 --> 00:56:59,371
But you can throw snowballs
at a man, can you?

503
00:56:59,841 --> 00:57:02,537
You can make his life miserable...
- Why don't you understand?

504
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:07,577
I'm my father's only daughter.
What would you get out of my death?

505
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,943
So tell me you're a coward!
- Okay, I'm a coward.

506
00:57:11,753 --> 00:57:14,347
My dad's a coward. And my
grandfather was a coward too.

507
00:57:15,156 --> 00:57:16,646
Listen to me, please.

508
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,127
I'll never misbehave again.

509
00:57:20,628 --> 00:57:22,425
Let's return now.
Or the two of us will die.

510
00:57:22,797 --> 00:57:24,822
I beg at your feet.
- Go ahead.

511
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:35,901
Remember! Those who laugh,
also have to cry.

512
00:57:36,577 --> 00:57:38,169
Get it, "my child"?
C'mon!

513
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:35,985
Get up and have some tea.
- Go out first... go on.

514
00:59:45,973 --> 00:59:47,463
I don't want any tea.
I want food.

515
00:59:55,817 --> 00:59:59,480
This is the limit! Aliju hasn't
packed any spoons with the food!

516
01:00:00,087 --> 01:00:02,783
What do you want to eat?
The food? Or the spoons and plates?

517
01:00:03,491 --> 01:00:06,483
You're misbehaving again?
I won't eat with you!

518
01:00:07,428 --> 01:00:09,555
Don't. I'm hungry.
I'm going to eat.

519
01:00:10,498 --> 01:00:15,265
Why stand there and look at me?
Eat, if you're hungry.

520
01:00:15,837 --> 01:00:18,101
Do you think I'll die
if I don't eat for a day?

521
01:00:18,706 --> 01:00:22,142
Chances of surviving are bleak.
Death is more likely.

522
01:00:27,315 --> 01:00:28,612
Wow! Great pancakes!

523
01:00:36,858 --> 01:00:39,088
This potato-dish...
it's fantastic!

524
01:00:41,762 --> 01:00:42,922
Pickles?!

525
01:00:43,965 --> 01:00:45,660
Wow!

526
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:04,050
I think I could die for this.

527
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:08,285
Do you mean it? Aren't you
really going to eat anything?

528
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:15,193
If not any food, have a chili
and drink some water.

529
01:01:33,614 --> 01:01:36,845
Good God! What ways
of the gentleman!

530
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:41,884
They will starve to death,
but dine in style.

531
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:51,731
Who asked you for your opinion?
- I was talking to God.

532
01:01:52,633 --> 01:01:54,464
All right. You'd better
take some rest now.

533
01:03:06,974 --> 01:03:08,373
Poor guy.

534
01:03:17,051 --> 01:03:20,851
Thanks a million, God! You have
finally shown him the truth.

535
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:24,216
Spare the food now.

536
01:03:24,725 --> 01:03:28,252
There's no saying how many days
we'll have to spend in the storm here.

537
01:03:30,064 --> 01:03:32,430
So eat less, and
have more water.

538
01:03:33,034 --> 01:03:36,800
Where did you pick up
that word from?

539
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:57,583
"What havoc this sight
of the morning wreaks"

540
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:02,811
"Her pillow lies somewhere,
her hair is scattered..."

541
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:04,682
"and she's oblivious of her beauty"

542
01:06:09,957 --> 01:06:11,424
Have you gone crazy?

543
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:14,288
I was afraid, I'd go crazy.

544
01:06:14,528 --> 01:06:16,359
You went out in that storm?

545
01:06:16,964 --> 01:06:19,762
I'm already surrounded by
a storm which I can't escape.

546
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,561
I know.
- You don't know anything.

547
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:31,343
You say you're a brave man.
And you can't survive a storm?

548
01:06:32,813 --> 01:06:34,940
That's what I'm trying to do.
- What?

549
01:06:35,649 --> 01:06:38,447
Go away, please. I'm not
not used to such things.

550
01:06:38,819 --> 01:06:39,751
What things?

551
01:06:42,323 --> 01:06:44,587
What will my mother say!
- What?

552
01:06:46,594 --> 01:06:49,825
You can explain that nobody
can prevent a storm.

553
01:06:50,197 --> 01:06:52,665
We were caught together.
What could we die? Die?

554
01:06:53,033 --> 01:06:55,058
Go away! You're so childish!

555
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:05,805
What are you reading?

556
01:07:08,148 --> 01:07:12,050
Poetry.
- Poetry? You! Great!

557
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:19,687
That there were so many storms
in my heart... I didn't ever know.

558
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,958
Does the book say that?
- Yes.

559
01:07:24,865 --> 01:07:26,127
Here's a couplet.

560
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:31,737
"She now reads what's
written in my heart"

561
01:07:33,941 --> 01:07:37,399
"She now reads what's
in my heart..."

562
01:07:38,646 --> 01:07:42,104
"in every sentence she
finds the word love"

563
01:07:42,483 --> 01:07:43,541
Wonderful!

564
01:07:47,254 --> 01:07:51,452
Here's another couplet.
Very well written.

565
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:57,023
Somewhat like the storm outside.

566
01:07:59,933 --> 01:08:07,101
"Do the gushing winds get
their strength from the storm?"

567
01:08:08,242 --> 01:08:11,905
"Do the gushing winds get their
strength from the storm?"

568
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:17,814
"Or is it because you are
beautiful... and I'm passionate"

569
01:08:39,973 --> 01:08:46,811
"Love and beauty often cause a fire"

570
01:08:47,848 --> 01:08:50,510
"Whenever the flames leap..."

571
01:08:51,452 --> 01:08:54,353
"the fire-fly gets
burnt in the fires"

572
01:08:57,358 --> 01:08:59,485
I used to hate this girl
till yesterday.

573
01:09:00,661 --> 01:09:08,693
But she's so beautiful,
so innocent, so naive...

574
01:09:09,203 --> 01:09:15,608
Till yesterday I took him for a beast.
And now... what am I feeling for him?

575
01:09:17,478 --> 01:09:19,844
Is this how love happens?

576
01:09:22,516 --> 01:09:25,644
Is a cruel man like him
capable of loving?

577
01:09:27,888 --> 01:09:32,552
I end up falling in love
with the one who tormented me?

578
01:09:34,461 --> 01:09:36,827
Love? This stone-hearted man?

579
01:09:38,499 --> 01:09:42,060
But I could melt
this stone-hearted man.

580
01:09:44,171 --> 01:09:53,773
Those eyes could
surely do things to me.

581
01:10:10,097 --> 01:10:12,122
What injustice!

582
01:10:13,367 --> 01:10:16,734
Great pancakes!

583
01:10:21,375 --> 01:10:22,865
Pickles!

584
01:10:25,078 --> 01:10:28,206
I could die for this food!
- Let me have some...

585
01:10:28,482 --> 01:10:31,940
The storm is not to be trusted.

586
01:10:32,519 --> 01:10:35,647
Go slow on the food,
and have lots of water.

587
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:38,385
Water?
- Nonsense!

588
01:10:39,526 --> 01:10:42,086
Where did you pick up that word?

589
01:10:42,596 --> 01:10:44,621
I'm terribly hungry!
- Really?

590
01:10:45,332 --> 01:10:50,099
Have a chili.
- Don't misbehave! Give that to me.

591
01:10:51,238 --> 01:10:54,230
Is that a request, or an order?
- It's an order.

592
01:11:44,958 --> 01:11:48,485
Looks like this storm
is going to claim our lives.

593
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:52,224
And I will never forgive myself...

594
01:11:52,499 --> 01:11:54,399
for you will lose your life
because of me.

595
01:11:54,668 --> 01:11:57,466
No. It isn't your mistake.
It's mine.

596
01:11:58,071 --> 01:12:00,096
No...

597
01:12:27,701 --> 01:12:28,759
God...

598
01:12:29,903 --> 01:12:33,134
You have given me everything,
except love.

599
01:12:34,708 --> 01:12:37,404
It isn't right for You to take it back,
now that You have given it to me.

600
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:39,904
Save Raj, Lord...

601
01:12:40,514 --> 01:12:44,712
Stop this storm. I swear, I will
seek nothing from You ever again.

602
01:12:45,218 --> 01:12:46,810
I will seek nothing again.

603
01:13:29,596 --> 01:13:32,429
"Call me a beast, if you will"

604
01:13:33,233 --> 01:13:35,793
"Call me whatever you will"

605
01:13:36,503 --> 01:13:42,373
"I'm caught in a storm of love...
what can I do?"

606
01:13:43,076 --> 01:13:45,442
"Call me a beast, if you will"

607
01:13:46,246 --> 01:13:48,612
"Call me whatever you will"

608
01:13:49,516 --> 01:13:55,477
"I'm caught in a storm of love...
what can I do?"

609
01:13:56,123 --> 01:13:58,591
"Call me a beast, if you will"

610
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:28,552
"I have a heart too.
And I have some desires"

611
01:14:28,922 --> 01:14:35,225
"I'm not stone-hearted...
I'm human too"

612
01:14:35,696 --> 01:14:41,760
"I have a heart too.
And I have some desires"

613
01:14:42,135 --> 01:14:48,335
"I'm not stone-hearted...
I'm human too"

614
01:14:48,608 --> 01:15:01,453
"I follow the path
the world has trodden"

615
01:15:01,955 --> 01:15:04,515
"Call me a beast"

616
01:15:05,125 --> 01:15:07,821
"Call me whatever you will"

617
01:15:08,495 --> 01:15:14,365
"I'm caught in a storm of love...
what can I do?"

618
01:15:15,135 --> 01:15:18,070
"Call me a beast"

619
01:15:38,225 --> 01:15:44,528
"For ages, this storm
was suppressed in my heart"

620
01:15:44,898 --> 01:15:47,924
"How can I hide it anymore..."

621
01:15:48,168 --> 01:15:51,194
"now that our eyes meet?"

622
01:15:51,705 --> 01:15:57,769
"For ages, this storm
was suppressed in my heart"

623
01:15:58,245 --> 01:16:01,180
"How can I hide it anymore..."

624
01:16:01,548 --> 01:16:04,449
"now that our eyes meet?"

625
01:16:04,818 --> 01:16:07,844
"How can I be patient anymore?"

626
01:16:08,221 --> 01:16:11,019
"Why should I be
scared of anyone?"

627
01:16:11,525 --> 01:16:14,517
"How can I be patient anymore?"

628
01:16:14,895 --> 01:16:17,830
"Why should I be
scared of anyone?"

629
01:16:18,198 --> 01:16:20,666
"Call me a beast, if you will"

630
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:23,928
"Call me whatever you will"

631
01:16:24,738 --> 01:16:30,699
"I'm caught in a storm of love...
what can I do?"

632
01:16:31,478 --> 01:16:34,276
"Call me a beast, if you will"

633
01:16:57,838 --> 01:17:01,069
"I take a deep breath..."

634
01:17:01,341 --> 01:17:04,139
"and I wonder what fire this is"

635
01:17:04,611 --> 01:17:10,709
"Life has woken up
from its deep slumber"

636
01:17:11,251 --> 01:17:14,277
"I take a deep breath..."

637
01:17:14,554 --> 01:17:17,682
"and I wonder what fire this is"

638
01:17:17,924 --> 01:17:24,124
"Life has woken up
from its deep slumber"

639
01:17:24,497 --> 01:17:27,625
"It's me all the way..."

640
01:17:28,001 --> 01:17:30,902
"like the skies"

641
01:17:31,238 --> 01:17:34,230
"It's me all the way..."

642
01:17:34,507 --> 01:17:37,305
"like the skies"

643
01:17:37,777 --> 01:17:40,371
"Call me a beast, if you will"

644
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:43,718
"Call me whatever you will"

645
01:17:44,423 --> 01:17:50,191
"I'm caught in a storm of love...
what can I do?"

646
01:17:51,063 --> 01:17:53,531
"Call me a beast, if you will"

647
01:17:54,333 --> 01:17:57,131
"Call me whatever you will"

648
01:17:57,503 --> 01:18:03,601
"I'm caught in a storm of love...
what can I do?"

649
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:07,108
"Call me a beast, if you will"

650
01:18:21,672 --> 01:18:27,008
Is this the way we came, Shekhar?
- It is. But it has another name now.

651
01:18:28,346 --> 01:18:32,339
When we set out, it was with hatred.
And now we're in love.

652
01:18:33,484 --> 01:18:36,851
I don't know why I'm scared.
I wish I could fly home.

653
01:18:38,189 --> 01:18:40,783
I'm doing my best to
keep you in good spirits.

654
01:18:41,259 --> 01:18:43,284
What do I make of my mood then?

655
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:46,696
You must realize that
when you are in love...

656
01:18:47,064 --> 01:18:52,798
your anxiety gets worse
when you try to relax.

657
01:19:00,411 --> 01:19:03,642
That temple there is one of
the most famous shrines of Kashmir.

658
01:19:04,015 --> 01:19:07,781
Really?
- You get whatever you pray for.

659
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:10,720
God has given me
what He had to.

660
01:19:11,289 --> 01:19:14,656
What does He have now?
- You say such things for God?

661
01:19:15,126 --> 01:19:16,286
Are you drunk?

662
01:19:18,963 --> 01:19:22,956
I'm drunk on your charms...
and you ask me if I'm drunk?

663
01:19:28,039 --> 01:19:34,444
Those eyes of yours hold all
the intoxication of wine.

664
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:37,607
So I'll shut my eyes.

665
01:19:44,222 --> 01:19:47,589
Her lips are so tender...
they're like rose-petals.

666
01:19:57,368 --> 01:20:00,804
I couldn't even imagine you'd
change into such an interesting man.

667
01:20:01,072 --> 01:20:06,066
Praise the one who has changed me...
you have melted a stone.

668
01:20:07,512 --> 01:20:10,003
I've begun to feel scared of you.
- Scared of me?

669
01:20:10,581 --> 01:20:17,316
Now that I've turned human?
- As Dad says, a human being...

670
01:20:17,588 --> 01:20:19,852
is the most dangerous creature.
- What nonsense!

671
01:20:20,324 --> 01:20:23,316
You spent so many days with me...
weren't you scared?

672
01:20:23,828 --> 01:20:26,729
You weren't human then.
- Don't be under the wrong impression.

673
01:20:27,431 --> 01:20:31,868
Actually, I'm still not human.
- What are you then?

674
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:33,402
A lover!

675
01:20:53,457 --> 01:20:58,019
Mala! You're such a darling!
- Where did the two of you disappear?

676
01:20:58,396 --> 01:21:00,864
First tell me... was it
a baby boy or a baby girl?

677
01:21:02,199 --> 01:21:04,690
Tell me! Go on!

678
01:21:05,269 --> 01:21:07,203
It's a baby-boy.
- A baby boy?

679
01:21:07,471 --> 01:21:14,070
You must distribute sweets, Mala!
- What sweets? Whose baby?

680
01:21:16,213 --> 01:21:20,115
When she was at the hospital,
there was a woman about to deliver.

681
01:21:20,585 --> 01:21:23,816
Mala said she'd have a baby-girl
and I said it would be a male child.

682
01:21:24,188 --> 01:21:25,018
I've won!

683
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:29,085
And I think, I've won.

684
01:21:30,761 --> 01:21:33,321
Mala, you must distribute
double the amount of sweets.

685
01:21:33,698 --> 01:21:36,292
The two of us have
returned alive.

686
01:21:36,567 --> 01:21:41,527
Think about it. Had the storm
not abated, we'd have died!

687
01:21:48,813 --> 01:21:51,611
Brother! Are you actually laughing?

688
01:21:52,416 --> 01:21:58,480
Three things you need to live, Mala.
Laughter, happiness... and flowers!

689
01:21:59,323 --> 01:22:03,419
Don't go there again, brother.
Lest there's another storm.

690
01:22:03,894 --> 01:22:06,590
The biggest storm in my life,
I have already weathered.

691
01:22:07,398 --> 01:22:09,958
Who's scared of lesser storms?
- I am!

692
01:22:12,103 --> 01:22:13,934
The two of you are grown ups!
You ought to be ashamed!

693
01:22:14,171 --> 01:22:17,732
Have you thought of what
people will say about you?

694
01:22:18,576 --> 01:22:21,238
But it was a co-incidence, doctor...

695
01:22:21,746 --> 01:22:24,408
Doesn't make it a co-incidence
just because you claim it was one.

696
01:22:24,915 --> 01:22:29,545
I'm a gentleman. You ought
to trust me.

697
01:22:30,154 --> 01:22:32,088
That isn't something you can
make out from somebody's looks.

698
01:22:34,091 --> 01:22:37,549
Suppose I say, I'm in
love with your daughter?

699
01:22:37,928 --> 01:22:38,952
I'd shoot you!

700
01:22:41,298 --> 01:22:45,200
Suppose I say your daughter
is in love with me too?

701
01:22:45,803 --> 01:22:50,763
She's still a child. She doesn't
know what's good for her.

702
01:22:52,677 --> 01:22:56,579
Suppose I say that the two
of us... want to get married?

703
01:23:04,055 --> 01:23:06,649
I'll have to leave for Bombay then.
To talk it over with your mother.

704
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:12,121
Mother? That's not necessary.
I'm going to Bombay anyway.

705
01:23:12,496 --> 01:23:14,828
I'll talk it over with her and
send you a wire to come over.

706
01:23:23,841 --> 01:23:26,435
What are you feeling shy for?

707
01:23:27,144 --> 01:23:28,941
Telegram for you, sir.

708
01:23:38,923 --> 01:23:41,391
It's a telegram from mother.
- What does she say?

709
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:46,521
She asks us to return immediately.
- Then we must go.

710
01:23:46,997 --> 01:23:48,294
Have those tickets
booked for tomorrow.

711
01:24:00,578 --> 01:24:04,139
I'm not going away forever.
- I don't know why, I'm very scared.

712
01:24:06,584 --> 01:24:10,145
What does that laughter mean?
- It means you're in love.

713
01:24:11,088 --> 01:24:14,524
When you are in love with someone,
problems of the heart increase too.

714
01:24:15,226 --> 01:24:17,057
You won't understand how I feel.

715
01:24:17,762 --> 01:24:20,230
I've suddenly got all
the happiness in the world.

716
01:24:20,598 --> 01:24:23,066
I'm so scared...
I don't trust my luck.

717
01:24:23,968 --> 01:24:25,458
But I do trust my luck.

718
01:24:26,604 --> 01:24:29,198
No one can snatch these joys from me.
- Really?

719
01:24:29,573 --> 01:24:31,165
Yes.
- Swear it on me.

720
01:24:32,309 --> 01:24:33,571
On your head, I do.

721
01:24:34,145 --> 01:24:35,976
Let me see you smile now...
Go on.

722
01:24:36,881 --> 01:24:39,042
You're leaving tomorrow.
And you ask me to smile?

723
01:24:39,617 --> 01:24:43,280
Yes, Raj. Because today is the
biggest day of my life.

724
01:24:44,221 --> 01:24:45,483
I have you this day.

725
01:24:46,190 --> 01:24:49,182
On such a joyous day,
why must you shed tears?

726
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:53,790
Come, let's spend these few moments
before I leave, in peace and joy.

727
01:24:53,898 --> 01:24:54,592
Come.

728
01:25:37,641 --> 01:25:40,439
"All day I have spent
in your company"

729
01:25:40,811 --> 01:25:43,712
"Let me go home now, my love"

730
01:25:44,215 --> 01:25:47,343
"Good bye, my love..."

731
01:25:47,585 --> 01:25:53,683
"Good bye, darling..."

732
01:25:54,592 --> 01:25:57,186
"Good night, darling"

733
01:25:57,761 --> 01:26:00,457
"So easy it is to walk
out of a gathering..."

734
01:26:00,731 --> 01:26:03,723
"but how will you ever
leave my heart?"

735
01:26:04,001 --> 01:26:07,232
"Good bye, my darling..."

736
01:26:07,605 --> 01:26:16,741
"Good night, my love"

737
01:26:37,968 --> 01:26:50,836
"My love, ask me and
I could block your path"

738
01:26:51,448 --> 01:27:04,293
"The night of separation is here...
what am I to do? Tell me"

739
01:27:04,662 --> 01:27:07,460
"I'm going to remember
every word you said..."

740
01:27:07,831 --> 01:27:10,629
"And I will pine for you"

741
01:27:11,101 --> 01:27:16,869
"Good bye, my love..."

742
01:27:17,241 --> 01:27:23,874
"Good night, darling"

743
01:27:24,448 --> 01:27:27,246
"All day I have spent with you"

744
01:27:27,751 --> 01:27:30,549
"Let me go home now"

745
01:27:31,021 --> 01:27:36,789
"Good bye, my love..."

746
01:27:37,161 --> 01:27:43,657
"Good night, darling"

747
01:28:01,085 --> 01:28:04,418
"I'm the earth...
and you're the skies"

748
01:28:04,788 --> 01:28:07,484
"You have cast a shadow on me"

749
01:28:07,858 --> 01:28:10,759
"I'm the earth...
and you're the skies"

750
01:28:11,128 --> 01:28:14,063
"You have cast a shadow on me"

751
01:28:15,099 --> 01:28:27,409
"In my heart, you have come to be"

752
01:28:28,112 --> 01:28:31,013
"Let my eyes be"

753
01:28:31,382 --> 01:28:34,317
"Let them dream"

754
01:28:34,785 --> 01:28:40,746
"Good bye, my love..."

755
01:28:41,025 --> 01:28:47,328
"Good bye, darling"

756
01:28:48,032 --> 01:28:50,694
"Easy it is to walk out
of a gathering"

757
01:28:51,201 --> 01:28:54,102
"How will you ever leave my heart?"

758
01:28:54,471 --> 01:29:00,432
"Good bye, darling..."

759
01:29:00,811 --> 01:29:06,772
"Good night, my love"

760
01:29:28,072 --> 01:29:40,815
"If only this beautiful,
mischievous night were not"

761
01:29:41,718 --> 01:29:54,153
"It comes after day after day...
had it only not come today"

762
01:29:54,431 --> 01:29:57,127
"You wouldn't have
gone away from me..."

763
01:29:57,734 --> 01:30:00,635
"and life would be made"

764
01:30:01,004 --> 01:30:06,965
"Good bye, darling..."

765
01:30:07,244 --> 01:30:12,978
"Good night, my love"

766
01:30:14,017 --> 01:30:16,815
"All day, I have spent with you"

767
01:30:17,187 --> 01:30:19,985
"Let me go home now"

768
01:30:20,491 --> 01:30:26,020
"Good night, my love..."

769
01:30:26,597 --> 01:30:30,158
"Good bye, darling"

770
01:30:30,434 --> 01:30:32,994
"Good bye, darling"

771
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:46,013
"Good bye, darling"

772
01:30:50,370 --> 01:30:54,898
What will happen of my baby?
How will he manage?

773
01:30:55,175 --> 01:30:58,542
You are my daughter now, dear.

774
01:30:59,012 --> 01:31:01,139
Wherever I go, the baby
goes with me.

775
01:31:02,282 --> 01:31:04,978
When you come to Bombay,
do bring the baby along.

776
01:31:05,686 --> 01:31:09,884
That's my first duty. The other
duty is to unite this idiot...

777
01:31:10,157 --> 01:31:15,026
with his father!

778
01:31:30,711 --> 01:31:31,871
Aren't you ashamed?

779
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:35,948
In three months, you forget
the principles of your family?

780
01:31:37,951 --> 01:31:39,885
When did you arrive?
- Right now, mom.

781
01:31:40,787 --> 01:31:41,947
When had you promised to return?

782
01:31:44,191 --> 01:31:46,853
When had you promised to return?
- Yesterday...

783
01:31:47,127 --> 01:31:50,255
we're late by 24 hours.
- Forgive us.

784
01:31:51,732 --> 01:31:52,756
Go to your room.

785
01:31:57,971 --> 01:32:01,532
How could you forget that you've
got to leave for Ramgarh tomorrow?

786
01:32:02,776 --> 01:32:06,234
Look. The King was scared.
He has sent an urgent telegram.

787
01:32:06,613 --> 01:32:10,276
Mother...
- Your father had fixed the alliance.

788
01:32:10,751 --> 01:32:14,881
What if I don't like the girl?
- She's a princess, Shekhar.

789
01:32:15,889 --> 01:32:19,120
That's okay. But if she turns out
to be ill-mannered?

790
01:32:19,626 --> 01:32:20,786
She will still remain a princess.

791
01:32:21,695 --> 01:32:26,894
I can't understand how you
have forgotten your principles.

792
01:32:30,904 --> 01:32:33,805
You don't know mother.
Your son almost died!

793
01:32:34,274 --> 01:32:37,835
It's true. I was caught in a storm.
The worst storm I've seen in my life!

794
01:32:38,312 --> 01:32:43,079
I felt as if I'd never see
my mother ever again.

795
01:32:44,017 --> 01:32:46,815
I prayed every day and said...

796
01:32:47,087 --> 01:32:49,885
God, let me see
my mother once again.

797
01:32:50,891 --> 01:32:52,483
Didn't you feel anything, Mom?

798
01:32:53,427 --> 01:32:56,089
That I was caught in a storm...
and I was missing you?

799
01:32:57,030 --> 01:32:58,292
Only you, Mom...

800
01:32:58,999 --> 01:33:00,694
Only you.

801
01:33:02,069 --> 01:33:10,443
My son!
- I have you, Mom...

802
01:33:10,911 --> 01:33:12,173
and I have everything!

803
01:33:28,862 --> 01:33:30,454
Did you see your son's behavior?

804
01:33:30,831 --> 01:33:33,061
A few days he spends in Kashmir,
and he's a changed man!

805
01:33:33,467 --> 01:33:36,994
He laughs like any other man.
He sulks like small children.

806
01:33:37,504 --> 01:33:40,200
He hugged me tightly
when I was angry with him.

807
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:42,132
His behavior, I didn't...

808
01:33:45,579 --> 01:33:48,946
I have a complaint
against myself too.

809
01:33:50,417 --> 01:33:54,854
I don't know why,
but I liked what he did.

810
01:33:56,523 --> 01:33:59,754
The way he cried "Mother"
and hugged me...

811
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:02,057
I liked that so very much.

812
01:34:03,730 --> 01:34:05,220
But it won't happen again.

813
01:34:05,932 --> 01:34:08,526
For your principles and
my children's future...

814
01:34:09,002 --> 01:34:11,368
I will sacrifice my feelings.

815
01:34:12,406 --> 01:34:16,843
Jeevan, I can't bear this anymore.

816
01:34:17,411 --> 01:34:19,777
How long do you expect me to
stay away from my child?

817
01:34:20,814 --> 01:34:23,374
I'll have a word with Mom today.
I'll tell her that we...

818
01:34:23,650 --> 01:34:27,313
Don't do that. Don't you know
what a lady your mother is?

819
01:34:27,921 --> 01:34:31,584
We won't be able to live if
our child comes to any harm.

820
01:34:31,958 --> 01:34:35,086
How long then? No one would
remain silent in such a situation.

821
01:34:35,462 --> 01:34:39,592
But we must maintain our silence.
For the sake of our child.

822
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:43,728
Have patience, Mala. God willing,
everything will be all right.

823
01:35:11,531 --> 01:35:13,556
Stop it, guys...
the dictator is about to arrive.

824
01:35:15,135 --> 01:35:17,603
There aren't so many restrictions
during a curfew...

825
01:35:17,771 --> 01:35:19,671
as there are when this
beast arrives in the office.

826
01:35:28,482 --> 01:35:29,278
I'll take that in.

827
01:35:30,116 --> 01:35:30,946
Give me a salute!

828
01:35:32,085 --> 01:35:33,245
Go on.

829
01:35:48,101 --> 01:35:52,504
Ask them to stop laughing.
It's time for the boss to arrive.

830
01:35:52,906 --> 01:35:57,104
Laughing isn't a bad thing, sir.
Why don't you make the boss see reason?

831
01:35:57,811 --> 01:36:00,712
I could make him see reason,
if were human. That beast...

832
01:36:00,981 --> 01:36:04,542
Sir! You?

833
01:36:05,252 --> 01:36:07,948
You will no longer remain the
Manager of this company.

834
01:36:08,755 --> 01:36:12,657
Please don't do that, sir...
I've children to feed.

835
01:36:12,926 --> 01:36:16,157
I don't care! I have decided!
- But, sir...

836
01:36:16,730 --> 01:36:21,497
No buts! You are no
longer the manager...

837
01:36:22,202 --> 01:36:23,897
you are my uncle!

838
01:36:24,504 --> 01:36:27,302
Not sir... call me Shekhar.

839
01:36:28,542 --> 01:36:34,310
Yes. You've worked hard to make
this company a success, uncle.

840
01:36:34,581 --> 01:36:36,606
Shekhar!
- Yes, uncle...

841
01:36:37,183 --> 01:36:39,344
My word! That beast has
turned human!

842
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:41,182
Amazing!

843
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:49,826
Wow! What aroma!

844
01:36:50,430 --> 01:36:54,958
Sit down, uncle. Never insult food
by getting up while you're eating.

845
01:36:55,335 --> 01:36:59,237
That's tasty food, mister...
your wife cooked it?

846
01:36:59,839 --> 01:37:02,205
Oh yes. She has personally cooked it.

847
01:37:02,576 --> 01:37:07,775
Well, well! Your wife cooks for you,
and you ogle at 'em all!

848
01:37:10,016 --> 01:37:13,247
That looks nice...
home-made, I think.

849
01:37:15,055 --> 01:37:16,955
Oh yes! This surely is homemade!

850
01:37:17,757 --> 01:37:21,659
I liked him the way he was earlier.
He ate up half my food!

851
01:37:24,764 --> 01:37:28,860
You aren't eating alone today!
We're going to enjoy your food!

852
01:37:29,235 --> 01:37:30,202
C'mon...

853
01:37:52,692 --> 01:37:53,624
Why did you walk away?

854
01:37:56,529 --> 01:37:58,656
After all the hard work, if you still
can't manage two square meals...

855
01:37:59,032 --> 01:38:01,057
it's I who should be ashamed,
not you.

856
01:38:01,768 --> 01:38:04,430
Those tears, I must shed.
Not you.

857
01:38:05,472 --> 01:38:10,239
No, boss. You pay me enough.
It's just my bad luck.

858
01:38:10,510 --> 01:38:13,536
Nonsense! I pay you nothing!
That's why you starve.

859
01:38:14,347 --> 01:38:17,145
From this month... you get
a raise of 200 rupees.

860
01:38:18,818 --> 01:38:23,482
You even thank me with
tears in your eyes?

861
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:40,870
Who's that?

862
01:38:41,141 --> 01:38:43,701
Manager? Why hasn't Shekhar
come home for lunch?

863
01:38:44,744 --> 01:38:46,871
He ate here today.

864
01:38:47,714 --> 01:38:49,739
Where is "here"?

865
01:38:50,450 --> 01:38:52,475
With all of us.

866
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:55,410
Looks like he has gone mad!

867
01:38:56,556 --> 01:39:00,458
I'll call the doctor immediately.
Bring Shekhar home at 5 p.m.

868
01:39:03,029 --> 01:39:07,466
And book a ticket for Shekhar by
tomorrow morning's train to Ramgarh.

869
01:39:08,268 --> 01:39:09,963
Very well, madam.

870
01:39:17,010 --> 01:39:19,911
The lady called to say that
Shekhar has gone mad.

871
01:39:20,313 --> 01:39:22,975
What has he been doing?
- Nothing much.

872
01:39:24,017 --> 01:39:25,382
It's just that he bites.

873
01:39:26,319 --> 01:39:29,117
What?! He bites?
- Yes.

874
01:39:29,689 --> 01:39:31,520
He bit a servant on the cheek
this morning.

875
01:39:31,991 --> 01:39:34,118
The poor guy went with
his left cheek missing.

876
01:39:47,540 --> 01:39:48,564
Shekhar...

877
01:39:50,276 --> 01:39:54,713
I'm meeting you after ages!
I'm not letting you go today!

878
01:39:55,181 --> 01:39:57,445
Now look, son. It's bad to bite.
And you know...

879
01:39:57,817 --> 01:40:00,809
man goes mad after a dog-bite!
- What you don't know...

880
01:40:01,221 --> 01:40:04,213
is that you die when you're
bitten by a madman!

881
01:40:04,491 --> 01:40:05,515
Oh no!
- Oh yes!

882
01:40:06,126 --> 01:40:08,924
I'm trapped then!
- Has a madman bitten you already?

883
01:40:09,295 --> 01:40:12,423
Not yet... But I'm afraid...
- He might bite?

884
01:40:12,699 --> 01:40:14,394
Yes!
- Strange man you are, uncle!

885
01:40:14,667 --> 01:40:17,033
You go to places where...
- I'll never come here again!

886
01:40:17,604 --> 01:40:20,072
Here?
- I mean, I'll never go there again!

887
01:40:21,674 --> 01:40:23,232
What's this, uncle?
- Nothing!

888
01:40:23,743 --> 01:40:25,768
It was lying on the table.
I happened to pick it up.

889
01:40:26,579 --> 01:40:33,644
Remember how much I loved you
when you were a kid, Shekhar?

890
01:40:34,220 --> 01:40:36,916
I used to give you lollipops
without your mother getting to know!

891
01:40:37,190 --> 01:40:41,627
Oh yes. And I used my little teeth
to fondly bite your fleshy cheeks!

892
01:40:42,128 --> 01:40:45,461
So what if I've grown up? I still
feel like biting you!

893
01:40:45,732 --> 01:40:48,098
No! Don't! I suffer from a disease.
A terrible disease!

894
01:40:48,468 --> 01:40:52,905
I have a rash... even on my cheeks!
- No point in screaming, uncle.

895
01:40:53,273 --> 01:40:56,071
You've contacted the disease
from a madman.

896
01:40:56,543 --> 01:40:59,671
Relax for a while. You'll be all right.
- No. I want to go home!

897
01:40:59,946 --> 01:41:01,311
Come on... move!

898
01:41:02,882 --> 01:41:03,610
Sit down.

899
01:41:04,517 --> 01:41:05,484
Lie down... go on!

900
01:41:07,053 --> 01:41:08,077
Now shut your eyes.

901
01:41:15,795 --> 01:41:20,459
What're you scared of?
No madman can come here.

902
01:41:20,834 --> 01:41:23,826
Because I'm the maddest of them all.
My bite could even kill a madman!

903
01:41:24,103 --> 01:41:24,933
Good God!

904
01:41:25,205 --> 01:41:32,168
Look, uncle... I have yet to complete.

905
01:41:32,412 --> 01:41:35,870
Lie down for a while.
You will be all right.

906
01:41:36,583 --> 01:41:37,641
Lie down properly.

907
01:41:40,086 --> 01:41:40,916
I'll be back in a moment.

908
01:41:51,464 --> 01:41:54,262
Strange man! The doctor's in a
bad way, and you're laughing?

909
01:41:56,169 --> 01:42:00,606
I played a joke on him.
I told him that you've gone mad...

910
01:42:00,974 --> 01:42:03,534
and that you're biting everyone.
- What?

911
01:42:48,655 --> 01:42:50,054
Who has been laughing?

912
01:42:50,757 --> 01:42:52,315
Who dared to break the rules
of this household?

913
01:42:56,095 --> 01:42:58,689
It was the doctor who laughed, Mom.
- The doctor?

914
01:42:59,065 --> 01:43:04,025
Oh yes. I even asked him not to.
- Strange man.

915
01:43:04,537 --> 01:43:07,199
He laughed for a while.
And then he started crying.

916
01:43:07,707 --> 01:43:11,040
He started laughing again, said
I'm all right, and just ran away.

917
01:43:11,311 --> 01:43:14,212
The madman! The lunatic!

918
01:43:15,281 --> 01:43:17,772
Have the tickets
for Ramgarh arrived?

919
01:43:18,251 --> 01:43:19,946
Oh yes, I brought the
tickets this morning.

920
01:43:20,553 --> 01:43:23,021
I've just arrived from Kashmir, Mom.
How can I go to Ramgarh?

921
01:43:23,389 --> 01:43:26,290
By train.
- I've arrived only today, Mom.

922
01:43:26,559 --> 01:43:27,958
After a few days maybe. Okay?

923
01:43:28,194 --> 01:43:30,128
The princess can't wait
for you all her life.

924
01:43:31,264 --> 01:43:32,629
For how long do you
want to avoid marriage?

925
01:43:33,032 --> 01:43:35,057
How old am I anyway?
- You're 25.

926
01:43:37,270 --> 01:43:40,296
At what time does the train leave?
- At 8:00 a.m.

927
01:43:42,208 --> 01:43:44,904
I'm not going, Mom... Please agree!
- No!

928
01:43:45,378 --> 01:43:49,815
What do you think?
Am I dead already?

929
01:43:50,516 --> 01:43:54,953
Mom! Don't ever say that again.
May you live forever.

930
01:43:55,989 --> 01:43:59,755
I'll go, Mom. I certainly will.
Now give me a smile... Go on.

931
01:44:17,677 --> 01:44:21,044
What? Gulmohar?
- Yes. We owe Sajju 50,000 rupees.

932
01:44:21,414 --> 01:44:24,406
I asked him to forget the money
if he didn't arrange for the stay.

933
01:44:24,784 --> 01:44:26,718
Did he agree then?
- Like hell he did!

934
01:44:28,621 --> 01:44:30,020
But how do we manage the car?

935
01:44:30,823 --> 01:44:33,383
I've taken up a job
as a chauffeur yesterday.

936
01:44:33,993 --> 01:44:37,224
Well done! You are truly my son!

937
01:44:37,697 --> 01:44:43,226
You'll pleased to know that I've
invited all our creditors to the party.

938
01:44:43,836 --> 01:44:47,169
They'll attend our party
in their best clothes.

939
01:44:47,774 --> 01:44:51,335
Just wait and see what a
grand celebration we have!

940
01:44:52,245 --> 01:44:54,076
That's just what
I expected from you.

941
01:45:00,887 --> 01:45:06,951
"I attend a celebration at hers,
and what do I see?"

942
01:45:07,894 --> 01:45:09,384
"I attend a celebration at hers,
and what do I see?"

943
01:45:09,629 --> 01:45:11,893
"The stars are all in the sky..."

944
01:45:12,265 --> 01:45:14,529
"but she's the dazzling Moon
here on earth"

945
01:45:15,668 --> 01:45:20,196
In honor of the Moon here...
Ms Suku will present a song.

946
01:48:01,801 --> 01:48:04,599
"What am I to do?"

947
01:48:05,304 --> 01:48:08,637
"What am I to do?"

948
01:48:09,675 --> 01:48:13,338
"I've lost my heart"

949
01:48:14,180 --> 01:48:17,411
"What am I to do?"

950
01:48:36,369 --> 01:48:40,271
"Some call me carefree;
Others call me crazy..."

951
01:48:40,740 --> 01:48:44,301
"and yet others call me a firefly"

952
01:48:45,211 --> 01:48:48,977
"I have a desire;
Oblivious of the world..."

953
01:48:49,382 --> 01:48:52,943
"I march ahead...
my destination is my beloved"

954
01:48:55,655 --> 01:48:59,216
"What am I to do?"

955
01:48:59,925 --> 01:49:03,383
"I've lost my heart"

956
01:49:04,397 --> 01:49:07,662
"What am I to do?"

957
01:49:30,756 --> 01:49:32,587
"Do not be shocked, my friends"

958
01:49:32,958 --> 01:49:34,755
"Do not be afraid of me"

959
01:49:35,161 --> 01:49:39,029
"Do not take my love
for a fancy"

960
01:49:39,965 --> 01:49:43,298
"I have taken her hand...
for a lifetime"

961
01:49:43,769 --> 01:49:47,136
"It's true... not a story"

962
01:49:49,909 --> 01:49:53,709
"What am I to do?"

963
01:49:54,380 --> 01:49:57,975
"I've lost my heart"

964
01:49:58,951 --> 01:50:02,409
"What am I to do?"

965
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:27,210
"In the way I look, in the way
I talk, I appear to be drunk"

966
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:29,710
"I've gone awry without
even drinking"

967
01:50:29,982 --> 01:50:33,645
"My desires make me helpless"

968
01:50:33,953 --> 01:50:35,750
"I'm anxious every moment"

969
01:50:36,021 --> 01:50:38,046
"But why would I lead a life,
bereft of any love?"

970
01:50:40,593 --> 01:50:44,051
"What am I to do?"

971
01:50:44,964 --> 01:50:48,422
"I've lost my heart"

972
01:50:49,535 --> 01:51:06,977
"What am I to do?"

973
01:51:44,769 --> 01:51:46,464
He seems to be mad, father.

974
01:51:54,946 --> 01:51:56,880
Looks like a family of madmen.

975
01:52:04,022 --> 01:52:08,686
I don't want to marry a madman.
- And I always pray, my dear...

976
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:12,154
that God gives every girl
a rich madman for a husband.

977
01:52:26,077 --> 01:52:29,774
Manager, you may leave now.
- Very well.

978
01:52:32,984 --> 01:52:33,575
Sit down.

979
01:52:36,921 --> 01:52:40,482
Did you like the Rajkumari (Princess)?
- But of course, Mom!

980
01:52:40,859 --> 01:52:42,656
She dazzles in the night...
and soothes by day.

981
01:52:43,928 --> 01:52:47,591
What kind of eyes does she have?
- Eyes? By God!

982
01:52:48,199 --> 01:52:52,295
A blind man could see again,
if she ever cast a look at him.

983
01:52:52,904 --> 01:52:54,462
A Princess, after all.
- Certainly.

984
01:52:55,073 --> 01:52:59,737
How are her folks?
- Folks? No. They're angels!

985
01:53:01,079 --> 01:53:03,240
That's exactly how the
blue-blooded Rajahs' are.

986
01:53:04,716 --> 01:53:09,244
What did they think of you?
- They liked my looks...

987
01:53:09,521 --> 01:53:14,288
they found my height and features
appealing, but by behavior...

988
01:53:14,559 --> 01:53:18,427
they said I was somewhat...
- Somewhat?

989
01:53:18,696 --> 01:53:19,958
Somewhat mad.

990
01:53:20,999 --> 01:53:22,057
Mad?

991
01:53:23,401 --> 01:53:25,869
In 25 years, I could
never understand you.

992
01:53:26,471 --> 01:53:28,598
And they see through you
in a few hours?

993
01:53:29,207 --> 01:53:33,200
What do you mean? I'm mad?
- They must've said it fondly.

994
01:53:34,012 --> 01:53:38,005
Can't you see that?
- Nobody calls me mad all the time.

995
01:53:38,516 --> 01:53:41,280
They called me mad when I ate.
And called me mad when I walked.

996
01:53:41,553 --> 01:53:43,487
In fact, do you know what they said
when I was about to leave?

997
01:53:44,522 --> 01:53:46,319
What?
- They said...

998
01:53:46,591 --> 01:53:49,059
"Yours is a family of nuts"
- Why didn't you shoot them?

999
01:53:49,761 --> 01:53:53,561
Shoot them? If I could help it,
I'd have given them a medal.

1000
01:53:54,365 --> 01:53:57,061
Bright guys. They got to
know me in just a few hours.

1001
01:53:57,302 --> 01:53:59,998
Shut up!
- Don't be angry, Mom!

1002
01:54:00,271 --> 01:54:02,831
They must've said it in fun...
can't you see?

1003
01:54:03,541 --> 01:54:06,009
People who say such things in fun
ought to have their necks twisted!

1004
01:54:06,177 --> 01:54:07,872
I thought as much.
And I was about to do it.

1005
01:54:08,346 --> 01:54:12,578
But the Princess's neck, Mom...
it's lovely.

1006
01:54:13,618 --> 01:54:16,280
She's one of the most beautiful...

1007
01:54:50,388 --> 01:54:54,381
My love is for real!
My love has won!

1008
01:55:32,263 --> 01:55:33,753
What about the consignment, boss?
- Send it!

1009
01:55:33,998 --> 01:55:36,489
That draft of 500,000
has arrived from Madras.

1010
01:55:36,734 --> 01:55:38,565
But there has been no
other remittance.

1011
01:55:39,037 --> 01:55:40,527
Let those coming in, come...
and let those leaving, go away!

1012
01:55:40,805 --> 01:55:42,602
How about that check for Simla?
- Love in Simla...

1013
01:55:42,974 --> 01:55:45,670
But "Love in Kashmir" is the best!

1014
01:55:51,282 --> 01:55:54,308
I thought you're sensible.
But you've turned out to be an ass.

1015
01:55:56,321 --> 01:55:58,687
The Raja has liked you very much.

1016
01:55:59,290 --> 01:56:00,314
They're want to come over.

1017
01:56:02,126 --> 01:56:05,584
Make a trunk call to them and ask
them to come here immediately...

1018
01:56:05,830 --> 01:56:06,888
and finalize the wedding.

1019
01:56:16,240 --> 01:56:17,832
Boss!
- Shekhar!

1020
01:56:32,690 --> 01:56:36,251
Doctor! Shekhar has fainted!

1021
01:56:37,061 --> 01:56:39,120
He has gone mad!

1022
01:56:40,231 --> 01:56:42,597
He has gone mad.
- He bites!

1023
01:56:45,069 --> 01:56:47,094
He even bites.

1024
01:56:48,239 --> 01:56:50,799
Bites, eh? I'm sorry,
I can't come.

1025
01:56:51,175 --> 01:56:52,335
I don't treat madmen.

1026
01:56:57,749 --> 01:56:59,580
You've got to play a doctor.
- Yes.

1027
01:57:00,385 --> 01:57:03,616
And no ordinary doctor. You've got
to be a very competent doctor.

1028
01:57:04,088 --> 01:57:07,319
Every word of yours, every mannerism,
must make a mark on her.

1029
01:57:07,925 --> 01:57:09,950
Oh sure! Just don't worry.

1030
01:57:10,328 --> 01:57:12,455
The entire family will
have had enough of me!

1031
01:57:12,730 --> 01:57:15,198
Don't talk nonsense. You don't
know the old lady's temper.

1032
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:19,361
If she gets to know you're a fake
doctor, she's going to shoot you.

1033
01:57:19,837 --> 01:57:22,431
God Almighty! I don't want
to play the doctor!

1034
01:57:22,907 --> 01:57:24,704
Do you want to continue with your job?
- Yes.

1035
01:57:25,209 --> 01:57:26,233
So get on with it!

1036
01:58:03,848 --> 01:58:07,545
A very high fever.
- Fever?

1037
01:58:09,454 --> 01:58:12,252
His body's cold.
- Cold?

1038
01:58:12,824 --> 01:58:15,292
You're right.
Foreign fever, you see.

1039
01:58:15,560 --> 01:58:17,255
Cold to touch.
But hot within!

1040
01:58:17,628 --> 01:58:19,027
Just like you.

1041
01:58:20,698 --> 01:58:23,166
Would a thermometer reveal it?
- Oh yes, yes!

1042
01:58:26,604 --> 01:58:29,402
We use our own thermometer.

1043
01:58:30,341 --> 01:58:31,808
Bhola, get the thermometer.

1044
01:58:33,945 --> 01:58:35,435
Idiot!
- What could I have done?

1045
01:58:45,656 --> 01:58:47,681
Some water, please... water.

1046
01:59:14,485 --> 01:59:18,819
104 degrees!
- What disease is this, doctor?

1047
01:59:20,057 --> 01:59:22,321
This is the first time I've seen
such a disease in India.

1048
01:59:22,894 --> 01:59:30,198
It's called Love Fever.
- Love Fever?

1049
01:59:32,203 --> 01:59:38,836
How about a cure?
- Tangled cures for tangled diseases.

1050
01:59:39,410 --> 01:59:43,073
No one must give the patient any love.
Go nowhere close to him.

1051
01:59:43,581 --> 01:59:44,843
That includes you too.

1052
01:59:46,217 --> 01:59:47,775
You ought to be very strict
with the patient.

1053
01:59:48,386 --> 01:59:52,186
What happened, doctor?
- Maybe I haven't examined something.

1054
02:00:00,865 --> 02:00:02,992
The fever seems to be coming
from the knee-joint.

1055
02:00:04,902 --> 02:00:07,029
How about hitting me some more?

1056
02:00:07,538 --> 02:00:09,130
Lie down, son... relax.

1057
02:00:13,778 --> 02:00:18,647
Who asked you to bring all that food?
- You did, doctor.

1058
02:00:19,217 --> 02:00:21,048
Did I? Oh yes.

1059
02:00:22,253 --> 02:00:23,311
Pancakes?

1060
02:00:23,588 --> 02:00:24,520
I'm fond of it... it's great.

1061
02:00:24,789 --> 02:00:25,278
Rossogollas?

1062
02:00:25,556 --> 02:00:34,362
Is all that food, for him?
- No. I'm going to eat it.

1063
02:00:35,066 --> 02:00:36,431
So he can watch me eat!

1064
02:00:36,834 --> 02:00:39,064
That's how his disease is.
And this is the cure!

1065
02:00:44,041 --> 02:00:47,272
Some vegetable, eh?
All right.

1066
02:00:47,645 --> 02:00:55,347
What else?
- Some halwa, please.

1067
02:00:56,187 --> 02:00:59,953
Not some, I'll eat it all!
- Mom! I'll have some too!

1068
02:01:00,558 --> 02:01:02,355
No!
- Who the hell are you to stop me?

1069
02:01:02,860 --> 02:01:04,122
The doctor...
- Doctor, my foot!

1070
02:01:04,695 --> 02:01:09,792
D'you think I'll go away
if you insult me?

1071
02:01:14,238 --> 02:01:19,767
Mom, pay the doctor his fees.
- No, madam. The money isn't...

1072
02:01:24,081 --> 02:01:24,775
Halwa, eh?

1073
02:01:30,321 --> 02:01:37,250
I ordered all the goodies for myself.
No cure for you, if you eat that.

1074
02:01:37,528 --> 02:01:38,552
To hell with the cure!

1075
02:01:39,597 --> 02:01:41,189
Gulab jamun!
- I'll have some...

1076
02:01:41,565 --> 02:01:43,055
No, you won't!

1077
02:01:45,836 --> 02:01:49,067
Such humiliation! Such injustice!
I'm not going to play doctor!

1078
02:01:49,674 --> 02:01:52,666
What are you talking about?
Lt'll ruin everything!

1079
02:01:55,680 --> 02:01:57,511
Agree with him, son.

1080
02:01:58,282 --> 02:02:01,115
Let's compromise.
- What compromise?

1081
02:02:01,352 --> 02:02:05,049
You eat one half. And let him
have the other half.

1082
02:02:06,057 --> 02:02:07,456
Never!
- I'm leaving!

1083
02:02:08,025 --> 02:02:09,083
Please...

1084
02:02:11,329 --> 02:02:17,165
I'm willing to settle for
two pancakes and a gulab jamun.

1085
02:02:17,668 --> 02:02:21,001
I won't give you a single piece!
- Really? Here I go then...

1086
02:02:21,706 --> 02:02:22,536
Where will you?

1087
02:02:39,323 --> 02:02:41,587
Madam, I want to have
a word with you.

1088
02:02:42,927 --> 02:02:45,953
What kind of a nurse are you?
- The kind of doctor you are.

1089
02:02:46,330 --> 02:02:49,993
I'll starve the patient
and eat in his presence!

1090
02:03:02,847 --> 02:03:03,779
Please sit down.

1091
02:03:05,349 --> 02:03:08,375
The patient is in a very
serious condition, madam.

1092
02:03:09,186 --> 02:03:11,984
No wedding for him.
For another 5 years.

1093
02:03:12,590 --> 02:03:14,717
But he's about to
get married, doctor.

1094
02:03:15,092 --> 02:03:21,053
What do you value more?
His life? Or his wedding?

1095
02:03:21,532 --> 02:03:23,363
But, doctor...
- No way!

1096
02:03:24,168 --> 02:03:26,295
Saving him after the wedding
will be very difficult.

1097
02:03:26,904 --> 02:03:28,166
What?
- Oh yes.

1098
02:03:32,376 --> 02:03:34,936
There's a telegram
from Shekhar's mother.

1099
02:03:35,446 --> 02:03:37,243
Shekhar is ill. The wedding can't
take place for another 5 years.

1100
02:03:37,615 --> 02:03:38,673
5 years?
- Yes.

1101
02:03:39,717 --> 02:03:43,153
He first pretended to be mad.
- And he's now feigning illness.

1102
02:03:43,754 --> 02:03:45,119
There is something fishy.

1103
02:03:45,723 --> 02:03:48,624
They haven't discovered our
real position, have they?

1104
02:03:48,993 --> 02:03:51,689
Oh no. In that case, they would
have turned down the proposal.

1105
02:03:52,163 --> 02:03:53,425
So we must leave for
Bombay immediately.

1106
02:03:53,931 --> 02:03:57,162
The wedding will take place.
Without any delay.

1107
02:03:57,435 --> 02:03:58,993
They don't know what I'm capable of.

1108
02:03:59,403 --> 02:04:01,963
To revive my state,
I'd even stake my life.

1109
02:04:07,878 --> 02:04:09,709
She sends a wire that
they're arriving.

1110
02:04:09,947 --> 02:04:13,747
But when, how and what for?
She makes no mention.

1111
02:04:14,318 --> 02:04:17,776
Wow! This is good news, brother!
Sweeten your tongue!

1112
02:04:18,389 --> 02:04:21,825
Whenever they arrive, she'll
surely come to meet us.

1113
02:04:22,226 --> 02:04:26,424
Oh sure. And if they meet Mom first
and say discuss silly...

1114
02:04:26,797 --> 02:04:30,028
the cookie crumbles!
- Here you are, Shekhar.

1115
02:04:30,835 --> 02:04:35,636
And I took the doctor to your room.
- I'm absolutely fine, Mom.

1116
02:04:36,207 --> 02:04:38,334
I'm even going to the office.
Doctor, you may go.

1117
02:04:38,742 --> 02:04:41,540
You need to rest.

1118
02:04:48,986 --> 02:04:51,147
You lose a month's salary, okay?

1119
02:04:59,630 --> 02:05:04,158
Really? So I'll invite them over
and fix the date of the wedding.

1120
02:05:04,869 --> 02:05:07,895
I think you should follow
the doctor's suggestion, Mom.

1121
02:05:09,140 --> 02:05:12,268
I'm leaving.
- What do you suggest, doctor?

1122
02:05:12,643 --> 02:05:17,080
Very good news! Marriage is the
best cure for every disease!

1123
02:05:17,781 --> 02:05:21,012
Madam, I wanted your advice too.

1124
02:05:27,391 --> 02:05:30,087
Doctor! You may go!

1125
02:05:36,133 --> 02:05:39,694
They are here. And I'm going
to finalize your alliance.

1126
02:05:47,211 --> 02:05:50,874
Forgive me, Raja Saheb. I was
talking to Shekhar on the telephone.

1127
02:05:51,115 --> 02:05:52,082
That's okay.

1128
02:05:53,417 --> 02:05:56,545
Mala, take the Rajkumari (princess)
Around the mansion.

1129
02:05:57,688 --> 02:05:59,622
I have something important to
discuss with Raja Saheb (King).

1130
02:06:00,224 --> 02:06:02,124
Very well, Mom.
This way, Rajkumari.

1131
02:06:08,532 --> 02:06:13,162
I'm a bit apprehensive.
What did Shekhar do...

1132
02:06:13,571 --> 02:06:16,665
that you said he came from
a family of madmen?

1133
02:06:17,174 --> 02:06:19,301
Pardon me?
Oh, not at all.

1134
02:06:19,910 --> 02:06:23,471
He must've been joking.
Nothing of the sort ever happened.

1135
02:06:24,815 --> 02:06:29,047
He was all praise for Rajkumari.
- She's like your own daughter.

1136
02:06:30,187 --> 02:06:33,850
May I take the alliance for real then?
- Certainly.

1137
02:06:36,293 --> 02:06:38,557
But why are you
calling me Raja Saheb?

1138
02:06:39,163 --> 02:06:41,723
Because you are Rajkumari's
(the Princess)'s father.

1139
02:06:42,967 --> 02:06:45,128
I see... thank you.

1140
02:06:45,703 --> 02:06:50,367
Would you mind leaving Rajkumari
here with me?

1141
02:06:51,175 --> 02:06:55,077
Not at all. You may keep here
by all means.

1142
02:07:11,729 --> 02:07:12,787
You are beautiful.

1143
02:07:14,598 --> 02:07:15,724
Very beautiful.

1144
02:07:19,970 --> 02:07:22,962
Why did you hang your head?
Do you think I'm lying?

1145
02:07:24,108 --> 02:07:26,804
You are really beautiful.
Very, very beautiful.

1146
02:07:27,378 --> 02:07:29,642
Well...
- What does that mean?

1147
02:07:30,114 --> 02:07:32,480
Do you agree, or do you disagree?
- I agree.

1148
02:07:32,850 --> 02:07:34,442
Agree to what?
- I'm beautiful...

1149
02:07:34,818 --> 02:07:36,410
very, very beautiful.

1150
02:07:37,888 --> 02:07:38,616
Follow me.

1151
02:08:07,184 --> 02:08:09,015
You have given her your blessings?

1152
02:08:10,254 --> 02:08:12,085
I'm satisfied.

1153
02:08:14,625 --> 02:08:19,961
Take a look... doesn't our
daughter-in-law have beautiful eyes?

1154
02:08:22,299 --> 02:08:27,168
Apart from good looks, she shows
the grooming of a great family.

1155
02:08:29,306 --> 02:08:31,672
She's as illuminating
as the Sunrise.

1156
02:08:32,910 --> 02:08:37,006
Whichever household she marries in...
she'll bring glory to it.

1157
02:08:38,582 --> 02:08:42,279
Shekhar has recovered
as soon as she arrived.

1158
02:08:44,054 --> 02:08:47,717
Such a blessed arrival.
- Very much so!

1159
02:08:49,760 --> 02:08:51,887
Did you hear something, dear?
- Yes, I did.

1160
02:08:56,100 --> 02:09:00,969
I know, my Lord... we'll always
remain together in soul.

1161
02:09:02,206 --> 02:09:04,572
Because, a soul never dies.

1162
02:09:05,376 --> 02:09:10,279
To keep your souls alive...
laughter is very necessary in life.

1163
02:09:10,848 --> 02:09:14,215
I realized that after I died.
- Was it your voice?

1164
02:09:15,686 --> 02:09:18,678
It was Dad's soul,
speaking through me.

1165
02:09:18,956 --> 02:09:21,220
Shekhar! Naughty boy!
Go away!

1166
02:09:26,830 --> 02:09:30,823
You aren't just going
to be his wife.

1167
02:09:31,435 --> 02:09:33,562
You are also going to be the
daughter-in-law of this family.

1168
02:09:34,371 --> 02:09:38,273
You must consider it your good
fortune that you're the chosen one.

1169
02:09:38,976 --> 02:09:43,310
Not true, Mom. What makes me happiest
is that I have found a mother.

1170
02:09:44,982 --> 02:09:45,676
Bless you.

1171
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:54,757
Yes?
- I've come at Mr. Shekhar's bidding.

1172
02:09:55,359 --> 02:09:57,953
But Mr. Shekhar isn't at home.
- No?

1173
02:09:58,662 --> 02:10:01,130
I was told that he
is not keeping well.

1174
02:10:01,799 --> 02:10:04,927
Any idea where I can find?

1175
02:10:05,436 --> 02:10:09,429
I have a feeling he has gone to the
bungalow at Juhu to meet Rajkumari.

1176
02:10:09,807 --> 02:10:14,244
Well, well! Who is Rajkumari?
- Don't you know?

1177
02:10:14,845 --> 02:10:17,837
She's the one he's going to marry.

1178
02:10:19,850 --> 02:10:21,010
Thank you very much.

1179
02:10:32,996 --> 02:10:35,226
You ought to understand.
You're a doctor!

1180
02:10:35,499 --> 02:10:40,266
I can't go to sleep,
thinking of the child.

1181
02:10:40,437 --> 02:10:43,873
Give him a sleeping pill, dad.
- Why don't you understand?

1182
02:10:44,274 --> 02:10:47,937
I'm here to take the baby home.
I'm his father! He's my son!

1183
02:10:50,180 --> 02:10:51,306
I will naturally crave for him.

1184
02:10:51,582 --> 02:10:56,781
What you must do, young man,
is to go and talk to the lady.

1185
02:10:57,287 --> 02:11:00,620
You don't know her, doctor.
If she gets to know...

1186
02:11:00,791 --> 02:11:03,783
my child won't be spared.
- And you don't know me either.

1187
02:11:04,261 --> 02:11:05,990
This isn't just a
question of Mala's honor...

1188
02:11:06,230 --> 02:11:08,494
it's a question of my life
and my promise too.

1189
02:11:09,099 --> 02:11:11,567
No harm will come to the child...
even if I died.

1190
02:11:14,238 --> 02:11:17,674
Just what we feared. Shekhar's using
deceit to get married.

1191
02:11:18,275 --> 02:11:20,539
Her mother will think that
the bride is a Rajkumari.

1192
02:11:21,111 --> 02:11:22,806
Whereas, she's a mere
physician's daughter.

1193
02:11:23,413 --> 02:11:25,347
The two of them are
conning the old lady.

1194
02:11:26,149 --> 02:11:30,677
We must delay this no further.
- We belong to a royal family, father.

1195
02:11:31,388 --> 02:11:34,949
What we don't get easily,
we have learnt to snatch.

1196
02:11:35,559 --> 02:11:39,552
You're right, my dear. We must
meet Shekhar's mother immediately.

1197
02:11:40,364 --> 02:11:43,925
She should know who's fake
and who's the real Rajkumari.

1198
02:11:47,471 --> 02:11:49,939
Hello!
- Hello!

1199
02:11:51,074 --> 02:11:55,204
This way, please...
I'll show you to the drawing room.

1200
02:12:00,617 --> 02:12:02,414
When did you arrive?

1201
02:12:02,886 --> 02:12:06,879
I'll tell Mother...
- Who are they?

1202
02:12:08,058 --> 02:12:11,050
This...
this is my mother!

1203
02:12:11,695 --> 02:12:12,855
How are you?

1204
02:12:15,299 --> 02:12:18,427
Haven't you recognized me?
I'm the Raja of Ramgarh.

1205
02:12:19,002 --> 02:12:21,266
This is my daughter.

1206
02:12:23,073 --> 02:12:26,509
Shekhar visited our place.
They liked each other very much.

1207
02:12:28,312 --> 02:12:31,338
Is this the Rajkumari?

1208
02:12:34,117 --> 02:12:36,347
So who's that girl?
- Pardon me?

1209
02:12:37,821 --> 02:12:39,755
Please be seated.
I'll be back in a moment.

1210
02:12:43,760 --> 02:12:45,057
Hurry up...

1211
02:12:47,598 --> 02:12:52,467
Who is this girl?
- Rajkumari.

1212
02:12:53,937 --> 02:12:58,271
Rajkumari of which place?
Which place, I say!

1213
02:12:58,742 --> 02:13:02,769
I'll explain, mother. Please...
- Mother...

1214
02:13:03,914 --> 02:13:05,814
I think you have
misunderstood something.

1215
02:13:06,083 --> 02:13:08,551
I'm no princess.
My name itself is Rajkumari.

1216
02:13:09,686 --> 02:13:11,517
How about your father?
- He's a doctor.

1217
02:13:13,423 --> 02:13:16,119
Where did you first meet Shekhar?
- In Kashmir.

1218
02:13:16,793 --> 02:13:19,921
When Mala took ill.
- I see.

1219
02:13:20,430 --> 02:13:22,330
Using Mala for a bait...

1220
02:13:22,833 --> 02:13:25,393
you started dreaming of spending
your lives in high palaces!

1221
02:13:26,003 --> 02:13:27,027
What dreams?

1222
02:13:28,171 --> 02:13:30,435
That which the poor dream
of becoming rich.

1223
02:13:31,041 --> 02:13:34,704
Hear me out, Mom. I'm the one
to blame, Mom. Not this poor girl.

1224
02:13:35,612 --> 02:13:38,308
How many rich households have
been ruined by such poor people!

1225
02:13:38,682 --> 02:13:42,482
Forgive me. I maybe poor.
But I have a decent upbringing.

1226
02:13:43,720 --> 02:13:45,950
Is that why your father
gave you the name Rajkumari?

1227
02:13:46,657 --> 02:13:48,818
So that you could deceive
everyone in the world?

1228
02:13:49,393 --> 02:13:53,090
My father is a doctor.
He saves lives. He deceives no one.

1229
02:13:53,897 --> 02:13:55,694
Neither does he invite people home
and humiliate them.

1230
02:14:08,011 --> 02:14:12,539
You gave her your blessings...
and I was satisfied.

1231
02:14:14,217 --> 02:14:16,913
"How beautiful are
my daughter-in-law's eyes"

1232
02:14:17,287 --> 02:14:21,155
"Apart from looks, she shows signs
of grooming in an elevated family"

1233
02:14:22,959 --> 02:14:29,262
"You aren't just going to be his wife,
but the daughter-in-law of this family"

1234
02:14:29,733 --> 02:14:34,067
"Any family she marries into...
she'll bring glory to it"

1235
02:14:34,438 --> 02:14:36,269
Chandrashekhar!
- Chandrashekhar is dead!

1236
02:14:37,107 --> 02:14:41,441
In his place is a man...
not a stone!

1237
02:14:42,045 --> 02:14:47,915
Human beings have principles.
They do not stoop!

1238
02:14:48,085 --> 02:14:51,953
Man falls. Principles are compromised
and families are ruined!

1239
02:14:53,090 --> 02:14:58,050
But hearts in love have never
surrendered... they never will!

1240
02:15:11,908 --> 02:15:14,240
Tell me the whole story.
What actually happened?

1241
02:15:14,945 --> 02:15:16,776
Should I go and clear
your misunderstanding?

1242
02:15:17,147 --> 02:15:20,810
No point in going there
anymore, dad.

1243
02:15:21,318 --> 02:15:23,980
If you ever go there,
you'll have to cope with me.

1244
02:15:24,588 --> 02:15:26,385
My God! You're so angry?

1245
02:15:26,890 --> 02:15:29,791
Just angry?
I feel like killing Shekhar!

1246
02:15:32,562 --> 02:15:35,360
Here I am... please yourself.

1247
02:15:36,833 --> 02:15:40,166
Dad, ask him to get lost. I don't
even want to set eyes on him!

1248
02:15:42,405 --> 02:15:46,398
Dad, you must ask her
what mistake I have made.

1249
02:15:46,576 --> 02:15:48,168
My mother had fixed
my alliance elsewhere...

1250
02:15:48,345 --> 02:15:50,677
and those folks showed up suddenly.
What could I do?

1251
02:15:51,615 --> 02:15:53,845
He's right. What could the
poor chap have done?

1252
02:15:54,551 --> 02:15:57,577
Poor chap? Such poor chaps
ought to be poisoned!

1253
02:15:58,155 --> 02:15:59,417
Like a coward, he just watched.

1254
02:15:59,790 --> 02:16:03,021
He couldn't even tell her that
he loves me and wants to marry me!

1255
02:16:03,426 --> 02:16:05,656
Raj, calm down and...
- I'm leaving.

1256
02:16:06,029 --> 02:16:07,291
It's between the two of you.

1257
02:16:07,798 --> 02:16:10,596
Call me, if anyone of you
has a cracked skull.

1258
02:16:11,301 --> 02:16:14,828
Listen to me, Raj...
hear me out!

1259
02:16:19,609 --> 02:16:20,974
Raj...
- Go away!

1260
02:16:21,144 --> 02:16:23,806
Go away, I say!
- Why don't you understand?

1261
02:16:23,980 --> 02:16:25,572
Won't you leave?
- I won't!

1262
02:16:28,251 --> 02:16:32,347
What misbehavior is this?
Stop this childishness!

1263
02:16:46,736 --> 02:16:52,174
"I'll consider it a favor..."

1264
02:16:52,642 --> 02:16:57,841
"if you will let me
tell you how I feel"

1265
02:16:58,215 --> 02:17:04,085
"I'm in love with you"

1266
02:17:04,454 --> 02:17:08,788
"Let me remain in the
shelters of our love"

1267
02:17:09,092 --> 02:17:14,052
"I'll consider it a favor..."

1268
02:17:14,564 --> 02:17:19,763
"if you will let me
tell you how I feel"

1269
02:17:20,036 --> 02:17:25,997
"I'm in love with you"

1270
02:17:26,376 --> 02:17:30,813
"Let me remain in the
shelters of our love"

1271
02:17:31,181 --> 02:17:36,380
"I'll consider it
a favor to me..."

1272
02:17:54,204 --> 02:17:59,938
"You are the one who
taught me to laugh"

1273
02:18:02,279 --> 02:18:07,148
"You are the one who
taught me to laugh"

1274
02:18:07,951 --> 02:18:17,758
"I'll cry...
if you ask me to"

1275
02:18:18,995 --> 02:18:24,433
"For my tears, do not grieve..."

1276
02:18:24,801 --> 02:18:29,761
"they flow, let them flow"

1277
02:18:30,140 --> 02:18:36,010
"I'm in love with you"

1278
02:18:36,379 --> 02:18:40,816
"Give me the shelter of our love"

1279
02:18:41,084 --> 02:18:46,283
"lt'll be a favor to me..."

1280
02:18:58,702 --> 02:19:11,547
"Make me, if you will.
Or destroy me..."

1281
02:19:12,148 --> 02:19:22,388
"Even in death...
I'll wish you well"

1282
02:19:23,626 --> 02:19:28,962
"Every fleck of dust from
my remains will say..."

1283
02:19:29,332 --> 02:19:34,531
"this heartburn in love,
let me bear"

1284
02:19:34,804 --> 02:19:40,538
"For I'm in love with you"

1285
02:19:41,011 --> 02:19:45,573
"Give me the shelter of our love"

1286
02:19:45,849 --> 02:19:51,048
"A favor it will be to me..."

1287
02:19:51,855 --> 02:19:56,292
"let me tell you
what's in my heart"

1288
02:19:56,559 --> 02:20:02,520
"I'm in love with you"

1289
02:20:02,899 --> 02:20:06,995
"Let me remain in the
shelters of your love"

1290
02:20:07,637 --> 02:20:13,269
"I'll consider it a favor..."

1291
02:20:44,803 --> 02:20:47,271
Mom... haven't you gone to sleep?

1292
02:20:50,175 --> 02:20:52,643
Maybe I will never
be able to sleep again.

1293
02:20:56,514 --> 02:21:01,474
How can a mother go to sleep,
when the son she has brought up...

1294
02:21:01,753 --> 02:21:08,056
tells her that he's dead for her?

1295
02:21:22,340 --> 02:21:29,508
Why don't you understand, Mom?
I'm in love with that girl.

1296
02:21:29,981 --> 02:21:31,471
I've promised to marry her.

1297
02:21:33,918 --> 02:21:38,252
How about the promise your father
made, when you were still a child?

1298
02:21:39,624 --> 02:21:42,184
I can't sacrifice my love
for that promise.

1299
02:21:45,864 --> 02:21:49,630
And I will lay down my life to see
that the promise is kept, Shekhar.

1300
02:21:50,101 --> 02:21:50,829
Mom!

1301
02:21:53,071 --> 02:21:54,663
You can't do that, Mom!

1302
02:21:55,807 --> 02:21:57,832
In which case, you will
not marry this girl.

1303
02:21:59,310 --> 02:22:03,076
You will have to forget her.
- Do not be stubborn, Mom...

1304
02:22:03,348 --> 02:22:06,784
If you love that girl more
than you value my life...

1305
02:22:07,185 --> 02:22:15,217
remember something, Shekhar.
You will be marrying the girl...

1306
02:22:15,426 --> 02:22:17,860
and my body will be
taken away from this house.

1307
02:22:18,329 --> 02:22:21,560
Mom!
- I have decided, Shekhar.

1308
02:22:25,236 --> 02:22:28,763
Why are you bent on snatching
my happiness, Mom?

1309
02:22:29,707 --> 02:22:31,971
You won't really do that, will you?

1310
02:22:33,111 --> 02:22:35,136
You said all that in a
fit of rage, didn't you?

1311
02:22:36,915 --> 02:22:41,352
Shekhar, I will do
what I have said.

1312
02:22:51,896 --> 02:22:56,458
All right, Mom. If you have decided,
I will not marry that girl.

1313
02:23:01,206 --> 02:23:07,736
But I swear, I will not marry
any other girl either.

1314
02:24:28,059 --> 02:24:33,463
"I'll consider it a favor..."

1315
02:24:33,965 --> 02:24:39,267
"if you will let me
tell you how I feel"

1316
02:24:39,537 --> 02:24:45,498
"I'm in love with you"

1317
02:24:45,977 --> 02:24:50,073
"Let me remain in the
shelters of your love"

1318
02:24:50,915 --> 02:24:55,784
"I'll consider it
a favor to me..."

1319
02:24:56,321 --> 02:25:01,520
"if you will let me
tell you how I feel"

1320
02:25:01,859 --> 02:25:07,923
"I'm in love with you"

1321
02:25:08,299 --> 02:25:12,531
"Give me the shelter of our love"

1322
02:25:12,904 --> 02:25:18,103
"lt'll be a favor to me..."

1323
02:25:30,722 --> 02:25:43,692
"Make me, if you will.
Or destroy me..."

1324
02:25:44,302 --> 02:25:54,507
"Even in death...
I'll wish you well"

1325
02:25:55,546 --> 02:26:00,882
"Every fleck of dust from
my remains will say..."

1326
02:26:01,352 --> 02:26:06,449
"this heartburn in love,
let me bear"

1327
02:26:06,724 --> 02:26:12,458
"For I'm in love with you"

1328
02:26:12,964 --> 02:26:17,162
"Give me the shelter of our love"

1329
02:26:17,668 --> 02:26:22,867
"A favor it will be to me..."

1330
02:26:23,341 --> 02:26:28,301
"let me tell you
what's in my heart"

1331
02:26:28,579 --> 02:26:34,449
"I'm in love with you"

1332
02:26:34,919 --> 02:26:39,379
"Let me remain in the
shelters of your love"

1333
02:26:39,657 --> 02:26:45,618
"A favor it will be to me..."

1334
02:27:25,216 --> 02:27:26,240
What happened, father?

1335
02:27:27,518 --> 02:27:32,717
I've just met Shekhar's mother.
The situation is grim.

1336
02:27:34,192 --> 02:27:36,660
This wedding could be held up
for a long time.

1337
02:27:37,128 --> 02:27:39,062
What for?
- Any reason?

1338
02:27:39,998 --> 02:27:45,959
I think she has a valid reason.
She says she's doing her best...

1339
02:27:46,437 --> 02:27:49,668
but so long as
Shekhar loves that girl...

1340
02:27:50,274 --> 02:27:53,937
this wedding will not take place.
- We will be ruined by then.

1341
02:27:54,312 --> 02:27:58,646
Our creditors will not wait!
We will be imprisoned.

1342
02:27:59,350 --> 02:28:04,982
If we could somehow make Shekhar
hate that girl...

1343
02:28:05,690 --> 02:28:08,158
our task would be easy.
- What?

1344
02:28:09,193 --> 02:28:11,753
Hate that girl?
That's just what I wanted.

1345
02:28:21,005 --> 02:28:22,939
Let's go.
- Where are the two of you going?

1346
02:28:23,941 --> 02:28:26,739
To improve my lot.
And others' too. Let's go.

1347
02:28:41,893 --> 02:28:44,453
I have telephoned Shekhar.
Come with me.

1348
02:28:48,466 --> 02:28:53,426
I gain nothing. I'm suggesting this
only for your own welfare.

1349
02:28:54,138 --> 02:28:58,234
But it isn't my daughter's baby!
How can we say it is?

1350
02:28:59,077 --> 02:29:02,604
Or I'll be compelled to tell them
whose baby it is.

1351
02:29:03,548 --> 02:29:07,314
Whose is it?
- The one who bore it. Mala.

1352
02:29:08,586 --> 02:29:11,146
What will you gain by defaming
a decent girl?

1353
02:29:12,090 --> 02:29:17,289
Not much gain. But I'll get to see
a couple of murders.

1354
02:29:18,196 --> 02:29:20,562
The old lady will be enraged.
She will kill Mala.

1355
02:29:21,032 --> 02:29:23,523
She will kill the baby
and maybe Shekhar too...

1356
02:29:25,002 --> 02:29:27,903
No! That will never happen!
You can't do such a thing!

1357
02:29:29,474 --> 02:29:33,808
I'm capable of doing such a thing.
I sure am.

1358
02:29:34,178 --> 02:29:35,645
You're a mean and despicable man!

1359
02:29:36,247 --> 02:29:40,479
No. I'm only mean and despicable.
But I'm no man.

1360
02:29:42,487 --> 02:29:43,647
Looks like the old lady has arrived.

1361
02:29:44,122 --> 02:29:47,023
Remember... it's your baby!
Only yours!

1362
02:29:52,597 --> 02:29:53,427
Yes?

1363
02:29:59,270 --> 02:30:01,500
Tell me the truth.
Whose child is that?

1364
02:30:02,206 --> 02:30:04,470
What do you think?
- Rajkumar says...

1365
02:30:04,842 --> 02:30:08,505
it's your daughter's child.
- And you believe that child...

1366
02:30:08,713 --> 02:30:12,114
belongs to this innocent girl?
- That's what I'm here to ask.

1367
02:30:13,050 --> 02:30:14,415
What brings you to Bombay?

1368
02:30:15,119 --> 02:30:18,247
And what does the child mean to you?
- It means a lot...

1369
02:30:18,623 --> 02:30:21,524
what I regret is that
I can't answer you.

1370
02:30:23,094 --> 02:30:25,028
So you agree that it's
your daughter's child?

1371
02:30:30,101 --> 02:30:33,127
Why don't you give us an answer?
You cannot!

1372
02:30:34,605 --> 02:30:39,372
You must concede that you tried to
ensnare my son for our riches!

1373
02:30:40,945 --> 02:30:44,381
But God and the principles
of my family have saved us!

1374
02:30:45,082 --> 02:30:49,212
Or else, this loose-morale girl
could've been my daughter-in-law!

1375
02:30:50,655 --> 02:30:52,816
Our family would've been
wiped out!

1376
02:30:53,958 --> 02:30:56,324
By God! I can't remain
silent any longer!

1377
02:30:56,694 --> 02:31:01,222
No, father... don't.
I'll give her an answer.

1378
02:31:04,435 --> 02:31:07,029
Yes, this is my child.

1379
02:31:09,807 --> 02:31:10,865
Hear that, Mother?

1380
02:31:13,311 --> 02:31:16,769
I already knew it's your child.

1381
02:31:17,815 --> 02:31:21,478
And now I realize what
brought you here!

1382
02:31:21,953 --> 02:31:24,319
Wealth! Your lust for money!

1383
02:31:24,689 --> 02:31:28,352
Here's a hundred thousand rupees.
Take it, and get lost!

1384
02:31:28,826 --> 02:31:29,554
Mom...

1385
02:31:30,061 --> 02:31:32,086
Look at this girl, Shekhar!

1386
02:31:32,663 --> 02:31:35,689
She's the one you were
leaving your mother for.

1387
02:31:36,400 --> 02:31:39,631
The one you were severing your
relations with the family for!

1388
02:31:40,238 --> 02:31:44,334
She's the one who was seducing you
for a fistful of gold!

1389
02:31:46,244 --> 02:31:49,577
This immoral girl is
the mother of a child!

1390
02:31:50,948 --> 02:31:56,580
Lmpossible! It can't be true, Mom!
- She has already admitted it, Shekhar.

1391
02:31:57,388 --> 02:31:58,548
Ask her if you wish to.

1392
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,127
I've already said it.
This is my child.

1393
02:32:11,736 --> 02:32:14,500
No, Raj. You're hiding
something from me.

1394
02:32:15,006 --> 02:32:16,598
Tell me the truth, Raj!

1395
02:32:17,174 --> 02:32:18,573
Why can't you believe it, Shekhar?

1396
02:32:23,848 --> 02:32:27,648
I believe more in Raj than
I believe in myself, Mom.

1397
02:32:28,786 --> 02:32:32,222
No, this can't be Raj's baby.
- This is my baby, Shekhar.

1398
02:32:33,824 --> 02:32:35,519
Really?

1399
02:32:37,762 --> 02:32:41,425
Take my hand and swear it on me!
Is it really your baby?

1400
02:32:58,215 --> 02:33:00,911
Why don't you speak?
Why are you quiet?

1401
02:33:02,586 --> 02:33:03,951
Why don't you look at me?

1402
02:33:04,755 --> 02:33:05,483
Speak!

1403
02:33:12,296 --> 02:33:20,135
Don't do it, Raj. No false oaths
on the one you love.

1404
02:33:21,272 --> 02:33:23,069
Tell them whose baby it is.

1405
02:33:27,712 --> 02:33:32,479
How will a decent girl like you
say anything ill for anyone?

1406
02:33:35,052 --> 02:33:36,747
Mother, this is my baby.

1407
02:33:41,392 --> 02:33:45,055
What? Your baby?
- Yes.

1408
02:33:46,297 --> 02:33:48,322
It was born of your false pride...

1409
02:33:49,700 --> 02:33:56,663
of your misplaced notions
of inequality and status!

1410
02:33:57,375 --> 02:34:03,871
Which means you have brought
disgrace to the family name!

1411
02:34:04,482 --> 02:34:07,918
Without even marrying,
you bore this bundle of sin!

1412
02:34:08,586 --> 02:34:12,579
It isn't born of sin. The two of us
were secretly married.

1413
02:34:13,624 --> 02:34:15,319
We kept it a secret because
we were scared of you.

1414
02:34:15,826 --> 02:34:19,922
But we have to tell you today that
it is our child. I'm the father.

1415
02:34:20,965 --> 02:34:23,866
You're lying!
- I'm not. I'm speaking the truth.

1416
02:34:24,568 --> 02:34:27,799
Take a look at this marriage
certificate, if you can't believe me.

1417
02:34:28,706 --> 02:34:30,105
We were married two years ago.

1418
02:34:30,674 --> 02:34:33,700
Mala, you got married secretly!

1419
02:34:34,412 --> 02:34:36,539
That too, to such a
poor and lowly man!

1420
02:34:37,348 --> 02:34:39,714
There are decent people
even among the poor, mom.

1421
02:34:40,084 --> 02:34:44,418
They are human too.
They have dreams and aspirations.

1422
02:34:45,022 --> 02:34:47,490
Had you not weighed decency in the
scales of wealth and status...

1423
02:34:48,192 --> 02:34:52,629
Mala would have had a grand wedding
in our very house.

1424
02:34:53,230 --> 02:34:56,534
There would have been
a band playing, Mom!

1425
02:34:56,534 --> 02:35:01,301
Amidst the music, the principles of
the family would have been killed.

1426
02:35:02,206 --> 02:35:04,367
Our reputation would be
rendered to dust!

1427
02:35:05,943 --> 02:35:07,968
I will never forgive Mala
for what she has done!

1428
02:35:08,779 --> 02:35:11,339
She has made no mistake, Mom.
You have!

1429
02:35:11,749 --> 02:35:15,310
You were blind! All your life, you
spoke only about your principles!

1430
02:35:15,786 --> 02:35:17,583
You gave the misplaced rules
of the family...

1431
02:35:17,855 --> 02:35:19,254
a more exalted place
than even the Holy Texts!

1432
02:35:20,057 --> 02:35:23,618
You must have realized today that it
isn't your family that is principled!

1433
02:35:23,994 --> 02:35:26,792
It's these poor folks! To save
your family honor...

1434
02:35:27,064 --> 02:35:29,532
they were sacrificing
their own happiness!

1435
02:35:30,334 --> 02:35:34,327
And look at this girl!
She knows I don't want to marry her.

1436
02:35:35,139 --> 02:35:38,802
She knows I hate the sight of her.
But for money...

1437
02:35:39,210 --> 02:35:41,542
only for the sake of money,
she's ruining our lives!

1438
02:35:43,881 --> 02:35:47,681
Nobody moves.
Else, you'll regret it.

1439
02:35:51,021 --> 02:35:56,084
You were right, Shekhar.
Everything we did was for the money.

1440
02:35:56,527 --> 02:35:58,654
This one hundred thousand is the
compensation for breaking the marriage.

1441
02:35:59,129 --> 02:36:02,690
You will pay us so much more
for our broken dreams.

1442
02:36:03,834 --> 02:36:08,271
Should you not have the cash now...
you may sign this document.

1443
02:36:11,842 --> 02:36:15,505
Hold it. It's not our policy
to owe people money.

1444
02:36:16,013 --> 02:36:17,412
Here it is. Give it to him.

1445
02:36:57,421 --> 02:36:57,910
No.

1446
02:36:58,923 --> 02:37:00,857
It's against our principles.

1447
02:38:50,100 --> 02:38:51,260
Get him!

1448
02:39:45,222 --> 02:39:48,487
Raj, go and bring Shekhar.

1449
02:39:50,694 --> 02:39:52,719
Tell him that I have called him.

1450
02:39:55,733 --> 02:39:57,428
Give me the baby.

1451
02:40:17,387 --> 02:40:21,289
What happened to you?
Get up!

1452
02:40:29,533 --> 02:40:31,660
"Call me a beast, if you will"

1453
02:40:32,369 --> 02:40:35,065
"Call me what you will"

1454
02:40:35,773 --> 02:40:39,231
"I'm caught in the storm of love"

1455
02:40:39,476 --> 02:40:41,967
"What can I do?"

1456
02:40:42,446 --> 02:40:45,779
"Call me a beast, if you will"
