2
00:00:23,695 --> 00:00:30,027
And if we leave out the starter? We do even a cocktail beforehand.

3
00:00:30,153 --> 00:00:33,443
Maybe we can go directly to the main course.

4
00:00:33,569 --> 00:00:38,652
We are already in the highest price range. -No, it's not, though.

5
00:00:38,778 --> 00:00:41,944
You're in the standard price category.

6
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,819
But we can come up with something on the starter.

7
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:47,985
Then we make it lighter.

8
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:50,653
Cheaper, so? -Lighter.

9
00:00:53,195 --> 00:00:55,985
And then the photographer.

10
00:00:56,111 --> 00:01:01,527
If we leave out the white border around the pictures, the price dropped something?

11
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:04,527
Remove the white border? -Yes.

12
00:01:04,653 --> 00:01:09,069
I'll check it out. I'm not sure if it can, though.

13
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:10,945
Excuse me.

14
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,819
Yes, Adele?

15
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:19,778
Keep it brief, because I am with difficult customers.

16
00:01:21,153 --> 00:01:25,485
Have you been to unload? Why the tableware is not there?

17
00:01:25,611 --> 00:01:28,985
Where is Nabil? -Talk to him.

18
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:32,070
I leave it to you. See you soon.

19
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:38,818
Apologize. -We need to talk about the flowers.

20
00:01:38,944 --> 00:01:43,360
Maybe make that orchids the whole something too expensive.

21
00:01:43,486 --> 00:01:49,360
I've been a few times in price. I want to be best one more time to look into it.

22
00:01:49,486 --> 00:01:53,402
That would be fine, honestly. -I thought so.

23
00:01:53,528 --> 00:01:57,819
I often tell my clients that they have a wonderful place.

24
00:01:57,945 --> 00:02:01,652
The heart of Paris, a luxury hotel. With 200 guests.

25
00:02:01,778 --> 00:02:05,610
It's something big. A wedding, no fair.

26
00:02:05,736 --> 00:02:10,152
Then you want a certain level. And there comes at a price.

27
00:02:10,278 --> 00:02:12,235
I can't keep bags.

28
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:16,485
We don't know if you really want to search with us for solutions.

29
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:21,902
Is that so? Yet I was always there to assist you.

30
00:02:22,028 --> 00:02:25,819
We find you not as resourceful.

31
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:29,153
Yes, that's right. You are not as resourceful.

32
00:02:29,403 --> 00:02:33,152
Resourceful? I understand.

33
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:37,361
There suddenly shoot me something invention to State within.

34
00:02:40,445 --> 00:02:43,110
We let the Starter sit.

35
00:02:43,236 --> 00:02:46,152
Fine. -That is a good idea.

36
00:02:46,278 --> 00:02:49,236
But then we also do no main course.

37
00:02:50,445 --> 00:02:52,277
And now I am resourceful.

38
00:02:52,403 --> 00:02:56,069
Ask the people to Tupperware containers to carry.

39
00:02:56,195 --> 00:03:00,277
Grated carrots, boiled eggs. A salad of home.

40
00:03:00,403 --> 00:03:05,860
Ask someone to take another beer and lemonade, for a Panaché.

41
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,819
Listen ...-hold on.

42
00:03:07,945 --> 00:03:10,235
For the decoration, I know something.

43
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:14,569
My niece makes garlands of Orange-green crepe paper.

44
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:18,652
That we put on the table or we stick to the seats.

45
00:03:18,778 --> 00:03:21,152
You very cynical on the barrel.

46
00:03:21,278 --> 00:03:24,194
Sorry, I'm not there yet. For dessert:

47
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,277
We can do without the Petit Fours. Forget them.

48
00:03:29,403 --> 00:03:35,110
Instead: fruit compote. Apple-PEAR, Apple-Strawberry, Apple-banana.

49
00:03:35,236 --> 00:03:39,152
Served in cups with ... How welcome those small ...

50
00:03:39,278 --> 00:03:41,236
Cats tongues. -Yes, that.

51
00:03:41,403 --> 00:03:45,360
And then unlimited. Is that not resourceful?

52
00:03:45,486 --> 00:03:51,485
I have possibly still more ideas. Then you come in the lowest price range.

53
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:53,027
Lower can not.

54
00:03:53,153 --> 00:03:56,819
Well, we will think about it.

55
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:01,277
Sorry, I let myself go a little. -You will be hearing from us.

56
00:04:01,403 --> 00:04:06,277
I will create a new quote. Also over those white edges.

57
00:04:06,403 --> 00:04:07,945
Thanks. -See you soon.

58
00:04:13,236 --> 00:04:14,819
It can not be otherwise.

59
00:04:14,945 --> 00:04:19,402
I had to leave the truck and wait for Seb's.

60
00:04:19,528 --> 00:04:24,652
I have already told Adele. Talk to each other.

61
00:04:24,778 --> 00:04:29,945
Grégoire, I got your message about the acquisition. Valérie Laprade so.

62
00:04:30,111 --> 00:04:32,902
They could come tonight.

63
00:04:33,028 --> 00:04:35,694
And my wife really draws well.

64
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,027
Our relationship has just grown cold here.

65
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:43,694
Nicole me. A few things you should know.

66
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,111
I just talked Grégoire. The acquisition is almost complete.

67
00:04:48,278 --> 00:04:53,902
There is a lady along to watch. I'm in there.

68
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:57,444
Nabil, that agent has withheld my license.

69
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,860
Seb gets the truck.

70
00:04:59,986 --> 00:05:03,195
I'll get my brother, and I'll see you there.

71
00:05:08,903 --> 00:05:10,736
Then get in too.

72
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,735
What is this car? - My driver's license has been withheld.

73
00:05:22,861 --> 00:05:24,903
I'm waiting for an hour.

74
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:31,486
Are you in your pajamas? Now do it fur.

75
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:35,110
Dress you no longer work for you?

76
00:05:35,236 --> 00:05:40,527
It's no pajamas, but between pants. For home, but ...

77
00:05:40,653 --> 00:05:42,195
This is a pajama.

78
00:05:45,528 --> 00:05:47,445
Good gracious. - Do not be silly.

79
00:06:04,528 --> 00:06:07,444
Want a wedding without music?

80
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:13,360
We have to unload three trucks. And 15 crates of champagne. That makes sense.

81
00:06:13,486 --> 00:06:17,944
You do not know what makes sense. With your bad bomberjackje.

82
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,902
Better than that ugly outfit of yours.

83
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:24,195
What is it? - Someone needs to teach her a lesson.

84
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:27,070
Bring it on. - Quiet, Adele.

85
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:29,903
Teach me a lesson!

86
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,027
She always looks at me.

87
00:06:32,153 --> 00:06:37,194
They occupy the elevator for three hours. And we? they sometimes take precedence?

88
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,819
We take us a break on the stairs. Here, look.

89
00:06:40,945 --> 00:06:46,277
Should I cry now? Stop it. - You do not get it, pancake.

90
00:06:46,403 --> 00:06:49,985
Am I a pancake? - Hold still now agree on.

91
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:54,027
I'm not a pancake. - Nobody is a pancake here.

92
00:06:54,153 --> 00:06:58,194
You organize and get started. Forward.

93
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,028
How? - Frankie, hold the freight elevator.

94
00:07:03,986 --> 00:07:06,278
IT'S LIFE!

95
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:14,736
Go cry to your mama. - Leave her out. Fuck you, dick.

96
00:07:16,778 --> 00:07:21,527
I can not tolerate this behavior, Adele. Not really.

97
00:07:21,653 --> 00:07:24,444
How often do I have to tell you?

98
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,319
You're arguing with anyone.

99
00:07:27,445 --> 00:07:32,110
And you kaffert everyone. You understand, right?

100
00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:34,944
There's always something with his band.

101
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,902
They pretend they are big stars.

102
00:07:38,028 --> 00:07:43,194
They do weddings, just like us. We are not their slaves. I do not pull it.

103
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,860
They really show no respect, no decency.

104
00:07:47,986 --> 00:07:50,694
Stop your respect and decency.

105
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,985
DJ Fab would actually come.

106
00:07:53,111 --> 00:07:56,485
He is ill. James replaces him.

107
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:58,610
He's a little strange.

108
00:07:58,736 --> 00:08:02,985
What do we do then? We ... - Passing us.

109
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:06,318
We remain calm and adapt.

110
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,027
You give the wrong example.

111
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:12,527
You represent me if I'm not there.

112
00:08:12,653 --> 00:08:17,402
You wanted more autonomy. You just wanted to do it again.

113
00:08:17,528 --> 00:08:23,110
You think I'm stuck with whatever you spouting?

114
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:27,486
"Fuck you, dick." Is that how you represent me?

115
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,735
Are you listening? - Yes Yes.

116
00:08:31,861 --> 00:08:36,944
If you want higher, you have to change. - He is right. You're rude.

117
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,610
Get out, you.

118
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:44,610
Much better. An improvement. You're really on the right track.

119
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:47,527
There is nothing analogous.

120
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:50,402
Sharpness, grain depth.

121
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:53,569
Digital is faster, but has drawbacks.

122
00:08:53,695 --> 00:08:58,360
Are you tonight? - No, I want to buy the castle.

123
00:08:58,486 --> 00:09:02,777
Witty, though. Do not you think? We have to.

124
00:09:02,903 --> 00:09:05,860
This is Bastien, my intern.

125
00:09:05,986 --> 00:09:09,152
He walks a week with me to learn the trade.

126
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:13,527
They are the waiters. - Maîtres d'hôtel.

127
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:17,320
Seb one Henri. - Hello.

128
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,652
He's annoying. - Now I remember.

129
00:09:22,778 --> 00:09:27,444
You should be kind in this box. That's why people like me.

130
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,652
When you greet someone, then call his name.

131
00:09:31,778 --> 00:09:33,610
That always works well.

132
00:09:33,736 --> 00:09:37,110
Three at the bar, four outside. - Seb does the bar.

133
00:09:37,236 --> 00:09:41,110
Mustache could not today. - Dan Henry and Nico doing the dining room.

134
00:09:41,236 --> 00:09:46,735
Roshan and the extra power do the dishes. And where is Patrice?

135
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:49,694
I do not know if he's here.

136
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,903
He always says what you already know.

137
00:09:57,028 --> 00:10:01,735
We make signs, so I put on Patrice Julien.

138
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:05,027
Mirko missing. I never know with him.

139
00:10:05,153 --> 00:10:07,152
Is he there? - Yes.

140
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:10,820
He's gone. Adele sent him home.

141
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,736
Nabil roep Adele.

142
00:10:16,653 --> 00:10:20,153
What did you think? I shout anything in his ear?

143
00:10:22,486 --> 00:10:24,361
My God, man.

144
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:30,361
Everything good?

145
00:10:31,486 --> 00:10:33,361
Yes of course.

146
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,570
That you do not believe.

147
00:10:40,695 --> 00:10:44,485
These are the dishwashers. Very sympathetic. I introduce you.

148
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:46,570
This is Roshan.

149
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,069
Hello, Hriosn.

150
00:10:49,195 --> 00:10:53,194
And what's your name again? - Kathirkamanathan Pillai.

151
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,320
Then you just say 'hello'. - Hello, Kathirkamanathan Pillai.

152
00:11:00,986 --> 00:11:02,777
We are going to prepare.

153
00:11:02,903 --> 00:11:06,694
You're doing well, but it looks like you 'mallo "says.

154
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,278
No, I'm mallo.

155
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:10,569
Say 'savory'. - Martig.

156
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:14,610
The photographer was a friend of the boss. He's a little strange.

157
00:11:14,736 --> 00:11:18,360
And the other with the duster on his head?

158
00:11:18,486 --> 00:11:20,236
His son might.

159
00:11:22,445 --> 00:11:25,445
Do Mirko sent home? - Yes.

160
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,944
You texted: "Dismiss Mirko."

161
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:33,985
I know very well what I sent: "Go for Mirko."

162
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:39,444
I sent him home because there was' Dismiss Mirko. Watch.

163
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:45,027
Why he made it? That's not what I meant.

164
00:11:45,153 --> 00:11:47,319
It read: Dismiss Mirko.

165
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:52,277
Yes, I know that now. He changed my words ever.

166
00:11:52,403 --> 00:11:54,902
We do not understand your text messages more often.

167
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:57,860
Last sent you: "Thank you for the massage."

168
00:11:57,986 --> 00:12:02,277
That's stupid autocorrect. And I can not find the punctuation.

169
00:12:02,403 --> 00:12:07,694
Increasingly those idiotic yellow circles with their tongues out and their sunglasses.

170
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,902
Smileys. - The yes.

171
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:15,110
Mirko is worthless. He never takes on and is always late.

172
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:18,778
Now I come too short a waiter. - I thought so too.

173
00:12:19,195 --> 00:12:23,527
But I took the initiative. Acted autonomously.

174
00:12:23,653 --> 00:12:26,695
I called a replacement. - Very well.

175
00:12:27,361 --> 00:12:32,403
I want to first see him here. - Okay, but he wants on the payroll.

176
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,860
Just kidding. That face, priceless.

177
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:45,402
Very comical. - That face that he drew, Josiane.

178
00:12:45,528 --> 00:12:47,653
She pulls me ...

179
00:12:51,653 --> 00:12:53,070
Josiane.

180
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:00,527
What is it? We would see each other yesterday?

181
00:13:00,653 --> 00:13:04,152
I did not want to. I do not feel like it anymore.

182
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:07,361
You are joking. - Do I look like this?

183
00:13:08,403 --> 00:13:11,860
What is wrong? - I've said it a hundred times.

184
00:13:11,986 --> 00:13:14,735
I'm fed up with it. I want to be free again.

185
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:18,360
You know how I feel about you. I'm trying.

186
00:13:18,486 --> 00:13:23,194
You do nothing. You do not at your best. Go for it or not.

187
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,735
I'm looking for the right moment to talk to her.

188
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:30,861
For you it's easy. One day at her, the other with me. And I?

189
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:35,569
Sign but if you talked to her.

190
00:13:35,695 --> 00:13:40,570
Just send a text message. There you still am so good at?

191
00:13:47,986 --> 00:13:52,069
So everything is ready. Tables, linen, buffet.

192
00:13:52,195 --> 00:13:54,610
And guess what, when the party begins!

193
00:13:54,736 --> 00:13:57,902
Blow out. - I'm about to tell you something.

194
00:13:58,028 --> 00:13:59,778
What do we see?

195
00:14:00,736 --> 00:14:03,527
Whose birthday was it? - No idea.

196
00:14:03,653 --> 00:14:08,152
To a dog. - You mean 'a dog'?

197
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:13,777
You celebrate the birthday of a dog. To a dog 'true linguistic not.

198
00:14:13,903 --> 00:14:16,485
Do you understand? - So there we were ...

199
00:14:16,611 --> 00:14:20,735
Oh no. A costume party? - With wigs and everything. Really shit.

200
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:24,027
Max is the pot, I do not wear a wig. - Calm.

201
00:14:24,153 --> 00:14:27,235
If he's there, I'll talk to him.

202
00:14:27,361 --> 00:14:30,278
Do that, because this is ...

203
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:36,194
Henri, we rely on you. You should really talk to him, okay?

204
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,236
I have a really great trick.

205
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:45,070
It's not a bird, but their family. A kind of cousin. Three two one...

206
00:14:46,403 --> 00:14:48,111
A ninny.

207
00:14:49,986 --> 00:14:51,860
What's up, guys?

208
00:14:51,986 --> 00:14:55,528
Why are you always late? - My service was out.

209
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:59,319
Along the road was blocked by striking farmers.

210
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:04,735
Delays on the A15 at Franconville, direction Montigny. At junction ...

211
00:15:04,861 --> 00:15:08,152
So you give us an update traffic?

212
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:10,985
Max, Nico wants to say something.

213
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:14,444
Yes, Nico? - No, it was Henri.

214
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:18,569
I listen, Henri, but fast. - Hi, Max.

215
00:15:18,695 --> 00:15:23,027
It's all about ... We were thinking ...

216
00:15:23,153 --> 00:15:26,277
We have not met. - But talk.

217
00:15:26,403 --> 00:15:28,527
And we agree ...

218
00:15:28,653 --> 00:15:34,110
It is the way we get a little ...

219
00:15:34,236 --> 00:15:38,694
Go on, Henry. - Yes Yes. With respect to...

220
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,110
Overall, it's all going very well.

221
00:15:43,236 --> 00:15:46,153
Yes, of course. But?

222
00:15:50,903 --> 00:15:53,944
Nothing so? - No nothing.

223
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:57,527
Consider now what you want to say, it is more convenient.

224
00:15:57,653 --> 00:16:01,070
We are behind the mise-en-place. To work.

225
00:16:01,236 --> 00:16:02,861
I'll hear from you.

226
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:08,194
You said that right. He really understood.

227
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,777
This was not the time. I know Max. I say it at a better time.

228
00:16:13,903 --> 00:16:18,152
Watch your reps. - Be my back repeatedly, you.

229
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:23,069
Follow the wall. Do not you see the water? - Yes, I see water everywhere.

230
00:16:23,195 --> 00:16:25,360
I'm already there.

231
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:30,069
I told you you had to shave. Come well, you said.

232
00:16:30,195 --> 00:16:33,652
I had to stop by my uncle to borrow a device.

233
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:37,360
I've got everything. Even a pack. - Damn, Samy.

234
00:16:37,486 --> 00:16:41,818
I have someone sent away for you. Do a bit of your best.

235
00:16:41,944 --> 00:16:45,860
This is pretty ropey. - I'm here.

236
00:16:45,986 --> 00:16:49,569
Explain to me what I should do and what it pays.

237
00:16:49,736 --> 00:16:51,402
It is something extra.

238
00:16:51,528 --> 00:16:53,861
Thank you. - No, stupid.

239
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:57,318
That means you're an extra help.

240
00:16:57,444 --> 00:17:00,194
I thought ... - I'll explain.

241
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,027
If you do well, you may come in the regular brigade.

242
00:17:05,153 --> 00:17:06,778
Which brigade?

243
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:15,653
I had another question: what pays? - The first half of your job voluntarily.

244
00:17:18,986 --> 00:17:23,652
That head of yours. One hundred euro per night. - That is not wrong.

245
00:17:23,778 --> 00:17:28,110
Go anywhere you shave. Hurry up. - Thank you, Adele.

246
00:17:28,236 --> 00:17:30,277
Again with me, Nicole.

247
00:17:30,403 --> 00:17:33,653
Please call me. It is important.

248
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,027
Maximum recording time reaches.

249
00:17:36,153 --> 00:17:38,819
We have a big problem. - Tell.

250
00:17:38,945 --> 00:17:43,194
The classification. The table names are all wrong.

251
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,694
You call that a big deal? - Yes.

252
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,819
They are works of Romain Gary Emile Ajar ...

253
00:17:48,945 --> 00:17:51,945
and then suddenly Le Voyageur imprudent.

254
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,360
That does not Romain Gary, but Barjavel.

255
00:17:56,486 --> 00:18:01,944
What makes the hell out, Julien? Gary, Ajar, Barjavel three writers.

256
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:08,694
No, because Gary and Ajar is the same. - I know, I'm not stupid.

257
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,694
Good. But that must otherwise.

258
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,860
Here you come in. - That's the kids' table.

259
00:18:15,986 --> 00:18:20,694
A detail. Nobody cares anything. - Me. Sorry.

260
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,235
It is simply not coherent.

261
00:18:23,361 --> 00:18:29,319
Then make it coherent, if it bothers you so and then continue.

262
00:18:29,445 --> 00:18:32,569
That's my suggestion.

263
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,861
Are you in for it? - Yes.

264
00:18:36,236 --> 00:18:40,402
I think we have really solved a big problem.

265
00:18:40,528 --> 00:18:42,028
Super.

266
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:47,778
Because it is Ajar ...

267
00:18:48,778 --> 00:18:51,445
That's why I ... - It's getting better.

268
00:18:53,236 --> 00:18:57,985
Every wedding is different. So each site is different.

269
00:18:58,111 --> 00:19:01,570
Therefore, you must find the correct position.

270
00:19:01,736 --> 00:19:08,235
And that is of course not easy. There is need for experience. A nose.

271
00:19:08,361 --> 00:19:11,652
Are you the one who spreads such a smell?

272
00:19:11,778 --> 00:19:14,527
It smells like caramel. - No, pomme d'amour.

273
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:18,485
Say hello to Max. - Hello, Max.

274
00:19:18,611 --> 00:19:22,195
Just look around and then come back.

275
00:19:23,653 --> 00:19:28,235
He runs an internship at me. - Good of you. He's comical.

276
00:19:28,361 --> 00:19:32,402
I have lost something, Max. I'm currently tight in the work.

277
00:19:32,528 --> 00:19:34,277
Currently? - Yes.

278
00:19:34,403 --> 00:19:36,944
So if you still have some work for me.

279
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:41,485
And tonight? - Yes. You're the only one who hires me.

280
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:46,694
Exactly. But I will not always be there. - Why do you say that?

281
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,610
How is your mother? - Worse.

282
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:54,235
Did you know that she is living with me? - No.

283
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:57,152
She can not walk. - Shit.

284
00:19:57,278 --> 00:20:00,277
You know what they said last time? "Who is Max?"

285
00:20:00,403 --> 00:20:04,235
Her memory lets her down. - That still.

286
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:07,486
How old is she now? - 96.

287
00:20:09,028 --> 00:20:12,152
She had a beautiful life. - How so?

288
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:15,069
Do you think she should die? - Not at all.

289
00:20:15,195 --> 00:20:17,403
I have not got all day, Guy.

290
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:24,360
This is not a station. Take the stairs.

291
00:20:24,486 --> 00:20:28,819
It takes time. - That's not my problem anyway.

292
00:20:28,945 --> 00:20:32,570
Bernard say, what about the strawberry cake?

293
00:20:32,736 --> 00:20:35,985
State on the menu? - Which strawberry cake?

294
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:42,235
Keep up with me. Birthdays, candles blow out, that's not for me.

295
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:44,236
Sweet of you, but no.

296
00:20:44,445 --> 00:20:48,194
Oh no. That's a student of mine exercises.

297
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,235
I had no idea you were birthday. Congratulations.

298
00:20:52,361 --> 00:20:58,235
No kiss. Why do you do that? Now everyone thinks why they kiss?

299
00:20:58,361 --> 00:21:04,528
Excuse me. I did not know. Congrats. - Tell me now not ever.

300
00:21:06,903 --> 00:21:10,985
What happened to your face? - As a waiter looks.

301
00:21:11,111 --> 00:21:16,360
Now come with me. Hurry up. - They also look out at the steakhouse.

302
00:21:16,486 --> 00:21:19,861
And your shirt is wrinkled. - Stop it.

303
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:25,152
What is he going to ask me? - Nothing. Just a few questions.

304
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:31,110
I said you had experience. If you do not know, you just invent something.

305
00:21:31,236 --> 00:21:33,235
Still, there he is. - I said nothing.

306
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:38,194
I can not take on more staff. Find a trainee.

307
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,402
This is Samy. He replaces Mirko.

308
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,860
Mr. Angeli, or Max.

309
00:21:44,986 --> 00:21:50,110
Adele said you had experience. - Yes, soon-soon.

310
00:21:50,236 --> 00:21:52,569
How do you mean? - Fast.

311
00:21:52,695 --> 00:21:56,402
Fast food, you mean? - Yes, exactly.

312
00:21:56,528 --> 00:21:58,486
In which house?

313
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:05,069
I worked more in restaurants than in homes.

314
00:22:05,195 --> 00:22:09,235
Can you clean a tongue or a wolf?

315
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:11,194
A catfish?

316
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,236
Or a turbot? - I'm pretty technically minded.

317
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:21,860
We serve meat tonight anyway. - Say Patrice accompanies him.

318
00:22:21,986 --> 00:22:26,652
Get those whiskers off. And do not sleep in your shirt.

319
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:29,527
I had already said. I told you.

320
00:22:29,653 --> 00:22:33,569
Josiane says the customer is five minutes.

321
00:22:33,695 --> 00:22:36,235
Roshan, kom mee.

322
00:22:36,361 --> 00:22:40,235
Do not you know anything? Turbot is a fish.

323
00:22:40,361 --> 00:22:43,319
I see. I understood it all out.

324
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,695
As sole and catfish. That fish.

325
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,027
Catfish fish is?

326
00:22:50,153 --> 00:22:54,277
I go to the customer. Come over five minutes to me.

327
00:22:54,403 --> 00:22:58,610
What should I say? - Invent anything. An excuse.

328
00:22:58,736 --> 00:23:04,069
Every time you see me with him, you should disturb us.

329
00:23:04,195 --> 00:23:08,194
Otherwise, I can not get out. He's a bit ...

330
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,861
In five minutes.

331
00:23:16,653 --> 00:23:19,527
Hello, Pierre. Congratulations. - Unbelievable.

332
00:23:19,653 --> 00:23:23,069
Just today they run hard to do.

333
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:26,860
What time is it? - Five hours, everything is under control.

334
00:23:26,986 --> 00:23:29,819
Silent. I'm on the phone.

335
00:23:29,945 --> 00:23:32,819
Keep me informed, we call yet.

336
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:34,903
Issues?

337
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,402
My husband's family is common for farmers.

338
00:23:38,528 --> 00:23:44,569
Oh, that's on the A15. Near Herblay, but solves it up again at the node.

339
00:23:44,695 --> 00:23:47,195
I asked for a traffic update?

340
00:23:51,361 --> 00:23:54,819
Is this the flower decoration? - Yes.

341
00:23:54,945 --> 00:23:57,444
I did not expect this.

342
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:00,153
Not? - I saw something else for me.

343
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,319
I did exactly what you said in your letter.

344
00:24:03,445 --> 00:24:07,152
A letter? - Yes, about the importance of timing.

345
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:09,152
It was an e-mail.

346
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:13,277
No, yes, electronic mail. - That's not a letter.

347
00:24:13,403 --> 00:24:19,195
Anyway. My speech has become slightly longer, so keep that in mind.

348
00:24:19,403 --> 00:24:23,528
Is that your speech? Are not your memoirs?

349
00:24:24,736 --> 00:24:29,235
So we have to change the schedule. - Yeah, that'll be fine.

350
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:34,610
I let them know the band and then we fit in.

351
00:24:34,736 --> 00:24:40,444
It will then be quite tight. Because you are so hammered on in there ...

352
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,277
Your letter.

353
00:24:42,403 --> 00:24:45,777
Electronic mail. E-mail.

354
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:48,527
But you're not listening at all.

355
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:53,028
I'm glad you're working tonight. You are so nice.

356
00:24:57,528 --> 00:25:01,069
What is that? Is Fab? - Yes.

357
00:25:01,195 --> 00:25:05,194
Actually not. Has changed something small.

358
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,069
This is James.

359
00:25:07,195 --> 00:25:10,860
Fab could not, so James will perform tonight.

360
00:25:10,986 --> 00:25:13,444
Are you serious? You had advised Fab.

361
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:17,402
I chose the Fab Four Live Band DJ Plus.

362
00:25:17,528 --> 00:25:21,819
This is the same formula. Same genre, they work together.

363
00:25:21,945 --> 00:25:25,278
Dit is de James Five Star Blend Four.

364
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:30,152
I know damn nothing.

365
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,444
He scares me.

366
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:36,444
I wanted understated, chic and elegant. - That's it.

367
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:39,485
James is very understated.

368
00:25:39,611 --> 00:25:45,027
You know how long I prepared for this? I do not want Patrick Sébastien tonight.

369
00:25:45,153 --> 00:25:50,527
No silly fuss. And no napkins in the air.

370
00:25:50,653 --> 00:25:53,027
That's not what he ...

371
00:25:53,153 --> 00:25:56,277
This is very annoying. Why I did not know this?

372
00:25:56,403 --> 00:25:59,485
Mr. Max? - I'm busy, can not you see?

373
00:25:59,611 --> 00:26:03,445
I can not think of anything. - Excuse me, you know.

374
00:26:04,445 --> 00:26:09,444
It took an hour. Five minutes, I said. Where have you been?

375
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:12,820
I've looked everywhere for an excuse.

376
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,444
Quiet, James. Brul not.

377
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:28,527
I do not roar, I warm my voice up. - Later you'm completely lost.

378
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:34,319
I do not know if you know, but the customer wants it understated, chic and comfortable.

379
00:26:34,445 --> 00:26:36,653
Pleasant? - Yes.

380
00:27:05,528 --> 00:27:07,111
Excuse me.

381
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:12,195
Unbelievable.

382
00:27:12,653 --> 00:27:15,944
That is a long time ago. - Is that right? Two years.

383
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:20,069
In March. March 17 two years ago.

384
00:27:20,195 --> 00:27:24,320
Are you ... You're not Pierre family?

385
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,527
Anyway. A little. - Weird.

386
00:27:28,653 --> 00:27:33,402
You were just suddenly disappeared. From one day to another.

387
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:39,528
That was just after the school trip ... - Edinburgh.

388
00:27:40,736 --> 00:27:44,610
I remember that I contacted you.

389
00:27:44,736 --> 00:27:47,652
With me? - Yes.

390
00:27:47,778 --> 00:27:50,652
There were so many rumors going around.

391
00:27:50,778 --> 00:27:53,610
Do you still Blasco that math teacher?

392
00:27:53,736 --> 00:28:00,403
She said she had met at a mall in pajama pants.

393
00:28:02,111 --> 00:28:06,860
I pajama pants? Not really. People invent anything.

394
00:28:06,986 --> 00:28:11,153
No I was not. I changed schools.

395
00:28:12,861 --> 00:28:14,528
So I was not.

396
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,778
Julien?

397
00:28:22,111 --> 00:28:23,694
Julian? - Ja.

398
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,986
Can you help with the letter?

399
00:28:27,986 --> 00:28:30,778
Wait for me there. At the door.

400
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,152
He is from Pakistan ...

401
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:39,069
There you are. Are not changed clothes for the photos? Hey.

402
00:28:39,195 --> 00:28:41,778
Hey. Julien Pierre family.

403
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:46,028
What is this mess?

404
00:28:47,403 --> 00:28:49,945
Shoot you, sweetheart?

405
00:29:04,903 --> 00:29:06,361
Julien?

406
00:29:11,986 --> 00:29:14,111
They searched me.

407
00:29:54,945 --> 00:29:56,528
Two minutes.

408
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:04,195
We need to talk.

409
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:15,278
You can not be serious.

410
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:18,486
Is you then really nothing on?

411
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:21,903
It's dead simple.

412
00:30:24,403 --> 00:30:25,820
Is there one?

413
00:30:32,153 --> 00:30:35,944
Is not it better between them with the same space?

414
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:39,444
You see? Do the same spacing to. Very simple.

415
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:42,319
What did I say? You have nothing to say.

416
00:30:42,445 --> 00:30:46,445
That was a trick question. "Is anything on you?" Sure.

417
00:30:58,903 --> 00:31:01,152
Well done. Perfect balance.

418
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:04,360
I had to warm up my voice. Hey.

419
00:31:04,486 --> 00:31:08,527
Yes hello. Is that Italian? Oh yeah?

420
00:31:08,653 --> 00:31:12,069
You just said something. I speak fluent Italian.

421
00:31:12,195 --> 00:31:14,819
They are different dialects.

422
00:31:14,945 --> 00:31:17,985
From southern Abruzzo. The mountains.

423
00:31:18,111 --> 00:31:19,652
It was not Italian.

424
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:25,110
I am here not happy at all. And I do not see any big screen.

425
00:31:25,236 --> 00:31:30,027
Where is it? - Good point. The big screen.

426
00:31:30,153 --> 00:31:33,735
No. That's right, because that is not there.

427
00:31:33,861 --> 00:31:39,444
I had chosen the Fab Live Band DJ Plus Four, including screen.

428
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:43,652
That is an option. We also have James Band Live DJ Plus Four.

429
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:45,652
That's another option.

430
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:48,070
So it's my fault? - No, it is not.

431
00:31:48,361 --> 00:31:52,903
One open parenthesis: It is understated, chic and elegant.

432
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,777
And pleasant. I know.

433
00:31:54,903 --> 00:31:59,195
I had closed the parentheses? - I'm on the music, not the brackets.

434
00:32:00,611 --> 00:32:04,027
I want to emphasize that it is my wedding.

435
00:32:04,153 --> 00:32:07,360
So no silly games. No musical chairs.

436
00:32:07,486 --> 00:32:12,194
And especially no napkins in the air. - That's not our style.

437
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,944
Perfect. Oh yes, I saw it on the table.

438
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:19,735
How to find my flyers? - Well. Get them away.

439
00:32:19,861 --> 00:32:24,236
It's rather me, me, me. That is inappropriate.

440
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,527
I contact? Is it clear? - Crystal clear.

441
00:32:29,653 --> 00:32:33,235
Good. You control the screen? And away with that crap.

442
00:32:33,361 --> 00:32:36,611
It's not a mess, though. - Yes. Thanks.

443
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:41,968
17:54 pm

444
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:48,778
What are you doing, Patrice? - I'm working with torches.

445
00:32:53,361 --> 00:32:55,444
We are so far. - Okay, Bernard.

446
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:58,860
Put the warmers ready. All right, Nabil?

447
00:32:58,986 --> 00:33:02,361
Driving with the warmers.

448
00:33:04,528 --> 00:33:07,611
Roshan, it is to do there.

449
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,861
The warmers are put down.

450
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:17,569
What are you now to figure?

451
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:21,360
You are right on the doorstep. Always the same with you.

452
00:33:21,486 --> 00:33:24,485
Calm down. I'm still looking for a place.

453
00:33:24,611 --> 00:33:27,610
Can not you see that you have in the way.

454
00:33:27,736 --> 00:33:29,695
Get out.

455
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:35,486
Come on.

456
00:33:39,861 --> 00:33:44,402
It's not what it seems. She is nervous of me.

457
00:33:44,528 --> 00:33:49,944
Things usually do what they seem. That's my motto.

458
00:33:53,361 --> 00:33:55,194
What you just heard?

459
00:33:55,486 --> 00:33:59,527
"You see that you have in the way. Get out.

460
00:33:59,653 --> 00:34:06,486
With those stupid e-cigarette you. Domme photographer, think for a moment. "

461
00:34:08,111 --> 00:34:09,902
They do not all said.

462
00:34:10,028 --> 00:34:13,485
I paraphrased her.

463
00:34:13,611 --> 00:34:18,068
I said it intuitively, as it came to mind.

464
00:34:18,194 --> 00:34:21,735
But it came down to. - Approximately, yes.

465
00:34:21,861 --> 00:34:26,193
Good. I take this. You take the rest.

466
00:34:26,319 --> 00:34:29,195
Bernard, you can put the shells cool.

467
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:34,027
What happens now? Frankie?

468
00:34:34,153 --> 00:34:35,569
What is this?

469
00:34:35,695 --> 00:34:39,360
That is by the band. - No, that's because the band.

470
00:34:39,486 --> 00:34:44,610
Gonna go back to the meter, Patrice. - No. You stay here, Patrice.

471
00:34:44,736 --> 00:34:48,777
We need someone for everything ...

472
00:34:48,903 --> 00:34:51,236
I'll go, Josiane.

473
00:34:52,653 --> 00:34:56,111
Plugs are blown. - Thank you, Nabil.

474
00:35:05,861 --> 00:35:09,694
We must find a way to prevent blackouts.

475
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:14,485
If we turn the hotplates, I'll give you a call to the dance floor.

476
00:35:14,611 --> 00:35:19,402
Super. Puik plan. So we can coordinate together.

477
00:35:19,528 --> 00:35:21,402
That's the idea.

478
00:35:21,528 --> 00:35:26,069
But the other way. I give the call and send them to their tables.

479
00:35:26,195 --> 00:35:30,027
I have a sequence in my show. I'm not just some.

480
00:35:30,153 --> 00:35:33,485
Know that we have a protocol in the kitchen.

481
00:35:33,611 --> 00:35:36,694
We turn no pictures. When it's done, we need it.

482
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,527
And you should know, with your limited brain ...

483
00:35:39,653 --> 00:35:42,527
the entertainment is like science.

484
00:35:42,653 --> 00:35:47,694
So you think entertainment is a science? It's hot air.

485
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,319
You sound like an astrophysicist.

486
00:35:50,445 --> 00:35:53,110
You do not save lives of people to dance.

487
00:35:53,236 --> 00:35:56,277
I can not just break a set.

488
00:35:56,403 --> 00:35:58,569
What can care your set.

489
00:35:58,695 --> 00:36:03,902
If we turn the hotplates, you play a ballad and send them to their table.

490
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:05,445
That is not possible.

491
00:36:08,945 --> 00:36:12,570
What did everyone do? - James?

492
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,777
Etienne. - And?

493
00:36:17,903 --> 00:36:22,235
There's a woman for you. - It can also still on.

494
00:36:22,361 --> 00:36:27,320
Prefer not to call me Etienne in public. It's James.

495
00:36:28,528 --> 00:36:30,361
Hello Miss. - Hey.

496
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,111
Are you DJ Fab? - More or less.

497
00:36:33,361 --> 00:36:36,902
I'm his mother. - Crazy. What can I do for you?

498
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,277
My son has given you my list of songs?

499
00:36:40,403 --> 00:36:43,902
Not yet, but we have everything under control.

500
00:36:44,028 --> 00:36:46,361
I forgot Patachou.

501
00:36:47,653 --> 00:36:50,360
Patachou? - Ja.

502
00:36:50,486 --> 00:36:52,528
Let's see here.

503
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,860
Léo Ferré I know.

504
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:03,402
That's for later, when the atmosphere is inside.

505
00:37:03,528 --> 00:37:07,527
Start with Jean Sablon and Felix Mayol.

506
00:37:07,653 --> 00:37:11,361
You know Felix Mayol anyway? - Him just say no.

507
00:37:11,861 --> 00:37:15,485
But we have an archive of pre-war songs.

508
00:37:15,611 --> 00:37:18,402
Let's find that song and play.

509
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:21,653
That's why I brought a tape for you.

510
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,902
Do you have auto-reverse?

511
00:37:27,028 --> 00:37:30,194
we reverse the car with us? - Yes.

512
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,527
Obviously. - I count on you.

513
00:37:32,653 --> 00:37:36,820
Thank you very much, DJ Fab. - James ...

514
00:37:39,153 --> 00:37:40,986
Punk is not dead.

515
00:37:47,111 --> 00:37:49,611
That's for cocktails. Above.

516
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:59,152
Go once to the side.

517
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:01,152
Not bad.

518
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:04,444
Samy was, huh? Samy? - Yes?

519
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:07,861
Go fetch some whistling. - Whistles?

520
00:38:12,445 --> 00:38:14,445
What the hell.

521
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,736
The guy is totally disturbed.

522
00:38:20,903 --> 00:38:23,945
What is he doing? - Does it after a bird?

523
00:38:33,653 --> 00:38:37,402
What are you doing? - I'll get the whistle.

524
00:38:37,528 --> 00:38:38,945
Are you coming?

525
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:46,735
What cop me now with Patrice? You enjoy your freedom, huh?

526
00:38:46,861 --> 00:38:49,319
Are you having fun? - Yes thank you.

527
00:38:49,445 --> 00:38:52,027
Would you punish me sometimes?

528
00:38:52,153 --> 00:38:53,777
Very nice.

529
00:38:53,903 --> 00:38:57,485
No, no one in the garden. There there is an old crone.

530
00:38:57,611 --> 00:38:59,027
That's my mother.

531
00:38:59,153 --> 00:39:02,485
On the side, Mama. - Yes, on the side, Mama.

532
00:39:02,611 --> 00:39:04,569
Here we go again.

533
00:39:04,695 --> 00:39:06,944
Yes. Bravo, very nice.

534
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,860
Super. That is...

535
00:39:08,986 --> 00:39:11,235
No, I'd rather not.

536
00:39:11,361 --> 00:39:13,610
I'm his mother. - Very well.

537
00:39:13,736 --> 00:39:16,735
You're his mother, I'm the photographer.

538
00:39:16,861 --> 00:39:22,028
You get all photos, big and small. Maybe even as fridge magnets.

539
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,986
I asked friendly.

540
00:39:47,945 --> 00:39:51,027
Give it to me. - No do not do that.

541
00:39:51,153 --> 00:39:54,027
He smells like cotton candy. - Stop.

542
00:39:54,153 --> 00:39:58,402
Previously the staff at the guests ate. That was good use.

543
00:39:58,528 --> 00:40:02,485
I can not stand that people with their cell phones.

544
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:05,194
I fancy they do not bother to work?

545
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:10,194
What were you doing before you came to France? Did you work?

546
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,360
Yes, I'm a musician. In an orchestra in Sri Lanka.

547
00:40:13,486 --> 00:40:16,277
With all dishwashers. In an orchestra.

548
00:40:16,403 --> 00:40:18,652
But to me it does not matter ...

549
00:40:18,778 --> 00:40:22,277
What is this? - Your meal.

550
00:40:22,403 --> 00:40:24,610
Where is Adele? - No idea.

551
00:40:24,736 --> 00:40:28,235
Do not eat. She starts to get on my nerves.

552
00:40:28,361 --> 00:40:34,152
I really hate people who take pictures with their mobile phones.

553
00:40:34,278 --> 00:40:38,278
You know, Bastien? - That's a lot of people.

554
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,944
I do not care. I do not care.

555
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:48,860
Did you know that the French Academy wants to abolish the circumflex?

556
00:40:48,986 --> 00:40:52,027
I wish all Jérômes much strength. -Sure.

557
00:40:52,153 --> 00:40:54,486
There is a screw loose with him.

558
00:41:08,653 --> 00:41:10,611
Have you eaten? -Yes.

559
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,069
This is the voice mail from: Nicole.

560
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:43,277
Yes, Nicole. According to me you have not receive my previous posts.

561
00:41:43,403 --> 00:41:46,903
There was apparently a problem.

562
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,444
Oh yes, why not take on?

563
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:54,069
According to me you can see my number and not take on.

564
00:41:54,195 --> 00:41:57,902
I would almost my number blocking, if I knew how.

565
00:41:58,028 --> 00:42:00,860
I need you speak. Yes, Roshan?

566
00:42:00,986 --> 00:42:06,110
I just wanted to say ... I know that ... -Say it though, because I ...

567
00:42:06,236 --> 00:42:07,903
Congratulations.

568
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:14,235
It is not until tomorrow. What do you want? -I am moving Tuesday.

569
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:18,653
May I borrow the truck? -The truck? Yes, though.

570
00:42:19,445 --> 00:42:23,777
Your message could not be included. Message is deleted.

571
00:42:23,903 --> 00:42:27,110
Was there anything? -You are still young.

572
00:42:27,236 --> 00:42:32,444
How old are you? 40? 45? -Yeah, right. Say it now but.

573
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:37,735
May I Tuesday for my move? -Tuesday? Of course.

574
00:42:37,861 --> 00:42:41,360
For my move. -Yes, I'm through.

575
00:42:41,486 --> 00:42:45,194
Dont like it once. Well done.

576
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:50,235
You know the best. It is black on white. We eat the same as the guests.

577
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:53,860
But you have not finished elementary school.

578
00:42:53,986 --> 00:42:56,278
Enough. Come, Adèle.

579
00:42:58,445 --> 00:43:03,360
They eat the same as the guests. This is stated in their contract.

580
00:43:03,486 --> 00:43:07,985
I thought they ...-No. And is not that on his neck.

581
00:43:08,111 --> 00:43:11,111
It is enough like that. Adèle?

582
00:43:14,861 --> 00:43:16,403
All right.

583
00:43:22,861 --> 00:43:25,111
And think of the drinks.

584
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:31,500
19:00 hours

585
00:43:32,445 --> 00:43:37,444
I repeat once more: this is a 17th century castle.

586
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:40,319
So the electricity is limited.

587
00:43:40,445 --> 00:43:44,903
They knew then still no light bridges and sound systems.

588
00:43:46,945 --> 00:43:52,194
So we use not all power at the same time. We exchange.

589
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:58,402
We coordinate, we consult, we share. So not all short-circuit.

590
00:43:58,528 --> 00:44:03,110
And I would like it if we avoid tensions.

591
00:44:03,236 --> 00:44:05,819
Stay calm.

592
00:44:05,945 --> 00:44:12,277
As I always say, you guys are behavior and courtesy us shield.

593
00:44:12,403 --> 00:44:15,277
There are 200 guests, who judge us.

594
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:20,985
This important customer trust us are complete wedding.

595
00:44:21,111 --> 00:44:23,777
We will deliver.

596
00:44:23,903 --> 00:44:29,527
I trust that we correct this evening a beautiful evening.

597
00:44:29,653 --> 00:44:31,445
Questions?

598
00:44:33,903 --> 00:44:36,610
Go ahead, Henri. -No, no ...

599
00:44:36,736 --> 00:44:38,569
This is the right time.

600
00:44:38,695 --> 00:44:40,361
I listen, Henri.

601
00:44:42,361 --> 00:44:44,236
Say what you want to say.

602
00:44:45,653 --> 00:44:47,985
Good question. Even more?

603
00:44:48,111 --> 00:44:52,110
We need these costumes really up to? -We want to know.

604
00:44:52,236 --> 00:44:55,569
Especially the wigs are ridiculous.

605
00:44:55,695 --> 00:44:59,735
They are unhygienic. -They itch really huge.

606
00:44:59,861 --> 00:45:02,652
We can not all evening wear.

607
00:45:02,778 --> 00:45:08,527
That was clear: at the livery has a wig, at least until the dessert.

608
00:45:08,653 --> 00:45:11,277
You get a bonus of 47 euro.

609
00:45:11,403 --> 00:45:14,527
It's not about that bonus, they just stink.

610
00:45:14,653 --> 00:45:18,444
It is difficult in these ridiculous clothes.

611
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:21,277
They are very hot, we sweat as otters.

612
00:45:21,403 --> 00:45:25,735
Exactly my point. -The last time was bad enough.

613
00:45:25,861 --> 00:45:28,235
I put a wig on for 47 euro.

614
00:45:28,361 --> 00:45:34,610
How can I articulate it so that it is completely clear for you?

615
00:45:34,736 --> 00:45:39,236
If you don't want to wear costume: no problem.

616
00:45:40,486 --> 00:45:42,152
No.

617
00:45:42,278 --> 00:45:46,278
You go to the dressing room, grabs your stuff and disappears.

618
00:45:49,986 --> 00:45:55,069
For the rest: reception of the guests about five minutes. Wig on the head.

619
00:45:55,195 --> 00:45:56,986
Moving forward with the goat.

620
00:46:14,861 --> 00:46:17,777
Ah, Henri. That wig is great.

621
00:46:17,903 --> 00:46:20,653
It was quite a good idea. - See?

622
00:46:25,611 --> 00:46:27,111
All of them.

623
00:46:46,278 --> 00:46:49,153
To refill. - Yes, of course.

624
00:46:52,403 --> 00:46:55,610
I shake the cards and keep them in a range.

625
00:46:55,736 --> 00:46:58,777
What's your name, young man? - Benjamin.

626
00:46:58,903 --> 00:47:01,986
Take just one card. - No me.

627
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:06,486
Let him something about my guests?

628
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:13,027
Lovely.

629
00:47:13,153 --> 00:47:15,903
I hope you have smashed a lot.

630
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,610
I need you for something. - Oh yeah.

631
00:47:21,736 --> 00:47:25,110
I will take care of it. - Love.

632
00:47:25,236 --> 00:47:27,152
Was that good? - Perfect.

633
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:30,528
But I still have no excuse. - It'll come.

634
00:47:31,445 --> 00:47:34,319
Just ask how it is with the foie gras.

635
00:47:34,445 --> 00:47:39,610
Guy, you've got nothing better to do than the buffet leegschransen?

636
00:47:39,736 --> 00:47:43,110
I've barely touched. - Go to work.

637
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:45,444
I can never do a photo shoot.

638
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:50,277
And so you eat all the snacks but? - Just one.

639
00:47:50,403 --> 00:47:53,194
Act now and get to work.

640
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,735
And pull a jacket, something tone perch.

641
00:47:56,861 --> 00:48:02,027
The foie gras is not fried. - I told you nothing.

642
00:48:02,153 --> 00:48:04,527
He is half done. - I asked nothing.

643
00:48:04,653 --> 00:48:07,403
Unbelievable. Zeal ...

644
00:48:07,611 --> 00:48:11,819
You just asked me. - Of course. What is the foie gras prepared?

645
00:48:11,945 --> 00:48:14,945
Smoked chicken. - delicious. Come with.

646
00:48:57,486 --> 00:49:00,819
Keep my tray, I think I should go to the kitchen.

647
00:49:00,945 --> 00:49:03,445
Oh, excuse me.

648
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:08,402
An appetizer? - Love.

649
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:12,902
Choosing tricky, huh? What is that little red?

650
00:49:13,028 --> 00:49:15,528
Take your time, I'll be back.

651
00:49:18,695 --> 00:49:20,820
Pierre. Helena.

652
00:49:35,153 --> 00:49:39,277
You can probably explain this. - An accident.

653
00:49:39,403 --> 00:49:41,985
I bump into him and is his phone.

654
00:49:42,111 --> 00:49:44,986
Just ask the guy. Say it.

655
00:49:46,195 --> 00:49:50,277
I'm going to see what they are doing. I'll be right back.

656
00:49:50,403 --> 00:49:54,694
What am I going to say to the customer? Have you thought about that?

657
00:49:54,820 --> 00:50:01,360
Ask him about the magnets. We need to buy really for ten hours.

658
00:50:01,486 --> 00:50:06,694
Guy, we've known each other a long time, huh?

659
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,319
We are friends. - Of course.

660
00:50:09,445 --> 00:50:13,902
Remember what you said? "You're the only one who hires me?"

661
00:50:14,028 --> 00:50:15,735
Do you remember? - Yes.

662
00:50:15,861 --> 00:50:19,694
See it for you. 'The only.'

663
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:21,902
I can see it.

664
00:50:22,028 --> 00:50:26,070
Herpak yourself. Be polite, explain things.

665
00:50:26,278 --> 00:50:28,985
And take pictures, that's your job.

666
00:50:29,111 --> 00:50:34,152
Let me hear nothing more from you. Please. I beg you.

667
00:50:34,278 --> 00:50:36,444
No problem.

668
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:39,444
And pull the jacket off yet again.

669
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:42,819
It was your idea. - I know. I was wrong.

670
00:50:42,946 --> 00:50:45,894
I had something else in mind. - Good, because he's quite ...

671
00:50:46,021 --> 00:50:48,695
I see. Is he your student? Give back.

672
00:50:56,736 --> 00:50:59,028
No, it tells me nothing.

673
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:05,360
Yes, surely. I've singlet. I will soon turn.

674
00:51:05,486 --> 00:51:08,027
Do you have anything of Gaston Ouvrard?

675
00:51:08,153 --> 00:51:12,235
Yes, which is fantastic. I turn him after Patachou.

676
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:14,569
Come here. - I'm coming.

677
00:51:14,695 --> 00:51:17,819
I forgot something important. The thank you's.

678
00:51:17,945 --> 00:51:19,569
I'm listening. - Beautiful.

679
00:51:19,695 --> 00:51:23,569
For the main course you take on my character and the word says:

680
00:51:23,695 --> 00:51:28,194
"I want to thank someone whose contribution was crucial.

681
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:33,235
Someone had not been possible without whom this evening. " Do you understand?

682
00:51:33,361 --> 00:51:36,361
Improvise, but not too much.

683
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:40,944
Soft light, beautiful music, the guests on the dance floor.

684
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:43,527
And then the napkins appear.

685
00:51:43,653 --> 00:51:45,569
I'm kidding.

686
00:51:45,695 --> 00:51:50,777
Again? Are you listening? You say, "This is all thanks to Pierre."

687
00:51:50,903 --> 00:51:52,569
"Thanks to Pierre." Fine.

688
00:51:52,695 --> 00:51:56,028
Who is Pierre? - That's me.

689
00:52:00,361 --> 00:52:02,236
There he is.

690
00:52:03,861 --> 00:52:07,486
Have Le Chapeau de Zozo? - No, I do not have that.

691
00:52:09,028 --> 00:52:11,152
I am a friend of Pierre.

692
00:52:11,278 --> 00:52:14,652
Do you greet each other? Then we can start.

693
00:52:14,778 --> 00:52:18,653
One two Three. Just perfect. Thank you.

694
00:52:20,195 --> 00:52:23,069
I know what you're gonna say.

695
00:52:23,195 --> 00:52:24,735
You have no idea.

696
00:52:24,861 --> 00:52:29,444
Let me explain. She is a former colleague, a history teacher.

697
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:31,777
What is your definition of work?

698
00:52:31,903 --> 00:52:36,444
I walked her bump when I was working the tables.

699
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:40,110
A shock went through me. I began to shake.

700
00:52:40,236 --> 00:52:45,319
Aside: Did you see her white dress?

701
00:52:45,445 --> 00:52:49,485
If I hear such talk, and I like you really like ...

702
00:52:49,611 --> 00:52:53,902
I wonder why I work so stupid idiot for me.

703
00:52:54,028 --> 00:52:56,485
You can not say. - Excuse me?

704
00:52:56,611 --> 00:53:00,569
'Stupid idiot' is redundant. A pleonasm.

705
00:53:00,695 --> 00:53:03,444
It's like: 'We start at the beginning. "

706
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:05,070
Is that right?

707
00:53:05,278 --> 00:53:09,485
Then we start at the beginning. You have two options:

708
00:53:09,611 --> 00:53:14,902
Whether you're pulling your right to livery, with wig and all, and go to work ...

709
00:53:15,028 --> 00:53:21,485
if you pull your crazy pajamas back on and go the news look in your little house.

710
00:53:21,611 --> 00:53:26,319
Hey, that's a pleonasm. 'Little house.'

711
00:53:26,445 --> 00:53:28,985
Two options. Say it.

712
00:53:29,111 --> 00:53:32,152
Where could I choose from? - I looked for you everywhere.

713
00:53:32,278 --> 00:53:34,361
What is it? - Issues.

714
00:53:34,528 --> 00:53:36,110
What kind? - Great.

715
00:53:36,236 --> 00:53:40,277
Max, I weighed the pros and cons. I'm leaving.

716
00:53:40,403 --> 00:53:42,486
Perfect. That way.

717
00:53:43,986 --> 00:53:47,236
Can you play? Not?

718
00:53:50,403 --> 00:53:53,777
It's a disaster, Max. I know me no more advice.

719
00:53:53,903 --> 00:53:58,569
Look at Titi. So I've never seen him.

720
00:53:58,695 --> 00:54:03,860
Titi, how do you feel exactly? - As if I have a stone in my stomach.

721
00:54:03,986 --> 00:54:07,860
Do you think you will sound like? Musically.

722
00:54:07,986 --> 00:54:12,610
If I lie, I'm fine. But when I get up that stone is there again.

723
00:54:12,736 --> 00:54:15,153
He can not play lying.

724
00:54:16,945 --> 00:54:21,735
No doubt anyone who has eaten lamb is floored.

725
00:54:21,861 --> 00:54:26,110
The food for the staff was excellent. No doubt.

726
00:54:26,236 --> 00:54:30,402
I have a background singer and bassist, who is vegetarian.

727
00:54:30,528 --> 00:54:36,445
I can not only occur with the bass. - They should only miming.

728
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,736
21:18 pm

729
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:45,820
Research indicates that the refrigerator was turned off.

730
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:50,860
The meat is spoiled. - Damn, man.

731
00:54:50,986 --> 00:54:52,402
We hang out.

732
00:54:52,528 --> 00:54:56,444
The plug has probably removed deliberately.

733
00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:59,485
An electric shaver in it.

734
00:54:59,611 --> 00:55:03,445
I do not want to be premature, but it looks like sabotage.

735
00:55:04,528 --> 00:55:10,652
They are floored by the lamb. - The meat is indeed not good.

736
00:55:10,778 --> 00:55:13,110
We need to pay attention.

737
00:55:13,236 --> 00:55:16,819
This has most of food poisoning.

738
00:55:16,945 --> 00:55:19,820
What do we eat it, Max?

739
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:24,735
There you are.

740
00:55:24,861 --> 00:55:27,444
Is everything all right? - Could not be better.

741
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:30,360
Then the guests at the table. - Super.

742
00:55:30,486 --> 00:55:32,403
There we go.

743
00:55:35,695 --> 00:55:40,194
We give them pastries. All defrost. Big guns.

744
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:44,110
We give them pastries and meanwhile think of something.

745
00:55:44,236 --> 00:55:48,861
Quickly, the patties. - Get them forth. The rest can go.

746
00:56:08,361 --> 00:56:11,652
Thank you, Antoine, but I do help me out.

747
00:56:11,778 --> 00:56:15,402
That's how it is. Bye, Antoine.

748
00:56:15,528 --> 00:56:19,360
Hubert Royal Parc help us out of this fix.

749
00:56:19,486 --> 00:56:23,735
Awesome. I drive there. Adele, you got a minute.

750
00:56:23,861 --> 00:56:25,278
Roshan, kom mee.

751
00:56:29,528 --> 00:56:34,777
This I have not seen in 20 years. - I have often heard about it.

752
00:56:34,903 --> 00:56:37,236
I do not get it. Why?

753
00:56:37,403 --> 00:56:40,110
Anchovy-sausages. An old tactic.

754
00:56:40,236 --> 00:56:44,320
When a disaster in the kitchen, it is heavy on the stomach.

755
00:56:44,486 --> 00:56:46,819
The salty anchovy makes thirsty.

756
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:50,152
They drink mineral water and their stomach blows.

757
00:56:50,278 --> 00:56:51,819
Yeah, and so?

758
00:56:51,945 --> 00:56:55,360
They have two hours no longer hungry and so win time.

759
00:56:55,486 --> 00:56:57,695
I'll explain it yet again.

760
00:57:03,278 --> 00:57:04,820
Put salt on.

761
00:57:13,528 --> 00:57:18,277
Here we go. Think of the service, do your best.

762
00:57:18,403 --> 00:57:22,110
And remember: one patty, one glass of mineral water.

763
00:57:22,236 --> 00:57:25,444
The next party. Think of the presentation.

764
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:30,319
No one may see through anything. Let the bridegroom to give his speech.

765
00:57:30,445 --> 00:57:34,402
I have 30 to 45 minutes. - You can count on me.

766
00:57:34,528 --> 00:57:38,152
Adele, you take the lead. Let the sausages.

767
00:57:38,278 --> 00:57:42,277
Put extra salt, but no interruptions.

768
00:57:42,403 --> 00:57:45,277
we set our clocks right? - Nerd.

769
00:57:45,403 --> 00:57:50,694
Why now do this every time? - Because you just spouting nonsense.

770
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:52,944
It's a good idea. - Stop.

771
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:56,569
It's time for a truce. Enough.

772
00:57:56,695 --> 00:57:59,277
Give each other a hand.

773
00:57:59,403 --> 00:58:02,986
Yes certainly. You give each other by hand.

774
00:58:05,153 --> 00:58:08,694
I wait. I have not got all night.

775
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:12,486
fucking give each other a hand. Forward.

776
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:16,485
That you believe it.

777
00:58:16,611 --> 00:58:19,527
Come on. - This is good enough.

778
00:58:19,653 --> 00:58:23,610
Come back. - No.

779
00:58:23,736 --> 00:58:26,778
Come back later they see us.

780
00:58:31,028 --> 00:58:34,736
Give each other such thing. What is it called? A hug.

781
00:58:35,736 --> 00:58:39,444
Yes, we are a team, James. Come on, Adele.

782
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:43,610
If so. That's better. Fine.

783
00:58:43,736 --> 00:58:46,319
This I believe already something more.

784
00:58:46,445 --> 00:58:51,195
That's better. Now you really are a team.

785
00:58:53,028 --> 00:58:57,069
That's much better. I feel respect.

786
00:58:57,195 --> 00:59:00,694
You now really show a lot of respect for each other.

787
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:02,860
It's fine this way.

788
00:59:02,986 --> 00:59:06,111
Are you back so far? Adele?

789
00:59:09,278 --> 00:59:11,778
Enough. Someone?

790
00:59:14,403 --> 00:59:17,235
The patties, you have an emergency.

791
00:59:17,361 --> 00:59:20,861
Let's bury the hatchet. I was wrong.

792
00:59:21,028 --> 00:59:25,569
If you need me ... I know you're not driving anymore.

793
00:59:25,695 --> 00:59:31,944
That's very kind, but not necessary. And you're already half in bed. I'll be fine.

794
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:34,652
Is he upset?

795
00:59:34,778 --> 00:59:38,027
Roshan? Can you drive? - No.

796
00:59:38,153 --> 00:59:41,570
Have you reconciled? - Yes thank you.

797
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:50,028
You are wrong. I was not in bed. This is an intermediate pants.

798
00:59:51,195 --> 00:59:54,945
What are you doing? - Nothing.

799
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:14,027
Is everything alright? - Know your Roshan?

800
01:00:14,153 --> 01:00:16,485
Julien, my brother. He works with me.

801
01:00:16,611 --> 01:00:21,527
You really save me from the emergency, Hubert. - You'd have done the same.

802
01:00:21,653 --> 01:00:26,360
I have prepared everything I had, and some pastries.

803
01:00:26,486 --> 01:00:28,735
The latter is not required.

804
01:00:28,861 --> 01:00:31,819
Do not worry. Everything is in the refrigerator.

805
01:00:31,945 --> 01:00:35,652
Get what we put aside Siva. This way.

806
01:00:35,778 --> 01:00:38,403
It's really a mess tonight.

807
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:41,902
I always have an excuse.

808
01:00:42,028 --> 01:00:44,360
Such excuse I could never imagine.

809
01:00:44,486 --> 01:00:47,153
Your language sounds very musical.

810
01:00:49,028 --> 01:00:53,069
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?

811
01:00:53,195 --> 01:00:56,569
I wish a very special someone calling me.

812
01:00:56,695 --> 01:00:59,360
An exceptional person, and unique.

813
01:00:59,486 --> 01:01:03,694
A generous person and very pleasant.

814
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:06,652
Without him we would not be here tonight.

815
01:01:06,778 --> 01:01:10,444
He has prepared this magnificent evening minutely.

816
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:15,944
Friendly, attentive and discreet. Allow all up.

817
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:19,528
Give him a thunderous applause Pierre.

818
01:01:25,361 --> 01:01:27,236
yet Hold on.

819
01:01:29,695 --> 01:01:32,820
Come on, Pierrot. - Hold on now.

820
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:38,985
Come on stage, we are waiting. Encourage him briefly.

821
01:01:39,111 --> 01:01:42,277
I will do, I will not?

822
01:01:42,403 --> 01:01:45,694
just try not to get out.

823
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:47,361
What a jerk, man.

824
01:01:48,903 --> 01:01:50,986
Patty? - No not now.

825
01:01:53,403 --> 01:01:56,610
Otherwise the napkins, though.

826
01:01:56,736 --> 01:01:58,403
Come on, Pierre.

827
01:01:59,903 --> 01:02:02,110
We have a full program.

828
01:02:02,236 --> 01:02:06,985
He does it. Give him a round of applause. Pierrot.

829
01:02:07,111 --> 01:02:10,235
Come on stage.

830
01:02:10,361 --> 01:02:14,402
Once more a big applause for Pierrot.

831
01:02:14,528 --> 01:02:18,361
I do not want you ever call me Pierrot.

832
01:02:21,361 --> 01:02:25,694
Very kind. Thank you.

833
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:31,360
Thank you. This I did not expect. Sit down.

834
01:02:31,486 --> 01:02:38,694
I'm not a great speaker, but I would like to address a few words to you.

835
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:43,320
Pierre has always liked talking. Even as a boy.

836
01:02:44,028 --> 01:02:50,694
Héléna and I have agreed that I would speak on behalf of both of us.

837
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:54,069
Is not that right, honey? I love you.

838
01:02:54,195 --> 01:02:55,944
So it's up to me ...

839
01:02:56,070 --> 01:03:01,485
I do not remember who said it, but I heard you wanted to stop.

840
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:04,360
That I consider it. - For real?

841
01:03:04,486 --> 01:03:09,319
Not me. Retired: I'm getting depressed just thinking about it.

842
01:03:09,445 --> 01:03:13,194
Will you miss it? - I do not think so.

843
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,194
If I can take a couple of guys ...

844
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:21,527
Yes, maybe. But tonight I'm crazy about them.

845
01:03:21,653 --> 01:03:25,944
There was a revolt because they did not want a costume.

846
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:29,027
A lot of fuss over a wig.

847
01:03:29,153 --> 01:03:34,610
The customer wanted everyone was dressed as a lackey, so I get it.

848
01:03:34,736 --> 01:03:36,527
Everybody? - Yes.

849
01:03:36,653 --> 01:03:38,319
Come with me.

850
01:03:38,445 --> 01:03:39,903
Grab one.

851
01:03:42,236 --> 01:03:45,819
For me all the staff dressed.

852
01:03:45,945 --> 01:03:47,486
But all the guests.

853
01:03:48,486 --> 01:03:50,236
Mazel Tov.

854
01:03:53,111 --> 01:03:56,736
All go to Kevin for his bar mitzvah.

855
01:03:58,153 --> 01:04:00,070
What a sight, eh?

856
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,777
Apache rabbi is perfect.

857
01:04:09,903 --> 01:04:15,360
I'll see you post, Siva. And then I give him or to Roshan, right?

858
01:04:15,486 --> 01:04:18,069
He is very friendly, a former teacher.

859
01:04:18,195 --> 01:04:22,778
He can help you with your post, but the poor man is depressed.

860
01:04:23,403 --> 01:04:27,569
you say something bad about me? - I said you're a good teacher.

861
01:04:27,695 --> 01:04:29,403
That's good to hear.

862
01:04:29,611 --> 01:04:33,360
Hence the pajama pants? - He calls it an intermediate pants.

863
01:04:33,486 --> 01:04:37,652
That was about me. I do not speak Tamil, but I heard 'pajamas.

864
01:04:37,778 --> 01:04:41,402
If I forgot someone ...

865
01:04:41,528 --> 01:04:45,735
know that there is no hierarchy or rank.

866
01:04:45,861 --> 01:04:49,235
Tonight I'm somewhat overwhelmed by emotions.

867
01:04:49,361 --> 01:04:56,110
And who knows me well, knows that I love hard feelings under control.

868
01:04:56,236 --> 01:05:01,236
I would have liked to say, and why not, I love you.

869
01:05:04,695 --> 01:05:09,653
Anyway, I appreciate you all equally.

870
01:05:15,028 --> 01:05:17,111
What an evening, friends.

871
01:05:17,653 --> 01:05:20,944
Have you heard anything from your sister? Did not she ...

872
01:05:21,070 --> 01:05:23,694
Has she said anything?

873
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:25,277
About what?

874
01:05:25,403 --> 01:05:30,570
I left her, but she does not call back. Not for her.

875
01:05:35,695 --> 01:05:41,235
Make use of this break, to get a little breath ...

876
01:05:41,361 --> 01:05:44,319
Look around, meet new people.

877
01:05:44,445 --> 01:05:46,236
Why do you say that?

878
01:05:47,653 --> 01:05:50,485
I do not know.

879
01:05:50,611 --> 01:05:53,819
I do not understand why you are together.

880
01:05:53,945 --> 01:05:56,235
I do not know what you cling to.

881
01:05:56,361 --> 01:06:00,861
We are together, we are a couple. I'll hold onto.

882
01:06:01,028 --> 01:06:05,527
Oh yeah. You are a couple.

883
01:06:05,653 --> 01:06:10,820
That's very strong. These are arguments that I can not compete.

884
01:06:13,153 --> 01:06:15,527
I'll tell you something. - Do not.

885
01:06:15,653 --> 01:06:18,361
Your marriage has expired.

886
01:06:20,903 --> 01:06:22,860
You bored rot.

887
01:06:22,986 --> 01:06:29,110
Your relationship is a bit ... sad. I can not find the right word.

888
01:06:29,236 --> 01:06:33,653
I know what you want to say, Julien. You know me.

889
01:06:35,028 --> 01:06:38,194
Death, that word I was looking for. - Watch the road.

890
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:41,486
I was looking for. Your relationship is dead.

891
01:06:45,528 --> 01:06:50,902
Here I really clever on. Nice to talk to you here.

892
01:06:51,028 --> 01:06:55,653
You're welcome. It does me good. - As it goes to.

893
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:00,194
you do it well, Roshan? - Yes.

894
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:04,153
That hat looks good on you. - Stetson.

895
01:07:05,528 --> 01:07:09,778
I also want to thank everyone who has come from far away.

896
01:07:09,945 --> 01:07:13,194
Uit Compiegne, Marton, Fontainebleau ...

897
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:17,860
Porchefontaine, Bois Lieu, Goualières, my cousin in Buc ...

898
01:07:17,986 --> 01:07:21,028
And those who could not come ...

899
01:07:39,486 --> 01:07:42,945
They cram them in. I get even more.

900
01:07:47,778 --> 01:07:50,235
What are you doing here alone? I was looking for you.

901
01:07:50,361 --> 01:07:54,985
I could not hear him. he began in what year?

902
01:07:55,111 --> 01:07:59,943
I see the kids just grow. - He is terrible.

903
01:08:00,069 --> 01:08:03,360
I got a text message that they are coming. - Yes, me too.

904
01:08:03,486 --> 01:08:06,193
Let's do it like this.

905
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:11,152
I let them dance. And your sign I make them sit down.

906
01:08:11,278 --> 01:08:14,527
"Ladies and gentlemen, the food is ready." It'll be fine.

907
01:08:14,653 --> 01:08:17,736
Do not bother. - It's no trouble.

908
01:08:18,819 --> 01:08:23,402
If we are late and you're halfway through your set, make it calm down.

909
01:08:23,528 --> 01:08:27,027
We do adapt, just as it does not come.

910
01:08:27,153 --> 01:08:31,027
You decide. You have priority.

911
01:08:31,153 --> 01:08:35,735
I know how it works in the kitchen. So give it to.

912
01:08:35,861 --> 01:08:39,235
That's really not necessary. It is thoughtful.

913
01:08:39,361 --> 01:08:41,693
I want to be attentive.

914
01:08:41,819 --> 01:08:45,193
No, you first. - No, you first.

915
01:08:45,319 --> 01:08:49,568
No, you. - You.

916
01:08:49,694 --> 01:08:52,152
The I do not give shit.

917
01:08:52,278 --> 01:08:54,861
May I quote Racine?

918
01:08:56,736 --> 01:08:59,402
"Burrus knew it was not true.

919
01:08:59,528 --> 01:09:02,610
Sagacious virtue came to him very useful. "

920
01:09:02,736 --> 01:09:08,985
There is always a moment when I'm bored me terribly. That's now.

921
01:09:09,111 --> 01:09:11,819
Then I have something that always works.

922
01:09:14,736 --> 01:09:17,486
Do not you know what it is? - No.

923
01:09:18,944 --> 01:09:21,110
Ask anyway.

924
01:09:21,236 --> 01:09:24,319
What is it? - You want to know everything, huh?

925
01:09:24,445 --> 01:09:28,444
I look at a woman and ask questions about her myself.

926
01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:32,360
Is she ... Is she married?

927
01:09:32,486 --> 01:09:34,319
Is she happy?

928
01:09:34,445 --> 01:09:38,194
She wants me to her foothold? Things you do not know.

929
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:41,735
There is a way. - What?

930
01:09:41,861 --> 01:09:44,902
You can find someone who is registered.

931
01:09:45,028 --> 01:09:50,152
Who is married, who is single. - What do you know now?

932
01:09:50,278 --> 01:09:55,570
Very much. There is an app that links dating sites to geolocation.

933
01:09:56,653 --> 01:09:59,028
You know what geolocation? - Yes.

934
01:10:00,445 --> 01:10:03,860
But tell only once. What is an app?

935
01:10:03,986 --> 01:10:07,610
An application. - Right, yes.

936
01:10:07,736 --> 01:10:14,402
With GPS you know in real time whether a woman is interested and if she is nearby.

937
01:10:14,528 --> 01:10:16,653
In this room, for example.

938
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:23,777
How do you know she's here? - That's geolocation.

939
01:10:23,903 --> 01:10:25,819
Really exists? - Of course.

940
01:10:25,945 --> 01:10:28,403
The app calculates your distance.

941
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:32,860
If you like their profile, you can send her a heart.

942
01:10:32,986 --> 01:10:38,361
And then you can chat, things do go.

943
01:10:38,611 --> 01:10:43,194
To do things? I want that. Do you hear me? I want that.

944
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:47,110
Why did I not app? - Give your phone once.

945
01:10:47,236 --> 01:10:50,945
Beware, this is the newest iPhone. - Not really.

946
01:10:53,861 --> 01:10:55,735
Send him some hearts.

947
01:10:55,861 --> 01:11:01,528
You must first create a profile. - That will come later. First the hearts.

948
01:11:12,445 --> 01:11:16,527
I'm going to just change clothes. - Good plan.

949
01:11:16,653 --> 01:11:19,569
And? - Everything under control.

950
01:11:19,695 --> 01:11:24,860
Good news, bad news. - The sausages were a success.

951
01:11:24,986 --> 01:11:27,777
The groom she mellow rumored.

952
01:11:27,903 --> 01:11:32,235
Max, it is however small portions. - then halve them.

953
01:11:32,361 --> 01:11:37,610
Or in threes. Extra sauce and vegetables. What should we do? Exactly.

954
01:11:37,736 --> 01:11:41,485
And the bad news? - An old man is stitched into a patty.

955
01:11:41,611 --> 01:11:43,861
Death. He's in the freezer.

956
01:11:46,403 --> 01:11:50,152
That face ... - Stop it, Adele. No kidding now.

957
01:11:50,278 --> 01:11:53,235
Josiane and Patrice mercy on him.

958
01:11:53,361 --> 01:11:57,653
Again the face, but I mean it. - I pulled a face.

959
01:11:59,695 --> 01:12:03,111
I talk to here with the groom.

960
01:12:05,611 --> 01:12:08,110
I would like to conclude this speech ...

961
01:12:08,236 --> 01:12:12,777
In the words of Pierre Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais ...

962
01:12:12,903 --> 01:12:16,736
in 1775, or thereabouts ...

963
01:12:16,945 --> 01:12:20,485
these lines wrote in The Barber of Seville:

964
01:12:20,611 --> 01:12:27,320
"I hasten to laugh sorry to cry all fear for it."

965
01:12:28,028 --> 01:12:31,944
So, friends, let go the party.

966
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:34,278
Thank you.

967
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:48,735
That was beautiful. - Yes?

968
01:12:48,861 --> 01:12:54,027
Thanks, but no pies anymore. - They're on the house.

969
01:12:54,153 --> 01:12:58,027
What remains now the main course? - It is now really.

970
01:12:58,153 --> 01:13:03,653
We did not want to interrupt your strong speech.

971
01:13:04,653 --> 01:13:09,402
Was not it too long? - No, it flew by.

972
01:13:09,528 --> 01:13:10,986
What did you like best?

973
01:13:12,361 --> 01:13:15,194
That's hard to say, but the end ...

974
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,819
Beaumarchais? - Very good.

975
01:13:17,945 --> 01:13:20,444
"I almost do not cry for me ..."

976
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:23,902
There is Corinne. - I sell him a blow.

977
01:13:24,028 --> 01:13:29,277
I forgot to say. That guy came within half an hour ago.

978
01:13:29,403 --> 01:13:33,235
He just observing, taking photos and asked for you.

979
01:13:33,361 --> 01:13:36,819
How often do you have me fooled?

980
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:40,195
I mean, it's no joke. It's him.

981
01:13:41,903 --> 01:13:45,485
Who is that? - No idea, but it's weird.

982
01:13:45,611 --> 01:13:47,403
Why the attache case?

983
01:13:49,486 --> 01:13:50,903
Shit. - Wat?

984
01:13:51,111 --> 01:13:56,235
A match. She just responded. 30 meters away.

985
01:13:56,361 --> 01:14:00,778
How does she look like? Do you have a photo? - The profile is hidden.

986
01:14:01,986 --> 01:14:03,402
Send a heart.

987
01:14:03,528 --> 01:14:06,861
A hidden section is not usually a good sign.

988
01:14:07,945 --> 01:14:09,444
Do it anyway.

989
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:12,694
Henri, Max tell what you just told me.

990
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:16,860
Nor is it again so ... - Come on.

991
01:14:16,986 --> 01:14:18,861
For the thread with it.

992
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:23,069
Sabbatini, the Italian caterer. A friend works for him.

993
01:14:23,195 --> 01:14:27,110
He suddenly had the health inspection visit.

994
01:14:27,236 --> 01:14:32,485
He was fined, I believe something of 40,000 euros.

995
01:14:32,611 --> 01:14:35,110
He paid a lot of people in the black.

996
01:14:35,236 --> 01:14:40,027
Rumor has it that they invade currently unannounced.

997
01:14:40,153 --> 01:14:42,153
They often look.

998
01:14:51,945 --> 01:14:53,653
Water. - Space.

999
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:56,610
Put him in the reanimeerpositie.

1000
01:14:56,736 --> 01:15:00,611
Give him sugar. - You should not have brought it up.

1001
01:15:03,778 --> 01:15:07,070
Is everything alright? Is that better?

1002
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:12,110
Do it now with me on.

1003
01:15:12,236 --> 01:15:15,027
You're on an empty stomach entered the evening.

1004
01:15:15,153 --> 01:15:19,277
And the stress can be fatal. - Especially at your age.

1005
01:15:19,403 --> 01:15:23,070
You were just as unwell. We should not exaggerate.

1006
01:15:24,278 --> 01:15:28,402
Another one? - No, those things are salty, say.

1007
01:15:28,528 --> 01:15:32,652
Why all the stress? Maybe it's just a late guest.

1008
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:36,652
A guest? At a wedding with a briefcase?

1009
01:15:36,778 --> 01:15:40,277
The briefcase can be seen as a proof ...

1010
01:15:40,403 --> 01:15:43,653
Yes, exactly. Josiane?

1011
01:15:47,111 --> 01:15:50,110
Who will be kept off the books?

1012
01:15:50,236 --> 01:15:54,527
We, our story is not in the books. - Shut your mouth, man.

1013
01:15:54,653 --> 01:15:57,444
Three or four, maximum.

1014
01:15:57,570 --> 01:16:00,111
Who is not on the payroll tonight?

1015
01:16:02,153 --> 01:16:06,194
Stick your hand not so high. Up here is enough.

1016
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:11,110
Yet so much? Draw a jacket and mingle with the guests.

1017
01:16:11,236 --> 01:16:13,902
But discreet.

1018
01:16:14,028 --> 01:16:15,985
Go, ahead.

1019
01:16:16,111 --> 01:16:18,694
Will I then just change?

1020
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:22,153
I think you did not feel well.

1021
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,195
That could well be.

1022
01:17:15,945 --> 01:17:19,152
Day, children. - Hey.

1023
01:17:19,278 --> 01:17:21,277
Patty? - No thanks.

1024
01:17:21,403 --> 01:17:24,111
They are also very salty. - I know.

1025
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:42,819
I was looking for you. I would like a picture of each table with me there.

1026
01:17:42,945 --> 01:17:46,277
Obviously, we will be able to do it here.

1027
01:17:46,403 --> 01:17:50,444
Rather now, if you do not mind. - A little bit.

1028
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:53,735
Anyway, let's do it.

1029
01:17:53,861 --> 01:17:56,610
Let's start here. Come with me.

1030
01:17:56,736 --> 01:18:00,403
All together. How are you?

1031
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:05,152
With or without glasses? - Does not matter.

1032
01:18:05,278 --> 01:18:07,527
Cheese. - Here we go.

1033
01:18:07,653 --> 01:18:11,944
Very nice. Oh, my God. He trembles. I hearts.

1034
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:13,486
Hearts.

1035
01:18:17,028 --> 01:18:20,277
Excuse me. Can we get some wine?

1036
01:18:20,403 --> 01:18:27,110
Certainly. Also coffee and the bill? - No, thank you, young man.

1037
01:18:27,236 --> 01:18:30,736
This is Julien, a former colleague and friend ...

1038
01:18:30,945 --> 01:18:35,319
that is also of Pierre family. - From far away, though.

1039
01:18:35,445 --> 01:18:41,485
Now everyone is all family. - You can not say that ...

1040
01:18:41,611 --> 01:18:43,195
Pardon?

1041
01:18:44,403 --> 01:18:45,820
Cheers, everyone.

1042
01:18:52,611 --> 01:18:57,527
What you cop to me. You work in white and is here to sip champagne.

1043
01:18:57,653 --> 01:19:01,360
Everyone drinks. Can I do something that I work in white.

1044
01:19:01,486 --> 01:19:04,445
Back to back. And fast.

1045
01:19:07,153 --> 01:19:09,236
It's a balmy evening.

1046
01:19:10,570 --> 01:19:13,360
come all on the dance floor.

1047
01:19:13,486 --> 01:19:16,486
I want one more look at the table.

1048
01:19:18,486 --> 01:19:21,570
Get up, or I ask Pierre to another speech.

1049
01:19:22,945 --> 01:19:27,194
Peter Helena. Helena Stone.

1050
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:31,235
For better or for worse. For us here tonight.

1051
01:19:31,361 --> 01:19:35,777
All together. For love and music.

1052
01:19:35,903 --> 01:19:38,610
Let's dance for them.

1053
01:19:38,736 --> 01:19:40,736
Hands in the air.

1054
01:19:43,695 --> 01:19:45,195
Hoi.

1055
01:19:47,028 --> 01:19:48,570
Everything good?

1056
01:19:54,611 --> 01:19:58,611
It is a wonderful evening with James Live Band.

1057
01:20:00,653 --> 01:20:03,070
Do you happen to me ...

1058
01:20:05,111 --> 01:20:06,736
My bad, good night.

1059
01:20:21,570 --> 01:20:24,320
Skin to skin.

1060
01:21:10,361 --> 01:21:13,695
And now let the napkins but fluttering.

1061
01:21:26,111 --> 01:21:29,736
The wings of love.

1062
01:22:06,778 --> 01:22:12,402
Enough now, you're looking for me. But let me do what I say.

1063
01:22:12,528 --> 01:22:16,277
We are a small company, which always needs staff.

1064
01:22:16,403 --> 01:22:20,235
I want to take everyone in the service, but it is complicated.

1065
01:22:20,361 --> 01:22:24,235
If I pay someone $ 100, cost me 200 euros.

1066
01:22:24,361 --> 01:22:26,902
I sense that they pay black.

1067
01:22:27,028 --> 01:22:31,110
If no one helps the little boss, people will cheat.

1068
01:22:31,236 --> 01:22:34,444
In addition, they put us constantly breathing down the neck.

1069
01:22:34,570 --> 01:22:39,360
We have already lost the tax when you hire new people.

1070
01:22:39,486 --> 01:22:42,777
And complaining about youth employment and internships.

1071
01:22:42,903 --> 01:22:45,027
But no one does anything.

1072
01:22:45,153 --> 01:22:48,319
Inspect, check, go ahead.

1073
01:22:48,445 --> 01:22:53,735
Remove the empty tent, I'm okay. Do you want my shirt and jacket?

1074
01:22:53,861 --> 01:22:56,985
Wait a second. Keep it on your clothes.

1075
01:22:57,111 --> 01:23:00,694
I Valéry Laprade. We texted.

1076
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:04,360
I'm here for the possible acquisition.

1077
01:23:04,486 --> 01:23:09,402
Laprade? Valery ... Bent u Laprade?

1078
01:23:09,528 --> 01:23:12,402
I understood it all out.

1079
01:23:12,528 --> 01:23:15,610
About those costs, youth ...

1080
01:23:15,736 --> 01:23:17,610
I was scared to death.

1081
01:23:17,736 --> 01:23:20,444
I just did not understand well.

1082
01:23:20,570 --> 01:23:24,027
I had you, say. - You had me for sure.

1083
01:23:24,153 --> 01:23:27,861
What do you do with a briefcase, Valéry?

1084
01:23:29,028 --> 01:23:31,819
I work for the Social Security.

1085
01:23:31,945 --> 01:23:37,195
Of course not. - Now you have to stop ... False alarm.

1086
01:23:37,361 --> 01:23:40,944
Excuse me. But I expected a Valerie.

1087
01:23:41,070 --> 01:23:44,569
Your first name is very original.

1088
01:23:44,695 --> 01:23:47,944
It happens to you probably not for the first time.

1089
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:51,152
It does not matter. - Can you still keep silent?

1090
01:23:51,278 --> 01:23:53,819
Nobody knows of the acquisition plans.

1091
01:23:53,945 --> 01:23:57,610
Obviously. You do have a great appeal.

1092
01:23:57,736 --> 01:24:01,360
It is magic, all that happiness around you.

1093
01:24:01,486 --> 01:24:02,986
Yes, truly magical.

1094
01:24:04,945 --> 01:24:08,819
Can I speak to you from the heart? - Yes of course.

1095
01:24:08,945 --> 01:24:12,694
Much of the revenue is fixed cash.

1096
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:14,236
Listen...

1097
01:24:16,445 --> 01:24:21,569
Are you really Laprade? I do not tell anyone of the Security Office.

1098
01:24:21,695 --> 01:24:27,402
Surely I as an inspector? - No no. You look very ...

1099
01:24:27,528 --> 01:24:29,444
Yes? - Good looking.

1100
01:24:29,570 --> 01:24:31,902
You look fine.

1101
01:24:32,028 --> 01:24:35,403
You do yourself no wrong.

1102
01:24:38,611 --> 01:24:40,985
Thank you, Valéry.

1103
01:24:41,111 --> 01:24:45,944
You still get my text? - Yes, and I answered.

1104
01:24:46,070 --> 01:24:47,570
You wrote:

1105
01:24:47,778 --> 01:24:52,944
"When you're there, ask me, I'll lick you right away."

1106
01:24:53,070 --> 01:24:56,860
You are kidding me. What a disaster that is the auto correction.

1107
01:24:56,986 --> 01:25:00,610
I do not check it. I should do it.

1108
01:25:00,736 --> 01:25:04,110
Thought so, because we have not met properly.

1109
01:25:04,236 --> 01:25:06,070
No, it is.

1110
01:25:07,736 --> 01:25:11,735
Here's my offer. - Thank you.

1111
01:25:11,861 --> 01:25:16,319
Let's discuss the details shortly. We'll keep in touch.

1112
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:20,695
We can send text messages. With or without auto-correction.

1113
01:25:22,695 --> 01:25:25,319
Very well. - See you soon.

1114
01:25:25,445 --> 01:25:27,820
I hope so. Bye.

1115
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:32,736
Valéry? Valery due.

1116
01:25:37,377 --> 01:25:39,819
23:54 pm

1117
01:25:39,945 --> 01:25:42,027
We go for a nice finale.

1118
01:25:42,153 --> 01:25:44,278
Really succeed with the fireworks, Samy?

1119
01:25:44,445 --> 01:25:48,360
I've spent years July 14 when I worked at City Hall.

1120
01:25:48,486 --> 01:25:51,569
Everything is ready. I hardly have to do anything.

1121
01:25:51,695 --> 01:25:55,444
Seb, stay with him. We coordinate things.

1122
01:25:55,570 --> 01:25:58,902
If the surprise of the groom is over, the music stops.

1123
01:25:59,028 --> 01:26:02,610
And we stabbing it off only on my sign.

1124
01:26:02,736 --> 01:26:06,944
So keep your phone in mind. I'll call you and say: Go.

1125
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:09,611
Is that clear? - Or a text message.

1126
01:26:11,861 --> 01:26:15,195
Too risky. - Yes Yes. Of course. Well done.

1127
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:19,735
So I call and say, Go.

1128
01:26:19,861 --> 01:26:23,402
Is it better to that girl helium show?

1129
01:26:23,528 --> 01:26:27,944
Something. She needs some help to hold the ropes.

1130
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:31,235
Adele and Julien, you help her.

1131
01:26:31,361 --> 01:26:35,527
I see how it is with the dessert. - I'll go.

1132
01:26:35,653 --> 01:26:39,736
No. You stand at the entrance of the castle ...

1133
01:26:40,528 --> 01:26:46,070
and you see if the fence is sturdy enough. If it does not move.

1134
01:26:47,903 --> 01:26:50,152
I must guard the gate? - Yes.

1135
01:26:50,278 --> 01:26:53,986
You should discuss endlessly about everywhere?

1136
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:57,528
To work.

1137
01:27:00,861 --> 01:27:02,569
Then I'll go. - Yes.

1138
01:27:02,695 --> 01:27:07,902
It is a kind of air show, so draw a parrot costume with orange feathers.

1139
01:27:08,028 --> 01:27:11,360
What? That still beats no sense at all.

1140
01:27:11,486 --> 01:27:15,527
That face of yours. You see, I can too.

1141
01:27:15,653 --> 01:27:18,944
Should I dress again? - Of course not.

1142
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:22,028
We serve coffee and then we can go to bed.

1143
01:27:26,153 --> 01:27:30,110
Are you ready? Time is running out. - No, my mother is lost.

1144
01:27:30,236 --> 01:27:33,277
I can not start without her.

1145
01:27:33,403 --> 01:27:36,194
I want to find her, but then they see me.

1146
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:42,444
I get it, but we can go from the town until half past twelve.

1147
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:45,360
Not now.

1148
01:27:45,486 --> 01:27:48,110
I can not act without her.

1149
01:27:48,236 --> 01:27:52,486
We're going to look for mother. Leave it to us.

1150
01:27:52,653 --> 01:27:55,444
Yes, Roshan? - It is a pity.

1151
01:27:55,570 --> 01:27:57,402
I had found an excuse.

1152
01:27:57,528 --> 01:28:01,153
Very well, hold on. You never know with him.

1153
01:28:07,861 --> 01:28:09,819
Hello.

1154
01:28:09,945 --> 01:28:13,819
What are you doing here? - I have Guy guarding the gate.

1155
01:28:13,945 --> 01:28:16,945
Apparently part of my internship.

1156
01:28:24,403 --> 01:28:28,110
Mom? Where were you?

1157
01:28:28,236 --> 01:28:30,527
I had to get some air.

1158
01:28:30,653 --> 01:28:34,485
We've been looking everywhere. - Oh yeah?

1159
01:28:34,611 --> 01:28:38,444
What I smell now? A weird smell. - Pierre.

1160
01:28:38,570 --> 01:28:40,653
Smell that? That smell fair?

1161
01:28:42,070 --> 01:28:43,610
You smell of churros.

1162
01:28:43,736 --> 01:28:47,360
We should really begin. - Sit down, Mom.

1163
01:28:47,486 --> 01:28:51,485
He has a sensitive nose. He had as a boy.

1164
01:28:51,611 --> 01:28:54,235
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?

1165
01:28:54,361 --> 01:28:57,277
Yes, it's me again. Will you stand ...

1166
01:28:57,403 --> 01:29:02,194
Where were you, Genevieve? - I just made a detour.

1167
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:05,485
Are you coming? It is a surprise.

1168
01:29:05,611 --> 01:29:09,360
I knew nothing about. - It is therefore a surprise.

1169
01:29:09,486 --> 01:29:13,819
Of course you did not know. - What have you cooked up?

1170
01:29:13,945 --> 01:29:20,486
It is poetry, beauty and love tonight Héléna and Pierre.

1171
01:29:20,653 --> 01:29:23,527
Dat is love apple.

1172
01:29:23,653 --> 01:29:26,110
Say you have not done.

1173
01:29:26,236 --> 01:29:31,319
They also are looking for via GPS. That is revolutionary. Geolocation.

1174
01:29:31,445 --> 01:29:34,986
This is an app. I lay still out. - You are sick.

1175
01:32:30,611 --> 01:32:33,736
What is happening? This was not the intention.

1176
01:32:36,820 --> 01:32:38,235
Idiot.

1177
01:32:38,361 --> 01:32:40,777
What are you doing now?

1178
01:32:40,903 --> 01:32:43,485
Pull not, idiot. Julien.

1179
01:32:43,611 --> 01:32:45,611
You are ruining my show.

1180
01:34:06,528 --> 01:34:08,653
Damn.

1181
01:34:11,028 --> 01:34:15,070
Oh no. You can not be serious.

1182
01:34:15,778 --> 01:34:20,277
They can use some of that French. You have to give them credit.

1183
01:34:20,403 --> 01:34:25,444
They are very inventive and know how to build a party.

1184
01:34:25,570 --> 01:34:27,986
Clover Lord? - No.

1185
01:34:28,153 --> 01:34:30,652
Shovels? - No.

1186
01:34:30,778 --> 01:34:33,819
Hartenvrouw? - No, you will not know.

1187
01:34:33,945 --> 01:34:35,945
She let go of the balloons.

1188
01:34:36,611 --> 01:34:40,778
Do I have anything stand out? - He'd call. Did he call?

1189
01:34:41,070 --> 01:34:43,486
Insert only a few off.

1190
01:34:47,528 --> 01:34:50,694
Where's my son? - I think that he...

1191
01:34:50,820 --> 01:34:53,486
The fresh air will do him good.

1192
01:34:55,195 --> 01:34:56,611
That is a problem.

1193
01:35:03,653 --> 01:35:06,486
What is he doing? I do not 'go' said.

1194
01:35:15,361 --> 01:35:16,778
Good gracious.

1195
01:35:22,403 --> 01:35:25,445
Did you not 'go' say? - No.

1196
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:29,319
What did I say? Unbelievable.

1197
01:35:29,445 --> 01:35:33,902
We coordinate it, I said. Did I say that right?

1198
01:35:34,028 --> 01:35:37,194
But no one is listening for each other.

1199
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:42,653
I can always make up for your mistakes. Driving mileage to save the evening.

1200
01:35:42,820 --> 01:35:46,027
We do everything, but we make it.

1201
01:35:46,153 --> 01:35:49,320
And then you mess it up in one minute.

1202
01:35:50,361 --> 01:35:55,610
Shall I tell you something? I have for months, for years had with you.

1203
01:35:55,736 --> 01:35:59,569
You, with your shit all the time.

1204
01:35:59,695 --> 01:36:05,402
I asked you a hundred times to set a good example.

1205
01:36:05,528 --> 01:36:10,694
And you're talking about respect and decency. Where is your respect for me, Adele?

1206
01:36:10,820 --> 01:36:12,945
Where is your respect?

1207
01:36:14,028 --> 01:36:18,610
But knocking the truck, a day off, money ...

1208
01:36:18,736 --> 01:36:24,277
a job for a nephew. Those good old Max adjusts it for us.

1209
01:36:24,403 --> 01:36:27,444
But what you do for me?

1210
01:36:27,570 --> 01:36:31,819
Where I earned you my whole life?

1211
01:36:31,945 --> 01:36:35,110
For you it is a summer camp here.

1212
01:36:35,236 --> 01:36:39,235
You there. You a little volvreten at the buffet.

1213
01:36:39,361 --> 01:36:41,860
offend customers.

1214
01:36:41,986 --> 01:36:45,195
Is that the way you show your gratitude?

1215
01:36:46,236 --> 01:36:47,902
I'll tell you what, Guy?

1216
01:36:48,028 --> 01:36:52,236
There's no one with such a freak if you want to work.

1217
01:36:53,611 --> 01:36:57,985
And then that other moron. Running to decorate the bride.

1218
01:36:58,111 --> 01:37:00,445
Are you crazy?

1219
01:37:01,403 --> 01:37:05,694
You're a bunch of deadbeats and losers.

1220
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:11,569
But no one has me risking my ass. Every night.

1221
01:37:11,695 --> 01:37:15,444
It cares nothing you. Nobody cares about me.

1222
01:37:15,570 --> 01:37:18,944
Let the boss figuring it.

1223
01:37:19,070 --> 01:37:22,819
Are you tired of my head? I have very good news.

1224
01:37:22,945 --> 01:37:26,402
It's over. You will not see me again.

1225
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:27,945
It is over.

1226
01:37:29,778 --> 01:37:32,860
It is 500 meters landed in a field.

1227
01:37:32,986 --> 01:37:37,610
Good news: he is unharmed. I'm sorry that it happened.

1228
01:37:37,736 --> 01:37:40,986
But we're still at least an hour in the dark.

1229
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:49,027
Max? What must we do? - That's not my problem anymore.

1230
01:37:49,153 --> 01:37:50,778
Find out for yourself.

1231
01:37:55,278 --> 01:37:57,486
I think Max angry.

1232
01:37:59,278 --> 01:38:02,570
Is not it? - Yes.

1233
01:38:14,070 --> 01:38:21,027
Ah, Nicole. No, you bother at all. I enjoyed a quiet moment.

1234
01:38:21,153 --> 01:38:24,111
I gotta talk to you, as I said.

1235
01:38:25,361 --> 01:38:31,653
How do I say this? No, go ahead. You called me.

1236
01:38:32,778 --> 01:38:37,195
You wanted some distance. As I understand it.

1237
01:38:41,236 --> 01:38:43,486
O, that kind of distance.

1238
01:38:48,861 --> 01:38:50,486
For how long?

1239
01:38:52,153 --> 01:38:53,736
So long?

1240
01:39:00,528 --> 01:39:02,403
Yes of course.

1241
01:39:04,403 --> 01:39:08,277
Who is it? Do I know him?

1242
01:39:08,403 --> 01:39:10,528
Not?

1243
01:39:11,695 --> 01:39:16,111
Good. I'd better go back again.

1244
01:39:16,278 --> 01:39:20,486
Everything is going very well. See you.

1245
01:39:35,945 --> 01:39:39,028
But of course.

1246
01:39:51,236 --> 01:39:52,653
Blow.

1247
01:39:54,278 --> 01:39:56,028
Heartily.

1248
01:40:02,528 --> 01:40:04,694
I have a theory, Max.

1249
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:11,069
If everything seems to sit, remember that you can look differently at it.

1250
01:40:11,195 --> 01:40:14,653
Perhaps it is super fine.

1251
01:40:16,236 --> 01:40:19,235
Good theory. - Absolutely.

1252
01:40:19,361 --> 01:40:23,028
And do you know why? Because he is positive.

1253
01:40:24,403 --> 01:40:28,527
I know you're angry, but everyone makes mistakes.

1254
01:40:28,653 --> 01:40:33,777
Even I make mistakes sometimes. It is true.

1255
01:40:33,903 --> 01:40:36,569
My entire career has been based on it.

1256
01:40:36,695 --> 01:40:40,444
I'd be a reporter. - I did not know that.

1257
01:40:40,570 --> 01:40:43,861
I'll tell you? - No do not bother.

1258
01:40:52,986 --> 01:40:54,528
You know, Guy ...

1259
01:40:56,445 --> 01:41:03,445
We are so close together that I have to tell the truth.

1260
01:41:05,111 --> 01:41:08,695
I wanted to tell you earlier, but when I was ...

1261
01:41:09,736 --> 01:41:13,986
When it was not good. But...

1262
01:41:15,403 --> 01:41:18,236
It is increasingly difficult to hire you.

1263
01:41:20,278 --> 01:41:26,944
Customers will no longer photographer. Their nephew can too.

1264
01:41:27,070 --> 01:41:29,153
They do not want a photographer anymore.

1265
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:38,611
But I do my best for you.

1266
01:41:40,070 --> 01:41:41,653
I know that.

1267
01:41:49,611 --> 01:41:55,445
They need you. - No, I'm going home. I'm exhausted.

1268
01:42:13,945 --> 01:42:15,361
What is this?

1269
01:45:13,426 --> 01:45:16,945
5:18 pm

1270
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:30,360
You know what I did there? - I have a suspicion.

1271
01:45:30,486 --> 01:45:35,110
"I kill him, that jerk." - Something I thought so, yes.

1272
01:45:35,236 --> 01:45:39,777
They only had to hold two ropes. Even that did not work.

1273
01:45:39,903 --> 01:45:45,360
Where did you find them? That must have been really very difficult.

1274
01:45:45,486 --> 01:45:50,027
It's really beautiful. A great moment.

1275
01:45:50,153 --> 01:45:53,069
So graceful, so harmonious.

1276
01:45:53,195 --> 01:45:59,445
What did your team is just really extraordinary.

1277
01:46:00,986 --> 01:46:03,652
No, we are really enchanted.

1278
01:46:03,778 --> 01:46:08,652
That's exactly what Pierre said, in his words then. More or less.

1279
01:46:08,778 --> 01:46:13,110
And have you seen your mother? She is another woman. She exudes.

1280
01:46:13,236 --> 01:46:16,861
Yes, she looks pleased. Fortunately even.

1281
01:46:17,945 --> 01:46:20,444
Thank you.

1282
01:46:20,570 --> 01:46:23,319
I really mean that. - That is very nice.

1283
01:46:23,445 --> 01:46:27,861
We have to say goodbye to the Lemants. - I'm coming.

1284
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:32,111
Thanks then.

1285
01:47:16,070 --> 01:47:20,652
I had Nicole on the line. It is pronounced.

1286
01:47:20,778 --> 01:47:23,777
So no mystery hassle? - No.

1287
01:47:23,903 --> 01:47:27,402
Do you then kiss with Patrice?

1288
01:47:27,528 --> 01:47:29,861
Yes, I love you on.

1289
01:47:38,361 --> 01:47:41,235
And? How did she?

1290
01:47:41,361 --> 01:47:45,236
Nicole knows how to take the proper distance.

1291
01:47:49,528 --> 01:47:53,985
Friends. Do you have a minute?

1292
01:47:54,111 --> 01:47:56,110
Please.

1293
01:47:56,236 --> 01:48:01,194
Rest assured, I will not hold more long sermon.

1294
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:06,985
I just wanted to thank you for tonight.

1295
01:48:07,111 --> 01:48:12,528
... I was really touched.

1296
01:48:14,820 --> 01:48:16,820
Yes, deeply.

1297
01:48:19,236 --> 01:48:24,986
If you now sit with something ...

1298
01:48:26,028 --> 01:48:30,778
A problem or question, pointing you to Adele.

1299
01:48:32,528 --> 01:48:35,736
They will inform you now.

1300
01:48:38,820 --> 01:48:40,570
Go ahead.

1301
01:48:41,653 --> 01:48:47,152
Tuesday I'll see you at two o'clock in the Salon de la Reine in Boulogne.

1302
01:48:47,278 --> 01:48:51,486
Half to two department heads. As usual.

1303
01:48:53,486 --> 01:48:57,278
There. Until Tuesday then.

1304
01:48:58,278 --> 01:48:59,736
Thank you.

1305
01:49:02,445 --> 01:49:04,028
Day, sweetie.

1306
01:49:05,028 --> 01:49:06,486
Till Tuesday.

1307
01:49:14,528 --> 01:49:15,945
Etienne?

1308
01:49:18,820 --> 01:49:22,695
I will bring you home. If you're good, you get a jacket.

1309
01:49:24,153 --> 01:49:26,486
I stop weddings, Max.

1310
01:49:27,570 --> 01:49:28,986
For real?

1311
01:49:29,153 --> 01:49:34,070
I want to be a reporter again, smelling the danger.

1312
01:49:35,361 --> 01:49:41,110
There is no buffet, huh. - I want to return to the real thing.

1313
01:49:41,236 --> 01:49:44,402
If you want to make is that good.

1314
01:49:44,528 --> 01:49:47,277
Just kidding, I'll see you Tuesday. - Guy, anyway.

1315
01:49:47,403 --> 01:49:50,194
Till Tuesday.

1316
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:52,694
The age difference is too great.

1317
01:49:52,820 --> 01:49:57,278
And she's an independent woman. For her a uniform.

1318
01:49:58,236 --> 01:50:01,069
Max and his Josiane together?

1319
01:50:01,195 --> 01:50:04,777
Yes, but does anyone if they do not know.

1320
01:50:04,903 --> 01:50:07,111
Why do you think?

1321
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:09,778
That's France. You need to get some integrate you.

1322
01:50:12,361 --> 01:50:18,152
I'll back off on the corner? Otherwise they see me with you, a cop.

1323
01:50:18,278 --> 01:50:19,861
Yes, on the corner.

1324
01:50:29,570 --> 01:50:32,236
Is there no one who will take me home?

1325
01:50:34,153 --> 01:50:37,360
Yes. I, if you want.

1326
01:50:37,486 --> 01:50:39,903
That would be very nice.

1327
01:50:41,070 --> 01:50:44,652
Where do you park? - I'm walking.

1328
01:50:44,778 --> 01:50:47,444
So you bring me to walk home? - Yes.

1329
01:50:47,570 --> 01:50:50,402
I do not walk very self.

1330
01:50:50,528 --> 01:50:53,778
That sentence is syntactically incorrect.
