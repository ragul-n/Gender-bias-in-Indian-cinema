00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:12,029
Sir, may I help you?
-I’ve a reservation for tonight.

177
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,591
My flight got cancelled and they gave me
a room in this hotel.

178
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,434
What's this sir? So wet.

179
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,702
That's...-Was the receipt.
It’s wet because, it's wet outside.

180
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,031
It’s raining, I’m also wet.

181
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:22,340
You're Mr.Anbarasu?

182
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:26,042
No, I’m Mr.A.Aras.

183
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:29,409
Okay, Mr. Anbarasu, your
Room Number is 213.

184
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:33,951
Yes sir.

185
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:34,619
My key.

186
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,014
Your close friend is waiting there.

187
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,048
My...Who? -Mr.Sivam, sir.

188
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:54,466
Yes, come in.

189
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,776
Keep the coffee on the table.

190
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:01,312
What coffee?

191
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,205
l thought, I had heard this
voice somewhere.

192
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:04,973
Mr.Aras, welcome.

193
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,310
Now, you're calling me by my name.

194
00:13:06,518 --> 00:13:08,486
Then, why did you say ''Anbarasu'' in
the reception?

195
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,015
Why? Full name.

196
00:13:10,522 --> 00:13:11,716
l don't like ANBU.(love)

197
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:13,584
Sir, you shouldn't hate love.

198
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,417
''Those who don't love are selfish''...
Those who love''....

199
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,257
Wow! You speak Oriya Language also?

200
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,425
Sir, it's very bad...

201
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:26,594
It’s Tamil! Mr.Thiruvalluvar, white beard,
man near Sanskrit college, Mylapore.

202
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:27,430
Statute....sitting.

203
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,106
Listen.

204
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:28,773
Don't bore me.

205
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,297
I’ve had really bad day.

206
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,102
I’m very angry that...

207
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,275
Shall I say one thing?

208
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,209
I know, what you are going to say...

209
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,211
You're going to ask me one thing.

210
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,782
I know, what you're going to ask me...

211
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,920
I should ask you why you’re after me

212
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,781
I haven’t asked even that
So, what else will I ask?

213
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,124
You'll say.....

214
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,121
Like a Kangaroo's baby ...

215
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,954
l kept this safely in my front pocket
and brought it without getting wet.

216
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,459
You might've suffered a lot
without this, haven't you?

217
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,431
No thanks.

218
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,299
You can make a call here itself.
Is it a personal call?

219
00:13:59,004 --> 00:13:59,629
Is it a "love call'?

220
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:00,561
No such thing.....

221
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:04,140
I too don't have one KAAL(leg)
and one KAI(hand).

222
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:09,809
Hi handsome.

223
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,314
After taking bath, I’m looking
a bit handsome.

224
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,000
Sorry...l kept them outside...

225
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,835
Oh! I placed my leg on them just now.

226
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:32,362
Thank you.

227
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,773
You returned my phone, I returned
your bags. We're even.

228
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,337
What's this? Bad smell is coming.

229
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,571
l...

230
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,344
Oh! You're...! Go and take bath.

231
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:46,680
I want to make a call.

232
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:51,013
Sir, make a call later.
Otherwise, you won't get hot water. Go...

233
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:51,689
Okay.

234
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,022
Hello, Mr.A.Aras has gone
for his bath.

235
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:57,695
Give me that.

236
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,197
Sir, what's all this?

237
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,365
l only said Aras, not 'Anbarasu'.
-I know.

238
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,227
l didn't mean that.
l didn't enter the bathroom.

239
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:03,164
l can't attend the call.

240
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,532
Sir, this is from "public call office'.

241
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,539
I know that, that's my office, man.
You too...

242
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:08,804
Why didn't you call me
from your house?

243
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:10,374
Did they make a call?

244
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,509
Missed calls? Okay.
Ask them to phone me again.

245
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,143
Sir, you received missed calls.
....Why didn't you...

246
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,213
Sir, there were 4 missed calls.

247
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,044
You get angry when I handle
your cell in your presence.

248
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,219
How can I take your calls
in your absence?

249
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,387
4 missed calls.

250
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,719
Sir, who is Sarasu?

251
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,387
She is my....

252
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:28,955
How do you know?

253
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:33,224
l read ''Sarasu'' on those missed calls.
Sir, who's she?

254
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,225
Do you want to know everything?

255
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,728
What I know is little, what
I don't know is vast...

256
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,571
I’ll take bath and come.

257
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:43,237
You're taking that like a soap...
Take this towel...

258
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,005
One more thing is that
the hot water shower...

259
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,477
Hey, thank you very much
I’ll manage.

260
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:52,576
What I mean is...
When I opened it...

261
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,345
Sir, why've you hanged it
like this?

262
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:57,747
Underwear.

263
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,084
Why have you hanged it
like a "party flag'?

264
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,859
l thought I could at least
wash that and wear.

265
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:03,994
Sir, you put it aside
and take bath.

266
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,260
How? -With your hand.

267
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,262
It’s washed. You put it aside
and take bath.

268
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,102
Then, that shower head
is a bit...

269
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,936
Oh God! I know, I’ve taken shower
bath several times.

270
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,942
l didn't mean that.
That shower head is...

271
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:27,211
I’ll manage, leave me alone.
-Sir, what was the noise?

272
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:29,954
Sir, nothing. I kicked the
bloody bucket, man.

273
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,123
Why did you shout after
kicking the bucket?

274
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,118
Oh God! Sir, I’ve kicked
the bucket.

275
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,120
Do you've to cross examine
me for everything?

276
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:52,941
Yeah, just a minute.
-May I come in, sir?

277
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:53,544
Come in.

278
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:55,872
What? Man...

279
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,645
Sorry sir, coffee.

280
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,839
You poured it on my head, man.

281
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,146
l was opening the door, isn't it?

282
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,547
Before that, why did you
say "Come in'?

283
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:04,381
When he asked, "May I come in?',

284
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,182
We're supposed to say
'Come in', shouldn't we?

285
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:09,024
Sir, shower head fell on your head.

286
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,456
And you lied that you
kicked the bucket.

287
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,861
Sir, why didn't you inform me
that shower head is not secure?

288
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:15,158
Sir, I wanted to tell you...

289
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,536
You cut me short and said that you've
taken shower bath several times.

290
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,204
Then, we were talking
about my underwear.

291
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:21,372
After that also, I tried
to warn you...

292
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,768
You didn't listen to me...
And got hurt.

293
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:25,202
You can give 1000's of excuses.

294
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:26,878
You're an expert at that.

295
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:30,040
Sir, you've got a big lump.

296
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:33,316
Sir, it's alright, if there's bleeding,
it'll be a problem. -Why?

297
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,884
Because, my blood group
is 'AB Negative'. It’s a rare group.

298
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,783
l know sir, I’m 'O Positive'.

299
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:39,890
l....

300
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:43,559
You too have 'O'...
You said 'AB Negative'.

301
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,064
I’m AB Negative. You're 'O'...

302
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,061
What I mean is....

303
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,924
Bloody confusion.

304
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:49,567
Phone call.

305
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,435
Hello, Hi honey, Aras here.

306
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:59,769
Yes, here there's a cyclone
and heavy floods.

307
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,310
Train, plane...everything
is cancelled.

308
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,276
What could I do? Cell was not with me.

309
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:11,254
No...It’s not cyclone.
It’s a pillow.

310
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:12,490
It’s a fellow.

311
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:13,157
No...

312
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:14,825
It’s a fellow with a pillow.

313
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:16,653
That cyclone is better than this....

314
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:17,829
I’ll come outside and talk...
Just a minute....

315
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:18,663
He...?

316
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:19,922
Very nice gentleman.

317
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,166
He's my friend whom I met here.

318
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:22,830
He's very irritating and
a pain in my neck...

319
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,999
He asks questions and gives
suggestions for everything.

320
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,806
Thinking he’s helping me
he’s pestering me. Hello...

321
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,402
No...Will you call from the land line?

322
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:31,509
Just a minute...I’ll give
you the numbers.

323
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,841
This place? It’s a God forsaken hotel.

324
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:37,644
Hello, open the door.

325
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:38,713
Open the door, please.

326
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,474
Yeah...Yeah...please....

327
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,851
l can't tell you.
He's a real joker.

328
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:45,589
He's not the joker of 'Rummy'.
He's a real joker. Real joker.

329
00:18:46,124 --> 00:18:47,751
Mother, you too have started
talking like him...

330
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,258
Oh God! Sir...Sir...

331
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,427
Thank God, you swim and come out....

332
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,696
No, I can't swim.

333
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,601
Sir, won't you speak in Tamil
even while you're dying?

334
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,769
l can't swim....

335
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,774
Say like that.

336
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,614
You hold this and come out.

337
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,950
''A talented person can
use even a pillow''.

338
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:14,948
Is that all necessary now?

339
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,484
Sorry sir.

340
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:21,989
I feel very sorry...-Why?

341
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:22,990
Because I didn't die?

342
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:24,821
Sir, don't talk like that.

343
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:26,331
Think in this way...

344
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:28,999
You were sorry that you didn't get a
room in a 5 Star Hotel. lf you had,

345
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,668
The room could've been on
the 5th or 6th floor...

346
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,064
lf you had fallen down from there...
-Sir, won't you ever think positively?

347
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,007
It’s not that....Sorry.....

348
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,342
Sir, don't plug it.

349
00:19:38,543 --> 00:19:41,341
Because, micro processor
might be wet.

350
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:42,843
Even at the petrol bunk, they warn
not to switch on the cell.

351
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,015
Because, it can cause fire

352
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,013
Sir, you claim to know everything.
Don't I know anything?

353
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:47,184
It’s not that...

354
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:48,080
Let me do my work, man.

355
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,687
Go ahead...go ahead.

356
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,856
You give your opinion and
suggestion for everything.

357
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,285
l mean there's a limit to everything.

358
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:56,356
Am I a child to be advised
all the time...

359
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,155
Sir, don't I know about electronics?

360
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,661
l have used and charged
cell phones many times!

361
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:09,840
Don't talk....

362
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:11,668
Don't laugh....

363
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:14,675
It happens man.

364
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,509
Hello...Hello...Please tell me.

365
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,747
Reception? I want to make an
urgent call to Chennai, please.

366
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:25,722
Sorry sir, no STD
-No STD! Trunk call? -No.

367
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:27,253
Messaging? -No sir.

368
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,359
E-Mail? -No sir
Telegram? -No.

369
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:30,386
Then, how?

370
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,022
Pigeon...-Yes...Pigeon....

371
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,525
Pura?(Pigeon) What Pura?
Pardon me.

372
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,528
Pigeon...? What do you mean?

373
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,197
Very funny...Thank you.

374
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,035
We'll become old by the
time we reach Chennai.

375
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:43,366
Sir, only now, I’m happy. -Why?

376
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,876
You've a sense of humour.

377
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,375
But, I don't know, whether I can
smile or not? Can I smile?

378
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,740
Only couples come to this hotel?
They've kept only one bed.

379
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,250
Now, we've share this and....

380
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,684
Sir, I didn't mean that...

381
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,016
You tell me where do you
want to sleep and I...

382
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:03,592
No...I’ll sleep on the floor.
Because, I have a bad back.

383
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:06,263
In the spinal chord, there's a slip disk.
Disc-Slip...Accident -You know.

384
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:08,098
l should sleep only on hard surface.

385
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,425
Are you sure, you want to...

386
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:11,925
Are you okay?

387
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:12,796
Yeah...yeah....

388
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,601
Are you sure, you're okay?

389
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,205
Okay...okay...-Okay, then.

390
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:18,242
Good night Mr.Sivam.

391
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:23,840
Unbelievable.

392
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:27,685
What? -Cyclones, rains...winds...

393
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,514
These are common in Orissa.
People face them every year.

394
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,956
Every year, they say
it'll hit Chennai.

395
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:36,093
But, it hits only Orissa and Andhra...
It’s a great pity!

396
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,028
Sir, you can see a huge wave here.

397
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,356
Sir, you can see 'Tsunami' here.

398
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,862
Sir, do you know the meaning of 'Tsunami'?

399
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,532
l know the meaning of "Tsunami'.
-Tell me, what's it?

400
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,197
That is....That big wave.

401
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:47,701
Very good.

402
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:49,200
No...It’s a big mountain.

403
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,368
You've studied abroad, haven't you?

404
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,635
Sir, tell me the height
of "Liberty Statue'?

405
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:55,703
300 feet.-Very good.

406
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,711
Why do you say "very good' for everything.
Is it an examination?

407
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,713
No, sir it's just an appreciation
of your knowledge.

408
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,047
You said the height of
Liberty Statue is 300 ft.

409
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,983
Here, it seems the waves will
be 250 ft. high.

410
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:07,551
In Orissa? -Yes, sir.

411
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:08,559
They said.

412
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,226
Impossible.

413
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,396
I’ve only heard. But, we can find a wave
about 50 ft. high in Danushkodi.

414
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,400
Sir, don't you think
it's an "over exaggeration'?

415
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,728
No, it's not.

416
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,733
Such a wave swept away my father.

417
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:21,401
What do you mean?

418
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:22,569
l mean, it swept away my father.

419
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,332
My father was very
interested in photography.

420
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:26,672
He asked me to click his
snap with the swell of the wave.

421
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,072
He said ''It’ll look nice''.

422
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,144
We got a good print of the wave.
But father was gone.

423
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:32,480
What do you mean by that?

424
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:35,745
We didn't even get his body.
It means he died, isn't it?

425
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:44,996
I’m sorry, Mr.Sivam.

426
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,960
Excuse me, I’d like a first class ticket
to Chennai please, by Coromandel Express.

427
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:53,860
All trains cancelled.

428
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:54,798
What?

429
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:55,555
Cancelled.

430
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,525
Excuse me, I’m a Tax-payer.
You're answerable to me.

431
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:00,864
Tell me one good reason why I can't
take a train to Chennai?

432
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,199
What's this?...What's this?
Pointing....

433
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:14,551
Is it a railway station
or a harbour? -What?

434
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:15,219
What?

435
00:24:16,187 --> 00:24:16,812
Nothing man...

436
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,716
Time! -It’s a bad time.
-Time! Time!

437
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:27,964
Hey stop!...Thief... Police...
Emergency...Ambulance! Stop! Stop!

438
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,900
Stop... Wait... stop...

439
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,572
You.. you.. you... Thief.

440
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,499
Oh God! I don't know how to swim.

441
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:39,838
Stop him, he's running with my purse.

442
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,076
Thief! Dacoit! Stop him!

443
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,247
Hey stop!.. Give me my purse.

444
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,010
Don't try to beat me...

445
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:49,413
Whatever it is, we'll adjust.

446
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,257
Stop.. Stop man!

447
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,922
Catch.. catch.. stop.. stop!

448
00:24:58,964 --> 00:24:59,931
Don't know whether he
knows English or not.

449
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:01,598
Is it very important?
He has taken away my purse.

450
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,596
Isn't this your purse?

451
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:04,595
He has taken the cash and
ran away...Is it enough?

452
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,271
Is there no policeman or
a police station here?

453
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:10,441
Railway station itself is submerged.
-Yes, how can a police station exist?!

454
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:13,110
l think, it's in that corner.
-Sir, please...

455
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,280
Don't touch my bag.

456
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:17,277
Wait...

457
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:20,546
He's from this town.
He'll bring the bag safely.

458
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:21,878
How do you know that
he's not a thief?

459
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:24,783
Sir, I’m not a thief.
I’m an old friend of comrade.

460
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,319
He's my friend, Misro.
This is Aras. -I’m sorry...

461
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:29,960
Without knowing that you're a Tamilian,
l mistook you for a thief.

462
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:33,026
It’s alright, I feel sorry that you
lost your money in our town.

463
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:34,298
I’m very sorry.
-No problem.

464
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:35,796
Credit card is left. Thank God!.

465
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:36,797
That bag...

466
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:37,798
That bag...

467
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,301
Wait...Let it be there itself.
We'll go and take it.

468
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:41,631
You go...We'll bring this bag...

469
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,809
This bag? -We'll bring this bag....
-Don't laugh man.

470
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:45,672
It didn't happen like that.

471
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,105
I’ve never seen thieves...

472
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:50,008
Are we friendly with thieves
and running their association?

473
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:55,215
lf you had asked in the hotel, they
would've told you that there's no train.

474
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,216
At least you could've asked me...

475
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:58,321
Was I so soundly asleep that
you couldn't wake me up?

476
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:00,224
I would've not got this bag,
if he wasn't there.

477
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:03,223
It’s nothing. Why are you making
it into a big issue?

478
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:04,391
Sir, it's a big thing.

479
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,393
Guess how much money
I’ve in this bag?

480
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,063
Sir, I don't know, but I know
how much money I had.

481
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:10,734
Rs.4000. He has stolen it.

482
00:26:10,935 --> 00:26:12,402
At least he left the credit cards.
Thank god!.

483
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:15,164
I have Rs.32 lakhs in this bag.

484
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,532
It’s true, sir.You tell him.

485
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:22,076
In Orissa, 100 Tamilians
died when the dam broke.

486
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,575
He argued in the court with the
help of our Union.

487
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,751
Only now, he got the compensation.

488
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:28,745
Now, he's going to hand over
the check.

489
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,578
It’s very rare to see such a person.
-Tell me the details.

490
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:36,756
I didn't argue, the lawyer won the case.

491
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,092
I’m just a messenger to
hand over the check.

492
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:42,099
But, if Mr. Misro was not there
it would've taken one more year.

493
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,426
Without knowing the Oriya language...

494
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:48,665
Oh God! Look where the car is!

495
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:51,637
It would've been thrown up there
by the floods. Let's go.

496
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:58,673
That bloody man was responsible
for this...Sister ****.

497
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:00,612
Do you know him?
-No, let's go...

498
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:03,788
Do you've any sisters?
-No...

499
00:27:03,988 --> 00:27:05,182
Then, don't worry. Keep going.

500
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,358
Don't use bad words.
Why are you abusing him?

501
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,026
What're you saying?

502
00:27:09,994 --> 00:27:11,757
He doesn't have any sisters.

503
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,529
He's assuming wrongly that you do.

504
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:16,401
Technically wrong.
-Yeah, very funny?

505
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,665
Technical aspects? Don't laugh!
It's insulting.

506
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:20,803
Yes, your city is very bad.

507
00:27:21,005 --> 00:27:21,972
We don't know what they're
bad mouthing.

508
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:25,472
From here, if we go to Andhra and
go straight to Tamil Nadu.

509
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:26,609
We can at least understand
their bad mouthing.

510
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:28,212
It’s very funny.Very funny.

511
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:31,109
I’ve Rs.15 and you've Rs.5.
How can we go with this amount?

512
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,648
Till Orissa border...
-We can go by bus.

513
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:35,480
Sir, how can we go with this
meagre amount?

514
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,385
We'll get a seat for this money also.
Come on.

515
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,385
Sir, the man next to me is
chewing tobacco.

516
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:48,291
Ask him to either chew tobacco or
play the flute. -Why?

517
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,058
I’m getting wet in the shower of his
tobacco mixed spittle...

518
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,202
It’s very unhygienic.

519
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,473
You should be one of the crowd
in a public place.

520
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,971
You'll want make adjustments
by remote control.

521
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,474
This is world not a T.V. set.
-I know the world.

522
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:01,235
l know people.

523
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,641
Don't try to teach me everything.

524
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,714
I’ve traveled a lot.
I’m very friendly also.

525
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,317
Hi! Aras here!

526
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,747
Are you okay? See...

527
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,649
Will you eat this?
-Oh thank you.

528
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:19,693
Ask him not to eat.
-Don't eat it.

529
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:21,131
What?

530
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,128
I’ve eaten in North Indian road
side eateries. No problem.

531
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:26,564
I’ve got a very good immune system.

532
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:28,033
And my health is also very good.

533
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:29,839
Do you have one more?

534
00:28:32,443 --> 00:28:35,241
Don't eat one more, if you eat
you'll go crazy.

535
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,343
Mata...? -Yes, mata (forehead).

536
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,809
"Mata' means "Mother'.
Is he scolding me?

537
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:43,313
He'll feel dizzy. -He means that,
you'll faint and fall down.

538
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,656
Lie! You don't know Oriya, do you?

539
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:48,826
I don't know Oriya, but I
know about that drug...

540
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:54,661
Drug? You mean a narcotic or something?

541
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,663
It’s a ball made out of cannabis paste.

542
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:01,963
What'll happen if I eat this?

543
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:04,164
After eating it, you'll walk
on all fours.

544
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:18,045
Yela Machi Machi
Singers: Kamal Haasan & Udit Narayan.
Music: Vidhyasagar Lyrics: Vairamuthu

545
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:50,144
Buddy, you've gone crazy
and lost your sense.

546
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:58,226
What happened to me, I feel butterflies
fluttering in my mind.

547
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:02,498
Your kick has gone up
like American Dollars.

548
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:06,893
Our brains have come down like
Indian rupees.

549
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,663
When we get a kick...

550
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:10,670
"Knowledge gets increased'.

551
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:15,503
After the kick comes down, knowledge
gained will decrease.

552
00:30:51,215 --> 00:30:59,384
We should've some kick in life.
Or else, we won't have strength.

553
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:03,624
Mother's milk as well as liquor,
both give us kick.

554
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:08,225
You're not clever enough to
differentiate between them.

555
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,399
Mother's milk gives the kick
only for few months.

556
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:16,832
But, the kick of liquor will
remain for our entire life.

557
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:20,566
Kick may change...
Will your mind change?

558
00:31:21,612 --> 00:31:25,912
Can a dog's tail ever be straightened?

559
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:52,875
My chicken are gone...
My hen...hen...

560
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:53,543
What?

561
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:54,644
Hen.

562
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,640
I’ve a credit card.
-No, I want money.

563
00:31:58,816 --> 00:31:59,612
What do you want?

564
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,790
Life is a treasure trove,
the strongest will take it.

565
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:17,263
Is it wrong to be selfish?

566
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:22,462
Don't usurp his livelihood.

567
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,970
lf a worker sleeps with an empty stomach,
this country will ruin.

568
00:32:27,678 --> 00:32:35,551
You're an excellent debater.
You seem to be a lawyer's relative?

569
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:39,312
You're mesmerizing me
with your words.

570
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:43,816
You're selling ice-cubes
in the Himalayas.

571
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:10,350
Sit down... sit down...

572
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:14,355
Hey, sit down...Sit down
Look there.

573
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:29,095
Stop the bus! Stay put there.
-Right..right..

574
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,041
Be careful....Slowly.

575
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,537
Oh God! He got hurt
in the stomach.

576
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:39,140
Do you've stomach-ache?
-No, I’m feeling hungry.

577
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,321
What's this? You've ordered
so many items.

578
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,494
Have you got any hidden money?

579
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:54,957
I’ve got all the credit cards.

580
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,191
In India, we can eat
anything, anywhere.

581
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:59,727
It’s not accepted just in your bus.

582
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:04,805
After eating, what our friend
gave me in the bus...

583
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,268
Do you accept Credit cards here?

584
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:07,978
What's that?

585
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:08,804
Sweet?

586
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:13,206
He's unaware of credit cards. Wants to
know if it’s a sweet of some kind.

587
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:16,152
Shall we inform him?

588
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:20,552
No. Poor guy just became sober
and is happily eating. Let him eat.

589
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:22,488
Cash?

590
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:25,822
Nothing.You do one thing…

591
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:31,093
..just keep eating.
I’ll go finish some work.

592
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:40,336
I don't know why, laughter and
hunger keep alternating.

593
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:52,685
Your bill..

594
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:55,525
Sorry!

595
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,321
What's this?

596
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:01,529
Pay in cash.

597
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:03,066
What?

598
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,794
It seems, he won't accept credit card?
Money...He wants cash payment.

599
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,196
You should've told me earlier!

600
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,730
Excuse me, no cash, only card.

601
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:14,036
I won't accept all that.
No money, you're not leaving this place.

602
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:14,711
What did he say?

603
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:16,379
He said he won't allow you to go
without getting the cash.

604
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:18,879
Whom are you shouting at?
Why won’t you let me leave?

605
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,049
I don't want all that.
I need my money in cash.

606
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:24,221
No! Why didn't you display a board
saying “Credit card not accepted”?

607
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:24,888
Without paying the bill,
I won’t allow you to go out.

608
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:26,613
What're you talking about?
Cash...cash.. What cash? I’ll bash you up.

609
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:29,358
Cash... cash...

610
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,054
Give cash... cash..

611
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:34,223
Look...cash...

612
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:35,361
Thank you, Mr. Sivam.

613
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,396
How much do I owe you?

614
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:37,898
You don't owe me anything.
Here, take this.

615
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:40,070
What's this?
How did you get money?

616
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:42,739
We'll talk about it outside
Come on....

617
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:44,136
Thank you, Mr. Sivam.

618
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:45,238
I won't forget this.

619
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:49,170
My shoe...Sir, my shoes are missing.

620
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:50,914
Sir, my shoe...
My shoes are missing.

621
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:51,581
They've stolen my shoes...

622
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:53,579
What type of a hotel is this?
I’m going to call the police.

623
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:54,751
That's what, I mean...
My shoes are missing.

624
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,249
Sir, don't shout...
Don't shout...-What is it?

625
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:57,651
You've eaten, haven't you?

626
00:35:58,122 --> 00:35:59,419
It was your shoes that you ate.

627
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:01,254
This is the balance.

628
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:10,763
Thank you. -Okay.

629
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:14,495
Wonderful.

630
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:15,669
Wow! Excellent.

631
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:19,773
I’m walking with bare foot like an idiot..

632
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:22,775
Are you a great army officer that
you're polishing your shoes?

633
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:24,948
Not polishing. I’m washing them.

634
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:25,615
Wash!

635
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:28,782
Sir, wait...Wait....

636
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:34,388
Italian designer shoe.

637
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:35,959
They were worth Rs.10,000.

638
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:38,462
Hereafter, we both have to
walk without shoes.

639
00:36:38,929 --> 00:36:41,796
Listen man, don't you ever
touch my things again, okay?

640
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,470
Don’t be so dramatic.

641
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:48,134
Did your break your leg into 2
just by my touch?

642
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:49,563
Sir, wait!

643
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,542
One of my legs became shorter
in an accident I was in.

644
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:56,468
It’s not just your shoes…
Mine are designer shoes too!

645
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:59,309
Yours is Italian. But, mine too was
designed in a hospital.

646
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:01,485
Thank you Mr. Misro.
I’m really sorry, Mr. Sivam.

647
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:02,978
I lost my cool. Thanks.

648
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:05,986
Thank you Mr. Misro.
I’m really sorry, Mr. Sivam.

649
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,817
Okay, stop holding them like that,
like Bharat (from Ramayan)!

650
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:08,650
Sorry, Mr. Misro.

651
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:10,717
Why are you apologizing to me?
-He's right.

652
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:14,665
Sir, I’m in a confused state.

653
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:18,392
Will any fool go to Bhubaneswar to see
location on the eve of his marriage?

654
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,496
Who's that fool?
And who's getting married?

655
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:23,674
Sir, I’m the fool...I’m the one
who's going to get married.

656
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:24,738
Wow! Really?

657
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:26,007
Congratulations!

658
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,734
Why all this? Let's see whether it
goes through...Don't worry.

659
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:30,271
Comrade will take you safely
to your place.

660
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:34,173
Go straight and turn left and catch the
Coromandel express, you'll reach Chennai.

661
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:35,850
Straight to Chennai in 1 7 hours.

662
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,518
Where are you going? -My place is
nearby. I’ll take leave.

663
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:40,918
Bye! bye Comrade!
-Okay, bye!

664
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:44,027
Where are you going?
-I’m not going anywhere.

665
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:45,862
Don't forget your shoes...

666
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:48,031
Can I forget them? I’ll first wear
socks and then put them on..

667
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:52,202
You wear your shoes and I’ll wear mine.
...Then, we'll go together.

668
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:56,036
We'll go...but if you
wear my shoes...

669
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:57,874
Do you mean that we should
wear one each?

670
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:02,379
Wow! You're smiling!

671
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,046
Sorry sir.

672
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:05,374
I didn't appreciate your
joke because I was in tension...

673
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,710
Not only that…. after
taking that cannabis.

674
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:11,046
I feel like crying when
I hear jokes.

675
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:11,880
Yes.

676
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:16,389
Okay, you put on your shoes.

677
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:19,563
I’ve another pair. I’ll wear that.
Then, we'll go together.

678
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:23,896
Sir, Is there any train
to Chennai from here?

679
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:25,227
Coromandel Express may arrive.

680
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:26,095
Will it stop here?

681
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:27,062
It has to!

682
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:29,900
How long will it stop?

683
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:34,839
No..no sir! How long will the
Coromandel train stop here?

684
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,248
No..no.. please stop joking.
Please tell me.

685
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:43,910
How long will the Coromandel train
stop here?

686
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,357
I’ve understood.
-What?

687
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:53,824
Oh come on man!

688
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,429
From 1:58 to 2:02

689
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:57,658
2 to 2 to 2:02.

690
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:00,165
Oh 2 to 2 to ....

691
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,432
He can't get it.
Explain to him.

692
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,437
Is that so?
-I got it.

693
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:07,940
Listen! Are you sure
the train will come?

694
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:09,906
Okay! Are you sure it'll come?

695
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:11,136
Who can give surety?

696
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,842
Sir, I’ve a question.
-Go ahead...

697
00:39:14,084 --> 00:39:15,711
Do you've a telephone?

698
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:16,953
I too want to ask him one thing.

699
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:17,813
Excuse me... please..

700
00:39:18,722 --> 00:39:19,780
Is there a phone I can use?

701
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,787
Wait, he asked first.

702
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,783
Yes sir, there's a telephone.

703
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:28,222
Okay, can I make a phone call?
-Please.. please, let me go first.

704
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,797
Sir, I’ve to make this really important
personal phone call.

705
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,733
You two decide between you two.

706
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:34,971
Why?

707
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:36,365
One phone, one call...

708
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:39,072
But why? -Because I’m the
station master, that's why.

709
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:41,470
What's your name?
-Sivam

710
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:42,740
What's your name?

711
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:43,479
Jesus Christ!

712
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:44,147
Mr. Christ,

713
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:47,745
You go and make a call...go...

714
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:50,517
You go and make a phone call.
-Thank you.

715
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:57,327
I’ve the key.
Where is he going?

716
00:39:58,729 --> 00:39:59,457
You seem to be happy.

717
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:02,461
Are you married?
-Yeah?

718
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,390
Mr. Christ, wait.

719
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:27,520
What?

720
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:38,624
Thank you and sorry.

721
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:41,029
What for?

722
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:44,871
Station master said only one
phone call can be made.

723
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:46,542
And I’ve made it.

724
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:48,037
You can try another.

725
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:51,980
I’m not in a hurry. It’s just to inform
them that I’m on my way.

726
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,214
But your case is different.

727
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:55,710
Emergency.

728
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:57,721
It’s about love.

729
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:05,126
How did you know?
-I can read your eyes.

730
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:09,733
Are you so experienced?

731
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:13,736
Why not? Shouldn't I’ve had the
experience of falling in love?

732
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:15,397
Sure.

733
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,242
But you? Falling in love?

734
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:21,844
Why not?

735
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:23,238
Of course!

736
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:23,913
Definitely.

737
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:27,242
I mean, every dog has it's day.

738
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:30,079
...and they say love is blind...so..

739
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:35,918
Sorry.. That came out bad.

740
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:37,218
I’m sorry, I didn't mean that.

741
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:43,763
When did you first meet?

742
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:45,492
You mean the dog?

743
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:51,107
Where did you first meet
your girl?

744
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:57,277
In the middle of the street
with my music band.

745
00:41:59,149 --> 00:41:59,774
Let me guess.

746
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:02,114
In a temple festival?

747
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:05,117
In a marriage procession?

748
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:07,449
What were you doing?

749
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:11,620
I was spreading a message.

750
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:14,054
Oh, so you were a postman?

751
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:17,467
Messenger service?

752
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:24,300
You could say that too.
Even Jesus Christ was a messenger.

753
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:26,673
Can't you ever say something
in a straight-forward way?

754
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:28,974
Yep, I do. -What?

755
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,305
Messages!

756
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:33,475
Right! So...

757
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:37,078
What might that great
message be?

758
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:51,358
Nattukkoru Seithi Solli
Singers: Kamal Haasan, Chandran & Malathi.
Music: Vidhyasagar Lyrics: Vairamuthu

759
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:10,047
A modern Jester has come
to spread a message.

760
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:16,953
I’m here to narrate a story beautifully
laced with songs and dances.

761
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:23,689
I’m here to narrate our
pains and struggle.

762
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:27,126
Listen to the story of 910.

763
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:30,630
Listen to the travails
of the workers.

764
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:43,151
All men and women, brothers and
sisters, listen to this.

765
00:43:43,353 --> 00:43:46,413
Let's unmask the truth.
It’ll lead us into trouble.

766
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:49,988
We die and live everyday.
Our heads roll down everyday.

767
00:43:50,994 --> 00:43:53,485
Gentlemen, in the beginning
of this story.

768
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:56,825
Our hero is a worker.
A Rs.910 salaried man.

769
00:43:57,201 --> 00:44:01,831
When his co-workers were agitating for
salary hike near factory gate.

770
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:05,300
Dodging them, he slips out silently.

771
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:06,839
Where is he going?

772
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:09,342
Will the job come good if you
question while going for it?

773
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:13,348
He is going to ogle at girls.

774
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:16,846
He is going in search of
his lover.

775
00:44:24,661 --> 00:44:27,357
Adding glitter to her golden looks,
she's charming him.

776
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:30,666
Your eyes are filling up the
void in my life.

777
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:43,710
The town bus is going empty,
let's go happily to a movie in that.

778
00:44:54,424 --> 00:44:57,359
Your take home salary
is just Rs.910.

779
00:44:57,594 --> 00:45:00,722
How will you bear the
burden of a family?

780
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,792
It seems to be a street play.
A play in the middle of the street!

781
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:07,899
Getting wisdom from his love
...Our story's hero...

782
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:12,737
Also jumps into the
arena of struggle.

783
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:18,406
There is a Law for minimum wages.

784
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:21,846
There is a plan not to reduce
even a penny from it.

785
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:25,016
Though there're umpteen
number of laws.

786
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:28,089
Some still manage to pay
meager salaries.

787
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,324
They'll eat the poor alive.

788
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:35,328
Who's that noble man cheating workers
and paying low salaries?

789
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:37,022
Look, he's over there.

790
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:58,386
Let's praise the mercy of God
and hail him.

791
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:02,454
Long live the man in whites.

792
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:06,125
Long live upcoming lndustrialist.

793
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:09,861
Long live Multi Business Tycoon.

794
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:13,264
Long live Business Magnet.

795
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,769
What do you mean by business magnet?

796
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:18,141
Business magnet.

797
00:46:18,508 --> 00:46:19,600
Rap on his head.

798
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:22,137
Long live our leader.

799
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:26,976
We'll sing paeans hailing
your long life.

800
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:34,314
Ours is a blessing heart.
We'll always sing your praise.

801
00:46:40,163 --> 00:46:41,630
Wow! He's very good.

802
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:43,992
Madam, they're criticizing
your father.

803
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,931
White dress, white beard.
Stopped short of mentioning his name.

804
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,840
Go and find out, what's it?

805
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:55,204
It seems, they want a hike.

806
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:58,013
Hm?.

807
00:46:58,215 --> 00:47:00,513
It seems, they want a
hike in their salaries.

808
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:06,851
I can only give Rs.910.

809
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:12,025
It’s impossible to raise
even a penny.

810
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:14,094
How are you going to
manage them, boss?

811
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:25,707
I’ve planned a venture.

812
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:33,207
Our problems will be resolved
in the near future.

813
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:40,046
It’s a good news...At this juncture...
-Ask them, will they give way or not?

814
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:50,398
Joint ventures with
Multi National Companies. Joint venture!

815
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:54,566
They'll send raw materials
from their country.

816
00:47:55,238 --> 00:47:56,068
We'll import.

817
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:59,241
We're refining here.
We're packing it here.

818
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:03,071
We're planning and marketing.

819
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:05,915
We'll get thrashed
if we fail to market it.

820
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:08,250
What're we going to import?

821
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:11,419
Tea!

822
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:14,590
Tea.

823
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,453
What?

824
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:17,423
Tea.

825
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:23,726
Hello Commissioner uncle...
-That's okay...That's okay.

826
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:25,763
What's the margin of profit?

827
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:27,696
Only this!?

828
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:32,497
MNC people will give you crumbs.

829
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:35,077
40%   to us.

830
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:36,438
60%   to him.

831
00:48:36,646 --> 00:48:39,342
Then, what about the plight of
local tea producers?

832
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:41,344
Let them to go the hell!
Who's bothered?

833
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:43,945
For us, our foreign investors
are more important.

834
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,346
The profit we get in the
process is more important.

835
00:48:46,656 --> 00:48:49,352
In a game of chess, as proprietors
make their move.

836
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:51,752
Will worker remain a mute spectator?

837
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:53,360
Or keep watching the fun silently?

838
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:57,533
Even if shore wants to rest,
waves will never allow it.

839
00:48:57,734 --> 00:49:01,636
Even if trees want to take rest,
wind will not allow it.

840
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:07,208
Even if you run away and hide,
life will not leave you alone.

841
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,677
With a remote control
from somewhere.

842
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,154
He's playing havoc with
this country.

843
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:24,319
Where's the remote control?

844
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:31,323
To remote control us, there're people
in America, England, France and Germany.

845
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:34,664
We're not alone, we're a group.

846
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:37,031
I’ll take them to task.

847
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:43,377
Driver, let's go.

848
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:47,147
Our need now is a good decision.
Not just for this play.

849
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,644
For everyone.

850
00:49:48,885 --> 00:49:52,480
Efforts from our side only
will not bring that.

851
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:57,484
Me, you, he, that man, this man.

852
00:49:57,694 --> 00:50:01,528
Look there, the person who's blaring
horn and disturbing our play.

853
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:03,661
We all must join together.

854
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:05,158
...And decide unitedly.

855
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:24,178
We'll sing a new song. That'll accompany
us on a long journey.

856
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:37,523
Our song is not a lone voice, but a
vociferous war cry of the downtrodden lot.

857
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:44,196
A song that'll usher in a new era.

858
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:11,057
Our difficulties are same. Come and join
the voice of protest courageously.

859
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:16,970
Raise like a wave in protest.
Teach them weakness is not our character.

860
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:23,977
Make a move, don't restrict
to yourself.

861
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:30,114
It’s good.

862
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:33,181
An arrogant heroine,
revolutionary hero.

863
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:34,846
Nice story.

864
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:37,788
It’s new! -It’s not a story.
It’s my life.

865
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:39,358
Yes, it's your life.

866
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:44,462
As you think, Bala is not
an arrogant girl.

867
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:45,424
Excuse me!

868
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:47,597
It’s okay, you didn't mean it.

869
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:51,374
Even I came to the same conclusion
when I first saw her.

870
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:53,208
Only when I met her, the second time.

871
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:56,603
Do you know where I met her the
second time? Myself and Mehr.

872
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:19,561
Be careful, boy.

873
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:22,397
You be careful lady.
-Lady?

874
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:24,267
If I’m a boy because I’m wearing
a pair of trousers,

875
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:25,569
You're a lady because
you're wearing a skirt.

876
00:52:25,775 --> 00:52:28,744
Why're you fighting with the
passersby on the road?

877
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:30,071
That's why, I told you
that I’ll drive.

878
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,907
Why don't you just admit that with
your big "handle-bar" mustache...

879
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:33,742
..you feel embarrassed to be
driven by a woman?

880
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:36,248
Hey, did I say that?
-Come on, admit it.

881
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:38,421
Why're you beating around the bush?
You drive.

882
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:40,590
Nothing like that.

883
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:44,418
Hey! Are you blind?

884
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,260
Oh God! He has stopped the car
and is coming back.

885
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:50,797
Definitely, it must be an M.L.A's car.
We're going to get beaten up.

886
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:55,995
I’m very sorry, sir.
-Nalla

887
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:59,768
Madan sir, you painted a cartoon on me.
Autograph, please. -I’m terribly sorry.

888
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:01,102
You said that already.

889
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:04,279
He is Mr. Madan. She is Meher.
She's in our troupe.

890
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:05,778
She's also an architect.

891
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:07,108
Oh!...That gentleman?

892
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:09,118
Hey, what man..

893
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:14,347
What's your plan for dinner?
-At home.

894
00:53:14,824 --> 00:53:16,883
Look, we're talking amongst ourselves.

895
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:17,626
Go on, then!

896
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:20,963
Too much water everywhere!

897
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:23,625
Tamil Nadu wouldn't quite be
what it is without all these people!

898
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:24,629
Okay. Let's go!

899
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:26,301
Where? -To dine.

900
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:28,963
My dress is soiled.
-Then, I’ll also stand here.

901
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:31,140
Driver, splash some on me too.
-No sir.

902
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:33,309
Then what? Come with me.

903
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:35,705
But where?
-Suspense!

904
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:37,476
But, the food will be delicious.

905
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:43,318
Greetings sir.

906
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,385
Are the dogs chained?
-Yes, they are.

907
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:47,849
Shut up, Tommy!

908
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:52,828
Hello Bala, how are you?
-Fine.

909
00:53:53,129 --> 00:53:53,823
This is my aunt.

910
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:54,496
Greetings.

911
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:55,929
Yes.. yes! Come.

912
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:57,325
Let me introduce you to my friends.

913
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:58,159
Hello. -Thank you!

914
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,837
This is Felix. -Hello, Mr. Madan.
This is Manohar.

915
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:07,506
Uncle, check whether the dinner
is ready or not? -Okay!

916
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:14,942
Why're they here?
-You wait.

917
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:16,352
He's inside.

918
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:19,320
You don't want them, do you?
-Yeah..

919
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:22,949
Stop.

920
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:24,951
Why're you here?
Whom do you want to meet?

921
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:26,692
Cartoonist Madan invited us here.

922
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:28,693
There is no one like that.
Get out! Get out!

923
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:30,525
Sir, he invited us.

924
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:33,365
They're my guests.

925
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:36,539
Oh, your guests? Welcome, come in.
...Greetings.

926
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:37,362
Come on, Nalla.

927
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:44,876
Nalla, you were following me.
Why were you late?

928
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:47,709
You came luxuriously in a car.
We came by a two wheeler.

929
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:49,214
As it is, there are too many
dogs in this house.

930
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,217
Ask everyone to come
for dinner.

931
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:53,378
Excuse me!

932
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:56,058
Come, let's have dinner,
baby's waiting for us.

933
00:54:56,893 --> 00:54:59,225
Hello Mr. Madan.
-Hello Mr. Ranjit.

934
00:54:59,429 --> 00:54:59,895
One minute!

935
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:02,926
Excuse me, Ladies and Gentlemen!

936
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,936
I would like you to meet my father
Mr. Kandasamy Padayachi.

937
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:12,530
You've come to the lion's den and
how dare to twist your whiskers?

938
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:16,944
I’m just thinking about Mr. Padayachi
dancing to our local folk beat.

939
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:35,290
And that's my father,
Kandasamy Padayachi.

940
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:38,467
Greetings. Greetings to everyone.

941
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:41,898
Who's she?

942
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:44,465
She's with me.

943
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:48,072
Sorry, I’m...
-Her name is Mehrunnisa

944
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:51,571
All religions are equal in my house.
What do you say? -Yes.

945
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,476
Hail Lord Siva's mercy.

946
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,049
Father, he's Mr. Madan.

947
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,385
Welcome.

948
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:01,657
Since morning, Bala was anxiously
awaiting your arrival.

949
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,486
Boss, the one who's wearing green
shirt is Mr. Madan.

950
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:05,820
Don't I know that?

951
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:10,822
Hello Madan sir. I’m busy with
my business all the time.

952
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,059
I can't remember faces.

953
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:16,334
You've grown beard all of a sudden.
That's why I couldn't. -Oh God!

954
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:19,341
Since when you started sporting beard?
-I was always with a beard.

955
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:20,509
It looks good.

956
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:24,677
Look, don't be in a hurry
to catch the train.

957
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:27,679
The train won't start until
you board the train. I will take care of that!

958
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,852
Relax and enjoy your feast.

959
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,521
Okay Mr. Madan, see you.
-Won't you join us in the feast?

960
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,691
Hail Lord Siva!
-Boss is on a fast today.

961
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,689
No water too.
You carry on.

962
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,885
Dear, take care of him.
-Okay...

963
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:42,955
Nobody introduced me.

964
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:46,729
He's my father-in-law. -Greetings.
-Retired Magistrate.

965
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,201
Did you eat? -No.

966
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:51,503
Here's the dish you prepared.

967
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:54,002
Bring the other dishes.
Come on, bring them.

968
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:56,537
Oh my God!

969
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:02,040
What have you done Grandpa?
-Someone please come and clean it fast.

970
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:05,050
It's okay, just move over.-Sorry!

971
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:06,555
Forgive me.

972
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,383
It’s alright, Grandpa.
It’s alright.

973
00:57:09,158 --> 00:57:10,090
I’m so sorry!

974
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,060
Don't worry. Accidents happen...

975
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,388
I was talking to him.

976
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,461
It’s alright. Why do you get upset
for such trivial things?

977
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:16,891
Nalla, come here.

978
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,568
Look, she has put a painting
on the dining table.

979
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:20,394
No, Madan sir.

980
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:22,571
She doesn't agree. The painting
is only visible to us.

981
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:23,739
Even we can see that.

982
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:24,406
Oh sorry.

983
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,905
What do you see? This's a fish and
that's a horse.

984
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:31,240
What do you see?
-I see many things, sir.

985
00:57:31,447 --> 00:57:33,278
I think, Nalla is getting
into the mood.

986
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:34,412
Come on, Nalla.

987
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:00,475
Beautiful!

988
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:03,145
What can we do with the goat?
-We can only make soup out of it.

989
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:06,779
Please accept this cup.

990
00:58:08,217 --> 00:58:11,311
Wow, that's great piece
of improvisation.

991
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:14,020
Can I take a photograph of that?
-Why not?

992
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,818
Okay, you want more height?

993
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:20,158
You need more height.
-Yes...yes.

994
00:58:23,866 --> 00:58:25,663
Come on, show your skills
on the computer.

995
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:28,503
Thank you!

996
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:39,011
Wow! Beautiful! -Lights off.

997
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:50,982
It’s nice.

998
00:58:54,897 --> 00:58:57,422
Where is the bathroom?
-This side.

999
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:03,698
What do you want me to do?
Rs. 910 is a good salary.

1000
00:59:03,906 --> 00:59:05,703
That's why I’m telling you to increase
the salary by Rs. 100.

1001
00:59:05,908 --> 00:59:07,205
They'll keep quiet for the
next 2 years.

1002
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:10,041
If we keep on revising their pay...

1003
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:12,714
In the future, our grandchildren
won't remain rich.

1004
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:13,981
They'll become workers.

1005
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:16,878
l mean to say that if we don't increase
their salaries, they'll strike work.

1006
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:20,886
What can they do? We'll announce the
lock out ahead of them.

1007
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:23,715
But, that's our arrow of
supernatural strength.

1008
00:59:24,927 --> 00:59:26,053
We've to keep it a secret.

1009
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:29,390
Will Govt. let us announce lock out?
They'll support only workers.

1010
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:32,394
No Mudaliar, they'll pretend as
if they're supporting them.

1011
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:34,728
Who's offering them foreign exchange?
It’s us, isn't it?

1012
00:59:34,937 --> 00:59:36,234
Do workers give them?

1013
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:38,907
Can you guarantee us that Govt.
will not create any problem?

1014
00:59:39,108 --> 00:59:39,733
Why not?

1015
00:59:39,942 --> 00:59:42,240
We can go in for a one time settlement
with the politicians.

1016
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:44,072
But, we can't manage them
with monthly doles.

1017
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,578
Government will declare
this strike as illegal.

1018
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:47,579
l stand guarantee for that.

1019
00:59:48,484 --> 00:59:53,251
Till I’m gone, workers' salary will
remain Rs. 910 only.

1020
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:55,250
I’ll not raise even a penny.

1021
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:56,755
Even you people shouldn't raise it.

1022
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:58,594
What's the noise there?

1023
00:59:58,961 --> 01:00:01,589
Nothing. Your daughter is hosting
a party for artists downstairs.

1024
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:02,924
Somebody amongst them would've
raised the noise.

1025
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:04,099
What's the noise?

1026
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:09,271
Since all doors are alike.

1027
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:11,940
So, I’m stepping in and out of every room,
searching bathroom.

1028
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:13,438
You could've asked me, couldn't you?

1029
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:14,606
Go straight.

1030
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:15,778
No please, I’ve found it.

1031
01:00:15,978 --> 01:00:16,444
Thank you!

1032
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:17,771
Nice books.

1033
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:21,279
Have you read all the books?

1034
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:23,283
Did you think, is it just
for decoration?

1035
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:25,621
l may look stupid, but I’m not.

1036
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:27,780
No, I didn't mean like that.

1037
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:28,919
I’m terribly sorry.

1038
01:00:30,493 --> 01:00:34,452
I want to tell you something
but I don't know how to begin.

1039
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:36,463
Can't you help me?

1040
01:00:36,999 --> 01:00:39,297
How can I help you without
knowing what it is?

1041
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:43,630
I’m going to say ''sorry''.
But I've never had to say it before.

1042
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:47,138
Oh! What for?
-For everything.

1043
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:49,811
For what happened that day on
the street and what happened today here.

1044
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:50,645
Sorry.

1045
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:54,646
If I don't say sorry at least once,
I can't remain in peace.

1046
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:56,148
But you've apologized many times now.

1047
01:00:58,855 --> 01:01:00,322
You must do me a favor.

1048
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:02,491
Tell me. -Not just one, but two.

1049
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:05,820
First, you have to step into my studio.

1050
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:09,324
What's this like legendary Ahalya?
Where's your studio?

1051
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:11,500
Here...Please come.

1052
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:14,661
This is my studio.

1053
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:17,172
I’ve stepped in.

1054
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:18,101
Favor number two.

1055
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:20,168
You must paint a portrait for me.

1056
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:22,173
Not on the computer but
on canvas.

1057
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:29,178
Anything which recently attracted
or touched you.

1058
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:31,182
Even a sketch will do.

1059
01:01:31,687 --> 01:01:32,153
Please...

1060
01:01:32,688 --> 01:01:34,986
I’m not a girl who doesn't
respect artists.

1061
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:39,489
It's true that I am rich girl.
But please don't think I am proud.

1062
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,989
I’m not like my father.
I’m more like my mother.

1063
01:01:42,431 --> 01:01:43,489
Comrade, sorry.

1064
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,497
I must go back home only
after dropping you.

1065
01:01:45,701 --> 01:01:47,328
It’s raining...and the roads
are uneven, as you know.

1066
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:48,162
As it is, I have a two-wheeler.

1067
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:51,829
I’ll come now.
-I’ll wait downstairs.

1068
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:52,507
Yeah... yeah...

1069
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:57,035
Good night.

1070
01:01:58,281 --> 01:01:59,509
What about the wish?

1071
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:21,893
Good night.

1072
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:38,879
Nothing wrong in this.

1073
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:41,315
We can send a weakling to spoil
the plan of mighty.

1074
01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:43,651
For the welfare of many workers...
What's wrong in this, Comrade?

1075
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:44,984
My opinion says it's wrong.

1076
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:48,660
We're now discussing about how to
manage the lock out problem.

1077
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:49,832
So, we'll think about a way out.

1078
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:53,160
Instead of doing that, it isn't our duty
to play tricks like a jackal.

1079
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:54,836
Let's live like lions, Comrade.

1080
01:02:55,204 --> 01:02:58,833
What's wrong in dealing with it
wisely, Comrade?

1081
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:02,177
I’m not a politician to do
anything in the guise of being smart.

1082
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:07,510
Hello, oh God, wrong number!
Hang up the phone.

1083
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:10,015
It’s wrong number, Comrade.
-Even, I’m saying that.

1084
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:15,182
Bala is an honest girl. I’ll not let
you people use her as a means.

1085
01:03:15,424 --> 01:03:18,188
Oh! Is that so? Reached that far?
-Why do you also talk like that?

1086
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:21,526
There's no limit for Anbu(affection).

1087
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:27,692
No...this seems like another 2
syllable word(love).

1088
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,368
Hey...don't!

1089
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:36,541
We need to talk about funds
for the street play festival.

1090
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:37,644
Let's discuss that.

1091
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:41,342
An idea! Shall we ask any soft drink
company to sponsor us?

1092
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:45,721
Very nice! Then, why do
you hold red flags?

1093
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:47,214
You could hold the white flags.

1094
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:48,889
Why keep talking about expenses?

1095
01:03:49,091 --> 01:03:50,888
They're not going to ask for
a 5 star hotel comforts?

1096
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:52,219
Why would they?

1097
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:54,726
If Nalla says so, they'll have a few
idlis and and sleep on the Verandah.

1098
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:57,559
Okay, Verandah is ready.
We can't even afford those idlis.

1099
01:03:57,767 --> 01:04:01,567
Look, there may be about 200 people.
If we arrange basic amenities...

1100
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:04,069
...how much will it cost?
-Will it cost Rs. 18,000?

1101
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:06,740
I asked whether it will cost Rs. 18,000?

1102
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,409
When did you come, slipping in quietly
like a cat....

1103
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:10,237
Beg your pardon.

1104
01:04:10,446 --> 01:04:11,572
No, no, I’m sorry.

1105
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:13,242
When did you come?

1106
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:16,752
When you certified that Bala
is an honest girl.

1107
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:21,249
Mr.Poun said it isn't Anbu(affection) but
it denotes a different meaning(Love).

1108
01:04:21,457 --> 01:04:23,755
I walked in at that time itself...
Okay, forget it.

1109
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,086
That's our personal matter.

1110
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:30,424
Is Rs. 18,000 enough for you?
-What for?

1111
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:32,935
For your street play festival.

1112
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:37,601
Look, you asked for a
cola sponsor.

1113
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:38,603
Bala sponsor is here.

1114
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:41,936
No, its Nalla sponsored. -How?

1115
01:04:42,144 --> 01:04:43,270
This is your money.

1116
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:47,438
The dining table painting which you
painted in my house that day.

1117
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:49,618
I sold it on the Internet.

1118
01:04:49,852 --> 01:04:50,443
Greetings.

1119
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:55,613
Indian Food company bought that for
Rs. 20,000 to use it in their promos.

1120
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:59,425
Really? -I know, you'll raise
such questions?

1121
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:01,626
That's why, I’ve brought all this.

1122
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:03,966
What's this?
-Receipt.

1123
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:09,303
Sold for 20,000...
You said that, you'll pay us Rs. 18,000.

1124
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:10,472
But, there's a shortfall of Rs. 2000.

1125
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:12,975
Oh! This is a business deal.

1126
01:05:13,175 --> 01:05:15,643
Don't I need a commission of 10%  ?

1127
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:21,139
Business man's daughter, right?
Did I lie?

1128
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:23,642
Okay, forget it man...
Only Rs. 2000 shortfall.

1129
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:26,481
But, we're getting Rs. 18,000. We'll add
color to our drama function.

1130
01:05:27,523 --> 01:05:28,990
Rs.18,000 is just an advance.

1131
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:30,317
You can earn more than this.

1132
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:34,494
lsn't it a great thing to grab money
from here itself for worker's welfare?

1133
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:36,324
Whatever your father has grabbed
from the workers....

1134
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:37,499
...is shinning bright here.

1135
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,167
Logically, I shouldn't have come here.

1136
01:05:39,368 --> 01:05:40,335
Have you started to harp
on the same string?

1137
01:05:40,536 --> 01:05:41,002
Good morning, madam.

1138
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:43,835
Just nod yes to everything my
father says.

1139
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:47,474
What's the point in enacting street
dramas if all I had to say was "yes."

1140
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:49,837
I could've remained as his slave
accepting Rs.910 salary.

1141
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:53,678
Oh! Is talking truth a taboo here?

1142
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:56,351
Don't talk till we get the money.

1143
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:58,348
We're getting money
for a good cause.

1144
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:04,859
Artists shouldn't be sold,
but art can be sold, okay?

1145
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:11,025
Visitors to my office should look at
your portrait and be charmed by it.

1146
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,027
Who should get charmed?

1147
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:18,069
Comedy... don't add such comical streak
to the portrait.

1148
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:19,934
I’ll ensure it. Which style
would you prefer?

1149
01:06:20,342 --> 01:06:24,278
It’s up to baby to decide.
What do I know about art?

1150
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,777
I know only about heart.

1151
01:06:25,981 --> 01:06:28,609
Since it's very pure,
I keep my workers here.

1152
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,285
Use your own inspiration and
paint it well.

1153
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:31,620
But one thing.

1154
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,618
The viewers shouldn't easily understand
the subject of your painting.

1155
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:34,289
Why?

1156
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:35,787
They should understand only
when explained.

1157
01:06:35,991 --> 01:06:37,788
That's modern art, am I right?

1158
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:41,960
Sometimes I do crack jokes.
Don't take it seriously.

1159
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:43,131
Have they come?

1160
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:44,299
They're waiting for about
10 minutes for you.

1161
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,967
Oh Lord Siva!

1162
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:49,960
Why don't we paint Siva here?
It’ll look beautiful, won't it?

1163
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:50,797
Do you mean Lord Siva?

1164
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:52,804
Won't it look like a temple then?

1165
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:56,804
When we say our profession is God.
Then, office is a temple, right? Let it be.

1166
01:06:57,012 --> 01:06:59,310
lf you tell me, when am l
to start working....

1167
01:06:59,582 --> 01:07:01,277
l don't want it to be done during
office working hours.

1168
01:07:01,383 --> 01:07:03,783
Boss, one thing. Tomorrow's Saturday,
followed by Sunday.

1169
01:07:04,019 --> 01:07:06,647
Then, Festival Holidays...
Holidays for 5-6 days.

1170
01:07:07,323 --> 01:07:08,756
You can start tomorrow then.

1171
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:11,756
Don't switch on the AC during holidays
as he's working here.

1172
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:13,087
5 plants will be running wastefully.

1173
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:15,593
You'll get cool sea breeze
if you open the doors.

1174
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:16,765
Even paint will get dried up
quickly, right?

1175
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:19,267
It’ll be correct if
we start now. -Yes.

1176
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:23,598
Okay, Bye. Hail Lord Siva!

1177
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:27,709
Good.

1178
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:28,876
Come.

1179
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:54,860
Poovaasam Purappadum Penne
Singers: Viay Prakash & Sadhana Sargam.
Music: Vidhyasagar Lyrics: Vairamuthu

1180
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:22,353
The scent of flowers is exuded in the air,
when flowers I draw

1181
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:29,202
Oh Love! Even my fingers feel the
warmth of fire when I draw it.

1182
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:33,372
If the lifeless, your touch brings to life

1183
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:37,178
Alive that I am, what shall happen to me?

1184
01:08:37,379 --> 01:08:41,179
But you are the masterpiece that
steals my life

1185
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:43,778
A dot meets another dot and a
painting paints itself

1186
01:09:44,647 --> 01:09:47,616
A heart meets another heart - an epic chances

1187
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:51,109
Every line partakes in the painting

1188
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:54,615
Every tease builds up our love.

1189
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:58,452
To draw the sky,blues suffice

1190
01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:01,789
But what color do you say would
paint our love?

1191
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:06,127
Smudge the blush off my cheeks onto
your fingers and

1192
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:09,964
Come, lets paint our love..

1193
01:11:02,057 --> 01:11:05,356
Where does the life of a painting lie?

1194
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:08,856
It lies in the eyes of the beholder
who looks into its soul

1195
01:11:09,298 --> 01:11:12,699
Where does love lie in a woman?

1196
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:16,032
It lies in a part untouched by the male

1197
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:19,696
You are a superb painter who knows
how to draw,

1198
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:23,537
You are also a sagely artist who knows
the intricacies of woman,

1199
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:27,370
Like the rain drops that cheats the
clouds and falls onto the sweet earth

1200
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:30,711
Come, fall onto my lap....

1201
01:12:19,268 --> 01:12:20,132
Very clever.

1202
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:22,629
Look, he mingled communism
in the corporate office.

1203
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:24,806
Okay, why did you choose to do that?

1204
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:26,975
lf they insist on both Siva
and the ball bearing.

1205
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:28,143
Then, we've to add dolly.

1206
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,975
Look, 910 looks very beautiful
in the falls.

1207
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,304
It’s seen clearly, right?

1208
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:33,139
Won't we know?

1209
01:12:33,348 --> 01:12:35,816
Sickle above the head.
Karl Marx on the side.

1210
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,315
100 marks can be given for that.

1211
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:39,616
That painter painted as
my daughter had told.

1212
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:43,988
l never interfered,
she's very clever.

1213
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:46,161
Be quiet, father. -Very humble!

1214
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:47,458
Then, that is...

1215
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:50,324
Boss, he is a fraud.
-What do you mean?

1216
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:51,157
Please come with me...

1217
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:54,498
Leave me...

1218
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:57,334
Look there, what's falling
down from the falls?

1219
01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:58,506
Water.

1220
01:12:58,707 --> 01:12:59,833
It’s flowing like 910.

1221
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:00,667
Yes.

1222
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,507
Salary which we pay the workers.

1223
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,838
He's ridiculing us.

1224
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:07,174
Look there, can you see Karl Marx?

1225
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,675
Look at the top of Siva's head.

1226
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:10,515
Sickle and the hammer.

1227
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:11,845
Okay, leave it.
Look at Lord Siva.

1228
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:14,352
Can you recognize who that is?
-It’s him.

1229
01:13:16,391 --> 01:13:18,359
l couldn't understand it myself,
how could you?

1230
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,188
When I looked at that
painting intently.

1231
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:25,359
No boss, I overheard when he was
talking to his friends.

1232
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:27,694
It was wrong to let in that
arrogant man.

1233
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:31,031
Yes, our workers came to know about
lock out from him only.

1234
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,037
He was responsible for
the strike notice.

1235
01:13:33,408 --> 01:13:34,875
I thought, that you would
know everything.

1236
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:35,873
Thinking that he's going to
be your future son-in-law.

1237
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,705
Son-in-law? What do you mean?

1238
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:39,538
Don't you know about this?
Okay then, forget it.

1239
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:42,541
How can I forget it?
What're you saying?

1240
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:44,048
Not me but the entire
office is agog.

1241
01:13:44,419 --> 01:13:46,717
Love between them crossed the limits
during the painting.

1242
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:48,549
You had even asked to switch
off the A.C. plant.

1243
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:50,054
It got pretty hot.

1244
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:51,725
Boss, look there....
You can see it yourself...

1245
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:52,890
Did you see?

1246
01:13:53,161 --> 01:13:55,721
We had asked him to paint on the wall
but he has flattered your daughter.

1247
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:58,062
Boss, we shouldn't leave
it so easily.

1248
01:13:58,300 --> 01:13:59,733
We've to nip it at the bud.

1249
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:02,229
Or else, we'll lose honor
in front of workers.

1250
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:21,748
Sir, he has come....
even Madam is with him.

1251
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:28,429
Come.

1252
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:38,439
Good night. -What?
Good night. -Good night.

1253
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:56,619
Boss, Karuna is in the line.

1254
01:14:58,126 --> 01:15:02,256
Hello, Madam has left.
-Okay. Settle the matter silently.

1255
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:04,291
Please wait for a while,
we'll come back now.

1256
01:15:04,499 --> 01:15:06,296
No need, we'll go to the
office on our own.

1257
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:10,093
AC car! They even offered soft drinks.
That's why, we're in a hurry.

1258
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:13,797
Are we not in a hurry?
We can only act on the road.

1259
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:19,110
Scoundrels, you've brought disgrace
to the entire manhood.

1260
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:21,316
You people can't control
your desires...

1261
01:15:21,516 --> 01:15:22,983
What's this, Comrade?

1262
01:15:23,518 --> 01:15:25,486
Thank God, we came by heaven.

1263
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:26,312
Or else, we would've got delayed.

1264
01:15:34,496 --> 01:15:36,088
Oh God! What're you searching?

1265
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:39,565
Nalla has the keys with him.
-Okay, you move on, I’ll get the keys.

1266
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:42,996
Couldn't you get the keys earlier?
I thought I had them with me.

1267
01:15:47,976 --> 01:15:51,002
Hey idiots, you could've done
this in the Union office?

1268
01:15:51,413 --> 01:15:55,509
Even, if we do it in the Union office.
It'll come only now.

1269
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:57,852
You're right, Comrade

1270
01:15:58,053 --> 01:16:00,021
Comrade, people are coming after
you carrying sickles.

1271
01:16:04,559 --> 01:16:06,061
It was this moustached man.

1272
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:08,063
Hey, who're you people?

1273
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:12,159
Go and have tea in the Tea shop.
lf you utter a word, I’ll kill you.

1274
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,700
Tomorrow his corpse will be
floating in the garbage.

1275
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:17,701
Come and pick it up.
Go man.

1276
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:20,534
Listen! They want only me.
-Go man.

1277
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:21,367
Go...

1278
01:16:22,978 --> 01:16:23,876
I’ll take care of it. Leave!

1279
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:27,882
Waste him!

1280
01:18:30,784 --> 01:18:31,876
What's going on over there?

1281
01:18:32,085 --> 01:18:35,054
Situation has gone worse. Get into
the car.- Driver, start the car.

1282
01:19:59,506 --> 01:20:19,553
Is it enough or you want more?

1283
01:20:19,959 --> 01:20:22,689
You unnecessarily picked up
fight with innocents.

1284
01:20:22,862 --> 01:20:24,329
You're educated, aren't you?

1285
01:20:24,531 --> 01:20:25,657
You pierced them with
umbrella needle.

1286
01:20:25,865 --> 01:20:27,662
You've fought with those college
students unnecessarily...

1287
01:20:27,867 --> 01:20:30,665
College students?
They're professional rowdies.

1288
01:20:31,137 --> 01:20:32,832
They're branding you people
like that.

1289
01:20:33,006 --> 01:20:36,134
They've filed a complaint saying 10 of
you joined together and attacked them.

1290
01:20:36,409 --> 01:20:39,139
With the music. Are you performing
any musical program?

1291
01:20:39,345 --> 01:20:40,642
Sir, we...- Be quiet.

1292
01:20:40,847 --> 01:20:43,645
Look, l've to hear your statement
also before filing the FlR.

1293
01:20:43,850 --> 01:20:46,648
It's my fate. l'm patient...
Don't irritate me.

1294
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:48,317
Say, whether you did it or not?

1295
01:20:48,521 --> 01:20:49,317
We'll take care of the rest.

1296
01:20:49,856 --> 01:20:51,983
There are eye witnesses to prove it.

1297
01:20:52,192 --> 01:20:54,319
lf we say no...you're not
going to register it.

1298
01:20:54,527 --> 01:20:56,654
Because, higher authorities would've
given you clear instructions.

1299
01:20:56,863 --> 01:20:57,830
You carry on with your work.

1300
01:21:03,069 --> 01:21:06,197
Union people are like this.
l'm doing my duty, that's all.

1301
01:21:06,473 --> 01:21:08,532
Ask your Union Lawyer to get
you out on bail.

1302
01:21:08,741 --> 01:21:10,368
Court will be on leave
tomorrow and next day.

1303
01:21:10,577 --> 01:21:11,703
You're going to be locked up
inside unnecessarily.

1304
01:21:11,911 --> 01:21:13,879
Okay, we'll be in the lock up,
but do lock us all in one cell.

1305
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,081
Don't separate me just
because l'm a woman.

1306
01:21:15,081 --> 01:21:16,878
Madam, he's the one who is accused...
others can leave.

1307
01:21:17,083 --> 01:21:18,880
How can we leave him behind
and go away?

1308
01:21:19,085 --> 01:21:19,881
Listen...go away....

1309
01:21:20,119 --> 01:21:22,212
Shall l inform the Union office...
- No need.

1310
01:21:22,422 --> 01:21:24,549
Sir, l can't afford to go out
on a bail.

1311
01:21:24,757 --> 01:21:27,055
l don't know have rich friends
who can get me out on bail.

1312
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:29,228
So, you carry on with your duty.

1313
01:21:29,429 --> 01:21:31,056
Think again, court will be
on leave for 2 days.

1314
01:21:31,264 --> 01:21:33,232
lsn't there anybody to get
you out on bail.- l'm here.

1315
01:21:35,668 --> 01:21:36,498
Madam, who are you?

1316
01:21:36,703 --> 01:21:38,102
l'm Bala. This is my Lawyer.

1317
01:21:38,271 --> 01:21:40,239
l've come to move bail application
on behalf of Nalla.

1318
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:41,737
Listen Bala, no need of all these things.

1319
01:21:42,775 --> 01:21:45,903
How's he related to you?
- We're lovers.

1320
01:21:46,279 --> 01:21:48,406
My father's name is
Kandasamy Padayachi.

1321
01:21:48,915 --> 01:21:51,076
Our Kandasamy Padayachi!- Yes sir.

1322
01:21:51,284 --> 01:21:55,414
Madam, please be seated.
Sir, please step aside.

1323
01:21:55,622 --> 01:21:57,590
Why?- Please, come sir.

1324
01:21:58,525 --> 01:22:01,756
Madam, you read this fully
and then sign it.

1325
01:22:01,995 --> 01:22:06,762
Couldn't you tell me this earlier?
You've trapped a rich girl.

1326
01:22:06,966 --> 01:22:08,433
We've to settle in our life using
opportunities like this.

1327
01:22:08,635 --> 01:22:10,762
How?- ''How''?
Take me for example.

1328
01:22:10,970 --> 01:22:11,595
Even, l'm like you.

1329
01:22:11,804 --> 01:22:13,271
You would've heard about
PK of Madurai, haven't you?

1330
01:22:13,873 --> 01:22:15,431
Don't you know P.K.?

1331
01:22:15,642 --> 01:22:17,769
l reached this position with
his influence only.

1332
01:22:17,977 --> 01:22:22,937
Or else, l would've remained a bachelor
constable all my life.

1333
01:22:26,352 --> 01:22:29,788
l was afraid thinking that
you were a true communist.

1334
01:22:29,989 --> 01:22:34,790
You're my man. Shake hand.
Enjoy. All the best.

1335
01:22:34,994 --> 01:22:37,121
Hey Constable, make it fast.

1336
01:23:00,386 --> 01:23:01,182
Where're you coming from?

1337
01:23:01,521 --> 01:23:03,989
Have you bailed out
that street dancer?

1338
01:23:04,390 --> 01:23:07,359
Yes. Logically, l should've
bailed you out.

1339
01:23:08,027 --> 01:23:09,824
But you had turned the tables.

1340
01:23:11,297 --> 01:23:14,164
What's this? - Where are you going...
- Please be patient.

1341
01:23:14,334 --> 01:23:16,894
She was brought up independently...
She's of modern generation.

1342
01:23:17,236 --> 01:23:19,363
What generation?
Am l dead?

1343
01:23:19,572 --> 01:23:20,698
My generation is still in vogue.

1344
01:23:20,907 --> 01:23:22,875
Only my rule should prevail here.

1345
01:23:23,409 --> 01:23:24,706
l'm going to perform her
marriage within 3 months.

1346
01:23:24,911 --> 01:23:26,378
l'll select a wealthy groom for her.

1347
01:23:26,579 --> 01:23:28,774
She should marry him.

1348
01:23:32,318 --> 01:23:33,785
Hello. l'm Poun, speaking.

1349
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:36,786
It's me...lot of problems
have cropped up here.

1350
01:23:37,423 --> 01:23:39,050
They've locked me up in a room.

1351
01:23:39,258 --> 01:23:40,384
Why? What's the matter?

1352
01:23:40,593 --> 01:23:43,061
l'll tell you later, l want to
meet Nalla immediately.

1353
01:23:43,262 --> 01:23:44,058
Come to the Union office.

1354
01:23:44,263 --> 01:23:46,390
Even Comrade will be there.
Both of you can meet there.

1355
01:23:46,599 --> 01:23:48,726
No, if l come there, father might
come to know about that.

1356
01:23:48,935 --> 01:23:51,233
Or else come our theater to watch
Anaconda film for relaxation.

1357
01:23:51,437 --> 01:23:53,735
My father is an operator there.
l'll ask Comrade also to come there.

1358
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:56,568
Both of you can talk to each other.
- Okay.

1359
01:24:15,795 --> 01:24:16,591
Where are you going?
-Bathroom

1360
01:24:16,963 --> 01:24:17,588
Come soon.

1361
01:24:19,132 --> 01:24:21,362
Dear, where are you going?
- She'll come back! now!

1362
01:24:23,636 --> 01:24:24,603
'Nalla Pambu!' (Cobra in Tamil)

1363
01:24:24,804 --> 01:24:27,102
It's not Cobra, but Python.

1364
01:24:27,807 --> 01:24:30,105
Come, call me if there's any noise
from the projector.

1365
01:24:30,309 --> 01:24:31,708
You don't touch it...
lt'll burn!

1366
01:24:33,479 --> 01:24:34,776
Comrade, would you like to
have something?

1367
01:24:36,115 --> 01:24:36,774
Coffee or Tea?

1368
01:24:37,650 --> 01:24:38,116
Okay...

1369
01:24:40,653 --> 01:24:42,780
Only few minutes are left. What?

1370
01:24:47,493 --> 01:24:47,959
What's this?

1371
01:24:48,161 --> 01:24:49,458
That day you...- Stop it...

1372
01:24:49,662 --> 01:24:51,527
Are you returning the bail amount
which l paid?

1373
01:24:54,667 --> 01:24:56,294
Are you trying to settle
the accounts?

1374
01:24:59,005 --> 01:25:02,202
That's not my money but
your own money.

1375
01:25:03,509 --> 01:25:05,807
You painted a painting in
my father's office, didn't you?

1376
01:25:06,012 --> 01:25:06,808
That payment...

1377
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:08,806
l don't want any payment for that.

1378
01:25:09,015 --> 01:25:14,317
l did that for affection! You...

1379
01:25:15,855 --> 01:25:17,220
Are you calling me formally?

1380
01:25:18,024 --> 01:25:20,959
Has love became affection? Damn.

1381
01:25:22,161 --> 01:25:26,257
What? What's happening?
What is this?

1382
01:25:27,366 --> 01:25:32,497
Please, allow me to talk.
- l know what you're going to say.

1383
01:25:33,039 --> 01:25:33,664
No, what l'm...

1384
01:25:38,044 --> 01:25:40,171
l'm rich and you're poor.

1385
01:25:42,381 --> 01:25:46,841
You've a doubt if you can keep
me happy all my life.

1386
01:25:48,888 --> 01:25:51,516
No doubt...But, l'm damn sure!
- Lie!

1387
01:25:52,959 --> 01:25:53,789
It's a lie.

1388
01:25:55,561 --> 01:25:56,027
Yes.

1389
01:25:57,730 --> 01:25:59,698
Shall l tell you the true reason?

1390
01:26:00,833 --> 01:26:02,027
Because, you're selfish.

1391
01:26:05,071 --> 01:26:07,938
Bala, l don't know how to make you
understand...- No need...

1392
01:26:09,609 --> 01:26:10,541
l understand.

1393
01:26:12,411 --> 01:26:14,038
Love is fun!

1394
01:26:15,081 --> 01:26:16,480
But, when it comes to the marriage.
It's a problem.

1395
01:26:17,583 --> 01:26:18,811
You'll lose your freedom, won't you?

1396
01:26:22,088 --> 01:26:23,385
We'll lose our freedom!

1397
01:26:24,757 --> 01:26:31,060
Your father's influence...We can't
fight him all our life.

1398
01:26:31,430 --> 01:26:31,896
So.....

1399
01:26:35,768 --> 01:26:36,234
So.....

1400
01:26:37,436 --> 01:26:39,301
Marry a rich boy of your
father's choice...

1401
01:26:39,438 --> 01:26:39,904
No.

1402
01:26:42,608 --> 01:26:43,074
No.

1403
01:26:53,119 --> 01:26:57,317
l'll marry another person!

1404
01:27:05,965 --> 01:27:07,660
l'll marry another person.

1405
01:27:09,635 --> 01:27:12,866
It's enough if you attend my marriage
sitting in the front row.

1406
01:27:13,306 --> 01:27:14,534
And bless me!

1407
01:27:15,141 --> 01:27:17,769
But that'll only be yielding
and not my marriage.

1408
01:27:25,818 --> 01:27:30,118
A corpse will get married
and beget a child.

1409
01:27:30,990 --> 01:27:32,617
Can l name my child after you?

1410
01:27:34,994 --> 01:27:36,962
What's this Bala?...
- Go to hell.

1411
01:27:42,001 --> 01:27:42,467
Sorry.

1412
01:27:44,170 --> 01:27:45,797
l'm going to hell.
- Wait.

1413
01:27:49,508 --> 01:27:49,974
Thanks.

1414
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:54,646
Comrade, what's the noise here?

1415
01:27:54,847 --> 01:27:56,314
What happened? Why's she crying?

1416
01:27:56,482 --> 01:27:57,779
Comrade, what did you do to make her cry?

1417
01:27:58,184 --> 01:27:59,811
No, l'm not crying!

1418
01:28:00,519 --> 01:28:04,319
Your leader is struggling
for a girl's life.

1419
01:28:04,857 --> 01:28:07,655
He'll write it and give!
You enact that on the streets.

1420
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:09,327
l can't get you....tell in a simpler
way for us to understand.

1421
01:28:09,528 --> 01:28:11,325
Didn't you get her?

1422
01:28:11,530 --> 01:28:15,330
He doesn't want to fall in love with
a rich girl under these circumstances.

1423
01:28:15,534 --> 01:28:17,331
That's right.- What's right?

1424
01:28:17,536 --> 01:28:20,505
When he loved her, was she poor?
Didn't he know that then?

1425
01:28:20,706 --> 01:28:21,832
What can Comrade do for that?

1426
01:28:22,041 --> 01:28:25,010
He needn't do anything.
Let us all decide.

1427
01:28:25,211 --> 01:28:27,270
What decision!- A Good decision?

1428
01:28:27,713 --> 01:28:31,012
Good decision?
- For this love story!

1429
01:28:31,217 --> 01:28:33,845
Don't say that they're in love.
Both of them....

1430
01:28:35,054 --> 01:28:35,520
Did you see?

1431
01:28:35,721 --> 01:28:37,848
Why do you fight when you both
love each other so deeply?

1432
01:28:38,057 --> 01:28:40,025
Can't you go somewhere
and get married?

1433
01:28:40,226 --> 01:28:41,193
Yes. That's it!

1434
01:28:41,394 --> 01:28:44,192
Venkatesh, when did you come?
- l'll present myself at the right moment.

1435
01:28:44,563 --> 01:28:46,030
Should we stop breathing
fearing Padayachi?

1436
01:28:46,232 --> 01:28:48,700
We all must plan something
and get them married.

1437
01:28:48,901 --> 01:28:50,698
Correct, what l am trying to say is...
- Wait...l'll say...

1438
01:28:50,903 --> 01:28:53,371
We'll take them to Kerala discretely
and get them married there.

1439
01:28:53,572 --> 01:28:55,199
There are many of our kind
to support us!

1440
01:28:55,908 --> 01:28:57,535
We'll send them to Karnataka
on a honeymoon.

1441
01:28:57,743 --> 01:28:59,040
Even we can join their
marriage, right?

1442
01:28:59,245 --> 01:29:00,371
2 witnesses are enough!

1443
01:29:00,579 --> 01:29:02,206
Good idea...But suggest if there's
any other better idea.

1444
01:29:02,415 --> 01:29:04,383
There is another idea.
l'll tell it later.

1445
01:29:04,583 --> 01:29:07,711
It's wrong for many of us to
be in the cabin. Please go...

1446
01:29:15,561 --> 01:29:16,892
Oh! What a fall?

1447
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:19,898
Painting...Street drama...ldeology...
After talking all this...

1448
01:29:20,099 --> 01:29:22,067
You were walking bravely
with a moustache.

1449
01:29:22,268 --> 01:29:25,066
The moment you saw a girl, you're
running away. Aren't you ashamed?

1450
01:29:26,439 --> 01:29:28,066
Even Karl Marx fell in love...
What's there to feel ashamed of?

1451
01:29:28,274 --> 01:29:29,332
What happened to you?

1452
01:29:29,942 --> 01:29:32,342
Don't you really know anything
or just pretending so?

1453
01:29:33,612 --> 01:29:34,135
Take your hands off.

1454
01:29:36,949 --> 01:29:38,246
l asked you, ain't l?- What?

1455
01:29:38,784 --> 01:29:39,580
You're pretending, aren't you?

1456
01:29:40,619 --> 01:29:42,587
Really, l didn't get you.

1457
01:29:42,955 --> 01:29:44,081
Do you want me to say it
in chaste Tamil?

1458
01:29:44,623 --> 01:29:45,920
Why are you people
behaving like this?

1459
01:29:46,625 --> 01:29:48,923
Who?- Who?

1460
01:29:51,964 --> 01:29:56,424
Got muddied, beaten up by the police.
Got bitten by a dog.

1461
01:29:56,635 --> 01:29:58,603
Will you understand only when told
with a rich man's arrogance?

1462
01:30:03,642 --> 01:30:06,110
l didn't know all this...- What?

1463
01:30:06,312 --> 01:30:12,273
By wearing a salwar, l didn't
know how to fondle you.

1464
01:30:13,486 --> 01:30:15,283
Are you talking about Bala?
- Then who else?.

1465
01:30:16,155 --> 01:30:18,123
Shall l keep a mirror?
- No...ln hotel...

1466
01:30:18,324 --> 01:30:19,848
What did you see in her?

1467
01:30:23,996 --> 01:30:24,462
You...

1468
01:30:25,831 --> 01:30:27,458
She's very pretty, isn't she?

1469
01:30:27,833 --> 01:30:29,130
Mirror itself has passed the judgment!
Then, what?

1470
01:30:29,668 --> 01:30:31,397
Why are you talking like that
even you're...

1471
01:30:32,271 --> 01:30:33,295
You're pretty, you know?

1472
01:30:33,506 --> 01:30:36,634
Pretty? l'm like a man! Why?

1473
01:30:38,177 --> 01:30:39,474
lf you wear a pant and shirt...- Why?

1474
01:30:40,179 --> 01:30:42,306
Why did l wear pant and shirt?
For you only.

1475
01:30:42,681 --> 01:30:44,979
Only for you l wore this attire.
Rode a bike...

1476
01:30:45,351 --> 01:30:46,648
l never liked coffee and tea.

1477
01:30:47,186 --> 01:30:49,746
Just because you're taking it,
even l started.

1478
01:30:50,022 --> 01:30:51,990
All my efforts have gone to the dogs.
Forget it.

1479
01:30:52,358 --> 01:30:53,382
Hey wait!

1480
01:30:53,592 --> 01:30:55,822
What wait? You're going away
by packing your baggage.

1481
01:30:56,028 --> 01:30:56,653
Then, why to wait?

1482
01:30:59,331 --> 01:31:00,855
From your words, l feel you love...

1483
01:31:01,367 --> 01:31:05,497
Wow! Columbus...
You've discovered it!

1484
01:31:05,704 --> 01:31:08,537
You never told me about this!

1485
01:31:08,741 --> 01:31:10,174
Do l've to tell you this?

1486
01:31:10,376 --> 01:31:13,072
l was after you since 4 years.
Everyone knows it.

1487
01:31:13,279 --> 01:31:14,371
Only you didn't notice it, did you?

1488
01:31:15,314 --> 01:31:18,112
l couldn't...according to me
we both are Comrades, that's all.

1489
01:31:18,317 --> 01:31:21,514
That's why, you were boring me with
all this.- Don't talk like that.

1490
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:22,414
l really like you...

1491
01:31:23,222 --> 01:31:25,349
Don't repeat ''that you like me''.

1492
01:31:25,558 --> 01:31:28,049
Understand one thing. Like and love,
both are different.

1493
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:28,851
Yeah!

1494
01:31:32,832 --> 01:31:34,732
Like and love, both are different.

1495
01:31:35,668 --> 01:31:37,499
Yeah!
- Yeah!

1496
01:31:38,838 --> 01:31:40,169
Yes, l was ignorant.

1497
01:31:41,307 --> 01:31:42,934
But for that...committing suicide...

1498
01:31:43,375 --> 01:31:46,310
Why do you talk like an idiot?

1499
01:31:46,612 --> 01:31:48,307
l was about to say that
l won't commit suicide.

1500
01:31:48,581 --> 01:31:49,570
l'm a courageous girl!

1501
01:31:50,983 --> 01:31:51,972
l'm sorry...
- Go man!

1502
01:31:56,622 --> 01:31:59,250
Sorry...
- It's alright.

1503
01:32:02,928 --> 01:32:07,422
l betrayed!- Whom did you betray?

1504
01:32:09,335 --> 01:32:11,360
Do you mean the one who's
in our troupe?

1505
01:32:12,071 --> 01:32:15,302
What's it?- He is begging me for the
past 3 yrs. to marry him.

1506
01:32:15,508 --> 01:32:16,099
Oh!

1507
01:32:16,308 --> 01:32:18,208
But, it was me.....

1508
01:32:23,382 --> 01:32:25,816
For that, don't think that
l won't be happy!

1509
01:32:26,051 --> 01:32:29,782
l'll marry before you marry her.

1510
01:32:30,723 --> 01:32:33,157
Oh!...What am l talking?

1511
01:32:35,327 --> 01:32:37,522
Come...- No, l'll do it
by myself.

1512
01:32:37,730 --> 01:32:39,925
Shouldn't l do even this?

1513
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:42,767
Hereafter, Bala is everything
for you.

1514
01:32:42,968 --> 01:32:43,434
Bye.

1515
01:32:45,137 --> 01:32:47,264
Where are you going?- l should lie on
somebody's shoulder and cry.

1516
01:32:47,473 --> 01:32:48,667
l'll go to Venkatesh!

1517
01:32:49,808 --> 01:32:52,106
Then, one more thing.- What's it?

1518
01:32:53,045 --> 01:32:55,775
Venkatesh shouldn't come to know
all that l had told you now.

1519
01:32:57,116 --> 01:32:57,673
Yeah!

1520
01:32:58,784 --> 01:32:59,682
Yeah!....Yeah!

1521
01:33:01,153 --> 01:33:05,055
Because, it'll hurt him
all his life.

1522
01:33:09,128 --> 01:33:09,719
Go man...

1523
01:33:14,266 --> 01:33:15,198
When did you come?

1524
01:33:17,803 --> 01:33:18,462
So sad!

1525
01:33:19,805 --> 01:33:21,466
What happened to you?
Headache?

1526
01:33:22,508 --> 01:33:23,372
Stomach-ache?

1527
01:33:24,076 --> 01:33:25,475
Should we get only headache
and stomach-ache?

1528
01:33:25,678 --> 01:33:27,578
Shouldn't we fall in love, Comrade?

1529
01:33:29,014 --> 01:33:31,448
Love? Whom are you loving?

1530
01:33:32,017 --> 01:33:33,985
My love is going away climbing
down the stairs.

1531
01:33:36,455 --> 01:33:42,155
Whom, Mehr, Are you joking?
- Is this a joke?

1532
01:33:42,361 --> 01:33:43,055
l'm sorry.

1533
01:33:43,429 --> 01:33:46,557
Between you and her...
- Only 4 yrs difference!

1534
01:33:47,032 --> 01:33:50,229
Apart from that you're 3/4th ft.
shorter than her.

1535
01:33:50,436 --> 01:33:52,301
Love is blind, Comrade.

1536
01:33:53,138 --> 01:33:53,763
Right.

1537
01:33:54,139 --> 01:33:56,903
Poet Kannadasan said that our anatomies
should also match to fall in love.

1538
01:33:57,610 --> 01:33:58,542
Hey...l'm sorry.

1539
01:34:01,413 --> 01:34:05,247
Where are you going?- lf l cry on their
marriage, her life will ruin.

1540
01:34:05,651 --> 01:34:07,118
l'll come and cry in
your marriage.

1541
01:34:07,319 --> 01:34:08,843
At least, you'll understand me.

1542
01:34:09,622 --> 01:34:11,556
What? Can l come or not?

1543
01:34:12,758 --> 01:34:13,850
l don't know whether
to cry or laugh?

1544
01:34:14,059 --> 01:34:17,392
Why do you get confused for this?
You laugh...l'll cry.

1545
01:34:19,298 --> 01:34:22,062
lf we keep on talking like this.
We'll miss the bus.

1546
01:34:22,401 --> 01:34:23,299
Oh God!

1547
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:31,005
What are you saying?
Chenniappan called from Madras.

1548
01:34:31,744 --> 01:34:33,712
It seems your daughter didn't
reach there by the morning flight.

1549
01:34:33,912 --> 01:34:35,709
You gave her a send off at
the Coimbatore airport.

1550
01:34:36,015 --> 01:34:40,349
Yes, l went up to the security check.
l didn't go after that.

1551
01:34:41,587 --> 01:34:42,815
Where did she vanish?

1552
01:34:43,088 --> 01:34:46,683
l came to know that the Union man
and your daughter...

1553
01:34:47,159 --> 01:34:52,529
...Are planning to get married secretly in Kerala.
- Where is he now?

1554
01:34:53,599 --> 01:34:55,863
l got the information that he went by
the morning bus to Kerala.

1555
01:34:56,535 --> 01:34:58,127
Even your daughter would be
with him.

1556
01:35:04,943 --> 01:35:05,967
Ticket....Ticket.

1557
01:35:06,378 --> 01:35:09,609
Give me change, please.

1558
01:35:22,761 --> 01:35:25,389
Stop...

1559
01:35:25,597 --> 01:35:27,758
Don't run in the
middle of the road.

1560
01:36:51,183 --> 01:36:54,209
Don't worry....nothing...

1561
01:37:00,692 --> 01:37:01,818
Go quickly.

1562
01:37:07,366 --> 01:37:08,162
l'm here.

1563
01:37:08,367 --> 01:37:09,425
Give me your hand.

1564
01:37:09,701 --> 01:37:10,998
Comrade! - Wait.

1565
01:37:11,370 --> 01:37:11,893
Comrade!

1566
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,329
Hold this.

1567
01:37:14,373 --> 01:37:15,499
l'm not able to reach it, Comrade.

1568
01:37:16,375 --> 01:37:17,171
Still not able to reach it.

1569
01:37:17,376 --> 01:37:20,106
l'm just 5 feet 3 inches, Am l...

1570
01:37:20,546 --> 01:37:21,444
Pull me out, Comrade.

1571
01:37:36,895 --> 01:37:38,192
This bloody dog was responsible
for the bus accident.

1572
01:37:38,397 --> 01:37:40,524
Beat it...kill it.

1573
01:38:13,432 --> 01:38:17,061
Search all over the place.

1574
01:38:17,269 --> 01:38:18,236
Look there.

1575
01:38:18,437 --> 01:38:19,904
That bloody dog caused the bus
to overturn..

1576
01:38:20,105 --> 01:38:20,628
Beat it.

1577
01:38:22,608 --> 01:38:23,404
Buddy, it has run away.

1578
01:38:24,276 --> 01:38:25,834
A body is lying there.

1579
01:38:26,278 --> 01:38:27,302
Oh No, he's still alive.

1580
01:38:29,114 --> 01:38:31,912
It's impossible to save him.
- Can we leave him here?

1581
01:38:32,117 --> 01:38:34,085
Come...this side....
- Hold properly.

1582
01:38:41,793 --> 01:38:42,760
Check if my daughter is there.

1583
01:38:43,295 --> 01:38:47,095
Move...move...
Come quickly...

1584
01:38:47,299 --> 01:38:48,323
Thank God, she's not my daughter.

1585
01:38:50,135 --> 01:38:52,660
Move quickly...Put him into the
ambulance quickly.

1586
01:38:52,971 --> 01:38:53,596
Move.

1587
01:38:54,806 --> 01:38:57,001
May l know the survivors' list?

1588
01:38:57,809 --> 01:39:00,607
A man named Nallavar.
And a girl.

1589
01:39:00,812 --> 01:39:01,608
Girl's name?

1590
01:39:02,147 --> 01:39:04,547
Girl's name is Parvathi.

1591
01:39:04,983 --> 01:39:06,780
Thank God, she's not your daughter.

1592
01:39:06,985 --> 01:39:09,010
When she has eloped to marry,
won't she change her name?

1593
01:39:09,321 --> 01:39:10,117
Take out the vehicle.

1594
01:39:18,830 --> 01:39:21,458
Boss, this girl is not your daughter.

1595
01:39:22,167 --> 01:39:23,634
Hail Lord Siva for his mercy.

1596
01:39:23,835 --> 01:39:25,700
But, he's here, Boss.

1597
01:39:43,522 --> 01:39:45,490
Excuse me. He's serious.

1598
01:39:45,691 --> 01:39:47,318
This is not a visiting hour.

1599
01:39:47,526 --> 01:39:48,993
He's a close relative.

1600
01:39:49,194 --> 01:39:51,594
Nalla, do you know these gentlemen?

1601
01:39:54,366 --> 01:39:57,733
Will he survive?
- Just 20./. chance.

1602
01:39:58,203 --> 01:39:59,830
Don't tell the patient.

1603
01:40:00,205 --> 01:40:01,968
We're going in for a surgery.

1604
01:40:02,207 --> 01:40:04,675
Talk to him positively
and affectionately.

1605
01:40:04,876 --> 01:40:07,845
Not much, just 10 minutes only.

1606
01:40:08,046 --> 01:40:09,513
Please give him some hope.

1607
01:40:09,715 --> 01:40:11,342
My boss owns a hospital
in Coimbatore.

1608
01:40:11,550 --> 01:40:12,915
Only 10 minutes.

1609
01:40:31,069 --> 01:40:32,093
Don't worry.

1610
01:40:32,904 --> 01:40:35,372
l'll not kill you with a pillow.

1611
01:40:36,241 --> 01:40:37,538
l'm not that sort.

1612
01:40:41,246 --> 01:40:45,046
Thousands of families are living
on my mercy.

1613
01:40:45,584 --> 01:40:47,211
You tried to spoil my
family's reputation.

1614
01:40:54,926 --> 01:40:57,656
Hail Lord Siva for his mercy.

1615
01:40:59,431 --> 01:41:00,125
Did you see?

1616
01:41:01,266 --> 01:41:03,461
Do you know how many years
l have been praying?

1617
01:41:04,603 --> 01:41:06,230
Never missed a day.

1618
01:41:06,938 --> 01:41:07,734
Even when l'm visiting
foreign countries,

1619
01:41:07,939 --> 01:41:10,339
l take an idol with me to pray.

1620
01:41:11,443 --> 01:41:12,910
Is it any cinema story?

1621
01:41:14,780 --> 01:41:17,248
Marry a rich girl and live in a hut.

1622
01:41:18,950 --> 01:41:19,575
Truth.

1623
01:41:20,786 --> 01:41:24,483
Hey Sunny, do you know
what's the truth?

1624
01:41:25,123 --> 01:41:27,421
Every day l pray for 2 hours.

1625
01:41:28,126 --> 01:41:29,252
That's the truth.

1626
01:41:30,462 --> 01:41:32,487
l could've reduced you to ashes..

1627
01:41:33,298 --> 01:41:35,163
But, l didn't do it. Why?

1628
01:41:36,468 --> 01:41:38,936
l know Lord Siva will punish
you for your sins.

1629
01:41:40,472 --> 01:41:43,373
Boon!....It's a boon to me.

1630
01:41:45,310 --> 01:41:49,110
You're a poor Communist party worker.

1631
01:41:49,314 --> 01:41:51,179
Do you want a millionaire's daughter?

1632
01:41:51,483 --> 01:41:54,281
Boss, pull out the oxygen tube.
Let him die.

1633
01:41:55,987 --> 01:41:59,388
l'll not do such things.
He'll take care of it.

1634
01:41:59,658 --> 01:42:01,387
Arrangements are being made
only for that.

1635
01:42:05,997 --> 01:42:09,797
Did they tell you, that you've only 10./.
chance to survive.

1636
01:42:10,001 --> 01:42:11,298
Boss, 20./.!

1637
01:42:12,337 --> 01:42:13,804
Why does he need that additional 10./.?

1638
01:42:14,005 --> 01:42:14,972
Let him give up that also.

1639
01:42:18,176 --> 01:42:19,871
Hey, give up that 10./. also.

1640
01:42:21,012 --> 01:42:25,813
Can l marry my daughter to this 10./.
living dead man?

1641
01:42:26,017 --> 01:42:28,315
Tell me, sunny.
lmpossible, isn't it?

1642
01:42:29,187 --> 01:42:32,486
This is not my wish.
God's order.

1643
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:35,485
Die.

1644
01:42:37,362 --> 01:42:38,226
Heard it?

1645
01:42:40,031 --> 01:42:41,828
Die.

1646
01:42:45,237 --> 01:42:47,671
What's all this?
l told you only 10 mins.

1647
01:42:47,873 --> 01:42:49,500
Sister, he's chanting prayers for his
early recovery.

1648
01:42:49,708 --> 01:42:50,732
No....No...

1649
01:42:50,942 --> 01:42:52,569
Out....out....

1650
01:42:52,811 --> 01:42:54,108
Oh my God!

1651
01:42:54,946 --> 01:42:56,675
Doctor....Doctor...

1652
01:42:56,882 --> 01:42:58,645
You gentlemen leave right now.

1653
01:42:59,217 --> 01:43:09,183
Anbe Sivam...
Singers: Kamal Haasan & Karthik.
Music: Vidhyasagar Lyrics: Vairamuthu

1654
01:43:36,888 --> 01:43:41,791
Who's God?

1655
01:43:46,398 --> 01:43:52,598
You and me are Gods.

1656
01:43:59,077 --> 01:44:04,379
Life is a penance.

1657
01:44:05,584 --> 01:44:11,489
Love is God.

1658
01:44:12,090 --> 01:44:18,222
For theists, God is love.

1659
01:44:18,430 --> 01:44:24,733
For atheists, Love is God.

1660
01:44:24,936 --> 01:44:37,644
Let's all say together in
one voice...Love is God.

1661
01:45:12,851 --> 01:45:16,412
Come on....Come on...
That's it. Come on.

1662
01:45:23,261 --> 01:45:24,387
Can you read it?

1663
01:45:27,666 --> 01:45:28,291
Now.

1664
01:45:28,934 --> 01:45:30,367
A.....D....7...

1665
01:45:38,677 --> 01:45:41,646
Don't forget to take your medicines
and your exercises.

1666
01:45:41,846 --> 01:45:43,973
Nalla, l forgot something.

1667
01:45:45,016 --> 01:45:46,347
God bless you my son.

1668
01:45:47,385 --> 01:45:49,046
Bye....Bye...

1669
01:46:12,978 --> 01:46:13,603
Please be seated.

1670
01:46:14,646 --> 01:46:15,271
Why have you come here?

1671
01:46:16,481 --> 01:46:18,381
To meet Bala.

1672
01:46:20,485 --> 01:46:21,850
She has settled in a foreign country.

1673
01:46:24,322 --> 01:46:25,380
She's married.

1674
01:46:29,327 --> 01:46:29,793
When?

1675
01:46:30,328 --> 01:46:31,454
4 months ago.

1676
01:46:37,669 --> 01:46:39,796
Just now, l've got the good news
that she's pregnant.

1677
01:46:40,338 --> 01:46:42,863
Don't spoil her life now,
by expressing your love.

1678
01:46:43,842 --> 01:46:46,140
They say, we can tell 1000 lies
to conduct a marriage.

1679
01:46:47,345 --> 01:46:49,472
l could've told my
daughter 5000 lies.

1680
01:46:51,016 --> 01:46:53,211
But, l got her married with
just one lie.

1681
01:46:54,853 --> 01:46:56,980
l told her, you're dead.

1682
01:46:58,523 --> 01:47:00,320
She believed my word.

1683
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:02,986
Cried for some days.

1684
01:47:04,029 --> 01:47:06,896
Then seeing me in distress, she agreed
to this marriage.

1685
01:47:07,532 --> 01:47:09,898
lmagine yourself in my position
as a father and think.

1686
01:47:10,201 --> 01:47:11,429
You'll understand everything.

1687
01:47:14,205 --> 01:47:15,900
l've told just one lie.

1688
01:47:17,208 --> 01:47:19,005
Don't make me a killer.

1689
01:47:23,548 --> 01:47:26,574
Hey! Don't think that
l'm threatening you.

1690
01:47:27,552 --> 01:47:29,349
l can give you as much money as you ask.

1691
01:47:30,055 --> 01:47:31,454
l've never desired anyone's downfall.

1692
01:47:32,057 --> 01:47:33,524
Everyone should live happily.

1693
01:47:43,735 --> 01:47:49,867
Don't think l'm going away because of
your threats or money power?

1694
01:47:53,078 --> 01:47:54,545
You said something about love.

1695
01:47:56,748 --> 01:47:58,147
l'm going away only for that love.

1696
01:48:05,423 --> 01:48:08,221
Take it as a boon from me,
which your God denied you.

1697
01:48:10,929 --> 01:48:13,227
l'll remain a dead man for
your daughter.

1698
01:48:27,779 --> 01:48:29,246
Hey, Bloody fool,
drive carefully.

1699
01:48:30,281 --> 01:48:31,407
Live like a King.

1700
01:48:31,950 --> 01:48:33,247
Sister! - Come here.

1701
01:48:33,451 --> 01:48:34,315
Pour this.

1702
01:48:35,620 --> 01:48:36,917
Why're you watching that valley?

1703
01:48:37,122 --> 01:48:38,589
When we took you out from there.

1704
01:48:38,790 --> 01:48:41,088
We never imagined that you'll
survive and come back to us.

1705
01:48:41,292 --> 01:48:42,259
It's all the expertise of the Doctors.

1706
01:48:42,460 --> 01:48:45,429
Doctors? You survived because of the
good deeds of your parents.

1707
01:48:45,630 --> 01:48:48,428
It's my parent's good deeds that
saved my shop from the bus.

1708
01:48:48,633 --> 01:48:51,261
Sir, people who survive near death
are said to be equal to God.

1709
01:48:51,469 --> 01:48:52,936
Now, you're God. Yes.

1710
01:48:53,138 --> 01:48:54,867
You too! - Me too?

1711
01:48:56,141 --> 01:48:59,770
Anyone who shows human compassion
is God according to me.

1712
01:48:59,978 --> 01:49:01,275
It's good to hear...

1713
01:49:01,479 --> 01:49:02,946
Come here, lazy bones.

1714
01:49:03,148 --> 01:49:04,775
How many times have l told you
to keep this inside?

1715
01:49:04,983 --> 01:49:05,950
Allow it to get crushed under
the bus wheels?

1716
01:49:06,151 --> 01:49:07,618
Never let down an opportunity
to eat.

1717
01:49:07,819 --> 01:49:09,116
l'll make a special chicken
delicacy for you.

1718
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:10,446
You must eat and then only
leave this place.

1719
01:49:10,655 --> 01:49:12,623
Won't you invite me also?
- Get lost man.

1720
01:49:12,824 --> 01:49:14,951
He has come alive from near death.
So, l'm preparing a special dish for him.

1721
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:17,287
You're fit for nothing.
Why do you need all this?

1722
01:49:17,495 --> 01:49:19,292
l remembered when you said
about dressing a chicken.

1723
01:49:19,497 --> 01:49:21,965
Sacrifice that 'Satan' for him.
Everything will be fine.

1724
01:49:22,167 --> 01:49:23,293
What harm did it do to you?

1725
01:49:23,501 --> 01:49:25,799
It overturned a bus, didn't it?
That Satan.

1726
01:49:26,171 --> 01:49:27,229
Who's that Satan?

1727
01:49:27,505 --> 01:49:30,133
He's telling about that dog
sleeping there.

1728
01:49:37,515 --> 01:49:39,813
No way! lt'll not respond
to anyone's call.

1729
01:49:40,018 --> 01:49:42,486
lt'll come only for food.
Look, how clever it is.

1730
01:49:57,702 --> 01:49:59,169
Sister, look there.

1731
01:49:59,370 --> 01:50:01,998
The dog has come to him and falling at his
feet asking for forgiveness.

1732
01:50:02,207 --> 01:50:04,505
Hey, do you know dog's
language also?

1733
01:50:06,544 --> 01:50:08,011
What's the dog's name?
- Name is Satan.

1734
01:50:08,213 --> 01:50:10,511
It was named like that by all here.
We can't change it now.

1735
01:50:10,715 --> 01:50:11,682
Whose dog is it?

1736
01:50:11,883 --> 01:50:14,078
No one in particular.
Public property.

1737
01:50:14,385 --> 01:50:17,013
lt'll eat from whoever offers food and
rest in any shady place.

1738
01:50:18,723 --> 01:50:19,849
Me too!

1739
01:50:22,393 --> 01:50:24,190
Can l take it with me?

1740
01:50:24,562 --> 01:50:27,861
Hey, Look at this Satan's luck.

1741
01:50:28,566 --> 01:50:32,366
Don't worry. You'll recover and
be fine very soon.- Okay.

1742
01:50:32,904 --> 01:50:35,202
She too got hurt when she was young.
But, now she's fine.

1743
01:50:35,406 --> 01:50:36,202
Okay...okay.

1744
01:50:40,078 --> 01:50:42,546
Bye...- Bye...

1745
01:50:44,082 --> 01:50:44,776
l'll take leave now.

1746
01:50:45,583 --> 01:50:47,050
lf you come this side anytime,
do visit us.

1747
01:50:47,252 --> 01:50:48,981
Definitely.
- Don't forget us.

1748
01:51:04,769 --> 01:51:06,828
Coromandel may be arrived.
Get ready.

1749
01:51:10,608 --> 01:51:13,577
Here take this biscuit and mineral water.
- Thank you.

1750
01:51:15,613 --> 01:51:17,240
Didn't he say train is arriving?

1751
01:51:17,448 --> 01:51:19,245
It seems they'll not accept,
Credit card here also?

1752
01:51:19,450 --> 01:51:21,247
But, you've bought tickets haven't you?
- Only second class.

1753
01:51:21,452 --> 01:51:23,147
It seems there's no first class
in the entire train.

1754
01:51:24,289 --> 01:51:26,257
Okay....Come...- Go.

1755
01:51:26,457 --> 01:51:29,085
lsn't it enough to reach your destination
in some class in this rain?

1756
01:51:29,294 --> 01:51:31,489
You're incorrigible sir.

1757
01:51:31,963 --> 01:51:33,760
This country never offers comforts even
if you're ready to pay for them.

1758
01:51:33,998 --> 01:51:35,260
That's lndia for you.

1759
01:51:35,633 --> 01:51:39,091
Till people like you, who think they can
get anything anywhere for money.

1760
01:51:39,304 --> 01:51:40,601
That'll be lndia for you.

1761
01:51:40,805 --> 01:51:45,037
Yeah! You'll immediately say
Soviet Union is best in the world.

1762
01:51:45,310 --> 01:51:47,608
No, we can't say like that now.
- Say like that.

1763
01:51:47,979 --> 01:51:51,938
Whether you accept or not, Soviet Union
is no more a United Nation.

1764
01:51:52,150 --> 01:51:53,515
It has broken up into small countries.

1765
01:51:53,985 --> 01:51:57,443
Now, no Soviet Union means
....no Communism, isn't it?

1766
01:51:57,655 --> 01:51:59,054
Then, why're you going on
talking about it?

1767
01:52:00,525 --> 01:52:01,617
Mr. Romeo.

1768
01:52:02,660 --> 01:52:06,061
For instance, if Taj Mahal
crumbles down...

1769
01:52:06,497 --> 01:52:08,294
Will you all stop loving?

1770
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:11,127
Okay. Very clever....very clever.

1771
01:52:11,336 --> 01:52:14,305
But Mr. Red, Love is a feeling.

1772
01:52:15,506 --> 01:52:17,804
Communism too is a feeling.

1773
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:21,145
Many had feIt that way earlier too.

1774
01:52:21,346 --> 01:52:23,814
But, Karl Marx wrote about it and turned
it into a doctrine.- Oh rubbish!

1775
01:52:24,015 --> 01:52:26,984
l mustn't be talking about it to you.
Especially, you shouldn't talk.

1776
01:52:27,352 --> 01:52:27,818
Why?

1777
01:52:28,519 --> 01:52:31,750
Because...train has arrived.
- Oh! Train has arrived.

1778
01:52:35,026 --> 01:52:38,484
Why shouldn't l talk? - Can you bear the
truth?- Then go ahead, hit me.

1779
01:52:39,263 --> 01:52:43,222
Because, you're a selfish coolie.
- Excuse me.

1780
01:52:43,701 --> 01:52:51,039
You're a hawker selling products of
Multinational companies on the TV.

1781
01:52:51,242 --> 01:52:54,803
Mr. Sivam, that's my business, okay.

1782
01:52:55,046 --> 01:52:57,173
ln the name of business, if you
sell off of everything.

1783
01:52:57,382 --> 01:53:00,442
He's already claiming rights over
Turmeric, Basmati Rice.

1784
01:53:00,718 --> 01:53:03,186
lf you bend backwards to
salute him for money.

1785
01:53:03,388 --> 01:53:06,118
Won't l doubt whether it's
spinal cord or rubber cord?

1786
01:53:06,324 --> 01:53:08,121
Listen, don't get personal. Okay.

1787
01:53:08,393 --> 01:53:12,124
With your dirty face and handicaps.
You're very proud.

1788
01:53:12,397 --> 01:53:15,230
lsn't this personal? - That's...

1789
01:53:15,433 --> 01:53:17,526
Yeah....Yeah...You started it.

1790
01:53:17,902 --> 01:53:19,870
Okay, l did. Shouldn't l finish it?

1791
01:53:20,571 --> 01:53:22,539
l'll tell you one thing. Will you hear it
without getting angry?- Go ahead.

1792
01:53:23,074 --> 01:53:25,042
Pharaohs had buiIt Pyramids,
hadn't they?

1793
01:53:25,243 --> 01:53:27,803
You are all like those slaves
who carried stones then?

1794
01:53:28,413 --> 01:53:31,541
Bones thrown by Multi
National companies....

1795
01:53:31,749 --> 01:53:33,148
Are you saying we are dogs
to pick them up?

1796
01:53:33,851 --> 01:53:34,875
How dare you?

1797
01:53:35,086 --> 01:53:37,816
What's this? You hit me while
l was still talking...

1798
01:53:38,089 --> 01:53:42,890
l was about to say you're slaves waiting
for the bones thrown by the MNC's.

1799
01:53:43,094 --> 01:53:44,288
It's the same thing, Mr. Sivam.

1800
01:53:45,096 --> 01:53:46,563
What's that red thing flowing
out of your nose?

1801
01:53:46,764 --> 01:53:47,389
Blood?

1802
01:53:47,765 --> 01:53:48,629
One minute. l'll get you some tissue.

1803
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:50,897
No problem, leave it.
l like RED color.

1804
01:53:51,102 --> 01:53:53,627
Red is the color, l like most.

1805
01:53:53,838 --> 01:53:57,069
You're a mad man. You're bonker.
- You too.

1806
01:53:57,275 --> 01:53:59,402
This is what l don't want.
Avoid this provocation.

1807
01:53:59,610 --> 01:54:00,907
Will you prick on one's weak
spot continuously?

1808
01:54:01,112 --> 01:54:02,238
So, your nose is bleeding.

1809
01:54:02,847 --> 01:54:03,814
l'm sorry, okay.

1810
01:54:04,282 --> 01:54:05,749
Okay. Board the train.

1811
01:54:05,950 --> 01:54:07,577
Don't feel guilty.
- l'm not guilty.

1812
01:54:07,785 --> 01:54:09,412
l'm angry.- On me?

1813
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:12,248
Sorry, okay. No, l'm angry on myself.
l'm angry for getting angry.

1814
01:54:12,790 --> 01:54:14,257
Don't get angry often.
It's a disease.

1815
01:54:14,459 --> 01:54:15,585
Watch out, your eyes have
turned into Communist color.

1816
01:54:15,793 --> 01:54:16,919
l'll take care of them.
Leave it.

1817
01:54:17,295 --> 01:54:19,422
There's a way to stay cool.
Do you know that?

1818
01:54:19,630 --> 01:54:23,999
You mustn't insuIt me again.- No, it's a
good one, will you follow it?- What?

1819
01:54:24,302 --> 01:54:25,997
Do you believe in God?

1820
01:54:26,804 --> 01:54:29,602
lf you do, think of God in your mind.

1821
01:54:29,807 --> 01:54:31,536
Then? - Closing your eyes,

1822
01:54:32,143 --> 01:54:35,203
Count from 5 to 1 . Count down.

1823
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:36,105
lf l count down like that.

1824
01:54:36,314 --> 01:54:38,680
Okay. You do it...train will go away.
Try it once.

1825
01:54:44,188 --> 01:54:44,984
Jesus!

1826
01:54:54,499 --> 01:54:57,297
Where're you? You piece of shit.
Come out....You...

1827
01:54:59,837 --> 01:55:00,804
Open the door.

1828
01:55:01,005 --> 01:55:03,633
This is red, the color you like most.
Is it enough?

1829
01:55:03,841 --> 01:55:05,240
lsn't this anger?

1830
01:55:05,510 --> 01:55:08,240
How coolly and in a matured way
l showed my anger?

1831
01:55:08,846 --> 01:55:10,973
You punched my nose and
l punched your nose.

1832
01:55:11,182 --> 01:55:14,447
Accounts closed. Okay. We both had
bleeding noses. That's all.

1833
01:55:14,685 --> 01:55:15,811
Okay, open the door.

1834
01:55:16,287 --> 01:55:17,083
Okay.

1835
01:55:26,531 --> 01:55:28,726
Where's the mineral water bottle?
- Won't you wash with this water?

1836
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:30,667
To drink.

1837
01:55:31,202 --> 01:55:33,170
l bought a bottle for you.

1838
01:55:33,371 --> 01:55:34,736
Did you leave it behind?

1839
01:55:36,207 --> 01:55:37,504
Go and get it. Otherwise
train will move.

1840
01:55:38,075 --> 01:55:39,474
Please sir, it's paining.

1841
01:55:40,044 --> 01:55:40,840
Me?

1842
01:55:41,345 --> 01:55:42,573
lf you don't mind.

1843
01:56:05,136 --> 01:56:07,832
Come on, Mr. Sivam, hurry up.- Coming.

1844
01:56:08,539 --> 01:56:10,166
Hurry up...Hurry up...
Open the door.

1845
01:56:10,374 --> 01:56:11,341
Open the door.

1846
01:56:11,542 --> 01:56:12,668
l'm doing that only.
- l'm handicapped.

1847
01:56:12,877 --> 01:56:14,310
It's stuck. Oh! Door is jammed.

1848
01:56:14,712 --> 01:56:15,576
Open it quickly.

1849
01:56:16,881 --> 01:56:19,577
Okay! Try to open it without
getting tensed and angry.

1850
01:56:19,884 --> 01:56:21,681
Oh! Shouldn't l get angry?

1851
01:56:21,886 --> 01:56:23,183
What should l do to
control my anger?

1852
01:56:23,387 --> 01:56:24,854
Thinking about my favorite God
in my mind.

1853
01:56:25,056 --> 01:56:27,524
Closing my eyes.
Should l count down from 5 to 1?

1854
01:56:27,725 --> 01:56:29,192
But, train is moving forward.

1855
01:56:31,195 --> 01:56:33,026
Bye Mr. Sivam.

1856
01:56:33,230 --> 01:56:34,857
Sorry....sorry...
- It's alright.

1857
01:56:53,317 --> 01:56:54,784
l'm sorry...- it's alright.

1858
01:56:57,288 --> 01:56:58,255
Are you going to Chennai?

1859
01:57:09,767 --> 01:57:12,327
Listen, l'm sorry.
l don't lend my books.

1860
01:57:12,570 --> 01:57:14,765
l don't lend my books to others.

1861
01:57:19,810 --> 01:57:21,209
Oh! - Didn't get it?

1862
01:57:21,912 --> 01:57:22,970
l'll explain it in Tamil.

1863
01:57:23,581 --> 01:57:26,880
lf you give your book and
your girl friend...

1864
01:57:27,084 --> 01:57:29,109
They'll open the cover and ruin it.
That's the meaning.

1865
01:57:31,355 --> 01:57:32,379
l told that in God's own language.

1866
01:57:32,590 --> 01:57:34,387
You've forgotten God as well as
Sanskrit language.

1867
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:36,719
You know Sanskrit.
- l don't know.

1868
01:57:37,261 --> 01:57:39,229
l shouldn't lie with a
name of Uttaman(Good man in Tamil)

1869
01:57:39,430 --> 01:57:43,059
l know many things. Take it as,
l don't like advertisement.

1870
01:57:43,601 --> 01:57:44,898
Advertisement reminds me.

1871
01:57:45,102 --> 01:57:46,399
Do you know Ogilvy?

1872
01:57:47,104 --> 01:57:49,402
Father of the World of Advertisement.
- He's a great man...

1873
01:57:49,607 --> 01:57:50,164
That's...

1874
01:57:51,108 --> 01:57:55,568
He had proved that Man is
what he's wearing. l like this man.

1875
01:57:55,780 --> 01:57:57,077
Are you an Ad film maker?
- Of course.

1876
01:57:57,615 --> 01:57:58,411
l'm also an Ad film maker.

1877
01:57:58,616 --> 01:58:00,584
Of course, l don't know much
about that.

1878
01:58:00,951 --> 01:58:02,680
Then, Mahatma Gandhi is also my Guru.

1879
01:58:03,621 --> 01:58:04,246
lf you ask me, how's that?

1880
01:58:04,455 --> 01:58:04,921
You can take the same connotation.

1881
01:58:05,122 --> 01:58:05,588
Connotation.

1882
01:58:06,223 --> 01:58:07,747
Half Naked.

1883
01:58:07,992 --> 01:58:09,892
He had proved dress isn't important,
but the man is.

1884
01:58:10,127 --> 01:58:10,593
Yes.

1885
01:58:11,962 --> 01:58:13,759
What happened?
Am l talking too much today?

1886
01:58:14,065 --> 01:58:15,930
No, l like it, Mr. Uttaman.

1887
01:58:16,133 --> 01:58:20,001
It's such a great pleasure to meet you.
- Why?

1888
01:58:20,638 --> 01:58:25,439
l got stuck with a man from Bhubaneswar
to lchchapuram.

1889
01:58:25,643 --> 01:58:26,109
Is it?

1890
01:58:26,310 --> 01:58:28,107
l almost cracked while trying to take
him off my back.

1891
01:58:28,746 --> 01:58:31,544
You're what your company is.- Yeah!

1892
01:58:34,018 --> 01:58:37,010
Would you like some biscuits?
- No....No...

1893
01:58:37,221 --> 01:58:39,189
l'm sorry. l can't take this.
- Why?

1894
01:58:39,557 --> 01:58:43,459
l mean...l've heard about 'Biscuit Gangs'
looting passengers.

1895
01:58:43,661 --> 01:58:45,094
l don't want to take any risk.
- What?

1896
01:58:45,329 --> 01:58:47,957
Of course, l'm not blaming you..
- Did you buy them yourself?

1897
01:58:48,165 --> 01:58:50,395
That's....- So, you didn't
buy them yourself.- No.

1898
01:58:52,169 --> 01:58:53,602
What's this?
- l've saved your life.

1899
01:58:53,838 --> 01:58:55,066
You want a diversion now,
that's all, isn't it?

1900
01:58:56,173 --> 01:58:58,141
Whisky! It's not risky.

1901
01:58:58,342 --> 01:58:58,808
Hold this.

1902
01:58:59,009 --> 01:58:59,771
Have a shot, man.

1903
01:59:13,591 --> 01:59:17,152
Excuse me....Sir....sir.

1904
01:59:18,295 --> 01:59:19,785
Yeah....yeah...

1905
01:59:29,106 --> 01:59:32,132
Sir....Bag...- What?

1906
01:59:32,543 --> 01:59:37,446
My bag, suitcase, laptop
everything is missing.

1907
01:59:37,715 --> 01:59:38,841
Oh God! l don't know Telugu.

1908
01:59:39,049 --> 01:59:40,516
No problem, you can speak in Tamil.

1909
01:59:40,718 --> 01:59:42,345
All your baggage is missing.
- Yes, sir.

1910
01:59:42,553 --> 01:59:44,783
He has taken away baggage of
2 others along with yours.

1911
01:59:45,389 --> 01:59:47,516
Oh God! Who's that man, sir?

1912
01:59:47,725 --> 01:59:50,353
The man who was sitting here and
talking to you last night.

1913
01:59:50,761 --> 01:59:52,422
Who? Mr. Uttaman. - Yes.

1914
01:59:53,230 --> 01:59:54,197
How can you be so sure?

1915
01:59:54,398 --> 01:59:56,195
He's the lone man missing,
so surely he'll be the thief.

1916
01:59:56,534 --> 01:59:58,968
No Sir....no chance. No, sir. He's a very
decent man. No sir...no chance.

1917
01:59:59,403 --> 02:00:01,200
He was very fluent in
English and Sanskrit.

1918
02:00:01,405 --> 02:00:02,201
He was wearing suit and tie.

1919
02:00:02,406 --> 02:00:04,533
He would've stolen it from
people like you.

1920
02:00:04,975 --> 02:00:06,203
No, l don't believe this sir.

1921
02:00:06,577 --> 02:00:08,044
Will a man wearing suit and tie
be a gentleman by default?

1922
02:00:08,412 --> 02:00:09,879
Will a man wearing Home Spun cotton,
be a freedom fighter?

1923
02:00:13,083 --> 02:00:14,880
What's this, train has also
come to a halt?- Yes.

1924
02:00:15,085 --> 02:00:16,211
When will we reach Madras
if we travel like this?

1925
02:00:16,420 --> 02:00:17,546
lt'll take 2 days.

1926
02:00:18,255 --> 02:00:18,812
What?

1927
02:00:19,089 --> 02:00:23,048
The train which went before this has met
with an accident near Bapatla.

1928
02:00:23,260 --> 02:00:25,228
Many people are fighting
for their lives.

1929
02:00:25,429 --> 02:00:28,557
Till the route is cleared this train
will be here for 2 days.

1930
02:00:28,766 --> 02:00:29,892
l came to tell you.

1931
02:00:30,100 --> 02:00:31,567
lf you want to reach urgently,
travel by bus.

1932
02:01:45,009 --> 02:01:48,968
AB Negative blood is required
to save a life.

1933
02:01:51,181 --> 02:01:51,977
Your attention please.

1934
02:01:52,683 --> 02:01:56,813
AB Negative blood is required
to save a life.

1935
02:01:57,054 --> 02:01:59,682
We need AB negative blood
to save a life.

1936
02:01:59,890 --> 02:02:02,654
lf there's anyone with
AB Negative blood group,

1937
02:02:02,860 --> 02:02:03,656
Reach Medical camp immediately.

1938
02:02:03,861 --> 02:02:08,662
Hello, AB negative, my friend Mr.Aras,
AB negative donor. - Thank God!

1939
02:02:08,866 --> 02:02:10,834
Then, go immediately to Medical Camp
and donate blood.

1940
02:02:11,035 --> 02:02:14,300
You're AB negative?- No, l'm O positive,
already donated, sir.

1941
02:02:14,505 --> 02:02:16,564
Good. He's the first AB negative donor.
Come.

1942
02:02:17,207 --> 02:02:18,333
Did you see, you're the
first AB Negative donor.

1943
02:02:18,542 --> 02:02:21,670
l've a sick feeling about blood.
l feel like l'll throw up.

1944
02:02:21,879 --> 02:02:23,346
Only if you drink, isn't it?
- Oh, l hate blood.

1945
02:02:23,547 --> 02:02:25,014
lf you hate blood,
why don't you donate it?

1946
02:02:25,883 --> 02:02:27,510
No...please listen to me.
No...No...

1947
02:02:27,718 --> 02:02:28,184
Come....come...

1948
02:02:28,385 --> 02:02:30,182
Why're you ordering me?
Is it Russia to get ordered?

1949
02:02:30,387 --> 02:02:31,684
Why do you always drag Russia
for everything?

1950
02:02:31,889 --> 02:02:32,685
Why don't you leave me alone,
when l say l don't like it?

1951
02:02:32,890 --> 02:02:35,017
l don't like it. - Why?
- l'll help in some other way.

1952
02:02:35,225 --> 02:02:37,352
Why? - They'll inject my hand.

1953
02:02:37,661 --> 02:02:38,628
Just a prick.

1954
02:02:39,063 --> 02:02:42,692
Thief...thief...
A thief is running away.

1955
02:02:42,900 --> 02:02:45,630
Don't leave him.
Catch him....catch him.

1956
02:02:46,904 --> 02:02:47,700
Some thief, leave it.

1957
02:02:47,905 --> 02:02:49,372
He's not some thief.
He's Uttaman.

1958
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:52,708
Uttaman? Your friend?
- Thief Uttaman.

1959
02:02:53,410 --> 02:02:54,377
Bloody rogue! Where's he?

1960
02:02:54,578 --> 02:02:56,876
Mr. Pantulu.

1961
02:03:01,352 --> 02:03:03,047
Hi! - How're you?

1962
02:03:03,253 --> 02:03:05,050
Get up...- No...no.

1963
02:03:05,255 --> 02:03:06,722
They're local people,
if l get caught...

1964
02:03:06,924 --> 02:03:08,391
Hold him...

1965
02:03:09,593 --> 02:03:10,389
Oh, Why're you beating him?

1966
02:03:10,594 --> 02:03:11,993
Sorry....sorry.

1967
02:03:12,596 --> 02:03:15,394
You don't know about me?
Don't think l'm a saint.

1968
02:03:15,599 --> 02:03:18,067
l'm a killer...
l'm a natural born killer.

1969
02:03:18,602 --> 02:03:19,569
Why're you laughing at me?

1970
02:03:21,772 --> 02:03:22,670
Did you see that?

1971
02:03:23,440 --> 02:03:25,908
Are you an educated man?
You're behaving so violently!

1972
02:03:26,110 --> 02:03:27,805
Bloody thief! Are you really
an educated man?

1973
02:03:28,012 --> 02:03:29,741
l'm an illiterate. Leave it aside.

1974
02:03:29,947 --> 02:03:30,572
You're calling me a thief.

1975
02:03:30,948 --> 02:03:33,576
l searched your entire baggage and
didn't find a penny in it.

1976
02:03:33,784 --> 02:03:35,183
How can a thief survive like this?

1977
02:03:35,386 --> 02:03:36,580
Don't embarrass me without
knowing my predicament.

1978
02:03:37,121 --> 02:03:38,816
l had money. You know it, don't you?

1979
02:03:39,189 --> 02:03:40,588
Tell him, l lost all my money.

1980
02:03:41,358 --> 02:03:42,416
What are you laughing at? Shut up.

1981
02:03:42,626 --> 02:03:43,422
You go on laughing, sir.

1982
02:03:43,627 --> 02:03:44,423
Who's he to stop you?

1983
02:03:44,628 --> 02:03:46,596
That's his problem.
- My problem?

1984
02:03:46,797 --> 02:03:48,025
lf l hit you, all your teeth
will roll out. - Wait.

1985
02:03:48,232 --> 02:03:48,857
Where's my bag?

1986
02:03:49,066 --> 02:03:49,862
Don't shout.

1987
02:03:50,300 --> 02:03:54,600
Mr.Pantulu, give his bag to him and
collect Rs.10 from him.

1988
02:03:54,805 --> 02:03:55,271
My bag....my bag.

1989
02:03:55,472 --> 02:03:57,099
Give him Rs.10. l don't know
whether you have it or not.

1990
02:03:57,474 --> 02:03:59,442
All of you pay him Rs.10 each
and take your bags.

1991
02:04:01,979 --> 02:04:02,604
Who's that?

1992
02:04:04,982 --> 02:04:05,448
Who's that?

1993
02:04:06,984 --> 02:04:07,780
Take the glass.

1994
02:04:08,185 --> 02:04:08,981
Take it.

1995
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:12,117
Oh! You? A Tamilian?

1996
02:04:12,423 --> 02:04:13,287
So, you betrayed me.

1997
02:04:13,724 --> 02:04:15,021
Why don't you take me
to a Police station?

1998
02:04:15,359 --> 02:04:18,260
Take me to the police station.

1999
02:04:18,495 --> 02:04:20,793
Sir, why're you getting angry?
- What do you want?

2000
02:04:21,331 --> 02:04:22,628
You've a long life.

2001
02:04:26,336 --> 02:04:27,303
l'm sorry, Mr. Sivam.

2002
02:04:27,504 --> 02:04:29,301
l left you behind in the station.

2003
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:31,705
Till now, no one has hit me on
my nose like that.

2004
02:04:32,009 --> 02:04:33,306
Sorry. - l'm the only child.

2005
02:04:33,844 --> 02:04:35,709
My parents had 2 sons
but l'm their only son.

2006
02:04:36,180 --> 02:04:36,805
How's that?

2007
02:04:37,347 --> 02:04:39,406
My elder brother died young.

2008
02:04:40,851 --> 02:04:41,749
While playing cricket when
he was young.

2009
02:04:42,186 --> 02:04:44,381
Cricket ball hit his eye...
in the hospital...

2010
02:04:44,822 --> 02:04:46,050
Ever since then, on seeing blood...

2011
02:04:47,357 --> 02:04:48,517
Oh! Shit!

2012
02:04:51,728 --> 02:04:53,593
You're alright?
- No, l'm not alright.

2013
02:04:54,198 --> 02:04:56,496
Since then, l've great aversion for
hospitaIs and ambulances.

2014
02:04:57,267 --> 02:04:57,824
That's alright.

2015
02:04:59,303 --> 02:05:01,897
How did you reach this place?

2016
02:05:02,806 --> 02:05:05,001
lf l tell, you'll say you feel
like vomiting and giddy.

2017
02:05:05,309 --> 02:05:07,334
l came in an ambulance
carrying blood.

2018
02:05:09,513 --> 02:05:11,879
l've many doctors and nurses as friends.

2019
02:05:12,883 --> 02:05:14,680
Look, you've friends all
over the world.

2020
02:05:15,319 --> 02:05:16,684
l'm confused as to whom
l should believe?

2021
02:05:17,554 --> 02:05:18,020
The man l met...

2022
02:05:19,389 --> 02:05:21,880
Now, man has become a cannibal.

2023
02:05:24,061 --> 02:05:24,925
l'm also hungry.

2024
02:05:26,563 --> 02:05:28,861
l threw away the biscuits you bought
for me, on that cheat's advise.

2025
02:05:29,666 --> 02:05:31,031
But, one thing Mr. Sivam.

2026
02:05:32,569 --> 02:05:35,094
Appearances are deceptive.

2027
02:05:36,907 --> 02:05:38,374
This is what l had told
you at Airport.

2028
02:05:39,076 --> 02:05:43,706
There's no need for a terrorist
to appear ugly.

2029
02:05:43,914 --> 02:05:45,711
He can look handsome....
- Like me.

2030
02:05:47,084 --> 02:05:49,780
Likewise, there is no need for a good man
to look handsome.

2031
02:05:50,420 --> 02:05:50,977
He might look...

2032
02:05:51,421 --> 02:05:55,824
With an ugly face,
something like you.

2033
02:05:57,594 --> 02:06:00,188
How's that you're able to laugh for
everything?- l feel like that.

2034
02:06:00,597 --> 02:06:01,564
But, l don't feel like that.

2035
02:06:01,765 --> 02:06:03,062
You'll also be able to.
Try it once.

2036
02:06:04,935 --> 02:06:06,903
l feel nervous and scared
for everything.

2037
02:06:08,438 --> 02:06:09,666
l had a feeling that
l know everything.

2038
02:06:10,174 --> 02:06:11,072
But, l am ignorant.

2039
02:06:13,110 --> 02:06:14,543
l'm useless, sir.

2040
02:06:15,112 --> 02:06:15,908
Why do you say like that?

2041
02:06:16,113 --> 02:06:18,411
Don't be like that. Be positive.

2042
02:06:18,782 --> 02:06:20,409
You're an AB Negative.

2043
02:06:21,218 --> 02:06:22,378
But be positive.

2044
02:06:23,287 --> 02:06:24,549
Now, you lost your baggage.

2045
02:06:25,756 --> 02:06:27,917
Hi Nalla, what a surprise!

2046
02:06:28,192 --> 02:06:31,025
Nice to see you.
Come....come.

2047
02:06:31,228 --> 02:06:34,356
My Goodness. God bless you.
You're okay?

2048
02:06:34,565 --> 02:06:36,032
You're looking handsome.

2049
02:06:36,833 --> 02:06:38,300
He's handsome.
- Come....come.

2050
02:06:38,535 --> 02:06:39,661
She's Sr. Venessa.

2051
02:06:40,003 --> 02:06:41,334
She had only saved my life and made
my face handsome like this.

2052
02:06:41,538 --> 02:06:42,402
Shut up.

2053
02:06:43,373 --> 02:06:46,968
This is Aras, my friend. AB negative.
- AB negative?

2054
02:06:47,177 --> 02:06:48,007
Thank God.

2055
02:06:48,212 --> 02:06:50,043
We need your blood to save a life.

2056
02:06:51,381 --> 02:06:53,008
Is he Tamil? - Yes.

2057
02:06:53,417 --> 02:06:55,385
A boy's life must be saved.

2058
02:06:55,619 --> 02:06:57,587
l understand English.
But, l've a problem, you see.

2059
02:06:57,788 --> 02:06:59,278
Do you've jaundice?
- No....No.

2060
02:06:59,489 --> 02:07:00,478
Tetanus. - No.

2061
02:07:00,724 --> 02:07:01,656
Nervous? - Yes.

2062
02:07:01,858 --> 02:07:03,416
Such a big man like you
to be nervous.

2063
02:07:03,627 --> 02:07:06,152
Come on...- No. You can't compel me.
l don't want to go.

2064
02:07:06,363 --> 02:07:06,829
What?

2065
02:07:07,197 --> 02:07:08,061
For your betterment only.

2066
02:07:08,265 --> 02:07:09,926
l'm not compelling you to come with me.
- Yeah!

2067
02:07:10,133 --> 02:07:12,499
But, l want you to see
what you can do. - No.

2068
02:07:12,703 --> 02:07:14,500
She says you'll change your
mind if you meet that boy.

2069
02:07:14,838 --> 02:07:17,739
Listen...Hello....Hello....sir....Sir...Stop.

2070
02:07:18,842 --> 02:07:21,402
Sister, this is emotional black mailing.
You listen to me.

2071
02:07:26,216 --> 02:07:29,583
ln 20 minutes this boy
is going to die.

2072
02:07:30,120 --> 02:07:32,213
lf we get blood, we can
save his life.

2073
02:07:32,456 --> 02:07:33,787
It's up to you now.

2074
02:07:55,612 --> 02:07:56,510
Take my blood.

2075
02:07:57,581 --> 02:07:59,208
Wait. Are they going
to crucify you?

2076
02:07:59,750 --> 02:08:00,216
Come.

2077
02:08:00,917 --> 02:08:01,884
What should l do now?

2078
02:08:02,085 --> 02:08:03,052
Sleep on this bed.

2079
02:08:03,587 --> 02:08:04,053
Sleep.

2080
02:08:05,055 --> 02:08:05,544
Shoe?

2081
02:08:05,756 --> 02:08:06,552
You can wear shoes.

2082
02:08:08,158 --> 02:08:12,618
Mr. Sivam, a human body has about
5.5 liters of blood.

2083
02:08:13,597 --> 02:08:16,327
Now, they'll take only a small
quantity of blood, won't they?

2084
02:08:16,533 --> 02:08:18,057
Don't worry, my son.

2085
02:08:18,368 --> 02:08:21,462
We'll not kill one man
to save another man.

2086
02:08:21,838 --> 02:08:25,604
Promise. - Yeah! l trust you.
No problem at all.

2087
02:08:27,711 --> 02:08:28,939
What's that, it's too sharp?

2088
02:08:29,346 --> 02:08:31,405
Okay. They have to prick, isn't it?

2089
02:08:31,615 --> 02:08:34,709
l've to go to a function in Chennai
urgently to meet my fiancee.

2090
02:08:34,918 --> 02:08:38,410
Don't worry.
You'll function very well.

2091
02:08:58,308 --> 02:08:58,774
What?

2092
02:08:59,643 --> 02:09:01,941
Can't they go without the siren?

2093
02:09:03,480 --> 02:09:05,004
An Ambulance will always
have a siren.

2094
02:09:05,315 --> 02:09:06,942
We'll get a clear road only if the
siren is switched on.

2095
02:09:07,317 --> 02:09:10,115
It has been going on since ages.
We can't change it now.

2096
02:09:14,091 --> 02:09:14,614
What happened?

2097
02:09:16,993 --> 02:09:18,961
Son....son.

2098
02:09:19,396 --> 02:09:20,522
Tell me, what's your name?

2099
02:09:21,665 --> 02:09:22,859
Look, uncle is asking you.

2100
02:09:23,066 --> 02:09:24,124
l didn't ask.

2101
02:09:25,335 --> 02:09:25,858
Tell him.

2102
02:09:26,737 --> 02:09:29,865
Paunraj...

2103
02:09:32,909 --> 02:09:34,137
Paun again.

2104
02:09:43,653 --> 02:09:46,486
Nothing, l had an old friend...
....have a friend.

2105
02:09:50,527 --> 02:09:54,327
Watch....watch....- Watch.

2106
02:09:54,531 --> 02:09:55,156
l got it.

2107
02:09:55,532 --> 02:09:58,330
Watch? Did you lose it
in the accident?

2108
02:09:58,935 --> 02:10:00,903
Some thief might have stolen it.
- Shall l give my watch?

2109
02:10:02,472 --> 02:10:04,064
You've come back alive.
That's great news.

2110
02:10:04,541 --> 02:10:06,839
Forget about the watch.
We'll buy a new one at Chennai.

2111
02:10:07,043 --> 02:10:07,839
l want to talk.

2112
02:10:10,814 --> 02:10:11,803
Excuse me.

2113
02:10:13,383 --> 02:10:14,077
What else do you want?

2114
02:10:14,951 --> 02:10:16,179
Rubber ball.

2115
02:10:18,054 --> 02:10:19,021
It seems he wants a rubber ball.

2116
02:10:24,294 --> 02:10:26,626
Oh God! Driver be careful.
- Sorry madam.

2117
02:10:26,830 --> 02:10:29,731
Sister, he had been driving
all day and night.

2118
02:10:30,100 --> 02:10:33,194
Driver, stop at some good place,
we'll have tea and proceed.

2119
02:10:41,244 --> 02:10:43,007
Sir, where's Mr. A.Aras?

2120
02:10:43,914 --> 02:10:45,040
He has gone to the shop
to buy a ball.

2121
02:10:45,582 --> 02:10:48,050
Order 2 strong teas for us.
l'll go and...

2122
02:10:49,419 --> 02:10:50,044
Wait...wait.

2123
02:10:51,421 --> 02:10:52,285
lmportant paper.
- Your bag is torn.

2124
02:10:53,557 --> 02:10:54,922
Thanks.- Okay.

2125
02:10:56,693 --> 02:10:57,887
Okay....okay.

2126
02:10:58,094 --> 02:11:00,062
l'm in the outskirts. l'll come.

2127
02:11:00,797 --> 02:11:02,424
Yeah! okay...bye.

2128
02:11:03,467 --> 02:11:04,434
A small request.

2129
02:11:04,868 --> 02:11:06,733
l was about to spoil
all my efforts.

2130
02:11:07,003 --> 02:11:09,164
l threw off the cheque for
Rs.32 lakhs in the slush.

2131
02:11:09,372 --> 02:11:10,066
My bag is torn.

2132
02:11:10,273 --> 02:11:11,399
It's damaged like me.

2133
02:11:11,708 --> 02:11:14,575
Keep it safely in your bag. l'll take
it back in Chennai. - Okay, no problem.

2134
02:11:14,778 --> 02:11:16,302
Give that ball also.

2135
02:11:16,980 --> 02:11:18,072
Take it.

2136
02:11:18,281 --> 02:11:18,747
Thank you.

2137
02:11:18,949 --> 02:11:20,314
Where's the money for it?
l too don't have any money.

2138
02:11:21,351 --> 02:11:22,318
Now, you're in my territory.

2139
02:11:27,457 --> 02:11:28,719
Would you like to call your
family on phone?

2140
02:11:29,259 --> 02:11:29,748
No.

2141
02:11:30,093 --> 02:11:30,752
Don't worry.

2142
02:11:30,961 --> 02:11:31,859
l owe you one call.

2143
02:11:32,462 --> 02:11:36,762
Only newly married man needs to call
his wife to bolster her confidence.

2144
02:11:36,967 --> 02:11:38,161
l'm married for a long time.

2145
02:11:39,035 --> 02:11:39,967
You've children?

2146
02:11:41,004 --> 02:11:41,698
Yeah! - Yeah!

2147
02:11:42,138 --> 02:11:42,604
How many?

2148
02:11:43,707 --> 02:11:44,469
1 son.

2149
02:11:45,475 --> 02:11:45,941
What's his name?

2150
02:11:46,810 --> 02:11:51,406
Sangu, Sankaran...- Sangu? Why don't
you buy something for Sangu?

2151
02:11:52,315 --> 02:11:53,714
No....No...l want to buy him something.
Some chocolates.

2152
02:11:53,917 --> 02:11:57,876
No... Buy a similar ball,
that's enough.

2153
02:11:58,154 --> 02:11:59,621
Are you sure? - Yeah!
- Another ball please.

2154
02:11:59,823 --> 02:12:01,450
He likes to play with a ball.

2155
02:12:01,825 --> 02:12:02,792
Put this ball into the bag.

2156
02:12:02,993 --> 02:12:03,618
This is for you.

2157
02:12:04,327 --> 02:12:04,884
That's for you.

2158
02:12:05,996 --> 02:12:08,556
Doctor....Doctor...

2159
02:12:10,433 --> 02:12:11,525
Palpitations!

2160
02:12:27,851 --> 02:12:28,317
What happened?

2161
02:12:29,286 --> 02:12:30,480
Please go away.

2162
02:12:31,021 --> 02:12:33,080
Please be careful.
- Nalla...

2163
02:12:35,425 --> 02:12:35,982
He's pressing...pressing hard.

2164
02:12:36,526 --> 02:12:36,992
Pressing.

2165
02:12:37,761 --> 02:12:38,819
Hey, slowly.

2166
02:13:17,734 --> 02:13:18,701
l asked, would you like
to have tea?

2167
02:14:13,623 --> 02:14:14,248
What's all this?

2168
02:14:15,792 --> 02:14:16,417
l'm not able to understand.

2169
02:14:18,294 --> 02:14:19,261
What's all this design?

2170
02:14:20,563 --> 02:14:21,587
Derailing a train.

2171
02:14:22,098 --> 02:14:23,429
Getting a boy wounded in it.

2172
02:14:23,633 --> 02:14:24,930
Taking him to the brink of death.

2173
02:14:25,669 --> 02:14:27,967
Then, suddenly helping him to
get a rare blood group.

2174
02:14:29,205 --> 02:14:30,103
Saving his life.

2175
02:14:31,741 --> 02:14:34,266
What's all this tyranny to
kill him on the way?

2176
02:14:37,814 --> 02:14:38,781
What sort of a God are you?

2177
02:14:41,084 --> 02:14:44,178
ln fact, in such situations only belief
in the existence of God gets shaken.

2178
02:14:46,823 --> 02:14:47,289
No.

2179
02:14:48,425 --> 02:14:49,289
l'm sorry.

2180
02:14:50,827 --> 02:14:51,452
Unlike you,

2181
02:14:51,995 --> 02:14:52,962
l believe in God.

2182
02:14:55,498 --> 02:14:57,466
Who said, l don't believe in God.

2183
02:15:01,771 --> 02:15:04,535
Oh! Have you suddenly become a theist?

2184
02:15:06,976 --> 02:15:07,806
l'm a theist since a long time.

2185
02:15:10,513 --> 02:15:11,138
Who's that God?

2186
02:15:19,723 --> 02:15:24,251
Look, l don't understand your jokes, man
- Because, it's not a joke.

2187
02:15:24,894 --> 02:15:28,523
The heart that sheds tears
for a stranger.

2188
02:15:29,532 --> 02:15:30,191
That is God.

2189
02:15:36,806 --> 02:15:37,568
Thank you.

2190
02:15:41,144 --> 02:15:42,168
Why're you so merciful on me suddenly?

2191
02:15:43,713 --> 02:15:44,680
Because, l'm also a God.

2192
02:15:45,815 --> 02:15:47,840
l know it. There must be some hook.

2193
02:15:50,987 --> 02:15:52,386
Okay. Who said you're a God?

2194
02:15:53,890 --> 02:15:56,085
A woman petty shop keeper
on a mountain said so.

2195
02:15:56,292 --> 02:15:57,259
l started believing it from that day.

2196
02:15:59,062 --> 02:15:59,687
Didn't get it, isn't it?

2197
02:16:02,065 --> 02:16:03,191
You mustn't understand.
That's God.

2198
02:16:08,638 --> 02:16:13,268
A. Aras, you're a good man.

2199
02:16:17,447 --> 02:16:19,415
So are you? - l know.

2200
02:16:22,519 --> 02:16:24,578
You're a last word freak.

2201
02:16:26,523 --> 02:16:31,586
Who's God?

2202
02:16:36,366 --> 02:16:42,532
You and me are Gods.

2203
02:16:49,078 --> 02:16:54,414
Life is a penance.

2204
02:16:55,451 --> 02:17:01,287
Love is God.

2205
02:17:01,891 --> 02:17:04,860
lf heart is just a piece of flesh.

2206
02:17:05,061 --> 02:17:08,053
Fire will consume it.

2207
02:17:08,264 --> 02:17:14,464
lf it's a tool of Love,
it'll win over death.

2208
02:17:14,671 --> 02:17:27,641
Let's all join together and say
in one voice, Love is God.

2209
02:18:07,023 --> 02:18:08,217
Excuse me. - Yes.

2210
02:18:08,958 --> 02:18:10,186
Is it house No:16? - Correct.

2211
02:18:11,594 --> 02:18:12,925
Is Mr. Sivam there?

2212
02:18:13,329 --> 02:18:14,694
There's no Sivam here.

2213
02:18:15,231 --> 02:18:18,029
l mean Mr. Sivam....thick set glasses...
Disfigured face.

2214
02:18:18,501 --> 02:18:20,128
Oh! Our Nalla! - Who?

2215
02:18:20,336 --> 02:18:22,930
Nalla's full name is Nallasivam.
- Yes.

2216
02:18:23,139 --> 02:18:23,969
What do you want?

2217
02:18:24,641 --> 02:18:26,074
Mr. Sivam's check is with me....

2218
02:18:26,276 --> 02:18:28,301
Are you Mr.Aras? - Yes.

2219
02:18:28,511 --> 02:18:30,638
Oh! He has gone out to
call you.

2220
02:18:30,847 --> 02:18:32,747
Thank God! You've come with the check.

2221
02:18:33,283 --> 02:18:35,217
Here. Your cheque has come.
Don't worry anymore.

2222
02:18:35,418 --> 02:18:38,285
Has our check come?

2223
02:18:38,488 --> 02:18:39,750
Have you all given your names?
- Yes.

2224
02:18:39,989 --> 02:18:41,547
All affected people will
get money.

2225
02:18:41,791 --> 02:18:42,985
He's now responsible for
getting this money.

2226
02:18:43,192 --> 02:18:43,886
Thank you, sir.

2227
02:18:44,027 --> 02:18:46,791
Thank you very much sir.
l'm not able to get up.

2228
02:18:47,063 --> 02:18:49,691
Please forgive me, sir.
- No problem.

2229
02:18:50,133 --> 02:18:51,327
Greetings sir.

2230
02:18:51,734 --> 02:18:55,295
The help you've done to us,
l can never forget all my life.

2231
02:18:55,505 --> 02:18:59,271
l sincerely bless you and your
family to lead a happy life.

2232
02:18:59,475 --> 02:19:00,567
l'll take leave son.

2233
02:19:03,980 --> 02:19:05,914
You've given us a new life.
- Oh God, please get up.

2234
02:19:06,115 --> 02:19:08,310
My daughter's marriage is due to
your benevolence. - Oh No! Get up.

2235
02:19:08,518 --> 02:19:10,611
l didn't do anything.
Mr.Sivam did everything.

2236
02:19:10,820 --> 02:19:11,809
Anyway, if you live happily,
that's enough.

2237
02:19:12,021 --> 02:19:14,819
Get it signed and
deposit it in the bank.

2238
02:19:15,058 --> 02:19:16,719
lmmediately.- Sir, Excuse me.

2239
02:19:17,560 --> 02:19:21,189
Mr. Sivam told, he resides
at house no:16.

2240
02:19:21,664 --> 02:19:22,995
lf he comes here,
he'll stay here only.

2241
02:19:23,967 --> 02:19:24,763
lf he comes?

2242
02:19:25,501 --> 02:19:28,197
Then, what about his wife and son?

2243
02:19:28,972 --> 02:19:30,963
His wife and son?

2244
02:19:31,808 --> 02:19:33,002
He doesn't have anyone.

2245
02:19:33,209 --> 02:19:34,938
No....No...He said he has a son.

2246
02:19:35,144 --> 02:19:39,080
He has a son. He said his name
is Sankaran...Sangu.

2247
02:19:40,717 --> 02:19:42,378
Did he say Sangu is his son?
- Yes.

2248
02:19:42,785 --> 02:19:44,082
ln a way, he's right.

2249
02:19:44,287 --> 02:19:46,084
He's here.
He's Sangu.

2250
02:20:16,652 --> 02:20:20,520
Sangu, got bored with the ball,
have you come here hopping?

2251
02:20:24,527 --> 02:20:27,121
Come. l was calling you
only on the phone.

2252
02:20:27,330 --> 02:20:28,558
That cheque was in your bag.

2253
02:20:28,765 --> 02:20:29,857
l gave the cheque.

2254
02:20:33,436 --> 02:20:34,562
Did you go to the Union Office?

2255
02:20:34,771 --> 02:20:37,934
Yes, l went there thinking it
was your residence.

2256
02:20:39,976 --> 02:20:40,908
Is he your son?

2257
02:20:49,452 --> 02:20:50,146
Wife?

2258
02:20:54,624 --> 02:20:55,989
That's not a total lie.

2259
02:20:56,359 --> 02:20:58,725
May be l had someone like
him in my heart.

2260
02:20:58,928 --> 02:20:59,758
Leave it.

2261
02:21:03,166 --> 02:21:04,030
Is she dead?

2262
02:21:08,704 --> 02:21:09,830
Still not yet born.

2263
02:21:14,077 --> 02:21:14,736
Nice.

2264
02:21:18,014 --> 02:21:21,950
The truth is, l don't have any
near relation.

2265
02:21:22,151 --> 02:21:24,517
Everyone has a complex.

2266
02:21:24,720 --> 02:21:28,121
l've a complex that l don't
have a wife.

2267
02:21:28,324 --> 02:21:34,957
Am l not wearing a platform shoe to
adjust my leg which is short?

2268
02:21:35,164 --> 02:21:38,861
My wife is....
lmaginary walking stick.

2269
02:21:39,402 --> 02:21:40,994
l shouldn't get dejected in life,
should l?

2270
02:21:46,609 --> 02:21:49,009
Okay, get into the car.

2271
02:21:51,280 --> 02:21:51,837
Why?

2272
02:21:54,016 --> 02:21:55,574
Because, l'm getting married today.

2273
02:21:57,053 --> 02:21:59,817
l know that, l'll come later
in the evening.

2274
02:21:59,889 --> 02:22:01,220
No! Now...

2275
02:22:02,592 --> 02:22:05,220
Why're you threatening me now?
Why should l come now?

2276
02:22:07,563 --> 02:22:10,088
Because, l'm a God!
l'm ordering you.

2277
02:22:10,566 --> 02:22:11,362
Get into the car.

2278
02:22:13,402 --> 02:22:16,269
l'm also a God. l'm also saying
l'll come later.

2279
02:22:19,308 --> 02:22:21,776
Sangu, get down...down...- No, stay.

2280
02:22:26,749 --> 02:22:28,717
Can't you understand the feeling
which the dog had understood?

2281
02:22:30,820 --> 02:22:32,811
Dog, written backwards becomes GOD.

2282
02:22:35,091 --> 02:22:37,321
Why do you always torture me
by your arguments?

2283
02:22:41,097 --> 02:22:44,294
l too don't have anyone.
No sisters, brothers.

2284
02:22:44,800 --> 02:22:45,789
l had a brother.

2285
02:22:48,137 --> 02:22:49,434
ln my young age itself, l lost him.

2286
02:22:52,575 --> 02:22:54,543
He died getting hit by a cricket ball.

2287
02:22:55,211 --> 02:22:55,677
l've told...

2288
02:22:55,878 --> 02:22:59,370
l already told you all this man.
- Yeah. Sorry.

2289
02:23:03,186 --> 02:23:04,676
l've got back my brother again...

2290
02:23:07,323 --> 02:23:10,656
Yeah! okay. - Yeah!

2291
02:23:11,861 --> 02:23:15,160
You must always be with me.
...All my life.

2292
02:23:25,374 --> 02:23:28,241
Why didn't you tell me all
this earlier?

2293
02:23:28,811 --> 02:23:31,678
Why didn't l? l was little shy.
Now, l'm not.

2294
02:23:32,515 --> 02:23:34,608
Is it love to go on repeating?

2295
02:23:34,884 --> 02:23:36,078
You should understand, man.

2296
02:23:36,886 --> 02:23:38,080
Now, you're getting into the car.

2297
02:23:49,765 --> 02:23:52,097
You're a mad man.

2298
02:24:05,348 --> 02:24:07,680
What's this?
What's all this adventure?

2299
02:24:08,484 --> 02:24:12,716
You gave us anxious moments
with floods backdrop.

2300
02:24:12,955 --> 02:24:14,684
l've come back, haven't l?
It's all over.

2301
02:24:15,424 --> 02:24:17,324
He's the man responsible for
my coming here safely.- Thank you.

2302
02:24:18,094 --> 02:24:19,891
lf he hadn't been there, everything
would've been delayed.

2303
02:24:20,096 --> 02:24:22,656
We would've been in trouble had we not
found a marriage hall.- Thanks brother.

2304
02:24:22,865 --> 02:24:23,957
Not younger, elder brother.

2305
02:24:24,166 --> 02:24:25,098
Not you...me.

2306
02:24:25,301 --> 02:24:27,166
Elder brother? Didn't get it?
- Didn't get it?

2307
02:24:27,370 --> 02:24:28,803
l'm a God. You understood
this at least?

2308
02:24:29,272 --> 02:24:30,136
No, l didn't get this also.
- You won't get this also.

2309
02:24:30,339 --> 02:24:32,239
You are all Gods. l'll explain
to you later.

2310
02:24:32,441 --> 02:24:33,567
Can l have some coffee, please?

2311
02:24:33,776 --> 02:24:35,073
Uncle, what are those marks
on your face?

2312
02:24:35,278 --> 02:24:36,575
Child, you mustn't ask that.

2313
02:24:36,779 --> 02:24:40,545
No problem. - She can ask.
He has an answer for every question.

2314
02:24:40,750 --> 02:24:44,846
l went to a barber's shop for a shave in Gujarat.

2315
02:24:45,054 --> 02:24:46,817
An earthquake hit at that time.

2316
02:24:47,690 --> 02:24:49,817
What happened after that, uncle?
- Hi Saras, how're you?

2317
02:24:50,726 --> 02:24:51,784
l've come back, haven't l?

2318
02:24:52,962 --> 02:24:55,453
My phone is not working.
l'm calling from my uncle's cell phone.

2319
02:24:56,065 --> 02:24:56,656
Yes.

2320
02:24:57,566 --> 02:24:59,261
Okay, when shall we meet?

2321
02:25:00,536 --> 02:25:01,264
Oh my God!

2322
02:25:01,771 --> 02:25:02,669
Okay...okay.

2323
02:25:03,205 --> 02:25:05,036
Madam is very angry.
- Won't she be?

2324
02:25:05,241 --> 02:25:06,868
Would you do me a small favor?
- What favor?

2325
02:25:07,076 --> 02:25:09,704
Give this letter....
- Love letter? - Yes.

2326
02:25:09,912 --> 02:25:10,936
l wrote it in Bhubaneswar.
- Come...

2327
02:25:11,147 --> 02:25:14,913
Through this, you're cajoling her by
narrating a dramatic story.- Okay.

2328
02:25:15,117 --> 02:25:17,517
Not only that, you're changing your
dress also. - This is good, isn't it?

2329
02:25:17,720 --> 02:25:18,982
This God didn't like it, okay?

2330
02:25:19,188 --> 02:25:21,156
Not only that, you're groom's friend.
So, hurry up.

2331
02:25:23,125 --> 02:25:24,683
Bride's people are staying that side.

2332
02:25:24,794 --> 02:25:26,318
Okay. You carry on.

2333
02:26:35,064 --> 02:26:37,862
Bloody rogue! Why've you come here?

2334
02:26:41,137 --> 02:26:43,662
Don't allow anyone in. Keep a vigil.
- Okay, boss.

2335
02:26:47,943 --> 02:26:51,208
Is this your daughter's second marriage?
- Hey, don't talk.

2336
02:26:51,781 --> 02:26:53,578
Before anyone sees you, go away from
this side. Go away.

2337
02:26:54,417 --> 02:26:57,215
It's wrong to misbehave like
this with groom's people.

2338
02:26:57,420 --> 02:27:00,912
Do you know the consequences if
Anbarasu comes to know about this?

2339
02:27:01,357 --> 02:27:03,689
How do you know the groom?

2340
02:27:03,893 --> 02:27:04,882
Calling me disrespectfully.

2341
02:27:06,061 --> 02:27:09,053
How do you know the groom, sir?

2342
02:27:09,865 --> 02:27:11,093
He's like my younger brother.

2343
02:27:14,470 --> 02:27:15,494
Okay, forget it.

2344
02:27:15,938 --> 02:27:18,099
Tell me, what do you
expect from me?

2345
02:27:21,177 --> 02:27:22,735
It's getting late. Where's the boss?
- He's discussing inside.

2346
02:27:22,945 --> 02:27:24,071
He has ordered not to allow
anyone inside.

2347
02:27:24,280 --> 02:27:25,747
Go....move away.

2348
02:27:26,282 --> 02:27:27,544
l fall at your feet.
- Oh No!

2349
02:27:27,750 --> 02:27:31,186
Oh God! Why're you falling at his feet?
- Close the door, man. Go.

2350
02:27:32,455 --> 02:27:33,422
Is it enough?

2351
02:27:33,856 --> 02:27:35,483
l never asked for this.

2352
02:27:35,958 --> 02:27:38,051
Okay. Order me.
l'm ready to do anything.

2353
02:27:39,228 --> 02:27:44,530
l want to meet Bala.
- No...no way. You can't meet Bala.

2354
02:27:44,867 --> 02:27:46,892
Why not? l can walk up to her.

2355
02:27:47,102 --> 02:27:49,593
Am l a 10./. living dead man?

2356
02:27:49,972 --> 02:27:52,338
Unnecessarily, don't interfere.

2357
02:27:53,042 --> 02:27:54,737
Tell me. - You do one thing.

2358
02:27:55,077 --> 02:27:56,408
Sit in a corner and meditate.

2359
02:27:56,612 --> 02:27:58,011
Let me see, if your Lord Siva will
dare to stop me.

2360
02:27:58,214 --> 02:28:01,012
l feel it's my chance now to
grant you a boon.

2361
02:28:03,986 --> 02:28:05,681
You love Bala, don't you?

2362
02:28:07,690 --> 02:28:09,351
Forgive me for her sake
and grant me a boon.

2363
02:28:09,558 --> 02:28:11,185
How can l grant a boon?

2364
02:28:11,393 --> 02:28:14,521
You lied to me that Bala is
married and pregnant.

2365
02:28:14,730 --> 02:28:17,392
You lied to Bala that l'm dead.

2366
02:28:17,733 --> 02:28:20,531
You had cheated your daughter Bala.
- God promise...

2367
02:28:20,736 --> 02:28:22,169
Why do you unnecessarily
drag God into it?

2368
02:28:22,738 --> 02:28:25,298
Did you ever wait in a
queue to pray God?

2369
02:28:25,508 --> 02:28:29,467
You'll always jump queues.

2370
02:28:29,945 --> 02:28:32,607
You'll commit all sins and
donate liberally.

2371
02:28:32,815 --> 02:28:35,511
God will forgive all your sins
and save you, won't he?

2372
02:28:36,185 --> 02:28:37,948
A God saving you like that
is not at all a God.

2373
02:28:38,454 --> 02:28:39,045
He's just a coolie.

2374
02:28:39,722 --> 02:28:42,122
Because, he's also taking
money to do a job.

2375
02:28:44,093 --> 02:28:45,492
l've understood. - What?

2376
02:28:45,694 --> 02:28:48,390
Cash....Hot cash... You want only that, right?

2377
02:28:48,631 --> 02:28:51,099
You quote it, l'll settle
it here itself.

2378
02:28:54,336 --> 02:28:55,997
l don't want it in one go.

2379
02:28:57,039 --> 02:29:00,008
Send it to me every month.
- Why?

2380
02:29:00,209 --> 02:29:01,141
Forgot?

2381
02:29:01,343 --> 02:29:02,469
910!

2382
02:29:02,912 --> 02:29:04,675
That's workers' problem.

2383
02:29:04,914 --> 02:29:07,849
What's your need?
Tell me, what do you expect from me?

2384
02:29:08,250 --> 02:29:10,514
Let their problems get solved.
That's what l want.

2385
02:29:10,719 --> 02:29:14,587
You sign the agreement enhancing their
salaries. l'll go away.

2386
02:29:15,357 --> 02:29:21,853
It's time for marriage. Is it possible to
arrange for a meeting now?

2387
02:29:23,265 --> 02:29:25,631
lt'll work out. You talk to them
on phone, they'll come.

2388
02:29:25,834 --> 02:29:27,131
We are here for that purpose
only, aren't we?

2389
02:29:36,579 --> 02:29:38,672
Hi. - Hi.

2390
02:29:39,582 --> 02:29:41,516
Thank you.- You look very beautiful
in this dress.

2391
02:29:41,717 --> 02:29:42,376
How's this T-Shirt?

2392
02:29:42,585 --> 02:29:45,986
Mr. Sivam wears only full sleeves
he doesn't wear half sleeves.

2393
02:29:46,188 --> 02:29:46,950
Mr. Sivam?

2394
02:29:47,222 --> 02:29:49,281
Yes...my new elder brother.

2395
02:29:49,592 --> 02:29:52,755
Elder brother?- l'll tell you about it later.
l just want you to look for.

2396
02:29:53,295 --> 02:29:54,455
How's this?
How's this?

2397
02:29:56,565 --> 02:29:59,033
Hereafter you're a big hero
among workers.

2398
02:29:59,234 --> 02:29:59,893
Long live.

2399
02:30:01,170 --> 02:30:03,331
Enter politics!
You'll be very successful.

2400
02:30:03,706 --> 02:30:09,338
l don't have such an ambition.
l'm just a tool, that's all.

2401
02:30:10,112 --> 02:30:13,309
After hitting a nail, a hammer
should be put to rest.

2402
02:30:13,682 --> 02:30:15,877
After cutting the crops,
a sickle also needs to be put to rest.

2403
02:30:17,086 --> 02:30:20,681
l'll watch you sign the papers from
a corner and walk out silently.

2404
02:30:20,889 --> 02:30:22,220
Let it appear as if you came
down yourself.

2405
02:30:22,424 --> 02:30:24,858
Give this letter to Anbarasu.
- Why?

2406
02:30:25,060 --> 02:30:27,290
Don't get scared. You can read and
then give it to him.

2407
02:30:28,964 --> 02:30:30,659
Boss, Union leaders have arrived.

2408
02:30:30,866 --> 02:30:32,424
You read it and then hand it
over to him.

2409
02:30:32,835 --> 02:30:35,599
Greetings sir. - Greetings.

2410
02:30:36,138 --> 02:30:38,333
Is it ready?
- It's in my hand.

2411
02:30:39,508 --> 02:30:40,099
Where's he?

2412
02:30:40,309 --> 02:30:42,777
It's in the bag.
- Take it out and keep it ready.

2413
02:30:44,146 --> 02:30:46,671
Don't run on to the streets.
You might get hit by a bus. Be careful.

2414
02:31:08,570 --> 02:31:11,835
Thank you very much sir.
All workers will hail you wholeheartedly.

2415
02:31:12,041 --> 02:31:16,501
No need of all those big words.
Hail mercy of Lord Siva...

2416
02:31:20,849 --> 02:31:23,409
Siva orders me, l just follow it.
That's all.

2417
02:31:23,619 --> 02:31:26,144
Then, we'll take leave. - Okay.
- Then, we'll take leave.

2418
02:31:26,355 --> 02:31:28,050
We can paste this agreement
on the board.

2419
02:31:28,257 --> 02:31:29,918
And give it to newspapers, isn't it?

2420
02:31:31,527 --> 02:31:32,221
One minute.

2421
02:31:32,528 --> 02:31:33,927
How can you leave without partaking
the marriage feast!

2422
02:31:34,129 --> 02:31:36,222
Is everything ready?
- Everything is ready.

2423
02:31:36,432 --> 02:31:37,558
Have food and go.

2424
02:31:38,534 --> 02:31:41,162
We can send in a press note today itself.
- You did a good job.

2425
02:31:43,439 --> 02:31:49,605
Boss...boss...
What's this, boss?

2426
02:31:50,179 --> 02:31:51,441
Go and get my rifle.

2427
02:31:51,747 --> 02:31:52,543
He made me kneel down
before the workers.

2428
02:31:52,748 --> 02:31:54,648
l mustn't leave him alive.
- No boss, don't harm him.

2429
02:31:54,850 --> 02:31:57,318
Your daughter's marriage is in progress,
you don't do anything.

2430
02:31:57,519 --> 02:32:00,181
Why am l here?
Order me, l'll do it.

2431
02:32:01,490 --> 02:32:06,018
Okay, don't do anything here.
Make it a clean effort. - Okay.

2432
02:32:08,630 --> 02:32:11,827
His death should look ugly.

2433
02:32:16,171 --> 02:32:17,195
Whose letter is this?

2434
02:32:18,307 --> 02:32:20,366
Didn't l tell you about my
brother Sivam?

2435
02:32:20,943 --> 02:32:23,104
What language is this? l'm not able
to understand a word of it.

2436
02:32:24,480 --> 02:32:25,208
It's Tamil.

2437
02:32:26,582 --> 02:32:27,514
Scribbled.

2438
02:32:27,783 --> 02:32:31,241
His right hand is paralyzed.
He wrote with his left hand.

2439
02:32:32,121 --> 02:32:33,645
You're able to decipher it?
Why don't you read it for me?

2440
02:32:34,990 --> 02:32:38,687
My dear Comrade God, Anbarasu.

2441
02:32:38,894 --> 02:32:42,489
Though our principles are
totally different.

2442
02:32:42,698 --> 02:32:49,763
For giving me a relationship and
a permanent place to stay...

2443
02:32:49,972 --> 02:32:50,666
Give it to me.

2444
02:32:52,141 --> 02:32:56,237
Birds and Mendicants don't have a
permanent sanctuary.

2445
02:32:56,445 --> 02:32:57,969
l'm also a bird.

2446
02:32:58,213 --> 02:33:01,671
A bird that finds permanent
sanctuary uncomfortable.

2447
02:33:01,884 --> 02:33:05,718
Even so, the affection you've for me
shouldn't go waste.

2448
02:33:05,921 --> 02:33:09,584
Share it fully with your wife.

2449
02:33:11,293 --> 02:33:18,631
I doubt I'll ever come again under the
shadow of my brother's love in my life.

2450
02:33:18,834 --> 02:33:23,464
But, there're many surprises
stored for the next minute.

2451
02:33:23,672 --> 02:33:26,368
Meeting you is also one
such surprise.

2452
02:33:26,708 --> 02:33:30,439
I'm embarking on a journey with a hope
on this surprise springing world.

2453
02:33:30,779 --> 02:33:36,684
There're many pleasant surprises in store
for your future wife.

2454
02:33:36,952 --> 02:33:39,580
You'll be the reason for all that.

2455
02:33:39,788 --> 02:33:40,846
You must be.

2456
02:33:41,056 --> 02:33:43,854
Your loving brother, N. Sivam.

2457
02:33:44,526 --> 02:33:51,364
Where're you going?
Come here. Come here.

2458
02:33:51,567 --> 02:33:52,795
Entered the dust bin.

2459
02:33:53,202 --> 02:33:53,964
You ass.

2460
02:33:54,303 --> 02:33:55,361
Sorry, you dog.

2461
02:33:56,672 --> 02:33:59,300
Listen to me. Spit it out.

2462
02:33:59,508 --> 02:34:00,941
I'll buy you good food.

2463
02:34:01,143 --> 02:34:04,078
Listen to me. Good food.

2464
02:34:07,216 --> 02:34:08,911
Is it a cat?

2465
02:34:22,731 --> 02:34:24,096
Don't harm the dog.

2466
02:34:25,500 --> 02:34:28,196
Sangu, go away.

2467
02:34:31,006 --> 02:34:33,270
If I had been like before,
I would've fought with you.

2468
02:34:33,475 --> 02:34:35,705
Now, I'm an invalid.

2469
02:34:36,278 --> 02:34:37,745
I read your letter.

2470
02:34:38,180 --> 02:34:41,172
I committed many sins at
the behest of Kandaswamy.

2471
02:34:41,817 --> 02:34:44,547
For that God has punished me.

2472
02:34:46,622 --> 02:34:49,090
Do you remember, we had come to
meet you in Hospital?

2473
02:34:50,826 --> 02:34:59,734
After that within 6 months my daughter
fell sick and died in a hospital.

2474
02:35:00,569 --> 02:35:01,627
My only daughter.

2475
02:35:02,070 --> 02:35:03,901
She should've been married by now.

2476
02:35:05,407 --> 02:35:10,344
You saw my boss, didn't you?
But, God never punished my boss.

2477
02:35:11,613 --> 02:35:12,671
Like a hunter's dog.

2478
02:35:13,582 --> 02:35:17,040
God has punished me for the sins
I committed at my boss's behest.

2479
02:35:19,588 --> 02:35:22,955
If I commit sins further harming
good people like you...

2480
02:35:24,393 --> 02:35:26,327
God will punish me with
a gory death.

2481
02:35:28,697 --> 02:35:31,598
I believe in God.
I don't know about you.

2482
02:35:32,401 --> 02:35:36,132
I too believe.
-Is it? Which God?

2483
02:35:39,308 --> 02:35:40,104
Me?

2484
02:35:42,678 --> 02:35:48,310
A man who comes to kill another man,
changes his heart and asks forgiveness.

2485
02:35:50,185 --> 02:35:51,709
According to me, he's a God.

2486
02:35:51,920 --> 02:35:54,388
I've changed my heart.
I'm not any God.

2487
02:35:54,690 --> 02:35:59,093
Don't talk like an atheist.
There're many Gods roaming around.

2488
02:35:59,294 --> 02:36:00,921
We are not able to identify them.
Believe me.

2489
02:36:02,698 --> 02:36:03,562
Thanks.

2490
02:36:04,066 --> 02:36:06,864
I'll take leave.
-Don't come.

2491
02:36:09,871 --> 02:36:11,361
Don't come and spoil my life.

2492
02:36:13,675 --> 02:36:15,302
I'll tell my boss I've killed you.

2493
02:36:16,311 --> 02:36:16,868
What do you say?

2494
02:36:20,282 --> 02:36:24,218
I won't not spoil your life.
Live happily.

2495
02:36:30,492 --> 02:36:40,959
Let's all together say it in one voice.
...Love is God.

2496
02:36:41,169 --> 02:36:44,297
I can't believe he did this to me.
But he's right.

2497
02:36:45,607 --> 02:36:47,040
Sivam is like a bird.

2498
02:36:48,210 --> 02:36:51,304
It was my mistake to think of
caging him up.

2499
02:36:51,913 --> 02:36:56,373
Son-in-law, you can talk leisurely.
It's getting late, please come.

2500
02:36:56,885 --> 02:36:57,544
Boss! I've finished him.

2501
02:37:04,659 --> 02:37:07,127
Hail Lord Siva's mercy.

2502
02:37:09,064 --> 02:37:14,331
Who's God?

2503
02:37:15,337 --> 02:37:21,276
You and me are Gods.

2504
02:37:21,777 --> 02:37:28,046
A man drinking nectar of Love,
lives eternally.

2505
02:37:28,250 --> 02:37:34,416
Life's span is as long as
your heart's magnanimity.

2506
02:37:34,623 --> 02:37:56,900
Love is God.
