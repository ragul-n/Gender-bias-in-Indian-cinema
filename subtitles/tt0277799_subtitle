1
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,964
This is a simple story...

2
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,384
but not an easy one to tell.

3
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,137
Like a fable, there is sorrow...

4
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:58,641
and, like a fable,
it is full of wonder and happiness.

5
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:07,650
I sing what I see. Nothing gets by me.

6
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,236
" Here I am," said I to chaos.

7
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,365
"I am your slave!"
And he: "Good."

8
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,284
" For what?" said I.

9
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:21,414
Free in the end, I am!
What good is a caress when bliss...

10
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,250
this man came to possess?

11
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,711
Here I am, readry.

12
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,511
And I can resist no more.
Go, sweet Bacchus, take me.

13
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:38,556
The brakes are gone!
The brakes are gone!

14
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,725
I heard you.

15
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,395
- No, they're really gone!
- Hit the brakes!

16
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,980
Weren't you reciting a poem?

17
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:51,194
It doesn't work!

18
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,785
Brake!

19
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:02,789
We're going to die!
The woods!

20
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,340
Brake!

21
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,598
The king is coming!

22
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,560
There he is!

23
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,398
It's full of people down there.
Straight.

24
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,692
We have no brakes!

25
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,903
We have no brakes! Move!

26
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,525
Go for a walk.

27
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,528
Otherwise,
we'll get there tomorrow.

28
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,239
I found the screw.

29
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,868
Now what do you need?

30
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,497
Nothing.
I need ten minutes alone.

31
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,125
All right,
I'll leave you alone.

32
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,212
Do you want the screw
from before?

33
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,131
No, I want to be alone.

34
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,065
Do I toss out the screw
If I find it?

35
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,777
I need ten minutes alone.

36
00:03:56,528 --> 00:04:00,031
I'm washing my hands.

37
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,628
Prettry girl! How's it going?

38
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,214
What are you doing?

39
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,259
Did your mom put this stuff here?

40
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,845
No, the landladry did.

41
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,265
Is it a market? It's beautiful.

42
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,143
How much is it?
How old are you?

43
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,605
- What's your name?
- Eleonora.

44
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,525
Nice to meet you.
I'm Prince Guido.

45
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:40,363
- Prince?
- I'm a prince, I am.

46
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,283
All this is mine.

47
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,161
Here starts the prince's principate.

48
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,247
I'll call this place Addis Ababa.

49
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:54,794
I'll change it all.
Out go the cows, in come the camels.

50
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,089
Camels?

51
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,925
Even a few hippopotamus.

52
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,762
I must go.
I'm meeting with the princess.

53
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:07,057
- When?
- Now!

54
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,648
Good morning, Princess!

55
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:19,819
How frightening.
I almost killed myself. Did I hurt you?

56
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,364
I've never been better.

57
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,616
Do you always leave
the house like this?

58
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,994
I wanted to burn that wasp's nest,
but I got stung.

59
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,289
A wasp stung you? There?
Allow me.

60
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,333
Hold still, Princess.

61
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,420
A wasp's poison is very dangerous.

62
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,048
You have to get it out.

63
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:44,094
- Lie down. It'll take a while.
- No, thank you.

64
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,934
- Did you get stung anywhere else?
- No, thank you.

65
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:54,312
What a place here!
It's beautiful!

66
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:58,108
Pigeons fly, women fall from the sky.
I'm moving here!

67
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:02,946
It's all his! He wants to fill it
with camels! He's a prince!

68
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,865
Exactly.

69
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,744
Prince Guido
At your service, Princess.

70
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,414
I'm coming!

71
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,083
Good-bye, then.

72
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,295
- How can I thank you?
- There's no need.

73
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,340
If you really want
to thank me...

74
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:26,469
I'll take some eggs to make
a nice omelette for my squire.

75
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,431
Take whatever you want.
It's all yours.

76
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,349
Thank you!

77
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:35,979
I'll take two-- six.
All right? I'll make a nice omelette.

78
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,275
Good-bye, Eleonora!
My regards, Princess.

79
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,613
Farewell.

80
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:50,493
Here I am, Ferruccio!
Tonight's special: omelette!

81
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,621
All camels here!

82
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:08,887
- Where is this house?
- Turn left. We're almost there.

83
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,057
Is your uncle sleeping with us?

84
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,019
He's lived in the hotel for 30 years.
He's the head maitre.

85
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,939
He's lending us the house.
He uses it for storage.

86
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,025
There. We're here.

87
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,112
That's Robin Hood,
my uncle's horse.

88
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,907
Here's my uncle's buggy
and my uncle's house.

89
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,493
And inside is my uncle.

90
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,122
Hello, dear uncle! Here we are!
Hurry, it's late.

91
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,792
Here we are.
The car broke down!

92
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,510
Uncle!

93
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,686
- Barbarians.
- Who were they?

94
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,605
- Barbarians.
- Why didn't you cry for help?

95
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:04,025
Silence is
the most powerful cry.

96
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,695
Is he your poet friend?

97
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,739
My name is Ferruccio.
I'm also an upholsterer.

98
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:15,662
Here you are. It's an old storehouse
full of odds and ends.

99
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:20,166
An old passion--
an odd and end in itself!.

100
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,503
What's all this stuff for?

101
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:28,550
You can stay as long as you want.
It's not easy to be a waiter.

102
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,971
That's the bed.
Legend has it Garibaldi slept there.

103
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,890
Nothing is more necessary
than the unnecessary.

104
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,851
Barbarians.

105
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:42,022
The town hall is on Via Sestani,
to the right after the colonnade.

106
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:46,735
The bathroom, equipped
with the invention of Mr. Bidet.

107
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:51,656
There are a few books here,
among which The Life of Petrarch.

108
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:57,787
The kitchen is in there. This is
a velocipede, commonly called a bike.

109
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:03,418
I have to get back to the hotel.
There's only one key. Don't lose it.

110
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:09,758
It's so good to see you.
I'm coming, Robin Hood!

111
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,681
What an uncle!

112
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,269
Look at this!

113
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:27,901
Didn't I tell you? We're in a citry.
You can do whatever you want.

114
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,821
If you want to do something,
you do it.

115
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,200
You want to let yourself go?
You want to yell? Yell!

116
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,122
Stop it!
What are you, crazy?

117
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,709
You can't act
like you do in the country.

118
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,214
You've been yelling like a madman.
You can't yell!

119
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,050
May! The key!

120
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,516
See? You can't yell.

121
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:03,978
Understand? If you stopped thinking
so much about poetry...

122
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:08,942
you'd make your father happier
and you'd make more money than him.

123
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,112
That's right, Oreste.
That's what I tell him too.

124
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,031
You have to settle down!

125
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,493
What a nice hat.
How does it look?

126
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,913
- Nice. How does it look?
- Nice, but it's mine.

127
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,791
When do I start working?

128
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,794
You're already late.
Right away!

129
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:31,214
Get that armchair
and take it to the workshop.

130
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:36,302
- That one?
- That one. And be careful!

131
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:40,348
Good. I'm going to the town hall.
Good-bye.

132
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:44,019
Good-bye,
and behave yourselves...

133
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,397
because these are hard times.

134
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,816
Hard, hard times!

135
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,318
They're hard times?

136
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:56,031
Why, what are your
political views?

137
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:00,160
Benito! Adolph!
Be good!

138
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,996
What did you say?

139
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:08,209
I said, how are things going?

140
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,004
Good-bye, then.

141
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,298
Careful!
You'll break the legs!

142
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:16,968
Good-bye!

143
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:29,439
He pulled it off.
He took my hat. I'll find him though.

144
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,901
Benito,
you're going to get a slap!

145
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:40,033
I need to do the whole bureaucratic
procedure to open a bookstore.

146
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,495
- Does it take a long time?
- Years.

147
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,081
Then we'd better
open a file now.

148
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:50,377
First you apply, and
the department head has to sign it.

149
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:58,677
I almost scrambled my eggs.
I've had them since yesterday.

150
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,722
I forgot about them.
Thank God they didn't break. Take note.

151
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,350
I, the undersigned,
Guido Orefice...

152
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,895
- am applying to open--
- He can't sign it now!

153
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,149
What's going on?

154
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:16,361
I need your signature
to open a bookstore.

155
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:20,198
- Miss, what's going on?
- Mr. Rodolfo, I told him.

156
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,535
-Just one signature.
- No, I can't.

157
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,830
My substitute will be here
in an hour. Ask him.

158
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:31,376
- All I need is a signature.
- We close at one here!

159
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,421
It's ten to one.

160
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,464
File a complaint.

161
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:41,553
Boy, is he nastry.

162
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:46,016
To sign a paper, open a file,
all he had to do was--

163
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,103
Now I have to wait one hour
for his substitute.

164
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,481
I'm filing a complaint.
Write, "I, the undersigned--"

165
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,321
What a wallop!

166
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,787
Are you hurt?
I'll help you.

167
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,248
Come here.
I didn't do it on purpose.

168
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,375
Don't touch me!

169
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:17,505
You can forget
about your bookshop!

170
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,759
No, the eggs!

171
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:27,098
You scoundrel!
I'll kill you!

172
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,820
Out of the way!

173
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,374
Good morning, Princess.

174
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:57,671
I wonder if we'll ever bump
into each other standing up.

175
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:01,299
Excuse me,
but I've got to run.

176
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,719
Farewell, Princess!

177
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:24,781
- Chicken.
- That's easy.

178
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:28,368
It's served whole,
bottom down on the plate.

179
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,037
"Will you cut it for me?"
" Naturally."

180
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:35,291
I stick the blade under the wing
then I rip off the drumstick.

181
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:39,045
I cut the meat along
the bottom of the breastbone.

182
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,549
- Off go the wings, breast and skin.
- Lobster.

183
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,802
Piece of cake, Uncle.

184
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:49,639
I stick the wing under the leg.

185
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,018
Off goes the leg.
I rip off the lobster, stick the--

186
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,937
Lobster is a crustacean.

187
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:02,610
Off goes the crust...
of the crustacean.

188
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:08,908
Off go the crust and antennae.
Who eats the antennae?

189
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:13,038
Off go the antennae,
off goes the lobster.

190
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,373
There's nothing left.

191
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,793
We're out of lobster,
but the chicken is delicious.

192
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:25,467
- I don't remember how to do lobster.
- You serve it as is.

193
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,595
There's no need to touch it!

194
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,598
That's too easy.
That's why I didn't remember.

195
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,059
- Continue.
- Behavior!

196
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,770
Stand by.
Still, like this.

197
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,272
"Waiter?"
"Yes?"

198
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,400
In position.
Stand by behavior. Waiter!

199
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,997
Why only me?
There must be other waiters, right?

200
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,544
Bowing!
Piece of cake.

201
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,592
You bow down, further.

202
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:12,472
Like this, at a 45 degree angle,
just like a champagne bottle.

203
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,559
45 degrees, even 50, 55.

204
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:20,397
90 degrees.
A right angle. 1 80.

205
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:24,693
How far do I bow down?
1 80 degrees? Like this?

206
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,613
Think of a sunflower.
They bow to the sun.

207
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:32,075
But if you see some
that are too bowed down...

208
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:34,369
it means they're dead!

209
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,372
You're serving.
You're not a servant.

210
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,291
Serving is a supreme art.

211
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,420
God is the first servant.

212
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:47,382
God serves men,
but he's not a servant to men.

213
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:52,512
- There was no button here.
- It doesn't go there, silly.

214
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:56,933
I have to take the car back to Pop.
He's counting on it.

215
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,769
You'll take it back
in a month or so.

216
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,356
No, I've got to get it back soon.
You know why?

217
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,193
Why?

218
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:19,414
- What? What time is it?
- Were you sleeping?

219
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,667
Of course I was.

220
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:26,254
You fell asleep
while talking to me!

221
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:29,466
- How did you do that?
- Schopenhauer.

222
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,926
Who?

223
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:36,181
Schopenhauer says that with willpower,
you can do anything.

224
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,017
"I am what I want to be."

225
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,854
Right now I want to sleep,
so I was saying to myself...

226
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,982
"I'm sleeping, sleeping,"
and I fell asleep.

227
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:50,320
Amazing.
And it's simple too.

228
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,199
I want to try too.
I'm sleeping, sleeping, sleeping--

229
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,872
Don't move your hands.
You're not a juggler.

230
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:05,126
It's a matter of thought.
It's serious, and it takes time.

231
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:07,962
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

232
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,591
Amazing, though.

233
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:15,929
Wake up.

234
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,140
Wake up.

235
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,270
What is it now?
What are you doing?

236
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:27,148
- It totally works!
- What works?

237
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:31,945
Schopenhauer.
You know what I just said? "Wake up."

238
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:36,408
Bam, you woke up.
This theory is incredible.

239
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,744
- How does it work?
- You were yelling in my ear!

240
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:43,373
That's why I woke up.

241
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:47,585
- So I should say it quieter.
- Don't say it at all!

242
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,093
It's deep.
You have to think it.

243
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,226
Why are you running?
Slow down!

244
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,311
Hurry up. It's late!

245
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:07,856
May, the key!

246
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,111
Every morning,
she throws the key.

247
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,071
Look!

248
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,450
There's that teacher.
Boy, is she pretty.

249
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:22,579
I even dreamt about her.
Come with me. I'll introduce you.

250
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:26,583
- Holy smokes! Stay still!
- What is it?

251
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:28,793
Don't move!

252
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:33,465
The one in the car.
He's that jerk the eggs fell on.

253
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,926
He'll kill me if he sees me.
Be good.

254
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,721
- What's he doing?
- He's talking.

255
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,474
- What's he saying?
- How do I know?

256
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:46,728
- What's he doing?
- He's saying good-bye.

257
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:51,232
He's got a car just like mine!
There he is!

258
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:55,028
Don't move.
He'll kill me if he sees me!

259
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:57,280
Stay still, Ferruccio.

260
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,829
Good morning, Princess!

261
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:10,835
It's you again.
How do you do this?

262
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:15,382
This is the princess
who fell from the sky into my arms.

263
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:19,719
Is he the one who sucked
the stinger out of your thigh?

264
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,765
Yes. We keep meeting like this.
You just suddenly show up.

265
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:28,019
We could make plans to meet.

266
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,398
- Tonight at 8:00?
- No, it's nicer this way.

267
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,775
Let's go, Dora.
You'll be late.

268
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,698
I hope we meet again
suddenly.

269
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:43,702
Farewell, Princess!

270
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,705
Did you see her?
She's pretty, huh?

271
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,708
She likes it
when I suddenly appear.

272
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:02,929
I don't believe it.

273
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:06,057
"Obscurity."

274
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:08,435
You're a genius!

275
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:11,980
"The bigger it is,
the less you see it."

276
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,524
Solution: obscurity.

277
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,819
Marvelous.
Did you make that riddle up?

278
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:23,283
No, but you solved it in five minutes.
It took me eight days.

279
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:26,161
Obscurity!

280
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:29,497
Salmon, salad
and a glass of white wine.

281
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,500
Listen to this one, Guido.

282
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:37,464
If I may, it's my turn.

283
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,425
My pop told me this
when I was a wee boy.

284
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,678
"The dwarves and Snow White
sit down for a bite.

285
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:48,975
How fast can you guess
what she serves her guests next?"

286
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,566
It sounds refined.

287
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,361
I want to solve it right now.

288
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:03,406
- Eat first or it'll get cold.
- I don't want to. It's too late.

289
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,534
Salad, salmon, white wine.
It's light.

290
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:09,079
The dwarves...

291
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:12,957
and Snow White.

292
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:20,799
- Is the kitchen closed?
- Everybody's gone. Why?

293
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:24,844
A gentleman from Rome is here
from the Ministry. He wants to eat.

294
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:27,305
The kitchen is closed.

295
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:30,308
Oh, well, he would have
given you a good tip.

296
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,936
The kitchen is open.

297
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,897
Come right in.

298
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:50,078
Doctor, you're not eating anything?

299
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,625
"The dwarves and Snow White--"

300
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:02,298
I know the kitchen is closed.
Maybe a cold dish.

301
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:08,013
- It's all delicious. Take your pick.
- Something light.

302
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:12,142
Well, we've got meat,
a nice heavy steak...

303
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:16,396
lamb, kidneys,
some greasy breaded liver.

304
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,774
- Otherwise, there's fish.
- Fish.

305
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,903
We have...
a nice fatty turbot...

306
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:28,116
eel stuffed with fatty sausage
and greased with Grand Marnier...

307
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,702
or some lean salmon--

308
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:33,663
The salmon, thank you.

309
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,958
- Side dish?
- There's a side dish too?

310
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:42,088
Of course.
We have very, very fried mushrooms...

311
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:46,634
buttered potatoes in Nancry butter
with a flaky sauce--

312
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:52,557
Is there a small, light salad?
If not, nothing.

313
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:58,688
A light salad? What a pity.
The very, very fried mushrooms...

314
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:02,567
were out of this world.
So, a light salad...

315
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:05,779
a lean salmon
and a glass of white wine.

316
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,823
Perfect.
As soon as possible.

317
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:11,409
I'll do my best.

318
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,849
" How fast can you guess
what she serves her guests next?"

319
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:36,851
Right.

320
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:41,731
- "The dwarves and Snow White."
- Good night, Doctor.

321
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:44,651
Good night, genius.

322
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,616
What did he say? The dwarves?
What is he, drunk?

323
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:54,327
It's a riddle.
"Seven seconds."

324
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:01,334
"Seven seconds" is the solution.
"The dwarves and Snow White."

325
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:04,462
If there are seven dwarves dining...

326
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:07,507
and she serves seconds,
that means "seven seconds."

327
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:13,388
Doctor Lessing is a physician,
a very serious person.

328
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:17,600
But he's obsessed with riddles.
He loses sleep over them.

329
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:24,733
Excuse me.
The " Francesco Petrarca" school.

330
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:30,822
The elementary school? A friend
Of mine teaches there. It's beautiful.

331
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:34,034
It's not far from here. Why?

332
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:37,203
Good. I can sleep
an extra half hour.

333
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:41,416
Do you have to go
to that school tomorrow morning?

334
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,044
They're expecting me at 8:30.

335
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:56,014
Please, children, silence!
A moment of attention.

336
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:59,934
The inspector from Rome
will be here shortly.

337
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:02,937
I want to make
a good impression on him.

338
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,275
Listen very quietly
and carefully to what he says.

339
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:11,571
He'll tell us some very important
things about our beautiful country.

340
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:16,451
The inspector is here, ma'am.

341
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:19,829
He's already here?
He's early!

342
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:22,248
Sit down, Roberto!

343
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:30,840
All rise!

344
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:38,640
Good morning, Princess.

345
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:46,523
Good morning, Mr. Inspector.
I'm the principal.

346
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,776
These are some of our teachers.

347
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:54,948
Good.

348
00:26:58,076 --> 00:26:59,536
Therefore--

349
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:06,084
How many years have you taught
in this school district?

350
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:08,378
Sixteen.

351
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:14,426
Are you up to date
with the ongoing...

352
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:17,429
school program approved
by the Ministry this year?

353
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:19,431
Yes.

354
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:26,563
Did you read the bulletin
regarding childhood hygiene?

355
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:29,566
Of course.

356
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:35,155
What are you doing on Sunday?

357
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:40,744
No, I mean, Sunday is St. May's Day.
What are you doing?

358
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:44,372
I'm going to the theater.

359
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:49,794
- To see what?
- Offenbach.

360
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:52,589
Right,
they're playing Offenbach.

361
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,471
Fine. Well--

362
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:04,142
Thank you very much, and good-bye.
I just came to--

363
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:06,394
We know.

364
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:09,230
As you know, the inspector...

365
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:12,734
came from Rome to talk to us
about the race manifesto...

366
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:16,988
signed by the most well versed
Italian scientists.

367
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:21,159
He will, and we're very honored...

368
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,496
demonstrate to us that our race...

369
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:27,123
is a superior race--

370
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:29,918
the best of all.

371
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,379
Take your seats.

372
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:37,801
Go ahead, Inspector.

373
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:41,262
- Our race--
- Is superior.

374
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:43,431
Naturally!

375
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:47,435
Our race is superior.

376
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:51,731
I've just come from Rome,
right this minute...

377
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:56,069
to come and tell you in order
that you'll know, children...

378
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:58,863
that our race
is a superior one.

379
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:01,324
I was...

380
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:06,204
chosen, I was,
by racist Italian scientists...

381
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:09,165
in order to demonstrate...

382
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:12,460
how superior our race is.

383
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:17,048
Why did they pick me, children?

384
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:22,554
Must I tell you?

385
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:28,435
Where can you find...

386
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:32,230
someone more handsome than me?

387
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:37,068
Justly so, there is silence.
I'm an original "superior race"...

388
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:39,487
pure Aryan.

389
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:41,698
Children.

390
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,368
Let's start with something that
one says: "What's so big about that?"

391
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:50,749
The ear. Look at
the perfection of this ear.

392
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:54,461
Left auricle...

393
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:57,797
with a pendant
little bell at the end.

394
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:01,468
Check it out.
Movable cartilage.

395
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:03,845
Bendable.

396
00:30:04,346 --> 00:30:07,349
Find two ears more beautiful
than these and I'll leave!

397
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:12,062
But you have to show me them.
They dream about these in France!

398
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:16,107
Races exist, children.
You bet they do!

399
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:20,153
But let's continue.
I want to show you something else.

400
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:22,697
Pay attention.

401
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:26,826
He said Inspector?

402
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:29,412
From Rome?

403
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:33,583
The belly button!

404
00:30:36,878 --> 00:30:40,215
Take a look at this belly button!
What a knot!

405
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:43,343
But you can't untie it,
not even with your teeth!

406
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,971
Those racist scientists tried it.
Not a chance!

407
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:50,850
This is an Italian belly button.
It's part of our race!

408
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:53,728
Check out this style!

409
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:59,275
Look at these muscles:
ceps, biceps, triceps!

410
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:03,488
Look at this beauty!
Admire this hip!

411
00:31:09,703 --> 00:31:12,664
Just look at the movement!

412
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:14,624
Gentlemen!

413
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:20,005
I must say good-bye now.

414
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:23,675
I have to go.
I have an appointment.

415
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:27,220
I'll make my Aryan exit
and bid you farewell.

416
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:29,848
Farewell!
The belly button!

417
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:36,354
I'll see you in Venice, Princess.

418
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:57,852
I can only hear
out of this ear.

419
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:24,796
Look at me, Princess.

420
00:33:25,588 --> 00:33:27,590
Go on, I'm down here.

421
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:33,221
Look at me, Princess.

422
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:56,619
Turn around, Princess.

423
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:01,416
Turn around, around--

424
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,883
- Can we get a chocolate ice cream?
- Yes, but we'll have to be quick.

425
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:53,968
Why?

426
00:34:54,302 --> 00:34:58,723
We have to be at the Prefect's at eight.
We were invited to dinner.

427
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:01,559
- Where?
- At the Prefect's.

428
00:35:03,436 --> 00:35:06,314
Have pity on me, Lord.
Let it not be true.

429
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:10,235
- Another dinner at the Prefect's?
- Your mother is coming too.

430
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:12,487
Bingo!

431
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:17,742
Let's us just go to dinner.
We'll stop by the Prefect's for coffee.

432
00:35:18,827 --> 00:35:20,954
I'm not coming!

433
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:24,207
All right, I heard you!
I'll tell him we're not going.

434
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:27,210
It'll just be me and you.

435
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:32,590
- Good evening, Rodolfo!
- Good evening, Mr. Prefect.

436
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:37,512
I'll see you later at my house.
I'll expect you at 8:00.

437
00:35:38,221 --> 00:35:40,181
We'll be there at 8:00 sharp.

438
00:35:46,062 --> 00:35:48,481
Where is she?
Did you see her?

439
00:35:49,065 --> 00:35:51,568
- She has to be here.
- You're here?

440
00:35:54,112 --> 00:35:56,781
On time tomorrow, got it?

441
00:35:57,407 --> 00:35:59,909
Did you take that stuff
out of the car?

442
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:03,329
It's silk. Don't ruin it.
Be very careful.

443
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:08,626
- What an opera.
- Beautiful!

444
00:36:12,297 --> 00:36:15,258
Is that one of your curtains?

445
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:19,179
No, it must be
one of my colleague's.

446
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:25,143
He took my hat again!

447
00:36:26,811 --> 00:36:29,230
- Let's go.
- Don't you see how it's raining?

448
00:36:29,814 --> 00:36:32,609
- You go get the car.
- It's right around the corner.

449
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:35,779
All right, you wait here.

450
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:39,908
I'll pull up right here
and toot.

451
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:44,287
Give me the key!

452
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:47,123
Not the house key!
The car key!

453
00:36:49,584 --> 00:36:51,836
The car key?
Are you crazy?

454
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:55,131
Keep him busy, you know,
the jerk the eggs fell on.

455
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:58,385
Keep him busy as long as you can.
I'll see you tonight.

456
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,346
Inside the car there's--
Go slow!

457
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:25,829
The least you could have done
is come get me with the umbrella.

458
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:29,457
You're just plain rude.
Look what a mess I am.

459
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:34,379
Plus, dinner at the Prefect's
gets me so nervous!

460
00:37:37,132 --> 00:37:39,634
I knew it.
I've got the hiccups.

461
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:44,597
I always get them when I'm made
to do something I don't want to.

462
00:37:45,515 --> 00:37:48,768
Don't you know that it takes
so little to make me happy?

463
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:52,397
A chocolate ice cream is enough!
Even two!

464
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:56,693
A nice walk together
and then whatever happens happens.

465
00:37:57,569 --> 00:37:59,863
Instead you--

466
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,742
Good morning, Princess!

467
00:38:06,494 --> 00:38:09,456
This is incredible.
You owe me an explanation.

468
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:13,084
No, you're the one
who owes me an explanation!

469
00:38:13,835 --> 00:38:16,921
I stop under a roof and you fall
from the sky into my arms.

470
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,675
I fall off my bicrycle
and end up in your arms.

471
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:25,430
I do an inspection at school,
and there you are again!

472
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:28,767
You even turn up in my dreams.

473
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:34,356
Will you leave me alone?
You've really got a crush on me.

474
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:37,442
I don't blame you, but--

475
00:38:37,984 --> 00:38:41,613
All right. At this point,
I give in. You win.

476
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:45,700
Where shall we go, Princess?
To the sea! Do you like the sea?

477
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:49,746
Yes, but they're waiting for me
at the theater. Take me back.

478
00:38:51,831 --> 00:38:53,166
What's happening?

479
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:57,504
Princess, do you know how
to turn on the windshield wipers?

480
00:38:58,463 --> 00:39:00,465
Step on the brakes!

481
00:39:03,301 --> 00:39:05,970
Have no fear!
Hang on to me!

482
00:39:06,596 --> 00:39:08,598
It's broken!

483
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:11,226
When did you learn to drive?

484
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:14,312
- Ten minutes ago.
- I thought it was less than that.

485
00:39:14,896 --> 00:39:18,066
- The top doesn't close.
- The door won't open.

486
00:39:18,817 --> 00:39:21,736
Wait! We're stuck!

487
00:39:22,404 --> 00:39:25,115
We'll get out of here.
I'll take care of it.

488
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:28,034
The important thing is that
you don't get wet.

489
00:39:28,618 --> 00:39:30,829
Cover yourself with this.

490
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:33,540
Take it.
We'll get out of here now.

491
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:37,752
I'll take care of everything.

492
00:39:40,422 --> 00:39:42,382
Here we go.

493
00:39:44,092 --> 00:39:46,511
Step right out, Princess.

494
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:52,934
There!
Step right out!

495
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,274
There's a huge puddle!
You'll get your feet wet! Wait!

496
00:40:05,113 --> 00:40:06,614
Here!

497
00:40:14,164 --> 00:40:16,124
- Go ahead, Princess.
- Where are we?

498
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:19,669
We've already been here.

499
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:24,215
- Me and you? When?
- Don't you remember?

500
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,926
The night it was raining...

501
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:30,013
and I made you an umbrella
out of a pillow!

502
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:34,809
It was a beautiful night. I put
the steering wheel on my shoulder...

503
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:39,564
did a little waltz,
and when I stopped in front of you...

504
00:40:40,482 --> 00:40:41,775
you kissed me.

505
00:40:56,206 --> 00:40:58,541
Princess, your behind
is blowing in the wind.

506
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:08,051
It depends on the person.
My pop was like that.

507
00:41:08,927 --> 00:41:12,013
He had the ability
to make me do anything.

508
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:15,266
He understood me.
He knew how to deal with me.

509
00:41:15,892 --> 00:41:18,103
I was like putty in his hand.

510
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:21,481
I always, always, always said yes.

511
00:41:23,608 --> 00:41:26,611
So, all these treasures
you're hiding--

512
00:41:27,362 --> 00:41:32,325
there is a way to open this treasure
chest and always get you to say yes!

513
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:35,787
It's easier than you think.

514
00:41:36,371 --> 00:41:38,957
- All you need is the right key.
- And where exactly is it?

515
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:42,127
Heaven knows.

516
00:41:42,752 --> 00:41:44,629
It's clearing up.

517
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:47,716
So, you were saying...

518
00:41:48,341 --> 00:41:52,053
the key that always makes you say yes
has to come from heaven.

519
00:41:52,887 --> 00:41:54,097
Yes.

520
00:41:54,472 --> 00:41:56,808
I'll give it a try.

521
00:41:57,392 --> 00:42:02,188
If the Virgin May tosses
it down to me-- You never know.

522
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:05,400
May, the key!

523
00:42:09,487 --> 00:42:11,322
Is this it?

524
00:42:14,325 --> 00:42:17,579
Do you really have to go home?
What about the chocolate ice cream?

525
00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:20,373
- Let's get it right now.
- No, not now.

526
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:23,418
- Then when?
- I don't know.

527
00:42:24,044 --> 00:42:27,130
Are we going to let heaven
decide that too?

528
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:32,010
No, leave May alone.
Don't bother her over an ice cream!

529
00:42:32,927 --> 00:42:36,765
No, it's way too important.
We can't decide when to have it.

530
00:42:37,682 --> 00:42:40,435
I have to ask her.

531
00:42:41,102 --> 00:42:43,313
May, send someone to find out...

532
00:42:43,855 --> 00:42:46,775
how long before
we can have the ice cream!

533
00:42:49,152 --> 00:42:51,196
Seven seconds!

534
00:42:58,203 --> 00:43:01,331
- This is my house.
- I've gone by here a thousand times.

535
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,167
I've always asked myself:
Who lives there?

536
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:07,253
I wanted to open
my store right out front.

537
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:10,715
- The bookshop?
- Yes. I'll see you every day.

538
00:43:11,466 --> 00:43:13,134
Good-bye then.

539
00:43:13,593 --> 00:43:17,180
You've been so nice to me.
All I want now is a hot bath.

540
00:43:18,014 --> 00:43:20,433
I forgot to tell you.

541
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:24,145
Go ahead.

542
00:43:24,604 --> 00:43:27,565
You can't imagine how much
I feel like making love to you.

543
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:33,113
But I'll never tell anyone,
especially not you.

544
00:43:33,863 --> 00:43:35,990
They'd have to torture me
to make me say it.

545
00:43:36,491 --> 00:43:40,829
- Say what?
- That I want to make love to you.

546
00:43:41,746 --> 00:43:44,124
Not just once.
Over and over again!

547
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:46,459
But I'll never tell you that.

548
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,755
I'd have to be crazy to tell you
I'd even make love to you now...

549
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:53,591
right here,
for the rest of my life.

550
00:43:57,345 --> 00:43:59,848
You'd better run or you'll get wet.
It's going to rain again.

551
00:44:00,515 --> 00:44:02,475
Princess.

552
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:07,188
- You're all wet.
- My suit is no big deal.

553
00:44:07,897 --> 00:44:10,817
It's that hat that bothers me.

554
00:44:11,526 --> 00:44:15,113
I need a dry hat,
but where can I find one?

555
00:44:15,947 --> 00:44:19,659
How did it go?
Right, it's easy!

556
00:44:20,535 --> 00:44:24,706
May, send someone
to give my friend a dry hat.

557
00:44:36,051 --> 00:44:38,303
Good night, Princess.
Farewell.

558
00:45:03,787 --> 00:45:07,248
- Excuse me, where's the restroom?
- Straight ahead to the left.

559
00:45:17,967 --> 00:45:21,012
If you don't get up
immediately...

560
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,809
I swear on your father's deathbed
I'll never speak to you again.

561
00:45:26,726 --> 00:45:28,478
For the rest of my life!

562
00:45:30,647 --> 00:45:32,607
I'm going to count
to three now.

563
00:45:33,149 --> 00:45:35,652
If you don't get up,
I'll force you to get up.

564
00:45:53,586 --> 00:45:56,006
Good girl.

565
00:45:56,631 --> 00:45:59,009
Do you know
who's getting married?

566
00:45:59,592 --> 00:46:02,679
Didn't I tell you?
That jerk the eggs fell on!

567
00:46:07,642 --> 00:46:09,978
- Who's he marrying?
- I don't know.

568
00:46:10,603 --> 00:46:12,856
But she hasn't even
shown up yet.

569
00:46:13,356 --> 00:46:15,650
Everybody's waiting.

570
00:46:16,234 --> 00:46:18,486
I've looked everywhere for you!

571
00:46:19,029 --> 00:46:21,281
- Your uncle.
- My uncle?

572
00:46:21,906 --> 00:46:23,950
Something's happened.
Come with me!

573
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:26,494
Outside! The horse!

574
00:46:29,914 --> 00:46:32,417
What's that?

575
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:35,211
Is that your horse?

576
00:46:35,754 --> 00:46:38,506
What a sight!
What did they write on him?

577
00:46:39,215 --> 00:46:42,344
"Achtung, Jewish horse."

578
00:46:43,094 --> 00:46:47,557
The usual barbarians, vandals.
It's sad. What nonsense.

579
00:46:48,558 --> 00:46:50,018
"Jewish horse"!

580
00:46:50,393 --> 00:46:54,814
Don't get upset.
They just did it to--

581
00:46:55,857 --> 00:46:58,943
They didn't do it "to."
They did it "to."

582
00:47:00,945 --> 00:47:03,365
You'll have to get
used to it, Guido.

583
00:47:03,948 --> 00:47:06,826
- They'll start with you too.
- With me?

584
00:47:07,494 --> 00:47:09,913
What could possibly happen to me?

585
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:13,333
The worst they can do is undress me,
paint me yellow and write...

586
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,211
"Achtung, Jewish waiter."

587
00:47:18,254 --> 00:47:20,340
I didn't even know
this horse was Jewish.

588
00:47:20,924 --> 00:47:23,510
Let's go. I'll clean him up
in the morning.

589
00:47:24,052 --> 00:47:26,096
Take him back to the stall.

590
00:47:49,452 --> 00:47:52,038
Look, there, in front of you!

591
00:47:59,754 --> 00:48:01,798
Wait. I'll surprise her.

592
00:48:14,728 --> 00:48:18,106
Come with me. I'd like to
introduce you to Fido Giovanardi.

593
00:48:31,411 --> 00:48:34,914
Doctor Lessing!
Where are you going?

594
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:40,003
Urgent telegram.
I must go to Berlin immediately.

595
00:48:42,255 --> 00:48:45,258
- What are these flowers?
- They're for your departure.

596
00:48:48,595 --> 00:48:50,347
I'll take just one.

597
00:48:52,307 --> 00:48:54,517
I'll take it to my wife:
Guido's flower.

598
00:48:56,895 --> 00:48:59,773
I truly enjoyed myself with you.

599
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,484
You're the most ingenious...

600
00:49:02,942 --> 00:49:05,737
waiter I've ever come across.

601
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:09,741
Thank you. You're the customer with
the most culture I've ever served.

602
00:49:10,492 --> 00:49:12,243
Thank you.

603
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,662
Good-bye, Doctor Lessing.

604
00:49:15,246 --> 00:49:17,207
By the way.

605
00:49:20,001 --> 00:49:23,129
"If you say my name...

606
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:26,508
I'm not there anymore.
Who am I?"

607
00:49:29,386 --> 00:49:32,597
If you say my name,
I'm not there anymore.

608
00:49:37,602 --> 00:49:39,646
What is it?
What did he say?

609
00:49:43,775 --> 00:49:45,485
"Silence!"

610
00:49:45,944 --> 00:49:50,573
Beautiful. If you say the word,
it's not there anymore. Silence.

611
00:49:54,285 --> 00:49:58,248
I'm not talking about Berlin,
in the outskirts. Imagine that!

612
00:50:00,458 --> 00:50:03,503
Third grade.
Listen to this problem.

613
00:50:04,254 --> 00:50:07,257
I remember it
because it shocked me.

614
00:50:08,008 --> 00:50:11,302
A lunatic costs the state
four marks a day.

615
00:50:12,053 --> 00:50:14,431
A cripple,
four and a half marks.

616
00:50:15,056 --> 00:50:17,934
An epileptic,
three marks and a half.

617
00:50:18,601 --> 00:50:22,272
Considering that the average
is four marks a day...

618
00:50:23,106 --> 00:50:26,693
and there are 300,000 patients,
how much would the state save...

619
00:50:27,527 --> 00:50:30,405
if these individuals
were eliminated?

620
00:50:31,156 --> 00:50:33,658
I can't believe this!

621
00:50:34,242 --> 00:50:37,037
That was my exact reaction.

622
00:50:37,704 --> 00:50:40,957
I can't believe
a seven-year-old child...

623
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,752
has to solve
this kind of equation.

624
00:50:44,252 --> 00:50:48,631
It's a difficult calculation.
Proportions, percentages.

625
00:50:49,549 --> 00:50:51,968
They need at least some algebra
to do those equations.

626
00:50:52,552 --> 00:50:54,554
That's high school material for us.

627
00:50:55,096 --> 00:50:59,351
No, all it takes is multiplication.
You said there are 300,000 cripples?

628
00:51:01,436 --> 00:51:03,521
300,000 times four.

629
00:51:04,105 --> 00:51:07,525
If we killed them all,
we'd save 1 ,200,000 marks a day.

630
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:11,071
- It's easy!
- Exactly!

631
00:51:11,696 --> 00:51:16,326
But you're an adult. They make seven-
year-old children do this in Germany!

632
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:19,371
It's truly another race.

633
00:51:24,292 --> 00:51:25,502
"Good morning, Princess."

634
00:51:28,046 --> 00:51:31,257
- What did you say?
- It's here, on the cake.

635
00:51:56,449 --> 00:51:59,536
Why are you just standing there?
Let's go!

636
00:52:00,286 --> 00:52:02,330
Let's dance.

637
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:50,628
Just a few words.
You already know it all by now...

638
00:52:51,338 --> 00:52:53,590
and you've known
for several years.

639
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:57,385
Dora and I were born
on the same street.

640
00:52:58,178 --> 00:53:01,139
We went to school together,
we had the same friends.

641
00:53:04,934 --> 00:53:06,770
Dora is the woman of my life...

642
00:53:07,228 --> 00:53:10,815
and I'm the man in her life,
therefore...

643
00:53:11,649 --> 00:53:14,402
we've decided to get married
within the year.

644
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:18,073
You're all officially invited
on April the 9th...

645
00:53:18,782 --> 00:53:21,576
to the Basilica of
Santa Maria del Pellegrino.

646
00:53:22,243 --> 00:53:26,748
And then we'll celebrate till dawn
all together, right here...

647
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:30,085
just as happy as we are now.

648
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:34,798
Kiss her! Kiss her!

649
00:53:49,187 --> 00:53:51,523
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

650
00:53:52,107 --> 00:53:54,192
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

651
00:53:54,693 --> 00:53:57,278
Who put this armchair here?

652
00:53:59,489 --> 00:54:00,782
Are you all right?

653
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:03,326
- I'm fine.
- I'm sorry.

654
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:06,121
- I didn't get hurt.
- No, I was talking about--

655
00:54:06,663 --> 00:54:09,040
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- It's going fine.

656
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:11,751
Go back to your table.

657
00:54:12,293 --> 00:54:14,295
Go on. I can do this.

658
00:54:26,016 --> 00:54:28,018
Are you all right?

659
00:54:28,518 --> 00:54:33,690
Fine! Why are you all asking me that?
Is there something wrong?

660
00:54:34,816 --> 00:54:37,819
No, nothing is wrong.

661
00:54:38,486 --> 00:54:41,656
But--
Go to the kitchen.

662
00:54:47,787 --> 00:54:50,331
The kitchen.

663
00:54:50,999 --> 00:54:53,418
They moved everything
around tonight.

664
00:54:54,002 --> 00:54:56,254
Look where they put the kitchen.

665
00:55:08,558 --> 00:55:11,353
Peek-a-boo!
Guess who?

666
00:55:13,313 --> 00:55:15,774
It's me!
What, have you gone soft?

667
00:55:17,817 --> 00:55:19,152
Miss.

668
00:55:19,444 --> 00:55:22,364
We finally meet, Dora.

669
00:55:23,114 --> 00:55:27,744
He never introduced us.
You were scared to, weren't you?

670
00:55:28,828 --> 00:55:32,707
Now you don't need to come
with us to the brothel anymore!

671
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:37,087
I apologize if I've disrupted you.
Happiness and best wishes to all.

672
00:55:37,879 --> 00:55:39,923
You sly old dog!

673
00:55:41,966 --> 00:55:43,510
What a jolly fellow!

674
00:55:49,516 --> 00:55:52,727
Everything is just fine.
I'll pick it all up.

675
00:55:53,478 --> 00:55:55,563
I apologize.

676
00:56:09,452 --> 00:56:11,371
Princess!

677
00:56:11,913 --> 00:56:13,915
You're here too?

678
00:56:31,808 --> 00:56:33,810
Take me away.

679
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:55,790
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

680
00:56:56,374 --> 00:57:00,378
a magnificent surprise
offered by the Grand Hotel.

681
00:57:01,338 --> 00:57:03,965
The Ethiopian cake!

682
00:58:11,866 --> 00:58:14,911
Thank you!
Music, maestro!

683
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:23,670
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

684
00:58:26,089 --> 00:58:27,799
Right this way, Princess.

685
00:58:29,843 --> 00:58:31,344
But you're--

686
00:58:33,346 --> 00:58:34,973
Quickly, Princess.

687
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:02,876
But he's--

688
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:11,051
He's that jerk with the eggs!

689
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:57,639
Ferruccio!

690
00:59:58,056 --> 01:00:01,476
He's got the keys to the house,
darn it all!

691
01:00:08,483 --> 01:00:11,653
Some wire.
I can open it if I find some wire.

692
01:00:13,738 --> 01:00:17,200
I'm a whiz with wire.
My pop taught me.

693
01:00:18,034 --> 01:00:21,538
I used to make toys out of wire
when I was a kid.

694
01:00:31,631 --> 01:00:33,508
I opened it.

695
01:01:08,918 --> 01:01:10,378
Joshua!

696
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:16,259
Let's go. You're going
to make Mommy late.

697
01:01:22,474 --> 01:01:24,809
I lost my tank.

698
01:01:25,435 --> 01:01:27,896
Don't worry.
We'll find it.

699
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,149
Where did you leave the tank?

700
01:01:31,858 --> 01:01:34,277
- It's on the stairs.
- I'll get it.

701
01:01:34,861 --> 01:01:37,614
Hold the bicrycle.
I'll get it.

702
01:01:41,993 --> 01:01:43,495
Here.

703
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,498
Let's go.

704
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:51,336
- Go, Pop!
- Go slow!

705
01:01:52,087 --> 01:01:54,923
You're late for school! Go!

706
01:01:55,632 --> 01:01:58,301
There's a horse!
Two horses!

707
01:02:02,347 --> 01:02:04,724
Stop ringing that bell!
It's driving me mad!

708
01:02:05,308 --> 01:02:09,062
- It's not me, it's Joshua.
- It's not me, it's Pop!

709
01:02:09,896 --> 01:02:11,898
Stop it! Let me off!.

710
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,788
Here we are.

711
01:02:27,205 --> 01:02:28,915
See you tonight.

712
01:02:34,045 --> 01:02:36,131
Go fast, Pop!

713
01:02:50,729 --> 01:02:52,689
Can we buy this for Mommy?

714
01:02:53,231 --> 01:02:56,359
- How much does it cost?
- Fifteen lire.

715
01:02:57,068 --> 01:03:00,655
It's a fake. It's probably
a fake cake, like your tank.

716
01:03:01,448 --> 01:03:03,158
Let's go, Joshua.

717
01:03:03,658 --> 01:03:06,119
" No Jews or dogs...

718
01:03:06,745 --> 01:03:09,748
allowed."

719
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:16,963
Why aren't Jews or dogs
allowed to go in?

720
01:03:18,006 --> 01:03:20,550
They just don't want
Jews or dogs to go in.

721
01:03:21,176 --> 01:03:23,511
Everybody does what they want to.

722
01:03:24,137 --> 01:03:26,264
There's a hardware store there.

723
01:03:26,806 --> 01:03:29,893
They don't let Spanish people
or horses into his store.

724
01:03:30,602 --> 01:03:32,604
Further ahead, there's a drugstore.

725
01:03:33,104 --> 01:03:36,691
I was with a Chinese friend of mine
yesterday who had a kangaroo.

726
01:03:37,525 --> 01:03:40,820
I said, " May we?'"' No, we don't want
any Chinese or kangaroos here."

727
01:03:41,571 --> 01:03:43,782
They don't like them.
What can I tell you?

728
01:03:44,324 --> 01:03:47,118
We let everybody
into our bookshop.

729
01:03:47,786 --> 01:03:49,788
No. From now on,
we'll write it too.

730
01:03:50,288 --> 01:03:52,874
- Is there anybody you don't like?
- Spiders. What about you?

731
01:03:53,541 --> 01:03:56,127
I don't like Visigoths.
Starting tomorrow we'll write...

732
01:03:56,711 --> 01:03:59,798
" No spiders and Visigoths allowed."

733
01:04:00,465 --> 01:04:03,551
I'm sick and tired
of these Visigoths.

734
01:04:14,979 --> 01:04:16,439
Good morning.

735
01:04:16,815 --> 01:04:19,067
Everything's half price.

736
01:04:19,651 --> 01:04:22,987
- Guido Orefice?
- That's me.

737
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:27,492
- You have to come to the Prefect's.
- Again?

738
01:04:28,326 --> 01:04:30,453
- He already went.
- Let's go.

739
01:04:31,037 --> 01:04:32,080
Why?

740
01:04:36,292 --> 01:04:38,962
- Is that man with you?
- Yes. Let's go.

741
01:04:39,629 --> 01:04:41,047
All right.

742
01:04:41,423 --> 01:04:43,258
- I'm coming too.
- No.

743
01:04:43,717 --> 01:04:46,219
You stay here.
It won't take long, will it?

744
01:04:46,886 --> 01:04:48,847
Not long at all.

745
01:04:50,432 --> 01:04:53,184
Joshua, make sure
you treat the customers good!

746
01:04:53,852 --> 01:04:56,730
I'll be right back.

747
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:18,436
- I'll take this one.
- It costs five lire.

748
01:06:19,187 --> 01:06:22,982
No, it says ten lire.

749
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:26,820
Everything's half price.

750
01:06:30,156 --> 01:06:34,703
Give this to your mom
and tell her it's from Grandma.

751
01:06:35,662 --> 01:06:39,416
I've never seen
my grandma before.

752
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:43,044
- Would you like to meet her?
- Yes.

753
01:06:45,213 --> 01:06:47,048
You'll meet her tomorrow.

754
01:06:47,507 --> 01:06:49,718
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

755
01:06:50,218 --> 01:06:52,637
Because tomorrow
is your birthday...

756
01:06:53,221 --> 01:06:55,557
and your grandma will come
and bring you a nice present.

757
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:59,352
A new tank?

758
01:07:01,021 --> 01:07:02,564
No, a surprise.

759
01:07:02,981 --> 01:07:04,983
Give the letter to your mom.

760
01:07:07,277 --> 01:07:09,029
Bye, Joshua.

761
01:07:09,487 --> 01:07:11,364
You forgot your change,
Grandma.

762
01:07:20,206 --> 01:07:21,291
Thank you.

763
01:07:22,917 --> 01:07:25,337
- When are you coming?
- In an hour or so.

764
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,840
I'm going to stop by my uncle's to see
if he'll bring some leftovers.

765
01:07:31,092 --> 01:07:34,179
- Then what did Grandma say?
- She's coming tomorrow.

766
01:07:38,016 --> 01:07:39,392
It's about time!

767
01:07:39,768 --> 01:07:41,936
JEWISH STORE

768
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:45,398
- It's time for your bath now.
- I don't want to take one.

769
01:07:46,024 --> 01:07:49,069
- Go take a bath.
- I took one on Friday.

770
01:07:49,778 --> 01:07:51,446
He's right.

771
01:07:51,863 --> 01:07:53,865
You change your shirt.

772
01:07:54,366 --> 01:07:56,910
- I changed it on Thursday!
- Don't forget the flowers!

773
01:07:57,535 --> 01:08:00,080
They're outside.
I already picked them.

774
01:08:00,747 --> 01:08:04,918
- I'll come with you, Pop!
- You have to take a bath, stubborn!

775
01:08:05,835 --> 01:08:08,463
I don't want to take one!

776
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:11,091
Hurry up.
I have to go pick Grandma up.

777
01:08:20,767 --> 01:08:24,312
- Where do you want the flowers?
- Set them down. I'll be right there.

778
01:08:37,992 --> 01:08:40,120
I took one on Friday!

779
01:08:47,043 --> 01:08:49,045
Do you know where Joshua is?

780
01:08:49,587 --> 01:08:51,715
He must be in there.

781
01:08:52,298 --> 01:08:54,259
Will you put those things
in order?

782
01:08:54,801 --> 01:08:57,095
Why don't you show me the flowers?
They look so beautiful.

783
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:00,473
They are. I'll bring them right over.
You want to see the flowers?

784
01:09:01,141 --> 01:09:05,645
I'll make them come right over.
Come, flowers!

785
01:09:06,646 --> 01:09:08,314
Come, nightstand!

786
01:09:08,732 --> 01:09:11,943
Schopenhauer, willpower,
I want the nightstand to come here.

787
01:09:12,694 --> 01:09:15,405
Nightstand, come.

788
01:09:17,699 --> 01:09:20,285
Stop, nightstand!

789
01:09:20,827 --> 01:09:24,247
The nightstand seems
very dirty to me.

790
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:28,418
Good morning, Princess!

791
01:09:34,632 --> 01:09:36,801
He can already read and write?

792
01:09:37,344 --> 01:09:40,096
- For over a year now.
- You did a good job.

793
01:09:40,764 --> 01:09:42,932
We're here.

794
01:09:43,516 --> 01:09:45,602
I'll help you get out.

795
01:09:46,102 --> 01:09:48,104
No, I can do it myself.

796
01:10:10,502 --> 01:10:12,837
Dora, what's wrong?

797
01:10:38,655 --> 01:10:40,657
Are we there?

798
01:10:41,157 --> 01:10:43,702
No, it's a crossing.

799
01:10:48,081 --> 01:10:50,583
Will you tell me
where we're going now?

800
01:10:51,167 --> 01:10:53,712
What do you mean, where?

801
01:10:54,337 --> 01:10:57,424
You asked me a thousand times.
We're going...

802
01:10:58,174 --> 01:11:00,844
to the place--
What's it called?

803
01:11:01,511 --> 01:11:03,304
We're going--

804
01:11:03,763 --> 01:11:06,099
Where are we going?

805
01:11:06,725 --> 01:11:10,770
What day is it today?
Today is your birthday!

806
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:14,357
You've always said
you wanted to go on a trip!

807
01:11:14,983 --> 01:11:18,236
It took me months
to plan this whole thing.

808
01:11:20,488 --> 01:11:22,866
You know where we're going?

809
01:11:23,408 --> 01:11:26,244
I can't tell you.
I promised Mom I wouldn't tell.

810
01:11:26,995 --> 01:11:28,913
You know how she is.
She'll get mad.

811
01:11:29,372 --> 01:11:31,583
It makes me laugh.

812
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:35,712
My pop planned something like this
for me when I was little too.

813
01:11:39,883 --> 01:11:42,010
It was so--
Boy, it was funny!

814
01:11:47,474 --> 01:11:51,102
I'm not going to tell you.
I want you to see for yourself.

815
01:11:51,978 --> 01:11:55,565
It's a surprise.
You know, it's really--

816
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:57,984
It really makes me laugh.

817
01:11:59,986 --> 01:12:01,196
I'm tired.

818
01:12:01,571 --> 01:12:03,573
Go to sleep.

819
01:12:11,373 --> 01:12:14,417
Where are we going?
Where are they taking us?

820
01:12:39,734 --> 01:12:43,738
What time is it?
We're leaving right on time.

821
01:12:44,572 --> 01:12:46,449
What organization!

822
01:12:46,908 --> 01:12:49,703
- You've never taken a train, huh?
- No. Is it nice?

823
01:12:50,412 --> 01:12:51,955
It's really nice!

824
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:55,709
It's all wooden inside. Everybody
stands up. There's not one seat.

825
01:12:56,501 --> 01:13:00,005
- There aren't any seats?
- What? Seats on a train?

826
01:13:00,797 --> 01:13:03,091
It's obvious
you've never been on one!

827
01:13:03,633 --> 01:13:07,012
No, everybody
stands real close together.

828
01:13:07,804 --> 01:13:12,225
Do you see this line?
I got the last tickets just in time!

829
01:13:13,184 --> 01:13:16,688
Hurry up, Uncle Eliseo.
I don't want them to say, "Too late.

830
01:13:17,564 --> 01:13:19,232
It's full.
Go back home."

831
01:13:19,649 --> 01:13:23,319
Wait up. We've got a reservation!
Leave some room for us!

832
01:13:24,195 --> 01:13:26,197
Look at this line!

833
01:13:28,783 --> 01:13:31,703
Here we are!
We made a reservation!

834
01:13:35,457 --> 01:13:37,792
Thank you!

835
01:13:41,463 --> 01:13:46,468
- May I help you?
- There's been a mistake.

836
01:13:47,552 --> 01:13:50,180
What mistake?

837
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:53,683
My husband and son
are on that train.

838
01:13:55,727 --> 01:13:57,645
What's your husband's name?

839
01:13:58,146 --> 01:14:00,440
Guido Orefice.

840
01:14:08,531 --> 01:14:10,408
Joshua Orefice...

841
01:14:10,909 --> 01:14:15,080
and Eliseo Orefice
are on that train too.

842
01:14:15,997 --> 01:14:17,999
There's no mistake.

843
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:22,796
I want to get
on that train too.

844
01:14:25,715 --> 01:14:29,594
- We're all ready.
- Send them off then.

845
01:14:30,512 --> 01:14:31,930
Go, leave!

846
01:14:35,016 --> 01:14:38,436
Go back home, ma'am.

847
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:40,939
I want to get on that train.

848
01:14:52,409 --> 01:14:55,245
Let me get on that train!

849
01:15:34,409 --> 01:15:35,452
Mom's here!

850
01:15:39,748 --> 01:15:43,335
They stopped the train
to let Mom get on.

851
01:18:18,198 --> 01:18:19,824
Uncle Eliseo.

852
01:19:10,375 --> 01:19:13,920
Are you happy? Did you see this place?
Are you tired?

853
01:19:14,796 --> 01:19:18,341
- I didn't like the train.
- Me either.

854
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:21,428
We'll take the bus back.

855
01:19:22,012 --> 01:19:26,474
We're taking the bus back!
The one with the seats in it!

856
01:19:27,475 --> 01:19:30,437
- I told them.
- It's better.

857
01:19:32,522 --> 01:19:35,817
You see?
It's all organized!

858
01:19:36,651 --> 01:19:41,281
Did you see that line?
People are lined up to get inside!

859
01:19:42,282 --> 01:19:45,994
- Everybody wants to get in!
- What game is this?

860
01:19:46,828 --> 01:19:48,663
That's it!

861
01:19:49,122 --> 01:19:51,750
It's that game where--

862
01:19:52,334 --> 01:19:54,836
It's the game--

863
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:57,422
We're all players.

864
01:19:59,632 --> 01:20:02,344
It's all organized.
The game is...

865
01:20:02,969 --> 01:20:06,264
the men are over here,
the women are over there.

866
01:20:07,098 --> 01:20:10,393
Then there's the soldiers.
They give us our schedule.

867
01:20:11,144 --> 01:20:13,730
It's hard, you know.
It's not easy.

868
01:20:14,397 --> 01:20:18,276
If somebody makes a mistake,
they get sent right home.

869
01:20:19,194 --> 01:20:21,279
That means you have to be
very careful.

870
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:25,408
But if you win,
you get first prize!

871
01:20:26,284 --> 01:20:28,620
What's the prize?

872
01:20:29,245 --> 01:20:31,331
First prize!

873
01:20:33,583 --> 01:20:36,753
- It's a tank.
- I already have one.

874
01:20:37,545 --> 01:20:41,383
This one's a real tank!
Brand new!

875
01:20:42,258 --> 01:20:44,511
Real?

876
01:20:45,095 --> 01:20:47,931
Yes!
I didn't want to tell you.

877
01:20:57,899 --> 01:20:59,943
Where's Uncle Eliseo going?

878
01:21:00,485 --> 01:21:03,154
He's on another team.
It's all organized.

879
01:21:03,822 --> 01:21:06,032
Bye, Uncle!

880
01:21:09,953 --> 01:21:12,539
A real tank.

881
01:21:30,348 --> 01:21:32,267
What did I tell you?

882
01:21:33,852 --> 01:21:35,520
Fabulous!

883
01:21:36,021 --> 01:21:38,106
What a place!

884
01:21:38,648 --> 01:21:43,028
Hurry up or they'll steal our places.
We've got a reservation. Two singles!

885
01:21:45,196 --> 01:21:47,615
Coming through!

886
01:21:48,283 --> 01:21:50,702
There's our place!

887
01:21:57,625 --> 01:21:59,794
This is our bed.
We'll sleep real close.

888
01:22:02,881 --> 01:22:06,634
It's ugly here. It smells.
I want to be with Mommy.

889
01:22:07,469 --> 01:22:09,596
We will be!

890
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:13,016
- I'm hungry!
- We'll eat!

891
01:22:13,725 --> 01:22:17,103
Plus they're really mean here!
They yell!

892
01:22:17,937 --> 01:22:22,150
They yell because everybody wants
first prize. They have to be tough.

893
01:22:23,068 --> 01:22:28,156
- Can I see Mommy?
- When the game's over.

894
01:22:29,282 --> 01:22:30,658
When's it over?

895
01:22:33,536 --> 01:22:36,039
You have to get
a thousand points.

896
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:41,044
Whoever gets a thousand points
wins a tank.

897
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:44,631
I don't believe you.
Are we getting a snack?

898
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:47,926
A snack?

899
01:22:48,593 --> 01:22:51,554
Just ask.
We're all friends here.

900
01:22:52,222 --> 01:22:55,141
- Look who's here. What's his name?
- Bartolomeo.

901
01:22:55,892 --> 01:22:58,144
Let me ask you something.

902
01:22:58,687 --> 01:23:01,981
Did the guy who hands out
the bread and jam already come by?

903
01:23:04,359 --> 01:23:08,071
Darn it all!
We missed him by a second!

904
01:23:08,988 --> 01:23:12,617
He'll come back again though,
won't he?

905
01:23:13,451 --> 01:23:16,287
He's coming back.

906
01:23:24,671 --> 01:23:27,799
- What did he say?
- He asked if anyone speaks German.

907
01:23:28,591 --> 01:23:30,885
He's going to explain
the camp's rules.

908
01:23:35,598 --> 01:23:37,976
- Do you speak German?
- No.

909
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:53,825
The game starts now. Whoever's here
is here, whoever's not is not.

910
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:02,917
The first one to get a thousand points
wins. The prize is a tank!

911
01:24:05,086 --> 01:24:06,171
Lucky him!

912
01:24:17,265 --> 01:24:21,436
Every day we'll announce who's in
the lead from that loudspeaker.

913
01:24:22,395 --> 01:24:25,398
The one with the least points
has to wear a sign saying "jackass"...

914
01:24:26,066 --> 01:24:27,484
right here on his back.

915
01:24:36,618 --> 01:24:39,579
We play the part
of the real mean guys who yell.

916
01:24:40,246 --> 01:24:41,790
Whoever's scared loses points.

917
01:25:01,267 --> 01:25:04,938
You'll lose your points
for three things.

918
01:25:05,814 --> 01:25:08,900
One, if you cry.

919
01:25:09,609 --> 01:25:12,696
Two, if you want
to see your mommy.

920
01:25:13,363 --> 01:25:16,991
Three, if you're hungry
and you want a snack.

921
01:25:17,826 --> 01:25:19,452
Forget about it!

922
01:25:30,630 --> 01:25:33,299
It's easy to lose points
for being hungry.

923
01:25:33,967 --> 01:25:36,219
Just yesterday
I lost 40 points...

924
01:25:36,761 --> 01:25:39,681
because I absolutely had
to have a jam sandwich.

925
01:25:42,058 --> 01:25:45,770
Apricot jam!
He wanted strawberry.

926
01:25:56,072 --> 01:25:58,908
Don't ask for any lollipops.
You won't get any.

927
01:25:59,617 --> 01:26:01,244
We eat them all!

928
01:26:04,289 --> 01:26:05,832
I ate 20 of them yesterday!

929
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:11,379
What a stomachache.
But they sure were good.

930
01:26:13,465 --> 01:26:14,632
You bet.

931
01:26:25,727 --> 01:26:28,688
Sorry if I'm going so fast,
but I'm playing hide and seek.

932
01:26:29,314 --> 01:26:31,358
I have to go now
or they'll find me.

933
01:26:44,329 --> 01:26:48,500
Don't ask me anything.
Ask Bartolomeo. He knows everything.

934
01:26:49,417 --> 01:26:51,920
Don't forget to tell me
what he said too.

935
01:26:52,462 --> 01:26:54,547
A thousand points?

936
01:26:55,090 --> 01:26:57,550
I told you we're going
to have fun!

937
01:26:58,218 --> 01:27:00,512
These guys are crazy!

938
01:27:01,137 --> 01:27:05,225
This has to weigh a hundred kilos!
It's got to be 3,000 degrees in here!

939
01:27:06,142 --> 01:27:08,728
Vittorino, I can't cope anymore!

940
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:12,315
- After only the first one?
- Why, are there more to move?

941
01:27:13,066 --> 01:27:15,443
We're here until tonight!

942
01:27:16,027 --> 01:27:19,531
Bartolomeo, what happened?
Where are they taking you?

943
01:27:20,365 --> 01:27:23,159
To the hospital.
I hurt my arm.

944
01:27:25,578 --> 01:27:27,831
We're going to die here!

945
01:27:29,708 --> 01:27:32,836
I can't take it anymore!
I'm putting this down.

946
01:27:33,545 --> 01:27:36,131
I'll tell them I can't do it.
What can they do to me?

947
01:27:36,798 --> 01:27:39,467
They'll kill you!

948
01:27:43,054 --> 01:27:45,223
- Where does this thing go?
- Down there.

949
01:27:45,807 --> 01:27:48,601
Good Lord!
I'll never make it!

950
01:27:59,404 --> 01:28:01,781
It's got to be
1 0,000 degrees in here!

951
01:28:40,195 --> 01:28:41,571
Pop!

952
01:29:01,299 --> 01:29:04,386
Look here! See?
It's nice, huh?

953
01:29:08,098 --> 01:29:10,350
We're signed up.

954
01:29:10,892 --> 01:29:14,354
When I got there to sign up...

955
01:29:15,230 --> 01:29:18,108
the referee was there
and he said...

956
01:29:18,817 --> 01:29:21,653
" No, you and your son
aren't on the list.

957
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,823
You didn't pay your dues."

958
01:29:25,407 --> 01:29:27,534
I almost fell over.

959
01:29:28,076 --> 01:29:31,371
He said, "You can go home."
I said, " No, you go home!

960
01:29:32,163 --> 01:29:35,000
Joshua and I signed up.

961
01:29:35,667 --> 01:29:40,839
Give me my number!"
In fact, they gave me one. Look.

962
01:29:41,965 --> 01:29:45,844
I had them put it here, too,
just in case.

963
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:48,888
See what a nice place...

964
01:29:50,724 --> 01:29:52,851
your pop takes you to?

965
01:29:55,979 --> 01:29:58,857
Did you play with
the other kids?

966
01:29:59,524 --> 01:30:02,277
Yes, but they don't
know the rules.

967
01:30:03,903 --> 01:30:06,948
They said it isn't true that
first prize is a tank.

968
01:30:07,615 --> 01:30:09,909
They don't know anything
about the points.

969
01:30:10,535 --> 01:30:14,205
Did you fall for that?
They're as sly as foxes.

970
01:30:15,081 --> 01:30:17,208
They want to beat you!
Are you joking?

971
01:30:17,667 --> 01:30:21,463
There's no tank?
Don't you believe them!

972
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:25,383
How many points
did we get today?

973
01:30:26,134 --> 01:30:28,094
Fifty.

974
01:30:28,511 --> 01:30:31,598
Forty-eight. They took two points
away from me because...

975
01:30:32,265 --> 01:30:34,601
I tripped while I was...

976
01:30:35,185 --> 01:30:37,562
playing hopscotch.

977
01:30:39,481 --> 01:30:41,232
We...

978
01:30:41,691 --> 01:30:45,653
laughed like crazy today!
I died laughing!

979
01:30:46,571 --> 01:30:48,531
Boy, did I have fun!

980
01:30:49,074 --> 01:30:51,576
I can't wait to start
all over again tomorrow!

981
01:30:52,202 --> 01:30:56,122
Hopscotch, tug of war
and ring around the rosy.

982
01:30:56,998 --> 01:30:59,376
Every game.
I don't even remember all of them.

983
01:30:59,918 --> 01:31:03,797
"You guys are obsessed! Stop!
I'm tired!" I said.

984
01:31:04,714 --> 01:31:06,675
Listen.

985
01:31:07,217 --> 01:31:10,929
- Did you eat something?
- Yes, but I didn't ask for a snack.

986
01:31:11,805 --> 01:31:16,017
Good boy!
That means you got 1 2 points too!

987
01:31:16,935 --> 01:31:19,354
Forty-eight for me, 1 2 for you.

988
01:31:19,979 --> 01:31:21,314
Sixty points.

989
01:31:21,690 --> 01:31:25,026
This is what you get
when you get up to 60.

990
01:31:25,819 --> 01:31:29,322
A plain piece of bread,
no jam.

991
01:31:30,156 --> 01:31:32,367
Here, eat this.

992
01:31:36,037 --> 01:31:39,833
- Is 60 points a lot?
- Are you kidding?

993
01:31:40,709 --> 01:31:42,293
It sure is!

994
01:31:47,298 --> 01:31:49,926
Look who's here!
Bartolomeo!

995
01:31:50,593 --> 01:31:51,720
How'd it go?

996
01:31:53,596 --> 01:31:56,683
Any worse than this--
I got 20 of them.

997
01:32:02,105 --> 01:32:04,858
We got more than him.

998
01:32:05,483 --> 01:32:07,944
Don't tell him that.
We're in the lead!

999
01:32:20,707 --> 01:32:23,418
I already told you:
no children or old ladies!

1000
01:32:24,044 --> 01:32:27,172
Back inside!
You don't work!

1001
01:32:27,964 --> 01:32:30,633
The rest, downstairs!

1002
01:32:31,259 --> 01:32:34,346
Let's go, girls, quickly.
Come on. This way!

1003
01:32:36,598 --> 01:32:39,476
That one's new.
She learned right away.

1004
01:32:40,143 --> 01:32:43,772
The lady at the door,
she seemed nice when she first came.

1005
01:32:44,647 --> 01:32:46,566
She's the worst of all!

1006
01:32:47,067 --> 01:32:49,986
At least she didn't send
the old ladies and children to work.

1007
01:32:50,653 --> 01:32:54,366
They don't send old people and kids
to work because they kill them!

1008
01:32:55,241 --> 01:32:58,078
One of these days
they'll call them to take a shower.

1009
01:32:58,828 --> 01:33:00,747
"Children, shower time!"

1010
01:33:01,206 --> 01:33:04,876
The truth is, they make them
shower there in the gas chamber.

1011
01:33:14,844 --> 01:33:16,638
Downstairs!

1012
01:33:21,768 --> 01:33:24,729
How can I do this?

1013
01:33:25,355 --> 01:33:27,023
Vittorino!

1014
01:33:29,150 --> 01:33:31,736
Where'd they find
all these anvils?

1015
01:33:32,362 --> 01:33:34,322
Pop!

1016
01:33:36,866 --> 01:33:39,452
Why are you here?
You're not supposed to be here!

1017
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:41,913
Go away!

1018
01:33:42,414 --> 01:33:44,874
Why aren't you with
the other kids?

1019
01:33:45,458 --> 01:33:47,335
They said...

1020
01:33:47,836 --> 01:33:51,047
all us kids have to take
a shower today, and I don't want to.

1021
01:33:53,758 --> 01:33:55,802
- Go take a shower!
- No!

1022
01:33:57,512 --> 01:33:59,597
I'm not going to.

1023
01:34:00,181 --> 01:34:01,766
Go take a shower!

1024
01:34:03,476 --> 01:34:05,103
What are you doing here?

1025
01:34:08,273 --> 01:34:13,194
We're making... a tank.

1026
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:17,699
We're building the tank.
We're still working on the tracks.

1027
01:34:18,491 --> 01:34:20,452
We're running slow.

1028
01:34:22,996 --> 01:34:26,124
You can't stay here.
Go take your shower!

1029
01:34:26,875 --> 01:34:30,045
I don't want to!

1030
01:34:30,795 --> 01:34:34,716
You stubborn thing! I'll tell Mom!
Ten points off for you!

1031
01:34:35,592 --> 01:34:38,970
Hide behind there.
We'll go back together when I'm done.

1032
01:34:39,763 --> 01:34:41,723
Don't let anyone see you!

1033
01:34:42,265 --> 01:34:44,225
This sure is fun.

1034
01:35:02,285 --> 01:35:03,787
Everything!

1035
01:35:04,204 --> 01:35:06,873
Take everything off!.
Hang it up there!

1036
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:10,877
You'll get it back
after the shower.

1037
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:12,962
Forward!

1038
01:35:15,757 --> 01:35:18,343
Remember your number
to get your clothes back!

1039
01:35:23,306 --> 01:35:26,601
Women and children
will shower together.

1040
01:35:27,352 --> 01:35:29,479
Are you hurt?

1041
01:35:43,493 --> 01:35:45,537
Thanks, Bartolomeo.

1042
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:49,124
From now on, you have to
hide here the whole day.

1043
01:35:49,833 --> 01:35:52,502
If they see us now it's over.
We're disqualified.

1044
01:35:53,211 --> 01:35:55,046
What do I have to do?

1045
01:35:55,547 --> 01:35:58,008
You have to stay.
Vittorino, help me out.

1046
01:35:58,591 --> 01:36:00,719
You have to hide here all day.

1047
01:36:01,261 --> 01:36:05,849
Don't let anyone see you,
especially those mean guys who yell.

1048
01:36:06,850 --> 01:36:08,226
Remember.

1049
01:36:08,601 --> 01:36:10,562
Stay hidden!

1050
01:36:11,062 --> 01:36:13,815
This is the hardest part.

1051
01:36:14,482 --> 01:36:19,237
If we get this right, the tank is ours.
It's worth 120 points a day.

1052
01:36:20,363 --> 01:36:23,366
I'll take you with me.
I'll hide you. You're gone.

1053
01:36:24,075 --> 01:36:27,120
Who's ever seen you before?
Who are you? Where is he?

1054
01:36:27,787 --> 01:36:29,205
Got it?

1055
01:36:36,046 --> 01:36:37,380
Got it!

1056
01:36:39,924 --> 01:36:41,384
Good boy!

1057
01:38:17,897 --> 01:38:20,608
Anybody here?
Am I disturbing?

1058
01:38:31,286 --> 01:38:33,496
Come here!

1059
01:38:34,039 --> 01:38:36,124
Quick as lightning!

1060
01:38:44,049 --> 01:38:45,842
Good morning, Princess!

1061
01:38:46,343 --> 01:38:50,555
Last night,
I dreamt about you all night!

1062
01:38:51,556 --> 01:38:56,102
We were going to the movies.
You were wearing that pink suit...

1063
01:38:57,103 --> 01:38:58,813
that I really like.

1064
01:38:59,272 --> 01:39:01,733
You're all I think about,
Princess.

1065
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:05,111
I always think about you.
And now--

1066
01:39:05,737 --> 01:39:07,322
Mommy!

1067
01:39:07,781 --> 01:39:11,993
Pop wheels me in the wheelbarrow,
but he doesn't know how to drive!

1068
01:39:12,952 --> 01:39:14,454
We laugh like crazy!

1069
01:39:14,913 --> 01:39:18,917
We're in the lead!
How many points do we have today?

1070
01:39:19,793 --> 01:39:23,213
Run! The mean guys
Who yell are behind us!

1071
01:39:24,005 --> 01:39:26,591
- Where?
- Over here! Come on!

1072
01:39:44,234 --> 01:39:46,194
Are they dry?

1073
01:39:48,780 --> 01:39:50,407
They're dry.

1074
01:39:50,907 --> 01:39:52,701
Catch.

1075
01:39:53,201 --> 01:39:54,869
Get dressed.

1076
01:40:13,013 --> 01:40:16,725
What happened to Vittorino,
Alfonso and the others?

1077
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:20,020
They didn't make it.

1078
01:41:25,919 --> 01:41:29,631
"If you say my name,
I'm not there anymore."

1079
01:41:30,465 --> 01:41:31,883
Silence.

1080
01:42:13,591 --> 01:42:16,428
Thank goodness. I was getting scared.
What happened to you?

1081
01:42:17,137 --> 01:42:19,472
They're half crazy!

1082
01:42:23,018 --> 01:42:25,270
The man who does the check-ups,
the Captain--

1083
01:42:25,895 --> 01:42:28,857
He's a friend of mine.
I met him when I was a waiter.

1084
01:42:29,524 --> 01:42:33,862
He said they're having a dinner
with all the officials and their wives.

1085
01:42:34,821 --> 01:42:38,408
He asked me if I wanted to
wait tables at the dinner.

1086
01:42:39,284 --> 01:42:43,329
Maybe he wants to help me.
He might get us out of here.

1087
01:42:52,172 --> 01:42:54,424
Have you seen Joshua?

1088
01:42:55,008 --> 01:42:57,010
What do you mean, no?

1089
01:43:06,561 --> 01:43:08,730
What are you doing?
Come here!

1090
01:43:09,314 --> 01:43:13,693
- No.
- I told you to come.

1091
01:43:14,694 --> 01:43:16,321
No? Come on out!

1092
01:43:18,031 --> 01:43:20,575
Come out! Look here.
You're all dirty.

1093
01:43:22,452 --> 01:43:23,870
Where have you been?

1094
01:43:25,663 --> 01:43:28,291
I had to finish playing rummy.

1095
01:43:30,001 --> 01:43:33,296
They make buttons and soap
out of us.

1096
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:40,553
- What are you saying?
- They burn us all in the oven.

1097
01:43:42,555 --> 01:43:45,058
Who told you that?

1098
01:43:45,642 --> 01:43:50,689
A man was crying. He said they make
buttons and soap out of us.

1099
01:43:54,943 --> 01:43:57,237
You fell for that?

1100
01:43:57,821 --> 01:44:00,156
Again?

1101
01:44:00,657 --> 01:44:04,160
I thought you were a sharp boy--
cunning, intelligent.

1102
01:44:04,953 --> 01:44:09,082
Buttons and soap out of people?
That'll be the day!

1103
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,585
You believed that?

1104
01:44:14,212 --> 01:44:18,425
Just imagine. Tomorrow morning,
I wash my hands with Bartolomeo...

1105
01:44:19,426 --> 01:44:21,136
a good scrub.

1106
01:44:21,553 --> 01:44:24,472
Then I'll button up
with Francesco.

1107
01:44:25,223 --> 01:44:26,516
Darn it all!

1108
01:44:26,850 --> 01:44:29,519
Look! I just lost Giorgio!

1109
01:44:30,228 --> 01:44:32,605
Does this look like a person?

1110
01:44:33,148 --> 01:44:36,317
Come on! They were teasing you!
And you fell for it!

1111
01:44:37,110 --> 01:44:39,404
What else did they tell you?

1112
01:44:40,030 --> 01:44:41,990
That we get cooked in the oven.

1113
01:44:47,412 --> 01:44:49,456
They burn us up in the oven.

1114
01:44:54,461 --> 01:44:57,756
You fell for that too!
You just eat everything up!

1115
01:44:58,465 --> 01:45:00,884
I've heard of a wood oven...

1116
01:45:01,509 --> 01:45:03,595
but I've never seen
a man oven before.

1117
01:45:05,180 --> 01:45:09,142
"I'm made of wood!"
"Take this lawyer!"

1118
01:45:10,060 --> 01:45:12,645
"This lawyer doesn't burn.
He's not dry enough.

1119
01:45:13,271 --> 01:45:14,981
Look at that smoke!"

1120
01:45:17,275 --> 01:45:20,195
Buttons, soap,
we get burned in the oven.

1121
01:45:20,862 --> 01:45:23,031
Let's be serious now.

1122
01:45:23,615 --> 01:45:26,493
I have a bag race
with the bad guys tomorrow.

1123
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:30,872
That's enough.
I want to go home.

1124
01:45:33,917 --> 01:45:36,670
- Now?
- Right now.

1125
01:45:37,379 --> 01:45:40,757
It's raining now. You'll come down
with a terrible fever!

1126
01:45:41,508 --> 01:45:43,468
I don't care.
Let's go.

1127
01:45:45,512 --> 01:45:48,139
All right.
If you want to go--

1128
01:45:50,225 --> 01:45:52,227
I'll get our stuff
and we'll leave.

1129
01:45:54,187 --> 01:45:56,606
- We can leave?
- Naturally.

1130
01:45:57,190 --> 01:45:59,776
What do you think they do,
force people to stay here?

1131
01:46:00,402 --> 01:46:02,529
That'll be the day.

1132
01:46:03,071 --> 01:46:06,199
Wouldn't that be great?
Let's go. We'll pack our bags...

1133
01:46:06,991 --> 01:46:09,786
and get out of here.

1134
01:46:10,453 --> 01:46:14,416
What a shame. We were in the lead.
We're quitting. Off the list we go.

1135
01:46:15,250 --> 01:46:18,461
Some other kid
will win the real tank.

1136
01:46:19,170 --> 01:46:22,298
There aren't any other kids.
I'm the only one left.

1137
01:46:23,049 --> 01:46:26,428
There aren't any more kids?
It's chock-full of them here!

1138
01:46:27,220 --> 01:46:28,805
Where are they then?

1139
01:46:29,222 --> 01:46:32,142
They're all hiding.
Nobody's supposed to see them.

1140
01:46:32,851 --> 01:46:37,022
- This is a serious game!
- I just don't get it.

1141
01:46:37,939 --> 01:46:40,025
How many points do we have?

1142
01:46:40,608 --> 01:46:42,777
Almost 687.

1143
01:46:43,361 --> 01:46:45,447
I told you a thousand times.

1144
01:46:46,823 --> 01:46:48,324
Let's go, though.

1145
01:46:48,742 --> 01:46:51,870
- We're winning, but if you want--
- We're winning?

1146
01:46:52,579 --> 01:46:57,208
We're first, I told you.
But we'll quit if you want.

1147
01:46:59,252 --> 01:47:02,339
I saw the chart yesterday.
We'll go anyway, though.

1148
01:47:03,089 --> 01:47:05,091
Bye, Bartolomeo.
Joshua and I are leaving.

1149
01:47:05,592 --> 01:47:07,510
We're fed up here.

1150
01:47:10,013 --> 01:47:12,682
The tank is done.
It's ready.

1151
01:47:13,350 --> 01:47:16,353
Clean the spark plugs off
before you start it.

1152
01:47:17,103 --> 01:47:19,898
Open the throttle...

1153
01:47:20,565 --> 01:47:23,818
otherwise the cannon will
get stuck with the tracks.

1154
01:47:24,611 --> 01:47:28,990
And the gun. Did you see
how nice it is? It came out beautiful!

1155
01:47:29,949 --> 01:47:33,912
Lift the emergency brake off
before you move! We're going.

1156
01:47:34,788 --> 01:47:36,956
Joshua wants to quit.

1157
01:47:37,499 --> 01:47:41,169
We could have gone back with a tank
soon, but we'll take the bus today.

1158
01:47:42,003 --> 01:47:44,422
Joshua and I are leaving.
So long, everybody!

1159
01:47:45,006 --> 01:47:47,008
We're tired of this place.

1160
01:47:47,550 --> 01:47:50,387
Let's go or we'll miss the bus.

1161
01:47:58,269 --> 01:47:59,813
Let's go, Joshua.

1162
01:48:04,359 --> 01:48:08,321
It's raining. I'll come down
with a terrible fever!

1163
01:49:37,077 --> 01:49:39,454
It's me, Pop!

1164
01:49:40,038 --> 01:49:43,333
I have to tell you
something important! Come here!

1165
01:49:44,125 --> 01:49:46,920
That little rascal's been
running away all morning.

1166
01:49:47,629 --> 01:49:50,423
- Is there really a kid?
- There must be two thousand!

1167
01:49:51,091 --> 01:49:53,301
They're like mice.
They hide all over the place!

1168
01:49:53,885 --> 01:49:56,763
Those creeps want our tank!
Stop!

1169
01:49:57,472 --> 01:49:58,932
Wait.

1170
01:50:01,476 --> 01:50:03,561
I might have spotted him.

1171
01:50:04,104 --> 01:50:06,648
I think he's nearby.

1172
01:50:07,273 --> 01:50:11,444
Look. Go see if he's hiding in there.
I'll wait here.

1173
01:50:12,445 --> 01:50:14,572
I'll keep a watch out.

1174
01:50:23,123 --> 01:50:24,833
He's there, Pop!

1175
01:50:25,291 --> 01:50:27,502
- What'd he look like? Blond?
- Yes.

1176
01:50:28,086 --> 01:50:30,839
That's him then.
His name is... Schwanz.

1177
01:50:31,506 --> 01:50:33,800
He's been in there
for three weeks.

1178
01:50:34,384 --> 01:50:37,053
He was the runner up.
We beat him, though!

1179
01:50:37,762 --> 01:50:40,724
Sooner or later,
I'll find the others too.

1180
01:50:41,433 --> 01:50:44,144
- How many are there?
- It's swarming, I told you.

1181
01:50:44,811 --> 01:50:46,604
They're all hidden.

1182
01:50:58,742 --> 01:51:01,786
- Look, Pop!
- There's a hideout!

1183
01:51:04,914 --> 01:51:07,000
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha!
You're out! Let's go.

1184
01:51:16,718 --> 01:51:20,221
- Holy smokes! She saw us!
- Are we out?

1185
01:51:21,014 --> 01:51:23,558
She's coming over for you.

1186
01:51:24,184 --> 01:51:26,144
Now it's time for
the "be quiet" game.

1187
01:51:26,686 --> 01:51:29,689
You're never to speak.

1188
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:32,233
Swear it!

1189
01:51:33,985 --> 01:51:36,154
- Swear it!
- I swear.

1190
01:51:40,367 --> 01:51:42,952
They all talk strange.
You can't understand a word.

1191
01:51:43,620 --> 01:51:46,289
If we get through this,
the first prize is ours.

1192
01:51:46,915 --> 01:51:50,085
They're rounding up everyone in
first place. It's the silence game.

1193
01:51:50,794 --> 01:51:52,128
Not a word, got it?

1194
01:52:02,347 --> 01:52:04,349
Why are you here
with the children?

1195
01:52:04,849 --> 01:52:06,851
Quiet!
You're never to speak.

1196
01:52:09,020 --> 01:52:10,355
I swear.

1197
01:53:20,759 --> 01:53:23,845
I have to talk to you.
Very important.

1198
01:53:24,596 --> 01:53:27,766
- Where? When?
- I'll signal you. Later.

1199
01:53:44,866 --> 01:53:46,242
Thank you.

1200
01:54:44,551 --> 01:54:47,178
I told you not to talk
to the children.

1201
01:55:22,505 --> 01:55:25,383
Doctor, my wife is here too.

1202
01:55:54,162 --> 01:55:55,747
Slowly.

1203
01:55:56,206 --> 01:55:58,875
Eat slowly.
It's bad for you.

1204
01:55:59,501 --> 01:56:03,755
We're in the lead.
We just might leave early.

1205
01:56:04,756 --> 01:56:07,050
The game finishes early.

1206
01:56:07,676 --> 01:56:10,804
Don't make a mistake
now that we're in the lead.

1207
01:56:11,513 --> 01:56:12,972
Slowly.

1208
01:56:41,084 --> 01:56:43,086
So.
Pay attention.

1209
01:56:50,635 --> 01:56:54,764
" Fat, fat, ugly, ugly,
all yellow in reality.

1210
01:56:57,726 --> 01:56:59,853
If you ask me what I am...

1211
01:57:00,437 --> 01:57:03,273
I answer, 'Cheep, cheep, cheep.'

1212
01:57:10,989 --> 01:57:14,701
Walking along I go,
'Poo poo'.

1213
01:57:15,535 --> 01:57:18,163
Who am I?
Tell me true."

1214
01:57:24,294 --> 01:57:26,212
A duckling, right?

1215
01:57:30,467 --> 01:57:32,427
Is it a duckling?

1216
01:57:34,846 --> 01:57:37,515
It's not!

1217
01:57:39,351 --> 01:57:42,812
A veterinarian friend of mine
sent it to me from Vienna.

1218
01:57:43,646 --> 01:57:46,232
I can't send him mine...

1219
01:57:46,858 --> 01:57:49,444
until I solve this one.

1220
01:57:51,321 --> 01:57:53,448
I thought...

1221
01:57:54,032 --> 01:57:56,368
duck-billed platypus...

1222
01:57:56,951 --> 01:57:59,079
but it doesn't go,
"Cheep, cheep, cheep."

1223
01:57:59,579 --> 01:58:01,998
A duck-billed platypus goes--

1224
01:58:09,673 --> 01:58:13,551
I translated it into Italian
for you last night.

1225
01:58:16,846 --> 01:58:18,807
Well, what do you say?

1226
01:58:21,976 --> 01:58:24,479
Everything points
to a duckling.

1227
01:58:27,857 --> 01:58:29,651
Help me.

1228
01:58:34,531 --> 01:58:36,741
For heaven's sake...

1229
01:58:37,283 --> 01:58:39,536
help me.

1230
01:58:40,161 --> 01:58:42,497
I can't even sleep.

1231
01:59:03,893 --> 01:59:06,438
It's the duckling!

1232
02:02:09,079 --> 02:02:10,872
Come here!

1233
02:02:14,084 --> 02:02:16,836
- I'm tired.
- Come here.

1234
02:02:24,969 --> 02:02:26,930
Where are we here?

1235
02:02:27,430 --> 02:02:30,392
I might have taken
the wrong way.

1236
02:02:31,101 --> 02:02:34,354
Good boy, sleep.
Dream sweet dreams.

1237
02:02:35,146 --> 02:02:37,607
Maybe it's only a dream!

1238
02:02:38,191 --> 02:02:40,402
We're dreaming, Joshua.

1239
02:02:40,985 --> 02:02:43,613
Tomorrow morning
Mommy will come wake us up...

1240
02:02:44,239 --> 02:02:48,702
and bring us two nice cups
of milk and cookies.

1241
02:02:49,744 --> 02:02:51,913
First, we'll eat.

1242
02:02:52,497 --> 02:02:55,583
Then I'll make love to her
two or three times...

1243
02:02:57,252 --> 02:02:58,878
if I can.

1244
02:04:00,690 --> 02:04:02,942
Excuse me, Bartolomeo.

1245
02:04:03,485 --> 02:04:07,280
They've called those two officers
20 times. I bet they escaped.

1246
02:04:08,073 --> 02:04:12,577
- Did you understand anything else?
- It's clear enough.

1247
02:04:13,620 --> 02:04:16,373
The war is over.
They're running all over the place.

1248
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:19,626
Where are those trucks going?

1249
02:04:20,293 --> 02:04:23,171
The important thing is
not to get on those trucks.

1250
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:26,174
They leave full
and come back empty.

1251
02:04:26,716 --> 02:04:28,718
You know where they're going?

1252
02:04:31,012 --> 02:04:33,390
What about the women?
What's going on?

1253
02:04:33,973 --> 02:04:37,018
Let's get out of this dump
and split up.

1254
02:04:37,727 --> 02:04:39,979
We don't even have
to pack our bags!

1255
02:04:40,522 --> 02:04:43,274
I've been hearing
only dogs and machine guns.

1256
02:04:43,942 --> 02:04:47,362
- They want to get rid of everything.
- I'm leaving.

1257
02:04:48,071 --> 02:04:51,783
See you in Viareggio.
We'll start an anvil factoy!

1258
02:04:52,617 --> 02:04:54,077
So long, guys.
I'm leaving.

1259
02:05:16,224 --> 02:05:18,018
Come see.

1260
02:05:18,518 --> 02:05:21,354
Look how mad they are!
Furious!

1261
02:05:23,523 --> 02:05:25,984
You see?
They're looking for you.

1262
02:05:26,609 --> 02:05:28,820
Just for you.
All this is over you!

1263
02:05:29,320 --> 02:05:31,406
You're the last one!
The last one to find!

1264
02:05:31,948 --> 02:05:35,368
They're even looking
under the rocks!

1265
02:05:36,161 --> 02:05:39,039
The game is over tomorrow.
They'll give the award.

1266
02:05:39,748 --> 02:05:43,209
If they don't find you tonight,
it's worth 60 points!

1267
02:05:43,960 --> 02:05:45,837
How many points do we have?

1268
02:05:46,296 --> 02:05:49,507
We've got 940 points.
Plus 60?

1269
02:05:50,258 --> 02:05:52,677
- A thousand!
- First place! We win!

1270
02:05:53,261 --> 02:05:55,805
They're looking
all over for you.

1271
02:05:56,431 --> 02:05:58,892
No mistakes tonight.
This is it!

1272
02:05:59,476 --> 02:06:03,063
- Go hide in that box, quick!
- Schwanz is in there.

1273
02:06:03,938 --> 02:06:05,857
Who?

1274
02:06:06,316 --> 02:06:08,777
The blond boy.

1275
02:06:12,113 --> 02:06:14,741
They got him yesterday.
He was eliminated.

1276
02:06:15,367 --> 02:06:18,286
It's the safest place to hide.
Nobody will look.

1277
02:06:18,953 --> 02:06:21,956
Let's go, quick as lightning.
Come on!

1278
02:06:26,961 --> 02:06:28,963
Inside!

1279
02:06:29,464 --> 02:06:32,550
Take this blanket
in case you get cold.

1280
02:06:33,259 --> 02:06:35,595
I'll be back soon.

1281
02:06:36,137 --> 02:06:39,724
I'll put them on the wrong track.
I think I saw him over there!

1282
02:07:17,345 --> 02:07:20,890
Pop, you scared me to death!

1283
02:07:21,766 --> 02:07:23,893
Give me the blanket.
Are you cold?

1284
02:07:24,477 --> 02:07:26,438
Give me your sweater then.

1285
02:07:26,980 --> 02:07:30,150
I'll throw it on a tree
and put them off track.

1286
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:34,029
They're looking all over for you!

1287
02:07:34,779 --> 02:07:37,532
Everybody's yelling,
"Where's Joshua?"

1288
02:07:38,158 --> 02:07:41,995
They're even cursing.
They're really, really mad!

1289
02:07:42,871 --> 02:07:46,332
No one will find you.
Bye, now. I'll be back later.

1290
02:07:48,209 --> 02:07:50,086
Listen...

1291
02:07:50,587 --> 02:07:53,882
if I'm really late coming back...

1292
02:07:54,674 --> 02:07:56,593
don't you move.

1293
02:07:57,052 --> 02:08:00,472
Don't come out.
You're not to come out...

1294
02:08:01,264 --> 02:08:04,893
until it's completely quiet...

1295
02:08:05,769 --> 02:08:08,063
and nobody is in sight,
just to be safe.

1296
02:08:08,605 --> 02:08:10,023
Say it!

1297
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:13,902
I won't come out
until nobody is around.

1298
02:08:14,736 --> 02:08:16,863
Good boy, stubborn.

1299
02:08:53,483 --> 02:08:54,984
Leave!

1300
02:08:55,402 --> 02:08:57,654
Go away, dog!

1301
02:08:58,154 --> 02:09:00,281
Go, dog!

1302
02:09:00,824 --> 02:09:02,283
Leave.

1303
02:09:18,758 --> 02:09:20,468
Good job, Ferruccio.

1304
02:09:20,885 --> 02:09:22,971
It works.

1305
02:09:54,252 --> 02:09:56,463
Is there anyone
called Dora here?

1306
02:10:46,930 --> 02:10:49,057
Dora, are you here?
It's Guido.

1307
02:10:50,850 --> 02:10:54,437
I know someone is hiding here.
Is there a Dora here?

1308
02:11:06,950 --> 02:11:10,036
Is there a Dora here?
She's Italian. She's my wife.

1309
02:11:10,745 --> 02:11:13,873
Yes, there's a Dora here.

1310
02:11:15,709 --> 02:11:17,711
It's me, Dora!

1311
02:11:19,879 --> 02:11:22,215
It's not her!
Is there another Dora?

1312
02:11:22,799 --> 02:11:25,176
Jump out of the truck
as soon as you can!

1313
02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:28,221
Get off!. Jump out!

1314
02:18:06,661 --> 02:18:08,705
It's true!

1315
02:19:49,097 --> 02:19:50,682
Mommy!

1316
02:20:05,363 --> 02:20:08,324
This is my story.

1317
02:20:10,827 --> 02:20:13,663
This is the sacrifice
my father made.

1318
02:20:17,083 --> 02:20:19,502
This was his gift tome.

1319
02:20:20,128 --> 02:20:22,630
- We won!
- Yes, we won!

1320
02:20:25,800 --> 02:20:28,970
A thousand points
to laugh like crazy about!

1321
02:20:30,972 --> 02:20:34,851
We came in first!
We're taking the tank home!

1322
02:20:35,810 --> 02:20:38,313
We won!
