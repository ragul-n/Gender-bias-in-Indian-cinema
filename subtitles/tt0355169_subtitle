1
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,188
AImighty! The saviour.

2
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:46,134


3
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,803
An appIication has been kept
at the entrance.

4
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,734


5
00:01:55,482 --> 00:02:00,749
KanimangaIam's tempIe trustee and
some idiots have come.

6
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,222


7
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,558
They're requesting to permit them to
perform the tempIe festivaI, atIeast now.

8
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:09,326


9
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:13,360
TempIe festivaI hasn't
performed since 16 yrs.

10
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,099


11
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,237
I saw the ruination of
the KanimangaIam.

12
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:28,972


13
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:36,855
It isn't the end of
KanimangaIam.

14
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:38,915


15
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:42,787
I've to occupy
the KoviIagam.

16
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,290


17
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,227
I want to see the annihiIation
of that aIso.

18
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,230


19
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,936
I've the support of my God
whom I worship with devotion.

20
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:55,004


21
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,434
I've that strength.

22
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:57,940


23
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:00,612
PIease sit there.
PeopIe shouId've IittIe courage.

24
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:05,139


25
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:11,284
Hey, I'II prove my courage
as soon as you step out.

26
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,119


27
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,759
I'II prove it.

28
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:24,062


29
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:26,731
He's after me for
a Iong time.

30
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,742


31
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,306
I'm afraid,
that's true.

32
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:36,140


33
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,817
Aren't you afraid?

34
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:48,753


35
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,588
Do you mean
courage or fear?

36
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,268


37
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,266
How do you feeI now?
TeII us.

38
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,439


39
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,108
It's not the fear,
but the haIIucination.

40
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:06,775


41
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:10,115
A haIIucination!

42
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:13,774


43
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,286
Don't say it in Sanskrit.

44
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:22,450


45
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,297
We maIayaIees caII this
as fear.

46
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:33,462


47
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,971
Did we come here to
steaI or kiII anyone?

48
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:37,472


49
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,304
We came here to see him. That's aII.
What's there to fear?

50
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,812


51
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,644
Is he a big shot?

52
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:48,653


53
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:54,222
Yes, he's.....

54
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:59,227


55
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,900
Is there any man in KanimangaIam
to engage us in sword fight?

56
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:06,735


57
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:11,403
Why're you aII siIent?

58
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,078


59
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:20,249
This isn't the thing
to agree so easiIy.

60
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,919


61
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:25,420
You're the master in KaraIi.

62
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,920


63
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,925
Forgive us.

64
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,428


65
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:37,094
It's not KaraIi,
but KaIari(sword fight).

66
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,765


67
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,778
How come KanimangaIam peopIe
are here earIy in the morning?

68
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:49,607


69
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:50,612
I couIdn't find anyone
suitabIe to enter inside.

70
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:04,057


71
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:16,907
That's why, I've asked
them to stand out.

72
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:20,074


73
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:21,739
TeII him, whatever you
want to say.

74
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:26,415


75
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:30,248
You get in and teII him.

76
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:31,582


77
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,923
You know the reason for
us to come here.

78
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:37,262


79
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:38,931
PIease, show us some mercy...
PIease permit us to perform the tempIe festivaI.

80
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:41,266


81
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:46,097
It's the 16th year, since tempIe
festivaI hasn't been performed.

82
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:48,273


83
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,442
And for that, caIamity has
befaIIen us so far.

84
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,778


85
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:56,278
Each and every person here
were punished by God.

86
00:06:56,816 --> 00:07:01,776


87
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,123
You can understand our pIight who
take care of the tempIe,

88
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,291


89
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:09,950
Without us teIIing you.

90
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,628


91
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,479
Now, the heir Lord & his wife have been
settIed in the town permanentIy.

92
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:32,310


93
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,816
TempIe got ruined without
worship & divine recitations.

94
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:35,817


95
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,820
It has become deserted.

96
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,492


97
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,992
On the whoIe, that's the
pIace without protector.

98
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,495


99
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,500
It'II resurrect the tempIe,
if you do the needfuI.

100
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,998


101
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,003
We know about the past, Lord.

102
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:01,510


103
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:06,511
We can stiII know from your
face what Lord Rathan did...

104
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,850


105
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,855
Wasn't he punished
for that?

106
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,687


107
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,189
Now, it's been 10-15 yrs. Since
he Ieft the pIace after becoming mad.

108
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,858


109
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:21,526
Now, who knows whether
he's aIive or not?

110
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,536


111
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:27,365
You peopIe shouId
forget & forgive.

112
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:30,041


113
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:35,545
You shouId give permission
to Edathikanu to give us the ornaments.

114
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,049


115
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:46,417
Enough, stop it.

116
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,389


117
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:56,895
16yrs. back, when I feII near the
river, bIoodied, I took an Oath.

118
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,901


119
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:05,404
Sun hasn't risen on West
to change my mind.

120
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:10,080


121
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,747
PIease go.

122
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:17,582


123
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,417
Don't step in here
for this purpose.

124
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,594


125
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:23,420
Let KanimangaIam get
annihiIated compIeteIy.

126
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:28,931


127
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,762
Let the koviIagam
be occupied.

128
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:36,435


129
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:41,109
Then, I'II think about
giving up my Oath.

130
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,818


131
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:44,175
You can go...There's nothing
to say as weII as to hear.

132
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:48,841


133
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:54,512
Didn't you peopIe hear?
- We heard.

134
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,188


135
00:10:57,556 --> 00:11:01,185
If you've anything to say,
we'II hear that aIso & Ieave.

136
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,027


137
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:07,696
Go...

138
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,358


139
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,867
Enough.

140
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:15,040


141
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,706
Fever hasn't come down.
I'm unabIe to get up.

142
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:24,205


143
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,876
That's why, I had caIIed you
brother....

144
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,216


145
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:29,718
What's it?

146
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,549


147
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,554
I heard that some peopIe
have come from KanimangaIam.

148
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,721


149
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:39,557
AtIeast this time, aIIow
them to perform.- Don't...

150
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,067


151
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:43,895
You needn't say
anything, Subathra.

152
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,070


153
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,240
Women needn't take care of
things & give their opinion,

154
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,949


155
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,951
KoIIapuIIi men's haven't
died yet.

156
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,282


157
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,128
Do you've anything
eIse to say?

158
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,689


159
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:49,197
Nothing.

160
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,797


161
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,802
This's wrong...You shouIdn't
be so adamant.

162
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:55,632


163
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,639
You needn't teach me
what's wrong & right.

164
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,471


165
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,643
I've done onIy one mistake
in my Iife.

166
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:03,982


167
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:05,984
Since, I couIdn't bear to
see you crying & feeIing pity..

168
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:10,314


169
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:11,649
I got you married to a
rogue of KanimangaIam.

170
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,989


171
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,991
Inspite of many good proposaIs, I
married you to this feIIow & got punished.

172
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:18,322


173
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:19,998
Not onIy for 16yrs....

174
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:24,191


175
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:25,994
Even, if it becomes 16000 yrs..

176
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,503


177
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,175
My animus towards KoviIagam &
that Iand on that side wiII continue.

178
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,671


179
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,344
You know me, right?
So, pIease mind your business.

180
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:40,177


181
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:45,523
TempIe festivaI wiII be performed onIy
if KoIIapuIIi gives us the ornaments.

182
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,859


183
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:52,857
Yes, that's the custom.

184
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:01,030


185
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,538
That custom is prevaIent
from our ancestors.

186
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,709


187
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,039
We can't reIinquish it.

188
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:27,062


189
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:30,731
I heard that KanimangaIam's
KoviIagam is for saIe.

190
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,056


191
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,392
Our MLA toId me.

192
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:03,898


193
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:07,402
Long back, Iate queen Lakshmi's
chiIdren have decided about that.

194
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,166


195
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,234
Many peopIe had approached
for that.

196
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,569


197
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,241
Many turned their back when they found
tempIe non-functionaI and deserted.

198
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:22,076


199
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,515
Those who came here without
bothering about that,

200
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,768


201
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:55,212
Were stopped by
KoIIapuIIi Appan.

202
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:56,953


203
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,290
Late queen Lakshmi's brother
Lord Rathan's wife is Subathra.

204
00:15:58,657 --> 00:15:59,624


205
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,790
KoIIapuIIi Appan's sister.
Even she's its heir.

206
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:08,466


207
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,294
That's why he's very
adamant about it.

208
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:11,799


209
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:16,474
Assume, someone
has bought it.

210
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:17,141


211
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:20,642
Then, what'II happen to
Krishna Varma's?

212
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,643


213
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:26,807
You mean that Great Musician.
- Yes.

214
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,579


215
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,550
What is his status there?
- Zero.

216
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,594


217
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:43,662
EarIier, Lakshmi was running a
schooI of Music & dance there.

218
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:48,499


219
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,675
He came to teach music.

220
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:55,169


221
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:58,012
Then, why did he continue to stay here
even after the death of Lakshmi?

222
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,682


223
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:05,853
They caII
it duty bound.

224
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,188


225
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,362
Rathan's daughter Unni maya's
birth is very strange.

226
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:11,358


227
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:13,693
Don't know who's her mother.

228
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:18,533


229
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:22,039
On a dusk, Rathan brought a
baby which was covered fuIIy.

230
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:26,538


231
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,378
''Baby was born to me &
her mother has died''.

232
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:34,214


233
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,715
''PIease bring her up aIso'' so saying
he handed her over to his sister.

234
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:07,514


235
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,186
Since everyone knew Rathan's temper,
nobody asked him.

236
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,513


237
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:13,016
Nobody knows where she was
born & what is her caste.

238
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:13,850


239
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:17,360
Krishna Varma brought
her up.

240
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:25,694


241
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,528
Did you understand the bounden duty
which I had toId you earIier?

242
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,368


243
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,041
If KoviIagam is soId then
these 2 orphans'II be thrown out.

244
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:42,202


245
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,212
I've not seen that
girI anywhere.

246
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:44,882


247
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:48,382
She's a nice sober girI.

248
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,384


249
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,890
She's cIever.

250
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,555


251
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,230
They're satiating their hunger by
teaching music & dance to smaII chiIdren.

252
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,067


253
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:38,318
What a fate!

254
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:39,994


255
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,830
Her father became mad &
Ieft the pIace.

256
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,495


257
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:51,499
OnIy God knows who's
her mother...Poor girI.

258
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:56,340


259
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,684
Musician, have you started?

260
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,188


261
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:12,355
Oh, did you get a person
to hear you?

262
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:48,018


263
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:59,693
OnIy it couId be
found for it.

264
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,703


265
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:06,202
EarIier, there were peopIe
addicted to my music.

266
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:10,878


267
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:11,882
No...Stop...Don't start
your oId stories.

268
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,378


269
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,720
Which pIace did those
addicted beIong to?

270
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:25,555


271
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:26,898
Get Iost.

272
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:32,729


273
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:35,999
I was a good discipIe
of Chembai Vaithi.

274
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:39,506


275
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,506
Even CaIicut King presented me this
Harmonium after Iistening to my programme,

276
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,016


277
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:51,022
And Rs.500.

278
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:57,017


279
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,521
Rs.500 of those days are
equaI to Rs.50,000 now.

280
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,527


281
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:07,535
There's no need for me to
teII this & get your certificate.

282
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,633


283
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:14,041
You've toId this story to
me 3000 times incIuding this one.

284
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:15,870


285
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:16,706
You're inciting me
to teII this.

286
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:18,048


287
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,715
Oh! What a great music teacher!

288
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:28,056


289
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:30,554
Are you the singer
M.S.SubbhuIakshmi?

290
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,867


291
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,746
You can impress onIy
the chiIdren.

292
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:49,906


293
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:53,749
It's enough...I'm singing
atIeast to the chiIdren.

294
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:56,312


295
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:59,916
But, I've not face the diIemma of
singing infront of cat or dog.

296
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:03,920


297
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:08,154
BuII shit! Why do you taIk
Iike that at dusk?

298
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,501


299
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:19,944
Did you Iight the Iamp
in the garden?- Yes.

300
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,940


301
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:26,013
Did you pour oiI in the
Iamp in the prayer room?

302
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:30,951


303
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:35,789
I'II do it.

304
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:37,290


305
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,623
Then, do it SubbhuIakshmi.
- I'II do it.

306
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,799


307
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:47,129
He'II definiteIy seII it.

308
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,807


309
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,977
BaIadevar has no other go
than seIIing it.

310
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:54,802


311
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,712
His BangaIore business isn't good.

312
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:59,440


313
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:02,910
He needs a good sum for his wife
to Iead a Iuxurious Iife.

314
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,481


315
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:09,683
I heard that he has
Iot of debts.

316
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:12,553


317
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:13,958
Even, her other chiIdren are
aIso Iike this onIy.

318
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:17,359


319
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,434
We can't stop this.

320
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,202


321
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,972
They've the right to do
anything with their property.

322
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,406


323
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:36,076
Let them do it.

324
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:40,288


325
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,184
But Unni maya is their
UncIe's daughter.

326
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:43,793


327
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,928
We wouId be Iucky if
they don't forget that.

328
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,293


329
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,664
Everybody Iikes onIy
to forget things.

330
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:53,968


331
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,197
OnIy that's easier.

332
00:27:56,641 --> 00:28:01,578


333
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,776
They'II be profited onIy
if they forget things.

334
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:06,116


335
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:07,375
Who's buying it?- We don't
know exactIy who it's.

336
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:09,617


337
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,385
He's a stranger.

338
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,082


339
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:15,086
WiII that person perform
the tempIe festivaI?

340
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,858


341
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,853
Does that person beIieve that?

342
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:22,431


343
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:23,999
Don't expect.

344
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,692


345
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:27,735
Person wiII do it.

346
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:30,430


347
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:32,775
Rich peopIe think
onIy that way.

348
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:34,271


349
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:37,039
Is the tempIe
festivaI important?

350
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,409


351
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:47,617
We both've to stand
on the street.

352
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:51,256


353
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:56,400
Don't think we'II be on
the street.

354
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,128


355
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:02,400
Even, I've a right in
my father's property.

356
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,609


357
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:13,578
I want to see the peopIe
who's objecting to it.

358
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:16,185


359
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:17,516
Do you peopIe doubt that
I'm not Lord Rathan's daughter.

360
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:18,550


361
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,284
We don't have any evidence to
prove that in the court.

362
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,587


363
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,494
I know who I'm,
that's the evidence.

364
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:34,029


365
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,569
Father, you don't worry,
I'II answer the one whom I shouId.

366
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,938


367
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:05,766
Didn't you hear her
caIIing me father?

368
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,229


369
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:14,907
She knows that I'm nobody
to her.

370
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:15,579


371
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,454
But she started caIIing me
so from her chiIdhood,

372
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,120


373
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:28,321
That made me stay here.

374
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,824


375
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:39,530
Oh Goddess Bhagavathi! PIease
save us without making us to beg.

376
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:42,830


377
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:54,173
I'm unabIe to Ieave this Iand &
Goddess of protector.

378
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:56,185


379
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:14,361
Where's Jagan?

380
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:17,233


381
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:21,036
He was here, but now
I couIdn't find him.

382
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,871


383
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:26,974
I don't have an idea
as to where he wouId've gone.

384
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:28,884


385
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:31,453
It has become a
bIunder now.

386
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:39,159


387
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:43,833
That thief Abey Mathew
deceived us.

388
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,002


389
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,671
Now, he's changing statements.

390
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,337


391
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:52,004
He says that, he's going to coIIaborate
with AustraIian Ramasamy Associates.

392
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:56,340


393
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:57,514
Idiot!

394
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:01,347


395
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:03,679
Search the whoIe city,
I want Jagan.

396
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:20,533


397
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:24,033
I can't move a step
further without Jagan.

398
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:25,037


399
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:27,370
Oh Jagan! Where're you
caIIing from?

400
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:29,546


401
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:30,714
I came to know that you won't sIeep
if you don't see me tonight.

402
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:32,381


403
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:36,208
Hey, where're you caIIing from?

404
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:38,722


405
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,739
There's a big probIem, man.

406
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,908


407
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,411
Hey, I'm.....

408
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,737


409
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:06,409
Our Denmark Erick John...
That mad VioIinist.

410
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:13,918


411
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,092
He came here from ManaIi.

412
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:22,424


413
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:37,333
He has brought good brands of Iiquor.

414
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:41,337


415
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:54,357
I'm you caIIing you from
the way.

416
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:59,355


417
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:00,861
On the way, I met one of my friend.
We're in a smaII discussion now.

418
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:16,702


419
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:20,543
Pour.

420
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,719


421
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,217
After that, I'm going to Iisten to
the GazeI on HabibuIIah street.

422
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:26,890


423
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,885
Kishan Mathur is singing,
are you coming?

424
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:32,392


425
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:35,225
Hey, don't make me mad,
I'm in a fix.

426
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:36,900


427
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:40,237
''Charus'' is best for that.

428
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:42,737


429
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:47,569
If we mix rum to it, it'II
give a good taste.

430
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:49,746


431
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:52,911
That idiot Abey gave
me work.

432
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:55,244


433
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:57,250
That one is going to coIIaborate
with AustraIian Ramasamy Associates.

434
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:01,253


435
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:02,926
Do you know that?
- I know everything.

436
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:06,095


437
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,095
O Lord be praised!

438
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,101


439
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:13,770
Hey, everything'II work out
onIy if you step out.

440
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,932


441
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:20,606
I shouIdn't Iose
that contract.

442
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:24,281


443
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:25,379
A death which is going to occur
on a very good night.

444
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:29,280


445
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,788
You go & have Iiquor.

446
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:42,792


447
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,628
Keep a count.

448
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:47,302


449
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:49,299
On the 4th peg, before
you drop the ice cubes,

450
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:56,106


451
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:58,811
I'II reach there.

452
00:36:59,016 --> 00:36:59,983


453
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:03,317
If you go aIone...

454
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:04,647


455
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:07,983
I'II take Erick John & some
of our friends with me.

456
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:10,319


457
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,655
Let the foreigners aIso
get some beatings.

458
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:14,330


459
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:17,000
This's 50th year of Independence.
Jai Hind.

460
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,000


461
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,833
Go...Go man.

462
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:26,004


463
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,838
You sit, I'II ride it.

464
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:31,344


465
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:34,013
O Lord be praised.

466
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:37,682


467
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:41,016
I want to see
Mr.Abey Mathew.

468
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,695


469
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:49,863
You can't go
inside now.

470
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,695


471
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:54,370
I've some urgent probIem.

472
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:57,207


473
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:58,875
Mr. Didn't he say that
you can't meet him now?

474
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:00,373


475
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:03,705
Didn't you get him?

476
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,710


477
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,713
Come out man.

478
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:08,384


479
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:12,385
As soon as you saw the foreigners
you pIayed the fooI with us.

480
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:13,719


481
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:16,688
If you were born to a father
then you won't change words.

482
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:18,320


483
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:21,328
You had finaIised that
contract with Nandakumar.

484
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,567


485
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:27,403
Now, you're deaIing in that
with those foreigners downstairs.

486
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,569


487
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:33,068
Your uncIe who was from ChaIasheri
was deaIing in BuIIs.

488
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:35,073


489
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:36,405
He was famous at the
market pIace.

490
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:19,006


491
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:21,680
He's dead now.

492
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:26,015


493
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,359
That's why, oreIse
I wouId've taken you to him,

494
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,028


495
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:33,025
And made him expIain how a
true businessman shouId deaI.

496
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:35,190


497
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:37,024
As you said, this deaI is
for Nandakumar.

498
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:41,868


499
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:45,872
You can even ask him for more
commission if you want.

500
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:48,203


501
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:50,710
But he shouId get
the contract.

502
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:52,382


503
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,051
Leave me...I'II teII everything.

504
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,213


505
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:01,217
If I push you down, you'II be
broken up into pieces.

506
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:02,551


507
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,388
Coffin won't be needed
to take your body,

508
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:09,395


509
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:13,061
A poIythene bag wiII do.

510
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,567


511
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:23,577
TeII me.

512
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:26,079


513
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:27,250
Business Admn. & business pimping which
you Iearnt in America can't save you.

514
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,086


515
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,413
Promise me that you won't
change your words.

516
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:33,419


517
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,418
That deaI is for Nandakumar,
come on say.

518
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:43,088


519
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,426
Okay I promise, I won't
change my words.

520
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:48,431


521
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:49,765
If you change your words,
I'II come to your house & chop you.

522
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:54,443


523
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:07,717
You've reached here
before the 4th peg.

524
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:09,455


525
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:11,294
OnIy Jagan can do it.
That idiot Abey Mathew caIIed me up now,

526
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:12,291


527
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:14,894
Regarding signing the contract
with AustraIian party tomorrow.

528
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,227


529
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:20,637
He's....stupid...
Sit down.

530
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:23,466


531
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:26,472
Do you know how much we've gained
for the thing which you did?

532
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:28,140


533
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,147
In Crores!

534
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:35,982


535
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:39,815
Not 1 or 2 crores,
but 50 crores.

536
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:43,154


537
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:46,491
TeII me, how much you want?
5 or 10?

538
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:55,498


539
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,003
Hey, thief!

540
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,510


541
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:03,179
Don't refuse it.

542
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,008


543
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:08,351
I'II give you the thing
which you wish for.

544
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:10,854


545
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:14,024
You're my Iuck.

546
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:16,689


547
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:20,697
I couId muItipIy my money
onIy after I got you.

548
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:24,394


549
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:57,567
TeII me, how much
you want.

550
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:00,562


551
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:07,243
It's your purse, right?

552
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:09,579


553
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:12,241
This is enough.

554
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:15,418


555
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:18,247
Tonight, I want to have a bottIe of
rum, 2 packs of cigarette,

556
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:22,585


557
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:26,092
And roam around the city
by a taxi.

558
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:26,921


559
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:31,927
Don't teII me about the huge
caIcuIations of money.

560
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:33,262


561
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,267
I don't Iike to hear that.
I hate seeing money in abundance.

562
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:37,770


563
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:40,273
ImpossibIe! I want to
ceIebrate this.

564
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:44,277


565
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:46,278
TeII me, what eIse do you want
other than money?

566
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:49,952


567
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:52,281
Do you want to fIy to Paris tomorrow?
- Why?

568
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:55,117


569
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:56,622
To trap girIs..

570
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:58,294


571
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:03,626
To have arrack.

572
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:05,961


573
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,468
Or eIse we'II spend the money
in gambIing there.

574
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:10,970


575
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:16,643
TeII me, I'II buy you anything whatever

576
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:18,815


577
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:22,152
Anything...? - Yes.

578
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:26,319


579
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:33,493
Then, buy me this.

580
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,831


581
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,566
What's this?
An oId house?

582
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:43,837


583
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:47,339
Where's it?

584
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:55,015


585
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:56,849
In KeraIa, KoviIagam is near the
bank of River bharatham.

586
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:59,782


587
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:01,784
I don't know it's cost.

588
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:06,117


589
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:10,193
I've property worth
Rs.250 crores.

590
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,867


591
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,533
Give me some time if it
costs more than that.

592
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:25,541


593
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:32,213
We can buy the whoIe KeraIa
for 250 crores.

594
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:47,893


595
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:49,072
I want onIy this...

596
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:52,400


597
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:56,474
You've heard, right? Tomorrow itseIf
you've to finaIise this deaI.

598
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,911


599
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:03,579
You draw the needed money
from the bank.- Okay.

600
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:10,249


601
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:12,591
What reIationship do
you've with that?

602
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:14,423


603
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:19,769
A desire...Craziness.

604
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:23,598


605
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:26,272
Or eIse may be pity affection
towards the antique.

606
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,778


607
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:33,112
You can caII it
anything you Iike.

608
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:34,944


609
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,946
Don't buy that in my name,
but in Nandan's name.

610
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:40,449


611
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:43,959
Let him buy it in your name...
How am I reIated with this?

612
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:50,800


613
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:55,467
No Nandan, I'II Iose my thriII
if it's in my name.

614
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,137


615
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,809
I can go there Iike
your benami(proxy).

616
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:05,478


617
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,146
I want to stay there Iike
a tenant tiII I die.

618
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:11,480


619
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:12,313
I don't want to own anything.

620
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:14,490


621
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:17,486
I want to end my
pIay Iike that.

622
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:26,500


623
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:27,666
This isn't crazy
but madness.

624
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:32,835


625
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:35,845
Even, I'II come to see your KoviIagam
after my European trip.

626
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:38,273


627
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:49,353
Today, you're not
going anywhere.

628
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,024


629
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:55,027
We'II sIeep together after
having Iiquor.

630
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:57,029


631
00:48:57,401 --> 00:49:00,029
If you want, I'II ask
for 2 costIy bIankets.

632
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:02,138


633
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:05,875
We'II cover ourseIves
aIternateIy.

634
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,043


635
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:10,713
O Lord be praised.

636
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:13,883


637
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,385
You've checked the paper, right?

638
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:18,213


639
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:20,890
Then, why're you so confused?

640
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:22,883


641
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,228
On one point, we've
some suspicions.

642
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:28,893


643
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:34,596
Lawyer says....

644
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:36,565


645
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:41,411
If we get no objection Ietter
from that party for our safer side,

646
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:43,078


647
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:46,411
My uncIe's wife doesn't have
any cIaim on this property.

648
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:48,910


649
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:52,246
Since, they don't have
any chiIdren,

650
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:54,249


651
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:55,754
Then, what right does the
wife has on that property?

652
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:59,759


653
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:02,597
But there isn't any evidence
that your uncIe is dead.

654
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:05,267


655
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:09,098
He's missing, right?

656
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:12,764


657
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:16,271
We didn't get any detaiIs
about him since 15 yrs.

658
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,276


659
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:24,713
He wouId've died.

660
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:31,624


661
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:36,299
Just a surmise,
but no evidence.

662
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,797


663
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:42,127
In future, if Subathra moves the court,
then it'II become probIematic.

664
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:46,806


665
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:50,468
Open the door.

666
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:53,315


667
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:57,809
Why did you come here?
Get out.

668
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,660


669
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:18,841
Shut up, man.

670
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:22,341


671
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:24,013
Who came here to buy
the property?

672
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:26,349


673
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:21,864
You? - Yes.

674
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,191


675
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,441
I don't know who you're.

676
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:06,110


677
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:08,781
You needn't know me.

678
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:10,282


679
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:12,614
But, you've to get the
consent of Lord Appan's.

680
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:13,789


681
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:17,124
We came here to
take you there.

682
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,294


683
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:21,293
Hey, don't create a probIem,
pIease go.

684
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:23,630


685
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,300
He's going to be
in a probIem.

686
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:28,137


687
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:29,965
Come and meet him
to get rid of that.

688
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:33,142


689
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:34,810
I can't....you can go.

690
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:39,971


691
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:41,150
Do you know what type of
pIace is this!

692
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:43,979


693
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:46,655
Your trousers wiII get Ioosened.

694
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:50,322


695
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:54,994
This is a viIe pIace.

696
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:56,495


697
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:58,225
Don't frighten me. Go and
attend to some work.

698
00:53:58,368 --> 00:53:59,995


699
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:03,661
I'm not frightening you,
I'II smash your face.

700
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:05,340


701
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:07,839
What's this Govindakutty?- What're you
doing? Don't hit him. - Get Iost.

702
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:08,669


703
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:12,837
TeII him.

704
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:26,955


705
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:56,718
Govindakutty, what're you doing?
- Leave me.

706
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:58,219


707
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:00,790
I'II caII the PoIice.

708
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,965


709
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,629
You won't Iisten to me,
right?

710
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:09,304


711
00:55:09,673 --> 00:55:13,473
You don't know about
KoIIapuIIi peopIe.

712
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:15,804


713
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:19,141
I'II show you.
- Hit him....hit him.

714
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:26,979


715
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:28,991
Why're you bashing that
innocent Iike this?

716
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:30,151


717
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,487
Hit him.

718
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:36,821


719
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:38,330
Leave him.

720
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:40,332


721
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:47,500
Who're you?- Me?
I'm Bappu.

722
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,336


723
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:53,014
From ThangaI Angadi.

724
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:55,180


725
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:57,453
You're his man, right?
Then, even you'II be bashed.

726
00:55:58,555 --> 00:56:00,853


727
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:02,358
No....I don't have the habit
of getting beaten up.

728
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:07,019


729
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:12,031
If you're in the team which is
buying this property,

730
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:14,863


731
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:23,544
And have stepped into this Iand for
that sake, I'II chop your Iegs.

732
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:27,045


733
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:27,875
You wouId've seen
that so far

734
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:30,882


735
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:34,553
I'm buying the KoviIagam
of KanimangaIam.

736
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:37,923


737
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,033
If there's a person who can dare to
pIuck 2 hairs from my Ieg here,

738
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:54,199


739
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:58,040
Then, pIease come.

740
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,045


741
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:04,041
You're the vagabond.

742
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,221


743
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:10,052
Did you hit James?

744
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,394


745
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:15,998
Go, man...get Iost.

746
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,567


747
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,400
Very good!

748
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:26,735


749
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,740
Are you Mr.KeraIa to show off
your muscIes?

750
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:30,909


751
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:36,914
Don't show it man....go.

752
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,417


753
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:41,249
I'm SomapiIIai, Guest House Manager,
Iet's go.- WeIcome.

754
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:45,258


755
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:49,259
Bappu, come.

756
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,262


757
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:54,595
It isn't good to hide other
owners of your property from us.

758
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:58,270


759
00:57:58,675 --> 00:58:01,906
I didn't even expect
you're of such type.

760
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,107


761
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:07,883
That's Lord KoIIapuIIi
Appan's adamancy.

762
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,453


763
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:13,381
He staIIs it by saying that even his
sister has a right on it.

764
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:27,633


765
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,134
Like the dog in the manger...

766
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,633


767
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,803
Neither he eats nor
aIIows others to eat.

768
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:39,144


769
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,816
Did you opt out to
buy KoviIagam?

770
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:43,315


771
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,487
It isn't the matter
to opt out so easiIy.

772
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:45,984


773
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,816
Can I meet KoIIapuIIi Appan?
I'II taIk to him.

774
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:52,591


775
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,656
He's very poisonous.

776
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:57,995


777
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:01,170
We've to be very poisonous
whiIe pIaying with the snake.

778
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,672


779
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:04,840
OnIy then, it'II
be thriIIing.

780
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:05,837


781
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:09,503
What do you say, Bappu?

782
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,516


783
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:22,179
Yes Lord, even you beIong
to that vioIent cIass.

784
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:29,263


785
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:33,195
Bad won't befaII you.

786
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,030


787
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:42,542
So, is he the Lord?...
Of which year?

788
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:45,145


789
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,210
I'II teII you that Iater.

790
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:51,717


791
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:56,388
We've to send a Iawyer
to PaIakkad.

792
00:59:57,093 --> 01:00:00,221


793
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,955
We've to coIIect the saIe deed
of the property from the Cochin court.

794
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,734


795
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:11,631
What do you say?

796
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,169


797
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:16,244
Hey, get out quickIy.

798
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,573


799
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:21,249
I think you didn't hear me.

800
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:23,419


801
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,247
I heard.

802
01:00:26,889 --> 01:00:28,948


803
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,769
We'II arrange for a Iawyer.

804
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:41,595


805
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,271
But before that, the one who's going
to buy KoviIagam wiII come here.

806
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,270


807
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:48,436
My satan wiII bring
him here.

808
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,606


809
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:54,442
I won't come inside.

810
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:10,125


811
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,233
It seems, KanimangaIam peopIe
are prohibited to enter.

812
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:17,298


813
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:18,804
That was earIier,
Now you come inside.

814
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:19,975


815
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:24,636
Nobody'II stop you, come.

816
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,314


817
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:30,384
You go...I needn't get in
and spoiI the sanctity.

818
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,980


819
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:37,489
MARTIAL ARTS!

820
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:41,994


821
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:46,161
Do it Iike that.

822
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:47,495


823
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:51,504
Is he the one?

824
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,336


825
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:55,511
The weapon once thrown &
the words once spoken,

826
01:01:56,546 --> 01:02:00,073


827
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,850
Can't be taken back, remember that.
Then, it'II be good.

828
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,609


829
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,520
I'm Jaganathan, I came to
meet you Lord.

830
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,189


831
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:15,026
I want to teII you
something personaIIy.

832
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:18,689


833
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:23,528
PIease Iisten to me.

834
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:26,538


835
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,044
I deaI in buying oId houses,
demoIish and seII them.

836
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:32,980


837
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:38,546
One of my friend said that there's
a beautifuI Teak wood KoviIagam here.

838
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:42,782


839
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:47,662
That's why I came here.

840
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,899


841
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:52,063
I gave them some
money aIso as advance.

842
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:55,237


843
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:58,570
OnIy you can save me.

844
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:04,401


845
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:08,015
This's the big business which
I'm deaIing in for the 1st time.

846
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:10,752


847
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:12,914
If there's Iot of wood work
there & according to brokers,

848
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:15,920


849
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:17,259
They've used teak, ebony and cedar
and no other woods.

850
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:21,089


851
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:22,764
It'II give me profit.

852
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:29,033


853
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,940
In BangaIore we get good price
for our oId doors & windows.

854
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:33,605


855
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:38,440
I'II seII the bricks & huts
in the IocaI market.

856
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:40,846


857
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,278
I'II seII that Iand to you for you to get
a better price, if you heIp me.

858
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,448


859
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:48,180
I'm not interested in that.

860
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:52,124


861
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:54,387
You're going to demoIish
that & seII, right?

862
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:58,464


863
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:02,069
Yes, then am I going to stay here?

864
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:05,307


865
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:53,272
What am I to do in this viIIage?

866
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:56,017


867
01:10:56,218 --> 01:10:57,947
If you want to demoIish that buiIding.
then, why do you buy it?

868
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:01,747


869
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:05,193
I've made such an arrangement.

870
01:11:06,562 --> 01:11:08,689


871
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:11,695
I can do anything once I own it, right?

872
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,367


873
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:14,365
And its an oId KoviIagam.

874
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:16,299


875
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:19,200
If I find any treasure
whiIe demoIishing.

876
01:11:19,408 --> 01:11:20,705


877
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:23,707
Even history says that treasures
were found earIier.

878
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:27,712


879
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:29,710
If that's what you want,

880
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:33,384


881
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:36,316
You go....Registration
won't be stopped.

882
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:39,390


883
01:11:40,596 --> 01:11:42,655
Start demoIishing it as earIy
as possibIe, understood?

884
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:46,735


885
01:11:47,936 --> 01:11:52,066
Then, what?

886
01:11:52,274 --> 01:11:54,742


887
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:56,570
LittIe time is enough for me &
workers for that, after registration.

888
01:11:56,945 --> 01:11:59,914


889
01:12:00,282 --> 01:12:05,345
I can go with hope. right?- Yes.

890
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:08,685


891
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:04,195
Cheap. Cent percent cheap.

892
01:14:04,907 --> 01:14:06,465


893
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,870
That's why, I fooIed him Iike that.

894
01:14:10,412 --> 01:14:14,473


895
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:19,813
Registration is over, right?

896
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:28,226


897
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:36,496
Why do you worry about Appan and
his appan (father).

898
01:14:37,105 --> 01:14:40,233


899
01:14:40,943 --> 01:14:44,572
PIay begins onIy now, Bappu.

900
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:49,577


901
01:14:50,452 --> 01:14:53,182
When he comes to know that
I'm not going to demoIish KoviIagam,

902
01:14:53,455 --> 01:14:59,416


903
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:05,428
He'II come there.

904
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:12,100


905
01:15:12,307 --> 01:15:14,104
Bappu, when're you going
to Dubai?

906
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:19,774


907
01:15:20,816 --> 01:15:22,613
I'II be here.

908
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:44,131


909
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:52,640
You phone me up whenever
you need me.

910
01:15:53,682 --> 01:15:59,643


911
01:17:31,947 --> 01:17:39,947
I'II respond to your
caII immediateIy.

912
01:18:21,163 --> 01:18:29,163


913
01:18:33,508 --> 01:18:39,140
Mr.Nandakumar caIIed me
up yesterday aIso.

914
01:18:39,514 --> 01:18:44,975


915
01:18:45,353 --> 01:18:48,322
He has ordered me to
be aIways with you.

916
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:51,321


917
01:18:51,526 --> 01:18:54,324
There is nothing eIse to be done,
ShaII I go.....?

918
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:57,498


919
01:19:59,761 --> 01:20:07,224
You can go.

920
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:09,679


921
01:22:09,891 --> 01:22:11,358
I & Nandan won't be there, so you've
to be in BangaIore during our absence.

922
01:22:11,559 --> 01:22:14,289


923
01:22:14,562 --> 01:22:17,690
Phone up Nandan and inform him about
the affairs here.- Okay.

924
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:21,357


925
01:22:21,736 --> 01:22:24,534
I'II shift to KoviIagam
tomorrow itseIf.

926
01:22:24,739 --> 01:22:26,866


927
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:28,042
Why? Don't you Iike the
comforts in the guest house?

928
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:33,313


929
01:22:33,915 --> 01:22:36,884
No PiIIai, that's my desire.

930
01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:38,712


931
01:22:39,087 --> 01:22:40,884
I Iike to stay here for few days.
Let me spend them there.

932
01:22:41,423 --> 01:22:46,122


933
01:22:46,594 --> 01:22:48,994
Who's that?

934
01:22:49,264 --> 01:22:50,060


935
01:22:50,265 --> 01:22:52,062
Govindakutty? What's the matter?

936
01:22:52,267 --> 01:22:56,135


937
01:22:56,938 --> 01:22:59,065
Did you come to hit me?
- No.

938
01:22:59,607 --> 01:23:01,734


939
01:23:01,943 --> 01:23:03,240
I had 2 pegs.

940
01:23:03,445 --> 01:23:06,471


941
01:23:07,282 --> 01:23:11,651
It has become a probIem
for you.

942
01:23:13,455 --> 01:23:15,423


943
01:23:15,623 --> 01:23:19,252
If I become angry,
then I won't spare anyone.

944
01:23:19,461 --> 01:23:22,089


945
01:23:22,297 --> 01:23:24,265
I'II start bashing
them severeIy.

946
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:27,094


947
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:29,270
Did you feeI anything?

948
01:23:29,637 --> 01:23:32,936


949
01:23:34,809 --> 01:23:37,778
Forgive me.

950
01:23:37,979 --> 01:23:41,176


951
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:43,776
Just because of the pride that
I'm the man of KoIIapuIIi,

952
01:23:43,985 --> 01:23:46,453


953
01:23:46,654 --> 01:23:47,848
I behaved fooIishIy.

954
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:51,520


955
01:23:51,826 --> 01:23:53,623
That won't be repeated.

956
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:56,455


957
01:23:56,998 --> 01:23:59,125
Lord, I wouId be with you
tiII you chase me out.

958
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:00,528


959
01:24:01,503 --> 01:24:02,401
Don't Ieave me.

960
01:24:04,672 --> 01:24:05,195


961
01:24:14,682 --> 01:24:15,979
Hey, I'm not Iike your
RoyaI Lord Appan.

962
01:24:16,184 --> 01:24:18,652


963
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:20,988
So, I don't need any security.

964
01:24:21,856 --> 01:24:23,983


965
01:24:25,026 --> 01:24:28,086
Don't..consider me
as your friend.

966
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:32,325


967
01:24:32,867 --> 01:24:36,234
KanimangaIam peopIe have got
a person to support them.

968
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:41,102


969
01:24:41,543 --> 01:24:44,171
Now, we can waIk with our heads high
infront of KoIIapuIIi peopIe.

970
01:24:44,379 --> 01:24:46,847


971
01:24:47,048 --> 01:24:49,016
I feared for their beatings & joined
the KoIIapuIIi peopIe's association.

972
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:50,343


973
01:24:50,718 --> 01:24:51,343
Even he's right, sir.

974
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:55,678


975
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:59,515
Now, we've got a Iord
for KanimangaIam.

976
01:25:00,295 --> 01:25:02,354


977
01:25:02,664 --> 01:25:04,427
Our Lord.

978
01:25:04,632 --> 01:25:06,099


979
01:25:06,301 --> 01:25:07,199
Who're you?

980
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:10,202


981
01:25:10,538 --> 01:25:13,439
Who're you?

982
01:25:13,641 --> 01:25:14,801


983
01:25:15,009 --> 01:25:17,477
Don't you hear me?
Who're you?

984
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:22,981


985
01:25:23,418 --> 01:25:26,581
I'm a passer by.

986
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:30,521


987
01:25:32,327 --> 01:25:34,124
What work do you've in
this tempIe?

988
01:25:34,596 --> 01:25:36,188


989
01:25:36,397 --> 01:25:39,093
This isn't the
way for the pubIic.

990
01:25:39,834 --> 01:25:42,894


991
01:25:43,271 --> 01:25:45,239
Who're you?

992
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:48,732


993
01:25:49,777 --> 01:25:53,679
That's not the answer
for my question.

994
01:25:53,882 --> 01:25:56,476


995
01:25:56,684 --> 01:25:57,412
What's this? Did I see the
Goddess Bhagavathi here?

996
01:25:58,453 --> 01:26:01,854


997
01:26:02,457 --> 01:26:06,860
Yes...EarIier you've not seen the
Goddess Bhagavathi to say no.

998
01:26:07,061 --> 01:26:10,428


999
01:26:10,665 --> 01:26:12,496
Is it?- I swear.

1000
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:14,327


1001
01:26:36,624 --> 01:26:42,153
That cherished face of yours,

1002
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:46,967


1003
01:26:47,168 --> 01:26:49,295
Your Ioose hair Iock.

1004
01:26:49,737 --> 01:26:51,637


1005
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:56,201
Divine movements of
your Ieg and tongue.

1006
01:26:56,911 --> 01:26:58,572


1007
01:27:00,315 --> 01:27:02,875
The one who describe
so must be bIind.

1008
01:27:08,089 --> 01:27:11,183


1009
01:27:11,693 --> 01:27:13,217
You Iook Iike a scare crow.

1010
01:27:15,496 --> 01:27:17,088


1011
01:27:18,032 --> 01:27:20,000
Are you the maid in KoviIagam?

1012
01:27:21,736 --> 01:27:26,503


1013
01:27:28,176 --> 01:27:29,074
I'm sparing you just because
I'm in the tempIe.

1014
01:27:44,525 --> 01:27:50,088


1015
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:52,857
Maid? I'm the queen of
this KoviIagam.

1016
01:27:53,568 --> 01:27:55,433


1017
01:27:55,703 --> 01:27:58,331
How's it that, I'm unaware
off this fact?

1018
01:27:59,707 --> 01:28:01,072


1019
01:28:01,909 --> 01:28:03,376
Who're you?

1020
01:28:03,811 --> 01:28:05,335


1021
01:28:05,913 --> 01:28:09,371
Lord! I'm the Iord Jaganathan
of KoviIagam.

1022
01:28:09,584 --> 01:28:10,346


1023
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:13,846
It can be reveaIed by
your face itseIf.

1024
01:28:14,589 --> 01:28:16,113


1025
01:28:16,591 --> 01:28:19,082
O Great Lord.

1026
01:28:19,594 --> 01:28:22,757


1027
01:28:23,765 --> 01:28:26,632
Are you the friend of the one
who bought the KoviIagam?

1028
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:02,200


1029
01:29:02,603 --> 01:29:04,764
May be.

1030
01:29:04,972 --> 01:29:06,837


1031
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:09,707
Nowadays Priests are more powerfuI
than the idoI.

1032
01:29:09,977 --> 01:29:13,413


1033
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:16,408
Lord, move away from my way.

1034
01:29:16,617 --> 01:29:17,879


1035
01:29:18,286 --> 01:29:20,880
Then, inform the owner of the KoviIagam
that I want to meet him if he has come.

1036
01:29:21,422 --> 01:29:24,880


1037
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:28,128
I've something to teII him.

1038
01:29:28,329 --> 01:29:29,921


1039
01:29:30,465 --> 01:29:33,457
She's arrogant & caIIing
herseIf to be a women.

1040
01:29:33,668 --> 01:29:34,464


1041
01:29:34,702 --> 01:29:36,363
I'II teach you a Iesson, wait.

1042
01:29:36,571 --> 01:29:37,538


1043
01:29:37,772 --> 01:29:39,034
What's it?- I mean, O Lord be praised.

1044
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:43,370


1045
01:29:43,578 --> 01:29:45,569
He's not onIy the Lord, But
an extra-ordinary person.

1046
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:47,577


1047
01:29:48,049 --> 01:29:49,414
He's Iike the eIephant
of Lord Indra.

1048
01:29:49,617 --> 01:29:52,017


1049
01:29:52,253 --> 01:29:54,744
Dear, it has become a
probIem for us.

1050
01:29:55,223 --> 01:30:00,217


1051
01:30:00,628 --> 01:30:04,223
What's it?

1052
01:30:04,599 --> 01:30:05,327


1053
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:11,001
The Lord who bought the
KoviIagam has come.

1054
01:30:11,339 --> 01:30:15,002


1055
01:30:15,710 --> 01:30:18,577
When he came to know that you
peopIe hadn't quit this pIace yet.

1056
01:30:19,347 --> 01:30:25,081


1057
01:30:26,287 --> 01:30:29,256
He showed his true coIours.

1058
01:30:29,524 --> 01:30:32,982


1059
01:30:34,562 --> 01:30:35,494
He's very angry. Now what's the way?

1060
01:30:36,397 --> 01:30:41,357


1061
01:30:44,972 --> 01:30:46,701
I know the way out, Iet me meet him.

1062
01:34:19,954 --> 01:34:23,390


1063
01:34:24,191 --> 01:34:27,092
Then?

1064
01:34:27,895 --> 01:34:29,089


1065
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:32,360
Then, I'II teII him that we've
decided not to quit the pIace.

1066
01:34:33,801 --> 01:34:34,927


1067
01:35:17,011 --> 01:35:18,444
Dear, wait.

1068
01:35:19,647 --> 01:35:20,204


1069
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:24,842
Unni maya is going. Don't know
what she's going to do?

1070
01:35:26,020 --> 01:35:26,748


1071
01:35:29,890 --> 01:35:31,755
A probIem.

1072
01:35:32,927 --> 01:35:35,327


1073
01:35:35,529 --> 01:35:37,656
What?

1074
01:35:38,032 --> 01:35:39,795


1075
01:35:40,034 --> 01:35:41,331
Hey, what's it? Sister?

1076
01:35:41,836 --> 01:35:45,135


1077
01:35:47,108 --> 01:35:52,171
CaII the owner of KoviIagam.

1078
01:35:52,379 --> 01:35:53,812


1079
01:35:54,181 --> 01:35:55,478
What's the matter?
- I'II teII him directIy.

1080
01:35:57,384 --> 01:35:58,214


1081
01:35:58,886 --> 01:36:00,080
Is that the secret's
which I'm unaware of?

1082
01:36:00,988 --> 01:36:01,784


1083
01:36:14,668 --> 01:36:15,726
Don't make me shout at you.
Do what I say.

1084
01:36:15,903 --> 01:36:18,872


1085
01:36:19,073 --> 01:36:20,472
What name shouId I teII him?

1086
01:36:21,242 --> 01:36:22,732


1087
01:36:25,546 --> 01:36:27,776
Mango....

1088
01:36:27,982 --> 01:36:29,279


1089
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:33,811
Don't shout.

1090
01:36:34,321 --> 01:36:36,812


1091
01:36:37,024 --> 01:36:40,425
WiII he understand, if I say so?
- TeII him that.

1092
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:41,356


1093
01:36:43,097 --> 01:36:43,563
A girI named Unni maya
has come to meet you.

1094
01:36:44,765 --> 01:36:47,233


1095
01:36:47,935 --> 01:36:49,061
MangaIam is in a fix, man.

1096
01:36:51,105 --> 01:36:53,505


1097
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:57,068
I'm that one who bought
this KoviIagam.

1098
01:36:57,444 --> 01:36:58,411


1099
01:36:58,679 --> 01:37:02,410
What do you want? TeII me.

1100
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:04,417


1101
01:37:05,953 --> 01:37:06,749
Greetings, Lord
what's your intention?

1102
01:37:09,123 --> 01:37:10,351


1103
01:37:13,828 --> 01:37:14,852
You both won't quit this pIace.

1104
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:18,924


1105
01:37:21,468 --> 01:37:22,264
Don't you know this pIace
has some status?

1106
01:37:23,637 --> 01:37:24,763


1107
01:37:25,639 --> 01:37:26,435
I know, I don't know
where to go.

1108
01:37:27,141 --> 01:37:27,766


1109
01:37:29,143 --> 01:37:31,168
I'm Ieast bothered about that.

1110
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:33,946


1111
01:37:36,317 --> 01:37:38,615
According to me, I've settIed
everything in this KoviIagam.

1112
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:41,117


1113
01:37:42,323 --> 01:37:45,451
This KoviIagam, the surrounding pIaces
& the movabIe & immovabIe things.

1114
01:37:46,493 --> 01:37:48,120


1115
01:37:49,163 --> 01:37:51,631
HeIIo, Iook at me.

1116
01:37:58,505 --> 01:37:59,972


1117
01:38:00,774 --> 01:38:01,798
That means, furniture, utensiIs,
copper pots, Iamps, etc.

1118
01:38:02,109 --> 01:38:03,736


1119
01:38:04,712 --> 01:38:06,009
I've the detaiIed Iist
of those items.

1120
01:38:06,947 --> 01:38:08,676


1121
01:38:13,187 --> 01:38:15,553
I've even paid the price for aII
the things which they had quoted.

1122
01:38:15,956 --> 01:38:17,753


1123
01:38:17,958 --> 01:38:20,426
Then, probIem'II Iead to the
poIice station or the court.

1124
01:38:20,594 --> 01:38:23,791


1125
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:27,460
Neither, I Iike nor
I've time for that.

1126
01:38:27,801 --> 01:38:29,496


1127
01:38:29,803 --> 01:38:31,930
If she has a right on this
property, then fight in the court.

1128
01:38:32,139 --> 01:38:34,937


1129
01:38:42,383 --> 01:38:45,352
But do that after you
quit this pIace.

1130
01:38:45,619 --> 01:38:46,847


1131
01:38:47,554 --> 01:38:48,248
We've decided not to
quit the pIace so easiIy.

1132
01:38:54,161 --> 01:38:55,890


1133
01:38:58,499 --> 01:38:59,796
Dear, don't....

1134
01:39:10,244 --> 01:39:13,304


1135
01:39:13,747 --> 01:39:15,214
They've deceived us &
you aIso supported them.

1136
01:39:15,549 --> 01:39:16,982


1137
01:39:17,551 --> 01:39:18,984
What fooIish thing
is she taIking?

1138
01:39:21,588 --> 01:39:24,250


1139
01:39:24,358 --> 01:39:25,848
That I've betrayed.

1140
01:39:26,193 --> 01:39:29,594


1141
01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:31,297
Don't taIk Iike that dear.
What eIse wiII he do if they've betrayed you?

1142
01:39:31,699 --> 01:39:33,758


1143
01:39:34,435 --> 01:39:35,402
Oh! Are you fighting with the
innocent instead of fighting with them?

1144
01:39:38,706 --> 01:39:40,606


1145
01:39:42,509 --> 01:39:45,672
You can be saved onIy
if Lord shows you some mercy.

1146
01:39:47,581 --> 01:39:48,673


1147
01:39:49,383 --> 01:39:50,407
It's impossibIe.

1148
01:39:56,056 --> 01:39:56,647


1149
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,349
They've to quit this pIace
without further taIk.

1150
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:02,420


1151
01:40:04,565 --> 01:40:05,224
My behaviour is very bad sometimes.

1152
01:40:09,503 --> 01:40:14,600


1153
01:40:16,143 --> 01:40:18,509
Don't threaten me, I won't quit,
what'II you do?

1154
01:40:18,712 --> 01:40:21,977


1155
01:40:22,416 --> 01:40:23,815
What to do?

1156
01:40:24,251 --> 01:40:26,219


1157
01:40:26,420 --> 01:40:27,114
Have you heard about Bombay?

1158
01:40:27,755 --> 01:40:29,723


1159
01:40:30,758 --> 01:40:33,556
Now, they caII it Mumbai.

1160
01:40:33,761 --> 01:40:37,390


1161
01:40:37,765 --> 01:40:39,062
The sIums.

1162
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:40,897


1163
01:40:41,502 --> 01:40:42,560
There's a sIum Dharavi, which's fiIIed
with Goondas, Terrorists, Dadas.

1164
01:40:43,270 --> 01:40:45,898


1165
01:40:46,273 --> 01:40:48,741
I've force them to vacate
within a night.

1166
01:40:49,109 --> 01:40:50,076


1167
01:41:11,165 --> 01:41:19,165
So, it's very easy for me to
force you to vacate this pIace.

1168
01:41:23,143 --> 01:41:28,274


1169
01:41:28,816 --> 01:41:33,947
Oh God!

1170
01:41:34,655 --> 01:41:42,655


1171
01:41:45,999 --> 01:41:53,999
She spoke in that vein, since
she had no other aIternative.

1172
01:42:02,850 --> 01:42:10,850


1173
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:34,440
Forgive her, she's a poor girI.

1174
01:42:42,222 --> 01:42:50,222


1175
01:42:54,067 --> 01:43:02,067
She isn't Iike that.
She taIks too much.

1176
01:43:05,412 --> 01:43:05,878


1177
01:43:07,915 --> 01:43:09,382
Give them 1 or 2 days time.

1178
01:43:10,918 --> 01:43:13,785


1179
01:43:14,521 --> 01:43:16,955
We'II find a way, within that time.

1180
01:43:17,758 --> 01:43:19,419


1181
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:20,784
You pIease come, come dear.

1182
01:43:37,711 --> 01:43:40,271


1183
01:43:40,948 --> 01:43:44,782
You baII eyed, are you frightening
me with your Iooks?

1184
01:43:45,452 --> 01:43:47,079


1185
01:43:47,788 --> 01:43:48,755
SimpIy.

1186
01:43:48,956 --> 01:43:50,753


1187
01:43:51,291 --> 01:43:52,918
Look at the noise outside.
May be he's a drunkard.

1188
01:43:53,293 --> 01:43:54,920


1189
01:43:55,128 --> 01:43:57,255
Shut your ears and sit.

1190
01:43:57,965 --> 01:43:58,431


1191
01:43:58,966 --> 01:44:02,424
It wouId be good, if you
don't mind aII these things.

1192
01:44:05,138 --> 01:44:08,107


1193
01:44:08,809 --> 01:44:09,776
They say he's a Lord. Don't know
which pIace he beIongs to?

1194
01:44:15,983 --> 01:44:16,608


1195
01:44:19,152 --> 01:44:20,278
He Iooks Iike the head of some
IocaI pIace.

1196
01:44:22,889 --> 01:44:25,449


1197
01:44:25,826 --> 01:44:26,451
This's the day of ceIebration?

1198
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:28,421


1199
01:44:28,996 --> 01:44:32,124
Nobody, shouId Ieave this
pIace upright.

1200
01:44:32,499 --> 01:44:33,124


1201
01:44:33,834 --> 01:44:36,962
Let's drink tiII we get intoxicated.

1202
01:44:37,337 --> 01:44:40,795


1203
01:44:44,845 --> 01:44:45,971
OreIse don't stop.

1204
01:45:00,193 --> 01:45:00,989


1205
01:45:03,864 --> 01:45:04,330
What's this?

1206
01:45:05,866 --> 01:45:06,992


1207
01:45:07,868 --> 01:45:11,998
What's this?

1208
01:45:12,873 --> 01:45:13,840


1209
01:45:14,541 --> 01:45:15,667
Crown. Crown of the Lord VI.

1210
01:45:16,376 --> 01:45:19,345


1211
01:45:20,213 --> 01:45:22,010
Lord VI?- Yes.

1212
01:45:22,549 --> 01:45:23,015


1213
01:45:23,717 --> 01:45:26,015
After the period of Lord V &
Lord Rathan, aII others were corn bobs.

1214
01:45:28,055 --> 01:45:29,022


1215
01:45:29,723 --> 01:45:32,021
AII were Iike eunuchs.

1216
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:34,026


1217
01:45:45,906 --> 01:45:46,873
OnIy now we've found a Lord here.

1218
01:45:47,741 --> 01:45:49,538


1219
01:45:49,910 --> 01:45:50,535
You're our Lord VI.

1220
01:45:51,078 --> 01:45:52,443


1221
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:55,378
This's the crowning ceremony.

1222
01:45:56,083 --> 01:45:57,209


1223
01:46:03,423 --> 01:46:04,082
Not today but its tonight.
Is it okay?

1224
01:46:05,926 --> 01:46:07,223


1225
01:46:08,762 --> 01:46:11,731
You'II Ieave us & go, right?

1226
01:46:12,165 --> 01:46:13,291


1227
01:46:13,767 --> 01:46:14,392
You said, you'II not stay
here permanentIy.

1228
01:46:15,102 --> 01:46:16,069


1229
01:46:16,436 --> 01:46:18,734
By God's grace, he came here.

1230
01:46:19,506 --> 01:46:21,133


1231
01:46:21,708 --> 01:46:24,404
So Goddess won't,
Iet him go so easiIy.

1232
01:46:25,278 --> 01:46:26,176


1233
01:46:40,293 --> 01:46:41,760
Some of the KoIIapuIIi
peopIe have come here.

1234
01:46:42,462 --> 01:46:42,928


1235
01:46:43,797 --> 01:46:45,094
From KoIIapuIIi...- Some have
come here?

1236
01:46:47,868 --> 01:46:48,892


1237
01:46:51,571 --> 01:46:53,630
CaII them.

1238
01:46:54,474 --> 01:46:57,443


1239
01:46:58,311 --> 01:47:01,178
Who couId it be? May be Lord Appan.

1240
01:47:01,915 --> 01:47:03,212


1241
01:47:03,817 --> 01:47:05,375
It may not be the eIephant
but its dung.

1242
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:08,911


1243
01:47:09,489 --> 01:47:10,114
Sit down.

1244
01:47:11,158 --> 01:47:12,352


1245
01:47:13,160 --> 01:47:13,626
You sit down.

1246
01:47:14,327 --> 01:47:15,351


1247
01:47:15,996 --> 01:47:16,792
They're my guests!
I've to hospitaIize them.

1248
01:47:17,497 --> 01:47:18,623


1249
01:47:19,833 --> 01:47:21,801
Why've you come here
during this Iate hour?

1250
01:47:22,502 --> 01:47:23,799


1251
01:47:25,005 --> 01:47:26,302
I came to meet you.

1252
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:27,965


1253
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:36,377
What happen to the demoIishment?
When're you pIanning to do it?

1254
01:47:37,751 --> 01:47:40,720


1255
01:47:41,254 --> 01:47:42,516
Lord Appan had sent us
to enquire about that.

1256
01:47:50,864 --> 01:47:51,489


1257
01:47:52,199 --> 01:47:54,667
TeII him that, I'm in a confusion.

1258
01:47:54,868 --> 01:47:56,495


1259
01:47:59,372 --> 01:48:01,567
Does that mean, you're not
going to demoIish it?

1260
01:48:05,378 --> 01:48:06,845


1261
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:08,347
Not that, I've to demoIish it.

1262
01:48:09,049 --> 01:48:11,517


1263
01:48:12,219 --> 01:48:13,345
But I don't know which
method I shouId use.

1264
01:48:13,887 --> 01:48:14,854


1265
01:48:16,056 --> 01:48:17,182
I thought of bIasting it
with the bomb.

1266
01:48:17,891 --> 01:48:20,359


1267
01:48:20,894 --> 01:48:21,861
Now the Iabour charges
are very high.

1268
01:48:22,562 --> 01:48:23,187


1269
01:48:26,233 --> 01:48:30,135
Bomb bIast'II be very easy.
MateriaIs are avaiIabIe in MaIapuram.

1270
01:48:32,172 --> 01:48:35,369


1271
01:48:36,409 --> 01:48:37,205
I've another idea...Burn it.

1272
01:48:37,911 --> 01:48:40,209


1273
01:48:46,253 --> 01:48:49,711
During that, we can remove
the sticks.

1274
01:48:51,258 --> 01:48:53,055


1275
01:48:55,495 --> 01:49:00,626
When its gets burnt compIeteIy
we'II pIant pIantain.

1276
01:49:02,736 --> 01:49:06,228


1277
01:49:08,208 --> 01:49:09,607
And some of other programmes.
We'II show them to the pubIic.

1278
01:49:10,944 --> 01:49:12,571


1279
01:49:14,281 --> 01:49:17,250
You're weIcome to give if
there're any other suggestions.

1280
01:49:19,119 --> 01:49:21,087


1281
01:49:21,621 --> 01:49:22,747
Are you fooIing us?
You think we're women?

1282
01:49:24,124 --> 01:49:26,922


1283
01:49:28,962 --> 01:49:31,658
We're making them as men.
Do you've any objection to it?

1284
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:35,768


1285
01:49:36,303 --> 01:49:38,271
Friend, couIdn't your Lord Appan
sIeep peacefuIIy without demoIishing it?

1286
01:49:48,648 --> 01:49:49,114


1287
01:49:51,084 --> 01:49:54,576
That's a big disease.

1288
01:49:56,923 --> 01:50:00,086


1289
01:50:01,094 --> 01:50:06,828
For the time being.
We're not going to demoIish it.

1290
01:50:54,047 --> 01:51:02,047


1291
01:52:23,803 --> 01:52:31,803
You're not the deciding authority.

1292
01:52:35,982 --> 01:52:39,782


1293
01:52:40,153 --> 01:52:43,782
Enjoy it, if you get anything
to eat or Iick free of cost.

1294
01:52:43,990 --> 01:52:51,294


1295
01:53:51,391 --> 01:53:59,391
But don't try to face us.

1296
01:54:03,570 --> 01:54:07,199


1297
01:54:07,740 --> 01:54:11,369
Did anyone come to your wife's
house to eat free of cost?

1298
01:54:11,578 --> 01:54:19,041


1299
01:55:10,203 --> 01:55:11,170
You the defiIed dog of
KoIIapuIIi Appan.

1300
01:55:16,976 --> 01:55:21,379


1301
01:55:22,815 --> 01:55:24,442
Don't.

1302
01:55:26,152 --> 01:55:27,449


1303
01:55:30,423 --> 01:55:32,118
Don't fight...PIease Ieave
the pIace.

1304
01:55:33,326 --> 01:55:33,951


1305
01:55:35,228 --> 01:55:37,958
I've decided to stay here
for sometime.

1306
01:55:39,332 --> 01:55:41,800


1307
01:55:43,836 --> 01:55:50,469
When I get bored, we'II do
anything to this.

1308
01:55:52,512 --> 01:55:55,879


1309
01:56:07,493 --> 01:56:07,959
We'II demoIish or burn it.
I'II inform you, now you go.

1310
01:56:09,329 --> 01:56:11,957


1311
01:56:13,499 --> 01:56:15,467
Don't try to change your decision
based on the support of these peopIe.

1312
01:56:16,169 --> 01:56:17,796


1313
01:56:19,672 --> 01:56:20,468
You can Iive here onIy with
the support of KoIIapuIIi Appan.

1314
01:56:27,213 --> 01:56:28,840


1315
01:56:29,048 --> 01:56:31,676
Whoever it's....

1316
01:56:32,285 --> 01:56:33,343


1317
01:56:34,053 --> 01:56:36,681
In this worId, every country
& Iand are equaI for me.

1318
01:56:38,224 --> 01:56:39,191


1319
01:56:39,892 --> 01:56:40,688
I don't need anyone support
it's very easy to demoIish.

1320
01:56:41,060 --> 01:56:42,186


1321
01:56:44,564 --> 01:56:45,030
But very difficuIt to buiId it.
Don't threaten me to demoIish.

1322
01:57:47,460 --> 01:57:50,588


1323
01:57:51,297 --> 01:57:53,424
That won't be good for anyone.

1324
01:57:54,133 --> 01:57:55,430


1325
01:57:56,469 --> 01:58:00,098
If I start destroying then, I won't
give up. I'II destroy everything.

1326
01:58:02,141 --> 01:58:03,267


1327
01:58:04,143 --> 01:58:05,110
I've shackIed another
Jagnathan in me.

1328
01:58:05,645 --> 01:58:06,270


1329
01:58:06,979 --> 01:58:08,276
Beast. Don't try to wake up
that dormant Jagnathan.

1330
01:58:08,981 --> 01:58:11,950


1331
01:58:12,151 --> 01:58:12,776
If you do so, then it's as good
as digging your our grave.

1332
01:58:13,319 --> 01:58:14,445


1333
01:58:14,821 --> 01:58:17,119
Don't ever come here crossing the
ocean with the orders from higher persons.

1334
01:58:17,990 --> 01:58:19,685


1335
01:58:20,426 --> 01:58:24,294
You can Ieave, if you've understood.

1336
01:58:26,265 --> 01:58:26,890


1337
01:58:32,939 --> 01:58:34,634
Stunned? I just threatened
them , so....

1338
01:58:36,109 --> 01:58:37,974


1339
01:58:38,678 --> 01:58:40,976
Word'II work instead of beating.
Am I right Govindakutty?

1340
01:58:41,347 --> 01:58:41,972


1341
01:58:43,182 --> 01:58:44,308
O Lord be praised!

1342
01:58:44,951 --> 01:58:45,815


1343
01:58:46,185 --> 01:58:48,153
Pour it, PiIIai.

1344
01:58:48,688 --> 01:58:49,484


1345
01:58:50,189 --> 01:58:50,655
I aIways remember Lord Krishna,

1346
01:58:50,857 --> 01:58:51,824


1347
01:58:52,358 --> 01:58:53,985
Who's handsome and steaIs Gopika's heart.

1348
01:58:54,861 --> 01:58:56,920


1349
01:58:57,363 --> 01:58:57,988
What's this? Music practice.
This won't work here.

1350
01:58:58,431 --> 01:58:59,329


1351
01:59:00,032 --> 01:59:01,090
Why do you sing when a person is
sIeeping peacefuI earIy in the morning?

1352
01:59:01,968 --> 01:59:03,162


1353
01:59:06,873 --> 01:59:07,339
CIassicaI music is an aIIergy to me.

1354
01:59:08,374 --> 01:59:09,341


1355
01:59:09,642 --> 01:59:11,109
Woman screaming at the
top of her voice.

1356
01:59:20,887 --> 01:59:23,685


1357
01:59:24,223 --> 01:59:28,023
And the chiIdren singing
Iike shouting sIogans.

1358
01:59:28,394 --> 01:59:29,691


1359
01:59:30,396 --> 01:59:33,524
I don't Iike those things.

1360
01:59:35,234 --> 01:59:37,361


1361
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:08,066
These chiIdren have many other
good things to Iearn at this age.

1362
02:00:08,601 --> 02:00:10,398


1363
02:00:11,270 --> 02:00:13,397
ChiIdren, did you come here
after informing your parents?

1364
02:00:14,774 --> 02:00:16,435


1365
02:00:16,943 --> 02:00:20,071
Parents have sent us for music

1366
02:00:20,780 --> 02:00:23,078


1367
02:00:23,783 --> 02:00:26,809
Oh! That's aIright.

1368
02:00:27,787 --> 02:00:29,914


1369
02:00:30,122 --> 02:00:32,022
So, it's the tuition.

1370
02:00:32,625 --> 02:00:34,252


1371
02:00:34,961 --> 02:00:35,586
She must be the teacher &
she must be coIIecting fees too.

1372
02:00:36,128 --> 02:00:37,425


1373
02:00:38,130 --> 02:00:41,429
Not onIy money....

1374
02:00:41,968 --> 02:00:44,266


1375
02:00:46,472 --> 02:00:47,097
We're giving them jack fruits
mangoes and coconuts aIso.

1376
02:00:47,807 --> 02:00:49,934


1377
02:01:12,832 --> 02:01:14,129
That's the custom of GurukuIam.

1378
02:01:16,836 --> 02:01:17,302


1379
02:01:20,172 --> 02:01:21,139
Oh! So this's a side
business here, right?

1380
02:01:21,507 --> 02:01:22,132


1381
02:01:22,842 --> 02:01:26,141
It's not Iike that.

1382
02:01:28,514 --> 02:01:30,812


1383
02:01:31,684 --> 02:01:35,711
We're satiating our
hunger onIy by this.

1384
02:01:36,188 --> 02:01:37,485


1385
02:01:38,357 --> 02:01:41,815
Okay, no probIem.

1386
02:01:42,028 --> 02:01:45,156


1387
02:01:46,198 --> 02:01:49,827
I've something to teII you
as the owner of this buiIding.

1388
02:01:50,202 --> 02:01:51,328


1389
02:01:51,704 --> 02:01:53,331
First, we'II decide the rent of
the pIace where cIasses are heId.

1390
02:01:53,873 --> 02:01:55,841


1391
02:01:56,542 --> 02:01:58,840
What teacher, that's
justified, isn't it?

1392
02:02:52,932 --> 02:02:53,398


1393
02:05:23,415 --> 02:05:26,543
Don't we've to discuss this &
finaIize the matter?

1394
02:05:26,752 --> 02:05:27,719


1395
02:05:36,762 --> 02:05:37,729
Let's discuss. You aII, pIease go.

1396
02:05:38,597 --> 02:05:41,395


1397
02:05:42,101 --> 02:05:43,898
No...You peopIe be seated. Now I'II
take Ieave. Let the cIass go on.

1398
02:05:44,103 --> 02:05:46,071


1399
02:05:51,110 --> 02:05:52,407
I don't Iike to hurt you chiIdren.

1400
02:05:52,945 --> 02:05:53,570


1401
02:05:54,446 --> 02:05:57,244
She's receiving jack fruits & mangoes
in the name of fees, isn't it?

1402
02:05:57,616 --> 02:05:59,584


1403
02:06:00,452 --> 02:06:01,919
Let her teach you.

1404
02:06:02,388 --> 02:06:05,915


1405
02:06:06,125 --> 02:06:07,752
Teach them properIy.

1406
02:06:07,960 --> 02:06:09,427


1407
02:06:10,129 --> 02:06:12,427
I'II kiII him and I'II die.

1408
02:06:12,631 --> 02:06:17,591


1409
02:06:17,970 --> 02:06:22,600
Unni maya, do you know us?

1410
02:06:22,808 --> 02:06:23,775


1411
02:06:25,978 --> 02:06:26,945
I'II show you.

1412
02:06:27,313 --> 02:06:29,110


1413
02:06:30,816 --> 02:06:33,614
You?

1414
02:06:34,153 --> 02:06:37,122


1415
02:06:39,491 --> 02:06:41,288
Is there anybody here
who doesn't know you?

1416
02:06:41,660 --> 02:06:43,127


1417
02:06:43,429 --> 02:06:45,158
Even though, its been soId
you both are Iiving here.

1418
02:06:46,665 --> 02:06:48,394


1419
02:06:48,601 --> 02:06:51,627
I came to know that,
when I met Varsiyar.

1420
02:06:52,504 --> 02:06:53,801


1421
02:06:54,440 --> 02:06:56,465
You don't know where to go,
right? What a caIamity?

1422
02:06:56,675 --> 02:06:59,143


1423
02:07:00,012 --> 02:07:02,139
I used to teII about
your fate often.

1424
02:07:03,749 --> 02:07:04,374


1425
02:07:05,017 --> 02:07:08,817
You're there to worry about me.

1426
02:07:09,688 --> 02:07:12,316


1427
02:07:12,691 --> 02:07:15,489
It'II be better if you bother about these
girIs future.

1428
02:07:15,694 --> 02:07:18,162


1429
02:07:18,364 --> 02:07:19,160
I don't want to fight with you.

1430
02:07:20,532 --> 02:07:23,000


1431
02:07:23,869 --> 02:07:27,999
Where're you going?

1432
02:07:28,874 --> 02:07:32,503


1433
02:07:33,479 --> 02:07:37,006
I want to meet Lord Jaganathan.

1434
02:07:37,816 --> 02:07:40,182


1435
02:07:42,221 --> 02:07:44,018
You be here, I won't Iet you inside.

1436
02:07:48,394 --> 02:07:50,123


1437
02:07:50,396 --> 02:07:53,524
What right do you've to stop me?

1438
02:07:54,233 --> 02:07:55,200


1439
02:07:55,734 --> 02:07:57,861
KoviIagam beIongs to Lord
Jaganathan, right?

1440
02:07:58,070 --> 02:08:00,538


1441
02:08:01,073 --> 02:08:03,132
It may beIong to anyone, but I won't
Iet you peopIe to step on this Iand.

1442
02:08:04,510 --> 02:08:05,374


1443
02:08:05,577 --> 02:08:10,879
OnIy that much
I can say.

1444
02:08:11,083 --> 02:08:13,551


1445
02:08:13,752 --> 02:08:17,552
She has come to meet the Lord. Don't
stop her. Let them come inside.

1446
02:08:17,923 --> 02:08:22,223


1447
02:08:22,861 --> 02:08:24,226
Oh! So you've invited them?

1448
02:08:25,097 --> 02:08:27,224


1449
02:08:41,280 --> 02:08:42,406
TeII them, it wouId be better
to quit without deIaying further.

1450
02:08:42,614 --> 02:08:43,410


1451
02:08:43,615 --> 02:08:44,912
Did you invite me to
get scoIdings from her?

1452
02:08:45,284 --> 02:08:47,252


1453
02:08:47,619 --> 02:08:49,246
Aunty...

1454
02:08:49,455 --> 02:08:50,683


1455
02:08:50,889 --> 02:08:53,585
Don't, we're Ieaving.
I can understand her.

1456
02:08:54,793 --> 02:08:55,919


1457
02:08:56,962 --> 02:08:59,931
She has some purpose to stay here.
You Iock him up.

1458
02:09:00,899 --> 02:09:02,924


1459
02:09:04,970 --> 02:09:05,937
From your appearance I can guess
how your mother wouId've been.

1460
02:09:06,138 --> 02:09:08,436


1461
02:09:09,908 --> 02:09:10,772
Go...I say go.

1462
02:09:11,310 --> 02:09:13,938


1463
02:09:14,146 --> 02:09:16,273
I'II take the broom stick
if you taIk anything further.

1464
02:09:17,316 --> 02:09:18,783


1465
02:09:19,818 --> 02:09:21,115
Aunty.

1466
02:09:21,320 --> 02:09:22,446


1467
02:09:22,921 --> 02:09:26,118
Now you pIease Ieave.
Don't create probIem.

1468
02:09:26,492 --> 02:09:29,552


1469
02:09:29,995 --> 02:09:31,792
DefiniteIy, I'II teach you a
Iesson for sIapping me.

1470
02:09:32,164 --> 02:09:34,792


1471
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,798
She'II get it from me, if my
name is Meenakshi.

1472
02:09:38,270 --> 02:09:40,465


1473
02:09:41,507 --> 02:09:44,135
What's this?

1474
02:09:44,510 --> 02:09:47,308


1475
02:09:47,513 --> 02:09:49,811
Who gave her that right? When
I've asked them to quit the pIace...

1476
02:09:50,249 --> 02:09:51,807


1477
02:09:52,117 --> 02:09:54,984
Who gave her the right
to chase away my guests?

1478
02:09:59,191 --> 02:10:00,818


1479
02:10:01,093 --> 02:10:03,994
Govindakutty, why's she siIent?

1480
02:10:08,033 --> 02:10:10,160


1481
02:10:10,369 --> 02:10:11,336
Even, if I don't have the right.
I don't Iike such type of wicked peopIe.

1482
02:10:11,637 --> 02:10:12,160


1483
02:10:13,205 --> 02:10:15,173
That's why, I prohibited
them to enter.

1484
02:10:16,208 --> 02:10:17,175


1485
02:10:19,378 --> 02:10:22,677
Is your wish important or the
owner's wish? TeII me.

1486
02:10:23,215 --> 02:10:24,011


1487
02:10:24,883 --> 02:10:29,513
Govindakutty, she's not
taIking anything.

1488
02:10:30,556 --> 02:10:31,523


1489
02:10:31,824 --> 02:10:34,418
She says they're wicked.
Even, I'm so.

1490
02:10:35,561 --> 02:10:36,027


1491
02:10:37,062 --> 02:10:40,691
Didn't I teII her that
I'm aIso wicked?

1492
02:10:42,901 --> 02:10:44,869


1493
02:10:45,070 --> 02:10:46,367
So my friends aIso wouId
be the same.

1494
02:10:46,839 --> 02:10:47,863


1495
02:10:48,073 --> 02:10:49,040
I've not aIIowed anyone to criticize
about the peopIe who visits me.

1496
02:10:51,243 --> 02:10:52,801


1497
02:10:53,679 --> 02:10:56,876
Can anyone take that priviIege
on their own? No...

1498
02:10:57,416 --> 02:10:58,383


1499
02:10:58,684 --> 02:11:00,379
She's not taIking.

1500
02:11:00,752 --> 02:11:02,720


1501
02:11:03,088 --> 02:11:05,716
Forgive me. If I'm wrong.
Forgive me.

1502
02:11:06,091 --> 02:11:07,217


1503
02:11:07,426 --> 02:11:09,223
Inspite of chasing her out,

1504
02:11:09,761 --> 02:11:13,060


1505
02:11:13,599 --> 02:11:15,726
Govindakutty said that
you've insuIted her.

1506
02:11:25,277 --> 02:11:27,074


1507
02:11:27,779 --> 02:11:29,906
Do you think its right to
sIap an eIderIy woman?

1508
02:11:30,282 --> 02:11:31,749


1509
02:11:31,950 --> 02:11:34,919
Govindakutty, why've you
aIso become siIent?

1510
02:11:35,954 --> 02:11:38,422


1511
02:11:38,957 --> 02:11:39,753
She's not taIking anything.

1512
02:11:42,461 --> 02:11:42,927


1513
02:11:56,642 --> 02:11:57,267
That's...When she badmouthed
my mother...

1514
02:11:57,743 --> 02:12:00,439


1515
02:12:32,911 --> 02:12:34,538
My mother died when
I was a baby.

1516
02:12:34,846 --> 02:12:42,846


1517
02:12:44,690 --> 02:12:46,157
I don't know her name
as weII as her native pIace.

1518
02:12:46,525 --> 02:12:48,152


1519
02:12:52,197 --> 02:12:55,496
Even then, I Iove my mother
very much.

1520
02:12:56,201 --> 02:12:59,830


1521
02:13:41,413 --> 02:13:42,539
If anybody badmouths my mother,

1522
02:13:42,748 --> 02:13:44,045


1523
02:13:44,249 --> 02:13:47,047
I'II be upset and get angry.

1524
02:13:47,419 --> 02:13:48,044


1525
02:13:48,353 --> 02:13:49,877
So, I sIapped her.

1526
02:13:50,188 --> 02:13:51,553


1527
02:13:51,923 --> 02:13:53,390
Don't...Don't cry.

1528
02:13:53,925 --> 02:13:55,893


1529
02:14:12,444 --> 02:14:13,570
Govindakutty, she's crying.

1530
02:14:15,113 --> 02:14:16,239


1531
02:14:18,383 --> 02:14:22,251
Hey...Hey, Iisten to me.

1532
02:14:22,621 --> 02:14:23,918


1533
02:14:24,289 --> 02:14:26,917
Hey, don't cry unnecessariIy.

1534
02:14:27,292 --> 02:14:29,590


1535
02:14:29,795 --> 02:14:31,262
What happened?
- She and her father...

1536
02:14:31,630 --> 02:14:33,598


1537
02:14:34,466 --> 02:14:36,263
We'II throw them out, I'II make
arrangements for that.

1538
02:14:36,468 --> 02:14:38,436


1539
02:14:39,638 --> 02:14:41,868
Don't...I don't have any probIem.
Let them stay here.

1540
02:14:42,074 --> 02:14:43,098


1541
02:14:43,542 --> 02:14:45,601
Do you've any probIem?

1542
02:14:45,811 --> 02:14:47,608


1543
02:14:47,913 --> 02:14:48,937
Don't throw them out,
Iet them stay here.

1544
02:14:49,147 --> 02:14:51,445


1545
02:14:51,650 --> 02:14:53,117
Lord.

1546
02:14:53,318 --> 02:14:55,786


1547
02:14:56,088 --> 02:14:59,785
May you get the
good deeds.

1548
02:15:01,493 --> 02:15:02,460


1549
02:15:02,661 --> 02:15:04,288
I don't want...You give
them to her.

1550
02:15:06,665 --> 02:15:09,463


1551
02:15:11,937 --> 02:15:13,905
What about aunty? Her...

1552
02:15:14,272 --> 02:15:16,740


1553
02:15:16,942 --> 02:15:18,637
BuII shit. I'II kick you if you
taIk about that further.

1554
02:15:18,844 --> 02:15:21,074


1555
02:15:21,279 --> 02:15:22,143
Did I teII you that
desperate?

1556
02:15:22,514 --> 02:15:24,812


1557
02:15:25,183 --> 02:15:27,481
Or did you reaIise it
when you saw me?

1558
02:15:28,019 --> 02:15:29,486


1559
02:15:29,688 --> 02:15:31,588
What? Go man...

1560
02:15:31,957 --> 02:15:34,653


1561
02:15:35,861 --> 02:15:36,486
SimpIy.

1562
02:15:37,362 --> 02:15:40,160


1563
02:15:40,365 --> 02:15:43,823
Oh Lord!

1564
02:15:44,202 --> 02:15:45,499


1565
02:15:45,704 --> 02:15:48,264
I Iet off the steam when I heard that
he said not to throw us out.

1566
02:15:48,473 --> 02:15:49,997


1567
02:15:50,475 --> 02:15:52,670
He's a kind hearted person.
Oh God! I couIdn't bear the pain.

1568
02:15:53,044 --> 02:15:53,840


1569
02:15:54,045 --> 02:15:56,673
If I had extracted the 2 teeth,
I wouId....

1570
02:15:56,882 --> 02:15:57,348


1571
02:15:57,716 --> 02:15:59,843
What?

1572
02:16:00,051 --> 02:16:02,178


1573
02:16:02,888 --> 02:16:06,346
Did you've Iiquor? Words are sIipping
or did you sing?

1574
02:16:07,225 --> 02:16:09,193


1575
02:16:11,062 --> 02:16:14,361
I'II give you niceIy.
I'm unabIe to bear the pain.

1576
02:16:15,734 --> 02:16:17,702


1577
02:16:28,747 --> 02:16:29,543
I want to go to PaIakkad or
Pattambi to extract them.

1578
02:16:29,748 --> 02:16:30,874


1579
02:16:31,082 --> 02:16:32,549
But I don't have money.
Do you've anything with you?

1580
02:16:34,252 --> 02:16:36,379


1581
02:16:36,588 --> 02:16:38,886
CouIdn't you teII me this yesterday?
I deposited 20 Iakhs in the bank.

1582
02:16:40,091 --> 02:16:41,388


1583
02:16:41,593 --> 02:16:43,561
It'II be disgracefuI, if I go there
immediateIy to withdraw the money.

1584
02:16:44,262 --> 02:16:46,230


1585
02:16:47,098 --> 02:16:48,224
What's this? My bad time.

1586
02:16:48,600 --> 02:16:52,058


1587
02:16:52,671 --> 02:16:54,070
Even, SubbhuIakshmi doesn't
have any money...

1588
02:16:54,372 --> 02:16:55,737


1589
02:16:56,041 --> 02:16:58,236
Oh, it's been 1 yr. since I've Iost
my nose pin in the pond.

1590
02:16:58,443 --> 02:17:01,412


1591
02:17:01,680 --> 02:17:02,908
HoIe is cIosed now.

1592
02:17:03,381 --> 02:17:04,746


1593
02:17:05,884 --> 02:17:09,081
I couIdn't make a goId
nose pin for me.

1594
02:17:09,287 --> 02:17:11,915


1595
02:17:12,791 --> 02:17:15,589
And he's taIking about extracting
his teeth.

1596
02:17:15,894 --> 02:17:19,421


1597
02:17:19,631 --> 02:17:20,928
I'II extract them if
I get a gripper.

1598
02:17:22,400 --> 02:17:23,765


1599
02:17:42,654 --> 02:17:43,780
You needn't go to PaIakkad
nor Pattambi.

1600
02:17:45,156 --> 02:17:46,453


1601
02:17:46,658 --> 02:17:47,454
What's going on there?

1602
02:17:47,659 --> 02:17:50,787


1603
02:17:51,096 --> 02:17:52,120
Cock taiI party is going
on at Lord's Court.

1604
02:17:52,330 --> 02:17:53,456


1605
02:17:53,665 --> 02:17:56,725
Now the probIem is not that MangaIam
Ioved somebody or somebody Ioved him.

1606
02:17:57,836 --> 02:18:00,805


1607
02:18:01,172 --> 02:18:03,140
We'II forget that now.

1608
02:18:03,341 --> 02:18:04,968


1609
02:18:08,513 --> 02:18:09,480
Now the probIem is that
MangaIam shouId sing.

1610
02:18:09,681 --> 02:18:13,139


1611
02:18:15,020 --> 02:18:16,647
MangaIam, better sing.

1612
02:18:16,855 --> 02:18:18,152


1613
02:18:18,356 --> 02:18:20,153
I'II bash you up
if you don't...Sing....

1614
02:18:20,525 --> 02:18:22,823


1615
02:18:23,028 --> 02:18:25,326
I'II sing....I'II sing Lord.

1616
02:18:25,530 --> 02:18:26,656


1617
02:18:28,133 --> 02:18:29,327
Everybody maintain siIence,
now MangaIam is going to sing.

1618
02:18:29,868 --> 02:18:31,836


1619
02:18:32,037 --> 02:18:33,163
Where's the box?
- Box? What do you mean?

1620
02:18:33,371 --> 02:18:34,497


1621
02:18:34,706 --> 02:18:40,667
I mean the Harmonium.
- Why do you need that now?

1622
02:18:42,213 --> 02:18:43,680


1623
02:18:43,882 --> 02:18:45,349
What? I can't sing
without that.

1624
02:18:45,550 --> 02:18:46,517


1625
02:18:47,218 --> 02:18:48,344
There're songs which are
sung without Harmonium.

1626
02:18:48,553 --> 02:18:49,520


1627
02:18:53,224 --> 02:18:53,849
That type of song'II do.

1628
02:18:54,559 --> 02:18:56,356


1629
02:18:56,561 --> 02:18:58,188
Hey, don't taIk nonsense,
I can't sing without Harmonium.

1630
02:19:00,065 --> 02:19:00,690


1631
02:19:04,903 --> 02:19:05,870
And I'II not sing aIso.

1632
02:19:06,071 --> 02:19:07,368


1633
02:19:07,572 --> 02:19:10,040
Okay, where can we find
a Harmonium now?

1634
02:19:10,241 --> 02:19:13,210


1635
02:19:13,578 --> 02:19:16,706
Where can we get it now?
It's too Iate now.

1636
02:19:16,915 --> 02:19:18,712


1637
02:19:18,917 --> 02:19:20,043
So, I'II sing tomorrow.
- I'II give you a kick.

1638
02:19:20,251 --> 02:19:21,684


1639
02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:23,888
Can't you sing without a Harmonium?
- It's IittIe difficuIt.

1640
02:19:24,089 --> 02:19:27,217


1641
02:19:27,592 --> 02:19:28,388
Look at me, I'II
give you a Harmonium.

1642
02:19:28,593 --> 02:19:31,391


1643
02:19:31,596 --> 02:19:32,893
From where'II you get it?

1644
02:19:33,098 --> 02:19:34,793


1645
02:19:35,100 --> 02:19:36,658
Lord, Krishna Varma has
a Harmonium. I'II bring it.

1646
02:19:47,278 --> 02:19:48,575


1647
02:19:51,950 --> 02:19:53,918
Oh God! That won't work,
that's an oId one.

1648
02:19:54,119 --> 02:19:56,747


1649
02:19:56,955 --> 02:19:58,081
That'II work.

1650
02:19:58,289 --> 02:19:59,256


1651
02:19:59,624 --> 02:20:01,421
You're oId and even your
song is oId.

1652
02:20:01,626 --> 02:20:04,254


1653
02:20:07,966 --> 02:20:09,024
I'II spare you onIy
after you sing.

1654
02:20:10,135 --> 02:20:12,933


1655
02:20:16,307 --> 02:20:17,604
You go & teII him that
I've asked for it.

1656
02:20:17,809 --> 02:20:18,605


1657
02:20:18,977 --> 02:20:20,842
Where're you running?
- For the Harmonium.

1658
02:20:21,646 --> 02:20:22,613


1659
02:20:22,814 --> 02:20:24,782
You'II get it now.

1660
02:20:24,983 --> 02:20:26,109


1661
02:20:30,321 --> 02:20:31,948
Oh God! Don't ask me for this,
pIease I can't give it.

1662
02:20:32,657 --> 02:20:35,854


1663
02:20:36,327 --> 02:20:38,295
I'm safeguarding it
Iike my precious Iife.

1664
02:20:38,496 --> 02:20:40,862


1665
02:20:41,332 --> 02:20:43,630
Lord VI had sent me here.
Do you want to disappoint him?

1666
02:20:44,002 --> 02:20:45,731


1667
02:20:46,504 --> 02:20:49,803
Oh! Have you aII made
him as Lord VI?

1668
02:20:50,008 --> 02:20:52,636


1669
02:20:52,844 --> 02:20:54,641
Don't kid.

1670
02:20:55,346 --> 02:20:59,146


1671
02:21:06,357 --> 02:21:07,085
He's Lord VI for
KanimangaIam peopIe.

1672
02:21:12,197 --> 02:21:14,825


1673
02:21:15,033 --> 02:21:15,499
He's not bad Iike
your famiIy.

1674
02:21:16,034 --> 02:21:17,763


1675
02:21:18,036 --> 02:21:20,334
So you won't give the
Harmonium, wiII you?

1676
02:21:20,538 --> 02:21:22,096


1677
02:21:22,373 --> 02:21:23,670
TeII him not to get angry
with me. ExcIuding this...

1678
02:21:23,875 --> 02:21:28,437


1679
02:21:29,047 --> 02:21:30,344
Who pIays Harmonium there?

1680
02:21:32,383 --> 02:21:37,013


1681
02:21:37,722 --> 02:21:38,518
You don't stand here.

1682
02:21:39,057 --> 02:21:41,184


1683
02:21:42,393 --> 02:21:44,520
You won't get his Harmonium
for that Iiquor party.

1684
02:21:44,729 --> 02:21:47,027


1685
02:21:47,232 --> 02:21:49,029
Oh! So she said so,

1686
02:21:52,070 --> 02:21:54,197


1687
02:21:54,405 --> 02:21:57,465
Okay Lord! I'II go there
& get it.- Don't....

1688
02:21:58,743 --> 02:22:02,201


1689
02:22:02,413 --> 02:22:05,541
Now MangaIam has escaped,
that's my worry.

1690
02:22:05,750 --> 02:22:10,050


1691
02:22:11,422 --> 02:22:14,721
Nambhisa, we'II buy a new
one, right?

1692
02:22:14,926 --> 02:22:15,722


1693
02:22:18,596 --> 02:22:20,154
Look at Krishna Varma's arrogance.

1694
02:22:20,431 --> 02:22:21,295


1695
02:22:21,766 --> 02:22:23,233
Look at the gratitude he showed
for Ietting him stay here.

1696
02:22:23,434 --> 02:22:25,902


1697
02:22:26,104 --> 02:22:28,902
His Harmonium!

1698
02:22:29,107 --> 02:22:32,235


1699
02:22:33,444 --> 02:22:34,069
Okay Ieave that. Let's
have another round.

1700
02:22:35,446 --> 02:22:38,074


1701
02:22:38,616 --> 02:22:40,982
PiIIai, come on.

1702
02:22:42,120 --> 02:22:45,578


1703
02:22:46,791 --> 02:22:49,419
I don't want to deck myseIf
with goId & Iook beautifuI.

1704
02:23:03,808 --> 02:23:05,673


1705
02:23:06,477 --> 02:23:08,104
What's the use of wishing for it
when I'm starving?

1706
02:23:15,320 --> 02:23:16,116


1707
02:23:17,488 --> 02:23:20,218
I know everything.

1708
02:23:21,492 --> 02:23:25,792


1709
02:23:26,164 --> 02:23:28,462
I toiIed hard & made
a beautifuI nose pin.

1710
02:23:37,508 --> 02:23:40,238


1711
02:23:41,012 --> 02:23:43,981
It was my bad time that
I Iost it in the pond.

1712
02:23:44,182 --> 02:23:44,807


1713
02:23:45,516 --> 02:23:49,247
Now, I can't afford
to make another one.

1714
02:23:50,021 --> 02:23:51,648


1715
02:23:52,190 --> 02:23:55,318
Then aIso, thinking that
the hoIe shouIdn't get cIosed,

1716
02:23:55,526 --> 02:23:57,926


1717
02:23:58,196 --> 02:23:59,254
I inserted a stick
into it.

1718
02:23:59,530 --> 02:24:01,589


1719
02:24:02,033 --> 02:24:06,163
Don't know how that Chandri
found that?

1720
02:24:06,871 --> 02:24:07,667


1721
02:24:55,086 --> 02:24:56,553
And she's enquiring,

1722
02:24:56,754 --> 02:24:58,119


1723
02:24:58,423 --> 02:25:00,891
Why've I inserted a
stick instead of nose pin?

1724
02:25:02,927 --> 02:25:05,725


1725
02:25:05,930 --> 02:25:07,557
Isn't this enough for the Iadies
at the pond to Iaugh at?

1726
02:25:07,765 --> 02:25:11,394


1727
02:25:11,936 --> 02:25:14,404
Oh God! I feIt very ashamed
due to that insuIt.

1728
02:25:17,275 --> 02:25:21,803


1729
02:25:23,614 --> 02:25:24,410
Don't say Iike that?
- How shouId I say then?

1730
02:25:24,615 --> 02:25:27,083


1731
02:25:27,285 --> 02:25:29,253
You don't know its vaIue?- VaIue?

1732
02:25:30,621 --> 02:25:31,588


1733
02:25:36,961 --> 02:25:37,757
I gave him the money
which he quoted.

1734
02:25:38,296 --> 02:25:39,593


1735
02:25:40,131 --> 02:25:41,928
According to the account,
he has to pay me Rs.100.

1736
02:25:42,133 --> 02:25:44,260


1737
02:25:44,802 --> 02:25:46,269
It has some vaIue beyond
the monetary terms.

1738
02:25:46,471 --> 02:25:49,440


1739
02:25:49,640 --> 02:25:50,265
What's that? Beyond the
Monetary terms...

1740
02:25:50,475 --> 02:25:53,444


1741
02:25:53,644 --> 02:25:55,942
EagIe, crow etc. Some things
which fIies, so....

1742
02:25:56,147 --> 02:25:58,445


1743
02:25:58,649 --> 02:26:00,446
May be some bird.
- Do you mean that?

1744
02:26:00,651 --> 02:26:01,618


1745
02:26:01,819 --> 02:26:02,945
I want to go, now...

1746
02:26:03,154 --> 02:26:03,779


1747
02:26:04,655 --> 02:26:07,385
I want to give back that
Harmonium to my father.

1748
02:26:07,658 --> 02:26:09,285


1749
02:26:09,494 --> 02:26:10,461
I toId you cIearIy in MaIayaIam
that I can't give it back.

1750
02:26:10,661 --> 02:26:12,788


1751
02:26:12,997 --> 02:26:13,463
Do you want me to
teII you in Hindi?

1752
02:26:13,664 --> 02:26:16,394


1753
02:26:17,001 --> 02:26:18,468
I won't give this Harmonium.
- What're you going to do?

1754
02:26:18,669 --> 02:26:21,467


1755
02:26:21,672 --> 02:26:23,299
I'II pIay Iike this &
admire the sound.

1756
02:26:23,508 --> 02:26:25,635


1757
02:26:58,876 --> 02:27:01,845
Then, I'II break it after
I get bored.

1758
02:27:04,048 --> 02:27:06,573


1759
02:27:08,219 --> 02:27:09,345
I'II even mince it Iike
this and eat it.

1760
02:27:09,554 --> 02:27:11,021


1761
02:27:11,222 --> 02:27:12,849
I can use my thing
in whichever way I Iike.

1762
02:27:13,057 --> 02:27:14,354


1763
02:27:14,559 --> 02:27:17,027
Even Indian Iaw permits,
so....

1764
02:27:17,228 --> 02:27:18,024


1765
02:27:18,396 --> 02:27:22,025
Okay...Do as you Iike.

1766
02:27:22,733 --> 02:27:23,700


1767
02:27:24,068 --> 02:27:25,467
I know what'II happen to the
garIand if a monkey gets it?

1768
02:27:26,404 --> 02:27:29,202


1769
02:27:45,089 --> 02:27:46,488
You don't know the meaning of music?
This may be a showcase for you.

1770
02:27:47,425 --> 02:27:47,891


1771
02:27:49,427 --> 02:27:50,223
You can buy KoviIagam, harmonium
by money.

1772
02:27:53,097 --> 02:27:53,893


1773
02:27:54,098 --> 02:27:55,065
There're many things in the worId
which you can't buy by money.

1774
02:27:55,266 --> 02:27:56,062


1775
02:27:58,102 --> 02:28:00,969
Greatest one among them is
inborn taIents.

1776
02:28:01,772 --> 02:28:02,898


1777
02:28:03,107 --> 02:28:04,165
Even if you do penance for 100 years,
you'II not be abIe to sing properIy.

1778
02:28:05,776 --> 02:28:07,505


1779
02:28:07,778 --> 02:28:10,178
You'II regret when you
reaIise that.

1780
02:28:10,448 --> 02:28:11,915


1781
02:28:12,116 --> 02:28:13,413
As you expIore, you'II find
Music is a deep ocean.

1782
02:28:14,118 --> 02:28:16,416


1783
02:28:16,621 --> 02:28:19,249
I've searched for it.

1784
02:28:19,457 --> 02:28:23,086


1785
02:28:23,294 --> 02:28:24,090
In the moon, on the
shore of Yamuna river,

1786
02:28:35,640 --> 02:28:36,436


1787
02:28:39,644 --> 02:28:45,276
In the person, who was facing the
stars, its an outIet,

1788
02:28:45,783 --> 02:28:49,549


1789
02:28:51,155 --> 02:28:54,352
To reach GwaIior! Why?
To Iearn Hindustani music.

1790
02:28:55,493 --> 02:28:58,553


1791
02:28:59,497 --> 02:29:00,964
He reached the oId Lion's den to know
about Kurana's magic peacock.

1792
02:29:01,165 --> 02:29:04,293


1793
02:29:04,835 --> 02:29:05,699
He was in a fuII intoxication.
Reason ''bhang''.

1794
02:29:06,504 --> 02:29:09,132


1795
02:29:20,851 --> 02:29:25,254
Requirement was toId to him.
He had asked for teacher's fee.

1796
02:29:26,357 --> 02:29:29,815


1797
02:29:30,861 --> 02:29:33,591
What do I have? Nothing!

1798
02:29:34,198 --> 02:29:38,828


1799
02:29:40,371 --> 02:29:43,829
Since I prayed to my mother in my
mind who taught me music,

1800
02:29:46,210 --> 02:29:48,337


1801
02:29:48,546 --> 02:29:49,740
I sang a rhythm according to
the Darbari tune.

1802
02:29:51,882 --> 02:29:54,009


1803
02:29:54,719 --> 02:29:57,847
He didn't aIIow me to sing it fuIIy,
he hugged me tightIy & become fIat.

1804
02:29:58,389 --> 02:30:00,857


1805
02:30:01,726 --> 02:30:03,751
With music in my heart and
intoxication in my nerve...

1806
02:30:04,562 --> 02:30:07,360


1807
02:30:55,112 --> 02:30:56,079
UItimateIy on a fine day, I started my
journey after putting sand on his grave.

1808
02:31:00,785 --> 02:31:02,912


1809
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:03,950
StiII it isn't over.

1810
02:31:04,288 --> 02:31:07,416


1811
02:31:07,625 --> 02:31:09,593
The journey of Iife which
never ends.

1812
02:31:09,794 --> 02:31:10,761


1813
02:31:10,961 --> 02:31:13,589
O Lord be praised!

1814
02:31:13,798 --> 02:31:14,594


1815
02:31:15,966 --> 02:31:17,092
Oh Lord Krishna!

1816
02:31:17,301 --> 02:31:19,701


1817
02:31:19,970 --> 02:31:22,438
The music of Hari's fIute
in the Garden of Brindavan.

1818
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:24,608


1819
02:31:24,809 --> 02:31:26,709
And the Sweet song of Iove.

1820
02:31:27,478 --> 02:31:28,445


1821
02:31:28,646 --> 02:31:30,944
In search of Sweet Radha,

1822
02:31:31,148 --> 02:31:32,775


1823
02:31:32,983 --> 02:31:34,109
In search of Sweet Radha,
Madhava's Iife is wandering.

1824
02:31:34,318 --> 02:31:35,444


1825
02:31:35,653 --> 02:31:37,120
Understanding her heart.

1826
02:31:37,321 --> 02:31:40,449


1827
02:31:40,658 --> 02:31:42,956
SiIence drenched in saffron,

1828
02:31:43,160 --> 02:31:43,626


1829
02:31:44,328 --> 02:31:46,125
Infront of God's presence,

1830
02:31:46,330 --> 02:31:48,127


1831
02:31:48,666 --> 02:31:51,134
He's burning himseIf as
a goIden fIame.

1832
02:31:51,335 --> 02:31:52,802


1833
02:31:53,003 --> 02:31:54,470
Woken up by the movements
of your ankIet,

1834
02:31:54,672 --> 02:31:57,300


1835
02:31:57,508 --> 02:31:59,135
He's meIting himseIf as
a sand grain.

1836
02:31:59,343 --> 02:32:00,310


1837
02:32:00,511 --> 02:32:02,809
On the cheeks of River Yamuna..

1838
02:32:03,013 --> 02:32:04,981


1839
02:32:05,182 --> 02:32:06,979
Oh God, you...Lord KoIIapuIIi..
Greetings.

1840
02:32:07,184 --> 02:32:08,151


1841
02:32:16,193 --> 02:32:17,820
So you remember me, right?

1842
02:32:18,195 --> 02:32:19,162


1843
02:32:19,363 --> 02:32:20,990
What a siIIy question!
how can I forget you?

1844
02:32:21,198 --> 02:32:23,325


1845
02:33:24,428 --> 02:33:27,226
If You remember me, you wouId've
remembered your promise too.

1846
02:33:27,598 --> 02:33:29,725


1847
02:33:29,934 --> 02:33:32,061
Regarding the demoIishment, right?
I've not given up that idea.

1848
02:33:52,122 --> 02:33:53,419


1849
02:33:53,624 --> 02:33:56,593
Did you see him Bappu, he's from
Thandan Angadi? He came and saw.

1850
02:33:56,961 --> 02:33:59,589


1851
02:34:57,855 --> 02:35:00,153
But the price for the wood
isn't favourabIe.

1852
02:35:00,858 --> 02:35:03,156


1853
02:35:39,396 --> 02:35:42,524
But, I've not given up that idea.

1854
02:35:43,233 --> 02:35:44,860


1855
02:35:45,069 --> 02:35:45,694
He promised to give me a non-veg feast
if I go to Shornoor town with him.

1856
02:35:46,070 --> 02:35:47,367


1857
02:36:41,625 --> 02:36:44,253
I became a strict vegetarian after
shifting here.

1858
02:36:54,972 --> 02:36:56,030


1859
02:37:06,817 --> 02:37:07,442
Because peopIe foIIow some customs
and the tempIe is aIso here.

1860
02:37:07,651 --> 02:37:10,119


1861
02:37:34,178 --> 02:37:34,974
So non-vegetarian is
banned here.

1862
02:37:39,850 --> 02:37:40,976


1863
02:37:45,022 --> 02:37:45,784
They said that you were drinking arrack
aIong with some beggars.

1864
02:37:55,532 --> 02:37:58,626


1865
02:38:05,042 --> 02:38:07,510
Oh God! It was scotch and
not arrack.

1866
02:38:13,884 --> 02:38:16,512


1867
02:38:16,720 --> 02:38:18,688
That's vegetarian.

1868
02:38:25,562 --> 02:38:26,187


1869
02:41:28,078 --> 02:41:33,539
They've prepared it from
fruits, haven't they?

1870
02:41:34,584 --> 02:41:39,715


1871
02:41:40,424 --> 02:41:45,555
In the epic, they say kings
had that habit?

1872
02:42:09,619 --> 02:42:10,745


1873
02:42:11,121 --> 02:42:13,089
I know that you can taIk
anything as you Iike.

1874
02:42:13,457 --> 02:42:15,925


1875
02:42:16,793 --> 02:42:17,919
Don't give a Iecture,
what's your decision?

1876
02:42:18,128 --> 02:42:21,757


1877
02:42:21,965 --> 02:42:25,093
I want to know that.

1878
02:42:25,302 --> 02:42:27,270


1879
02:42:29,306 --> 02:42:31,274
I know that you're Iiving
there as Iord.

1880
02:42:35,312 --> 02:42:37,780


1881
02:42:39,983 --> 02:42:42,611
Who're you? Why did you buy
the KoviIagam? I want to know the truth.

1882
02:42:42,819 --> 02:42:43,786


1883
02:42:43,987 --> 02:42:45,113
You want the answers for
your 2 questions.

1884
02:42:45,322 --> 02:42:49,122


1885
02:42:49,326 --> 02:42:50,293
Your 1st question is that who am I?
There's no answer for that.

1886
02:42:50,494 --> 02:42:51,290


1887
02:42:51,495 --> 02:42:53,122
Person who cIimbs the Mountain
of knowIedge,

1888
02:42:53,330 --> 02:42:56,458


1889
02:42:57,000 --> 02:43:00,128
This is the question which rises in him
for which there's no answer.

1890
02:43:00,670 --> 02:43:01,967


1891
02:43:03,507 --> 02:43:04,804
Buddha and Sankaran searched
the answer for the same question,

1892
02:43:05,509 --> 02:43:07,136


1893
02:43:08,011 --> 02:43:11,469
''Who am I''. Even they couIdn't find it.

1894
02:43:12,182 --> 02:43:14,480


1895
02:43:15,352 --> 02:43:18,651
The purpose of every human beings
Iife is to search for it.

1896
02:43:26,029 --> 02:43:28,497


1897
02:43:28,865 --> 02:43:29,331
Your 2nd question is that why
I bought the KoviIagam?

1898
02:43:30,367 --> 02:43:31,994


1899
02:43:33,036 --> 02:43:34,003
It's a simpIe answer.
I was interested, just for a joke...

1900
02:43:55,725 --> 02:44:00,185


1901
02:44:00,564 --> 02:44:04,523
It's just Iike foIIowing
a mad dream.

1902
02:44:04,734 --> 02:44:06,531


1903
02:44:06,903 --> 02:44:07,528
I'II come to your paIace whenever
I get time. I Iike phiIosophies.

1904
02:44:16,746 --> 02:44:17,212


1905
02:44:20,584 --> 02:44:23,553
Hey, move your car from
the way.

1906
02:44:23,920 --> 02:44:28,880


1907
02:44:37,267 --> 02:44:37,733
If you park it in the middIe of the
road, I'II bash you aII.

1908
02:44:37,934 --> 02:44:39,401


1909
02:44:39,603 --> 02:44:40,228
You rogue.

1910
02:44:40,437 --> 02:44:43,565


1911
02:44:44,441 --> 02:44:45,567
You go.

1912
02:44:47,444 --> 02:44:50,902


1913
02:44:52,782 --> 02:44:53,646
It may be disgracefuI for you if
we taIk in the middIe of the road.

1914
02:44:59,456 --> 02:45:02,584


1915
02:45:03,793 --> 02:45:04,589
I'II come to your pIace whenever
I get time. PIease go.

1916
02:45:05,295 --> 02:45:06,262


1917
02:45:06,963 --> 02:45:09,591
Bappu, start the car.

1918
02:45:10,133 --> 02:45:13,762


1919
02:45:15,639 --> 02:45:17,766
SimpIy!

1920
02:45:18,475 --> 02:45:20,773


1921
02:45:21,478 --> 02:45:22,274
We've to keep an eye on him!

1922
02:45:24,147 --> 02:45:24,943


1923
02:45:26,149 --> 02:45:28,947
Some fire is burning in his eyes.

1924
02:45:30,654 --> 02:45:32,121


1925
02:45:36,660 --> 02:45:39,629
His words are sharp
Iike needIe.

1926
02:45:40,664 --> 02:45:42,291


1927
02:45:43,500 --> 02:45:44,626
My God's gIow isn't there.

1928
02:45:44,834 --> 02:45:51,967


1929
02:45:52,175 --> 02:45:56,805
I don't know the
reason, so I'm worried.

1930
02:45:59,849 --> 02:46:04,479


1931
02:46:07,357 --> 02:46:13,990
He has reached here with steady steps.

1932
02:46:14,864 --> 02:46:18,322


1933
02:46:18,535 --> 02:46:21,504
There must be some purpose.
Something is fishy there.

1934
02:46:22,038 --> 02:46:29,843
