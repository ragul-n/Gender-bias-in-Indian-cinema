1
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:14,789
Do you know why l have
summoned you gentlemen here?

2
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:21,588
l want to know which one of you
was responsible for us not getting...

3
00:03:21,588 --> 00:03:25,788
the contract for supplying steel in Kanpur.

4
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,621
Mehrchand...
- Yes, sir?

5
00:03:28,621 --> 00:03:32,212
You are the one who fills the tenders.

6
00:03:32,387 --> 00:03:34,388
Can you tell me why our tender was rejected?

7
00:03:34,388 --> 00:03:40,150
Each tender l prepare is based on
the rates given by every department.

8
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:45,222
l believe that the rate was too high.
-Why?

9
00:03:45,222 --> 00:03:50,620
l had quoted the figures after
consulting Mr. Mahindra Srivastav.

10
00:03:50,987 --> 00:03:54,587
Why did you quote a rate
which was not acceptable?

11
00:03:54,587 --> 00:03:59,952
Well, we have very
little stock of coal.

12
00:04:00,487 --> 00:04:01,282
ln addition, you are aware that
we have a dearth of wagons too.

13
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,719
For this contract, we would
have had to buy a lot of coal...

14
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,119
at a much higher price than the market rate.

15
00:04:08,119 --> 00:04:11,881
Did you meet the Coal Commissioner
to find out the availability of coal?

16
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:14,519
There was very little time.

17
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,519
We had to register the tender
at 10 a.m. the next morning.

18
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,746
Did you meet the
Commissioner or not?

19
00:04:19,985 --> 00:04:20,418
l was waiting for him at his house till midnight.

20
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:24,443
He had not yet returned from
the defense Council meeting.

21
00:04:25,853 --> 00:04:29,886
Do not speak in your defense! l am
concerned with work, not your talks!

22
00:04:29,886 --> 00:04:32,253
The conference was going
on in Mumbai, not Delhi!

23
00:04:32,253 --> 00:04:35,252
Why did you return from there? You
should have waited all night for him!

24
00:04:35,252 --> 00:04:38,877
But Daddy,...
- Shut up! Don't daddy me anymore!

25
00:04:38,985 --> 00:04:42,952
l'm ashamed to call you my son!
lt's a loss of Rs.500,000!

26
00:04:42,952 --> 00:04:46,816
And now, you talk big! For how
long will l go on listening to you!

27
00:04:47,117 --> 00:04:50,585
At least, learn something from
your younger brother Sunder!

28
00:04:50,585 --> 00:04:53,107
He doesn't keep talking
like you do, he works!

29
00:04:53,484 --> 00:04:55,075
He's been studying day and night
for his examinations these days!

30
00:05:37,648 --> 00:05:41,049
Well done! Our college is sending
you to Kashmir for a tournament.

31
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,776
And l am confident that you will
enhance the name of your college.

32
00:05:45,114 --> 00:05:47,705
lf your blessing is with me, trust
me, l will win the championship.

33
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:50,679
l'm sure you will. Best of luck!
- Thank you!

34
00:05:51,014 --> 00:05:52,309
What's the program for the evening?

35
00:05:52,547 --> 00:05:53,478
First tell me, where is Chintu?
- Chintu? He was here a while back.

36
00:06:00,414 --> 00:06:04,715
Oh no, Chintu! You have
changed your appearance again!

37
00:06:04,715 --> 00:06:07,482
My dear Sunder,
l am a true patriot.

38
00:06:07,482 --> 00:06:11,743
And l firmly believe in national integration.

39
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:15,347
Understand?
- No.

40
00:06:15,347 --> 00:06:19,938
National harmony.
Do you understand now?

41
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:20,547
No.
- Damn!... National unity.

42
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:24,842
l don't understand at all.
- Not yet?

43
00:06:26,013 --> 00:06:30,536
Fool! A man living in one State
loving a person from another State.

44
00:06:31,313 --> 00:06:33,346
This is called national integration.

45
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:38,937
My dream will not be realized until
l marry a girl from another State.

46
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:39,879
Understand?
- You mean you have forgotten...

47
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:43,145
the beating you got from Meena's father?

48
00:06:43,145 --> 00:06:46,945
Even if the fathers and brothers of
the girls from every State kill me...

49
00:06:46,945 --> 00:06:51,073
l will not give up my desire for national integration.

50
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:53,846
So you have your eyes on Calcutta
this time? Where did you meet her?

51
00:06:53,846 --> 00:07:00,079
She has recently shifted to
the building next to ours.

52
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:03,841
Wow! What doe-like eyes she has!
- Let's go!

53
00:07:12,444 --> 00:07:13,103
Thank you.

54
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,877
Are you coming to Kashmir or not?
- Oh sure. Why not?

55
00:07:26,877 --> 00:07:28,276
But give me an idea.
- What idea?

56
00:07:28,276 --> 00:07:33,503
To squeeze money from my
stingy father to go to Kashmir!

57
00:07:34,442 --> 00:07:37,009
Does he do the crossword puzzle?
- Yes.

58
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:40,444
Has he ever won a prize?
- Come off it! He's my father!

59
00:07:40,444 --> 00:07:44,432
And you knowthat l am renowned for
being the college's biggest duffer!

60
00:07:44,577 --> 00:07:46,338
Come on, sit in the car.

61
00:07:46,677 --> 00:07:49,643
Wait for me at home at 10 a.m.
tomorrow; l'll think of a plan.

62
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:50,969
Why? What's the matter?
- Get in, l say.

63
00:07:57,542 --> 00:08:01,565
Daddy...
- Why are you harassing me?

64
00:08:01,676 --> 00:08:09,975
when l am doing the crossword puzzle!
- Father, l had a dream today...

65
00:08:09,975 --> 00:08:16,396
that you have won the first prize
of Rs.50,000 on behalf of SMDC!

66
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,041
Really, son?
- Yes, father.

67
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,041
Just give me Rs. 1 ,000'/- on this joyous occasion.

68
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,803
Rs. 1 ,000'/-?
- By the way, l completely forgot...

69
00:08:24,574 --> 00:08:26,773
You will be thrilled to knowthat
your son is going to Kashmir...

70
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:29,775
on behalf of his college for a tennis tournament.

71
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:33,274
Just give me some money for my expenses.

72
00:08:33,274 --> 00:08:37,740
Young man, you have played these
tricks on me many times before!

73
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,774
But l will not get trapped in them now!

74
00:08:38,774 --> 00:08:44,206
Keep dreaming about Rs. 1 ,000'/-
until your dream is realized!

75
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,474
Shake hands!
- Greetings.

76
00:08:49,474 --> 00:08:51,706
How are you?

77
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:58,229
ls your name Mr. Gyanprasad?

78
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:02,905
No. My name is Gyanprasad.
He is my son Chintu.

79
00:09:02,905 --> 00:09:11,497
l was wondering how an oaf like him
could have such an intelligent name!

80
00:09:11,838 --> 00:09:13,167
You are right. l share the same opinion about him.

81
00:09:18,406 --> 00:09:19,206
My name is Sundaram Mundaram.

82
00:09:19,206 --> 00:09:25,503
Goodness me! What a fortunate man you are!

83
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:26,272
l have come from SMDC.

84
00:09:26,272 --> 00:09:32,204
Then you must have some good news!
Tell me quickly, what's the matter?

85
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:36,202
Why are you creating such a racket?

86
00:09:36,938 --> 00:09:39,238
l want to see how strong your heart is.
-lt's very strong.

87
00:09:39,238 --> 00:09:44,204
How about your pulse?
- lt races rapidly.

88
00:09:44,204 --> 00:09:47,270
Tell me quickly, what's the matter?

89
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,570
You sent Crossword No.420, didn't you?
- Yes, l did.

90
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:56,594
Goodness me!
How fortunate you are!

91
00:09:56,902 --> 00:09:58,269
The first prize of Rs.50,000'/- is won by you!

92
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:05,904
l won! l have won!

93
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:08,699
l am assured of my Rs. 1 ,000'/-!

94
00:10:10,304 --> 00:10:15,236
Watch out! Feel your moustache!

95
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:19,362
Daddy! Congratulations!

96
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:29,026
Did you see, my dream has come true?
- Yes, l admit that.

97
00:10:29,435 --> 00:10:32,367
You do? Will l get Rs. 1 ,000'/-?
- Sure.

98
00:10:32,634 --> 00:10:37,760
Here's Rs. 100'/-
Go and entertain him.

99
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:41,998
And when you return, do bring
a bottle of sleeping pills.

100
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:42,594
Sleeping pills?
- Yes.

101
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,094
For you, father?
- Not for me, but for you.

102
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,966
So that you fall into a deep
sleep after taking them.

103
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:54,968
And you keep seeing such dreams everyday!

104
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:57,490
Thank you Mr. Mundaram!

105
00:10:57,734 --> 00:10:58,995
Give me your blessings, Sir.
l'll leave.

106
00:11:05,034 --> 00:11:09,091
50,000! l have won 50,000'/- !

107
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:16,260
Okay Chintu, l'm leaving.

108
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:18,699
l owe you one. What a plan!

109
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:22,825
You had him going.
-At least you got your way.

110
00:11:23,732 --> 00:11:29,221
You have to overcome obstacles
to be successful. Look at me.

111
00:11:30,032 --> 00:11:32,827
My whole life is in front of you.

112
00:11:33,364 --> 00:11:38,387
l have worked day and night to
gain this wealth and respect.

113
00:11:44,866 --> 00:11:48,491
However foul your mood may be today,
l will say what l have to, daddy!

114
00:11:49,032 --> 00:11:51,089
l am going to Kashmir for a tennis tournament!

115
00:11:54,498 --> 00:11:57,032
My blood flows in your veins!

116
00:11:57,032 --> 00:12:00,929
This is the noble and holy
blood of the Srivastav family!

117
00:12:01,264 --> 00:12:03,031
l've great expectations from you.

118
00:12:03,031 --> 00:12:04,531
Why don't you realize that you are a Srivastav?

119
00:12:04,531 --> 00:12:10,897
Hail the Srivastav family!
- There's my son! My son!

120
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:14,230
Daddy, l...

121
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,424
Do you know about my
plans for your elder brother?

122
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:23,291
l am going to get him married
to Sir J.P. Sinha's daughter.

123
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:27,427
And you, l'm sending you to
Germany for an engineering degree.

124
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:30,259
When he returns, qualified, all
the work will be entrusted to him.

125
00:12:33,797 --> 00:12:38,126
And then watch! No firm will
be able to compete with us!

126
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,396
Daddy, l... l...
- How proud l will be...

127
00:12:41,396 --> 00:12:43,529
of both of you!

128
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:48,086
Prosperity will be bestowed on the
Srivastav family because of you!

129
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:49,929
Hey, you were going to say
something, weren't you?

130
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:54,554
Yes. l was going to say that... l mean...

131
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:57,894
l have to go to Kashmir for a tennis tournament.

132
00:12:57,894 --> 00:13:01,195
May l go?
- Of course, yes!

133
00:13:01,195 --> 00:13:03,828
- Thank You.
- But you will have to win.

134
00:13:03,828 --> 00:13:03,861
- l'll do my best. l promise.
- l know.

135
00:13:03,861 --> 00:13:10,760
There's a trunk call for you from Calcutta.

136
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,250
lt's that idiot, Goverdhan.
He's messing up every job!

137
00:13:15,626 --> 00:13:16,956
Mahindra, l may have to send you
to Calcutta a few days. Be ready.

138
00:13:20,395 --> 00:13:23,690
Let's go. Hey, hold this.
Go ahead and play.

139
00:13:25,561 --> 00:13:30,227
Brother, what's this issue about
Sir J.P. Sinha's daughter?

140
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:33,682
How about Seema then?
- Nothing will happen.

141
00:13:33,993 --> 00:13:36,391
lt's yet another scheme of my father.

142
00:13:36,726 --> 00:13:37,294
l will get married only to Seema.

143
00:13:37,294 --> 00:13:43,059
Had you been in love, we,d
have been married by now.

144
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:45,526
And l wouldn't have had to bear the
taunts of my colleagues in office.

145
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:49,480
Everybody is saying that you're only
putting on a charade of being in love.

146
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:50,959
That's an old story.

147
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,619
Perhaps you don't knowthat people
are often jealous of the ones in love.

148
00:13:58,991 --> 00:14:00,923
What do l do? l'm not getting
a chance to speak to father.

149
00:14:02,858 --> 00:14:06,790
ls that the case, or are you
unable to muster the courage?

150
00:14:07,124 --> 00:14:10,024
You speak the truth, but do not worry.

151
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:12,692
l will convince my father
when he is in a good mood.

152
00:14:12,692 --> 00:14:16,215
l wonder when that day will come.
- Very soon.

153
00:14:17,492 --> 00:14:22,788
lt's time to go and Chintu isn't here.
-Who is Chintu?

154
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:25,524
One of my old friends.
-Have l met him before?

155
00:14:25,524 --> 00:14:30,990
lt's a good thing that you haven't
because he's a bit mental.

156
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,523
No problem. lntroduce me to you girlfriend then.

157
00:14:33,523 --> 00:14:36,648
l donit have a girlfriend in my destiny.

158
00:14:36,857 --> 00:14:40,913
You have taken the prettiest girl in the world.

159
00:14:41,156 --> 00:14:43,789
Am l lying? Ask brother.

160
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:46,889
lt's the truth.
-Have you started talking too?

161
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:49,480
lt's the truth.

162
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,422
Goodbye, brother.

163
00:14:52,422 --> 00:14:56,478
Goodbye.

164
00:14:56,588 --> 00:15:03,785
Hang on guys... stop the train!

165
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:11,589
Seen your face in the mirror?
- Oh yes. This morning.

166
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:14,384
What attire is this?
You look like a joker!

167
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:23,455
We are going to Kashmir.

168
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:30,411
And who knows what destiny hold in store for us.

169
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,245
Go get me some water. l'm thirsty.

170
00:15:36,153 --> 00:15:36,620
Good Lord! l forgot to fill
water in the thermos flask.

171
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,847
You mean it's as empty as your head?

172
00:15:42,153 --> 00:15:42,920
Give it to me! l'll fill it at the railway station!

173
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,979
Make my bed!
- And bring me some milk.

174
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:56,587
Mr. Kalicharan...

175
00:15:56,587 --> 00:16:01,587
Mr. Somnath.
Give me some water.

176
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:03,387
ls Soonanagar the station's name?

177
00:16:03,387 --> 00:16:09,512
lt's indeed very 'Soona,(deserted)!
Hurry up! Quick!

178
00:16:09,786 --> 00:16:12,808
Quick!

179
00:16:14,586 --> 00:16:16,176
Have you filled it?
- Yes, l have, Sir.

180
00:16:21,652 --> 00:16:24,552
Hey, Chintu! You have already gone to sleep!

181
00:16:24,552 --> 00:16:28,711
Drink some water or you'll
have nightmares. Come on.

182
00:16:29,118 --> 00:16:30,084
Come on!

183
00:16:33,717 --> 00:16:37,085
Who are you?

184
00:16:37,085 --> 00:16:40,017
l think l have accidentally got
into the wrong compartment.

185
00:16:41,385 --> 00:16:42,485
You look like a thief to me!
.... Pull the chain!

186
00:16:42,485 --> 00:16:47,042
Look, please don't pull the chain
or the train will come to a halt.

187
00:16:47,485 --> 00:16:54,084
He'll throw me out of the train.
Please don't do this.

188
00:16:54,084 --> 00:16:55,379
lt's a ladies compartment. l will be
mortified. Please have some mercy!

189
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:00,683
Take a look at me.
ls this how a thief looks?

190
00:17:00,683 --> 00:17:02,817
lt's a thriving business nowadays
to get into a running train...

191
00:17:02,817 --> 00:17:05,850
and loot the jewelery of women!
Radha, quickly pull the chain!

192
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:09,416
Sapna, he does not
look like a thief.

193
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:10,749
That's what l'm saying.
- You shut up!

194
00:17:10,749 --> 00:17:14,273
Radha you don't know, the fool you.

195
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:17,947
Look, l am a decent college student.

196
00:17:18,649 --> 00:17:21,274
lt's unfortunate that l have to
hear all of you talk like this.

197
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:23,650
Have some mercy on me...
- Don't you dare!

198
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,048
Dont you dare! What are you trying to do?

199
00:17:28,216 --> 00:17:30,249
Dont you dare or l'll pull the chain.

200
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:33,579
Don't pull the chain! Look, l put my hands up.

201
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,382
You can embarrass me any other
way but please don't pull the chain.

202
00:17:36,715 --> 00:17:40,374
Look, robbers are worried
about embarrassment now.

203
00:17:40,682 --> 00:17:43,582
When he's getting beat up by police
officers, he'll see what he's done,

204
00:17:43,582 --> 00:17:47,843
Hands up!
-He probably messed with a girl too.

205
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:57,938
l will never get off at a station to get water again.

206
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,645
He looks so handsome in this pose!

207
00:18:14,514 --> 00:18:16,281
Here comes the station.
Now get down.

208
00:18:16,281 --> 00:18:19,247
We forgive you today.
But promise us...

209
00:18:19,481 --> 00:18:22,038
you will never ever board a
ladies compartment again!

210
00:18:22,281 --> 00:18:25,610
l will not. And l will never
forget your wonderful behavior!

211
00:18:25,847 --> 00:18:28,176
Thanks a lot for your hospitality.

212
00:18:28,447 --> 00:18:29,708
Goodbye, ladies.

213
00:18:32,013 --> 00:18:33,377
Let's go, water!

214
00:18:59,177 --> 00:19:00,839
Room No.209
- Thank-you.

215
00:19:01,379 --> 00:19:03,038
Go to Room No.209.

216
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:06,976
Chintu, after getting beaten,
come to Room No.209.

217
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,336
Okay.

218
00:19:13,044 --> 00:19:15,340
Which room will you be giving us?
- 206.

219
00:19:16,744 --> 00:19:19,108
Take the lady's baggage to Room No. 206.

220
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:22,699
Radha, carry on. l'll buy a film
magazine from the stall and come.

221
00:19:23,277 --> 00:19:24,140
Okay!

222
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:34,706
Not bad
Will you have some tea, Sir?

223
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:39,770
What l need now is some sleep. l,
ll send for you when l need you.

224
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:41,168
Okay!

225
00:20:05,942 --> 00:20:07,931
What's this! You've just arrived
and have already gone to sleep?!

226
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:11,738
Just look at what a lovely place this is!

227
00:20:12,141 --> 00:20:14,868
My word! Even the air here casts a spell!

228
00:20:15,874 --> 00:20:20,441
Wake up and get ready.
We'll go out then.

229
00:20:20,441 --> 00:20:23,032
The water must be hot.
l'll go and take a quick shower.

230
00:20:23,174 --> 00:20:27,663
And then you can take a bath, okay?
Hey! You're still not up!

231
00:20:31,373 --> 00:20:33,396
Will you wake up or should l hit you?

232
00:20:44,207 --> 00:20:48,367
l'm damned! l have entered a ladies room again!

233
00:20:57,072 --> 00:20:59,334
So this is what it's all about!

234
00:21:00,406 --> 00:21:01,769
l'll show her now!

235
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:15,235
Madam is having a shower?
How sweet!

236
00:21:32,105 --> 00:21:33,196
Radha, please give me your gown.

237
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:42,527
Give it to me soon!
Why are you harassing me?

238
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,497
Go on.

239
00:21:51,037 --> 00:21:54,400
What's this? Who does this huge gown belong to?

240
00:21:55,103 --> 00:21:57,001
Have you brought your father's gown?

241
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:07,926
You! You have come here too!
Where is Radha?

242
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:10,235
She isn't here.
- Vile man! l'll call the Manager!

243
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:12,967
Manager, help!
- Shut up!

244
00:22:19,702 --> 00:22:22,294
l'll hand you over to the police!
- What will you tell them?

245
00:22:22,569 --> 00:22:24,728
l'll say that a hoodlum
has barged into my room...

246
00:22:25,036 --> 00:22:26,003
and is trying to molest me!

247
00:22:26,003 --> 00:22:30,661
Before phoning the cops, see who has
actually entered another man's room.

248
00:22:30,935 --> 00:22:32,730
Meaning?
- Come here.

249
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:39,956
Look! This is Room No.209,
not 206! Understand?!

250
00:22:41,734 --> 00:22:45,757
Now l'll phone the cops and say
that a tramp barged into my room...

251
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:48,862
and tried to molest me.

252
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:53,666
Believe me, l came here thinking it was 206.

253
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:58,223
l had even read it. l don't know
how l was mistaken. l swear!

254
00:22:58,533 --> 00:23:02,727
The other day, even l swore, l had
come to your compartment accidentally.

255
00:23:03,065 --> 00:23:04,760
But none of you believed me!

256
00:23:05,368 --> 00:23:08,800
Today, l will also call my friends
and showthe state the lady is in.

257
00:23:09,101 --> 00:23:12,225
Perhaps, they will understand
what you are doing in my gown!

258
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:15,465
l implore you to let me go!

259
00:23:15,699 --> 00:23:20,098
Certainly not! First, call your
friends who had insulted me!

260
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:22,864
When they also apologize to me, l will let you go.

261
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:25,825
l will call them right away. l will
apologize to you in front of everyone.

262
00:23:26,466 --> 00:23:28,590
Hey! Don't soil my gown!

263
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:40,029
Yes...
What's the matter, Sapna?

264
00:23:41,198 --> 00:23:43,061
Okay, wait there.
l'll bring everyone.

265
00:23:46,164 --> 00:23:51,153
l request you not to mention
this to any of the boys.

266
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:55,023
lt's a question of my honor.
- l'll think.

267
00:23:55,365 --> 00:23:57,888
ls everything all right?
- What are you wearing?!

268
00:23:58,198 --> 00:24:00,231
Rascal! You have landed here too!

269
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:03,288
What are you doing with this rogue?
- This loafer must be sent to jail!

270
00:24:04,031 --> 00:24:09,224
Ask your friends to take back
their words and apologize to me!

271
00:24:09,631 --> 00:24:11,392
What's going on here?
- Shall l tell you?

272
00:24:18,296 --> 00:24:21,955
Listen.
- Yes?

273
00:24:22,263 --> 00:24:25,058
We have misunderstood you.
- Yes.

274
00:24:25,196 --> 00:24:27,718
Forgive us.
- Please forgive us.

275
00:24:28,062 --> 00:24:31,357
That's much better. Your clothes.
- Let's go, Sapna.

276
00:24:33,295 --> 00:24:38,193
Excuse me! Before returning my gown, do iron it.

277
00:24:38,494 --> 00:24:40,120
ln fact, wash it.

278
00:24:40,828 --> 00:24:43,455
You crook!
- Same to you!

279
00:24:58,595 --> 00:25:00,856
Help me!

280
00:25:01,728 --> 00:25:03,216
What happened?
-He'll kill me!

281
00:25:03,594 --> 00:25:05,428
Who will kill you?
-That lady's husband.

282
00:25:05,428 --> 00:25:08,825
Which girl?
-The one that l went mad over.

283
00:25:09,227 --> 00:25:10,886
The one with a birthmark on her cheek..

284
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,525
Where is he? l will kill him!

285
00:25:16,827 --> 00:25:19,349
He looked at my wife wrong.
l'll kill him.

286
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,484
Get him out!
-Calm down.

287
00:25:21,626 --> 00:25:24,320
l will tell you the truth.

288
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:26,648
l didn't come here to listen.. l
came here to kill him.

289
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:31,225
Why do you want to kill someone
who's basically already dead?

290
00:25:31,461 --> 00:25:32,017
What do you mean?

291
00:25:33,327 --> 00:25:36,315
This guy is crazy.

292
00:25:36,427 --> 00:25:40,291
Does your wife have a birthmark
on her cheek? -Yes. So?

293
00:25:40,593 --> 00:25:41,524
That's what l'm saying.

294
00:25:41,826 --> 00:25:44,724
4 or 5 years ago he was in love with a girl...

295
00:25:44,993 --> 00:25:48,118
...who had a birthmark on her cheek and
she had an affair with someone else.

296
00:25:48,426 --> 00:25:50,052
He's been depressed ever since.

297
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:55,689
He goes crazy when he sees a
woman with a birthmark on her cheek.

298
00:25:56,259 --> 00:25:58,588
So he's crazy.

299
00:26:09,991 --> 00:26:15,685
Listen to the news...the price for one
glass of milk is 1 rupee per foot.

300
00:26:16,023 --> 00:26:17,955
Achaar is 2 rupees per yard.

301
00:26:18,056 --> 00:26:21,149
Mangoes from Bombay are 10 rupees per bundle.

302
00:26:24,892 --> 00:26:28,380
Hello!

303
00:26:28,691 --> 00:26:33,055
Chintu...
-Why don't you lock him up?

304
00:26:33,323 --> 00:26:34,812
He's not dangerous.

305
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:37,891
He just goes crazy when he sees a
woman with a birthmark on her cheek.

306
00:26:37,891 --> 00:26:40,254
Otherwise he's a good boy.

307
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:51,183
l beg you to keep you wife's
birthmark hidden while you hear.

308
00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:53,515
Take care of him.
-Yes l will.

309
00:26:56,989 --> 00:27:00,648
Thank God he's gone! What will
become of my National lntegration?

310
00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:03,612
Your National lntegration?
l'll shoot you myself.

311
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:05,184
Take it off!

312
00:27:09,656 --> 00:27:11,122
You go ahead. l'll come in a minute.

313
00:27:11,122 --> 00:27:13,247
Where are you going?
-Just one minute.

314
00:27:13,855 --> 00:27:15,684
This is not what you think it is.

315
00:27:15,922 --> 00:27:19,285
What is it?
-lt's a bar where people get drunk.

316
00:27:19,855 --> 00:27:21,252
Bar?
-Yes.

317
00:27:21,522 --> 00:27:23,511
Show me a bar for once.

318
00:27:23,855 --> 00:27:24,785
Let's go!

319
00:27:30,354 --> 00:27:30,683
What a bar!

320
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,753
Don't look there or you'll invite trouble.

321
00:27:37,753 --> 00:27:41,480
Where? At the man with the pistol?

322
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,153
What are you doing!

323
00:27:44,153 --> 00:27:45,676
l don't want him to see the beauty spot.

324
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:57,178
See? You did a great thing
by hiding that beauty spot.

325
00:27:57,454 --> 00:27:59,579
Let the beauty spot remain this way now.

326
00:28:04,887 --> 00:28:09,410
Hey, you! Give me a sweet smile!
- Here you are!

327
00:28:12,652 --> 00:28:14,584
Okay, my turn now.

328
00:28:17,185 --> 00:28:20,345
Wait... l want the bhangra pose.
- Look here.

329
00:28:20,885 --> 00:28:22,351
Okay.

00:28:22,652 --> 00:28:25,845
All right.
Am l looking handsome?

331
00:28:27,085 --> 00:28:30,346
Hey, Chintu! You are damned!

332
00:28:30,651 --> 00:28:36,083
Oh? Do l photograph badly?
- No! Look there. lt's the same girl.

333
00:28:36,517 --> 00:28:39,278
Which one?... There are many here.

334
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:41,742
Fool! The one who is having her picture clicked.

335
00:28:58,351 --> 00:29:02,215
(Song sung by male)"The red
wand that stands its ground..."

336
00:29:03,183 --> 00:29:07,479
"the fight it put up"

337
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:12,140
"l lost my heart"

338
00:29:12,983 --> 00:29:16,642
"l lost my life"

339
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:21,140
"l eyes met hers, and our love story started"

340
00:29:21,516 --> 00:29:23,815
"The red wand that stands its ground..."

341
00:29:23,815 --> 00:29:27,303
"and the fight it put up"

342
00:29:27,581 --> 00:29:30,411
"l lost my heart;
l lost my life"

343
00:29:30,747 --> 00:29:33,736
"Our eyes met, and our love story started"

344
00:29:34,216 --> 00:29:36,909
"The red wand that stands its ground..."

345
00:29:53,814 --> 00:29:59,940
"Those piercing eyes
l had to look into..."

346
00:30:00,213 --> 00:30:03,202
"a calamity l had to invite"

347
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,968
"catastrophe itself l had to clash with"

348
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:16,239
"Those piercing eyes
l had to look into..."

349
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:19,409
"a calamity l had to invite"

350
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:22,975
"Catastrophe itself
l had to clash with"

351
00:30:23,114 --> 00:30:26,204
"Do not even ask what l have been through..."

352
00:30:26,514 --> 00:30:29,604
"lightning struck my heart"

353
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:35,906
"l lost my heart;
l lost my life..."

354
00:30:36,212 --> 00:30:39,178
"Our eyes met and our love story started"

355
00:30:39,613 --> 00:30:43,067
"The red wand that stands its ground"

356
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:11,474
"Why did it occur to me to walk
into her menacing company..."

357
00:31:11,944 --> 00:31:18,467
"her words were far more
lethal than the bullet"

358
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:27,531
"Why did it occur to me to
walk into her company..."

359
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:33,902
"her words were far more
lethal than the bullet"

360
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,076
"What will happen now...?"

361
00:31:36,076 --> 00:31:40,405
"every moment l spend is a difficult moment"

362
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:42,942
"l've lost my heart"

363
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:46,772
"l've lost my heart;
l've lost my life..."

364
00:31:47,075 --> 00:31:49,308
"our eyes met and our love story started"

365
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:53,603
"The red wand that stands its ground"

366
00:32:09,308 --> 00:32:15,706
"Every arrow of hers found its mark"

367
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:22,100
"Thanks a million, Lord...
l'm wounded at heart, but alive"

368
00:32:25,274 --> 00:32:31,467
"Every arrow of hers found its mark"

369
00:32:31,873 --> 00:32:37,828
"Thanks a million, Lord...
l'm wounded at heart, but alive"

370
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:44,331
"She carries a dupatta so red...
l call her the Red Wand"

371
00:32:44,572 --> 00:32:47,299
"l've lost my heart..."

00:32:47,705 --> 00:32:49,241
"l've lost my heart,

374
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:55,902
"The red wand that stands its ground"

375
00:33:09,339 --> 00:33:13,998
He'll remember it all his life.
- We treated him badly too.

376
00:33:14,972 --> 00:33:18,369
But, Radha, he won the last round.
l'm burning from within!

377
00:33:18,671 --> 00:33:19,829
Forget him!

378
00:33:20,338 --> 00:33:23,792
Let's go and practice on the tennis
court for the match tomorrow morning.

379
00:33:24,104 --> 00:33:25,592
Okay. l'll comb my hair and come.

380
00:33:48,203 --> 00:33:48,704
l've been keeping an eye on you, my boy.

381
00:33:48,704 --> 00:33:53,329
lf you look at her again,
l'll hit you myself, understand?

382
00:33:54,504 --> 00:33:56,765
l heard that the maiden is from Lucknow.

383
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,292
And l will send you to Kanyakumari!

384
00:34:33,368 --> 00:34:34,800
Wow, that was fantastic!

385
00:34:34,935 --> 00:34:36,833
You devastated her game.
- Thank you.

386
00:34:37,568 --> 00:34:41,701
Congratulations! Believe me, l've
never seen this kind of tennis!

387
00:34:41,701 --> 00:34:43,724
The game was thoroughly enjoyable!
- Really?

388
00:34:44,201 --> 00:34:47,098
Now, you win the trophy. Only then
will there be glory to our college.

389
00:34:47,467 --> 00:34:48,932
With your best wishes,
l will even win the Davis Cup!

390
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:52,962
ls that all? With your best wishes,
l could land on the moon!

391
00:34:53,267 --> 00:34:55,596
Shut up!
- You could've said that with a smile.

392
00:34:55,867 --> 00:34:57,560
lt's a holiday tomorrow.

393
00:34:57,933 --> 00:35:00,296
So the final match will be
held the day after tomorrow.

394
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,057
Listen to me? Are you mad at me?

395
00:35:09,665 --> 00:35:12,529
Listen, will it hurt you if
l say something?

396
00:35:12,998 --> 00:35:18,626
l've decided that if l love
someone, he will be from U,P.

397
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,356
Ya?
-Yes.

398
00:35:22,066 --> 00:35:26,021
The fact is, my culture is very important to me.

399
00:35:26,266 --> 00:35:30,391
Our way of living and our language
is more important than life itself.

400
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:36,956
Why? You don't believe me?

401
00:35:37,232 --> 00:35:40,629
lt's not that. l have a request for you.

402
00:35:40,965 --> 00:35:45,021
l am from Lucknowtoo, for your information.

403
00:35:45,364 --> 00:35:47,989
l send you greetings.

404
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:54,123
Really? But you look crazy
because of the way you dress.

405
00:35:56,597 --> 00:36:00,188
The reason for that is l had
an accident in the past.

406
00:36:00,629 --> 00:36:04,393
l can't even tell you how bad it was.

407
00:36:04,765 --> 00:36:07,992
Then?
-Then the person that gave me blood...

408
00:36:08,231 --> 00:36:13,891
...he was a Punjabi and
that's why l write in Punjabi.

409
00:36:14,231 --> 00:36:14,964
Hello.

410
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,896
Where did you live in Lucknow?

411
00:36:18,063 --> 00:36:21,052
By the sea.
-Sea in Lucknow?

412
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:25,025
l mean by the "Sea Hotel."

413
00:36:25,396 --> 00:36:27,589
lt must be a new hotel.

414
00:36:34,895 --> 00:36:38,020
A small present for you.

415
00:36:46,361 --> 00:36:47,826
Your funny.

416
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,992
So you turned out to be from U.P.

417
00:36:54,895 --> 00:36:57,225
Will you recite a poem for me?

418
00:36:57,561 --> 00:37:00,550
Lion? Please don't mention that name.

419
00:37:00,828 --> 00:37:01,794
My heart starts to beat really fast.

420
00:37:03,161 --> 00:37:05,252
l was talking about poetry.

421
00:37:05,961 --> 00:37:07,291
You must remember Galib Sahib.

422
00:37:07,627 --> 00:37:11,923
l do. l remember Galib and Ghulam.

423
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,692
They used to go to school with me.

424
00:37:16,694 --> 00:37:20,557
And Galib was the best at cricket.

425
00:37:20,893 --> 00:37:24,791
Cricket? What are you talking about?

426
00:37:25,192 --> 00:37:27,259
l'm talking about Hassib Galib.

427
00:37:27,259 --> 00:37:29,657
There's not a better poet than him.

428
00:37:31,493 --> 00:37:34,981
Hassib Galib? l give him props.

429
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:37,620
He is fabulous.

430
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:42,316
l have never heard of
another person named Galib.

431
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,693
l can name you three people.

432
00:37:47,693 --> 00:37:52,182
First, your Hassib Galib. Second, my friend Galib.

433
00:37:52,526 --> 00:37:55,616
What?
-My cricketer friend, Galib.

434
00:37:55,925 --> 00:37:59,085
And the third...
-Don't say the third was a tennis player.

435
00:38:01,291 --> 00:38:04,314
That reminds me l must get back.
My friend will kill me.

436
00:38:10,691 --> 00:38:13,391
Mr. Sunder, greetings!

437
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:17,221
Don't start that nonsense...
l'm writing a letter to father.

438
00:38:17,723 --> 00:38:21,553
Gentleman, just take a look here.

439
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:32,248
Wow, Chintu! You look just like the
blue-blooded Lucknowi Nawab!

440
00:38:32,591 --> 00:38:35,580
Which means, you now have
your eyes on Lucknow?

441
00:38:35,957 --> 00:38:38,219
But beware.

442
00:38:38,491 --> 00:38:42,253
Someone may come with a knife and stab you!

443
00:38:43,423 --> 00:38:50,185
Now, l fear no foe!
- What did you say?!

444
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:54,115
Hey! l said, l fear no foe!

445
00:38:54,389 --> 00:38:57,355
What does that mean?
- l fear no enemy!

446
00:38:57,689 --> 00:39:02,018
Because my beloved is yet
single and captivated in my love!

447
00:39:02,222 --> 00:39:06,244
Yes, indeed!
- You're right.

448
00:39:31,321 --> 00:39:33,651
Radha, Let's go sit in that old man's boat.

449
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,679
The one with a beard?
-Yes. Let's go.

450
00:39:39,453 --> 00:39:42,613
How much will you charge for an hour?

451
00:39:44,286 --> 00:39:49,741
What's me age? l'm about 78 years old.

452
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:52,382
l didn't ask for your age.

453
00:39:52,819 --> 00:39:54,819
He seems absolutely deaf.

454
00:39:54,819 --> 00:39:57,046
Children? l have 13.

455
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:05,648
Rupees? Give me whatever you want.

456
00:40:05,952 --> 00:40:08,545
Let's go.
-Sit.

457
00:40:18,419 --> 00:40:19,985
They seem funny.

458
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:25,008
My name is not funny, it's Subatgeen.

459
00:40:25,284 --> 00:40:29,148
l wasn't talking about your name.
l was talking about your funny behavior.

460
00:40:29,618 --> 00:40:35,607
Who doesn't become funny
with beautiful woman like you.

461
00:40:36,751 --> 00:40:39,384
l was just saying you were funny..

462
00:40:39,384 --> 00:40:41,975
...but you turned out to be a romantic also.

463
00:40:42,217 --> 00:40:45,377
l've always been a romantic type of guy.

464
00:40:46,183 --> 00:40:51,740
l used to recite poems to my third girlfriend.

465
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:57,778
And then thereis my son who
doesn't like poetry at all.

466
00:40:58,051 --> 00:41:02,676
Hey! l mean my darling father.

467
00:41:02,983 --> 00:41:06,642
Watch what you say or else...

468
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:10,407
Look, you don't argue with your father.

469
00:41:10,649 --> 00:41:12,081
Let us hear a poem from him.

470
00:41:12,349 --> 00:41:14,679
l will recite it.

471
00:41:14,915 --> 00:41:16,847
But you have to answer also.

472
00:41:21,382 --> 00:41:25,648
l remembered you deep in me heart...

473
00:41:25,648 --> 00:41:30,171
... like a flower blossoming in the spring.

474
00:41:31,115 --> 00:41:32,444
Wonderful!

475
00:41:34,247 --> 00:41:37,645
Like clouds move calmly through the sky...

476
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,571
... like a sick person gains a miracle.

477
00:41:55,181 --> 00:42:01,238
Your name is coming to my mind..

478
00:42:01,748 --> 00:42:08,839
.. like your fragrance flows to me.

479
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:17,335
When l think of you, the morning seems beautiful.

480
00:42:17,912 --> 00:42:22,310
Whenever l feel your sadness, l feel restless.

481
00:42:31,011 --> 00:42:35,138
l don't know what hope l'm living on.

482
00:42:36,879 --> 00:42:40,743
l don't know what hope l'm living on.

483
00:42:41,179 --> 00:42:45,235
l'm going on a road where your no where in sight.

484
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:57,142
Your youth is showing.

485
00:42:58,311 --> 00:43:02,038
Say something.
-Let me have your book.

486
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:04,703
That means that now you want to read the book.

487
00:43:04,977 --> 00:43:07,067
Go ahead and read.

488
00:43:17,876 --> 00:43:21,205
Go and put another beard on buddy.

489
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:33,643
The water is very cold.

490
00:43:33,643 --> 00:43:35,574
l don't know howto swim!

491
00:43:40,275 --> 00:43:47,197
The contest will be between Sunder
Srivastav and Devendrapratap.

492
00:43:47,508 --> 00:43:50,236
Mr. Sunder Srivastav, come to the ground!

493
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:52,475
Where is Sunder?

494
00:43:52,475 --> 00:43:55,998
l think he must've fled out of fear.

495
00:43:56,475 --> 00:43:58,375
l don't think he would flee out of fear.

496
00:43:58,375 --> 00:44:02,171
He could very well be talking
to a beautiful girl right now.

497
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:06,600
Chanda, there's a bed-bug annoying
me! lt's been after me since long!

498
00:44:07,006 --> 00:44:09,495
So haughty?
- l am not talking to you.

499
00:44:09,806 --> 00:44:12,075
Do your work.
- That's what l'm going to do.

500
00:44:12,075 --> 00:44:15,837
With your good wishes...
The name is Sunder Srivastav.

501
00:45:14,038 --> 00:45:16,197
You will be pleased to hear that...

502
00:45:16,538 --> 00:45:21,595
the Championship Cup will be given
to Mumbai's Sunder Srivastav.

503
00:45:24,404 --> 00:45:27,165
My victory must have surely
made you feel unhappy.

504
00:45:27,637 --> 00:45:29,296
At least, put on a charade and congratulate me!

505
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:32,264
This bed-bug has begun harassing me again!

506
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:42,264
Damn! l am fed up with Sunder!

507
00:45:42,569 --> 00:45:45,136
For the first time today, l haven't
seen his miserable face!

508
00:45:45,136 --> 00:45:47,795
The fool has been pursuing me like a devil!

509
00:45:48,738 --> 00:45:52,500
The devil never stops pursuing!
... but the man is not bad.

510
00:46:08,103 --> 00:46:11,364
Sapna, why are these bottles floating here?

511
00:46:13,168 --> 00:46:14,099
Come comes another.

512
00:46:23,834 --> 00:46:24,562
There's something in this.

513
00:46:41,568 --> 00:46:43,397
This is for you.

514
00:46:43,701 --> 00:46:45,223
For me?!
- Yes.

515
00:46:48,201 --> 00:46:49,462
"Sapna, l love you"

516
00:46:50,667 --> 00:46:53,292
What does it say?
- Your head!

517
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:01,226
Sunder's pining for you.
- Hush! You'll drive the fish away.

518
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:07,657
Hey! l've caught a fish!
Looks like a big one! Hurry up!

519
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:17,054
You!
- Hello.

520
00:47:17,865 --> 00:47:21,853
l was floating in the water and l took your bait.

521
00:47:22,331 --> 00:47:26,697
Now, you may either fry this fish or roast it.

522
00:47:27,033 --> 00:47:31,566
But do give me some coffee...
l'm feeling terribly cold!

523
00:47:31,566 --> 00:47:33,895
l am freezing to death.

524
00:47:34,299 --> 00:47:37,560
l'll wrap a blanket.
Please give me a cup of coffee.

525
00:47:38,065 --> 00:47:43,224
Mustn't l give you poison instead?
- l ask, why do you hate me so much?

526
00:47:43,964 --> 00:47:47,726
l love you. l want to marry you.

527
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:50,290
l come from a respectable family.

528
00:47:50,597 --> 00:47:53,028
l am a good student as well as a tennis champion.

529
00:47:53,364 --> 00:47:56,761
l can do everything for you,... even stake my life.

530
00:47:57,097 --> 00:47:59,256
Really?
- Try me out.

531
00:47:59,563 --> 00:48:01,154
Then go drown yourself.

532
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:08,123
l will. But think it over.
You will cry for me!

533
00:48:08,496 --> 00:48:10,791
We'll see about that.
- Think again.

534
00:48:11,196 --> 00:48:14,491
l repeat, for the last time.
- Yes! l have thought about it!

535
00:48:15,364 --> 00:48:17,852
Really? Good bye!

536
00:48:19,996 --> 00:48:24,690
You girls are my witnesses!
She's responsible for my death!

537
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:29,957
Bye, everybody!

538
00:48:33,062 --> 00:48:37,289
Sapna, l love you!

539
00:48:40,861 --> 00:48:42,259
What a romantic guy!

540
00:48:42,595 --> 00:48:44,928
Let's see how long he
remains in that freezing water.

541
00:48:44,928 --> 00:48:46,587
He'll be out in a minute.

542
00:48:49,861 --> 00:48:51,486
A minute's over.

543
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,551
He has still not come out.

544
00:48:58,493 --> 00:49:00,186
You have killed the poor man!

545
00:49:01,126 --> 00:49:03,115
You are responsible for Sunder's death.

546
00:49:03,293 --> 00:49:05,557
Who do you think you are?

547
00:49:06,028 --> 00:49:09,357
Are you so arrogant that you
will play with people's lives!

548
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:14,817
ls it a crime to love?
- But l never wanted him to drown!

549
00:49:15,394 --> 00:49:18,951
How was l to knowthat he would
indeed get drown and die?

550
00:49:33,059 --> 00:49:35,892
"There's no one quite like you, my love"

551
00:49:35,892 --> 00:49:39,380
"Let me tell you this much..."

552
00:49:39,725 --> 00:49:45,851
"l belong to you, my love...
just get to know me better"

553
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:49,224
"There's no one quite
like you, my love"

554
00:49:49,224 --> 00:49:52,749
"Let me tell you this much..."

555
00:49:52,992 --> 00:49:59,413
"l belong to you, my love...
just get to know me better"

556
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:32,253
"Like the breeze that blows...
l will walk with you"

557
00:50:32,556 --> 00:50:35,579
"Ever since l've fallen in love with you..."

558
00:50:35,788 --> 00:50:39,618
"l've been meeting you and l always will"

559
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:47,321
"Like the breeze that blows...
l will walk with you"

560
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:50,646
"Ever since l've fallen in love with you..."

561
00:50:50,989 --> 00:50:53,819
"l've been meeting you and l always will"

562
00:50:55,756 --> 00:51:00,847
"You are the very best"

563
00:51:01,155 --> 00:51:04,121
"Let me tell you this much, my love..."

564
00:51:04,421 --> 00:51:08,853
"l belong to you, my love...
just get to know me better"

565
00:51:10,787 --> 00:51:13,810
"You are the very best, my love"

566
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,585
"Let me tell you this much, my love"

567
00:51:17,487 --> 00:51:22,181
"l belong to you... just get to know me better"

568
00:51:49,886 --> 00:51:53,113
"l have a heart in which you live..."

569
00:51:53,386 --> 00:51:54,908
"ln you, is my life"

570
00:51:56,585 --> 00:51:59,676
"May you always be happy"

571
00:51:59,985 --> 00:52:01,541
"lt's because of you that l live"

572
00:52:04,785 --> 00:52:07,750
"l have a heart in which you live"

573
00:52:08,051 --> 00:52:11,108
"ln you is my life"

574
00:52:11,417 --> 00:52:14,349
"May you always be happy"

575
00:52:14,617 --> 00:52:17,606
"lt's because of you that l live"

576
00:52:21,418 --> 00:52:24,350
"You are the very best, my love"

577
00:52:24,685 --> 00:52:27,742
"Let me tell you this much, my love"

578
00:52:28,118 --> 00:52:34,051
"l belong to you... just get to know me better"

579
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:37,406
"There's no one quite
like you, my love"

580
00:52:37,818 --> 00:52:40,648
"But let me tell you this much"

581
00:52:40,983 --> 00:52:47,211
"l belong to you, my love...
just get to know me better"

582
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:16,214
"l tried to die... but l couldn't"

583
00:53:16,516 --> 00:53:19,675
"My love saved me"

584
00:53:19,982 --> 00:53:27,005
"lt is perhaps the magic of your
love that brought me back to life"

585
00:53:27,848 --> 00:53:31,008
"l tried to die... but l couldn't"

586
00:53:31,348 --> 00:53:34,439
"My love saved me"

587
00:53:34,581 --> 00:53:40,706
"lt is perhaps the magic of your
love that brought me back to life"

588
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:47,613
"You are the very best, my love"

589
00:53:47,613 --> 00:53:51,101
"Let me tell you this much..."

590
00:53:51,413 --> 00:53:57,404
"l belong to you, my love...
just get to know me better"

591
00:53:57,815 --> 00:54:00,871
"You are the very best my love"

592
00:54:01,047 --> 00:54:04,207
"Let me tell you this much..."

593
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:11,174
"l belong to you, my love...
just get to know me better"

594
00:54:33,345 --> 00:54:35,311
Sorry to disturb you.

595
00:54:35,944 --> 00:54:37,500
Not at all, Manager.
Please sit down.

596
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:42,838
We're starting a hostel for
poor students in Srinagar.

597
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:45,837
That's a very noble idea.
- To raise funds...

598
00:54:46,412 --> 00:54:49,139
we're holding a special program.

599
00:54:49,611 --> 00:54:54,043
lt is my request, if you could present an item...

600
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:57,177
it would be a major draw.
- We are also students...

601
00:54:57,478 --> 00:54:59,739
and are willing to do anything for their good.

602
00:55:00,011 --> 00:55:01,477
Why don't you do a dance program with Sapna?

603
00:55:01,477 --> 00:55:04,443
She's a wonderful dancer.
- That's a very good idea.

604
00:55:05,944 --> 00:55:08,510
But you knowthat she even hates the sight of me.

605
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:11,237
l think she will agree for such a noble cause.

606
00:55:11,576 --> 00:55:13,976
l will personally go and speak to her.

607
00:55:13,976 --> 00:55:16,441
Come with me.
Let's go and convince her.

608
00:55:19,409 --> 00:55:22,772
Now have your cake and eat it too!

609
00:55:23,142 --> 00:55:28,039
Do something noble.
And also romance with Sapna!

610
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:31,269
Please come here, Mr. Sunder.

611
00:55:31,608 --> 00:55:34,337
Didn't l tell you that she would
never refuse such a noble cause?

612
00:55:36,343 --> 00:55:38,309
For the dance,...

613
00:55:38,643 --> 00:55:42,632
Yes. We have taped some
good music for this program.

614
00:55:43,009 --> 00:55:45,668
l'll send the tape recorder.
You can start the rehearsals.

615
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:46,968
Thank you!

616
00:55:48,942 --> 00:55:53,067
Thanks for agreeing for the dance.
When do we start rehearsals?

617
00:55:53,608 --> 00:55:56,903
l agreed to do the program; not the rehearsal!

618
00:55:57,241 --> 00:55:57,968
Do your rehearsal separately. l'll
dance with you only during the show.

619
00:56:34,373 --> 00:56:36,998
What are you doing here!
- What's the matter, Chintu?

620
00:56:37,306 --> 00:56:38,636
When will you be coming for the rehearsal?

621
00:56:38,939 --> 00:56:42,962
l have told a million times that
l will not rehearse with your friend!

622
00:56:43,373 --> 00:56:46,439
Don't say that! lt'll ruin the show.
People will beat us up!

623
00:56:46,439 --> 00:56:49,496
What can l do? My part is in the tape recorder...

624
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:51,532
ask him to hear it and rehearse!

625
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:54,702
Sapna, l think you should have
a final rehearsal with Sunder.

626
00:56:55,205 --> 00:56:56,966
He won't eat you up!
- Shut up!

627
00:56:57,471 --> 00:57:00,104
Why did you ask my friend
to shut up? You shut up!

628
00:57:00,104 --> 00:57:02,195
You asked my Chintu to shut up!

629
00:57:02,571 --> 00:57:04,695
You shut up!
- You shut up!

630
00:57:07,037 --> 00:57:10,491
Beautiful! Lovely!

631
00:57:32,904 --> 00:57:36,427
My spectacles have broken.
... just a minute. Ceasefire!

632
00:57:36,704 --> 00:57:39,437
l only came to ask if you would
rehearse with Sunder or not.

633
00:57:39,437 --> 00:57:43,334
No! l will never do a final
rehearsal with your friend!

634
00:57:43,703 --> 00:57:46,169
Send the tape recorder here.
l want to rehearse it here!

635
00:57:46,169 --> 00:57:49,158
The show will flop if you refuse!
We'll get beaten up!

636
00:57:49,336 --> 00:57:51,063
Shut up!
- You ask me to shut up?

637
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:56,734
Get out from here!
- l'll report it to Sunder! l will!

638
00:58:04,636 --> 00:58:07,235
Sunder, l don't think this show will take place!

639
00:58:07,235 --> 00:58:11,327
She's not even willing to rehearse
with us. Who does she think she is?

640
00:58:11,702 --> 00:58:14,759
Whatever she thinks of herself is not enough.

641
00:58:15,102 --> 00:58:18,898
Have you seen another girl
like her in this world?

642
00:58:19,368 --> 00:58:22,163
Chintu, l love her.

643
00:58:22,468 --> 00:58:25,627
Hey Romeo, you will get ruined in her love!

644
00:58:25,967 --> 00:58:29,490
Whatever happens...
l love her.

645
00:58:29,834 --> 00:58:34,357
But she won't encourage you!
So think about the show!

646
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:38,266
We might get beaten up.
- Don't worry about the show, Chintu.

647
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:43,655
l have rehearsed my part.
... l love her!

648
00:58:43,965 --> 00:58:45,726
Madam is even asking for the tape recorder.

649
00:58:46,032 --> 00:58:48,864
What? She's asking for the tape recorder?

650
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:53,955
l'll return it in half an hour.
l promise... and you know, l...

651
00:58:54,233 --> 00:58:57,222
Enough! You will say, "l love her"
- Yes!

652
00:58:58,367 --> 00:59:04,299
l love her... l love her!

653
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:08,325
Let's go and eat. We've got to wake
up early for the showtomorrow.

654
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:10,230
Come in.

655
00:59:13,398 --> 00:59:16,694
Madam, the gentleman from 209 has sent this.

656
00:59:16,998 --> 00:59:18,328
Keep it on that table.

657
00:59:22,031 --> 00:59:24,190
Radha, you go and eat.

658
00:59:24,597 --> 00:59:25,563
Won't you eat?

659
00:59:26,964 --> 00:59:31,191
No, l'll skip it. l had a lot to eat with tea.

660
00:59:31,497 --> 00:59:34,758
The tape recorder is also
here, so let me rehearse.

661
00:59:35,663 --> 00:59:37,151
Okay, l'll leave then.

662
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:58,885
Hello, Sapna... surprised to
hear my voice, aren't you?

663
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:04,918
Yes, my voice comes from the tape recorder.

664
01:00:05,263 --> 01:00:10,320
Please sit for a while.
l want to tell you something.

665
01:00:11,829 --> 01:00:15,090
Sapna, l love you from the depths of my heart.

666
01:00:15,662 --> 01:00:18,329
Do you know where the beads of sweat
on your forehead have appeared from...

667
01:00:18,329 --> 01:00:20,385
even in this chilly weather?

668
01:00:21,062 --> 01:00:25,858
This is nothing but the burning flame of my love!

669
01:00:26,496 --> 01:00:29,485
What have you done?
You have wiped your forehead?

670
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:32,159
You look even more beautiful.

671
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:35,586
Are you going to pick up a glass of water?

672
01:00:37,362 --> 01:00:41,021
This will not douse the fires which
my love has sparked in your heart.

673
01:00:41,661 --> 01:00:43,422
You have choked on it, haven't you?

674
01:00:43,728 --> 01:00:47,023
Put the glass down.
Come and relax on the chair.

675
01:00:47,328 --> 01:00:48,918
l will then tell you.

676
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,817
l fell in love with you the same night...

677
01:00:55,161 --> 01:00:57,490
when l had accidentally
entered your compartment.

678
01:00:57,694 --> 01:01:00,887
Looking back, l find that to
be such a beautiful mistake.

679
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:03,226
How long will you go on wrapping
your veil around your finger?

680
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:05,392
That's better.
After reaching Kashmir,...

681
01:01:05,392 --> 01:01:08,688
l tried to get close to you every time.

682
01:01:08,993 --> 01:01:10,322
To win over your smile.

683
01:01:10,626 --> 01:01:11,614
But each time, l kept committing a blunder...

684
01:01:12,825 --> 01:01:16,782
which only distanced you from me.
Won't you forgive me?

685
01:01:17,061 --> 01:01:19,593
Yuk! Why are you biting your nails?!

686
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:22,787
lt's a bad habit and l strongly disapprove of it.

687
01:01:23,126 --> 01:01:26,785
Why are you staring that way? Don't
l even have that much right over you?

688
01:01:27,226 --> 01:01:30,851
That's it! By God's grace,
l hope you keep smiling like this.

689
01:01:31,225 --> 01:01:35,782
lf l've made a place in your heart,
then the phone is in front of you.

690
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:38,116
Just say hello to me.

691
01:01:39,059 --> 01:01:44,491
l eagerly await near my telephone
to hear your sweet voice.

692
01:01:44,725 --> 01:01:46,020
Sapna, l love you.

693
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:07,388
Stop waiting!
Nobody will come here now!

694
01:02:07,692 --> 01:02:10,556
Switch off the lights and let me
sleep. And you go to sleep, too!

695
01:02:11,525 --> 01:02:12,581
Crazy man!

696
01:02:26,356 --> 01:02:30,254
"Have you seen that forehead?
That face, those lips...?"

697
01:02:30,922 --> 01:02:34,684
"in whose thoughts
l have spent my life?"

698
01:02:50,788 --> 01:02:53,779
Sunder has said that he will not
dance with you for the show.

699
01:02:54,756 --> 01:02:56,880
So that is how it is?

700
01:02:57,622 --> 01:02:59,986
This show will take place, without him!

701
01:03:00,289 --> 01:03:01,879
l'll change the dance program!

702
01:03:02,188 --> 01:03:06,280
Ask him to just sit at home!
l don't need him! Understand?

703
01:04:23,216 --> 01:04:30,385
"Sing with me... a song so beautiful"

704
01:04:30,385 --> 01:04:39,044
Sing with me... a song so beautiful"

705
01:04:39,251 --> 01:04:43,512
Sing with me...

706
01:05:15,814 --> 01:05:20,145
"l belong to you... so does my heart"

707
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:22,312
"l belong to you..."

708
01:05:23,582 --> 01:05:27,479
"l belong to you... so does my heart"

709
01:05:27,748 --> 01:05:30,015
"We have been companions for ages"

710
01:05:30,015 --> 01:05:35,470
"We have been together for ages"

711
01:05:36,148 --> 01:05:43,342
"At your feet l lay my head in worship..."

712
01:05:45,681 --> 01:05:49,980
"Sing with me..."

713
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:56,845
"a song so beautiful, sing with me"

714
01:05:56,845 --> 01:06:07,144
"A song so beautiful... sing with me"

715
01:06:26,879 --> 01:06:29,344
"ln a heart so fragile,
l cherish your face..."

716
01:06:31,378 --> 01:06:38,401
"ln a heart so fragile,
l cherish your face"

717
01:06:38,711 --> 01:06:42,268
"lt's you l see day in and day out"

718
01:06:42,611 --> 01:06:46,441
"lt's you l see day in and day out"

719
01:06:46,777 --> 01:06:55,800
"You are the God of my love"

720
01:06:56,178 --> 01:07:03,177
"Sing with me... a song so beautiful"

721
01:07:03,177 --> 01:07:11,405
"Sing with me... a song so beautiful"

722
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:16,065
"Sing with me..."

723
01:07:47,709 --> 01:07:51,266
"At first sight,
l took you for my own"

724
01:07:51,908 --> 01:07:53,737
"At first sight..."

725
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:59,136
"At first sight,
l took you for my own"

726
01:07:59,441 --> 01:08:02,641
"You taught me to
lead a life of love"

727
01:08:02,641 --> 01:08:07,198
"You taught me to
lead a life of love"

728
01:08:07,573 --> 01:08:16,006
"Oh beloved, many thanks to you"

729
01:08:16,006 --> 01:08:24,870
"Sing with me... a song so beautiful"

730
01:08:25,172 --> 01:08:32,696
Sing with me... a song so beautiful"

731
01:08:33,005 --> 01:08:40,064
"Sing with me..."

732
01:08:55,672 --> 01:08:59,468
The credit for the success of
today's show goes entirely to you.

733
01:08:59,837 --> 01:09:01,928
l went crazy over your dance!

734
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:05,793
Did you really like it that much?
- You were splendid! lt was superb!

735
01:09:06,604 --> 01:09:10,865
But the fun of doing a new show with
Sunder would've been something else.

736
01:09:11,203 --> 01:09:12,998
But Sunder is not to be blamed for this.

737
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:16,767
Had you rehearsed with him, he,d
have never refused to dance with you.

738
01:09:17,170 --> 01:09:18,658
Thank you, Radha.

739
01:09:20,503 --> 01:09:23,271
l am feeling a bit stifled in this room.

740
01:09:23,271 --> 01:09:27,498
lt's too small for three people.
So l had better leave.

741
01:09:28,071 --> 01:09:30,400
Where are you going, Radha?
l'm coming, too.

742
01:09:32,337 --> 01:09:34,996
Before leaving, tell me, why
didn't you phone me last night?

743
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:39,202
When did you ask me to phone you?

744
01:09:39,569 --> 01:09:42,694
You mean, you didn't use the
tape-recorder to rehearse last night?

745
01:09:43,136 --> 01:09:45,727
Last night?
- Yes, last night!

746
01:09:46,102 --> 01:09:49,534
l was very tired last night, so l did not rehearse.

747
01:09:49,902 --> 01:09:51,868
The tape recorder was just lying here.

748
01:09:54,602 --> 01:09:58,966
You should have rehearsed.
- Why? Didn't l dance well?

749
01:09:59,268 --> 01:10:01,961
No! That's not the case.
- So what is it?

750
01:10:02,501 --> 01:10:06,661
l mean, you certainly should
have played the tape recorder.

751
01:10:07,067 --> 01:10:10,329
Why? Was it anything special?
- Yes, it was.

752
01:10:10,633 --> 01:10:13,193
Fine! l'll listen to it right now.
- No, not in my presence...

753
01:10:13,635 --> 01:10:15,157
No!

754
01:10:25,367 --> 01:10:26,697
Hello, Sunder...

755
01:10:27,968 --> 01:10:32,559
Your family has very aptly named you Sunder.

756
01:10:32,967 --> 01:10:36,296
Because you are indeed
'Sunder,(good looking)!

757
01:10:37,034 --> 01:10:41,728
l think the Creator has made you at leisure.

758
01:10:42,732 --> 01:10:44,130
Thank you.

759
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:47,696
l fell in love with you at first sight.

760
01:10:47,999 --> 01:10:49,332
Why didn't you tell me before?

761
01:10:49,332 --> 01:10:56,197
l hid this from you for so many days
because l hated the way you behaved.

762
01:10:58,299 --> 01:10:59,857
l apologize for that.

763
01:11:00,266 --> 01:11:05,198
There is no need to apologize.
l have already forgiven you.

764
01:11:07,699 --> 01:11:14,120
The other reason why l was quiet
was that, this is my first love.

765
01:11:14,432 --> 01:11:16,261
lt's my first love too!

766
01:11:16,699 --> 01:11:20,898
ls it your first love too?
- l swear it!

767
01:11:20,898 --> 01:11:26,489
Whenever l think of you, there's a stir in my heart.

768
01:11:27,197 --> 01:11:32,323
ls this love?
- Yes! This is love!

769
01:11:33,131 --> 01:11:36,858
Sunder, l hail from a very poor family.

770
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:39,787
l am not worthy of you at all.

771
01:11:40,263 --> 01:11:42,330
Even the clothes you see me wear are not mine.

772
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:48,321
These are given by my friends
who have come with me.

773
01:11:48,765 --> 01:11:51,629
And you come from such an affluent family!

774
01:11:51,997 --> 01:11:57,623
That's why l say that you and l are poles apart.

775
01:11:57,964 --> 01:12:00,589
Don't say such things... please!

776
01:12:00,929 --> 01:12:04,554
lt's a fact. That's why l want
you to knowthe truth about me.

777
01:12:04,896 --> 01:12:06,953
All these things make no difference to me!

778
01:12:07,296 --> 01:12:09,058
Think about it.
- l have!

779
01:12:09,763 --> 01:12:13,956
l will eagerly await you at Echo Point.

780
01:12:16,695 --> 01:12:18,127
l'm coming!

781
01:12:18,395 --> 01:12:19,861
Here l come!

782
01:12:40,296 --> 01:12:44,887
So the lady is already here.
Great! Let her wait.

783
01:12:45,495 --> 01:12:46,983
She has given me enough trouble.

784
01:12:47,128 --> 01:12:50,855
When Sunder arrive, what will l tell him?

785
01:12:51,228 --> 01:12:52,818
l will die of embarrassment.

786
01:12:53,228 --> 01:12:55,318
l have spoken my heart out in the tape recorder.

787
01:12:58,460 --> 01:13:00,993
So, you were hiding there to bother me?

788
01:13:00,993 --> 01:13:04,118
While l was anxiously waiting
for you here! Wicked man!

789
01:13:04,493 --> 01:13:06,584
Even you have made me wait
by the telephone all night!

790
01:13:06,893 --> 01:13:09,881
So is this how you take revenge!
l'll skin you alive now!

791
01:13:19,225 --> 01:13:23,282
When l saw you sitting there,
l was lost in another world.

792
01:13:25,726 --> 01:13:30,715
l felt as if all the world's
beauty was embodied in you.

793
01:13:31,992 --> 01:13:37,720
Nowtell me, are you a living deity of beauty...

794
01:13:38,425 --> 01:13:40,085
... or am l only dreaming?

795
01:13:41,925 --> 01:13:46,754
Sunder, these hands of mine are not as beautiful...

796
01:13:47,058 --> 01:13:49,523
...as the poets describe them...

797
01:13:50,291 --> 01:13:54,724
...but you'll see that they
will serve you day and night.

798
01:14:06,123 --> 01:14:09,419
You will not see diamonds in my eyes.

799
01:14:10,989 --> 01:14:14,284
But you will be in them forever.

800
01:14:23,356 --> 01:14:26,186
My lips may not be the perfect pink..

801
01:14:28,056 --> 01:14:31,147
...but they will always symbolize our love.

802
01:14:39,455 --> 01:14:43,784
Look, l am a straight and poor woman.

803
01:14:46,122 --> 01:14:48,553
Will you keep loving me like this forever?

804
01:14:56,388 --> 01:15:00,717
l will love you like this in all ages to come.

805
01:15:08,821 --> 01:15:12,378
Don't say that. l'll believe you.

806
01:15:12,955 --> 01:15:15,147
And l'll cry because of joy.

807
01:15:17,554 --> 01:15:19,019
l am telling the truth.

808
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:24,049
Tears are still coming to your
eyes so just let them come.

809
01:15:26,986 --> 01:15:30,009
Why are you whispering?

810
01:15:30,586 --> 01:15:32,518
So no one else will hear.

811
01:15:33,486 --> 01:15:36,384
They might cast an evil spell on us.

812
01:15:37,085 --> 01:15:39,244
But who's here besides me and you?

813
01:15:39,685 --> 01:15:44,549
The mountains, the ice, the wind...

814
01:15:45,551 --> 01:15:46,949
...their all listening.

815
01:15:47,218 --> 01:15:51,048
They don't understand us.

816
01:15:51,318 --> 01:15:56,684
No. They listen and they talk too.

817
01:15:57,753 --> 01:15:59,309
How?

818
01:15:59,686 --> 01:16:01,208
l'll show you.

819
01:16:32,082 --> 01:16:33,207
Now you say it.

820
01:16:34,249 --> 01:16:35,010
Say it.

821
01:17:05,282 --> 01:17:06,111
Now it's your turn.

822
01:17:10,181 --> 01:17:12,272
Say it otherwise they will be mad at you.

823
01:17:17,848 --> 01:17:21,507
They want to hear your voice.

824
01:17:22,347 --> 01:17:25,313
lt will be a symbol of our love.

825
01:17:25,847 --> 01:17:28,574
Give the first symbol of our love.

826
01:18:02,046 --> 01:18:06,807
"My love will forever remain youthful..."

827
01:18:07,078 --> 01:18:11,908
"it has been young, it will always be"

828
01:18:13,878 --> 01:18:18,413
"My love will forever remain youthful..."

829
01:18:18,413 --> 01:18:24,175
"it has been young, it will always be"

830
01:18:25,312 --> 01:18:30,301
"l will pine, and l will say..."

831
01:18:30,612 --> 01:18:36,202
"it has been young, it will always be"

832
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:56,308
"There's no one like you in the whole world..."

833
01:18:58,376 --> 01:19:02,741
"there isn't anyone like you in the whole world"

834
01:19:03,075 --> 01:19:07,736
"You are the one l have desired;

835
01:19:08,044 --> 01:19:11,443
"you are the one l have chosen"

836
01:19:11,443 --> 01:19:17,069
"You are the one l have chosen,
you, l will always choose"

837
01:19:17,377 --> 01:19:22,308
"Young, my love has been...
and it will always be"

838
01:19:24,175 --> 01:19:28,732
"My love will forever be youthful..."

839
01:19:29,075 --> 01:19:35,337
"it has always been... and it will forever be"

840
01:20:03,408 --> 01:20:10,033
"There's a fire raging in my heart..."

841
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:14,704
"there's a fire raging in my heart..."

842
01:20:15,007 --> 01:20:19,996
"it tells me that my goal is at hand"

843
01:20:20,306 --> 01:20:24,102
"My goal is right here"

844
01:20:24,439 --> 01:20:29,064
"These fires have never been
doused; they never will be"

845
01:20:29,372 --> 01:20:34,963
"lt has always been youthful...
and it will always be"

846
01:20:36,038 --> 01:20:40,493
"My love will forever remain youthful..."

847
01:20:40,838 --> 01:20:47,329
"lt has always been... and it will always be"

848
01:21:01,372 --> 01:21:06,360
"ln your arms if l were to die..."

849
01:21:08,170 --> 01:21:12,625
"in your arms if l were to die..."

850
01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:17,299
"how beautiful death would be"

851
01:21:17,503 --> 01:21:21,764
"How beautiful would death be"

852
01:21:22,036 --> 01:21:26,661
"Not even the pyres could destroy it..."

853
01:21:26,936 --> 01:21:30,800
"lt has always been young... it will always be"

854
01:21:33,471 --> 01:21:37,403
"My love will forever remain youthful..."

855
01:21:37,403 --> 01:21:44,036
"it has always been, it will always be"

856
01:21:44,036 --> 01:21:49,491
"l will pine for you and l will say..."

857
01:21:49,802 --> 01:21:56,166
"l will always love you as passionately"

858
01:24:18,996 --> 01:24:25,655
l think about you at night...

859
01:24:27,894 --> 01:24:39,657
... like wind flows quietly.

860
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:48,760
Like clouds move calmly through the sky...

861
01:24:49,961 --> 01:25:00,826
... like a sick person gains a miracle.

862
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:14,588
My heart dreams...

863
01:25:16,125 --> 01:25:25,888
...to fill your head with vermon.

864
01:25:27,925 --> 01:25:37,223
l have found out...

865
01:25:38,059 --> 01:25:47,253
...that your love is true.

866
01:25:49,125 --> 01:25:51,317
The flowers haven't bloomed.

867
01:25:51,725 --> 01:25:54,350
l haven't found her.

868
01:25:54,890 --> 01:25:57,981
Nor am l happy.

869
01:25:58,657 --> 01:26:09,079
Days passed in a daze.

870
01:26:10,257 --> 01:26:16,779
You have come...my search has ended.

871
01:26:17,155 --> 01:26:27,021
l have searched for a long time.

872
01:26:28,889 --> 01:26:39,981
Every day passes by...

873
01:26:40,688 --> 01:26:51,178
...and l can smell your fragrance.

874
01:26:53,721 --> 01:27:03,086
When l think of you, morning seems beautiful.

875
01:27:03,853 --> 01:27:13,514
When l feel your sadness,
my nights become restless.

876
01:27:15,587 --> 01:27:23,986
What hope am l living on?

877
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:36,077
l'm traveling a road where your no where in sight.

878
01:27:48,751 --> 01:27:50,808
Chintu, what's the matter?

879
01:27:51,951 --> 01:27:55,747
We are returning to Mumbai.
- What's there to cry about?

880
01:27:56,384 --> 01:28:00,782
That's what l'm telling him.
That l'll meet him every day.

881
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:03,374
Now what do l explain to her?

882
01:28:03,785 --> 01:28:07,978
You knowthat Dad must
be waiting for me at home!

883
01:28:08,385 --> 01:28:14,613
Why don't you say something, Sunder?
What about the SMDC prize?!

884
01:28:15,417 --> 01:28:18,110
What's the matter, Radha?
- l don't understand a thing.

885
01:28:18,484 --> 01:28:19,745
What's it about, Chintu?

886
01:28:21,384 --> 01:28:23,815
That's strictly between
Sunder and me.

887
01:28:24,451 --> 01:28:27,541
O, Sunder Munder,... may you be damned!

888
01:28:35,716 --> 01:28:38,739
Trust me. Only we will get the contract.

889
01:28:39,282 --> 01:28:41,077
lt will be signed by tomorrow or the day after that.

890
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:45,279
How can l trust you! What will
l tell Dad if he phones today?

891
01:28:45,582 --> 01:28:47,706
l will have to give an answer.

892
01:28:48,715 --> 01:28:51,979
- How are you?
- What's new?

893
01:28:52,283 --> 01:28:53,476
Mr. Manager, please bring the file.

894
01:28:53,783 --> 01:28:57,839
You've been in Calcutta since
4 days but you didn't meet me!

895
01:28:58,216 --> 01:29:02,171
What can l do? l am really
tied down with a contract.

896
01:29:02,482 --> 01:29:03,914
l understand.

897
01:29:06,549 --> 01:29:07,412
Yes...?

898
01:29:10,015 --> 01:29:13,344
What l feared, has happened.
lt's dad from Bombay.

899
01:29:13,948 --> 01:29:17,573
Obviously, it will be your father's
phone from Mumbai, not a film star's!

900
01:29:18,747 --> 01:29:20,236
What about the coal contract?

901
01:29:20,514 --> 01:29:23,207
We will get the contract by
tomorrow or the day after.

902
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:28,873
lndeed! What else could l hope
for from a useless man like you?!

903
01:29:29,413 --> 01:29:33,106
Do you have any idea, how much loss
l will incur if we lose the contract?

904
01:29:33,413 --> 01:29:36,970
But we are not delaying matters,
the people at Asansol are.

905
01:29:37,279 --> 01:29:38,540
Shut up!

906
01:29:39,112 --> 01:29:43,012
A clerk earning Rs.300'/- would
have done the job better than you!

907
01:29:43,314 --> 01:29:46,075
l made a mistake by sending
you to Calcutta! ldiot!

908
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:50,906
Daddy... hello!
O blast it! l hate this!

909
01:29:51,247 --> 01:29:54,236
He wants a slave, not a son!
- l've brought the file.

910
01:29:54,980 --> 01:29:58,434
To hell with it! l have nothing to do with this file!

911
01:29:58,846 --> 01:30:02,710
He scolds me and orders me around
all the time! l am fed up of life!

912
01:30:03,045 --> 01:30:05,238
Relax, Mr. Mahindra!
Every father...

913
01:30:05,546 --> 01:30:06,806
This is no time to joke!

914
01:30:07,578 --> 01:30:11,840
No, l am not joking!...
You've gone crazy.

915
01:30:12,278 --> 01:30:15,108
Come with me. l will take you to a place...

916
01:30:15,445 --> 01:30:17,876
where you will not only forget
your father but yourself too!

917
01:30:18,111 --> 01:30:20,542
Come on! Oh come on!

918
01:30:28,410 --> 01:30:29,775
Uncle.

919
01:30:31,145 --> 01:30:33,770
Your back? How are you?

920
01:30:34,144 --> 01:30:36,133
l'm great.

921
01:30:36,478 --> 01:30:40,637
Where's mom and dad?
-There eating. There waiting for you.

922
01:30:47,444 --> 01:30:51,399
You feed me a lot!
Just see the way l look! Alright.

923
01:30:52,010 --> 01:30:58,806
Daddy! Ma...
- My son! My son!

924
01:30:59,076 --> 01:31:01,668
You didn't even inform us.
- Or we,d have sent a car.

925
01:31:02,009 --> 01:31:03,907
Father, look, l have won the championship.

926
01:31:04,742 --> 01:31:07,469
Wonderful!

927
01:31:07,775 --> 01:31:10,502
Didn't l tell you that my son
would return a champion?

928
01:31:10,842 --> 01:31:13,103
Mother, has brother returned from Calcutta?

929
01:31:13,342 --> 01:31:15,171
Your father says that it will take 10-15 days more.

930
01:31:15,608 --> 01:31:17,974
Sit... feed him a lot.

931
01:31:18,276 --> 01:31:21,037
My son is a champion!

932
01:31:21,743 --> 01:31:25,004
l'll return by evening.
l'm busy. Sorry, son...

933
01:31:27,942 --> 01:31:29,805
You have not put on weight even
after returning from Kashmir.

934
01:31:30,109 --> 01:31:36,007
When l left from here, l weighed
1 70 pounds. l weigh 180 pounds now.

935
01:31:36,308 --> 01:31:37,365
Really?
- Yes.

936
01:31:37,674 --> 01:31:38,833
Touchwood!

937
01:31:39,075 --> 01:31:43,064
ls this a piece of wood!
Touch the chair or the table!

938
01:31:43,574 --> 01:31:46,404
How was your trip to Kashmir?

939
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:51,636
What are you asking! lt was a sheer
joy of living! Your son is in love.

940
01:31:51,974 --> 01:31:56,099
With Kashmir?
- Mother, you have spoilt it all!

941
01:31:56,673 --> 01:32:02,764
l am talking about a girl.
- Which family does she hail from?

942
01:32:03,139 --> 01:32:05,400
ls her father also a big businessman?

943
01:32:05,706 --> 01:32:09,470
No, mother. She is not a girl
from an affluent family like ours.

944
01:32:10,074 --> 01:32:12,733
She is poor, an orphan...

945
01:32:13,074 --> 01:32:16,506
Are you mad?! Do you want
to disgrace your family?

946
01:32:16,974 --> 01:32:20,565
You know your dad's nature. lf he
learns of it, it will be disastrous!

947
01:32:20,872 --> 01:32:27,202
l can sacrifice the world for her!

948
01:32:29,138 --> 01:32:34,832
l'm afraid, if the alliance does not
work out, it'll break your heart.

949
01:32:35,272 --> 01:32:39,670
Ma...
- Okay, go and change.

950
01:32:40,104 --> 01:32:43,195
Let me think of howto put across to your father.

951
01:32:43,538 --> 01:32:45,662
Oh Ma! You're a sweetheart!

952
01:32:47,071 --> 01:32:51,503
We,d visit the Dal Lake everyday.

953
01:32:51,937 --> 01:32:57,098
How was your competitor's game
in the tennis finals which you won?

954
01:32:57,571 --> 01:33:01,901
Her game was better than mine, but
she could not pick my swift services.

955
01:33:02,938 --> 01:33:05,199
And what about your friend Jamaal?

956
01:33:05,571 --> 01:33:07,332
She could not even reach the semi-finals.

957
01:33:07,670 --> 01:33:09,432
And what about the boys of your college?

958
01:33:09,804 --> 01:33:12,531
Amongst the three boys, only
Devendra reached the semi-finals.

959
01:33:12,937 --> 01:33:16,061
Whom Sunder of
St. Xavier's routed.

960
01:33:16,437 --> 01:33:18,800
He used to boast off a lot!
Sunder left him defenseless!

961
01:33:19,370 --> 01:33:23,029
Will you get up and work now or
keep discussing games all day?!

962
01:33:23,402 --> 01:33:26,129
The poor girl has just arrived.
Let her rest today.

963
01:33:26,502 --> 01:33:30,332
What was your darling doing
in Kashmir, if not resting?!

964
01:33:30,668 --> 01:33:32,225
My children were getting roasted in the heat.

965
01:33:32,568 --> 01:33:34,329
And this selfish girl was touring the mountains!

966
01:33:34,602 --> 01:33:36,898
Children, get up and eat your
breakfast. lt's time to go to school.

967
01:33:37,201 --> 01:33:39,326
Sapna, go and wash the clothes!...
And you also get up!

968
01:33:43,101 --> 01:33:46,160
lt wasn't only my fault!
That Sunder...

969
01:33:46,469 --> 01:33:50,595
Yes! Where is he?!
l have to thank him too.

970
01:33:50,935 --> 01:33:54,129
He was the first one to give me the
good news about the prize money.

971
01:33:55,035 --> 01:34:00,524
Sunder Munder is also damned!
But, father, l had not sent him here!

972
01:34:00,868 --> 01:34:03,663
He is a fool!
He came here on his own!

973
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:08,363
What nonsense are you talking!

974
01:34:08,701 --> 01:34:11,565
Do you know l bought some defense bonds...

975
01:34:11,901 --> 01:34:13,833
with the Rs.50,000'/- which SMDC awarded me?

976
01:34:14,467 --> 01:34:16,830
Say that again!
What award did you get?

977
01:34:17,133 --> 01:34:19,690
The first prize of cash worth Rs.50,000'/-.

978
01:34:20,067 --> 01:34:22,498
You mean you really won it?
- Yes.

979
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:26,025
l got the prize the next day
after you left for Kashmir.

980
01:34:26,433 --> 01:34:29,557
- My dream came true?!
- lt most certainly did!

981
01:34:29,899 --> 01:34:32,992
Believe it or not,
last night l dreamt...

982
01:34:33,434 --> 01:34:36,264
that you were getting me
married to a girl from Lucknow.

983
01:34:36,467 --> 01:34:39,955
Then we'll have to fulfill that dream too.

984
01:34:40,533 --> 01:34:43,193
Tell me her address and l,
ll go meet her tomorrow.

985
01:35:01,465 --> 01:35:04,487
Tell me something. How do you
like these two names?

986
01:35:04,831 --> 01:35:07,296
Sanjeev and Sunderta?

987
01:35:07,698 --> 01:35:11,130
One name appears to be
a boy's, the other, a girl's.

988
01:35:11,431 --> 01:35:12,862
Correct.
- Why?

989
01:35:13,264 --> 01:35:15,661
Who are they?
Do l knowthem?

990
01:35:15,964 --> 01:35:19,191
No, you don't knowthem now, but you will, later.

991
01:35:19,663 --> 01:35:21,424
Because these are the
names of our future children.

992
01:35:21,765 --> 01:35:23,787
Quiet! Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?

993
01:35:23,998 --> 01:35:25,691
What's there to feel ashamed of?
We will get married.

994
01:35:25,965 --> 01:35:27,863
And after that, naturally, we will have children!

995
01:35:28,198 --> 01:35:32,027
So l've already chosen the names.
- But why choose two names?

996
01:35:32,431 --> 01:35:35,726
Because l don't know whether
it'll be a boy first or a girl.

997
01:35:35,997 --> 01:35:38,395
Give me some assurance.
So l chose both the names.

998
01:35:39,097 --> 01:35:43,256
Both the names are very nice.
Sunder, let's get married fast.

999
01:35:44,063 --> 01:35:45,495
You're a girl and you talk this way!

1000
01:35:45,829 --> 01:35:52,557
But what do l do?
l love you very much.

1001
01:35:52,929 --> 01:35:55,394
l'm afraid that somebody may
snatch you away from me.

1002
01:35:56,696 --> 01:36:00,128
Crazy girl, l should be the one to feel afraid.

1003
01:36:00,494 --> 01:36:02,960
Just think. There's no other
lovely girl like you in this world...

1004
01:36:03,261 --> 01:36:04,784
who will enter my life again.

1005
01:36:05,361 --> 01:36:07,122
l have already spoken to my mother.

1006
01:36:07,561 --> 01:36:09,424
l am only mustering courage to speak to father.

1007
01:36:13,296 --> 01:36:15,727
You are a very disturbing element, Mr. Chintu.

1008
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:19,219
Keep mustering courage, while we,
ll even be getting married in 2 days.

1009
01:36:19,495 --> 01:36:21,619
l knowthat.
- Really, Chintu? Congrats!

1010
01:36:21,995 --> 01:36:23,460
- Thank you!
-Congratulations, Radha! Please sit.

1011
01:36:23,795 --> 01:36:26,818
We won't sit. We have to distribute many cards.

1012
01:36:27,261 --> 01:36:30,886
l've invited 2,000 guests and at
least a thousand will surely come.

1013
01:36:31,228 --> 01:36:33,421
And even if 500 of them bring gifts,...

1014
01:36:33,794 --> 01:36:37,282
then we won't have to buy any
household items for 5 years!

1015
01:36:37,727 --> 01:36:41,454
How mean! Does one think like that?
- l think of everything.

1016
01:36:41,859 --> 01:36:43,382
Don't bore me now!
- What do you mean...?

1017
01:36:43,826 --> 01:36:45,258
Can l...?
- Sit down.

1018
01:36:45,726 --> 01:36:48,954
Sapna, won't you help us in distributing the cards?

1019
01:36:49,292 --> 01:36:52,190
We will. Let him get the bill.
And you will pay it. Finish the coffee.

1020
01:36:54,526 --> 01:36:57,787
Did you hear? Chintu's friend
is presenting a very good item.

1021
01:36:59,860 --> 01:37:01,450
Hey! Where's your father?

1022
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:05,319
He is somewhere here... there he is!

1023
01:37:06,293 --> 01:37:08,724
Oh yes! There he is...
See you.

1024
01:37:24,858 --> 01:37:26,050
Ladies and gentlemen...

1025
01:37:26,792 --> 01:37:30,985
take your seats, please.
Go on.

1026
01:37:31,291 --> 01:37:33,950
There is no need to mention
why we have assembled here.

1027
01:37:34,357 --> 01:37:38,585
Our classmate... your dear friend...

1028
01:37:39,023 --> 01:37:44,320
Chintu - his dream of national
integration has come true today.

1029
01:37:45,323 --> 01:37:48,950
All of you have come on this special occasion.

1030
01:37:49,358 --> 01:37:53,154
On this special occasion, we would
like to present a song to you.

1031
01:38:12,189 --> 01:38:17,247
"Look, no one knows yet."

1032
01:38:17,622 --> 01:38:23,020
"Look, no one knows yet."

1033
01:38:23,555 --> 01:38:26,453
"My heart loves you."

1034
01:38:26,821 --> 01:38:29,188
"My heart loves you."

1035
01:38:29,188 --> 01:38:34,643
"Look, no one knows yet."

1036
01:38:34,987 --> 01:38:40,047
"Look, no one knows yet."

1037
01:38:41,122 --> 01:38:43,679
"My heart loves you."

1038
01:38:44,022 --> 01:38:46,283
"My heart loves you."

1039
01:39:01,554 --> 01:39:06,884
"We meet because of destiny."

1040
01:39:07,186 --> 01:39:15,414
"We also create false promises."

1041
01:39:15,752 --> 01:39:20,945
"We meet because of destiny."

1042
01:39:21,285 --> 01:39:29,185
"We also create false promises."

1043
01:39:29,987 --> 01:39:32,350
"My heart loves you."

1044
01:39:32,620 --> 01:39:34,744
"My heart loves you."

1045
01:39:35,086 --> 01:39:40,484
"Look, no one knows yet."

1046
01:39:40,919 --> 01:39:46,249
"Look, no one knows yet."

1047
01:39:46,952 --> 01:39:49,474
"My heart loves you."

1048
01:39:49,851 --> 01:39:52,749
"My heart loves you."

1049
01:40:07,050 --> 01:40:12,380
"Our smile is always distant."

1050
01:40:12,716 --> 01:40:21,413
"We see sorrow in every joy."

1051
01:40:21,717 --> 01:40:26,809
"Our smile is always distant."

1052
01:40:27,083 --> 01:40:35,482
"We see sorrow in every joy."

1053
01:40:35,749 --> 01:40:37,977
"My heart loves you."

1054
01:40:38,216 --> 01:40:40,546
"My heart loves you."

1055
01:40:40,882 --> 01:40:46,008
"Look, no one knows yet."

1056
01:40:46,349 --> 01:40:51,645
"Look, no one knows yet."

1057
01:40:52,081 --> 01:40:54,808
"My heart loves you."

1058
01:40:55,114 --> 01:40:57,739
"My heart loves you."

1059
01:41:12,015 --> 01:41:17,640
"Why should we care about the world now?"

1060
01:41:18,048 --> 01:41:26,242
"lf they want to make excuses, let them."

1061
01:41:26,747 --> 01:41:31,576
"Why should we care about the world now?"

1062
01:41:31,913 --> 01:41:40,107
"lf they want to make excuses, let them."

1063
01:41:40,279 --> 01:41:42,540
"My heart loves you."

1064
01:41:42,845 --> 01:41:45,107
"My heart loves you."

1065
01:41:45,312 --> 01:41:50,801
"Look, no one knows yet."

1066
01:41:51,111 --> 01:41:56,477
"Look, no one knows yet."

1067
01:41:56,846 --> 01:41:59,539
"My heart loves you."

1068
01:41:59,913 --> 01:42:02,208
"My heart loves you."

1069
01:42:02,446 --> 01:42:07,468
"Look, no one knows yet."

1070
01:42:07,779 --> 01:42:13,075
"Look, no one knows yet."

1071
01:42:13,645 --> 01:42:16,406
"My heart loves you."

1072
01:42:16,678 --> 01:42:19,110
"My heart loves you."

1073
01:42:19,611 --> 01:42:21,634
"My heart loves you."

1074
01:42:21,878 --> 01:42:24,400
"My heart loves you."

1075
01:43:13,942 --> 01:43:18,135
l did not approve of one thing.
- Yes?

1076
01:43:18,441 --> 01:43:22,373
You have designed 13 doors for the
house and l don't like number 13.

1077
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:25,431
Oh! Even you believe in numerology!

1078
01:43:27,574 --> 01:43:33,634
Hello Sunder, my son... my darling son!

1079
01:43:34,075 --> 01:43:36,632
My younger son Sunder.

1080
01:43:37,008 --> 01:43:39,735
Meet Mr. Sinha,
Mrs. Sinha...

1081
01:43:40,008 --> 01:43:45,372
That's Miss Sinha...
Your future sister-in-law.

1082
01:43:47,974 --> 01:43:50,872
Excuse me, l'll change and come.
- Please do.

1083
01:43:52,674 --> 01:43:54,731
He plays tennis very well.
- Really?

1084
01:43:55,340 --> 01:43:57,397
Have some sweets on this joyous occasion.

1085
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:01,405
You should have at least asked
brother before fixing the alliance.

1086
01:44:06,673 --> 01:44:09,104
Sheel... listen to this.

1087
01:44:09,406 --> 01:44:11,598
Sir J.P. considers No. 13 to
be unlucky just like you do.

1088
01:44:13,772 --> 01:44:16,863
Excuse me, Sir.
- What's it?

1089
01:44:17,839 --> 01:44:19,635
l'll be back soon.
- No problem.

1090
01:44:20,006 --> 01:44:22,234
- Carry on.
- Have some sweets.

1091
01:44:22,573 --> 01:44:24,005
- Sure!
- You haven't eaten a thing.

1092
01:44:25,739 --> 01:44:29,102
l'll be back soon... l'm sorry.

1093
01:44:33,505 --> 01:44:37,562
l've been told that you work in my
office. What do you want to say?

1094
01:44:38,171 --> 01:44:40,864
l don't approve of my employees coming home.

1095
01:44:41,338 --> 01:44:44,997
Sir, it's something very important.
That's why l have come to you.

1096
01:44:45,305 --> 01:44:48,395
Then say it quickly! l don't
have time for trivial matters!

1097
01:44:48,737 --> 01:44:51,202
l have affluent guests at home!
Hurry up!

1098
01:44:52,337 --> 01:44:54,303
Oh God! Bansi...

1099
01:44:56,469 --> 01:44:57,730
Now, go on.

1100
01:44:58,237 --> 01:45:02,794
Just tell me when Mr. Mahindra
will be returning from Calcutta.

1101
01:45:03,136 --> 01:45:04,693
What have you to do with Mr. Mahindra?

1102
01:45:05,203 --> 01:45:10,535
Everything. He means everything to me.
- What nonsense are you talking!

1103
01:45:13,737 --> 01:45:15,895
Are you in your senses?

1104
01:45:16,237 --> 01:45:20,896
l wrote many letters to Calcutta
but did not receive any replies.

1105
01:45:21,269 --> 01:45:25,361
Stop talking in riddles! Explicitly
state your relationship with him!

1106
01:45:28,303 --> 01:45:32,826
Well, l... l am carrying his child.

1107
01:45:34,002 --> 01:45:38,457
lt cannot be! This is a lie!

1108
01:45:38,901 --> 01:45:41,890
l have told you the truth.
- Shut up!

1109
01:45:42,668 --> 01:45:46,361
My son isn't the kind to disgrace
himself with a worthless typist!

1110
01:45:46,935 --> 01:45:52,196
l am poor, but it's not just a few
rich people who are decent!

1111
01:45:52,967 --> 01:45:56,799
How can a woman possessing
no honor, speak about respect?!

1112
01:45:57,936 --> 01:46:02,867
Doesn't love mean anything to you?
Mr. Mahindra loves me.

1113
01:46:03,468 --> 01:46:08,025
He had said that he would
convince you to get us married.

1114
01:46:08,634 --> 01:46:10,327
l am familiar with such tricks!

1115
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,693
You only want to extort money
from the rich by speaking like this!

1116
01:46:14,034 --> 01:46:17,830
Trust me, l have not come to
you with any such intention.

1117
01:46:19,333 --> 01:46:24,231
Every blackmailer says so! How much
money do you need to get lost?!

1118
01:46:24,866 --> 01:46:26,059
10,000?

1119
01:46:27,532 --> 01:46:30,726
You cannot weigh the honor
of a decent girl with money!

1120
01:46:31,532 --> 01:46:33,794
How can you speak about honor?

1121
01:46:34,465 --> 01:46:38,556
A decent girl does not lose her
chastity before marriage like you!

1122
01:46:39,165 --> 01:46:41,323
God is witness to our marriage.

1123
01:46:41,731 --> 01:46:43,663
Do not malign my innocent son!

1124
01:46:44,066 --> 01:46:47,089
lf you can't marry the man who
has put you in this mess,...

1125
01:46:47,567 --> 01:46:52,022
then, out of pity, l am ready to help you! Just wait!

1126
01:46:56,399 --> 01:47:00,763
Here's 20,000'/-! And don't ever
show me your dirty face again!

1127
01:47:04,398 --> 01:47:07,626
The arrogance of money drives man so blind!

1128
01:47:19,330 --> 01:47:21,761
Mr. Sunder!

1129
01:47:22,163 --> 01:47:25,288
Do you know a lady called Seema
who works in the boss's office?

1130
01:47:25,829 --> 01:47:28,693
Yes, l do. She is supposed
to get married to brother.

1131
01:47:28,930 --> 01:47:32,259
Oh no! The boss humiliated her
and threw her out of the house.

1132
01:47:32,596 --> 01:47:35,063
l fear she may harm herself.
- Why?

1133
01:47:35,431 --> 01:47:38,555
She mentioned that she was pregnant.
Please go and save her soon!

1134
01:47:54,129 --> 01:47:57,526
Bansi has told me everything. Meet
me at the station in half an hour.

1135
01:47:57,828 --> 01:47:59,794
l'll take you to
Calcutta to brother.

1136
01:48:00,062 --> 01:48:01,391
lf God wishes, everything will be all right.

1137
01:48:01,795 --> 01:48:05,693
Why hasn't he replied to my letters?
- We'll talk to him about that.

1138
01:48:06,061 --> 01:48:08,289
There is very little time.
We have to board the 7.30 train.

1139
01:48:08,561 --> 01:48:10,255
Please hurry up!
- Okay.

1140
01:48:12,094 --> 01:48:13,889
Thank you all for coming.

1141
01:48:14,661 --> 01:48:17,024
Chintu, why are you traveling third class?

1142
01:48:17,527 --> 01:48:21,483
What can l do? My respected
father gave me so little money...

1143
01:48:21,862 --> 01:48:23,885
that l got third class tickets with great difficulty.

1144
01:48:24,228 --> 01:48:25,717
Else, l was planning to travel without a ticket!

1145
01:48:26,895 --> 01:48:29,883
Radha, which places will you go to?
- Ask him.

1146
01:48:30,428 --> 01:48:33,155
We plan to undertake an All lndia tour.

1147
01:48:33,561 --> 01:48:38,550
From here, we will be going to
Nagpur, Sholapur, Jaipur, Kanpur...

1148
01:48:38,893 --> 01:48:40,519
What's it!... And to Gurdaspur.

1149
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:45,017
But why hasn't Sunder come yet?

1150
01:48:45,327 --> 01:48:48,622
l am surprised myself. He had told
me that he,d come here directly.

1151
01:48:48,893 --> 01:48:51,518
And he is never late.
- There's Sunder!

1152
01:48:59,892 --> 01:49:06,051
But who was that lady with Sunder?
- Sapna, do you knowthat lady?

1153
01:49:13,459 --> 01:49:14,254
Hello...?

1154
01:49:15,059 --> 01:49:19,548
Pardon?... Mr. Sunder is not here.
He is away in Calcutta.

1155
01:49:20,392 --> 01:49:25,086
l cannot say when he'll return.
His friend suddenly fell ill...

1156
01:49:25,425 --> 01:49:27,050
so Mr. Sunder has gone to reach him to Calcutta.

1157
01:49:34,558 --> 01:49:38,115
He has gone to Calcutta.
His friend suddenly fell ill.

1158
01:49:38,457 --> 01:49:40,218
So Mr. Sunder has gone to reach him to Calcutta.

1159
01:49:40,990 --> 01:49:42,717
When will Sunder return?

1160
01:49:43,523 --> 01:49:47,285
lt will take 8-10 days. He said
that his friend suddenly fell ill.

1161
01:49:47,790 --> 01:49:49,312
So he was taking him to Calcutta.

1162
01:49:49,722 --> 01:49:52,950
All right. Mahindra is also there.
Both of them will return together.

1163
01:49:56,056 --> 01:49:59,023
Do you know what plans
l have for Sunder?

1164
01:50:00,723 --> 01:50:03,212
When he returns with a degree from Germany,...

1165
01:50:03,723 --> 01:50:06,780
l will talk to him about getting married
to Justice Saxena's daughter.

1166
01:50:07,523 --> 01:50:09,887
Nowthat you have raised
the issue, let me tell you...

1167
01:50:10,156 --> 01:50:13,316
that Sunder loves somebody.
- Really? Who is she?

1168
01:50:13,889 --> 01:50:19,617
The girl Sunder danced with, at Chintu's wedding.

1169
01:50:19,956 --> 01:50:23,388
Oh! She looks very sweet.
- Yes!

1170
01:50:23,622 --> 01:50:29,054
Whose daughter is she?
- Someone has raised her. That's it.

1171
01:50:29,254 --> 01:50:30,618
Who are her parents?

1172
01:50:31,221 --> 01:50:34,812
That's not exactly known. The poor
girl was brought from an orphanage.

1173
01:50:35,121 --> 01:50:38,883
What nonsense!
Has Sunder gone crazy?!

1174
01:50:39,288 --> 01:50:43,481
Does he think he's doing a noble
deed by marrying an orphan?

1175
01:50:43,820 --> 01:50:46,012
He's set to become a social worker!

1176
01:50:46,353 --> 01:50:48,446
Please don't break his heart;
he wants to marry her.

1177
01:50:48,721 --> 01:50:50,550
Please meet the girl's family once.

1178
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:09,679
Sir...
- Sit down!

1179
01:51:13,120 --> 01:51:14,278
Who is Sapna?

1180
01:51:14,886 --> 01:51:20,284
Sapna? Are you inquiring about my daughter?

1181
01:51:22,985 --> 01:51:26,348
Don't you knowthat she is trying to
cast my son, Sunder, under her spell?

1182
01:51:26,752 --> 01:51:28,377
l don't understand.

1183
01:51:29,451 --> 01:51:32,315
She is dreaming of marrying him!

1184
01:51:33,118 --> 01:51:36,677
As is the desire of several other
girls from lower class families!

1185
01:51:37,053 --> 01:51:40,507
Believe me, Sapna is not such a girl.

1186
01:51:40,819 --> 01:51:43,376
Go home and give her a character certificate!

1187
01:51:43,919 --> 01:51:45,385
l have called you today...

1188
01:51:45,818 --> 01:51:50,046
because l want to put an end to Sapna's drama!

1189
01:51:50,652 --> 01:51:52,515
l assure that she is not...

1190
01:51:52,951 --> 01:51:57,407
An orphan who doesn't even
know about her parents...

1191
01:51:57,884 --> 01:52:00,146
ls she worth being my daughter-in-law?!

1192
01:52:00,918 --> 01:52:05,179
l ask, even if Sapna was your own daughter,...

1193
01:52:05,517 --> 01:52:07,880
would she have been worthy
of being my daughter-in-law?!

1194
01:52:10,083 --> 01:52:14,606
You are a rich man.
You can say anything.

1195
01:52:16,916 --> 01:52:21,678
For how long have you been working in my office?

1196
01:52:22,049 --> 01:52:24,913
Well, l have grayed, serving you.

1197
01:52:25,217 --> 01:52:26,978
How many children of your own do you have?

1198
01:52:27,317 --> 01:52:28,476
Four.

1199
01:52:29,083 --> 01:52:35,016
lf you lose this job, you know
the plight they will be in.

1200
01:52:35,416 --> 01:52:38,541
And you knowthat if l wish, then
you won't get a job elsewhere.

1201
01:52:38,882 --> 01:52:44,746
Sir, please don't think that way.
l am a very poor man.

1202
01:52:45,415 --> 01:52:47,813
l have served you with all sincerity.

1203
01:52:48,515 --> 01:52:50,674
Then, do this much more.

1204
01:52:51,115 --> 01:52:55,547
Get Sapna married elsewhere.
l give you 10 days time.

1205
01:52:55,948 --> 01:52:57,311
You may leave now.

1206
01:53:06,980 --> 01:53:12,912
You'll get your pay, when she gets
married within 10 days, understand?

1207
01:53:13,213 --> 01:53:17,011
Sapna is my daughter. l won't get
her married to just about anybody!

1208
01:53:17,447 --> 01:53:22,141
And l will not let my kids starve
to death because of your darling!

1209
01:53:22,514 --> 01:53:25,275
What will happen when your
boss sacks you after 10 days?!

1210
01:53:25,714 --> 01:53:28,975
l never said that l don't want to get her married.

1211
01:53:29,347 --> 01:53:33,904
But l must find a suitable boy.
- ls Ramlal not a good match?

1212
01:53:34,213 --> 01:53:38,145
His character is questionable.
He's a drunkard.

1213
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:41,741
So do you think your darling girl
is going to get a noble soul?!

1214
01:53:42,046 --> 01:53:45,239
Don't interfere! l'll call the
boy's family tomorrow...

1215
01:53:45,579 --> 01:53:46,704
and fix the alliance, okay?!

1216
01:53:47,012 --> 01:53:49,705
You may not have conceived
Sapna, yet she is your daughter.

1217
01:53:50,245 --> 01:53:52,506
Will Ramlal mend his ways after marriage?

1218
01:53:53,012 --> 01:53:55,341
Yes, he will.
Leave everything to me.

1219
01:53:55,711 --> 01:53:59,802
All right, as you wish. But
let's ask Sapna for her opinion.

1220
01:54:00,178 --> 01:54:02,975
Hear, hear! Will we have to
take her opinion also now?!

1221
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:05,438
l will call Ramlal tomorrow and fix the alliance!

1222
01:54:06,512 --> 01:54:08,808
Mother, sister is crying.

1223
01:54:13,978 --> 01:54:16,103
- Father!
- My dear!

1224
01:54:16,411 --> 01:54:18,377
Please don't push me into this hell!

1225
01:54:18,678 --> 01:54:21,473
l will not marry Ramlal.
l will die!

1226
01:54:21,844 --> 01:54:24,833
l am helpless, my dear.

1227
01:54:25,111 --> 01:54:27,406
That's enough! This drama won't do here!

1228
01:54:27,777 --> 01:54:30,743
l will call the boy's family tomorrow!
And listen to me carefully!

1229
01:54:31,010 --> 01:54:33,272
lf you misbehave,
l will not spare you!

1230
01:54:33,610 --> 01:54:35,734
Come on! Let's go!

1231
01:54:37,076 --> 01:54:41,906
Sister!
Please don't cry!

1232
01:54:42,676 --> 01:54:45,698
Please eat, son.
- Please eat.

1233
01:54:48,109 --> 01:54:51,406
The sweet dish is delicious! l think
Sapna must have prepared it.

1234
01:54:52,111 --> 01:54:55,906
l understand!... Go and ask
Sapna to bring some hot tea.

1235
01:54:59,509 --> 01:55:01,338
Please eat...
Ramlal, please help yourself.

1236
01:55:19,675 --> 01:55:23,072
Respected father, when you read this letter,...

1237
01:55:23,507 --> 01:55:25,598
l will have gone very far away.

1238
01:55:26,074 --> 01:55:29,869
Maybe, away from life, from a
place where one never returns.

1239
01:55:30,340 --> 01:55:33,272
l cannot marry anybody else but Sunder.

1240
01:55:33,606 --> 01:55:37,231
And you cannot fix this alliance.
l understand your helplessness.

1241
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:41,574
So, l can think of no other way but to kill myself.

1242
01:55:41,841 --> 01:55:43,739
Has your desire been fulfilled at least now?

1243
01:55:44,141 --> 01:55:48,698
A poor girl's shadow won't be cast
on your affluent family now, right?

1244
01:55:49,574 --> 01:55:53,131
l am my daughter's murderer!
l have killed her!

1245
01:55:53,541 --> 01:55:55,166
l have killed her!

1246
01:56:10,772 --> 01:56:13,397
Sunder, l wanted to kill myself.

1247
01:56:13,772 --> 01:56:16,465
But your love deprived me of
the courage to do even that.

1248
01:56:17,038 --> 01:56:18,799
You may have returned to Mumbai by now.

1249
01:56:19,205 --> 01:56:23,432
lf you still love me, then come here
as soon as you receive the letter.

1250
01:56:23,771 --> 01:56:26,737
And save me from this dilemma
between life and death.

1251
01:56:28,404 --> 01:56:34,235
Come in, Mr. Manager.
- You have been here for a week.

1252
01:56:34,672 --> 01:56:39,536
As per the rules of our guest-house,
you should vacate the room today.

1253
01:56:40,938 --> 01:56:44,200
l am extremely worried as it is, Mr. Manager.

1254
01:56:44,671 --> 01:56:48,831
l still have not found the man
l came in search of, to Calcutta.

1255
01:56:49,237 --> 01:56:51,169
Please give me a few days more.

1256
01:56:51,504 --> 01:56:56,731
Okay, l'll give you 4-5 days more.
But l won't wait beyond that.

1257
01:57:03,303 --> 01:57:05,201
You didn't find out anything even today, did you?

1258
01:57:09,135 --> 01:57:11,033
Calcutta is a very big city, Seema.

1259
01:57:12,502 --> 01:57:15,491
But l assure you, l will surely find brother.

1260
01:57:16,535 --> 01:57:19,560
You have been assuring
me of this since 8-10 days.

1261
01:57:20,203 --> 01:57:22,761
But l know my fate.

1262
01:57:23,436 --> 01:57:27,697
Please don't waste your time
for me. Go back to Mumbai.

1263
01:57:28,802 --> 01:57:30,995
l can understand your disappointment, Seema.

1264
01:57:31,669 --> 01:57:34,794
But why do you forget that he is
not only the world of your desires...

1265
01:57:35,235 --> 01:57:41,394
but my brother as well?
- Why has he left me in the lurch?

1266
01:57:43,234 --> 01:57:46,961
No, Seema, don't...
Everything will be fine.

1267
01:57:55,433 --> 01:57:56,989
This is Sunder. Who's speaking?

1268
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:03,456
Yes! l'll be down in a jiffy!

1269
01:58:04,833 --> 01:58:07,596
Congratulations, Seema!
We have found brother!

1270
01:58:07,935 --> 01:58:09,797
lt was our Manager's phone.
He's waiting for me downstairs.

1271
01:58:10,101 --> 01:58:11,226
l'll be back soon!

1272
01:58:15,734 --> 01:58:17,757
Mr. Manager, where is my brother and how is he?

1273
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:20,664
What do l say? l feel embarrassed mentioning it.

1274
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:22,829
Why? ls everything all right?

1275
01:58:23,200 --> 01:58:26,223
He is involved with a courtesan
named Bahaar these days.

1276
01:58:26,566 --> 01:58:28,555
And he has been in her house since many days.

1277
01:58:29,232 --> 01:58:33,062
A courtesan?... Brother is
involved with a courtesan?

1278
01:58:37,732 --> 01:58:38,789
What's this?

1279
01:58:39,331 --> 01:58:42,195
What was the need to apply
'alta, on such lovely feet?

1280
01:58:42,931 --> 01:58:45,829
l would have kissed them and made them red.

1281
01:58:46,064 --> 01:58:48,552
Come off it! Can one trust the word of men?

1282
01:58:49,031 --> 01:58:52,861
They kiss feet at night, and don't
even see the woman's face at dawn!

1283
01:58:53,197 --> 01:58:57,597
No. My love for you is true.

1284
01:58:58,299 --> 01:59:01,696
l swear by these lovely feet!
- No, brother, don't!

1285
01:59:02,865 --> 01:59:06,661
One swears by the feet of those angels
who show men the correct path.

1286
01:59:06,998 --> 01:59:09,623
You! What are you doing here?

1287
01:59:13,898 --> 01:59:16,261
My search for you has brought me here.

1288
01:59:16,597 --> 01:59:20,892
Who is he?
- He is my younger brother Sunder.

1289
01:59:21,297 --> 01:59:25,661
And, Sunder, she is my darling Bahaar.

1290
01:59:25,897 --> 01:59:27,055
Hello.

1291
01:59:27,962 --> 01:59:32,327
Elders introduce the younger
ones to nice and noble people.

1292
01:59:32,662 --> 01:59:34,094
And you introduce me to...

1293
01:59:34,795 --> 01:59:38,386
Let him speak.
l will not be offended.

1294
01:59:38,729 --> 01:59:41,194
Please sit.
- No, thanks!

1295
01:59:41,629 --> 01:59:44,426
Brother, please come out.
l want to tell you something.

1296
01:59:44,730 --> 01:59:47,094
No! Say whatever you have to, in front of Bahaar!

1297
01:59:47,663 --> 01:59:51,356
What's wrong with you? Aren't you
even concerned about your honor?

1298
01:59:51,796 --> 01:59:55,989
Don't speak only about honor!
Talk about our affluent family too!

1299
01:59:56,229 --> 01:59:59,251
Just as father does, whom l hate!

1300
02:00:00,495 --> 02:00:02,358
Does one speak like that about elders?

1301
02:00:02,695 --> 02:00:04,183
Yes! Why not?!

1302
02:00:04,529 --> 02:00:08,756
Go and tell your darling daddy
that his son has become a rebel!

1303
02:00:09,327 --> 02:00:13,157
He has used me like a pawn all along!

1304
02:00:13,494 --> 02:00:16,051
But l am free man today;
l am not his slave!

1305
02:00:16,461 --> 02:00:18,926
ls this the way to express your freedom?

1306
02:00:19,426 --> 02:00:21,915
You can sit across the table
and resolve your differences.

1307
02:00:22,226 --> 02:00:24,658
- Why run away like this?
- Who says so?!

1308
02:00:25,059 --> 02:00:27,651
What am l afraid of?!
What am l running away from?!

1309
02:00:27,959 --> 02:00:32,586
From life, reality... from love!
Whose name is Seema.

1310
02:00:32,828 --> 02:00:36,089
Whose name was Seema! Now,
the name of that love is Bahaar!

1311
02:00:36,394 --> 02:00:39,360
My darling, you love me, don't you?

1312
02:00:40,194 --> 02:00:44,853
See?
- She loves your money, not you!

1313
02:00:45,060 --> 02:00:47,719
This is a lie! She has sacrificed everything for me!

1314
02:00:48,059 --> 02:00:49,616
She loves only me!

1315
02:00:49,859 --> 02:00:53,189
This is not love but a pretense, a charade!

1316
02:00:53,792 --> 02:00:57,280
She is not a woman, but a
disgrace to womanhood!

1317
02:00:57,859 --> 02:01:00,017
She is a whore!
- Shut up!

1318
02:01:17,191 --> 02:01:21,284
This is what binds you with her... alcohol.

1319
02:01:21,759 --> 02:01:24,815
Whereas, you and l share a bond of blood.

1320
02:01:26,025 --> 02:01:28,752
And blood is not cheap like wine!

1321
02:02:05,555 --> 02:02:07,986
Seema, please don't ask me
anything as l cannot tell you a word!

1322
02:02:09,021 --> 02:02:12,750
What! ls there another girl?

1323
02:02:13,723 --> 02:02:17,951
Girl? Had it been a girl, it would
have been a different matter.

1324
02:02:18,422 --> 02:02:23,081
Because every girl is somebody's
sister, daughter or lover.

1325
02:02:23,555 --> 02:02:27,851
But brother is involved with a... a prostitute!

1326
02:02:29,054 --> 02:02:30,748
Who does not belong to anyone!

1327
02:02:31,088 --> 02:02:34,611
Trapped in the false love of that prostitute,...

1328
02:02:34,854 --> 02:02:36,911
he has forgotten himself, his family, me... and...

1329
02:02:37,654 --> 02:02:40,347
... and you also.
He has forgotten...

1330
02:02:55,919 --> 02:02:57,714
Now, sleep for half an hour.

1331
02:02:58,585 --> 02:03:00,610
You will recover with this injection.

1332
02:03:01,220 --> 02:03:03,277
Come here everyday.
l'll change your dressing.

1333
02:03:07,887 --> 02:03:10,080
l am not badly hurt, am l?

1334
02:03:10,387 --> 02:03:14,409
No. God saved you.
Now, sleep for half an hour.

1335
02:03:21,619 --> 02:03:25,052
Don't get up. lt's the doctor's order. Go to sleep.

1336
02:03:36,951 --> 02:03:40,678
Don't speak. The doctor has asked
you not to even speak. Go to sleep.

1337
02:03:42,384 --> 02:03:45,679
Congratulations!
You are going to be a father.

1338
02:03:48,218 --> 02:03:50,446
Don't you believe it?

1339
02:03:51,051 --> 02:03:53,108
When a man hears he's going
to be a father for the first time...

1340
02:03:53,485 --> 02:03:55,075
he often gets nervous.

1341
02:03:55,885 --> 02:03:58,976
There's no need to get worried.
She fainted because of weakness.

1342
02:03:59,351 --> 02:04:00,874
Otherwise she is perfectly healthy.

1343
02:04:01,184 --> 02:04:03,650
l have prescribed the medicines.
Give it to her regularly.

1344
02:04:04,050 --> 02:04:08,641
Your fees?
- Rs. 15. Give it to the nurse.

1345
02:04:27,082 --> 02:04:31,571
Please don't stop me, doctor!
Let me die!

1346
02:04:32,548 --> 02:04:35,945
You are like my daughter.
Share your sorrows with me.

1347
02:04:36,550 --> 02:04:38,811
l will surely help you.

1348
02:04:39,883 --> 02:04:43,043
l've had enough of these excuses!
l want the hotel bill!

1349
02:04:43,649 --> 02:04:45,581
Excuses?
What do you mean?

1350
02:04:46,015 --> 02:04:48,981
My Money Order hasn't arrived, so
where will l give you the money from?

1351
02:04:49,315 --> 02:04:51,974
l also forgot to carry my
Diners club card. Ask her.

1352
02:04:52,249 --> 02:04:54,646
l don't know about that! l want
you to pay the bill for 4 days!

1353
02:04:54,915 --> 02:04:59,244
lt's the limit. You humiliate a big
shot like me just for the payment!

1354
02:04:59,581 --> 02:05:01,069
Come to Mumbai.

1355
02:05:01,414 --> 02:05:05,539
l will extend my hospitality to you
for 8 days, and yet, not insult you.

1356
02:05:05,881 --> 02:05:09,972
Don't act too smart! Will you
pay or should l call the police?

1357
02:05:10,413 --> 02:05:12,106
There is no need for you to do that!

1358
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:14,978
Take these and adjust it with the bill!

1359
02:05:15,213 --> 02:05:16,940
You don't have the courtesy
to talk to decent people!

1360
02:05:17,247 --> 02:05:19,008
- lt is a fact.
- Hey! Chintu!

1361
02:05:21,679 --> 02:05:25,010
Did you see?
This is my Money Order!

1362
02:05:25,580 --> 02:05:27,375
What are both of you doing here?

1363
02:05:27,647 --> 02:05:29,374
We are on a fabulous honeymoon tour.

1364
02:05:29,647 --> 02:05:31,237
We have already been to many places.

1365
02:05:31,547 --> 02:05:34,479
We went to many religious places.

1366
02:05:34,813 --> 02:05:36,507
And were leaving for Jhumri Talaiya.

1367
02:05:36,779 --> 02:05:39,177
Father's Money Order has not yet
arrived, so this man got suspicious.

1368
02:05:39,646 --> 02:05:41,202
Or we would have escaped
the day before yesterday.

1369
02:05:41,546 --> 02:05:44,239
And he has been humiliating
us for a paltry amount!

1370
02:05:44,546 --> 02:05:47,636
- Open insult!
- Put their bill in my account.

1371
02:05:53,411 --> 02:05:55,309
How could you come away
without informing Sapna?

1372
02:05:55,578 --> 02:05:57,907
And what are you doing in
Calcutta? Where is Sapna?

1373
02:05:58,211 --> 02:05:59,938
And who is she?

1374
02:06:03,444 --> 02:06:07,137
Go to my room upstairs.
l'll explain everything.

1375
02:06:07,477 --> 02:06:09,033
- Okay.
- My room keys...?

1376
02:06:20,211 --> 02:06:24,234
ls this the time to come? l have
been waiting for you since so long.

1377
02:06:25,211 --> 02:06:28,836
Come and be the good fortune of my life!

1378
02:06:34,177 --> 02:06:35,938
Greetings!
- Who are you?

1379
02:06:36,409 --> 02:06:39,398
My name is Sheikh Kalimullah.

1380
02:06:39,776 --> 02:06:43,230
l represent His Royal Highness...

1381
02:06:43,876 --> 02:06:51,297
Sir Bachchan Singh of
Dhum Dham Nagar.

1382
02:06:51,575 --> 02:06:53,131
l am his secretary.
- What are you doing here?

1383
02:06:53,408 --> 02:06:55,873
l have come to meet Ms. Bahaar.

1384
02:06:56,175 --> 02:06:58,436
My name is Bahaar.
What is it?

1385
02:06:58,774 --> 02:07:06,004
My king is all praise for you.
He wants to hear you sing and dance.

1386
02:07:07,642 --> 02:07:12,098
Tell your king that l have quit
doing that since some days.

1387
02:07:12,375 --> 02:07:15,170
You don't refuse His Highness!

1388
02:07:15,575 --> 02:07:19,904
His chartered plane will take him
to Timbucktoo tomorrow morning.

1389
02:07:20,408 --> 02:07:22,101
There's just one night in between.

1390
02:07:22,508 --> 02:07:25,406
Perform one night and my king
will shower you with gold!

1391
02:07:25,608 --> 02:07:26,801
l said l am helpless.

1392
02:07:27,141 --> 02:07:31,539
Your bad luck!
Anyway, what can l do?

1393
02:07:35,206 --> 02:07:37,468
Take this.
- What's this?

1394
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:39,967
Necklace.

1395
02:07:40,507 --> 02:07:44,700
His Highness had asked me
to give you this if you refused.

1396
02:07:45,106 --> 02:07:47,162
And if you had agreed, then...

1397
02:07:47,906 --> 02:07:50,928
You mean, he gives gifts even
when someone refuses?

1398
02:07:52,940 --> 02:07:55,236
His Highness has wealth in abundance.

1399
02:07:55,607 --> 02:08:00,039
And he always bestows gifts on beauties!

1400
02:08:00,573 --> 02:08:03,437
Then, bring him here.
l am ready to sing and dance.

1401
02:08:05,039 --> 02:08:06,902
And remember that...

1402
02:08:07,273 --> 02:08:08,295
His Highness...

1403
02:08:08,606 --> 02:08:18,436
... is a bit crazy.
- No problem.

1404
02:08:29,204 --> 02:08:31,635
Hurry up! lt's time for brother to come.

1405
02:08:38,370 --> 02:08:41,337
My dear Sunder, think again.

1406
02:08:41,438 --> 02:08:44,734
lf your scheme fails, then we'll be
playing instruments here forever!

1407
02:08:46,538 --> 02:08:48,299
Don't lose heart, my boy.

1408
02:08:48,671 --> 02:08:52,727
Remember! You are king now!
- A King!

1409
02:08:54,937 --> 02:09:01,062
Attention! Here comes
His Highness Bachchan Singh...

1410
02:09:01,403 --> 02:09:06,266
... of Dhum Dham Nagar.

1411
02:09:10,402 --> 02:09:13,197
Please sit down, Your Highness!
- Please sit.

1412
02:11:05,762 --> 02:11:10,753
"lt was through my eyes..."

1413
02:11:11,098 --> 02:11:14,552
"that l spoke to him"

1414
02:11:14,964 --> 02:11:19,260
"l spoke to him"

1415
02:11:19,563 --> 02:11:27,621
"Only my heart knows what it went through"

1416
02:11:27,996 --> 02:11:32,088
"What has my heart been through"

1417
02:11:32,462 --> 02:11:40,792
"lt was through my eyes... that l spoke to him"

1418
02:11:41,362 --> 02:11:50,317
"lt was through my eyes... that l spoke to him"

1419
02:12:33,392 --> 02:12:41,688
"All night, l spoke to the stars in the skies"

1420
02:12:42,126 --> 02:12:50,254
"l missed someone... and l pined"

1421
02:12:50,626 --> 02:12:59,082
"What has happened to me...?
What affliction does my heart suffer?"

1422
02:12:59,459 --> 02:13:07,516
"ln my memories of someone,
l spend my days"

1423
02:13:13,024 --> 02:13:17,615
"Through my eyes..."

1424
02:13:17,991 --> 02:13:21,786
"l spoke to him"

1425
02:13:22,491 --> 02:13:26,218
"l spoke to him"

1426
02:13:26,623 --> 02:13:34,921
"My heart alone knows... what it went through"

1427
02:13:35,358 --> 02:13:39,346
"What my heart went through"

1428
02:13:39,791 --> 02:13:44,689
"Through my eyes..."

1429
02:14:16,855 --> 02:14:25,277
"ln every word he conveyed,
there was the intoxication of wine"

1430
02:14:25,755 --> 02:14:33,915
"l had not a sip... but l was drunk"

1431
02:14:34,421 --> 02:14:43,047
"l was not in control of myself;
my feet were wobbly..."

1432
02:14:43,421 --> 02:14:51,683
"Wine, there wasn't... but it
all had to do with getting high"

1433
02:14:55,986 --> 02:15:00,680
"Through my eyes..."

1434
02:15:01,085 --> 02:15:05,074
"l spoke to him"

1435
02:15:05,519 --> 02:15:09,541
"l spoke to him"

1436
02:15:09,987 --> 02:15:18,408
"My heart alone knows..
what it has been through"

1437
02:15:18,786 --> 02:15:22,775
"What has my heart been through"

1438
02:15:23,152 --> 02:15:28,084
"Through my eyes..."

1439
02:16:10,717 --> 02:16:19,172
"She was the one who figured in
every conversation all the time"

1440
02:16:19,549 --> 02:16:27,640
"l know not where my heart is...
nor is the heart aware of itself"

1441
02:16:28,116 --> 02:16:36,741
"l did my best to hide it... but word had spread"

1442
02:16:36,981 --> 02:16:45,209
"The whole city now knows which heart is on fire"

1443
02:16:50,282 --> 02:16:53,873
"Through my eyes..."

1444
02:16:54,849 --> 02:16:59,474
"Through my eyes..."

1445
02:16:59,881 --> 02:17:03,813
"l spoke to him"

1446
02:17:04,181 --> 02:17:08,237
"l spoke to him"

1447
02:17:08,581 --> 02:17:11,603
"My heart alone knows..."

1448
02:17:12,646 --> 02:17:21,341
"My heart alone knows...
what it has been through"

1449
02:17:21,745 --> 02:17:25,871
"What has my heart been through"

1450
02:17:26,246 --> 02:17:31,610
"Through my eyes..."

1451
02:17:36,147 --> 02:17:38,113
Would you like to come in my car?

1452
02:17:41,546 --> 02:17:44,239
Bahaar, what's happening?!

1453
02:17:44,513 --> 02:17:46,876
Who are you?... who the hell is this turkey?!

1454
02:17:47,113 --> 02:17:49,738
lf you say, then we'll send him out.

1455
02:17:50,212 --> 02:17:54,974
You need not bother. l'll send him
away and return soon...Come on.

1456
02:17:55,278 --> 02:17:58,142
Don't talk nonsense! Who are they
and what are they doing here?

1457
02:17:58,378 --> 02:18:02,434
Send them away!
- Oh! This turkey insults us!

1458
02:18:04,478 --> 02:18:07,807
They will not leave.
They are my guests...

1459
02:18:08,144 --> 02:18:10,632
They have paid the price
l demanded, for my song and dance.

1460
02:18:10,877 --> 02:18:12,900
The price you demanded!
lmmoral woman!

1461
02:18:13,243 --> 02:18:15,209
Leave my hand!
- You've shown your true colors!

1462
02:18:15,577 --> 02:18:18,338
Your love for me was a sham!
- Leave my hand!

1463
02:18:18,709 --> 02:18:21,175
l am not your wife, that you
exercise your right over me!

1464
02:18:21,509 --> 02:18:22,668
Shameless woman!

1465
02:18:22,976 --> 02:18:25,102
l disgraced the honor of my family for you!

1466
02:18:25,478 --> 02:18:26,910
l raised my hand on my brother!

1467
02:18:28,277 --> 02:18:31,868
Don't you dare raise your
hand on my brother again!

1468
02:18:41,809 --> 02:18:46,901
Why are you staring at me?!
l'm Sunder. Do you recognize me?!

1469
02:18:49,542 --> 02:18:53,269
Yes. l staged this drama to open your eyes.

1470
02:18:53,708 --> 02:18:59,902
And l brought these clothes and fake
jewelery from a drama company!

1471
02:19:00,241 --> 02:19:04,730
They're all fake!
How we fooled you!

1472
02:19:05,141 --> 02:19:06,470
Beat them up!

1473
02:20:17,839 --> 02:20:19,066
My brother!

1474
02:21:04,670 --> 02:21:07,363
Hurry up or you will get late for school.

1475
02:21:09,936 --> 02:21:11,526
Mr. Sunder, what brings you here?

1476
02:21:13,169 --> 02:21:16,794
Are you Sapna's father?
Hello! This is amazing!

1477
02:21:17,102 --> 02:21:19,625
We met in Kashmir when
we had gone to play tennis.

1478
02:21:19,968 --> 02:21:21,934
You're still here!
Take her to school...

1479
02:21:22,534 --> 02:21:25,329
He is my boss's son Mr. Sunder.

1480
02:21:26,035 --> 02:21:27,864
Please come in and sit, sir.

1481
02:21:28,167 --> 02:21:29,758
l am no sir. l am plain and simple Sunder.

1482
02:21:30,768 --> 02:21:34,131
l've just returned from Calcutta.
l thought l,d meet Sapna on the way.

1483
02:21:34,567 --> 02:21:36,465
Please sit.
- You too. How are you?

1484
02:21:36,767 --> 02:21:37,994
l'm fine.
- Where is Sapna?

1485
02:21:39,166 --> 02:21:40,862
Take her back to where
you have brought her from!

1486
02:21:41,168 --> 02:21:42,691
She has no place in my house!

1487
02:21:42,935 --> 02:21:46,197
Please think, daddy.
l have married her.

1488
02:21:46,701 --> 02:21:49,565
She is your daughter-in-law!
- Don't call her my daughter-in-law!

1489
02:21:50,167 --> 02:21:51,929
You should have thought about it earlier...

1490
02:21:52,568 --> 02:21:57,625
that if you marry her, l will
have nothing to do with you!

1491
02:21:58,034 --> 02:22:00,727
But why not? What is the poor girl's fault?!

1492
02:22:01,500 --> 02:22:02,864
Do you want to know her fault?

1493
02:22:03,867 --> 02:22:05,832
l ask, what is her position in society?!

1494
02:22:06,200 --> 02:22:11,291
By accepting a girl from an ordinary
family as my daughter-in-law,...

1495
02:22:11,833 --> 02:22:15,094
l cannot disgrace my family!

1496
02:22:15,732 --> 02:22:20,255
And if you wish good for yourself,
then send her packing right away!

1497
02:22:20,665 --> 02:22:24,256
No, daddy! Seema cannot
be separated from me now!

1498
02:22:24,731 --> 02:22:27,060
l can give up everything in this world!

1499
02:22:27,531 --> 02:22:28,862
Even you!

1500
02:22:29,366 --> 02:22:32,593
What will be your position
without my name and support?!

1501
02:22:32,966 --> 02:22:36,023
What you call as support, is a burden...

1502
02:22:36,365 --> 02:22:38,422
under which l have been crushed all my life!

1503
02:22:39,065 --> 02:22:44,259
Until now, you made me dance to your
tune and l kept living at your mercy!

1504
02:22:44,731 --> 02:22:47,629
But l want to severe this relationship today!

1505
02:22:47,898 --> 02:22:49,796
Mahindra! Are you in your senses?

1506
02:22:50,098 --> 02:22:52,825
l am in my senses, mother.
Perhaps, for the first time in life!

1507
02:22:53,231 --> 02:22:55,389
But he!... He is devoid of his senses!

1508
02:22:55,764 --> 02:22:57,354
Get out!
- Do not scream!

1509
02:22:57,797 --> 02:23:00,854
l myself do not wish to live
in this condition of slavery!

1510
02:23:01,130 --> 02:23:03,289
Let's go, Seema...
Come on!

1511
02:23:03,696 --> 02:23:06,787
And l will hate you for as long as l live!

1512
02:23:07,197 --> 02:23:09,754
You are not the only one who hates him, brother!

1513
02:23:10,262 --> 02:23:12,626
l share the same feelings.

1514
02:23:13,162 --> 02:23:16,594
l will keep hating him with every fiber of my being!

1515
02:23:16,895 --> 02:23:18,624
Have you also gone crazy?!

1516
02:23:18,964 --> 02:23:22,157
Read this letter and you will
know how ruthless he is!

1517
02:23:24,263 --> 02:23:27,058
Oh! So, you had taken this girl to Calcutta?

1518
02:23:27,497 --> 02:23:32,485
You took advantage of my absence
and killed an innocent girl!

1519
02:23:33,863 --> 02:23:35,385
How could you do this...?

1520
02:23:37,529 --> 02:23:41,052
By tearing this letter, you can't
be absolved of your crime!

1521
02:23:41,395 --> 02:23:44,293
Watch your tongue! How dare
you talk, like this to your father?!

1522
02:23:44,462 --> 02:23:46,485
And do you think l am going to kiss
your hand stained with blood?!

1523
02:23:47,095 --> 02:23:48,890
lmpertinent boy!
- Do not raise your hand!

1524
02:23:49,961 --> 02:23:52,791
Or even l will raise my hand today!

1525
02:23:54,761 --> 02:24:00,591
My son, Sunder, no! Don't!

1526
02:24:00,860 --> 02:24:02,689
No, mother.

1527
02:24:03,027 --> 02:24:07,757
Only a man who loses his ability
to reason, indulges in fisticuffs.

1528
02:24:08,728 --> 02:24:11,421
And l am still in my senses, mother.

1529
02:24:13,694 --> 02:24:16,353
All of you, get out!

1530
02:24:16,661 --> 02:24:19,183
What's wrong with you?!
- Do not interfere!

1531
02:24:19,494 --> 02:24:22,982
Let him also go away! From
now on, they are not my sons!

1532
02:24:23,294 --> 02:24:27,226
But they are certainly my sons.
l cannot live without them.

1533
02:24:27,626 --> 02:24:31,524
This is my house and nobody can
live here against my wishes!

1534
02:24:31,793 --> 02:24:33,917
But even l have a right over this house!

1535
02:24:34,259 --> 02:24:36,724
Nobody else has a right over this house, only l do!

1536
02:24:37,059 --> 02:24:40,684
Why stay in a place where humans
are not respected? Come with us.

1537
02:24:42,225 --> 02:24:45,589
And let him revel in the
loneliness of this house!

1538
02:24:48,392 --> 02:24:51,983
Go upstairs or you will regret for life!

1539
02:24:54,593 --> 02:24:57,058
lnstead of living in this house
like a servant,...

1540
02:24:57,725 --> 02:25:01,782
l would prefer to live with
my children as their mother!

1541
02:25:02,159 --> 02:25:06,284
ls that so? Then you too may get out of my sight!

1542
02:25:07,392 --> 02:25:10,051
All of you, listen to me very carefully!

1543
02:25:10,591 --> 02:25:14,546
lf you return someday and grovel before me,...

1544
02:25:15,058 --> 02:25:18,421
even then, l shall not accept any of you!

1545
02:25:18,890 --> 02:25:21,720
You will not derive that joy from us in this life.

1546
02:25:22,523 --> 02:25:23,784
Let's go, mother.

1547
02:25:29,623 --> 02:25:31,589
l have to give you some news.
- What?

1548
02:25:33,123 --> 02:25:36,577
l will be going to Laos.
- Laos? Why?

1549
02:25:37,255 --> 02:25:40,312
Our government is sending
a medical mission to Laos.

1550
02:25:40,689 --> 02:25:44,554
l will be going as part of it.
- Had you applied for it?

1551
02:25:45,124 --> 02:25:46,249
Yes.

1552
02:25:46,523 --> 02:25:50,114
l read in the papers 10 days ago
that nurses were urgently needed.

1553
02:25:50,457 --> 02:25:55,219
l,d also applied. They've replied
today that l have been selected.

1554
02:25:55,523 --> 02:25:59,386
l am pleased that you want to serve others.

1555
02:25:59,823 --> 02:26:05,016
But why go so far away? There
is no dearth of patients here too.

1556
02:26:06,022 --> 02:26:11,454
l feel stifled here now. l want to go
somewhere far away from here.

1557
02:26:12,321 --> 02:26:15,515
And there is a great need of
nurses in Laos these days.

1558
02:26:15,987 --> 02:26:19,976
My blessings will always be
with you wherever you go.

1559
02:26:21,221 --> 02:26:21,549
When do you have to leave?

1560
02:26:22,987 --> 02:26:26,419
We will be sent by air to Laos three days later.

1561
02:27:27,019 --> 02:27:30,712
Why are you crying?
What's the matter with you?

1562
02:27:32,285 --> 02:27:34,876
My heart cries, looking at the state of this house.

1563
02:27:35,418 --> 02:27:40,316
For the first time in 30 years,
l'm giving you food, your wife isn't.

1564
02:27:41,085 --> 02:27:45,176
You are eating all alone and not with your family.

1565
02:27:45,451 --> 02:27:48,939
Don't mention them in front
of me! They are dead for me!

1566
02:27:49,550 --> 02:27:51,539
May God bestowthem with a long life.

1567
02:27:52,084 --> 02:27:56,641
What does not exist, is your heart
as there is no love in it anymore!

1568
02:27:56,949 --> 02:27:59,938
Stop talking nonsense!
l don't want to hear any sermons!

1569
02:28:00,450 --> 02:28:04,506
You are a servant here and learn
to speak in the capacity of one!

1570
02:28:07,115 --> 02:28:08,876
Stupid fool!

1571
02:28:10,284 --> 02:28:14,978
You know l don't eat such spicy
food! You've got my tongue on fire!

1572
02:28:15,316 --> 02:28:17,373
Your wife used to cook your food.

1573
02:28:17,783 --> 02:28:20,772
So, who knows whether she
used to make it spicy or not?

1574
02:28:21,083 --> 02:28:25,879
Shut up, you fool! You've set my tongue on fire!

1575
02:28:28,749 --> 02:28:30,941
Blast it!
Who has put ice in this?

1576
02:28:32,715 --> 02:28:34,646
Don't you even knowthat
l do not drink cold water?!

1577
02:28:35,115 --> 02:28:37,047
Go and fetch some plain water!

1578
02:28:37,948 --> 02:28:40,005
He has become so old, but he has no sense.

1579
02:28:40,481 --> 02:28:42,276
The bloody freeloader!

1580
02:28:43,748 --> 02:28:47,077
Nobody knows what l eat and drink!

1581
02:28:56,313 --> 02:29:01,179
Where the hell are you! Have you
gone to get water or dig a well?!

1582
02:29:01,481 --> 02:29:05,072
Ask somebody else nowto bring
what you want to eat or drink.

1583
02:29:05,414 --> 02:29:07,607
Meaning?
- l am quitting.

1584
02:29:08,047 --> 02:29:09,535
l will not stay in this house any longer!

1585
02:29:09,880 --> 02:29:12,539
Wretched man!... What did you say!

1586
02:29:14,313 --> 02:29:15,301
You dare!

1587
02:29:17,046 --> 02:29:20,308
Ungrateful wretch!
- You are right, Sir!

1588
02:29:20,779 --> 02:29:24,177
Had l been grateful, l would have
gone away with your family!

1589
02:29:24,646 --> 02:29:28,100
Yet l stayed with you!
This certainly was being ungrateful!

1590
02:29:28,546 --> 02:29:32,205
But l thought you would
regret what you had done...

1591
02:29:32,578 --> 02:29:37,442
that you would pacify your
loved ones and bring them back!

1592
02:29:38,144 --> 02:29:42,133
This was my folly.
- So get out from here!

1593
02:29:42,545 --> 02:29:47,002
After all, you are as wretched
as the blood that flows in you!

1594
02:29:47,512 --> 02:29:50,410
And is your blood very superior?!
Very pure?!

1595
02:29:51,245 --> 02:29:54,177
Shall l tell the truth?
Will you able to hear it?

1596
02:29:54,479 --> 02:29:56,501
You will not be shattered hearing it, will you?!

1597
02:29:57,212 --> 02:29:59,643
What truth?

1598
02:30:00,511 --> 02:30:05,341
Think and speak or l will slice
your tongue off! Wretched man!

1599
02:30:05,710 --> 02:30:07,142
Had l been a wretched man,...

1600
02:30:07,378 --> 02:30:11,707
l would not have kept a secret
of your family for 50 years!

1601
02:30:12,177 --> 02:30:16,802
l had promised your father,
l would never ever let you know...

1602
02:30:17,110 --> 02:30:18,700
that he was not your father.

1603
02:30:19,077 --> 02:30:23,634
And that you are not even a
child of the Srivastav family!

1604
02:30:23,943 --> 02:30:28,704
Bansi! Take back your words!

1605
02:30:29,575 --> 02:30:31,632
Or l'll kill you!

1606
02:30:33,009 --> 02:30:37,409
Say that this is a lie!
That you are not in your senses!

1607
02:30:37,943 --> 02:30:40,841
Say that you blabbered all
this in a state of madness!

1608
02:30:41,776 --> 02:30:45,333
l can consider your age and forgive you even now!

1609
02:30:45,910 --> 02:30:51,206
l swear that all this is the truth.

1610
02:30:51,875 --> 02:30:54,670
l had brought you from an orphanage.

1611
02:30:55,042 --> 02:30:56,837
No!
- Yes!

1612
02:30:57,575 --> 02:31:00,541
Your father was childless.

1613
02:31:00,908 --> 02:31:03,874
He then decided to adopt a child secretly.

1614
02:31:04,375 --> 02:31:08,773
He made me his confidante and
brought you from an orphanage.

1615
02:31:09,140 --> 02:31:13,596
Even the proprietor of the orphanage
didn't knowthe names of your parents!

1616
02:31:13,940 --> 02:31:16,462
No! This is a lie!

1617
02:31:16,807 --> 02:31:21,671
This is a lie! lt is!

1618
02:31:25,475 --> 02:31:28,338
Sir!

1619
02:31:51,372 --> 02:31:54,463
You have opened your eyes after 24 hours.

1620
02:31:55,172 --> 02:31:56,899
God has saved your life.

1621
02:31:57,771 --> 02:32:02,533
The doctor said that you had a heart attack.

1622
02:32:03,005 --> 02:32:06,095
You are not supposed to get
up from your bed for 2 months.

1623
02:32:06,604 --> 02:32:08,763
Please don't say that, Bansi.

1624
02:32:10,304 --> 02:32:14,533
How can l remain in bed?

1625
02:32:15,206 --> 02:32:19,535
l have to pacify the members of my family.

1626
02:32:20,672 --> 02:32:23,433
l must apologize to Seema.

1627
02:32:25,238 --> 02:32:27,999
l have to bring back everybody.

1628
02:32:28,905 --> 02:32:31,961
Really, Sir?
- Yes.

1629
02:32:32,904 --> 02:32:38,996
You have done me a favor by opening my eyes.

1630
02:32:39,970 --> 02:32:41,560
Don't stop me now.

1631
02:32:42,437 --> 02:32:46,426
l will grovel before them and pacify them.

1632
02:32:46,736 --> 02:32:50,862
No, Sir! Please don't get up!

1633
02:32:51,669 --> 02:32:55,396
They aren't just your family.
They mean everything to me too.

1634
02:32:55,868 --> 02:32:58,266
l'll pacify them and bring them back.

1635
02:33:07,370 --> 02:33:08,960
No, mother, this cannot be.

1636
02:33:09,469 --> 02:33:12,526
Before leaving, make up your mind if
your sons are dearer to you or he is.

1637
02:33:13,736 --> 02:33:19,066
Sunder and you are the light of
my eyes, and he is my heartbeat.

1638
02:33:19,935 --> 02:33:23,594
lf the heart stops beating, how
will there be any light in the eyes?

1639
02:33:24,002 --> 02:33:27,126
lf both of you don't wish to
come, it's fine. l'll take Seema...

1640
02:33:27,401 --> 02:33:28,731
You will not go, Seema.

1641
02:33:29,034 --> 02:33:31,466
She is my daughter-in-law,
she cannot disobey me.

1642
02:33:31,700 --> 02:33:36,359
You also come with us. This
is not the time to be angry.

1643
02:33:37,100 --> 02:33:41,828
He has accepted me, so you must forgive him.

1644
02:33:42,100 --> 02:33:44,964
l can never forgive him for the way he treated me!

1645
02:33:45,267 --> 02:33:48,755
You can't go either! You are my wife!
A woman is the shadow of a man!

1646
02:33:49,066 --> 02:33:51,330
Anger plunges you in darkness right now.

1647
02:33:51,701 --> 02:33:54,064
And a shadow does not
follow a person in the dark.

1648
02:33:54,500 --> 02:33:58,660
He is ill. We ought to be near him and serve him.

1649
02:33:59,500 --> 02:34:03,489
Please come with us.
- Come on, Mahindra.

1650
02:34:06,300 --> 02:34:07,357
Let's go, my dear.

1651
02:34:11,766 --> 02:34:12,958
Let's go, Sunder.

1652
02:34:16,865 --> 02:34:21,388
lt would be nice if you would
come. He needs both of you.

1653
02:34:50,432 --> 02:34:52,693
Where were you?

1654
02:34:58,997 --> 02:35:00,258
My daughter-in-law.

1655
02:35:01,696 --> 02:35:03,628
Come here.

1656
02:35:06,164 --> 02:35:09,186
Bless you... come closer.

1657
02:35:10,563 --> 02:35:13,051
Father!
- My dear.

1658
02:35:15,196 --> 02:35:19,389
l have caused you a lot of pain.
Please forgive me.

1659
02:35:19,862 --> 02:35:24,055
Father! Please don't embarrass
me by saying anything more.

1660
02:35:25,795 --> 02:35:27,624
You are so very nice.

1661
02:35:35,829 --> 02:35:39,125
My sons have not come, have they?

1662
02:35:44,228 --> 02:35:50,252
How could they come?
l have wronged them greatly.

1663
02:35:54,361 --> 02:35:57,350
They should never forgive me.

1664
02:35:58,361 --> 02:36:00,350
Never.

1665
02:36:02,027 --> 02:36:06,015
But how will
l live without them?

1666
02:36:06,827 --> 02:36:08,951
Daddy...

1667
02:36:12,492 --> 02:36:15,219
Mahindra!
- Come, my son.

1668
02:36:18,628 --> 02:36:22,923
Come to me, my sons!
Come to me.

1669
02:36:23,894 --> 02:36:30,087
My sons! You have forgiven me.
How fortunate l am!

1670
02:36:30,527 --> 02:36:32,617
How lucky l am!

1671
02:36:33,226 --> 02:36:36,817
Sunder, go and fetch Sapna.

1672
02:36:37,193 --> 02:36:38,624
Fetch her.

1673
02:36:41,759 --> 02:36:49,179
ls Sapna alive?
- Yes, my son. Your Sapna is alive.

1674
02:36:50,625 --> 02:36:53,284
She went to Calcutta in search of you.

1675
02:36:54,458 --> 02:36:57,015
She had written a letter to you from there.

1676
02:36:59,557 --> 02:37:03,455
Which l had burnt because of misplaced pride.

1677
02:37:03,791 --> 02:37:05,622
She had written a letter! When?

1678
02:37:06,192 --> 02:37:09,919
When you had gone with Seema to Calcutta.

1679
02:37:10,358 --> 02:37:12,483
Why didn't you tell me the other day?

1680
02:37:12,858 --> 02:37:17,517
Then l didn't want you to find her and marry her.

1681
02:37:18,158 --> 02:37:20,021
But that was my folly.

1682
02:37:23,323 --> 02:37:25,789
Charter a plane and go.

1683
02:37:26,023 --> 02:37:28,716
Find Sapna.

1684
02:37:29,090 --> 02:37:32,988
lf she is alive, then l will bring her back!

1685
02:37:33,723 --> 02:37:35,484
Do you remember the Calcutta address?

1686
02:37:36,790 --> 02:37:40,313
The letter had come from some guest-house.

1687
02:37:41,256 --> 02:37:45,120
That's more than enough! l'll
search the whole of Calcutta!

1688
02:37:45,488 --> 02:37:48,283
Hey, fool, take some money!

1689
02:37:59,523 --> 02:38:01,182
Have you kept the luggage in the car?

1690
02:38:04,022 --> 02:38:05,578
l have kept the luggage in the taxi.

1691
02:38:06,789 --> 02:38:08,311
Keep writing to me.

1692
02:38:09,221 --> 02:38:13,017
And if you ever think about your
country, come straight to me.

1693
02:38:13,788 --> 02:38:17,777
Even l won't feel like working
in this hospital without you.

1694
02:38:25,654 --> 02:38:26,949
No, she has left.

1695
02:38:27,287 --> 02:38:32,218
l think she is working as a nurse
with Dr. Banerjee at Tollygunj.

1696
02:38:32,653 --> 02:38:34,619
Thank you very much.

1697
02:38:38,952 --> 02:38:41,214
Doctor, where is Sapna?

1698
02:38:42,719 --> 02:38:46,016
You are the same man, aren't you?
What have you to do with her now?

1699
02:38:46,354 --> 02:38:49,877
l love her and have chartered
a plane from Mumbai for her.

1700
02:38:50,387 --> 02:38:52,784
Have you come alone or
brought your wife along too?

1701
02:38:54,087 --> 02:38:57,984
Wife?
- The one who's carrying your child!

1702
02:38:59,686 --> 02:39:02,083
And whom you had brought to my hospital.

1703
02:39:02,952 --> 02:39:07,077
She is my sister-in-law, my elder brother's wife.

1704
02:39:07,419 --> 02:39:09,442
She is like a mother to me.
- O, hell!

1705
02:39:09,851 --> 02:39:14,045
Then why didn't you say so,
when l congratulated you?

1706
02:39:14,551 --> 02:39:16,608
lt was the question of her honor then.

1707
02:39:17,284 --> 02:39:21,546
And l had to protect her at
any cost, so l remained quiet.

1708
02:39:22,051 --> 02:39:25,245
Oh my God!
What injustice!

1709
02:39:25,650 --> 02:39:29,878
Sapna was in this hospital the
day you had brought Seema here.

1710
02:39:30,250 --> 02:39:33,582
And she still thinks that you
are going to be a father.

1711
02:39:33,985 --> 02:39:36,076
So she is catching the flight at 11 .20 today...

1712
02:39:36,385 --> 02:39:38,180
and leaving for Laos for good.

1713
02:39:38,885 --> 02:39:41,851
She's going to Laos by the 11 .20 flight?

1714
02:39:48,151 --> 02:39:49,082
To the airport, quickly!

1715
02:39:54,483 --> 02:39:57,005
Take this... Now speed up!

1716
02:40:01,016 --> 02:40:02,447
This is the question of my life and death!

1717
02:40:03,849 --> 02:40:07,178
Drive faster.
Jump the signal!

1718
02:40:41,448 --> 02:40:42,379
Faster!

1719
02:40:44,781 --> 02:40:46,111
Stop the taxi!

1720
02:40:53,213 --> 02:40:54,236
Show me your license!

1721
02:40:54,746 --> 02:40:56,337
lnspector, it isn't the poor man's fault...

1722
02:40:56,646 --> 02:40:59,771
l'm not talking to you, mister.
Show me your license!

1723
02:41:00,479 --> 02:41:01,570
Look, Officer...

1724
02:41:05,446 --> 02:41:07,173
even you are young like me.

1725
02:41:07,512 --> 02:41:10,003
Your heart must also beat
with somebody's love, right?

1726
02:41:10,347 --> 02:41:13,802
My beloved is upset with me and
is leaving lndia for good today.

1727
02:41:14,180 --> 02:41:16,805
The departure is at 11 .20.
lf l don't reach before that...

1728
02:41:17,113 --> 02:41:20,204
she will go away from my life forever.

1729
02:41:20,546 --> 02:41:24,171
Please have mercy on me.
- So it's a matter of the heart?

1730
02:41:24,713 --> 02:41:28,769
Then why are you using this junk?
l'll take you there.

1731
02:41:35,545 --> 02:41:39,204
lnspector, l will not forget this favor all my life.

1732
02:41:40,011 --> 02:41:42,239
People always misunderstand the police.

1733
02:41:42,744 --> 02:41:47,540
We too possess a heart and know
howto share the sorrow of others.

1734
02:41:53,710 --> 02:41:58,042
We'll reach there in time, won't we?
l fear it may be too late.

1735
02:41:58,779 --> 02:42:02,267
Do as l tell you. Phone your
beloved at the airport...

1736
02:42:02,711 --> 02:42:05,541
and say that you will be coming,
so she shouldn't board the flight.

1737
02:42:22,843 --> 02:42:24,399
May l have your attention, please.

1738
02:42:26,109 --> 02:42:30,803
Calling for passenger Ms Sapna.
Traveling on Boeing 707...

1739
02:42:31,275 --> 02:42:38,003
flight No. 113... please contact
ground staff. Thank you.

1740
02:42:46,842 --> 02:42:48,933
Hello, Sapna.
This is Sunder speaking.

1741
02:42:50,809 --> 02:42:54,639
l implore you not to cut the line.
lt's a question of life and death.

1742
02:42:55,409 --> 02:42:56,875
l have come from Bombay.

1743
02:42:57,275 --> 02:43:01,934
l didn't receive your letter.
Father had burnt it.

1744
02:43:04,175 --> 02:43:05,663
Sapna, l love you...

1745
02:43:06,008 --> 02:43:09,496
Dr. Banerjee told me that
you have misunderstood me.

1746
02:43:09,907 --> 02:43:13,101
My darling, you fool,
Seema is my sister-in-law!

1747
02:43:13,573 --> 02:43:15,596
She was carrying my brother's child.

1748
02:43:16,640 --> 02:43:18,105
lt was the question of her honor.

1749
02:43:18,673 --> 02:43:23,196
Father has accepted her now
and he wants to accept you also.

1750
02:43:23,507 --> 02:43:26,961
You don't knowthe pain my
family is enduring, to find you.

1751
02:43:27,406 --> 02:43:33,305
Sapna, if you go away, l'll die.
l love you, Sapna.

1752
02:43:33,572 --> 02:43:36,505
Give me your love.
l cannot live without you!

1753
02:43:38,940 --> 02:43:41,371
Do not board the plane.
l am coming to the Airport...

1754
02:44:02,371 --> 02:44:06,894
She didn't even hear me out,
inspector. She cut the line.

1755
02:44:07,605 --> 02:44:12,196
Don't worry. lf she really loves
you she will not board the plane.

1756
02:44:58,869 --> 02:45:05,699
l'm sorry, the flight has taken off.
- No problem. You did your best.

1757
02:45:06,567 --> 02:45:10,226
But l will search every corner
of the world for Sapna.

1758
02:45:32,367 --> 02:45:36,992
"My love for you shall always remain youthful..."

1759
02:45:37,300 --> 02:45:42,255
"it has always been... it will always be"
