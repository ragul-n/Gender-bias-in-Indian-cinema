00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:32,167
'Am I serving you just a glass of tea?
I'm promising you a customer along with it'

3
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:33,833
'Give me just 1 chance, bro'

4
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:35,417
Let's see

5
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:38,958
'How can you be so vague?
Give me a positive answer, bro'

6
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,958
How strange!
I got an empty message

7
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,708
'Who is he?'

8
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,958
'Sending empty messages to me
like boys generally do to girls'

9
00:02:16,792 --> 00:02:18,625
- Hello, Nagaraj
- Good morning, Sekar

10
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:21,875
'- Who is this boy?
- He's Gurumurthy I told you about'

11
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,083
Software Engineering?

12
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,917
I know Java, Icat very well

13
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:30,917
Bro, your degree is more important
to us than your language skills

14
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,083
Sit down

15
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,500
My dear boy
I need a favor from you

16
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:39,208
I want all the black money I've hoarded
changed into legal currency

17
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,000
What you have to do now is...

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,958
...open a new account

19
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,500
'This Friday evening...'

20
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,708
'...on the pretext you sold
software in America'

21
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,417
...5 million will be deposited
in your bank account

22
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,333
The reason being, if it is software,
it won't raise any eyebrows

23
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:55,250
The price is whatever we claim it to be

24
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:59,375
'After 2 weeks take 4.5 million 
from your account'

25
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:01,667
Transfer it to the account
I instruct you to

26
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,833
Remaining 0.5 million is all yours

27
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,250
You don't have to return it

28
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:09,625
'But as soon as you see this kind of cash
you shouldn't have a change of heart'

29
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:10,875
Do you get it?

30
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,917
You can wish for something
but not wish for the moon!

31
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,958
Take good care of your wife and children

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,208
Take him with you

33
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,000
'Okay, Sekar
Let us go'

34
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:39,708
"O' mind, chant the name of Lord Rama"

35
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,292
[indistinct chatter]

36
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:41,333
'Duck is waddling up to the baby'

37
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,500
'The duck bit the baby'

38
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:14,792
'Within 5 minutes of depositing the cash
he has hauled the entire 5 million'

39
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,042
Where's the money?

40
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,583
I swear I don't know

41
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,792
You don't know?

42
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,958
I'll give you grace time
until 9:00 p.m

43
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,375
If I don't get back the missing cash...

44
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:29,083
...forget your wife and child exist

45
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:30,458
9:00 p.m

46
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,167
'Listen, Guru'

47
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,917
'Whether you swindled
or you got scammed'

48
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,750
'...I have no clue'

49
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:44,625
'If you don't return the cash, you can 
see your wife and children as corpses'

50
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,125
What happened?
You're sweating all over

51
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,750
Elevator wasn't working

52
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,125
'Will you eat now?'

53
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,542
'I am making your favorite tomato chutney'

54
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,250
'I'll give you grace time
until 9:00 p.m'

55
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,583
'Take good care of your wife and children'

56
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:10,833
'Iron Curtain'

57
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:26,458
'By just using an app...'

58
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,250
'...even without your knowledge'

59
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,333
'...using your own camera
many events can be recorded!'

60
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,000
'Isn't that Chandru's girlfriend?'

61
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,000
Yes, she is stripping

62
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:38,875
In today's digital world...

63
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,417
...there's no place for the word 'privacy'

64
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,833
All our day to day activities
are being recorded

65
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:50,000
'Yesterday my Facebook page
had so many links on Goa'

66
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:54,167
How does the Facebook chap know
whatever I chatted on WhatsApp?

67
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,250
Madam, I'm coming to your area

68
00:07:58,292 --> 00:07:59,833
Where should I come exactly?

69
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:02,167
'I have shared 'Live' location
on WhatsApp for you'

70
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:14,708
'My whereabouts can be easily tracked
by the GPS in my smart phone'

71
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,833
'Do you know how many
have your number stored?'

72
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,208
'May be around 300 people'

73
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,625
'Your number is stored without even
your knowledge by 3 million people'

74
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,750
'Are you serious?'

75
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:26,875
'The virus 'Android banker' has attacked...'

76
00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:30,667
'...232 banking softwares
which have been listed'

77
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:34,042
'An ATM card has 16 digits
as serial number'

78
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,792
'If you submit the number
your card gets renewed'

79
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,208
'Nowadays if you pay just Rs 500'

80
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,250
...you can get 10,000 details
about Aadhar card

81
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,000
'I wonder where she's from!'

82
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,167
- I'm Kathiravan
- 'Jack in the box!'

83
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,125
- Maria Ignatius
- Hi, Gnyanavel

84
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:03,375
'Look at the Jack in the box again!'

85
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let us converse in Tamil

86
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,458
That's even more convenient!

87
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:19,333
But it's inconvenient for me

88
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:21,750
Shall I leave now?
Make it easier for both of you

89
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:25,917
'Tearing hurry!'

90
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,833
'Get lost, you white maid!'

91
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,917
Listen, we'll get drunk tonight and
stuff ourselves with gourmet food

92
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,833
Because for 1 more year
we are stuck with military canteen

93
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,250
Why are you so desperate?

94
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,375
Every Thursday we get rationed liquor

95
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,167
Did you see the bar?
So many 'figures'?

96
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,958
Yuck! Don't deride ladies like that!

97
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,542
They are here as tourists
Treat them with some respect

98
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,292
Look at that chap over there
He's disgracing our entire nation!

99
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,708
That chap in a floral shirt?

100
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,792
Ditto

101
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:03,542
Let's get married in a church

102
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,917
Shall we get married?

103
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,500
Instead of that
according to your culture...

104
00:11:09,542 --> 00:11:11,458
...in bodyguard Muniswaran temple

105
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,458
...if we get married and settle down
in Mylapore, it would be awesome

106
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,417
- In Mylapore?
- Yes

107
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,792
Awesome...?

108
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:19,875
It will be awful!

109
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:20,958
'How stupid of me!'

110
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,125
For you to settle here,
should I settle your bill?

111
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:25,833
Hey, give my bill also to her
You stay in Mylapore!

112
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,250
- I am Gnyanavel
- So be it!

113
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,833
Bro, please sit
I want 2 minutes of your time

114
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,958
Even though you snatched
my booty from under my nose

115
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,875
...why are you ditching
such a classy looking miss?

116
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,417
Mr Gnyanavel, I didn't flirt
because she's beautiful or fair

117
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,875
She's a foreigner

118
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:45,167
Do you wish to go abroad?

119
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,833
Not just a wish
My entire goal

120
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,583
Foreign places lure you so much?

121
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,792
I don't like staying here

122
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:53,000
Only population is 'Made in India' here
Everything else is 'Made abroad'

123
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,625
People here want to ape
those who live abroad

124
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:58,208
But I want to live abroad all my life

125
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,333
This is true ambition

126
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:02,708
That's my drin-
It's alright

127
00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:05,083
- Are you married?
- No, bro

128
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,583
Then she's the girl for you

129
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:09,708
I'll continue

130
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,958
Maria, will you come home?
I live in Mylapore!

131
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,208
Why does my name make
all the females run a mile?

132
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,667
Won't she think he's a Casanova?

133
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,125
They must be good friends

134
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:26,958
- I'm leaving
- Don't be mad at me

135
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Drink...drink

136
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:33,833
Look at him now

137
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,208
SIT DOWN!

138
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,458
Fine, let him disturb 1 more girl

139
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,708
I'll deal with him, okay?

140
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:43,667
- Confirmed...?
- Confirmed, I will ask him

141
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,500
Do you know you're talking
to a military man?

142
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:00,750
From Velu Military Hotel?

143
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:02,458
How dare you retort!

144
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:06,792
Get up, man

145
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,542
Hey! What the hell is your problem?

146
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,500
He had the gall to shove me aside!

147
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:11,583
Bash him up

148
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,083
He still goes back to that chick

149
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,625
- What is your problem?
- Punch him right on his face

150
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,833
If you dare flirt with a foreigner-

151
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,792
Our guest is God

152
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:28,542
'Did he drink too much?
Huddled in a corner quietly'

153
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,750
Kathir...?

154
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:31,167
My dear nephew

155
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:33,875
What happened to you?

156
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,000
You've been pounded to a pulp, eh?

157
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:37,333
Don't scream

158
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:40,583
If this bar owner Dubai Sekar
gets to know what happened...

159
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:42,750
...he'll tie you up in a desert
and castrate you!

160
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:45,000
All the time obsessing
about foreign 'items'!

161
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:46,667
Uncle...?

162
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,833
How can I go abroad
without a passport?

163
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:52,042
So I have no other choice
but to fall in love with a foreign chick

164
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,625
I know it's difficult to
fall in love with the girls here

165
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,458
But getting married to them is very easy

166
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,417
Whereas foreign girls
are easier to fall in love

167
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,500
But marrying them is a herculean task

168
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:03,833
To stun my father and you...

169
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,833
...if I don't marry Amy Jackson-

170
00:14:05,917 --> 00:14:08,500
You must resemble
Michael Jackson to do so!

171
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,583
Your temper dangles at your nose tip
That's why they aimed at your nose

172
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,667
Your father is calling
Talk to him

173
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,125
- Tell me
- Listen

174
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:19,500
Your sister Selvi met with
an accident, her leg is injured

175
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:21,083
I need Rs 5000 immediately

176
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:22,625
Is that right?

177
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:23,875
Let me talk to Selvi

178
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:26,083
She...she is taking some medicine

179
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,167
Is that so?

180
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,417
Let me speak to the doctor

181
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,458
He's the one administering
the medicine to her

182
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,667
Nurse, compounder, watchman
Give the phone to someone there

183
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,250
Don't you trust me, son?

184
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,708
You are one person
I'll never trust in this world

185
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:40,250
Hang up now

186
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,167
Did he buy your story?

187
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,917
Your brother doesn't love you one bit

188
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,917
'I tried to make him
send us some cash'

189
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,875
Treat your father 
with a little more respect

190
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:54,792
If he borrows money all over the place
no one will respect him, including his son

191
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:57,042
I've sent him the money
for this month too

192
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,000
Is it enough if you give him money?

193
00:14:59,042 --> 00:15:00,458
When did you last visit him?

194
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,375
It's your home
She's your sister

195
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:03,417
Home!

196
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,292
Your sister
That is my mother

197
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,000
I lost everything
when she passed away

198
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:08,417
What's left is only the address

199
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,333
If he was really fond of me
he should have showered love on me

200
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,833
Instead he admitted me
in a military school

201
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:15,792
Not even once has he thought of me

202
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,042
I know uncle Rangu loves you

203
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,458
Stop singing his praises

204
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,208
- Pour me another glass
- I won't

205
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,667
I'm feeling sleepy

206
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,292
When they hit you, why didn't you say
you're from Madurai too?

207
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,625
They didn't give me a chance

208
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:28,375
They went hammer and tongs at me

209
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:29,875
That's why you should drink less!

210
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:33,125
But tomorrow if I don't suffer
from a hangover...

211
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:34,750
...everything will be forgotten

212
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:37,167
All their faces will be a blur
Then what can you do?

213
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,833
He wears shades at this hour!
Is he a fan of director Mysskin?

214
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,167
"He is a detective"

215
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:43,458
You bet I will

216
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,458
To ensure every one of you passes out
as a well trained officer...

217
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,833
...we have assembled here

218
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:50,958
In just 1 year

219
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,958
To train you...

220
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:02,042
Major Kathiravan!

221
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,958
"He's out to grab you by your collar"

222
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,875
"He is coming to threaten you, holler"

223
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:24,833
You'll be reporting to him
the whole of this year

224
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:27,958
Long live India!

225
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,833
"He's out to get you
Aiyaiyaiyo!"

226
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,542
In the 2nd file

227
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,375
3rd person

228
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,042
Step out

229
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:55,625
3rd file 1st person, step out

230
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,875
'Thank God!
No one snitched about me'

231
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:13,042
3rd file 4th man
You missed him

232
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,708
' - Traitor!
- Step out, my dear'

233
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,208
Didn't I warn you right then?

234
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,083
I kept repeating
not to thrash me

235
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,208
By the way

236
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:31,417
Who targeted my legs?

237
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,708
- Aim at his leg
- He has such huge feet

238
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,667
Come here

239
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,542
Lift your leg

240
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,333
Hop like this
100 rounds

241
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,458
Go on

242
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:48,208
Who aimed at my shoulder?

243
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,042
This blackie wants a white girl?!

244
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,667
Sit down

245
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:58,500
100 rounds

246
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,458
I can turn a blind eye even to this

247
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,833
But one chap rolled
and punched my stomach

248
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,667
'Bhai, roll and stamp him'

249
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,583
He's the one

250
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:08,042
Your turn

251
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,625
Roll the same way

252
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,125
100 rounds

253
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:13,208
Get lost!

254
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:16,375
I didn't touch you at all, sir

255
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,458
You're the stunt coordinator, right?

256
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,083
That's the way
Drag him here

257
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,583
Whom are you acting smart with?

258
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:25,250
Your task

259
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,208
There are 2000 personnel
in this camp

260
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,625
To each and every one of them

261
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:30,500
Wish 'goodnight' in the morning

262
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,083
'Good evening' at noon

263
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,667
'Good morning' at night

264
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,250
Everything is wrong timing, sir

265
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,458
You change it

266
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,250
Not just 1 day

267
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,250
365 days!

268
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,125
Clear out now

269
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,750
"Hey! Ready
Rapid action, buddy"

270
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,417
"Like thunder, his grip so steady"

271
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,875
"Salute daily"

272
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:12,375
"To badger, browbeat, bully
He's out to get you only"

273
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:15,250
"Hey! Retaliate immediately"

274
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,833
"Act, close his chapter duly"

275
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:19,583
"Or else die inevitably"

276
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,250
"He's out to get you, buddy
Aiyaiyo! He's here, already"

277
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,625
"A bullet he'll hand you
to brush your teeth, dude"

278
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:27,042
"If hungry, landmine he'll serve anew"

279
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,125
"Not iffy, in a jiffy
he'll make you tizzy"

280
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,917
"In a split second ruthlessly
he'll detonate a bomb recklessly"

281
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,250
"He'll size you up in his mind clearly"

282
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,750
"He'll change half your habits cleverly"

283
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:41,125
"He will resemble Yama, lord of death
He'll give you a new birth on this earth"

284
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,958
"Hey! Ready
Power play, buddy"

285
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,875
"Like thunder, his grip so steady"

286
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:48,458
Salute daily"

287
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,542
"To talk, stalk, threaten you truly
He's out to get you only"

288
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,292
"If you're a brave soldier
he'll give you an armor"

289
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,667
"If you get cold feet
he'll torture you complete"

290
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,625
"Shoot a border around your heart neat"

291
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:29,458
"Wild and wired, he'll swirl you
Watch you spin dizzy, dude"

292
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,833
"When you get tired
and about to slide"

293
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,167
"He'll switch on the timer, woe betide!"

294
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,292
"When numb with pain and calloused"

295
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,833
"Till then we'll be abused
He'll be ever so amused"

296
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:42,917
"With utmost concern, dude
into a tanker he'll lift you"

297
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,333
"On your mark and that's it"

298
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:48,333
"He'll make death pay you a sudden visit"

299
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:51,292
"Hey! Ready
Rapid fire, buddy"

300
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,875
"Like thunder, his grip so steady"

301
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,625
"Salute daily"

302
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:58,000
"To badger, browbeat, bully
He's out to get you only"

303
00:20:58,042 --> 00:21:00,833
"Hey! Retaliate immediately"

304
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,667
"Act, close his chapter duly"

305
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,167
"Or else die inevitably"

306
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:13,875
[humming]

307
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:17,458
Hey, uncle
Whose child is this?

308
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,917
- Running a nursery now?
- Not at all

309
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:20,958
My neighbor's kid

310
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,208
I am baby-sitting

311
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,083
Whole world knows you are jobless, huh?

312
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:27,167
Don't even ask!

313
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,292
Her father committed suicide last week

314
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,458
What are you saying?

315
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,042
Every house in Chennai has a TV, fridge,
washing machine, you name it, they have it

316
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,167
Not a single household
has 10 paise to spend

317
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,708
It all works on credit card it seems

318
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,250
Same story with her father too!

319
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:42,208
He couldn't repay
and jumped to his death

320
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,042
Her mother has gone to claim insurance

321
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,208
Hold her for a second
I'll turn off the cooker

322
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,333
I'll be right back

323
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,292
- Amma...?
- Your amma will be back

324
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,750
If only I was married
wifey will do all this!

325
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:55,333
Don't cry, sweetheart
Your mom will be back soon

326
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,208
Which is Guru's apartment?

327
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,208
Adjacent to this

328
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:04,250
It is locked
No one at home?

329
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,667
She is expected now

330
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,625
Sir, that suicide case Guru

331
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:10,917
'He jumped to his death
and he's killing us now'

332
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,250
Yes, I'll come back to the office

333
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:17,500
Sir, I'll call you back

334
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,167
- Are you Mrs Gurumurthy?
- Yes, sir

335
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,500
How many times to call you?

336
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,875
- Won't you pick up my call?
- No, sir

337
00:22:26,917 --> 00:22:29,833
When your husband jumped
did he die with his phone?

338
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:32,708
When you borrow
you flash all your teeth, right?

339
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,042
- Not like that, sir
- What do you mean by that?

340
00:22:35,042 --> 00:22:36,417
'First pay our dues'

341
00:22:36,542 --> 00:22:38,125
House bought on loan

342
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,417
Car on loan

343
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,417
Do you have any property
in your hometown?

344
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:42,625
No, sir

345
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,333
Then why do you even borrow?

346
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,542
- Sir, everyone is watching us
- Let them

347
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,042
If you give me 2 months-

348
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,875
Your husband pleaded
for time and died

349
00:22:49,917 --> 00:22:51,208
Now you want to buy time too

350
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,833
'If you also die, 
how will I get my money back?'

351
00:22:53,917 --> 00:22:55,125
Open the door

352
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,875
Standing still like a statue?

353
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,708
'If you show me a sad face
you think I'll write off your debt?'

354
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,000
'Open the door, I say'

355
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:03,083
'Better open the door
or you'll be humiliated here'

356
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,042
Why are you hitting me?

357
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:06,292
Who are you?

358
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,000
I am just doing my job

359
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:11,250
Do you call this a job?

360
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:15,042
Borrowing 90 billion
in 5 or 6 banks...

361
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:18,417
...Vijay Mallya is happily
sightseeing abroad

362
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:20,583
You don't have the guts to ask him
Clear out now

363
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:24,042
From people whose livelihood depends
on agriculture, people in rented houses

364
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,458
From auto drivers

365
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:28,958
You'll collect dues at high interest
from those borrowing to study

366
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:30,250
Get up, man

367
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:32,083
Collecting dues by threatening

368
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:35,083
It isn't even wrong on your part
to collect your dues

369
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:39,917
But you started this habit of
hounding people with nonstop calls

370
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:41,375
That's your major blunder

371
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:45,125
Hey listen, I'm a military officer

372
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:47,292
If I see you again in this area...

373
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:50,125
...I'll stuff a gun into your mouth
and pull the trigger, clear out

374
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:51,417
My bike?

375
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:54,625
Only you'll seize bikes, huh?

376
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,333
My bike!

377
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:57,875
- Get lost!
- God help me

378
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,167
Got a fax

379
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,042
What's all this?

380
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:23,917
With no control whatsoever

381
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:27,833
Forgetting the fact you are a military
training officer, you're going overboard

382
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,292
Thank God no one took a video of you
thrashing that fellow in public

383
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,208
Why do you lose control like this?

384
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,042
An ordinary sub inspector is
bombarding me with questions!

385
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:38,583
He faxed a complaint
along with your photo

386
00:24:39,917 --> 00:24:41,708
This is your 6th apology to me!

387
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,625
I'll give you 6 weeks grace time

388
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:50,958
In that time frame, consult
a Govt authorized psychologist

389
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:54,542
Complete a session on Anger Management
and show me the certificate

390
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:57,125
Only then I'll let you
enter this academy

391
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:05,250
'When will you find a bride for me?
Don't you want an aunt in your life?'

392
00:25:05,292 --> 00:25:07,292
'You'll apply the brake
if I broach this topic'

393
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:09,333
Your doctor won't be available

394
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:15,042
His name is Kathir
He needs to consult the doctor

395
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:16,417
Hang up now

396
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:20,208
Dr Rathidevi will see you
Please wait over there

397
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,458
Rathidevi...?

398
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:24,333
Her name sounds antiquated!

399
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:25,708
Let's wait, uncle

400
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:31,125
'What's that strange sound?'

401
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:32,625
'Good heavens!'

402
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,708
Any problem with your body?

403
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,833
Tell me, sir

404
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:43,042
No problem at all

405
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,750
I can help you solve your problem

406
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:47,042
I am a little short fused

407
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:51,042
As it is, exhaling is a tough task

408
00:25:51,042 --> 00:25:53,000
On top of it you lose your temper too!

409
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:54,833
You seem to be the epitome of serenity

410
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:56,833
Expect me to believe
you're short tempered?

411
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:59,167
I am human too
Do you hear me?

412
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:00,542
Why shouldn't I get angry?

413
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:03,042
Why do you lose your cool
given your body condition?

414
00:26:03,042 --> 00:26:04,667
You mean to say
you are fit as a fiddle

415
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:06,208
I'm one step away from my grave!

416
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,292
You'll live long and
I'll die anytime now

417
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,750
Isn't that what you are hinting?

418
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:12,417
You are like clay that can be moulded
Why raise your voice?

419
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:14,167
- Am I putty in your hands?
- Yes

420
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:16,083
Do I come across as a powerless puny?

421
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:18,792
Want to see me unleash
the power of my cusswords?

422
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:20,167
No need, sir

423
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:22,917
[unintelligible ranting]

424
00:26:28,792 --> 00:26:31,083
'He lets out a string of cusswords!'

425
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:36,250
We've been here for an hour, I didn't know
which crackpot will crack me where

426
00:26:36,292 --> 00:26:38,167
How will you last here
for 6 long weeks?

427
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,208
Who intends being
cooped here for 6 weeks?

428
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,625
You go bring all the forms
required for 6 weeks

429
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,792
We'll get all the forms signed
in one shot and leave

430
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:47,042
- Are you joking?
- Leave for 6 weeks!

431
00:26:47,042 --> 00:26:48,625
Superb, my dear nephew

432
00:26:48,792 --> 00:26:50,375
- Who is this?
- Rathidevi

433
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:52,042
Our doctor is an antique!

434
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:55,125
Doctor, his name is Kathir

435
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:56,542
He is terribly short fused

436
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:58,167
Please check him thoroughly

437
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:00,375
Is she hard of hearing?

438
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,000
Doctor, his name is Kathir

439
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:07,458
He gets mad at the drop of a hat
Check him thoroughly

440
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:12,542
Doctor, he is short tempered

441
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:14,667
- Check him
- Go away, I'm busy

442
00:27:15,042 --> 00:27:17,792
She's the maid
Let's go

443
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:21,042
She tries her best to clean and
I gave her a clean chit as the doctor!

444
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:24,958
Madam, 2 loony cases are
bugging me, please come

445
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:35,750
Going by the doctor's name I thought
she'll be a rickety gramophone

446
00:27:35,792 --> 00:27:37,875
But she looks like a trendy Instagram!

447
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:39,875
It's a general opinion, my dear nephew!

448
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:42,458
'Here she is'

449
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,042
Which one of you is Kathiravan?

450
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:45,250
One sitting next to me

451
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:46,458
Lanky 6 footer

452
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:47,625
He's Kathir

453
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,542
Do you know about your report?

454
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:52,542
You'll receive only reports about him

455
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:55,042
Do you get angry easily?

456
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:56,833
That's all he gets!

457
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:00,958
Sir, just a bit

458
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:05,667
Yes, my dear Rathi

459
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:08,375
I think you suffer
from a nervous problem

460
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:10,375
How did you find out?

461
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:13,208
You don't know how to zip your lips!

462
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:17,042
Shall I recommend
a good doctor for you?

463
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I heard it too

464
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:22,792
Will you deal with her?

465
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:26,042
'Rathi, what a conspiracy!'

466
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:28,125
Yes, Kathir

467
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,833
Why do you lose your temper?

468
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,167
To get boiling mad
at an unjust act is human

469
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:35,625
But those who stand around
like zombies, numb and emotionless

470
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:37,417
They are the coma patients!

471
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:40,083
You want me to be a coma patient

472
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,458
I prefer being a humane being!

473
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,583
Nothing wrong in getting mad
at an unjust act

474
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:47,500
But bashing him up was wrong

475
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:52,125
You don't have to point out
right from wrong

476
00:28:52,292 --> 00:28:53,458
I'm not saying it

477
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,375
Your senior officer said so
and made you consult me

478
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:58,417
Senior officer will say so

479
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:00,833
He has no choice
because it's a formality

480
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:04,625
I have no option but to land up here
Because that's also a formality

481
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:06,917
These forms for 6 weeks

482
00:29:07,042 --> 00:29:08,583
Also a formality!

483
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,292
If you sign them...

484
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:13,042
...I'll finish all the formalities
and bid you farewell!

485
00:29:16,542 --> 00:29:18,958
Everything has a formality, Kathir

486
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:22,750
I can't sign without
analyzing your mental health

487
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:24,125
Am I a lunatic?

488
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:25,833
Do I look like a mental case?

489
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:28,083
I never categorized you as such

490
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:29,625
You're showing your mad side

491
00:29:31,042 --> 00:29:33,167
At this young age
how experienced are you?

492
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:34,458
What have you seen in life?

493
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:37,042
Will you know everything
if you flip a few pages?

494
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:39,250
Do you know how much
I've suffered in life?

495
00:29:39,292 --> 00:29:41,125
Do you know what I have experienced?

496
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,458
You can't analyze me

497
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:45,750
Just shut up and
sign on the dotted lines

498
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:49,375
You're a good trainer

499
00:29:49,417 --> 00:29:52,125
So you're capable of molding
recruits into good soldiers

500
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,875
Good human being

501
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:58,458
That's why you react to
all the wrongdoings around you

502
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:01,417
I'm mad at you even now

503
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:03,708
But did I react wrongly?

504
00:30:05,042 --> 00:30:06,417
This isn't your ground

505
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:08,333
...for me to obey your instructions

506
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:10,375
6 weeks

507
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:12,667
Come here happily
like a college student

508
00:30:12,708 --> 00:30:14,458
'I'll sign then for sure'

509
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:18,333
The day you talk to me
for 1 hour without losing your cool...

510
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:20,583
'...only then I'll sign your form'

511
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:22,750
Till then you must mark
your attendance here

512
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,125
This is for you

513
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:29,083
Whenever you're upset
press this stress ball

514
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:31,375
Count from 1 to 10
Your anger will recede

515
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,000
Good afternoon, sir

516
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:46,333
'Ready with the cash?'

517
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:49,042
The amount you expect
is not feasible, sir

518
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:50,667
Less than that is not viable

519
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,292
'Kindly adjust, sir'

520
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:55,250
This amount is way too much
to tear just 4 pages

521
00:30:55,292 --> 00:30:57,625
This case has been dealt
by 5 sub inspectors, sir

522
00:30:57,667 --> 00:30:59,958
You won't face any problem
because of this, sir

523
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:04,333
What is it, sir?

524
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:06,083
Hesitating to do something wrong?

525
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:07,875
I'm thinking
how to do it right

526
00:31:07,917 --> 00:31:09,958
Does it mean you are
okay with the deal?

527
00:31:14,792 --> 00:31:18,042
'Tell your brother to deposit the cash
in my account before 12 noon on Friday'

528
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,042
'Okay, sir'

529
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:20,042
'Otherwise-'

530
00:31:20,042 --> 00:31:21,417
'I will take care of it, sir'

531
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:36,417
Today is the very 1st session

532
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:38,583
Let's talk about what you like most

533
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,875
Kathir, I'm asking you

534
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:45,250
You are so quiet

535
00:31:45,292 --> 00:31:47,917
Didn't you tell me if I control
my anger for an hour...

536
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:49,625
...you'll sign the form

537
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,333
You do the talking

538
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:52,667
Only that's safe

539
00:31:52,792 --> 00:31:55,167
Sure, I'll talk and
you keep listening

540
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:56,750
Listen, Kathir

541
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:59,708
We react quickly to events
happening around us

542
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:03,250
If the same had happened
at an age when we couldn't react?

543
00:32:03,292 --> 00:32:06,042
'An unpardonable fury
will stagnate in our mind'

544
00:32:06,042 --> 00:32:08,542
'That's called unforgiveness hook'

545
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:11,250
'Unable to forgive, the fury
harbored within ourselves...'

546
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:12,708
'...will change to a hook'

547
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,833
The only way to escape
from that hook is...

548
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:16,208
...to forget that anger

549
00:32:16,292 --> 00:32:17,833
'And be able to forgive'

550
00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:21,542
Have you been to Paris?

551
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Yes

552
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:24,083
Why...?

553
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:26,083
To see my sister

554
00:32:26,792 --> 00:32:28,458
Is this your sister?

555
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:33,083
What does your sister do?

556
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:34,792
She's a dentist

557
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:40,458
What's your sister's name?

558
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,917
Saroja Devi!

559
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:47,125
Is your sister married?

560
00:32:47,167 --> 00:32:48,625
Why do you need all those details?

561
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:50,042
I'm just making small talk

562
00:32:50,042 --> 00:32:51,833
- Is she married?
- Not yet

563
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,708
Your task is to ensure I don't get angry

564
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,583
My wish list is to leave this country

565
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:01,042
Both our goals coincide

566
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:05,083
Let's say your house is in Kilpauk

567
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:07,208
If you're travelling
from Kilpauk to Mandavelli...

568
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,625
...is it possible for you not
to get angry for 5 seconds?

569
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:10,708
Impossible!

570
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,042
Auto driver will try to cut across
Bus driver will overtake

571
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:15,458
Pedestrians will walk
in the middle of the road

572
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:19,083
From politicians to jobless jerks
it's corruption, jealousy, arbitration

573
00:33:19,792 --> 00:33:22,667
How is it possible to
keep my anger in check?

574
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:26,833
But if I leave this country
I won't get angry even for a second

575
00:33:27,042 --> 00:33:29,542
If both our objectives
have to succeed...

576
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:31,417
...there's only one way

577
00:33:32,292 --> 00:33:34,000
Hook me on to Saroja Devi

578
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:37,042
What are you saying?
I'm here to counsel you

579
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:38,708
Not to set you up with my sister

580
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,875
How can you lose your temper?

581
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:42,333
You should-

582
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:46,208
This is called a stress ball

583
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,417
Hold this in your hand

584
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:50,625
If you count from 1 to 10 and press it
your anger will vanish into thin air

585
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:52,250
My doctor's advice!

586
00:33:54,792 --> 00:33:56,250
See you in our next session

587
00:33:56,292 --> 00:33:58,417
Convey my greetings to Saroja Devi

588
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:11,083
Cash deposited

589
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:12,958
Yov! Shut the door

590
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:25,917
Today's lunch smells delicious
Where did you get it from?

591
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:27,375
Our Akim's shop, sir

592
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,125
How much does he earn per day?

593
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:32,083
More than 40k

594
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:34,625
He earns so much and
won't grease our palms, huh?

595
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:37,083
All he does is fill our tummy, that's all

596
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:39,958
He'll come around only if he gets 
a taste of your medicine

597
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,708
Go out

598
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,917
- Sir, is your part of the deal over?
- Hey! Are you cheating me?

599
00:34:50,042 --> 00:34:52,000
Trying to cheat me
by not depositing cash?

600
00:34:52,042 --> 00:34:54,000
Sir, we've deposited money
into your account

601
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:56,458
- You must have been notified
- Yes, I was

602
00:34:56,542 --> 00:34:59,250
5 minutes after I got the message
the money went missing!

603
00:34:59,292 --> 00:35:00,750
Don't play the fool, sir

604
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:02,583
Money went missing from your account

605
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,000
We kept our side of the deal

606
00:35:04,042 --> 00:35:05,667
It is your job to check

607
00:35:08,042 --> 00:35:09,042
Tell me, sir

608
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:12,000
Arivu, 2.5 million is
missing from my account

609
00:35:12,042 --> 00:35:13,042
Are you serious, sir?

610
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:14,792
Hackers tampered with a police account?

611
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:16,792
Sir, please forward a complaint

612
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:18,167
I'll trace it for you

613
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:19,833
I can't register a complaint

614
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:21,167
This money has no source

615
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:22,833
Different account!
Try to understand

616
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:24,542
Send me your account details

617
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:26,583
I'll trace the miscreant and call you

618
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,125
- Got him?
- We got him, sir

619
00:35:37,417 --> 00:35:39,875
This is his phone number
We've traced his IP address too

620
00:35:39,917 --> 00:35:41,375
He's within city limits

621
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:42,667
Call him

622
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:58,375
What gall to lay your hands
on a police officer's account?

623
00:35:58,417 --> 00:36:00,667
I'll give you 24 hours grace time

624
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:05,750
You had better deposit the 2.5 million
you flicked from my account

625
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:09,042
'Aren't you a police officer of repute?'

626
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:12,042
'Then instead of arresting me
why are you resorting to this?'

627
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:13,625
Are you kidding me?

628
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,708
I know you live in Pallavaram, right?

629
00:36:15,792 --> 00:36:17,042
I'll come there

630
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:18,458
I'll nab you right there

631
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,167
'Am I in Pallavaram?'

632
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:23,583
'Ask your cybercrime experts
to refresh their screens'

633
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:28,833
'Where am I now?'

634
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:30,833
Pondicherry...?

635
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,833
'Ask them to refresh again'

636
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:36,125
'Where am I now?'

637
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:37,167
Cuddalore...!

638
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:40,583
'Can I go from Pondicherry
to Cuddalore in half a second?'

639
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:43,625
'What I flicked from you is money
you got from an illegal source'

640
00:36:43,667 --> 00:36:45,708
'Now the current balance is your salary'

641
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:50,792
'Rs 244435.25'

642
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:53,125
'Every second from now
that you don't hang-up...'

643
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:55,625
'...I'll take 10,000 from your account
Do you want that?'

644
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:57,167
Are you playing the fool?

645
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:05,833
'Hang up now, you slimeball!'

646
00:37:16,042 --> 00:37:17,583
Why didn't you attend my session?

647
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:19,042
'How are you?'

648
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,583
- What...?
- That's French

649
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:23,958
- I'm coming from French class
- Is this your punctuality?

650
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,417
Is this an ideal place for a session?

651
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:27,042
The noise around here is deafening

652
00:37:27,042 --> 00:37:28,042
I can't handle it

653
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:30,208
You will only talk
in a session, right?

654
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,292
For a change...

655
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,042
...why don't we walk and talk?

656
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:38,583
Then...what's up?

657
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,083
How is your sister?

658
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:43,042
Did you tell her about me?

659
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:46,500
Let's play a game

660
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:49,333
- Game...?
- Quid pro quo

661
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:50,458
What...?

662
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:53,125
I must answer
whatever question you ask me

663
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:56,042
The same rule applies to you

664
00:37:56,125 --> 00:37:57,542
Can I ask you anything?

665
00:37:58,333 --> 00:37:59,458
Go ahead

666
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:01,417
But the reply should be honest

667
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:04,750
I'll find out if you lie to me

668
00:38:04,792 --> 00:38:06,000
That's fine

669
00:38:06,042 --> 00:38:08,125
But I get to ask you the 1st question

670
00:38:09,292 --> 00:38:10,833
Have you ever fallen in love?

671
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,875
What's the connection
between that and the game?

672
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:18,042
You said I can ask any question

673
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:19,542
Please reply honestly

674
00:38:21,042 --> 00:38:22,375
Maybe...

675
00:38:22,542 --> 00:38:24,708
...I would've fallen in love
with 12 men so far

676
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:26,917
Who...?

677
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:28,000
You...?

678
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,083
12 men

679
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:32,542
Though I was downright rude to you...

680
00:38:32,583 --> 00:38:34,375
...how softly you dealt with me

681
00:38:34,417 --> 00:38:36,417
Would you have ditched 12 men?

682
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:38,250
Even if he had ditched you...

683
00:38:38,292 --> 00:38:41,792
...to walk away from a girl like you
he should be a prize fool!

684
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:43,125
Don't lay it on thick

685
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:45,833
As far as I know, you wouldn't
have fallen in love with anyone

686
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:47,292
You are a psychiatrist

687
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:48,417
You shouldn't lie

688
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,042
What is the source of this anger?

689
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:56,042
Have you watched rugby?

690
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,292
I've been playing rugby
right from my childhood

691
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:00,833
Entire violence enmasse
entered my body

692
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:02,125
And changed into anger

693
00:39:02,167 --> 00:39:03,583
I'm unable to control it

694
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:06,042
How many players are in a rugby team?

695
00:39:06,083 --> 00:39:07,167
Goal keeper

696
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:09,375
11 including the opening batsman

697
00:39:11,042 --> 00:39:13,417
I would've believed you
even if you had said Kabbadi

698
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:14,917
- If I had said so
- 'Who is that?'

699
00:39:14,958 --> 00:39:16,042
1 minute

700
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:19,125
Let's go

701
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:21,417
Does your sister prefer
a regular safe bet?

702
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:25,500
Or does she like a vigilante
rough and tough guy like me?

703
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:30,708
All I do is advise for 6 weeks
in cool comfort in an air-conditioned room

704
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,792
She's a human rights activist

705
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,167
She will imprison those who indulge
in public violence for minimum 6 years

706
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,250
Is your sister
a human rights activist?

707
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:46,458
Why do you get mad at people
who lend or borrow money?

708
00:39:47,042 --> 00:39:49,458
Have you ever borrowed
1000 bucks from anyone?

709
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:52,042
When he lends money,
even if he's a friend...

710
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:54,292
...he will part with it
as if it is his life

711
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:56,542
Do you know how painful it can be?

712
00:39:57,125 --> 00:39:59,125
Only money takes pride of place

713
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:01,667
Even if a pauper
recharges for just Rs 10...

714
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:03,125
...he is taxed Rs 4

715
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:05,917
If a wealthy man tops up his phone
he gets full talk time

716
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:07,833
That's the present state of our country

717
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:10,083
Atrocious attitude of the money lender

718
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:13,083
The disgrace a borrower faces
This is what bothers me

719
00:40:13,167 --> 00:40:15,583
Only if you've borrowed
will you know that anguish

720
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:17,167
Because of my father...

721
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:19,167
...our family also experienced that pain

722
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,750
'Every son will wish to be
hoisted on his father's shoulder'

723
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:24,333
'I wished the same too'

724
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:26,292
'But when my father
saw moneylenders...'

725
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:28,000
'...he started hiding behind me'

726
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:30,583
Kathir, don't tell him I'm here

727
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:35,042
'Rangasamy anna?'

728
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:41,333
'Are you at home,
Rangasamy anna?'

729
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:43,750
Kathir, call your father

730
00:40:43,792 --> 00:40:45,500
I don't know where my father is, uncle

731
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:47,208
'Call your mother then'

732
00:40:48,042 --> 00:40:49,667
Isn't your husband at home?

733
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:51,875
5 or 6 months ago
he borrowed Rs 5000 from me

734
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:54,375
'But he's been hiding and
running away from me'

735
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:56,708
'I have no hopes
he'll ever repay me'

736
00:40:56,792 --> 00:41:00,000
Listen, I don't want to be cursed
for snatching your wedding chain

737
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,292
'You remove it by yourself
and give it to me'

738
00:41:23,958 --> 00:41:25,208
Not only then

739
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:28,667
He hasn't changed one bit till date

740
00:41:31,875 --> 00:41:34,417
Till now I've never shared
this slice of me with anyone

741
00:41:39,292 --> 00:41:41,125
But this game of yours is simply superb

742
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:44,208
You handled me so well
and prised the truth out of me

743
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:54,917
- What?
- Shhhhh!

744
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,708
What is it?

745
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:28,125
Isn't it a delight to watch?
Birds, trees, sun's glory

746
00:42:29,292 --> 00:42:30,875
Nature at her best is all around us

747
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:32,917
We don't appreciate nature's splendor

748
00:42:32,958 --> 00:42:36,667
Your problem isn't
what you see, Kathir

749
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:38,292
But how you perceive it

750
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,375
Have you ever missed your family?

751
00:42:44,167 --> 00:42:45,750
My family doesn't need me

752
00:42:45,792 --> 00:42:48,167
They are fine as long as
I send them money every month

753
00:42:48,167 --> 00:42:50,917
I haven't spent that kind of time
for them to miss me

754
00:42:51,292 --> 00:42:52,417
Alright

755
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:55,250
How much would you
have earned till now?

756
00:42:55,542 --> 00:43:00,125
Didn't it even occur to you to
retrieve your mother's sacred thread?

757
00:43:01,375 --> 00:43:02,792
Shall I tell you a fact?

758
00:43:03,292 --> 00:43:05,500
You're as much a coward as your father

759
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,333
Your father ran away
from his creditors

760
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:12,000
You're running away from
your personal life and responsibilities

761
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,375
You must search only in the place
you lost something, Kathir

762
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:19,167
Go home
Talk to your father

763
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:22,000
'Don't run away from anyone, pa'

764
00:43:22,042 --> 00:43:24,042
'I am there for you'
Assure him with these words

765
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:25,875
Spend time with your younger sister

766
00:43:25,917 --> 00:43:27,167
This isn't a request

767
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:32,250
You're going home for 30 days
and spending time with your family

768
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:34,000
Only then I'll certify you

769
00:43:34,292 --> 00:43:37,167
Back to my hometown
That's an easy task

770
00:43:38,417 --> 00:43:40,583
I know what a big time fraud you are

771
00:43:41,042 --> 00:43:44,458
You will take a selfie with your family
and post it in Facebook daily

772
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,125
I will see it and 'like' it

773
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:48,083
Only after that I'll sign your forms

774
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:52,000
Fine, I'll do what you want

775
00:43:52,042 --> 00:43:54,708
But instead of only you liking it
ask your sister to do so too

776
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,917
Only then we can all be
one happy family!

777
00:43:57,208 --> 00:43:58,583
Aiyo!

778
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:02,167
Kathir, I am the psychologist here, right?

779
00:44:02,583 --> 00:44:05,708
Only I can find out
when someone lies

780
00:44:05,792 --> 00:44:08,833
So...I don't even have an older sister

781
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:11,208
Saroja Devi doesn't exist?

782
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:14,583
I have even tattooed
her name on my chest!

783
00:44:14,667 --> 00:44:15,958
I don't see it

784
00:44:16,292 --> 00:44:18,500
It merges with my complexion!

785
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:22,292
Fine, you cooked up an 'akka'
Don't you have a younger sister?

786
00:44:22,333 --> 00:44:24,125
Not just a sister

787
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:27,167
I don't have a family of my own

788
00:44:27,792 --> 00:44:31,333
Only those who don't have a family
know the value of kinship

789
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:34,583
You claim you have no family
out of sheer bottled up anger

790
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:38,458
What will you do if they
suddenly leave you?

791
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:41,375
If you don't appreciate them
when they are part of your life...

792
00:44:41,417 --> 00:44:44,708
...there's no use missing them
when they are no longer with you

793
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,750
'Go to your hometown now'

794
00:45:03,417 --> 00:45:05,167
Stop it
What's all this?

795
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:07,833
They are the elders of this village

796
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:10,583
When they heard you are
an army officer, they wanted to-

797
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:13,083
Will you start singing
as soon as I say 'army'?

798
00:45:13,167 --> 00:45:14,250
Keep quiet

799
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:16,167
How are you, son?
I am doing good

800
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:17,417
Ask...ask

801
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:19,542
- Ask him
- What do I ask?

802
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:20,875
Wait, he'll take it out

803
00:45:20,917 --> 00:45:21,958
What?

804
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
They said you'll bring
army 'fuel' along with you

805
00:45:28,042 --> 00:45:30,458
- They wanted to taste it
- Yes, my dear boy

806
00:45:30,542 --> 00:45:32,333
They are the respected elders of this village

807
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:33,792
They are old hands

808
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:36,042
He is 73
He is 72

809
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:37,333
They are all 70+

810
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:39,250
- Must be a large bottle
- Be quiet

811
00:45:39,417 --> 00:45:40,833
'Be patient'

812
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:45,375
Rangasamy, he is enlisted
in the army but even now...

813
00:45:45,417 --> 00:45:47,958
...he's pressing a ball like a kid

814
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,375
It is his...er-

815
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:52,000
- Go...go home
- Liquor?

816
00:45:52,042 --> 00:45:53,333
He'll slap you

817
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:54,458
Holding a flag to boot

818
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,250
You call yourself
a respectable man!

819
00:45:56,292 --> 00:45:57,292
Fat hopes!

820
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,458
Come here

821
00:45:59,708 --> 00:46:01,583
I told them you won't bring liquor

822
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:02,667
No need

823
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:04,417
- Come this side
- Where?

824
00:46:04,458 --> 00:46:06,792
I told them-
What?

825
00:46:07,417 --> 00:46:08,708
Smile

826
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:11,167
Look here and smile

827
00:46:16,917 --> 00:46:19,708
With a heavy heart I was forced
to take your mother's sacred chain

828
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:22,125
I didn't have the heart
to sell it, nor retain it

829
00:46:22,167 --> 00:46:24,042
So I melted the gold
and made it into a chain

830
00:46:24,083 --> 00:46:26,208
- I can give you Rs 30,000
- Thank you

831
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:31,542
"Like a child bowled over
gazing at the 1st raindrop ever"

832
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:34,000
"In wide-eyed wonder"

833
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:37,667
"I fell into her world of splendor"

834
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:42,000
"In my life till now I was oblivious
I missed those moments precious"

835
00:46:42,042 --> 00:46:44,583
"I bloomed when she reformed my ways"

836
00:46:44,667 --> 00:46:47,583
"New senses fell in place"

837
00:46:48,417 --> 00:46:53,583
"I walked past a flower pot daily
Discarded as junk justly"

838
00:46:53,667 --> 00:46:58,750
"But this pot cast aside however
nurtured a bud to bloom into a flower"

839
00:46:58,792 --> 00:47:02,083
"Bewitching eyes cast a spell
in my mind and heart as well"

840
00:47:02,167 --> 00:47:04,625
"Feet waiting to walk beside me proudly"

841
00:47:04,667 --> 00:47:09,000
"Hands patting my shoulder fondly"

842
00:47:09,042 --> 00:47:14,167
"With mini-moments many
a new meaning she gave me"

843
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:19,208
"A future ever so rosy
assured me, this lassie"

844
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:24,542
"From a mere shadow
she chiselled a statue"

845
00:47:24,583 --> 00:47:29,833
"She endorsed my tears of joy as true"

846
00:48:00,792 --> 00:48:03,667
"Why am I alive?
I was so indecisive"

847
00:48:03,708 --> 00:48:08,708
"Not taking time to analyze
I ran away from my own life"

848
00:48:08,792 --> 00:48:11,208
"Why did you plan
to make me a new man?"

849
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:14,167
"My repressed rage
Scars in storage"

850
00:48:14,167 --> 00:48:18,417
"She flung into the middle of nowhere
She healed my heart with love and care"

851
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:22,250
"She dusted the cobwebs away
Made me a humane being today"

852
00:48:22,292 --> 00:48:27,417
"An eternal wave of bliss
in a niche of my life she is"

853
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:32,458
"In a wind that blows night and day
her love is a 'live' relay"

854
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:37,833
"With mini-moments many
a new meaning she gave me"

855
00:48:37,875 --> 00:48:42,500
"This lovely lassie of mine
blessed me with a life sublime"

856
00:48:42,875 --> 00:48:48,125
"From a mere shadow
she chiselled a statue"

857
00:48:48,167 --> 00:48:53,083
"She affirmed my tears of joy as true"

858
00:48:53,458 --> 00:48:56,125
"A brook singing so spontaneously"

859
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:58,667
"Bees buzzing in a meadow simultaneously"

860
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:03,833
"The playful sun spreads its rays to reflect
on the moon in the sky like a basket"

861
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:08,500
"My mind in a delightful daze
watches nature's grandeur and grace"

862
00:49:08,917 --> 00:49:14,167
"It soaks up every pleasure
to cherish life as a treasure"

863
00:49:14,292 --> 00:49:18,333
"Like a child bowled over
gazing at the 1st raindrop ever"

864
00:49:18,375 --> 00:49:20,750
"In dewy-eyed wonder"

865
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:24,833
"I fell into her world of splendor"

866
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:28,625
"In my life till now I was oblivious
I missed those moments rapturous"

867
00:49:28,667 --> 00:49:31,167
"When she reformed me
I blossomed gradually"

868
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:34,667
"I revelled in new senses repeatedly"

869
00:49:35,917 --> 00:49:37,542
"This is the military liquor you wanted"

870
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:39,417
Only army personnel
will have access to it

871
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:41,292
I am also from the army
But I never got this

872
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:42,500
Were you also in the army?

873
00:49:42,542 --> 00:49:43,792
'Oviya's army'!

874
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:48,500
Shut up
Let me pour

875
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:50,292
Oviya army

876
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:51,458
Why not?

877
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,917
Drink to your heart's content
I am very happy today

878
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:57,958
Preserve this state of bliss
till you get married

879
00:49:58,042 --> 00:50:02,167
She changed my life in 30 days
with a ball worth just Rs 30

880
00:50:02,292 --> 00:50:04,792
She said, 'Your problem
is only in your vision'

881
00:50:04,833 --> 00:50:06,250
Did she say so?

882
00:50:06,375 --> 00:50:08,292
Short sight
or long sight?

883
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:10,083
Glasses can give you 20/20 vision

884
00:50:10,125 --> 00:50:14,167
'Good or bad is how
you perceive life', she said

885
00:50:14,542 --> 00:50:16,917
Even if I am a tough nut to crack...

886
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:19,042
...she showed me
the kind spirit hidden inside

887
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:21,167
Even we are full of spirit within!

888
00:50:21,208 --> 00:50:22,833
But anyway-

889
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,708
Yov! How come all of you
are buzzed with just 1 round?

890
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:30,667
[unintelligible rambling]

891
00:50:40,167 --> 00:50:42,250
Drink this tender coconut water, sir

892
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:45,167
Where am I?

893
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,708
This grove belongs to me, sir

894
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:51,167
You were fully sloshed
lying flat on the riverside

895
00:50:51,167 --> 00:50:52,750
I brought you here

896
00:50:54,333 --> 00:50:55,792
Where are the others?

897
00:50:55,833 --> 00:50:57,333
They left long ago, sir

898
00:50:59,625 --> 00:51:01,708
I have met you earlier, sir

899
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:05,125
Aren't you Selvi's elder brother?

900
00:51:06,042 --> 00:51:07,042
Yes

901
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:09,417
Selvi and I have been
dating for 5 years-

902
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,875
We want to get married, sir

903
00:51:10,917 --> 00:51:13,000
Your father also knows
He spoke to my parents

904
00:51:13,042 --> 00:51:15,000
I don't know what transpired

905
00:51:15,417 --> 00:51:18,458
After that, Selvi is just not
the same girl I fell in love with

906
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,708
She says we aren't compatible, sir

907
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:24,542
Even during her college days
I was scared in case people spotted us

908
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:25,833
But she was so brave

909
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:28,625
'We are anyway getting married
Who can stop us?' she used to say

910
00:51:28,667 --> 00:51:31,542
If we don't get married
whether I feel sad or regret it

911
00:51:31,583 --> 00:51:33,208
...I know Selvi will be shattered

912
00:51:33,292 --> 00:51:34,875
I didn't know how to deal with this

913
00:51:34,917 --> 00:51:36,917
That's why I thought
I should talk to you

914
00:51:36,958 --> 00:51:38,917
Help me out
Please, sir

915
00:51:40,542 --> 00:51:42,792
- What is your name?
- Kesavan, sir

916
00:51:44,708 --> 00:51:47,292
Selvi, I just met Kesavan

917
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:49,458
Heard you've been going steady for 5 years

918
00:51:49,708 --> 00:51:50,958
There's some kind of hassle

919
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,583
Why didn't you tell me about him?

920
00:51:54,917 --> 00:51:57,542
Hey! I'm talking to you

921
00:51:57,583 --> 00:51:59,042
Why should I tell you?

922
00:51:59,125 --> 00:52:00,292
I'm your elder brother

923
00:52:00,333 --> 00:52:02,125
Anna?
For whom?

924
00:52:02,375 --> 00:52:05,875
Just because you stay here now and eat
what I cook, will you become my brother?

925
00:52:05,917 --> 00:52:07,500
What do you know about me?

926
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:09,500
Do you even know
what I have studied?

927
00:52:09,542 --> 00:52:12,875
My likes and dislikes
Do you know anything?

928
00:52:12,917 --> 00:52:15,208
'You left us when I was 12'

929
00:52:15,417 --> 00:52:18,333
Have you called me and
talked to me at least 1 day?

930
00:52:18,458 --> 00:52:21,000
Do you know what
a motherless girl goes through?

931
00:52:21,042 --> 00:52:23,458
Your father and sister-
Why shouldn't I tell him?

932
00:52:23,583 --> 00:52:26,083
You won't tell him anything
Neither will you let me speak

933
00:52:26,125 --> 00:52:27,375
You may be scared of your son

934
00:52:27,417 --> 00:52:29,375
There isn't any need
for me to be scared of him

935
00:52:29,417 --> 00:52:31,833
He thinks we ruined his life

936
00:52:31,875 --> 00:52:33,542
With the money
you send every month...

937
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:35,458
...you think we are
living in a palace?

938
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:37,375
You're so self centered

939
00:52:37,417 --> 00:52:40,792
Selvi, don't mess up your life
because you're mad at me

940
00:52:41,583 --> 00:52:42,708
What is the problem?

941
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:45,500
Kesavan's mother is the trouble maker

942
00:52:45,542 --> 00:52:47,750
She called me over to their house

943
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:50,208
Spacious bungalow
Affluent family

944
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:53,917
1st she said she wouldn't
consent to this alliance

945
00:52:53,958 --> 00:52:58,250
I somehow convinced her
by pleading and persuading

946
00:52:58,333 --> 00:53:02,750
She wanted us to give a dowry
of 40 sovereigns of gold

947
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:05,250
I said we cannot afford to do so

948
00:53:05,667 --> 00:53:09,167
'Then why does your daughter
aspire to marry my son?'

949
00:53:10,042 --> 00:53:12,000
It was a slap on my face

950
00:53:13,583 --> 00:53:16,208
'I can't perform your wedding'

951
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:18,667
I told her to go ahead and elope

952
00:53:19,125 --> 00:53:20,375
But she isn't willing

953
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,208
Only the parents are materialistic

954
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:23,583
Kesavan is strong, right?

955
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:25,000
Then why hesitate?

956
00:53:25,417 --> 00:53:27,000
If I wanted to marry Kesavan...

957
00:53:27,042 --> 00:53:29,250
...I would have eloped
just like he asked me to

958
00:53:29,292 --> 00:53:31,083
I want to live together as a family

959
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:32,208
Without a mother

960
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,000
And as good as
not having a brother

961
00:53:34,042 --> 00:53:37,333
All these years, my life has been
appa and me within 4 walls

962
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:40,167
I never had a family
in my childhood

963
00:53:40,208 --> 00:53:43,375
When I walk into a home as bride
I definitely want a family to belong to

964
00:53:50,042 --> 00:53:53,333
You say Kesavan is a good chap
You also claim she really loves him

965
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:56,542
If we can't fulfil
this wish of hers...

966
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:58,000
...of what use are we?

967
00:53:58,042 --> 00:54:00,208
She is playful enough
to want the impossibl-

968
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:03,833
She is talking sense,
having thought about this deeply

969
00:54:03,875 --> 00:54:05,875
You are Selvi's appa
I am her anna

970
00:54:05,917 --> 00:54:08,750
But she says she has no family
and she's saying this to our face

971
00:54:08,792 --> 00:54:10,875
You haven't been
a good father to me

972
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,042
Neither have I been
a model son to you

973
00:54:15,875 --> 00:54:19,083
But I could have been
the perfect brother to Selvi, right?

974
00:54:19,958 --> 00:54:21,000
Alright

975
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:23,583
How much will you need
for her wedding?

976
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:27,375
Going by their demands
around 1 million

977
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:29,542
10 lakhs, huh?

978
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,958
How much will we get
if we sell mother's lands?

979
00:54:33,125 --> 00:54:34,500
0.4 million

980
00:54:36,708 --> 00:54:39,500
Okay, you make arrangements
to sell her land immediately

981
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:41,125
I'll take care of the rest

982
00:54:41,167 --> 00:54:43,250
You don't like borrowing money

983
00:54:43,292 --> 00:54:45,542
I don't but if I can't
do this even now...

984
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:47,792
...there's no meaning
to the life I'm leading

985
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:51,000
What matters to me now
is Selvi's happiness

986
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:54,583
Her brother will make this happen
come hell or high water

987
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:56,500
Tell her this right away

988
00:54:57,042 --> 00:54:58,542
Our guardian deity Nellai Appar-

989
00:54:58,583 --> 00:55:00,667
Don't stand here
Go and tell her

990
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:08,792
These files contain complaints against you

991
00:55:08,833 --> 00:55:14,708
Meet all your senior officers personally
and ask them to withdraw their complaints

992
00:55:14,792 --> 00:55:16,458
Then I'll look into
processing your loan

993
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:21,417
These officers are in various states
Meghalaya, Telangana, Kerala

994
00:55:21,458 --> 00:55:25,167
It will take 2-3 years to get
all of them to sign a withdrawal form

995
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,417
Sir, please, I need
this loan urgently

996
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:31,167
Army rules can't be bent
for your urgency or convenience

997
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:33,750
Apply for a loan
in a civilian bank

998
00:55:39,583 --> 00:55:42,333
You've already entered
Then why ask me for permission?

999
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:47,375
Where is the paper, pen?
My signature?

1000
00:55:47,458 --> 00:55:48,875
Patience...patience

1001
00:55:52,375 --> 00:55:53,583
Not bad, Kathir

1002
00:55:53,708 --> 00:55:55,417
I see a lot of changes in you

1003
00:55:57,667 --> 00:55:59,667
- You think so?
- Then what?

1004
00:55:59,958 --> 00:56:02,708
Like 'Pasamalar' aren't you here to
mobilize funds for the wedding?

1005
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:06,250
I'm facing a dead end
wondering how to get a loan

1006
00:56:06,292 --> 00:56:07,458
You'll find a way

1007
00:56:09,042 --> 00:56:11,500
So all the formalities are done

1008
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:14,417
You won't come to
see me hereafter, right?

1009
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:16,042
How can you say this?

1010
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:18,125
I'm applying for a loan only now

1011
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:20,500
I don't know how many banks
I may be forced to visit

1012
00:56:20,542 --> 00:56:23,500
I don't know how many managers
I will end up bashing!

1013
00:56:23,542 --> 00:56:25,917
If I spend 3 months
convincing 1 manager...

1014
00:56:26,042 --> 00:56:28,583
I'm in your custody
for a whole year!

1015
00:56:28,667 --> 00:56:31,958
If that happens, then it means
my training all along is a total waste

1016
00:56:32,292 --> 00:56:33,292
See you

1017
00:56:38,833 --> 00:56:42,333
I've been wanting to ask you this

1018
00:56:42,458 --> 00:56:44,875
I can't even stand this place for a day

1019
00:56:44,917 --> 00:56:46,875
How do you put up
with so many cases...

1020
00:56:46,917 --> 00:56:48,875
...and work without losing your temper?

1021
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:53,375
What?

1022
00:56:53,958 --> 00:56:55,542
Shall I let you in
on my secret?

1023
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:59,042
Those who bug you
and annoy you...

1024
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:00,583
...treat them like a kid

1025
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:02,333
You won't get angry

1026
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:04,167
You'll only be amused

1027
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:17,417
0.6 million

1028
00:57:18,375 --> 00:57:22,208
I'll process your loan
But I need some security, sir

1029
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,833
Those enlisted in the army are
the security guards to our nation

1030
00:57:24,875 --> 00:57:26,917
Is it fair to ask him for security?

1031
00:57:26,958 --> 00:57:29,167
You are right
I don't deny it

1032
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:31,333
Suppose I sanction your loan...

1033
00:57:31,375 --> 00:57:35,958
...tomorrow you go to fight
in our border and die in a bomb attack

1034
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,500
Whom will I go and claim the money?

1035
00:57:37,542 --> 00:57:38,792
I don't understand this

1036
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:40,500
Army officers don't have a passport

1037
00:57:40,542 --> 00:57:42,250
Neither do they have
proper ration cards

1038
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,458
If we come to you for help
you'll deny us a loan

1039
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,875
Then whom do we turn to, sir?

1040
00:57:45,917 --> 00:57:48,083
I am prepared to
sanction the loan for you

1041
00:57:48,167 --> 00:57:50,083
Give me a collateral
and I will oblige for sure

1042
00:57:50,125 --> 00:57:52,250
Why are we still here?
Elimination scowl-face!

1043
00:57:52,292 --> 00:57:53,542
Get lost, you warped wimp!

1044
00:57:53,583 --> 00:57:56,083
You will 'like' the photo
of a dead army officer in Facebook

1045
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:57,833
But you hate to give a helping hand

1046
00:57:57,875 --> 00:57:59,417
All you want is security, right?

1047
00:57:59,458 --> 00:58:01,500
4 security guards are outside
I'll send them in

1048
00:58:01,542 --> 00:58:03,583
Fit to sit in a petrol bunk
Not in this bank!

1049
00:58:04,333 --> 00:58:07,125
How can he deny a loan
to an army officer?

1050
00:58:07,208 --> 00:58:08,458
This isn't surprising

1051
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:11,875
Call your father, seeing the pathetic
look on his face, we'll get our loan

1052
00:58:11,917 --> 00:58:14,542
He has borrowed left, right and center
No one will respect him

1053
00:58:14,583 --> 00:58:17,292
Just listen to me
We don't have any proof

1054
00:58:17,333 --> 00:58:19,542
Rental agreement of my house
is in your father's name

1055
00:58:19,583 --> 00:58:21,042
Call him, we'll use that document

1056
00:58:21,083 --> 00:58:23,792
- Does this seem feasible to you?
- It is do-able, trust me

1057
00:58:26,125 --> 00:58:27,667
Hello, Rangu uncle

1058
00:58:27,708 --> 00:58:30,167
Look at your father's attire

1059
00:58:30,167 --> 00:58:32,417
Like Gurumurthy
in 'Sindhu Bairavi'

1060
00:58:32,458 --> 00:58:33,833
Mridangam expert

1061
00:58:33,875 --> 00:58:36,417
'Didn't I tell you?
Where is the mridangam?'

1062
00:58:36,667 --> 00:58:37,958
Ditto, that role

1063
00:58:38,292 --> 00:58:41,167
How come the bag is empty?
Did someone flick my 'item'?

1064
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:42,667
You think I'm a knucklehead!

1065
00:58:42,708 --> 00:58:44,708
You just now 'praised'
your father sky high!

1066
00:58:44,792 --> 00:58:46,542
He has an empty bag
to take all the cash

1067
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:47,583
Crackpot!

1068
00:58:47,667 --> 00:58:50,042
How are you?
How is my dress?

1069
00:58:50,083 --> 00:58:51,667
I managed to borrow some money

1070
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:55,042
I dyed my hair and got myself
some decent clothes to wear

1071
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:58,542
With a lot of fanfare,
high and mighty attitude

1072
00:58:58,583 --> 00:59:01,167
Oozing with charm and style
I met the groom's family

1073
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:02,292
They were zapped

1074
00:59:02,333 --> 00:59:06,083
I said, 'Why 1 million?
My son will fling 2 million in your face'

1075
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:07,667
They were speechless

1076
00:59:07,708 --> 00:59:10,167
Like you said
I sold your mother's land

1077
00:59:10,208 --> 00:59:12,917
I've deposited 0.4 million in
my account, this is the passbook

1078
00:59:12,958 --> 00:59:14,250
You said you'll give 0.6 million

1079
00:59:14,292 --> 00:59:16,375
If you give me that cash,
we can deposit that too

1080
00:59:16,417 --> 00:59:19,000
- We must deposit you in the sea
- Where is the money?

1081
00:59:19,042 --> 00:59:21,208
We have to scramble it
somehow only now

1082
00:59:24,167 --> 00:59:26,083
- Take off your coolers
- Fine

1083
00:59:28,208 --> 00:59:29,208
Age?

1084
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:34,250
He applied for the loan, right?
What is your age?

1085
00:59:34,292 --> 00:59:36,708
- 40...!
- You don't look 40

1086
00:59:36,792 --> 00:59:38,292
This dye is from California

1087
00:59:38,333 --> 00:59:40,708
Will you believe me if I say
I am 60 years old?

1088
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:44,583
Give me the file

1089
00:59:46,292 --> 00:59:49,500
Gold loan has so many benefits

1090
00:59:49,542 --> 00:59:50,833
Sir, avail a car loan

1091
00:59:50,875 --> 00:59:52,792
Get yourself a fridge,
TV, washing machine

1092
00:59:52,833 --> 00:59:54,917
Is he a banker or
owner of Vasanth & Co?

1093
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,875
We are applying
for a personal loan

1094
00:59:58,583 --> 01:00:05,292
According to our bank policy
can't sanction to those who are 50+

1095
01:00:05,333 --> 01:00:07,167
So even you aren't eligible, huh?

1096
01:00:07,167 --> 01:00:10,292
Can't you guess he'll help himself?
He's into adolescence only now

1097
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:13,542
How much is your pension?

1098
01:00:13,583 --> 01:00:15,708
Too much tension
at home with this

1099
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:18,375
We don't sanction loans to farmers

1100
01:00:18,417 --> 01:00:20,792
You treat farmers
with scant respect

1101
01:00:20,875 --> 01:00:22,000
You got it wrong

1102
01:00:22,042 --> 01:00:23,167
This is a private bank

1103
01:00:23,208 --> 01:00:24,958
Why don't you try in a Govt bank?

1104
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
I am sure you'll get

1105
01:00:26,042 --> 01:00:27,542
Can I have your phone number?

1106
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:31,708
Only private banks
can sanction this loan

1107
01:00:31,792 --> 01:00:33,333
Try in a Govt bank

1108
01:00:33,417 --> 01:00:35,875
There isn't a single transaction
in your bank statement

1109
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,292
[overlapping voices]

1110
01:00:42,167 --> 01:00:43,833
'No proper documents at all'

1111
01:00:43,917 --> 01:00:46,292
'What audacity, you want
to apply for a loan?'

1112
01:00:47,542 --> 01:00:48,542
Not only here

1113
01:00:48,583 --> 01:00:50,833
You'll never avail a loan
anywhere else either

1114
01:00:51,542 --> 01:00:56,375
[from 'Boss Engira Baskaran']

1115
01:00:56,417 --> 01:00:57,542
Give me a cigarette

1116
01:00:57,583 --> 01:00:59,667
What a lot of fuss for a loan-

1117
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:01,667
Okay, I'll go and wait-

1118
01:01:06,417 --> 01:01:08,333
No one is willing to sanction a loan

1119
01:01:08,875 --> 01:01:11,000
You wanted to go to the bar

1120
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,167
- You go
- Take care of your father

1121
01:01:13,167 --> 01:01:14,375
Don't leave him behind

1122
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,667
See you

1123
01:01:28,333 --> 01:01:30,000
Sir, you want a loan, huh?

1124
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:32,667
- Yes
- How much?

1125
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:35,750
- 0.6 million
- 6 lakhs, huh?

1126
01:01:36,042 --> 01:01:37,042
Home or vehicle?

1127
01:01:37,083 --> 01:01:38,583
Personal loan

1128
01:01:38,667 --> 01:01:41,583
Sir, who will sanction
a personal loan for 0.6 million?

1129
01:01:41,667 --> 01:01:43,375
You have no idea
of the present situation

1130
01:01:43,417 --> 01:01:44,708
Why rub salt on to the wound?

1131
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:47,417
- Attend to your work
- This is my work, sir

1132
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:49,333
I'll arrange it for you

1133
01:01:49,458 --> 01:01:51,292
We don't want to
go to a financier

1134
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:54,042
I'll get your loan sanctioned
in this very same bank

1135
01:01:54,917 --> 01:01:56,208
- How?
- Come along

1136
01:01:57,958 --> 01:02:00,042
'Sir, who gives personal loans these days?'

1137
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:03,125
'Personal loan is based on trust
between the lender and the borrower'

1138
01:02:03,167 --> 01:02:06,042
'Nowadays no one is
prepared to trust anyone'

1139
01:02:06,167 --> 01:02:08,708
Sir, if you own a car
you can avail a loan

1140
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:10,125
Or if you own a house

1141
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:11,708
Air conditioner, fridge, television

1142
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:14,542
You can get a loan to buy all this crap
But not for human beings!

1143
01:02:14,583 --> 01:02:16,833
Money is lent only to those who have money

1144
01:02:19,333 --> 01:02:22,000
Tell the bank manager
you own a Xerox shop in Ambattur

1145
01:02:22,042 --> 01:02:24,417
You want to convert it
into a browsing center

1146
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:26,833
And you plan to buy
40 to 50 computers

1147
01:02:26,875 --> 01:02:28,750
Ask for 0.6 million
as a business loan

1148
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:30,125
You can tick your wish list!

1149
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:31,792
We don't own any shop in Ambattur

1150
01:02:31,833 --> 01:02:33,583
Of course, you don't

1151
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:36,167
I know that and so do you
But is the bank officer aware?

1152
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:37,875
All he needs is only a document

1153
01:02:37,917 --> 01:02:39,583
Who ordered coffee?

1154
01:02:39,625 --> 01:02:40,833
Get 2 'samosas' for sir

1155
01:02:40,875 --> 01:02:42,542
- The other cup?
- Here

1156
01:02:42,583 --> 01:02:44,125
I will organize the paperwork

1157
01:02:44,167 --> 01:02:46,083
He will immediately
want to see the site

1158
01:02:46,125 --> 01:02:48,542
We will fix a shopkeeper
in Ambattur

1159
01:02:48,583 --> 01:02:51,833
If they inspect the shop and sign
the documents, your loan will be sanctioned

1160
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:55,042
After that you can relax at home
and pay your monthly interest

1161
01:02:55,083 --> 01:02:56,542
He will take it happily!

1162
01:02:58,417 --> 01:03:01,000
Somehow this doesn't feel right, sir

1163
01:03:02,042 --> 01:03:04,333
Are you hesitating to lie?

1164
01:03:04,667 --> 01:03:06,292
You were very honest now

1165
01:03:06,333 --> 01:03:07,667
Who gave you any loan?

1166
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:11,792
Sir, from getting married,
finding a job...

1167
01:03:11,833 --> 01:03:13,958
...to admitting your child in a school

1168
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,125
Everything is a lie or build up

1169
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:18,333
Look at your father
He is getting older by the day

1170
01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:20,500
You'll drag him into how many more banks?

1171
01:03:20,542 --> 01:03:22,042
- Think it over
- No, sir

1172
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:23,792
- I don't think this is right
- Wait

1173
01:03:23,875 --> 01:03:25,458
Ka...Kathir

1174
01:03:26,958 --> 01:03:28,083
1 minute

1175
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:29,750
Come here

1176
01:03:30,292 --> 01:03:31,333
What is it, pa?

1177
01:03:31,417 --> 01:03:33,417
Why are you refusing his offer?

1178
01:03:33,458 --> 01:03:35,125
He is asking us to cheat

1179
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,792
If you runaway
then you are cheating

1180
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:39,083
We are repaying the loan with interest

1181
01:03:39,125 --> 01:03:40,625
Somehow I am not comfortable, pa

1182
01:03:40,667 --> 01:03:43,042
It is said, 'You can lie
a 1000 times to conduct a wedding'

1183
01:03:43,083 --> 01:03:44,500
Can't you lie just once?

1184
01:03:44,542 --> 01:03:46,542
For how many more years
will you keep lying?

1185
01:03:46,583 --> 01:03:49,750
We walked up and down so many banks
but it was all a dead end

1186
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:52,750
He is showing us a way
We should conduct Selvi's wedding

1187
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:54,417
That's your mother's wish too

1188
01:03:54,458 --> 01:03:58,750
So if you can somehow
avail this loan-

1189
01:03:58,792 --> 01:04:00,750
Don't think too much, come in

1190
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:02,333
Come

1191
01:04:04,167 --> 01:04:05,250
Sit down

1192
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:07,458
What, sir?

1193
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:08,792
Okay, we will proceed

1194
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,292
- In whose name?
- My father

1195
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:13,458
Rangasamy

1196
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:19,167
We need 3 passport size photos
taken in 2014, 2012 and 2010

1197
01:04:19,292 --> 01:04:22,792
I will arrange all the documents
I guarantee, loan will be sanctioned 101%

1198
01:04:24,667 --> 01:04:25,917
Don't thank me

1199
01:04:26,167 --> 01:04:27,375
10%

1200
01:04:27,542 --> 01:04:29,125
- What?
- Then what?

1201
01:04:29,167 --> 01:04:31,750
The input is mine
I'm getting you 0.6 million

1202
01:04:31,792 --> 01:04:33,625
All I'm asking is 10%
Only Rs 60,000

1203
01:04:33,667 --> 01:04:35,125
- Think it over
- Now, huh?

1204
01:04:35,167 --> 01:04:36,333
I don't want it now

1205
01:04:36,375 --> 01:04:39,583
In your bank account
after 0.6 million is deposited

1206
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:42,167
...give me a check for Rs 60,000
That is enough

1207
01:04:43,708 --> 01:04:44,708
Okay, sir

1208
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:47,125
But you shouldn't let me down
in the last minute, sir

1209
01:04:47,167 --> 01:04:49,583
- We would never dream of that
- Okay

1210
01:04:51,167 --> 01:04:53,917
'Thank heavens!
Finally the loan is sanctioned'

1211
01:04:53,958 --> 01:04:56,917
Hold this, let me know
when the bank sends you a message

1212
01:04:56,958 --> 01:04:58,667
- Happy?
- Top of the world, you bet

1213
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:01,042
- 'Give me your ID card'
- Loan was sanctioned in a jiffy

1214
01:05:01,083 --> 01:05:03,250
Welcome, sir
Is everything finalized?

1215
01:05:03,375 --> 01:05:06,042
- Everything has been approved
- How can I go wrong?

1216
01:05:06,083 --> 01:05:08,583
What did I tell you?
I don't need your thanks

1217
01:05:08,917 --> 01:05:11,000
Give me 10%
That's all I ask

1218
01:05:11,042 --> 01:05:12,542
Do you want it in cash?

1219
01:05:12,583 --> 01:05:13,875
I prefer a check

1220
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:17,000
Hari Krishnan

1221
01:05:17,083 --> 01:05:20,417
- You have a heart of gold
- Your happiness is as good as mine

1222
01:05:21,875 --> 01:05:23,958
- Here you go
- Thank you

1223
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,458
'He has pocketed it!'

1224
01:05:25,708 --> 01:05:27,750
Keep it in this
Shall we take leave?

1225
01:05:30,667 --> 01:05:32,292
Uncle, take a good look

1226
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:34,042
This is an ATM

1227
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:36,375
'It has so many buttons
all over the screen'

1228
01:05:36,417 --> 01:05:39,333
There is only 1 difference between
an ATM and a voting machine

1229
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:42,333
In an ATM if you press the button
you can take your money

1230
01:05:42,708 --> 01:05:44,667
- In a voting machine?
- 1st you take the money

1231
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:46,750
- Then press the button
- Experience talks, eh?

1232
01:05:46,792 --> 01:05:48,458
'I'm a veteran voter!'

1233
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,125
Hey! Dragged it in
Now it's gone!

1234
01:05:50,167 --> 01:05:52,042
Wait, don't be in a hurry, Mr Rash!

1235
01:05:52,958 --> 01:05:55,000
- You've got a number now
- What number?

1236
01:05:55,042 --> 01:05:56,417
4648

1237
01:05:56,458 --> 01:05:58,167
Don't share this # with anyone

1238
01:05:58,208 --> 01:06:00,208
You got it?
Press 4648

1239
01:06:00,417 --> 01:06:01,417
4 sixes?

1240
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:02,625
6 once

1241
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:04,458
6 twice

1242
01:06:04,583 --> 01:06:05,667
Third-

1243
01:06:05,708 --> 01:06:08,125
Thekkady, Munnar, Ooty
You'll be left with zero

1244
01:06:08,167 --> 01:06:10,417
- What did I do?
- Cancel it

1245
01:06:10,958 --> 01:06:13,083
Just press 4648

1246
01:06:13,125 --> 01:06:14,625
- Is it 4648?
- Yes

1247
01:06:14,667 --> 01:06:17,500
You should say it precise like this
instead of confusing me

1248
01:06:17,542 --> 01:06:18,625
4

1249
01:06:18,667 --> 01:06:20,958
6-4-8

1250
01:06:21,042 --> 01:06:23,042
- Press okay
- Green button?

1251
01:06:23,958 --> 01:06:26,750
- Look at your name there
- Yes, Rangasamy

1252
01:06:26,792 --> 01:06:28,708
Now how much
money do you need?

1253
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:30,625
- 25,000
- Look at the screen

1254
01:06:30,667 --> 01:06:33,042
'2 then 5'

1255
01:06:33,083 --> 01:06:34,417
'And 000'

1256
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:36,333
Can you hear the cash being counted?

1257
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:37,833
Is there a man sitting inside?

1258
01:06:39,417 --> 01:06:40,625
Take your cash

1259
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:42,708
Yaaay! I got my money

1260
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:45,000
If you keep clapping, it will go in
What will you do?

1261
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:46,167
Will it go in?

1262
01:06:46,833 --> 01:06:47,833
I got my money

1263
01:06:47,875 --> 01:06:48,875
Wait

1264
01:06:49,792 --> 01:06:51,833
Who on earth is calling me
so late at night?

1265
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:53,917
It's a message
Read it out to me

1266
01:06:53,958 --> 01:06:57,042
The amount you withdrew
will be notified in your mobile

1267
01:06:57,083 --> 01:06:58,583
- Immediately?
- Yes

1268
01:06:58,625 --> 01:07:00,750
I'm zapped!
What speed, eh?

1269
01:07:01,958 --> 01:07:05,167
The local caterers are not our cup of tea

1270
01:07:05,208 --> 01:07:07,000
Our cooks back home
count every penny

1271
01:07:07,042 --> 01:07:09,292
If we pay them Rs 5000
as a token advance...

1272
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:11,792
...the wedding feast will be
the talk of the town, okay?

1273
01:07:11,833 --> 01:07:12,875
Fine, uncle

1274
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:15,042
- Appa
- Yes, dear?

1275
01:07:15,083 --> 01:07:17,167
Go to the ATM
and withdraw Rs 5,000

1276
01:07:17,292 --> 01:07:19,000
- To pay an advance
- Alright

1277
01:07:19,083 --> 01:07:21,333
Do you want me to come along
or will you manage?

1278
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:23,750
Do you want to tag along
and note my pin #?

1279
01:07:23,792 --> 01:07:26,667
You told me clearly
I shouldn't reveal that # to anyone

1280
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:28,750
4648, I won't
breathe a word to anyone

1281
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:30,250
Your father is beyond redemption!

1282
01:07:30,292 --> 01:07:32,667
After wearing your glasses
don't fall into some ditch

1283
01:07:33,625 --> 01:07:36,458
'Even at this age
he's so agile and alert!'

1284
01:07:43,042 --> 01:07:44,667
- Tell me
- Where are you?

1285
01:07:44,708 --> 01:07:46,958
- Haven't you left as yet?
- My father is leaving today

1286
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,875
I am leaving day after tomorrow

1287
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:51,167
Shouldn't I attend the wedding?

1288
01:07:51,208 --> 01:07:53,167
You don't have to attend the wedding

1289
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:55,750
- It's enough if you attend the reception
- Why?

1290
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:59,000
- You are so attractive
- 'Hooked her hook, line and sinker!'

1291
01:07:59,042 --> 01:08:01,000
'My family will fall flat for you'

1292
01:08:01,042 --> 01:08:04,667
They will say I'm next in queue
to tie the sacred thread

1293
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:07,292
My family, kith and kin, friends
will force you to marry me

1294
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:08,750
Why put you through all tha-

1295
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:11,708
The guests will be more keen on
where lunch is being served

1296
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:13,750
'As if finding a bride
for you is their agenda'

1297
01:08:13,792 --> 01:08:17,167
If they were so good hearted
shouldn't they have got me married?

1298
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:19,083
How long will I be the one to cook?

1299
01:08:19,125 --> 01:08:20,167
Who is that?

1300
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:21,667
'How long will I be single?'

1301
01:08:22,833 --> 01:08:25,417
I have to see my next patient
I'll call you later

1302
01:08:25,458 --> 01:08:27,917
He has such huge feet
imagine his shoe size!

1303
01:08:27,958 --> 01:08:31,083
I just wondered about
your shoe size

1304
01:08:31,167 --> 01:08:32,958
'I am smarter than you
So you're jealous!'

1305
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:38,083
"Gold earring belonging to my mother
Flicked away by my father"

1306
01:08:38,125 --> 01:08:41,125

In 1 gulp guzzled by my mother"

[popular Malayalam folk song]

1308
01:08:44,458 --> 01:08:46,000
Uncle, yuck!

1309
01:08:46,042 --> 01:08:47,250
What are you upto?

1310
01:08:47,292 --> 01:08:50,167
I am empowering my body
to do 'something'!

1311
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:52,250
My father seems to be missing for ages

1312
01:08:52,292 --> 01:08:54,250
Isn't he back from the ATM?

1313
01:08:54,292 --> 01:08:56,292
I volunteered to accompany him
Did he agree?

1314
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:59,583
He would have fallen into a ditch
and the cleaners would have dumped him

1315
01:08:59,667 --> 01:09:02,417
- Get into your pants
- I'll follow you in a jiffy

1317
01:09:05,542 --> 01:09:07,292
He has left his mobile here

1318
01:09:13,625 --> 01:09:16,583
- Why did you leave your phone behind?
- Wait, I'm coming

1319
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,000
Did you withdraw the cash?

1320
01:09:19,042 --> 01:09:20,833
- No
- Why?

1321
01:09:20,875 --> 01:09:23,042
This card is spoilt
Something wrong with it

1322
01:09:23,417 --> 01:09:24,833
- Spoilt?
- Yes

1323
01:09:24,917 --> 01:09:26,667
Is this a banana to get spoiled?

1324
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,292
You wouldn't have inserted it properly

1325
01:09:28,333 --> 01:09:30,375
I did it just the way
he taught me

1326
01:09:32,458 --> 01:09:34,750
- Cash didn't pop out
- I am sure it will

1327
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:37,083
'I did the same thing before'

1328
01:09:37,167 --> 01:09:39,458
- What should you do next?
- Press the PIN #

1329
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:40,792

- It's me

1333
01:09:46,708 --> 01:09:48,917
- What should you do next?
- Amount

1334
01:09:48,958 --> 01:09:50,125
- How much?

1335

This is what I got
when I came earlier

1338
01:10:03,625 --> 01:10:05,500
Give me your card

4648

1340
01:10:22,042 --> 01:10:24,625
I got only this receipt
and my card popped out

1341
01:10:24,667 --> 01:10:26,750
'Something is wrong with the card'

1342
01:10:26,792 --> 01:10:28,583
'We should change the card'

01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,292
'Something wrong with it'

1344
01:10:33,083 --> 01:10:34,625
We should get the money

1345
01:10:34,708 --> 01:10:36,708
- Let's go to the bank
- Alright

1346
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:38,083
Useless machine!

1347
01:10:38,375 --> 01:10:40,792
Check it tonight
It will be activated by then

1348
01:10:43,125 --> 01:10:45,667
- Sir, tell me
- He is my father

1349
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:48,417
1 million is missing from his account

1350
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,375
What are you saying?

1351
01:10:50,458 --> 01:10:52,458
- Is the money missing?
- Missing, huh?

1352
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:57,083
Did someone rob it from you
after you withdrew?

1353
01:10:57,125 --> 01:10:59,583
No, sir, it is missing
directly from his account

1354
01:11:00,167 --> 01:11:02,292
How is that possible, sir?

1355
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:05,792
- Tell me your account #
- 8747298472

1356
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:09,250
Please wait, let me
check your statement

1357
01:11:26,417 --> 01:11:28,000
You have spent it

1358
01:11:28,042 --> 01:11:29,625
Check your transactions

1359
01:11:39,917 --> 01:11:42,125
None of these transactions
were made by us

1360
01:11:42,167 --> 01:11:44,250
Money has been withdrawn
from your account, sir

1361
01:11:44,292 --> 01:11:45,708
Only you have access to it

1362
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:47,333
No, sir, I am very sure

1363
01:11:47,458 --> 01:11:49,917
So many transactions
I am completely stumped

1364
01:11:49,958 --> 01:11:51,917
All of them are online transactions

1365
01:11:51,958 --> 01:11:53,250
Who else could have done this?

1366
01:11:53,292 --> 01:11:56,750
I swear my father has no clue
about online transactions or the internet

1367
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:59,125
Did you give your user ID
and password to anyone?

1368
01:11:59,167 --> 01:12:00,875
I don't know all that, sir

1369
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:03,417
4648, I know only this #

1370
01:12:03,458 --> 01:12:04,750
That's all he knows, sir

1371
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:06,708
Everything here works
on double door system

1372
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:09,750
No one other than you
can operate your account

1373
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:13,125
I swear, we have nothing to do
with all these withdrawals, sir

1374
01:12:13,958 --> 01:12:15,458
Follow my suggestion

1375
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:18,583
File a complaint in the police station
Get me a copy of the report

1376
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:20,750
We will help you
to the best of our ability

1377
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:28,083
We never withdrew any amount

1378
01:12:28,458 --> 01:12:31,000
He says it isn't in my account
How unjust is this!

1379
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:34,667
Even the shop is missing

1380
01:12:34,708 --> 01:12:36,083
What is happening?

1381
01:12:38,167 --> 01:12:40,625
What happened to the shop over there?

1382
01:12:40,667 --> 01:12:43,542
'It was open for a whole month
For the past 2 days it's missing'

1383
01:12:43,583 --> 01:12:46,292
That man in there asked us
to complain to the police

1384
01:12:46,333 --> 01:12:48,167
Appa, keep quiet

1385
01:12:48,292 --> 01:12:50,583
You catch 29C bus and
go home, I'll deal with this

1386
01:12:50,625 --> 01:12:51,833
I'll also come-

1387
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:00,875
Kathir, tell me

1388
01:13:00,917 --> 01:13:03,375
- I need a small favor
- What is the matter?

1389
01:13:03,417 --> 01:13:04,917
Someone has withdrawn my money

1390
01:13:04,958 --> 01:13:05,917
Whaaat?

1391
01:13:05,958 --> 01:13:07,167
Your money is missing

1392
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:11,625
Will you give me the details
of this account number?

1393
01:13:11,667 --> 01:13:12,958
Tell me, I'll note it down

1394
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,250
Tell me the account #

1395
01:13:20,167 --> 01:13:22,250
Kathir, the account is in Brazil

1396
01:13:22,292 --> 01:13:23,750
- Brazil?
- Yes

1397
01:13:23,792 --> 01:13:25,500
In the name of a computer dealer

1398
01:13:25,542 --> 01:13:27,958
Okay, give me the contact details
of that company

1399
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
- Wait, I'll text you now
- Make it fast

1400
01:13:33,792 --> 01:13:38,167
'Welcome to Brazil Computer service'

1401
01:13:39,125 --> 01:13:41,792
What do you mean?
Money is gone?

1402
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:44,625
'For customer service press # 01'

1403
01:13:44,667 --> 01:13:46,167
This is a Brazil account, Major

1404
01:13:46,458 --> 01:13:47,750
It is not our jurisdiction

1405
01:13:47,792 --> 01:13:51,083
'For troubleshooting problems press 02'

1406
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:55,167
No use taking this matter
to the police, Major

1407
01:13:55,208 --> 01:13:58,125
'To talk to our Customer care
executive, press # 03'

1408
01:13:58,167 --> 01:14:01,125
Kathir, the assistant commissioner
is my best friend's father

1409
01:14:01,167 --> 01:14:03,125
If we meet him
we can solve this

1410
01:14:12,125 --> 01:14:16,458
You claim to have availed a loan to open
a browsing centre and to purchase computers

1411
01:14:16,542 --> 01:14:17,958
- Am I right?
- Yes, sir

1412
01:14:18,167 --> 01:14:19,667
'What about this statement?'

1413
01:14:19,708 --> 01:14:22,000
It confirms the purchase of the computers

1414
01:14:22,042 --> 01:14:25,583
Sir, according to this statement
all the accounts are in Brazil

1415
01:14:25,625 --> 01:14:28,333
You can hear a strange language
on the other end when we call

1416
01:14:28,375 --> 01:14:30,708
I had no one to turn to
That's why I came here

1417
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:31,750
Okay

1418
01:14:31,792 --> 01:14:35,917
Ordering the computers and
the missing money is an account in Brazil

1419
01:14:36,292 --> 01:14:39,917
What is the delivery address
you had filled in the form?

1420
01:14:39,958 --> 01:14:41,375
Ambattur, sir

1421
01:14:41,792 --> 01:14:45,250
Do you really own
the shop in Ambattur?

1422
01:14:48,125 --> 01:14:49,208
No, sir

1423
01:14:49,292 --> 01:14:52,000
Then in this case
you are the 1st fraud

1424
01:14:53,375 --> 01:14:55,417
You have forged Govt documents

1425
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:57,333
Which means you have cheated the Govt

1426
01:14:57,375 --> 01:14:59,333
You have conned a private bank

1427
01:14:59,792 --> 01:15:02,167
You have come to register
a false complaint now

1428
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:04,917
All these 4 cases
can put you behind bars

1429
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:06,458
Imprisonment for 18 months

1430
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:07,583
Is it okay?

1431
01:15:08,083 --> 01:15:09,125
Then what, dear?

1432
01:15:09,167 --> 01:15:12,917
If a random stranger promises a loan
will you give all your details?

1433
01:15:12,958 --> 01:15:14,125
He tricked you

1434
01:15:14,167 --> 01:15:17,958
I am talking to you just because
you came along with her

1435
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,917
If you had come when I was on duty...

1436
01:15:19,958 --> 01:15:22,792
I would have bashed you up
and put you behind bars

1437
01:15:22,833 --> 01:15:24,583
I face 1000s of cases like this daily

1438
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:25,958
They are ordinary people

1439
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,125
You are an army officer
Are you brainless?

1440
01:15:28,667 --> 01:15:29,750
Listen, dear

1441
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:31,375
Nothing can be done officially

1442
01:15:31,417 --> 01:15:33,167
If you want you can try unofficially

1443
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:35,042
Leave now

1444
01:15:44,125 --> 01:15:47,792
Pay your monthly interest without fail

1445
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:50,458
'If you don't, the bank officer
will be at your doorstep'

1446
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:54,583
'If he finds out you don't own the shop
you'll be behind bars, beware!'

1447
01:15:57,500 --> 01:16:00,333
We can't perform Selvi's wedding
in our present situation

1448
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:02,750
We can't even complain to the police

1449
01:16:02,792 --> 01:16:04,625
I don't know what to do

1450
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:06,375
Can we get back the money?

1451
01:16:07,167 --> 01:16:09,333
We have already printed the invitations

1452
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:14,458
Somehow I feel I made a mistake, uncle

1453
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:17,250
Kathir, don't get worked up

1454
01:16:17,292 --> 01:16:19,875
At this point only if you are clear
you can think straight

1455
01:16:19,917 --> 01:16:22,125
'We will find the money
Don't get perturbed'

1456
01:16:22,167 --> 01:16:23,333
Son

1457
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:27,000
Why don't we borrow 1 million
from some other bank?

1458
01:16:32,958 --> 01:16:34,417
Why just 1 million?

1459
01:16:34,458 --> 01:16:35,958
3 million?

1460
01:16:36,417 --> 01:16:38,417
We can even borrow 5 million

1461
01:16:38,458 --> 01:16:42,917
You don't have an iota of disgrace,
dismay, shame, sensitivity or even dignity

1462
01:16:42,958 --> 01:16:46,125
You don't even have any intention
of returning the loan

1463
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,667
But I want to return that money

1464
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:52,417
You are ready to ask anyone shamelessly

1465
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:55,833
By borrowing from anyone and everyone
like this, you ruined my life

1466
01:16:57,917 --> 01:16:59,042
You will happily borrow

1467
01:16:59,083 --> 01:17:01,542
When the creditor turns up
you'll go in and hide

1468
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:03,708
Otherwise you'll bow your head in shame

1469
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:05,583
I told you right then

1470
01:17:05,667 --> 01:17:07,750
Let us not get into this mess

1471
01:17:08,458 --> 01:17:09,750
All because of you

1472
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:13,458
I've been pushed into a corner to
borrow by forging a document

1473
01:17:14,042 --> 01:17:16,458
That police officer branded me a fraud

1474
01:17:16,667 --> 01:17:18,542
I have suffered a lot
because of you

1475
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:19,792
But today...

1476
01:17:21,042 --> 01:17:22,417
I was humiliated

1477
01:17:23,708 --> 01:17:26,750
Finally you have made me
bow my head also in shame like you

1478
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:27,958
Don't, Kathir

1479
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,542
You borrowed nonstop
and killed my mother

1480
01:17:31,333 --> 01:17:32,750
Now you are killing me

1481
01:17:34,167 --> 01:17:35,708
Next you will kill my sister too

1482
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:36,792
Don't say this-

1483
01:17:36,833 --> 01:17:39,042
But you be happy
borrowing all the time

1484
01:17:39,208 --> 01:17:40,833
Clear out!

1485
01:17:43,042 --> 01:17:44,125
Appa

1486
01:17:45,917 --> 01:17:48,000
I am scared I'll bash you up

1487
01:17:48,083 --> 01:17:49,208
Kathir!

1488
01:17:49,458 --> 01:17:50,500
Go away, pa

1489
01:17:52,917 --> 01:17:54,167
GET LOST!

1490
01:18:02,833 --> 01:18:05,458
That 0.6 million is through
fraudulent means, I agree

1491
01:18:06,542 --> 01:18:10,542
But the balance 0.4 million is money saved
by my mother treading the sewing machine

1492
01:18:10,958 --> 01:18:12,375
I need that money back

1493
01:18:13,083 --> 01:18:14,250
I will not let that go

1494
01:18:15,417 --> 01:18:16,667
Kathir

1495
01:18:20,458 --> 01:18:23,250
'Loan agent Hari you mentioned
Number isn't registered in his name'

1496
01:18:23,292 --> 01:18:25,500
'It's in the company's name
Closed User Group'

1497
01:18:25,542 --> 01:18:27,292
'Which company?'

1498
01:18:27,333 --> 01:18:29,208
'It's an Import & Export company'

1499
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:30,750
'In Vadapalani'

1500
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:36,208
Is there any company here
called Offshore International?

1501
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,833
Not that I've heard of

1502
01:18:38,083 --> 01:18:40,125
For the past 5 years I am working here

1503
01:18:40,167 --> 01:18:42,500
'There is no such company here'

1504
01:18:45,583 --> 01:18:48,542
Albert, there isn't any company
by that name here

1505
01:18:48,583 --> 01:18:50,000
You mentioned a CUG #

1506
01:18:50,042 --> 01:18:51,875
Check if any other #
is active in that group

1507
01:18:51,917 --> 01:18:53,333
1 minute
Let me check

1508
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,792
23 numbers are registered

1509
01:18:57,875 --> 01:18:59,750
'Hey! 1 number is active'

1510
01:19:00,208 --> 01:19:01,708
- Is it so?
- 'Yes'

1511
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,458
Can you tell me the area?

1512
01:19:27,833 --> 01:19:30,125
'Don't thank me, sir
I charge 10%'

1513
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:32,958
'0.8 million is the loan
You must pay me 80,000'

1514
01:19:33,125 --> 01:19:35,083
'No cash, only check
I'm very particular'

1515
01:19:35,125 --> 01:19:39,750
We need 3 passport size photos
taken in 2010, 2011 and 2012

1516
01:19:39,792 --> 01:19:43,375
I will arrange all the documents
You don't have to worry, see you

1517
01:20:47,958 --> 01:20:49,167
Don't hit me, sir

1518
01:20:49,208 --> 01:20:50,792
Where is my money?
Tell me

1519
01:20:50,833 --> 01:20:54,125
See this baby's face
She is my daughter

1520
01:20:54,167 --> 01:20:55,458
I have a child, sir

1521
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,833
I know very well
you tricked me

1522
01:20:57,875 --> 01:20:59,125
You had better blurt it out

1523
01:20:59,167 --> 01:21:00,167
TELL ME

1524
01:21:00,208 --> 01:21:01,542
I'll confess, sir

1525
01:21:02,333 --> 01:21:04,250
I hope you won't go to the police

1526
01:21:07,167 --> 01:21:08,375
Answer that call

1527
01:21:08,667 --> 01:21:09,750
Pick it up

1528
01:21:13,583 --> 01:21:14,750
Talk

1529
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:21,333
Sir, the call is for you

1530
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:29,250
'Did your anna talk to you?'

1531
01:21:29,292 --> 01:21:30,375
'He did'

1532
01:21:30,417 --> 01:21:33,250
'He has arranged all the cash
for our wedding it seems'

1533
01:21:33,292 --> 01:21:35,292
'You made me wait for so long'

1534
01:21:35,667 --> 01:21:37,375
'Wait until our wedding night!'

1535
01:21:38,708 --> 01:21:39,917
'What will you do?'

1536
01:21:42,667 --> 01:21:44,417
'As if you don't know'

1537
01:21:47,542 --> 01:21:49,250
Forgive these 2 youngsters

1538
01:21:49,292 --> 01:21:51,542
'They had no clue
someone was listening in'

1539
01:21:51,875 --> 01:21:53,000
Not wrong

1540
01:21:53,333 --> 01:21:56,208
'What they spoke was not wrong
Nor what I listened'

1541
01:21:56,458 --> 01:21:58,417
But you are standing over there

1542
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:00,125
'Only that is wrong'

1543
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:03,792
Take your hand off!

1544
01:22:09,833 --> 01:22:11,000
If you take 1 step forward

1545
01:22:11,042 --> 01:22:13,333
...your sister's conversation will go viral

1546
01:22:14,042 --> 01:22:15,833
If you take another step forward...

1547
01:22:15,875 --> 01:22:18,083
'...I'll post that link
on her Facebook wall'

1548
01:22:18,917 --> 01:22:21,667
Did you think you can catch me
using him as your bait?

1549
01:22:22,167 --> 01:22:23,250
'According to me'

1550
01:22:23,292 --> 01:22:25,542
...you are after all just a number

1551
01:22:25,875 --> 01:22:28,750
'No problem as long as
you remain a number'

1552
01:23:22,458 --> 01:23:24,583
[phone ringing]

1553
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:33,000
- 'Kathir?'
- Tell me, uncle

1554
01:23:33,083 --> 01:23:35,125
- 'You got back home?'
- Where are you?

1555
01:23:35,167 --> 01:23:36,875
'I am still at the bar'

1556
01:23:37,333 --> 01:23:40,417
'Kathir, why were you so rude
to your father yesterday?'

1557
01:23:40,625 --> 01:23:42,458
'We are all the family he has'

1558
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:45,042
'Poor man! He was devastated'

1559
01:23:56,417 --> 01:23:57,500
Father

1560
01:23:58,083 --> 01:23:59,250
Let's eat, pa

1561
01:24:02,083 --> 01:24:03,125
Appa

1562
01:24:03,208 --> 01:24:04,583
Come, let's eat

1563
01:24:08,917 --> 01:24:10,542
Why are you crying now?

1564
01:24:11,292 --> 01:24:12,708
I lost my temper yesterday

1565
01:24:12,792 --> 01:24:14,625
Will you hold that against me?

1566
01:24:15,167 --> 01:24:16,500
I am upset with you, pa

1567
01:24:16,625 --> 01:24:19,042
I don't hate you
My anger will dissipate

1568
01:24:19,333 --> 01:24:20,542
After all it's only money

1569
01:24:20,833 --> 01:24:22,042
Let it go

1570
01:24:23,125 --> 01:24:25,625
But I can't bear to see you like this

1571
01:24:29,333 --> 01:24:30,667
Please forgive me

1572
01:24:30,708 --> 01:24:32,250
Why should you apologize?

1573
01:24:32,292 --> 01:24:33,417
Come, let's eat

1574
01:24:34,167 --> 01:24:35,333
Why, pa?

1575
01:24:37,667 --> 01:24:38,958
Poison-

1576
01:24:39,792 --> 01:24:40,792
What...?

1577
01:24:42,625 --> 01:24:44,542
I consumed poison, son

1578
01:24:44,583 --> 01:24:47,542
- What are you saying, pa?
- On an impulse

1579
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:50,625
You are bleeding, pa

1580
01:25:07,042 --> 01:25:08,250
Appa

1581
01:25:09,792 --> 01:25:11,042
My dear son

1582
01:25:11,125 --> 01:25:12,667
Are you out of your mind?

1583
01:25:12,708 --> 01:25:15,875
Will you be rash and impulsive
in your decisions all the time?

1584
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:19,833
You usually ask me this

1585
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:25,417
'Don't you feel dismayed,
disgraced or dishonored?'

1586
01:25:26,583 --> 01:25:28,500
I have no such feelings

1587
01:25:29,417 --> 01:25:31,542
Your mother was unwell

1588
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:34,708
The doctor said she would die within a year

1589
01:25:35,375 --> 01:25:37,625
You and your sister were very young then

1590
01:25:38,042 --> 01:25:42,333
How could I tell you
your mother will pass away in a year?

1591
01:25:43,333 --> 01:25:47,125
I borrowed money from
every Tom, Dick and Harry possible

1592
01:25:47,167 --> 01:25:48,417
I knew

1593
01:25:49,333 --> 01:25:51,625
...I couldn't repay those loans

1594
01:25:52,125 --> 01:25:55,208
Your mother, who was told
she'll be alive for only 1 year

1595
01:25:56,333 --> 01:25:57,792
...3 years

1596
01:25:58,708 --> 01:26:00,833
I extended her life
for your sake

1597
01:26:03,875 --> 01:26:06,708
That was the only reason
I borrowed money from everyone

1598
01:26:09,708 --> 01:26:11,167
Let me tell you this now

1599
01:26:11,292 --> 01:26:13,542
For the sake of
both my children's happiness...

1600
01:26:13,583 --> 01:26:16,125
...I'm prepared to fall
at anyone's feet and plead

1601
01:26:16,208 --> 01:26:18,250
'I will borrow any amount of money'

1602
01:26:18,667 --> 01:26:20,125
You be brave

1603
01:26:20,167 --> 01:26:21,458
I'm there for you

1604
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:23,917
We shall conduct the wedding
in great pomp and styl-

1605
01:26:23,958 --> 01:26:25,958
'Sir, you shouldn't strain yourself'

1606
01:26:26,042 --> 01:26:27,417
'Take rest'

1607
01:26:28,208 --> 01:26:29,667
I was talking to my son-

1608
01:26:29,708 --> 01:26:32,625
'Let the patient rest for a while
Please wait outside, sir'

1609
01:26:38,125 --> 01:26:40,208
'Relax, Selvi
Your father is fine'

1610
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:42,667
'He wasn't feeling too good
So we admitted him here'

1611
01:26:46,542 --> 01:26:48,333
Anna, how is appa?

1612
01:26:49,208 --> 01:26:50,208
Much better

1613
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:51,250
Can I see him?

1614
01:26:51,958 --> 01:26:53,000
He's sleeping

1615
01:26:57,208 --> 01:26:59,458
He will be discharged tomorrow morning

1616
01:27:00,875 --> 01:27:04,125
We haven't divulged the fact
he consumed poison to Selvi

1617
01:27:04,708 --> 01:27:05,875
You don't tell either

1618
01:27:05,917 --> 01:27:07,708
'Forgive these 2 youngsters'

1619
01:27:07,792 --> 01:27:09,958
'They had no clue
someone was listening in'

1620
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,292
1 minute

1621
01:27:12,417 --> 01:27:14,375
Selvi, give me your phone

1622
01:27:15,083 --> 01:27:16,542
I'll call you later

1623
01:27:24,375 --> 01:27:27,042
Major, this phone was
switched off 10 minutes ago

1624
01:27:27,083 --> 01:27:28,542
But the battery is still hot

1625
01:27:28,667 --> 01:27:30,375
Some software is still running inside

1626
01:27:32,833 --> 01:27:35,417
Major, switch on your phone
and give it to me

1627
01:27:35,458 --> 01:27:36,958
Tell me your number

1628
01:27:40,708 --> 01:27:42,208
I'll disconnect your call now

1629
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:45,417
Just watch, only after 3 seconds
your call will disconnect here

1630
01:27:48,375 --> 01:27:50,083
'Your SIM is also hacked, Major'

1631
01:27:50,125 --> 01:27:52,875
Not only that, he can also listen
to all your normal phone calls

1632
01:27:52,958 --> 01:27:54,625
Can't you trace the hacker?

1633
01:27:54,667 --> 01:27:56,958
He's called a hacker
only because he can't be traced!

1634
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
All of us possess
smart phones today

1635
01:27:59,042 --> 01:28:01,083
When we install an app
not reading its contents...

1636
01:28:01,125 --> 01:28:02,792
...we allow access to many of our details

1637
01:28:02,833 --> 01:28:06,333
We don't 'allow' access to only this app
We permit hackers into our daily routine

1638
01:28:06,375 --> 01:28:08,833
Major, you would've received
an empty text message

1639
01:28:08,875 --> 01:28:10,542
'You may not even remember it'

1640
01:28:10,583 --> 01:28:13,708
But from the moment you opened
that message, all your information

1641
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:18,208
Someone has hacked everything

1642
01:28:18,917 --> 01:28:20,250
Is there no other option?

1643
01:28:20,292 --> 01:28:21,333
Only 1 solution

1644
01:28:21,417 --> 01:28:22,833
Don't use smart phones at all

1645
01:28:22,875 --> 01:28:24,500
He's tracking your GPS

1646
01:28:24,583 --> 01:28:27,708
'Use your father's basic mobile, Major
which has no app at all'

1647
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:30,667
'He won't be able to track
nor hack your information'

1648
01:28:31,708 --> 01:28:34,292
It's fine even if he hacked Selvi's phone

1649
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:37,333
But how did he find out
she is my sister?

1650
01:28:37,875 --> 01:28:39,417
I am totally in the dark

1651
01:28:39,667 --> 01:28:42,625
As if he traced it, you are
providing all the information

1652
01:28:42,667 --> 01:28:43,708
Me...?

1653
01:28:43,750 --> 01:28:46,167
Yes, you've been divulging
all the information about you

1654
01:28:46,208 --> 01:28:47,333
Look here

1655
01:28:47,375 --> 01:28:49,375
Last month alone you uploaded 30 photos

1656
01:28:51,042 --> 01:28:52,833
You keep uploading your personal life

1657
01:28:52,917 --> 01:28:54,167
Let me tell you

1658
01:28:54,208 --> 01:28:56,542
Last month a chap kidnapped
a boy from Kodambakkam

1659
01:28:56,583 --> 01:28:57,583
How did he do it?

1660
01:28:57,625 --> 01:28:59,542
When that kid yawns in the morning...

1661
01:28:59,583 --> 01:29:01,250
...his mother takes a selfie

1662
01:29:01,292 --> 01:29:03,125
'Then in the shower
or when he's crapping!'

1663
01:29:03,167 --> 01:29:05,458
'When dropping him in school
with the exact timing!'

1664
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:08,458
Buy an ice cream in the color
he prefers and take a selfie

1665
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:12,042
The kidnapper browsed through her profile
He knew 12 noon is ice cream time

1666
01:29:12,083 --> 01:29:14,917
He bought him an ice cream
in his favorite color, kidnapped the kid

1667
01:29:14,958 --> 01:29:17,500
'If we provide all the information 
and then complain about it!'

1668
01:29:17,542 --> 01:29:19,500
'These guys can never be caught'

1669
01:29:25,208 --> 01:29:27,750
Kathir, he wanted to meet you

1670
01:29:27,792 --> 01:29:29,542
- Here he is
- Sir, my name is Vasanth

1671
01:29:29,583 --> 01:29:33,625
A year ago I was in need of money
for my mother's heart transplantation

1672
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:35,625
We have no medical loan
in our country

1673
01:29:35,708 --> 01:29:38,875
Besides that if a person is 50+
insurance is a pipedream!

1674
01:29:38,958 --> 01:29:42,333
I had no other choice but to
fake my documents to avail a loan

1675
01:29:42,417 --> 01:29:44,208
But within a day of her admission...

1676
01:29:44,292 --> 01:29:46,167
...someone stole that entire amount

1677
01:29:46,208 --> 01:29:48,125
I'm not bothered about
the missing amount

1678
01:29:48,167 --> 01:29:49,958
But I wasn't able to save my mother!

1679
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,417
What can we do?

1680
01:29:51,458 --> 01:29:53,167
I went to her for counseling

1681
01:29:53,208 --> 01:29:55,333
She told me you're facing
the same problem too

1682
01:29:55,375 --> 01:29:58,542
Don't know how many more
innocent people will be conned

1683
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:03,417
Unable to pinpoint who was responsible
for his mother's death...

1684
01:30:03,458 --> 01:30:05,292
...he blamed himself for it

1685
01:30:05,417 --> 01:30:07,667
You aren't an ordinary person like him

1686
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:11,750
1st you thought only about yourself

1687
01:30:11,792 --> 01:30:13,875
Then you started to
bond with your family

1688
01:30:13,958 --> 01:30:15,458
When they had a problem...

1689
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:17,250
...you wanted to seek revenge

1690
01:30:17,292 --> 01:30:19,833
To take revenge, this is not just
your personal problem

1691
01:30:19,875 --> 01:30:21,417
This affects the general public

1692
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:22,833
Go after this fiend

1693
01:30:22,917 --> 01:30:24,000
Nab him

1694
01:30:24,375 --> 01:30:25,667
But not to take revenge

1695
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:27,583
For the sake of justice

1696
01:30:31,667 --> 01:30:34,458
'Sir, I got a mail claiming
I had won a gift of 0.5 million'

1697
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:36,958
'When I clicked on that link
some random chap called me'

1698
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,000
'He said my gift will be delivered
to my doorstep, all I had to do was...'

1699
01:30:40,083 --> 01:30:42,333
'...pay just Rs 50,000
for excise duty at the airport'

1700
01:30:42,375 --> 01:30:44,125
'I borrowed money
and paid it too'

1701
01:30:44,167 --> 01:30:47,792
'Only then I came to know
Custom office isn't in our airport!'

1702
01:30:47,875 --> 01:30:49,417
'I was duped big time, sir'

1703
01:30:49,417 --> 01:30:52,417
The postman will deliver
my monthly pension amount

1704
01:30:52,458 --> 01:30:55,417
A year ago because it's 'Digital age' now

1705
01:30:55,458 --> 01:30:58,792
I was asked to sign saying
my money will be directed to the bank

1706
01:30:58,833 --> 01:31:00,042
That is it, sir

1707
01:31:00,083 --> 01:31:03,083
When I went to the pension office,
they said they've sent it to the bank

1708
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:05,500
I went to the bank, they said
cash wasn't received at all

1709
01:31:05,542 --> 01:31:07,917
Sir, where does this cash vanish then?

1710
01:31:07,958 --> 01:31:09,667
For my son's education...

1711
01:31:09,708 --> 01:31:13,292
...like a sparrow, I had saved
0.2 million working day and night

1712
01:31:13,333 --> 01:31:16,083
After a few weeks I went to
the bank to withdraw money

1713
01:31:16,125 --> 01:31:20,458
I was told I had already withdrawn
my money using my card

1714
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:24,500
Only because it isn't safe to keep cash
at home, I deposited it in the bank

1715
01:31:27,333 --> 01:31:29,708
[overlap of anguished voices]

1716
01:31:32,708 --> 01:31:34,625
In all the ATM server machines...

1717
01:31:34,667 --> 01:31:35,917
...there is a switch

1718
01:31:35,958 --> 01:31:39,208
You would've gone to an ATM
and entered your pin, right?

1719
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:41,417
At that time, your banker...

1720
01:31:41,458 --> 01:31:44,250
...will open that switch
to check your details

1721
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:46,333
In that gap...

1722
01:31:46,583 --> 01:31:48,042
...these bloody thieves

1723
01:31:48,083 --> 01:31:50,708
...will steal lower denomination
cash like 1,2 and 5 rupees

1724
01:31:51,083 --> 01:31:54,125
We'll assume our bank is
charging that amount

1725
01:31:54,167 --> 01:31:55,917
We will curse our bank
and carry on

1726
01:31:55,958 --> 01:31:59,542
Earlier on only humans were cheated
in order to earn money the short cut way

1727
01:31:59,583 --> 01:32:03,208
But today their con game is targeted
at the computer trusted by humans

1728
01:32:03,250 --> 01:32:05,708
God knows which country
these villains are in!

1729
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:07,750
Go back to your job
Impossible to catch them

1730
01:32:07,833 --> 01:32:09,417
This doesn't seem right to me

1731
01:32:09,417 --> 01:32:12,000
Let's find some other option
to meet our need

1732
01:32:12,042 --> 01:32:15,083
Bro, I thought you would have
settled in Barcelona by now

1733
01:32:15,167 --> 01:32:17,667
- Instead you're with this bar chap
- Froggy back again!

1734
01:32:17,708 --> 01:32:19,000
I'm in a kind of mess

1735
01:32:19,042 --> 01:32:21,542
- What happened, bro?
- Money in my account is missing!

1736
01:32:21,583 --> 01:32:22,875
How much, brother?

1737
01:32:23,250 --> 01:32:24,500
1 million

1738
01:32:24,542 --> 01:32:25,917
10 lakhs?

1739
01:32:26,125 --> 01:32:27,667
Why did you tell him?
Let's go

1740
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:29,667
Brother, I've got an idea

1741
01:32:29,708 --> 01:32:30,875
Let's talk about it

1742
01:32:30,917 --> 01:32:32,250
Come, I'll tell you

1743
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:35,958
I'm an employee of this bank

1744
01:32:36,083 --> 01:32:37,458
We don't share it with everyone

1745
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:39,250
Only a preferred minority 
will be in the loop

1746
01:32:39,292 --> 01:32:42,042
Many customers have lost
30,000 or 40,000 in our bank

1747
01:32:42,083 --> 01:32:44,458
They will enquire in the bank
but it will be a dead end

1748
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:47,875
Salman comes from Ritchie street
to repair the computer systems in our bank

1749
01:32:47,917 --> 01:32:50,875
He will take a small commission
and redeem your balance amount

1750
01:32:50,917 --> 01:32:52,167
Don't tell him it's 1 million

1751
01:32:52,208 --> 01:32:53,375
'He may panic'

1752
01:32:53,417 --> 01:32:55,417
Tell him it's 50,000
and ask him to redeem it

1753
01:32:55,458 --> 01:32:57,625
'3rd shop as soon as
you enter Ritchie street'

1754
01:32:57,667 --> 01:32:59,917
'Salman System
Repair and Service'

1755
01:32:59,958 --> 01:33:01,750
'Refer my name to him, bro'

1756
01:33:04,417 --> 01:33:05,708
This is the shop

1757
01:33:07,083 --> 01:33:08,667
Who is Salman Khan here?

1758
01:33:08,708 --> 01:33:09,958
I am Salman

1759
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,042
Gnyanavel sent me

1760
01:33:11,083 --> 01:33:12,250
Money from my account-

1761
01:33:12,292 --> 01:33:14,292
Just a minute
Chotu, take care of the shop

1762
01:33:14,333 --> 01:33:15,333
'Yes, bhai'

1763
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:20,542
You barged into my shop
and broached this topic

1764
01:33:20,583 --> 01:33:22,000
Don't be so indiscreet

1765
01:33:22,042 --> 01:33:23,833
- What's the amount?
- 50,000

1766
01:33:23,875 --> 01:33:25,625
50,000?
It's a huge amount

1767
01:33:25,667 --> 01:33:28,375
If any of our boys had taken,
you'll get 35,000 back

1768
01:33:28,417 --> 01:33:29,417
What is this?

1769
01:33:29,458 --> 01:33:31,500
We'll get back only 35000
of our own money!

1770
01:33:31,542 --> 01:33:33,042
Who is denying that?

1771
01:33:33,083 --> 01:33:35,333
If you go to the court or cops
they will usurp all of it

1772
01:33:35,375 --> 01:33:36,875
Will you get your money back?

1773
01:33:38,917 --> 01:33:42,292
Take a left in that corner, you'll find
a shop 'Mithu Mobiles & Electronics'

1774
01:33:42,333 --> 01:33:44,292
One of my boys Robert will be there

1775
01:33:44,333 --> 01:33:45,625
I'll give you his #
Note it down

1776
01:33:45,667 --> 01:33:48,042
'Call him from outside his shop
He'll come out'

1777
01:33:48,375 --> 01:33:50,167
Hello...is that right?

1778
01:33:51,083 --> 01:33:52,083
Okay

1779
01:33:52,542 --> 01:33:55,125
Your father is being
discharged from the hospital

1780
01:33:55,167 --> 01:33:56,417
You leave
I'll handle this

1781
01:33:56,458 --> 01:33:58,000
- Take care then
- Okay

1782
01:34:00,125 --> 01:34:02,375
'Bro, display doesn't work
I bought it only a week ago'

1783
01:34:02,417 --> 01:34:03,625
'Fix it, bro
If I take it-'

1784
01:34:03,667 --> 01:34:05,250
Why are you nagging me?

1785
01:34:05,292 --> 01:34:08,042
'No warranty or guarantee
You'll go to the company, huh?'

1786
01:34:08,083 --> 01:34:09,625
My rate is fixed price

1787
01:34:10,917 --> 01:34:12,583
Bro, we've been like siblings

1788
01:34:12,625 --> 01:34:14,958
'You are so rude even to me
Please fix it for me'

1789
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,708
How many customers I've got you?
I bring my friends here

1790
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:19,042
Come back tomorrow

1791
01:34:19,083 --> 01:34:20,667
'- I'll try to fix it
 - Thanks, bro'

1792
01:34:31,958 --> 01:34:34,292
- Sir, Robert?
- Yes, I am Robert

1793
01:34:34,417 --> 01:34:36,292
Salman asked me to meet you

1794
01:34:36,333 --> 01:34:37,708
Salman-

1795
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,625
The shop inside that complex

1796
01:34:39,667 --> 01:34:42,417
He gave me your # and asked me
to share my account details

1797
01:34:42,417 --> 01:34:44,000
I called you just now

1798
01:34:44,042 --> 01:34:45,500
You disconnected my call

1799
01:34:45,542 --> 01:34:47,250
No, I didn't get any call

1800
01:34:47,292 --> 01:34:50,167
Sir, I called you just now
and you hung up on me

1801
01:34:50,208 --> 01:34:52,583
I've been here all along
but I didn't receive any calls

1802
01:34:52,625 --> 01:34:54,042
Sir, you heard him, right?

1803
01:34:54,083 --> 01:34:55,625
Simply hanging around
Clear out now

1804
01:34:55,667 --> 01:34:57,875
- Give me a Samsung charger
- Give it to him

1805
01:34:57,917 --> 01:34:59,875
I don't know whom you're referring

1806
01:34:59,917 --> 01:35:02,583
Bugging me in the morning
like you're Yama's client!

1807
01:35:02,625 --> 01:35:04,375
Jobless jerk!
Pestering me

1808
01:35:04,417 --> 01:35:06,208
- Who is that beanpole?
- No idea

1809
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:08,042
'He got the wrong shop I think'

1810
01:35:08,083 --> 01:35:09,833
'What was the model number?'

1811
01:35:09,875 --> 01:35:11,542
'Bro, I sent you a message'

1812
01:35:11,583 --> 01:35:13,625
'Hey, I didn't get any message today'

1813
01:35:17,417 --> 01:35:18,833
- You withdrew cash?
- Yes

1814
01:35:18,917 --> 01:35:21,083
'It will be notified in
your mobile at once'

1815
01:35:21,708 --> 01:35:23,667
'Sir, all of them are
online transactions'

1816
01:35:23,708 --> 01:35:25,583
'You would've got a message, sir'

1817
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:32,375
- Can you block sms on this phone?
- What...?

1818
01:35:32,417 --> 01:35:35,458
- Can you block sms on this phone?
- Can't be done, sir

1819
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:37,833
Can you block messages
from my bank on this phone?

1820
01:35:37,875 --> 01:35:39,708
- Bro, tea
- Sir, we don't do that here

1821
01:35:39,750 --> 01:35:41,875
- Sir, come to our shop
- Clear out now, sir

1822
01:35:41,958 --> 01:35:44,750
'Come to the tea shop
in the corner of this street, sir'

1823
01:35:44,833 --> 01:35:46,208
Bro, 1 ginger tea

1824
01:35:46,292 --> 01:35:47,292
Tell me, sir

1825
01:35:47,375 --> 01:35:49,417
Is it your # or
you wife's number?

1826
01:35:49,417 --> 01:35:51,792
- I don't get you
- Customers who come to us

1827
01:35:51,833 --> 01:35:53,708
...share a joint account with their wives

1828
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:56,458
They get caught by taking money
without their wife's knowledge

1829
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:58,875
- What about your case?
- It's my number

1830
01:35:59,250 --> 01:36:01,292
Are you okay spending
around 15000, sir?

1831
01:36:01,375 --> 01:36:02,458
15,000?

1832
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:04,458
Why get zapped
about just 15000?

1833
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:07,417
- No one will do this for less
- Can you do it for sure?

1834
01:36:07,417 --> 01:36:08,833
Child's play, sir

1835
01:36:08,875 --> 01:36:11,000
Give our bro a glass of tea
I'll be right back

1836
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:19,458
A chap wants messages from the bank
to be blocked, shall I bring him over?

1837
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:21,500
Not today, ask him
to come another day

1838
01:36:21,542 --> 01:36:23,292
He looks such a greenhorn

1839
01:36:23,375 --> 01:36:25,375
Roaming around with
15000 bucks in his pocket

1840
01:36:25,417 --> 01:36:26,500
I've asked him to wait

1841
01:36:26,542 --> 01:36:28,625
It's his own account
I did a thorough check

1842
01:36:28,667 --> 01:36:30,042
No problem at all

1843
01:36:30,292 --> 01:36:32,875
- Where have you made him wait?
- Near our shop

1844
01:36:38,833 --> 01:36:40,292
Why did you bring him here?

1845
01:36:40,333 --> 01:36:41,458
I just sent him away

1846
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:44,292
Haven't I told you not to bring
clients without checking, scumbag?

1847
01:36:44,333 --> 01:36:45,500
Why are you such a pain?

1848
01:36:45,542 --> 01:36:47,917
- Will you bring any random chap?
- Why, bro?

1849
01:36:50,375 --> 01:36:52,792
- Yes, sir?
- Is it possible to block sms?

1850
01:36:52,917 --> 01:36:54,667
All that isn't done here, sir

1851
01:36:55,042 --> 01:36:56,333
He told me you can

1852
01:36:56,375 --> 01:36:59,042
Sir, he's a tea vendor
How will he know about mobiles?

1853
01:36:59,083 --> 01:37:00,458
Hey, get going

1854
01:37:01,708 --> 01:37:03,083
Tell me

1855
01:37:03,417 --> 01:37:05,833
Is it possible to
eavesdrop on phone calls?

1856
01:37:12,667 --> 01:37:15,542
Sir, do you know what
you are asking and where?

1857
01:37:15,625 --> 01:37:17,167
We don't do that here

1858
01:37:17,208 --> 01:37:19,167
- You can't?
- I'm saying I can't

1859
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:20,458
Please leave, sir

1860
01:38:45,167 --> 01:38:47,292
There's a chap here
acting extra smart

1861
01:38:47,333 --> 01:38:50,333
Bring 5 of our boys
and come to our subway

1862
01:38:50,417 --> 01:38:51,917
Let's pound him to a pulp

1863
01:39:01,667 --> 01:39:04,042
I changed my mind
Bring 10 of our boys

1864
01:39:04,292 --> 01:39:06,458
We'll bruise him black and blue
Rip his mouth apart

1865
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:08,292
He's going overboard, I say

1866
01:39:13,458 --> 01:39:15,667
Gopal, you'll come for sure, right?

1867
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:17,292
'He's following me'

1868
01:39:17,375 --> 01:39:19,083
Bring 'Baldie' Sekar with you

1869
01:39:19,125 --> 01:39:20,875
We shouldn't spare him today

1870
01:39:20,917 --> 01:39:22,917
'Let us bury him alive in the subway'

1871
01:39:23,542 --> 01:39:25,750
Hey, don't you know
you can't come in this 1 way?

1872
01:39:25,792 --> 01:39:27,792
Go...go...keep going

1873
01:39:34,417 --> 01:39:35,958
Hey, Gopal...?

1874
01:39:38,583 --> 01:39:40,000
Where the hell were you?

1875
01:39:40,042 --> 01:39:41,792
Trusting you
I exaggerated your power

1876
01:39:41,833 --> 01:39:43,583
I told you I'll come
What's up with you?

1877
01:39:43,625 --> 01:39:46,750
Only 2 of you are here
Where are the rest?

1878
01:39:46,792 --> 01:39:48,417
Wait, man
They will join us

1879
01:39:48,417 --> 01:39:49,667
Where is he?

1880
01:40:23,875 --> 01:40:26,500
We were on our way
and you kept calling us!

1881
01:40:29,708 --> 01:40:32,667
Hey! You had your fill?
You thought I was fibbing?

1882
01:40:32,708 --> 01:40:35,417
15 of us, we can
close your chapter

1883
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,333
How strange, I say
He doesn't even flinch

1884
01:40:40,375 --> 01:40:42,375
If you keep talking,
how will he panic?

1885
01:40:42,417 --> 01:40:44,250
2 swift blows should do the tric-

1886
01:40:44,417 --> 01:40:45,958
'What is it, machi?'

1887
01:40:46,792 --> 01:40:49,417
'Hey, last warning for you'

1888
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:51,958
'This is Sekar in person
Scoot for your life'

1889
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,375
Thrash him

1890
01:43:06,333 --> 01:43:07,708
Where is my money?

1891
01:43:12,375 --> 01:43:14,042
Where is my money?

1892
01:43:14,417 --> 01:43:15,583
Answer me

1893
01:43:20,167 --> 01:43:22,792
- Where's my cash?
- Sir, I swear I don't know

1894
01:43:22,833 --> 01:43:24,042
Sir, believe me

1895
01:43:30,417 --> 01:43:32,458
Where's my money?
Tell me

1896
01:43:32,542 --> 01:43:34,250
Sir, I didn't take your money

1897
01:43:34,292 --> 01:43:35,875
I swear I don't know about it

1898
01:43:35,917 --> 01:43:38,458
Then why did you get scared
seeing my number?

1899
01:43:39,083 --> 01:43:41,167
- Tell me
- I'll tell you, sir

1900
01:43:42,167 --> 01:43:45,833
I was the one who blocked
all the messages you got from the bank

1901
01:43:46,875 --> 01:43:48,333
How did you block it?

1902
01:43:48,917 --> 01:43:51,500
Darknet was the app I used
for all the blocking

1903
01:43:52,875 --> 01:43:54,333
Darknet...?

1904
01:43:55,250 --> 01:43:57,208
- Means...?
- We can't use internet

1905
01:43:57,250 --> 01:43:59,542
...normally for illegal purposes

1906
01:43:59,583 --> 01:44:01,542
But we can do it
through Darknet

1907
01:44:01,625 --> 01:44:03,833
It has a browser called Tor

1908
01:44:03,958 --> 01:44:05,417
The onion ring!

1909
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:06,833
'Like an onion, sir'

1910
01:44:06,875 --> 01:44:08,875
'Keep peeling its layers
you'll find nothing'

1911
01:44:08,917 --> 01:44:11,250
'You can't trace it
how much ever you track'

1912
01:44:11,292 --> 01:44:15,375
Darknet is the hub
of all illegal activities

1913
01:44:15,417 --> 01:44:18,125
'Black market weapon
Child trafficking'

1914
01:44:18,167 --> 01:44:19,750
'Terrorism, drugs'

1915
01:44:19,833 --> 01:44:22,333
Even cinema piracy
This is its source

1916
01:44:26,875 --> 01:44:28,583
Who is the mastermind behind this?

1917
01:44:28,667 --> 01:44:30,208
I have no idea, sir

1918
01:44:30,250 --> 01:44:32,667
I'll get a phone #
from an user ID

1919
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,708
1st I'll hack that #, sir

1920
01:44:35,292 --> 01:44:37,375
I'll dig out all the information
from that phone

1921
01:44:37,417 --> 01:44:38,792
Your conversation

1922
01:44:38,833 --> 01:44:42,167
Your sms and OTP
I'll know everything

1923
01:44:42,333 --> 01:44:44,833
After that I'll receive a date, sir

1924
01:44:44,958 --> 01:44:49,458
On that date I'll block all messages
you receive from your bank

1925
01:44:50,375 --> 01:44:53,208
Only in that time frame
your amount will be withdrawn

1926
01:44:53,375 --> 01:44:55,083
Your phone calls

1927
01:44:55,667 --> 01:44:57,000
Videos you've saved

1928
01:44:57,417 --> 01:44:58,833
Personal photos

1929
01:44:58,875 --> 01:45:00,292
I'll submit everything

1930
01:45:00,333 --> 01:45:02,917
He'll pay me a hefty sum
for this task, sir

1931
01:45:03,083 --> 01:45:04,583
What is the user ID?

1932
01:45:08,458 --> 01:45:09,958
White Devil, sir

1933
01:45:15,375 --> 01:45:17,667
Darknet's kingpin ID

1934
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:21,458
I don't even know from
which country he operates

1935
01:45:26,458 --> 01:45:28,333
I haven't seen his face either

1936
01:45:34,542 --> 01:45:36,375
Not even heard his voice

1937
01:45:38,208 --> 01:45:40,292
We won't be able to reach him

1938
01:45:40,417 --> 01:45:42,333
He's the don of the digital world!

1939
01:45:47,625 --> 01:45:48,792
Fear

1940
01:45:50,708 --> 01:45:53,583
More than the food our parents
fed us when we were kids...

1941
01:45:53,667 --> 01:45:55,875
...the emotion spooned to us in excess

1942
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,083
Fear

1943
01:45:58,500 --> 01:46:01,417
Eat otherwise the 1 eyed Cyclops
or a monster will grab you

1944
01:46:01,417 --> 01:46:04,667
Their false information fixed
a state of panic in our brains

1945
01:46:04,708 --> 01:46:05,750
And we grew up

1946
01:46:09,542 --> 01:46:11,000
'In 1969...'

1947
01:46:11,208 --> 01:46:14,417
...more than the computer which NASA used
to send rockets to the moon

1948
01:46:14,417 --> 01:46:17,000
...today the smart phone in your hands

1949
01:46:17,375 --> 01:46:19,458
...is million times more powerful

1950
01:46:25,208 --> 01:46:26,917
The wars waged before this era...

1951
01:46:26,958 --> 01:46:28,250
...were weapon wars

1952
01:46:28,458 --> 01:46:30,000
After that was bio war

1953
01:46:30,208 --> 01:46:31,667
Now it is cyber war

1954
01:46:33,625 --> 01:46:35,625
For a person who knows
to use data properly

1955
01:46:35,667 --> 01:46:37,500
...it isn't mere information

1956
01:46:37,667 --> 01:46:38,958
It's a weapon!

1957
01:46:41,708 --> 01:46:43,250
If he decides...

1958
01:46:43,333 --> 01:46:46,792
...he can lower anyone's value

1959
01:46:55,333 --> 01:46:56,792
Anyone's value...

1960
01:46:58,125 --> 01:46:59,625
...can be raised sky high

1961
01:47:18,125 --> 01:47:20,167
'Hunt for food everyday in hunger'

1962
01:47:20,208 --> 01:47:23,125
'Hey! My loan got sanctioned
Will be deposited in my account tomorrow'

1963
01:47:23,167 --> 01:47:25,167
'Narrate tales of no relevance whatsoever'

1964
01:47:25,208 --> 01:47:27,958
'Encounter order has been filed
He'll die in another 2 days, bro'

1965
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,667
'Indulge in actions that make others wilt'

1966
01:47:30,708 --> 01:47:32,333
'I banged someone'

1967
01:47:32,375 --> 01:47:33,417
'He died on the spot'

1968
01:47:33,458 --> 01:47:36,583
'Succumb to vileness and finally
vanish without a trace eternally'

1969
01:47:36,625 --> 01:47:39,208
'How was the video
I sent you in WhatsApp?'

1970
01:47:39,250 --> 01:47:44,333
Tamil poet Bharati has advised us not to
emulate the lives of some peculiar people

1971
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:45,542
'That means...'

1972
01:47:45,625 --> 01:47:47,583
'...we must achieve something'

1973
01:47:54,417 --> 01:47:55,792
Long live India!

1974
01:48:03,417 --> 01:48:06,417
Hey! How do you know
my account details?

1975
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:08,250
Not only that, sir

1976
01:48:08,292 --> 01:48:09,833
Your off shore accounts

1977
01:48:10,042 --> 01:48:11,583
6 billion

1978
01:48:11,708 --> 01:48:14,667
Your account has been frozen
You can't bring the money into India

1979
01:48:14,708 --> 01:48:18,167
I'll bring the entire amount
without leaving a single paisa behind

1980
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:21,625
It isn't even our Govt

1981
01:48:21,667 --> 01:48:24,125
Do you know how many
international Govts are involved?

1982
01:48:27,625 --> 01:48:29,333
What are you expecting in return?

1983
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:37,625
I need all the satellite link codes
under your control

1984
01:48:40,167 --> 01:48:41,500
Why do you need that?

1985
01:48:41,750 --> 01:48:43,792
I am a man
with 1000 eyes!

1986
01:48:46,167 --> 01:48:49,417
Not a single data should exit
without my purview

1987
01:48:49,417 --> 01:48:50,750
Are you playing the fool?

1988
01:48:50,792 --> 01:48:52,833
Do you know how huge
a server farm you need?

1989
01:48:52,875 --> 01:48:55,083
I own a 2 acre server farm

1990
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:58,333
Without Govt knowledge?

1991
01:48:58,375 --> 01:49:00,375
Haven't you hoarded 6 billion
in the same way?

1992
01:49:00,417 --> 01:49:01,542
Likewise

1993
01:49:12,958 --> 01:49:15,167
'Sir, a loan for 10 million'

1994
01:49:15,792 --> 01:49:17,667
'Get it done somehow, sir'

1995
01:49:34,292 --> 01:49:35,625
'His name is Sivakumar'

1996
01:49:35,667 --> 01:49:37,042
He is their next victim

1997
01:49:37,083 --> 01:49:39,250
What are you waiting for?
Call and alert him

1998
01:49:39,292 --> 01:49:40,792
That isn't priority now

1999
01:49:40,917 --> 01:49:42,167
If we follow him...

2000
01:49:42,250 --> 01:49:44,625
...we can nab White Devil
who is behind this scam

2001
01:49:44,667 --> 01:49:46,042
How do we go about it?

2002
01:49:46,083 --> 01:49:48,500
Sivakumar has applied
for a loan of 10 million

2003
01:49:48,542 --> 01:49:50,333
'This is a huge amount'

2004
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:53,125
'So there's a likelihood of
White Devil getting his hands dirty'

2005
01:49:53,167 --> 01:49:56,167
We've traced Sivakumar's location
with this phone number

2006
01:49:56,250 --> 01:49:57,875
If my calculation is right...

2007
01:49:57,917 --> 01:50:00,583
'...Sivakumar's money will
go kaput in the next 2 days'

2008
01:50:00,833 --> 01:50:03,750
'He has to submit his document
and get it approved today'

2009
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:06,833
'If we follow him, we'll get
the link to White Devil'

2010
01:50:07,208 --> 01:50:08,750
R.Sivakumar

2011
01:50:08,833 --> 01:50:10,750
You can't run or hide

2012
01:50:12,250 --> 01:50:14,208
'Stop mimicking
We are following him, Major'

2013
01:50:14,250 --> 01:50:16,958
Ola cab

2014
01:50:37,792 --> 01:50:39,458
Can't you see the red light?

2015
01:50:39,542 --> 01:50:40,917
'Why do you keep honking?'

2016
01:50:40,958 --> 01:50:43,625
There isn't any cop here
Just move a little bit, I'll go

2017
01:50:43,667 --> 01:50:45,625
The CCTV is on, right?

2018
01:50:45,667 --> 01:50:46,958
You'll happily zip zap zoom

2019
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,042
'When I go for my vehicle's

'Take your hand off'

2023
01:50:59,917 --> 01:51:03,542
Sivakumar's phone # can be traced to
the tower near Tamabaram railway station

2024
01:51:16,125 --> 01:51:18,542
'Sivakumar is entering platform # 1'

2025
01:52:00,833 --> 01:52:02,292
The screen is blurred

2026
01:52:02,542 --> 01:52:03,625
Must be some error

2027
01:52:03,708 --> 01:52:05,375
Look at the next camera

Give me your documents

Who are you, sir?

2033
01:52:37,958 --> 01:52:39,292
Aren't you Sivakumar?

2034
01:52:39,333 --> 01:52:41,417
- Your documents
- I must give the files to him

2035
01:52:41,458 --> 01:52:43,250
- Do you want the loan or not?
- Yes, I do

2036
01:52:43,292 --> 01:52:45,875
Give me your documents
Make it fast, sir

2037
01:52:47,333 --> 01:52:49,125
Sivakumar is talking to someone

2038

Can't make out his face, sir

2039

Next camera

Hari, Sivakumar is talking to someone

2045
01:53:10,917 --> 01:53:12,125
'Identify the person'

2046
01:53:12,750 --> 01:53:14,042
Right, to your right

I'm going, sir'

Whom were you talking to?

2053
01:53:43,958 --> 01:53:45,792
He said he is from your team

2054
01:53:46,625 --> 01:53:49,042
- Where are the documents?
- He took all of them

2055

'How many people
have you conned till now?'

2065

Tell me

2066
01:54:42,833 --> 01:54:44,542
Who is the mastermind behind this?

2067
01:54:44,583 --> 01:54:45,958
- I'll tell you, sir
- Out with it

2068
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:49,208
I don't know who is behind
this entire network, sir

'I will be instructed to open shop
somewhere all of a sudden'

and ask if he wants a loan, sir'

2073
01:55:01,083 --> 01:55:03,958
Once the loan is processed
I have no link with them, sir

2074
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,708
'I have no idea where
 the cash is transferred to'

2075
01:55:06,750 --> 01:55:09,333
I don't get anything
other than that 10%, sir

2076
01:55:09,375 --> 01:55:11,625
'In your bank account
after 0.6 million is deposited'

2077
01:55:11,667 --> 01:55:13,750
'...give me a check for Rs 60,000
That is enough'

2078
01:55:13,750 --> 01:55:16,750
'Why didn't you deposit
my check in the bank?'

2079
01:55:16,792 --> 01:55:18,750
Why didn't you?
Answer me

2080
01:55:18,833 --> 01:55:21,083
Not only your check, sir

2081
01:55:21,250 --> 01:55:23,708
'I don't deposit
any of the checks, sir'

2082
01:55:25,708 --> 01:55:27,458
How can you transfer the money then?

2083
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:30,208
'A man will come to collect it
I swear I haven't even seen his face'

2084
01:55:30,250 --> 01:55:33,042
'He'll collect the check from me
and pay me the same amount by cash'

2085
01:55:33,083 --> 01:55:37,083
'He digitalizes your signature
on your check, sir'

2086
01:55:37,125 --> 01:55:38,500
'He takes your money'

2087
01:55:38,583 --> 01:55:40,417
I don't know anything else, sir

2088
01:55:45,667 --> 01:55:48,042
One fellow has poked my eyes
and blinded me

2089
01:55:51,042 --> 01:55:53,583
How many people have
we conned with that agent?

2090
01:55:55,250 --> 01:55:56,542
'18, sir'

2091
01:55:57,917 --> 01:55:59,750
These 18 people are frauds

2092
01:55:59,750 --> 01:56:01,917
'Documents they submitted are forged'

2093
01:56:01,958 --> 01:56:03,625
'File a complaint to the bank'

2094
01:56:03,708 --> 01:56:05,625
The banker will handle the rest

2095
01:56:08,208 --> 01:56:09,250
Tell me

2096
01:56:09,292 --> 01:56:11,917
'The shopkeeper from Ambattur
 called me just now'

2097
01:56:11,958 --> 01:56:14,083
'Someone from the bank
has enquired over there'

2098
01:56:14,125 --> 01:56:15,750
'They know it isn't our shop'

2099
01:56:15,792 --> 01:56:18,583
'Go straight to the bank and
find out what transpired'

2100
01:56:23,167 --> 01:56:24,667
Who are you, man?

2101
01:56:24,750 --> 01:56:26,417
- 1 minute
- What do you want?

2102
01:56:26,458 --> 01:56:28,792
My name is Kathir
Rangasamy's son

2103
01:56:28,833 --> 01:56:31,917
Oh! So you're the one who claimed
a loan with fake documents?

2104
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,750
Do we come across as imbeciles?

2105
01:56:38,208 --> 01:56:39,417
Keep this, sir

2106
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:42,542
Why are you giving me your gold chain?

2107
01:56:43,750 --> 01:56:46,417
I don't want to accept gold
from you, get me cash

2108
01:56:54,250 --> 01:56:56,292
I have 15,000 here, sir

2109
01:56:57,083 --> 01:56:58,583
Please take this

2110
01:56:58,667 --> 01:57:00,875
I'll give you 30 days grace time

2111
01:57:01,208 --> 01:57:03,042
Try to settle it by then

2112
01:57:03,167 --> 01:57:05,167
If you don't, you know
 the soup you'll be in

2113
01:57:10,208 --> 01:57:11,958
A goat gives birth to a baby boy

2114
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,375
Wretched fellows!
They didn't even spare a goat, huh?

2115
01:57:14,417 --> 01:57:16,417
'Bank scam by submitting
fake documents'

2116
01:57:16,458 --> 01:57:19,750
Listen, you weren't the only one
the bank interrogated yesterday

2117
01:57:19,750 --> 01:57:21,083
'17 others were checked'

2118
01:57:21,125 --> 01:57:22,750
Only you had a great escape

2119
01:57:24,125 --> 01:57:27,750
'They already know
all the information about you'

2120
01:57:27,833 --> 01:57:30,750
All these people who borrowed
may have gone abroad

2121
01:57:30,792 --> 01:57:32,250
'No one could have reached you'

2122
01:57:32,292 --> 01:57:34,708
'You could've performed
a Star-nite show happily'

2123
01:57:34,750 --> 01:57:39,833
All those 18 people have availed loans
with fake documents just like I did

2124
01:57:40,375 --> 01:57:44,250
From various private
international banks

2125
01:57:44,292 --> 01:57:48,875
But all the agents who persuaded us
to lie and submit fake documents

2126
01:57:49,583 --> 01:57:51,458
...are from the same network

2127
01:57:51,792 --> 01:57:53,417
They invade out privacy

2128
01:57:53,458 --> 01:57:56,542
'And target us knowing
our desperate need'

2129
01:57:56,792 --> 01:57:59,083
They buy details of so many like this

2130
01:57:59,125 --> 01:58:00,542
'He's the one I told you about'

2131
01:58:00,583 --> 01:58:02,167
Owns a Xerox shop in Ambattur

2132
01:58:02,208 --> 01:58:04,042
His business has been
a bit dull for a while

2133
01:58:04,083 --> 01:58:05,292
Can you help him out?

2134
01:58:05,375 --> 01:58:09,750
We have introduced an offer
as a Lucky Draw prize

2135
01:58:09,750 --> 01:58:12,000
'We collect all the details
from our customers'

2136
01:58:12,042 --> 01:58:17,125
We give it to a Xerox shopkeeper
before we submit it to our head office

2137
01:58:17,250 --> 01:58:18,792
'He will mint money out of this'

2138
01:58:18,833 --> 01:58:20,250
'It is very lucrative, bro'

2139
01:58:20,292 --> 01:58:22,458
If you meet him
your business will pick up

2140
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:24,917
Who wants to take
a photocopy nowadays?

2141
01:58:24,958 --> 01:58:28,792
With online facilities
a smart phone is enough

2142
01:58:28,833 --> 01:58:31,833
I can't even pay my electricity bill
with the 1 rupee I charge per copy!

2143
01:58:31,875 --> 01:58:34,542
We have to turn elsewhere
to make ends meet

2144
01:58:34,583 --> 01:58:38,958
That is 'Information Business'

2145
01:58:39,125 --> 01:58:45,750
'Don't we give the information required
for a Lucky Draw or a Bumper prize?'

2146
01:58:45,833 --> 01:58:51,042
If we duplicate all those details
we can sell 1 data for 1 rupee

2147
01:58:51,083 --> 01:58:53,792
50,000 data gets us Rs 50,000

2148
01:58:54,042 --> 01:58:59,417
We get clients who take photocopies of
ID, address proof and even certificates

2149
01:58:59,458 --> 01:59:02,000
'Without his knowledge
if we take a copy and sell...'

2150
01:59:02,083 --> 01:59:03,958
'...that fetches a totally different rate, sir'

2151
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,167
It gets even better

2152
01:59:05,208 --> 01:59:08,250
'We throw away our boarding pass
after we disembark from a plane'

2153
01:59:08,292 --> 01:59:10,208
'It has a QR code'

2154
01:59:10,292 --> 01:59:12,167
'If we scan that code...'

2155
01:59:12,208 --> 01:59:16,042
'...including his passport details,
contact # and the credit card used'

2156
01:59:16,083 --> 01:59:18,292
'...to buy this ticket and
his bank account details'

2157
01:59:18,333 --> 01:59:20,583
'...we can get the entire
horoscope of the passenger'

2158
01:59:20,625 --> 01:59:23,208
This fetches a huge amount, sir

2159
01:59:23,250 --> 01:59:25,208
Who will buy all this?

2160
01:59:25,250 --> 01:59:26,750
There are specific agents

2161
01:59:26,750 --> 01:59:30,750
'If we go through him to call centers,
we will be paid for all this information'

2162
01:59:30,792 --> 01:59:34,292
We get calls and messages
from call centers, right?

2163
01:59:34,333 --> 01:59:36,792
'Asking us to take a car loan
or a housing loan'

2164
01:59:36,833 --> 01:59:39,792
'Award, reward, offer,
trip, Thai massage'

2165
01:59:39,833 --> 01:59:41,667
'A deluge of messages'

2166
01:59:41,708 --> 01:59:44,542
Who do you think supplies
these call centers with information?

2167
01:59:44,583 --> 01:59:46,750
Only through us

2168
01:59:46,875 --> 01:59:49,625
'Whether it's a company
looking for new customers'

2169
01:59:49,708 --> 01:59:52,375
'...or any fraud conning
the general public'

2170
01:59:52,458 --> 01:59:56,125
'...all of them buy information
from call centers'

2171
01:59:56,167 --> 01:59:57,750
Is this how they call and ask?

2172
01:59:57,750 --> 02:00:00,083
'Do you want to buy land ?
Do you want to avail a loan?'

2173
02:00:00,167 --> 02:00:01,000
Yes

2174
02:00:01,042 --> 02:00:03,375
There are call centers
in every nook and cranny

2175
02:00:03,417 --> 02:00:07,125
It's a needle in a haystack!
How can we trace our source?

2176
02:00:08,708 --> 02:00:11,875
When was your last call
asking you to take a loan?

2177
02:00:12,250 --> 02:00:13,833
Think about it

2178
02:00:14,208 --> 02:00:16,917
I didn't get any call
after I applied for the loan

2179
02:00:17,042 --> 02:00:18,708
Not after you applied

2180
02:00:19,042 --> 02:00:21,417
Your calls stopped
after the loan was rejected

2181
02:00:22,083 --> 02:00:26,083
Didn't you say, rejection of loan
is the common factor for all 18 of you?

2182
02:00:26,292 --> 02:00:32,125
How did that network get this information
from the bank about the loan rejection?

2183
02:00:32,167 --> 02:00:36,417
Their loan gets rejected
for some reason or the other

2184
02:00:36,500 --> 02:00:38,792
No other bank will sanction
the loan for sure

2185
02:00:38,833 --> 02:00:40,875
So there's no use calling them

2186
02:00:40,917 --> 02:00:44,458
So we segregate the reject list
and send it to a BPO

2187
02:00:44,542 --> 02:00:48,083
'Those people in the list
won't be contacted after that'

2188
02:00:48,208 --> 02:00:51,542
'The 18 victims in your list
may have gone to different banks'

2189
02:00:51,583 --> 02:00:54,125
'But only 3 banks reject the loans'

2190
02:00:54,167 --> 02:00:56,833
'Those 3 banks have
a common call center'

2191
02:00:57,542 --> 02:00:59,875
'TTS in OMR'

2192
02:01:08,083 --> 02:01:09,417
'Hey! Jaga, where are you?'

2193
02:01:09,458 --> 02:01:11,792
I came through the front entrance
to the reception area

2194
02:01:11,833 --> 02:01:13,417
Are you in the 1st floor?

2195
02:01:14,708 --> 02:01:16,083
'First Manager is here'

2196
02:01:16,125 --> 02:01:17,750
Idiot! Tell me his name

2197
02:01:17,792 --> 02:01:18,833
Gopinath

2198
02:01:18,833 --> 02:01:21,042
Is 'Neeyaa Naana?' Gopinath
working here too?!

2199
02:01:21,125 --> 02:01:22,542
Okay, I'll handle it

2200
02:01:23,292 --> 02:01:26,000
'Shyam, did you meet Gopinath?'

2201
02:01:26,042 --> 02:01:27,833
'Did he panic reading my text?'

2202
02:01:29,375 --> 02:01:31,167
- 'Did he?'
- He isn't the one

2203
02:01:31,208 --> 02:01:33,125
Junk of a jerk!
Check the next person

2204
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:36,083
'Shyam, isn't she the one?'

2205
02:01:36,125 --> 02:01:37,167
'Urvashi is here'

2206
02:01:37,208 --> 02:01:39,375
'We'll gain something
Let's at least kidnap her'

2207
02:01:39,417 --> 02:01:40,667
Send the message

2208
02:01:40,708 --> 02:01:42,375
'I know
She's the one'

2209
02:01:42,458 --> 02:01:45,042
'Wait and watch
She'll fall into our trap'

2210
02:01:46,792 --> 02:01:48,625
'Did she read the message?'

2211
02:01:48,708 --> 02:01:50,208
'Give me some good news'

2212
02:01:50,417 --> 02:01:51,458
'Take her'

2213
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:53,083
- Shyam...Shyam
- Not her

2214
02:01:53,167 --> 02:01:54,417
She isn't the one it seems

2215
02:01:54,458 --> 02:01:56,000
I was so sure she's the one

2216
02:02:00,042 --> 02:02:01,917
'Send the message to Mohan'

2217
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:03,542
'Ditch him
He doesn't look good'

2218
02:02:03,583 --> 02:02:05,292
- Just send it
- I did...I did

2219
02:02:16,208 --> 02:02:17,875
What crap!

2220
02:02:26,250 --> 02:02:28,083
'Where is he going?'

2221
02:02:30,292 --> 02:02:32,292
He's going to the restroom
in the ground floor

2222
02:02:32,333 --> 02:02:34,792
Are you jobless to be jumping
from one loo to another?

2223
02:02:40,333 --> 02:02:41,458
Tell me

2224
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:45,042
Don't know who messaged
but he says I'm linked with you

2225
02:02:45,125 --> 02:02:47,000
Don't get flustered
What is the number?

2226
02:02:47,042 --> 02:02:48,542
Don't know
It is from a system

2227
02:02:48,583 --> 02:02:50,042
'This is very risky'

2228
02:02:50,083 --> 02:02:52,875
If this gets exposed
my life will go for a toss

2229
02:02:52,958 --> 02:02:55,750
Don't panic
Where are you now?

2230
02:02:55,792 --> 02:02:57,292
Washroom
In my office

2231
02:02:57,333 --> 02:02:59,667
Remove the sim from
your phone and flush it

2232
02:02:59,750 --> 02:03:02,250
A man will come now
Follow his instructions

2233
02:03:30,875 --> 02:03:32,208
I am sure he's our target

2234
02:03:32,250 --> 02:03:34,167
'He's heading towards the parking lot'

2235
02:03:52,792 --> 02:03:55,042
'You are in the wrong car
Come soon'

2236
02:03:55,083 --> 02:03:56,500
'Do something
We are doomed'

2237
02:03:56,542 --> 02:03:58,667
'Why are you screwing up?'

2238
02:03:58,708 --> 02:04:00,458
'What have you done?'

2239
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:02,833
Sir, you can't go this way
wearing a blue shirt!

2240
02:04:02,833 --> 02:04:03,833
Go that way

2241
02:04:03,875 --> 02:04:05,625
'Who are you?
Why are you stopping me?'

2242
02:04:05,667 --> 02:04:06,792
'Is this your parking lot?'

2243
02:04:06,833 --> 02:04:07,875
Did you pay GST?

2244
02:04:07,917 --> 02:04:09,708
'Paid your taxes?
You're an anti-Indian, sir'

2245
02:04:09,750 --> 02:04:10,875
'I am sending you in exile'

2246
02:04:10,917 --> 02:04:12,833
- Move aside
- 'I managed to buy you time'

2247
02:04:12,833 --> 02:04:15,167
I don't know what else
to say to stall him

2248
02:04:16,625 --> 02:04:18,750
Electrocuted head to toe, huh?

2249
02:04:34,167 --> 02:04:35,750
Take the next right

2250
02:04:41,667 --> 02:04:42,833
He has moved

2251
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,125
Here, stop...stop

2252
02:04:59,583 --> 02:05:00,833
Is the tracker right?

2253
02:05:00,833 --> 02:05:02,250
I can't see anyone?

2254
02:05:02,833 --> 02:05:03,917
Can't see, huh?

2255
02:05:16,833 --> 02:05:18,083
[lamb bleating]

2256
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,375
Don't move

2257
02:06:12,625 --> 02:06:13,667
Alright

2258
02:06:13,708 --> 02:06:16,417
Trespassing into military area

2259
02:06:19,458 --> 02:06:21,208
Are you big time terrorists?

2260
02:06:21,250 --> 02:06:22,750
We aren't terrorists, sir

2261
02:06:22,792 --> 02:06:24,208
You can be anyone

2262
02:06:24,333 --> 02:06:26,167
Let me tell you something
about our military

2263
02:06:26,208 --> 02:06:27,375
We shoot at sight

2264
02:06:27,417 --> 02:06:30,125
Only after the post mortem
we enquire about your identity

2265
02:06:30,167 --> 02:06:31,208
Therefore-

2266
02:06:36,083 --> 02:06:38,333
Why isn't anyone dead?

2267
02:06:39,750 --> 02:06:41,708
'I just now praised
our military sky high'

2268
02:06:41,750 --> 02:06:43,708
How long will it take to
change the bullets?

2269
02:06:43,750 --> 02:06:45,542
Oh yes! You're also a record holder

2270
02:06:45,583 --> 02:06:48,833
'You have 90 seconds
to blurt out your story'

2271
02:06:51,042 --> 02:06:52,917
'We trained as CBI officers'

2272
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,875
Our expertise is mainly
surveillance and tracking

2273
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,750
'The 4 of us are orphans, sir'

2274
02:06:57,833 --> 02:07:00,875
We were raised and educated
by Amarajyothi Educational Trust

2275
02:07:00,917 --> 02:07:04,625
Our chief correspondent
sent us for CBI training

2276
02:07:04,750 --> 02:07:07,917
We resigned our job
after our training

2277
02:07:07,958 --> 02:07:09,875
And we work only for him, sir

2278
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,583
'Kathir, didn't you get a hard disk
from Ritchie street?'

2279
02:07:17,625 --> 02:07:19,958
'I wasn't able to recover
all the files from it'

2280
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,083
'I could recover
only 4 audio files'

2281
02:07:22,125 --> 02:07:25,458
'One of those files is the founder
of Amara Jyothi Trust'

2282
02:07:25,833 --> 02:07:29,000
Looks like he and Sathyamurthy
have fallen out

2283
02:07:29,333 --> 02:07:32,250
We name our children
in our orphanage

2284
02:07:32,708 --> 02:07:34,708
We named him Sathyamurthy

2285
02:07:34,792 --> 02:07:37,167
But he has never revealed
his name to anyone

2286
02:07:37,458 --> 02:07:39,750
According to him
his identity is his roll #

2287
02:07:39,792 --> 02:07:42,833
That year was 1999
when Y2K was a big hassle

2288
02:07:42,875 --> 02:07:45,083
All the world banks were scared of Y2K

2289
02:07:45,125 --> 02:07:47,958
They changed their data
from hard drive to books

2290
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:52,208
'Tons of unused hard drives and
computers were disposed as trash'

2291
02:07:52,833 --> 02:07:55,583
No one knew its value
But only he realized it

2292
02:07:55,625 --> 02:07:57,792
He purchased all the unwanted computers

2293
02:07:57,833 --> 02:08:00,667
He came with 4 containers
of electronic waste

2294
02:08:00,667 --> 02:08:04,417
On his arrival he threatened us
and got the Trust signed in his name

2295
02:08:04,500 --> 02:08:07,292
Then he has opened a warehouse
in the name of the Trust

2296
02:08:07,375 --> 02:08:10,083
Using the data backup
in all the hard disks

2297
02:08:10,125 --> 02:08:14,542
'...he created an user name 'White Devil'
and started an extensive network'

2298
02:08:14,583 --> 02:08:16,583
After the Trust was
transferred in his name...

2299
02:08:16,625 --> 02:08:18,500
...cash flowed in
from unknown sources

2300
02:08:18,542 --> 02:08:20,083
'After a while I got scared'

2301
02:08:20,125 --> 02:08:22,958
I badgered him about
the activities of the trust

2302
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,667
'Suddenly I found a blank check
with his signature in my place'

2303
02:08:25,667 --> 02:08:27,083
'I rang up and asked him about it'

2304
02:08:27,125 --> 02:08:29,750
'Fill whatever amount you want'
he said, with utmost temerity

2305
02:08:29,792 --> 02:08:32,833
'I told him he can't buy me
and I would complain to the police'

2306
02:08:32,875 --> 02:08:36,833
'He asked me to check
the wall clock in my daughter's bedroom'

2307
02:08:36,958 --> 02:08:38,750
'And asked me to open it'

2308
02:08:39,458 --> 02:08:40,958
'There was a camera inside'

2309
02:08:41,167 --> 02:08:42,833
'He had recorded everything'

2310
02:08:42,917 --> 02:08:44,792
He ruined my daughter's life

2311
02:08:45,875 --> 02:08:48,083
I've never met anyone
as ruthless as him, son

2312
02:08:48,125 --> 02:08:51,458
'Without knowing his true colors
Unicef is singing his praises'

2313
02:09:40,208 --> 02:09:41,417
You scared me

2314
02:09:43,417 --> 02:09:45,042
Why this unnecessary build up?

2315
02:09:45,333 --> 02:09:47,125
I saw you in the lobby too

2316
02:09:47,583 --> 02:09:48,958
You planned it well

2317
02:09:54,167 --> 02:09:57,625
Major Kathiravan, how much
did I steal from you?

2318
02:09:57,708 --> 02:10:00,958
I think it's Rs 1025000

2319
02:10:07,375 --> 02:10:10,000
Your money will be deposited
in your account now

2320
02:10:15,708 --> 02:10:17,250
Okay, let me confess

2321
02:10:17,292 --> 02:10:19,292
So far I have stolen 8 billion

2322
02:10:19,417 --> 02:10:24,417
In our country whether you rob Rs 8,
8000 or 8 billion, the case is the same

2323
02:10:26,583 --> 02:10:28,958
I am a 420 case
But who are you?

2324
02:10:29,417 --> 02:10:31,125
You have cheated the Govt

2325
02:10:32,875 --> 02:10:35,625
I have cheated 10,000 people
Including you

2326
02:10:35,667 --> 02:10:38,542
Every single one of them
has cheated the Govt

2327
02:10:38,583 --> 02:10:40,750
You'll be behind bars
for 18 months

2328
02:10:40,792 --> 02:10:42,208
I don't have a problem

2329
02:10:42,250 --> 02:10:43,708
Once I come out...

2330
02:10:43,750 --> 02:10:46,625
...my money will be safe
in my Trust account

2331
02:10:47,292 --> 02:10:48,833
No one can touch it

2332
02:10:48,875 --> 02:10:51,333
But poor souls!
These 1000 victims

2333
02:10:52,708 --> 02:10:53,833
If they go to jail once...

2334
02:10:53,875 --> 02:10:56,042
...they will be so ashamed
they would rather die

2335
02:10:56,083 --> 02:10:58,375
There are many consequences like this

2336
02:11:02,458 --> 02:11:06,042
If a robber is stung by a scorpion
he has to bear the pain in silence

2337
02:11:07,167 --> 02:11:08,792
All of you are the robbers

2338
02:11:09,375 --> 02:11:10,583
I am the scorpion

2339
02:11:10,875 --> 02:11:12,250
If I sting...

2340
02:11:12,292 --> 02:11:13,958
...you have to just zip your lips

2341
02:11:14,083 --> 02:11:15,792
Do you intend shooting me?

2342
02:11:17,667 --> 02:11:19,125
Even if you kill me...

2343
02:11:19,167 --> 02:11:21,833
...I have no family
to shed a tear for me

2344
02:11:22,167 --> 02:11:25,167
Are you wondering why a solitary man
is amassing so much money?

2345
02:11:25,208 --> 02:11:27,792
You want to know
why I am conning so many people

2346
02:11:29,333 --> 02:11:30,667
Because I can do so

2347
02:11:32,750 --> 02:11:36,583
You kidnapped my agent
I knew this 3 days ago

2348
02:11:37,083 --> 02:11:39,708
'You dodged the CCTV cameras
ever so smartly'

2349
02:11:40,333 --> 02:11:42,542
'You stupidly got caught in a selfie!'

2350
02:11:43,542 --> 02:11:44,583
What's your plan?

2351
02:11:44,625 --> 02:11:47,167
As soon as you get a gun
will you point it to my forehead?

2352
02:11:47,208 --> 02:11:51,750
Only after you know your quarry inside out
you should touch his foundation

2353
02:11:57,417 --> 02:11:59,708
I know you better than you know yourself

2354
02:12:00,250 --> 02:12:02,417
Do you know where
your sister is now?

2355
02:12:03,292 --> 02:12:04,500
I know

2356
02:12:04,667 --> 02:12:07,542
'Only a while ago she got off the bus
in Koyambedu bus stand'

2357
02:12:07,583 --> 02:12:10,250
'She sat in the auto with
the registration # 8203'

2358
02:12:10,583 --> 02:12:12,750
Suddenly the driver
abandoned the auto

2359
02:12:12,792 --> 02:12:15,500
'...right in the middle
of the road and ran away'

2360
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:20,292
Before your sister could
even gather up her wits-

2361
02:12:22,417 --> 02:12:23,542
My boys

2362
02:12:24,083 --> 02:12:29,208
In 5 minutes if I'm not there
they won't rush your sister to a hospital

2363
02:12:29,625 --> 02:12:31,542
Her destination will be somewhere else!

2364
02:12:32,542 --> 02:12:34,250
Shall I operate the lift?

2365
02:12:36,542 --> 02:12:39,792
Kathir, do you know
what's a flagged account?

2366
02:12:40,542 --> 02:12:43,417
The bank account used by terrorists

2367
02:12:43,625 --> 02:12:47,708
When they finish their work
they leave behind a sizeable amount

2368
02:12:48,375 --> 02:12:50,458
Will anyone touch that account?

2369
02:12:50,625 --> 02:12:52,958
Can any link be traced
between him and the terrorist?

2370
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:59,667
Anti-terrorist squad, CBI, Indian military
will be watching vigilantly

2371
02:13:00,708 --> 02:13:05,750
Only from such an account
I've transferred the amount to you now

2372
02:13:08,292 --> 02:13:10,583
You are a person who hates India

2373
02:13:13,667 --> 02:13:14,875
As far as I know

2374
02:13:14,958 --> 02:13:17,417
...you'll be caught within 45 minutes

2375
02:13:18,250 --> 02:13:23,083
If possible by then go and 
visit your sister in the hospital

2376
02:13:52,292 --> 02:13:54,292
Where is the Emergency ward?

2377
02:13:58,375 --> 02:14:01,542
"Who is this mastermind unmatchable?"

2378
02:14:01,583 --> 02:14:05,708
"From a mighty pillar to a minUte particle
his hawk-eyes scrutinize every article"

2379
02:14:05,750 --> 02:14:08,667
"From azure skies extensive
Aquamarine seas expansive"

2380
02:14:08,708 --> 02:14:10,417
"To land and minds all pervasive"

2381
02:14:10,417 --> 02:14:11,833
- How is Selvi?
- Too early to tell

2382
02:14:11,875 --> 02:14:13,833
"He has his ears to the ground intensive"

2383
02:14:13,875 --> 02:14:20,792
"Into closed ears discreetly
whisper to the wind quietly"

2384
02:14:20,833 --> 02:14:27,833
"Even if words spoken in ordinary tone
Words get trapped in his black hole zone"

2385
02:14:27,917 --> 02:14:31,417
"Wherever you hide, windows have eyes too"

2386
02:14:31,458 --> 02:14:35,042
"Walls have ears, whomever you talk to"

2387
02:14:35,083 --> 02:14:38,792
"If hands raised to extort
violence can be the last resort"

2388
02:14:38,833 --> 02:14:40,792
"But greed being the binding tie"

2389
02:14:40,833 --> 02:14:42,958
"He has betrayed me; on the sly"

2390
02:14:43,042 --> 02:14:45,750
"Who is this man unbeatable?"

2391
02:14:45,833 --> 02:14:49,958
"From a mighty pillar to a minUte particle
his xray-eyes scan every single article"

2392
02:14:50,042 --> 02:14:53,250
"From grey skies to blue seas"

2393
02:14:53,333 --> 02:14:57,875
"Latitudes & mental aptitudes, he perceives
With his ears to the ground he deceives"

2394
02:15:13,875 --> 02:15:15,750
You aren't linked
with any terrorist gang

2395
02:15:15,792 --> 02:15:18,208
But you've taken money
for your sister's wedding

2396
02:15:18,292 --> 02:15:19,875
'...from a flagged account'

2397
02:15:27,417 --> 02:15:31,125
"Your disguise has been exposed now"

2398
02:15:31,167 --> 02:15:34,667
"Look up to the skies; to the Force above"

2399
02:15:34,750 --> 02:15:41,583
"Innocent men are a rare species
Pay back the loan to the bank please"

2400
02:15:41,625 --> 02:15:45,292
"Game played long ago rebounds
Crouching in some nook to pounce"

2401
02:15:45,333 --> 02:15:49,000
"After you are trac(k)ed, finally
Game over, well and truly"

2402
02:15:49,083 --> 02:15:52,625
"Only when we hunted high and low
to find his hideout somehow"

2403
02:15:52,667 --> 02:15:56,417
"We realized the laughter
of this abstract monster"

2404
02:15:56,500 --> 02:16:00,167
"Who is this man illusive?"

2405
02:16:10,417 --> 02:16:13,125
I've told Kesavan
about our predicament

2406
02:16:13,167 --> 02:16:15,833
They have agreed for a simple wedding

2407
02:16:15,958 --> 02:16:18,583
From when you started helping me

2408
02:16:18,958 --> 02:16:21,417
...I got back a sense of belonging

2409
02:16:21,958 --> 02:16:25,333
If I get my brother back safe and sound
that's enough for me

2410
02:16:25,375 --> 02:16:28,417
I don't want our family to split
all because of money

2411
02:16:35,750 --> 02:16:37,750
'I know you better
than you know yourself'

2412
02:16:37,792 --> 02:16:42,625
'Only after you know your quarry inside out
you should touch his foundation'

2413
02:16:42,750 --> 02:16:45,583
'Find out every single detail
about him from A to Z'

2414
02:16:46,167 --> 02:16:48,875
'He is looked up with respect
by the general public'

2415
02:16:48,958 --> 02:16:51,292
He is popular on Youtube

2416
02:16:55,708 --> 02:16:57,083
'Long live India!'

2417
02:17:02,083 --> 02:17:04,208
He is our Telecom minister
Mr Vijaya Rajan

2418
02:17:04,292 --> 02:17:07,542
Is he the one who said he will
block the sun using thermocol?

2419
02:17:07,583 --> 02:17:08,958
Not that man, uncle

2420
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:12,792
Something has transpired
between this minister and White Devil

2421
02:17:13,208 --> 02:17:14,667
Did you see how petrified he is?

2422
02:17:14,708 --> 02:17:18,208
Then the minister has been
caught red-handed by White Devil

2423
02:17:18,250 --> 02:17:21,542
Even then what is he expecting
from the Telecom minister?

2424
02:17:22,625 --> 02:17:25,875
'He digitalizes your signature
on your check, sir'

2425
02:17:25,958 --> 02:17:27,333
'He takes your money'

2426
02:17:27,375 --> 02:17:30,000
'No one knew its value
But only he realized it'

2427
02:17:30,083 --> 02:17:32,000
'You are after all just a number'

2428
02:17:38,792 --> 02:17:40,625
What will he do with all this?

2429
02:17:40,667 --> 02:17:43,958
The way all of us assume
Aadhar card isn't a basic ID card

2430
02:17:44,375 --> 02:17:49,083
Your biometrics, from your fingerprints
to your retinal scan, it's your master-card!

2431
02:17:54,625 --> 02:17:57,167
You are giving me the shivers

2432
02:17:57,208 --> 02:17:59,083
My intention is not to make you panic

2433
02:17:59,333 --> 02:18:00,792
I am just predicting the future

2434
02:18:04,083 --> 02:18:09,667
'His plan is to extract
all our information'

2435
02:18:12,333 --> 02:18:14,708
What do you mean?
All this is going above my head

2436
02:18:29,500 --> 02:18:32,417
So far he was only hacking our phones

2437
02:18:32,917 --> 02:18:35,333
Now he will hack our lives

2438
02:19:14,667 --> 02:19:16,375
He wants my fingerprint, eh?

2439
02:19:16,417 --> 02:19:18,125
If I face some problem
because of this?

2440
02:19:18,167 --> 02:19:20,167
Just do it, sir
It's 6 billion

2441
02:20:05,333 --> 02:20:06,583
Who the hell is she?

2442
02:20:06,625 --> 02:20:07,958
'You swore I am very safe'

2443
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:09,542
How is she here then?

2444
02:20:09,583 --> 02:20:10,667
Sir, you leave

2445
02:20:10,708 --> 02:20:12,208
- Let's go, sir
- Please take him

2446
02:20:12,250 --> 02:20:13,833
- Let's go
- Don't be scared

2447
02:20:13,875 --> 02:20:15,625
'She may be from the media'

2448
02:20:19,125 --> 02:20:20,417
Who the hell are you?

2449
02:20:22,667 --> 02:20:24,917
Journalist?
Check her bag

2450
02:20:27,292 --> 02:20:28,500
Income tax, huh?

2451
02:20:29,500 --> 02:20:30,958
Check if her GPS is switched on

2452
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:32,625
- Yes, bro
- Smash it to pieces

2453
02:20:35,250 --> 02:20:36,958
'Are you sure I won't be in a soup?'

2454
02:20:38,250 --> 02:20:40,000
Our boys are very sharp

2455
02:20:40,083 --> 02:20:41,542
They will handle her

2456
02:20:46,208 --> 02:20:47,500
Who are you?

2457
02:20:47,917 --> 02:20:49,125
Who sent you?

2458
02:20:49,458 --> 02:20:51,292
Why did you follow the minister?

2459
02:20:51,792 --> 02:20:53,250
Say something

2460
02:20:54,167 --> 02:20:56,625
Listen, we won't threaten you

2461
02:20:58,833 --> 02:21:01,500
We will strip you
without a stitch on you

2462
02:21:02,250 --> 02:21:03,583
And click just 1 photo

2463
02:21:03,625 --> 02:21:04,833
Then we will send you

2464
02:21:04,875 --> 02:21:07,083
If this matter leaks out...

2465
02:21:07,125 --> 02:21:10,292
...the very next minute
we will upload your photo online

2466
02:21:10,333 --> 02:21:13,375
It will be zoomed and millions
will drool over every inch of your body

2467
02:21:13,417 --> 02:21:14,583
Give it a thought

2468
02:21:14,625 --> 02:21:16,583
Your dignity will be tattered to shreds

2469
02:21:17,250 --> 02:21:19,125
You heard me

2470
02:21:19,208 --> 02:21:21,083
Aren't you even the least bit scared?

2471
02:21:21,125 --> 02:21:22,583
Say something, damn you

2472
02:21:22,625 --> 02:21:25,083
Beg me to let you go

2473
02:21:25,833 --> 02:21:28,792
Open your mouth and talk
What do you have in your mouth?

2474
02:23:42,583 --> 02:23:43,833
Greetings, Big boss!

2475
02:23:44,333 --> 02:23:46,667
Is that foreign 'seer' called Vladimir?

2476
02:23:46,792 --> 02:23:50,167
What happens if you let half baked devotees
from Pondicherry handle your system?

2477
02:23:50,208 --> 02:23:52,333
That's why I sent him to hell

2478
02:23:52,375 --> 02:23:53,833
'And brought his laptop'

2479
02:23:59,917 --> 02:24:02,833
Have you forgotten
your family and friends?

2480
02:24:02,917 --> 02:24:04,458
I didn't forget, boss

2481
02:24:04,500 --> 02:24:06,833
'Generally I never forget
those who are good to me'

2482
02:24:06,875 --> 02:24:09,167
You've been good...for nothing!

2483
02:24:09,250 --> 02:24:10,417
How can I forget?

2484
02:24:10,458 --> 02:24:11,833
'You are intelligent'

2485
02:24:11,875 --> 02:24:14,542
'You know to collect data from the system'

2486
02:24:14,583 --> 02:24:16,292
But I am from the military academy

2487
02:24:16,333 --> 02:24:19,417
I know to extract information
from the inside of a man's brain

2488
02:24:19,458 --> 02:24:22,625
Before you get to know anything
I will come right now

2489
02:24:22,667 --> 02:24:23,917
...to your venue

2490
02:24:26,167 --> 02:24:29,500
Try refreshing the screen in front of you

2491
02:24:35,792 --> 02:24:37,167
Not copy, boss

2492
02:24:37,208 --> 02:24:38,333
Education

2493
02:24:38,375 --> 02:24:40,875
'This is one of the skills
you taught me, boss'

2494
02:24:40,917 --> 02:24:42,792
Now I have another
ace up my sleeve too

2495
02:24:42,833 --> 02:24:44,042
Shall I download that too?

2496
02:24:44,083 --> 02:24:47,458
'Whose money do you think
is transferred to your account now?'

2497
02:24:47,542 --> 02:24:49,667
Tamil Nadu police

2498
02:24:49,708 --> 02:24:53,792
'Using your network I captured
Tamil Nadu police's salary account'

2499
02:24:53,875 --> 02:24:56,375
'Right from the constable level
to DGP and the higher ups'

2500
02:24:56,417 --> 02:24:59,583
'...everyone will be in a state of panic
about their missing salary'

2501
02:24:59,667 --> 02:25:02,292
'The entire amount
is in your account now'

2502
02:25:02,333 --> 02:25:05,583
'Cyber crime would have started
digging into it by now'

2503
02:25:07,792 --> 02:25:09,542
Tamil Nadu Police

2504
02:25:09,625 --> 02:25:12,417
'Within 3 hours
you will be nabbed'

2505
02:25:12,542 --> 02:25:14,167
Trace the culprit, sir

2506
02:25:14,750 --> 02:25:18,250
If possible try to escape
before they get you

2507
02:25:20,708 --> 02:25:23,417
'I thought of you only as
a mere number till now'

2508
02:25:24,042 --> 02:25:26,083
Only now you are a face to me

2509
02:25:26,792 --> 02:25:28,583
'I underestimated you'

2510
02:25:53,583 --> 02:25:56,208
'What are you up to when
you should be tracing the culprit?'

2511
02:25:56,250 --> 02:25:58,333
The monitor is flashing
the letters 'I love you'

2512
02:25:59,333 --> 02:26:01,583
- The entire police software has crashed
- How?

2513
02:26:04,500 --> 02:26:07,250
Police task force can't take any action
for the next 48 hours, Major

2514
02:26:07,333 --> 02:26:08,708
But if we let go of him today

2515
02:26:08,750 --> 02:26:11,292
...no one can even sniff
the scent of White Devil

2516
02:26:14,792 --> 02:26:16,708
All my accounts have been compromised

2517
02:26:21,500 --> 02:26:22,667
Dispose all the records

2518
02:26:22,708 --> 02:26:24,750
Not even the smallest clue
should be found

2519
02:26:28,458 --> 02:26:32,375
Mobilize all my illegal funds
from all educational institutions

2520
02:26:32,417 --> 02:26:35,417
Bring the entire booty tonight
Not less than 6 billion

2521
02:26:50,958 --> 02:26:53,167
I don't know you
from this moment onwards

2522
02:26:53,875 --> 02:26:55,000
This car is yours

2523
02:28:06,667 --> 02:28:09,042
You'll need this hereafter
to relieve your stress

2524
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,167
All this was stolen from us, right?

2525
02:28:13,542 --> 02:28:15,583
Boss, you proposed to me over there

2526
02:28:15,625 --> 02:28:17,875
And now you are standing
all by yourself here

2527
02:28:17,958 --> 02:28:19,958
Don't I have to reciprocate?

2528
02:28:21,708 --> 02:28:24,500
Even I thought it will be
really tough to hunt you down

2529
02:28:24,542 --> 02:28:26,167
But it was a cakewalk!

2530
02:28:26,208 --> 02:28:30,167
You asked your men to bring
all the money you looted in your Trust bus

2531
02:28:30,250 --> 02:28:33,250
High and mighty, you were
so sure I can't trace or track you

2532
02:28:33,375 --> 02:28:36,875
Now you're well and truly caught
with all your evidence intact, White Devil

2533
02:28:37,917 --> 02:28:40,000
You bought these during Y2K, right?

2534
02:28:40,042 --> 02:28:42,792
You used these computers
to con all of us whole scale

2535
02:28:42,833 --> 02:28:45,292
Shall we close your chapter
where it all started?

2536
02:28:45,583 --> 02:28:48,333
I have shared this location in
WhatsApp with the police

2537
02:28:50,208 --> 02:28:52,500
You told me to touch
the base root of a person...

2538
02:28:52,583 --> 02:28:54,625
...only after knowing
his plus and minus

2539
02:28:54,667 --> 02:28:55,917
I took your advice

2540
02:29:17,500 --> 02:29:20,083
This isn't my nucleus

2541
02:29:21,083 --> 02:29:22,625
It is in here

2542
02:29:40,208 --> 02:29:43,042
I know how to earn this money back

2543
02:29:43,417 --> 02:29:46,167
Fingerprints of men like you
are in the palm of my hand!

2544
02:29:51,083 --> 02:29:53,125
'Using the minister's fingerprint
as access point'

2545
02:29:53,208 --> 02:29:56,750
'I have already usurped all your details'

2546
02:29:58,292 --> 02:29:59,833
From this moment onwards

2547
02:29:59,875 --> 02:30:03,375
I will decide which ballot box
the vote you cast will fall into!

2548
02:30:03,458 --> 02:30:05,417
I will be the king maker

2549
02:30:32,125 --> 02:30:33,375
Howdy, Military?

2550
02:30:33,458 --> 02:30:36,125
Did your training
vanish into thin air?

2551
02:30:37,500 --> 02:30:38,750
'Look over there'

2552
02:30:39,083 --> 02:30:41,125
'All your evidence is burnt to cinders'

2553
02:30:44,667 --> 02:30:46,375
Ask your police to enter

2554
02:30:46,417 --> 02:30:47,833
'Let them come in now'

2555
02:30:47,958 --> 02:30:49,875
And smear this ash on their faces

2556
02:30:55,042 --> 02:30:58,750
My dear boss, don't you always repeat
'Information is wealth'?

2557
02:30:59,333 --> 02:31:03,042
Won't you check if the information
you get is right or wrong?

2558
02:31:03,083 --> 02:31:05,083
What can the police force do to you?

2559
02:31:05,125 --> 02:31:07,625
'Maximum damage can be
charging you with a 420 case'

2560
02:31:07,708 --> 02:31:10,667
Who will answer the people
who were conned by you?

2561
02:31:11,042 --> 02:31:15,125
That's why along with the police force
I've brought all the victims you conned

2562
02:31:15,208 --> 02:31:17,667
'In your lingo
it's numbers'

2563
02:31:24,708 --> 02:31:28,417
I have changed all the numbers
in your head to faces now

2564
02:31:28,458 --> 02:31:33,625
'I sent a message from your Trust
stating their money has been returned'

2565
02:31:33,708 --> 02:31:36,875
'Everyone rushed to the bank
in eager anticipation'

2566
02:31:37,417 --> 02:31:40,792
'Only then they came to know
they had received only a message'

2567
02:31:40,833 --> 02:31:42,375
'Not their missing money'

2568
02:31:42,417 --> 02:31:44,417
'Their fury mounted to a murderous level'

2569
02:31:44,833 --> 02:31:48,875
'Only then I sent this location
in WhatsApp to all of them'

2570
02:31:50,708 --> 02:31:52,792
They are eagerly waiting to see you

2571
02:31:53,833 --> 02:31:55,792
No one knows
the identity of White Devil

2572
02:31:55,875 --> 02:31:59,042
But everyone knows Sathyamurthy
the owner of Amara Jyothi Trust

2573
02:31:59,083 --> 02:32:00,625
Why are you looking dazed?

2574
02:32:00,667 --> 02:32:02,875
White Devil and Sathyamurthy
are one and the same

2575
02:32:02,917 --> 02:32:04,792
I've proved to every single soul

2576
02:33:12,042 --> 02:33:13,583
Major Kathiravan

2577
02:33:14,250 --> 02:33:16,875
Do you intend opening that door?

2578
02:33:17,375 --> 02:33:19,292
What will they come here and do?

2579
02:33:19,333 --> 02:33:21,125
'Their money is anyway burnt'

2580
02:33:21,250 --> 02:33:24,417
On seeing the charred mess, in sheer
frustration they will pound me to a pulp

2581
02:33:24,417 --> 02:33:26,792
Then they will forget me
and even forget you

2582
02:33:26,875 --> 02:33:30,208
They will remember only the interest
to be paid at the end of the month

2583
02:33:31,417 --> 02:33:34,625
They cheated the bank to
avail a loan come hell or high water

2584
02:33:35,417 --> 02:33:37,792
They won't hesitate or
be scared even to steal

2585
02:33:38,167 --> 02:33:40,083
If you open the door now...

2586
02:33:40,250 --> 02:33:43,625
...you can get the laurels
for creating 10,000 robbers

2587
02:33:43,667 --> 02:33:46,042
Do you want that credit, my dear boy?

2588
02:33:51,958 --> 02:33:53,167
You're right, man

2589
02:33:53,375 --> 02:33:56,875
Every single soul out there lied
to avail a loan including me

2590
02:33:57,708 --> 02:33:59,792
Somehow I have to conduct
my sister's wedding

2591
02:33:59,833 --> 02:34:01,958
Somehow I must educate my child

2592
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,417
Despite being stout hearted
and strong enough to work...

2593
02:34:04,417 --> 02:34:07,583
...though penniless he wants
to save his bed-ridden father

2594
02:34:07,667 --> 02:34:11,667
...a heartless person like you convinces us
we can achieve the impossible if we lie

2595
02:34:11,708 --> 02:34:13,292
Then he will definitely lie, I say

2596
02:34:13,333 --> 02:34:15,000
He WILL avail a loan

2597
02:34:15,708 --> 02:34:18,083
If you brand that as 'robbery'

2598
02:34:18,417 --> 02:34:20,083
...it is not a crime at all

2599
02:34:21,708 --> 02:34:24,750
But we will bend backwards
and pay back our loan somehow

2600
02:34:24,833 --> 02:34:28,500
Because our society is
mostly made up of people like me

2601
02:34:29,167 --> 02:34:30,708
The money you burnt

2602
02:34:31,792 --> 02:34:33,500
That doesn't belong to them

2603
02:34:34,417 --> 02:34:36,000
You made a deal with the minister

2604
02:34:36,083 --> 02:34:38,250
'Just do it, sir
It's 6 billion'

2605
02:34:40,083 --> 02:34:41,708
That is now in my hands

2606
02:34:47,542 --> 02:34:50,792
Without my authorization
no one can touch that money

2607
02:34:52,625 --> 02:34:54,208
Do you remember this?

2608
02:34:55,417 --> 02:34:57,875
'Is that blank check still with you?'

2609
02:34:57,917 --> 02:34:59,167
Yes, my son

2610
02:34:59,833 --> 02:35:02,833
The digital signature you used
to transfer our money...

2611
02:35:03,417 --> 02:35:04,750
...I used the same method

2612
02:35:04,792 --> 02:35:06,667
'...to retrieve what you looted'

2613
02:35:10,417 --> 02:35:14,625
The other day you told me you can steal
because you have the capacity to do so

2614
02:35:14,792 --> 02:35:16,333
'Now let me tell you'

2615
02:35:16,833 --> 02:35:18,625
I will open this 'Iron Curtain' now

2616
02:35:19,958 --> 02:35:21,292
Because...

2617
02:35:21,667 --> 02:35:23,083
...I can do so

2618
02:36:02,875 --> 02:36:05,208
Joseph, send the money to everyone

2619
02:36:30,500 --> 02:36:34,167
'Nowadays a thief does not
need your key to break in'

2620
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,333
'A small piece of information
about you will do'

2621
02:37:19,083 --> 02:37:20,833
'Sounds good to hear?'

2622
02:37:25,208 --> 02:37:27,750
'2nd point in your bank application'

2623
02:37:27,792 --> 02:37:32,917
'No one will call you from your bank
and ask you for your account details'

2624
02:37:33,333 --> 02:37:36,667
'But if someone calls offering a loan
that is more than enough'

2625
02:37:36,833 --> 02:37:40,958
'You'll hand your account #, ATM pin,
even OTP and your Aadhar card details'

2626
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,250
'...on a golden platter
to a random stranger'

2627
02:37:43,917 --> 02:37:48,125
'Whenever you download an application
or a software and install it'

2628
02:37:48,167 --> 02:37:51,250
'...you readily agree to
all the terms specified'

2629
02:37:51,292 --> 02:37:53,000
'Your phone becomes smart'

2630
02:37:53,042 --> 02:37:54,667
'You become stupid!'

2631
02:37:54,708 --> 02:37:56,500
'Your phone comes
with a camera, that's all'

2632
02:37:56,542 --> 02:37:58,083
'That's what you think'

2633
02:37:58,458 --> 02:38:01,042
'For hackers like us it is our third eye'

2634
02:38:01,292 --> 02:38:05,042
'Without your knowledge, we utilize
your camera to peep into your life'

2635
02:38:06,167 --> 02:38:07,667
'Like 'Bigg Boss' show'

2636
02:38:08,042 --> 02:38:09,417
'You can't escape'

2637
02:38:09,458 --> 02:38:11,042
'Neither can you hide'

2638
02:38:11,292 --> 02:38:14,583
'An individual's Google Search History
is like his subconscious mind'

2639
02:38:14,667 --> 02:38:17,417
'You think no one has seen it
and you delete it to cover your tracks'

2640
02:38:17,458 --> 02:38:18,500
'I know that'

2641
02:38:18,542 --> 02:38:20,083
'I am like your conscience'

2642
02:38:20,708 --> 02:38:22,250
'Let me tell you this now'

2643
02:38:22,542 --> 02:38:24,792
'Not one of you is perfect'

2644
02:38:24,958 --> 02:38:27,125
'You sold your votes
claiming it is free'

2645
02:38:27,500 --> 02:38:30,125
'When you hear the word 'Offer'
don't sell your soul or yourself'

2646
02:38:30,167 --> 02:38:31,583
'Long live India!'

2647
