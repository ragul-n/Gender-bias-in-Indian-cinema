1
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,530
Don't take my mother away from me!

2
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,380
You've protected our village
for thousands of years.

3
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,740
We tried our best to save you
for two years, but we've lost...

4
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:58,170
Brother, we aren't leaving her.
We're taking Mother with us.

5
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,640
CBI Special Director Mr Dhananjay Rawat
is waiting for you, sir.

6
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,310
- Send him in.
- Sir.

7
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,180
- Good morning, Sir.
- Morning.

8
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,820
It's been a while since we met...

9
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,290
Tell me. What can I do for you?

10
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,390
There's a problem, Rawat.

11
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,320
Welcome to 'Face the People'.

12
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,750
The topic for today's show is
'Disappearing Gods'.

13
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,280
While our faith is mocked
and temple idols are stolen

14
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,660
our state ministers have themselves
gone missing.

15
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,990
However, this 'mute' government's
Minister of Water Resources

16
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:54,360
Mr Ishwar Prasad is here today to answer
questions from the public.

17
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,850
Does your government only open
its mouth to yawn?

18
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,650
Sir, in the last 6 months

19
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,480
ancient and priceless idols have been
stolen from 12 temples in our state.

20
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,020
Isn't the Endowment ministry
under your government's Chief Minister?

21
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,750
Surely he must be aware of these thefts?

22
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,760
They won't do anything!

23
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,610
This is a blatant attack on Hindutva!

24
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,730
If this was a minority issue,
they would bend over to appease them!

25
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,870
Our God can protect himself!

26
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:25,140
"When evil flourishes,
God shall manifest himself!"

27
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,270
People have the right to question
their leaders in a democracy.

28
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,260
And it is our responsibility
to answer them.

29
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:40,630
Our people face a constant
onslaught of adversities.

30
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,790
Just as one crisis ends, another begins.

31
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,290
The only thing that gives them solace
is God.

32
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,600
And when they open their eyes
after praying at the temple...

33
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,140
They find their God's idol
has disappeared.

34
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:01,800
I'm ashamed that I'm part
of this incompetent government.

35
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,790
What are you doing about
the idol thefts, Sir?

36
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,070
You should be asking this question
to our Chief Minister...

37
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,650
If within 15 days,
the thieves aren't caught

38
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,130
And the idols aren't re-installed
in the temples...

39
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,240
I'll resign from my position as minister.

40
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,940
Everyone knows how spineless
politicians are these days.

41
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,610
Cut out the fake drama.

42
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,890
I can't speak on behalf
of all politicians...

43
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,940
But I'm always ready to resign
if I fail in my duties.

44
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,820
Are you really trying to serve God,

45
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,280
or your own ambition of becoming
Chief Minister?

46
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,840
So that's what you're thinking.

47
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,640
Fine...

48
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,220
I won't resign then.

49
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,670
I'll quit politics altogether.

50
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,840
No, Sir! You can't quit!

51
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,180
And then your son will take your place.

52
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,240
Well played, Sir!

53
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,880
Thank you.

54
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:03,920
You just reminded me...

55
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,060
I entered politics to bring change.

56
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,160
Ajay.

57
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,070
- Ajay.
- He's not my son.

58
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,600
Ajay, he's calling you...

59
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,670
I was an ordinary party worker
when I started.

60
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,180
I would want my heir to belong
to the masses.

61
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,160
Ajay's the son of a poor farmer.

62
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,230
He has no political background.

63
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:32,210
He just wants to serve society.

64
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,950
He has a real passion and zeal

65
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,990
To do something for his people.

66
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,710
If I have your permission...

67
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,330
I would like Ajay to carry forward
my legacy.

68
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,550
- Come, Ajay.
- Thank you, sir.

69
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,460
Whether I'm here or not...

70
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:56,760
Our pledge to bring change
should remain alive.

71
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,280
I hope you would approve of my decision.

72
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,420
So he's your problem. Ishwar Prasad.

73
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:20,090
Do you expect me to give up my chair
for some poor farmer's son?

74
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,370
Rawat, do something so we can rein him.

75
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,620
In all these years of being in politics

76
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,200
Ishwar Prasad has never made money
illegally.

77
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,500
He's dedicated his entire life
to public service.

78
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,740
Ishwar Prasad is a very honest man, sir.

79
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,640
That's the problem, Rawat.

80
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,330
He's too honest.

81
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,970
And if he quits politics...

82
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,160
He'll be seen as a martyr,
and we'll look like traitors.

83
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,900
And then some party will come along
and make him the Chief Minister.

84
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,100
The case he is using to become
a public hero...

85
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,330
Let's use the same case
to put him behind bars.

86
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,820
I understand your situation.

87
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,340
If children of poor farmers and labourers
start entering politics...

88
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,830
How will your family hold on to power?

89
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,750
Sorry sir, I cannot do this.

90
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:14,330
We didn't give you this CBI post
just like that, Rawat.

91
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,110
Then take it back.

92
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,400
I won't engage in slander
against an honest man.

93
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,920
We have an army of mudslingers
for that, Rawat.

94
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,160
Sir.

95
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,880
Call CBI Joint Director
Satakshi Ganguly here.

96
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,130
Jai Hind, ma'am.
ACP Abhay Singh reporting.

97
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,610
Both of you. Out!

98
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,210
He's been handling the idol theft case.

99
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,410
You mean mishandle.

100
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,610
Idols from 12 temples have been stolen
in 6 months. What's going on?

101
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,450
They're idols for us, ma'am...

102
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,990
But for smugglers,
they're priceless antiques.

103
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,250
There's a huge demand for them globally.

104
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,880
Antique smugglers are behind this.
Simple.

105
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,040
This isn't the handiwork of smugglers
or antique collectors.

106
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,150
There's definitely a powerful
local politician involved.

107
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,790
What's your opinion, ma'am?

108
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,030
Ma'am.

109
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,750
Take a look carefully.

110
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,360
20 km from Karkara village...

111
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,630
Bholenathmath.
The Somnath idol was stolen there.

112
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,050
18 km from Pitampur - Kankarmath.

113
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,210
The Siddha Chamundi idol was stolen.

114
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,300
12 km from Omkareshwar. Prachand Ganpati.

115
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,380
At the time of every temple
theft - without any exception...

116
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,840
Central Water Resources
Minister Ishwar Prasad...

117
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,110
Was nearby either
inaugurating some programme...

118
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,460
Or participating in
some social welfare scheme..

119
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:17,100
Are you suggesting that these idols
have been stolen by Ishwar Prasad?

120
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,410
Ma'am, wherever ministers go,
the entire police force follows.

121
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,910
Maybe the smugglers followed
Ishwar Prasad's programme?

122
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:31,150
Or maybe Ishwar Prasad was following
the smugglers' programme.

123
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,860
Ma'am, I feel we're starting
this investigation on a wrong note.

124
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,370
Ma'am, Ishwar Prasad is
a very honest politician.

125
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,540
Get out.

126
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,880
Out!

127
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,790
I don't like negativity.

128
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,780
Your job is to follow my orders.
Not give me useless opinions.

129
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,920
Yes ma'am.

130
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,020
Ma'am Ishwar Prasad's worship him.

131
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,940
If we mess with him,
the entire state will be on fire.

132
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,540
Every king has a chink in their armor.

133
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,900
He has one too.

134
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:04,330
2011 Civil Services topper,
Chanchal Chauhan.

135
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:09,290
She was his personal secretary
for 2 terms - 10 years.

136
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:14,220
In fact, Ishwar Prasad appointed her
twice as his personal secretary.

137
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:20,740
She'll know about everything
Ishwar Prasad has been upto.

138
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,750
- Get her.
- Chanchal is currently in remand, ma'am.

139
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,500
We can't get her.

140
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,890
You are right.

141
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,890
I know.

142
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:35,190
Chanchal's been jailed since 3 months
for your brother's murder.

143
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,520
And that makes our job even easier.

144
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,060
We can interrogate her
without drawing suspicion.

145
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:48,640
I thought you got me on this case
because of my honesty.

146
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,480
Now I know...

147
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,560
It's actually because of personal reasons.

148
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,120
Sincerity can get you medals, ACP.
Not justice.

149
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,820
If we interrogate Chanchal in jail,

150
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,900
it will become public.

151
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,850
Did I say we'll interrogate her in jail?

152
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,430
Find me an ideal place.

153
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,170
- Now.
- Ma'am.

154
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,110
This is a forest area.

155
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,570
We sometimes go here to stage fake...

156
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,920
I mean, shootouts often take place here.

157
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,420
And that's Panna village.

158
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,360
After the Prandhaara project,
no one lives here anymore.

159
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,210
- This is also a good location.
- What's that?

160
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,470
That's an old mansion, ma'am.
We can't go there.

161
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,610
Why?

162
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,740
There's an idiotic rumour
about this mansion.

163
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,550
The villagers say it's haunted.

164
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,970
No one dares to go anywhere near it.

165
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,250
Perfect.

166
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,750
We'll go where no one else does.

167
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,520
But madam, this is...
- I want three idiots from your team.

168
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,140
Total nitwits.

169
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,360
Ma'am.

170
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,990
Sir.

171
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,340
Please come.

172
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,430
Sir.

173
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,620
- What will you say your name is?
- Chanchal Chauhan, Sir.

174
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,280
Cell number 14.
And your number's 68.

175
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,880
Chanchal!

176
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,390
Chanchal!

177
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,010
- Where are we going?
- To another jail.

178
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,670
Didn't I tell you?
There's construction going on here.

179
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,020
Come.

180
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,130
Come on!

181
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,620
What's going on, officer?

182
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,180
You'll soon find out. Move.

183
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,650
Where are we shifting her, sir?

184
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,030
Durgamati mansion.

185
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,400
What?

186
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,490
What are you staring at?

187
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,990
Sir... Don't go there, sir!

188
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,110
What? Get lost!

189
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,270
Let's go.

190
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,150
Sir, Durgamati mansion?

191
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,970
Sir, it's in ruins, in the jungle...

192
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,890
- Go get the roadmap.
- But sir...

193
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,530
- Go!
- Yes sir!

194
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,990
Why did you get scared hearing
about Durgamati mansion?

195
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,100
Durgamati mansion is no picnic spot...

196
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,900
Where you just go to spend a day.

197
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,350
Whoever goes there... never returns.

198
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,970
Why?

199
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,040
Are there dancing angels there
that people don't want to leave?

200
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,380
She's no dancing angel...

201
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,990
She's an angel of vengeance!

202
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:28,210
That place is no ordinary mansion...

203
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,860
Durgamati Mansion is a haunted house!

204
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,440
Who was Durgamati?

205
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:39,280
She was the queen of the province.

206
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,420
She would imprison anyone
who defied her...

207
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,860
And sacrifice them to the Goddess
on a new moon night.

208
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,550
Durgamati's enemies killed her
mercilessly.

209
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,630
They say the mansion
is haunted by her spirit.

210
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,090
I'll shift her to the mansion
and send you the location.

211
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,370
Get Madam there tomorrow.

212
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,200
Get in.

213
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,460
Sit.

214
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,350
Madam!

215
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,970
Hello Madam.

216
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,740
- Hello Nand Singh! How are you?
- I'm good, madam.

217
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,390
- Started work?
- Yes Madam.

218
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,320
- Good.
- It's all thanks to you.

219
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,510
Not at all.
It was your father's job.

220
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,000
Just work as honestly as he did.

221
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,570
Madam, sweets...

222
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,000
Sir... there won't be any problem, right?

223
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,630
There will be no problem from our side.

224
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,960
- But this must remain strictly between us.
- Yes sir.

225
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,760
- Is that okay?
- Yes sir.

226
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:42,180
- Hey! What's going on over there?
- Sir!

227
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,880
Where are you taking me?

228
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,770
I have a right to know.

229
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,750
Brother, I think Chanchal is betraying me!

230
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,660
Why did you kill my brother? Why?

231
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,060
Why did you kill my brother?

232
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,330
- Sir!
- What the hell!

233
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,880
Today's weather forecast.

234
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,320
Due to the impending cyclone

235
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,670
strong winds and heavy rain
are expected in the next 48 hours.

236
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:46,180
The weather department warns
that trees could fall during the storm.

237
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,440
Staying indoors is advised
unless there's an emergency.

238
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,230
- Nandu!
- Yes sir.

239
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,950
Inspect the place.

240
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,200
Is anyone out there?

241
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,810
Hello?

242
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,570
Is anyone there?

243
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,900
Sir. There's no one here.
Let's go back.

244
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,030
Open the gate!

245
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,380
God save us!

246
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,820
Hey! Who are you?

247
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,260
I'm the watchman.

248
00:21:59,050 --> 00:21:59,980
Open the gate.

249
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,360
I'm handicapped, sir. I can't.

250
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,050
What happened, Nandu?

251
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,320
Why have you got me here?

252
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,000
Don't worry, we won't kill you.

253
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:33,520
You'll stay in this mansion
for a few days.

254
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,610
Think of it as house arrest.

255
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,390
Some officers will come
to interrogate you.

256
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,660
The more you cooperate,
the better it will be for you.

257
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,170
As long as you stay inside,
you'll be safe.

258
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,430
But if you even think of escaping...

259
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,510
Sir! What if Madam actually tries
to escape?

260
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,840
- I'll shoot her.
- Huh?

261
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,200
An ambush.

262
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,180
That's how the CBI will classify it.

263
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,970
Hey! Come here!

264
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:01,910
Yes sir.

265
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,940
Aren't you on duty here?
Where were you?

266
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,640
I stay here all day, sir.

267
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:09,580
- But at night...
- You're scared?

268
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,950
I have young children, sir.

269
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,690
What nonsense! Give me the key.

270
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,560
Sorry. Gopi.

271
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,740
This pocket?

272
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:23,420
They'll all be staying here. Her too.

273
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,720
We need to arrange for their meals...

274
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,530
No problem, sir. My wife will do it..

275
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,170
Alright.

276
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,520
- Gopi.
- Sir.

277
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,710
Madam!

278
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,340
You should refuse to stay here.

279
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,020
Why?

280
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,030
They say this place is haunted.

281
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,810
Madam, people in our village say

282
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,660
there's a ghost inside.

283
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,800
- There's a ghost inside?
- Yes madam.

284
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,860
And there are none outside?

285
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,890
I don't believe in all this.

286
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,210
Forgive me, mother! Forgive me!

287
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:44,280
I don't know who they are!

288
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,480
Please don't punish my children for this!

289
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:49,450
Do you know who she is?

290
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:52,360
She's a demoness!

291
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,590
A hungry demoness!

292
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,180
Her thirst for blood is insatiable!

293
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,720
You'll all die...

294
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,650
She'll devour all of you!

295
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:01,860
Shut up!

296
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,860
Any more of this nonsense
and I'll shoot you.

297
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,520
- Now move from here!
- Sir!

298
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,590
Come on!

299
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:48,980
Don't touch!

300
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,670
Don't touch Maa.

301
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,120
- Who are you?
- I'm Kanchan.

302
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,000
The watchman's wife.

303
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,770
Here are your things.

304
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,830
You can bathe and get dressed.

305
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:02,090
The officers are coming to meet you.

306
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,450
Please carry on.

307
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,440
What was she looking at?

308
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,260
It's you!

309
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,940
- Bathroom?
- There.

310
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,020
Did you get scared?

311
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,070
Me? Of course not!

312
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,310
Our land is our right!
We'll protect it with all our might!

313
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,400
- I didn't throw any stone!
- Why did you do it?

314
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,790
I told you there must be no violence.

315
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,400
Who asked you to throw stones?

316
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,700
Tell me!

317
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:17,870
Tell me!

318
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,310
Our land is our right!
We'll protect it with all our might!

319
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,930
Our land is our right!
We'll protect it with all our might!

320
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,240
Calm down..
Please calm down.

321
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,110
What is all this?

322
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,540
If everything you had was
suddenly snatched from you

323
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:39,810
turning you into a refugee on
your own land, then you'd know.

324
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,500
So you're the one instigating all of them?

325
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,660
I'm telling them the truth.

326
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:47,900
People with honesty and integrity
aren't swayed so easily.

327
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,480
You took away their land,
fields, homes, livelihoods...

328
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,180
Their soil, their very roots
were robbed overnight.

329
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:57,060
Folks from 135 villages who lived
with dignity, honesty and hard work

330
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,490
were left begging for their rights
thanks to your government.

331
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:02,790
If the nation has to progress,
sacrifices must be made.

332
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,170
Please try to understand.

333
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:08,020
And why must the poor always
face the brunt of sacrifice?

334
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,290
Why do the rich never
bear the cost?

335
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,500
Please listen to me.

336
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,620
I will never allow injustice upon you.

337
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,030
Whatever we're doing
is for your own good.

338
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,850
Police! Someone, help!

339
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,550
The contractor's goons who threw stones
have all gotten away.

340
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:41,430
While innocent protesting villagers
have been arrested.

341
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,140
And you still want us to trust you,
Chanchal?

342
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,340
Assistant Commissioner of Police?

343
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,640
My brother.

344
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,680
Chanchal Chauhan, IAS...

345
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,170
Madam, you're here?

346
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:28,520
Dude, you could've at least
called before coming!

347
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,400
Please come in, Madam.
I'll just change and come.

348
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:38,570
What was the need for that loud protest?
You could have just spoken to Madam.

349
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,630
You know what Bhagat Singh said -

350
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,500
"For the deaf to listen...
The sound must be very loud."

351
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,010
Our voice is our only weapon.

352
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,150
If we don't use it,
how will we get our rights?

353
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,820
- Come on kids!
- Voice of the voiceless.

354
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,840
Who would think that he has
an MBA degree from Stanford?

355
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,480
From Stanford?

356
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,160
He gave up his great job, fat salary
and comfortable in America

357
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,500
to come here and work
with people in the village.

358
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,310
- Who wants to learn how to record?
- I want to!

359
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:16,310
He says that in the US,
he could only transform his life...

360
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:21,520
But in India, he can potentially
change thousands of lives.

361
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,450
At first, I was upset with him...

362
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,020
But seeing the village progress
over the last two years

363
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,800
I feel really proud of him.

364
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,740
You need to balance it.

365
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,850
He's very passionate.

366
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:37,490
And a bit aggressive at times.

367
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:53,310
Madam... if we construct the dam, the
surrounding villages have to be vacated.

368
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:59,830
Convincing the villagers to move
would be very difficult.

369
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:05,570
One man can do it. Shakti.

370
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:09,680
If he comes on board,
the villagers will follow suit.

371
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,210
But he's very short-tempered, madam.

372
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:16,140
He's principled.

373
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,860
Getting angry at injustice
isn't a bad thing.

374
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:46,830
If you're really trying to improve
our lives, why would we oppose you?

375
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:51,790
If the dam will really benefit us,
we'll support the project.

376
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,840
But remember...

377
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:00,240
The villagers hold their land
dearer than their lives.

378
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,050
Nothing should go wrong.

Chanchal. Sir.

409
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,680
Sir... Hello!

410
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:23,700
Chanchal, whether you believe it or not...

411
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:26,040
You're like a daughter to me.

412
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,060
Interesting.

413
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,660
This mansion in the heart of this forest
was built to house Gondwa's Army Chief.

414
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,050
Later, it was turned into a
guest-house for British officers.

415
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,800
Now it's under the Forest department.

416
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,730
You won't find anyone here to help
or give information.

417
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:27,160
Come. Let me show you our hub.

418
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,710
Apart from her bedroom and bathroom...

419
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,750
Interrogation room, kitchen, hall...

420
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:39,830
We can keep a watch
on every part of the mansion.

421
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:43,170
Even sunlight can't enter here
without our permission.

422
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:48,190
- Daaruk. Go and get her.
- Yes ma'am.

423
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,970
- Thanks for everything, ACP.
- Pleasure, ma'am.

424
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,700
Your work here is over.

425
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:56,490
With you around,
Chanchal won't tell us anything.

426
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:57,540
But ma'am...

427
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,580
- Jose, shut the gates.
- Yes ma'am.

428
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:24,390
Satakshi Ganguly. CBI.

429
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,150
Please.

430
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:30,570
Here. Sit.

431
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,060
We don't usually offer criminals
a seat during interrogation.

432
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:35,910
Consider it a favour.

433
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,540
Please.

434
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,370
Selvam, everything is clear and recording?

435
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:47,520
Everything is clear and recording, sir.

436
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,250
CBI interrogation?

437
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,430
- What's going on here?
- What do you think?

438
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:56,420
What's going on...

439
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,810
Ms Chanchal Chauhan, IAS?

440
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:03,480
I'm in no state to solve your riddles.

441
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,700
Please ask whatever you want to clearly.

442
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,140
Well then, let the law take
its own course.

443
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,280
You've detained me here illegally...

444
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:17,050
The law is certainly not taking
its own course.

445
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,890
You worked with a corrupt politician
for 10 years...

446
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:22,160
You didn't think of what's
legal and illegal then?

447
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,690
Minister Ishwar Prasad?

448
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,580
Behind his righteous facade...

449
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,690
Is a monster.

450
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:35,060
You're going to tell us
about all his illegal activities.

451
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,350
You are barking up the wrong tree.

452
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,270
What does Ishwar Sir
have to do with my case?

453
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:46,980
You're wasting your time here.

454
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:51,060
You won't find anything
against Ishwar Sir...

455
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,900
From me or anyone else.

456
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:54,730
And anyway

457
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:57,520
you don't have the right
to interrogate me in this case.

458
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,860
One minute. Sit.

459
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:02,220
Sit down?

460
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:11,790
Here's our license to interrogate you.
From the Honorable court.

461
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:16,450
We already have evidence to put
Ishwar Prasad behind bars.

462
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:19,170
Evidence against Ishwar Prasad?

463
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:21,000
What's she talking about?

464
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:23,510
She's bluffing, Sodhi.

465
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,150
It's a fake order.

466
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,110
It's tough to crack a person
who is fully aware of the law.

467
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,010
Madam is illegally playing the legal card.

468
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:37,310
Who would know a minister's secrets
better than his personal secretary?

469
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,370
As a Government servant

470
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:45,620
answering my questions
is your duty, not a choice.

471
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,940
Speak up comrades,
raise your voice!

472
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:52,000
Raise your voice! Raise your voice!

473
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,750
Rise up against the regime!

474
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:55,750
Raise your voice! Raise your voice!

475
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:58,490
- Say it loud...
- We are one!

476
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:00,490
This is the fight for our future.

477
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:05,650
Until the administration agrees
to give scholarships to poor students...

478
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:08,180
Raise your voice!

479
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:11,280
You seem to have made the right decision
appointing Ajay.

480
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:14,630
- Say it loud...
- We are one!

481
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,710
I need to talk to you, Sir.

482
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:22,300
I believe some people
are badmouthing you

483
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:25,820
because of your decision.

484
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:27,700
Ajay...

485
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:33,220
The power of people is always stronger
than the people in power.

486
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:37,530
In a democracy,
the public is our God.

487
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:40,810
No matter how powerful
the ruling party gets,

488
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,840
they can't be above God, right?

489
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,060
God lies within these people.

490
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:49,230
And God is with us.

491
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:52,070
Don't worry. Come on.

492
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:54,230
Raise your voice!

493
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,120
Raise your voice!

494
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:58,460
Raise your voice!

495
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:00,770
Ask away.

496
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,490
You were appointed as Ishwar Prasad's
personal secretary once.

497
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:07,680
Then you took the decision
to be his secretary for another term.

498
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:09,440
Why?

499
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,950
Any special relationship?

500
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:19,690
I never wanted to be
Ishwar Sir's secretary.

501
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:24,070
I was always more interested
in administration.

502
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,890
But after working with Ishwar Sir...

503
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,360
I gained a whole new perspective.

504
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,470
Through the journey he
began as a student leader...

505
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:39,040
He became a shining
example for our society.

506
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:42,710
He's spent all his time amongst people,
working towards their welfare.

507
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,520
When his own brother
was found guilty of corruption

508
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,670
he threw him out of his home and party.

509
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,270
I was truly inspired by his vision
and determination.

510
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,460
So when I got the opportunity
to be his secretary again...

511
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:58,410
I accepted it, proudly.

512
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:00,670
You worked with Ishwar Prasad
for ten years.

513
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:05,180
Never found anything doubtful,
unusual or abnormal?

514
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:07,170
Of course.

515
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:11,070
Sacrificing his family life
to serve the people...

516
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:13,900
Not earning money illegally...

517
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:18,840
Dutifully paying back the loan he took
for his son's education in America...

518
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:22,940
It's all pretty abnormal
for an Indian minister, right?

519
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:26,050
If you're done praising your Lord,
shall we come to the point?

520
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:32,360
In the last election, Ishwar Prasad spent
3 crores over the allotted election fund.

521
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,000
That's a lie. Check again.

522
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:38,910
- So the Election Commission is lying?
- No one is incorruptible.

523
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:42,330
Of course. Except Ishwar Prasad.

524
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:46,270
Anyway. Who are his close friends?

525
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,630
His PA Pramod, Ajay,
and some party supporters.

526
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:51,200
That's about it.

527
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,650
But they're his greatest
strength and asset.

528
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,340
Where does he spend his free time?

529
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:00,280
France, Bangkok, or...

530
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,180
He spends his time with God.

531
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:08,720
He loves visiting ancient temples.

532
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:14,360
Does he go to worship God,
or to fool people?

533
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,990
He goes to be one with God..

534
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,480
Well Ms. Chanchal...

535
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,750
You're done for the day.
You can leave.

536
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:30,210
ACP.

537
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:35,140
Madam doesn't want you
to stay here tonight.

538
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:38,040
These guys will handle the security.

539
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,680
Don't mind, okay?

540
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,480
- Peetal!
- Yes sir.

541
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,270
You're responsible for
Chanchal's security tonight.

542
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,000
And you two...

543
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:51,890
What nonsense!

544
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:57,820
No one enters or leaves this place
without my permission.

545
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:00,390
Both of you will stay here tonight.
Is that clear?

546
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:03,090
Stop acting, pick her up
and put her in the car!

547
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:04,520
Sir... me?

548
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,330
Cheater!

549
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,650
Gopi... She's a cheater!

550
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:23,400
Even a ghost would get goosebumps
in this mansion...

551
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,130
And they've kept a woman all alone here!

552
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:31,020
Gopi, tell me something...

553
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:33,500
Do ghosts really exist?

554
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:34,700
Of course!

555
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:38,600
I married one,
and so did my father-in-law!

556
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:41,430
There's no scarier ghost
than those two!

557
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:46,880
- Nandu!
- Madam!

558
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:48,920
What happened to the electricity?

559
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,820
All the electric poles fell
during the storm!

560
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:57,090
- Generator?
- It's run out of diesel, madam!

561
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:01,260
Even the cameras aren't working.
Please go inside!

562
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:14,100
Who is it?

563
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:16,690
Who's there?

564
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:23,840
Boo!

565
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:26,610
A ghost?

566
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:29,220
Rubbish.

567
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:06,510
Who's there?

568
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:12,640
Who's over there?

569
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:21,330
Who is it?

570
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,570
Who... Who's there?

571
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:26,280
I don't know anything!

572
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,010
I don't know anything!

573
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,260
- Please stop!
- Shut up! Wimp.

574
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,600
Listen to me. I wasn't scared.

575
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:52,210
I went closer...

576
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:53,870
Slowly... Slowly...

577
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:57,940
I saw that her feet
pointed backwards...

578
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:00,560
Yes!

579
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:03,710
And her head was spinning.

580
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:09,100
And then slowly...

581
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:11,790
I felt two hands creep up
on my shoulders...

582
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:17,230
- Did you just touch my shoulder?
- No!

583
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,160
I thought you touched mine!

584
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:26,260
I have no hands, sir.

585
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:30,880
He's got hands!
He's got hands!

586
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:31,750
Go check him!

587
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:39,680
- What?
- A little lower!

588
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:43,480
His hands aren't down there, idiot!

589
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:53,720
Now why are you shivering
like a leaf, Gopi?

590
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,960
Nandu!

591
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,460
Look...

592
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,400
There's no one there!

593
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:09,060
- But he has hands!
- Who?

594
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:27,060
Nandu!

595
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:30,220
Gopi!

596
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:33,900
Nandu!

597
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:36,980
Madam!

598
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:39,610
What happened Madam?

599
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:43,120
There's someone inside!
There's something in there!

600
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,130
- Please open the gate!
- What happened?

601
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:47,140
Please! Please!

602
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:54,730
Nandu, the ghost I saw out there...

603
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:56,830
I think Madam saw
the same ghost inside!

604
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,400
Open the lock!

605
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:01,580
Are you nuts?
We'll lose our jobs!

606
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:05,790
At least call the ACP!

607
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:09,990
Madam! Don't worry, madam!
Everything will be fine!

608
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:13,300
- Hello.
- This is Nandu, Sir!

609
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:15,100
- I'm at Durgamati mansion.
- Yeah, tell me.

610
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,000
There's...
There's something here, Sir!

611
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,850
What are you blabbering away?

612
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:22,060
- Tell him there's a ghost here!
- There's a ghost, sir!

613
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:23,730
Bloody idiots!

614
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:25,740
If you're high on country liquor,
you're bound to see ghosts!

615
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:28,380
Believe me, Sir!
The ghost attacked Madam!

616
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:32,120
This 'Chanchal Madam' of yours
was caught red-handed committing murder!

617
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,110
She'll escape from right under
your noses, you idiots!

618
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:37,670
No sir, this mansion really is haunted!

619
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,670
Tell her to shut up and go to sleep.

620
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:41,930
Now hang up!

621
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:44,520
Madam, he's speaking to the ACP.
Nandu! At least open the lock now!

622
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:47,420
Nandu!

623
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:50,270
Sorry, madam.

624
01:00:10,290 --> 01:00:12,450
Madam!

625
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,510
Madam! Why are you sleeping here?

626
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,990
Madam... How did you get hurt?

627
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,190
Get up.

628
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,340
What kind of policemen are you?
You left her here like this?

629
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:27,630
Come with me, madam.

630
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:30,190
Madam, everyone knows it...

631
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,880
That witch spares no one.

632
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:37,030
And they still brought you here!

633
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,260
Madam, you should tell
the officials what happened!

634
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,990
They won't listen.

635
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,970
May I say something?

636
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:53,480
You don't look like
you could murder someone.

637
01:00:58,270 --> 01:00:59,690
I'm sorry, madam.

638
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:01,960
I'll get you some tea.

639
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:43,940
What's that?

640
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,980
I slipped and fell in the dark.

641
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:50,250
This isn't some ploy
to gain sympathy, right?

642
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:51,400
Hey!

643
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:57,250
Your boss...

644
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:00,030
- Minister Ishwar Prasad...
- The Governor is my boss.

645
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:05,300
So you think Ishwar Prasad
can do no wrong?

646
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:10,240
You've already decided what the truth is.
This investigation is an afterthought.

647
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:14,470
Everything I am telling you is true.

648
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:20,900
I want to hear it loud and clear.
Ishwar Prasad is a thief.

649
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:24,120
Yesterday you called him corrupt,
now he's a thief.

650
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,140
What will he be next?
A terrorist?

651
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:29,280
Stick to what you're asked.

652
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:30,960
Let me come to the point.

653
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:34,170
12 priceless idols were stolen
in the last 6 months.

654
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:35,640
You know from where?

655
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:39,440
The same ancient temples
that Ishwar Prasad loves to visit.

656
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:44,420
Temples that Ishwar Prasad
and thousands of devotees visit.

657
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:48,430
Anyone could have stolen the idols. No?

658
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:53,000
Your god stole the idols.
He sold God to satisfy his greed!

659
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:58,110
He's never chased money
in his political career of 30 years...

660
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:00,750
Why would he do it now?

661
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:05,900
And even if he wanted money -
why would he bother stealing idols...

662
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:09,170
When he could easily
earn billions with one signature?

663
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:13,670
It's not like he plans to hoard money
in 6 months and escape the country.

664
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:16,070
Think big.

665
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:19,470
I don't want to think anything.

666
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:21,380
I have evidence.

667
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,880
If you have evidence,
why waste your time with me?

668
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:28,030
Go, arrest him.

669
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:33,230
Sir it's only been two days.
We're dealing with an IAS officer.

670
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:34,990
She's not a regular criminal.

671
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,580
She's very smart.

672
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:38,500
It'll take some time to crack her.

673
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:39,900
How much?

674
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:44,940
Sir, evidence against Ishwar Prasad
lies hidden in Chanchal's answers.

675
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:46,270
Unravelling it will take time.

676
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:48,710
Do you have another plan?

677
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:50,750
I'll try offering her a deal.

678
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:51,610
Okay.

679
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:55,420
Fine. Let's say Ishwar Prasad
is a good and honest man.

680
01:03:56,090 --> 01:03:58,680
Then why isn't he helping
you get out of jail?

681
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:02,800
Why would a law-abiding citizen
interfere with the legal process?

682
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:04,780
Then let me help you.

683
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:09,910
I can get you both your job
and your freedom back.

684
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,240
If I help you frame Ishwar Prasad?

685
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:13,990
You are smart.

686
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:18,050
I'd rather say the truth and stay here
than lie to get free.

687
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:23,260
You're not asking me to betray
Ishwar Prasad, but my country.

688
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:25,050
- I am sorry.
- Hey!

689
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:27,390
I don't like negativity!

690
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:29,250
Madam !

691
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:32,210
She's lying. I know she's lying.

692
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,360
Someone help me prove that she's lying!

693
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:41,400
When a normal person lies,
they can't move their limbs freely

694
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:44,460
because they're fully focused
on what they're saying.

695
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:49,130
When someone lies to you,
they can't look you in the eye.

696
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:50,570
Confidently!

697
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,720
She spoke confidently,
looking straight into my eyes.

698
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:55,400
Next!

699
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:59,190
She never lost her cool
during the interrogation.

700
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:04,620
She didn't scratch her nose,
ears or hands either.

701
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:05,770
Enough!

702
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:08,080
Just tell me if she's lying or not.

703
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:11,890
Unless Chanchal has been trained to lie
by militants,

704
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:14,280
she's saying the truth.

705
01:05:18,020 --> 01:05:20,680
Mr Minister, why are you standing in line?

706
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:25,290
Look, there's only one VIP here...
And that's God.

707
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,230
Everyone else is equal.

708
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:29,590
But sir, how can you...

709
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:35,640
This is one place left where
there's no discrimination.

710
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:36,670
Why ruin it?

711
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:39,230
- Thank you.
- Hello sir.

712
01:06:31,550 --> 01:06:32,640
Hello.

713
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:35,300
Okay.

714
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:38,760
Move! Move!

715
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:43,380
- Long live Ishwar Prasad!
- I'll talk to you later.

716
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:44,980
Long live Ishwar Prasad!

717
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:46,610
Was it an important call?

718
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:49,680
My friend called, sir.
His mother is unwell.

719
01:06:50,050 --> 01:06:52,050
I've told you so many times,
I hate all this pomp-and-show.

720
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:54,010
What can I do, sir.
They say it's their duty.

721
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:55,810
Long live Ishwar Prasad!

722
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:49,090
The power's back now...
Why is Madam screaming?

723
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:50,530
Call the ACP, quick!

724
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:56,960
- Yes, Nandu!
- Sir, Madam's screaming again!

725
01:09:57,450 --> 01:09:59,550
The electricity is back too.
I wonder what's scaring her!

726
01:09:59,670 --> 01:10:00,850
- The electricity's back?
- Yes.

727
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:02,380
Go to the hub, quick!

728
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:05,060
- Are you there?
- Yes, Sir.

729
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,940
If the power's back,
you should be able to see all the rooms.

730
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:08,920
Let me check, sir!

731
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,270
- Interrogation room?
- She's not there, sir!

732
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:11,550
- Hall?
- No, sir!

733
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,970
- The hall upstairs?
- Madam isn't in any of the rooms, sir!

734
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:18,530
- Do you have a gun?
- Yes, sir!

735
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,290
Listen to me carefully.

736
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,160
Her room's the only one
with no cameras installed.

737
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:25,710
- Go inside.
- Sir!

738
01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:30,860
I was sure there are more
people involved in this case.

739
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,650
If you see anyone unusual,
Just shoot.

740
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:34,020
Sir.

741
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:38,040
If Chanchal tries to escape,
shoot her too.

742
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,840
- Sir.
- Just shoot her!

743
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:44,580
Sir!

744
01:10:54,870 --> 01:10:56,140
Madam!

745
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:58,610
Madam!

746
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:01,910
- Where are you, madam?
- Madam!

747
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:06,690
Where are you, madam?

748
01:11:07,050 --> 01:11:08,350
Madam!

749
01:11:12,690 --> 01:11:13,580
Gopi...

750
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:23,470
The screaming has stopped.
Let's go!

751
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:25,700
Shut up!

752
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,480
- What's that?
- Where are you, madam?

753
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:34,420
Anklet bells?

754
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:36,360
What's this?

755
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:39,650
Madam?

756
01:11:51,770 --> 01:11:53,380
What happened?

757
01:12:07,810 --> 01:12:10,070
Madam? Madam?

758
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:11,930
What's this?

759
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,320
- Welcome to Go Goa.
- Gopi, let's go from here.

760
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,620
Please come, Your Highness
Queen Durgamati.

761
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:24,210
The public awaits your presence.

762
01:12:24,430 --> 01:12:27,340
Queen Durgamati is arriving!

763
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:32,860
Madam!

764
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:35,900
Madam!

765
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:46,410
Gopi, get up! Let's go!

766
01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:50,270
Madam!

767
01:12:53,030 --> 01:12:54,520
Madam!

768
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,150
Madam!

769
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:03,540
Gopi, you leave!

770
01:13:06,610 --> 01:13:08,750
Come with me!

771
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:16,930
Madam!

772
01:13:38,090 --> 01:13:39,610
Should we go in?

773
01:13:39,730 --> 01:13:42,440
Are you nuts?
We'll die if we go inside.

774
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:44,410
If we don't, the ACP will kill us.

775
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:48,470
Madam!

776
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,030
Madam!

777
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:59,520
Gopi, look...

778
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:02,340
Why is Madam's torch lying here?

779
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:04,880
Madam!

780
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:10,610
Gopi, the chair's moving on its own!

781
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:13,380
This place is spooked. Let's go!

782
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:14,830
Where will you go?

783
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:43,920
Who wants to go from here?

784
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:46,690
And who will take her?

785
01:14:47,170 --> 01:14:49,060
You?

786
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:55,490
Gopi please...

787
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,250
Help me...

788
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:00,460
You're going to take her?

789
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:02,960
Try if you dare!

790
01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:09,750
No one's leaving this place!

791
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:13,250
No one!

792
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:21,220
You think you can come
and go as you please?

793
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:23,830
You pathetic men have no
say over here!

794
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:31,550
This is Durgamati's palace!

795
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:37,060
Spare me, mother!

796
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:01,490
Who are you, mother?

797
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:03,820
Who am I?

798
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:14,580
The call of death!

799
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:27,080
Fierce as a tigress!

800
01:16:34,530 --> 01:16:37,000
I'm Durgamati!

801
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:43,540
An angry ball of fire,
the slayer of evil...

802
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:45,680
I'm the Goddess of fury,
the doom of sin!

803
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:04,420
I'll settle every score...
I'll make everyone pay!

804
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:07,590
Until then, neither will I leave...

805
01:17:08,810 --> 01:17:10,780
Nor will I let anyone else leave!

806
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:34,000
Why was there no
female security with her?

807
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:35,790
Don't you know the rules?

808
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:37,240
Rules?

809
01:17:38,690 --> 01:17:41,780
Have we followed any rules
so far?

810
01:17:43,610 --> 01:17:45,930
Anyway, Peetal will accompany her
today onwards.

811
01:17:46,050 --> 01:17:48,080
- How is Nand Singh now?
- He's in hospital, ma'am.

812
01:17:48,490 --> 01:17:50,360
His condition is very critical.

813
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,250
Anything could happen.

814
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:54,330
And Gopi?

815
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:58,330
He's been petrified since last night.

816
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:01,340
Call him.

817
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:06,220
Who's this Durgamati?

818
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:09,480
I think she was the owner of this mansion.

819
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:14,020
But all this is just a ploy to escape.

820
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:15,790
Really?

821
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:20,200
She could have easily escaped last night.
Why didn't she?

822
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:29,260
Find out who Durgamati is
and how she's connected to Chanchal.

823
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:36,650
Should I wake her up?

824
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:39,190
No. Call a doctor.

825
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,770
Actually, call a psychiatrist.

826
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:48,470
- Madam.
- Why did you go inside?

827
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:50,440
Ma'am the ACP asked us to go inside.

828
01:18:50,990 --> 01:18:54,840
Ma'am, I nearly died last night...

829
01:18:55,050 --> 01:18:59,030
Please relieve me from this duty, ma'am.
I want to get out of here, please!

830
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:03,770
If you're such a wimp,
become the doorman at a temple!

831
01:19:03,890 --> 01:19:05,600
Why join the police?

832
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:11,000
No one enters or leaves
this place till our work is done.

833
01:19:14,730 --> 01:19:16,120
Look at this, sir.

834
01:19:17,730 --> 01:19:20,620
Yeah. Looks promising.
Let's discuss this next time.

835
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,410
Okay sir. Thank you, sir.

836
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:26,040
We'll make sure this proposal
is beneficial to the government.

837
01:19:28,570 --> 01:19:30,280
Do you see those people?

838
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:33,670
Long Live Ishwar Prasad!

839
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:38,810
Think of what will benefit them,
not the government.

840
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:43,960
- Hello Mr Ishwar Prasad!
- Hello!

841
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,590
All good with you?

842
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:48,490
Great.

843
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:56,350
Long Live Ishwar Prasad!

844
01:19:56,470 --> 01:19:58,340
Long Live Ishwar Prasad!

845
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,600
Long Live Ishwar Prasad!

846
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:02,340
Come, sir.

847
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,760
You're still in touch with people

848
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:12,060
who I threw out of the party
for illegal activities?

849
01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:15,040
This isn't good for
your political career, Ajay.

850
01:20:16,130 --> 01:20:19,360
Sir, he's your brother, after all.
He deeply regrets his actions.

851
01:20:20,930 --> 01:20:25,880
Once someone gets corrupted
by greed, they rarely change.

852
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:29,740
I don't give such people
second chances.

853
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:32,300
- Keep away from him.
- Yes sir.

854
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:48,310
You look weak.

855
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:51,470
What's your name?

856
01:20:54,110 --> 01:20:55,340
Chanchal Chauhan.

857
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,250
The policemen mentioned something
about Durgamati...

858
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:06,960
They said you were shouting last night...

859
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:11,300
That you violently attacked them.
Remember anything?

860
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:16,820
And how did you get these injuries?

861
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:19,940
Someone was hitting me...

862
01:21:21,850 --> 01:21:23,800
Who? The police?

863
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:26,910
I don't know, sir.

864
01:21:29,570 --> 01:21:31,340
I couldn't see, but...

865
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:34,750
I was being hit relentlessly.

866
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:42,210
I don't know what's going on over here.

867
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:48,630
Please take me away
from here, sir. Please!

868
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,270
Do you believe in ghosts?

869
01:21:56,940 --> 01:21:59,080
Know any woman called Durgamati?

870
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:05,610
Think carefully. Is there a friend
or relative...

871
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:10,000
Or perhaps a character
from a story, named Durgamati?

872
01:22:10,910 --> 01:22:13,590
- No sir.
- Is it someone in this mansion?

873
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,260
You have no idea, right?

874
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:19,280
I'll tell you who Durgamati was.

875
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:24,140
Durgamati was a college student.

876
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:31,110
Once, her boyfriend took her
to a deserted mansion

877
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:33,570
under the pretext of a holiday.

878
01:22:35,850 --> 01:22:37,850
But he wasn't alone with her.

879
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:44,160
He brought along a bunch
of friends and alcohol.

880
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:48,640
Once they reached the mansion,
they started drinking...

881
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:51,910
And soon, their monstrous
intentions surfaced.

882
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:55,110
Durgamati was alone and cornered

883
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:59,590
Those evil men took advantage
of her and relentlessly...

884
01:23:00,830 --> 01:23:03,410
How tragic and ruthless, isn't it?

885
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:08,790
Durgamati kept screaming...
She begged those men to stop...

886
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,460
But they didn't.

887
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:12,650
They finally stopped after
a few hours

888
01:23:12,770 --> 01:23:16,430
and left Durgamati bleeding
and alone in this very mansion.

889
01:23:16,970 --> 01:23:18,490
She couldn't survive
this trauma.

890
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:22,560
She couldn't bear to be
humiliated in society.

891
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:28,500
Overwhelmed by anger and shame,
she hung herself and died!

892
01:23:28,690 --> 01:23:32,580
No, No... No!

893
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:39,390
That's the truth!

894
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,510
No, no... No!

895
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:43,950
Oh God.

896
01:23:44,070 --> 01:23:46,200
Ma'am, stop, stop!
He's trying to say something!

897
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:54,870
People say that Durgamati
turned into a ghost.

898
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:57,140
No, no.

899
01:23:57,540 --> 01:24:02,110
You must've heard this story
and believed it to be true.

900
01:24:02,490 --> 01:24:04,960
No, no, no, no way!

901
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:07,600
No!

902
01:24:08,930 --> 01:24:12,130
Durgamati isn't a myth,
she's real!

903
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:17,010
Durgamati is an indelible
part of history!

904
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,570
And who is this great
Durgamati you speak of?

905
01:24:24,430 --> 01:24:29,380
Durgamati is the Queen
of this palace!

906
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:41,220
The glorious queen who ruled
Mahati on her fingertips!

907
01:24:58,370 --> 01:25:05,550
To protect the heirless King
Gopal Nandvardhan Bhattarika's kingdom

908
01:25:05,670 --> 01:25:08,770
I picked up the sword...

909
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:13,860
And emerged victorious
against all enemies!

910
01:25:14,270 --> 01:25:18,130
I'm that force of nature,
the raging Goddess Durgamati!

911
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:23,560
When the haughty Sultan who
assumed I was weak and helpless

912
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:26,410
tried to capture my kingdom...

913
01:25:26,530 --> 01:25:29,050
I crushed his army and arrogance
with a resounding victory!

914
01:25:29,170 --> 01:25:34,120
I'm the fearless, brave
warrior Durgamati!

915
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:36,470
So you're Durgamati?

916
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:38,380
Yes!

917
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:45,670
Kakorrhaphiophobia.

918
01:25:46,150 --> 01:25:48,200
Fear of failure or defeat.

919
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:50,830
The fear of losing.

920
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:55,640
You've unconsciously slipped
into a world of fantasy, Chanchal.

921
01:25:56,350 --> 01:25:57,890
Durgamati!

922
01:25:59,150 --> 01:26:00,820
I don't believe you.

923
01:26:01,830 --> 01:26:05,020
In fact, no one will
believe your bizarre story.

924
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:07,430
You won't believe me?

925
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:08,850
You won't believe me?

926
01:26:08,970 --> 01:26:10,940
Then get ready to die!

927
01:26:31,690 --> 01:26:33,970
Fine, I believe
that you're Durgamati.

928
01:26:34,650 --> 01:26:36,130
But tell me this...

929
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:41,600
This palace from where you
bravely guarded your kingdom...

930
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:46,440
Why is it called a haunted house now?

931
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:53,160
The queen who risked her life
to protect her people...

932
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:59,000
Why is Durgamati, the fierce warrior
known as a witch now?

933
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:00,970
Baaz...

934
01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:04,730
The palace that was
regarded as a temple...

935
01:27:04,850 --> 01:27:06,940
How did it become a
symbol of death?

936
01:27:07,150 --> 01:27:09,210
And the queen who was
revered as a goddess

937
01:27:09,330 --> 01:27:13,380
Why is she now called a
ghoul, witch and demoness?

938
01:27:13,810 --> 01:27:18,330
Baaz, Baaz, Baaz...
The traitor!

939
01:27:20,530 --> 01:27:22,090
Who's that?

940
01:27:24,810 --> 01:27:29,620
Baaz Shahbaaz...
The snake who destroyed my life!

941
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:32,320
My Army Chief...

942
01:27:33,570 --> 01:27:37,000
Baaz Shahbaaz was a scoundrel!

943
01:27:40,490 --> 01:27:46,200
Disguising his evil intentions,
He pretended to be a humble servant...

944
01:27:46,940 --> 01:27:53,140
I believed all his lies
and gave him respect and power

945
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:58,910
My people gave him their love
and support...

946
01:27:59,030 --> 01:28:01,370
I made him our Army chief!

947
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:06,850
That's when he started
showing his true colours.

948
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:10,200
He ganged with our enemies
and looted everything!

949
01:28:10,650 --> 01:28:12,510
Our wealth, our land!

950
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:17,110
O Almighty, he didn't even spare you!

951
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:20,360
When I confronted him,

952
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:26,810
he dissolved my powers
and took my army captive!

953
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:30,260
He branded me as crazy
and locked me in this room.

954
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:36,070
Seeing my people suffer
atrocities and injustice...

955
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:39,990
I started to feel ashamed
of my utter helplessness.

956
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:44,310
Overwhelmed by anger and despair...

957
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:50,020
Right here in this room...

958
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:53,380
I hung myself to death.

959
01:28:56,970 --> 01:29:00,240
But I've returned from the dead.

960
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:05,210
I've come back to destroy him!

961
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:08,960
This is your problem, Chanchal.

962
01:29:09,670 --> 01:29:13,220
Even if Baaz Shahbaaz existed,
He must be dead by now.

963
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:16,610
How can you kill someone
who's already dead?

964
01:29:16,940 --> 01:29:18,220
No!

965
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:20,620
He's alive.

966
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:25,060
That rascal is alive and right here!

967
01:29:26,090 --> 01:29:28,370
Until I kill him...

968
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,150
Neither will I go...

969
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:33,230
Now will I let anyone leave!

970
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:40,390
Look, in all probability...
Chanchal is a schizophrenic.

971
01:29:41,310 --> 01:29:43,080
Is that an English Ghost?

972
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:45,620
A mental patient.

973
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:48,190
Forget about me...

974
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:50,990
How does Madam change her voice?

975
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:54,840
Talking in a different voice...

976
01:29:56,140 --> 01:30:00,630
Believing in ancient legends
and becoming a part of them...

977
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:02,750
Getting obsessed with such stories...

978
01:30:02,870 --> 01:30:05,710
They're all symptoms of schizophrenia.

979
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:10,010
Hallucinations and violent behavior...

980
01:30:10,130 --> 01:30:11,620
All this is very common.

981
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:14,710
Tell me something...

982
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:17,310
Is she going through
some kind of trauma?

983
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:20,320
I mean some kind of personal loss...

984
01:30:20,730 --> 01:30:22,320
Like the death of someone close...

985
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:26,080
Stress from work, or some kind of shock?

986
01:30:28,050 --> 01:30:29,760
As far as I know...

987
01:30:30,140 --> 01:30:32,510
Chanchal has never behaved
this way before.

988
01:30:34,580 --> 01:30:37,900
In such a fragile state,
the tiniest things can evoke terror.

989
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:43,380
And in the midst of this wilderness,
even a healthy person can get psyched out.

990
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:47,070
Plus this isolation
and negative vibrations...

991
01:30:48,050 --> 01:30:51,850
All this can trigger off trauma
and unusual behaviour.

992
01:30:53,150 --> 01:30:55,220
Please take my advice...

993
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:58,710
And move her to some normal place.

994
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:01,600
Trust me...

995
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:05,550
This place is no good for schizophrenics.

996
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:08,530
And by the way...

997
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:12,000
She needs medicine for her wounds.

998
01:31:12,190 --> 01:31:13,860
- You too, doctor.
- Peetal!

999
01:31:17,090 --> 01:31:21,510
"Glory to you, Lord Hanuman!
You light up the cosmos..."

1000
01:31:24,070 --> 01:31:26,120
"All ghosts, demons and evil forces
go away,

1001
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:28,250
"At the mention of your name,
Brave One!"

1002
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:33,300
You're not scared of being around Madam?

1003
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:36,360
You're so brave,
PSI Peetal Devi!

1004
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:37,830
A real braveheart.

1005
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:40,580
My Guru gave me a special talisman
this time.

1006
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:41,970
It's very powerful.

1007
01:31:46,850 --> 01:31:48,190
Durgamati?

1008
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:52,870
Chanchal Madam?

1009
01:31:55,710 --> 01:31:58,020
Oh, so it's you!

1010
01:31:58,340 --> 01:32:01,300
I mean, you aren't possessed
by that witch right now.

1011
01:32:06,710 --> 01:32:07,880
Madam!

1012
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:11,980
That's not what I meant...

1013
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:16,030
I wasn't referring to you...
I was talking about that bitch, madam!

1014
01:32:28,730 --> 01:32:29,970
Aunty Durgamati?

1015
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:32,660
Sister Durgamati!

1016
01:32:32,930 --> 01:32:36,490
I didn't mean to disturb you!

1017
01:32:37,050 --> 01:32:42,250
That jackass Gopi...
He insisted we come here.

1018
01:32:42,990 --> 01:32:44,550
Sorry!

1019
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:46,240
Namaste.

1020
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:48,220
What happened to the brave Peetal Devi?

1021
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:50,310
Did you vanquish the ghost?

1022
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:55,010
Though you seem to be breaking
into a cold sweat.

1023
01:32:55,250 --> 01:32:57,580
I always sweat when I need
to use the loo, Gopi!

1024
01:32:57,700 --> 01:32:59,120
Really? What's this?

1025
01:32:59,790 --> 01:33:01,320
I'm leaving.

1026
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:02,630
Gopi!

1027
01:33:06,810 --> 01:33:07,890
Gopi!

1028
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:10,410
What's wrong?

1029
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:11,870
It's just a chair.

1030
01:33:16,570 --> 01:33:17,600
Okay fine.

1031
01:33:18,210 --> 01:33:22,490
You sit and relax.
Make yourself comfortable.

1032
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:24,430
I'll go.

1033
01:33:24,660 --> 01:33:26,330
Where will you go?

1034
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:29,780
Gopi...

1035
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:32,270
Where will you go!

1036
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:35,660
- Gopi... why are you scaring me!
- Tell me!

1037
01:33:36,850 --> 01:33:38,620
Will you go now?

1038
01:33:38,820 --> 01:33:41,430
Gopi... Sister Durgamati!

1039
01:33:46,250 --> 01:33:47,360
Will you still leave?

1040
01:33:48,090 --> 01:33:49,470
I have to, sister!

1041
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:52,120
No, no, no one...

1042
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:55,940
No one will leave from here!

1043
01:34:01,170 --> 01:34:04,070
Okay, I won't go anywhere!

1044
01:34:04,190 --> 01:34:06,140
Please forgive me!

1045
01:34:10,490 --> 01:34:11,380
Gopi!

1046
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:12,630
Asshole!

1047
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:14,980
You got so scared listening to me...

1048
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:18,770
If you see the real Durgamati,
you'll drop dead!

1049
01:34:26,690 --> 01:34:28,950
I still think Chanchal is putting up
an act.

1050
01:34:29,350 --> 01:34:30,520
Found anything, Jose?

1051
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:35,960
Ma'am here are Ishwar Prasad's
income tax papers...

1052
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:41,090
And here is his biodata.

1053
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:44,450
Did you find out what language
she was speaking in?

1054
01:34:45,070 --> 01:34:47,030
Yes ma'am. It's Arabic.

1055
01:34:47,590 --> 01:34:49,030
Arabic?

1056
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:51,710
Father's name, Vrindavan Chauhan.

1057
01:34:51,830 --> 01:34:53,290
Mother's name, Madhavi Kumari.

1058
01:34:53,410 --> 01:34:56,990
Languages spoken...
Hindi, Marwadi, English.

1059
01:34:57,330 --> 01:34:58,910
Arabic isn't even mentioned.

1060
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:02,830
How is this possible?

1061
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:08,590
Can schizophrenics really speak languages
they've never learnt?

1062
01:35:08,780 --> 01:35:11,010
Ma'am, I spoke to the villagers.

1063
01:35:14,790 --> 01:35:18,170
Chanchal doesn't speak Arabic,
but Durgamati did.

1064
01:35:24,570 --> 01:35:25,580
Astonishing.

1065
01:35:26,030 --> 01:35:28,620
I think we should keep an open mind.

1066
01:35:28,910 --> 01:35:29,710
Meaning?

1067
01:35:29,830 --> 01:35:32,420
I mean some things are beyond
the realm of science.

1068
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:34,580
And these things
that are beyond science...

1069
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:35,960
Who will explain them to us?

1070
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:37,570
A witch-doctor.

1071
01:35:37,860 --> 01:35:40,020
Madam, we need to get a witch-doctor.

1072
01:35:41,610 --> 01:35:42,830
Rubbish!

1073
01:35:44,070 --> 01:35:48,320
Ghosts, spirits, witch-doctors...
All this is crap.

1074
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:50,820
But ma'am, we don't have
any explanation for this..

1075
01:35:50,940 --> 01:35:54,520
When Chanchal turns into Durgamati,
how does she start speaking Arabic?

1076
01:35:54,710 --> 01:35:55,800
Correct!

1077
01:35:55,990 --> 01:36:00,650
Ma'am, we shouldn't ignore
any possibilities.

1078
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:20,860
A bad omen!

1079
01:36:23,130 --> 01:36:25,080
- Please, ACP...
- This is nuts.

1080
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:27,000
- Daaruk!
- Yes, Maharaj.

1081
01:36:27,550 --> 01:36:29,210
This house is inhabited by an evil spirit!

1082
01:36:29,330 --> 01:36:30,380
Evil spirit?

1083
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:34,140
I cannot drive it out,
but I can tell you about it...

1084
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:55,620
Is there another way into this mansion?

1085
01:36:55,740 --> 01:36:56,930
- No.
- There is!

1086
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:58,630
See! There is another way.

1087
01:37:58,820 --> 01:38:01,610
If Chanchal knows this way out...
Why didn't she run away?

1088
01:38:01,730 --> 01:38:03,650
No one can leave from here.

1089
01:38:03,860 --> 01:38:04,650
Abhyankar!

1090
01:38:24,180 --> 01:38:25,220
Abhyankar!

1091
01:38:25,460 --> 01:38:26,630
Yes, Maharaj.

1092
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:31,010
Remove that!

1093
01:38:43,490 --> 01:38:46,020
They put this creature in a bottle
and buried it alive...

1094
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:49,640
This snake spirit won't let anyone
leave this place.

1095
01:38:49,950 --> 01:38:53,180
I know educated people like you
will demand proof.

1096
01:38:54,010 --> 01:38:55,310
Take this.

1097
01:38:55,870 --> 01:38:59,930
This is a Faceless Rudraksha Seed.
It has divine properties.

1098
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:04,370
If this seed is surrounded
by positive energy

1099
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:06,190
It will turn red.

1100
01:39:06,630 --> 01:39:10,760
And if it comes in contact
with negative energy

1101
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:12,660
It will turn black.

1102
01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:14,830
Check it after two days.

1103
01:39:14,950 --> 01:39:19,760
If its colour changes, it means that
the aura of this place has turned toxic.

1104
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:22,940
This sandalwood is from
The Ujjaini Mahakali temple.

1105
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:26,570
In the absence of any evil presence

1106
01:39:26,830 --> 01:39:29,350
It will remain fragrant.

1107
01:39:29,950 --> 01:39:31,750
Keep it in the girl's room.

1108
01:39:31,950 --> 01:39:34,120
If it starts reeking,

1109
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:39,920
It means she's possessed
by another spirit.

1110
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:25,550
What is this?

1111
01:40:28,340 --> 01:40:32,170
A photo from the day of the
Prandhaara project inauguration.

1112
01:40:32,470 --> 01:40:34,370
What is this Prandhaara project?

1113
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:39,780
It will turn 600,000 acres
of barren land fertile

1114
01:40:40,610 --> 01:40:44,800
And provide electricity to over
1200 villages.

1115
01:40:44,990 --> 01:40:46,560
Power project.

1116
01:40:49,060 --> 01:40:51,990
This public welfare project
was sanctioned 6 years ago.

1117
01:40:52,230 --> 01:40:54,660
How did the 6 month old Ahluwalia group
bag it?

1118
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:57,390
Did Ishwar Prasad have
any special interest in it?

1119
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:02,430
The Ahluwalia group gave the best quote.

1120
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:06,940
Whoever quotes the lowest
gets the project.

1121
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:11,870
Ishwar Sir only signed the deal.

1122
01:41:12,310 --> 01:41:14,480
The IAS committee makes these decisions.

1123
01:41:14,810 --> 01:41:17,290
I was the chief of the committee.

1124
01:41:17,690 --> 01:41:21,730
Wasn't Ishwar Prasad's younger brother
Surya Prasad managing the project?

1125
01:41:22,090 --> 01:41:22,940
He was.

1126
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:29,420
But when Surya Prasad demanded
a commission from the Ahluwalia group

1127
01:41:29,590 --> 01:41:33,990
Ishwar Sir threw him out of the party,
project and his home.

1128
01:41:34,530 --> 01:41:38,630
You won't find anything wrong
in or around Ishwar Sir.

1129
01:41:38,810 --> 01:41:44,410
Impossible! Politics is a cesspool.
Only scum thrives in it, not honest people.

1130
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:48,590
You're so convinced of your story

1131
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:52,610
that you're refusing to listen
or understand.

1132
01:41:54,570 --> 01:41:58,530
You think I am Ishwar Sir's stooge...

1133
01:42:00,970 --> 01:42:04,870
But I am Chanchal Chauhan IAS!

1134
01:42:05,190 --> 01:42:06,330
Not any more.

1135
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:10,420
I'm going to close your chapter
along with Ishwar Prasad. Get out!

1136
01:42:14,950 --> 01:42:16,730
You met Shakti during this project, right?

1137
01:42:21,820 --> 01:42:23,720
The Prandhaara project

1138
01:42:25,340 --> 01:42:27,670
has been my dream for the last 20 years.

1139
01:42:28,420 --> 01:42:33,970
I am confident that this project
will benefit millions.

1140
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:35,980
And unfortunately some people
might suffer losses too.

1141
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:40,070
I'll never forget the sacrifices
made by these people

1142
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:41,620
for the progress of the nation.

1143
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:47,050
I promise to give every member
of your family a better life.

1144
01:42:47,460 --> 01:42:52,350
And I'm handing the crucial responsibility
of helping vacate these 135 villages

1145
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:58,830
to my honest and hardworking secretary
Chanchal Chauhan.

1146
01:43:01,310 --> 01:43:04,160
- Sir... Me?
- Don't be surprised. Come.

1147
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,070
Sir, thank you.

1148
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:22,010
The future of the people
from 135 villages is in your hands.

1149
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:24,410
- Yes sir.
- Here.

1150
01:43:32,610 --> 01:43:35,550
Why are you being so stubborn!

1151
01:43:35,790 --> 01:43:36,900
Shakti!

1152
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:39,140
- What happened?
- I don't want to leave the village!

1153
01:43:39,260 --> 01:43:41,630
Listen, you'll make more new friends
in the new village.

1154
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:45,660
You'll have a better school, a bigger
house, water and electricity. Okay?

1155
01:43:46,530 --> 01:43:47,890
Shakti!

1156
01:43:48,430 --> 01:43:51,320
Get the stuff quickly, before it's dark!

1157
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:55,570
Where did all this money come from?

1158
01:43:56,310 --> 01:43:57,880
They came and distributed it at night.

1159
01:43:59,890 --> 01:44:02,280
They gave money to all the villagers.

1160
01:44:02,580 --> 01:44:05,610
But the government always pays
compensation by cheque or demand draft.

1161
01:44:05,730 --> 01:44:06,830
So much cash?

1162
01:44:07,070 --> 01:44:11,200
They gave money to all the villagers.
Is something wrong?

1163
01:44:11,850 --> 01:44:13,810
No one will leave the village
till I tell you to.

1164
01:44:14,150 --> 01:44:16,200
But all the villagers...
- You heard me!

1165
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:19,530
No one leaves the village.

1166
01:44:21,310 --> 01:44:24,090
No one will leave the village
without Shakti's approval!

1167
01:44:24,890 --> 01:44:26,540
Keep your stuff back inside!

1168
01:44:27,460 --> 01:44:28,760
Who gave you this money?

1169
01:44:39,630 --> 01:44:40,180
Hello.

1170
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:43,700
Madam, this is Irrigation Officer
Rai here.

1171
01:44:43,900 --> 01:44:45,620
- Tell me.
- He's hitting me badly, madam!

1172
01:44:46,210 --> 01:44:48,670
- Who's hitting you?
- Shakti, madam!

1173
01:44:48,890 --> 01:44:50,800
- Shakti?
- Yes, madam.

1174
01:44:51,070 --> 01:44:52,670
Give Shakti the phone please.

1175
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:56,660
- Tell me.
- What is this, Shakti?

1176
01:44:57,350 --> 01:45:00,110
No matter what, you can't rough up
a government officer!

1177
01:45:00,710 --> 01:45:04,050
You've no right to lecture me
after what you've done.

1178
01:45:04,390 --> 01:45:05,750
What do you mean?
What have I done?

1179
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:07,930
I want to know what's happening
at Panna village.

1180
01:45:08,780 --> 01:45:12,590
- What about Panna village?
- Tell me the truth.

1181
01:45:12,790 --> 01:45:14,980
Hello. Shakti, please calm down.

1182
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:17,920
No! Chanchal, come to
Janta Foundation right away.

1183
01:45:18,040 --> 01:45:21,300
- Shakti, listen to me.
- No, you listen. Come here now!

1184
01:45:23,260 --> 01:45:25,340
What happened Chanchal?
Is there a problem?

1185
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:27,790
Sir, Shakti has some major anger issues.

1186
01:45:29,250 --> 01:45:32,570
If he sees anything wrong happening,
he loses control.

1187
01:45:33,950 --> 01:45:36,350
Sometimes, even I feel scared of him.

1188
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:42,770
Chanchal, we often fight
with those we love

1189
01:45:42,890 --> 01:45:45,490
only because we care deeply for them.

1190
01:45:46,330 --> 01:45:49,870
Listen, sit with him face to face
and talk to him patiently.

1191
01:45:50,370 --> 01:45:51,890
- Go home.
- Thank you sir.

1192
01:45:52,190 --> 01:45:54,210
- I'm so sorry, sir.
- Don't worry about it.

1193
01:45:54,610 --> 01:45:58,890
Madam!
Look madam. Look what he's done to me!

1194
01:46:04,750 --> 01:46:06,170
What kind of hooliganism is this, Shakti?

1195
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:08,300
Civility doesn't work while dealing
with thieves.

1196
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:10,620
Mind your language!

1197
01:46:10,970 --> 01:46:13,870
- You're talking out of anger...
- Be grateful that I'm only talking!

1198
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:17,690
Your regime should be burnt down.

1199
01:46:18,970 --> 01:46:22,250
The people here are my family, Chanchal...
And you're only a part of that family.

1200
01:46:23,630 --> 01:46:26,580
If someone betrays my family,
I won't spare them.

1201
01:46:26,700 --> 01:46:29,000
What are you talking about?
Think before you speak!

1202
01:46:29,420 --> 01:46:32,030
Really? Did you think before looting
those eight villages?

1203
01:46:32,260 --> 01:46:35,420
- Have you lost it, Shakti?
- Greed has turned you into animals...

1204
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:37,920
- I won't spare any of you!
- Shakti, no!

1205
01:46:43,810 --> 01:46:45,690
Madam! Madam!

1206
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:47,460
Kanchan has laid out dinner for you.

1207
01:46:48,150 --> 01:46:50,120
It's going to rain, please go inside!

1208
01:46:53,560 --> 01:46:55,830
Attacking an on-duty IAS officer...

1209
01:46:56,700 --> 01:47:00,980
Your brother's fingerprints were found on
the flower vase in an attacking position.

1210
01:47:01,390 --> 01:47:05,070
An IAS officer shooting in self-defence
from her personal revolver...

1211
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:06,720
It was proved quite easily.

1212
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:08,670
What are you saying, Advocate?

1213
01:47:09,690 --> 01:47:12,300
That the court can't give
my brother justice?

1214
01:47:12,610 --> 01:47:15,700
I'm sorry brother,
but it's only a matter of days...

1215
01:47:16,030 --> 01:47:17,670
Chanchal will be acquitted.

1216
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:33,430
Yes, sir.

1217
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:35,970
Get the car tank refilled.

1218
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:38,300
The fueling station is very far, sir.
It will take very long.

1219
01:47:38,420 --> 01:47:40,010
- Do as I say! Go!
- Yes sir.

1220
01:47:40,130 --> 01:47:41,180
Leave!

1221
01:47:42,630 --> 01:47:44,250
Give me the keys to the mansion.

1222
01:47:44,370 --> 01:47:45,610
Yes sir.

1223
01:47:48,220 --> 01:47:49,340
Now leave.

1224
01:47:49,730 --> 01:47:50,720
Yes sir.

1225
01:48:16,410 --> 01:48:18,410
This is a Faceless Rudraksha Seed.

1226
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:21,230
If this seed is surrounded
by positive energy

1227
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:23,320
It will turn red.

1228
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:27,590
And if it comes in contact
with negative energy

1229
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:29,800
It will turn black.

1230
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:37,360
If it starts reeking,

1231
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:42,390
It means she's possessed
by another spirit.

1232
01:49:47,660 --> 01:49:48,520
Chanchal!

1233
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:46,380
Chanchal!

1234
01:50:46,930 --> 01:50:47,740
Chanchal!

1235
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:50,950
Stop, Chanchal!

1236
01:50:52,110 --> 01:50:53,140
What are you doing?

1237
01:50:54,610 --> 01:50:55,650
Chanchal...

1238
01:50:56,660 --> 01:50:58,300
Chanchal, are you alright?

1239
01:51:01,790 --> 01:51:04,400
Chanchal... Come.

1240
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:07,460
Please take me away from here.

1241
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:10,610
Chanchal!

1242
01:51:14,430 --> 01:51:15,470
Please...

1243
01:51:15,730 --> 01:51:17,200
- Chanchal!
- Please!

1244
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:21,480
Chanchal!

1245
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:23,360
Chanchal?

1246
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:28,420
Chanchal!

1247
01:51:29,150 --> 01:51:29,910
Chanchal!

1248
01:51:36,420 --> 01:51:37,470
Chanchal!

1249
01:51:38,250 --> 01:51:39,250
Chanchal!

1250
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:53,940
Chanchal!

1251
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:04,580
What are you doing, Chanchal!

1252
01:52:07,270 --> 01:52:08,240
Chanchal!

1253
01:52:19,990 --> 01:52:21,260
Have you gone mad?

1254
01:52:51,780 --> 01:52:54,390
Get away from the fire!

1255
01:52:55,860 --> 01:52:57,400
For God's sake, move!

1256
01:52:58,910 --> 01:53:00,110
Chanchal, move!

1257
01:53:01,370 --> 01:53:02,680
Chanchal!

1258
01:54:21,150 --> 01:54:26,110
Whatever happened in the mansion
last night was beyond my understanding.

1259
01:54:26,390 --> 01:54:29,960
But seeing Chanchal's condition
and violent behaviour...

1260
01:54:30,820 --> 01:54:32,670
I had to shift her to the hospital.

1261
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:35,890
A mental hospital...

1262
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:38,630
On the psychiatrist's suggestion.

1263
01:54:38,750 --> 01:54:42,830
If only we had listened to Chanchal before,
she wouldn't have been in this state.

1264
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:47,060
Ma'am, even I feel Chanchal was right...

1265
01:54:47,430 --> 01:54:49,330
She's of no use to us anymore.

1266
01:54:49,660 --> 01:54:51,760
Her answers haven't helped us at all.

1267
01:54:51,950 --> 01:54:53,570
- Okay ma'am.
- Shift her to jail after she recovers.

1268
01:54:54,130 --> 01:54:55,960
- What about the operation?
- It's over.

1269
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:57,060
Okay ma'am.

1270
01:54:57,180 --> 01:54:59,400
ACP. Everything you told us about...

1271
01:54:59,630 --> 01:55:01,280
Why didn't the cameras capture any of it?

1272
01:55:03,150 --> 01:55:04,400
Actually...

1273
01:55:05,680 --> 01:55:06,870
There was a power failure.

1274
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:11,330
- Take care of him.
- Yes ma'am.

1275
01:55:14,750 --> 01:55:17,510
You didn't tell me a story
even last night.

1276
01:55:17,630 --> 01:55:19,040
Sorry baby.

1277
01:55:19,510 --> 01:55:22,430
Mummy's work is done. I'll tell you
a story as soon as we're home.

1278
01:55:22,550 --> 01:55:25,340
You needn't. I created a story
of my own.

1279
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:27,740
And what was this story?

1280
01:55:27,950 --> 01:55:30,100
There was a kingdom called Jehan Numa...

1281
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:32,690
- Wasn't that our hotel?
- Yes... Listen, Ma.

1282
01:55:32,810 --> 01:55:34,570
A lion was their king.

1283
01:55:34,830 --> 01:55:37,450
Their motto was 'Enjoy life now'.

1284
01:55:37,570 --> 01:55:40,120
And they believed in non-violence.

1285
01:55:40,380 --> 01:55:43,150
The king had two sons - Green and Blue.

1286
01:55:43,270 --> 01:55:46,480
The king's enemy was Donald Williams.

1287
01:55:46,710 --> 01:55:49,470
And the lion's minister was a cow.

1288
01:55:49,590 --> 01:55:51,120
A cow?

1289
01:55:51,240 --> 01:55:53,020
And then Mama got a call!

1290
01:55:53,140 --> 01:55:54,530
Mummy!

1291
01:55:56,610 --> 01:55:58,820
- Yes sir.
- Did you find out anything, Satakshi?

1292
01:55:59,450 --> 01:56:02,780
No sir. We're back to square one.

1293
01:56:02,900 --> 01:56:05,090
So much time for such a small task?

1294
01:56:05,330 --> 01:56:07,710
We're trying to find a needle
in a haystack.

1295
01:56:07,830 --> 01:56:08,870
It's going to take time.

1296
01:56:08,990 --> 01:56:11,850
Why don't you admit that
you're just not up to the job?

1297
01:56:13,510 --> 01:56:14,950
You're right, sir.

1298
01:56:15,150 --> 01:56:18,090
The truth is that Ishwar Prasad
is an honest man.

1299
01:56:18,210 --> 01:56:21,990
If you want, you can get him
arrested under some false allegation.

1300
01:56:22,110 --> 01:56:23,890
I can't do this. Bye, sir.

1301
01:56:31,970 --> 01:56:34,800
The king's enemy was Donald Williams.

1302
01:56:35,950 --> 01:56:38,220
The king had two sons - Green and Blue.

1303
01:56:40,390 --> 01:56:43,670
And the lion's minister was a cow.

1304
01:56:44,460 --> 01:56:47,560
They believed in non-violence.

1305
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:54,120
So you read all this
and told me this story?

1306
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:59,140
You only believe in your own stories,
you never listen to others.

1307
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:01,690
I never lie.

1308
01:57:38,510 --> 01:57:39,820
Jai Hind, sir.

1309
01:57:42,010 --> 01:57:43,370
Where is Chanchal?

1310
01:57:44,050 --> 01:57:46,770
- Chanchal, sir...
- Where is she?

1311
01:57:48,490 --> 01:57:51,310
She fell down in the jail washroom.
She was bleeding profusely, so...

1312
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:53,940
So you shifted her to a mental asylum?

1313
01:57:54,250 --> 01:57:56,650
The CBI fed you this story, right?

1314
01:57:58,490 --> 01:57:59,670
Not that way, sir.

1315
01:58:01,020 --> 01:58:02,250
This way.

1316
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:12,090
This is where you've kept her?

1317
01:58:16,860 --> 01:58:17,910
Jai Hind.

1318
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:39,370
Get inside!

1319
01:58:39,730 --> 01:58:40,990
Sorry sir.

1320
01:58:53,050 --> 01:58:54,860
What have you done to her!

1321
01:58:55,580 --> 01:58:57,450
Just so you could frame me...

1322
01:58:58,200 --> 01:59:00,160
You put an innocent girl's life
at stake!

1323
01:59:00,950 --> 01:59:01,930
Eat a little...

1324
01:59:02,130 --> 01:59:06,720
If you had a problem with me...
Why did you have to torture her for it?

1325
01:59:07,300 --> 01:59:08,750
Eat a little...

1326
01:59:11,050 --> 01:59:14,650
You know Chanchal well.
You know how much she's suffered.

1327
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:19,550
- Shame on you.
- Sir, please don't go inside.

1328
01:59:22,970 --> 01:59:24,490
Please sir, she's unstable.

1329
01:59:28,610 --> 01:59:29,730
Unstable!

1330
01:59:29,850 --> 01:59:31,840
Please make him understand.

1331
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:40,050
Chanchal, I'm Ishwar Prasad.

1332
01:59:44,250 --> 01:59:46,320
Come out, my dear. Come.

1333
01:59:47,480 --> 01:59:50,540
I'm here for you now.
Don't worry. Come out.

1334
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:54,840
No!

1335
01:59:55,460 --> 01:59:57,220
All of you need to get out.
Take him away.

1336
01:59:57,340 --> 02:00:00,180
- Sir please.
- Please! Please leave.

1337
02:00:03,340 --> 02:00:07,360
There's nobody here.
Just you and me.

1338
02:00:13,720 --> 02:00:14,910
Come on.

1339
02:00:18,250 --> 02:00:20,040
"One little birdie"...

1340
02:00:22,650 --> 02:00:27,640
"One little birdie, Many little birds..."

1341
02:00:27,980 --> 02:00:30,630
"Lived in the jungle,"

1342
02:00:31,010 --> 02:00:35,380
"That was their world..."

1343
02:00:38,890 --> 02:00:42,240
"Along came a hunter,
Tip-Toe-Tap..."

1344
02:00:43,580 --> 02:00:46,940
"He set the bait
And laid a trap!"

1345
02:00:47,530 --> 02:00:55,170
"The clever birds made a plan
To outsmart the evil man"

1346
02:00:57,280 --> 02:01:01,680
"He thought they were easy prey.
They lifted the net and flew away!"

1347
02:01:06,350 --> 02:01:08,060
What's happened to you, Chanchal?

1348
02:01:09,060 --> 02:01:11,790
You've suffered so much pain
because of me, right?

1349
02:01:12,160 --> 02:01:13,990
How can I ever repay you?

1350
02:01:14,580 --> 02:01:16,700
You've done so much for me.

1351
02:01:17,430 --> 02:01:19,300
What should I call this?

1352
02:01:19,830 --> 02:01:21,130
Loyalty?

1353
02:01:23,660 --> 02:01:28,410
Or have you fallen in love with me?

1354
02:01:37,030 --> 02:01:40,450
Now stop acting...
And let's get real.

1355
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:42,960
It's time to live it up.

1356
02:02:08,860 --> 02:02:12,560
"Baaz Shahbaaz was a scoundrel!"

1357
02:02:13,310 --> 02:02:15,160
Baaz Shahbaaz...

1358
02:02:16,010 --> 02:02:19,680
The glorious queen who ruled
Mahati on her fingertips!

1359
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:20,700
Mahati...

1360
02:02:29,850 --> 02:02:33,410
King Ramgopal Nandvardhan Bhattarika...

1361
02:02:46,690 --> 02:02:47,830
Damn it!

1362
02:02:48,420 --> 02:02:50,860
Chanchal cooked up a story
just like my daughter!

1363
02:02:53,060 --> 02:02:54,910
Durgamati is a fake story!

1364
02:02:55,320 --> 02:02:57,050
That's my girl!

1365
02:02:59,010 --> 02:03:00,290
Did you get scared?

1366
02:03:21,090 --> 02:03:22,810
Durga... Durga...

1367
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:25,120
Durgamati!

1368
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:31,690
No one had the slightest clue...
That you were putting up a show!

1369
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:35,060
Jose has been keeping me updated.

1370
02:03:39,270 --> 02:03:43,820
These CBI guys think that
Durgamati's spirit has possessed you!

1371
02:03:44,860 --> 02:03:47,580
And what's her name?
That bloody over-confident...

1372
02:03:47,850 --> 02:03:49,200
Satakshi Ganguly!

1373
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:50,900
She thinks she's really smart...

1374
02:03:51,020 --> 02:03:52,900
She's been trying to trap me.

1375
02:03:53,020 --> 02:03:54,190
She's crazy!

1376
02:03:54,310 --> 02:03:55,600
She's mad!

1377
02:03:56,300 --> 02:04:00,580
She doesn't realize that a herd of sheep
can't hunt down a lion!

1378
02:04:04,490 --> 02:04:07,400
Listen. Just fake it for 6 more months.

1379
02:04:08,250 --> 02:04:10,170
Just 6 months.

1380
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:14,220
All this will be buried and forgotten.

1381
02:04:15,210 --> 02:04:19,430
And then we'll fly off,
just like your birds!

1382
02:04:26,360 --> 02:04:28,380
I completed my promise.

1383
02:04:29,290 --> 02:04:31,160
Your 3 billion rupees are in your bank.

1384
02:04:31,690 --> 02:04:33,030
Brother, what was my mistake?

1385
02:04:33,150 --> 02:04:35,710
You slapped and insulted me
in front of everyone!

1386
02:04:35,830 --> 02:04:39,150
You don't understand politics.

1387
02:04:41,070 --> 02:04:46,930
The Prandhaara project will only
benefit us, not the public.

1388
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:52,650
And so under the pretext of the dam

1389
02:04:53,360 --> 02:04:55,940
I got those 8 villages vacated.

1390
02:04:57,440 --> 02:05:00,210
The bauxite that will be mined
from there...

1391
02:05:01,900 --> 02:05:05,560
Will light up our lives!

1392
02:05:06,380 --> 02:05:09,120
All thanks to our friends over here.

1393
02:05:09,590 --> 02:05:10,670
Cheers.

1394
02:05:10,790 --> 02:05:13,290
We're getting 18 billion rupees from them.

1395
02:05:13,410 --> 02:05:15,050
Now that's what you call politics.

1396
02:05:15,950 --> 02:05:20,020
Thank you for letting me know
about the CBI enquiry.

1397
02:05:20,830 --> 02:05:25,160
They're setting up a CBI enquiry to try
and nab me.

1398
02:05:25,500 --> 02:05:31,580
They're thinking of interrogating you
so they can hunt me down.

1399
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:34,570
They'll ask you about my illegal deals...

1400
02:05:34,930 --> 02:05:39,750
You need to keep singing praises
of my selfless social service.

1401
02:05:40,180 --> 02:05:46,150
The Ahluwalia group has given me
18 billion to pass the Prandhaara project.

1402
02:05:46,590 --> 02:05:49,910
How much will you take to save me
from the CBI?

1403
02:05:50,510 --> 02:05:51,700
50 percent.

1404
02:05:53,090 --> 02:05:54,330
Half!

1405
02:05:55,940 --> 02:05:56,930
3 billion.

1406
02:05:58,980 --> 02:06:00,560
Why should I trust you?

1407
02:06:01,060 --> 02:06:05,500
Okay so I'll transfer the entire amount
in your name.

1408
02:06:06,780 --> 02:06:10,120
Safe country. Safe account.

1409
02:06:10,630 --> 02:06:13,900
One the job is done,
you can transfer 15 billion back to me.

1410
02:06:15,570 --> 02:06:17,230
Just sign this, that's it.

1411
02:06:18,810 --> 02:06:20,320
And remember.

1412
02:06:20,550 --> 02:06:23,870
A lot will be riding on your tongue
during the interrogation...

1413
02:06:24,100 --> 02:06:27,840
One slip, and 3 billion will go
down the drain. Got it?

1414
02:06:29,420 --> 02:06:30,740
Thanks.

1415
02:06:37,610 --> 02:06:40,760
What happened?
Anything else you want from me?

1416
02:06:42,720 --> 02:06:45,070
I should be asking you that question.

1417
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:47,770
What else do you want from me?

1418
02:06:53,290 --> 02:06:54,590
Smart.

1419
02:06:55,450 --> 02:06:56,260
Smart!

1420
02:06:56,430 --> 02:06:58,930
Tell the ACP to keep Chanchal there.

1421
02:06:59,050 --> 02:07:00,870
And find out where Ishwar Prasad is.

1422
02:07:00,990 --> 02:07:04,300
Madam. Someone is here to see you.

1423
02:07:04,760 --> 02:07:06,010
Meet me?

1424
02:07:08,250 --> 02:07:09,770
You were right, Ajay.

1425
02:07:09,990 --> 02:07:13,150
This is a conspiracy against me...
which I can handle.

1426
02:07:13,390 --> 02:07:17,300
But I won't tolerate the torture
of an innocent young woman!

1427
02:07:17,870 --> 02:07:19,750
The public should be
made aware of this.

1428
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:21,240
- Announce a press conference.
- Okay sir.

1429
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:23,130
- And call human rights activists as well.
- Yes sir.

1430
02:07:23,250 --> 02:07:24,830
Please don't call the press, sir.

1431
02:07:24,950 --> 02:07:28,250
The police aren't responsible for this.
She was attacked by a ghost!

1432
02:07:28,370 --> 02:07:30,320
She'll be fine if she rests for 6 months.

1433
02:07:30,780 --> 02:07:32,100
6 months?

1434
02:07:32,640 --> 02:07:34,720
- Sir please try to...
- The press conference will happen.

1435
02:07:34,840 --> 02:07:36,330
Today and right here.

1436
02:07:36,910 --> 02:07:38,030
Sir.

1437
02:07:42,940 --> 02:07:45,480
Have you booked the chartered flight
to Switzerland?

1438
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:47,680
- Is all the stuff loaded?
- Yes.

1439
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:49,680
- When are we leaving?
- The day after.

1440
02:07:50,140 --> 02:07:53,030
And this bloody...
He's talking about 6 months.

1441
02:07:53,150 --> 02:07:54,400
Has he gone mad?

1442
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:58,450
But sir, why did you open
a foreign bank account for her

1443
02:07:58,570 --> 02:08:00,920
and transfer the entire 18 billion
in her name?

1444
02:08:01,140 --> 02:08:04,820
Won't we need her signature
to get our 15 billion now?

1445
02:08:04,940 --> 02:08:06,350
How much?

1446
02:08:06,510 --> 02:08:07,520
- 15 billion...
- Nope.

1447
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:10,080
18 billion.

1448
02:08:10,530 --> 02:08:12,130
The entire amount.

1449
02:08:12,250 --> 02:08:15,160
- Do I look like a fool? Do I?
- No sir.

1450
02:08:17,430 --> 02:08:19,710
You know why I put the money
in her name?

1451
02:08:19,830 --> 02:08:20,860
Why sir?

1452
02:08:20,980 --> 02:08:23,980
So she keeps shut in front of the CBI.

1453
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:27,190
And if she tries any mischief...

1454
02:08:27,880 --> 02:08:32,310
I'll give the government the details
of her foreign account.

1455
02:08:32,980 --> 02:08:37,350
An 18 billion rupee scam...
She'll rot in jail forever!

1456
02:08:37,690 --> 02:08:40,570
But the ACP said she'll be
released after 6 months...

1457
02:08:40,980 --> 02:08:43,040
She's crazy! And corrupt.

1458
02:08:43,430 --> 02:08:45,330
She killed her husband.

1459
02:08:45,450 --> 02:08:47,920
Once someone goes in,
they don't get out!

1460
02:08:48,120 --> 02:08:49,920
And if she gets out, you'll go to jail.

1461
02:08:50,040 --> 02:08:51,380
No chance, sir!

1462
02:08:52,450 --> 02:08:58,950
Now there's only one thing
between me and that 18 billion...

1463
02:08:59,070 --> 02:09:00,680
The road, sir?

1464
02:09:01,030 --> 02:09:03,520
You ought to have
'idiot' tattooed across your face.

1465
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:04,950
Signature!

1466
02:09:05,070 --> 02:09:06,690
- Get her signature!
- Yes sir.

1467
02:09:07,210 --> 02:09:08,610
What a jackass.

1468
02:09:08,980 --> 02:09:10,920
What's that award actors get
in Hollywood?

1469
02:09:11,040 --> 02:09:12,470
The Oscars?

1470
02:09:12,590 --> 02:09:15,620
Yeah, call them and tell them
to watch out for my performance.

1471
02:09:16,420 --> 02:09:19,400
Ma'am, I'm the registrar
of the Prandhaara project area.

1472
02:09:19,700 --> 02:09:22,350
- Prandhaara project?
- Yes ma'am. Here.

1473
02:09:23,100 --> 02:09:26,440
It has all the land registration details
of this area

1474
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:28,880
from 6 months before the
Prandhaara project began.

1475
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,390
Please go through it.

1476
02:09:30,680 --> 02:09:33,790
Land registration worth 350 million
in just 6 months...

1477
02:09:34,130 --> 02:09:35,910
That too in this tiny village?

1478
02:09:37,900 --> 02:09:40,610
Which means... Insider trading.

1479
02:09:41,760 --> 02:09:45,980
So someone already knew the
Prandhaara project would happen there.

1480
02:09:48,210 --> 02:09:49,970
- Ishwar Prasad?
- Yes, madam.

1481
02:09:50,090 --> 02:09:52,380
Before the government project started,

1482
02:09:52,500 --> 02:09:58,050
Ishwar Prasad bought 1000 acres of land in
neighbouring villages at dirt cheap prices

1483
02:09:58,240 --> 02:10:01,570
By cheating the villagers.

1484
02:10:06,860 --> 02:10:11,020
And sold the same land to the government
at a high compensation.

1485
02:10:14,890 --> 02:10:17,430
And apart from Panna,
people from every other village

1486
02:10:17,550 --> 02:10:19,660
- happily gave their land away.
- Panna village?

1487
02:10:19,780 --> 02:10:21,370
Yes madam. Panna village.

1488
02:10:21,680 --> 02:10:24,380
It was the only village
opposed to the project.

1489
02:10:26,340 --> 02:10:31,710
But the 'God-fearing Ishwar Prasad'
didn't spare the villagers, or their God.

1490
02:10:42,250 --> 02:10:48,960
You must be wondering why
I'm in front of a mental asylum

1491
02:10:49,930 --> 02:10:52,230
holding a sudden press conference.

1492
02:10:53,710 --> 02:10:57,440
It's because I want to tell you
what's going on behind these walls.

1493
02:10:57,690 --> 02:11:00,740
I want to present the truth
to the whole country.

1494
02:11:01,270 --> 02:11:06,200
An honest, sincere IAS officer
is being tortured

1495
02:11:06,320 --> 02:11:08,920
to extract a false statement against me.

1496
02:11:09,190 --> 02:11:11,180
This is how low our politicians stoop.

1497
02:11:11,650 --> 02:11:13,190
I feel so repulsed.

1498
02:11:13,880 --> 02:11:17,330
I'm quitting politics.
In fact, I'm going to leave the country.

1499
02:11:17,770 --> 02:11:18,950
Please don't stop me.

1500
02:11:19,570 --> 02:11:20,630
Sir!

1501
02:11:24,850 --> 02:11:27,720
Look! God knows what they're
doing to that girl inside.

1502
02:11:29,620 --> 02:11:32,130
I want you to watch this live.

1503
02:11:32,700 --> 02:11:35,190
Watch it and share it with the world!

1504
02:11:35,980 --> 02:11:37,670
- Jai Hind sir!
- Leave.

1505
02:11:39,880 --> 02:11:41,810
- Did she sign?
- She did this!

1506
02:11:43,140 --> 02:11:44,350
Chanchal!

1507
02:11:46,890 --> 02:11:48,720
Chanchal dear, I'm Uncle Pramod.

1508
02:11:49,620 --> 02:11:52,840
I've been working with this rascal
for 20 years

1509
02:11:53,240 --> 02:11:57,710
and never got an extra penny.
And you get 3 billion!

1510
02:11:59,050 --> 02:12:00,830
What to do. I'm just a peon.

1511
02:12:00,950 --> 02:12:04,740
Getting signatures and putting all the
money in his brother's account is my job.

1512
02:12:05,040 --> 02:12:06,360
Sign it.

1513
02:12:07,970 --> 02:12:08,900
Come on!

1514
02:12:10,300 --> 02:12:11,380
Chanchal, sign!

1515
02:12:12,540 --> 02:12:13,880
Durgamati!

1516
02:12:18,040 --> 02:12:19,940
Don't try this drama with me.

1517
02:12:20,060 --> 02:12:22,860
Here. Sign.
Come on, sign!

1518
02:12:23,150 --> 02:12:24,610
Durgamati!

1519
02:12:33,450 --> 02:12:35,200
What's this nonsense?

1520
02:12:37,960 --> 02:12:41,300
You told me to keep faking it.

1521
02:12:48,340 --> 02:12:50,860
And you got so into character
that you stabbed his hand with a pen?

1522
02:12:51,610 --> 02:12:52,830
He's terrified!

1523
02:13:00,780 --> 02:13:02,330
Earning money illegally...

1524
02:13:02,450 --> 02:13:04,330
His son's education in America...

1525
02:13:04,450 --> 02:13:05,590
His secret farmhouse...

1526
02:13:05,710 --> 02:13:08,410
You won't find anything against him
from me or anyone else.

1527
02:13:09,990 --> 02:13:11,920
He loves visiting ancient temples

1528
02:13:12,580 --> 02:13:13,860
To steal idols...

1529
02:13:14,930 --> 02:13:16,660
The amount quoted
by the Ahluwalia group...

1530
02:13:16,780 --> 02:13:18,710
He could easily earn billions
with one signature...

1531
02:13:18,830 --> 02:13:21,470
He plans to hoard money in 6 months
and escape the country...

1532
02:13:21,790 --> 02:13:25,600
You're so convinced of your story
that you're not listening to me.

1533
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:27,860
I'm telling you the truth.

1534
02:13:27,980 --> 02:13:29,360
Think big. Think big!

1535
02:13:29,480 --> 02:13:30,590
Think big!

1536
02:13:32,740 --> 02:13:36,210
Baaz Shahbaaz was a scoundrel!

1537
02:13:36,730 --> 02:13:38,420
I, Ishwar Prasad...

1538
02:13:39,330 --> 02:13:45,290
My people gave him love and support...

1539
02:13:45,410 --> 02:13:47,070
Made him our army chief!

1540
02:13:47,190 --> 02:13:52,800
I pledge that I'll dedicate my life
to the service of this nation...

1541
02:13:53,550 --> 02:13:57,600
I trusted his intentions
and gave him respect and power

1542
02:13:58,220 --> 02:14:00,420
IAS Chanchal, it's a pleasure.

1543
02:14:00,540 --> 02:14:02,110
I'm at your service, sir.

1544
02:14:02,440 --> 02:14:06,120
As soon as he got power,
he revealed his true colours.

1545
02:14:06,450 --> 02:14:08,400
He looted our wealth, our land!

1546
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:11,500
O Almighty, he didn't even spare you!

1547
02:14:14,760 --> 02:14:16,650
Chanchal wasn't lying to us.

1548
02:14:16,990 --> 02:14:19,130
In fact, she told us
Ishwar Prasad's truth.

1549
02:14:20,180 --> 02:14:24,600
As my personal secretary,
your signature has benefited me a lot.

1550
02:14:25,010 --> 02:14:28,250
Now for both of us,
do this last signature.

1551
02:14:29,660 --> 02:14:33,480
To save wolves in sheep's clothing
like me,

1552
02:14:34,360 --> 02:14:37,070
people like you have to make sacrifices.

1553
02:14:37,930 --> 02:14:40,750
That's how the world functions.
Can I make a confession?

1554
02:14:41,930 --> 02:14:45,270
Really... I didn't expect you to

1555
02:14:45,830 --> 02:14:48,780
fulfill my thirst for money so easily.

1556
02:14:49,130 --> 02:14:50,840
Thank you. Here.

1557
02:14:51,750 --> 02:14:54,820
What about the stolen idols?

1558
02:14:59,260 --> 02:15:01,600
You sure know a lot. Good.

1559
02:15:02,200 --> 02:15:04,360
The idols go with me to Switzerland.

1560
02:15:04,700 --> 02:15:06,350
They'll be auctioned there.

1561
02:15:06,890 --> 02:15:07,720
Okay?

1562
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:09,350
That's my side-income...

1563
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:11,440
And a blot on the government.

1564
02:15:11,910 --> 02:15:13,730
We gotta do what we gotta do.

1565
02:15:34,080 --> 02:15:35,310
Who is Durgamati?

1566
02:15:35,940 --> 02:15:37,470
Have you really gone mad?

1567
02:15:37,670 --> 02:15:41,270
"The clever birds made a plan"

1568
02:15:42,390 --> 02:15:46,940
"To outsmart the evil man"

1569
02:15:49,450 --> 02:15:54,910
"He thought they were easy prey.
They lifted the net and flew away!"

1570
02:15:56,680 --> 02:16:01,380
You're so blinded by greed,
that you couldn't see

1571
02:16:01,870 --> 02:16:05,860
that this time, I set the bait
and laid the trap.

1572
02:16:07,230 --> 02:16:10,050
You are trapped.

1573
02:16:10,970 --> 02:16:12,080
Trapped?

1574
02:16:12,590 --> 02:16:16,190
Idols are being stolen from temples
and this government is doing nothing.

1575
02:16:16,310 --> 02:16:19,070
I don't want to be part
of this government anymore.

1576
02:16:19,260 --> 02:16:20,790
I challenge the government...

1577
02:16:21,370 --> 02:16:23,800
If the thieves aren't caught in 15 days

1578
02:16:23,920 --> 02:16:26,760
And the idols aren't re-installed
in the temples...

1579
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:28,740
I'll quit politics.

1580
02:16:53,230 --> 02:16:54,120
Sir.

1581
02:16:54,240 --> 02:16:58,440
Ishwar Prasad has hatched a nasty plot
to tarnish our government's reputation.

1582
02:16:58,840 --> 02:17:01,360
Order a CBI inquiry in this case.

1583
02:17:01,640 --> 02:17:04,750
You can put pressure from the top
and get Ishwar Prasad behind bars.

1584
02:17:09,130 --> 02:17:10,380
So you...

1585
02:17:13,110 --> 02:17:15,450
You betrayed me?

1586
02:17:16,560 --> 02:17:19,810
I've only betrayed you Ishwar Prasad.

1587
02:17:21,140 --> 02:17:22,410
And you?

1588
02:17:23,510 --> 02:17:27,230
My integrity, my country,

1589
02:17:27,540 --> 02:17:31,020
my people, my love...
You took everything away from me!

1590
02:17:32,740 --> 02:17:35,600
Look madam. Look what he's done to me!

1591
02:17:37,100 --> 02:17:38,580
What kind of hooliganism is this, Shakti?

1592
02:17:38,880 --> 02:17:40,710
Civility doesn't work
while dealing with thieves.

1593
02:17:41,010 --> 02:17:42,350
Think before you speak!

1594
02:17:42,670 --> 02:17:45,470
Really? Did you think before looting
those eight villages?

1595
02:17:46,290 --> 02:17:47,780
What eight villages?

1596
02:17:48,170 --> 02:17:50,620
Who have I looted...
Have you lost it, Shakti?

1597
02:17:50,850 --> 02:17:52,150
Have I lost it?

1598
02:17:52,870 --> 02:17:56,260
The project bears your signatures.
You're the chief of the project committee.

1599
02:17:56,500 --> 02:17:58,090
And you don't know which eight villages?

1600
02:17:58,740 --> 02:17:59,880
Prandhaara project.

1601
02:18:00,250 --> 02:18:03,620
127 villages were supposed to be vacated
for the Prandhaara project.

1602
02:18:03,830 --> 02:18:06,080
But 135 villages are being vacated.

1603
02:18:06,800 --> 02:18:07,750
Why?

1604
02:18:08,150 --> 02:18:10,890
Why were these 8 villages added
to the list for no reason?

1605
02:18:12,140 --> 02:18:14,190
Shakti. I..

1606
02:18:14,710 --> 02:18:16,700
I can't believe that you...

1607
02:18:17,860 --> 02:18:21,510
That you pretended to love me
so you could get the villages vacated.

1608
02:18:21,940 --> 02:18:23,480
You used me, Chanchal!

1609
02:18:24,120 --> 02:18:26,280
Shakti, I knew nothing
about those 8 villages...

1610
02:18:26,530 --> 02:18:28,770
How could this happen
without your knowledge, Chanchal?

1611
02:18:29,510 --> 02:18:31,020
Yes, Chanchal!

1612
02:18:31,350 --> 02:18:32,650
Answer him.

1613
02:18:32,880 --> 02:18:34,550
Answer Shakti's questions!

1614
02:18:35,400 --> 02:18:37,110
Sir, you're here?

1615
02:18:37,480 --> 02:18:41,280
You've put a blot on my
unblemished career of 35 years...

1616
02:18:41,520 --> 02:18:43,090
I trusted you.

1617
02:18:43,620 --> 02:18:46,420
People are beginning to doubt
all my hard work of the last 10 years.

1618
02:18:46,540 --> 02:18:48,720
Do you doubt me too, Sir?

1619
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:50,430
No, not me.

1620
02:18:50,550 --> 02:18:54,020
That's what Shakti's thinking.
And soon, everyone will.

1621
02:18:54,370 --> 02:18:58,800
But Shakti, you mustn't give Chanchal
credit for my hard work.

1622
02:19:00,840 --> 02:19:05,910
Because I'm the mastermind
behind the Prandhaara project.

1623
02:19:06,510 --> 02:19:08,570
The squeaky-clean

1624
02:19:08,980 --> 02:19:14,300
Minister of Water Resources,
Ishwar Prasad! Applause!

1625
02:19:18,190 --> 02:19:24,540
Actually, there's bauxite worth billions
hidden beneath those 8 villages.

1626
02:19:24,660 --> 02:19:27,190
I wouldn't miss a chance to grab that.

1627
02:19:27,590 --> 02:19:33,660
If I told them I was after the bauxite,
the villagers wouldn't agree to leave.

1628
02:19:34,880 --> 02:19:40,830
So under the facade of the Dam,
I used you to get the villages vacated.

1629
02:19:41,190 --> 02:19:42,810
Forget 135 villages.

1630
02:19:43,080 --> 02:19:46,150
Now you won't even be able
to move a stone.

1631
02:19:46,850 --> 02:19:49,420
This is the problem
with you revolutionaries.

1632
02:19:50,860 --> 02:19:54,610
You're barely out of your diapers
and you want to change the country.

1633
02:19:55,020 --> 02:19:59,730
Your greed has turned you into a beast.
But I won't let you get away!

1634
02:20:00,820 --> 02:20:02,590
Shakti! Shakti, stop!

1635
02:20:05,260 --> 02:20:09,220
I didn't turn into a beast.
I was born this way!

1636
02:20:25,230 --> 02:20:26,200
Shakti!

1637
02:20:26,320 --> 02:20:28,900
Shakti, please save me!
These people will kill me.

1638
02:20:29,020 --> 02:20:30,560
Please save me, Shakti!

1639
02:20:32,720 --> 02:20:34,840
Go on, kill them!

1640
02:20:36,250 --> 02:20:38,350
Fine, then let me do it.
- Leave him!

1641
02:20:38,860 --> 02:20:42,230
You're looting the very people
who gave you love and respect?

1642
02:20:42,350 --> 02:20:45,020
Have you gone crazy
in your lust for money and power?

1643
02:20:48,120 --> 02:20:49,470
I am crazy.

1644
02:20:50,500 --> 02:20:52,570
Everyone is crazy for something.

1645
02:20:52,890 --> 02:20:56,300
This hero here is crazy
about serving the country.

1646
02:20:56,570 --> 02:20:58,080
You're crazily in love with him.

1647
02:20:58,260 --> 02:20:59,400
And I...

1648
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:02,020
I'm crazy about money.

1649
02:21:03,590 --> 02:21:07,330
I want to loot the country,
go abroad and have a blast.

1650
02:21:08,460 --> 02:21:11,050
I don't want to spend my life
switching between parties.

1651
02:21:11,370 --> 02:21:12,990
I want to switch between women.

1652
02:21:14,490 --> 02:21:17,180
And if someone gets in the way
of what I want, I'll kill them!

1653
02:21:17,300 --> 02:21:18,090
Stop!

1654
02:21:18,210 --> 02:21:21,250
If you kill him, the villagers
won't leave.

1655
02:21:21,580 --> 02:21:23,050
They'll tear you to pieces!

1656
02:21:24,500 --> 02:21:26,720
That's her problem.
She's too intelligent!

1657
02:21:27,110 --> 02:21:29,900
You have a point.
Why don't you kill him instead?

1658
02:21:30,500 --> 02:21:33,140
Hand her the gun.
It's your gun anyway.

1659
02:21:37,590 --> 02:21:38,830
Come on, shoot.

1660
02:21:39,210 --> 02:21:41,360
You won't succeed even if you kill me.

1661
02:21:41,480 --> 02:21:44,300
By now, the villagers would
know what you did.

1662
02:21:44,420 --> 02:21:47,720
You can kill me,
but not the power of our people!

1663
02:21:49,360 --> 02:21:50,370
Holy shit!

1664
02:21:52,520 --> 02:21:53,610
Give me that.

1665
02:21:55,310 --> 02:21:57,580
You sent them to stop the villagers,
right?

1666
02:22:01,640 --> 02:22:02,980
We haven't done anything!

1667
02:22:11,410 --> 02:22:12,600
You bastard!

1668
02:22:13,170 --> 02:22:14,540
This is a recording.

1669
02:22:15,660 --> 02:22:17,760
You want to see the live show?

1670
02:22:18,120 --> 02:22:20,010
Let's watch some live footage!

1671
02:22:21,630 --> 02:22:22,710
See...

1672
02:22:35,880 --> 02:22:38,360
You didn't want them
to leave the village...

1673
02:22:39,590 --> 02:22:41,670
Now they're going to leave this world!

1674
02:22:47,520 --> 02:22:48,760
Leave me!

1675
02:23:09,650 --> 02:23:10,760
Come on, shoot!

1676
02:23:11,230 --> 02:23:14,570
Come on! That's how you hold the gun...
That's it!

1677
02:23:14,870 --> 02:23:16,920
What happened? Shoot him!

1678
02:23:17,310 --> 02:23:18,230
Shoot him!

1679
02:23:18,440 --> 02:23:21,740
Till he is alive, the villagers
will keep dying.

1680
02:23:22,040 --> 02:23:23,790
Please Chanchal please, shoot!

1681
02:23:24,430 --> 02:23:26,480
And this officer will die too.

1682
02:23:26,770 --> 02:23:28,350
Please Chanchal, shoot!

1683
02:23:28,470 --> 02:23:31,430
By taking one life, you'll save so many...

1684
02:23:31,860 --> 02:23:33,690
Shoot him, Chanchal. Come on, shoot him!

1685
02:23:35,050 --> 02:23:36,610
Give that to me.

1686
02:23:37,050 --> 02:23:38,380
That pregnant woman there, kill her!

1687
02:23:43,560 --> 02:23:44,360
Look!

1688
02:23:44,760 --> 02:23:48,720
Because of you, a mother
and her unborn child will die.

1689
02:23:52,730 --> 02:23:56,390
Please, Chanchal...
Just shoot me, Chanchal please!

1690
02:23:58,990 --> 02:24:01,240
I can't have people dying because of me.

1691
02:24:01,360 --> 02:24:03,270
I'd rather you shoot me, Chanchal.
Please!

1692
02:24:04,020 --> 02:24:05,240
Shoot him!

1693
02:24:14,880 --> 02:24:16,070
Chanchal...

1694
02:24:16,850 --> 02:24:19,060
Come on Chanchal, shoot him!

1695
02:24:19,540 --> 02:24:21,830
Chanchal, please just shoot me!

1696
02:24:25,610 --> 02:24:27,850
Chanchal, please shoot...

1697
02:24:30,420 --> 02:24:31,510
Oh come on!

1698
02:25:03,920 --> 02:25:05,100
Finally!

1699
02:25:07,030 --> 02:25:12,770
Now you can spend the rest of your life
in jail for killing your lover.

1700
02:25:13,420 --> 02:25:16,270
Until I finish the project
and leave the country

1701
02:25:16,390 --> 02:25:17,900
You better keep your mouth shut...

1702
02:25:18,320 --> 02:25:22,930
Or I'll kill the rest of the villagers
and send the recordings to you in jail.

1703
02:25:23,770 --> 02:25:26,210
Take care of yourself. Bye.

1704
02:25:29,960 --> 02:25:32,150
I gave you an answer

1705
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,420
in the only language you understand.

1706
02:25:38,700 --> 02:25:39,750
Deceit.

1707
02:25:39,870 --> 02:25:45,660
You want to hand me to the CBI
and grab the entire 18 billion, right?

1708
02:25:48,140 --> 02:25:50,780
Remember what I did to
the people of Panna village?

1709
02:25:50,900 --> 02:25:52,870
How brutally they were killed?

1710
02:25:54,230 --> 02:25:58,290
I've kept some villagers captive
at my farmhouse. Should I kill them?

1711
02:26:00,080 --> 02:26:03,000
The land you were trying to steal

1712
02:26:03,700 --> 02:26:08,310
Is ready to swallow you whole.

1713
02:26:10,150 --> 02:26:13,250
I'll show everyone your real face.

1714
02:26:14,870 --> 02:26:16,620
Wait and watch!

1715
02:26:22,770 --> 02:26:25,780
Remember what I did to
the people of Panna village?

1716
02:27:21,500 --> 02:27:25,400
The power of a king lies in his wealth,
people and his mind.

1717
02:27:26,430 --> 02:27:28,440
I've taken all your money.

1718
02:27:29,120 --> 02:27:32,940
People hate you, now that
I've shown them your reality.

1719
02:27:35,190 --> 02:27:36,760
As for your mind...

1720
02:27:38,700 --> 02:27:41,860
Now that your revolver is out,
it's pretty clear...

1721
02:27:41,980 --> 02:27:45,450
You've lost your mind as well.

1722
02:27:45,740 --> 02:27:51,860
I'm not putting a blot
on your unblemished 35 year career...

1723
02:27:53,650 --> 02:27:57,340
I'm destroying it completely.

1724
02:28:44,510 --> 02:28:45,610
You are watching Live.

1725
02:28:45,730 --> 02:28:48,940
Central Minister Mr Ishwar Prasad
has been shot by the police...

1726
02:28:49,060 --> 02:28:51,360
Minister Ishwar Prasad was killed
in a shootout

1727
02:28:51,720 --> 02:28:54,540
after he shot at an innocent
IAS officer...

1728
02:28:57,050 --> 02:28:58,450
Chanchal!

1729
02:28:58,820 --> 02:29:00,770
Not just Shakti...

1730
02:29:02,910 --> 02:29:05,490
Ishwar Prasad killed
so many of our people.

1731
02:29:11,410 --> 02:29:12,470
Breaking News!

1732
02:29:12,740 --> 02:29:14,390
After attacking IAS Chanchal Chauhan,

1733
02:29:14,510 --> 02:29:17,240
Minister Ishwar Prasad was shot down
by police...

1734
02:29:34,800 --> 02:29:38,570
These are Chanchal's childhood photos...
With her parents.

1735
02:29:40,070 --> 02:29:44,250
She used her talents amazingly
to achieve her goals.

1736
02:29:46,080 --> 02:29:50,190
Yes. Shakti's dream was to help the
villagers through the Prandhaara project...

1737
02:29:50,380 --> 02:29:54,120
And now Chanchal has fulfilled that dream
with the Shakti Foundation.

1738
02:29:54,310 --> 02:29:56,780
If Shakti was around,
he'd be so proud of her.

1739
02:29:56,990 --> 02:30:00,200
I know that he is proud.

1740
02:30:01,110 --> 02:30:03,260
Because Shakti is always with me.

1741
02:30:03,480 --> 02:30:04,670
Of course.

1742
02:30:05,970 --> 02:30:09,310
Actually, we were wondering...

1743
02:30:10,430 --> 02:30:12,550
How did you pull this off?

1744
02:30:13,250 --> 02:30:16,850
Everything makes sense...
But there's one doubt.

1745
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:22,280
What's the deal with the witch-doctor
and the Rudraksha?

1746
02:30:37,060 --> 02:30:38,160
Very good.

1747
02:30:38,410 --> 02:30:42,520
But as per the plan,
I was supposed to shoot Ishwar Prasad.

1748
02:30:43,140 --> 02:30:45,050
But by the time I got there, he was...

1749
02:30:45,170 --> 02:30:47,230
No mother gives birth to a demon.

1750
02:30:47,350 --> 02:30:50,600
And whoever becomes a demon...
Is ultimately killed by a Mother Goddess.

1751
02:30:50,830 --> 02:30:52,250
That's what happened.

1752
02:30:52,440 --> 02:30:54,210
You're right.

1753
02:30:54,730 --> 02:30:56,710
But why did you have to do all this?

1754
02:30:56,970 --> 02:30:59,290
You could've just told us
everything before.

1755
02:31:00,350 --> 02:31:03,190
Who believes in humans anymore?

1756
02:31:04,340 --> 02:31:06,900
People only want to believe in God
or the Devil.

1757
02:31:10,710 --> 02:31:13,850
This is the first case in my career
I couldn't solve.

1758
02:31:14,120 --> 02:31:17,220
We thought we had all your details.

1759
02:31:17,520 --> 02:31:21,810
We didn't know you practice magic
and speak Arabic.

1760
02:31:24,410 --> 02:31:25,630
Arabic?

1761
02:31:26,660 --> 02:31:28,280
I don't speak Arabic.

1762
02:31:34,340 --> 02:31:38,950
You don't speak Arabic?

1763
02:31:48,420 --> 02:31:50,250
Durgamati!

1764
02:32:09,380 --> 02:32:11,000
Durgamati!

1765
02:32:11,920 --> 02:32:14,560
Nandu! When will the electricity
come back?

1766
02:32:14,810 --> 02:32:17,170
All the electric poles fell
during the storm!

1767
02:32:18,010 --> 02:32:19,920
The power won't be back until morning.
