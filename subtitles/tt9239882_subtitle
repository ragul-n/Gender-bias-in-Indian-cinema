'Before playing your favourite music,
here's important news for today.'

'Don't worry.
The tour will resume in three days.'

12
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:32,577
'Meanwhile, there are plenty of
other sight-seeing options in Malaysia.'

13

(Song from 'Thoongaa Vanam')

19
00:06:06,057 --> 00:06:07,097
Change of plan.

20
00:06:07,137 --> 00:06:08,297
Plan change?

21
00:06:08,337 --> 00:06:09,817
Two men are chasing me.

22
00:06:09,857 --> 00:06:10,977
Who are they?

23
00:06:11,297 --> 00:06:14,337
I don't know.
Meet me at the other end of the tunnel.

24
00:06:14,377 --> 00:06:15,617
I'll be there.

25
00:06:50,137 --> 00:06:51,577
No...no

26
00:07:50,897 --> 00:07:52,177
Let's leave.

27
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:57,097
Give way.
Please step aside.

28
00:07:57,337 --> 00:07:59,457
Move away

29
00:08:38,377 --> 00:08:41,297
Good. The baby is
in the correct position.

30
00:08:45,137 --> 00:08:47,097
Can we get
a copy of the scan image?

31
00:08:47,177 --> 00:08:49,577
Sure. I'll mail it
along with the reports.

32
00:08:50,137 --> 00:08:51,297
Okay!

33
00:08:56,697 --> 00:08:58,737
I saw your test results.

34
00:08:58,777 --> 00:09:01,017
So, this is
your second visit. Right?

35
00:09:01,057 --> 00:09:02,417
Yes, doctor.

36
00:09:02,497 --> 00:09:05,057
We visited you
the day after we landed in Malaysia.

37
00:09:05,657 --> 00:09:08,417
The report says that
her blood pressure is borderline.

38
00:09:08,457 --> 00:09:09,857
Slightly higher than normal.

39
00:09:10,097 --> 00:09:12,457
But, don't worry.
Just be a little careful, Ok.

40
00:09:13,897 --> 00:09:16,057
What does it mean
in layman's terms?

41
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:19,417
It means you have to eat well
and be a little careful. That's it.

42
00:09:19,457 --> 00:09:21,977
Nothing to worry.
Avoid physical activities.

43
00:09:22,017 --> 00:09:23,097
Take plenty of rest.

44
00:09:23,177 --> 00:09:24,577
Give her the medicines
without fail.

45
00:09:24,617 --> 00:09:25,017
Sure

46
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,377
Do you have elders at home
to take care of you?

47
00:09:28,937 --> 00:09:31,097
If there is no one
tell him to take care of you.

48
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:34,337
One more thing.
Avoid travel from now on.

49
00:09:34,777 --> 00:09:36,017
That isn't a problem.

50
00:09:36,057 --> 00:09:40,737
In the 10 days I've been here
he's brought me only to your clinic.

51
00:09:42,137 --> 00:09:43,217
So, how is KL?

52
00:09:44,057 --> 00:09:45,697
How do you like your new job?

53
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:47,337
I joined work last week.

54
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:50,417
I haven't had
such friendly chats with colleagues yet.

55
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:51,337
But, I'm sure I will.

56
00:09:51,377 --> 00:09:52,777
They've given you
a guesthouse. Right?

57
00:09:52,817 --> 00:09:55,257
The guesthouse is amazing.
You should drop in some time.

58
00:09:55,297 --> 00:09:57,217
It's a very nice place.
Isn't it?

59
00:09:57,817 --> 00:10:00,857
Yes, doctor. It's a very nice place.
Do come home.

60
00:10:00,937 --> 00:10:01,777
Sure.

61
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:04,417
So, do you have
any specific dates in mind?

62
00:10:04,457 --> 00:10:05,617
We can fix it.

63
00:10:05,697 --> 00:10:07,097
You know it. Right?

64
00:10:07,617 --> 00:10:09,097
Any auspicious dates in mind?

65
00:10:09,137 --> 00:10:10,657
No, doctor.
Let it be natural.

66
00:10:10,697 --> 00:10:12,097
Good. That's better.

67
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:15,897
So, until your next visit
be responsible and take care of your girl.

68
00:10:15,937 --> 00:10:17,497
Both the girls, Vasu.

69
00:10:18,057 --> 00:10:19,537
- See you then.
- Sure.

70
00:10:22,577 --> 00:10:24,217
Thank you.
Take care of yourself.

71
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:25,337
Thank you

72
00:10:26,177 --> 00:10:28,057
You seem to be
very friendly with the doctor.

73
00:10:28,137 --> 00:10:30,057
How many times
have you been here by yourself?

74
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:32,737
I was just being nice
to get the image quickly.

75
00:10:32,777 --> 00:10:35,017
She would've given it
even without the flirting.

76
00:10:35,537 --> 00:10:37,337
The car is here.
Let's go.

77
00:10:48,617 --> 00:10:50,377
Are we off to see
the Twin Towers now?

78
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:53,497
In about a month
the three of us can see it together.

79
00:10:58,817 --> 00:11:03,417
"You're all that I need,
for nothing more I pray."

80
00:11:03,777 --> 00:11:08,697
"Dearest, I'll keep you
safe, come what may."

81
00:11:08,777 --> 00:11:17,257
"Every moment in your presence
envelopes me with joy and fragrance."

82
00:11:17,337 --> 00:11:22,297
"Even as I see you a
thousand times every day"

83
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:27,177
"My heart yearns for
more, I have no say."

84
00:11:30,537 --> 00:11:41,297
"My beloved wife,
you are my very life."

85
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:53,177
"The magic in your mesmerising eyes,
change the hues of my days and nights."

86
00:11:53,217 --> 00:11:58,017
"Life is short, my dear."

87
00:11:58,097 --> 00:12:01,857
"Let's live it to the fullest,
with love and cheer."

88
00:12:01,897 --> 00:12:06,817
"Even if the earth splits into pieces,"

89
00:12:07,057 --> 00:12:11,497
"I'll keep you safe till
every worry ceases."

90
00:12:12,497 --> 00:12:22,297
"Dear beloved wife
you are the fragrance in my life."

91
00:12:22,457 --> 00:12:33,137
"My beloved wife,
you are my very life."

92
00:12:45,257 --> 00:12:50,137
"When you walk,
a shadow you won't cast."

93
00:12:50,177 --> 00:12:55,057
"I'll take that in,
no darkness will get past."

94
00:12:55,177 --> 00:13:03,777
"No harm will come your way ever.
Your face will wilt in sadness never."

95
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:08,577
"I will always lookout for you."

96
00:13:08,617 --> 00:13:14,097
"There is nothing I have
to look for beyond you."

97
00:13:14,457 --> 00:13:24,337
"Dear beloved wife
you are the fragrance in my life."

98
00:13:24,377 --> 00:13:34,937
"My beloved wife,
you are my very life."

99
00:13:51,577 --> 00:13:54,297
We've finally settled down.
Do you like this?

100
00:13:55,217 --> 00:13:57,217
That's why I married you.

101
00:13:57,257 --> 00:13:59,137
I meant the house.

102
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:00,777
- Hey, sorry.
- It's Ok.

103
00:14:00,977 --> 00:14:02,537
Sit down.
Where are you going?

104
00:14:02,617 --> 00:14:04,097
I'm feeling hungry.

105
00:14:04,337 --> 00:14:05,577
But, you just ate.

106
00:14:05,657 --> 00:14:07,497
That was your daughter.
She ate her fill.

107
00:14:07,537 --> 00:14:08,937
Now I am hungry.

108
00:14:08,977 --> 00:14:10,537
Can I bring you milk?
I have to be at work.

109
00:14:10,577 --> 00:14:11,817
Don't bother.
I'll manage.

110
00:14:11,857 --> 00:14:12,817
Why?

111
00:14:12,937 --> 00:14:14,617
Who will do it after you leave?

112
00:14:14,657 --> 00:14:16,537
When I'm around
I will do it

113
00:14:17,377 --> 00:14:18,657
And when you aren't around?

114
00:14:18,697 --> 00:14:20,497
That's why
I go for a night shift.

115
00:14:21,177 --> 00:14:22,857
What about the nights?

116
00:14:23,177 --> 00:14:25,297
Who'll take care
of your daughter then?

117
00:14:25,737 --> 00:14:27,217
You'll do the job.

118
00:14:27,857 --> 00:14:30,377
I'm here for your daughter.
For me then?

119
00:14:33,857 --> 00:14:37,257
I'll be at work,
but, I'll be thinking of you all the time.

120
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:39,737
Nonsense. What can I do
with thoughts?

121
00:14:39,777 --> 00:14:41,497
Movie-like dialogues!

122
00:14:41,537 --> 00:14:43,657
I work night shifts
when both of you are asleep.

123
00:14:43,697 --> 00:14:45,497
I'm back
before you wake up.

124
00:14:45,537 --> 00:14:47,697
As if she allows
me to sleep at nights.

125
00:14:52,777 --> 00:14:54,297
I'm a little scared, Vasu.

126
00:14:54,337 --> 00:14:57,297
As the doctor said
wish I had someone here.

127
00:14:57,657 --> 00:15:01,137
Who do we have?
I will have to apply for leave.

128
00:15:01,337 --> 00:15:03,137
I've just joined work,
you understand, don't you?

129
00:15:03,177 --> 00:15:04,737
Don't you understand

130
00:15:05,057 --> 00:15:07,297
That being alone at nights
is difficult for me.

131
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:09,377
What should we do?

132
00:15:09,417 --> 00:15:11,817
Seriously, should I ask for leave?
For two months?

133
00:15:11,857 --> 00:15:14,137
- That's a stupid idea.
- What then?

134
00:15:23,697 --> 00:15:25,297
Shall we call my mum?

135
00:15:25,897 --> 00:15:27,017
Go ahead.

136
00:15:29,537 --> 00:15:32,577
I must leave for work now.
I'll try and come back soon.

137
00:15:34,337 --> 00:15:35,337
What is it?

138
00:15:36,617 --> 00:15:37,657
Nothing.

139
00:15:38,817 --> 00:15:40,577
Didn't I tell you
to call your mum.

140
00:15:41,177 --> 00:15:43,257
It won't be right
for me to make the call.

141
00:15:43,937 --> 00:15:45,417
It'll be the same for me.

142
00:15:45,497 --> 00:15:47,057
So, you won't talk to her.

143
00:15:47,857 --> 00:15:49,097
I'll talk.

144
00:15:49,137 --> 00:15:51,217
I want our loved ones with us.
You know me.

145
00:15:51,337 --> 00:15:52,777
Will she talk to me?

146
00:15:53,457 --> 00:15:54,937
So, you are still angry?

147
00:15:56,137 --> 00:15:58,897
Please Aatirah.
Can we talk after I am back?

148
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:02,217
The supervisor
gets angry if I'm late.

149
00:16:03,857 --> 00:16:05,377
I'll go to the office
and I'll see.

150
00:16:05,457 --> 00:16:06,897
I'll give her a call.

151
00:16:08,817 --> 00:16:09,817
Bye.

152
00:16:58,377 --> 00:17:00,697
It's you.
I thought it was the doctor.

153
00:17:00,777 --> 00:17:01,777
I'm one too.

154
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:03,177
Where is your doctor?

155
00:17:03,497 --> 00:17:05,057
He's gone to the Pediatric ward.

156
00:17:05,097 --> 00:17:05,897
He'll be back soon.

157
00:17:05,937 --> 00:17:08,057
If he asks for me
tell him I left.

158
00:17:08,097 --> 00:17:11,177
Isn't it wrong to take these outside
and run your private clinic?

159
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,817
I agree it's wrong.

160
00:17:12,857 --> 00:17:15,777
The poor folks near my home
keep falling sick...

161
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:16,777
if we can't help them...

162
00:17:16,817 --> 00:17:18,657
what's the point in having
studied Medicine?

163
00:17:18,697 --> 00:17:20,257
What did you say?
Medicine...

164
00:17:20,337 --> 00:17:22,737
You are making
one mistake after another, sister.

165
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:26,457
Don't call me sister.
Call me Kumudha.

166
00:17:32,057 --> 00:17:34,137
Who is this?
I don't see a name.

167
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,417
That's the accident case in bed three.
Injury in the head and abdomen.

168
00:17:38,497 --> 00:17:41,337
He's been sutured
and is sedated. Monitor him.

169
00:17:42,217 --> 00:17:43,617
Police?

170
00:17:43,857 --> 00:17:46,017
The police brought him here.

171
00:17:46,097 --> 00:17:48,777
We have to give them a call
when he wakes up. Don't forget.

172
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:49,937
Okay

173
00:17:50,257 --> 00:17:52,097
My phone doesn't work here.

174
00:17:52,777 --> 00:17:57,297
There's no network coverage here.
It's fairly good in that corner.

175
00:18:26,337 --> 00:18:27,457
Where is she?

176
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:28,457
Doctor?

177
00:18:28,577 --> 00:18:30,297
- Where is Kumudha?
- She left.

178
00:18:30,337 --> 00:18:32,737
How can she leave
without informing me?

179
00:18:32,777 --> 00:18:34,617
She said
her duty hours were over.

180
00:18:34,657 --> 00:18:36,057
She has to inform me.

181
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,217
How can I supervise
all the wards?

182
00:18:39,257 --> 00:18:40,617
Do I have 10 hands?

183
00:18:41,377 --> 00:18:43,337
- What?
- Nothing.

184
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,297
You too will have to inform me
before you leave.

185
00:18:45,337 --> 00:18:46,697
You can't just leave.

186
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:56,817
Doctor

187
00:19:58,457 --> 00:19:59,457
Hello!

188
00:21:06,137 --> 00:21:07,377
Hey, move.

189
00:21:11,697 --> 00:21:13,137
He was gasping for breath.
I was trying to...

190
00:21:13,177 --> 00:21:14,057
What?

191
00:21:14,097 --> 00:21:16,497
You have to send for me.
You shouldn't be doing this.

192
00:21:16,537 --> 00:21:18,017
I'll be answerable.

193
00:21:18,097 --> 00:21:19,857
No one will question you.

194
00:21:26,937 --> 00:21:30,697
He was wearing a white coat.
So I thought he was a doctor.

195
00:21:30,817 --> 00:21:31,937
Okay!

196
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:35,537
Can you
tell us more about him?

197
00:21:35,737 --> 00:21:37,097
I didn't pay attention.

198
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:40,817
He was gasping for breath.
I was taking care of that.

199
00:21:40,857 --> 00:21:44,697
I followed him to the corridor.
But he was gone by then.

200
00:21:45,057 --> 00:21:46,217
Anything about him?

201
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:50,617
No. It was a bike accident.
No IDs on him.

202
00:21:50,777 --> 00:21:52,417
The traffic police
brought him in.

203
00:21:53,497 --> 00:21:54,537
How is he now?

204
00:21:54,577 --> 00:21:57,537
Concussion, contusion and
deep cut on the abdomen.

205
00:21:58,257 --> 00:22:00,697
It's a head injury.
He is unconscious.

206
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:02,097
There is a cut on the abdomen.

207
00:22:02,177 --> 00:22:03,297
A knife wound?

208
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,457
I'm not sure.
It could be because of the accident too.

209
00:22:06,937 --> 00:22:10,097
Wouldn't you know
the difference, doctor?

210
00:22:10,577 --> 00:22:13,697
It's a deep cut.
I can't say much now.

211
00:22:13,937 --> 00:22:16,217
We have to
examine him more on that angle.

212
00:22:16,897 --> 00:22:19,337
When will he wake up?
We need to question him.

213
00:22:19,457 --> 00:22:22,897
We've stopped sedation.
He should be up in a few hours.

214
00:22:23,777 --> 00:22:25,617
- Fingerprint images?
- Yes.

215
00:22:25,937 --> 00:22:28,337
Navin, post our person
as guard here...

216
00:22:28,377 --> 00:22:29,977
to inform us
as soon as he's up.

217
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:30,977
Sure.

218
00:22:32,377 --> 00:22:34,857
Elvin, stay here.
Keep me informed.

219
00:22:34,897 --> 00:22:36,017
Yes, sir.

220
00:22:36,497 --> 00:22:37,977
This is my number.

221
00:22:38,017 --> 00:22:40,617
If you happen to
recollect anything about that person...

222
00:22:40,657 --> 00:22:42,577
- feel free to call me.
- Ok.

223
00:22:42,617 --> 00:22:43,777
- Navin
- Okay, sir

224
00:22:43,857 --> 00:22:45,097
You come along with me.

225
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:53,177
Don't attend to the patient
without my permission. Understand?

226
00:22:53,217 --> 00:22:54,097
I can understand

227
00:22:54,137 --> 00:22:57,537
Even if the patient is in danger,
I should wait for you. Right?

228
00:22:57,577 --> 00:23:01,857
Don't be smart.
Remember, you're not on our rolls yet.

229
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:03,497
And I get to decide that.

230
00:23:03,577 --> 00:23:06,057
Until then
I'm responsible for everything here.

231
00:23:06,777 --> 00:23:08,817
You're done for the day.
You can leave now.

232
00:24:57,937 --> 00:24:59,697
You should have woken me up.

233
00:25:00,697 --> 00:25:01,777
Go and sit down.

234
00:25:01,857 --> 00:25:02,817
I won't.

235
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:05,937
- Aatirah...
- Please go.

236
00:25:16,177 --> 00:25:18,737
You want to know
what happened at work today?

237
00:25:22,297 --> 00:25:23,377
Go on.

238
00:25:23,977 --> 00:25:28,017
I was the hero of the day.
I prevented a serious incident.

239
00:25:28,337 --> 00:25:30,577
Someone tried to kill a patient.

240
00:25:31,137 --> 00:25:32,857
He was unconscious.

241
00:25:33,017 --> 00:25:35,577
If not for me,
he would be dead now.

242
00:25:36,657 --> 00:25:39,617
The police came to investigate.

243
00:25:39,977 --> 00:25:41,257
It was like a scene
out of the movies.

244
00:25:41,297 --> 00:25:42,937
So, you didn't call my mum.

245
00:25:43,137 --> 00:25:44,417
Who is that, Vasu?

246
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,817
Vasu

247
00:25:52,297 --> 00:25:53,417
Vasu

248
00:25:55,017 --> 00:25:56,257
Who are you?

249
00:25:58,017 --> 00:25:59,137
Vasu

250
00:25:59,537 --> 00:26:00,817
Vasu

251
00:26:24,377 --> 00:26:25,017
Vasu

252
00:26:25,057 --> 00:26:25,977
Aatirah

253
00:26:26,057 --> 00:26:26,817
'Talk.'

254
00:26:26,897 --> 00:26:29,057
'What happened?
What did you do?'

255
00:26:29,097 --> 00:26:31,217
I did nothing.
Where are you?

256
00:26:32,297 --> 00:26:33,537
- Vasu
- Aatirah

257
00:26:33,577 --> 00:26:35,057
'Listen to me, doctor.'

258
00:26:35,097 --> 00:26:36,337
- Who are you?
- 'Calm down.'

259
00:26:36,377 --> 00:26:38,857
'The patient you saved last night.
Bed number 305.'

260
00:26:38,937 --> 00:26:40,817
'You have to get him out.
Nobody should know.'

261
00:26:40,857 --> 00:26:42,337
How can I do that?

262
00:26:42,377 --> 00:26:43,137
Vasu

263
00:26:43,177 --> 00:26:43,857
Aatirah

264
00:26:43,897 --> 00:26:44,857
Please stop it.

265
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,497
- What should I do?
- 'I just told you.'

266
00:26:46,577 --> 00:26:49,697
'You have to bring him out.
If the police get to know, she'll be dead.'

267
00:26:49,737 --> 00:26:51,457
Stop it.
Please.

268
00:26:51,497 --> 00:26:52,297
I'll do it.

269
00:26:52,337 --> 00:26:54,377
'The next time I call,
you should be out with him.'

270
00:26:54,417 --> 00:26:56,497
'You have three hours
to do this.'

271
00:26:56,937 --> 00:26:58,057
Hello!

272
00:27:45,017 --> 00:27:46,417
There is undue pressure
from the higher-ups.

273
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:47,977
Close the case quickly.

274
00:27:49,177 --> 00:27:52,337
It's a very big case now.
A lot of big-wigs are involved.

275
00:27:52,457 --> 00:27:55,777
Gather all the evidence.
The Press is full-on following us.

276
00:27:55,937 --> 00:27:59,097
So get all the evidence
and details as soon as possible.

277
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,457
Keep me informed.

278
00:28:01,057 --> 00:28:03,337
- Call me if need be.
- Sure, sir.

279
00:28:09,217 --> 00:28:10,617
Good morning, madam.

280
00:28:12,937 --> 00:28:14,537
Why was
our Chief with Vincent?

281
00:28:14,577 --> 00:28:16,777
Vincent is handling
the Tower murder case.

282
00:28:17,897 --> 00:28:18,937
Get to work.

283
00:28:18,977 --> 00:28:20,897
Have the fingerprints
been screened?

284
00:28:20,937 --> 00:28:22,537
I'll do it right away.

285
00:28:23,057 --> 00:28:25,097
Do it immediately.
I want it right away.

286
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:26,177
Sure.

287
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:35,657
Why do all the big cases
go to Vincent?

288
00:28:35,977 --> 00:28:40,537
He is well-connected,
will go to any extent to solve a case.

289
00:28:40,577 --> 00:28:44,017
Our Chief would never agree to do
the kind of things he does.

290
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:46,497
- So, is it wrong to follow procedures?
- Maybe.

291
00:28:46,577 --> 00:28:48,497
The Chief is under immense pressure...

292
00:28:48,537 --> 00:28:50,457
to solve the case
within 24 hours.

293
00:28:50,497 --> 00:28:51,457
So?

294
00:28:51,537 --> 00:28:53,497
So...
Let's do our work now.

295
00:28:54,617 --> 00:28:55,657
Go on.

296
00:29:02,857 --> 00:29:05,377
Search the criminal files too.
You'll never know.

297
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:34,577
'When I ask you to come here,
you have to.'

298
00:30:34,617 --> 00:30:36,937
I can't help you otherwise.

299
00:30:39,857 --> 00:30:40,977
Listen to me

300
00:30:41,897 --> 00:30:43,017
I understand

301
00:30:43,537 --> 00:30:45,417
The information is correct.

302
00:30:46,537 --> 00:30:49,257
But you have to be here.

303
00:30:53,497 --> 00:30:55,017
I'll call back.

304
00:31:01,617 --> 00:31:03,257
I need to take him
for an X-ray.

305
00:31:14,417 --> 00:31:16,457
Madam, we've got something.

306
00:31:27,857 --> 00:31:29,017
No. I will manage.

307
00:31:29,057 --> 00:31:30,537
I have to be with him.

308
00:31:34,817 --> 00:31:36,097
'So what have we got on him?'

309
00:31:36,137 --> 00:31:40,777
His name is KK.
He has several aliases.

310
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:42,457
The last used alias was KK.

311
00:31:42,497 --> 00:31:43,177
What's KK?

312
00:31:43,217 --> 00:31:44,297
It just says KK.

313
00:31:44,337 --> 00:31:47,817
Could be Karthikeyan, Kumaran,
Kevin, Kabir, Kennedy...

314
00:31:47,897 --> 00:31:50,177
It just says KK.
The crime list is long.

315
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:53,497
Which floor?

316
00:31:54,377 --> 00:31:55,817
Twelfth floor.

317
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:08,137
Alert our guard.
Restrict all movement till we get there.

318
00:32:13,377 --> 00:32:14,657
What happened?

319
00:32:15,337 --> 00:32:16,697
Nothing.

320
00:32:22,297 --> 00:32:24,297
I banged my head on the door.

321
00:32:30,177 --> 00:32:31,177
Hello!

322
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:34,017
Taking him for an X-ray.

323
00:32:40,577 --> 00:32:41,697
Ok.

324
00:32:44,057 --> 00:32:45,497
We have to go down.

325
00:32:46,577 --> 00:32:47,777
Back to the ward.

326
00:33:26,057 --> 00:33:27,817
Charged for
kidnapping, robbery, theft.

327
00:33:27,857 --> 00:33:30,617
Has been a suspect.
But never convicted.

328
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,337
Charges never proven.

329
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:33,617
Very intelligent.

330
00:33:33,697 --> 00:33:35,777
He served five years
in prison...

331
00:33:35,817 --> 00:33:38,897
for attacking a police
vehicle carrying arms.

332
00:33:39,377 --> 00:33:41,177
He is back in business now.

333
00:33:41,217 --> 00:33:43,337
He has strong connections
with gangsters and thugs.

334
00:33:43,417 --> 00:33:45,377
He is in high demand.

335
00:33:45,697 --> 00:33:47,657
He used these connections
for his job too.

336
00:33:47,697 --> 00:33:48,617
What job?

337
00:33:48,657 --> 00:33:51,217
Yes. The surprise is that
he was trained under our own STAGG.

338
00:33:51,297 --> 00:33:53,537
He was one of our
best commandos.

339
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:11,497
He was undercover for some time.

340
00:34:11,577 --> 00:34:13,177
He turned
into a double agent.

341
00:34:13,257 --> 00:34:14,097
A double agent?

342
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:15,617
Yes.
The records say so.

343
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,777
He is an expert
in breaking into safes.

344
00:34:17,857 --> 00:34:19,697
He is wanted
by the Penang Police also.

345
00:34:19,737 --> 00:34:21,817
He has surfaced
after all these years.

346
00:34:21,857 --> 00:34:23,097
Don't know for what.

347
00:34:23,297 --> 00:34:25,057
That sounds very dangerous.

348
00:35:03,817 --> 00:35:06,457
This is one
in Vincent's list of unsolved cases.

349
00:35:06,937 --> 00:35:08,017
Yes

350
00:35:08,057 --> 00:35:10,857
If Vincent couldn't do it,
we must do it.

351
00:35:27,777 --> 00:35:28,937
What is that injection?

352
00:35:28,977 --> 00:35:30,377
Epinehrine...
Adrenaline.

353
00:35:30,457 --> 00:35:31,097
Adrenaline shot.

354
00:35:31,177 --> 00:35:32,017
Who are you?

355
00:35:32,057 --> 00:35:33,497
I'm a doctor.

356
00:35:34,417 --> 00:35:35,777
Where are we?

357
00:35:37,017 --> 00:35:38,497
In a hospital.

358
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:47,497
Let's go.

359
00:35:48,497 --> 00:35:50,657
I know nothing about you.

360
00:35:50,697 --> 00:35:54,817
They've kidnapped my wife
and want me to get you out of here.

361
00:35:55,817 --> 00:35:58,577
Stay calm and come with me.
Let's get out of here.

362
00:35:59,137 --> 00:36:00,857
Put on those clothes.

363
00:36:30,057 --> 00:36:31,097
Vasu

364
00:36:56,177 --> 00:36:57,297
Move.

365
00:37:24,137 --> 00:37:25,217
Park the car.

366
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:33,857
What's your number?

367
00:37:33,937 --> 00:37:35,377
- What?
- Sorry.

368
00:37:37,177 --> 00:37:39,617
- The doctor's number?
- Which doctor?

369
00:37:40,497 --> 00:37:42,257
- Any doctor.
- What?

370
00:37:42,337 --> 00:37:43,617
Do you know Suresh?

371
00:37:43,657 --> 00:37:44,817
Suresh?

372
00:37:44,977 --> 00:37:46,977
- Let me check.
- Okay

373
00:37:52,977 --> 00:37:54,177
Ambulance.

374
00:38:01,017 --> 00:38:02,017
Bus.

375
00:38:15,217 --> 00:38:16,057
Where is he?

376
00:38:16,097 --> 00:38:17,137
Took him for an X-ray.

377
00:38:17,217 --> 00:38:18,097
He's not answering the phone.

378
00:38:18,137 --> 00:38:19,137
Search for them.

379
00:38:19,217 --> 00:38:20,337
Damn it

380
00:38:57,777 --> 00:38:59,217
- Are you Ok?
- Yes.

381
00:38:59,777 --> 00:39:02,377
So, you don't remember
anything that happened.

382
00:39:03,857 --> 00:39:05,097
Next camera.

383
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:07,297
They go up to the twelfth floor.

384
00:39:07,377 --> 00:39:10,537
Since there is renovation happening
there are no cameras up there.

385
00:39:20,377 --> 00:39:21,537
Wow!

386
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:28,337
He escaped right under your nose.
That's too bad.

387
00:39:29,217 --> 00:39:31,057
What are you doing here, Vincent?

388
00:39:31,217 --> 00:39:32,737
I should be asking you that.

389
00:39:32,777 --> 00:39:34,577
What are you doing here?

390
00:39:35,097 --> 00:39:37,737
This is an important case.

391
00:39:38,137 --> 00:39:39,857
Hey, what?

392
00:39:40,217 --> 00:39:41,937
Why are you getting angry?

393
00:39:42,657 --> 00:39:44,377
It's an order
from the higher-ups.

394
00:39:44,497 --> 00:39:49,377
They think he is a suspect
in the industrialist's murder.

395
00:39:51,137 --> 00:39:53,977
This case isn't about
some silly domestic quarrel.

396
00:39:54,097 --> 00:39:55,617
So, you can leave.

397
00:39:55,817 --> 00:39:57,457
This is a prima facie case
of robbery.

398
00:39:57,497 --> 00:40:00,057
This fellow
has assaulted my officer.

399
00:40:00,377 --> 00:40:03,217
So, both the cases are mine.

400
00:40:05,337 --> 00:40:06,417
Let's go.

401
00:40:07,137 --> 00:40:08,137
Move.

402
00:40:10,817 --> 00:40:11,977
Play it.

403
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:44,097
Hello!

404
00:40:44,177 --> 00:40:45,057
'What happened?'

405
00:40:45,097 --> 00:40:46,777
- We've got out.
- 'Where is he?'

406
00:40:47,217 --> 00:40:48,457
He is with me.

407
00:40:51,097 --> 00:40:52,497
Where are you?

408
00:40:52,657 --> 00:40:54,777
Old Harbour.
At our usual place, brother.

409
00:40:55,057 --> 00:40:57,057
What is Anand Makaio saying?

410
00:41:00,217 --> 00:41:01,657
He wants to meet you.

411
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,857
You stay there.
I'll come over.

412
00:41:06,457 --> 00:41:07,737
Where is my wife?

413
00:41:09,737 --> 00:41:11,697
Don't worry.
She's safe.

414
00:41:12,257 --> 00:41:14,137
Go home.
She'll be back in the evening.

415
00:41:14,177 --> 00:41:16,137
- Evening?
- Yes

416
00:41:18,817 --> 00:41:21,537
Stop.
What's going on?

417
00:41:22,337 --> 00:41:24,497
Tell them to fetch
her right away.

418
00:41:25,217 --> 00:41:27,457
I can't wait.
Tell them to come now...

419
00:41:27,497 --> 00:41:29,057
to a crowded place.

420
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:31,897
Tell them
to come to the Metro station.

421
00:41:50,817 --> 00:41:53,777
Gunfire at a bus station.
The two who escaped from here.

422
00:42:00,057 --> 00:42:02,337
We've to get there
before Vincent and gang.

423
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,777
Tell our person
in the Criminal Records Section...

424
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:07,177
to pull out all information
about KK and that doctor.

425
00:42:07,217 --> 00:42:08,257
Ok.

426
00:42:22,377 --> 00:42:23,457
Where are you?

427
00:42:23,497 --> 00:42:24,817
We've reached.

428
00:42:30,497 --> 00:42:33,177
I see you.
I'm coming.

429
00:42:34,697 --> 00:42:35,737
Let's go.

430
00:42:44,457 --> 00:42:45,657
Wait.

431
00:42:46,737 --> 00:42:47,977
- Aatirah
- Wait

432
00:42:48,457 --> 00:42:49,137
Vasu

433
00:42:49,177 --> 00:42:50,337
Let me go.

434
00:42:50,417 --> 00:42:51,777
Who are those people?

435
00:42:52,817 --> 00:42:54,057
Tell him to come back.

436
00:42:54,257 --> 00:42:55,217
Its me

437
00:42:55,497 --> 00:42:56,497
Yes, brother.

438
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,657
Let's meet at our usual spot
in Port Klang tonight.

439
00:42:58,697 --> 00:42:59,497
Ok, brother.

440
00:42:59,537 --> 00:43:01,577
I can't wait until tonight.
Bring her right now.

441
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:04,497
If we don't leave now
they'll kill us all.

442
00:43:04,537 --> 00:43:05,577
Ask them
to come back now.

443
00:43:05,617 --> 00:43:06,937
Put that away.

444
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:09,457
We have to be alive
to see your wife alive.

445
00:43:09,497 --> 00:43:10,697
Let's go, come.

446
00:43:14,777 --> 00:43:15,777
This way.

447
00:43:48,217 --> 00:43:49,617
Let's get away from here.

448
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:56,137
The sutures have given way.

449
00:43:58,097 --> 00:44:00,217
Let's fix this first.

450
00:44:00,257 --> 00:44:02,897
Take me to Aatirah.
I'll do whatever you want after that.

451
00:44:02,937 --> 00:44:04,657
Which place in the harbour?

452
00:44:04,697 --> 00:44:07,177
The flour factory
at the old harbour.

453
00:44:07,497 --> 00:44:10,337
- This won't hold until then.
- Take me to my wife first.

454
00:44:11,937 --> 00:44:14,017
Put that away.

455
00:44:14,657 --> 00:44:16,417
Your priority is to save me.

456
00:44:17,177 --> 00:44:20,497
I would do that
if I were you.

457
00:44:31,897 --> 00:44:34,817
Drive.
I'll tell you where to go.

458
00:45:05,217 --> 00:45:05,857
Was it him?

459
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:09,377
He didn't shoot.
It was the other person.

460
00:45:09,417 --> 00:45:11,897
- It wasn't him?
- No.

461
00:45:12,017 --> 00:45:14,297
If we need more information
you have to come to the police station.

462
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:15,697
Ok.

463
00:45:17,417 --> 00:45:19,297
So, the doctor fired the gun.

464
00:45:19,737 --> 00:45:22,057
So, the doctor took KK hostage.

465
00:45:22,857 --> 00:45:24,897
That doctor has abducted KK.

466
00:45:26,137 --> 00:45:28,857
What do you make of that?
I don't get it, mam.

467
00:45:35,457 --> 00:45:36,777
- Tell me.
- Nothing.

468
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:39,377
The doctor doesn't have
a criminal record.

469
00:45:39,497 --> 00:45:42,257
He came with his wife to KL
just 10 days back.

470
00:45:42,457 --> 00:45:43,897
No records on her too.

471
00:45:44,417 --> 00:45:46,057
Nandha.
Age 26.

472
00:45:46,617 --> 00:45:48,417
He was with KK
in prison.

473
00:45:48,937 --> 00:45:51,457
He was released
the same time as KK.

474
00:45:51,497 --> 00:45:53,057
Now he is KK's partner.

475
00:45:53,377 --> 00:45:56,777
Start an inquiry.
Talk to the neighbours, colleagues.

476
00:45:57,617 --> 00:46:00,177
And talk to my source.
Let's see if we get any information.

477
00:46:00,217 --> 00:46:01,257
Sure!

478
00:46:07,177 --> 00:46:10,217
Pass to me

479
00:46:10,377 --> 00:46:14,657
Pass the ball

480
00:46:43,497 --> 00:46:44,697
Get the key.

481
00:47:12,897 --> 00:47:14,497
Where's the First Aid kit?

482
00:47:48,337 --> 00:47:51,417
If you stay quiet
I don't have to tie you up. Understood?

483
00:48:26,137 --> 00:48:27,497
Kill him.

484
00:48:51,777 --> 00:48:52,617
It's done.

485
00:49:06,017 --> 00:49:07,377
Stop.
Where are you going?

486
00:49:07,457 --> 00:49:10,217
I smell of the hospital.
Need to take a shower.

487
00:49:17,937 --> 00:49:19,177
Keep the door open.

488
00:49:50,217 --> 00:49:52,617
None of us knew
this about Vasu.

489
00:49:53,257 --> 00:49:56,537
Is this a kidnap for ransom?
How are they connected?

490
00:49:56,857 --> 00:49:59,457
They've assaulted a police officer
and stolen his gun.

491
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:01,977
They've attacked the doctor
who tried to help.

492
00:50:02,057 --> 00:50:05,617
They've tried to rob
the cash truck at the shopping mall.

493
00:50:15,777 --> 00:50:19,097
If you spot either of them
the police need to be informed.

494
00:50:19,137 --> 00:50:21,297
Since they have been
identified as terrorists...

495
00:50:21,337 --> 00:50:23,017
you must be cautious.

496
00:50:42,777 --> 00:50:45,657
I don't know him.
If I get to know anything, I'll inform you.

497
00:50:45,697 --> 00:50:46,737
Thank you.

498
00:50:48,377 --> 00:50:49,177
Hello!

499
00:50:49,217 --> 00:50:50,697
Madam, this is Vasu.

500
00:50:50,937 --> 00:50:52,537
The doctor
you're on the lookout for.

501
00:50:53,177 --> 00:50:55,177
I'm in no way
connected to him.

502
00:50:55,457 --> 00:50:57,017
My wife was kidnapped.

503
00:50:57,497 --> 00:51:00,137
They said they'll kill her
if I don't get him out.

504
00:51:00,497 --> 00:51:03,017
I don't know anything more.
I didn't do anything.

505
00:51:03,057 --> 00:51:04,657
Ok. Calm down.

506
00:51:05,017 --> 00:51:06,537
Is he with you now?

507
00:51:06,817 --> 00:51:07,657
Yes.

508
00:51:08,217 --> 00:51:09,217
Where?

509
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:16,817
If you want my help
you have to tell me where you are.

510
00:51:16,857 --> 00:51:18,257
Quick, Vasu.

511
00:51:19,097 --> 00:51:21,857
No.402, Taman Desaria
Block A

512
00:51:21,937 --> 00:51:26,577
We'll come over right away.
Stay there. Do you hear me?

513
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:29,057
Hello?

514
00:51:29,097 --> 00:51:30,177
Ok.

515
00:51:30,217 --> 00:51:31,137
Okay!

516
00:52:04,417 --> 00:52:05,537
No. 402

517
00:52:05,577 --> 00:52:06,537
Block A

518
00:52:06,577 --> 00:52:07,857
Taman Desaria

519
00:52:08,257 --> 00:52:11,617
Don't tell the others.
Vincent's gang in particular.

520
00:52:11,657 --> 00:52:13,777
I'll wait there for you.
Hurry up.

521
00:53:21,457 --> 00:53:22,377
Stay put.

522
00:53:23,017 --> 00:53:26,097
They've kidnapped my wife.
I have nothing to do with him.

523
00:53:26,257 --> 00:53:28,457
You made this a tough chase.

524
00:53:42,617 --> 00:53:45,497
They kidnapped my wife
to get him out of the hospital.

525
00:53:45,817 --> 00:53:47,417
I'm innocent.

526
00:54:08,177 --> 00:54:10,777
What's going on here?

527
00:54:13,177 --> 00:54:13,737
Are you...

528
00:54:13,777 --> 00:54:15,617
You shouldn't have come here.

529
00:54:18,217 --> 00:54:20,697
Let me remind you
This is my case.

530
00:54:21,897 --> 00:54:23,257
Are you Ok?

531
00:54:29,617 --> 00:54:31,297
That belongs to my wife.

532
00:54:31,697 --> 00:54:33,937
They're the ones
who've kidnapped my wife.

533
00:54:38,097 --> 00:54:39,497
Do you know them?

534
00:55:26,937 --> 00:55:28,497
Who let her in here?

535
00:55:28,537 --> 00:55:31,057
I tried stopping her.
But, She came up somehow.

536
00:55:31,097 --> 00:55:32,097
Idiots.

537
00:55:32,897 --> 00:55:35,097
You go and take care of the ground.
I'm coming.

538
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:38,617
Clean it.

539
00:55:40,217 --> 00:55:42,137
I am going to
secure the video.

540
00:55:43,537 --> 00:55:44,937
Finish it...

541
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:47,497
and clean up.

542
00:55:48,057 --> 00:55:50,097
Idiot, put on your jacket.

543
00:56:05,857 --> 00:56:06,457
Hold it.

544
00:56:07,777 --> 00:56:11,137
Hold the gun properly.

545
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:18,137
You shot her down
using this gun.

546
00:56:18,497 --> 00:56:21,297
And I had no choice
but to shoot you both.

547
00:56:22,697 --> 00:56:23,777
What?

548
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:25,577
How does this story sound?

549
00:56:26,137 --> 00:56:27,337
Sounds good?

550
00:56:32,417 --> 00:56:33,937
I have to kill
this guy first.

551
00:56:39,857 --> 00:56:41,137
Check this out.

552
00:56:42,817 --> 00:56:44,297
A bonus.

553
00:56:54,737 --> 00:56:55,937
What else do you have?

554
00:56:59,137 --> 00:57:00,537
Are there more safe houses?

555
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:13,577
You are living
a good life.

556
00:57:15,777 --> 00:57:16,497
Take it.

557
00:57:21,217 --> 00:57:22,417
There is one more.

558
00:57:23,497 --> 00:57:24,457
Just go

559
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:56,977
See if anyone is coming.

560
00:59:03,977 --> 00:59:06,617
Tell me
what's going on here?

561
00:59:06,657 --> 00:59:08,057
Who are you guys?

562
00:59:10,417 --> 00:59:11,297
Speak up.

563
00:59:14,337 --> 00:59:18,897
You'll be the one talking.
The Police will be here any minute.

564
00:59:19,017 --> 00:59:22,377
They'll have questions for you.

565
00:59:24,937 --> 00:59:27,617
If you don't talk
I'll fire the next one into your mouth.

566
00:59:27,937 --> 00:59:29,017
Okay

567
00:59:30,897 --> 00:59:32,977
Okay...okay

568
00:59:33,657 --> 00:59:34,697
Okay

569
00:59:36,257 --> 00:59:38,737
We are from Criminal Investigations.

570
00:59:39,497 --> 00:59:41,257
We are from the same team.

571
00:59:42,737 --> 00:59:43,577
Who is that?

572
00:59:44,977 --> 00:59:46,097
Our officers.

573
00:59:46,817 --> 00:59:48,217
But, from another team.

574
00:59:48,617 --> 00:59:50,417
What are you investigating?

575
00:59:51,417 --> 00:59:53,097
Why are you trying to kill me?

576
00:59:53,497 --> 00:59:56,497
At times we offer extra
services to our clients.

577
00:59:56,537 --> 00:59:57,737
What service?

578
00:59:58,417 --> 00:59:59,457
All kinds.

579
01:00:00,657 --> 01:00:01,897
You'll understand.

580
01:00:02,177 --> 01:00:04,097
How are you connected
to the industrialist?

581
01:00:09,577 --> 01:00:12,217
His son hired us.

582
01:00:14,137 --> 01:00:18,177
He didn't want to
include his son in his Will.

583
01:00:18,777 --> 01:00:21,777
So, we made him
re-write his Will.

584
01:00:27,377 --> 01:00:28,737
His final Will.

585
01:00:44,737 --> 01:00:48,137
Vincent wanted to set up the
case as murder for gain.

586
01:00:49,057 --> 01:00:50,777
So, we asked Anand
Makaio for a person

587
01:00:50,817 --> 01:00:54,217
to break into the
industrialist's safe.

588
01:00:55,297 --> 01:00:56,497
He sent you.

589
01:00:58,937 --> 01:01:00,097
Wait here.

590
01:01:05,977 --> 01:01:11,217
He told you that your case documents
were in the safe and got you there.

591
01:01:25,617 --> 01:01:28,377
So, you'll end up
being the murderer.

592
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:36,257
The plan was
to kill you...

593
01:01:37,457 --> 01:01:40,457
and frame you as the murderer.

594
01:01:42,417 --> 01:01:43,937
But you escaped.

595
01:01:54,057 --> 01:01:56,217
How are Vincent and
Anand Makaio connected?

596
01:01:57,337 --> 01:01:58,497
What video is it?

597
01:01:58,537 --> 01:02:02,257
There was a security
camera in the office.

598
01:02:06,577 --> 01:02:11,537
Since we were investigating the case
we got hold of the video.

599
01:02:12,137 --> 01:02:13,777
We wanted to kill you first and...

600
01:02:13,817 --> 01:02:15,377
later use the video...

601
01:02:15,617 --> 01:02:18,737
to demand money from the
industrialist's son.

602
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:19,817
That was their plan.

603
01:02:19,897 --> 01:02:21,097
Whose plan?

604
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:22,297
Vincent...

605
01:02:23,577 --> 01:02:24,937
and Anand Makaio's.

606
01:02:27,337 --> 01:02:28,417
Where is that video now?

607
01:02:28,457 --> 01:02:30,977
Maybe in a flash drive.

608
01:02:31,217 --> 01:02:32,337
Must be with Vincent.

609
01:02:35,217 --> 01:02:37,377
I swear I don't know
anything else.

610
01:02:37,417 --> 01:02:38,617
Please

611
01:02:38,657 --> 01:02:40,257
How did you
get this address?

612
01:02:46,457 --> 01:02:47,817
The police are here.

613
01:02:49,537 --> 01:02:51,297
KK and the doctor
killed our madam.

614
01:02:51,337 --> 01:02:51,817
What?

615
01:02:51,857 --> 01:02:53,337
KK and the doctor
killed our madam.

616
01:02:53,377 --> 01:02:55,097
They've held
our men hostage.

617
01:02:59,177 --> 01:03:02,617
Anand Makaio is the one...

618
01:03:04,737 --> 01:03:06,937
who wants you dead.

619
01:03:08,017 --> 01:03:12,297
He is on his way to meet
your guy and that girl.

620
01:03:15,217 --> 01:03:17,017
Which girl?

621
01:03:17,657 --> 01:03:19,777
Did you mean my wife?

622
01:03:20,497 --> 01:03:23,057
Where is she being held?

623
01:03:23,097 --> 01:03:25,977
What have you guys done to her?
Tell me.

624
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:27,297
Tell me

625
01:03:27,617 --> 01:03:29,177
Tell me where she is.

626
01:03:29,217 --> 01:03:31,337
Try asking the guys
who are coming up.

627
01:03:31,457 --> 01:03:32,657
Please tell me.

628
01:04:19,257 --> 01:04:20,777
The suspect is on the run...

629
01:04:20,817 --> 01:04:22,697
bike registration number
WBJ 9890.

630
01:04:22,777 --> 01:04:25,337
I repeat.
Follow his bike.

631
01:04:27,057 --> 01:04:28,137
Hurry up.

632
01:04:37,177 --> 01:04:39,457
Don't move.

633
01:04:41,817 --> 01:04:43,377
No. Don't move.

634
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:06,137
They shot us and escaped.

635
01:05:17,817 --> 01:05:19,617
No, idiot

636
01:05:23,137 --> 01:05:24,657
Move

637
01:05:51,617 --> 01:05:53,937
Suspect is on
the Jalan Tun Razak bridge.

638
01:05:53,977 --> 01:05:57,297
I repeat. Suspect has entered
the Jalan Tun Razak bridge.

639
01:07:14,657 --> 01:07:18,417
Come in for control room.
Keep us informed on the status.

640
01:07:19,417 --> 01:07:22,297
Another backup team
is on the way.

641
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:10,337
- Out.
- Hey, who are you?

642
01:08:50,177 --> 01:08:55,537
Block car with
WPD 960 registration.

643
01:10:10,857 --> 01:10:13,777
This is a public place.
Put your gun away, idiot.

644
01:10:41,937 --> 01:10:43,777
Stay where you are.

645
01:10:43,817 --> 01:10:45,177
Step back

646
01:10:45,417 --> 01:10:46,657
Don't come any closer.

647
01:10:47,697 --> 01:10:48,777
I'll kill her.

648
01:10:49,137 --> 01:10:51,577
- Step back.
- You're committing a mistake.

649
01:10:51,617 --> 01:10:53,617
- Step back.
- Okay

650
01:10:53,697 --> 01:10:55,577
- I don't want to do this.
- Leave her

651
01:10:56,137 --> 01:10:58,337
- Don't come any closer.
- Okay

652
01:10:58,417 --> 01:10:59,977
Step back.

653
01:11:06,577 --> 01:11:07,817
Step back.

654
01:11:09,097 --> 01:11:10,137
I'll kill her.

655
01:11:10,217 --> 01:11:11,337
Don't step out.

656
01:11:11,377 --> 01:11:12,817
Step back.

657
01:11:16,897 --> 01:11:21,977
I'm sorry.
Please take care.

658
01:11:22,377 --> 01:11:23,417
Forgive me.

659
01:11:37,577 --> 01:11:42,417
"You're all that I need,
for nothing more I pray."

660
01:11:42,577 --> 01:11:46,777
"Dearest, I'll keep you
safe, come what may."

661
01:11:47,497 --> 01:11:52,337
"No harm will come your way ever."

662
01:11:52,457 --> 01:11:56,097
"Your face will wilt in sadness never."

663
01:11:56,137 --> 01:12:00,937
"I will always lookout for you."

664
01:12:00,977 --> 01:12:07,177
"There is nothing I have
to look for beyond you."

665
01:12:25,297 --> 01:12:26,337
Hey! Who are you?

666
01:12:26,377 --> 01:12:27,497
Shut up.

667
01:12:39,737 --> 01:12:42,937
How many have died?
Answer us.

668
01:13:03,897 --> 01:13:07,057
Have you removed
my fingerprints on that gun?

669
01:13:10,777 --> 01:13:12,337
He attacked
all of a sudden.

670
01:13:12,377 --> 01:13:13,457
Idiot!

671
01:13:17,217 --> 01:13:18,657
Did he ask you about anything?

672
01:13:19,417 --> 01:13:20,457
He didn't.

673
01:13:23,617 --> 01:13:24,897
Sorry.
Not now.

674
01:13:24,937 --> 01:13:26,857
They've killed so many.
We need an answer.

675
01:13:26,897 --> 01:13:28,297
They've killed police officers.
Please comment.

676
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:29,977
Stop. You can't go in.

677
01:13:30,377 --> 01:13:32,017
The case has gone
out of proportion.

678
01:13:32,057 --> 01:13:33,377
Do whatever you need to.

679
01:13:33,417 --> 01:13:36,577
You have to take them both into custody.
Whatever it takes.

680
01:13:36,657 --> 01:13:38,457
Close this today.
- Sir

681
01:13:39,097 --> 01:13:41,377
We were working along
with madam on this case.

682
01:13:41,457 --> 01:13:45,297
She came here because that
doctor had called her.

683
01:13:45,697 --> 01:13:46,937
Sir, if you allow us...

684
01:13:47,257 --> 01:13:50,377
She came here without informing us.
See what happened.

685
01:13:50,617 --> 01:13:53,777
I'd warned you about the case
being too big for your team...

686
01:13:53,817 --> 01:13:55,337
that you can't handle it.

687
01:13:55,977 --> 01:13:57,657
- I warned you, people...
- Vincent

688
01:13:59,697 --> 01:14:01,137
I understand your anger.

689
01:14:02,617 --> 01:14:04,257
Kalpana is my colleague too.

690
01:14:04,297 --> 01:14:06,937
You can't be angry and do this job.
You have to be composed.

691
01:14:07,137 --> 01:14:09,097
Vincent will handle
the case from now.

692
01:14:09,177 --> 01:14:10,377
But, sir...

693
01:14:10,857 --> 01:14:12,537
Police officers
have been murdered.

694
01:14:12,777 --> 01:14:14,337
- Get them quick.
- Sir

695
01:14:14,697 --> 01:14:15,817
If need be...

696
01:14:16,417 --> 01:14:18,537
...don't hesitate
to shoot them.

697
01:14:18,897 --> 01:14:20,857
Sure, sir.
We are on it completely.

698
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,497
Trust me, sir.
We will get them.

699
01:14:36,297 --> 01:14:38,417
I'm done
with this police-robber game.

700
01:14:38,577 --> 01:14:40,497
Alert our men at the harbour.

701
01:14:40,697 --> 01:14:41,897
Talk to Anand Makaio.

702
01:14:42,337 --> 01:14:45,217
Tell him that
when KK calls, he has to inform us.

703
01:14:45,497 --> 01:14:47,697
Don't worry.
Vincent will get them.

704
01:14:49,057 --> 01:14:49,897
Let's go.

705
01:14:50,217 --> 01:14:50,937
No.

706
01:14:52,657 --> 01:14:54,497
I'll drive madam's car.

707
01:15:22,137 --> 01:15:25,337
- Where is Nandha?
- He's right here. Come out.

708
01:15:30,977 --> 01:15:32,377
Stop it.
Just listen to us.

709
01:15:40,417 --> 01:15:44,337
Step out, KK.

710
01:16:56,137 --> 01:16:58,937
Where is Aatirah?
Where is my wife?

711
01:17:24,457 --> 01:17:25,937
Oh God!

712
01:17:32,177 --> 01:17:34,177
Who is this?
Where's my wife?

713
01:17:34,257 --> 01:17:36,697
Didn't he kidnap
Aatirah for you?

714
01:17:36,817 --> 01:17:38,297
What's going on?

715
01:17:41,337 --> 01:17:43,857
I shouldn't have helped you.
It's my fault.

716
01:17:44,097 --> 01:17:46,537
Where have they taken her?
Is she all right?

717
01:17:46,617 --> 01:17:48,257
You better tell me...

718
01:17:50,137 --> 01:17:51,977
Your wife is alive.

719
01:17:56,097 --> 01:17:58,817
How can you be so sure?
Please tell me.

720
01:18:00,777 --> 01:18:03,017
She will be kept alive
till they find us.

721
01:18:10,057 --> 01:18:12,737
Tomorrow, on hearing
the news of her husband's death...

722
01:18:12,857 --> 01:18:18,337
unable to bear the shock she'll jump
out of the window and kill herself.

723
01:18:18,377 --> 01:18:21,657
But, she's pregnant.

724
01:18:25,777 --> 01:18:26,817
So?

725
01:18:32,097 --> 01:18:34,217
We have to get hold of
that video on the pen drive.

726
01:18:34,257 --> 01:18:36,897
That's at the headquarters
and the Police are on the lookout for us.

727
01:18:36,937 --> 01:18:38,457
How can we break in?

728
01:19:02,977 --> 01:19:04,537
Greetings!

729
01:19:08,337 --> 01:19:11,817
Go ahead.
Don't forget us.

730
01:19:11,857 --> 01:19:12,737
Be careful.

731
01:19:12,777 --> 01:19:15,577
"One look at him, do you
break into a cold sweat?"

732
01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:19,137
"Throat's parched
in sheer fright?"

733
01:19:19,177 --> 01:19:21,977
"Up close, he sends a
shiver down your spine."

734
01:19:22,057 --> 01:19:25,217
"No need for eight rounds, bro
I'll take you down in two, let's go."

735
01:19:25,257 --> 01:19:28,137
"The one who wins battles.
The one with strength."

736
01:19:28,177 --> 01:19:31,097
"The one and only.
The one with valour."

737
01:19:31,177 --> 01:19:36,857
"The one who's conquered Kadaram."

738
01:19:37,257 --> 01:19:40,297
"The one who's a cut above.
The one who's valiant."

739
01:19:40,337 --> 01:19:43,097
"The honourable one.
The one who's celebrated."

740
01:19:43,177 --> 01:19:48,417
"The one who's conquered Kadaram."

741
01:19:50,377 --> 01:19:53,977
"Stomp you down, he will.
Shred you to pieces, be careful."

742
01:19:54,017 --> 01:19:56,937
"Dare take him on, he'll smirk.
Your end will lurk."

743
01:19:56,977 --> 01:20:02,857
"Uproot you he can, if he wants to.
The ground will shudder, if he strikes you."

744
01:20:02,937 --> 01:20:05,257
"A lone ranger he is out there."

745
01:20:05,337 --> 01:20:08,897
"His very name will give you the scare.
Try it, see it flare."

746
01:20:08,977 --> 01:20:11,777
"Try it, see it flare."

747
01:20:11,937 --> 01:20:14,897
"No need for eight rounds, bro
I'll take you down in two, let's go."

748
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:17,777
"The one who wins battles.
The one with strength."

749
01:20:17,857 --> 01:20:20,777
"The one and only.
The one with valour."

750
01:20:20,857 --> 01:20:26,377
"The one who's conquered Kadaram."

751
01:20:27,017 --> 01:20:30,017
"The one who's a cut above.
The one who's valiant."

752
01:20:30,097 --> 01:20:32,857
"The honourable one.
The one who's celebrated."

753
01:20:32,897 --> 01:20:38,577
"The one who's conquered Kadaram."

754
01:21:17,377 --> 01:21:22,137
"If you get caught,
you better run fast."

755
01:21:23,297 --> 01:21:28,257
"If he confronts you, it'll be brazen,
even the God of death stands frozen."

756
01:21:29,337 --> 01:21:31,577
"Do you get it?"

757
01:21:32,297 --> 01:21:34,217
"So, move it..."

758
01:21:35,417 --> 01:21:38,337
"The one who wins battles.
The one with strength."

759
01:21:38,377 --> 01:21:41,217
"The one and only.
The one with valour."

760
01:21:41,257 --> 01:21:47,097
"The one who's conquered Kadaram."

761
01:21:47,497 --> 01:21:50,417
"The one who's a cut above.
The one who's valiant."

762
01:21:50,457 --> 01:21:53,137
"The honourable one.
The one who's celebrated."

763
01:21:53,217 --> 01:21:59,777
"The one who's conquered Kadaram."

764
01:22:01,017 --> 01:22:04,377
"No need for eight rounds, bro
I'll take you down in two, let's go."

765
01:22:05,177 --> 01:22:06,737
Come in, my friend.

766
01:22:11,097 --> 01:22:13,897
- I was worried.
- Worried?

767
01:22:14,417 --> 01:22:16,977
About the five men
you sent?

768
01:22:17,697 --> 01:22:19,897
Don't worry.
They are dead.

769
01:22:20,497 --> 01:22:22,017
What do you mean?

770
01:22:22,617 --> 01:22:23,777
Want a drink?

771
01:22:25,257 --> 01:22:26,257
Of course.

772
01:22:31,737 --> 01:22:33,337
- What are you doing?
- Go that side

773
01:22:33,777 --> 01:22:34,937
Stop it.

774
01:22:35,777 --> 01:22:36,937
No

775
01:22:37,417 --> 01:22:40,457
Please don't.
You are making a mistake, friend.

776
01:22:40,617 --> 01:22:43,897
Don't, friend.

777
01:22:44,497 --> 01:22:46,897
You are making a mistake.
Don't, my friend.

778
01:22:46,937 --> 01:22:48,977
- What?
- My friend.

779
01:22:50,617 --> 01:22:52,697
Why did you send
this friend to the Tower?

780
01:22:53,537 --> 01:22:56,097
It was about your old arms robbery case...

781
01:22:56,217 --> 01:22:58,257
Arms robbery...

782
01:22:58,417 --> 01:23:00,137
The details...

783
01:23:00,577 --> 01:23:01,337
What details?

784
01:23:01,377 --> 01:23:03,537
The details recorded
were being kept there.

785
01:23:03,737 --> 01:23:04,857
Was it there?

786
01:23:08,737 --> 01:23:10,017
Was it there?

787
01:23:12,497 --> 01:23:14,097
Yes. It was there.

788
01:23:14,937 --> 01:23:16,697
There was a plan to kill me.

789
01:23:18,097 --> 01:23:19,177
Call now.

790
01:23:19,977 --> 01:23:21,137
Not to me.

791
01:23:21,897 --> 01:23:22,897
Call the God of death.

792
01:23:23,457 --> 01:23:27,057
Don't KK.
I'll pay you as much as you want.

793
01:23:28,457 --> 01:23:30,177
How much for Nandha?

794
01:23:31,977 --> 01:23:33,617
I've stayed quiet for six years.

795
01:23:33,657 --> 01:23:35,657
I've stayed away
from this clean-up work.

796
01:23:36,777 --> 01:23:38,777
But, you've set me up
for another clean-up.

797
01:23:39,377 --> 01:23:41,537
It wasn't me.
Vincent is to blame.

798
01:23:44,097 --> 01:23:45,457
Fine...

799
01:23:46,097 --> 01:23:49,457
- Where is that pen drive?
- In a safe at Vincent's office.

800
01:23:52,497 --> 01:23:53,697
Call him.

801
01:23:54,657 --> 01:23:55,617
Call whom?

802
01:23:55,937 --> 01:23:57,097
Your husband.

803
01:24:12,697 --> 01:24:13,777
Hello

804
01:24:14,097 --> 01:24:17,217
KK called.
They are coming at 10 am...

805
01:24:17,257 --> 01:24:19,337
to collect the passport and money.

806
01:24:19,377 --> 01:24:20,537
'Both of them?'

807
01:24:21,497 --> 01:24:22,737
'Both of them?'

808
01:24:23,137 --> 01:24:23,977
Yes.

809
01:24:25,937 --> 01:24:27,777
I'll get there before them.

810
01:24:28,657 --> 01:24:29,817
'You be safe.'

811
01:24:38,857 --> 01:24:41,217
Let him go.
Let's get out of here.

812
01:24:41,457 --> 01:24:44,897
Not another murder.
Let's get out of here.

813
01:24:45,857 --> 01:24:49,297
We know where the pen drive is.
Let's get out of here.

814
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:22,897
Don't you know
you can't smoke in here.

815
01:25:29,297 --> 01:25:31,257
Vasu didn't do anything wrong.

816
01:25:32,737 --> 01:25:34,897
- My husband didn't do...
- Shut up.

817
01:25:49,297 --> 01:25:57,737
(Reporting on crimes in the city)

818
01:25:57,817 --> 01:26:05,217
(Crime reporting)

819
01:26:09,897 --> 01:26:12,457
'Good morning.
Headlines today.'

820
01:26:12,617 --> 01:26:15,577
'Random incidents of crime
have been reported today.'

821
01:26:15,657 --> 01:26:21,217
'Police suspect criminals from other states
have sneaked in to the city.'

822
01:26:21,297 --> 01:26:26,337
'The director of the International Art show
will be overseeing the event tomorrow.'

823
01:26:26,377 --> 01:26:30,817
'In an important case, we hear that Nandha,
fugitive KK's partner was killed and...

824
01:26:30,857 --> 01:26:33,697
his last rites were performed.

825
01:26:33,737 --> 01:26:36,257
There is a rumour that
Nandha was KK's brother.'

826
01:26:36,297 --> 01:26:43,537
'The police are confident
they'll arrest Dr Vasu and KK soon.'

827
01:27:02,337 --> 01:27:06,617
(overlap of voices)

828
01:27:14,217 --> 01:27:16,137
What's going on?
Are there no lockups?

829
01:27:16,177 --> 01:27:18,377
There's commotion in the city.

830
01:27:18,417 --> 01:27:21,097
- Clear the crowd quickly.
- Ok, sir.

831
01:28:13,537 --> 01:28:16,417
Are you sure about the address?

832
01:28:16,577 --> 01:28:17,537
Sure?

833
01:28:18,217 --> 01:28:19,057
Okay

834
01:28:19,977 --> 01:28:21,177
- I have to go.
- Where to?

835
01:28:21,217 --> 01:28:21,977
Important work is pending.

836
01:28:22,017 --> 01:28:24,257
We have Important work here too.
Stay back.

837
01:28:24,297 --> 01:28:26,177
This is critical.
I have to go.

838
01:28:26,817 --> 01:28:28,857
I don't care.
You better stay here.

839
01:28:28,897 --> 01:28:31,417
I just got a call from
madam's informer.

840
01:28:31,457 --> 01:28:34,177
He confirmed that
KK is Anand Makaio's man.

841
01:28:34,217 --> 01:28:37,257
- KK is not our case anymore.
- I know. So?

842
01:28:38,417 --> 01:28:43,857
I want to beat them to death.
Those unscrupulous fellows killed a cop.

843
01:28:45,497 --> 01:28:48,537
But this isn't our case anymore.
It's Vincent's.

844
01:28:49,137 --> 01:28:52,377
We don't get along with him
and we don't have a Chief.

845
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:53,857
Don't do this.

846
01:28:55,297 --> 01:28:56,897
Get the statement.

847
01:29:01,257 --> 01:29:04,257
- Where is ASP Vincent's office?
- Walk up and take the left.

848
01:29:15,417 --> 01:29:17,257
Are the reports ready?
Send it to all the police stations.

849
01:29:17,297 --> 01:29:20,257
I have to report
to the Chief first.

850
01:29:56,657 --> 01:29:58,857
Which gang?

851
01:30:16,617 --> 01:30:17,697
Run.

852
01:31:12,097 --> 01:31:13,777
Do you want to use the loo?

853
01:31:15,057 --> 01:31:16,217
Come.

854
01:31:27,537 --> 01:31:29,217
I'll go search for Aatirah.

855
01:31:40,337 --> 01:31:41,417
Hey

856
01:31:44,737 --> 01:31:48,137
Don't just pull it out all the time.
It might misfire.

857
01:32:16,537 --> 01:32:17,577
Don't move.

858
01:32:21,337 --> 01:32:22,777
Give way.

859
01:32:23,337 --> 01:32:24,697
Give way

860
01:33:20,617 --> 01:33:25,017
- Please help me. I'm innocent.
- That's what everyone says.

861
01:33:27,777 --> 01:33:30,377
Hurry up.
Take her and go.

862
01:33:32,977 --> 01:33:36,057
Please help me.

863
01:33:37,977 --> 01:33:40,177
Give your NRIC number.

864
01:33:45,777 --> 01:33:49,937
You listen to me first, sir.
Uncuff me and I'll explain to you.

865
01:33:54,617 --> 01:33:55,697
Get back.

866
01:33:55,937 --> 01:33:57,137
Okay

867
01:33:59,417 --> 01:34:00,777
No

868
01:34:02,017 --> 01:34:03,577
No, please leave me

869
01:34:03,657 --> 01:34:04,977
Get up

870
01:34:06,017 --> 01:34:07,617
Shut up.

871
01:34:40,017 --> 01:34:41,217
Don't move.

872
01:34:42,177 --> 01:34:43,097
Okay

873
01:34:43,137 --> 01:34:44,097
Get the cuff.

874
01:34:44,777 --> 01:34:46,137
Get the cuff.

875
01:35:11,337 --> 01:35:13,697
Leave me

876
01:35:14,377 --> 01:35:16,937
Please leave me

877
01:35:59,017 --> 01:36:01,457
Get up.

878
01:36:04,537 --> 01:36:10,177
You idiot,
how dare you attack a policeman?

879
01:36:10,657 --> 01:36:12,177
You are finished.

880
01:36:17,097 --> 01:36:19,497
- Please let me go.
- Shut up.

881
01:36:28,257 --> 01:36:29,297
Get up.

882
01:36:36,457 --> 01:36:38,537
Move on

883
01:36:39,137 --> 01:36:40,417
Move.

884
01:37:02,537 --> 01:37:04,257
Thought you could escape?

885
01:37:07,697 --> 01:37:10,177
I'm going to kill your baby now.

886
01:38:11,937 --> 01:38:13,777
I'm so sorry.

887
01:38:20,777 --> 01:38:22,857
I'm so sorry.

888
01:38:45,777 --> 01:38:47,777
Access granted

889
01:39:07,977 --> 01:39:11,977
I didn't do this.
It was the guy in the photo.

890
01:39:12,057 --> 01:39:13,617
Leave me please.

891
01:39:21,617 --> 01:39:24,897
You can't shoot me and
get away from here.

892
01:39:26,377 --> 01:39:30,377
I didn't kill your brother.
Believe me.

893
01:39:31,457 --> 01:39:35,057
He came in the way,
died trying to save the girl.

894
01:39:39,977 --> 01:39:42,457
Please...
We can have a deal.

895
01:39:44,297 --> 01:39:47,777
I'll give you a share.
What do you say?

896
01:39:51,617 --> 01:39:53,817
You haven't learnt your lesson.

897
01:41:54,817 --> 01:41:57,177
Move. Give way.

898
01:42:07,977 --> 01:42:10,417
The pain is unbearable, Vasu.

899
01:42:10,617 --> 01:42:12,737
What is going on?

900
01:42:12,937 --> 01:42:15,137
I didn't do anything.

901
01:42:47,497 --> 01:42:49,857
Please let me go.

902
01:42:51,457 --> 01:42:53,497
I need to be with her.

903
01:42:54,897 --> 01:42:57,977
Please let me be with her.

904
01:43:10,857 --> 01:43:13,057
- Please let me go.
- Shut up and move.

905
01:43:13,097 --> 01:43:16,297
- I didn't do anything.
- Shut up or I'll kill you.

906
01:43:16,377 --> 01:43:18,057
Stop it, Catherine.

907
01:43:24,777 --> 01:43:25,937
Whose is that?

908
01:43:28,257 --> 01:43:29,657
Where is it?

909
01:43:46,777 --> 01:43:49,937
Sir, they've taken that doctor
to the control room.

910
01:44:13,657 --> 01:44:14,977
This is my case.

911
01:44:17,417 --> 01:44:18,737
I'm going to take him.

912
01:44:18,777 --> 01:44:20,537
No. I don't think so.

913
01:44:56,497 --> 01:45:01,377
"If you get caught,
you better run fast."

914
01:45:02,537 --> 01:45:04,017
"Do you get it?"

915
01:45:05,417 --> 01:45:06,697
"So, move it..."

916
01:45:06,737 --> 01:45:09,697
"The one who wins battles.
The one with strength."

917
01:45:09,737 --> 01:45:12,537
"The one and only.
The one with valour."

918
01:45:12,577 --> 01:45:16,057
"The one who's conquered Kadaram."

919
01:46:21,857 --> 01:46:23,777
What happened?

920
01:46:24,377 --> 01:46:27,097
I tried making a call to your mum.

921
01:46:58,017 --> 01:46:59,817
I'm coming.

922
01:47:00,657 --> 01:47:02,897
I'm coming.

923
01:47:04,657 --> 01:47:05,937
Which class
is your granddaughter in?

924
01:47:05,977 --> 01:47:09,217
- Grandfather, where is my dad?
- Check outside.

925
01:47:11,457 --> 01:47:13,937
- Uncle, where's dad?
- He was right here.

926
01:47:13,977 --> 01:47:15,217
He just went out.

927
01:47:22,297 --> 01:47:24,177
I'm sorry, baby brother.

928
01:47:24,617 --> 01:47:27,137
Baby brother?
Why not a baby sister?

929
01:47:27,177 --> 01:47:29,057
I want both.

930
01:47:31,817 --> 01:47:33,897
Thank you.
See you in the hospital.

931
01:47:34,097 --> 01:47:35,177
Dad!

932
01:47:39,697 --> 01:47:41,017
Bye

933
01:47:41,457 --> 01:47:43,057
Bye...thanks

934
01:47:43,617 --> 01:47:47,497
Dad, the TV upstairs is not working.
We want to watch Shin Chan.

935
01:47:52,897 --> 01:47:54,577
Why're you watching TV now?

936
01:47:55,257 --> 01:47:57,457
- I'm going to ground you.
- Not today.

937
01:47:59,737 --> 01:48:01,217
Have some chocolates.

938
01:48:01,257 --> 01:48:05,177
'Here are on-the-spot live reports
about Vincent's death.'

939
01:48:05,697 --> 01:48:08,817
'Vincent was sentenced
to 16-years imprisonment'

940
01:48:08,857 --> 01:48:11,617
'-in the Industrialist's
murder case.'

941
01:48:11,977 --> 01:48:15,297
'Vincent had applied
for a two-day parole.'

942
01:48:15,337 --> 01:48:17,817
'It was granted on the basis of
his good conduct in prison.'

943
01:48:17,857 --> 01:48:24,057
'He was out after seven years in prison
and checked into this hotel at 8 am.'

944
01:48:24,097 --> 01:48:27,377
'But two hours ago,
he was found dead in the hotel room.'

945
01:48:54,497 --> 01:49:00,297
'He was found dead with a gun in his hand
and a bullet shot in his head.'

946
01:49:00,377 --> 01:49:03,377
'Preliminary investigations
say it is a suicide.'

947
01:49:03,417 --> 01:49:06,217
'But the police are looking
at other angles too.'

948
01:49:06,257 --> 01:49:10,297
'KK who exposed Vincent is still in hiding.
The police are on the lookout for him.'

949
01:49:10,337 --> 01:49:13,297
'Where is KK?
Will the police have an answer?'

950
01:49:44,737 --> 01:49:45,697
Who was it?

951
01:49:53,857 --> 01:49:56,017
Who gave this gift?

952
01:50:01,657 --> 01:50:03,097
Very nice.

953
01:50:15,337 --> 01:50:16,417
Okay

954
01:50:18,937 --> 01:50:20,017
Nothing to worry.

955
01:50:21,577 --> 01:50:22,697
Who was that?

956
01:50:24,897 --> 01:50:25,897
A friend.

957
01:50:26,497 --> 01:50:29,817
- Are you all right?
- Absolutely fine.
