Shit...

Rija?

00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,000
Rija!

00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,900
Rija!

[Rija, outside] Woo!

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,060
Weeoo!

Rija?

13
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,679
Rija, come in.

14
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,960
Rija, come in right now!

15
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,800
Get off the swing!

16
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,940
Rija, I'm not joking. Get off right now!
We're getting late!

17
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,740
Rija!

18
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,200
I wore this yesterday.

19
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,080
I know, I've got to do the laundry.

20
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,820
Do the laundry.

21
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,080
No time, you know how your father gets.

22
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,500
From fighting at school again?

23
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,100
Why don't you listen?

24
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,420
Rija, why is Bobo to blame for all your naughty ideas, huh?

25
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,260
She's fighting at school again.

26
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,240
You didn't see the huge bruise on her arm?

27
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,760
Typical.

28
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,680
Why should I do it?
You go and do it this time!

29
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,620
Because I don't have the time to do it!

30
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,100
I'm the one who had to move out of the house!

31
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,700
I'm the one who's looking after our daughter!

32
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,720
What are you doing, huh?

33
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,800
You haven't taken responsibility for anything in your life!

34
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,579
What?

35
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,160
Hello?

36
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,620

00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,640
Rija, done?

41
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,660
Yes, mama!

42
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,120
Give it.

43
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,780
Rija, give me the brush!

44
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,660
Rija, why are you behaving like a two-year-old?

45
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,460
Give me the brush.

46
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,220
Leave it.

47
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,700
Rija, leave it right now!

Rija, leave the brush now!

50
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
What happened to this?

51
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,380
What'd you mean this?

52
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,000
What happened to this?

53
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,979
Don't you start lying to me as well!

54
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,739
I'm not lying.

55
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,560
You're too old to be behaving like this!

56
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,980
Rija...

57
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,200

Rija.

63
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,380
Look at me.

64
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,200
Rija.

65
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,000
It hasn't been easy for me, moving into your Nana's house

66
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,300
I'm really trying, Rija, toâ€”

67
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,539
Mama, please make Bobo go away, she scares me!

I'm not lying.
