1
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:33,999
Chalo.

2
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:41,124
Do two basket potatoes,
then phone a fish man.

3
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,582
-Hello, Mrs.
-Hello.

4
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,165
Hello, Mrs! (chuckles)

5
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:32,207
-All right, Charlie?
-Hiya.

6
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,999
I'll go, all right? Just leave me here.
I promise I'll go in.

7
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:53,082
You think I stupid?
I not your mam, mister.

8
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:56,540
I give you to teacher
and he bloody walk you in a school.

9
00:01:56,583 --> 00:02:00,624
(school bell ringing)

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,540
Mr Khan.

11
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,332
(speaking Urdu)

12
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,207
Uh...

13
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:11,499
Go with your teacher and stay
in the school. Or I bloody fixing you.

14
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:12,582
Don't worry, Mr Khan.

15
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,790
Come here, you Paki bastard! Get him!

16
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,582
(all exclaim)

17
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:29,874
Oh, no.

18
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,040
Nowhere to run now, Kid Curry.

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,457
(grunting)

20
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,332
(laughing)

21
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,790
-Oi, Gunga Din!
-Oh, shit!

22
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,332
To me, boy. To me.

23
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,499
Kya bloody baje do you call this
to be leaving us?

24
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,040
Sir?

25
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:59,582
The baje, lad! The skenning time.
Can you not speak Urdu?

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,999
No. I'm English, sir.

27
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:09,124
Rawalpindi. Do you know
Rawalpindi, Khan? Pakistan?

28
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,665
Never been, sir.

29
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,624
I was stationed out there just before
the outbreak of hostilities in '39.

30
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,582
Khushi thi bahutitwere and all.

31
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,415
Can you show me Pakistan
on that map, Khan?

32
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,040
Poland.

33
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:32,832
Switzerland.

34
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,415
Prestatyn.

35
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,165
Never mind. Sit yourself down, lad.

36
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,499
Tropical warfare. Not a pretty sight.

37
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,582
The jungle is a killer.

38
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,832
You get bitten by
the wrong type of mosquito out there

39
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,165
and before you know it, elephantitis.

40
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,749
Testicles swell up the size of mangoes

41
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,915
-and explode.
-Really, sir?

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,582
Two-minute check in the morning,
just to be sure.

43
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,332
Remember that, Khan,
if you're ever in the tropics.

44
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,582
-I will, sir. Two minutes, sir.
-But don't linger, lad.

45
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,165
Or you'll go blind.

46
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,999
(Jordan clears throat)

47
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,582
Your ignorance is a crime, Khan.

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,082
I shall endeavour to remedy it.

49
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:25,332
"He sat,
in defiance of municipal orders,

50
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,915
"astride the gun Zam-Zammah

51

opposite the old Ajaib-Gher,

00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:39,082
"the Wonder House,

53
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,457
-(grunts)
-(inhales deeply)

54
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,957
It's a pungent place, Khan.

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,915
Pungent. Sultry.

56
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,790
Sir?

57
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,290
Does it not conjure up the heat
for you, lad? Eh?

58
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,165
Can you not smell those spices?

59
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,790
I can when my dad makes a curry.

60
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,415
(grunts)

61
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:08,749
I can't make head nor bleedin' tail
of this. It's all squiggles.

62
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,249
(George) Is it in Urdu?

63
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,999
No. Maneer's writing. A chimpanzee
with a crayon would be clearer.

64
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,499
-(Annie) Give it here.
-Can I go out now?

65
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,915
(George) You go nowhere. It's a letter
from your brother in Pakistan.

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,957
-"Salam alaikum."
-Wa alaikum salam.

67
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,290
What do you say?

68
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,790
-Wa alaikum as-salam.
-(Annie) "Hiya, all.

69
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:32,457
"Everyone here in Pakistan
sends you their salams. "

70
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,832
Wa alaikum salam.

71
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,582
-Hey!
-It's only a letter.

72
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,665
I'll letter you in a minute, baster.
He's your brother.

73
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,457
You should show respect to him.
He in Pakistan!

74
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,249
Wa alaikum as-salam.

75
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,749
(George) All my family
in Pakistan happy.

76
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,457
Because Maneer is there, you see?

77
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,290
Yeah, I'll say.
He took enough cash for them.

78
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,415
"It's got dead hot over here
at the moment.

79
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,582
"And I've been working my

80
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,999
"bullocks"?

81
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,415
George just bought a new pair
for you-know-who.

82
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,249
-What she say?
-Bought Mrs Khan number one

83
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,999
a new pair of bullocks,
have you, George?

84
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,957
-First she's seen in years.
-(stifling laughter)

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,457
(George) Oh, stupy. (laughs)

86
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,832
All work farm together. See? Sharing.

87
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:21,832
If I'd have known
I'd be sharing me bullocks,

88
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,749
I wouldn't have married him
in the first place.

89
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:27,999
It's a man's job, see, Annie?
Having to be strong.

90
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,624
Holding like this.

91
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,915
(rolling R's)

92
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,582
It's good. Maneer working in the fields.

93
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,957
All my family, see? He just like them.

94
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,665
Just like a Pakistani. He can do, in'it?

95
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,165
Why didn't you buy him a tractor?

96
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,082
Why are you always a bloody stupy?

97
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,790
"Who holds Zam-Zammah,
that fire-breathing dragon,

98
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,957
"holds the Punjab."

99
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,124
Bollocks to the Punjab!

100
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,999

101
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,832

102
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,249
(inaudible)

103
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,499
So what part of India
are you from then, Shanti?

104
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,082
Oh, me dad, he's from Paki...

105
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,582
Um, Pakidilistan.

106
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,749
-Oh!
-It's a very spiritual place.

107
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:06,999
You know, these look good on you.

108
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:11,415
Oh, yeah, you were right.
Mmm, I find them really relaxing.

109
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,332
They're considered sacred
in my father's country.

110
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,165
-He sounds dead spiritual, your dad.
-Mmm.

111
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,332
(whispering) He's practically Gandhi.

112
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,790
(both chuckling)

113
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,665
Do you think these are good
for me chakras?

114
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:28,124
Oh, aye, yeah. It, um,

115
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,832
transen-tit-ises them.

116
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,457
(both chuckling)

117
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,999
You know, I give mine
a good going-over every night.

118
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,749
-Which is a blast.
-Shanti...

119
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,499
All right, our Tariq?

120
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,415
What the fuck are you doing here?

121
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,624
That doesn't sound
very Pakidilistani now, does it?

122
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,582
-I've come to see our Nazir.
-He's in Bradford buying stock.

123
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:54,332
-Why aren't you at school?
-We're on a trip. It's half day.

124
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,165
And I've spent my bus money on chips.
I need...

125
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:59,165
-Whoa. You spent your money on chips?
-Yeah.

126
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,457
We've got a fucking chippy at home,
you knobhead.

127
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,624
Out now.

128
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,749
-Just my little brother.
-All right?

129
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,665
-Hiya. What's your name?
-Ravi Shankar.

130
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:13,832
Bye!

131
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,915
That's the little bastard.

132
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:50,332
-MrJordan, what's happening?
-I'll kill him, baster.

133
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:53,499
Life, oh, best beloved,
is difficult for all men,

134
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,832
especially when we go from being
a man cub to a man,

135
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,832
and walk in a man's world.

136
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:14,832
-Baster! You make me ashamed!
-George, you've made your point.

137
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:19,457
-Point? I'll pucking kill him! Baster!
-That's enough, George.

138
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,082
Not even his bloody brothers
gave me trouble with the police.

139
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,999
-Yeah, and where are they now?
-Sajid.

140
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,582
I hate you!
Why don't you just fuck off?

141
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,915
What you... What you say to me?

142
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,915
-Get off me!
-(Ella) Stop it!

143
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,999
Get away from me,
you dirty Paki bastard!

144
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,249
You want to know
why I don't want to go to school?

145
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,290
It's 'cause they all know
you're a fucking Paki!

146
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,540
You listen to me.

147
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,290
I don't care what your dad does.

148
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,707
Don't let me ever catch you
using that word to him again.

149
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,707
-But he started it.
-Never! Do you hear me?

150
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:24,457
I've had enough of this behaviour
and it's got to stop.

151
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,832
It will stop.

152
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:38,040
(Ella) It's the kids at school, George.
The name-calling he gets.

153
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,624
How can my son say this to me?

154
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,207
Maybe he doesn't want to...

155
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,165
-To be a Pakistani?
-I'm not saying that.

156
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,832
But you're meaning this.

157
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,624
Is same with all my children.

158
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,457
Now all bloody English.

159
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,332
Well, so am I.
Or have you forgotten that?

160
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,165
You always take their side
against me. Why?

161
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,332
I your husband. You should support me.

162
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,832
-I'm still here with you, aren't I?
-It's no same thing.

163
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,499
Christ, George,
what do you want from me?

164
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,665
I no want it go wrong again.

165
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,832
Ella, he my last one.

166
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,665
This has to be done.

167
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,624
I know.

168
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,832
Don't mean I like it, though.

169
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,457
He not know who he is.
Not know who I am.

170
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,999
I tell you, he listen to me this time.
I bloody show him.

171
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,832
See? Bloody lovelies.

172
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,040

00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:49,749
Carry on the way you're going, you'll
be here a lot longer than you think.

348
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:51,499
Fuck off! Just fuck off!

349
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:12,165
You can fuck off and all, Mowgli.

350
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,999
Are you deaf, twat head?

351
00:31:27,541 --> 00:31:30,832
(singing in Hindi)

352
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:35,832
Come with me.

353
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:10,374
Here. Dead peoples.

354
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:13,082
-You want looky?
-Yeah, all right.

355
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:19,915
Bloody Nora! Dead bodies!

356
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:22,165
Who are they?

357
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:25,040
I think perhaps they're Moghul soldiers.
You know Moghul soldiers?

358
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,165
Fighting here, long time ago.

359
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,832
-Your English is all right.
-Hmm?

360
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,999
(enunciating) I mean,
you speak good English.

361
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:37,707
Better than you, yes. I do, true.
Pir Naseem's teaching me.

362
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:40,332
You speak Punjabi?

363
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:42,832
-No.
-Speak.

364
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:45,332
-It's not very good.
-Speaking, speaking.

365
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:46,832
(exhales uncertainly)

366
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:52,249
No, no, no. Don't say these words.
Very bad words.

367
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:53,707
Who say these words?

368
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:55,999
Me dad on the phone.
You know, the telephone.

369
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,707
-(cursing in Punjabi)
-(laughing)

370
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:03,999
(all greeting in Punjabi)

371
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:08,040
Maneer, you be respectful all the time.

372
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:09,665
-Right, Dad.
-And you,

373
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:12,165
say nothing.

374
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:15,165
No touch anyone. No look anybody.

375
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,665
(male worker) Maneer!

376
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,165
Why don't you just try?

377
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:28,707
You know I can't speak Pun-fucking-jabi.

378
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:31,040
Sajid! Answer him.

379
00:33:31,708 --> 00:33:33,082
Chigi-chigi-chigi!

380
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:34,582
All right! Fucking hell.

381
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:40,540
Bloody stupy!

382
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:42,207
-(repeating same phrase in Punjabi)
-(grunts in annoyance)

383
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:50,040
-Where you going?
-What?

384
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:51,665
In.

385
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:55,249
(repeating same phrase in Punjabi)

386
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,707
(scolds in Punjabi)

387
00:33:56,833 --> 00:34:00,915
(repeating same phrase in Punjabi)

388
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,415
-(bleats)
-(repeating same phrase in Punjabi)

389
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,415
Ah, this is the one.

390
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:18,499
Are you sure, Dad?
It was 30-odd years ago.

391
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:21,915
He was good friend. He at my wedding.

392
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:27,332
Abdullah! Jahangir.

393
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:31,165
He's a good boy.

394
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:33,665
She would live in England,

395
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:38,707
my wife will welcome her into our home
as if she were her own daughter.

396
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:42,040
You are my friend, Jahangir.

397
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,665
But there cannot be marriage
between my daughter and your son.

398
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:51,415
-But why?
-I mean you no disrespect.

399
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,165
But in England your life is

400
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,165
different.

401
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,749
Different from whose?

402
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:02,249
Girls here marry in England
all the time.

403
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:04,999
Your own eldest daughter
lives in England now.

404
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:07,207
I said your life, Jahangir.

405
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,374
I take it that were a "no", then.

406
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:26,707
No one want their daughter marry you.
I bloody ashamed!

407
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,874
Dad.

408
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:33,332
Oh! I'lljust find
me own way back, then, shall I?

409
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:36,332
It's not like I'm in the middle
of fucking nowhere, is it?

410
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:41,040
All right! Chigi-chigi-chigi!

411
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:42,707
(all laughing)

412
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,415
(door opens)

413
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,415
Are you all right, Dad?

414
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:24,332
It's all your fault, baster.

415
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:30,082
You and you family
pucking giving me trouble all the time.

416
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:35,832
Why you no go to your mam?

417
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:38,582
Get out of my house.

418
00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:41,332
I no want you here.

419
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:43,999
Go home!

420
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:45,582
You no belong here.

421
00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:47,415
You always said we do belong here.

422
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:50,332
-Go!
-What's changed your mind now, eh?

423
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:52,999
Don't talk to me like this.

424
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:54,832
You swan around here
like nothing's ever happened.

425
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,207
Jahangir Khan,
the King of England, returned.

426
00:36:57,416 --> 00:37:00,582
-Shut up! Shut up!
-Too near the truth, is it?

427
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:03,040
You make me laugh.

428
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,665
Bringing Sajid here
to teach him a lesson?

429
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:07,332
I warn you, mister.

430
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:08,999
What were you going
to teach him, eh, Dad?

431
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:11,665
How to dump his wife and kids
for 30 fucking years?

432
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:15,832
It's not me your friends won't
let their daughters marry.

433
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:17,749
It's you.

434
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:19,707
Get out!

435
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:41,999
(urging steer)

436
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,540
I mean, he's dead Pakistani
and everything, our Maneer is.

437
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:47,749
You can't fault him on that.

438
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:50,082
It's difficult.

439
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:52,999
And he's not that ugly.

440
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:56,207
-People worried.
-What about?

441
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,165
(grunts)

442
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,749
Go on. Tell me.

443
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:04,540
They think he will be like his father.

444
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,499
That maybe he will leave his wife here
and marry English woman.

445
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:12,832
-Like your father did.
-Maneer wouldn't do that.

446
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:16,749
Tanvir and Rehana tell people
this will happen.

447
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:19,249
They don't want you or Maneer
to live here.

448
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:21,332
I don't fucking want to live here!

449
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,415
They say your father will give
all the lands to his son,

450
00:38:25,708 --> 00:38:27,165
and his daughters nothing.

451
00:38:27,916 --> 00:38:31,040
Is that what all this is about?
Who gets left what?

452
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:34,207
They say you're not Pakistani.
Only half.

453
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:37,082
-And this is bad.
-Bad for me, all right.

454
00:38:37,166 --> 00:38:39,832
I keep getting my fucking head
kicked in for it in England.

455
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,415
What a pair of bastards!

456
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:48,165
Fuck 'em. And me dad.
I'll find Maneer a wife.

457
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:49,999
-(scoffs) You?
-Yeah.

458
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,499
He's good enough
for any of them around here.

459
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:57,165
Bit of a twat, mind.
But, you know, I'll fucking show 'em.

460
00:38:57,541 --> 00:38:59,707
-You can't do this.
-Yeah, I can.

461
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:01,332
You're gonna help me.

462
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:03,249
Sajid!

463
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:05,707
Baster.

464
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:07,332
Sajid!

465
00:39:07,416 --> 00:39:09,915
He's a long way from home, Jahangir.

466
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:14,040
He learn. Is why I bring here.

467
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:16,082
Sajid!

468
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:19,707
He run wild in England.

469
00:39:20,666 --> 00:39:23,499
-He's just a boy.
-You don't know him, Pir-ji.

470
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,749
He not know who he is.

471
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:29,915
All he know is he hate me.

472
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:33,332
-It's time he needs.
-He have that here, huh?

473
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:37,332
Master-jiEyaz will teach him
everything else.

474
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,665
You brought him here
to teach him about your life.

475
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:43,415
Let him discover it for himself.

476
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,165
And if he no like what he sees?

477
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,165
What if you don't like what you see?

478
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:53,165
Send the boy to me.
I'll settle him down.

479
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:57,415
Then he will be ready
for Master-jiEyaz and his books.

480
00:39:57,875 --> 00:39:59,374
He needs discipline.

481
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,332
Then, with your permission,

482
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:04,165
I'll beat him regularly.

483
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:07,999
(women chattering)

484
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:20,749
In Pakistan, they've got
the juiciest mangoes in the world.

485
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:23,207
What's that got to do
with getting Maneer a wife?

486
00:40:23,833 --> 00:40:27,040
-Mangoes grows on trees, and a woman...
-Oh!

487
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:30,915
When we pick a woman, we have
to remember how we pick mangoes.

488
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:32,874
Yank them off a branch, don't you?

489
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,415
You have to take time.
Pick the ripest fruit.

490
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,332
Best size, soft skin, but firm to touch.

491
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:43,415
And then, give them a little squeeze.

492
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,540
They'd chop me bleeding hands off
if you get caught.

493
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:46,999
Yeah.

494
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,374
What about her?

495
00:40:50,375 --> 00:40:53,040
(Zaid) Too old. Left on trees too long.

496
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,374
(Sajid) And the one in the red?

497
00:40:56,208 --> 00:40:59,749
Too much colour. Too much sun.
Very sour inside.

498
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,040
And the one next to her?

499
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:04,082
No. Taubah, taubah, taubah.

500
00:41:04,166 --> 00:41:06,415
Never, never, never
pick up fallen mangoes.

501
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:12,040
She shouts all the time. Talks too much.
Listens to the radio all night.

502
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:15,040
I think she makes a very bad wife.

503
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:17,165
Turned you down, did she?

504
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:18,749
Yeah.

505
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,832
-Have you, uh, ever had it off?
-Shut up!

506
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:25,082
Now get a move on. Pir Naseem's waiting.

507
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:28,332
-What kind of woman do you fancy?
-Shut up!

508
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:31,582
-I'm only asking, that's all.
-It's none of your business.

509
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:34,707
'Cause if people knew, they'd know
what to look for, wouldn't they?

510
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,165
Come on, will you?

511
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:39,915
Tall, small? Dark, light?
With plait, without plait?

512
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:44,665
-Get a move on.
-I'm not going. He's madder than me.

513
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:48,707
Okay. Make your own flippin' mind up.
I've had enough.

514
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:04,332
Hello? Anyone there?

515
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:07,582
Hello!

516
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:11,832
(flute playing distantly)

517
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:30,582
You're early.

518
00:42:30,666 --> 00:42:32,540
-I'm not staying.
-You don't have to.

519
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:35,832
You're supposed to
teach me something, aren't you?

520
00:42:36,208 --> 00:42:37,665
What do you want to know?

521
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:49,832
Never make friends
with an elephant keeper

522
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:52,832
if you have no room in your house
to entertain his elephant.

523
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,749
What's that supposed to mean?

524
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:59,582
If you're not staying,
what's the point in telling you?

525
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,999
Not very good, are you?

526
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:09,665
No.

527
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,665
I never have been.

528
00:43:13,708 --> 00:43:16,832
But it occupies the time
and helps me to think.

529
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:20,915
And anything that stimulates thinking
is a good thing.

530
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:23,665
-What do you think about?
-Oh.

531
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:26,707
Entertaining elephants.

532
00:43:28,708 --> 00:43:30,165
(laughing)

533
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,582
Come. Are you afraid of an old man?

534
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:40,165
I ain't scared of anything.

535
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:41,665
You could be a head-the-ball,
for all I know.

536
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:44,707
-What's a "head-the-ball"?
-A nutter.

537
00:43:44,916 --> 00:43:47,540
-Someone that's poggled.
-Poggled. Yes, yes, yes.

538
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,374
It has been said of me before.
(laughing)

539
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:54,540
Head-the-ball!

540
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:08,665
-Bleedin' hell!
-That's as good a phrase as any.

541
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:14,832
Go. Go and explore. Go on, I'll be here.

542
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:34,665
(Pir Naseem) Time. That's time, Sajid,

543
00:46:35,958 --> 00:46:37,999
spread out before you.

544
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:40,707
Thousands of people
populated those stones,

545
00:46:40,791 --> 00:46:43,707
each one leaving a trace of themselves
on the other.

546
00:46:43,833 --> 00:46:46,124
All leading to you.

547
00:46:46,541 --> 00:46:48,332
-Me?
-Yes, of course.

548
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:51,707
We're all part of the same story.

549
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:55,624
And we, in our turn,
will leave traces of ourselves, too.

550
00:46:56,708 --> 00:47:00,165
But what we leave,
and how we choose to leave it,

551
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:01,999
is entirely up to us.

552
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:05,499
That's what makes life so interesting.

553
00:47:10,708 --> 00:47:16,457
(clattering)

554
00:47:37,791 --> 00:47:39,290
Huh?

555
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,999
(lamenting in Punjabi)

556
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:52,999
(sobbing)

557
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:32,999
We did lot of repair recently, Uncle.

558
00:49:33,958 --> 00:49:37,624
The roof, the wall was falling down.
But I took care of it.

559
00:49:37,666 --> 00:49:39,040
Mmm.

560
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,665
It is looking good, haina, Uncle?

561
00:49:45,375 --> 00:49:47,332
You can go to England next week,

562
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:50,332
with no worries
about what is happening here.

563
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,665
Everything is in safe hands.

564
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:56,665
I no going back yet.

565
00:49:57,166 --> 00:49:58,665
Huh?

566
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:00,374
(Poppa chuckling nervously)

567
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:04,874
Time we had new house. Modern.

568
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:08,540
New house?
But Uncle, that is very expensive.

569
00:50:08,666 --> 00:50:10,832
And time. What about chippy chop?

570
00:50:12,166 --> 00:50:15,665
-I worry about time and money.
-Auntie Ella in England?

571
00:50:18,666 --> 00:50:20,040
We build there.

572
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:22,207
Pull that damn thing down.

573
00:50:29,833 --> 00:50:31,207
Here.

574
00:50:32,958 --> 00:50:34,332
Nice.

575
00:50:35,208 --> 00:50:36,665
Good.

576
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:43,999
(Hindi song playing on radio)

577
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,665
I think I would like
to get married soon.

578
00:50:47,833 --> 00:50:49,290
(Sajid) Me, too.

579
00:50:49,666 --> 00:50:53,540
I want... You know. Soon.

580
00:50:53,875 --> 00:50:55,332
Me, too.

581
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,999
Will you get married
to a Pakistani girl?

582
00:51:00,041 --> 00:51:01,832
If they all milk cows like that,
I might.

583
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,874
(Sajid) Lucky cow.

584
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:07,790
(both laughing)

585
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:12,665
(indistinct chattering)

586
00:51:23,166 --> 00:51:24,540
(Sajid) Oh, my God.

587
00:51:27,541 --> 00:51:28,957
-Come on.
-What is it?

588
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:31,165
It's Nana Mouskouri.

589
00:51:35,166 --> 00:51:38,374
Quick! We're gonna lose her.
You take that roof, I'll take this one.

590
00:52:01,333 --> 00:52:02,707
Oh, shit.

591
00:52:29,125 --> 00:52:30,624
(inaudible)

592
00:53:03,875 --> 00:53:05,999
That one'll turn on you
if you're not careful.

593
00:53:06,041 --> 00:53:09,499
He's right, chacha. Maybe you
start off with the water buffalo?

594
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:11,832
I know what I bloody doing.

595
00:53:11,958 --> 00:53:13,332
(scoffs)

596
00:53:17,625 --> 00:53:21,207
I doing this when I same size as Sajid.

597
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:27,665
(urging steer)

598
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:31,665
No, no, no.

599
00:53:32,791 --> 00:53:34,332
What a dickhead.

600
00:53:35,708 --> 00:53:37,624
(continues urging steer)

601
00:53:48,166 --> 00:53:51,165
-(laughing) See?
-(Poppa laughing)Very good, chacha.

602
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:53,874
(George) No, no, no, no!

603
00:53:58,625 --> 00:53:59,999
Move, basters!

604
00:54:00,833 --> 00:54:02,832
(George barking orders
in growing frustration)

605
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,665
(sighs)

606
00:54:18,291 --> 00:54:20,999
You are just a bit out of practice,
chacha.

607
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:31,165
I go back to house.

608
00:55:43,458 --> 00:55:44,832
(groans softly)

609
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:21,207
(Pir Naseem) How does it feel?

610
00:56:22,333 --> 00:56:24,624
-Looks all right.
-But how does it feel?

611
00:56:25,333 --> 00:56:27,707
Comfortable. I feel comfortable.

612
00:56:28,708 --> 00:56:30,165
Good.

613
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:34,374
"He sat,
in defiance of municipal orders,

614
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,540
"astride the gun Zam-Zammah

615
00:56:38,166 --> 00:56:42,499
"on her brick platform
opposite the old Ajaib-Gher,

616
00:56:42,958 --> 00:56:47,665
"the Wonder House,
as the natives call the Lahore Museum."

617
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,374
"Natives"?

618
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,374
-What Imperialist rubbish!
-(impatiently) Pir-ji!

619
00:56:56,666 --> 00:56:58,332
Very well.

620
00:56:58,708 --> 00:57:02,374
"Who holds Zam-Zammah,
that fire-breathing cannon..."

621
00:57:02,875 --> 00:57:04,540
-Holds the Punjab!
-Holds the Punjab!

622
00:57:05,041 --> 00:57:07,707
(George distantly) Sajid! Come now!

623
00:57:08,666 --> 00:57:11,207
Come. I'll walk with you.

624
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:19,665
He's been asking me what you've
been teaching me all this time.

625
00:57:19,666 --> 00:57:22,374
-Ah? And what did you tell him?
-That you won't tell me anything.

626
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,957
(laughs)

627
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,499
Very good. Very good!

628
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:27,665
I wish you to remain ignorant.

629
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:30,540
He's still going on
about me being more Pakistani and that.

630
00:57:30,666 --> 00:57:32,499
-You know, traditional.
-Mmm.

631
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:34,790
Your father, and many like him,

632
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:36,999
have made better lives
for themselves abroad.

633
00:57:37,875 --> 00:57:40,207
But do you think you can move
to another country

634
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:42,999
and expect to find everything the same?

635
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:46,874
That your new world
will not affect your life?

636
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,790
As for tradition, well,

637
00:57:51,541 --> 00:57:54,832
I walk to my hut every night
by the same path.

638
00:57:55,625 --> 00:57:59,040
Now, if a cobra decides to sit
in the middle of that path,

639
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:01,290
do I walk on and get bitten?

640
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:03,999
Or do I take the other path and live?

641
00:58:05,333 --> 00:58:09,290
We have to adapt to the situations
and worlds we find ourselves in.

642
00:58:10,166 --> 00:58:11,665
The alternative...

643
00:58:11,666 --> 00:58:13,165
Is you'll get your arse
bitten by a snake.

644
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:16,165
(laughing) Yes. Amongst other things.

645
00:58:16,958 --> 00:58:18,332
-(George) Sajid!
-Ah!

646
00:58:18,458 --> 00:58:20,832
Go. Your father's waiting for you.

647
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,790
Have you just taught me something?

648
00:58:36,166 --> 00:58:37,624
(grunting)

649
00:58:41,541 --> 00:58:42,999
(exclaiming)

650
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:49,499
(Sajid) Who holds Zam-Zammah
holds the Punjab!

651
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,999
Who holds Zam-Zammah holds the Punjab!

652
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,457
Oh!

653
00:59:10,833 --> 00:59:16,832
(chuckling)

654
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:29,082
You see all life
at the Khari Sharif, Sajid.

655
01:01:29,166 --> 01:01:31,165
People from all over the world

656
01:01:31,291 --> 01:01:34,457
travel to worship
at the shrine of the Saint.

657
01:01:34,833 --> 01:01:37,790
All are welcome
who are in search of the light,

658
01:01:37,833 --> 01:01:40,499
no matter what path they follow.

659
01:01:41,666 --> 01:01:43,582
(whispering conspiratorially) Come.
Let me show you something.

660
01:01:57,125 --> 01:01:59,665
-What's the point of this one?
-What do you see?

661
01:02:00,291 --> 01:02:01,665
Nothing.

662
01:02:01,791 --> 01:02:03,332
Really?

663
01:02:04,125 --> 01:02:07,332
Is it the same rude boy
who didn't like my flute playing?

664
01:02:09,166 --> 01:02:11,915
I don't know any more.
I don't know what they want.

665
01:02:12,666 --> 01:02:14,332
I don't know who I'm supposed to be.

666
01:02:14,666 --> 01:02:16,332
But you still look like you.

667
01:02:17,458 --> 01:02:19,165
What needs changing?

668
01:02:19,291 --> 01:02:20,665
The boy?

669
01:02:20,791 --> 01:02:22,249
Or the world around him?

670
01:02:24,291 --> 01:02:27,165
(singing traditional music)

671
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:09,915
Sajid.

672
01:03:31,166 --> 01:03:32,832
Thank you for looking after him.

673
01:03:34,125 --> 01:03:36,332
Sajid needs no looking after.

674
01:03:36,416 --> 01:03:39,915
No, he has changed. I see it.

675
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,249
He not the boy I brought here.

676
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:45,665
That boy will always be there.

677
01:03:45,791 --> 01:03:47,749
You just have to learn to accept him.

678
01:03:49,666 --> 01:03:51,665
He's part of you, Jahangir.

679
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,957
Of your past, your future.

680
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:57,999
Part of the world you created for him.

681
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,957
When Sajid look at you,

682
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:04,165
there's love in his eyes.

683
01:04:05,416 --> 01:04:07,457
If only he'd do the same to me.

684
01:04:08,333 --> 01:04:09,832
Just once.

685
01:04:16,625 --> 01:04:18,082
(♪ Main Ho Gaee Dildar Ki)

686
01:04:25,458 --> 01:04:26,957
(lip-synching lyrics)

687
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:51,165
(honking)

688
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:58,332
(musicians singing)

689
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:08,624
(inaudible)

690
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:11,165
-Come on!
-Where?

691
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:12,665
We're going to a wedding.

692
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,082
(singing)

693
01:05:26,083 --> 01:05:30,457
(all cheering in time)

694
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:53,665
Come on, now's our chance.

695
01:06:03,333 --> 01:06:06,249
-Salam alaikum.
-Wa alaikum as-salam.

696
01:06:06,666 --> 01:06:08,624
-Say exactly what I say, all right?
-Yeah.

697
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:10,749
Massi-ji, I hope you do not think

698
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:13,999
that I am being disrespectful
to you or your family.

699
01:06:16,833 --> 01:06:18,332
We are from the same village.

700
01:06:19,833 --> 01:06:23,582
I am the son ofJahangir Khan.
The fish fryer.

701
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:33,499
From long way across the big water,
in Salford, England.

702
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:37,332
Near Bradford?

703
01:06:39,666 --> 01:06:41,415
(murmuring in sudden comprehension)

704
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:45,499
I have seen your daughter,

705
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:47,665
though I haven't been looking at her

706
01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:49,582
in the way that you are thinking.

707
01:06:50,125 --> 01:06:52,249
-You know...
-(in Lancashire accent) Aye,

708
01:06:52,333 --> 01:06:54,165
and you're gonna get yourself
in heap big bleedin' trouble

709
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:56,499
as well, pale face,
if you keep following me about.

710
01:06:56,666 --> 01:06:58,832
-Where are you from?
-Japan.

711
01:06:59,458 --> 01:07:01,124
Where do you think, knobhead? Rochdale.

712
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,582
-What you doing here?
-After a husband.

713
01:07:03,666 --> 01:07:05,582
-What about you?
-After a wife.

714
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,415
(speaking Punjabi)

715
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,165
(girls giggling)

716
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,082
Do you think I'm a cradle snatcher?

717
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:14,165
I'd like to talk to your dad, actually.
I've got a proposition for him.

718
01:07:15,333 --> 01:07:17,832
He's dead. Tell us.
We make all the decisions now.

719
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:20,499
(chattering in Punjabi)

720
01:07:39,625 --> 01:07:41,165
(Sajid urging goats)

721
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:49,749
(horn honking)

722
01:08:09,666 --> 01:08:11,165
(murmuring) Ella?

723
01:08:20,958 --> 01:08:23,957
Hiya, George. Bet I'm the last person
you thought you'd see.

724
01:08:39,458 --> 01:08:40,915
(exclaiming softly)

725
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,499
I knew crimplene would be wrong
for this weather.

726
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:46,332
(sighs)

727
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,499
Mmm! These are the best kebabs
I have ever tasted.

728
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,165
And I know my kebabs.

729
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:02,374
Try them, Ella,
they're bleedin' gorgeous.

730
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:06,457
(enunciating loudly)
Did you make them, love?

731
01:09:07,208 --> 01:09:11,082
I'll have to get your recipe.
Swap you with one of mine.

732
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:13,999
Has she ever had roly-poly pudding?

733
01:09:15,791 --> 01:09:17,957
Oh, no, ta, cock. I'm stuffed.

734
01:09:21,125 --> 01:09:25,874
Um... Hmm? No? No? Mmm?

735
01:09:32,708 --> 01:09:34,249
(cigarette lighter clicking)

736
01:09:36,916 --> 01:09:39,582
(Annie) Mmm! (exhales)

737
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:45,124
(clears throat) So, Annie,

738
01:09:45,208 --> 01:09:47,374
who look after your Peter
while you're here?

739
01:09:49,083 --> 01:09:50,999
(loudly) That's my husband.

740
01:09:53,166 --> 01:09:54,707
Husband.

741
01:09:55,166 --> 01:09:58,290
No, he's fine, George.
I got a load of baked beans in for him.

742
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:03,457
(enunciating loudly)
My husband is bloody useless.

743
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:06,749
(chuckles) He's only good for one thing.

744
01:10:06,833 --> 01:10:08,499
And he's never been very good at that!

745
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:10,040
(sniggering)

746
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:13,832
How is chippy chop?

747
01:10:19,958 --> 01:10:21,499
Shut.

748
01:10:23,083 --> 01:10:24,499
Mam?

749
01:10:25,208 --> 01:10:26,582
Maneer!

750
01:10:26,666 --> 01:10:28,332
(chuckling excitedly)

751
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:33,749
-Flower. Flower!
-Auntie Annie. (laughing)

752
01:10:34,125 --> 01:10:35,540
(Annie grunting affectionately)

753
01:10:35,875 --> 01:10:39,207
Hello, love!
Well, come here and give us a kiss.

754
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,207
I've missed you!

755
01:10:43,291 --> 01:10:44,790
You look so different.

756
01:10:44,875 --> 01:10:47,499
-What are you doing here?
-I...

757
01:10:47,541 --> 01:10:49,332
I've come to take you home.

758
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:51,499
I'm not going!

759
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:54,957
Sajid?

760
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:06,790
So, this is
where he keeps the harem, then.

761
01:11:06,875 --> 01:11:08,499
Piss off, you.

762
01:11:08,541 --> 01:11:11,165
Don't worry about Sajid, Mam.
A lot's happened.

763
01:11:14,916 --> 01:11:18,624
Right! Maneer,
you were gonna show me the loo?

764
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,957
Uh, everything all right?

765
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:30,290
You can make it more lighting
if you wanting.

766
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,749
(chuckles) You make me
a bloody surprise seeing you here.

767
01:11:37,708 --> 01:11:39,165
Yeah?

768
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:42,415
Think how surprised I was
when I didn't see you after four weeks.

769
01:11:53,083 --> 01:11:56,499
I had it all worked out, what I was
going to say to you when I saw you.

770
01:11:57,166 --> 01:11:58,665
Now I'm here,

771
01:12:00,208 --> 01:12:02,999
I don't know what I'm more angry about.

772
01:12:03,958 --> 01:12:06,082
That you've been gone months,

773
01:12:06,166 --> 01:12:08,915
or that you cleaned
the bank account out.

774
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,999
I needing more money for house.

775
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,415
And what was I supposed to live on?

776
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,874
Scotch bleedin' mist?

777
01:12:19,958 --> 01:12:21,457
A month we said, George.

778
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:23,499
-Ella...
-We agreed.

779
01:12:24,083 --> 01:12:28,415
I don't remember anyone talking about
you building a bastard house out here!

780
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,790
I was to go write letter, but, uh...

781
01:12:30,875 --> 01:12:32,957
Did I deserve this, did I?

782
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:36,707
All these years, doing things your way?

783
01:12:37,291 --> 01:12:39,957
Trying to make the kids understand you.

784
01:12:40,916 --> 01:12:42,415
And you do this to me?

785
01:12:42,666 --> 01:12:44,207
What?

786
01:12:44,291 --> 01:12:48,332
-I... I only...
-You made me look stupid

787
01:12:48,416 --> 01:12:50,832
-in front of everyone.
-No, Ella.

788
01:12:51,541 --> 01:12:54,249
(Ella) Oh, what's the bleedin' point?

789
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,832
(George) Basheera, my daughters...
When I see how things are here...

790
01:13:00,333 --> 01:13:03,374
-Ella, I having to...
-Or was it my turn, was it, George?

791
01:13:04,125 --> 01:13:06,832
To hang about,
waiting for you to come home?

792
01:13:06,916 --> 01:13:09,540
Like that poor cow out there?

793
01:13:10,291 --> 01:13:11,874
I never mean to hurt you, Ella.

794
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:15,499
I only come to help with Sajid.
Then, uh...

795
01:13:17,291 --> 01:13:18,707
Then what?

796
01:13:27,666 --> 01:13:29,999
We'll not be here long.

797
01:13:30,083 --> 01:13:31,915
I just came for Sajid.

798
01:13:33,833 --> 01:13:36,082
-Ella...
-Just leave me, George.

799
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:45,249
(sighing)

800
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:56,290
(snoring fitfully)

801
01:14:00,125 --> 01:14:02,124
(grunting)

802
01:14:02,666 --> 01:14:04,165
Annie!

803
01:14:06,166 --> 01:14:07,790
(stomach rumbling)

804
01:14:08,875 --> 01:14:10,374
-Annie.
-(loud gurgling)

805
01:14:10,458 --> 01:14:11,915
Oh!

806
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,540
It's probably wind.

807
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:16,874
Probably kebabs.
I need the little girls' field.

808
01:14:17,458 --> 01:14:18,874
Quick!

809
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:24,832
(whispering) Told you the food
was going to be richer over here.

810
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:28,124
-(stomach gurgling)
-Ow! Ooh!

811
01:14:28,208 --> 01:14:30,749
Good Jesus tonight, that was close.

812
01:14:35,208 --> 01:14:37,207
I don't think I can hold it in
any longer.

813
01:14:37,291 --> 01:14:40,040
Don't you dare shit yourself
in front of this lot.

814
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,707
(nervously) Hi.

815
01:14:45,791 --> 01:14:47,624
March on. Think of Salford.

816
01:14:47,708 --> 01:14:49,415
(gurgling continues)

817
01:14:52,708 --> 01:14:55,207
(Annie groaning)

818
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,374
Nearly finished, Uncle, huh?

819
01:15:17,875 --> 01:15:19,374
(George grunts equivocally)

820
01:15:20,791 --> 01:15:22,290
Maybe.

821
01:15:24,166 --> 01:15:25,582
Good work.

822
01:15:28,041 --> 01:15:32,707
Have you thought about what
you're going to do, now it is finished?

823
01:15:35,166 --> 01:15:39,540
Only, the family were wondering
if you would be staying here,

824
01:15:39,625 --> 01:15:43,415
or going back to England
with Auntie Ella and the boys.

825
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:49,124
(quietly) Perhaps we can't go back.

826
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:54,415
You, the boys and Auntie,
is that, Uncle?

827
01:15:58,458 --> 01:16:00,707
Maybe I should never have left.

828
01:16:07,458 --> 01:16:08,874
Uh...

829
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,124
Does this look like burnt copper to you?

830
01:16:25,833 --> 01:16:27,749
More like tandoori red.

831
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:34,915
(exhales forcefully)

832
01:16:47,166 --> 01:16:49,415
(Poppa) This house was built
for everybody, you know?

833
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:52,957
Yeah, well, I'm living in it now
and will be till I decide to leave.

834
01:16:53,333 --> 01:16:56,374
-Oh, no, me mam. Here we go. Come on.
-Leave them to it!

835
01:16:56,458 --> 01:16:58,040
(Rehana shouting)

836
01:16:59,625 --> 01:17:01,082
Mam. Come on.

837
01:17:01,166 --> 01:17:02,582
-Come on, Ella, leave it.
-No!

838
01:17:04,625 --> 01:17:06,707
England, is it, love?
Well, don't knock it,

839
01:17:06,791 --> 01:17:08,499
'cause it's kept you
for the past 30 years!

840
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:12,249
But actually, Auntie, we have worked
very hard here, isn't it, Uncle?

841
01:17:12,333 --> 01:17:15,957
You? You haven't done a hard day's work
in your life, you bone-idle bastard.

842
01:17:16,291 --> 01:17:19,499
And don't you start, either,
'cause I'm ready for you as well.

843
01:17:28,375 --> 01:17:29,624
No, enough.

844
01:17:33,541 --> 01:17:37,207
She had a terrible life.
A hard life with no husband.

845
01:17:37,666 --> 01:17:39,332
Do you think mine was any easier,
do you?

846
01:17:39,583 --> 01:17:42,124
Watching every penny we made
being sent over here,

847
01:17:42,208 --> 01:17:45,957
to buy more bleedin' land
than none of my kids will ever see?

848
01:17:47,041 --> 01:17:49,749
Your kids have never seen
a real father, is it, love?

849
01:17:49,875 --> 01:17:51,624
Well, nor have mine.

850
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:54,207
They won't come near my house
because of him.

851
01:17:54,291 --> 01:17:56,457
So don't you tell me
what a hard life you've had,

852
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:59,290
'cause I've had it in spades.
And what have I got to show for it?

853
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:04,457
-Nothing! Not even my kids!
-Shut it! Shut up, will you?

854
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:13,832
(mooing)

855
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:39,790
Maneer! Have you seen our Sajid?

856
01:18:41,625 --> 01:18:43,040
No!

857
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,415
What matter?

858
01:18:45,875 --> 01:18:48,749
It's Sajid!
He's still out in this somewhere!

859
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:56,790
(urging cattle)

860
01:18:59,791 --> 01:19:02,999
I go looking. You stay here. Go inside!

861
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:05,957
Find him, George!

862
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:12,874
(shutters banging)

863
01:19:17,125 --> 01:19:18,540
Jesus.

864
01:19:25,833 --> 01:19:27,332
Not now.

865
01:19:27,416 --> 01:19:28,874
I can't do this now.

866
01:19:57,708 --> 01:19:59,165
Oh, you were...

867
01:20:01,291 --> 01:20:03,290
You were very beautiful.

868
01:20:06,166 --> 01:20:07,540
You,

869
01:20:08,166 --> 01:20:09,540
beautiful.

870
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:55,790
Jahangir...

871
01:21:01,458 --> 01:21:04,124
I didn't know about you,

872
01:21:05,541 --> 01:21:06,957
either.

873
01:21:40,166 --> 01:21:41,540
I...

874
01:21:42,125 --> 01:21:43,915
I don't know what you're saying.

875
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:47,207
But you sound very kind.

876
01:21:50,125 --> 01:21:51,749
You shouldn't be.

877
01:21:52,625 --> 01:21:54,999
He's been with me all these years,

878
01:21:55,083 --> 01:21:58,582
and I've never really asked him
about you and your girls.

879
01:22:00,333 --> 01:22:02,582
I don't think I wanted to know.

880
01:22:04,708 --> 01:22:06,207
I didn't care.

881
01:22:08,125 --> 01:22:09,582
Do you understand me?

882
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:35,040
Jahangir...

883
01:23:17,416 --> 01:23:18,790
(sighs)

884
01:23:18,875 --> 01:23:20,790
-Okay?
-Yeah, yeah.

885
01:23:22,166 --> 01:23:23,540
Open your eyes.

886
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:25,124
(blows)

887
01:23:30,375 --> 01:23:31,832
(sighs)

888
01:23:36,708 --> 01:23:40,415
I always wanting going those villages
up there in the hills.

889
01:23:42,166 --> 01:23:45,290
And villages after them,
and after them, and after them.

890
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:49,457
No one believe I would go do this thing.

891
01:23:50,166 --> 01:23:51,999
My father laugh at me.

892
01:23:53,166 --> 01:23:54,540
And did you?

893
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,707
(chuckles) What you thinking?

894
01:23:57,291 --> 01:23:58,707
I reckon you probably did it.

895
01:23:59,958 --> 01:24:02,957
Everyone in the village stand there
and watch me go.

896
01:24:03,833 --> 01:24:06,082
I only maybe same age as you.

897
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:08,374
Weren't you scared?

898
01:24:09,333 --> 01:24:13,124
Only when I was walking out of a village
and then walking back in.

899
01:24:16,958 --> 01:24:18,540
And one day,

900
01:24:19,541 --> 01:24:21,457
I walk out and no come back.

901
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,957
No see my parents again.

902
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,749
Never see my children grow up.

903
01:24:31,458 --> 01:24:33,082
No see Basheera.

904
01:24:36,333 --> 01:24:38,624
It's terrible thing I do, Sajid.

905
01:24:41,708 --> 01:24:43,790
But you found your way back, didn't you?

906
01:24:43,875 --> 01:24:46,707
That's the important thing.
You came back.

907
01:24:47,083 --> 01:24:48,457
(chuckles softly)

908
01:24:54,291 --> 01:24:55,874
Come, let's go back home.

909
01:25:03,541 --> 01:25:05,124
Here.

910
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,457
Sajid.

911
01:25:31,625 --> 01:25:33,165
Who are you waving at?

912
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:34,832
Oh, I thought I saw Pir Naseem.

913
01:25:35,166 --> 01:25:37,290
Aye up, Mam, they're coming.

914
01:25:41,833 --> 01:25:43,665
Quick, bend.

915
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:45,165
Mam!

916
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:47,207
He'll be more impressed with three.

917
01:25:47,916 --> 01:25:49,332
He'd better be,

918
01:25:49,416 --> 01:25:52,707
'cause I'm only going to be
turning the bleedin' tap on in England.

919
01:25:56,958 --> 01:25:58,415
All right, Sajid?

920
01:26:00,541 --> 01:26:02,249
All right, Nelly? This is our Maneer.

921
01:26:02,333 --> 01:26:03,749
All right, Maneer?

922
01:26:04,666 --> 01:26:06,915
(nervously) Yeah. Yeah, hiya.

923
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,207
-(stammering) I mean, salam alaikum.
-Wa alaikum salam.

924
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:12,582
Been here long have you?

925
01:26:12,666 --> 01:26:14,707
Um, about...

926
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,540
Year or so, eh, Maneer?

927
01:26:17,625 --> 01:26:19,040
Yeah, year or so.

928
01:26:19,125 --> 01:26:20,874
And you're looking to get married,
I hear.

929
01:26:21,875 --> 01:26:23,457
-Am I?
-(tensely) Yes, you are.

930
01:26:24,041 --> 01:26:26,332
-Yes, I am.
-So am I.

931
01:26:27,791 --> 01:26:30,540
-Did he say...
-Is he all there,

932
01:26:30,625 --> 01:26:32,624
-or does he want it in sign language?
-Sorry.

933
01:26:32,708 --> 01:26:35,624
(stammering) Excuse me, I've got...

934
01:26:35,708 --> 01:26:39,832
Oi! I've got three pots
on me head, you know!

935
01:26:42,916 --> 01:26:45,915
-So what do you think, then?
-I love a decisive man, me.

936
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,874
-Is that a yes, then?
-Not pushy or owt, are you?

937
01:26:50,125 --> 01:26:51,582
You better bring him round
to meet me mam.

938
01:26:52,375 --> 01:26:54,124
Now sod off
so I can get rid of these bleedin' pots

939
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:55,624
before they do me neck in.

940
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:58,290
Yes!

941
01:27:01,541 --> 01:27:03,957
Who is she? Where does she come from?
How do you know her?

942
01:27:04,125 --> 01:27:06,249
Her name's Neelam Haqq.
She's from Rochdale

943
01:27:06,333 --> 01:27:07,957
-and she works in the dentist's.
-What else?

944
01:27:08,041 --> 01:27:09,457
She's got nice teeth, ain't she?

945
01:27:09,541 --> 01:27:11,207
She's not engaged or married or owt,
is she?

946
01:27:11,291 --> 01:27:13,999
Keep your hair on.
I've arranged for everything, all right?

947
01:27:14,083 --> 01:27:16,499
We'll go and meet her mam,
who I know quite well,

948
01:27:16,583 --> 01:27:18,124
so I don't foresee any problems.

949
01:27:23,416 --> 01:27:26,457
So does she meet with your satisfaction,
or shall I tell her you don't fancy her?

950
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:28,874
No! I like her. She looks...

951
01:27:29,083 --> 01:27:30,457
She looks like...

952
01:27:30,625 --> 01:27:32,082
I know.

953
01:27:32,166 --> 01:27:33,874
I'm great, me, aren't I?

954
01:27:41,875 --> 01:27:43,415
(door creaking)

955
01:27:48,083 --> 01:27:49,915
Well, come in, if you're coming in.

956
01:27:55,666 --> 01:27:57,249
Uh... (clears throat)

957
01:27:57,875 --> 01:28:00,540
I wanted, uh, ask you

958
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:03,207
for help me.

959
01:28:04,666 --> 01:28:06,124
Oh, yeah?

960
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,124
Maneer, he tell me
he see girl in village.

961
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:13,082
Our Sajid said.

962
01:28:13,541 --> 01:28:17,915
He ask if possible arrange engagement.

963
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:21,999
Will you come with me?

964
01:28:22,958 --> 01:28:24,374
If you think it'll help.

965
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,040
Yeah?

966
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,124
(sighs)

967
01:28:31,416 --> 01:28:35,415
All years in England,
I think about Pakistan.

968
01:28:36,416 --> 01:28:37,832
Wife and the children.

969
01:28:38,541 --> 01:28:40,457
You don't have to say anything.

970
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:41,957
No, Ella.

971
01:28:42,458 --> 01:28:44,082
All years I send money,

972
01:28:45,208 --> 01:28:46,999
I think I good man,

973
01:28:48,541 --> 01:28:50,499
look after family here.

974
01:28:51,791 --> 01:28:54,999
But I not really think about them.
You know?

975
01:28:57,083 --> 01:28:59,957
What happening. How their lives are.

976
01:29:01,875 --> 01:29:03,832
When I bring Sajid here,

977
01:29:05,166 --> 01:29:06,624
when I see them,

978
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:10,582
it make me feel so bad inside.

979
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:16,124
It make me feel like I wanting die.

980
01:29:18,416 --> 01:29:20,457
Is why I stay here so long.

981
01:29:21,458 --> 01:29:22,957
I ashamed myself.

982
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:24,915
I know, George.

983
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:28,165
(voice breaking) You good woman, Ella.

984
01:29:30,666 --> 01:29:32,207
Always looking after me,

985
01:29:32,625 --> 01:29:34,290
believing in me.

986
01:29:36,625 --> 01:29:38,957
Even when people call you name
on a street

987
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:41,582
because you are with a Pakistani man.

988
01:29:44,083 --> 01:29:46,290
I see how they make you feel.

989
01:29:48,541 --> 01:29:50,457
But you never care.

990
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,957
(stifling sobs) You take my arm
and walk with me.

991
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:57,624
And I treat you like this.

992
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:02,290
I sorry. I'm... I wrong.

993
01:30:04,583 --> 01:30:06,040
(crying softly)

994
01:30:09,791 --> 01:30:11,249
George.

995
01:30:12,458 --> 01:30:14,124
I love you, Ella.

996
01:30:19,625 --> 01:30:22,665
I love you, too, you daft bugger.

997
01:30:26,041 --> 01:30:27,749
(both crying softly)

998
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,249
(children shouting excitedly)

999
01:30:38,458 --> 01:30:42,165
(indistinct)

1000
01:30:47,875 --> 01:30:50,457
-Salam alaikum, Ji.
-(George) Wa alaikum as-salam.

1001
01:30:55,541 --> 01:30:57,082
(breathing deeply)

1002
01:30:57,166 --> 01:31:00,082
Oh, God.
I didn't think you were gonna come.

1003
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,457
Hot, isn't it?
Did you find it hot when you got here?

1004
01:31:03,541 --> 01:31:06,790
I was sweating cobs, me,
when I first came. Weren't I, Mam?

1005
01:31:06,875 --> 01:31:10,165
Drenched in it, I was.
I know your Sajid were and all.

1006
01:31:10,250 --> 01:31:13,665
Oh, he's dead nice, him, isn't he?
I bet he's a handful, though.

1007
01:31:14,041 --> 01:31:16,832
Told me all he'd been up to.
God, what a little bleeder...

1008
01:31:17,291 --> 01:31:19,540
Sorry. I'm dead nervous, me.
I just run off at the mouth

1009
01:31:19,666 --> 01:31:21,457
like I'm doing now.
(chuckles nervously)

1010
01:31:22,916 --> 01:31:24,499
(hesitantly) Mrs Khan?

1011
01:31:24,833 --> 01:31:26,874
Oh, God! "Mrs Khan"!

1012
01:31:26,958 --> 01:31:28,915
I'll be Mrs Khan and all, soon!

1013
01:31:29,666 --> 01:31:31,749
Funny that, isn't it?
Mrs Khan number two.

1014
01:31:32,083 --> 01:31:33,915
Uh, three.

1015
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:36,290
Oh, yeah? 'Cause of, um...

1016
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:39,749
Thingmebob.

1017
01:31:47,666 --> 01:31:49,124
Very good.

1018
01:32:21,041 --> 01:32:25,665
(all cheering)

1019
01:32:47,750 --> 01:32:49,207
(indistinct)

1020
01:32:49,291 --> 01:32:52,040
(all cheering)

1021
01:32:53,708 --> 01:32:55,124
(indistinct)

1022
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:40,457
(sighing)

1023
01:35:51,791 --> 01:35:53,457
(both bidding farewell)

1024
01:35:59,583 --> 01:36:02,582
(Basheera chattering indistinctly)

1025
01:36:15,583 --> 01:36:17,082
Thank you very much.

1026
01:36:39,916 --> 01:36:41,832
Write to me, knobhead.

1027
01:36:46,333 --> 01:36:47,790
Sajid.

1028
01:36:48,458 --> 01:36:49,915
Who holds Zam-Zammah...

1029
01:36:52,750 --> 01:36:54,415
Holds the Punjab.

1030
01:37:02,375 --> 01:37:05,415
(Annie exclaiming in farewell)

1031
01:37:47,833 --> 01:37:49,332
You all right, Eunice?

1032
01:37:49,458 --> 01:37:50,915
Ah, ta.

1033
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,082
Eh, my lot can't get enough
of your kebabs, Annie.

1034
01:37:54,375 --> 01:37:56,165
Well, it's an old family recipe.

1035
01:37:58,375 --> 01:37:59,624
Isn't it, George?

1036
01:37:59,708 --> 01:38:01,124
Uh-huh.

1037
01:38:02,583 --> 01:38:04,040
Want a cup of tea?

1038
01:38:05,291 --> 01:38:06,707
I'll have a half a cup.
