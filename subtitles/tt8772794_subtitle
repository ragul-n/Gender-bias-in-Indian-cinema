1
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,666
Kabir, get out!!

2
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,708
Don't just stand there, this is'nt an
option. The bomb can go off any minute.

3
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,875
Shut up, there is no way I'm leaving
you alone.

4
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:36,708
We can use something to match
the pressure. I'll come up with something.

5
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:37,958
Stop being absurd.

6
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:42,208
This is no time to cite something like
'Even Death won't do us apart'!

7
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:46,791
- There is no way I'm leaving you alone.
- At least one of us will stay alive!

8
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,000
Think about Neeta.

9
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:52,125
About Sadiq sir...
Get out!

10
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,750
Go!

11
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:25,208
<i>"I'll never pause again.</i>

12
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:26,916
<i>Never stand still.</i>

13
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:31,000
<i>Till either death
hath closed these eyes of mine,</i>

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,791
<i>or forever give me measure of strength."</i>

15
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:48,958
Come fast. It's the bloody
Indians. I thought they were Iranians.

16
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,708
- How do you know?
- The accent.

17
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,625
- They know we're here.
- How serious is it?

18
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:58,851
They used a SIM card with fake ID. They're
communicating in codes. I have a location.

19
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,541
- Come on, move.
- Let's go!

20
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,125
Let's go. Go...

21
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,000
There is no need to break
the protocol.

22
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,708
Even Rehmat wouldn't without
a valid reason.

23
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,875
The Police don't patrol this area.
We are safe here.

24
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,541
It's always safe before
things go sideways.

25
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,375
The Police is on it's way.

26
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,166
I'll deal with them.
Go on.

27
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:14,875
On my mark...

28
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,500
Come on.

29
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,125
Come on.

30
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,375
Catch them all.

31
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,083
You have all broken the Law.

32
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,125
Do your parents know about this?

33
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,000
Hands out of your pants.

34
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,500
On your feet.
You will all be searched.

35
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,625
Come on.

36
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,458
Out... all of you.

37
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,041
They are not the Police.

38
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,083
- They know we're here.
- Yes.

39
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,250
Faster...

40
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,958
On your feet, rascal.

41
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,041
Come on.

42
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,541
That's what you get for
breaking protocols.

43
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,333
The message could have been
sent over the regular channel.

44
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,791
Breaking protocol
is also protocol.

45
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,250
It's a goldmine of information.

46
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,000
You and your big input.
We are dead for sure.

47
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,208
- Is it a nuclear attack?
- Something similar.

48
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,875
It's worth dying for.

49
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,458
What on earth is the information?

50
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,250
Whatever it is... it'll be delivered
safely to Sadiq sir.

51
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,125
These bloody infidels
will pay.

52
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,500
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

53
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:32,041
<i>You guys know about
the science of hostage rescue.</i>

54
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:35,541
today we'll talk about
the Art and the Artist.

55
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,708
How many remember the attack on
Parliament in 2001?

56
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,166
It could have been
a huge catastrophe.

57
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:45,208
And according to the media, the
Delhi Police did an amazing job.

58
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,000
But only we know the truth.

59
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,625
Adonis got there
before the police,

60
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:54,125
he secured the MPs, and he
took down three out of five terrorists.

61
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:58,375
He was trained in
thesame art as the rest of you.

62
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,125
But he is special.

63
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,875
It's pretty simple really.

64
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,333
The point is...

65
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,541
all it takes is one honest man.

66
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,125
One honest man.

67
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,541
Honest.

68
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,750
Honest to himself.
Honest about the situation.

69
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,791
Honest about the trembling in his feet.

70
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,916
Sir, what is Adonis' real name?

71
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,291
Good lecture.

72
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:38,333
The last one.
I am tendering my resignation.

73
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,708
Why? Because I didn't
disclose Adonis' real name?

74
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,083
Story narration was never on my CV.

75
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:49,083
My mission posting application
was rejected again.

76
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,184
for the fourth time.

77
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,541
What happened in
the review?

78
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:57,833
"This posting is too
sensitive for a female officer."

79
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,125
Don't take this so personally, Isha.

80
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,958
Every organization
resists changes.

81
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,416
As a female officer, it is personal, sir.

82
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,125
So... my way or highway?

83
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,875
Learn to negotiate with
your problems.

84
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,958
That's encouraging.

85
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:20,416
You are one of the sharpest analysts
we have, Isha.

86
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,458
You know it. I know it.

87
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,500
You have access to secret
documents above your clearance level.

88
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,000
Ever thought about that?

89
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,250
The Agency will never
send me on a mission.

90
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,000
I am not the Agency.

91
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,000
If you want to resign, go ahead.

92
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,916
But as long as I am here,
I won't accept this.

93
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,535
I need you here.

94
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,583
Allah be praised!

95
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,666
Indian rats! Allah be praised.

96
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:10,708
Our gift to our supreme
leader Mullah Khalid.

97
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,375
Allah is supreme.

98
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,500
Why did you call
on this number?

99
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,166
What?

100
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:43,833
<i>My gift to our supreme leader,
Mullah Khalid.</i>

101
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,625
Bastards.

102
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,041
Hassan, turn the car around.

103
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,625
<i>- Hi, Isha. Tell me.</i>
- Gita, there is nothing on it.

104
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,666
<i>Don't worry, blanks are common.</i>

105
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,666
Don't take it so lightly. Have you seen
the header? "Top Priority."

106
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,333
<i>Oh. I'll check.</i>

107
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,708
Come. Let's go.

108
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,416
Hail Commander of the Faithful!

109
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,458
Hail Commander of the Faithful!

110
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Hail Commander of the Faithful!

111
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Hail Commander of the Faithful!

112
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,250
Allah is supreme!

113
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,041
Allah is supreme!

114
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,625
Indian spies.

115
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,833
They believe...

116
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,125
they can challenge us.

117
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:23,958
But can anyone challenge the
Army of God?

118
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:27,708
No!

119
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,750
But they are not completely expendable.

120
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,916
Their blood shall serve as catalyst...

121
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,625
for our children transforming
them into men.

122
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,708
Their blood shall serve as
catalyst for our children

123
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,416
transforming them into men.

124
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,083
Into warriors!

125
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,458
Into warriors!

126
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:58,041
Allah is supreme!

127
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:02,083
Allah is supreme!

128
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:09,041
Allah is supreme!

129
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,000
Come, Shehzad.

130
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,250
And witness the word
of God be carried out.

131
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,416
Your faith and indignation
are truly admirable.

132
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:26,625
Nothing is impossible in your reign.

133
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,916
Your kingdom awaits you.

134
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,375
Welcome. Welcome.

135
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,750
- Welcome, brother.
- Thank you.

136
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,625
I request you to
stop this.

137
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,958
Is that an order?

138
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,416
Just a humble appeal.

139
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,333
Believe me...

140
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,333
I have a plan.

141
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:45,375
Come on. Get inside.

142
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,083
They are my prisoners...

143
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,208
...and I get to decide their fate.

144
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,291
Of course.

145
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:58,666
This fact cannot be denied.
Even I have a role in your quest.

146
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,000
But please don't ignore my appeal.

147
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,916
Hand over these prisoners to me.
I know exactly what to do with them.

148
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:10,416
You are just an ordinary spy.

149
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,625
An expendable soldier.

150
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,250
This is not a political ruse.

151
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:16,916
It's Jihad!

152
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,041
- Don't try to teach me.
- I am not...

153
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,708
Love is an experience
best felt personally.

154
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,625
Your anger is justified.

155
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,708
But please don't ignore
my motives either.

156
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,750
The situation is critical.

157
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,333
It was a commendable job
apprehending these spies.

158
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,833
- But I will take it from here...
- Enough!

159
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,041
I will dictate the terms.

160
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,583
Agreed. But I have a small request.

161
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,583
There will be no beheading.
Just one week...

162
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,666
Keep these Indian pests alive for a week.

163
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:16,583
And, soon the world shall witness...
your supremacy and terror.

164
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,416
So be it.

165
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,458
When the time is right.

166
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,666
But I get to decide...

167
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,708
when not you.

168
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:46,375
Face the camera!

169
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,125
Greetings.

170
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,541
<i>These Indian spies...</i>

171
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,500
TheTaliban cannot directly negotiate
with the Indian Government.

172
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,708
The Pakistan Government
won't approve of this.

173
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,583
You are just another employee
of the Pakistan Government.

174
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,000
Not the Master.

175
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,833
TheTaliban is not some group,
but a nation itself.

176
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,291
My motives are of enormous magnitude.

177
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,375
You shall be proud.

178
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,333
You will need my advice
regarding these spies.

179
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:24,416
Only a handful know the Indian
Government as intricately as I do.

180
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:29,166
For God's sake Sadiq,
don't teach me my job.

181
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:34,625
China Summit is just two weeks
away and we're still not on the same page.

182
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,125
It's very simple, sir.

183
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,041
The Chinese Premiere should
know the situation in Arunachal.

184
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,625
I know my prerogative, Sadiq!

185
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,500
I know what to
tell the PM.

186
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,250
Your annual operation spending
is being questioned.

187
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,208
Do you know that?

188
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,666
Twenty five million dollars.

189
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:01,833
Do you know that? Are we running
an agency or a small country?

190
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,416
Thankfully our budgets
are never disclosed.

191
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,000
Who is it not sitting well with, sir?

192
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,041
Do you know that?
I am the Director of Operations.

193
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,375
I'll take it up with them.

194
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,356
Do you know that? What?

195
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,375
Sorry for interrupting.

196
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,041
Isha, this better be good.

197
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,250
<i>Our Supreme Commander is a
generous man...</i>

198
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,375
<i>and he extends his generosity to
these pests...</i>

199
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,500
<i>And grants them another opportunity.</i>

200
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,458
<i>Release Ismail Sheikh, Abdul Akhmal.</i>

201
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:36,000
<i>Mehta Mansoor and Mustafa Mansar...</i>

202
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:39,125
<i>and in exchange,
you can have your little rats back.</i>

203
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,791
Who are these guys?

204
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:48,083
Samar Sharma, Kuldeep Rathod,
Aditya Kumar and that's Rehmat Khatib.

205
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,446
How did they send it?

206
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,916
The Dark Net.
Originated from Quetta...

207
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,916
The source is untraceable.

208
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,500
Thank you, Ms. Khanna. That will be all.

209
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,500
What were they doing out there?

210
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,750
They have been operating
out there for six months.

211
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:12,750
We had a lead that... the Taliban and ISA
are expandingtheir operations in this area

212
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,750
They are investigating on
my orders, sir.

213
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:17,833
But why now?

214
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,583
What is your assessment, sir?

215
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:25,416
They will keep them alive until
the Chinese Premiere lands in India...

216
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:30,041
...which will be followed
by a pubic beheading.

217
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,375
China will condemn
India and Pakistan.

218
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,875
- Crucial but predictable.
- We can't let that happen, sir.

219
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,226
There's nothing we can do.

220
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,791
Can we pay them off?

221
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,500
- That would be a trap.
- Anything else is impossible.

222
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:42,833
There's no question.

223
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:50,000
How many construction companies
in Kabul are on our payroll?

224
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,583
Two, sir.

225
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:55,041
They are not IIW agents.

226
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:01,125
They are just engineers...
kidnapped by the Taliban from Kabul.

227
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,291
Tell Kabul to file
a missing person's report.

228
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,125
Pay the agents' families...

229
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,958
and get the stories ready.

230
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:12,083
Once the beheading is done,
the stories will come out...

231
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,892
- These are our people.
- They are agents.

232
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,226
They know what they
signed up for.

233
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,416
- So we just let them die?
- "Sacrifice" is the word I would use Sadiq

234
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,666
One more thing, sir.

235
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,500
I didn't want
to say it inside.

236
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,458
That's it?

237
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:38,791
This?

238
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,500
It's a message, sir.

239
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,166
Why?
Why not just a blank?

240
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,875
No message is also a message.

241
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:51,791
This is not a message...
it's a signal for the message.

242
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,541
Our agents have stumbled
upon something huge.

243
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,041
A high-grade file
now may or may not follow.

244
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:01,083
Maybe we won't receive
any more information.

245
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,125
But our boys are in
grave danger, Isha.

246
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:09,250
And they have to be rescued now,
at all costs.

247
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,500
Are you ready, Isha?

248
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,166
To go on a mission?

249
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,375
Off the books.

250
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,541
- You want me to...
- Yes.

251
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:29,791
Get Adonis for me.

252
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,583
Only he can get
our boys back.

253
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,166
But he won't talk to me.

254
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,333
Bad blood.

255
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:51,458
And his real
name?

256
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,166
Kabir Anand.

257
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:01,291
<i>'He was like a son...</i>

258
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,208
<i>but we don't share
that bond anymore.</i>

259
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,000
<i>I trained him personally, but...</i>

260
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:11,375
<i>our work came between us...</i>

261
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:13,500
<i>and destroyed everything.</i>

262
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:22,791
<i>"Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,</i>

263
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:25,083
<i>Creeps in this petty pace</i>

264
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,166
<i>from day to day,</i>

265
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:28,833
<i>To the last syllable of recorded time;</i>

266
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:32,250
<i>And all our yesterdays have lighted fools</i>

267
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,125
<i>The way to dusty death.</i>

268
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,250
<i>Out, out, brief candle!</i>

269
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:42,416
Life's but a walking shadow,
a poor player,

270
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,750
That struts
and frets his hour upon the stage,

271
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:49,000
And then is heard no more. It is a tale

272
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:52,541
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,

273
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:54,000
Signifying

274
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:55,666
nothing."

275
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:05,583
Morning, Rohan.

276
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,166
Am I boring you?

277
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:09,666
Sorry, Sir. No.

278
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,833
Say it when you mean it.

279
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,666
Shakespeare tires me, Sir.

280
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:17,333
I don't know why we study him.
I don't see any point, Sir.

281
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:20,416
I'm surprised you see any point
in coming to school.

282
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:24,708
I mean no disrespect,
but when I was your age,

283
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:27,375
I didn't get the point of school at all.

284
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:30,125
Thankfully, I am no longer your age.

285
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:34,958
My defense of the Bard
will bore you more than the Bard.

286
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,458
And frankly, he needs no defense.

287
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:39,583
- Will you do something for me?
- Yeah, Sir.

288
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:43,041
Ask yourself, "Why are you resisting
Shakespeare so much?

289
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:46,625
And why is this boredom so relaxing
that you fall asleep?"

290
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:48,166
Sit down.

291
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:00,375
When did this happen?

292
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,291
And you're calling me now.

293
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:05,875
Yeah?

294
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:09,541
I am on my way.

295
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,750
Sikandar.
Backseat, now.

296
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:01,875
Uncle, it's my birthday.

297
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:04,791
Please, think of it like that

298
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:07,333
Just 12 more birthdays
before you get to drive.

299
00:26:07,541 --> 00:26:08,601
Think of it like that. Go on.

300
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:10,125
Now hop on.

301
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:12,958
Good boy.

302
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:20,375
Who goes to the hospital
on their birthday?

303
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:21,958
How do you know?

304
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:24,375
Can't I pick you up otherwise?

305
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,250
I know. I am not a kid anymore.

306
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,041
Uncle, why are you
taking a different route?

307
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:23,000
Where did they go?

308
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:33,166
Kabir.
Please wait outside.

309
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:34,333
I'll see you.

310
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:36,375
Neeta is stable now.

311
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:37,833
She needs some rest.

312
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,833
<i>'"This friendship</i>

313
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:55,750
<i>is inseparable."</i>

314
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,875
- Separable or inseparable?
- Inseparable.

315
00:27:57,958 --> 00:28:04,666
<i>"Even if we embrace death..."</i>

316
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,267
- I don't know.
- Oh man, I suck at this.

317
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:07,601
- Why do you keep stopping?
- I forgot the lyrics.

318
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:08,541
- Let go?
- Let go.

319
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:11,392
You know what? I am the odd one
out here. I feel I am the odd

320
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:12,416
Come on.

321
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:14,416
And we love odd ones.

322
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:21,083
Kabir.

323
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,375
She's out of danger now.
But she needs rest.

324
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:28,791
Any new tests or medication?

325
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,666
No.

326
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,958
The problem is clear.

327
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:35,458
Neeta's mental state
is affecting her body.

328
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:38,333
Her blood pressure dropped
today and she fainted.

329
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,083
Last time, her potassium was low.

330
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:45,125
- Can I see her?
- Yeah, sure.

331
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,750
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Yeah.

332
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,958
- Who is that?
- Spiderman.

333
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:31,833
Why didn't you call?

334
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:35,750
Because I was in no mood
for another one of your lectures.

335
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:37,708
And especially not in this condition.

336
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:41,375
This is no place for Sikander
to spend his birthday.

337
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:43,625
You have to be strong.

338
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:49,916
You really believe that
I like losing consciousness.

339
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:51,708
No, Kabir.

340
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,000
Look at yourself before telling me.

341
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:58,416
This isn't about me.

342
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:03,083
Your face scares me.

343
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:08,750
You never want to talk about Vikram.

344
00:30:11,916 --> 00:30:13,583
I'm trying to move on.

345
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,240
You don't let me.

346
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:30,875
Call from Delhi.

347
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,500
Come with us.

348
00:30:57,958 --> 00:31:01,125
Will you come quietly
or do we have to persuade you?

349
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:02,916
Whoever sent you...

350
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,708
didn't tell you

351
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:08,500
what I can do.

352
00:33:06,541 --> 00:33:08,625
- How is he?
- Dazed.

353
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:10,875
Does he know?

354
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:12,958
Wouldn't listen.

355
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:43,833
You have a twisted sense of timing.

356
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:49,666
Do you know what
day is it today?

357
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:51,708
It's Sikandar's birthday.

358
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:56,083
Neeta's already been informed.

359
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:58,333
She's there with him at home now.

360
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,208
Five years.

361
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:10,250
You've changed.

362
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:12,958
But you haven't changed at all.

363
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:16,458
Can't you take a hint?

364
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:20,958
- I want to be left alone.
- Alright, relax.

365
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,500
"Relax."

366
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:26,083
After you had me
kidnapped.

367
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:28,208
The situation is desperate, Kabir.

368
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,125
I had no other options.

369
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:32,458
It's your problem if you're desperate.

370
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:33,875
I'm not the answer.

371
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:36,625
- No time for a conversation.
<i>- </i>Fine.

372
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,333
Then I'll show myself out.

373
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:41,791
Four of our agents were
captured in Balochistan by the Taliban.

374
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,958
Adonis, they need you.

375
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:53,041
One of them sent this
before getting captured.

376
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,500
Remember...

377
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:02,500
It's a huge input.

378
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:05,375
They stumbled upon something really big.

379
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:07,833
I want you to rescue them.

380
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:08,958
They deserve a shot.

381
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:13,708
Vikram?

382
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:16,000
He didn't deserve anything?

383
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:20,125
Dishonourable discharge even
after he died in the line of duty.

384
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:21,416
Have you no shame?

385
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:23,333
Here you go.

386
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:24,750
End it right now.

387
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,166
Make your peace, Kabir.

388
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,250
Come on.

389
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:42,291
You must return
to Balochistan.

390
00:35:42,416 --> 00:35:43,750
For what?

391
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:46,500
Four more deaths to my name?

392
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:50,041
- No, thank you.
- Stop feeling guilty for Vikram, Kabir.

393
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:53,125
Someone has to
swallow this bitter pill.

394
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:20,083
Yes?

395
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:23,500
I am on official business.

396
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,333
You are not my boss.

397
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:30,250
Then why ask such absurd questions?

398
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:33,083
Yes.

399
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:34,666
Come in.

400
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,250
I'll be back in two days.

401
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:38,708
Bye.

402
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:41,625
Sir, we recovered
this from one of the infidels.

403
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:46,375
You should have brought it to me earlier.

404
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:47,458
Leave.

405
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,125
Fuck!

406
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:44,416
Can't you take a hint?

407
00:38:44,541 --> 00:38:46,875
<i>Fate has a twisted sense
of timing, Kabir.</i>

408
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,291
You have been
deceived.

409
00:38:49,916 --> 00:38:51,333
<i>Spare me the suspense.</i>

410
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,750
The input has arrived.

411
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:58,208
<i>I've decrypted a part of it...
and the rest is in process.</i>

412
00:38:58,291 --> 00:39:00,083
You were right.

413
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:01,500
As always.

414
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:04,666
I know who murdered Vikramjeet.

415
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:09,875
And it's not you.

416
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,083
The answers we seek are in Balochistan.

417
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:18,333
<i>I just don't know who
to trust anymore. Except you.</i>

418
00:39:18,416 --> 00:39:20,458
You're playing mind
games with me again.

419
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:25,208
ID, please.

420
00:39:40,583 --> 00:39:41,750
Your boarding pass.

421
00:39:42,916 --> 00:39:44,875
Sorry, I'm not travelling today.

422
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:52,166
<i>Why were you and Vikramjeet
in Balochistan?</i>

423
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:55,125
Investigating the death
of agent Karan Bhushan...

424
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:58,333
who was serving in Balochistan
as an Indian Diplomat.

425
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,583
His murder...

426
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:02,250
was the handiwork of a mole in our system.

427
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:03,684
What about the defector?

428
00:40:03,708 --> 00:40:05,458
Sir, I've given a written statement.

429
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:08,416
This enquiry is for you to come clean
on everything, Mr. Kabir Anand.

430
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,101
Frankly, sir, I don't think
you're interested in the truth.

431
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:13,500
Oh, you mean your version.

432
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:19,333
He was a
Talibani... who knew about the mole.

433
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:23,125
He wanted our help to defect to America
in exchange for information.

434
00:40:23,208 --> 00:40:25,083
He had intel that they
could use.

435
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,250
We...

436
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:28,583
I spoke to Sadiq about this.

437
00:40:28,791 --> 00:40:31,833
Did Sadiq Sheikh grant
permission to you and Vikramjeet

438
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:33,666
to get the defector out?

439
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:39,208
- Yes, sir.
- I was told it was a non-combat mission.

440
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:42,083
Sir, I'm a hostage rescue specialist.
Combat or no combat.

441
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:44,791
The Talibani got paranoid
and shut himself in a madrasa.

442
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:46,458
It was an in-and-out job.

443
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:49,916
Vikramjeet died.

444
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:55,291
I'm to blame, sir.

445
00:40:56,416 --> 00:40:57,416
We were set up.

446
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:00,625
Someone knew we were coming.

447
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:03,208
Otherwise...

448
00:41:04,916 --> 00:41:07,458
those explosives wouldn't have been there.

449
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:10,291
Kabir, someone knew
of our mole.

450
00:41:11,291 --> 00:41:13,375
You and your partner screwed it up.

451
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:17,125
Sir, I don't think it is fair
to cast such aspersions.

452
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:20,541
- The operation was botched up, but...
- Can you give this in writing, Sadiq?

453
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:24,041
No, you can't.

454
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:27,958
Your clearance was limited
only to an investigation.

455
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,875
You know that we
were instigated.

456
00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:33,642
- It was a trap.
- Things are just not adding up, Kabir.

457
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:37,333
I keep saying over and over
again that we have a mole in our agency.

458
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:40,258
- But you guys don't understand.
- Maybe there is no mole.

459
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:42,583
Maybe you're just getting emotional.

460
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:44,500
Misread the situation.

461
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:46,541
Typical star behavior.

462
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:52,083
- Sir, I've always been honest.
- Without integrity, I'm afraid.

463
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:54,208
Mr. Kabir Anand,

464
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:58,875
you are herewith discharged dishonorably
from all your duties.

465
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:02,125
Your colleague
will get the same treatment.

466
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:05,500
Kindly deposit all the material
that you may have of the Agency.

467
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:07,916
Sir, where is your sense of justice?

468
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:14,416
Be glad we are not prosecuting
or neutralizing you.

469
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:17,708
That is a favor.

470
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:31,208
Sir?

471
00:43:38,541 --> 00:43:39,541
Sadiq, sir?
