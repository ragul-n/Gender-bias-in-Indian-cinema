<i>Well the thing is...</i>

00:01:36,912 --> 00:01:39,560
<i>We'd generally assume that
planetary movements, constellations,</i>

5
00:01:39,953 --> 00:01:45,773
<i>days of week, nature of timings,
money, fate etc control our lives.</i>

<i>If we don't live properly,</i>

7
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:52,311

ignore will bring doom to us.</i>

<i>The common point here is that</i>

15
00:02:13,703 --> 00:02:16,062
<i>the one who spelt doom in the lives
of these three people is the same cop.</i>

16

-We have permission.
-What sort of permission?

20
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:46,947
We have a permission letter
of the Central Home Minister.

21
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:53,987
The person who we are going to
interview now is not an ordinary person.

22
00:02:54,205 --> 00:02:57,922
He is the most wanted criminal who
terrorised India at one point of time.

23
00:02:58,665 --> 00:03:01,054
He got acquainted with
anti-social elements when he was ten.

24
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:05,260
He got a special position in
Mumbai Mafia world at the age of 25.

25
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:08,694
He was involved in the serial bomb blasts
that took place in Mumbai 15 years ago.

26
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,656
After that, he got caught by the
police in the most unexpected manner.

27
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:14,855
He is none other than the most
wanted criminal Saleem Bhatkal.

28

Shall we start the interview?

29
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:40,010

I need to be paid.

Saleem Bhatkal is asking for money.

-Five lakhs?
-Uhuh.

Uhuh.

44
00:04:15,644 --> 00:04:16,414
Five crores?

45

Fifty rupees.

46

One minute.

50
00:04:26,997 --> 00:04:27,869
Do you have fifty rupees?

51
00:04:28,092 --> 00:04:29,161
I don't, madam.

52
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:30,390
Madam...

53
00:04:37,925 --> 00:04:41,825
I, who used to rule Mumbai from
Dubai with a single phone call,

54
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:45,705
am now sitting in this jail
incapable of doing anything.

55
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,759

This freaking fifty rupees!

your arrival from Mumbai.

I will handle every task
that you need in Kurnool.

Please come, boss. Come.

68
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:51,293
Take some rest. All the food
arrangements will be made.

69
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,115

You have already obtained
20 passports on this address.

The officer inside is newly
appointed. He is very strict.

Bring the documents with a new address.

83
00:06:32,761 --> 00:06:35,142
Come, sir.
This is the house I mentioned about.

84
00:06:35,554 --> 00:06:36,867
Have you told him
about all our conditions?

85
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:39,250
As if this is an auction
to tell that every time.

86
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,323
The rent is 5000 rupees
with a six months advance.

87
00:06:41,523 --> 00:06:44,386
And there is an addition of 50 rupees
on electricity bill from this month.

88
00:06:44,848 --> 00:06:45,650
Why the additional 50 rupees?

89
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,868
You come up with some catch
every time I'm here with a party?

90
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,794
He can take it if it's fine, else quit!

91
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:51,069
Hey, it's a matter of my reputation.

92
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:53,231
Huh? A mere broker
talking about reputation?

93
00:06:53,431 --> 00:06:53,910
Please stop.

94
00:06:54,097 --> 00:06:55,407

95
00:06:55,607 --> 00:06:57,118
-Hey, how dare you lay hand on me!
-Hey Mastan, what's that mess.

96
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:57,929
Leave that.

-Why are going overboard?

To hell with his house!
His house is unworthy.

102
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,183
The house in front of us is
having a better Vastu than this.

103
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:08,528
Come, I'll get that for you.

104
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:10,740
What is the bloody fuss
for just fifty rupees?

105
00:07:11,187 --> 00:07:12,143
Let's go.

106
00:07:13,116 --> 00:07:15,048
I am giving the house to you.
You can do house warming tomorrow.

107
00:07:15,248 --> 00:07:16,072
Okay.

Yes, now the address is perfect.

110

You have been searching for
four days for Saleem Bhatkal.

111
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:29,669
Do you think he is still in India?

112
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:31,707
There is no chance for
him to cross the border.

113
00:07:32,396 --> 00:07:35,644
Saleem Bhatkal can't
escape the police this time.

114
00:07:36,046 --> 00:07:39,794
No matter how big the criminal is,
he is bound to commit some petty mistake.

115
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:44,972
And there would be a diligent police
officer who would trace that mistake.

00:08:57,773 --> 00:08:59,133
she'd make me and the
kid wear the same color,

00:08:59,226 --> 00:09:00,249
make me carry boxes,

129

-Yes, dad.

Dad says that mom!

132
00:09:05,492 --> 00:09:07,253
You shouldn't speak
like that at the temple.

133
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:08,403
That's a sin!

134
00:09:08,753 --> 00:09:10,870
Put those boxes down
and seek forgiveness.

135
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:16,011
Ah!

136
00:09:16,363 --> 00:09:18,705
It's the same menu, Acharya.
It's the same Pulihora (lemon rice).

137
00:09:19,098 --> 00:09:21,975
I think you have added more
cashew nuts and raisins this time.

138

You make super tasty dishes, madam.

139

What, kiddo?

141
00:09:26,404 --> 00:09:29,797
It was you who got up at 4 am and
made Pulihora (lemon rice), didn't you?

142
00:09:30,197 --> 00:09:31,580
But why are they giving all credit to mom?

143
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,764
Hey, don't be loud.
She might feel bad if she overhears.

144
00:09:34,168 --> 00:09:37,016
I too would get hurt if you were
made to look weak in public, dad.

-Well its nothing.

your words as per the situation.

here, you are supporting me.

become a great politician.

No, dad. I would become only a cap.

-Yes.

The area on this side of the road falls
under two town police station limits

town station limits. Don't you know?

00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:49,186
All our passports get
managed in that station.

176
00:10:49,386 --> 00:10:51,178
But now, someone from One Town
station would come for enquiry.

177
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,821
Well it's a cop there too?
Manage it somehow.

178
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,315
Okay, sir.

179
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:58,983
What was the bloody fuss
for just fifty rupees?

180
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,223
Good morning.

181
00:11:08,628 --> 00:11:10,003
Are you bidding
farewell or doing a salute?

182
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,711
Come on, sir. We don't need
these formalities between us.

183
00:11:11,961 --> 00:11:12,705
Hey!

184
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:15,700
I've been doing the police job to get
salutes, but not for the sake of salary.

185
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,579
Okay, sir.

186
00:11:16,739 --> 00:11:17,469
That's it!

187
00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:19,270
My salute is to you and
your salary is for me, sir.

188
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:20,466
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

189
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:21,611
Good morning, sir.

190
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:25,265
-Subba Rao...
-Yes, sir.

191
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:26,603
-Where is Mr. Raju?
-He didn't come yet, sir.

192
00:11:26,703 --> 00:11:27,902
Didn't turn up yet?

193
00:11:28,744 --> 00:11:30,000
How come he didn't come yet?

194
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:31,398
Generally, he would have
been here by this time.

195
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,931
Yes... Welcome, Mr. Raju.

196
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:37,826
The station loses it's
charisma without you.

197
00:11:38,226 --> 00:11:39,714
How can you be late, Mr. Raju?

198
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:41,684
Trying to get habituated to my home, sir.

199
00:11:42,225 --> 00:11:44,670
Because I have to be at
home from tomorrow, sir.

200
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:48,802
I am about to retire, sir.

201
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,091
For 33 years...

202
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:55,631
My living got accustomed
to complaints, reporting,

203
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,544
enquiries and transfers, sir.

204
00:11:59,175 --> 00:12:02,171
My wife and children too would
seem to me like pending cases.

205
00:12:03,176 --> 00:12:07,309
Without the uniform,
I feel I am in a disguise.

206
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:09,374
And it will be like that till my death.

207
00:12:09,925 --> 00:12:14,278
A strange feeling of being pushed
out from my house, sir.

208
00:12:17,973 --> 00:12:19,273
Mr. Raju, come.

209
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:23,906
Sit... please sit.

210
00:12:26,687 --> 00:12:27,704
Mr. Raju.

211
00:12:29,109 --> 00:12:31,094
Retirement means a paid rest.

212
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:34,668
Once a cop, always a cop till death.

213
00:12:35,391 --> 00:12:36,525
This is your station.

214
00:12:36,725 --> 00:12:37,833
You can come here anytime you want.

215
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:41,993
Share your 33 years of experience
with us and be our support, Mr. Raju.

216
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:43,859
We'd feel very happy.

217
00:12:45,418 --> 00:12:46,503
Okay?

218
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:03,329
Mom...

219
00:13:03,772 --> 00:13:04,812
What's the matter, Chinku?

220
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,355
Mom...

221
00:13:06,981 --> 00:13:08,152
What's the matter, dear?

222
00:13:08,911 --> 00:13:10,846
What, dear? Want to drink Boost?

223
00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:11,675
No.

224
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:12,978
-Horlicks then?
-No.

225
00:13:13,178 --> 00:13:14,261
Then, what do you want?

226
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,844
I slept between both of you last night.

227
00:13:17,816 --> 00:13:19,862
But how come I woke up in
the hall, in the morning?

228
00:13:23,788 --> 00:13:24,856
Ask your father.

229
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,056
[takes deep breath] Hmm...

230
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:29,270
-Dad...
-Yes, dear.

231
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:30,802
-Dad!
-Don't scare me.

232
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:33,588
Er... well, it's called somnambulism.

233
00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:36,501
Somnambulism? What does it mean?

234
00:13:36,972 --> 00:13:38,047
Sleepwalking, son!

235
00:13:38,288 --> 00:13:39,447
-Eh?
-Yeah!

236
00:13:39,647 --> 00:13:40,880
Well, you indeed, slept between us.

237
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,650
But you've sleepwalked to here and slept.

238
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,752
I won't believe you.

239
00:13:43,952 --> 00:13:46,030
You have to believe me.
That's our hereditary disease.

240
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,620
It has passed from my
grandfather to my father.

241
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,804
And from my father, it passed to me,

242
00:13:49,004 --> 00:13:49,932
and from me, it got passed to you.

243
00:13:50,032 --> 00:13:52,924
And you'd pass somnambulism
to your kid as well, you young devil!

244
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,761
-Is it?
-Yes, dear.

245
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:57,169
Yeah, your smiles!

246
00:13:58,478 --> 00:14:01,482
Well, I woke up in the hall.
But where did you wake up?

247
00:14:02,782 --> 00:14:04,836
Whoa! Son of a cop!

248
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:05,876
Too many doubts.

249
00:14:06,076 --> 00:14:07,251
-Get ready. It's time to go to school
-Stop it!

250
00:14:07,351 --> 00:14:08,600
Dad, behave yourself.

251
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,431
Whoa! Come on! Make it fast!

252
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:13,373
Hey Cheeku, come here.

253
00:14:16,385 --> 00:14:18,346
Where did you meet him, mom?

254
00:14:18,446 --> 00:14:20,667
He's been passing his diseases to me.

255
00:14:22,423 --> 00:14:25,395
Do you know how your
father came into my life?

256
00:14:25,511 --> 00:14:26,207
How?

257
00:14:26,787 --> 00:14:27,577
-Shankar...
-Yes.

258
00:14:28,165 --> 00:14:29,277
-Shankar...
-What is it?

259
00:14:29,377 --> 00:14:31,369
We should be generally having a whisky.

260
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:32,679
But what's with these Yoga asanas?

261
00:14:33,356 --> 00:14:36,556
Mental fitness is a must along with
physical fitness, for police training

262
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:38,467
and Yoga is very much
needed for that. Come, guys.

263
00:14:38,721 --> 00:14:39,663
Hmm...

264
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,548
-Who's this rum bottle-looking guy?
-Looking fresh?

265
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,841
What did you see to tell
that? How did you know?

266
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,911
Because you have come to
do Yoga wearing Lungis.

267
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,998
Do you mean we shouldn't
do Yoga wearing Lungis?

268
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:50,636
Of course, you can, but it'd be
unbearable for others to watch you.

269
00:14:51,386 --> 00:14:52,700
Are you well versed with the postures?

270
00:14:53,238 --> 00:14:55,831
We know about the addictions,
but not the postures.

271
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,021
-For brats like you...
-Hey...

272
00:14:58,453 --> 00:15:00,454
For beginners like you,

273
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,942
there is a class over there. Join them.

274
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:05,388
Pleasurable nights and
morning Yoga in whites.

275
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,695
Lucky chaps!

276
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,488
As if we don't!

277
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:11,273
Let's not get into this.
Let's do our own Asanas.

278
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,136
Ramana, try that posture.

279
00:15:13,922 --> 00:15:14,952
Mahesh, you try this posture.

280
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:17,429
Hey, you try that.

281
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:18,530
Okay. Nice.

282
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:19,758
Hello, jingle...

283
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,204
Hey! Not her! The posture behind!

284
00:15:22,562 --> 00:15:24,363
-Oh this?
-Watch it carefully.

285
00:15:25,082 --> 00:15:28,339
I... He seems good.
I will try this posture.

286
00:15:30,844 --> 00:15:31,800
He is confident.

287
00:15:35,224 --> 00:15:36,607
He's asking me to do this posture.

288
00:15:36,707 --> 00:15:39,823
This girl has raised her legs
up and I am in a lungi.

289
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:40,834
What if someone watches?

290
00:15:41,034 --> 00:15:42,801
Who cares? It's their problem.

291
00:15:45,936 --> 00:15:46,861
Ow!

292
00:15:47,861 --> 00:15:50,194
Wow! Look at him.

293
00:15:50,507 --> 00:15:51,694
I don't think even Baba Ramdev

294
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,868
would've made a Yoga posture for so
long like this in a disciplined manner.

295
00:15:55,229 --> 00:15:56,070
He is a genius.

296
00:15:57,077 --> 00:15:58,363
[groans]

297
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:06,359
Your pose is outstanding!

298
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:08,983
It is not outstanding. I got stuck!

299
00:16:09,388 --> 00:16:10,127
Got stuck?

300
00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:11,487
This is foolishness.

301
00:16:11,687 --> 00:16:14,403
-Hey, he got stuck. Come here, quick.
-Got stuck?

302
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,974
-Slowly. Careful.
-One shouldn't go overboard!

303
00:16:18,398 --> 00:16:20,628
-Hey... Hey...
-Come and check him.

304
00:16:20,963 --> 00:16:22,313
-Stop... Stop...
-[groans]

305
00:16:22,804 --> 00:16:25,804
If you release it in an improper manner,
the main organ would get damaged.

306
00:16:25,904 --> 00:16:27,059
-You mean...
-Yeah, that of course.

307
00:16:28,014 --> 00:16:30,100
-Oh man!
-Isn't there someone who can rescue him?

308
00:16:30,253 --> 00:16:31,318
This is awareness.

309
00:16:36,601 --> 00:16:37,878
She is the solution.

310
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:40,184
She is the epitome of Yoga.

311
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:43,553
What happened?

312
00:16:44,151 --> 00:16:46,038
He got excited and went too far!

313
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:46,598
Hmm.

314
00:16:46,856 --> 00:16:47,623
Okay.

315
00:16:47,902 --> 00:16:49,590
-What will you do, ma'am?
-Sir, please...

316
00:17:02,018 --> 00:17:02,460
[groans]

317
00:17:03,037 --> 00:17:03,851
Thank God!

318
00:17:09,287 --> 00:17:11,518
You shouldn't try things directly.

319
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,847
You've got to take it step by step.

320
00:17:15,542 --> 00:17:16,240
Okay?

321
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:18,232
I will start from tomorrow.

322
00:17:18,432 --> 00:17:20,095
Oh! Tomorrow?

323
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:22,164
-Yeah.
-Okay.

324
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:26,892
"Hey beautiful damsel,
I've fallen in love for the first time"

325
00:17:27,092 --> 00:17:31,700
"Shall we start dating and go
around the parks in the city?"

326
00:17:32,116 --> 00:17:36,919
"Her looks and attire blow my mind!"

327
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:41,480
"Her sheer dress sense
makes me go bonkers!"

328
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:46,490
"Her kindness and tender
beauty blow my mind away"

329
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:51,050
"Her style makes me go crazy!"

330
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:55,934
"You've amazingly come
into my life, sweetie!"

331
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,982
"You've amazingly come
into my life, sweetie!"

332
00:18:00,985 --> 00:18:04,905
"You've amazingly come
into my life, sweetie!"

333
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:09,804
"You've amazingly come
into my life, sweetie!"

334
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,510
"Her looks and attire blow my mind!"

335
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,148
"Her sheer dress sense
makes me go bonkers!"

336
00:18:52,748 --> 00:18:53,730
"I love it!"

337
00:18:53,814 --> 00:18:58,102
"Hey beautiful damsel,
I've fallen in love for the first time"

338
00:18:58,325 --> 00:19:03,245
"Shall we start dating and go
around the parks in the city?"

339
00:19:03,258 --> 00:19:06,988
"I've stopped eating..."

340
00:19:12,774 --> 00:19:17,542
"I've stopped eating,
lost in your thoughts"

341
00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:22,242
"I've been looking at you
stealthily in my dreams"

342
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:27,156
"I've been following you for miles"

343
00:19:27,187 --> 00:19:29,530
"I've been with you forgetting myself"

344
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:34,158
"since the day I met you!"

345
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:39,229
"You've amazingly come
into my life, sweetie!"

346
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:43,203
"You've amazingly come
into my life, sweetie!"

347
00:19:44,155 --> 00:19:48,827
"You've amazingly come
into my life, sweetie!"

348
00:19:48,934 --> 00:19:53,138
"You've amazingly come into my life,

I have unlocked your
father in that manner,

350
00:20:39,516 --> 00:20:41,881
and he has locked me
up with him with love.

351
00:20:41,981 --> 00:20:43,081
Is it, mom?

352
00:20:43,244 --> 00:20:44,529
Hey kiddo, it is getting late.

353
00:20:44,629 --> 00:20:46,101
If you are done with your
mother-son stories, we'll make a move.

354
00:20:46,338 --> 00:20:47,399
Yeah, I know.

355
00:20:47,557 --> 00:20:48,765
What do you know?

356
00:20:48,965 --> 00:20:50,999
How come you took advantage of her
innocence and make her fall for you?

357
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,634
I am the one who is
innocent, not your mom.

358
00:20:52,896 --> 00:20:55,118
The bus is waiting. Come on, start.

Bye.

362
00:21:00,505 --> 00:21:01,581
Bye, darling.

363
00:21:10,032 --> 00:21:11,353
Subba Rao, what happened?

364
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:12,456
The scooter doesn't start.

365
00:21:13,124 --> 00:21:13,813
Headed to the station?

366
00:21:13,913 --> 00:21:15,421
There is a passport enquiry
at Sulemanpeta, sir.

367
00:21:15,698 --> 00:21:17,123
It is on the way.
Let's finish the task en-route.

368
00:21:17,273 --> 00:21:18,441
-Okay, sir.
-Umm.

369
00:21:21,886 --> 00:21:23,602
Here is house no. 8-2-167.

370
00:21:23,642 --> 00:21:24,882
This is Satyanarayana's house.

371
00:21:25,081 --> 00:21:26,258
Oh! Okay.

372
00:21:27,497 --> 00:21:28,747
-Well... finish your task and come.
-Okay, sir.

373
00:21:35,997 --> 00:21:36,905
I am here for Passport enquiry.

374
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:37,966
Okay. Come in, sir.

375
00:21:38,251 --> 00:21:39,283
Please sit.

376
00:21:43,022 --> 00:21:45,133
-Are you Mr. Satyanarayana?
-Yes, sir.

377
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:47,733
What about Mrs. Annapoorna?

378
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:49,506
Annapoorna...

379
00:21:51,138 --> 00:21:51,918
Here, she is.

380
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,346
-Greetings, sir.
-Greetings.

How come you called so soon, darling?
Missing me?

[Telugu song playing on radio]

00:22:06,657 --> 00:22:10,194
Darling, do you have white
saree with black lining?

386
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,197
Yes, I have it.

387
00:22:12,704 --> 00:22:14,712
You have it! Do something.

388
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,438
Get it ready for
tonight... What do you say?

389
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:19,200
Okay.

390
00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:21,779
Oh!

391
00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:23,851
-Sorry lady. I didn't notice.
-Give me one.

392
00:22:24,905 --> 00:22:25,968
Mwah!

393
00:22:26,735 --> 00:22:28,533
Mwah! Bye.

394
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:30,709
Hey Subba Rao, are you done?

395
00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:31,626
Yeah, coming, sir.

396
00:22:33,387 --> 00:22:34,413
-Shall we go?
-Yes, sir.

397
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,960
How dare you to sell black tickets
that too for Shakeela's movie?

398
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,888
-Sir.
-We didn't even watch it till now.

399
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,995
Selling black tickets eh?
Come on, hit them.

400
00:22:46,095 --> 00:22:49,389
Men attend the screening of Shakeela's
movies without their wives' knowledge.

401
00:22:49,552 --> 00:22:51,787
And you've done an injustice to
them by inflating the ticket price.

402
00:22:51,987 --> 00:22:53,093
Bash them, Mr. Ramesh.

403
00:22:54,256 --> 00:22:57,757
Burqa? With a face that resembles a burqa,
you sell black tickets in burkhas!

404
00:22:58,635 --> 00:23:00,797
If I ever see you in a burqa,

405
00:23:00,897 --> 00:23:03,741
I will kill you. How dare
you sell black tickets?

406

00:23:11,248 --> 00:23:12,015

00:23:12,285 --> 00:23:13,191
Sir...

409
00:23:13,924 --> 00:23:15,865
What is the name of the person
in your passport enquiry?

410
00:23:16,115 --> 00:23:16,894
Satyanarayana, sir.

411
00:23:16,965 --> 00:23:18,478
Then, how come a burqa
was taken to his home?

412
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,633
Burqa?

413
00:23:20,363 --> 00:23:21,580
I didn't observe that, sir.

414
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:23,728
Subba Rao, summon the laundress.

415
00:23:23,831 --> 00:23:24,416
OK, sir.

416
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:27,145
Come on, sir.
I can never make that mistake.

417
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:28,487
Those clothes belongs to them, sir.

418
00:23:31,015 --> 00:23:32,100
How long since you known them?

419
00:23:32,385 --> 00:23:34,469
Not even a week since they
have occupied that house, sir.

420
00:23:35,048 --> 00:23:36,860
They said they've been
staying there since six months, sir.

421
00:23:37,129 --> 00:23:38,149
We've been here since six months.

422
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:40,145
Moreover, their gas and
electricity bill were authentic.

423
00:23:40,363 --> 00:23:42,588
The problem is not with the bill,
but with the burqa, Subba Rao.

424
00:23:43,414 --> 00:23:45,869
Hello, Mr Satyanarayana. May I come in?

425
00:23:46,069 --> 00:23:46,635
You...

426
00:23:46,835 --> 00:23:48,162
You have applied for
passport, haven't you?

427
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,935
But the passport enquiry was done!

428
00:23:49,979 --> 00:23:52,509
There are no limits for cop enquiry
and a crazy guy's first night, sire!

429
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:53,860
It might happen any number of times.

430
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,015
Whoa! All our Gods are here.

431
00:23:58,362 --> 00:24:00,872
Seems like Mr Satyanarayana
is very religious.

432
00:24:01,112 --> 00:24:03,082
You have filled the entire
wall with deity's posters.

433
00:24:03,282 --> 00:24:04,408
Oh! Mrs Annapoorna.

434
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,069
You seem very
traditional just like your name.

435
00:24:06,132 --> 00:24:08,418
Will you please give me a glass of
cool water with your sacred hands?

436
00:24:08,618 --> 00:24:09,980
-Okay.
-Wow! What a culture!

437
00:24:09,994 --> 00:24:12,619
You have managed everything
very well, but...

438
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:16,465
Wonder what's with this burqa?

439
00:24:17,784 --> 00:24:20,971
I am asking you, Mr Satyanarayana.
What's with this burqa?

440
00:24:22,755 --> 00:24:25,911
You came for an enquiry. Take as much
amount as you want and bugger off.

441
00:24:26,022 --> 00:24:27,138
How much amount will you pay?

442
00:24:27,836 --> 00:24:28,606
Two.

443
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:30,207
Come on, two is very cheap.

444
00:24:31,163 --> 00:24:31,788
Five.

445
00:24:32,342 --> 00:24:33,493
Thousands or lakhs?

446
00:24:33,508 --> 00:24:37,583
Hey... Do you know Saleem Bhatkal?

447
00:24:37,867 --> 00:24:39,958
Who is he? Is he the tailor
who stitched this burqa?

448
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:41,060
Hey...

449
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:43,973
Do you know my background?

What a shame!
Annapoorna has become Gun-poorna.

00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,321
Let's talk about your background!

454
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:20,557
-Subba Rao, handle Gun-poorna.
-Okay, sir.

to know your background?

Come on, show it to me.

Come on.

And it triggered my boss's anger.

him the special soda.

want me to make you try another soda?

hate and I have bashed him up.

is none other than Saleem Bhatkal,

-Yes, dear.

Well, I couldn't recognise
because of his clean shaved face, sir.

489

If Satyanarayana is Saleem
Bhatkal... then, who is this Annapoorna?

Oh no! She is not Annapoorna,
but heroine Deepthi Bedi.

Can you explain your plan of action?

503

Well, I did as per my SP's instructions.

504
00:27:45,102 --> 00:27:46,599
The whole credit goes to him.

505
00:27:46,656 --> 00:27:48,726
He was the one who devised
the plan and the plan of action.

506
00:27:49,115 --> 00:27:51,165
The gun belongs to him and he was
the one who pulled the trigger.

I just worked like a bullet. That's it.

I am a die-hard fan of SP.

509
00:27:56,171 --> 00:27:57,475
He is my inspiration.

510
00:27:57,527 --> 00:27:59,764
He is the reason for my current position.

511
00:28:01,136 --> 00:28:01,735

It made me a joker and
made me sit in front of you.

Can I ask you something, off the record?

516

Yes.

What do you intend to do to Shankar?

518
00:28:22,811 --> 00:28:24,853
I want to come out of prison and kill him.

you have come to jail.

523
00:28:45,992 --> 00:28:46,896
Doctor...

524
00:28:48,762 --> 00:28:50,205
Brother-in-law, you have arrived!

525
00:28:52,579 --> 00:28:53,419
Greetings, doctor.

526
00:28:54,438 --> 00:28:56,264
Doctor, you have to somehow save me.

527
00:28:56,431 --> 00:28:57,990
Don't worry.
Please sit down.

528
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,743
What's your problem?

529
00:29:03,847 --> 00:29:04,815
Tell him.

530
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:12,289
I have been suffering from a
strange disease since recent times.

531
00:29:14,674 --> 00:29:17,739
No problem. You came to the right place.

532
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,636
I have FRCS degree from London.

533
00:29:19,829 --> 00:29:21,627
-Yes.
-Tell me your problem without hesitation.

534
00:29:23,372 --> 00:29:28,059
My anger goes out of bounds
when someone touches my belongings.

535
00:29:28,353 --> 00:29:31,202
When I wish for
something and can't get it,

536
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:34,614
I get very tensed

537
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:37,122
-I want to strangle and kill them.
-Is it?

538
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:38,024
True.

539
00:29:38,365 --> 00:29:39,240
Give me your hand.

540
00:29:43,647 --> 00:29:44,304
Oh man!

541
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:44,977
Oh no!

542
00:29:45,188 --> 00:29:48,310
You are having bipolar
disorder. Advanced stage.

543
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:50,049
Will I die then?

544
00:29:50,391 --> 00:29:53,934
You won't die but you'd behave violently.

545
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:56,947
You'd crave to commit a murder or rape.

546
00:29:57,078 --> 00:29:58,649
If I am not wrong,

547
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:02,306
it's been a week that you had
slept or eaten. Am I right?

548
00:30:02,483 --> 00:30:04,751
[whimpers]

549
00:30:04,806 --> 00:30:05,474
Hey...

550
00:30:05,673 --> 00:30:06,591
-Brother-in-law...
-Relax... Relax...

551
00:30:06,787 --> 00:30:08,920
You are hundred percent correct, doctor.

552
00:30:08,998 --> 00:30:10,476
Hundred percent correct.

553
00:30:11,138 --> 00:30:12,138
You are great, doctor!

554
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,906
You held my pulse and spoke about
my problem as if you have seen.

555
00:30:16,758 --> 00:30:18,952
-Subba Reddy.
-Brother-in-law...

556
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:24,465
Tell the doctor why I couldn't
sleep from the past one week.

557
00:30:24,758 --> 00:30:26,459
I will tell him, brother-in-law.

558
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:28,917
Doctor, the thing is that...

559
00:30:28,987 --> 00:30:31,475
Recently when we were off to
Jammalamadugu about a court issue,

560
00:30:31,751 --> 00:30:33,967
he asked to pull over to pee.

561
00:30:33,972 --> 00:30:36,233
When he got down,
he was shocked at what he saw.

562
00:30:36,663 --> 00:30:40,231
20 acres of mango plantation spread
across a single bit of land, all fenced.

563
00:30:40,775 --> 00:30:44,535
-Tell him why I can't eat, as well.
-Yes, I will tell him, brother-in-law.

564
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:47,346
The thing is that,

565
00:30:47,574 --> 00:30:49,092
we attended a feast at Siva Reddy's place

566
00:30:49,184 --> 00:30:50,927
on the day of his elder
daughter's puberty function.

567
00:30:51,024 --> 00:30:53,842
We came outside after the feast to
smoke and have Paan and to our surprise,

568
00:30:53,882 --> 00:30:55,954
there was a big European
structured building in front of us.

569
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:58,672
He became upset for not
having such a building for him

570
00:30:58,772 --> 00:31:01,766
and he's been yearning from
that day and couldn't eat anything.

571
00:31:01,815 --> 00:31:02,299
Hmm...

572
00:31:02,411 --> 00:31:04,837
Those two properties belong to me, sir.

573
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,064
Hmm... Understood?

574
00:31:07,111 --> 00:31:08,586
I bought them with my
hard-earned money, sir.

575
00:31:08,796 --> 00:31:10,124
Will I give if you just ask?

576
00:31:10,278 --> 00:31:12,566
Brother-in-law, what did you do when some
guy asked the same question recently?

577
00:31:12,628 --> 00:31:14,940
-What did he say?
-What did I say?

578
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:19,642
I took a boulder beside
and smashed his head.

579
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:21,078
Hey doctor,

580
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:21,974
[trembles]

581
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:26,521
you know my disease and its stage as well.

582
00:31:27,245 --> 00:31:27,850
Here...

583
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:30,262
Sign it now!

584
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:40,414
May all evil eyes from the knives,
weapons, lands etc should be warded off.

585
00:31:40,701 --> 00:31:41,643
-Put this inside.
-Yes. [dogs barking]

586
00:31:44,392 --> 00:31:45,638
Greetings, Mr Konda Reddy.

587
00:31:50,218 --> 00:31:53,755
-Sister, I want that mango.
-Okay.

588
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:56,129
Stay here.
I'll go and get it for you.

589
00:32:02,577 --> 00:32:04,130
-Hey Subba Reddy
-Yes, brother-in-law.

590
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:07,886
-Go, settle the issue and return.
-Okay, brother-in-law.

591
00:32:08,012 --> 00:32:11,580
Look Rangappa, if you act smart,
you'll end up losing what you have.

592
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:12,825
-That won't happen, sir.
-Let's go.

593
00:32:13,507 --> 00:32:14,727
See you, sir.

594
00:32:24,446 --> 00:32:25,070
[snaps]

595
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:28,597
[dogs growling]

596
00:32:35,215 --> 00:32:36,143
[dogs barking]

597
00:32:36,343 --> 00:32:37,463
[gasps]

598
00:32:39,263 --> 00:32:40,398
Oh mother...

599
00:32:42,484 --> 00:32:44,701
[kid crying]
It is finished, dear.

600
00:32:44,744 --> 00:32:46,616
-Bear for a minute, it's done.
-Oh mother...

601
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:51,910
How can he set his dogs on a school
going girl for the sake of a mere mango?

602
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:52,559
Rascal!

603
00:32:53,442 --> 00:32:54,616
Have you filed a police complaint?

604
00:32:59,184 --> 00:32:59,938
Tell me, madam.

605
00:33:00,185 --> 00:33:02,317
Take the statement from
the girl and file a case.

606
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,135
Tell me, on whose name
should I file the case against?

607
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,440
Konda Reddy.

608
00:33:08,745 --> 00:33:11,061
[mobile rings]

609
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:15,576
How are you doing, SP?

610
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:18,081
I am doing fine,
but I expect the same from you.

611
00:33:18,202 --> 00:33:19,595
What happened, SP?

612
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:23,463
Was there any police case filed
against you in the last 24 hours?

613
00:33:26,741 --> 00:33:29,799
Cases filed against Konda
Reddy are like hair on the head.

614
00:33:29,987 --> 00:33:31,364
They just come and go.

615
00:33:31,598 --> 00:33:34,212
<i>Do you know there was a case filed
against you today, under section 324?</i>

616
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:35,591
It is an animal act.

617
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:37,878
The case is about letting your
dogs bite a school going girl.

618
00:33:37,927 --> 00:33:39,913
Oh! [laughing]

619
00:33:40,027 --> 00:33:42,762
That one? That's a petty case, SP.

620
00:33:42,884 --> 00:33:44,179
Of course, the case is petty

621
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:46,498
but the officer who is dealing
that case is not an ordinary person.

622
00:33:47,903 --> 00:33:50,188
Why are you getting so tensed, SP?

623
00:33:50,201 --> 00:33:52,279
We have come across a
lot of such officers.

624
00:33:52,534 --> 00:33:54,429
You might have come across
many such officers, Reddy.

625
00:33:54,637 --> 00:33:56,370
But he is a hot-headed guy!

626
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:04,172
He won't be alive if he meddles with me.

627
00:34:04,372 --> 00:34:06,855
<i>A lot of thugs who meddled
with him have bitten dust, Reddy.</i>

628
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,969
[shot fired]

629
00:34:10,785 --> 00:34:11,651
[shots fired]

630
00:34:13,122 --> 00:34:14,162
<i>If you want to stay alive...</i>

631
00:34:14,447 --> 00:34:16,499
How far is Rajahmundry
Central Jail from your place?

632
00:34:16,568 --> 00:34:19,340
Central Jail? It is just 6
hours away, if we drive fast.

633
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:20,494
Then, be on it.

634
00:34:23,051 --> 00:34:25,162
Go there within 4 hours
and meet the jailor.

635
00:34:25,319 --> 00:34:27,019
RAJAHMUNDRY 121 KMS

636
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:30,509
He'd show you a guy who would
tell you about that officer.

637
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,414
RAJAHMUNDRY CENTRAL JAIL

638
00:34:45,761 --> 00:34:47,402
The SP of Kadapa has sent me here.

639
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:53,895
Why did you bring me here?

640
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,914
The guy you seek is here. Come with me.

641
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,480
Where is he?

642
00:34:59,783 --> 00:35:00,737
That's the man.

643
00:35:14,201 --> 00:35:18,627
Hey... This tastes bland. Get some salt.

644
00:35:18,931 --> 00:35:21,701
The SP made such a big hype to meet...

645
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,379
this mere cook?

646
00:35:24,349 --> 00:35:25,394
Where do you hail from?

647
00:35:26,879 --> 00:35:27,691
Kadapa.

648
00:35:27,718 --> 00:35:28,911
How many vehicles did you bring here?

649
00:35:29,307 --> 00:35:30,258
Three.

650
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:31,508
He brought six vehicles.

651
00:35:32,411 --> 00:35:35,005
How many would accompany you
while you leave your home?

652
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,221
A maximum of ten people.

653
00:35:39,076 --> 00:35:41,109
A minimum of 25 people
accompany him when he goes out.

654
00:35:41,826 --> 00:35:43,282
How many murders have you committed?

655
00:35:44,034 --> 00:35:46,476
Many! 12 of them.

656
00:35:48,152 --> 00:35:49,770
He has committed 22 murders.

657
00:35:50,564 --> 00:35:52,402
And 30 more murders were
committed on his behalf.

658
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:55,006
Total of 52 murders, only what we know.

659
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,734
Who is this notorious
thug that I am unaware of?

660
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:01,431
He is Katari Krishna from Ongole.

661
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:06,538
<i>Do you know how Katari
Krishna's story began?</i>

662
00:36:06,615 --> 00:36:08,172
<i>Do you know how it all began?</i>

663
00:36:08,286 --> 00:36:11,583
<i>In the days when Pulavarthi Sreenu
was reigning rowdyism in Ongole,</i>

664
00:36:11,654 --> 00:36:13,934
<i>Katari Krishna and
Jayamma worked in that gang.</i>

665
00:36:17,469 --> 00:36:18,633
What are those, boss?

666
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:21,386
They are country made bombs.

667
00:36:22,783 --> 00:36:24,235
Do things work with those bombs?

668
00:36:24,242 --> 00:36:27,765
We have to make a series of stabbing
to kill someone, if we use knives.

669
00:36:27,947 --> 00:36:30,813
If we use axes, we have to
keep striking until they die.

670
00:36:31,235 --> 00:36:32,871
But when it comes to this bomb,

671
00:36:32,979 --> 00:36:36,532
we can just throw and those
wastrels would be dead at once.

672
00:36:37,477 --> 00:36:38,175
Is it?

673
00:36:38,331 --> 00:36:39,240
Yes.

674
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,564
I want to see them once, boss.

675
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,364
Go ahead.

676
00:36:44,607 --> 00:36:45,124
Hey...

677
00:36:45,596 --> 00:36:46,594
Please give me once, brother.

"He is always up for chaos"

685
00:37:42,044 --> 00:37:45,604
"He climbs on the pile of
dead bodies step by step"

686
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:49,573
"And throws a
challenge at opponent's turf"

Tell me, little brother.

696
00:39:34,047 --> 00:39:36,840
Our Kadapa SP has asked me
to meet you on an urgent basis, brother.

697
00:39:39,735 --> 00:39:41,358
Did he come to your town?

698
00:39:41,636 --> 00:39:42,575
Who are you talking about?

699
00:39:42,663 --> 00:39:45,530
Did CI Shankar arrive in your town?

700
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:46,886
I was told that he was arriving.

701
00:39:47,063 --> 00:39:48,949
What is this big hype about him?

702
00:39:49,247 --> 00:39:52,782
What's with you and what's with
the story I heard about you outside?

703
00:39:52,864 --> 00:39:55,012
And what are you doing here?

704
00:40:22,342 --> 00:40:25,453
I, who lived in Ongole with pride and
high stature at one point of time,

705
00:40:25,783 --> 00:40:29,424
am now sitting in jail like
a fool before you, the reason is...

706
00:40:31,841 --> 00:40:33,021
this nail.

707
00:40:33,608 --> 00:40:34,771
Nail!

708
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:36,405
This nail!

709
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,763
A nail?

710
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:46,399
Some people want success and everyone
wants to live life to the fullest.

711
00:40:46,482 --> 00:40:51,104
The opponents' hopes on their lives is
the strength to budding thugs like me.

712
00:40:51,186 --> 00:40:54,153
I made money on people's ashes.

713
00:40:54,231 --> 00:40:57,139
Every dead body that
showed up has got my signature.

714
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,003
The entire Ongole was in my lap.

715
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,253
In the due course, my strength and
entourage have grown. [camera clicks]

716
00:41:02,152 --> 00:41:04,659
Along with them,
I have developed a weakness as well.

717
00:41:05,302 --> 00:41:06,398
My daughter.

718
00:41:12,234 --> 00:41:13,636
What is the progress of elections?

719
00:41:13,657 --> 00:41:15,153
-These elections are tormenting.
-Thank you.

720
00:41:15,294 --> 00:41:18,076
Elections has become an
expensive affair these days.

721
00:41:18,135 --> 00:41:22,127
For me to contest as MLA again,
I need to at least spend 50 crore rupees.

722
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:23,490
Let me know if you have any interest.

723
00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:24,731
-I'll talk to the high command
-Hi dude!

724
00:41:24,739 --> 00:41:25,342
and get you a party ticket.

725
00:41:25,435 --> 00:41:27,607
-Who told you, Ongole has gone dry?
-What you have to do is--

726
00:41:27,837 --> 00:41:29,490
I have just played tennis with a hot girl.

727
00:41:29,692 --> 00:41:32,029
While I was playing with
one ball, I saw two more.

728
00:41:32,693 --> 00:41:34,845
I will get her to the
guest house within two days...

729
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,421
and I'll play a live match with her.
[glass shatters]

730
00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:38,397
[exclaims]

731
00:41:43,603 --> 00:41:45,713
I don't care if someone talks
bad about me, Koteshwar Rao.

732
00:41:46,852 --> 00:41:48,810
But that rogue has struck on my heart.

733
00:41:49,407 --> 00:41:51,021
Shouldn't he deserve such a big blow?

734
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,497
Err... He does.

735
00:41:53,907 --> 00:41:56,734
A new CI is posted to
Ongole One Town police station.

736
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:58,772
[siren wailing]

737
00:42:00,298 --> 00:42:04,423
Hey... Trains at the railway station
and policemen at the police station...

738
00:42:04,471 --> 00:42:05,761
...would come and go.

739
00:42:06,046 --> 00:42:07,162
As if this is big news!

740
00:42:07,179 --> 00:42:08,764
As if this is worthy of
publishing and reading!

741
00:42:08,868 --> 00:42:10,018
It is a waste of our tea-time.

742
00:42:10,201 --> 00:42:11,350
Let's see what would this new guy achieve!

743
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:14,378
Achieve my foot!
Meanwhile, get the fritters packet.

744
00:42:14,485 --> 00:42:16,966
-Okay.
-Hey... Pay the amount, sir.

745
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:20,856
[people protesting] Ban it! Ban it!

746
00:42:21,043 --> 00:42:22,961
Ban the film 'Thaata Theestha'!

747
00:42:23,162 --> 00:42:24,865
-Switch off the camera.
-Mad Gangadhar...

748
00:42:25,106 --> 00:42:27,030
What is this?
What's with this silent protest?

749
00:42:27,221 --> 00:42:28,728
We can't even telecast
it on a local channel.

750
00:42:28,818 --> 00:42:32,388
If you want this to get telecasted on
a state channel, there should be emotion.

751
00:42:32,671 --> 00:42:34,996
Ban it! Ban it on emotional grounds!

752
00:42:35,196 --> 00:42:36,261
[people protesting]

753
00:42:36,546 --> 00:42:38,174
[siren wailing]

754
00:43:01,876 --> 00:43:04,998
[protesting] Ban it!
Ban it on emotional grounds!

755
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:11,317
[protesting] Ban it!
Ban it on emotional grounds!

756
00:43:11,533 --> 00:43:13,149
Ban it on emotional grounds!

757
00:43:14,689 --> 00:43:15,704
What should be banned?
[camera captures]

758
00:43:15,778 --> 00:43:17,998
The newly released movie 'Thaata Theestha'

759
00:43:18,727 --> 00:43:20,619
has the depiction of people of my caste
as villains which is an insult to us.

760
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:22,647
-Oh!
-Are people of my caste villains?

761
00:43:22,742 --> 00:43:23,447
Wouldn't there be any heroes?

762
00:43:23,662 --> 00:43:26,196
Is it that people of my caste commit
rapes? Wouldn't they fall in love?

763
00:43:26,582 --> 00:43:31,115
This agitation wouldn't stop until the
director 'Mad Gangadhar' apologises to us.

764
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,949
Otherwise, we'll take them to the task!

765
00:43:32,981 --> 00:43:35,176
You've been calling him as Mad person,
right? Why are you still staying here?

766
00:43:35,354 --> 00:43:36,887
-Disperse. Disperse, all of you.
-How can we just leave?

767
00:43:37,013 --> 00:43:38,261
It has hurt our sentiments.

768
00:43:38,363 --> 00:43:39,783
Sentiments? What does it mean?

769
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:41,328
Sentiments mean...

770
00:43:41,475 --> 00:43:42,939
Something that gets hurt at
the time of a film release.

771
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:45,753
-Yes, those things!
-Oh! Wow! Wow!

772
00:43:45,969 --> 00:43:49,065
I, now, clearly understand the
mental status of all of you.

773
00:43:49,587 --> 00:43:50,966
Hey, pass it.

774
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,032
[groans]

775
00:44:08,668 --> 00:44:09,939
[groans]

776
00:44:11,025 --> 00:44:11,862
[groans]

777
00:44:16,907 --> 00:44:19,756
[groans]

778
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,068
Sir... Sir... Please don't hit us.
We don't belong to this caste.

779
00:44:24,165 --> 00:44:25,231
Then, why are you here?

780
00:44:25,675 --> 00:44:27,348
We came here on the pretext of
seeing ourselves on the television.

781
00:44:27,484 --> 00:44:29,081
But you were going overboard a while ago?

782
00:44:29,155 --> 00:44:31,765
Sir, we did this because
that media guy provoked us.

783
00:44:31,771 --> 00:44:32,473
He is the one.

784
00:44:33,288 --> 00:44:34,140
What is that?

785
00:44:35,018 --> 00:44:35,587
Him?

786
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:37,175
-Yes, sir.
-Hey, come here.

787
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,865
Wow! Your walking style is mindblowing!

788
00:44:41,065 --> 00:44:42,701
Wow! How come you walked so heroically?

789
00:44:42,742 --> 00:44:43,532
Media!

790
00:44:43,717 --> 00:44:45,532
Eyes and ears for society.

791
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,881
Wow! My cutie boy! My
darling! Give me a hug, dear.

792
00:44:50,016 --> 00:44:50,739
With pleasure.

793
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,940
Ew! Yuck! Yuck!

794
00:44:53,162 --> 00:44:54,056
When was the last time
you took a head bath?

795
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:55,125
It is been two weeks, sir.

796
00:44:55,166 --> 00:44:56,040
What's the problem?

797
00:44:56,133 --> 00:44:57,804
Water scarcity in Ongole.

798
00:44:57,924 --> 00:45:00,355
This one...
This one is what genuine problem is.

799
00:45:00,403 --> 00:45:02,146
-Sorry, sir.
-Focus on such issues.

800
00:45:02,154 --> 00:45:05,164
If you ever come to this side or
provoke people, you're so done

801
00:45:07,683 --> 00:45:10,565
Switch off the cameras and run away, guys!

802
00:45:23,615 --> 00:45:24,835
[in unison] Morning, sir.

803
00:45:26,438 --> 00:45:27,751
-I am SI Tilak, sir.
-Srinu, sir.

804
00:45:27,804 --> 00:45:28,836
-Appa Rao, sir.
-Ramulu, sir.

805
00:45:28,987 --> 00:45:30,218
That was a rocking entry, sir.

806
00:45:30,786 --> 00:45:32,103
You gave a nice touch of your style, sir.

807
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:33,964
-You didn't say your name?
-Balaji, sir.

808
00:45:34,927 --> 00:45:36,143
Sai Kumar, sir.

809
00:45:36,648 --> 00:45:37,633
Are you a cinephile?

810
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:38,610
Yeah.

811
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:40,467
Hmm... Whoa!

812
00:45:40,586 --> 00:45:42,241
-Abdullah, sir.
-Ashok Kumar, sir.

813
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:43,686
Constable Kiran, sir.

814
00:45:45,021 --> 00:45:46,023
Welcome to Ongole, sir.

815
00:45:47,413 --> 00:45:48,156
Thank you.

816
00:45:48,311 --> 00:45:49,462
You are my inspiration, sir

817
00:45:49,852 --> 00:45:51,258
The town might not know this,

818
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:54,068
but the entire department knows that
you're the one who caught Saleem Bhatkal.

819
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:55,293
I'm the son of Mr Raju,

820
00:45:55,369 --> 00:45:57,757
the head constable who worked
with you at Kurnool and retired, sir.

821
00:45:57,987 --> 00:45:59,515
-Hey, is it?
-Yes, sir.

822
00:45:59,522 --> 00:46:01,120
-How is Mr Raju doing?
-He is doing good, sir.

823
00:46:01,313 --> 00:46:03,271
-Convey my regards to him.
-Sure, sir.

824
00:46:04,698 --> 00:46:05,915
<i>Dosa...</i>

825
00:46:10,668 --> 00:46:11,975
Dosa...

826
00:46:12,067 --> 00:46:13,628
Getting it in a moment son!

827
00:46:14,128 --> 00:46:15,715
You shouldn't eat food so quickly, kiddo.

828
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:17,998
This crazy kiddo can't distinguish
between asking and screaming.

829
00:46:18,198 --> 00:46:19,000
Eat.

830
00:46:20,201 --> 00:46:21,951
Oh no! It is spicy!

831
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:23,537
Is it so spicy? Let me get sugar for you.

832
00:46:23,886 --> 00:46:25,069
My father called.

833
00:46:25,269 --> 00:46:26,553
Hmm. What's the matter?

834
00:46:26,771 --> 00:46:30,622
He said, "Ongole has a too many thugs
and your husband has too much anger."

835
00:46:30,822 --> 00:46:33,753
"He will go against them
without a second thought."

836
00:46:33,804 --> 00:46:35,672
"Ask him to be a little careful."

837
00:46:36,578 --> 00:46:38,963
Honey, will you ask your
father to do something?

838
00:46:39,578 --> 00:46:41,044
If he has got no work to do,

839
00:46:41,088 --> 00:46:44,225
I will buy four acres of land, some
buffaloes and pigs for him.

840
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:45,947
Ask him to milk them and sell the milk.

841
00:46:47,801 --> 00:46:50,567
Everyone is always ready to give
free advice. I don't know why.

842
00:46:50,922 --> 00:46:51,731
Come on, eat.

843
00:46:54,033 --> 00:46:55,026
And anger kicks in!

844
00:46:55,226 --> 00:46:56,150
Hello! I'm talking to you!

845
00:46:56,316 --> 00:46:57,116
I don't want it either.

846
00:46:57,316 --> 00:46:58,245
Huh? Hey, what happened to you?

847
00:46:58,392 --> 00:47:00,642
Mom got angry. So do I.

848
00:47:00,729 --> 00:47:02,611
Huh? Hey... Hey...

849
00:47:03,067 --> 00:47:07,200
Oh man! What's with their anger?
They neither eat nor let me eat.

850
00:47:07,854 --> 00:47:08,722
-Mom
-Yes.

851
00:47:08,947 --> 00:47:12,736
I'd anyway wake up in the hall,
in the morning. Shall I sleep there?

852
00:47:12,793 --> 00:47:14,234
No, sleep here.

853
00:47:14,325 --> 00:47:15,589
That won't happen today.

854
00:47:15,964 --> 00:47:19,537
Why not, darling?
Somnambulism affects regularly, isn't it?

855
00:47:19,598 --> 00:47:20,656
It won't be there today.

856
00:47:21,387 --> 00:47:23,230
Why wouldn't it be there today, dad?

857
00:47:23,419 --> 00:47:25,374
The thing is that...
Come here, I'll explain.

858
00:47:25,644 --> 00:47:27,312
Your mom doesn't know anything.

859
00:47:27,425 --> 00:47:30,180
Be it at the classroom or the bedroom,
the time-table shouldn't be missed.

860
00:47:30,232 --> 00:47:31,908
Every subject has to be
taught at it's own hour!

861
00:47:32,108 --> 00:47:34,170
But that wouldn't when
the teacher is on leave!

862
00:47:35,218 --> 00:47:36,996
Wow! My dear son!

863
00:47:37,077 --> 00:47:39,135
You've inherited all your mom's sharpness!

864
00:47:39,186 --> 00:47:40,594
Go to sleep, young devil!

865
00:47:40,915 --> 00:47:41,797
Go to sleep.

866
00:47:42,554 --> 00:47:43,886
-Kallu...
-Hmph!

867
00:47:44,665 --> 00:47:48,226
Whoa! This means no chance.

868
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:50,231
[sighs]

869
00:47:51,037 --> 00:47:53,924
Sleep, dear. Sleep...

870
00:48:10,716 --> 00:48:11,703
-Dad!
-[gasps]

871
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:14,020
It is you who's been making me sleep
in the hall every day, aren't you?

872
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:17,467
No, I am patting to put
you to sleep. Patting you.

873
00:48:17,567 --> 00:48:18,690
Sleep, dear. Sleep...

874
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:20,300
Go to sleep.

875
00:48:20,665 --> 00:48:22,124
Sleep, dear. Sleep...

876
00:48:22,376 --> 00:48:24,466
Sleep, son. Sleep...

877
00:48:24,779 --> 00:48:29,106
Phew! I won't go anywhere.
I will stay here. Okay?

878
00:48:29,271 --> 00:48:30,683
Sleep, dear. Sleep...

879
00:48:30,883 --> 00:48:33,835
Mom, is this somnambulism?

880
00:48:34,952 --> 00:48:36,362
Hey, just sleep.

881
00:49:23,075 --> 00:49:24,500
Moustache...

882
00:49:26,369 --> 00:49:27,859
Mr. Moustache.

883
00:49:29,224 --> 00:49:31,306
Somnambulism

884
00:49:31,906 --> 00:49:33,742
Hmm... Woohoo!

885
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,787
-Darling, it's been already so late.
-Hmm... Hmm...

886
00:49:45,433 --> 00:49:46,844
First, tell me something.

887
00:49:47,334 --> 00:49:50,745
I can't resist answering or doing
anything you ask, at this time.

888
00:49:51,067 --> 00:49:51,945
Come on, shoot.

889
00:49:52,034 --> 00:49:55,238
Am I your first wife or is it your job?

890
00:49:56,507 --> 00:49:57,769
Both are the same to me.

891
00:49:58,122 --> 00:50:00,943
You are my first wife and
the job is my elder wife.

892
00:50:02,996 --> 00:50:05,753
You are uncatchable!

893
00:50:12,823 --> 00:50:18,796
"Don't know what relation you
have with the uniform you wear!"

894
00:50:21,681 --> 00:50:27,599
"Don't know how it made it to you"

895
00:50:30,472 --> 00:50:36,347
"It has your interest and
is kicking me out now!"

896
00:50:36,849 --> 00:50:42,356
"It's not letting me have your time!"

897
00:50:42,774 --> 00:50:48,125
"You take care of its mess now,
dear husband!"

898
00:50:51,472 --> 00:50:56,970
"Angry cop! Take care of me too!"

899
00:50:57,311 --> 00:51:03,023
"Let me be with you like
the stars on your chest"

900
00:51:16,111 --> 00:51:22,054
"Don't know what relation you
have with the uniform you wear!"

901
00:51:24,943 --> 00:51:30,917
"Don't know how it made it to you"

902
00:52:15,621 --> 00:52:21,031
"You don't remember anything
once you are engulfed in work"

903
00:52:21,285 --> 00:52:26,890
"I can't be peaceful
once you leave to work"

904
00:52:27,588 --> 00:52:32,903
"Longing for you and love together"

905
00:52:33,736 --> 00:52:38,837
"All the time goes in your thoughts"

906
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:45,049
"Any bell I hear ringing, I remember you"

907
00:52:45,882 --> 00:52:51,328
"I always pray for your safety"

908
00:52:51,705 --> 00:52:57,234
"You are my world and my life is with you"

909
00:53:00,235 --> 00:53:05,954
"Angry cop! Take care of me too!"

910
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:12,310
"Let me be with you like
the stars on your chest"

911
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:30,958
"Don't know what relation you
have with the uniform you wear!"

912
00:53:33,917 --> 00:53:39,906
"Don't know how it made it to you"

913
00:53:45,624 --> 00:53:47,876
[mobile ringing]

914
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:50,285
-Order a tea, Kiran.
-OK, sir.

915
00:53:51,043 --> 00:53:51,711
Hello...

916
00:53:51,746 --> 00:53:53,121
I heard that you have
newly arrived at the station.

917
00:53:53,223 --> 00:53:54,981
Don't you know to pay a visit
when you come to the town?

918
00:53:55,181 --> 00:53:55,929
Who the hell are you?

919
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:57,391
I am the local leader.

920
00:53:57,499 --> 00:54:02,015
If you ever come across me
anywhere due to your ill-fate or bad time,

921
00:54:02,226 --> 00:54:05,886
I'll bash you so bad that neither your
family nor others would identify you.

922
00:54:05,973 --> 00:54:07,711
-Hey...
-Hey! Shut it!

923
00:54:07,943 --> 00:54:09,173
Bloody wastrel and
your annoying baritone!

924
00:54:09,258 --> 00:54:10,086
Hang up!

925
00:54:11,058 --> 00:54:12,700
Local leader, my foot!

926
00:54:14,371 --> 00:54:15,661
What, Kiran? Why are you smiling?

927
00:54:15,992 --> 00:54:18,206
If you don't mind,
can I ask you something, sir?

928
00:54:18,615 --> 00:54:19,401
Go ahead.

929
00:54:19,753 --> 00:54:21,317
-My father was right about you.
-Which was?

930
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,071
that you are a hot-headed guy.

931
00:54:25,989 --> 00:54:26,819
Sorry, sir.

932
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:31,139
Why are you so angered
by the word 'background', sir?

933
00:54:32,006 --> 00:54:33,710
I have grown up as an orphan
since childhood, Kiran.

934
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:34,857
Wherever I went,

935
00:54:34,905 --> 00:54:38,630
everyone has asked me about my
background and irritated me terribly.

936
00:54:38,889 --> 00:54:40,946
As if that is a license
to wear around one's neck!

937
00:54:41,382 --> 00:54:44,294
That's why that word enrages me a lot.

938
00:54:44,813 --> 00:54:46,742
I don't know why... I lose control.

939
00:54:46,958 --> 00:54:49,039
But I will try to control.
Huh! Shall we go?

940
00:54:49,487 --> 00:54:50,359
Okay, sir.

941
00:54:51,067 --> 00:54:53,600
<i>-Didn't remember me even once?
-I didn't forget you at all!</i>

942
00:54:53,908 --> 00:54:54,925
<i>You are here.</i>

943
00:54:56,216 --> 00:54:57,172
<i>Where?</i>

944
00:55:51,811 --> 00:55:54,136
Jayamma, how is the movie?

945
00:55:54,703 --> 00:55:57,371
The movie is good but your
daughter's activities aren't.

946
00:55:58,492 --> 00:55:59,942
What are you talking?

947
00:56:00,715 --> 00:56:02,391
Your daughter too came
to the movie, Krishna.

948
00:56:02,496 --> 00:56:04,057
Shouldn't she go to a movie?

949
00:56:04,186 --> 00:56:05,901
There was a guy beside her.

950
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,203
I think he is her boyfriend.

951
00:56:07,723 --> 00:56:10,756
He's been laying hands and
whispering to her ears in the dark.

952
00:56:10,869 --> 00:56:12,065
Wouldn't that seem disgusting?

953
00:56:13,408 --> 00:56:14,461
Did you see properly?

954
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,598
Yes. I saw them with my own eyes.

955
00:56:17,235 --> 00:56:19,933
I know you'd feel sad when
I tell you this, Krishna.

956
00:56:20,133 --> 00:56:21,454
As it is a matter of a girl,

957
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,492
it's not good if it goes public.

958
00:56:24,584 --> 00:56:25,628
We have to conceal it secretly.

959
00:56:25,737 --> 00:56:26,318
Conceal my foot...

960
00:56:26,518 --> 00:56:28,651
Look, don't get aggressive in this manner.

961
00:56:29,556 --> 00:56:31,228
You have recently
killed some guy in public.

962
00:56:31,527 --> 00:56:32,725
Not again.

963
00:56:32,978 --> 00:56:34,542
Moreover, he is a cop.

964
00:56:35,149 --> 00:56:37,867
We have to look before we leap.

965
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:54,713
Go to Vetapalem.

966
00:56:57,486 --> 00:56:58,426
[bus honking]

967
00:56:59,727 --> 00:57:00,735
[bus honking]

968
00:57:01,744 --> 00:57:03,171
ONGOLE TO VETAPALEM

969
00:57:17,421 --> 00:57:18,760
Give me a soda.

970
00:57:22,882 --> 00:57:23,694
[spits]

971
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:09,346
[flies buzzing]

972
00:58:30,724 --> 00:58:34,340
[whistling]

973
00:59:23,078 --> 00:59:27,261
[roars]

974
00:59:30,941 --> 00:59:32,605
[panting]

975
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:36,608
What is it, Ankudu? Why are
you running under the sun?

976
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:41,085
We have consumed donkey's blood, Jayamma.

977
00:59:41,194 --> 00:59:44,268
The body needs such a
workout to digest it.

978
00:59:45,002 --> 00:59:49,178
Otherwise, the blood will
coagulate and we'll die.

979
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:51,594
[breathes heavily]
What task brings you here?

980
00:59:52,656 --> 00:59:54,209
Krishna has got some task for you.

981
00:59:54,788 --> 00:59:55,839
It's his personal.

982
01:00:01,634 --> 01:00:03,271
Hey... Hey... Wait.

983
01:00:04,761 --> 01:00:05,222
Here...

984
01:00:05,414 --> 01:00:07,495
-Eat it hot upon reaching the station.
-Okay, mom.

985
01:00:08,399 --> 01:00:09,336
Drive safely.

986
01:00:09,481 --> 01:00:11,405
Dad might forget to take
pills on time. Remind him.

987
01:00:11,539 --> 01:00:12,863
-Okay.
-See you. Bye.

988
01:00:32,565 --> 01:00:33,497
[rocket whistling]

989
01:00:36,357 --> 01:00:37,000
[rocket blasts]

990
01:00:54,959 --> 01:00:58,263
[footsteps running]

991
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:00,093
[headlight broken]

992
01:01:00,781 --> 01:01:03,585
[Kiran groans in pain]

993
01:01:22,934 --> 01:01:23,995
[Kiran groaning]

994
01:01:32,924 --> 01:01:34,163
Ah!

995
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:47,345
[Kiran groaning]

996
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,265
[Kiran screams]

997
01:02:04,585 --> 01:02:05,660
Throw the stone!

998
01:02:59,915 --> 01:03:01,417
[eagle squeals]

999
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:04,966
[dogs growling]

1000
01:03:43,688 --> 01:03:45,581
[no voice]

1001
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:59,196
[sobbing]

1002
01:04:47,534 --> 01:04:49,775
I have done many
postmortems in my service.

1003
01:04:49,866 --> 01:04:53,374
But this is the first time in my life
I've come across such a brutal killing.

1004
01:04:53,949 --> 01:04:57,023
Generally, people commit
murders out of vengeance or grudge.

1005
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:00,483
But these killers have done it
as if it is a sport of hunting.

1006
01:05:01,106 --> 01:05:03,371
They made their first blow on the neck.

1007
01:05:04,331 --> 01:05:05,517
Later, they have gone for legs.

1008
01:05:05,711 --> 01:05:08,226
This pattern is called
wolf-attack, in general.

1009
01:05:14,515 --> 01:05:16,214
Did you encounter such cases earlier?

1010
01:05:17,142 --> 01:05:20,449
Well... I came to know that my senior
colleague has dealt a similar case before.

1011
01:05:21,326 --> 01:05:22,605
Where is he now?

1012
01:05:23,077 --> 01:05:25,448
He lives in this town
but he is retired now.

1013
01:05:26,103 --> 01:05:28,108
-Okay. Thank you, doctor.
-That's okay.

1014
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:28,906
Balaji...

1015
01:05:37,681 --> 01:05:39,572
Mr Raju, trust me.

1016
01:05:40,123 --> 01:05:42,472
I will not spare anyone who
were involved in Kiran's murder.

1017
01:05:43,156 --> 01:05:44,399
I swear on my uniform.

1018
01:05:45,647 --> 01:05:46,789
Be brave.

1019
01:05:53,127 --> 01:05:58,141
There were 15 similar cases,
on which I have performed postmortem.

1020
01:05:58,162 --> 01:06:01,856
In some cases,
there were only bodies with no heads.

1021
01:06:02,545 --> 01:06:05,634
The murder of your constable
took place in a similar fashion.

1022
01:06:06,315 --> 01:06:07,870
Same old signature style.

1023
01:06:07,962 --> 01:06:10,836
I have sent all the reports of
postmortem which I have done,

1024
01:06:11,055 --> 01:06:13,157
to the concerned police stations.

1025
01:06:13,163 --> 01:06:16,664
Our hospital has the copies
of the same reports as well.

1026
01:06:16,735 --> 01:06:19,161
You can go through them if necessary.

1027
01:06:19,262 --> 01:06:21,254
-Thank you so much for the info, sir.
-It's okay.

1028
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,717
-I'll see you again if needed.
-Welcome.

1029
01:06:22,817 --> 01:06:23,611
Thank you, sir.

1030
01:06:25,234 --> 01:06:27,745
Tilak, Balaji, Sai...
All of you, come here.

1031
01:06:28,592 --> 01:06:30,259
These are the post mortem reports.

1032
01:06:30,459 --> 01:06:31,877
Get info on which police
stations in the district

1033
01:06:32,022 --> 01:06:34,565
have registered the cases
related to these post mortem reports.

1034
01:06:34,802 --> 01:06:37,802
Then, get the related FIRs, charge sheets,
witness list along with their addresses

1035
01:06:37,889 --> 01:06:39,650
and the put them in
front of me within 24 hours.

1036
01:06:40,025 --> 01:06:40,481
Fast!

1037
01:06:40,681 --> 01:06:41,367
[in unison] Okay, sir.

1038
01:06:42,063 --> 01:06:43,932
This is the case which got
registered in the year 2005.

1039
01:06:44,188 --> 01:06:45,877
Do the FIR files of that time still exist?

1040
01:06:46,027 --> 01:06:47,553
How come you don't have
the FIR copies, sir?

1041
01:06:48,216 --> 01:06:50,103
Six years ago,
on the occasion of Diwali...

1042
01:06:50,303 --> 01:06:52,218
burning of crackers led to a
fire accident in the station

1043
01:06:52,438 --> 01:06:53,810
which resulted in
burning of many files and FIRs.

1044
01:06:53,875 --> 01:06:55,616
How come? Haven't they digitalised them?

1045
01:06:55,633 --> 01:06:57,923
The digitalisation process has
started just five years ago.

1046
01:06:58,132 --> 01:07:00,162
That's why those old reports
have no digital information, sir.

1047
01:07:10,005 --> 01:07:12,921
Sir, the slippers found in the crime
scene were made of buffalo's skin.

1048
01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:14,421
When I have enquired about them,

1049
01:07:14,602 --> 01:07:17,675
I was told that the cobblers who make
such slippers live in Gaddalakunta, sir.

1050
01:07:17,684 --> 01:07:18,806
Then, did you enquire them?

1051
01:07:18,921 --> 01:07:19,692
We did, sir.

1052
01:07:19,846 --> 01:07:22,796
But we were told that those families
left the village 10 years ago.

1053
01:07:23,202 --> 01:07:24,654
The CI who dealt this case was assigned

1054
01:07:24,869 --> 01:07:27,547
to investigate Vijayawada's
Durga temple robbery case.

1055
01:07:27,811 --> 01:07:29,456
So, this case has been
pushed into old cases.

1056
01:07:29,593 --> 01:07:33,637
As the latter officers didn't bother about
the case, it has remained as pending.

1057
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:46,606
We ran enquiry in all the police
stations related to the 15 cases...

1058
01:07:46,806 --> 01:07:47,797
...and got the details, sir.

1059
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:50,178
But there's been no
response from one station.

1060
01:07:50,229 --> 01:07:51,883
-Which station?
-Kandukuru station, sir.

1061
01:07:51,959 --> 01:07:54,253
Kandukuru station.

1062
01:08:02,685 --> 01:08:04,004
What's the matter?

1063
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:05,589
My elder sister is missing, sir.

1064
01:08:05,711 --> 01:08:07,505
We tried calling her
but her phone is switched off.

1065
01:08:07,828 --> 01:08:09,089
What's her age?

1066
01:08:09,228 --> 01:08:10,276
25 years old, sir.

1067
01:08:10,347 --> 01:08:12,935
It is automatically,
the right age to go missing!

1068
01:08:14,213 --> 01:08:16,515
I think your elder daughter
is good looking too.

1069
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:20,185
Some guy might have
automatically bumped into her.

1070
01:08:20,385 --> 01:08:21,985
My daughter is not such a girl, sir.

1071
01:08:22,050 --> 01:08:24,154
Of course, this is what
everyone would claim automatically.

1072
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:26,652
My final say is that...

1073
01:08:26,881 --> 01:08:30,029
Stop thinking about
your elder daughter who eloped,

1074
01:08:30,116 --> 01:08:32,300
and prevent your
younger daughter from eloping,

1075
01:08:32,645 --> 01:08:33,688
automatically.

1076
01:08:35,515 --> 01:08:36,654
Leave now.

1077
01:08:37,337 --> 01:08:38,557
I need to go through old records.

1078
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,236
Aren't there any rules or limits?

1079
01:08:43,433 --> 01:08:46,454
This station isn't yours. It's mine.

1080
01:08:47,807 --> 01:08:48,916
Anyhow,

1081
01:08:49,526 --> 01:08:53,897
would turning old pages bring
back lost lives or

1082
01:08:54,137 --> 01:08:55,816
make the deadman come alive?

1083
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:56,966
What do you say?

1084
01:09:01,017 --> 01:09:06,323
[ears ringing]

1085
01:09:11,465 --> 01:09:14,281
The one who died is a
policeman just like you and me.

1086
01:09:14,702 --> 01:09:16,011
Can I see those records now?

1087
01:10:20,547 --> 01:10:26,505
This is the FIR of ex-MLA Mr Subbiah's
murder case that happened 10 years ago.

1088
01:10:26,687 --> 01:10:28,698
This is lying in your
station gathering dust.

1089
01:10:30,736 --> 01:10:32,974
Hindus value Bhagad Gita,
Christians value Bible,

1090
01:10:33,008 --> 01:10:35,578
Muslims value Koran
and the police value FIR.

1091
01:10:35,948 --> 01:10:38,524
But it remained as a
rough paper in your station.

1092
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:41,093
I don't have the rights to
take action against you.

1093
01:10:41,157 --> 01:10:42,243
If I had those rights,

1094
01:10:42,535 --> 01:10:46,006
I would have taken your life,
instead of your job.

1095
01:10:52,562 --> 01:10:53,732
Don't worry, madam.

1096
01:10:53,927 --> 01:10:56,137
He will solve this case himself...

1097
01:10:57,082 --> 01:10:58,791
automatically!

1098
01:11:04,675 --> 01:11:07,059
The only evidence we have is this FIR.

1099
01:11:07,978 --> 01:11:10,070
The enquiry was stopped
because the suspects were not found.

1100
01:11:10,212 --> 01:11:13,194
Suspect 1: Vontimukkala Rama Rao.
Who the hell is he?

1101
01:11:13,372 --> 01:11:15,198
He died four years ago, sir.

1102
01:11:16,590 --> 01:11:18,616
Suspect 2: Chinna Basha.

1103
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:19,673
Who the hell is he?

1104
01:11:19,884 --> 01:11:22,570
I have enquired about him.
He has committed suicide in Nellore jail.

1105
01:11:22,665 --> 01:11:23,277
Yes, sir.

1106
01:11:23,328 --> 01:11:25,374
Suspect 3: Katari Krishna.

1107
01:11:25,397 --> 01:11:25,848
Who the hell is he?

1108
01:11:25,943 --> 01:11:28,680
-Katari Krishna is Ongole's--
-Ongole's, what?

1109
01:11:32,228 --> 01:11:32,896
Big gun sir.

1110
01:11:33,067 --> 01:11:34,155
So, he is not a human.

1111
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:35,647
Where is he?

1112
01:11:38,307 --> 01:11:40,468
What scares you? Where can he be found?

1113
01:12:20,785 --> 01:12:21,920
Look at your daughter.

1114
01:12:22,034 --> 01:12:25,415
She's been smiling as if nothing
happened despite her loved one being dead.

1115
01:12:25,975 --> 01:12:26,695
[chuckles]

1116
01:12:26,854 --> 01:12:28,370
She has inherited all your traits.

1117
01:12:28,873 --> 01:12:30,681
You guys won't value lives at all.

1118
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:42,311
He is the newly appointed
CI of One Town station.

1119
01:13:05,696 --> 01:13:07,955
I think I saw you somewhere.

1120
01:13:08,763 --> 01:13:09,845
Got it!

1121
01:13:10,065 --> 01:13:13,825
I have recently got a police officer
transferred to the punishment area.

1122
01:13:14,007 --> 01:13:15,781
For a moment, I mistook you for him.

1123
01:13:16,639 --> 01:13:18,064
Is it, Mr Krishna?

1124
01:13:18,289 --> 01:13:19,935
Recently at Addanki Bus Stand centre,

1125
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:23,848
I have thrashed the hell out of a
crooked person who was teasing girls.

1126
01:13:24,031 --> 01:13:25,092
And for a moment, I mistook you for him

1127
01:13:25,157 --> 01:13:27,244
wondering how he sits at the
fair wearing new clothes.

1128
01:13:30,123 --> 01:13:32,050
Are you here as a part of security?

1129
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:33,439
I came here to meet you.

1130
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:35,290
-Hey!
-Yes, madam.

1131
01:13:35,421 --> 01:13:36,900
Bring a chair for the officer.

1132
01:13:42,992 --> 01:13:44,061
What's the matter?

1133
01:13:44,202 --> 01:13:46,239
Our constable Kiran was killed.

1134
01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:48,174
While I was inquiring about that case,

1135
01:13:48,234 --> 01:13:51,378
I checked the FIR filed at Kandukur
station ten years ago...

1136
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:52,929
...and your name was mentioned
as a suspect.

1137
01:13:54,177 --> 01:13:55,540
That is a similar case too.

1138
01:13:55,650 --> 01:13:58,960
If you come to the station for 10 minutes,
we will just enquire and drop you off.

1139
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:00,000
Shall we go?

1140
01:14:01,224 --> 01:14:04,783
This is a fair which is organised by 20
villages and happens only once a year.

1141
01:14:05,076 --> 01:14:06,560
And that should be run
by me single-handedly.

1142
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:09,206
I can't come now.
Meet me later.

1143
01:14:12,334 --> 01:14:14,181
If there is no deity,
the fair would be stopped.

1144
01:14:14,338 --> 01:14:16,229
If there is no priest,
the pooja would be stopped.

1145
01:14:16,426 --> 01:14:18,303
If there are no percussions,
the sound would come to an end.

1146
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:19,990
But nothing would stop
if you are not here.

1147
01:14:20,129 --> 01:14:21,815
So come to the station
for just 10 minutes, sir.

1148
01:14:22,417 --> 01:14:25,246
Station? How does it look?

1149
01:14:25,604 --> 01:14:26,993
I haven't seen it before.

1150
01:14:27,106 --> 01:14:29,678
Guys, have we ever seen
a police station before?

1151
01:14:29,925 --> 01:14:35,878
[laughing]

1152
01:14:52,061 --> 01:14:53,517
Oh my!

1153
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:58,254
Why are you laughing?

1154
01:14:58,454 --> 01:15:00,807
It reminded me of my childhood
Telugu teacher's catchphrase.

1155
01:15:01,016 --> 01:15:02,033
What is it?

1156
01:15:02,122 --> 01:15:06,400
'Hey, Tom, Dick, and Harry...
I couldn't care less about who you are.'

1157
01:15:08,128 --> 01:15:13,177
I've been watching you since you arrived.
I didn't see any fear in your eyes.

1158
01:15:13,188 --> 01:15:15,953
You are just aware of my
name as Katari Krishna!

1159
01:15:16,487 --> 01:15:18,974
But you aren't aware of the
background behind that name!

1160
01:15:20,593 --> 01:15:22,299
Background!

1161
01:15:32,056 --> 01:15:34,191
[groans]

1162
01:16:00,477 --> 01:16:01,253
Hey...

1163
01:16:02,903 --> 01:16:04,234
Hey cop!

1164
01:16:06,143 --> 01:16:09,664
How dare you lay hands on Katari
Krishna in Singarakonda fair?

1165
01:16:09,924 --> 01:16:11,047
I'll slit your neck!

1166
01:16:11,237 --> 01:16:13,530
Katari Krishna himself shut
it and is coming with me.

1167
01:16:13,619 --> 01:16:16,057
What's your issue being
just a mistress? Huh?

1168
01:16:16,852 --> 01:16:18,242
I'll shave you bald!

1169
01:16:29,995 --> 01:16:30,634
Sir!

1170
01:17:16,819 --> 01:17:18,247
Hey! Stop him.

1171
01:18:47,826 --> 01:18:49,825
You said didn't see how a
police station looks like.

1172
01:18:49,955 --> 01:18:52,373
Look, this is how a police
station looks from outside.

1173
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:55,415
Now, let me take you to a
tour inside the police station.

1174
01:18:55,943 --> 01:18:57,313
Look... Come on, look.

1175
01:18:59,054 --> 01:19:00,374
Take a proper look around, Kitty.

1176
01:19:00,467 --> 01:19:02,131
This is how an interior of
the police station looks like.

1177
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:03,424
Are you looking or not? Come on, look.

1178
01:19:03,521 --> 01:19:05,435
Come on, look. Take a good look.

1179
01:19:07,228 --> 01:19:09,662
This is how it looks
when you are locked up.

1180
01:19:10,001 --> 01:19:12,264
Remember the name of the
person who locked you up!

1181
01:19:12,526 --> 01:19:13,565
It is Shankar.

1182
01:19:13,672 --> 01:19:16,220
Potharaju Veera Shankar.

1183
01:19:16,595 --> 01:19:21,889
You have to pee in your pants when
you think about One Town station, rascal!

1184
01:19:25,669 --> 01:19:28,766
So, he has hit you there and
you have ended up in this jail.

1185
01:19:29,166 --> 01:19:33,121
No, brother. The real turmoil
between us started only then.

1186
01:19:36,413 --> 01:19:37,441
-Sir, tea.
-Give it to him.

1187
01:19:37,791 --> 01:19:40,816
Yellamanda, he's not someone who flees
but someone who bashes till one pees.

1188
01:19:41,078 --> 01:19:43,546
I agree, Gulabi.
He is no ordinary guy.

1189
01:19:43,746 --> 01:19:46,941
He has locked up Katari Krishna on
a Friday depriving him of getting a bail

1190
01:19:47,016 --> 01:19:48,629
on Saturday and Sunday.

1191
01:19:48,643 --> 01:19:51,924
Today is the third day.
I can only imagine the hell he is seeing.

1192
01:19:59,439 --> 01:20:02,109
-I think she is Jayamma
-Needn't think, that's Jayamma indeed.

1193
01:20:04,054 --> 01:20:05,227
Is she here with lunch?

1194
01:20:05,427 --> 01:20:07,938
-Maybe she's got a bail.
-Oh! Come, let's see.

1195
01:20:08,138 --> 01:20:10,289
-Return the glasses!
-We will do that tomorrow.

1196
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:12,236
Where is the SI?

1197
01:20:13,177 --> 01:20:13,842
Over there.

1198
01:20:23,749 --> 01:20:26,127
Hey, cop! Here are the bail papers.

1199
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:28,306
Open it! Open it! Open the cell.

1200
01:20:28,627 --> 01:20:29,811
Please wait for the CI to arrive.

1201
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:31,703
Hey! Why should I wait?

1202
01:20:31,903 --> 01:20:33,059
-Give me the keys! Give it!
-Madam.

1203
01:20:33,259 --> 01:20:34,631
-Open the cell or give it to me.
-Madam.

1204
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:35,702
-Give me the keys.
-Madam, please wait.

1205
01:20:35,902 --> 01:20:37,110
-Give the keys to me man!
-Madam, please.

1206
01:20:37,553 --> 01:20:38,599
[grunts]
[tyres screeching]

1207
01:20:47,873 --> 01:20:49,158
Tilak! Order a coffee for me.

1208
01:20:52,652 --> 01:20:55,709
How come he ignores so
many people present here?

1209
01:20:55,909 --> 01:20:58,266
Calm down, madam.
Getting bail is our priority.

1210
01:20:58,466 --> 01:21:01,761
If he overhears you,
he'll extend Krishna's lock up for a week.

1211
01:21:02,212 --> 01:21:03,778
Sir, please tell him.

1212
01:21:08,368 --> 01:21:09,803
Sir... the bail papers.

1213
01:21:28,847 --> 01:21:30,173
Hey Kitty!

1214
01:21:40,309 --> 01:21:45,945
I locked you up for three days just
because you are a third suspect in the FIR

1215
01:21:46,145 --> 01:21:48,206
that was filed 10 years ago
in Kandukuru Police station.

1216
01:21:48,922 --> 01:21:54,362
But if it turns out that you are behind
the murder of our constable Kiran,

1217
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:58,709
I'll make you stand stark naked
on a busy street of Ongole...

1218
01:21:59,020 --> 01:22:02,008
and stuff molten lead in
all your openings, rascal!

1219
01:22:02,803 --> 01:22:03,785
Get lost!

1220
01:22:17,010 --> 01:22:18,625
-[overlap of voices] Sir... Sir...
-Hey! Out of the way!

1221
01:22:19,562 --> 01:22:20,349
Rama Krishna!

1222
01:22:20,995 --> 01:22:23,110
-Out of the way! Out of the way!
-Move...

1223
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:02,177
We fell in love with each other.

1224
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:06,295
But I've been scared of you all these
days and refrained from getting married.

1225
01:23:07,068 --> 01:23:10,201
But now, a real man has come to
this town and he is in this station.

1226
01:23:11,852 --> 01:23:14,158
That courage has made me
stand boldly in front of you.

1227
01:23:41,970 --> 01:23:44,927
We have killed the guy she fell in
love with! Then, who the hell is he?

1228
01:23:45,127 --> 01:23:46,028
What happened?

1229
01:23:49,367 --> 01:23:50,748
Something went wrong, Krishna.

1230
01:23:51,736 --> 01:23:52,542
There's been a mistake, sir.

1231
01:23:53,944 --> 01:23:55,515
I and Nitya fell in love with each other.

1232
01:24:02,222 --> 01:24:03,881
<i>Our love is the reason
for Kiran's death sir.</i>

1233
01:24:04,701 --> 01:24:07,957
<i>Kiran accompanied us to
the movie on that day sir.</i>

1234
01:24:08,971 --> 01:24:11,311
I was supposed to die, instead of Kiran.

1235
01:24:13,506 --> 01:24:15,871
It was me who was supposed
to drop Nitya, sir.

1236
01:24:16,171 --> 01:24:17,427
That was a good film.
Makes a good watch.

1237
01:24:17,627 --> 01:24:19,009
That heroine performed very well!

1238
01:24:22,765 --> 01:24:23,362
[groans in pain]

1239
01:24:23,647 --> 01:24:25,109
-What happened Balaji?
-Ah!

1240
01:24:25,767 --> 01:24:27,027
What happened, dude?

1241
01:24:27,602 --> 01:24:28,555
Come let us go to a hospital.

1242
01:24:28,755 --> 01:24:31,457
No need man, first drop Nitya at her home.

1243
01:24:31,657 --> 01:24:32,461
-Hey!
-Well...

1244
01:24:32,562 --> 01:24:33,950
She will end up in trouble
if she reaches home late.

1245
01:24:34,150 --> 01:24:35,217
-Go with him.
-OK, go to a hospital.

1246
01:24:35,417 --> 01:24:36,373
-Come.
-I will take care.

1247
01:24:36,573 --> 01:24:38,184
-You go.
-Fine, take care.

1248
01:24:47,982 --> 01:24:49,924
If I wouldn't have got hurt by the nail,

1249
01:24:50,124 --> 01:24:52,246
Kiran wouldn't have
gone to drop Nitya sir.

1250
01:24:53,128 --> 01:24:56,748
Jayamma saw them and thought
that it was Kiran who loved Nitya.

1251
01:24:59,222 --> 01:25:01,968
And Krishna's men have
brutally killed Kiran, sir.

1252
01:25:06,455 --> 01:25:09,340
I was scared that they will
kill me too, if this comes out.

1253
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:12,410
So I didn't tell this to
anyone until now, sir.

1254
01:25:14,213 --> 01:25:17,318
But when you hit Krishna the other day,
I've mustered the courage.

1255
01:25:17,518 --> 01:25:19,339
So, I married her and came to you, sir.

1256
01:25:20,894 --> 01:25:21,965
I am sorry, sir.

1257
01:25:25,845 --> 01:25:27,158
I am the witness for the incident, sir.

1258
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:29,360
Say the same thing in the statement.

1259
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:30,087
-Tilak!
-Sir?

1260
01:25:30,187 --> 01:25:32,675
Get the station warrant ready.
I'll drag him from inside his home...

1261
01:25:32,786 --> 01:25:33,723
Sir...

1262
01:25:34,026 --> 01:25:35,736
If you don't mind, I have a suggestion.

1263
01:25:35,936 --> 01:25:39,222
He will go legally citing the deceased
and the witness being cops.

1264
01:25:39,322 --> 01:25:41,936
No matter how many times we lock
him up without strong evidence,

1265
01:25:42,127 --> 01:25:43,690
he'll somehow escape.

1266
01:25:44,371 --> 01:25:48,278
Either we should get a strong
evidence or he must do a mistake.

1267
01:25:48,478 --> 01:25:49,569
Let us wait until then, sir.

1268
01:25:49,769 --> 01:25:51,354
Do we need to wait
until he commits a mistake?

1269
01:25:51,554 --> 01:25:53,046
I will make him commit it.

1270
01:25:53,813 --> 01:25:56,345
Only the people in this station know
that his daughter got married to Balaji.

1271
01:25:56,557 --> 01:25:57,638
The entire town should know this.

1272
01:25:57,838 --> 01:25:58,915
Put up the hoardings!

1273
01:26:00,952 --> 01:26:03,604
Hey, Gulabi! Look oh look! Look here...

1274
01:26:04,627 --> 01:26:05,333
Oh my God!

1275
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,665
Constable's wedding with
Katari Krishna's daughter.

1276
01:26:10,836 --> 01:26:14,516
By erecting this banner, he dented
Krishna's reputation permanently.

1277
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:22,087
Krishna, I came to the
town knowing the situation.

1278
01:26:22,775 --> 01:26:24,722
I felt very sad seeing
the hoardings in the town.

1279
01:26:24,922 --> 01:26:27,103
I wouldn't have let
this happen if I was here.

1280
01:26:27,791 --> 01:26:31,456
Don't worry. I will get him transferred
to some place using my influence.

1281
01:26:33,290 --> 01:26:35,638
-Where will you transfer him, sir?
-Wherever I can.

1282
01:26:35,838 --> 01:26:37,123
Guntur or Nellore.

1283
01:26:39,934 --> 01:26:41,371
Okay, let us think he has been transfered.

1284
01:26:42,489 --> 01:26:43,900
But do you know what people would think?

1285
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:48,988
They'd say, "C I Shankar has bashed
Katari Krishna like a dog in Ongole"

1286
01:26:49,188 --> 01:26:52,765
"And Krishna pleaded officers
to get him transferred here."

1287
01:26:54,678 --> 01:26:58,199
SP, I will only lost my reputation
when he raised his hand on me.

1288
01:26:58,399 --> 01:27:01,056
But I'll lose my life if he gets
transferred to some other district.

1289
01:27:05,042 --> 01:27:07,160
He should stay in the same station,
roam around in this town,

1290
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:09,961
I should chop him into pieces
in front of these people,

1291
01:27:14,273 --> 01:27:17,036
Chop him into pieces.

1292
01:27:22,617 --> 01:27:24,284
Why is his wife here strangely?

1293
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:30,273
Oh dear...

1294
01:27:32,695 --> 01:27:33,795
Mr. Krishna, see you.

1295
01:27:35,039 --> 01:27:38,075
She is our only daughter. Don't kill her.

1296
01:27:38,431 --> 01:27:40,459
I know how much you like her.

1297
01:27:41,131 --> 01:27:42,836
You will even kill the people
you like if they go against you.

1298
01:27:43,416 --> 01:27:45,096
Let my daughter live.

1299
01:27:45,790 --> 01:27:47,375
Please promise me
you wouldn't kill her.

1300
01:27:47,618 --> 01:27:48,551
[breaks into tears]

1301
01:27:49,091 --> 01:27:50,131
Promise me.

1302
01:27:58,666 --> 01:28:04,573
[singing]

1303
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:09,071
-Thank you very much.
-Congratulations.

1304
01:28:09,271 --> 01:28:09,892
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1305
01:28:13,244 --> 01:28:14,236
[in unison]: Greetings, sir.

1306
01:28:14,436 --> 01:28:15,437
-Good evening, sir.
-Very good evening!

1307
01:28:15,736 --> 01:28:17,245
-Hi sir!
-Hello, sir!

1308
01:28:18,208 --> 01:28:19,609
Hmm, what's up, Tilak?

1309
01:28:19,951 --> 01:28:21,272
-Is everything under control?
-Yes, sir.

1310
01:28:21,964 --> 01:28:22,889
Okay.

1311
01:28:23,089 --> 01:28:24,779
Are the men related to Kitty here?

1312
01:28:24,829 --> 01:28:28,461
-Most of them have come, sir.
-Most of them? Very good!

1313
01:28:30,704 --> 01:28:32,256
-Who are they?
-Local talent, sir.

1314
01:28:32,578 --> 01:28:36,280
Oh no! This isn't enough, can't hear the
sound at least till the end of the street.

1315
01:28:36,762 --> 01:28:41,011
Our noise here should
reverberate in Kitty's ears.

1316
01:28:41,389 --> 01:28:43,332
What?
Clear them all from here and...

1317
01:28:43,781 --> 01:28:44,496
[groans signalling]

1318
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:50,361
"Whenever there is a celebration around"

1319
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:54,484
"I'm always the first guest"

1320
01:28:55,213 --> 01:28:58,320
"In the middle of thumping beats..."

1321
01:28:58,961 --> 01:29:02,053
"My solo song is a must"

1322
01:29:02,503 --> 01:29:03,794
All the best!

1323
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:18,229
"I was born in Chimakurthy"

1324
01:29:18,584 --> 01:29:21,295
"Attained my youth in Chinaganjam"

1325
01:29:22,061 --> 01:29:24,349
"I spread my beauty around"

1326
01:29:24,511 --> 01:29:27,279
"I left both the Telugu states shaken"

1327
01:29:27,994 --> 01:29:30,882
"It's the same old thing
that happens everywhere"

1328
01:29:31,082 --> 01:29:33,875
"Everyone moves towards me
irrespective of their age!"

1329
01:29:34,086 --> 01:29:36,727
"Unable to bear the trouble
and seeing their efforts"

1330
01:29:37,404 --> 01:29:39,475
"I threw some flying kisses around"

1331
01:29:40,071 --> 01:29:42,886
[throwing flying kisses]

1332
01:29:43,134 --> 01:29:45,567
"The sound of my kisses creates a boom"

1333
01:29:45,893 --> 01:29:48,576
"I'll give you one too, stay lined up"

1334
01:29:48,985 --> 01:29:51,596
"The sound of my kisses creates a boom"

1335
01:29:52,058 --> 01:29:54,764
"I'm the most happening one nowadays"

01:30:00,785 --> 01:30:03,312

our Latha Lakshmi from Tangutur"

and is making me younger"

1342

"Let me come up on stage and
put a garland of notes on you"

1343

is a lucky chance for you"

keep scoring all night"

they make you better than beauty queens"

I pray to God that both of
should have a long and happy life.

1365
01:33:11,076 --> 01:33:12,479
Please leave this town for some time.

1366
01:33:13,602 --> 01:33:15,131
I know about your father.

1367
01:33:15,331 --> 01:33:16,572
He isn't human.

1368
01:33:17,349 --> 01:33:19,604
I wish that you should live happily
with your husband, wherever you are.

1369
01:33:20,589 --> 01:33:21,546
Leave this town.

1370
01:33:21,746 --> 01:33:24,286
You don't worry.
I am there for them.

1371
01:33:24,818 --> 01:33:27,499
Was this wedding for the sake of their
happiness or your adamant move?

1372
01:33:28,654 --> 01:33:31,706
I can't live if I lose my
daughter in your disputes.

1373
01:33:35,939 --> 01:33:38,992
I am asking you as a
mother. Please understand.

1374
01:33:39,430 --> 01:33:40,726
Send them to some place.

1375
01:33:40,826 --> 01:33:42,617
I married your daughter,
after being prepared for everything.

1376
01:33:42,788 --> 01:33:44,889
Balaji, she is right.

1377
01:33:45,089 --> 01:33:47,629
You both shouldn't suffer because
of my disputes with her father.

1378
01:33:48,448 --> 01:33:49,963
I will send them out of town tonight.

1379
01:33:50,783 --> 01:33:53,941
I am leaving it by trusting you.
Please send them out of town personally.

1380
01:33:54,541 --> 01:33:55,611
You can be assured.

1381
01:33:57,558 --> 01:33:58,512
Mom...

1382
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:05,849
Where have you been?

1383
01:34:09,365 --> 01:34:10,264
I am asking you!

1384
01:34:11,909 --> 01:34:13,039
Where are you coming from?

1385
01:34:18,691 --> 01:34:20,948
Do you know that a wife is
called Sahadharmacharini.

1386
01:34:21,358 --> 01:34:23,787
Which means,
I should share half of your duties.

1387
01:34:24,813 --> 01:34:27,566
I brought your daughter, her husband

1388
01:34:27,766 --> 01:34:29,486
and that cop at one place.

1389
01:34:29,882 --> 01:34:31,138
Now prove that you are a man enough.

1390
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:34,765
Women have children with
their husbands in this town.

1391
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:37,517
But I thought that my
daughter was born to a real man.

1392
01:34:38,146 --> 01:34:39,564
Your manliness is mine.

1393
01:34:40,081 --> 01:34:43,486
Hack the one who hit you and the
guy who married your daughter.

1394
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,585
Bring back your lost honour
and my daughter.

Okay, sir.

1402
01:35:43,157 --> 01:35:46,947

1423
01:39:36,179 --> 01:39:37,887
Call your wife, man!

01:39:41,766 --> 01:39:44,619
Oh my Goodness! You look so
innocent like actress Sridevi.

1427
01:39:44,819 --> 01:39:46,204
But you hatch plots like Bandit Queen.

1428
01:39:47,454 --> 01:39:51,678
I am asking you as a mother, you
should save my daughter's husband.

1429
01:39:51,878 --> 01:39:53,066
Please, son. Please.

1430

1431
01:39:54,257 --> 01:39:56,816
What a realistic performance! Hats off!

1432
01:39:57,312 --> 01:40:00,155
Hey, Kitty... your wife is a big actress!

1433
01:40:00,355 --> 01:40:04,058
Try her in movies. You can live
happily managing her schedules.

1434
01:40:04,269 --> 01:40:05,612
Why do you need rowdyism?

1435

Dacoit bastard!

1436
01:40:07,748 --> 01:40:10,660
Hey! You are still alive because
your time is running good.

1437
01:40:10,860 --> 01:40:14,481
Huh! It's not because my time is running
good. It is because yours is running bad.

1438
01:40:15,872 --> 01:40:19,557
Killing people is one of your needs,
but it is one of my responsibilities.

1439
01:40:20,102 --> 01:40:21,336
You might have a weapon at home.

1440
01:40:21,536 --> 01:40:24,425
But it comes inbuilt with my uniform.

1441
01:40:24,789 --> 01:40:28,595
A cop gets trained
not to pull his gun out.

1442
01:40:28,988 --> 01:40:33,240
But if he takes it out, it will be a
sure shot. There is no doubt about it.

1443
01:40:34,224 --> 01:40:35,950
He will blow your brains out.

-Hey you!

01:40:39,470 --> 01:40:40,559
What's with you?

1446
01:40:40,574 --> 01:40:43,109
You are not a match to fight with me.

1447
01:40:43,309 --> 01:40:45,686
If the people outside come to know that
I have hit you, they'd crack jokes at me.

1448
01:40:45,886 --> 01:40:47,288
I'd assign you an easy task.

1449
01:40:47,736 --> 01:40:48,899
Bring that chair and keep it here.

1450
01:40:51,404 --> 01:40:52,675
Now go and stand in your position.

01:40:59,883 --> 01:41:01,855
Your daughter, for whom you have
planned these activities for,

1453
01:41:02,255 --> 01:41:05,733
would be having her first night
with our constable, today...

1454
01:41:07,519 --> 01:41:08,265

1455
01:41:09,838 --> 01:41:10,840

I'd book a taxi if you want to come alone.

1457
01:41:15,403 --> 01:41:17,439
I'll book a lorry,
if you want to come with your men.

1458
01:41:18,107 --> 01:41:19,083
Come there!

1459
01:41:20,153 --> 01:41:21,104

me from this moment.

Now, you are my only target from now.

1463
01:41:32,273 --> 01:41:34,691
I will think about her
only after killing you.

1464
01:41:35,574 --> 01:41:39,999
If I don't hack you and hang
you at the Addanki Bus Station,

1465
01:41:40,569 --> 01:41:42,122
my name wouldn't be
Katari Krishna anymore.

You proved yourself as a real man now!

1469
01:41:51,194 --> 01:41:53,331
Be prepared to change your name.

1470
01:41:53,806 --> 01:41:57,155
It won't be Katari Krishna anymore.
It would be 'Saree-Krishna'.

1471

Alright! Shall I leave now? Okay!

1472
01:42:15,618 --> 01:42:17,033
Speak out! Speak out!

It's okay, Tilak.
Did Srinu speak anything or not?

I don't understand what he's
been eating and drinking, sir.

1475
01:42:25,729 --> 01:42:28,182
Though I have bashed him for
three days breaking thirty batons

1476
01:42:28,401 --> 01:42:30,450
but he didn't utter a word.

1477
01:42:39,385 --> 01:42:42,249
Ah, Tilak...
you bashed him very badly.

1478
01:42:50,809 --> 01:42:52,168
Hmm, Srinu now tell me.

1479
01:42:52,878 --> 01:42:55,335

Aren't you going to a movie?

Tsk! Forget movies, Krishna!

1492
01:44:00,244 --> 01:44:04,222
After seeing you in this situation,
I don't feel like watching movies.

1493
01:44:04,422 --> 01:44:07,596
I am freaking scared that
Srinu might divulge about you.

1494

He didn't.

I will watch the movie later.

If she gets caught, cops will torture
her until she reveals my name.

tolerate her being tortured.

reveals my name, as well.

01:46:37,519 --> 01:46:38,401
I wonder if Krishna is safe.

1543
01:46:39,383 --> 01:46:41,046
[telephone rings]

1544
01:46:41,475 --> 01:46:43,477
Why isn't Krishna answering my call?

1545
01:46:48,370 --> 01:46:48,944
[mobile rings]

1546
01:46:49,845 --> 01:46:50,785
What happened to Krishna?

1547
01:46:50,985 --> 01:46:53,588
Jayamma,
Krishna assigned Ankadu to kill you.

1548
01:46:53,788 --> 01:46:55,526
-What?
-They are out to kill you.

1549
01:46:55,726 --> 01:46:57,796
[Ankadu]: Krishna would be safe Jayamma.

1550
01:47:08,671 --> 01:47:11,150
Hey, Ankadu!
Why are you guys roaming outside?

1551
01:47:11,350 --> 01:47:12,609
[siren wailing]

1552
01:47:15,367 --> 01:47:17,355
The cops are here. You
will get caught. Run away.

1553
01:47:24,857 --> 01:47:26,948
Why are you guys standing still?

1554
01:47:27,233 --> 01:47:28,473
Go to our Vetapalem.

1555
01:47:46,265 --> 01:47:49,235
What is it, guys? Run away.

1556
01:47:49,788 --> 01:47:51,809
Krishna ordered us to kill you, Jayamma.

1557
01:48:01,085 --> 01:48:01,979
[groans]

1558
01:48:14,955 --> 01:48:16,361
Balaji! Tilak!

1559
01:48:53,375 --> 01:48:54,122
[Ankadu groans]

1560
01:48:54,307 --> 01:48:54,832
[shot fired]

1561
01:49:01,538 --> 01:49:06,403
[commotion]

1562
01:49:15,224 --> 01:49:17,110
[voice muted]

1563
01:49:20,230 --> 01:49:23,980
[voice muted]

1564
01:49:32,737 --> 01:49:35,326
[commotion continues]

1565
01:49:37,030 --> 01:49:41,607
Yeah, okay. Alright!

1566
01:49:49,299 --> 01:49:50,988
The game has begun, Shankar.

1567
01:49:51,538 --> 01:49:53,800
Katari Krishna has regained his form now.

1568
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,404
I will play with the uniform on your body,

1569
01:49:57,912 --> 01:50:00,556
I will play with the trust
of Ongole people have on you.

1570
01:50:02,229 --> 01:50:03,364
[mobile rings]

1571
01:50:04,683 --> 01:50:05,707
Hey, Kathi!

1572
01:50:06,057 --> 01:50:08,280
CI Shankar has killed a
person who belongs to your caste.

1573
01:50:08,594 --> 01:50:09,817
What you will do now?

1574
01:50:10,017 --> 01:50:12,781
I was waiting for the
chance. I got him now.

1575
01:50:13,174 --> 01:50:16,093
I'll set the entire town on fire and
I will show the power of my caste.

1576
01:50:31,329 --> 01:50:32,242
VEERA SHANKAR SHOULD BE PUNISHED

1577
01:50:55,917 --> 01:51:00,667
<i>An innocent civilian lost his life in the
shootout today near Navabharat theatre.</i>

1578
01:51:01,915 --> 01:51:06,586
<i>Caste-based and political groups are
agitating to arrrest C. I. Shankar...</i>

1579
01:51:06,786 --> 01:51:08,554
<i>and the entire Ongole town is hot.</i>

1580
01:51:10,362 --> 01:51:14,674
<i>There are protests and roadblocks in
town condemning CI Shankar's negligence.</i>

1581
01:51:14,910 --> 01:51:17,949
<i>The human rights organisation
has called for a lockdown,</i>

1582
01:51:18,149 --> 01:51:21,125
<i>and has also released a bulletin
questioning the Police system,</i>

1583
01:51:21,325 --> 01:51:26,570
<i>and wrote a letter to the State Home
Ministry seeking action on CI Shankar.</i>

1584
01:51:27,657 --> 01:51:28,552
<i>How would government react--</i>

1585
01:51:30,187 --> 01:51:32,010
[sighs] What is this, Shankar?

1586
01:51:32,461 --> 01:51:35,101
Don't you know how careful you should
be when using a gun in the public?

1587
01:51:35,301 --> 01:51:37,139
Sir, I shot the suspect.

1588
01:51:37,510 --> 01:51:39,212
But the one who is dead is an innocent.

1589
01:51:39,412 --> 01:51:41,481
The people, who whistled
when you have bashed Krishna,

1590
01:51:41,681 --> 01:51:43,706
are now angrily waiting
to pelt stones at you.

1591
01:51:43,906 --> 01:51:44,540
What is this?

1592
01:51:44,785 --> 01:51:46,548
You have hit the CI in the
Kandukuru police station.

1593
01:51:47,131 --> 01:51:49,261
You have bashed Katari Krishna
in the name of enquiry.

1594
01:51:49,361 --> 01:51:52,122
You have tortured Guntur Srinu in the
name of interrogation. And he is dead now.

1595
01:51:52,634 --> 01:51:55,539
And now,
you shot a young guy in the public.

1596
01:51:57,631 --> 01:52:01,055
I gave you a free hand as you have
caught Saleem, but you've misused it.

1597
01:52:01,509 --> 01:52:04,781
You kept doing mistakes
because of your emotions.

1598
01:52:04,981 --> 01:52:06,293
Now, I got the orders
from higher officials,

1599
01:52:07,213 --> 01:52:08,282
to suspend you.

1600
01:52:09,090 --> 01:52:10,717
-What you want me to do now?
-I am sorry, sir.

1601
01:52:16,892 --> 01:52:19,060
A commission would come for
an enquiry on you, next week.

1602
01:52:19,260 --> 01:52:20,020
Sir.

1603
01:52:20,274 --> 01:52:21,328
Give your explaination there.

1604
01:52:22,033 --> 01:52:22,773
You may go now.

1605
01:52:31,104 --> 01:52:32,990
-Namasthe, sir.
-Needn't salute him.

1606
01:52:33,190 --> 01:52:34,555
Hand down.

1607
01:52:34,755 --> 01:52:39,429
When one keeps beating anyone in
their path, because of the uniform,

1608
01:52:39,677 --> 01:52:42,901
this would be the expected
result... automatically.

1609
01:52:46,747 --> 01:52:48,377
-They have suspended him.
-He might hear it.

1610
01:52:48,596 --> 01:52:50,945
-[scoffs] Let him listen.
-Is that okay?

1611
01:52:51,145 --> 01:52:53,383
-What is the case?
-We gave foot in mouth statement.

1612
01:52:53,833 --> 01:52:56,948
-Unknowing misbehaviour with SPs relative.
-Yelavanda.

1613
01:53:01,510 --> 01:53:03,669
Oh my goodness! It's you.

1614
01:53:04,382 --> 01:53:05,910
It's Mr. Shankar!

1615
01:53:08,133 --> 01:53:11,850
I thought you are some home guard
as you don't have a hat and a belt.

1616
01:53:15,125 --> 01:53:17,740
By the way... What was it that
you were blabbering the other day?

1617
01:53:18,264 --> 01:53:23,766
Ah! A cop gets trained not to use his gun.

1618
01:53:25,248 --> 01:53:28,235
As this would be the result if he does?
I got it.

1619
01:53:28,875 --> 01:53:32,179
In my childhood,
my Telugu teacher too had a catchphrase.

1620
01:53:32,668 --> 01:53:35,795
'When success starts showing up,
everything keeps coming one by one'

1621
01:53:36,229 --> 01:53:39,582
'But when losing begins,
everything would be lost at one go.'

1622
01:53:41,093 --> 01:53:42,760
Now, you lost your uniform.

1623
01:53:43,481 --> 01:53:45,774
All that is left now is
your head resting on your neck.

1624
01:53:46,457 --> 01:53:47,312
I will remove it too.

1625
01:53:48,446 --> 01:53:49,803
And I will drink your blood.

1626
01:53:55,636 --> 01:53:57,009
Hey, Kitty!

1627
01:53:57,261 --> 01:54:01,397
Do you think my head is a
tender coconut for anyone to cut it,

1628
01:54:01,597 --> 01:54:04,337
and my blood is coconut
water for anyone to drink?

1629
01:54:05,412 --> 01:54:07,024
Bloody dacoit!

1630
01:54:11,198 --> 01:54:12,280
I gave you a small break.

1631
01:54:12,925 --> 01:54:15,484
Do whatever you want to do in this break.

1632
01:54:16,257 --> 01:54:17,736
I will come back with breaking news.

1633
01:54:27,826 --> 01:54:30,584
Uhuh! He still hasn't got
rid of his hot-headed nature.

1634
01:54:36,490 --> 01:54:41,925
[television playing]
[kid laughing]

1635
01:54:47,380 --> 01:54:48,026
-Dear...
-[kid laughing]

1636
01:54:48,126 --> 01:54:48,933
Lower the TV volume.

1637
01:54:51,906 --> 01:54:52,453
Tsk!

1638
01:55:05,398 --> 01:55:08,688
[kid laughing]

1639
01:55:09,240 --> 01:55:10,249
-Hey!
-[gasps]

1640
01:55:10,806 --> 01:55:12,369
Can't you understand?
Go inside!

1641
01:55:15,363 --> 01:55:16,231
Go!

1642
01:55:16,923 --> 01:55:21,445
Mom!
[weeping]

1643
01:55:23,029 --> 01:55:26,475
What did the kid do?
I am asking you what did he do!

1644
01:55:29,316 --> 01:55:31,231
This anger is the very
reason a life is lost.

1645
01:55:32,555 --> 01:55:34,696
And now, you are venting that on our kid?

1646
01:55:34,869 --> 01:55:36,535
So... Are you blaming me too?

1647
01:55:36,853 --> 01:55:38,956
I am not saying you did it intentionally.

1648
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:40,725
But it happened because of you!

1649
01:55:40,822 --> 01:55:41,941
-Kalyani!
-[gasps]

1650
01:55:54,592 --> 01:55:55,198
Huh!

1651
01:55:56,907 --> 01:55:57,674
You've known me for so long.

1652
01:55:57,823 --> 01:55:59,646
When you don't understand me,
how would the outsiders do?

1653
01:56:02,628 --> 01:56:07,281
My Shankar isn't the regular guy who vents
his frustration at his wife and children.

1654
01:56:09,266 --> 01:56:10,321
If you are the same old Shankar,

1655
01:56:10,537 --> 01:56:12,822
you wouldn't be worried
about your lost job.

1656
01:56:14,386 --> 01:56:16,611
You would think about
the life that was lost.

1657
01:56:19,346 --> 01:56:21,379
I don't know how he died.

1658
01:56:21,617 --> 01:56:24,224
But your aggression has been
killing your rational thinking.

1659
01:56:26,219 --> 01:56:27,591
The mistake had happened at your end.

1660
01:56:28,154 --> 01:56:29,728
You should know how it happened.

1661
01:56:30,168 --> 01:56:32,152
Not knowing is also your mistake.

1662
01:56:33,623 --> 01:56:36,461
Being a police officer, you should
find out whose mistake it was.

1663
01:56:36,580 --> 01:56:37,901
Whether it might be
yours or someone else's.

1664
01:56:39,791 --> 01:56:43,492
Being your wife, I should stay
with you in this situation.

1665
01:56:44,154 --> 01:56:45,855
But look how scared he is.

1666
01:56:47,140 --> 01:56:49,756
You shouldn't look like a
father who has done a mistake.

1667
01:56:51,855 --> 01:56:53,826
Show up after correcting the mistake.

1668
01:56:56,529 --> 01:56:58,494
Kalyani... Kalyani...

1669
01:57:21,955 --> 01:57:25,563
<i>If you were the same old Shankar, you
wouldn't be worried about the lost job.</i>

1670
01:57:26,395 --> 01:57:28,469
<i>You would think about
the life which is lost.</i>

1671
01:57:29,995 --> 01:57:32,712
<i>Being a cop you should find
out whose mistake is this.</i>

1672
01:57:32,912 --> 01:57:34,421
<i>Whether it might be
yours or someone else's.</i>

1673
01:57:44,111 --> 01:57:46,059
[electricity crackling]
[gun shots]

1674
01:57:55,915 --> 01:57:57,870
[electricity crackling]
[gun shots]

1675
01:58:08,709 --> 01:58:11,611
<i>I aimed at his leg.</i>
[gun shots]

1676
01:58:12,208 --> 01:58:13,590
<i>But the bullet hit his chest.</i>

1677
01:58:14,311 --> 01:58:16,471
<i>There is no chance
the bullet would bounce.</i>

1678
01:58:34,881 --> 01:58:37,598
<i>This is the 9mm bullet I fired!</i>

1679
01:58:37,874 --> 01:58:40,432
<i>How did a bullet of same
guage hit the young man?</i>

1680
01:58:40,820 --> 01:58:41,852
<i>Something is wrong!</i>

1681
01:58:45,631 --> 01:58:46,700
Constables!

1682
01:58:50,211 --> 01:58:52,032
Sai, go get the ammunition record.

1683
01:58:53,734 --> 01:58:55,597
What are you looking at? Go, get it!

1684
01:59:13,444 --> 01:59:14,310
Yes!

1685
01:59:14,510 --> 01:59:17,960
I have fired a bullet and there is one
more bullet missing in the record.

1686
01:59:18,422 --> 01:59:20,250
Where did it go wrong? Huh?

1687
01:59:20,776 --> 01:59:21,951
I am asking you!

1688
01:59:22,654 --> 01:59:23,662
Why aren't you silent?

1689
01:59:23,862 --> 01:59:25,001
-Sir?
-Tilak.

1690
01:59:25,201 --> 01:59:26,132
Why are you here, sir?

1691
01:59:26,332 --> 01:59:28,797
You were with me that day.
We both were carrying weapons.

1692
01:59:29,328 --> 01:59:31,550
One bullet was found on the spot but
from where did the other bullet come from?

1693
01:59:32,114 --> 01:59:34,311
How can it be possible sir?
The bullet you fired is in the dead body.

1694
01:59:34,597 --> 01:59:36,496
Even the same was
confirmed in the postmortem report.

1695
01:59:36,614 --> 01:59:38,716
Tilak I am not asking about
the bullet found in the body.

1696
01:59:39,054 --> 01:59:42,067
I am asking about the bullet which has
been missing in the station. Where is it?

1697
01:59:43,982 --> 01:59:46,052
-Give me your gun.
-Why do you need my gun, sir?

1698
01:59:46,600 --> 01:59:48,581
-Tilak, give your gun for once.
-Sir, please.

1699
01:59:48,738 --> 01:59:50,867
Why are you requesting me,
when I'm asking for your gun?

1700
01:59:51,011 --> 01:59:52,978
Tilak, hey! Tilak, stop there.

1701
01:59:53,570 --> 01:59:55,159
[groans]

1702
02:00:03,385 --> 02:00:04,463
Bloody villian!

1703
02:00:05,123 --> 02:00:06,654
[groans in pain]

1704
02:00:07,881 --> 02:00:09,636
You deceived me being by my side!

1705
02:00:13,422 --> 02:00:15,190
Why did you shoot that guy?

1706
02:00:16,382 --> 02:00:17,186
Speak out!

1707
02:00:17,486 --> 02:00:19,599
I will say it, I will sir.

1708
02:00:20,768 --> 02:00:21,946
To kill Ankadu.

1709
02:00:22,277 --> 02:00:23,555
Why did you think of killing Ankadu?

1710
02:00:24,193 --> 02:00:25,639
[Tilak groans]

1711
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:28,136
Tell me, tell me!

1712
02:00:28,932 --> 02:00:31,431
Jayamma's name came up
because of Guntur Srinu.

1713
02:00:32,285 --> 02:00:34,383
I shot Ankadu while he was
running after killing Jayamma,

1714
02:00:35,101 --> 02:00:37,849
to prevent Krishna's
name from coming out sir.

1715
02:00:44,244 --> 02:00:47,123
[electricity crackling]
[gun shots]

1716
02:00:48,362 --> 02:00:51,512
But the bullet hit that
guy by mistake and he died.

1717
02:00:52,757 --> 02:00:56,800
It's me who leaked info to Krishna about
every movement in this station, sir.

1718
02:00:57,876 --> 02:00:59,031
Guntur Srinu has opened his mouth.

1719
02:01:00,937 --> 02:01:02,130
He revealed Jayamma's name, sir.

1720
02:01:02,381 --> 02:01:03,794
Alright, I will take care.

1721
02:01:04,303 --> 02:01:08,094
Mr. Krishna, Shankar has been suspended.

1722
02:01:09,991 --> 02:01:13,905
Krishna's men are present in every
police station of Ongole district, sir.

1723
02:01:16,284 --> 02:01:17,920
Just like me in this station.

1724
02:01:18,988 --> 02:01:21,156
Hiding every FIR filed on Krishna,

1725
02:01:21,941 --> 02:01:25,843
and killing any witnesses
against Krishna, is our work sir.

1726
02:01:26,043 --> 02:01:27,809
[chocking]

1727
02:01:33,347 --> 02:01:35,494
Where did you hide the remaining FIR's,
Tilak?

1728
02:01:37,314 --> 02:01:38,284
Tell me, Tilak!

1729
02:01:40,768 --> 02:01:42,648
Where did you hide them? Take them out.

1730
02:01:46,584 --> 02:01:47,367
Take them out!

1731
02:01:58,035 --> 02:02:01,592
If I wouldn't hide them, Krishna
might have killed me long ago, sir.

1732
02:02:03,161 --> 02:02:04,859
Would you tell the
same thing before SP sir?

1733
02:02:05,996 --> 02:02:06,888
Will you?

1734
02:02:07,563 --> 02:02:09,096
Yes, yes.

1735
02:02:09,296 --> 02:02:12,484
[mobile ringing]

1736
02:02:13,927 --> 02:02:15,746
-Hello?
-Hey, Shankar!

1737
02:02:16,339 --> 02:02:19,923
Though you aren't wearing a uniform,
you have proved that you are a cop.

1738
02:02:20,486 --> 02:02:21,526
It's alright,

1739
02:02:21,726 --> 02:02:24,923
bring the policeman with you
along with the papers you have.

1740
02:02:25,234 --> 02:02:27,419
Hey, Kitty your jokes
are crossing boundaries!

1741
02:02:27,519 --> 02:02:29,629
You are asking them as
easily as my son asks candy.

1742
02:02:29,829 --> 02:02:32,241
I know that you are a hot-headed person.

1743
02:02:32,669 --> 02:02:34,030
and you won't listen to me.

1744
02:02:35,298 --> 02:02:39,275
That is why I have sent my
men to kill your wife and son,

1745
02:02:39,644 --> 02:02:41,099
who went to her parental home.

1746
02:02:46,355 --> 02:02:48,172
If you don't come here now,

1747
02:02:48,612 --> 02:02:50,409
then they will start their work.

1748
02:02:50,637 --> 02:02:54,079
Krishna sir, Krishna sir,
please don't harm them, I beg you.

1749
02:02:54,279 --> 02:02:55,725
Please, please Krishna sir,

1750
02:02:56,063 --> 02:02:57,987
please don't harm my wife and son.

1751
02:02:58,178 --> 02:02:59,357
Ah? Oh!

1752
02:03:00,758 --> 02:03:03,131
He started calling me formally!

1753
02:03:04,296 --> 02:03:06,046
Shankar... Shankar.

1754
02:03:15,202 --> 02:03:18,625
Please Krishna sir, let both of us
settle it, spare my wife and kid.

1755
02:03:18,725 --> 02:03:21,746
Please Krishna sir...
Krishna sir... Krishna sir...

1756
02:03:21,799 --> 02:03:26,217
Krishna sir, hey, Kitty... Kitty...

1757
02:03:27,844 --> 02:03:30,124
Are you expecting that I would come
to your house and massage your feet,

1758
02:03:30,165 --> 02:03:34,289
to plead you out of fear?
You bloody flocker...

1759
02:03:36,938 --> 02:03:38,402
-Hey!
-Yes, tell me.

1760
02:03:39,050 --> 02:03:42,274
Why are you laughing when I said your
wife and son are going to die in sometime?

1761
02:03:50,809 --> 02:03:52,055
Are you out of your mind?

1762
02:03:52,602 --> 02:03:54,891
Or else do you remember any
catchphrase of the teacher?

1763
02:03:55,089 --> 02:03:56,754
Oh, I don't remember any quotes.

1764
02:03:56,954 --> 02:03:59,426
Hey, Kitty... shall I tell
you mind-blowing news?

1765
02:03:59,626 --> 02:04:00,172
What's that?

1766
02:04:00,501 --> 02:04:02,502
-Do I say it?
-Hey, tell me!

1767
02:04:09,766 --> 02:04:10,800
[metal clinks]

1768
02:04:12,198 --> 02:04:13,107
Mom!

1769
02:04:19,666 --> 02:04:20,537
Shh!

1770
02:04:35,038 --> 02:04:35,940
Do you think my wife is someone...

1771
02:04:36,140 --> 02:04:41,791
...who would sit at home getting
my kid ready to school and keep cooking?

1772
02:04:42,159 --> 02:04:47,554
She's a topper from the 2005 batch
trainees in the AP Police academy.

1773
02:05:09,030 --> 02:05:11,134
Moreover, she has attained
a black belt in Taekwando.

1774
02:05:33,522 --> 02:05:37,937
She has left her career for the sake
of her husband and yet to be born baby.

1775
02:05:38,023 --> 02:05:40,460
She is a lioness who's resting at home.

1776
02:06:08,629 --> 02:06:12,208
If I'm able to fight bloody
decoits like you outside,

1777
02:06:12,482 --> 02:06:14,061
that's because of the courage
of having her back home.

1778
02:06:36,134 --> 02:06:38,830
[groans]

1779
02:06:45,402 --> 02:06:47,634
Check out what is the
condition of your men once.

1780
02:06:47,988 --> 02:06:49,824
They'd already be in a screwed up state!

1781
02:07:01,081 --> 02:07:01,481
Hello?

1782
02:07:01,581 --> 02:07:03,729
Hello Dad!
Mom and I are safe!

1783
02:07:03,929 --> 02:07:06,609
Hey kiddo, I'm sorry for losing
my temper on you the other day.

1784
02:07:06,709 --> 02:07:09,369
No apologies in the family, Dad.
Take it easy.

1785
02:07:09,713 --> 02:07:11,773
-<i>Wait, Mom wants to speak.
</i>-Yeah, go ahead!

1786
02:07:14,683 --> 02:07:15,545
My goddess...

1787
02:07:15,803 --> 02:07:21,191
Their arrival here in search of us clearly
indicates that your success has started.

1788
02:07:21,482 --> 02:07:23,448
<i>Me and Chikku are coming back home.</i>

1789
02:07:23,923 --> 02:07:27,567
I'll prepare a strong
masala biryani for you.

1790
02:07:27,667 --> 02:07:29,205
I'm coming! On the way!

1791
02:07:29,422 --> 02:07:34,756
[chorus singing]

1792
02:07:51,406 --> 02:07:55,125
"Beautiful lioness, shapely gun"

1793
02:07:55,448 --> 02:07:58,784
"Naughty eyed girl flying free"

1794
02:07:59,150 --> 02:08:02,645
"Your hips resemble a fine pistol"

1795
02:08:02,932 --> 02:08:06,334
"Your dimpled cheeks have
the power of bullets"

1796
02:08:06,615 --> 02:08:10,292
"My duty would be with you at
home from now on, Sweetie!"

1797
02:08:10,715 --> 02:08:14,262
"My dear classy Kalyani,
serve me masala biryani"

1798
02:08:14,894 --> 02:08:17,930
"Biryani... biryani..."

1799
02:08:18,188 --> 02:08:21,703
"Oh my hot-headed prince,
get the family pack for yourself"

1800
02:08:22,356 --> 02:08:25,331
"Get it for yourself...
get it for yourself"

1801
02:08:25,505 --> 02:08:28,856
"Your macho ways would
make way for your victory"

1802
02:08:29,110 --> 02:08:32,678
"My fitness compliments your aggression"

1803
02:08:32,928 --> 02:08:36,377
"I would stay beside you as
a competition to your skills"

1804
02:08:36,675 --> 02:08:40,030
"I'll march a parade in your kitchen"

1805
02:08:40,230 --> 02:08:43,939
"Embrace me to make-up for the longing"

1806
02:08:44,477 --> 02:08:47,950
"My dear classy Kalyani,
serve me masala biryani"

1807
02:08:48,518 --> 02:08:51,532
"Biryani... biryani..."

1808
02:08:51,946 --> 02:08:55,498
"Oh my hot-headed prince,
get the family pack for yourself"

1809
02:08:55,971 --> 02:08:58,997
"Get it for yourself...
get it for yourself"

1810
02:08:59,197 --> 02:09:04,559
[chorus singing]

1811
02:09:36,298 --> 02:09:40,052
"-The handcuffs are ready.
-Let's wear them together."

1812
02:09:40,153 --> 02:09:43,703
"-There should be a prison.
-My girl's embrace does the job."

1813
02:09:43,827 --> 02:09:47,454
"-The man is on fire!
-The lady is ready too!"

1814
02:09:48,789 --> 02:09:52,032
"You always right like a siren..."

1815
02:09:52,275 --> 02:09:55,535
"...in the heart of your girl"

1816
02:09:56,059 --> 02:09:59,605
"You always stay close to me..."

1817
02:09:59,782 --> 02:10:02,694
"...like my uniform"

1818
02:10:02,829 --> 02:10:06,441
"Give me security for my beauty today"

1819
02:10:06,535 --> 02:10:10,141
"You got to stay on rounds like
the moon this entire night"

1820
02:10:10,321 --> 02:10:14,041
"I'll give you a hell lot
of kisses with love"

1821
02:10:14,491 --> 02:10:18,073

serve me masala biryani"

"Get it for yourself...
get it for yourself"

1825
02:10:29,255 --> 02:10:35,067
[chorus singing]

1826
02:10:55,307 --> 02:10:56,313
Take him into custody.

1827
02:11:02,364 --> 02:11:04,110
-So, you are back on the job.
-Sir.

1828
02:11:04,517 --> 02:11:07,936
You locked him behind the bars for
three days just for one FIR.

1829
02:11:08,136 --> 02:11:09,373
Now you have a bunch.

1830
02:11:09,573 --> 02:11:12,342
Every police station in this
district will be under you.

1831
02:11:13,080 --> 02:11:15,378
Every police man will be in your control.

1832
02:11:15,642 --> 02:11:17,383
I am giving you 48 hours of time.

1833
02:11:17,994 --> 02:11:23,680
Only one name either yours or Katari
Krishna's should be heard in Ongole.

1834
02:11:23,880 --> 02:11:25,258
-Yes, sir.
-Best of luck.

1835
02:11:27,570 --> 02:11:28,656
What have you guys done this time?

1836
02:11:28,745 --> 02:11:31,090
-Ah?
-We robbed bedsheets from DSP's house.

1837
02:11:31,337 --> 02:11:32,579
-Hey, Gulabi!
-Ah?

1838
02:11:32,679 --> 02:11:35,022
Who told you that Ongole's
bull was stolen by Brazilians?

1839
02:11:35,130 --> 02:11:36,087
-Who is it?
-Look there.

1840
02:11:42,432 --> 02:11:44,514
Hey, no one can stop a batsman in form

1841
02:11:44,957 --> 02:11:47,867
and a policeman in uniform.

1842
02:11:52,093 --> 02:11:55,492
-Now Katari gets his share.
-Of course.

1843
02:12:03,229 --> 02:12:03,907
[gun shot]

1844
02:12:07,633 --> 02:12:08,562
[gun shots]

1845
02:12:36,890 --> 02:12:38,232
[gun shots]

1846
02:12:42,655 --> 02:12:44,057
His total gang is finished, sir.

1847
02:12:44,357 --> 02:12:46,293
I heard the sound, what next?

1848
02:12:48,430 --> 02:12:49,098
SP...

1849
02:12:49,304 --> 02:12:51,181
Krishna, nothing is in my hand now.

1850
02:12:51,723 --> 02:12:54,728
Your SP has included my name in
your file and sent it to officials.

1851
02:12:55,458 --> 02:12:57,669
I will be at risk.
Don't call me hereafter.

1852
02:12:57,769 --> 02:13:01,206
Don't trouble me in just this
case brother, I beg you. See you.

1853
02:13:01,802 --> 02:13:02,730
Good riddance.

1854
02:13:02,837 --> 02:13:03,426
Hey!

1855
02:13:03,979 --> 02:13:05,741
These idiots should be drowned
in the Gundlakamma river!

1856
02:13:06,480 --> 02:13:09,018
No matter how many phone calls
you make, this is what you get.

1857
02:13:12,013 --> 02:13:15,765
Listen to me, let's flee the
town and go to some other place.

1858
02:13:15,865 --> 02:13:17,214
At least we will stay alive.

1859
02:13:17,362 --> 02:13:22,210
Hey, I will move anywhere,
only after seeing his death.

1860
02:13:22,489 --> 02:13:23,605
What will you watch?

1861
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:27,959
He shot all your men like birds,
leaving no one for you.

1862
02:13:28,539 --> 02:13:31,136
I don't need a man,
I'm fine with a husband.

1863
02:13:32,708 --> 02:13:33,850
[metal clinks]

1864
02:13:35,166 --> 02:13:38,417
When you don't accept me as a man
even after being with me for 25 years,

1865
02:13:38,662 --> 02:13:39,932
how would the village agree?

1866
02:13:55,174 --> 02:13:56,973
Potha Raju Veera Shankar!

1867
02:13:59,324 --> 02:14:01,496
Ankadu,
I have killed 25 people with this hand.

1868
02:14:02,548 --> 02:14:04,814
I didn't get any satisfaction
in any killing.

1869
02:14:06,472 --> 02:14:09,880
But I will get it now, with his death.

1870
02:14:11,868 --> 02:14:15,671
He will come, for sure he will
come here searching for me.

1871
02:14:15,935 --> 02:14:16,785
Let him come.

1872
02:14:16,967 --> 02:14:19,792
Will shall chase and
hunt him down with sickles.

1873
02:14:19,965 --> 02:14:21,409
Let that idiot come.

1874
02:14:38,192 --> 02:14:39,110
-Balaji.
-Sir?

1875
02:14:39,173 --> 02:14:40,071
Where is this light house located?

1876
02:14:40,558 --> 02:14:41,856
Sir, this is Vetalpalem.

1877
02:14:42,667 --> 02:14:43,756
Vetapalem.

1878
02:15:08,328 --> 02:15:09,523
Don't leave even one house unchecked!

1879
02:15:13,419 --> 02:15:14,487
Ask every single person.

1880
02:15:16,339 --> 02:15:18,018
-They'll be at She-oak plantation.
-She-oak plantation?

1881
02:15:18,218 --> 02:15:20,152
Yes, sir.
Casuarina plantation at the beach.

1882
02:17:54,811 --> 02:17:55,322
[weapon swishing]

1883
02:19:44,870 --> 02:19:45,663
[shot fired]

1884
02:19:47,631 --> 02:19:48,290
[shot fired]

1885
02:19:59,119 --> 02:20:01,806
[shot fired]

1886
02:21:47,996 --> 02:21:49,317
Hey!

1887
02:22:00,744 --> 02:22:02,106
[gun cocking]

1888
02:22:12,444 --> 02:22:13,338
[clicking tongue]

1889
02:22:15,112 --> 02:22:18,063
Ah! You've cleverly escaped
in the truck, brother.

1890
02:22:19,104 --> 02:22:20,510
Then, how come you have ended up here?

1891
02:22:20,712 --> 02:22:21,877
Because of this nail!

1892
02:22:24,679 --> 02:22:26,146
[tyres screeching]

1893
02:22:32,934 --> 02:22:36,000
[groans in pain]

1894
02:22:44,172 --> 02:22:48,741
No, please don't kill me... don't kill me.

1895
02:22:55,637 --> 02:22:56,485
What?

1896
02:22:56,804 --> 02:23:00,064
Didn't you challenge that you'd behead me
and hang my head at the Addanki Bus Stand?

1897
02:23:00,599 --> 02:23:03,749
Didn't you warn me that you suck my blood?

1898
02:23:04,417 --> 02:23:07,021
You have constantly blabbered about
background, what happened to that now?

1899
02:23:07,138 --> 02:23:08,219
What background is left with you now?

1900
02:23:10,122 --> 02:23:13,359
You've killed Jayamma who has put all
her faith in you, and your wife as well.

1901
02:23:13,729 --> 02:23:15,106
You have distanced your daughter.

1902
02:23:15,602 --> 02:23:18,081
Do you have anyone left
who would care for you?

1903
02:23:20,618 --> 02:23:22,949
Your bloody life is of no use now.

1904
02:23:24,948 --> 02:23:26,795
But I should mention
something in the records, Kitty.

1905
02:23:28,953 --> 02:23:31,137
If you shoot yourself with
this, it will be a suicide.

1906
02:23:31,679 --> 02:23:32,809
If I shoot you,

1907
02:23:34,408 --> 02:23:35,372
it would be called as encounter.

1908
02:23:35,572 --> 02:23:36,724
The decision is yours.

1909
02:23:37,467 --> 02:23:38,463
I'll surrender.

1910
02:23:41,020 --> 02:23:43,009
It just takes a second for him to kill me.

1911
02:23:44,470 --> 02:23:46,442
But he gave me the chance to reform.

1912
02:23:47,665 --> 02:23:50,485
Once upon a time, I used to think about
who I should kill when I come out of jail.

1913
02:23:51,752 --> 02:23:53,027
Those days are changed now.

1914
02:23:54,664 --> 02:23:57,553
I have my daughter to serve
me food when I come out

1915
02:23:58,058 --> 02:23:59,663
and my granddaughter, to play with.

1916
02:24:00,355 --> 02:24:01,835
There is a meaning for my life now.

1917
02:24:04,628 --> 02:24:05,777
He changed me, man.

1918
02:24:08,065 --> 02:24:09,807
He has changed me completely.

1919
02:24:10,559 --> 02:24:11,673
I got it.

1920
02:24:12,007 --> 02:24:14,250
I completely understood about him now.

1921
02:24:14,888 --> 02:24:17,490
Leave that to me now. I will take care.

1922
02:24:18,942 --> 02:24:19,767
Hmm...

1923
02:24:20,590 --> 02:24:21,622
Hey, bro...

1924
02:24:22,209 --> 02:24:24,377
I am the one who changed, not him.

1925
02:24:25,962 --> 02:24:27,585
He is the same hot-headed person.

1926
02:24:28,107 --> 02:24:29,921
If you utter the word background,

1927
02:24:30,170 --> 02:24:31,532
he would lose his mind. So be careful.

1928
02:24:31,732 --> 02:24:32,597
Argh!

1929
02:24:33,087 --> 02:24:34,321
Should you warn me several times, brother?

1930
02:24:34,574 --> 02:24:35,601
I've told you that I will
take care, haven't I?

1931
02:24:35,866 --> 02:24:37,402
-I'm Konda Reddy!
-We will see that.

1932
02:25:01,196 --> 02:25:03,771
It's been an hour.
Where is your CI sir?

1933
02:25:03,954 --> 02:25:04,647
He is coming.

1934
02:25:35,916 --> 02:25:37,723
Sir, I am Konda Reddy.

1935
02:25:39,447 --> 02:25:40,225
Hmm...

1936
02:25:40,857 --> 02:25:41,859
Are you that idiot?

1937
02:25:42,548 --> 02:25:44,509
-Yes.
-She is a little girl.

1938
02:25:44,849 --> 02:25:46,177
How can you set dogs on her?

1939
02:25:46,503 --> 02:25:48,154
-Don't you have any sense?
-Sir... Sir...

1940
02:25:48,353 --> 02:25:50,567
I have committed a mistake, sir.
That is why I am here to surrender.

1941
02:25:51,081 --> 02:25:51,573
Huh!

1942
02:25:52,042 --> 02:25:53,850
She hails from a small family
that makes a living out of toil.

1943
02:25:54,301 --> 02:25:55,897
How did you even think
they can afford her treatment?

1944
02:25:56,172 --> 02:25:57,376
It doesn't matter how much
the treatment would cost.

1945
02:25:57,607 --> 02:26:00,359
I will take her to the best doctor,
best hospital in the city.

1946
02:26:00,654 --> 02:26:03,912
I will pour my life into her.
[phone ringing]

1947
02:26:04,209 --> 02:26:05,045
Sir, one minute.

1948
02:26:06,857 --> 02:26:08,891
-Hello?
-I am MP Subba Reddy speaking.

1949
02:26:09,384 --> 02:26:11,939
Who is it...
who took you to the police station?

1950
02:26:12,397 --> 02:26:13,792
Didn't you tell him about our background?

1951
02:26:17,447 --> 02:26:18,577
Brother, I beg you.

1952
02:26:18,777 --> 02:26:20,609
I'm in the middle of something.
I will call you later. Hang up.

1953
02:26:21,856 --> 02:26:22,431
I hung up.

1954
02:26:22,486 --> 02:26:24,552
She will miss her school for 6 months.
What about her education?

1955
02:26:24,752 --> 02:26:25,645
I will take care, sir.

1956
02:26:25,823 --> 02:26:27,364
I will take care of her
education as long as she studies.

1957
02:26:27,539 --> 02:26:29,707
If she wants to become
a doctor or an engineer...

1958
02:26:29,774 --> 02:26:33,515
...or maybe both if she wants to.
[phone ringing]

1959
02:26:34,135 --> 02:26:36,517
-Who is this?
-I am MLA Venkat Reddy speaking.

1960
02:26:36,948 --> 02:26:38,159
Don't you even have my number with you?

1961
02:26:38,359 --> 02:26:41,382
I couldn't see because my eyes
are blurred. That's my situation.

1962
02:26:41,506 --> 02:26:45,353
Don't you worry! I am coming with
50 men to the police station.

1963
02:26:45,802 --> 02:26:47,840
Let us show who we are
and what our background is.

1964
02:26:48,040 --> 02:26:48,467
[gasps]

1965
02:26:53,068 --> 02:26:54,288
You don't need to show anything.

1966
02:26:54,364 --> 02:26:56,527
You take care of yours and
I will take care of mine. Hang up.

1967
02:26:58,503 --> 02:26:59,605
That was a real estate agent.

1968
02:26:59,800 --> 02:27:01,879
Whatever you said should
be in the written form.

1969
02:27:01,930 --> 02:27:03,437
-Sir...
-And that should bear your signature.

1970
02:27:03,637 --> 02:27:08,779
[phone ringing]
Oh no! The brother-in-law.

1971
02:27:09,834 --> 02:27:11,201
Get the bond papers ready

1972
02:27:11,401 --> 02:27:14,163
and call her parents too.
[phone ringing]

1973
02:27:14,279 --> 02:27:16,756
Put your phone in silent mode when you are
inside the police station. [phone ringing]

1974
02:27:20,296 --> 02:27:22,593
Tell me where should I sign.
I'll do it.

1975
02:27:22,793 --> 02:27:23,704
I should prepare it first.

1976
02:27:24,007 --> 02:27:26,860
Let me put my signatures first. You
can write whatever you want later.

1977
02:27:30,859 --> 02:27:31,836
-Brother-in-law!
-[gasps]

1978
02:27:32,581 --> 02:27:34,518
Why aren't you answering
my calls since long?

1979
02:27:34,804 --> 02:27:36,758
Who is that? Who the hell
has brought you here?

1980
02:27:36,858 --> 02:27:39,133
He should know our background!

1981
02:27:39,501 --> 02:27:41,756
-Hey, stop it, man!
-What now?

1982
02:27:41,923 --> 02:27:46,170
-Did he nab you knowing our background?
-No!

1983
02:27:55,964 --> 02:27:57,311
Who are you?
[gasps]

1984
02:27:58,191 --> 02:28:00,565
Hey, Konda Reddy, is it you?

1985
02:28:00,665 --> 02:28:01,138
Hmm...

1986
02:28:01,498 --> 02:28:02,822
I told you very clearly.

1987
02:28:03,054 --> 02:28:04,373
But how come you bounced back here?

1988
02:28:04,897 --> 02:28:06,875
-I did everything as you said, brother.
-Okay.

1989
02:28:06,958 --> 02:28:08,650
When everything was going smooth,

1990
02:28:09,154 --> 02:28:11,933
he arrived here like a telegram that
arrives into the first night room.

1991
02:28:13,046 --> 02:28:15,288
He uttered the absolute forbidden word.

1992
02:28:15,916 --> 02:28:18,898
All the compromises and
assurances were gone.

1993
02:28:19,720 --> 02:28:22,597
He reopened all the old cases
along with the dogs-case and

1994
02:28:23,606 --> 02:28:26,239
has beaten the hell out of me!

1995
02:28:26,672 --> 02:28:28,470
What is the actual case
that he filed to put you in?

1996
02:28:28,839 --> 02:28:30,140
I'll tell you, brother.
Give me a minute.

1997
02:28:39,914 --> 02:28:42,384
You got trapped by the nail
and I got trapped by the mango.

1998
02:28:45,514 --> 02:28:46,364
Come on.

1999
02:28:47,561 --> 02:28:48,748
[Krishna laughing]

2000
02:28:49,603 --> 02:28:50,441
A mango?

2001
02:28:50,932 --> 02:28:52,553
Well... will you drink tea?

2002
02:28:52,931 --> 02:28:53,720
Yes, brother.

2003
02:28:53,919 --> 02:28:54,849
-Yes, I will.
-We both will have it.

2004
02:28:55,954 --> 02:28:56,587
Hey, brother.

2005
02:29:05,638 --> 02:29:06,606
Three cups of tea.

2006
02:29:08,816 --> 02:29:10,546
Fifty! Fifty! Fifty! Fifty...

2007
02:29:10,801 --> 02:29:12,863
-Fifty rupees!
-Hey, what's with your squeezing?

2008
02:29:13,647 --> 02:29:15,951
You seem to be a bit odd?
Are you new here?

2009
02:29:16,073 --> 02:29:19,238
Yes, I came here by
getting transferred from Tihar jail.

2010
02:29:19,861 --> 02:29:21,062
What's with you?

2011
02:29:21,262 --> 02:29:24,602
Prisoners seek transfer to big jail
from smaller one for better facilities.

2012
02:29:24,698 --> 02:29:26,634
-Yeah!
-But why have you come here from there?

2013
02:29:26,877 --> 02:29:30,185
Tihar jail is highly secured. It's very
difficult to escape from that jail.

2014
02:29:30,641 --> 02:29:31,917
But here, it is easy.

2015
02:29:33,564 --> 02:29:36,471
What is it you plan to do so
urgently by escaping from here?

2016
02:29:37,061 --> 02:29:38,485
I have a guy to kill.

2017
02:29:38,708 --> 02:29:39,603
Who is he?

2018
02:29:40,223 --> 02:29:42,482
-CI Shankar.
-Ah?

2019
02:29:43,252 --> 02:29:45,304
[all laughing]

2020
02:29:45,397 --> 02:29:47,154
Pothu Raju Veera Shankar.

2021
02:29:47,330 --> 02:29:49,135
[all laughing]

2022
02:29:51,157 --> 02:29:51,847
Fifty!

2023
02:29:52,108 --> 02:29:56,908
[all laughing heartily]

2024
02:29:57,109 --> 02:29:59,213
We've been thinking
that we are the dumbest.

2025
02:29:59,835 --> 02:30:01,416
But this guy tops us!

2026
02:30:20,228 --> 02:30:21,027
<i>You got it, right?</i>

2027
02:30:21,272 --> 02:30:22,266
<i>This is it!</i>

2028
02:30:22,816 --> 02:30:24,757
<i>Our lives are can turn in any direction.</i>

2029
02:30:25,197 --> 02:30:27,908
<i>Anything can be changed and
any person can be reformed.</i>

2030
02:30:28,543 --> 02:30:30,995
<i>And that's why, let's stay happily.</i>

2031
02:30:31,579 --> 02:30:33,133
<i>Meet you later! See you!</i>
