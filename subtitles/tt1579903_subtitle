1
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,998
This is the border area where
the Indian home minister...

2
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,998
...is going to visit. We
should kill him even if...

3
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,998
...ten of our people
have to die for that.

4
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This is the order of Aslam.

5
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Go! Go away!

6
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Why are you looking
like that? Come on!

7
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,998
Scoundrel! How dare you
hold me by my hair?

8
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,998
Do you know who I am? I am
the wife of Aslam Khan...

9
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,998
...who is terrorizing your country.

10
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We caught you to make
him come out. Come on.

11
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,998
Hey! Go back. Nobody
should come forward.

12
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,998
Everyone go back. Mike!
Take care of them.

13
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,998
Will Aslam Khan come here?

14
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He will... - He will come and will
surely kill you all today.

15
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Aslam is here. Hey! Come on, fire!

16
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Oh my God! He is one of us.

17
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,999
This Aslam Khan is not
an ordinary man.

18
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He will destroy your country.

19
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Nothing has happened. Relax!
Have some water.

20
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,999
What did the military people do?

21
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,999
Nothing. - Did they beat you?
- They didn't do anything.

22
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Did they enjoy last night with you?

23
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,999
I did not give this to you as a
marriage gift. This is cyanide...

24
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,999
...which you should take if any
police or army people catch you.

25
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,999
But you did not die. Did you want
to see your husband's death?

26
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,999
No! No! - I have a wife
in every state in India.

27
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,999
I did this not to enjoy myself.

28
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,999
It is to provide shelter for my men.

29
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,999
I am giving you lakhs of rupees.
But still you betrayed me.

30
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,999
No, I did not betray you.

31
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,999
This money was found in your house.
I could have left you...

32
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,999
...in the hands of those military
people. But I did not do that.

33
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Because I am a man and not a duffer.

34
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Victory to Aslam Khan!
Victory to terrorism!

35
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Sir! The Governor is here.

36
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,999
Greetings, Aslam sir!
- Welcome, Governor sir!

37
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,999
Thank you. Come inside.

38
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,999
I am giving an lftaar party
in my house today.

39
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,999
Lftaar?! Did you come to invite
me even after knowing me?

40
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,999
I lost my prestige in our country.
The reason for that is...

41
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
...that Vijayendra Varma who
has insulted me in India.

42
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,999
I have to find and kill him. Then
only I will celebrate Ramzan.

43
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,999
He may not be alive.

44
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
He won't die.

45
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
He is alive to die in my hands.

46
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,999
Swami! We got married with your
blessings. See to it that...

47
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,999
...we don't get separated.
He went out last night.

48
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,999
But didn't return till now.
I don't know where he is now.

49
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Bring him home safely.

50
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,999
My dear daughter!
- I will not talk with you.

51
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,999
What mistake did I do?

52
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,999
Where did you go without informing
me? I cried a lot.

53
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,999
If something falls in your eyes,
my eyes will shed tears.

54
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,999
How can I see your tears?
That is why I went.

55
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,999
Here is your friend.

56
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,999
Idiot! Where did you go? How dare
you go without telling me?

57
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,999
Father! Where did you find it?

58
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,999
That eagle took it to
the sky mountain.

59
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,999
Did you climb such a
big mountain for me?

60
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,999
I will even bring the moon
if you ask, my baby.

61
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,999
You are my life and the
only wealth I have.

62
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,999
You should never leave me again.
- Ok.

63
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Promise?
- Promise.

64
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,999
Did you see that, Laxmi?

65
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,999
Our son-in-law loves his
daughter very much.

66
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,999
He has as much love
for his wife too.

67
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,999
We are fortunate to get such
a son-in-law. - That is true.

68
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,999
Stop your praises. You don't
understand how tense...

69
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
...I was since two days.

70
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,999
Why are you worried so much,
my child? He returned safely.

71
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,999
You don't understand my pain.

72
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,999
If he goes away for even a minute...

73
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,999
...I remember the past and
get scared about him.

74
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,999
You are unnecessarily
worried about him.

75
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Why are you remembering the
incident which he forgot?

76
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,999
Did you forget what happened
between us seven years back?

77
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,999
Why are you looking like that?

78
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,999
You cannot hide it
even if you try to.

79
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,999
Did you remember?

80
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
How can a person forget
his marriage anniversary?

81
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,999
According to our agreement I
should give you a bath today.

82
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,999
Come on.

83
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,999
No need. Champa!

84
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,999
I am coming, madam.

85
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
My God! Her gestures show
that she is very angry.

86
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,999
Now it is confirmed that she
is very angry with me.

87
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,999
You cannot enjoy your
anniversary now.

88
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,999
She is very angry.

89
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,999
I know how to handle her anger.
With a little magic...

90
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,999
...I can make her forget
her anger and come to me.

91
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What is that magic, sir?
- Love magic!

92
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,999
What is meant by love magic, madam?

93
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,999
Who told you about it?

94
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,999
Someone did. If you tell it me,
I shall teach my husband.

95
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,999
Then he will do that magic on me.

96
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,999
Everyone cannot do that magic.
Only my husband can do it.

97
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,999
But today I am not going
to let him do that.

98
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,999
But please tell me.

99
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,999
He massages my spine
with two fingers.

100
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,999
That creates a storm within me.

101
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You got it very well.

102
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
After that he slowly
moves his hands...

103
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
...from my shoulders and gives
me a jerk. Then the cyclone...

104
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,999
...becomes a typhoon. Then
he slowly put his hands...

105
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
...round my waist and hugs me.
Then starts the love magic.

106
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,999
'O God of love! I heard
you humming like a bee'

107
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,999
'This beautiful flower is waiting
to present you her honey'

108
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,999
'O flower! I shall taste
the honey of your beauty'

109
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
'A romantic night is
inviting us to enjoy'

110
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,999
'With the magic that you
did I forgot everything'

111
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
'I shall tie you with
the knots of happiness'

112
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,999
'Entice this honey bee with the
tinkle of your bangles and... '

113
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,999
'... with the smell of jasmines and
by taking it to your embrace'

114
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,999
'Let us enjoy in the moonlight... '

115
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
'... by fulfilling each others
desires in embrace'

116
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,999
'O tender flower! Let me make
you enjoy the divine pleasure'

117
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,999
'I am a parrot and you are
the king of romance'

118
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
'Let the river merge with the ocean'

119
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,999
'You stood like a support
for this creeper'

120
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,999
'I am very fortunate to
have a husband like you'

121
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
'Your beauty is exciting my heart'

122
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
'I cannot remain calm
after getting excited'

123
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,999
'I wait for you just as a
lotus waits for the moon'

124
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
'I shall not leave you and go away'

125
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
'Be the companion of this
creeper till the end'

126
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,999
Come on. Repeat what I say.

127
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,999
Mother! - Mother! - Cow!
- Cow! - House! - House!

128
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Take a look at this toy dog.

129
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Camel!
- Camel! - Ship! - Ship!

130
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,999
Control yourself! Let me check you.

131
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Doctor! I am not able to breathe.
I am suffering.

132
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,999
I don't understand what
he is saying in Punjabi.

133
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I pray to you. Please
save me, doctor.

134
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,999
What happened to you, sir?
The doctor will treat you.

135
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,999
You don't have to worry.
He is a nice doctor.

136
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,999
What happened to you?

137
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Last night I ate meals
at a road-side hotel.

138
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,999
He says that he ate meals
at a road-side hotel.

139
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,999
After that, he got stomach
ache and vomiting.

140
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,999
Indira! Give him these tablets
after ten minutes.

141
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Ok.

142
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,999
Father-in-law! - What is it? -
How did I understand Punjabi...

143
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
...which none of you
could understand?

144
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,999
There used to be a Punjabi
servant in our house.

145
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You learnt this language from him.
Now you remembered them.

146
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,999
My dear! Why are you sitting here
without coming for meals?

147
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,999
I am thinking about the things
which you are hiding from me.

148
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,999
I cannot convince myself that
what you said is true.

149
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,999
It seems that you are hiding
something about my past.

150
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,999
What is the need to
think about that?

151
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Shouldn't I know about myself?

152
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,999
What is there to know in this?
You are my husband...

153
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,999
...the father of our child and
the son-in-law of my parents.

154
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,999
You are the leader of these people.

155
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,999
If I grew up here, then why
don't I have any memories...

156
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,999
...about spending my childhood here?

157
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,999
When we are there to give our
lives for you, why do you...

158
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,999
...always want to think
about the past?

159
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Mother!

160
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,999
What is it, my dear?

161
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,999
I have my parents and
you have yours...

162
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,999
...but why doesn't dad
have his parents?

163
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,999
These people will not answer
this question and the God...

164
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
...will not say that to me.

165
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,999
What about you, grandma?

166
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I already ate. You have it.

167
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,999
We told you to vacate the
house one month back.

168
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,999
Don't you have any respect
for my words?

169
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,999
Where can I go with these two
children? My son will come...

170
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,999
...and repay your debt.

171
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,999
From where shall your son come?

172
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,999
Hey! Put both of them in the jeep.
Your debt will be cleared...

173
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,999
...if I send them to Dubai to
work as slaves for ten years.

174
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,999
They are small children.
What work can they do?

175
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,999
Who will repay the debt
if they don't work?

176
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Sir! Sir! What mistake
did I make, O God?

177
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
(The Arabian Sea, Gujarat)

178
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,999
How much salary would I get
in Dubai? Will the debt...

179
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,999
...my father took be cleared?

180
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,999
You will get 25 thousand if you
kill and one lakh if you die.

181
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,999
Whom and why should we kill?

182
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,999
You should kill Indians. If
you can't you shall die.

183
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,999
Why should we kill Indians? What
enmity do we have with them?

184
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,999
That is what terrorism is.
That is the noble war.

185
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,999
You are not going to Dubai. You
will be taken to the camp...

186
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,999
...of our terrorist leader
Aslam Khan in Pakistan.

187
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,999
I don't want this job.
I will go back.

188
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,999
I too.
- You did not tell us that...

189
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,999
...you are going to
make us terrorists.

190
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,999
No one told me that I have to
fight against my country.

191
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,999
I too was born in this
country as a Hindu.

192
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,999
I studied the epics Bharatha
and Ramayana.

193
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,999
When they told me that Hanuman
went to Lanka and...

194
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,999
...burnt it, I applauded. But
when a Hindu burnt my house...

195
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,999
...I could not applaud that.

196
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,999
That is why I joined
hands with Pakistan.

197
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,999
Do you want us to do the same?

198
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,999
How can we kill our own people?

199
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,999
Then die together. Brother!

200
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
How dare you rebel against
him? Come on.

201
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Don't harm them.

202
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,999
You will have the same fate
if you try to talk.

203
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,999
Everyone who has patriotism
is a burden to this country.

204
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,999
Why don't you learn driving?

205
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,999
How can I watch the wonders
of nature if I drive?

206
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,999
What are those wonders?

207
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,999
The curve at your waist when
you are driving and...

208
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,999
...your beauty which is
making me breathless.

209
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,999
How fortunate my eyes
are to see all this?

210
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,999
I will not drive if
you talk like this.

211
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,999
It is even better. What will
we do in the caravan?

212
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,999
Come on, let us play
love magic here.

213
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,999
Sit properly and close your eyes.

214
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,999
It is not possible for
me to stay calm.

215
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Please let me do something.

216
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,999
Thanks.

217
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,999
Remove your hand.

218
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,999
When you stopped the vehicle after...

219
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,999
...I said that I wanted
to do something...

220
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,999
...I thought that you gave
me the permission.

221
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,999
Nothing like that. See there.

222
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,999
Our master and madam
are here. Come on.

223
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,999
It is not enough if you
give money, madam.

224
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,999
Then?

225
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,999
You and your husband should come
and participate in the dance.

226
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,999
I don't have any objection.

227
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,999
Thank you, sir. Come on, madam.

228
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Both of you should come
and dance together.

229
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
'It started to rain on
the heights of Kailasa'

230
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
'The quarrelsome beauty
is getting excited'

231
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
'Catch hold of her hand'

232
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,999
'Start loving me in Mandapeta
and carry it...

233
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,999
...through to Madanapalli'

234
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
'Be my companion throughout'

235
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,999
'Hey man! Don't leave this girl'

236
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,999
'I shall come to you in
Palakollu and take up...

237
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
...the challenge in Palanadu.
I shall rob your beauty'

238
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
'O girl! This boy is getting
out of control'

239
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,999
'O young hen, O beautiful deer! '

240
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,999
'The heat of your nerves
is spreading to me'

241
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,999
'Shall we play the game
and settle the issue? '

242
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,999
'You are very rough but my
body is very sensitive'

243
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
'Let us see how you handle it'

244
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
'lf you excite me further... '

245
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,999
'... your nerves shall tingle'

246
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,999
'Start your attack on me... '

247
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,999
'... by drowning me with your kisses'

248
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,999
'Come on, let us start'

249
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
'I shall offer you my beauty'

250
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,999
'Don't go away from me after
trapping me with your beauty... '

251
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
'... and making me fall in love'

252
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,999
'Let us climb the
stairs to ecstasy...

253
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,999
...with the smell of these roses'

254
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,999
'I shall show you the
path take you there'

255
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,999
'lf you take me there,
there will be...

256
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,999
...a marks of love on your body'

257
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,999
'I shall get more and more excited'

258
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
'Don't let go off that place'

259
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
'Put a beauty spot there'

260
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,999
'Let me drink from the cup of
your beauty day and night'

261
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,999
'Don't delay any longer. I
gave you the green signal'

262
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,999
'See how we reach the
heights of joy...

263
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
...when we have a romantic fight'

264
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,999
Mother! Give me ten rupees.

265
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,999
What for?
- T o buy.

266
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,999
What do you want to buy?
- My father.

267
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,999
Don't talk nonsense.
Where is your father?

268
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,999
I mortgaged him. They will not
leave him until I pay them money.

269
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,999
How nicely he is extracting
the juice! He is a true man.

270
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,999
You are a man too. But what is the
use? You cannot do anything.

271
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,999
Why are you spitting?

272
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,999
My mouth is getting wet.

273
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,999
The juice is very tasty. It
is all because of love magic.

274
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
What is she saying?
What is love magic?

275
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,999
That is my magic. I
told her about it.

276
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,999
What is this? How dare you make
my husband do this work?

277
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,999
What should I do if he
does not pay the money?

278
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,999
What is this?

279
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,999
What can I do? Our child wanted
to drink the juice.

280
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,999
But you keep the money with
yourself. That is why...

281
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,999
...I mortgaged myself and
bought it for her.

282
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Since you buy such rot for her,
I keep the money with me.

283
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,999
Take this.

284
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,999
I don't want money, madam. Let the
sir extract some more juice.

285
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,999
I am ready.

286
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,999
Do you want to stay here? Come on.

287
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,999
Test your skill. Hit the balloons.
If you hit one...

288
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,999
...you will get another one for
free. If you can hit two...

289
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,999
...you will get the ring.
Come on, sir.

290
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,999
Father!
- What is it?

291
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,999
Father! Mother is not watching.
Hit the balloons.

292
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,999
I don't know how to hold the bow.
How can I hit the balloon?

293
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,999
You can do it, father. Try to hit.

294
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I will do it if you say.

295
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
How handsome he is!

296
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,999
Father, danger!

297
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,999
You are finished, sir.

298
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,999
I can handle it.

299
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,999
How is that?

300
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,999
By running away.

301
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Stop there!

302
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,999
Hey! Where can we find the deer?

303
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,999
Did you come for hunting?

304
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,999
Hey, Ram! We can think about
deer later.

305
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
First take a look at them.

306
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,999
How beautiful these
tribal ladies are!

307
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,999
It is a wonderful experience
to enjoy with them.

308
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:11,000
If you really have the desire, then
catch and bring four of them.

309
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I will shoot you all if
you try to come forward.

310
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Sir! They are taking away tribal
daughters. Please save them.

311
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
My dear!
- Please wait, my child.

312
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,998
Will you at least tell the truth
now? I don't know how to hold a bow.

313
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,998
How did I shoot the arrow?
When I don't know driving...

314
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,998
...how did I drive the jeep?

315
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,998
Listen to me...

316
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,998
Mr. Narayana Rao. Don't try to
repeat the same lie which...

317
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,998
...you are telling me since seven
years. I want the truth.

318
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,998
I want to know what happened.

319
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:57,000
If I had any relations, imagine how
much they might have suffered.

320
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,998
...whether I am dead or alive.
Fearing that I may leave you...

321
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,998
...don't separate my people
from me. Please!

322
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,998
Parents may lie to their children.

323
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,998
Children may also hide the
truth from the parents.

324
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,998
But no wife shall tell
a lie to her husband.

325
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I will tell you everything.

326
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Hey! Someone is here.
Call our people.

327
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Since my father is a doctor,
he immediately treated you.

328
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,998
I took care of you day and night.
Though you were out of danger...

329
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
...you could not remember
anything about your past.

330
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,998
My father who serves people
selflessly is my ideal.

331
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,998
Thinking that you may remember
your past if I move...

332
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,998
...closely with you I took one
decision. I made my parents agree...

333
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
...for our marriage. You
became one among us.

334
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:22,000
We came close to each other and
fell in love with each other.

335
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
We got married after that.

336
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,998
We tried to find out the details...

337
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,998
...about your past. But thinking that
the people who tried to kill you...

338
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,998
...may find you, we
dropped that idea.

339
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,998
I lived for seven years fearing
that something might happen to you.

340
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,998
Thinking that you might again
enter into that danger and...

341
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
...get separated from us, we
hid this secret from you.

342
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,998
Take a look at this. You will
understand how dangerous...

343
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
...your condition was
when I found you.

344
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,998
Bademiya tailors, Hyderabad.
I have to go to Hyderabad.

345
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,998
Is it necessary?

346
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,998
It would be a mistake
if I don't go there.

347
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,998
Had I committed any murder,
you would be accused...

348
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,998
...for sheltering me. If the
person who tried to kill me...

349
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,998
...is a criminal, then I am
responsible for making him so.

350
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,998
If we cannot decide whether the
punishment should be given...

351
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,998
...to them or to me, then I would
have done great injustice...

352
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,998
...to the process of law. You lived
with me for seven years.

353
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Decide what I should do now.

354
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,998
Who is there in Hyderabad, father?

355
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,998
I am going to find out that
only. I will come back.

356
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
You should come back soon. Promise?
- Promise!

357
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,998
Don't think that you are
going away from us.

358
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,998
You are going to find the
details about your people.

359
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Our relationship is not going
to end here. Return safely.

360
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
See you soon!
- Take care!

361
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,998
Instead of a hundred people
who do not have courage...

362
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,998
...a single man like me, who
dares to fight injustice...

363
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,998
...is necessary for this society.

364
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,998
Don't give unnecessary speeches.
Your luck is bad today.

365
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,998
It is written that you may
be beaten up unnecessarily.

366
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,998
Is that so? All these superstitions
work with you.

367
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,998
I am a king. If anything wrong
happens in front of me...

368
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,998
...then I will show you my capacity.

369
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,998
Excuse me!
- What do you want, sir?

370
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,998
There used to be a tailor
shop named Bademiya here.

371
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,998
There is no such shop here
as per to my knowledge.

372
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,998
Five years back all the
shops were removed and...

373
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:26,000
...this complex was built. That
shop too might have gone then.

374
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,998
My dear! Why are you looking at
me like that? Did you forget me?

375
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,998
I saw you for the first time.
I don't remember whether...

376
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
...I know you earlier or not.

377
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,998
You will not say it
even if you remember.

378
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,998
Don't you feel shy to tell that
you loved and betrayed me?

379
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,998
...the marriage hall? You think
that it affects your prestige.

380
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,998
Did I do that?

381
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,998
Yes. - Then come on, let
us go. - Where to?

382
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,998
I have to know all the details.

383
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,998
He is coming in the reverse
direction. If he comes to know that...

384
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,998
...we are just bluffing with
him, he will bash us.

385
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,998
Past is past. I will
rectify my mistake.

386
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,998
No need to create a scene in
public for that. Come on.

387
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,998
Stop there! Do you think we
are fools to let you go?

388
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,998
That is not going to happen. I
involve myself in every matter.

389
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,998
It is my habit to fight injustice.

390
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,998
By the way why did you do that?
Why did you run away?

391
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,998
I immediately want an answer.

392
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,998
Why are you staring at me? You
don't know about my power.

393
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,998
First tell me why you ran
away from the marriage.

394
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Why are you asking that question?

395
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
It is you who separated them.

396
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,998
Brother-in-law! He is the person
behind all your troubles.

397
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,998
Don't spare him.

398
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,998
Brother-in-law?!
- Yes. He ruined my sister's life...

399
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
...for the sake of his sister.

400
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,998
How dare you question me in
public after doing all this?

401
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,998
Let us pretend that
we are unconscious.

402
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,998
We will escape at the right time.

403
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,998
They could not bear the injustice
you did to them and...

404
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,998
...fell unconscious. Why
did you ruin her life?

405
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,998
Stop there. Don't make me
angry. You don't know...

406
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,998
...what I shall do if you hit me.

407
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,998
What will you do?

408
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,998
My God! I will fall at your feet.
Please don't hit me.

409
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,998
Go away.

410
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,998
Do you think I will leave
you if you fall at my feet?

411
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,998
I should know the truth. Carry him.

412
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,998
Sir! Both of them are
sleeping comfortably.

413
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,998
Is it necessary to
disturb them, sir?

414
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I will carry him, sir. All this
is my fate. Come on, get up.

415
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Come on, lift her up. Wonderful!

416
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,998
Where is the fridge?
- In the kitchen.

417
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,998
Tell me what you want.
I will bring it.

418
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,998
You will not come back
if I leave you.

419
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,998
Massage their feet so that their
bodies don't become cold.

420
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I shall go and bring some water.

421
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,000
On what did you step?
His shoes smell bad.

422
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Help! Help!

423
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,998
What did you do? Why did
she shout like that?

424
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,998
I did not do anything, sir. She
is the one who bashed me up...

425
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,998
...and shouted after that.

426
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,998
How can they beat you when
they are unconscious?

427
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,998
You will know the truth
if you look at them, sir.

428
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,998
Is this what you did here?

429
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,998
What happened here is not
what you are thinking, sir.

430
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,998
I swear by my mother.
Believe me, sir.

431
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,998
Sir! I have a doubt. If she
were really unconscious...

432
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,998
...how can she shout when
her zip was opened?

433
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,998
Are you questioning using logic?
If someone touches...

434
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,998
...a noble woman, in whatever
condition she may be...

435
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:12,998
...she will shout.

436
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,998
What can I say if you
think like that?

437
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:17,998
Shut up and make him
drink this water.

438
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Ok.

439
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,998
You ugly dog! Wipe my face.

440
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,998
I shall definitely wipe it off.

441
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,998
What did you say?

442
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,998
You hear whatever I say but
you don't see or hear them.

443
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,998
Because they are unconscious.

444
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,998
You always lie. I am going
to bring the milk.

445
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:37,998
Don't do wrong things.

446
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,998
Ok, sir. You don't have to worry.
These people are...

447
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,998
...taking care that everything
happens silently.

448
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Help! Help! Help!

449
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,998
Won't your attitude change even
after getting bashed up?

450
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,998
Even though she is unconscious
no crime was committed...

451
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
...because she was shouting.

452
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,998
Sir! She opened her eyes.

453
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,998
Are you joking? Are you
not ashamed of yourself?

454
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,998
This is how it is when one passes
through a bad phase, sir.

455
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,998
I am going to get a doctor. If
you misbehave with her again...

456
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:13,998
...I will kill you.

457
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,998
Sir! I pray to you. Please don't
go. I will go and bring him.

458
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,998
Do you want to escape
from me? You stay here.

459
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:20,998
I will go and bring the doctor.

460
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Ok.

461
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,998
My God! - We caught you. -
Instead of staying quiet...

462
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
...why did you interfere
in this matter?

463
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,998
My God! - Hello! When I said that
you are passing through bad times...

464
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
...you said that you don't
have such sentiments.

465
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,998
What happened now? It is all
written in your horoscope.

466
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,998
Shut up and get out, you idiot.

467
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,998
Come on, doctor.

468
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Where are they?

469
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,998
Did you see this, sir? They
bashed me up and went away.

470
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,998
Are you trying to play a new game?
Fearing that they may tell...

471
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,998
...the truth, you only might have
sent them away. Isn't it?

472
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,998
It is all my fate that you
don't trust me, sir.

473
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,998
I cannot tolerate this
pain anymore, sir.

474
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,998
Feed me two plates tandoori
biriyani, sir.

475
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I will get back my strength.
Then you can hit me.

476
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,998
Don't worry about the bill. You can
eat till your stomach is full.

477
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,998
It is enough if you tell
me about my past.

478
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,998
The figure is superb. That short
man seems to be her broker.

479
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,998
My dear! They are passing comments.

480
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,998
Anyone will pass comments if
you put up a show like this.

481
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,998
All this is my fate. If a husband
does not match his wife...

482
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,998
...then others think that
he is a mediator.

483
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,998
Listen carefully. You are
hearing only my voice.

484
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,998
You don't see anyone here except
me. All Indians are...

485
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,998
...your brothers except me.
Do you understand?

486
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:57,998
What about Dubai people?

487
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,998
Don't cross the borders. Every
man in this world except me...

488
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,998
...is your brother.
Do you understand?

489
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,998
What is the need to shout now?
Can I go and wash my hand...

490
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,998
...or will you lick it clean?

491
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,998
You need not reveal the truth here.
You go and wash your hand.

492
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Sir! Where is the wash basin?

493
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I too am going there. Follow me.

494
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,998
Hello! Are you taking her with you?

495
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,998
Yeah! - Don't you think that you
should inform her husband?

496
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,998
Why should I, sir?
- What if he feels bad?

497
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,998
Why should he feel bad? She will
wash her hand and return.

498
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,998
Hey! What did you say? How dare
you talk with me like this?

499
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,998
What is this? Why
are you beating me?

500
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,998
I will kill you.

501
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,998
Stop it. What happened?

502
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,998
He was trying to elope with my
wife in front of my very eyes.

503
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,998
Is it true?

504
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:48,998
When did you believe my words, sir?

505
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,998
It seems that he will kill me
if I stay here any longer.

506
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,998
He likes to ruin lives
of women, sir.

507
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,998
Do I? - Shut up! Fall at her
feet and seek forgiveness.

508
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,998
Ok. Where is the question of pain
when I am fully bashed up?

509
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,998
Please forgive me, madam. I
didn't know that the words...

510
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,998
...'follow me' have such a meaning.

511
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:07,998
You started again.

512
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,998
I told that today is a very bad
day for you. Did you now realize?

513
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,998
No need to wash your hand.
Just wipe it off.

514
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,998
You are neglecting me
because I am short.

515
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,998
You started to go with him as soon
as he asked you to follow him.

516
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,998
Is it because he is taller than me?

517
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,998
Why don't you listen?

518
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,998
What should I listen?
I lost my faith on you.

519
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,998
Now, you must prove that
you are a chaste woman.

520
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:25,998
How can I prove that?

521
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:26,998
You should jump into the
fire and come out safely.

522
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:27,998
Tomorrow...

523
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,998
My dear! What is this? Who is she?

524
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,998
I was wondering why you are
not coming home properly.

525
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:34,998
Is it because of her?

526
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,998
What an injustice, brother-in-law?
- Brother-in-law?!

527
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,998
What would happen to my sister
if you leave her like this...

528
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:40,998
...after marrying her?

529
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,998
I swear that I don't know
you. Please leave me.

530
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:43,998
My family life will be ruined.

531
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,998
Let it be. Don't we have our house?

532
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,998
You can keep her also if you want.

533
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,000
How dare you cheat me like
this, you short fellow!

534
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,998
I really don't know anything.
Please don't hit me. My God!

535
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,998
Should I jump into the fire
and come back safely?

536
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,998
How dare you doubt my chastity!
I will kill you today.

537
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:09,998
Stop it, madam. Stop it. The
reaction of a wife when she learns...

538
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,998
...that her husband does something
wrong is the concept...

539
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,998
...of our BTV program today.
You acted wonderfully.

540
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,998
Congratulations, madam.

541
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,998
But I was beaten badly.

542
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,998
Sir! Take a look at them. You shall
know that they are cheats.

543
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,998
This is a gift pack from
our BTV. Take it, sir.

544
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:27,998
Thank you.
- See you, sir.

545
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:28,998
You made her beat me and are
now giving a gift packet!

546
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Ok, bye!
- Bye!

547
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Hello! This is Bademiya,
the MD of BTV, speaking.

548
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,998
Good morning, sir.

549
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Rekha! Plan all the programs
perfectly. - Yes, sir.

550
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Is that you?

551
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:15,998
Who is he?

552
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
He is our MD Bademiya.

553
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,998
Please don't kill me. I betrayed
you for the sake of money.

554
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:31,998
Please don't kill me.

555
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,998
I did not come here to kill you.
I thought that I can learn...

556
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,998
...about my people if I meet you.

557
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,998
Are you not going to harm me?
Don't you know who you are?

558
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,998
I don't know.
- Don't you know who you are?

559
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,998
Please save me.
- I will save you.

560
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Please save me. Pull me up.

561
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,998
When did you come?
- When you were thinking about me.

562
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,998
How did you come here?

563
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,998
In the palanquin of your thoughts.

564
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:37,998
Why did you come here?

565
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,998
You kissed me in my
dreams last night.

566
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,998
I came here to give it back to you.

567
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:41,998
Then give it back.

568
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,998
Will you be satisfied
if I give it back?

569
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,998
Why should I fear when you
are there to satisfy me?

570
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,998
You shall forget about day and
night once I enter the field.

571
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,998
I know only how to start but not
to stop. Think and decide.

572
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I have already decided that you
are the boss of this body.

573
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:15,000
What happened? - My heart is
playing the music of romance.

574
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,000
What is the matter?
- My nerves are singing songs.

575
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,998
What happened now?
- The strings are breaking.

576
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
If you still delay,
it will be poison.

577
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:24,000
'I shall get friendly with
you and take you to heaven'

578
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
'I shall kiss you and make
you enjoy. Come to me'

579
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,998
'lf you come to me and
give me your beauty... '

580
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,998
'... then I shall show
you what I can do'

581
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,998
'O beauty! Don't get excited even
though your age pushes you'

582
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:51,000
'O my sweet dear! Let us indulge
in the fight of romance'

583
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:51,000
'Both of us are destined to
unite, O queen of gems'

584
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:01,998
'Love has sprung in the hearts of
both of us, O king of romance'

585
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,998
'I invite you to come to my lap'

586
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,998
'What do you think of yourself? '

587
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
'Come and hug me'

588
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,998
'My dear! The entire town
of Vuyyuru is agog with... '

589
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
'... discussion about your beauty'

590
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:22,000
'The whole town of Guntur is
talking about your manliness'

591
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,998
'lf you give me your hand I
shall become your companion'

592
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,998
'lf you hug me, I shall
fall in your lap'

593
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
'Give me your heart and come to me'

594
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,998
'I shall climb the horse
and come as the groom'

595
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,998
'I want to spend my
life in your company'

596
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
'Let us enjoy each others company'

597
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:25,998
Come on, tell me.

598
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,998
Run away quickly.

599
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,998
Hey! Come on, speak up.
Where is your son-in-law?

600
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:38,998
Your wife is not saying anything.
She shall not speak anymore.

601
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Laxmi! Laxmi!

602
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,998
Where is your son-in-law? You
will also die like your wife...

603
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,998
...if you don't speak.

604
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:49,998
He went away.

605
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,000
No. He will not run away.
My brother is a king.

606
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,998
He is the boss of the old city.
The person who killed him...

607
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:08,000
...cannot be an ordinary man. Tell
me where he is. Come on, tell me.

608
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,998
Is it him? Is he still alive?
Hey! Come here.

609
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Yes, boss!
- He is alive.

610
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,998
Didn't I tell you that he
is not an ordinary man?

611
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:34,998
Where did he go?

612
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,998
He went to Hyderabad. If he
sees you, he will kill you.

613
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,998
He is not an ordinary
man as you said.

614
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
I too am not an ordinary man.

615
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,998
Father! - Please run away!
- Hey! Catch them.

616
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Hey! Catch her. Hey! Stop there.

617
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Go and catch them.

618
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
My child!
- Mother! Mother!

619
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Aslam sir! Nanaji speaking.
Vijayendra Varma is alive.

620
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:30,000
O God! Many thanks to you.
My enemy is alive.

621
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Nanaji! I want him alive.
You should do this work.

622
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:46,998
Hey! He, his wife and his daughter
should be in this city.

623
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
You must go and get them.

624
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,998
Hello!
- Is this some new program?

625
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:54,998
You have played enough with me.

626
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,998
I want to talk to you. I am
not able to forget you.

627
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,998
Don't talk nonsense. I am married.
I have a daughter too.

628
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,998
Sir! How much time is there for
the Secunderabad bus to arrive?

629
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,998
It doesn't have a stop here.
That bus will go there.

630
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Hello! Listen to me.

631
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Madam! Madam!

632
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I am hungry. I am hungry.

633
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Give some idlies.

634
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:15,998
Make it fast.

635
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,998
Take it, sir.

636
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Eat this tiffin, madam.

637
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
???

638
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Should I eat the tiffin
you give? You sinner.

639
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,998
Many people have died
because of you.

640
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,998
Many families were dragged
on to the streets.

641
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:57,998
My son Nazir who believed you is
about to be hanged to death...

642
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:04,000
...in a day or two. See him die
and live happily. Go away.

643
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,998
You are praying to God regularly
since seven years.

644
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,998
But still you were sentenced to
death. I don't understand...

645
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,998
...the reason for your courage.

646
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:38,000
The faith that I have on
my brother is my courage.

647
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,998
He will risk even his
life to keep his word.

648
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:53,000
He will come. Wherever he may be,
but he will definitely come.

649
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,998
Greetings, sir.
- Whom do you want to meet?

650
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,998
Nazir. - Do you know who he is?
He is a hardcore terrorist.

651
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,998
The military is dealing his case.
If they come to know that...

652
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,998
...you came here to meet him,
they will shoot you. Go away.

653
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,998
No, sir. I have to talk with him.

654
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:18,998
Why do you want to talk with him?

655
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,998
What relation do you have with him?

656
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:21,998
I came here to find that out.

657
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,998
Don't you know how he
is related to you?

658
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,998
My God! Who are you?

659
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:26,998
He only can say that, sir.

660
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,998
Are you joking? Should
he tell who you are?

661
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,998
You don't know about this Timmappa.

662
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,998
I am a terror to the criminals
of Rayalaseema. Go away.

663
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,998
Please! I have to meet him. Please
try to understand me, sir.

664
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,000
He seems to be a mad fellow.
Throw him away.

665
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:49,998
How dare you do this to me?

666
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Shut up and show me where Nazir is.

667
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
No. Don't do that.

668
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
He is Nazir.

669
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Brother! My brother Vijayendra!

670
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
It's me, Nazir.

671
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,998
Brother Vijayendra!

672
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,998
Take him away.

673
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Brother Vijayendra!

674
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,998
Hello!
- Greetings, major sir!

675
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,998
Some person has come to see the
prisoner who got the death sentence.

676
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:24,998
We caught him when he attacked us.

677
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Definitely he might be a terrorist.
Bring him here.

678
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,998
Go and catch him.

679
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,998
O mother Kanaka Durga!
Please make me meet...

680
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,998
...my husband and my child.

681
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Jyoti, my child!
- My dear!

682
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
My dear! My dear! Jyoti!

683
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Mother! Mother!

684
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Mother! Please get up.
The train is coming.

685
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Are you a rowdy? What is your range?

686
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,998
Are you a street rowdy, city
rowdy or state rowdy?

687
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:29,998
You know that I use different
styles for different people.

688
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,998
T ell me in which way
I should proceed.

689
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,998
I am ready to fight you in any
type. I do not obstruct...

690
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,998
...anyone's path and I don't
allow anyone to block mine.

691
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:47,998
I have learnt to take on challenges
since childhood.

692
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:53,000
No one can beat me in a fight
or in a competition.

693
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Come on!

694
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Father! Father!

695
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Why are you crying? Don't
worry. I am here.

696
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,998
Jyoti!

697
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,998
Take care of the child. I think
she is still in shock.

698
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:13,000
She thinks that I am her father.

699
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,998
It is not enough that you give
birth to children. You should...

700
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,998
...also take proper care of them.
Don't leave her like this.

701
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Take the child carefully
to her father.

702
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Father!
- My dear!

703
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:57,500
You let him escape. How did you
get selected for this job?

704
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,998
Sir! He is the person.

705
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Stop the vehicles.

706
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Hey, mister! Stop there! Don't move.

707
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
(Seven years back)

708
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Down with terrorism!

709
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,998
Down with the government that
surrendered to terrorism!

710
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,998
If they don't release your fellow
terrorists, will you kill me?

711
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,998
They will definitely release them.
Because your father...

712
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:06,998
...is a central minister. They
must definitely release him.

713
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Down with terrorism!

714
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:15,998
Down with the government which
surrendered to terrorism!

715
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Don't release the terrorists!

716
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,998
My son died in the attempt
to catch these terrorists.

717
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,998
These merciless people destroyed
my entire family.

718
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Please don't release them.

719
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,998
Mr. Minister! Didn't you hear
the request of the people?

720
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,998
They doesn't want that terrorists
to be released.

721
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,998
They killed many people. Is it
proper to let them go free...

722
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,998
...for the sake of your son?

723
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,998
I don't feel sorry even if my
son dies. But such people...

724
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,998
...should not be released.
They must be hanged.

725
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:01,000
But this is the decision
taken by the government.

726
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:08,998
Don't shout like dogs. Your leaders
are afraid to keep us inside.

727
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,998
You have to salute terrorism.
You have no other choice.

728
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Men of this country
do not have guts.

729
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Come on, hurry up.

730
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Start!

731
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,998
Somebody is standing there.

732
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Keep on going.

733
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,998
Hey! What did you say?
Don't we have guts?

734
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:14,998
If our leaders let us free to do
what we want just for 24 hours...

735
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,998
...our army will be in your streets
and our flag shall be...

736
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,998
...dug into the throats
of terrorists.

737
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,998
The peace that we respect
is letting you live.

738
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:29,000
If we stop thinking
about peace, then...

739
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Drop the sword. Otherwise...

740
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,998
Indian army officer colonel
Vijayendra Varma has...

741
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,998
...successfully foiled the
attempts of Aslam Khan.

742
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Victory to Vijayendra Varma!

743
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Vijayendra Varma! You
killed just ten people.

744
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,998
It is the equivalent of my losing
just one hair from my beard.

745
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:34,998
You shall pay for this. I will
convert hundreds of citizens...

746
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,998
...of Hyderabad into terrorists.

747
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,998
Who is that Vijayendra Varma?

748
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,998
What did the government
say and what did he do?

749
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,998
What if something were
to happen to my son?

750
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:44,998
But nothing happened to him, sir.

751
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,998
Shut up! Your duty is only
to watch the borders.

752
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,998
You don't have a right
to question us.

753
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,998
You should aim the gun or drop
it with our permission.

754
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,998
Who gave these powers to a watchman?

755
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:05,000
I will not leave him. I will teach
him a lesson. Where is he?

756
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:21,998
Sir! Please stop!

757
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,998
Hey, mister! Stop there. Colonel
Vijayendra Varma on duty.

758
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,998
Look at this dirty style! Who asked
you to come to the airport?

759
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:30,998
Did the PM order you or
was it the President?

760
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,998
No one said that. He has
an itching for fame.

761
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,998
It is not I but it is you
who has that itching.

762
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,998
You feel itchy for power, the party
tickets and you feel itchy...

763
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,998
...for peoples votes
so that you can eat...

764
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,998
...like public money, like bandicoots.

765
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,998
If you speak unnecessarily I
will remove all your itches.

766
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,998
How dare you hit an MP?

767
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,998
I came here to hit you
but he interfered.

768
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,998
How dare you hit a minister
like me? You are finished.

769
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,998
Shut up! Your life depends
on the ballet box.

770
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:01,998
But I am in this position due
to my hard work and honesty.

771
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,998
You cannot do anything.

772
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,998
You talk too much. I
will see your end.

773
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,998
What can you do? You don't
know that I grew up...

774
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,998
...in the company of hunger and
not by being fed with love.

775
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,998
My education started not with
nursery rhymes but with...

776
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,998
...the struggle for a living.
I don't care for my life.

777
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,998
What can you do to me? Go
to the police station...

778
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,998
...and confess your mistake.

779
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,998
What are you talking? Are you
mad? What mistake did I do?

780
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,998
You made forty calls to those
terrorists in two days.

781
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,998
What relation do you have with
them? Are they your brothers?

782
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,998
It was you who told them
to kidnap your son.

783
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:45,998
You sold our national prestige
for 100 crores.

784
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:52,000
How dare you encourage terrorism
while we risk our lives...

785
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:57,000
...and cremate your body
at the borders.

786
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:03,000
What is this outrage?
What did my father do?

787
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,998
All the mistakes which your
father did will be revealed...

788
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:19,000
...in just a few minutes.
You shall see that.

789
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,998
Come on, run. Within five minutes
from now you should go...

790
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,998
...to the nearest police station,
get the FIR written...

791
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,998
...and make a phone call. Your son's
body will explode if you delay.

792
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,998
Please don't harm my son.

793
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,998
I will give you as much
money as you want.

794
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,998
I am not a politician to change
colors by taking money.

795
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,998
I am not a corrupt officer take
share in the scams you do.

796
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,998
I am from the Indian army. I will
kill you without a second thought.

797
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,998
Run quickly. Five seconds
have already passed.

798
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Don't harm my son. I shall
confess my crime.

799
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,998
Greetings, sir! What
happened to you?

800
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
FIR!

801
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Hello! Hello!

802
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,998
The minister is dead, sir.

803
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Sir! The minister died out of shock.

804
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,000
That's all.

805
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,998
Stop it! Stop the train! Why are
you starting the train before...

806
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,998
...everyone got in. Hold on.
You idiotic driver!

807
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Is this something funny? Why don't
you stop? Stop the train.

808
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,998
What do you think? Am
I a girl or a doll?

809
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:58,998
Why did you hold so tightly?
See this for yourself.

810
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:04,998
What should I say if my family
members ask about this?

811
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,998
Why are you looking at me as
if you don't know anything?

812
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Do you know how respectful
my family is?

813
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,998
I am the granddaughter of Mr.
Peddi Raju of Sakinetipalli.

814
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,998
I am the daughter of Mr.
Padmanabha Raju.

815
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,998
I am the niece of Mr. Madhi Raju.

816
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,998
You don't know about my
family's greatness.

817
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,998
If my family members come to know
that you did this to me...

818
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,998
...they will kill you.
Do you know that?

819
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Cover it! I was not talking
about your mouth.

820
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,998
What happened?
- It happened again.

821
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,000
A dent!
- Where?

822
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,998
On the front side.

823
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:01,998
How many of them are they in all?

824
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:06,998
Two in the front, two in the back
and one in the middle. Five in all.

825
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,998
Ok, I will put them in my account.

826
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,998
Go quietly where you have to.

827
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:11,998
How should I go to this address?

828
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,998
I am coming immediately.
Don't go anywhere.

829
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Alas! My address slip!
My address slip!

830
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,998
Good morning, sir! I am Ram
Nayak, Circle Inspector.

831
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,998
Glad to meet you. One of the
terrorists who died the other day...

832
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,998
...is from Hyderabad. Find out
the details about his family.

833
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,998
Ok, sir.

834
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,998
Grandma! Mother!

835
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,998
What is it?
- What happened?

836
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:36,998
It seems that uncle
will be shown on TV.

837
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,998
Is that so?
- Is it true, Bharati?

838
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,998
Yes, mother. Where is dad?

839
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:42,998
Where is he? Nazir!

840
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:48,998
Hello! I am here. I heard the
sound. Where is the bottle?

841
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,998
You always think about drinking.

842
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Our Vijayendra is going
to appear on TV.

843
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Twirl your mustache. It is big
enough to hold a liquor bottle.

844
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,998
Guarding the country is my duty.
I didn't come here...

845
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,998
...to get felicitated for that.
I came here to tell you about...

846
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,998
...those people because of
whom I am in this position.

847
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,998
All the people of that colony
who gave shelter...

848
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:23,000
...to this orphan are my parents.

849
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,998
My uncle Narayana purchased me...

850
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:30,998
...a slate and chalk and
sent me to school.

851
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,998
When my teacher slapped
me, my uncle Yadav...

852
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:37,998
...went to the teacher and
had a verbal duel with him.

853
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:43,000
My Satyam uncle sold his
ring to buy books for me.

854
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,998
How can I repay their gratitude?
When it was I...

855
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,998
...who made the mistake my brother
Nazir took the blame...

856
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,998
...and the blows too. My
sister-in-law Razia used to wait...

857
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,998
...anxiously for my return from
school. And there is a goddess...

858
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:02,998
...among all these people there.
She is my mother.

859
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,998
She used to love me more
than her own children.

860
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:11,000
She is a mother to
the entire colony.

861
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:21,998
If we compare what he did for us,
what we did for him is meager.

862
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,998
Uncle!

863
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Hey! How are you? Very good.

864
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,998
Get me down!

865
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Bring him down. Don't
make him breathless.

866
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,998
You must be very tired. Come
on, let us go inside.

867
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,000
What about me?

868
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Nothing doing! Why
did she come here?

869
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,998
Your son intentionally
made me come here.

870
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,998
He intentionally threw my address
slip. When I asked him...

871
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,998
...what should I do now, he brought
me here saying that...

872
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,998
...I can stay here until
I find that address.

873
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:03,998
Who are you?

874
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,998
She is the grand daughter of Mr.
Peddi Raju of Sakinetipalli.

875
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,998
She is the daughter of Mr.
Padmanabha Raju and...

876
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,998
...the niece of Mr. Madhi Raju.
Her name is Venkata Laxmi.

877
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:12,998
What is this?

878
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,998
My God! I too started
speaking like her.

879
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,998
I understood everything.
You come inside.

880
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,998
Can I address you as
my brother-in-law?

881
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,998
Definitely! You don't
have to hesitate.

882
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,998
I swear by this liquor bottle.

883
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,998
Why don't you put a color TV
in my room, brother-in-law?

884
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,998
Color TV?! I never thought that
being addressed as brother-in-law...

885
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,998
...is so costly. You can address me
as you want. But I cannot do that.

886
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,998
How many quarters of liquor should
I lose to buy a color TV?

887
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,998
Think once again about my prestige.

888
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,998
Sister! You send meals and
other things here only.

889
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,998
I don't have to habit of getting
down from the bed.

890
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,998
Ok. - Is it enough? Or should
we feed you with our hands?

891
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,998
Shut your mouth and get down
from the bed. What did...

892
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,998
Why are you fighting with that
girl? Is she an ordinary girl?

893
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,998
She is the grand daughter of Mr.
Peddi Raju of Sakinetipalli.

894
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,998
She is the daughter of Mr.
Padmanabha Raju and...

895
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,998
...the niece of Mr. Madhi Raju.
Her name is Venkata Laxmi.

896
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,998
Mother! Please stop. Did
she affect you too?

897
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,998
Great people's history is
remembered like that.

898
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Don't try to act smart.

899
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,998
Hey! You are talking too much.
It will start a war.

900
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,998
If you give me my address slip
I will leave immediately.

901
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,998
She started it again!
Let me find that slip.

902
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,998
After that I will kick
you in such a way...

903
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,000
...that you shall land
at Sakinetipalli.

904
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,998
Come on, speak up. Since
how many years...

905
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,998
...is your son working
as a terrorist?

906
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:38,998
I don't know, sir. He finished
medicine and went to work in Dubai.

907
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,998
Don't make up stories. All of you
have a relationship with militants.

908
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,998
You are living in this country
but are working for Pakistan.

909
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,998
No, sir. Please don't say that.
I too am a freedom fighter.

910
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,998
When Pakistan was separated,
then I proudly said...

911
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,998
...that I will stay in this country.

912
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,998
I swear by the noble Koran.

913
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:00,998
I really don't know anything.

914
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,998
You will not tell the truth
like this. I will...

915
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,998
Ram Nayak! They don't know
anything. Let them go.

916
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:06,998
Why are you saying that, sir?

917
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:12,998
They are true Muslims. They don't
lie after swearing by the Koran.

918
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Sir! Come on, let us go.

919
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,998
It seems that the police have given
a lot of pain to Kalishaw.

920
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,998
Since he is from military, he would
not have spared even women.

921
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:43,000
How prestigiously they
lived till now!

922
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Greetings, Kalishaw sir.
- Greetings!

923
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,998
Who are you?
- I am Aslam Khan.

924
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:56,998
I came here from Pakistan.
I am a terrorist leader.

925
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:01,998
Your son Sharif was trained
as a Jihadi at my camp.

926
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,998
He gave his life for the noble war.

927
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:06,998
It is your good fortune...

928
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,998
...that such a son has
born in this family.

929
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,998
We are dying with shame
that he is our son.

930
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,998
Because of you our religion
has acquired a bad name.

931
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,998
Every Muslim is being considered
as a terrorist.

932
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,998
It is in our country that every
religion is respected.

933
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Stop it!

934
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,998
I am tolerating all your foul talk...

935
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,998
...because of your son's sacrifice.

936
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:32,000
His death brought you fortune also.

937
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,998
Take these 10 lakhs.

938
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,998
Who wants your money?
I don't want a money...

939
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,998
...which came from the
death of a mean person.

940
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,998
Get out of my house, you dirty dog!

941
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Take it, my child.

942
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,998
Anwar! Are you mad? This is
not money. It is poison.

943
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:54,998
Are you eating food or grass?

944
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:59,998
Yes. I ate grass all these days.
From today I will follow the path...

945
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,998
...which my brother showed to me.
I shall work for Aslam sir.

946
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:10,998
Not only a Hindu, every person who
comes in the way of your goal...

947
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:16,998
...is your enemy. It may be your
parents, siblings, wife or children.

948
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,998
You will become a true Jihadi
only if you remove them...

949
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,000
...from your way. Come on.

950
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,998
Are you trying to trap our
child with these designs?

951
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,998
Nothing like that. I did this
because he is feeding me.

952
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,998
Then all the houses in this
colony belong to him.

953
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:40,998
All of us have raised him.
He is a son to all of us.

954
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:47,000
You should decorate the front
yards of all the houses.

955
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,998
Hey, Munna! What have you
done to my design? You...

956
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:56,000
I shall teach you a lesson.

957
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,998
Stop there.

958
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Are you hiding here?

959
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:05,998
Who is that?

960
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Is that you? Did I hit
hard? No problem.

961
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,998
You delete one from your account.

962
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:17,998
Delete from the account?! How dare
you talk with me like this?

963
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Hey, stop there.

964
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,998
My God! What have you done?
You have spoiled...

965
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,998
...my family prestige. I shall
inform my family members...

966
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,998
...and file a case against you.

967
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:34,998
If you file a case against me,
my prestige will be spoiled.

968
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,998
Forget this incident. I will get
a dozen blouses stitched for you.

969
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,998
Is it ok? This incident should
not be known to anyone else.

970
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Remember that. Ok?

971
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,998
That girl is very lucky
to get a man like you.

972
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:55,998
In one go you got a dozen
blouses stitched for her.

973
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,998
Don't you know me? I am just
donating her some clothes.

974
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,998
Is it? Days changed so much
that blouses and petticoats...

975
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,998
...are being donated instead
of saris and shawls.

976
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,998
Is it a hi-tech development?

977
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,998
We should not keep thinking
about the things we donate.

978
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,998
I forgot everything. You
also forget it. - Ok.

979
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,998
Clothes became very costly.
They are not giving...

980
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:14,998
...any discount even
to military persons.

981
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,998
You will get a discount
if you purchase a dozen.

982
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,998
Why didn't you try that?

983
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,998
Dozen?! I tried that way too.

984
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:22,998
Didn't you get any discount
even after that?

985
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,998
Lives are tearing off like clothes.

986
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:28,998
Don't use such words, uncle. Bye!

987
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,998
Listen! I packed the parcel
for you. One dozen dosas.

988
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,998
Dozen blouses?!
- I said dosas not blouses.

989
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Slip of tongue, aunty. Bye!

990
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Six plus six is
- Twelve. - That means a dozen.

991
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,998
This house is becoming very
dirty. I am cleaning it...

992
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,998
...at least a dozen times everyday.

993
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,998
Everyone is talking about a dozen
today. Did the matter leak?

994
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,998
The intoxication which we get
from a quarter of liquor...

995
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,998
...cannot be obtained even after
drinking a dozen beers.

996
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:02,998
Isn't it, brother?
What happened to you all?

997
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,998
Everyone
is speaking sarcastically.

998
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,998
Don't try speaking indirectly.
I will tear you all.

999
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,998
We know that you are an
expert in tearing things.

1000
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,998
Why are you making fun of him?

1001
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,998
That girl is our guest.

1002
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,998
Since he has a good heart, he
brought her a dozen blouses...

1003
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,998
...when she was crying that
her blouse was torn.

1004
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,998
Isn't it, my child?

1005
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,998
I understood now. Hey, dent!

1006
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:29,998
Yes. - Didn't I tell you that
no one else should know this?

1007
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,998
Even I too said the same
thing to everyone.

1008
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:35,998
Members of our family
always keep their word.

1009
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:39,998
Shut up! Pack your luggage. If
I see you again in this house...

1010
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,998
...I will tear you off.

1011
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,998
I am not an ordinary girl
who you can tear off.

1012
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:51,998
If you give my address slip,
I will leave immediately.

1013
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,998
Venkata Laxmi! Come and have
the meals. - I don't want.

1014
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,998
I took three quarters of liquor
since I was hurt that you are upset.

1015
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,998
I cannot take more. Please come
for the dinner, sister-in-law.

1016
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,998
Don't call me like that. Go
and tell your brother that...

1017
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,998
...I shall leave if he gives
me my address slip.

1018
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,998
Venkata Laxmi!

1019
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Are these documents yours?

1020
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,998
When the address is in letter,
why are you staying here...

1021
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,998
...saying that you lost
the address slip?

1022
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,998
Why are you staying here
leaving so much property?

1023
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,998
Come on, tell me.
- What can she say, mother-in-law?

1024
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,998
I think she is in love
with my brother-in-law.

1025
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,998
Is that so?

1026
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,998
What about this property?

1027
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,998
Though I am from a royal family,
I don't have anyone.

1028
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,998
I too am an orphan. I don't
want the property earned by...

1029
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,998
...someone else. Is that
property more valuable...

1030
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:42,998
...than your son?

1031
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,998
That's true. When the brandy
shop is at home...

1032
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,998
...who wants to go
for country liquor?

1033
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:50,998
You always think about
liquor. Vijayendra!

1034
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,998
I am coming, mother.

1035
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,998
Both of you will get married
on the coming Friday.

1036
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,998
I like this girl.

1037
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:04,000
It is ok for me if it is ok for
you. - Don't you like her?

1038
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:37,998
'This girl is very sweet and
wants a kiss every hour'

1039
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:43,998
'This boy is very handsome and
wants to kiss me always'

1040
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:49,000
'Sweet thoughts are inviting
us, come with me'

1041
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,998
'Let your lips meet mine'

1042
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,998
'We must start off immediately'

1043
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,998
'He is seeking this tender flower'

1044
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,998
'He wants to melt in its warm lap'

1045
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:11,000
'Once more! Once more! '

1046
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,998
'The girl transformed into
butter in the moonlight'

1047
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:03,000
'My eyes are filled with
the beauty of her youth'

1048
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,998
'This youth is not diminished
due to the acts of your love'

1049
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,998
'It gets even more enhanced
in the shower of your love'

1050
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,998
'Don't entice me and go
away and don't stop me'

1051
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,998
'Your youth is boiling over'

1052
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,998
'My youth shall look splendid
when draped in a sari'

1053
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,998
'I shall consent if
you become the sari'

1054
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,998
'I shall rule your kingdom
as its king'

1055
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,998
'Shall I sprinkle the magic
of my love on you? '

1056
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:34,000
'Once more! Once more! '

1057
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,998
'Decorate yourself with lilies...

1058
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:26,000
...which I shall bring for
you in a golden pot'

1059
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,998
'lf you touch this raw fruit
it shall become ripe'

1060
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,998
'The party starts when
you embrace me'

1061
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,998
'I am ready to be with
you all through...

1062
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,998
...the night till you are satisfied'

1063
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,998
'Your love is very strong'

1064
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,998
'I am getting mad over you'

1065
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,000
'You are praising my love... '

1066
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,000
'Once more! Once more! '

1067
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:19,000
My God! What have you done, father?
All my family members died.

1068
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Down with Vijayendra Varma!
Down with Vijayendra Varma!

1069
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,998
All of you will die if you
try to attack our child.

1070
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:38,998
Stop there! They have come to talk
to me. You should not interfere.

1071
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Go inside and close the doors.

1072
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,998
My family members died
because of you.

1073
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:51,998
They could not bear the insult you
did to them and committed suicide.

1074
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,998
No need to talk with him.
Let us take revenge on him.

1075
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,998
Let us see who is powerful,
A Muslim or a Hindu.

1076
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,998
You are angry that your
people are dead.

1077
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,998
But don't try to turn it into
a religious conflict.

1078
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:02,998
Don't shed the blood
of innocent people.

1079
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:06,998
If you think that I am the culprit,
you can punish me.

1080
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,998
He bowed because he is guilty.
What are you looking at?

1081
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Beat him.

1082
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:29,998
Stop it!

1083
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,998
Fatima!

1084
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:32,998
The person whom you raised...

1085
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,998
...was responsible for the
death of these people.

1086
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,998
We are expelling you from the
religion so long as you let him...

1087
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,998
...stay in your house.

1088
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Come on.

1089
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
My son!

1090
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:54,998
What is this? When they were
hitting you with stones...

1091
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,998
...why didn't you answer them?
Why did you take blame...

1092
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:03,000
...for a crime that
you did not commit?

1093
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:10,998
For the sake of this mother who is
giving shelter to all religions.

1094
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,998
Who can bear to see the tears
shed by this mother...

1095
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,998
...when her children kill each
other in the name of religion?

1096
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:21,998
What does it matter if I shed a few
drops of blood to stop a bloodbath?

1097
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,998
I thought of removing you from my
way by using a religious conflict.

1098
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,998
But you destroyed my plans
with your blood.

1099
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:28,998
I shall not spare you.

1100
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:33,998
They expelled us from the religion.
We cannot go to the...

1101
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,998
...mosque and pray. All this
happened because of you.

1102
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:42,998
What are you talking, my dear?
- Shut up!

1103
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,998
I am not speaking in a drunken
state. I am speaking...

1104
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:46,998
...from the intoxication that
I got due to his words.

1105
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:51,998
Brother Nazir! Are you
criticizing Vijayendra?

1106
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,998
This is my family problem. It
shall be decided immediately...

1107
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,998
...whether he or I stays
in this house.

1108
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,998
Don't say such big words.
I will leave this house.

1109
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,998
Why are you still standing? Get out!

1110
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:06,998
I don't want any caste or
religion. I want him.

1111
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:12,998
Get out! You don't have a place
in this house from now.

1112
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Get out, you scoundrel! Get out!

1113
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,998
Where can we find honesty
in this country?

1114
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,998
When the person whom we
gave food and shelter...

1115
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:31,000
...wants to kill us, where
can we find protection?

1116
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:35,998
I don't have anyone. I will take
revenge on this country...

1117
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,998
...which gave me such pain. If I
am expelled from this country...

1118
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:44,000
...I shall go and even
beg in Pakistan.

1119
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Who are you?

1120
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,998
You make so many idols of Gods.
Which God has come...

1121
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,998
...to your rescue when your own
son was separated from you?

1122
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,998
Who among these can stop me from
killing your adopted son?

1123
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:25,998
Don't think of fighting with him.
It is not good for you.

1124
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Is he such a great man?

1125
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Grandma! Grandma!

1126
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:35,998
Please don't harm my grandma.

1127
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,998
Don't salute him. What can he do
to me when these Gods are here?

1128
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,998
You go home, Bharati.

1129
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Bharati?!

1130
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:51,998
You are a Muslim but named your
granddaughter as Bharati.

1131
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Well done!

1132
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Bharati! This old lady has
a lot of patriotism.

1133
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:09,000
If you don't want her to die
then take off your clothes.

1134
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:18,998
I shall see you become naked here.
Otherwise I will kill this old lady.

1135
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:22,998
I will do as you said. Please
don't kill my grandma.

1136
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,998
No, Bharati! Don't do that.

1137
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Come on.

1138
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Come on.

1139
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Open your eyes.

1140
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
My child!

1141
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Take this.

1142
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,998
You are trying
to strip off...

1143
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,998
...the clothes of
your mother and not Bharati.

1144
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,998
Your mother delivered and raised
you here in this country.

1145
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:39,000
How dare you try to stifle
the throat of such mother?

1146
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,998
If we wish so, you will
not get any land to stay.

1147
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:50,998
You are living on our mercy. Your
life will end if we get angry.

1148
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:51,998
What do you have to
feel proud about?

1149
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,998
What can you do to our 100
crores of population?

1150
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:58,998
You can just play dramas with the
help of traitors like this scoundrel.

1151
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:02,998
Come on, speak up! If you
don't speak, I swear by...

1152
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:06,998
...my motherland, I will kill
you now itself. Speak up!

1153
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:10,998
I will tell the truth.
- Come on.

1154
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,998
For the sake of money I joined
hands with Aslam and...

1155
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,998
...killed all my family members
with my own hands.

1156
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,000
It is I who hanged them all.

1157
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Bash that mad dog up.

1158
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,998
Why are you sitting
like that, my child?

1159
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Nothing.

1160
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,998
Then why are you crying?

1161
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Is it because your husband
is not here?

1162
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:18,998
Control yourself.

1163
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:24,998
Don't I have that pain? It is not
good to cry on an auspicious day...

1164
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:29,998
...like this. That is why
I am hiding my tears.

1165
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,998
I had a lot of dreams
that both of you...

1166
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,998
...together will perform
his marriage.

1167
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,998
It will happen as
you wanted, mother.

1168
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:39,998
Shall he come here?

1169
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:44,998
He will come, mother. All that
happened is a part of my plan.

1170
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,998
I sent him to find out the
terrorists who are in the old city.

1171
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,998
It is because of my brother that
the truth about Anwar was known.

1172
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,998
Your brother is a drunkard. What
if the terrorists know the truth?

1173
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:56,998
Nothing will happen to my
brother when I am here.

1174
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:57,998
I will risk my life to save him.

1175
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,998
Uncle!
- What is it? - Where is your son?

1176
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,998
He doesn't know anything.

1177
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:03,998
What happened now?

1178
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:08,998
Why doesn't he come to ask
me whether I ate my food...

1179
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:13,998
...and whether I liked the
clothes and jewelry etc?

1180
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,998
He is a military person. He
doesn't know such things.

1181
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:19,998
A person may become the prime
minister of a country.

1182
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:20,998
But he still remains a
husband to his wife.

1183
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,998
Let the marriage be over. I shall
spin him around my finger.

1184
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:26,998
Stop that. My head is
already spinning a lot.

1185
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,998
Uncle! Why are you all still
here? Up to a thousand...

1186
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,998
...of my friends from the military
are coming for the marriage...

1187
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:32,998
...by the New Delhi express.

1188
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:34,998
Make arrangements for them.

1189
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:38,998
We shall take care of all those
things. You don't worry.

1190
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:42,998
Your behavior is crossing the
limits. I am coming. Go inside.

1191
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:47,000
I shall deal with you separately.

1192
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:25,998
'This shy girl has bloomed
like a flower'

1193
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:29,998
'He is like a blazing
fire who wants my love'

1194
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:33,998
'The beautiful swan
eventually consented'

1195
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:37,998
'O my handsome man! Come
and make me yours'

1196
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:41,998
'The sound of her anklets
is mesmerizing my heart'

1197
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:47,000
'The smell of jasmines
is titillating me'

1198
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:36,998
'The music of her love is
echoing in the mountains'

1199
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:40,998
'Kiss me at the auspicious hour'

1200
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:44,998
'My finger wants to
play with your navel'

1201
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,998
'I love your energetic moves'

1202
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,998
'lf you come to me quickly I shall
start my work immediately'

1203
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:58,000
'lf you call me with love
I shall come to you soon'

1204
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,998
'Her looks are sharp
and are piercing me'

1205
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,998
'I am thrilled with his pinches'

1206
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:07,998
'O pretty girl! I already
invited you'

1207
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,998
'Shall I come to you myself
and offer you my wealth? '

1208
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:15,998
'Shall I shower you with the
raindrops from the cloud'

1209
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,998
'I am very thirsty and shall drink
from the cup of your love'

1210
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:23,998
'lf you come to my embrace
my desires will increase'

1211
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:27,998
'Don't I understand how much you
love me from your gestures? '

1212
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:31,998
'I like the naughty things she does'

1213
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:37,000
'I get dimples on my cheek
when I think of him'

1214
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,998
If I am to regain my
lost prestige then...

1215
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,998
...I have to kill him and throw
him on the streets of Lahore.

1216
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:40,998
But it is not that easy. He
is not an ordinary person.

1217
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,998
He made the people, who threw
stones at him, sing his praise.

1218
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,998
This happened because
he came to know that...

1219
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,998
...I killed my own people.
- How did he know that?

1220
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,998
I shall tell you. Nazir is
responsible for all this.

1221
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,998
Nazir?! - The quarrel he had
with those in his home and...

1222
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,998
...his joining your ranks, is all
a drama conducted by Vijayendra.

1223
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:01,998
Not only that. A thousand military
men shall attend his marriage.

1224
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:03,998
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1225
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:07,998
I got an opportunity to pierce
the heart of India with my flag.

1226
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:11,998
If a thousand military men are
killed at once, the people...

1227
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:15,998
...of India shall hang their
heads in shame and die.

1228
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:19,998
I understood it. As soon as the
train crosses Bilaspur station...

1229
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:23,998
...I shall sieze control of the
engine. And I shall blow up...

1230
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:27,998
...the bridge which is
forty kilometers away...

1231
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,998
...from that place, with explosives.

1232
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:34,998
I shall cut the throats of that
Vijayendra who maligned me...

1233
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:40,000
...and of his supporters
who laughed at me.

1234
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,998
You scoundrel!

1235
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:47,998
How dare you deceive
us by becoming...

1236
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:53,998
...one amongst us! I stood like a
dog in the streets because of you.

1237
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,998
It is the faith which I reposed
in him, that he destroyed.

1238
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:01,998
Leave him to me. I shall punish
him for his betrayal.

1239
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Come on!

1240
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:17,000
I am a person who killed my own
parents. You are nothing to me.

1241
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:51,998
If a thousand military men are
killed at once, the people...

1242
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:58,000
...of India shall hang their
heads in shame and die.

1243
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Victory to India!

1244
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,998
You look like a king, my child! I
had a wish to see you get married.

1245
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:27,000
My wish is being fulfilled
after a long time.

1246
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:29,998
Hello!
- Brother!

1247
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:31,998
Aslam Khan is planning to
kill the military men...

1248
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,998
...who are about to attend your
marriage, by blowing up...

1249
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,998
...their train when it
passes over the bridge.

1250
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:42,000
You must go soon to save
those military men.

1251
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Finish it quickly.

1252
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:48,998
What is all this? See the time.
You can perform this dance...

1253
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,998
...in the marriage tomorrow.
Come on, go to your beds.

1254
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,998
What about you? What is happening?
Sorry boys!

1255
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:57,000
You too should sleep now.

1256
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:19,000
You all go away from here. Quickly!

1257
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,998
Come here, you bastards! I am
the princess of Sakkinatipalli.

1258
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:28,000
I shall die only after killing you.

1259
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:07,000
The train shall not
stop anywhere. Go on.

1260
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Stop the train.

1261
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Didn't I tell you not
to stop the train?

1262
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:55,998
The brake is broken. The
train cannot stop.

1263
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:59,000
That is what we want.

1264
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:47,998
Aslam Khan did not spare
even kids and old people.

1265
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:53,998
He killed everyone. The marriage
hall turned into...

1266
02:13:54,000 --> 02:14:00,000
...a graveyard with the dead
bodies and cries of death.

1267
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:33,998
Bademiya passed the blame
for all this to Nazir.

1268
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:37,998
He is the one that is responsible
for this carnage.

1269
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:39,998
He is a big terrorist.

1270
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:41,998
Hey Bademiya!

1271
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,998
He accused him of joining
hands with the terrorists and...

1272
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,998
...killing many people and ensured
that he gets the death sentence.

1273
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:48,998
Grave injustice has been
meted out to Nazir

1274
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:49,998
In which jail is brother now?

1275
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,998
He was beaten very badly in the
jail yesterday over some trouble.

1276
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:56,000
He is in the hospital now.

1277
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:24,998
Brother! Why do you cry? Is
it because I lost my hand?

1278
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,998
You could save the lives
of many military men.

1279
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:33,998
This loss is very insignificant
for that achievement.

1280
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,998
Sir! There is a call from the
home ministry at the center.

1281
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:43,000
They have annulled the death
sentence given to Nazir.

1282
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:50,998
The faith he reposed
in you has succeeded.

1283
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:54,998
I am a sinful woman who
misunderstood you.

1284
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,998
Don't say such things, mother. It
is my duty to save my brother.

1285
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,998
There is one more duty that
you shall have to do.

1286
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:04,998
Nanaji abducted many other children
along with our own ones...

1287
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:08,998
...saying that we did not repay
his debt. No one knows...

1288
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,998
...what he did to them
or where he kept them.

1289
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,998
You must get them freed
and wipe the tears...

1290
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:16,998
...of the parents of those children.

1291
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:21,998
Ok mother. I know where he sent
them. It is my duty to free them.

1292
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Father!

1293
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:29,998
Doctor! Please save my child.

1294
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:31,998
She fell ill due to her
pining for her father.

1295
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:37,000
She may not live unless
her father returns.

1296
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Doctor! Doctor!

1297
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
My dear!

1298
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Come and save the child.

1299
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:50,998
Whose child is she?

1300
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:51,998
She is my child.

1301
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,998
She fell ill due to her pining for
her father. She is not taking...

1302
02:16:55,000 --> 02:17:00,998
...even food and water. She
is not taking any medicine.

1303
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:02,998
But how can I save her?

1304
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:06,998
She thinks that you are her father.

1305
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:08,998
Please have a kind heart...

1306
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:13,998
...and act as if you are her father.
My daughter shall live. Please!

1307
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,998
Father!

1308
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Father!

1309
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:22,000
My child! I am your father!

1310
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:29,998
Father! Have you returned? Will
you never go away again?

1311
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:31,998
No my child. I shall not
go away. See how mother...

1312
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:33,998
...is crying for you.

1313
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:37,998
But mother told me that you forgot
us. Is it true, father?

1314
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:41,998
Mother always tell lies. You are my
dear child. How can I forget you?

1315
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Please take this tablet
and drink this milk.

1316
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:53,998
I want to sleep in your lap, father.

1317
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:55,998
Why my lap? You can sleep
on my heart, my child!

1318
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:59,000
You always reside there.

1319
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:17,998
You came at the right time
to save your daughter.

1320
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:23,998
My daughter! No, doctor. She
thinks that I am her father.

1321
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:28,998
I acted like that so
as to save her life.

1322
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:32,000
I shall take your leave.

1323
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:19,998
We enquired thoroughly, sir. Nanaji
kidnapped about fifty children.

1324
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:23,998
Make a phone call to the Central
Defense Secretary.

1325
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Hello!
- This is me, Aslam Khan.

1326
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:33,998
Are you surprised as to how
I got your phone number?

1327
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:37,998
Your communication secrets
are no match...

1328
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:42,998
...to my intelligence network. You
shall come to Pakistan and die here.

1329
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,998
You shall have to come here for
the sake of your wife and child.

1330
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Aslam! It is not for
my wife and child.

1331
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:52,998
...all those children whom you
kidnapped to make them terrorists.

1332
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:57,998
It is my duty wipe the tears of
the parents of those children.

1333
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,998
I shall come there. I shall come
to kill you and bring you...

1334
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,998
...back here and ensure that
they get their revenge.

1335
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:09,000
Hey! Bring the children
in that cell, here.

1336
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:48,000
Hunger! Hunger!

1337
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:54,998
Hunger! It is hunger that
makes anyone do anything.

1338
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:59,998
Decide whether you shall die of hunger
for the sake of your patriotism...

1339
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:04,998
...or agree to become terrorists.
Vijayendra Varma is coming here...

1340
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:09,998
...to free you and uphold the
honor of your country.

1341
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,998
He must understand that you
have become my people.

1342
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:16,998
There is your national flag.
Shoot it to shreds...

1343
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,998
...and make him hang
his head in shame.

1344
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Vandemataram!

1345
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:01,000
Hey! Bring that flag here.

1346
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,998
Nanaji! Stamp it.

1347
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:19,000
Stamp it in such a way that the
patriotism in their heads goes away.

1348
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,998
Victory to Bharat!

1349
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:33,000
Throw her away.

1350
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:40,000
Victory to Bharat!

1351
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:17,000
Victory to Bharat!

1352
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:24,000
Who is that?

1353
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:36,000
Victory to Bharat!

1354
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:43,998
You proved that you are the
child of a military man.

1355
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,998
You are smaller than my finger!
Why do you have...

1356
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:51,000
...so much patriotism in your head?

1357
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:07,000
Stamp the flag with your feet
before his very eyes.

1358
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:18,998
You are very headstrong. You
defamed me and put me...

1359
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:22,998
...to shame in my own country.
I shall cut off your head and...

1360
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:26,998
...show it to my countrymen. I have
to regain my lost prestige.

1361
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:28,998
That is why I made you come
here. This is my country.

1362
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:30,998
Your men are not present here.

1363
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,998
Hey! I always had faith in
the strength of my heart...

1364
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,998
...but never depended on
the support of others.

1365
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:38,998
My courage is my strength.
But what do you have here...

1366
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:40,998
...for which I have to take
the support of others?

1367
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,998
You have some idiots in every
street and together all of you...

1368
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:45,998
...are a terrorist organization
with a name.

1369
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:47,998
Besides that what strength
do you have here?

1370
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:51,998
Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Ahmed,
Al-Qaeeda etc...

1371
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,998
What is there in these? If I
start killing each of you...

1372
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,998
...you shall all be finished in
half-an-hour. There is no need...

1373
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,998
...to resort to a war to eliminate
you. A single courageous man...

1374
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,998
...from our military
is what it takes...

1375
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:07,998
You know only that. Here even our
leaders live with our permission.

1376
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:09,998
They must do as we say.
They must always stay...

1377
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:11,998
...in the corners of our eyes.

1378
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,998
Shut up, you bastard! It is the
same leaders who are shaking hands...

1379
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:16,998
...with our country and
are seeking peace.

1380
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:20,998
The people of your country are
looking forward to our friendship.

1381
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:22,998
From now on no one shall pay
heed to mad dogs like you.

1382
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:26,998
That is why you are trying
to stifle this friendship.

1383
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:30,998
That is not as easy as you think.
Because I am there to protect it.

1384
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:34,998
I shall cut you to pieces.
Army! Indian Army!

1385
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:36,998
I shall kill you people
without a second thought.

1386
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:38,998
Vijayendra! You are dreaming.

1387
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,998
If both the countries
desire to shake hands...

1388
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:45,998
...we terrorists are there to cut
the hands off. This terrorism...

1389
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,998
...is ready to strangle the
throats that ask for peace.

1390
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,998
You don't have the strength
to protect any of them.

1391
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
Hey!

1392
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,998
This is enough. The power
of this fist is sufficient.

1393
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,998
If this hand, which knows to treat
good people with respect...

1394
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:07,998
...becomes angry then the lines in
this palm shall become swords...

1395
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:13,000
...to cut your throats
and erase your fates.

1396
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:44,000
Victory to Bharat!

1397
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:59,998
'The sky tore apart and
rained thunderbolts'

1398
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:04,998
'The wind changed its form
and became an inferno'

1399
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:10,998
'The sea overcame its barriers
with a surge of power'

1400
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:14,000
'The volcano freed its arms'

1401
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,998
'It decided to vanquish evil'

1402
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:23,998
'The power of God itself took
this form to achieve this'

1403
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:28,998
'It took the form of the
enraged Lord Narasimha'

1404
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:34,000
'It slashed the throats
of the terrorists'

1405
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:47,000
'Your eyes are like blazing suns'

1406
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:52,998
'Your looks are like the
Lingas of Lord Shiva'

1407
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:57,000
'Your fingers generate electricity'

1408
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:03,000
'They are not fingers
but powerful weapons'

1409
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:10,998
'Your steps create tremors in
the hearts of the wicked'

1410
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:15,000
'Roar like the patriot Bhagat Singh'

1411
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:26,000
'Move ahead and destroy the evil
forces and their machines'

1412
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,998
'The strength of a hundred crore
fists has come to you'

1413
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,998
'You heart is filled with the
strength of a hundred crore hearts'

1414
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:46,000
'From Kashmir to Kanyakumari...

1415
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:53,000
...every heart reverberates
with the sound...

1416
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,998
...that is omnipresent...

1417
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,998
...the sound 'Vandemataram'

1418
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:05,000
'You became the fire that
the song represents'

1419
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:10,998
'And tore the heart of the
white men to shreds'

1420
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:17,000
'You were the Alluri who was filled
with pure Telugu blood'

1421
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:27,000
'Your blood became the Indian Ocean'

1422
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:32,998
'Your breath transformed
into a great tempest'

1423
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:36,998
'You got enraged like
an injured tiger...

1424
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:42,000
...picked up your weapons
and destroyed the enemy...

1425
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:46,000
...with a violent power'

1426
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:57,998
'You became Subhash Chandra
Bose and formed...

...an army with the strength
of the desire for freedom'

1428
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,998
'You wielded the sword to
decimate evil forces'

'With the power of the bow, the
sword, and like the wheel of Dharma...

1430
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:26,000
...you became the battle cry and
the flag in the march to victory'

1431
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:31,998
You personified the blazing
fire and took the form of...

1432
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:37,000
...the God Kalki wielding
a sword to destroy evil'

1433
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Come on. Hurry up.

1434
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:26,000
C'mon, fast.

1435
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:30,000
Move. Hurry up!

1436
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:17,000
Move. Hurry up!

1437
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:19,998
Fast!

1438
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
Jump!

1439
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:46,998
Close the door, sir.
It may be dangerous.

1440
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,998
Our duty is to play with danger.

1441
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:51,998
Take off the plane. - Sir...

1442
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:55,000
It's an order!

1443
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:02,998
Forgive me! - Aslam Khan. This is
not a hand, this is a death trap.

1444
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:06,998
Help me. - This is the paw,
which is used to fight for freedom.

1445
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,998
Tomorrow my country will
see the rise of victory!

1446
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,998
Call for help.

1447
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:16,000
No one will help you here.

1448
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:20,998
This is the lesson for
the traitors and the militants.

1449
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:27,000
They will give up the fight,
when they see your dead body.

1450
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:23,000
O Almighty!

1451
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,998
Dear, are you alright?

1452
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
No!

1453
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:42,000
Grandmother.

1454
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:49,000
C'mon, dear.

1455
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
Success!

1456
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:54,998
Grand success!

1457
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,998
Greetings.
Welcome to Maa TV news channel.

1458
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,998
The hero of today's headlines
is colonel Vijayendra Varma.

1459
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:04,998
He has rescued our
Indians from the terrorists...

1460
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:08,998
...risking his life. Not only that...

1461
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,998
...he has wiped out
terrorism from the country.

1462
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,998
He is the brave
hero of the country.

1463
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:18,998
The government has honored
him with the 'Mahavir Chakra'.

1464
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,998
And given him the promotion.

1465
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,998
Is it paining? - Nothing.

1466
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:31,000
What he did was right. His blow
made me get my memory back.

1467
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:02,998
How do you know about this?

1468
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:04,998
I can't act like you.

1469
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:06,998
Act?

1470
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,998
Yes. You have forgotten
me and now you act...

1471
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,998
...that your memory has come back.

1472
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:16,998
We are like dreams of the night.

1473
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:20,000
She is your true lover.

1474
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:24,998
She is the goddess,
who sacrificed her life for you.

1475
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:30,000
It is not right to forget her.
Take this bouquet.

1476
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,998
One has made a sacrifice
and you have given me my life.

1477
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:41,000
It is my good fortune that
God has sent you as my wife.

1478
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:47,000
You are the women
with all supreme qualities.

1479
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:52,998
There can be
no sacrifice without a woman.

1480
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:54,998
Woman is the greatest
in this whole creation.

1481
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:59,998
We pray to the motherland,
The Goddess of Earth.

1482
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:04,998
This is my fortune
to have a wife like you.

1483
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:08,000
I am really fortunate.

1484
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,998
What is this? Where are we?

1485
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,998
Father. Mother,
what are you doing there?

1486
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:36,000
C'mon let's go from here.
Come to our land.
