00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,760
Hina, can you get them
started on the visa process?

4
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:10,763
Of course.

5
00:02:11,462 --> 00:02:13,699
Line one. It's Dr. Hassan.

6
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:16,632
Dr. Hassan, don't tell
me you've been arrested

7
00:02:16,634 --> 00:02:18,935
for possession again.

8
00:02:18,937 --> 00:02:20,137
I understand that,

9
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:22,905
but just because you didn't
intend to turn it into opium

10
00:02:22,907 --> 00:02:25,512
doesn't mean that importing
poppy from Pakistan looks good.

00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,394
I think I can help you.

15
00:04:57,396 --> 00:04:59,766
Okay, awesome.

16
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,602
But there is one thing.

17
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:07,040
I'm not in a position
to pay you in dollars.

18
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,473
Go on.

19
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:13,879
Do you take other forms
of payment?

20
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,747

23
00:05:41,906 --> 00:05:44,710
Uh, no, but they, uh, they
had some other mangoes, Mom.

24
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:47,013
They looked real good.

25
00:06:00,057 --> 00:06:03,762
I don't know, a Desi

Visa issues.

28
00:06:13,738 --> 00:06:15,805
Well, you could go back, Mom.

29
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,110
Or at least, I don't
know, leave the house?

30
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:26,918
It was good.

31
00:06:29,754 --> 00:06:31,490
Epileptisical...?

32
00:06:31,956 --> 00:06:33,725
Yeah, I did.

33
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:36,729
I did that, I ran a few miles.

34
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:40,766
I, uh, worked out
with the weights.

35
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:42,634
I did a lot of crunches.

36
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:07,492
I'd prefer to be out.

37
00:07:42,093 --> 00:07:46,466
Maybe that should be
enough for today, Mom.

38
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:48,668
Why don't we do something
else? Let's go for a walk.

39
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,272
Mom, your knees are
just going to get worse

40
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,475
if you don't use them.

41
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:57,776
That's how it works.

42
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,056
This is so dumb.

43
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:13,957
You know this is dumb, right?

44
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,760
This, this doesn't happen
in real life.

45
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,861
People don't randomly
get saved by strangers.

46
00:08:18,863 --> 00:08:21,000
And they definitely don't
fall in love at first sight.

47
00:08:28,673 --> 00:08:29,674
He's dead.

48
00:08:33,912 --> 00:08:34,747

Hey, so what can I get you?

60
00:09:35,874 --> 00:09:38,842
Oh, can I get a whiskey soda,
but in two separate glasses.

61
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,910
And a wedge of lime.

62
00:09:40,912 --> 00:09:42,646
We don't have a wedge of lime.

63
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,781
Okay, no lime, but a straw.

64
00:09:45,783 --> 00:09:46,619
Okay.

65
00:09:50,254 --> 00:09:51,356
Nice stack.

66
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,126
Thanks.

67
00:09:55,092 --> 00:09:56,094
Uh, you too.

Are you a writer?

73
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,026
Oh, gosh no, I'm a lawyer.

74
00:10:29,126 --> 00:10:30,259
Oh.

75
00:10:30,261 --> 00:10:31,960
Are you a writer?

76
00:10:31,962 --> 00:10:34,229
Uh, no. I own a bookstore.

77
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:37,135
Hmm, and you like
to eat beavers.

78
00:10:41,005 --> 00:10:41,841
I do.

79
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,109

the counselor here

80

of favorites.

82

Where were you last night?

135
00:21:17,607 --> 00:21:18,274
Yeah for real,

136
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:18,974
I didn't even hear from you.

137
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,375
Out with a couple of friends.

138
00:21:20,377 --> 00:21:21,346

00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:46,305
[All Men] Ooh.

142
00:21:51,075 --> 00:21:52,741
Menudo?

00:21:52,743 --> 00:21:54,779
(laughing)

144
00:22:25,643 --> 00:22:27,476
Who is that?

145
00:22:27,478 --> 00:22:30,712
That's, um,
we'll talk about it later.

146
00:22:30,714 --> 00:22:32,914
Mm-hmm, she's cute.

147
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,685
You better watch out.

148
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,187
Save your strength.

149
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:39,521
Watch your feet.

you're going.

151

152
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,594
Drop!

153
00:22:45,596 --> 00:22:46,565
And pop.

154
00:22:46,963 --> 00:22:47,798
Here we go.

(yelling)

156
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:57,476
Ahh.

157
00:23:00,944 --> 00:23:02,748
Where are you today?

158
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:05,680
Don't get me wrong,

159
00:23:05,682 --> 00:23:07,783
I like this whole lion
spirit animal thing.

160
00:23:07,785 --> 00:23:09,788
But you seem distracted.

161
00:23:16,894 --> 00:23:18,630
I had a long night.

162
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:21,896
Who is she?

163
00:23:21,898 --> 00:23:22,733
Shh.

164
00:23:25,736 --> 00:23:27,769
I don't know why
you date women.

165
00:23:27,771 --> 00:23:30,506
I don't know why you date men.

166
00:23:30,508 --> 00:23:32,740
With men,
I have no expectations.

167
00:23:32,742 --> 00:23:34,809
I just assume they'll
be emotionally stunted.

168
00:23:34,811 --> 00:23:37,748
Women are so emotionally
available.

169
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,819
It's a lot of work.

170
00:23:42,686 --> 00:23:44,889
I have a hearty work ethic.

171
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,790
Be straight with me.

172
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:51,160
How many women have you
been with?

173
00:23:51,162 --> 00:23:52,764
Define been with.

174
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:57,869
Sexed, dated, loved.

175
00:24:00,938 --> 00:24:02,941
Sexed, four?

176
00:24:04,741 --> 00:24:07,546
Dated, two...

177
00:24:07,811 --> 00:24:08,546
Ish.

178
00:24:09,713 --> 00:24:12,716
Loved...

179
00:24:12,983 --> 00:24:13,884
Zero.

180
00:24:25,229 --> 00:24:26,761
Ow.

181
00:24:26,763 --> 00:24:27,930
Get over it.

182
00:24:27,932 --> 00:24:29,664
[Zaynab] Thanks again.

183
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:32,601
Oh, and you, um, you have
my ID, so give me a call?

184
00:24:32,603 --> 00:24:33,872
Oh, this is Zaynab.

185
00:24:34,805 --> 00:24:35,837
She's cute.

186
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:38,239
In a Dr. Zhivago kind of way.

187
00:24:38,241 --> 00:24:40,244
You gonna call her back?

188
00:24:41,178 --> 00:24:42,644
Maybe.

189
00:24:42,646 --> 00:24:43,813
Maybe.

190
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,681
Wow, so does that mean you're
going to see her again?

191
00:24:46,683 --> 00:24:47,918
I don't know.

192
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,225
Ooh.

193
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:04,866
How'd you find me?

194
00:25:04,868 --> 00:25:08,272
Uh, the bartender.

195
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:14,776
I asked how I could find
that girl from last night.

196
00:25:14,778 --> 00:25:15,614
You.

197
00:25:17,013 --> 00:25:17,848
Her.

198
00:25:19,983 --> 00:25:21,019
She.

199
00:25:25,722 --> 00:25:27,558
Pronouns are so weird.

200
00:25:29,727 --> 00:25:31,026
What's my name?

201
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:32,029
Hmm, what?

202
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:35,901
You don't remember my name,
do you?

203
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:38,269
Give me five to choose from.

204
00:25:39,703 --> 00:25:41,972
Jennifer, Marielle,

205
00:25:42,906 --> 00:25:44,942
Carolina, Jackie, Cruz.

206
00:25:46,376 --> 00:25:48,611
Could you repeat the choices?

207
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:49,812
It's Alma.

208
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:50,815
Alma, yes!

209
00:25:53,017 --> 00:25:54,248
Did I do that?

210
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,818
Uh, no, it's my coach.

211
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,886
It was an accident.

212
00:25:58,888 --> 00:26:01,023
Thought you were a lawyer.

213
00:26:01,025 --> 00:26:02,658
I am a lawyer.

214
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,192
One of my clients is
this former pro wrestler,

215
00:26:04,194 --> 00:26:05,995
she's my coach.

216
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:09,968
No, like, like,
we have an arrangement.

217
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:13,369
Jolt, yeah, that's her
former pro wrestler name.

218
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,907
Got the belt and everything.

219
00:26:19,876 --> 00:26:21,278
Uh, Luna Peligrosa.

220
00:26:23,013 --> 00:26:24,615
Luchadora Mexicana.

221
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:28,917
Is that your wrestling coach?

222
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:32,357
'Cause you've got some
pretty good moves.

223
00:26:34,325 --> 00:26:36,659
I came out of her.

224
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,763
I don't know that move.

225
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,634
No. That's my mom.

226
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:07,092
They're gay?

227
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:15,767
They're real gay.

228
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,141
Not a potential.

229
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,466
Remember, if you freak
out, I'll get hurt.

230
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:53,071
And I don't want to get hurt.

231
00:27:55,271 --> 00:27:56,106
Ah.

232
00:27:57,107 --> 00:27:59,344
(grunting)

233
00:28:04,815 --> 00:28:05,884
(groaning)

234
00:28:25,903 --> 00:28:27,835
What's my signature move?

235
00:28:27,837 --> 00:28:29,103
How do I get one?

236
00:28:29,105 --> 00:28:32,007
Mm, you don't need
a signature move.

237
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:34,109
Besides, the right one
can take years to develop.

238
00:28:34,111 --> 00:28:34,942
Oh.

239
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:37,011
It's got to come
from your soul.

240
00:28:37,013 --> 00:28:37,448
Ah.

241
00:28:39,215 --> 00:28:40,250
You're so good.

242
00:28:41,218 --> 00:28:42,821
Why'd you retire?

243
00:28:43,854 --> 00:28:47,122
Well, wrestlers never
really retire.

244
00:28:47,124 --> 00:28:49,056
In fact, I'm supposed to
compete again in a few weeks,

245
00:28:49,058 --> 00:28:50,558
but my knee's killing me.

246
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,395
Huh.

247
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:54,296
And I don't have
the right outfit.

248
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:55,266
Oh.

249
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:00,371
(claps)

250
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:04,041
Oh. (claps weakly)

251
00:29:10,247 --> 00:29:12,247
Okay, Mom, it's either
an instant message,

252
00:29:12,249 --> 00:29:13,347
or an email, it's not both.

253
00:29:13,349 --> 00:29:14,182
Hm.

254
00:29:14,184 --> 00:29:15,249
So, what did it, uh,

255
00:29:15,251 --> 00:29:16,086
What'd it say?

256
00:29:24,361 --> 00:29:25,463
Okay, so what should we do?

257
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:04,568
(gasping)

258
00:30:07,171 --> 00:30:08,006
Ah!

259
00:30:12,242 --> 00:30:13,211
Mm, gracias.

260
00:30:15,546 --> 00:30:17,312
Thank you, gracias.

261
00:30:17,314 --> 00:30:18,149
Spicy.

262
00:30:20,483 --> 00:30:23,053
So that one's chicken,
and this one's steak.

263
00:30:23,921 --> 00:30:24,518
There's no pork, right?

264
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,187
I don't eat pork.

265
00:30:25,189 --> 00:30:26,054
Me neither.

266
00:30:26,056 --> 00:30:26,654
You don't?

267
00:30:26,656 --> 00:30:28,259
Nope, I'm half Jewish.

268
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:29,658
Which half?

269
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,226
That's for me to know,
and for you to find out.

270
00:30:31,228 --> 00:30:34,595
So, how did your
whole family get here?

271
00:30:34,597 --> 00:30:38,970
Well, my mom traveled a
lot with the luchadoras.

272
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:41,068
She stopped wrestling
when I was born.

273
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,036
She wanted to go back to school,

274
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:43,271
but my dad didn't want her to,

275
00:30:43,273 --> 00:30:46,173
so she left him after
my brother was born,

276
00:30:46,175 --> 00:30:48,176
and then we came here.

277
00:30:48,178 --> 00:30:49,210
Hm.

278
00:30:49,212 --> 00:30:50,211
How about you?

279
00:30:50,213 --> 00:30:52,247
How'd you end up here?

280
00:30:52,249 --> 00:30:54,315
They came for the same
reasons as your family.

281
00:30:54,317 --> 00:30:56,186
Money, jobs, opportunity.

282
00:30:57,387 --> 00:30:59,054
What's funny is, my
mom, back in Pakistan,

283
00:30:59,056 --> 00:31:01,189
used to be way more moderate.

284
00:31:01,191 --> 00:31:03,225
And then she moved here, and
she became more conservative.

285
00:31:03,227 --> 00:31:04,660
Like, more Muslim, even?

286
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:07,296
I would've loved
to have met her then.

287
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:08,463
You don't talk
to her about it?

288
00:31:08,465 --> 00:31:10,934
Mothers and daughters
aren't friends in our culture.

289
00:31:11,468 --> 00:31:12,903
Well, not in my family.

290
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,703
We love each other, we
care for each other,

291
00:31:15,705 --> 00:31:18,407
but even wanting to be friends,

292
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:22,313
my mom would say, Zaynab,
that's a very American concept.

293
00:31:23,513 --> 00:31:24,982
Zaynab...

294
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:26,551
Does that mean anything?

295
00:31:28,218 --> 00:31:32,257
Precious flower, or one
who glorifies her father.

296
00:31:33,123 --> 00:31:34,392
[Alma] Wow, how's that going?

297
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:38,262
My father died a
little over a year ago.

298
00:31:38,996 --> 00:31:40,398
Oh god, I'm sorry.

299
00:31:41,565 --> 00:31:44,298
Yeah, he, um, died
of a heart attack.

300
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,968
And then my mom moved in
with me.

301
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,573
Now I'm her caretaker.

302
00:31:49,472 --> 00:31:51,405
Are you and your mother friends?

303
00:31:51,407 --> 00:31:54,111
Oh yeah, God,
I tell her everything.

304
00:31:54,678 --> 00:31:55,413
Luna Peligrosa.

305
00:31:57,146 --> 00:31:58,479
You remember her name?

306
00:31:58,481 --> 00:32:00,117
(laughing) I do.

307
00:32:01,451 --> 00:32:03,584
What does it mean?

308
00:32:03,586 --> 00:32:05,420
[Alma] Dangerous moon.

309
00:32:05,422 --> 00:32:07,458
[Zaynab] How did she get that?

310
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:12,562
You know, I don't know,
actually.

311
00:32:13,463 --> 00:32:16,030
So what about you?

312
00:32:16,032 --> 00:32:18,201
Alma, what does that mean?

313
00:32:19,202 --> 00:32:21,303
In Spanish, it means, soul.

314
00:32:21,305 --> 00:32:22,136
[Zaynab] Soul.

315
00:32:22,138 --> 00:32:22,973
[Alma] Yeah.

316
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,774
[Zaynab] So, tell me

317
00:32:25,776 --> 00:32:27,612
something else I don't know
about you.

318
00:32:29,346 --> 00:32:32,349
Hmm, I was in a telenovela.

319
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,082
Come on.

320
00:32:34,084 --> 00:32:35,549
Yeah, really, back in Mexico.

321
00:32:35,551 --> 00:32:37,686
I was a kid, literally, a child.

322
00:32:37,688 --> 00:32:39,520
And actually terrible.

323
00:32:39,522 --> 00:32:41,391
They didn't use my cut
for broadcast.

324
00:32:42,459 --> 00:32:44,026
I would be so much better, now.

325
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:46,297
(Zaynab laughing)

326
00:32:55,372 --> 00:32:56,407
Sh, sh.

327
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,841
I know you're supposed
to be good for us,

328
00:33:32,843 --> 00:33:35,580
because you eat
all the bad bugs.

329
00:34:52,422 --> 00:34:55,259
Mom, I can't, I'm,
uh, meeting my friend.

330
00:34:58,594 --> 00:35:00,430
Okay, well, I want to
meet your friends, so...

331
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,583
My mother wants to meet you.

332
00:35:21,585 --> 00:35:24,889
Oh no, I don't want
to meet your mother.

333
00:35:27,623 --> 00:35:28,625
You don't?

334
00:35:29,425 --> 00:35:30,894
Okay, cool.

335
00:35:35,865 --> 00:35:36,701
Wait a minute.

336
00:35:39,469 --> 00:35:40,570
Why don't you want
to meet my mother?

337
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:44,505
I want to meet your mother.

338
00:35:44,507 --> 00:35:45,974
The reason you want
to meet my mother

339
00:35:45,976 --> 00:35:48,510
is very different from why I
don't want to meet your mother.

340
00:35:48,512 --> 00:35:51,182
Mother meeting means
a relationship.

341
00:35:52,315 --> 00:35:54,584
I'm not in this
for a relationship.

342
00:36:02,259 --> 00:36:02,894
Me neither.

343
00:36:19,775 --> 00:36:22,646
(percussive music)

344
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:20,605
Yeah, focus on technique!

345
00:37:21,605 --> 00:37:23,405
Alright.

346
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,673
Shoot out.

347
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,474
Double leg takedown, let's go.

348
00:37:26,476 --> 00:37:27,608
Yes.

349
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:30,811
Headlock, headlock,
get in there.

350
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:33,750
Use your hips, use your hips!

351
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:36,621
Use your, whoa.

352
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:38,722
Okay, this...

353
00:37:40,356 --> 00:37:40,992
Is...

354
00:37:41,724 --> 00:37:42,626
Hey, this is not a move.

355
00:37:47,597 --> 00:37:49,567
What, it's that girl?

356
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:56,704
The only way to get the girl
is not be afraid of losing her.

357
00:37:56,706 --> 00:37:58,706
Because it is not about winning.

358
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:00,810
It is about everything else.

359
00:38:01,711 --> 00:38:03,478
What you're feeling right now,

360
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,851
you need to learn to
harness it, channel it,

361
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:10,588
and use it to your advantage.

362
00:38:10,853 --> 00:38:11,489
Ow.

363
00:38:14,891 --> 00:38:15,726

Bye, Mom.

381
00:39:58,061 --> 00:40:00,030
I'm, uh, going
to go meet a friend.

382
00:40:00,996 --> 00:40:02,932
Friend,
does he have potential?

383
00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:07,538
What about me, Mom,
do I have potential?

384
00:41:41,297 --> 00:41:42,130
Are you sure?

385
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:42,963
Yeah.

386
00:41:42,965 --> 00:41:43,998
I don't know.

387
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,135
I promise you.

388
00:41:46,735 --> 00:41:48,204
[Bouncer] Hey, pretty.
Where's your girl?

389
00:41:52,742 --> 00:41:54,945
(club music)

390
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:16,032
(bell rings)

391
00:42:18,034 --> 00:42:22,006
She is known as the queen
of chaos, Lucy Vicious.

392
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,777
(audience cheers)

393
00:42:29,778 --> 00:42:33,951
And her opponent, she is known
as the Appalachian Assassin.

394
00:42:36,251 --> 00:42:37,887
It's Darcy Dixon.

395
00:42:42,958 --> 00:42:45,860
(bell rings)

396
00:42:45,862 --> 00:42:47,898
(grunting)

397
00:42:56,739 --> 00:42:58,741
Whoo, yeah, augh, woo.

398
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,593
Get on there, woo.

399
00:43:22,998 --> 00:43:25,233
Here, break it up.

400
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:27,938
[Announcer] Oh, ref is down.

401
00:43:30,806 --> 00:43:31,641
Woohoo.

402
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,976
[Announcer] Keep it
pumped up, chica!

403
00:43:34,978 --> 00:43:37,077
Yeah, get her down!

404
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:39,248
Lucy, we love you!

405
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:42,886
[Announcer] Lucy Mendez
coming back!

406
00:43:46,088 --> 00:43:49,226
Woo, okay, I'm going
to be right back.

407
00:43:52,461 --> 00:43:54,128
[Announcer] Keep it going
y'all,

408
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:57,097
for your champion, Lucy Mendez.

409
00:43:57,099 --> 00:43:58,298
Woo, here, put this on.

410
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,135
Okay.

411
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:03,841
Lucy, you're a goddess!

412
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:05,376
Woohoo!

413
00:44:06,108 --> 00:44:08,277
You should do this.

414
00:44:09,012 --> 00:44:10,077
I could never do this.

415
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,144
Yeah.

416
00:44:11,146 --> 00:44:12,982
I wrestle
for existential reasons.

417
00:44:13,983 --> 00:44:15,419
Immigration and codependency.

418
00:44:18,021 --> 00:44:20,691
(street noises)

419
00:44:26,061 --> 00:44:27,096
Ooh.

420
00:44:32,869 --> 00:44:37,041
Okay, my mom's going to
go through that in a day.

421
00:44:38,074 --> 00:44:39,139
Maybe we should skip
the papaya.

422
00:44:39,141 --> 00:44:41,275
(laughs)

423
00:44:41,277 --> 00:44:43,344
There are also some,
uh, mangoes back there,

424
00:44:43,346 --> 00:44:44,912
if you wanted to get some.

425
00:44:44,914 --> 00:44:47,148
Nah, the Mexican ones
just aren't as sweet.

426
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:50,119
That's not what you said
last night.

427
00:45:34,297 --> 00:45:36,132
(Parveen humming)

428
00:46:05,327 --> 00:46:06,163
Alli, ma.

429
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:07,561
[Rosa] Gracias, mijo.

430
00:46:07,563 --> 00:46:08,364
De nada.

431
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:10,134
(festive music)

432
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,202
You like Carlos?

433
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:24,413
Mama, ay.

434
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:25,949
(laughing)

435
00:46:28,985 --> 00:46:33,157
Ay, Carlos reminds me
of another man I knew.

436
00:46:34,289 --> 00:46:35,125
Who?

437
00:46:40,163 --> 00:46:41,197
(spits)

438
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:58,182
So what happened?

439
00:47:06,389 --> 00:47:07,490
Ay, no.

440
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:09,326
Peligrosa.

441
00:47:16,965 --> 00:47:17,601
Luna Peligrosa.

442
00:47:19,902 --> 00:47:20,536
Huh.

443
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:09,586
(Pakistani pop music)

444
00:49:02,505 --> 00:49:05,943
I feel like
you're keeping me secret.

445
00:49:16,018 --> 00:49:17,586
It's not about you.

446
00:49:23,092 --> 00:49:25,095
I mean, it is about you,

447
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:29,399
because it's
about my personal life.

448
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:35,672
But, it's not about you,
you know?

449
00:49:49,117 --> 00:49:51,355
Well, I don't keep secrets.

450
00:50:04,467 --> 00:50:06,135
Hold still, Mom. Come on.

451
00:50:11,606 --> 00:50:13,409
Sorry, sorry, sh.

452
00:50:17,146 --> 00:50:20,384
Just one more, one more,
come on, come on, come on.

453
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:25,255
Uh, she should be here soon.

454
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:31,294
A couple years.

455
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:36,299
Not that I know of.

456
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:38,434
One more, one more, one, one.

457
00:50:47,543 --> 00:50:48,378
[Zaynab] Okay.

458
00:50:51,746 --> 00:50:52,815
Can I go now?

459
00:51:06,195 --> 00:51:07,461
[Parveen] You eat meat?

460
00:51:07,463 --> 00:51:10,363
Yep, you know,
I tried veganism once,

461
00:51:10,365 --> 00:51:12,566
but it kind of felt like it
was going against my roots.

462
00:51:12,568 --> 00:51:14,501
I also tried once.

463
00:51:14,503 --> 00:51:15,337
You did?

464
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:19,173
Oh, oh, that's too much
filling.

465
00:51:19,175 --> 00:51:20,574
Remove it, remove it.

466
00:51:20,576 --> 00:51:22,709
And fold it properly.

467
00:51:22,711 --> 00:51:24,815
Here, let me show to you.

468
00:51:30,552 --> 00:51:34,156
This reminds me of making
tamales at home with my family.

469
00:51:46,235 --> 00:51:48,601
He is fan favorite
in Pakistan.

470
00:51:48,603 --> 00:51:50,336
Hmm.

471
00:51:50,338 --> 00:51:53,742
You know like, that, um,
that star, what is his name.

472
00:51:54,943 --> 00:51:58,248
Um, sound like a baby animal,
Zaynab?

473
00:51:59,447 --> 00:52:01,347
Ryan Gosling.

474
00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:02,618
Hmm, Goose-ling.

475
00:52:04,186 --> 00:52:05,885
(laughing)

476
00:52:05,887 --> 00:52:09,557
So handsome, Zaynab's
father was not so handsome.

477
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:10,560
Mom.

478
00:52:11,626 --> 00:52:13,130
But, but very intelligent.

479
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:17,798
Hmm, he used to read
every single book.

480
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,700
Aw, did Zaynab tell you
that I owned a bookstore?

481
00:52:20,702 --> 00:52:24,708
No, Zaynab has not told
me anything about you.

482
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:28,775
Well, I was thinking
it would be nicer, but...

483
00:52:28,777 --> 00:52:30,312
Mm, mm, drama.

484
00:52:31,646 --> 00:52:32,481
Drama.

485
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:39,653
This is totally
like a telenovela.

486
00:52:39,655 --> 00:52:41,487
Like what?

487
00:52:41,489 --> 00:52:44,493
Oh, um, tele-no-vela.

488
00:52:45,327 --> 00:52:47,831
Tele-no-vela.

489
00:52:49,264 --> 00:52:52,536
Mm-hmm, Spanish-speaking
soap operas.

490
00:52:53,501 --> 00:52:54,336
May I?

491
00:52:55,838 --> 00:52:56,670
[Parveen] Uh.

492
00:52:56,672 --> 00:52:58,407
(chuckling)

493
00:53:02,311 --> 00:53:06,383
(dramatic Spanish dialogue)

494
00:53:12,788 --> 00:53:14,590
That's just like my dramas.

495
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:16,590
Yeah, minus the
kissing and the cleavage.

496
00:53:16,592 --> 00:53:18,325
Hmm, what did you say?

497
00:53:18,327 --> 00:53:18,961
Nothing.

498
00:53:20,496 --> 00:53:22,762
Just, Mom, you don't even, like,

499
00:53:22,764 --> 00:53:23,998
know what they're saying?

500
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,969
How can you even,
like, enjoy it?

501
00:53:27,302 --> 00:53:28,538
You don't need to
understand the language.

502
00:53:29,271 --> 00:53:31,807
You just feel it.

503
00:53:33,509 --> 00:53:35,679
These two love each other.

504
00:53:40,849 --> 00:53:42,384
Are you married?

505
00:53:44,586 --> 00:53:45,621
Oh, no.

506
00:53:47,422 --> 00:53:49,990
We should find you a husband.

507
00:53:49,992 --> 00:53:53,930
But before that, we must
find Zaynab a husband.

508
00:53:56,065 --> 00:53:59,333
Do you know any potentials?

509
00:53:59,335 --> 00:53:59,970
No.

510
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:05,742
I don't know anyone who would
want to marry your daughter.

511
00:54:28,931 --> 00:54:32,936
Hey, hey, I am so sorry
about my mother, okay?

512
00:54:36,038 --> 00:54:38,639
That was so awkward,
you were right.

513
00:54:38,641 --> 00:54:41,641
Meeting mothers, terrible idea.

514
00:54:41,643 --> 00:54:44,077
Maybe this is a terrible idea.

515
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,679
If you're actually looking
for a husband, then, I mean...

516
00:54:46,681 --> 00:54:48,816
Uh, I'm not looking
for a husband.

517
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:49,983
You don't understand.

518
00:54:49,985 --> 00:54:51,452
No, I understand.

519
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:52,786
I understand perfectly
what's going on here,

520
00:54:52,788 --> 00:54:55,655
and I don't want anything
to do with it.

521
00:54:55,657 --> 00:54:57,891
I don't want to do this anymore.

522
00:54:57,893 --> 00:54:59,425
Do what?

523
00:54:59,427 --> 00:55:00,894
This, any of this, you, me.

524
00:55:00,896 --> 00:55:03,697
There's always a thing,
with every girl.

525
00:55:03,699 --> 00:55:06,735
With you, it's secrets
and lying.

526
00:55:08,536 --> 00:55:10,773
I have never lied to you.

527
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:14,742
You are lying to your mother.

528
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:16,677
And a lot of other people
in your life,

529
00:55:16,679 --> 00:55:19,679
about what you like to do
in private.

530
00:55:19,681 --> 00:55:21,914
Look, I'm just trying
to figure it all out.

531
00:55:21,916 --> 00:55:23,416
It's hard.

532
00:55:23,418 --> 00:55:24,650
You don't know the way
I was raised.

533
00:55:24,652 --> 00:55:26,153
No, we're not that different.

534
00:55:26,155 --> 00:55:28,588
I get the whole mother, and
respect, and family thing.

535
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:30,891
And you're not in high school.

536
00:55:30,893 --> 00:55:34,998
And clearly, your mother
knows nothing about you.

537
00:55:36,632 --> 00:55:38,798
Honestly, I don't even know
what we're arguing about.

538
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,934
I mean, you do realize that
we don't know each other

539
00:55:40,936 --> 00:55:42,769
well enough to be doing this,
right?

540
00:55:42,771 --> 00:55:46,742
I mean, I don't know you
well enough to be this upset.

541
00:55:47,943 --> 00:55:49,142
This is so lesbian, this
is, this is so lesbian.

542
00:55:49,144 --> 00:55:51,744
I mean, seriously, this
is the gayest thing

543
00:55:51,746 --> 00:55:53,079
we could be doing right now.

544
00:55:53,081 --> 00:55:54,715
You buzz around like
you know everything

545
00:55:54,717 --> 00:55:56,182
there is to know about women,

546
00:55:56,184 --> 00:55:57,950
because you're so experienced

547
00:55:57,952 --> 00:56:00,787
and you're so much
better at this than I am.

548
00:56:00,789 --> 00:56:01,791
I am.

549
00:56:07,028 --> 00:56:09,699
Look, I am my mother's person.

550
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:15,805
I am her person.

551
00:56:17,773 --> 00:56:18,771
She doesn't go out.

552
00:56:18,773 --> 00:56:19,773
She doesn't do anything.

553
00:56:19,775 --> 00:56:20,974
She doesn't see anybody.

554
00:56:20,976 --> 00:56:22,846
I am her everything.

555
00:56:23,746 --> 00:56:27,213
I'm her friend, her,
her companion,

556
00:56:27,215 --> 00:56:31,587
her mother, her chef, her,
I'm her fucked up daughter.

557
00:56:36,891 --> 00:56:40,028
Well, I don't go backwards
for anyone.

558
00:56:43,565 --> 00:56:46,502
I'm not gonna do it
for you either.

559
00:57:20,735 --> 00:57:21,570
Yeah.

560
00:57:23,806 --> 00:57:24,641
She left.

561
00:57:29,777 --> 00:57:31,079
Mom, can you stop?

562
00:57:35,684 --> 00:57:38,822
Moving these,
they don't go like this.

563
00:57:42,224 --> 00:57:43,789
It's not your flow.

564
00:57:43,791 --> 00:57:44,791
It's my flow.

565
00:57:44,793 --> 00:57:46,963
I can flow however I want.

566
00:58:00,842 --> 00:58:01,844
[Zaynab] Whoa! (groaning)

567
00:58:05,813 --> 00:58:07,246
I need you.

568
00:58:07,248 --> 00:58:08,851
Oh.

569
00:58:11,853 --> 00:58:12,888
No...

570
00:58:15,123 --> 00:58:15,958
No.

571
00:58:17,893 --> 00:58:19,128
You were right.

572
00:58:20,161 --> 00:58:21,830
Women are the worst.

573
00:58:23,998 --> 00:58:26,900
Stick with the emotionally
unavailable.

574
00:58:26,902 --> 00:58:27,936
Ugh, no.

575
00:58:30,672 --> 00:58:33,909
I need you to compete
in the Lucha match.

576
00:58:34,976 --> 00:58:36,112
I can't do it, my knee's blown.

577
00:58:36,911 --> 00:58:37,913
I'll train you.

578
00:58:39,114 --> 00:58:41,014
Do you think I have a shot
at winning?

579
00:58:41,016 --> 00:58:42,950
Oh, no, absolutely not.

580
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:45,021
You're gonna get creamed.

581
00:58:46,355 --> 00:58:48,590
No, no, I'm a lawyer.

582
00:58:49,123 --> 00:58:50,058
I'm not a wrestler.

583
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:54,764
Objection, you're not a
wrestler, yet.

584
00:58:55,998 --> 00:58:56,833
Oh.

585
00:58:58,099 --> 00:58:59,868
Objection overruled!

586
00:59:05,306 --> 00:59:07,943
Why does she keep hitting me?

587
00:59:21,956 --> 00:59:24,059
Yeah, tell me about it.

588
00:59:27,061 --> 00:59:27,896
No.

589
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,135
Yes.

590
00:59:35,971 --> 00:59:36,806
No.

591
00:59:38,706 --> 00:59:41,009
No, I mean, yes.

592
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:43,946
I mean, well, kind of.

593
00:59:47,048 --> 00:59:48,016
She's secretive.

594
00:59:49,818 --> 00:59:50,653
No.

595
00:59:53,322 --> 00:59:54,157
No.

596
01:00:19,815 --> 01:00:21,748
Yeah, but that was
a different time.

597
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:23,050
It was a different place.

598
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:24,086
Things are different now.

599
01:00:57,985 --> 01:01:01,123
You never wrestled
after I was born?

600
01:01:02,157 --> 01:01:03,826
Was I worth it?

601
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:06,396
Mija...

602
01:01:15,369 --> 01:01:16,204
You.

603
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:31,153
Gym.

604
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:38,960
God, why does everybody
keep...

605
01:01:42,764 --> 01:01:44,132
It's a wrestling mask.

606
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:46,034
I wrestle.

607
01:01:51,172 --> 01:01:52,007
Wrestle?

608
01:01:56,244 --> 01:01:57,079
No, I wrestle with women.

609
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:04,316
It's just this thing
that I do.

610
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:06,121
You know, like you pray
and watch Pakistani dramas.

611
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:13,193
I'm just trying to live
my life.

612
01:02:13,195 --> 01:02:15,394
Maybe you should go live yours.

613
01:02:15,396 --> 01:02:16,932
I am living my life!

614
01:02:27,208 --> 01:02:28,310
Live my life.

615
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:46,996
I saw you with your friend.

616
01:03:01,108 --> 01:03:03,179
I have a right to know.

617
01:03:06,181 --> 01:03:07,983
Zaynab?

618
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:08,985
Zaynab?

619
01:03:12,554 --> 01:03:13,389
Zaynab?

620
01:03:15,289 --> 01:03:16,125
Zaynab?

621
01:05:20,681 --> 01:05:22,081
All right, now this one?

622
01:05:22,083 --> 01:05:25,251
This is Hopewell's
cold brew coffee beer.

623
01:05:25,253 --> 01:05:27,487
Now it's just like having
a full cup of coffee,

624
01:05:27,489 --> 01:05:29,555
except it's better,
'cause it's beer.

625
01:05:29,557 --> 01:05:30,990
(laughing)

626
01:05:30,992 --> 01:05:32,092
All right, I'm gonna
start with this one.

627
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:33,061
I don't trust him.

628
01:05:44,505 --> 01:05:45,340
You.

629
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:51,981
You are awesome,
and I like you a lot.

630
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:58,385
Your path is your path,

631
01:05:58,387 --> 01:06:01,755
and it's a beautiful
and inspiring path.

632
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:05,394
But, your path isn't
better than my path.

633
01:06:07,094 --> 01:06:08,563
It's just different.

634
01:06:11,465 --> 01:06:13,402
And, my mother and I,

635
01:06:15,570 --> 01:06:17,269
we do have a weird

636
01:06:17,271 --> 01:06:19,375
and dysfunctional relationship
maybe.

637
01:06:20,342 --> 01:06:21,744
Okay, definitely.

638
01:06:24,045 --> 01:06:27,146
But that doesn't make it wrong.

639
01:06:27,148 --> 01:06:30,050
I have to live my life, my way.

640
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:34,123
And that does not mean
that I'm moving backwards.

641
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:38,326
(slow clapping)

642
01:06:40,094 --> 01:06:41,196
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

643
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:43,065
I'm fine.

644
01:06:52,673 --> 01:06:55,378
Is that your signature move?

645
01:06:56,411 --> 01:06:58,811
Whose side are you on?

646
01:06:58,813 --> 01:07:01,680
Well, Erik Astrada
does have a good point.

647
01:07:01,682 --> 01:07:03,550
Yo, this girl has gotten
to you.

648
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:06,853
She likes you, and you
like her, I know this.

649
01:07:06,855 --> 01:07:08,490
But, she's right.

650
01:07:09,623 --> 01:07:11,523
She's got her own path.

651
01:07:11,525 --> 01:07:13,793
I'm not gonna compromise
for someone else.

652
01:07:13,795 --> 01:07:15,360
I am who I am.

653
01:07:15,362 --> 01:07:17,365
Please, I am who I am.

654
01:07:19,367 --> 01:07:20,833
You've been felt up.

655
01:07:20,835 --> 01:07:23,103
You're just feeling
your feelings.

656
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:24,572
It's not compromise.

657
01:07:27,576 --> 01:07:29,141
Hey, what, what,
what are you doing?

658
01:07:29,143 --> 01:07:30,476
Hey, you've got
to cleanse your palate.

659
01:07:30,478 --> 01:07:33,345
Exactly, you've gotta
cleanse your palate.

660
01:07:33,347 --> 01:07:36,516
So you can really taste
this one.

661
01:07:36,518 --> 01:07:38,320
She's pretty sweet.

662
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:41,320
I'm just speculating.

663
01:07:41,322 --> 01:07:43,391
(Jayde grunting)

664
01:07:49,797 --> 01:07:51,130
Train me.

665
01:07:51,132 --> 01:07:53,566
No, no, no, you were right.

666
01:07:53,568 --> 01:07:54,403
You're a lawyer.

667
01:07:56,304 --> 01:07:57,472
I need this.

668
01:08:00,641 --> 01:08:03,244
Are you, are you gonna cry?

669
01:08:11,286 --> 01:08:13,121
All right, I'll do it.

670
01:08:13,588 --> 01:08:14,423
Uh.

671
01:08:20,395 --> 01:08:21,230
Rah.

672
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:25,501
(upbeat Pakistani music)

673
01:08:29,503 --> 01:08:31,539
(grunting)

674
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:09,878

679
01:10:50,712 --> 01:10:52,945
Okay, now don't get
distracted by the crowd.

680
01:10:52,947 --> 01:10:54,613
They're supposed to pick sides.

681
01:10:54,615 --> 01:10:58,554
And if they're booing,
you're doing your job.

682
01:11:17,572 --> 01:11:18,571
[Bouncer] Name?

683
01:11:18,573 --> 01:11:19,742
Uh, Parveen.

684
01:11:21,775 --> 01:11:25,745
Ma'am, you're not
on the list, you VIP?

685
01:11:25,747 --> 01:11:28,680
Very important Pakistani.

686
01:11:28,682 --> 01:11:29,949
Okay, seriously,
you're not on the list.

687
01:11:29,951 --> 01:11:31,951
You're holding up
the line, ma'am.

688
01:11:31,953 --> 01:11:33,919
But my daughter is inside.

689
01:11:33,921 --> 01:11:35,354
She's with me.

690
01:11:35,356 --> 01:11:35,990
Ah.

691
01:11:41,796 --> 01:11:44,363
[Alma] Mrs. Qadir,
what are you doing here?

692
01:11:44,365 --> 01:11:45,634
[Parveen] I don't know.

693
01:11:49,570 --> 01:11:50,602
Where is Zaynab?

694
01:11:50,604 --> 01:11:51,470
[Alma] I don't know.

695
01:11:51,472 --> 01:11:55,375
Mrs. Qadir, this is my
mother, Rosa.

696
01:11:55,377 --> 01:11:56,945
[Rosa] Your
daughter is Zaynab?

697
01:11:57,979 --> 01:11:58,613
Yeah.

698
01:11:59,713 --> 01:12:03,683
[Rosa] (shouting in Spanish)

699
01:12:03,685 --> 01:12:04,520
Woo!

700
01:12:24,139 --> 01:12:26,839
(bell rings)

701
01:12:26,841 --> 01:12:27,843
Yeah, woo.

702
01:12:38,051 --> 01:12:41,956
Welcome to this month's
all lady lucha libre!

703
01:12:44,826 --> 01:12:47,626
Introducing, we got
a first-timer, y'all.

704
01:12:47,628 --> 01:12:48,863
A lucha virgin.

705
01:12:50,064 --> 01:12:53,668
Coming to you from Rogers
Park, it's Jasmine Z.

706
01:12:57,704 --> 01:12:58,740
Oh.

707
01:13:06,847 --> 01:13:07,882
Zaynab?

708
01:13:08,783 --> 01:13:10,982
All right, all right,

709
01:13:10,984 --> 01:13:15,156
representing the...
(environmental noise)

710
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:17,393
it's Ragina Cruz!

711
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:24,098
Yeah, ha ha.

712
01:13:33,942 --> 01:13:35,508
Get ready, ring the bell.

713
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:37,175
(bell rings)

714
01:13:37,177 --> 01:13:39,648
(grunting)

715
01:13:41,248 --> 01:13:42,083
Zaynab.

716
01:13:45,886 --> 01:13:48,724
[Regina] How do you like
me now?

717
01:13:59,567 --> 01:14:02,668
It's not real, you know,
it's like our dramas.

718
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:03,870
It's not real.

719
01:14:03,872 --> 01:14:05,670
No, it's real.

720
01:14:05,672 --> 01:14:06,505
Mom.

721
01:14:06,507 --> 01:14:08,510
She's doing very good.

722
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:12,780
Yes, Zaynab!

723
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:14,817
Get her.

724
01:14:15,949 --> 01:14:16,952
Oh, oh, ooh.

725
01:14:19,887 --> 01:14:20,820
Zaynab?

726
01:14:20,822 --> 01:14:21,556
No, no, just stay here.

727
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:23,158
She's doing great.

728
01:14:27,561 --> 01:14:28,197
Oh, oh.

729
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:33,469
Careful.

730
01:14:34,969 --> 01:14:37,239
(grunting)

731
01:14:40,274 --> 01:14:41,976
One, two, three.

732
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:44,242
No.

733
01:14:44,244 --> 01:14:46,111
Ring the bell,
