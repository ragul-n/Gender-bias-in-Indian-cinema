00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:53,993
You dont understand what
he wanna say?

167
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:58,130
He wont say anything

168
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:01,969
what are you saying?
I'm saying correct

169
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:11,474
if lawyer will ask anything then
this old man will say everything

170
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:17,119
and if anyone see him then
they will kill him

171
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:27,327
now what we do?

172
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:31,093
He shouldn't say anything

173
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:34,472
if you say yes then

174
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:41,235
i dont believe.
He cant do this

175
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:44,036
there is something behind it

176
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:45,875
father its right

177
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,202
he was asking for double salary
and we said no

178
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:51,975
we said ok leave it

179
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:04,990
how he said this?

180
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,107
This is now become a big problem

181
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:57,147
bridge is not blasted with a bomb

182
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:00,976
and contractor driver did not
commit suicude

183

he gave us some money

594
01:51:50,637 --> 01:51:55,074
its better to beg on the road,
rather than borrow money from you

595
01:51:57,043 --> 01:51:58,635

596

01:53:15,421 --> 01:53:18,185

i dont come here to say sorry

608
01:55:24,884 --> 01:55:28,513
because i know i dont
deserve forgiveness

609
01:55:30,290 --> 01:55:33,020
i became blind

610
01:55:46,973 --> 01:55:49,066
after a long time we met
on strange situation

611
01:55:52,612 --> 01:55:56,946
i was feeling myself very small

612
01:56:09,395 --> 01:56:15,095
i thought when i become something
then i will come back

613
01:56:17,303 --> 01:56:19,931
because i was walking on a
correct way

614
02:01:45,865 --> 02:01:47,799
your sister called me

615
02:01:48,267 --> 02:01:49,131

620
02:02:45,858 --> 02:02:46,756
where were you?

621
02:02:47,226 --> 02:02:48,557
We were searching for you

622
02:05:03,829 --> 02:05:06,764
he is azaad bhagat and he is
sachin

623
02:05:07,733 --> 02:05:09,030
how do you know him?

624
02:05:13,305 --> 02:05:16,672
He was stealing something from
my sister house

625
02:05:20,112 --> 02:05:21,443
i think you have a misunderstanding

626
02:05:23,849 --> 02:05:25,146
but he is not a thief

627
02:05:54,680 --> 02:05:55,874
where you find it?

628
02:05:56,448 --> 02:05:59,383
I searched by myself

629
02:06:17,169 --> 02:06:19,296
i need your help

630
02:06:19,972 --> 02:06:22,964
look at these files,
it has many truths

631
02:06:37,323 --> 02:06:38,381
where is that red file?

632
02:06:39,191 --> 02:06:40,283
I lost it.
Why you write everything?

633
02:06:47,032 --> 02:06:49,023
Thats why i have to make
files for everyone

634
02:06:50,069 --> 02:06:52,560
everybody knows who is
thief

635
02:07:13,892 --> 02:07:15,519
what about remaining 200 crores?

636
02:07:22,001 --> 02:07:24,299
Everybody took his money

637
02:07:24,770 --> 02:07:26,237
and you all are blaming me?

638
02:07:56,201 --> 02:08:00,160
Leader told me to buy cement
from his relative

639
02:08:00,939 --> 02:08:04,841
he gave me white powder instead
of cement

640
02:08:08,113 --> 02:08:10,707
i made the biggest mistake of my life
by giving you contract

641
02:08:17,556 --> 02:08:19,581
what about that pipe line?

642
02:08:23,629 --> 02:08:25,221
You placed 2 feet pipes in it

643
02:08:26,498 --> 02:08:30,093
and this engineer is involved
in it

644
02:08:38,877 --> 02:08:43,576
the money we saved in pipe lines,
we used in making farm house

645
02:08:44,116 --> 02:08:45,743
do you any record?

646
02:08:47,052 --> 02:08:50,419
I knew it you will do this

647
02:08:52,291 --> 02:08:54,316
thats why i record everything

648
02:09:03,202 --> 02:09:05,397
if i got arrested then i will
say everyone's name

649
02:09:09,441 --> 02:09:10,772
nobody will go inside

650
02:09:11,410 --> 02:09:14,743
and that commissioner wont do
any case too

651
02:09:19,384 --> 02:09:21,284
i know what i have to do

652
02:09:38,270 --> 02:09:40,261
from now he will sit on your seat

653
02:09:41,073 --> 02:09:42,904
but nobody told me this

654
02:09:52,851 --> 02:09:56,844
if truth is open than big names
will come out

655
02:10:02,494 --> 02:10:04,018
i dont need anyone's help

656
02:10:10,068 --> 02:10:11,535
i have whole record

657
02:10:12,337 --> 02:10:14,897
truth and justice is still
in the house

658
02:12:10,989 --> 02:12:12,479
operation theatre is busy,
you wait here

659
02:14:11,810 --> 02:14:15,974
may be she commit suicide

660
02:14:18,850 --> 02:14:21,410
and if she is still alive then she
will be killed

661
02:14:55,120 --> 02:14:56,781
where you have hide the red file?

662
02:15:08,333 --> 02:15:10,358
They know where is that red file?

663
02:15:12,270 --> 02:15:14,238
I dont know how they know

664
02:15:14,840 --> 02:15:16,307
we cant take risk

665
02:16:12,097 --> 02:16:13,689
tell him that i took the bag

666
02:16:14,065 --> 02:16:15,191
i will call him

667
02:20:48,406 --> 02:20:52,866
if i would know this that you live
here than i would not give my sister

668
02:20:53,445 --> 02:20:55,037
i'm saying kill him

669
02:20:57,081 --> 02:20:59,641
you killed the hands that give
you food

670
02:21:00,351 --> 02:21:03,650
you did not succeed like your
brother in law

671
02:21:04,255 --> 02:21:07,656
because ofjealousy you put them
in jail

672
02:21:12,530 --> 02:21:15,090
it would be better if you
give us poison

673
02:21:15,867 --> 02:21:17,300
let her speak

674
02:21:20,505 --> 02:21:22,063
because i'm about to say

675
02:21:24,742 --> 02:21:27,973
when they were taking my younger sister,
why you were not crying?

676
02:21:30,515 --> 02:21:32,642
Where were these faces?

677
02:21:33,351 --> 02:21:39,347
Because you love you husbands more,
or you knew your husbands are responsible

678
02:21:47,599 --> 02:21:50,090
on that time i did not had
permission to speak

679
02:21:50,635 --> 02:21:54,002
if on that time i spoke something,
then my sister would not die

680
02:21:55,540 --> 02:21:58,998
your husbands are still alive but
my daughter is died

681
02:22:23,468 --> 02:22:29,771
when newspaper were about to bring the
reality outside then they give them money

682
02:22:30,441 --> 02:22:33,376
and they blame uncle

683
02:22:36,614 --> 02:22:39,139
after that their husbands are not
saved

684
02:22:54,766 --> 02:22:57,291
i have decided i wont stay
in this house

685
02:23:10,915 --> 02:23:16,785
i say sorry for everything

686
02:23:27,765 --> 02:23:33,704
i will go anywhere but i will never
let your face down

687
02:23:35,440 --> 02:23:36,464
its my promise

688
02:24:04,636 --> 02:24:08,538
whatever you have done,
is correct

689
02:24:09,407 --> 02:24:12,968
i'm proud of you

690
02:24:33,264 --> 02:24:35,425
are you leaving everything?

691
02:24:41,305 --> 02:24:43,273
I need some peace

692
02:24:44,042 --> 02:24:46,340
dont know what i will do
in future

693
02:24:50,214 --> 02:24:54,048
and everyone wants you start
work again

694
02:24:54,886 --> 02:24:58,378
and they are saying that i
give you work

695
02:24:59,023 --> 02:25:01,924
they are saying thats why you
are giving me work?

696
02:25:06,464 --> 02:25:08,193
You did not ask one question from me?

697
02:25:08,766 --> 02:25:11,257
Why i did not marry?

698
02:25:14,739 --> 02:25:16,502
Let me ask now

699
02:25:16,941 --> 02:25:17,930
why you did not marry?

700
02:25:18,710 --> 02:25:23,010
Always i was feeling that one
day i will meet you

701
02:25:25,683 --> 02:25:30,245
i know without you my life
will be incomplete

702
02:25:36,961 --> 02:25:38,258
so when you are going to
change your name?
