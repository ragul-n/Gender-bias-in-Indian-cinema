Government has increased taxes.

Sir..You are throwing
away whatever you write.

5
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,430
Yes..I am not able to concentrate.

6
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:12,401
I stan on something and then
I feel this is not what I should say..

7
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:19,143
For dinner, what will you have
as side dish for chappathi, Sir?

8

For chappathi? A good story..

Why? You have no stories?

13

This raw Iife as they say... Is it sir?

15
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:45,365
Raw or ripe.. The imponance

I am asking you seriously..

17

Do you have a story to tell?

18
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:57,279
That... there is no beginning

a beginning and an end.Is in it Sir?

Even though he is a Iabourer,
they call him Prabhu, the Lord.

Poor gUV-

56

For us, he is not a servant
but someone to depend upon..

How will you convince Benjamin Sir.

73
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,431
He is a strict person.

74
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,805
We can give him some excuse..

75
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:46,873

00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:51,504
On the way,
I had to feed a child.

No way.. No way..

You knowthatl buy milkfor my kids.

80
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:00,851
It should not be Iess even on one day.

M

82

Then only they will get
enough calcium and protein.

83
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,264
Not only that, if Ranjan gets
more milk Ranjini will get angry.

84
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,142
That is why I gave them
my children's name itself.

85
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:27,973
If anything happens to their healthl!

86
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,911

109
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,982
No. Finding it very difficult
to pay her hostel fees today.

If you ask for a Ioan today also, I will

00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,611
If they are sold,
I will call and pay you.

180
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:35,424
I don't have the capacity
to invest money to buy stock.

181
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:40,153
I am struggling even to pay
the daily savings here

182
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:12,995
6 Lunches.

183
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:14,028
Where is your friend today?

184
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:14,859
On Ieave...

185
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:18,796
You don't want fish fry?

186
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,035
Two special fish.

187
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:23,070
No plastic covers from today onwards.

188
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,605
Municipality's green protocol.

189
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:27,508
There are cloth bags..
Costs 5 rupees.

190
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,603
No... I don't need..

191
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,801
Give me your phone,
Rayappan.

192
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:15,653
Dear..

193
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:18,023
What happened.?
Got the amount ready?

194
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:19,527
No..Papa.

195
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:22,158
I am thinking what to do...

196
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:24,656
She called me.

197
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:28,595
The matron told her she would be
sent out if fees are not paid today.

198
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:31,138
What to do now,
dear?

199
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:34,642
Shall we ask MN sirto Iend some money?

200
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,641
His phone is switched off.

201
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,037
Seems he is not in town.

202
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,949
We should have got it ready
four or five days back...

203
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:47,318
Isn't it the first time that the hostel
authorities are getting so strict?

204
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:52,757
Ravappa.

205
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:55,155
Do you have
five hundred bucks to Iend us?

206
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:57,862
Cut the call..

207
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,864
I have hardly twenty rupees call balance.

208
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,938
Just wasting money...

209
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:05,004
Let me try.. Papa.
I will call you Iater.

210
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:22,883
Why... sister ...?

211
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,243
You Iook gloomy.

212
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:25,218
0h..No..Nothing.

213
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:36,688
Did you bring Iunch?

214
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:37,128
Yes.

215
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,363
Vinee..

216
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,004
Yes.. Sister.

217
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:47,642
Vineetha ..
You are wanted.

218
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:48,708
The manager is angry.

219
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,278
Hurry UP-

220
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:58,014
Don't you know that you have
to mail repons daily to the head office?

221
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:00,422
Then, why don't you do it?

222
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:01,753
Didn't you hear me?

223
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,686
Why don't you do it?

224
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,923
Your salary is credited in youraccount
every month punctually.

225
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,889
When you gobble up your salary

226
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,166
you need some commitment also

227
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:29,284
I won't keep any one here
who is not punctual.

228
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:30,411
Idiots...!!

229
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,183
I am telling you all.

230
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:34,288
Why are you here?

231
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:35,986
Where is your seat?

232
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:36,988
Then go there.

233
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:39,422
Useless guys..

234
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,361
Should resign if one can't work

235
00:28:58,336 --> 00:28:59,974
I want to sell this.

236
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,047
Nly dear sister.

237
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:04,309
No one will buy this.

238
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,219
This is too old,
used by your ancestorsl!

239
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:09,249
I don't need a great price forthis.

240
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:12,359
Just a six hundred or
even five hundred bucks.

241
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:13,791
Dude..Sanand.

242
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,359
This sister wants five hundred forthis.

243
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:19,793
Will you give her?

244
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,233
If there is an inside clip..I will give.

245
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,395
No clip in this.

246
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:25,830
Even sms will not work on this.

247
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,180
Is MN sir here...?

248
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:38,912
No..

249
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,119
He went to Dubai to receive an award.

250
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:42,287
Will be back on Thursday only.

251
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:43,451
Didn't tell you?

252
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:46,395
He asked me to come on Thursday only.

253
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,767
But never said anything about his trip

254
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,030
I had to meet him urgently.

255
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:58,271
You could have made 350 bucks
per person working forjust an hour.

256
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,136
You could have bought
full bottles foryour husbands!!

257
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:03,036
Our husbands have become teetotalersl!

258
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:04,112
Rajiv, Dude...

259
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:10,351
lt is quite difficult to clean that Iarge flat
without a vacuum cleaner and a washing machine.

260
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:13,284
Won't be able to come forwork
again with broken backs..

261
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:14,980
Then you all sit at home..

262
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,390
Go ahead.

263
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:17,856
Pitiablel!

264
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:20,219
What son of work is it?

265
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,390
Newtenants in 9A.

266
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:23,591
On rent.

267
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:27,364
They wanted to clean the flat.

268
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,266
They said they would pay handsomely.

269
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:30,966
How arrogant.

270
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:32,102
You heard theml!

271
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:33,507
They need vacuum cleaner!!

272
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:35,573
I will do it Rajiv.

273
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,569
I have enough time.

274
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:37,543
AIo ne?

275
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,512
Doesn't matter.

276
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:44,015
Come before they call
someone through a mobile app.

277
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,532
Rajiv,
That was a great help.

278
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:41,100
I was in urgent need ofmoney.

279
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:41,636
Oh..No..Sister

280
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:42,636
Keep this..

281
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:44,706
I am getting Iate „Let me go.

282
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:52,105
Daughter said, she is not
allowed to put on Iights after10PM.

283
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:56,947
She gets hardly gets any
time to study after reaching here at 7.

284
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:02,284
One of my relatives has
a hostel just across the road.

285
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,288
There you can put on Iights, 24 hrs.

286
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:07,195
Can charge Computer and phone.

287
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,295
Only two persons in one room.

288
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,333
They give milk, chicken and eggs for food.

289
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:15,295
7000 rupees per month is the rent.

290
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:16,963
Shall wejoin herthere?

291
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:20,499
This is a govt. Hostel.

292
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:21,739
It can be run this way only.

293
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:37,554
Ewgmmüm im

294
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:39,559
Paid the fees,
Papa.

295
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:46,252
At noon, as I was feeding the cow,

296
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,488
a rat snake appeared nearthe hen-coop.

297
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:48,220
Then?

298
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,422
Must have come to eat something

299
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,325
I shooed it away..

300
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:04,112
Eat some more..
This is enough.

301
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,712
There were six or seven ripe bread fruits.

302
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:09,674
I have kept it in the front-yard.

303
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:12,850
Do you have a beed i?

304
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:14,087
Didn't you quit smoking?

305
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:15,156
Still... can smoke at times.

306
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:16,456
Do you have?

307
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:25,529
Here..Take only one.

308
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,401
Ok...Let me go.
I will come in the morning.

309
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,278
That warden is an arrogant guy.

310
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:44,677
I wanted to ask her ifthis was the way
to behave to inmates of a govt. Run hostel

311
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:49,855
I thought she might get
angry at you forthat.

312
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:51,852
That was good.

313
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:57,189
We can't improve the country
all by ourselves, Mama.

314
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:58,632
0k..Leave it.

315
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:00,497
What did you cook for dinner?

316
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:05,169
Made some cereal porridge.

317
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,304
Chutney too.

318
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:07,609
Good.

319
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:11,180
You have the same old Dosa and
stale sam bar for breakfast..ls it?

320
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:13,174
Aslight change.

321
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:15,775
Instead of dosa, we have idly today.

322
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:17,412
Mama.

323
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:19,287
If you had not paid fees,

324
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:20,818
I wouldn't have got that too.

325
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:23,552
You didn't inform me earlier that
the Iaws were made strict

326
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:26,659
I was thinking there's
time till the end ofthe month.

327
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:32,528
Why don't you come here
at least on Sundays?

328
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,268
You can eat delicious food
at least once in a while.

329
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:40,237
Can't travel two hours in bus.. Mama.

330
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:45,207
Myself and your grandpa
travel in the same bus everyday

331
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,542
I am not that old.

332
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:52,946
Can' travel in buses and boats
in this age ..my dear child.

333
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:59,455
Finden

334
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:04,465
Then it became Saturdays, Sundays and
then once in two weeks..

335
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:06,862
Now, you haven't come here
since one and a half months.

336
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:11,405
Leave me..Your grand pa
would Iove to meet you.

337
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,876
So that is the point.

338
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:18,576
Not to give me delicious food.

339
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:21,917
Missing you so much, dear.

340
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,583
At times, feel that
I should not haue sent you to the hostel.

341
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,556
If you don't come here,

342
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:32,926
I will come there this Sunday.

343
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:35,629
I want to spend a Iot oftime with you.

344
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:39,025
Don't come without informing.

345
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:43,264
I may have special classes on Sundays.

346
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:46,036
Mama You have dinner and go to sleep.

347
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:47,874
I will call you.

348
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:49,242
Bye.

349
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:22,671
Keep this..

350
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:27,013
No Sir.I had an urgency that day...

351
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:28,615
Now it is over.

352
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:30,508
You will have such urgencies again..

353
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,885
I will ask then, sir.

354
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:39,325
If you have any urgency
even when I am not here,

355
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,723
...the security has the key

356
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:42,393
open the door

357
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,495
always there is some cash in the drawers.

358
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,101
Take it..You understand?

359
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,532
Not that way, sir.

360
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:53,507
You are paying me for my work here.

361
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:55,935
That too sometimes even
before the month end

362
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:59,915
I have freedom to ask for Ioans.

363
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:04,116
That itself is a great relief for
someone Iike me, sir.

364
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,455
And what happens to my "relief" for Iunch?

365
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:09,453
Over sir.

366
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,519

00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,124

368
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:17,766
MJÜ„

369
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:19,995

370
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,667
Is it a holiday foryou

371
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,029

I camejust because you called me yesterday

374
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:56,368
I didn't see your shield.

375
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:59,702
Not an award.it was an honouring.

376
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:06,179
Got a Iarge kathakali statuette
and a useless golden shawl.

377
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:09,713
The cash award was a cheq ue.

378
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:11,152
After the programme,

379
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:16,616

That is my pleasure.

386
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,749
The founh day after your thread ceremony

387
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:21,453
...your father Ieft saying that
his Ieave period was over.

388
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:27,093
After a week, some officers came

And came out of your father's household.

396

Afterthat, wheneverl have difficulties

00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,153
Always this face of my darling wakes me up.

00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,873
I don't have to bother
about time and place to kiss my daughter.

401
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:48,875
Yes..You have to ..

402
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:53,079
Some kissing protesters
might get hold of us.

403
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:59,653
Why are you ruminating
over past things today?

404
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:02,581
These are symptoms of old age

405
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,550
I will get old only after you
pass out with good marks

406
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:10,564

working independently.

Is my father here?

412
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:34,179
I had called you

413
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:36,942
I called back a number oftimes.

414
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,076
Your father had a chest pain.

415
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:38,676
0h..IVIy God!!

416
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:40,311
He was taken to the hospital

417
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:42,888
he is admitted there.

418
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:43,855
When?

419
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:45,750
At about 4 or 4.30.

420
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,293
He was Iying on the floor near the well.

421
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,687
Which hospital?

422
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:50,865
The General hospital.

423
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:52,233
Is there anyone with him?

424
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:53,265
I don't know.

425
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:55,428
He was taken in ourjeep.

426
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:12,919
It was a severe attack.

427
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:14,285
But nothing to worry.

428
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:15,981
He will be stable by tomorrow morning.

429
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:20,357
Will have to be here fortwo or three days.

430
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:22,494
WM [ma@„

431
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,727
Isn't he old? May be having cholesterol.

432
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:26,433
Let us see the test results.

433
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:30,304
He had gone to a free medical test in
a medical camp some years back.

434
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:33,841
The doctor, there,
said he has a Iittle cholesterol.

435
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:35,940
He had warned that if he did not
take medicines this might happen.

436
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:38,505
He was taking medicines reg ularly,
Sir.

437
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,507
Then how could this happen?

438
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:42,974
We can do an investigation and
find out the reason.

439
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,778
You go and meet the sister and
meet your father.

440
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:03,394
You got scared?

441
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:07,236
I asked the doctor.

442
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:09,344
A minor attack. That is all.

443
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:11,938
Can go home in a couple of days.

444
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:14,845
Acouple of days?

445
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:16,415
That won't do..

446
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:18,012
We will go home today itself.

447
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:19,483
No..Not possible.

448
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:21,517
You have to take rest.

449
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:23,391
OthenNiSe you will have more pain

450
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:24,857
I have no pain now.

451
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,924
Why should I Iie herejust Iike that?

452
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,524
I can take medicines at home also.

453
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:31,063
Can't do all these at home.

454
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:33,494
It is a matter ofjust a couple of days.

455
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:39,969
You have to purchase a
towel, toothbrush, paste..

456
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,541
Then. Rice gruel for dinner.

457
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:42,840
Idlies for breakfast.

458
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:45,144
Bring the old X-Ray and ECG repon
if you have it with you.

459
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:48,949
Don't Iet him speak too much.

460
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:49,880
You can go.

461
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:54,078
What will you do for cash?

462
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:56,357
This is a govt. Hospital.

463
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:58,521
Everything is free here.

464
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:00,259
Gruel and idlis..

465
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,354
We need it at home too.

466
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:03,896
You don't bother ..

467
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:16,339
Hot gruel...

468
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:22,981

00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:47,399
I didn't knowthat you do such a job too.

476
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:50,207
To tell you the truth, this is a trick.

477
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:52,607
It gives me food forjust one time.

478
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,951
But I can sleep on the hospital Veranda.

479
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,511

Will be shifted to the ward in the
afternoon. That is what they said.

484
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:15,293
It is not Iike olden times.

485
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:17,199
Now it is quite neat and clean
betterthan private hospitals.

486
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:22,408
OthenNiSe everything is ok..

487
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:25,906

492
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:37,256
Have to take some more tests.

493
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:39,250
The sister will give you the samples.

494
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:40,686
Take it to some Iab
outside and get results.

495
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:42,455
Show me the results.

496
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:45,531
After that, we can decide if
he requires an angiogram.

497
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:47,227
Is he better now, Doctor?

498
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,199
Even a fever takes three four days.

499
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:50,969
You get me the test results.

500
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:51,601

No..We don't have the facilities.

503
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:58,471
Howmuch it will cost?

504
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:01,611
May be around two thousand bucks.

505
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,041
Two thousand?!

506
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:05,208
Don't get tensed, Sister.

507
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:07,980
If you want cash I will
get it from the ATM.

508
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:16,657
Where is the Heart wing?

509

00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:53,758
Doctor, Isn't he ok?

517
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:56,560
He was not Ok. But now
we have made him better.

518
00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:59,307
After getting the test results
we can shift him to the ward.

519
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:00,232
Don't worry.

520
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:01,639

At night, I waited at the road junction
to see ifl could get a jeep.

00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:53,657
Got the bus in the morning only.

Give him a mixture of ginger and garlic.

538
00:50:58,822 --> 00:50:59,425
He will get better soon.

539
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:00,631
I have brought it.

540
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,202
This is notthaLSome
problem with his hean.

541
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,333
That is it. lt is due to gas.

542
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:10,477
Our old watcher at the pump house,
Sivan chettan, died ofthis disease.

543
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:12,111
Poor gUV"

544
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:13,613
He should have been given this concoction.

545
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:16,049
Shall I go to office?

546
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:17,778
Can you be here till evening?

547
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:21,119
Of course. On discharge we will go together

548
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:22,589
I don't need money.

549
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:23,689
Where is he Iying?

550
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:25,292
Wait outside.

551
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:26,789
They will call you if required.

552
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,394
Ok..You can go.

553
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:36,369
Sir.

554
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,241
Your papa has become smart now..Is it?

555
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:41,371
Sit down

556
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:45,511
I had told him to go hometoday evening.

557
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:49,480
Have to take medicines on time.

558
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:53,445
Can walk for five minutes
in the morning and evening.

559
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:57,653
Add one minute everyday
till twenty minutes.

560
00:51:58,415 --> 00:51:59,689
So he can't go forwork?

561
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:00,591
No..

562
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:02,159
Can't go for work.

563
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:03,891
Can't carry heavy Ioads.

564
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:05,631
Don't do any work bending down.

565
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:08,097
Shouldn't travel in bus or autorikshaws.

566
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:09,261
He needs good rest.

567
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:10,464
Actually,

568
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:11,502
He needs a bypass surgery.

569
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:13,606
But that is risky at this age.

570
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:16,506
Can go on with these medicines.

571
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:20,248
Come forthe check up on
the prescribed date..0k?

572
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:27,685
After two weeks,

00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,917
take these blood tests and
showme the results in 0P.

574
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:35,158
Can do it somewhere nearyour home.
That won't cost much.

575
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:35,625
Ok.

576
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:37,458
Are you employed?

577
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:38,389
Yes sir.

578
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,630
So you will have to take Ieave ..Is it?

579
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:42,770
Do one thing.

580
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:46,133
You show me the results
at my home on Sunday.

581
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:47,738
Patient need not come.

582
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:49,499
Just showme the results.

583
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:51,470

You were of great help sir.

585
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:57,351
0h..Don't bother.

586
00:52:57,774 --> 00:52:58,844
When you come with the results,

587
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:00,879
I will give you some sample medicines.

588
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:01,679
0k..Go ahead.

589
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:28,373
Where are you going, Papa?

590
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:30,850
Dear, Shall I accompany you?

591
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:33,649
Why Papa?

592
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:35,846
Didn't you agree yesterday?

593
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:39,455
What you need now is rest,
That is what the doctor said.

594
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:42,964
Please wait at least till
the next check-up, Papa.

595
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:47,694
And ifthe doctor permits,
you can go for work.

596
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:50,532
I haue no problems now.
Dear

597
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,306
I won't do heavy work there..

598
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:56,539
Why should we lose Rs 3500 a month?

599
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,743
Money is not that imponant but health
and duration of Iife are imponant.

600
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,983
Those things don't depend on us.

601
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:06,479
When time comes one has to go..
That is it.

602
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:10,622
So you wish to go Iike that?

603
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:12,883
Then who else do we have?

604
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:25,771
Muahnfilm

605
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:28,706
...we will try to get ajob
that is not that heavy.

606
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:31,368
I will enquire in the
shop at the road junction.

607
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,603
Then you won't have to travel much also.

608
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:36,283
From where can we get
a job that needs no exertion?

609
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:39,009
Will get it..if not..just forget about it.

610
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:42,319
I am going to MN sir's thrice a week.

611
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:45,319
M5
Ei}

612
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:49,329
Don't worry about such things Papa.

613
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:52,524
You take medicines and take rest at home.

614
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:54,559
My dear..I will also..

615
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:59,064
If you Iove me listen

Let me Ieave.

617

Take care of him.

618
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:23,594
You go ahead I will take care.

619
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:24,797
Come...

620
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:34,968
Come, Mariyamma.

621
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:36,442

00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:03,896
Good morning.

624
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:07,499
Our Renjini delivered..

625
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,636
Not this Ranjini .0ur daughter in London.

626
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:12,442
Baby boy or girl?

627
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:14,479
Girl ..a beautiful baby girl.

628
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:20,484
When both ofthem go to the hospital ..
Someone has to be there to babysit.

629
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:24,585
So we decided to go there.

630
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:26,687
Will take a year to return.

631
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,657
So you won't need milk..Is it?

632
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:34,168
I need milk. Punctually

633
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:37,801
I am giving charge ofthe house
to an old Iady, a relative too.

634

You come here everyday.

635
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,974
Just take care of Ranjan and Ranjini.

636
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,603
You should see if they are fed properly.

637
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:50,142
She is an innocent Iady..But stilll!

638
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:51,844

Come We will sit inside..

644
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:05,892
Sit down.

645
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,094
Will you have some coffee?

646
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:09,255
No Sir.

647
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:10,797
EIS'
mm

648
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,523
Wife is on a company tour.

649
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,268
Everything is under control.

650
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,941
Diets and medicines remain the same.

651
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,700
He is walking for twenty
minutes a day Is it?

652
00:58:22,899 --> 00:58:23,570
Yes sir.

653
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:24,604

654
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:25,943
No sir.

655
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,276
Come and sit here.

656
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:38,916
You are a Iittle anemic.

657
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,055
Don't you eat food properly?

658
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:41,695
Yes.

659
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,027
Keep your hands here.

660
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:52,128
Where do you work?

661
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:53,232
In Freetalks.

662
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:55,503
That is stressful Isn't it?

663
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:05,309
BP is normal.

664
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:11,053
Do you get stomachache,
headache or breathlessness any time?

665
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:12,553
No Sir.

666
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:16,222
Just Iie down on that table.

667
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:19,894
Why sir?I have no problems.

668
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:21,067
May be.

669
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:22,696
But isn't it me to tell you that?

670
00:59:22,926 --> 00:59:24,633
Lie down..Let me see.

671
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:49,058
Lie down.

672
00:59:58,394 --> 00:59:59,338
Take a breath.

673
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:08,246
Any pain here?

674
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:09,145
No.

675
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:11,242
Here?

676
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:11,942
No.

677
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:13,279
Do you get regular periods?

678
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:15,321
Yes.

679
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:19,089
Your body is very cold.

680
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:20,393
You ..Bastard..

681
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:21,988
He says I am anemic!!

682
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:25,589
The nerves of yours that break...
on seeing girlsl!

683
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:31,263
Better you get medicines
for those fickle nerves of yours.

684
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:35,870
Everyone will be informed about
this sample medicines trick of yours..

685
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:37,737
H is testsl!

686
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:45,847
What happened?

687
01:00:46,342 --> 01:00:48,686
I came to the city for some work.

688
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:05,296
Going out of mood to write..
Thought I will have a peg,

689
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:58,050
Have a cup of hot coffee.

690
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:15,702
Did you go to the doctor's house
to show him the results?

691
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:21,910
Leave it.

692
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:26,043
Such unsuccessful attacks
make us become aware.

693
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:29,049
That will prompt us to be more careful

694
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:43,162
I know only a Iittle about you.

695
01:02:43,893 --> 01:02:50,105
A
sfiwflm

696
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:55,778
lt is common here to get
married twice or thrice.

697
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,110
It is easy too.

698
01:02:57,974 --> 01:03:02,116
Did you ever feel that you need a protection
even after incidents Iike today's?

699
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:03,188
No.

700
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:06,256
Then, the Iack of protection
that you talk about..

701
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:09,023
Amnfldmm
{Emmmmh}

mflstulmdtä
fimflmflx

703
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:25,436
a Woman's body is made for his pleasure.

704
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:28,481
That is the reason for
all these attacks, Sir.

705
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:34,448
Not because a woman walks
alone or has no husband.

706
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:35,516
Ok..

707
01:03:36,512 --> 01:03:38,958
Protection is not a problem.

708
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:43,127
But have your body felt the need any time?

709
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:44,556
Not even once?

710
01:03:45,087 --> 01:03:45,895
No ..

711
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:49,993
Does one feel Iike that?

712
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:53,030
I haven't

713
01:03:56,032 --> 01:03:58,103
I have read somewhere.

714
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:02,471
How can Iust blossom in hopelessness?

715
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,953
There is no biological reason forthat.

716
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:10,980
But it is a peculiarity only forwomen.

717
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,888
Don't have that feeling
of Iust even inside.

718
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:16,356
Not in general.. but in some women.

719
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:19,462
Maybe it makes them more powerful.

720
01:04:19,922 --> 01:04:22,960
Sir..You are talking things which
I don't understand.

721
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:29,942
Wheneverl am awake.. my thoughts are
all of my daughter and my father.

722
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:36,479
Their requirements, hunger,
food they Iike, medicines,

723
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:38,346
...my daughter's studies,

724
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:43,414
...her getting a good job,
her happinesss... Iike that.

725
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:47,992
Even in my dreams, that is all I have, sir.

726
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:50,258
Good..

727
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:54,995
You need some hopes to Iead you in Iife.

728
01:04:55,691 --> 01:04:57,398
You have that.

729
01:04:57,994 --> 01:04:59,337
Yes..Sir.

730
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:01,971
The hope ..my daughter.

731
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:09,211
Nly Iife is dedicated for her.

732
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:24,021
Especially, when Iiterature and an are being
valued on the basis of marketingnow a days,

733
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:28,500
As a publisher, you may feel
that these experiences that

734
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:32,266
you heard now... are not apt
to be made into a story;

735
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:37,441
The style oftelling a story based onjust
an incident had changed even in the past.

736
01:05:38,401 --> 01:05:41,075
Scattered experiences of an individual...

737
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:46,411
I don't think there will be any shon
comings when it is made into a book.

738
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:48,655
Ifthat is the thought

739
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:52,282
the society that she represents
is also having a Iot of shoncomings.

740
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:54,017
...that is my answer.

741
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:56,125
Ok..MN Follow her Iife.

742
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:58,456
We will publish it.

743
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:02,967
Not a mere hand shake will do...

744
01:06:03,426 --> 01:06:06,202
Need something that gives me energy.

745
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:09,509
Oh..I have it ready in my pocket.

746
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:10,267
Thank you.

747
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:10,670
Ok.

748
01:06:57,246 --> 01:06:58,987
Hello..

749
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:01,089
Dina is in chapel.

750
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:02,619
Oh..

751
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:05,331
Just be there.

752
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:08,232
We will reach there in half an hour..

753
01:07:08,624 --> 01:07:09,398
Ok.

754
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:30,255
What happened?

755
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:33,751
Looks Iike she has a Iot to confess.

756
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:37,262
Since quite a Iong timel!

757
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:47,298
Asked Akhil to wait wait in Kawadiar.

758
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:49,100
0k..We will go that way
But she has to come out

759
01:07:49,498 --> 01:07:50,203
Dina..

760
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:52,341
Hi Sudhi.

761
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:53,208
Hi Dina.. Come.

762
01:07:56,172 --> 01:07:57,378
Charu..How will I change?

763
01:07:57,873 --> 01:07:59,284
We will get in the car and change.

764
01:07:59,475 --> 01:08:00,112
0k Get in.

765
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:18,434
We are waiting here.

766
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:20,663
In the restaurant.

767
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:22,401
Ok..

768
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:23,166
Please.

769
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:26,742
She is a half malayali.

770
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:28,479
Born and brought up in Canada.

771
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:32,084
PRO to an NGO initiative there.

772
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:33,116
That means,

773
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:36,447
Through Iiteracy promotions
and rural development initiatives..

774
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:41,219
They increase the standard of Iiving of
the rural folk in Canada...

775
01:08:41,684 --> 01:08:44,597
Make townships in
not so densely populated regions

776
01:08:45,387 --> 01:08:47,731
...and make people migrate
gradually to the townships.

777
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:49,465
These are their programmes...

778
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:53,265
The hidden agenda is to boost
the parent companies' business.

779
01:08:56,198 --> 01:08:56,608
Sudhi.

780
01:09:22,358 --> 01:09:26,465
Only couples can migrate
in this scheme Is it?

781
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:37,782
Last time,
there was a domestic migration program.

782
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:40,786
To migrate people Iiving in other
places in Canada,

783
01:09:41,377 --> 01:09:46,258
to this place..
We tried doing that.

784
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:50,792
But none of them were ready to Ieave
their present Iiving atmosphere ..

785
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:01,504
Any other preparations required?

786
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:02,435
Not much..

787
01:10:03,966 --> 01:10:06,845
The selected couples
will have to go through one week training.

788
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,889
Is it enough that one in the couple passes
the English Ianguage test?

789
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:43,344
They said there will be
a processing charge.

790
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:45,644
How much will be that?

791
01:10:46,308 --> 01:10:48,686
10 Iakhs Indian rupees for each couple.

792
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:51,580
We will fund the balance amount.

793
01:10:57,519 --> 01:10:59,556
As you are funded immigrants,

794
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:02,328
you cannot Ieave canada for
the next 14 years.

795
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:15,542
Today we are applying.

796
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:17,540
Since we have paid enough bribe,

797
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:20,886
we will get it in two or three days.

798
01:11:24,847 --> 01:11:29,887
Nly parents' business flopped.
They are facing coun cases now.

799
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:34,795
Ifl stay here morel may also
have to appear in the coun as legal heir.

800
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:38,832
I Iove her so much.

801
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:41,306
We need a good Iife.

802
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:55,515
Can't do it here at home.

803
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:59,548
Family, relatives and even
religion may hun us.

804
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:00,854
So we have no other go.

805
01:12:12,094 --> 01:12:12,697
Charu,

806
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:15,734
Did you tell your mother about the cash?

807
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:17,708
Tell her that you got a
scholarship to study there.

808
01:12:17,933 --> 01:12:19,071
Just for a year ortwo.

809
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:32,957
Her mother Ioves her so much.

810
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:35,823
Isn't it the same with all of us?

811
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:39,992
Charu..

812
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:40,958
Cheer up..

813
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:43,798
There is no other option.

814
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:46,338
You know how much I
struggled to make 4 Iakhs.

815
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:48,334
I know...

816
01:12:49,732 --> 01:12:50,437
But...

817
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:53,470
Please.

818
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:00,582
Take it..

819
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:08,388
Very tasty?

820
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:09,559
Is it the honey jackfruit, uncle?

821
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:12,364
No..it is tastierthan this.

822
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:19,135
If you eat jackfruits continuously for four
months in a year you will not get diabetes.

823
01:13:19,461 --> 01:13:20,439
Same with cancer.

824
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:21,130
True?

825
01:13:21,864 --> 01:13:23,605
Why doubt?

826
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:30,883
Fony years ago
we had almost no diabetics around.

827
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:34,721
Look at me...I am above 70.

828
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:38,085
When I was admitted in hospital last time

829
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,189
„tests were done many times and
there is not even a hint of diabetes.

830
01:13:40,482 --> 01:13:42,155
But you had a hean attack!

831
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:49,094
That was because I had to take
so many tablets in the medical camps.

832
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,699
Just for the doctors to make money.

833
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:52,469
AnyWaV»

834
01:13:52,628 --> 01:13:55,074
Anyway, I will take seeds of these
jackfruits when I go to Canada.

835
01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:56,943
Won'tjackfruits grow
in cold climate, uncle?

836
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:59,110
Not jackfruits but...jackfruit trees.

837
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:03,113
Whatever grows here at our home,
won't grow anywhere else.

838
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:06,209
Is there any other place
as beautiful as ours?

839
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:11,714
Isn't it enough to study in colleges here?

840
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:15,723
Even othenuise,

841
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:17,961
what son of studies you
will get in Canada that you don't get here.

842
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:22,196
You won't understand all those.

843
01:14:27,763 --> 01:14:30,141
It was foolish of me to admit you in
the hostel for studies.

844
01:14:30,933 --> 01:14:33,038
Some hopes these rich guys have!!

845
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:35,577
Big mouthfuls often choke, Charu.

846
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:40,584
Then...To avoid chokes,
we can struggle Iike this forever..

847
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:43,055
Try this..supertaste

848
01:14:43,712 --> 01:14:44,213
I don't want.

849
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:46,785
What happened?

850
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:52,755
Pack my things at the hostel.

851
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:55,533
Mama will come and collect it.

852
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:58,528
I am not coming to
the college or hostel any more.

853
01:15:01,597 --> 01:15:03,941
You call me when you go, afterfood.

854
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:05,940
I have a headache. Let me sleep for awhile.

855
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:17,557
Charu's mother..

856
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:22,756
Don't take this as a silly wish of Charu.

If we don't utilize it,
God may not be that kind always...

859
01:15:32,961 --> 01:15:36,738
For a family Iike yours
this is a great fonune.

860
01:15:37,566 --> 01:15:40,843
If you wish your child
to have a great future...

861
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:42,911
you should Iet her go to Canada.

862
01:15:50,112 --> 01:15:53,582
You don't have to pay any fees
there is scholarship also.

Sfifißhfiähflfixm,

864
01:15:56,818 --> 01:15:59,162
she may be able to
send some cash home also.

865
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:02,535
She doesn't have to do that.

866
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:05,132
She should be happy there and study well.

867
01:16:07,696 --> 01:16:10,836
But..
How can she be there alone and so far...?!

868

maflayaflfis Uflwflmg]

869
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:23,951
Some girls go there after
paying 25 to 30 Iakhs.

870
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:28,219
Since we passed this test,
we have to pay much Iess.

871
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:31,187
It is only because of her Iuck.

872
01:16:31,853 --> 01:16:36,324
Mm
m

873
01:16:37,392 --> 01:16:38,928
Charu didn't tell you?

874
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:40,005
No.

875
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:42,336
You will have to give 6 Iakhs.

876
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:49,378
That can be recouped in
just a couple of years.

877
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:11,096
I think it is a good proposal, sister.

878
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:15,831
Not only that she can study but she will
definitely get a placement there ..

879
01:17:16,932 --> 01:17:19,276
The salary is not Iike ours.

880
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:22,045
Her Iife will be secured in five years.

881
01:17:22,437 --> 01:17:24,747
You should change that
onhodox attitude...

882
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:26,911
that your daughter is crossing
the ocean and all that.

883
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:28,147
You know about me.

884
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,715
Only because ofthe concern daddy
has towards grandma...

885
01:17:30,946 --> 01:17:32,789
...I am hanging onto thejob here.

886
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:36,324
Daddy and Kichu are taking only
the same effons in London.

887
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:39,025
But they earn ten times more
than whatl earn here

888
01:17:39,721 --> 01:17:41,792
I feel that you should Iet her go.

889
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:47,705
But..Vini..From where can I find 6 Iakhs?

890
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:49,641
Thinking of that..

891
01:17:50,065 --> 01:17:53,205
It is not that easy for you, sister.

892
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:55,144
But, Iet us try.

893
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:58,146
Like a bank Ioan..
There will be some way out.

894
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:06,650
I don't know.
I told herl would try..

895
01:18:07,149 --> 01:18:10,460
My dearVini..it is Iike carrying
a fifty Kg weight on my head.

896
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:14,126
Don't get tensed. Go to sleep
We will talk about it tomorrow.

897
01:18:14,322 --> 01:18:15,858
Ok Vini.

898
01:18:22,898 --> 01:18:25,208
Can we make that son of money..Dear?

899
01:18:37,045 --> 01:18:39,355
At times, Iife is also Iike that.

900
01:18:39,815 --> 01:18:43,262
It takes us to unthinkable
and horrible situations.

901
01:18:43,452 --> 01:18:47,798
We would be shocked..howto face itl!
We might even retreat.

902
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:52,730
But if one decides to face it and
gets ready to do anything for it...

903
01:18:52,994 --> 01:18:56,737
You can send your daughter not to Canada
but even to Mars..

904
01:18:57,099 --> 01:18:59,511
Be courageous and go ahead.

905
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:03,008
Take this.

906
01:19:03,472 --> 01:19:04,041
Sir.

907
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:08,748
It is 35000 rupees.

908
01:19:09,544 --> 01:19:12,081
I have only this much now.

909
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,851
Iwill try ifl can manage more.

910
01:19:18,854 --> 01:19:23,325
The present rules don't provide for
an education Ioan for studies abroad.

911
01:19:23,859 --> 01:19:26,237
Then, do you have any Ianded propeny?

912
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:30,005
Then we can arrange a mongage Ioan.

913
01:19:30,332 --> 01:19:32,278
Still, there is a problem.

914
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:34,241
Your repayment capacity.

915
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:36,107
What is your salary?

916
01:19:36,571 --> 01:19:38,016
6700

917
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:41,018
I will stand as a guarantee too.

918
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:42,853
Ok..Let us see.

919
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:46,754
What this branch can do is
Rs. 3 Iakhs at the most.

920
01:19:47,516 --> 01:19:50,326
Let me see the documents of your propeny.

921
01:19:50,418 --> 01:19:50,919
Ok Sir.

922
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:51,290
Ok.

923
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:51,931
Thanks.

924
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:32,533
No cantankerous woman Iike your mother
would have taken binh on eanh.

925
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:39,342
Your daug hter has inherited her character.

926
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,553
You used to draw pictures well.

927
01:20:55,116 --> 01:20:58,393
This was just a one room
tenement those days.

928
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:01,901
You used to show me this
drawing and tell me,

929
01:21:02,224 --> 01:21:04,500
ÄüPapa Iet us make a house Iike this'.

930
01:21:04,993 --> 01:21:09,601
That Ionging was fulfilled
after so many years.

931
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:11,500
That too step by step.

932
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:17,474
By that time you grew old.
You quit drawing.

933
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:21,018
If you hadn't drawn this,

934
01:21:21,309 --> 01:21:25,314
we would not be having this
house to hypothecate now.

935
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:30,523
Ifl knewthis then,
I would have drawn a two storied house.

936
01:21:30,685 --> 01:21:33,427
I think it is in that.

937
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:47,446
Yes..This is the one.

938
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:51,976
Nayanar was the Chief
Minister at that time.

939
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:58,081
Your mother and I went to the meeting in
the road junction to get the papers.

940
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:03,261
When your mother prostrated
in front, he raised her up

941
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:07,389
...and said that soon
he would arrange money for the house also.

942
01:22:07,722 --> 01:22:09,395
That was also given aftenNards.

943
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:10,999
Through the panchayath.

944
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:14,931
She used to pay the taxes
punctually till she Ieft.

945
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:18,206
Now, there must be arrears.

946
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:27,477
This is not enough.

947
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:30,985
The original document.

948
01:22:32,647 --> 01:22:34,524
And the document before that...

949
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:37,421
No encumbrance cenificate,

950
01:22:37,686 --> 01:22:42,635
heir ship cenificate
and Iocation sketch too.

951
01:22:43,758 --> 01:22:46,102
We need all these papers.

952
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:48,607
You can get these from the village office.

953
01:22:56,604 --> 01:22:57,105
Hello

954
01:22:58,039 --> 01:22:58,574
I am here

955
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:00,044
I sawyou.

956
01:23:00,241 --> 01:23:01,049
Look here...

957
01:23:01,509 --> 01:23:02,510
Towards the ATM.

958
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:04,720
Did you see?

959
01:23:05,013 --> 01:23:05,354
Yes.

960
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:06,157
Ok Ok

961
01:23:06,614 --> 01:23:07,524
I will come there.

962
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:15,662
Why? Gopalaettan's daughter
is going to buy a house?

963
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:17,361
No..Member.

964
01:23:18,526 --> 01:23:21,473
We have to get all these papers for
our house immediately.

965
01:23:21,696 --> 01:23:23,403
For a Ioan?

966
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:27,179
We have only all these papers.

967
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:37,051
What can we do with this?

968
01:23:43,284 --> 01:23:45,161
This is the title deed awarded by the Govt.

969
01:23:45,653 --> 01:23:47,530
Not of much imponance.

970
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:50,000
Not only that,
your mother is not alive.

971
01:23:50,558 --> 01:23:54,096
<i>°°:,"„"::";:322:;':„*':e::::::':i;:r:°""</i>

972
01:23:54,662 --> 01:23:56,642
Then how can we get
all the documents noted here?

973
01:23:56,831 --> 01:23:58,742
Member... If you can help..

974
01:23:59,768 --> 01:24:00,746
No way ..Child.

975
01:24:01,302 --> 01:24:05,182
It is easierto become the Prime Minister of India
than to make proper documents for this property.

976
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:08,449
Not only that..if someone
complains about this,

977
01:24:08,643 --> 01:24:10,486
the Iand itself may disappear.

978
01:24:10,678 --> 01:24:11,782
How is it?

979
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:14,285
We are staying there since so many years.

980
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:15,690
Yes..That is whatl am talking about.

981
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:20,393
You just stayed there without doing things
that should have been done from time to time.

982
01:24:20,655 --> 01:24:24,569
You have to remind that you are staying in the
Iand, that has a title deed given by govt.

983
01:24:25,193 --> 01:24:28,606
...Paying taxes, and the Iand
area is so much in the resurvey.

984
01:24:28,797 --> 01:24:29,332
Rem ind whom?

985
01:24:29,631 --> 01:24:30,609
The government.

986
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:32,271
Othenmse,

987
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,141
such a Iand would not even exist
in the official documents.

988
01:24:34,402 --> 01:24:35,073
That is the problem..

989
01:24:35,236 --> 01:24:37,045
How can a Iand which is
there just disappear, Sir?

990
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:38,774
Don't call me sir.

991
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:40,278
You can call me Dilipetta.

992
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:43,153
Take it as an advice ..

993
01:24:43,678 --> 01:24:46,488
If possible sell the Iand
to some rich guy and secure yourself.

994
01:24:46,881 --> 01:24:47,552
That is safe.

995
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:53,824
Rich people will make some resorts and
gradually make the documents proper ..

996
01:24:54,355 --> 01:24:56,596
If we go behind this, it
will take at least 10 years.

997
01:24:57,225 --> 01:24:57,726
I am sure.

998
01:25:08,803 --> 01:25:09,611
Sister..

999
01:25:09,904 --> 01:25:10,780
Sister..Drink this.

1000
01:25:17,712 --> 01:25:18,622
Who is that, Sister?

1001
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:19,817
Nly daughter.

1002
01:25:20,181 --> 01:25:20,659
Pick it.

1003
01:25:25,553 --> 01:25:26,224
Dear...

1004
01:25:26,654 --> 01:25:27,325
Mam a..

1005
01:25:27,755 --> 01:25:29,496
I am coming from the passpon office.

1006
01:25:30,525 --> 01:25:32,198
Things are ok there

1007
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:33,799
I will get it the day aftertomorrow.

1008
01:25:34,395 --> 01:25:36,636
Didn't you have to pay forthe passpon?

1009
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:41,313
Nly friends helped me for the time being.

1010
01:25:42,504 --> 01:25:44,677
We applied in the addressof Harsha.

1011
01:25:45,473 --> 01:25:47,146
They paid it all together.

1012
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:50,519
How are things, Mama

1013
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:54,423
I am trying my best.

1014
01:25:55,783 --> 01:25:58,229
Fifteenth is nearing Mama.

1015
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:00,188
Others are all ready with cash.

1016
01:26:00,855 --> 01:26:02,664
They are all waiting for me.

1017
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:06,803
I am trying Charu.

1018
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:09,532
Nothing can Substitute money.

1019
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,711
I will call you.
Have you reached the hostel?

1020
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:16,240
Almost.

1021
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:16,914
Ok.

1022
01:26:19,774 --> 01:26:20,752
Will your mom cheat...?

1023
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:22,813
Sudhi...

1024
01:26:25,446 --> 01:26:28,450
Your mom and dad are into some problems and
my mother is struggling now!!

1025
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:30,458
I said something due to my tension...

1026
01:26:32,287 --> 01:26:33,265
Tension..Everyone has that.

1027
01:26:34,789 --> 01:26:35,961
I am reeling under afeeling ofguilt.

1028
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:39,368
So, what about me who is Ieaving
my parents in such a pathetic state?

1029
01:26:39,794 --> 01:26:42,365
I wish for a Iife with you Charu..

1030
01:26:43,231 --> 01:26:44,767
That is my reason too..

1031
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:48,203
I don't Iike you blaming my mother.

1032
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:48,938
Sorry.

1033
01:26:51,005 --> 01:26:51,915
Sorry..

1034
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:53,280
You go..

1035
01:26:53,641 --> 01:26:54,847
I have to go to the hostel

1036
01:27:04,419 --> 01:27:06,296
I tried talking to daddy.

1037
01:27:06,821 --> 01:27:10,200
But there is some problem there Iike
status change or something Iike that.

1038
01:27:10,491 --> 01:27:13,529
No bank transactions
will take place fortwo, three months.

1039
01:27:14,529 --> 01:27:19,478
He told me he would transfer
some amount tomorrow by moneygram.

1040
01:27:19,634 --> 01:27:21,477
Did he ask the details Iike forwhom etc.?

1041
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:23,611
I told him it is for a friend.

1042
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:26,481
Twenty five thousand mig ht come.

1043
01:27:27,408 --> 01:27:30,218
Adding that with money in my account

1044
01:27:30,445 --> 01:27:31,753
it Will be 50000

1045
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:34,291
I have to get money from some homes.

1046
01:27:34,482 --> 01:27:35,290
For milk.

1047
01:27:35,883 --> 01:27:39,023
If we add all that with the money
from MN sir also,

1048
01:27:39,454 --> 01:27:42,298
it will be around 100000 only.

1049
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:44,792
You have one Iakh from nothing.

1050
01:27:45,426 --> 01:27:46,962
Another five Iakhs..

1051
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:51,310
Bank Ioan won't come through.

1052
01:27:51,599 --> 01:27:52,907
Shall we borrow from a moneylenders?

1053
01:27:54,602 --> 01:27:56,047
For high interests?

1054
01:27:56,571 --> 01:27:58,710
Who will give so much money, Vinitha.

1055
01:27:58,973 --> 01:28:00,247
Let us try..

1056
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:02,610
Let us try..l know a person.

1057
01:28:03,311 --> 01:28:04,949
You don't mind getting a bit Iate, No?

1058
01:28:05,747 --> 01:28:07,283
Oh..There is still time for the bus.

1059
01:28:07,482 --> 01:28:08,358
Then, com e.

1060
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:31,784
Akbar Bhai...?

1061
01:28:31,939 --> 01:28:32,974
He went to the mosque. Will be right back.

1062
01:28:33,107 --> 01:28:34,984
Sit down.

1063
01:28:45,053 --> 01:28:46,088
Have you been waiting since Iong?

1064
01:28:48,056 --> 01:28:50,058
No..Akbar Bhai..Just ten mins.

1065
01:28:56,431 --> 01:28:59,412
Do you still read Arabic books regularly.

1066
01:28:59,801 --> 01:29:01,940
Have lost touch with the Iangauge.

1067
01:29:02,036 --> 01:29:03,310
That won't do.

1068
01:29:03,571 --> 01:29:05,414
Arabic is one superior
Ianguage in the world

1069
01:29:05,773 --> 01:29:06,808
Iike your Samskritham.

1070
01:29:07,108 --> 01:29:08,553
But you should be always in touch.

1071
01:29:08,743 --> 01:29:11,349
I have IearntArabic. Bhai was my teacher.

1072
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:13,592
He is a scholar.

1073
01:29:13,748 --> 01:29:16,422
Four post g rad uatio ns and two doctorates.

1074
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:18,023
AIIah..

1075
01:29:18,786 --> 01:29:20,629
He is above all studies.

1076
01:29:21,456 --> 01:29:23,663
What is greater than knowing Him!!

1077
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:26,935
Our interest rate is now 96 per cent.

1078
01:29:27,395 --> 01:29:28,840
Eight per month.

1079
01:29:30,898 --> 01:29:32,536
It doesn't matter.

1080
01:29:32,867 --> 01:29:37,145
We can help such poor people
who don't get Ioan from banks.

1081
01:29:37,605 --> 01:29:38,140
Isn't it?

1082
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:43,614
We don't do business with women.

1083
01:29:44,011 --> 01:29:47,549
Butl can't say 'no' to this girl..

1084
01:29:48,182 --> 01:29:51,561
You bring the documents of the Iand.

1085
01:29:51,853 --> 01:29:54,424
I can tell you howmuch I can give you,
...only after Iooking at the documents.

1086
01:29:55,022 --> 01:29:56,660
It is a Iittle away from here.

1087
01:29:56,824 --> 01:29:58,167
Around 10 to 15 Kms.

1088
01:29:58,760 --> 01:29:59,795
That doesn't matter.

1089
01:30:00,027 --> 01:30:00,903
You have a house there, No?

1090
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:02,439
Don't they live there?

1091
01:30:02,663 --> 01:30:03,073
Yes.

1092
01:30:03,531 --> 01:30:04,771
We only check that.

1093
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:09,043
Anyone who hypothecates the house
will be serious in paying backthe Ioan.

1094
01:30:09,203 --> 01:30:11,012
OthenNiSe won't the house be mine?

1095
01:30:12,473 --> 01:30:14,453
So..Let us.

1096
01:30:14,642 --> 01:30:14,949
Ok..Bye.

1097
01:30:23,184 --> 01:30:27,633
How can such believers
charge such high interest rates?

1098
01:30:27,955 --> 01:30:29,798
May be God has told him.

1099
01:30:30,558 --> 01:30:33,505
Who knows.
God may be doing the same business therel!

1100
01:30:44,172 --> 01:30:45,515
I told you..

1101
01:30:45,773 --> 01:30:47,844
Our company has no such policy.

1102
01:30:48,609 --> 01:30:50,555
Since I understood your Situation.

1103
01:30:50,878 --> 01:30:51,754
...I just asked...

1104
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:52,749
No way.,.

1105
01:30:53,548 --> 01:30:54,151
I am sorry.

1106
01:31:00,521 --> 01:31:00,896
Sir..

1107
01:31:01,556 --> 01:31:03,934
Deduct my full salary till
the Ioan is paid back.

1108
01:31:04,091 --> 01:31:05,593
Can you ask Iike that?

1109
01:31:05,726 --> 01:31:07,728
You won't understand..ls it?

1110
01:31:08,696 --> 01:31:10,937
This is an American com pany.

1111
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:12,803
Get paid according to your work.

1112
01:31:13,201 --> 01:31:14,043
That is the system here.

1113
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:16,046
That is the system here. Is it?

1114
01:31:16,237 --> 01:31:16,874
What?

1115
01:31:18,206 --> 01:31:24,054
Sir..PF and gratuity are
cut from our salary.

1116
01:31:24,612 --> 01:31:25,920
Can't she withdraw that?

1117
01:31:26,681 --> 01:31:27,819
You can do that.

1118
01:31:30,751 --> 01:31:31,752
Your employee code?

1119
01:31:33,054 --> 01:31:34,795
Tell me your employee code.

1120
01:31:35,056 --> 01:31:38,799

1121
01:31:46,834 --> 01:31:50,611
lt comes only to 72600.

1122
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:55,954
Not only that.

1123
01:31:56,043 --> 01:31:58,819
Full withdrawal is possible only
when you resign or are terminated.

1124
01:32:02,216 --> 01:32:06,289
Then, if you resign, you will get
another 25000 from the com pany.

1125
01:32:07,622 --> 01:32:08,293
Sir..

1126
01:32:08,789 --> 01:32:13,067
Can you appoint her
afresh after she resigns?

1127
01:32:15,196 --> 01:32:18,973
You can't even apply to any branch of
the company forthe next one year.

1128
01:32:22,136 --> 01:32:23,308
Think about it and decide.

1129
01:32:38,753 --> 01:32:40,664
0h..You were here?

1130
01:32:41,055 --> 01:32:44,935
I thought you submitted
the resignation and Ieft.

1131
01:32:45,092 --> 01:32:46,264
Sister ..

1132
01:32:46,661 --> 01:32:49,972
How can you pull on
by selling milk and eggs?

<i>IhmmwgJmm</i>

1134
01:32:52,066 --> 01:32:54,307
No other way, Vini.

1135
01:32:54,769 --> 01:32:59,240
Ifl can getjob in households as cook
I can earn about 5000 a month.

1136
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:02,780
Still..You should have thought
one more time before giving the Ietter.

Määüfiämflam

1138
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:08,060
If we don't pay before fifteenth...

1139
01:33:08,282 --> 01:33:10,728
...she said she would also
join me as a house maid.

1140
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:15,828
Isn't it tenth today?

1141
01:33:15,957 --> 01:33:17,766
Has she decided on the date of depanure?

1142
01:33:18,826 --> 01:33:19,304
Yes..

1143
01:33:24,865 --> 01:33:27,004
The flight is from Chennai on 31st.

1144
01:33:28,336 --> 01:33:30,179
She has to Ieave from here on the 29th.

1145
01:33:34,208 --> 01:33:35,983
Sister..What is this?

1146
01:33:36,711 --> 01:33:38,315
We made a decision.

1147
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:41,356
Why do you brood over it again?

1148
01:33:43,784 --> 01:33:46,924
The money from here makes it 2 Iakhs.

1149
01:33:47,355 --> 01:33:49,892
Will the money Iender bhai
give another4 Iakhs?

1150
01:33:50,257 --> 01:33:51,167
Let us hope.

1151
01:33:51,726 --> 01:33:53,000
Let us hope. Even if it is three,

1152
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:54,705
only one more Iakh will be required

1153
01:33:57,898 --> 01:34:01,209
I will tell her that
we would pay on the fifteenth itself.

1154
01:34:03,304 --> 01:34:06,649
That day itself I will
vacate her from the hostel.

1155
01:34:07,208 --> 01:34:10,621
I have to feed her well
and make her healthy.

1156
01:34:11,879 --> 01:34:13,825
She Ioo ks weak now.

1157
01:34:21,389 --> 01:34:22,265
Take this.

1158
01:34:25,326 --> 01:34:26,703
Ninety seven.

1159
01:34:27,361 --> 01:34:30,274
The company has to give you 97,600 rupees.

1160
01:34:31,132 --> 01:34:32,873
I rounded it up and am giving you one Iakh.

1161
01:34:33,267 --> 01:34:34,143
Thanks Sir.

1162
01:34:36,203 --> 01:34:38,149

Sir..

1167
01:35:01,262 --> 01:35:02,969
You didn't tell me what is my job.

1168
01:35:03,731 --> 01:35:04,937
You can ask someone outside.

1169
01:35:07,168 --> 01:35:08,374
What the hell!!

1170
01:35:14,875 --> 01:35:16,479
How can you be so stupid,.. Vinitha.

1171
01:35:17,011 --> 01:35:19,855
You want me to give 4 Iakhs
on this silly paper?

1172
01:35:21,449 --> 01:35:25,124
Bhai..Didn't I tell you that day
that the documents are not correct?

1174

I can't do it.

1175
01:35:30,758 --> 01:35:32,999
We have to make a
hypothecation document with her.

1176
01:35:33,194 --> 01:35:34,332
On stamp paper.

1177
01:35:34,829 --> 01:35:36,866
But don't you need at least
a document of the Iand?

1178
01:35:37,398 --> 01:35:39,241
Bhai..it is for her sister's daughter.

1179
01:35:39,767 --> 01:35:42,111
They have to give the money tomorrow.
Please don't cheat us

1180
01:35:44,371 --> 01:35:46,009
I wanted to help you and
I am a cheat now...!!

PIease..Bhai..

1183
01:35:49,977 --> 01:35:51,251
Leave the Iand's guarantee.

1184
01:35:51,779 --> 01:35:53,725
If you trust me, give her the money.

1185
01:35:54,982 --> 01:35:57,724
Or give methe cash. I
will return in six months.

1186
01:35:58,519 --> 01:35:59,793
With interest.

Please, Bhai..

1188
01:36:01,522 --> 01:36:02,500
Don't Ieave us.

1189
01:36:03,190 --> 01:36:04,999
She promised them believing my words.

1190
01:36:05,326 --> 01:36:06,737
Howmuch do you get novr?

01:36:08,095 --> 01:36:09,233
22 thousand

1192
01:36:11,132 --> 01:36:13,169
I can tell you something which is possible

1193
01:36:13,267 --> 01:36:15,406
I can Iend you 100,000 on your guarantee.

1194
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:16,942
No Bhai..That is not enough.

1195
01:36:17,138 --> 01:36:19,118
Only that is possible ..
Or else you can go.

1196
01:36:24,178 --> 01:36:24,849
Why?

1197
01:36:24,979 --> 01:36:25,753

a Iimit forthe risk I take.

I told you what I can do.

1203

We will talk to that travel agent, Sister.

1207

We can somehow manage to
pay three Iakhs tomorrow.

You need to think
about the balance amount only.

01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:00,670
You com e.

1245
01:40:01,228 --> 01:40:01,706
Just a sec...PIease.

1246
01:40:05,099 --> 01:40:06,669
Don't stay in hostel any more.

1247
01:40:07,501 --> 01:40:10,641
I have decided to take
you home today itself.

1248
01:40:11,705 --> 01:40:14,117
But Mama..er...College..

1249
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:17,216
I haue to get an assignment sig ned from
the college.

1250
01:40:18,178 --> 01:40:22,388
I will come home in
a couple of days after getting that..

1251
01:40:24,218 --> 01:40:24,593
Sister.

1252
01:40:26,387 --> 01:40:27,457
Will you just come with me?

1253
01:40:39,133 --> 01:40:39,770
Sister...

1254
01:40:41,568 --> 01:40:42,171
Mama,

1255
01:40:43,670 --> 01:40:44,148
Mama,

1256
01:40:44,571 --> 01:40:45,515
Mama, What happened?

1257
01:40:47,341 --> 01:40:48,513
She was just talking...

1258
01:40:50,110 --> 01:40:51,316
Vini..Let us go now.

1259
01:40:51,612 --> 01:40:53,387
These people can manage things here.

1260
01:40:54,615 --> 01:40:55,593
Can I call an autorikshamf?

1261
01:40:58,385 --> 01:41:02,197
Who among you paid for Charu's passpon?

1262
01:41:03,690 --> 01:41:04,430
Is it you?

1263
01:41:11,498 --> 01:41:12,772
I don't know how much you spent.

1264
01:41:13,167 --> 01:41:13,838
It is ok aunty..don't mind.

1265
01:41:14,201 --> 01:41:19,651
It is my daughter's case and
it is my responsibility.

1266
01:41:50,437 --> 01:41:54,544
Papa, Don't think that I don't think
about the future when I talk to you.

1267
01:41:55,409 --> 01:41:59,619
My only aim now is to fulfill Charu's wish.

1268
01:42:04,718 --> 01:42:06,527
And there is no way out...

1269
01:42:07,721 --> 01:42:08,529
What is it dear?

1270
01:42:09,156 --> 01:42:10,533
Are you selling this house?

1271
01:42:11,792 --> 01:42:12,566
Papa..

1272
01:42:22,669 --> 01:42:25,707
Our greatest needs are
actually Charu's needs.

1273
01:42:26,373 --> 01:42:31,516
What is the point in holding on to this
Iand if we can't fulfill herwishes?

1274
01:42:32,479 --> 01:42:36,859
Ifthis makes her future secure,
then we should do that.

1275
01:42:47,327 --> 01:42:48,704
This was where you were
born and brought up.

1276
01:42:49,630 --> 01:42:50,938
It is on this soil that
your mother was cremated.

1277
01:42:51,965 --> 01:42:55,412
But if this soil can bring security
to our daughter ..

1278
01:42:55,969 --> 01:42:58,711
For what else can it be useful?

1279
01:43:02,943 --> 01:43:05,150
We can rent a small house in city.

1280
01:43:07,648 --> 01:43:12,222
It is enough, if we get a shed where it doesn't
Ieak during rains... and is not too cold for you.

1281
01:43:17,758 --> 01:43:19,237
Isn't it enough Papa?

1282
01:43:20,527 --> 01:43:21,631
More than enough..

1283
01:43:22,462 --> 01:43:25,841
But, who would buy this house
which has no documents?

1284
01:43:41,848 --> 01:43:48,265
Panchayath member Dilip can help us.

1285
01:43:50,224 --> 01:43:51,532
He can manage that.

1286
01:43:52,226 --> 01:43:53,466
Then don't be Iate.

1287
01:43:54,027 --> 01:43:56,439
Go to him or call him
in the morning itself.

1288
01:43:57,464 --> 01:43:59,239
We don't have much time Ieft.

1289
01:44:00,767 --> 01:44:02,007
Did you hear?

1290
01:44:04,504 --> 01:44:05,778
Get the gruel ready.

1291
01:44:14,348 --> 01:44:15,258
Gopaletta...

1292
01:44:24,992 --> 01:44:27,563
This much money would be
enough for Charumol's studies?

1293
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:31,505
Don't sell this house..Papa.

1294
01:44:32,432 --> 01:44:34,434
Where did you keep this?

1295
01:44:34,835 --> 01:44:36,439
In the kitchen.
Underthe oven.

1296
01:44:36,837 --> 01:44:38,339
I had kept it aside for Charumol's wedding.

1297
01:44:39,006 --> 01:44:40,815
Brought it when you were in the hospital.

1298
01:44:41,408 --> 01:44:42,853
But only 107 rupees were spent.

1299
01:44:43,577 --> 01:44:45,420
Another 4000 rupees will be there.

1300
01:44:46,813 --> 01:44:48,690
Charumol requires Iakhs for her studies.

1301
01:44:49,816 --> 01:44:51,261
You can keep this with yourself.

1302
01:44:51,752 --> 01:44:53,026
Money will be required any time.

1303
01:44:56,657 --> 01:44:57,761
Then we have to sell the house?

1304
01:44:59,626 --> 01:45:04,439
You shouldn't waste your time
cleaning cowshed and Iooking after hens..

1305
01:45:05,732 --> 01:45:07,006
You should look for a job for him too,
Dean

1306
01:45:07,534 --> 01:45:08,410
Whatever he can do..

1307
01:45:09,303 --> 01:45:10,043
Yes..I will do that.

1308
01:45:11,305 --> 01:45:12,409
I will get the gruel foryou.

1309
01:45:13,106 --> 01:45:14,312
If we sell the house,

1310
01:45:14,541 --> 01:45:16,384
what would happen to the cow,
calf and hens?

1311
01:45:19,379 --> 01:45:20,323
Will you sell them too?

1312
01:45:38,332 --> 01:45:39,436
Now..You sign.

1313
01:45:44,971 --> 01:45:45,949
Here.

1314
01:45:53,513 --> 01:45:54,457
Here..

1315
01:46:02,689 --> 01:46:03,724
Here too.

1316
01:46:09,863 --> 01:46:11,672
Now you put your signature.

1317
01:46:18,972 --> 01:46:19,882
Here

1318
01:46:43,663 --> 01:46:46,644
2.5 Iakhs...I counted thrice.

1319
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,411
You can count again.

1320
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:55,879
Give me 50000 more sir.

1321
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:59,016
Uwm
stäflflflmg]

1322
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:00,585
Oh..No

1323
01:47:00,781 --> 01:47:02,158
I told you that day itself.

1324
01:47:03,450 --> 01:47:05,430
.You just signed the stamp papers.

1325
01:47:06,153 --> 01:47:09,999
I have to invest another 2 to 3 Iakhs
to make documents proper.

1326
01:47:10,457 --> 01:47:15,031
Then only I will be able to sell it to
the IAS guy staying in the neighborhood.

1327
01:47:15,662 --> 01:47:16,766
Till then, it is a risk.

1328
01:47:17,864 --> 01:47:18,399
Member...

1329
01:47:18,632 --> 01:47:20,942
can we stay here for some more time,
as told earlier?

1330
01:47:21,168 --> 01:47:24,615
Of course. You can stay for
two, three orfour weeks ..

1331
01:47:26,106 --> 01:47:29,576
Are you fine? Prabhu.

1332
01:47:44,024 --> 01:47:45,867
Mam a..

1333
01:48:19,993 --> 01:48:23,907
I don't say that I wouldn't come or
I am going back on my commitment..Sudhi.

1334
01:48:24,598 --> 01:48:29,707
I wanted to enquire whetherwe can extend
ourtrip for another couple of months.

1335
01:48:31,071 --> 01:48:34,052
She sold her house, resigned herjob...

1336
01:48:34,174 --> 01:48:36,211
...and borrowed money from wherever possible.

1337
01:48:36,643 --> 01:48:38,623
Nly poor mother is sending me...

1338
01:48:39,579 --> 01:48:41,923
Thinking that I am going
for higher studies.

1339
01:48:42,649 --> 01:48:45,994
She doesn't knowthat I am going
to live with my partnen.

1340
01:48:46,987 --> 01:48:52,562
If she knows, any time, thatl cheated her,
she will collapse totally.

1341
01:48:52,926 --> 01:48:57,773
Ifl get one ortwo months,
I can convince her that we are in Iove...

1342
01:48:57,964 --> 01:48:59,773
...and are going in search of a job.

1343
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,981
And she might permit me to go.

1344
01:49:03,970 --> 01:49:07,543
Look..We can settle down
there by that time.

1345
01:49:07,941 --> 01:49:11,252
And you can send money
monthly to your mother.

1346
01:49:11,945 --> 01:49:15,722
Then. Gradually, step by step
we can Iet her knowthings.

1347
01:49:16,182 --> 01:49:20,221
We can make it Iook Iike we have
permission from your motherfor marriage.

1348
01:49:20,687 --> 01:49:23,964
If you want, we can cover the marriage in
video and send it to your mother.

1349
01:49:24,257 --> 01:49:29,331
You can say that you don't get Ieave
and thus extend our stay there every year.

1350
01:49:29,996 --> 01:49:32,943
For all the founeen years, Is it?

1351
01:49:33,166 --> 01:49:36,238
Though Catherine said Iike that,

1352
01:49:36,603 --> 01:49:39,605
m
mm

1353
01:49:39,606 --> 01:49:42,587
...with this company
if we pay com pensation.

1354
01:49:42,976 --> 01:49:46,355
If we get a suitable package,
we will jump on to that.

1355
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:48,553
And will come home, meet mother

1356
01:49:48,915 --> 01:49:53,830
I shared my feelings. But you
are talking something else.

1357
01:49:54,020 --> 01:49:57,866
Becmsljlegyec:Ligxzifiägoägfitm e.

1358
01:49:58,191 --> 01:50:00,899
We are going to Canada, we are
going to get settled overthere,

1359
01:50:01,061 --> 01:50:02,836
...your mother is getting a better Iife.

1360
01:50:03,063 --> 01:50:05,669
Just think positively.

1361
01:50:07,167 --> 01:50:09,773
0k..Sudhi... I will call you.

1362
01:50:12,372 --> 01:50:13,316
MN sir?

1363
01:50:13,607 --> 01:50:14,847
No idea where is he.

1364
01:50:15,008 --> 01:50:16,385
Hasn't given the key also
Is not picking upthe phone.

1365
01:50:16,977 --> 01:50:19,958
When he comes I will tell him you had come.

1366
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:21,955
Whenl called day before yesterday...

1367
01:50:22,082 --> 01:50:25,086
...he asked me to come today
and said we could manage everything.

1368
01:50:25,719 --> 01:50:26,959
Give me the phone.

1369
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:29,691
I will post a message to him.

1370
01:50:29,856 --> 01:50:31,164
May be he is busy.

1371
01:50:32,158 --> 01:50:33,102
Go ahead.

1372
01:50:35,395 --> 01:50:37,170
What can we do now, Vini?

1373
01:50:37,263 --> 01:50:42,008
Massage is there.
He will call when he sees the message.

1374
01:50:51,978 --> 01:50:53,389
It is about to stop Iactation.

1375
01:50:53,647 --> 01:50:54,853
At the most 25000.

1376
01:50:55,315 --> 01:50:56,794
If it is ok for you I will give
you the money in the evening

1377
01:50:56,916 --> 01:50:58,793
I will deduct the Iabor charges also

1378
01:51:00,854 --> 01:51:02,993
I told you we would sell it only for 50000.

1379
01:51:03,156 --> 01:51:04,635
Can't assure you without seeing the cow.

1380
01:51:04,691 --> 01:51:06,261
Is it a Gulf guy's wedding?

1381
01:51:08,695 --> 01:51:12,199
You are giving just 25000 for
this cow and the big calf?

1382
01:51:12,332 --> 01:51:14,107
Yes. Cow and the calf together 25,000.

1383
01:51:14,234 --> 01:51:15,144
Only 10000 forthis alone.

1384
01:51:15,669 --> 01:51:16,977
This is a good Iactating cow.

1385
01:51:17,037 --> 01:51:18,675
You knowthat we are in urgent need...

1386
01:51:18,738 --> 01:51:19,944
Not possible..

1387
01:51:22,475 --> 01:51:24,045
I am Johnnychan Kuzhalmannam.

1388
01:51:24,444 --> 01:51:26,151
I am a publisher.

1389
01:51:26,346 --> 01:51:27,256
Came here after MN told me.

1390
01:51:27,747 --> 01:51:28,885
Where is MN sir?

1391
01:51:29,015 --> 01:51:32,929
Hospitalised after a small accident.
He lost his phone too.

1392
01:51:33,486 --> 01:51:37,024
Will take another three orfour days
to be discharged.

1393
01:51:37,857 --> 01:51:38,961

Cas h..50000 rupees.

How did you find our house?

1396
01:51:44,330 --> 01:51:45,434
He told me the Iocation.

1397
01:51:45,699 --> 01:51:47,178
Was a Iittle difficult to find out.

1398
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:48,677
Come inside.

1399
01:51:48,802 --> 01:51:50,179

Dude..We are not selling the cow.

1402
01:51:52,839 --> 01:51:54,375
You can go in that boat.

1403
01:51:54,507 --> 01:51:56,009
Ok

1404
01:51:56,443 --> 01:51:59,287

Didn't you sleep last nig ht? Mama.

01:54:20,587 --> 01:54:23,431
The heated oil must be getting got cold..

01:54:23,556 --> 01:54:26,230
Massage it on your hair and take bath.

1411

Mama..You should be happy.I
will call you every day.

1412
01:54:38,605 --> 01:54:42,075
And will send a Ietter every month.

01:54:42,342 --> 01:54:46,313
When I have enough money,
I will buy a computerfor you.

1414
01:54:47,146 --> 01:54:50,059
Then we can see each other and talk..Hm?

1415
01:54:52,151 --> 01:54:56,099
Don't you think about me.

1416
01:54:57,156 --> 01:55:03,869
You should knowthat in the new surroundings
you are the only person thinking about you.

1417
01:55:07,467 --> 01:55:16,182
When you get Iot of conveniences and
comfons you might get over enthusiastic...

1418
01:55:22,949 --> 01:55:25,486
Not that you shouldn't have
anything foryour happiness..

1419
01:55:26,452 --> 01:55:27,453
But only just as much as you need..

1420
01:55:31,190 --> 01:55:39,610
After a Iong time, if you feel that
you had a happy and meaningful Iife...

1421
01:55:40,333 --> 01:55:46,249
and had enough of everything,
then you really feel happy.

1422
01:56:12,632 --> 01:56:22,451
Don't worry sincel am not
there to attend to your needs.

1423
01:56:31,417 --> 01:56:36,765
We can do anything single handedly.

1424
01:56:38,257 --> 01:56:41,238
You have to have a will for it.

1425
01:56:49,669 --> 01:56:54,345
Don't trouble your friends
for silly things.

1426
01:56:55,708 --> 01:56:58,587
However close the relation
with them may be..

1427
01:57:05,485 --> 01:57:09,797
Don't you think about me.

1428
01:57:13,793 --> 01:57:17,502
But don't get weak...

1429
01:57:17,764 --> 01:57:21,234
You can change all those ..

1430
01:57:34,414 --> 01:57:36,758
No one has woken up?

1431
01:57:40,553 --> 01:57:42,089
Go paletta..

1432
01:57:51,564 --> 01:57:52,542
No one is here?

1433
01:57:56,269 --> 01:57:57,145
Uncle.

1434
01:57:58,337 --> 01:58:00,146
No one has woken up?

1435
01:58:00,239 --> 01:58:02,082
I thought you haven't woken up.

1436
01:58:02,175 --> 01:58:03,449
Do you have a Iot of Iuggage?

1437
01:58:04,210 --> 01:58:05,211
If you want I can call another boat too.

1438
01:58:05,478 --> 01:58:06,548
Only two bags.

1439
01:58:06,712 --> 01:58:08,658
Then, get ready..come fast.

1440
01:58:08,748 --> 01:58:10,421
Isn't the train at 10?

1441
01:58:45,885 --> 01:58:48,161
Don't cry grandpa..

1442
01:58:50,256 --> 01:58:52,258
Take your medicines regularly.

1443
01:58:54,861 --> 01:58:56,863
Look after my mother well.

1444
01:59:07,173 --> 01:59:08,709
Esm

1445
01:59:12,845 --> 01:59:16,156
Get blessings and get ready to go.

1446
02:00:34,493 --> 02:00:35,836
Go with a smile.. Dear..

1447
02:00:36,229 --> 02:00:40,006
You have to become a big
officer afteryour studies.

1448
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:41,901
Don't cry.

1449
02:01:36,622 --> 02:01:40,729
It is Iike she has come home on holidays
and going back to hostel.

1450
02:01:40,993 --> 02:01:43,701
This time the hostel is very far off..

1451
02:02:09,989 --> 02:02:12,731
Why? You are in balcony since Iong.

1452
02:02:13,059 --> 02:02:17,530
It must be more than an hour
since the flight took off from Chennai.

1453
02:02:18,698 --> 02:02:20,871
She called me before she boarded.

1454
02:02:23,969 --> 02:02:26,313
Sir.We have to cross the ocean
to reach Canada, Is it?

1455
02:02:26,405 --> 02:02:26,974
Yes.

1456
02:02:29,408 --> 02:02:38,123
Sir..I have shown her, plane flying, so many times,
holding her in my hands When she was a child..

1457
02:02:41,887 --> 02:02:46,461
Now she is flying alone...

1458
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:49,362
Would she be remembering that?

1459
02:02:51,630 --> 02:02:52,768
No doubt.

1460
02:02:53,432 --> 02:02:58,108
She will be thanking you for giving her
the opponunity to fly high.

1461
02:02:59,839 --> 02:03:06,848
There is that flight. Will
she be in that flight, Sir?

1462
02:03:07,079 --> 02:03:13,121
Looking down at the ground from a flight
we will be seen Iike dots..isn't it Sir?

1463
02:03:17,189 --> 02:03:19,760
I wonder if she Iooked down at us..

1464
02:03:26,932 --> 02:03:28,536
Don't worry so much.

1465
02:03:28,701 --> 02:03:30,806
She will come here for the next vacation.

1466
02:03:31,103 --> 02:03:35,779
No She won't come, sir.

1467
02:03:37,576 --> 02:03:42,047
She can't come back for many years.

1468
02:03:46,919 --> 02:03:49,866
She didn't go for any studies.

1469
02:03:50,956 --> 02:03:55,996
She has migrated... My Iittle one
With her husband...

1470
02:03:57,563 --> 02:03:58,837
Husband?

1471
02:03:59,732 --> 02:04:04,681
Yes.She Iied to me. So
that I won't get upset.

1472
02:04:08,007 --> 02:04:14,686
How could she tell me that she is
discontinuing studies and eloping?

1473
02:04:15,548 --> 02:04:16,788
Won't I be sad?

1474
02:04:16,949 --> 02:04:18,758
Won't her grandpa be sad?

1475
02:04:19,618 --> 02:04:21,928
What ifl beat her up?

1476
02:04:22,154 --> 02:04:23,792
May be that is why she didn't tell me.

1477
02:04:25,090 --> 02:04:26,626
How did you knowthis?

1478
02:04:27,593 --> 02:04:30,096
Vinitha's friend who works
inthe travels told her.

1479
02:04:30,629 --> 02:04:31,471
Too bad!!

1480
02:04:31,764 --> 02:04:33,573
This is the problem with
the newgeneration.

1481
02:04:34,600 --> 02:04:38,707
Move to one's own comfon zone. They
don't bother if anyone is hun on that.

1482
02:04:38,971 --> 02:04:42,282
This generation is not bothered
about the sacrifices and pain...

1483
02:04:42,374 --> 02:04:44,877
...that their dear ones have gone
through for them.

1484
02:04:45,244 --> 02:04:48,657
Don't blame her Iike that Sir.

1485
02:04:49,114 --> 02:04:52,527
I have dreamt of Charu's future.

1486
02:04:52,651 --> 02:04:55,029
But those were minor things.

1487
02:04:55,120 --> 02:04:59,967
A permanentjob, a sorrowless
family, that was it

1488
02:05:02,695 --> 02:05:06,507
Bun she is an educated
and intelligent girl.

1489
02:05:06,866 --> 02:05:09,472
May be she has Iarger dreams.

1490
02:05:11,036 --> 02:05:13,516
If what Vinitha and sir said is right,

1491
02:05:14,974 --> 02:05:17,181
...my daughter will be in a great
position after two years.

1492
02:05:18,878 --> 02:05:23,520
She will live happily
with the person she Ioves

1493
02:05:28,053 --> 02:05:30,499
I hope he is a nice guy.

1494
02:05:32,291 --> 02:05:35,272
How can you be Iike this...?

1495
02:05:37,062 --> 02:05:39,975
You sold your house, lost yourjob,
became a debtor..

1496
02:05:40,633 --> 02:05:43,079
Still, how can you stay Iike this
without getting exhausted?

1497
02:05:43,903 --> 02:05:48,010
I can't afford to get exhausted.Actually,
I should work more now.

1498
02:05:48,774 --> 02:05:55,658
Have to Iook after my father,
have to pay back Ioans step by step,

1499
02:05:55,948 --> 02:05:59,122
By the time Charu comes back
I have to make a house ..

1500
02:05:59,552 --> 02:06:03,090
A decent house...where she can stay

1501
02:06:03,722 --> 02:06:05,827
I have to do a Iot more work in Iife...

1502
02:06:05,925 --> 02:06:08,804
I don't have time to get
depressed or be sad.

1503
02:06:12,197 --> 02:06:13,904
Let me go.

1504
02:06:15,601 --> 02:06:18,172
