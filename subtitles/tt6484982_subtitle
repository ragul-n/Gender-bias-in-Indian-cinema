00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,150
Long Live Mangal Netam!

3
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,900
I am not here to seek votes.

4
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,020
Don't vote for me.

5
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,320
I want development for you all.

6
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:54,130
My dream is to see every child
with a laptop in their right hand.

7
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,410
And a cell-phone in their left.

8
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,950
But they stand like thorns
in my path

9
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,200
I won't allow it as long as I live.

10
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,950
The Commies quote parables,
and I perform miracles.

11
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,610
If they shoot arrows,
I fire cannons.

12
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,920
Long Live Mangal Netam!

13
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,820
We'll have dinner together.

14
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:42,110
Don't worry. We're nearly there.

15
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,990
Sir!

16
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:48,280
Turn the car around!

17
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,110
Get down!

18
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,280
The third incident in two weeks.

19
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,460
The Maoists have struck again.

20
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:24,420
The government has promised
stern action.

21
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,990
Additional reinforcements
will be deployed.

22
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,280
Oh no!

23
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,850
The power has gone again.

24
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,080
Nutan

25
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,810
- I'm checking.
- Son, go and see.

26
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,430
The others have power.

27
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,840
- I'll check the fuse.
- Is it just us?

28
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,350
Must have tripped

29
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,140
Chanchal has left. His workshop
is so successful.

30
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,710
He has opened a showroom too.

31
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,410
His wife works with him.

32
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,390
- The fuse gone again?
- Yes.

33
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,900
Everyone is getting married
but our son.

34
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,950
You seem to know everything.

35
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,950
I worry about my son.

36
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,160
- Is the power back?
- Yes, son.

37
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,820
- Attending tomorrow's workshop?
- Yes.

38
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,960
The Indian election...

39
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,270
The elections will cost
five billion dollars

40
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,360
814 million voters

41
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,460
9 million polling booths.

42
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,860
We break our own records
with every new election.

43
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,820
We've proved it.

44
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,490
Although some rogues get elected
to parliament...

45
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,760
...we will not allow gangster tactics
in the elections.

46
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,390
How?

47
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:09,070
Because we, the election volunteers,
will not let it happen.

48
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,580
Very well.

49
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,170
That's if we aren't bumped off.

50
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,710
Who said that?

51
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,510
Stand up! You won't be punished.

52
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:29,730
It's natural to be afraid after
what happened yesterday.

53
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,350
Only human nature.

54
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:37,700
The Maoists have made it clear
they'll boycott the elections.

55
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:43,340
There is only one weapon
to stop them and that is...

56
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,410
...our voting machine.

57
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,990
Remember we have only
one aim...

58
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,440
...to hold free and fair elections.

59
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:58,220
What if the Maoists attack our
polling booth? What do we do?

60
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,820
Don't play the hero.
Do as they ask.

61
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,320
They want the voting machine,
hand it over.

62
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:11,130
We'll cancel the votes and
re-election will be organized.

63
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,010
Anyone else?

64
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,300
And if they attack on re-election
day?

65
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,980
Then we'll have another
re-election.

66
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,690
What if they attack on the
"re-re" election day?

67
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,600
What's your name?

68
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,560
Newton

69
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,210
Newton?

70
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,600
"Apple" Newton?

71
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,950
Newton, what comes after two?

72
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,660
- Three.
- After three?

73
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,340
- Four.
- After four?

74
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,490
Good boy, sit down.

75
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,590
You explained things so well, sir.

76
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,910
My respects to you, sir.

77
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,240
Never mind.

78
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,070
Sir, you made light of
my simple doubt.

79
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,600
My answer only matched
your question.

80
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,030
- Sir, I genuinely wanted...
- Of course, sit down

81
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,840
Newton.

82
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,800
Tell me who named you?

83
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,490
Was your father a physics teacher?
Your mother's whim?

84
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,990
- Who named you?
- I named myself.

85
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,160
Meaning?

86
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,260
But why?

87
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,270
My parents named me Nutan (new)
Kumar. Made the school kids laugh.

88
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,990
Just like you.

89
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,450
Nutan Kumar!

90
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,850
So what did you do?

91
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,430
On the class 10 form, I changed "Nu"
to "New," and "tan" to "ton".

92
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,280
Changed "Nu" to "New" and "tan"
to "ton".

93
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,490
You gave yourself a big name
to live up to.

94
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,010
Like you're blowing your
own trumpet.

95
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,700
- Testing me again?
- Who am I to test anyone?

96
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,320
Tell me.

97
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,760
Do you know how Newton
changed the world?

98
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,460
Gravity. Optics.

99
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,390
For years you've lived as Newton...

100
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,060
...but forgotten the essential.

101
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,570
He leveled all differences.
Ask me how.

102
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,910
How?

103
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,710
Before Newton, people thought
there were different laws...

104
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,550
...for heaven and earth.

105
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,860
For church and temple.

106
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,580
Different laws for kings
and commoners like us.

107
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,930
But at a single stroke,
Newton proved us wrong.

108
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,900
Nature treats everyone equally.

109
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,500
Tycoon Ambani and a tea-seller
jump off a cliff simultaneously.

110
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,970
They'll land together
at the same time

111
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:17,080
Newton proved - for Nature
we're all the same.

112
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,530
King or beggar.

113
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,900
- Which department are you in?
- Not assigned yet. Still on probation.

114
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,030
Why are you on election duty?

115
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,860
I'm a Reserve.

116
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,110
Good. Reserves are useful.

117
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:38,110
There's always a 12th player
in cricket and football too.

118
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,710
This place must seem a small town
next to Bhopal.

119
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,570
Wherever our son is happy
is fine by us.

120
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,860
You're so right.

121
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,360
Retirement is better spent with
one's children.

122
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,590
You don't look over 60

123
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,200
60? I'm just 57.

124
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:05,880
My son forced me to take early
retirement when he got a job.

125
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,560
If only all sons were like Nutan.

126
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,200
It's Newton.

127
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,200
Our daughter Ankita made this.

128
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,820
She has always loved to embroider.

129
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,530
You won't lose your handkerchiefs
again.

130
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,820
Our daughter will embroider
your initials on them.

131
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,190
He keeps losing them.

132
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,740
Here she is.

133
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:38,950
How are you?

134
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:43,860
We're fine. I hope you're well too.

135
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,210
Eat something with the chai.

136
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,230
- Did Ankita cook them?
- Yes.

137
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,970
Please sit.

138
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,590
Nutan, have a pakora

139
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,180
Newton.

140
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,040
My English is very poor.

141
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,450
Drink up before a fly falls into it.

142
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,320
If you want to ask her something,
go ahead.

143
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,370
Saving it for after the wedding?

144
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,850
Seen her embroidery,
had pakoras and tea.

145
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,760
Nothing left to ask.

146
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:30,660
Let him ask. He has a Masters
in physics.

147
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,910
Ask her something, son.

148
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:43,560
- Have you any hobbies?
- I love watching movies.

149
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,780
- What's your favorite movie?
- "Sweety goes to her in-laws".

150
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,780
Which college did you attend?

151
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,530
I didn't go to college

152
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,190
I'd never send her to
that den of rascals.

153
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,450
Studying is a ruse for wasting time.

154
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,990
And after high school?

155
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,310
I left in Class 9.

156
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,260
- When was that?
- Three years ago.

157
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,950
How old are you?

158
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,170
Sixteen and a half.

159
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,500
She's a minor.

160
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,600
Nutan, better that she grows up
at her in-laws.

161
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,860
- Sit down.
- She's underage.

162
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,570
Please sit.

163
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,010
She's underage.

164
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,410
Not for long. Marry her later.

165
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,100
Her father is a contractor.

166
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,320
You're a government officer.
A life of ease.

167
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,830
- Sorry, not interested.
- Son, don't say no.

168
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,020
The dowry is 1 million rupees
cash and a motorcycle.

169
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,580
Don't want any of it.

170
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,930
Who's giving it to you? I'll take it.

171
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,410
Talking back to your father.

172
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,870
Calm down

173
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,050
I will marry a graduate.

174
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,970
Chewing your own degree isn't enough?
Must she have one too?

175
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,670
What's wrong with a college graduate?

176
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,530
Will she massage your
mother's feet?

177
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,820
The job has made you deluded.

178
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,870
Next you'll want to marry a
high caste girl.

179
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,990
Too big for your boots.

180
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,510
Calm down

181
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,290
I will never marry. Happy?

182
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:42,950
Try these Bollywood lines
on your office intern.

183
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,430
I am your father.
You good-for-nothing.

184
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,420
- Calm down.
- Why?

185
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,090
You've spoilt him rotten.

186
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,530
The office atmosphere is peculiar.

187
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,150
People play cards, trim their nails.

188
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,260
They just pass time.

189
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,730
No file moves without a bribe.

190
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:28,910
Everyone thinks like you at first.
Soon you'll be like them

191
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:34,090
I'm not there to make money.
A call centre would pay more.

192
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,030
I want to make a difference

193
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,720
Newton, you know your problem?

194
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,410
My honesty?

195
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,780
No.

196
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,050
Your arrogance about your honesty

197
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:02,210
Newton, your honesty is not doing
the world a favor.

198
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,050
It is expected of you.

199
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,770
Honesty makes the heart lighter,
less burdened.

200
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,550
The office is closing.

201
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,390
Keep working with your
honesty intact.

202
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:24,090
The country will progress alongside.

203
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,410
Kamal, here's the ink

204
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,680
...the strip seal, stamp...

205
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:59,030
...chalk, wax and carbon.

206
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:05,160
Here. It's all on this list.

207
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:08,820
- Sir, you've forgotten the green seal.
- Sorry. Here.

208
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:13,980
- The rule book.
- No need. I know it by heart.

209
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,180
He's bright. Don't need to
tell him anything.

210
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,430
Kamal Kishore, you look smart.

211
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,740
Know how to work it?

212
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,210
We keep the control unit.
The balloting unit is...

213
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,730
...is used by the voters.

214
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:38,010
- Know where you're going?
- Booth no. 148

215
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,110
Kondanar.

216
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,840
Very first elections there.

217
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,200
Only 76 voters.

218
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:50,540
No problem, sir. We have a booth
for one voter in Gir jungle.

219
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,110
Really?

220
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:57,020
This is Dandakaranya,
not Gir jungle.

221
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,260
It has a strong Maoist presence.

222
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,480
The violence was 6 months ago.
It's under our control now.

223
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,160
You'll get full security.

224
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:09,140
Two officers and a local BLO
to help you.

225
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,280
You'll fly by helicopter.

226
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,260
But I'm deputed to the City Hall?

227
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,570
- Who said so?
- Mr. Bansilal.

228
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,690
Do I make the list? Or does he?

229
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,540
You make the list, ma'am

230
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,250
I've just got married.
My wife is pregnant.

231
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,110
- I am a heart patient.
- A heart patient?

232
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,700
Did you hear that?

233
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,840
A heart patient.

234
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,030
The doctor has told me
not to fly.

235
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,070
Your medical certificate?

236
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,570
I'll bring it in an hour.

237
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,460
No, half an hour.

238
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,270
Mr. Meshram, can someone
from Reserves go?

239
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,630
I'll check, ma'am.

240
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,910
In the jungle...

241
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,660
...logic doesn't work.

242
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,270
Only instinct.

243
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,270
Didn't 19 people die in
the last election?

244
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,830
Not just here, but throughout
the county.

245
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,480
Elections are being held here
after years.

246
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:12,600
We'll know the casualties numbers
tomorrow.

247
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,510
Sir, there's a river 3-4 km away.

248
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,530
- Pakistan is up ahead.
- Pakistan?

249
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,290
The Maoists.

250
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,830
Their red flag flew here
till last August.

251
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,520
Wherever I've been posted,
people have saluted other flags.

252
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,240
Flags and floggings make nations.

253
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,610
Correct.

254
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,190
Why do you call the Maoist area
"Pakistan?"

255
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,830
God knows.

256
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:42,460
They called it that before my time.
Enemy means Pakistan.

257
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,490
Was this area under
Maoist control?

258
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,390
Now we control it.

259
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,990
But it's still dangerous.
Land mines everywhere.

260
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,740
Mind where you pee.

261
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,860
Might set off a land mine.

262
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,840
Why look at me?
You think I'll pee?

263
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,610
No, I'm just telling you.

264
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:11,030
I have diabetes. I might need
to go.

265
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,250
This is our camp.

266
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,080
Don't worry, we're safe here.

267
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,850
What time do we leave for duty?

268
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,620
The Asst. Commandant will
brief you at breakfast.

269
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,550
That's our mess.

270
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,430
Your tent is on that side.

271
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,000
Sir, careful.

272
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:04,150
Don't wander about at night.
There are scorpions and snakes.

273
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,770
Mr. Newton.

274
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:31,060
Mr. Loknath

275
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,370
Shambhu, wake up!
Loknath sir.

276
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,810
Get up! It's 4am

277
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,010
Shambhu, let's go.

278
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,680
Got any toothpaste?

279
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,120
Ask when he's coming.

280
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,150
He's on his way, sir.

281
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:10,380
Hello, Mr. Kumar

282
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,320
Atma Singh. Assistant Commandant

283
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,970
I'm Newton Kumar.

284
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,880
Upper Division Clerk,
Collector's Office

285
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,380
Loknath and Shambhu.
We're together.

286
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,490
When do we leave?

287
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,340
- Where to?
- Kondanar. For the voting.

288
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,620
Voting.

289
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,990
You eat eggs?

290
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,570
Eggs?

291
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,590
Wild fowl eggs. Our hens are
revolutionaries too

292
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:56,120
I had to interrogate them
for hours to get them out.

293
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,700
Want some? A tonic for bravery.

294
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,680
Let's go after breakfast.

295
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:26,720
It's enough that you've
made it this far.

296
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:31,270
It's unsafe beyond here.
My men will get the votes.

297
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,060
Ma'am said it's been
quiet for 6 months.

298
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,610
Really?

299
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,440
Didn't she tell you...

300
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:44,220
...about the Maoist operation
that took place 6 months ago?

301
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:51,310
If the area was safe, why are
we playing hide-n-seek here?

302
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:58,180
This is how elections are conducted
in sensitive areas

303
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:02,140
I have conducted elections in
Srinagar and Manipur.

304
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,000
But I'm the presiding officer.

305
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,950
Is the school where we'll install
the booth 8km away?

306
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,820
That's correct.

307
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,320
After the police operation,
the villagers were...

308
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:28,280
...sent to camps near the city.

309
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:32,310
- It's your area, your call.
- Please.

310
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,350
Let me do my duty.

311
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,420
There are 76 voters who live
around here.

312
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,000
Their votes are important.

313
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:46,030
Mr. Newton, they don't care
about the elections.

314
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,380
They're illiterate villagers.

315
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,870
And the Maoists have ordered them
not to vote

316
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:57,540
I'll give it to you in writing,
no one will vote.

317
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:14,150
Write it down then. I'll submit
it to the Collector's office

318
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:26,270
Jayesh!

319
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,760
Bulletproof jacket.

320
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,560
Let's hurry.

321
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:03,980
Government goods. Tie it tight,
that's if you want to live.

322
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,610
Who is this?

323
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,610
Sir, she's the BLO.

324
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,280
How did she get inside?

325
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,610
How did she?

326
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,940
She's one of our team.

327
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,860
Checked her ID?

328
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,190
Your name?

329
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,150
Malko. Malko Netam.

330
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,330
- You can't come with us.
- What?

331
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:40,910
- She must. She's a team member.
- I decide that.

332
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,940
You're not coming. Go.

333
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:46,330
The rule says a BLO
has to be present.

334
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,710
You're coming.

335
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,560
You don't get it. You can't trust
the locals.

336
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,100
You don't get it.

337
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:00,770
She's in our team. She's coming
with us.

338
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:09,040
- Do we give her a BP jacket?
- Yes

339
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,020
Yashwant! A bulletproof jacket
for madam.

340
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,200
I don't want it.

341
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,580
It's safer

342
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,130
I'm a local. I'm safer without one.

343
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,360
Take mine off then.

344
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,950
No. You're not a local.

345
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,150
- You have the voters list?
- Yes.

346
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,500
- Is it updated?
- The best I could do.

347
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,600
You have copies?

348
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:43,290
Hemant, give them their crowns.

349
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,950
Crowns?

350
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,440
Helmets.

351
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,320
Must we?

352
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,450
You'll walk in the centre.
The boys will spread out.

353
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,610
Let's go.

354
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,780
What is it?

355
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,580
Get up!

356
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,190
Sir

357
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,630
- I have to go.
- That's what we're doing

358
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,930
I mean I need to take a dump.

359
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:10,190
Why didn't you go at the camp?

360
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:14,370
I'm unlucky. I have to work hard
for small rewards.

361
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,440
A bunch of clowns.

362
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,520
Let him go, it's an emergency.

363
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,380
Let me help.

364
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:26,600
Do I look like a kid who needs help?

365
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,630
Halt!

366
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,850
How many times will you go?

367
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,940
A yogi goes once, a pleasure-seeker twice.
The ailing goes 3 times.

368
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,250
What are you, sir?

369
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,380
A pleasure-seeker.

370
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:02,350
Leave me alone. A little privacy,
please.

371
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,110
What can I say?

372
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:27,640
- He was on the phone all night.
- Talking to the girlfriend?

373
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,890
Lakhma, where are they going?

374
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,600
To gather Tendu leaves.

375
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:43,780
Bring them here.

376
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,980
Get their votes.

377
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:50,160
No, it doesn't work like that.
Voting has rules.

378
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,840
Without voter cards, they can't vote

379
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,700
Lakhma, ask them if they have
voter cards.

380
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,280
Listen.

381
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,020
Do you know it is election day?

382
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,970
You know about the elections?

383
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,510
Yes, we know.

384
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:14,280
We'll set up the booth at the
Kondanar School. Come there.

385
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,490
We'll come.

386
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,720
You must all come.

387
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,820
- Does everyone have a voter card?
- Yes.

388
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,320
Bring them with you. Don't forget.

389
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,020
We'll wait there. You must come

390
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,250
Rajman, explain it in Gondi.

391
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,350
- They might not show up.
- Why not?

392
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:44,990
They were told in Gondi that
voting stops at 11:30am.

393
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,810
Wait!

394
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,190
Voting stops at 3pm, not 11.30.

395
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,050
Come anytime before that.

396
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,870
You must come.

397
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:59,140
By 3. Not 11:30. Please translate.

398
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:06,070
Your man was lying to them.

399
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,060
Where is your old man?

400
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,240
What happened?

401
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:14,080
Six voters came but Newton
did not take their votes.

402
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,670
How could I?

403
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:20,360
6 out of 76 voters showed up.
That's a 7.5% turnout.

404
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,270
How was your turnout?

405
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,110
Thanks to you, it was 100%.

406
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,690
Did you play cricket as a kid?

407
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,650
Yes.

408
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,250
Batsman, or bowler?

409
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:44,780
Umpire.

410
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,710
Thought as much.

411
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,380
What's your opinion of
the Maoists?

412
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:56,980
No opinion.
That's why they sent me here.

413
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,400
Good.

414
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:02,960
You're intelligent. Why didn't you sit for
the civil service exam?

415
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:07,170
- I did, but I failed.
- Thought as much.

416
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,160
Do you know the capital of
Nagaland?

417
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,190
Kohima.

418
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,380
- Manipur?
- Imphal.

419
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,970
- Kashmir?
- Srinagar.

420
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,210
Seen any of those cities?

421
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,650
No.

422
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,600
Listen.

423
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,700
I have.

424
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,770
Hold it.

425
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,360
Heavy, right?

426
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:44,890
The nation's burden.
It's on our shoulders.

427
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,850
Keep moving.

428
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,990
Wait

429
00:34:55,830 --> 00:35:01,630
I'm the only one asking questions
in this jungle. OK?

430
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,640
Sir, are you related to some
government big shot?

431
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,740
No.

432
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,690
You must know someone influential.

433
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:13,910
No, why?

434
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,400
Sure you do.

435
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:20,350
No one has the guts to talk
to a police officer like that.

436
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,570
Tell me. Am I right?

437
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,560
I won't tell anyone.

438
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,760
Keep walking.

439
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,600
Mr. Atma Singh.

440
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,930
Who burned their homes?

441
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:55,320
- The villagers are safe in camps.
- Who set the village on fire?

442
00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:00,320
Does it matter? There's peace.
Everything is in control.

443
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,640
Whose idea was it to do this?

444
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:08,620
You're here for the elections.
Do your research later.

445
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:13,250
This is the school.
Lakhma, put everything inside.

446
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,250
Put it inside.

447
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:26,020
Oh God! What is this place?

448
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,040
What is this?

449
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:43,510
How can we conduct elections here?
Didn't you survey the place?

450
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,910
Yes.

451
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:49,080
I described it accurately.

452
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:58,780
Well, we can't set up here.

453
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,190
As per the rule book...

454
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:06,700
...the presiding officer can conduct
elections anywhere.

455
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,950
I told you not to come.

456
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:13,610
Let's have tea and head back

457
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:16,790
Lakhma! Tea for everyone.

458
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:21,270
Sir, this way? Please.

459
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,560
I am 59. You made me run
8kms

460
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:30,130
I have diabetes, asthma.
My cholesterol is high.

461
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:32,840
Will you make me run back?

462
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:37,470
If we have a good breakfast,
it'll help.

463
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:44,310
No one cares if elections
are held or not.

464
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,380
Did the Maoists write this?

465
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,470
If you burn their homes,
anger is natural.

466
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,850
Sir, what shall we do?

467
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,590
Decide soon, please.

468
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,410
Where shall I put all this?

469
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:57,800
Take it out.

470
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:01,610
Clear it all away.
Let's make do.

471
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,720
Decide the entry and exit.

472
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,760
They enter here. Here's your table.

473
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,960
Put a table here.

474
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,120
Let's follow the rules.

475
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,120
Listen to me.

476
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:19,730
- The entry is always to the left.
- Why not here?

477
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,500
Keep the booth here!

478
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,380
And my table here.

479
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:30,010
- Mr. Loknath, show me.
- How many times must I?

480
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:34,390
- Oh no! These mosquitoes...
- Get to the point.

481
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:37,160
The voters walk this way.

482
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:40,100
They come to me. Then to him.

483
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:43,110
They press the button.

484
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:45,480
Twirl their moustache proudly
and go

485
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,290
Nabi, you're on sentry duty.

486
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,850
- You're on OP duty.
- Ok, sir.

487
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:35,580
- Clear, everyone?
- Yes, sir.

488
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,690
He's coming out.

489
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,390
Yes?

490
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,570
Acting all friendly now.

491
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,250
What does your name mean?

492
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:11,500
- Malko means playful.
- Playful?

493
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,140
You're a teacher, right?
What do you teach?

494
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:18,580
I teach young kids. So everything.

495
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,380
Do you like teaching?

496
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:26,160
It's not easy. The children
speak Gondi.

497
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:28,930
And the textbooks are in Hindi.

498
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:32,370
I try my best to explain in Gondi.

499
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,950
They don't understand
the textbooks.

500
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,330
Anyway Hindi is outdated.

501
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,790
I was educated in Hindi, and now
see what I'm doing?

502
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,790
Teach them English. English.

503
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:47,290
Even puppies know English today.

504
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:48,670
Do you speak English?

505
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,740
I'm learning.

506
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:51,910
Adult education?

507
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:56,420
Adult? No, sir.
Watching films in English.

508
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:58,620
On my phone.

509
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,630
Return of Dracula, Bride of Chucky,
Seed of Chucky.

510
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:03,730
Brainy phone.

511
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,050
It's Chinese. It has everything.

512
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:09,730
- Are you married?
- No.

513
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,270
And you?

514
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:12,790
Good.

515
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:15,400
You?

516
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:18,440
In '83, I was going to have
a love marriage.

517
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,360
If her father hadn't made
such a big fuss...

518
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,040
...I would've had three kids by now.

519
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:28,280
Love marriages were not
the fashion then

520
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,950
Kamla was married off to
a rich old man.

521
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,300
That's terrible.

522
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:33,680
No, sir.

523
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:37,700
She's a rich widow now.

524
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:39,520
Doesn't care about me.

525
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:44,550
But I'm a writer. If I didn't suffer,
how would I write?

526
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,870
- A writer?
- Yes.

527
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:49,360
- What are you writing?
- Jungle stories.

528
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,550
A polling party come to the
jungle for the elections.

529
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:55,730
But they can't go home.

530
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:57,510
Why not?

531
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:02,770
The forest people who died
years ago are now Jombies.

532
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:04,300
Zombies.

533
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,780
Jombies. Bloodthirsty,
the living dead.

534
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,310
Rotting corpses.

535
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:10,770
Like the plot?

536
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,130
Dreadful.

537
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:16,070
Those films have corrupted
your imagination.

538
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:23,940
"When Samina heard about Ramju,
fear gripped her heart.

539
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,720
"She had never seen him.

540
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:30,750
"But every scary face
reminded her of him.

541
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:34,090
"One day she finally met Ramju.

542
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:38,210
"She was buying mangoes
at the bus stop...

543
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:43,870
"...a young man in a white shirt
stopped near the stall.

544
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,710
"His face was all scared from
knife cuts.

545
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:00,630
Mr. Loknath, put them away.
Not allowed.

546
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:03,810
It's an old custom playing cards
at the booth.

547
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,100
So is getting suspended.

548
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:09,910
Another old custom:
fortune-telling. May I?

549
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,150
Cut the deck.

550
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,540
Go on. Don't be scared.

551
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,580
Let's see your future.

552
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:23,540
- Not on my table.
- Please wait

553
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,720
1, 2, 3

554
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,870
This card is your past.

555
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:31,100
This is your present.
And this is your future.

556
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:35,130
- Choose one.
- What are you doing?

557
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,860
Two of Hearts, you're kind-hearted
Pick another.

558
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:43,740
The joker.

559
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:45,580
That's you today.

560
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:47,540
A joker?

561
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:51,570
A joker could be anyone.

562
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:53,700
Enough!

563
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,580
Go and sit down.

564
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:00,620
Sure! Prophecies frighten people.

565
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:02,420
Put the cards away

566
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:06,220
Shambhu! Get up.

567
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:08,770
Go and freshen up.

568
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:16,620
Matches?

569
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:33,750
20 rupees

570
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,830
20? Wow!

571
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,660
You must have a good hand

572
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,400
20 from me.

573
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:44,380
No, friends.

574
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,160
What have you got?

575
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:54,170
There's nothing to do here.
Just kill time.

576
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:03,620
- What's the price of land here?
- Why? Building a house?

577
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,290
I want to invest.

578
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:08,150
- Surrender instead.
- Surrender?

579
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:11,540
Turn yourself in with a pistol,
you'll get 200,000 rupees.

580
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:16,250
Surrender with this, you'll
get 500,000.

581
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:19,680
With an AK-47, it's 1.5 million
rupees.

582
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:25,640
You find the guns. We'll do the rest
and split 50-50.

583
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,410
But I am not a Maoist.

584
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:30,570
The police know that.
That's why they'll pay you.

585
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,240
- Freshened up? It was quick.
- No choice.

586
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:38,800
- You should've washed your clothes too.
- There was no soap.

587
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,120
You washed your face without
soap?

588
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:43,830
You could've used the leaves
of the Ritha tree.

589
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,370
Didn't see it

590
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,920
Lakhma.

591
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,200
Where is Mr. Atma Singh?

592
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,950
- Where is Mr. Atma Singh?
- On a field exercise.

593
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:10,000
Great catch!

594
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:14,060
You'll have to run a kilometer.

595
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:15,970
How far are the settlements?

596
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:19,110
Shubham, help this gentleman.

597
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:26,360
One is behind the hill, 1.5km.
The other is 1km away.

598
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:32,490
They aren't showing up
because of the boycott.

599
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:35,380
Can you bring the voters here safely?

600
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,990
- That's impossible.
- Why?

601
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:42,160
I am the presiding officer. You must
obey my orders.

602
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:49,790
Yes, within 200m. Not beyond that.
We have our procedures too.

603
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:51,830
Hey Rajman.

604
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,500
No, thanks.

605
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:57,750
It's nothing personal.

606
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:01,010
Worried about zero voting?
I won't let that happen.

607
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,250
My men will vote.

608
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:04,740
Who wants to vote?

609
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:09,130
See? They are all keen.

610
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,280
Is that your idea? I won't allow
any cheating.

611
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:16,360
You talk about cheating.

612
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:18,930
There are almost 70 voters
in these villages.

613
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,500
Politicians? Not even a polling agent
has come.

614
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:25,180
No one from any Party.
And you talk about cheating.

615
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,150
I don't know about that.
I'm just doing my duty.

616
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:32,790
How old are you? I'm 40.
And you?

617
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,750
What's that got to do with it?

618
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:37,660
Just changing the subject.

619
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:40,610
OK

620
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:46,860
What is 2 plus 2, divided by 2?

621
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:49,410
Two?

622
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:51,820
Three.

623
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:54,640
You talk of rules and forget
the basic one.

624
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:57,790
Division comes before addition.

625
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:04,120
You won't send your men?

626
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,290
Sorry. Rules.

627
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:21,120
Mr. Newton, do you have
a motorcycle?

628
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:23,000
No

629
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,990
I'm buying one next month.
A Honda.

630
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:28,950
Can I ask you something?
Don't mind.

631
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:30,600
Go on.

632
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:37,410
Say you work the same hours,
but your salary doubles.

633
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,290
I don't take bribes.

634
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:43,080
You've got me wrong, sir.
There's a scheme.

635
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,740
Pay 500 rupees.

636
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:49,700
Then find ten others who pay
500 each.

637
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:55,540
You'll earn more with every new
member. A chain is created.

638
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,790
You'll mint money, sitting at home.

639
00:51:58,070 --> 00:52:03,080
The scheme guys will explain
everything over a free lunch.

640
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:05,580
Chicken and all sorts are served.

641
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:10,220
A lady from Sukma bought a Sony
phone in two months.

642
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,950
The touchscreen type.

643
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:14,830
We are all doing our duty

644
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:17,780
Atma Singh must have seen
other elections.

645
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,370
But these are different

646
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,250
I understand that.

647
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:24,200
Guys like him don't shake
without being shaken...

648
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:28,350
...but they don't stop once shaken.
He is a Jombie now.

649
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,100
Must I do nothing?

650
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:32,780
Let's none of us do anything

651
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:40,080
I've sprayed tons of repellent but
these bloodsuckers won't stop

652
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:42,350
I'm shivering.

653
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:46,450
They're local bloodsuckers.
Repellent is useless.

654
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:48,080
Try our remedy.

655
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:50,450
What?

656
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,200
You won't get malaria.

657
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:55,580
Will you make me eat herbs?

658
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:00,540
He had better not get cerebral malaria.
What's your remedy?

659
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:02,750
No, sir.

660
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,700
The bites will soon disappear.

661
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,850
What is she doing?

662
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:11,160
Must he chew the leaves?

663
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,160
An ant's nest. The ants must bite him.

664
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:15,470
- Bite whom?
- You.

665
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:19,950
They'll bite you and you'll sweat.
You won't get malaria.

666
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,750
Pull up your shirt.

667
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:24,860
No, no. I'm already sweating.
Sir, stop her!

668
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:28,540
- A few bites and you'll be ok.
- It'll save you from malaria.

669
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:30,600
It won't hurt.

670
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:41,540
Are they edible?

671
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,630
It's sour.

672
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:56,540
We make them into a chutney.
Very tasty.

673
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,120
Interesting.

674
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:01,880
What's interesting is that you live
a few hours away...

675
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:04,710
...yet know nothing about life here.

676
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,240
Is that someone singing?

677
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:30,370
- What's going on?
- Interrogation.

678
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:33,380
About what?

679
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:40,720
They were climbing trees,
playing.

680
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,170
They were spying to see how
many men we were.

681
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:48,210
"How many men?" You think you're
in an action movie like "Sholay?"

682
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,640
The Maoists even use toddlers.

683
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:54,080
Not true.

684
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,050
Who's asking you?

685
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,040
- You're one of them.
- One second.

686
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:01,210
You can't talk to her like that.

687
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:05,000
If they're spies, why make them
sing?

688
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:09,580
You prefer I beat them up?

689
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:13,990
- Ask them if they saw anything.
- No.

690
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:17,070
Hear that? The answer came out
like a shot.

691
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:19,480
Pretends he doesn't speak Hindi.

692
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:21,410
Hey Mowgli, come here.

693
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,650
What are you doing?

694
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:31,830
Go!

695
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,280
Tell everyone in the village
to come and vote. Go.

696
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:49,140
It's all for your benefit, sir.

697
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:52,350
You sound threatening.

698
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:54,950
Mr. Newton...

699
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:02,460
In uniform, a request sounds like
a threat.

700
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:05,610
They aren't your slaves

701
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:11,910
Newton, stay a Newton.

702
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,770
Don't try to be an Einstein.

703
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:18,440
We're leaving soon.

704
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:22,780
More ambushes at night.
Get back to your duty.

705
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:32,850
Let's go.

706
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:53,670
What time did we first meet
Atma Singh?

707
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:58,780
- Around 4:30 or 4:45am.
- 4:30 or 4:45?

708
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:01,780
Probably 4:45.

709
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:05,580
When did we leave?

710
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:08,290
Don't know.

711
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,160
I got there at 5:30.

712
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:15,830
Are you filing a complaint?

713
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:17,870
Why raise your blood pressure?

714
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,270
We know the elections mean
a lot to you.

715
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:26,750
But only one thing changes:
the framed portraits of our leaders.

716
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:34,150
Who cares if people starve or not,
voting is a more important right!

717
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,110
Are you a pessimist like him?

718
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,210
No. I'm an Adivasi,
a "tribal".

719
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:45,700
What's going on?

720
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:47,450
Go back to duty.

721
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,410
Run!

722
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:55,620
What a pain.

723
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:25,620
How did you end up in this jungle?
Couldn't pull any strings?

724
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:27,700
I wanted to sit in a helicopter.

725
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:30,800
- Mr. Newton, Digcent is on the line.
- Who?

726
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:32,160
The DIG, sir

727
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,220
Newton Kumar.

728
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,590
How many votes?

729
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:46,990
Zero votes.

730
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,590
It's not going well.
I tried telling Atma...

731
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:54,770
Hello. Listen to me.
The voters will come.

732
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,740
I spoke to Atma Singh

733
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,080
I'm on my way...

734
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:01,760
...with some foreign journalists.

735
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:04,700
Remember, my reputation is at stake
Clear?

736
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,410
Your WhatsApp profile is good

737
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:13,090
I thought you were blonde.

738
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:17,660
Krishna's unit will go down the hill.
My men will go the other way.

739
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:21,330
Mr. Newton, may we go?

740
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:28,200
Don't force anyone to come.
Let them come voluntarily.

741
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:32,090
Force them? Tell us and we'll
leave our guns here.

742
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:44,670
One unit stays here to protect
the booth.

743
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,080
Get up!

744
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:55,480
Move it.

745
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:00,440
Stop listening to their excuses.
Get them together in 5 minutes.

746
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:09,450
Where are you going?
Fill it up.

747
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:12,040
Hurry up!

748
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:20,080
- Do you know Hindi?
- A little.

749
01:02:20,810 --> 01:02:23,570
How many villagers have
voting cards?

750
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:29,050
- What's that?
- He says "40".

751
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:33,040
Tell him to bring his card
and convince the others. OK?

752
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,940
Do you have a voting card?

753
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,690
Card? Go and get it.

754
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,510
Cook the fat one. Make it spicy.

755
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:48,530
Do you have a voting card?

756
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:55,240
Come on!

757
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:01,150
Stop!

758
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:25,420
We're taking the voters with us.

759
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:35,670
Get going!

760
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:42,620
Do you know the history
of this place?

761
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:45,830
Dandakaranya Forest.

762
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:47,810
Know what it means?

763
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:53,160
"The Forest of Punishment."
Where it's given and served.

764
01:03:53,590 --> 01:03:56,410
Sita and Rama were exiled here

765
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:58,870
Surpanakha's nose was cut off here.

766
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,540
Sita crossed the line drawn
by Lakshman.

767
01:04:01,810 --> 01:04:05,970
She was kidnapped by Ravan
and taken to Sri Lanka.

768
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,700
Lots of history here.

769
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,480
You are too young to have seen
the TV serial Ramayana.

770
01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:15,870
The mythical aircraft, Pushpak?
It flew from here.

771
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:20,660
- From here?
- Yes. See that clearing?

772
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:23,200
Doesn't it look like a runway?

773
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:26,040
India's first pilot was Ravan.

774
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:27,970
Of Sri Lanka?

775
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,900
Sri Lanka and India were the same
country then.

776
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:34,680
He flew her straight to Sri Lanka.

777
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:54,860
What are you staring at?

778
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:47,270
People with a voting card,
raise your hands.

779
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:55,950
The ones with the card, go over there.
Only they can vote.

780
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,480
Where are the young?

781
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,700
Gone to pick Tendu leaves.

782
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,970
- When will they be back?
- By lunch.

783
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:07,580
Sit over there.

784
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:31,040
They're all old. Where are
the young ones?

785
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:35,110
They've gone to work.

786
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:37,330
We found this lot, so we
dragged them here.

787
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:39,290
- Dragged them here?
- No, sir.

788
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:42,650
They came voluntarily
The others have been informed.

789
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:44,250
They'll come after lunch.

790
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:48,950
Get in line.

791
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:52,000
Everyone, in line. Hurry

792
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:00,220
Malko, Loknath. Shall we start?

793
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:02,450
Go ahead, start.

794
01:07:10,370 --> 01:07:11,500
Name?

795
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:13,710
Sukku

796
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,620
Sukku Ram.

797
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:21,950
Number MZZ...

798
01:07:24,850 --> 01:07:25,880
Please come.

799
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:38,120
What's her name?

800
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:41,140
Komaldai.

801
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,050
Number 19.

802
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:05,430
Cast your vote.

803
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:11,230
What?

804
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:13,250
He's just standing there.

805
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,230
Maybe it's the first time he's seen
a machine.

806
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,230
Nor have his ancestors!

807
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,310
He's dumbstruck.

808
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,410
Listen to me carefully.

809
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:29,950
Cast your votes, one by one.

810
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:34,340
See this? A machine like this
is inside that room.

811
01:08:34,530 --> 01:08:36,190
The machine will register your vote.

812
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:39,800
There's a button next to
each candidate's name.

813
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:43,640
Press the button for the person
you want to vote for.

814
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:44,860
OK?

815
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:47,560
Please translate.

816
01:09:00,610 --> 01:09:02,480
- How much money do we get?
- Shut up!

817
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,710
Voting is your birthright.

818
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:11,240
You won't be paid. Nor will you
be forced to vote.

819
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,160
Understand?

820
01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:25,910
Any questions?

821
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:28,610
Don't be scared. Ask.

822
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:33,620
How does voting benefit them?

823
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:38,370
This is the country's biggest election.

824
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:44,040
Don't you want roads, electricity,
water and social justice?

825
01:09:44,790 --> 01:09:47,960
The man you vote for will make all
this happen.

826
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:51,330
He'll bring improvements.

827
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:06,830
"This jungle is more dangerous
than beautiful.

828
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,220
"We could be ambushed.

829
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:10,360
"An IED or a land mine could explode.

830
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:14,030
"So it's a big deal that elections are
being held under these circumstances.

831
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,550
"With cameraman Israr Ahmed

832
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:18,120
"I am Vinod for S News,
Kondanar."

833
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:25,100
Parliament is where important laws
of this land are passed.

834
01:10:25,290 --> 01:10:26,280
It's in Delhi.

835
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,800
The candidate you choose...

836
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:32,960
We have our own laws.
Thousands of years old.

837
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:36,260
Please cooperate and translate.

838
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:41,530
Tell them that the man they vote for
will go to Delhi.

839
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:59,140
They say he's their leader,
he can go to Delhi.

840
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:03,890
You can't go to Delhi, you aren't
standing in the elections.

841
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:06,280
Show them the list.

First time they've heard these names.

859
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:04,830
Which candidate will give them
a fair price for Tendu leaves?

860
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:16,260
They say if they vote, the Maoists
will trouble them...

861
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,040
...or the police will.
No one asks what they want.

862
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,010
What do they want?

863
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:25,050
Freedom from both.

864
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:27,600
Did they say that?

865
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:30,940
Sir, should I handle it?

866
01:12:31,370 --> 01:12:34,310
Loknath, two minutes. Let me explain
Two minutes.

867
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:37,120
After the elections...

868
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:40,800
Mr. Newton, this is beyond you.

869
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:42,140
Now let me take over.

870
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:47,170
Shame on you people!

871
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:50,120
These gentlemen have come
to this jungle...

872
01:12:50,290 --> 01:12:52,540
...risking their lives for you.

873
01:12:55,470 --> 01:12:57,060
What?

874
01:12:57,490 --> 01:12:58,200
Just wait.

875
01:12:58,390 --> 01:13:00,000
Must you treat them like this?

876
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:01,510
Please wait.

877
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:06,180
- The voting machine is like a toy.
- What nonsense! It is not a toy.

878
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:07,570
- What are you saying?
- Be quiet.

879
01:13:08,170 --> 01:13:10,120
- These are your first elections.
- So what?

880
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:13,760
You can't get their vote,
and obstruct others who can.

881
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:17,910
You're the obstructive one.
I will report you.

882
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:19,560
Go on. Write up your report.

883
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:21,480
Krishna, take him away.

884
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:25,320
This toy is easy to play with.

885
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:26,890
It has everything.

886
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:31,370
A carrot, a ship, a motorcycle,
an animal, a flower.

887
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:32,940
A mug.

888
01:13:33,170 --> 01:13:35,480
Press the button of the picture you like.

889
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:36,960
We're not children.

890
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:40,500
He's right. You can't talk to
them like that.

891
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,240
- Go away!
- Why?

892
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,270
I am the presiding officer.
I'm in control

893
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:46,720
I've heard that all day.

894
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:50,430
Control, what control?

895
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:04,450
He says, "I'm the Headman and
village judge. I'll settle your dispute".

896
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:05,770
You'll settle it?

897
01:14:16,170 --> 01:14:17,510
Please wait.

898
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:32,300
Start the procedure.

899
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:35,800
They're coming. We're running
out of time.

900
01:14:43,610 --> 01:14:47,370
A faraway destination.

901
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:53,340
A slow pace.

902
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:59,310
Flying dust.

903
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:05,380
Reddened eyes.

904
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:11,950
A long straight road.

905
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:16,470
Decided to turn its course.

906
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:23,440
Having seen you.

907
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:29,140
The bird has flown away.

908
01:16:03,570 --> 01:16:05,190
Ask your questions,
one by one.

909
01:16:09,970 --> 01:16:14,410
Some people say the atmosphere of fear
benefits the mining companies.

910
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:16,890
People will be displaced.
The companies will take over.

911
01:16:17,070 --> 01:16:19,850
That's what Maoist sympathizers say.

912
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:21,670
They are the root problem.

913
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:23,800
Did the administration burn
these villages?

914
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,050
Were you scared coming here?

915
01:16:31,390 --> 01:16:32,800
Sir, the Maoists...

916
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:35,110
...you talk about are forced
to surrender...

917
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:37,920
...and forced to fight other Maoists.
What's the logic?

918
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:40,980
Durjan. Tukaram. Come here!

919
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,970
Tell them - were these weapons
forced on you?

920
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:44,810
No, sir.

921
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:46,810
Did you put any pressure
on the villagers?

922
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:31,390
What do you hope for?
How will the elections change your life?

923
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:33,450
There'll be no change.

924
01:17:33,710 --> 01:17:36,490
- You don't think so?
- No, no change.

925
01:17:36,930 --> 01:17:38,100
Why not?

926
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:47,060
Somewhat united.

927
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:53,210
Mostly divided.

928
01:17:55,670 --> 01:17:59,500
Bursting with air.

929
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:05,190
The balloon burst.

930
01:18:07,670 --> 01:18:12,460
A new page stitched itself
into the story.

931
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:23,450
Having seen you.

932
01:18:24,910 --> 01:18:29,380
The bird has flown away.

933
01:18:31,710 --> 01:18:35,360
Who heard what?

934
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:41,110
Who said what?

935
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:46,640
It was a half-done night.

936
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:49,730
The final count?

937
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:53,140
39 out of 76.

938
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:57,650
We need to visit other booths.
How long will you stay?

939
01:18:59,010 --> 01:19:00,190
Till 3pm.

940
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:03,080
Why? Who's coming?

941
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:06,970
Some voters said they'd come
after lunch.

942
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:10,710
It wouldn't be right
if we left early.

943
01:19:11,190 --> 01:19:12,560
What if a voter shows up?

944
01:19:13,490 --> 01:19:14,800
There's still time.

945
01:19:18,910 --> 01:19:20,150
You've no idea what's going on
here.

946
01:19:20,350 --> 01:19:22,610
What do you mean? Violence?

947
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:25,850
- Booth capturing? Phony votes?
- No.

948
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:04,790
Elections have their charm

949
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:08,810
I'm glad this is my last.

950
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:12,300
This was no election.

951
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:17,150
Voting for anyone.
Is that an election?

952
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:20,810
So? You should've stopped it.

953
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:22,840
You saw. The procedure was
followed.

954
01:20:23,410 --> 01:20:27,090
You've been preaching all day.
Trying to teach people civics

955
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:30,260
Malko, let's eat.

956
01:20:30,610 --> 01:20:31,680
Mr. Loknath

957
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:35,340
I'm going.

958
01:20:35,650 --> 01:20:38,480
Never seen a specimen like you
in 30 years of duty. Come.

959
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,900
Mr. Newton, you're educated
and knowledgeable.

960
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:51,270
Don't mind if I say something.

961
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,970
What you saw today has been
our life.

962
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:11,320
Great change does not come in a day.
Even the jungle took years to grow.

963
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:24,600
You want to add something?

964
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:42,750
I have a solution to stop
the injustice here.

965
01:21:42,970 --> 01:21:44,010
- What's that?
- TV.

966
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,490
- TV?
- TV for everyone.

967
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:49,050
Greed means nothing to them.

968
01:21:49,490 --> 01:21:51,100
Greed is an alien concept.

969
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,390
They need TVs.

970
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:56,350
When they see Coca Cola
and washing machine ads...

971
01:21:56,650 --> 01:22:00,180
...they'll forget about the revolution
and fall in line.

972
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,000
Wow! You're quite the intellectual.

973
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:06,760
Can anyone stop the sun
from rising?

974
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:11,020
Red salad!

975
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:15,740
Food for everyone.

976
01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:18,780
- What is it?
- A local recipe.

977
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:22,090
Won't madam eat with us?

978
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:24,280
She's sulking.

979
01:22:26,190 --> 01:22:28,780
Ask these boys to vote.

980
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:32,550
They're not even 16.

981
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:35,780
The first time I voted
I was 14.

982
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,320
Back home, teenagers pass off
as candidates.

983
01:22:38,610 --> 01:22:41,350
- Where's home?
- Never mind.

984
01:22:42,770 --> 01:22:44,180
How is the chicken?

985
01:22:45,150 --> 01:22:46,600
It's from a kilometer away

986
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:49,200
Lakhma!

987
01:23:36,150 --> 01:23:38,540
As per the rules, I can't come in.

988
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:41,330
Feel bad seeing you like this.

989
01:23:43,670 --> 01:23:47,570
The situation was beyond our control.
We both had a job to do

990
01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:51,280
I'd feel guilty if you didn't eat.

991
01:23:59,110 --> 01:24:00,220
What was that?

992
01:24:01,210 --> 01:24:02,410
Don't move. Stay put!

993
01:24:08,030 --> 01:24:09,130
- What happened?
- Hurry!

994
01:24:12,290 --> 01:24:13,290
Stay down.

995
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:14,560
Sir, it's an ambush.

996
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:17,670
Take your stuff and go.

997
01:24:19,550 --> 01:24:20,470
Hurry up!

998
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:25,490
Take them to the highway.

999
01:24:25,610 --> 01:24:28,210
Mr. Newton, take the machine.
They're attacking us.

1000
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:34,780
Come out, hurry.

1001
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:42,100
Krishna's men will take you
to the highway.

1002
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:43,800
Thank you.

1003
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:46,570
Krishna, go!

1004
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:43,900
This path will lead you home.

1005
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:45,740
- Will you manage?
- Yes.

1006
01:25:45,990 --> 01:25:47,810
How will she go?
We'll take her home.

1007
01:25:47,990 --> 01:25:49,320
No, sir, I can manage.

1008
01:25:49,530 --> 01:25:51,040
We can take you back.

1009
01:25:51,570 --> 01:25:54,530
She'll be fine. I can send someone
with her.

1010
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:56,150
There's no need.

1011
01:25:56,470 --> 01:25:57,530
There's no need. I'll go.

1012
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,330
- Sure.
- Yes.

1013
01:26:02,630 --> 01:26:04,030
Here's the register

1014
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:08,110
Malko ma'am, keep this pen.

1015
01:26:08,850 --> 01:26:10,310
How will you turn your pupils
into tigers?

1016
01:26:11,170 --> 01:26:14,300
See? Sir's third card of fortune.
A five.

1017
01:26:14,890 --> 01:26:15,790
It's useless.

1018
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:18,990
A king, queen or ace is good.

1019
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:22,810
No, Mr. Loknath. This is a five.

1020
01:26:27,190 --> 01:26:28,710
And this is six.

1021
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:32,870
She means the sixth sense.

1022
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:34,650
She's explaining it to you.

1023
01:26:34,930 --> 01:26:36,470
That's if he can understand.

1024
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:40,020
Ok, sir.

1025
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,980
Mr. Loknath, you're a writer, right?

1026
01:27:24,580 --> 01:27:27,070
What do you think of the story
we were told?

1027
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:29,370
Story? What story?

1028
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:34,990
At first they said it was unsafe.
We shouldn't come.

1029
01:27:37,030 --> 01:27:38,680
When we got here,
it seemed safe to me.

1030
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,070
No one came to vote at first.

1031
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:44,880
As soon as the media showed up,
so did the voters.

1032
01:27:48,990 --> 01:27:50,710
They said leave after tea.

1033
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:52,440
Then it was - leave after lunch.

1034
01:27:54,030 --> 01:27:57,050
An ambush takes place as soon
as lunch is over.

1035
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:00,700
Intriguing story, no?

1036
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:04,450
I should write it up.

1037
01:28:07,190 --> 01:28:08,000
Krishna.

1038
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:11,810
- A good story?
- Meaning, sir? I don't get it.

1039
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,020
Let's keep walking.

1040
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:17,790
There was a dangerous ambush.

1041
01:28:18,150 --> 01:28:20,150
But no message to say
all is well.

1042
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:23,450
Sir, I'll just check.

1043
01:28:26,310 --> 01:28:27,900
Where did all the curry go?

1044
01:28:29,310 --> 01:28:30,610
Come along, sir.

1045
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:34,480
Sir, please come.

1046
01:28:43,590 --> 01:28:44,870
Stop, sir.

1047
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:57,450
Where are you going, sir?

1048
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:04,340
Sir, why are you screwing up your job?

1049
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:09,030
Sir, let's talk.

1050
01:29:11,590 --> 01:29:15,750
Don't make me run.
If I have to run, I'll thrash you.

1051
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:20,140
Don't make me run!

1052
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:28,400
What is this nonsense?

1053
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:53,710
Where to?

1054
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:55,860
The booth.

1055
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:57,470
At it again?

1056
01:31:45,070 --> 01:31:46,650
You're a fraud.

1057
01:32:33,510 --> 01:32:34,700
They're back

1058
01:32:43,340 --> 01:32:45,750
I've caught the ghost.
Let's go.

1059
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:24,070
What are you doing?

1060
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:26,520
I'm here to vote.

1061
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:30,400
No. There is no voting here.

1062
01:33:31,110 --> 01:33:34,150
- No.
- There are only four of them.

1063
01:33:36,070 --> 01:33:37,180
Get rid of them.

1064
01:33:39,490 --> 01:33:40,980
Please wait.

1065
01:33:41,230 --> 01:33:42,420
Stop!

1066
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:54,680
Put that gun down!

1067
01:33:57,030 --> 01:33:59,110
Have you gone mad?

1068
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:00,630
Put it down!

1069
01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:02,670
It might go off by accident.

1070
01:34:04,590 --> 01:34:05,490
Put your guns down!

1071
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:07,570
Down, I said.

1072
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:10,720
Down!

1073
01:34:17,530 --> 01:34:20,470
Wait. Nothing will happen to you.
Cast your vote.

1074
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:22,910
Mr. Loknath, set up the booth.

1075
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:25,230
Everyone, get back.

1076
01:34:27,450 --> 01:34:29,960
Set up the machine. Get their votes.

1077
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:31,880
Go on. Get it done.

1078
01:34:34,490 --> 01:34:37,730
You want them to vote. So go.

1079
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:41,600
Put the machine here.

1080
01:34:42,670 --> 01:34:45,150
- Know how to sign?
- Yes.

1081
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:47,620
- Your name?
- Trilok.

1082
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:49,990
Check their voting cards.

1083
01:34:53,110 --> 01:34:55,170
Put the gun down.
You'll lose your job.

1084
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:59,980
Let's talk it over.
We're on the same side.

1085
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:01,170
- Put it down.
- Shut up!

1086
01:35:01,530 --> 01:35:03,900
Election officers don't look good
with guns.

1087
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:05,460
Get back.

1088
01:35:06,610 --> 01:35:07,820
Back!

1089
01:35:12,030 --> 01:35:13,800
OK

1090
01:35:15,070 --> 01:35:16,940
- Start the process.
- Yes.

1091
01:35:19,610 --> 01:35:21,400
Sign here.

1092
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:25,740
- What's your name?
- Chandani.

1093
01:35:25,950 --> 01:35:27,440
- Know who you're voting for?
- Yes.

1094
01:35:27,610 --> 01:35:29,070
Don't need to tell me.

1095
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:34,610
Why did you fake an ambush?

1096
01:35:35,990 --> 01:35:38,090
- Why?
- Did I have a choice?

1097
01:35:39,090 --> 01:35:41,700
I've been telling you all day -
this area is unsafe.

1098
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:46,600
We've asked for night vision goggles
for 2 years.

1099
01:35:47,330 --> 01:35:48,950
Brave men are dying.

1100
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:51,010
Can't take a risk for your
election picnic.

1101
01:35:51,130 --> 01:35:52,130
It's not a picnic.

1102
01:35:54,650 --> 01:35:55,950
It's my duty.

1103
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:08,970
Mr. Loknath.

1104
01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:10,920
- Done?
- Yes.

1105
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:13,070
You can leave now.

1106
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:15,290
Let's take the stuff.

1107
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,040
Step back!

1108
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:33,260
Sign here.

1109
01:36:35,970 --> 01:36:37,360
Two minutes to go.

1110
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:40,150
Two minutes to 3. Wait.

1111
01:36:45,530 --> 01:36:49,370
Take your time. Let's wait.

1112
01:36:51,530 --> 01:36:53,410
Have they left?

1113
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:56,400
Did they cast their vote?

1114
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:40,400
A pen.

1115
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:47,200
Take your time. We won't budge.

1116
01:37:49,450 --> 01:37:51,870
- Stay still.
- There's no hurry.

1117
01:37:54,530 --> 01:37:56,060
Take your time.

1118
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:05,900
OK?

1119
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:08,220
Done?

1120
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:19,560
Ok. Shall I take the gun?

1121
01:39:12,610 --> 01:39:14,340
Your total is 3450 rupees.

1122
01:39:15,070 --> 01:39:17,700
Wait. Let's do something.

1123
01:39:17,950 --> 01:39:20,190
We'll buy the olive oil next month.

1124
01:39:20,490 --> 01:39:23,620
No, no. Take it now.

1125
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:36,820
Where is Newton Kumar?

1126
01:39:37,110 --> 01:39:38,400
That way

1127
01:39:51,860 --> 01:39:52,830
Newton sir!

1128
01:39:54,050 --> 01:39:57,780
- What happened to your neck?
- Malko! Please come.

1129
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:01,560
What brings you here?

1130
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:05,850
I had some work. I heard you
worked here too.

1131
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:07,950
What happened to your neck?

1132
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:11,860
A reaction to my action.

1133
01:40:12,470 --> 01:40:15,110
It's much better now. I wear this
for safety.

1134
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:18,900
- And how are you?
- Fine.

1135
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:20,440
How is your school?

1136
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:22,300
The school is fine too.

1137
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:24,950
What about you?

1138
01:40:25,650 --> 01:40:27,490
You can see.

1139
01:40:31,990 --> 01:40:33,410
I got an award for punctuality.

1140
01:40:36,490 --> 01:40:37,530
Wow!

1141
01:40:37,950 --> 01:40:39,700
The department awarded you?

1142
01:40:39,890 --> 01:40:41,990
You see I'm always on time.

1143
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:44,060
The office starts at nine,
and I'm here on the dot.

1144
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:45,700
People think it's a big deal.

1145
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:47,450
Hence the award.

1146
01:40:47,990 --> 01:40:51,240
Sir, an honest officer should
be awarded.

1147
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:55,070
Don't know about honesty.
I'm just doing my duty.

1148
01:40:56,030 --> 01:40:59,280
An award for honesty involves
the greatest dishonesty.

1149
01:41:01,550 --> 01:41:04,700
- The election has changed you a lot.
- No

1150
01:41:04,990 --> 01:41:07,080
I haven't changed one bit.
I'm just the same.

1151
01:41:09,070 --> 01:41:10,890
Was everything ok after I left?

1152
01:41:11,700 --> 01:41:15,330
A long story. I'll tell you over tea
some day.

1153
01:41:15,450 --> 01:41:16,640
Let's have tea now.

1154
01:41:20,090 --> 01:41:22,460
Five minutes before the next break.
Can you wait?

1155
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:23,450
Yes.

1156
01:41:23,650 --> 01:41:25,490
Let me finish this.

1157
01:41:36,070 --> 01:41:37,190
I am glad you came.
