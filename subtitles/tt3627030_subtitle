00:01:03,788 --> 00:01:06,222
One fine morning...

4
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,819
Where's my spectacles, Saraswathi?

5
00:01:10,328 --> 00:01:11,955
See, next to the phone.

6
00:01:20,905 --> 00:01:23,567
<i>To my dear father,</i>
<i>your son Madhav,</i>

7
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,902
<i>when you read this letter, my face</i>
<i>must appear like in old films,</i>

8
00:01:29,781 --> 00:01:31,248
<i>sorry dad, forget it,</i>
<i>if it doesn't appear,</i>

9
00:01:31,449 --> 00:01:34,350
<i>when you read this,</i>
<i>l'll be dead,</i>

10
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,179
<i>l won't write like that,</i>

11
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,691
<i>for my mistake you beat mother,</i>
<i>it hurt me a lot, father,</i>

12
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:46,091
<i>l've left behind the watch, cell phone</i>
<i>and bracelet you bought for me,</i>

13
00:01:46,297 --> 00:01:49,095
<i>but one thing, l've taken the SlM card,</i>
<i>it has my personal numbers, right?</i>

14
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,997
<i>l had decided to leave this place</i>
<i>but l don't have money,</i>

15
00:01:55,206 --> 00:01:57,106
<i>then l got an idea, dad!</i>

16
00:01:57,308 --> 00:01:58,206
What could it be?

17
00:02:01,946 --> 00:02:05,006
<i>Mother, you save money in the charity</i>
<i>box when dad and l are there,</i>

18
00:02:05,216 --> 00:02:06,774
<i>so l broke it open,</i>

19
00:02:06,985 --> 00:02:10,250
<i>now l know you break it open</i>
<i>when we are not there,</i> - Why?

20
00:02:15,827 --> 00:02:18,227
<i>after that l came to take</i>
<i>the bureau keys,</i>

21
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,530
<i>you were alert even in sleep,</i>

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,230
<i>but dad was totally flat,</i>

23
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,697
<i>grandfather's property belongs</i>
<i>to grandson, right?</i>

24
00:02:25,903 --> 00:02:27,302
<i>That's why l took the ring.</i>

25
00:02:27,905 --> 00:02:31,705
Madhav, my son!
Where did you go away?

26
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,446
You wouldn't mind if l ask
you some thing, right?

27
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:51,144
Go ahead.

28
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,288
Train stopped in the station
for 10 minutes,

29
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,514
you too were standing
for 10 minutes,

30
00:03:53,725 --> 00:03:56,853
why did you get into train
running risking your life?

31
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,886
l'm the hero of this film.

32
00:03:59,097 --> 00:04:01,292
Opening scene, just a build up.

33
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:04,762
You wouldn't mind if l ask
you something now, right?

34
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:05,435
Go ahead.

35
00:04:05,636 --> 00:04:07,126
100s of passengers get in
and get down,

36
00:04:07,338 --> 00:04:09,670
why are you asking only me
leaving all others?

37
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:10,465
Who are you sir?

38
00:04:10,675 --> 00:04:11,664
l'm the director of this film.

39
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,673
Debut film, so little build up.

Do you've a match box, Swami?

42
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:40,860
Do you've a cigarette?

43
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:46,024
- Flashback?
- Yeah!

44
00:04:59,577 --> 00:05:00,475
Try to understand me, Sumathi.

45
00:05:00,678 --> 00:05:02,009
What should l do now?

46
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:03,475
Please love!

47
00:05:05,883 --> 00:05:08,875
l'm talking to you, stop Sumathi.

48
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:10,179
lf it's you okay,

49
00:05:10,388 --> 00:05:12,447
you're educated, wealthy,
and handsome too,

50
00:05:12,657 --> 00:05:15,217
but please don't support
your friend,

51
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,154
what does he have?

52
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,225
<i>He loves you deeply.</i>
<i>Look at him.</i>

53
00:05:18,429 --> 00:05:19,919
l hate to see him.

54
00:05:20,131 --> 00:05:22,725
Why are you so harsh?
He's in love with you for 3 years.

55
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:25,869
We both belong to different religions,
no way we can adjust.

56
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,001
- What's this buddy?
- Please...

57
00:05:31,142 --> 00:05:35,738
Sumathi, even birds too love,

58
00:05:35,947 --> 00:05:40,111
but religion, only humans follow it.

59
00:05:47,658 --> 00:05:50,252
- lsn't this dialogue comes in the film,
'Poove Unakkaaga', buddy?- Yes.

60
00:05:50,461 --> 00:05:52,361
What's the reason for liking
me so much?

61
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,761
Look, you can cite 1000 reasons
for hating someone,

62
00:05:56,968 --> 00:06:00,631
but you can't say even one
reason for loving someone.

63
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,231
Buddy...isn't it from 'Love Today'?

64
00:06:04,442 --> 00:06:06,103
She's not falling for any dialogue.

65
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,470
Sumathi, wait.

66
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:11,077
One remembers still the
alphabets learnt at age 5,

67
00:06:11,282 --> 00:06:15,480
how can he forget suddenly
the girl he loves at 20?

68
00:06:16,621 --> 00:06:18,248
This is from film, 'Nee Varuvayena'.

69
00:06:18,456 --> 00:06:21,425
Did you see? He's quoting from
the films produced by his company.

70
00:06:21,793 --> 00:06:24,091
lmpossible, Madhav.
Tell him to forget me.

71
00:06:24,595 --> 00:06:26,825
Ask him to die,
he'll do it immediately.

72
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:29,825
But if you ask him to forget,
what can he do?

73
00:06:30,535 --> 00:06:31,763
Think over it again.

74
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:40,340
Madhav, if you don't have this talking power,
you'd go to the dogs.

75
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:43,105
That's okay, but what have
you decided now?

76
00:06:44,248 --> 00:06:47,046
- No other way...
- That means?

77
00:06:48,052 --> 00:06:49,019
l accept.

78
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:49,909
Yes!

79
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:52,180
Hey, your matter is okay,
come here.

80
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,220
He's flying!

81
00:06:53,524 --> 00:06:54,354
Thanks.

82
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:55,685
That's for me!

83
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:56,689
Sorry buddy!

84
00:06:57,061 --> 00:06:58,028
That's for her!

85
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,026
Be careful!

86
00:07:00,631 --> 00:07:01,256
This is a temple.

87
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:05,033
- Buddy...you're great.
- Give me a five!

88
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:06,531
- Did a greatjob?
- Hi five!

89
00:07:07,238 --> 00:07:09,297
Where did you learn
to speak like this?

90
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,531

This is my family matter.
Don't interfere in it.

Hello, your sister is family matter,
but love is public matter,

151
00:12:15,346 --> 00:12:20,147
look, l delivered punch dialogues,
with chorus and song,

152
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,842
to unite the lovers,
try to understand...

153
00:12:29,326 --> 00:12:31,760
- Hack them..
- Bring back our sister.

154
00:12:31,962 --> 00:12:32,792
Attack boys!

155
00:12:33,998 --> 00:12:34,726

When did this happen?

157
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,459
Buddy, when you were dancing solo
in the lengthy BGM,

158
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:44,804
we too...then...played a game.

159
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,101
What's your decision now?

160
00:12:47,311 --> 00:12:48,869
Let bygones be bygones.

161
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:52,071
The matter has come to morning sickness,
boys will not listen to me.

162
00:12:52,283 --> 00:12:55,309
We've paid them each Rs.100, a biryani
and a quarter bottle whisky.

163
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,349
For that?

164
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,719
lf you've a small fight, boys and
audience, both will be happy.

165
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:03,449
lt's getting late,
tell them to come.

166
00:13:03,661 --> 00:13:04,389
Gym boys!

167
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:39,088
- Buddy, they're chasing to hit us.
- Will they come to fondle you then?

168
00:13:39,930 --> 00:14:28,968
<font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=DARKORANGE size=40> Z!@ <font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=BLUE size=40> ~  <font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=GREEN size=40> Am@n

169
00:14:29,913 --> 00:14:30,641
Pick it up!

170
00:14:32,316 --> 00:14:33,544
- Give me.
- You'll hit me if l give.

171
00:14:33,751 --> 00:14:34,308
Give me l say.

172
00:14:43,193 --> 00:14:43,955
Daddy!

173
00:14:44,161 --> 00:14:46,721
- Why did you stop? Hit me too!
- l must manage him.

174
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:53,963
l'm not asking you to work
and look after this family.

175
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:56,662
Can't you atleast stop bringing
bad name to me?

176
00:14:57,374 --> 00:15:00,434
People are asking me,
what is your son doing?

177
00:15:00,944 --> 00:15:02,241
What should l tell them?

178
00:15:03,547 --> 00:15:04,707
That's what l'm doing, father.

179
00:15:04,915 --> 00:15:05,745
What work?

180
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,381
Working about what to do.

181
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,183
Aren't you ashamed
to be a free loader?

182
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:18,521
Mother, served me every variety of food,
what is this free loader?

183
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:20,428
ls it for dad only?

184
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:22,690
Can't you keep your tongue
in control?

185
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:24,534
Where's the watch?

186
00:15:27,805 --> 00:15:29,204
What?

187
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,972
- lt's there.
- lt's there? Where?

188
00:15:33,844 --> 00:15:37,712
- What's the time?
- 9.10!

189
00:15:38,082 --> 00:15:39,709
Tell me correctly, 9 or 10?

190
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:42,545
9.10 means 10 minutes past nine.

191
00:15:42,753 --> 00:15:44,482
How can a watchman
be without a watch?

192
00:15:45,255 --> 00:15:47,314
- Keep it, enjoy!
- But for you...?

193
00:15:47,624 --> 00:15:50,058
l'm youth, l can work hard
and buy a new one.

194
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,551
Who? You...?

195
00:15:53,864 --> 00:15:55,729
l've been seeing for 25 years.

196
00:15:55,933 --> 00:15:58,401
Dad, l'm also seeing you
since l was born.

197
00:15:58,669 --> 00:16:00,830
- Both are same.
- Change this first.

198
00:16:01,038 --> 00:16:02,062
Don't change the topic.

199
00:16:02,272 --> 00:16:04,740
Look, a hanky around neck
like a goon.

200
00:16:04,942 --> 00:16:08,070
Dad, when people like you use
a napkin on shoulders, it's honour,

201
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:12,078
if youngmen like me keep a hanky
for sweat, is it hooliganism?

202
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:15,675
Don't try to convince me,
you brought a new bike,

203
00:16:16,053 --> 00:16:18,419
you cleanly wiped it yesterday too,
where is it now?

204
00:16:19,156 --> 00:16:23,252
- Dad...it is there.
- But where is it, son?

205
00:16:24,862 --> 00:16:26,090
Are you fine?

206
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:36,598
Greetings brother.

207
00:16:42,546 --> 00:16:43,672
Hey you stop it!

208
00:16:44,148 --> 00:16:45,843
- You tie the knot.
- Shut your mouth.

209
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:47,846
- What happened, son-in-law?
- My foot!

210
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:49,678
You promised to buy a new bike
before marriage,

211
00:16:49,953 --> 00:16:50,681
where is the bike?

212
00:16:50,888 --> 00:16:53,015
l've done everything you
asked except the bike,

213
00:16:53,223 --> 00:16:54,019
can't you adjust a little?

214
00:16:54,224 --> 00:16:56,784
Adjust a little?
No front wheel?

215
00:16:56,994 --> 00:16:58,689
- Not that...
- Not even that too?

216
00:16:58,896 --> 00:16:59,453
Useless lndian!

217
00:16:59,663 --> 00:17:02,029
All l want now is bike.
Only then she'll be my wife.

218
00:17:02,232 --> 00:17:03,859
After that only we'll have a life.

219
00:17:04,168 --> 00:17:06,864
ls it time to deliver punch dialogues?
First tie the knot.

220
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,367
Who will give me the bike then?

221
00:17:08,572 --> 00:17:11,541
Take my bike.
l'll buy a ladder too.

222
00:17:12,075 --> 00:17:12,700
Why a ladder?

223
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,140
For your height,
shouldn't you sit on the bike?

224
00:17:16,847 --> 00:17:17,313
Take my bike

225
00:17:21,752 --> 00:17:24,880
He lost his life for a bike!

226
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:31,225
Madhav, you're doing too much.

227
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:32,957
You too are at this age.

228
00:17:34,097 --> 00:17:35,894
l told you to withdraw
Rs.100 thousands from bank,

229
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:36,895
where's the money?

230
00:17:37,668 --> 00:17:38,999
Mom, l'm hungry.

231
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,900
Just now we ate together.

232
00:17:43,006 --> 00:17:43,995
What?

233
00:17:45,275 --> 00:17:46,503
Spent the money?

234
00:17:47,444 --> 00:17:50,413
- No, dad...
- Oh God!

235
00:17:51,215 --> 00:17:53,513
- How is the bike?
- Super sir!

236
00:17:54,051 --> 00:17:55,916
- Wife at home?
- She's a big torture!

237
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:59,247
Torture means...
does she beat you with utensils?

238
00:17:59,456 --> 00:18:01,321
No, she uses broom, slippers,

239
00:18:01,692 --> 00:18:03,319
pours cow dung mixed water
on my head,

240
00:18:03,694 --> 00:18:06,094
- and spits on my face.
- On face?

241
00:18:06,296 --> 00:18:08,161
She serves me dog's left over food.

242
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:10,094
Your life had really become
a dog's life.

243
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,929
Bridal dress hasn't yet got crumpled
but she has made me cry many times.

244
00:18:14,972 --> 00:18:15,597
She too calls me like that only.

245
00:18:15,806 --> 00:18:17,774
- Would you like to have a tea?
- Let's have breakfast sir.

246
00:18:19,476 --> 00:18:20,773
Three teas please.

247
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:22,769
Why? We are two only.

248
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,947
Two for me.

249
00:18:27,718 --> 00:18:32,280
lt's raining! People are happy!

250
00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:37,952
Hello!

251
00:18:38,829 --> 00:18:39,625
Who is it sir?

252
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,956
Hello...here!

253
00:18:41,398 --> 00:18:42,126
Tell me sir.

254
00:18:42,499 --> 00:18:46,560
Nothing, you're a big group,
don't you've homes to stay?

255
00:18:46,837 --> 00:18:50,295
We've credit card, ration card,
and vote card too.

256
00:18:50,507 --> 00:18:52,134
- But no home to stay, sir.
- Why?

257
00:18:52,342 --> 00:18:53,809
They gave all this voluntarily.

258
00:18:54,011 --> 00:18:55,478
But we are asking for homes,
but they're not giving.

259
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,976
How much you need
to build homes?

260
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,647
All we need is a thatched hut.

261
00:18:58,849 --> 00:19:01,374
- Cost of building a thatched hut?
- Rs.10000 sir.

262
00:19:03,854 --> 00:19:04,821
How many families?

263
00:19:05,689 --> 00:19:07,919
Totally ten families, l've two sir!

264
00:19:17,034 --> 00:19:19,832
Take it, build a home where all
of you can stay together.

265
00:19:20,037 --> 00:19:21,163
l mustn't see you homeless
next time.

266
00:19:21,371 --> 00:19:22,668
l'll garland you sir.

267
00:19:22,973 --> 00:19:25,237
Should l've demanded car
instead of a bike?

268
00:19:25,442 --> 00:19:28,172
Look at MGR!

269
00:19:28,378 --> 00:19:30,608
lt'll take just a second
to give charity.

270
00:19:30,981 --> 00:19:33,347
But it'll take years to earn it.

271
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,776
Think over it again.

272
00:19:37,788 --> 00:19:38,686
What are you doing?

273
00:19:39,556 --> 00:19:40,352
Thinking over it again, dad.

274
00:19:40,557 --> 00:19:42,752
You're a young man now,

275
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:47,963
did you ever buy me or your mother
new clothes for a festival?

276
00:19:48,398 --> 00:19:49,524
Why are you like this?

277
00:19:49,733 --> 00:19:51,360
When people ask me,
what is your son doing?

278
00:19:51,735 --> 00:19:53,965
- l feel ashamed to answer them.
- ls it?

279
00:19:54,237 --> 00:19:56,296
Yesterday l met uncle Govindaraj,

280
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,766
he asked me,
what is your father doing?

281
00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:00,037
l didn't feel any shame.

282
00:20:01,078 --> 00:20:04,980
Hubby, he's our only child,
why are you always scolding him?

283
00:20:05,182 --> 00:20:07,650
Madhav, l prepared your
favourite pudding.

284
00:20:07,851 --> 00:20:11,048
What l'm doing here and
what you're doing?

285
00:20:11,722 --> 00:20:33,066
<font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=DARKORANGE size=40> Z!@ <font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=BLUE size=40> ~  <font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=GREEN size=40> Am@n

286
00:20:34,277 --> 00:20:36,074
That's the end of flashback, right?

287
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,746
Yeah!

288
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:44,250
- What do you do?
- l'm a swami!

289
00:20:45,389 --> 00:20:47,084
Why are you looking here and
there while speaking to me?

290
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,154
l'm without!

291
00:20:49,192 --> 00:20:50,750
- Where are you coming from?
- Rameshwaram.

292
00:20:51,128 --> 00:20:53,756
Did you use Pamban bridge
or Rama's bridge?

293
00:20:53,964 --> 00:20:55,261
No politics please.

294
00:20:55,465 --> 00:20:56,932
This is not politics,
general knowledge.

295
00:20:57,134 --> 00:21:00,934
From toothpaste to the
mosquito repellent,

296
00:21:01,138 --> 00:21:01,934
there's politics in everything.

297
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:04,107
lf you or me don't talk about it,
who will discuss it then?

298
00:21:04,307 --> 00:21:05,171
No comments.

299
00:21:05,475 --> 00:21:06,271
Give me a hand shake.

300
00:21:06,643 --> 00:21:08,270
Very good, congratulations,
thank you.

301
00:21:08,478 --> 00:21:09,672
Bloody nasty man!

302
00:21:11,515 --> 00:21:12,607
- Price of chapati?
- Rs.10 sir.

303
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:16,075
- Can l get it for Rs.2?
- Rs.2? You'll get a water sachet only.

304
00:21:16,386 --> 00:21:19,446
lf you don't have money,
go to toilet, water is free there.

305
00:21:20,323 --> 00:21:21,620
Thanks for your advice, boss.

306
00:21:22,092 --> 00:21:24,117
You're a young man,
why are you starving?

307
00:21:24,828 --> 00:21:26,455
Pay Rs.10 and have it.

308
00:21:26,663 --> 00:21:29,632
- Not for me, Swami.
- Why were you bargaining then?

309
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,300
- For you only!
- For me? Why?

310
00:21:31,501 --> 00:21:33,560
l had your food in the
previous station, swami.

311
00:21:34,438 --> 00:21:36,963
- Shocked for this? Look here!
- Ticket please.

Kalikambal Temple, Chennai

314
00:23:14,471 --> 00:23:17,269
One, two, three...

315
00:23:19,543 --> 00:23:20,271
Eleven...

316
00:23:22,712 --> 00:23:23,736
What are you looking at, Lord?

317
00:23:24,181 --> 00:23:25,739
For cheating in offering coconuts?

318
00:23:26,516 --> 00:23:27,676
Economically weak.

319
00:23:33,657 --> 00:23:34,851
Everyone should be fine.

320
00:23:35,792 --> 00:23:36,850
l'll not wish that.

321
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,359
Because you know who is good
and who is bad in tie world,

322
00:23:40,664 --> 00:23:44,430
l know that you know
l'm a very good man.

323
00:23:44,634 --> 00:23:47,262
lf man is not in trouble,
no prayers for God.

324
00:23:47,737 --> 00:23:49,295
Though a girl saved my life,

325
00:23:49,806 --> 00:23:53,708
l believe that it was you who came
in churidhar to save me.

326
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:54,535
<i>Thank you.</i>

327
00:23:55,078 --> 00:23:56,204
l've two desires.

328
00:23:56,413 --> 00:23:58,540
Number one,
l want to see the girl again,

329
00:23:59,082 --> 00:24:00,709
number two,
l got to get a job.

330
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:02,885
l don't know if you know
English or not,

331
00:24:03,086 --> 00:24:07,887
just now a Marwari devotee came,
it means you know Hindi too.

332
00:24:08,091 --> 00:24:08,557
<i>Good logic!</i>

338
00:24:22,939 --> 00:24:25,999
Won't there be a fool here
to offer me a job?

339
00:24:33,717 --> 00:24:35,742
He bursts crackers for anything from
going to work to using toilet,

340
00:24:35,952 --> 00:24:37,351

341
00:24:41,391 --> 00:24:44,087
Thank God, l'm wearing trouser,

342
00:24:45,795 --> 00:24:48,263
Who is he?
Strolling before my house.

343
00:24:48,465 --> 00:24:49,762
Looks new to the town.

344
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:50,933
Hey man!

345
00:24:51,234 --> 00:24:55,762
Hey you! What are you looking
around the tree?

346
00:24:55,972 --> 00:24:56,438
What's the matter?

347
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,607
What is the matter?

348
00:24:59,142 --> 00:25:00,939
Why are you observing me intently?

349
00:25:01,144 --> 00:25:02,611
Who are you?
What are you going to do?

350
00:25:04,147 --> 00:25:05,444
l'm going to hang myself.

351
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:07,707
Hang yourself?

352
00:25:08,051 --> 00:25:10,952
Why are you saying it simple
like chewing betel nuts?

353
00:25:11,154 --> 00:25:14,521
Didn't you find any other tree
to hang yourself?

354
00:25:14,824 --> 00:25:16,291
Don't disturb me, go away.

355
00:25:16,493 --> 00:25:18,961
Am l disturbing you?
The tree is opposite to my home.

356
00:25:19,162 --> 00:25:21,562
lf you hang yourself to death,
police will inquire me.

357
00:25:21,765 --> 00:25:23,960
Why should l bother if anybody
inquires you after l'm dead?

358
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:25,634
l'm in good mood,
please go away.

359
00:25:25,835 --> 00:25:28,804
Are you in good mood?
You say as if it's your first night.

360
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:32,463
- Please don't disturb me, go away.
- Listen to me...don't do it.

361
00:25:33,677 --> 00:25:34,302
What?

362
00:25:35,845 --> 00:25:38,541
Would l leave if you bribe
with a tenner?

363
00:25:38,748 --> 00:25:40,215
Why should l leave this tenner too?

364
00:25:40,517 --> 00:25:42,144
What if l take it and
chase him away?

365
00:25:42,352 --> 00:25:45,150

He's standing on my back!
No...l'll not leave you.

367
00:25:49,192 --> 00:25:50,659

368
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,657
- l'm asking you to get down.
- No, l'll not.

369
00:25:52,862 --> 00:25:54,329
Will you leave this place or not?

370
00:25:54,531 --> 00:25:56,226
Then, give me Rs.10000
you've in your pocket.

371
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,329
Rs.10000 in my pocket?

372
00:25:59,536 --> 00:26:01,834
How do you know l've
so much money?

373
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:04,006
Planned this after seeing you
put money into the pocket.

374
00:26:04,207 --> 00:26:07,108
Did you see?
Who could he be?

375
00:26:08,345 --> 00:26:11,075
Looks like he has planned is well,
get down, l'll give.

376
00:26:11,281 --> 00:26:12,339
Give me, l'll get down.

377
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:15,109
Who could've sent him?
Here...take it.

378
00:26:15,318 --> 00:26:17,513
Get down...get down...first.

379
00:26:17,721 --> 00:26:21,350
Trouble found me...
are you a thief?

380
00:26:21,558 --> 00:26:25,016
Not a thief but proved that one can
join service with you like this.

381
00:26:25,228 --> 00:26:28,356
- Why should you prove it to me?
- To work for you.

382
00:26:28,832 --> 00:26:32,199
Work for me?
What do you know about me?

383
00:26:32,402 --> 00:26:36,361
Your name is Deepawali.
You own a shop in Burma Bazaar.

384
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,368
l came to join you
collecting all details.

385
00:26:39,576 --> 00:26:44,206
You? Work with me?
The drama you played to seek a job,

386
00:26:44,414 --> 00:26:50,216
what's the guaranty that you'll not
threaten to die if don't give shop to you?

387
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,546
This is the first and last time.

388
00:26:51,755 --> 00:26:54,223
He's not leaving me even
after taking money.

389
00:26:54,424 --> 00:26:58,827
lf l don't offer him job, he'll play
this drama everyday.

390
00:26:59,029 --> 00:27:03,398
lt's better to offer him job than
to take blame for his death.

391
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,727
l liked your approach,
you're appointed.

392
00:27:05,935 --> 00:27:06,833
Thanks boss.

393
00:27:07,037 --> 00:27:08,402

396
00:27:11,107 --> 00:27:14,076
Should l take you to shop
on my bike?

397
00:27:14,277 --> 00:27:16,745
You sit on pillion,

l asked you to take out my Rs.10000.

401
00:27:22,452 --> 00:27:23,578
Give me without scratching.

402
00:27:23,787 --> 00:27:25,755
- l'll take it as advance.
- Then you're dismissed.

403
00:27:25,955 --> 00:27:27,252

404
00:27:27,457 --> 00:27:29,516

00:27:31,294 --> 00:27:32,261
Wear the helmet.

406
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,860
Why are you throwing on me?
Wear it.

407
00:27:37,634 --> 00:27:41,331
- Wear it on your head.
- Say it clearly, boss.

408
00:27:42,806 --> 00:27:43,773
Start the bike.

409
00:27:43,973 --> 00:27:46,203
Stop! Do you know to ride a bike?

410
00:27:47,644 --> 00:27:49,441
- What have you dared to ask?
- Shouldn't l ask?

411
00:27:49,646 --> 00:27:50,943
Hop on the bike.

412
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,958
Did l ride perfectly?
Get down boss.

413
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:04,453
Where's the boss?

414
00:28:04,828 --> 00:28:06,125
Why are you coming in an auto, boss?

415
00:28:06,763 --> 00:28:08,697
When did you get down, boss?

416
00:28:08,898 --> 00:28:11,128
When did l get on bike
to get down?

417
00:28:12,001 --> 00:28:15,129
l just lifted my leg and you sped off.

418
00:28:15,338 --> 00:28:16,805
ls this the way you treat your boss?

419
00:28:17,006 --> 00:28:18,974
l rushed off in the
excitement of getting a job.

420
00:28:19,342 --> 00:28:22,971
Boss, l don't see you as my boss
but as my own brother.

421
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:27,479
You'll do it initially but
later on throw me out,

422
00:28:27,684 --> 00:28:30,653
no, you'll never work for me,
get out.

423
00:28:30,854 --> 00:28:31,980
Leave it boss,
it was a small mistake.

424
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:35,817
lf you do it again,
l'll not be your brother.

425
00:28:36,025 --> 00:28:40,655
- Will you become uncle?
- Catch him, bloody!

426
00:28:40,864 --> 00:28:41,990
l'm talking to this man and
repartee comes from him.

427
00:28:42,198 --> 00:28:42,994
Catch him...catch him...

428
00:28:45,301 --> 00:28:49,169
Why are you laughing?
Are you smirking for his comment?

429
00:28:49,372 --> 00:28:52,773
lf you want to know about me,
please read the board behind you.

430
00:28:52,976 --> 00:28:54,034
Only then you'll know about me.

431
00:28:54,244 --> 00:28:55,302
Smirking!

432
00:28:55,578 --> 00:28:56,510
Why are you laughing now?

433
00:28:56,713 --> 00:28:58,374
All the positions are taken up by you.

434
00:28:58,581 --> 00:29:02,415
He didn't get elected to
these positions, he paid for it.

435
00:29:03,486 --> 00:29:05,010
Did he ask you?

436
00:29:05,255 --> 00:29:07,120
Why are you telling him?

437
00:29:07,323 --> 00:29:08,950
l'll pluck out your nose.

438
00:29:09,592 --> 00:29:10,559
Okay boss.

439
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,590
You didn't tell me who is he.

440
00:29:11,794 --> 00:29:13,421
Didn't you hear us discussing?

441
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,757
We were talking there,
so we couldn't hear you.

442
00:29:15,965 --> 00:29:17,227
lt means you weren't
working in shop.

443
00:29:17,433 --> 00:29:18,627
Only gossiping!

444
00:29:18,835 --> 00:29:21,702
l'm running shop taking loans
and you're wasting time here.

445
00:29:21,905 --> 00:29:24,840
One fine day l'll bury you
both in the shop.

446
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:27,100
Forget it boss, who is he?

447
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,834
Should l've to tell you?

448
00:29:29,045 --> 00:29:29,704
Tell me boss.

449
00:29:29,913 --> 00:29:32,211
Okay, l'll tell,
he'll work for me,

450
00:29:32,415 --> 00:29:34,679
never teach him to run the shop.

451
00:29:34,884 --> 00:29:37,819
You're the owner, we didn't allow you
to learn, would we allow him?

452
00:29:38,021 --> 00:29:40,455
Well said my boy!

453
00:29:40,757 --> 00:29:45,217
Appreciating him! You've almost
ruined every shop owner here.

454
00:29:49,933 --> 00:29:50,627
Take it sir.

455
00:29:54,204 --> 00:29:56,138
Raipur Sivamani!

456
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,574
Are you human?

457
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,238
Are you celebrating birthday too?

458
00:30:04,781 --> 00:30:05,873
Bloody!

459
00:30:06,082 --> 00:30:08,642
lf you're a goon, l'm also a goon.

460
00:30:10,787 --> 00:30:12,846
You'll die in my hands only!

461
00:30:18,695 --> 00:30:21,186
Why did you smear dung
on my boss' face?

462
00:30:32,141 --> 00:30:32,800
Save me!

463
00:30:39,649 --> 00:30:43,551

00:35:24,934 --> 00:35:32,033
<i>Your eyes told you to</i>
<i>look at me first...</i>

499
00:35:32,241 --> 00:35:40,148
<i>Rivers are born in mountains</i>
<i>but reach seas...</i>

500
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:44,183
<i>This is a language of hearts...</i>

501
00:35:44,387 --> 00:35:48,881
<i>Which language is better than this...</i>

502
00:35:49,091 --> 00:35:56,896
<i>l'm offering my life at your feet...</i>

503
00:35:57,099 --> 00:36:00,830
<i>God...God...</i>

504
00:36:01,037 --> 00:36:04,905
<i>l'm born again because of you...</i>

505
00:36:05,107 --> 00:36:08,804
<i>Dream...in my dreams...</i>

506
00:36:09,011 --> 00:36:12,777
<i>l've started to live on my own...</i>

507
00:36:12,982 --> 00:36:20,821
<i>Flowers offered in reverence are</i>
<i>waiting to reach your divine face...</i>

508
00:36:21,023 --> 00:36:28,930
<i>Temple bells ring happily</i>
<i>to reach the ears of you...</i>

509
00:36:29,131 --> 00:36:36,867
<i>Whatever l'm seeing now is reality</i>
<i>not hallucination...</i>

510
00:36:37,073 --> 00:36:45,208
<i>As charity you gave me life...</i>

511
00:36:54,226 --> 00:36:55,955
Mother! How did you know
it was me?

512
00:36:56,161 --> 00:37:00,222
l know...every time it rings
l think of you only.

513
00:37:00,432 --> 00:37:02,332
- Where are you now?
- l'm in Chennai, mom.

514
00:37:02,534 --> 00:37:03,933
Come back to home immediately.

515
00:37:04,236 --> 00:37:05,066
l'll come mother.

516
00:37:05,504 --> 00:37:07,301
Are you so angry on us?

517
00:37:07,506 --> 00:37:10,339
- Nothing like that mom.
- Hubby, Madhav has called.

518
00:37:11,043 --> 00:37:14,638
Your father isn't eating or sleeping
well since you left us.

519
00:37:14,846 --> 00:37:16,973
- Come home immediately son.
- l'll come mother,

520
00:37:17,215 --> 00:37:20,514
as father said l'll buy
new clothes for you and dad

521
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:22,084
<i>and come home for</i>
<i>this pongal festival.</i>

522
00:37:23,288 --> 00:37:24,721
Where is he?
What is he saying?

523
00:37:24,923 --> 00:37:28,017
Mother, l'm getting
Rs.100 a day as wage.

524
00:37:28,627 --> 00:37:31,323
Did you hear it?
His wage is only Rs.100 a day.

525
00:37:31,763 --> 00:37:35,460
Calculate, it'll come to
Rs.3000 a month.

526
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:37,362
Take care of your health, son.

527
00:37:37,569 --> 00:37:39,298
Don't worry about me, mom.

528
00:37:39,504 --> 00:37:40,368
You take care of your health.

529
00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:42,436
Hold on, your dad wants
to talk to you.

530
00:37:43,942 --> 00:37:45,933
l'll call you later,
boss is calling, mom.

531
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,347
- What happened?
- He cut the call.

532
00:37:50,549 --> 00:37:52,210
- Catch the phone.
- Toss it.

533
00:37:53,485 --> 00:37:54,884
My phone...phone...

534
00:37:55,721 --> 00:37:59,350
They look modern but
are pickpockets.

535
00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:10,259
Hello...hello...hello...you only!

536
00:38:10,469 --> 00:38:11,527
How are you?

537
00:38:11,737 --> 00:38:12,704
Don't you remember me?

538
00:38:12,904 --> 00:38:15,395
lt's me...water lorry...accident.

539
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,269
lf you were late by a second,
l...would be dead.

540
00:38:19,478 --> 00:38:22,413
l came to thank you
for saving my life.

541
00:38:28,854 --> 00:38:30,082
Why aren't you talking to me?

542
00:38:31,456 --> 00:38:32,718
Hey...hello...

543
00:38:38,463 --> 00:38:39,122
Hey!

544
00:38:43,168 --> 00:38:43,998
Coming!

545
00:38:44,236 --> 00:38:44,998
Push the car?

546
00:38:45,203 --> 00:38:46,602
What were you talking to that girl?

547
00:38:47,139 --> 00:38:48,333
Why are you hitting while talking?

548
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,700
Can we hit and talk later?

549
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:51,603
Why are you hitting me sir?

550
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:54,005
Look at him!
He's arguing with us!

551
00:38:55,414 --> 00:38:59,510
lf l see you talking to her again.

552
00:39:00,886 --> 00:39:02,877
You'll be there but as dead body.

553
00:39:03,622 --> 00:39:13,588
<font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=DARKORANGE size=40> Z!@ <font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=BLUE size=40> ~  <font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=GREEN size=40> Am@n

554
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:16,259
How is the business going on boys?

555
00:39:16,468 --> 00:39:17,628
lt's going without a break.

556
00:39:17,836 --> 00:39:20,566
Why are you saying like
it is dysentery?

557
00:39:20,772 --> 00:39:22,034
That too!

558
00:39:22,574 --> 00:39:24,474
He's saying things differently.

559
00:39:24,676 --> 00:39:27,144
Where's the new boy who joined us?

560
00:39:27,345 --> 00:39:28,573
He didn't come today.

561
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,907
- Where is he?
- Nobody knows it.

562
00:39:31,116 --> 00:39:33,380
- Did he tell when he'll be back?
- No.

563
00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:37,379
l'm asking you and you both are
answering without turning towards me.

564
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:39,716
- l'm your boss!
- What big boss?

565
00:39:39,925 --> 00:39:42,485
Who owns this shop?
You or that boy?

566
00:39:42,694 --> 00:39:44,753
You come and
ask details about sales,

567
00:39:44,963 --> 00:39:47,397
he comes and
asks about sale details,

568
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,760
won't we get confused if you
both come one after the other?

569
00:39:49,968 --> 00:39:52,300
First decide who is the boss
between you both.

570
00:39:52,504 --> 00:39:55,871
Till then l'm the owner of this shop,
if anyone comes l'll hack him!

571
00:39:56,074 --> 00:39:59,475
Will you hack your boss?
Bloody worker!

572
00:39:59,678 --> 00:40:02,613
Leave him boss...
what's this boss?

573
00:40:02,814 --> 00:40:04,509
You're the problem.

574
00:40:04,716 --> 00:40:05,648
Why are you coming now?

575
00:40:05,851 --> 00:40:07,250
l was here only.

576
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:09,243
They say you didn't come
and you say you were here.

577
00:40:09,454 --> 00:40:11,354
Boss, they're going blind.

578
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,284
Going blind?

579
00:40:12,491 --> 00:40:15,358
l can see clearly,
only the eyes are crossed.

580
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,255
- What's in your mouth?
- Teeth!

581
00:40:17,462 --> 00:40:19,362
That's inside, why is your lip bleeding?

582
00:40:19,965 --> 00:40:21,796
l ate a tomato, boss.

583
00:40:23,268 --> 00:40:25,031
Look, l think you're hiding
something from me.

584
00:40:25,237 --> 00:40:25,726
Nothing like that boss.

585
00:40:25,937 --> 00:40:27,268
- <i>Leader!</i>
- Who is it?

586
00:40:27,706 --> 00:40:28,798
Don't you know me, leader?

587
00:40:29,007 --> 00:40:29,939
l'm asking you, who are you?

588
00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:31,836
- Third shop further up your shop.
- Yes.

589
00:40:32,043 --> 00:40:33,806
- Fourth shop is after the third shop.
- Yes.

590
00:40:34,012 --> 00:40:35,502
- Fifth shop comes after the fourth.
- Yes.

591
00:40:35,714 --> 00:40:36,271
That's my shop.

592
00:40:36,481 --> 00:40:39,279
You could've told straight fifth shop,
why are you beating around the bush?

593
00:40:39,484 --> 00:40:40,849
l must tell you in detail, leader.

594
00:40:41,052 --> 00:40:41,746
What's your problem now?

595
00:40:41,953 --> 00:40:43,181
There's a main road in the
corner of this street, right?

596
00:40:43,388 --> 00:40:45,948
lt's not your dad's property,
it belongs to Govt.

597
00:40:46,157 --> 00:40:48,318
As you say let it be government's.

598
00:40:48,527 --> 00:40:51,428
An old woman was struggling
to cross the road.

599
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,154
My brother-in-law who about
to cross the same road,

600
00:40:53,365 --> 00:40:55,162
he helped her to cross the road
by holding her ear.

601
00:40:55,367 --> 00:40:59,269
Holding ear?
He should've held her hand.

602
00:40:59,471 --> 00:41:00,733
Why did he hold her ear?

603
00:41:00,939 --> 00:41:04,397
l don't know what was his idea,
police have arrested him now.

604
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:06,577
He did a good deed.
Was he arrested for that?

605
00:41:06,778 --> 00:41:08,075
Come and show your leadership power.

606
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,577
Where's the police station?

607
00:41:09,814 --> 00:41:10,781
- Come, l'll take you.
- Okay.

608
00:41:10,982 --> 00:41:12,108
- Boss!
- What?

609
00:41:12,317 --> 00:41:13,648
l smell something fishy in this.

610
00:41:13,852 --> 00:41:16,514
Whatever it may be,
l'm ready to face anything.

611
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:19,417
- You do your work...go...
- Okay boss, you carry on.

612
00:41:19,624 --> 00:41:22,991
You go...this is common ever since
l became leader of Burma Bazaar.

613
00:41:23,194 --> 00:41:25,025
lf you get up,
l'll kill you, rascal!

614
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:27,095
Where is he? Where is he?

615
00:41:27,632 --> 00:41:29,827
The boy sitting there without
shirt is my brother-in-law.

616
00:41:30,035 --> 00:41:30,899
ls it him?

617
00:41:31,102 --> 00:41:34,265
You fool! ldiot! Nasty fellow!

618
00:41:34,472 --> 00:41:38,602
lf police had caught you,
should've escaped and come to me.

619
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,540
lf you'd come,
officers would've come to me.

620
00:41:41,746 --> 00:41:43,407
Will you follow them meekly?

621
00:41:43,615 --> 00:41:44,980
Why are you insulting me?

622
00:41:45,183 --> 00:41:47,276
l'm losing honour in public
because of you.

623
00:41:47,886 --> 00:41:48,614
Get up!

624
00:41:49,454 --> 00:41:50,216
Come here!

625
00:41:50,855 --> 00:41:51,651
Come here l say!

626
00:41:51,856 --> 00:41:53,016
Stand behind me.

627
00:41:53,224 --> 00:41:56,057
How the hell you run this department?
How?

628
00:41:56,261 --> 00:41:59,856
Won't you inquire from leaders like me
about the people you arrest?

629
00:42:00,065 --> 00:42:00,963
Where is your lnspector?

630
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:02,064
Call him.

631
00:42:02,767 --> 00:42:04,530
Why are you shouting now?

632
00:42:04,736 --> 00:42:05,532
He's running away!

633
00:42:05,737 --> 00:42:07,728
Running...?

634
00:42:08,673 --> 00:42:09,697
lndeed he's running away!

635
00:42:09,908 --> 00:42:10,499
He ran away!

636
00:42:10,709 --> 00:42:12,540
Hey stop!

637
00:42:12,877 --> 00:42:14,845
What's the noise here?

638
00:42:15,146 --> 00:42:16,010
Who is he?

639
00:42:16,214 --> 00:42:17,738
l don't know who is he sir,

640
00:42:17,949 --> 00:42:20,383
he came and helped the
arrested man to escape.

641
00:42:20,585 --> 00:42:21,483
Helped him to escape?

642
00:42:22,253 --> 00:42:26,314
Sir, please don't get tensed,
he's my boy, he'll come back.

643
00:42:28,259 --> 00:42:31,820
We took great trouble
to arrest him,

644
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:35,659
30 policemen struggled
for 90 days to arrest him,

645
00:42:35,867 --> 00:42:38,335
you helped him to escape,
and now say he'll come back.

646
00:42:40,572 --> 00:42:41,561
Stop!

647
00:42:43,074 --> 00:42:44,735
What was his crime?

648
00:42:45,076 --> 00:42:47,738
An old woman was struggling
to cross the road,

649
00:42:47,946 --> 00:42:50,005
he felt she'll be weak
to hold her hand,

650
00:42:50,215 --> 00:42:51,512
he held her ear to help
cross the road.

651
00:42:51,816 --> 00:42:54,512
You arrested an innocent
for helping an old woman.

652
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:58,519
l'm asking you, is there any law that forbids
to hold ear and help cross the road?

653
00:42:58,723 --> 00:42:59,747
Hold her ear?

654
00:43:01,526 --> 00:43:05,519
he took her ear stud along with ear.

655
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:07,425
Cut the ear for stud?

656
00:43:08,133 --> 00:43:09,532
l wouldn't mind if l don't find him,

657
00:43:09,734 --> 00:43:13,192
but till l find the old woman's ear,
l'll beat you.

658
00:43:13,405 --> 00:43:14,895
Sir, l don't all these details.

659
00:43:15,106 --> 00:43:16,767
Sir...sir...

660
00:43:17,042 --> 00:43:18,942
Would we leave you
if you change your voice?

661
00:43:19,144 --> 00:43:20,406
l didn't say anything now, sir.

662
00:43:20,612 --> 00:43:22,011
- Who was that then?
- l don't know.

663
00:43:22,213 --> 00:43:23,111
lt's me boss!

664
00:43:24,082 --> 00:43:25,743
- Why did you come here?
- Keep quiet, boss.

665
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:28,111
You didn't listen to me
and bringing shame to me.

666
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:29,581
Am l bringing shame to you?

667
00:43:29,788 --> 00:43:32,222
Sir...do you know who my boss is?

668
00:43:32,857 --> 00:43:34,324
Leader of Burma Bazaar.

669
00:43:34,526 --> 00:43:38,758
He's just a leader of Burma bazaar,
you say as if he's leader of Burma.

670
00:43:38,963 --> 00:43:42,797
Sir...if you touch him again...

671
00:43:44,202 --> 00:43:46,136
l'll not come after that.

672
00:43:46,337 --> 00:43:47,099
Another person will come.

673
00:43:47,305 --> 00:43:48,363
Who will come?

674
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:53,338
- l'll not tell my boss will.
- Me? Who is it?

675
00:43:53,545 --> 00:43:55,479
Nobody will come, boss,
just making a false claim.

676
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,509
- That's him, boss?
- Who is that?

677
00:43:58,516 --> 00:43:59,642
He's leaving without
telling me who it is.

678
00:43:59,851 --> 00:44:01,478
- Who will come?
- l don't know.

679
00:44:01,686 --> 00:44:03,085
He says you know.

680
00:44:03,288 --> 00:44:04,915
That's what l too don't know.

681
00:44:06,691 --> 00:44:10,320
l'll telling you now, old woman's ear
is also not important to me,

682
00:44:10,729 --> 00:44:14,256
you'll get beaten up till l get
to know who will come.

683
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:15,928
Beat him!

684
00:44:30,381 --> 00:44:33,179
Hello...hello...my saviour!

685
00:44:34,285 --> 00:44:35,445
Water lorry...hello!

686
00:44:37,455 --> 00:44:38,183
Hello!

687
00:44:39,958 --> 00:44:41,755
Hello...hello madam...

688
00:44:42,026 --> 00:44:43,550
Hello...hello...please stop...

689
00:44:43,762 --> 00:44:44,854
Why did you do it?

690
00:44:45,063 --> 00:44:47,031
l came to thank but you got me
beaten up by goons.

691
00:44:47,232 --> 00:44:49,700
lf l knew you would do this,
l wouldn't dare come to you.

692
00:44:50,068 --> 00:44:52,002
All the night my body was aching.

693
00:44:52,403 --> 00:44:53,961
Look at me!

694
00:44:58,409 --> 00:45:00,138
Hello...hey you...

695
00:45:00,812 --> 00:45:01,471
Stop!

696
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:03,841
Say sorry for beating up
an innocent man like me.

697
00:45:04,048 --> 00:45:05,208
Only then l'll leave you.

698
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,378
Hello, l'm talking to you but you're
walking away without any response.

699
00:45:08,586 --> 00:45:11,453
Get lost! May you lose
the power of hearing!

700
00:45:11,656 --> 00:45:15,057
Excuse me...can't leave her,
because she's beautiful.

701
00:45:15,593 --> 00:45:17,322
Excuse me, you misunderstood me.

702
00:45:17,529 --> 00:45:18,757
Humans must show gratitude.

703
00:45:18,963 --> 00:45:20,055
l've plenty of it.

704
00:45:20,331 --> 00:45:22,322
But you don't have a heart
to accept it.

705
00:45:22,534 --> 00:45:23,660
After that it's your wish.

706
00:45:24,035 --> 00:45:25,161
Excuse...

707
00:45:27,105 --> 00:45:29,198
lf l come, you run away,
if l go away, you'll come to me.

708
00:45:29,407 --> 00:45:31,204
Girls are like that!

709
00:45:34,045 --> 00:45:35,137
Here comes the trouble again!

710
00:45:35,346 --> 00:45:37,439
They are coming like child kidnappers.

711
00:45:38,283 --> 00:45:40,183
Can't you understand if we tell once?

712
00:45:41,152 --> 00:45:43,677
l was new to the town,
you hit me, l took it.

713
00:45:43,955 --> 00:45:47,015
Am l dust bin to take always
whatever you throw?

714
00:45:47,659 --> 00:45:50,924
Look, one punch will bloody
your nose, so go away.

715
00:45:52,463 --> 00:45:53,452
ls it bleeding now?

716
00:45:54,199 --> 00:45:55,029
lt will bleed now!

717
00:45:59,204 --> 00:46:01,069
- Blood!
- lf l punch, it'll bleed.

718
00:46:01,306 --> 00:46:03,069
Are you ATM to get money?

719
00:46:03,474 --> 00:46:04,600
Dared to lay hands on Varadhan!

720
00:46:06,477 --> 00:46:07,705
l forgot to kick him, right?

721
00:46:09,414 --> 00:46:12,713
Why are you inciting me to run?

722
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:03,832
lf you trouble me again, all of you will
be there but as dead bodies.

723
00:48:07,374 --> 00:48:09,308
lf you spread hands,
l'll give alms,

724
00:48:09,509 --> 00:48:11,204
if you raise hands on me,
l'll break it.

725
00:48:11,411 --> 00:48:12,309
Bloody!

726
00:48:13,213 --> 00:48:14,111
Way please!

727
00:48:24,257 --> 00:48:27,852
He beat ten people alone,
he's not like others.

728
00:48:29,229 --> 00:48:31,356
He beat us black and blue,
are you praising him?

729
00:48:31,898 --> 00:48:33,866
Let's tell our boss and
bump him off.

730
00:48:34,734 --> 00:48:35,792
lf boss comes to know,
we'll lose ourjobs.

731
00:48:36,002 --> 00:48:37,026
What should we say for the wounds?

732
00:48:37,237 --> 00:48:38,465
Let's say we met with an accident.

733
00:48:38,638 --> 00:48:40,003
Not a scratch on the vehicle, Varadha!

734
00:49:07,534 --> 00:49:14,940
<i>Who touched me and</i>
<i>turned this sand into a statue?</i>

735
00:49:17,243 --> 00:49:18,642
Are you a human?

736
00:49:20,647 --> 00:49:24,913
l lost my honour, respect,
and friends too because of you.

737
00:49:26,619 --> 00:49:29,349
Shameless man! You...

738
00:49:33,093 --> 00:49:38,793
Madhav, Deepawali sucked our blood
like a leech till now.

739
00:49:39,733 --> 00:49:44,363
You came and put an end to it
and we are drinking now.

740
00:49:44,738 --> 00:49:46,330
- That's great!
- Correct!

741
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:47,570
Anything else, sir?

742
00:49:47,774 --> 00:49:50,038
- Have intestines?
- No.

743
00:49:50,243 --> 00:49:51,540
How do you do it then?

744
00:49:52,545 --> 00:49:53,534
Nasty fellow!

745
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:58,479
Come, have drinks and slip out silently.

746
00:50:03,823 --> 00:50:06,656
What sort of a place is this?

747
00:50:07,193 --> 00:50:09,127
A girl saved my life,

748
00:50:09,329 --> 00:50:10,921
l went to thank her,

749
00:50:11,131 --> 00:50:12,393
she's engaging goons to beat me,

750
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,167
am l any less to her?
l bashed them all.

751
00:50:18,872 --> 00:50:20,134
What's that man...

752
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,235
- Your boss' name?
- Deepawali.

753
00:50:22,776 --> 00:50:23,834
Diwali?

754
00:50:24,044 --> 00:50:25,671
He's real crook.

755
00:50:25,879 --> 00:50:29,178
He pays Rs.100 but makes
you work for Rs.2000.

756
00:50:29,849 --> 00:50:31,180
l'll take him to task.

757
00:50:31,384 --> 00:50:36,321
Let my honour, respect
and friends go to the dogs.

758
00:50:36,523 --> 00:50:38,184
Let everything go!

759
00:50:39,225 --> 00:50:44,162
- But you're with me, that's enough!
- <i>Who is it?</i>

760
00:50:44,964 --> 00:50:49,697
Come, have drinks and
slip out silently.

761
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:54,333
Do you know who l'm?
Sivamani's henchman...

762
00:50:57,277 --> 00:51:00,644
Why did you claim you're
Sivamani's henchman?

763
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:06,011
l was about to say we saw Sivamani's
men cutting a man's hand but...

764
00:51:06,219 --> 00:51:07,846
l got cough before finishing it.

765
00:51:09,923 --> 00:51:10,855
Shall we go?

766
00:51:11,591 --> 00:51:14,890
Carry him, if not someone may
eat him as side dish.

767
00:51:20,066 --> 00:51:22,034
- Can't you watch and walk?
- Sorry brother.

768

Feeling is good,
but why is she dull?

770
00:51:41,821 --> 00:51:43,015
Let me go in and see.

771
00:51:50,697 --> 00:51:52,631
Has she kept it locked?

772
00:51:53,666 --> 00:51:54,792
Let me see it.
Hello...hello...

773
00:51:55,135 --> 00:51:56,193
She's making me run.

774
00:51:56,402 --> 00:51:58,393
Hello...can you speak or not?

775
00:51:58,571 --> 00:52:02,507
Do you know? l bashed up
men sent by you, did they tell you?

776
00:52:09,482 --> 00:52:10,642
Where are you taking me?

777
00:52:12,552 --> 00:52:16,488
Why did you bring me here?
Why are you silent now?

778
00:52:16,689 --> 00:52:17,849
Say something.

779
00:52:18,324 --> 00:52:20,258
Listen to me, don't ever follow me.

780
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:22,860
Wow! l asked you to talk
but you're singing.

781
00:52:23,062 --> 00:52:26,361
You've great voice like P.Susheela
but wasted it till now.

782
00:52:26,566 --> 00:52:28,966
l don't know who you are,
why should l speak with you?

783
00:52:29,502 --> 00:52:31,333
My name is Madhav,
from Ramanathapuram,

784
00:52:31,538 --> 00:52:33,836
only son, one mother and father.

785
00:52:35,041 --> 00:52:37,509
l'm warning you again, your life will
be in danger if you follow me.

786
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:41,646
Tell me your problem like a friend,
tell if you really trust me.

787
00:52:42,348 --> 00:52:43,679
l don't need to tell you.

788
00:52:43,883 --> 00:52:45,680
l'm not leaving if you don't.

789
00:52:45,885 --> 00:52:48,581
Excuse me, l saved your life,
that's it.

790
00:52:49,122 --> 00:52:51,556
Only thing l got was losing
my cell phone.

791
00:52:51,758 --> 00:52:52,725
Let it go.

792
00:52:53,326 --> 00:52:55,226
Who would've taken my phone?

793
00:52:55,428 --> 00:52:57,726
He has switched it off, bloody rascal.

794
00:52:59,499 --> 00:53:02,332
Forget about it,
tell me what's your problem?

795
00:53:04,304 --> 00:53:05,999
Come on...tell me...

796
00:53:07,073 --> 00:53:08,597

- You spoilt my sleep.

842
00:58:33,112 --> 00:58:34,079
But you're sleeping happily.

843
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,577
Are you playing with me?

844
00:58:36,282 --> 00:58:38,250

857
00:59:16,089 --> 00:59:18,956

Did you see it?

884
01:01:18,173 --> 01:01:22,803
Any man talking to you other than me,
the result will be this.

885
01:01:23,412 --> 01:01:26,745
Even if your father talks to you for
more than 10 minutes, he too will...

886
01:01:28,984 --> 01:01:29,712
What's the time?

Hey mister! lt's better you

906

Hey Madhu, please come in.

lt seems a boy was
teasing you, right?

914
01:03:07,215 --> 01:03:12,175
- Nothing like that.
- My boys told me. Come...come in.

01:03:44,523 --> 01:03:46,491
You appear educated.

924
01:03:47,025 --> 01:03:48,549
Why are you behaving like this?

925
01:03:48,293 --> 01:03:49,419
Who? Me?

926
01:03:49,895 --> 01:03:53,092
Sorry, please, excuse me,

927
01:03:53,565 --> 01:03:56,193
do you think l'm educated
to use these words?

928
01:03:57,970 --> 01:04:00,438
When l bash rich brat boys,

929
01:04:00,639 --> 01:04:03,608
they shout, sorry brother...
please brother...

930
01:04:03,909 --> 01:04:05,774
l picked these English words from them.

931
01:04:05,978 --> 01:04:10,779

932

- Vanraj! - Brother!

935
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:23,458
Madhu, go carefully.

936
01:04:26,598 --> 01:04:31,297
She's happy inside but
feeling shy to accept it.

937
01:04:31,503 --> 01:04:32,970
- lsn't it?
- Yes boss.

938
01:04:33,338 --> 01:04:35,898

940
01:04:42,948 --> 01:04:44,381
Please don't follow me.

941
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:55,057
My foot! Your story is fearsome.

942
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:58,821
You're beautiful,
so l wanted to befriend you.

943
01:04:59,031 --> 01:05:02,000
You narrated a story in this
hot sun on a terrace,

944
01:05:02,367 --> 01:05:03,766
that he will cut tongue
and burn bums,

945
01:05:03,969 --> 01:05:06,437
water lorry is better than this,

946
01:05:06,638 --> 01:05:09,004
l too thought you were
an angel in churidhar,

947
01:05:09,208 --> 01:05:12,336
now l've understood you're
a Tsunami in a churidhar.

948
01:05:13,879 --> 01:05:15,403
There's a saying back in my village,

949
01:05:15,614 --> 01:05:17,514
difficult...difficult...
temple going...

950
01:05:17,716 --> 01:05:21,516
temple inside, two difficult dancing
...without dress.

951
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:22,778
Didn't get me?

952
01:05:22,988 --> 01:05:25,855
That's if one goes to temple
facing many problems,

953
01:05:26,058 --> 01:05:28,754
problems were waiting
there for him.

954
01:05:30,062 --> 01:05:34,192
l'm feeling for leaving home
and reaching a wrong place.

955
01:05:34,566 --> 01:05:39,526
And you're dropping a bombshell
on me like interval block. Bye!

956
01:05:40,405 --> 01:05:42,032
Sorry, l'll never come.

957
01:05:42,241 --> 01:05:44,971
Get me down, girls are like this only.

958
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,439
<i>Companion...girl friend...</i>

959
01:05:52,651 --> 01:05:55,779
- Can't you ride properly?
- l came to see you only.

960
01:05:57,155 --> 01:05:58,520
l love you da!

961
01:06:02,494 --> 01:06:04,962
Do you consider yourself to be
Sivaji of film 'Mudhal Mariyadhai'?

962
01:06:06,665 --> 01:06:09,634
No, Vijay of film 'Kadhalukku Mariyadhai'

963
01:06:09,835 --> 01:06:11,962
Do you see yourself in mirror?

964
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:16,971
lt's for people without personality,
flowers don't need advertisement.

965
01:06:18,343 --> 01:06:20,641
l'm angry, l'll scold you informally.

966
01:06:20,846 --> 01:06:23,474
Use it but only to call not to go.

967
01:06:25,183 --> 01:06:26,650
Slipper will wear out, be careful.

968
01:06:29,621 --> 01:06:34,820
She used every bad word in Tamil,
why are you keeping quiet?

969
01:06:35,027 --> 01:06:40,988
ln love, patience and
forbearance is very important.

970
01:06:41,867 --> 01:06:44,495
- l think he'll not quit till he
gets publicly bashed up.- Yes.

971
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:49,268
Excuse me.

972

ls doctor in?

973
01:06:52,277 --> 01:06:52,834
Who are you?

974
01:06:53,045 --> 01:06:54,842
l'm your daughter's professor's son.

975
01:06:55,047 --> 01:06:57,515

01:06:57,716 --> 01:07:00,514

01:07:01,219 --> 01:07:02,186
Okay...okay...go in.

01:07:02,387 --> 01:07:04,014
Not from Andhra,

979
01:07:04,323 --> 01:07:05,688
- Not that, go in.
- Okay.

980
01:07:08,727 --> 01:07:11,525
You said you'll never see me again,
why did you come now?

981
01:07:13,231 --> 01:07:17,099
l gave a good thought about it,
Sivamani is torturing you a lot,

982
01:07:17,736 --> 01:07:22,537
l must relieve you form it,
because you saved my life.

983
01:07:22,741 --> 01:07:23,537
That's why?

984
01:07:23,742 --> 01:07:27,701
That's why l've decided to help you.

985
01:07:28,947 --> 01:07:30,437
You can't do anything.

986
01:07:30,649 --> 01:07:38,988
Can't do, can't get, impossible,
all these words are not in my dictionary.

987
01:07:39,558 --> 01:07:42,220
Think positively.
You'll get good result.

988
01:07:42,427 --> 01:07:43,223
What are you trying to say?

989
01:07:43,695 --> 01:07:45,060
Go straight to Sivamani,

990
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:47,725
there's a handsome boy Madhav
in Burma bazaar,

991
01:07:47,933 --> 01:07:49,230
and tell him you love Madhav,

992
01:07:50,268 --> 01:07:51,997
then watch the unfolding drama.

993
01:07:52,204 --> 01:07:53,171
Are you mad?

994
01:07:53,772 --> 01:07:56,240
They will cut a man's hand
for asking me an address.

995
01:07:56,441 --> 01:07:59,069
Won't they kill you
if l say l love you?

996
01:07:59,444 --> 01:08:01,412
Nothing will happen to me,
go and tell him bravely.

997
01:08:02,114 --> 01:08:04,082
- Are you confused?
- Yes.

998
01:08:04,883 --> 01:08:07,317
lf you're confused,
you can't even catch a hen,

999
01:08:07,953 --> 01:08:10,421
if you're sharp, you can
play kabadi on moon also.

1000
01:08:14,793 --> 01:08:16,590
Madhav, she has fallen!

1001
01:08:20,465 --> 01:08:24,094
- Brother, sister-in-law is here.
- Madhu, please come in.

1002
01:08:24,403 --> 01:08:25,768
Had you informed,
l would've come myself.

1003
01:08:26,071 --> 01:08:29,268
l knew one day you'll understand
and come to me.

1004
01:08:30,242 --> 01:08:33,439
Tell me...when shall we marry?

1005
01:08:33,812 --> 01:08:37,543
- No, in Burma bazaar...
- ln Burma bazaar?

1006
01:08:38,083 --> 01:08:39,175
Tell me...in Burma bazaar?

1007
01:08:39,484 --> 01:08:42,044
What do you want to buy?
Let's buy entire bazaar.

1008
01:08:42,254 --> 01:08:46,452
No, there's a boy known
as Madhav in Burma bazaar,

1009
01:08:47,492 --> 01:08:48,789
l love him!

1010
01:08:50,762 --> 01:08:52,627
You're in love with me for 3 years,

1011
01:08:53,165 --> 01:08:54,792
l never had those feelings for you,

1012
01:08:55,567 --> 01:08:56,625
<i>it'll never come.</i>

1013
01:08:57,335 --> 01:09:00,964
l saw him and fell in love instantly.
Please forget me.

1014
01:09:01,506 --> 01:09:02,973
Please don't disturb me.

1015
01:09:03,942 --> 01:09:06,240
l told you long back,
did you get it now?

1016
01:09:10,282 --> 01:09:11,647
Who is Madhav?

1017
01:09:12,551 --> 01:09:14,610
- Price of that scent?
- lt's not good, get lost.

1018
01:09:16,321 --> 01:09:19,950
ls this how you do business?
ls this waste goods?

1019
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:21,284
- Today's sales?
- Rs.2000.

1020
01:09:21,493 --> 01:09:23,461
- l left it in the cash box.
- That's it.

1021
01:09:23,795 --> 01:09:24,784
Didn't sell anything today?

1022
01:09:24,996 --> 01:09:26,623
- Why are you blocking the way?
- Who is that?

1023
01:09:27,999 --> 01:09:28,465
Greetings boss.

1024
01:09:28,667 --> 01:09:29,793
Coming late and then greeting me.

1025
01:09:30,168 --> 01:09:31,897
Why are you calling me like girl friend?

1026
01:09:32,104 --> 01:09:32,627
Come closer, l'll tell you.

1027
01:09:32,838 --> 01:09:34,806
- What's the matter?
- l need Rs.2000.

1028
01:09:35,006 --> 01:09:36,473
Why are you asking like
business partner?

1029
01:09:36,675 --> 01:09:39,041
Boss, you'll be shocked
if you hear the news.

1030
01:09:39,244 --> 01:09:42,304
lf you give me Rs.2000,
l'll make Rs.10000 in one hour.

1031
01:09:42,681 --> 01:09:43,477
How?

1032
01:09:43,682 --> 01:09:45,309
That's trade secret, l can't reveal it.

1033
01:09:45,951 --> 01:09:47,543
Okay...how can l believe you?

1034
01:09:47,752 --> 01:09:49,982
How to make you believe...
please lie down here.

1035
01:09:51,957 --> 01:09:53,754
l crossed over him,
now it's you will and wish.

1036
01:09:54,292 --> 01:09:55,418
Trust him, boss.

1037
01:09:57,295 --> 01:09:58,319
Come here.

1038
01:09:59,364 --> 01:10:01,992
l'm trusting because you
crossed over him,

1039
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,827
l'm trusting you.

1040
01:10:04,035 --> 01:10:06,503
lf you do the promised business,

1041
01:10:06,705 --> 01:10:08,172
your salary this month
will be Rs.5000.

1042
01:10:08,373 --> 01:10:11,501
lf you cheat me,
get lost with this Rs.2000.

1043
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:14,941
Okay boss.
Let this deal be within us only.

1044
01:10:16,248 --> 01:10:18,273
Nobody must know where l'm going.

1045
01:10:20,118 --> 01:10:22,518
You mustn't tell anyone
even they beat you.

1046
01:10:23,054 --> 01:10:24,681
Shouldn't l tell even if they beat me?

1047
01:10:25,223 --> 01:10:27,521
The last dialogue is little fishy.

1048
01:10:32,063 --> 01:10:33,690
ln which shop Madhav works here?

1049
01:10:33,899 --> 01:10:35,366
Ask the man in green shirt.

1050
01:10:35,734 --> 01:10:39,033
Boss, yesterday business was okay,
today it's very dull.

1051
01:10:39,471 --> 01:10:41,530
Dull? You chase away
all the customers.

1052
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:44,538
- Who is Madhav here?
- Madhav...Madhav...

1053
01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:47,435
Daddy will buy you toys
in another shop, okay?

1054
01:10:47,646 --> 01:10:48,544
Okay dad.

1055
01:10:48,813 --> 01:10:51,213
On facing danger, they became
customers and left the place.

1056
01:10:51,416 --> 01:10:52,713
Am l not asking you?

1057
01:10:52,918 --> 01:10:55,887
Who knows where Madhav has gone?
l don't know.

1058
01:10:56,087 --> 01:10:57,714
- Don't know or don't want to tell.
- l'll not tell.

1059
01:10:57,923 --> 01:11:00,721
He works for me,
why should l tell you about him?

1060
01:11:00,926 --> 01:11:01,722
Nobody is here to support me.

1061
01:11:01,927 --> 01:11:02,723
Can l make you tell about him?

1062
01:11:02,928 --> 01:11:06,386
- You can't get information from me.
- You said no but say yes now.

1063
01:11:06,598 --> 01:11:10,557
- Come...l'll make you answer.
- Look, l'm leader of Burma bazaar.

1064
01:11:10,769 --> 01:11:13,897
No...no...they're ransacking
my shop.

1065
01:11:14,105 --> 01:11:15,902
<i>Please don't beat me.</i>

1066
01:11:16,107 --> 01:11:18,905
<i>They are ransacking shop</i>
<i>and beating me too.</i>

1067
01:11:21,446 --> 01:11:23,744
He told me not to tell
even if they beat me.

1068
01:11:24,382 --> 01:11:26,907
These guys are beating
if l don't tell them.

1069
01:11:27,719 --> 01:11:30,153
l'm getting crushed between them.

1070
01:11:30,388 --> 01:11:32,413
Come dear...
what is your husband doing?

1071
01:11:32,624 --> 01:11:34,251
He makes brooms.
Open your mouth.

1072
01:11:34,459 --> 01:11:35,255
Let him do it.

1073
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:43,424
lt's very hard!

1074
01:11:43,802 --> 01:11:46,270
Hospital bread will be like this only.

1075
01:11:49,641 --> 01:11:50,767
What are you searching?

1076
01:11:50,976 --> 01:11:51,943
Where's the thing l placed
in your mouth?

1077
01:11:52,143 --> 01:11:52,700
l ate it.

1078
01:11:52,911 --> 01:11:53,775
Ate it?

1079
01:11:54,479 --> 01:11:56,947
- You beast! Son of a beast!
- Why?

1080
01:11:57,148 --> 01:11:58,445
ls it lollipop to eat?

1081
01:11:58,650 --> 01:12:00,277
lsn't it that, then?

1082
01:12:00,485 --> 01:12:03,784
- lt's a thermometer.
- lt means?

1083
01:12:04,089 --> 01:12:06,023
lt's an instrument to check
body temperature, you idiot!

1084
01:12:06,224 --> 01:12:07,953
lnstrument to check
body temperature?

1085
01:12:08,493 --> 01:12:11,951
That's why it was tasting
like tasteless marble!

1086
01:12:12,163 --> 01:12:13,187
l swallowed it.

1087
01:12:13,398 --> 01:12:14,831
Why are you giving us trouble?

1088
01:12:15,033 --> 01:12:19,800
Won't you tell what you're putting
in a patient's mouth?

1089
01:12:20,005 --> 01:12:21,905
Give me something for relief.

1090
01:12:22,107 --> 01:12:24,234
Nothing will happen. Be brave.

1091
01:12:24,776 --> 01:12:26,710
Don't swallow this one too,
open your mouth.

1092
01:12:27,412 --> 01:12:28,674
What a big mouth!

1093
01:12:30,915 --> 01:12:32,314
Shall l go? Want me to go?

1094
01:12:32,517 --> 01:12:35,315
We went, but he's not there.

1095
01:12:35,854 --> 01:12:38,414
Bloody! His body should've been here.

1096
01:12:48,767 --> 01:12:52,134
Give us an hour, he'll be here.

1097
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:05,816
lf he's not here,
none of you would be alive.

1098
01:13:06,685 --> 01:13:07,515
Sir!

1099
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,509
Who are you?

1100
01:13:10,488 --> 01:13:12,353
l'm Madhav, the man you're searching.

1101
01:13:13,725 --> 01:13:15,693
Wait boss, am l not here?

1102
01:13:16,561 --> 01:13:18,961
Sivamani sir, there's a mistake somewhere.

1103
01:13:19,164 --> 01:13:20,222
Please give me way.

1104
01:13:20,432 --> 01:13:23,401
l don't love the girl as you think.

1105
01:13:24,436 --> 01:13:28,736
That girl came on her own and said
l'm smart and she loves me.

1106
01:13:29,808 --> 01:13:32,743
l too fell for her beauty.

1107
01:13:33,678 --> 01:13:34,645
<i>Am l not talking to him?</i>

1108
01:13:37,649 --> 01:13:40,641
Later l inquired, it seems
you love her for 3 years,

1109
01:13:41,252 --> 01:13:42,378
How can l...?

1110
01:13:42,921 --> 01:13:45,287
Sir, you're Bill Gates!
l'm a beggar.

1111
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:47,754
You're great!
l'm waste.

1112
01:13:47,959 --> 01:13:51,360
lnfact you're Pandian express
and l'm punctured bicycle.

1113
01:13:51,563 --> 01:13:56,466
Sir, you're big Anaconda in forest,
l'm just earth worm.

1114
01:13:56,668 --> 01:13:58,863
lt means you don't have anything
to do with my Madhu, right?

1115
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:01,800
l swear on my family deity Kali,
absolutely no connection.

1116
01:14:02,006 --> 01:14:04,304
l don't know why she told
you like that.

1117
01:14:04,909 --> 01:14:07,070
l don't want trouble,
l'll return to my native place.

1118
01:14:07,278 --> 01:14:10,145
- Will you go back as you said?
- l will sir.

1119
01:14:10,415 --> 01:14:12,110
lf not l know you'll kill me.

1120
01:14:12,851 --> 01:14:13,476
Bye.

1121
01:14:13,918 --> 01:14:29,892
<font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=DARKORANGE size=40> Z!@ <font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=BLUE size=40> ~  <font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=GREEN size=40> Am@n

1122
01:14:30,201 --> 01:14:31,896
Actually, what had happened?

1123
01:14:32,103 --> 01:14:34,537
lt already happened, why again?

1124
01:14:34,806 --> 01:14:36,330
Actually, you should be here.

1125
01:14:36,541 --> 01:14:38,372
Boss, say which audience
can understand.

1126
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:42,040
Sivamani group came searching for you,

1127
01:14:42,247 --> 01:14:43,942
l told them he's not here,

1128
01:14:44,149 --> 01:14:45,446
without even considering me
as the shop owner,

1129
01:14:45,650 --> 01:14:48,118
they bashed me up black and blue.

1130
01:14:48,319 --> 01:14:51,015
Why? What's the trouble between
you and Sivamani?

1131
01:14:51,222 --> 01:14:53,349
l love the girl Sivamani loves...

1132
01:14:54,459 --> 01:14:55,824
The girl Sivamani loves...?

1133
01:14:56,027 --> 01:14:57,961
Where are you?
l'm inside the hospital.

1134
01:14:58,163 --> 01:14:59,596
What's the girl's name?

1135
01:15:00,265 --> 01:15:01,630
Her name ends with 'Dhi'.

1136
01:15:01,866 --> 01:15:05,131
How can l decipher with last letter,
what's the first letter?

1137
01:15:06,604 --> 01:15:07,764
- 'Ma'
- 'Ma'...?

1138
01:15:08,373 --> 01:15:09,897
- Madhu?
- Yeah!

1139
01:15:10,108 --> 01:15:12,736
Have you forgotten a five letter word?

1140
01:15:12,944 --> 01:15:17,244
You're stretching it as if her
name had 80 letters.

1141
01:15:17,449 --> 01:15:20,043
Why? Why this show?

1142
01:15:20,251 --> 01:15:25,348
You haven't touched ordinary place,
he's a transformer.

1143
01:15:25,557 --> 01:15:28,390
Not only that you want me
also to get electrocuted.

1144
01:15:28,593 --> 01:15:29,491
Catch it, boss.

1145
01:15:32,096 --> 01:15:34,894
Boss, don't get scared
on facing danger,

1146
01:15:35,099 --> 01:15:36,566
stand up and face it bravely.

1147
01:15:36,768 --> 01:15:38,395
Already they have damaged my face.

1148
01:15:38,603 --> 01:15:41,163
Have they left any place?

1149
01:15:42,474 --> 01:15:44,374
- Go away.
- Don't get angry boss.

1150
01:15:44,576 --> 01:15:46,373
Do you know who sincerely l love Madhu?

1151
01:15:49,147 --> 01:15:50,944
Didn't you help the girl really?

1152
01:15:51,149 --> 01:15:51,843
No way!

1153
01:15:52,050 --> 01:15:54,018
We'll come as innocents from village,

1154
01:15:54,219 --> 01:15:56,449
a girl will hold my hand
and narrate a tale,

1155
01:15:56,654 --> 01:15:57,586
and l'll help her,

1156
01:15:57,789 --> 01:16:00,121
and Sivamani will take
and bash me severely.

1157
01:16:00,325 --> 01:16:01,952
Do l need all this boss?

1158
01:16:03,027 --> 01:16:06,963
lf you were afraid to say from close,
why not shout from long and run away?

1159
01:16:07,165 --> 01:16:11,602
Already Sivamani is torturing her
in the name of love for 3 years,

1160
01:16:12,103 --> 01:16:15,266
am l fool to express my love
for her at this juncture?

1161
01:16:16,274 --> 01:16:20,370
Many follow the style of chasing
a girl and expressing their love,

1162
01:16:20,578 --> 01:16:25,277
my style is to make her accept
love first and then follow her.

1163
01:16:26,584 --> 01:16:27,744
You're confusing me.

1164
01:16:27,952 --> 01:16:30,887
l made her say she loves me
with Sivamani.

1165
01:16:32,357 --> 01:16:33,824
ls yours one side love?

1166
01:16:34,025 --> 01:16:36,960
Love can be one side or two side
but it shouldn't end in suicide.

1167
01:16:37,161 --> 01:16:40,858
She has lied to Sivamani
that she loves you.

1168
01:16:41,065 --> 01:16:42,862
But you really love her.

1169
01:16:43,067 --> 01:16:46,559
lf she comes to know this
how much pain she'll go through.

1170
01:16:46,771 --> 01:16:49,239
Let her!
Today's pain, tomorrow's gain!

1171
01:16:50,842 --> 01:16:54,710
lt's clap only when two hands join!

1172
01:16:54,913 --> 01:16:56,278
You can't clap with one hand!

1173
01:16:56,481 --> 01:16:58,108
Who said you can't clap?

1174
01:16:58,316 --> 01:16:59,647
Watch now, it will!

1175
01:17:06,991 --> 01:17:07,582
lsn't it?

1176
01:17:07,792 --> 01:17:14,061
The real show begins now.

1177
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:23,328
A useless bratjoined me
and my shop is shut down.

1178
01:17:23,705 --> 01:17:29,337
Madhav means a great benefactor
but this Madhav spoils everything.

1179
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:31,870
l invited this trouble on my own.

1180
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,570
Make a tea for me.

1181
01:17:33,782 --> 01:17:34,908
<i>How many?</i>

1182
01:17:35,117 --> 01:17:38,553
One man will have one tea only,
will he have ten teas?

1183
01:17:38,754 --> 01:17:39,880
What's this silly question?
Make one tea.

1184
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:42,852
- Our boss is always king!
- Boss...?

1185
01:17:45,561 --> 01:17:46,528
What are you doing here?

1186
01:17:46,728 --> 01:17:48,958
lf one shop closes,
we mustjoin another shop, right?

1187
01:17:49,197 --> 01:17:51,358
You both are shutting down shops
one after the other, right?

1188
01:17:51,567 --> 01:17:54,764
Only then my name Narimuthu
fits me perfectly.

1189
01:17:55,637 --> 01:17:57,969
Bloody cutthroats!

1190
01:17:58,173 --> 01:18:00,733
How smart he is!
That's Narimuthu!

1191
01:18:00,943 --> 01:18:02,240
How long in this shop?

1192
01:18:02,444 --> 01:18:05,675
We'll decide on the capacity
of this shop owner.

1193
01:18:05,881 --> 01:18:10,318
Yes, if owner is weak,
worker will be rule the roost.

1194
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,953
Bloody bandicoots!

1195
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:20,053
What am l to do now?
ls it my mistake to be born as girl?

1196
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:24,158
A man saved me and
he too wants to marry me.

1197
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:27,665
l saved Madhav and
he too loves me.

1198
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:30,201
One more man too,
he'll be of my father's age,

1199
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:31,565
he too is approaching me.

1200
01:18:31,773 --> 01:18:34,173
- Did Madhav say he loves you?
- Yes.

1201
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:36,742
l heard him say that with his boss.

1202
01:18:36,945 --> 01:18:39,971
Why didn't you take him
to task immediately?

1203
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:45,118
No need, if Madhav comes after me,
Sivamani will know about it,

1204
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,987
Sivamani will hit him,

1205
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:49,390
Madhav will attack him
if he has courage,

1206
01:18:49,591 --> 01:18:52,788
anyway one will die and
another will go to jail,

1207
01:18:52,995 --> 01:18:54,087
l'll be safe.

1208
01:18:54,863 --> 01:18:56,023
Clever girl!

1209
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,299
l make tea with wine!

1210
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:01,264
Are you taking a u-turn with train?

1211
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:02,129
l'm coming!

1212
01:19:02,337 --> 01:19:03,964
- Madhav is coming.
- Change the topic.

1213
01:19:04,172 --> 01:19:05,901
Hey boys! Sorry...hey girls!

1214
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:09,040
How are you?
Are you doing fine?

1215
01:19:10,212 --> 01:19:11,201
lgnore him.

1216
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:15,041
- Why are you dull?
- Nothing Madhav.

1217
01:19:16,218 --> 01:19:17,480
No, something is wrong.

1218
01:19:17,686 --> 01:19:21,019
lt's quite difficult to trust people now.

1219
01:19:21,223 --> 01:19:23,555
They say something but their
intentions are different.

1220
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:27,217
l'm not like that, l'm very open.

1221
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:29,954
lnfact many times l don't
even put my shirt buttons.

1222
01:19:30,365 --> 01:19:32,299
Madhu, there's something
in your heart.

1223
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:33,525
Nothing.

1224
01:19:33,735 --> 01:19:36,135
- Then, l'll test you.
- What?

1225
01:19:36,338 --> 01:19:37,805
- Take it.
- What is this?

1226
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:40,508
- A small gift for you.
- Why?

1227
01:19:41,043 --> 01:19:42,738
- Friendly!
- l don't want.

1228
01:19:43,645 --> 01:19:45,306
Take it for my sake.
Take it.

1229
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:48,344
You all come together to enjoy, right?

1230
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:49,539
Why not advice her now?

1231
01:19:49,751 --> 01:19:51,343
Please accept it.

1232
01:19:51,553 --> 01:19:52,850
Why are you thinking so much?

1233
01:19:53,055 --> 01:19:54,079
Take it.

1234
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:06,228
How dare! You promised
to leave this place!

1235
01:20:06,435 --> 01:20:08,926
Are you presenting a gift
to the girl l love?

1236
01:20:09,371 --> 01:20:11,999
Varadha, cut the tongue
which lied to me.

1237
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:17,009
Please open the gift and see!

1238
01:20:21,717 --> 01:20:22,445
Gift...

1239
01:20:24,186 --> 01:20:24,914
Leave him.

1240
01:20:25,854 --> 01:20:27,014
Let's hear him.

1241
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:30,453
You were trying to cut my tongue
for presenting a gift,

1242
01:20:30,892 --> 01:20:32,484
did you open the gift
to see what's inside?

1243
01:20:32,694 --> 01:20:34,355
<i>Open and see it.</i>

1244
01:20:34,763 --> 01:20:45,731
<font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=DARKORANGE size=40> Z!@ <font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=BLUE size=40> ~  <font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=GREEN size=40> Am@n

1245
01:20:46,241 --> 01:20:47,333
- Take it.
- No need sir.

1246
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:48,201
Have it.

1247
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:51,869
How did you get this idea?

1248
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,548
l was about to leave this place,

1249
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:57,480
l wanted to unite you both
before leaving this place.

1250
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,119
But you were hasty as usual.

1251
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:01,551
And he punches before he speaks.

1252
01:21:01,757 --> 01:21:04,817
l've seen white Taj Mahal,
why a black Taj?

1253
01:21:05,026 --> 01:21:05,958
Look!

1254
01:21:06,161 --> 01:21:07,958
Hello brother!
Do you know about Taj Mahal?

1255
01:21:08,163 --> 01:21:10,427
lsn't it the place where Muslims
offer prayers?

1256
01:21:10,632 --> 01:21:13,157
He doesn't know the difference
between mosque and Taj Mahal?

1257
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:15,859
Shahjahan wanted to build
a black Taj Mahal,

1258
01:21:16,071 --> 01:21:19,234
and die in it watching
the white Taj Mahal,

1259
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:22,808
but his son Aurangazeb imprisoned
him and quashed his dreams.

1260
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:25,844
l thought of changing her mind
telling her all these tales.

1261
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:29,141
Before that you came
and ruined everything.

1262
01:21:29,351 --> 01:21:33,754
Sir, you're fast like Jet Li films and
l'm poetic like Bharathiraja's film.

1263
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:37,316
l'm basically village but
extraordinary knowledge.

1264
01:21:37,526 --> 01:21:38,458
Knowledge means?

1265
01:21:39,861 --> 01:21:42,193
Having three meals a day
and sleeping like log.

1266
01:21:44,866 --> 01:21:48,393
Madhu must understand me,
what should l do?

1267
01:21:48,603 --> 01:21:53,631
Sending rocket to space is easy,
but trapping a girl is difficult.

1268
01:21:54,209 --> 01:21:55,938
She must love me.

1269
01:21:58,380 --> 01:21:59,870
What should l do for it?

1270
01:22:00,982 --> 01:22:01,880
Tell me.

1271
01:22:02,317 --> 01:22:03,944
Leave her to me.

1272
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:06,448
What did you say?

1273
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,223
l said leave the problem to me.

1274
01:22:09,424 --> 01:22:11,551
10 or 15 days, she'll be yours.

1275
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:12,488
Can you do it?

1276
01:22:12,694 --> 01:22:14,025
Decided to become a pimp,
no backing off.

1277
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:16,891
Stay here only,
take as much money as you want.

1278
01:22:19,034 --> 01:22:19,932
l want my Madhu.

1279
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:23,070
Book a room in star hotel,
l'll start working from there.

1280
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:24,397
Boss, phone for you.

1281
01:22:27,843 --> 01:22:28,571
Tell me boss.

1282
01:22:29,177 --> 01:22:30,872
- Do whatever he wants.
- Okay boss, Thanks brother.

1283
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:33,912
<i>Tell me ACP, if you can't do it,</i>
<i>l'll talk to DC...</i>

1284
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:38,585
l don't know with what plan you've
entered this house,

1285
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:41,984
but l'll not let you do anything
against my boss.

1286
01:22:46,061 --> 01:22:49,292
ls it? Can't l do anything
till you're here?

1287
01:22:49,497 --> 01:22:51,931
Okay...go...go.

1288
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:56,161
For a Tsunami affected man,
a cyclone is nothing.

1289
01:22:57,205 --> 01:22:59,935
Bloody...censor cut.

1290

1291
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:23,820
Stop!

1292
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:24,589
- Take the tip.
- Thank you sir.

1293
01:23:24,799 --> 01:23:25,663
Have a drink.

1294
01:23:25,867 --> 01:23:28,495
Hey foreigner! Take the lndian currency.
Enjoy!

1295
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:30,000
l want only dollars.

1296
01:23:33,241 --> 01:23:35,175
Take Lord Murugan dollar, visit Palani.

1297
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:36,804
Hey what man?

1298
01:23:37,245 --> 01:23:39,577
Money is making white man
also to speak in Tamil.

1299
01:23:39,981 --> 01:23:41,141
Oh my Jesus!

1300
01:23:45,487 --> 01:23:46,886
- Where's the lift going?
- Ground floor.

1301
01:23:47,088 --> 01:23:48,316
- Will it not go to airport?
- Stupid!

1302
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:50,286
ldiot! Bloody costume!

1303
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:05,763
Can l ask a thing sir?

1304
01:24:05,974 --> 01:24:07,464
l poured itjust now,
should've asked little earlier?

1305
01:24:07,676 --> 01:24:11,203
Not that sir, you're alone,
but ordered two juices,

1306
01:24:11,413 --> 01:24:13,540
you pour down one
and having one,

1307
01:24:13,748 --> 01:24:14,874
l'm not able to get you.

1308
01:24:18,987 --> 01:24:21,888
You'll get a thing in life
only if you lose another thing.

1309
01:24:22,424 --> 01:24:23,686
- Am l right?
- Correct sir.

1310
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:25,951
- Thank you...thank you...
- l must quit this job.

1311
01:24:31,967 --> 01:24:32,763
Thank you sir.

1312
01:24:35,537 --> 01:24:36,333
Take it.

1313
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:37,560
Hello, excuse me.

1314
01:24:38,106 --> 01:24:40,336
Hello, he's MD of this hotel.

1315
01:24:43,244 --> 01:24:44,541
l'm going little over the board, right?

1316
01:24:47,115 --> 01:24:48,446
Nobody must know about this.

1317
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:55,516
- l'm ready, is the car ready?
- <i>Coming, Madhav.</i>

1318
01:24:55,724 --> 01:24:56,656
Quick...quick...

1319
01:25:09,637 --> 01:25:10,569
Thank you sir.

1320
01:25:11,873 --> 01:25:13,773
Don't you know to hold
an umbrella for a VlP?

1321
01:25:13,975 --> 01:25:16,739
- Who sir?
- Great insult.

1322
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:17,673
Myself!

1323
01:25:25,186 --> 01:25:25,914
You thought something now, right?

1324
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:27,247
Nothing sir.

1325
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:28,854
No, you thought something.

1326
01:25:29,057 --> 01:25:30,388
Nothing sir.

1327
01:25:30,592 --> 01:25:31,251
Tell me brother.

1328
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:35,020
They say new rich will
boast too much!

1329
01:25:35,764 --> 01:25:39,530
But l get rich l'll hold an umbrella
even in my honeymoon.

1330
01:25:40,668 --> 01:25:42,101
Car must come to my room
from tomorrow.

1331
01:25:44,672 --> 01:25:45,536
Just for fun!

1332
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:46,804

l trusted you so much,
you've belied all my hopes.

1335
01:26:18,073 --> 01:26:20,439
You too have joined
the ranks of Sivamani.

1336
01:26:20,909 --> 01:26:23,400
Yuck! l hate to see you.

1337
01:26:23,978 --> 01:26:25,206
Never again show your face to me.

1338
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:30,443
lf you hadn't saved his life
from a speeding water lorry,

1339
01:26:30,652 --> 01:26:32,483
he would be dead by now.

1340
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:35,679
You showed pity and
he's boasting!

1341
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:38,552
Come, let's go.
He joined the goons.

1342
01:26:42,063 --> 01:26:44,588
Look, in next 24 hours,

1343
01:26:44,799 --> 01:26:51,602
l'll ruin Sivamani's power, respect,
his political reach,

1344
01:26:51,806 --> 01:26:53,330
and make him laughing stock,

1345
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:56,567
play his funeral band,
ruin his evil empire,

1346
01:26:56,778 --> 01:26:59,076
and let you study peacefully
in this college,

1347
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:00,838
and make you earn a gold medal,

1348
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:05,679
my name henceforth shall not be...

1349
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:11,184
My name shall not be Madhav!
That's what you want to say.

1350
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,187
We've seen it many films.

1351
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:16,727
l wrote it spending
entire night sleepless.

1352
01:27:16,931 --> 01:27:19,456
l think l gave the script
instead of tip.

1353
01:27:20,802 --> 01:27:24,033
l too want to deliver such dialogues
with Sivamani in low angle,

1354
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:27,106
but he'll gun us down
and walk away.

1355
01:27:27,408 --> 01:27:28,875
Think practically.

1356
01:27:29,077 --> 01:27:32,945
lnstead of doing something silly
and die in his hands,

1357
01:27:33,148 --> 01:27:34,740
must learn to live smartly,

1358
01:27:34,949 --> 01:27:36,143
that's my style.

1359
01:27:36,351 --> 01:27:39,377
You don't look like hero.

1360
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:44,718
l was happy to hear punch dialogues
but you're shivering.

1361
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:48,555
Sister, l'm not a six pack hero
like Surya or Vishal,

1362
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:51,459
single pack, just now started
to go to gym.

1363
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:56,097
Look, we must hit sixers and fours
when we get a chance like Dhoni,

1364
01:27:56,304 --> 01:27:58,966
if not sit tight like a saint,

1365
01:27:59,807 --> 01:28:02,071
till yesterday l was your friend,

1366
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:03,744
now l'm an enemy,

1367
01:28:04,445 --> 01:28:07,141
it's not important how we
appear to others,

1368
01:28:07,682 --> 01:28:10,082
what we achieve in the end counts.

1369
01:28:10,518 --> 01:28:15,979
ln another 10 or 15 days, l'll see
that Sivamani forgets about you.

1370
01:28:19,394 --> 01:28:20,326
Trust me...please.

1371
01:28:20,862 --> 01:28:21,692
l'll trust you, Madhav.

1372
01:28:21,896 --> 01:28:25,923
One more thing, stay away from
this sintex tank in jeans.

1373
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:27,931
lt is affecting your personality.

1374
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:31,003
What did you? l'll beat you...

1375
01:28:37,212 --> 01:28:40,238
You've been dicing shells since
morning but said nothing,

1376
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:44,748
Tandoori....sorry Namboodri,
will my boss' love succeed or fail?

1377
01:28:44,953 --> 01:28:51,950
Sir, there's a chance of
your love working out.

1378
01:28:52,727 --> 01:28:56,857
- But there's a big hitch too.
- What's that?

1379
01:28:57,065 --> 01:29:00,364
ln your previous birth,
you were born in Madurai,

1380
01:29:00,568 --> 01:29:02,263
you had a daughter,

1381
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:04,404
her name was Aishwarya,

1382
01:29:04,606 --> 01:29:06,836
she was your life,

1383
01:29:07,041 --> 01:29:09,976
but she fell in love with
mechanic Murugan,

1384
01:29:10,178 --> 01:29:14,877
you used caste to beat the boy
and split the lovers.

1385
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:17,748
lt left him mad.

1386
01:29:18,553 --> 01:29:19,247
Muruga!

1387
01:29:19,454 --> 01:29:22,116
lt's him who became mad.

1388
01:29:22,323 --> 01:29:26,885
Was l a beast in my previous birth?

1389
01:29:27,262 --> 01:29:29,958
Oh! l feel embarrassed to think.

1390
01:30:43,371 --> 01:30:45,066
Who is he?
Why did he try to kill you?

1391
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:47,798
l told about burning a man for Madhu,
he was that guy.

1392
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:49,106
l would be dead!

1393
01:30:49,577 --> 01:30:50,874
Where were you all these days?

1394
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:53,008
Ask me whatever you want...
come on ask.

1395
01:30:53,214 --> 01:30:54,340
l don't want anything.

1396
01:30:54,549 --> 01:30:57,347
No, ask me anything.
l'm very happy.

1397
01:30:58,720 --> 01:30:59,744
Shall we have a drink?

1398
01:31:01,322 --> 01:31:03,620
Notjust drink,
let's take a bath in it.

1399
01:31:03,825 --> 01:31:04,757
Come Madhav.

1400
01:31:07,517 --> 01:31:08,142
Who is it?

1401
01:31:08,351 --> 01:31:09,978
- Hi!
- You?

1402
01:31:10,186 --> 01:31:11,881
- Hi boss!
- What boss?

1403
01:31:12,088 --> 01:31:13,612
Why are you chasing me in a car?

1404
01:31:13,823 --> 01:31:15,723
To strip me naked.

1405
01:31:15,925 --> 01:31:17,256
Get lost!

1406
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:20,588
When l'm rich,
why are you struggling on roads?

1407
01:31:20,797 --> 01:31:22,458
- Come.
- l'll not come.

1408
01:31:22,665 --> 01:31:23,825
l'll not go without you.

1409
01:31:24,033 --> 01:31:27,059
How can l trust you? How do l know
where you'll take me to?

1410
01:31:27,937 --> 01:31:29,234
lt means you don't trust me.

1411
01:31:29,606 --> 01:31:30,334
Then, you drive the car.

1412
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:33,805
Why? l can't drive, so get me involved
in an accident and escape.

1413
01:31:34,010 --> 01:31:36,137
You can't trap me, go away.

1414
01:31:36,512 --> 01:31:40,414
lf anyone trusts me, l'll give my life
and never take their life.

1415
01:31:40,617 --> 01:31:41,549
l know you well.

1416
01:31:41,751 --> 01:31:43,048
l'm there for you,
trust me and get in.

1417
01:31:43,253 --> 01:31:46,017
Already l'm pauper trusting you,
how can l trust you again?

1418
01:31:46,222 --> 01:31:51,421
Come in boss...come in boss...
get into the car boss.

1419
01:31:53,563 --> 01:31:55,531
Neither l can get in nor get out.

1420
01:31:55,732 --> 01:31:58,360
Get me down.
My stomach is upset.

1421
01:31:58,568 --> 01:31:59,535
Get down boss.

1422
01:32:01,204 --> 01:32:04,105
Why did you dump me in like a pig?

1423
01:32:04,307 --> 01:32:06,502
Which area is this?
Whose house is it?

1424
01:32:06,776 --> 01:32:08,641
My present boss' home!

1425
01:32:08,911 --> 01:32:13,143
Present boss? So you've
found another fool like me.

1426
01:32:13,716 --> 01:32:15,047
Okay...but who is he?

1427
01:32:15,685 --> 01:32:18,552
- Raipur Sivamani!
- Raipur Sivamani?

1428
01:32:18,855 --> 01:32:22,256
He's not a fool but a goon!

1429
01:32:22,458 --> 01:32:26,292
Why did you get me into the car?
You could've run the car over me.

1430
01:32:26,629 --> 01:32:28,324
ls it? Oh l missed!

1431
01:32:28,531 --> 01:32:29,793
What's that reaction?

1432
01:32:29,999 --> 01:32:31,159
Let's discuss it later.

1433
01:32:31,367 --> 01:32:32,732
Stop...stop...

1434
01:32:35,104 --> 01:32:38,039
l think l'm trapped in
a very dangerous place.

1435
01:32:38,241 --> 01:32:41,904
Goddess Kali! Open the gate!

1436
01:32:42,111 --> 01:32:43,874
Your child is scared!

1437
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:45,138
- Mister Deepawali.
- Who is it?

1438
01:32:45,348 --> 01:32:46,815
- lt's me.
- Who me?

1439
01:32:47,684 --> 01:32:48,514
You...?

1440
01:32:48,918 --> 01:32:50,044
Actually, this is one way.

1441
01:32:50,420 --> 01:32:52,411
Only incoming, no outgoing.

1442
01:32:53,423 --> 01:32:58,918
lf you dare cross this border,
there's a Doberman waiting outside.

1443
01:32:59,829 --> 01:33:02,354
lt'll aim and pluck it out.

1444
01:33:02,565 --> 01:33:03,623
With the bunch?

1445
01:33:03,833 --> 01:33:04,390
Come.

1446
01:33:11,541 --> 01:33:15,033
Didn't l tell about a man who
beheaded his wife? That's him.

1447
01:33:15,244 --> 01:33:16,871
ls it him?

1448
01:33:17,180 --> 01:33:19,114
Come, this side.

1449
01:33:20,650 --> 01:33:23,551
- Buddy, it's him!
- Yes, it's him!

1450
01:33:23,753 --> 01:33:24,515
Who?

1451
01:33:24,721 --> 01:33:28,521
Don't call him informally,
he's my ex-boss.

1452
01:33:29,292 --> 01:33:33,422
What? lf he's your boss,
then who is the man here?

1453
01:33:33,896 --> 01:33:36,296
Look at his face! Bloody nose!

1454
01:33:40,703 --> 01:33:45,800
Did they ask you now?
Did l ask you tell them?

1455
01:33:46,008 --> 01:33:50,240
They are the people who cleaned up
my shop, why are you telling them?

1456
01:33:50,446 --> 01:33:55,008
No need to introduce me,
they all know me.

1457
01:33:55,218 --> 01:33:56,515
Come quietly.

1458
01:33:56,719 --> 01:33:57,811
- Boss...

1459
01:34:37,075 --> 01:34:38,599
He's struggling now.

1460
01:34:38,977 --> 01:34:40,604
Can we take him as an assistant?

1461
01:34:41,045 --> 01:34:42,171
lf he's okay to you, l don't mind.

1462
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:45,247
l don't know what he's planning.

1463
01:34:46,885 --> 01:34:47,783
He's staring at me again.

1464
01:34:47,986 --> 01:34:48,975
Thanks, boss.

1465
01:34:49,187 --> 01:34:50,814
Boss has agreed to take you
as an assistant.

1466
01:34:51,022 --> 01:34:53,513
- l should agree not him.
- Lower your voice.

1467
01:34:53,725 --> 01:34:59,925
l was your boss and you worked
for me, l'm a boss always.

1468
01:35:00,131 --> 01:35:02,895
Tell your boss to rebuild my shop.

1469
01:35:05,069 --> 01:35:06,730
Should l ask him to rebuild it
and seek your forgiveness?

1470
01:35:06,938 --> 01:35:08,633
l didn't say that,
just say what l told you,

1471
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:10,398
if you say anything beyond that,

1472
01:35:10,608 --> 01:35:14,100
l'll tell him why you're with him and
turn the table on you, be careful.

1473
01:35:14,312 --> 01:35:16,610
Why are you getting tensed for this?

1474
01:35:16,814 --> 01:35:19,112
lf you've that fear,
just tell him what l told you now.

1475
01:35:19,984 --> 01:35:23,511
l want to help Deepawali but
he's trying put me in trouble.

1476
01:35:23,721 --> 01:35:26,417
What is your ex-boss saying, Madhav?

1477
01:35:26,791 --> 01:35:30,420
lt seems he'll not work for you,
and he'll be the boss here also,

1478
01:35:30,628 --> 01:35:32,653
that too boss to you also,

1479
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:33,762
because it seems he
doesn't like your face.

1480
01:35:33,965 --> 01:35:36,490
No, l didn't say like that,
he's lying.

1481
01:35:36,801 --> 01:35:37,495
Good!

1482
01:35:38,202 --> 01:35:40,830
- Boss to me also.
- What is he taking out?

1483
01:35:41,039 --> 01:35:43,701
Two bosses can't be under one roof.

1484
01:35:43,908 --> 01:35:45,535
Pistol!

1485
01:35:45,743 --> 01:35:47,870
l must clear you out.

1486
01:35:48,346 --> 01:35:50,041
Clean me?

1487
01:35:59,223 --> 01:36:01,123
Boss, he excreted in his pants!

1488
01:36:01,793 --> 01:36:03,454
Don't spare him for that, boss.

1489
01:36:05,563 --> 01:36:08,623
No problem, wash him clean
and keep him inside.

1490
01:36:09,267 --> 01:36:12,964
- What did l do? l was sitting tight.
- Take him away.

1491
01:36:13,171 --> 01:36:15,969
- You showed the pistol and...
- He's a good man...

1492
01:36:17,342 --> 01:36:19,367
Did you meet Madhu?
What did she say?

1493
01:36:19,677 --> 01:36:24,205
l met and discussed with her,
we don't need 15 days also,

1494
01:36:24,549 --> 01:36:26,414
- l'll get her acceptance before that.
- ls it?

1495
01:36:27,251 --> 01:36:32,188
Please, don't send these dangerous
looking goons after sister-in-law.

1496
01:36:32,390 --> 01:36:33,584
Sister-in-law hates them.

1497
01:36:35,126 --> 01:36:37,094
Only then l move freely with her.

1498
01:36:37,528 --> 01:36:49,497
<font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=DARKORANGE size=40> Z!@ <font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=BLUE size=40> ~  <font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=GREEN size=40> Am@n

1499
01:36:50,375 --> 01:36:54,402
What did you say? Can't l do
anything till you're with boss?

1500
01:36:54,645 --> 01:36:59,378
Mine is not gym developed
body like yours,

1501
01:36:59,584 --> 01:37:03,350
l developed this body eating natural
food and working hard on fields.

1502
01:37:07,125 --> 01:37:07,921
Drink!

1503
01:37:09,127 --> 01:37:09,786
Drink!

1504
01:37:20,204 --> 01:37:22,001
How long have you been
in love with sister-in-law?

1505
01:37:22,874 --> 01:37:24,569
What's this sudden question?

1506
01:37:24,776 --> 01:37:25,868
3 years!

1507
01:37:30,348 --> 01:37:33,112
lt's not love, it's penance.

1508
01:37:33,317 --> 01:37:37,651
What will you do if you find a man with
sister-in-law's name on his chest?

1509
01:37:38,156 --> 01:37:41,091
l'll gun him down and
shred him to pieces.

1510
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:43,721
Oh! lf l tell you'll become a killer,

1511
01:37:43,928 --> 01:37:45,953
if l don't tell you,
l'll become a betrayer.

1512
01:37:46,164 --> 01:37:47,495
What happened, Madhav?

1513
01:37:47,999 --> 01:37:51,662
Look at him boss, he has tattooed
sister-in-law's name on his chest.

1514
01:37:52,336 --> 01:37:54,930
When l asked him
why are you betraying boss?

1515
01:37:55,139 --> 01:37:56,572
He says Madhu is his wife.

1516
01:37:57,442 --> 01:38:01,208
- Betrayer! Leave my hand Madhav...
- Boss...leave it.

1517
01:38:01,412 --> 01:38:03,039
ls he worth to be killed by you?

1518
01:38:03,247 --> 01:38:05,579
Who will protect sister-in-law
if you go to jail,

1519
01:38:06,017 --> 01:38:09,919
what? He says he'll
kidnap sister-in-law.

1520
01:38:10,488 --> 01:38:12,319
Give it to me...give me...

1521
01:38:12,523 --> 01:38:14,718
Boss, l'll take care of him, you go.

1522
01:38:15,593 --> 01:38:17,584
Tell him to go away, else he'll die.

1523
01:38:17,795 --> 01:38:19,387
- Tell him to go away!
- l'll tell him

1524
01:38:21,132 --> 01:38:23,692
Boss, he's lying...

1525
01:38:25,336 --> 01:38:27,361
He's so possessive about Madhu.

1526
01:38:27,572 --> 01:38:28,834
Let me check his heart too.

1527
01:38:37,715 --> 01:38:40,013
ls the key to the lock here?

1528
01:38:41,953 --> 01:38:42,749
Let me see.

1529
01:38:47,125 --> 01:38:50,458
l checkmated you! That's Madhav style!

1530
01:38:50,995 --> 01:38:51,927
Tell me Madhav, what's the matter?

1531
01:38:52,130 --> 01:38:56,590
l offered special prayers for you at
Tiruchi Goddess Mangaduamman temple.

1532
01:38:56,801 --> 01:38:59,133
What?
Tiruchi Goddess Mangaduamman temple?

1533
01:38:59,337 --> 01:39:01,464
Mangadu is here. Near Chennai.

1534
01:39:01,839 --> 01:39:04,205
Are you telling truth? No, l think so.

1535
01:39:04,408 --> 01:39:05,773
ls it near Chennai?

1536
01:39:05,977 --> 01:39:07,877
l felt l travelled a long distance.

1537
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:10,742
Tiruchi buses overtook my bus.

1538
01:39:10,948 --> 01:39:13,143
Neither you went to Tiruchi
nor to Mangadu,

1539
01:39:13,351 --> 01:39:15,114
which Ganesha temple did you visit?

1540
01:39:15,686 --> 01:39:19,486
That's what l like in you!
What a knowledge!

1541
01:39:19,690 --> 01:39:23,091
l don't know where l may go,
but l wish is you must study well.

1542
01:39:23,294 --> 01:39:24,659
What's in the paper?

1543
01:39:25,196 --> 01:39:25,719
Vermilion!

1544
01:39:25,930 --> 01:39:27,522
- Under it?
- Paper!

1545
01:39:28,332 --> 01:39:30,493
l asked what's in between them.

1546
01:39:30,701 --> 01:39:31,429
What?

1547
01:39:32,136 --> 01:39:33,000
You read it.

1548
01:39:33,704 --> 01:39:34,728
You read it for me.

1549
01:39:34,939 --> 01:39:36,236
l love you is written on it.

1550
01:39:37,074 --> 01:39:37,733
What does it mean?

1551
01:39:37,942 --> 01:39:39,307
Don't you know what is l love you?

1552
01:39:41,212 --> 01:39:42,076
Don't l know?

1553
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:44,510
l love you means
l'm in love with you.

1554
01:39:45,516 --> 01:39:46,244
ls it?

1555
01:39:46,984 --> 01:39:49,509
- What's your opinion about love?
- Why?

1556
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:51,085
Just for GK.

1557
01:39:51,889 --> 01:39:53,914
ls it GK to you to know about love?

1558
01:39:54,559 --> 01:39:56,424
Okay, if you don't like, leave it.

1559
01:39:56,928 --> 01:39:59,362
Sivamani's men don't follow
you anymore, right?

1560
01:39:59,564 --> 01:40:00,826
- No.
- That's great!

1561
01:40:02,099 --> 01:40:03,361
They will not follow you hereafter.

1562
01:40:03,568 --> 01:40:06,935
l devised a plan to keep
them off you, that's Madhav!

1563
01:40:07,905 --> 01:40:09,065
Sivamani himself came here.

1564
01:40:11,242 --> 01:40:11,970
What?

1565
01:40:12,176 --> 01:40:14,906
Yes, around 2 am after midnight,

1566
01:40:15,112 --> 01:40:20,641
he tortured me saying he's unable
to sleep and wants to see me.

1567
01:40:22,253 --> 01:40:27,088
l've to write exams in 10 days,
please do something, Madhav.

1568
01:40:30,561 --> 01:40:35,225
Notjust these 10 days, Sivamani will
never cross your life again.

1569
01:40:35,433 --> 01:40:36,400
l'll ensure it.

1570
01:40:40,137 --> 01:40:41,832
What are you saying?
Kill me in an encounter?

1571
01:40:42,006 --> 01:40:44,406
Yes, l got nervous on hearing it.

1572
01:40:45,810 --> 01:40:48,074
Madhav, it's been years since
l gave up criminal life.

1573
01:40:48,613 --> 01:40:51,980
You gave up, but they've unearthed
old pending cases against you.

1574
01:40:52,183 --> 01:40:53,411
They would've announced
in newspapers, right?

1575
01:40:53,618 --> 01:40:54,983
<i>That's police trend.</i>

1576
01:40:55,186 --> 01:40:56,278
<i>Don't you know it, boss?</i>

1577
01:40:56,487 --> 01:40:59,047
They'll bump you off first and
then announce in newspapers.

1578
01:40:59,257 --> 01:41:01,748
Why is he trying to scare Sivamani?

1579
01:41:02,793 --> 01:41:04,488
He's a born criminal.

1580
01:41:04,695 --> 01:41:06,128
'Bullet' Suri, who died
in an encounter,

1581
01:41:06,330 --> 01:41:07,695
whom did he meet last before dying?

1582
01:41:07,898 --> 01:41:08,830
He met me.

1583
01:41:09,033 --> 01:41:09,829
What did he say to you?

1584
01:41:10,034 --> 01:41:11,934
He said Tamil Nadu police
is in his pocket.

1585
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:14,160
He claimed nobody could
dare touch him.

1586
01:41:15,339 --> 01:41:16,601
Who killed him?

1587
01:41:17,875 --> 01:41:19,433
lsn't it the same Tamil Nadu police?

1588
01:41:21,212 --> 01:41:24,340
lnstead of sowing in fields,
he's sowing trouble here.

1589
01:41:24,982 --> 01:41:25,914
He's dead!

1590
01:41:26,417 --> 01:41:28,009
Let me see what is he up to.

1591
01:41:31,255 --> 01:41:32,517
Onion!

1592
01:41:33,991 --> 01:41:37,449
lnstead of using it for cooking,
he's squeezing it into eyes.

1593
01:41:38,529 --> 01:41:41,089
Why is crying using a onion?

1594
01:41:41,299 --> 01:41:43,460
ls he trying to make Sivamani
also a useless man like me?

1595
01:41:43,668 --> 01:41:46,136
l know how much you love Madhu.

1596
01:41:47,204 --> 01:41:50,196
But l love you more than it.

1597
01:41:51,042 --> 01:41:54,136
lf anything happens to you,
l can't bear it, boss.

1598
01:41:54,345 --> 01:41:55,334
Wipe your tears.

1599
01:41:55,546 --> 01:41:57,514
What an acting!

1600
01:41:57,715 --> 01:42:02,709
Unable to see this acting,
legendary actor Sivaji died early.

1601
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:04,444
Okay, tell me what should l do now?

1602
01:42:04,655 --> 01:42:08,056
Very simple, most of the goons
are based in Mumbai.

1603
01:42:08,259 --> 01:42:08,884
Okay.

1604
01:42:09,093 --> 01:42:11,254
Why are you struggling alone here?

1605
01:42:11,462 --> 01:42:12,520
You too join that group.

1606
01:42:12,730 --> 01:42:14,061
He has given him an idea.

1607
01:42:16,133 --> 01:42:17,122
What are you thinking?

1608
01:42:17,335 --> 01:42:19,166
l can't live without seeing Madhu.

1609
01:42:19,370 --> 01:42:21,235
Am l asking you to forever?

1610
01:42:21,605 --> 01:42:24,403
Just stay there for 10 days,
problem here will get solved,

1611
01:42:24,608 --> 01:42:27,475
l'll talk to sister-in-law and
make her accept you.

1612
01:42:27,678 --> 01:42:30,647
He's telling him that he'll get
her acceptance for himself,

1613
01:42:30,848 --> 01:42:32,440
and this lousy fool is believing him.

1614
01:42:33,217 --> 01:42:35,742
You show all your power
with weaker men like me,

1615
01:42:35,953 --> 01:42:37,545
you get weakened
by such tricksters.

1616
01:42:38,155 --> 01:42:39,087
Get lost!

1617
01:42:39,290 --> 01:42:40,689
Brother, when you come back,

1618
01:42:40,891 --> 01:42:42,791
sister-in-law would've
agreed for the marriage.

1619
01:42:43,561 --> 01:42:45,495
Okay, l think you're right.

1620
01:42:45,696 --> 01:42:47,095
Arrange for Mumbai travel.

1621
01:42:48,366 --> 01:42:53,099
He was scaring him about
some news, what's that?

1622
01:42:54,538 --> 01:42:56,768
This is last year's newspaper.

1623
01:42:56,974 --> 01:43:01,741
Bloody crook! l heard about people
sweeping under the nose,

1624
01:43:01,946 --> 01:43:04,540
he's taking things right before eyes.

1625
01:43:17,628 --> 01:43:18,560
lce cream?

1626
01:43:19,029 --> 01:43:22,192
- No, l'm having cold.
- Good!

1627
01:43:25,503 --> 01:43:27,095
lt's from Madhav.

1628
01:43:27,304 --> 01:43:28,931
Don't answer the call.

1629
01:43:29,907 --> 01:43:31,932
He'll narrate a tale for
not answering it.

1630
01:43:33,544 --> 01:43:35,409
- Hello...
- l'm Madhav here.

1631
01:43:36,046 --> 01:43:36,512
Tell me.

1632
01:43:36,714 --> 01:43:37,840
Where are you now?

1633
01:43:38,182 --> 01:43:39,012
ln college.

1634
01:43:39,216 --> 01:43:40,615
l want to talk to you.

1635
01:43:41,018 --> 01:43:42,042
l've special class.

1636
01:43:42,253 --> 01:43:44,221
You're worried about special class,

1637
01:43:44,422 --> 01:43:47,289
l've done a greatjob for you
stooping down to low level.

1638
01:43:47,491 --> 01:43:49,186
l must see you now.

1639
01:43:49,493 --> 01:43:50,687
Can you come in 10 minutes?

1640
01:43:50,895 --> 01:43:52,487
No, l must see you right now.

1641
01:43:52,696 --> 01:43:53,890
How can immediately?

1642
01:43:54,265 --> 01:43:55,789
Turn around and see.

1643
01:43:57,401 --> 01:43:57,958
Hi!

1644
01:44:02,039 --> 01:44:03,063
Why did you throw it?

1645
01:44:03,274 --> 01:44:04,605
He makes fun of me always,

1646
01:44:04,809 --> 01:44:07,471
if he sees me with
two ice creams, l'm dead.

1647
01:44:07,678 --> 01:44:09,305
Let it go, my fate.

1648
01:44:09,713 --> 01:44:10,441
lt went waste.

1649
01:44:10,648 --> 01:44:12,240
Why did you throw the ice cream?

1650
01:44:12,616 --> 01:44:14,777
lt burnt my hand and l dropped it.

1651
01:44:14,985 --> 01:44:16,714
You won't pick it again
after l leave, right?

1652
01:44:17,922 --> 01:44:19,412
What's it, Madhav?
What's the matter?

1653
01:44:20,257 --> 01:44:23,784
- Sivamani...
- Gone?

1654
01:44:24,195 --> 01:44:26,425
For the present l've sent
him to Mumbai.

1655
01:44:26,630 --> 01:44:28,154
He'll come back after
10 or 15 days only.

1656
01:44:28,365 --> 01:44:29,559
Thank you very much.

1657
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:31,868
Write your exams without any tension.

1658
01:44:32,069 --> 01:44:34,230
Then, take this.

1659
01:44:35,005 --> 01:44:35,835
What is it?

1660
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:37,268
Open it, you'll know.

1661
01:44:38,075 --> 01:44:39,042
Silly!

1662
01:44:42,513 --> 01:44:43,207
What's this?

1663
01:44:43,414 --> 01:44:44,210
This is too much.

1664
01:44:44,415 --> 01:44:45,609
l knew about him.

1665
01:44:45,816 --> 01:44:47,283
He's a womaniser.

1666
01:44:47,485 --> 01:44:48,850
Am l your wife?

1667
01:44:49,053 --> 01:44:50,520
To get me sweet and flowers.

1668
01:44:50,721 --> 01:44:52,086
This is nonsense.

1669
01:44:53,324 --> 01:44:57,055
Madhu...did you see sweet?
Film 'Amaithipadai'!

1670
01:44:58,162 --> 01:45:00,323
Sweet means 'Amaithipadai',
drumstick means 'Mundhanai Mudichu'

1671
01:45:00,531 --> 01:45:02,055
jasmine means 'Enga Vooru Pattukaran'?

1672
01:45:02,266 --> 01:45:04,291
Why do you always think wrong?

1673
01:45:04,802 --> 01:45:09,205
lt's just sweet, anybody from 5 year old
to 50 year old woman can eat,

1674
01:45:09,406 --> 01:45:10,065
lt's true!

1675
01:45:10,274 --> 01:45:16,702
Flowers...one can buy it for sisters,
mother, God, or even dead body,

1676
01:45:16,914 --> 01:45:18,848
it's logic,
why do you misunderstand it?

1677
01:45:19,049 --> 01:45:20,676
l didn't want to meet a friend
with empty hands,

1678
01:45:20,885 --> 01:45:23,547
l gave a deep thought about it
and brought sweet and flowers.

1679
01:45:23,754 --> 01:45:27,155
Without feeling happy about it,
both are suspecting an innocent man.

1680
01:45:27,358 --> 01:45:28,120
Go!

1681
01:45:30,995 --> 01:45:35,728
Okay, eat the flower before it gets cold
and sport the sweet in your hair.

1682
01:45:37,034 --> 01:45:39,195
l'm confused seeing you angry.

1683
01:45:39,403 --> 01:45:40,700
Try to understand me atleats now.

1684
01:45:40,905 --> 01:45:41,633
Yes...?

1685
01:45:41,839 --> 01:45:43,272
No doubt, it's yes.

1686
01:45:43,474 --> 01:45:45,635
l was hasty, very sorry.

1687
01:45:45,843 --> 01:45:49,836
Forget it, saying sorry to girls
like you is very easy.

1688
01:45:50,047 --> 01:45:53,414
Young men like me forgetting it
and helping again is routine.

1689
01:45:54,785 --> 01:45:56,150
<i>Can't tolerate this mosquito menace!</i>

1690
01:45:56,353 --> 01:45:58,548
Shall we meet again tomorrow?

1691
01:45:59,557 --> 01:46:00,751
Go away!

1692
01:46:02,359 --> 01:46:03,917
l can't understand him.

1693
01:46:04,128 --> 01:46:07,097
He told his boss that he loves me,

1694
01:46:07,298 --> 01:46:09,766
he tells he's doing it to help me,

1695
01:46:10,034 --> 01:46:12,969
but says he's with Sivamani
for my sake,

1696
01:46:13,170 --> 01:46:14,603
l can'tjudge him at all.

1697
01:46:14,972 --> 01:46:16,200
What's your doubt?

1698
01:46:16,407 --> 01:46:19,274
You want to know if he loves
you or not, right?

1699
01:46:19,710 --> 01:46:21,109
- l'll take care of it.
- How?

1700
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:23,507
No fear when l'm here!

1701
01:46:25,015 --> 01:46:28,507
- l need this.
- What happened?

1702
01:46:28,786 --> 01:46:32,882
l've seen many crooks in my life

1703
01:46:33,090 --> 01:46:37,959
but first time l'm seeing
a crook to the core.

1704
01:46:38,162 --> 01:46:39,561
What did he do?

1705
01:46:39,763 --> 01:46:41,754
He's driving two buses
with one steering.

1706
01:46:41,966 --> 01:46:43,957
Please tell me clearly.

1707
01:46:44,568 --> 01:46:46,331
- Hello!
- Yes!

1708
01:46:46,570 --> 01:46:47,559
Hi!

1709
01:46:47,738 --> 01:46:50,536
Why are you like a bulldozer in a sari?

1710
01:46:52,543 --> 01:46:56,377
l want to tell you something.

1711
01:46:57,214 --> 01:46:58,704
Okay, tell!

1712
01:46:58,916 --> 01:47:00,383
Your speech, your style,

1713
01:47:00,584 --> 01:47:03,712
your walk, your mannerism,
your dressing sense,

1714
01:47:04,254 --> 01:47:08,884
your shoe, socks inside it,
and etc...etc...

1715
01:47:09,093 --> 01:47:11,425
l like all this.

1716
01:47:12,396 --> 01:47:17,231
- So?
- So...l love you!

1717
01:47:18,142 --> 01:47:20,007
Please don't laugh,
building is shaking!

1718
01:47:22,713 --> 01:47:23,737
May l speak to you now?

1719
01:47:24,515 --> 01:47:25,379
Go ahead!

1720
01:47:25,983 --> 01:47:33,788
To be frank, l like your style, structure,
face, eyes, nose, lips, heels,

1721
01:47:34,558 --> 01:47:36,583
l like very much.

1722
01:47:38,529 --> 01:47:42,021
- So...?
- So...?

1723
01:47:42,233 --> 01:47:43,359
l love you too!

1724
01:47:45,002 --> 01:47:47,095
Oh Lord Guruvayurappa!

1725
01:47:47,571 --> 01:47:51,667
You got shocked, right?
l too got shocked like this only.

1726
01:47:52,109 --> 01:47:53,542
What am l to do now with him?

1727
01:47:54,879 --> 01:48:00,112
You don't worry,
there's no monkey that hates fruits,

1728
01:48:00,317 --> 01:48:02,444
there's no man who'll
not fall for money.

1729
01:48:03,187 --> 01:48:07,624
Let's bash him with money
and read his pulse.

1730
01:48:08,626 --> 01:48:09,251
We'll do it!

1731
01:48:12,162 --> 01:48:13,424
- Hi!
- Hi!

1732
01:48:14,064 --> 01:48:16,658
Yesterday you expressed love,
today in park,

1733
01:48:16,867 --> 01:48:18,732
tomorrow in beach,
and then film theatre?

1734
01:48:18,936 --> 01:48:20,870
- l'm having great fun.
- Take it.

1735
01:48:21,071 --> 01:48:22,663
Gift, so early?

1736
01:48:23,374 --> 01:48:24,602
Open and see it.

1737
01:48:24,975 --> 01:48:25,964
l'll see.

1738
01:48:28,012 --> 01:48:30,105
Why so much money?

1739
01:48:30,481 --> 01:48:31,379
For you only.

1740
01:48:32,216 --> 01:48:33,615
Why so much money to me?

1741
01:48:33,851 --> 01:48:37,480
You've helped Madhu a lot,
this is for it.

1742
01:48:37,721 --> 01:48:38,517
For that?

1743
01:48:38,722 --> 01:48:40,883
She asked me to give it as gift.

1744
01:48:41,091 --> 01:48:42,581
How much is it?

1745
01:48:42,793 --> 01:48:43,782
Rs.100 thousands!

1746
01:48:43,994 --> 01:48:44,460
Take it.

1747
01:48:44,662 --> 01:48:47,722
Rs.100 thousands!
Take it.

1748
01:48:49,567 --> 01:48:50,795
Do you know this?

1749
01:48:51,635 --> 01:48:52,727
Back in my native place,

1750
01:48:52,937 --> 01:48:57,897
l'm richer than you, Madhu,
or Sivamani himself.

1751
01:48:58,943 --> 01:49:02,208
Generally people come here
with money from home,

1752
01:49:02,413 --> 01:49:05,576
but l came because of abundance.

1753
01:49:05,783 --> 01:49:09,583
There are millions in Chennai,
why did she save my life only?

1754
01:49:10,788 --> 01:49:15,418
Madhu has many friends and relatives,
but she told her story to me only.

1755
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:17,754
That's known as fate!

1756
01:49:18,062 --> 01:49:19,689
Fate's other name is love.

1757
01:49:20,297 --> 01:49:25,428
Love is every man's search
of the soul lost from him.

1758
01:49:25,970 --> 01:49:28,871
Few are lucky to get it
and others are unlucky.

1759
01:49:29,873 --> 01:49:33,365
l'm lucky,
my love's name is Madhu.

1760
01:49:33,577 --> 01:49:37,946
When Sivamani comes to know this,
l'm sure he'll kill me.

1761
01:49:39,083 --> 01:49:41,779
l don't mind, she saved my life,

1762
01:49:42,553 --> 01:49:48,116
if giving my life can bring happiness
to her, l don't mind losing it.

1763
01:49:48,659 --> 01:49:53,858
My mother gave me life
and Madhu saved it,

1764
01:49:55,099 --> 01:49:59,195
when l leave this place,
l'll go with Madhu only,

1765
01:50:00,170 --> 01:50:02,468
if not l'll die here for her.

1766
01:50:03,173 --> 01:50:09,476
Most of them die for love but
my love started from death.

1767
01:50:12,516 --> 01:50:13,813
Tell your friend.

1770
01:50:40,711 --> 01:50:43,908
After living happily for
5000 years, okay?

1771
01:50:48,385 --> 01:50:49,852

Boss...why did you come back so early?

1808

What have l told you
and what you're doing?

1809
01:55:41,878 --> 01:55:44,676
Madhav, tomorrow is Madhu's birthday,

1810
01:55:45,382 --> 01:55:49,842
every year l give her a gift,
l don't want to miss this year.

1811
01:55:50,053 --> 01:55:51,020
What's this?

1812
01:55:51,421 --> 01:55:54,447
l'm struggling so hard to present you
with sister-in-law herself.

1813
01:55:54,791 --> 01:55:56,520
- But you're rushing in haste.
- What's the bag?

1814
01:55:56,727 --> 01:55:58,194
This bag....nothing...

1815
01:55:59,229 --> 01:56:00,628
- Nothing...
- Show me.

1816
01:56:01,064 --> 01:56:05,125
Caught...he caught with
Sivamani tightly.

1817
01:56:05,335 --> 01:56:11,205
When situation turns red hot,
l must enter to break it.

1818
01:56:11,408 --> 01:56:12,136
What's that?

1819
01:56:12,342 --> 01:56:14,776
- Nothing.
- Give it to me. Boss is asking you, right?

1820
01:56:16,747 --> 01:56:19,215
What's this? All ladies items...

1821
01:56:19,916 --> 01:56:20,883
That is...

1822
01:56:22,085 --> 01:56:22,551
For whom?

1823
01:56:22,753 --> 01:56:25,221
For who else? lt's for your lover only.

1824
01:56:25,422 --> 01:56:29,552
You're backing him up.
l'm talking to myself.

1825
01:56:31,328 --> 01:56:34,126
He's rich but uses cheap tricks.

1826
01:56:34,698 --> 01:56:37,166
Get me quarter kilo onions
for performance.

1827
01:56:37,367 --> 01:56:40,063
Why are you asking me to get it?

1828
01:56:40,270 --> 01:56:41,328
For whom this jeans?

1829
01:56:41,538 --> 01:56:42,232
Mother!

1830
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:44,338
Mother?

1831
01:56:44,541 --> 01:56:50,309
My mother wanted to wearjeans
as a little girl, and asked her father,

1832
01:56:50,981 --> 01:56:53,916
in the name of culture
he dashed her wish,

1833
01:56:54,451 --> 01:56:56,681
later she asked my father,

1834
01:56:57,954 --> 01:57:01,583
but in the name of tradition,
he too shattered her dream,

1835
01:57:01,792 --> 01:57:05,751
nobody fulfilled her wish,
so l thought of fulfilling it,

1836
01:57:05,962 --> 01:57:11,594
all of them have father's genes,
but l've only mother's genes.

1837
01:57:15,138 --> 01:57:16,503
Do you love your mother so much?

1838
01:57:16,706 --> 01:57:20,107
No, my entire love is for mother only.

1839
01:57:20,310 --> 01:57:22,778
Why are you asking
silly questions like me?

1840
01:57:23,180 --> 01:57:25,045
He's repeating the same thing.

1841
01:57:25,248 --> 01:57:28,012
l want to catch him red handed
but he uses some trick,

1842
01:57:28,218 --> 01:57:31,619
body gets out of control
and excretes in pant.

1843
01:57:31,822 --> 01:57:33,119
l'm proud of you.

1844
01:57:33,323 --> 01:57:35,848
Earlier building was strong
but basement was weak,

1845
01:57:36,259 --> 01:57:40,457
now basement weakness is
spreading to building too.

1846
01:57:41,498 --> 01:57:45,127
When l started to excrete
without my knowledge,

1847
01:57:45,635 --> 01:57:48,968
it's better to control
anger and senses.

1848
01:57:54,778 --> 01:57:55,403
Where is Madhu?

1849
01:57:56,580 --> 01:57:57,979
Madhu is not there.
She has gone out.

1850
01:57:58,181 --> 01:57:59,478
- Where did she go?
- l don't know.

1851
01:57:59,683 --> 01:58:01,651
<i>This number is currently switched off.</i>

1852
01:58:01,818 --> 01:58:03,615
<i>Please try again later.</i>

1853
01:58:11,261 --> 01:58:12,159
ldiot!

1854
01:58:12,362 --> 01:58:14,830
Let Rama reign or Ravana...

1855
01:58:15,532 --> 01:58:17,159
There's no country without workers...

1856
01:58:17,367 --> 01:58:19,335
Hello boss! Back to pavilion
in seconds like Ganguly!

1857
01:58:20,537 --> 01:58:21,595
Madhu is not at home.

1858
01:58:21,872 --> 01:58:23,772
Not at home? Then, call her phone.

1859
01:58:24,574 --> 01:58:27,099
- lt's switched off.
- Smart girl, very brave.

1860
01:58:28,211 --> 01:58:30,338
You don't changed your mood,

1861
01:58:30,614 --> 01:58:33,082
come what so ever may
l'll bring sister-in-law to you.

1862
01:58:33,283 --> 01:58:36,844
Okay? You go now.
Come...come...

1863
01:58:40,223 --> 01:58:40,951
Will you bring her?

1864
01:58:41,158 --> 01:58:42,853
l'll definitely bring her.
You carry on.

1865
01:58:43,193 --> 01:58:53,159
<font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=DARKORANGE size=40> Z!@ <font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=BLUE size=40> ~  <font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=GREEN size=40> Am@n

1866
01:58:53,370 --> 01:58:54,166
Birthday happy!

1867
01:58:56,973 --> 01:58:57,997
What did Sivamani say?

1868
01:58:58,542 --> 01:59:00,669
Don't ask me that,
not finding you at home,

1869
01:59:00,877 --> 01:59:03,846
you should've seen his face,
his face was sullen.

1870
01:59:04,714 --> 01:59:05,510
Forget about him.

1871
01:59:05,982 --> 01:59:09,349
You know today is my birthday,
won't you buy a gift for me?

1872
01:59:09,553 --> 01:59:11,680
Hey Madhu! What is this like
an old film heroine?

1873
01:59:11,888 --> 01:59:12,855
Asking for gift and cake.

1874
01:59:13,056 --> 01:59:16,685
For me birthday means
get drunk and sleep like log.

1875
01:59:16,993 --> 01:59:20,360
lf it's okay to you, Pondicherry
is near, let's go, come...

1876
01:59:20,564 --> 01:59:21,792
No way!

1877
01:59:21,998 --> 01:59:25,764
- You want a gift, right?
Close your eyes.- Okay.

1878
01:59:28,672 --> 01:59:29,434
Open your eyes.

1879
01:59:32,576 --> 01:59:34,043
How did you get this?

1880
01:59:34,311 --> 01:59:35,278
This is my phone.

1881
01:59:37,581 --> 01:59:39,549
You saved my life in the accident,

1882
01:59:40,183 --> 01:59:43,550
l gave my heart to you
and took your phone.

1883
01:59:45,088 --> 01:59:47,556
This is my birthday gift to you.

1884
01:59:48,091 --> 01:59:49,888
Okay...what shall we have?

1885
01:59:50,427 --> 01:59:50,893
Fruit salad.

1886
01:59:51,094 --> 01:59:52,994
Two fruit salads for me too.

1887
01:59:54,431 --> 01:59:56,456
- Boss...how come you are here?
- Shut up!

1888
01:59:56,666 --> 02:00:00,830
You finished me completely
and calling boss to tease me.

1889
02:00:01,037 --> 02:00:02,902
This one point is enough,

1890
02:00:03,106 --> 02:00:04,903
you love the girl he loves,
that's enough,

1891
02:00:05,108 --> 02:00:07,076
l'll tell him and finish you.

1892
02:00:07,277 --> 02:00:10,405
Boss, we are youngsters,
why are you getting tensed?

1893
02:00:10,614 --> 02:00:13,742
- Boss...boss...please...
- l'll not spare you...l'll tell him...

1894
02:00:13,950 --> 02:00:15,008
Boss, wait...wait...

1895
02:00:15,418 --> 02:00:17,477
Madhu, talk to him and
calm him down.

1896
02:00:18,722 --> 02:00:21,748
Boss, please don't make it a big issue,
we are poor people, boss,

1897
02:00:21,958 --> 02:00:25,826
Only his name is Madhav
but crook to the core.

1898
02:00:26,029 --> 02:00:30,432
lf you spend too much time
with him, you'll get ruined.

1899
02:00:30,634 --> 02:00:31,100
Thanks boss.

1900
02:00:31,668 --> 02:00:33,431
l'm telling about your true colour.

1901
02:00:33,637 --> 02:00:34,934
Are you thanking me for that?

1902
02:00:35,305 --> 02:00:36,772
For giving a pose.

1903
02:00:37,974 --> 02:00:39,202
Pose?

1904
02:00:39,409 --> 02:00:40,535
What pose?

1905
02:00:40,744 --> 02:00:41,608
Subash Chandra Bose!

1906
02:00:42,078 --> 02:00:42,772
Subash Chandra Bose?

1907
02:00:42,979 --> 02:00:44,503
You were holding her hand, right?

1908
02:00:45,315 --> 02:00:46,179
That pose!

1909
02:00:46,549 --> 02:00:48,449
l may be holding her hand
but the dialogue was different.

1910
02:00:48,652 --> 02:00:50,620
My dialogue with Sivamani
will be quite different.

1911
02:00:50,820 --> 02:00:51,650
What dialogue?

1912
02:00:51,921 --> 02:00:53,286
Holding her hand,

1913
02:00:53,590 --> 02:00:58,459
let's elope and play mother & father
game outside the town,

1914
02:00:58,662 --> 02:00:59,560
l'll tell him you said this.

1915
02:01:01,231 --> 02:01:03,791
Cancel the fruit salad
ordered by boss.

1916
02:01:04,434 --> 02:01:05,628
Blocking the way.

1917
02:01:06,236 --> 02:01:07,294
Heavy like a corpse!

1918
02:01:07,604 --> 02:01:09,731
Why are you standing here?
Come, let's go.

1919
02:01:10,774 --> 02:01:14,972
ln an emotion l held her hands
and he cooked up a tale.

1920
02:01:17,180 --> 02:01:17,805
Boss!

1921
02:01:24,421 --> 02:01:26,150
Look at my boss!
What did he ask from you?

1922
02:01:26,356 --> 02:01:28,551
He wanted to meet you on your
birthday and present a gift.

1923
02:01:28,758 --> 02:01:29,486
ls it wrong?

1924
02:01:29,793 --> 02:01:33,160
Look, l'm not like my boss,
l'll blow your face.

1925
02:01:33,330 --> 02:01:36,322
You're finishing studies and
marrying my boss. Okay?

1926
02:01:37,267 --> 02:01:38,165
You keep quiet, boss.

1927
02:01:38,868 --> 02:01:41,098
After Sivaji's love in
film 'Vasantha Maaligai',

1928
02:01:41,371 --> 02:01:44,829
there's only one love,
it's my boss Sivamani's love.

1929
02:01:50,213 --> 02:01:52,579
You've met sister-in-law,
go and drop her at home, boss.

1930
02:01:53,616 --> 02:01:56,016
- Madhav, you drop her.
- ls it?

1931
02:01:56,219 --> 02:01:56,685
Okay boss.

1932
02:01:56,886 --> 02:01:59,286
Look, my boss doesn't want you
to walk back to home,

1933
02:01:59,489 --> 02:02:02,356
he wants me to drop you.
What a gentleman he's! Come.

1934
02:02:02,559 --> 02:02:05,027
- Boss?
- Okay boss....right.

1935
02:02:07,897 --> 02:02:08,693
Oh my God!

1936
02:02:09,566 --> 02:02:10,863
Happy birthday!

1937
02:02:11,968 --> 02:02:13,868
- Go..go...
- Come..come...

1938
02:02:14,070 --> 02:02:16,038
- You're my brother!
- Come..come...come...

1939
02:02:17,073 --> 02:02:18,540
Sorry dear! Did l go overboard?

1940
02:02:20,410 --> 02:02:22,708
Chicks don't die if hen steps on it!

1941
02:02:23,246 --> 02:02:24,611
Why are you hitting when l'm speaking?

1942
02:02:25,315 --> 02:02:30,150
Your push too didn't hurt me much but
your silly one liners are killing me.

1943
02:02:31,421 --> 02:02:33,218
- Get lost mad girl!
- Get lost wastrel!

1944
02:02:35,024 --> 02:02:35,888
Come closer!

1945
02:02:38,261 --> 02:02:39,888
No song here! Wait!

1946
02:02:44,601 --> 02:02:46,296
What did you've for breakfast?

1947
02:02:47,337 --> 02:02:47,803
ldly!

1948
02:02:48,004 --> 02:02:50,802
ldly means the small round fluffy thing?

1949
02:02:51,608 --> 02:02:53,132
Why are you torturing me early morning?

1950
02:02:54,144 --> 02:02:56,305
Okay, what dress are you wearing now?

1951
02:02:56,846 --> 02:02:57,972
Light yellow colour churidhar!

1952
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:05,488
Where shall we go for our honeymoon?

1953
02:03:05,688 --> 02:03:07,588
- Kulu Manali?
- lt's very cold there.

1954
02:03:07,857 --> 02:03:10,325
- How about Rajasthan?
- lt's very hot there.

1955
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:12,985
How about on Mount road
by afternoon 2 pm?

1956
02:03:13,196 --> 02:03:14,493
Get lost rogue!

1957
02:03:16,199 --> 02:03:18,497
Can't tolerate Dhandapani's torture.

1958
02:03:18,701 --> 02:03:22,501
His face and dress...
please do something.

1959
02:03:22,705 --> 02:03:24,332
Ask Dhandapani to come
to a place l suggest,

1960
02:03:24,541 --> 02:03:25,599
l'll take care of the rest.

1961
02:03:29,379 --> 02:03:31,347
Someone's at the door,
you carry on.

1962
02:03:38,922 --> 02:03:40,287
- Come in boss.
- Who is in the line?

1963
02:03:41,324 --> 02:03:42,689
Nayanthara! Please come in boss.

1964
02:03:42,992 --> 02:03:43,856
Cine artiste?

1965
02:03:44,060 --> 02:03:48,121
No...she studied with me till ninth,
name is Thara.

1966
02:03:48,565 --> 02:03:49,691
That's why Nayanthara.

1967
02:03:51,901 --> 02:03:52,799
What brought you here suddenly?

1968
02:03:53,002 --> 02:03:56,301
l went to habour,
l came down to meet you only.

1969
02:03:58,007 --> 02:03:59,031
ls the room comfortable?

1970
02:03:59,242 --> 02:04:00,539
Room is great!

1971
02:04:03,079 --> 02:04:05,707
- Phone is ringing, answer it.
- Okay, boss.

1972
02:04:09,085 --> 02:04:09,551
Hello...

1973
02:04:09,752 --> 02:04:13,051
- Why did you cut the line?
- l didn't, you did it.

1974
02:04:17,927 --> 02:04:20,327
Low battery, can we talk later?

1975
02:04:23,433 --> 02:04:27,563
You said something
when l hugged you, say it now!

1976
02:04:28,605 --> 02:04:29,572
l said l love you.

1977
02:04:30,273 --> 02:04:31,069
Say it again!

1978
02:04:33,710 --> 02:04:35,575
l love you!

1979
02:04:37,614 --> 02:04:38,080
Who?

1980
02:04:39,115 --> 02:04:41,413
Asking me who? Sister-in-law!

1981
02:04:41,618 --> 02:04:43,745
She was feeling shy to talk to you
so was talking to me.

1982
02:04:43,953 --> 02:04:46,251
Your love is success.
Yes boss!

1983
02:04:51,194 --> 02:04:55,597
What l couldn't achieve in 3 years,
you've done it, Madhav.

1984
02:04:55,798 --> 02:04:58,961
You're my brother!
My heir!

1985
02:05:02,071 --> 02:05:03,936
l love you!

1986
02:05:35,756 --> 02:05:37,383
Drowned his head into water,
no use, boss.

1987
02:05:37,591 --> 02:05:39,388
Plucked out his nails
with cutting plier, no use.

1988
02:05:39,593 --> 02:05:41,720
Used electric shock
and welding rods, no use.

1989
02:05:42,095 --> 02:05:45,064
He's refusing to forget her
and disobeying us, boss.

1990
02:05:45,332 --> 02:05:47,061
Why didn't you hang him upside down?

1991
02:05:47,267 --> 02:05:49,565
l did but he's sleeping.

1992
02:05:50,671 --> 02:05:53,162
Open it, let me see his face.

1993
02:05:58,779 --> 02:05:59,837
Bloody crap!

1994
02:06:00,113 --> 02:06:02,741
- Boss! Rat in the bag is missing.
- Missing?

1995
02:06:02,949 --> 02:06:05,076
Where's the rat?

1996
02:06:05,285 --> 02:06:08,413
l eat the rat for the parrot.

1997
02:06:08,622 --> 02:06:10,249
Hey old man! Do you need all this?

1998
02:06:10,957 --> 02:06:14,415
Buddy, not age only
heart matters in love.

1999
02:06:14,795 --> 02:06:16,763
Whichever side l see,
you look the same,

2000
02:06:16,963 --> 02:06:18,260
are you loving her from one side?

2001
02:06:19,032 --> 02:06:23,765
My love may be one side,
but Madhu is always my side only.

2002
02:06:23,970 --> 02:06:26,336
Boss, he's countering us
with repartee.

Hit me anywhere on my body but
please don't hit my heart.

2005
02:06:41,553 --> 02:06:42,019
Why?

2006
02:06:42,220 --> 02:06:46,680
Because Madhu resides
in my heart.

2007
02:06:47,058 --> 02:06:49,424
lf you hit me here,
she'll feel the pain there.

2008
02:06:50,328 --> 02:06:52,353
Hit on his head!

2009
02:06:56,401 --> 02:06:58,665
Throw him on road.

2010
02:07:21,226 --> 02:07:22,022
Hello!

2011
02:07:44,315 --> 02:07:46,545
Why are you shocked, Madhav?
Come in.

2012
02:07:47,418 --> 02:07:48,976
Madhu has accepted my love, right?

2013
02:07:49,320 --> 02:07:50,719
So l wanted to fix the marriage.

2014
02:07:52,323 --> 02:07:55,383
Brother Madhav...
he's everything to me.

2015
02:07:55,827 --> 02:07:57,795
He's the man responsible
for this happy moment.

2016
02:07:58,763 --> 02:08:01,061
Come...come in....come.

2017
02:08:03,768 --> 02:08:05,998
lt's happy moment!
Why are you all silent?

2018
02:08:06,271 --> 02:08:08,330
We can exchange the proposal before
inauspicious time sets in.

2019
02:08:10,108 --> 02:08:16,240
Madhu, May 21 , 28, June 18 are
auspicious days according to astrologer,

2020
02:08:16,814 --> 02:08:18,076

02:08:24,622 --> 02:08:27,250
That is...June 18 is okay to me.

2023
02:08:31,129 --> 02:08:33,427
June 18? l too thought of
the same date.

2024
02:08:33,798 --> 02:08:38,167
18...1+8 is 9,
that's my lucky number.

2025
02:08:39,537 --> 02:08:42,597
Boss, you've arranged so much,
why didn't you bring a photographer?

2026
02:08:42,807 --> 02:08:44,104
What the hell are you guys doing?

2027
02:08:44,475 --> 02:08:45,772
- Bloody fools...
- Did you get that idea?

2028
02:08:45,977 --> 02:08:47,842
l'll manage.
Sister-in-law is very beautiful.

2029
02:08:48,146 --> 02:08:52,378
Brother is feeling shy.
What a great couple! Smile please!

2030
02:08:52,750 --> 02:08:54,274
Don't worry, l'll manage.

2031

Uncle, please exchange the proposal.

2032
02:09:00,825 --> 02:09:01,291
Father-in-law!

2033
02:09:02,660 --> 02:09:03,627
Boss, smile please.

2034
02:09:03,995 --> 02:09:06,122
- Clap loudly!
- Let him do it, fool!

How can l sleep if l get dreams of
cutting, burning and gunning down?

2037
02:09:28,019 --> 02:09:29,077
My ill fate!

2038
02:09:29,220 --> 02:09:31,916
l must get out of this hell first.

2039
02:09:32,790 --> 02:09:34,155
This is the right time.

2040
02:09:34,692 --> 02:09:38,753
lf l start now, before day breaks
l can cross Tirupathi.

2041
02:09:39,197 --> 02:09:43,327
No problem of language,
l can live like a dumb.

2042
02:09:44,202 --> 02:09:45,567
Sleep without disturbing me.

2043
02:09:45,770 --> 02:09:49,501
Buffalo! He's living with iron cot
thinking about some woman.

2044
02:09:51,042 --> 02:09:52,339
He's having a cell phone.

2045
02:09:52,810 --> 02:09:55,506
Why should l leave it? Okay.

2046
02:09:56,047 --> 02:09:57,344
Next is watch.

2047
02:09:58,983 --> 02:10:02,510
lf l sell it, it'll help my journey.

2048
02:10:03,454 --> 02:10:05,684
Bag and money purse!

2049
02:10:08,893 --> 02:10:10,019
Knife!

2050
02:10:10,495 --> 02:10:11,359
Let it be!

2051
02:10:11,562 --> 02:10:13,257
lt'll be useful for defense.

2052
02:10:21,973 --> 02:10:26,808
He's standing still!
ls he sleeping or awake?

2053
02:10:27,245 --> 02:10:29,770
How am l to find it?

2054
02:10:35,620 --> 02:10:37,144
He's sleeping! Right!

2055
02:10:38,923 --> 02:10:40,720
Thank God!

2056
02:10:41,192 --> 02:10:43,820
How sincerely they are working!

2057
02:10:44,028 --> 02:10:46,223
He has taken training to sleep
in standing position.

2058
02:10:48,766 --> 02:10:50,233
Another cell phone here!

2059
02:10:51,602 --> 02:10:52,899
Oh no, it's ringing!

2060
02:10:54,105 --> 02:10:55,572
Hello...

2061
02:10:56,607 --> 02:10:58,575
Why did he drop it?

2062
02:11:01,612 --> 02:11:03,580
Oh God! elephant..pot...cat!

2063
02:11:04,449 --> 02:11:06,747
Fear is making my tongue slip!

2064
02:11:06,951 --> 02:11:09,078
What a nasty life!

2065
02:11:14,959 --> 02:11:16,756
What's that? Bell?

2066
02:11:16,961 --> 02:11:19,327
l pressed it myself.

2067
02:11:20,298 --> 02:11:23,426
How to get down?

2068
02:11:25,570 --> 02:11:29,597
Oh! Escaped from them!

2069
02:11:31,709 --> 02:11:35,270
Two bikes are coming.
l'll stop both of them.

2070
02:11:35,913 --> 02:11:39,280
One who stops,
l must get on it and escape.

2071
02:11:40,585 --> 02:11:43,452
Both bikes are travelling at same speed.

2072
02:11:45,490 --> 02:11:47,958
Oh! lt's a car!

2073
02:11:50,762 --> 02:11:53,458
- Who is it?
- Police!

2074
02:11:54,665 --> 02:11:56,132
Police?

2075
02:11:56,701 --> 02:11:57,395
Come here.

2076
02:11:58,669 --> 02:11:59,294
Coming sir.

2077
02:11:59,504 --> 02:12:02,234
Same police who thrashed me,
greetings sir.

2078
02:12:02,707 --> 02:12:04,140
Why did you jump the wall
at midnight?

2079
02:12:04,342 --> 02:12:07,311
No, l was just trying to see
if l can jump wall or not, sir.

2080
02:12:08,179 --> 02:12:10,477
- ls it Everest to try climbing it?
- No.

2081
02:12:10,681 --> 02:12:12,808
- Head constable, check his bag.
- Give me.

2082
02:12:13,184 --> 02:12:15,652
- Sir, he's carrying a knife too!
- Knife?

2083
02:12:16,354 --> 02:12:17,412
Don't shout!

2084
02:12:17,955 --> 02:12:21,982
l knew then itself when you
let a thief escape,

2085
02:12:22,193 --> 02:12:24,491
- that you're also a thief.
- Thief?

2086
02:12:24,695 --> 02:12:29,325
l let you off that day,
l'll not spare you today.

2087
02:12:29,534 --> 02:12:31,161
- No...no...
- Charge!

2088
02:12:31,369 --> 02:12:35,931
Why are you hitting me here also?

2089
02:12:39,710 --> 02:12:41,007
Madhu, it's paining!

2090
02:12:41,212 --> 02:12:44,340
l said l love you to you, why did you
tell Sivamani it was for him?

2091
02:12:44,715 --> 02:12:47,275
Now he has fixed the marriage too.
What are you going to do?

2092
02:12:48,886 --> 02:12:50,251
This marriage will definitely happen.

2093
02:12:50,555 --> 02:12:52,523
Sivamani will not be the groom,
l'll be the groom.

2094
02:12:52,723 --> 02:12:56,181
- How will it happen?
- Mrs.Madhav, Sivamani is an idiot,

2095
02:12:56,661 --> 02:12:59,687
if l give him sand and say
it's sugar, he'll eat it happily,

2096
02:13:00,498 --> 02:13:02,796
if l give poison and say
it's honey, he'll have it,

2097
02:13:03,234 --> 02:13:07,534
if l bring and elephant and ask him,
how is this monkey?

2098
02:13:07,738 --> 02:13:08,636
He'll say it's super!

2099
02:13:09,240 --> 02:13:10,798
l've fine tuned him like that.

2100
02:13:11,409 --> 02:13:12,535
Remote is in my hands.

2101
02:13:12,743 --> 02:13:14,142
l don't know how you do it,

2102
02:13:14,645 --> 02:13:19,810
l'll not be like others to love you
and marry him as fate's dictate,

2103
02:13:20,685 --> 02:13:22,744
l'll kill you and commit suicide.

2104
02:13:22,954 --> 02:13:24,216
Why are you tensed, Madhu?

2105
02:13:24,422 --> 02:13:26,720
l've already hit 99 runs,
can't l hitjust another run?

2106
02:13:27,492 --> 02:13:29,392
We'll hit a century
and live happily.

2107
02:13:29,594 --> 02:13:31,562
Why is your face dull?
Be happy.

2108
02:13:31,762 --> 02:13:34,993
- l'm scared.
- You said it and l didn't.

2109
02:13:35,266 --> 02:13:35,891
Let's see!

2110
02:13:36,100 --> 02:13:41,732
Boss is getting married, l'm happy!
Boss is getting married...

2111
02:13:42,940 --> 02:13:45,408
What's this boss?
Groom must be happy and jovial!

2112
02:13:45,776 --> 02:13:47,744
Look, how active l am!

2113
02:13:49,280 --> 02:13:50,406
l've talked to sister-in-law.

2114
02:13:50,615 --> 02:13:54,745
She was fighting why marriage
is fixed on June 18th.

2115
02:13:55,286 --> 02:13:57,083
She very eager to live with you.

2116
02:13:57,388 --> 02:13:58,514
One more thing, boss...

2117
02:13:58,856 --> 02:14:00,756
lt seems you must be clean shaven
while tying the knot.

2118
02:14:01,192 --> 02:14:02,591
This is sister-in-law's request.

2119
02:14:04,028 --> 02:14:05,256
You needn't if you don't like it.

2120
02:14:06,364 --> 02:14:11,529
Look, marriage happiness
is shining on your face. lsn't it?

2121
02:14:11,903 --> 02:14:13,598
Why is hanging his head down?
Jealousy!

2122
02:14:17,542 --> 02:14:21,774
l'm talking so much,
why is every one standing silently?

2123
02:14:26,751 --> 02:14:29,777
- Mrs.Madhav, Sivamani is an idiot,
- lt's Jiiva!

2124
02:14:30,254 --> 02:14:33,189
if l give him sand and say
it's sugar, he'll eat it happily,

2125
02:14:33,925 --> 02:14:36,291
if l give poison and say
it's honey, he'll have it,

2126
02:14:36,594 --> 02:14:40,462
if l bring and elephant and ask him,
how is this monkey?

2127
02:14:40,665 --> 02:14:44,123
That side it's sister-in-law...
this side...is it me?

2128
02:14:44,835 --> 02:14:45,961
What's this awful?

2129
02:14:46,170 --> 02:14:49,469
l heard about 7 look alikes
in this world,

2130
02:14:50,274 --> 02:14:51,468
will there be 7 shirts too?

2131
02:14:52,276 --> 02:14:55,302
Boss, this is graphics work.
Don't believe it.

2132
02:14:55,680 --> 02:14:58,308
That's not me,
l swear on you, boss.

2133
02:14:58,516 --> 02:14:59,244
Fraud!

2134
02:14:59,817 --> 02:15:10,785
<font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=DARKORANGE size=40> Z!@ <font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=BLUE size=40> ~  <font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=GREEN size=40> Am@n

2135
02:15:11,696 --> 02:15:14,665
Has Varadhan made a come back?
Then, it's climax!

2136
02:15:19,770 --> 02:15:23,171
- What shall we do now, Sivamani?
- Hey, he's boss!

2137
02:15:23,374 --> 02:15:25,069
l never considered him
as my boss.

2138
02:15:28,879 --> 02:15:30,176
For the anger on me...

2139
02:15:32,450 --> 02:15:35,010
For the anger on me,
you'll gun me down.

2140
02:15:36,053 --> 02:15:39,022
But you can never find Madhu
in your life.

2141
02:15:40,224 --> 02:15:41,350
What are you going to do?

2142
02:15:43,394 --> 02:15:45,419
Where is Madhu?

2143
02:15:46,063 --> 02:15:46,529
One second!

2144
02:15:47,665 --> 02:15:50,532
Go to hell! lf l tell you the place,
you'll go there.

2145
02:15:50,735 --> 02:15:53,101
- What about me then?
- What do you want?

2146
02:15:53,571 --> 02:15:58,873
Money...car...this house!
What do you want? Make a wish!

2147
02:15:59,076 --> 02:16:01,374
- Madhu!
- Brother's wife is sister-in-law to you.

2148
02:16:02,146 --> 02:16:03,545
Then, is younger brother's wife nothing?

2149
02:16:03,748 --> 02:16:05,113
Keep quiet, Sivamani.

2150
02:16:05,783 --> 02:16:07,478
You don't know about me.

2151
02:16:07,918 --> 02:16:09,385
l picked up weapon at the age of 5,

2152
02:16:09,587 --> 02:16:12,385
first murder at 10,
spent 8 years in jail,

2153
02:16:12,990 --> 02:16:17,154
became a don of Raipur at 22,
tell him boys!

2154
02:16:17,361 --> 02:16:21,661
My father has heard many such stories
and few films were box office hits.

2155
02:16:22,933 --> 02:16:24,161
May l tell you something,

2156
02:16:24,702 --> 02:16:27,569
never touch the girl who doesn't like you,
never give up the girl you love,

2157
02:16:29,373 --> 02:16:32,137
courage is not in men and weapons,

2158
02:16:32,343 --> 02:16:34,675
it's in the milk one had
from their mother.

2159
02:16:35,212 --> 02:16:38,409
What did you say? First murder at 10
and spent 8 years in jail,

2160
02:16:38,949 --> 02:16:42,248
Say l studied in a good college for 5 years,
joined a good company,

2161
02:16:42,453 --> 02:16:43,852
that's good for a good citizen,

2162
02:16:44,722 --> 02:16:47,156
why are you saying you took
to weapons and killed people?

2163
02:16:47,358 --> 02:16:48,757
You accept you're a goon,

2164
02:16:49,026 --> 02:16:50,755
how can Madhu accept you as husband?

2165
02:16:52,063 --> 02:16:53,928
What? What happened?

2166
02:16:54,899 --> 02:16:55,593
What?

2167
02:16:56,067 --> 02:16:57,261
Got information about
Madhu's whereabouts.

2168
02:16:57,968 --> 02:16:59,367
Okay, leave it.
l'll take care of it.

2169
02:17:07,545 --> 02:17:08,375
Boss...

2170
02:17:09,547 --> 02:17:11,378
l never accepted you as my man.

2171
02:17:12,717 --> 02:17:14,048
Don't harm Madhu.

2172
02:17:16,987 --> 02:17:17,612
What did you say?

2173
02:17:18,422 --> 02:17:20,720
l'm Bill Gates and you're a beggar.

2174
02:17:21,492 --> 02:17:24,518
l'm great! You're waste.

2175
02:17:25,029 --> 02:17:28,226
l'm big Anaconda in forest,
you're just an earth worm.

2176
02:17:28,766 --> 02:17:33,635
These were not my words.
lt was yours.

2177
02:17:35,072 --> 02:17:38,803
You came here for livelihood.
l was born here.

2178
02:17:39,343 --> 02:17:42,801
l may kill you, go away.
- No boss...- Go away!

2179
02:18:17,014 --> 02:18:18,106
l would also felt the same, right?

2180
02:18:18,315 --> 02:18:19,646
How long should l wait here?

2181
02:18:20,918 --> 02:18:21,885
You're safe, right?

2182
02:18:22,086 --> 02:18:23,883
l'm fine.
What happened to you?

2183
02:18:24,522 --> 02:18:25,454
Okay, come let's go.

2184
02:18:37,101 --> 02:18:39,399
This is known as let the rat
escape to find the hole.

2185
02:18:40,437 --> 02:18:42,337
Boss...then that phone call?

2186
02:18:42,540 --> 02:18:44,007
That was just an act.

2187
02:18:47,778 --> 02:18:48,802
What Madhav!

2188
02:18:50,281 --> 02:18:54,411
How dare you hide my Madhu
in my own den!

2189
02:18:54,785 --> 02:18:55,581
You...

2190
02:19:18,142 --> 02:19:24,103
You called me boss, putting arm around
my shoulder dared to loot me!

2191
02:19:25,307 --> 02:19:25,932
Leave me!

2192
02:19:31,313 --> 02:19:33,611
lf you hit him again,
l'll kill myself.

2193
02:19:37,319 --> 02:19:38,616
l'll hit you!

2194
02:19:39,154 --> 02:19:40,280
l'll die!

2195
02:19:40,990 --> 02:19:43,185
l'm in love with you for 3 years.

2196
02:19:44,360 --> 02:19:45,554
He came recently.

2197
02:19:46,495 --> 02:19:47,860
Only if he's alive, right?

2198
02:19:49,498 --> 02:19:52,626
Leave him!
Don't hit him!

2199
02:19:57,172 --> 02:19:58,639
<i>Please leave him...</i>

2200
02:20:01,176 --> 02:20:02,302
<i>Don't hit him!</i>

2201
02:20:05,347 --> 02:20:09,647
You promised to unite her with me
and cheated me.

2202
02:20:09,852 --> 02:20:11,319
Wastrel!

2203
02:20:11,921 --> 02:20:42,948
<font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=DARKORANGE size=40> Z!@ <font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=BLUE size=40> ~  <font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=GREEN size=40> Am@n

2204
02:20:43,652 --> 02:20:48,351
Leave him...please...
l'll marry you.

2205
02:20:55,731 --> 02:20:57,028
You said the same that day too.

2206
02:20:57,232 --> 02:21:00,360
l lied then, l'll really marry you.

2207
02:21:01,904 --> 02:21:02,871
Promise?

2208
02:21:03,072 --> 02:21:03,868
Promise.

2209
02:21:04,073 --> 02:21:04,869
With all your heart?

2210
02:21:05,240 --> 02:21:06,366
With all my heart!

2211
02:21:07,242 --> 02:21:08,800
- Not forcibly, right?
- No.

2212
02:21:09,011 --> 02:21:10,535
You're not saying it
to save his life, right?

2213
02:21:10,746 --> 02:21:12,043
No...no...no...

2214
02:21:14,083 --> 02:21:15,482
l promise l'll marry you.

2215
02:21:20,856 --> 02:21:23,950
l was waiting for 3 years to hear
this from you, Madhu.

2216
02:21:24,927 --> 02:21:26,121
Come...come...

2217
02:21:26,795 --> 02:21:29,923
He may die, Take him to the Hospital.

2218
02:22:32,730 --> 02:22:37,690
You hit me, l took it,
because it was my fault.

2219
02:22:39,470 --> 02:22:43,031
But if anyone of your hired goon
touches me...

2220
02:22:53,418 --> 02:22:56,216
One who forces the girl
who doesn't like him,

2221
02:22:56,421 --> 02:22:59,219
and one who leaves the girl
he likes isn't a man at all,

2222
02:23:15,873 --> 02:23:20,333
When l can hit so many men,
can't l hit you and take my girl?

2223
02:23:20,611 --> 02:23:23,580
Why don't you understand this?

2224
02:23:26,851 --> 02:23:29,513
These men are not with
because of affection,

2225
02:23:30,121 --> 02:23:33,090
half of them are waiting for an
opportunity to kill & take your place,

2226
02:23:33,291 --> 02:23:37,091
and others are with you
fearing death outside.

2227
02:23:42,532 --> 02:23:45,660
Just a while ago she promised
to marry you,

2228
02:23:46,370 --> 02:23:50,670
not for the love on you,
it's the love she has for me,

2229
02:23:51,875 --> 02:23:55,174
tell her to say it now,
l'll leave this place immediately.

2230
02:23:56,113 --> 02:23:57,603
Why don't you understand this?

2231
02:24:06,023 --> 02:24:08,992
Even in your dreams
you'll see your enemies only,

2232
02:24:09,359 --> 02:24:10,553
but she'll not come,

2233
02:24:12,259 --> 02:24:13,988
one who never comes
in your dreams too,

2234
02:24:14,427 --> 02:24:16,224
how can she spend her life with you?

2235
02:24:17,864 --> 02:24:22,927
Not 3 years, even after 30 years
you can't get her love.

2236
02:24:23,136 --> 02:24:26,936
Because she loves me.
She loves me.

2237
02:24:27,474 --> 02:24:32,002
What you did is torture!
What l do is love.

2238
02:24:34,915 --> 02:24:38,715
Love makes Mother Teresa so great!

2239
02:25:07,599 --> 02:25:11,296
l know you're a powerful man,
l'm an ordinary man,

2240
02:25:11,770 --> 02:25:14,295
that's why l wanted to be with you
and reform you,

2241
02:25:14,706 --> 02:25:15,900
is it wrong?

2242
02:25:20,945 --> 02:25:24,403
l always give away whatever l have.

2243
02:25:26,551 --> 02:25:28,849
First time in my life,
l'm asking you something,

2244
02:25:32,957 --> 02:25:34,584
return my Madhu to me.

2245
02:25:40,298 --> 02:25:44,200
lf you still wish to kill me
and live with her,

2246
02:25:44,402 --> 02:25:50,864
then l've no choice but to move this
mountain Sivamani with a hair Madhav.

2247
02:26:19,671 --> 02:26:23,801
You love me for 3 years,
but l never had such feeling for you.

2248
02:26:24,509 --> 02:26:25,635
<i>l will never get it.</i>

2249
02:26:26,444 --> 02:27:09,486
<font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=DARKORANGE size=40> Z!@ <font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=BLUE size=40> ~  <font face="Z!@ ~ Am@n" color=GREEN size=40> Am@n

2250
02:27:11,656 --> 02:27:15,456
Marry her, have children,
live happily,

2251
02:27:15,894 --> 02:27:21,628
if you dare to come here again to visit
mausoleums of Anna and MGR,

2252
02:27:22,967 --> 02:27:23,695
l'll kill you.

2253
02:27:23,902 --> 02:27:25,369
You too don't come to my place.

2254
02:27:26,237 --> 02:27:31,038
Native place, lot of friends,
they'll lynch you. lsn't it?

2255
02:27:37,982 --> 02:27:39,882
Go away! go!
