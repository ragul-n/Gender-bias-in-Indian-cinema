00:01:08,282 --> 00:01:11,672
MARCH 6, 1995, 6:30 AM.

2
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:15,985
Please give me a brother, God.

3
00:01:16,065 --> 00:01:16,988
Mr. Prakash!

4
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,703
It's a boy.

5
00:01:18,783 --> 00:01:23,408
'March 6, 1995.
I was born at 7:29 am.'

6
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:30,550
'March 15, 1995.
It was the day I came home.'

7
00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:33,504
'It wasn't a festival day'

8
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,039
'but there was a
celebration at home.'

9
00:01:36,741 --> 00:01:38,208
'Maybe it was meant for me.'

10
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:40,803
'But I didn't understand why
they gave me so much importance.'

11
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:44,449
'I really didn't get it
until I was six months old.'

12
00:01:44,995 --> 00:01:47,776
'Then one day I saw
myself in the mirror.'

13
00:01:48,178 --> 00:01:49,726
'I was small.'

14
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,200
'I was cute.'

15
00:01:52,684 --> 00:01:56,706
'Then I understood that they all give
me importance because I'm a baby.'

16
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:59,063
'My smile brought
happiness to everyone.'

17
00:02:00,225 --> 00:02:02,183
'My tears made my dad very tense.'

18
00:02:02,426 --> 00:02:04,654
'And the first time I stood
up was a big achievement.'

19
00:02:05,242 --> 00:02:07,083
Mom! Brother stood up.

20
00:02:07,163 --> 00:02:10,050
'Every occasion connected
to me was a grand celebration.'

21
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,116
Arjun.

22
00:02:13,536 --> 00:02:15,453
Make a wish, my boy. Make a wish.

23
00:02:16,373 --> 00:02:20,587
'Mom said that God grants
us our wishes on our birthday.'

24
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:22,382
MARCH 6, 1999.

25
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:24,569
'All the elderly
ones shower love on me.'

26
00:02:24,649 --> 00:02:25,461
THAT SAME EVENING.

27
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,520
'But there was nobody of my age.'

28
00:02:27,924 --> 00:02:33,363
'I wish God gives me a friend,
no, a girlfriend to play with.'

29
00:02:38,712 --> 00:02:40,026
Anu! Get down.

30
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,631
I'm Prakash. We are your neighbors.

31
00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:09,257
She's my wife.

32
00:03:09,337 --> 00:03:10,448
Hello.
- Hello.

33
00:03:10,528 --> 00:03:12,495
Mom!
- Come, darling.

34
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:15,200
My daughter Anu. I'm Shailaja.
- Oh! So cute.

35
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,334
She's my daughter Sharada.

36
00:03:16,414 --> 00:03:17,462
Hi.
- Hi, aunt.

37
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:18,894
Arjun, come here.

38
00:03:19,143 --> 00:03:20,299
Say hello.

39
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:23,661
Hi.
- Hi.

40
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:26,124
Friends?

41
00:03:26,795 --> 00:03:28,068
Friends.

42
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,853
What's your name?
- I'm Anu.

43
00:03:31,998 --> 00:03:33,991
Why are you carrying the things?
- It's okay. Take this.

44
00:03:34,071 --> 00:03:35,444
Thank you.
- I'm from Bangalore.

45
00:03:35,524 --> 00:03:37,237
Where is your father?

46
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,841
He collided with the
divider and died on the spot.

47
00:03:42,073 --> 00:03:43,761
My girl was just two years old.

48
00:03:50,881 --> 00:03:51,788
For me?

49
00:03:52,035 --> 00:03:55,036
Arjun! Give the chocolate to her.

50
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,120
Give it to her.

51
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,974
'That was the first
time my dad shouted at me.'

52
00:04:00,054 --> 00:04:04,991
Thank you. - 'What Anu did next
made her a superstar in their eyes.'

53
00:04:06,954 --> 00:04:08,356
Wow, Anu!

54
00:04:08,511 --> 00:04:10,864
Dad! Did you see what Anu did?

55
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:13,164
She shared the chocolate with Arjun.

56
00:04:13,244 --> 00:04:14,738
Anu, you are so cute.

57
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:16,503
Where did you learn
such good manners, dear?

58
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,155
Where did you learn them, darling?

59
00:04:18,328 --> 00:04:21,943
"O Rama,
please engage me in your service"

60
00:04:22,023 --> 00:04:23,275
'Just as Amitabh Bachchan's entry'

61
00:04:23,355 --> 00:04:25,187
'shook up Rajesh Khanna's stardom'

62
00:04:25,454 --> 00:04:28,698
'I understood that Anu's
arrival ended my star status.'

63
00:04:28,778 --> 00:04:30,765
'So, I became jealous of her.'

64
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,030
'Shailaja aunt, Anu's mom'

65
00:04:34,744 --> 00:04:36,862
'became my only supporter
in the whole colony.'

66
00:04:37,717 --> 00:04:39,793
'She was the most important
one to me after my parents.'

67
00:04:40,463 --> 00:04:42,755
'Sometimes I liked
her more than my parents.'

68
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:47,442
'June 12, 2001.
It was a very important day for me.'

69
00:04:47,522 --> 00:04:50,486
'I was in first standard.
I'm a complete man.'

70
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:55,176
Don't cry, dear. Look at Arjun.
He's smiling like a good boy.

71
00:04:55,397 --> 00:04:56,712
What will you take
to go to the class?

72
00:04:56,926 --> 00:05:00,109
I'll go if Arjun comes to my class.

73
00:05:02,397 --> 00:05:05,104
Arjun! Are you going to
study kindergarten once again?

74
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:08,468
'Then my jealousy
turned into hatred.'

75
00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:11,340
'I hated being in
the same class again

76
00:05:11,573 --> 00:05:13,380
and I started failing
in my subjects.

77
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:17,264
A for apple, B for bapple,
C for capple, D for dapple?

78
00:05:17,635 --> 00:05:19,382
What's this?
How will you do well in your exams?

79
00:05:19,462 --> 00:05:21,388
Hi, uncle.
- Hello.

80
00:05:21,468 --> 00:05:23,965
I came first in class.

81
00:05:24,121 --> 00:05:26,162
Look at her. Learn from Anu.

82
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:29,916
'I was scared that I'll continue
to hear that in the future too.'

83
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,258
ARJUN JUMPING THE
SCHOOL GATE AT THE AGE OF TEN

84
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:33,997
Uncle! Arjun bunked school today.

85
00:05:34,077 --> 00:05:35,323
Don't you have any sense?

86
00:05:36,351 --> 00:05:38,488
'She tattled on me
and then she comforted me.'

87
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,754
I have your best interests at heart.

88
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,187
ARJUN AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN

89
00:05:47,631 --> 00:05:48,980
Uncle, Arjun...

90
00:05:49,136 --> 00:05:50,736
How will you progress in life?

91
00:05:52,363 --> 00:05:53,617
Sorry, Arjun.

92
00:05:55,692 --> 00:05:56,653
What's this?
What will you do with this?

93
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:58,393
'My classes went up
but my scores went down.'

94
00:05:58,762 --> 00:05:59,877
Learn from Anu.

95
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:02,538
'She scored the top rank in EAMCET'

96
00:06:02,618 --> 00:06:04,751
'but my rank sounded
like Delhi's zip code.'

97
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:06,302
'We had to pawn mom's
gold jewelry to pay'

98
00:06:06,382 --> 00:06:07,672
'for a seat in the
engineering college.'

99
00:06:08,273 --> 00:06:09,304
Learn from Anu.

100
00:06:09,664 --> 00:06:11,636
'Learn from Anu.'

101
00:06:11,716 --> 00:06:12,536
AFTER A FEW YEARS

102
00:06:12,616 --> 00:06:14,335
'I somehow managed
to finish four years.'

103
00:06:14,701 --> 00:06:16,618
'We are expecting final
year's results today.'

104
00:06:34,873 --> 00:06:35,937
Yes!

105
00:06:37,502 --> 00:06:38,600
What? Did you pass?

106
00:06:38,972 --> 00:06:40,572
Of course! I scored 95% marks!

107
00:06:40,652 --> 00:06:41,808
Congrats!

108
00:06:41,888 --> 00:06:43,192
Thank you.

109
00:06:45,215 --> 00:06:46,565
What are you doing?

110
00:06:46,885 --> 00:06:48,649
Seeing Arjun's result.

111
00:06:52,299 --> 00:06:53,579
'What's wrong?'

112
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,277
He failed in five subjects.
Poor guy.

113
00:06:57,331 --> 00:06:59,052
He'll be so upset when he sees it.

114
00:06:59,797 --> 00:07:00,895
I wonder where he is now.

115
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:30,915
Hi, Arjun!
I heard you failed in five subjects.

116
00:07:32,446 --> 00:07:33,657
Who told you?

117
00:07:33,864 --> 00:07:36,173
Anu told me. She's very sad.

118
00:07:37,037 --> 00:07:39,251
Me too. I'm planning
to study all these books

119
00:07:39,331 --> 00:07:41,674
and pass in supplementary exams.

120
00:07:41,942 --> 00:07:44,202
Really? Come with me.

121
00:07:47,392 --> 00:07:48,854
What happened to the
books in these shelves?

122
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:50,489
That's exactly what I want to know.

123
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:52,218
What happened to all these books?
- Sir?

124
00:07:52,298 --> 00:07:54,163
Ever since you joined
in first year of college

125
00:07:54,243 --> 00:07:57,283
you've been taking
books for regular exams

126
00:07:57,363 --> 00:07:59,946
and supplementary exams,
but never return them.

127
00:08:00,026 --> 00:08:01,952
You even took the
telephone directory home.

128
00:08:02,186 --> 00:08:03,854
I think I'm going to lose my job.

129
00:08:04,248 --> 00:08:06,469
What did you do with those books?

130
00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:08,281
How many subjects did you fail?
- Five.

131
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:10,149
I failed in six subjects.
How many did you fail?

132
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:11,844
Five plus six, eleven.

133
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,691
You are the well-educated
guy in our group.

134
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,788
The cover is torn.
You'll get only 300 bucks for it.

135
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,588
Take them back.

136
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,262
No. Arjun, wait.
Why are you taking them back?

137
00:08:21,342 --> 00:08:22,944
What do you expect?

138
00:08:23,024 --> 00:08:24,411
Didn't we sell you 400
books in the last four years

139
00:08:24,491 --> 00:08:25,546
for reasonable prices?

140
00:08:25,626 --> 00:08:27,034
You've become too
money-minded, uncle.

141
00:08:27,114 --> 00:08:28,943
Please don't instigate him.

142
00:08:29,023 --> 00:08:31,240
Forget it.
Call the bookstore uncle in Koti.

143
00:08:31,482 --> 00:08:33,592
No, wait.
- Call him right now.

144
00:08:33,807 --> 00:08:35,938
Don't do that.
I'll pay you. Take your money.

145
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,734
You are regular customers.
- Give that to me.

146
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:40,358
Give it.

147
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:41,771
Get lost.

148
00:08:42,695 --> 00:08:43,534
Take this.

149
00:08:43,614 --> 00:08:45,601
We can party like rich guys now.

150
00:08:48,247 --> 00:08:49,957
Don't be sad that you failed.

151
00:08:50,037 --> 00:08:53,279
The sun will shine on you again.
I'm with you.

152
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:55,354
Her stupid sympathy.

153
00:08:55,847 --> 00:08:57,456
Don't vent your
anger on your iPhone.

154
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,531
Did you forget what all
we did to get you this phone?

155
00:08:59,732 --> 00:09:01,337
Apply for recounting
of your marks, man.

156
00:09:01,496 --> 00:09:03,036
I checked with a
man in the university.

157
00:09:03,116 --> 00:09:04,082
He'll take 5,000
rupees for a subject

158
00:09:04,162 --> 00:09:05,422
and give you the
scores that you want.

159
00:09:05,872 --> 00:09:08,544
But please tell Anu not to
tell your dad about it. He will...

160
00:09:08,624 --> 00:09:09,798
I'll hit you with my shoe!

161
00:09:09,878 --> 00:09:12,125
I paid for your bike,
I paid for the fuel in it

162
00:09:12,205 --> 00:09:14,123
I fed you well and
gave you pocket money.

163
00:09:14,203 --> 00:09:15,594
And these are the marks you score?

164
00:09:15,674 --> 00:09:18,465
All the marks put together
are less than your weight.

165
00:09:18,545 --> 00:09:19,436
Don't scold me, Dad.
Others are watching.

166
00:09:19,516 --> 00:09:22,259
Are you embarrassed? How
should I show my face in the office?

167
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:24,404
Look! Sridhar's son cleared IAS.

168
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:26,355
Pranith's daughter
got a seat in IIT.

169
00:09:26,435 --> 00:09:28,375
Learn from them, you idiot!

170
00:09:28,618 --> 00:09:30,473
How will you get good marks
if you have stupid friends?

171
00:09:30,553 --> 00:09:32,922
You just know to eat
mom's food and laze around.

172
00:09:33,002 --> 00:09:33,870
Let me go.

173
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,292
Go and sit at their feet.
Then you might learn something.

174
00:09:36,372 --> 00:09:37,660
Your stupid hair
and your silly glasses!

175
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,813
Calm down. Just calm down.

176
00:09:40,295 --> 00:09:41,199
What is your salary?

177
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,384
I earn one hundred thousand a month.

178
00:09:42,464 --> 00:09:43,616
Ambani earns ten million a month.

179
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:45,609
Why don't you go and learn from him?

180
00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:47,609
What nonsense!
What's that comparison?

181
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:48,930
Every man has his own limit.

182
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,783
Exactly. We have our own limits.

183
00:09:50,863 --> 00:09:52,873
So instead of pouncing
on us like a hound

184
00:09:52,953 --> 00:09:54,493
and asking us to learn from others

185
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:56,001
get to know our
limitations and support us.

186
00:09:56,081 --> 00:09:57,897
Or, be content with
what we know and leave us.

187
00:09:57,977 --> 00:10:00,844
We'll achieve something
by our own merit someday.

188
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:01,896
Got it?

189
00:10:02,864 --> 00:10:03,680
Get lost.

190
00:12:13,453 --> 00:12:16,030
I want to eat ice-cream, man.

191
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,951
You want ice-cream now?
Let's just go home.

192
00:12:18,031 --> 00:12:21,765
No. We shouldn't go
home with dissatisfaction.

193
00:12:22,015 --> 00:12:25,077
I'm already upset that I failed.
- Really?

194
00:12:25,258 --> 00:12:27,248
I'll make sure you
get your ice-cream.

195
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:30,049
Be careful.

196
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,989
Let's see.
Oh no, the bumper came loose.

197
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:39,030
Let's run, man.

198
00:12:40,103 --> 00:12:43,398
This car looks familiar to me.

199
00:12:45,377 --> 00:12:46,770
Arjun!

200
00:12:47,098 --> 00:12:49,606
I rammed into somebody's car.
- It's our car.

201
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,140
I told you it looked familiar.

202
00:12:52,323 --> 00:12:54,018
Aunt, please don't tell my dad.

203
00:12:54,098 --> 00:12:56,898
Shailu!
Shailu! What's the matter?

204
00:12:56,978 --> 00:12:58,117
Nothing.

205
00:12:58,197 --> 00:13:00,323
Who eats ice-cream at this hour?

206
00:13:00,403 --> 00:13:01,439
Just a small dent.

207
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,702
But you said something
about satisfaction.

208
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,653
Shut up!

209
00:13:05,374 --> 00:13:06,905
How did you collide into the car?

210
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,811
Actually...
Yanam wanted to eat ice-cream

211
00:13:09,891 --> 00:13:12,475
so I took a left turn and
just collided into your car.

212
00:13:12,742 --> 00:13:14,135
Just collided?
- Yes.

213
00:13:14,714 --> 00:13:17,418
What rubbish, you...
- Uncle, calm down.

214
00:13:17,498 --> 00:13:19,135
You idiot!
- Don't scare him.

215
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,837
I'll talk to him. Okay?

216
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:24,109
Arjun! This is not done.
You should be careful.

217
00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:26,238
What if there was a person
here instead of a car?

218
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:31,006
Arjun! Why are your eyes so red?

219
00:13:32,032 --> 00:13:33,178
Are you fine?

220
00:13:34,216 --> 00:13:36,119
Oops. She did it again.

221
00:13:40,108 --> 00:13:40,963
Come here.

222
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:42,193
Do you think he has conjunctivitis?

223
00:13:42,273 --> 00:13:43,217
Shut up.

224
00:13:44,435 --> 00:13:46,075
Don't do moonwalking. Walk fast.

225
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:48,987
Shut up.
- Exhale.

226
00:13:49,908 --> 00:13:52,890
Actually I just ate 'Biryani'.
I'll have bad breath.

227
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,056
I'll go to the bathroom,
wash my mouth and come back.

228
00:13:55,506 --> 00:13:57,478
Nothing doing. Just exhale.

229
00:14:01,995 --> 00:14:03,565
Baby...
- Stop it. He's there.

230
00:14:04,859 --> 00:14:07,917
I got a high just from your breath.
How much did you drink?

231
00:14:08,504 --> 00:14:10,469
How dare you drive under influence?

232
00:14:11,364 --> 00:14:13,276
You idiot!
- Uncle, let it be.

233
00:14:13,356 --> 00:14:15,049
Maybe he's upset about his results.

234
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:17,401
he forgot to tell her. He's dead.

235
00:14:19,477 --> 00:14:20,670
The results are out?

236
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:24,104
Yes, uncle. I scored 95%.

237
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:27,992
It's time to go.
Arjun, bye. See you later.

238
00:14:28,173 --> 00:14:29,550
Uncle! Aunt! Good night!

239
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,283
Hey, wait.
- Bye. I won't stay. I'm going.

240
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:33,756
What about you?

241
00:14:34,904 --> 00:14:36,067
Did you score 75%?

242
00:14:37,035 --> 00:14:38,219
At least 65%?

243
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:41,761
Is it 50%?

244
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,699
Did you at least pass?

245
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:45,020
Almost passed.

246
00:14:45,201 --> 00:14:47,090
What does that even mean?

247
00:14:47,235 --> 00:14:48,758
What does he mean, dear?

248
00:14:48,838 --> 00:14:50,578
I mean we have 40
subjects in engineering.

249
00:14:50,658 --> 00:14:52,820
So, I passed in 87.5% subjects.

250
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,657
Uncle, he failed in five subjects.

251
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:57,975
Just five, Dad.

252
00:14:58,301 --> 00:14:59,768
You failed in engineering?

253
00:15:00,349 --> 00:15:03,407
This middle class father
can't pay for his studies anymore.

254
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:05,130
Mom, didn't you say
we are upper middle class?

255
00:15:05,711 --> 00:15:06,528
Yeah.

256
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:09,447
Our family has fallen
into the middle class category

257
00:15:09,527 --> 00:15:10,623
because of paying
for your education.

258
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:12,554
By the time you get
a degree in engineering

259
00:15:12,634 --> 00:15:14,277
our family will be
sweeping the streets.

260
00:15:14,357 --> 00:15:16,782
Learn from Anu. Learn from her.

261
00:15:17,176 --> 00:15:18,581
You don't have to be a top ranker

262
00:15:18,661 --> 00:15:20,532
but you should at
least get passing marks.

263
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,435
I will definitely pass
if I apply for recounting.

264
00:15:22,515 --> 00:15:24,677
Really?
- But Arjun, you scores are so bad

265
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,735
that applying for recounting
will be a waste of money.

266
00:15:28,702 --> 00:15:29,768
Right, Mom?

267
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,185
I'll break your
head with this bumper!

268
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:32,521
Oh dear! Please calm down!

269
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:34,922
Don't stop me. Let me
hit this fellow at least once.

270
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:37,613
Brother! Brother! What are
you doing? People are watching us.

271
00:15:37,693 --> 00:15:38,838
Let's go home and discuss it.
- Okay.

272
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:40,194
Come on, Arjun.

273
00:15:40,436 --> 00:15:41,605
You idiot!
- Anu! Take uncle with you.

274
00:15:41,685 --> 00:15:43,454
Uncle! Come with me.
- Take him, dear.

275
00:15:43,534 --> 00:15:44,491
Come on, uncle.

276
00:15:46,124 --> 00:15:48,255
Will you really pass
if you apply for recounting?

277
00:15:48,335 --> 00:15:49,764
Definitely, aunt.
I okayed the deal.

278
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:51,687
Oh, it's a scam.
- Of course.

279
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:53,700
Come home tomorrow and take
money from me. Don't tell anyone.

280
00:15:53,949 --> 00:15:56,094
Especially Anu.
Okay? Get in.

281
00:15:56,786 --> 00:15:58,419
Wait. Sit in the back.

282
00:16:19,737 --> 00:16:21,066
Take it. Don't cast evil eyes on me.

283
00:16:30,181 --> 00:16:31,183
The flight landed. Let's go.

284
00:16:37,222 --> 00:16:39,185
Hi.
- Hi, sis. How are you?

285
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:40,491
I'm good, little brother.

286
00:16:40,571 --> 00:16:42,230
Hi, Anu.
- Where is the little one?

287
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,218
Uncle! Hi!

288
00:16:44,468 --> 00:16:46,535
Nephew!
- My favorite friend!

289
00:16:46,615 --> 00:16:48,170
My tsunami!
- My tidal wave!

290
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,600
My sharp arrow!
- One minute.

291
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,273
Bless me, uncle.

292
00:16:53,353 --> 00:16:56,334
It's all his training.
- May you be invincible!

293
00:16:56,637 --> 00:16:57,597
Let's go.

294
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:02,094
iPhone. - What did you
decide about what I said?

295
00:17:02,174 --> 00:17:04,187
I'm preparing for it.
- What is it?

296
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,643
I've been asking
Anu to write GMAT exams.

297
00:17:07,723 --> 00:17:10,187
We've the Turin School
Of Management where we live.

298
00:17:10,267 --> 00:17:11,700
It's the best college in the world.

299
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,148
She'll be set for life
if she gets a seat there.

300
00:17:14,228 --> 00:17:17,607
She doesn't need all that.
You ask Arjun to write it.

301
00:17:17,884 --> 00:17:19,388
I'll write it if Arjun writes it.

302
00:17:19,596 --> 00:17:22,173
No need. I will find a
good marriage proposal for you.

303
00:17:22,253 --> 00:17:23,682
Shut up and get married.

304
00:17:23,855 --> 00:17:26,028
Stop it.
Why do you always harass me?

305
00:17:29,952 --> 00:17:31,906
Chintu! Will you play
all day without studying?

306
00:17:31,986 --> 00:17:33,117
Uncle, handle her.

307
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:34,907
Oh, so you are behind this.

308
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:39,137
Chintu! Your uncle failed
in five subjects in engineering.

309
00:17:39,217 --> 00:17:41,679
You failed?

310
00:17:42,146 --> 00:17:45,242
Actually, I failed on purpose.

311
00:17:45,322 --> 00:17:46,608
Why like that?

312
00:17:47,075 --> 00:17:50,240
Actually... What did your dad study?

313
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,788
He studied MS in MIT.

314
00:17:51,868 --> 00:17:54,746
What is he doing now?
- He's working for Microsoft.

315
00:17:55,585 --> 00:17:56,927
Yes. But Bill Gates owns Microsoft.

316
00:17:57,007 --> 00:17:58,933
And do you know what he studied?

317
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,000
He failed in college just like me.

318
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,307
You rascal!
- Really?

319
00:18:02,473 --> 00:18:05,774
Yeah. So, you've to fail
if you want to be the boss.

320
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,761
And you've to study very
hard if you want be an employee.

321
00:18:07,841 --> 00:18:08,965
You choose.

322
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:13,173
Mom, I don't want to be an employee.
I won't study.

323
00:18:13,608 --> 00:18:14,833
Hey, wait.
- Correct.

324
00:18:14,913 --> 00:18:16,831
I'll pull your eyes out. You rascal!
- Sis! Sis!

325
00:18:16,911 --> 00:18:18,872
What's wrong?
- Aunt, please get out of my way.

326
00:18:18,952 --> 00:18:19,931
Aunt, save me.

327
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:21,515
I'll see how you'll escape me today.

328
00:18:21,595 --> 00:18:23,847
Stop. Stop right there.

329
00:18:24,283 --> 00:18:28,220
Stop. I said stop. Stop.

330
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,178
Anu, move aside.

331
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:34,034
You.

332
00:18:36,145 --> 00:18:38,584
You are spoiling my son.
I'll kill you. Stop.

333
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,802
Hey, kids!

334
00:18:43,271 --> 00:18:44,517
What's going on here?

335
00:18:44,742 --> 00:18:46,151
Dad, he... - Swear on Chintu's life,
don't say a word.

336
00:18:46,231 --> 00:18:47,085
Rascal.
- What?

337
00:18:47,165 --> 00:18:49,992
Nothing, dad.
I want Arjun to write GMAT exams

338
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:51,471
but he's not interested at all.

339
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:55,078
GMAT? Be realistic, my dear.

340
00:18:55,312 --> 00:18:58,157
He couldn't finish
engineering in four years.

341
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,098
Give your ideas to Anu.
She'll achieve them.

342
00:19:03,581 --> 00:19:04,645
Arjun!

343
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:07,032
Arjun!

344
00:19:08,468 --> 00:19:10,197
Arjun!

345
00:19:10,422 --> 00:19:12,714
Why are you so upset?
- The old man has gone crazy.

346
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,865
Will you tell him?

347
00:19:19,321 --> 00:19:22,213
He'll start off again.
- Arjun, GMAT exam is very easy.

348
00:19:22,448 --> 00:19:23,742
Just basic English and Math.

349
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,502
You just need to study two days.
I can help you.

350
00:19:31,864 --> 00:19:33,676
I didn't mind it
when my dad scolded me

351
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,704
but I literally wanted
to die when said she'll tutor me.

352
00:19:35,784 --> 00:19:37,566
Relax, man. It's a common feeling.

353
00:19:37,646 --> 00:19:41,088
I want to write GMAT exams
and get into Turina college.

354
00:19:41,254 --> 00:19:42,666
Do you know how to write GMAT exams?

355
00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:43,745
With a pen.

356
00:19:44,361 --> 00:19:46,748
What is he...
- Don't panic.

357
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:49,308
GMAT is a computerized exam.

358
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,377
You've to attempt it in a computer.

359
00:19:51,862 --> 00:19:52,927
Can I carry chits?

360
00:19:53,007 --> 00:19:54,145
Oh Lord!

361
00:19:55,321 --> 00:19:57,750
You had so many backlogs
in the final year

362
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,403
that we made a deal
with an invigilator

363
00:19:59,483 --> 00:20:00,974
and sent you to write
exams with a guidebook in hand

364
00:20:01,054 --> 00:20:03,147
but you still managed
to fail in five subjects.

365
00:20:03,227 --> 00:20:05,291
Do you know how hard it
is to find answers in a guidebook?

366
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,861
I know you've your reasons.
But this is...

367
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,608
Look! You are here. Your IQ is here.

368
00:20:11,688 --> 00:20:13,427
But GMAT is up there.
- Where?

369
00:20:13,766 --> 00:20:15,267
Don't search for it.
You won't be able to see it.

370
00:20:15,939 --> 00:20:17,496
You don't have that
level of intelligence.

371
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:18,976
Don't discourage him.

372
00:20:19,056 --> 00:20:21,315
There's a way to do
it but it's a bit risky.

373
00:20:21,395 --> 00:20:24,269
Don't give him stupid advice.
- Stop it. You tell me.

374
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:25,763
My brother-in-law has a consultancy.

375
00:20:25,843 --> 00:20:27,452
And he has the license
to conduct GMAT exams.

376
00:20:27,532 --> 00:20:29,153
He'll definitely help you.

Welcome to Sarvesh Foreign
Education Consultancy.

388
00:21:00,883 --> 00:21:02,819
My friends Arjun and Yanam.

389
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:05,206
Oh, Arjun. The candidate.

390
00:21:05,286 --> 00:21:06,426
Nice meeting you.
- Hi, sir.

391
00:21:06,506 --> 00:21:07,593
Come, please.

392
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:10,966
This is GRA department,
and that's GMAT department.

393
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:13,656
One of them,
I mean someone who looks like you

394
00:21:13,736 --> 00:21:14,935
will write the exam for you.

395
00:21:15,015 --> 00:21:17,738
Sir, I've a small doubt.
Won't he get caught

396
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,623
in online invigilation
through webcam?

397
00:21:19,703 --> 00:21:21,492
Silly boy.
When we see our Aadhar Card suddenly

398
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:22,745
we don't recognize our own faces.

399
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:25,790
How can a guy sitting
in call center recognize you?

400
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,059
And these webcams are from China.
They don't work.

401
00:21:29,846 --> 00:21:30,858
Sir!

402
00:21:31,273 --> 00:21:32,536
Hey, Sweetie!
- Your signature.

403
00:21:32,616 --> 00:21:37,759
Sir, she is?
- My PA. She does all my work.

404
00:21:37,924 --> 00:21:39,333
All your work?

405
00:21:39,514 --> 00:21:40,578
Naughty fellow.

406
00:21:41,223 --> 00:21:43,201
These are common these days.

407
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,314
The deal is okay for me.

408
00:21:45,394 --> 00:21:46,888
I'll call you once
I arrange the money. Okay?

409
00:21:47,726 --> 00:21:49,777
You are acting rashly, buddy.

410
00:21:49,857 --> 00:21:52,456
If something goes wrong you won't
be fit to study in Bangkok too.

411
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,763
I'm already drowning, man.
A little more water won't hurt.

412
00:21:54,843 --> 00:21:56,977
I want my dad to stop saying
that I should learn from Anu.

413
00:21:57,177 --> 00:21:58,766
So, I have to write GMAT.

414
00:21:58,846 --> 00:22:01,484
I mean I've to make someone
else write it for me. Period.

415
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,772
I don't want to write GMAT exam.
I think I'll drop it.

416
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:07,439
Are you mad? You've been
preparing for it for so long.

417
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:08,446
What happened to
you all of a sudden?

418
00:22:08,867 --> 00:22:11,048
My mom doesn't want me to write it.

419
00:22:11,191 --> 00:22:15,193
And I'll miss everyone
if I go aboard for studies.

420
00:22:15,698 --> 00:22:16,843
Really? What's the real reason?

421
00:22:18,122 --> 00:22:24,233
Arjun is not interested
in writing GMAT exam, so...

422
00:22:24,748 --> 00:22:25,622
So?

423
00:22:26,557 --> 00:22:29,048
He'll be all alone if I leave.
Poor guy.

424
00:22:30,196 --> 00:22:32,422
Sir, my friend is not well. That's
why we were riding triple seat.

425
00:22:32,502 --> 00:22:34,558
He looks fine.
- I can't bear it anymore.

426
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:37,948
She's been crushing me for the
past 20 years. I'm so frustrated.

427
00:22:38,372 --> 00:22:39,712
Anu is my first enemy.

428
00:22:39,911 --> 00:22:42,722
Arjun is my first friend.
My best friend.

429
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:46,614
He's been supporting me
in everything for 20 years now.

430
00:22:46,694 --> 00:22:48,370
No matter what I buy,
I've to share it with her.

431
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,563
That's my dad's rule.

432
00:22:49,823 --> 00:22:52,254
No matter what he buys,
he shares it with me first.

433
00:22:52,408 --> 00:22:53,628
That's his sentiment.

434
00:22:54,761 --> 00:22:56,327
She got me into trouble
with my dad so many times.

435
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,664
No matter how many times
I got him into trouble

436
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,619
he never got angry with me.

437
00:23:01,112 --> 00:23:03,335
I found a really good
family because of him.

438
00:23:04,606 --> 00:23:06,846
My family sees me
as a fool because of her.

439
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:10,142
I hate her from the
bottom of my heart.

440
00:23:10,843 --> 00:23:12,452
That's why I have to get rid of her.

441
00:23:12,532 --> 00:23:15,436
He's very close to my heart.
I can't live without him.

442
00:23:15,738 --> 00:23:18,445
Then marry him. Then he'll
be with you all your life.

443
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:19,431
Stop it.

444
00:23:19,511 --> 00:23:23,055
Anu, I feel you are giving
too much importance to Arjun.

445
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,745
What do you mean?
- You say he's your best friend.

446
00:23:25,825 --> 00:23:28,460
But he doesn't even
treat you like a friend.

447
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,263
Don't be silly.
- Don't be silly.

448
00:23:30,343 --> 00:23:34,423
You follow him around
but did he ever talk to you nicely?

449
00:23:34,777 --> 00:23:37,113
He's friendly with other girls,
but not with you.

450
00:23:37,658 --> 00:23:38,799
He flirts with them too.

451
00:23:39,734 --> 00:23:40,806
Just relax.

452
00:23:43,758 --> 00:23:47,055
Wow, it smells so good.

453
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:51,690
Wow...

454
00:23:53,846 --> 00:23:55,349
Who are you?
- Anu, stop.

455
00:23:55,429 --> 00:23:57,391
Don't you know how
to behave with a girl?

456
00:23:57,791 --> 00:24:00,700
I've been noticing you...
- How dare you insult our boss?

457
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,570
Who are you?
- How dare you!

458
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:05,803
Madam is upset that
I'm not testing it

459
00:24:05,883 --> 00:24:08,051
on a beautiful girl like her. Right?

460
00:24:15,145 --> 00:24:16,339
Give it to me.

461
00:24:16,858 --> 00:24:18,371
Leave a tip, man.
- Hello.

462
00:24:18,451 --> 00:24:21,121
Arjun! I'm at the flea market.
- What's up?

463
00:24:21,201 --> 00:24:23,708
Some guy is harassing me.
Come here right now.

464
00:24:24,478 --> 00:24:26,191
Fine, I'll reach in 15 minutes.

465
00:24:26,952 --> 00:24:28,846
You guys go take an auto.
- Where are you going?

466
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,740
Someone is harassing Anu.
I'll go deal with him.

467
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,409
Wait. You were abusing her till now

468
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:33,957
and now you want to go to help her?

469
00:24:34,037 --> 00:24:36,232
If I don't go to help her,
she'll call my dad next.

470
00:24:36,312 --> 00:24:38,576
My dad will call me
and hurl abuses at me.

471
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,606
Is that necessary?

472
00:24:40,963 --> 00:24:41,924
Okay, bye.

473
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:47,053
You provoked her with your words.

474
00:24:47,133 --> 00:24:48,699
And she picked a fight with him.

475
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:50,899
Arjun will come.

476
00:24:57,874 --> 00:24:58,808
He's here.

477
00:25:06,867 --> 00:25:08,605
He's counting them. Watch the fun.

478
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:12,178
Ten.

479
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:14,918
You said one guy,
but there are many here.

480
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:17,264
The guy in the flower
shirt teased me.

481
00:25:17,344 --> 00:25:19,324
The rest of the
guys are his friends.

482
00:25:19,964 --> 00:25:21,106
What do you want me to do?

483
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,812
Go beat them up.
- Are you mad?

484
00:25:23,892 --> 00:25:27,160
I'm alone and they are so many. How?

485
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,005
I told you.

486
00:25:31,632 --> 00:25:34,218
Brother! If you are
done with your discussions

487
00:25:34,298 --> 00:25:35,618
we would like to
continue our teasing.

488
00:25:36,025 --> 00:25:40,228
Arjun, please. Beat up that
dark fellow at least. Please.

489
00:25:40,308 --> 00:25:41,383
Anu, this is not about your ego.

490
00:25:41,463 --> 00:25:43,822
If we throw a stone in dung,
our clothes will get dirty.

491
00:25:43,902 --> 00:25:46,771
Let's go. - I'll wash them
clean with Surf at home. Please.

492
00:25:46,851 --> 00:25:48,717
Anu, please listen to me.
It's not safe. Let's go.

493
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,491
Let's go.
- But Arjun...

494
00:25:50,571 --> 00:25:52,079
Listen to me.
- Why is he taking her away?

495
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,452
Let's go.
- Girl!

496
00:25:53,605 --> 00:25:55,687
You said someone will
come and beat me up!

497
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:57,556
You!
- Anu, no! No!

498
00:25:57,636 --> 00:25:59,998
Is he scared? Is he very scared?

499
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,377
How scared is he?

500
00:26:01,457 --> 00:26:02,735
You rascal!
- Anu, no!

501
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:06,394
You shouldn't use bad words.
Let's go.

502
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:12,033
Brother! Chocolate boy!
You won't be able to handle her.

503
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:14,360
Leave your girlfriend to us.
We'll handle her.

504
00:26:14,972 --> 00:26:17,437
What do you say?
Hello! Did you hear me?

505
00:26:32,712 --> 00:26:33,901
Now watch him.

506
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:37,879
Is he the one who challenged me?

507
00:26:39,058 --> 00:26:40,528
Yes, he's the one.

508
00:26:40,608 --> 00:26:41,988
Is he?

509
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:52,732
Is he the one who tried
to hit me with a bat?

510
00:26:53,035 --> 00:26:54,473
Yes, he's the one.

511
00:26:57,003 --> 00:26:58,776
Where's the bat?
- It's there.

512
00:26:59,229 --> 00:27:00,370
Where?

513
00:27:00,639 --> 00:27:01,448
Go.

514
00:27:02,595 --> 00:27:04,515
It wasn't me. That fellow
tried to hit you with the bat.

515
00:27:04,595 --> 00:27:06,099
That fellow challenged you.

516
00:27:06,547 --> 00:27:07,516
But he told me to challenge you.

517
00:27:07,596 --> 00:27:09,375
When did I do that?
- He did.

518
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:10,758
So, I've to beat up everyone.

519
00:27:23,578 --> 00:27:24,659
Why did you stand again?

520
00:27:24,962 --> 00:27:26,410
Pure bad luck.

521
00:28:00,103 --> 00:28:01,487
Dishoom!

522
00:28:11,632 --> 00:28:13,068
Arjun! He's there. Beat him up.

523
00:28:14,495 --> 00:28:17,220
Beat him up! Break his back!

524
00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:24,258
Please, sir.

525
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:26,316
Please don't hit me.

526
00:28:27,728 --> 00:28:28,878
Oh no, I'm dead!

527
00:28:29,317 --> 00:28:30,718
Oh dear!

528
00:28:37,351 --> 00:28:39,192
Why did you come again?
- Bad luck, again.

529
00:28:39,382 --> 00:28:42,746
Sir, stop hitting us
and take your girlfriend home.

530
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:48,619
She's not my girlfriend.
Don't say that again.

531
00:28:52,675 --> 00:28:54,483
He hit me because I
said she is his girlfriend?

532
00:28:55,816 --> 00:28:56,810
Move aside.

533
00:28:58,894 --> 00:29:01,601
You were correct.
He doesn't treat me like a friend

534
00:29:01,817 --> 00:29:03,927
because he's my boyfriend.

535
00:30:19,711 --> 00:30:20,706
What are you doing here?

536
00:30:21,311 --> 00:30:22,375
Waiting for you.

537
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:23,577
For me?

538
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:24,563
Did you drink?

539
00:30:24,961 --> 00:30:25,981
Yes.

540
00:30:26,422 --> 00:30:27,330
Did you eat?

541
00:30:27,849 --> 00:30:28,931
I'll go home and eat.

542
00:30:29,813 --> 00:30:33,402
Uncle might see you
if you go home and eat now.

543
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,160
You'll be caught.
So, better to eat here.

544
00:30:36,895 --> 00:30:37,993
Come.

545
00:30:39,784 --> 00:30:41,150
Did you like the beans?

546
00:30:42,483 --> 00:30:44,238
Did you like the potato fry?

547
00:30:45,484 --> 00:30:47,006
Did you like the vegetable stew?

548
00:30:48,252 --> 00:30:49,318
And me?

549
00:30:50,363 --> 00:30:52,065
I mean, I cooked all those dishes.

550
00:30:53,337 --> 00:30:54,590
Why can't you say that you like me?

551
00:32:10,043 --> 00:32:12,346
Our people might not do their
jobs even after getting paid.

552
00:32:12,426 --> 00:32:14,508
But they definitely do
the job after taking a bribe.

553
00:32:15,826 --> 00:32:17,189
Did you take TC?

554
00:32:18,476 --> 00:32:20,227
I heard the recounting
results will be announced today.

555
00:32:20,562 --> 00:32:21,622
All the best!

556
00:32:24,757 --> 00:32:26,962
Why did he look so disinterested?

557
00:32:27,042 --> 00:32:30,302
He must be stressed.
- Hi, sir. I'm Meena. First year.

558
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:32,897
Yeah.
- What are you doing here, sir?

559
00:32:32,977 --> 00:32:35,566
I came for my TC and also
for the recounting results.

560
00:32:35,646 --> 00:32:37,458
He doesn't look stressed out now.

561
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,393
I see. We miss you a lot, sir.

562
00:32:39,473 --> 00:32:40,690
Really? Then take my phone number.

563
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:44,377
Call me when you miss me.
It's 9849015457.

564
00:32:44,457 --> 00:32:46,744
Thank you, sir. Bye.
- Call me. Bye.

565
00:32:47,653 --> 00:32:49,728
You finished college but
girls are still crazy about you.

566
00:32:49,808 --> 00:32:50,792
Come here.
- Yes, ma'am?

567
00:32:50,872 --> 00:32:52,816
Give me your phone.
Do you miss him a lot?

568
00:32:52,896 --> 00:32:54,650
Ma'am?
- Is that why you took his number?

569
00:32:58,818 --> 00:33:02,261
Let's go. Come on. Come.

570
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,553
The results are out.

571
00:33:07,423 --> 00:33:10,712
Whoa! What's this?
I've never seen anything like this.

572
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:12,191
Did he give very less marks?

573
00:33:13,446 --> 00:33:15,253
Will anyone believe
that I got such high marks?

574
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:16,585
I don't believe it.

575
00:33:16,914 --> 00:33:19,664
People usually get two
or five marks more in recounting.

576
00:33:19,863 --> 00:33:22,648
But he gave you fifty,
sixty and seventy marks.

577
00:33:22,728 --> 00:33:26,151
It's a miracle, uncle. In fact he
scored more than me in one subject.

578
00:33:26,342 --> 00:33:27,838
That's why I can't believe it.

579
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:30,700
Uncle, actually he was
very tense during the exam and

580
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,758
forgot to tie his additional papers.
They went missing.

581
00:33:32,838 --> 00:33:34,124
Now they found the missing papers.

582
00:33:34,204 --> 00:33:35,888
So, they corrected
them and gave him marks...

583
00:33:36,165 --> 00:33:37,316
So many marks?

584
00:33:37,396 --> 00:33:38,569
Yeah.

585
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,321
So, you can't even tie
your additional papers properly.

586
00:33:45,411 --> 00:33:46,812
Now you'll scold me on that point?

587
00:33:47,097 --> 00:33:49,549
Yes. - I've been noticing
this ever since I came.

588
00:33:49,688 --> 00:33:51,646
Instead of being happy that I passed

589
00:33:51,726 --> 00:33:53,372
you are upset that
I actually managed to pass.

590
00:33:54,573 --> 00:33:56,462
What?
- Congrats!

591
00:33:56,542 --> 00:33:57,761
You insulted me in
front of a small kid.

592
00:33:57,841 --> 00:33:59,021
Do you think I forgot about it?

593
00:34:00,086 --> 00:34:02,328
No! I don't like it!
- Stop it now.

594
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:03,546
I won't.

595
00:34:04,396 --> 00:34:06,645
Sorry, son.
- I don't want your apology.

596
00:34:06,859 --> 00:34:08,513
I'm proud of you, son.

597
00:34:09,954 --> 00:34:10,881
Listen to me.

598
00:34:12,403 --> 00:34:14,264
Take this.
- I don't want your money.

599
00:34:14,472 --> 00:34:16,291
Go and celebrate with your friends.

600
00:34:16,371 --> 00:34:18,858
You shouldn't refuse loving
gifts from your parents.

601
00:34:18,938 --> 00:34:20,892
Just take it. Thanks, uncle.
- Give that to me.

602
00:34:21,757 --> 00:34:23,597
Smile. Come on, smile.

603
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:26,752
Why does everyone look so happy?

604
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:29,208
Arjun passed in all
subjects in recounting.

605
00:34:29,288 --> 00:34:30,343
He passed with distinction.

606
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:34,784
Thank God! At least they
did the job after taking money.

607
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:35,781
Money?

608
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,240
What money?

609
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,879
Aunt meant that recounting
fee didn't go waste.

610
00:34:41,364 --> 00:34:42,900
True.
- That's right.

611
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,107
Dad, ask him to write GMAT too.

612
00:34:45,308 --> 00:34:46,920
Son...
- I can't write GMAT. I can't.

613
00:34:47,072 --> 00:34:50,444
Please write GMAT, my boy.
Please write it for my sake.

614
00:34:50,524 --> 00:34:52,107
Okay, I'll do it for you.

615
00:34:52,903 --> 00:34:54,826
If Arjun takes the exam,
I'll take it too.

616
00:34:55,055 --> 00:34:56,598
Anu, I said no.

617
00:34:56,743 --> 00:34:57,753
Uncle...

618
00:34:58,112 --> 00:35:00,548
Let her do it if that's what
she wants. Why are you refusing?

619
00:35:00,628 --> 00:35:02,942
I want her to get married
and she wants to study.

620
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,740
Okay, let's do one thing.

621
00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:07,280
I'll find a bridegroom
who's settled abroad. Marry him.

622
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,383
You can study as much
as you want after going there.

623
00:35:09,463 --> 00:35:10,345
Good idea.

624
00:35:11,252 --> 00:35:12,379
It's rubbish.

625
00:35:12,691 --> 00:35:16,268
Anu, wait! Anu!
Listen to me before walking away.

626
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:22,279
I feel very satisfied
when I see her crying.

627
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:24,459
You are a sadist.
- I like it.

628
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,248
That's enough.
Arrange funds for GMAT.

629
00:35:29,144 --> 00:35:30,500
Why do you want so much money?

630
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,154
Won't you give me unless I tell you?

631
00:35:32,957 --> 00:35:34,119
It's not that.

632
00:35:34,645 --> 00:35:36,825
Money is a bit tight this month.

633
00:35:37,703 --> 00:35:40,104
Okay, wait.
I'll borrow it from Saritha aunt.

634
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:43,038
Oh no, aunt.
I don't need it that bad.

635
00:35:44,117 --> 00:35:45,951
Forget it. See you.

636
00:35:47,376 --> 00:35:49,541
I want a drink.
- I couldn't arrange the funds.

637
00:35:49,922 --> 00:35:51,403
Will your brother-in-law...

638
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,776
He won't agree if you
don't pay him upfront.

639
00:35:53,935 --> 00:35:55,188
He's a money-minded fellow.

640
00:35:55,506 --> 00:35:57,305
Can you arrange anything, man?

641
00:35:58,211 --> 00:35:59,837
I've borrowed from
so many people that

642
00:35:59,917 --> 00:36:01,760
I'm changing sim cards
in my phone constantly.

643
00:36:02,044 --> 00:36:03,137
What do I do now?

644
00:36:03,705 --> 00:36:04,611
Anu is coming.

645
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,871
Arjun.

646
00:36:09,579 --> 00:36:10,443
What's this?

647
00:36:10,707 --> 00:36:12,173
I heard you need money.

648
00:36:12,326 --> 00:36:13,889
Take it. Just take it.

649
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,235
Thank her.

650
00:36:19,896 --> 00:36:21,335
Thanks.
- Be careful.

651
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,663
Why?

652
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:26,573
The fact that you want
such a big amount of money

653
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:29,035
tells me that you
are doing something wrong

654
00:36:29,115 --> 00:36:31,083
but I realize that you
might not have another choice.

655
00:36:31,367 --> 00:36:33,055
So, be careful.

656
00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:38,520
Anu is such a sweet girl.

657
00:36:41,102 --> 00:36:42,043
Here's the money.

658
00:36:42,749 --> 00:36:44,001
He'll be writing your exam.

659
00:36:44,081 --> 00:36:45,690
It's his thousandth exam.
Wish him luck.

660
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:46,807
What? This man?

661
00:36:46,887 --> 00:36:48,153
I need to find Sweetie.

662
00:36:48,305 --> 00:36:49,792
He looks exactly like me, right?
- What? No way.

663
00:36:49,872 --> 00:36:50,948
He doesn't look like you at all.
- Stop it.

664
00:36:51,294 --> 00:36:53,030
Brother, all the best.

665
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,497
Write the exam well.
Take God's offerings.

666
00:36:55,828 --> 00:36:56,977
Go in. Write well.

667
00:36:58,562 --> 00:36:59,475
All the best!

668
00:37:01,661 --> 00:37:02,699
I'm tensed.

669
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,405
Paper was very tough, bro.
I tried my best.

670
00:37:13,408 --> 00:37:14,549
I've to write another exam.

671
00:37:22,748 --> 00:37:25,156
Huh? What the! What is this?

672
00:37:38,067 --> 00:37:39,215
Happy GMAT!

673
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:44,717
Chintu! Wait.

674
00:37:45,658 --> 00:37:47,671
He refused to go to
school when he was a kid.

675
00:37:47,751 --> 00:37:50,868
It's amazing that he
scored such good marks.

676
00:37:51,255 --> 00:37:53,130
I trust... Wait, dear.

677
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:55,897
I trust that you'll
take good care of Arjun.

678
00:37:55,977 --> 00:37:57,448
Okay, aunt.
- Very naughty.

679
00:37:57,635 --> 00:37:59,289
He used to pee on
me when I carried him.

680
00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:01,613
Unbelievable score. Very rare.

681
00:38:01,751 --> 00:38:03,827
His planets are in
favorable positions.

682
00:38:04,526 --> 00:38:07,189
'After my fourth birthday
party celebration'

683
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:10,628
'this is the biggest
party my dad threw for me.'

684
00:38:10,836 --> 00:38:13,811
'It felt really good
to see him so happy.'

685
00:38:14,122 --> 00:38:16,786
'But I didn't achieve
it on my own merit.'

686
00:38:17,027 --> 00:38:18,432
'Whenever I thought of that...'

687
00:38:18,688 --> 00:38:19,802
Forget it!

688
00:38:21,095 --> 00:38:22,057
Sir!

689
00:38:22,604 --> 00:38:23,420
Welcome, sir.

690
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,920
Wow! This looks like
a film's 100 days function!

691
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,092
All thanks to you.

692
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:28,791
Come, I'll introduce you to my dad.
- Okay.

693
00:38:28,871 --> 00:38:30,629
Please sit.
- Dad, he's Mr. Sarvesh.

694
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:32,733
I scored so well because
of his GMAT coaching classes.

695
00:38:33,176 --> 00:38:34,593
I'm so happy to see you.
- Hello, sir.

696
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,231
Why are your hands empty?
Would you like a drink?

697
00:38:36,311 --> 00:38:38,157
Yeah, sure.
- Waiter! Come here.

698
00:38:39,154 --> 00:38:41,167
I forgot. I've to introduce
you to everyone first.

699
00:38:41,247 --> 00:38:42,198
Okay.
- I remember it well...

700
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,621
Meet Mr. Sarvesh.
My son scored so well

701
00:38:44,701 --> 00:38:46,206
because he attended
his coaching classes.

702
00:38:46,286 --> 00:38:48,625
He's a great man. Come. I've
to introduce you to so many people.

703
00:38:49,179 --> 00:38:51,199
Mr. George! He's Sarvesh.

704
00:38:51,437 --> 00:38:53,031
My son has studied
in his coaching classes

705
00:38:53,111 --> 00:38:55,045
and got first rank.
He's a great man.

706
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,357
Come to the next table.

707
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:57,918
Why do you look sad, my boy?

708
00:38:58,162 --> 00:39:00,193
Why did you do this, uncle?
- What did I do?

709
00:39:00,403 --> 00:39:02,794
Why did you score
so well in the exam

710
00:39:03,154 --> 00:39:06,060
when you know studying
will make you an employee?

711
00:39:07,383 --> 00:39:10,460
Anyway, I'll grow up
and start my own company.

712
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,322
Then I'll give you a job there.
Don't worry.

713
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:15,010
Bless me, uncle.

714
00:39:18,486 --> 00:39:19,981
You ruined his mind. Idiot.

715
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:23,346
This man gave my son
the best results of the...

716
00:39:23,426 --> 00:39:24,951
Sir! Please stop it!

717
00:39:25,145 --> 00:39:26,634
You! Come here!

718
00:39:31,951 --> 00:39:33,118
One more.

719
00:39:36,121 --> 00:39:37,072
Continue.

720
00:39:37,548 --> 00:39:39,079
You go.
Continue, sir.

721
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:40,194
He's thirsty.

722
00:39:42,754 --> 00:39:45,011
My dad threw a really grand party.

723
00:39:50,244 --> 00:39:51,230
Arjun!

724
00:39:52,068 --> 00:39:53,331
Why didn't you go to sleep yet?

725
00:39:53,711 --> 00:39:55,441
I'm upset, Arjun.

726
00:39:55,666 --> 00:39:57,041
I had a fight with mom.

727
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,597
I see.

728
00:39:58,677 --> 00:40:00,751
She doesn't want me
to take the GMAT exam.

729
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,475
She wants to get me married.

730
00:40:05,033 --> 00:40:07,178
I don't want to get
married so soon, Arjun.

731
00:40:08,025 --> 00:40:09,573
I want to study.

732
00:40:11,736 --> 00:40:13,267
I want to be with you.

733
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:16,899
Please talk to my mom.

734
00:40:17,202 --> 00:40:19,970
What? Anu, how can I...
- What will you do, Arjun?

735
00:40:20,861 --> 00:40:22,063
Will you just leave?

736
00:40:22,902 --> 00:40:25,817
Will you leave me here?
Why can't you stay back?

737
00:40:28,117 --> 00:40:29,328
I'll miss you.

738
00:40:37,086 --> 00:40:38,254
You'll be fine.

739
00:40:53,294 --> 00:40:54,671
AFTER TWO WEEKS

740
00:40:56,075 --> 00:40:58,027
Hello, sir. Is everything okay?

741
00:40:58,573 --> 00:41:00,233
I hope you've started
the visa process.

742
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,226
When should I book my flight ticket?

743
00:41:03,444 --> 00:41:05,305
There's a small problem.

744
00:41:05,803 --> 00:41:07,519
Your admission is
in the waiting list.

745
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,691
What do you mean?

746
00:41:11,367 --> 00:41:14,660
Two other students applied
to the same university.

747
00:41:15,089 --> 00:41:18,409
They scored one mark
more than you in GMAT.

748
00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:19,371
So?

749
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:23,571
There are only two seats
left in the university. So...

750
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,239
Do you mean it is difficult?

751
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:38,052
Okay, then try to get me
into another good university.

752
00:41:40,806 --> 00:41:42,017
You'll be okay with it?

753
00:41:43,013 --> 00:41:45,726
We can try. What can you
do if it doesn't work? It's okay.

754
00:41:45,892 --> 00:41:46,964
Thank God!

755
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:49,988
Yes!

756
00:41:50,853 --> 00:41:52,853
I never imagined that
you'll be so cool about it.

757
00:41:53,193 --> 00:41:55,247
Thank God! Did he agree to it?
- Yes, Sweetie.

758
00:41:55,327 --> 00:41:57,194
Should I start Anupama's
admission process?

759
00:42:02,618 --> 00:42:04,438
Hello, madam! Hello, wait!

760
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,500
Such a stupid...

761
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,785
What did she say?
- Nothing.

762
00:42:11,965 --> 00:42:13,280
What did she say?
- Nothing. No.

763
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,364
She said nothing.

764
00:42:15,543 --> 00:42:16,380
Nothing.

765
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,788
Who are the candidates
who scored more than me?

766
00:42:23,071 --> 00:42:23,881
Tell me.

767
00:42:25,507 --> 00:42:26,635
Adivi Shankara Shastri.

768
00:42:27,106 --> 00:42:29,437
He has four years'
work experience in Infosys.

769
00:42:29,517 --> 00:42:31,417
Who is the other candidate?

770
00:42:34,683 --> 00:42:35,727
Tell me.

771
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,004
No, don't tell him.

772
00:42:40,011 --> 00:42:41,021
Panpama.

773
00:42:41,101 --> 00:42:42,543
There you go. Panpama.
- Panpama!

774
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:44,702
Panpama!

775
00:42:45,816 --> 00:42:47,269
P. Anupama.

776
00:42:48,798 --> 00:42:49,940
Panpama?

777
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,064
Panpama?

778
00:42:52,217 --> 00:42:53,781
Actually the thing is...

779
00:42:54,827 --> 00:42:56,902
Hi, sir. My name is Anupama.

780
00:42:57,205 --> 00:42:58,814
Arjun and I are close friends.

781
00:42:58,986 --> 00:43:03,069
Can you get me a seat in
the college that Arjun applied to?

782
00:43:03,423 --> 00:43:06,139
Yeah, sure.
- But it's a surprise for him.

783
00:43:06,294 --> 00:43:07,583
So please don't tell him.

784
00:43:08,915 --> 00:43:12,210
I didn't know that you dislike
her until your friends told me.

785
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,274
I swear.

786
00:43:14,459 --> 00:43:16,690
You said you'll be okay
with other universities.

787
00:43:17,036 --> 00:43:19,553
Take a look! Whichever you want.

788
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,070
You can take your pick.
So many choices.

789
00:43:22,494 --> 00:43:23,826
Fly like a bird.

790
00:43:26,326 --> 00:43:28,255
Oh my God! It's expensive!

791
00:43:28,335 --> 00:43:29,596
Do you know how
expensive this laptop is?

792
00:43:29,676 --> 00:43:30,711
The memory is one TB.

793
00:43:31,429 --> 00:43:34,076
How dare you hit me?
Control him! He's gone mad!

794
00:43:34,156 --> 00:43:36,852
Sarvesh! Stop right there!
Am I not paying you? Stop him!

795
00:43:37,575 --> 00:43:40,178
You got me into trouble
and you are flirting with him.

796
00:43:40,258 --> 00:43:42,764
Go stop him!
Go! Stop him!

797
00:43:44,419 --> 00:43:45,717
Okay.

798
00:43:48,562 --> 00:43:50,776
Hello, Siri.
Call Panjagutta Police Station.

799
00:43:50,954 --> 00:43:53,638
You attacked me!
And you'll file a complaint on me?

800
00:43:53,718 --> 00:43:56,641
I'll expose your scams and frauds.

801
00:43:56,721 --> 00:43:57,783
Then they will arrest me.

802
00:43:57,863 --> 00:43:58,972
You are right, sir.

803
00:43:59,484 --> 00:44:00,549
Snatch his phone!

804
00:44:01,428 --> 00:44:02,459
Give me the phone.

805
00:44:04,674 --> 00:44:09,289
[Gibberish]

806
00:44:10,153 --> 00:44:11,315
Say it without crying.

807
00:44:12,457 --> 00:44:15,398
I have a beautiful
wife and a son at home.

808
00:44:15,478 --> 00:44:17,211
Sir...
- I have her at the office.

809
00:44:17,291 --> 00:44:18,560
High maintenance.

810
00:44:18,782 --> 00:44:20,518
We will all be on the streets.

811
00:44:20,598 --> 00:44:21,847
Button your shirt.

812
00:44:22,532 --> 00:44:25,203
Don't look at her.
- Will you get me the seat or not?

813
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:27,984
No, I can't do it. I just can't.
- Boss! Boss!

814
00:44:29,098 --> 00:44:29,963
He says it's difficult.

815
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:30,908
He'll get you into another college.

816
00:44:30,988 --> 00:44:32,940
No, I want a seat
in that very college.

817
00:44:33,067 --> 00:44:35,182
Otherwise my father
will say that Anu got a seat

818
00:44:35,262 --> 00:44:37,107
in the best college and
that I should learn from me.

819
00:44:37,251 --> 00:44:39,293
I can't bear to hear it again...

820
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:42,138
Get up! Will you
get me the seat or not?

821
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:44,639
Answer me! Answer me!

822
00:44:44,928 --> 00:44:48,249
That's not in my hands.
One of them should drop out.

823
00:44:50,086 --> 00:44:51,115
What did you say?

824
00:44:51,259 --> 00:44:52,532
One of them should drop
out for you to get a seat...

825
00:44:52,612 --> 00:44:53,861
I'll get a seat if
one of them drops out?

826
00:44:55,338 --> 00:44:56,273
How will you do it?

827
00:45:00,501 --> 00:45:01,420
Cute boy.

828
00:45:06,966 --> 00:45:08,776
Congrats, aunt.
When will you throw a party?

829
00:45:09,162 --> 00:45:10,220
For what?

830
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,930
Anu is a top scorer in GMAT exam.

831
00:45:13,756 --> 00:45:14,897
Did she take the exam?

832
00:45:15,683 --> 00:45:18,887
I thought you knew.
Sorry, aunt. I'm sorry.

833
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:21,390
No, wait. Tell me everything.

834
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:25,852
She'll be upset with me if
she finds out that I told you, so...

835
00:45:27,988 --> 00:45:29,754
We both are always
on the same side, right?

836
00:45:31,376 --> 00:45:32,705
Did she really take the GMAT exam?

837
00:45:32,785 --> 00:45:35,344
She applied in Turino
School Of Management.

838
00:45:35,638 --> 00:45:40,614
She should've told you about it.
I wonder why she didn't.

839
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:44,135
She's being very
disobedient nowadays.

840
00:45:44,478 --> 00:45:45,691
Really?

841
00:45:46,654 --> 00:45:50,063
We can love our kids but
we can't control their wishes.

842
00:45:50,143 --> 00:45:53,124
Let her do what she wants.
- So, you'll let her do it?

843
00:45:53,204 --> 00:45:54,663
What else can I do?

844
00:45:56,533 --> 00:45:59,688
You've a point.
You've to take a back step.

845
00:46:00,147 --> 00:46:03,457
When it comes to her
studies and her marriage too.

846
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:05,462
What about marriage?

847
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:08,091
If she doesn't obey you
with regard to her education

848
00:46:08,234 --> 00:46:09,812
how can you expect her
to obey you about marriage?

849
00:46:10,864 --> 00:46:13,327
But I've some dreams about
her future as her mother.

850
00:46:13,477 --> 00:46:14,573
She won't care.

851
00:46:17,284 --> 00:46:18,779
Do you doubt me? Go ask her.

852
00:46:19,891 --> 00:46:20,722
Go.

853
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,001
Are you happy now?

854
00:46:28,178 --> 00:46:29,041
Very happy.

855
00:46:30,004 --> 00:46:31,515
How will you tell aunt?

856
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,003
I'll ask Arjun to convince mom.

857
00:46:38,042 --> 00:46:39,204
I heard that you wrote GMAT exam.

858
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:41,905
Who told you?

859
00:46:41,985 --> 00:46:43,671
I heard that you applied
for a college seat.

860
00:46:44,818 --> 00:46:46,102
How did you find out?

861
00:46:46,455 --> 00:46:49,134
That is not important.
When did you plan to tell me?

862
00:46:49,843 --> 00:46:51,338
Stop pestering me.

863
00:46:51,952 --> 00:46:54,016
What? I'm pestering you?

864
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:56,662
I didn't tell you because
I knew you'd make a scene.

865
00:46:56,742 --> 00:46:58,090
Did you ever plan to tell me?

866
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,504
Of course.
You've to pay the fee, after all.

867
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:03,305
Yes. You need me only for the money.

868
00:47:05,164 --> 00:47:05,989
Yes.

869
00:47:12,865 --> 00:47:14,879
What's that?
- Foreign marriage alliances.

870
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:18,183
You can study as much as you want

871
00:47:18,826 --> 00:47:21,006
but only after marrying
the guy I choose for you.

872
00:47:22,254 --> 00:47:23,605
Select one of these photos...

873
00:47:25,166 --> 00:47:27,197
I've been really patient with you.

874
00:47:28,372 --> 00:47:29,302
But it's enough.

875
00:47:29,789 --> 00:47:31,106
How dare you talk to me like that?

876
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:33,901
What's that look?

877
00:47:34,713 --> 00:47:35,896
Answer me!

878
00:47:36,138 --> 00:47:38,774
I'll decide my education,
my marriage and my future!

879
00:47:40,019 --> 00:47:41,105
You've nothing to do with it!

880
00:47:41,185 --> 00:47:43,167
I have no say in it?
- No!

881
00:47:45,402 --> 00:47:46,655
Do you have a boyfriend?

882
00:47:48,197 --> 00:47:50,197
I won't marry the
guy you choose for me.

883
00:47:53,553 --> 00:47:54,653
Yes!

884
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:58,548
'I'll get the college
seat and she'll get married.'

885
00:48:00,596 --> 00:48:01,475
What's this?

886
00:48:02,367 --> 00:48:04,720
Your mother wants
to get you married.

887
00:48:04,864 --> 00:48:06,795
I told her I want to study
and don't want to get married.

888
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:09,563
Why should I listen to
you if you don't listen to me?

889
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:12,136
So? You'll exact revenge?

890
00:48:12,216 --> 00:48:13,244
You can take it
as whatever you like.

891
00:48:14,179 --> 00:48:16,303
I won't get married.
What will you do?

892
00:48:18,524 --> 00:48:22,061
I won't pay your fees even
if you get a seat in the college.

893
00:48:22,141 --> 00:48:23,673
What? Are you serious?

894
00:48:24,295 --> 00:48:26,295
Shailu!
- Please.

895
00:48:26,841 --> 00:48:28,370
You wouldn't support her
if you had seen

896
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:30,148
the way she spoke to me last night.

897
00:48:30,765 --> 00:48:34,016
Oh. So, it's about last night?

898
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,966
Fine. I'm sorry.

899
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:42,021
I was rude to you because
I was in a bad mood.

900
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:45,189
I'll fall at your feet if you want.
- Stop your drama.

901
00:48:47,064 --> 00:48:48,891
Listen, dear...
- This is not done, uncle.

902
00:48:49,285 --> 00:48:50,621
She's behaving like a sadist.

903
00:48:50,973 --> 00:48:52,571
I don't understand
why she's so egotistic.

904
00:48:52,651 --> 00:48:54,674
I'm egotistic?
- Shailu,

905
00:48:55,007 --> 00:48:57,089
making a girl cry will
bring a curse on your family.

906
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,114
Will my tears bring her good luck?

907
00:49:01,055 --> 00:49:03,124
If I don't like something,
she should try to convince me

908
00:49:03,204 --> 00:49:04,529
but she just went behind my back.

909
00:49:04,937 --> 00:49:07,386
She said she won't marry
the guy I choose for her.

910
00:49:07,466 --> 00:49:09,040
Then what's the use
of being her mother?

911
00:49:10,687 --> 00:49:13,143
Mark my words.

912
00:49:13,773 --> 00:49:16,811
She can go for higher
studies after I die.

913
00:49:16,984 --> 00:49:18,452
Then die right now.
Please don't ruin my life...

914
00:49:18,532 --> 00:49:19,393
Anu!

915
00:49:19,552 --> 00:49:20,472
Oh dear...

916
00:49:23,219 --> 00:49:24,526
How dare you say that to your mom?

917
00:49:26,256 --> 00:49:27,571
Do you know what you are saying?

918
00:49:28,608 --> 00:49:30,981
Older ones say many
things in their anger.

919
00:49:31,061 --> 00:49:32,330
It doesn't mean you
should wish for their death.

920
00:49:33,153 --> 00:49:34,454
Learn from Arjun.

921
00:49:34,821 --> 00:49:37,588
He doesn't back answer me
no matter how much I scold him.

922
00:49:46,626 --> 00:49:50,397
'The small fire that I
lit almost destroyed a family.'

923
00:49:51,095 --> 00:49:54,866
'I wanted to start a fight,
but expect this big war.'

924
00:50:17,953 --> 00:50:19,596
They want me to get married, Arjun.

925
00:50:19,898 --> 00:50:22,718
What do I do? You tell me.

926
00:50:24,931 --> 00:50:28,547
I'm sure the older
ones know better than us.

927
00:50:31,141 --> 00:50:34,194
It's not right to
hurt so many people, Anu.

928
00:50:36,668 --> 00:50:37,810
Get married.

929
00:50:42,653 --> 00:50:43,881
I'll get married.

930
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:48,335
I won't study.

931
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:54,502
What did you say to her?

932
00:54:39,539 --> 00:54:40,715
Arjun!

933
00:55:51,656 --> 00:55:55,583
Why did you do this?
Tell me! Say something!

934
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:00,192
How can I go out and face anyone?

935
00:56:00,474 --> 00:56:02,466
Answer me! Why did you do this?

936
00:56:02,546 --> 00:56:04,164
Look how he's peeking
inside after what did.

937
00:56:04,244 --> 00:56:05,721
You brought disgrace to me.

938
00:56:06,378 --> 00:56:07,970
Ouch! Please let me go, dad.

939
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:09,674
You think you can run
away after what you did?

940
00:56:09,754 --> 00:56:11,567
Please let me go.
- No!

941
00:56:11,647 --> 00:56:13,106
Come inside!
- Answer me!

942
00:56:13,186 --> 00:56:15,485
Why are you quiet now?

943
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,832
Stop, dear!
You shouldn't hit a girl like that.

944
00:56:18,912 --> 00:56:21,037
Calm down. Just calm down.
- What else should I do?

945
00:56:21,383 --> 00:56:25,024
She's such a disgrace.
She ruined her own life.

946
00:56:25,104 --> 00:56:26,322
See how she's looking at me.

947
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:29,911
Which idiot will want
to marry such a shameless girl?

948
00:56:37,824 --> 00:56:39,286
Why are you all looking at me?

949
00:56:39,366 --> 00:56:41,301
Arjun.
- Dad.

950
00:56:41,518 --> 00:56:43,576
Arjun.
- Mom.

951
00:56:43,827 --> 00:56:44,917
Arjun.

952
00:56:45,194 --> 00:56:46,802
Sis. Stop it, all of you.

953
00:56:46,975 --> 00:56:48,532
Anu is a very good girl.

954
00:56:49,977 --> 00:56:50,917
Yes.

955
00:56:50,997 --> 00:56:54,593
Son, I always have your
best interests at heart. - So?

956
00:56:54,788 --> 00:56:57,383
We love Anu as much as we love you.

957
00:56:57,463 --> 00:56:59,061
So?
- Poor girl.

958
00:57:00,073 --> 00:57:01,759
Taking the present circumstances

959
00:57:01,975 --> 00:57:03,860
and the futures of
you both into consideration

960
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,282
I think it's best if you marry Anu.

961
00:57:06,362 --> 00:57:08,816
No way, Justice Chowdhary.
No way.

962
00:57:08,896 --> 00:57:11,056
My life will be ruined
if I marry her. - Why?

963
00:57:11,325 --> 00:57:14,741
I don't like her, mom.
- Why not? She's a beautiful girl.

964
00:57:14,821 --> 00:57:17,206
What rubbish?
She's just an average looking girl.

965
00:57:19,274 --> 00:57:21,721
Dad, I rejected many
hot girls in college.

966
00:57:21,801 --> 00:57:23,814
Everyone will laugh
at me if I marry her.

967
00:57:23,894 --> 00:57:27,041
Everyone is already laughing
at us after yesterday's scene.

968
00:57:27,404 --> 00:57:29,678
Brother, don't scold Arjun.
- But he...

969
00:57:29,758 --> 00:57:31,858
What did he do?
- Exactly, aunt.

970
00:57:32,117 --> 00:57:35,325
What did I do? You are
the only one who understands me.

971
00:57:35,405 --> 00:57:38,490
Mom, Arjun is the
only one I want to marry.

972
00:57:38,793 --> 00:57:40,021
Otherwise,
I'll remain single forever.

973
00:57:42,396 --> 00:57:44,915
Don't be ridiculous. I said no.

974
00:57:50,171 --> 00:57:52,290
Arjun.
- Aunt.

975
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:56,684
We both are always
on the same side, right?

976
00:57:56,909 --> 00:57:57,982
Yes.

977
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:01,571
I always helped you
in your times of need.

978
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:03,051
So?

979
00:58:03,786 --> 00:58:06,095
But I've never asked
you for anything.

980
00:58:06,545 --> 00:58:07,851
So?

981
00:58:08,249 --> 00:58:13,905
Just this one time.
Do it for me, please.

982
00:58:18,035 --> 00:58:19,903
Yes. It all happened very quickly.

983
00:58:19,983 --> 00:58:22,650
Yes, call him once.
You are his tenth class friend.

984
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:23,905
He'll feel bad if
you don't call him.

985
00:58:24,867 --> 00:58:28,165
He didn't sleep all night.
He's not in a position to talk.

986
00:58:29,127 --> 00:58:33,722
Uncle! Why did your
life turn upside down?

987
00:58:41,657 --> 00:58:43,765
Are you crying?

988
00:58:44,242 --> 00:58:45,453
Then sign.

989
00:58:50,262 --> 00:58:51,490
Just do it.

990
00:58:52,121 --> 00:58:54,603
Don't you want to marry her?

991
00:58:58,989 --> 00:59:00,736
Just sign.
- I'm doing it, you idiot!

992
00:59:00,816 --> 00:59:02,483
How dare you talk
to your father like that!

993
00:59:02,906 --> 00:59:04,575
Calm down.
Otherwise he'll refuse to sign.

994
00:59:04,655 --> 00:59:06,201
I thought it was Yanam.
- It's okay.

995
00:59:06,281 --> 00:59:09,419
Just sign it. Come on, do it. Do it.

996
00:59:11,832 --> 00:59:13,052
Thank God! It's done.

997
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:15,090
Remove the garlands, dear.

998
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:17,173
Here, take the garland. Take it.

999
00:59:17,968 --> 00:59:20,937
Bend your head.
Put it in his neck, dear.

1000
00:59:21,228 --> 00:59:22,362
Look up. Now it's your turn.

1001
00:59:23,137 --> 00:59:25,718
Put it in her neck.
You come into the garland, dear.

1002
00:59:27,458 --> 00:59:28,648
That's it.
Here, tie the wedding chain.

1003
00:59:28,892 --> 00:59:31,150
Yeah, one last thing.
Tie it, son. Tie it.

1004
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:33,138
Hurry up.
- Tie it, Arjun.

1005
00:59:33,218 --> 00:59:36,780
Do it, son. Don't dally.
The auspicious time will pass.

1006
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:40,080
Tie it. Come on, tie it.
It's almost over. Tie it, son.

1007
00:59:40,611 --> 00:59:43,047
Come on, tie it. Go ahead.

1008
00:59:44,923 --> 00:59:48,560
Dad, she's smiling. I won't tie it.
- Dear, don't smile until he ties it.

1009
00:59:50,226 --> 00:59:52,839
Tie it now.
She won't smile again. Tie it.

1010
00:59:53,287 --> 00:59:57,689
That's it.
You don't move, dear. Stay put.

1011
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,881
Dad, he didn't tie the third knot.

1012
01:00:01,659 --> 01:00:02,702
You should tie three knots.

1013
01:00:02,782 --> 01:00:03,975
This is wrong.
- I thought he did.

1014
01:00:04,102 --> 01:00:05,370
Tie the third knot. Go ahead.
- Arjun...

1015
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:07,279
Just do it, son. Do it. That's it.

1016
01:00:07,407 --> 01:00:09,483
Third knot. That's it.

1017
01:00:09,826 --> 01:00:13,579
It's over. You ruined my life, dad.

1018
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,304
It's over. It's over.

1019
01:00:37,649 --> 01:00:39,673
Tell him, mom.
- No, you tell him.

1020
01:00:39,867 --> 01:00:41,174
Dad, come with me.

1021
01:00:41,254 --> 01:00:42,779
You've to talk to Arjun.
- What?

1022
01:00:42,966 --> 01:00:45,076
Just come with me, I'll tell you.
- Settle his dues.

1023
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:47,457
What's wrong, dear?

1024
01:00:48,217 --> 01:00:50,742
He's playing games.
- He's playing?

1025
01:00:51,711 --> 01:00:53,129
Oh no!

1026
01:00:59,668 --> 01:01:01,484
Didn't you go inside yet?

1027
01:01:03,457 --> 01:01:06,346
Go in, son. You can play later. Go.

1028
01:01:06,501 --> 01:01:08,628
Grandpa, don't disturb us.
We are playing.

1029
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:10,695
Take him inside first.
- Chintu! Come with me.

1030
01:01:10,775 --> 01:01:12,226
You have no sense of time.
- Mom! I don't want to go.

1031
01:01:12,306 --> 01:01:15,236
Mom! I want to play. Please, mom.

1032
01:01:15,408 --> 01:01:17,380
Go downstairs.
- Mom, please.

1033
01:01:17,613 --> 01:01:19,801
You can play later. Go inside.
- I don't want to go.

1034
01:01:22,992 --> 01:01:25,362
Just go inside.
You'll slowly get used to it.

1035
01:01:25,442 --> 01:01:28,127
Don't say indecent things to me.
I'll go.

1036
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:37,620
Darn! No father should
face such a situation!

1037
01:01:38,077 --> 01:01:38,976
Too much.

1038
01:01:42,145 --> 01:01:43,189
Stupid flowers.

1039
01:01:46,345 --> 01:01:47,805
Will you drink milk, Arjun?

1040
01:01:48,545 --> 01:01:50,988
Mix some poison in it.
I'll drink it and die.

1041
01:01:54,199 --> 01:01:56,523
Don't look at me like
you'll pull my eyes out!

1042
01:01:57,623 --> 01:02:01,774
My life is ruined. It's ruined.

1043
01:02:05,614 --> 01:02:08,735
Then why did you try
to ruin my life, Arjun?

1044
01:02:10,464 --> 01:02:12,048
What are you talking about?

1045
01:02:16,227 --> 01:02:17,368
I know everything.

1046
01:02:20,587 --> 01:02:22,464
I think even Alfred Hitchcock

1047
01:02:22,544 --> 01:02:24,461
hasn't created a psychotic
character like you.

1048
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:27,082
What a plan! What a setting!

1049
01:02:27,162 --> 01:02:29,935
You forced Anu into
marriage for a college seat.

1050
01:02:30,015 --> 01:02:32,382
Yeah.
- Genius! You are a genius, man!

1051
01:02:32,462 --> 01:02:34,021
Someone may hear you.
- Who will hear me?

1052
01:02:34,101 --> 01:02:35,440
She'll be married in two days.

1053
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,551
She'll go to her in-laws
and he'll go to Dubai.

1054
01:02:37,631 --> 01:02:38,602
Perfect!

1055
01:02:42,379 --> 01:02:44,074
Anu! Is everything okay?

1056
01:02:44,154 --> 01:02:46,607
Yes, uncle. We started it just now.

1057
01:02:47,735 --> 01:02:48,759
It's okay, dear.

1058
01:02:48,946 --> 01:02:50,655
You take the lead
and take care of him.

1059
01:02:51,043 --> 01:02:53,036
Arjun! Learn from Anu.

1060
01:02:53,257 --> 01:02:54,212
Don't be scared.

1061
01:02:56,847 --> 01:02:58,563
Arjun! I've just
two questions for you.

1062
01:02:59,003 --> 01:03:01,500
Are you basically
very selfish and cruel?

1063
01:03:01,728 --> 01:03:04,290
Or did I do something
wrong in your case?

1064
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:05,663
Tell me, Arjun.

1065
01:03:05,743 --> 01:03:07,469
I've been with you ever
since we were little kids.

1066
01:03:07,549 --> 01:03:09,588
I celebrated your successes.

1067
01:03:09,668 --> 01:03:11,609
I felt bad for you when you failed.

1068
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:14,961
Just one word from you.

1069
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:17,231
If you had told me
that I'm in your way and

1070
01:03:17,311 --> 01:03:22,031
asked me to move, I would
have left everything for you.

1071
01:03:23,826 --> 01:03:25,112
Why did you betray me?

1072
01:03:29,176 --> 01:03:30,802
Why didn't you tell the
truth to everyone if you knew it?

1073
01:03:31,053 --> 01:03:32,143
Why did you marry me?

1074
01:03:33,328 --> 01:03:36,199
Arjun! I thought everything through.

1075
01:03:36,485 --> 01:03:39,754
If I expose you,
everyone will scold me

1076
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:41,346
and uncle will hit you at the most.

1077
01:03:41,536 --> 01:03:43,560
But it wouldn't have
stopped my wedding.

1078
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,405
It wouldn't have fulfilled
my wish of continuing studying.

1079
01:03:47,105 --> 01:03:50,703
But now I can go to Dubai with you.

1080
01:03:51,239 --> 01:03:54,266
You staged this drama
for a college seat

1081
01:03:54,421 --> 01:03:56,757
and now I can study in
the same college with you.

1082
01:03:57,302 --> 01:03:58,313
How is that possible?

1083
01:03:58,393 --> 01:04:02,430
Why not? It is possible.
You have to make it possible.

1084
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,895
Anu, please try to understand.
It's not possible.

1085
01:04:04,975 --> 01:04:06,270
I'll drop out if you want.
You go ahead.

1086
01:04:07,013 --> 01:04:09,781
You have to come with
me and study with me.

1087
01:04:09,936 --> 01:04:11,156
This is an order.

1088
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:14,183
Nobody knows how cunning you are.

1089
01:04:14,263 --> 01:04:15,575
Should I tell them?
- No, please.

1090
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:19,294
They will trample
you like a doormat.

1091
01:04:20,919 --> 01:04:24,716
How dare you try
to snatch what I want?

1092
01:04:26,083 --> 01:04:29,612
Now you are trapped, dear husband.

1093
01:04:31,376 --> 01:04:35,484
I'll put a tight leash
on your freedom and control it.

1094
01:04:36,954 --> 01:04:38,926
Go. Sleep in that corner.

1095
01:04:40,708 --> 01:04:41,806
On the floor.

1096
01:04:43,795 --> 01:04:46,079
Blackmailing is so much fun.

1097
01:04:48,491 --> 01:04:50,022
Actually she has a point, man.

1098
01:04:52,703 --> 01:04:53,827
If you drop out now

1099
01:04:53,907 --> 01:04:56,067
will your parents agree
to send her alone to study?

1100
01:04:56,147 --> 01:04:58,171
So she laid a condition
that you've to accompany her.

1101
01:04:58,251 --> 01:05:00,039
Actually,
he wouldn't be in this situation

1102
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:02,281
if you hadn't brayed
like a donkey that day.

1103
01:05:07,906 --> 01:05:10,002
Are you happy now?
Now tell him what to do next.

1104
01:05:10,376 --> 01:05:11,449
What can we do?

1105
01:05:11,529 --> 01:05:14,804
We'll beg my brother-in-law
to get rid of that other candidate.

1106
01:05:15,593 --> 01:05:17,489
No.
- Just try asking him...

1107
01:05:17,569 --> 01:05:18,963
He won't agree.
- What if we beg him?

1108
01:05:19,183 --> 01:05:21,577
He won't give in.
You don't know him.

1109
01:05:21,657 --> 01:05:26,247
He's very superstitious and finicky.
He's very sentimental too.

1110
01:05:27,176 --> 01:05:29,383
He consulted 'Vastu'
science to choose the country

1111
01:05:29,463 --> 01:05:30,940
and numerology to
choose the university.

1112
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:32,857
It's very difficult to convince him.

1113
01:05:38,191 --> 01:05:40,004
We reached the office.
- I know.

1114
01:05:41,596 --> 01:05:42,475
Then get down.

1115
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:45,187
Wait a few seconds until
the inauspicious time passes.

1116
01:05:45,761 --> 01:05:47,948
Twenty four, twenty five...
Thank you.

1117
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:53,746
Success will be mine.

1118
01:05:56,063 --> 01:05:57,308
Subject has arrived.

1119
01:05:58,498 --> 01:06:00,581
God, please bless me with success.

1120
01:06:08,992 --> 01:06:10,203
That's a bad omen.

1121
01:06:11,284 --> 01:06:12,750
Why did the black
cat bark like a dog?

1122
01:06:13,034 --> 01:06:14,459
Why did you bring a dog?

1123
01:06:15,034 --> 01:06:16,528
I didn't find a cat. It's okay.

1124
01:06:16,756 --> 01:06:19,365
What do I do now?
Thank God, there is a God.

1125
01:06:21,530 --> 01:06:24,235
God, a black cat barked
like a dog and crossed my path.

1126
01:06:24,315 --> 01:06:25,924
Please protect me from harm.

1127
01:06:26,118 --> 01:06:27,260
Please protect me.

1128
01:06:30,505 --> 01:06:32,048
What is going on?

1129
01:06:33,224 --> 01:06:34,352
Yeah, tell me.

1130
01:06:34,656 --> 01:06:36,457
I had applied for admission
in Turino college.

1131
01:06:36,537 --> 01:06:37,694
I'm here to get an update on it.

1132
01:06:37,774 --> 01:06:38,619
Which college did you say?

1133
01:06:38,699 --> 01:06:39,550
Turino.

1134
01:06:40,616 --> 01:06:41,501
Tu...
- Tu...

1135
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:43,397
Tu...
- Tu...

1136
01:06:44,844 --> 01:06:47,383
No!
- Sister! Sister!

1137
01:06:47,463 --> 01:06:49,320
Good acting.
- Thank you.

1138
01:06:49,742 --> 01:06:51,596
What did you do?
Why is she running away?

1139
01:06:51,748 --> 01:06:54,170
What did I do? I just told
her that I applied for admission

1140
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:55,927
in Turino college and
came to get an update.

1141
01:06:56,135 --> 01:06:58,128
Tu...
- Tu...

1142
01:06:58,543 --> 01:07:00,460
Don't run away. I'm already scared.

1143
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:02,072
Yanam! Please come here.
- Yeah?

1144
01:07:02,839 --> 01:07:04,327
Meet Mr?
- I'm Adavi Shankara Shastri.

1145
01:07:04,407 --> 01:07:05,697
M.Tech IIT. Second topper.

1146
01:07:05,777 --> 01:07:07,683
He wants to join the Turino
college that you studied in.

1147
01:07:07,763 --> 01:07:08,903
Oh, nice. Congrats.

1148
01:07:09,352 --> 01:07:10,179
Don't be silly.

1149
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:11,489
I'm going to join a new college and
you are giving me your left hand

1150
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:12,474
instead of right hand.

1151
01:07:12,554 --> 01:07:14,545
I don't have my right hand.
- Is that a prank?

1152
01:07:16,566 --> 01:07:17,514
You really don't have a hand.

1153
01:07:17,594 --> 01:07:19,693
One student of that college
brought a gun with him

1154
01:07:19,773 --> 01:07:21,679
to test if it will go off or not.

1155
01:07:21,759 --> 01:07:24,363
It did. Twenty students
died and I lost my hand.

1156
01:07:25,809 --> 01:07:26,965
Welcome to the Public
News for the public.

1157
01:07:27,045 --> 01:07:29,995
Then...
- And I'm Aravind Poswami.

1158
01:07:30,075 --> 01:07:31,324
Today's Breaking News.

1159
01:07:31,404 --> 01:07:33,794
In a fresh shooting at
Turino School of Management...

1160
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:34,942
It's our college.

1161
01:07:35,022 --> 01:07:37,281
...twenty Indian students
have lost their lives.

1162
01:07:37,689 --> 01:07:40,132
It is very sad that all
the dead students are Indians.

1163
01:07:40,712 --> 01:07:42,913
Let's see the photos
of the dead students.

1164
01:07:43,051 --> 01:07:45,009
I asked him to say it
twice to make a greater impact.

1165
01:07:48,781 --> 01:07:51,507
Why do all these photos
look like my photos?

1166
01:07:51,645 --> 01:07:52,939
What rubbish? See carefully.

1167
01:07:53,019 --> 01:07:54,233
Let me rub my eyes.

1168
01:07:55,291 --> 01:07:58,432
Let's see the photos of
the dead students once again.

1169
01:07:58,646 --> 01:07:59,691
Let's see.

1170
01:08:01,862 --> 01:08:03,964
Why did all the photos
look like my photos before?

1171
01:08:05,512 --> 01:08:08,453
Nature gives us a
warning before a tragedy

1172
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:09,594
so that we can be careful.

1173
01:08:10,122 --> 01:08:12,180
You are right, brother.
The same happened to me.

1174
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:14,004
Before I joined this college,
a black cat crossed my path

1175
01:08:14,084 --> 01:08:16,123
but I ignored it,
and ended up losing my hand.

1176
01:08:16,203 --> 01:08:17,187
Oh no!

1177
01:08:17,267 --> 01:08:19,116
He lost his hand because
a cat crossed his path.

1178
01:08:19,299 --> 01:08:21,581
But for me, a cat crossed my path,
the lamp went off

1179
01:08:21,661 --> 01:08:23,397
and then a girl shrieked
at the top of her voice.

1180
01:08:23,605 --> 01:08:26,805
No, sir. It's not just a bad omen.
It's a confirmed disaster.

1181
01:08:26,885 --> 01:08:29,028
Sorry to say,
but I don't want an admission

1182
01:08:29,108 --> 01:08:31,761
in this Turino college.
I don't want an admission.

1183
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:33,188
'What did you do to him?'

1184
01:08:33,802 --> 01:08:35,402
Why are you sending silent signals?
Tell him!

1185
01:08:35,482 --> 01:08:36,639
He doesn't want it.
- I don't want it.

1186
01:08:37,712 --> 01:08:40,263
Okay. Select a college
from this list.

1187
01:08:40,566 --> 01:08:44,804
Sir, I've noticed that
you are full of positive vibes.

1188
01:08:44,959 --> 01:08:46,819
Please select a good college for me.

1189
01:08:46,899 --> 01:08:50,002
Okay. Inky pinky donkey.

1190
01:08:51,923 --> 01:08:55,270
Kufli.
Wow, my favorite sweet is 'Kulfi'.

1191
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:58,531
Kufli sounds same as 'Kulfi'.
Good vibes are already on.

1192
01:08:58,611 --> 01:09:00,191
I accept Kufli.

1193
01:09:02,318 --> 01:09:03,642
Congrats, bro.
- Thank you.

1194
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:05,363
Congrats, bro.
- Thank you.

1195
01:09:05,778 --> 01:09:06,850
Thank you!

1196
01:09:09,237 --> 01:09:10,672
Congrats. Congrats.

1197
01:09:10,752 --> 01:09:12,506
I think I signed at
a very auspicious moment.

1198
01:09:12,586 --> 01:09:15,196
Even his left hand feels
like right hand to me.

1199
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,327
Sir, the whole credit goes to you.
Thank you.

1200
01:09:18,407 --> 01:09:19,692
Thank God! Did he sign it?

1201
01:09:19,772 --> 01:09:21,102
Yes, I did.
- Yes, he did.

1202
01:09:22,477 --> 01:09:23,852
Your face looks very familiar.

1203
01:09:23,932 --> 01:09:25,755
Not a chance.
I don't have a goatee or a suit.

1204
01:09:25,835 --> 01:09:28,592
Yes, he had a goatee but you don't.
I'm silly.

1205
01:09:29,384 --> 01:09:32,260
We want a treat. We want a treat.

1206
01:09:32,607 --> 01:09:35,020
Sure. I'll be every grateful to you.

1207
01:09:36,811 --> 01:09:39,587
You came at the last
minute and saved my life.

1208
01:09:42,744 --> 01:09:45,002
You've literally
transformed me into...

1209
01:09:48,485 --> 01:09:49,421
Bye, man.
- Bye, man.

1210
01:09:49,501 --> 01:09:53,441
Take care! Ask Anu if
you need money. Follow Anu.

1211
01:09:53,628 --> 01:09:54,873
Take care of him, my dear.

1212
01:10:06,125 --> 01:10:07,837
Sis! Where will we get a cab?
- I want to go to the washroom, mom.

1213
01:10:07,917 --> 01:10:09,282
Why do we need a cab?
Your brother-in-law is here.

1214
01:10:09,362 --> 01:10:10,518
Brother-in-law?
- Yes.

1215
01:10:10,804 --> 01:10:12,568
Did you tell him that I'm with you?
- Yes, I told him.

1216
01:10:12,724 --> 01:10:14,255
And he still agreed to come?
- Yes.

1217
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:16,383
Welcome to Dubai, brother-in-law!

1218
01:10:17,188 --> 01:10:18,692
Hi, dad.
- Yes, I'm welcoming you.

1219
01:10:18,926 --> 01:10:20,431
Hello, dear. Welcome to Dubai.
- Hi, brother.

1220
01:10:20,511 --> 01:10:21,823
I saw you when you
were a little girl.

1221
01:10:21,903 --> 01:10:24,210
Are you really talking to me?
- Yeah.

1222
01:10:24,418 --> 01:10:26,243
Are you not angry with me?
- Not at all.

1223
01:10:26,323 --> 01:10:27,315
How?

1224
01:10:27,599 --> 01:10:29,225
Because you were forced
into an unwanted marriage.

1225
01:10:30,298 --> 01:10:31,171
Just kidding.

1226
01:10:31,251 --> 01:10:33,221
Actually I have a small doubt.
- Ask me.

1227
01:10:33,301 --> 01:10:34,881
What's the problem between you two?

1228
01:10:35,418 --> 01:10:37,744
It's a sad love story.

1229
01:10:59,737 --> 01:11:01,286
Come here, boy.

1230
01:11:01,612 --> 01:11:04,463
Give this letter to the
girl in the brown dress. Go.

1231
01:11:08,885 --> 01:11:09,860
Did you call me, dad?

1232
01:11:13,324 --> 01:11:14,293
Who are you?

1233
01:11:18,845 --> 01:11:21,267
'I told him to give the letter
to the girl in the brown dress'

1234
01:11:21,488 --> 01:11:24,650
'but he gave it to his
sister who was in a brown dress.'

1235
01:11:24,934 --> 01:11:25,778
Dad!

1236
01:11:26,228 --> 01:11:29,252
'So, this rascal put
a twist in my love story.'

1237
01:11:29,332 --> 01:11:30,361
That's the fight between us.

1238
01:11:32,081 --> 01:11:33,387
Come in, Arjun.

1239
01:11:34,733 --> 01:11:36,409
This is your new home.

1240
01:11:36,646 --> 01:11:39,089
This is the master bedroom.
That's the second bedroom.

1241
01:11:39,273 --> 01:11:40,668
And right there
is the guest bedroom.

1242
01:11:40,863 --> 01:11:42,527
We bought everything you'll need.

1243
01:11:42,607 --> 01:11:45,316
Call me if you need anything.
Don't go out alone at night.

1244
01:11:45,472 --> 01:11:46,674
It's a very risky area.

1245
01:11:46,754 --> 01:11:48,456
Bye, Anu. Bye, Arjun.
- Okay, guys. Sleep tight.

1246
01:11:48,536 --> 01:11:49,523
Take good rest. Okay?

1247
01:11:49,603 --> 01:11:51,453
Bye.
- Bye. See you.

1248
01:11:56,796 --> 01:11:57,820
Which room do you want?

1249
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:00,761
Which room do you want?

1250
01:12:01,085 --> 01:12:02,331
Master bedroom... I want that one.

1251
01:12:02,981 --> 01:12:04,254
Then I want that one.

1252
01:12:13,397 --> 01:12:14,378
What?

1253
01:12:29,751 --> 01:12:31,628
Where's the food?
- I ate it.

1254
01:12:32,043 --> 01:12:32,926
What about me?

1255
01:12:34,067 --> 01:12:35,918
Wash the dishes. I'll cook for you.

1256
01:12:36,377 --> 01:12:39,473
What? You want me to
wash the dishes you dirtied?

1257
01:12:39,638 --> 01:12:42,120
No way. Give me money.
I'll eat something outside.

1258
01:12:45,398 --> 01:12:47,352
What's the time?
- It's 9:35 pm.

1259
01:12:48,563 --> 01:12:51,149
'Don't go out alone at night.
It's a very risky area.'

1260
01:12:51,572 --> 01:12:54,651
Will you go? Go ahead.
They will shoot you on the road.

1261
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:11,152
This is not Hyderabad
and I'm not your maid.

1262
01:13:11,518 --> 01:13:12,833
So, don't give orders to me.

1263
01:13:13,594 --> 01:13:15,698
If you want me to cook food,
you've to do the dishes.

1264
01:13:15,884 --> 01:13:16,949
If you want me to clean the house

1265
01:13:17,029 --> 01:13:18,499
you've to wash the
clothes and iron them.

1266
01:13:18,579 --> 01:13:20,499
Me?
- Yes, you.

1267
01:13:21,633 --> 01:13:23,771
You brought me here even
though you don't like it.

1268
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,599
So, you've to share the
work even if it's difficult.

1269
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:36,774
Get in.

1270
01:13:38,365 --> 01:13:39,361
No.

1271
01:13:40,371 --> 01:13:43,338
Taxi.
- Alright. Let's play a game.

1272
01:13:43,796 --> 01:13:44,903
What game?

1273
01:13:45,276 --> 01:13:47,526
Whoever reaches the college first

1274
01:13:47,606 --> 01:13:50,261
won't have to do any
chores for one month.

1275
01:13:50,341 --> 01:13:53,159
What's this?
You are acting like a kid.

1276
01:13:54,684 --> 01:13:57,495
Okay, I'll play the game
since you've asked. Bye.

1277
01:13:57,689 --> 01:14:00,270
Hey, wait! Arjun!
- Arjun! Cheater!

1278
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:02,052
Loser! Loser!

1279
01:14:13,328 --> 01:14:14,591
Bye.

1280
01:15:07,634 --> 01:15:09,978
I'm Rashid Ansari.

1281
01:15:10,058 --> 01:15:13,342
For the next one year I'm gonna be
teaching you marketing and research.

1282
01:15:13,506 --> 01:15:15,556
Let's see who all we've here.

1283
01:15:16,195 --> 01:15:18,055
Anupama Kakarlamudi.

1284
01:15:18,135 --> 01:15:19,577
Arjun Kakarlamudi.

1285
01:15:19,733 --> 01:15:21,108
Are you guys related somehow?

1286
01:15:21,188 --> 01:15:22,475
No. No.

1287
01:16:11,998 --> 01:16:14,447
I need your assignment by Monday.

1288
01:16:14,527 --> 01:16:17,049
Arjun! Is the assignment
too difficult?

1289
01:16:18,114 --> 01:16:19,996
Do you want me to help?
- Will you?

1290
01:16:21,518 --> 01:16:22,625
But you've to do something first.

1291
01:16:22,705 --> 01:16:23,552
What?

1292
01:16:26,804 --> 01:16:28,852
Your assignment. What is that?

1293
01:16:30,561 --> 01:16:33,086
The steamed cakes
you ate with chutney.

1294
01:16:59,902 --> 01:17:02,453
I did the dishes. I washed
the clothes and ironed them.

1295
01:17:02,903 --> 01:17:04,771
I cleaned the floor too.
- What do you want?

1296
01:17:04,851 --> 01:17:06,406
Please do this assignment.

1297
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:09,607
Ask your new friend to do it.

1298
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:44,643
Why is the quantity so less?
- My boss is a miserly idiot.

1299
01:17:44,723 --> 01:17:46,827
Hey, you speak Telugu?
- Yes, sir.

1300
01:17:47,433 --> 01:17:48,492
'What is he doing here?'

1301
01:17:49,597 --> 01:17:52,269
Sir? Arjun sir!

1302
01:17:52,727 --> 01:17:53,843
You are Arjun sir, right?

1303
01:17:54,863 --> 01:17:57,423
You are...
- I'm Adavi...

1304
01:17:57,503 --> 01:18:00,182
Adavi Shesh?
- Not Adavi Shesh.

1305
01:18:00,338 --> 01:18:01,929
Adavi Shankara Shastri.

1306
01:18:02,241 --> 01:18:03,797
How can you forget me so soon?

1307
01:18:03,877 --> 01:18:05,389
We met in the consultancy agency.

1308
01:18:05,469 --> 01:18:06,816
I was going to join
the Turino college

1309
01:18:06,896 --> 01:18:08,996
but you told me not
to and saved my life.

1310
01:18:09,161 --> 01:18:10,674
I'll be forever
grateful to you, sir.

1311
01:18:10,754 --> 01:18:12,274
How can you forget?
- Yeah. Let's not get into that now.

1312
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:15,738
How are you?
- Not good.

1313
01:18:15,954 --> 01:18:19,273
You told me to forget
Turino and join Kufli college.

1314
01:18:19,353 --> 01:18:21,663
After coming here I found
out that it's a phony college.

1315
01:18:21,743 --> 01:18:24,690
The police came and told
us to go back to our countries.

1316
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:27,312
When I said no,
they beat me up with petrol cans.

1317
01:18:27,392 --> 01:18:29,539
When I fell at their
feet and begged them

1318
01:18:29,619 --> 01:18:30,959
they said they will allow
me to try to get admission

1319
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:32,731
in a different college
before my student visa ends.

1320
01:18:32,868 --> 01:18:35,120
They tied a monitor to
my leg so that I don't run away

1321
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:36,648
and settle down as
an illegal resident.

1322
01:18:36,728 --> 01:18:38,031
Crazy technology, right?

1323
01:18:38,111 --> 01:18:39,743
It's too good.
It never loses signals.

1324
01:18:39,823 --> 01:18:41,846
It's okay.
- What is okay, sir?

1325
01:18:41,991 --> 01:18:43,327
I'm in a very bad state.

1326
01:18:43,407 --> 01:18:45,499
I don't have a place
to live and food to eat.

1327
01:18:45,579 --> 01:18:47,367
My boss makes me work like a donkey

1328
01:18:47,447 --> 01:18:49,353
and asks me to sleep
in the basement with the mice.

1329
01:18:49,433 --> 01:18:51,789
Anyway, enough of my story.
What are you doing here?

1330
01:18:54,335 --> 01:18:56,315
Sightseeing.
- Sightseeing?

1331
01:18:56,395 --> 01:18:58,062
Sightseeing.
- There are no great sights here.

1332
01:18:58,142 --> 01:19:00,302
He came to study MBA.
- MBA?

1333
01:19:00,509 --> 01:19:01,628
Why did you say you
came for sightseeing?

1334
01:19:01,708 --> 01:19:03,398
You are so secretive. Which college?

1335
01:19:03,870 --> 01:19:06,154
Actually,
it's very difficult to pronounce.

1336
01:19:06,234 --> 01:19:07,676
It's okay. Try it.

1337
01:19:09,129 --> 01:19:10,720
Turino College of Management.

1338
01:19:11,357 --> 01:19:12,492
Turino College?

1339
01:19:13,425 --> 01:19:15,473
Why did you decide
to join that college

1340
01:19:15,553 --> 01:19:17,417
after you saved my life
by warning me about it?

1341
01:19:17,497 --> 01:19:19,508
Who will be responsible
for your parents if you die?

1342
01:19:19,708 --> 01:19:22,663
You fool! Don't you get it?
- Who are you?

1343
01:19:22,743 --> 01:19:23,853
Idiot!

1344
01:19:24,067 --> 01:19:26,662
[Gibberish]

1345
01:19:35,971 --> 01:19:37,949
Please, bro. Don't attack me.
- Where will you go?

1346
01:19:38,029 --> 01:19:39,347
Good morning, officer.

1347
01:19:39,659 --> 01:19:40,510
Bro...

1348
01:19:40,986 --> 01:19:43,664
You deserve to be killed.
- What will you get by killing me?

1349
01:19:43,744 --> 01:19:44,730
Satisfaction.

1350
01:19:44,810 --> 01:19:47,262
Give me one chance.
I'll get you a seat in our college.

1351
01:19:47,408 --> 01:19:48,245
How?

1352
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:49,283
Thank God!

1353
01:19:50,051 --> 01:19:52,459
There's a party in our college
in two days. I'll do it then.

1354
01:19:52,539 --> 01:19:53,746
Do you want me to sleep
with the mice until then?

1355
01:19:53,826 --> 01:19:54,753
Each one is so fat.

1356
01:20:03,328 --> 01:20:05,203
He'll be here for a few days.

1357
01:20:05,637 --> 01:20:08,372
Come in. Did he trap you?

1358
01:20:08,583 --> 01:20:10,891
He's a charmer.
Everyone believes him.

1359
01:20:11,455 --> 01:20:13,912
Okay, your wish.
- Excuse me. I've a doubt.

1360
01:20:14,532 --> 01:20:16,670
Tell me.
- After I found out the truth

1361
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:18,801
I was so enraged that
I was almost ready to kill him.

1362
01:20:19,001 --> 01:20:22,067
Aren't you upset about what he
did to you? Just out of curiosity.

1363
01:20:23,024 --> 01:20:24,403
He'll die only once if I kill him.

1364
01:20:24,483 --> 01:20:27,453
Of course.
- That's why I married him.

1365
01:20:32,464 --> 01:20:34,066
According to the 'Vastu' science

1366
01:20:34,146 --> 01:20:35,684
I'm guessing this
is the guestroom, right?

1367
01:20:41,993 --> 01:20:44,047
Superb! Wow, what a joke, madam!

1368
01:20:44,127 --> 01:20:45,181
It's nice, no?

1369
01:20:45,261 --> 01:20:46,538
Your joke was okay.

1370
01:20:46,618 --> 01:20:48,588
But her joke was so bad that
she should be drowned in the water.

1371
01:20:48,668 --> 01:20:50,431
She's the one who's
going to give you a seat.

1372
01:20:51,391 --> 01:20:54,409
What a joke, madam! My laughter
is coming from somewhere else.

1373
01:20:54,962 --> 01:20:57,254
Enjoy your drink. Enjoy the party.

1374
01:20:57,334 --> 01:20:58,672
Yeah, sure.
- Thank you. Bye.

1375
01:20:58,752 --> 01:21:00,229
Thank you. You are too funny.

1376
01:21:01,876 --> 01:21:03,592
You look gorgeous tonight.

1377
01:21:05,149 --> 01:21:07,474
He looks like some Afghani bouncer
who's guarding a Pakistani bowler

1378
01:21:07,554 --> 01:21:08,406
and he has a fan following

1379
01:21:08,486 --> 01:21:10,087
as if he's a professors
who will give us good grades.

1380
01:21:10,167 --> 01:21:11,049
Yes, he is.

1381
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:14,142
Present, sir.

1382
01:21:15,681 --> 01:21:16,504
Yeah.

1383
01:21:16,584 --> 01:21:18,086
Hey, Arjun. You want to dance?
- Yeah.

1384
01:21:18,166 --> 01:21:21,443
Actually, I cannot dance.
If I do, I get sweaty and tense.

1385
01:21:23,470 --> 01:21:24,693
Of course, sure.

1386
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:27,367
Sir! She's looking.

1387
01:21:28,756 --> 01:21:30,046
Do you know how to do assignments?

1388
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,741
I'm fairly good.
Then I'll go dancing.

1389
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:44,429
Excuse me. I'll be back in a minute.

1390
01:21:45,821 --> 01:21:46,914
Hey, want to dance?

1391
01:21:49,765 --> 01:21:51,538
Come on. Just one dance.

1392
01:22:14,874 --> 01:22:17,155
Idiot. What the heck are you doing?

1393
01:22:17,235 --> 01:22:19,912
It's okay. What's wrong with you?
- Just leave me.

1394
01:22:23,577 --> 01:22:24,972
Arjun, let's go.
- Get lost.

1395
01:22:25,191 --> 01:22:26,498
Arjun, let's go.

1396
01:22:26,578 --> 01:22:28,190
Hey, back off. He's with me.

1397
01:22:28,270 --> 01:22:30,666
He's my husband.
- Is it true?

1398
01:22:30,874 --> 01:22:32,031
I can explain.
- You cheat.

1399
01:22:32,111 --> 01:22:34,072
Simran!
- You've danced enough.

1400
01:22:34,426 --> 01:22:36,037
Anu! What are you doing?

1401
01:22:36,523 --> 01:22:37,593
Excuse me, sir.

1402
01:22:44,036 --> 01:22:44,839
Anu!

1403
01:22:49,576 --> 01:22:51,627
She was just joking, sir. That's it.
- How dare you!

1404
01:22:51,707 --> 01:22:54,055
She's a small kid. Don't hit her.
- Shastri! Go into your room!

1405
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:57,150
She's a small kid.
You are very angry. Please, sir.

1406
01:22:58,337 --> 01:22:59,963
He scared Shastri.

1407
01:23:00,043 --> 01:23:01,154
What's your problem?

1408
01:23:02,701 --> 01:23:05,348
What?
- What? I'll break your jaw!

1409
01:23:05,599 --> 01:23:06,637
You never let me be happy at home.

1410
01:23:06,717 --> 01:23:07,730
Will you make me
miserable outside too?

1411
01:23:07,979 --> 01:23:09,958
I just wanted to come
home so I called you.

1412
01:23:10,038 --> 01:23:11,993
She shouted at me and I got angry.

1413
01:23:12,073 --> 01:23:13,856
It didn't look like that.
You disturbed us on purpose

1414
01:23:13,936 --> 01:23:15,667
because you were jealous
that I was dancing with her.

1415
01:23:15,747 --> 01:23:17,876
Really? Do you think
you are Hrithik Roshan?

1416
01:23:18,305 --> 01:23:21,301
Weren't you jealous when
I was dancing with Rashid?

1417
01:23:21,612 --> 01:23:22,802
Do you think I didn't notice?

1418
01:23:24,456 --> 01:23:25,777
He's a tasteless idiot.

1419
01:23:25,857 --> 01:23:27,971
Why would I be jealous
if you dance with him?

1420
01:23:30,019 --> 01:23:32,814
Go dance with him. Go slee...

1421
01:23:36,944 --> 01:23:37,920
What did you say?

1422
01:23:38,729 --> 01:23:40,659
Nothing.
- What did you say?

1423
01:23:40,832 --> 01:23:41,814
Nothing.

1424
01:23:42,146 --> 01:23:44,236
What were you going to say?
- Not your shoe.

1425
01:23:44,745 --> 01:23:46,389
How dare you throw a shoe at me?

1426
01:23:47,643 --> 01:23:48,603
You!

1427
01:23:53,592 --> 01:23:55,760
Will you say anything
that comes to your mind?

1428
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:58,074
Anu, stop it!

1429
01:23:58,945 --> 01:24:00,104
You!

1430
01:24:00,502 --> 01:24:02,353
You are getting out of control!

1431
01:24:38,385 --> 01:24:39,682
How dare you hit me?

1432
01:24:40,467 --> 01:24:41,773
Anu! Let me go!

1433
01:24:43,234 --> 01:24:44,540
Anu!

1434
01:26:46,858 --> 01:26:48,453
Oh no!

1435
01:26:50,007 --> 01:26:51,488
Oh no!

1436
01:26:54,504 --> 01:26:57,347
Oh no! It is torn.

1437
01:27:09,308 --> 01:27:10,493
Sir?

1438
01:27:10,715 --> 01:27:12,237
I'm glad you finally woke up.

1439
01:27:12,317 --> 01:27:14,571
Oh dear! What were
those sounds last night?

1440
01:27:14,651 --> 01:27:16,141
I was so scared.
I wanted to come into your room.

1441
01:27:16,405 --> 01:27:17,927
How could I come
when my door was locked?

1442
01:27:18,163 --> 01:27:20,647
I heard the sounds of
glass breaking and screaming.

1443
01:27:20,727 --> 01:27:22,480
I thought you definitely killed her.

1444
01:27:22,633 --> 01:27:24,902
I finally sighed in relief
after seeing her this morning.

1445
01:27:24,982 --> 01:27:27,372
Thank God! I was so...
- Breakfast?

1446
01:27:27,614 --> 01:27:28,832
Anu made it.

1447
01:27:29,448 --> 01:27:30,783
Those dishes?
- She washed them.

1448
01:27:31,952 --> 01:27:33,945
Those clothes?
- She did the washing and ironing.

1449
01:27:34,187 --> 01:27:36,525
I think you scared
her too much last night.

1450
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:39,625
You look quiet but you are
very strong. You are a Burger King.

1451
01:27:39,705 --> 01:27:41,368
If you give her another
dose like last night

1452
01:27:41,448 --> 01:27:43,105
she will be tamed for life.

1453
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:46,828
My I come in?

1454
01:28:07,542 --> 01:28:10,698
Why are you so shy? It's just Arjun.

1455
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:12,806
Ever since that day...

1456
01:28:15,483 --> 01:28:17,663
Mr. Rashid? What...
- It's okay. No need to panic.

1457
01:28:17,905 --> 01:28:19,514
My restroom is under maintenance.

1458
01:28:21,588 --> 01:28:24,193
So? You and your husband
are having problems?

1459
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:27,944
Everyone has problems
and everyone has needs.

1460
01:28:28,322 --> 01:28:32,030
You have yours and I have mine.
- Don't touch.

1461
01:28:32,278 --> 01:28:33,738
What's up with you, dude?

1462
01:28:33,818 --> 01:28:35,651
The other day you
were dancing with me and

1463
01:28:35,731 --> 01:28:36,937
today you are acting so pricey.

1464
01:28:38,321 --> 01:28:42,310
Listen to me. You've no idea
how many ways I can mess you up.

1465
01:28:42,482 --> 01:28:45,207
I can make this
look like your fault.

1466
01:28:45,287 --> 01:28:47,062
So you think about my proposal.

1467
01:28:54,405 --> 01:28:55,390
Anu...

1468
01:28:58,871 --> 01:29:00,168
Anu?

1469
01:29:09,388 --> 01:29:10,928
Come with me.
- Arjun!

1470
01:29:11,609 --> 01:29:12,809
Where are we going?

1471
01:29:13,631 --> 01:29:14,939
Let it go, Arjun. Please.

1472
01:29:15,198 --> 01:29:17,782
It was my mistake. I gave him space.

1473
01:29:17,862 --> 01:29:19,771
I should've danced with him.
Arjun, please...

1474
01:29:40,798 --> 01:29:42,647
What now?
- Tell me.

1475
01:29:44,453 --> 01:29:46,105
You wanna pick up
a fight or something.

1476
01:29:46,555 --> 01:29:47,515
It's okay. Tell me.

1477
01:29:47,957 --> 01:29:49,194
Boss!

1478
01:29:49,496 --> 01:29:51,079
If you wanna be a hero,
go do it somewhere else.

1479
01:29:51,159 --> 01:29:52,558
Your grades and your
marks are in my hands.

1480
01:29:52,638 --> 01:29:54,028
He misbehaved with
me in the washroom.

1481
01:29:56,337 --> 01:29:58,145
I would've beaten him
right there if you had told me.

1482
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:00,903
Guys!

1483
01:30:18,785 --> 01:30:20,160
You used to tell me
everything in Hyderabad.

1484
01:30:27,913 --> 01:30:29,705
I agree that we
are not in good terms.

1485
01:30:31,248 --> 01:30:33,096
But it's not so bad that
you can't tell me such things.

1486
01:30:47,847 --> 01:30:50,643
Are you crazy?
I'll get you deported!

1487
01:30:50,788 --> 01:30:51,736
You rascal!

1488
01:30:53,736 --> 01:30:54,953
It's not wrong to dance with him.

1489
01:30:55,126 --> 01:30:56,945
But it's wrong for him
to take advantage of you.

1490
01:31:03,277 --> 01:31:05,235
Just tell me if
you face any problems.

1491
01:31:33,183 --> 01:31:35,618
'Mom, I want strawberry.'

1492
01:31:35,916 --> 01:31:38,836
'I want it right now. Please, mom.'

1493
01:31:39,111 --> 01:31:40,425
Anu! Ice-cream.

1494
01:31:42,607 --> 01:31:44,639
Why are you behaving so strangely?

1495
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:46,185
Aren't you angry with me anymore?

1496
01:31:46,953 --> 01:31:48,553
How long can anger last, Arjun?

1497
01:31:48,633 --> 01:31:51,034
Just give it some time.
Everything will be fine.

1498
01:31:52,816 --> 01:31:54,798
I've been meaning
to ask you something

1499
01:31:54,878 --> 01:31:56,138
but I don't know if
I can ask you or not...

1500
01:31:56,218 --> 01:31:59,546
Actually,
I wanted to tell you something too.

1501
01:31:59,789 --> 01:32:01,250
Okay, you go first.

1502
01:32:04,191 --> 01:32:05,349
Anu, are you happy?

1503
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:06,734
Very.

1504
01:32:07,823 --> 01:32:09,034
But I'm not.

1505
01:32:10,634 --> 01:32:13,549
I don't like you as
much as you like studying.

1506
01:32:13,748 --> 01:32:15,270
You know that too.

1507
01:32:15,564 --> 01:32:18,954
Frankly, you married
me to exact revenge from me

1508
01:32:19,034 --> 01:32:21,108
but you don't like me.

1509
01:32:22,941 --> 01:32:25,665
It's not right for
us to be like this.

1510
01:32:27,092 --> 01:32:29,211
Just because we had sex

1511
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:35,508
I'm scared to spend
all my life with you.

1512
01:32:37,671 --> 01:32:39,513
Don't be scared, Arjun.

1513
01:32:40,714 --> 01:32:42,306
That night was just an accident.

1514
01:32:43,223 --> 01:32:46,016
We both were drunk and lost control.
That's it.

1515
01:32:46,301 --> 01:32:50,677
And our relationship,
it's just a marriage of convenience.

1516
01:32:52,113 --> 01:32:54,690
I'm using you to
fulfill my ambitions

1517
01:32:54,932 --> 01:32:57,059
and you are enduring
me because you've no choice.

1518
01:32:57,379 --> 01:33:01,946
You don't have to endure
me when I achieve my goal.

1519
01:33:02,967 --> 01:33:07,308
I will divorce you the
minute I finish my education.

1520
01:33:09,566 --> 01:33:11,780
I've been waiting for the
right time to tell you this.

1521
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:13,077
Yes! Yes!

1522
01:33:14,496 --> 01:33:17,281
Thank you, Anu.
Thank you so much. You are an angel.

1523
01:33:17,361 --> 01:33:18,872
You are an angel, Anu.

1524
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:23,949
Thank God! Wait a minute.
What about our families?

1525
01:33:26,743 --> 01:33:28,040
What about our families?

1526
01:33:30,098 --> 01:33:34,414
We'll tell them once we finish
everything. Let's be strong.

1527
01:33:34,604 --> 01:33:37,035
You be strong, Anu.
Nobody can stop us. That's it.

1528
01:33:44,610 --> 01:33:45,933
Why did you throw it?

1529
01:33:46,842 --> 01:33:50,310
I had enough. I got a brain freeze.

1530
01:34:08,192 --> 01:34:09,811
[TV In The Background]

1531
01:34:09,891 --> 01:34:11,021
What a goal!

1532
01:34:11,861 --> 01:34:13,703
Anu, take this.
- Thank you.

1533
01:34:13,783 --> 01:34:15,848
Why are you eating nonstop?
Take a break.

1534
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:18,020
Shut up! This is how
women eat in this condition.

1535
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:20,069
What condition?
- During pregnancy.

1536
01:34:20,346 --> 01:34:21,531
What?

1537
01:34:22,319 --> 01:34:24,066
Congratulations, brother-in-law!

1538
01:34:24,146 --> 01:34:26,020
Congratulations, sir! You did it!

1539
01:34:27,585 --> 01:34:29,808
'But, when did you do it?'

1540
01:34:30,284 --> 01:34:32,438
Sorry. She wanted
to keep it a surprise.

1541
01:34:32,706 --> 01:34:35,413
But I blurted it out by mistake.
Sorry, Anu.

1542
01:34:36,823 --> 01:34:38,207
Anu!
- Where are you going?

1543
01:34:38,287 --> 01:34:39,950
I mean you were always with me.
When did it happen?

1544
01:34:40,030 --> 01:34:41,219
Shastri!

1545
01:34:43,570 --> 01:34:46,024
Anu! Anu, wait.

1546
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:52,322
Anu! Is it true?

1547
01:34:52,752 --> 01:34:53,679
But how?

1548
01:34:55,741 --> 01:34:58,204
I mean, it was just one time...

1549
01:34:58,812 --> 01:35:01,414
Congratulations!
You proved that you are a man.

1550
01:35:04,576 --> 01:35:05,614
Wait, Anu!

1551
01:35:10,412 --> 01:35:12,218
What is this... - Sir, one minute.
I've a small doubt.

1552
01:35:12,298 --> 01:35:14,210
Shastri, go inside.
But just hear me out. One minute.

1553
01:35:14,290 --> 01:35:15,255
Go inside.

1554
01:35:16,839 --> 01:35:17,946
Why didn't you tell me about it?

1555
01:35:19,150 --> 01:35:20,555
Because I didn't feel like it.

1556
01:35:23,032 --> 01:35:24,555
How far are you...

1557
01:35:25,841 --> 01:35:26,679
Six weeks.

1558
01:35:27,502 --> 01:35:28,803
What? Six...

1559
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:33,038
Okay, we'll go to the
doctor tomorrow morning.

1560
01:35:33,501 --> 01:35:34,573
My appointment is
the day after tomorrow.

1561
01:35:34,653 --> 01:35:35,549
Not for that.

1562
01:35:38,413 --> 01:35:39,534
Then for what?

1563
01:35:41,914 --> 01:35:42,910
For what?

1564
01:35:43,602 --> 01:35:44,993
For what, Arjun?
- I don't want this.

1565
01:35:45,644 --> 01:35:46,571
What?

1566
01:35:49,089 --> 01:35:50,003
This.

1567
01:35:52,223 --> 01:35:54,202
How dare you?
- I'm not ready for this.

1568
01:35:54,507 --> 01:35:55,828
What if I'm ready?

1569
01:35:56,036 --> 01:35:57,087
You don't want to abort it?

1570
01:35:57,167 --> 01:35:58,312
I want to keep it.

1571
01:36:16,291 --> 01:36:17,632
You are a sadist.

1572
01:36:18,454 --> 01:36:20,374
You are doing it on purpose.

1573
01:36:20,668 --> 01:36:22,432
You never intended
to give me a divorce.

1574
01:36:22,674 --> 01:36:24,923
You just want to torture
me as long as I live.

1575
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:27,742
What?

1576
01:36:29,947 --> 01:36:30,985
First you trapped
me into marrying you.

1577
01:36:31,065 --> 01:36:32,084
Then you tempted
me and got pregnant.

1578
01:36:32,164 --> 01:36:33,364
And now you want to...

1579
01:36:35,387 --> 01:36:37,221
How cheap of you, Arjun?

1580
01:36:38,043 --> 01:36:40,430
Did you think I'll use
my pregnancy to tie you up?

1581
01:36:41,649 --> 01:36:42,791
Never.

1582
01:36:43,284 --> 01:36:45,109
I said I'll divorce
you and I'll do it.

1583
01:36:46,691 --> 01:36:50,609
I'm responsible for the
baby in my womb. Not you.

1584
01:36:51,482 --> 01:36:53,489
I won't give you a chance
to sign as the father

1585
01:36:53,569 --> 01:36:55,305
at the time of my delivery.

1586
01:37:08,270 --> 01:37:10,899
So, the sounds that
I heard that night

1587
01:37:11,288 --> 01:37:13,156
were not the sounds of a fight?

1588
01:37:14,047 --> 01:37:15,535
Were they sounds
of your love making?

1589
01:37:15,898 --> 01:37:17,723
You idiot!

1590
01:37:25,661 --> 01:37:27,802
Anu!
- Mom, I'm pregnant.

1591
01:37:29,553 --> 01:37:32,655
Anu!
- Anu dear! Congratulations.

1592
01:37:32,735 --> 01:37:34,320
Give the phone to Arjun.

1593
01:37:38,546 --> 01:37:40,484
A FEW MONTHS LATER

1594
01:38:28,882 --> 01:38:30,016
Surprise!

1595
01:38:30,217 --> 01:38:31,061
Anu!

1596
01:38:32,472 --> 01:38:35,666
Anu! How are you, dear?
- Keep everyone's luggage inside.

1597
01:38:37,327 --> 01:38:40,219
Mom! That's Arjun's room.
My room is that side.

1598
01:38:40,966 --> 01:38:42,979
What? Separate rooms?

1599
01:38:45,248 --> 01:38:46,224
Who is he?

1600
01:38:47,341 --> 01:38:48,261
This is mine.

1601
01:38:48,482 --> 01:38:51,610
He's Shastri.
My friend. He lives with us.

1602
01:38:51,854 --> 01:38:53,307
He lives here?

1603
01:38:54,085 --> 01:38:56,766
Okay, I'm going to college.
- What about Anu?

1604
01:38:59,425 --> 01:39:00,495
I'm not well, uncle.

1605
01:39:00,698 --> 01:39:03,154
Oh no. Why didn't you
take her to the doctor?

1606
01:39:05,636 --> 01:39:08,793
No need. I took medicines.
I will be alright.

1607
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:17,882
Shastri!

1608
01:39:17,962 --> 01:39:20,304
Oh, there's chicken.
Did you hide it from me?

1609
01:39:27,248 --> 01:39:30,168
Oh my God!
Aunt Anumapa is eating too much.

1610
01:39:32,246 --> 01:39:33,318
Chintu, shut up!

1611
01:39:33,650 --> 01:39:34,902
Go bring ice-cream.
- Okay.

1612
01:39:34,982 --> 01:39:36,680
You should be quiet
until the ice-cream is here.

1613
01:39:37,248 --> 01:39:38,369
Okay.

1614
01:39:41,026 --> 01:39:43,808
Ice-cream is finished.
- Finished? Who ate it?

1615
01:39:44,057 --> 01:39:46,354
I saw it this morning. It was full.

1616
01:39:48,797 --> 01:39:50,547
I'm sure she ate it.

1617
01:39:50,699 --> 01:39:53,833
She doesn't know what
she eats or how much she eats.

1618
01:39:54,048 --> 01:39:55,134
She eats like a hog.

1619
01:39:56,772 --> 01:39:57,845
Uncle.

1620
01:39:57,925 --> 01:39:59,773
Actually, I ate the ice-cream.

1621
01:39:59,853 --> 01:40:02,437
Chintu! Did you finish
half a kilo ice-cream?

1622
01:40:04,643 --> 01:40:05,612
Anu!

1623
01:40:05,862 --> 01:40:07,661
How dare you!
- Shut up!

1624
01:40:09,823 --> 01:40:11,587
Women have food cravings
during pregnancy.

1625
01:40:11,838 --> 01:40:13,626
If he doesn't know,
there are three women at home

1626
01:40:13,706 --> 01:40:14,933
that he can talk to and find out.

1627
01:40:15,013 --> 01:40:17,184
He's always criticizing
me about my food.

1628
01:40:19,802 --> 01:40:22,197
Arjun... - Take Chintu to
sleep in Shastri's room.

1629
01:40:22,396 --> 01:40:23,667
Come with me.

1630
01:40:25,761 --> 01:40:27,214
Come on, let's go.

1631
01:40:37,650 --> 01:40:39,684
Cheers! Don't tell mom.

1632
01:40:40,854 --> 01:40:41,698
Why?

1633
01:40:41,778 --> 01:40:43,719
After I got diabetes,
I told her that I quit alcohol.

1634
01:40:45,531 --> 01:40:46,479
What's so funny?

1635
01:40:46,559 --> 01:40:48,548
Why are you scared of
mom after all these years?

1636
01:40:48,770 --> 01:40:50,236
I'm not scared.
I'm just being careful.

1637
01:40:50,316 --> 01:40:51,883
And because I'm so careful

1638
01:40:52,083 --> 01:40:54,650
no woman has thrown
water on my face yet.

1639
01:40:54,788 --> 01:40:56,151
So, you brought me
here to tell me this?

1640
01:40:56,297 --> 01:40:57,833
You've said your piece.
Shall we go home now?

1641
01:40:58,261 --> 01:40:59,631
No. Wait...

1642
01:41:00,157 --> 01:41:01,652
Arjun, wait.

1643
01:41:02,018 --> 01:41:03,519
So, what's new?

1644
01:41:03,976 --> 01:41:05,027
Nothing.

1645
01:41:05,470 --> 01:41:06,460
Nothing?

1646
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:08,072
What's your problem?

1647
01:41:08,577 --> 01:41:10,860
You forcefully got me married
to her and now I'm suffering.

1648
01:41:11,123 --> 01:41:12,362
This is our problem.

1649
01:41:13,185 --> 01:41:14,486
So, you don't interfere in it.

1650
01:41:16,735 --> 01:41:19,517
If you fight inside your room,
it will remain your problem.

1651
01:41:19,911 --> 01:41:22,990
But if you fight in the living room
it becomes a family problem.

1652
01:41:23,466 --> 01:41:25,016
We will interfere.

1653
01:41:26,677 --> 01:41:28,974
What does Anu lack?
- I don't like her.

1654
01:41:29,054 --> 01:41:31,977
But why?
- Why? How should I explain?

1655
01:41:32,696 --> 01:41:34,433
Alright, dad.
You don't like to eat fish.

1656
01:41:34,513 --> 01:41:35,671
If someone says it's good
for your heart,

1657
01:41:35,751 --> 01:41:37,270
will you eat it?
It's the same.

1658
01:41:37,350 --> 01:41:39,048
Yes, I don't like to each fish,
so I don't touch it.

1659
01:41:39,128 --> 01:41:41,454
How did your fish get pregnant
if you didn't touch it? - Dad!

1660
01:41:42,488 --> 01:41:44,882
It's not wrong for
a couple to fight.

1661
01:41:45,601 --> 01:41:49,226
But after the fight
they should come closer.

1662
01:41:49,306 --> 01:41:51,855
They shouldn't drift apart
and start sleeping separately.

1663
01:41:52,036 --> 01:41:53,911
I'm not ready for the baby, dad.

1664
01:41:54,589 --> 01:41:55,952
That's not your call, Arjun.

1665
01:41:56,269 --> 01:41:58,878
Only women can decide
if they want the baby or not.

1666
01:41:59,106 --> 01:42:00,718
She has the right to take a call.

1667
01:42:00,967 --> 01:42:03,354
Since you both are not in good terms
you don't want the baby.

1668
01:42:03,434 --> 01:42:05,943
But she wants it.
Respect her emotions.

1669
01:42:06,953 --> 01:42:07,889
So?

1670
01:42:08,512 --> 01:42:13,265
The next time you fight
fight to become closer, not to win.

1671
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:26,368
Mom...

1672
01:42:35,490 --> 01:42:37,056
Our parents are very scared.

1673
01:42:37,540 --> 01:42:42,115
So, let's try to be
normal until they are here.

1674
01:42:48,263 --> 01:42:49,629
Mom!

1675
01:42:50,782 --> 01:42:53,809
Uncle!
- Good morning, Chintu dear!

1676
01:42:54,285 --> 01:42:55,496
Will you have breakfast?

1677
01:42:56,521 --> 01:43:00,091
Mom! Uncle!
- Chintu! What's wrong?

1678
01:43:00,341 --> 01:43:01,309
Uncle!

1679
01:43:02,327 --> 01:43:04,949
Mom!
- Chintu, what's wrong?

1680
01:43:05,029 --> 01:43:06,221
I'm sorry.

1681
01:43:06,447 --> 01:43:08,851
I shouldn't have shouted at you.
I'm sorry.

1682
01:43:11,576 --> 01:43:13,487
Chintu dear, I'm sorry.

1683
01:43:13,946 --> 01:43:15,278
I shouldn't have shouted too.

1684
01:43:15,694 --> 01:43:17,501
I'm sorry. So sorry.

1685
01:43:17,581 --> 01:43:19,274
Friends?

1686
01:43:21,412 --> 01:43:22,770
Friends!
- Friends!

1687
01:43:32,055 --> 01:43:33,003
What?

1688
01:43:36,954 --> 01:43:39,645
She wants me to act normal
until our families leave.

1689
01:43:41,748 --> 01:43:44,654
But how? I get so angry
the moment I see her.

1690
01:43:45,927 --> 01:43:48,265
You don't know.
She caused me great suffering.

1691
01:43:49,102 --> 01:43:50,721
More than what I
suffered in your hands?

1692
01:43:52,292 --> 01:43:53,814
I lost my seat in
a wonderful college.

1693
01:43:54,312 --> 01:43:56,561
I'm reduced to begging
in a foreign country.

1694
01:43:57,758 --> 01:43:58,575
Look at this.

1695
01:43:58,655 --> 01:44:01,176
'Fourteen kilometers to
the nearest police station.'

1696
01:44:01,709 --> 01:44:03,888
But I forgot everything
and talk to you with a smile.

1697
01:44:04,227 --> 01:44:05,721
I became friends with your families.

1698
01:44:06,164 --> 01:44:09,651
Can't you forget everything for
a few days and act normal with her?

1699
01:44:10,018 --> 01:44:11,222
Can't you do at least that?

1700
01:44:13,118 --> 01:44:14,405
Okay, do one thing.

1701
01:44:14,744 --> 01:44:17,041
When we are very angry with someone

1702
01:44:17,373 --> 01:44:19,151
we'll instantly cool
down if we remember

1703
01:44:19,231 --> 01:44:20,957
the sweet memories
that we had with them.

1704
01:44:21,407 --> 01:44:22,874
We both don't have
any such memories.

1705
01:44:22,954 --> 01:44:24,147
Not a chance.

1706
01:44:24,459 --> 01:44:28,465
Even the best of friends
fight at least once in their lives.

1707
01:44:29,717 --> 01:44:31,620
Even the worst of enemies

1708
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:34,104
shake their hands at
least once in their lives.

1709
01:44:39,633 --> 01:44:43,002
Brother! Think about it.
You'll find at least one.

1710
01:44:48,912 --> 01:44:50,012
What happened?

1711
01:44:52,288 --> 01:44:53,464
Baby is kicking.

1712
01:44:53,955 --> 01:44:55,595
What? Is that possible?

1713
01:44:55,675 --> 01:44:57,650
Of course. Do you want to feel it?
- Yes.

1714
01:44:59,484 --> 01:45:00,619
Wait.

1715
01:45:02,723 --> 01:45:04,065
See?
- Wow.

1716
01:45:09,717 --> 01:45:10,782
Uncle!

1717
01:45:17,597 --> 01:45:21,915
Uncle! You've to see this.
It's really amazing.

1718
01:45:22,578 --> 01:45:25,560
The baby is kicking inside.
You've to feel it.

1719
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:26,639
What?

1720
01:45:33,122 --> 01:45:34,281
Nice, no?

1721
01:45:55,946 --> 01:45:58,160
When did you come back from college?

1722
01:45:59,962 --> 01:46:01,007
Did you take your tablets?

1723
01:46:01,381 --> 01:46:02,564
Not yet, mom.
- Arjun.

1724
01:46:02,896 --> 01:46:04,716
Bring the tablets from Anu's room.

1725
01:46:35,226 --> 01:46:37,032
It's mine.
- 'Arjun! Give the car to Anu.'

1726
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:49,653
Arjun!

1727
01:47:21,016 --> 01:47:23,541
'Think about it.
You'll find at least one.'

1728
01:47:58,410 --> 01:47:59,631
Give it to me.

1729
01:48:41,107 --> 01:48:43,810
Mom! We'll get late
for the appointment.

1730
01:48:45,436 --> 01:48:47,478
Aunt, wait. I'll take her.

1731
01:48:48,378 --> 01:48:49,399
Shall we go?

1732
01:49:14,015 --> 01:49:15,364
She's my first crush.

1733
01:49:15,523 --> 01:49:17,751
Uncle! Who was your first crush?

1734
01:49:17,889 --> 01:49:19,183
None other than our Anu.

1735
01:49:19,349 --> 01:49:20,379
Really?

1736
01:49:28,979 --> 01:49:32,171
Brother-in-law!
You married my sister forcefully.

1737
01:49:32,707 --> 01:49:34,843
How are you so happy now?

1738
01:49:38,527 --> 01:49:42,255
I used to fight with her
every day after our marriage.

1739
01:49:43,259 --> 01:49:44,686
She endured it with patience.

1740
01:49:45,455 --> 01:49:48,439
She answered with a
smile even when I shouted.

1741
01:49:49,079 --> 01:49:52,279
She continued loving me
no matter how much I hated her.

1742
01:49:52,936 --> 01:49:55,894
But slowly she started
giving up on me.

1743
01:49:56,526 --> 01:49:58,931
She's human, after all.
She got tired.

1744
01:50:00,037 --> 01:50:03,281
She has dignity too. She felt hurt.

1745
01:50:04,561 --> 01:50:06,974
Then I realized that
we never understand the value

1746
01:50:07,054 --> 01:50:09,984
of the ones who love
us as long as we hate them.

1747
01:50:10,243 --> 01:50:12,570
We understand it when
they start hating us.

1748
01:50:13,754 --> 01:50:16,737
I understood it. I corrected myself.

1749
01:50:18,510 --> 01:50:22,558
After that,
your sister never felt hurt.

1750
01:52:11,231 --> 01:52:12,546
Why did you want
to see me immediately?

1751
01:52:13,229 --> 01:52:15,244
They gave me a due date.
It is next week.

1752
01:52:15,737 --> 01:52:19,421
Wow. Should we go to
the hospital right now?

1753
01:52:19,827 --> 01:52:20,960
Arjun!

1754
01:52:21,877 --> 01:52:23,018
What's this?

1755
01:52:23,098 --> 01:52:24,281
Divorce papers.

1756
01:52:27,411 --> 01:52:28,700
It's over, Arjun.

1757
01:52:29,928 --> 01:52:30,975
We are done.

1758
01:52:32,592 --> 01:52:34,123
I won't let that happen.

1759
01:52:34,719 --> 01:52:35,852
Why not?

1760
01:52:37,618 --> 01:52:38,725
Arjun!

1761
01:52:41,180 --> 01:52:42,417
Arjun!

1762
01:52:43,905 --> 01:52:45,920
Because of this, Anu. This.

1763
01:52:48,478 --> 01:52:49,895
Those are my photos.

1764
01:52:49,975 --> 01:52:51,505
But I'm a part of them, Anu.

1765
01:52:52,121 --> 01:52:55,127
All your memories show
how much you like me.

1766
01:52:56,911 --> 01:52:58,251
I don't like you.

1767
01:52:58,986 --> 01:53:01,613
Then what is it?
Answer me.

1768
01:53:02,341 --> 01:53:03,509
It's love.

1769
01:53:05,463 --> 01:53:08,387
That's why I wanted
to be with you forever.

1770
01:53:09,580 --> 01:53:11,215
I tolerated all your mistakes.

1771
01:53:12,348 --> 01:53:14,623
I thought I can marry
you and change you.

1772
01:53:15,479 --> 01:53:17,866
I thought you'll change
if we become close.

1773
01:53:18,349 --> 01:53:23,236
But you are an idiot.
You are insensitive.

1774
01:53:24,387 --> 01:53:27,630
You said that I trapped you,
that I raped you...

1775
01:53:27,710 --> 01:53:30,138
I didn't say that, Anu.
- That's what you meant, Arjun.

1776
01:53:33,398 --> 01:53:35,041
I was willing to forgive all that.

1777
01:53:36,918 --> 01:53:39,997
But you touched my womb
and said you don't want it.

1778
01:53:40,612 --> 01:53:45,801
That second I decided
that I don't want you.

1779
01:53:47,486 --> 01:53:50,522
Anu, please.
I'm really very, very sorry.

1780
01:53:51,915 --> 01:53:54,086
I panicked in that moment...

1781
01:53:55,357 --> 01:53:56,818
Don't lie to me, Arjun.

1782
01:53:57,830 --> 01:54:00,520
I'm not Chintu to believe you.

1783
01:54:02,362 --> 01:54:06,246
Anu, what I told
Chintu that day is true.

1784
01:54:07,708 --> 01:54:09,541
You are my first crush.

1785
01:54:13,536 --> 01:54:14,738
God promise.

1786
01:54:20,887 --> 01:54:24,381
God keeps all the things
we want very close to us.

1787
01:54:24,726 --> 01:54:27,727
He keeps watching from
the heaven if we'll grab them.

1788
01:54:28,219 --> 01:54:29,837
He keeps giving us
hints from time to time.

1789
01:54:29,917 --> 01:54:34,585
He gave me many hints
but I didn't understand.

1790
01:54:36,826 --> 01:54:39,827
I didn't understand until
the baby in the womb kicked me.

1791
01:54:41,954 --> 01:54:45,535
March 6, 1999, exactly at 5:30 pm

1792
01:54:46,028 --> 01:54:48,397
I wished that God should
give me a girlfriend.

1793
01:54:49,029 --> 01:54:52,151
After exactly six seconds an Esteem
car stopped in our neighborhood.

1794
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:54,737
A four year old girl
got down from the car

1795
01:54:56,026 --> 01:54:58,768
wearing pink frock and pink shoes.

1796
01:55:02,807 --> 01:55:04,917
I fell for her as
soon as I saw her, Anu.

1797
01:55:07,711 --> 01:55:09,942
Not just me,
the whole colony fell for her.

1798
01:55:14,257 --> 01:55:15,952
Everyone who carried me
on their shoulders until then

1799
01:55:16,032 --> 01:55:17,691
suddenly forgot about me.

1800
01:55:18,512 --> 01:55:21,600
I became so jealous of
you that I started hating you.

1801
01:55:24,004 --> 01:55:26,296
That's why I didn't want you even
though you were right beside me.

1802
01:55:28,132 --> 01:55:30,121
Now I realized my
mistake and came to you

1803
01:55:30,692 --> 01:55:31,911
but you are rejecting me.

1804
01:55:33,130 --> 01:55:35,042
I feel like I'm drowning in the sea.

1805
01:55:36,036 --> 01:55:38,734
I can't breathe, Anu.
I can't breathe.

1806
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:45,410
Please.

1807
01:55:46,422 --> 01:55:49,068
Please give me one chance.

1808
01:55:49,942 --> 01:55:54,292
I'll turn all my hatred into love.
Please. Please.

1809
01:56:00,779 --> 01:56:02,423
Please.

1810
01:56:09,419 --> 01:56:10,630
Anu! Are you okay?

1811
01:56:13,287 --> 01:56:15,943
My water broke. The baby is coming.

1812
01:56:16,297 --> 01:56:17,452
But you said it is next week.

1813
01:56:17,832 --> 01:56:18,773
I don't know.

1814
01:56:19,237 --> 01:56:20,475
You said it is next week.

1815
01:56:20,614 --> 01:56:23,049
So what? You won't let it come now?

1816
01:56:23,464 --> 01:56:24,564
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

1817
01:56:24,644 --> 01:56:28,065
Call the ambulance.
- Okay, okay. Sit here.

1818
01:57:28,054 --> 01:57:29,327
Arjun! What's wrong?

1819
01:57:30,842 --> 01:57:33,457
I was so scared, dad.
She cried so much, you know.

1820
01:57:34,329 --> 01:57:35,443
Anu?

1821
01:57:36,357 --> 01:57:37,484
The baby, dad.

1822
01:57:47,697 --> 01:57:50,854
But she was so cute
when she was crying.

1823
01:57:51,157 --> 01:57:52,186
The baby?

1824
01:57:52,266 --> 01:57:53,717
Anu, dad.

1825
01:57:59,009 --> 01:58:02,425
She caught my finger
tightly and didn't let it go.

1826
01:58:02,979 --> 01:58:04,216
Anu?

1827
01:58:04,700 --> 01:58:05,867
The baby, dad.

1828
01:58:09,128 --> 01:58:11,015
She sleepily saw me
and gave me a small smile.

1829
01:58:11,095 --> 01:58:14,100
Wow, it was priceless, dad.

1830
01:58:14,750 --> 01:58:16,004
Priceless.

1831
01:58:17,510 --> 01:58:18,782
Anu or baby?

1832
01:58:21,204 --> 01:58:22,682
Both, dad.

1833
01:58:25,139 --> 01:58:26,721
When they were taking
us to the operation theater

1834
01:58:26,801 --> 01:58:28,122
I just had love for Anu.

1835
01:58:28,202 --> 01:58:31,098
But after going in,
my respect for her grew even more.

1836
01:58:32,733 --> 01:58:34,973
She endured so much, dad.

1837
01:58:35,371 --> 01:58:36,521
The pain?

1838
01:58:42,911 --> 01:58:43,804
'This.'

1839
01:58:43,884 --> 01:58:44,890
'He's my husband.'

1840
01:58:46,163 --> 01:58:47,526
Get married.

1841
01:58:48,376 --> 01:58:49,940
Why can't you say that you like me?

1842
01:58:50,376 --> 01:58:51,351
For you.

1843
01:58:59,875 --> 01:59:00,816
Me too.

1844
01:59:20,658 --> 01:59:23,184
Arjun! Arjun!

1845
01:59:24,077 --> 01:59:25,309
How long will you take?

1846
01:59:28,014 --> 01:59:29,204
Arjun!

1847
01:59:34,482 --> 01:59:35,727
How long should I wait?

1848
01:59:35,872 --> 01:59:38,529
When I was heating up the milk...

1849
01:59:38,609 --> 01:59:41,255
Why are you doing so much drama?

1850
01:59:41,733 --> 01:59:42,709
Why are you scolding me?

1851
01:59:42,789 --> 01:59:44,681
Do you want me to carry you instead?

1852
01:59:45,705 --> 01:59:46,570
Look at me.

1853
01:59:46,715 --> 01:59:48,472
We are suffering
under the hot sun and

1854
01:59:48,552 --> 01:59:50,279
you are enjoying yourself in the AC.

1855
01:59:50,576 --> 01:59:52,313
The milk...
- Shut up!

1856
01:59:52,393 --> 01:59:53,752
'Oh no! Why is she
scolding me so much?'

1857
01:59:53,832 --> 01:59:55,773
'Did I unnecessarily
make too many promises?'

1858
01:59:55,853 --> 01:59:57,149
'How do I control her now?'

1859
01:59:57,229 --> 01:59:58,886
'Come on, Arjun.
Think of something.'

1860
01:59:58,966 --> 01:59:59,896
Anu!

1861
02:00:01,959 --> 02:00:02,921
Chocolate.

1862
02:00:03,710 --> 02:00:05,765
Your chocolates won't
get you out of trouble.

1863
02:00:05,904 --> 02:00:08,678
I used to shower all my
love and anger on you in the past.

1864
02:00:08,758 --> 02:00:10,200
But now I have her.
She'll get all my love

1865
02:00:10,280 --> 02:00:11,370
and you'll get all my anger.

1866
02:00:16,325 --> 02:00:17,231
Let's go.
