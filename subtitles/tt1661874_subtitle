1
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:01,786
Catch her.

2
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:43,061
- where"s that girl? - what
will we tell Mr.Dabholkar?

3
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:44,602
- Let"s look there.
- Let"s go.

4
00:03:53,115 --> 00:03:57,279
The girl has escaped.

5
00:03:57,386 --> 00:04:00,583
How are we to
face Dabholkar now?

6
00:04:00,655 --> 00:04:02,885
Let"s go.

7
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:15,099
- Babholkar here.
- lnspector Khan speaking.

8
00:04:15,337 --> 00:04:19,706
Did my men kidnap
that club dancer?

9
00:04:19,775 --> 00:04:22,300
wouldn"t it be foolish
to expect those cowards...

10
00:04:22,377 --> 00:04:27,679
... to accomplish things
which require courage?

11
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:30,445
- what nonsense?
- The girl has escaped.

12
00:04:30,552 --> 00:04:35,319
At present your men
are trembling with fear...

13
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:39,588
... and are searching
for a place to hide.

14
00:04:39,694 --> 00:04:41,389
You know very well
that l feel restless...

15
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:46,059
... if l don"t find a new
girl everyday to romance.

16
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,940
what"s the matter, Khan?
why are you silent?

17
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:57,034
l"ll call you later.

18
00:04:57,112 --> 00:04:59,080
wait for my call.

19
00:04:59,147 --> 00:05:01,638
Call me back soon.

20
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:11,353
what"s the matter? why
are you roaming around...

21
00:05:11,426 --> 00:05:15,590
... alone in this
obscure dark night?

22
00:05:15,697 --> 00:05:20,532
l"m not roaming around.
l just came from Nasik.

23
00:05:20,602 --> 00:05:24,766
l"m getting late. Excuse
Me. l need to call my mother.

24
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,368
Do you really want to call
your mother or is it that you...

25
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:33,175
... want to make an appointment
for the night with a rich man?

26
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:37,146
lnspector, not
everyone is like that.

27
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:39,751
l have no other choice but
to be here at this moment.

28
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:43,382
And l have no other choice
but to be suspicious about you.

29
00:05:43,492 --> 00:05:48,395
Officers like you who fail to
learn from the experiences...

30
00:05:48,463 --> 00:05:52,957
... of life begin
to suspect others.

31
00:05:53,034 --> 00:05:56,401
Just like those
ignorant people...

32
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:59,599
... who only know to suspect.

33
00:05:59,674 --> 00:06:03,075
l"ve had enough
experiences in my life.

34
00:06:03,144 --> 00:06:08,411
Come with me to the Police
Station. And if in case my ...

35
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:14,149
... suspicion turns out to be
true,then you won"t be spared.

36
00:06:14,256 --> 00:06:20,957
- Police station! why not?
- Get in.

37
00:06:30,739 --> 00:06:32,536
what"s your name?

38
00:06:32,607 --> 00:06:37,909
what do you do?

39
00:06:38,013 --> 00:06:45,249
You"ll be shocked to hear that.

40
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:50,015
Oh really?

41
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:54,255
Then l"ll scare you to death.

42
00:06:54,496 --> 00:06:56,555
You speak too much.

43
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:59,464
lf l get a single
evidence against you...

44
00:06:59,534 --> 00:07:01,934
... l can create a
big issue over it.

45
00:07:02,037 --> 00:07:04,471
l"ll lock you up in
the cell the whole night...

46
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:08,270
... and thrash you
up beyond recognition.

47
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:12,606
l can even ruin your life.

48
00:07:12,714 --> 00:07:20,177
All this seems
to be stolen goods.

49
00:07:30,532 --> 00:07:32,727
You were out to ruin my life!

50
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:35,531
You wanted to teach me a lesson!

51
00:07:35,604 --> 00:07:37,970
Now what do you have to say?

52
00:07:38,073 --> 00:07:46,105
l"m lnspector Kiran and
l"ll be your senior here.

53
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:58,515
l"ll take legal
action against you.

54
00:07:58,593 --> 00:08:05,522
l"ll file a report
against you in which...

55
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,537
... l"ll mention that
you are a corrupt officer...

56
00:08:10,605 --> 00:08:14,063
...and bring to fore all those
repulsive secrets about you!

57
00:08:14,175 --> 00:08:17,770
Please don"t do that. l
have a family to look after.

58
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:22,316
l promise l won"t do this
again. Please forgive me.

59
00:08:23,952 --> 00:08:29,720
That"s impossible.

60
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,954
l"ll retire day after tomorrow.

61
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:36,555
lf you take a legal
action against me...

62
00:08:36,631 --> 00:08:40,032
... then l won"t be able to
face others. Please forgive me.

63
00:08:40,602 --> 00:08:44,129
Okay.

64
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:45,968
l"ll forgive you.

65
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:50,205
But l need your signature
on this Blank paper.

66
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:53,179
Signatures?

67
00:08:53,281 --> 00:08:58,378
So that henceforth if
you do any such thing...

68
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,387
... this paper will be
of great use for me.

69
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:07,061
But...

70
00:09:07,128 --> 00:09:11,827
You better sign if you
care for your reputation.

71
00:09:11,933 --> 00:09:15,334
Okay... l"ll sign.

72
00:09:26,981 --> 00:09:29,108
Come on ... sign it.

73
00:09:42,664 --> 00:09:46,430
Mother...

74
00:09:46,701 --> 00:09:51,866
My dearest mother!

75
00:09:52,006 --> 00:09:55,635
- what took you so long? - lt
was already late by the time...

76
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:01,410
... l reached here. Then l had
to go to the police station too.

77
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:05,710
l thought that l should come
to meet you in my uniform.

78
00:10:05,787 --> 00:10:07,880
Good you did that.

79
00:10:07,989 --> 00:10:10,787
You look impressive
in this uniform.

80
00:10:10,892 --> 00:10:16,159
Today is the death anniversary
of your father and your sister.

81
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:23,330
Mother, how can
l ever forget that?

82
00:10:23,404 --> 00:10:28,706
l lost my father and my
elder sister on this very day.

83
00:10:28,777 --> 00:10:33,407
And l wonder where
my younger sister is.

84
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:36,678
This tragic incident in my
life inspired me to take up...

85
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:42,189
... this profession so that
l could avenge their death.

86
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:48,161
Child, you"ve done
just the right thing.

87
00:10:48,263 --> 00:10:50,697
You"ve taken initial
step towards your goal...

88
00:10:50,765 --> 00:10:54,792
... but don"t waver
from your path.

89
00:10:57,739 --> 00:10:59,866
Madam is here

90
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:20,453
The very same girl who dares to
dream @ achieve those dreams!

91
00:11:20,762 --> 00:11:26,462
lt"s this attitude of yours that
has made you lnspector Kiran.

92
00:11:26,768 --> 00:11:29,862
l have not yet achieved
my goal, lnspector.

93
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:31,734
- what do you mean?
- l want to reopen the file...

94
00:11:31,806 --> 00:11:35,537
... of the murder and rape
which took place 12 years ago.

95
00:11:35,777 --> 00:11:39,736
- why? - Because the
accused managed to escape...

96
00:11:39,814 --> 00:11:44,114
... by taking advantage of
the shortcomings of our law.

97
00:11:44,185 --> 00:11:45,982
which case are you referring to?

98
00:11:46,054 --> 00:11:47,749
Sir, this incident took
place twelve years ago.

99
00:11:47,822 --> 00:11:53,556
On 15th October 1999, they
looted the National Herald Bank.

100
00:12:36,838 --> 00:12:39,602
That lnspector won"t
be able to arrest us.

101
00:13:30,892 --> 00:13:33,656
Don"t move.

102
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:35,863
Otherwise l"ll shoot!

103
00:13:35,964 --> 00:13:40,663
You are under arrest.

104
00:13:50,511 --> 00:13:55,881
You seem to be very happy
to have us in your custody.

105
00:13:55,984 --> 00:14:00,978
You seem to have forgotten
how dangerous we are.

106
00:14:01,055 --> 00:14:06,083
You won"t be able to save
yourself from our wrath.

107
00:14:06,227 --> 00:14:10,687
You mean nothing to me.

108
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:13,924
You are a stigma
on this society...

109
00:14:14,002 --> 00:14:16,903
... and l want to put an
end to reign of terror.

110
00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:20,065
l"ll see to it that you
are taken to the gallows.

111
00:14:20,141 --> 00:14:24,601
lnspector, we looted
Rs.25lakhs from the bank.

112
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:26,977
You can keep 5 lakhs
and give the rest to us.

113
00:14:27,048 --> 00:14:32,008
- Do you agree? - l can
earn millions if l want.

114
00:14:32,086 --> 00:14:34,714
But l don"t intend to do so.

115
00:14:34,956 --> 00:14:41,088
l derive greater happiness from
punishing criminals like you.

116
00:14:41,162 --> 00:14:46,725
But what will you
gain by punishing us?

117
00:14:46,968 --> 00:14:52,736
Just an insignificant medal
which has no value at all.

118
00:14:52,974 --> 00:14:57,934
The medal means much more...

119
00:14:58,012 --> 00:15:03,473
... than riches to me.

120
00:15:07,321 --> 00:15:09,152
- Oh well! - lnspector, you"ll
have to bear the consequences.

121
00:15:09,223 --> 00:15:12,681
l"ll ruin your life.

122
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,957
You are in my custody now.

123
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:20,296
l"ll make your life miserable.

124
00:15:20,401 --> 00:15:26,636
lnspector Bakshi,
keep an eye on them.

125
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:30,973
You don"t know
what you are doing.

126
00:15:31,045 --> 00:15:35,209
You are inviting your own
doom, what do you say?

127
00:15:35,316 --> 00:15:38,217
Don"t worry Sir.

128
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:40,981
Sir, l assure
you that l won"t...

129
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:45,515
... allow them to escape.

130
00:15:45,693 --> 00:15:50,426
Don"t worry,
Sir, l"ll be here.

131
00:15:56,037 --> 00:15:58,801
l"ll call you later.

132
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:08,014
And here"s your bubblegum.

133
00:16:08,116 --> 00:16:10,141
You"ll need it.

134
00:16:21,229 --> 00:16:25,029
lnspector, remember
what you had said...

135
00:16:25,099 --> 00:16:29,399
... that we"ll
lead a miserable...

136
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:33,201
... life behind the bars, right?

137
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:42,209
Now tell me... who"ll
lead a miserable life?

138
00:16:54,095 --> 00:16:56,325
He wanted to put
us behind the bars.

139
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,193
He has been liberated forever.

140
00:17:03,104 --> 00:17:06,267
Catch that girl.

141
00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:33,726
wait... it"s my turn.

142
00:17:41,142 --> 00:17:43,906
Stop!

143
00:17:44,145 --> 00:17:48,206
Oh no... don"t shoot.

144
00:17:48,282 --> 00:17:52,912
Please don"t shoot.

145
00:18:07,168 --> 00:18:09,432
what an experience that was!

146
00:18:09,503 --> 00:18:11,801
Go there.

147
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,148
Go soon.

148
00:18:33,194 --> 00:18:36,186
Hey no...not again!

149
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:50,510
Please save me.
Shall l come with you?

150
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:52,875
Come in.

151
00:18:52,947 --> 00:18:56,644
- Let"s go Driver.
- Yes Madam.

152
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,912
what? lnspector Karma
has been murdered?

153
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,323
And even your
daughter has been raped?

154
00:19:06,427 --> 00:19:08,793
But how did this happen?

155
00:19:08,896 --> 00:19:12,957
l won"t spare those who
are guilty of this crime.

156
00:19:13,034 --> 00:19:15,901
Just tell me their names.

157
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:21,340
l"ll shoot all of them under
the pretext of an encounter.

158
00:19:21,442 --> 00:19:24,741
who killed him?

159
00:19:24,912 --> 00:19:30,782
They are same people
who had looted the bank.

160
00:19:30,851 --> 00:19:34,412
He had arrested those criminals.

161
00:19:34,588 --> 00:19:37,523
Did they murder him?

162
00:19:37,591 --> 00:19:39,616
Yes, they are the
very same people.

163
00:19:45,032 --> 00:19:50,026
l can see that you are rather
shocked by this tragic incident.

164
00:19:50,271 --> 00:19:54,332
Perhaps that"s why you are
blaming the wrong people.

165
00:19:54,408 --> 00:19:57,241
l"m not in a state of shock...

166
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,802
l can recognise each one of them.

167
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,848
Can you recognise them?

168
00:20:01,949 --> 00:20:04,247
- very well. - Okay.
Constable. - Yes Sir.

169
00:20:04,318 --> 00:20:09,813
Bring Rana, Fazlu
and Dabholkar here.

170
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:12,984
what"s the matter, lnspector?

171
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,789
what"s your problem?

172
00:20:16,664 --> 00:20:21,567
The mosquitoes feasted
on us last night.

173
00:20:21,635 --> 00:20:25,298
we had just managed to
sleep... but you woke us up.

174
00:20:25,373 --> 00:20:30,902
Are you sure they
were the same people?

175
00:20:30,978 --> 00:20:33,708
Yes, l am sure.

176
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:40,414
They are the same
people who ruined my life.

177
00:20:46,827 --> 00:20:49,352
Sister in law, l
think you are mistaken.

178
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:54,390
Because they were in
my custody last night.

179
00:20:54,468 --> 00:20:57,335
Then how can they
commit the murder.

180
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:02,673
l know everything lnspector.

181
00:21:02,743 --> 00:21:08,875
l know very well
that the four of them...

182
00:21:08,949 --> 00:21:13,648
... can do nothing
without your help.

183
00:21:13,754 --> 00:21:15,722
Even you are with them.

184
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,782
Any problem?

185
00:21:18,893 --> 00:21:22,556
- But where is she? - There
she is, right in front of you.

186
00:21:22,696 --> 00:21:27,326
But remember,
you too will die...

187
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:33,033
... a miserable death.

188
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:40,904
Today l curse you...

189
00:21:41,015 --> 00:21:43,506
... you will certainly
die a miserable death.

190
00:21:47,521 --> 00:21:50,354
And in this
manner they killed...

191
00:21:50,424 --> 00:21:53,587
... the man who was
true to his duty.

192
00:21:53,661 --> 00:21:57,358
Now they must be
somewhere amassing riches...

193
00:21:57,431 --> 00:22:01,162
...celebrating
the defeat of law!

194
00:22:01,402 --> 00:22:03,393
How do you know all this?

195
00:22:03,471 --> 00:22:06,599
who are those people whom
you are talking about?

196
00:22:06,707 --> 00:22:10,370
This is my own story, Sir.

197
00:22:10,444 --> 00:22:14,813
lnspector Karma was my father.

198
00:22:14,882 --> 00:22:20,843
And the girl who was
raped was my elder sister.

199
00:22:20,955 --> 00:22:25,790
l wonder where
my other sister is.

200
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:32,823
My younger sister Sapna
killed lnspector Bakshi.

201
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,494
And she ran away
after killing him.

202
00:22:35,569 --> 00:22:38,197
l wonder where she is now.

203
00:22:40,908 --> 00:22:43,672
This is my younger
sister Sapna"s photograph.

204
00:22:50,918 --> 00:22:53,546
Mr.Dabholkar, listen to me.

205
00:22:53,654 --> 00:22:55,417
Stop scratching and
get ready for a...

206
00:22:55,489 --> 00:22:58,481
... romantic rendezvous
with this girl.

207
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:02,751
l can stop anything
but not itching.

208
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:06,425
By the way... if l have
to scratch...l mean...

209
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:11,904
... if l have to meet this
girl, where should l go?

210
00:23:12,006 --> 00:23:16,443
Not very far.
Just a few steps away...

211
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:21,106
... she works as the bar
dancer in that hotel.

212
00:23:21,181 --> 00:23:24,446
She"ll be performing today.

213
00:23:24,552 --> 00:23:28,784
l"ll fix your appointment with
her soon after her performance.

214
00:23:28,889 --> 00:23:33,019
what are you waiting for?
Go soon and do your work.

215
00:23:33,127 --> 00:23:36,528
Once the work is over,
they drive you out.

216
00:23:36,597 --> 00:23:41,500
Her alluring beauty
has made me restless.

217
00:23:41,569 --> 00:23:44,766
where are you, O my love?

218
00:23:57,918 --> 00:24:00,546
""l"ve created a
sensation in this town""

219
00:24:01,522 --> 00:24:06,289
""l"m a gorgeous beauty""

220
00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:10,293
""My alluring beauty...""

221
00:24:13,334 --> 00:24:16,064
""... has made
my life difficult""

222
00:24:37,358 --> 00:24:40,521
""There are so many
who desire to touch me...""

223
00:24:40,594 --> 00:24:43,290
"" But mind you...
it"s not that easy""

224
00:24:53,574 --> 00:24:55,906
""l"m so scared!""

225
00:25:27,608 --> 00:25:31,374
""There are so many
who crave for me""

226
00:25:31,612 --> 00:25:34,877
""They beseech for a
single moment of love""

227
00:25:46,627 --> 00:25:48,993
""There are so
many who fall for me""

228
00:26:17,424 --> 00:26:20,621
You"ve created a
sensation in this town.

229
00:26:20,694 --> 00:26:23,822
You are a gorgeous beauty.

230
00:26:23,997 --> 00:26:29,435
Even my Boss
has fallen for you.

231
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,639
- what nonsense?
- Take this, it"s 10000.

232
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:40,112
- For what? - My boss
wants to make you his own.

233
00:26:40,214 --> 00:26:45,277
That"s impossible...pass
on that message to your boss.

234
00:26:45,352 --> 00:26:52,451
we know how to
make things possible.

235
00:26:52,693 --> 00:26:56,857
Catch her.

236
00:27:36,737 --> 00:27:39,399
Leave that girl.

237
00:27:39,473 --> 00:27:41,998
Else l won"t spare you.

238
00:27:42,075 --> 00:27:45,238
we"ve seen many like you.

239
00:27:45,412 --> 00:27:47,710
And they landed
in the hospital!

240
00:27:47,815 --> 00:27:51,012
Or at times we even killed them.

241
00:27:51,084 --> 00:27:54,110
Get lost is you
care for your life.

242
00:27:54,188 --> 00:27:57,453
l"m not a coward like them.

243
00:27:57,524 --> 00:28:01,085
You cannot harm me.

244
00:28:01,161 --> 00:28:03,527
But l can certainly
put an end to my enemies.

245
00:28:03,764 --> 00:28:06,062
- How"s that?
- l"ll show you.

246
00:28:54,815 --> 00:28:57,545
Let me see how
you escape from us.

247
00:29:11,465 --> 00:29:16,596
Hey you! Spoilt brat...
how dare you do that?

248
00:29:16,837 --> 00:29:20,170
- Come to the police station.
- Please listen to me.

249
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,936
- l don"t want to hear anything.
- But a girl...

250
00:29:23,043 --> 00:29:25,944
- Please listen to me.
- l know you people well.

251
00:29:26,013 --> 00:29:30,814
You can be sentenced
to one month imprisonment.

252
00:29:30,918 --> 00:29:34,615
Only then will people
like you learn a lesson.

253
00:29:34,855 --> 00:29:37,824
Madam, it"s not without a
reason that l behaved like that.

254
00:29:37,891 --> 00:29:41,292
l had a valid reason.

255
00:29:41,395 --> 00:29:44,558
Let"s see.

256
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:49,995
- lnspector...
- what"s it?

257
00:29:56,143 --> 00:30:00,102
what brings you
here at this hour?

258
00:30:00,213 --> 00:30:02,340
why did you arrest him?

259
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:05,078
what right do you
have to ask me that?

260
00:30:05,185 --> 00:30:10,885
l just want to know
are innocents punished too?

261
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:14,985
So you think that he is innocent.

262
00:30:15,095 --> 00:30:19,122
He tried to save
me from those goons.

263
00:30:19,232 --> 00:30:26,297
- And you arrested him? - You
look like a bar dancer to me.

264
00:30:26,373 --> 00:30:28,898
You are talking
about your honour?

265
00:30:28,976 --> 00:30:33,538
which is sold even
before the show is over!

266
00:30:33,613 --> 00:30:37,674
You are a police officer...
you earn a good salary too.

267
00:30:37,918 --> 00:30:43,049
You lead a luxurious life, so
you fail to understand the poor.

268
00:30:43,123 --> 00:30:47,685
we are forced to do
anything to earn a living.

269
00:30:47,928 --> 00:30:50,419
You have no right
to comment on our life!

270
00:30:50,497 --> 00:30:54,991
Try to put an end to the
malignancies of this society.

271
00:30:55,068 --> 00:31:01,132
Or else you"ll repent for life.

272
00:31:01,942 --> 00:31:05,708
You can"t suppress
truth like that.

273
00:31:05,946 --> 00:31:08,915
You didn"t arrest the goons
who tried to rape me...

274
00:31:08,982 --> 00:31:12,440
... isn"t this injustice?

275
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:17,047
And you arrested the
person who saved me.

276
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:20,021
l"m ready to give his bail.

277
00:31:20,093 --> 00:31:26,032
- Constable. - Yes Sir.
- Leave that man.

278
00:31:40,981 --> 00:31:43,449
You were so brash.

279
00:31:43,517 --> 00:31:47,351
Those who lead a solitary
life have to be like that.

280
00:31:47,421 --> 00:31:48,479
Are you all alone?

281
00:31:48,555 --> 00:31:51,217
A few moments ago,
l was all alone...

282
00:31:51,324 --> 00:31:53,224
... but now l have a well wisher.

283
00:31:53,326 --> 00:31:54,725
l wonder how long
he will be with me.

284
00:31:54,795 --> 00:31:56,490
whom are you talking about?

285
00:31:56,663 --> 00:31:58,961
About you. Since l was
separated from my parents...

286
00:31:59,032 --> 00:32:02,627
... l"ve been
struggling all alone.

287
00:32:02,702 --> 00:32:05,671
But today you fought for me.

288
00:32:05,739 --> 00:32:08,765
l felt as if l was not alone.

289
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:10,306
And you fought
with the lnspector.

290
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:14,744
l felt as if l"ve met
my long lost friend.

291
00:32:15,015 --> 00:32:18,781
l couldn"t control my
anger when she abused me.

292
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:21,419
Tell me something
about yourself.

293
00:32:21,488 --> 00:32:23,979
- where are your parents?
- l just remember that...

294
00:32:24,057 --> 00:32:28,426
... l was separated from my
parents when l was just a child.

295
00:32:28,495 --> 00:32:32,295
A club dancer helped
me and l became one too.

296
00:32:32,365 --> 00:32:37,166
She died some years ago.
l wonder where my parents are.

297
00:32:37,237 --> 00:32:42,470
why don"t you do one thing?
You meet my father...

298
00:32:42,576 --> 00:32:44,271
He has got good contacts.

299
00:32:44,377 --> 00:32:47,005
l"m sure he"ll hell you
to find your parents.

300
00:32:47,114 --> 00:32:49,742
So many years have passed
by... how"s it possible?

301
00:32:49,816 --> 00:32:56,312
lt certainly isn"t:t impossible.

302
00:32:56,389 --> 00:32:59,119
You want to meet
your parents, right?

303
00:32:59,192 --> 00:33:01,160
- Yes. - Then come with me.

304
00:33:02,062 --> 00:33:05,395
ls this your house?

305
00:33:05,465 --> 00:33:08,059
Yes... l stay here.

306
00:33:08,135 --> 00:33:09,466
Come on in.

307
00:33:15,075 --> 00:33:17,703
Come upstairs.

308
00:33:17,777 --> 00:33:20,041
Your work will be done.

309
00:33:20,147 --> 00:33:23,742
Don"t worry. Be at ease.

310
00:33:23,817 --> 00:33:28,117
Daddy, l want you to meet someone.

311
00:33:28,188 --> 00:33:33,057
- who"s she?
- She"s Sapna.

312
00:33:50,777 --> 00:33:52,506
Daddy, she needs your help.

313
00:33:52,579 --> 00:33:57,107
But l think l need
help at this moment.

314
00:33:57,184 --> 00:33:59,880
Bring her some other time.

315
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,214
Okay, let"s go.

316
00:34:09,329 --> 00:34:13,129
Sorry for that.

317
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,660
lt"s enough that l saw him.

318
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:48,930
Fazlu... the blind man.

319
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:58,640
My first victim would
be lnspector Khan.

320
00:34:58,745 --> 00:35:01,145
Stop that nonsense,
lnspector Kiran.

321
00:35:02,182 --> 00:35:05,151
Neither have l been a party
to any of their evil exploits...

322
00:35:05,252 --> 00:35:08,153
... nor have l taken
any bribe from them.

323
00:35:08,255 --> 00:35:13,318
Since childhood l"ve been...

324
00:35:13,393 --> 00:35:17,796
... searching for th five of you.

325
00:35:17,864 --> 00:35:20,958
l recognised you in
the very first meeting.

326
00:35:21,201 --> 00:35:25,604
But l couldn"t take
any action against you.

327
00:35:25,672 --> 00:35:31,269
But then l certainly
scored a point over you.

328
00:35:31,344 --> 00:35:37,305
- what? - l had asked you sign
a blank paper the other day.

329
00:35:37,417 --> 00:35:41,376
Now if you
don"t listen to me...

330
00:35:41,454 --> 00:35:44,184
... l can easily trap
you in a criminal case...

331
00:35:44,257 --> 00:35:49,991
... and make your life miserable.

332
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,858
That would be illegal.

333
00:35:52,932 --> 00:35:57,494
Such words don"t suit you.

334
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:03,770
So you better not
give me such advises.

335
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:08,438
Tell me, will you do as l say?

336
00:36:08,581 --> 00:36:12,244
- what do you want me to do?
- Testify against them.

337
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:14,480
Help me to arrest them.

338
00:36:14,587 --> 00:36:20,856
lnspector, take
your decision soon.

339
00:38:25,051 --> 00:38:30,785
what"s the matter, Rana?
why do you look so tense?

340
00:38:30,857 --> 00:38:37,888
we"ll be facing the
consequences of our sins...

341
00:38:37,964 --> 00:38:39,864
... which we committed 12
years ago. - what do you mean?

342
00:38:39,933 --> 00:38:45,371
The daughter of the
lnspector whom we had killed ...

343
00:38:45,438 --> 00:38:52,173
...12 years ago has taken charge
of this area as the lnspector.

344
00:38:52,412 --> 00:38:56,746
She even interrogated
Khan about us.

345
00:38:56,816 --> 00:39:00,775
She"s forcing him
to testify against us.

346
00:39:00,854 --> 00:39:05,723
whoever she is, she"s just a girl!

347
00:39:05,825 --> 00:39:09,556
we"ll teach her a lesson.

348
00:39:09,629 --> 00:39:13,395
You should always
beware of the police...

349
00:39:13,466 --> 00:39:18,165
...lt will create a big problem
if we harm even one of them.

350
00:39:18,438 --> 00:39:23,876
Then how are we to stop them?

351
00:39:23,977 --> 00:39:27,777
Only lnspector Khan
can lead her to us.

352
00:39:27,847 --> 00:39:35,549
But what if"s not
there to show the way?

353
00:39:35,655 --> 00:39:40,217
Dabholkar, do something.

354
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:04,607
- Ram here.-Tell me. - l just
saw a man going to Khan"s house.

355
00:40:04,684 --> 00:40:08,484
- He was incessantly scratching
himself. - was he?

356
00:40:08,555 --> 00:40:11,888
wait there. l"ll be
there in a moment.

357
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:24,159
Khan is no more!

358
00:40:56,536 --> 00:40:58,629
Madam, he committed suicide.

359
00:40:58,738 --> 00:41:02,299
He has not committed suicide.

360
00:41:02,542 --> 00:41:06,000
He has been murdered.

361
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,879
Had he committed suicide,
it would have been evident.

362
00:41:09,949 --> 00:41:12,281
- Send the body for post mortem.
- Okay Madam.

363
00:41:18,124 --> 00:41:22,322
who"s that? Hurry up, tell me.
l can"t bear this itching.

364
00:41:22,562 --> 00:41:26,692
l"ll put an end to
that problem of yours.

365
00:41:26,766 --> 00:41:28,927
Oh really?
Then tell me the cure.

366
00:41:29,569 --> 00:41:33,335
The cure is your death.

367
00:41:33,573 --> 00:41:35,905
who"s speaking?

368
00:41:35,975 --> 00:41:38,170
A witness to your crime...

369
00:41:38,244 --> 00:41:42,578
... a victim of your atrocities.

370
00:41:42,649 --> 00:41:45,709
l"m lnspector Karma"s daughter.

371
00:41:45,785 --> 00:41:48,948
l"ll torture the
four of you to death.

372
00:41:49,022 --> 00:41:56,190
Oh really!
But l care the least.

373
00:41:56,262 --> 00:41:58,196
You can do me no harm.

374
00:41:58,264 --> 00:42:02,894
l"ll continue to
lead a luxurious life.

375
00:42:03,002 --> 00:42:08,372
Just look at your
watch. Now it"s 8 pm.

376
00:42:08,608 --> 00:42:12,567
But exactly at 8:30 you"ll...

377
00:42:12,645 --> 00:42:17,105
... come face
to face with death.

378
00:42:17,183 --> 00:42:21,210
Your time starts now.

379
00:42:33,433 --> 00:42:37,597
Rana, Dabholkar here.
Khan is no more.

380
00:42:37,704 --> 00:42:41,697
But just now a girl
threatened to kill me.

381
00:42:41,774 --> 00:42:44,743
She introduced herself as
lnspector Karma"s daughter.

382
00:42:44,844 --> 00:42:50,407
That means she is
lnspector Karma"s daughter.

383
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:55,314
You don"t worry.
l"ll deal with her.

384
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:03,686
But that he"ll do
only in the morning.

385
00:43:03,763 --> 00:43:06,129
But she"ll be coming here now.

386
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:08,895
what shall l do?

387
00:43:09,001 --> 00:43:10,901
l"ll have to do something.

388
00:43:11,003 --> 00:43:14,336
what shall l do?
where shall l go?

389
00:43:14,407 --> 00:43:18,776
what a mess! l don"t
even know that girl.

390
00:43:18,845 --> 00:43:23,214
Shall l leave this city?

391
00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:25,647
l just don"t understand.

392
00:43:25,752 --> 00:43:28,812
l think l should go from here.

393
00:44:08,728 --> 00:44:11,492
Hey... he looks like me.

394
00:44:27,747 --> 00:44:30,875
l think the drinks
have got better of me.

395
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:36,718
l feel as if l"m seeing my
reflection but without a mirror.

396
00:44:36,823 --> 00:44:41,317
By any chance, are
you my twin brother?

397
00:44:41,394 --> 00:44:43,828
l"m the King and
you are the Pauper.

398
00:44:43,896 --> 00:44:47,229
Let"s switch roles.

399
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:51,326
Take this car
and my house keys...

400
00:44:51,404 --> 00:44:54,430
- Everything is yours.
- l hope you are not joking.

401
00:44:54,507 --> 00:44:56,737
- Oh no.
- Do you know driving?

402
00:44:56,843 --> 00:45:01,746
l was a driver for. But in an
accident l killed 6 children...

403
00:45:01,814 --> 00:45:06,308
... and my license was canceled.
Then l became a beggar.

404
00:45:06,452 --> 00:45:10,252
Okay then, let"s
exchange our clothes.

405
00:45:16,796 --> 00:45:20,129
lt"s been days since
l last sat in a car.

406
00:45:31,811 --> 00:45:35,008
Your time starts now.

407
00:45:37,817 --> 00:45:40,012
That was a perfect timing.

408
00:45:40,152 --> 00:45:43,815
l have escaped death.

409
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:47,382
l have deceived the
lnspector"s daughter.

410
00:45:47,493 --> 00:45:52,362
Give me alms...

411
00:45:52,498 --> 00:45:56,594
Give me something for God"s sake.

412
00:45:56,836 --> 00:45:59,396
Take this.

413
00:45:59,472 --> 00:46:01,531
what"s this?

414
00:46:01,641 --> 00:46:02,835
Half a note?

415
00:46:02,909 --> 00:46:06,276
Even your life is
like this note, Dabholkar.

416
00:46:06,379 --> 00:46:09,815
There"s just 5 minutes
left for 8:30 pm.

417
00:46:09,882 --> 00:46:13,079
So, what will you do?

418
00:46:13,185 --> 00:46:15,551
will you shoot me?
will you behead me?

419
00:46:15,621 --> 00:46:18,181
l know what"s to be done.

420
00:46:18,257 --> 00:46:21,818
A pinch of this itching powder...

421
00:46:21,894 --> 00:46:26,388
... and no one can save you.

422
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:33,839
Take this.

423
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,899
You are repeating
the same mistake...

424
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:42,907
... you committed that night.

425
00:47:43,009 --> 00:47:45,910
The possibility can"t be ruled
out that you are attacked...

426
00:47:45,978 --> 00:47:49,914
... then again he"ll try to
save and then l"ll arrest him...

427
00:47:49,982 --> 00:47:54,510
... and then you"ll argue
with me to grant him a bail.

428
00:47:54,587 --> 00:47:57,920
Shun that sarcasm.
Be more specific.

429
00:47:58,024 --> 00:48:01,653
Take my advice and stop
roaming around in the night.

430
00:48:01,727 --> 00:48:06,960
Take it as an
elder sister"s advice.

431
00:48:07,033 --> 00:48:10,332
Perhaps you are right.

432
00:48:10,403 --> 00:48:14,737
But you should that there has
to be a reason for everything.

433
00:48:14,974 --> 00:48:17,568
There has to be some motive.

434
00:48:17,643 --> 00:48:20,544
what are you doing
here at this hour?

435
00:48:20,613 --> 00:48:23,173
l have an important work to do.

436
00:48:23,315 --> 00:48:26,250
- what about you? - l have
finished doing an important thing.

437
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:29,719
what was that important work?

438
00:48:29,989 --> 00:48:32,958
Oh no... you
are a police officer.

439
00:48:33,025 --> 00:48:35,585
l would have certainly told
you, had you been my sister.

440
00:49:09,528 --> 00:49:13,089
So... even Dabholkar is no more!

441
00:49:13,165 --> 00:49:16,999
Till yesterday he
was an infamous goon!

442
00:49:17,069 --> 00:49:20,129
But he"s lost to anonymity.

443
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:23,470
- How"s that possible?
- He was a bag of diseases.

444
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:28,002
He was inflicted with all ...

445
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:33,017
... the possible
diseases in this world.

446
00:49:33,085 --> 00:49:38,045
And finally the diseases
got better of him.

447
00:49:38,124 --> 00:49:43,187
Oh no....he didn"t
die of diseases...

448
00:49:43,262 --> 00:49:45,822
... he has been killed.

449
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:57,566
l"m sure lnspector Kiran is the
mastermind behind this murder.

450
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:00,042
Are you talking about
lnspector Karma"s daughter?

451
00:50:00,146 --> 00:50:04,810
Dabholkar had called me just a
few moments before his death.

452
00:50:04,884 --> 00:50:09,844
lnspector Karma"s daughter
had threatened to kill him.

453
00:50:10,089 --> 00:50:12,683
And then she killed her.

454
00:50:12,758 --> 00:50:16,159
But the murder was made to
look like a natural death.

455
00:50:16,228 --> 00:50:19,197
- what does she want?
- Our death.

456
00:50:19,398 --> 00:50:21,366
She wants to take her revenge.

457
00:50:21,433 --> 00:50:25,733
She wants to avenge her
father"s and sister"s death.

458
00:50:25,804 --> 00:50:30,639
But before that, we"ll kill her.

459
00:50:30,743 --> 00:50:33,075
The post mortem
report says that ...

460
00:50:33,145 --> 00:50:36,546
... Dabholkar was suffering
from ltching disease.

461
00:50:36,649 --> 00:50:39,345
He scratched himself to death.

462
00:50:39,518 --> 00:50:41,349
But you say that
he has been murdered?

463
00:50:41,453 --> 00:50:47,449
l think that the post mortem
expert has been very negligent.

464
00:50:47,526 --> 00:50:53,089
Had the post mortem
been done carefully...

465
00:50:53,165 --> 00:50:56,100
... it would have been
known that someone had...

466
00:50:56,168 --> 00:50:59,160
... smeared itching
powder on him.

467
00:50:59,238 --> 00:51:03,334
what? ltching powder?

468
00:51:03,442 --> 00:51:10,177
This is ridiculous.

469
00:51:10,249 --> 00:51:13,810
You are right, Sir. l"m sure
his friends are behind this.

470
00:51:13,886 --> 00:51:16,116
l won"t spare them.

471
00:51:16,188 --> 00:51:18,247
Before that, think
about arresting them.

472
00:51:18,357 --> 00:51:20,518
How will you arrest
them without evidence?

473
00:51:20,593 --> 00:51:22,288
Do you even know
where they are?

474
00:51:22,361 --> 00:51:26,525
How long can they
remain in hiding, sir?

475
00:51:26,599 --> 00:51:30,933
And l know they are in
China Town at this moment.

476
00:51:50,189 --> 00:51:55,957
""One push from me""

477
00:51:56,195 --> 00:51:58,720
""And he reached Kolkata""

478
00:52:03,502 --> 00:52:07,165
""My beloved....l
gave him a slight nudge""

479
00:52:07,239 --> 00:52:11,539
""And he reached Kolkata""

480
00:52:33,465 --> 00:52:35,990
""My heart skips a beat...
when he looks at me""

481
00:52:36,235 --> 00:52:39,261
""l skip a beat...
when he holds my hand""

482
00:52:49,248 --> 00:52:52,581
""He tries to lure me""

483
00:52:52,651 --> 00:52:54,209
""who will persuade him?""

484
00:52:55,321 --> 00:53:01,726
""l gave him such a push""

485
00:53:01,794 --> 00:53:04,524
""That he reached Kolkata""

486
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:45,270
""He always tries to woo me.""

487
00:53:45,337 --> 00:53:48,465
""His very look intoxicates me""

488
00:53:58,317 --> 00:54:01,718
""And then gradually
he comes near me""

489
00:54:01,787 --> 00:54:03,448
""Passion overcomes me""

490
00:54:03,589 --> 00:54:08,288
""l"ve fallen for his charms""

491
00:54:48,367 --> 00:54:51,063
""Mischief in my eyes
and desire in my heart""

492
00:54:51,136 --> 00:54:54,503
""This is the first time
l"ve fallen for someone""

493
00:55:03,382 --> 00:55:07,546
""Oh... he"s so charming""

494
00:55:07,719 --> 00:55:09,653
""Oh... he"s so irresistible""

495
00:55:09,721 --> 00:55:16,820
""l was so much in love with him""

496
00:55:16,929 --> 00:55:19,159
""My beloved reached Kolkata""

497
00:55:47,459 --> 00:55:53,022
lnspector Kiran,
you"ve reached here finally!

498
00:55:53,098 --> 00:55:55,430
But now you won"t be
able to escape now.

499
00:55:55,501 --> 00:55:58,402
- what do you say?
- Catch her.

500
00:56:02,441 --> 00:56:04,534
Let me go.

501
00:57:28,527 --> 00:57:31,826
Let me go!

502
00:57:43,542 --> 00:57:47,273
Hand over that girl to us.

503
00:57:47,546 --> 00:57:50,310
Should l do that?

504
00:57:50,549 --> 00:57:53,518
what did you say?

505
00:58:27,586 --> 00:58:31,317
Do you want her now?

506
00:59:23,642 --> 00:59:26,406
Run!

507
00:59:34,753 --> 00:59:37,745
Thanks a lot...
for saving me.

508
00:59:37,856 --> 00:59:40,791
l"m Police lnspector Kiran.

509
00:59:44,863 --> 00:59:50,392
You"ve done a great
favour by saving my life.

510
00:59:50,669 --> 00:59:53,638
lf you ever need any help...

511
00:59:53,705 --> 00:59:56,640
... don"t hesitate to come to me.

512
00:59:56,742 --> 00:59:58,300
l"ll certainly help you.

513
00:59:58,376 --> 01:00:03,871
How much you can
help me is quite obvious!

514
01:00:03,982 --> 01:00:08,214
Had l not been here today,
what would have happened?

515
01:00:08,353 --> 01:00:11,151
Thanks and take care.

516
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:15,456
what"s this? why
don"t you take something?

517
01:00:15,694 --> 01:00:20,654
lt"s all because of him.
He was so strong.

518
01:00:20,766 --> 01:00:24,293
He gave us a nice thrashing.

519
01:00:24,369 --> 01:00:29,432
The girl was in our custody.

520
01:00:29,708 --> 01:00:33,701
But Shiwa came in between
and he did this to us.

521
01:00:39,718 --> 01:00:46,487
He"s prowess is unparalleled.

522
01:00:46,725 --> 01:00:53,392
whom are you talking about?

523
01:00:53,465 --> 01:00:58,368
l"ll tell you. He"s Shiwa.
He was released today.

524
01:00:58,436 --> 01:01:02,031
He was guilty of assassinating
the Chief Minister.

525
01:01:02,174 --> 01:01:05,974
Shiwa... the
name sounds familiar.

526
01:01:06,077 --> 01:01:08,739
Do you know him?

527
01:01:08,814 --> 01:01:13,717
There are many by that
name in our Hitlist.

528
01:01:13,785 --> 01:01:17,846
l wonder who this one is,
who wants to meet his doom.

529
01:01:17,923 --> 01:01:22,986
we"ll know that very soon.

530
01:01:23,061 --> 01:01:25,859
But before that we"ll
have to put an end...

531
01:01:25,964 --> 01:01:29,900
- ... to our greatest enemy.
- lnspector Kiran.

532
01:01:33,772 --> 01:01:37,401
Did you call me, Madam?

533
01:01:37,475 --> 01:01:43,311
Do one thing. Take
these photographs.

534
01:01:43,381 --> 01:01:46,873
Send the copies to
all the Police stations.

535
01:01:46,985 --> 01:01:50,751
Today"s the New Year Eve...
it"s possible that...

536
01:01:50,822 --> 01:01:55,282
... at least one of
them is spotted somewhere.

537
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:59,763
A killer is following them.

538
01:02:19,818 --> 01:02:22,787
- Sapna, just a moment.
- Rajesh.

539
01:02:22,854 --> 01:02:28,554
- Rajesh... you?
- Sapna, where are you going?

540
01:02:28,627 --> 01:02:29,787
l was searching for you.

541
01:02:29,861 --> 01:02:32,591
Everyone in this world is
in search for something.

542
01:02:32,831 --> 01:02:36,494
Some reach their goal
... while some don"t.

543
01:02:36,568 --> 01:02:38,502
But why were you
searching for me?

544
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:43,234
You"ll feel the need
for a friend at times.

545
01:02:43,308 --> 01:02:45,799
- what happened?
- My daddy has been killed.

546
01:02:45,911 --> 01:02:48,402
l"m in search of his murderer.

547
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:52,576
The day l find him...
l won"t spare him.

548
01:02:52,851 --> 01:02:56,582
- what?
- will you meet me again?

549
01:02:56,855 --> 01:02:59,255
- Not today, let"s meet
tomorrow. - l"ll wait for you.

550
01:02:59,324 --> 01:03:01,554
- At the same place.
- Okay.

551
01:03:51,443 --> 01:03:52,933
Excuse me, this is mine.

552
01:03:53,011 --> 01:03:55,980
lt"s pretty.

553
01:03:56,047 --> 01:03:58,242
Even you are very pretty.

554
01:03:58,316 --> 01:04:01,911
Beauty can be disastrous too.

555
01:04:01,987 --> 01:04:08,153
l wouldn"t mind if my
doom is so beautiful!

556
01:04:42,293 --> 01:04:44,921
""You won"t be
able to hide from me""

557
01:04:44,996 --> 01:04:48,363
""No matter how much
you try to deceive me""

558
01:04:48,433 --> 01:04:51,231
""l"ll certainly meet the
person l"m searching for""

559
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:53,991
""where are you... you
gave me sleepless nights""

560
01:05:54,065 --> 01:05:57,728
""l"ve gone crazy about you""

561
01:06:05,043 --> 01:06:07,011
""How am l to find him""

562
01:06:07,078 --> 01:06:10,605
""l"m missing him so much""

563
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:45,540
""The one whom l loved deeply""

564
01:06:45,617 --> 01:06:49,849
""l"m in search for
that beloved of mine""

565
01:06:59,097 --> 01:07:01,588
""Now he"s right in front of me""

566
01:07:36,935 --> 01:07:39,733
""Twirling his bunch of keys""

567
01:07:39,804 --> 01:07:42,773
""He"s trying to woo me""

568
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:55,642
""He torments me every moment""

569
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,464
- You are a good dancer.
- Thanks for the compliment.

570
01:08:49,707 --> 01:08:52,938
Come beloved.... let"s
celebrate the New Year.

571
01:08:53,211 --> 01:08:55,372
why not?

572
01:08:56,214 --> 01:09:01,379
Madam, Ram here.

573
01:09:01,552 --> 01:09:05,454
l just spotted
Balram with a girl.

574
01:09:06,291 --> 01:09:09,920
He"s going with her to the room.

575
01:09:09,994 --> 01:09:12,690
l"m calling from
Hotel Hill Town.

576
01:09:12,764 --> 01:09:14,925
l"ll be there in a
moment. wait for me.

577
01:09:23,241 --> 01:09:25,368
This is my little home.

578
01:09:26,244 --> 01:09:27,871
what a beautiful house you have!

579
01:09:28,846 --> 01:09:33,010
The house is beautiful
as a well as you.

580
01:09:33,651 --> 01:09:38,213
Come. Sit.

581
01:09:45,663 --> 01:09:47,563
Don"t be in such a hurry.

582
01:09:48,266 --> 01:09:53,898
Or else you might get lost
forever.

583
01:09:55,273 --> 01:10:01,234
Come what may, but l will spend
this splendid night with you.

584
01:10:01,546 --> 01:10:04,037
whatever the consequences are.

585
01:10:11,689 --> 01:10:13,247
what is this?

586
01:10:15,693 --> 01:10:19,652
This is a weapon. And it is
not needed in this romance.

587
01:10:20,698 --> 01:10:22,063
l"ll keep it.

588
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:23,867
Happy now?

589
01:10:28,706 --> 01:10:34,872
l"ll get a peg to make
this night more splendid.

590
01:10:35,313 --> 01:10:37,679
l"ll be right back.

591
01:10:41,319 --> 01:10:44,584
- what are you doing?
- Celebrating the new year.

592
01:10:45,723 --> 01:10:50,092
Don"t laugh! You killed my
father lnspector Karma.

593
01:10:50,928 --> 01:10:53,954
l was waiting for this
since 12 years...

594
01:10:54,332 --> 01:10:59,770
... so that you beg
at my feet for mercy.

595
01:11:00,338 --> 01:11:04,104
And die a miserable death.

596
01:11:08,346 --> 01:11:11,315
Rana is the cause for all this.

597
01:11:11,949 --> 01:11:14,918
we are only his subordinates.

598
01:11:15,019 --> 01:11:17,715
l see! So you are his dogs?

599
01:11:17,955 --> 01:11:21,584
That is why a dog deserves
a dog"s death.

600
01:11:21,759 --> 01:11:25,718
l beg of you.
Spare me.

601
01:11:25,963 --> 01:11:27,931
l will spare you
on one condition.

602
01:11:28,366 --> 01:11:31,631
write as l tell you.
will you write?

603
01:11:31,769 --> 01:11:33,669
what are you thinking?

604
01:11:36,374 --> 01:11:37,341
Quick.

605
01:11:39,777 --> 01:11:43,338
write. l am penancing
for my sins.

606
01:11:44,782 --> 01:11:47,342
l am penancing for my sins.

607
01:11:48,386 --> 01:11:51,549
l am committing suicide.

608
01:12:00,398 --> 01:12:02,525
- Let me go now.
- Sure.

609
01:12:03,801 --> 01:12:07,032
The revolver contains
one bullet.

610
01:12:08,406 --> 01:12:09,703
l don"t know where.

611
01:12:10,408 --> 01:12:14,174
Now let"s see who lives
and who dies.

612
01:12:15,813 --> 01:12:19,044
- Alright, first you try.
- Okay.

613
01:12:24,822 --> 01:12:26,380
Now it"s your turn.

614
01:12:27,825 --> 01:12:31,784
l can see the fear of death
on your face. Don"t be afraid.

615
01:12:35,433 --> 01:12:36,695
You are saved.

616
01:12:41,839 --> 01:12:43,204
Now your turn again.

617
01:12:49,447 --> 01:12:51,210
Now only two rounds to go.

618
01:12:57,455 --> 01:12:59,423
- lt"s the last one now.
- Let me go.

619
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:00,684
Forgive me.

620
01:13:49,507 --> 01:13:51,270
- You?
- Yes, it"s me.

621
01:13:51,909 --> 01:13:56,744
- what are you doing here?
- l"m doing 2 things at a time.

622
01:13:56,914 --> 01:14:01,783
- what? - l"m starting my
motorbike, and... - And?

623
01:14:01,852 --> 01:14:03,285
l"m chewing a gum.

624
01:14:03,521 --> 01:14:05,284
l warned you that so late
at night, ...

625
01:14:05,523 --> 01:14:09,527
lf you want to warn,
go and warn those ...

626
01:14:09,527 --> 01:14:13,224
... who compelled me
to wander in the nights.

627
01:14:13,931 --> 01:14:18,994
l"ve wandered in the darkness
so much,that now l hate the sun.

628
01:14:20,137 --> 01:14:23,766
Your words have pain
and hatred in them.

629
01:14:24,542 --> 01:14:26,009
what had you gone through?

630
01:14:26,544 --> 01:14:29,513
Tell me. Perhaps
l could help you.

631
01:14:29,947 --> 01:14:33,551
l am not like a flower who
tells its story to everyone ...

632
01:14:33,551 --> 01:14:34,916
... through its fragrance.

633
01:14:35,553 --> 01:14:40,320
l am like a thorn who never
shared its sorrow with anyone.

634
01:14:41,559 --> 01:14:44,995
Anyway, forget it. would you
like to have chewing gum?

635
01:14:45,563 --> 01:14:50,125
- No. - Okay, l"ll leave.

636
01:14:51,569 --> 01:14:52,831
Take care.

637
01:14:56,574 --> 01:14:59,270
Even you chew a gum
like my younger sister.

638
01:14:59,577 --> 01:15:02,341
wish you were my younger sister.

639
01:15:33,242 --> 01:15:35,107
Looks like he committed suicide.

640
01:15:42,051 --> 01:15:44,417
- Constable. - Yes?
- Send the body for post mortem.

641
01:15:49,659 --> 01:15:54,892
The killer managed to kill ...

642
01:15:55,665 --> 01:15:59,226
... our two friends so easy.

643
01:15:59,335 --> 01:16:03,294
You have not experienced
my strength.

644
01:16:03,673 --> 01:16:07,905
- when l ...
- Shut up, you fool!

645
01:16:08,678 --> 01:16:12,949
Had God given you
some brains too,...

646
01:16:12,949 --> 01:16:17,147
... our friends wouldn"t
die so miserably.

647
01:16:19,288 --> 01:16:24,093
l have so much brains,...

648
01:16:24,093 --> 01:16:27,654
... that all the street dogs
imitate me.

649
01:16:28,097 --> 01:16:32,932
Except that delicate darling
Kiran.

650
01:16:33,102 --> 01:16:38,472
l will teach her
such a lesson ...

651
01:16:38,708 --> 01:16:45,136
... that you will be stunned.

652
01:16:45,715 --> 01:16:47,842
And if you don"t teach
her a lesson,...

653
01:16:48,718 --> 01:16:51,687
... you have already
lost your eyesight.

654
01:16:52,321 --> 01:16:56,726
l will make your condition
such that ...

655
01:16:56,726 --> 01:17:00,492
... you will be left
good for nothing.

656
01:17:00,730 --> 01:17:01,958
what are you saying?

657
01:17:02,198 --> 01:17:04,689
Sir, take a look at
Balram"s photo.

658
01:17:06,135 --> 01:17:10,094
lt clearly shows that
he did not commit suicide.

659
01:17:10,339 --> 01:17:11,499
He was murdered.

660
01:17:12,141 --> 01:17:15,110
This time you failed.

661
01:17:15,745 --> 01:17:20,375
lt"s clear from this photo
that he shot himself.

662
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:23,045
l don"t believe
this is a murder.

663
01:17:23,352 --> 01:17:26,378
Sir, take out your gun.

664
01:17:26,756 --> 01:17:28,053
Please.

665
01:17:33,763 --> 01:17:35,993
Now aim it on your temple.

666
01:17:39,769 --> 01:17:41,737
Sir, why did you hold it
on the right side?

667
01:17:42,038 --> 01:17:43,733
To die, one aims
on the left side.

668
01:17:45,174 --> 01:17:46,732
- Like this? - Yes.

669
01:17:47,777 --> 01:17:51,280
No one will hold the gun
in the right hand ...

670
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,248
... and aim it
on the left temple.

671
01:17:54,183 --> 01:17:57,016
That"s what l want to tell you.

672
01:17:57,186 --> 01:17:59,154
See the photo carefully.

673
01:17:59,288 --> 01:18:02,155
He is holding the gun
in his right hand.

674
01:18:02,258 --> 01:18:04,351
And the bullet was
shot on the left side.

675
01:18:07,196 --> 01:18:08,561
You"re right.

676
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:15,034
This means the murderer
first killed Balram.

677
01:18:16,205 --> 01:18:19,208
To make the murder look
like a suicide ...

678
01:18:19,208 --> 01:18:22,575
.... he made him hold
the gun in his right hand.

679
01:18:24,814 --> 01:18:26,179
Then who could be the murder?

680
01:18:27,216 --> 01:18:30,982
They were four friends.
Two of them are murdered.

681
01:18:31,821 --> 01:18:34,255
But it was make to look like
an accident.

682
01:18:34,824 --> 01:18:36,587
The other two are yet
to be murdered.

683
01:18:37,827 --> 01:18:40,387
The murderer
could be one of them.

684
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:42,320
Keep a strict watch
on both of them.

685
01:18:48,104 --> 01:18:53,474
ls she avenging her father"s
death, deceiving the police?

686
01:19:18,467 --> 01:19:22,164
You have obliged me by saving
my life for the second time.

687
01:19:22,872 --> 01:19:24,840
l have not done any favour.

688
01:19:26,275 --> 01:19:29,836
Actually, l hate the police.

689
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:35,249
l saved your life,
because you are a noble person.

690
01:19:46,295 --> 01:19:47,262
Excuse me.

691
01:19:48,898 --> 01:19:50,661
You dropped your purse.

692
01:19:55,304 --> 01:19:58,467
You have obliged me
by returning this purse.

693
01:19:59,242 --> 01:20:05,545
Had l lost this, l would
have no reason to live.

694
01:20:06,916 --> 01:20:10,682
l think you are overburdened
by sorrows.

695
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:14,284
why don"t you share your sorrow
with me?

696
01:20:14,924 --> 01:20:17,484
Perhaps it might lighten
the burden.

697
01:20:17,927 --> 01:20:20,361
Tell me, what is your plight?

698
01:20:20,930 --> 01:20:22,295
You want to know?

699
01:20:27,937 --> 01:20:29,905
Reshmi, have you gone crazy?

700
01:20:30,339 --> 01:20:33,035
You shouldn"t fetch water in
this condition. l would do it.

701
01:20:33,342 --> 01:20:35,902
why should you fetch water,
when l am there?

702
01:20:36,946 --> 01:20:40,905
l don"t want our child
to be caused any harm.

703
01:20:41,951 --> 01:20:43,714
Leave it there.
Come and sit here.

704
01:20:44,954 --> 01:20:46,512
You didn"t even have the milk.

705
01:20:49,959 --> 01:20:53,588
- what happened? - You need
to drink milk, not me.

706
01:20:54,363 --> 01:20:57,730
Have two glasses. One for
you and one for my child.

707
01:20:58,567 --> 01:21:00,091
- l"m going to office.
- But ...

708
01:21:00,303 --> 01:21:02,271
Don"t fetch any more water now.

709
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:14,447
Oh God!
what an ill-omen!

710
01:21:14,984 --> 01:21:19,751
Oh God! Protect him.

711
01:21:53,022 --> 01:21:55,786
Sorry, young man.
This happened all of a sudden.

712
01:21:56,359 --> 01:22:00,429
- Are you alright? - The
documents in this briefcase ...

713
01:22:00,429 --> 01:22:04,991
... have to be handed over to
the Chief Minister at any cost.

714
01:22:06,035 --> 01:22:07,593
How can l leave you
in this condition?

715
01:22:09,038 --> 01:22:11,598
l can give up my life
for this country.

716
01:22:12,041 --> 01:22:15,306
l request you to hand over these
documents to the Chief Minister.

717
01:22:15,444 --> 01:22:17,412
lt is very urgent.

718
01:22:17,646 --> 01:22:21,810
- How will he identify me?
- Here"s my identity card.

719
01:22:23,452 --> 01:22:25,613
No one will stop you
if you show this.

720
01:23:15,504 --> 01:23:17,665
Hey mister, where are you going?
whom do you want to meet?

721
01:23:18,107 --> 01:23:20,667
- l want to meet the CM.
- what"s the matter?

722
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:23,712
A man met with an accident.
He requested me ...

723
01:23:23,712 --> 01:23:25,873
... to give this briefcase
to the CM.

724
01:23:26,115 --> 01:23:27,480
Okay.

725
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:54,143
Today"s headlines.
Terrorist Shiva under arrest.

726
01:23:54,143 --> 01:23:56,111
40 personnel killed
along with the CM.

727
01:23:58,147 --> 01:24:00,911
- You must read it.
- Give change. - Give me one.

728
01:24:01,150 --> 01:24:04,119
lt"s a sensational news.
Buy it.

729
01:24:05,154 --> 01:24:06,917
Today"s headlines!

730
01:24:09,158 --> 01:24:13,390
40 personnel killed along with
the CM. Shiva arrested.

731
01:24:15,564 --> 01:24:18,260
From all the evidences and
witnesses, it has been proved...

732
01:24:18,434 --> 01:24:21,170
... that along with the CM,
40 government employees ...

733
01:24:21,170 --> 01:24:24,799
... were killed
in the bomb blast.

734
01:24:26,575 --> 01:24:29,645
Your honour,
l request the court ...

735
01:24:29,645 --> 01:24:33,182
... that accused Shiva
should be severely punished ...

736
01:24:33,182 --> 01:24:35,946
... for betraying the country.

737
01:24:36,185 --> 01:24:39,951
So that all the traitors
learn a lesson.

738
01:24:40,189 --> 01:24:42,749
Do you want to say anything
in your defence?

739
01:24:43,192 --> 01:24:45,694
All what l want to say is,...

740
01:24:45,694 --> 01:24:47,161
... that l am innocent.

741
01:24:48,197 --> 01:24:50,757
Only the inspector is
responsible for everything.

742
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,802
ln an injured condition,
he gave me some documents ...

743
01:24:53,802 --> 01:24:55,770
... to be given to the CM.

744
01:24:57,206 --> 01:25:00,505
The moment l delivered the
suitcase, the bomb blasted.

745
01:25:01,210 --> 01:25:02,973
lt"s not my fault.

746
01:25:03,212 --> 01:25:07,444
The accused has been shown
the photos of all the policemen.

747
01:25:07,816 --> 01:25:10,649
But he did not identify anyone.

748
01:25:12,221 --> 01:25:16,453
lt is clear that he has
cooked up this story.

749
01:25:16,825 --> 01:25:19,191
And it is far from reality.

750
01:25:20,729 --> 01:25:23,994
He is a traitor.

751
01:25:26,235 --> 01:25:31,195
And so l request you to
punish him severely.

752
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:34,200
You do everything for money.

753
01:25:34,643 --> 01:25:40,809
You change the facts and send
the innocent to the gallows.

754
01:25:40,916 --> 01:25:43,350
And save the culprits.

755
01:25:44,253 --> 01:25:50,817
Today it is proved
that Law is really blind.

756
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:53,023
which believes others.

757
01:25:53,862 --> 01:25:57,628
But don"t forget that
there"s one more court above.

758
01:25:58,667 --> 01:26:03,900
His justice can
destroy you and your law.

759
01:26:05,274 --> 01:26:08,038
Punish me. l am ready for it.

760
01:26:08,544 --> 01:26:14,915
This court sentences accused
Shiva to life imprisonment.

761
01:26:30,699 --> 01:26:33,065
Didn"t get the baby with you?

762
01:26:36,705 --> 01:26:38,070
How is she?

763
01:26:40,309 --> 01:26:41,537
why don"t you speak?

764
01:26:44,313 --> 01:26:45,541
Don"t cry, Reshmi.

765
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:54,084
Calm down.

766
01:26:57,726 --> 01:26:59,284
Even l will lose courage.

767
01:27:00,329 --> 01:27:03,298
There"s nothing to lose now.

768
01:27:04,333 --> 01:27:07,962
Had you brought the baby,
l could have seen her once.

769
01:27:10,939 --> 01:27:16,605
l poisoned her to death.

770
01:27:20,349 --> 01:27:21,714
what are you saying, Reshmi?

771
01:27:22,751 --> 01:27:26,118
why did you kill her?

772
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:36,865
ln this cruel world, the girl
who does not have ...

773
01:27:36,865 --> 01:27:41,598
... the shelter of her father,
she has to suffer.

774
01:27:43,772 --> 01:27:48,377
l didn"t want my daughter to
become a victim ...

775
01:27:48,377 --> 01:27:51,141
... to the evil world.

776
01:27:52,781 --> 01:27:56,148
That is why l killed her.

777
01:27:57,786 --> 01:28:00,346
l killed her!

778
01:28:04,059 --> 01:28:07,085
very good!

779
01:28:09,398 --> 01:28:12,959
You did the right thing. She
is lucky that she is no more.

780
01:28:15,404 --> 01:28:17,167
You take care of yourself.

781
01:28:17,806 --> 01:28:19,171
Take care of yourself
for my sake.

782
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:24,877
- l will.
- Take care.

783
01:28:29,818 --> 01:28:31,649
l will take care of myself.

784
01:28:37,826 --> 01:28:40,095
l was sentenced to
a life imprisonment ...

785
01:28:40,095 --> 01:28:42,996
... under the charge
of CM"s murder.

786
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:52,197
And suddenly the jail
where l was, caught fire.

787
01:28:53,842 --> 01:28:58,575
l put my life at stake and
save jailer and his daughter.

788
01:29:00,048 --> 01:29:04,075
The government pardoned
my punishment.

789
01:29:05,854 --> 01:29:07,412
l was released.

790
01:29:08,857 --> 01:29:13,462
Since that day, with the feeling
of revenge in my heart, ...

791
01:29:13,462 --> 01:29:17,228
... l"m wandering
in search of that man ...

792
01:29:18,867 --> 01:29:21,097
... you played
this dirty prank with me.

793
01:29:23,806 --> 01:29:27,071
Do inform me,
when you find him.

794
01:29:27,476 --> 01:29:30,240
l will surely get him punished.

795
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:33,575
How will you get him punished?

796
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:38,246
Law can"t give him the
punishment, l want to give him.

797
01:29:39,955 --> 01:29:42,048
l will give his verdict.

798
01:29:45,994 --> 01:29:50,863
l would have
shot lnspector Kiran.

799
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:55,266
She would have been killed.

800
01:29:56,505 --> 01:29:59,975
l wonder from where that
scoundrel Shiva came,...

801
01:29:59,975 --> 01:30:01,636
... and saved her.

802
01:30:01,844 --> 01:30:04,913
Rana, is he the same Shiva ...

803
01:30:04,913 --> 01:30:10,146
... whom you had framed
in a bomb blast case?

804
01:30:12,521 --> 01:30:15,285
- How do you know?
- 12 years ago ...

805
01:30:15,524 --> 01:30:19,290
... l could see a little.

806
01:30:19,528 --> 01:30:22,759
And suddenly l read in the
newspaper ...

807
01:30:22,865 --> 01:30:27,536
... that Mr.Rana has framed
Shiva in a bomb blast case ...

808
01:30:27,536 --> 01:30:31,495
... and he was proved to be
a terrorist.

809
01:30:33,141 --> 01:30:38,306
l agree that l"m a wicked man.

810
01:30:38,547 --> 01:30:40,913
But you turned out to be
one step ahead of us.

811
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:44,553
l have conspired ...

812
01:30:44,553 --> 01:30:51,186
... to trap that police officer
in the clutches of law.

813
01:30:52,828 --> 01:30:58,528
Beware! Don"t try to act smart
or l"ll shoot you. Understand?

814
01:31:06,875 --> 01:31:10,504
- vijay, when did you come from
London? - Forget about that.

815
01:31:11,547 --> 01:31:14,107
lt"s been 25 years since
l came in this world.

816
01:31:14,550 --> 01:31:16,780
And in front of you, 25 seconds.

817
01:31:17,152 --> 01:31:19,985
- You scared the hell out of me.
- why should you be scared?

818
01:31:20,556 --> 01:31:23,525
My guru says don"t be scared
when you are in love.

819
01:31:42,978 --> 01:31:45,344
""Childhood was yet to go""

820
01:31:45,847 --> 01:31:48,680
""And youth was yet to come""

821
01:31:49,585 --> 01:31:52,145
""who is trying to woo my heart""

822
01:31:52,254 --> 01:31:54,950
"" Began to give me
sleepless nights""

823
01:32:00,596 --> 01:32:02,359
""Oh God, what"s wrong with me""

824
01:32:05,601 --> 01:32:11,164
""You are in love""

825
01:32:39,034 --> 01:32:41,867
""The doors to my heart
were closed""

826
01:32:42,237 --> 01:32:44,762
""Only you had a place in it""

827
01:32:55,050 --> 01:32:57,416
""Then who is tries to woo me""

828
01:32:57,653 --> 01:33:00,622
""Rob me of my sleep""

829
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:46,827
""l"ve never seen a beau like you""

830
01:33:47,703 --> 01:33:50,263
""There was never
such a season of love""

831
01:34:00,315 --> 01:34:02,943
""Everyone is trying to woo me""

832
01:34:03,719 --> 01:34:06,085
""Everyone is trying to pamper me""

833
01:35:11,787 --> 01:35:15,348
You have to deliver this letter
to the police commissioner.

834
01:35:16,091 --> 01:35:19,026
Since you are blind,
l"ll read it to you.

835
01:35:20,796 --> 01:35:23,560
lt reads.
Commissioner, ...

836
01:35:23,799 --> 01:35:26,201
... lnspector Kiran is hand
in gloves with the gang ...

837
01:35:26,201 --> 01:35:28,499
... who prints counterfeit
currency.

838
01:35:29,204 --> 01:35:34,476
And whoever gets a whiff
of it, she gets him killed...

839
01:35:34,476 --> 01:35:36,376
... and claims it to be
an accident.

840
01:35:37,813 --> 01:35:40,941
- That"s great.
- She is cheating the police.

841
01:35:41,149 --> 01:35:43,583
Shiva is supporting her
in this deed.

842
01:35:43,819 --> 01:35:47,823
Shiva who had been in prison
under the charge of ...

843
01:35:47,823 --> 01:35:50,951
... killing the CM in
a bomb blast 12 years ago.

844
01:35:51,426 --> 01:35:56,955
As a proof, l am sending
the two counterfeit notes.

845
01:35:57,833 --> 01:36:02,600
Take this letter
and these two notes.

846
01:36:02,838 --> 01:36:05,807
what have given in my hands?

847
01:36:07,843 --> 01:36:14,612
Rana, l am your friend.
Tell me which one is fake.

848
01:36:15,116 --> 01:36:19,610
You fool! we don"t mint notes.

849
01:36:20,255 --> 01:36:21,620
Both are real notes.

850
01:36:21,857 --> 01:36:25,156
l have played this trick
to mislead the police.

851
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:28,463
So that they arrest lnspector
Kiran under the charge ...

852
01:36:28,463 --> 01:36:30,158
... of printing
counterfeit notes.

853
01:36:35,470 --> 01:36:40,430
This is amazing. l can"t make
out which one of them is real.

854
01:36:42,277 --> 01:36:45,644
Send these notes
to Reserve Bank.

855
01:36:46,281 --> 01:36:47,646
For analysis.

856
01:36:48,350 --> 01:36:50,113
And arrest lnspector Kiran.

857
01:36:50,886 --> 01:36:55,846
She will be under custody
until the matter is clear.

858
01:37:03,899 --> 01:37:05,491
Sapna used to chew gums.

859
01:37:05,901 --> 01:37:07,459
She is my sister.

860
01:37:07,903 --> 01:37:11,202
She is killing our enemies
one by one.

861
01:37:11,907 --> 01:37:15,673
This mean the next target
will be Rana or Faslu.

862
01:37:16,912 --> 01:37:18,880
l will have to arrest my sister.

863
01:37:22,918 --> 01:37:23,885
Constable, come with me.

864
01:37:25,921 --> 01:37:28,481
You don"t need to go
anywhere, lnspector Kiran.

865
01:37:29,925 --> 01:37:32,485
Now onwards, you are under
police custody.

866
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:35,931
Because you are suspect for
being associated ...

867
01:37:35,931 --> 01:37:37,933
... with terrorist Shiva,
and you are killing ...

868
01:37:37,933 --> 01:37:41,164
... your father"s murderers
one by one.

869
01:37:42,537 --> 01:37:44,505
Sir, give me one chance.

870
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:48,205
l will trace the culprit
within 24 hours.

871
01:37:58,353 --> 01:38:03,518
Hey blindman,
lnspector Kiran is arrested.

872
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:07,228
All the plans she made
against us,...

873
01:38:07,228 --> 01:38:09,321
... are wasted.

874
01:38:09,965 --> 01:38:11,523
And the interesting thing is...

875
01:38:11,967 --> 01:38:15,926
... l have made Shiva
a terrorist.

876
01:38:16,371 --> 01:38:19,602
Now he must be wandering
everywhere to escape the police.

877
01:38:19,975 --> 01:38:22,535
You say excellent dialogues.

878
01:38:22,978 --> 01:38:28,075
You see to be a director
of some drama.

879
01:38:29,384 --> 01:38:31,545
You join the film industry.

880
01:38:31,987 --> 01:38:35,616
You"ll make a best villain.

881
01:38:35,991 --> 01:38:41,224
l can become the hero
if l want to.

882
01:38:41,997 --> 01:38:46,161
Because l am financing more
than half a films.

883
01:38:47,002 --> 01:38:48,765
That reminds me.

884
01:38:49,004 --> 01:38:50,767
The shooting is postponed.

885
01:38:51,406 --> 01:38:54,136
Deliver this to the studio.
l"m giving it in your hand.

886
01:38:54,609 --> 01:38:58,013
Listen, blindman. Deliver
it to the right place,...

887
01:38:58,013 --> 01:39:01,608
... or l"ll deliver
you to the right place.

888
01:39:02,017 --> 01:39:03,382
Don"t worry.

889
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:09,584
- Coming.
- Come, my support.

890
01:39:09,691 --> 01:39:11,784
what a strange blindman!

891
01:39:12,627 --> 01:39:14,595
Rakhi, you seem so attractive.

892
01:39:15,030 --> 01:39:18,796
Hurry up, we have to deliver
the money to Hyderabad Studio.

893
01:39:19,034 --> 01:39:20,797
l am blind after all.

894
01:39:21,036 --> 01:39:23,402
My darling!

895
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:29,409
l"m totally blind now.
May you go to hell!

896
01:39:34,649 --> 01:39:36,412
Here it is.

897
01:39:43,058 --> 01:39:47,358
You are my only support.

898
01:39:48,063 --> 01:39:50,031
Let"s go.

899
01:39:51,066 --> 01:39:54,297
Brother will be upset.

900
01:40:28,503 --> 01:40:33,566
""l won"t lend you a kiss""

901
01:40:34,109 --> 01:40:39,069
""Even if you offer me
U.P. or Bihar""

902
01:41:13,148 --> 01:41:17,448
""l have many admirers like
you who only sing my praise""

903
01:41:27,562 --> 01:41:32,397
""l won"t take you in my arms""

904
01:41:32,667 --> 01:41:37,934
""Even if you offer me
U.P. or Bihar""

905
01:41:59,594 --> 01:42:02,757
""From Delhi l came to Patna
and then to Kolkatta""

906
01:42:03,198 --> 01:42:06,497
"" But l didn"t find a lover""

907
01:42:16,211 --> 01:42:20,773
""why should l give my youth
to you""

908
01:42:40,235 --> 01:42:43,534
""Only l know what is
in your mind""

909
01:42:43,838 --> 01:42:47,001
""l know what kind of a man
you are""

910
01:42:59,587 --> 01:43:04,490
""How can l give you
my peace of mind""

911
01:43:24,879 --> 01:43:26,870
Mr.Faslu, good
that you came on time.

912
01:43:26,948 --> 01:43:29,246
l was eagerly waiting for you.

913
01:43:29,684 --> 01:43:33,051
Bashir Babbar, may
your enemies die.

914
01:43:35,290 --> 01:43:36,917
- Rakhi! - Yes?

915
01:43:37,292 --> 01:43:41,251
Open the briefcase
and show him the money.

916
01:43:41,562 --> 01:43:43,587
- Take it.
- Can l count it?

917
01:43:43,698 --> 01:43:45,666
Don"t count it.
lt will be an insult to Bhai.

918
01:43:46,301 --> 01:43:51,068
l am giving you Rs. 2 million.

919
01:43:51,306 --> 01:43:52,671
- There"s a problem.
- what happened?

920
01:43:52,907 --> 01:43:57,071
The villain has met with an
accident. He just called up.

921
01:43:57,312 --> 01:43:59,280
Now what? we will have to
cancel the shooting.

922
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:02,540
The shooting will be canceled?!

923
01:44:03,718 --> 01:44:07,620
So what if he didn"t come.
The villain is before you.

924
01:44:08,323 --> 01:44:12,453
l am bald. But l do
look like a villain.

925
01:44:14,729 --> 01:44:16,697
- Give him a chance.
He seems fit. - Okay.

926
01:44:17,332 --> 01:44:18,697
You can do this role.

927
01:44:20,335 --> 01:44:24,704
l knew you would
surely offer the role to me.

928
01:44:25,340 --> 01:44:28,605
Read the story line to me.

929
01:44:29,344 --> 01:44:32,472
First listen to the scene
l am going to shoot.

930
01:44:32,747 --> 01:44:35,648
- Okay. - You will play
a shoe thief in this film.

931
01:44:37,352 --> 01:44:41,311
Did you hear that? l will play
the role of a shoe thief.

932
01:44:43,358 --> 01:44:48,455
That reminds me of my childhood.

933
01:44:49,364 --> 01:44:52,060
when l was passing from
a mosque,...

934
01:44:52,367 --> 01:44:56,133
...people went to offer prayers,
and l stole their shoes.

935
01:44:56,704 --> 01:44:59,730
lf l went to the temple, l
stole shoes there too.

936
01:45:00,375 --> 01:45:03,936
l would sell the shoes
in the market.

937
01:45:04,379 --> 01:45:08,008
By God"s grace
l would survive on it.

938
01:45:08,383 --> 01:45:11,147
By God"s grace, l found an
original character for my film.

939
01:45:11,386 --> 01:45:13,354
Congratulation.

940
01:45:14,389 --> 01:45:18,348
You are running. You are
wearing diamond studded shoes.

941
01:45:18,993 --> 01:45:22,156
And you face a girl whom you
had raped 10 years ago.

942
01:45:22,730 --> 01:45:25,358
- l got it.
- Then get ready for the shoot.

943
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:29,759
- l"m ready.
- And that girl shoots you.

944
01:45:30,405 --> 01:45:33,966
- Shoots me? - Yes, thrice.
- Shoots Rana"s man?

945
01:45:35,410 --> 01:45:37,503
- what am l hearing?
- The bullets will be fake.

946
01:45:37,678 --> 01:45:39,168
And even the blood
will be false.

947
01:45:39,414 --> 01:45:42,042
You will die a false death.
Films are never real.

948
01:45:42,417 --> 01:45:45,181
l"ll experience it.
Call the make-up man.

949
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:47,980
Ask the dress man
to get the revolver.

950
01:45:48,423 --> 01:45:50,391
- Get the revolver.
- Yes, sir.

951
01:45:53,027 --> 01:45:56,190
- Hey, forget that.
First get some tea. - Yes, sir.

952
01:46:01,836 --> 01:46:04,669
- Madam, tea. - No thanks.
- Sir, would you have?

953
01:46:12,447 --> 01:46:14,813
- Sir, get ready.
- Let me get dressed first.

954
01:46:29,063 --> 01:46:30,223
Sir, the shot is ready.

955
01:46:31,466 --> 01:46:34,765
- The shot is ready.
- Don"t you have any manners?

956
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:39,562
You talk so impolitely
with Rana"s person?

957
01:46:39,874 --> 01:46:44,777
l"m your film"s main villain.
Mind your tongue.

958
01:46:44,879 --> 01:46:47,245
Don"t be emotional, Faslu.

959
01:46:47,482 --> 01:46:50,747
- Please come, sir. The shot
is ready. - Okay.

960
01:46:53,488 --> 01:46:56,048
- Sir, here"s the gun.
- Did you load it? - Yes.

961
01:46:57,492 --> 01:47:00,859
Here"s the gun. Aim it
as the shoe thief.

962
01:47:02,096 --> 01:47:03,859
The light is not enough
for the shooting.

963
01:47:04,499 --> 01:47:06,797
There"s not enough light.
How will we take the shot?

964
01:47:07,502 --> 01:47:10,130
l wonder what"s wrong today.

965
01:47:12,106 --> 01:47:15,667
wow! what a story!

966
01:47:16,511 --> 01:47:18,979
And what a toy you have brought!

967
01:47:21,516 --> 01:47:27,477
lf l aim this on my temple,
my brains will burst out.

968
01:47:28,523 --> 01:47:32,823
And if it is aimed on the
chest, my heart will tear open.

969
01:47:35,530 --> 01:47:38,294
Try this toy.

970
01:47:41,536 --> 01:47:45,495
No! You might press
the trigger. lt"s just a toy.

971
01:47:46,941 --> 01:47:52,777
l want to see
how you kill the villain.

972
01:47:53,548 --> 01:47:55,516
Please show it to me.

973
01:47:56,150 --> 01:47:58,118
Be careful.

974
01:47:58,553 --> 01:48:03,513
Don"t hesitate.
Aim at my temple.

975
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:09,519
Madam, what are you doing?
The bullets are very expensive.

976
01:48:09,964 --> 01:48:12,990
Don"t waste them. She is
a superstar, she will do it.

977
01:48:13,167 --> 01:48:15,931
Alright, let"s wait
for the light.

978
01:48:16,170 --> 01:48:17,330
when will the light come?

979
01:48:19,574 --> 01:48:21,337
Sir, you may do the shooting now.

980
01:48:21,576 --> 01:48:24,340
- Let"s go.
- Please come, madam.

981
01:48:24,579 --> 01:48:26,547
Darling, just watch me now.

982
01:48:28,583 --> 01:48:30,676
l"ve become a villain!

983
01:48:30,851 --> 01:48:32,148
Sir, take your position.

984
01:48:32,587 --> 01:48:36,546
- Say this dialogue.
- l understood.

985
01:48:36,857 --> 01:48:38,222
l"m Bhai"s person.

986
01:48:50,605 --> 01:48:53,369
- Don"t clap. lt was real.
- He acts so well.

987
01:48:58,613 --> 01:49:00,376
lt turned out to be real.

988
01:49:02,617 --> 01:49:04,585
He is a very nice actor.

989
01:49:06,220 --> 01:49:08,586
l think he is dead.

990
01:49:11,626 --> 01:49:14,186
No. How is that possible?

991
01:49:14,629 --> 01:49:17,189
lnspector Kiran is in jail.

992
01:49:17,632 --> 01:49:21,090
How could she kill that
blind man Faslu? lmpossible!

993
01:49:26,641 --> 01:49:31,646
The way lnspector Khan had
released us from jail ...

994
01:49:31,646 --> 01:49:36,879
... for a short while so that we
could kill lnspector Karma.

995
01:49:37,652 --> 01:49:40,212
And he put us in the lock up
after committing the murder.

996
01:49:40,655 --> 01:49:43,419
Similarly, lnspector Kiran...
No!

997
01:49:46,060 --> 01:49:50,429
lt"s me.
You have to kill the CM again.

998
01:49:50,665 --> 01:49:54,032
The same bomb blast.
Don"t worry about money.

999
01:49:55,269 --> 01:49:56,793
Your job will be done.

1000
01:49:57,938 --> 01:50:03,035
Nowadays nothing is impossible.

1001
01:50:03,344 --> 01:50:07,440
Only money is important.
Pay and watch the blast.

1002
01:50:15,089 --> 01:50:18,820
According to the Reserve Bank
report, both the notes are real.

1003
01:50:18,959 --> 01:50:20,449
You are innocent.

1004
01:50:22,697 --> 01:50:24,460
You may join your duty
from tomorrow.

1005
01:50:25,099 --> 01:50:29,934
Now watch how l expose
the real culprits.

1006
01:50:47,722 --> 01:50:49,690
She is asking for a lift.
Sure.

1007
01:50:51,325 --> 01:50:54,692
- Yes? - My bike broke down.
Please drop me ahead.

1008
01:50:56,731 --> 01:51:00,497
Even l was going that way.
we"ll have a good time.

1009
01:51:02,737 --> 01:51:04,967
- By the way, what"s your name?
- Sapna.

1010
01:51:05,139 --> 01:51:07,107
Nice name. My name is vijay.

1011
01:51:07,742 --> 01:51:11,508
- Are you married? - No.
- Same here.

1012
01:51:11,746 --> 01:51:15,204
- l have a girl friend. - Really?
- Do you have a boyfriend? - No.

1013
01:51:16,150 --> 01:51:18,380
Anyway. By the way,
where are you going?

1014
01:51:18,753 --> 01:51:21,187
- Just a little further.
- Okay.

1015
01:51:27,762 --> 01:51:30,128
l enjoy traveling
since childhood.

1016
01:51:30,364 --> 01:51:34,528
l go anywhere around the world.

1017
01:51:38,773 --> 01:51:41,139
Hey, watch out!

1018
01:51:54,188 --> 01:51:56,383
Please get up.
l"ll reach you to the hospital.

1019
01:51:56,791 --> 01:52:00,249
Don"t worry about me. This bag
has to be delivered to the CM.

1020
01:52:00,795 --> 01:52:03,355
Because it contains
very important documents.

1021
01:52:04,064 --> 01:52:06,157
Don"t worry at all.

1022
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:08,561
l can lay my life
for the country.

1023
01:52:08,803 --> 01:52:11,567
l will deliver this bag
to the CM at any cost.

1024
01:52:13,207 --> 01:52:15,038
But how will he identify me?

1025
01:52:15,810 --> 01:52:18,244
Take my identity card.
No one will stop you there.

1026
01:52:23,417 --> 01:52:25,044
l"ll deliver this bag to the CM.

1027
01:52:32,827 --> 01:52:34,192
whom do you work for?

1028
01:52:38,833 --> 01:52:40,061
won"t you speak up?

1029
01:52:42,837 --> 01:52:46,796
- whom do you work for?
- l don"t know anything.

1030
01:52:47,241 --> 01:52:51,200
Really?
Open the newspaper.

1031
01:52:55,249 --> 01:52:57,809
Do you know him?

1032
01:52:58,118 --> 01:53:02,578
- l"ll shoot you.
- Yes. l work for him.

1033
01:53:02,857 --> 01:53:05,223
Come with me.

1034
01:53:16,871 --> 01:53:18,839
Rana, now your game is over.

1035
01:53:24,879 --> 01:53:27,006
Listen to what l have to say.

1036
01:53:27,882 --> 01:53:30,442
very cleverly, you killed
my three friends.

1037
01:53:30,551 --> 01:53:33,179
But you cannot harm me.

1038
01:53:34,488 --> 01:53:36,891
Like the climax of every
film, in this climax too...

1039
01:53:36,891 --> 01:53:40,190
... your mother
is in my custody.

1040
01:53:41,295 --> 01:53:44,355
And she will live
till l am alive.

1041
01:53:51,906 --> 01:53:55,467
Just find out from where
the call was made.

1042
01:53:55,576 --> 01:53:56,873
Just a moment.

1043
01:54:04,919 --> 01:54:05,886
Okay.

1044
01:54:09,323 --> 01:54:11,883
Madam, the call was made from
Rana Farmhouse, Khandala.

1045
01:54:20,935 --> 01:54:22,937
Your daughter
joined the police force...

1046
01:54:22,937 --> 01:54:28,398
... only so that she could
avenge her father"s death.

1047
01:54:29,543 --> 01:54:33,309
And she killed my three friends.

1048
01:54:34,949 --> 01:54:36,712
But she cannot cause me any harm.

1049
01:54:37,217 --> 01:54:41,176
Because if she comes here
to seek revenge ...

1050
01:54:41,956 --> 01:54:44,959
... and when she sees you
in my custody ...

1051
01:54:44,959 --> 01:54:46,722
... her anger will subside.

1052
01:54:47,227 --> 01:54:51,721
And she will become helpless.

1053
01:54:51,966 --> 01:54:54,526
You committed several sins.

1054
01:54:55,569 --> 01:55:00,939
You will surely die,
no matter how.

1055
01:55:03,978 --> 01:55:06,538
l will die later. First...

1056
01:55:13,988 --> 01:55:16,957
Look how scared she is.
The death is yet to arrive.

1057
01:55:20,995 --> 01:55:23,361
Come, l"ll explain to you
what you have to do.

1058
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,299
Did you understand
what l explained to you?

1059
01:55:30,004 --> 01:55:32,370
- Do as you are told.
- Okay. - You may go.

1060
01:55:35,009 --> 01:55:38,968
Hey you! l had sent you
to kill the CM.

1061
01:55:39,413 --> 01:55:43,975
How come you are at my feet?

1062
01:55:45,019 --> 01:55:46,247
Look.

1063
01:55:54,028 --> 01:55:54,995
You?!

1064
01:55:56,030 --> 01:55:57,395
How come you are here?

1065
01:55:57,531 --> 01:55:59,999
Today Shiva has come
to do justice.

1066
01:56:00,634 --> 01:56:03,797
You mean you will punish Rana?!

1067
01:56:04,438 --> 01:56:05,803
You have wronged me.

1068
01:56:07,041 --> 01:56:09,509
You are responsible
for my daughter"s death.

1069
01:56:11,045 --> 01:56:13,172
You killed my wife.

1070
01:56:16,050 --> 01:56:18,814
l sentence you to death.

1071
01:56:19,453 --> 01:56:22,479
l"m happy to hear your verdict.

1072
01:56:23,657 --> 01:56:28,026
But perhaps you are unaware that
you are surrounded by mines.

1073
01:56:29,063 --> 01:56:35,627
One step forward,
and you will turn into ashes.

1074
01:56:36,070 --> 01:56:38,197
l"m prepared to die.

1075
01:56:38,705 --> 01:56:40,832
These mines cannot cause me
any harm.

1076
01:56:41,542 --> 01:56:44,443
- Escape if you can.
- Kill him.

1077
01:56:58,092 --> 01:57:00,856
lt was fun.

1078
01:57:01,495 --> 01:57:03,861
He wanted to do justice, indeed!

1079
01:57:04,498 --> 01:57:06,864
He will turn to ashes.

1080
01:57:07,101 --> 01:57:08,466
Scoundrel!

1081
01:57:15,509 --> 01:57:18,069
He is alive.

1082
01:57:21,115 --> 01:57:25,814
He shouldn"t escape.
Kill him!

1083
01:58:05,159 --> 01:58:07,389
Go and kill Shiva.

1084
01:58:07,561 --> 01:58:09,426
Old woman! Come on, move.

1085
01:58:25,779 --> 01:58:28,748
- Come on, old lady.
- Rana, let my mother go.

1086
01:58:28,849 --> 01:58:30,817
And surrender yourself
to the police.

1087
01:58:31,185 --> 01:58:33,312
l knew you would come.

1088
01:58:34,188 --> 01:58:36,952
Because a daughter would surely
come to rescue her mother.

1089
01:58:37,591 --> 01:58:38,956
Move out of my way.

1090
01:58:39,193 --> 01:58:42,959
Or l"ll shoot you
and your mother.

1091
01:58:44,198 --> 01:58:45,426
Stop, Rana!

1092
01:58:45,866 --> 01:58:48,468
lf you shoot this helpless
woman,...

1093
01:58:48,468 --> 01:58:51,437
... l will kill you.

1094
01:58:52,606 --> 01:58:55,507
why will you shoot me?
what enmity do you have with me?

1095
01:58:56,210 --> 01:59:00,579
- who are you? - l"m lnspector
Karma"s daughter Sapna.

1096
01:59:05,819 --> 01:59:07,980
which means even
she is your daughter.

1097
01:59:08,222 --> 01:59:12,454
Remembered, whom you had killed?

1098
01:59:13,827 --> 01:59:16,796
l have killed all your friends.

1099
01:59:17,231 --> 01:59:18,994
lt is your turn now.

1100
01:59:20,634 --> 01:59:22,602
You can"t escape today.

1101
01:59:24,238 --> 01:59:26,365
Even you can"t escape, madam.
Give me the gun.

1102
01:59:30,244 --> 01:59:33,008
Hey, come here.
Take her gun.

1103
01:59:34,648 --> 01:59:37,344
lt is not meant for kids.
lt can kill a person.

1104
01:59:37,884 --> 01:59:41,217
Go and meet your daughter.

1105
01:59:41,655 --> 01:59:44,215
- Go and meet your sister.
- Come, mother.

1106
01:59:45,259 --> 01:59:46,521
Meet to your heart"s content.

1107
01:59:48,262 --> 01:59:51,026
- Mother! - My child!
- My sister!

1108
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:56,228
Embrace each other.

1109
01:59:56,870 --> 02:00:03,241
Because there won"t be anyone
to cry over your death.

1110
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:10,646
welcome!
Meet him.

1111
02:00:11,285 --> 02:00:12,650
Her name is Sapna.

1112
02:00:15,289 --> 02:00:18,258
She is the one
who killed your father.

1113
02:00:19,693 --> 02:00:22,296
l see! The girl whom l loved
and wanted to marry ...

1114
02:00:22,296 --> 02:00:26,062
... is my father"s killer.

1115
02:00:26,700 --> 02:00:28,565
Give it to me.
l won"t spare her.

1116
02:00:33,307 --> 02:00:35,741
- what is this?
- l will surely shoot.

1117
02:00:35,909 --> 02:00:38,070
Not her, but you.

1118
02:00:42,716 --> 02:00:44,479
Because l know the truth.

1119
02:00:44,718 --> 02:00:47,551
l came to know today
how wicked my father was.

1120
02:00:47,721 --> 02:00:49,780
l regret that l came to know
this after his death.

1121
02:00:49,923 --> 02:00:52,084
Or else l would have shot
him right now.

1122
02:01:14,348 --> 02:01:15,576
Don"t move.

1123
02:01:18,352 --> 02:01:19,717
Look carefully.

1124
02:01:19,953 --> 02:01:23,582
l have won.
You all the defeated.

1125
02:01:24,358 --> 02:01:26,826
Now l will kill you one by one.

1126
02:01:27,361 --> 02:01:30,592
But first of all,
this old woman will die.

1127
02:02:16,410 --> 02:02:17,638
You scoundrel!

1128
02:02:39,833 --> 02:02:40,800
Get up!

1129
02:03:00,454 --> 02:03:01,819
l won"t spare you today.

1130
02:03:19,473 --> 02:03:21,236
Stop, Shiva! Don"t take
the law in your hands.

1131
02:03:23,477 --> 02:03:26,241
Stop, Shiva!
He is my target.

1132
02:03:40,894 --> 02:03:42,259
He is dead.

1133
02:03:42,896 --> 02:03:47,856
Sister, Shiva"s judgment
has completed my revenge.

1134
02:03:49,102 --> 02:03:53,198
Now l am ready to surrender
to the police.

1135
02:04:04,918 --> 02:04:07,079
Shiva has made his judgment.

1136
02:04:08,522 --> 02:04:10,888
You may fulfill your duty now.

1137
02:04:11,525 --> 02:04:14,494
Come and arrest me.
