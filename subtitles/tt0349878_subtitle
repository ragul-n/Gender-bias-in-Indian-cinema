1
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:37,494
You made me the Congress
President when I was in exiIe.

2
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:41,670
Now that I've won the eIection
on my own, you don't want me.

3
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,265
What's my mistake?

4
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,506
Each one has to Iisten
to his conscience, Subhas.

5
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:53,478
Do you think I'II not foIIow you?

6
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:56,486
Is that why I shouId resign?

7
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,687
If you foIIow the
party discipIine..

8
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,489
..and swear by non-vioIence..

9
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,332
..Congress can consider you.

10
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:10,333
I agree that non-vioIence was a
fine weapon once, Bapu (Gandhi).

11
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,462
But that was the time of peace.

12
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,269
Today, when the
worId is facing war..

13
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,003
..how can non-vioIence sustain?

14
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,403
I'm sad, Subhas.

15
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:25,945
Congress banned you
for this view point.

16
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,850
I've to endorse that.

17
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:33,291
Don't you think that..

18
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:36,419
..the worId war is a good
chance to defeat the British.

19
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:38,521
Wrong.

20
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,732
To kick an enemy when
he is down is wrong.

21
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,960
Wait, Iet the war end.

22
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,804
We can fight for
independence after that.

23
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:49,966
We heIped them in
the first worId war.

24
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:51,803
What was the return?

25
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,903
RowIett Act!

26
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:55,037
JaIianwaIa Bagh!

27
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,311
If we Iose this chance,
they wiII make..

28
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,944
..us their sIaves for ages.

29
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,352
This is no time to be siIent.

30
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:10,362
That's why I've appeaIed for
individuaI non-cooperation.

31
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:14,496
IndividuaI efforts
wiII Iead us nowhere.

32
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:17,460
AIright.

33
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:23,008
If you insist, we'II have to part.

34
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:25,536
Why are you saying this?

35
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:27,640
Are our goaIs not the same?

36
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,376
You cannot cut me off.

37
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:37,650
My Iove is both tender and rough.

38
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,825
You're a wayward
son of mine, Subhas.

39
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:48,596
AIthough I've Iost your respect but
my Iove for you remains the same..

40
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:52,034
..even though we're apart.

41
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,668
You said, Mahatma..

42
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,375
..even if one stands
aIone but is honest..

43
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,968
..he shouIdn't be
afraid to march forward.

44
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,114
I do not agree with you, Subhas.

45
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:09,379
But if your
methods make India free..

46
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:13,983
..I'II be the first
one to congratuIate you.

47
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,757
Then bIess me.

48
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:21,529
To succeed.

49
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,900
Greetings.
- Greetings.

50
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,034
A teIegram for you.

51
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,109
Putting me in jaiI is unjust.

52
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,080
So I've no aIternative.

53
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,120
But to register a moraI protest.

54
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:09,356
My fast unto death is to
wake up the powers in London.

55
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,692
Mr. Sisir, who wiII
have this Iunch?

56
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,297
Your uncIe is on a hunger strike.

57
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:16,826
Hunger strike?

58
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:20,235
Listen, Mr. Bose,
Its two weeks aIready.

59
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,072
I'II not aIIow you
to die Iike this.

60
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:24,835
PIease understand.

61
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,043
I'm not against you.

62
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,183
It's the government you represent.

63
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:32,877
I've an order here..

64
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:36,849
..from the Governor to feed you by
force if you do not eat on your own.

65
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,092
Open his mouth and feed him.

66
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,972
The country wiII
erupt if he dies in jaiI.

67
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,339
What am I to do, sir?

68
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,404
He refuses to Iisten to reason.

69
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,677
A dead Subhas may turn
out to be more dangerous..

70
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,081
..than Subhas who is aIive.

71
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,415
I'm afraid, I cannot guarantee
that he'II not die in jaiI.

72
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,815
Then set him free.

73
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,251
Let him go home.

74
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:17,820
Sir?

75
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:23,366
But see that he is kept surrounded
by waII of men day and night.

76
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,808
Greetings, brother.
- A teIegram from Bapu.

77
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:15,477
What is it?

78
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,749
Regret inabiIity to
interfere notwithstanding..

79
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,826
..regard and
friendship for Bose brothers.

80
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,760
Cannot Iift the ban without their..

81
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,058
..apoIogizing for indiscipIine.
M. K. Gandhi.

82
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,892
Seems Bapu is against us.

83
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,196
Not us but our ideoIogy.

84
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,164
Whatever.

85
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,333
Bapu has procIaimed that
your victory is his defeat.

86
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,772
In the Congress committee..

87
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,212
..you were isoIated even
after becoming the President?

88
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,248
I don't think Bapu wiII reIent.

89
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,350
The whoIe country is with him.

90
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,056
There's no other
mass Ieader Iike Bapu.

91
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:57,456
Using non-vioIence, he
brought the British down.

92
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,425
Bapu can understand the nation..

93
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,459
..but not the enemy.

94
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:09,801
Otherwise even after being
cheated time and again..

95
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,878
..he wouIdn't have
been ready for compromise.

96
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,005
I've made up my mind.

97
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,974
The time for compromise is over.

98
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,479
It's time for a decisive war.

99
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:29,020
As a repIy, I'II send him
the poem by WiIIiam TeII.

100
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,493
You recited it to
me in my chiIdhood.

101
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,092
''This head has never
bowed to any one.''

102
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,101
''Save the Creator.''

103
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,835
''My Iife you may stifIe..

104
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,001
..but not the voice
of my conscience.''

105
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,150
UncIe, you caIIed me?
- Yes, sit.

106
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:04,019
Turn up the radio.
- Yes.

107
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,300
Sisir, can you do something for me?

108
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,439
Sure, uncIe, teII me.

109
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:17,302
You drive weII, don't you?

110
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,068
Yes, uncIe.

111
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,469
Good.

112
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,245
Someday, you may need to
take me on a Iong drive.

113
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:26,341
But remember..

114
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,181
..you shaII teII no one about this.

115
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:36,160
''SIeep my princess..''
- A cup of tea.

116
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,227
Hot news.
- What?

117
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:43,233
Brother Subhas was
taIking to Mr. Sisir.

118
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,359
What did he say?

119
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,335
CouIdn't hear because of the radio.

120
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,463
Radio?

121
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:52,205
The radio was turned up high,
so I wasn't abIe to Iisten.

122
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:56,311
But brother toId me..

123
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,111
What?
- He wants to eat fried eggpIants.

124
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:04,479
AII your brother Subhas does
is eat throughout the day.

125
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,282
Why is the
government so scared of him?

126
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,358
Nemai, do you keep
your eyes and ears open?

127
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,296
Come here.

128
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,962
Who got down from the rickshaw?

129
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,063
IIa..

130
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,432
..post these Ietters immediateIy.
- Yes.

131
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,380
Greetings, Mr. Akbar.

132
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,519
What took you so Iong?

133
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,022
Greetings, Mr. Subhas.

134
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,257
IIa, ask Nemai to serve tea.

135
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,250
Yes, uncIe.

136
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,327
Draw the chair cIoser. I
need to confide in you.

137
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:51,560
Yes?

138
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,531
I'm aII ears, Mr.
Subhas. PIease go ahead.

139
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,169
Getting out ofjaiI was tough.

140
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,979
But the British wiII find some
excuse to imprison me again..

141
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:05,141
..and Iet me rot
there tiII the war ends.

142
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,245
Orjust kiII me.

143
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,982
So what I'd rather do..

144
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,081
..is Ieave India
for Russia via KabuI.

145
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,583
You've been there.

146
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,554
I'II heIp you.

147
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,431
But wiII Russia heIp?

148
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,559
Why not?

149
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:27,732
They oppose coIoniaIism and
therefore the British Empire.

150
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:34,745
That's why Russia can heIp us raise
a revoIutionary army to free India.

151
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,009
The time is here when we must die..

152
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,745
..to gain freedom and
break the shackIes of sIavery.

153
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,556
You've got the spirit.

154
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,327
But wiII your heaIth permit you?

155
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,564
Don't worry about my heaIth.

156
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:57,024
Just heIp me to cross the border..

157
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,070
..and reach Russia.

158
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,429
Done.

159
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,542
I've sent voIunteers for the
party conference in DeIhi.

160
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:09,478
Let me know if I can do more.
- Yes.

161
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,778
Have this. - Sure.

162
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:21,089
TeII me. Why did that
Badshah come to see Bose?

163
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:24,055
Sir, my information is
that he came to consuIt Bose..

164
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,257
..regarding the AII India
Forward BIock Conference in DeIhi.

165
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,799
And wiII Bose attend the meeting?

166
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,534
No sir, he is too weak to
traveI after his hunger strike.

167
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:34,071
But he went to the
Congress meeting on a stretcher.

168
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,197
He had to.

169
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,639
Because Gandhi's men suspected
that he was faiIing in iIIness.

170
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,536
Whatever it is.

171
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,311
See that he does not Ieave CaIcutta.

172
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,109
Do not want him out of my sight.

173
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:47,811
Left to me..

174
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,151
I'd keep him in prison
for the rest of his Iife.

175
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:55,555
Mother, that's why I've
decided to renounce the worId.

176
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:59,653
WiII you join
Aurobindo's ashram in Pondicherry?

177
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,490
PossibIy.

178
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,501
Is this the age to
renounce the worId?

179
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,665
Consider your heaIth.

180
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:08,735
Don't worry, mother.

181
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,642
IIa can serve my meaIs
whiIe I Iive in secIusion.

182
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,180
I'II communicate
with you in writing.

183
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,275
Arguing with you is useIess.

184
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,580
Sharat, make him understand.

185
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:30,127
Mother, from..

186
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,663
..tonight I'II Iive
aIone behind the curtains.

187
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,566
In this oath of siIence,
I'II meditate..

188
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,194
..sIeep on the fIoor..

189
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,169
..and eat onIy once a day.

190
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,143
After doing so for a fortnight..

191
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,679
..I'II renounce the worId.

192
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:56,878
''The aunts who put me
to sIeep, come home.''

193
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,817
Mother..

194
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:06,227
''The aunts who put me
to sIeep, come home.''

195
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:11,395
..wherever I'm..

196
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:12,629
I'II aIways reside in your heart.

197
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,565
Subhas!

198
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,302
Subhas!

199
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,372
God bIess you.

200
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:30,579
Brother.

201
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,583
God bIess you.

202
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,250
Yes, Nemai?
- I've news.

203
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,949
What? - Mr. Subhas is
going to renounce the worId.

204
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:09,289
Nonsense! Did any poIitician ever
renounce the worId? FooIish man!

205
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,223
I swear! When he was a kid..

206
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,526
..he went off to the
HimaIayas to become a monk.

207
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:19,297
He'II spend a fortnight meditating
in his chamber. - But of course.

208
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:26,741
What eIse can one who faIIs out
with Gandhi do but become a monk?

209
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:32,875
After I'm gone, the poIice
may take you for interrogation.

210
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,578
You might even be jaiIed.

211
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:39,781
You won't give in, wiII you?

212
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,561
I can't afford to have the two
of you buckIing under pressure.

213
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:46,521
Ok?

214
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,458
Let's go.

215
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:11,518
''The aunts, who put me to sIeep,
come to my pIace.''

216
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:23,331
''The aunts, who put me to sIeep,
come to my pIace.''

217
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:34,045
''The aunts, who put me to sIeep,
come to my pIace.''

218
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:41,876
''The aunts, who put me to sIeep,
come to my pIace.''

219
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,866
Hey you!
- It was off in a fIash.

220
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,903
Mr. Sisir seems to be in a hurry.

221
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:25,947
UncIe!

222
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:27,816
You can sit normaIIy now.

223
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,736
Wear this.

224
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,728
UncIe, poIice. Now what?

225
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,201
ReIax and stop.

226
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,137
Just remember..

227
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,646
..this car is yours.

228
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,982
I'm your chauffeur, Ziauddin.

229
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:39,955
Your car?

230
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,496
Yes.

231
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,092
Mine.

232
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:46,102
Why?
- What do you mean why?

233
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,766
PoIice needs to be aIert.

234
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,507
It's a CaIcutta number.

235
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:53,578
Do you have the car's papers?

236
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:04,913
Bose.

237
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,184
38/2, EIgin Road.

238
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:08,917
Sisir.

239
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,127
ReIated to the Ieader?

240
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,825
What's his name,
Subhas Chandra Bose?

241
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,797
God! What a sharp eye!

242
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,537
He is Mr. Subhas's nephew, indeed.

243
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:26,203
Have you ever met Mr. Subhas?

244
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:27,936
No.

245
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,877
Someday you'II sureIy meet him.

246
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,747
Any dangers ahead on
the road to Dhanbad?

247
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,616
With us around, how
can there be a danger?

248
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:38,680
Listen.

249
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,724
Drive carefuIIy and sIowIy.

250
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,888
WiId animaIs cross
the road at times.

251
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,857
And you're accompanying the master?

252
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,597
I'm the chauffeur.

253
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,224
Why are you making this kid drive?

254
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,228
I toId uncIe that I'd drive.

255
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:53,695
UncIe?

256
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:56,736

So the kids caII me uncIe.

00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:00,301

259
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:03,141
No, Iet them go.

260
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:04,706
Goodbye.

261
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:10,979
ReIax, Sisir.

262
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,886
We didn't spot any
wiId animaI, except him.

263
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:18,762
Sorry, I was nervous.

264
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:20,889
Can't puII of these acts.

265
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:58,760
Brother!

266
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:03,898
Sisir! You here. You

267
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,136

00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,644
Where's he?

He's taking the KaIka maiI tonight.

271
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:15,977

As an engineer, you're aware

00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:51,112
PeriIous it is, Mr. Ziauddin.

Not necessary.

A Ietter from Bose

341
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,532
Interesting!

342
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:21,014
How I wish I couId just withdraw..

00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:27,216
It seems he might
Ieave for Pondicherry soon.

345
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,189
Increase security at his house.

348
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,424
Sir.

349
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:45,638
''There may be too many troubIes.''

350
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:51,704
''But I've Iearnt never give up.''

351
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:57,053
''My conscience is here to stay..''

352
00:30:57,155 --> 00:31:02,422
..even if I die.''

353
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:10,499
''If no one heeds your caII,
be ready to waIk aIone.''

354
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:17,506
''If no one heeds your caII,
be ready to waIk aIone.''

355
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:25,508
''We wiII take
whatever comes our way now.''

356
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:33,581
I've been watching you for
the Iast three days, Mr. Shah.

357
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:36,558
You come whenever the
Frontier MaiI is expected.

358
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:37,685
Looking for someone?

359
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:41,330
I'm expecting reIatives.

360
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:02,310
Brother.

361
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:10,452
Come on. Come on.

362
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:12,491
Take me to Taj MahaI hoteI.

363
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:16,331
Give it to me, sir.
- Come here. The cart is empty.

364
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,259
Where to?

365
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:19,663
Taj MahaI.
- Okay!

366
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,500
Move!

367
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,410
Be carefuI, on the Ieft.

368
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:35,209
Be carefuI.

369
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,483
Be cIose to the Ieft.

370
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:49,325
Take straight and then Ieft.
- Stop here.

371
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:51,425
Okay.

372
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:17,785
''I'm stiII young.''

373
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:19,556
Where is Taj MahaI hoteI?
- There.

374
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,224
''I'm stiII young.''

375
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,368
''The breeze is pIeasant too.''

376
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,532
Come, sir.

377
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:19,517
The red saIute to comrade Bose.

378
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,691
You're mistaken.
My name is Ziauddin.

379
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,660
Of course.

380
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:28,561
I'm Abaad Khan.
Secretary of Kirti Kisan Party.

381
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:39,299
Abaad Khan. Secretary
of Kirti Kisan Party.

382
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:41,942
Mr. Akbar Shah couIdn't
come due to the poIice patroI.

383
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:43,877
He sent me to find out how you are.

384
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:46,711
The poIice couId've
foIIowed you too. - Don't worry.

385
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,309
I came in by the back door.

386
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,354
A reguIar habit with us communists.

387
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:53,888
You now shift to my house now.

388
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:57,953
Your home wiII be watched too,
comrade. - Don't worry.

389
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:01,029
PoIice Iooks for bigger targets.

390
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:04,729
You'II reach Moscow
by the time they know.

391
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,461
SoftIy!
- Moscow!

392
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:17,039
WeIcome.

393
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,442
A poor Pathan's house.

394
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:23,911
Upstairs.

395
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:30,661
WeIcome. WeIcome.

396
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:31,853
WeIcome.

397
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,500
So how was the journey,
Mr. Ziauddin?

398
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:42,605
So far so good. I Iook
forward to the rest.

399
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:46,370
Water.
- Give it to him in a cIean tumbIer.

400
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,001
That's not done.

401
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,376
A Pathan drinks from the KandoIi.

402
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,882
That's Iike it!

403
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:57,410
A saIwar-kameez (Long cIoth) wiII
make you Iook Iike a true Pathan.

404
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:58,946
Indeed!

405
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:03,023
What about my journey to
Soviet Russia via KabuI?

406
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:04,752
ReIax.

407
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:07,422
You've just come.
That'II be arranged, too.

408
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:08,756
Not done yet?

409
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:13,962
In a week, the news of my
escape from wiII be out.

410
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,435
It's imperative I
reach Russia before that.

411
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,870
Have you sent anyone to
Moscow from the party?

412
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:23,837
Yes.

413
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:27,451
Comrade Ramkishen and Sardar
Achar Singh Cheema were sent.

414
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:31,388
It so happened..
- As soon as I reached, I heard..

415
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:34,515
..comrade Ramkishen
drowned whiIe crossing the river.

416
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:37,389
And Sardar Achar Singh Cheema..

417
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:40,726
..was arrested by the
Russian border poIice.

418
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,130
You mean, no contact
estabIished with Russians yet?

419
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:45,929
That'II be done, Mr. Subhas.

420
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,400
Comrade Bhagatram TaIwar
of Kirti Kisan Party..

421
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:52,567
..has a good rapport
with the Russians.

422
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,445
He'II escort you to
KabuI and Moscow. - No!

423
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:59,409
I've toId everyone
in the viIIage that..

424
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,781
..I'm escorting
comrade Bose to Moscow.

425
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:03,477
What?

426
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:04,885
You've toId everyone?

427
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,025
Who eIse knows that
Subhas Bose is here?

428
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,087
This isn't how
underground operations are done.

429
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:22,029
Forgive me.

430
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:25,566
I beg your pardon.

431
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,676
But your cIothes are ready.

432
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,778
A Ieader of his stature,
siIent for so Iong?

433
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:35,115
Is Mr. Subhas dumbstruck?

434
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:38,047
No, he is has
taken a vow of siIence.

435
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:41,089
Even Mr. Gandhi keeps
siIence on Tuesdays.

436
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:42,982
Subhas Chandra Bose is not Gandhi.

437
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:44,960
No one can suppress his voice.

438
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:48,631
At Ieast, Iet him
say why is he siIent.

439
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:51,028
Why don't you give
it to me in writing?

440
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:53,730
If he isn't meditating,
he'II repIy without deIay.

441
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:58,866
Now you Iook Iike a reaI Pathan.

442
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:00,944
But KabaIis are never so cIean.

443
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,512
Don't worry!

444
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:05,213
Just Iive in these
cIothes for a few days.

445
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,710
You'II Iook Iike a true Pathan.

446
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,217
That must be
comrade Bhagatram TaIwar.

447
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:14,882
Abaad Khan?

448
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:16,789
Come up.
- Yes.

449
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,156
He'II heIp you cross into Russia.

450
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,129
Red saIute.
- SaIute.

451
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:25,626
Come!

452
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:29,897
Mr. Subhas, this is
comrade Bhagatram TaIwar.

453
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,235
His famiIy has sacrificed a Iot.

454
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,510
His brother Harkishen was hanged.

455
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:38,946
I've heard a Iot about Harkishen's
martyrdom, Mr. Bhagatram.

456
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:43,018
So I thought, Bhagatram
wouId be a taII Pathan.

457
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:46,954
Do not measure his
stature by his height.

458
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:50,855
He is very smart.

459
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,764
Anyway, he is your
nephew Rehmat Khan.

460
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,599
And this is your uncIe.

461
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,562
Khan Mohammed Ziauddin Khan.

462
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:59,931
Greet your uncIe.

463
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:03,973
WeIcome, may god protect
you and keep you happy.

464
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,667
In repIy, you say.

465
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:09,212
May God protect you too.

466
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:13,272
May God protect..
- No.

467
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:15,608
Open your mouth and
the secret wiII be out.

468
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,178
Even I can't teach
you Pashtu in 2 days.

469
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,215
What if he doesn't speak at aII?

470
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:22,984
How ridicuIous!

471
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:25,595
Humans are bound to speak, comrade!

472
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,630
Humans can be dumb too.

473
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:29,131
Great idea!

474
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,859
I'II say, he Iost his
voice due to iIIness.

475
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,995
And I'm taking him to the shrine
in Adda Sharif across the border.

476
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,145
Mr. Subhas, we'II stop here.

477
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:43,871
There must be poIice outside.

478
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:45,005
Fine.

479
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,748
Comrade Abaad Khan, thanks.

480
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:56,654
May you attain your goaI
and freedom for India.

481
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,252
FareweII.

482
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:00,658
Red saIute.
- Red saIute.

483
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:08,897
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

484
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:18,615
''LoneIy traveIIer on
his path goes on.''

485
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:25,782
''LoneIy traveIIer on
his path goes on.''

486
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:33,687
''Come what may, he must head on.''

487
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:40,301
''If no one heeds
your caII, waIk aIone.''

488
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:47,871
''If no one heeds
your caII, waIk aIone.''

489
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:53,707
''WaIk aIone.''

490
00:40:53,818 --> 00:41:00,246
''If no one heeds
your caII, waIk aIone.''

491
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:16,672
''I have staked my ..

492
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:22,804
.. Iife on this wager.''

493
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:29,679
''I have staked my ..

494
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:34,884
.. Iife on this wager.''

495
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:44,333
''Life or death, come what may.''

496
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:54,876
''Life or death, come what may.''

497
00:41:55,346 --> 00:42:01,842
''If no one heeds
your caII, waIk aIone.''

498
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:08,417
''If no one heeds
your caII, waIk aIone.''

499
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:09,983
HaIt.

500
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:12,920
Name?
- Rehmat Khan.

501
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,395
Rehmat Khan. Where from?

502
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:15,965
Nowshera.
- Nowshera.

503
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,927
And what's your name?
- Ziauddin Khan.

504
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,766
Shut up, he'II say that.
Is he dumb?

505
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:24,068
He is dumb.

506
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,268
He's dumb, indeed. - Yes.

507
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,902
Was be born dumb?

508
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,173
No, officer.

509
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:35,115
Last year, he Iost his
voice due to an iIIness.

510
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:37,413
I'm taking him to
Adda Sharif for a cure.

511
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:42,481
I know how to make bigmouths
dumb and make the dumb speak.

512
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:46,258
Show me your tongue.
- Stick out your tongue, uncIe.

513
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,264
CarefuI.

514
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,259
Stiff!

515
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:54,502
CompIicated case.

516
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:56,404
Take him on the piIgrimage.

517
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:59,340
The saint's bIessing might
give him his speech back.

518
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:03,344
Right.
- GargIing with aIum aIso heIps.

519
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:10,343
Go.
- Thanks, officer. - Go.

520
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:19,152
IIa.
- Yes?

521
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:21,326
Give this sweet to your UncIe.

522
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:26,802
If he doesn't care to greet
his mother even on his birthday..

523
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:29,236
..then I don't care for him either.

524
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:42,011
Happy birthday, uncIe!

525
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:52,858
May we rest a whiIe, Mr. Subhas.

526
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:58,992
TaIwar.
- Yes.

527
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,469
What a beautifuI Iand!

528
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:05,905
Bare mountains Iook beautifuI?

529
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,234
Freedom!

530
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,970
It's a free country.
That's why it's beautifuI.

531
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:13,849
You got a rupee coin?
- Sure.

532
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,947
But what can you buy here?

533
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:20,147
I want to stomp on the
face of the British Emperor.

534
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:26,418
And I want to spit on the
face of his puppet, the viceroy.

535
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:28,956
I'II stomp too.

536
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:30,924
Take this!

537
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:34,160
And this!

538
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:45,905
Sister IIa. He hasn't
even touched the food.

539
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:49,519
Sister IIa. - What happened,
Nemai? - I hope he's aII right.

540
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:03,900
UncIe isn't here!

541
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:06,329
Don't know where he has gone.

542
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:09,098
Is somebody there? Brother Sisir.

543
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:11,934
Mother, uncIe is nowhere to be seen.

544
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:14,270
Nemai, did you see him going out?

545
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:16,208
What? He isn't in his room?

546
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:21,573
Has he Ieft us?
- I don't understand.

547
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:24,978
Sisir.

548
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,983
I knew he'd do this.

549
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:31,923
Take Subhas's horoscope and go..

550
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:36,363
..to the priest at KaIighat.
He may be abIe to teII us.

551
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:44,668
You didn't see him Ieave either?

552
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,543
What are you being paid for?

553
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,678
To keep a watch.

554
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:54,377
A 6 feet taII man
couIdn't have just vanished.

555
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:56,309
Vanished?

556
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:57,984
This is ridicuIous!

557
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:01,387
Chasing sages aII over the country.
PuIIing off their beards.

558
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,684
And what have we to show for it?

559
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:04,961
Sir, here's a report that
he has gone to Bangkok..

560
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:06,495
..to become a Buddhist monk.

561
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:08,961
Rubbish! Next to be
teIIing me he has gone..

562
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:10,693
..to Afghanistan to
join the Fakir of Ippi.

563
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:13,970
''Let us aII gather and praise Lord.''

564
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:17,507
''He's caIIing you.''

565
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:29,584
''The greatest deed, the
prophet says, is to praise Lord.''

theirs who praise Lord.''

567
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:53,403
''AII desire is kiIIed
by the sword of Lord.''

568
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:04,747
''Peace, heaIth and cure is
with those who praise the Lord.''

569
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:28,341
''In my heart there is onIy Lord.''

570
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:34,242

00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:39,789
''The righteous path of God.''

572
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:42,652
''Lord is great!''

573
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:48,720
''Each fIower, fragrance,
aII beings. GIow of God.''

574
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:54,737
''Each fIower, fragrance,
aII beings. GIow of God.''

575
00:47:54,838 --> 00:48:00,674
''FiII your heart with
the praise of Lord.''

576
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:03,644
''OnIy taIk about God.''

577
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,681
''We beg for forgiveness.''

578
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,512
''The great prophet Mohammed.''

579
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,646
''The righteous path of God.

''It is better to take his name
than hate and wrongfuI deed.''

581
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:27,693
''It is better to take his name
than argue and maIign others.''

582
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:30,602
''OnIy taIk about God.''

583
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,608

00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:12,737
Who defeated the Greeks? We.

604

Who stopped the Shakas? We.

605
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:17,714
Who vanquished the Huns? We.

606
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,282
Who drove away the
Iranians and the Turanians? We.

607
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:22,215
Now it's the turn of the British.

608
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:24,517
Friends and freedom fighters!

609
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:31,491
I stand here on this hoIy Iand not
as a saint but as a freedom fighter.

610
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,225
By drawing the Durand Line across
the hoIy Iand of Afghanistan..

611
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:38,495
..these
non-beIievers have divided us.

612
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:41,571
We, Pashtuns wiII never
accede to this partition.

613
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:43,566
And we're not aIone.

614
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:47,275
ItaIy and Germany
support our hoIy war.

615
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:49,242
God sent us to this
worId to destroy them..

616
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:52,281
..Raise your voices
to crush the British.

617
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:58,248
God is Supreme.
- Yes, he is.

618
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:00,982
This mendicant is an expert,
Mr. Subhas.

619
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:06,558
They say, he makes
impossibIe things happen.

620
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:11,260
If onIy he was a mass Ieader instead
of an eccentric freedom fighter..

621
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:13,359
..he couId've served our cause.

622
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:16,005
He's nicknamed as the
mad foIIower of God.

623
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:18,406
Don't worry, mother.

624
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:21,271
The poIice are Iooking
for him in Pondicherry.

625
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:23,473
Why wouId the poIice search for him?

626
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:26,312
It's they who abducted him.

627
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:30,285
God knows how he is.

628
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:31,820
It's not so, mother.

629
00:51:32,456 --> 00:51:34,788
The whoIe county is
anxious about your son.

630
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:37,886
Rabindranath
Tagore has sent a cabIe.

631
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:41,724
DeepIy concerned over
Shubhash's disappearance.

632
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:43,856
Convey to mother my sympathy.

633
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:46,495
KindIy keep me informed.
Rabindranath.

634
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:50,603
Sharad Babu, there's a
teIegram from Mr. Gandhi. - Yes.

635
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:56,436
Here.

636
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:04,318
The Mahatma wishes to know
why Subhas has disappeared.

637
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:06,813
Sisir.

638
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,752
What did the priest of KaIighat say?

639
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:15,489
He said uncIe was
destined to renounce the worId.

640
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:17,360
He invoked the spirits.

641
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:21,501
The Goddess toId him that
uncIe has renounced everything.

642
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:26,436
Can't find his shoes either.

643
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,339
If he has renounced the worId..

644
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:30,777
..why wouId he take his shoes?
- Which one?

645
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:32,072
His waIking shoes?

646
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,508
Sisir took them for repairs.

647
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:37,076
Yes,

648
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,348
I gave them to the
Chinese shoemaker.

649
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:40,818
What's your probIem? Go away.

650
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:44,383
What do we repIy to Mr. Gandhi?

651
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:49,624
Write that Subhas has
probabIy renounced the worId.

652
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,398
They say that It'II
be totaIIy crushed.

653
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:27,402
Former president of AII India
Congress and Forward BIock Ieader..

654
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,404
..Bose is reported to be
missing from his..

655
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:31,940
..CaIcutta
residence since Iast night.

656
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:37,940
PoIice say he may be hiding
in a monastery in South India.

657
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:40,711
Escaped! He's escaped.

658
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:42,613
He fooIed them.

659
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:47,587
MussadiIaI. - Yes sir. -
Distribute sweets to everyone.

660
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:52,056
The BengaI Tiger Subhas
has escaped again. - ReaIIy?

661
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:57,058
Here's a kiIo of sweets. Free!

662
00:53:57,968 --> 00:53:58,992
Why free?

663
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:01,527
Somebody caIIed Subhas
has escaped from the British.

664
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,708
UncIe, these Afghans are generous.

665
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:07,470
Their kiIo weighs four times ours.

666
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:12,171
Pack haIf of it for us to take home.
We'II give a bIessing to Subhas.

667
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:13,506
Sure.

668
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:16,881
Indians? Where from?
- Nowshera.

669
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:20,479
Nowshera, near Peshawar.

670
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:22,615
I know that pIace.

671
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,021
I know everything.

672
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:28,729
Who's this Subhas?

673
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:34,468
Who inspired such
generosity in this miser?

674
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:38,132
I don't know. There's no
one in Nowshera by that name.

675
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:39,572
Eat the sweet, Khan.

676
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:40,767
I see.

677
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:43,645
I'II eat.
- Let's move, uncIe.

678
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:27,955
Excuse me, I'm Rehmat Khan.

679
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:31,956
I've never seen you.

680
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,723
My friend Zaman, works here.
- Who is Zaman?

681
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:37,159
Zaman aIias MikhaiI Andreyevich.

682
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,825
I aIso know the Russian Ambassador.

683
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:41,561
You know him?
- Yes.

684
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:43,831
And I know the king of KabuI!

685
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,531
You can't enter without a pass.

686
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:47,767
Get out.

687
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:49,639
Get out.

688
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:53,548
You said everyone here knows you!

689
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:56,550
Remember you're dumb!
Let's try them.

690
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:05,290
Madam, a IittIe heIp.

691
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:09,860
PIease carry this

Greetings!
- Greetings!

704
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:13,652
We must contact the Russians anyhow.

705
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:17,359
I've not come to rest here.

706
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:20,833
If you can't, I'II do it on my own.

707
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:24,701
The Russian system
works differentIy.

708
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:29,708
Trust me. Just Iet me find Zaman.
Everything wiII be fine.

709
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:36,012
Son of a pig! What are you
up to? Who are you? TeII me.

710
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:38,946
Why have you come here?
What have we done?

711
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:41,249
I know you're up to something.

712
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:50,222
I'm supposed to report aII
suspicious characters in KabuI.

713
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:52,164
Why have you come to KabuI?

714
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:57,264
My uncIe took iII and
Iost his speech. - I see!

715
00:57:57,407 --> 00:58:00,035
My mother has sent
us here for a cure.

716
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:01,200
ReaIIy!
- Yes.

717
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,973
FooI.

718
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:08,243
Why were you at the Russian
embassy? I know everything.

719
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:11,346
They say, there are
exceIIent doctors in Russia.

720
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,354
UncIe, reIax. Listen.

721
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:16,118
Idiot.

722
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:19,986
It costs money to touch me, fooI!

723
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:23,121
Khan, you want bribe?
Let's go there.

724
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:30,200
Here.
- What's this? Okay.

725
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:34,743
Listen carefuIIy, no
troubIe from now on.

726
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:36,375
I know everything.

727
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:38,271
Go!

728
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:43,843
Why did you pay him?

729
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:46,453
It'II confirm his doubts.

730
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:51,759
We'II have to Ieave
before he gets the poIice.

731
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:55,023
He'II do nothing.
He's just corrupt.

732
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:59,397
I've a great Indian Ieader with me.

733
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:02,266
I know. Subhas Chandra Bose.

734
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:04,463
You know?
- Yes.

735
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:07,300
I must take him to Soviet Union.

736
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:11,411
Comrade Ram, why
are you heIping him?

737
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:15,211
He said that India can
never become communists.

738
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:18,286
But I've been sent by the party.

739
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:22,254
I see. The party is
stiII new in India.

740
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:26,760
Your friend Achar Singh Cheema
asked Comrade StaIin..

741
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:29,093
..to heIp Chandra Bose.

742
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:33,028
But senior Indian comrades
based in Europe say that

743
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:36,332
Chandra Bose is no
good for revoIution.

744
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:38,097
It's my request.

745
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:42,504
Zaman, I promised
that you'II heIp him.

746
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:45,437
TeII him that you
couIdn't find Zaman.

747
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:50,510
CouIdn't find Zaman,
don't worry Mr. Subhas.

748
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:53,422
Getting you to Moscow
is my responsibiIity.

749
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:57,458
Son of a swine. You're stiII here!

750
00:59:58,194 --> 01:00:02,893
Can't find a
hospitaI for your uncIe?

751
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:08,863
I know what cure you're
Iooking for.

752
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:13,101
I toId you!
- Shut up. Pig!

753
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:17,106
By god.

754
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:20,238
Your uncIe's goId
watch is very nice.

755
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:21,840
Don't touch the watch.

756
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:23,543
I'm his nephew, taIk to me.

757
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:26,083
You keep your uncIe's watch.

758
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:32,161
I'II take you to the poIice
station and teach you a Iesson.

759
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:33,285
Come on.

760
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:37,025
Hands off my uncIe! He gets fits.
- Come on.

761
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:40,996
What do you want now? You've
aIready taken money from me.

762
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:43,029
This.

763
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,971
GoId watch is mine.

764
01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:54,373
You scoundreI. You try
to confront this Khan?

765
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:00,446
WeII done, Subhas.

766
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:04,986
This watch is your reward for
passing the ICS examination.

767
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:12,258
Thank you, father.

768
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:15,332
But I don't wish to
take up a governmentjob.

769
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:21,909
Why? - Because one can't serve
the British and India together.

770
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:25,441
My father's gift
for passing the ICS.

771
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:27,542
I opted out of civiI service.

772
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:30,613
Now I've Iost the watch.

773
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:36,254
We ought to Ieave
this pIace, TaIwar.

774
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:40,257
This is the German embassy.
Russian embassy is just opposite.

775
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:43,193
Germany might heIp.
- One minute.

776
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:46,925
Look! Ambassador
KozIov with his wife.

777
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,061
Stay here whiIe I taIk to him.

778
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:52,468
Comrade KozIov. Comrade KozIov.

779
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:54,200
Listen. PIease!

780
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:59,139
I've some one with me who is
seeking asyIum in the Soviet Union.

781
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:01,512
There he is. Subhas Chandra Bose.

782
01:02:01,684 --> 01:02:05,279
The Indian revoIutionary.
Former president of the congress.

783
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:09,289
How do I know this man
with you is Subhas Bose?

784
01:02:09,425 --> 01:02:11,325
He Iooks Iike an Afghan to me.

785
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:15,227
No Comrade, beIieve me. He
is Subhas Chandra Bose.

786
01:02:15,698 --> 01:02:17,222
My party has sent me.

787
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:21,266
Even if he is who you say
he is, I can't heIp you.

788
01:02:21,971 --> 01:02:25,372
Comrade, pIease! PIease.

789
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:35,540
He couIdn't understand me.

790
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:38,082
You didn't teII him I'm here?

791
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:41,987
I toId him, he asked for proof!

792
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:45,253
Don't worry, Iet me find Zaman.

793
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:47,056
FooI thinks you're an Afghan.

794
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:51,690
Forget it. Divert the guard's
attention. I'II waIk right in.

795
01:03:03,646 --> 01:03:05,546
Brother, excuse me.

796
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:11,208
Been Iooking for hours.
Where is this pIace?

797
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:12,715
Straight, then right.

798
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:14,723
I'm Subhas Chandra Bose.

799
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:23,360
What a coincidence. I was
just reading about your escape.

800
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:27,730
BiIger. Hanks BiIger. PIease.

801
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:30,164
I need your heIp, Herr.

802
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:32,734
I wish to seek
asyIum in your embassy.

803
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:35,742
It was very rash of you
to come here Iike this.

804
01:03:36,078 --> 01:03:38,171
KabuI is coaIing
with British agents.

805
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:40,440
AII the more reason you
shouId give me sheIter here.

806
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:42,278
We cannot have you here.

807
01:03:43,786 --> 01:03:46,186
There are many Afghans
working in this pIace.

808
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:50,052
Some of them couId be spies.
PIease understand, Herr. Bose.

809
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:53,323
AsyIum cannot be given
at a moment's notice.

810
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:57,228
There are procedures.
I must consuIt BerIin.

811
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,667
I must inform my coIIeague,
the ItaIian ambassador.

812
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:04,034
Herr BiIger, the Iodge I'm
staying in has aIready been..

813
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:05,767
..visited by the poIice.

814
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:09,468
I need to get out of KabuI.
Can you heIp me do that?

815
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:14,072
There is onIy one way,
through Russia.

816
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:18,476
For that you need a
transit visa. It is not so easy.

817
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:20,480
Then what do you suggest?

818
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:29,058
I can promise you this.

819
01:04:29,165 --> 01:04:31,725
I'II contact my foreign
office immediateIy.

820
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:33,631
And I'II Iet you know
as soon as possibIe.

821
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:36,067
In the mean time I suggest you
to stay at the..

822
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:38,072
..Indian quarters in Shor Bazar.

823
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:04,530
You're Uttam Chand MaIhotra?

824
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:08,101
Today it was Iearnt that..
- Yes. TeII me.

825
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:09,328
Red saIute!

826
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:13,102
You've heard of the comrade
who was hung for kiIIing..

827
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:14,699
..the Punjab Governor?

828
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:19,108
Harkishen TaIwar?

829
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:20,512
Yes, I'm his brother.

830
01:05:20,616 --> 01:05:23,676
I'm here on a poIiticaI mission.
I need your heIp.

831
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:26,218
I can't heIp you.

832
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:30,557
I migrated to KabuI for business,
not poIitics.

833
01:05:31,894 --> 01:05:33,555
Antenna for PhiIips radio?

834
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:37,860
Come next week.

835
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:39,692
Thank you.

836
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:43,171
You Iie!

837
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:45,172
Or you wouIdn't have
sent a customer away.

838
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:47,502
You want a donation?

839
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:48,667
No!

840
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:51,876
I haven't come with
such a trifIe request.

841
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:56,641
A great Ieader of India has
fooIed the British and escaped.

842
01:05:56,852 --> 01:05:59,787
I'm asking sheIter for
that poIiticaI fugitive.

843
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:01,446
Who is it?

844
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:06,460
You sound as if it's
Subhas Chandra Bose.

845
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:07,619
Indeed!

846
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:11,390
Yes!

847
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:16,462
Red saIute!

848
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:28,615
Mr. Subhas.

849
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:36,549
WeIcome.

850
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:51,397
Sit.

851
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:01,681
Take off your socks.

852
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:03,647
They're wet.

853
01:07:03,986 --> 01:07:06,318
For the first time since I
Ieft India, I feeI at home.

854
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:08,654
You're being poIite.

855
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:11,653
It's just a poor man's hoveI.

856
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:12,919
Listen.

857
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:20,827
WiII they stay here?

858
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:23,872
Where eIse?

859
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,671
They've come from India.

860
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:30,777
They're reIatives.

861
01:07:30,913 --> 01:07:33,279
ReIatives? Never seen them before.

862
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:35,850
How are they reIated?

863
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:37,615
Distant reIations.

864
01:07:37,753 --> 01:07:39,687
Not a question of
being cIose or distant.

865
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:42,917
Since when have MusIims
become your reIatives?

866
01:07:43,025 --> 01:07:46,290
Keep your voice down.

867
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:49,625
They might hear.

868
01:07:52,368 --> 01:07:54,893
WiII you cook something for them?

869
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:59,466
OnIy as Iong as it's just one meaI.

870
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:03,003
But don't you taIk of
Ietting them stay here!

871
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:09,443
Thank you, Mr. Uttam Chand.

872
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:10,776
MarveIIous!

873
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:12,954
Nothing Iike home-cooked food.

874
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:16,788
My wife has a sharp tongue,
but she's a wonderfuI cook.

875
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:21,819
Now you Iook more Iike
Subhas Chandra Bose, the Ieader.

876
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:26,466
It's time for you to rest.

877
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:30,300
They say you've
renounced the worId..

878
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:35,343
..but I haven't. I
must return to my wife.

879
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:37,636
Goodnight.

880
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:42,444
I'm downstairs. If you
need anything caII me.

881
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:49,553
You haven't sIept yet?

882
01:08:51,093 --> 01:08:53,357
Why are you bothered?

883
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:57,821
Why have you hidden
them in the attic?

884
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:01,068
Who are they? You won't say?

885
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:03,062
I toId you.

886
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:06,373
I know. I'm not bIind of deaf.

887
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:08,074
I can see and hear.

888
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:11,506
Been spying?
- Why not?

889
01:09:11,714 --> 01:09:14,581
You're out ofjaiI
because of my father!

890
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:17,015
To heII with your father!

891
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:22,022
You're messing with criminaIs
again! - Someone might hear. - So?

892
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:26,090
The poIice wiII hauI
them away. Good riddance!

893
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:28,086
Do you even know who he is?

894
01:09:29,398 --> 01:09:30,422
Subhas.

895
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:32,925
Subhas Chandra Bose.

896
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:39,766
Subhas Chandra Bose?

897
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:46,006
I thought you were a criminaI.

898
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:49,549
It must be my good deeds that

899
01:09:50,419 --> 01:09:52,649
I can serve a great man Iike you.

900
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:56,686
This house is a bit smaII but..
- Not at aII.

901
01:09:57,526 --> 01:09:59,426
It's good to Iive with a famiIy.

902
01:10:00,763 --> 01:10:04,597
You never thought of
marriage and a famiIy?

903
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:12,965
Mr. Subhas.

904
01:10:15,844 --> 01:10:18,005
You sent Bhagatram on an errand?

905
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,710
Sent him to meet the
Germans at Siemens.

906
01:10:22,117 --> 01:10:23,914
But I'm not sure if
he can do anything.

907
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:28,418
I wonder if I've made
a mistake by..

908
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:32,153
..reIying on Kirti
Kisan party and Bhagatram.

909
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:37,564
Bhagatram taIks a Iot but no work.

910
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:39,892
I think he has his compuIsions.

911
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:43,801
I'd rather make it
to Russia on my own.

912
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,165
Getting to the border is easy.

913
01:10:47,676 --> 01:10:50,668
But beyond that, you
need an experienced guide.

914
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:52,041
It's dangerous.

915
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:53,978
Is this town any Iess dangerous,
Mr. Uttam Chand?

916
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:57,914
What did Thomas say?
Any news from BerIin?

917
01:10:58,053 --> 01:10:59,077
I don't know.

918
01:10:59,622 --> 01:11:02,090
But he asked us to meet the
ItaIian Ambassador tomorrow.

919
01:11:02,224 --> 01:11:04,715
First Russian, then German,
now ItaIian?

920
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:07,987
CongratuIations, Mr. Bose on
your successfuI escape to KabuI.

921
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:09,121
Thank you.

922
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:11,631
But exiIe in KabuI is not
the purpose of my mission.

923
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:13,928
It is just the first step
towards Iiberating India.

924
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:16,094
We need your heIp and co-operation.

925
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:17,833
How can we heIp you?

926
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:19,471
I wouId Iike you to persuade Rome..

927
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:22,635
..to recognize our
government of free India in exiIe.

928
01:11:23,512 --> 01:11:24,536
Once Rome agrees..

929
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,477
BerIin and Moscow wiII foIIow.

930
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,481
When our government is recognized..

931
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:31,678
..I propose to raise an army of
Iiberation to march into India..

932
01:11:32,254 --> 01:11:33,516
..through the Soviet Union.

933
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:36,489
Mr. Bose, much as we
wouId Iike to heIp you..

934
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:38,492
..I know that in the
Rome-BerIin axis..

935
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:40,221
..BerIin is the dominant partner.

936
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:43,490
The first step towards
recognition of your government..

937
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:45,533
..has to be taken by BerIin..

938
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:46,930
..and onIy by BerIin.

939
01:11:47,069 --> 01:11:49,867
Then get me to BerIin.
- I'II try my best to do that.

940
01:11:50,539 --> 01:11:53,531
But as I said before, BerIin
wiII have to give the go-ahead.

941
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:55,075
But I've aIready met the Germans..

942
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:57,102
..and they asked me to
be in touch with you.

943
01:11:57,579 --> 01:11:59,945
And now you teII me that
everything depends on the Germans.

944
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:01,106
Mr. Bose..

945
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:03,245
I personaIIy beIieve in your cause..

946
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:06,521
..and I'II do everything I
can to get you to BerIin.

947
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:08,647
Thank you Husanio Quaroni.

948
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:11,154
In the mean time,
how can we contact you?

949
01:12:11,293 --> 01:12:13,523
Through Mr. Uttam Chand
MaIhotra of the Shor Bazar.

950
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:18,256
Mr. Subhas.

951
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:21,262
What's the news, Mr. Uttam Chand?
- Good news.

952
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:24,730
I've found a good guide to
take you to Russia. - What?

953
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:25,964
Guide?

954
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:27,801
This is not right.

955
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:32,010
When Quaroni said he'II heIp,
we ought to wait.

956
01:12:32,214 --> 01:12:34,614
It's been 52 days. Am
I to wait for 52 weeks?

957
01:12:35,651 --> 01:12:37,084
The Russians stood me up.

958
01:12:37,953 --> 01:12:39,784
The Germans sent me
to the ItaIians.

959
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:42,283
ItaIians say that they
must ask the Russians.

960
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:45,555
Instead of going nowhere,
Iet's go to Mazhar Sharif..

961
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:48,129
..and cross the Oxus
river into Soviet Union.

962
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:50,993
But the Oxus river is treacherous!

963
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:53,634
We couId drown Iike Ramkishen..

964
01:12:53,736 --> 01:12:54,998
If you're scared of drowning,
don't come.

965
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:03,009
Come what may,
I'm ready to face it.

966
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:12,083
You useIess chap.

967
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:14,889
You've aIready
gobbIed up three heIpings.

968
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:16,081
Who'II pay?

969
01:13:18,761 --> 01:13:20,023
Don't worry.

970
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:23,062
You'II get the money.
My friends are coming.

971
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:25,323
Who'II pay for you?

972
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:26,658
Two guys.

973
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:28,733
I'm escorting them to Russia.

974
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:31,235
Not an easy job!
- Escorting!? Whom?

975
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:33,766
Two Pathans from your Iand.

976
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:40,776
There, they are here. See there.

977
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:43,112
Officer, nab him.

978
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:46,186
Stop! You fooI!

979
01:13:46,722 --> 01:13:53,093
Stop! Where are you running?

980
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:56,890
Taking uncIe and nephew to Russia!?

981
01:13:58,066 --> 01:13:59,693
I know.

982
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:01,666
I knew they were up to something.

983
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:06,070
How are you reIated?
- Mercy sir.

984
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:09,075
What a stupid pIan, comrade!

985
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:11,803
ApoIiticaI! You've spoiIt it aII.

986
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:14,308
That fooI wiII squeaI.

987
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:16,646
OnIy if he knew.

988
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:19,310
I didn't teII him about you.

989
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:23,016
When the poIice torture him..
- He's an oId jaiIbird.

990
01:14:23,425 --> 01:14:25,689
Been in jaiI twice for murder.

991
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:28,856
What do you know of
hardcore criminaIs?

992
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:34,031
He'II get beaten
but he won't squeaI.

993
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:38,037
But that poIiceman knows who we are.

994
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:40,900
Soon the neighbours wiII suspect us.

995
01:14:41,944 --> 01:14:45,846
Before the British poIice arrive,
we ought to Ieave.

996
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:48,814
Mr. Subhas, where to?

997
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:50,712
We've nowhere to go.

998
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:53,688
May I see Mr. MaIhotra, pIease?

999
01:14:53,856 --> 01:14:55,949
Here's a foreigner Iady to meet you.

1000
01:15:01,396 --> 01:15:02,420
I'II be back.

1001
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:13,772
Sorry, madam, you
had to wait for me.

1002
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:15,100
What can I do for you?

1003
01:15:15,878 --> 01:15:19,336
I'm Sierra Quaroni, wife
of the ItaIian ambassador.

1004
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:20,709
TeII me the message.

1005
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:23,915
These are the formaI papers.

1006
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:27,146
The Axis powers wiII be
happy to weIcome Mr. Bose.

1007
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:30,452
Ask him to foIIow the
instructions in the attached note.

1008
01:15:30,759 --> 01:15:32,454
This doesn't feeI right,
Mr. Subhas.

1009
01:15:33,295 --> 01:15:34,922
You shouId have gone to Russia.

1010
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:39,730
That's what I wanted. But
who knows what Russia wants?

1011
01:15:40,903 --> 01:15:44,737
I hope ItaIy and
Germany don't use you Iike..

1012
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:48,003
..they're using
that crazy Ippi Fakir.

1013
01:15:48,844 --> 01:15:51,870
A man who gives British sIeepIess
nights for years can't be crazy.

1014
01:15:52,514 --> 01:15:54,311
If not Russia, Iet it be Germany.

1015
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:56,482
For India's freedom..

1016
01:15:57,519 --> 01:16:00,181
..I'II take the deviI's side.
- Give it to me.

1017
01:16:00,522 --> 01:16:01,750
No, Iet's go.

1018
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:14,092
Mr. Uttam Chand.

1019
01:16:14,202 --> 01:16:16,261
I'm deepIy indebted to you.

1020
01:16:16,972 --> 01:16:18,337
I don't know how I'II repay.

1021
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,364
Don't say that.

1022
01:16:21,176 --> 01:16:23,906
You graced us by staying here.

1023
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:32,049
I feIt we've contributed
to the war of independence..

1024
01:16:33,956 --> 01:16:37,221
Subhas, don't say no.

1025
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:41,157
Three goId guineas
that my mother gave.

1026
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:43,158
This is from me.

1027
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:46,097
My bit for India's freedom.

1028
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:51,231
BIessings of the
motherIand for you.

1029
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:06,478
FareweII.

1030
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:22,130
Here's your new Passport.

1031
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:27,002
OrIando Matsota.

1032
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:28,933
But that's not my name.

1033
01:17:29,344 --> 01:17:32,142
The Russians are reIuctant to
give you even a transit visa.

1034
01:17:32,414 --> 01:17:33,847
So you'II have to
traveI as Matsota..

1035
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:36,008
..through Russia to Germany.

1036
01:17:36,351 --> 01:17:39,343
From now on you'II be
Count OrIando Matsota.

1038
01:17:43,025 --> 01:17:45,220
First Mohammad Ziauddin,

1039
01:17:45,927 --> 01:17:48,418
Then Ziauddin Khan,
a mute tribaI Pathan.

1040
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:50,892
And now an ItaIian Count.

1041
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:54,295
AII this for the motherIand.

1042

Thank you, Senora.

1047
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:15,280

01:18:24,232 --> 01:18:27,133
Send this message to my friends
in the Forward BIock in CaIcutta.

1052
01:18:27,936 --> 01:18:28,960
Yes.

1053
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:30,332
Tears in a Pathan's eyes?

1054
01:18:30,672 --> 01:18:34,631
We'II meet again for sure,
comrade. In free India!

1055
01:18:38,413 --> 01:18:40,540
Bye.
- Red saIute.

1056
01:18:40,682 --> 01:18:45,642
''When wiII we

1057
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:50,357
''WiII this difficuIt

1058
01:18:50,692 --> 01:18:55,356
''Today we'II get the
answers to aII our questions.''

1059
01:18:55,564 --> 01:19:07,066
''Today is the day of decision.''

1060
01:19:07,342 --> 01:19:14,180
''The IoneIy traveIIer wiII
move ahead on his path.''

1061
01:19:25,327 --> 01:19:27,386
Why shouId I meet
this ItaIian, Swami?

1062
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:28,520
Won't heIp matters.

1063
01:19:28,663 --> 01:19:32,394
His ExceIIency OrIando
Matsota is a fine man.

1064
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:35,135
Why are you patronizing him?

1065
01:19:36,004 --> 01:19:37,403
What's so great about him?

1066
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:41,474
Once you meet him, you'II know.
- Brother, are you an Indian?

1067
01:19:42,144 --> 01:19:44,305
Yes Sardar, heIIo!

1068
01:19:44,412 --> 01:19:46,073
Greetings!

1069
01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:49,241
Good god, what a reIief to
hear one's mother tongue.

1070
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:52,280
Otherwise who Iistens to prisoners
of war in this foreign Iand?

1071
01:19:52,387 --> 01:19:53,411
You are POW's?

1072
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:55,580
Yes Sir. Got arrested in Africa.

1073
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:58,718
Poor Gurbachan Iost
his identity papers.

1074
01:19:59,161 --> 01:20:02,722
And now the British and the
Germans are tossing us about.

1075
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:06,296
Look at this, sir. They've given
this bunch of forms to fiII up.

1076
01:20:06,568 --> 01:20:08,502
We can't understand their Ianguage.

1077
01:20:09,504 --> 01:20:11,369
Don't worry, we'II
fiII them for you.

1078
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,665
Thank you, sir.
- Abid, you can fiII that Iater.

1079
01:20:13,775 --> 01:20:15,504
His ExceIIency is very
particuIar about time. Abid come.

1080
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:17,305
Wait! Name?

1081
01:20:17,779 --> 01:20:21,647
Gurbachan Singh Mangad.

Yes. Coming.

1085

OrIando Matsota.
- Abid, come on.

1086
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:46,764
HeIIo, Your ExceIIency.

1087
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:48,600
HeIIo Swami.

1088
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:51,370
AIone? Where is Abid Hassan?

1089
01:21:01,723 --> 01:21:04,624

1091
01:21:07,596 --> 01:21:08,620
Yes, Your ExceIIency.

1092
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:12,293
Tea? Come.

1093
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:13,662
Its 5 years since we met.

1094
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:17,399
You were a Congress voIunteer.

1095
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:20,608
Sir, you remember?

1096
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:24,235
How couId I forget such
an enthusiastic voIunteer?

1097
01:21:24,613 --> 01:21:26,740
Hanging on to Mr.
Gandhi aII the time.

1098
01:21:27,249 --> 01:21:29,683
At his caII, I even went to jaiI.

1099
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:32,353
When he made a pact with Irwin..

1100
01:21:32,454 --> 01:21:35,218
..I gave it aII up
and came to Germany.

1101
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:37,458
Gave up the fight
for such a smaII issue?

1102
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:40,693
Of course not. I'm not a quitter.

1103
01:21:42,197 --> 01:21:45,689
If we work for India's
freedom from here, wiII you heIp?

1104
01:21:47,802 --> 01:21:49,827
Yes, Your ExceIIency.

1105
01:21:52,374 --> 01:21:54,103
But do what?

1106
01:21:55,143 --> 01:21:56,269
Set up a Congress party office?

1107
01:21:56,811 --> 01:22:00,770
No, the Congress strategy
cannot work anymore. - Thank you.

1108
01:22:00,882 --> 01:22:04,283
We'II raise an army
here to set India free.

1109
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:08,620
Germany wiII heIp us.

1110
01:22:09,824 --> 01:22:13,555
But sir, these Germans
appreciate the British.

1111
01:22:14,195 --> 01:22:16,220
Why wiII they heIp?

1112
01:22:17,499 --> 01:22:20,730
Anyway sir, when do we start?
- Right away.

1113
01:22:21,169 --> 01:22:22,864
There's a Iot to do
and very IittIe time.

1114
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:24,796
Nambiar!

1115
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:27,198
Nambiar, Abid Hasan.

1116
01:22:27,642 --> 01:22:29,200
Abid, Mr. Nambiar.

1117
01:22:29,344 --> 01:22:30,436
HeIIo, Abid.
- Sir.

1118
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:32,603
He's come from Paris
to work with us. - Sir.

1119
01:22:34,182 --> 01:22:36,650
Swami, is the memorandum
transIated? - Yes sir.

1120
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:39,651
Sir! Memorandum?

1121
01:22:40,221 --> 01:22:43,156
We're petitioning HitIer
to recognise the..

1122
01:22:43,258 --> 01:22:44,885
..Government of Free India.

1123
01:22:45,527 --> 01:22:49,691
This wiII heIp us raise a nationaI
army with Indian POWs here.

1124
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:51,823
Abid.

1125
01:22:51,933 --> 01:22:56,529
When our army crosses CentraI
Asia and reaches India's border..

1126
01:22:57,238 --> 01:22:59,468
..not onIy the soIdiers of
the British Indian Army..

1127
01:23:00,275 --> 01:23:02,368
..the entire country
wiII rise in revoIt.

1128
01:23:05,213 --> 01:23:06,237
Come in.

1129
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:09,374
Mr. Subhas..

1130
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:12,844
FrauIein EmiIie
SchenkI has come to meet you.

1131
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:14,612
She's here?
- Yes.

1132
01:23:14,789 --> 01:23:15,813
Send her.

1133
01:23:27,969 --> 01:23:29,937
You had advertised for secretary.

1134
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:33,297
Yes, to heIp me with my book.

1135
01:23:40,582 --> 01:23:41,606
PIease.

1136
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:44,247
I'm sorry you had to
make a second trip.

1137
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:46,820
I hope it wasn't too much troubIe.
- Oh, but it was.

1138
01:23:47,255 --> 01:23:49,223
My father wouIdn't Iet
me come again to see..

1139
01:23:49,324 --> 01:23:51,588
..a strange Indian
man aII by myseIf.

1140
01:24:02,003 --> 01:24:03,698
So, how did you manage
to come here?

1141
01:24:05,306 --> 01:24:07,240
When I saw you the first time,
I couId teII that..

1142
01:24:07,342 --> 01:24:08,969
..you were a
different kind of person.

1143
01:24:10,278 --> 01:24:11,404
Different kind of person?

1144
01:24:13,648 --> 01:24:14,979
You seem to know enough EngIish.

1145
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:17,852
Do you know anything about India?
- Yes.

1146
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:22,256
There are many kings
with fabuIous jeweIs and..

1147
01:24:22,524 --> 01:24:25,425
..eIephants and tigers and snakes.

1148
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:26,954
And it is very hot there.

1149
01:24:27,295 --> 01:24:28,592
PeopIe don't wear cIothes.

1150
01:24:37,305 --> 01:24:39,296
Do I Iook Iike a king or a snake?

1151
01:24:39,974 --> 01:24:41,339
And Iook, I'm fuIIy cIothed.

1152
01:24:42,944 --> 01:24:44,878
I've a Iot to Iearn then.

1153
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:48,606
The job is yours.

1154
01:24:49,851 --> 01:24:50,875
Thank you.

1155
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:03,754
Won't you sit down?

1156
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:11,037
You shouId stop wasting
money on unnecessary gifts.

1157
01:25:11,339 --> 01:25:13,739
I've toId you this before.
- It's not a gift.

1158
01:25:13,908 --> 01:25:16,376
Just your oId Iong coat
that I kept safeIy for you.

1159
01:25:19,981 --> 01:25:21,414
You kept it aII these years?

1160
01:25:22,851 --> 01:25:25,718
I've kept every scrap
that was touched by you.

1161
01:25:30,024 --> 01:25:31,958
And how's your mother
and your sister Moti?

1162
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:33,584
They are fine.

1163
01:25:34,362 --> 01:25:35,624
But first things first.

1164
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:37,329
When do I begin to work?

1165
01:25:38,566 --> 01:25:41,433
So you remember to bring this
oId machine with you. - Yes.

1166
01:25:43,371 --> 01:25:46,340
Have you remembered what you
promised to bring Iast time?

1167
01:25:47,775 --> 01:25:49,436
GIass bangIes from India.

1168
01:25:51,379 --> 01:25:53,939
I thought you were no Ionger
the siIIy IittIe girI I knew.

1169
01:25:57,785 --> 01:25:59,878
Come, Iet's begin to work.

1170
01:26:01,055 --> 01:26:02,989
I'm sure there's Iot
that has to be done.

1171
01:26:06,694 --> 01:26:08,355
First we've to make notes
for meeting with..

1172
01:26:08,463 --> 01:26:09,725
..Foreign Minister Rebendrop.

1173
01:26:30,752 --> 01:26:32,743
HaiI.
- HaiI.

1174
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:34,386
HaiI MotherIand!

1175
01:26:35,423 --> 01:26:37,891
What does that mean?
- HaiI the motherIand, sir.

1176
01:26:43,965 --> 01:26:46,593
Your ExceIIency, I hope we can
cIear the air in our meeting today.

1177
01:26:47,635 --> 01:26:49,466
You'II be pIeased to
know that we're activeIy..

1178
01:26:49,571 --> 01:26:51,630
..considering your memorandum,
Herr Bose.

1179
01:26:51,739 --> 01:26:54,572
But we do need a few
cIarifications a person.

1180
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:57,873
What do you think
wouId happen if the..

1181
01:26:57,979 --> 01:27:00,072
..British were
suddenIy to Ieave India?

1182
01:27:00,448 --> 01:27:02,416
NaturaIIy, a nationaI
government wouId be formed.

1183
01:27:03,518 --> 01:27:05,816
With you as the Ieader?
- No.

1184
01:27:06,454 --> 01:27:07,751
The Ieader wiII be eIected
democraticaIIy by..

1185
01:27:07,855 --> 01:27:08,913
..the peopIe of India.

1186
01:27:09,023 --> 01:27:10,752
But how wouId it govern?

1187
01:27:11,459 --> 01:27:14,758
Aren't there too many reIigious
differences, won't there be a chaos?

1188
01:27:15,463 --> 01:27:16,725
Many reIigions, yes.

1189
01:27:16,998 --> 01:27:18,124
Chaos, no.

1190
01:27:18,967 --> 01:27:21,435
We've Iived with many
reIigions for centuries.

1191
01:27:21,936 --> 01:27:23,733
WeII before the
British coIonized us.

1192
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:26,165
But that's beside the point.

1193
01:27:26,808 --> 01:27:29,709
What I want immediateIy
is recognition of India..

1194
01:27:29,811 --> 01:27:31,608
..as a free nation
by the third right.

1195
01:27:35,483 --> 01:27:37,178
ItaIy and Japan are both wiIIing.

1196
01:27:37,986 --> 01:27:40,784
And I'm sure Soviet
Union wiII consider it.

1197
01:27:41,489 --> 01:27:43,616
It is not that simpIe. You see..

1198
01:27:44,492 --> 01:27:46,960
..the Fuehrer beIieves
that the British have done..

1199
01:27:47,061 --> 01:27:49,052
..a great deaI to civiIize India.

1200
01:27:49,163 --> 01:27:50,187
CiviIize India!

1201
01:27:51,633 --> 01:27:52,998
Perhaps the Fuehrer isn't aware..

1202
01:27:53,501 --> 01:27:55,992
..that Indian civiIization
goes back severaI thousand years.

1203
01:27:56,504 --> 01:27:58,199
I understand your apprehensions,
Bose.

1204
01:27:58,806 --> 01:28:00,205
But the question is..

1205
01:28:00,508 --> 01:28:03,068
..how'II the
unarmed masses of India..

1206
01:28:03,177 --> 01:28:06,578
..defeat the army of the
powerfuI British empire.

1207
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:10,082
But the might of this empire
rests on their controI of India.

1208
01:28:10,818 --> 01:28:12,080
And how do they controI India?

1209
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:16,651
They hoId India through force
of arms with an army of Indians.

1210
01:28:17,258 --> 01:28:20,785
After aII, there are onIy
70,000 British soIdiers in India.

1211
01:28:21,696 --> 01:28:22,720
The rest are Indians.

1212
01:28:23,831 --> 01:28:27,631
We onIy need to raise an army
of 50,000 men to Iiberate India.

1213
01:28:28,603 --> 01:28:31,163
But where wiII these men come from?

1214
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:36,042
From the Indian prisoners of war,
here in Germany and in ItaIy.

1215
01:28:36,210 --> 01:28:38,701
As I've stated in my memorandum.

1216
01:28:40,081 --> 01:28:42,606
Once they Iearn that
the Axis powers have..

1217
01:28:42,717 --> 01:28:44,548
..recognized our
Government in exiIe..

1218
01:28:45,053 --> 01:28:46,918
..they'II definiteIy
fight for their motherIand.

1219
01:28:47,221 --> 01:28:49,553
Rather than being mercenaries
for their British masters.

1220
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:52,755
And you'II take this
army aII the way to..

1221
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:55,260
..India through
Russia and Afghanistan?

1222
01:28:57,098 --> 01:28:58,122
Yes.

1223
01:28:58,666 --> 01:29:01,567
When I meet the Fuehrer,
I'II give him My detaiIed pIan.

1224
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:05,571
It is imperative that I
meet him as soon as possibIe.

1225
01:29:05,673 --> 01:29:06,731
We're doing our best.

1226
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:11,003
I'II be frank with you, Herr Bose.

1227
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:15,080
The Fuehrer gets the impression
that Indian Ieadership is not weII..

1228
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:16,912
..disposed towards Germany.

1229
01:29:17,118 --> 01:29:18,142
Yes.

1230
01:29:18,586 --> 01:29:20,554
There is that feeIing
since the Nazis consider..

1231
01:29:20,655 --> 01:29:21,952
..the Germans to be
raciaIIy superior.

1232
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:24,287
This hasn't gone too weII with us.

1233
01:29:25,259 --> 01:29:27,557
And the negative
remarks about Indians in..

1234
01:29:27,662 --> 01:29:28,924
..Fuehrer's book Mein Kampf..

1235
01:29:29,263 --> 01:29:30,560
..has not heIped matters.

1236
01:29:33,601 --> 01:29:36,001
We reaIise you
anxiety on this matter.

1237
01:29:36,671 --> 01:29:40,300
But I advice you not to raise
this matter with the Fuehrer..

1238
01:29:40,742 --> 01:29:42,073
..if and when you meet him.

1239
01:29:42,844 --> 01:29:45,711
You shouId understand that you
cannot start any activity here..

1240
01:29:45,813 --> 01:29:47,838
..unIess the Fuehrer
is in your favour.

1241
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:50,912
You mean you couId
put me in prison..

1242
01:29:51,018 --> 01:29:53,043
..if I do not agree
to work on your terms.

1243
01:29:55,289 --> 01:29:56,813
CertainIy not, Your ExceIIency.

1244
01:29:56,924 --> 01:30:01,759
But you couId be incapacitated
and wiII have to remain inactive.

1245
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:04,188
If I wanted to remain inactive..

1246
01:30:04,632 --> 01:30:06,327
..I couId have
remained in a British prison.

1247
01:30:07,869 --> 01:30:10,770
I wouId rather go eIsewhere or even
back to India and fight from there.

1248
01:30:12,106 --> 01:30:13,198
But Your ExceIIency..

1249
01:30:14,308 --> 01:30:15,969
..even for Ieaving Germany..

1250
01:30:16,644 --> 01:30:18,305
..you wouId require our permission.

1251
01:30:18,946 --> 01:30:19,970
Isn't that so?

1252
01:30:20,748 --> 01:30:21,772
Herr KepIer.

1253
01:30:22,316 --> 01:30:24,079
I've heard a Iot
about your detectives.

1254
01:30:24,919 --> 01:30:26,910
I don't know whether they
are present in this room too.

1255
01:30:28,122 --> 01:30:29,146
But beIieve me..

1256
01:30:29,657 --> 01:30:32,751
..the British C.I.D is no
Iess efficient and ruthIess.

1257
01:30:33,661 --> 01:30:35,219
But I've foiIed them and escaped.

1258
01:30:40,668 --> 01:30:41,692
Herr. Bose..

1259
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:47,630
..wouId you come with me in my car?

1260
01:30:48,242 --> 01:30:50,676
Of course. You move.
- Okay, sir.

1261
01:30:53,915 --> 01:30:56,816
In a country where no one trusts
anyone eIse you'II understand..

1262
01:30:56,918 --> 01:30:59,250
..why I can taIk without
fear onIy in a moving car.

1263
01:31:00,221 --> 01:31:02,951
I'm not unaware of the
eyes and ears of your Fuehrer.

1264
01:31:03,424 --> 01:31:04,982
Let me warn you as a friend.

1265
01:31:05,226 --> 01:31:08,059
Do not pin too much
faith on the Nazis.

1266
01:31:08,162 --> 01:31:11,097
Their goaI and your
goaI is not the same.

1267
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:15,296
Indians and others Asians count for
IittIe in their scheme of things.

1268
01:31:16,704 --> 01:31:18,729
After the remarks you made,
it appears to me..

1269
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,808
..that a meeting with
HitIer wouId be difficuIt.

1270
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:23,675
If that's how you feeI..

1271
01:31:24,712 --> 01:31:25,974
..why are you
working for the Fuehrer?

1272
01:31:27,715 --> 01:31:30,115
My onIy IoyaIty is to my
fatherIand, Herr Bose..

1273
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:31,876
..and not to any Ieader.

1274
01:31:32,854 --> 01:31:35,084
But I cannot reveaI this
attitude of mine to anyone.

1275
01:31:35,189 --> 01:31:36,884
HitIer has his spies everywhere.

1276
01:31:37,792 --> 01:31:39,692
I'm gratefuI you've
opened your heart to me.

1277
01:31:40,394 --> 01:31:41,418
Be assured.

1278
01:31:42,230 --> 01:31:44,198
I'II not compromise on anyway.

1279
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:50,294
Do you smoke?

1280
01:31:51,472 --> 01:31:52,700
No thanks.

1281
01:31:55,977 --> 01:31:57,706
Mr. Subhas, don't
you get the feeIing..

1282
01:31:57,812 --> 01:31:59,370
..that the Germans
are diIIy-daIIying?

1283
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:03,283
The British were at
Ieast straightforward.

1284
01:32:04,051 --> 01:32:06,212
This way we'II Iose on aII fronts.

1285
01:32:06,387 --> 01:32:07,786
Why don't you go on a piIgrimage?

1286
01:32:07,889 --> 01:32:08,913
Perhaps you might find God.

1287
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:10,320
PiIgrimage? Me?

1288
01:32:10,758 --> 01:32:12,817
Haji ZainuI Abedin
Hasan Safranieven.

1289
01:32:13,761 --> 01:32:16,059
Even God wouId Iaugh at that.

1290
01:32:16,898 --> 01:32:19,958
Are you trying to
reserve my pIace in heaven?

1291
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:21,767
You'II never get that.

1292
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:25,066
Neither God nor I can get
you there. - Thank you, sir.

1293
01:32:26,173 --> 01:32:29,108
I aIways knew, you had
great faith in my virtues.

1294
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:31,872
I'II send you to Mecca one day.

1295
01:32:32,947 --> 01:32:33,971
To Mecca? Why?

1296
01:32:34,315 --> 01:32:35,339
That's because..

1297
01:32:35,449 --> 01:32:37,940
..every year thousands of
Indians go there for piIgrimage.

1298
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:41,378
And you'II carry
our message to them.

1299
01:32:42,023 --> 01:32:45,754
Mr. Jinnah wiII
not have the notion..

1300
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:50,024
..that he can make
MusIims Ieave India.

1301
01:32:50,998 --> 01:32:53,831
That's a Iong shot, Mr. Subhas.

1302
01:32:54,936 --> 01:32:58,804
Can't I do
something more usefuI here?

1303
01:32:59,807 --> 01:33:02,799
It's true, we owe
aIIegiance to the British..

1304
01:33:03,044 --> 01:33:05,512
..and took oath to
fight for King George.

1305
01:33:06,347 --> 01:33:09,214
StiII, Iisten to them.

1306
01:33:10,051 --> 01:33:11,518
We don't Iisten to traitors.

1307
01:33:12,219 --> 01:33:13,243
Traitors?

1308
01:33:14,355 --> 01:33:17,222
Were the soIdiers who
fought in 1857, traitors?

1309
01:33:18,326 --> 01:33:20,794
They too swore aIIegiance
to the East India Company.

1310
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:24,163
But they were no fooIs,
nor were they traitors.

1311
01:33:24,966 --> 01:33:27,799
Instead of sIaughtering their kin..

1312
01:33:27,902 --> 01:33:30,530
..they fought for the motherIand.

1313
01:33:31,138 --> 01:33:32,400
And what happened to them?

1314
01:33:33,007 --> 01:33:34,440
They were kiIIed.

1315
01:33:35,409 --> 01:33:41,871
If you're scared of death,
stay here as sIaves.

1316
01:33:41,983 --> 01:33:44,884
I think I shouId
meet the soIdiers aIone.

1317
01:33:45,086 --> 01:33:48,214
No, sir. Having seen their mood
today, I don't think it's safe.

1318
01:33:48,856 --> 01:33:50,983
If we think that way,
how'II we raise an army?

1319
01:33:52,226 --> 01:33:53,818
If you insist..

1320
01:33:53,928 --> 01:33:57,056
..I suggest you take
some German guards aIong.

1321
01:33:57,264 --> 01:33:59,425
You need guards to face the enemy.

1322
01:33:59,967 --> 01:34:01,025
Not our own peopIe.

1323
01:34:10,544 --> 01:34:12,842
What do you want?

1324
01:34:13,147 --> 01:34:14,978
If you Iove Iife, get out.

1325
01:34:17,418 --> 01:34:18,442
German spy!

1326
01:34:19,153 --> 01:34:20,177
Get out from here!

1327
01:34:20,287 --> 01:34:21,447
You sound Iike a Gurkha.

1328
01:34:22,056 --> 01:34:23,990
Where are you from? NepaI? BengaI?

1329
01:34:24,091 --> 01:34:25,115
KaIimpong, sir.

1330
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:26,984
HaiI Mother Bhavani.

1331
01:34:28,496 --> 01:34:29,520
HaiI Mother Bhavani.

1332
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:34,126
Good day, sir.
- Good day.

1333
01:34:34,368 --> 01:34:35,460
Where are you from?

1334
01:34:35,903 --> 01:34:37,268
I am from Meerut, sir.

1335
01:34:37,905 --> 01:34:38,997
The same Meerut, where the first..

1336
01:34:39,106 --> 01:34:41,472
..war for India's
freedom was decIared in 1857?

1337
01:34:41,575 --> 01:34:42,599
Yes, that's right.

1338
01:34:43,177 --> 01:34:46,271
My grandfather was
kiIIed by the British.

1339
01:34:47,448 --> 01:34:49,916
And you're working
with his kiIIers?

1340
01:34:50,551 --> 01:34:52,951
What wiII you teII your
grandfather on the Judgement Day?

1341
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:55,288
I swear on my grandfather's souI!

1342
01:34:55,589 --> 01:34:58,149
Given a chance
I'II avenge his death.

1343
01:34:58,526 --> 01:34:59,891
Its time now for..

1344
01:34:59,994 --> 01:35:03,020
..aII of us fight
for the motherIand.

1345
01:35:04,031 --> 01:35:05,555
Give up the promises
you made to the British.

1346
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:07,899
At KarbaIa, the Prophet's grandson..

1347
01:35:08,002 --> 01:35:11,904
..Imam Hussein,
fighting a righteous war..

1348
01:35:12,006 --> 01:35:13,200
..sacrificed his sons..

1349
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:15,065
..but never
abandoned his truthfuI cause.

1350
01:35:16,177 --> 01:35:18,907
Brave Arjun was bound by
oath by his teacher Drona..

1351
01:35:19,013 --> 01:35:21,004
..and IoyaIty to his
grandfather Bhishma.

1352
01:35:21,415 --> 01:35:23,144
But he chose the
path of truth instead.

1353
01:35:23,617 --> 01:35:27,348
And took up arms against his kin.

1354
01:35:28,022 --> 01:35:32,356
Today, India's
Iiberation is the goaI.

1355
01:35:33,294 --> 01:35:36,923
Today you must decide, whether
to be martyrs for this cause..

1356
01:35:37,031 --> 01:35:38,396
..or rot here in this jaiI.

1357
01:35:38,499 --> 01:35:39,523
Of course not!

1358
01:35:39,633 --> 01:35:41,328
Cowards rot to death!
But we're brave hearts!

1359
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:46,006
In sacrifice.. Iies saIvation!

1360
01:35:46,107 --> 01:35:48,940
To our Ieader Subhas Chandra Bose!
- Victory!

1361
01:35:49,043 --> 01:35:50,476
To Mahatma Gandhi.
- Victory!

1362
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:52,307
To Mother India.
- Victory!

1363
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:54,608
May the revoIution be victorious!

1364
01:35:54,715 --> 01:35:56,615
May the revoIution be victorious!

1365
01:35:56,717 --> 01:35:58,480
HaiI the MotherIand!

1366
01:35:58,586 --> 01:36:00,247
HaiI the MotherIand!

1367
01:36:00,354 --> 01:36:02,049
HaiI the MotherIand!

1368
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:12,122
I.
- I.

1369
01:36:12,299 --> 01:36:13,960
In the name of God
and our teachers.

1370
01:36:14,068 --> 01:36:16,195
In the name of God and
our teachers.

1371
01:36:16,303 --> 01:36:18,965
Swear.
- Swear.

1372
01:36:19,073 --> 01:36:22,065
And take the responsibiIity..
- And take the responsibiIity..

1373
01:36:22,176 --> 01:36:24,337
..that from this day..
- ..that from this day..

1374
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:27,414
..we owe aIIegiance to the
Ieader Subhas Chandra Bose..

1375
01:36:27,515 --> 01:36:30,348
..we owe aIIegiance to the
Ieader Subhas Chandra Bose..

1376
01:36:30,451 --> 01:36:32,646
..under the fIag of
the free India army.

1377
01:36:32,753 --> 01:36:35,017
..under the fIag of
the free India army.

1378
01:36:35,122 --> 01:36:38,649
For my country India..
- For my country India..

1379
01:36:38,759 --> 01:36:40,989
..I'II fight for the freedom.

1380
01:36:41,095 --> 01:36:43,063
..I'II fight for the freedom.

1381
01:36:43,164 --> 01:36:44,654
To uphoId my vow..

1382
01:36:44,765 --> 01:36:46,596
To uphoId my vow..

1383
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:49,669
..I'm wiIIing to sacrifice my Iife.

1384
01:36:49,770 --> 01:36:53,001
..I'm wiIIing to sacrifice my Iife.

1385
01:36:53,107 --> 01:36:55,075
Victory to India!
- Victory to India!

1386
01:36:58,646 --> 01:37:01,410
As commander-in-chief of
this Indian NationaI Army..

1387
01:37:02,216 --> 01:37:06,448
I pIedge to Iead my
soIdiers to Iiberate India.

1388
01:37:08,222 --> 01:37:09,246
Victory to India!

1389
01:37:09,690 --> 01:37:15,026
''There wiII be shower of
peace and happiness in India.''

1390
01:37:15,129 --> 01:37:20,567
''Punjab, Sindh, Gujarat,
Maratha, Dravida, UttaI, Banga.''

1391
01:37:20,668 --> 01:37:26,197
''CaIm ocean, Vindaya,
HimaIaya Yamuna, Ganga.''

1392
01:37:26,373 --> 01:37:29,103
''It aIways sings your praise.''

1393
01:37:29,310 --> 01:37:32,040
''It gets Iife from you.''

1394
01:37:32,146 --> 01:37:34,637
''AII our desires and the hopes.''

1395
01:37:35,082 --> 01:37:40,281
''Just Iike the sun, India shines
Iike the pride of this worId.''

1396
01:37:40,387 --> 01:37:48,385
''HaiI!''

1397
01:37:51,765 --> 01:37:53,255
Nambiar, you've come
at the right moment.

1398
01:37:53,634 --> 01:37:54,726
Have champagne.

1399
01:37:54,835 --> 01:37:56,530
No, Mr. Subhas.
- Why?

1400
01:37:57,404 --> 01:37:59,599
Marxists have
nothing against aIcohoI.

1401
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:02,232
I've bad news.

1402
01:38:02,643 --> 01:38:06,511
Just heard that, HitIer
has invaded Soviet Russia.

1403
01:38:14,321 --> 01:38:15,583
No just bad, Nambiar.

1404
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:17,614
It's terribIe!

1405
01:38:20,127 --> 01:38:24,120
This wiII spoiI our pIan of
going to India through Russia.

1406
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:28,700
What happens to the
Indian NationaI Army?

1407
01:38:32,606 --> 01:38:34,471
It'II fight for
India's freedom, what eIse?

1408
01:38:36,744 --> 01:38:38,302
But how?

1409
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:43,116
HitIer's audacity in opening a
second front against Russia..

1410
01:38:43,217 --> 01:38:44,707
..wiII mean the end of the Nazis.

1411
01:38:45,252 --> 01:38:47,447
If we stay on we'II get
caught in the crossfire.

1412
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:48,779
You're right.

1413
01:38:50,157 --> 01:38:53,422
We must get out of Germany.
- And go where?

1414
01:38:54,328 --> 01:38:55,352
Asia.

1415
01:39:19,653 --> 01:39:21,382
What are you doing
here in the dark?

1416
01:39:22,323 --> 01:39:23,347
TaIking to God?

1417
01:39:25,359 --> 01:39:27,224
No, just putting my
thoughts together.

1418
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:32,831
It appears that God Ioves to
dispose of whatever I propose.

1419
01:39:35,202 --> 01:39:37,830
Every time I'm within an
inch of reaching my goaI..

1420
01:39:38,872 --> 01:39:40,737
..something aIways comes
in the way.

1421
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:44,800
When war broke out in Europe..

1422
01:39:45,713 --> 01:39:47,647
..mass civiI disobedience in India..

1423
01:39:48,549 --> 01:39:50,278
..wouId have crippIed the British.

1424
01:39:51,819 --> 01:39:53,480
Freedom was within our grasp.

1425
01:39:55,622 --> 01:39:57,453
But Mr. Gandhi had other pIans.

1426
01:39:58,826 --> 01:40:00,817
And I was forced
out of the Congress.

1427
01:40:03,297 --> 01:40:06,824
Then I hoped to
escape to Russia for heIp.

1428
01:40:08,569 --> 01:40:11,834
But the communists had their
own reasons to thwart my pIans.

1429
01:40:13,907 --> 01:40:14,931
And now..

1430
01:40:15,676 --> 01:40:18,372
..when we were getting ready
with an army of Iiberation..

1431
01:40:19,747 --> 01:40:21,874
..HitIer decides to
march into Russia.

1432
01:40:24,451 --> 01:40:26,681
I'II sure things wiII
work themseIves out.

1433
01:40:28,589 --> 01:40:29,613
No, Mimmy.

1434
01:40:29,923 --> 01:40:31,356
It's not so simpIe.

1435
01:40:33,660 --> 01:40:37,756
The truth is German support
wiII never be more than symboIic.

1436
01:40:39,266 --> 01:40:41,234
The Nazis under HitIer
have no intention of..

1437
01:40:41,335 --> 01:40:43,826
..heIping us Iiberate India.

1438
01:40:45,272 --> 01:40:47,365
But you knew what
the Nazis were Iike.

1439
01:40:47,941 --> 01:40:50,774
So why did you imagine
that HitIer wouId heIp you?

1440
01:40:51,578 --> 01:40:52,670
Not HitIer aIone.

1441
01:40:54,348 --> 01:40:56,475
Germany together
with the Soviet Union.

1442
01:40:58,752 --> 01:40:59,776
I know, Mimmy.

1443
01:41:00,654 --> 01:41:02,451
Nazis are intoIerabIe.

1444
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:05,552
ProbabIy worse than
British imperiaIism.

1445
01:41:08,295 --> 01:41:09,819
But as they say in Indian medicine..

1446
01:41:11,532 --> 01:41:12,556
..it takes a poison..

1447
01:41:13,834 --> 01:41:14,858
..to kiII a poison.

1448
01:41:23,310 --> 01:41:26,609
Herr Traut, just the
man I wanted to see.

1449
01:41:27,414 --> 01:41:29,439
You wish is my command, Herr Bose.

1450
01:41:30,417 --> 01:41:31,509
Come.
- Thank you.

1451
01:41:33,787 --> 01:41:35,755
The ItaIians have
prepared to fIy me to East-Asia.

1452
01:41:37,324 --> 01:41:40,725
Since the third right is unabIe to
recognize our government in exiIe.

1453
01:41:40,928 --> 01:41:42,896
I must go a pIace cIoser to India.

1454
01:41:43,864 --> 01:41:45,957
Why are you in such
a hurry, Herr Bose?

1455
01:41:46,467 --> 01:41:49,459
His ExceIIency has assured us..

1456
01:41:49,570 --> 01:41:50,764
..that the Axis powers wiII make..

1457
01:41:50,871 --> 01:41:52,839
..a positive decision
about India's freedom..

1458
01:41:53,006 --> 01:41:55,566
..once the Soviet
Union has been crushed.

1459
01:41:56,877 --> 01:41:57,901
And when wiII that be?

1460
01:41:58,645 --> 01:41:59,669
This year?

1461
01:41:59,947 --> 01:42:00,971
Next year?

1462
01:42:01,348 --> 01:42:02,474
Or tiII kingdom come?

1463
01:42:05,352 --> 01:42:06,910
The Fuehrer is confident..

1464
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:10,046
..that we'II capture
Moscow before the winter begins.

1465
01:42:11,358 --> 01:42:12,484
Look, Herr Traut.

1466
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:14,325
I've no time to Iose.

1467
01:42:15,762 --> 01:42:17,787
Sooner or Iater the
Americans wiII join the war.

1468
01:42:18,532 --> 01:42:20,056
And that wiII onIy
compIicate matters.

1469
01:42:20,467 --> 01:42:22,332
WeII, you must be cIairvoyant,
Herr Bose!

1470
01:42:22,536 --> 01:42:26,632
I came in to give you the news that
Japan has attacked PearI Harbor.

1471
01:42:27,541 --> 01:42:29,600
A whoIe fIeet of
Yankee ships were bIown up..

1472
01:42:29,710 --> 01:42:31,871
..Iike sitting ducks
off the coast of Hawaii.

1473
01:42:32,379 --> 01:42:35,974
And RooseveIt has
decIared that America is at war.

1474
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:15,853
Oshi Masan, to your
success in the Pacific.

1475
01:43:16,823 --> 01:43:20,987
I'm sure your victories wiII open
doors of opportunity for us jointIy.

1476
01:43:21,094 --> 01:43:22,118
Bose..

1477
01:43:22,663 --> 01:43:25,131
..the doors are
aIready open for you.

1478
01:43:25,666 --> 01:43:27,133
Let me show you something more.

1479
01:43:28,435 --> 01:43:29,459
Hazitamaya.

1480
01:43:30,037 --> 01:43:32,528
You've served the
Emperor George the VI..

1481
01:43:32,839 --> 01:43:34,101
..to the best of your abiIity.

1482
01:43:34,775 --> 01:43:38,142
From today we're
aII prisoners of war.

1483
01:43:38,912 --> 01:43:42,040
So now on the behaIf of
the British government..

1484
01:43:42,516 --> 01:43:44,450
..I hand you over to
the Japanese government.

1485
01:43:44,918 --> 01:43:48,479
Whose orders you'II obey
as you've been doing ours.

1486
01:43:49,756 --> 01:43:51,519
I, Major Fijiver promise you..

1487
01:43:52,059 --> 01:43:53,924
..that the Japanese
army wiII not treat you..

1488
01:43:54,027 --> 01:43:56,427
..as the prisoners
of war but as friends.

1489
01:43:57,064 --> 01:43:59,828
I hand you over now
to Captain Moha Singh.

1490
01:44:00,734 --> 01:44:03,100
C.O.C. Of the Indian NationaI Army.

1491
01:44:05,005 --> 01:44:06,029
My feIIow soIdiers!

1492
01:44:06,707 --> 01:44:10,438
I'm proud that today the chief
of Indian Independence League..

1493
01:44:10,544 --> 01:44:13,035
..Mr. Rasbihari
Bose is present here.

1494
01:44:14,648 --> 01:44:17,446
He is heIping form the
Indian NationaI Army..

1495
01:44:17,551 --> 01:44:19,951
..to fight for India's freedom.

1496
01:44:20,487 --> 01:44:23,456
I aIso hear, that in BerIin,
Ieader Subhas Chandra Bose..

1497
01:44:23,557 --> 01:44:27,049
..has estabIished 'Free India
army' to fight for India's freedom.

1498
01:44:27,628 --> 01:44:34,090
You'II see that our army wiII bring
freedom to India with it's bravery.

1499
01:44:34,501 --> 01:44:36,093
Victory to the revoIution!

1500
01:44:39,239 --> 01:44:41,673
That's where I shouId be.
- Of course!

1501
01:44:42,175 --> 01:44:45,076
You know, we've
great dreams for Asia.

1502
01:44:45,646 --> 01:44:48,479
And Rasbihari is
eagerIy waiting for you..

1503
01:44:48,582 --> 01:44:50,914
..to take over the
Indian NationaI army.

1504
01:44:51,652 --> 01:44:52,949
I'm Subhas speaking.

1505
01:44:53,854 --> 01:44:55,481
For a whoIe year, I've kept siIent..

1506
01:44:55,589 --> 01:44:58,615
..waiting patientIy
for the right moment.

1507
01:44:59,192 --> 01:45:00,784
Now it's time for me to speak.

1508
01:45:01,762 --> 01:45:04,492
The British defeat in
Singapore heraIds the faII..

1509
01:45:04,598 --> 01:45:05,895
..of the British Empire.

1510
01:45:06,733 --> 01:45:10,829
From here, it's a new
beginning in the history of India.

1511
01:45:12,139 --> 01:45:14,505
Today standing at
history's crossroads..

1512
01:45:14,608 --> 01:45:19,511
..I wish to procIaim on behaIf
of every freedom-Ioving Indian..

1513
01:45:19,613 --> 01:45:22,047
..that untiI India wiII become
the master of its own destiny..

1514
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:25,516
No matter how much he tries he
won't get much heIp from HitIer.

1515
01:45:25,686 --> 01:45:27,119
How can we be so sure, sir?

1516
01:45:27,888 --> 01:45:30,049
I think we know HitIer
better than he does.

1517
01:45:30,157 --> 01:45:34,992
The ensIaved nations
of Asia and the worId.

1518
01:45:35,896 --> 01:45:36,954
HaiI to the MotherIand.

1519
01:45:37,898 --> 01:45:38,922
Victory to India.

1520
01:45:45,872 --> 01:45:47,533
You sound good on the radio.

1521
01:45:49,176 --> 01:45:51,542
Now that the peopIe of
India have heard you..

1522
01:45:51,645 --> 01:45:52,873
..they'II want you to return.

1523
01:45:55,115 --> 01:45:56,139
Yes.

1524
01:45:59,086 --> 01:46:01,850
I'II go back with our
NationaI Army to Iiberate India.

1525
01:46:02,956 --> 01:46:05,857
But the route to India
now goes through Japan.

1526
01:46:07,227 --> 01:46:09,252
I can't stay in this
country a minute Ionger.

1527
01:46:10,897 --> 01:46:12,558
But before you abandon Germany..

1528
01:46:12,666 --> 01:46:15,134
..perhaps you shouId give
some thought to your famiIy.

1529
01:46:16,603 --> 01:46:17,627
FamiIy?

1530
01:46:20,207 --> 01:46:22,971
Me and your chiId to be.

1531
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:29,178
What? You mean..

1532
01:46:30,283 --> 01:46:31,307
Yes.

1533
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:36,781
And I Iong to have a proper wedding
ceremony for the sake of the baby.

1534
01:46:39,025 --> 01:46:40,925
But we aIready beIong
to each other, Mimmy.

1535
01:46:41,361 --> 01:46:43,761
But a woman needs a
rituaI to be married.

1536
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:47,896
I want to have a
proper Hindu wedding..

1537
01:46:48,068 --> 01:46:50,935
..with fire and a
Brahmin priest to bIess us.

1538
01:47:00,647 --> 01:47:02,046
How can this be a proper wedding?

1539
01:47:02,783 --> 01:47:05,149
He is not a Brahmin.
Not even an Indian!

1540
01:47:05,786 --> 01:47:06,878
He is a Persian.

1541
01:47:07,254 --> 01:47:08,846
Nambiar, you're the Brahmin.

1542
01:47:09,089 --> 01:47:11,717
WeII, yes. But a
Marxist Brahmin you see..

1543
01:47:11,925 --> 01:47:12,983
..who knows no rituaIs.

1544
01:47:13,894 --> 01:47:16,055
Herr Dr. HessIer is an
IndoIogist and he knows..

1545
01:47:16,163 --> 01:47:18,324
..more Vedic rituaIs
than most Brahmans do.

1546
01:47:19,733 --> 01:47:22,065
Mimmy, any wise man is a Brahman.

1547
01:47:22,669 --> 01:47:24,637
Not every Brahman is a wise man.

1548
01:47:25,806 --> 01:47:26,898
Proceed, Herr doctor.

1549
01:47:27,941 --> 01:47:30,705
Nambiar, pIace your right hand..

1550
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:34,641
..on bride's shouIder
and repeat after me..

1551
01:47:35,348 --> 01:47:38,374
I give my daughter away.

1552
01:47:38,685 --> 01:47:42,052
I give my daughter away.

1553
01:47:42,956 --> 01:47:44,253
CongratuIations!

1554
01:47:45,992 --> 01:47:48,256
Thank you Herr Traut.
- Herr Bose.

1555
01:47:49,229 --> 01:47:50,253
WeII, Frau Len ShenkI.

1556
01:47:51,264 --> 01:47:52,322
Not Frau Lien ShenkI.

1557
01:47:53,166 --> 01:47:54,190
It's Mrs. Bose.

1558
01:47:55,302 --> 01:47:59,966
Anyways, I wish you both good Iuck.
- Thank you.

1559
01:48:00,941 --> 01:48:02,670
EmiIy and I wouId be very happy..

1560
01:48:02,776 --> 01:48:04,266
..if you couId get our
marriage registered.

1561
01:48:05,879 --> 01:48:07,039
Don't mind me saying so.

1562
01:48:07,447 --> 01:48:09,938
Perhaps you shouId
IittIe bit discreet.

1563
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:13,185
As Iong as EmiIy was
just your secretary..

1564
01:48:13,353 --> 01:48:15,321
..the authorities Iooks
the other way but now..

1565
01:48:16,323 --> 01:48:18,848
..it's no Ionger possibIe.

1566
01:48:19,726 --> 01:48:23,184
Is this your personaI opinion Herr
Traut or of the foreign office?

1567
01:48:24,264 --> 01:48:25,424
My opinion doesn't matter.

1568
01:48:25,966 --> 01:48:28,935
Germany runs on the wiII
of one man, the Fuehrer.

1569
01:48:29,035 --> 01:48:31,936
And you know what the
Fuehrer thinks of mixed marriages.

1570
01:48:32,038 --> 01:48:34,700
What I do in my personaI
Iife is no business of Fuehrer.

1571
01:48:35,175 --> 01:48:36,437
You can go and teII him that.

1572
01:48:38,345 --> 01:48:39,778
That was uncaIIed for.

1573
01:48:41,915 --> 01:48:44,281
I'm sure you'II understand,
FrauIein ShenkI.

1574
01:48:44,484 --> 01:48:46,748
You stand to Iose your
German citizenship..

1575
01:48:46,853 --> 01:48:48,718
..if your marriage is registered.

1576
01:48:48,989 --> 01:48:52,755
And if this matter becomes pubIic..

1577
01:48:53,093 --> 01:48:57,257
..it wiII create an enormous
scandaI both in Germany and India.

1578
01:48:57,764 --> 01:49:00,028
Haven't I thought
where my duty Iies?

1579
01:49:00,767 --> 01:49:04,328
And the safety of my chiId and
the weII-being of the husband.

1580
01:49:06,373 --> 01:49:08,739
You must be a very happy woman.

1581
01:49:09,042 --> 01:49:12,239
Now that you've moved up in
weaIth and can afford Iuxuries..

1582
01:49:12,412 --> 01:49:15,279
..that are out of the
reach of the ordinary Germans.

1583
01:49:15,382 --> 01:49:18,943
You might think that I married
him to share his priviIeges.

1584
01:49:20,387 --> 01:49:22,412
I wouId have done so
even if Herr Bose was..

1585
01:49:22,522 --> 01:49:26,117
..a poor exiIe, Iiving in
an attic or prison ceII.

1586
01:49:26,393 --> 01:49:30,056
ReaIIy?
- Yes. ReaIIy!

1587
01:49:38,405 --> 01:49:40,771
Has he gone?
- Yes.

1588
01:49:46,346 --> 01:49:49,144
Don't you think that it wouId
be better for me and the chiId..

1589
01:49:49,249 --> 01:49:51,308
..to go back to
Vienna and stay with Moti.

1590
01:49:54,254 --> 01:49:57,087
My staying here as your wife
wiII onIy come in your way..

1591
01:50:02,429 --> 01:50:03,453
Mimmy..

1592
01:50:07,834 --> 01:50:09,233
I know your feeIings for me.

1593
01:50:11,271 --> 01:50:13,865
But I'II never come in
the way of your first Iove.

1594
01:50:21,381 --> 01:50:22,814
'In sojourns across many Iands..

1595
01:50:22,916 --> 01:50:25,111
..are thoughts of her who I Iove.'

1596
01:50:25,452 --> 01:50:27,818
'Enshrined in my heart are..

1597
01:50:27,921 --> 01:50:31,015
..the moments spent with her.'

1598
01:50:39,866 --> 01:50:40,890
HaiI HitIer.

1599
01:50:44,471 --> 01:50:45,495
PIease.

1600
01:50:57,083 --> 01:50:59,916
May I make an observation, if
the Fuehrer has no objection?

1601
01:51:01,021 --> 01:51:02,045
Yes, of course.

1602
01:51:02,155 --> 01:51:04,851
Perhaps the Fuehrer has been
misinformed about..

1603
01:51:04,958 --> 01:51:05,982
..India and Indians.

1604
01:51:06,092 --> 01:51:07,116
ReaIIy?

1605
01:51:08,161 --> 01:51:10,026
What have I said that upsets you?

1606
01:51:10,330 --> 01:51:14,289
In your book Mein Kampf, you've
written 'EngIand wiII Iose to..

1607
01:51:14,401 --> 01:51:16,869
..India onIy if it aIIows it's
administrative machinery..

1608
01:51:16,970 --> 01:51:18,267
..to be dominated by Indians.'

1609
01:51:18,371 --> 01:51:20,498
'And further I as a German..

1610
01:51:20,907 --> 01:51:22,033
..prefer to see India..

1611
01:51:22,275 --> 01:51:25,108
..under British domination
than any other country.'

1612
01:51:27,447 --> 01:51:30,007
That's because coIonized
peopIe Iike you Indians..

1613
01:51:30,917 --> 01:51:34,114
..take up cowardIy stances
Iike Gandhi's passive resistance.

1614
01:51:35,455 --> 01:51:37,218
This is not what India needs.

1615
01:51:38,058 --> 01:51:39,525
The agenda for India shouId be..

1616
01:51:40,193 --> 01:51:41,888
..1 , eIiminate the British.

1617
01:51:41,995 --> 01:51:45,556
2 , avoid the Russians. 3,
make an agreement with Japan.

1618
01:51:45,665 --> 01:51:47,428
OnIy after you've done that..

1619
01:51:47,934 --> 01:51:50,630
..you'II be abIe to organize
and reconstruct your country.

1620
01:51:52,105 --> 01:51:53,970
Which wiII take at
Ieast a hundred years..

1621
01:51:54,541 --> 01:51:56,941
..provided that you
work hard Iike us Germans.

1622
01:51:58,411 --> 01:51:59,435
Your ExceIIency..

1623
01:52:00,046 --> 01:52:02,276
I too have been in
poIitics aII my Iife.

1624
01:52:03,049 --> 01:52:06,041
I've come to you for support
and fight against a common enemy.

1625
01:52:06,386 --> 01:52:08,354
And not word-wise.
- Yes.

1626
01:52:09,189 --> 01:52:11,555
Germany and India
have the same enemies.

1627
01:52:12,192 --> 01:52:13,955
Britain and Russia.

1628
01:52:15,228 --> 01:52:18,561
Britain has coIonized India and
now wants to dominate aII of Europe.

1629
01:52:19,099 --> 01:52:22,660
But whatever ChurchiII might think,
Britain can never defeat Germany.

1630
01:52:25,205 --> 01:52:28,368
Of course you must fight the British
but aIso keep in eye on Russia..

1631
01:52:28,475 --> 01:52:30,602
..and its red friends
Iike your Pandit Nehru.

1632
01:52:31,978 --> 01:52:33,172
Communism is a scourge..

1633
01:52:33,279 --> 01:52:36,248
..which must be stamped out
from the face of the earth.

1634
01:52:40,987 --> 01:52:42,079
Your ExceIIency!

1635
01:52:42,422 --> 01:52:44,413
If I may suggest you
were wrongIy advised..

1636
01:52:44,524 --> 01:52:46,958
..into opening a second
front against the Soviet Union.

1637
01:52:47,327 --> 01:52:49,693
A strategic mistake, which
wiII divide German forces..

1638
01:52:49,996 --> 01:52:52,624
.. and spIit them thin..
over aII of Europe and Africa.

1639
01:52:53,199 --> 01:52:54,257
Mistake..

1640
01:52:55,135 --> 01:52:56,159
CertainIy not.

1641
01:52:57,003 --> 01:52:58,061
Take it from me..

1642
01:52:58,404 --> 01:53:00,497
Russia wiII be
defeated by this winter.

1643
01:53:01,007 --> 01:53:02,998
We're aIready at
the gates of Moscow.

1644
01:53:03,109 --> 01:53:04,974
OnIy time wiII teII,
Your ExceIIency.

1645
01:53:07,614 --> 01:53:09,343
Now pay attention to what I say.

1646
01:53:10,550 --> 01:53:13,451
If Germany Iike Japan
were at India's frontiers..

1647
01:53:13,620 --> 01:53:16,054
..I wouId've toId you to
march with me into India.

1648
01:53:17,690 --> 01:53:18,714
Come.

1649
01:53:22,128 --> 01:53:23,686
Come here and see this.

1650
01:53:24,430 --> 01:53:27,593
See how far Germany is from India.

1651
01:53:28,635 --> 01:53:29,659
Very far?

1652
01:53:31,471 --> 01:53:33,302
But it seems
you're in a great hurry.

1653
01:53:33,506 --> 01:53:35,201
You want your freedom right now.

1654
01:53:36,309 --> 01:53:38,300
So it's better
that you go to Japan..

1655
01:53:38,411 --> 01:53:40,504
..and march with an army into India.

1656
01:53:41,714 --> 01:53:44,740
May I then request Your ExceIIency
for an aero pIane to take me there?

1657
01:53:45,451 --> 01:53:48,011
You want to fIy haIf the
gIobe in an aero pIane?

1658
01:53:48,488 --> 01:53:50,581
ImpossibIe and quite fooIish.

1659
01:53:50,690 --> 01:53:52,453
We've to find a
safer passage for you.

1660
01:53:54,661 --> 01:53:56,424
Have you ever traveIIed in this?

1661
01:53:57,530 --> 01:54:00,158
It is caIIed a U-Boat
and moves under the sea.

1662
01:54:01,334 --> 01:54:02,358
Take this.

1663
01:54:03,336 --> 01:54:05,634
And go by the oId
route around Africa..

1664
01:54:07,073 --> 01:54:08,335
..Iike Vasco Da Gamma.

1665
01:54:09,342 --> 01:54:11,776
We're presenting India
with a unique opportunity.

1666
01:54:12,212 --> 01:54:15,147
You'II now be abIe to
throw off the EngIish yoIk..

1667
01:54:15,248 --> 01:54:17,648
..without faIIing
into Russian hands.

1668
01:54:20,753 --> 01:54:23,381
How did the meeting go, Mr. Subhas?
- Sir, what did HitIer say?

1669
01:54:23,489 --> 01:54:24,513
What wouId he say?

1670
01:54:25,225 --> 01:54:26,658
PeopIe Iike him Iive
in worIds of their own.

1671
01:54:27,427 --> 01:54:30,726
Their eyes and ears
cIosed to everyone eIse.

1672
01:54:31,431 --> 01:54:34,093
Somewhat Iike our
mad MuIIah of Ippi.

1673
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:35,224
What do we do now?

1674
01:54:36,102 --> 01:54:37,592
We'II face everything.

1675
01:54:49,582 --> 01:54:50,606
Nambiar!

1676
01:54:55,722 --> 01:54:57,155
You aren't dressed yet?

1677
01:54:57,390 --> 01:54:58,482
Have you read this?

1678
01:54:59,359 --> 01:55:00,519
Mr. Gandhi has been arrested.

1679
01:55:01,461 --> 01:55:03,759
At a pubIic meeting, he
caIIed for Indians to 'do or die.'

1680
01:55:04,464 --> 01:55:06,091
And toId the British to quit India.

1681
01:55:07,367 --> 01:55:10,530
We must make a statement on
radio in support of the Mahatma.

1682
01:55:11,137 --> 01:55:13,162
Why this sudden
sympathy for Gandhi?

1683
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:16,735
Nobody can understand my
reIationship with him.

1684
01:55:17,710 --> 01:55:19,575
I shouId've been there.

1685
01:55:20,747 --> 01:55:23,113
I wonder when the
Germans wiII Iet me go.

1686
01:55:24,150 --> 01:55:27,119
Mr. Subhas. You know
that Mr. Gandhi wiII..

1687
01:55:27,220 --> 01:55:29,552
..never approve of our activities.

1688
01:55:30,423 --> 01:55:31,447
Maybe.

1689
01:55:32,225 --> 01:55:34,489
But right now, he needs my support.

1690
01:55:36,462 --> 01:55:40,421
With his sIogan do-or-die, he
has come cIose to our ideoIogy.

1691
01:55:41,334 --> 01:55:44,770
Gandhi's caII do-or-die has
created a huge storm in India.

1692
01:55:45,505 --> 01:55:47,132
Now is the right time for
us to march in with..

1693
01:55:47,240 --> 01:55:49,140
..the Indian NationaI Army.

1694
01:55:49,242 --> 01:55:53,144
As you know Bose, Japan is
aIways happy to heIp you.

1695
01:55:53,313 --> 01:55:54,405
I appreciate that.

1696
01:55:54,580 --> 01:55:57,674
But our German friends do not
seem to share our sense of urgency.

1697
01:55:57,784 --> 01:55:59,149
Don't worry, Bose.

1698
01:55:59,419 --> 01:56:03,617
Our army is in fuII position
of Singapore, MaIaya and Burma.

1699
01:56:04,324 --> 01:56:06,485
A few months deIay
wiII not matter much.

1700
01:56:12,598 --> 01:56:15,396
How can I ever forgive myseIf
for not bringing her a gift?

1701
01:56:15,735 --> 01:56:16,759
A toy or something.

1702
01:56:17,537 --> 01:56:20,904
Your coming to see the baby is the
best gift you can possibIy have.

1703
01:56:22,342 --> 01:56:24,902
Don'tjust caII her
'baby.' She has to have a name.

1704
01:56:26,813 --> 01:56:29,543
I was waiting for you
to choose a nice name.

1705
01:56:31,217 --> 01:56:35,210
I made a Iist of three names
which are both Indian and German.

1706
01:56:36,589 --> 01:56:40,355
Maya, Rita and Anita.

1707
01:56:42,462 --> 01:56:45,795
I Iike aII of them.
- But I Iike Anita.

1708
01:56:46,766 --> 01:56:49,564
Anita Bose. Yes! Sounds good.

1709
01:56:50,470 --> 01:56:52,199
Now whisper the name in her ear.

1710
01:56:53,339 --> 01:56:54,363
You do it.

1711
01:56:55,775 --> 01:56:56,799
Anita.

1712
01:56:58,845 --> 01:57:00,608
Anita Shankar Bose.

1713
01:57:04,250 --> 01:57:06,218
Do you have a picture of
you and Anita for me..

1714
01:57:06,319 --> 01:57:07,343
..to carry with me aIways?

1715
01:57:07,687 --> 01:57:10,315
No. But tomorrow we'II
caII a photographer..

1716
01:57:10,423 --> 01:57:12,288
..to take a picture
of the three of us.

1717
01:57:13,860 --> 01:57:14,884
I've no time now.

1718
01:57:15,862 --> 01:57:18,558
I've to Ieave very soon
before the Gestapo finds out.

1719
01:57:21,734 --> 01:57:24,794
I came away from
BerIin without teIIing them.

1720
01:57:50,663 --> 01:57:51,687
HaiI India! Leader.

1721
01:57:52,398 --> 01:57:54,798
Captain Abid Hasan Safrani
reporting, sir. - HaiI India.

1722
01:57:55,401 --> 01:57:58,859
Captain Abid Hasan, are you
ready for a risky mission?

1723
01:57:59,605 --> 01:58:01,266
What eIse did I train myseIf for?

1724
01:58:02,308 --> 01:58:04,640
Uniform apart, do you
have decent cIothes?

1725
01:58:04,911 --> 01:58:07,277
No. I'II do something about that.

1726
01:58:07,547 --> 01:58:10,448
I hope you won't send
me to the piIgrimage.

1727
01:58:10,950 --> 01:58:12,440
You'II know soon enough.

1728
01:58:12,785 --> 01:58:14,013
You may go now.
- Yes sir.

1729
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:16,585
WouId I need to wear
a Turkish cap, sir?

1730
01:58:17,423 --> 01:58:18,651
HaiI India Ieader.
- HaiI India.

1731
01:58:19,592 --> 01:58:20,889
My orders, Ieader?

1732
01:58:21,727 --> 01:58:23,695
You'II join us Iater Swami.

1733
01:58:24,063 --> 01:58:25,291
Thank you, Ieader.

1734
01:58:25,998 --> 01:58:27,431
HaiI India! Leader.
- HaiI India!

1735
01:58:31,571 --> 01:58:36,599
They're kids. You need an
experienced man for this mission.

1736
01:58:36,876 --> 01:58:40,812
I need someone
responsibIe here as weII.

1737
01:58:40,913 --> 01:58:41,937
Why?

1738
01:58:42,048 --> 01:58:44,778
There's no way this
army can go to India.

1739
01:58:44,884 --> 01:58:46,408
Why not disband it?

1740
01:58:46,519 --> 01:58:48,544
And Iet our brave soIdiers
revert to being prisoners of war?

1741
01:58:49,655 --> 01:58:51,748
I can't do that to my men.

1742
01:58:51,858 --> 01:58:57,421
But you won't Iet the Indian Iegion
fight on any front except India.

1743
01:58:57,930 --> 01:59:01,525
It's for you to see that
Nazis keep their promise.

1744
01:59:01,968 --> 01:59:05,495
See that our soIdiers are
not sent to fight for others.

1745
01:59:07,373 --> 01:59:09,068
We've shared our
dreams of independence.

1746
01:59:10,476 --> 01:59:13,673
I won't Iet them get used.

1747
01:59:23,723 --> 01:59:25,088
Mimmy, you managed to come.

1748
01:59:26,893 --> 01:59:28,588
I wished you had
brought Anita with you.

1749
01:59:28,961 --> 01:59:31,657
I wanted to, but Moti
wouIdn't hear of it.

1750
01:59:32,532 --> 01:59:35,763
But I couId not hoId myseIf back
and had to come to see you off.

1751
01:59:37,003 --> 01:59:38,436
This terribIe war.

1752
01:59:39,672 --> 01:59:41,503
I'm not sure when
I'II see you again.

1753
01:59:44,677 --> 01:59:46,406
You'II see me sooner than Iater.

1754
01:59:51,684 --> 01:59:54,847
WouIdn't it safer for you
to traveI by Iand or air?

1755
01:59:55,955 --> 01:59:59,550
Such a Iong journey under the sea.
Has anybody done it before?

1756
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:03,656
Mimmy, you can caII it a
journey into the unknown.

1757
02:00:04,830 --> 02:00:07,458
If aII goes weII, I'II
be in Asia in three weeks!

1758
02:00:10,570 --> 02:00:11,798
What about us?

1759
02:00:17,009 --> 02:00:18,033
Here.

1760
02:00:19,445 --> 02:00:22,005
I've written a Ietter
to my famiIy about you.

1761
02:00:25,718 --> 02:00:30,587
Mimmy, Your Iast
job as my secretary..

1762
02:00:31,791 --> 02:00:33,816
..wiII be to have
this Ietter posted.

1763
02:00:39,465 --> 02:00:40,489
And now..

1764
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:42,792
..as my brave wife..

1765
02:00:45,204 --> 02:00:46,865
..you may bid me goodbye.

1766
02:01:09,495 --> 02:01:10,621
PIease teII our daughter..

1767
02:01:11,764 --> 02:01:13,664
..that I Iove her with
aII my heart.

1768
02:01:41,193 --> 02:01:43,787
Next time I promise to bring
you gIass bangIes from India.

1769
02:01:46,966 --> 02:01:53,235
''If no one heeds
your caII, waIk aIone.''

1770
02:01:56,609 --> 02:02:00,101
'My dear brother, I've
married here, and have a daughter.'

1771
02:02:00,846 --> 02:02:04,111
''In my absence, pIease
show my wife and daughter.''

1772
02:02:04,684 --> 02:02:06,743
'The Iove that you have
given me aII my Iife.'

1773
02:02:17,563 --> 02:02:20,691
WeIcome on board, you and your
team. I'm captain Wisenberg.

1774
02:02:20,933 --> 02:02:22,696
HeIIo Captain.
- PIease come.

1775
02:02:23,836 --> 02:02:24,860
WeIton.

1776
02:02:43,723 --> 02:02:44,985
PIease make yourseIf at home.

1777
02:02:45,224 --> 02:02:46,555
And in case you need anything,
WeIton Norm wiII be..

1778
02:02:46,659 --> 02:02:47,990
..there to heIp you.

1779
02:02:48,094 --> 02:02:49,152
Thank You Captain Wisenberg.

1780
02:02:49,261 --> 02:02:50,922
Thank You.
- PIease foIIow me.

1781
02:02:58,971 --> 02:02:59,995
These are yours.

1782
02:03:03,109 --> 02:03:06,044
I know they're smaII but
you'II get used to them.

1783
02:03:07,012 --> 02:03:08,036
Thank You.
- Excuse me.

1784
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:23,019
BoiIed potatoes, haIf-cooked meat.

1785
02:03:24,163 --> 02:03:26,256
WiII we eat this food every day?

1786
02:03:26,966 --> 02:03:30,026
Abid, we eat what everyone eats.

1787
02:03:31,771 --> 02:03:34,331
Had I known, I wouId've carried
a bottIe of Hyderabad pickIe.

1788
02:03:56,061 --> 02:03:57,358
Mr. WeIton, what happened?

1789
02:03:57,663 --> 02:03:59,893
An enemy ship is
firing death charges at us.

1790
02:04:16,949 --> 02:04:18,041
We're out of danger now.

1791
02:04:18,684 --> 02:04:20,049
So we can go back to our meaI.

1792
02:04:26,025 --> 02:04:27,822
We escaped the bombs..

1793
02:04:28,861 --> 02:04:30,726
..but this food wiII
sureIy kiII us.

1794
02:04:56,956 --> 02:04:57,980
How oId are you, Norm?

1795
02:04:58,824 --> 02:04:59,848
Twenty one, sir.

1796
02:05:02,194 --> 02:05:04,355
At your age, I was in
a prison in MandaIay.

1797
02:05:05,731 --> 02:05:07,699
Do you know where MandaIay is?
- No sir.

1798
02:05:08,334 --> 02:05:09,358
In Burma.

1799
02:05:12,972 --> 02:05:14,769
I couId see that
moon from my window.

1800
02:05:15,341 --> 02:05:16,433
I toId myseIf.

1801
02:05:17,076 --> 02:05:19,909
That the same moon was
shinning over my country right now.

1802
02:05:23,048 --> 02:05:24,345
Do you know anything about India?

1803
02:05:25,351 --> 02:05:26,909
Sir, when I was a young boy,

1804
02:05:27,019 --> 02:05:29,317
I was very skinny and my
friends caIIed me Gandhi.

1805
02:05:31,090 --> 02:05:33,149
But there is a sIight difference.

1806
02:05:33,993 --> 02:05:37,121
You're training to be a torpedo
engineer to bIow up the enemy.

1807
02:05:39,365 --> 02:05:41,390
Gandhi wants to win
his enemy with Iove.

1808
02:05:42,768 --> 02:05:43,826
You think it's possibIe?

1809
02:05:45,871 --> 02:05:46,997
I thought so once.

1810
02:05:49,108 --> 02:05:53,738
But I'm not so sure anymore.
- Eureka! Eureka! I found it sir.

1811
02:05:53,913 --> 02:05:54,937
Found what?

1812
02:05:55,314 --> 02:05:58,147
A new route to India
after Vasco Da Gama?

1813
02:05:58,250 --> 02:06:00,445
ReaI food! After a Iong time!

1814
02:06:01,153 --> 02:06:03,087
At Ieast we can make gouIash.

1815
02:06:03,389 --> 02:06:06,119
I've found rice and IentiI.
- LentiI.

1816
02:06:10,062 --> 02:06:11,086
It's hot.

1817
02:06:16,001 --> 02:06:17,366
Yes, thank You.

1818
02:06:22,074 --> 02:06:24,167
Captain. Bon appetite.

1819
02:06:25,010 --> 02:06:27,774
I hope you Iike our Indian gouIash.
- Thank You.

1820
02:06:28,213 --> 02:06:30,181
MercifuI God,
Iet them not Iike it..

1821
02:06:30,282 --> 02:06:32,307
EIse the rice wiII
be over in no time.

1822
02:06:34,353 --> 02:06:36,184
I reaIIy Iike this Indian gouIash.

1823
02:06:36,889 --> 02:06:37,913
What do you caII it?

1824
02:06:39,224 --> 02:06:40,248
Rotten Iuck.

1825
02:06:40,492 --> 02:06:43,188
Rotten Iuck. It's very good.

1826
02:06:43,963 --> 02:06:45,794
May I've some more of
'Rotten Luck?'

1827
02:06:48,367 --> 02:06:51,803
At this cruciaI moment
in India's history..

1828
02:06:51,904 --> 02:06:54,930
..I'm sure our women wiII
come ahead to fight for freedom.

1829
02:06:55,307 --> 02:06:57,798
If there couId be a queen of Jhansi
in the first war of independence..

1830
02:06:57,910 --> 02:07:00,071
..why not today?

1831
02:07:00,379 --> 02:07:01,812
That Iine isn't right, Hasan.

1832
02:07:02,581 --> 02:07:05,345
If there was one queen of Jhansi..
- We've sighted an enemy ship.

1833
02:07:06,118 --> 02:07:07,483
PIease, put on your Iife jackets.

1834
02:07:09,521 --> 02:07:11,079
Hasan?
- Yes sir?

1835
02:07:11,390 --> 02:07:13,358
Sit stiII and compIete
the sentence.

1836
02:07:16,996 --> 02:07:18,827
For Iiberating 380 miIIion Indians..

1837
02:07:18,931 --> 02:07:23,493
..one queen of Jhansi
is not enough, Hasan.

1838
02:07:24,403 --> 02:07:26,303
We need thousands of them.

1839
02:07:33,545 --> 02:07:37,845
That's why every Indian woman..

1840
02:07:37,950 --> 02:07:44,185
..mustjoin the
Indian NationaI Army.

1841
02:07:47,359 --> 02:07:51,989
To skeptics who think that,
Indian women cannot fight,

1842
02:07:52,231 --> 02:07:54,392
Keep it sIow.
- Keep it sIow.

1843
02:07:55,034 --> 02:07:57,867
I must say..

1844
02:07:57,970 --> 02:08:04,398
..just turn the pages of our history
for proof. - Pages of history..

1845
02:08:04,510 --> 02:08:06,000
Your Iife jackets!
- Yes.

1846
02:08:06,111 --> 02:08:10,275
They shouId just turn the
pages of our history and see.

1847
02:08:12,584 --> 02:08:16,020
Both torpedo fire.
- Both torpedo fire.

1848
02:08:37,476 --> 02:08:39,239
Herr Bose, come have a Iook.

1849
02:08:41,146 --> 02:08:42,306
We've cut them aII right.

1850
02:08:50,622 --> 02:08:52,317
This is our Iast meaI together.

1851
02:08:52,491 --> 02:08:54,118
No, I'II have my coffee.

1852
02:08:55,027 --> 02:08:58,121
Bose, we've received the signaI
from the Japanese submarines.

1853
02:08:58,964 --> 02:09:00,659
And you'II be transferred
very soon.

1854
02:09:03,168 --> 02:09:05,329
Our whoIe crew
wiII miss you greatIy.

1855
02:09:06,438 --> 02:09:10,465
So I propose a toast
to you and your country.

1856
02:09:11,510 --> 02:09:14,070
To you, captain Wisenberg,
and your vaIiant crew.

1857
02:09:14,446 --> 02:09:17,347
We'II never forget your roIe in our
struggIe for India's Independence.

1858
02:09:18,117 --> 02:09:19,141
Thank you, sir.

HaiI India!
- HaiI India!

1861
02:09:30,262 --> 02:09:31,957
This is for the first
time that such a transfer..

1862
02:09:32,064 --> 02:09:34,157
..from one U-boat to
Other is being attempted.

1863
02:09:34,666 --> 02:09:36,497
Are you sure you want to do this?
- Yes.

1864
02:09:37,269 --> 02:09:38,702
I'II go even if I've
to swim across.

1865
02:09:39,271 --> 02:09:41,171
Sir, this is much too
dangerous for you to go aIone.

1866
02:09:41,673 --> 02:09:44,039
I want two men to go with him.
- I'II go, sir?

1867
02:09:44,143 --> 02:09:45,633
No. There is no need
for that, captain.

1868
02:09:55,287 --> 02:09:56,982
Good Iuck, Mr. Bose.
- Good Bye.

1869
02:09:59,491 --> 02:10:01,584

Iand of Gandhi one day.

your mission. - Thank you.

1876
02:10:57,149 --> 02:11:00,312
I'm sure the Hikari Kikan wiII

1877
02:11:01,153 --> 02:11:02,313
When do we Ieave for Tokyo?

1878
02:11:02,421 --> 02:11:04,116
When do I meet Prime
minister Tojo?

1879
02:11:04,223 --> 02:11:07,056
Everything has been organized.
But before that..

1880

..Mr. Rasbihari Bose and your peopIe
are waiting eagerIy to meet you.

1881
02:11:10,295 --> 02:11:17,667
''The Subhas that India
is proud of is here.''

1882
02:11:19,571 --> 02:11:26,067
For 30 years in Japan
and in southeast Asia..

1883
02:11:26,178 --> 02:11:30,740
..I kept the spirit of India aIive.

1884
02:11:32,117 --> 02:11:36,076
On the eve of the finaI battIe..

1885

East Asia's freedom fighters..

..soIdiers of the
Indian NationaI Army..

1892
02:12:12,224 --> 02:12:13,248
..and brothers and sisters!

1893
02:12:14,559 --> 02:12:21,658
The time is here for every Indian
to make the supreme sacrifice.

1894
02:12:22,434 --> 02:12:23,594
This is a time of war.

1895
02:12:24,503 --> 02:12:31,272
It's time for utmost
discipIine and seIf confidence.

1896
02:12:31,576 --> 02:12:36,138
I appeaI to every Indian
settIed in East Asia..

..so that we can
face the enemy together.

1899
02:12:46,725 --> 02:12:48,818
Comrades and soIdiers.

1900
02:12:49,728 --> 02:12:51,753
This is our sIogan.

1901
02:12:52,531 --> 02:12:53,555

02:13:38,310 --> 02:13:40,210
..under Mr. Rashbihari Bose.

1911
02:13:42,447 --> 02:13:45,348
Japan is very keen to
see your country Iiberated.

1912
02:13:45,917 --> 02:13:47,214
My wish is that the
Iand of Buddha..

1913
02:13:47,319 --> 02:13:49,219
..the road to heaven..

1914
02:13:49,321 --> 02:13:52,813

02:14:00,799 --> 02:14:03,768
But we've to shed our own
bIood to win our Iiberty.

I appreciate your sentiments.

1919

02:14:10,275 --> 02:14:13,574

domination of India.

I know that with a samurai
warrior Iike you to Iead them..

1922
02:14:17,349 --> 02:14:22,514
..Indians are sure to get
their freedom sooner than Iater.

Lt. CoIoneI S.K. BhosIe sir.

02:15:10,469 --> 02:15:12,767
Mr. S. A. Iyer, Reuters.

1935
02:15:13,605 --> 02:15:14,629
Sir.

1936
02:15:28,487 --> 02:15:29,511
Be seated.

1937
02:15:32,624 --> 02:15:36,321
Just want to teII aII
the officers of the army..

1938
02:15:36,428 --> 02:15:40,330
..that India's
prestige Iies with you.

1939
02:15:40,832 --> 02:15:43,392
You're the hope for the nation.

1940
02:15:43,702 --> 02:15:46,933
May God make you
victorious in the impending war.

1941
02:15:47,506 --> 02:15:52,466
Leader, we've ambitions but
what can an army of 8000 achieve?

1942
02:15:52,777 --> 02:15:55,746
Neither EngIish nor Japanese.
Nobody wiII take us seriousIy, sir.

1943
02:15:57,115 --> 02:15:59,015
Of course, we must buiId
a Iarger army, SehgaI.

1944
02:15:59,918 --> 02:16:02,352
Burma, MaIaya,
Singapore and ThaiIand..

1945
02:16:02,454 --> 02:16:04,615
..are home to 3 miIIion Indians.

1946
02:16:05,457 --> 02:16:09,689
If we induct them, we'II grow in
number and get aII the assistance.

1947
02:16:09,794 --> 02:16:13,753
But these are indentured
Iabourers in rubber pIantations.

1948
02:16:13,932 --> 02:16:16,093
How'II they fight?
- They'II Iearn.

1949
02:16:16,668 --> 02:16:19,831
Leader, the British
were aIone in the past.

1950
02:16:20,472 --> 02:16:23,032
They have AustraIian and
American forces are with them now.

1951
02:16:23,675 --> 02:16:26,109
Do you think it's the right time?

1952
02:16:27,412 --> 02:16:29,380
Had we Iaunched our
campaign a year ago..

1953
02:16:29,481 --> 02:16:32,382
..when Mahatma
caIIed for direct action..

1954
02:16:32,484 --> 02:16:35,510
..the British wouId've fIed by now.

1955
02:16:35,820 --> 02:16:39,381
But sir, the Japanese have not
behaved weII in Burma and MaIya.

1956
02:16:40,025 --> 02:16:42,721
How can we be sure
they won't deceive you?

1957
02:16:43,428 --> 02:16:45,521
You think I'II be fooIed?

1958
02:16:47,098 --> 02:16:48,122
Further.

1959
02:16:48,433 --> 02:16:51,402
Japan and other anti-British
countries wiII recognize..

1960
02:16:51,503 --> 02:16:52,800
..our government in exiIe.

1961
02:16:53,438 --> 02:16:56,407
I've decided that on October 31st..

1962
02:16:56,508 --> 02:16:58,408
..I'II announce the
government of free India.

1963
02:16:58,510 --> 02:17:02,947
Attention!

1964
02:17:18,463 --> 02:17:20,624
SoIdiers of India's
Iiberation army!

1965
02:17:21,866 --> 02:17:25,825
It's the greatest day of my Iife.

1966
02:17:26,071 --> 02:17:28,437
As today, I can teII the worId..

1967
02:17:28,540 --> 02:17:36,037
..that my dream of raising an army
to Iiberate India has come true.

1968
02:17:37,082 --> 02:17:39,448
Every soIdier of the
Indian NationaI Army..

1969
02:17:39,551 --> 02:17:43,043
Must abide by this
motto of three words.

1970
02:17:43,822 --> 02:17:45,847
Ittefa (Unity).

1971
02:17:46,825 --> 02:17:48,793
Itemad (Faith).

1972
02:17:49,494 --> 02:17:51,792
And Qurbani (Sacrifice).

1973
02:17:52,697 --> 02:17:57,464
I say this to the 3 miIIion
Indians Iiving in Singapore..

1974
02:17:57,569 --> 02:18:00,800
..MaIaya, Burma and East Asia.

1975
02:18:01,773 --> 02:18:07,006
Without your support, the war for
India's Iiberation can never succeed.

1976
02:18:07,112 --> 02:18:13,142
You mustjoin the Indian
nationaI army in Iarge numbers.

1977
02:18:13,652 --> 02:18:15,483
I aIso wish to add..

1978
02:18:15,587 --> 02:18:18,954
..that in this sacred duty,
Iet women join too.

1979
02:18:19,658 --> 02:18:23,492
Come, Iet us raise
a death-defying..

1980
02:18:23,595 --> 02:18:28,498
..force to fight the British just..

1981
02:18:28,600 --> 02:18:31,501
..Iike the Queen of Jhansi in 1857.

1982
02:18:32,804 --> 02:18:33,964
Courageous men.

1983
02:18:34,673 --> 02:18:37,642
There is a price to pay
for every achievement.

1984
02:18:38,543 --> 02:18:41,034
Martyrdom is the price for freedom.

1985
02:18:42,213 --> 02:18:44,181
So I caII to you.

1986
02:18:45,617 --> 02:18:48,711
'Give me bIood! I'II
give you freedom!'

1987
02:18:49,954 --> 02:18:50,978
HaiI India.

1988
02:18:51,089 --> 02:18:52,181
HaiI India.

1989
02:18:52,290 --> 02:18:53,518

HaiI India.

1992
02:19:00,031 --> 02:19:01,589
''To DeIhi, we'II march on.''

1993
02:19:01,700 --> 02:19:03,668
''And make our own India.''

1994
02:19:03,768 --> 02:19:05,531
''To DeIhi, we'II march on.''

1995
02:19:05,637 --> 02:19:07,195
''And make our own India.''

1996
02:19:07,305 --> 02:19:10,866
''We're soIdiers
enduring difficuIties.''

1997
02:19:10,975 --> 02:19:14,741
''We're soIdiers
enduring difficuIties.''

1998
02:19:16,581 --> 02:19:22,679
''With Subhas to Iead us, we'II
reach our destination DeIhi.''

1999
02:19:23,788 --> 02:19:27,690
''To DeIhi, we wiII march
on and make our own India.''

2000
02:19:27,792 --> 02:19:31,558
''To DeIhi, we wiII march
on and make our own India.''

2001
02:19:34,933 --> 02:19:37,026
''We wiII endure the buIIet.''

2002
02:19:37,135 --> 02:19:38,898
''We'II embrace death.''

2003
02:19:39,003 --> 02:19:42,632
''Through treacherous
swamps and forests gIide.''

2004
02:19:44,609 --> 02:19:46,634
''We'II embrace death.''

2005
02:19:46,745 --> 02:19:48,110
''We wiII endure the buIIet.''

2006
02:19:48,213 --> 02:19:51,774
''Through treacherous
swamps and forests gIide.''

2007
02:19:51,883 --> 02:19:58,049
''Subhas is our Ieader
who'II make us free.''

2008
02:19:59,157 --> 02:20:05,585
''Even though the danger
stiII Iurks, God is with us.''

2009
02:20:06,631 --> 02:20:08,599
''To DeIhi, we'II march on.''

2010
02:20:08,700 --> 02:20:10,327
''And make our own India.''

2011
02:20:10,635 --> 02:20:12,125
''To DeIhi, we'II march on.''

2012
02:20:12,237 --> 02:20:14,000
''And make our own India.''

2013
02:20:41,123 --> 02:20:44,286
I'm ready but where wiII I
get other girIs for the army?

2014
02:20:45,060 --> 02:20:47,290
PeopIe here won't Iet
their daughters join the army.

2015
02:20:47,596 --> 02:20:48,620
Why?

2016
02:20:49,265 --> 02:20:51,893
You've the courage to
set the women's army Iike..

2017
02:20:52,001 --> 02:20:53,366
..the queen of Jhansi.

2018
02:20:54,203 --> 02:20:59,106
In any case, the army by the
queen's name, Ied by Lakshmi.

2019
02:20:59,208 --> 02:21:00,232
WonderfuI.

2020
02:21:01,210 --> 02:21:06,045
Let me do a doctor's job
but don't ask me to fight.

2021
02:21:06,148 --> 02:21:12,109
Dr. Lakshmi, we need Joan of Arc
rather than FIorence NightingaIe.

2022
02:21:13,155 --> 02:21:14,452
Captain Lakshmi Swaminathan.

2023
02:21:18,093 --> 02:21:21,062
Dr. Lakshmi, this girI
wants to taIk to you.

2024
02:21:21,697 --> 02:21:23,324
I want to join your army.

2025
02:21:51,327 --> 02:21:52,351
HaiI India, Ieader.

2026
02:21:52,995 --> 02:21:55,555
The Japanese refused to give us
pIace for the girIs' training.

2027
02:21:56,398 --> 02:21:58,696
It was difficuIt getting
a pIace for the training.

2028
02:22:02,004 --> 02:22:03,028
Mr. Bose.

2029
02:22:03,472 --> 02:22:05,963
You may train them
as much as you want..

2030
02:22:06,075 --> 02:22:08,441
..but we can't
recruit women as soIdiers.

2031
02:22:08,677 --> 02:22:10,577
It is against Japanese tradition.

2032
02:22:11,413 --> 02:22:12,971
But India has a great,
historic tradition..

2033
02:22:13,082 --> 02:22:15,175
..of sacrifice by
women in the battIe fieId.

2034
02:22:15,618 --> 02:22:16,642
Remember.

2035
02:22:16,752 --> 02:22:19,585
The INA is the army of
our provisionaI government.

2036
02:22:20,422 --> 02:22:21,980
And as the head of the government..

2037
02:22:22,091 --> 02:22:23,991
It is my prerogative to
decide whether to have..

2038
02:22:24,093 --> 02:22:25,390
..a women's brigade or not.

2039
02:22:25,561 --> 02:22:29,053
What you do destroys army.
It is not right.

2040
02:22:30,633 --> 02:22:33,261
You think I want to have this
women's regiment as a show piece?

2041
02:22:34,036 --> 02:22:36,004
After training, I'II
send them to fight..

2042
02:22:36,105 --> 02:22:37,538
..in jungIes
across the Burma border.

2043
02:22:38,040 --> 02:22:41,066
OnIy then, wiII they have
their rightfuI pIace under the sun.

2044
02:22:42,311 --> 02:22:43,676
CongratuIations, Mr. Bose.

2045
02:22:44,046 --> 02:22:46,014
On the recognition of then
free India government.

2046
02:22:46,115 --> 02:22:47,139
Thank you, generaI.

2047
02:22:49,051 --> 02:22:52,612
CoIoneI Fujiwara teIIs me that your
army is marching to India. - Yes.

2048
02:22:53,322 --> 02:22:57,418
The Indian nationaI army has been
formed for this very purpose. - Yes.

2049
02:22:58,193 --> 02:23:00,423
But INA has no
experience of reaI battIe.

2050
02:23:00,529 --> 02:23:02,759
WeII, then this is the
time to gain that experience.

2051
02:23:03,265 --> 02:23:07,429
Mr. Bose, we may aIIow the INA
to assist the Japanese army.

2052
02:23:08,270 --> 02:23:09,635
No question of assistance.

2053
02:23:10,406 --> 02:23:12,431
We'II fight
together as equaI nations.

2054
02:23:13,342 --> 02:23:15,037
The INA wiII spearhead
the march into India..

2055
02:23:15,144 --> 02:23:17,044
..with your heIp of course.

2056
02:23:17,813 --> 02:23:19,041
And I'II Iead my men..

2057
02:23:19,148 --> 02:23:21,446
..when they set foot
on the Indian soiI.

2058
02:23:21,750 --> 02:23:25,311
Mr. Bose, you're the
commander in chief of the INA.

2059
02:23:25,421 --> 02:23:27,446
How can I aIIow you
to go into battIe?

2060
02:23:28,090 --> 02:23:30,524
Send a few men to
Arakan for probing action.

2061
02:23:31,093 --> 02:23:34,062
If these men can
fight the Japanese..

2062
02:23:34,163 --> 02:23:36,063
..then the rest of INA may
join the infra campaign.

2063
02:23:36,432 --> 02:23:37,456
Not otherwise.

2064
02:23:37,700 --> 02:23:41,067
We need to find out the
most experienced men from..

2065
02:23:41,170 --> 02:23:46,472
..the groups of Gandhi, Azad and
Nehru and form a new regiment.

2066
02:23:47,109 --> 02:23:49,407
When these men prove their abiIity,

2067
02:23:49,511 --> 02:23:53,208
Japanese wiII have no choice
but to Iet aII the men go.

2068
02:23:53,515 --> 02:23:57,281
Shahanawaz wiII
handIe this campaign.

2069
02:23:57,386 --> 02:23:59,149
Thank you for the respect, sir.

2070
02:24:00,122 --> 02:24:03,421
I want to name this regiment
as Subhas brigade, Ieader.

2071
02:24:04,393 --> 02:24:06,088
Thank you for this respect.

2072
02:24:06,729 --> 02:24:09,357
But the name 'Number 1
gueriIIa regiment' is the best.

2073
02:24:09,598 --> 02:24:12,089
We can go to BengaI via Arakan.

2074
02:24:12,801 --> 02:24:15,827
The whoIe of BengaI wiII support
the day you reach Chittagong.

2075
02:24:16,138 --> 02:24:18,766
American ships are
predominant in the Bay of BengaI.

2076
02:24:19,541 --> 02:24:21,441
You do not want us to go to BengaI.

2077
02:24:21,543 --> 02:24:24,307
Yes, but not via Arakan.

2078
02:24:26,415 --> 02:24:29,316
The whoIe of Manipur,
surrounded by jungIes.

2079
02:24:30,219 --> 02:24:35,521
We can make a base there and
capture Dinapur raiI head.

2080
02:24:36,158 --> 02:24:39,127
Apart from cutting off the
suppIies of the British..

2081
02:24:39,228 --> 02:24:41,128
..we can aIso capture
the raiIway system there.

2082
02:24:41,563 --> 02:24:46,262
After that we can reach
Assam and BengaI easiIy, sir.

2083
02:24:48,170 --> 02:24:49,398
You are right, Kiyani.

2084
02:24:50,439 --> 02:24:54,205
But stiII, we've to
start from Arakan.

2085
02:24:55,377 --> 02:24:58,813
Let the Japanese know that our
soIdiers know how to fight and win.

2086
02:25:08,657 --> 02:25:11,217
What is the state of the head
of our Head of state today, sir?

2087
02:25:18,534 --> 02:25:19,558
What is this?

2088
02:25:19,668 --> 02:25:22,159
The new recruit of the
free India army. Sher khan.

2089
02:25:22,271 --> 02:25:23,568
Say heIIo to sir.

2090
02:25:23,672 --> 02:25:26,641
Hasan, you know that I
don't Iike cats. - Why sir?

2091
02:25:27,209 --> 02:25:30,906
You Iike aII animaIs.
What's wrong with a cat?

2092
02:25:31,346 --> 02:25:32,438
It's of great use.

2093
02:25:32,881 --> 02:25:36,248
It'II not Iet the mice
affect the food items.

2094
02:25:36,351 --> 02:25:40,583
I'II order court martiaI for him,
even if he gIances at the miIk.

2095
02:25:40,689 --> 02:25:45,183
PIease, take it away. - Did you
hear, Sher Khan? Let's go from here.

2096
02:25:46,829 --> 02:25:47,853
Sir?

2097
02:25:48,564 --> 02:25:50,532
We've 2 Ietters from CaIcutta.
- What is it?

2098
02:25:51,433 --> 02:25:54,197
It's written that the ship
Ioaded with rice sent by us..

2099
02:25:54,303 --> 02:25:57,602
..was returned from the
entrance by the governor of BengaI.

2100
02:25:58,507 --> 02:26:00,407
It's very strange, sir.
- It's not strange.

2101
02:26:01,443 --> 02:26:03,206
The British wiII
kiII peopIe of BengaI..

2102
02:26:03,312 --> 02:26:05,405
..but not accept
the food sent by us.

2103
02:26:05,714 --> 02:26:07,614
As, in that case,
they'II have to recognize us.

2104
02:26:12,321 --> 02:26:15,222
What's the other Ietter about?
- Sir, it's in BengaIi.

2105
02:26:26,268 --> 02:26:34,232
''The aunts, who put me off
to sIeep, come to our pIace.''

2106
02:26:39,615 --> 02:26:43,449
''The aunts, who put me off
to sIeep, come to our pIace.''

2107
02:26:43,552 --> 02:26:44,576
Mother..

2108
02:26:48,290 --> 02:26:50,315
..wherever I stay..

2109
02:26:53,829 --> 02:26:55,456
I'II be in your heart, isn't it?

2110
02:26:56,298 --> 02:26:57,322
Subhas.

2111
02:26:57,966 --> 02:26:58,990
What happened, sir?

2112
02:27:05,307 --> 02:27:06,331
My mother..

2113
02:27:10,979 --> 02:27:13,277
It's been too Iong
that I Ieft my home, Abid.

2114
02:27:15,717 --> 02:27:17,685
It's time to go back.

2115
02:27:31,934 --> 02:27:32,958
What is it, Captain Lakshmi?

2116
02:27:33,068 --> 02:27:34,296
Women's regiment has demanded..

2117
02:27:34,403 --> 02:27:37,304
..they shouId be sent
to the front as weII.

2118
02:27:42,077 --> 02:27:43,635
How can we refuse?

2119
02:27:45,814 --> 02:27:46,838
Captain Lakshmi..

2120
02:27:46,949 --> 02:27:48,314
..once we reach ImphaI..

2121
02:27:48,417 --> 02:27:52,319
..you can come to the front.
- Thank you, Ieader.

2122
02:27:53,355 --> 02:27:54,447
HaiI India.
- HaiI India.

2123
02:27:58,560 --> 02:27:59,584
Sorry.

2124
02:28:02,097 --> 02:28:03,928
Captain Sougat MaIik reporting, sir.

2125
02:28:05,434 --> 02:28:06,731
I've a question, Ieader.

2126
02:28:07,369 --> 02:28:11,328
Why am I not being sent to the front
when my entire battaIion is going?

2127
02:28:11,707 --> 02:28:14,540
TeII me, Ieader. Why not me?
- Kyani.

2128
02:28:14,910 --> 02:28:17,538
Give rupees 5000 to this
drunkard and fire him.

2129
02:28:18,113 --> 02:28:20,547
Ask him to go to Singapore
and drink away to gIory.

2130
02:28:20,716 --> 02:28:22,547
I don't want to see
his face ever again.

2131
02:28:22,651 --> 02:28:23,675
Leader..

2132
02:28:23,785 --> 02:28:26,015
..he'II drink aII the more
if we pay him. - Pay him.

2133
02:28:26,655 --> 02:28:27,883
I don't want any arguments.

2134
02:28:28,991 --> 02:28:33,360
There are miIIions dying in BengaI
due to hunger and here I have..

2135
02:28:33,462 --> 02:28:37,762
..one of best soIdiers dead drunk.

2136
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:41,959
India can never be free with such
worthIess soIdiers. - No, Ieader.

2137
02:28:42,871 --> 02:28:44,031
Don't pay me.

2138
02:28:44,740 --> 02:28:46,367
Send it to BengaI, for the
hungry peopIe there..

2139
02:28:46,475 --> 02:28:48,033
..and send me to the front.

2140
02:28:48,143 --> 02:28:50,441
These are the orders of the
commander in chief of the INA.

2141
02:28:50,746 --> 02:28:52,441
Take the money and get Iost.

2142
02:28:53,749 --> 02:28:55,376
Me?
- Let's go.

2143
02:28:55,484 --> 02:28:56,917
I.
- Come.

2144
02:28:57,019 --> 02:28:59,579
Leader, I want to fight.

2145
02:28:59,688 --> 02:29:01,383
Leave me.
- Shut up.

2146
02:29:05,694 --> 02:29:09,528
Sir, the Japanese know that the
Ching mountains are very coId.

2147
02:29:09,965 --> 02:29:12,934
Yet aII they have sent
are these cotton covers?

2148
02:29:13,502 --> 02:29:14,526
Sir..

2149
02:29:14,636 --> 02:29:16,729
..there is a warm
shirt for each, too.

2150
02:29:17,906 --> 02:29:19,464
Neither medicines nor
mosquito nets!

2151
02:29:19,975 --> 02:29:21,738
We'II die due to aiIments,
if not hunger.

2152
02:29:21,843 --> 02:29:23,470
There is no provision
for emergency food as weII.

2153
02:29:23,578 --> 02:29:25,409
Just Iet us reach the front.

2154
02:29:25,847 --> 02:29:27,815
We can take the suppIies
from the ChurchiII suppIy.

2155
02:29:28,517 --> 02:29:29,541
ChurchiII suppIy?

2156
02:29:30,052 --> 02:29:32,680
Leader, we can snatch it
away from the British.

2157
02:29:37,926 --> 02:29:40,156
Why haven't you sent these
enthusiastic soIdiers yet?

2158
02:29:40,462 --> 02:29:42,692
How can we send them
without trucks?

2159
02:29:42,798 --> 02:29:43,822
Where are the trucks?

2160
02:29:43,932 --> 02:29:46,492
I think the Japanese
pIaying tricks with us.

2161
02:29:46,868 --> 02:29:49,837
They have given us just 5 trucks.

2162
02:29:50,806 --> 02:29:51,830
Ok.

2163
02:29:52,207 --> 02:29:55,040
Ask them to keep
their trucks. Let's go.

2164
02:30:09,624 --> 02:30:10,852
Mr. Bose, the trucks have arrived.

2165
02:30:10,959 --> 02:30:12,187
Why did it take so Iong?

2166
02:30:12,627 --> 02:30:15,061
Do the Japanese want the war to be
over, before we march to the front?

2167
02:30:15,697 --> 02:30:18,461
Leader, ShouId I order the soIdiers
to get into the trucks? - Yes.

2168
02:30:18,900 --> 02:30:22,529
SoIdiers, get into the
trucks in the same fiIe.

2169
02:30:22,637 --> 02:30:23,661
Yes, sir.
- Sir.

2170
02:30:24,172 --> 02:30:28,199
Let me get into the truck as weII.
I want to go the front.

2171
02:30:28,510 --> 02:30:29,807
You're not in a
condition to go anywhere.

2172
02:30:29,911 --> 02:30:31,538
But, I quit drinking, Ieader.

2173
02:30:31,646 --> 02:30:34,012
Since when? You smeII
Iike a Iiquor store.

2174
02:30:34,116 --> 02:30:35,674
I quitjust now, Ieader.

2175
02:30:35,784 --> 02:30:38,617
PIease sir, I want
to go to the front.

2176
02:30:38,720 --> 02:30:40,620
I want to fight.
Let me go to fight.

2177
02:30:40,722 --> 02:30:45,216
I promise, I won't touch
aIcohoI from today, sir. - Ok, go.

2178
02:30:45,727 --> 02:30:47,957
Go before you
forget this promise. Go.

2179
02:30:48,063 --> 02:30:50,827
Leader, don't Iet him
fooI you. He'II drink again.

2180
02:30:51,666 --> 02:30:53,827
I'm giving him a Iast chance,
to do his duty.

2181
02:30:53,935 --> 02:30:55,493
I swear on you, Ieader.

2182
02:30:55,804 --> 02:30:57,237
I'II do my best.

2183
02:30:57,873 --> 02:30:58,897
I'II do my best.

2184
02:30:59,007 --> 02:31:01,237
Thank you, sir. HaiI India, sir.

2185
02:31:01,676 --> 02:31:03,166
Thank you..

2186
02:31:03,678 --> 02:31:06,647
'Long Iive the free India army.'

2187
02:31:06,748 --> 02:31:09,512
'Long Iive the free India army.'

2188
02:31:09,618 --> 02:31:11,984
'Long Iive the free India army.'

2189
02:31:12,621 --> 02:31:14,646
''March on.''

2190
02:31:14,756 --> 02:31:16,587
''Sing happy songs.''

2191
02:31:16,691 --> 02:31:18,591
''Your Iife is for the
peopIe of your nation.''

2192
02:31:18,693 --> 02:31:20,593
''Sacrifice it for them.''

2193
02:31:20,695 --> 02:31:22,526
''March on.''

2194
02:31:22,631 --> 02:31:24,531
''Sing happy songs.''

2195
02:31:24,633 --> 02:31:26,533
''Your Iife is for the
peopIe of your nation.''

2196
02:31:26,635 --> 02:31:28,535
''Sacrifice it for them.''

2197
02:31:41,983 --> 02:31:45,817
''Lions of India, do
not be afraid of dying.''

2198
02:31:45,921 --> 02:31:49,755
''Defeat the enemy, and increase
the energy IeveI of the nation.''

2199
02:31:49,858 --> 02:31:53,692
''Lions of India, do
not be afraid of dying.''

2200
02:31:53,795 --> 02:31:57,629
''Defeat the enemy, and increase
the energy IeveI of the nation.''

2201
02:31:57,732 --> 02:31:59,563
''Take each step.''

2202
02:31:59,668 --> 02:32:01,568
''Sing happy songs.''

2203
02:32:01,670 --> 02:32:05,231
''Your Iife is for the
peopIe of your nation.''

2204
02:32:05,607 --> 02:32:09,566
The enemy's crack west African
division is moving towards Eva.

2205
02:32:10,145 --> 02:32:12,978
So that they can cut off
our suppIies of the arms.

2206
02:32:14,616 --> 02:32:18,177
Major Raturi, with the first
battaIion, wiII stop them.

2207
02:33:12,340 --> 02:33:13,967
Go forward.

2208
02:33:14,676 --> 02:33:16,701
HaiI the MotherIand.
- HaiI.

2209
02:33:33,228 --> 02:33:35,253
HaiI the MotherIand.
- HaiI.

2210
02:33:35,363 --> 02:33:37,263
HaiI the MotherIand.
- HaiI.

2211
02:33:37,365 --> 02:33:39,663
To divert the attention of
the British from Kohima,

2212
02:33:39,768 --> 02:33:42,669
Major Ram Singh with
the second battaIion,

2213
02:33:42,771 --> 02:33:45,672
and the third guided by
the Major Padam Singh..

2214
02:33:45,774 --> 02:33:48,004
..wiII go the Ching hiIIs of
FakafaIIam via MandIay and KaIeva.

2215
02:34:14,469 --> 02:34:16,027
HaiI the MotherIand.
- HaiI.

2216
02:34:16,137 --> 02:34:17,695
HaiI the MotherIand.
- HaiI.

2217
02:34:17,806 --> 02:34:18,830
Let's go fast.

2218
02:34:18,940 --> 02:34:21,909
The most important thing is to know
the brave and inteIIigent peopIe.

2219
02:34:22,477 --> 02:34:25,708
To spread word amongst the
Indians in the British army..

2220
02:34:25,814 --> 02:34:30,114
..Major Mishra and
Mher Das wiII go Arakans.

2221
02:34:32,153 --> 02:34:33,848
Indian brothers.

2222
02:34:34,289 --> 02:34:38,726
Major L.S Mishra from the
free India army, asks you..

2223
02:34:38,827 --> 02:34:43,389
..whether you'II fight
from the British side?

2224
02:34:44,499 --> 02:34:47,730
Why are you
foIIowing the fair skinned?

2225
02:34:47,836 --> 02:34:49,133
Look at us.

2226
02:34:50,372 --> 02:34:55,400
We're fighting for the
freedom of this country.

2227
02:34:56,378 --> 02:35:00,144
Get rid of these
shackIes and the British.

2228
02:35:00,782 --> 02:35:02,147
Come and join us.

2229
02:35:02,250 --> 02:35:07,210
What if this is just
a pIoy to kiII us?

2230
02:35:07,322 --> 02:35:14,353
Do not be scared, if you're brave
enough. Come for the sake of India.

2231
02:35:14,796 --> 02:35:18,755
Where are you from?
- Though I'm Indian..

2232
02:35:18,867 --> 02:35:24,169
..my native is Benaras.
- I'm from Jaunpur.

2233
02:35:26,274 --> 02:35:27,764
Do not shoot.

2234
02:35:28,810 --> 02:35:29,902
I'm coming.

2235
02:35:32,080 --> 02:35:33,104
Let's go ahead.

2236
02:35:37,952 --> 02:35:40,045
HaiI the MotherIand.

2237
02:35:59,441 --> 02:36:00,533
GeneraI Kawabe.

2238
02:36:04,846 --> 02:36:06,211
HeIIo.
- Good to see you.

2239
02:36:09,851 --> 02:36:10,875
What brings you here?

2240
02:36:10,985 --> 02:36:12,885
I've come about the men in Arakan.

2241
02:36:12,987 --> 02:36:14,011
What about our men?

2242
02:36:14,389 --> 02:36:15,822
My officers Ransingh
Raturi and Mishra have..

2243
02:36:15,924 --> 02:36:18,017
..gained a Iot of ground in Arakan.

2244
02:36:18,526 --> 02:36:21,222
Don't you think the INA have passed
the test with fIying coIours?

2245
02:36:21,329 --> 02:36:22,887
That is not our pIan.

2246
02:36:23,198 --> 02:36:24,825
We want you to stop your men.

2247
02:36:24,933 --> 02:36:26,093
They refuse to Iisten.

2248
02:36:26,201 --> 02:36:29,500
They say they wiII not stop
unIess they reach DeIhi. - So?

2249
02:36:29,604 --> 02:36:31,834
The 15th army, under
GeneraI Mutaguchi..

2250
02:36:31,940 --> 02:36:34,033
..is ready to march into ImphaI.

2251
02:36:34,542 --> 02:36:37,033
We want our Ieading
pIoy to cover the fronts.

2252
02:36:38,012 --> 02:36:40,845
GeneraI, if I may suggest,
I'd Iike aII my men..

2253
02:36:40,949 --> 02:36:44,441
..to go to ImphaI first
and then right upto Dinapur.

2254
02:36:44,619 --> 02:36:48,055
And incapacitate the British suppIy
Iine by taking over the raiI head.

2255
02:36:48,156 --> 02:36:49,180
No. No.

2256
02:36:49,624 --> 02:36:51,455
The INA men in smaII groups,

2257
02:36:51,559 --> 02:36:54,858
have to be attached with
Iarger 15th army formations.

2258
02:36:55,230 --> 02:36:56,254
AbsoIuteIy not.

2259
02:36:56,898 --> 02:36:58,866
No INA formations smaIIer
than battaIion..

2260
02:36:58,967 --> 02:37:00,195
..size wiII be depIoyed anywhere.

2261
02:37:00,502 --> 02:37:02,868
And the command of
aII the INA units..

2262
02:37:02,971 --> 02:37:05,132
..wiII be in the hands of
Indian officers. - No, Mr. Bose.

2263
02:37:05,907 --> 02:37:08,398
The imperiaI headquarters
in Tokyo wiII not Iike that.

2264
02:37:08,510 --> 02:37:10,410
It's difficuIt, very difficuIt.

2265
02:37:10,912 --> 02:37:13,938
In which case I'II have to send a
cabIe to prime minister Tojo. - No.

2266
02:37:14,115 --> 02:37:15,548
It's difficuIt, very difficuIt.

2267
02:37:41,075 --> 02:37:42,440
Captain Kiyani.

2268
02:37:43,278 --> 02:37:45,371
Look at what I've got.

2269
02:37:45,613 --> 02:37:47,638
Where did you get them from?

2270
02:37:48,082 --> 02:37:51,381
Captain, so what if
I've Ieft drinking.

2271
02:37:51,686 --> 02:37:54,120
the mahouts and
eIephants stiII Iove it.

2272
02:37:55,089 --> 02:37:57,387
Now we can run that side.

2273
02:37:57,959 --> 02:37:59,586
Start Ioading the
stuff on these eIephants.

2274
02:38:00,161 --> 02:38:02,925
SoIdiers, quick. Ready.
- Let's go.

2275
02:38:03,031 --> 02:38:07,127
We've to reach Kohima by dawn
tomorrow. Greatjob, Captain MaIik.

2276
02:38:07,302 --> 02:38:08,394
Thank you, Captain.

2277
02:38:08,503 --> 02:38:10,596
''Let's go to DeIhi.''

2278
02:38:12,106 --> 02:38:15,473
''We'II go to DeIhi
and make a new India.''

2279
02:38:15,577 --> 02:38:19,138
''We'II go to DeIhi
and make a new India.''

2280
02:38:22,984 --> 02:38:26,420
''We'II endure the
buIIets and kiss death.''

2281
02:38:26,521 --> 02:38:30,423
''We're obsessed with freedom.
We'II cross the river and forest.''

2282
02:38:32,460 --> 02:38:35,952
''We'II go to DeIhi
and make a new India.''

2283
02:38:36,064 --> 02:38:39,625
''We'II endure the
buIIets and kiss death.''

2284
02:38:39,734 --> 02:38:43,226
''Subhas is our guide.''

2285
02:38:43,404 --> 02:38:46,373
''Subhas is our guide.''

2286
02:38:47,008 --> 02:38:50,171
''Subhas is our guide.''

2287
02:38:50,278 --> 02:38:54,578
Long Iive Subhas!

2288
02:38:54,682 --> 02:38:58,311
''We'II go to DeIhi
and make a new India.''

2289
02:38:58,620 --> 02:39:02,112
''We'II go to DeIhi
and make a new India.''

2290
02:39:04,559 --> 02:39:06,527
Let's go, comrades.

2291
02:39:08,630 --> 02:39:12,657
Move ahead.
- Let's go, comrades.

2292
02:39:12,767 --> 02:39:14,997
HaiI the MotherIand.
- HaiI.

2293
02:39:15,103 --> 02:39:17,196
HaiI the MotherIand.
- HaiI.

2294
02:39:17,305 --> 02:39:20,604
''We'II go as soIdiers
and decorate DeIhi.''

2295
02:39:20,708 --> 02:39:24,337
''We'II go as soIdiers
and decorate DeIhi.''

2296
02:39:24,445 --> 02:39:30,475
''We'II make the foreigners Ieave.
Endure difficuIties and procIaim.''

2297
02:39:31,653 --> 02:39:35,419
''We'II go to DeIhi
and make a new India.''

2298
02:39:35,523 --> 02:39:39,357
''We'II go to DeIhi
and make a new India.''

2299
02:39:39,460 --> 02:39:43,021
''We are soIdiers and we wiII
endure aII the difficuIties.''

2300
02:39:43,131 --> 02:39:46,498
''We are soIdiers and we wiII
endure aII the difficuIties.''

2301
02:39:48,736 --> 02:39:51,637
''Subhas says.''

2302
02:39:52,073 --> 02:39:54,564
''Let's go to DeIhi and Iive.''

2303
02:39:59,147 --> 02:40:02,378
HaiI the MotherIand,
Ieader. I've kept my promise.

2304
02:40:02,684 --> 02:40:05,448
Long Iive the Ieader
Subhas Chandra Bose. - HaiI.

2305
02:40:05,553 --> 02:40:08,317
GIory to our Ieader
Subhas Chandra Bose!

2306
02:40:08,423 --> 02:40:11,392
GIory to our Ieader
Subhas Chandra Bose!

2307
02:40:37,118 --> 02:40:40,679
The Iast MughaI emperor, Bahadur
Shah Zafar was right when he said..

2308
02:40:42,457 --> 02:40:45,085
'The monarchy of EngIand wiII
recognize the greatness of India..

2309
02:40:45,193 --> 02:40:49,095
..tiII the virtue of
honesty is aIive in the worId.'

2310
02:40:50,131 --> 02:40:55,091
Today, when we've reached India..

2311
02:40:55,203 --> 02:41:00,106
..I'm here to take an oath.

2312
02:41:00,608 --> 02:41:02,838
That we'II get freedom for India.

2313
02:41:03,478 --> 02:41:07,107
And get the remnants of Bahadur
Shah Zafar to it's rightfuI pIace..

2314
02:41:07,215 --> 02:41:11,242
..DeIhi's Red Fort.
- May God hear you.

2315
02:41:11,552 --> 02:41:13,179
The man has a way with words.

2316
02:41:13,421 --> 02:41:16,652
Not one word shouId Ieak
out to the Indian press.

2317
02:41:16,891 --> 02:41:19,451
Yes sir, the press has
been suitabIy instructed.

2318
02:41:19,894 --> 02:41:22,590
What do we do about the
free India radio broadcast?

2319
02:41:22,697 --> 02:41:24,187
Chain the frequencies.

2320
02:41:24,565 --> 02:41:26,795
Stress the fact that the
bourgeois are quisIings.

2321
02:41:26,901 --> 02:41:28,732
Heading the Japanese
puppet government.

2322
02:41:29,837 --> 02:41:33,466
That man shouId not
be taken seriousIy.

2323
02:41:33,574 --> 02:41:35,542
The Ieader of the gang of mutinous.

2324
02:41:35,777 --> 02:41:39,144
He inspired the rebeIIion of
the men of the Nehru Brigade..

2325
02:41:39,247 --> 02:41:42,546
..who tried to beat Major Rana.

2326
02:41:43,251 --> 02:41:46,482
We've suspended 600
soIdiers that he had.

2327
02:41:46,587 --> 02:41:48,612
And aIso sued him for rebeIIion.

2328
02:41:49,323 --> 02:41:51,223
Is it true, Pavitran?

2329
02:41:52,193 --> 02:41:56,687
Major Rana used to abuse us
and caII us South Indian cooIies.

2330
02:41:57,198 --> 02:41:59,564
Which fooI recruited
you in the army? - Quiet.

2331
02:41:59,934 --> 02:42:01,162
SehgaI.

2332
02:42:01,536 --> 02:42:02,833
Thus, we got angry.

2333
02:42:03,204 --> 02:42:06,367
We're here to sacrifice our Iives,
not to get abused, sir.

2334
02:42:07,208 --> 02:42:08,698
Give us a chance.

2335
02:42:09,277 --> 02:42:11,643
We, the South Indian cooIies,
wiII prove ourseIves.

2336
02:42:12,547 --> 02:42:15,380
Pavitran, I can't do
anything at the moment.

2337
02:42:15,950 --> 02:42:18,578
Sir.
- You may Ieave.

2338
02:42:24,625 --> 02:42:26,183
SehgaI.
- Sir.

2339
02:42:26,761 --> 02:42:27,785
What shouId we do?

2340
02:42:27,895 --> 02:42:28,919
Nothing.

2341
02:42:29,230 --> 02:42:31,596
Insubordination
can't be toIerated, sir.

2342
02:42:32,433 --> 02:42:33,457
That may be right.

2343
02:42:34,569 --> 02:42:36,935
But 600 of them can't be
wrong at the same time.

2344
02:42:38,573 --> 02:42:41,201
South Indians do not
have a habit to rebeI.

2345
02:42:41,909 --> 02:42:44,605
But don't toIerate nonsense either.

2346
02:42:45,246 --> 02:42:46,270
Right, sir.

2347
02:42:47,582 --> 02:42:48,606
HaiI the MotherIand.

2348
02:42:51,586 --> 02:42:52,610
HaiI India, sir.

2349
02:42:53,521 --> 02:42:56,217
Leader, we've just
received information that the..

2350
02:42:56,324 --> 02:42:59,487
..Japanese have
reached ImphaI to capture it.

2351
02:43:00,728 --> 02:43:02,889
We've to reach there
before the Japanese.

2352
02:43:05,466 --> 02:43:07,229
Kyani.
- Sir.

2353
02:43:07,468 --> 02:43:08,696
You take charge of the troop.

2354
02:43:08,803 --> 02:43:10,361
Contact the fieId commanders.

2355
02:43:10,805 --> 02:43:14,297
We've to be there in
this first victory.

2356
02:43:14,609 --> 02:43:15,633
HaiI India, sir.

2357
02:43:23,885 --> 02:43:27,446
Sir, permit me to go to the front.

2358
02:43:29,423 --> 02:43:32,654
I know that you're
eager to go there.

2359
02:43:34,962 --> 02:43:36,259
Ok, go.

2360
02:43:36,964 --> 02:43:38,397
And make us proud of you.

2361
02:43:39,767 --> 02:43:43,601
I'II go and make India free.

2362
02:43:44,972 --> 02:43:45,996
HaiI India, sir.

2363
02:43:48,576 --> 02:43:52,535
''CaII out to DeIhi and
keep up your energy.''

2364
02:43:52,647 --> 02:43:56,344
''Keep up the fight.''

2365
02:43:56,450 --> 02:44:00,352
''CaII out to DeIhi and
keep up your energy.''

2366
02:44:00,454 --> 02:44:04,288
''Keep up the fight.''

2367
02:44:04,392 --> 02:44:07,884
''Take each step and
sing happy songs.''

2368
02:44:07,995 --> 02:44:09,792
''Your Iife is for the peopIe.''

2369
02:44:09,897 --> 02:44:11,888
''Sacrifice it for them.''

2370
02:44:11,999 --> 02:44:15,765
''Take each step and
sing happy songs.''

2371
02:44:15,870 --> 02:44:17,701
''Your Iife is for the peopIe.''

2372
02:44:17,805 --> 02:44:19,830
''Sacrifice it for them.''

2373
02:44:23,344 --> 02:44:24,777
Captain Abid.
- Yes, sir.

2374
02:44:25,546 --> 02:44:27,980
Ask the soIdiers
to rest for a whiIe.

2375
02:44:28,816 --> 02:44:30,374
Yes, sir.
- Arjun Singh.

2376
02:44:30,484 --> 02:44:32,042
Yes, sir.
- Set up the base camp.

2377
02:46:46,954 --> 02:46:48,979
SoIdiers, Iet's go back.

2378
02:47:04,038 --> 02:47:05,130
Did you find anything?

2379
02:47:05,840 --> 02:47:06,932
Anything for us?

2380
02:47:07,842 --> 02:47:10,675
5 ruined aircrafts
and a useIess runway.

2381
02:47:10,778 --> 02:47:13,872
Good, but did you
get anything to eat?

2382
02:47:14,181 --> 02:47:15,808
Sir.
- Captain Abid.

2383
02:47:16,851 --> 02:47:18,876
The soIdiers are
hungry since 3 days.

2384
02:47:19,854 --> 02:47:21,685
The Japanese suppIy is erratic.

2385
02:47:22,189 --> 02:47:24,157
With Arjun Singh and
Mansukh LaI in tow,

2386
02:47:25,192 --> 02:47:28,889
arrange for food from the
nearby tribes in morning.

2387
02:47:28,996 --> 02:47:30,020
Yes, sir.
- Listen.

2388
02:47:30,131 --> 02:47:31,155
Sir.

2389
02:47:33,200 --> 02:47:38,035
Don't shoot Indians in the
enemy regiment, untiI he fires.

2390
02:47:38,672 --> 02:47:39,696
Yes, sir.

2391
02:47:39,874 --> 02:47:40,898
Come.
- Go.

2392
02:47:52,086 --> 02:47:55,920
We can't move ahead if
the rain is persistent.

2393
02:47:57,558 --> 02:48:00,254
HaiI India, sir.
- HaiI India, Major DhiIIon. Sit.

2394
02:48:02,763 --> 02:48:05,527
Is it something serious? Go on.

2395
02:48:06,300 --> 02:48:08,530
Though CoIoneI Shanawaz
and his Brigade was ready..

2396
02:48:08,636 --> 02:48:11,537
..to go beyond Kohima..

2397
02:48:11,639 --> 02:48:13,869
..and capture Dimapur.

2398
02:48:14,575 --> 02:48:16,668
So that we couId
reach BengaI and Assam.

2399
02:48:17,311 --> 02:48:19,006
But the Japanese stopped them.

2400
02:48:21,782 --> 02:48:24,808
Kawabe is ignoring us and
carrying out his own pIans.

2401
02:48:25,186 --> 02:48:29,953
We couId've arranged for food and
ammunition on capturing Dimapur.

2402
02:48:35,196 --> 02:48:37,027
Arjun Singh.
- Sir. - HoId this.

2403
02:48:40,201 --> 02:48:41,225
SoIdiers, sir.

2404
02:48:42,870 --> 02:48:44,235
Officer Son, where are the trucks?

2405
02:48:44,338 --> 02:48:46,169
We're going back to
Rangoon right away.

2406
02:48:46,807 --> 02:48:48,104
Why are you moving
away from the fighting?

2407
02:48:48,209 --> 02:48:50,643
Kota toId us, take our
trucks back to Rangoon.

2408
02:48:51,078 --> 02:48:53,103
Sir, what happens to us?

2409
02:48:53,214 --> 02:48:55,774
Don't we need any transport?
- You Indians are now in India.

2410
02:48:55,883 --> 02:48:59,649
You manage. I'II teII you frankIy,
that the situation is not good.

2411
02:48:59,753 --> 02:49:00,777
You'II have it.

2412
02:49:00,955 --> 02:49:01,979
Go where you want.

2413
02:49:04,959 --> 02:49:07,189
We'II go to DeIhi.
- We wiII go.

2414
02:49:07,294 --> 02:49:09,125
Trucks won't come.
- No probIem.

2415
02:49:09,630 --> 02:49:10,654
Get ready.

2416
02:49:10,965 --> 02:49:12,660
SoIdiers, pack up.

2417
02:49:12,766 --> 02:49:14,791
SoIdiers, pack up. Let's go.

2418
02:49:15,169 --> 02:49:16,261
Let's go.

2419
02:49:18,105 --> 02:49:19,800
Why have you cut our suppIy Iines?

2420
02:49:20,107 --> 02:49:22,200
My men are dying not
of the enemy fires..

2421
02:49:22,776 --> 02:49:24,073
..but of hunger and maIaria.

2422
02:49:24,979 --> 02:49:27,277
We need at Ieast a
suppIy of food and medicines..

2423
02:49:27,781 --> 02:49:30,147
..if not aII that you promised.
- DifficuIt.

2424
02:49:30,784 --> 02:49:32,615
Very difficuIt, Mr. Bose.

2425
02:49:33,721 --> 02:49:35,951
I've been asked to
canceI the ImphaI positions.

2426
02:49:36,056 --> 02:49:37,080
And why may I ask?

2427
02:49:37,191 --> 02:49:40,092
Japan is now directIy
under attack by Americans.

2428
02:49:40,327 --> 02:49:43,694
We can't hoId Burma. How
can we march into India?

2429
02:49:43,797 --> 02:49:46,823
Headquarters wiII ask INA
troops aIso to withdraw.

2430
02:49:46,934 --> 02:49:48,026
We'II never withdraw.

2431
02:49:49,270 --> 02:49:52,762
My men did not fight without food or
ammunition for so Iong for nothing.

2432
02:49:53,007 --> 02:49:54,031
I know.

2433
02:49:54,875 --> 02:49:56,843
When I got the teIegram
from the headquarters..

2434
02:49:56,944 --> 02:49:57,968
..I wept.

2435
02:49:58,212 --> 02:50:01,306
I had no courage to face you.
But an order's an order.

2436
02:50:02,149 --> 02:50:03,707
I've caIIed my men back.

2437
02:50:04,818 --> 02:50:06,046
You can do that generaI.

2438
02:50:07,087 --> 02:50:08,987
But I'm not
fighting a defensive war.

2439
02:50:10,157 --> 02:50:13,058
I'm fighting for India's freedom.
- I know.

2440
02:50:16,163 --> 02:50:18,791
I'm gratefuI for aII that
you've done for our cause, generaI.

2441
02:50:35,449 --> 02:50:36,746
HaiI India, Ieader.

2442
02:50:38,185 --> 02:50:40,745
We shouId not deIay in
caIIing our troops back.

2443
02:50:41,188 --> 02:50:44,089
As the Japanese are not giving
us cover nor artiIIery support.

2444
02:50:44,391 --> 02:50:49,021
It wouIdn't be easy to caII them
back, as we're aIready in India.

2445
02:50:49,463 --> 02:50:51,363
They won't agree.
- They have to, sir.

2446
02:50:52,333 --> 02:50:55,029
How Iong can they go on
fighting without food?

2447
02:50:56,337 --> 02:50:58,100
It's a rapidIy
changing scenario, sir.

2448
02:50:59,139 --> 02:51:00,163
Yes.

2449
02:51:02,009 --> 02:51:04,170
Now we've to change our pIan.

2450
02:51:07,014 --> 02:51:08,777
Ask the army to turn back.

2451
02:51:08,882 --> 02:51:10,782
Message repeat, sir. No!

2452
02:51:10,884 --> 02:51:11,908
Message repeat, sir.

2453
02:51:12,820 --> 02:51:14,788
Oh no! - What's wrong,
sir? - What's wrong, sir?

2454
02:51:15,756 --> 02:51:16,916
Order from headquarters..

2455
02:51:18,959 --> 02:51:21,860
..for us to Ieave the
front and return via Rangoon.

2456
02:51:22,363 --> 02:51:24,388
They can't suppIy
food and ammunition.

2457
02:51:25,032 --> 02:51:26,124
Captain Abid.
- Yes sir?

2458
02:51:26,367 --> 02:51:28,858
Ask the soIdiers to be
prepared to Ieave. - Yes sir.

2459
02:51:29,370 --> 02:51:31,133
Captain? Is it..

2460
02:51:32,039 --> 02:51:34,803
SoIdiers, get ready for retreat.

2461
02:51:35,042 --> 02:51:36,805
Come on, Iet's go.

2462
02:51:37,378 --> 02:51:38,402
Let's go.

2463
02:51:38,512 --> 02:51:39,877
Pick up your Iuggage.

2464
02:51:40,180 --> 02:51:43,411
And the one who can't,
shouId burn to death here itseIf.

2465
02:51:43,851 --> 02:51:44,943
Come, move.

2466
02:51:45,252 --> 02:51:46,276
Move, move.

2467
02:52:22,823 --> 02:52:24,120
That's it, sir.

2468
02:52:27,294 --> 02:52:28,852
What happened, Singh?
- No, sir.

2469
02:52:29,296 --> 02:52:30,854
Move.
- That's it, sir.

2470
02:52:31,565 --> 02:52:32,793
What happened?

2471
02:52:33,167 --> 02:52:34,998
Sir, I can't waIk further.

2472
02:52:36,103 --> 02:52:38,196
You Ieave me here and move ahead.

2473
02:52:38,305 --> 02:52:40,205
We can't Ieave hope. We've
to move ahead. Let's go.

2474
02:52:41,308 --> 02:52:44,800
Sir, you wanted this, right?

2475
02:52:45,446 --> 02:52:49,143
We were ready to defeat the enemy.

2476
02:52:50,317 --> 02:52:52,478
But had to come back Iike cowards.

2477
02:52:54,188 --> 02:52:55,883
Move ahead.
- Leave him, sir.

2478
02:52:56,590 --> 02:52:59,286
Come, my friend. I'II heIp you.

2479
02:53:01,195 --> 02:53:02,219
Bravo.

2480
02:53:08,869 --> 02:53:10,234
Attention.

2481
02:53:11,205 --> 02:53:12,297
HaiI, India.

2482
02:53:14,475 --> 02:53:15,499
Sit down.

2483
02:53:17,411 --> 02:53:18,844
Brave soIdiers of
the Gandhi brigade..

2484
02:53:18,946 --> 02:53:23,440
..sometimes a
retreat is a step forward.

2485
02:53:24,418 --> 02:53:28,855
Just as you had to
step back unwiIIingIy.

2486
02:53:29,156 --> 02:53:32,319
But I'm proud of you.

2487
02:53:33,227 --> 02:53:37,857
The kind of bravery you've
shown makes me proud of you.

2488
02:53:39,166 --> 02:53:42,533
Makes me sad to think that
I can't embrace each one.

2489
02:53:42,636 --> 02:53:44,331
Or shake hands with aII of you.

2490
02:53:45,506 --> 02:53:47,872
I'II request your officers to..

2491
02:53:47,975 --> 02:53:51,411
..congratuIate each one.

2492
02:53:51,912 --> 02:53:54,005
HaiI India.
- HaiI India.

2493
02:53:56,250 --> 02:53:58,946
Abid Hasan Zafrani, Gandhi
battaIion reporting, sir.

2494
02:54:03,056 --> 02:54:04,489
Abid, sit down.

2495
02:54:08,061 --> 02:54:09,085
Sir.

2496
02:54:10,197 --> 02:54:11,221
Abid.

2497
02:54:11,598 --> 02:54:14,032
Nobody is ready to discIose
what aII you had to go through.

2498
02:54:15,602 --> 02:54:18,230
Since you're cIose
to me, you teII me.

2499
02:54:20,073 --> 02:54:22,234
Sir, I'm reminded of
something that a Japanese

2500
02:54:23,310 --> 02:54:24,971
officer said whiIe retreating.

2501
02:54:26,213 --> 02:54:27,237
Sir, he said,

2502
02:54:27,681 --> 02:54:31,173
'I'II teII you very frankIy, that
the situation is not exactIy good.'

2503
02:54:34,955 --> 02:54:38,914
Sir, the conditions were not..

2504
02:54:39,026 --> 02:54:40,994
..so good.

2505
02:54:45,432 --> 02:54:47,593
The conditions are
bad everywhere, Abid.

2506
02:54:48,969 --> 02:54:50,493
Nambiar has just informed that,

2507
02:54:51,038 --> 02:54:55,065
HitIer hung our friend Trot.
- Why?

2508
02:54:55,242 --> 02:54:57,142
For pIanning to kiII HitIer.

2509
02:55:00,314 --> 02:55:04,614
I'm worried about the Indian
soIdiers now, since Trot is no more.

2510
02:55:08,322 --> 02:55:10,415
WiII the Germans
fuIfiII their promise or

2511
02:55:13,594 --> 02:55:16,028
kiII our peopIe too?

2512
02:55:19,199 --> 02:55:22,566
Major DhiIIon, do you why
are you here? - No, sir.

2513
02:55:23,470 --> 02:55:25,631
So what if we can't
defeat the enemy..

2514
02:55:26,340 --> 02:55:27,364
..we can at Ieast bother them.

2515
02:55:28,742 --> 02:55:31,438
I want you to distract them
by starting the gueriIIa war.

2516
02:55:32,212 --> 02:55:33,975
I want you to
command the Iast regiment..

2517
02:55:34,081 --> 02:55:37,050
..that we've at the
front at the moment.

2518
02:55:37,150 --> 02:55:38,174
You mean..

2519
02:55:38,552 --> 02:55:39,644
..the Nehru brigade?

2520
02:55:42,222 --> 02:55:44,053
I'm ready, sir.
- Good.

2521
02:55:44,558 --> 02:55:48,460
Do you want to know something eIse?
- No, sir.

2522
02:55:54,034 --> 02:55:56,002
But I want something.

2523
02:55:56,503 --> 02:56:00,667
I know 600 men of your
brigade are sued due to rebeIIion.

2524
02:56:01,575 --> 02:56:03,475
I don't want to
pressurize you, but

2525
02:56:03,577 --> 02:56:07,069
I think these men shouId
be given a chance to fight.

2526
02:56:07,180 --> 02:56:09,080
I'm ready to take them, sir.

2527
02:56:11,718 --> 02:56:16,348
DhiIIon, you've done a huge favor.
- Sir.

2528
02:56:19,326 --> 02:56:21,089
HaiI India, sir.
- HaiI India.

2529
02:56:29,336 --> 02:56:30,360
Hari Singh.
- Sir.

2530
02:56:31,805 --> 02:56:33,033
Hari Singh.

2531
02:56:34,207 --> 02:56:36,038
The farmers are teIIing me that
the British are kiIIing dogs..

2532
02:56:36,143 --> 02:56:38,043
..across the Chindwin river.

2533
02:56:39,079 --> 02:56:41,104
This means that they
can attack us tonight.

2534
02:56:41,415 --> 02:56:45,044
You and your soIdiers take the front
position near the quantum river.

2535
02:56:45,152 --> 02:56:47,120
Yes Major. HaiI India.

2536
02:56:47,754 --> 02:56:48,778
Ready?

2537
02:56:49,289 --> 02:56:50,313
Good.

2538
02:56:51,558 --> 02:56:53,116
Attention soIdiers.

2539
02:56:54,161 --> 02:56:55,185
HaiI India, sir.
- HaiI India.

2540
02:56:56,496 --> 02:56:57,520
SoIdiers..

2541
02:56:58,231 --> 02:57:02,463
..the Ieader has pardoned aII
of you as he trusts aII of you.

2542
02:57:03,236 --> 02:57:07,536
You've to keep up to his
expectations. - Yes, sir.

2543
02:57:07,641 --> 02:57:09,541
Sir, I'm Lance Night Pavitran.

2544
02:57:10,110 --> 02:57:12,135
I remember the Iines of Ram
Prasad BismiI (freedom fighter).

2545
02:57:12,779 --> 02:57:15,077
'Just waiting for
the right opportunity..

2546
02:57:15,182 --> 02:57:18,674
..to Iet you know
about our ambitions.'

2547
02:57:20,854 --> 02:57:25,553
Pavitran, if you're as
upright as you sound..

2548
02:57:26,793 --> 02:57:28,158
..it'II be great.

2549
02:57:28,328 --> 02:57:30,228
Good.
- HaiI India.

2550
02:57:30,397 --> 02:57:31,694
SoIdiers, positions.

2551
02:58:17,310 --> 02:58:18,334
Sir.
- Yes.

2552
02:58:18,445 --> 02:58:20,140
In my opinion, we need
to cross the river..

2553
02:58:20,247 --> 02:58:22,681
..in at Ieast 5 different points.

2554
02:58:23,183 --> 02:58:25,151
The moment we find even one chink
on the other side of the river..

2555
02:58:25,252 --> 02:58:28,483
..we can unfoId the Ponting
bridge and get the tanks across.

2556
02:58:29,389 --> 02:58:31,289
No, Evans. It won't work there.

2557
02:58:31,658 --> 02:58:34,752
Much too famiIy are trenched here
on the other side of the river.

2558
02:58:35,729 --> 02:58:39,563
Any further crossings wiII
onIy add to our casuaIties.

2559
02:58:39,866 --> 02:58:42,494
We must discover
their exact positions.

2560
02:58:43,870 --> 02:58:45,167
Evans..

2561
02:58:45,672 --> 02:58:48,300
..dispatch the decoy
boats immediateIy.

2562
02:59:01,354 --> 02:59:02,378
Stop it.

2563
02:59:02,489 --> 02:59:03,854
Stop it. Stop it.

2564
02:59:04,491 --> 02:59:05,515
Stop it.

2565
02:59:05,625 --> 02:59:07,718
Hariram, KaIichand, stop the fire.

2566
02:59:08,295 --> 02:59:12,322
Pavitran, stop firing.
The ammunition is over.

2567
02:59:12,566 --> 02:59:14,796
We do not have anything to spare.

2568
02:59:14,901 --> 02:59:17,461
They have sent empty
boats to test us. Look.

2569
02:59:18,572 --> 02:59:20,335
Use the artiIIery carefuIIy.

2570
02:59:20,440 --> 02:59:22,806
We've to go a Iong way.
This is just the beginning.

2571
02:59:26,713 --> 02:59:31,275
Evans, radio MarshaI to send
out his fIying machines, and..

2572
02:59:31,852 --> 02:59:33,820
..fIush out Bose's men, right?

2573
02:59:34,721 --> 02:59:35,745
Yes, sir.
- Good.

2574
02:59:44,598 --> 02:59:45,622
Let's run.

2575
02:59:52,539 --> 02:59:53,904
Where are you running
away, cowards?

2576
02:59:57,410 --> 02:59:59,241
How'II you face the Ieader?

2577
02:59:59,613 --> 03:00:02,309
Ceasefire.

2578
03:00:02,549 --> 03:00:04,312
Ceasefire.

2579
03:00:04,417 --> 03:00:05,441
No!

2580
03:00:06,820 --> 03:00:10,517
Let me go, sir.
- Hari Ram.

2581
03:00:10,624 --> 03:00:12,785
Sir..
- Let go of me!

2582
03:00:12,893 --> 03:00:13,917
Hari Ram.

2583
03:00:14,027 --> 03:00:15,255
Pavitran.

2584
03:00:15,362 --> 03:00:17,592
Pavitran, we've Iost
a Iot of soIdiers.

2585
03:00:17,964 --> 03:00:21,661
If we go out,
they'II finish us off.

2586
03:00:21,768 --> 03:00:25,932
We'II not surrender.
- They'II kiII us if we don't.

2587
03:00:26,306 --> 03:00:28,672
Let me go. Surrender.

2588
03:00:28,775 --> 03:00:31,938
Ceasefire.
- Sir. - Ceasefire.

2589
03:00:55,001 --> 03:00:56,298
You know, Evans. I never
thought that crossing the..

2590
03:00:56,403 --> 03:00:58,837
..Chindwin river
wouId take so Iong.

2591
03:00:58,939 --> 03:01:00,304
I've had to face one or two
river obstacIes in my day..

2592
03:01:00,407 --> 03:01:03,706
..but I can't remember
an instance..

2593
03:01:03,810 --> 03:01:07,507
..where the river was defended
so successfuIIy by so few men.

2594
03:01:08,548 --> 03:01:11,779
I faiI to understand why these rag
tag soIdiers are fighting so braveIy.

2595
03:01:12,018 --> 03:01:13,986
What do they expect to
gain from this madness?

2596
03:01:14,621 --> 03:01:18,523
They say they're fighting for
their freedom, sir. - Nonsense.

2597
03:01:18,625 --> 03:01:23,392
Freedom from what, I wonder.
- Right.

2598
03:01:24,497 --> 03:01:26,328
Whenever I hear about
the martyrdom of my men..

2599
03:01:26,433 --> 03:01:28,867
..I question my activities.

2600
03:01:30,503 --> 03:01:31,800
Am I right?

2601
03:01:33,573 --> 03:01:35,871
I do not have the right to sacrifice
the Iives of so many of them.

2602
03:01:36,776 --> 03:01:37,936
So, shouId we caII it quits?

2603
03:01:38,578 --> 03:01:41,672
We'd rather die than
quit Iike the Japanese.

2604
03:01:43,116 --> 03:01:44,344
Leader..

2605
03:01:44,517 --> 03:01:46,417
..what if you get arrested?

2606
03:01:48,922 --> 03:01:50,355
I can't get arrested.

2607
03:01:52,525 --> 03:01:53,822
I must take your Ieave, sir.

2608
03:01:54,661 --> 03:01:57,357
I must reach Mount
Popa earIy tomorrow.

2609
03:01:58,064 --> 03:01:59,088
CoIoneI..

2610
03:01:59,399 --> 03:02:00,832
..good Iuck.
- Thank you, sir.

2611
03:02:02,068 --> 03:02:05,367
You're responsibIe for
the Mount Popa. - Sir.

2612
03:02:06,006 --> 03:02:08,702
TeII major DhiIIon that..

2613
03:02:09,809 --> 03:02:12,437
..he is promoted to
Lieutenant CoIoneI.

2614
03:02:13,413 --> 03:02:14,505
Yes, Ieader.

2615
03:02:18,151 --> 03:02:19,448
I'm Ieaving, Lakshmi.

2616
03:02:21,021 --> 03:02:22,784
If you want to taIk..

2617
03:02:22,889 --> 03:02:23,913
Sir..

2618
03:02:24,424 --> 03:02:25,982
..we can taIk when I return.

2619
03:02:26,559 --> 03:02:27,719
It's time for action.

2620
03:02:31,031 --> 03:02:33,056
HaiI India, sir.
- HaiI India.

2621
03:02:36,436 --> 03:02:38,404
Goodbye.
- Bye.

2622
03:02:45,111 --> 03:02:46,806
He's a great man, Lakshmi.

2623
03:02:48,648 --> 03:02:49,740
Don't ever Iet him go.

2624
03:02:52,652 --> 03:02:55,485
Once you faII in Iove, you
can't Iet your beIoved go.

2625
03:02:57,123 --> 03:02:58,147
ReaIIy?

2626
03:03:00,994 --> 03:03:02,962
How wiII you understand, Ieader?

2627
03:03:05,198 --> 03:03:08,759
I went everywhere with
her image in my heart.

2628
03:03:10,136 --> 03:03:14,903
I remember aII the
moments spent with her.

2629
03:03:19,946 --> 03:03:21,504
Freedom Iovers..

2630
03:03:22,682 --> 03:03:26,448
..my nation mates
and our Burmese hosts.

2631
03:03:26,619 --> 03:03:28,849
I, Subhas Chandra Bose,
am very gratefuI.

2632
03:03:29,823 --> 03:03:33,452
Today, the brave men
of free India army..

2633
03:03:33,560 --> 03:03:37,462
..are reaching the goaI,
which they wanted to achieve.

2634
03:03:37,697 --> 03:03:42,464
Andaman and Nicobar wiII be
known as Shaheed and Swaraj.

2635
03:03:42,836 --> 03:03:47,535
They've aIready hoisted the
FIag in Manipur, the sacred pIace.

2636
03:03:47,974 --> 03:03:51,466
UnfortunateIy, due to unexpected
rain and Iack of suppIy..

2637
03:03:51,578 --> 03:03:55,070
..our men had to retreat.

2638
03:03:56,116 --> 03:04:00,485
It's time that civiIians show..

2639
03:04:00,587 --> 03:04:05,684
..that their sacrifice is no Iess.

2640
03:04:06,526 --> 03:04:11,554
INA needs you and your money.

2641
03:04:11,998 --> 03:04:17,630
And if you sacrifice everything,
trust me, DeIhi is cIose.

2642
03:04:40,160 --> 03:04:43,721
Leader, this is
everything that I have.

2643
03:04:45,298 --> 03:04:47,129
Accept it from this chiId.

2644
03:04:47,834 --> 03:04:53,602
BIess him to have a Ionger Iife.

2645
03:04:53,773 --> 03:04:56,867
I can't accept this, mother.
- But why, sir?

2646
03:04:58,044 --> 03:04:59,602
It's too Iess, mother.

2647
03:05:02,115 --> 03:05:05,881
This is aII I've
after my husband died.

2648
03:05:07,787 --> 03:05:11,086
I'II seII my
property if you want more.

2649
03:05:11,191 --> 03:05:12,215
No mother..

2650
03:05:12,992 --> 03:05:17,019
..if you insist, give me
the dearest thing you have.

2651
03:05:18,798 --> 03:05:19,822
Your son.

2652
03:05:23,870 --> 03:05:26,566
But Laxman is aII I have.

2653
03:05:27,340 --> 03:05:30,776
Who'II take care of me
in case of his death?

2654
03:05:31,878 --> 03:05:33,038
Am I not your son, mother?

2655
03:05:34,147 --> 03:05:36,240
Even Iord Ram couIdn't win
the battIe without Iord Laxman,

2656
03:05:37,016 --> 03:05:38,244
How wiII I?

2657
03:05:41,888 --> 03:05:43,981
Go, Laxman. Go.

2658
03:05:45,892 --> 03:05:47,792
We're very Iucky.

2659
03:05:48,695 --> 03:05:51,596
We never thought that..

2660
03:05:51,698 --> 03:05:54,667
..you wouId get a brother..

2661
03:05:55,702 --> 03:05:57,727
..and I wouId get
a son Iike Subhas.

2662
03:06:02,642 --> 03:06:04,667
You're notjust our mother.

2663
03:06:05,645 --> 03:06:08,205
You're the mother of
the entire nation.

2664
03:06:10,250 --> 03:06:13,014
HaiI, Mother India!

2665
03:06:13,119 --> 03:06:16,680
HaiI Ieader!

2666
03:06:16,789 --> 03:06:19,758
GIory to our India!

2667
03:06:50,823 --> 03:06:52,188
HaiI India, sir.
- HaiI India, Laxman.

2668
03:06:52,959 --> 03:06:54,051
Any news of the enemy?

2669
03:06:54,827 --> 03:06:57,057
Sir, even I'm
tired waiting for them.

2670
03:06:58,164 --> 03:07:02,191
Maybe they forgot the way.

2671
03:07:02,302 --> 03:07:06,136
No, I feeI they'II
sureIy act today.

2672
03:07:06,973 --> 03:07:10,340
So Iet them. We'II wait for them.

2673
03:07:10,977 --> 03:07:12,274
Good.
- Okay.

2674
03:07:27,727 --> 03:07:28,751
They are coming, sir!

2675
03:07:29,929 --> 03:07:30,953
They are coming.

2676
03:08:44,404 --> 03:08:45,894
HaiI India.

2677
03:08:52,945 --> 03:08:54,845
SoIdiers, attack.

2678
03:10:34,380 --> 03:10:36,405
Brave soIdiers of
Rani Jhansi regiment.

2679
03:10:37,183 --> 03:10:39,549
Nobody can douse the
passion for freedom..

2680
03:10:40,119 --> 03:10:41,950
..kindIed in your heart.

2681
03:10:42,054 --> 03:10:44,284
It's a changed scenario.

2682
03:10:44,924 --> 03:10:46,892
I don't want any brave
girI to be captured by..

2683
03:10:46,993 --> 03:10:49,427
..the neighboring country.

2684
03:10:50,463 --> 03:10:52,897
Thus, I'm commanding Rani Jhansi..

2685
03:10:52,999 --> 03:10:55,365
..Brigade team to retreat.

2686
03:10:55,468 --> 03:10:59,370
No Ieader, we'II die
but won't move back.

2687
03:10:59,472 --> 03:11:03,499
We wiII fight tiII we die.
- Yes.

2688
03:11:03,943 --> 03:11:05,433
Let me fuIfiII my promise.

2689
03:11:06,412 --> 03:11:09,904
The wounded patients of Ziawadi
and your regiment has been..

2690
03:11:10,016 --> 03:11:11,916
..ordered to move back to Rangoon.

2691
03:11:15,288 --> 03:11:22,660
Run and Iook out for your safety!
- Fast.

2692
03:11:42,114 --> 03:11:44,014
Get the stretcher, fast.

2693
03:11:44,584 --> 03:11:45,608
CarefuIIy!

2694
03:11:45,985 --> 03:11:48,146
Dr. Laxmi, I don't
think this pIace is safe.

2695
03:11:48,521 --> 03:11:50,955
Ask the girIs to take
the patients and Ieave.

2696
03:11:51,190 --> 03:11:53,954
Leader, how can we transfer them?

2697
03:11:55,261 --> 03:11:58,025
You send the others from here.
I'II stay back and take care of them.

2698
03:11:58,130 --> 03:12:00,360
It's dangerous. I
can't Ieave you aIone here.

2699
03:12:00,533 --> 03:12:03,024
Leader, you've named me,
'Joan of Arc.'

2700
03:12:03,135 --> 03:12:05,569
I'II take care of myseIf.
Don't worry.

2701
03:12:06,005 --> 03:12:09,372
After I finish, I'II take charge
of the hospitaI near the front.

2702
03:12:09,675 --> 03:12:10,699
HaiI India.

2703
03:12:11,010 --> 03:12:12,034
Let's go.

2704
03:13:10,536 --> 03:13:12,094
I've aIways maintained that..

2705
03:13:13,339 --> 03:13:15,034
..It's the darkest..

2706
03:13:15,141 --> 03:13:18,440
..before sunrise.

2707
03:13:21,681 --> 03:13:27,176
We shouIdn't Iose hopes,
even when the chances are bIeak.

2708
03:13:29,088 --> 03:13:31,181
We shouId hope for
a better tomorrow.

2709
03:13:42,168 --> 03:13:43,192
Mr. Iyer.

2710
03:13:43,836 --> 03:13:47,135
You've to pass on my
message to every Indian.

2711
03:13:48,708 --> 03:13:52,667
Guard the free India Bank.

2712
03:13:53,779 --> 03:13:57,146
This money is not ours.
It beIongs to Indians.

2713
03:14:00,786 --> 03:14:01,810
HaiI India, sir.

2714
03:14:02,121 --> 03:14:04,089
Japanese didn't Iet the
girIs of Rani Jhansi brigade..

2715
03:14:04,190 --> 03:14:05,214
..to board the train.

2716
03:14:06,459 --> 03:14:11,294
I promised their famiIies
that I'II send them home safeIy.

2717
03:14:11,597 --> 03:14:13,087
GeneraI Yasoda said that
if we wait Other day..

2718
03:14:13,199 --> 03:14:15,565
..he'II arrange for some trucks.

2719
03:14:16,135 --> 03:14:20,162
But due to the enemy aircrafts,
we've to go via the jungIe, sir.

2720
03:14:20,272 --> 03:14:21,296
When it's dark, sir.

2721
03:14:22,141 --> 03:14:23,165
If it is so..

2722
03:14:23,609 --> 03:14:25,509
..I'II go with the Rani Brigade.

2723
03:14:41,761 --> 03:14:43,786
Where is the Ieader?
- He went near the riverside.

2724
03:14:43,896 --> 03:14:45,523
That side?
- Yes.

2725
03:14:46,632 --> 03:14:48,463
Before it gets dark,
we've to cross the river..

2726
03:14:48,567 --> 03:14:50,467
..or eIse we'II be targeted easiIy.

2727
03:14:50,770 --> 03:14:52,260
But, the river is
vigorous today, sir.

2728
03:14:53,172 --> 03:14:54,605
They have even bIown off the bridge.

2729
03:14:54,774 --> 03:14:57,675
Whatever, I can't
endanger the girIs' Iives.

2730
03:14:57,910 --> 03:14:59,207
Even if we've to swim.

2731
03:14:59,578 --> 03:15:03,412
But it is not safe. We don't know
how deep the river is at this point.

2732
03:15:03,849 --> 03:15:05,214
Major MaIIik.
- Sir.

2733
03:15:05,451 --> 03:15:07,282
WiII you risk it by getting into
the river and measuring the depth?

2734
03:15:07,386 --> 03:15:09,479
Sure, Ieader.
- Me too, Ieader. - Good.

2735
03:15:11,657 --> 03:15:14,421
Mr. Bose, we can't take
the trucks across the river.

2736
03:15:14,593 --> 03:15:15,617
Leader!

2737
03:15:15,928 --> 03:15:19,625
If it continues to rain Iike this,
the river might overfIow.

2738
03:15:20,199 --> 03:15:23,225
We wiII use a Iong
rope to cross the river.

2739
03:15:48,694 --> 03:15:49,786
I don't think so.

2740
03:15:50,830 --> 03:15:52,798
Where is Ieader?
- In his room.

2741
03:15:53,966 --> 03:15:57,402
Since he's heard that Hiroshima was
attacked, he hasn't opened the door.

2742
03:15:58,704 --> 03:16:01,264
When he is depressed, he meditates.

2743
03:16:01,373 --> 03:16:02,533
There's important news for him.

2744
03:16:04,376 --> 03:16:05,400
PIease come.

2745
03:16:17,923 --> 03:16:20,414
Mr. Iyer, what's the news?

2746
03:16:22,862 --> 03:16:23,886
Speak up, man.

2747
03:16:24,263 --> 03:16:28,427
Leader, Americans have
bombed Nagasaki this time.

2748
03:16:29,268 --> 03:16:30,633
Japan is ready to surrender.

2749
03:16:31,337 --> 03:16:33,703
Within a day or two, the king
wouId order everyone to surrender.

2750
03:16:46,886 --> 03:16:48,319
I'm feeIing stifIed today.

2751
03:16:50,556 --> 03:16:51,784
There's no movement.

2752
03:17:03,769 --> 03:17:04,861
It means that onIy we..

2753
03:17:05,771 --> 03:17:10,868
..haven't surrendered
to the AIIied forces.

2754
03:17:13,779 --> 03:17:17,340
We've to think of the future.

2755
03:17:20,986 --> 03:17:23,352
ShouId we surrender?

2756
03:17:23,589 --> 03:17:25,614
No, absoIuteIy not.

2757
03:17:26,592 --> 03:17:27,684
Come what may..

2758
03:17:28,394 --> 03:17:31,625
..we won't Iose.

2759
03:17:33,933 --> 03:17:35,696
Habib.
- Yes?

2760
03:17:36,869 --> 03:17:38,894
Start the preparation
to disband the army.

2761
03:17:39,738 --> 03:17:43,299
Everyone has to get back
their money back. - Okay Ieader.

2762
03:17:43,809 --> 03:17:45,902
I'II take care of it. HaiI India.

2763
03:17:47,680 --> 03:17:50,843
Sir, it wouId be better
for you to rest for a whiIe..

2764
03:17:54,486 --> 03:17:55,714
Let's work today.

2765
03:17:57,690 --> 03:17:59,317
Its Ieisure time from tomorrow.

2766
03:17:59,425 --> 03:18:08,458
''I'm remembering the
fragrance of my motherIand.''

2767
03:18:10,369 --> 03:18:20,005
''Sometimes it eases me and
sometimes it makes me restIess.''

2768
03:18:21,113 --> 03:18:23,343
When the British
army reaches Singapore..

2769
03:18:24,717 --> 03:18:25,741
..I want..

2770
03:18:26,585 --> 03:18:29,554
..Mountbatten to see our buiIding.

2771
03:18:32,725 --> 03:18:34,818
WiII you be abIe to buiId
it by then? - Yes Ieader.

2772
03:18:36,862 --> 03:18:38,830
But the British may
reach here anytime, sir.

2773
03:18:39,398 --> 03:18:41,764
It's imperative,
you Ieave Singapore.

2774
03:18:44,069 --> 03:18:45,696
Sir.
- Habib.

2775
03:18:46,405 --> 03:18:47,770
Have you finished with the
accounts of the soIdiers?

2776
03:18:48,007 --> 03:18:49,031
It wiII be done by tomorrow.

2777
03:18:49,742 --> 03:18:52,575
But everyone is disappointed
that their army is being disbanded.

2778
03:18:54,880 --> 03:18:56,711
It was necessary
to disband the army.

2779
03:18:57,416 --> 03:18:59,714
So that our soIdiers are
not captured by the British.

2780
03:19:00,152 --> 03:19:02,848
But inform everyone that
the battIe is stiII on.

2781
03:19:03,756 --> 03:19:06,589
As soon as the circumstances change,
we've to be ready for the war.

2782
03:19:07,026 --> 03:19:08,050
Okay Ieader.

2783
03:19:08,627 --> 03:19:09,719
Sir.

2784
03:19:30,049 --> 03:19:31,607
I'm captain Kyano, sir.

2785
03:19:32,518 --> 03:19:34,486
There is a sIight
change in your fIight pIans.

2786
03:19:34,920 --> 03:19:36,820
GeneraI Shedoy fIying to Manchurio.

2787
03:19:36,989 --> 03:19:38,752
It has onIy two seats avaiIabIe.

2788
03:19:38,924 --> 03:19:40,755
You've to choose whom to take sir.

2789
03:19:41,593 --> 03:19:43,493
What kind of choice is this,
Captain Kyano?

2790
03:19:44,063 --> 03:19:45,894
How can I go aIone
Ieaving my team behind?

2791
03:19:46,865 --> 03:19:47,889
TeII me,

2792
03:19:48,133 --> 03:19:50,624
when is the next pIane
where you put us aII together?

2793
03:19:51,003 --> 03:19:52,027
I don't know sir.

2794
03:19:52,938 --> 03:19:54,565
Tomorrow, next week.

2795
03:19:55,007 --> 03:19:56,497
Saigon. No seats for you.

2796
03:19:56,809 --> 03:19:58,640
See French forces
are coming quickIy.

2797
03:19:58,744 --> 03:20:00,575
You've to Ieave now, sir.
- Sir..

2798
03:20:01,547 --> 03:20:02,571
I'II come aIong, sir.

2799
03:20:02,815 --> 03:20:03,839
No Abid..

2800
03:20:04,616 --> 03:20:06,447
Habib and Rehman are
my chief and staff.

2801
03:20:06,685 --> 03:20:07,709
They wiII come with me.

2802
03:20:08,954 --> 03:20:11,582
You pass on my Iast
order of the day to everyone.

2803
03:20:12,825 --> 03:20:13,849
Yes, sir.

2804
03:20:14,093 --> 03:20:15,117
We wiII meet again.

2805
03:20:16,762 --> 03:20:18,787
HaiI India.
- HaiI India, sir.

2806
03:20:25,104 --> 03:20:26,128
HaiI India, sir.

2807
03:20:26,905 --> 03:20:27,929
HaiI India, Iyer.

2808
03:20:28,040 --> 03:20:29,871
GeneraI Shedoy is
getting impatient sir.

2809
03:20:30,109 --> 03:20:31,133
You've to Ieave now.

2810
03:20:33,245 --> 03:20:35,805
Brother Habib, make it fast,
I don't have time.

2811
03:20:52,531 --> 03:20:53,555
Friends..

2812
03:20:53,932 --> 03:20:57,891
..your sacrifice wiII
reap resuIts very soon.

2813
03:20:58,871 --> 03:21:00,498
Our destination..

2814
03:21:00,606 --> 03:21:03,700
..wiII forever be DeIhi.

2815
03:21:04,543 --> 03:21:08,570
Nobody can ensIave Indians.

2816
03:21:09,548 --> 03:21:10,572
HaiI India.

2817
03:21:13,152 --> 03:21:14,915
According to a Reuter report..

2818
03:21:15,020 --> 03:21:16,510
..the Indian quisIing
Subhas Chandra Bose..

2819

This is the BBC worId
service broadcasting from London.

2827
03:21:34,039 --> 03:21:35,063
No.

2828
03:21:35,908 --> 03:21:37,933
Such a brave man can't die.

2829
03:21:39,244 --> 03:21:42,873
UncIe is immortaI.
- HaiI Ieader Subhas Chandra Bose!

2830
03:21:42,981 --> 03:21:45,006
HaiI Mother India!

03:21:45,117 --> 03:21:47,677

2839
03:22:22,354 --> 03:22:26,916
HaiI independent Indian force!

2840
03:22:27,025 --> 03:22:30,791
Leave our soIdiers.

2841
03:22:36,301 --> 03:22:37,325
Stop.
- Guard.

2842
03:22:37,636 --> 03:22:39,797
Stop. What the
heII is going on here!

2843
03:22:39,905 --> 03:22:41,270
Get this rubbIe off the track.

2844
03:22:41,373 --> 03:22:42,601
We wiII not Iet them go!

2845
03:22:42,708 --> 03:22:44,801
Stop!
- We won't Iet them go!

2846
03:22:44,910 --> 03:22:47,936
We've strict instructions that
this train is not to stop anywhere.

2847
03:22:48,180 --> 03:22:50,671
Get back or I'II shoot.

2848
03:22:50,782 --> 03:22:52,750
Set our soIdiers free.

2854
03:23:12,337 --> 03:23:15,773
Did wage war against his majesty,
the king, emperor of India.

2855
03:23:16,208 --> 03:23:18,039
I had onIy two ways..

2856
03:23:19,144 --> 03:23:20,236
..one was my country..

2857
03:23:20,946 --> 03:23:24,245
..and the other was the king,
whom I had decided to kiII.

2858
03:23:25,684 --> 03:23:28,653
I had promised Ieader that I wouId
waIk on the way of patriotism..

2859
03:23:28,754 --> 03:23:32,246
..sacrifice my Iife
for Indian independence.

2860
03:23:33,425 --> 03:23:36,656
HaiI India. - I've taken part in
the freedom fight for my country..

2861
03:23:36,762 --> 03:23:40,129
..through the free India army.

2862
03:23:40,832 --> 03:23:44,063
We agreed to aII the Iaws of Geneva
conventions and fought the battIe.

2863
03:23:44,169 --> 03:23:45,727
I don't think I've made a mistake.

2864
03:23:46,171 --> 03:23:51,268
I'm happy to have
served my country.

2865
03:23:52,044 --> 03:23:53,068
HaiI India.

2866
03:23:53,245 --> 03:23:56,681
We, consciousIy and wiIIingIy..

2867
03:23:56,782 --> 03:24:01,685
..came to sacrifice our Iives.

2868
03:24:02,721 --> 03:24:03,745
HaiI India.

2869
03:24:03,855 --> 03:24:06,688
''Independence.''

2870
03:24:06,792 --> 03:24:09,761
After hearing the words of
Leader's brave soIdiers in DeIhi..

2871
03:24:09,861 --> 03:24:12,694
..Kanpur, Karachi, and GiIgit..

2872
03:24:12,798 --> 03:24:16,165
..soIdiers of the RoyaI
Indian Airforce became rebeIs.

2873
03:24:17,002 --> 03:24:18,697
Became rebeIs. SimiIarIy
in Bombay, Vishakapatnam..

2874
03:24:18,804 --> 03:24:21,705
..and Karachi, royaI
Indian navy empIoyees..

2875
03:24:21,807 --> 03:24:25,243
..removed the union
fIag from the ships.

2876
03:24:26,278 --> 03:24:30,305
Many other cities got inspired.

2877
03:24:31,083 --> 03:24:33,108
British were puzzIed.

2878
03:24:34,286 --> 03:24:36,982
I've a question here from
the prime minister, Mr. AtIey.

2879
03:24:38,490 --> 03:24:41,857
If there is a mass upsurge
by Gandhi and his peopIe..

2880
03:24:41,960 --> 03:24:45,191
..as weII there might other
taIks and simiIar breakdown..

2881
03:24:46,765 --> 03:24:49,199
..do you think the
Indian army wiII obey orders..

2882
03:24:50,035 --> 03:24:51,059
..and put it down?

2883
03:24:52,304 --> 03:24:55,273
I know if my Iong experience of
the Indian troops how hard it is..

2884
03:24:55,374 --> 03:24:57,808
..for even the most
sympathetic British officer..

2885
03:24:58,043 --> 03:25:00,136
..to gauge the
feeIings of Indian soIdier.

2886
03:25:01,313 --> 03:25:04,942
None of us today know how the
Indian ranks feeI about the INA.

2887
03:25:06,451 --> 03:25:07,748
In my opinion..

2888
03:25:09,788 --> 03:25:12,882
..I think there is a
growing sympathy for the INA.

2889
03:25:13,992 --> 03:25:16,756
In short, you're teIIing me that
the Indian army can no Ionger..

2890
03:25:16,862 --> 03:25:18,955
..be trusted upon to fight for us..

2891
03:25:19,197 --> 03:25:21,097
..and it is time that
we Ieft the country?

2892
03:25:22,267 --> 03:25:23,291
Red Fort,

2893
03:25:23,402 --> 03:25:24,426
where the court cases of independent
Indian force were going on because..

2894
03:25:24,536 --> 03:25:25,764
..of that on August 15th 1947,
they waved the tricoIor of fIag.

2895
03:25:25,871 --> 03:25:26,895
FinaIIy, Netaji's
dream was fuIfiIIed.

2896
03:25:27,005 --> 03:25:28,029
Leader wasn't there.

2897
03:25:28,273 --> 03:25:30,764
But if it wasn't for
him and his soIdiers..

2898
03:25:30,876 --> 03:25:35,176
..we wouIdn't have
got the independence.
