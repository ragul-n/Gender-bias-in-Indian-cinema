1
00:01:53,474 --> 00:02:00,398
'Common Man'

2
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,660
What are you doing?

3
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,140
Don't do

4
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,780
Give me your number

5
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,860
Come fast

6
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,740
Number

7
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,580
I can't hear
what you're saying

8
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,420
Damn it

9
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,340
Tell me your number, damn it

10
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,140
I'll kill you
if I get my hands on you

11
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,700
What?
What the hell-

12
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,380
What's your problem?
What are you trying to do?

13
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,400
On Saturday night, six labourers
including a child sleeping on a pavement...

14
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,480
...were mowed down
by a car near Guindy

15
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,640
The famous lawyer, Aadhiseshan
is going to defend Rahul Diwan, the accused

16
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,640
College student Divya's rape case-

17
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,840
'There's no challenge
Ullaganathan can't handle'

18
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:46,215
I am sure he can't give
a peaceful life to my daughter

19
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,120
Always fighting with my daughter
So please get them divorce

20
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,760
Why do you ask again?

21
00:04:50,935 --> 00:04:53,415
Sir, you're reading News paper
Please listen to me

22
00:04:53,705 --> 00:04:55,705
Madam, please attend the work

23
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,680
Will I get bail at least today?

24
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,600
Your lines look dark and bleak

25
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,320
There's no hope

26
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,720
Take a good look

27
00:05:09,745 --> 00:05:11,225
I have looked at it

28
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,920
The lines on your palms
look like the bars in jail

29
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,840
There's no way you'll get bail

30
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,640
- Who's your lawyer?
- Sakthi sir

31
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:24,013
You mean Sakthi?
Forget about your bail

32
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,040
He calls him 'Sakthi sir'

33
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,600
What are you saying?

34
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,000
Your stealing is not the problem

35
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,240
That you approached Sakthi
is the real problem

36
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,200
Nothing can save you now

37
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,720
You're right

38
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,160
That's enough of working
Please have this 'laddu'

39
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,240
- Thank you
- Please take some

40
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,400
Take it , bro

41
00:05:46,658 --> 00:05:48,520
There's enough for everyone

42
00:05:48,662 --> 00:05:49,942
I want some too

43
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,560
What's the occasion?

44
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,000
Madam has come

45
00:05:57,252 --> 00:06:00,132
Madam, please have some 'laddu'
It's your birthday

46
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:06,293
Birthdays come every year
Let's focus on work

47
00:06:09,497 --> 00:06:12,817
Doctor Kulandhai

48
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,560
Kulandhaiswamy is
the most gifted doctor in town

49
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,080
A lot of people are jealous of him

50
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,560
The police and the media
have made a big deal out of a non-issue

51
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,240
What are you saying?

52
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,640
His 14 years old son
has operated on a pregnant woman

53
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,600
How can that be a non-issue?

54
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,640
That's a blatant lie

55
00:06:49,901 --> 00:06:51,840
The boy was inside
the operation theatre...

56
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:54,080
...but it was the doctor
who performed the surgery

57
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,680
Look at the innocent face

58
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,400
The son was adamant about
coming into the operation theatre

59
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,160
The father took him inside
just to make him happy

60
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,120
That was an operation theatre, not a
cinema theatre to take him at his will

61
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,600
It was a mistake

62
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,655
But the boy
didn't touch the patient

63
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,680
What do you want?

64
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,600
Please give him bail

65
00:07:17,168 --> 00:07:19,680
He's asking for bail
Can I give it to him, Mr. Palani?

66
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,640
No way, madam...

67
00:07:21,804 --> 00:07:24,484
He made his 14 years old son
operate a pregnant woman...

68
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:28,000
...just so that
he would create a world record

69
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,240
Take a look at this

70
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,566
The father and son duo
seem to be having fun

71
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,120
They've even uploaded
this on Facebook

72
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:37,795
Take a look

73
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,500
Doctor, why have you clicked
a picture with your phone?

74
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:45,205
I couldn't find a camera
at that time

75
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,880
They've threatened the girl
not to tell anybody

76
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,440
They've also made sure the police
do not register the complaint

77
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,641
That is why I've had to file a
Public Interest Litigation (PIL)

78
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,855
What if something untoward
had happened to her?

79
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,200
Nothing would have happened

80
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:01,958
Who operated on your husband
for his piles problem?

81
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,028
- He is humiliating me
- I've performed 150 surgeries

82
00:08:05,138 --> 00:08:07,458
I've had a 50 percent success rate

83
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,520
A 14 years old boy
has achieved something great

84
00:08:10,706 --> 00:08:13,240
He should be appreciated
We're wasting time arguing about this

85
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,175
People in Africa and the US
are calling me after hearing about his feat

86
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,600
Achievers have to cross
many hurdles only in our country

87
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,240
We don't let
another man progress

88
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,296
At this rate when will
India become a superpower?

89
00:08:22,321 --> 00:08:25,001
Are you saying
your son performed the surgery?

90
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,400
The doctor has
become a little emotional

91
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,480
He's not used to Court proceedings

92
00:08:30,745 --> 00:08:32,400
He's a little confused
I'll take care of it

93
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,175
Have you not briefed your client
about how he should speak in Court?

94
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:38,066
Let the police
complete their investigation

95
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:45,640
Please eat before you go
This is your favourite dish

96
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,440
Don't worry about anything
when you're in jail

97
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,040
I'll take care of the hospital

98
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,120
A patient complained
of throat pain yesterday

99
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,840
I performed
a tonsils surgery on him

100
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,000
- What are you saying, my dear?
- It was a success

101
00:08:56,025 --> 00:08:57,480
My darling!

102
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,960
I am scared

103
00:09:01,211 --> 00:09:03,411
'Have to tell
everthing clear-cut'

104
00:09:03,786 --> 00:09:06,586
'But all shouldn't
tell in the same way'

105
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:11,519
We'll get caught
if you get nervous

106
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,560
The police will come back
They will question you

107
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,480
You have to deny the incident
Do you understand?

108
00:09:18,675 --> 00:09:20,515
Just three days and you look dull

109
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,420
I've married you
What do you expect?

110
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,560
Don't worry, doctor
We'll get bail the next time

111
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,680
This is what you said the last time

112
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:30,375
I am doing my best

113
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,920
Please tell your husband

114
00:09:31,945 --> 00:09:35,320
- Also, can you pay me my fee?
- Fee for this?

115
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,840
I deserve this for entrusting my case
with a worthless lawyer like you

116
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,200
The astrologer was
right about Sakthi

117
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,240
You're next

118
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,029
Explain this case in detail

119
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,960
Dr. Kulandhaiswamy has made
his 14 years old son...

120
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,240
...to perform surgery
on a pregnant woman

121
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,240
Palani has turned lucky suddenly

122
00:10:02,455 --> 00:10:04,735
He was scrounging until yesterday

123
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,670
He's turned a big shot after filing
a Public Interest Litigation (PIL)

124
00:10:07,827 --> 00:10:10,107
The defence lawyer...

125
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,535
...tried impressing the judge
by offering her sweets

126
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,480
It didn't work
He couldn't win the case

127
00:10:19,175 --> 00:10:20,015
What is it?

128
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,720
- Where are you?
- I am coming

129
00:10:22,984 --> 00:10:25,384
- Why did you ask Sakthi to come?
- What's the plan?

130
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:28,249
It's been three years
since Sakthi and I fell in love

131
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:29,794
We're going to celebrate that

132
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:32,509
Happy Anniversary

133
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:35,365
I love you

134
00:10:37,492 --> 00:10:39,292
This is a school
Let's go

135
00:10:39,317 --> 00:10:40,517
Start the bike

136
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,760
- Hey, Sakthi!
- What is it?

137
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,880
She is your fiancee

138
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,560
Does she get just a rose
for your third anniversary?

139
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,120
My boyfriend got me gold ear-rings
even for our 6-month anniversary

140
00:10:52,175 --> 00:10:55,335
You won't look great
even if you wear gold ear-rings

141
00:10:55,415 --> 00:10:57,815
That's the not case with my girl
Just mind your business

142
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,760
There's no point
talking to this guy

143
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,000
Wear your helmet

144
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,200
I don't want to wear it
My hair will get ruffled

145
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:08,451
You are a lawyer,
yet you don't follow rules

146
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:21,307
I want to watch a movie,
eat at a restaurant and then go home

147
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,080
I've told mother I'll be late

148
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,660
I don't have money
to take you out for a movie

149
00:11:26,902 --> 00:11:29,622
If you want, I can take you
to a good place to eat

150
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,727
Okay

151
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,040
This is the place

152
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,160
Come

153
00:11:56,011 --> 00:11:58,451
If the stove is inside,
that makes it a big restaurant...

154
00:11:58,476 --> 00:12:00,356
...if it is outside,
it's a small restaurant

155
00:12:00,381 --> 00:12:02,381
The food is the same, come on

156
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,899
Sakthi, come here

157
00:12:06,924 --> 00:12:08,244
Let's go

158
00:12:10,932 --> 00:12:13,252
Please come
Sit down

159
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,350
What's on the menu now?

160
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:20,335
'Idly', 'dosa', 'oothapam',
'parota', 'thala curry'...

161
00:12:20,495 --> 00:12:23,455
That's a delicacy here
Let's have it

162
00:12:23,602 --> 00:12:25,240
I don't want to eat anything

163
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:26,688
Let's have juice then

164
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:28,113
Lemon juice for us

165
00:12:33,906 --> 00:12:37,506
- What happened to your case?
- One minute

166
00:12:38,713 --> 00:12:40,673
- Where are you?
- I'll call you later

167
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,551
They've called out
your case number

168
00:12:49,396 --> 00:12:50,996
What happened?

169
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,260
How long should we wait?

170
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,215
Shouldn't we get married
at least this year?

171
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,880
Just give it some more time

172
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,840
Only if I win at least one case
will I be able to face your father

173
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,960
Father doesn't have hope

174
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,640
I've been at the Court till now

175
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,320
I am doing my best

176
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,000
What more can I do?

177
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,920
Don't get angry

178
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,680
Father may not have hope
But I trust you

179
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,240
Do you see this, mother?

180
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,360
Win the case somehow

181
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,480
You're incapable of getting my father bail
but you have time to flirt with a babe

182
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,200
I'll break your jaw
Mind what you say

183
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,520
Let me see what you do?

184
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,400
Is this how you work hard
to win our case?

185
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,520
And you want your fee?

186
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
How can you blame me
for what your father did?

187
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,388
A lawyer's job is to get
the accused out on bail

188
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,600
But you are interested
only collecting your fee

189
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,560
We thought you'll argue
the case and get the bail

190
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,760
But all you can do
is offer sweets to the judge

191
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,280
You shouldn't have performed
the surgery in the first place...

192
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,070
...and on the top of it you have the gall
to upload the picture on Facebook

193
00:13:45,095 --> 00:13:46,455
I'll do whatever I want

194
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:47,808
Don't talk too much

195
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,913
That's my wish

196
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:51,841
Don't bother talking to him

197
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,880
Your family is crazy
Get lost

198
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,520
Where are you going?

199
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,040
Your husband is going
to be in jail forever

200
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,760
"When she appears,
my many emotions she stirs"

201
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,284
"It's time to break
those barriers, I come alive"

202
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:13,796
"As her lips part,
her love rains on me"

203
00:14:14,064 --> 00:14:18,344
"I am caught in a swirl,
she moves my soul"

204
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,040
"Her beauty is enchanting"

205
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,560
"She takes over your life"

206
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:46,040
"Unfolds her charm slowly,
and awakens you from a trance"

207
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,840
"You are mine,
won't you come closer?"

208
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,280
"I didn't mean it,
can't I ever be forgiven?"

209
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,120
"Turning me down right away,
is it right?"

210
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,400
"I'll become lifeless,
that will be my plight"

211
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,520
- See you, mother
- Take care

212
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,800
"You are my solace,
my soul..."

213
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,400
"Have I lost you?"

214
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:46,640
"You are my wish,
my life's colour, my rainbow..."

215
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,280
Can we start
from the beginning?

216
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,440
"Life goes on,
the clock is ticking"

217
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,000
"When will you change?"

218
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,720
"Our arguments
turn you adamant"

219
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:46,671
"Must I blame myself
for being soft on you?"

220
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:56,320
"Your glowering eyes
have put me back on course"

221
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,800
"Don't give up"

222
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:06,084
"I'll hold your hand,
that'll get me ashore"

223
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:10,189
"You are my solace,
my soul..."

224
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,320
"Have I lost you?"

225
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:24,520
"You are my wish,
my life's colour, my rainbow..."

226
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,360
"Her beauty is enchanting"

227
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,520
"She takes over your life"

228
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:42,480
"Unfolds her charm slowly,
and awakens you from a trance"

229
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,520
"Turning me down
right away, is it right?"

230
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,840
"I'll become lifeless,
that will be my plight"

231
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,280
"You are my solace,
my soul..."

232
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,560
Why this?

233
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,560
It's from my savings

234
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,760
Father has become
the public prosecutor

235
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,160
We're having a get-together
at home tomorrow

236
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,120
Wear new clothes and buy him
a new 'Samsung Galaxy S6'

237
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,600
He likes that phone

238
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,040
Gift him that and impress him

239
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,040
I know how to impress him

240
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,600
Keep this

241
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,120
You have enormous pride

242
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,840
I'll take just Rs 2,000
because you insist

243
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,920
How did I fall in love with you?

244
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,680
I heard Mr. Panchan will
become public prosecutor

245
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,120
- But he became public prosecutor
- Me too expected the same

246
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,200
But he grease the palms of
higher officials and got this post

247
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,650
Hey Sakthi

248
00:18:51,675 --> 00:18:54,155
- Hey, how is it?
- Superb

249
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,440
- I bought it
- All the best

250
00:18:56,649 --> 00:18:58,649
- How are you?
- Congratulations

251
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:02,669
My elder daughter
is engaged to be married to him

252
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,600
Sir, your second daughter's fiance

253
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,440
Congratulations, uncle

254
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,560
Thanks, son

255
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,760
The 'S6' costs Rs 30,000

256
00:19:11,785 --> 00:19:14,225
Priya gave me money
to buy an 'S6'

257
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,720
But I am smart

258
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,000
This is made in Korea
It has the same features

259
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,640
The 'S6' can accommodate only
one 'SIM' card, but this can take four

260
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,160
It's just Rs 2,000

261
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,040
Please tell Priya not to waste money
and to be responsible

262
00:19:29,065 --> 00:19:32,625
You normally give sweets
You should've stuck to that

263
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,080
He keeps that for the judges

264
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,640
That's not the only thing, can I tell you
about his other antics in Court?

265
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:43,951
- Shut up
- Let him say it

266
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:46,336
I will tell you myself

267
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,360
I appeared
for a very important case

268
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,390
The judge had
a lot of questions for me

269
00:19:50,415 --> 00:19:52,055
I got worked up
and forgot everything

270
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,440
I didn't know what to do

271
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,480
I ran away from there
saying I wanted to use the toilet

272
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,440
How is that?

273
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,880
Don't you have brains?

274
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,680
Everyone is laughing at you

275
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:15,120
You laugh along with them without even
realising they're making fun of you

276
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,800
My father doesn't respect you

277
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,480
I thought you will do something to
impress him instead this is how you behave

278
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,960
You've got used to humiliation

279
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,800
I don't know
what will bring back your pride

280
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,160
I feel terrible

281
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:42,120
I didn't take this seriously all along
because I thought you would mend your ways

282
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:48,680
Now I know that if I marry you
I will lose my self-respect and pride...

283
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,560
...and become like you

284
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,760
You're not fit to be a lawyer

285
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,480
You are unfit
for this profession

286
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,160
Where is Sakthi?

287
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,480
Last night he left to
uncle Surya's house in Chennai

288
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,360
- To Chennai?
- Yes

289
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:28,575
Why?

290
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,840
He says he will practice
only at the High Court from now

291
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,960
See you, dear
You get going

292
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,760
I am looking very lean
Do something favourable

293
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,640
- Where is the Kothandapani mansion?
- I don't know, get lost

294
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,600
Can't you watch
where you are going?

295
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,280
Do you know who she is?

296
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,400
We are mourning

297
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,680
Uncle, where are you?

298
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,360
Where are you calling from?

299
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,960
Come

300
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,200
- Uncle
- Sakthi, welcome

301
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,080
This is our home

302
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,040
Please come

303
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,400
- Who's this?
- A 'case'

304
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,036
Case?

305
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:34,666
She was here for a divorce case
She had nowhere to go

306
00:22:34,691 --> 00:22:35,811
I felt bad for her

307
00:22:35,836 --> 00:22:37,606
I decided to give her
a fresh lease of life

308
00:22:37,709 --> 00:22:40,069
- Her name is Vandarkuzhali
- That's a nice name

309
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:42,039
- Will you drink tea?
- It's okay

310
00:22:42,134 --> 00:22:44,454
He'll join us for breakfast
Get something ready

311
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,520
Have you ever tried
the food she makes?

312
00:22:46,757 --> 00:22:49,175
I haven't eaten it myself
She eats it all, just look at her

313
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,026
Our family doesn't
rate high on self-respect

314
00:22:52,051 --> 00:22:53,807
Why did you pick up
a fight and come here?

315
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:56,632
Anyway, now that you are here,
look around the city for a day or two...

316
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,119
...and then get back to Pollachi

317
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:01,304
I will go back home only
after I become a successful lawyer

318
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:07,803
Don't take him seriously
Carry on with your work

319
00:23:08,415 --> 00:23:10,215
- Welcome, Rajendra
- Surya

320
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,470
He is the house owner

321
00:23:11,495 --> 00:23:12,895
He is my relative, Sakthi

322
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,000
He is taking your house on rent
Give the keys

323
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,730
Here it is

324
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,277
Take a right
and you'll find your room

325
00:23:19,302 --> 00:23:20,982
Freshen up
and join us for breakfast

326
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,779
Hurry up before the tap runs dry

327
00:23:23,255 --> 00:23:24,055
Hello

328
00:23:24,353 --> 00:23:27,833
Hope he'll pay the rent on time

329
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,640
What's this, uncle?

330
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,960
It's pickle

331
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,088
- Why have you bought this?
- I am selling it

332
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:23,793
This is my part-time business
And it's doing well

333
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,308
This is Sakthi, my relative
He is from our hometown

334
00:24:31,452 --> 00:24:32,452
Our hometown?

335
00:24:32,563 --> 00:24:34,283
Sit down
Have something to eat

336
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,080
Sit down

337
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,160
What is the spelling of 'affidavit'?

338
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,280
Do you spell it with one 'f' or two?

339
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,508
Add a few
We can take what we want

340
00:24:45,533 --> 00:24:46,813
Sir, tell me correctly

341
00:24:46,923 --> 00:24:49,123
Affidavit

342
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,520
Who is this dude?

343
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,062
He is Vasu
He has enrolled just a week back

344
00:24:53,087 --> 00:24:54,367
He comes from a poor family

345
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,840
Join the gang

346
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,843
He is not the only one
from a poor family

347
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,200
Sit down
Will you have some tea?

348
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,520
Tea for him please!

349
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,880
- I've not found work since morning
- That's the way it will be

350
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,040
There's someone coming

351
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,496
- Do you want bail?
- No

352
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:21,761
Don't worry about the fee

353
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,080
Don't irritating me

354
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:31,040
"Is Life a lie? Is pain the only answer?
No, there is meaning to your Life"

355
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,600
Don't fight
I'll solve your problem

356
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:56,520
"Is Life a lie? Is pain the only answer?
No, there is meaning to your Life"

357
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,040
"In the fight to find truth
there is fatigue..."

358
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,880
"Be patient and you will find
what you seek"

359
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:14,713
"Won't misery leave me alone?
Won't I get my pair of wings..."

360
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:25,120
"...to soar and reach my dreams?
Or is it a waste to dream?"

361
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,520
"The heart sets out on a journey..."

362
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:36,240
"The respite in the shade is a pleasure
Is struggle Life's sole truth?"

363
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,880
'You Can Do It'

364
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:48,960
"Is Life a lie? Is pain the only answer?
No, there is meaning to your Life"

365
00:26:50,184 --> 00:26:55,464
"In the fight to find truth
there is fatigue..."

366
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:01,040
"Be patient and you will find
what you seek"

367
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,960
- Can you make way?
- Can't you see they are filling water?

368
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:36,520
"Victory is just a full stop"

369
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:42,160
"It's failures that keep you going..."

370
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:48,200
"Pain doesn't spare anyone"

371
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:53,520
"Look around and you'll notice"

372
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:59,440
"Won't misery leave me alone?
Won't I get my pair of wings..."

373
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:10,760
"...to soar and reach my dreams?
Or is it a waste to dream?"

374
00:28:10,871 --> 00:28:14,071
"The heart sets out on a journey..."

375
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:23,040
"The respite in the shade is a pleasure
Is struggle Life's sole truth?"

376
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:33,720
"Is Life a lie? Is pain the only answer?
No, there is meaning to your Life"

377
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:40,000
"In the fight to find truth
there is fatigue..."

378
00:28:40,025 --> 00:28:44,065
"Be patient and you will find
what you seek"

379
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,831
This is all I have now
I will give you the rest next month

380
00:28:46,936 --> 00:28:48,576
What's this?

381
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,000
If you do this again,
it won't be good for you

382
00:29:04,872 --> 00:29:07,352
I have just Rs 10
Can I give you the rest tomorrow?

383
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,320
It's okay

384
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,520
I am a lawyer too
I can handle your case...

385
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,640
No need man

386
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,720
Come here
There is a case

387
00:29:18,954 --> 00:29:19,794
Tell me, brother

388
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:21,619
We caught four terrorists

389
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:24,050
But when the Commissioner
spoke to the media...

390
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,313
...he said we had caught five of them

391
00:29:26,338 --> 00:29:28,138
- He blabbered, did he?
- Yes Sakthi

392
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,266
We need five people
when we appear in front of the media

393
00:29:32,315 --> 00:29:34,195
Can you act as a terrorist?

394
00:29:34,937 --> 00:29:36,537
I am a lawyer

395
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,477
Don't shout

396
00:29:37,502 --> 00:29:40,262
It's a five minute, masked appearance
in front of the media

397
00:29:40,364 --> 00:29:41,044
So?

398
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:45,353
You'll get Rs 1,000 for it

399
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,560
Here it is

400
00:29:58,211 --> 00:29:59,891
Who are you?

401
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,640
Who are you?

402
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,720
We are terrorists

403
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,560
I am just a dummy
Sit down

404
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,880
These are the five terrorists
caught by the police

405
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,560
They may wear masks but...

406
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,120
...it is impossible to mask
their unpatriotic act

407
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,536
Camera man Senthil with Sabari

408
00:30:15,654 --> 00:30:18,414
The verdict of the sensational case
of a speeding car ramming into

409
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,027
...and killing six pavement dwellers
is expected today

410
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:26,132
Defence counsel, the famous Aadhiseshan
is expected to be here any moment

411
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,320
This is Jenifer reporting for 'Sky news'

412
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,720
What's the commotion about?

413
00:30:39,815 --> 00:30:41,615
An important case is coming up
for hearing today

414
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,200
The lawyer Aadhiseshan
is to argue the case

415
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,680
I came to Chennai
with the sole aim of joining his team

416
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,440
Come

417
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,280
Good morning, sir

418
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,960
Good morning, sir

419
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:25,680
Last year Tamil Nadu alone
has registered 67, 250 cases of accidents

420
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,360
Which is crazy

421
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,360
I am not sure how many of these people
remember these accidents

422
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,880
But for the last six months...

423
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,480
...the media has made it seem like
this is the only accident

424
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,200
...that has taken place
in the country

425
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:47,320
The so called Land cruiser hit and run
case which involves Rahul Diwan

426
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:52,360
A boy from an illustrious and
well known family in Tamil Nadu...

427
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,360
A kind information your honour

428
00:31:54,454 --> 00:32:00,734
The prosecuting lawyer
has not produced any evidence so far

429
00:32:01,107 --> 00:32:03,267
Rahul Diwan's name has been
added only two days...

430
00:32:03,331 --> 00:32:05,811
...after filing the First
Information Report

431
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,640
It was never proved

432
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,480
That Rahul Diwan was there
at the sight of the accident

433
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
Never

434
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,760
Did anyone see the accident?
No one did

435
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,520
And before I'll forget, your honour

436
00:32:16,545 --> 00:32:21,265
Where is the 'Land Cruiser' that the media
has been shouting hoarse about?

437
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,400
Where is the 'Land Cruiser'?

438
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Inspector Selvam's
report clearly states...

439
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,480
...that six people have been
mowed down by a lorry

440
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,720
My client, Rahul Diwan, is the grandson of
noted industrialist Ram Diwan

441
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:41,480
...chairman of
the Diwan Group of Companies

442
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,840
A false accusation foisted on a millionaire
makes for sensational news

443
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,960
The media houses gain a lot of publicity

444
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,240
My humble request is, your honour

445
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:55,880
Sensationalising the case,
misrepresenting facts and

446
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,560
...framing my innocent client
Rahul Diwan is unfair

447
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,040
Objection, your honour

448
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,280
Rahul Diwan has been accused
of running over six people

449
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,800
I object to him being called innocent

450
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,920
Hello!

451
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:17,360
Even if you claim he killed 600 people,
you need to produce evidence

452
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,080
Do you have the evidence now?

453
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:26,360
Everyone in our country suffers
from the problem of 'mass mentality'

454
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,480
That is, if a car runs into a scooter,
the man driving the car is considered wrong

455
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,800
Each time there is a collision,
the powerful one is considered wrong

456
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,080
It is assumed
that the richer man is at fault

457
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,720
But the prosecution should
keep this in mind

458
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,720
But the prosecution cannot simply say
whatever they please the way...

459
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,960
...they do on a television programme

460
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,440
This is the Court and this is a real case
and we need evidence

461
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,600
Based on the evidence
that is produced

462
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,320
...only the judge can
pronounce the verdict

463
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,360
...and not the media or
the people sitting here

464
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,560
Please respect the court

465
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,840
That's all, your honour

466
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,600
Aadhiseshan sir, I am impressed

467
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,920
You still haven't lost your silver touch

468
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,800
Thank you, sir

469
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,080
Does the prosecution lawyer
have anything to say?

470
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,040
Your honour!

471
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:21,480
If you grant me some more time
I can put forth some more evidence...

472
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,400
How can you prolong this any further?

473
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,880
The final verdict is pending
in 3 crore cases in India

474
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,920
If I don't close this case now,
it will drag on for another 10 to 15 years

475
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,480
Even then you will ask for more time
saying there is insufficient evidence

476
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,520
- Your honour
- Please, sit down

477
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,600
Due to lack of sufficient evidence,
the Court pronounces...

478
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:47,040
Rahul Diwan innocent
and orders his release

479
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,080
Oh God!
Thank you very much

480
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,160
Sir, congrats

481
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,840
Thank you Mr Aadhiseshan

482
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,120
Congratulation

483
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,800
Sir, super

484
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,880
My name is Sakthi
and I am from Pollachi

485
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,160
Five minutes of observing you
taught me more than Law College did

486
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,280
You were fabulous

487
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,560
Can I go?

488
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,440
Do call me when you are in Pollachi

489
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,320
Make sure you get the money

490
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,400
I am waiting here

491
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,120
I have no money
Please handle him somehow

492
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,960
He will say no

493
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,920
You collect from him
I'll get it from you

494
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,160
I wanted to meet you

495
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,160
There is a role for you in
an upcoming film

496
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,040
Let's talk about it over tea

497
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,280
The rains have been heavy
this month

498
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,240
Water came up to the fifth floor
of the building

499
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,840
My house has only two floors

500
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,360
You can see I am trying to
handle the situation...let it be

501
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,840
Don't interfere
I'll take my rent from him

502
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,920
Won't he speak?

503
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,840
He's struggling to make ends meet

504
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,240
He can't pay you this month

505
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,960
He will surely give it to you
next month

506
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,760
If he doesn't pay up,
I will pay you his two month's rent

507
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,360
You owe me three month's rent yourself
and you want to stand guarantee for him

508
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,840
How will I get my rent?

509
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,160
I am talking to you and
you're just walking away

510
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,880
Will you pay my rent or not?
This is your last warning

511
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,880
If I don't get my rent this month,
see what I'll do

512
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,880
I need money too

513
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,680
- Come...come
- You don't mind me

514
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,040
Uncle

515
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,880
I don't want to trouble you
any further

516
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,120
I will go back tonight

517
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,800
Don't say that

518
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,520
You can leave tomorrow

519
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,520
Come

520
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,800
- Thank you, Mr Aadhiseshan
- Welcome, sir

521
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,000
Rahul is the future of
the Diwan family

522
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,880
Yes indeed, cheers for that

523
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,520
It is quite common
to make these mistakes at his age

524
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,400
He can't be in jail forever for this

525
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,040
Who doesn't make mistakes?

526
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,040
The government didn't make platforms
for people to sleep

527
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,080
- Ravi
- Yes dad

528
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,200
- Go and meet Ravi
- Yes, sure

529
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,640
Mr Aadhiseshan, your full
and final payment

530
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,560
- Thank you
- Thank you very much

531
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,440
My father wanted me
to settle your account in full today

532
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,200
What's wrong?
Any problem?

533
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,480
This is not the final amount
we agreed on

534
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,440
I agree

535
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,240
But the case got done
and over within six months

536
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,840
That is exactly what I am saying

537
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,240
Your son has been
acquitted in six months

538
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,720
Come on Mr Aadhiseshan

539
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,760
Ravi

540
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,480
- Make it 30 lakhs
- Okay

541
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,480
Happy?

542
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,400
When you came to me, you said...

543
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,120
...you were willing to spend
crores to win the case

544
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,480
And more over

545
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,080
And moreover, this is not just for me
I have to share it with many others

546
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,680
I think this is more than enough

547
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,720
You can want more
But you can't get greedy

548
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,000
Don't be greedy, Mr Aadhiseshan

549
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,640
- Thank you
- No mention

550
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,880
Well, sir

551
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,000
I take leave

552
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,160
- Take care of your health
- Thank you

553
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,840
Bye

554
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,040
Don't delay
Get everything out

555
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,320
Don't place it on the heroine's picture

556
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,240
What are you doing there?
Come here and take a look

557
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,800
You can get a view of the entire city

558
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,400
I can see your underwear from here
Sit down

559
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,440
I heard Sakthi is
going back to his hometown

560
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,560
He did his best
Nothing is working out

561
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,800
He is going back

562
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,880
Do you remember what Sakthi first said
when he stepped into Chennai?

563
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,080
What did he say?

564
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,920
You were shocked when he said he wanted to
establish himself as a competent lawyer?

565
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,960
I would have pulled his leg even then
I spared him because he is your relative

566
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,400
He is smart

567
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,880
He understood reality quickly
and arrived at a good decision

568
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,160
Our family is like that

569
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,760
We don't worry
about embarrassing ourselves

570
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,760
We are fine with making amends
for the mistakes made

571
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,200
A round of drinks for everyone...

572
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,160
Cheers

573
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,440
- Hello
- Hello

574
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,360
It's Priya

575
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,400
I know you weren't expecting my call

576
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,240
I thought you will come back
to Pollachi

577
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,440
Not bad! You've held your own
in Chennai for three months

578
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,640
It makes me happy
It's only now that I trust you

579
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,560
I didn't call you or
take your calls

580
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:44,160
I was scared you would come back
because you were missing me

581
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,720
I am not angry with you
I love you

582
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,640
Why are you quiet?
Are you angry with me?

583
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,840
I am not angry
I don't know how to say it

584
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,280
What, man?

585
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,360
I'll call you back

586
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,440
All right

587
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,880
'Witness missing-
Rahul Diwan Hit and Run case'

588
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,120
Have you gone crazy?

589
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,160
You've filed a PIL for re-investigating
Aadhiseshan's 'Land Cruiser' case

590
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,120
This is like walking into
a lion's den all alone

591
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,240
Why are you getting worked up?
Sit down

592
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,160
You told me you were
going back to Pollachi...

593
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,440
...but you've done this now

594
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,480
Do you know how big Aadhiseshan is?

595
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,720
I don't care who he is

596
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,280
Did you read the newspapers today?

597
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,120
They've taken off on this case

598
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,000
I came to Chennai
to achieve something big

599
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,880
I don't want to sell pickle like you
and become a worthless lawyer

600
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,200
I'll get angry if you say anything
about the pickle business

601
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,400
- Uncle
- What?

602
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,160
Everyone will support us
because we've filed this PIL

603
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,280
The entire media
is going to carry our interviews

604
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,600
I'll become a big shot

605
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,680
You have bitten off
more than you can chew

606
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,560
You're going to
regret this one day

607
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,640
I won't be there to rescue you

608
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,840
Please look at my client,
your Honour

609
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,800
I know it is a tedious task!

610
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,800
He burgled a house

611
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,320
He misbehaved with a girl
at the bus stand

612
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,320
He snatched a chain
from a woman

613
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,560
These kind of charges
would seem believable

614
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,360
Are you my lawyer or his?

615
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,080
Just wait and watch my argument

616
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,240
But, looks can be deceptive

617
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,120
My client is a young, upcoming musician
in the film industry

618
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,800
Anirudh got his break when my client
was unavailable due to health reasons

619
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:35,280
Hiphop Tamizha found fame when my client
was indisposed due to an injury in his hip

620
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:40,920
A man of hidden talents and great potential
That's my client

621
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,880
- Can you come to the point?
- I will

622
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,840
The other party has falsely accused
my client of copyright infringement

623
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,800
They've obtained a stay order prohibiting
the release of a movie he's composed music for

624
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,160
It was my client
who composed the original music

625
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,560
I object
My client is a '420'...

626
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,520
He agrees...

627
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,880
You damn it

628
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,480
He is spitting inside Court

629
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,000
I meant my client
has composed about 420 songs

630
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,760
This song is a hit as well

631
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,880
Last month, my client had planned...

632
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,200
...the audio launch at
the Chengalpattu bus stand

633
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,400
Why did he select
the Chengalpattu bus stand?

634
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,920
Just for novelty

635
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:26,360
Instead, the other party launched the audio
at the Tindivanam railway track last week

636
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,560
- What is your name?
- Google

637
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,720
What?

638
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:34,160
He's always searching for good music
That's why

639
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,320
Can you sing your composition?

640
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,080
This is a good chance
Carry on

641
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:44,160
"One punch on your face
will make your nose bleed"

642
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:50,440
"One kick to make you fall"

643
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,320
That's enough!

644
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,480
Can you sing?

645
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:01,000
"One punch on your face
will make your nose bleed"

646
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,240
That's enough

647
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,800
Case dismissed

648
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,160
- I have a doubt
- What is it?

649
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,040
The case details
are in the file you are carrying

650
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,120
Why should I carry this bundle?

651
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,640
It is just to impress the judge

652
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,600
We can create the impression
we are very busy lawyers

653
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,080
I heard Judge Dhanapal is very strict

654
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,320
You haven't seen me arguing in Court

655
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,160
Just wait and watch

656
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,360
- Sakthi
- Yes, your honour

657
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,240
Why have you filed
this Public Interest Litigation?

658
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,360
The judge has passed a good judgement

659
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,240
Why are you requesting
another enquiry?

660
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,680
Last week, a newspaper
carried a detailed article on this case

661
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:48,880
It seems the police threatened the witnesses
and also tampered with the evidence

662
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,920
People who witnessed this accident
gave interviews on TV

663
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,680
But they refused to testify in Court

664
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,840
All the big news channels
have reported this

665
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,440
It was even debated
in one of the talk-shows...

666
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,640
Stop it

667
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,720
What is your name again?

668
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,120
Sakthivel
Everyone calls me Sakthi

669
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,480
Where did you study?

670
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,800
In Coimbatore Law College

671
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:19,480
Were you not taught that media
reporting can't be used as evidence?

672
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,760
Stop jabbering

673
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,240
You've made 40 mistakes
in this 4-page application

674
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,480
You've spelt 'appeal' as 'apple'
and 'prosecution' as 'prostitution'

675
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,280
Are you making a joke of
a Public Interest Litigation?

676
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,960
Do you have any substantial evidence?

677
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,280
I will need some more time

678
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,560
Why didn't you gather evidence first?

679
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,040
Why waste our time here?

680
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,040
Sorry, your honour

681
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,120
Present your evidence
in the next hearing

682
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,800
Else, this appeal
will find its way to the bin

683
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,000
Do you understand?

684
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,680
- Aren't you leaving?
- I will...get lost

685
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,520
- Aren't you, Sakthi?
- Yes...So?

686
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,560
Aren't you the one who filed the PIL
in the Rahul Diwan case?

687
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,520
Yes! Do you also have
a problem with that?

688
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,720
I don't have a problem
I am happy

689
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,440
I am Vijay Nair from Cochin

690
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,800
I keep coming to Chennai on business

691
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:30,440
I was here on April 20,
the day the accident happened

692
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:34,200
I witnessed the accident while
returning from a late-night movie show

693
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,400
I am the only eyewitness
to this accident

694
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,680
You were silent all along
Why this sudden concern?

695
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:47,040
I did all that a passer-by
would do at that hour

696
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,920
I informed the police
and also registered a complaint

697
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,240
Do you have a copy of the complaint?

698
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,400
The police said that
they would call me if necessary

699
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,600
I waited for their call
but didn't receive any

700
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:06,600
Only then did I understand that
big shots were involved in this case

701
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,360
Huge payoffs were given
to close the case

702
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:15,520
I was very happy to read about your PIL
in the newspapers yesterday

703
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,000
Will you testify in Court?

704
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,200
I will definitely testify

705
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:23,560
The poor should get justice
I am ready to do whatever it takes

706
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,040
In an unexpected move,
a PIL has been submitted...

707
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,240
...by Advocate Sakthi to re-investigate

708
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:34,600
...the 'Hit and Run' case in which six
labourers were mowed down by a car

709
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:40,840
Judge Dhanapal has summoned
the witness Vijay Nair for the next hearing

710
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,600
Good morning, sir

711
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,760
Mr Aadhiseshan, I see you more on TV
and in newspapers than in person

712
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,440
You are always in Delhi

713
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,800
The Supreme Court takes all your time

714
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,600
Won't you make us happy by coming to
the High Court too once in a while?

715
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,560
Not like that, sir

716
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,960
I was just a little tired out

717
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,040
Nice seeing you, sir

718
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:23,120
Do you know the builders promoting
the apartment complex on OMR?

719
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,800
That builder is my brother-in-law

720
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,920
When you step in, it feels like you've
stepped into Singapore

721
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,960
Ya, its a wonderful construction

722
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,080
Your Honour!

723
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,920
Are you planning to buy
an apartment there?

724
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,480
Yes, I am looking for
a small 3-bedroom one

725
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,040
What sir? Why you
want 3-bedroom onnly?

726
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,440
You should book a villa

727
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,760
Ramajayam booked one last week

728
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,000
One minute

729
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,240
He can afford it
You know that

730
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,800
The rate they quote is very high

731
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,120
I will take care of that bit

732
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,040
Don't worry

733
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:56,320
My eyewitness, Vijay Nair is here to testify
Can you call him please?

734
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,920
Why are you in a hurry?

735
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,640
Won't you be patient?

736
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,080
What's the hurry?

737
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,320
Sorry, sir

738
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,760
Let us discuss this later

739
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,440
The young lawyer seems excited

740
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,880
Go ahead

741
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,040
My eyewitness is here to testify

742
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,240
- Which eyewitness?
- I've mentioned that in the affidavit

743
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,400
Who is Vijay Nair?

744
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,400
Me, sir

745
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,400
Come and take your stand here

746
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,400
Go on

747
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,800
What is your name?

748
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,840
Vijay Nair

749
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,680
Your affidavit says you
witnessed the accident...

750
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,480
...and that you also saw Rahul Diwan

751
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,240
Yes, I did

752
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,720
- When did the accident happen?
- April 20

753
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,560
- What time was it?
- About 1:10 to 1:15 am

754
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,440
What were you doing there
at that time?

755
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,240
I was returning to the hotel
after watching a late-night movie

756
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,040
- Which movie did you watch?
- 'I' movie, sir

757
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,520
I've submitted a copy
of the police complaint...

758
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,800
...hotel bill and the cinema ticket

759
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,480
Mr Aadhiseshan,
do you have anything to say?

760
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,360
Thank you, your honour

761
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:13,000
Let me be honest I was held up in London
at my cousin's wedding

762
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,320
I haven't read the affidavit yet

763
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,560
Can I ask for an adjournment?

764
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,120
Why not?
I can grant adjournment

765
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,680
Do you have any objection, Sakthi?

766
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,280
I have no objection
But I have a request

767
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:28,040
Can you issue an order to produce
Rahul Diwan in the next hearing?

768
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,880
The eyewitness will be able to identify him
and the case can be closed quickly

769
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,480
This is the Court, Mr Sakthi

770
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,280
It is not a concert
that will wind up in a few hours

771
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,640
On what basis
is he accusing my client?

772
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,680
I will handle everything,
Mr Aadhiseshan

773
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:48,040
Your client must be bored at home
Let him visit the Court

774
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,560
Adjournment granted

775
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,200
Do you have anything to say about
the order issued to produce Rahul Diwan?

776
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,680
We will respect the court

777
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,480
What if Vijay Nair identifies
Rahul Diwan?

778
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:05,640
Jenifer, if you ask such a silly question
He will identify you

779
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,560
You call him a witness

780
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,120
Grow up, lady

781
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,680
Come

782
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,520
Can we consider today's Court
proceedings as your first victory?

783
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,440
Definitely

784
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:20,360
If the eyewitness can identify Rahul Diwan,
everything will fall in place

785
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,000
We plan to have a programme
about this case on our channel?

786
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,800
Can you visit the studio this evening?

787
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,240
Definitely
Will you send a car to pick me up?

788
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,200
Sure

789
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,320
Can we take a picture of you?

790
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,160
Move

791
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,240
What is it, Murthy sir?

792
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,480
This is your place
You should work from here from now on

793
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,440
But, why?

794
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,640
You've taken up
such an important case

795
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,000
The Press will want to meet you

796
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,200
You should have an office

797
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,800
But, I won't be able to pay rent

798
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,400
Did I ask you for rent?

799
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:03,280
Just win this case, Ok?

800
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,120
Sit down
I will send you tea

801
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,320
Sakthi, you rock!

802
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:32,600
Do you now understand
why I've been pushing you to file a PIL?

803
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,240
Look at all the benefits

804
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,760
If you had given me a hint,
I would have set up an office in my van

805
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,080
Why is Murthy sir
going out of the way to do all this?

806
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,480
Do you see a photo there?

807
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,400
- Who is it?
- That is his daughter

808
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,640
She was raped and murdered
by a police official's son

809
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,240
Despite compelling evidence and
witnesses to prove the crime

810
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:57,280
Mr Aadhiseshan misled the Court
to dismiss the case

811
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,840
The accused
walked free in six months

812
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,240
It was all forgotten

813
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,600
Murthy has been running this shop
for the last 15 years

814
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,640
He knows every lawyer here
But no one dares to challenge Aadhiseshan

815
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,680
Since you've challenged him,
he is extending his support to you

816
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,640
Can you order a cup of tea for me?

817
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,560
First pay the balance of Rs 120

818
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,680
So big insult

819
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:37,240
A doctor on a TV programme was saying
drinking hot tea leads to impotency in men

820
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,160
Priya's sister is getting married

821
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,800
Vandarkuzhali asked me to tell you...

822
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,000
...that there is a bus to
Pollachi at 8:00 tonight

823
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:55,280
We have with us today Advocate Sakthi

824
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,320
...who will be appearing
against Mr Aadhiseshan

825
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,280
...in the 'Land Cruiser
Hit and Run' case

826
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,640
That's Sakthi on TV

827
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,160
My brother is on TV

828
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,200
Priya, come take a look

829
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,240
Mother, come quickly

830
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,760
Hurry up

831
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,120
We want justice

832
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,320
That's the reason

833
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,320
This case got the judgement

834
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,800
Why have you
filed for a re-investigation?

835
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,600
We have two eyewitnesses
who haven't testified in Court

836
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,720
Your channel has aired
programmes about the case

837
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,480
That support gives me confidence

838
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,440
I will win this case

839
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:36,640
"Her heart springs open
like the lush, blue sky..."

840
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,200
"Blushed cheeks, they tell you
she's feeling shy"

841
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:47,480
"You brush against her and
ignite the fire"

842
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:51,480
"Like a sweet fragrance,
she blends in with my breath"

843
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,200
"Like a melody,
she seeps into my ears"

844
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:01,560
"Become one with her and
play out a symphony Come on"

845
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,960
"It is twilight and
the heart is exuberating"

846
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:09,800
"When a couple comes together,
the town's celebrating"

847
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:13,480
"It is decorations galore..."

848
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:17,000
"To celebrate,
you need no reason anymore"

849
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:31,840
"It is the time to celebrate
It is time to celebrate love"

850
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,560
Come, all have arrived

851
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,040
Priya, hurry up

852
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:04,520
"Amidst the crowd,
the lovers are restless"

853
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:11,960
"Amidst the noise,
desire taunts"

854
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:18,760
"Thoughts of you
keep me awake and restless"

855
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:26,360
"Days of yearning to see you
have worn her down"

856
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:34,320
"Now that you're here,
on your shoulder she leans on"

857
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:38,000
"It is twilight and
the heart is exuberating"

858
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,000
"When a couple comes together,
the town's celebrating"

859
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:45,480
"It is decorations galore..."

860
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,080
"To celebrate,
you need no reason anymore"

861
00:56:49,160 --> 00:57:03,880
"It is the time to celebrate
It is time to celebrate love"

862
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:11,240
"It is the time to celebrate
It is time to celebrate love"

863
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,360
Come fast

864
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:25,960
"It is the time to celebrate
It is time to celebrate love"

865
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:33,080
"It is time to celebrate love"

866
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,960
I don't feel like going back

867
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,320
You carry on
I will be there on Wednesday

868
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,440
Really?

869
00:57:54,920 --> 00:58:00,040
Definitely! I want to
watch your antics in Court

870
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,160
- Sir, ice cube
- No thanks, sir

871
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,280
Here, don't worry

872
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,760
We have plenty of time
We can finish everything in a day or two

873
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,280
I can't believe this

874
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:30,080
What if the eyewitness
identifies Rahul in the next hearing?

875
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,360
How can you tell me not to worry?

876
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,960
See Mr Aadhiseshan
I'm nervous

877
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:35,720
Come on

878
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,320
Do you want to know
why I am scared this time?

879
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,680
You don't seem confident

880
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,960
No...No
Not like that

881
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,440
I am confident

882
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:51,400
To be honest, this should have been over
It got delayed because of him

883
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,320
Then, why don't you do something?

884
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,320
You can't take it so lightly

885
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:59,720
- What's that fellow's name?
- Sakthi

886
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,440
Whatever

887
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,000
Why don't we buy him with money?

888
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,920
Mr Diwan, please

889
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,200
Don't interfere in matters
that don't pertain to your domain

890
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,680
Who the hell is that Sakthi?

891
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:12,760
Who is he?

892
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,000
That's exactly my question

893
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,320
Who is the Sakthi?

894
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,600
Why are we even thinking?

895
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,960
Enough thinking of him

896
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,520
He is nobody

897
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,680
I just have to send a text message
and his life will be finished

898
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,280
Then, do it

899
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,880
That's not the issue here

900
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,920
He isn't the problem

901
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:32,600
It is the eyewitness

902
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:38,640
The honest, middle-class guy
striving to get justice for the poor

903
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,760
Because of his willingness to testify...

904
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,680
...the media is giving it
a whole lot of coverage

905
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,520
I just have to handle it

906
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,200
I'll do it

907
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,560
- Where are you?
- Have you reached?

908
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,000
I went out on some work

909
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,560
Wait, I'll be there soon

910
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,480
- Ok
- Ok

911
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,320
How come you are here now?
Is it something important?

912
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,440
Nothing

913
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,720
We haven't spoken for a while

914
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:20,200
The Court hearing is tomorrow
and I am tense

915
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:26,200
Will we be in trouble if I don't
identify Rahul Diwan tomorrow?

916
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,920
What do you mean?

917
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:29,720
I just want to know

918
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,640
What if I don't identify Rahul Diwan?

919
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,600
It's no mean task
to fight against these bigwigs

920
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:42,000
It is about getting justice for the poor
pavement dwellers killed in the accident

921
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:45,080
Justice for the poor?
Are you fighting for justice?

922
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,760
You've used me
and made a name for yourself

923
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:52,120
Forget that
I'll come to the point

924
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,440
The Diwan family
has struck a deal with me

925
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:01,040
They've offered Rs 2 crore
and you get 10 per cent of it

926
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:06,520
Whatever I say at Court tomorrow,
you have to keep quiet

927
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:08,920
Deal?

928
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,280
You are unbelievable

929
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,360
You seem to be a big fraud

930
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,840
I thought you were innocent

931
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:25,320
You are making a big mistake

932
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:29,080
The Diwan family
is worth more than Rs 500 crore

933
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,960
They are paying you a pittance
to keep you quiet

934
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,560
Take me to them
I will strike a better deal for you

935
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,520
I will get you a payment
of at least Rs 5 crore

936
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:38,320
Let us go

937
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,520
Rs 5 crore?

938
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:47,280
Yes, Aadhiseshan is panicking
because of us

939
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:50,160
Shall we ask him
for five crores?

940
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,360
Yes

941
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:02,560
You are funny and naive

942
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:09,560
Aadhiseshan planned all this and
you think he is panicking because of you

943
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,480
I did not witness the accident

944
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:22,280
My movie ticket, hotel bill and
the police complaint were all fabricated

945
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,880
I am Aadhiseshan's man

946
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:33,240
Are you shocked?

947
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:37,160
Do you think it's easy to become
this country's foremost criminal lawyer?

948
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,080
You're just a novice

949
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,080
You can't afford
to get confused this quickly

950
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,080
There is a lot more to come

951
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,880
You've become famous
with just this case

952
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,720
I heard the cafe owner has
given you office space

953
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:08,640
Listen carefully

954
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,360
Whether you take the
money or not...

955
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:14,600
...I will not identify Rahul Diwan
at Court tomorrow

956
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,440
You will lose the case anyway

957
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:20,920
But you'll get Rs 20 lakh
to stay quiet in Court

958
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,680
Deal or no deal?

959
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,120
I will settle for Rs 20 lakh

960
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,920
Good job!

961
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:33,520
Smart decision

962
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,800
Here is the advance amount
of Rs 2 lakh

963
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:41,560
We will settle the balance
after the case is dismissed

964
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,560
Okay?

965
01:03:54,880 --> 01:04:00,960
It was Bengal Govt. this's Mr Mukherjee and
the presiding judge was...Krishnan

966
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,640
Mr Aadhiseshan

967
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,640
Here is the Rs 2 crore
that you asked for

968
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:10,120
Please finish the case
and get him out of this

969
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,600
Please get him out of
this hell once and for all

970
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,840
Mr Diwan, just a minute please

971
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,280
What is it?

972
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,680
This is the final settlement
of Rs 30 lakh you paid me

973
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:31,200
I will take it from you
after I win the case

974
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:34,120
Thank you, Mr Aadhiseshan

975
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,200
Thank you

976
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:46,280
Avinash, keep it safely

977
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:47,480
Yes, sir

978
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,200
And you don't get greedy

979
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,120
You are genius, sir

980
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,440
Yes, I'm a genius

981
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,880
I decide what I am worth

982
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,320
If people think I am greedy,
I don't care

983
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,080
Because I know what I am

984
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:17,680
I come all the way to hear
you argue in Court tomorrow

985
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:21,200
But you don't turn up
at the bus stand to receive me

986
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:26,360
You think you can get away
with a sad face?

987
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:28,800
What happened?

988
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,000
I am confused

989
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:32,800
I have a long way to go

990
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:36,440
I can't become successful
like Aadhiseshan overnight

991
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,800
He is a genius

992
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:41,240
What do you mean?

993
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:44,080
All along I thought I was smart

994
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:47,280
I could get them to fall for my plan
and then become a famous lawyer

995
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,160
They shattered my plans in seconds

996
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,720
They struck a deal

997
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:53,360
I don't know if I've
gained or lost or...

998
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:57,040
...whether there is some
gain despite the loss

999
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:59,920
I don't understand
What are you saying?

1000
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,120
The case listed for tomorrow
has been dismissed today itself

1001
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,640
It's a wasted trip for you

1002
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:11,080
Vijay Nair who witnessed the accident
was set up by Aadhiseshan

1003
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:14,840
Those involved have struck a deal for
Rs 2 crore and have influenced the verdict

1004
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,600
Is it all over then?

1005
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,120
You think I am that dumb?

1006
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,720
I got a kickback of Rs 20 lakh

1007
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:25,360
Here is the advance of Rs 2 lakh

1008
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,320
I can now rightfully ask
for your hand in marriage

1009
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:32,600
Even if my father agrees,
I won't

1010
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,800
What do you mean?

1011
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,920
Were you just pretending
to be a changed man?

1012
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,000
Stop screaming
You are the reason I came to Chennai

1013
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,760
You wanted me to succeed
How can I find success here?

1014
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,200
They respect only money here

1015
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:49,800
Will you do anything for money?

1016
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,080
You haven't earned this money
as a lawyer

1017
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,760
You've earned this as a broker

1018
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:56,640
Remember that

1019
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,400
I don't care
How I earned it doesn't matter

1020
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,520
Money is valuable

1021
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,320
I was not being selfish
I did this for our sake

1022
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,240
Why have you changed?

1023
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,280
In spite of you being
penniless, I fell in...

1024
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,360
...love with you because
you were a good man

1025
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,760
But now you've become
just like anyone else

1026
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:17,680
You said you wanted to get justice
for those poor people

1027
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,000
Were you lying?

1028
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:24,840
You seem to think
you can buy everything with money

1029
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:29,040
But remember money can't
buy respect or happiness

1030
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,840
You're the biggest loser
in this deal

1031
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,040
Think about it
and you will understand

1032
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,120
He is not the one

1033
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:09,600
Doesn't your affidavit say that
you saw Rahul Diwan at the accident site?

1034
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,440
Take a good look at him
Can't you identify him?

1035
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,840
I took a good look
This is not him

1036
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:18,680
Do you know how crucial
your testimony is in this case?

1037
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,520
On what basis
did you then accuse Rahul Diwan?

1038
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:25,280
But I can't accuse an innocent man

1039
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:27,960
The photograph in the newspaper
made me think it was him

1040
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:32,280
But he looks different in person
This is not him

1041
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:36,120
Sakthi, do you wish
to state anything?

1042
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,920
I have nothing to say

1043
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:46,880
Don't know what's going on

1044
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:47,840
Silence

1045
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:52,400
What your witness is saying
favours the accused

1046
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:54,080
Don't you want to say anything?

1047
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:56,400
The case is turning
favourable for them

1048
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,160
I have nothing to say

1049
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:08,440
I will grant one more hearing

1050
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,160
Let's see what will happen

1051
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:21,400
I am very proud of you, Sakthi

1052
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:24,720
Now I can proudly say
I am your relative

1053
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,120
Give me a hug!

1054
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:29,520
You don't usually make much
money with these cases

1055
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:32,000
How did you manage
to make Rs 20 lakh?

1056
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,120
I thought you were kidding

1057
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:39,760
I am now confident you will become
a bigger lawyer than Aadhiseshan

1058
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,080
How do you know the details?

1059
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:43,920
News like this
spreads faster than a virus

1060
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,800
Everyone near the Court premises
will hear about it

1061
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,800
Do you think
I've done the right thing?

1062
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:52,040
Of course!
You are brilliant

1063
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:54,600
Everyone is lost for words

1064
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:56,960
Hello, Murthy sir

1065
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,240
Watch out!
He might ask you for a share

1066
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,560
What the hell do you
think of yourself?

1067
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:38,200
'You seem to think that
you can buy everything with money'

1068
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:42,800
'But remember that money
can't buy respect or happiness'

1069
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,720
We usually sleep here
Can you please make way for us?

1070
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:05,720
The only eyewitness to
the 'Land Cruiser Hit and Run...'

1071
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:09,680
...case shockingly testified
in favour of the accused

1072
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:15,560
We contacted the eyewitness and his
lawyer Sakthi, but they were not available

1073
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:19,240
Social activists believe that huge
payoffs seem to have been made and...

1074
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:22,120
...that money might have been
the only motive behind this PIL

1075
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:26,800
We can conclude that a rich man's car
has more value than a poor man's life

1076
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,600
That was special correspondent
Jenifer's report on the...

1077
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,680
...'Land Cruiser Hit and Run' case

1078
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:37,840
Judge Dhanapal has
adjourned the hearing indefinitely

1079
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,840
Good morning, Sakthi

1080
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,040
You've done great things

1081
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,080
Why do you look dull?

1082
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:58,200
You looked like an innocent child
in Court yesterday

1083
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:04,920
Aadhiseshan has sent you a gift

1084
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,320
Come, take a look

1085
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,160
This is for you
How is it?

1086
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,480
You've joined our team

1087
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,840
You don't have to worry anymore

1088
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:23,200
You don't have to live with
these beggars any longer

1089
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,520
Give me a second

1090
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,080
Get lost!

1091
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:30,120
Selvi, come here
Why did you go there?

1092
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,280
Don't bother about them

1093
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:35,760
Do you know to drive?

1094
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,640
Don't you know to drive?

1095
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:39,720
Go ahead and drive

1096
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,680
Even if you kill someone,
don't worry

1097
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,160
We are there for you

1098
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,880
Drive with confidence

1099
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,280
Are you crazy?

1100
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,280
Listen to me

1101
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,840
It's a new car

1102
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:13,280
Don't smash it

1103
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:17,480
I will make a call to Mr Aadhiseshan
He will handle you

1104
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:22,160
Why are you making a fuss?

1105
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,760
You should actually feel elated

1106
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:28,680
You got the opportunity to argue
against me at such a young age

1107
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,880
You know something

1108
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:37,480
Every time I win a case, the opposing lawyer
puts up my picture in his office

1109
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:39,560
They send gifts on occasions

1110
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,480
You know, his case was against to me

1111
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,720
I had bounced on me
and devoured him

1112
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:53,680
Everyone thinks you are a big lawyer
just because you argued against me

1113
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,920
You very well know your worth

1114
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,880
This money is too much for you

1115
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:59,680
That's why you've returned it

1116
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:02,840
Do you want to know what I think?

1117
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,440
When someone who loses to you
can make it big in this field

1118
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:08,760
How would life be for someone
who wins against you?

1119
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:16,360
I haven't started my arguments yet
and you are already confused

1120
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,680
Imagine your state
when I unleash my legal prowess

1121
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:23,920
You are an amateur
You can't do a thing

1122
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,680
I agree I am an amateur

1123
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:30,960
But, watch out!
You will regret your amateurish behaviour

1124
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:37,800
Emotional fool

1125
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,840
Just get out

1126
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:47,920
Oh my God!

1127
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:06,960
Intermission

1128
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:18,520
I just can't understand him

1129
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:22,400
He doesn't have sense
Why don't you try explaining it to him?

1130
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:23,760
What can I do?

1131
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:26,520
He keeps wavering

1132
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,280
I was against the idea of a PIL
But he went ahead and filed one

1133
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:33,320
I thought he can't be bribed
But he accepted a bribe

1134
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:36,800
Why the hell did he return the money?
It would have been useful for us

1135
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:39,040
Have you seen that kind of money
in your lifetime?

1136
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:41,920
You don't even have money
to buy your breakfast

1137
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:44,680
Rs 20 lakh!
I've never seen that kind of money

1138
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:49,160
You'd rather die
than have a face- off with Aadhiseshan

1139
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,040
Will you be supportive or not?

1140
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,680
I am being supportive

1141
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:57,640
I am not the Advocate General

1142
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,720
I am a lawyer who sells pickles

1143
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,440
That's all I am!

1144
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:02,960
Jenifer is the only one
who can help us

1145
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:03,720
How?

1146
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:08,840
The case findings conclude that
this is a 'Hit and Run' case with no witnesses

1147
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:12,160
But, we know this isn't the truth
That is why I suggest we meet Jenifer

1148
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:13,640
How would Jenifer know?

1149
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:17,280
Jenifer has investigated this case from day
one she knows all the cover-up work done

1150
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,520
...by Aadhiseshan and the
Diwan family in this case

1151
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,280
Moreover, Jenifer and
Aadhiseshan don't like each other

1152
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:21,960
Why?

1153
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,520
Jenifer was the best friend of cafe
owner Murthy's daughter who was murdered

1154
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,960
She wants to get back at Aadhiseshan

1155
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:33,480
She is angry
We have to convince her

1156
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,560
Give me a minute

1157
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,560
Jenifer, give me a minute

1158
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,000
Sorry Vasu
I am little busy

1159
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:43,720
Just one minute
I just need to

1160
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,680
Please don't disturb me

1161
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,200
Please listen to me

1162
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:08,960
- I don't want to meet anybody
- Please give me a minute

1163
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,800
You can do nothing to them

1164
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:34,040
Neither can I

1165
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:39,040
I investigated the case
and reported it on TV

1166
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:42,440
I thought the truth would be understood
and they would be punished

1167
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,000
Instead, they filed a
case against our news...

1168
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,800
...channel claiming our
reports were false

1169
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:49,040
Don't expect anything from me

1170
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:49,920
Sorry

1171
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:53,520
Can you share the case details with us?

1172
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:59,960
Do you want to know the true story?

1173
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:04,840
The police nabbed Rahul Diwan
within 30 minutes of the accident

1174
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:09,680
But, one hour later,
the same police dropped him home

1175
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:14,360
As soon as Aadhiseshan took up this case,
huge payoffs seem to have been made

1176
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,960
The police inspector who handled the case
was transferred

1177
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:24,280
Marimuthu, the tea-shop owner
is related to one of the victims

1178
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,880
I have no idea what happened to him
and his tea-shop

1179
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:31,640
Among the six who were killed,
there was a 2 year old baby

1180
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:43,040
In brief, he closed this just the way
he closed my friend Divya's case

1181
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:48,760
Didn't you get even one eyewitness?

1182
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,800
When officials accept bribes,
what do you think ordinary people will do?

1183
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,200
They used their money
to silence everyone

1184
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:03,520
But, there are two things that the
Court will definitely allow as evidence

1185
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:06,360
The first one
is the tea-shop owner, Marimuthu

1186
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:09,240
The second is the video footage
taken at the site of the accident

1187
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:11,240
The video footage is with the police now

1188
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,840
That footage alone
won't be considered as evidence

1189
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:16,280
Mani, the policeman who shot
the video has to testify...

1190
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:18,400
...may be

1191
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,080
It is an impossible task

1192
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:23,720
I have already tried hard

1193
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:28,560
I know a constable
His name is Guruji...

1194
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:30,320
I know the Commissioner!

1195
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:34,320
You are wasting my time

1196
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,080
Please leave

1197
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:40,480
Who is Guruji?

1198
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:41,440
Greetings to you

1199
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:44,000
I am just a constable
I don't need this kind of respect

1200
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,080
Sit down

1201
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,600
Very chilly night!
Can we begin the auction?

1202
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:50,400
Ok...ok

1203
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:56,720
The post of Assistant Commissioner
in T- Nagar is vacant

1204
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,720
That's up for auction now

1205
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:01,920
The only difficulty is that the requirement
is for an honest police officer

1206
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,320
A very difficult requirement

1207
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:07,120
But the request is from the top
and I have to obey

1208
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:09,440
The bid starts at Rs 30 lakh

1209
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,840
Rs 30 lakh?
What is special about that police station?

1210
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,240
Sir, that is one of the most
important stations in the city

1211
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:17,520
There are four liquor stores
in the neighbourhood

1212
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:19,760
You don't have to look out for
'drunken driving' offenders

1213
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,400
They will find their way to you

1214
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:24,240
They will offer plenty
You just have to fill up your pockets

1215
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:27,200
There are plenty of shops
in the neighbourhood

1216
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:31,000
Fruit vendors, flower vendors,
road-side eateries...

1217
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,920
You will get regular income
through them

1218
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,280
That is why it's priced this high

1219
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,320
The starting bid is Rs 30 lakh

1220
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,720
I bid Rs 35 lakh

1221
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:38,680
That is it

1222
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:39,960
Rs 40 lakh...

1223
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,120
Rs 45 lakh...

1224
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:47,720
Muthupandi, Guruji said
they need an honest officer

1225
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:50,160
Aren't you facing a trial
for an 'encounter' incident?

1226
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:51,720
Rs 50 lakh

1227
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,000
Here's one more specimen

1228
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:58,320
Stop glaring at me!
You came out on bail just six months back

1229
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:00,480
You're yet to be acquitted
in the 'Rape' case filed against you

1230
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:01,600
Don't provoke me

1231
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,640
We know you act as a pimp
for a lot of big shots

1232
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:08,800
Just focus on the bidding

1233
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:09,800
Rs 55 lakh...

1234
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:10,680
Rs 60 lakh...

1235
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Rs 65 lakh...

1236
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:13,040
I bid Rs 65 lakh too

1237
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:19,560
It's a tie
What should I do?

1238
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:26,040
Do you see that fellow with a potbelly?

1239
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:28,240
Wait and watch
how I get the footage from him

1240
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,000
- Hello, Guruji!
- Hello

1241
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:31,880
How are you?

1242
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,600
- Have you brought it?
- Yes

1243
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:34,480
Give it to me

1244
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:40,800
That's all?

1245
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,320
I asked you for more

1246
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:45,760
I don't run a lucrative business
to pay the entire amount

1247
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,080
I will pay the balance amount
as and when I can

1248
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,400
This is Sakthi, my nephew

1249
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:51,120
Hello

1250
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:53,000
He is going to fight his first legal battle

1251
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,080
He's relying on you...

1252
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,560
- Please
- Do one thing

1253
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,800
You've paid Rs 1 lakh

1254
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,560
I will give you a discount
of Rs 1 lakh

1255
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,720
Pay the balance in instalments

1256
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,000
You speak like a retailer

1257
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,880
- I'll take leave
- Sir...sir

1258
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:10,320
I assure you
that I will pay the balance amount

1259
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:11,240
Are you sure?

1260
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:12,520
Can I have the footage please?

1261
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:13,320
Hand it over to him

1262
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:15,480
He is Constable Mani
He shot the video

1263
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,080
You note down his phone number

1264
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,960
Your honor
May I ask what's happening here?

1265
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,240
Please

1266
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,640
I've already wasted
a lot of my time over this

1267
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:40,520
What is the connection
between the 'CD' and the case?

1268
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,760
I think Mr Aadhiseshan
hasn't watched this video carefully

1269
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:46,560
Please rewind it for him

1270
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:52,800
TN 07 BA 6665

1271
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:55,920
This car is registered
in the name of Ravi Diwan, Rahul's father

1272
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,880
I've submitted this
vehicle's insurance papers...

1273
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:59,920
...and registration certificate
for your perusal

1274
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:01,200
Turn on the light

1275
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:12,040
Constable Mani who shot this footage
on the night of the accident is my witness

1276
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,560
May I call him?

1277
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,600
I am sorry your honor
It is so funny

1278
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,760
Youngsters nowadays
acquire half-baked knowledge and

1279
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:23,960
get inspired by movies and think
they can argue competently in Court

1280
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:30,880
They want to call their witnesses like
they are inviting guests to a function

1281
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:34,000
This is the court

1282
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,520
Do you know
what an 'advance notice' means?

1283
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:41,480
It means to inform in advance

1284
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:44,840
You can't call witnesses at your will

1285
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:48,600
You have to give an 'advance notice'
to the Court and to the defence

1286
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:56,640
Only after the Judge summons the witness,
can you bring him to Court

1287
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,400
I accept my mistake

1288
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,920
But, can you please
summon my witness?

1289
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:09,000
You can bring your witness
in the next hearing

1290
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:12,080
I faced a lot of difficulties
in bringing my witness here

1291
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:14,000
Can you please summon my witness?

1292
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,400
Don't spoil my day

1293
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:19,080
Sir, please sir

1294
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:22,120
Aadhiseshan is a senior lawyer

1295
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:24,360
Why don't you listen to him?

1296
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:25,640
You have nothing to lose

1297
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:27,560
Rules have been framed
to uphold the law

1298
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,640
But they are using those rules
to hide the truth

1299
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:31,240
Please don't let that happen

1300
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:32,400
What is it?

1301
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:38,800
People like Adhiseshan use loopholes in
our legal system to turn 'brokers'

1302
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:42,400
What?

1303
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:44,720
He says you are a 'broker'

1304
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:46,840
I object, your honour

1305
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:49,840
In my entire career, no one
has ever dared to speak to me like this

1306
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:50,920
He wants me to respect him?

1307
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,200
Let the case proceedings come to an end
I will show you who I am

1308
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,600
What will you do?
Tell me

1309
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:57,080
One tight slap and your whole
lineage will lose hearing

1310
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,520
Why don't you try?

1311
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,720
How dare you both fight in my presence?

1312
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:02,360
I will say what I want

1313
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:03,880
You don't become a big shot
just because you speak in English

1314
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,120
I'll bash you up

1315
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,440
Try hitting me

1316
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,760
Why are you both fighting like rowdies?

1317
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:16,040
Tell him to keep quiet, your Honour

1318
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:23,400
I will speak like that

1319
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:25,120
Silence

1320
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:35,720
If you want to fight to arrive at a decision,
why don't you do it outside the Court?

1321
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:38,240
There is a way to conduct one's self in Court
Don't spoil that decorum

1322
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:41,000
Mr Aadhiseshan,
you are a reputed lawyer

1323
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:44,320
Even judges like me
come to you to clarify our doubts

1324
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,040
How can you behave like this?

1325
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:49,440
Sorry, I got emotional

1326
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,400
This won't happen again

1327
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,240
- You can leave
- Thank you, sir

1328
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:58,160
- I'll take leave too
- No, you stay back

1329
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:04,600
In my opinion,
you should try acting in movies

1330
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,120
What was that dialogue?

1331
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:12,160
One tight slap and your whole
lineage will lose hearing

1332
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:13,280
What a dialogue?

1333
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:17,840
This is the Court

1334
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:19,800
How will the general
public respect the court...

1335
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,520
...if lawyers themselves behave badly?

1336
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:25,520
You've just begun your career
Don't earn a bad name

1337
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:28,000
Don't lose your temper
when you argue in the Court

1338
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:30,480
I am not a peon
I am a lawyer fighting for justice

1339
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:32,640
How can you expect me to stay calm?

1340
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:34,800
This is the best dialogue of them all

1341
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,680
In the previous hearing,
your witness gave false testimony

1342
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,640
What happened to truth
and justice then?

1343
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:41,240
Why did you keep quiet?

1344
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:43,400
Was your conscience on a holiday?

1345
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:52,480
Justice may have its eyes shut
But Judges can see everything

1346
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:59,160
Sir, I may have been
shady in the past

1347
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,480
But I am fighting sincerely
for this case now

1348
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:06,640
You may not believe me,
but this is the truth

1349
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:09,880
I'll leave

1350
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,920
This is not a dialogue from any movie

1351
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:52,000
- Is evertything alright, sir?
- Yeah

1352
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:58,480
Hello Vasu

1353
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:01,000
Let's meet tomorrow morning at 10

1354
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:05,840
What do you want?

1355
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:07,720
Are you Sakthi?

1356
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:09,400
Yes

1357
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,640
Heard you raised
your voice a lot in Court

1358
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:16,720
Do you think you've become a 'Hero'
just because you were on TV?

1359
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,800
Don't you know how to behave
with important people?

1360
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:23,600
Don't take on Mr Aadhiseshan

1361
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,680
I warn you
Be careful

1362
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:31,520
Brother

1363
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,320
Will you pass on this message
to Aadhiseshan?

1364
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:52,240
Who are you?
Why are you fighting at my store?

1365
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:32,560
Don't hit him
Leave him

1366
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:37,080
Hurry up, everyone!
They are beating up Sakthi

1367
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:49,080
Who are those men?
They've beaten him up badly

1368
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:51,120
Let's take him to the hospital

1369
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:38,560
I'll take leave

1370
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:11,520
Constable Mani

1371
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:26,200
Guruji and Constable Mani's phones
are switched off

1372
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:28,200
I went looking for them
But their houses are locked

1373
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:29,120
What do we do?

1374
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:32,760
What is the point in summoning
a witness who doesn't exist?

1375
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:35,480
He brought Vijay Nair as a witness
in the last hearing

1376
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:38,160
It was a complete waste of time
Now it is Constable Mani

1377
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:42,600
I think he is doing this
for the sake of publicity

1378
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:47,920
Do you want to say anything?

1379
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:54,520
That's why I pleaded with you
to summon the witness in the last hearing

1380
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,680
But you insisted
that we follow the rules

1381
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:59,200
The witness who was supposed
to come today hasn't turned up

1382
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,320
I am sure you know
what happened to the witness

1383
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:03,400
If Mr Aadhiseshan truly believed
I was only fighting this case...

1384
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:05,880
...for the sake of publicity,
why did he send men to attack me?

1385
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,960
It doesn't stop there

1386
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,520
I get threatening phone calls
asking me to withdraw the case

1387
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:10,960
I object, your honour

1388
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:13,760
He accuses me without any evidence

1389
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:16,080
I can actually
file a case against him for this

1390
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,240
But, I feel sorry for him

1391
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:22,680
He talks too much and I knew
he will get into trouble because of that

1392
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:24,560
But jokes apart

1393
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:27,480
I can't allow something like this
to happen to someone in my legal fraternity

1394
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:30,160
You have to take stringent measures
to prevent such incidents

1395
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:33,960
I know everything
Don't pretend to be a good man

1396
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:38,520
Is this how he speaks
to a senior lawyer, your Honour?

1397
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:40,520
Don't start your fight again

1398
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:43,760
I agree with Mr Aadhiseshan

1399
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:45,640
You need a bodyguard

1400
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:47,760
I do not require one

1401
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:49,840
Being alive is more important

1402
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:08,200
Stop there

1403
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:25,040
Mr Sakthi, your witness
didn't turn up for the hearing today

1404
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:26,920
Do you think you'll win?

1405
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:30,280
I don't know whether
I'll win or lose...

1406
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:33,560
But I will fight sincerely
till the very end

1407
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:35,920
That's it

1408
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:12,720
A girl is taking her bath
and you are trying to peep

1409
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,880
Don't you have any sense?

1410
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:15,600
Don't you know
to be respectful to girls?

1411
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:18,120
Idiot! You should be whacked

1412
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:20,000
Look you and your face

1413
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:22,680
Did you eat rice or crap?

1414
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,520
Don't spare him

1415
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:27,600
We live on the pavements
because we have nowhere else to go

1416
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:30,040
If there is no safety here,
where can we go?

1417
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:33,480
Did you think we won't have any dignity
because we live on the pavement?

1418
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,200
Don't spare him

1419
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:54,400
You are already good looking
Why did you have to do this to your face?

1420
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:59,760
I am unable to face people
because of some of the things I've done

1421
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:02,520
You still have a chance

1422
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:05,680
I am confident that you will win

1423
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:09,640
I am not confident
I am scared I might lose

1424
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:14,400
After a tiff, you would
tirelessly follow me...

1425
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:17,640
...pester me and ask if we could
start again from the beginning

1426
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:21,000
Treat this case the same way
Don't let go

1427
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:22,760
Start again

1428
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:26,680
Give me a call
whenever you're feeling scared

1429
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:28,000
I'll set it right

1430
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:41,080
- Are you Mr Sakthi?
- Yes, who are you?

1431
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:43,200
I am Constable Balaraman

1432
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:47,640
Based on an order passed by Court,
I have been appointed as your bodyguard

1433
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:56,360
I've been trying to find your house
for the last 30 minutes

1434
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:57,600
I feel weak

1435
01:37:57,640 --> 01:38:00,640
Can I have some tea?

1436
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:04,040
Make him a cup of tea

1437
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:06,440
From now on, if you feel scared,
you won't need me

1438
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:08,200
He will take care of you

1439
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:09,920
I will bring him some tea

1440
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:19,160
"March forward, march ahead"

1441
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:23,160
"Your courage will be your strength"

1442
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:30,040
"Failure and its pain will chisel you"

1443
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:50,480
"The chisel strikes
and the rock chips..."

1444
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:53,760
"But the sculpture sheds no tears..."

1445
01:38:53,840 --> 01:39:01,200
"Dark clouds collide
and the downpour soaks parched hearts"

1446
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:05,320
"March forward, march ahead"

1447
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:09,120
"Your courage will be your strength"

1448
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:16,400
"Failure and its pain
will chisel you"

1449
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:20,800
"A thousand obstacles
time may throw at you"

1450
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:25,120
"A thousand delusions
may hold you back"

1451
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:31,960
"But march forward March ahead..."

1452
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:36,000
"March forward, march ahead"

1453
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:39,760
"Your courage will be your strength"

1454
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:46,840
"Failure and its pain will chisel you"

1455
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:11,720
Lawyer, sir
Come this way

1456
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:14,680
Make way for Sakthi sir

1457
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:16,160
Please carry on sir

1458
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:24,040
"From a distance,
even a shallow puddle may look deep..."

1459
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:27,800
"But with fervour when you dive in,
even the rough sea will seem favourable"

1460
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:31,800
"Stop blaming Fate, own up..."

1461
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:35,520
"Give God a break
and figure out your own life..."

1462
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:54,800
"March forward, march ahead"

1463
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:58,440
"Your courage will
be your strength"

1464
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:06,560
"Failure and its pain
will chisel you"

1465
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:09,880
March forward, march ahead

1466
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:13,920
"Your courage will
be your strength"

1467
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:21,080
"Failure and its pain
will chisel you"

1468
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:30,680
The 'Land Cruiser' that
we saw in the video...

1469
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:32,960
...footage belongs to
my client Rahul Diwan

1470
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:36,520
The 'Land Cruiser' in this
footage and the vehicle...

1471
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:38,920
...mentioned in this case
has just one connection

1472
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,680
Both vehicles were
involved in accidents...

1473
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:45,520
but they happened at
different sites on the same night...

1474
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:51,280
To prove this, can I call my witness,
Mr Nagarajan, Rahul Diwan's driver?

1475
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,240
Thank you, your honour

1476
01:41:57,080 --> 01:41:58,120
Did you notice one thing?

1477
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:00,400
The lawyer is Aadhiseshan (The five-headed snake)
and the witness is Nagarajan (King of snakes)

1478
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:01,840
They are as venomous as snakes

1479
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:04,200
- Don't worry,let's handle it
- How?

1480
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:05,920
The judge will charm these snakes

1481
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:08,080
- Sir
- Control yourself

1482
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:15,960
Can you narrate
what happened on April 20?

1483
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:21,800
I dropped Rahul Diwan at a party
and was speeding back

1484
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:25,280
- At what time?
- Between midnight 12:30 and 1:00 am

1485
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:26,400
Ok, proceed

1486
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:29,120
It was a new car and
the roads were empty

1487
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:31,240
 So I was speeding

1488
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:36,240
I lost control at a turning
and crashed into the road divider

1489
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:39,800
- What did you do then?
- I called Diwan, sir

1490
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:43,320
He yelled at me and told me
to inform the police immediately

1491
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:44,800
Note this, your honour

1492
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:46,960
What happened
at the police station?

1493
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:50,720
Insurance agents made
a video recording of the vehicle

1494
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:55,080
This is the truth about
the video footage that we watched

1495
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:58,280
I've submitted the insurance papers
and police report as evidence

1496
01:42:58,680 --> 01:43:03,200
This video footage
is no way connected to the case

1497
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:05,440
But the media and Press
have been reporting this...

1498
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:07,600
...non- stop and making
a mess of the whole thing

1499
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:09,160
That is the truth, your honor

1500
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:10,320
Thank you

1501
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:13,480
1 minute, your honor

1502
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,000
Can I ask a few questions?

1503
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:20,040
I am learning the trade from you

1504
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:25,120
How many years have
you been driving?

1505
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:26,360
15 years

1506
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:29,800
Fifteen years!
You must be an experienced driver

1507
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:32,800
You were driving an expensive car
and the roads were empty

1508
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:34,280
How did you crash it?

1509
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:38,040
I just told you that the roads
were empty and I was speeding

1510
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,840
Were you driving at a speed of
about 60 to 70 kilometres?

1511
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:46,960
That's an imported car It can touch
60 kilometres even in the first gear

1512
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:48,600
Which gear were you driving in?

1513
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:51,040
I was driving at about 150 kilometres
in the third gear

1514
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:53,080
- Did you say third gear?
- Yes

1515
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:57,120
Your witness is messing it up

1516
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:58,760
Did you coach him or not?

1517
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:01,040
This man is lying

1518
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:04,160
The 'Land Cruiser' is an automatic car
It doesn't have gears

1519
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:06,200
But he says
he was driving in third gear

1520
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:11,680
The 'Land Cruiser Hit and Run' case
has reached a sensational point

1521
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:16,080
It has been proved that the car in
the police video footage belongs to Rahul Diwan

1522
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:21,240
It has also become evident that
Rahul Diwan's driver has given false testimony

1523
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:25,960
You've dragged the case for so long
What will I tell my father?

1524
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:27,960
This lawyer is useless
Get another one

1525
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,160
I am talking, Rahul

1526
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:30,960
There is no point talking
Rahul is right

1527
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:33,520
Paaru, I am talking here
Mr Aadhisesha, why couldn't you-

1528
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,040
What's the matter?

1529
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:49,400
Finish the job

1530
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:52,960
Or tell me right now
that you won't be able to

1531
01:44:55,640 --> 01:44:57,160
I know how to get him out

1532
01:44:59,120 --> 01:45:03,040
But don't build up our hopes
and later betray us

1533
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:04,720
Then...

1534
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:14,080
You'd better be worried
about consequences

1535
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:24,440
I don't have any enemies

1536
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:27,000
Do you want to know why?

1537
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,240
Because...

1538
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:38,760
Ok, leave it
I will tell you later

1539
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:44,000
Take care
It is raining outside

1540
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:46,560
What if something
untoward happens?

1541
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:49,400
Nothing will happen to me
I am taking the bus

1542
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:54,440
You can go tomorrow

1543
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:55,960
My father will be furious

1544
01:45:56,040 --> 01:45:58,880
I will get kicked out of my job
Are you playing the fool?

1545
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,600
I am ready to play

1546
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:05,000
Leave me
I am getting late

1547
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:08,280
If you don't drop me at the bus stop
I will take an Auto

1548
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:22,040
”Love fever in the soul”

1549
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:31,200
”She feels the anxiety”

1550
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:32,960
Hello

1551
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:33,880
What are you doing?

1552
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:35,560
”Yesterday is no more”

1553
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:36,600
Busy?

1554
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:38,000
What is it, Jenifer?

1555
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:40,080
The tea- shop owner, Marimuthu
is in his house

1556
01:46:40,120 --> 01:46:42,120
You can meet him
if you come immediately

1557
01:46:42,160 --> 01:46:43,240
I am there already

1558
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:44,400
I will be there

1559
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:47,200
Sorry, Priya

1560
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:49,160
I have to meet that man first

1561
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:50,760
I'll drop you after that

1562
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:57,000
”Array of stars in my road”

1563
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:00,720
”In my desert...”

1564
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:05,280
”I see the love shadow”

1565
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:20,000
- Why isn't he here yet?
- They are here

1566
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:27,960
Marimuthu is not willing to co-operate

1567
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:33,280
Why don't you try talking to him?
I will record your conversation

1568
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:34,160
Come

1569
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:35,800
Come, Priya

1570
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:40,600
- Sir, please come out
- Who?

1571
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:42,160
What is it?

1572
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:44,760
This is Sakthi
and he is fighting your case

1573
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:45,720
Greetings, sir

1574
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:50,240
Please don't mistake me
I've come back here after a long time

1575
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:53,000
If anyone comes to know
that I have spoken to you...

1576
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:54,720
Don't be afraid
We are there for you

1577
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:57,840
You will go away after this
I will be in trouble

1578
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:59,160
They are dangerous

1579
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:01,480
Please don't ask me anything
I know nothing

1580
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:04,000
How can you say this?
They were your people

1581
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:05,880
Sir, I beg you

1582
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:07,520
I know nothing
Leave me alone

1583
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:10,720
If I testify, I won't be allowed
to lead a peaceful life

1584
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:16,640
Even if you refuse, I will somehow
find another witness for this case

1585
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:19,080
It was such a waste of my time

1586
01:48:19,120 --> 01:48:22,480
Sakthi, wait
Let's talk to him

1587
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:26,680
Won't you listen?
Stop recording

1588
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:33,360
What happened?

1589
01:48:34,360 --> 01:48:35,280
Jennifer lift her

1590
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:37,080
What happened Sakthi?
Get up

1591
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:39,360
That's the lorry

1592
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:41,080
Make note of the registration number

1593
01:48:41,120 --> 01:48:42,120
Carry her

1594
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:54,960
”Love enters the soul”

1595
01:48:56,400 --> 01:49:03,360
”Wound vanishes...”

1596
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:08,640
”Scream goes silent”

1597
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:11,000
I don't think this was an accident

1598
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:13,800
They will go to any extent
to win this case

1599
01:49:14,240 --> 01:49:17,080
Forget about the case
and go back to Pollachi

1600
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:22,560
- Vasu, do you have any sense?
- I was being honest with him

1601
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:25,360
She has just been admitted
- But we know what those men can do

1602
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:27,040
I feel sorry for Sakthi

1603
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:28,840
Sakthi, come here

1604
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:30,880
Sit down

1605
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:35,800
Don't be afraid

1606
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:37,720
She'll be perfectly alright

1607
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:41,920
Who is Priya's attender?

1608
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:46,400
Can you buy this injection?

1609
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:51,400
We will find the culprit

1610
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:53,440
Doctor?

1611
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:54,880
How is Priya?

1612
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:57,160
It's an external injury
Nothing to worry

1613
01:49:57,200 --> 01:49:58,080
She is stable

1614
01:49:58,160 --> 01:50:00,120
Let's take an MRI to
rule out anything

1615
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:09,320
”Our dreams go single
and our visions mingle”

1616
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:17,760
”Our thoughts take the path of eternity”

1617
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:24,600
”Your sparkling kindles my heart”

1618
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:32,480
”Will hold my lifetime to get your glance”

1619
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:33,760
How is Priya?

1620
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:35,800
She is all right

1621
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:38,640
She will be kept under observation
for a day and then discharged

1622
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:41,600
I warned you about Aadhiseshan

1623
01:50:41,640 --> 01:50:43,960
- Please be careful
- I will call you again

1624
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:45,960
Come

1625
01:50:49,320 --> 01:50:52,040
I am sorry

1626
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:54,040
You are an outsider

1627
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:58,200
Yet, you are fighting this case for us
at the risk of losing your life

1628
01:50:58,280 --> 01:51:01,480
I was scared for my life
and became a coward

1629
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:05,520
After seeing what happened,
I couldn't keep quiet

1630
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:07,080
That's why I'm here

1631
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:12,560
It's not safe to be here any more

1632
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:15,080
You leave for Vandavasi immediately

1633
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:33,160
You take care of Priya
I am leaving for Vandavasi

1634
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:35,240
Don't go alone
I will come along

1635
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:36,960
Be careful

1636
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:43,840
Wait here
I'll be back

1637
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:52,200
Hey! Lawyer!

1638
01:51:54,040 --> 01:51:55,960
Nothing seems to stop you

1639
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:58,480
Frisk him

1640
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:02,320
I'll kill you if you touch me

1641
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:07,080
First learn to respect the law

1642
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:09,160
You can't go to Vandavasi now

1643
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:12,080
How do you know...?

1644
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:15,760
Is it Balaraman?

1645
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,200
Did you appoint him to spy on me?

1646
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:21,840
He is a joker
I wonder how he holds that gun

1647
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:24,800
This is how I hold the gun

1648
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:27,520
Do you know who I am?

1649
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:29,040
I am the Inspector, Special Branch

1650
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:30,080
Put the gun down

1651
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:34,800
I know everything
You put your gun down first

1652
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:40,080
I just went out for 5 minutes and in that time
you point a gun at Sakthi sir!

1653
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:43,840
We've lost our reputation
because of police officers like you

1654
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:46,920
As long as I am around,
no one can harm you

1655
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,240
Leave now

1656
01:52:58,280 --> 01:53:00,520
- Start the car Quick!
- What happened?

1657
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:08,600
He has left for Vandavasi

1658
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:10,480
Leave right away
Hurry up

1659
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:12,160
Yes, sir
Let's go

1660
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:32,120
Where does Kamalakannan
from Mela Veethi Street live?

1661
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:34,800
Go down straight and take a right

1662
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:51,480
What?

1663
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:52,520
Get in quick

1664
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:55,560
Get in

1665
01:53:55,680 --> 01:54:00,240
My husband is innocent
Why are you taking him?

1666
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:03,200
- He didn't do any crime
- Get lost I say

1667
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:06,240
Listen to me, sir
He didn't do any crime

1668
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:09,200
Now what can I do?

1669
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:16,160
The highly anticipated
'Land Cruiser' case hearing is about to begin

1670
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:21,040
The final verdict on this eight month
long case is expected today

1671
01:54:21,120 --> 01:54:25,240
The high turnout of the public and media
despite the rains has resulted in elaborate...

1672
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:28,880
...security arrangements both inside
and outside the Court premises

1673
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:30,800
Will the rich win
or will the poor triumph?

1674
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:32,480
We'll know in a short while

1675
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:46,720
Sakthi, you may proceed

1676
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:52,800
Thank you, your honor

1677
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:56,560
I request permission to examine Inspector
Selvam, the officer handling this case

1678
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:59,440
I have already submitted
the relevant advance notice to the Court

1679
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:00,320
Call him

1680
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:04,360
Inspector Selvam

1681
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,760
How are you, Mr Selvam?

1682
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:15,600
I am doing fine

1683
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:17,120
Didn't you
investigate this case?

1684
01:55:17,200 --> 01:55:17,920
Yes

1685
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:21,040
Were you fair in your investigation?

1686
01:55:21,240 --> 01:55:23,040
Absolutely, where's the doubt?

1687
01:55:23,120 --> 01:55:25,880
My investigation
was honest, fair and thorough

1688
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:31,640
Can you read out the names of the six
who were killed in the accident?

1689
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:32,920
Sir

1690
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:36,000
Read it
The case is getting interesting

1691
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:40,040
Parthiban

1692
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:41,320
Mariamma

1693
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:42,520
Shanthi

1694
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:43,880
Dhanalakshmi

1695
01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:45,120
Pavanu

1696
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:46,280
Kamalakannan

1697
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:49,360
Don't laugh
at what I am going to say

1698
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:50,400
Go ahead

1699
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:52,920
These six people
come in my dreams every night

1700
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:56,480
They claim you were not
fair with this investigation

1701
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:59,400
Just because you didn't
find any witness to testify...

1702
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:01,480
...you want to take support
from the dead

1703
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:04,120
That's what I am going to do

1704
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:08,320
I am going to call a man you
caused to die, to testify in Court

1705
01:56:09,400 --> 01:56:14,840
The sixth man who they
claim was dead is alive

1706
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:23,800
Inspector Selvam was the man who
fabricated a report stating he was dead

1707
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:28,520
Silence...silence

1708
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:31,640
Kamalakannan is the most
important witness in this case

1709
01:56:31,720 --> 01:56:34,120
You must grant me permission
to question him in Court

1710
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:35,920
Hello...hello young man

1711
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,880
How many times
do I have to tell you?

1712
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:42,240
You cannot bring in a witness
without advance notice

1713
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:44,680
I know I should give
the mandatory notice

1714
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:47,560
But had I done that, my witness would have
been prevented from coming to Court

1715
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:48,840
He started again

1716
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:51,680
This is what happens
when an actor turns into a lawyer

1717
01:56:51,720 --> 01:56:54,640
This is a Court proceeding

1718
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:57,960
And not some dispute
settlement in a village

1719
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:05,280
This is my last chance
to reveal the truth

1720
01:57:05,320 --> 01:57:06,560
Will you sit down?

1721
01:57:06,640 --> 01:57:07,600
Sit down

1722
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:09,520
Don't bore us with your opinions on
what is fair and what is true

1723
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:11,200
Sit down before the judge warns you

1724
01:57:11,240 --> 01:57:12,200
Sit down I say

1725
01:57:12,280 --> 01:57:13,320
Aadhiseshan

1726
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:14,280
Sir

1727
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:15,320
Sorry

1728
01:57:25,240 --> 01:57:26,280
All right...

1729
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:29,840
Sakthi, call in your witness

1730
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:31,160
Thank you, your honour

1731
01:57:31,200 --> 01:57:32,080
Sir

1732
01:57:32,120 --> 01:57:35,520
I have granted permission
Let it be

1733
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:37,200
Ask the witness to come

1734
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:39,600
You cannot call the witness at will

1735
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:42,120
You're right
But I have granted permission

1736
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:43,400
What more do you want?

1737
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:44,800
The law doesn't allow it

1738
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:47,120
You cannot call in a witness
all of a sudden

1739
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:49,800
I know the law too

1740
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:52,120
I am the one granting permission
Let it go

1741
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:54,520
But according to the rules
of the Supreme Court

1742
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:55,840
This is wrong

1743
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:57,880
How can you grant him this permission?

1744
01:57:57,920 --> 01:57:59,240
Excuse me

1745
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:00,480
What did you just say?

1746
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:02,800
How can you grant him this permission?

1747
01:58:02,840 --> 01:58:04,080
How can I grant permission?

1748
01:58:04,120 --> 01:58:04,920
Yes, sir

1749
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,440
Mr Aadhiseshan,
this is my Court

1750
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:09,880
And not your club

1751
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:13,200
I am the final authority here

1752
01:58:13,240 --> 01:58:14,920
But it is illegal

1753
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:16,480
Mr Aadhiseshan

1754
01:58:16,600 --> 01:58:18,280
No, this is illegal

1755
01:58:21,200 --> 01:58:23,160
This is contempt of Court

1756
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:26,960
You are not allowing me
to complete what I am saying

1757
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:28,160
This is contempt of court

1758
01:58:28,240 --> 01:58:30,280
How can it be
a contempt of the court, sir?

1759
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:32,400
I am saying it's illegal

1760
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:35,160
How can you say my words
could be the contempt of the court?

1761
01:58:35,240 --> 01:58:36,480
I object this, sir

1762
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:39,280
Why are you panting?

1763
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:41,000
I only asked you to sit down

1764
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:41,880
Just sit down

1765
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:43,720
I will not sit down

1766
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:45,880
I'm ordering you to sit down

1767
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:46,800
I won't

1768
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:47,800
Sit down

1769
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:49,120
This doesn't end here

1770
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:50,680
I will take it up with the Bar Council

1771
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:52,240
I will make this a big issue

1772
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:53,840
Keep quiet

1773
01:58:56,440 --> 01:59:01,440
If you utter another word,
I don't know what I will do

1774
01:59:01,560 --> 01:59:02,640
Sit down

1775
01:59:03,960 --> 01:59:06,000
This has not happened
in my 30 years as a lawyer

1776
01:59:06,040 --> 01:59:06,840
Shut up

1777
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:08,040
And sit down

1778
01:59:08,280 --> 01:59:09,560
Sit down

1779
01:59:20,400 --> 01:59:22,400
Get me some tea

1780
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:23,880
Give some tea for him also

1781
01:59:23,960 --> 01:59:25,320
Who wants that dirty?

1782
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:26,880
He doesn't want tea

1783
01:59:30,120 --> 01:59:32,200
What were you saying, Sakthi?

1784
01:59:32,240 --> 01:59:35,160
I was requesting your permission
to present Kamalakannan as witness

1785
01:59:35,240 --> 01:59:36,640
Call Kamalakannan

1786
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:40,320
Kamalakannan

1787
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:09,320
Sir, what is your name?

1788
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:10,880
Kamalakannan

1789
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:12,880
How are you connected with this case?

1790
02:00:15,080 --> 02:00:24,080
I am one of the six people who was wrongly
counted as dead after that day's accident

1791
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:31,520
Silence

1792
02:00:32,160 --> 02:00:34,760
Can you tell us
what happened that night?

1793
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:44,120
My brother's family and I were
labourers at the construction site

1794
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:49,800
We usually slept on the pavement
on that road

1795
02:00:50,600 --> 02:00:58,280
We were to go to our hometown the next
morning to plan my sister's wedding

1796
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:05,320
As we had to leave early in the morning,
we went to bed after an early meal

1797
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:07,160
We were fast asleep

1798
02:01:07,240 --> 02:01:10,880
I heard a loud noise
in the middle of the night

1799
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:14,040
It felt like a bomb had exploded
right near my head

1800
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:16,320
I woke up with a jolt

1801
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:21,560
I saw a big car had come to a halt
on the platform we were sleeping on

1802
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:24,880
When I looked beside me...

1803
02:01:26,040 --> 02:01:34,960
I saw my wife and
others were under the wheels

1804
02:01:58,040 --> 02:02:01,200
Even my 2 year old baby was dead

1805
02:02:05,280 --> 02:02:11,000
They were lying in a pool of blood

1806
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:16,000
I didn't understand what was happening

1807
02:02:16,920 --> 02:02:18,800
I was confused

1808
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:19,920
Then...!

1809
02:02:21,160 --> 02:02:25,120
That's when a fair young man
got out of the car

1810
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:34,320
I thought he was going to help us

1811
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:39,160
But that wretched fellow
got into the car again and...

1812
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:44,880
When I opened my eyes again,
I was at the hospital

1813
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:48,280
Inspector Selvam was there to see me

1814
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:54,840
Do you recall the number of the lorry
that caused the accident?

1815
02:02:55,240 --> 02:02:56,920
That wasn't a lorry

1816
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:58,120
It was a car

1817
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:00,280
Were you dreaming?

1818
02:03:00,760 --> 02:03:03,560
That was not a car
It was a lorry

1819
02:03:03,880 --> 02:03:06,360
No, it wasn't

1820
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:09,240
I will have to deal with you
in my own way

1821
02:03:09,320 --> 02:03:11,680
The Inspector
took me to a room nearby

1822
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:13,360
Over there

1823
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:21,400
My wife and baby and my brother's family
lay dead there

1824
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:26,280
I insisted it was a car

1825
02:03:26,400 --> 02:03:30,160
He pointed the gun at me
and threatened to kill me

1826
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:34,240
Please spare me...

1827
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:35,880
Spare you?

1828
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:37,880
I will get a lot of money
if I kill you

1829
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:39,800
Do you think
I have come here to help you?

1830
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:41,840
I have some money with me

1831
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:48,640
Finally, he took the Rs 30,000
I had for my sister's wedding and...

1832
02:03:48,920 --> 02:03:55,600
...five sovereigns of gold and asked
someone to put me on a bus to Vandavasi

1833
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:16,120
If you call for Rahul Diwan,
it will help Kamalakannan identify him

1834
02:04:16,200 --> 02:04:17,560
I object, your honor

1835
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:20,160
I would like to cross-examine the witness

1836
02:04:20,200 --> 02:04:21,480
Objection over rule

1837
02:04:21,880 --> 02:04:22,720
Sir

1838
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:24,760
I'll give you a chance
Sit down

1839
02:04:26,640 --> 02:04:29,320
Come here, Rahul Diwan

1840
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:30,800
Come up in front

1841
02:04:35,160 --> 02:04:38,360
Kamalakannan, take a good
look at him and tell me

1842
02:04:38,440 --> 02:04:40,920
If he was the one driving that night

1843
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:50,760
Yes, sir

1844
02:04:51,240 --> 02:04:55,120
He was the one
driving the car that night

1845
02:05:02,240 --> 02:05:04,120
Silence

1846
02:05:08,200 --> 02:05:11,880
As the case got very interesting,
I lost track of time

1847
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,960
We'll continue the proceedings
after lunch

1848
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:15,280
Your honour

1849
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:19,320
I humbly request you to adjourn
the proceedings to another day

1850
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:22,920
I have to go to Delhi for a case
I need to argue at the Supreme Court

1851
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:26,320
You go ahead
Send one of your junior lawyers here

1852
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:29,600
I cannot adjourn the case
The verdict will be given today

1853
02:05:29,960 --> 02:05:31,360
I will be back after lunch

1854
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:37,040
Hey

1855
02:05:37,480 --> 02:05:38,320
Sir

1856
02:05:38,920 --> 02:05:41,120
That man you brought from Vandavasi,
how did he come to Court?

1857
02:05:41,160 --> 02:05:42,360
He is right here

1858
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:43,720
Call him

1859
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:46,840
Come here, man

1860
02:05:47,960 --> 02:05:49,000
Here he is

1861
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:51,800
He is not the one

1862
02:05:52,920 --> 02:05:55,280
- Why did you lie?
- You can't harm me now

1863
02:05:55,320 --> 02:05:57,240
I showed you the wrong guy on purpose

1864
02:05:57,320 --> 02:06:00,760
Kamalakannan would have testified
in Court by now

1865
02:06:01,120 --> 02:06:02,600
Get lost

1866
02:06:02,840 --> 02:06:03,920
Hey

1867
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:04,960
Sir

1868
02:06:05,560 --> 02:06:07,560
Answer three of my questions

1869
02:06:08,040 --> 02:06:10,560
- Is his name correct?
- Yes

1870
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:13,400
- Is he from Vandavasi?
- Yes

1871
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:15,360
Is he speaking the truth?

1872
02:06:15,880 --> 02:06:16,920
Yes

1873
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:19,480
You spared him
for a small sum of Rs 30,000?

1874
02:06:19,560 --> 02:06:20,720
Damn!

1875
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:22,040
Shut up

1876
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:25,520
Your life is going to be ruined

1877
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:28,160
Save me somehow

1878
02:06:29,240 --> 02:06:31,200
I don't want to see your face ever

1879
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:32,360
Get lost

1880
02:06:32,440 --> 02:06:33,480
Sir

1881
02:06:33,560 --> 02:06:35,040
Sir...sir

1882
02:06:39,120 --> 02:06:44,280
Mr Aadhiseshan, you may sum up
before I give the verdict

1883
02:06:44,840 --> 02:06:46,680
Thank you, your honor

1884
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:50,760
I first wish to thank Mr Sakthi

1885
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:53,680
For filing this Public
Interest Litigation

1886
02:06:53,920 --> 02:06:59,080
Because of that, the case could be re-investigated
revealing new facts and new evidence

1887
02:06:59,200 --> 02:07:00,480
Thank you, Sakthi

1888
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:07,480
In spite of substantial evidence, my client
Rahul Diwan is still not proven guilty

1889
02:07:10,120 --> 02:07:12,760
Before I present my summation

1890
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:17,160
I have to tell you
what's worried me for a long time

1891
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:21,280
Just look at every face here

1892
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:23,240
Just look at their faces

1893
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:28,720
I can see restlessness and impatience

1894
02:07:29,080 --> 02:07:33,040
That's because even before the verdict...

1895
02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:40,440
...they've already made up their mind
that Rahul Diwan is guilty

1896
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:44,280
Their desire is
to see him put in jail

1897
02:07:44,480 --> 02:07:48,600
No one here has the
ability to think...

1898
02:07:48,680 --> 02:07:52,280
...rationally about what
happened that night

1899
02:07:54,240 --> 02:07:57,640
What actually happened that night?

1900
02:07:58,360 --> 02:08:00,480
A lot of confusions, your honor

1901
02:08:01,080 --> 02:08:08,000
The police report states that the accident
being disputed was caused by a lorry

1902
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:12,560
But the prosecution lawyer and
everyone else claim that...

1903
02:08:12,640 --> 02:08:15,720
...the accident
was caused by a 'Land Cruiser'

1904
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:21,680
The police report clearly states
that there were six victims

1905
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:24,080
But the prosecution claims
that it was only five

1906
02:08:24,760 --> 02:08:31,640
A man, reportedly dead, suddenly appears
as witness and we don't question a thing

1907
02:08:31,720 --> 02:08:33,240
Is it a joke?

1908
02:08:35,400 --> 02:08:37,040
Your honor

1909
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:42,560
The reason for this is
the carelessness of the Police department

1910
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:44,960
And I'm behalf on the honorable court

1911
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:50,720
I strongly recommend the strong punishment
to be given to this Inspector Selvam

1912
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:52,840
The Police department is
losing its reputation...

1913
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:54,680
...because of Police
officers like him

1914
02:08:54,720 --> 02:08:58,600
Now I realise why the common man
has no trust in the police

1915
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:03,160
They make a mockery of investigation

1916
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:06,240
He should be awarded
severe punishment for this

1917
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:08,320
The Police department should realise...

1918
02:09:08,360 --> 02:09:12,520
What is the shame they've brought on
the department because of their negligence

1919
02:09:15,640 --> 02:09:17,320
Emotion society, your honor

1920
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:21,360
Before giving your verdict...

1921
02:09:22,280 --> 02:09:25,240
Please consider the nature
of the evidence produced

1922
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:27,760
That forms the basis for this case

1923
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,600
The first evidence
is a careless police report

1924
02:09:32,040 --> 02:09:34,720
The second is a witness
who has risen from the dead

1925
02:09:35,120 --> 02:09:37,160
Two flimsy reasons

1926
02:09:37,960 --> 02:09:41,120
Based on such flimsy evidence...

1927
02:09:41,280 --> 02:09:47,920
...will the Court be able to give a verdict
that my client is guilty?

1928
02:09:48,200 --> 02:09:50,800
If such a verdict is given...

1929
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:53,480
I would have to say this
is a 'Black day' for...

1930
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:55,360
...the profession that I
respect and revere

1931
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:56,760
It's a Black day

1932
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:00,040
Well, your honour

1933
02:10:00,280 --> 02:10:03,000
I have something to say

1934
02:10:03,960 --> 02:10:07,600
Before that I express my heartfelt
condolences to the six people...

1935
02:10:07,680 --> 02:10:14,080
...sorry, five people
who lost their lives

1936
02:10:15,320 --> 02:10:18,040
I have something to say
and I say it with a heavy heart

1937
02:10:19,280 --> 02:10:24,520
If you sleep on a platform,
accidents are inevitable

1938
02:10:26,080 --> 02:10:27,120
That is a platform

1939
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:29,480
Not your bed room, damn it

1940
02:10:29,720 --> 02:10:30,720
Mind your word

1941
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:32,400
Sorry for the language, your honour

1942
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:34,720
Just my emotion

1943
02:10:36,360 --> 02:10:37,720
So your honour

1944
02:10:37,800 --> 02:10:41,160
It's all in your hands now

1945
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:44,960
With due respects to you
and to your experience

1946
02:10:45,320 --> 02:10:47,360
I leave it to your wisdom

1947
02:10:47,440 --> 02:10:49,440
And your fair sense of judgement

1948
02:10:50,040 --> 02:10:51,480
Thank you, your honour

1949
02:10:57,280 --> 02:10:59,760
Silence...silence

1950
02:11:04,040 --> 02:11:06,000
Sakthi, your submission

1951
02:11:10,360 --> 02:11:11,640
Thank you, your honour

1952
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:25,760
For the first time
I accept what Mr Aadhiseshan has said

1953
02:11:28,480 --> 02:11:35,760
If you sleep on a platform,
accidents are inevitable

1954
02:11:37,640 --> 02:11:42,640
I want to ask him just one thing

1955
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:45,680
Actually, I want to ask
each one of you here

1956
02:11:45,720 --> 02:11:47,720
Including you, your Honour

1957
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:53,600
Who are these pavement dwellers?

1958
02:11:54,640 --> 02:11:56,200
Where have they come from?

1959
02:11:57,360 --> 02:11:58,920
They don't have a place to live

1960
02:11:58,960 --> 02:12:02,680
Neither do they have food,
a job nor money

1961
02:12:04,080 --> 02:12:06,960
Why do these people leave their hometown
and come here to live on platforms...

1962
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:08,920
...and dirty our city?

1963
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:11,360
Have you ever given it a thought?

1964
02:12:12,960 --> 02:12:14,560
Do you know who they are?

1965
02:12:15,600 --> 02:12:18,840
They are farmers
who couldn't pay their debts...

1966
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:21,760
...old people
chased out by their family

1967
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:23,560
They are orphans

1968
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:26,880
No one chooses to live on pavements

1969
02:12:27,880 --> 02:12:31,080
It maybe all right
if they don't get food or water

1970
02:12:31,120 --> 02:12:33,680
But the one thing
that they can't be denied is Justice

1971
02:12:33,720 --> 02:12:35,560
Neither Mr Aadhiseshan,
nor your Lordship...

1972
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:37,080
...or this Court can deny
this right to Justice

1973
02:12:37,120 --> 02:12:40,560
Because it has been granted by
the Constitution of India...

1974
02:12:45,800 --> 02:12:50,320
When a poor man gets into a legal dispute
that is the end of his life

1975
02:12:50,360 --> 02:12:53,920
Hearings and adjournments go on and on

1976
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,720
The case never comes to an end

1977
02:12:55,800 --> 02:13:00,240
We build his hopes and
prolong the case

1978
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:04,320
At the end of it,
he still does not get justice

1979
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:14,560
Whereas, Rahul Diwan, a rich boy
in a drunken state who over speeds...

1980
02:13:14,640 --> 02:13:17,960
...and kills five pavement dwellers
is considered innocent

1981
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:20,960
Just look at him
He pretends to be a good man

1982
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:24,320
Mr Aadhiseshan calls this a joke

1983
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:26,960
I'll tell you what the bigger joke is

1984
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:29,240
This case has been going on for
the last eight months

1985
02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:30,880
Within which Mr Aadhiseshan
has proven that the vehicle that...

1986
02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:32,640
...caused the accident was
a lorry and not a car

1987
02:13:32,680 --> 02:13:35,560
If we give it six more months, he will
prove that a train caused the accident

1988
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:37,120
He is quite capable
of saying that the...

1989
02:13:37,160 --> 02:13:39,080
...witness is Kamal Haasan
and not Kamalakannan

1990
02:13:39,120 --> 02:13:41,840
Without substantial evidence,
you will accept what he is saying

1991
02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:43,680
This will be the biggest joke

1992
02:13:47,360 --> 02:13:51,960
Mr Aadhiseshan, you said
it is not right to sleep on a platform

1993
02:13:52,160 --> 02:13:55,560
Is it right to drive a car on the platform?

1994
02:13:57,680 --> 02:13:59,360
Don't try teaching me the rules

1995
02:13:59,600 --> 02:14:02,280
Sir, there is signage behind you
that reads 'Truth will prevail'

1996
02:14:02,320 --> 02:14:04,440
Please replace that with
'Justice is for sale'

1997
02:14:04,480 --> 02:14:05,200
Sakthi

1998
02:14:05,240 --> 02:14:05,960
I apologise

1999
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:09,120
The feeling that the rich can get away
with anything by bribing the system...

2000
02:14:09,200 --> 02:14:10,960
...is deep-rooted in the common man

2001
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:13,760
Don't get angry
Prove that it is not so

2002
02:14:14,200 --> 02:14:16,800
Throw this Rahul Diwan in jail

2003
02:14:16,880 --> 02:14:20,000
Apart from the accident,
he has also attempted murder

2004
02:14:20,040 --> 02:14:21,160
Charge him for both

2005
02:14:21,240 --> 02:14:24,160
Only then will the common man believe
that 'Truth will prevail'

2006
02:14:31,720 --> 02:14:34,960
I am not asking you to
pity the pavement dwellers

2007
02:14:36,160 --> 02:14:38,320
I am only fighting
for their right to justice

2008
02:14:41,160 --> 02:14:43,920
They are human beings too

2009
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:51,600
Please grant them justice

2010
02:15:03,720 --> 02:15:05,560
That's all, your Honour

2011
02:15:18,520 --> 02:15:21,120
Silence...silence

2012
02:15:22,160 --> 02:15:23,600
Silence

2013
02:15:24,920 --> 02:15:27,400
That was superb speech!

2014
02:15:27,440 --> 02:15:32,160
Don't you agree, Mr Aadhiseshan?
Sakthi's submission was very good

2015
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:37,000
There are two important things
to be noted in this case

2016
02:15:39,480 --> 02:15:42,800
The Police department
hasn't conducted a fair investigation

2017
02:15:42,880 --> 02:15:46,520
I hereby order the Tamil Nadu Police
to suspend Inspector Selvam...

2018
02:15:46,600 --> 02:15:48,600
...and conduct an Inquiry

2019
02:15:52,760 --> 02:15:58,720
The next one is that someone
has tampered with all the evidence

2020
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:01,760
Mr Aadhiseshan,
you have to agree

2021
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:02,720
No, sir

2022
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:04,680
If your client is innocent,
you don't have to...

2023
02:16:04,760 --> 02:16:07,320
...try so hard to tamper
with all the evidence

2024
02:16:08,440 --> 02:16:13,160
Everyone knows who caused this accident

2025
02:16:13,440 --> 02:16:17,560
But being a Judge I can't give my verdict
without substantial evidence

2026
02:16:17,680 --> 02:16:21,320
To give a fair verdict,
I need substantial evidence

2027
02:16:22,680 --> 02:16:24,640
But there was no evidence

2028
02:16:25,720 --> 02:16:29,160
I knew who the guilty person was
on the very first day of the hearing

2029
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:35,720
But to award a punishment,
I need evidence

2030
02:16:35,880 --> 02:16:38,280
I was patiently waiting
for the evidence

2031
02:16:38,360 --> 02:16:40,480
But there was nothing

2032
02:16:40,520 --> 02:16:42,440
There were only bundles of paper

2033
02:16:42,520 --> 02:16:49,640
But there wasn't a single paper that
could be treated as evidence

2034
02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:52,320
The witness either won't
turn up for the hearing

2035
02:16:52,360 --> 02:16:54,920
Or will give a false testimony

2036
02:16:54,960 --> 02:16:56,640
I can do nothing about it

2037
02:16:56,680 --> 02:16:59,160
The guilty person can
walk away scot-free

2038
02:16:59,440 --> 02:17:01,360
This is the story till now

2039
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:08,400
But today...

2040
02:17:13,600 --> 02:17:15,160
It will be different today

2041
02:17:19,480 --> 02:17:23,120
PIL number 48693

2042
02:17:23,600 --> 02:17:26,640
The trail, state vs Rahul Diwan

2043
02:17:26,760 --> 02:17:29,600
This court finds Rahul Diwan guilty

2044
02:17:30,800 --> 02:17:34,840
And sentence him
under section 3048

2045
02:17:34,880 --> 02:17:36,120
And 307

2046
02:17:36,200 --> 02:17:37,880
Of Indian penal code

2047
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,360
7 years for hit and run

2048
02:17:40,440 --> 02:17:42,880
7 years for attempt of murder

2049
02:17:42,920 --> 02:17:44,120
Total 14 years

2050
02:17:55,520 --> 02:17:57,400
Silence...silence

2051
02:17:57,440 --> 02:17:58,560
Silence

2052
02:17:59,560 --> 02:18:00,800
Your honour

2053
02:18:00,880 --> 02:18:02,240
This is bizarre

2054
02:18:03,360 --> 02:18:05,480
How can you give this as a verdict?

2055
02:18:05,960 --> 02:18:09,320
I am sure you know that the Supreme Court
will dismiss this case immediately

2056
02:18:09,400 --> 02:18:12,040
I will go to the Supreme Court

2057
02:18:12,120 --> 02:18:16,520
You can do what you want,
go where you wish to

2058
02:18:16,600 --> 02:18:17,960
You can go to any Court

2059
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:19,920
Don't stop with the Supreme Court

2060
02:18:19,960 --> 02:18:21,400
Go meet the President if you want

2061
02:18:21,440 --> 02:18:23,400
You can go anywhere at your convenience

2062
02:18:23,440 --> 02:18:27,000
But today, Rahul Diwan goes to jail

2063
02:18:27,080 --> 02:18:28,360
You may sit down

2064
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:31,240
The details of
the judgement will be forward

2065
02:18:31,960 --> 02:18:33,480
The court is adjourned

2066
02:18:33,960 --> 02:18:35,680
Congratulations

2067
02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:36,880
Sorry, sir

2068
02:18:36,920 --> 02:18:38,920
I don't know what I am doing
in my excitement

2069
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:40,480
Sakthi, congrats

2070
02:18:40,520 --> 02:18:41,920
Sakthi, you won

2071
02:18:43,880 --> 02:18:45,520
I'm really very happy, Sakthi

2072
02:18:48,160 --> 02:18:49,440
Dad...dad

2073
02:18:49,480 --> 02:18:50,720
- Radhul
- Mom

2074
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:14,760
'Dedicated to the homeless
pavement dwellers'
