454
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:56,152
And here generally
the man comes only twice.

455
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:59,551
Once on the first day and second
time after departure from here.

456
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:02,153
Right now don't worry
about getting sacked..

457
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:04,695
Now you think for going inside.

458
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:17,175
Both hands up.

459
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:23,646
How are you? Everything is fine?

460
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,117
Why are you so sullen?

461
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:30,653
The boss is very mean.

462
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:34,990
If you get stuck somewhere,
just crack a joke!

463
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,529
Do you know any jokes?

464
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:39,596

Okay, hear me out..

Um, first, just loosen up a bit.

472
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:06,925
Your body language is too stiff.

473
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:09,722
Now it's all good!

474
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:12,028
Just tell him this joke..

475
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:14,867
A secretary goes
to her boss and says..

476
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:16,768
"Can I borrow five hundred rupees,
I shall give 'it' to you tomorrow."

477
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,362
The boss replies,
"You can take one thousand rupees..

478
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:19,133

He is a fun-loving guy!

502
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:30,007
He told me a joke yesterday.

504
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,913

Sir one secretary goes to the sir..

508
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:49,787
..and ask for five hundred
rupees and says tomorrow she will give.

509
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:52,527
The sir said that take one
thousand and give me today only.

510
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:11,649
Correct.

511
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:14,881
O.K. go I will tell you later on.

512
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:16,489

Key locker number 8.

515
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:51,521
Come on young man,
you are taking too long!

516
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:56,691
There is gun and you come to wear it.

517
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:14,811
You have to collect the box first.

518
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:22,148
To the client and he keep whatever he
wants and hen send to the desired place.

519
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,551
To the bank, an office, anywhere!

520
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,662
One key is with client
and one in the command.

521
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:33,293
We are not shown the even key also.

522
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:35,663
It's pretty obvious.

523
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:39,631
the person who has both the
box and the key, is the lucky man!

524
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:46,476
If the box is some where theft then.

525
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:48,148
Stolen?

526
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:50,711
If there is theft then..

527
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:53,584
all the key are called in the
command till the box is not recovered.

528
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:59,188
Since when the company started
there are only two theft incident.

529
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:27,521
There is no much theft
but the danger is always there.

530
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:29,355
That's why we're here.

531
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:43,769
Deepak, hold, hold it.

532
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:46,538
Deepak, hold..
- Sir..

533
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:47,637
Don't come down.

534
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:49,536
There is some moment.
- Alright Sir.

535
00:52:57,707 --> 00:52:58,845
Come everything is clear now.

536
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:14,528
If any one break the box
and take out forcibly then.

537
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:18,865
You want to take out?

538
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:21,838
No I am asking only for the information.

539
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:26,979
Don't try also. Because there
is a safety device in the box.

540
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:28,948
What?

541
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:32,019
A type of automatic bomb.

542
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:34,778
If you will try to force
for open then it will blast.

543
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:40,289
The box is destroyed. You are dead.
What's the point!

544
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,558
Some time its happen?

545
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:52,699
My earlier partner...Vakar.

546
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:55,609
Sir! Sir!

547
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:56,570
Yes

548
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,204
Thank you, Sir.

549
00:53:58,635 --> 00:53:59,204
Why?

550
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:00,713
Sir you did lot for me.

551
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:02,979
Close the button.

552
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:04,040
Yes Sir!

553
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:21,595
There were two boxes.

554
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:26,099
In trying to open one box,
two men lost their lives.

555
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:28,937
They were going crazy!

556
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,476
Screaming, "The keys?".
"Give the keys"!

557
00:54:32,535 --> 00:54:33,605
Tell us!

558
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:36,681
The key is not shown to us.

559
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:38,284
- We don't have the keys!
- Tell us!

560
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:39,945
The key is not shown to us.

561
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,316
- Tell us!
- We don't have the keys!

562
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:42,948
We were in a lot of trouble!

563
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:44,955
We had seen the faces of these men.

564
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,898
I don't fear dying.

565
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:05,840
I fear informing the family
members of those who have died.

566
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:10,178
A pathetic rule of ASB,

567
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:14,188
the partner must do the duty of
informing the family of the deceased!

568
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:16,919
I had to collect his belongings.

569
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:23,359
His wallet, watch,
rings and go to his house..

570
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:26,764
Inform his family members that,
that's it!

571
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,492
He is dead.

572
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:32,798
in trying to save a few
millions of some rich man!

573
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:38,373
There is just one thing that
saves you, efficient training.

574
00:55:43,406 --> 00:55:44,214
What happen.

575
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:46,712
You will take that much time.

576
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,082
If any one takes box
then you will not fire.

577
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:59,099
Just shoot in the dark perhaps
one bullet mightjust hit him!

578
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:12,810
All these birds are
coming from far away place.

579
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:18,784
New city and that is why
they are staying together always.

580
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:23,123
If they will stay together
then they are safe.

581
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:28,591
Otherwise they will be killed.

582
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,342
Come..

583
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:46,871
Mahi you are my good girl.

584
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:52,048
See all the children are
playing and you also like to play.

585
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:53,416
Let's go inside.

586
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,455
No I don't want.

587
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:58,886
What mamma has said you that..

588
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:01,761
..if mama will go to
work then bring toys for you.

589
00:57:03,486 --> 00:57:08,799
"There are so many faces,"

590
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:13,170
..but everyone is alone."

591
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:19,376
"Your city is awake day and night..

592
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:23,644
..unnecessarily."

593
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:29,720
"In the funfair of faces,"

594
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:35,126
..let me meet someone I know."

595
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:37,665
"Let me sleep."

596
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:43,029
"Let me weave dreams."

597
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:49,902
"Let me sleep."

598
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:54,673
"Let me weave dreams."

599
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:21,240
Sir can I take some parcel.

600
00:58:22,265 --> 00:58:23,300
Why you don't like it?

601
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:26,645
It is good and I was thinking
to take this for house people.

602
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:30,343
You eat first and while
going take the parcel also.

603
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:37,550
Today I will go early
as I had some work.

604
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:41,351
You go on time and while
going give my sign also.

605
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:43,856
Shall I sign for you?

606
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:50,001
Yes. I am running
one side business also.

607
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:52,737
You are having some business also?

608
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,877
Side business means...

609
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:01,615
I meant, I like this girl..

610
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,283
..and I am meeting her.

611
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:08,950
If I go see her after work,
my wife will find out..

612
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,282
..and she will create a ruckus!

613
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:12,954
I can meet her only
during my work hours.

614
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:16,923
A few years down your marriage,
you'll figure this out too.

615
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:19,796
The boys in the company
know about it.

616
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:22,762
The news has never reached my wife.

617
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,771
So you will sign
in proxy for me, right?

618
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:29,004
There is no problem?

619
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,438
When we are working together
then we have to help each other.

620
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:37,848
Tomorrow you will have
to go early then I will sign.

621
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:41,353
There is sign.

622
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:46,818
Well done, brother, eh!

623
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:50,156
What happen.

624
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,724
Just one week has passed..

625
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:56,266
..and you are signing
on behalf of the supervisor.

626
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,073
He said to me.

627
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:01,604
No problem come.

628
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:03,407
Where?

629
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:04,770
You come.

630
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:06,406
Where to?

631
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:33,165
Where is Vishnu sir?

632
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:34,902
I will meet you. First meet her.

633
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:40,414
"Why do you roam here and there?"

634
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:45,848
"Which alley and which world?"

635
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:51,388
"Oh boy, the one you are
looking for, isn't here."

636
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:56,823
"He isn't here."

637
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:02,827
"Why do you roam here and there?"

638
01:01:02,892 --> 01:01:08,035
"Which alley and which world?"

639
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:09,542
How are you Deepakji?
- O.K.

640
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,711
What you will take?
- No sir.

641
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,546
What you don't drink?

642
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:17,409
I have left drinking.

643
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:18,649
What?

644
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:20,450
This wine sir.

645
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:23,413
This is not wine.
This is holy water!

646
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:24,748
Sid!

647
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:28,718
"Why do you roam?"

648
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:31,325
- Two! What will you have?
- Scotch. Sir, Scotch.

649
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:32,263
Scotch.

650
01:01:32,555 --> 01:01:33,659
Just ask for water for me.

651
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:35,096
Here the water is not available.

652
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:37,938
Who asks for water
in a place like heaven?

653
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:41,702
You just get holy water in this heaven.
- "Where are you going?"

654
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:44,577
"Why are you going?"

655
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:48,438
"What kind of a passion is this?"

656
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:53,147
"Wait for two minutes..

657
01:01:53,242 --> 01:02:00,091
..wait and be at peace
for some time."

658
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:07,092
"No one can go against destiny."

659
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:12,265
"How can you go against it?"
- One, two, three!

660
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:17,806
"Why do you roam here and there?"

661
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:23,910
"Which alley and which world?"

662
01:02:24,006 --> 01:02:28,785
"Oh boy, the one you are
looking for, isn't here."

663
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:34,523
"He isn't here."

664
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:40,229
"Why do you roam?"

665
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:43,993
"Why do you roam?"

666
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:18,562
"The one who comes in the world
has to leave it one day."

667
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:22,437
"The one who lives for free..

668
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:29,882
..will have to pay the debt
one day."

669
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:40,257
"O traveller, listen to me.
This world is not yours."

670
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:47,491
"Why do you roam here and there?"

671
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:53,098
"Which alley and which world?"

672
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:58,305
"Oh boy, the one you are
looking for, isn't here."

673
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:03,844
"He isn't here."

674
01:04:04,106 --> 01:04:09,715
"Why do you roam?"

675
01:04:09,812 --> 01:04:13,316
"Why do you roam?"

676
01:05:02,765 --> 01:05:05,974
Rakhee. Rakhee.

677
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:09,675
Stand up, Rakhee.

678
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:16,245
Stand up.

679
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:21,159
You came to drink.

680
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,194
Stand up.

681
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,398
You dance for me.

682
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,404
You dance for me.

683
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,411
You dance for me.

684
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:46,819
You dance for me.

685
01:05:47,543 --> 01:05:48,385
Sleep now.

686
01:05:50,012 --> 01:05:50,922
Sleep now.

687
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,323
There you are dancing in front of people.

688
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:56,826
Dance for me.
- Mahi is sleeping.

689
01:05:58,487 --> 01:05:59,761
Mahi is sleeping.

690
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:02,433
- Mahi, wake up.
- Stand back!

691
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:04,934
You dance for me.

692
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:06,898
Dance.

693
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:13,912
- Why do you feel ashamed?
- Mahi is sleeping.

694
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:15,949
You dance in front of everyone,
don't you?

695
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:20,711
You dance for me.

696
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:21,780
Mahi is sleeping.

697
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:23,118
You dance for me.

698
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,716
Mahi is sleeping.

699
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:32,559
This is money. You take and dance.

700
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:35,596
You dance for me.

701
01:06:40,062 --> 01:06:41,006
You dance in front of me.

702
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:45,178
Mahi, mommy will dance for you..
- She is sleeping.

703
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:47,277
She is sleeping and don't wake up her.

704
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:17,772
lam dancing not with my own desire.

705
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:22,573
What you said while
bringing in the city..

706
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:27,520
..that everything will be fine.
What happen.

707
01:07:30,246 --> 01:07:32,226
We don't have money for eating also.

708
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:37,128
Mahi is sleeping in starvation.

709
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:41,925
I don't like to dance.

710
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:44,130
Do I look like I enjoy dancing
at the bar?

711
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:14,296
You please forgive me.

712
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:57,704
I won't let you get
lost in that bad world.

713
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:06,285
I will not allow you
to disappear like this.

714
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:14,484
I will take you back
to the village Rakhi.

715
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:20,200
You please forgive me.

716
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:49,328
"l can't live, O beloved."

717
01:09:49,418 --> 01:09:58,429
"l can't live, O beloved."

718
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:07,541
"Moments, don't go away."

719
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:18,355
"lf possible, stay with
me for lifetime."

720
01:10:20,149 --> 01:10:28,261
"l can't live, O beloved."

721
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:36,003
"l can't live, O beloved."

722
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:41,406
"O beloved."

723
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:08,739
The black case is just chasing to us.

724
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:17,507
Since long it is behind us. Drive fast.

725
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:30,428
"My heart is racing.
It is very crazy."

726
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:37,232
"My heart is racing.
It is very crazy."

727
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:40,330
"The moon is the
lock of your behavior.."

728
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:41,238
He is coming behind us.

729
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:44,106
"The moon is the lock of
your behavior.."

730
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:50,181
Do one thing. Take right from here.

"City lights."

734
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:07,701
"City lights."
- Hey rickshaw, move aside!

735
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:10,162
"City lights."

736
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:15,808
"There's darkness as well as
brightness here."

737
01:12:15,964 --> 01:12:19,343
"it is like a cobweb."

738
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:24,612
"The caravan is fighting with speed."

739
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:28,950
Gone.

740
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:30,350

Why he was chasing us?

743
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:39,893
We did the right thing.

744
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:43,567
After all we are
a 'Security Service'!

745
01:12:46,295 --> 01:12:47,569
Good.

746
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:51,575

01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:18,631
You can come.

752
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:25,643
After death of Vakar Sudha

753
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:28,207
She feels good to meet my partner.

754

01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:42,058
He has left but not eating the spinach.

You will beat me.

762
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,671
He has kept my one name.

763
01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:56,966

01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:00,669

766

It is good.

775
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:29,342
The meal is good then
why you are not eating.

776
01:14:31,233 --> 01:14:33,907
Why are you shying. You speak.

01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:19,690
You will not give spinach to me.

01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:37,266
This place is in the
center of the Mumbai.

791
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:41,143
All around are the buildings only.

792
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:46,680
Buildings surround it and
right in the center is this shit hole.

793

You see that building in front side.

795
01:15:57,986 --> 01:15:59,693
You are looking these houses.

796
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:06,899
They are not houses but the
dreams which have been fulfilled.

797

803
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:51,042
Solanki is doing that only.

01:16:51,073 --> 01:16:52,984
He has taken money
for four flats form me.

805

I did not picked up any packet.

828

Sir he has not taken any packet.
He is a good boy.

829
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:16,900
You may check it again.

01:18:58,767 --> 01:18:59,973
Should I take off your boxers too?

836
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:25,496
You would have thought.

837
01:19:26,361 --> 01:19:27,362
What?

838
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:32,567
We will shoot them here

01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:35,743
No sir.

840
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:37,909
Really?

841
01:19:40,642 --> 01:19:41,620

01:19:43,211 --> 01:19:45,157
Then what will be
difference in them and us.

843
01:19:47,516 --> 01:19:52,261
There is a difference
because we are fool and honest.

844
01:19:53,755 --> 01:19:58,226
Whole day we are working
and they are thieves.

845
01:19:58,593 --> 01:20:02,006
We keep standing Mumbai
and they are enjoying.

846
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:10,143
We are getting fifteen
thousand for fifteen crores.

847

01:20:21,149 --> 01:20:23,288

01:20:30,692 --> 01:20:34,265
They are the number two people..

851
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:37,774
..and no one will come to know anything.

852
01:20:43,772 --> 01:20:45,581
Sir you are joking.

853
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:49,917
I am joking.

854
01:21:05,427 --> 01:21:06,531

01:21:26,348 --> 01:21:27,326

Come.

859
01:21:46,701 --> 01:21:49,841
There is a bad news.

I told you about my side business..

864
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:07,791
..now it is stopped.

865
01:22:10,492 --> 01:22:12,267
I was bringing them in this house only.

866
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:14,396
They don't like the hotel etc.

867
01:22:16,364 --> 01:22:17,342
Have a seat.

868
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:22,274
Are you following what I am saying?

869
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:28,217
That girl I was seeing, she left me.

870
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:32,422
It's all over!
- Okay, yeah, good.

871
01:22:33,548 --> 01:22:34,822
Not good! It's sad!

872
01:22:37,819 --> 01:22:39,298
Now this house is with me.

873
01:22:41,823 --> 01:22:44,531
I gave it on 7 months lease
and he paid deposit to me.

874
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:47,102
I thought to give some one on rent.

875
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:50,300
You know anyone who
is in need of the house.

876
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:52,974
I don't know of anyone.

877
01:22:53,234 --> 01:22:54,440
Don't know.

878
01:22:55,837 --> 01:22:57,248
Someone in Govind Street?

879
01:22:58,039 --> 01:22:59,712
Anyone looking for a house to stay?

880
01:22:59,774 --> 01:23:00,844

01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:03,320

Don't know.

This is very slow
film and what I tell you.

884
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:10,721
This is for you.

885
01:23:10,785 --> 01:23:12,196
I brought you to show the house.

886
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:13,927

887
01:23:15,223 --> 01:23:20,935
A spacious room, 24 hour
water supply, a clean bathroom"

888
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:23,567
Well, it's a little dirty.
We will have it cleaned!

889
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:25,470
It's nice!

890
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,474
I have some clothes in the wardrobe,
I'll collect them later.

891
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:32,443
Did you like it?

892
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:35,213
This is not for me.

893
01:23:37,278 --> 01:23:38,484
Why not for you?

894
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:43,890
I don't have money.

895
01:23:45,387 --> 01:23:46,661
Who is the owner of the house.

896
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:49,096
It's me, right?

897
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:51,601
You give me money on getting salary.

898
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:52,966
This is much more.

899
01:23:53,395 --> 01:23:55,875
I've already paid the deposit.
When you move out, I'll collect it.

900
01:23:56,064 --> 01:23:57,509
No big deal!

901
01:23:58,767 --> 01:24:00,246
Come on!
Let's go get your family.

902
01:24:01,803 --> 01:24:04,807

Let's go!

905
01:24:13,515 --> 01:24:18,828
"My heart is running..

906
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:23,096
..behind the shadow."

907
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:29,507
"it tries daily to..

908
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:34,071
"take the moon into his hands."

909
01:24:34,502 --> 01:24:39,815
"This thirsty bird..

910
01:24:39,841 --> 01:24:48,283
..should get a river.
Let me sleep."

911
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:53,526
"Let me weave dreams."

912
01:24:55,690 --> 01:25:00,070
"Let me sleep."

913
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:02,699
You are not getting late for work?
- "Let me weave dreams."

914
01:25:02,964 --> 01:25:05,444
I have an off day to celebrate the
event of moving to this new house.

915
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:10,972
I'll quit my job as soon
as you get paid your wages.

916
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:16,319
You have to quit your job isn't it?

917
01:25:19,747 --> 01:25:20,987
Come on, cheer up.

918
01:25:28,156 --> 01:25:37,201
"There are so many faces,
but everyone is alone."

919
01:25:38,867 --> 01:25:48,220
"Your city is awake day
and night unnecessarily."

920
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:54,144
"In this funfair of faces,
let someone meet me."

921
01:25:59,954 --> 01:26:07,497
"Let me sleep.
Let me weave dreams."

922
01:26:10,365 --> 01:26:18,978
"Let me sleep.
Let me weave dreams."

923
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:21,551
Sir you did lot for us.

924
01:26:22,043 --> 01:26:23,647
No one does anything for anyone.

925
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:26,615
I mean it.

926
01:26:49,971 --> 01:26:51,143
Let us go sir.

927
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:16,706
I told you the story
of my partner Vakar..

928
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:19,704
..as how he was killed.

929
01:27:23,037 --> 01:27:24,243
It was a true story.

930
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:27,382
But the end was something different.

931
01:28:10,685 --> 01:28:14,690
After shooting Vakar they
have gone to leave the box.

932
01:28:19,861 --> 01:28:21,363
That box is still with me.

933
01:28:41,783 --> 01:28:43,126
Then now you return it sir.

934
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:49,066
Now we can not return it.

935
01:28:50,692 --> 01:28:51,670
It is too late now.

936
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:55,531
You know how much money
is there in the box.

937
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:00,737
Lots of money!

938
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:04,547
I want that you..

939
01:29:06,374 --> 01:29:08,183
..bring the key of
the box and give to me.

940
01:29:10,578 --> 01:29:11,420
From where I will bring sir?

941
01:29:11,579 --> 01:29:12,319
Form command.

942
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:15,687
We will do theft.

943
01:29:20,788 --> 01:29:21,892
I will do the theft.

944
01:29:22,223 --> 01:29:25,693
No no, you and myself will do the theft.

945
01:29:30,765 --> 01:29:32,039
Sir it is not possible for me.

946
01:29:32,533 --> 01:29:33,375
Why?

947
01:29:34,836 --> 01:29:35,712
Why you will not do.

948
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:37,406
Sir I am not the thief.

949
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:40,349
I've just got a job.
lam living a happy, peaceful life.

950
01:29:40,908 --> 01:29:42,182
What the life is going on?

951
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:47,255
You are getting fifteen thousand
and what will happen with this.

952
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:49,160
What you think?

953
01:29:50,418 --> 01:29:52,989
Mahi is growing and you will
keep the family in the gutter only.

954
01:29:54,956 --> 01:29:55,991
What you thought.

955
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:57,468
I can not do the theft.

956
01:29:58,993 --> 01:30:01,371
The theft is bad thing.
Why would you steal!

957
01:30:02,463 --> 01:30:05,239
Your wife is dancing in the bar.

958
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,273
Stealing is bad! Right!

959
01:30:10,204 --> 01:30:13,083
Don't you get any dreams in the night?

960
01:30:13,875 --> 01:30:15,479
This is my family matter
and you don't speak in between.

961
01:30:16,744 --> 01:30:17,984
Men are tossing money
at your wife's face..

962
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:19,558
You don't talk about my wife.

963
01:30:19,947 --> 01:30:22,826
They try to touch her..
- Don't say anything about my wife!

964
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:26,293
You don't think that she is dancing
and so many people are around her.

965
01:30:26,754 --> 01:30:28,392
You don't talk about my wife.

966
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:40,607
You and myself have been trapped badly.

967
01:30:41,035 --> 01:30:42,275
What I did?

968
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:43,780
We are trapped.
- What have I done?

969
01:30:43,838 --> 01:30:45,476
Because in he house where
you are staying is in..

970
01:30:45,973 --> 01:30:47,816
..your name but I have taken it.

971
01:30:49,043 --> 01:30:50,920
All the papers of the command are bogus.

972
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:53,659
The box is in that house only.

973
01:30:55,082 --> 01:30:57,619
The police will feel that
you are with the Vakar gang..

974
01:30:57,685 --> 01:30:58,595
..and that is why you have killed him.

975
01:30:58,653 --> 01:31:00,189
You have trapped me.
- And you joined this job for the key.

976
01:31:00,221 --> 01:31:01,791
You have trapped me.
- I did not trapped you.

977
01:31:01,923 --> 01:31:05,200
- That is why I got this job?!
- No!

978
01:31:05,993 --> 01:31:08,269
You have trapped me!
- I've not trapped you!

979
01:31:08,329 --> 01:31:09,433
This is for us. For our families.

980
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:11,100
I thought that you are helping
me but now you are trapping me.

981
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:12,337
lam helping you.

982
01:31:12,433 --> 01:31:14,435
Just hear me out.. - I trusted you!

983
01:31:15,102 --> 01:31:16,103
You are trapping me!

984
01:31:16,204 --> 01:31:18,047
I told you that I am not trapping you.

985
01:31:20,908 --> 01:31:22,353
lam not trapping you.

986
01:31:23,744 --> 01:31:25,018
I trusted you!

987
01:31:29,817 --> 01:31:30,955
Scoundrel.

988
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:35,934
You trapped me..

989
01:32:01,983 --> 01:32:03,326
Brother, listen to me..

990
01:32:05,953 --> 01:32:09,730
Let's do it.
Nothing will happen.

991
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:14,871
I have planned everything
and nothing will happen.

992
01:32:15,263 --> 01:32:17,004
It will be all right.

993
01:32:17,398 --> 01:32:18,741
You please forgive me.

994
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:21,210
Please forgive me, Sir.
lam a poor man.

995
01:32:22,303 --> 01:32:24,078
I can not do the theft. - Don't refuse.

996
01:32:25,206 --> 01:32:27,550
I came here to live
the life with honesty..

997
01:32:27,608 --> 01:32:29,417
..but it will be totally destroyed.

998
01:32:29,477 --> 01:32:33,823
They all are the thieves
only and everything happen here.

999
01:32:35,182 --> 01:32:37,025
I have planned everything.
Nothing will happen

1000
01:32:37,218 --> 01:32:38,288
It's my word..

1001
01:32:38,319 --> 01:32:41,357
I request you please
my life will be spoiled.

1002
01:32:43,925 --> 01:32:45,029
You agree to it.

1003
01:32:57,505 --> 01:32:58,813
One box will be theft.

1004
01:33:00,141 --> 01:33:03,315
Don't worry everything
is planned and all are safe.

1005
01:33:05,012 --> 01:33:08,425
Those three people
in the bar will help us.

1006
01:33:11,452 --> 01:33:13,227
As the box will be stolen.

1007
01:33:13,821 --> 01:33:15,459
We both will be called in the command.

1008
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:18,461
lam senior and that
is why I will be called first.

1009
01:33:19,193 --> 01:33:20,570
I will be there for 15 minutes.

1010
01:33:21,762 --> 01:33:24,936
You have these 15 minutes with
you for going in the locker room.

1011
01:33:25,466 --> 01:33:29,608
You will get the code
before going in the command.

1012
01:33:30,638 --> 01:33:32,015
Everything is arranged.

1013
01:33:33,574 --> 01:33:34,951
You will go inside..

1014
01:33:35,076 --> 01:33:39,991
..and get the impression of
the key of box No. 809 on the soap.

1015
01:33:40,348 --> 01:33:42,350
Once I am out of there,
then you are free too.

1016
01:33:43,751 --> 01:33:44,991
Then everything will be over.

1017
01:33:45,586 --> 01:33:46,690
No problems!

1018
01:33:47,955 --> 01:33:49,866
We don't have to kill anyone.
That's all we have to do!

1019
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:54,701
Okay?

1020
01:34:54,288 --> 01:34:56,131
What you people were doing?

1021
01:34:59,126 --> 01:35:01,163
Myself and Deepak going to the client.

1022
01:35:08,035 --> 01:35:11,073
The black color car came
and they tried to snatch the box.

1023
01:35:12,173 --> 01:35:13,982
Where is the key?
Where is the key to the other box?

1024
01:35:14,041 --> 01:35:15,179
Tell me..
- Hey! Shoot him down.

1025
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:21,919
When sir has not left
the box then they fired.

1026
01:35:37,198 --> 01:35:38,268
And where you had been?

1027
01:35:38,599 --> 01:35:40,101
I was in the car sir.

1028
01:35:40,468 --> 01:35:45,076
When I came out then
sir was finished on the spot.

1029
01:35:46,207 --> 01:35:48,710
Then I called Sachin
on phone and they back.

1030
01:35:48,776 --> 01:35:49,948
And you were sitting there.

1031
01:35:50,277 --> 01:35:52,883
When I came out then the car had gone.

1032
01:35:54,315 --> 01:35:56,090
Sir, Vishnu Sirjust breathed
his last, right there.

1033
01:36:10,831 --> 01:36:12,242
You know the rule of the company.

1034
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:15,439
Now you go and give
this news to his wife.

1035
01:36:17,204 --> 01:36:18,547
You were his partner.

1036
01:36:20,207 --> 01:36:21,584
Sir I know.

1037
01:36:21,942 --> 01:36:23,979
Till the police enquiry

Police will come.

1039
01:36:31,786 --> 01:36:34,357
And till then you will
not get salary also. Understand.

1040
01:36:36,056 --> 01:36:37,831
I worked for so many days
and I should get some amount.

1041
01:36:37,925 --> 01:36:39,029
You want wages, eh?!

1042
01:36:40,327 --> 01:36:43,467
This is the insult of
my company and you want salary.

1043
01:36:43,564 --> 01:36:44,668
I did not killed sir.

1044
01:36:45,132 --> 01:36:46,475
Then who did it.

Sir if I get some money then.

1046
01:36:50,938 --> 01:36:54,215
You go out.

Sir, please give me
some money for food..

1050
01:37:02,149 --> 01:37:04,220
Forget about it!

01:37:05,619 --> 01:37:07,997
Get out of here.
Take him.

1052
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:31,683
Deepak.

1053
01:37:33,914 --> 01:37:35,018
Come.

1054
01:37:35,583 --> 01:37:36,926
Come.

1055
01:37:38,385 --> 01:37:40,331
Where is he? He is parking the car?

1056
01:37:42,590 --> 01:37:44,467
What's the matter? - That.

1057
01:37:55,236 --> 01:37:57,045
He is parking the car?

1058
01:38:08,315 --> 01:38:09,919
He is parking the car?

1059
01:38:11,919 --> 01:38:13,762
He is parking the car?

1060
01:38:15,556 --> 01:38:16,534
What?

1061
01:38:18,626 --> 01:38:20,970
What?

1062
01:39:25,426 --> 01:39:26,700
That box.

1063
01:39:29,029 --> 01:39:30,235
That box.

1064
01:39:31,298 --> 01:39:32,641
Where is that box?

1065
01:39:40,174 --> 01:39:43,917
He did not told me about any box.

1066
01:39:48,615 --> 01:39:50,390
I want that box.

1067
01:39:51,852 --> 01:39:54,230
Really I don't know.

1068
01:39:56,857 --> 01:39:58,336
I want that box.

1069
01:40:01,362 --> 01:40:05,276
I want that box.

1070
01:40:07,267 --> 01:40:08,405
I want that box.

1071
01:40:12,039 --> 01:40:15,248
I want that box.

1072
01:40:16,076 --> 01:40:20,024
I want that box.

1073
01:40:32,292 --> 01:40:33,703
You take care of yourself.

1074
01:40:55,382 --> 01:40:57,521
My mother spoke a lot of nonsense..

1075
01:40:59,887 --> 01:41:02,424
But one thing she
was telling correctly..

1076
01:41:03,257 --> 01:41:09,401
..that this poverty is
very bad and it is a disease.

1077
01:41:12,299 --> 01:41:14,279
Who are we?
We are poor.

1078
01:41:16,336 --> 01:41:19,249
Who are we?!

1079
01:41:19,940 --> 01:41:21,544
We are poor sir. - Poor.

1080
01:42:25,606 --> 01:42:29,349
"Save yourself from this lover."

1081
01:42:29,977 --> 01:42:33,220
"Stay away from thorns."

1082
01:42:34,381 --> 01:42:38,227
"Save yourself from this lover."

1083
01:42:38,685 --> 01:42:41,894
"Stay away from thorns."

1084
01:42:43,123 --> 01:42:47,037
"Fill darkness in your eyes."

1085
01:42:47,494 --> 01:42:50,532
"Stay away from such light."

1086
01:42:52,332 --> 01:42:53,902
Jayesh bhai he had touched me.

1087
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:01,717
You have slapped him.

1088
01:43:05,512 --> 01:43:06,923
Then?

1089
01:43:10,017 --> 01:43:11,121
You go out.

1090
01:43:14,054 --> 01:43:15,931
"Save yourself from this lover."

1091
01:43:16,023 --> 01:43:17,366
My money.

1092
01:43:18,058 --> 01:43:20,971
Get out. - "Stay away from thorns."

1093
01:43:34,675 --> 01:43:36,848
I had worked here and I want my money.

1094
01:43:36,944 --> 01:43:39,288
"Save yourself from this lover."

1095
01:43:53,660 --> 01:43:55,799
Hold her. Get out from here.

1096
01:43:56,363 --> 01:43:57,706
Get out of here.

1097
01:43:58,899 --> 01:44:03,211
"Love is a charade."

1098
01:44:35,869 --> 01:44:37,109
Who?

1099
01:44:37,204 --> 01:44:38,877
It's me! Open the door!

1100
01:44:48,148 --> 01:44:51,527
That Vishnu Sir,
who trapped me was killed today.

1101
01:44:53,353 --> 01:44:54,764
This house and other things are bogus.

1102
01:44:57,057 --> 01:44:59,037
There is lot of money in this box.

1103
01:45:00,093 --> 01:45:01,663
But key is not there.

1104
01:45:01,962 --> 01:45:03,339
I don't know you go and return it.

1105
01:45:03,430 --> 01:45:06,741
They will never believe to me.
How did I find this box?!

1106
01:45:08,368 --> 01:45:09,711
I'll be in trouble.

1107
01:45:10,337 --> 01:45:12,374
And I don't want to get trapped.
I want to get out from here.

1108
01:45:12,506 --> 01:45:15,783
I was telling you since first
day but you did not listen to me.

1109
01:45:15,842 --> 01:45:17,913
But where we will go?
- I don't know.

1110
01:45:17,978 --> 01:45:20,151
I don't want anything bad to happen.

1111
01:45:20,714 --> 01:45:21,886
Rakhi you listen to me.

1112
01:45:22,182 --> 01:45:23,991
Where we will go?

1113
01:45:25,485 --> 01:45:27,795
My desires would have brought
us back to this glamorous city.

1114
01:45:29,389 --> 01:45:31,391
It is very difficult to go from here.

1115
01:45:32,092 --> 01:45:33,196
Do you understand?

1116
01:45:35,462 --> 01:45:36,941
What you want to do?

1117
01:45:42,903 --> 01:45:44,007
Tell me.

1118
01:45:46,306 --> 01:45:47,478
I don't know..

1119
01:45:51,678 --> 01:45:53,817
..but I will never allow
to happen anything to you and Mahi.

1120
01:45:55,315 --> 01:45:57,420
lam going to take you away
from here, I promise.

1121
01:45:58,785 --> 01:46:00,492
You believe on me.

1122
01:46:07,694 --> 01:46:15,112
"You are the reason for me to smile."

1123
01:46:17,137 --> 01:46:24,988
"You are the reason I hum."

1124
01:46:25,612 --> 01:46:32,723
"l can't live, O beloved."

1125
01:46:32,753 --> 01:46:40,262
"l can't live, O beloved."

1126
01:46:47,801 --> 01:46:55,379
"Moments, don't go away."

1127
01:46:57,210 --> 01:47:05,425
"if possible, stay here forever."

1128
01:47:05,685 --> 01:47:12,625
"l can't live, O beloved."

1129
01:47:12,692 --> 01:47:21,840
"l can't live, O beloved."

1130
01:47:21,902 --> 01:47:27,409
"O beloved."

1131
01:48:04,845 --> 01:48:05,949
I was asked to come here.

1132
01:48:30,370 --> 01:48:31,508
I want my salary.

1133
01:48:33,273 --> 01:48:34,445
How you came inside?

1134
01:48:35,842 --> 01:48:37,583
I did the work and I want my salary.

1135
01:48:37,844 --> 01:48:38,686
Who allowed you to enter?

1136
01:48:38,745 --> 01:48:39,849
Give my money.

What is it?

1144
01:48:50,457 --> 01:48:52,403

My wife is working in
the bar because of you people.

Harder! Come on!

1202
01:53:21,861 --> 01:53:23,534
Don't let him escape!

"Why are you running?"

1240

"A bird fights with tears
and goes to sleep."

1241
