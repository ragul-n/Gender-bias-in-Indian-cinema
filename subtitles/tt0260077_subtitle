1
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,391
Sir, breakfast is ready.

2
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,990
Sir, you have to meet
Mr. varun at 3pm.

3
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,400
And attend the Indian Merchants
meeting at 4 pm.

4
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,994
That means, a meeting of
big personalities.

5
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:28,404
Then you have to meet
legal advisor, Saxena.

6
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:33,001
And then...
- I won't do any work after that.

7
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,352
Why, you rogue!

8
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:47,018
I don't mind even
taking abuses from you.

9
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:51,427
Where were you yesterday? You didrt
come to the office, or the club.

10
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:52,520
I had gone to Khandala.

11
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,430
You drank there and were
lost in memories of Sushma.

12
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,366
No, nothing like that.

13
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:00,031
Friend, many people
have failed in love.

14
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,308
But there is none like you.
Howmany times have I told you...

15
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,708
that Sushma is married now.
Forget her now atleast.

16
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,970
Stop lecturing and
listen to something important.

17
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:11,380
You were telling me about that
estate agent. Send him to me.

18
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:18,324
Why? Want to get the Taj Mahal made?
- No, a hotel, in Balipuram.

19
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,382
Where you met Sushma the first time?

20
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,985
Now stop your nonsense
or you've had it!

21
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,592
I don't want to have anything,
because I'm having an egg now.

22
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:32,403
Alright Partner, your job will be
done. I'll send the agent.

23
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:33,995
His name is chhagan Patel.

24
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,014
So you are back, Junior?

25
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,015
Don't you feel ashamed?

26
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,417
very shameless you are!

27
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,022
You said you are
going for two days...

28
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,362
but are showing me your
face after 15 days.

29
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:07,167
You'll stop playing the mouth organ
once I stop giving your pocket money.

30
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,965
Don't do that, brother!
- Then tell me where you had gone.

31
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:15,971
Lonavla, then Poona, then Bangalore.
Then Ooty, and then straight here...

32
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,313
to Ghatkopar,
to my elder brother.

33
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:21,376
Reason for return?
- I'm broke!

34
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,987
That's why you remembered your
brother.

35
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:30,986
I won't give you a penny.
Then I'll cry. I've lost my parents,

36
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,999
and if my elder brother turns away...
what do I do if not cry?

37
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,401
Shall I cry?
You'll never change!

38
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,193
Brother!

39
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,738
Who is that?
- I have to go.

40
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,410
There's a meeting of
the musical troupe.

41
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:50,414
Listen! Take the money,
but atleast return the purse.

42
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,409
I'll polish it and send it to you.

43
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:42,998
"I love you so much... "

44
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:59,012
"not just the eyes, it cannot
be held even in the whole world"

45
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,393
"How long willyou live in my heart?"

46
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:53,403
"Till when will
you not leave my side?"

47
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:58,405
"Like the earth never
stops going round the sun"

48
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:02,344
"I will never stop being besides you"

49
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:09,345
"I love you so much!"

50
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:54,990
"You are my life's aim"

51
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:06,343
"Willyou remember this promise?"

52
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:10,946
"I will not forget you"

53
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:15,944
"Like the heart does
not forget to beat"

54
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:22,359
"I love you so much!"

55
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:58,395
"I live with your support"

56
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:09,998
"How do you spend your days?"

57
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:14,402
"I will not be able
to bear your separation"

58
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:19,007
"If I get separated from you,
I will die"

59
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:26,017
"I love you so much!"

60
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,446
My daughter's marriage
to an ordinary man like you?

61
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:02,386
What is your salary?
Rs. 100? Rs. 200?

62
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,390
Don't you dare
even come to this house!

63
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,412
Sir, Mr. chhagan Patel
wants to meet you.

64
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,504
Send him in.

65
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,413
Hello sir.
chhagan Patel at your service!

66
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:35,357
come in. Sit down.
- Tell me, what can I do for you?

67
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:38,420
I want a plot in Balipuram,
to construct a hotel.

68
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,023
Within 10 days.
- That's all? Just one plot in 10

69
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:47,038
days?
In 10 days,

70
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,438
I can showyou a hundred plots.
Not hundred, I just want one plot.

71
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:54,445
The plot should be beautiful,
and the title should be clear.

72
00:11:55,047 --> 00:12:00,713
Don't worry about that. I will get
you a hotel plot at such a place...

73
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,977
that when people come to your hotel,
they will be awed...

74
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,990
and while leaving, they'll sigh.

75
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:09,984
Lalwani, I have given the hotel
contract to Mr. chhagan Patel.

76
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,997
Go to Balipuram with him
and finalize the plot with him.

77
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,998
I have a small request, sir.
If along with the plot...

78
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:21,403
you give me the construction work
too,

79
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,999
my life's desire will be fulfilled.
Finalize the plot first,

80
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,408
we'll see after that.
Lalwani, what do

81
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:40,014
you think of my secretary?
I mean, your secretary

82
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,020
is very beautiful.
That is why I always

83
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,021
keep her with me.
Lalwani, I like you very much.

84
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:51,033
You can treat everything
that's mine as yours.

85
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:55,438
chhagan, you have pleased me.

86
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:18,986
Enjoying?

87
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:27,396
Lalwani, tell me,
howmuch salary do you get?

88
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,407
I get a very good salary.
Rs. 1500!

89
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:31,999
Rs. 1500?

90
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:40,010
Lalwani, in these times,
Rs. 1500 gets over in the first week.

91
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,746
Speak softly.
- Why?

92
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,750
I'd like to tellyou something.

93
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:53,021
If instead of a private plot,
I get a government plot...

94
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:56,424
know howmuch money I can give you?

95
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,027
Rs. 50000.
- Rs. 50000!

96
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:04,373
But chhagan,
howwill we get a government plot?

97
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:10,381
With money, you can get everything.

98
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:15,317
But I have heard the municipality
officer there, Mr. Krishnan...

99
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:16,979
is a very strict man.

100
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:22,722
Lalwani, God has not
given anyone two backs.

101
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,987
He has given only one back,
that too, behind.

102
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:30,001
What we have in the
front is a stomach.

103
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:34,996
And one has to do a lot for it.

104
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,008
Right Shabbo?
- Yes.

105
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:45,416
Let's see how strict
Krishnan can be.

106
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:55,017
Hello! And sorry Mr. Krishnan,
we came before time.

107
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,028
It's okay Mr. chhagan Patel.
Take a seat.

108
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,030
Ramu, get two tea.

109
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,357
What can I do for you?

110
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:08,963
Before I answer your question...

111
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:15,378
first you tell us,
do you eat, or drink?

112
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,973
Mr. chhagan Patel,
are you trying to bribe me?

113
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:27,390
No! I was asking,
do you chewtobacco, or smoke it?

114
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:33,397
I neither chewtobacco, nor smoke.
- I chewtobacco.

115
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:37,400
Mr. Krishnan, we want to talk
to you about land allotment.

116
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,402
That department is of Mr. Gupta.

117
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:42,997
Have you met Mr. Krishnan?

118
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:48,403
Mr. Gupta, please don't take offence,
but Mr. Krishnan is very strict.

119
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:52,407
Nowyou tell me,
why did he get angry?

120
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:56,419
I only asked him whether
he eats, or drinks.

121
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:04,962
Sorry.
- Tell me, what can I do for you?

122
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:14,363
Forget all that, you tell us,
do you eat, or drink?

123
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:21,375
Mr. chhagan, I eat, and also drink.

124
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:29,319
Mr. Gupta, I don't butter anyone, but
I must say you are one in a million.

125
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:32,380
Even you recognise a
person in minutes.

126
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:40,330
What are you doing here, Mr. Gupta?
See my secretary there.

127
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,991
She looks like a mermaid in water.

128
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:03,148
Mr. Gupta, you like my secretary?
- She's beautiful!

129
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:09,355
Isn't she?
Shabbo! My mermaid!

130
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:12,362
come here. Look, I have a guest.

131
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:26,707
Shabbo, meet him, he's Mr. Gupta.
- Pleased to meet you.

132
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,979
You finished your swim?
- Yes.

133
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:42,388
We have started drinking, Mr. chhagan.
Nowthe eating...

134
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:51,993
Actually, the government has no
plot that suits your requirement.

135
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:57,738
Father Benevolent has a plot
that is lying unused.

136
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,342
But the old man will not sell.
- Why?

137
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:04,347
Because it is an old graveyard.
- Graveyard?

138
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:10,955
So what if it is a graveyard?
God gives people from the sky.

139
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,355
Maybe he gives us from the
earth below.

140
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:26,962
Wow! Lalwani, this is great!

141
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:33,970
Lalwani, you don't have to read it.
Just seeing the cement...

142
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:40,383
this mason, chhagan Patel, can tell
you

143
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:44,581
This plot is perfect for a hotel.

144
00:18:56,001 --> 00:19:02,338
You are seeing my old friends'
graves?

145
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:12,341
- Yes Father. They are very old.
There is no one to take care of them.

146
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:18,355
No one places flowers on them...
or light a candle. They have no one.

147
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:23,360
But Father, those who have no one,
instead of those dead...

148
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:28,297
those who are alive and have no one,
why don't you give land for them?

149
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,359
No! there is lot of land
for those who are alive.

150
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,700
If not this land, another one.
But they need only six feet of

151
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,965
land...
and you want to snatch

152
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:43,376
even that from them?
Don't be angry, Father. The dead

153
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:49,181
are sleeping peacefully forever.
But those alive are helpless.

154
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:53,984
- What are you trying to say?
Father, we few people together

155
00:19:55,994 --> 00:20:00,397
want to build an orphanage.
Small, angelic children

156
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:06,403
don't have a roof over their heads.
If you look into their eyes,

157
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:15,404
you will see Jesus in them.
I am not a rich builder, but I am

158
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,003
working for free on this project.
Right Lalwani?

159
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:22,748
And my late friend, a millionaire,
his widow...

160
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:27,014
is ready to give away everything
for orphaned children.

161
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:33,760
But we are not getting a small
plot of land for this good cause.

162
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:38,764
We made several rounds to the
government office for this purpose.

163
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:42,438
But nothing came of it.
You can ask Mr. Gupta.

164
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,034
He's right, Father.

165
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:54,442
Father, we reposed our faith
in Jesus and came to you.

166
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:58,454
And we are sure you will
showmercy to the orphans.

167
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:04,392
Father, we need your help.
UntiI we don't get a plot of land...

168
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:06,726
this good job will never get done.

169
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:15,396
Son, you also try
to convince Father.

170
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:27,748
Lalwani, I have almost
convinced the old man.

171
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,011
Now let's go to Bombay
and get money from Suraj.

172
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:36,427
come chhagan, sit down.
Sir willjoin us soon.

173
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:59,042
'To darling Suraj,
with lots of love, Sushma'

174
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:01,381
Keep it! Stupid!

175
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,387
Lalwani, is she Suraj's fiancee?
- No.

176
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,719
Then she must be his wife.
- No.

177
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:09,383
She would be, but she is not.

178
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,989
That means, the dream broke.

179
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,730
Hello sir.
- Sit down.

180
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,666
So, howwas the trip?
- Oh, it was successful.

181
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,999
And by God's grace,
we even found a good plot.

182
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:31,410
But the plot belongs to a widow,
and she refused to sell.

183
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,417
But when she heard a price of two
million, she was silenced.

184
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,419
Money speaks, sir.

185
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:40,016
Lalwani, Patel must
get all the money today.

186
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:45,021
This is the hotel plan, sir.
Hold this, Lalwani.

187
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,760
Sir, this is the main building.

188
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,764
The bedrooms will be here.
This is the restaurant and bar.

189
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,436
This is the cabaret room.

190
00:22:53,638 --> 00:23:00,976
The classrooms will be here. And
here,

191
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,969
the rooms for innocent, poor orphans.
Right Lalwani?

192
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:11,320
A hospital will come up here.
Along with the innocent orphans...

193
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,984
even the poor people of the
village will be treated for free.

194
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:16,984
Hello Father.
- Madam!

195
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:21,196
Father, she is Mrs. Sarita,
my late friend's widow.

196
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,734
Father, she is the lady who is
investing all her money...

197
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:26,993
into this orphanage.

198
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,342
May God keep you happy.

199
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:37,007
Father, to do good for these
orphans is now in your hands.

200
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,408
Father, I don't have children.

201
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,421
I will be a mother
to these innocent orphans...

202
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:48,015
and give them the love of a mother.

203
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,022
Don't cry, child.

204
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,972
Get the transfer papers made.

205
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:04,965
I will sign.

206
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:09,973
chhagan Patel, how could you assume
I will make a double agreement?

207
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:13,715
From orphanage to hotel?
My God! this is too much.

208
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:15,976
You are fooling the old man.

209
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:19,990
You are unnecessarily
getting angry, Mr. Lawyer.

210
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,392
The old man has given consent.

211
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:29,399
Nowwhether a hotel comes up on it,
or an orphanage, what do you lose?

212
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:33,402
This is cheating,
and I cannot do it.

213
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:37,407
Lawyer, you are our legal advisor.

214
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:45,006
Papers signed by you will be added
to our files without any queries.

215
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,415
No, I cannot do this.

216
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,012
Please leave!

217
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:08,964
I have seen a lot of money.

218
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,970
You think you can buy me with money?

219
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,982
Why did my voice choke?

220
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:34,398
Money can silence
even big men, Mr. Lawyer!

221
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:55,418
What is the matter, Tiger?
What is wrong with you?

222
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:05,362
They are our friends.
Yudi, take Tiger inside.

223
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,959
Tiger, what is wrong with you?
You bit Yudi?

224
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:17,975
Yudi, is it very bad?
- No Father.

225
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:20,967
come.

226
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,382
What is wrong with you today?

227
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:34,982
come inside. Wonder what
is wrong with Tiger today.

228
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:38,394
He troubled you.
- No Father.

229
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,008
How are you, son?
- I'm fine, Father.

230
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,411
Yudi, get tea for everyone.

231
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:06,947
Mr. Kapoor, are the documents ready?
- Yes Father.

232
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:17,367
My God! What happened?
The main fuse must have gone.

233
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:22,367
It's okay, I'll light candles.

234
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,996
Do these papers state that I'm giving
this land only for the orphanage?

235
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:58,736
It's very clearly stated, Father.
... It's very clear.

236
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:00,935
Look, clause number three.

237
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:31,374
Mr. chhagan Patel, Mr. Kapoor is a
capable and good lawyer of Balipuram.

238
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,974
careful! You'll break them!
- What happened?

239
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:44,979
Father, I broke your glasses.
- What is wrong with you today, Yudi?

240
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,382
Mr. Kapoor, nowyou tell me
where I should sign.

241
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,386
You are a witness in this good act.

242
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:56,398
Take... sign here.

243
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:04,931
Here.

244
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:15,944
Here... and here.

245
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:24,954
careful. Dig all graves.
Ensure no cross breaks.

246
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:29,968
From here.
What are you staring at? Go away!

247
00:29:30,003 --> 00:29:31,959
Sir... sir!
- What is it?

248
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:34,360
A skull.

249
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:39,375
Bury it here only, I'll be back.
And keep your mouth shut!

250
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,382
Sir, you said these graves are old.

251
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:48,976
But we are digging out
skulls and corpses here.

252
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,390
Skulls and corpses?
- Yes, skulls and corpses.

253
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,994
Do one thing. Stop work immediately.

254
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:00,724
And the people standing behind,
send them packing

255
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:05,993
And listen! In the dark of night,
bury all corpses in a huge pit.

256
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,059
No one must know.

257
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:13,000
And get all the crosses stored in
a godown. They'll fetch a good price.

258
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,066
Go!

259
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:21,008
What are you standing here for?
Is some show going on here?

260
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:26,682
come on, leave! Don't stare at me.
Leave I said!

261
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:34,763
Uncle, what are you doing here? Go
and

262
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:38,025
What you are doing is not right.

263
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,437
Not right indeed!

264
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:50,438
What's good about the morning?
You sold your soul to the deviI?

265
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:54,780
I don't understand.
- Indeed!

266
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:59,456
Liquor will be drunk on the
bodies of our late fore fathers.

267
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:03,994
Whores will dance!
A hotel will come up here.

268
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:10,190
Not a hotel George,
an orphanage is being build here.

269
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:18,401
Orphanage? Look there!
Is that a board of an orphanage?

270
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:44,229
What's going on here?
I gave this land for an orphanage.

271
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:45,424
Orphanage?

272
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:49,438
Father, I bought this land
to construct a hotel.

273
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:52,441
Hotel? But I have the agreement.

274
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:57,037
It clearly states I am
giving this land for an orphanage.

275
00:31:57,448 --> 00:32:02,385
What are you talking?
Father, even I have an agreement.

276
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,387
You signed here; look.

277
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:08,720
Your lawyer has
signed here as witness.

278
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:10,392
And even Mr. Gupta
has signed as witness.

279
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,389
I told you I don't lie.

280
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:27,401
Where is that widow?
- Are you inquiring about me?

281
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:32,744
I am not even married yet.
I'm single.

282
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:47,023
Yudi, you sold your soul for money?

283
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:07,974
Father is dead!

284
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:50,019
Bring it here... soon... quiet!

285
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:44,003
Move!

286
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:56,421
Great! Wonderful!

287
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:04,960
D'souza, don't worry, I'll myself
choose the best cross for you.

288
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,367
Right Shabbo?
- Yes.

289
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:10,372
Yudi, close the door securely.
- Yes.

290
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:59,613
"Who has come to the party?"

291
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:02,959
"Who has stirred my heart so"

292
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:06,353
"She is hot!"

293
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:09,364
"Every heart said it has been
looted!"

294
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,959
"My beauty is enchanting"

295
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:16,363
"I am a dream girl"

296
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:19,966
"If any guy touches me"

297
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:23,370
"My body will get soiled"

298
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:47,994
"My charms never fail"

299
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:51,398
"My youth is my world"

300
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:55,001
"You are nothing, crazy boy"

301
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:58,405
"The whole world is crazy about me"

302
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:01,951
"You should not act so proud"

303
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:05,345
"After making someone
so crazy about you"

304
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:08,949
"O Flame, you will become obscure"

305
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,352
"If there is no moth
hovering over you"

306
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:15,956
"Who has come to the party?"

307
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:53,994
"Of what use will it be?"

308
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:57,404
"How long willyou save it?"

309
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:00,944
"You are a river of youth in spate"

310
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:04,337
"It will recede one day"

311
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,941
"Try your best"

312
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:10,946
"You will not get anything"

313
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,356
"The one who touches my heart first"

314
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:18,356
"Only he will be able to touch my
body"

315
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,955
"Who has come to the party?"

316
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:27,354
You dance very well.
- That's the only thing he can do.

317
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,957
It seems you are in a mood
to praise me. I am leaving.

318
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,970
Sanjay, you were going to come to
office today and begin working.

319
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:38,373
I thought you were joking.
I'll come tomorrow at 11.

320
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:43,970
You think he will come?
- He surely will.

321
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:48,712
Bet Rs. 5000?
- Bring the money along tomorrow.

322
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:50,977
You too.
- Alright.

323
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:59,986
After three minutes, it's going to be
11, and you'll lose. Keep Rs. 5000

324
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,992
ready
You keep your Rs. 5000 ready,

325
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,992
because he's surely going to come.
He won't come.

326
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,059
He is my brother, I know him.
can I come in?

327
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:15,410
Partner, cough up Rs. 5000.
- I'm counting.

328
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:17,413
You mean brother had laid
a bet I will not come?

329
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:18,504
Yes.

330
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:25,421
Brother, he paid me Rs. 2500
to come here on time.

331
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,753
What! You cheated me?

332
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:32,427
Don't worry, this Rs. 5000
is Sanjay's...

333
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:36,022
if he goes to Balipuram
and does the hotel decoration.

334
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:39,764
The decoration will be so good,
you will be awed. I promise!

335
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:43,029
Also promise you won't
run away from there.

336
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:46,042
We'll celebrate your birthday there.
- Okay brother, I won't.

337
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,441
Promise?
- Promise.

338
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:03,994
Please drink... it's just a soft
drink.

339
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:05,995
- No... I don't drink.
Even kids drink this in America.

340
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:09,988
Even kids drink it.

341
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:25,345
come Mr. Sanjay.
- Enjoying yourself, huh Lalwani?

342
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:27,407
Lalwani, who is he?

343
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:30,748
He is Mr. vijay's younger brother,
Sanjay.

344
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:35,014
He's chhagan Patel, the contractor.
- Hello Mr. Sanjay.

345
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:38,755
Mr. vijay had called. You were going
to

346
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:42,021
If you mind, I will go back,
and come again tomorrow.

347
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:46,434
Nice joke.

348
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:49,030
Shabbo, my secretary.

349
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:56,036
Shake hands. Mr. Sanjay,
you must be tired, take rest.

350
00:41:56,447 --> 00:42:00,042
Shabbo, show him his room,
he'll take some rest.

351
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:13,989
Nice room.
- Yes, very nice.

352
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:17,399
This is a special room
for honeymoon couples.

353
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:23,406
Look, the bed is so soft. come!

354
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,739
I want to take a bath first.

355
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:31,413
If you bathe with hot water,
allyour tiredness will vanish.

356
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:35,408
I'll get your bath ready.

357
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:48,426
come.
- Nowyou leave. I'll manage.

358
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,390
I'd forgotten to keep the towel.

359
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:21,397
You want soap? Take.
... come, I'll scrub your back.

360
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:24,399
What!
- So what? You are not a stranger.

361
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,403
I'm feeling ticklish.

362
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:34,002
Even soap is like men,
it always slips.

363
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:39,746
He's enjoying himself. He's written
this letter from the hotel bathroom.

364
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:42,008
Lucky! What else has he written?

365
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:45,354
He's written he's living in the most
beautiful room...

366
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:47,014
that is the honeymoon suite.

367
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:50,425
Is he staying with some girl?
- Possible.

368
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:54,761
It's good you got him
involved in the hotel work.

369
00:43:55,232 --> 00:44:00,169
I wish he begins to like working,
and stops acting immature.

370
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:29,397
Sir... sir!

371
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:33,996
What if that rope breaks?

372
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,405
What if that rope breaks, sir?

373
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:44,006
can I ask something?
- Ask.

374
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:46,413
What if that ice melts?

375
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:04,957
What are you talking, Lawyer!
Is this the way to talk?

376
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:09,369
I don't understand why you want to
keep the orphanage papers with you.

377
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:12,965
Everyone knows I made the papers.
I have even signed as witness.

378
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:16,369
If anyone lays hands on these papers,
my license will get canceled.

379
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:17,969
I can even get jailed.

380
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:21,711
Even I can get jailed, Lalwani can
be jailed, all of them can get

381
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:25,386
jailed.
What nonsense you talk!

382
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:29,391
I have kept the papers with myself...
so that your lips are sealed.

383
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:31,984
- I will speak? What will I say?
That we cheated an innocent priest?

384
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:36,390
That we usurped a plot of graveyard
for free and sold it for two

385
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:37,989
million...
to build a hotel on it?

386
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,730
Why are you shouting?
I am not hard of hearing.

387
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:43,404
Speak softly, even walls have ears.

388
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:46,407
I have the papers,
and I have kept them safely.

389
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:27,973
What!

390
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:50,004
What do you want?

391
00:46:55,412 --> 00:47:01,351
Don't act too smart, lad. If you
care for your life, give the papers.

392
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:03,942
Move!

393
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:42,383
The rascal should not escape.
Surround the whole place.

394
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:48,390
You go here... you go there,
you go there... go!

395
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:04,330
I found Sanjay! he ran away!

396
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,352
These are a masors hands, lad.

397
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:23,358
One more, and you'll be knocked out!

398
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:35,362
YOU will be knocked out, you rogue,
when the papers reach my brothers...

399
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,965
and when they know how
much cheating you have done.

400
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:44,175
Not cheating, call it cunning.

401
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,974
If I made some money
with my cunning...

402
00:49:48,051 --> 00:49:49,985
why is it hurting you?

403
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:54,983
It is that priest who is hurt,
who lost his life.

404
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,722
How royally you fooled him.

405
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,730
You build a hotel
instead of an orphanage?

406
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,992
Mr. Sanjay, listen to me.
- You keep quiet, you cad!

407
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:14,399
He's dead!

408
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:16,996
What will happen now?
- We all will get arrested.

409
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:25,004
The papers are not in his pocket.
That means they'll be in his car.

410
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,407
Abdul, bury his body here.

411
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,429
The papers are not here.

412
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:54,033
I was mad to have got
involved with you.

413
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:00,382
chhagan, we have turned murderers.

414
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:04,385
Lalwani, dispose the car.

415
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:38,012
You are sitting here?
- What is the matter, partner?

416
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:41,421
You have come early morning.
- Yes, I am going to Balipuram.

417
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:46,425
You cannot leave before 18th, because
you have a board of directors

418
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:47,519
meeting.
So I thought...

419
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,758
Why don't you say you
want to meet your brother?

420
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:54,026
He's gone to work the first time.
Let me see how he is working.

421
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:57,039
And then, I fear that once the work
is over, he will run away from there.

422
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:58,096
He's compelled by habit.

423
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:03,376
Do one more trying. Send invitations
to important people of Balipuram.

424
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,380
So that we have a grand opening.

425
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,381
It's two hours already,
howmuch longer will it take?

426
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:19,393
It's difficult.
We may have to call a mechanic.

427
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:22,396
But I have to reach Balipuram today.
Howwill I go?

428
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,399
You'll get a bus on this road ahead.

429
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:27,402
You go, I'll get the car
repaired and follow.

430
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:29,403
Alright, give me the luggage.

431
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:49,219
I mean, where is the bus stop?
- Over there.

432
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:52,227
It was tired of standing, so it
lied down. But the stop is here.

433
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:56,422
Where does the bus go?
- Where do you want to go?

434
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:03,962
Yes, Balipuram.

435
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,372
You don't even knowthe name
of the place where you have to go.

436
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:08,968
Wonder where they come from.
- From Bombay.

437
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:10,969
Okay!

438
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:18,978
Stand quietly!
Don't sing, this is a bus stop.

439
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:20,378
The bus has come!

440
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:35,997
Wait! I'll go in first.
- Okay.

441
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:53,747
Why are you looking here?

442
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:55,423
I'm not looking at you,
I'm looking outside.

443
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:56,753
can't you see from there?
- No.

444
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,979
Nowwhat happened?
- Looks like the bus broke down.

445
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,383
Wonder whose face
I saw early morning.

446
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,474
Even me.

447
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:29,390
Is it my fault if the bus broke down?
Why are you pouncing on me?

448
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,724
What happened? Why did you stop the
bus? Your bus breaks down everyday?

449
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,989
Hey girl! Don't you feel ashamed
to hold a man by his collar?

450
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:38,728
What's wrong?
- can't you see?

451
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,993
If the bus broke down,
how is the driver at fault?

452
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:43,335
Keep quiet! Don't interfere.

453
00:55:43,406 --> 00:55:47,001
He stops the bus here everyday.
Knowwhy? Because his wife lives

454
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:52,403
here.
What happened?

455
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:55,006
That girl is lying,
the bus really broke down.

456
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:57,076
He's speaking the truth.
- He's lying.

457
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:08,362
This is not a bus stop.
can I sing here?

458
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:32,386
"If you want to live, laugh away"

459
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:49,995
"Life is very short"

460
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:58,003
"Wonder what will happen tomorrow"

461
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:38,377
"Sorrow and happiness come and go"

462
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:52,992
"Don't let what comes and goes
affect you so much"

463
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:05,938
"If you want to live, laugh away"

464
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:37,970
"Tomorrow is a dream"

465
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:49,390
"Only this moment belongs to us"

466
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:52,985
"Don't lose it"

467
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:05,931
"If you want to live, laugh away"

468
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:40,968
When will the bus move?
- It will take long.

469
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:45,973
My ice will melt.
What will I tell the hotel guy?

470
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:49,379
I'll walk it up.
- can I come with you?

471
00:59:49,986 --> 00:59:52,386
Why ask me?
Is the road my father's?

472
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:56,390
Why are you... Give, I'll carry that.

473
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:02,396
carry this... and this too.

474
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:06,400
I'll carry that... followme.

475
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:09,995
Hurry up!
- Wait, I'm coming.

476
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:13,998
come soon.

477
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:17,012
Ten year old boys in my village
can run carrying that much luggage.

478
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,604
I'm not a 10 year old.
- Shut-up!

479
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:20,004
What is your name?

480
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:25,012
vijay. But people call me viju.
- Why have you come to Balipuram?

481
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:27,750
The new hotel...
- So what if a new hotel has come up?

482
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:30,015
Everyone is rushing here for a job.
Are you married?

483
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:34,029
No, can't find a girl.
- Howwillyou? You don't have a job.

484
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:36,759
What willyou feed her after
marriage?

485
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:39,024
Your tambourine?
Tambourine? Oh, guitar!

486
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:45,439
There's the hotel.
The one who made it must be an ass.

487
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:48,772
He made the hotel so far
in the mountains.

488
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:51,036
All the ice melts
by the time I reach here.

489
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:56,050
You talk too much, viju, walk faster.

490
01:00:57,053 --> 01:01:00,989
Oh yes, it's me who is talking.
I wish even I can get

491
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:04,983
a job in this hotel.
I'm a very good cook.

492
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:07,393
Those who eat it lick fingers.
Yours?

493
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:10,989
- Not mine, their own.
viju, you are a fool.

494
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:12,398
- First an ass, now a fool?
What all she calls me!

495
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,734
It's very cold.
- What?

496
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,998
The ice.
- The ice will be cold, not hot.

497
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,001
We are there.
- I can see.

498
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:27,414
Ice girl, you are very late today.
- Where do I keep this?

499
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,417
On his head!
- Take.

500
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,012
The ice has melted.

501
01:01:32,088 --> 01:01:36,024
Naturally! By the time
I reach here, it melts.

502
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:39,020
Half the ice is in this
gentlemars pants, squeeze it out.

503
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,020
come sir.

504
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:45,033
Mr. vijay!
- Damn!

505
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:47,027
Mr. vijay!
- Who vijay?

506
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:50,038
When did you come?
Boys! come here.

507
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,032
Give.

508
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,445
But sir, what happened
to your clothes?

509
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:02,381
What happened to your car, sir?
- You are the boss?

510
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:04,384
And I made you carry my luggage?

511
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:06,716
That means, I'm dismissed
before getting the job?

512
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:11,392
Don't worry about the job.
If you can cook, you have the job.

513
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:13,393
When do I come?

514
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:17,992
From tomorrow.
- Thank you.

515
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:23,003
Sir, come.
- Yes.

516
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:30,003
The hotel is made well.

517
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:33,341
Where is Sanjay?
- He... he...

518
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:37,409
He left two days ago.
- What! Left?

519
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:39,749
Why didrt you stop him
for the hotel opening?

520
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:43,014
I did sir, but he did not listen.

521
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:49,691
Habit compels him. The lad ran away.
- come.

522
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:04,376
Shabbo! Shabbo, my love!

523
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:12,387
As if your body is not fragrant
enough

524
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:20,986
that you are using perfume.
Shabbo, shall I pullyou close?

525
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:26,401
- Yes.
Shall I hold you in my arms?

526
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:30,997
- Yes.
My darling!

527
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:34,999
Who is it?

528
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:41,739
Who is it?!

529
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:51,015
Who is it!

530
01:03:56,032 --> 01:04:00,366
You bloody dog!
If you come again, I'll shoot you!

531
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:07,365
What happened? Why are you shouting?
- Sir, the dog. The same dog again.

532
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:09,376
He attacked me.
- Which dog?

533
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:13,574
That priest... there is one mad dog
who has made my life miserable.

534
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:15,382
What?
- Ask Shabbo.

535
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:16,574
Yes Mr. vijay.

536
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:33,730
So partner, howwas the journey?
- First class.

537
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:36,995
chhagan Patel is an intelligent man.
He's made a very good hotel.

538
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:39,998
Where is Sanjay?
- Guess.

539
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:43,001
He ran away?
- As usual.

540
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:45,411
You gave him so much money after all.

541
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:48,745
Have you brought the parcel?
- That midi?

542
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:50,417
Yes.
- I brought it.

543
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:54,421
How could I forget?
... Where is she?

544
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:57,356
She's coming for the party
in the evening. You can see her.

545
01:04:57,426 --> 01:05:01,157
Why don't you guys listen to me? I'll
tell boss and get you all dismissed.

546
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,697
As if you rule here.

547
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:06,366
You sell cold ice...
- And have a hot head.

548
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:09,961
Just because boss made you the cook,
you boss over us?

549
01:05:11,707 --> 01:05:14,369
Shut-up!
- What's going on here?

550
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:18,208
Sir, have you appointed me
as a cook here or not?

551
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:21,379
Then why don't they let me cook?
- They won't.

552
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:25,318
What?
- I mean, why don't you? Go inside!

553
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:27,379
Sir, she...
- Didrt you hear? Go!

554
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:34,727
Listen.
- What is it?

555
01:05:34,997 --> 01:05:37,989
Actually, you are the kitchen
captain.

556
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:47,340
- What?
You are the boss of the kitchen. Your

557
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,742
job is to keep an eye on everyone...
not to cook yourself. Understood?

558
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:53,010
- Understood.
Wear these modern clothes

559
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:55,015
for tonight's party.
Why? Do I look bad in these?

560
01:05:55,084 --> 01:05:58,417
- You look beautiful.
But in these clothes,

561
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:02,146
you will look even better.
Listen.

562
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:09,954
come.

563
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:15,369
Hello Mr. Suraj. Hello vijay.

564
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:18,702
congratulations!
- Thank you. You are very late.

565
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,374
Everyone is waiting for you.

566
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:30,976
Mr. Rajendranath, I am your fan.
I have seen your every film.

567
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:33,988
I saw'Jab pyar kisi se hota hai'
25 times.

568
01:06:34,056 --> 01:06:35,717
Only?
- I'll watch it again.

569
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:37,982
come.

570
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:44,990
Mr. Girdharilal!
When did you come to Balipuram?

571
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:50,334
I came today. I heard a new hotel had
opened, so I thought I'll stay here.

572
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:53,739
come. Meet him.
He's Mr. vijay. And he is Mr. Suraj.

573
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,001
Mr. Suraj, he's Mr. Girdharilal.
- Pleased to meet you.

574
01:06:56,078 --> 01:06:59,013
He is the owner of this hotel.

575
01:07:49,665 --> 01:07:53,396
"There's none as handsome as you"

576
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:57,404
"I love none else more than you"

577
01:07:58,007 --> 01:08:01,340
"I have no one but you"

578
01:09:09,945 --> 01:09:13,938
"When I am with you, I glow"

579
01:09:20,356 --> 01:09:24,349
"I find immense solace
coming into your arms"

580
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,953
"They talk silently,
such are your eyes"

581
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:36,369
"Such a star is none else"

582
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:40,968
"There's none as handsome as you"

583
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:50,037
"I got involved with you
and everyone left me"

584
01:10:56,051 --> 01:11:00,044
"I made you my friend,
and the whole world became my enemy"

585
01:11:08,397 --> 01:11:12,390
"I have no support now"

586
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:16,403
"There's none as handsome as you"

587
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:13,378
Havert forgotten me yet, Suraj?

588
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:23,988
You? Over here?

589
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:28,993
Girdharilal is my husband.

590
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:36,409
Your coming here at such
a late hour is improper.

591
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,009
How is your father?

592
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:48,747
To save father's honour, who
owed huge money to people...

593
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:51,424
I had to marry Girdharilal.

594
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:56,421
My father's honour was saved,
but he did not survive.

595
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,424
He died two years ago.

596
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:14,972
Since when did you start drinking?

597
01:14:16,985 --> 01:14:18,714
Willyou heed my advise?

598
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:23,381
Get married;
you will forget everything.

599
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:25,387
Have you?

600
01:14:46,014 --> 01:14:49,415
I'll killyou, you bitch!
... Leave me!

601
01:14:54,022 --> 01:14:57,014
What happened? Sushma, you?

602
01:15:00,362 --> 01:15:03,354
Sushma, over here?
- He is Sushma's husband.

603
01:15:34,396 --> 01:15:38,730
Excuse me. We had booked a room
in the name of Nawab Ashraf Ali.

604
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:39,990
can we take it?

605
01:15:45,407 --> 01:15:49,400
Your voice is so musical.
Your eyes are so enchanting.

606
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:53,013
Your cheeks are so red.
Your nose is so sharp

607
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:59,010
This nose will look so good on 35mm.

608
01:15:59,421 --> 01:16:01,946
These eyes will look so good on 35mm.

609
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:17,363
The 35mm angle from which you were
seeing my wife's nose, eyes, teeth...

610
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:23,969
if I see all those of yours
on 70mm, what will be your state?

611
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:26,981
You'll be in trouble. Understood?

612
01:16:27,983 --> 01:16:30,383
If you didrt understand with words,
I'll explain with my hands.

613
01:16:30,986 --> 01:16:32,385
I understood!
- What?

614
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:45,992
Waiter, showthis man the urinal.

615
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:53,407
Wife, what room have they given us?
- 106.

616
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:56,409
106? It must be a good room.

617
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:45,986
I won't spare you!
- chhagan, wait!

618
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:52,398
Leave me, Shabbo! I won't
spare the priest's dog today!

619
01:17:58,006 --> 01:17:59,735
Where did the rascal go?

620
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:19,350
Why did you kill this dog?
- Sir, it was a mad dog.

621
01:18:19,961 --> 01:18:23,362
Look what he did to me.
He pounced on me even yesterday.

622
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:28,698
That's okay, but this dog cannot
be mad, he's wearing a collar.

623
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:30,961
And then,
why was he always after you?

624
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:34,972
How do I know?
He's an animal, and that too, mad.

625
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:36,374
He can go after anyone.

626
01:18:36,978 --> 01:18:40,709
But whose dog is this?
- Sir, I knowthis dog.

627
01:18:40,982 --> 01:18:43,974
Since this hotel is made,
he used to roam around this hotel.

628
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:48,182
He is Father Benevolent's dog.
- Who Father Benevolent?

629
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,984
He was the priest of Balipuram.

630
01:18:51,993 --> 01:18:55,986
He's no more.
- Abdul, bury this dog.

631
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:43,377
You said we will go to the new hotel,
romance, talk romantic.

632
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:46,379
But what is this?
You have brought me to a jungle.

633
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:48,972
You are always showing me dreams.

634
01:19:49,985 --> 01:19:57,187
I was praying.
Nowl will turn the dreams for real.

635
01:19:57,993 --> 01:20:01,986
Look at the ground, and see the sky.

636
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:06,993
Don't you think we
are hanging in between?

637
01:20:24,019 --> 01:20:27,420
Wife, there's one voice
that's melodious.

638
01:20:28,423 --> 01:20:30,414
And another, that's jarring.

639
01:20:31,026 --> 01:20:33,426
But this yellow cap is bitter gourd.

640
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:36,429
Hurry up! Don't walk so slow.

641
01:20:37,432 --> 01:20:44,031
Hey mister! You look like
a sugarcane bamboo.

642
01:20:44,105 --> 01:20:49,441
I heard you killed a dog last night.

643
01:20:50,045 --> 01:20:53,776
Instead of a dog, you should
have killed a film director...

644
01:20:54,049 --> 01:21:00,045
who eyes the wives of other men,
then you would go to heaven.

645
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:06,986
Why did you stop? come!
Hurry up, they may leave.

646
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:10,988
Keep it in the car.
- Even you are leaving?

647
01:21:11,066 --> 01:21:12,055
Yes.

648
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:14,992
I don't understand why
you all are leaving suddenly.

649
01:21:16,004 --> 01:21:18,996
Sir, your job is done,
we'll look for another contract now.

650
01:21:19,074 --> 01:21:22,407
My wife is not keeping well, so I
thought I'll leave along with them.

651
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:26,412
You want to look for more work,
Lalwani's wife is ill.

652
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:29,415
Alright, as you wish.
- Good bye, sir.

653
01:21:37,025 --> 01:21:42,019
Mr. Suraj, I'm sorry for
what happened last night.

654
01:21:44,432 --> 01:21:50,029
I misunderstood. And you know, when
the

655
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:52,768
husband is old, and the wife young...
one cannot but doubt.

656
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:59,639
If you have really forgiven me,
please dine with us tonight.

657
01:22:00,382 --> 01:22:03,374
Is that necessary?
- I'll be grateful.

658
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:23,997
What happened?
- Some problem with the car.

659
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:31,408
The car had to break down here.

660
01:22:32,013 --> 01:22:35,005
Hurry up! We are stuck in this
tunnel.

661
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:44,415
If the car is giving you trouble
already, howwillyou reach Bombay?

662
01:23:10,385 --> 01:23:11,977
chhagan, what's happening?

663
01:23:36,411 --> 01:23:40,347
Mr. Gupta, what happened?
- It's a land slide.

664
01:23:40,415 --> 01:23:42,007
What?
- A mountain slide.

665
01:23:42,083 --> 01:23:47,020
Oh. But howwill we move it now?
Howwill we leave?

666
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:52,421
We'll go back to the hotel.
I'll get the road cleared tomorrow.

667
01:23:53,428 --> 01:23:55,020
Okay, let's go.

668
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:11,369
Mahendra Prasad Gupta here.
Please give me Mahesh Kumar Lingappa.

669
01:24:12,981 --> 01:24:19,318
I have worked in the municipality
for 15 years.

670
01:24:22,991 --> 01:24:26,392
Mr. Lingappa, Gupta here.

671
01:24:26,995 --> 01:24:31,728
Yes... hello... hello...
- What happened?

672
01:24:33,001 --> 01:24:34,400
The line has got disconnected.

673
01:24:38,006 --> 01:24:39,405
The telephone is dead.

674
01:24:41,009 --> 01:24:45,002
This is too much!
- The road is blocked, the phone

675
01:24:50,018 --> 01:24:52,748
dead.
Nowwhat?

676
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:56,013
- Even the telephone has gone dead.
Looks like you will have

677
01:25:07,969 --> 01:25:12,963
to stay here a few days.
Wife, if we don't get a child

678
01:25:13,575 --> 01:25:16,567
in five years...
we'll take in a dog.

679
01:25:17,979 --> 01:25:19,970
He started barking before
the five years got over.

680
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:29,986
Belong to me.

681
01:25:30,992 --> 01:25:34,393
Looks like chicken Biryani
has affected you badly.

682
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:38,397
I have herbs that a sage gave me.

683
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:43,334
If mixed in water and served to a
girl, she will leave everything...

684
01:25:43,404 --> 01:25:44,996
and come into your arms.

685
01:25:53,014 --> 01:25:56,415
Wow! Beautiful! very beautiful!

686
01:26:01,956 --> 01:26:05,357
Waiter! have you gone deaf?
- coming sir.

687
01:26:07,962 --> 01:26:16,961
It smells divine!
What is this? Dog bone?

688
01:26:17,038 --> 01:26:18,027
Oh God!

689
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:23,975
Have all the shops closed down?
Where did you cook this mutton?

690
01:26:24,112 --> 01:26:28,378
Wife, remember,
these people had killed one dog.

691
01:26:28,983 --> 01:26:31,975
I think they have cooked that dog.
- No sir!

692
01:26:32,987 --> 01:26:36,388
I won't eat this. Hey waiter!
- Yes sir?

693
01:26:37,992 --> 01:26:39,391
Stand close to me.

694
01:26:40,995 --> 01:26:42,986
It's stinking. Go away!

695
01:26:43,998 --> 01:26:45,989
Wife, take care of my cap.

696
01:26:48,002 --> 01:26:51,403
Look, you get liquor here.
We don't drink liquor.

697
01:26:52,006 --> 01:26:55,999
Get a lemon drink for my wife.

698
01:26:59,013 --> 01:27:01,948
Sir, I have got an order to
get a lemon drink for madam.

699
01:27:02,016 --> 01:27:05,349
I'll mix the herbs in it.
Then watch it work!

700
01:27:16,965 --> 01:27:22,369
Madam, your lemon drink.
- I'll catch a cold.

701
01:27:22,971 --> 01:27:26,964
I don't want it.
- The money will go waste.

702
01:27:27,041 --> 01:27:28,975
I'll drink it.

703
01:27:55,003 --> 01:27:56,402
What happened to him?
- Get lost!

704
01:27:56,504 --> 01:27:59,996
Looks like he is dead.
- Damn you!

705
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:04,935
Husband, what happened to you?
Get up, husband!

706
01:28:05,346 --> 01:28:06,938
Don't get up.

707
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:34,965
My Motu, my baby.

708
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:42,973
But you don't love me.

709
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:53,985
Don't leave me! Don't ruin my life.
You belong to me.

710
01:28:54,062 --> 01:28:57,998
You belong to me.
- You belong to me.

711
01:29:01,936 --> 01:29:03,927
Hello sir
- Hello.

712
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:06,933
Popatlal makes us laugh in his
roles in film.

713
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:12,344
come Mr. Patel.
She is my wife, Sushma.

714
01:29:12,947 --> 01:29:16,940
Hello madam,
I think I have seen you somewhere.

715
01:29:17,952 --> 01:29:23,948
We are from Delhi, you are from
Bombay. We could never have met.

716
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:29,964
Why not?
Oh yes! I remember now, madam.

717
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:33,364
I sawyour photo in Bombay,
in Mr. Suraj's cabin.

718
01:29:53,721 --> 01:29:56,986
chhagan, howmuch you talk!
Why can't you sealyour mouth?

719
01:29:57,058 --> 01:30:00,994
Why? I saw Sushma's photo
in sir's room.

720
01:30:01,996 --> 01:30:04,726
Shameless woman!
you lied to me that night.

721
01:30:04,999 --> 01:30:08,400
You told me you got scared seeing
my health and had gone to his room.

722
01:30:09,003 --> 01:30:11,403
Nowl came to know
that he was your lover.

723
01:30:17,011 --> 01:30:19,002
Don't you dare step into my room!

724
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:23,407
Mr. Girdharilal, you are mistaken.
- I was, not any more.

725
01:30:24,018 --> 01:30:25,417
I understand the truth now.

726
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:30,013
The truth is that we were in the
same college, and knew each other.

727
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:31,615
But now...
- You have forgotten each other?

728
01:30:32,026 --> 01:30:35,018
If you had forgotten, you would
not keep this loose womars picture.

729
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:39,025
I only want to tellyou
not to make an issue of this.

730
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:42,035
You mean,
I should not beat your lover?

731
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:46,039
I will! I surely will!
Let me see who stops me.

732
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:53,436
No Suraj!

733
01:30:56,909 --> 01:30:59,309
Wonder what's
happening in this hotel.

734
01:30:59,912 --> 01:31:03,313
First the road got blocked,
then the telephone went dead.

735
01:31:03,916 --> 01:31:05,315
And nowthe lights are out.

736
01:31:05,918 --> 01:31:08,910
Nowmy death may follow.
- Don't be afraid, sir.

737
01:31:13,926 --> 01:31:17,327
How did the lights go out?
- I don't know, the fuse is fine.

738
01:31:22,335 --> 01:31:25,327
I think the whole city has blinked.

739
01:31:25,938 --> 01:31:27,667
Even the telephone is dead.
What do we do?

740
01:31:32,345 --> 01:31:36,338
Strange noises are coming
from the old shed behind the hotel.

741
01:31:36,449 --> 01:31:37,915
Strange noises?
- Yes.

742
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:40,942
Suraj, shall we go and see?
- No, don't go there.

743
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:44,353
Why? What is the matter?
- There is nothing there.

744
01:31:44,957 --> 01:31:45,946
Let's go.

745
01:31:50,963 --> 01:31:52,362
Strange noises in the shed?

746
01:32:03,642 --> 01:32:06,907
The noise is coming from inside.
- But this is locked.

747
01:32:06,979 --> 01:32:09,914
Let's go back.
- Don't talk nonsense. Break the

748
01:32:39,945 --> 01:32:41,936
lock!
How come graveyard crosses are here?

749
01:32:43,949 --> 01:32:47,942
I don't understand. There is surely
something that has been kept from us.

750
01:32:48,354 --> 01:32:54,691
Don't you knowyour hotel
is built on an old graveyard?

751
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:55,892
Graveyard?

752
01:32:56,295 --> 01:33:01,892
A murder is a murder.
It talks some day.

753
01:33:01,967 --> 01:33:05,300
Keep your mouth shut!
Or I'll make you dumb.

754
01:33:06,906 --> 01:33:07,895
Who is it?

755
01:33:14,313 --> 01:33:17,305
What's going on? A meeting?

756
01:33:17,917 --> 01:33:21,318
No sir, not a meeting,
they all are afraid of the dark.

757
01:33:21,921 --> 01:33:23,320
Are they afraid of the dark...

758
01:33:23,422 --> 01:33:26,914
or of the fact that this hotel
is build on a graveyard?

759
01:33:28,928 --> 01:33:32,921
No point arguing with them.
Lalwani, come to the office.

760
01:33:44,944 --> 01:33:51,941
For a moment I felt
they had seen Sanjay's dead body.

761
01:33:52,952 --> 01:33:56,285
Your talks can create
huge problems for us.

762
01:33:58,891 --> 01:34:04,295
Heard that? It's Tiger howling
again

763
01:34:04,396 --> 01:34:06,887
Stop your nonsense!
- You stop your nonsense!

764
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:13,294
Influenced by you,
I cheated the innocent priest.

765
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:18,301
I forgot my duty. Earlier,
when the church bell tolled...

766
01:34:20,312 --> 01:34:22,303
my head would bow.

767
01:34:23,315 --> 01:34:28,912
And now, my heart fears.

768
01:34:29,922 --> 01:34:34,325
Yudi! what is wrong with you?
Gather yourself!

769
01:34:36,128 --> 01:34:40,656
He's calling me.
My Tiger is calling me. Leave me!

770
01:34:40,933 --> 01:34:45,666
Yudi, have you gone mad?
I myself buried that dog.

771
01:34:45,938 --> 01:34:48,668
This is some other dog.
- It is the same dog.

772
01:34:48,941 --> 01:34:50,307
No.
- He is the same dog.

773
01:34:50,342 --> 01:34:55,871
He is! I will prove it to you.
Leave me!

774
01:34:56,282 --> 01:34:58,273
Abdul, leave him!

775
01:37:43,315 --> 01:37:47,308
You are here!
vandana, where were you since

776
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:52,323
morning?
Why didrt you bring my tea?

777
01:37:52,925 --> 01:37:54,324
...What is the matter? You look sad.
I'm missing home.

778
01:37:54,927 --> 01:37:57,259
Missing home at this age?
Have you gone mad?

779
01:37:57,363 --> 01:37:59,854
Then who should I miss at this age?

780
01:38:00,265 --> 01:38:01,857
Shall I tellyou?

781
01:38:05,871 --> 01:38:06,860
Listen!

782
01:38:07,873 --> 01:38:11,866
Where are you going?
No one will come here. Just once...

783
01:38:20,886 --> 01:38:23,616
Looks like...
- Sir...

784
01:38:23,889 --> 01:38:27,882
Managed to woo the ice maiden.
Let's go and see them romance.

785
01:38:27,993 --> 01:38:30,291
"In love, you should never do this"

786
01:38:30,896 --> 01:38:33,296
"You should not fear the world"

787
01:38:33,899 --> 01:38:37,892
"So many hearts have broken"

788
01:38:39,304 --> 01:38:42,296
"And will continue to break"

789
01:38:44,910 --> 01:38:49,904
"UntiI lovers fear the world"

790
01:39:45,904 --> 01:39:52,901
"Like the clouds float in the air"

791
01:39:52,978 --> 01:39:59,850
"Like the birds fly in the sky"

792
01:40:00,853 --> 01:40:03,253
"come, let us move like the wind"

793
01:40:03,355 --> 01:40:05,846
"come, let us move
like a ray of light"

794
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:08,849
"In love... "

795
01:41:09,922 --> 01:41:16,327
"Like a lamp
is not afraid of the dark"

796
01:41:16,929 --> 01:41:22,925
"Lovers are not afraid of emotions"

797
01:41:24,937 --> 01:41:27,667
"Let us bloom like a garden"

798
01:41:27,940 --> 01:41:30,340
"Let us unite like the body and soul"

799
01:41:31,944 --> 01:41:32,933
"In love... "

800
01:42:48,954 --> 01:42:51,354
Someone broke his neck.

801
01:42:51,957 --> 01:42:53,948
But what was Yudi
doing here with the spade?

802
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:56,621
He left to dig the
dog's grave last night.

803
01:42:56,895 --> 01:42:59,295
Why?
- He felt the dog was not dead.

804
01:42:59,398 --> 01:43:01,298
But we all knewthe dog was dead.

805
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:05,631
Sir, why argue?
Let us bury his body.

806
01:43:05,904 --> 01:43:09,305
No, this is a murder.
The police will come and investigate.

807
01:43:09,574 --> 01:43:13,908
But howwill the police come? The
phone is dead, the road is blocked.

808
01:43:14,312 --> 01:43:16,303
They will come, if not today,
tomorrow.

809
01:43:16,915 --> 01:43:19,315
Ramu, take this body
and put it in the shed.

810
01:43:36,334 --> 01:43:39,929
You shaved your moustache
and disgraced your ancestors' honour.

811
01:43:40,338 --> 01:43:44,331
Damn the actor after who
you have gone crazy.

812
01:43:45,343 --> 01:43:51,942
Wife, whatever you have to say,
tell me.

813
01:43:52,017 --> 01:43:55,282
Beat me if you want,
scold me if you like.

814
01:43:55,887 --> 01:43:59,618
But please don't tell him anything.
- I will! I'll say a thousand times.

815
01:43:59,891 --> 01:44:03,622
That jerk ruined my life!

816
01:44:03,895 --> 01:44:12,633
If you say another word about
him, I'll chop off your tongue.

817
01:44:12,904 --> 01:44:17,307
What do I do now!
- You don't do anything.

818
01:44:17,909 --> 01:44:19,900
I will do for my Nath.

819
01:44:20,312 --> 01:44:25,909
I will get dressed and lure him.

820
01:44:36,928 --> 01:44:43,333
My Nath... My Natha!
- Oh my God!

821
01:44:44,936 --> 01:44:51,341
From the swing,
you jumped and sat on the tree.

822
01:44:51,943 --> 01:44:56,880
What are you doing there? come down.
I have brought a cot for both of us.

823
01:44:57,082 --> 01:45:00,210
We will sit on it and romance.

824
01:45:00,285 --> 01:45:03,277
You fatso!
Why are you after me?

825
01:45:03,388 --> 01:45:06,289
Not after, I am belowyou.

826
01:45:06,892 --> 01:45:11,886
Help! Save me!
My honour is at stake!

827
01:45:12,898 --> 01:45:18,894
Oh God! Husband! What are you doing!
Don't do this.

828
01:45:18,970 --> 01:45:27,309
Wife, I may be your husband.
But now, he is my husband.

829
01:45:27,913 --> 01:45:32,316
I will stand below his feet
till I die.

830
01:45:33,919 --> 01:45:38,913
You keep standing below,
I'll stay on the tree.

831
01:45:41,927 --> 01:45:46,330
I don't understand how Yudi died.

832
01:45:47,933 --> 01:45:50,333
Yudi was not killed by a human,
Mr. Kapoor.

833
01:45:50,936 --> 01:45:54,337
I think some ghost has killed him.

834
01:45:54,940 --> 01:45:57,465
Stop your nonsense!
There are no ghosts!

835
01:45:57,876 --> 01:46:00,276
It is our sin that is killing us.

836
01:46:00,478 --> 01:46:04,881
Atleast you admitted
we have committed a sin.

837
01:46:07,285 --> 01:46:10,880
That old priest died because of us.

838
01:46:11,890 --> 01:46:13,881
Don't talk nonsense!

839
01:46:14,893 --> 01:46:18,624
Stupid! Howmany
more days would he live?

840
01:46:18,897 --> 01:46:20,489
The old man was going to die anyway.

841
01:46:20,899 --> 01:46:23,891
You are saying that,
but ask your conscience.

842
01:46:23,969 --> 01:46:26,301
Did the priest die his own death?

843
01:47:57,862 --> 01:47:58,851
What's happening!

844
01:48:29,294 --> 01:48:32,286
Why are you all shouting?
What is the matter?

845
01:48:32,897 --> 01:48:36,298
Why this hullabaloo, chhagan?
- But how did you come in?

846
01:48:36,901 --> 01:48:38,892
There was a cupboard before the door.

847
01:48:53,918 --> 01:48:56,853
Are you dreaming?
- This is not a dream.

848
01:48:57,856 --> 01:49:02,054
It's a fact. I saw it.
We all saw it!

849
01:49:02,861 --> 01:49:08,857
He will kill me... he will kill me!
- Lalwani! Lalwani, controlyourself!

850
01:49:08,933 --> 01:49:10,867
Let me go!

851
01:51:50,962 --> 01:51:53,692
I don't want to die.
... I don't want to die!

852
01:51:53,965 --> 01:51:57,901
Stop weeping!
- Scream! Scream even louder!

853
01:51:58,903 --> 01:52:01,303
Even I got influenced by
a fiend like you.

854
01:52:01,906 --> 01:52:06,309
I never lied in life.
Never did anything illegal.

855
01:52:07,011 --> 01:52:08,911
But you ruined me!

856
01:52:10,114 --> 01:52:12,912
I only worry for my children.

857
01:52:14,252 --> 01:52:18,313
Why did I do this?
I will never see them.

858
01:52:18,923 --> 01:52:23,326
Never see them.
- You trapped me too in your net.

859
01:52:23,928 --> 01:52:27,921
'Gupta, do you eat, or drink? '

860
01:52:28,933 --> 01:52:31,663
Gupta is dying now!
- Don't talk nonsense!

861
01:52:31,936 --> 01:52:34,336
I did not keep a gun
on your temple and make you work.

862
01:52:34,939 --> 01:52:37,134
Whatever you did
was of your own will.

863
01:52:37,342 --> 01:52:38,673
What have you done of your own will?

864
01:52:39,344 --> 01:52:42,336
You cheated Father Benevolent and
got a double agreement signed?

865
01:52:43,348 --> 01:52:47,284
Sir, you have no right to complain.
You asked me to make the hotel...

866
01:52:47,352 --> 01:52:48,341
I made it.

867
01:52:48,453 --> 01:52:53,356
chhagan Patel! I got you the contract
to make a hotel, not to cheat.

868
01:52:53,958 --> 01:52:57,894
Don't get abusive, sir.
In what way did I cheat you?

869
01:52:57,962 --> 01:53:00,294
Tell me, how did I cheat you?

870
01:53:00,898 --> 01:53:03,298
What's the big deal if
I made the hotel over a graveyard?

871
01:53:03,401 --> 01:53:05,892
There are so many such graveyards
over which hotels and homes are made.

872
01:54:21,112 --> 01:54:23,307
I don't understand what's going on.

873
01:54:24,315 --> 01:54:29,912
First D'souza died, then Yudi,
then Lalwani.

874
01:54:30,922 --> 01:54:33,914
And now, Kapoor.
- It is all a curse of nature.

875
01:54:35,326 --> 01:54:39,922
When sinners escape law,
nature punishes them.

876
01:54:40,932 --> 01:54:45,335
And I think nature is
behind all these incidents.

877
01:54:45,937 --> 01:54:48,337
Only nature, no one else.

878
01:55:59,877 --> 01:56:00,866
It was just a mirror.

879
01:56:11,289 --> 01:56:14,884
If you care so much for your life,
go outside!

880
01:56:16,894 --> 01:56:19,886
Let me stay here.
I'm afraid to go out.

881
01:56:20,231 --> 01:56:23,223
chhagan, let him be!
He's already half dead.

882
01:56:23,301 --> 01:56:27,897
Shut-up! The idiot is scared himself,
and is scaring others too.

883
01:56:28,906 --> 01:56:32,899
Get out of here!
- No chhagan! Shabbo!

884
01:56:34,912 --> 01:56:36,311
Get out, you rascal!

885
01:57:08,279 --> 01:57:09,268
Ghost!

886
01:58:08,873 --> 01:58:12,866
What happened? Why are you shouting?
- This ghost will kill me.

887
01:58:13,277 --> 01:58:15,871
Keep this door closed.
- What's happening?

888
01:58:15,947 --> 01:58:18,882
chhagan, there is a
ghost in this cellar.

889
01:58:18,950 --> 01:58:19,939
Ghost?

890
01:58:21,285 --> 01:58:23,879
Shabbo, get nails and a hammer,
quick!

891
01:58:39,904 --> 01:58:42,304
What happened?
Why did you seal this door?

892
01:58:42,907 --> 01:58:45,307
Gupta said there is a ghost inside.
So we sealed the door.

893
01:58:45,910 --> 01:58:46,899
Rubbish!

894
01:58:48,913 --> 01:58:52,314
No Mr. Suraj, don't open the door.
There is really a ghost inside.

895
01:58:53,317 --> 01:58:56,844
There is a ghost inside!
I saw it myself. Ghost!

896
01:59:01,258 --> 01:59:03,852
Have you gone mad? Are you all crazy?

897
01:59:04,862 --> 01:59:07,262
You killed an innocent man because
of your fear and foolishness.

898
01:59:09,867 --> 01:59:14,270
No, that's impossible!

899
01:59:14,872 --> 01:59:19,275
Let me go... let me go.

900
01:59:32,890 --> 01:59:34,881
What have I got into!

901
01:59:37,895 --> 01:59:39,886
I'll never come to this hotel again.

902
01:59:50,908 --> 01:59:54,309
Who am I?
- A bull!

903
01:59:55,846 --> 02:00:03,582
No, not bull, I am your beloved.
- Leave me!

904
02:00:03,854 --> 02:00:05,583
I will not leave you.
- Leave me!

905
02:00:05,856 --> 02:00:11,192
I met you after so many days.
You are my beloved, I will kiss you.

906
02:00:11,262 --> 02:00:14,254
My sweet fat pie!

907
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:34,874
You idiot!
What are you doing in my lap?

908
02:00:35,286 --> 02:00:37,880
I am sitting in your lap
since four days.

909
02:00:38,089 --> 02:00:42,617
I had said if I don't get a baby
in five years...

910
02:00:42,893 --> 02:00:45,293
I'll take a diseased dog in my lap.

911
02:00:45,896 --> 02:00:48,296
Willyou get up,
or do I make you?

912
02:00:48,966 --> 02:00:52,902
If I make you get up,
you'll have a problem.

913
02:00:53,304 --> 02:00:54,896
Get up!
- I'll get up.

914
02:00:55,906 --> 02:00:59,307
The idiot! Hey, where's my moustache?

915
02:00:59,910 --> 02:01:07,316
Husband, why do you worry about
a moustache? It will grow again.

916
02:01:08,919 --> 02:01:13,913
Thank God a million times
for saving our family honour.

917
02:01:27,938 --> 02:01:33,934
Sushma, can't our
old times come back?

918
02:01:46,957 --> 02:01:49,357
What is the matter, Partner?
You are very quiet today.

919
02:01:49,960 --> 02:01:52,292
Just like that.
Today is Sanjay's birthday.

920
02:01:52,363 --> 02:01:55,298
And every year, wherever he is,
he surely comes to take my blessing.

921
02:01:55,900 --> 02:01:58,300
But he won't be able to come today,
the road is blocked.

922
02:02:04,909 --> 02:02:09,312
vandana, where did you find this?
- Here, it was lying in the shrubs.

923
02:02:09,914 --> 02:02:12,644
This belongs to Sanjay.
- A gentleman had come here.

924
02:02:12,917 --> 02:02:17,911
Fair, tall, just like you.
I'd seen him play this.

925
02:02:18,923 --> 02:02:22,916
Suraj, Sanjay loves this so much,
he cannot leave it here and go.

926
02:02:23,928 --> 02:02:25,657
Maybe it fell from his pocket

927
02:02:29,333 --> 02:02:30,322
No Suraj.

928
02:02:32,937 --> 02:02:38,341
chhagan, can I come in?
- You have come here again!

929
02:02:38,943 --> 02:02:41,673
chhagan, let him come.
- Shut-up!

930
02:02:41,946 --> 02:02:45,677
You shut-up! UntiI today,
you spoke and I listened.

931
02:02:45,950 --> 02:02:47,941
Nowl will speak, and you will
listen.

932
02:02:48,953 --> 02:02:53,287
Don't scream! I supported you always.
I always said and did what you

933
02:02:53,958 --> 02:02:57,621
wanted.
But where did you bring me?

934
02:02:57,895 --> 02:03:01,626
In this jungle of fear...
where, in the bright of day,

935
02:03:01,899 --> 02:03:05,300
you hear scary screams...
and in the dark of night,

936
02:03:05,903 --> 02:03:07,894
you see deadly faces of death.
chhagan Patel, that day...

937
02:03:09,907 --> 02:03:11,397
- Shut-up!
You bitch!

938
02:03:19,917 --> 02:03:26,322
Mouth organ! It's the same organ!
Sanjay used to play it!

939
02:03:50,347 --> 02:03:52,941
Sanjay, I did not do anything.

940
02:03:54,351 --> 02:03:57,286
Sanjay, I did not do anything!

941
02:03:58,289 --> 02:04:00,280
Mr. vijay, you!

942
02:04:08,299 --> 02:04:11,291
Where is Sanjay? Where is he?!

943
02:04:11,902 --> 02:04:14,302
I don't know. Ask him.

944
02:04:16,907 --> 02:04:18,898
chhagan, where is my brother?

945
02:04:19,910 --> 02:04:21,309
He left from here.

946
02:04:23,914 --> 02:04:25,905
Where is Sanjay?
- Sir, I don't know.

947
02:04:27,918 --> 02:04:29,317
Tell me where Sanjay is!

948
02:04:32,656 --> 02:04:36,922
Tell me, where is Sanjay?
- I said I don't know.

949
02:04:36,994 --> 02:04:41,328
Wait! I'll tellyou where Sanjay is.

950
02:04:43,934 --> 02:04:45,333
Where is he?
- Inside.

951
02:04:56,880 --> 02:04:57,869
Where is my brother?

952
02:05:01,285 --> 02:05:05,881
Under the ground
where you are standing.

953
02:05:06,890 --> 02:05:10,291
What nonsense are you talking!
- I'm speaking the truth.

954
02:05:10,894 --> 02:05:13,294
Sanjay is dead. He's dead!
- No!

955
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:24,901
No... no! My brother cannot die.
No Suraj, my brother cannot die.

956
02:05:25,909 --> 02:05:30,903
No! Suraj, our Sanjay is here.

957
02:05:30,981 --> 02:05:35,645
No Sanjay, you cannot leave me

958
02:05:35,919 --> 02:05:36,908
and go. Suraj, leave me!
vijay, controlyourself!

959
02:05:38,922 --> 02:05:44,326
I won't spare you!
You betrayer! You betrayed me!

960
02:05:45,929 --> 02:05:48,921
Speak, you bitch!

961
02:05:49,933 --> 02:05:52,333
You betrayed chhagan Patel!

962
02:07:06,276 --> 02:07:14,274
See Suraj! I told you my brother
comes to meet me on this day.

963
02:07:15,285 --> 02:07:18,880
Look, my Sanjay has come to meet me.

964
02:07:23,894 --> 02:07:29,389
It's your birthday today.
Wort you seek my blessings?

965
02:07:30,901 --> 02:07:35,895
Why don't you speak?
Wort you seek my blessings?

966
02:07:36,907 --> 02:07:38,898
Wort you?

967
02:07:43,914 --> 02:07:47,907
Sanjay, I swear by you...

968
02:07:48,919 --> 02:07:53,322
the one who has take your life,
I won't spare his life!

969
02:07:54,324 --> 02:07:55,848
I won't spare him!

970
02:09:36,293 --> 02:09:38,887
Even I will come with you.
- Leave!

971
02:11:08,919 --> 02:11:13,913
I don't want to die!
I want to live!

972
02:11:24,935 --> 02:11:27,927
Spare me! I don't want to die.

973
02:11:31,341 --> 02:11:33,935
I have children, a wife!

974
02:11:36,947 --> 02:11:41,941
I want to live.
I have a small family.

975
02:11:42,352 --> 02:11:48,348
I want to live with them.
I don't want to die. I...

976
02:12:25,929 --> 02:12:28,329
No... no!

977
02:14:02,292 --> 02:14:05,284
Help!

978
02:15:41,925 --> 02:15:42,914
Look!

979
02:15:50,934 --> 02:15:53,334
You reap as you sow.

980
02:15:56,873 --> 02:16:00,866
vijay, it will be better if we
turn this hotel into an orphanage.

981
02:16:01,878 --> 02:16:05,871
So that Father Benevolent's
soul may find peace.

982
02:16:20,897 --> 02:16:23,297
Sir, the tunnel road has opened.

983
02:16:26,903 --> 02:16:29,895
Mr. Suraj, you have done a great
favour to these orphans...

984
02:16:29,973 --> 02:16:32,908
by turning your hotel
into an orphanage.

985
02:16:37,313 --> 02:16:38,302
come Sushma.

986
02:16:52,262 --> 02:16:54,321
Wort you take me home?

987
02:16:57,867 --> 02:16:58,856
come.

988
02:16:59,269 --> 02:17:02,261
"If you want to live, laugh away"

989
02:17:07,877 --> 02:17:11,278
"Life is very short"

990
02:17:16,286 --> 02:17:19,881
"Wonder what will happen tomorrow"
