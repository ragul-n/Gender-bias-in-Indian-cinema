1
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,307
Today's headlines are...

2
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:54,041
Home Minister Mr. Bhavani Shankar
was abducted by the terrorist...

3
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:59,109
of the Liberation force when he
was on his way back from a meeting.

4
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:05,050
The terrorists demand release
of 3 of theirs within 24 hours.

5
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:10,328
They are in jail. Else
the Home Minister will be killed.

6
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:15,325
The Cabinet Ministers have decided
to give into the terrorist's demands

7
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:19,127
& release the jailed terrorists in
order to save the Minister's life.

8
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,741
Long live!
Liberation force!!

9
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:28,850
Long live!
Mr. Bhavani Shankar!

10
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,026
You are just great,
Mr. Bhavani Shankar!

11
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,200
There is no other greater player
than you in the game of politics.

12
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,297
Wow! What a
diabolical move you made.

13
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,939
First, you spread terror in the
city and shook up the Ministry.

14
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:44,134
And then, you handed over
yourself to the terrorists...

15
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,345
and gained the
favours of the people.

16
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,204
Now, nothing can stop you
from becoming a Chief Minister.

17
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:54,553
Well Master, how did you find
the cricket match of my politics?

18
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:58,057
l bowled over the C.M.'s
seat in the first ball itself.

19
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,223
l see, you are
too excited about it.

20
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,222
But, don't you
forget my dear disciple;...

21
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:06,565
politics is like
a one day cricket match.

22
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,561
Sometimes, one can't know who
the winner is until the last ball.

23
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,370
Get lost!
- Sir...

24
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,573
Our plan flopped.
- What?

25
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,705
All those terrorists
we had arrested...

26
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,240
has been gunned
down by A.C.P. Suraj.

27
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:27,576
N O...
Damn you! What are you for?

28
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:32,581
Look at me! l alone am
handling the entire state.

29
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,586
And you... You couldn't
even handle one officer!

30
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,592
Shame on you!
- lt is not easy to stop a man...

31
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,597
who has gained favours of
the C.M. and the l.G.

32
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,270
And, it's not that easy to
become a C.M. also, get it!

33
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:51,405
Even the best of men faces
defeat in the simplest of games.

34
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:58,417
You have seen just one part
of me and not the whole me.

35
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:02,177
l assure you,
l will be the Chief Minister...

36
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:07,422
Even if it takes me to
shed his blood, l shall do so.

37
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,223
What are you doing?
- You be quiet!

38
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:13,228
Today, the whole world
is talking about you.

39
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,401
l am just making sure
nothing bad happens to you.

40
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,432
Brother, why don't you say something?
- What she did was absolutely right.

41
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,296
Mr. Mayor is here.

42
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,205
Hello sir...
- Hello...

43
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,637
Welcome sir.

44
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:27,039
Mr. Mayor, you are visiting
us after a very long time.

45
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,979
Your brother's glorious
accomplishments pulled us here.

46
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,317
Congratulations!

47
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,312
What you did was great.

48
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:37,656
You single-handed dealt with
those dangerous terrorists...

49
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:41,255
Weren't you afraid?
- Be afraid and you are dead!

50
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,462
My uncle is a brave man.

51
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,328
Naughty boy!
- Son, your father is no less.

52
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,993
He fights with his pen
if not with a pistol.

53
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:52,802
Many great leaders
are afraid of him...

54
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,270
lest he might reveal their
true side in the papers.

55
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,348
The Chief Minister
wants to speak to you.

56
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,691
Your valour has won my favours.

57
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:16,687
Keep up your fight against the
traitors & l'll be with you.

58
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:36,374
Don't move! All of you,
gather up over here!

59
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,048
Come on...
Hurry up!

60
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,414
You think you could
kill our men and celebrate!

61
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:45,385
What did you think?
We would let you go off so easily!

62
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,824
We will kill
your entire family.

63
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,330
Let go of me!
l say, let go of me...

64
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:04,006
l won't spare you!
l will kill you...

65
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:08,411
l won't leave you...
What do you think of yourself?

66
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:11,383
l shan't leave you...

67
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,490
YOU!
- Yes, it's me...

68
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,426
ls this a time for pranks?
- Nope but...

69
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:25,355
this is the time when
l should be romancing with you.

70
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:32,561
Knock it off!
Everyone is waiting for us outside.

71
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,436
Let's go.

72
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,570
Was it you, Neha?
- Yup!

73
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,307
Scared you, didn't l? l bet
you were all shaking with fear.

74
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:43,373
Who is she?
- She is Suraj's fiance.

75
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:45,374
Now, what do l tell you sir?

76
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,586
She is the daughter of
our lawyer, Mr. Mehta.

77
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,583
He too is no less.

78
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,583
Well, scared you, didn't l?

79
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:58,456
You naughty boy!
Let me get my hands on you...

80
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,841
Here you go!
- What is it?

81
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,184
Let me have one more, please?
- Have you got any money with you?

82
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,850
No, l don't.
- Sorry... No bucks, no booze.

83
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:30,983
Let me have some booze, please!

84
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,190
Let me have a bottle.
Let me have some booze, please...

85
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,792
Get lost, will you?
- Please let me have the booze...

86
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,468
Son, let me have the booze...

87
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,366
First promise me that you
will marry your daughter to me.

88
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:55,873
l promise. But, you will give me
the booze every day, won't you?

89
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,875
Pop-in-law, you can
swim in it the whole day.

90
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:02,617
l'll give you so much
you can never imagine.

91
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,546
Hear me, brethren!

92
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:09,819
l swear on the booze that,...

93
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:17,565
l shall wed my daughter
to this man and no one else.

94
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,001
Who the hell is it?

95
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,038
Who the hell am l?
- Rajnikant...

96
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,908
That's right!
Rajni is my guru; my mentor!

97
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,910
Damn you!
- How dare you curse me!

98
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:38,052
No son!
He didn't curse you.

99
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:44,256
What he said in Tamil
actually means, ''Do you know?''

100
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:45,925
Come out.

101
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:50,732
What's up, man? Are you trying
to cut the deal...

102
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,071
with my fiance's
father for his daughter?

103
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:59,272
You are in a lot of trouble, man!
- We will see about that.

104
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:11,618
l finally got a chance
to fight in my guru's style.

105
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,643
Hey Bachcha Thakur
or whoever you are...

106
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:44,715
Come out so that l may kick your...

107
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:47,985
Damn you, Rajnikant!
Where the hell are you?

108
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,724
Who said that?
- Got to get to the market & he's...

109
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,124
Oh no...
Rani is here...

110
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,101
l'll deal with you later.
Right now, l have to hurry.

111
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,131
Anthony, did he come by?

112
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,997
He was making trouble over here
just now. He fled when he saw you.

113
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,671
He always gets into trouble
whenever l have to go to the market.

114
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,909
Hey you! Couldn't you find a better
place to go to early in the morning?

115
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:11,082
Aren't you ashamed
of yourself to waste...

116
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,218
your daughter's hard earned
money on booze? - Shut up!

117
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:17,685
lt's not your money but, my
to-be son-in-law who is treating me.

118
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,357
Today, l have finally managed
to ask for you hand in marriage.

119
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:28,025
Do you really need my hand so badly?
- l do...

120
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,368
Oh you do...
Then, take this!

121
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,770
Hope that satisfies you.

122
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:38,709
You will pay for this
and so will your boyfriend.

123
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,943
When it's time to go to the
market, she is strolling about.

124
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,239
Have l no otherjob than to
deliver her chicks to the market?

125
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,518
Do l look like a freebie?

126
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,384
What's up, girl?
Why so late?

127
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:56,385
Oh my! Don't you know my vehicle
is in great demand in the market?

128
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,957
You jerk!
Don't you act too smart with me.

129
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:01,632
No need to tell me what you are.

130
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,835
Now move!
lt's stifling in here.

131
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:09,203
How can you just walk away
leaving me stranded?

132
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,074
ls it really necessary for you to
keep on clucking like your chicks?

133
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:15,572
See... l bet, even your
chicks don't talk like that...

134
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,749
to their roosters
the way you talk to me.

135
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,077
Listen to me...
l am already too late.

136
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,079
Better get moving else,
l will lose my head.

137
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,217
Only if you have one.

138
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,786
First pay me up and only then
will l deliver your goods.

139
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,588
My... that's hot!
- What happened?

140
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:37,926
l burnt my hand.
Babe, you are so hot.

141
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:41,700
You will be a
great comfort in the winter.

142
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,440
Don't need to buy a heater.
- Cut it out!

143
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,106
Come and get it!

144
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,316
Pick the black or pick the white.
Pick whatever you find right...

145
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:54,577
Buy it; boil it; grill it up,
You won't find a better bargain.

146
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:59,619
Hey uncle, how about having one?
You will enjoy it, l promise.

147
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:04,453
No way!
- Now, go inside and have a feast.

148
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,465
Damn you!
lt's all because of you.

149
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,132
All because you were late, people
have already done their shopping.

150
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,129
You ruined my business.

151
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:17,466
Why blow up your top on me if you
don't know the art of doing business?

152
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,711
You telling me l don't know how to
run my business?

153
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:21,846
No, you don't.
- l bet you can't sell even one chicken

154
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,674
ls that a challenge?
- Yes, it is.

155
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:26,475
Darling, l bet ya... lf l don't
clean up your pen in 10 minutes...

156
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:29,082
you may shave off my head clean
and take me around the market.

157
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,949
lf that is so then, go ahead and do it.
- Then go.

158
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,083
Hi aunt, how are you?
- l am fine.

159
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,023
Wow! Guava!

160
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:55,509
Come and get it!
Buy one get one free!

161
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,514
Chickens...

162
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:01,516
Hesitate and you will lose it.
Hasten and you will be love it.

163
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:05,320
Come and get it!
Both young and old... Hot and cold

164
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:08,524
Grab the opportunity
of the life time.

165
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:12,853
Uncle, would you like one?
- Hey girl, is what he says right?

166
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:14,256
Absolutely.

167
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,865
Will it really be that good?
- You will love it.

168
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,070
Let me have one.
- Me three...

169
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,532
l want ten...
- This old man wants ten! Wow!

170
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:27,200
You too take it...
Now, go... She is right there.

171
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,881
l bought two. Let me have four.
- Let me have six. - Me ten.

172
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,877
She won't kiss you;
she will kick you.

173
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,122
l bought ten.
Let me have twenty.

174
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:42,350
Hey old man,
what the hell do you want?

175
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,718
A kiss!

176
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,223
Kiss!
- That's right.

177
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:47,160
What nonsense! Get lost
before l kick you in your back.

178
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:50,563
My darling!
How dare you challenge me.

179
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:52,563
Take a look at this.

180
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:56,240
Buy a chicken and the girl sitting
next door will give you two kisses.

181
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:01,906
Damn you!
Now, you shall pay for it.

182
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:06,380
Good God...
- l shan't spare you today...

183
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:10,918
Darling, don't beat me.
- l shan't leave you.

184
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:16,583
You can run but you can't hide.

185
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,703
Mom... lf anyone asks
for me, l am not at home.

186
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,767
What happened?
Atleast tell me what happened?

187
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:31,136
l can't hide in here. l'd
better hide behind this cot. Shhh...

188
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:34,612
Where the hell are you?
You can't escape me now.

189
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,609
Whom are you looking for?
- Your son.

190
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,612
What did he do?
- You are asking me!

191
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,412
That rascal put up
a banner before my shop that,...

192
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:43,883
l will give two kisses
to whoever purchases my chicken.

193
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:48,422
That's right.
- Mom... She's gone crazy.

194
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:52,027
How dare you do that to
my to be daughter-in-law.

195
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:56,293
Don't beat me, mom!
l am your son...

196
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,304
What's that?
Haven't you even kissed your wife?

197
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,971
That's right. But, it's been
five years since your marriage.

198
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:05,435
What do l say?

199
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:08,805
The day of my marriage,
my wife became the sub-inspector.

200
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,324
Don't you know how strict l
am regarding the discipline?

201
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,670
Everyone saluted me.
Why didn't you salute me?

202
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:36,005
Everyone else are mere constables.

203
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,676
But me,... l am not only
a constable but your husband too.

204
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:41,342
And, have you ever heard of
a husband ever saluting his wife?

205
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:43,681
His duty is to love her.

206
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,347
Where is your baton?
- l left is at home.

207
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:52,351
Then, what the heck
are you doing over here?

208
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:54,692
Don't you know you should
always carry your baton?

209
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:59,356
Now go home. You have to
do all the household chores.

210
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:01,698
How dare my wife
makes me do uxorial duties.

211
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,868
And, how dare you do a men's job.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

212
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,699
Where is Suraj?
- He hasn't reported in yet.

213
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,704
But, who are you?
- l am betrothed to him.

214
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,209
lt's okay.

215
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,186
Here, have some sweets.

216
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,520
Take it!
You too...

217
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:33,129
What's the occasion?
- Actually, l am pregnant.

218
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:36,732
But, you are not even married.

219
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:40,399
So what?
We already had our honeymoon.

220
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:43,536
We planned to get married later.
- Well done!

221
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:47,404
l know. Take this and
distribute it amongst them.

222
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:50,815
When Suraj comes in, tell
him l am waiting in his room.

223
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:55,752
Did you see that? They are going
to have a baby before marriage.

224
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,419
lt's been five years since our
marriage and no good news yet.

225
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:08,758
Congratulations sir...
- What about?

226
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:12,433
You are going to be a father.
- Oh really!... What nonsense!

227
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:15,364
Your girl-friend said so.
She even gave us sweets.

228
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,542
She is waiting for
you in your cabin.

229
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:22,371
Aren't you ashamed of yourself
to play such a dirty prank?

230
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:25,282
What the hell was all that about?

231
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:28,308
l wasn't lying.
You are going to be a father.

232
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:32,354
lf you don't believe me then,
listen to your son yourself.

233
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,455
Daddy...
- Hey... What the hell is that?

234
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,188
Do you want to go
into your father's arms?

235
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,398
Yes, l do.

236
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,593
Did you see that? He so
much want to go into your arms.

237
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,801
Take care of your baby.

238
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,472
This is my baby!
l'll get you for this...

239
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,807
Hey... How come you
are out of your pen?

240
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,147
Come to me...

241
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:59,145
Stop... Where are you going?

242
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,325
Where the hell did you go?

243
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:16,163
So, here you are!

244
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:24,131
l caught you!
- Let go of me!

245
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:31,639
Rani, hold your game tight.

246
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:35,186
YOU! Aren't you ashamed
of yourself to do this?

247
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:38,852
Hey...
What's there to be ashamed of?

248
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,849
You are betrothed to me.
l can do what l wish with you.

249
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:46,387
l can even kiss you.
- Dream on!

250
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:48,529
Which girl in her
right mind want to marry you?

251
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,531
Have you ever looked at yourself?

252
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,203
Why does she always
push me away and walk off?

253
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,533
Where do you think you are going?

254
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:59,898
Watch where you are going, man?

255
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:08,901
What is it? - How dare you
roam around with my to-be wife?

256
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:12,577
Don't you know her father
promised her hand to me?

257
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,909
Take a walk!
You want to marry me!

258
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,321
Even my chickens
won't marry a man like you.

259
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:22,055
Hey... did you hear what she said?
Now, go... Get lost!

260
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:28,257
You are the major
bone of contention for me.

261
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,931
lt's about time
l took care of you.

262
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:45,476
l'll kill you!
- This has gone far enough!

263
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:49,550
Leave me!
- l shan't leave you!

264
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:57,294
Let go of me!
- Take him away!!

265
00:34:57,628 --> 00:35:00,961
Take a walk! - Shut up!
Why did you have to pick a fight?

266
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:03,300
Who me?
Rani... you say the truth.

267
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:06,865
That's right mom! He for no
apparent reason butted in our affair.

268
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,103
Until and unless you
both are not married,...

269
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,967
these things will keep
on happening to you.

270
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:13,303
l am going to the priest right
now to fix your wedding date.

271
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:17,978
Marriage! Oh my!
Let go of me!

272
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:31,321
Mom...
- God bless you both.

273
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:33,822
Now, take the blessings
from the bride's father.

274
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:38,335
Take care of this.
That's all right.

275
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:42,671
God bless you both.
May you live happily ever after.

276
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,847
You look so beautiful!

277
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:54,351
Oh my!
You are going too fast.

278
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:58,355
l am really scared.
- And, why's that.

279
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:02,685
'Cause, this is my first marriage.
l know nothing.

280
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,358
Don't you worry now.
l know everything.

281
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:10,356
ls this your second marriage?
- What did you just said?

282
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:15,361
l had already gathered the all
information from my married friends.

283
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:20,703
ls that so? Well then
tell me, what do we do first?

284
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:25,542
First, put out the lights.
- You got it boss.

285
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:31,388
And then? What's next?
- l can't talk about that.

286
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:33,790
Do tell me what happens next?

287
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:37,792
And then... A chill runs
down the spine like lighting.

288
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:42,528
My, that was loud!
What next?

289
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,835
And then, the whole body
is ignited with passion.

290
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:48,728
lf this keeps on going
then, l am sure,...

291
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,141
very soon our
hut will be on fire.

292
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:55,742
Help!
Catch the thief!

293
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:58,210
Who the hell is that?

294
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,686
How dare he rob a poor man's hut?

295
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:13,820
No...

296
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:00,263
Hello...
- Welcome brother.

297
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,611
Hello Mr. Home Minister.
Please do come in.

298
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:18,610
Just a minute sir.

299
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,347
This way sir.

300
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:25,088
Brother Arun, l liked your
article in the Nav Bharat.

301
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:29,285
This way sir. Let me
introduce you to my wife, Lata.

302
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,423
Hello.
- Hello.

303
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:41,298
Hello lnspector!
- How are you, Madam Chanda?

304
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,436
l am fine.
Long time no see.

305
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:46,802
Can't help it. My hands are
full with the cops and crooks.

306
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:50,643
Have we anything new this time?
- l had to after you called me up.

307
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:53,643
These are the latest goods.
Pick whatever you like best.

308
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,645
My... my...

309
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:02,248
lt is very
fortunate for us that...

310
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:06,322
the Home Minister has presided on
the 10th anniversary of the ashram.

311
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:11,661
Now, the girls
of our ashram...

312
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:15,005
will greet our honorable
Chief guest with flowers.

313
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:26,478
What is your name?
Pretty name.

314
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:39,496
And now, l request our honorable
Chief guest to say a few words.

315
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:48,695
Good evening! l deeply thank the
Mayor, the chairman of this ashram...

316
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:55,100
to having called me
here and meet such beauties.

317
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:59,705
Looking at these budding
flowers makes me feel as if...

318
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:06,717
l have walked into
some garden and not an ashram.

319
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:10,888
ln these revolutionized times,...

320
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:13,029
there is no difference
between a man and a woman.

321
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:17,091
No difference at all.
There is but a physical difference.

322
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:21,329
l am glad to see how fast the women
of our society are making progress.

323
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:24,002
l want them
to keep up the pace...

324
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,938
and show to the world they
are no less than a man.

325
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:34,750
l promise to protect the
honour of all the women kind.

326
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:40,757
The Minister has fallen for that
girl. Send her over in the evening.

327
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:44,761
l shan't do it.
- Oh yeah!

328
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:48,765
You wouldn't want me to open my
mouth to your husband, would you?

329
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:57,096
l can't sleep without having
women and wine before bedtime.

330
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,441
Your woman is here.

331
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:13,785
Welcome dear.
- Good evening!

332
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:16,459
You swept me off my feet
as soon as l saw you.

333
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,063
Let go of me!

334
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:24,935
You lied to me and brought
me here to do this dirty work!

335
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:27,797
Nothing dirty about it.
This is the right path to progress.

336
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:32,164
You don't know what he can
do for you if you appease him.

337
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:35,478
You are a Mayor's wife
and you do this dirty work!

338
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:37,609
Don't forget that
you too are a woman.

339
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:39,815
Come to me, dear.

340
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:44,820
My, you are too shy
about all this, aren't you?

341
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:47,817
Well actually, it's your
first night, that's why.

342
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:51,089
l guess, l can manage her alone.
You two may leave. - Okay!

343
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:53,057
l'll take care of her.

344
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:55,832
Come to me...
- No...

345
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,838
Come on now..

346
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:04,336
Let go of me!

347
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:08,572
Let go...
- Shut up!

348
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:28,657
l enjoyed it.
Get up now!

349
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:43,345
Oh no!
She's dead!

350
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:47,142
Hey D.l.G.!
- What happened?

351
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,885
Look at her; she's dead.

352
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:56,292
Get rid of her.

353
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,899
Those savages! l can't imagine the law
makers and the law enforcers could...

354
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,227
do something so despicable. Such
people should be flogged in public.

355
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:09,435
l can't believe the woman...

356
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:13,905
l so lovingly made my wife
would besmirch my honour.

357
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:16,476
Doesn't matter if
l have to face disgrace,...

358
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,444
l shall see that these
perpetrators are behind bars.

359
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:24,083
l am Mayor Chandraprakash speaking.
ls the Chief Minister in?

360
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:26,719
He is not. He has gone to
Rajgarh for an urgent meeting.

361
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:32,325
Yes! - We will
leave for Rajgarh rightaway.

362
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:34,597
Let us show this
cassette to the C.M....

363
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:37,934
and bring the truth of
these scoundrels into the open.

364
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,335
Let me check.

365
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:53,566
ls anyone there?

366
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:06,339
Good evening sir.
- What's going on?

367
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,418
l got a puncture.
- All right.

368
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:13,423
What's in the back?
- lt's loaded with rice.

369
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:22,421
Get moving fast.
- All right sir.

370
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,534
You shouldn't be parking like
this in the middle of the road.

371
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:26,260
You should have
parked it on the side.

372
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:02,661
Brother...

373
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:11,807
Brother, who stabbed you?
Who were they?

374
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:17,414
m e d a l...

375
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:46,445
Don't cry. l shan't leave those
savages who stole away your husband.

376
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:50,580
No... l don't want
you to risk your life.

377
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:56,186
What was to happen has happened.
Now, you are our only support.

378
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:00,190
Better leave this police job.

379
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:02,926
What do you want me to do?

380
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:05,201
Hide behind closed doors just
because, l am afraid to die?

381
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:07,198
No way sister.

382
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:14,541
l shan't rest in peace till l
don't punish my brother's killers.

383
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:17,941
lt's been almost 20 days
since the brutal murder...

384
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:20,739
of the Mayor Chandraprakash and
the renowned journalist Arun.

385
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:22,780
By far, the question of nabbing
the real culprits is a far cry,...

386
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:24,546
you haven't even got
a clue as to who they were.

387
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:26,716
Because of this tardiness,...

388
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,825
the opposition has begun
to question our competency.

389
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:30,959
The role the media is playing
in this matter is bad for us.

390
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:33,026
And what the mass
has to say is that,...

391
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:34,926
our government has been
bribed to protect these murderers.

392
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:39,895
Don't tell me you have to
be taught some manners now.

393
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,238
ls this the time to scratch
your ears and to take a burp?

394
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:44,406
Mr. Chief Minister,...

395
00:50:44,608 --> 00:50:47,907
my principles are;
eat, enjoy and end it all.

396
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:53,247
Else, this very people will blame
us for not using our positions aptly

397
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:55,041
You are the Home Minister.

398
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:57,651
You are responsible to maintain
the law and order in this city.

399
00:50:57,954 --> 00:50:59,251
Tell me something.

400
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:01,857
Why hasn't the police yet been
able to track down the killers?

401
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:04,057
l.G., you tell me.
What is the reason behind this?

402
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:06,159
l am sorry sir.
l am helpless.

403
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:10,266
l...
l can't tolerate any further delay.

404
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:12,794
From now on,
l am taking charge of this case.

405
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:17,937
Mr. l.G., l am ordering you not
to come under any pressure and...

406
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:21,277
nail those killers
within a week's time.

407
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:28,284
Chakku Pandey is in this gym.

408
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:44,964
Welcome A.C.P...

409
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:48,297
Looks like, you have
come to measure my muscles.

410
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:50,936
Wrong! l am here
to measure your neck...

411
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:54,702
for very soon, it will
be hanging around the noose.

412
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:58,310
Dream on! Before you can
manage to get to my neck,...

413
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:02,708
your hands will be broken
by those who shelter me.

414
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,111
And, this is exactly
what l am here for;...

415
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:08,119
to find out who those people
are who are sheltering you.

416
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:42,138
Get up!

417
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:05,831
Tell me! Why did you kill
my brother and the Mayor?

418
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:10,101
Tell me...
Who hired you?

419
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:14,834
Why did you kill my brother?
Why?...

420
00:55:18,682 --> 00:55:21,173
Tell me! Who are those influential
actuators whom you are working for?

421
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:24,512
l know nothing.

422
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:33,195
He's stung me!
He's stung me like a thorn.

423
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:38,863
Damn that A.C.P. Suraj. He
screws up every damn plans l make.

424
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:43,198
An ordinary police officer
dares to stand up against me!

425
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,001
l fear Chakku Pandey
might give in...

426
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:48,539
to the third degree
Suraj has adopted on him.

427
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:55,344
No... lf he sings against us,
that will be his last song.

428
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:05,561
You and over here!
- That's right.

429
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:08,225
Why didn't you wish me in
the morning on my birthday?

430
00:56:08,598 --> 00:56:11,567
Sorry. lt completely slipped out of
my mind that today is your birthday.

431
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:19,164
Just a wish won't do.
Let me have my birthday gift.

432
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:23,373
Hey,... What are you doing?

433
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:27,172
Will you give it to me nicely
or should l take it by force?

434
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,580
What is it?
- The l.G. is here.

435
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,255
What the hell are you doing here?
The l.G. is coming here.

436
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:37,320
And, if he comes in then,...

437
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:40,390
Oh Bellamy! What do l do now?
Where are you going?

438
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:44,599
Come here.
What do l do?

439
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:46,331
Get inside!

440
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:52,204
Have a seat.
- No, thank you sir.

441
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:55,611
What news about Chakku Pandey?
Did he say anything till now?

442
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,618
Any information about
the Mayor's murderers?

443
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:15,028
l am sorry sir.
Were you asking me something?

444
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:18,892
l was asking you if
Chakku Pandey revealed anything.

445
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:21,965
l tortured him a lot and
finally, he began to say...

446
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,374
This is exactly how
he screamed in pain.

447
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:30,379
And, when l asked him who the real
murderer was, he began to say..

448
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:43,454
He began to laugh.

449
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:09,676
Looks like, you are
really not feeling too well.

450
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,681
l'd suggest, you'd
better seek medical help.

451
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:18,357
You naughty girl!
You put me down before the l.G.

452
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:22,697
l was only pulling a joke.
- Atleast listen to me...

453
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:24,593
l am leaving.

454
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:30,364
But remember to come to Hotel Taj
at 9 p.m. to celebrate my birthday.

455
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,976
Come or else,...

456
00:58:35,745 --> 00:58:37,713
l've been waiting since so long...

457
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:40,947
Madam, would you like
to place an order now?

458
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:43,381
Go and stand over there.
l am not hungry yet.

459
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:51,723
Don't know what
he thinks of himself.

460
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:54,226
lt's already 9 and
he hasn't showed up yet.

461
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:11,738
l have to go for an
important work. See you later.

462
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:14,346
What? How can you leave
when you have just arrived?

463
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:16,743
Can't help it!
- l don't know anything.

464
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:20,551
Listen darling, l have to go.

465
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:24,554
All right, but on one condition.
- Tell me fast what it is.

466
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:30,255
You will have to take this piece
of ice and reach it till my mouth.

467
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,498
What's so difficult about that.
There you go.

468
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:36,100
Without touching it.

469
01:06:56,812 --> 01:06:58,905
Say A.C.P., how are you?
- Fine.

470
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:01,944
How about a cup of tea?
- No thanks.

471
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:04,886
D.l.G. told me that you
had an urgent work with me.

472
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:08,222
l had heard a lot
about your valour.

473
01:07:09,325 --> 01:07:12,624
l have therefore put in good
words about you for your promotion.

474
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:16,957
Well, what are your
plans of becoming a D.l.G.?

475
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:21,631
Excuse me sir, but l don't
need any influence for my promotion.

476
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:24,906
Because, l have not a
slightest doubt on my capabilities.

477
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:26,832
Listen to me son.

478
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,637
The crutches of capabilities
won't take you far in this nation.

479
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:32,913
He is a very powerful man. lt would
be wise for you to listen to him.

480
01:07:33,282 --> 01:07:36,513
Excuse me, but l am not
here to listen to any advice.

481
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:39,054
Stop beating around the bush
and come to the point.

482
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:42,985
The man you have arrested...
What's his name?

483
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:47,854
That's him! That poor
fellow is such a simple man!

484
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:53,064
How could he kill anyone
if he can't even kill a fly?

485
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:55,504
Release him.

486
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:59,672
lt's not for you to decide
whether he's the culprit or not.

487
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:02,675
That's for the Judicial system
of this nation to decide.

488
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:05,876
But, the interest you are
showing in having him released...

489
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:10,718
l suspect that you have
a hand in that assassination.

490
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:14,614
That's as far as you go.

491
01:08:15,324 --> 01:08:19,693
To make the story short...
Name your price.

492
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:22,030
Now, let me give you an advice.
- Shoot!

493
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:26,299
Those who are sold out
to corruption...

494
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:29,567
can never guess
the price of honesty.

495
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:34,638
Hey boy!
Put a leash on your tongue!

496
01:08:35,077 --> 01:08:38,911
You despicable man wants to cut
the deal for my brother's murder!

497
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:42,449
Thank your luck that
l have leashed my hands.

498
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:44,117
Look at my hand!

499
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:48,982
Patriotism, honesty, dignity,
righteousness and valour;...

500
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:54,318
imagine what it would be like
if all these landed on your face.

501
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:57,657
Damn you! You are so
overwhelmed with pride...

502
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:00,131
that you even seem to
forget where you stand.

503
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:06,938
l'll be damned if l don't use my
powers to strip you off yourjob.

504
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:10,142
l swear on my sister's plight,...

505
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:15,011
l'll strip you off your post
and expose your true face...

506
01:09:15,384 --> 01:09:17,682
to the people within 24 hours.

507
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:28,363
Damn him!

508
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:07,254
Sir, l will never forget
what you did for me.

509
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:13,730
Knowing that l am your brother's
murderer, you still saved my life.

510
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:19,133
And those scoundrels,
the Home Minister and the D.l.G.

511
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:22,874
God only knows how many crimes and
murders have l committed for them.

512
01:11:23,178 --> 01:11:26,477
l risked my neck for them.
And today, these very people...

513
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:28,750
want to take my life
in order to save theirs!

514
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:32,487
No way sir.
l shan't spare them.

515
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:35,890
l shall expose each
and every crimes of theirs.

516
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:40,484
Sir, l shall now do as you say.

517
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:43,657
Yes sir!
- Record his statement.

518
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:44,899
Okay sir.

519
01:11:58,547 --> 01:12:01,516
All the ladies and gentleman
who are present here...

520
01:12:01,884 --> 01:12:06,514
to pay a tribute to the
late Mayor Chandraprakash Trivedi

521
01:12:07,022 --> 01:12:09,513
lt is sad that
our beloved Mayor...

522
01:12:09,758 --> 01:12:13,194
had to leave so soon
for the world beyond.

523
01:12:13,562 --> 01:12:18,522
Such a noble man will be
hard to find.

524
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:22,195
l can't tell you how
grief-stricken l was...

525
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:25,870
when l heard the
news of his demise.

526
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:28,537
My tears wouldn't stop.

527
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:33,548
Hey you crocodile!
Stop crying those fake tears.

528
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:35,817
Stop this sham!

529
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:50,832
Ladies and gentleman!
You are probably...

530
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:53,228
dying to know who
assassinated the Mayor.

531
01:12:54,603 --> 01:12:56,901
And you also want to know which
respectable influential figures...

532
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:59,506
of the society are involved
in this conspiracy.

533
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:05,574
This man here will disclose the
truth of the Mayor's assassination.

534
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:09,241
Chakku Pandey;
who is a contract killer.

535
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:12,587
lnstead of taking him
to the Court of law,...

536
01:13:12,755 --> 01:13:17,590
the only reason l have brought him
here to the Public court is that,...

537
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:21,591
you may yourself decide
the fate of the criminals.

538
01:13:22,698 --> 01:13:23,960
Come forward, Chakku Pandey.

539
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:30,336
l killed the Mayor.

540
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:36,837
Both D.l.G. and the Home Minister
has a hand in this assassination.

541
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:41,349
Kill them!
- Silence!

542
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:44,619
To tell such a wicked lie,...

543
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:48,946
l have been forced to come
before you by this A.C.P.

544
01:13:51,527 --> 01:13:54,621
This A.C.P. beat me up
black and blue just so that...

545
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:58,965
he may falsely accuse the
D.l.G. and the Home Minister.

546
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:01,836
But today...

547
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:04,438
Today, nothing can stop me
from speaking out the truth.

548
01:14:04,673 --> 01:14:08,336
The fact is, he is the
real murderer of the Mayor.

549
01:14:09,678 --> 01:14:12,909
He is a terrorist; a traitor!

550
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:18,981
Speak the truth else, l'll shoot you.
- Then, go ahead and shoot me.

551
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:22,382
l am ready to risk my neck
for a worthy cause...

552
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:24,818
to save the lives of the D.l.G.
and the Home Minister.

553
01:14:25,027 --> 01:14:26,289
Go ahead and shoot!

554
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:33,664
Please sit down!
Brothers...

555
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:50,115
Hey you, stop!

556
01:14:57,192 --> 01:14:59,683
What are you all staring at?
Arrest him!

557
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:11,103
Let go of me!
l say, let go of me!

558
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:32,082
Touch our leader Suraj Chauhan
again and we will gun you down.

559
01:15:33,762 --> 01:15:36,731
Long live!
Our leader Suraj Chauhan!

560
01:16:02,257 --> 01:16:04,225
Who are you and
where are you taking me?

561
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:35,783
You are a uniformed traitor and
the leader of the terrorists.

562
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:37,318
No...

563
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:56,004
How are you, A.C.P.?

564
01:16:58,347 --> 01:17:03,478
You wanted to strip me
within 24 hours, didn't you?

565
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:08,551
But instead, l stripped you
off your uniform...

566
01:17:08,924 --> 01:17:12,416
and branded you as a
terrorist within 12 hours.

567
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:16,092
You are too proud of
your position, aren't you?

568
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:18,433
You shall now rot in jail.

569
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:20,567
No matter how hard you may try,...

570
01:17:20,869 --> 01:17:24,361
you will never get
back into those uniform.

571
01:17:27,943 --> 01:17:30,173
Let go of me!

572
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:38,452
Beat him up!

573
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:45,593
Beat him up so much that he may never
be able to walk on his feet again.

574
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:49,659
Beat him up more!

575
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:56,663
Based on all the substantiated
facts and evidence,...

576
01:17:57,305 --> 01:17:59,535
the court has reached a verdict.

577
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:02,670
The police officer
Suraj Chauhan is in fact...

578
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:05,113
a dangerous terrorist
under his official uniform.

579
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:08,680
His hands are smeared with
the blood of the innocents.

580
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:12,616
Fearing his true identity will
be disclosed before the people,...

581
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:15,151
he publicly shot
down Chakku Pandey.

582
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:18,552
Therefore, this Court sentences
the accused Suraj Chauhan...

583
01:18:18,994 --> 01:18:21,485
to a life
sentence in the penitentiary.

584
01:18:30,939 --> 01:18:35,638
What's this? Making my life
a hell, she is having her siesta!

585
01:18:36,745 --> 01:18:39,908
Now, witness the wonders
of this poison ivy.

586
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:45,251
l bet, she will go
crazy scratching herself.

587
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:05,731
What happened?

588
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:17,112
What's going on?

589
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:23,287
Lower your hands!

590
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:26,556
Move your hands away
from your body!

591
01:19:34,069 --> 01:19:37,630
l suspend you for your indecent
behaviour in the police station.

592
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:38,126
Oh no!
All my hard work went to waste!

593
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:40,492
Hey you! Why didn't you tell me
your water pot had a hole in it?

594
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:42,670
Who the heck are you?

595
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:57,342
How strange!
We look so much alike each other.

596
01:25:57,886 --> 01:26:01,344
How true! l feel as if l am
looking at myself in the mirror.

597
01:26:01,856 --> 01:26:03,824
But, how is that possible?

598
01:26:04,559 --> 01:26:07,084
Probably, we must have been blood
brother in our previous life.

599
01:26:07,462 --> 01:26:11,990
You got that right!
Looking at you, l too felt the same.

600
01:26:12,433 --> 01:26:16,961
What's your name?
- l am Rajnikant's fan, get it!

601
01:26:17,405 --> 01:26:20,033
What th...
- l didn't curse you.

602
01:26:20,408 --> 01:26:23,377
ln Tamil, that means,
''Did you get it?''

603
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:26,977
How come you are in here?
- What do l say now?

604
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:30,177
On my wedding night,
a lecherous scoundrel...

605
01:26:30,418 --> 01:26:32,784
laid his dirty hands on my
bride; l cut his hands off.

606
01:26:33,421 --> 01:26:39,053
l got arrested and here l am!
l am not sad about being jailed.

607
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:43,097
What's distressing is, l couldn't
spend the night with my wife.

608
01:26:44,766 --> 01:26:47,394
Forget about me.
You say, what brings you here?

609
01:26:47,769 --> 01:26:50,397
l didn't come here,
but was brought here.

610
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:54,403
Afraid of their death, some
people shut me up behind bars.

611
01:26:55,443 --> 01:26:57,741
Those miscreants killed my brother.

612
01:27:12,393 --> 01:27:15,157
Leaders of now-a-days
are so knavish that,...

613
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:18,431
they will never falter
to stab in the back of the people.

614
01:27:18,866 --> 01:27:22,427
And we are so stupid to vote them.
- l shan't spare them!

615
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:24,228
l'll be released in a week.

616
01:27:24,472 --> 01:27:27,771
And then you just wait and watch
how l make their lives miserable.

617
01:27:30,511 --> 01:27:33,446
But, l don't know anyone.

618
01:27:33,781 --> 01:27:35,840
How will l ever
make their lives miserable?

619
01:27:37,485 --> 01:27:42,718
ldea!! How about we both
switch over our identities?

620
01:27:42,957 --> 01:27:44,720
What do you mean?
- What l mean is...

621
01:27:44,892 --> 01:27:48,123
you go out instead of me...

622
01:27:48,496 --> 01:27:52,796
and as Rajnikant, have your
vengeance and nail those villains.

623
01:27:54,502 --> 01:27:58,063
No way Rajnikant. Your offer
sounds good, but l can't take it.

624
01:27:58,573 --> 01:28:01,474
What you are saying
can never happen.

625
01:28:01,876 --> 01:28:04,140
And why not?
What do you want?

626
01:28:04,512 --> 01:28:06,480
Do you want to rot all
your life behind bars...

627
01:28:06,648 --> 01:28:09,014
and let those
culprits enjoy their life!

628
01:28:09,317 --> 01:28:12,753
Do you want to cry over your defeat
and let them celebrate their victory?

629
01:28:13,821 --> 01:28:17,086
Do you or don't you want to
avenge the death of your brother?

630
01:28:17,859 --> 01:28:21,488
Do you or don't you want to expose
those culprits before the world?

631
01:28:22,864 --> 01:28:26,493
Listen... You called me your brother
from your past life, didn't you?

632
01:28:26,934 --> 01:28:29,095
That makes my mother
to be your mother, doesn't it?

633
01:28:29,537 --> 01:28:33,496
Then, swear on to you of my mother.
Take my advice and do as l say.

634
01:28:40,682 --> 01:28:43,242
Phoolan!
- Coming...

635
01:28:44,018 --> 01:28:45,986
Where the hell are you?
Come out!

636
01:28:47,555 --> 01:28:49,523
What were you doing inside?
- l was washing your dirty laundry.

637
01:28:49,724 --> 01:28:51,692
Hurry up!
Don't you want to cook?

638
01:28:51,893 --> 01:28:54,123
l do.
Where's the baton?

639
01:28:54,562 --> 01:28:57,690
Whatever do l need it for?
l have been suspended.

640
01:28:58,566 --> 01:29:00,329
Okay...
Get me a cup of tea.

641
01:29:00,568 --> 01:29:02,035
Right away.
Hurry up!

642
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:05,801
ls Phoolan in?
- What do you want?

643
01:29:06,074 --> 01:29:07,803
l have something
important to discuss with her.

644
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:09,442
ls this the time
to talk to her?

645
01:29:09,577 --> 01:29:11,943
You have come to disturb a husband
and a wife. Get out!

646
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:14,548
When did this timid lion
learn to roar?

647
01:29:15,650 --> 01:29:19,552
Here is your tea.
- Tea! ls this a tea time?

648
01:29:20,388 --> 01:29:23,221
Now go and fetch me
a bottle of wine from the market.

649
01:29:23,591 --> 01:29:26,719
How would you feel if l, your wife
went to buy you a bottle of wine?

650
01:29:27,095 --> 01:29:31,293
How did you feel when l, your
husband did all the household chores

651
01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:34,224
Don't you dare act smart with me.
Now go and fetch me a bottle of wine!

652
01:29:34,602 --> 01:29:36,365
Let me change and then l'll go.

653
01:29:36,604 --> 01:29:39,573
Change right here
and not on your way out.

654
01:29:39,907 --> 01:29:41,568
Okay!
- Now go!!

655
01:29:44,679 --> 01:29:48,376
Hey stop! You can't fool
me and quietly slip away.

656
01:29:51,619 --> 01:29:53,985
What do you mean?
- Where's my fag?

657
01:29:54,622 --> 01:29:56,749
l don't smoke.
- Oh really!

658
01:29:57,058 --> 01:30:00,255
Nice try and it's all because
you are be released today.

659
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:03,390
All right! l shan't spare you
the next time you are in.

660
01:30:03,698 --> 01:30:05,598
Go ahead now.

661
01:30:28,656 --> 01:30:29,623
My son!

662
01:30:31,459 --> 01:30:33,791
Looks like,
they are Rajni's family.

663
01:30:35,763 --> 01:30:37,924
Mother...

664
01:30:40,935 --> 01:30:42,903
Pandu, how are you?

665
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:45,966
Pandu! Quite a close call.

666
01:30:46,774 --> 01:30:48,207
Son-in-law...

667
01:30:53,147 --> 01:30:55,638
My son...
- Mother...

668
01:30:56,684 --> 01:30:58,652
Father...
- God bless you son.

669
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:00,783
Mother...
- My dear...

670
01:31:01,022 --> 01:31:03,820
Life was not the same without you.

671
01:31:04,692 --> 01:31:07,661
And look at the daughter-in-law.
Look how thin she's grown.

672
01:31:08,095 --> 01:31:11,326
How are you?
- How are you, my lady?

673
01:31:11,699 --> 01:31:14,668
My lady! Did you hear
what he just addressed me as?

674
01:31:14,969 --> 01:31:16,869
All my life l tried my
best to straighten him up.

675
01:31:17,071 --> 01:31:19,665
But a few days in
the jail did the trick.

676
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:22,009
l am sorry.
How are you?

677
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:26,007
Sorry! Come home and
l'll tell you how l am.

678
01:31:36,791 --> 01:31:39,123
That is enough son.
lt's too late now.

679
01:31:39,527 --> 01:31:42,496
Daughter-in-law is expecting you.
You go now.

680
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:45,294
lt's been so long now since
l actually cared for my mother.

681
01:31:45,733 --> 01:31:48,099
Tonight, l will serve
you the entire night.

682
01:31:54,742 --> 01:31:56,710
Well, your wife is calling you.

683
01:31:56,944 --> 01:32:00,710
What's the hurry, mom? l'll go
after you have gone to sleep.

684
01:32:01,048 --> 01:32:05,382
Don't you worry about my sleep.
Old people rarely sleep.

685
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:08,050
You go now.
- Mom...

686
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,394
What's wrong with you?
Why are you putting up this act?

687
01:32:15,763 --> 01:32:18,391
Why didn't you come? Didn't you
hear me calling you since so long?

688
01:32:18,833 --> 01:32:21,063
This night has come
after such a long wait...

689
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:24,338
and you were tending to your mother!
Silly boy!

690
01:32:24,772 --> 01:32:27,468
What are you staring at?
Get to bed.

691
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:32,077
Listen to me. l am exhausted.
Let me sleep.

692
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:36,339
What? - Actually, l used to
sleep by 7:30 in the jail.

693
01:32:36,784 --> 01:32:40,345
l can't keep awake any longer.
- To hell with your habit.

694
01:32:40,788 --> 01:32:43,757
Better get it straight. l shan't
let you sleep the whole night.

695
01:32:44,191 --> 01:32:46,421
Listen to me...
Let me sleep.

696
01:32:49,196 --> 01:32:52,359
Why are you doing this to me?
What would you know...

697
01:32:52,867 --> 01:32:55,563
how many sleepless nights
have l passed in wait for you.

698
01:32:57,805 --> 01:33:00,103
l had such great
plans for our marriage.

699
01:38:38,746 --> 01:38:40,907
Listen to me...
l am not your Rajnikant.

700
01:38:46,353 --> 01:38:48,787
Oh my!
He is a very good man.

701
01:38:49,156 --> 01:38:52,523
l'd be crying now if it had been
someone else in his place, right!

702
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:56,459
He sure has to be my
brother from my past life.

703
01:38:57,164 --> 01:38:59,792
You help him in every
possible way you can.

704
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:03,797
ls that so!
My happiness lies in yours.

705
01:39:05,239 --> 01:39:07,799
How much you care
for my happiness.

706
01:39:08,242 --> 01:39:10,540
And till now, l haven't
been able to make you happy.

707
01:39:11,178 --> 01:39:13,476
lt's been so long since our
marriage and till today,...

708
01:39:13,681 --> 01:39:15,649
l haven't been
able to gratify you.

709
01:39:15,916 --> 01:39:19,716
Don't say such things.
lt makes me very uneasy.

710
01:39:20,187 --> 01:39:23,156
Oh yeah!
My condition is too serious.

711
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:29,161
Come hither. How about
l bribe the guards and...

712
01:39:29,563 --> 01:39:31,758
may make some arrangements for our
honeymoon right here in the jail?

713
01:39:31,999 --> 01:39:34,763
Aren't you ashamed to say such things?
- How much longer you want me to wait?

714
01:39:35,202 --> 01:39:37,534
By far, you've shown such patience.
lt's just a matter of days now.

715
01:39:37,871 --> 01:39:40,704
Darling, these bars are so thick...

716
01:39:41,208 --> 01:39:43,176
l can't even put out
my head and kiss you.

717
01:39:43,377 --> 01:39:44,571
Be quiet!
Someone might hear you.

718
01:39:45,212 --> 01:39:47,908
Darling, let me bribe
the guard, please!

719
01:39:48,315 --> 01:39:50,510
He will take care of everything.

720
01:39:52,353 --> 01:39:55,550
Hey! Aren't you ashamed of yourself
to hold the hands of another girl?

721
01:39:55,923 --> 01:39:57,891
Whom are you calling another girl?

722
01:39:58,225 --> 01:40:01,661
He is my husband.
He can do anything with me.

723
01:40:01,962 --> 01:40:03,987
Who the heck are
you to question him?

724
01:40:04,932 --> 01:40:07,901
You are after my boyfriend just
because he is so good-looking.

725
01:40:08,335 --> 01:40:10,860
Your boyfriend! Say that again
& l'll have your tongue.

726
01:40:11,138 --> 01:40:13,197
Oh yeah! Say that again and
l'll break all your teeth.

727
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:16,739
l'll wring your neck
if you do that.

728
01:40:16,977 --> 01:40:19,878
l too will wring your neck...
- l'll kill you...

729
01:40:20,247 --> 01:40:23,944
lf l am not mistaken, she's got
to be Suraj's girl. Stop...

730
01:40:25,052 --> 01:40:27,782
l'll kill you!
- Rani, will you stop that?

731
01:40:28,055 --> 01:40:29,022
Sister...

732
01:40:29,256 --> 01:40:31,224
What's that?
Did you call me your sister?

733
01:40:31,692 --> 01:40:33,660
l am telling you
the truth, get it!

734
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:37,228
l am Suraj's look alike;
his duplicate.

735
01:40:37,498 --> 01:40:41,229
Then, where is Suraj?
- lt's a very long story.

736
01:40:41,568 --> 01:40:44,230
He's out to get the bad guys.

737
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:48,508
Who is it?

738
01:40:50,844 --> 01:40:53,039
Why do l have to be disturbed
just when l am enjoying my drink?

739
01:41:14,301 --> 01:41:16,599
Now you have had it!

740
01:41:20,207 --> 01:41:22,266
Jai Maharashtra!
This is a bomb.

741
01:41:22,643 --> 01:41:27,842
We will fix it up here and
it will blow up after 3 minutes.

742
01:41:28,315 --> 01:41:30,943
Oh no!
- Then tell me...

743
01:41:31,552 --> 01:41:33,520
Why did you testify falsely
in the court that...

744
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:35,847
Pandey hadn't given any testimonies
against the Home Minister?

745
01:41:36,056 --> 01:41:39,287
All because, the Home Minister
promised to make me the A.C.P.

746
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,888
You all make such despicable
deals for the sake of a chair.

747
01:41:43,397 --> 01:41:46,025
And, it all because of men like
you that the image of the police...

748
01:41:46,333 --> 01:41:48,301
has lost it's worth
in the public eye.

749
01:41:58,345 --> 01:42:00,313
Take this and fix it fast.

750
01:42:03,817 --> 01:42:05,682
Here you go!
Put it back on.

751
01:42:15,362 --> 01:42:17,330
Wow, what do you know...
- How do l look?

752
01:42:17,798 --> 01:42:20,323
Just like an angel.

753
01:42:23,704 --> 01:42:25,831
l did not like
one habit of yours.

754
01:42:26,173 --> 01:42:29,142
What's that?
- You breaking the promise.

755
01:42:29,643 --> 01:42:31,611
You promised to speak
to the Home Minister...

756
01:42:31,812 --> 01:42:35,145
and make me the Mayor
in place of the late Mayor.

757
01:42:35,482 --> 01:42:40,351
Forgot so soon?
- How can l? You are my life.

758
01:42:40,854 --> 01:42:46,349
After the Mayor, it is only
you whom l love so dearly.

759
01:42:59,573 --> 01:43:01,438
Hello sir, it's me Prabhakar speaking.
- What is it?

760
01:43:01,642 --> 01:43:04,372
Suraj was here just a while ago.
- What rubbish!

761
01:43:04,811 --> 01:43:07,041
How can he pay a visit to you?
He is in the jail.

762
01:43:07,514 --> 01:43:09,607
Sir, l swear to you, he was
at my place just a while ago.

763
01:43:09,917 --> 01:43:12,181
He threatened to kill me and
somehow managed to squeeze out...

764
01:43:12,419 --> 01:43:14,387
the truth about
Pandey's testimony from me.

765
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:19,057
What?
l hope he hasn't broken the jail.

766
01:43:29,770 --> 01:43:32,068
What a surprise, Mr. Minister.
- Where the hell is that Suraj?

767
01:43:32,506 --> 01:43:35,407
He is right here...
- l heard that he broke out ofjail.

768
01:43:35,776 --> 01:43:38,404
This is impossible sir.
- l'd still like to see him myself.

769
01:43:40,447 --> 01:43:43,007
The Home Minister and the
D.l.G. are here to meet you.

770
01:43:44,551 --> 01:43:46,018
Good day sir.

771
01:43:48,589 --> 01:43:51,217
These are the very miscreants who
played their dirty games against...

772
01:43:51,458 --> 01:43:54,427
Suraj and had him incarcerated.
l really feel like...

773
01:43:58,799 --> 01:44:01,768
What's this?
He is right here.

774
01:44:02,469 --> 01:44:04,630
You gave me a wrong information.
- Yes but...

775
01:44:07,474 --> 01:44:12,434
Well, former A.C.P.,
how did you find my move?

776
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:15,380
l bet it changed
your life completely.

777
01:44:15,816 --> 01:44:19,445
l bet you can never guess
whose life has changed.

778
01:44:22,556 --> 01:44:26,458
An honest, loyal police
officer of yesteryear...

779
01:44:26,994 --> 01:44:30,122
is now standing before me
as a treacherous criminal.

780
01:44:30,497 --> 01:44:34,058
lf a Miscreant like you
can become a Minister;...

781
01:44:34,501 --> 01:44:36,469
imagine what can
become of people like us.

782
01:44:37,504 --> 01:44:39,267
How dare you speak in a
sarcastic tone with the Minister?

783
01:44:39,406 --> 01:44:41,271
Let him speak.

784
01:44:41,908 --> 01:44:44,638
He is all cooked up inside.
Let him let out the heat.

785
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:49,876
Do you know what you look
like holding this plate?

786
01:44:50,617 --> 01:44:53,142
You look like a beggar
begging for food.

787
01:44:53,587 --> 01:45:00,823
A penny for me...
ls all l plea...

788
01:45:01,528 --> 01:45:03,496
And, do you know
what you look like?

789
01:45:03,964 --> 01:45:07,695
You look like a street dog trying
to jump onto the beggar's food.

790
01:45:13,106 --> 01:45:16,075
Damn you!

791
01:45:16,576 --> 01:45:19,511
Damn you too!

792
01:45:25,552 --> 01:45:27,520
l shan't spare you now.

793
01:45:30,023 --> 01:45:34,323
Beat him up till he runs dry.
- To hell with him.

794
01:45:35,796 --> 01:45:38,526
What was the need for you to
visit the jail and beat up Suraj?

795
01:45:38,965 --> 01:45:41,263
Do you even realize this feat of
yours has created such a tension?

796
01:45:41,635 --> 01:45:45,071
All the prisoners have gone on
a hunger strike. - Very good!

797
01:45:45,572 --> 01:45:47,540
This month, you will get minimal
ration bill from the jail.

798
01:45:47,908 --> 01:45:51,139
Don't talk nonsense!
And tell me the truth.

799
01:45:51,378 --> 01:45:53,346
What was the real reason of
your visit and beating up Suraj?

800
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:58,540
Mr. C.M., l got the news
that, Suraj was planning...

801
01:45:59,019 --> 01:46:01,544
your assassination from
behind the walls of the jail.

802
01:46:01,988 --> 01:46:04,548
l therefore went with the D.l.G.
to personally investigate the matter.

803
01:46:05,025 --> 01:46:07,220
lt is my prime duty to
protect your life, ain't it?

804
01:46:07,594 --> 01:46:11,360
To you, Suraj is
a terrorist; a traitor.

805
01:46:11,932 --> 01:46:15,561
But to me, he is an honest
and a loyal police officer.

806
01:46:16,103 --> 01:46:18,230
l have a feeling
that he is innocent.

807
01:46:18,605 --> 01:46:20,573
l've a great respect for
the law & therefore...

808
01:46:20,741 --> 01:46:22,709
l'm not interfering in this matter.

809
01:46:23,143 --> 01:46:25,373
And, as far as
my death is concerned,...

810
01:46:25,612 --> 01:46:27,375
that's the least of my worries.

811
01:46:27,647 --> 01:46:30,912
So, stop worrying about me and
go and apologize to the prisoners.

812
01:46:31,351 --> 01:46:33,945
Else, l will dismiss
you from the Cabinet.

813
01:46:34,488 --> 01:46:39,585
Damn that Chief Minister!

814
01:46:39,993 --> 01:46:41,961
How dare he threaten me!

815
01:46:42,629 --> 01:46:45,257
He is threatening to
throw me out of the Cabinet.

816
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:47,725
How dare he!

817
01:46:48,135 --> 01:46:51,104
How can he dismiss
you just like that?

818
01:46:51,638 --> 01:46:56,007
lt's not his rule.
He is not aware of what you are.

819
01:46:56,743 --> 01:47:01,146
You are a killing machine
and a very fiend fellow.

820
01:47:01,715 --> 01:47:04,275
You are a very mean man.

821
01:47:04,918 --> 01:47:07,614
He who tires to get at you
will be signing a death will.

822
01:47:07,988 --> 01:47:12,618
lt is you who know
how dangerous l am.

823
01:47:13,293 --> 01:47:17,195
But, it is l who will tell
him what a dangerous man l am.

824
01:47:18,665 --> 01:47:21,293
Before he throws me
out from the Cabinet,...

825
01:47:21,868 --> 01:47:23,631
l'd better throw
him out of this world.

826
01:47:23,904 --> 01:47:26,304
Hope you have a plan.
- l have.

827
01:47:26,873 --> 01:47:28,636
On the 1st of August,
the Presidency College...

828
01:47:28,809 --> 01:47:30,640
is hosting its
diamond jubilee function.

829
01:47:31,478 --> 01:47:34,641
And the Chief guest will be
none other than our dear C.M.

830
01:47:35,182 --> 01:47:38,982
As soon as we get a clear shot,
the C.M. will be gunned down.

831
01:47:41,488 --> 01:47:43,456
Hey, who is it?
What do you want?

832
01:47:55,135 --> 01:47:56,432
Who is it?

833
01:48:01,174 --> 01:48:03,665
Hey, that's Suraj.
- That's right.

834
01:48:03,910 --> 01:48:07,004
What are you standing here for?
Go and catch him!

835
01:48:56,763 --> 01:48:58,253
What's going on?

836
01:49:01,301 --> 01:49:02,359
My son...

837
01:49:03,770 --> 01:49:05,738
What is he doing?
- No...

838
01:49:13,313 --> 01:49:14,280
Catch him!

839
01:49:18,785 --> 01:49:22,152
Mom!
Mom, what did you do this for?

840
01:49:28,161 --> 01:49:33,030
Mom...
- You are crying!

841
01:49:34,801 --> 01:49:41,570
What could be more
glorifying for any mother...

842
01:49:42,809 --> 01:49:50,773
than to die in the arms of the
very child she gave birth to.

843
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:57,519
No mom, don't say that.
l shan't let that happen to you.

844
01:49:58,825 --> 01:50:01,055
Mom...
- Let me do something...

845
01:50:14,174 --> 01:50:17,405
Good-for-nothing! How could
you let your prey get away?

846
01:50:17,844 --> 01:50:19,812
Just when l was about
to take care of Suraj...

847
01:50:19,980 --> 01:50:21,948
an old woman jumped in and got killed.
A big crowd gathered around...

848
01:50:22,182 --> 01:50:23,809
and l had to flee.
- Damn you!

849
01:50:24,651 --> 01:50:26,619
l just spoke
to the jail superintendent.

850
01:50:26,853 --> 01:50:30,152
Suraj is in the jail.
- What is this mystery?

851
01:50:30,857 --> 01:50:33,417
He is in the jail
and he's outside too!

852
01:50:34,194 --> 01:50:36,822
However does he do that?

853
01:50:54,881 --> 01:50:57,850
How can the funeral rites
be performed without him?

854
01:50:59,953 --> 01:51:02,444
lt will...
lt definitely will...

855
01:51:03,890 --> 01:51:05,653
He will only do it.

856
01:51:13,233 --> 01:51:14,860
Unload them.

857
01:51:16,136 --> 01:51:18,468
You go ahead... Next!

858
01:51:22,642 --> 01:51:28,205
Eat and enjoy and
have a good sleep.

859
01:51:34,788 --> 01:51:35,880
Oh my!

860
01:51:37,991 --> 01:51:40,221
How come you are here so soon?

861
01:51:40,994 --> 01:51:44,691
Better get home right now.
- And why is that?

862
01:51:46,733 --> 01:51:51,693
Now, how do l tell you?
Your mother is no more.

863
01:52:00,113 --> 01:52:03,082
What are you saying?

864
01:52:03,950 --> 01:52:08,250
My mother loves me a lot.
She can never leave me.

865
01:52:08,755 --> 01:52:10,916
This is true; believe it!

866
01:52:11,291 --> 01:52:14,590
Oh no!
How did this happen?

867
01:52:14,961 --> 01:52:18,727
How did my mother die?
- There is no time to talk about that.

868
01:52:18,965 --> 01:52:20,933
The goods truck is about to leave.
You'd better hurry up.

869
01:52:21,101 --> 01:52:23,592
Go and take care of the obsequies.
- l'll go.

870
01:53:01,808 --> 01:53:03,776
What are you doing?

871
01:53:04,344 --> 01:53:06,471
Won't you be going
back to the jail?

872
01:53:06,813 --> 01:53:08,781
No...
- What are you saying?

873
01:53:09,349 --> 01:53:11,647
lf you don't back, how will
the objective be ever accomplished...

874
01:53:11,818 --> 01:53:14,981
to achieve which you were
helping brother Suraj?

875
01:53:16,689 --> 01:53:19,658
ls it right to leave
him stranded halfway?

876
01:53:20,393 --> 01:53:23,726
Right now, nothing is more
important to me than...

877
01:53:24,030 --> 01:53:26,328
to avenge my
mother's death.

878
01:53:27,033 --> 01:53:31,697
l shan't go back
until l don't chop off...

879
01:53:32,038 --> 01:53:35,337
that murderer's head
with this hatchet.

880
01:53:36,042 --> 01:53:38,738
You have seen that killer's face,
haven't you? Come with me.

881
01:53:59,866 --> 01:54:01,834
On the 1st of August is
the diamond jubilee function...

882
01:54:02,068 --> 01:54:03,831
of the Presidency college.

883
01:54:04,270 --> 01:54:07,637
And the chief guest of that
function is the Chief Minister.

884
01:54:08,341 --> 01:54:11,833
As soon as we get a clear shot,
he will be gunned down.

885
01:54:15,949 --> 01:54:17,746
Let me tell you how.

886
01:54:18,017 --> 01:54:21,043
Say that Suraj's life
is in danger in the jail.

887
01:54:21,521 --> 01:54:24,649
Order for his transfer to
the Nasik jail tomorrow itself.

888
01:54:25,091 --> 01:54:27,651
And, you have also planned out
the assassination of the C.M.

889
01:54:27,894 --> 01:54:29,862
in the college's function tomorrow.

890
01:54:30,430 --> 01:54:32,557
After the assassination
of the Chief Minister,...

891
01:54:32,765 --> 01:54:34,665
get rid of Suraj too
on his way to the jail.

892
01:54:34,901 --> 01:54:38,860
Spread this rumour that, Suraj
broke the police custody and...

893
01:54:39,105 --> 01:54:43,565
assassinated the C.M. and then
got killed in the police encounter.

894
01:54:50,116 --> 01:54:51,674
Where are you taking me?

895
01:55:52,178 --> 01:55:55,944
Good morning.
This way sir.

896
01:56:02,255 --> 01:56:04,155
Hello...
- Hello!

897
01:56:07,293 --> 01:56:08,885
Sir, shall we begin the function?

898
01:56:14,968 --> 01:56:17,528
Respected Chief Minister,
Home Minister,...

899
01:56:17,870 --> 01:56:20,964
guests and beloved
students of this college.

900
01:56:21,441 --> 01:56:24,842
On behalf of the college,
l cordially welcome you all...

901
01:56:25,211 --> 01:56:28,510
to the diamond jubilee
function of this college.

902
01:56:32,018 --> 01:56:35,181
l now invite the
Chief Minister on the stage.

903
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:58,700
Greetings to all present; respected
teachers and dear students.

904
01:56:59,946 --> 01:57:02,642
Nothing could be more
glorifying to me that,...

905
01:57:03,249 --> 01:57:05,809
the institution through which
l acquired my knowledge;...

906
01:57:06,252 --> 01:57:08,550
l am presiding over
as a chief guest...

907
01:57:08,821 --> 01:57:11,289
to celebrate its
diamond jubilee celebration.

908
01:57:11,991 --> 01:57:15,825
l'd first like
to honour all my teachers...

909
01:57:16,529 --> 01:57:19,020
whose teachings and
blessings helped me...

910
01:57:19,265 --> 01:57:21,165
to reach the position
where l stand now.

911
01:57:43,289 --> 01:57:45,257
lt's a pity that terrorism
and vandalism is thriving...

912
01:57:45,425 --> 01:57:47,393
in every nooks and
corners of this nation.

913
01:57:50,630 --> 01:57:54,259
Only a handful of honest cops and
loyal ministers can't fight war.

914
01:57:57,770 --> 01:58:05,267
We therefore need the common man
to come out to wage a war against...

915
01:58:06,312 --> 01:58:10,749
these troublemakers and if need be,
lay their lives for a noble cause.

916
01:58:11,184 --> 01:58:13,948
We will have to set up
a student's army who will...

917
01:58:14,454 --> 01:58:17,082
carry the torch of revolution
in every corner of the nation...

918
01:58:17,323 --> 01:58:19,450
and find and exterminate the rats
that are gnawing at our roots.

919
01:58:19,659 --> 01:58:24,460
Separate the wheat from the chaff &
realize who the enemy of the state is

920
01:58:43,082 --> 01:58:44,310
Jai Hind!

921
02:00:08,701 --> 02:00:10,396
Mayor's wife!

922
02:00:11,871 --> 02:00:16,205
Where do you think you are going?
l shan't spare you...

923
02:00:21,881 --> 02:00:23,405
Don't spare him!

924
02:00:52,478 --> 02:00:53,638
No...

925
02:01:00,820 --> 02:01:02,117
No...

926
02:01:16,602 --> 02:01:18,467
Forgive me brother.

927
02:01:18,938 --> 02:01:21,270
lt was because of him
l didn't come back to the jail.

928
02:01:22,508 --> 02:01:25,204
But, why did you come out?

929
02:01:26,512 --> 02:01:28,480
lf l hadn't come out, Chakku
Pandey would have succeeded...

930
02:01:28,614 --> 02:01:31,481
in his attempt to assassinate the C.M.
- Chakku Pandey!

931
02:01:32,218 --> 02:01:34,186
But, didn't you tell me back
in the jail that he's dead?

932
02:01:34,387 --> 02:01:37,288
He is very much alive. This was
the Home Minister's conspiracy.

933
02:01:37,790 --> 02:01:40,224
l'd have surely
had him today if only...

934
02:01:40,526 --> 02:01:42,494
the Mayor's wife hadn't
helped him escape.

935
02:01:42,928 --> 02:01:45,488
No matter how far he may run,
but he can never hide from me.

936
02:01:45,931 --> 02:01:50,300
l'll hunt him down
and l'll fix him.

937
02:01:50,703 --> 02:01:54,833
No... We will have to plan
out a strategy for that.

938
02:01:55,241 --> 02:02:00,679
Damn you! You jeopardized
my fool-proof plan.

939
02:02:01,213 --> 02:02:03,181
Did you shoot the C.M.?
No...

940
02:02:03,449 --> 02:02:05,679
And instead, you showed
your ugly face to Suraj.

941
02:02:06,018 --> 02:02:07,883
You screwed up everything.

942
02:02:09,121 --> 02:02:11,089
Only Suraj has
seen Chakku Pandey.

943
02:02:11,557 --> 02:02:13,787
And Suraj has been
charged for his murder.

944
02:02:14,160 --> 02:02:16,253
Until and unless Suraj
doesn't catch him alive,...

945
02:02:16,562 --> 02:02:19,190
nobody will believe a word he says.
- All that is understood.

946
02:02:19,632 --> 02:02:22,601
But, Suraj won't keep still.

947
02:02:22,968 --> 02:02:26,199
He will hunt him down
like a wild dog and nail him.

948
02:02:26,639 --> 02:02:28,869
l'll finish him off
before any of this happens.

949
02:02:29,175 --> 02:02:33,202
You will kill him!
You will do nothing of the sort.

950
02:02:33,646 --> 02:02:38,140
You will stay right here.
Nobody will hear you nor see you.

951
02:02:38,617 --> 02:02:42,917
And if anybody happens to
see you, you are a dead meat.

952
02:02:44,123 --> 02:02:46,216
lt is your duty
to take care of him.

953
02:02:46,592 --> 02:02:48,560
Don't you worry about anything.
l'll take good care of him.

954
02:02:49,995 --> 02:02:51,553
Let's go.

955
02:02:59,638 --> 02:03:01,572
Hello sir.
Whom do you want to meet?

956
02:03:01,774 --> 02:03:04,572
God bless you.
ls the Mayor's wife in?

957
02:03:04,944 --> 02:03:07,105
Yes, she is.
- Bring in the luggage.

958
02:03:09,715 --> 02:03:13,276
Sister-in-law...
Where thou dost are ye?

959
02:03:14,420 --> 02:03:18,584
Sister, how did this happen?

960
02:03:19,792 --> 02:03:23,592
Who killed your husband
and my brother?

961
02:03:23,996 --> 02:03:29,400
Who are you?
- My name is Pannalal, etc.. etc..

962
02:03:29,902 --> 02:03:32,200
l am your hubby's childhood friend.

963
02:03:32,571 --> 02:03:35,597
But, l've never seen you before.
- How could you?

964
02:03:36,075 --> 02:03:39,272
You were not even married when l
left for Africa on a business trip.

965
02:03:39,712 --> 02:03:42,203
But, my brother did happen to
send me one of your photograph.

966
02:03:42,915 --> 02:03:46,214
But, what did l know that when
l'd return back to my motherland...

967
02:03:46,786 --> 02:03:49,619
my brother would have
already kicked the bucket.

968
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:53,955
My brother...
My dear brother...

969
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:56,625
Why did you leave me alone?

970
02:03:56,996 --> 02:03:59,123
The least you could
do before you died...

971
02:03:59,331 --> 02:04:01,959
was to make an
international call to me.

972
02:04:11,010 --> 02:04:15,379
Don't cry, my dear Lily.

973
02:04:16,682 --> 02:04:18,650
Sir, is this girl
your daughter?

974
02:04:19,685 --> 02:04:22,051
Did you hear what he just said?

975
02:04:22,421 --> 02:04:24,389
That's the very reason why
l don't go anywhere with you.

976
02:04:24,690 --> 02:04:27,250
God damn you.
Have you gone blind?

977
02:04:27,693 --> 02:04:29,661
How dare you refer
to my wife as my daughter?

978
02:04:29,962 --> 02:04:31,930
What?
ls she your wife?

979
02:04:32,264 --> 02:04:34,232
She is the fourth...
She is my fourth wife.

980
02:04:34,700 --> 02:04:38,466
But sister, is he your brother?
- He is related to me.

981
02:04:39,138 --> 02:04:42,073
God damn you.
You look more like a crook to me.

982
02:04:42,374 --> 02:04:44,399
What nonsense are you talking?
- Nothing nonsense about it.

983
02:04:44,710 --> 02:04:48,339
lt's written all your face. You are
either a crook or a corrupt cop.

984
02:04:48,714 --> 02:04:51,274
He is the D.l.G.
- l am D.l.G. Vijaykumar.

985
02:04:51,717 --> 02:04:53,685
But, how did you
make a correct guess?

986
02:04:53,886 --> 02:04:56,855
Actually, l happen
to have some psychic powers.

987
02:04:57,723 --> 02:05:01,352
Sis, l wish to have
a word with you in private.

988
02:05:02,728 --> 02:05:04,025
Let's go then.

989
02:05:04,196 --> 02:05:06,494
You go ahead;
l'll follow you with the bag.

990
02:05:16,141 --> 02:05:17,631
Please come this way.

991
02:05:18,010 --> 02:05:20,444
Take this wealth.
lt's all yours.

992
02:05:21,881 --> 02:05:25,510
So much money!
- lt's not much. Just 5 million.

993
02:05:25,918 --> 02:05:27,510
Why are you giving it to me?

994
02:05:27,820 --> 02:05:31,722
The fact is, when l was leaving
for Africa on a business trip...

995
02:05:32,057 --> 02:05:34,525
l had taken a loan of
1 million from your husband.

996
02:05:34,927 --> 02:05:39,227
The principal amount and interest
makes it a 10 million rupees.

997
02:05:39,932 --> 02:05:44,301
l am giving you half now & will pay
you half in a couple of days.

998
02:05:44,770 --> 02:05:48,331
Hope you trust me.
- What are you saying?

999
02:05:48,774 --> 02:05:51,402
Honest people like you
are hard to find these days.

1000
02:05:52,144 --> 02:05:56,240
Sis, there's so much to tell you
about your husband's black money.

1001
02:05:56,782 --> 02:05:58,545
But, don't breathe a
word about it to that D.l.G.

1002
02:05:58,851 --> 02:06:00,751
His face clearly indicates
that this slimy creature...

1003
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:02,888
can go to any extent to
lay his dirty hands onto...

1004
02:06:03,055 --> 02:06:05,023
the wealth and
the woman of another.

1005
02:06:18,804 --> 02:06:21,034
Why are you looking
at me like that for?

1006
02:06:21,273 --> 02:06:23,809
l have never seen
a more beautiful girl than you.

1007
02:06:23,809 --> 02:06:27,768
l too have never seen
a more handsome man than you.

1008
02:06:28,814 --> 02:06:31,908
Your wife must be
so pleased with you.

1009
02:06:32,952 --> 02:06:36,786
Why are you sitting so far off?
Why don't you sit next to me?

1010
02:06:41,226 --> 02:06:44,593
l just adore cops and
army men since my childhood.

1011
02:06:45,831 --> 02:06:48,595
Their masculine body;
their flamboyant posture;...

1012
02:06:49,301 --> 02:06:55,968
their discipline... Wow!
Wish l had married a cop.

1013
02:06:56,842 --> 02:06:59,140
But, my fate had something
else in store for me.

1014
02:06:59,511 --> 02:07:01,809
Seems, you are not too
happy with your husband.

1015
02:07:02,848 --> 02:07:06,147
You guessed it right.
l crave for love.

1016
02:07:06,852 --> 02:07:09,480
And my husband
hits the drink every night...

1017
02:07:09,855 --> 02:07:11,823
and is fast asleep by 8:00.

1018
02:07:12,591 --> 02:07:16,493
And l poor girl can
only cry on my misfortune.

1019
02:07:16,862 --> 02:07:18,727
ls this some kind of a sign?

1020
02:07:20,265 --> 02:07:21,391
Yes madam!

1021
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:23,568
Ramu, take the luggage
to the guest room.

1022
02:07:23,869 --> 02:07:25,632
Okay ma'am.
-See you later. -Nice meeting you.

1023
02:07:25,871 --> 02:07:28,499
Have some rest.
Will talk to you later.

1024
02:07:30,943 --> 02:07:33,173
Let's go Lily.

1025
02:07:35,314 --> 02:07:37,009
God damn you!

1026
02:07:37,249 --> 02:07:40,844
You always get so sociable
whenever you see a young man.

1027
02:07:41,353 --> 02:07:43,116
That girl is very strange.

1028
02:07:43,689 --> 02:07:45,657
What has that old man
brought for you in the bag?

1029
02:07:45,891 --> 02:07:48,325
Nothing much.
Just some clothes from Africa.

1030
02:07:48,494 --> 02:07:49,859
That's all?
- That's it!

1031
02:07:50,229 --> 02:07:52,026
l'm getting late.
Will make a move now.

1032
02:07:52,297 --> 02:07:54,060
See you in the evening.

1033
02:07:59,905 --> 02:08:01,099
Hey, what's this?

1034
02:08:01,306 --> 02:08:03,866
Don't tell me you are
actually going to drink this.

1035
02:08:04,910 --> 02:08:07,606
Circumstances and your company has
aroused this temptation with me.

1036
02:08:08,347 --> 02:08:10,679
l have faced so much
tension in my life that,...

1037
02:08:11,083 --> 02:08:13,244
l think l need a break now.

1038
02:08:13,585 --> 02:08:15,883
Today l feel like freaking out
and enjoying my life to the fullest.

1039
02:08:16,155 --> 02:08:19,886
Your guise sure is not helping me
in pumping up my sexual hormones.

1040
02:08:20,392 --> 02:08:25,625
Don't go on my looks.
Feel the heat.

1041
02:08:26,932 --> 02:08:30,060
What...
What are you doing?

1042
02:08:31,103 --> 02:08:33,697
What the heck do you think
you are doing? Let go of me...

1043
02:08:33,939 --> 02:08:35,907
Come back to your senses!
- How can l?

1044
02:08:36,175 --> 02:08:37,904
Looks like he is here.

1045
02:08:38,143 --> 02:08:41,112
Your moustache! Stick it back!!
- God damn him!

1046
02:08:46,051 --> 02:08:48,576
Booze and only booze! All you
can ever think about is booze.

1047
02:08:49,121 --> 02:08:53,251
For once, how about giving a
thought to your beautiful wife?

1048
02:08:53,692 --> 02:08:57,924
You got all the luxuries you could
ever want. What more do you need?

1049
02:08:58,564 --> 02:09:00,725
All those are not enough
to gratify a woman's needs.

1050
02:09:00,966 --> 02:09:02,934
What do you want me to do?

1051
02:09:03,969 --> 02:09:05,732
l'll surely gratify you tomorrow.

1052
02:13:34,806 --> 02:13:38,207
l curse my life. That
bloody sleep has got you again.

1053
02:13:56,261 --> 02:13:58,889
You!
When did you come?

1054
02:13:59,431 --> 02:14:01,023
You were so right.

1055
02:14:01,333 --> 02:14:03,301
That old man sure
is being very imprudent...

1056
02:14:03,468 --> 02:14:05,561
by putting aside
your emotional needs.

1057
02:14:05,937 --> 02:14:08,906
This is not fair.
- This is my misfortune.

1058
02:14:09,274 --> 02:14:11,139
Why then did you
marry that old haggard?

1059
02:14:11,476 --> 02:14:17,506
l did not. My father got
greedy and sold me off to him.

1060
02:14:19,351 --> 02:14:21,911
And l got neither
the money nor love.

1061
02:14:22,687 --> 02:14:24,917
All he does is shower
his wealth on others.

1062
02:14:25,357 --> 02:14:28,918
Now, whatever was the need to give
5 million to that Mayor's wife?

1063
02:14:29,294 --> 02:14:31,592
What?
He gave her 5 million!

1064
02:14:32,697 --> 02:14:35,257
Oops!
l wasn't supposed to say that.

1065
02:14:37,702 --> 02:14:40,603
Did you just say that your husband
paid the Mayor's wife 5 million?

1066
02:14:41,306 --> 02:14:44,935
l beg of you. Don't say a word
about this to the Mayor's wife.

1067
02:14:45,377 --> 02:14:47,641
My husband had strictly told
me not to say anything to you.

1068
02:14:49,014 --> 02:14:50,982
So, this is it.

1069
02:14:51,416 --> 02:14:55,546
lf only l had
half of that money,...

1070
02:14:55,921 --> 02:14:58,515
l'd kick him off and
run off with another man.

1071
02:15:01,026 --> 02:15:04,792
Wife!... - Seems he's awake.
You'd better leave now.

1072
02:15:05,330 --> 02:15:07,628
l'll meet you
tomorrow morning at 10:00.

1073
02:15:11,703 --> 02:15:13,102
Sister, what are you doing?

1074
02:15:13,405 --> 02:15:16,033
You pressed my mouth so hard;
you could break my teeth, get it!

1075
02:15:16,508 --> 02:15:18,100
What's all this?

1076
02:15:18,343 --> 02:15:20,903
Now you are no longer Rajnikant,
but a businessman, get it!

1077
02:15:21,279 --> 02:15:22,576
Got it.

1078
02:15:23,348 --> 02:15:25,908
Are you ready yet? Have you
explained to him everything.

1079
02:15:26,351 --> 02:15:29,912
l did understand everything, but
l fail to understand the language.

1080
02:15:30,489 --> 02:15:33,322
That thing is
blowing up my mind.

1081
02:15:33,725 --> 02:15:36,694
Mayor's wife is expecting you.
Take her for shopping.

1082
02:15:37,095 --> 02:15:39,063
Our plan will flop
if the D.l.G. comes in.

1083
02:15:39,397 --> 02:15:43,060
God damn him!
l am leaving.

1084
02:15:44,903 --> 02:15:47,337
My dear sister,
take me to such a shop...

1085
02:15:47,772 --> 02:15:50,935
where l can buy things
l'll never find in Africa.

1086
02:15:51,543 --> 02:15:52,510
Get in.

1087
02:15:55,380 --> 02:15:58,076
How was your night?
- l couldn't stop thinking about you

1088
02:15:58,483 --> 02:16:01,008
My condition is the same as yours.

1089
02:16:01,453 --> 02:16:04,354
Can't help it.
Have to bear this.

1090
02:16:04,656 --> 02:16:07,022
God bless you.
- Hello sir.

1091
02:16:07,459 --> 02:16:09,154
How are you?
- l am fine.

1092
02:16:09,394 --> 02:16:11,521
Have you come to meet
the Mayor's wife? - That's right.

1093
02:16:11,730 --> 02:16:16,167
She left for an important business.
Said that it was personal.

1094
02:16:16,835 --> 02:16:18,700
Didn't tell me
exactly what it ways.

1095
02:16:19,070 --> 02:16:22,597
But, why are you all standing?
Please make yourself comfortable.

1096
02:16:27,412 --> 02:16:29,710
What type of dresses would
you prefer for your wife?

1097
02:16:32,817 --> 02:16:35,911
Not this...
Buy whatever you like best.

1098
02:16:37,422 --> 02:16:40,118
Got to make a call.
l'll be right back. - Okay.

1099
02:16:47,432 --> 02:16:50,401
lt's me, Rajnikant speaking.
Has your D.l.G. arrived yet?

1100
02:16:50,902 --> 02:16:53,996
That's right. This is the
Mayor's bungalow. His wife is out.

1101
02:16:54,439 --> 02:16:57,408
What's that? You wished to discuss
something personal with her?

1102
02:17:00,011 --> 02:17:03,412
What's your name?
Wha... Pandey what?

1103
02:17:05,450 --> 02:17:08,010
Oh, l get it!
God bless you!

1104
02:17:08,253 --> 02:17:10,221
l'll convey your messa...
- Just a minute!

1105
02:17:10,455 --> 02:17:12,218
Hello!
lt's me, D.l.G. speaking.

1106
02:17:14,025 --> 02:17:15,083
Take that!

1107
02:17:17,696 --> 02:17:20,096
Sis, l couldn't
speak to my friend.

1108
02:17:20,532 --> 02:17:22,500
Call up your place and inquire...

1109
02:17:22,801 --> 02:17:24,769
if there was any
call for me from Africa.

1110
02:17:24,936 --> 02:17:26,904
You do remember about the other
half of your share, don't you?

1111
02:17:27,038 --> 02:17:28,005
Rightaway.

1112
02:17:28,340 --> 02:17:32,436
Do come to Africa.
You will be our honoured guest.

1113
02:17:32,711 --> 02:17:34,440
l sure will.
- Am l not right?

1114
02:17:34,646 --> 02:17:36,113
Of course!

1115
02:17:39,084 --> 02:17:40,779
Who's speaking?
- So!

1116
02:17:41,152 --> 02:17:43,950
Now you don't
even recognize my voice.

1117
02:17:44,489 --> 02:17:47,947
ls it really you, Mr. D.l.G.?
Was there any call for me?

1118
02:17:48,493 --> 02:17:50,723
There was no call for you.
Where are you calling from?

1119
02:17:52,497 --> 02:17:55,261
l am with my brother-in-law
shopping for his wife.

1120
02:17:55,567 --> 02:17:57,797
What?
He is with you!

1121
02:17:58,069 --> 02:17:59,764
That's right.
He is with me.

1122
02:18:00,505 --> 02:18:02,473
Let me speak to him.

1123
02:18:04,209 --> 02:18:07,178
Brother...

1124
02:18:09,614 --> 02:18:12,082
He was right here.
Don't know where he's gone.

1125
02:18:12,317 --> 02:18:14,649
Never mind!
Will talk to you when you get back.

1126
02:18:14,919 --> 02:18:15,886
Okay.

1127
02:18:21,526 --> 02:18:25,292
Where did you go?
There was no call for you.

1128
02:18:25,864 --> 02:18:28,492
Never mind! We will arrange
the money from somewhere else.

1129
02:18:31,536 --> 02:18:34,164
She is squandering away as
soon as she got some money.

1130
02:18:34,539 --> 02:18:36,507
She is making a fool out of me.

1131
02:18:36,841 --> 02:18:40,174
Good day...
- Who are you?

1132
02:18:40,545 --> 02:18:43,514
l have come from Sachin Dresses
to deliver these goods.

1133
02:18:43,882 --> 02:18:47,318
Mrs. Mayor has bought
these garments from our shop.

1134
02:18:48,553 --> 02:18:52,011
Pants and shirts!
Was anyone else with her?

1135
02:18:53,558 --> 02:18:56,254
No. She was all alone.

1136
02:18:59,631 --> 02:19:02,122
Please ask her to give a call to us
when she gets back.

1137
02:19:02,367 --> 02:19:05,336
Good day to you.
Do pay a visit to our shop.

1138
02:19:06,571 --> 02:19:08,937
Oh my!
l am sorry!

1139
02:19:12,911 --> 02:19:16,210
l am from Nanabhai jewellers.
l want to meet Mrs. Mayor.

1140
02:19:16,581 --> 02:19:19,209
She is not in right now.
- Oh my! What do l do now?

1141
02:19:19,584 --> 02:19:21,347
l wanted to give
this jewellery to her.

1142
02:19:21,586 --> 02:19:23,349
You can give it to me.
l'll give it to her.

1143
02:19:24,589 --> 02:19:27,558
As you may see,
there's a bracelet and a chain.

1144
02:19:29,694 --> 02:19:31,889
l'll take your leave now.
- Okay.

1145
02:19:38,403 --> 02:19:40,132
l am from the Hong Kong travels.

1146
02:19:40,338 --> 02:19:42,568
Mrs. Mayor asked us to
send two tickets for Hong Kong.

1147
02:19:42,941 --> 02:19:45,569
What?
- Here they are.

1148
02:19:45,877 --> 02:19:47,572
Please give them to her.

1149
02:20:02,627 --> 02:20:05,255
What is the matter?
Are you going to Hong Kong?

1150
02:20:05,630 --> 02:20:09,259
lt's nothing of the sort.
- Oh, do go ahead.

1151
02:20:09,968 --> 02:20:11,595
Enjoy yourself.

1152
02:20:12,637 --> 02:20:14,161
l'll be right back.

1153
02:20:15,640 --> 02:20:17,938
You go home. l'll arrange
for the money from somewhere.

1154
02:20:24,849 --> 02:20:27,613
What's wrong?
You look worried.

1155
02:20:28,052 --> 02:20:30,020
lt's nothing.
- Wife!

1156
02:20:30,655 --> 02:20:32,282
Just a minute.
Coming!

1157
02:20:42,267 --> 02:20:44,895
What happened? Why are you
looking at me so angrily?

1158
02:20:45,270 --> 02:20:48,296
A harlot will always be a
harlot is what l am looking at.

1159
02:20:48,673 --> 02:20:50,971
Stop this nonsense!
Remember where you are standing.

1160
02:20:51,342 --> 02:20:52,969
Shut up!
God damn you!

1161
02:20:53,178 --> 02:20:55,373
You pretend to love me
and on the other hand,...

1162
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:57,807
you want to elope
with Chakku Pandey!

1163
02:20:58,016 --> 02:20:59,449
No way!
This is all a lie!

1164
02:20:59,684 --> 02:21:01,652
You are falsely
accusing me for nothing.

1165
02:21:01,853 --> 02:21:04,151
ls that so?
Look at these...

1166
02:21:04,689 --> 02:21:07,249
Look at the gents clothes
you bought for your lover.

1167
02:21:07,692 --> 02:21:10,456
Look at this bracelet. Your
lover's name is engraved on it.

1168
02:21:11,062 --> 02:21:14,122
And these are your
tickets for Hong Kong.

1169
02:21:14,699 --> 02:21:16,667
What have you to say about them?
- l know nothing about them.

1170
02:21:16,901 --> 02:21:19,199
Oh yeah! Then perhaps,
you don't even know that,...

1171
02:21:19,437 --> 02:21:21,667
the businessman gave you
5 million rupees.

1172
02:21:23,408 --> 02:21:26,673
Tell me where all that money is.
- l know nothing. l have no money.

1173
02:21:27,178 --> 02:21:29,840
You very well know that,
where money is involved,...

1174
02:21:30,048 --> 02:21:32,016
l don't even
spare my own father.

1175
02:21:33,718 --> 02:21:37,677
You are nothing.
Now tell me or else,...

1176
02:21:39,390 --> 02:21:41,290
l'll tell you everything.

1177
02:21:49,834 --> 02:21:52,359
l had kept the money right here.
l don't know where they have gone.

1178
02:21:52,804 --> 02:21:55,705
You already delivered it to your
lover and now you're playing possum!

1179
02:21:56,074 --> 02:21:57,507
Let's go to him.

1180
02:21:57,742 --> 02:22:00,370
Today l'll take care of both you
and your lover boy. Come...

1181
02:22:03,081 --> 02:22:04,708
Let's go...

1182
02:22:07,952 --> 02:22:09,715
Are you an animal?

1183
02:22:10,088 --> 02:22:12,386
Mr. D.l.G.! Don't you have
any respects for the Mayor's wife?

1184
02:22:12,757 --> 02:22:14,520
Shut up!
Let me have that 5 million.

1185
02:22:14,859 --> 02:22:17,157
5 million!
What 5 million?

1186
02:22:17,462 --> 02:22:19,430
The very same money
the businessman gave her...

1187
02:22:19,764 --> 02:22:21,459
which she gave them to you.

1188
02:22:21,666 --> 02:22:23,463
This is a lie!
She didn't give me any money.

1189
02:22:23,668 --> 02:22:25,727
Enough of your sham!
l know everything!

1190
02:22:26,104 --> 02:22:29,130
l know that you both are planning to
elope with that money to Hong Kong.

1191
02:22:29,440 --> 02:22:32,409
What nonsense!
- You cheat! Let me have that money.

1192
02:22:32,777 --> 02:22:36,076
Or, l'll shoot you.

1193
02:22:36,648 --> 02:22:38,172
We'll see about that.

1194
02:22:43,788 --> 02:22:47,155
God damn you!
Why are you both fighting?

1195
02:22:47,792 --> 02:22:49,555
How aboutjoining him here?

1196
02:22:51,729 --> 02:22:56,359
l knew you'd fight like
dogs for that much money.

1197
02:22:56,901 --> 02:22:58,391
That's so disgusting!

1198
02:23:04,142 --> 02:23:05,769
So, this was all a setup.

1199
02:23:06,110 --> 02:23:08,908
You guessed it right.
l wanted to get to him.

1200
02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:11,180
l went to prison because of him.

1201
02:23:11,382 --> 02:23:13,577
And now, you will go
to prison because of him.

1202
02:23:31,669 --> 02:23:34,797
Howdy guys! Now, don't
you act too smart with me.

1203
02:23:35,239 --> 02:23:39,335
That's my job because,
Rajnikant is my name.

1204
02:23:41,279 --> 02:23:43,474
Both of you; you look so much alike!
- That's right!

1205
02:23:44,015 --> 02:23:47,815
We may be two but we have
united as one to finish you off.

1206
02:23:48,519 --> 02:23:51,818
Because, our feelings
for this nation is the same.

1207
02:23:52,256 --> 02:23:55,225
Cut the crab and
let's get rid of them.

1208
02:23:58,229 --> 02:24:00,925
Oh my! l am sorry.

1209
02:24:07,972 --> 02:24:09,837
Let's go!

1210
02:24:20,885 --> 02:24:22,182
Help!

1211
02:24:30,762 --> 02:24:35,665
God damn you! Where do you
think you were taking them?

1212
02:24:36,167 --> 02:24:42,265
l was sure you'd leave no stone
unturned in hunting down Pandey.

1213
02:24:42,907 --> 02:24:45,876
l also knew that
your look alike...

1214
02:24:46,411 --> 02:24:49,209
would surely come
here to save your hide.

1215
02:24:49,647 --> 02:24:53,276
What was necessary for me
was to kill you both together.

1216
02:24:53,718 --> 02:24:55,686
My neck would be in the noose
even if one of you had escaped me.

1217
02:24:56,187 --> 02:24:58,883
You both tricked me
for too long.

1218
02:24:59,323 --> 02:25:04,693
One was out and the other was in.
But now, none of that.

1219
02:25:05,263 --> 02:25:09,222
Now, all of you will together
will cut the ticket for hell.

1220
02:25:10,935 --> 02:25:16,305
Hey you hero!
l know all about you.

1221
02:25:17,108 --> 02:25:19,440
What's up?
You seem to be very tensed.

1222
02:25:20,011 --> 02:25:22,241
Got cold feet or what?

1223
02:25:23,014 --> 02:25:26,506
Today, we are going to
have a celebration because,...

1224
02:25:26,951 --> 02:25:29,920
today has proven
quite serendipitous to us.

1225
02:25:30,421 --> 02:25:34,517
You all will be dying here
and the C.M. will be dying there.

1226
02:25:35,126 --> 02:25:37,424
All our enemies
will be destroyed.

1227
02:25:38,062 --> 02:25:41,259
Now, no one can stop me
from becoming the C.M.

1228
02:25:43,067 --> 02:25:45,501
As long as l live, you
can do no harm to the C.M.

1229
02:25:45,870 --> 02:25:49,931
Hey boy, no need
to get so excited about.

1230
02:25:50,975 --> 02:25:53,603
Do you know what day it is today?
Today is the Children's day.

1231
02:25:54,078 --> 02:25:56,672
And you C.M. is visiting
the Blind's school...

1232
02:25:56,981 --> 02:26:00,473
to inaugurate the scheme
of ''Free milk to every child''.

1233
02:26:00,985 --> 02:26:04,284
Our men will add
poison in that very milk.

1234
02:26:04,655 --> 02:26:08,751
Your C.M. too will drink that
very milk alongwith the handicaps.

1235
02:26:09,193 --> 02:26:15,098
Your C.M. will kick the
bucket without any bloodshed.

1236
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:16,965
Boasting around!

1237
02:26:18,536 --> 02:26:20,504
What the hell are you saying?

1238
02:26:21,072 --> 02:26:25,509
l'd have kicked you if
you hadn't been my guru.

1239
02:26:26,010 --> 02:26:28,137
Whatever was the need for
you to brief him of our plan?

1240
02:26:28,412 --> 02:26:30,778
What are you staring at?
Kill them all!

1241
02:26:31,516 --> 02:26:33,313
Uncle Help!

1242
02:26:42,593 --> 02:26:43,787
Uncle...

1243
02:26:45,596 --> 02:26:46,528
Mom...

1244
02:27:05,483 --> 02:27:07,007
Suraj help!

1245
02:29:09,440 --> 02:29:11,806
We are getting late.
- Oh yes!

1246
02:29:12,176 --> 02:29:14,804
lt's time for the C.M.
to be kicking the bucket.

1247
02:29:15,279 --> 02:29:19,147
Don't you move from this place
until they don't burn down to ashes.

1248
02:29:19,517 --> 02:29:21,747
l want to make sure
that they are really dead.

1249
02:32:00,344 --> 02:32:01,868
Go on sister...

1250
02:32:59,403 --> 02:33:03,362
Kill him...

1251
02:33:06,410 --> 02:33:09,709
Kill him...
- No...

1252
02:33:19,023 --> 02:33:19,990
No.
