My boss hasn't come

Where is he now?

21
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:58,819
Don't know.

00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:01,037
Hi Mr.Narayan, Beer or whisky?

Aye ask for quality ones.

00:03:15,343 --> 00:03:17,943
Even in an hour he
won’t return isn’t it?

28
00:03:18,088 --> 00:03:20,788
Guarantee he won’t get back.
The bar is very far from here.

29
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:24,809
Chandra, Tonight’s
party is here.

00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,930

Naani don’t be scared.

33
00:03:39,374 --> 00:03:41,374
Raid and search things
don’t happen here!

34
00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:43,395
Hmmm..we are in the police
department, is it not?

35
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,416
We also get scared sometimes.

36
00:03:45,418 --> 00:03:47,418
What man Cable Babu.
How are you? Are you ok?

37
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,439

Aye,ask him to send good ones.

39
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,481
What if he sends some
superficial shiny ones!

40
00:03:55,493 --> 00:03:56,893
I’m a strict officer.

41
00:03:58,085 --> 00:04:02,879
Wearing the uniform, I won’t booze, nor
indulge in any perverse activities.

42
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,700
Mr.Govinda damn. A
smart chap you’re man.

43
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,747
You are always youthful
and don’t get older.

44
00:04:08,768 --> 00:04:12,435
I won’t spare any one. I will
disclose about everyone.

45
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,823
No one asked me to speak.
Still I will say it.

46
00:04:18,413 --> 00:04:20,346
Loafer, that man! My officer!

47
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:24,701
Rs 40 million! How it came here?
That also I will reveal.

48
00:04:24,755 --> 00:04:25,822
Recording start!

49
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,543
Nisha of Mangaluru drug empress

50
00:04:29,997 --> 00:04:32,064
Nisha of Mangaluru drug empress

51
00:04:32,418 --> 00:04:33,418
Sexy!

52
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:38,039
Her gang was in the drug mafia.
Number 1in that area.

53
00:04:43,204 --> 00:04:46,429
In her drug dealings, she
never cared for any one.

54
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,250
She has dare-devil members.

55
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,353
If we raid her den, we get drugs!
that was the news!

56
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:04,308
Our officer got
together 3 Man team.

57
00:05:06,067 --> 00:05:09,734
I team up with Chandra and Swamy.
We raided the place.

58
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:18,872
The confiscated drug was declared as
only Rs 10 million to the government.

59
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:23,061
I handled the disposal of rest
of the drugs and the gold.

60
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,753
After the disposal, we
got this Rs.40 million.

61
00:05:27,222 --> 00:05:30,289
We brought here and
hid in the well!The same!

62
00:05:30,447 --> 00:05:32,447
My officer is a big scoundrel.

63
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,610
While Nisha gang was being
produced in the court,

64
00:05:36,631 --> 00:05:38,564
he claimed that they escaped.

65
00:05:40,552 --> 00:05:43,485
He shot and killed them
in the rose garden.

66
00:05:44,673 --> 00:05:46,740
He threw them in a compost pit!

67
00:05:50,461 --> 00:05:53,391
He looks like a Physical
training school teacher.

68
00:05:53,412 --> 00:05:55,945
but he is a brutal
and cruel officer.

69
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,500
These types of officers
should be transferred to

70
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:00,321
 ..a place that has
no water or shade.

71
00:06:00,342 --> 00:06:02,042
Chandra, come, let us booze.

72
00:06:02,063 --> 00:06:03,263
Wear your cloths man!

73
00:06:03,284 --> 00:06:05,284
You’re totally drunk and
also teasing someone!

74
00:06:05,305 --> 00:06:08,172
Who else, Chandra, it’s
about our officer.

75
00:06:09,175 --> 00:06:11,308
Our officer is a selfish person.

76
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,527
He’s not trustworthy!
That rascal!

77
00:06:13,548 --> 00:06:16,348
He will jack everyone,
that son of a gun!

78
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,620
Hello!

79
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:27,241
He’s a treacherous officer.
That rogue.

80
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:30,579
Out of Rs 40 million confiscated
money, 70% is his share!

81
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,667
I believe and only 30% is ours!

82
00:06:32,802 --> 00:06:34,581
How can this be
deemed fair, Chandra?

83
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,602
The deal was completely
executed by us.

84
00:06:36,623 --> 00:06:38,290
You alone are enough man!

85
00:06:38,644 --> 00:06:40,444
We can do away with
Rs.40 million.

86
00:06:40,465 --> 00:06:42,465
I can’t count all
that alone man!

87
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,486
I love you. Listen to this chap!

88
00:06:44,507 --> 00:06:47,507
Chandra,If you want, add
NANI to our circle.

89
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,517
Got it?

90
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:52,038
I will pee and return.
You come to a decision.

91
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:54,526
Rs 40 million Chandra,
don’t forget.

92
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,739
Did you hear everything, sir?

93
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,460
See Mr.Chandrashekar!
Sir!

94
00:07:01,481 --> 00:07:05,081
What he wants to blabber,
allow him to talk. Yes sir!

95
00:07:05,102 --> 00:07:07,102
Later, I will tell you
what has to be done!

96
00:07:07,123 --> 00:07:08,123
Fine sir, Ok.

97
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:12,258
Aye, chandra!

98
00:07:21,783 --> 00:07:22,983
Where has he gone?

99
00:07:23,804 --> 00:07:24,804
Aye, chandra!

100
00:07:28,962 --> 00:07:31,095
Golden jasmine.
Nice fragrance.

101
00:07:32,358 --> 00:07:34,673
I was telling the tale
of the rose garden.

102
00:07:34,694 --> 00:07:36,494
Where did I keep my mobile?

103
00:07:37,015 --> 00:07:38,348
Oh! It’s right here.

104
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:40,436
It’s still recording!

105
00:08:17,704 --> 00:08:19,804
8 Months Later

106
00:08:22,031 --> 00:08:23,210
About the money to whom all ..

107
00:08:23,231 --> 00:08:24,879
..have you narrated
the story to oh!

108
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,900
Open your mouth,
you bloody bugger.

109
00:08:26,921 --> 00:08:28,921
You bloody idiot, you
can’t be trusted.

110
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,942
To who have you
narrated the story.

111
00:08:30,963 --> 00:08:32,963
What is this man? You are
holding flowers and all.

112
00:08:32,984 --> 00:08:35,117
Which babe does it belong, dude?

113
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:41,325
Director Suri’s
-GOLDEN JASMINE-

114
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,162
Why I’m crying.

115
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,340
Beloved!

116
00:10:53,405 --> 00:10:55,805
When you’re working you should
be conscious of your actions.

117
00:10:55,826 --> 00:10:56,826
Sorry madam!

118
00:10:59,317 --> 00:11:00,517
How was the movie?

119
00:11:01,338 --> 00:11:02,338
Hello!

120
00:11:04,913 --> 00:11:06,713
How was the movie?
I said.

121
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:07,934
It was nice.

122
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:14,289
Hello!

123
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,357
I saw your message.

124
00:11:18,643 --> 00:11:20,643
Will it be ok, if I
come around 8.40 p.m.?

125
00:11:20,664 --> 00:11:21,664
It's ok.Fine!

126
00:11:24,371 --> 00:11:26,838
Let that be there.
Take another one.

127
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,790
Baby, I’m going out now.

128
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:37,211
It will be late by
the time I return.

129
00:11:37,232 --> 00:11:38,565
Ok you go and sleep.

130
00:11:39,253 --> 00:11:41,120
Good night.
-Good night ma.

131
00:12:06,742 --> 00:12:07,942
It’s just a phase.

132
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,983
It’s quite common these days.

133
00:12:11,004 --> 00:12:12,702
She will get over it.
Don’t worry.

134
00:12:12,723 --> 00:12:14,123
She’s very impulsive.

135
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:16,871
If the balance dips. I’m
worried about that!

136
00:12:16,892 --> 00:12:18,568
What do you know about that boy?

137
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:21,193
He is a low level employee
working in our company.

138
00:12:21,214 --> 00:12:23,714
He has no one to call as his own.
No relatives.

139
00:12:23,735 --> 00:12:24,735
Status problem!

140
00:12:26,087 --> 00:12:27,087
What to do?

141
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,692
It sounds untrue!

142
00:12:29,035 --> 00:12:32,902
I just have one daughter. She
has to be happy that’s all.

143
00:12:33,415 --> 00:12:35,308
Shall I summon him
and have a chat?

144
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:36,329
It won’t work.

145
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,083
Please do something!

146
00:12:39,822 --> 00:12:43,222
I will give it some thought;
Give me a day’s time.

147
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:44,843
Thank you.

148
00:13:03,474 --> 00:13:04,474
Raja!
Sir!

149
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:09,362
In an half an hour I will come
at the Mosque behind the market.

150
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:20,894
Keep him right there!

151
00:13:21,171 --> 00:13:23,389
Keep that idiot in
Chitradurga city.

152
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,031
Don’t bring him to Bengaluru.
-ok sir.

153
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:28,519
When the program will
materialize, I will tell you.

154
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,232
Do you need a joint
or something, friend?

155
00:13:58,253 --> 00:13:59,786
Roll it in a cigarette.

156
00:14:02,317 --> 00:14:03,917
Special cigarette, dude.

157
00:14:04,262 --> 00:14:05,886
Leave it dude, I don’t smoke it.

158
00:14:05,907 --> 00:14:07,889
Hey Kaatu! My partner sir.
“Marijuana” business.

159
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,212
What my dear? What do
you have in your bag?

160
00:14:10,233 --> 00:14:11,712
What man? Are you
selling Marijuana?

161
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:13,613
Who are you all? Why
you're checking my bag?

162
00:14:13,634 --> 00:14:15,814
Are you selling Marijuana?
Keep walking you scoundrel.

163
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:17,875
Why you're hitting me, sir?
-I will straighten you now!

164
00:14:17,896 --> 00:14:19,229
Don’t simply hit us.

165
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:20,984
There! Leave me!

166
00:14:27,858 --> 00:14:28,858
Police station.

167
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:39,962
What’s your name?

168
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:41,850
Ravindra.

169
00:14:44,715 --> 00:14:45,982
Which is your city?

170
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,136
Mandya sir.

171
00:14:47,457 --> 00:14:48,644
Don’t hit me please! Madam!

172
00:14:48,665 --> 00:14:49,665
Parents?

173
00:14:50,086 --> 00:14:51,553
Mahdevappa, Shantawwa.

174
00:14:52,107 --> 00:14:54,907
When have you started
this drug business?

175
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,533
Which business? I don’t know.

176
00:14:57,621 --> 00:14:59,621
Since when do you know this guy?

177
00:14:59,642 --> 00:15:02,775
Since 2 weeks. He’s buying
drugs from me, sir.

178
00:15:02,843 --> 00:15:03,843
Trash him!

179
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,110
Sir!

180
00:15:30,153 --> 00:15:32,286
According to section 21/NDPS Act

Sir! Sir!

00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,258
Shut the hell up and keep quiet.

186
00:16:39,283 --> 00:16:40,963

Keep quiet you rogue!

188
00:16:43,005 --> 00:16:45,605
Sir, my mother promise I don’t
indulge in such things, sir.

189
00:16:45,626 --> 00:16:46,959

Sir, I am not guilty!

193
00:16:55,037 --> 00:16:59,104
How dare you aim the gun at me?
You scoundrel, lower it now!

194
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:32,271
Hear this out Raju?

195
00:18:32,325 --> 00:18:34,325
The post mortem report
will be like this!

196
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,846
As the bullet is pierced in
between the ear and the eye

197
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:38,667
..through the temple region.

198
00:18:38,688 --> 00:18:40,688
That’s why the face
was blasted and..

199
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:44,042
could not be identified.
This will be the report.

200
00:18:48,012 --> 00:18:49,879
Mr.Swaminath.
-Tell me sir!

201
00:18:54,244 --> 00:18:55,244
Ok, sir!

202
00:18:58,796 --> 00:19:01,198
Hello! Gowri!

00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:02,619
Aye Ravi.
Where are you my dear?

204
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,874
Since morning I’ve been calling you,
not reachable is what it states..

205
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:06,260
Which number is this?

206
00:19:06,281 --> 00:19:07,379
Aiyyoo! I don’t have a phone now!.

207
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,706
The cops have
snatched it from me

208
00:19:08,727 --> 00:19:10,060
What are you saying?

209
00:19:10,248 --> 00:19:12,432
Since morning what’s
happening is beyond me!

210
00:19:12,453 --> 00:19:14,371
In a marijuana case I’ve
been fixed by the police.

211
00:19:14,392 --> 00:19:15,892
Gowri, I shot a policeman.

212
00:19:15,913 --> 00:19:17,913
Now tell me that where are you?

213
00:19:17,934 --> 00:19:20,534
Aye Aye taking my phone,
where are you rushing to?

214
00:19:20,555 --> 00:19:22,555

You don’t go any where.
Be there. I’m coming.

218
00:19:30,139 --> 00:19:33,139
Gowri, the cops will kill me Gowri.
I need some money Gowri.

00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,827
Yes dear. I’m getting it.

220
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:37,381
 You don’t go anywhere.
Be right there!

221
00:19:37,402 --> 00:19:40,402
-Sir, can you return the phone?
I will miss my bus!

222
00:19:40,423 --> 00:19:41,423

How much time it will take?-About
half an hour to an hour.

235
00:20:19,122 --> 00:20:20,655
Come fast! Ok mom! Bye.

236
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:16,810
Who gave this gun to you?

237
00:21:16,964 --> 00:21:19,808
Since morning what’s
happening is beyond me!

238
00:21:19,829 --> 00:21:21,362
Please don’t cry, Ravi.

239
00:21:22,288 --> 00:21:24,388
Now what are you
planning on doing?

240
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:25,909
I want to leave
this city and go.

241
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,530
Come, I too will join you.
-Please understand me!

242
00:21:28,551 --> 00:21:30,651
Just give me some
money that’s all.

243
00:21:30,672 --> 00:21:33,005
I will go and somehow
hide myself.

I am coming with you. That’s it.

279
00:24:53,928 --> 00:24:55,389
Why did you bother coming?

280
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,399
I came to give you
the gun and go.

Hello Mrs.Shetty!
Don't worry!

288
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:42,398
The boy will not interfere with
your daughter’s life again.

289
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,219
I am least bothered about him!

290
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,240
This evening Gowri went with
her friend for shopping.

291
00:25:47,261 --> 00:25:49,061
She has withdrawn Rs.15,000

292
00:25:49,412 --> 00:25:52,401
I just called Gowri and her
phone is switched off.

293
00:25:52,422 --> 00:25:56,899
I called her friend and she is lying that
she has no clues as to her whereabouts.

294
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,429
Give me that friend number.
I will talk to her.

295
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,450
I will text to you right away.

296
00:26:02,941 --> 00:26:05,568
I am the Deputy Commissioner
of police speaking.-Yes sir!

297
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:08,389
Now where is Gowri?
-I have no idea, sir.

298
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,070
This is a police matter.

299
00:26:10,471 --> 00:26:14,164
If something bad befalls her and
it turns out that you’re involved.

300
00:26:14,185 --> 00:26:16,407
For you, it will be
a problem later.

301
00:26:16,428 --> 00:26:19,313
Like a court case, do you
want to get in to all this?

302
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:20,467
Where is she now?

303
00:26:21,055 --> 00:26:23,355
Sir, it’s like she went
in the Hyderabad Bus.

304
00:26:23,376 --> 00:26:26,109
With whom? -With her
Ravi too went, sir.

305
00:26:26,761 --> 00:26:29,461
You should have revealed all
of this earlier itself.

306
00:26:29,482 --> 00:26:32,415
Small children, you
should be more careful.

307
00:26:36,031 --> 00:26:39,264
She has boarded the Hyderabad
bus with her friend.

308
00:26:39,285 --> 00:26:42,703
She will be back by morning.
Please you don’t worry.

309
00:26:42,724 --> 00:26:45,324
For no reason my daughter’s
safety should be compromised.

310
00:26:45,345 --> 00:26:47,212
That responsibility is mine.

311
00:26:47,366 --> 00:26:48,366
Police station.

312
00:26:55,995 --> 00:26:57,543
Sir, I’ve just returned
from Tirupathi.

313
00:26:57,564 --> 00:27:01,364
I’ll understand the matter in
depth and inform you, sir.

314
00:27:07,931 --> 00:27:09,631
Are there any eye witnesses?

315
00:27:09,652 --> 00:27:10,652
None sir!

316
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,173
We enquired about the boy.It’s
said that he is very well behaved.

317
00:27:14,194 --> 00:27:16,598
Since how many years
are you in service?

318
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:17,826
Answer to the point.

319
00:27:17,847 --> 00:27:20,143
He has shot a Police
Inspector and escaped.

320
00:27:20,164 --> 00:27:23,050
You think this is a joke. Stating
he’s not like that and well behaved.

321
00:27:23,071 --> 00:27:24,728
Before commits another
crime, he has to be caught.

322
00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:27,216
He has a weapon in hand.
-Sorry sir!

323
00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:29,919
Is there any other
case against him?

324
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,074
No sir! This is his
first fresh case.

325
00:27:32,095 --> 00:27:35,756
Fine! whatever the regular procedure,
you just follow it. Ok sir!

326
00:27:35,777 --> 00:27:39,277
The core focus should be on bus
stand, Railways station and highways.

327
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:40,565
Check them! Ok sir!

328
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,299
Where are the seized items?
--It is in that station.

329
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,920
I want them everything
in the morning.

330
00:27:58,308 --> 00:28:00,408
Please change the route. Police
got information -by Sindhu

331
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,864
Sindhu has sent this message.
-What!?

332
00:28:02,885 --> 00:28:04,752
We have to change the route!

333
00:28:04,906 --> 00:28:07,506
The police have come
to know about us!

334
00:28:12,327 --> 00:28:14,289
We will be stationed
for half an hour!

335
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,310
Those who want to
dine please do so.

336
00:28:16,331 --> 00:28:18,264
We won’t stop anywhere ahead!

337
00:28:25,074 --> 00:28:26,074
There!

338
00:28:27,524 --> 00:28:29,224
Come, we will check that side.

339
00:28:29,245 --> 00:28:30,745
Shall we board another bus?

340
00:28:30,766 --> 00:28:32,633
Not towards Hyderabad, come!

341
00:28:32,787 --> 00:28:33,787
Where to?

342
00:28:34,008 --> 00:28:36,075
We will change the route, baby.

343
00:28:40,975 --> 00:28:43,659
I am unable to walk. Shall
we ask for a drop?

344
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,303
To where shall we
ask for a drop?

345
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,124
Some vehicle is nearing.
Stop it!

346
00:28:47,145 --> 00:28:48,945
Stop! Stop! Stop! Aye

347
00:28:48,966 --> 00:28:49,966
Aye you moron!

348
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:58,619
Ask whether he will go
till the main road?

349
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,540
Sir, will you drop us
till the main road?

350
00:29:00,561 --> 00:29:02,028
I will drop you. Come!

351
00:29:08,182 --> 00:29:09,182
(Screams)

352
00:29:15,193 --> 00:29:16,260
Uncle, get down!

353
00:29:17,014 --> 00:29:19,614
What is this? You’re showing a gun and all.
What happened?

354
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:20,768
I will shoot you.

355
00:29:21,656 --> 00:29:22,656
My car! My car!

356
00:29:25,242 --> 00:29:27,242
Finally my wife got kidnapped!

357
00:29:30,011 --> 00:29:32,500
SHARADHA! Hope nothing
happened to you!?

358
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,801
What kind of a cowardly husband are you?
without a care.

359
00:29:34,822 --> 00:29:36,802
Leaving me alone in the car.
You’re without a care.

360
00:29:36,823 --> 00:29:38,556
My car is gone! It’s gone.

361
00:30:01,417 --> 00:30:02,996
Wait! I will ask them and come.

362
00:30:03,017 --> 00:30:04,799
They will all be drunk.
You don’t understand.

363
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,620
I will ask them and return.

364
00:30:10,621 --> 00:30:12,602
Brother, how to
reach the highway?

365
00:30:12,623 --> 00:30:14,623
Go straight ahead. You
will get a Banayan tree.

366
00:30:14,644 --> 00:30:17,511
Take a left turn and
there is the highway.

367
00:30:18,495 --> 00:30:23,162
If you take a left turn near Dabaspet,
the highway starts from there.

368
00:30:51,054 --> 00:30:53,787
Chinni, at the toll
gate they might check.

369
00:30:53,808 --> 00:30:55,008
Go back and sleep.

370
00:31:13,452 --> 00:31:14,585
Brother! Brother!

371
00:31:14,882 --> 00:31:15,862
What is it?

372
00:31:15,883 --> 00:31:16,863
We want a room

373
00:31:16,884 --> 00:31:17,864
There is no room!

374
00:31:17,885 --> 00:31:18,885
Check please!

375
00:31:19,506 --> 00:31:20,506
I am checking.

376
00:31:21,011 --> 00:31:22,583
For how many days, madam?

377
00:31:22,604 --> 00:31:23,604
For an hour.

378
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:24,925
Partner.

379
00:31:28,315 --> 00:31:30,911
For an hour they want room.
A customer is here.

380
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:33,465
Take Rs.400 and give
them a room man.

381
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:38,663
What's your name?

382
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,740
Shankar.

383
00:31:39,861 --> 00:31:40,861
Okay.

384
00:32:00,882 --> 00:32:01,882
Hey is it done?

385
00:32:02,703 --> 00:32:05,636
How much time do you
need to open the door?

386
00:32:07,623 --> 00:32:09,756
Hey stop! First I have to go in.

387
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:27,777
It's really bad man..the toilet!

00:32:49,659 --> 00:32:50,926
Which is this soap?

395
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,177
Famous soap, madam!

396
00:32:52,198 --> 00:32:53,279
I don't use all this!

397
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,321
If I pay money, will you bring
another soap & Shampoo?

398
00:32:55,342 --> 00:32:56,342
Sure, I will.

399
00:32:56,363 --> 00:32:57,763
The shop will open much later.

400
00:32:57,784 --> 00:32:59,984
Bring 2 cups of hot coffee.

401
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,535

00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:44,375
Sir, Ravi showed the gun to
someone and stole the car.

406
00:33:44,396 --> 00:33:46,367
The chikkaballapura
inspector was saying.

407
00:33:46,388 --> 00:33:48,433
He's on the line.
Do talk to him.

408
00:33:48,454 --> 00:33:49,454
Hello!

409
00:33:49,491 --> 00:33:50,474
Good morning, sir!

410
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,057
A case has been
brought in here, sir!

411
00:33:52,078 --> 00:33:54,078
Give the phone to the car
owner if he is there.

412
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:55,432
Sir, greetings, sir.

413
00:33:55,507 --> 00:33:57,407
Greetings.
-Did you see the guy?

414
00:33:57,428 --> 00:33:58,428
Sir, I saw him!

415
00:33:58,749 --> 00:34:00,049
That boy is this guy only, sir.

416
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,203
He is a good boy.

417
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:02,851
With him there was a girl, sir.

418
00:34:02,872 --> 00:34:06,170
She pointed gun at me and stole
the car and went away, sir.

419
00:34:06,191 --> 00:34:08,258
A girl? How was she to look at?

420
00:34:08,323 --> 00:34:10,423
She was fair and quite
good looking, sir.

421
00:34:10,444 --> 00:34:11,644
Let her be buried!

422
00:34:12,465 --> 00:34:15,065
Some girl pointed gun at
you and you gave the car.

423
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:17,486
With great difficulty that
car was bought.Hello! Hello!

424
00:34:17,507 --> 00:34:18,507
Tell me sir!

425
00:34:18,971 --> 00:34:21,058
Driving the car, which
way did they go?

426
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:22,658
They went towards,
Bengaluru Sir.

427
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,984
Give the phone to
the police officer.

428
00:34:24,005 --> 00:34:27,605
In that car, my wife's 2
sarees and my clothes were all kept.

00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:49,498
Do you know who this girl is?

434
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:50,833
Investigate it!

435
00:34:51,854 --> 00:34:53,054
Oh! No Love birds!

436
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:55,742
This is a parrot chick case!

437
00:34:59,196 --> 00:35:03,869
Last night this car has passed Tumakuru
toll as per the information we got!

438
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:09,423
Stop the check everywhere and intensify the
check on the Bengaluru-Poona High way.

439
00:35:14,335 --> 00:35:16,607
If we ask our room boy we
will come to know sir.

440
00:35:16,628 --> 00:35:17,828
Pravi..sir ..coming.

441
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,049
Does the CCTV work? Can
we see the footage?

442
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,879
CCTV is spoiled
since 2 days sir!

443
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,592
Sir, this morning I saw
him in the TV news.

444
00:35:23,613 --> 00:35:25,013
Check properly before you talk..

445
00:35:25,034 --> 00:35:26,334
Sure..this is the boy!

446
00:35:26,355 --> 00:35:27,955
He had picked up a girl
and had come here..

447
00:35:27,976 --> 00:35:29,504
She was wearing shorts.

448
00:35:29,525 --> 00:35:30,809
They asked me to get coffee.

449
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,460
but by the time I went
and returned with the

450
00:35:32,481 --> 00:35:34,114
coffee,they drove the
car and went away, sir.

451
00:35:34,135 --> 00:35:36,452
Which way? -They went
towards Bengaluru, sir.

452
00:35:36,473 --> 00:35:38,773
Sir, I am police
Inspector from Hiriyuru.

453
00:35:38,794 --> 00:35:42,557
Sir, the girl and the boy, as they left
towards Bengaluru as found out at the hotel.

454
00:35:42,578 --> 00:35:44,678
Why are you again heading
towards Bengaluru man?

455
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:47,499
You wait and watch
what I am going to do!

456
00:35:51,272 --> 00:35:53,272
Leave the high way and
head towards the village.

457
00:35:53,293 --> 00:35:55,693
It’s safe.I told you last
night.Now you're realising.

458
00:35:55,714 --> 00:35:57,114
The brake has failed!

459
00:36:17,229 --> 00:36:18,229
Hello chinni!

460
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:20,778
What happened man?

461
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,426
I asked why you're heading
towards Bengaluru?

462
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:24,747
But you have parked
the car here!

463
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:25,668
Are you crazy?

464
00:36:25,689 --> 00:36:27,289
Haven't I parked
the car properly?

465
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,510
You don't know driving and
you will also not learn.

466
00:36:29,531 --> 00:36:31,619
You go back to Bengaluru.I
will put you on a bus.

467
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,996
I will go to Hyderabad
and somehow I lie low.

468
00:36:33,017 --> 00:36:35,017
Is Hyderabad on another planet?

469
00:36:35,038 --> 00:36:38,426
If you make one false move, you
will get caught everywhere.

470
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:41,147
Else with a godesses of luck
like me, you will be safe.

471
00:36:41,168 --> 00:36:42,701
Aiyyo your luck and me!

472
00:36:43,189 --> 00:36:44,589
Aye chinni! wait man!

473
00:36:46,283 --> 00:36:47,683
Why are you so tense?

474
00:36:48,304 --> 00:36:52,200
I am dying here and you are unable
to understand my problem.Is that so?

475
00:36:52,221 --> 00:36:54,521
Just a word! The people who
bombed and raped are relaxed!

476
00:36:54,542 --> 00:36:57,242
What is your problem now?
Will you kindly shut up and silent!

477
00:36:57,263 --> 00:36:58,663
What is open to shut?

478
00:37:00,946 --> 00:37:03,279
Ok.. I am able to
understand your problem.

479
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,300
Do one thing.

480
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,630
I will give you a water bottle.

481
00:37:06,651 --> 00:37:09,894
Hold that and go near the bush
and finish your work and come.

482
00:37:09,915 --> 00:37:11,715
Why did you bring the
car here and stop!

483
00:37:11,736 --> 00:37:13,636
Ayyyoo if it's with us,
it's a big burden.

484
00:37:13,657 --> 00:37:15,157
Understand that, nutcase!

485
00:37:15,178 --> 00:37:17,778
You do anything and die.But
don't come with me!

486
00:37:17,799 --> 00:37:19,266
Ravi! wait for me man!

487
00:37:22,008 --> 00:37:23,741
Wait! Let us die together.

488
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:27,804
I beleive that girl is shakuntala
shetty's daughter, sir.

489
00:37:27,825 --> 00:37:30,859
That boy too working in her
mother's company, sir.

490
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,280
Please take Shakuntala
shetty's phone number, sir.

491
00:37:39,418 --> 00:37:41,351
Police commissioner’s office.

492
00:37:42,443 --> 00:37:43,443
Hello!

493
00:37:43,664 --> 00:37:44,664
Suryakanth.

494
00:37:44,768 --> 00:37:47,429
Purandhar, ACP (Assistant commissioner
of police) has called me.

495
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,050
And he enquired about Gowri

496
00:37:49,071 --> 00:37:51,371
He is probably
investigating the case.

497
00:37:51,392 --> 00:37:52,859
What did you tell him?

498
00:37:53,013 --> 00:37:55,213
I asked him not to
publicize the case.

499
00:37:55,234 --> 00:37:57,434
I think he understood
my dilemma.

500
00:37:57,455 --> 00:38:00,256
Have you found out anything
about my daughter?

501
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:03,277
Please don’t worry about your daughter.
Nothing will befall her.

502
00:38:03,298 --> 00:38:05,698
Let that responsibility
rest on me.

503
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,580
Sir!

504
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:10,372
That sub inspector Govindraju’s case,

505
00:38:10,393 --> 00:38:13,105
which is being handled
by ACP Purandhar..

506
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:15,726
Find out who are all there
in his team and find out.

507
00:38:15,747 --> 00:38:16,747
Okay sir!

508
00:38:26,796 --> 00:38:28,729
“Decorative lamps in my eyes”

509
00:38:32,308 --> 00:38:34,175
“Fortunes are in our pocket”

510
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:40,062
“Without a sound, the
town has vanished”

511
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:45,617
“A few wishes, I will hold,
as they are with me”

512
00:38:47,371 --> 00:38:50,504
“Is there any fault, if
love does envelop me?”

513
00:38:52,392 --> 00:38:54,392
“The heart is a bag of pearls”

514
00:38:57,413 --> 00:38:58,413
“Gifted by you”

515
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,287
“Walk me in your dreams,
when it is sunny”

516
00:39:08,726 --> 00:39:11,326
“Serve me your love
if hunger strikes”

517
00:39:16,304 --> 00:39:18,384
Madam, Is there any
room available?

518
00:39:18,405 --> 00:39:19,385
Where are you from?

519
00:39:19,406 --> 00:39:20,346
From Bengaluru.

520
00:39:20,367 --> 00:39:21,500
Why are you here?

521
00:39:21,588 --> 00:39:23,269
To see Chitradurga fort, sir.

522
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,799
Please pass your ID
proof if you have it.

523
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,120
Do you have it?
-No!

524
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:27,620
Without Identification
proof, we can't give room!

525
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:29,574
There are no rooms available.

526
00:39:38,174 --> 00:39:41,174
Chinni, To get a room, we need
an identification proof like..

527
00:39:41,195 --> 00:39:43,595
 marriage Chain around
the neck or luggage.

528
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,096
You look like a piece
of luggage only.

529
00:39:45,117 --> 00:39:46,549
Still why they are not
giving us a room?

530
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:49,070
Gowri, If I get angry I myself
don't know what I will do!?

531
00:39:49,091 --> 00:39:50,771
I am watching you since 6 months.

532
00:39:50,792 --> 00:39:52,459
You will not do anything.

533
00:39:52,813 --> 00:39:54,613
Let us do one this!
-What?

534
00:39:54,834 --> 00:39:56,034
In the same lodge,

535
00:39:56,409 --> 00:39:58,409
You get a seperate room
and I get a seperate one!

536
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:00,430
Then we both stay
in the same room.

537
00:40:00,451 --> 00:40:02,451
First time we are getting
in the room, Ravi.

538
00:40:02,472 --> 00:40:03,805
I am sure about you.

539
00:40:04,475 --> 00:40:06,493
But I am not sure about myself.

540
00:40:06,514 --> 00:40:09,671
If something goes wrong, I
will file a case against you.

541
00:40:09,692 --> 00:40:11,674
First of all I am embroiled
in a murder case.

542
00:40:11,695 --> 00:40:13,675
Kidnapping one. Now a
rape case from your end!

543
00:40:13,696 --> 00:40:15,277
Both mother and
daughter have together..

544
00:40:15,298 --> 00:40:17,398
decided to put up in the
gallows, is that not?

545
00:40:17,419 --> 00:40:18,801
Write your address
and sign here.

546
00:40:18,822 --> 00:40:19,922
Give to me. I will write.

547
00:40:19,943 --> 00:40:21,943
Please pay Rs.1000
as an advance.

548
00:40:21,964 --> 00:40:22,964
Where is the room, sir?

549
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:24,652
First floor.Room no. 105.

550
00:40:43,136 --> 00:40:44,336
I don't want this.

551
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,510
Order whatever you want.

552
00:40:46,931 --> 00:40:49,431
I feel like eating schezwan
fried rice or Mexican dishes.

553
00:40:49,452 --> 00:40:51,752
In Chitradurga where do we
get Mexican dishes, girl?

554
00:40:51,773 --> 00:40:53,857
Eat this only. We have to leave.

555
00:40:53,878 --> 00:40:57,345
What are you saying? I am
tired and feeling sleepy.

556
00:40:57,687 --> 00:40:59,687
You have a siesta program too?

557
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:02,351
Aye..when I am asleep,
if you desert me.

558
00:41:02,372 --> 00:41:03,861
Surely I will die, that's all.

559
00:41:03,882 --> 00:41:05,461
Aiyyoo! I won't go
anywhere, Gowri!

560
00:41:05,482 --> 00:41:06,815
I am going to sleep.

561
00:41:12,691 --> 00:41:15,014
Sir, I am Sub Inspector
speaking from Hiriyuru town.

562
00:41:15,035 --> 00:41:17,335
The car they stole is
abandoned next to

563
00:41:17,356 --> 00:41:20,423
Hiriyuru -Tumukuru Highway
near a ditch, sir.

564
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:24,409
Is there any clue inside the car?
Do check!

565
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,830
Sir, we have searched the car.

566
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:28,718
Other than 2 bags we
found nothing inside.

567
00:42:09,653 --> 00:42:10,797
Karnataka police
Intelligence department.

568
00:42:10,818 --> 00:42:12,218
Anitha, your husband.

569
00:42:13,173 --> 00:42:14,173
I am coming.

570
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,994
Anitha, In all the
newspapers, photos taken

571
00:42:17,015 --> 00:42:19,015
from the same angle
have been published.

572
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,036
The department does not
have photos I beleive.

573
00:42:21,057 --> 00:42:22,924
I am mailing a photo to you.

574
00:42:23,089 --> 00:42:25,983
Trace the person holding the
camera in it and call me.

575
00:42:26,004 --> 00:42:27,004
okay.

576
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:30,930
Hello, Manju!

577
00:42:31,951 --> 00:42:33,418
Sir, madam had called.

578
00:42:33,972 --> 00:42:35,972
In this pen drive there are
3 photos, do check sir.

579
00:42:35,993 --> 00:42:36,877
Only 3 photos!

580
00:42:36,898 --> 00:42:39,779
Yes, saying that there will be traffic
congestion, they cleared it soon.

581
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,096
They didn't allow us
to take photos, sir!

582
00:42:41,117 --> 00:42:42,650
It's okay.
- Fine sir!

583
00:42:42,838 --> 00:42:45,238
I will make a move, sir!
Thank you.

584
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,979
Drug smuggler kills
sub inspector.

585
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:42,884
Aye! don't switch
on the phone man!

586
00:43:42,905 --> 00:43:43,905
Give it to me!

587
00:43:44,726 --> 00:43:46,626
Ravi..
I will call the police.

588
00:43:46,647 --> 00:43:49,647
Aye! don't switch on the phone!
The police will trace my number.

589
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,668
Let them do!
I will surrender!

590
00:43:51,689 --> 00:43:52,989
What is wrong with you?

591
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:54,810
We are making one fault
after another, Gowri!

592
00:43:54,831 --> 00:43:57,431
If we are making fault to
live, it is not a fault man.

593
00:43:57,452 --> 00:43:59,452
Don't say many things
and confuse me!

594
00:43:59,473 --> 00:44:00,473
Look here!

595
00:44:00,494 --> 00:44:01,494
No need!

596
00:44:01,669 --> 00:44:04,659
It has come in the TV and news
papers.You have even stolen a car!

597
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,680
First call your mother
and leave for Bengaluru.

598
00:44:06,701 --> 00:44:08,384
I m not going anywhere
absconding you.

599
00:44:08,405 --> 00:44:10,205
I have withdrawn money
without informing my mother.

600
00:44:10,226 --> 00:44:11,359
It's a big fault.

601
00:44:11,468 --> 00:44:12,825
I have run away from home.

602
00:44:12,846 --> 00:44:15,446
I am really scared of my mother.
I won't call her at any cost

603
00:44:15,467 --> 00:44:17,249
That's why let us avoid
all these confusions.

604
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:18,403
I will surrender.

605
00:44:20,911 --> 00:44:23,311
Don’t Gowri. Let
me surrender man.

606
00:44:23,377 --> 00:44:25,077
We will do one thing.

607
00:44:25,126 --> 00:44:26,726
Here they have mentioned
an E-mail id.

608
00:44:26,738 --> 00:44:28,738
Let us E- mail them
and fix a place

609
00:44:28,807 --> 00:44:32,007
When the police come there, what
happened that day explain properly.

610
00:44:32,011 --> 00:44:34,011
If they agree, let
us go with them.

611
00:44:34,035 --> 00:44:35,535
And if they don’t?

612
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:39,059
If it is decided that we can survive
only if we commit mistakes, then let us!

613
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:42,070
Are you feeling that by falling in love
with me, you have done something wrong?

614
00:44:42,095 --> 00:44:44,095
I don’t know. -Your fate!

615
00:45:00,311 --> 00:45:01,811
Hello, where are you?

616
00:45:01,835 --> 00:45:03,035
I am in Udupi!

617
00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:04,434
Right! listen to me!

618
00:45:04,434 --> 00:45:07,634
A shoot-out investigation is on. The
person dead is a Sub Inspector.

619
00:45:07,687 --> 00:45:09,287
His left hand has two
missing fingers.

620
00:45:09,371 --> 00:45:10,771
Something is fishy.

621
00:45:10,815 --> 00:45:13,615
Because such peoples are not
appointed by our police department.

622
00:45:13,646 --> 00:45:15,546
I have checked all the records.

623
00:45:15,583 --> 00:45:18,583
He is an old rowdy sheeter called
coffee Appaiah, as I suspected.

624
00:45:19,011 --> 00:45:21,011
You could have enquired
in our department.

625
00:45:21,098 --> 00:45:22,798
Dude there are many
complications in this.

626
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:24,270
Just silently listen
to what I say.

627
00:45:24,275 --> 00:45:25,875
If he still in Coorg
town, call me please!

628
00:45:25,904 --> 00:45:28,104
After finishing the rituals,
I will go to Madikeri.

629
00:45:28,269 --> 00:45:30,669
Once I go there, I will check
and inform you, Purandar.

630
00:45:35,226 --> 00:45:37,226
Ravi!

631
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,580
Everything will become
all right, Ravi.

632
00:45:49,604 --> 00:45:51,504
Don’t cry please.

633
00:45:51,528 --> 00:45:53,528
If you cry, I too
feel like crying.

634
00:45:53,552 --> 00:45:56,152
What if tomorrow, the police
catch me and throw me the jail?

635
00:45:56,176 --> 00:45:59,376
If you are so much in doubt,
let us not mail them tomorrow.

636
00:46:03,213 --> 00:46:06,213
If they put me to jail for
15 years, what will you do?

637
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:09,601
I will also murder someone
and land in the jail.

638
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:11,625
Why? To manage a
house hold in jail?

639
00:46:11,649 --> 00:46:13,649
You are lying.

640
00:46:13,942 --> 00:46:16,442
You will marry the guy your
mother selects and live well.

641
00:46:16,466 --> 00:46:18,466
It is not like that Chinni.

642
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:21,290
Since you will be jail bird, no one will
give you their daughter for marriage.

643
00:46:21,314 --> 00:46:24,114
As I am a criminal, I too will
be rejected for marriage.

644
00:46:24,244 --> 00:46:26,744
Both of us are a criminal pair.
It will be fun.

645
00:46:28,824 --> 00:46:30,824
Chinni, I will sleep
right here itself.

646
00:46:48,683 --> 00:46:50,683
Ravi! I have mailed
the cops, man.

647
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:52,707
Right, switch off the phone.

648
00:46:52,728 --> 00:46:57,728
Walk me in your dreams
when it is sunny

649
00:46:58,139 --> 00:47:03,139
Serve me your love
when hunger strikes

650
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,000
Eclipse this world!

651
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,500
Embroider me in mirth

652
00:47:08,521 --> 00:47:11,521
If you are truly my beloved

653
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:17,290
My heart is a total pedestal

654
00:47:19,511 --> 00:47:23,511
In which you rule in all glory

655
00:47:24,832 --> 00:47:28,832
Walk me in your dreams
when it’s sunny

656
00:47:29,853 --> 00:47:33,853
Serve me your love
when hunger strikes

657
00:47:35,212 --> 00:47:40,212
Gowri here! Hi, can we meet at Gopalswamy
temple at 6 p.m. We are innocent-Thanks.

658
00:47:40,236 --> 00:47:42,836
Which Gopalswamy temple?

659
00:47:51,769 --> 00:47:55,769
Deliberately, simply
clashing with you

660
00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:00,790
In my eyes, on you
showed my affection.

661
00:48:01,711 --> 00:48:05,711
At times, I became mute
while chatting away

662
00:48:05,732 --> 00:48:09,732
I will embrace all
your pains with love

663
00:48:12,252 --> 00:48:15,252
Protect me if I go crazy

664
00:48:21,545 --> 00:48:26,045
In Tumkuru-Bengaluru road, Gopalswamy
temple! Where is it? Do check!

665
00:48:26,064 --> 00:48:28,564
Sir, near Dobaspete, there
is one such temple.

666
00:48:52,845 --> 00:48:54,845
Brother, what is the time?
- 5’o clock!

667
00:49:11,086 --> 00:49:13,586
We had told them to come by 6’o
clock, is it not? They are early!

668
00:49:13,654 --> 00:49:15,654
Yes, that’s so.
Come fast ! Gowri.

669
00:49:52,678 --> 00:49:54,478
Sir!

670
00:49:56,506 --> 00:49:58,106
Sir, we are here!

671
00:49:58,133 --> 00:50:00,133
Here! Here!

672
00:51:42,688 --> 00:51:44,688
What happened man!?

673
00:52:58,095 --> 00:53:00,595
Chinni, I will hurry and
get some cloths for you.

674
00:53:00,691 --> 00:53:02,891
You don’t go anywhere
Be right here.

675
00:53:58,845 --> 00:54:02,978
“Why have you born.. so much
hardship, I have been through..”

676
00:54:03,578 --> 00:54:05,978
“Why am I here.. to tell you toys..”

677
00:54:10,412 --> 00:54:13,745
“In this world, man has a
very short life span..”

678
00:54:15,077 --> 00:54:18,077
“without him, this earth
revolves as usual.”

679
00:54:18,598 --> 00:54:22,265
“We don’t have control over
the time, what can we do?”

680
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:26,559
“Let's hold the time with
us and play drama..”

681
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:29,757
“The toy player..”

682
00:54:30,957 --> 00:54:32,957
“Who is staring me all time..”

683
00:54:33,361 --> 00:54:35,628
“Why should I..
worry like you..”

684
00:54:42,303 --> 00:54:43,503
“The toy player..”

685
00:54:44,824 --> 00:54:46,824
“Who is staring me all time..”

686
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,384
“Why should I..
worry like you..”

687
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,020
I don’t want this.

688
00:55:44,022 --> 00:55:45,355
Ravi, what happened?

689
00:55:48,696 --> 00:55:49,696
It’s burning!

690
00:55:53,306 --> 00:55:54,439
Hey!Hey! Hey!Hey!

691
00:55:54,827 --> 00:55:55,827
Sorry!

692
00:56:11,656 --> 00:56:13,439
Koramangala Police station.

693
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:15,020
May I speak with ACP ? (Assistant
commissioner of police)

694
00:56:15,041 --> 00:56:17,041
He is here, Madam. I
will connect him.

695
00:56:17,062 --> 00:56:18,062
Hello! Tell me!

696
00:56:19,083 --> 00:56:20,083
Who is it?

697
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:22,190
I am Gowri Shetty.

698
00:56:22,211 --> 00:56:23,811
Are you the ACP talking?

699
00:56:24,032 --> 00:56:25,299
Yes! Purandar here!

700
00:56:25,453 --> 00:56:27,653
Are you a human?
This is insane!

701
00:56:27,974 --> 00:56:30,474
Saying you will meet us.
You shoot at us!

702
00:56:30,495 --> 00:56:32,028
Now listen to me Gowri!

703
00:56:32,198 --> 00:56:34,079
You misled me. No one
tuned up there!

704
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,084
Where are you now?

705
00:56:35,105 --> 00:56:36,038
Lies!

706
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,444
Yesterday you shoot at us!

707
00:56:37,465 --> 00:56:38,107
What!?

708
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:40,428
At the Chitradurga fort
didn’t you shoot at us!?

709
00:56:40,449 --> 00:56:41,649
Chitradurga Fort!?

710
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:43,452
There has been some
miscommunication.

711
00:56:43,473 --> 00:56:45,373
I was waiting elsewhere.
-What nonsense!

712
00:56:45,394 --> 00:56:47,494
Not knowing where we
were.You came to kill us!

713
00:56:47,515 --> 00:56:49,415
Listen! Like a cat, you’re
asking for the address!

714
00:56:49,436 --> 00:56:51,436
Are you listening? -Bunch
of losers you are!

715
00:56:51,457 --> 00:56:53,337
Now stop yelling!
- I will kill you!

716
00:56:53,358 --> 00:56:55,358
Tell me where you are!
--Yuck! You are all idiots.

717
00:56:55,379 --> 00:56:56,379
Where are you?

718
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,733
Was the call traced?

719
00:56:59,421 --> 00:57:01,421
What happened? The tower
signal was weak sir.

720
00:57:01,442 --> 00:57:02,975
Did it lock?
- No sir.

721
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:06,463
Hello!

722
00:57:06,584 --> 00:57:08,984
I am speaking from Purandar
sir’s office sir.

723
00:57:09,005 --> 00:57:12,439
Few minutes back, Shakunthala Shetty’s
daughter called our office saying

724
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:16,138
“Last evening near Chitradurga
Gopalswamy pond, why did you shoot us”?

725
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:17,538
She was scolding him sir.

726
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:20,389
But sir, Purandar sir didn’t
go to that place at all, sir!

727
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:21,410
What?
-Yes sir!

728
00:57:21,431 --> 00:57:23,031
Where did the call come from?

729
00:57:23,052 --> 00:57:24,752
It was traced to be
from Davanagere city.

730
00:57:24,773 --> 00:57:27,373
I will confirm you the exact
location after half an hour, sir!

731
00:57:27,394 --> 00:57:28,394
Right!

732
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:46,838
Greetings sir!

733
00:57:47,043 --> 00:57:48,376
Chandrashekar! -Sir!

734
00:57:48,891 --> 00:57:51,371
Yesterday, while the program was
going on near Gopalswamy pond

735
00:57:51,392 --> 00:57:52,574
Anything happened?

736
00:57:52,595 --> 00:57:54,219
Yes sir! A boy and
a girl saw us sir!

737
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,429
 What did you do? --We fired
around 3 rounds sir!

738
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:58,029
We searched for them all
night, but in vain, sir!

739
00:57:58,050 --> 00:57:59,087
Go and eat some mud!

740
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:00,808
Couldn’t you finish the
assigned task properly?

741
00:58:00,829 --> 00:58:02,703
Why didn’t you inform
me yesterday evening?

742
00:58:02,724 --> 00:58:04,493
I thought of finishing
the job and inform you.

743
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:06,087
Where are you now?
--Chitradurga city!

744
00:58:06,108 --> 00:58:07,708
Both of them are at
Davanagere city.

745
00:58:07,729 --> 00:58:10,229
This issue before it is leaked
to TV media and news paper

746
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:11,383
Close the matter.

747
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:12,704
Both of them, sir?

748
00:58:12,725 --> 00:58:14,725
Close the matter!
Close it, okay?

749
00:58:14,746 --> 00:58:15,813
Right sir, okay.

750
00:58:16,767 --> 00:58:17,834
What did he say?

751
00:58:18,788 --> 00:58:22,588
Aye, we have to finish both
that boy and girl, it seems!

752
00:58:46,891 --> 00:58:47,891
Who is this?

753
00:58:47,992 --> 00:58:48,772
Hello, Ravi!

754
00:58:48,793 --> 00:58:51,395
Did someone come and
knock on the door?-- No!

755
00:58:51,416 --> 00:58:53,616
Now listen. The
police are here!

756
00:58:53,637 --> 00:58:55,937
Don’t open the door,
if someone knocks.

757
00:58:55,958 --> 00:58:57,025
Right? Yes, yes.

758
00:59:07,675 --> 00:59:08,675
Suryakanth!

759
00:59:08,709 --> 00:59:10,709
Its 3 days since
Gowri left home.

760
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:11,909
I am really worried.

761
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:14,130
Why are you simply getting worried?
It will be ok.

762
00:59:14,151 --> 00:59:15,151
Where is she?

763
00:59:15,544 --> 00:59:17,844
As I told you earlier.
We are keeping track.

764
00:59:17,865 --> 00:59:21,365
Being concerned so much about my
daughter, have I taken it too far?

765
00:59:21,386 --> 00:59:22,586
Nothing like that.

766
00:59:23,207 --> 00:59:24,607
That boy is not good.

767
00:59:25,156 --> 00:59:26,889
He is a criminal you know?

768
00:59:27,177 --> 00:59:31,177
See your daughter will realize this and
she will leave him and come to you.

769
00:59:31,198 --> 00:59:32,931
Just wait and watch, okay?

770
01:00:08,253 --> 01:00:09,253
Tell me dude.

771
01:00:09,274 --> 01:00:10,546
I am on the way to Bengaluru.

772
01:00:10,567 --> 01:00:13,349
Hello! Stop the call. While driving
you are happily chatting.

773
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:14,294
Sorry madam.

774
01:00:14,315 --> 01:00:17,115
Dude I will call you later.
I am driving.

775
01:00:18,699 --> 01:00:21,048
What time will you
reach Bengaluru?

776
01:00:21,069 --> 01:00:23,069
It might take about
4.5 hours, madam.

777
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:25,157
Drive leisurely. --Right madam.

778
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:27,879
Is sir suffering from
chronic fever, madam?

779
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,900
Aye, stop the vehicle!
--Please don’t madam.

780
01:00:29,921 --> 01:00:30,921
Aye stop it!

781
01:00:31,942 --> 01:00:34,809
Aye, give the phone.
--Please don’t madam.

782
01:00:46,137 --> 01:00:48,329
It is only if you have this
gun, that you will steal cars.

783
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:49,399
Aye give it to me!

784
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:50,983
Will you just sleep Ravi!

785
01:00:51,004 --> 01:00:54,404
Before you open your eyes,
I will show you Mumbai.

786
01:01:12,662 --> 01:01:14,529
You are not well just sleep.

787
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:19,420
Sir, I showed Ravi’s photo.

788
01:01:19,924 --> 01:01:21,524
That lad too was right sir.

789
01:01:21,545 --> 01:01:23,145
Which way were they travelling?

790
01:01:23,166 --> 01:01:25,166
Sir, they have booked
the car for Bangaluru.

791
01:01:25,187 --> 01:01:26,787
Mostly they have headed there.

792
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:29,708
No it is all false. They are
simply confusing here.

793
01:01:29,729 --> 01:01:32,796
Check the toll both the ways.
-Sure, sir.Okay

794
01:01:32,933 --> 01:01:34,933
Mr.Venkatappa, write
a complaint.

795
01:01:34,954 --> 01:01:38,154
Please go and give the
vehicle number properly.

796
01:01:44,721 --> 01:01:45,988
What are you doing?

797
01:01:46,625 --> 01:01:49,195
See, I am changing the number plate.
--Why?

798
01:01:49,216 --> 01:01:51,516
Just like that, I
am thinking smart!

799
01:01:51,537 --> 01:01:53,337
Same just like your mother.

800
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:54,501
Cauvery Bar and Restaurant,
Coorg, Madikeri.

801
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:58,805
Purandar, the person you
asked for is right here.

802
01:02:58,826 --> 01:03:01,426
I will give it to him.
Take this, speak!

803
01:03:01,447 --> 01:03:03,247
Who is it? -- It’s ACP man.

804
01:03:03,468 --> 01:03:04,468
Tell me sir.

805
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:07,084
What’s happening Sub
Inspector GovindRaj?

806
01:03:07,105 --> 01:03:09,389
In Bengaluru they are conducting
rituals for your demise.

807
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:11,010
And in the Coorg town you are
drinking there happily!

808
01:03:11,031 --> 01:03:13,431
When you said Inspector
GovindRaj, I remembered.

809
01:03:13,452 --> 01:03:17,452
After the case, none in your department called
to inquire If I am breathing or not, sir!

810
01:03:17,473 --> 01:03:19,452
Please get me my
Rs.10, 000 Sir!

811
01:03:19,473 --> 01:03:23,805
In Inspector GovindRaj’s name, to stage this
dram, who was it who gave you this deal?

812
01:03:23,826 --> 01:03:25,526
Please don’t play
the fool, sir!

813
01:03:25,547 --> 01:03:28,280
Is it not your department
who called me?

814
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,604
I kept the gun on the
dashboard, the gun fell down.

815
01:03:30,628 --> 01:03:32,328
and the boy picked it up!

816
01:03:32,352 --> 01:03:34,352
I shot from another gun, sir!

817
01:03:34,376 --> 01:03:36,076
The boy got scared and ran away!

818
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:39,100
I put blood on my face and fell on
the steering, they took photos.

819
01:03:39,124 --> 01:03:40,724
Get dressed fast man!

820
01:03:40,732 --> 01:03:42,732
They took me in the ambulance
and left me half way.

821
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:43,940
Add something to it
and give me, sir!

822
01:03:44,005 --> 01:03:45,505
This is what they
have given.Go man!

823
01:03:45,529 --> 01:03:47,529
I asked for money, but
they refused, sir!

824
01:03:47,553 --> 01:03:48,853
You really don't know?

825
01:03:48,877 --> 01:03:50,877
I swear on my daughter,
I don't know sir!

826
01:03:50,901 --> 01:03:52,901
Atrocious!

827
01:03:52,925 --> 01:03:54,825
Who?

828
01:03:54,849 --> 01:03:56,349
Sub Inspector GovindRaj (SI)

829
01:03:56,373 --> 01:03:57,673
Is the dead man speaking?

830
01:03:57,697 --> 01:03:59,497
He is not dead, Ani!

831
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,700
SI GovindRaju's death was a drama
that was completely staged.

832
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:04,800
The photo that was published in the paper
is that of a local rowdy Coffe Appaiah!

833
01:04:04,824 --> 01:04:06,824
He is boozing in Coorg town.
I just spoke to him.

834
01:04:06,848 --> 01:04:09,148
If you trash him and take him to
task, he will open his mouth.

835
01:04:09,172 --> 01:04:11,172
Impossible, Ani. He
is a rowdy sheeter.

836
01:04:11,196 --> 01:04:14,696
In the entire deal, he will be
ignorant as to where he stands!

837
01:04:14,728 --> 01:04:17,228
Has something like this happened
in the department before?

838
01:04:17,252 --> 01:04:18,552
Quite a few!

839
01:04:18,557 --> 01:04:20,557
I feel that if you trace
the real SI GovindRaju

840
01:04:20,581 --> 01:04:24,081
perhaps you will get a solution
to all these problems.

841
01:04:41,801 --> 01:04:44,401
In Chitraduga Gopalswamy pond,
an unidentified dead body found.

842
01:04:45,032 --> 01:04:47,532
Puru, 2 days ago near
Chitradurga's Gopalswamy pond..

843
01:04:47,556 --> 01:04:50,156
..didn't you mention that the guy
and the girl were attacked?

844
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:51,980
They have found a dead
body near the pond.

845
01:04:52,004 --> 01:04:54,504
See, the news has been
published in the news paper.

846
01:05:20,582 --> 01:05:22,782
The bullet has entered the
body next to the neck.

847
01:05:22,826 --> 01:05:25,626
As the fish have eaten it away, the
face can't be identified properly.

848
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:27,450
There is a mark here!
-One second.

849
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:30,370
About SIGovindRaju, I got
few deatils about Inspector

850
01:05:30,394 --> 01:05:33,394
The Mangaluru drug raid, that had
happened.Do you remember it?

851
01:05:33,405 --> 01:05:37,405
After that, this SI GovindRaju has
reported to work for a mere 10-15 days.

852
01:05:37,429 --> 01:05:40,929
Even there, not a single day has
he correctly reported for duty.

853
01:05:43,201 --> 01:05:45,301
The most interesting
news is that recently

854
01:05:45,325 --> 01:05:48,825
there was news about the demise
of SI GovindRaju in Bengaluru

855
01:05:48,849 --> 01:05:52,549
Till then no one knew that such a
person exists in the department.

856
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:54,573
It's really strange , Ani!

857
01:05:55,454 --> 01:05:58,854
Puru, this Govindaraju's prominent
identification marks are

858
01:05:58,878 --> 01:06:01,878
There is a swelling mart
on his left hand forehand

859
01:06:01,902 --> 01:06:06,302
and on his right hand ha has
tattooed his mother's name.

860
01:06:06,366 --> 01:06:08,566
So it's confirmed, Ani.

861
01:06:08,638 --> 01:06:10,938
Who is dead here is the
real SI GovindRaju!

862
01:06:11,108 --> 01:06:13,408
I want few more details
about this GovindRaju!

863
01:06:13,432 --> 01:06:15,432
Just check and let me know!
-Ok!

864
01:06:15,456 --> 01:06:18,056
Department of Forensic medicine.

865
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,280
Mr.Swaminath!

866
01:06:19,304 --> 01:06:21,304
I am Purandar, the ACP speaking!

867
01:06:21,304 --> 01:06:22,104
Tell me sir!

868
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:24,440
There is a small case.I got to
know that you will co-operate.

869
01:06:24,485 --> 01:06:25,485
That's why I called you.

870
01:06:25,509 --> 01:06:26,809
What is it, tell me, sir!

871
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,900
A post mortem report
has to be faked now!

872
01:06:29,924 --> 01:06:31,924
Sir, what are you saying?

873
01:06:32,443 --> 01:06:33,843
I am not such a person, sir!

874
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:36,150
Who conducted the post mortem report
for SI GovindRaju? Is it not you?

875
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:36,970
Yes, sir!

876
01:06:37,063 --> 01:06:40,063
But SI GovindRaju's post mortem is
happening at Chitradurga city hospital!

877
01:06:40,087 --> 01:06:42,587
Which body did you conduct
post mortem report on?

878
01:06:42,611 --> 01:06:44,411
That is an inside matter!

879
01:06:44,435 --> 01:06:46,435
Let it be within ourselves, sir!

880
01:06:48,856 --> 01:06:50,856
Sindhu, I am ACP
Purandar speaking!

881
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,880
Sir, tell me!

882
01:07:11,354 --> 01:07:13,354
The money is melting over.

883
01:07:13,378 --> 01:07:15,678
I told you,but you
didn't listen to me.

884
01:07:15,702 --> 01:07:17,902
Will you keep quiet?

885
01:07:21,344 --> 01:07:23,544
Who are you calling?

886
01:07:25,871 --> 01:07:28,171
Aye, hi gowri, how are you?

887
01:07:28,246 --> 01:07:30,246
Leave all that aside. Listen!

888
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:31,870
Sindhu, I am in need
of urgent help.

889
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:33,914
I need some money.I
will return you back.

890
01:07:33,938 --> 01:07:35,738
You first listen!

891
01:07:35,762 --> 01:07:38,262
Some police inspector named
Purandar wants you to call him.

892
01:07:38,264 --> 01:07:40,264
He was saying that there
is something important!

893
01:07:40,288 --> 01:07:42,888
Please don't call any
friends, got it!

894
01:07:42,926 --> 01:07:44,926
Get lost!

895
01:07:44,950 --> 01:07:48,950
Are we serving the nation that
everyone has to jump and help us!

896
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:52,540
ACP Purandar, we have
to call, I believe.

897
01:07:52,564 --> 01:07:54,564
Do we really need to?

898
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:00,341
Hello!

899
01:08:00,365 --> 01:08:01,965
Kormangala police station.

900
01:08:01,989 --> 01:08:03,789
ACP Purandar sir is there? -May
I know who is on the line?

901
01:08:03,869 --> 01:08:05,869
I am Gowri shetty. I
wanted to talk to him.

902
01:08:05,893 --> 01:08:07,693
Sir is not in town.

903
01:08:07,717 --> 01:08:09,917
I will give you sir's mobile
number.Do write it down.

904
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,920
Ok sir, tell me sir! 9845..

905
01:08:13,905 --> 01:08:15,055
Give the phone to Ravi!

906
01:08:15,081 --> 01:08:16,781
When you have
decided to kill us.

907
01:08:16,785 --> 01:08:18,685
What difference does it make
as to who you are calling to.

908
01:08:18,690 --> 01:08:19,590
Talk to me, sir.

909
01:08:19,626 --> 01:08:22,826
See, without committing any crime, you
are running without any directions.

910
01:08:22,833 --> 01:08:25,133
I have to explain everything
in detail to you.

911
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:26,740
For that, you need to
meet me, understand that!

912
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:29,470
I don't believe you, sir!
Whatever it is, talk to me!

913
01:08:29,494 --> 01:08:31,494
You have to! Give
the phone to Ravi!

914
01:08:31,518 --> 01:08:32,218
Sorry, sir!

915
01:08:32,235 --> 01:08:34,335
I said give the phone to Ravi!

916
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:36,659
Sir!

917
01:08:36,995 --> 01:08:39,995
When you shot that day, did you
see the bullet being fired?

918
01:08:40,019 --> 01:08:43,019
Sir, that day in the panic, I
don't know what happened, sir.

919
01:08:43,043 --> 01:08:44,843
I heard the sound
of an explosion.

920
01:08:44,867 --> 01:08:47,667
I opened my eyes and he had
fallen on the steering, sir!

921
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:50,370
But that day the gun that was in
your hand did not fire the bullet.

922
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:52,380
This is because the person
is not dead, he is alive!

923
01:08:52,418 --> 01:08:55,418
Do you have the gun right with you?
-Yes sir! Open it!

924
01:08:55,442 --> 01:08:57,442
Do what I say! -Yes sir!
Tell me sir!

925
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:59,466
Open the magzine.
-How to open it, sir?

926
01:08:59,490 --> 01:09:01,490
There is a button
there.press it.

927
01:09:01,514 --> 01:09:03,514
It must be on the
other side, check !

928
01:09:05,111 --> 01:09:07,111
How many bullets are there?
--Six bullets.

929
01:09:07,115 --> 01:09:08,115
Exactly!

930
01:09:08,139 --> 01:09:10,739
In a fully loaded gun,there
should be 6 bullets only!

931
01:09:10,763 --> 01:09:13,763
By chance,if one was fired, there should
have been five, isn't it?--Yes sir!

932
01:09:13,787 --> 01:09:16,087
Then? You have not
killed anyone.

933
01:09:16,111 --> 01:09:19,211
I am killing you
is what you think!

934
01:09:19,235 --> 01:09:21,235
No! I will save you!

935
01:09:21,259 --> 01:09:25,259
You don't come anywhere!I will
come where you are and meet you.

936
01:09:25,283 --> 01:09:29,283
Please, you will have to believe
me!I will have to save you.

937
01:09:29,307 --> 01:09:31,307
Where are you now?

938
01:09:31,331 --> 01:09:33,731
Hubballi , sir!

939
01:09:33,755 --> 01:09:35,755
Ok, stay right there
and don't go anywhere.

940
01:09:35,779 --> 01:09:39,779
“Memory is a circadian Jasmine”

941
01:09:41,949 --> 01:09:45,949
“Dreams are like golden
jasmine flowers”

942
01:09:47,115 --> 01:09:51,115
“Such a beautiful punishment
for a small fault”

943
01:09:51,757 --> 01:09:55,757
“Impish play like
a coral jasmine”

944
01:09:55,778 --> 01:09:57,778
Hello!

945
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:02,010
Can you hear me?

946
01:10:02,528 --> 01:10:04,528
I am leaving to Hubballi now.

947
01:10:04,549 --> 01:10:07,549
Ravi & Gowri are meeting me at 6 p.m.
near chennamma circle.

948
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:12,570
Sir, Gowri & Ravi are meeting our officer
at 6.p.m. near hubballi chennamma circle.

949
01:10:12,591 --> 01:10:15,491
He had called his wife.

950
01:10:15,512 --> 01:10:17,512
Mr.Narayanswamy!

951
01:10:17,533 --> 01:10:20,233
See, I have got an information!

952
01:13:38,369 --> 01:13:41,569
If I get delayed getting back
then meet me near Unakallin kere.

953
01:13:47,215 --> 01:13:52,115
On slippery lanes, it
looks like it has ended.

954
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:56,136
Glancing back, there
lies a border.

955
01:13:56,157 --> 01:14:01,157
If I turn and run ahead,
there lies a border.

956
01:14:01,178 --> 01:14:07,178
The anklets are such that
they have knotted the earth.

957
01:14:07,193 --> 01:14:12,193
Does it matter as to where
we go or where we come.

958
01:14:12,214 --> 01:14:18,214
Does it matter as to where
we sit or where we stand.

959
01:14:23,062 --> 01:14:24,162
Sir, tell me!

960
01:14:24,164 --> 01:14:25,564
Why have not you
called till now?

961
01:14:25,566 --> 01:14:26,666
Sir, we are still searching!

962
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:28,087
You're an idiot, I say!

963
01:14:28,108 --> 01:14:30,108
Yes sir! He escaped in a
fraction of a second!

964
01:14:30,129 --> 01:14:33,029
It is because of dumb asses like you
that our department is like this!

965
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:34,435
Oh, it's burning like mad!

966
01:14:34,456 --> 01:14:36,156
You, you I will transfer you!

967
01:14:36,177 --> 01:14:38,177
Sir!

968
01:14:42,351 --> 01:14:44,351
Come here I say!
Tell me, sir!

969
01:14:44,372 --> 01:14:46,072
How much is this?

970
01:14:46,093 --> 01:14:47,093
Rs.30,000, sir!

971
01:14:48,001 --> 01:14:52,001
Right.About the Mangaluru drug
deal, I have got some information.

972
01:14:52,022 --> 01:14:55,075
8 months ago,an infomation was
received from Karwara town

973
01:14:55,097 --> 01:14:58,043
about a drug deal case which
was running in a big scale.

974
01:14:58,064 --> 01:15:00,064
3 police officers
teamed up and raid it.

975
01:15:00,085 --> 01:15:02,485
About 100 millions worth
of drugs are siezed and..

976
01:15:02,505 --> 01:15:05,005
..this information was given
by them to the government.

977
01:15:05,026 --> 01:15:09,026
After this in a few days
sub inspector GovindRaju..

978
01:15:09,047 --> 01:15:12,047
..goes missing suddenly
from the team.

979
01:15:12,177 --> 01:15:15,177
Then asking for a transfer, he
himself begets the tranfer

980
01:15:15,198 --> 01:15:17,198
..without the order
of the government.

981
01:15:17,219 --> 01:15:18,519
Seeing all this..

982
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:20,040
the account given
to the government..

983
01:15:20,061 --> 01:15:22,861
..something worth more than
that in tune of many millions.

984
01:15:22,882 --> 01:15:25,082
..has been gulped
is what I feel.

985
01:15:25,130 --> 01:15:27,130
When the officers were
sharing the ammount equally,

986
01:15:27,135 --> 01:15:28,935
Something has gone amiss, PURU!

987
01:15:28,956 --> 01:15:31,956
This SIGovindRaju has not paid
up and has gone in to hiding.

988
01:15:31,977 --> 01:15:34,277
Later he must have been
caught in Chitradurga city.

989
01:15:34,298 --> 01:15:36,598
By chance if he is apprehended
and opens his mouth

990
01:15:36,619 --> 01:15:39,019
..then all the three
will get jacked.

991
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:43,040
So they all have joined and
killed him, thats what I feel.

992
01:15:43,061 --> 01:15:44,861
Who all were there in the team?

993
01:15:44,882 --> 01:15:46,882
Chandrashekar, Narayanswamy
and GovindRaj.

994
01:15:46,903 --> 01:15:48,903
and..

995
01:15:48,924 --> 01:15:51,924
..the area incharge was deputy
commissioner Suryakanth

996
01:15:51,945 --> 01:15:53,945
Ok, Ani, I will call
you again later.

997
01:15:55,854 --> 01:15:58,254
They are travelling in the high
way in the same direction.

998
01:15:58,359 --> 01:16:00,259
We were supposed to meet
them up in Hubballi.

999
01:16:00,296 --> 01:16:02,396
I waited but they
didn't turn up!

1000
01:16:02,432 --> 01:16:04,832
If they have the intention to mislead,
they would have gone to the next town.

1001
01:16:04,853 --> 01:16:06,653
I will go to Belagavi and check!

1002
01:16:06,674 --> 01:16:08,674
If you get any clue
here, inform me.

1003
01:16:19,295 --> 01:16:22,295
See Chandrashekar, you
go straight to Belagavi.

1004
01:16:22,316 --> 01:16:23,416
Ok, sir!

1005
01:16:23,626 --> 01:16:26,126
You have to be closely trail,
officer Purandar.--ok, sir.

1006
01:16:26,223 --> 01:16:30,023
You have to finish that boy and the
girl before they meet Purandar

1007
01:16:30,030 --> 01:16:30,930
Okay, sir!

1008
01:16:30,951 --> 01:16:33,951
See I am warning you.This is
your last time.--yes sir.

1009
01:16:33,972 --> 01:16:37,972
This time too, if you say such a strory
that you are unable to catch them,

1010
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:40,993
..then you will not be able
to leave Belagavi city.

1011
01:16:40,995 --> 01:16:41,995
Okay, sir!

1012
01:16:52,158 --> 01:16:54,658
I will go,change my
dress and return.

1013
01:17:11,375 --> 01:17:12,575
Hello!

1014
01:17:12,667 --> 01:17:14,467
Mother!

1015
01:17:14,488 --> 01:17:16,488
Gowri! please talk to me!

1016
01:17:16,509 --> 01:17:18,509
Where are you,Gowri?

1017
01:17:18,530 --> 01:17:20,930
Why didn't you contact
me all these days?

1018
01:17:20,951 --> 01:17:22,951
Mother!

1019
01:17:25,127 --> 01:17:27,127
I am scared of you ma!

1020
01:17:27,148 --> 01:17:29,148
Why are you scared?

1021
01:17:29,169 --> 01:17:31,169
I don't know, ma!

1022
01:17:31,190 --> 01:17:33,190
I feel scared!

1023
01:17:34,707 --> 01:17:36,707
Ma, do you remember?

1024
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:39,680
Once because I came
late from school,

1025
01:17:39,743 --> 01:17:42,243
the whole night you let
me be outside the door.

1026
01:17:42,264 --> 01:17:49,764
I called you many times Mama! Mama! many
times but you didn't open the door!

1027
01:17:49,785 --> 01:17:55,785
When I remember your anger
even now, I get scared Ma!

1028
01:18:00,689 --> 01:18:02,689
Gowri!No!

1029
01:18:02,710 --> 01:18:05,310
If you want to return
come back alone!

1030
01:18:05,331 --> 01:18:07,331
I really love him a lot ma!

1031
01:18:07,352 --> 01:18:09,352
Mama!

1032
01:18:10,345 --> 01:18:12,345
Please ma!

1033
01:18:18,766 --> 01:18:20,566
Gowri!

1034
01:18:20,587 --> 01:18:23,587
What happened? Why
are you crying?

1035
01:18:27,106 --> 01:18:29,106
What happened man?

1036
01:18:29,127 --> 01:18:31,127
My last hope was my Mama!

1037
01:18:31,148 --> 01:18:33,648
She herself told me
not to come home!

1038
01:18:33,669 --> 01:18:36,669
Don't cry, Gowri, nothing
will happen, be calm!

1039
01:19:40,581 --> 01:19:43,081
Why are you behaving
is such a rude way?

1040
01:19:43,102 --> 01:19:46,502
Is it because you think everything
is happening because of me!

1041
01:19:46,523 --> 01:19:48,223
Be honest and tell me!

1042
01:19:48,244 --> 01:19:51,244
Are you scared to take
my responsibility?

1043
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:55,520
Answer me.
 I am asking you.

1044
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:57,841
Be quite Gowri! My
head is splitting!

1045
01:19:57,862 --> 01:19:59,862
This..this is not the
answer to my question!

1046
01:20:03,049 --> 01:20:05,549
You are so selfish!

1047
01:20:05,558 --> 01:20:07,558
And I believed you and came!

1048
01:20:07,579 --> 01:20:11,579
When my mama ditched us, I
thought you would console me.

1049
01:20:12,327 --> 01:20:16,427
I don't have anyone man! I feel
I have committed a blunder!

1050
01:20:18,667 --> 01:20:20,667
Don't cry Gowri!

1051
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:23,810
Then answer me!

1052
01:20:23,836 --> 01:20:25,736
Let us stay together.
-Lies!!

1053
01:20:25,757 --> 01:20:27,557
You're not saying
this from your heart!

1054
01:20:27,578 --> 01:20:29,778
Aye, that day you asked me
repeatedly to leave, Ravi!

1055
01:20:29,799 --> 01:20:32,299
I will go now, but I
will not go home.

1056
01:20:32,697 --> 01:20:34,297
I will go somewhere else!

1057
01:20:34,364 --> 01:20:37,064
I won't die. I will live and
how you.--Aiyyo Gowri sorry!

1058
01:20:37,085 --> 01:20:39,585
Please understand.I didn't
mean that!--Leave me!!

1059
01:22:31,606 --> 01:22:33,606
Ravi!

1060
01:22:59,836 --> 01:23:02,436
Why you are so dull?

1061
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,500
Last night did I say
something and sudden you?

1062
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:07,121
In the early morning, I
had a bad dream, Ravi!

1063
01:23:07,817 --> 01:23:11,017
The police shot you and
my mother dragged me!

1064
01:23:11,038 --> 01:23:13,038
In that chitradurga peak,

1065
01:23:13,059 --> 01:23:16,059
police who were searching
with a torch you know?

1066
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:19,080
I coudn't remember
properly what was it?

1067
01:23:19,101 --> 01:23:22,601
People says, the dreams that you
have in the morning will come true!

1068
01:23:23,082 --> 01:23:25,082
We both will die!

1069
01:23:26,103 --> 01:23:29,403
As far as I remember, we
haven't harmed anyone, Ravi!

1070
01:23:30,439 --> 01:23:33,239
This life is what
you have saved man!

1071
01:23:33,314 --> 01:23:35,914
My breath is a gift
that you have given.

1072
01:23:35,916 --> 01:23:38,916
Why is that everyone
wants to kill us!?

1073
01:23:39,811 --> 01:23:42,711
Gowri, we are almost
reaching Belagavi.

1074
01:23:42,716 --> 01:23:44,716
Just ahead is Mumbai!

1075
01:23:44,737 --> 01:23:46,737
New city, new life
and new people!

1076
01:23:46,758 --> 01:23:49,158
Don't worry, we
can somehow live.

1077
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:51,990
We are dying without money!

1078
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:56,112
Who is waiting to help us?

1079
01:23:58,379 --> 01:24:00,379
Hey, shall we sell this bangle?

1080
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,400
This is your love gift!

1081
01:24:02,421 --> 01:24:04,821
To hell with the love!

1082
01:24:04,952 --> 01:24:07,452
If we sell this bangle, we will
get a flight ticket to Mumbai!

1083
01:24:07,473 --> 01:24:09,973
You are really super!

1084
01:24:10,814 --> 01:24:12,814
Oh! it smells!

1085
01:24:12,822 --> 01:24:14,022
First change this shirt!

1086
01:24:14,109 --> 01:24:17,009
You fell in the ditch and
hugged me and wept like a baby!

1087
01:24:17,110 --> 01:24:19,110
It's you who is smelly!

1088
01:24:37,550 --> 01:24:39,550
We don't want this.Let us go!

1089
01:24:42,121 --> 01:24:46,121
In between cities,
tar was put by whom?

1090
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:55,180
Who fixed milestone stand
proclaimed that this was a city?

1091
01:24:58,638 --> 01:25:03,538
Whose guiding finger did
we believe and come?

1092
01:25:03,559 --> 01:25:08,559
We, our own shadow have
killed a long ago.

1093
01:25:09,109 --> 01:25:14,109
When every life's journey
only ends in the mud!

1094
01:25:14,130 --> 01:25:19,130
What if there is life?
What if there isn't?

1095
01:25:19,343 --> 01:25:25,343
What then is the way? What
then is the direction?

1096
01:25:27,225 --> 01:25:32,225
On slippery lanes, it
looks like it has ended.

1097
01:25:32,246 --> 01:25:37,246
Glancing back, there
lies a border.

1098
01:25:37,267 --> 01:25:42,267
If I turn and run ahead,
there lies a border.

1099
01:25:44,478 --> 01:25:48,478
If you have to help us, should
we tell you our entire story?

1100
01:25:48,537 --> 01:25:50,637
Without a clue,wide eyed
on the road,while you were..

1101
01:25:50,650 --> 01:25:52,850
..standing as if you
have lost something.

1102
01:25:52,871 --> 01:25:54,971
I realized then that
you are love birds.

1103
01:25:54,990 --> 01:25:56,990
Have you escaped from home?

1104
01:25:57,011 --> 01:26:02,011
See! all that we have is this
bangle and the phone and then..

1105
01:26:02,284 --> 01:26:04,384
That's all sir! Nothing else!

1106
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:06,651
You have to escape to
Mumbai from here!--Yes!

1107
01:26:07,129 --> 01:26:10,129
Firstly, I get a room for
both of you with my money.

1108
01:26:10,130 --> 01:26:12,130
Freshen up!

1109
01:26:12,151 --> 01:26:15,651
I will get this bangle sold
in front of your eyes!

1110
01:26:18,071 --> 01:26:20,071
Rs.30,000 here!

1111
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:22,992
How much do you need in this?

1112
01:26:23,015 --> 01:26:25,015
For me? Give.

1113
01:26:26,986 --> 01:26:28,986
This is for the ticket!

1114
01:26:29,007 --> 01:26:31,007
This is for the identification!

1115
01:26:31,028 --> 01:26:33,028
This is for the
lunch and dinner.

1116
01:26:33,049 --> 01:26:34,749
Aye! Police!!

1117
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:36,752
This one! where?

1118
01:27:07,773 --> 01:27:09,173
Hello!

1119
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:10,800
Gowri, What are you
all playing with me?

1120
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:12,820
You have already
helped us a lot, sir!

1121
01:27:12,825 --> 01:27:14,825
Before we take any
bad decisions..

1122
01:27:14,830 --> 01:27:16,630
Please just leave us alone!

1123
01:27:16,635 --> 01:27:18,735
Last evening, at hubballi
circle, you promised to meet.

1124
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:20,540
Where are you now?--We
don't need this crap!

1125
01:27:20,542 --> 01:27:22,842
Believing you, we’ve already
committed a huge mistake!

1126
01:27:23,018 --> 01:27:25,318
Again and again your department
people are following us,

1127
01:27:25,332 --> 01:27:26,932
I am not the kind to keep quiet.

1128
01:27:26,939 --> 01:27:29,239
I will expose you in the
social media.

1129
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:30,460
Who is talking?

1130
01:27:30,466 --> 01:27:32,366
No..who is following you?
Listen to me!

1131
01:27:32,387 --> 01:27:34,187
I will promise nobody
will follow you.

1132
01:27:34,208 --> 01:27:36,208
I really don't care about you.

1133
01:27:36,529 --> 01:27:38,829
Please stop following
us over and again!

1134
01:27:38,914 --> 01:27:41,814
I know your network. I
know where all you are.

1135
01:27:41,828 --> 01:27:43,428
I,I just have a
last option left!

1136
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:45,430
I am writing a suicide letter.I
will add your name in that.

1137
01:27:45,514 --> 01:27:46,514
and die that's all!

1138
01:27:46,523 --> 01:27:48,323
Gowri!listen! Don't take..

1139
01:27:48,344 --> 01:27:51,144
I will destroy your life.
--Right here, RAMDEV hotel.

1140
01:27:51,189 --> 01:27:55,189
Right here, Ramdev hotel, come fast!
Room no.309!

1141
01:28:02,890 --> 01:28:04,890
Right here, Ramdev hotel, come fast!
Room no.309!

1142
01:28:24,596 --> 01:28:26,396
I will shoot you, leave him.

1143
01:28:26,419 --> 01:28:28,419
Shoot!

1144
01:28:28,463 --> 01:28:30,463
Don't shoot ,Gowri!

1145
01:28:30,465 --> 01:28:32,265
If you know how to
shoot properly,

1146
01:28:32,266 --> 01:28:34,666
by now 3 corpses
would have fallen!

1147
01:29:47,122 --> 01:29:50,622
Near Gopalswamy pond
some 2 policemen

1148
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:53,580
you called them and without
even talking to you..

1149
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:55,580
they shot you. All
this you have written.

1150
01:29:55,601 --> 01:29:56,801
Yes, sir!

1151
01:29:56,806 --> 01:29:59,706
Can you identify who they are?

1152
01:29:59,886 --> 01:30:01,886
We mailed Purandar, sir!

1153
01:30:01,907 --> 01:30:03,907
He may have been one of them

1154
01:30:03,928 --> 01:30:05,228
The other, I didn't know.

1155
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:06,660
Saying may have been..

1156
01:30:06,660 --> 01:30:08,560
..in doubt here is not possible!

1157
01:30:08,581 --> 01:30:10,481
This is a matter
of life or death!

1158
01:30:10,502 --> 01:30:12,502
We were near the temple!

1159
01:30:12,523 --> 01:30:14,523
They were far away at the pond!

1160
01:30:14,544 --> 01:30:16,944
I couldn't identify them.

1161
01:30:20,568 --> 01:30:21,768
Right!

1162
01:30:21,789 --> 01:30:25,789
Put a signature on this
paper with today's date.

1163
01:30:27,810 --> 01:30:29,010
Tell me, sir!

1164
01:30:29,031 --> 01:30:33,031
See, that girl has given
a signed statement!

1165
01:30:33,209 --> 01:30:36,209
Stating that she hasn't seen
anything at Gopalswamy pond.

1166
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:38,630
Tell this to Narayana Swamy also.
--Okay, sir!

1167
01:30:38,651 --> 01:30:40,451
Purandar!

1168
01:30:40,472 --> 01:30:43,372
now missing, kidnapping have
all been laid to rest.

1169
01:30:43,393 --> 01:30:46,393
Now it is a case of
encounter death!

1170
01:30:46,414 --> 01:30:49,114
There will be an
enquiry against you!

1171
01:30:49,135 --> 01:30:50,735
I will help you!

1172
01:30:50,756 --> 01:30:52,356
Take Gowri's statement .

1173
01:30:52,371 --> 01:30:54,371
File a report accordingly!

1174
01:30:54,392 --> 01:30:55,692
There is no accused in this case.

1175
01:30:55,733 --> 01:30:57,733
There are accused
remaining, sir.

1176
01:30:57,813 --> 01:30:59,813
That boy died for no reason!

1177
01:30:59,834 --> 01:31:02,834
The reason for his death is
known both to you and to me.

1178
01:31:02,855 --> 01:31:06,855
In the enquiry, I will report
completely whatever happened, sir.

1179
01:31:09,207 --> 01:31:10,707
Ravi is a poor boy!

1180
01:31:10,787 --> 01:31:13,787
If you encounter him,no one will
ask.Is this why you killed him!

1181
01:31:13,808 --> 01:31:17,708
For having saved her daughter, her
mother might have thanked you, isn't it?

1182
01:31:17,729 --> 01:31:20,729
The police behave in a way that
makes the public scold them, PURU!

1183
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:22,750
What you did is not right!

1184
01:31:22,771 --> 01:31:24,571
Why are you smiling?

1185
01:31:24,592 --> 01:31:28,092
Is it because you think you
have achieved something great?

1186
01:31:28,113 --> 01:31:29,813
All this is happened
because of you!

1187
01:31:29,834 --> 01:31:31,034
Because of me?--yes!

1188
01:31:31,048 --> 01:31:32,648
How is that?

1189
01:31:32,669 --> 01:31:35,669
Is it not you, who told me
about the Mangaluru drug deal?

1190
01:31:35,690 --> 01:31:39,690
In Belagawi, when I saw
Naryanswamy & Chandrashekar,

1191
01:31:39,728 --> 01:31:41,728
I weighted everything once!

1192
01:31:41,730 --> 01:31:43,730
On thing I got confirmed.

1193
01:31:43,742 --> 01:31:46,142
Both Gowri and
Ravindra will die!

1194
01:31:46,163 --> 01:31:48,363
I don't know whose
good fortune it was!

1195
01:31:48,430 --> 01:31:49,830
Gowri called me.

1196
01:31:49,844 --> 01:31:52,044
I was able to detect the
hotel they were staying in.

1197
01:31:52,065 --> 01:31:54,065
It was me who barged in first!

1198
01:31:56,940 --> 01:31:58,940
Sir!

1199
01:32:00,165 --> 01:32:02,165
Why are you looking at my face?

1200
01:32:02,365 --> 01:32:04,265
Did you know who gave this deal?

1201
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:05,270
Gowri's mother!

1202
01:32:05,296 --> 01:32:08,496
If the police had not got the deal,
some rowdies would have killed you!

1203
01:32:08,498 --> 01:32:11,198
Do you have any idea as to what kind
of cases is piled up in your name?

1204
01:32:11,219 --> 01:32:13,219
Drug, murder, kidnapping!

1205
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:15,340
None of these are
connected to you!

1206
01:32:15,341 --> 01:32:16,741
You are being falsely
linked to all these.

1207
01:32:16,742 --> 01:32:18,742
Even now if you go
out, you will be dead!

1208
01:32:18,763 --> 01:32:21,863
Sir, she is my life!
I really love her.

1209
01:32:21,926 --> 01:32:23,926
Aye, That's what I
am harping you!

1210
01:32:24,077 --> 01:32:26,277
It's only when you have a
life that you can love.

1211
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:27,380
Go and save your life first!

1212
01:32:27,469 --> 01:32:29,969
Shut your trap and leave her!
You both have to seperate!

1213
01:32:30,084 --> 01:32:31,984
Gowri will die if I
am not with her, sir!

1214
01:32:32,028 --> 01:32:33,328
Earlier you were
the only target.

1215
01:32:33,330 --> 01:32:35,330
Now she too be the target.Now
they will finish both of you.

1216
01:32:35,347 --> 01:32:36,447
Is that what you want?

1217
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:38,520
Nothing bad should
happen to my Gowri, sir!

1218
01:32:38,690 --> 01:32:40,990
See, I will promise you.
Nothing will happen.

1219
01:32:41,647 --> 01:32:43,647
Act like I tell you
and you will suvive.

1220
01:32:43,650 --> 01:32:45,650
What do you say?

1221
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:47,080
I will do it, sir!

1222
01:32:47,141 --> 01:32:48,841
Tell me, sir!

1223
01:32:48,862 --> 01:32:50,862
Prepare a post mortem report!

1224
01:32:50,883 --> 01:32:52,883
The name is Ravindra.

1225
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:58,280
Are you planning to inform
Gowri that Ravi is alive!

1226
01:32:58,301 --> 01:33:00,301
I don't know!

1227
01:33:04,208 --> 01:33:06,208
MUMBAI

1228
01:33:06,229 --> 01:33:11,229
Don't forget to forgive me,
if you do remember me.

1229
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:14,250
Light up your dreams.

1230
01:33:14,271 --> 01:33:17,271
..if darkness engulfs you.

1231
01:33:17,509 --> 01:33:20,509
Only you well being..

1232
01:33:20,530 --> 01:33:23,530
I cause for my love..

1233
01:33:23,551 --> 01:33:28,551
From you, far away,
I will run away!

1234
01:33:41,506 --> 01:33:45,506
This mind of memories,
it is an edition.

1235
01:33:45,527 --> 01:33:50,527
The pages to turn, I hesitate.

1236
01:33:50,548 --> 01:33:56,548
Don't forget to forgive
me,if you do remember me.

1237
01:33:56,569 --> 01:33:59,569
Light up your dreams.

1238
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:01,990
if darkness engulfs you.

1239
01:34:02,056 --> 01:34:06,056
Aye when I asleep, if you
desrt me, sure I will die.

1240
01:34:09,162 --> 01:34:11,162
Are you feeling that by
falling in love with me

1241
01:34:11,229 --> 01:34:14,229
you have done something
wrong?--I don't know!

1242
01:34:14,795 --> 01:34:17,795
Are you scared to take
my responsibility?

1243
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:21,840
Hey, wait, let us die together.

1244
01:34:30,497 --> 01:34:35,497
Unseen in any other
place,this concentration.

1245
01:34:36,095 --> 01:34:41,095
By seeing it only,
did it happen thus?

1246
01:34:41,644 --> 01:34:46,244
Did it slip from my hands,
this story of mine!

1247
01:34:46,248 --> 01:34:52,248
If not today, later to join you.This
longing will keep me alive!

1248
01:34:52,248 --> 01:34:55,048
When I get you, all
this I will narrate.

1249
01:34:55,069 --> 01:34:58,669
I like this alliance if Chetan is
going to become my son-in law.

1250
01:34:58,690 --> 01:35:02,690
This mind is a limitless ocean.

1251
01:35:02,711 --> 01:35:06,711
At night they are wakeful waves.

1252
01:35:09,329 --> 01:35:11,329
Hi Gowri!

1253
01:35:20,524 --> 01:35:21,924
Hello Gowri!

1254
01:35:21,950 --> 01:35:22,950
Gowri, it's me!

1255
01:35:23,010 --> 01:35:25,010
Who is it? Gowri, It's me Ravi!

1256
01:35:25,031 --> 01:35:26,831
Ravi!

1257
01:35:26,845 --> 01:35:28,845
How are you?

1258
01:35:41,419 --> 01:35:44,419
The cool breeze has
brought in your voice.

1259
01:35:47,687 --> 01:35:51,587
In my eyes are drying
the small tear drops.

1260
01:35:51,927 --> 01:35:56,927
In me, as a smile,you
are standing.

1261
01:35:57,332 --> 01:36:02,332
Without blinking eyes, only your
arrival will eagerly await for

1262
01:36:02,353 --> 01:36:06,353
You...I will see at any cost.

1263
01:36:08,325 --> 01:36:12,325
This mind has enacted this drama.

1264
01:36:13,821 --> 01:36:18,821
In life stirring intrigue.

1265
01:36:24,342 --> 01:36:27,342
Hey, Chandrashekar,
What has happened?

1266
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:36,140
