1
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,291
My grandfather brought me
to the riverbank for the first time.

2
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:09,291
That day, it suddenly
became dark even during the day!

3
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:14,708
A small moon eclipsed
such a big Sun!

4
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:18,791
The sun wins every day.

5
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,583
But the moon too has its day!

6
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:29,166
Excuse me, Ma’am.

7
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:30,708
What was the reason,

8
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:34,583
you fought this battle against
norms of religion, society and tradition?

9
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:38,000
No religion teaches us discrimination.

10
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:41,541
Anyway, I was not
fighting against anybody.

11
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,791
In fact, I was
fighting for someone’s rights.

12
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:46,250
Nobody can deny anyone's rights.

13
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:50,375
Last year, you won a battle for the rights
of transgenders and street children.

14
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,958
And now, for the widows.

15
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:54,125
Do you think India is changing?

16
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:56,875
This is just the beginning.
There is a long battle ahead of us.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,500
That was Senior Advocate of Supreme Court
- Noor Saxena.

18
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,875
Holi celebrations will be
different this year

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,625
since an ancient tradition
will be discontinued.

20
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,083
Tomorrow, for the first time,

21
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,249
the widows of Vrindavan
and Banaras will play Holi.

22
00:02:10,374 --> 00:02:13,291
The people involved
in this historic win include

23
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:20,000
Advocate Noor Saxena, Amit Tripathi
and Bindu Khanna.

24
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:25,333
It’s a very big day, not just for the law,
but for equality and freedom

25
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:28,416
and most importantly for the new India.

26
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,375
They call you an untouchable, right?

27
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,541
You rise so high,

28
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:44,541
scale such heights that
these people cannot even touch you!

29
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,875
I’m finally going home after 24 years
to fulfill a promise.

30
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:09,875
It’s the same city which gave
me everything and then took it all away.

31
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,916
I hope that Mother Ganga
will recognize her daughter.

32
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:22,416
Would Chintu and the lanes of Banaras
also be waiting for me?

33
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:43,666
Chhoti, I will never let you fall.

34
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,500
No, no, whatever you say,

35
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,458
this Holi, I will splash color on you.

36
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,250
This is my promise to you.

37
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,583
No Chhoti, I am forbidden
to play with colors now.

38
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,708
Everyone left me one by one.

39
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,833
I will never leave you alone.

40
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,041
Liar!

41
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,499
I swear by the River Ganga.

42
00:04:19,624 --> 00:04:20,749
We will see!

43
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:32,916
Chhoti...

44
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,458
Ma’am!
Hope you had a safe journey.

45
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,250
Ma’am, everything is arranged.

46
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,625
The Holi colors and flowers are here.

47
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,958
I was awake all night!

48
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,208
It’s such a big occasion,
just because of you.

49
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,875
We are so proud of you, Ma’am.

50
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:29,041
I have ordered
new sarees for all of them.

51
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,041
The room upstairs is ready.

52
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,250
Just...

53
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,791
Just a small problem now.

54
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,458
The local people are
creating a lot of commotion.

55
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:41,583
They are complaining to the police
that the widows can’t play Holi.

56
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,166
-Hmm.
-We have the legal documents.

57
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,458
But we are finding it difficult
to handle the situation.

58
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,875
They are raising sensitive issues.

59
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,500
There is no security for us.

60
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,208
Even the cops are supporting them.

61
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:36,958
Ma’am…

62
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,500
Ma’am, is everything okay?

63
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,125
Excuse me, Ma’am?

64
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:54,083
My Chhoti, My Moon

65
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,958
Chhoti. Chhoti.

66
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,750
Look, I got this pigeon for you.

67
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,958
Did you buy it with
the gambling money?

68
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,250
No, I caught it at the riverbank.

69
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,791
Liar! You have again lost all
the money in gambling.

70
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,416
Now all the children
will go to school except me.

71
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,208
You were making tall promises.

72
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,750
What happened now?
Broke all your promises?

73
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,875
I gulped the chewing gum
also because of you!

74
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,125
Keep your pigeon with you.

75
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,291
Chhoti, sorry.

76
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,833
Chintu, only four months
are left for the festival of Holi.

77
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,416
Then schools will reopen.

78
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,833
If we don’t pay
300 rupees to the school,

79
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,833
I won’t get admission yet again.

80
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,666
We will work hard,
sell flowers and walk on the rope.

81
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,291
We will earn the money somehow.

82
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:04,291
Just stay away from the police
and that slimy shopkeeper.

83
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,583
Don’t fall into their trap again.

84
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,291
-People, bet some money.
-Go ahead.

85
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,541
Miser!

86
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,791
Chhoti, walk fast!

87
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,166
Come on, walk.

88
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,000
Chhoti, got two rupees!

89
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,958
Come on, brother, bet some money.

90
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,791
Should we pay you for
the same show every day?

91
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,000
But you have won many times.

92
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,875
This time, tell her
to walk without the stick.

93
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,125
Only then will I bet.

94
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,083
Chhoti, walk without the stick!

95
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,791
And what if I fall?

96
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,250
My bones will break,
what will you lose?

97
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,333
My life!

98
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,375
Look, here they are.
Again, they have put up their show.

99
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,041
Chintu, run… Police!

100
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,166
Catch them!

101
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,833
They don’t change
despite getting beaten up.

102
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,791
-Get lost from here!
- Run!

103
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,083
Get lost from here.

104
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,333
They do business and we get scolded.

105
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,333
They put up a show here
like they own the place.

106
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,375
Stop!
Where are you going?

107
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,458
Stop!
Damn you!

108
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,041
I won't spare you today.

109
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,583
Stop!

110
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,208
Get them!

111
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,041
Stop!

112
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,250
Stop!

113
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,833
Stop!

114
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,333
Hey...

115
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:03,833
Chintu...

116
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,291
Chintu! Chintu!

117
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,083
Stop, you dog!

118
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,833
I work hard to earn money
and he enjoys it.

119
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,458
You dog!

120
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:21,041
Let me wash my feet,
then I will handle you.

121
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,041
Bloody dog, rascal!
He ran away with all the money.

122
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:37,333
If I find him again,
I will set him on fire.

123
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,916
If the police nab him,
he will get jailed again.

124
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,083
He's so snotty!

125
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,750
He took all my money.

126
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,250
Rogue!

127
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,666
Hey, hey.

128
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,166
Hey Chhoti.

129
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,250
Come here.

130
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,666
Where were you? Come.

131
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,416
All of them are rogues.

132
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,416
Wonder where they come from.

133
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,375
They don’t know
who their parents are

134
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,541
nor about their caste or community.

135
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,041
Yes, Aunty.

136
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:25,666
Street children and a wrestler’s pants,
if not kept tight,

137
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,583
-will embarrass you.
-Give me tea.

138
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:28,583
Give me tea.

139
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,916
Giving you tea,
let me finish cleaning first.

140
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,833
Oh God!

141
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,291
Where is she?

142
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,791
Must have gone to
bring disgrace to our family.

143
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,208
You doubt the sacredness
of Lolark Kund.

144
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,916
The priest said
your wife is immoral.

145
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,458
She pretends to take a dip
in the step well.

146
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,125
But, she doesn't even touch the water.

147
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,583
Hail to the Mother Goddess!

148
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,208
It is the most sacred
step well in the world.

149
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,333
Women come from everywhere
to take a dip in it

150
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,166
and get blessed with a son.

151
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:23,333
But, your wife has
given birth to three girls,

152
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,708
and not even one son!

153
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,250
She has tarnished
the image of the entire clan.

154
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:34,583
Hey...

155
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,333
You are back?
Come.

156
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,625
Come, sit here.

157
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,458
Come, please sit.

158
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,500
Sit.

159
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,791
Bittu...

160
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,041
Yes, Dad.

161
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,250
Quickly make tea for your Mom.

162
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
She has taken a dip
and must be feeling cold.

163
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,166
Go, make it quickly.

164
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,916
I... I will make it.

165
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:56,916
Sit, my darling.

166
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,583
Sweety...

167
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,500
Sweety...

168
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,916
Warm up some oil quickly.

169
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,916
Your mother goes barefoot to take
a dip. She must be feeling cold.

170
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,291
If you take care of your mom,

171
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,750
then she will be able to go every day.

172
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,916
God Lolark will be pleased.

173
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,250
And will bless you with a brother.

174
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,750
Right? Go.

175
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:23,791
Am I right?

176
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,125
Tell me, am I right?

177
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,041
Yes.

178
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,916
-What?
-Yes.

179
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,500
I am right?

180
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,333
Do you think I am mad?

181
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,750
Do I look mad?

182
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,041
I know, you go there every day.

183
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,875
But, you don't even
touch the water!

184
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,958
If you don't give
birth to a son in a year...

185
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,958
I will drown you in the same step well.

186
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,166
Now... go.

187
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,625
Get lost! Go.

188
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,916
Chintu, where are you roaming?

189
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,583
You have saved only 60 rupees.

190
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:23,791
Haven't I saved 300 rupees?

191
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,208
Not yet.

192
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:29,541
We walk on the rope and sell flowers also.

193
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,375
It takes a lot of hard work
to earn 300 rupees.

194
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,875
Listen... I have a solution.

195
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,875
-What?
-Will you gamble?

196
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,958
No, I will not gamble.
Chhoti gets upset with me.

197
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:46,208
You will make 300 rupees in just one day.
If you don't tell anything to the police.

198
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,166
Only four months are left, my dear.

199
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,583
You promised Chhoti
to send her to school.

200
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,583
In gambling, sometimes you win
and sometimes you lose.

201
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,416
But this time,
I am sure you will win.

202
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:01,833
Come by tonight.

203
00:17:19,374 --> 00:17:21,374
-Hello.
-Inspector Raja?

204
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:22,416
Salutation, Sir!

205
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,999
There are a lot of complaints
about gambling scandals in your area.

206
00:17:25,124 --> 00:17:26,166
Yes, Sir.

207
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,624
I want all this to close down.

208
00:17:27,749 --> 00:17:32,041
Okay, Sir, will lock all of them.

209
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,458
Lock up anyone caught in gambling.

210
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:35,750
Everyone will be locked.

211
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,291
Raja, if you want a promotion,
get this sorted.

212
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,625
-Should we lock up transgenders too?
-As you wish.

213
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,625
Antiwar, lock up all the gamblers
including children.

214
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,833
You fought with everyone just because
they drove away Bhura.

215
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,000
Yes.

216
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,250
-And where is Bhura?
-He ran away.

217
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,000
Ran away!

218
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,875
-Where will you stay now?
-Don't know.

219
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,500
Don't know!

220
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:01,875
Let's think about it.

221
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,333
-Will you stay with me?
-Yes.

222
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,458
No, you are very naughty.

223
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:09,250
Last time also
you had troubled us a lot.

224
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,791
I don't trouble anyone.
In fact, people trouble me.

225
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:15,833
Naughty girl, as if I don't know
how mischievous you are.

226
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,125
Let's watch this movie?

227
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,208
-No need to watch any movie?
-Please, you never watch any movie.

228
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,333
-I said I will not come.
-Please come.

229
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,500
No movies, please.

230
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,291
Come on, see this.

231
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:36,083
I said no movies,
don't you understand?

232
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,875
You never come along for a movie.

233
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,666
I get scared.

234
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:40,791
Why?

235
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,375
When I was a kid like you,

236
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,791
my parents abandoned me
in this movie hall.

237
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,875
The name of the movie was
Mughal-e-Azam.

238
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,166
So, I named myself Anarkali
after the name of the actress.

239
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:51,708
Understood?

240
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,875
Why did they leave you?

241
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,458
Chhoti, understand one thing.

242
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,125
You receive love as a right;
never beg for it.

243
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,291
But, why did they leave you?

244
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,708
For me!

245
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,833
Chhoti, you go.

246
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,666
-You also come with me.
-I said, go.

247
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,750
Let go.

248
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,208
Leave!

249
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,625
Chhoti, you go.

250
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,125
You didn't come last night?

251
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,000
You should have sent her at least?

252
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,666
I am not your wife that I have
to surrender to you every night.

253
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,250
But you are opening
your mouth a lot these days.

254
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,208
Better keep it shut!

255
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,208
Or else, you will lose your life.

256
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,583
Did you get that?

257
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,375
Come tonight!

258
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:42,916
Or else, will not spare your Chhoti.

259
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,500
You are at the riverbank today also?

260
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,625
You are here all the time?

261
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,833
I mean, you come here every day?

262
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,291
Even I come here every day.

263
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,000
But I have never seen you before.

264
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:15,500
I see... I come here in the afternoon.

265
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,958
You must be coming in the morning
and leaving by noon.

266
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,083
These ants got a sharp sting!

267
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,666
Be careful before sitting.

268
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,916
I walk on the rope in the morning.

269
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,250
Should I show you how?

270
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:32,833
Like this, keeping my hands free
and without any fear.

271
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,416
Sorry for yesterday.

272
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,833
You have forgiven me, right?

273
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,125
I didn't do that intentionally.

274
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:50,791
Foreigners say that if you say sorry,
you get pardoned.

275
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,458
You have forgiven me, right?

276
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,333
You don't speak at all?

277
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,500
Sorry again.

278
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:12,458
These ants only bite me!

279
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,583
Do you know?

280
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,000
Your eyes are like Bhura.

281
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,541
I found him today morning.

282
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,500
He was sitting in a corner
when I went for a bath.

283
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,708
He had big eyes, small hands,

284
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:43,166
small feet... and a cute tail.

285
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,000
-Tail?
-Yes.

286
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,500
A puppy's tail!

287
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,833
He was badly injured.

288
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:57,125
When I petted and loved him,
he started crying.

289
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,458
Why?

290
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,500
Maybe he isn't used
to being loved.

291
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,708
Maybe he isn't used
to being loved.

292
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,500
Sorry for yesterday.

293
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,708
What's the matter?

294
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,791
Today, you are so late?

295
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:40,625
Is everything alright?

296
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:46,208
The room was very dirty.

297
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:48,916
And you've come so late.

298
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:53,041
I was looking for the broom,
but couldn't find it.

299
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,625
Otherwise I would have cleaned the room.

300
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,333
I will clean the room.

301
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:18,791
Had you used so much
vigor with your wife,

302
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:22,333
you would have got a son by now.

303
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:25,083
You bitch!

304
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:49,250
These policemen are troubling us so much.

305
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,000
They neither let us live or die.

306
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,958
I want to be a police officer,
so that I can beat them.

307
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:56,833
I promise to become a police officer,
just to protect you.

308
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,375
No way!

309
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,125
I will throw you in
the River Ganga.

310
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,708
I will swim and come back to you!

311
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:05,500
You talk big things,
but in reality even a calf scares you!

312
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:25,250
Hello!

313
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,000
Good morning!

314
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,541
You tea drink?

315
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:36,208
What?

316
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:37,625
You tea drink?

317
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:42,166
You carry this big book.

318
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:43,750
But you don't know English?

319
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:47,041
Don't worry, I will teach you.

320
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:49,166
Wait, I will get some tea first!

321
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:57,166
Give me two cups of tea.

322
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:59,125
-Do you have money?
-Here it is!

323
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,583
Keep it at a distance.

324
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,166
What the...

325
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:04,291
Wants a two cups of tea!

326
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:05,625
What will you do with two cups?

327
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:08,750
You just give me tea.

328
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:09,875
What will you do with two cups?

329
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,666
You will have one,
what about the other?

330
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,541
For that widow?

331
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:17,708
One untouchable and the other a widow!

332
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:19,458
It's rightfully said...

333
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:24,083
beware of widows, bulls, stairs
and saints to attain salvation.

334
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:27,000
Don't know where the
hell they've come from?

335
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,208
Take it!

336
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:30,166
Go!

337
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:32,208
Have you added sugar?

338
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:34,875
I've put some poison,
will you drink it?

339
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:38,000
If the sugar is less,
I will throw it on your face.

340
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:39,958
What if I throw you
in the River Ganga?

341
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:42,166
Idiot!

342
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:43,958
Miser!

343
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:45,250
Get lost!

344
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:56,583
Take this.

345
00:25:58,541 --> 00:25:59,916
No, I don't drink tea.

346
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:01,958
-Take it.
-No, I can't have it.

347
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:03,500
Hold it, it's very hot.

348
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:08,500
What's your name?

349
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:09,791
Chhoti.

350
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:12,083
What's your real name?

351
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:13,541
Chhoti.

352
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:16,166
That can't be a name.

353
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:18,333
This is how we are named.

354
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:20,333
Anyone who is fat is called 'Fatso'.

355
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,333
Anyone with one leg is called 'Lame'.

356
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,666
I am small, so I am called 'Chhoti'.

357
00:26:27,916 --> 00:26:29,375
You must be having another name?

358
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:33,041
Do these stray dogs have any names?

359
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,083
Where are you going?

360
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:55,083
Hey!

361
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:01,000
She wasted my money.

362
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:02,708
She didn't even have the tea.

363
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,458
Chhoti!

364
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:49,958
Such a sweet name.

365
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,083
With her small hands

366
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:55,208
she was driving away flies around my tea.

367
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:56,333
What?

368
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:57,958
You had tea?

369
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:03,000
We are only allowed to have
rice and water.

370
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:07,375
Someone thought about me
for the first time.

371
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:11,083
I always had my doubts about you.

372
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:13,416
Still, I gave you shelter here.

373
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:15,583
Such a small girl and talking so sensibly.

374
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:18,291
Allowed you to stay in my room.

375
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:22,083
And gave you food to eat.

376
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:24,958
-You sinner!
-Couldn't have the tea.

377
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:28,500
I will tell everyone what you
do outside the Ashram.

378
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,041
She must have felt bad.

379
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,500
Such a small girl.

380
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:33,916
You've made the room so dirty!

381
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:35,916
And now you are off to sleep.

382
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:37,750
Get up and clean everything.

383
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:19,791
I've got sacred food for you.
Have it.

384
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:23,208
Do you know?

385
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:26,291
When I came to this riverbank,

386
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:29,541
all the children would bully me a lot.

387
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:30,833
Hmm.

388
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:33,208
But, Chintu would
always protect me.

389
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,708
He would say...

390
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:39,333
"Don't worry, Chhoti,
Chintu is there for you."

391
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:45,708
He would always return
before the prayers get over.

392
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,833
But, he didn't come back.

393
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,333
Where did he go?

394
00:29:50,041 --> 00:29:52,083
He picked a fight with the cops.

395
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,000
Don't know.

396
00:29:58,291 --> 00:29:59,333
Never mind.

397
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:04,916
Things that are ours,
always find a way back to us.

398
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:10,125
Don't worry, eat this.

399
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,750
Should I wear this and go?

400
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:28,125
Wait, you'll ruin them.

401
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,125
It's pure leather.

402
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:32,750
Go, get the brush.

403
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,500
Give it to me!

404
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:50,250
I need some money.

405
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:54,250
Why? Is your Mother getting married?

406
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:59,083
No, I have to pay the school fees.

407
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,541
The school has sent a notice.

408
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:05,916
Did I ask you to send them to school?

409
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:12,833
Let them be at home
and train them in household chores.

410
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,625
Or else, they will also ruin
their husband's house like you.

411
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,625
But education is important too.

412
00:31:22,791 --> 00:31:24,541
Just give me a son, not wisdom!

413
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:30,666
Why do you always wear a white saree?

414
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:33,083
Why not a colorful one?

415
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:36,291
There is an age-old tradition.

416
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:40,666
Once a woman's husband dies,

417
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:43,416
she has to wear only white.

418
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,833
Why?

419
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:51,666
So that she always remains colorless.

420
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:53,416
Okay.

421
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,833
Which is your favorite color?

422
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,916
What is favorite?

423
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:01,500
Favorite.

424
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,750
What's that?

425
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:06,875
You don't know English at all.

426
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:12,000
Which color you like the most?

427
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:15,125
Pink.

428
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:16,875
-Pink?
-The pink that

429
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:19,375
Queens of Jaipur often wear.

430
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:21,750
The deep shade of pink!

431
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:23,916
I see.

432
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:25,250
I am leaving now.

433
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:27,083
You come tomorrow evening.

434
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,833
Where?

435
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:31,541
Come for evening prayers
at the riverbank.

436
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:33,875
-But, I can't come in the evening.
-No excuses.

437
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,083
I am not allowed to leave
the ashram in the evening.

438
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:37,041
You have to come.

439
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:40,291
I will get Anarkali also.
You have to come, please.

440
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:20,375
Stay away!

441
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:24,500
How many times have I told you
to stay away from my belongings?

442
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:32,916
You are already tainted
and want me to become a sinner?

443
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,375
Oh God, give her some wisdom.

444
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:22,291
-Hail Rukmini!
-Hail Radha!

445
00:34:22,624 --> 00:34:25,708
-Hail Rukmini!
-Hail Radha!

446
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:29,666
Hail Lord Krishna
Who dons peacock feathers!

447
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:32,874
Hail Lord Krishna
Who dons peacock feathers!

448
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:20,583
Good...

449
00:35:21,875 --> 00:35:23,291
Good...

450
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:26,625
Good morning,
you can't even say it properly.

451
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,208
Good morning,
you can't even say it properly.

452
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:36,541
You embarrassed me yesterday
and now you are laughing.

453
00:35:37,791 --> 00:35:39,208
Sorry.

454
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,125
I had told everyone
my friend was coming.

455
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,833
Anarkali also came there.

456
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,750
You let me down.

457
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:51,208
I was trying to call you
but didn't know your name.

458
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,666
My name is Noor.

459
00:35:57,791 --> 00:35:58,750
Noor?

460
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:00,083
What kind of a name is this?

461
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:03,458
My Grandfather used to say
that when I was born

462
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:07,208
my face was glowing like the Kohinoor!

463
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,500
That's why he named me Noor.

464
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,958
What's Kohinoor?

465
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:13,500
'Kohinoor' is the name
of a precious Heera, a diamond.

466
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:17,958
Heera? That's
the name of that fat cop.

467
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:20,208
You know what happened once?

468
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:22,916
That policeman Heera was chasing everyone.

469
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:27,333
While running, Chintu's pants came off.

470
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:34,125
But, he kept running
without his pants... naked!

471
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:40,500
Do you know?

472
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:44,250
These lamps are lit twice.

473
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:47,083
Once, when you ask for something.

474
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:49,666
And then, once again
when your wish is fulfilled.

475
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,625
-I see.
-Yes.

476
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,958
Which means all those
who bought lamps from me

477
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:55,708
will come back to buy it one more time?

478
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:57,291
Yes, they will.

479
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:59,250
Have you ever lit a lamp?

480
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:02,833
Yes, I have lit it once.

481
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:04,458
-When?
-When I got married.

482
00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:08,750
I was married off to an old man.

483
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:12,291
But he died after some time.

484
00:37:12,416 --> 00:37:13,916
-Your husband was old?
-Yes.

485
00:37:15,458 --> 00:37:17,333
What's there to laugh?

486
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:20,958
I said my husband was old
and you are laughing.

487
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:23,166
Let me help you.

488
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:24,875
Take this.

489
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:52,583
Chhoti, wait for me.

490
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:55,291
I promise to return before
the prayers get over.

491
00:38:18,791 --> 00:38:20,125
What are you doing here?

492
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,791
How did you come here?

493
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:24,625
I came here looking for you.

494
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:27,083
Where have you been
for the last two days?

495
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:28,458
What happened?

496
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:33,333
I want you to meet Noor tomorrow.

497
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:36,833
I can't come tomorrow.

498
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:38,250
Well...

499
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,125
I have a dance show tomorrow.

500
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:44,333
I want the two of you to meet.

501
00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:46,541
Sometimes, she is not there
and at times, you are not there.

502
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,708
I am the only one trying so hard.

503
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:50,458
I don't want to introduce anyone anymore.

504
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:52,250
-Wonder where Chintu has gone.
-Chhoti.

505
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:54,333
-Now you two refused to meet...
-She doesn't even listen.

506
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:56,625
-My life is messed up!
-Chhoti...

507
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:15,125
Where's Anarkali?

508
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:17,291
She has a dance show elsewhere.

509
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:19,833
But I came to meet her.

510
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:21,666
Let her be.

511
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:23,583
I've got something for you.

512
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:26,583
What?

513
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:28,000
Look!

514
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,958
No! No, no...

515
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:33,833
No, I am not allowed.

516
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,083
Meaning?

517
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,916
It means I cannot apply any color.

518
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:40,166
No, I will apply it.
You will look very pretty with color.

519
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:41,333
No, Chhoti. What are you doing?

520
00:39:41,666 --> 00:39:42,750
What are you doing?

521
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:44,250
Don't do it, Chhoti.

522
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,333
Someone might see us.

523
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:49,208
Don't do it.

524
00:39:49,958 --> 00:39:51,041
Please let me do it.

525
00:39:51,166 --> 00:39:52,708
Enough, stop it now.

526
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:57,666
It looks so pretty!

527
00:39:58,541 --> 00:39:59,750
Enough, stop it now.

528
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,666
Hey!

529
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:04,458
Where's Anarkali?

530
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:05,875
I don't know.

531
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:09,375
What are you doing? Get out of here.

532
00:40:11,166 --> 00:40:12,458
You pretend to be this big cop.

533
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:14,166
Can't handle your pants,
how will you handle Banaras?

534
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:15,208
Get lost!

535
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:16,375
Let's go, Chhoti.

536
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:18,166
Where are you taking me?

537
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,500
I am taking you to a place
where nobody comes.

538
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:22,166
Come.

539
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:24,708
-Come.
-Where have you brought me?

540
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:29,041
Every time I make a mistake,
I come here to hide.

541
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:33,083
Have you been scared of colors
since childhood?

542
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:36,791
No, I used to play a lot with colors
when I was a child.

543
00:40:37,291 --> 00:40:39,250
I used to dress like Radha during Holi,

544
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:41,958
and would dance and play with colors.

545
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:43,083
I see.

546
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,333
This year, you will play Holi with me.

547
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:49,583
No, now I don't celebrate Holi.
I am not allowed to play Holi.

548
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:51,291
No, no, whatever you say.

549
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:53,250
This Holi, I will splash color on you.

550
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:54,958
This is my promise to you.

551
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:57,166
No, Chhoti. Now, I can't play with colors.

552
00:40:57,916 --> 00:40:59,750
You used to dance like Radha?

553
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,500
Please dance and show me once.

554
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:05,583
-No, now I can't dance.
-No, please show me.

555
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:08,458
-I said I am not allowed to dance.
-No, you will show me!

556
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:11,416
For my sake.

557
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:16,458
You are very stubborn.

558
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:24,916
Oh, the Ganges!

559
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:29,958
Oh, the Ganges!

560
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:33,500
-Hail the Ganges River!
-Oh, the Ganges!

561
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:39,875
-Hail the Ganges River!
-Oh, the Ganges!

562
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,583
Hail the Ganges River!

563
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:45,083
Hail the Ganges River!

564
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:47,708
Hail the Ganges River!

565
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:51,291
Hail the Ganges River!

566
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:54,250
Hail the Ganges River!

567
00:41:55,708 --> 00:41:57,250
Hail the Ganges River!

568
00:41:57,375 --> 00:42:00,500
-Oh, the Ganges!
-Hail the Ganges River!

569
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:03,750
-Oh, the Ganges!
-Hail the Ganges River!

570
00:42:03,875 --> 00:42:08,958
-Oh, the Ganges!
-Hail the Ganges River!

571
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:42,250
-Hail the Ganges River!
-Oh, the Ganges!

572
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:45,416
-Hail the Ganges River!
-Oh, the Ganges!

573
00:42:45,541 --> 00:42:48,500
-Hail the Ganges River!
-Oh, the Ganges!

574
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:52,250
-Hail the Ganges River!
-Oh, the Ganges!

575
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:56,166
Oh, the Ganges!

576
00:42:56,458 --> 00:42:58,666
Oh, the Ganges!

577
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:05,625
-Oh, the Ganges!
-Hail the Ganges River!

578
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:01,666
Noor, are your dead? Open the door.

579
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:05,625
Mom, Pari is troubling me.

580
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:07,791
Pari, don't trouble her.

581
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:12,541
Finish your homework,
then I will serve lunch.

582
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:34,625
Shall I feed you some more?

583
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:41,458
I don't want to eat lentils,
I want to eat okra.

584
00:44:41,583 --> 00:44:43,208
I will make okra for you tomorrow.

585
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:46,333
Yes, yes, feed them.

586
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:47,958
You have put an end to my lineage.

587
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:50,125
Now, sell this house to feed them.

588
00:45:42,291 --> 00:45:43,166
Hey, girl.

589
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:44,333
Come here.

590
00:45:46,416 --> 00:45:47,875
Yes, you! I am calling you only.

591
00:45:48,291 --> 00:45:49,416
Come here.

592
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:56,625
Do you want money?
Very good, come quickly.

593
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,458
What a target!
It fell right on her head.

594
00:46:07,916 --> 00:46:09,166
How did this happen?

595
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:13,625
I don't know where Chintu is.
Every time he would come back,

596
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:15,250
but he hasn't returned this time.

597
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:17,166
How did your hair get so dirty?

598
00:46:18,791 --> 00:46:21,958
I wait for him every day
even after the prayers end.

599
00:46:22,375 --> 00:46:23,458
But he doesn't come.

600
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:24,833
Who did this?

601
00:46:25,708 --> 00:46:28,791
That truck driver spat.
He does this always.

602
00:46:28,916 --> 00:46:31,041
Bring your head a little forward.

603
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,833
Take care of your dress, tuck it behind.

604
00:46:35,333 --> 00:46:38,000
But how did this happen?
Didn't you stop him?

605
00:46:39,375 --> 00:46:41,500
He sits high up in his truck.

606
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:43,291
Don't you say anything to him?

607
00:46:44,333 --> 00:46:46,166
No, what can I say.

608
00:46:48,041 --> 00:46:49,500
Such mannerless people!

609
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,083
Gross! Spitting on a child. Oh, God!

610
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:57,708
What do these people gain
by doing such things?

611
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:05,125
Chhoti, you will come across such people
several times in your life.

612
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:09,916
People who want to put you down,
defeat you and suppress you.

613
00:47:10,583 --> 00:47:13,708
Never be afraid and never back down.

614
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:15,333
Did you understand?

615
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:18,166
They call you an untouchable, right?

616
00:47:19,166 --> 00:47:22,000
You rise so high...

617
00:47:23,083 --> 00:47:27,708
scale such heights that these people
cannot even touch you!

618
00:47:30,375 --> 00:47:31,541
Right?

619
00:47:32,291 --> 00:47:34,583
I hope you understood what I said.

620
00:47:35,166 --> 00:47:37,583
Come, the hair are almost dry now.

621
00:47:37,875 --> 00:47:40,916
You get delicious porridge
at the Annapurna temple.

622
00:47:41,166 --> 00:47:42,708
I will get it for you.

623
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:48,083
Look there, that kite is flying so high!

624
00:47:51,416 --> 00:47:58,125
One day, I will also fly away
like this kite. Far, far away.

625
00:47:59,166 --> 00:48:01,041
Only if I let you go.

626
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:04,500
You can't do anything.

627
00:48:04,625 --> 00:48:07,375
Everyone has to go one day,
that's the rule.

628
00:48:08,583 --> 00:48:10,708
Let others go, they are not my family.

629
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:14,083
You are my family.
I will not let you go anywhere.

630
00:48:15,791 --> 00:48:16,625
Let me go for now.

631
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,958
If I am late, they will not
let me enter the Ashram.

632
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:20,416
Where will I stay then?

633
00:48:20,916 --> 00:48:22,000
Come now.

634
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:25,875
Look, how unevenly I made your braids!

635
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:28,000
I will make them again for you.

636
00:49:28,375 --> 00:49:33,208
With us around, don't even dare
to get close to our boss' house.

637
00:49:33,541 --> 00:49:35,791
You will to go to my house?

638
00:49:37,041 --> 00:49:38,458
Will you?

639
00:49:42,791 --> 00:49:44,041
Will you?

640
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:45,833
Tell me. You will go to my house?

641
00:49:48,875 --> 00:49:51,458
-Will you?
-Yes, I will go.

642
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:55,541
I will go to every lane,
every neighborhood.

643
00:49:56,708 --> 00:49:59,500
I will tell the whole world that...

644
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:04,750
Raja Raghuvanshi acts very manly,

645
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:07,041
but does it with a eunuch.

646
00:50:07,166 --> 00:50:11,375
He forces himself on one
and that too for free.

647
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:18,333
What if I shoot you
and push Chhoti into flesh trade?

648
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:19,958
Tell me?

649
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,375
Should I push her into flesh trade?

650
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:23,875
Tell me!

651
00:50:38,625 --> 00:50:39,916
Hey, girl, come here.

652
00:50:55,583 --> 00:50:57,208
Come here. Come here.

653
00:50:58,041 --> 00:50:59,166
-What's the matter?
-Come here.

654
00:50:59,666 --> 00:51:01,000
Have you gone mad?

655
00:51:02,541 --> 00:51:04,000
-What happened?
-You know what happened?

656
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:05,083
No.

657
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:08,833
That truck driver
was chewing betel leaf like this.

658
00:51:11,625 --> 00:51:13,875
I threw dung on him.

659
00:51:16,833 --> 00:51:18,250
Right on his face!

660
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:27,791
Where is it gone? Where is the hole?

661
00:51:27,916 --> 00:51:30,291
How did the mosquito enter last night?

662
00:51:30,416 --> 00:51:34,625
It was stinging so sharply.

663
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:39,833
Be grateful that I haven't told anyone
in the Ashram yet.

664
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:45,166
Had I done so, you would
have been thrown out!

665
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,208
Here is the hole.

666
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,708
Darn! Oh, God.

667
00:51:50,166 --> 00:51:51,875
Useless...

668
00:52:12,791 --> 00:52:14,666
Oh my dear God.

669
00:52:24,791 --> 00:52:27,083
Why are you doing
all this unnecessary work?

670
00:52:27,541 --> 00:52:28,708
Come on.

671
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:31,000
Look, there is hole in the mosquito net.

672
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:32,833
Stitch it up.

673
00:52:33,666 --> 00:52:35,916
Else the mosquitoes will get in
and bite me again.

674
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:38,541
Oh, dear Goddess.

675
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,916
I've been looking for you for the
past two days and you are sitting here.

676
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:58,500
What happened to you?

677
00:52:59,958 --> 00:53:03,208
I had a fall at a dance show.

678
00:53:04,125 --> 00:53:05,958
You fell while dancing?

679
00:53:07,208 --> 00:53:08,958
Why? What happened?

680
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:12,791
Why don't you come home at night?

681
00:53:12,916 --> 00:53:14,500
I get scared alone.

682
00:53:15,833 --> 00:53:18,750
Chhoti, you go.
I will surely come home tonight.

683
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,333
But you stay away from Raja and his goons.

684
00:53:23,416 --> 00:53:25,375
Please come tonight.

685
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:44,875
Boo!

686
00:53:46,708 --> 00:53:48,625
Will you come with me to a special place?

687
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:51,500
Please come.

688
00:53:52,916 --> 00:53:54,416
Please, come along!

689
00:53:54,541 --> 00:53:56,208
Where are you taking me?

690
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,833
Please come with me.

691
00:53:58,791 --> 00:53:59,833
Come.

692
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:01,083
Where are your slippers?

693
00:54:01,208 --> 00:54:02,500
Right there.

694
00:54:02,625 --> 00:54:04,291
-Go wear them.
-Okay.

695
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:09,000
Come.

696
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:13,375
Come, Noor, don't be scared.

697
00:54:20,041 --> 00:54:21,166
Come.

698
00:54:27,833 --> 00:54:29,000
Sit down.

699
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:32,875
Brother...

700
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,208
Yes.

701
00:54:34,333 --> 00:54:35,958
How many samosas in one plate?

702
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,625
Two.

703
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,250
Give me two!

704
00:54:41,666 --> 00:54:43,666
Do you eat the potato filling
of the samosa ?

705
00:54:44,583 --> 00:54:46,291
I only eat the crispy crust.

706
00:54:46,541 --> 00:54:48,416
Chintu eats the potato filling.

707
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:51,708
I love to eat the crust
with the red chutney.

708
00:54:53,416 --> 00:54:55,541
You always carry this book with you.

709
00:54:57,208 --> 00:54:58,708
What is so special about it?

710
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:00,458
It has Tagore's poems.

711
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:02,958
My grandfather gave it to me.

712
00:55:03,625 --> 00:55:05,958
I always keep it
under the holy basil plant.

713
00:55:06,916 --> 00:55:08,333
Is Tagore your grandfather?

714
00:55:08,708 --> 00:55:11,458
No, Tagore was a great poet.

715
00:55:13,041 --> 00:55:14,625
My grandfather used to say

716
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:20,166
that the Ganges River flows towards
Tagore's house to listen to his poems.

717
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:21,791
Read them out to me.

718
00:55:23,666 --> 00:55:24,958
I don't know to read.

719
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:30,125
Your grandfather didn't teach you to read?

720
00:55:31,625 --> 00:55:32,916
No, he wanted to.

721
00:55:34,375 --> 00:55:36,375
The country had just
gained independence then.

722
00:55:38,208 --> 00:55:42,291
My grandfather would say
that for the country to progress,

723
00:55:42,583 --> 00:55:45,125
it is imperative
that we educate our daughters.

724
00:55:46,083 --> 00:55:48,541
But my family was against it.

725
00:55:48,666 --> 00:55:50,833
They wanted me to do household chores.

726
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:54,583
Then they got me married off
and I went to my husband's home.

727
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,375
Have I told you that Chintu had
also promised to send me to school?

728
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,625
Boss!

729
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:02,083
I've been living in Banaras
for four years.

730
00:56:02,208 --> 00:56:05,333
I don't want to become impious
by serving them.

731
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:06,791
Switch off the fan!

732
00:56:07,083 --> 00:56:09,833
Don't know where they come from
to enjoy the cool air for free.

733
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:15,541
Let's go.

734
00:56:15,666 --> 00:56:17,291
Let him get the samosa.

735
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:18,500
I told you, let's go.

736
00:56:19,666 --> 00:56:22,583
Get lost! Don't come back again!

737
00:56:33,625 --> 00:56:34,833
You were lying.

738
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:36,583
Nothing will ever change.

739
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:38,458
We are untouchables
and will remain untouchables!

740
00:56:38,583 --> 00:56:40,375
We are dogs and will remain dogs!

741
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:44,291
You shouldn't talk like that, my dear.

742
00:56:46,166 --> 00:56:50,000
Do you know, when I was a young girl,

743
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:54,041
my grandfather had brought me
to the riverbank for the first time.

744
00:56:55,666 --> 00:56:58,541
That day, it suddenly became dark
even during the day!

745
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:04,958
A small moon eclipsed such a big sun!

746
00:57:06,208 --> 00:57:07,750
The sun wins every day.

747
00:57:09,291 --> 00:57:11,000
But the moon too has its day!

748
00:57:11,583 --> 00:57:13,833
I am Chhoti, I am not the moon.

749
00:57:16,541 --> 00:57:20,625
When you join your hands,
the lines form a crescent moon!

750
00:57:22,791 --> 00:57:25,041
From today, one half is yours...

751
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:28,583
and the other half is mine.

752
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:51,958
Fifty kilograms of rice in 15 days.

753
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:56,708
Not even a kilogram of rice is left.

754
00:57:56,833 --> 00:57:58,041
They eat so much.

755
00:57:58,166 --> 00:58:00,541
They are all becoming fat.

756
00:58:02,916 --> 00:58:04,791
-Who eats so much!
-Asha.

757
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:09,250
Is it very difficult to read and write?

758
00:58:10,416 --> 00:58:11,958
Not for me.

759
00:58:14,041 --> 00:58:16,625
Will you teach me to read and write?

760
00:58:17,666 --> 00:58:19,708
What? Love letters?

761
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:21,250
I don't have the time.

762
00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:22,833
Go and learn from someone else.

763
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,916
20 kg or 5 kg....

764
00:58:45,333 --> 00:58:47,500
Look, she is taking a packet
of colors for the widow.

765
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:49,875
Hello, where are you going?

766
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:56,166
Do you know what that widow
is saying behind your back?

767
00:58:57,083 --> 00:58:59,750
She says you are all dogs!

768
00:59:00,458 --> 00:59:02,083
You are untouchables!

769
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:06,375
I heard you stole nail polish for her.

770
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:10,000
You even took her out for samosas
with the stolen money.

771
00:59:10,708 --> 00:59:12,625
She only told me all this.

772
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,625
She ran away!

773
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:15,958
She stole nail polish?

774
00:59:16,083 --> 00:59:18,458
Yes! These are children
from the riverbank.

775
00:59:18,833 --> 00:59:21,750
You wouldn't know if they stole your
underpants from inside your pants!

776
00:59:22,041 --> 00:59:23,666
Then what is a nail polish!

777
00:59:38,416 --> 00:59:39,500
Hey.

778
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:44,875
I want to show you something.

779
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,875
I don't want to see anything.

780
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:50,583
Why? What's the matter, Chhoti?

781
00:59:52,833 --> 00:59:54,291
I don't want to talk to anyone.

782
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:56,583
Why?

783
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:01,250
I don't want to be friends with anyone.

784
01:00:01,375 --> 01:00:03,250
What happened?

785
01:00:07,458 --> 01:00:08,458
Chhoti.

786
01:00:10,291 --> 01:00:12,166
Why did you call me moon?

787
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:14,958
What if I would have believed you?

788
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:18,791
I will never meet you again.

789
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,666
Go, sit there!

790
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:51,666
In spite of our warnings,
this bitch went to your house again.

791
01:00:51,791 --> 01:00:54,125
Not only did she go there,
she even told them everything.

792
01:00:54,416 --> 01:00:58,666
She even told your wife
that you are chasing Chhoti.

793
01:00:59,208 --> 01:01:02,666
She has become so bold that she
has called a journalist from Delhi.

794
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,958
Sir, if we don't finish her now,
then we will be finished.

795
01:01:22,333 --> 01:01:23,625
I had warned you.

796
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:32,041
As long as you bow to me...

797
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:34,791
you will stay alive.

798
01:01:35,416 --> 01:01:36,791
Understood?

799
01:01:42,666 --> 01:01:44,583
You will tell the world?

800
01:01:45,291 --> 01:01:47,166
You will tell the world?

801
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:53,333
I am Raja! Raja, the king!

802
01:01:58,541 --> 01:02:00,041
The court here is mine!

803
01:02:02,666 --> 01:02:05,958
And the verdict is also mine! Get it?

804
01:02:13,625 --> 01:02:16,291
Motherfucker!

805
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:24,541
Chhoti!

806
01:02:24,666 --> 01:02:25,833
Anarkali!

807
01:02:26,916 --> 01:02:28,250
Anarkali!

808
01:02:34,166 --> 01:02:36,791
-Catch that scamp!
-Let's catch her!

809
01:03:32,583 --> 01:03:34,041
Hey, Aunty.

810
01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:35,583
Did you hear the news?

811
01:03:35,916 --> 01:03:37,625
Anarkali was murdered!

812
01:03:38,083 --> 01:03:39,416
Do you know who killed her?

813
01:03:39,791 --> 01:03:42,000
Your Chhoti and her friends.

814
01:03:42,416 --> 01:03:44,375
They killed her for money.

815
01:03:44,666 --> 01:03:46,958
Didn't I warn you about these children
from the riverbank?

816
01:03:47,416 --> 01:03:49,125
The day after tomorrow is Holi.

817
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:53,166
Be careful she doesn't splash color
on your white saree.

818
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:40,916
Chhoti!

819
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:43,208
What are you doing here?

820
01:04:43,666 --> 01:04:45,708
Come, get up, my dear.

821
01:04:46,625 --> 01:04:48,041
I was searching for you
all over the place.

822
01:04:48,166 --> 01:04:50,416
Come on. Come out.

823
01:04:50,541 --> 01:04:51,625
Nothing will happen.

824
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:54,750
I am here with you. Come, sit here.

825
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:57,625
I searched for you everywhere.

826
01:04:58,083 --> 01:05:00,500
-Killed Anarkali!
-Wait.

827
01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:04,000
Water first. Drink water first.

828
01:05:05,541 --> 01:05:07,375
Drink it. Open your mouth.

829
01:05:11,166 --> 01:05:15,875
Raja threw Anarkali from the top!

830
01:05:19,708 --> 01:05:23,375
He killed her and now he will kill me.

831
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:27,000
Shh.

832
01:05:27,375 --> 01:05:30,041
You don't know anything.
Keep quiet, absolutely quiet.

833
01:05:30,166 --> 01:05:34,833
Don't say a word to anyone.

834
01:05:35,583 --> 01:05:37,166
Quiet.

835
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,583
Don't say anything to anybody.

836
01:05:41,333 --> 01:05:45,375
No, no, stop crying.

837
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:49,500
Everything will be fine.

838
01:05:50,041 --> 01:05:51,583
Shh... come.

839
01:05:52,541 --> 01:05:53,916
-Come, come quickly.
-Are you Noor?

840
01:05:54,041 --> 01:05:54,875
And is she Chhoti?

841
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,041
I am Rekha Saxena,
a journalist from Delhi.

842
01:05:58,166 --> 01:06:00,333
I have come here to write a story
about police corruption.

843
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:02,500
I have come here to write a story
about police corruption.

844
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:05,416
My sources tell me that the cops
are involved in Anarkali's murder.

845
01:06:05,541 --> 01:06:06,833
And they are framing Chhoti.

846
01:06:06,958 --> 01:06:09,500
Isn't it true? Tell me?

847
01:06:09,625 --> 01:06:11,750
Don't talk to her, please leave.

848
01:06:11,875 --> 01:06:13,625
Outsiders are not allowed in the Ashram.

849
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:15,125
Please try to understand me.

850
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:16,500
-I can save her.
-Let's go.

851
01:06:16,625 --> 01:06:17,625
Tell me, child.

852
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:19,958
Raja killed Anarkali, didn't he?

853
01:06:20,083 --> 01:06:21,166
Tell me.

854
01:06:22,666 --> 01:06:25,625
Come on. Don't cry.

855
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:34,625
Sit here.

856
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:44,333
Sorry.

857
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:48,416
Sorry.

858
01:06:56,583 --> 01:06:58,666
Look, what I have made for you.

859
01:07:08,541 --> 01:07:09,791
Look at this.

860
01:07:09,916 --> 01:07:12,333
It's a dress.

861
01:07:12,916 --> 01:07:15,916
I have also stitched a pocket in it.

862
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:17,583
It's nice, isn't it?

863
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:25,791
It's okay, my dear.

864
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:34,500
We will leave this city tonight.

865
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,583
But where will we go?

866
01:07:41,416 --> 01:07:44,875
I have never crossed the Ganges till date.

867
01:07:47,833 --> 01:07:49,000
Where will we go?

868
01:07:51,416 --> 01:07:53,166
Can we go to Tagore's house?

869
01:07:56,375 --> 01:07:57,833
What?

870
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,250
Let's go to Tagore's house.

871
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,250
Kolkata!

872
01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:06,833
All right.

873
01:08:07,791 --> 01:08:09,541
We will go to Kolkata.

874
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:12,791
We shall go to Kolkata.

875
01:08:13,083 --> 01:08:14,833
I'll get some water for you.

876
01:08:16,083 --> 01:08:19,041
Over there,
I will earn by stitching clothes

877
01:08:19,291 --> 01:08:21,291
and get you educated.

878
01:08:22,791 --> 01:08:24,833
Drink water.
I will get you highly educated.

879
01:08:24,958 --> 01:08:26,208
Come on, drink water.

880
01:08:26,333 --> 01:08:28,583
Can we take Chintu with us?

881
01:08:31,874 --> 01:08:33,916
We will take Chintu with us as well.

882
01:08:38,791 --> 01:08:41,083
You haven't eaten anything
for past two days, have you?

883
01:08:41,374 --> 01:08:43,041
I'll get you something to eat.

884
01:08:43,666 --> 01:08:45,291
Okay? Drink the water.

885
01:08:45,416 --> 01:08:47,041
And then go and hide over there.

886
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:49,833
Open the door when I call for you.

887
01:08:49,958 --> 01:08:51,291
I'll be right back.

888
01:08:55,249 --> 01:08:58,041
Then, can I call you "Ma"?

889
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:38,250
Chhoti!

890
01:10:46,458 --> 01:10:48,333
-Chhoti.
-Noor!

891
01:10:48,458 --> 01:10:49,500
Come on!

892
01:10:50,875 --> 01:10:52,041
Noor!

893
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:53,583
Noor!

894
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:56,000
Chhoti, run!

895
01:10:56,125 --> 01:10:58,291
Noor!

896
01:10:58,416 --> 01:10:59,625
Noor!

897
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,250
Noor!

898
01:11:02,666 --> 01:11:03,833
Chhoti!

899
01:11:05,041 --> 01:11:10,833
How many times have I said that
outsiders are not allowed in the Ashram?

900
01:11:11,125 --> 01:11:14,083
But some people just don't listen.

901
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:16,875
Chhoti... Chhoti.

902
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,083
Look... look at her nail polish.

903
01:11:19,625 --> 01:11:21,708
If you liked dressing up so much,

904
01:11:21,833 --> 01:11:23,750
then you should have got married again.

905
01:11:26,833 --> 01:11:28,833
Come. Come, bitch.

906
01:11:31,625 --> 01:11:33,708
Has the police come
to the Ashram ever before?

907
01:11:33,833 --> 01:11:35,708
They came here because of this wretch!

908
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:39,625
-Chhoti!
-Come on!

909
01:11:42,083 --> 01:11:44,708
-Noor!
-Chhoti!

910
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:48,875
Noor!

911
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:54,958
Bahadur, she is not just any other girl.

912
01:11:55,541 --> 01:11:57,333
She's trouble!

913
01:11:57,458 --> 01:12:02,291
If we leave her, she will paint
the whole of Banaras.

914
01:12:02,416 --> 01:12:06,500
Don't know what the police will do
with that little girl.

915
01:12:07,041 --> 01:12:08,541
Chhoti...

916
01:12:08,666 --> 01:12:10,708
There is only one solution to this.

917
01:12:13,166 --> 01:12:14,416
Noor!

918
01:12:14,916 --> 01:12:17,250
-Sir, she will drown!
-Keep quiet!

919
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:20,958
-Sir, pull the rope! This is not right.
-Quiet!

920
01:12:21,083 --> 01:12:22,750
Don't interfere in senior's work.

921
01:12:22,875 --> 01:12:25,666
-She is just a child!
-Idiot, sit there!

922
01:12:28,041 --> 01:12:30,541
Trying to show how honest you are!

923
01:12:32,416 --> 01:12:34,375
If the journalist Rekha Saxena
from Delhi asks,

924
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:37,583
we will say she drowned while escaping.

925
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:54,958
Oh, the Ganges!

926
01:12:55,083 --> 01:12:58,916
Oh, the Ganges!

927
01:13:12,833 --> 01:13:15,625
Today, Mother Ganges
has come here herself?

928
01:13:16,583 --> 01:13:18,500
Sir, no.

929
01:13:20,416 --> 01:13:23,250
She did not drown despite
being under water for half an hour.

930
01:13:24,625 --> 01:13:26,875
She has blessings of Mother Ganges.

931
01:13:27,916 --> 01:13:31,000
If anyone touches her,
we all will be burnt to ashes.

932
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:34,291
If we spare her, we will not be spared.

933
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:38,208
And her journalist "Mother"
has also come from Delhi.

934
01:13:38,875 --> 01:13:41,625
She will embarrass me
in the whole of Banaras.

935
01:13:42,791 --> 01:13:44,375
What the hell are you waiting for?

936
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:46,458
Lock her in the men's cell!

937
01:13:46,583 --> 01:13:49,500
-Yes, sir.
-But, sir...

938
01:13:50,833 --> 01:13:52,166
Stand here only!

939
01:14:01,416 --> 01:14:03,208
You have made us chase you for too long.

940
01:14:03,333 --> 01:14:04,583
Now rot in jail!

941
01:14:16,041 --> 01:14:18,791
Sir, he has been troubling us for a while.

942
01:14:18,916 --> 01:14:20,750
He is insisting that we release Chhoti.

943
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:23,958
Go there!

944
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:29,916
So gambler, you want to become
an inspector for Chhoti?

945
01:14:30,291 --> 01:14:33,166
You were released yesterday
after four months,

946
01:14:33,291 --> 01:14:34,750
you're back here again?

947
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:37,791
Do you want to rot in the prison
for your entire life?

948
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:42,208
And you want me to get into trouble
because of Chhoti?

949
01:14:42,625 --> 01:14:44,958
You want to save Chhoti?

950
01:14:46,291 --> 01:14:47,708
You want to save Chhoti?

951
01:14:49,041 --> 01:14:53,291
Look at him, he is scaring me!

952
01:14:56,208 --> 01:14:57,375
Rascal!

953
01:15:09,666 --> 01:15:12,333
Sir, you are amazing!

954
01:15:13,666 --> 01:15:14,750
Where is Chhoti?

955
01:15:15,958 --> 01:15:17,041
Madam?

956
01:15:17,166 --> 01:15:18,125
-Ashok ji.
-Yes, sir.

957
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:19,583
Get some sweets for madam.

958
01:15:19,708 --> 01:15:20,958
I'll get it right away.

959
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:22,625
-Hurry up!
-Where is Chhoti?

960
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:25,500
Chhoti? We are also searching for her.

961
01:15:25,625 --> 01:15:27,875
-Do you know where she is?
-Stop talking nonsense!

962
01:15:28,125 --> 01:15:29,625
You don't know who I am!

963
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:32,625
I know who you are, madam,
that's why I ordered for sweets.

964
01:15:33,416 --> 01:15:35,916
Or else, I don't even
offer poison for free.

965
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,125
I will call people in Delhi
and get you suspended.

966
01:15:40,541 --> 01:15:42,500
Look, madam, this is a police station,

967
01:15:42,916 --> 01:15:44,416
not your TV channel.

968
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:47,083
We act only on written orders,
not just talks.

969
01:15:48,375 --> 01:15:49,625
Go and get the papers.

970
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:51,416
I will not spare you.

971
01:15:51,875 --> 01:15:53,708
Then catch me.

972
01:15:53,833 --> 01:15:57,208
But not now, I have oil on me.
It's slippery.

973
01:15:59,125 --> 01:16:01,208
You don't have any idea what I can do.

974
01:16:01,583 --> 01:16:03,750
And what I will do!

975
01:16:07,083 --> 01:16:09,000
Yes, yes, I understood.

976
01:16:10,333 --> 01:16:13,000
Come on, start the massage.

977
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:16,833
By the way, it's Holi tomorrow.

978
01:16:17,291 --> 01:16:19,666
I'm having a prayer ceremony
to bless me with a son!

979
01:16:20,041 --> 01:16:23,583
Why don't you join us,
it might just happen!

980
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:29,333
Raja, prayers won't help you.

981
01:16:29,666 --> 01:16:32,541
Investigations about
Anarkali's murder have begun.

982
01:16:32,833 --> 01:16:35,250
And I will definitely save Chhoti.

983
01:16:35,375 --> 01:16:37,708
Leave, or do you also want a massage?

984
01:16:48,458 --> 01:16:49,583
Hey.

985
01:16:50,083 --> 01:16:51,333
Shh.

986
01:17:06,333 --> 01:17:07,625
Chhoti...

987
01:17:12,208 --> 01:17:13,458
Noor is no more.

988
01:17:20,583 --> 01:17:24,208
Some women in the Ashram
pushed her from the balcony yesterday.

989
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,583
I have unlocked all the rear doors.

990
01:18:26,666 --> 01:18:28,250
Lord Rama is the ultimate truth!

991
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:29,875
Lord Rama is the ultimate truth!

992
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,625
Lord Rama is the ultimate truth!

993
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:33,208
Lord Rama is the ultimate truth!

994
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:34,875
Lord Rama is the ultimate truth!

995
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:40,916
Wake up!

996
01:18:41,041 --> 01:18:42,041
Chhoti has escaped!

997
01:18:42,166 --> 01:18:44,125
Ashok ji, Chhoti has escaped.

998
01:19:12,958 --> 01:19:17,750
Hail the Ganges River!
Hail the Ganges River!

999
01:19:35,791 --> 01:19:39,541
No, no, whatever you say,
this Holi, I will splash color on you.

1000
01:19:39,666 --> 01:19:41,375
This is my promise to you.

1001
01:19:46,041 --> 01:19:47,791
Sir, Chhoti has escaped!

1002
01:19:50,875 --> 01:19:52,250
Hurry up, get my uniform!

1003
01:19:53,541 --> 01:19:55,625
It's a bad omen to leave
in the middle of prayers.

1004
01:19:58,625 --> 01:20:00,791
You can't handle a small girl,
you bloody eunuchs!

1005
01:20:00,916 --> 01:20:03,500
When I find her, I will shoot her!

1006
01:20:03,625 --> 01:20:04,833
Give my shirt.

1007
01:20:09,416 --> 01:20:10,541
Give the belt.

1008
01:20:11,666 --> 01:20:13,708
What are you waiting for? Run!

1009
01:20:14,541 --> 01:20:16,791
She will definitely go to Noor's funeral.
Let's go there.

1010
01:20:16,916 --> 01:20:18,500
What are you waiting for? Run!

1011
01:20:18,625 --> 01:20:19,708
Raja!

1012
01:20:20,083 --> 01:20:22,458
Do you know why
I never took a bath in Lolark Kund?

1013
01:20:23,041 --> 01:20:25,291
I didn't want to give birth
to another Raja!

1014
01:20:25,666 --> 01:20:27,083
I will deal with you when I'm back.

1015
01:20:27,208 --> 01:20:29,291
You will never see us again.

1016
01:20:29,541 --> 01:20:31,000
I will be back.

1017
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,625
Salutations to the Mother Goddess

1018
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:43,958
Hail to the power of women

1019
01:20:45,375 --> 01:20:48,958
More strength to her

1020
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:52,416
More strength to her

1021
01:20:53,208 --> 01:20:56,666
Bow to her

1022
01:24:10,958 --> 01:24:14,875
Hey, move all these things.

1023
01:24:15,708 --> 01:24:18,416
Hey girl, remove these things.

1024
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:20,000
Mind your language!

1025
01:24:20,416 --> 01:24:21,916
You are talking to Noor Saxena.

1026
01:24:22,041 --> 01:24:23,625
Senior Advocate, Supreme Court.

1027
01:24:24,208 --> 01:24:26,791
Don't teach us manners. Get it?

1028
01:24:27,083 --> 01:24:29,166
You are disrupting the peace in the city.

1029
01:24:29,291 --> 01:24:31,875
Absolutely not.
We are here only to celebrate Holi.

1030
01:24:33,083 --> 01:24:35,250
To celebrate Holi!

1031
01:24:35,916 --> 01:24:38,125
These widows are going
to play with colors?

1032
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:41,916
-Yes.
-Wow! Wonderful!

1033
01:24:42,041 --> 01:24:43,833
Today, they will play with colors...

1034
01:24:44,708 --> 01:24:46,416
tomorrow, they will adorn themselves.

1035
01:24:46,541 --> 01:24:48,166
Then they will get married as well.

1036
01:24:49,208 --> 01:24:50,666
You cannot play with colors here, madam.

1037
01:24:50,916 --> 01:24:55,333
This is a tradition of Banaras
that widows cannot celebrate Holi.

1038
01:24:55,458 --> 01:24:57,041
You can keep your traditions to yourself.

1039
01:24:57,666 --> 01:25:00,166
-Madam, here--
-Don’t you dare touch me again!

1040
01:25:04,166 --> 01:25:05,666
You are committing two crimes here!

1041
01:25:06,875 --> 01:25:10,083
First: You are violating the orders
of the Honorable Supreme Court.

1042
01:25:10,416 --> 01:25:15,500
Second: Under section 46,
class 4, criminal procedure court,

1043
01:25:15,625 --> 01:25:18,333
being a male officer,
you cannot touch a female!

1044
01:25:20,166 --> 01:25:22,083
Sir, you cannot touch her.

1045
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:32,000
-Let me see how you will play Holi.
-Yes, you can!

1046
01:25:32,125 --> 01:25:34,041
They are going to play Holi!

1047
01:25:36,041 --> 01:25:38,875
I promise to become a police officer
just to protect you.

1048
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,583
Swear by the Ganges River.

1049
01:25:42,541 --> 01:25:45,541
What? Nothing has happened. Let's go.

1050
01:28:36,541 --> 01:28:39,791
Chhoti, always remember
this one poem by Tagore.

1051
01:28:40,833 --> 01:28:46,333
'Where the mind is without fear
and the head is held high'

1052
01:29:55,208 --> 01:30:01,208
Hey Chhoti, as promised I'm back
before the prayers are over.

1053
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,291
Here are 300 rupees.

1054
01:30:03,875 --> 01:30:05,583
Want to start school from tomorrow?
