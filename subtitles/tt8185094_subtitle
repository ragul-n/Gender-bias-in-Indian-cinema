00:03:32,407 --> 00:03:33,907

4
00:03:36,365 --> 00:03:37,685

00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:46,699

00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,240
Get up

9
00:03:47,532 --> 00:03:48,532
Get up

10
00:03:48,824 --> 00:03:50,240
What dude, so early in the morning?

11
00:03:50,282 --> 00:03:50,990
Time is 9:30 dude

12
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:53,324
It would be 9:30, so what?

13
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,990
Hey, exam dude

14
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:59,824
Oh no, is it now that you say? Move

00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,199
Move dude, move on

16
00:04:14,074 --> 00:04:15,074
Hey, what happened?

17
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,699
Hey, hall ticket dude

18
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:17,949
Have you forgotten again?

19
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:19,837
Thinking that I may forget this time again

20
00:04:19,865 --> 00:04:20,782
I have given the hall ticket to sister

21
00:04:20,824 --> 00:04:22,531
She too is writing exam at this same center

22
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:23,615
You have no sense dude

23
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,883
Hey, first go and search where
she is and bring the hall ticket

24
00:04:25,907 --> 00:04:26,907
Hey, move dude

25
00:04:30,532 --> 00:04:31,157
Neha

26
00:04:31,157 --> 00:04:31,657
Hey mister

27
00:04:31,865 --> 00:04:32,407
What do you want

28
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:33,699
why are you peeping so? Out

29
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,699
Hey, where is this girl?

30
00:04:46,324 --> 00:04:47,324
Hey dude, come here?

31
00:04:48,074 --> 00:04:50,133
Why are you moving in the
corridor after the exam started?

32
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:51,157
What is your room number?

33
00:04:52,365 --> 00:04:54,325
Why are you seeing through
the window and coming?

34
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:59,574
Sir as I would forget my hall ticket gave
it to my sister and I am searching for her

35
00:05:01,365 --> 00:05:02,990
I saw you somewhere man

36
00:05:04,907 --> 00:05:06,573
Last year in Laila college

37
00:05:06,574 --> 00:05:09,534
you did not allow for exam as hall
ticket was forgotten and that was me Sir

38
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:12,069
It happened once and you did not change.
What to say?

39
00:05:12,365 --> 00:05:14,005
Why is so much of neglection about exams?

40
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,324
I kept the alarm but that did not ring

41
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,490
I too am asking the same

42
00:05:18,657 --> 00:05:20,017
what was the need to put an alarm?

43
00:05:20,074 --> 00:05:21,794
Students should automatically get up right?

44
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:23,609
Why do you not talk anything?

45
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,990
Hey you...

46
00:05:26,824 --> 00:05:28,282
I’m not knowing what to talk sir

47
00:05:28,532 --> 00:05:29,532
Not knowing?

48
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,949
None can change you in this life.
Go and search

49
00:05:35,032 --> 00:05:36,032
Neha

50
00:05:36,407 --> 00:05:36,949
Time

51
00:05:37,157 --> 00:05:37,824
Hall ticket

52
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,199
I gave it to Pavani behind you
in second block room number 2, go

53
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,824
No dear

54
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,175
I asked to keep it with you
and why did you give her

55
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,216
Who are you?
Get out
Black Pavani or Pavani behind our house?

56
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,480
Pavani behind the house Get out

57
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,490
Why not show?

58
00:06:13,282 --> 00:06:14,282
Hey big mouth...

59
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,324
You think free service?

60
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:17,615
No, I’ll give money

61
00:06:18,282 --> 00:06:19,365
Hey, ten rupees

62
00:06:20,032 --> 00:06:21,032
Madam

63
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,029
He is asking to show and
that he’ll give money madam

64
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,574
I’ll send you out if you play crazy tricks

65
00:06:28,115 --> 00:06:30,032
Write what you know, understood?

66
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,199
Did you bring slips?

67
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:33,032
No madam

68
00:06:33,074 --> 00:06:33,657
Take out the slips

69
00:06:34,074 --> 00:06:34,657
No madam

70
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:35,407
Come on take out

71
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,074
I stopped keeping slips

72
00:06:37,157 --> 00:06:39,574
I understand seeing your
face, take out the slips

73
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,199
I really stopped madam.

74
00:06:41,324 --> 00:06:42,324
You know why?

75
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:49,074
We sit whole night, write slips and bring keeping
those in the pockets, collar and underwear?

76
00:06:49,324 --> 00:06:51,282
But by the time exam start

77
00:06:51,532 --> 00:06:52,852
we used to be into sweating madam

78
00:06:52,907 --> 00:06:55,449
We were not knowing in
which place is which slip

79
00:06:55,657 --> 00:06:57,449
Thus I decided to study

80
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,490
Did you study, then?

81
00:06:58,657 --> 00:06:59,782
What to study

82
00:06:59,824 --> 00:07:01,184
I decided just in the night right?

83
00:07:01,657 --> 00:07:02,657
Idiot, sit

84
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:04,699
Silence

85
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,740
over

86
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:29,157
Show please...

87
00:07:32,324 --> 00:07:33,804
Yours and mine is the same story dear

88
00:07:43,282 --> 00:07:44,282
Daddy, coffee

89
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,170
Will your brother pass at least this time?

90
00:07:49,782 --> 00:07:51,115
Yes, he will pass dad

91
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,115
Yes, he will. He passed two in two years.

92
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:57,657
He is three years elder to you
and wrote exams with you this time

93
00:07:58,615 --> 00:08:01,574
All smaller than him have passed
and are doing jobs somewhere

94
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,824
He is shameless still here

95
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:04,824
Hey dear,

96
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,824
bring that vegetable basket here
Yes mom, coming

97
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,675
Mom, you should bring bitter
guard and bottle guard for sure

98
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:16,365
Go idiot, you eat less and ask more
- Mom please

99
00:08:16,824 --> 00:08:17,824
do not forget

100
00:08:26,782 --> 00:08:27,532
Hello, who is this?

101
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,990
Uncle, is Sagar there?

102
00:08:29,324 --> 00:08:30,949
I think Sir is not yet woken up

103
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,300
Ask him to come to the
grounds after he is up

104
00:08:32,324 --> 00:08:33,324
ok

105
00:08:34,532 --> 00:08:38,115
No education at all and again calls for your
son to come to the ground after waking up

106
00:08:45,282 --> 00:08:46,282
Hello, who is this?

107
00:08:46,324 --> 00:08:47,324
Uncle, this is Raju.

108
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:48,365
Did Sagar wake up?

109
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,907
What is the matter?

110
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,590
Ask him to urgently come to the
ground uncle, we are waiting here

111
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:56,240
if a call comes again I’ll come to
the ground and play football with all

112
00:08:56,449 --> 00:08:57,449
Cut the phone

113
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,890
Same call again asking to come
to the ground after waking up

114
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:02,032
Bloody fools!

115
00:09:02,282 --> 00:09:04,922
I think they would go breathless
without playing Cricket for a day

116
00:09:05,115 --> 00:09:08,595
Playing Cricket for the whole day and chatting
till 10 in the night sitting right there,

117
00:09:08,865 --> 00:09:11,025
what more important works
do they have in their lives?

118
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:12,199
Damn!

119
00:09:12,282 --> 00:09:14,002
None of these have the qualities to develop

120
00:09:14,407 --> 00:09:15,807
How should a guy into education be?

121
00:09:16,324 --> 00:09:21,574
A discipline, obedience, respect, dedication
to achieve something... None has it,

122
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,240
What is the nonsense early
in the morning sister?

123
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,949
Is it about us or what?

124
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,490
Not us but you

125
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:30,699
Damn!

126
00:09:30,782 --> 00:09:33,574
No discipline, no obedience and no respect

127
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,240
Do you know the spelling for a good
quality? When would you get better?

128
00:09:37,407 --> 00:09:38,407
Bad brother!

129
00:09:39,532 --> 00:09:40,115
Say what?

130
00:09:40,157 --> 00:09:41,157
Come here

131
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:42,199
I’ll tell you a secret

132
00:09:48,115 --> 00:09:50,615
You have not brushed yet, bad breathe

133
00:09:50,907 --> 00:09:52,240
Is that mouth or something else

134
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:53,324
damn it

135
00:09:53,865 --> 00:09:57,407
Will there be anybody other than you on this
earth with the qualities said by father?

136
00:09:57,449 --> 00:10:00,615
Of course, that is very
difficult brother Why not...

137
00:10:00,657 --> 00:10:02,865
If you find, say me and we
shall felicitate him grand

138
00:10:13,324 --> 00:10:14,924
What are the calls early in the morning?

139
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,490
Dad, I am going for combined studies

140
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:19,324
Combined studies?

141
00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:34,282
Hey bro

142
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,090
you studied in Vivekananda school right?

143
00:10:36,157 --> 00:10:36,740
Yes

144
00:10:36,865 --> 00:10:38,740
I am your junior bro. You identified great

145
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:43,824
Yes, I identified you and there was a
mathematics teacher short and bald headed

146
00:10:43,865 --> 00:10:44,865
Yes, Rami Reddy Sir

147
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,560
He used to hit you bad and I
was feeling very sad for that

148
00:10:47,907 --> 00:10:53,782
Ok but they used to daily call you
in the prayer and were giving cups

149
00:10:53,824 --> 00:10:56,699
soap boxes and all saying
quiz and all right?

150
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,449
Were they of any use in life?

151
00:10:59,282 --> 00:11:01,449
I know, they are of no use
and thus I did not study

152
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:04,574
Ok, I asked you a doubt in
childhood and do you remember that?

153
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:07,074
Sravan

154
00:11:07,324 --> 00:11:08,074
What bro?

155
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:10,949
I always wish to play well, watch movies...

156
00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:13,329
Hey, throw the ball dude
And wish to enjoy great

157
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:17,074
but you always are into studying.
Won’t you feel to be happy like us?

158
00:11:17,324 --> 00:11:21,824
I feel but watching movies, playing
are all temporary pleasures it seems

159
00:11:22,032 --> 00:11:26,032
I’ll succeed IIT in
future and settle in life

160
00:11:26,365 --> 00:11:29,490
My dad said that I’ll get a
permanent pleasure then in life

161
00:11:29,907 --> 00:11:33,240
So, no problem losing all
such small pleasures for that

162
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,782
You have been very inspiring
for me from childhood bro

163
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:45,032
From next time when the bike stops, don’t do
anything than to raise the accelerator, ok?

164
00:11:45,074 --> 00:11:45,699
Ok

165
00:11:45,782 --> 00:11:47,199
Ok, what are you doing now?

166
00:11:47,282 --> 00:11:49,240
I got the seat in IIT and studying in NIT

167
00:11:49,282 --> 00:11:52,074
Oh no, IIT? You are super bro

168
00:11:52,115 --> 00:11:53,407
Campus selections are on now
Okay

169
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:55,489
If I get selected in that,
it’s directly a job Super

170
00:11:55,532 --> 00:11:57,282
Ok then bye... Go carefully,
Ok bro

171
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,490
Saibaba,

172
00:12:05,532 --> 00:12:07,115
you are like my uncle

173
00:12:07,365 --> 00:12:11,449
Why not make our Sagar pass in first class
and let your eldership stand high, my God?

174
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,699
Look God, may be you feel this
comedy but I am very serious here

175
00:12:16,824 --> 00:12:19,824
Even if not first class,
let him at least pass my God

176
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:23,990
If you make him pass,
I’ll come to Shirdi by walk

177
00:12:24,032 --> 00:12:25,782
and visit you

178
00:12:25,824 --> 00:12:29,157
Mom do not commit in a hurry. That is one
thousand Kilometers far, think about that

179
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:32,532
Thousand Kilometers?
He should pass, right?

180
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,490
He is still sleeping

181
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:37,657
Wake up brother

182
00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:38,532

Invigilators surprised

A student’s request to pass the exam...

00:22:10,556 --> 00:22:13,056
Why are you shouting so
at a son who is passed?

341
00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:15,139
Why not you read wearing
your spectacles hubby?

342

344
00:22:22,264 --> 00:22:24,222
My dad is dad just for name sake

345
00:22:25,681 --> 00:22:27,931
Dad used to daily drink

346
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:32,139
come home and beat mom in the night

347
00:22:39,597 --> 00:22:42,806
I studying with concentration in the
next room used to hear those screams

348
00:22:42,972 --> 00:22:45,639
Still, I used to control the
mind and study one more page

349
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,164
I could listen to the screams again

350
00:22:47,306 --> 00:22:50,139
How to study listening to the
screams of mother like that Sir?

351

That all highly educated

352

When all my teachers in childhood were saying
used to study under the street lights,

353
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:56,799
I was surprised thinking why?

354
00:22:56,931 --> 00:23:00,306
I understood now and started to sit
under the street light and study

355
00:23:00,597 --> 00:23:03,056
Current used to go after I read one page

356
00:23:03,306 --> 00:23:05,264
Three hours of power cut daily in the night

357
00:23:05,514 --> 00:23:07,056
Two pages read in the house

358
00:23:07,222 --> 00:23:08,942
and one page studied under the street light

359
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:11,764
this three pages reading is
making me fail from three years

360
00:23:12,222 --> 00:23:15,014
Please pass me if you
feel my problem serious

361
00:23:21,097 --> 00:23:23,431
If required I will marry
your daughter without dowry

362
00:23:23,972 --> 00:23:25,806
Please... Yours...

363
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:31,597
Rudraraju Sagar son of Rudraraju Deviprasad

364
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:45,014

the paper stated as a strange answer sheet

368
00:23:57,931 --> 00:24:00,851
I couldn’t notice till I saw the surname
that it was our fellow writing it

369
00:24:10,306 --> 00:24:11,386
It seems he will go to Ooty

370
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:15,722
Give him 10000 and send

Your love is never ending

387
00:26:10,056 --> 00:26:10,847
Happy birthday son

388
00:26:10,889 --> 00:26:18,472
Hey tide overflowing from the
sea and never understood book

389
00:26:19,597 --> 00:26:25,639
You stood still in the mind, hey shore

390
00:26:26,972 --> 00:26:34,847
Hey heart unreachable to the hands
Hey song of golden dreams

391
00:26:35,181 --> 00:26:41,806
Hey form of the hopes unreachable

392
00:26:42,972 --> 00:26:50,972
A load on the heart is filled
What happened? What happened son?

393
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:57,639
It travelled like a boat within me

394
00:26:58,931 --> 00:27:05,139
The eye full of water ready to rain

395
00:27:07,056 --> 00:27:13,264
That would shower from the skies

396
00:27:16,056 --> 00:27:20,722
It’s done dear, it’s over... Hey my dear...

397
00:27:26,014 --> 00:27:28,306
Hey, you know how lucky you are?

398
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:32,056
Your dad likes you more than us all

399
00:27:43,889 --> 00:27:45,056
What is wrong?

400
00:27:48,347 --> 00:27:50,139
I’m not liking myself

401
00:27:51,222 --> 00:27:53,806
What are you not liking?

402
00:27:55,931 --> 00:27:59,764
Say brother
I’m not feeling to be like me

403
00:28:06,639 --> 00:28:08,972
Brother, what happened?

404
00:28:40,764 --> 00:28:42,889
Mom, say urgently where is brother

405
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:44,157
What are you doing so much of hurry?

406
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:45,097
I got to tell a great news to brother

407
00:28:45,139 --> 00:28:47,259
He would be somewhere there, go and see
Ok, I will see

408
00:28:47,681 --> 00:28:49,222
Brother, one surprise news for you

409
00:28:49,722 --> 00:28:52,722
I saw a girl with the qualities
said by dad in the College today

410
00:28:53,056 --> 00:28:54,056
Her name is Dharmika.

411
00:28:54,514 --> 00:28:58,722
She was in Balaji colony before and has now
shifted in to house of Laxman uncle for rent

412
00:28:59,306 --> 00:29:04,347
Why are you silent, do it now. You said to felicitate if
you find a girl with the qualities said by dad, right?

413
00:29:05,139 --> 00:29:06,431
Why are you silent?

414
00:29:07,389 --> 00:29:10,556
This guys is always the
same, painful brother

415
00:29:21,764 --> 00:29:24,014
Brother, I said right Dharmika.
It’s that girl.

416
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:25,764
Ok bye

417
00:29:56,181 --> 00:29:58,639
Hello, I got to tell you a word
Useless fellow

418
00:29:58,889 --> 00:29:59,931
Hey please

419
00:30:00,264 --> 00:30:01,014

420
00:30:01,056 --> 00:30:02,431

424
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:24,722

No, will come tomorrow and say

427
00:30:46,514 --> 00:30:47,597
What’s your problem?

428
00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:49,514
Life matter right

429
00:30:49,972 --> 00:30:52,306
give me ten minutes please

430
00:30:59,056 --> 00:31:00,681
I thought not to give time to you at all

431
00:31:01,097 --> 00:31:03,389
I felt pity and said ok

432
00:31:03,681 --> 00:31:05,556
In basic, I’m not a girl like all

433
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:08,139
Not like saying about me

434
00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:14,222
but all knowing me say Dharmika is a name
for Discipline and form of obedience.

435
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:17,556
And me as such,
a guy representing idiots coming and...

436
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:19,889
Oh God

437
00:31:20,972 --> 00:31:23,764
Ok say now and I’ll listen.
I’ll see how you say

438
00:31:23,972 --> 00:31:26,514
What am I wishing to say
and what you think...

439
00:31:26,681 --> 00:31:27,597
What else would you say?

440
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:28,681
I like you

441
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:29,764
I can’t be without you

442
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:30,431
I love you...

443
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,352
there would be film
dialogues like these right?

444
00:31:34,181 --> 00:31:35,181
Hey

445
00:31:35,306 --> 00:31:36,306
why are you laughing?

446
00:31:42,764 --> 00:31:44,514
Actually I’m not liking me

447
00:31:45,264 --> 00:31:46,889
and I don’t feel like to be as myself

448
00:31:47,931 --> 00:31:49,556
I am hating my own self

449
00:31:50,722 --> 00:31:52,681
and feeling to be like someone else

450
00:31:55,014 --> 00:32:01,139
My dad always says, those studying should have
the qualities of discipline, respect and obe...

451
00:32:01,181 --> 00:32:01,806
Obedience...

452
00:32:01,847 --> 00:32:03,056
Yes, the same

453
00:32:03,181 --> 00:32:04,981
How can someone without
all those get studies

454
00:32:06,181 --> 00:32:08,181
and I wish to change as my dad likes

455
00:32:09,097 --> 00:32:10,597
To say in a way

456
00:32:11,222 --> 00:32:12,782
I want to become like you Miss Dharmika

457
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:17,222
You want to become like me?

458
00:32:17,347 --> 00:32:19,722
So, you are taking me as
your role model right?

459
00:32:22,264 --> 00:32:23,264
Good

460
00:32:24,097 --> 00:32:25,681
why not say that before itself?

461
00:32:25,889 --> 00:32:27,139
Why so much fear for that?

462
00:32:28,472 --> 00:32:29,472
I understood,

463
00:32:29,806 --> 00:32:32,097
you are suffering from
self degraded feeling

464
00:32:32,931 --> 00:32:36,514
Hey, this is not any blood
or mouth cancer right?

465
00:32:36,681 --> 00:32:37,806
It is bigger than those

466
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:40,097
What’s your name, Sagar right?

467
00:32:40,181 --> 00:32:42,014
Yes, Rudraraju Sagar

468
00:32:42,306 --> 00:32:43,139
Look Sagar

469
00:32:43,306 --> 00:32:47,847
it’s not like something great but I’ll have a
satisfaction in changing waste fellows like you

470
00:32:48,181 --> 00:32:50,389
It’s my responsibility to
change you from tomorrow

471
00:32:50,847 --> 00:32:51,264
ok

472
00:32:51,431 --> 00:32:52,431
Ok

473
00:32:52,514 --> 00:32:54,764
There is an unused lab in the
third floor of our College

474
00:32:55,347 --> 00:32:57,222
You’ll have classes
there from tomorrow - Ok

475
00:32:57,431 --> 00:32:59,722
Come there sharp by evening 5, ok?

476
00:33:00,014 --> 00:33:01,014
Ok...

477
00:33:11,472 --> 00:33:12,472
Discipline

478
00:33:12,556 --> 00:33:13,556
yes

479
00:33:13,764 --> 00:33:14,764
hello

480
00:33:14,889 --> 00:33:15,472
what happen

481
00:33:15,889 --> 00:33:18,157
Hey what, why did you open up your
mouth like that when I said discipline?

482
00:33:18,181 --> 00:33:19,556
You think this is any cake?

483
00:33:19,972 --> 00:33:23,514
This word discipline is been haunting
me like a devil from childhood

484
00:33:23,764 --> 00:33:24,764
Now,

485
00:33:24,889 --> 00:33:29,014
discipline is to do every work in time

486
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:30,264
Wow, super point

487
00:33:30,389 --> 00:33:32,681
That means you should have a time table

488
00:33:43,222 --> 00:33:44,431
Who is put that alarm?

489
00:33:45,306 --> 00:33:46,306
Did Neha put that?

490
00:33:46,847 --> 00:33:48,556
Sound is coming from Sagar’s room right?

491
00:33:48,806 --> 00:33:50,389
Where did he put the alarm?

492
00:33:52,347 --> 00:33:55,472
Hey Subbarao, get up

493
00:33:55,847 --> 00:33:57,097
Where did you put the alarm?

494
00:33:57,764 --> 00:33:58,931
Who kept the alarm?

495
00:33:59,931 --> 00:34:01,056
Me dad

496
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:04,764
So early in the morning, why?
To study

497
00:34:05,222 --> 00:34:06,556
Study and you...

498
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:12,556
What son, any new film release?

499
00:34:12,597 --> 00:34:14,639
What films, should I not study?

500
00:34:14,681 --> 00:34:17,139
Come on, what is you studying
like some comedy son?

501
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,722
Are you my mother?
Should I not develop, come up? go

502
00:34:22,972 --> 00:34:25,431
Hey, I know about you

503
00:34:25,472 --> 00:34:28,472
Cover the bed sheet and sleep till
10:30 without doing over actions, sleep

504
00:34:28,556 --> 00:34:33,222
What’s me doing over action, it’s you doing
over action in the kitchen. You rabbit go...

505
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:43,615
Just 50 Rupees cash back on the
first Pay TM transaction on UPA

506
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:46,097
Hey rascal, what are those TV
sounds early in the morning?

507
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:48,181
Hey, SA..RI..GA..MA..PA..

508
00:34:51,306 --> 00:34:52,639
Mathematics...

509
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:03,139
Bathing! Oh man,
it’s already 10 seconds late

510
00:35:06,347 --> 00:35:07,347
hey neha

511
00:35:08,389 --> 00:35:08,972
go

512
00:35:09,014 --> 00:35:09,639
Get up

513
00:35:09,806 --> 00:35:10,806
I have a doubt

514
00:35:11,389 --> 00:35:12,389
what

515
00:35:12,597 --> 00:35:13,597
a doubt for you?

516
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:14,681
What is that?

517
00:35:14,764 --> 00:35:16,806
What is this like an insect?

518
00:35:21,764 --> 00:35:24,847
That is not an insect but Stigma.
You’ll know if you ever read

519
00:35:25,014 --> 00:35:25,889
Oh Stigma!

520
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:29,639
Don’t disturb me again with your
waste doubts. Ask those after I get up, ok?

521
00:35:30,431 --> 00:35:32,306
You, dirty monkey rascal!

522
00:35:32,472 --> 00:35:35,264
Still, what work do these
alphabets have in mathematics?

523
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:44,014
Yesterday’s show was a
disaster, utter flop!

524
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:47,264
Hey, are you still getting sleep?

525
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:50,347
Oh no, you still don’t
know completely about me

526
00:35:50,597 --> 00:35:52,597
When I sleep at home,
I don’t wake up for two days

527
00:35:52,931 --> 00:35:55,139
You know what were all my
friends calling me in school?

528
00:35:55,431 --> 00:35:56,931
They used to call me Rip Van Winkle

529
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:57,972
More?

530
00:35:58,181 --> 00:35:58,764
More?

531
00:35:59,097 --> 00:36:04,264
Cricket, movies, friends...
I do anything for these

532
00:36:05,389 --> 00:36:06,389
Now...

533
00:36:09,722 --> 00:36:11,847

Look Sagar, for a person to ruin and
become like you, major virus is friends

536
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,639
A guy like you should be said practically

537
00:36:24,681 --> 00:36:26,597
Whose is this family photo?

538
00:36:26,889 --> 00:36:27,889
This is

539
00:36:28,014 --> 00:36:29,014
Hey, no extras...

540
00:36:29,347 --> 00:36:34,472
Now, the human is kept changing
and came till here from here

541
00:36:34,556 --> 00:36:37,181
But you are still here

542
00:36:39,097 --> 00:36:40,389
If I am here

543
00:36:40,556 --> 00:36:43,139
where would all my friends be? Idiots!

544
00:36:43,181 --> 00:36:44,661
I’ll cut... I’ll immediately cut them

545
00:36:44,722 --> 00:36:45,806

00:36:57,264 --> 00:36:58,931
Hey, you all should excuse me

00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:01,889
No Cricket,
no movies and no enjoyment from now

553
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:05,097
To say straight without a nuisance,
we are getting separated now

554
00:37:05,472 --> 00:37:07,889
I’ve taken this step to change for dad

555
00:37:07,972 --> 00:37:10,139
Do not think to meet me again in life guys

556
00:37:10,222 --> 00:37:11,889
because I’m going to develop a lot

557
00:37:11,931 --> 00:37:12,847

558
00:37:12,889 --> 00:37:13,889
hey sagar

559
00:37:15,307 --> 00:37:16,141
Miss Dharmika

560
00:37:16,266 --> 00:37:21,474
it’s like I’m half changed because I’m one by one following
all the steps you said. I’ve just left out my idiots too

561
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:24,057
Why are you so excited so fast?

562
00:37:24,391 --> 00:37:27,349
There’s still a lots of syllabus
and you’ll know going ahead

563
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:32,849
Ok, you have the habit of reading books?

564
00:37:32,932 --> 00:37:34,307
Oh, I read so many

565
00:37:34,641 --> 00:37:35,182
Oh no

566
00:37:35,432 --> 00:37:37,807
you too have the habit of reading books?
- Yes, I read

567
00:37:38,224 --> 00:37:39,224
What books do you read?

568
00:37:39,682 --> 00:37:43,349
Swathi, Abhisarika, Chitramalini, Santo...
- Shut up

569
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:46,974
I’m not asking about such books

570
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,974
but about books that are helpful for life

571
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:51,974
Oh, then I’ve read only
one book from my childhood

572
00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:53,659
The tables book from Venkataramana & Co

573
00:37:53,807 --> 00:37:58,516
You know what, if you ask me
right away I cannot even say table 2...

574
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:02,099
Move on

575
00:38:11,307 --> 00:38:13,807
Yes... Five steps to success

576
00:38:14,057 --> 00:38:15,266
Six steps to success

577
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:16,849
Success in your hands

578
00:38:17,224 --> 00:38:18,432
Success is yours...

579
00:38:18,849 --> 00:38:22,432
Self confidence or.... Yes...

580
00:38:22,641 --> 00:38:25,016
Hey, what happened? - Miss Dharmika...

581
00:38:25,391 --> 00:38:27,516
You have come into my
life really like a Goddess

582
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:31,724
My eyes are seeing the books
helpful in life for the first time

583
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:35,557
I’m feeling like to read
all these books at once

584
00:38:36,557 --> 00:38:37,766
This is the problem with you.

585
00:38:37,891 --> 00:38:39,099
Do not read whatever you see

586
00:38:39,182 --> 00:38:42,599
I’ll say what to follow in
those and what not to follow

587
00:38:43,057 --> 00:38:44,432
Understood? - Yes, understood

588
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:50,432
Wow, yes! New book of Ram D
Sekhar, I’m so lucky

589
00:38:51,474 --> 00:38:51,891
Excuse me

590
00:38:52,141 --> 00:38:54,641
has the book How to earn
money from CV Rao sir come?

591
00:38:54,682 --> 00:38:57,762
He did not publish as Sir does not have
the money and it takes two more months

592
00:38:58,557 --> 00:39:01,266
Miss Dharmika,
shall we take any books even for me?

593
00:39:01,516 --> 00:39:02,266
No need

594
00:39:02,474 --> 00:39:04,516
come to my house and take - Ok move on

595
00:39:08,432 --> 00:39:12,641
Oh no, so many cups,
so many prizes and so many shields

596
00:39:12,891 --> 00:39:15,307
Miss Dharmika,
are you even a child prodigy?

597
00:39:15,516 --> 00:39:21,349
Not once, I was the child
prodigy from 1999 to 2004

598
00:39:22,641 --> 00:39:26,266
If I too was a child prodigy,
my dad would have been very happy

599
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:28,724
It should be in the fate for everything

600
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:36,016
Hello, saying not in fate, my bad luck, my stars
are bad are all the words from the losers

601
00:39:36,224 --> 00:39:38,144
Then what are the words
from the winners, madam?

602
00:39:38,682 --> 00:39:46,099
I will achieve, yes I can, I have never ending
power, I have the power, I am the winner...

603
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:50,266
Wow, it is so great. My hairs are
going stiff when you are saying

604
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:53,182
You are talking so rhythmic
like a father in the church

605
00:39:53,807 --> 00:39:55,099
Still, all these are not my own

606
00:39:55,474 --> 00:39:57,599
but written by my favorite
write Ram V Sekhar

607
00:39:59,057 --> 00:40:00,266
I think it’s five years back

608
00:40:00,474 --> 00:40:04,266
a girl committed suicide for
not getting his book in Warangal

609
00:40:04,932 --> 00:40:06,349
He’s become more famous from then

610
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:09,099
Here are the books of Ram V Sekhar

611
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:10,557
Take them and read

612
00:40:10,682 --> 00:40:12,807
He will introduce yourself new to you

613
00:40:13,141 --> 00:40:16,349
He’ll pull out that great power within you

614
00:40:16,557 --> 00:40:17,557
ok

615
00:40:17,932 --> 00:40:18,932
Thanks

616
00:40:49,474 --> 00:40:51,016
Brother, please give me that bat

617
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:52,891
Yes, I got the bat

618
00:41:35,724 --> 00:41:37,391
Mom, give me 4000

619
00:41:37,557 --> 00:41:39,307
4000, for what?

620
00:41:39,932 --> 00:41:42,349
That is... There is a great
man named Ram V Sekhar

621
00:41:42,432 --> 00:41:45,099
He gives personality development
classes and I wanted to join those

622
00:41:45,141 --> 00:41:47,516
Personality development? - Yes
What is that son?

623
00:41:48,224 --> 00:41:49,849
Oh no, how do I say you mom...

624
00:41:49,891 --> 00:41:51,766
Yes, dad always says right?

625
00:41:51,807 --> 00:41:56,391
Discipline, sincerity and obe...
Obedience yes that

626
00:41:56,432 --> 00:41:57,724
How do all these come

627
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:02,307
how should they be and he teaches
how to get better in life, mom

628
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:04,932
Are they giving classes even to get better?
- Yes

629
00:42:05,057 --> 00:42:06,766
Still, the rate is very high right?

630
00:42:06,932 --> 00:42:08,182
I’ll give 200, take it

631
00:42:08,307 --> 00:42:10,849
You think this is any
of your tailoring class?

632
00:42:10,891 --> 00:42:12,158
It’s personality development class mom

633
00:42:12,182 --> 00:42:13,182
Leave it son

634
00:42:13,224 --> 00:42:15,016
what do I know about his business?

635
00:42:15,057 --> 00:42:16,974
I have one thousand, take it and give him

636
00:42:17,016 --> 00:42:19,432
I need 3000 more mom,
arrange somehow please

637
00:42:19,474 --> 00:42:20,974
I will get from your dad and give

638
00:42:21,016 --> 00:42:22,349
Thanks mom, thanks

639
00:42:25,182 --> 00:42:27,141
Money will be in the almirah
inside, go and take

640
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:29,599
Hey

641
00:42:30,057 --> 00:42:32,307
Take 500 more,
it would be for your expenses

642
00:42:33,891 --> 00:42:34,891
ok dad

643
00:42:45,141 --> 00:42:48,224
Hey, great change has
come these days in Sagar

644
00:42:48,932 --> 00:42:50,891
Sagar before and Sagar
now are different - Oh

645
00:42:51,224 --> 00:42:53,807
Our Ram V Sekhar is there right? - Who?

646
00:42:54,016 --> 00:42:57,474
I mean, he takes these personality
development classes and all - Yes

647
00:42:57,516 --> 00:42:58,807
He is reading his books too

648
00:42:59,516 --> 00:43:03,099
He was going around for movies
and roaming around right? - Yes

649
00:43:03,224 --> 00:43:06,224
Now, he is sitting with books
from the morning - Super

650
00:43:06,766 --> 00:43:08,474
I feel very happy now seeing him

651
00:43:09,557 --> 00:43:13,141
Ok, why not come home taking
some time? We can have a good chat - Sure

652
00:43:13,474 --> 00:43:14,557
See you dude - Ok

653
00:43:32,432 --> 00:43:35,516
Did you read the latest
book of Ram V Sekhar

654
00:43:35,724 --> 00:43:39,141
I didn’t read full but read
till the”Aimed arrow” chapter

655
00:43:39,432 --> 00:43:42,641
Yes, there is another chapter
after that named “Path fixing”

656
00:43:42,849 --> 00:43:46,599
That would be extra ordinary
I read it daily to him

657
00:43:46,766 --> 00:43:49,349
Yes sister, I like that chapter a lot

658
00:43:49,807 --> 00:43:51,224
If I had come here in his age

659
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:52,682
I would’ve been elsewhere

660
00:43:52,849 --> 00:43:53,599
Hey brother

661
00:43:53,724 --> 00:43:55,599
are you fine? - Hi, I am fine

662
00:43:55,641 --> 00:43:58,432
You think I would get any
better coming to this class?

663
00:43:58,474 --> 00:43:59,754
There would be a result for sure

664
00:43:59,891 --> 00:44:01,932
If we follow his ideology correctly

665
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:03,307
it’s like we reached our goal

666
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,474
Many thanks brother

667
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:06,599
Dharmika, he is Sravan
and a great prodigy like

668
00:44:06,641 --> 00:44:07,641
Hello.. hi

669
00:44:08,307 --> 00:44:10,891
All of you be silent

670
00:44:11,432 --> 00:44:13,724
The great, Ram V Sekhar is arrived

671
00:44:13,891 --> 00:44:16,432
He is going to come on to
this dais within 2 minutes

672
00:44:16,516 --> 00:44:19,016
All of you be alert, be active

673
00:44:31,766 --> 00:44:32,974
Good evening everybody

674
00:44:33,141 --> 00:44:34,557
Good evening Sir

675
00:44:35,432 --> 00:44:38,766
The person without a
goal is equal to a donkey

676
00:44:39,974 --> 00:44:47,766
When a guy with goal works for his goal the
person with no goal works for the guy with a goal

677
00:44:48,141 --> 00:44:51,016
That means when the guy
with goal becomes a Doctor

678
00:44:51,307 --> 00:44:56,724
the guy without goal works
like a donkey as his peon

679
00:44:57,307 --> 00:45:02,182
Say now, all of you here have
some or the other goal or not?

680
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:03,724
Yes, we have

681
00:45:03,974 --> 00:45:09,182
Say loud and with love
We have a goal, we have a goal

682
00:45:09,266 --> 00:45:14,224
Say again and with love
We have a goal, we have a goal

683
00:45:14,516 --> 00:45:17,599
Then, in how many days
can you reach that goal?

684
00:45:17,974 --> 00:45:19,016
Do you know?

685
00:45:19,099 --> 00:45:20,141
No

686
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:22,599
Don’t know?

687
00:45:22,974 --> 00:45:27,766
I’ll let you know in how many
days can you reach your goal

688
00:45:27,932 --> 00:45:28,932
Any body...

689
00:45:32,224 --> 00:45:33,432
Oh, come on!

690
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:35,141
Yes clap, clap...

691
00:45:35,557 --> 00:45:37,682
clap... Very good...

692
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:39,599
Please come...

693
00:45:41,391 --> 00:45:43,557
Good, be seated

694
00:45:45,891 --> 00:45:48,141
What is your name dear? - Sagar

695
00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:50,974
Sagar, what is your goal?

696
00:45:52,057 --> 00:45:54,391
My goal is to change as my dad, Sir - What?

697
00:45:59,016 --> 00:46:01,099
You wish to become as your dad likes

698
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:01,891
Yes Sir

699
00:46:02,057 --> 00:46:04,599
I’ll now put ten questions to you. - Ok sir

700
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:05,849
Question number one...

701
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:10,682
It rained and all roads
are flowing with water.

702
00:46:11,182 --> 00:46:14,599
You were going on that roadside
and a car went fast on that road

703
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:17,766
Water squashed and your
white shirt got spoilt.

704
00:46:17,891 --> 00:46:19,224
Then, your reactions

705
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:22,516
A.. I’ll throw stone
screaming, you dirty idiot

706
00:46:22,891 --> 00:46:27,682
B.. I’ll sit there and cry thinking
the time is bad and today is not favoring

707
00:46:27,891 --> 00:46:32,349
C.. I’ll think should not wear white shirt
in rainy season and come on to the roads

708
00:46:32,391 --> 00:46:38,516
D.. As this society will never change, I’ll
wear that white shirt as it as and come

709
00:46:39,141 --> 00:46:41,932
What is your option
from these four options?

710
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,557
Obviously option A Sir

711
00:46:52,766 --> 00:46:54,891
- You would throw a stone
saying you dirty rascal

712
00:46:55,099 --> 00:46:56,099
Yes sir, it is so

713
00:46:56,349 --> 00:46:57,349
Question number 2

714
00:46:59,307 --> 00:47:02,474
You’ve been waiting for the train.
It’s already an hour.

715
00:47:02,641 --> 00:47:04,700
You asked the guy adjacent as
to when would the train come

716
00:47:04,724 --> 00:47:07,099
He said it would take two more hours.

717
00:47:07,557 --> 00:47:08,599
What’ll you do then?

718
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:12,307
A.. I’ll go to a film as
still there is two hours

719
00:47:12,516 --> 00:47:17,182
B.. I scold Railway department
people filthily and go home

720
00:47:17,307 --> 00:47:21,891
Option C, there is a book shop beside and will
read buying personality development books

721
00:47:22,057 --> 00:47:24,766
Option D,
I keep playing games on cell phone

722
00:47:28,224 --> 00:47:29,891
I have two options sir, A and D

723
00:47:30,516 --> 00:47:32,141
You’ll go to a film - Yes Sir

724
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,766
If not keep playing games - Yes sir

725
00:47:34,099 --> 00:47:35,391
Ok? - Ok sir

726
00:47:36,682 --> 00:47:37,682
Mr. Sagar

727
00:47:38,766 --> 00:47:40,182
No need of 10 questions for you

728
00:47:41,182 --> 00:47:42,182
two are enough

729
00:47:42,724 --> 00:47:44,016
Even two are not needed

730
00:47:44,432 --> 00:47:45,557
the first one was enough

731
00:47:46,307 --> 00:47:47,307
Look man

732
00:47:48,141 --> 00:47:52,057
if you throw a stone screaming
you dirty rascal what will happen?

733
00:47:52,557 --> 00:47:58,266
He will stop the car and come down from the
car. You both fight and scold each other

734
00:47:58,391 --> 00:47:59,391
What will happen?

735
00:47:59,432 --> 00:48:00,641
It becomes a dirty mess

736
00:48:01,016 --> 00:48:03,141
Think positively, you are an youngster

737
00:48:03,474 --> 00:48:06,474
You’ll come up in life only
if you think very positive

738
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:07,599
Understand?

739
00:48:10,766 --> 00:48:13,141
It’s very tough for guys
like you thinking negatively

740
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,974
You know what’s the answer
of the person reaching goals?

741
00:48:16,391 --> 00:48:19,682
C, the person choosing C
option will reach the goal.

742
00:48:20,224 --> 00:48:22,474
How many are from you choosing C?

743
00:48:27,182 --> 00:48:30,224
Oh, total! Very good, bring the hands down

744
00:48:32,057 --> 00:48:35,641
Look, it’s two hours of time
waste going to a film dear

745
00:48:36,266 --> 00:48:38,932
It’s further waste to
play games on cell phone

746
00:48:39,099 --> 00:48:40,141
And you are very waste.

747
00:48:42,307 --> 00:48:43,307
You are unfit.

748
00:48:45,266 --> 00:48:48,557
You cannot reach the goal of your
father, you cannot

749
00:49:15,307 --> 00:49:16,516
Why are you feeling so much?

750
00:49:21,766 --> 00:49:23,182
I like my daddy very much

751
00:49:24,432 --> 00:49:26,474
Even my dad liked me a lot in my childhood

752
00:49:27,266 --> 00:49:31,057
But when I started going to
school, exams have started.

753
00:49:31,724 --> 00:49:34,766
Immediately the results and all were zeroes

754
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:39,599
Those marks used to come
as a devil blocking me and my dad

755
00:49:40,474 --> 00:49:42,057
You know what happened once

756
00:49:42,474 --> 00:49:46,016
My dad took me out to
teach cycling as a kid

757
00:49:46,724 --> 00:49:47,724
Take left, left... Yes...

758
00:49:49,891 --> 00:49:51,099
Yes, super...

759
00:49:55,974 --> 00:49:58,266
Sir, hello
Hello Mr. Rami Reddy

760
00:49:58,307 --> 00:49:59,641
Why are you sitting here?

761
00:49:59,891 --> 00:50:01,516
I’m teaching my son to cycle

762
00:50:01,807 --> 00:50:06,057
You can teach cycling to your son later
but teach him Mathematics tables first Sir

763
00:50:06,307 --> 00:50:08,766
Has he said his marks
from second unit test?

764
00:50:09,224 --> 00:50:12,266
Zero! What are you and what is this zero?

765
00:50:12,891 --> 00:50:16,891
I feel ashamed Sir, concentrate
a bit on studies of your son Sir

766
00:50:16,974 --> 00:50:20,516
When my Mathematics teacher that day
said that I am very weak in studies

767
00:50:21,182 --> 00:50:22,849
my dad felt very insulted

768
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:27,849
daddy

769
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:30,599
Daddy, I got it.

770
00:50:32,141 --> 00:50:33,141
Daddy

771
00:50:34,307 --> 00:50:35,641
Daddy, I got it.

772
00:50:44,016 --> 00:50:45,807
He didn’t care even when I fell down.

773
00:50:46,432 --> 00:50:47,891
From then till now,

774
00:50:48,682 --> 00:50:50,641
I’ve been trying to get close to him

775
00:50:52,766 --> 00:50:55,182
Just now those questions and answers

776
00:50:55,391 --> 00:50:58,807
when I was said cannot do what I wished...

777
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:03,307
My whole mind went upset. I didn’t understand
anything Everything seems confused and shabby

778
00:51:52,432 --> 00:51:53,516
Huh Sagar

779
00:51:53,557 --> 00:51:54,099
sagar

780
00:51:54,516 --> 00:51:55,432
Who is Sagar?

781
00:51:55,474 --> 00:51:56,224
What happened to you?

782
00:51:56,307 --> 00:51:57,932
Nothing sister

783
00:51:58,224 --> 00:52:00,766
I’m reading the paper and said so in a flow

784
00:52:01,932 --> 00:52:03,724
I transferred the money, check once

785
00:52:04,682 --> 00:52:07,307
Ok sister, ok

786
00:52:09,724 --> 00:52:10,891
Ok sister good night

787
00:52:16,391 --> 00:52:22,432
Cot A+B equal to SAGAR...

788
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:41,307
To control your feelings, draw a circle
stand in between and repeat up to ten times

789
00:52:41,349 --> 00:52:47,391
I should not fall in love with Sagar...

790
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:52,099
If your feelings are still not controlled,
you should write ten times imposition

791
00:52:52,766 --> 00:52:55,141
Huh... Not 10 but I’ll write times...

792
00:52:55,641 --> 00:53:00,391
I should not fall in love with Sagar...

793
00:53:02,307 --> 00:53:03,307
yes

794
00:53:04,557 --> 00:53:05,807
Yes, 100 times finish...

795
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:29,932
Something happened...
Something unknown is happening

796
00:53:30,057 --> 00:53:37,891
Something happened...
Something never experienced is happening

797
00:53:38,474 --> 00:53:45,891
I feel cold in the burning sun
I am sweating in the cool weather

798
00:53:46,474 --> 00:53:53,432
A rain has started in the heart
I feel like my life is going

799
00:53:54,016 --> 00:54:02,016
My age is given a sweet wound
Love has called me loud

800
00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:10,099
What is this greed and what is this love?
It’s a thirst unfilled drinking up the sea

801
00:54:10,141 --> 00:54:17,932
Something happened...
Something unknown is happening

802
00:54:18,057 --> 00:54:25,932
Something happened...
Something never experienced is happening

803
00:54:25,974 --> 00:54:27,724
Two... - I should change like my dad likes

804
00:54:27,766 --> 00:54:29,242
Three...
- I should change like my dad likes

805
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,986
Four... - I should change like my dad likes

806
00:54:31,016 --> 00:54:32,533
Five... - I should change like my dad likes

807
00:54:32,557 --> 00:54:34,117
Six... - I should change like my dad likes

808
00:54:34,141 --> 00:54:36,516
Seven, eight, nine and ten...
It’s over brother, enough now

809
00:54:36,557 --> 00:54:38,242
Please ten more times - How
much more time brother, please?

810
00:54:38,266 --> 00:54:40,099
Eleven...
- I should change like my dad likes

811
00:54:44,016 --> 00:54:46,599
What is this son,
writing so for so many times?

812
00:54:46,932 --> 00:54:48,932
Have you seen your face, how it is become?

813
00:54:48,974 --> 00:54:53,432
I should work hard, right mom? How if I don’t work
hard? Is it any easy to change like how dad likes?

814
00:54:58,182 --> 00:55:05,807
Like the groups of birds
reaching the eyes having dreams

815
00:55:05,849 --> 00:55:13,474
Lakhs of thoughts drowned me like tides

816
00:55:13,974 --> 00:55:21,849
Naughty separation is haunting me
My body is into shivering

817
00:55:21,974 --> 00:55:29,641
My heart today is asking that it needs him
What is this surprise, just one greed

818
00:55:29,974 --> 00:55:37,474
A naughty war is started within me

819
00:55:37,974 --> 00:55:45,807
Peace of yesterday is finished and
a slight earth quake started in me

820
00:55:46,224 --> 00:55:53,974
Something happened...
Something unknown is happening

821
00:55:54,016 --> 00:56:01,849
Something happened...
Something never experienced is happening

822
00:56:52,099 --> 00:56:59,557
Happiness in this silence has flown high

823
00:57:00,182 --> 00:57:07,891
The tears have drowned turning as a flood

824
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:15,682
It’s like this is not my body at all
Today is not like the day before

825
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:23,849
I feel is this really me?
A trance has overtaken me

826
00:57:24,099 --> 00:57:31,682
Every minute is a sweet hell
I’m seeing a new heaven in the pain

827
00:57:32,224 --> 00:57:39,849
My blood boiled sweetly
My red lip has shivered slightly

828
00:57:40,182 --> 00:57:47,849
Something happened...
Something unknown is happening

829
00:57:48,307 --> 00:57:56,307
Something happened...
Something never experienced is happening

830
00:58:09,266 --> 00:58:12,307
Sagar, I came to say an
important matter with you

831
00:58:17,016 --> 00:58:19,224
Actually, there is nobody at home

832
00:58:20,016 --> 00:58:22,974
I too thought to talk about
an important matter with you

833
00:58:23,224 --> 00:58:24,599
You came by then, come

834
00:58:25,099 --> 00:58:30,141
Where did you family members go Sagar?
It’s my aunt’s son’s marriage
I’m here as I didn’t feel like going

835
00:58:30,516 --> 00:58:31,641
Will you have some water?

836
00:58:31,932 --> 00:58:32,932
Thanks Sagar

837
00:58:36,391 --> 00:58:38,974
I’ve been all the steps you’re saying

838
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:41,641
But still, no change has come in me

839
00:58:43,099 --> 00:58:46,266
Somehow I don’t feel all
this is correct, Dharmika

840
00:58:52,682 --> 00:58:55,016
All written in this
books seem confused to me

841
00:58:55,516 --> 00:58:57,891
I don’t understand at
all even after great try

842
00:58:59,557 --> 00:59:04,599
Smile, anger and sorrow are
all basic human emotions right?

843
00:59:04,891 --> 00:59:07,266
How is it possible to be into
positive thinking always?

844
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:10,391
To forcibly stop these
and live like a Robo,

845
00:59:10,641 --> 00:59:13,432
it’s like a human killing his own
freedom, right Dharmika?

846
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,266
How can any human be happy
without having freedom?

847
00:59:19,891 --> 00:59:21,599
It’s not possible for me Dharmika

848
00:59:23,057 --> 00:59:25,057
I feel like I’m losing something

849
00:59:26,766 --> 00:59:30,450
Yes, he asked what will you do when the car fellow
pours mud on you, in the class that day, right? - Yes

850
00:59:30,474 --> 00:59:34,516
I really felt to stop that rascal,
scold dirty rascal and give a tight slap

851
00:59:35,057 --> 00:59:36,266
Because it’s me

852
00:59:36,849 --> 00:59:41,016
Saying no, it isn’t so
and I should take positive

853
00:59:41,432 --> 00:59:45,182
means I feel like being like someone else

854
00:59:46,682 --> 00:59:47,891
That is not me

855
00:59:51,057 --> 00:59:53,432
Yes, I read a book in the night

856
00:59:58,016 --> 00:59:59,016
Yes, it is there

857
01:00:05,182 --> 01:00:07,141
Chapter name is waste idealness it seems

858
01:00:07,307 --> 01:00:10,432
A dog is trying daily to cross the Lorry

859
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:13,016
But the owner of that
Dog is controlling that

860
01:00:13,182 --> 01:00:19,891
The neighbor says Sir, your dog is daily trying to cross
the lorry and asked why is he forcibly stopping it

861
01:00:19,932 --> 01:00:22,812
Then the owner of the dog says,
what would get if it does that by chance?

862
01:00:22,891 --> 01:00:29,432
A medal or name in the paper or bundles of
money and said why is this waste idealness

863
01:00:31,182 --> 01:00:33,682
Is a dog crossing lorry, a waste idealness?

864
01:00:34,266 --> 01:00:36,849
That dog would feel very happy
when it crosses the lorry right?

865
01:00:37,099 --> 01:00:38,891
That too would feel happy within right?

866
01:00:39,224 --> 01:00:41,516
Then how can that be a
waste idealness Dharmika?

867
01:00:42,099 --> 01:00:44,016
Who are all these to say no to happiness?

868
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:50,682
We can have all like short
term goals and long term goals

869
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:53,391
But all these are not getting into my brain

870
01:00:55,224 --> 01:00:56,516
May be to reach the goal

871
01:00:57,057 --> 01:01:04,099
oh no the time is getting out, how and what is happening...
I’m not understanding anything in all this confusion

872
01:01:04,266 --> 01:01:07,141
It’s like hitting on my
head with a huge stone

873
01:01:07,557 --> 01:01:11,682
Is this so only for me or to everyone?

874
01:01:13,766 --> 01:01:16,849
I’m not liking this at all - Sagar
I’m not liking

875
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:26,932
Sagar, cool down

876
01:01:29,807 --> 01:01:31,807
I’m frightened seeing myself

877
01:01:34,016 --> 01:01:41,516
To change like how my dad likes, I left
friends, cricket and movies. But still...

878
01:01:48,307 --> 01:01:52,224
Sagar, cool down Sagar
- Positive thinking, my foot!

879
01:01:52,307 --> 01:01:55,516
Please Sagar
Time table, my foot!

880
01:02:02,974 --> 01:02:07,016
Personality development, my foot! - Sagar

881
01:02:09,349 --> 01:02:10,557
I’m now happy

882
01:02:14,766 --> 01:02:17,807
Yes, I thought to change
as my dad likes right?

883
01:02:18,516 --> 01:02:19,974
Then why am I behaving so?

884
01:02:21,307 --> 01:02:26,891
Not getting studies and my dad
not liking... I’m a waste fellowh

885
01:02:26,974 --> 01:02:28,182
I don’t know anything

886
01:02:28,224 --> 01:02:30,391
Damn, my life is a waste

887
01:02:37,474 --> 01:02:40,724
Sagar, cool down Sagar

888
01:02:41,474 --> 01:02:42,682
Look

889
01:03:12,141 --> 01:03:12,849
Brother...

890
00:37:15,307 --> 00:37:16,141
Miss Dharmika

891
00:37:16,266 --> 00:37:21,474
it’s like I’m half changed because I’m one by one following
all the steps you said. I’ve just left out my idiots too

892
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:24,057
Why are you so excited so fast?

893
00:37:24,391 --> 00:37:27,349
There’s still a lots of syllabus
and you’ll know going ahead

894
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:32,849
Ok, you have the habit of reading books?

895
00:37:32,932 --> 00:37:34,307
Oh, I read so many

896
00:37:34,641 --> 00:37:35,182
Oh no

897
00:37:35,432 --> 00:37:37,807
you too have the habit of reading books?
- Yes, I read

898
00:37:38,224 --> 00:37:39,224
What books do you read?

899
00:37:39,682 --> 00:37:43,349
Swathi, Abhisarika, Chitramalini, Santo...
- Shut up

900
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:46,974
I’m not asking about such books

901
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,974
but about books that are helpful for life

902
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:51,974
Oh, then I’ve read only
one book from my childhood

903
00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:53,659
The tables book from Venkataramana & Co

904
00:37:53,807 --> 00:37:58,516
You know what, if you ask me
right away I cannot even say table 2...

905
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:02,099
Move on

906
00:38:11,307 --> 00:38:13,807
Yes... Five steps to success

907
00:38:14,057 --> 00:38:15,266
Six steps to success

908
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:16,849
Success in your hands

909
00:38:17,224 --> 00:38:18,432
Success is yours...

910
00:38:18,849 --> 00:38:22,432
Self confidence or.... Yes...

911
00:38:22,641 --> 00:38:25,016
Hey, what happened? - Miss Dharmika...

912
00:38:25,391 --> 00:38:27,516
You have come into my
life really like a Goddess

913
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:31,724
My eyes are seeing the books
helpful in life for the first time

914
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:35,557
I’m feeling like to read
all these books at once

915
00:38:36,557 --> 00:38:37,766
This is the problem with you.

916
00:38:37,891 --> 00:38:39,099
Do not read whatever you see

917
00:38:39,182 --> 00:38:42,599
I’ll say what to follow in
those and what not to follow

918
00:38:43,057 --> 00:38:44,432
Understood? - Yes, understood

919
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:50,432
Wow, yes! New book of Ram D
Sekhar, I’m so lucky

920
00:38:51,474 --> 00:38:51,891
Excuse me

921
00:38:52,141 --> 00:38:54,641
has the book How to earn
money from CV Rao sir come?

922
00:38:54,682 --> 00:38:57,762
He did not publish as Sir does not have
the money and it takes two more months

923
00:38:58,557 --> 00:39:01,266
Miss Dharmika,
shall we take any books even for me?

924
00:39:01,516 --> 00:39:02,266
No need

925
00:39:02,474 --> 00:39:04,516
come to my house and take - Ok move on

926
00:39:08,432 --> 00:39:12,641
Oh no, so many cups,
so many prizes and so many shields

927
00:39:12,891 --> 00:39:15,307
Miss Dharmika,
are you even a child prodigy?

928
00:39:15,516 --> 00:39:21,349
Not once, I was the child
prodigy from 1999 to 2004

929
00:39:22,641 --> 00:39:26,266
If I too was a child prodigy,
my dad would have been very happy

930
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:28,724
It should be in the fate for everything

931
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:36,016
Hello, saying not in fate, my bad luck, my stars
are bad are all the words from the losers

932
00:39:36,224 --> 00:39:38,144
Then what are the words
from the winners, madam?

933
00:39:38,682 --> 00:39:46,099
I will achieve, yes I can, I have never ending
power, I have the power, I am the winner...

934
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:50,266
Wow, it is so great. My hairs are
going stiff when you are saying

935
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:53,182
You are talking so rhythmic
like a father in the church

936
00:39:53,807 --> 00:39:55,099
Still, all these are not my own

937
00:39:55,474 --> 00:39:57,599
but written by my favorite
write Ram V Sekhar

938
00:39:59,057 --> 00:40:00,266
I think it’s five years back

939
00:40:00,474 --> 00:40:04,266
a girl committed suicide for
not getting his book in Warangal

940
00:40:04,932 --> 00:40:06,349
He’s become more famous from then

941
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:09,099
Here are the books of Ram V Sekhar

942
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:10,557
Take them and read

943
00:40:10,682 --> 00:40:12,807
He will introduce yourself new to you

944
00:40:13,141 --> 00:40:16,349
He’ll pull out that great power within you

945
00:40:16,557 --> 00:40:17,557
ok

946
00:40:17,932 --> 00:40:18,932
Thanks

947
00:40:49,474 --> 00:40:51,016
Brother, please give me that bat

948
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:52,891
Yes, I got the bat

949
00:41:35,724 --> 00:41:37,391
Mom, give me 4000

950
00:41:37,557 --> 00:41:39,307
4000, for what?

951
00:41:39,932 --> 00:41:42,349
That is... There is a great
man named Ram V Sekhar

952
00:41:42,432 --> 00:41:45,099
He gives personality development
classes and I wanted to join those

953
00:41:45,141 --> 00:41:47,516
Personality development? - Yes
What is that son?

954
00:41:48,224 --> 00:41:49,849
Oh no, how do I say you mom...

955
00:41:49,891 --> 00:41:51,766
Yes, dad always says right?

956
00:41:51,807 --> 00:41:56,391
Discipline, sincerity and obe...
Obedience yes that

957
00:41:56,432 --> 00:41:57,724
How do all these come

958
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:02,307
how should they be and he teaches
how to get better in life, mom

959
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:04,932
Are they giving classes even to get better?
- Yes

960
00:42:05,057 --> 00:42:06,766
Still, the rate is very high right?

961
00:42:06,932 --> 00:42:08,182
I’ll give 200, take it

962
00:42:08,307 --> 00:42:10,849
You think this is any
of your tailoring class?

963
00:42:10,891 --> 00:42:12,158
It’s personality development class mom

964
00:42:12,182 --> 00:42:13,182
Leave it son

965
00:42:13,224 --> 00:42:15,016
what do I know about his business?

966
00:42:15,057 --> 00:42:16,974
I have one thousand, take it and give him

967
00:42:17,016 --> 00:42:19,432
I need 3000 more mom,
arrange somehow please

968
00:42:19,474 --> 00:42:20,974
I will get from your dad and give

969
00:42:21,016 --> 00:42:22,349
Thanks mom, thanks

970
00:42:25,182 --> 00:42:27,141
Money will be in the almirah
inside, go and take

971
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:29,599
Hey

972
00:42:30,057 --> 00:42:32,307
Take 500 more,
it would be for your expenses

973
00:42:33,891 --> 00:42:34,891
ok dad

974
00:42:45,141 --> 00:42:48,224
Hey, great change has
come these days in Sagar

975
00:42:48,932 --> 00:42:50,891
Sagar before and Sagar
now are different - Oh

976
00:42:51,224 --> 00:42:53,807
Our Ram V Sekhar is there right? - Who?

977
00:42:54,016 --> 00:42:57,474
I mean, he takes these personality
development classes and all - Yes

978
00:42:57,516 --> 00:42:58,807
He is reading his books too

979
00:42:59,516 --> 00:43:03,099
He was going around for movies
and roaming around right? - Yes

980
00:43:03,224 --> 00:43:06,224
Now, he is sitting with books
from the morning - Super

981
00:43:06,766 --> 00:43:08,474
I feel very happy now seeing him

982
00:43:09,557 --> 00:43:13,141
Ok, why not come home taking
some time? We can have a good chat - Sure

983
00:43:13,474 --> 00:43:14,557
See you dude - Ok

984
00:43:32,432 --> 00:43:35,516
Did you read the latest
book of Ram V Sekhar

985
00:43:35,724 --> 00:43:39,141
I didn’t read full but read
till the”Aimed arrow” chapter

986
00:43:39,432 --> 00:43:42,641
Yes, there is another chapter
after that named “Path fixing”

987
00:43:42,849 --> 00:43:46,599
That would be extra ordinary
I read it daily to him

988
00:43:46,766 --> 00:43:49,349
Yes sister, I like that chapter a lot

989
00:43:49,807 --> 00:43:51,224
If I had come here in his age

990
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:52,682
I would’ve been elsewhere

991
00:43:52,849 --> 00:43:53,599
Hey brother

992
00:43:53,724 --> 00:43:55,599
are you fine? - Hi, I am fine

993
00:43:55,641 --> 00:43:58,432
You think I would get any
better coming to this class?

994
00:43:58,474 --> 00:43:59,754
There would be a result for sure

995
00:43:59,891 --> 00:44:01,932
If we follow his ideology correctly

996
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:03,307
it’s like we reached our goal

997
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,474
Many thanks brother

998
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:06,599
Dharmika, he is Sravan
and a great prodigy like

999
00:44:06,641 --> 00:44:07,641
Hello.. hi

1000
00:44:08,307 --> 00:44:10,891
All of you be silent

1001
00:44:11,432 --> 00:44:13,724
The great, Ram V Sekhar is arrived

1002
00:44:13,891 --> 00:44:16,432
He is going to come on to
this dais within 2 minutes

1003
00:44:16,516 --> 00:44:19,016
All of you be alert, be active

1004
00:44:31,766 --> 00:44:32,974
Good evening everybody

1005
00:44:33,141 --> 00:44:34,557
Good evening Sir

1006
00:44:35,432 --> 00:44:38,766
The person without a
goal is equal to a donkey

1007
00:44:39,974 --> 00:44:47,766
When a guy with goal works for his goal the
person with no goal works for the guy with a goal

1008
00:44:48,141 --> 00:44:51,016
That means when the guy
with goal becomes a Doctor

1009
00:44:51,307 --> 00:44:56,724
the guy without goal works
like a donkey as his peon

1010
00:44:57,307 --> 00:45:02,182
Say now, all of you here have
some or the other goal or not?

1011
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:03,724
Yes, we have

1012
00:45:03,974 --> 00:45:09,182
Say loud and with love
We have a goal, we have a goal

1013
00:45:09,266 --> 00:45:14,224
Say again and with love
We have a goal, we have a goal

1014
00:45:14,516 --> 00:45:17,599
Then, in how many days
can you reach that goal?

1015
00:45:17,974 --> 00:45:19,016
Do you know?

1016
00:45:19,099 --> 00:45:20,141
No

1017
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:22,599
Don’t know?

1018
00:45:22,974 --> 00:45:27,766
I’ll let you know in how many
days can you reach your goal

1019
00:45:27,932 --> 00:45:28,932
Any body...

1020
00:45:32,224 --> 00:45:33,432
Oh, come on!

1021
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:35,141
Yes clap, clap...

1022
00:45:35,557 --> 00:45:37,682
clap... Very good...

1023
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:39,599
Please come...

1024
00:45:41,391 --> 00:45:43,557
Good, be seated

1025
00:45:45,891 --> 00:45:48,141
What is your name dear? - Sagar

1026
00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:50,974
Sagar, what is your goal?

1027
00:45:52,057 --> 00:45:54,391
My goal is to change as my dad, Sir - What?

1028
00:45:59,016 --> 00:46:01,099
You wish to become as your dad likes

1029
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:01,891
Yes Sir

1030
00:46:02,057 --> 00:46:04,599
I’ll now put ten questions to you. - Ok sir

1031
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:05,849
Question number one...

1032
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:10,682
It rained and all roads
are flowing with water.

1033
00:46:11,182 --> 00:46:14,599
You were going on that roadside
and a car went fast on that road

1034
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:17,766
Water squashed and your
white shirt got spoilt.

1035
00:46:17,891 --> 00:46:19,224
Then, your reactions

1036
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:22,516
A.. I’ll throw stone
screaming, you dirty idiot

1037
00:46:22,891 --> 00:46:27,682
B.. I’ll sit there and cry thinking
the time is bad and today is not favoring

1038
00:46:27,891 --> 00:46:32,349
C.. I’ll think should not wear white shirt
in rainy season and come on to the roads

1039
00:46:32,391 --> 00:46:38,516
D.. As this society will never change, I’ll
wear that white shirt as it as and come

1040
00:46:39,141 --> 00:46:41,932
What is your option
from these four options?

1041
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,557
Obviously option A Sir

1042
00:46:52,766 --> 00:46:54,891
- You would throw a stone
saying you dirty rascal

1043
00:46:55,099 --> 00:46:56,099
Yes sir, it is so

1044
00:46:56,349 --> 00:46:57,349
Question number 2

1045
00:46:59,307 --> 00:47:02,474
You’ve been waiting for the train.
It’s already an hour.

1046
00:47:02,641 --> 00:47:04,700
You asked the guy adjacent as
to when would the train come

1047
00:47:04,724 --> 00:47:07,099
He said it would take two more hours.

1048
00:47:07,557 --> 00:47:08,599
What’ll you do then?

1049
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:12,307
A.. I’ll go to a film as
still there is two hours

1050
00:47:12,516 --> 00:47:17,182
B.. I scold Railway department
people filthily and go home

1051
00:47:17,307 --> 00:47:21,891
Option C, there is a book shop beside and will
read buying personality development books

1052
00:47:22,057 --> 00:47:24,766
Option D,
I keep playing games on cell phone

1053
00:47:28,224 --> 00:47:29,891
I have two options sir, A and D

1054
00:47:30,516 --> 00:47:32,141
You’ll go to a film - Yes Sir

1055
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,766
If not keep playing games - Yes sir

1056
00:47:34,099 --> 00:47:35,391
Ok? - Ok sir

1057
00:47:36,682 --> 00:47:37,682
Mr. Sagar

1058
00:47:38,766 --> 00:47:40,182
No need of 10 questions for you

1059
00:47:41,182 --> 00:47:42,182
two are enough

1060
00:47:42,724 --> 00:47:44,016
Even two are not needed

1061
00:47:44,432 --> 00:47:45,557
the first one was enough

1062
00:47:46,307 --> 00:47:47,307
Look man

1063
00:47:48,141 --> 00:47:52,057
if you throw a stone screaming
you dirty rascal what will happen?

1064
00:47:52,557 --> 00:47:58,266
He will stop the car and come down from the
car. You both fight and scold each other

1065
00:47:58,391 --> 00:47:59,391
What will happen?

1066
00:47:59,432 --> 00:48:00,641
It becomes a dirty mess

1067
00:48:01,016 --> 00:48:03,141
Think positively, you are an youngster

1068
00:48:03,474 --> 00:48:06,474
You’ll come up in life only
if you think very positive

1069
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:07,599
Understand?

1070
00:48:10,766 --> 00:48:13,141
It’s very tough for guys
like you thinking negatively

1071
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,974
You know what’s the answer
of the person reaching goals?

1072
00:48:16,391 --> 00:48:19,682
C, the person choosing C
option will reach the goal.

1073
00:48:20,224 --> 00:48:22,474
How many are from you choosing C?

1074
00:48:27,182 --> 00:48:30,224
Oh, total! Very good, bring the hands down

1075
00:48:32,057 --> 00:48:35,641
Look, it’s two hours of time
waste going to a film dear

1076
00:48:36,266 --> 00:48:38,932
It’s further waste to
play games on cell phone

1077
00:48:39,099 --> 00:48:40,141
And you are very waste.

1078
00:48:42,307 --> 00:48:43,307
You are unfit.

1079
00:48:45,266 --> 00:48:48,557
You cannot reach the goal of your
father, you cannot

1080
00:49:15,307 --> 00:49:16,516
Why are you feeling so much?

1081
00:49:21,766 --> 00:49:23,182
I like my daddy very much

1082
00:49:24,432 --> 00:49:26,474
Even my dad liked me a lot in my childhood

1083
00:49:27,266 --> 00:49:31,057
But when I started going to
school, exams have started.

1084
00:49:31,724 --> 00:49:34,766
Immediately the results and all were zeroes

1085
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:39,599
Those marks used to come
as a devil blocking me and my dad

1086
00:49:40,474 --> 00:49:42,057
You know what happened once

1087
00:49:42,474 --> 00:49:46,016
My dad took me out to
teach cycling as a kid

1088
00:49:46,724 --> 00:49:47,724
Take left, left... Yes...

1089
00:49:49,891 --> 00:49:51,099
Yes, super...

1090
00:49:55,974 --> 00:49:58,266
Sir, hello
Hello Mr. Rami Reddy

1091
00:49:58,307 --> 00:49:59,641
Why are you sitting here?

1092
00:49:59,891 --> 00:50:01,516
I’m teaching my son to cycle

1093
00:50:01,807 --> 00:50:06,057
You can teach cycling to your son later
but teach him Mathematics tables first Sir

1094
00:50:06,307 --> 00:50:08,766
Has he said his marks
from second unit test?

1095
00:50:09,224 --> 00:50:12,266
Zero! What are you and what is this zero?

1096
00:50:12,891 --> 00:50:16,891
I feel ashamed Sir, concentrate
a bit on studies of your son Sir

1097
00:50:16,974 --> 00:50:20,516
When my Mathematics teacher that day
said that I am very weak in studies

1098
00:50:21,182 --> 00:50:22,849
my dad felt very insulted

1099
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:27,849
daddy

1100
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:30,599
Daddy, I got it.

1101
00:50:32,141 --> 00:50:33,141
Daddy

1102
00:50:34,307 --> 00:50:35,641
Daddy, I got it.

1103
00:50:44,016 --> 00:50:45,807
He didn’t care even when I fell down.

1104
00:50:46,432 --> 00:50:47,891
From then till now,

1105
00:50:48,682 --> 00:50:50,641
I’ve been trying to get close to him

1106
00:50:52,766 --> 00:50:55,182
Just now those questions and answers

1107
00:50:55,391 --> 00:50:58,807
when I was said cannot do what I wished...

1108
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:03,307
My whole mind went upset. I didn’t understand
anything Everything seems confused and shabby

1109
00:51:52,432 --> 00:51:53,516
Huh Sagar

1110
00:51:53,557 --> 00:51:54,099
sagar

1111
00:51:54,516 --> 00:51:55,432
Who is Sagar?

1112
00:51:55,474 --> 00:51:56,224
What happened to you?

1113
00:51:56,307 --> 00:51:57,932
Nothing sister

1114
00:51:58,224 --> 00:52:00,766
I’m reading the paper and said so in a flow

1115
00:52:01,932 --> 00:52:03,724
I transferred the money, check once

1116
00:52:04,682 --> 00:52:07,307
Ok sister, ok

1117
00:52:09,724 --> 00:52:10,891
Ok sister good night

1118
00:52:16,391 --> 00:52:22,432
Cot A+B equal to SAGAR...

1119
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:41,307
To control your feelings, draw a circle
stand in between and repeat up to ten times

1120
00:52:41,349 --> 00:52:47,391
I should not fall in love with Sagar...

1121
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:52,099
If your feelings are still not controlled,
you should write ten times imposition

1122
00:52:52,766 --> 00:52:55,141
Huh... Not 10 but I’ll write times...

1123
00:52:55,641 --> 00:53:00,391
I should not fall in love with Sagar...

1124
00:53:02,307 --> 00:53:03,307
yes

1125
00:53:04,557 --> 00:53:05,807
Yes, 100 times finish...

1126
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:29,932
Something happened...
Something unknown is happening

1127
00:53:30,057 --> 00:53:37,891
Something happened...
Something never experienced is happening

1128
00:53:38,474 --> 00:53:45,891
I feel cold in the burning sun
I am sweating in the cool weather

1129
00:53:46,474 --> 00:53:53,432
A rain has started in the heart
I feel like my life is going

1130
00:53:54,016 --> 00:54:02,016
My age is given a sweet wound
Love has called me loud

1131
00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:10,099
What is this greed and what is this love?
It’s a thirst unfilled drinking up the sea

1132
00:54:10,141 --> 00:54:17,932
Something happened...
Something unknown is happening

1133
00:54:18,057 --> 00:54:25,932
Something happened...
Something never experienced is happening

1134
00:54:25,974 --> 00:54:27,724
Two... - I should change like my dad likes

1135
00:54:27,766 --> 00:54:29,242
Three...
- I should change like my dad likes

1136
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,986
Four... - I should change like my dad likes

1137
00:54:31,016 --> 00:54:32,533
Five... - I should change like my dad likes

1138
00:54:32,557 --> 00:54:34,117
Six... - I should change like my dad likes

1139
00:54:34,141 --> 00:54:36,516
Seven, eight, nine and ten...
It’s over brother, enough now

1140
00:54:36,557 --> 00:54:38,242
Please ten more times - How
much more time brother, please?

1141
00:54:38,266 --> 00:54:40,099
Eleven...
- I should change like my dad likes

1142
00:54:44,016 --> 00:54:46,599
What is this son,
writing so for so many times?

1143
00:54:46,932 --> 00:54:48,932
Have you seen your face, how it is become?

1144
00:54:48,974 --> 00:54:53,432
I should work hard, right mom? How if I don’t work
hard? Is it any easy to change like how dad likes?

1145
00:54:58,182 --> 00:55:05,807
Like the groups of birds
reaching the eyes having dreams

1146
00:55:05,849 --> 00:55:13,474
Lakhs of thoughts drowned me like tides

1147
00:55:13,974 --> 00:55:21,849
Naughty separation is haunting me
My body is into shivering

1148
00:55:21,974 --> 00:55:29,641
My heart today is asking that it needs him
What is this surprise, just one greed

1149
00:55:29,974 --> 00:55:37,474
A naughty war is started within me

1150
00:55:37,974 --> 00:55:45,807
Peace of yesterday is finished and
a slight earth quake started in me

1151
00:55:46,224 --> 00:55:53,974
Something happened...
Something unknown is happening

1152
00:55:54,016 --> 00:56:01,849
Something happened...
Something never experienced is happening

1153
00:56:52,099 --> 00:56:59,557
Happiness in this silence has flown high

1154
00:57:00,182 --> 00:57:07,891
The tears have drowned turning as a flood

1155
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:15,682
It’s like this is not my body at all
Today is not like the day before

1156
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:23,849
I feel is this really me?
A trance has overtaken me

1157
00:57:24,099 --> 00:57:31,682
Every minute is a sweet hell
I’m seeing a new heaven in the pain

1158
00:57:32,224 --> 00:57:39,849
My blood boiled sweetly
My red lip has shivered slightly

1159
00:57:40,182 --> 00:57:47,849
Something happened...
Something unknown is happening

1160
00:57:48,307 --> 00:57:56,307
Something happened...
Something never experienced is happening

1161
00:58:09,266 --> 00:58:12,307
Sagar, I came to say an
important matter with you

1162
00:58:17,016 --> 00:58:19,224
Actually, there is nobody at home

1163
00:58:20,016 --> 00:58:22,974
I too thought to talk about
an important matter with you

1164
00:58:23,224 --> 00:58:24,599
You came by then, come

1165
00:58:25,099 --> 00:58:30,141
Where did you family members go Sagar?
It’s my aunt’s son’s marriage
I’m here as I didn’t feel like going

1166
00:58:30,516 --> 00:58:31,641
Will you have some water?

1167
00:58:31,932 --> 00:58:32,932
Thanks Sagar

1168
00:58:36,391 --> 00:58:38,974
I’ve been all the steps you’re saying

1169
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:41,641
But still, no change has come in me

1170
00:58:43,099 --> 00:58:46,266
Somehow I don’t feel all
this is correct, Dharmika

1171
00:58:52,682 --> 00:58:55,016
All written in this
books seem confused to me

1172
00:58:55,516 --> 00:58:57,891
I don’t understand at
all even after great try

1173
00:58:59,557 --> 00:59:04,599
Smile, anger and sorrow are
all basic human emotions right?

1174
00:59:04,891 --> 00:59:07,266
How is it possible to be into
positive thinking always?

1175
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:10,391
To forcibly stop these
and live like a Robo,

1176
00:59:10,641 --> 00:59:13,432
it’s like a human killing his own
freedom, right Dharmika?

1177
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,266
How can any human be happy
without having freedom?

1178
00:59:19,891 --> 00:59:21,599
It’s not possible for me Dharmika

1179
00:59:23,057 --> 00:59:25,057
I feel like I’m losing something

1180
00:59:26,766 --> 00:59:30,450
Yes, he asked what will you do when the car fellow
pours mud on you, in the class that day, right? - Yes

1181
00:59:30,474 --> 00:59:34,516
I really felt to stop that rascal,
scold dirty rascal and give a tight slap

1182
00:59:35,057 --> 00:59:36,266
Because it’s me

1183
00:59:36,849 --> 00:59:41,016
Saying no, it isn’t so
and I should take positive

1184
00:59:41,432 --> 00:59:45,182
means I feel like being like someone else

1185
00:59:46,682 --> 00:59:47,891
That is not me

1186
00:59:51,057 --> 00:59:53,432
Yes, I read a book in the night

1187
00:59:58,016 --> 00:59:59,016
Yes, it is there

1188
01:00:05,182 --> 01:00:07,141
Chapter name is waste idealness it seems

1189
01:00:07,307 --> 01:00:10,432
A dog is trying daily to cross the Lorry

1190
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:13,016
But the owner of that
Dog is controlling that

1191
01:00:13,182 --> 01:00:19,891
The neighbor says Sir, your dog is daily trying to cross
the lorry and asked why is he forcibly stopping it

1192
01:00:19,932 --> 01:00:22,812
Then the owner of the dog says,
what would get if it does that by chance?

1193
01:00:22,891 --> 01:00:29,432
A medal or name in the paper or bundles of
money and said why is this waste idealness

1194
01:00:31,182 --> 01:00:33,682
Is a dog crossing lorry, a waste idealness?

1195
01:00:34,266 --> 01:00:36,849
That dog would feel very happy
when it crosses the lorry right?

1196
01:00:37,099 --> 01:00:38,891
That too would feel happy within right?

1197
01:00:39,224 --> 01:00:41,516
Then how can that be a
waste idealness Dharmika?

1198
01:00:42,099 --> 01:00:44,016
Who are all these to say no to happiness?

1199
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:50,682
We can have all like short
term goals and long term goals

1200
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:53,391
But all these are not getting into my brain

1201
01:00:55,224 --> 01:00:56,516
May be to reach the goal

1202
01:00:57,057 --> 01:01:04,099
oh no the time is getting out, how and what is happening...
I’m not understanding anything in all this confusion

1203
01:01:04,266 --> 01:01:07,141
It’s like hitting on my
head with a huge stone

1204
01:01:07,557 --> 01:01:11,682
Is this so only for me or to everyone?

1205
01:01:13,766 --> 01:01:16,849
I’m not liking this at all - Sagar
I’m not liking

1206
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:26,932
Sagar, cool down

1207
01:01:29,807 --> 01:01:31,807
I’m frightened seeing myself

1208
01:01:34,016 --> 01:01:41,516
To change like how my dad likes, I left
friends, cricket and movies. But still...

1209
01:01:48,307 --> 01:01:52,224
Sagar, cool down Sagar
- Positive thinking, my foot!

1210
01:01:52,307 --> 01:01:55,516
Please Sagar
Time table, my foot!

1211
01:02:02,974 --> 01:02:07,016
Personality development, my foot! - Sagar

1212
01:02:09,349 --> 01:02:10,557
I’m now happy

1213
01:02:14,766 --> 01:02:17,807
Yes, I thought to change
as my dad likes right?

1214
01:02:18,516 --> 01:02:19,974
Then why am I behaving so?

1215
01:02:21,307 --> 01:02:26,891
Not getting studies and my dad
not liking... I’m a waste fellowh

1216
01:02:26,974 --> 01:02:28,182
I don’t know anything

1217
01:02:28,224 --> 01:02:30,391
Damn, my life is a waste

1218
01:02:37,474 --> 01:02:40,724
Sagar, cool down Sagar

1219
01:02:41,474 --> 01:02:42,682
Look

1220
01:03:12,141 --> 01:03:12,849
Brother...

1221
00:37:15,307 --> 00:37:16,141
Miss Dharmika

1222
00:37:16,266 --> 00:37:21,474
it’s like I’m half changed because I’m one by one following
all the steps you said. I’ve just left out my idiots too

1223
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:24,057
Why are you so excited so fast?

1224
00:37:24,391 --> 00:37:27,349
There’s still a lots of syllabus
and you’ll know going ahead

1225
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:32,849
Ok, you have the habit of reading books?

1226
00:37:32,932 --> 00:37:34,307
Oh, I read so many

1227
00:37:34,641 --> 00:37:35,182
Oh no

1228
00:37:35,432 --> 00:37:37,807
you too have the habit of reading books?
- Yes, I read

1229
00:37:38,224 --> 00:37:39,224
What books do you read?

1230
00:37:39,682 --> 00:37:43,349
Swathi, Abhisarika, Chitramalini, Santo...
- Shut up

1231
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:46,974
I’m not asking about such books

1232
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,974
but about books that are helpful for life

1233
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:51,974
Oh, then I’ve read only
one book from my childhood

1234
00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:53,659
The tables book from Venkataramana & Co

1235
00:37:53,807 --> 00:37:58,516
You know what, if you ask me
right away I cannot even say table 2...

1236
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:02,099
Move on

1237
00:38:11,307 --> 00:38:13,807
Yes... Five steps to success

1238
00:38:14,057 --> 00:38:15,266
Six steps to success

1239
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:16,849
Success in your hands

1240
00:38:17,224 --> 00:38:18,432
Success is yours...

1241
00:38:18,849 --> 00:38:22,432
Self confidence or.... Yes...

1242
00:38:22,641 --> 00:38:25,016
Hey, what happened? - Miss Dharmika...

1243
00:38:25,391 --> 00:38:27,516
You have come into my
life really like a Goddess

1244
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:31,724
My eyes are seeing the books
helpful in life for the first time

1245
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:35,557
I’m feeling like to read
all these books at once

1246
00:38:36,557 --> 00:38:37,766
This is the problem with you.

1247
00:38:37,891 --> 00:38:39,099
Do not read whatever you see

1248
00:38:39,182 --> 00:38:42,599
I’ll say what to follow in
those and what not to follow

1249
00:38:43,057 --> 00:38:44,432
Understood? - Yes, understood

1250
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:50,432
Wow, yes! New book of Ram D
Sekhar, I’m so lucky

1251
00:38:51,474 --> 00:38:51,891
Excuse me

1252
00:38:52,141 --> 00:38:54,641
has the book How to earn
money from CV Rao sir come?

1253
00:38:54,682 --> 00:38:57,762
He did not publish as Sir does not have
the money and it takes two more months

1254
00:38:58,557 --> 00:39:01,266
Miss Dharmika,
shall we take any books even for me?

1255
00:39:01,516 --> 00:39:02,266
No need

1256
00:39:02,474 --> 00:39:04,516
come to my house and take - Ok move on

1257
00:39:08,432 --> 00:39:12,641
Oh no, so many cups,
so many prizes and so many shields

1258
00:39:12,891 --> 00:39:15,307
Miss Dharmika,
are you even a child prodigy?

1259
00:39:15,516 --> 00:39:21,349
Not once, I was the child
prodigy from 1999 to 2004

1260
00:39:22,641 --> 00:39:26,266
If I too was a child prodigy,
my dad would have been very happy

1261
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:28,724
It should be in the fate for everything

1262
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:36,016
Hello, saying not in fate, my bad luck, my stars
are bad are all the words from the losers

1263
00:39:36,224 --> 00:39:38,144
Then what are the words
from the winners, madam?

1264
00:39:38,682 --> 00:39:46,099
I will achieve, yes I can, I have never ending
power, I have the power, I am the winner...

1265
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:50,266
Wow, it is so great. My hairs are
going stiff when you are saying

1266
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:53,182
You are talking so rhythmic
like a father in the church

1267
00:39:53,807 --> 00:39:55,099
Still, all these are not my own

1268
00:39:55,474 --> 00:39:57,599
but written by my favorite
write Ram V Sekhar

1269
00:39:59,057 --> 00:40:00,266
I think it’s five years back

1270
00:40:00,474 --> 00:40:04,266
a girl committed suicide for
not getting his book in Warangal

1271
00:40:04,932 --> 00:40:06,349
He’s become more famous from then

1272
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:09,099
Here are the books of Ram V Sekhar

1273
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:10,557
Take them and read

1274
00:40:10,682 --> 00:40:12,807
He will introduce yourself new to you

1275
00:40:13,141 --> 00:40:16,349
He’ll pull out that great power within you

1276
00:40:16,557 --> 00:40:17,557
ok

1277
00:40:17,932 --> 00:40:18,932
Thanks

1278
00:40:49,474 --> 00:40:51,016
Brother, please give me that bat

1279
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:52,891
Yes, I got the bat

1280
00:41:35,724 --> 00:41:37,391
Mom, give me 4000

1281
00:41:37,557 --> 00:41:39,307
4000, for what?

1282
00:41:39,932 --> 00:41:42,349
That is... There is a great
man named Ram V Sekhar

1283
00:41:42,432 --> 00:41:45,099
He gives personality development
classes and I wanted to join those

1284
00:41:45,141 --> 00:41:47,516
Personality development? - Yes
What is that son?

1285
00:41:48,224 --> 00:41:49,849
Oh no, how do I say you mom...

1286
00:41:49,891 --> 00:41:51,766
Yes, dad always says right?

1287
00:41:51,807 --> 00:41:56,391
Discipline, sincerity and obe...
Obedience yes that

1288
00:41:56,432 --> 00:41:57,724
How do all these come

1289
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:02,307
how should they be and he teaches
how to get better in life, mom

1290
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:04,932
Are they giving classes even to get better?
- Yes

1291
00:42:05,057 --> 00:42:06,766
Still, the rate is very high right?

1292
00:42:06,932 --> 00:42:08,182
I’ll give 200, take it

1293
00:42:08,307 --> 00:42:10,849
You think this is any
of your tailoring class?

1294
00:42:10,891 --> 00:42:12,158
It’s personality development class mom

1295
00:42:12,182 --> 00:42:13,182
Leave it son

1296
00:42:13,224 --> 00:42:15,016
what do I know about his business?

1297
00:42:15,057 --> 00:42:16,974
I have one thousand, take it and give him

1298
00:42:17,016 --> 00:42:19,432
I need 3000 more mom,
arrange somehow please

1299
00:42:19,474 --> 00:42:20,974

1300
00:42:21,016 --> 00:42:22,349
Thanks mom, thanks

1301
00:42:25,182 --> 00:42:27,141
Money will be in the almirah
inside, go and take

1302
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:29,599
Hey

1303
00:42:30,057 --> 00:42:32,307
Take 500 more,
it would be for your expenses

1304
00:42:33,891 --> 00:42:34,891
ok dad

1305
00:42:45,141 --> 00:42:48,224
Hey, great change has
come these days in Sagar

1306
00:42:48,932 --> 00:42:50,891
Sagar before and Sagar
now are different - Oh

1307
00:42:51,224 --> 00:42:53,807
Our Ram V Sekhar is there right? - Who?

1308
00:42:54,016 --> 00:42:57,474
I mean, he takes these personality
development classes and all - Yes

1309
00:42:57,516 --> 00:42:58,807
He is reading his books too

1310
00:42:59,516 --> 00:43:03,099
He was going around for movies
and roaming around right? - Yes

1311
00:43:03,224 --> 00:43:06,224
Now, he is sitting with books
from the morning - Super

1312
00:43:06,766 --> 00:43:08,474
I feel very happy now seeing him

1313
00:43:09,557 --> 00:43:13,141
Ok, why not come home taking
some time? We can have a good chat - Sure

1314
00:43:13,474 --> 00:43:14,557
See you dude - Ok

1315
00:43:32,432 --> 00:43:35,516
Did you read the latest
book of Ram V Sekhar

1316
00:43:35,724 --> 00:43:39,141
I didn’t read full but read
till the”Aimed arrow” chapter

1317
00:43:39,432 --> 00:43:42,641
Yes, there is another chapter
after that named “Path fixing”

1318
00:43:42,849 --> 00:43:46,599
That would be extra ordinary
I read it daily to him

1319
00:43:46,766 --> 00:43:49,349
Yes sister, I like that chapter a lot

1320
00:43:49,807 --> 00:43:51,224
If I had come here in his age

1321
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:52,682
I would’ve been elsewhere

1322
00:43:52,849 --> 00:43:53,599
Hey brother

1323
00:43:53,724 --> 00:43:55,599
are you fine? - Hi, I am fine

1324
00:43:55,641 --> 00:43:58,432
You think I would get any
better coming to this class?

1325
00:43:58,474 --> 00:43:59,754
There would be a result for sure

1326
00:43:59,891 --> 00:44:01,932
If we follow his ideology correctly

1327
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:03,307
it’s like we reached our goal

1328
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,474
Many thanks brother

1329
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:06,599
Dharmika, he is Sravan
and a great prodigy like

1330
00:44:06,641 --> 00:44:07,641
Hello.. hi

1331
00:44:08,307 --> 00:44:10,891
All of you be silent

1332
00:44:11,432 --> 00:44:13,724
The great, Ram V Sekhar is arrived

1333
00:44:13,891 --> 00:44:16,432
He is going to come on to
this dais within 2 minutes

1334
00:44:16,516 --> 00:44:19,016
All of you be alert, be active

1335
00:44:31,766 --> 00:44:32,974
Good evening everybody

1336
00:44:33,141 --> 00:44:34,557
Good evening Sir

1337
00:44:35,432 --> 00:44:38,766
The person without a
goal is equal to a donkey

1338
00:44:39,974 --> 00:44:47,766
When a guy with goal works for his goal the
person with no goal works for the guy with a goal

1339
00:44:48,141 --> 00:44:51,016
That means when the guy
with goal becomes a Doctor

1340
00:44:51,307 --> 00:44:56,724
the guy without goal works
like a donkey as his peon

1341
00:44:57,307 --> 00:45:02,182
Say now, all of you here have
some or the other goal or not?

1342
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:03,724
Yes, we have

1343
00:45:03,974 --> 00:45:09,182
Say loud and with love
We have a goal, we have a goal

1344
00:45:09,266 --> 00:45:14,224
Say again and with love
We have a goal, we have a goal

1345
00:45:14,516 --> 00:45:17,599
Then, in how many days
can you reach that goal?

1346
00:45:17,974 --> 00:45:19,016
Do you know?

1347
00:45:19,099 --> 00:45:20,141
No

1348
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:22,599
Don’t know?

1349
00:45:22,974 --> 00:45:27,766
I’ll let you know in how many
days can you reach your goal

1350
00:45:27,932 --> 00:45:28,932
Any body...

1351
00:45:32,224 --> 00:45:33,432
Oh, come on!

1352
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:35,141
Yes clap, clap...

1353
00:45:35,557 --> 00:45:37,682
clap... Very good...

1354
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:39,599
Please come...

1355
00:45:41,391 --> 00:45:43,557
Good, be seated

1356
00:45:45,891 --> 00:45:48,141
What is your name dear? - Sagar

1357
00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:50,974
Sagar, what is your goal?

1358
00:45:52,057 --> 00:45:54,391
My goal is to change as my dad, Sir - What?

1359
00:45:59,016 --> 00:46:01,099
You wish to become as your dad likes

1360
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:01,891
Yes Sir

1361
00:46:02,057 --> 00:46:04,599
I’ll now put ten questions to you. - Ok sir

1362
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:05,849
Question number one...

1363
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:10,682
It rained and all roads
are flowing with water.

1364
00:46:11,182 --> 00:46:14,599
You were going on that roadside
and a car went fast on that road

1365
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:17,766
Water squashed and your
white shirt got spoilt.

1366
00:46:17,891 --> 00:46:19,224
Then, your reactions

1367
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:22,516
A.. I’ll throw stone
screaming, you dirty idiot

1368
00:46:22,891 --> 00:46:27,682
B.. I’ll sit there and cry thinking
the time is bad and today is not favoring

1369
00:46:27,891 --> 00:46:32,349
C.. I’ll think should not wear white shirt
in rainy season and come on to the roads

1370
00:46:32,391 --> 00:46:38,516
D.. As this society will never change, I’ll
wear that white shirt as it as and come

1371
00:46:39,141 --> 00:46:41,932
What is your option
from these four options?

1372
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,557
Obviously option A Sir

1373
00:46:52,766 --> 00:46:54,891
- You would throw a stone
saying you dirty rascal

1374
00:46:55,099 --> 00:46:56,099
Yes sir, it is so

1375
00:46:56,349 --> 00:46:57,349
Question number 2

1376
00:46:59,307 --> 00:47:02,474
You’ve been waiting for the train.
It’s already an hour.

1377
00:47:02,641 --> 00:47:04,700
You asked the guy adjacent as
to when would the train come

1378
00:47:04,724 --> 00:47:07,099
He said it would take two more hours.

1379
00:47:07,557 --> 00:47:08,599
What’ll you do then?

1380
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:12,307
A.. I’ll go to a film as
still there is two hours

1381
00:47:12,516 --> 00:47:17,182
B.. I scold Railway department
people filthily and go home

1382
00:47:17,307 --> 00:47:21,891
Option C, there is a book shop beside and will
read buying personality development books

1383
00:47:22,057 --> 00:47:24,766
Option D,
I keep playing games on cell phone

1384
00:47:28,224 --> 00:47:29,891
I have two options sir, A and D

1385
00:47:30,516 --> 00:47:32,141
You’ll go to a film - Yes Sir

1386
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,766
If not keep playing games - Yes sir

1387
00:47:34,099 --> 00:47:35,391
Ok? - Ok sir

1388
00:47:36,682 --> 00:47:37,682
Mr. Sagar

1389
00:47:38,766 --> 00:47:40,182
No need of 10 questions for you

1390
00:47:41,182 --> 00:47:42,182
two are enough

1391
00:47:42,724 --> 00:47:44,016
Even two are not needed

1392
00:47:44,432 --> 00:47:45,557
the first one was enough

1393
00:47:46,307 --> 00:47:47,307
Look man

1394
00:47:48,141 --> 00:47:52,057
if you throw a stone screaming
you dirty rascal what will happen?

1395
00:47:52,557 --> 00:47:58,266
He will stop the car and come down from the
car. You both fight and scold each other

1396
00:47:58,391 --> 00:47:59,391
What will happen?

1397
00:47:59,432 --> 00:48:00,641
It becomes a dirty mess

1398
00:48:01,016 --> 00:48:03,141
Think positively, you are an youngster

1399
00:48:03,474 --> 00:48:06,474
You’ll come up in life only
if you think very positive

1400
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:07,599
Understand?

1401
00:48:10,766 --> 00:48:13,141
It’s very tough for guys
like you thinking negatively

1402
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,974
You know what’s the answer
of the person reaching goals?

1403
00:48:16,391 --> 00:48:19,682
C, the person choosing C
option will reach the goal.

1404
00:48:20,224 --> 00:48:22,474
How many are from you choosing C?

1405
00:48:27,182 --> 00:48:30,224
Oh, total! Very good, bring the hands down

1406
00:48:32,057 --> 00:48:35,641
Look, it’s two hours of time
waste going to a film dear

1407
00:48:36,266 --> 00:48:38,932
It’s further waste to
play games on cell phone

1408
00:48:39,099 --> 00:48:40,141
And you are very waste.

1409
00:48:42,307 --> 00:48:43,307
You are unfit.

1410
00:48:45,266 --> 00:48:48,557
You cannot reach the goal of your
father, you cannot

1411
00:49:15,307 --> 00:49:16,516
Why are you feeling so much?

1412
00:49:21,766 --> 00:49:23,182
I like my daddy very much

1413
00:49:24,432 --> 00:49:26,474
Even my dad liked me a lot in my childhood

1414
00:49:27,266 --> 00:49:31,057
But when I started going to
school, exams have started.

1415
00:49:31,724 --> 00:49:34,766
Immediately the results and all were zeroes

1416
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:39,599
Those marks used to come
as a devil blocking me and my dad

1417
00:49:40,474 --> 00:49:42,057
You know what happened once

1418
00:49:42,474 --> 00:49:46,016
My dad took me out to
teach cycling as a kid

1419
00:49:46,724 --> 00:49:47,724
Take left, left... Yes...

1420
00:49:49,891 --> 00:49:51,099
Yes, super...

1421
00:49:55,974 --> 00:49:58,266
Sir, hello
Hello Mr. Rami Reddy

1422
00:49:58,307 --> 00:49:59,641
Why are you sitting here?

1423
00:49:59,891 --> 00:50:01,516
I’m teaching my son to cycle

1424
00:50:01,807 --> 00:50:06,057
You can teach cycling to your son later
but teach him Mathematics tables first Sir

1425
00:50:06,307 --> 00:50:08,766
Has he said his marks
from second unit test?

1426
00:50:09,224 --> 00:50:12,266
Zero! What are you and what is this zero?

1427
00:50:12,891 --> 00:50:16,891
I feel ashamed Sir, concentrate
a bit on studies of your son Sir

1428
00:50:16,974 --> 00:50:20,516
When my Mathematics teacher that day
said that I am very weak in studies

1429
00:50:21,182 --> 00:50:22,849
my dad felt very insulted

1430
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:27,849
daddy

1431
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:30,599
Daddy, I got it.

1432
00:50:32,141 --> 00:50:33,141
Daddy

1433
00:50:34,307 --> 00:50:35,641
Daddy, I got it.

1434
00:50:44,016 --> 00:50:45,807
He didn’t care even when I fell down.

1435
00:50:46,432 --> 00:50:47,891
From then till now,

1436
00:50:48,682 --> 00:50:50,641
I’ve been trying to get close to him

1437
00:50:52,766 --> 00:50:55,182
Just now those questions and answers

1438
00:50:55,391 --> 00:50:58,807
when I was said cannot do what I wished...

1439
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:03,307
My whole mind went upset. I didn’t understand
anything Everything seems confused and shabby

1440
00:51:52,432 --> 00:51:53,516
Huh Sagar

1441
00:51:53,557 --> 00:51:54,099
sagar

1442
00:51:54,516 --> 00:51:55,432
Who is Sagar?

1443
00:51:55,474 --> 00:51:56,224
What happened to you?

1444
00:51:56,307 --> 00:51:57,932
Nothing sister

1445
00:51:58,224 --> 00:52:00,766
I’m reading the paper and said so in a flow

1446
00:52:01,932 --> 00:52:03,724
I transferred the money, check once

1447
00:52:04,682 --> 00:52:07,307
Ok sister, ok

1448
00:52:09,724 --> 00:52:10,891
Ok sister good night

1449
00:52:16,391 --> 00:52:22,432
Cot A+B equal to SAGAR...

1450
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:41,307
To control your feelings, draw a circle
stand in between and repeat up to ten times

1451
00:52:41,349 --> 00:52:47,391
I should not fall in love with Sagar...

1452
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:52,099
If your feelings are still not controlled,
you should write ten times imposition

1453
00:52:52,766 --> 00:52:55,141
Huh... Not 10 but I’ll write times...

1454
00:52:55,641 --> 00:53:00,391
I should not fall in love with Sagar...

1455
00:53:02,307 --> 00:53:03,307
yes

1456
00:53:04,557 --> 00:53:05,807
Yes, 100 times finish...

1457
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:29,932
Something happened...
Something unknown is happening

1458
00:53:30,057 --> 00:53:37,891
Something happened...
Something never experienced is happening

1459
00:53:38,474 --> 00:53:45,891
I feel cold in the burning sun
I am sweating in the cool weather

1460
00:53:46,474 --> 00:53:53,432
A rain has started in the heart
I feel like my life is going

1461
00:53:54,016 --> 00:54:02,016
My age is given a sweet wound
Love has called me loud

1462
00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:10,099
What is this greed and what is this love?
It’s a thirst unfilled drinking up the sea

1463
00:54:10,141 --> 00:54:17,932
Something happened...
Something unknown is happening

1464
00:54:18,057 --> 00:54:25,932
Something happened...
Something never experienced is happening

1465
00:54:25,974 --> 00:54:27,724
Two... - I should change like my dad likes

1466
00:54:27,766 --> 00:54:29,242
Three...
- I should change like my dad likes

1467
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,986
Four... - I should change like my dad likes

1468
00:54:31,016 --> 00:54:32,533
Five... - I should change like my dad likes

1469
00:54:32,557 --> 00:54:34,117
Six... - I should change like my dad likes

1470
00:54:34,141 --> 00:54:36,516
Seven, eight, nine and ten...
It’s over brother, enough now

1471
00:54:36,557 --> 00:54:38,242
Please ten more times - How
much more time brother, please?

1472
00:54:38,266 --> 00:54:40,099
Eleven...
- I should change like my dad likes

1473
00:54:44,016 --> 00:54:46,599
What is this son,
writing so for so many times?

1474
00:54:46,932 --> 00:54:48,932
Have you seen your face, how it is become?

1475
00:54:48,974 --> 00:54:53,432
I should work hard, right mom? How if I don’t work
hard? Is it any easy to change like how dad likes?

1476
00:54:58,182 --> 00:55:05,807
Like the groups of birds
reaching the eyes having dreams

1477
00:55:05,849 --> 00:55:13,474
Lakhs of thoughts drowned me like tides

1478
00:55:13,974 --> 00:55:21,849
Naughty separation is haunting me
My body is into shivering

1479
00:55:21,974 --> 00:55:29,641
My heart today is asking that it needs him
What is this surprise, just one greed

1480
00:55:29,974 --> 00:55:37,474
A naughty war is started within me

1481
00:55:37,974 --> 00:55:45,807
Peace of yesterday is finished and
a slight earth quake started in me

1482
00:55:46,224 --> 00:55:53,974
Something happened...
Something unknown is happening

1483
00:55:54,016 --> 00:56:01,849
Something happened...
Something never experienced is happening

1484
00:56:52,099 --> 00:56:59,557
Happiness in this silence has flown high

1485
00:57:00,182 --> 00:57:07,891
The tears have drowned turning as a flood

1486
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:15,682
It’s like this is not my body at all
Today is not like the day before

1487
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:23,849
I feel is this really me?
A trance has overtaken me

1488
00:57:24,099 --> 00:57:31,682
Every minute is a sweet hell
I’m seeing a new heaven in the pain

1489
00:57:32,224 --> 00:57:39,849
My blood boiled sweetly
My red lip has shivered slightly

1490
00:57:40,182 --> 00:57:47,849
Something happened...
Something unknown is happening

1491
00:57:48,307 --> 00:57:56,307
Something happened...
Something never experienced is happening

1492
00:58:09,266 --> 00:58:12,307
Sagar, I came to say an
important matter with you

1493
00:58:17,016 --> 00:58:19,224
Actually, there is nobody at home

1494
00:58:20,016 --> 00:58:22,974
I too thought to talk about
an important matter with you

1495
00:58:23,224 --> 00:58:24,599
You came by then, come

1496
00:58:25,099 --> 00:58:30,141
Where did you family members go Sagar?
It’s my aunt’s son’s marriage
I’m here as I didn’t feel like going

1497
00:58:30,516 --> 00:58:31,641
Will you have some water?

1498
00:58:31,932 --> 00:58:32,932
Thanks Sagar

1499
00:58:36,391 --> 00:58:38,974
I’ve been all the steps you’re saying

1500
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:41,641
But still, no change has come in me

1501
00:58:43,099 --> 00:58:46,266
Somehow I don’t feel all
this is correct, Dharmika

1502
00:58:52,682 --> 00:58:55,016
All written in this
books seem confused to me

1503
00:58:55,516 --> 00:58:57,891
I don’t understand at
all even after great try

1504
00:58:59,557 --> 00:59:04,599
Smile, anger and sorrow are
all basic human emotions right?

1505
00:59:04,891 --> 00:59:07,266
How is it possible to be into
positive thinking always?

1506
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:10,391
To forcibly stop these
and live like a Robo,

1507
00:59:10,641 --> 00:59:13,432
it’s like a human killing his own
freedom, right Dharmika?

1508
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,266
How can any human be happy
without having freedom?

1509
00:59:19,891 --> 00:59:21,599
It’s not possible for me Dharmika

1510
00:59:23,057 --> 00:59:25,057
I feel like I’m losing something

1511
00:59:26,766 --> 00:59:30,450
Yes, he asked what will you do when the car fellow
pours mud on you, in the class that day, right? - Yes

1512
00:59:30,474 --> 00:59:34,516
I really felt to stop that rascal,
scold dirty rascal and give a tight slap

1513
00:59:35,057 --> 00:59:36,266
Because it’s me

1514
00:59:36,849 --> 00:59:41,016
Saying no, it isn’t so
and I should take positive

1515
00:59:41,432 --> 00:59:45,182
means I feel like being like someone else

1516
00:59:46,682 --> 00:59:47,891
That is not me

1517
00:59:51,057 --> 00:59:53,432
Yes, I read a book in the night

1518
00:59:58,016 --> 00:59:59,016
Yes, it is there

1519
01:00:05,182 --> 01:00:07,141
Chapter name is waste idealness it seems

1520
01:00:07,307 --> 01:00:10,432
A dog is trying daily to cross the Lorry

1521
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:13,016
But the owner of that
Dog is controlling that

1522
01:00:13,182 --> 01:00:19,891
The neighbor says Sir, your dog is daily trying to cross
the lorry and asked why is he forcibly stopping it

1523
01:00:19,932 --> 01:00:22,812
Then the owner of the dog says,
what would get if it does that by chance?

1524
01:00:22,891 --> 01:00:29,432
A medal or name in the paper or bundles of
money and said why is this waste idealness

1525
01:00:31,182 --> 01:00:33,682
Is a dog crossing lorry, a waste idealness?

1526
01:00:34,266 --> 01:00:36,849
That dog would feel very happy
when it crosses the lorry right?

1527
01:00:37,099 --> 01:00:38,891
That too would feel happy within right?

1528
01:00:39,224 --> 01:00:41,516
Then how can that be a
waste idealness Dharmika?

1529
01:00:42,099 --> 01:00:44,016
Who are all these to say no to happiness?

1530
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:50,682
We can have all like short
term goals and long term goals

1531
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:53,391
But all these are not getting into my brain

1532
01:00:55,224 --> 01:00:56,516
May be to reach the goal

1533
01:00:57,057 --> 01:01:04,099
oh no the time is getting out, how and what is happening...
I’m not understanding anything in all this confusion

1534
01:01:04,266 --> 01:01:07,141
It’s like hitting on my
head with a huge stone

1535
01:01:07,557 --> 01:01:11,682
Is this so only for me or to everyone?

1536
01:01:13,766 --> 01:01:16,849
I’m not liking this at all - Sagar
I’m not liking

1537
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:26,932
Sagar, cool down

1538
01:01:29,807 --> 01:01:31,807
I’m frightened seeing myself

1539
01:01:34,016 --> 01:01:41,516
To change like how my dad likes, I left
friends, cricket and movies. But still...

1540
01:01:48,307 --> 01:01:52,224
Sagar, cool down Sagar
- Positive thinking, my foot!

1541
01:01:52,307 --> 01:01:55,516
Please Sagar
Time table, my foot!

1542
01:02:02,974 --> 01:02:07,016
Personality development, my foot! - Sagar

1543
01:02:09,349 --> 01:02:10,557
I’m now happy

1544
01:02:14,766 --> 01:02:17,807
Yes, I thought to change
as my dad likes right?

1545
01:02:18,516 --> 01:02:19,974
Then why am I behaving so?

1546
01:02:21,307 --> 01:02:26,891
Not getting studies and my dad
not liking... I’m a waste fellowh

1547
01:02:26,974 --> 01:02:28,182
I don’t know anything

1548
01:02:28,224 --> 01:02:30,391
Damn, my life is a waste

1549
01:02:37,474 --> 01:02:40,724
Sagar, cool down Sagar

1550
01:02:41,474 --> 01:02:42,682
Look

1551
01:03:12,141 --> 01:03:13,141
Brother...

1552
01:05:12,482 --> 01:05:15,357
Hello mom - Hey son,
where have you been all night?

1553
01:05:16,357 --> 01:05:18,191
You know how much was
your dad asking about?

1554
01:05:18,566 --> 01:05:20,524
Manage something mom, I’m coming

1555
01:05:21,816 --> 01:05:24,774
Come fast son, I’m waiting for you

1556
01:05:40,066 --> 01:05:40,982
Brother,

1557
01:05:41,066 --> 01:05:42,441
Dharmika asked to give you this

1558
01:05:42,566 --> 01:05:45,024
Who Dharmika, who is it?

1559
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:48,631
Are you going to the college for studying or
to give such letters? Don’t disturb me, go

1560
01:05:49,274 --> 01:05:53,024
Hey brother, why are you screaming
so? Stop your over acting and come down

1561
01:05:53,107 --> 01:05:55,482
I know where to come down
and where to win, go.

1562
01:05:55,566 --> 01:05:57,816
Dharmika it seems,
has she given this? This?

1563
01:06:00,357 --> 01:06:02,441
Are you any mad, throwing it so?

1564
01:06:02,482 --> 01:06:05,322
Yes, mad! Go and say that I tore
and threw what she gave without reading

1565
01:06:06,524 --> 01:06:09,066
You are not knowing what
you are doing in the frustration

1566
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:13,899
Hey, Dharmika is come for you, go and
see Say I’m studying mom, go Is it?

1567
01:06:14,274 --> 01:06:17,316
Why are you shouting so, son? She
is outside and would listen

1568
01:06:17,482 --> 01:06:21,242
What if she listens? Neha, go and say brother is
studying. Ask her never again to come home, go

1569
01:06:21,274 --> 01:06:24,357
I’ll the same as it is
Are you threatening me? Go and say

1570
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:28,648
Dharmika, why are you here?
Dad is not home and you can come in

1571
01:06:28,649 --> 01:06:30,066
No, have you given the letter?

1572
01:06:30,899 --> 01:06:33,816
I mean brother is very busy

1573
01:06:33,982 --> 01:06:35,732
and I’ll give in the evening, ok?

1574
01:06:36,024 --> 01:06:37,857
Ok! Bye - Bye

1575
01:06:39,899 --> 01:06:41,899
What, has Dharmika left?

1576
01:06:41,941 --> 01:06:44,781
You think I’m any mediator
between you?
You think I’ve got no other work?

1577
01:06:45,024 --> 01:06:47,941
Where is the love letter?
Huh, take it

1578
01:06:51,232 --> 01:06:54,649
I’ve kept a name for the relation
in between us and that’s love

1579
01:06:54,732 --> 01:06:55,732
Love

1580
01:07:04,232 --> 01:07:08,024
Hi Dharmika - Hi
Brother asked to give this

1581
01:07:10,566 --> 01:07:12,982
You and I are different.
It will not set for us

1582
01:07:13,066 --> 01:07:15,107
All this wouldn’t happen
So please

1583
01:07:15,191 --> 01:07:17,899
let’s be friends like ever.
From waste fellow Sagar

1584
01:07:19,149 --> 01:07:22,149
I need to talk with Sagar - Ok, cool

1585
01:07:37,607 --> 01:07:38,607
no for you and me...

1586
01:07:39,566 --> 01:07:41,766
I’ve got nothing in brain
than these mustache and beard

1587
01:07:42,232 --> 01:07:44,107
You’re a great beauty

1588
01:07:44,566 --> 01:07:47,816
My brain is like a pumpkin
seed and yours is like pumpkin

1589
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:50,982
I’m walking out - Sagar

1590
01:07:55,774 --> 01:07:56,982
Sagar...

1591
01:07:58,482 --> 01:07:59,607
Sagar...

1592
01:08:07,732 --> 01:08:09,892
Why are you leaving without
listening when I’m saying?

1593
01:08:10,066 --> 01:08:12,399
Say one solid reason why you don’t need me?

1594
01:08:12,691 --> 01:08:16,691
You know why? That day in the
class you gave C and I gave A as answer

1595
01:08:16,816 --> 01:08:19,176
Is there no difference between
A and C? This too is the same

1596
01:08:20,274 --> 01:08:23,107
I’m like the dog from
that waste idealness story

1597
01:08:23,316 --> 01:08:25,441
Did you not read behind
the text book in childhood?

1598
01:08:25,482 --> 01:08:28,149
It says we shouldn’t mess with
dog and dog byte is dangerous

1599
01:08:28,232 --> 01:08:29,441
I’m such a guy

1600
01:08:29,649 --> 01:08:30,857
I know Sagar

1601
01:08:31,066 --> 01:08:32,386
you will not understand saying so

1602
01:08:32,482 --> 01:08:33,899
You should be said practically

1603
01:08:34,191 --> 01:08:35,191
Come on

1604
01:08:38,191 --> 01:08:39,732
What are these practicals?

1605
01:08:40,732 --> 01:08:44,441
Now, human is coming here
from here changing gradually

1606
01:08:44,482 --> 01:08:46,274
I know and I’m still here

1607
01:08:47,024 --> 01:08:50,357
You mad fellow,
it’s not you here but it’s us

1608
01:08:52,441 --> 01:08:56,774
True Sagar, this whole society
is still here but you are there

1609
01:08:57,857 --> 01:09:02,149
You said recently that I’m here
and how did I come here so fast?

1610
01:09:02,982 --> 01:09:05,107
What I said then was a lie - Lie?

1611
01:09:05,232 --> 01:09:07,607
Actually I pretended all these days

1612
01:09:08,691 --> 01:09:10,691
Like I knew everything which I don’t know,

1613
01:09:10,732 --> 01:09:12,274
I followed everything I read

1614
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:14,680
like I had all these discipline,
obedience and respect...

1615
01:09:15,024 --> 01:09:17,191
I just pretended

1616
01:09:25,399 --> 01:09:27,566
Dharmika, shall we go and play?

1617
01:09:27,649 --> 01:09:28,232
Yes, come on

1618
01:09:28,357 --> 01:09:31,774
My dad played the main role in
the conspiracy making me pretend

1619
01:09:35,941 --> 01:09:39,066
Remember, you are wasting
too much of time with friends

1620
01:09:39,232 --> 01:09:42,482
Books are friends and friends are
books for a student, understood?

1621
01:09:43,524 --> 01:09:44,524
Take the books

1622
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:58,149
Dad, my eyes are burning - No dear

1623
01:09:58,566 --> 01:10:00,149
If you wear these spects

1624
01:10:00,399 --> 01:10:03,107
you look as an intelligent student to all

1625
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:06,107
Look, see in this mirror and you look great

1626
01:10:06,482 --> 01:10:07,524
Do your home work

1627
01:10:09,982 --> 01:10:12,607
Wow, intelligent girl

1628
01:10:16,357 --> 01:10:18,066
Another name for obedience...

1629
01:10:18,274 --> 01:10:22,232
Second major role played in
the conspiracy was my school Principal

1630
01:10:22,357 --> 01:10:26,024
Principal used to daily say in the prayer
like I am great for whole 365 days

1631
01:10:26,274 --> 01:10:28,191
All started praising me

1632
01:10:29,399 --> 01:10:31,941
I’m a role model for all
the students in school

1633
01:10:32,732 --> 01:10:35,607
I too started enjoying that fake image

1634
01:10:39,316 --> 01:10:42,191
So, the feeling that I am special in
all started developing in me

1635
01:10:42,816 --> 01:10:44,982
I was struck in the image of a good girl

1636
01:10:46,774 --> 01:10:50,566
Ok, will all those coming to Ram V Sekhar
class pretend like you did?

1637
01:10:52,024 --> 01:10:54,732
Not just them but even that
Ram V Sekhar also pretends

1638
01:10:55,357 --> 01:10:58,274
Oh no, what’s this sounding
so strange to listen?

1639
01:10:58,566 --> 01:11:00,732
Will humans on this earth be so funny?

1640
01:11:00,941 --> 01:11:02,357
It’s all an acting here Sagar

1641
01:11:02,732 --> 01:11:05,732
Those who pretend more are the
good people in this society

1642
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:13,066
You just said that you and I are different

1643
01:11:13,982 --> 01:11:15,774
No, yours and mine is the same story

1644
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:21,441
All these days I lived with a fake
image amongst the fake people

1645
01:11:22,149 --> 01:11:26,691
Now, I wish to live in reality with you

1646
01:11:26,816 --> 01:11:32,441
When the flowers just
waking up are getting active

1647
01:11:32,482 --> 01:11:37,482
Honey bees are landing over the pollen

1648
01:11:37,816 --> 01:11:43,357
The cool breeze from the
branches massaged all my body

1649
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:48,191
I have changed like the
butterfly opening wings

1650
01:11:48,857 --> 01:11:54,274
Nature called me to ride a swing in its lap

1651
01:11:54,316 --> 01:11:59,857
I came to know today that
I dreamt myself as the Sea

1652
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:05,191
Why will that Sky give a
shade like an umbrella?

1653
01:12:05,441 --> 01:12:10,857
Why is this earth carrying me for so long?

1654
01:12:11,024 --> 01:12:16,482
Why have these fire and water
developed bonding with me?

1655
01:12:16,524 --> 01:12:22,274
Why has your story come
and mixed so into my story?

1656
01:12:22,357 --> 01:12:26,899
Yours and mine is the same story

1657
01:12:27,024 --> 01:12:29,649
Yours and mine is the same story

1658
01:12:29,732 --> 01:12:32,941
So, you say to write exams
for your father right?

1659
01:12:33,441 --> 01:12:35,482
Yes - Will you pass then?

1660
01:12:37,691 --> 01:12:39,441
Why to write exams then?

1661
01:12:42,732 --> 01:12:43,774
What shall I do then?

1662
01:12:43,899 --> 01:12:46,816
Go and directly say your dad
that you can’t write the exams

1663
01:12:48,607 --> 01:12:50,316
Will that be good if I say so?

1664
01:12:50,524 --> 01:12:54,024
Who would say no when you loyally
say what you feel at heart?

1665
01:13:03,024 --> 01:13:07,357
Daddy... - Hey, bring Grandpa’s photo.
We shall fix it inside on the wall

1666
01:13:14,524 --> 01:13:17,941
I’ve been waiting from 10 in the
morning to fix this if you come

1667
01:13:18,316 --> 01:13:22,607
It’s six in the evening now. Oh no,
I wouldn’t have gone out if I knew that dad

1668
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:25,107
Why couldn’t you call
some neighborhood uncle?

1669
01:13:25,357 --> 01:13:26,441
Yes, I can call

1670
01:13:26,774 --> 01:13:30,566
I can call uncle neighboring,
Ramarao from here and Subbarao from there

1671
01:13:31,274 --> 01:13:34,774
But all of them get one single
question after seeing my face

1672
01:13:35,107 --> 01:13:38,649
It is how many more subjects are in balance
for your son and will he pass at least now

1673
01:13:38,732 --> 01:13:41,149
What shall I answer?
I should see with a pale face

1674
01:13:43,357 --> 01:13:46,274
My ears are going numb
listening to all these words

1675
01:13:46,607 --> 01:13:49,191
Concentrate at least this time
and pass those two subjects, son

1676
01:13:49,441 --> 01:13:53,024
Dad that is, I thought to talk
about this matter myself with you

1677
01:13:53,441 --> 01:13:57,357
And you started it by then.
I wish not to write exams anymore now
Exams...

1678
01:13:58,191 --> 01:14:01,191
I mean, don’t want to write any more

1679
01:14:07,274 --> 01:14:08,316
What happened?

1680
01:14:09,482 --> 01:14:16,731
I mean dad, you know and I know I’ll anyways not
pass even if I write repeatedly and thus...

1681
01:14:16,732 --> 01:14:18,232
It’s good son, great

1682
01:14:19,149 --> 01:14:22,691
Have you heard, what your cute
son the great Sagar is saying?

1683
01:14:23,649 --> 01:14:24,691
What happened hubby,

1684
01:14:25,107 --> 01:14:28,191
why so much anger? - Ask him why

1685
01:14:28,691 --> 01:14:32,941
Sir will not write exams anymore now because
he came to know in advance that he would fail

1686
01:14:33,399 --> 01:14:36,524
He is indirectly saying to stop
studies now. Is it so, Sir?

1687
01:14:37,232 --> 01:14:39,899
Ok, you’ll give up studies
and what’ll you do?

1688
01:14:40,691 --> 01:14:41,941
What’ll you do?

1689
01:14:42,107 --> 01:14:44,649
Say son, dad is asking right?

1690
01:14:45,024 --> 01:14:47,774
Say what you are thinking
to do giving up your studies

1691
01:14:48,024 --> 01:14:52,357
I thought to give up studies but
haven’t still thought what to do

1692
01:14:52,774 --> 01:14:56,316
Oh, you didn’t think of anything
and this is further great

1693
01:14:56,566 --> 01:14:59,982
You don’t know what to do but
have decided to give up studies

1694
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:03,482
First, I wished to see
you as University first

1695
01:15:03,691 --> 01:15:05,571
Later I felt enough that
you come College first

1696
01:15:05,774 --> 01:15:07,816
Then I felt enough if you pass the exam

1697
01:15:07,982 --> 01:15:10,382
nd now I’m into a situation
thinking enough if you write exam

1698
01:15:11,149 --> 01:15:13,149
Seeing me in this situation, I feel

1699
01:15:15,857 --> 01:15:17,107
What’s this son?

1700
01:15:17,191 --> 01:15:18,857
This education is not ok now for me mom

1701
01:15:19,732 --> 01:15:21,399
Hey, place your hand on the heart and say

1702
01:15:21,691 --> 01:15:23,651
Have you ever thought
about us even for a second?

1703
01:15:24,274 --> 01:15:26,234
Have you ever thought
about us even for a second?

1704
01:15:36,649 --> 01:15:40,316
Have you ever thought
about us even for a second?

1705
01:15:59,191 --> 01:16:00,316
Has the paper come?

1706
01:16:00,774 --> 01:16:02,191
I’ve put it somewhere there, see

1707
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:03,649
Will you have a coffee or tea?

1708
01:16:03,691 --> 01:16:04,691
Anything is ok

1709
01:16:16,399 --> 01:16:17,441
Dad.... - Yes

1710
01:16:22,774 --> 01:16:23,524
What’s this son?

1711
01:16:23,607 --> 01:16:26,482
You asked what’ll I do
giving up studies right?

1712
01:16:26,691 --> 01:16:29,899
I wrote a list of what all I can do?
I can do anything from these

1713
01:16:33,024 --> 01:16:39,857
Cell point, Pan shop, Mechanic Shed,
Assistant director in the film industry

1714
01:16:40,649 --> 01:16:43,524
You can even beg on the roads

1715
01:16:55,816 --> 01:16:58,149
Will you do such works
for life long and live?

1716
01:17:11,677 --> 01:17:14,344
Ok, will you write exams
just for this time?

1717
01:17:16,219 --> 01:17:23,469
No! These exams, my dad, house and society...
I feel like running away from these Dharmika

1718
01:17:23,927 --> 01:17:25,219
Have you seen Geethanjali film?

1719
01:17:25,636 --> 01:17:29,677
Nagarjuna goes away to Ooty after
knowing that he has cancer right to die?

1720
01:17:30,302 --> 01:17:32,177
I too wish to run away somewhere similarly

1721
01:17:40,636 --> 01:17:44,386
You in me and me in you - Sagar

1722
01:17:44,552 --> 01:17:46,912
We became eyes for the carrying earth
Come, we’ll go - where

1723
01:17:47,344 --> 01:17:49,011
Come on, I’ll say

1724
01:17:50,511 --> 01:17:51,802
Where? - Ooty

1725
01:17:52,802 --> 01:17:54,302
I just said for fun

1726
01:17:54,344 --> 01:17:56,344
I'm saying seriously

1727
01:17:56,386 --> 01:17:58,177
The breeze flowing and
the garden blossoming

1728
01:17:58,261 --> 01:18:00,552
No, it’s uncomfortable for me

1729
01:18:01,052 --> 01:18:03,719
Go and write your exams

1730
01:18:08,636 --> 01:18:16,636
Those butterflies and these
snow heaps get us together

1731
01:18:16,677 --> 01:18:24,594
That bitter time is gone and
the prison life will go, see

1732
01:18:24,636 --> 01:18:32,636
Closing day and rising happiness,
my body is not permanent

1733
01:18:33,094 --> 01:18:40,594
Dear, my breathe has come back
like the songs from the birds

1734
01:18:40,636 --> 01:18:48,636
You in me and me in you have
become eyes for the carrying earth

1735
01:18:55,177 --> 01:18:58,011
Shall we get up early tomorrow
and go for seeing Sunrise

1736
01:19:22,969 --> 01:19:30,802
Do you know whether the fish
swimming in pond feels thirsty?

1737
01:19:30,969 --> 01:19:38,761
Do you whether the swan
flying in the sky gets dirty?

1738
01:19:38,802 --> 01:19:46,802
Though there are so many valleys, whatever society
says and so much of sorrows, will the time change?

1739
01:19:46,969 --> 01:19:54,469
Though others say anything or
whatever happens, I’ll be with you

1740
01:19:55,136 --> 01:20:03,094
That speaking parrot and the moon smiling and
my shape is the freedom like the flying sparrow

1741
01:20:03,136 --> 01:20:10,594
On the ruling sky if I’m like
you, life is a war

1742
01:20:10,636 --> 01:20:18,636
You in me and me in you
have become eyes for the carrying earth
What?

1743
01:20:50,802 --> 01:20:52,094
What?

1744
01:20:53,469 --> 01:20:54,969
We’ll stay right here, Sagar?

1745
01:20:58,177 --> 01:20:59,177
Come on, I’ll say

1746
01:21:01,761 --> 01:21:07,302
Now if you go home, your dad will ask where did you
go leaving out the exams It would make a big fight

1747
01:21:07,844 --> 01:21:11,594
and you’ll sit whole
night feeling bad
Say, is this all required?

1748
01:21:12,052 --> 01:21:13,052
No way out, right?

1749
01:21:13,094 --> 01:21:16,511
Why is your dad not agreeing when you are
saying to live doing the work you know?

1750
01:21:19,511 --> 01:21:22,552
Because he fears to lose
his prestige in the society

1751
01:21:23,886 --> 01:21:29,136
Your dad feels ashamed to be said that son
of Deviprasad is working in a textile shop

1752
01:21:29,761 --> 01:21:32,011
So, there is only one way out from this

1753
01:21:32,761 --> 01:21:35,177
It is for you to come out of the house
Coming out and...

1754
01:21:36,177 --> 01:21:38,469
Coming out and keep doing what you know

1755
01:21:39,136 --> 01:21:40,469
It’s wrong to do so right?

1756
01:21:42,011 --> 01:21:46,636
No, it’s not wrong to let go
anything which is not happy for you

1757
01:21:47,886 --> 01:21:49,486
So, we shall look for a house right here

1758
01:21:50,011 --> 01:21:51,552
None will know where we are

1759
01:21:52,469 --> 01:21:54,636
Let’s both do a job each and live happily

1760
01:21:55,719 --> 01:21:58,052
It’s great listening to when you are saying

1761
01:21:58,552 --> 01:22:01,469
No Dharmika, let’s leave..
Your attention please

1762
01:22:01,594 --> 01:22:09,594
come Train number 17229 Sabari Express
is ready to depart from platform number 1

1763
01:22:10,677 --> 01:22:11,677
Come, let us go

1764
01:22:23,719 --> 01:22:24,719
bye

1765
01:22:32,094 --> 01:22:33,094
Where did you go?

1766
01:22:33,677 --> 01:22:34,677
When did you come?

1767
01:22:34,927 --> 01:22:37,677
I had a small work and stayed
at Harika’s house in the night

1768
01:22:37,969 --> 01:22:38,969
What is this bag then?

1769
01:22:39,511 --> 01:22:43,677
As our washing machine is not working good,
I washed at their house and am coming

1770
01:22:44,094 --> 01:22:45,302
Ok, go and freshen up

1771
01:22:48,177 --> 01:22:52,677
Hey Dharmika, you forgot your handbag
in the auto. This is Ooty special...

1772
01:23:01,261 --> 01:23:02,302
Nice meeting you

1773
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:12,136
You’ve so ruined idiot, you lie to me.
No shame at all

1774
01:23:17,094 --> 01:23:18,219
What, crying?

1775
01:23:18,594 --> 01:23:19,969
You are acting so innocent

1776
01:23:20,136 --> 01:23:23,376
I thought you were studying here hbut never
thought you are doing such things here

1777
01:23:24,386 --> 01:23:26,927
Sister-in-law,
Dharmika has no mistake in this

1778
01:23:26,969 --> 01:23:29,969
Even when she said no and sister
would scold, I forced and took her

1779
01:23:30,427 --> 01:23:32,969
Who are you rascal,
to force and take my sister?

1780
01:23:34,677 --> 01:23:38,761
You idiot, saying so openly? You take
my sister, who do you think she is?

1781
01:23:38,927 --> 01:23:41,219
Swapnika’s sister Dharmika! Get out

1782
01:23:41,927 --> 01:23:44,052
What get out? We are in love

1783
01:23:47,427 --> 01:23:51,136
We’ve been to see Ooty and that’s all. No
mistake has happened there like you think

1784
01:23:51,177 --> 01:23:53,969
You think it’s all over or what?
We are very pure

1785
01:23:54,011 --> 01:23:57,261
Hey, did I say what I’m thinking
to you? Did I say, did I say at all?

1786
01:23:57,761 --> 01:23:58,802
Bloody fool, go off

1787
01:23:59,594 --> 01:24:02,927
You take no tensions. I’ll send mom
and sister and they’ll talk about the match

1788
01:24:03,011 --> 01:24:04,094
You come inside idiot

1789
01:24:07,302 --> 01:24:11,302
We both are wishing to get married
What, thinking to get married?

1790
01:24:12,052 --> 01:24:14,677
Is he your class mate? - No
Which College?

1791
01:24:15,802 --> 01:24:16,844
What’s he studying?

1792
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:20,636
Oh, is he not studying?

1793
01:24:20,802 --> 01:24:22,136
Though he didn’t study well

1794
01:24:22,302 --> 01:24:24,862
he’s far better than you and me too
In which matter is he better?

1795
01:24:25,052 --> 01:24:28,511
Did he say to wash clothes and cook?
What does he have with him?

1796
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:32,344
Neither you nor I and half of
the society have what he has

1797
01:24:33,386 --> 01:24:34,136
what’s that?

1798
01:24:34,344 --> 01:24:36,011
Loyalty and Sincerity!

1799
01:24:36,261 --> 01:24:40,094
We’ll show up like to know what all
we don’t know and live pretending

1800
01:24:40,261 --> 01:24:43,219
He will not pretend so.
He is an original man

1801
01:24:44,511 --> 01:24:51,511
I’ll say one thing, listen. I’ll be quiet for anything but
never when you say to marry a guy who is not settled in life

1802
01:25:06,469 --> 01:25:08,344
What’s Sir thinking to do?

1803
01:25:09,052 --> 01:25:10,344
Say something

1804
01:25:11,719 --> 01:25:16,011
That is dad... I gave the list
and you give a confirmation...

1805
01:25:16,052 --> 01:25:17,732
Your dad will not speak with you, it seems

1806
01:25:22,511 --> 01:25:25,636
Going away from house when harshly
spoken and coming back after two days

1807
01:25:26,261 --> 01:25:29,386
Is this any public chowltry to come
and leave as and you when wish?

1808
01:25:30,052 --> 01:25:33,344
It’s all his wish, either not to
study and even to stop studies

1809
01:25:34,344 --> 01:25:37,844
Cleverly going away from home
on the exam day, we are all mad people here

1810
01:25:38,219 --> 01:25:42,052
I’m saying again, life is not as easy to play
cricket with dirty batch going to the ground

1811
01:25:42,469 --> 01:25:45,011
Still, will he beg on roads
in future without settling?

1812
01:25:46,802 --> 01:25:50,511
Come on, how can he be without any ego, shame,
fear or worry not to be having a settlement?

1813
01:25:53,802 --> 01:25:55,927
Hey, what are you thinking?
What are you thinking?

1814
01:25:57,136 --> 01:25:59,844
What dad, always asking what I am thinking

1815
01:26:00,011 --> 01:26:02,386
What’s here to think? Do I know anything?

1816
01:26:02,844 --> 01:26:04,677
What idiot, why is the voice raising?

1817
01:26:06,552 --> 01:26:11,427
I’ve been screaming to settle and don’t you
think why and what are they saying to you?

1818
01:26:11,761 --> 01:26:13,052
Not that, what I say is...

1819
01:26:13,094 --> 01:26:13,636
What not?

1820
01:26:13,886 --> 01:26:15,326
Why are saying opposite to dad, son?

1821
01:26:15,427 --> 01:26:19,052
No consideration to elders...
You’ll go ruined with no settlement in life

1822
01:26:19,177 --> 01:26:20,969
Oh no, he is into anger again

1823
01:26:21,011 --> 01:26:24,469
If you have so much anger, settle in
hlife and show me. Not to shout again.

1824
01:26:24,802 --> 01:26:31,261
Every waste idiot knows this to raise the voice.
No respect on elders and no discipline, damn it

1825
01:26:31,386 --> 01:26:32,677
Come on, leave him hubby

1826
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:33,959
What to leave, you dirty rascal

1827
01:26:34,136 --> 01:26:36,927
Your son is got the same brains as
you, waste fellows

1828
01:26:42,011 --> 01:26:43,011
sagar

1829
01:26:50,886 --> 01:26:54,302
Hey bro, how is your life?
Life is in rising bro

1830
01:26:54,386 --> 01:26:56,153
take this sweet first and
I’ll say the real matter

1831
01:26:56,177 --> 01:26:57,927
What, is it your birthday?

1832
01:26:58,052 --> 01:27:00,302
No bro, more important than that.
I got a job

1833
01:27:03,052 --> 01:27:04,052
Congrats brother

1834
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:05,886
Thanks brother

1835
01:27:06,261 --> 01:27:07,261
Six Lakhs package

1836
01:27:07,594 --> 01:27:09,386
They gave placement in Chennai
Super...

1837
01:27:09,677 --> 01:27:11,469
Come, we shall talk sipping Tea

1838
01:27:12,927 --> 01:27:14,886
I think your father is
full happy at home right?

1839
01:27:15,219 --> 01:27:17,177
Yes mom, dad and we are all full happy

1840
01:27:17,511 --> 01:27:19,886
Dad called his friends yesterday
and is given a party too

1841
01:27:19,969 --> 01:27:22,070
Mom is done the prayers and
worship to Lord Satyanarayana

1842
01:27:22,094 --> 01:27:27,344
Good, for you to have let go minor happiness in
childhood and studying hard, a good result is come up

1843
01:27:27,594 --> 01:27:28,714
Yes brother, I am very happy

1844
01:27:29,761 --> 01:27:32,552
How much it? - I’ll give brother
No problem brother, I’ll pay

1845
01:27:32,969 --> 01:27:34,249
You can give after you get a job

1846
01:27:36,969 --> 01:27:40,552
Oh, it’s nine.
Bro, I’m getting late and I’ll leave - Ok

1847
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:49,052
Even my sister is saying the same.
Settlement, settlement!

1848
01:27:50,469 --> 01:27:54,219
She is making nonsense saying will
I beg marrying a guy not settled

1849
01:28:00,011 --> 01:28:05,761
No idea what this settlement is and what
this nonsense is, my head is going rounds

1850
01:28:07,552 --> 01:28:09,552
Settlement means a standard job

1851
01:28:11,177 --> 01:28:14,469
Government job once and
now the software jobs

1852
01:28:16,052 --> 01:28:19,886
It’s like you are settled in life earning
35000 per month and not settle if no

1853
01:28:20,594 --> 01:28:22,677
Still, should all get settled?

1854
01:28:23,261 --> 01:28:26,636
What, 35000? My face has no such scene bro.

1855
01:28:27,386 --> 01:28:29,886
Still, should all get settled?

1856
01:28:29,927 --> 01:28:31,427
Blindly should settle

1857
01:28:34,344 --> 01:28:41,219
Though you’re a very good guy, if not
settled in life, you are a waste fellow

1858
01:28:45,552 --> 01:28:48,677
Coming to your dad now,
he is now crossed 50 years of age

1859
01:28:49,886 --> 01:28:53,719
Our colony people till date gave
great respect to him - Yes brother

1860
01:28:54,177 --> 01:28:58,052
It was my dad saying all about the uses
from education, right? - Yes

1861
01:28:59,177 --> 01:29:02,511
Thus all feel about him as a great wizard

1862
01:29:02,844 --> 01:29:04,484
But what the public think of him is wrong

1863
01:29:05,302 --> 01:29:08,511
Even your dad like all
is living in a fake image

1864
01:29:09,136 --> 01:29:12,219
And thus he cannot bear
when you say cannot settle

1865
01:29:12,969 --> 01:29:19,386
To say in a word your dad is more worried
about his status and prestige than you

1866
01:29:19,719 --> 01:29:23,719
So, you have to settle at any cost

1867
01:29:25,052 --> 01:29:27,052
Come out of the house and
live as you like brother

1868
01:29:27,302 --> 01:29:28,302
Hey Sagar

1869
01:29:29,427 --> 01:29:30,427
sagar

1870
01:29:31,469 --> 01:29:32,469
what happened?

1871
01:29:32,802 --> 01:29:33,802
Where are you going?

1872
01:29:35,386 --> 01:29:38,219
What, my dad has no love on me?

1873
01:29:38,594 --> 01:29:40,219
Are status and prestige more than me?

1874
01:29:40,677 --> 01:29:42,469
Has he any peeped in from my house window?

1875
01:29:45,261 --> 01:29:49,261
I came in a frustration as he would say
about settlement and that too as you said

1876
01:29:51,802 --> 01:29:52,844
Not that Dharmika,

1877
01:29:53,177 --> 01:29:54,594
why would even my dad say?

1878
01:29:54,969 --> 01:29:57,427
It’s for my good and that
I should get better right?

1879
01:30:14,741 --> 01:30:15,741
Sagar bro

1880
01:30:15,824 --> 01:30:17,782
come... Looks like you are going somewhere

1881
01:30:17,866 --> 01:30:18,907
Need the bike?

1882
01:30:19,074 --> 01:30:21,532
Nothing, just came to talk with you

1883
01:30:25,741 --> 01:30:28,282
Yes Shiva, how much do you earn a month?

1884
01:30:28,491 --> 01:30:29,866
I earn around 10000 a month bro

1885
01:30:30,449 --> 01:30:32,657
You are married and is that enough?

1886
01:30:33,532 --> 01:30:35,991
I am now staying in a small
house beside bus stand bro

1887
01:30:36,366 --> 01:30:38,241
Two rooms and 3000 per month

1888
01:30:38,449 --> 01:30:41,407
Son is into Government school and
one movie per month is compulsory

1889
01:30:41,616 --> 01:30:43,949
I save 2000 after all the expenses

1890
01:30:44,032 --> 01:30:47,241
I give that to my wife and
she saves in Dwakra group

1891
01:30:47,282 --> 01:30:49,522
That is all, what more bro?
Just bend the bike a bit bro

1892
01:30:52,282 --> 01:30:53,282
Yes Shiva,

1893
01:30:53,449 --> 01:30:55,782
did you ever feel bad that
you didn’t settle in life?

1894
01:30:55,824 --> 01:30:59,032
What more to settle bro, I’m happy right?
My life is good

1895
01:30:59,241 --> 01:31:01,824
I can’t do any other work than this bro

1896
01:31:02,032 --> 01:31:04,491
Still, that thrill in doing
what we like is different bro

1897
01:31:05,991 --> 01:31:09,199
Not in running the Pan shop
but happiness is in making it

1898
01:31:09,532 --> 01:31:10,616
Same for me too bro

1899
01:31:10,907 --> 01:31:13,949
not in putting the tea shop but
happiness is in giving the tea

1900
01:31:15,657 --> 01:31:19,782
Every work so will have an art
and a satisfaction to the heart

1901
01:31:23,116 --> 01:31:24,574
Come, we shall sit and talk

1902
01:31:27,032 --> 01:31:29,116
Yes, what more?

1903
01:31:29,616 --> 01:31:32,324
Ok, how is your driving life bro?
Super bro

1904
01:31:32,449 --> 01:31:34,199
kick in long driving is different

1905
01:31:34,366 --> 01:31:39,616
I and my Sir day before went to Madras
Shooting of
Rajinikanth’s son-in-law Dhanush in Madras

1906
01:31:39,824 --> 01:31:41,824
My Sir has a good friendship
with that producer

1907
01:31:42,074 --> 01:31:44,741
Samantha is the heroine in that
and I took photos too. See!

1908
01:31:47,074 --> 01:31:50,532
Brother - Yes Did you ever feel it
would have been good if settled in life?

1909
01:31:51,782 --> 01:31:54,782
Settlement? - Yes
What does that mean bro?

1910
01:32:04,782 --> 01:32:07,866
Have you ever felt bad
for not earning money?

1911
01:32:07,991 --> 01:32:11,616
Look son, there are only
two pathos in this world

1912
01:32:11,991 --> 01:32:13,907
One is not to have money

1913
01:32:14,491 --> 01:32:15,866
and the other to have money

1914
01:32:16,532 --> 01:32:20,366
Sorrow is common to human here
either there is money or not

1915
01:32:26,074 --> 01:32:28,032
Thus I never care about the money

1916
01:32:28,866 --> 01:32:31,241
Life is to be happy

1917
01:32:31,491 --> 01:32:33,782
Life is to be happy

1918
01:33:03,157 --> 01:33:03,741
Who are these Son?

1919
01:33:03,824 --> 01:33:05,866
Dad, he is Yakub and runs a Pan shop

1920
01:33:05,949 --> 01:33:07,782
He is Nagulu grandpa selling coconuts

1921
01:33:07,991 --> 01:33:09,491
this Sreenu bro works as a driver

1922
01:33:09,616 --> 01:33:11,696
You know this Shiva right,
Mechanic Shiva. Say Shiva

1923
01:33:12,116 --> 01:33:12,907

1924

Come on, as you said some urgent work I
came closing the shed and what is this bro?

1926
01:33:19,824 --> 01:33:22,467
You’re happy in life though you haven’t
settled right? Say that to my dad please

1927
01:33:22,491 --> 01:33:24,217
What is this bro,

I like him a lot sir.

1933
01:33:33,407 --> 01:33:35,657
I am saying as he asked to say.

They got you forcibly study though you didn’t
like, your friend became a supervisor...

01:33:58,282 --> 01:34:00,116
I said that in a flow
Remember that

1940
01:34:00,199 --> 01:34:02,157
I can’t remember Ok, go to a side and think

1941
01:34:02,199 --> 01:34:04,907
Grandpa, at least you say.
My dad is not understanding

1942
01:34:05,699 --> 01:34:09,241
Sir, I don’t know who this boy is.
I don’t know who you are

1943
01:34:09,407 --> 01:34:11,217
Say grandpa - I understood
after coming here Sir

1944
01:34:11,241 --> 01:34:14,574
Say grandpa - That this boy is
very eager to say something to you

1945
01:34:14,657 --> 01:34:18,824
Sir, I sell 100 coconuts
everyday and earn 400.

1946
01:34:19,116 --> 01:34:25,866
In unseason I sell fruits like guava, banana and
all as per the season and I earn 15000 a month Sir

1947
01:34:26,199 --> 01:34:29,074

1948
01:34:29,366 --> 01:34:31,116
That is all Enough Son
Thanks grandpa

1949
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:37,157
Come on, is this any film story to
say always? Go dude, you seem to be crazy

1950
01:34:37,491 --> 01:34:38,907
You made me lose all my deals today

1951
01:34:38,949 --> 01:34:40,592
I thought there is some
function when you called me home

1952
01:34:40,616 --> 01:34:43,717
What is this mess? - You were till now
right bro? I’ll give all the money you lost

1953
01:34:43,741 --> 01:34:45,657
Please say bro - Go dude

I understood what he is saying
and let him go - Understood dad?

1968
01:35:23,574 --> 01:35:25,855
Thank God, I brought all these
that you should understood

1969
01:35:26,074 --> 01:35:30,241
So, you threatened and brought all these and want
to prove that what you said is right and I’m wrong

1970
01:35:30,324 --> 01:35:35,157
Oh no, what to threaten dad? They
really didn’t know till they came here dad

1971
01:35:35,532 --> 01:35:39,366
Hey, not a hundred but even
if you bring a Lakh as such

1972
01:35:39,866 --> 01:35:42,706
I’ll never believe that someone would
be happy in life without settling

1973
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:44,657
You said understood, right dad?

1974
01:35:44,866 --> 01:35:49,699
Hey, hit.... Hit and make me
agree that you are correct

1975
01:35:50,366 --> 01:35:51,907
Oh no, what is hitting you dad?

1976
01:35:51,949 --> 01:35:53,282
Why not? Hit...

1977
01:35:53,324 --> 01:35:57,366
Sir, poor fellow looks to
have been in great worry sir

1978
01:35:57,574 --> 01:35:59,449
Get a pan shop put up even for your son

1979
01:35:59,699 --> 01:36:01,299
There is a good place in the next street

1980
01:36:01,491 --> 01:36:03,241
If needed, I’ll get you the daily finance

1981
01:36:03,282 --> 01:36:04,491
Hey, go idiot

1982
01:36:04,907 --> 01:36:06,987
Should even my son live
running a Pan shop like you?

1983
01:36:07,032 --> 01:36:09,491
Is even a pan shop life too a life?
Go away idiot

1984
01:36:09,949 --> 01:36:12,309
What is this sir,
hitting after calling home? - Go, get out

1985
01:36:12,449 --> 01:36:14,699
Srinu bro, come... What a great family bro

1986
01:36:14,741 --> 01:36:16,061
What’s wrong in what he said dad?

1987
01:36:16,157 --> 01:36:17,637
Is life of a pan shop guy not a life?

1988
01:36:17,782 --> 01:36:19,302
S life of a coconut seller not a life?

1989
01:36:19,574 --> 01:36:21,782
Is life of a Mechanic
and a driver not a life?

1990
01:36:21,949 --> 01:36:25,229
Why, are only lives of lecturer like you,
Doctors and Engineers are the only lives?

1991
01:36:26,532 --> 01:36:27,532
You’ll not change, idiot

1992
01:36:27,741 --> 01:36:29,941
When the whole world takes a
way, you go in another way

1993
01:36:30,116 --> 01:36:32,436
It’s a waste for you to live,
go and die jumping somewhere

1994
01:36:57,282 --> 01:37:00,991
Careful - Hold properly - Tight

1995
01:37:01,032 --> 01:37:06,324
Move - Move a bit that side leave

1996
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:15,991
What happened Sir?

1997
01:37:16,074 --> 01:37:17,074
Someone named Sravan

1998
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:18,842
fell under the train and died
Is it a suicide?

1999
01:37:18,866 --> 01:37:21,342
No, fell under the train while
catching the running train and died

2000
01:37:21,366 --> 01:37:23,842
He is become into pieces. Poor fellow has
recently got a job in Chennai it seems

2001
01:37:23,866 --> 01:37:28,116
It happened so when he was going to join. What
is the use studying so hard and getting a job?

2002
01:38:02,282 --> 01:38:06,199
Move, move please

2003
01:38:06,241 --> 01:38:11,741
Move, move please

2004
01:38:18,032 --> 01:38:21,532
Move, move please

2005
01:38:23,157 --> 01:38:26,741
I’ll get into IIT in
future and settle in life.

2006
01:38:27,032 --> 01:38:29,074
I got seat in IIT and studying in NIT

2007
01:38:29,449 --> 01:38:32,741
If we correctly follow his ideology,
it’s like we reached our goal

2008
01:38:33,074 --> 01:38:35,074
I got a job, six Lakhs is the package

2009
01:38:35,199 --> 01:38:42,574
Daily life is a drama...

2010
01:38:51,407 --> 01:38:58,366
Daily life is a drama...

2011
01:38:59,282 --> 01:39:06,657
What we finally see is the penance

2012
01:39:06,699 --> 01:39:14,157
What we finally see is the penance

2013
01:39:14,657 --> 01:39:21,699
Daily life is a drama...

2014
01:39:37,657 --> 01:39:40,074
Settlement? - Yes - What is that bro?

2015
01:39:40,324 --> 01:39:42,741
Still, the thrill in doing
what we like is different bro

2016
01:39:43,116 --> 01:39:46,949
Every work so will have an art
and a satisfaction to the heart

2017
01:39:47,282 --> 01:39:49,491
Life is to be happy

2018
01:39:49,616 --> 01:39:57,616
To be born is true and to die is
true, the life in between is a drama

2019
01:40:12,282 --> 01:40:14,032
Study 20 hours a day,

2020
01:40:14,699 --> 01:40:22,532
put aside small pleasures to reach your goals
in life Own a permanent happiness in future

2021
01:40:23,699 --> 01:40:30,282
Now I’ll say about power of intention
in a song form and you should repeat that

2022
01:40:30,616 --> 01:40:34,657
Frogs in the well - Frogs in the well

2023
01:40:34,699 --> 01:40:38,949
Sir, sit there -
Four frogs - Four frogs

2024
01:40:38,991 --> 01:40:42,907
They are dancing and doing disco
- They are dancing and doing disco

2025
01:40:42,949 --> 01:40:47,491
They are dancing and doing disco -
They are dancing and doing disco

2026
01:40:48,116 --> 01:40:50,449
Can I ask you a question? -
Please ask my dear

2027
01:40:50,824 --> 01:40:54,324
What will you do if I hit you
tight with my left slipper?

2028
01:40:55,324 --> 01:40:58,407
Option A, you hit saying dirty rascal

2029
01:40:59,282 --> 01:41:01,782
Option B, you give a Police complaint

2030
01:41:02,699 --> 01:41:05,491
Option C, you think positively and leave me

2031
01:41:06,366 --> 01:41:09,616
Option C - You think
positive and leave me dear?

2032
01:41:09,741 --> 01:41:10,282
Yes

2033
01:41:10,657 --> 01:41:15,616
Not just me dear, anyone in this
world would think positive like me

2034
01:41:18,907 --> 01:41:21,282
Hey, what are you doing?

2035
01:41:23,032 --> 01:41:24,448
Hey stop, hold him

2036
01:41:24,449 --> 01:41:27,241
My dear, listen to me and leave

2037
01:41:27,324 --> 01:41:28,758
What is you saying and we listening?

2038
01:41:28,782 --> 01:41:32,449
You cheat, public are getting
ruined listening to what you said

2039
01:41:32,491 --> 01:41:37,866
He died without living in peace and happiness for a
second because of your saying of settlement in life

2040
01:41:37,907 --> 01:41:39,991
He lost all his minute pleasures.

2041
01:41:40,241 --> 01:41:44,157
What is your nonsense in this dirty life
when we don’t know about death?

2042
01:41:44,199 --> 01:41:45,282
You Psycho bugger!

2043
01:41:45,366 --> 01:41:49,907
Hey Security, pull that idiot out.
Break his limbs - Hey, you are a mad fellow

2044
01:41:49,991 --> 01:41:52,258
Being mad, why are you driving
all public mad? Pull him out

2045
01:41:52,282 --> 01:41:56,866
Hey, if you have the guts follow
what all you say sincerely and prove

2046
01:42:24,991 --> 01:42:26,282
I felt not to come, son

2047
01:42:28,241 --> 01:42:29,616
But how can I be without coming?

2048
01:42:31,616 --> 01:42:35,907
Don’t think I don’t like you. I like you.

2049
01:42:38,657 --> 01:42:41,366
I suffered you without understanding you

2050
01:42:43,116 --> 01:42:46,574
Select anything from the list
you wrote and I have no objection

2051
01:42:47,741 --> 01:42:48,949
It’s enough that you are happy

2052
01:43:03,324 --> 01:43:05,199
Hey, will you eat Idli son?

2053
01:43:07,949 --> 01:43:08,949
Where is dad, mom?

2054
01:43:12,324 --> 01:43:13,324
Has he not come, mom?

2055
01:43:13,782 --> 01:43:16,157
He went saying has some
meeting in town hall

2056
01:43:16,491 --> 01:43:17,491
He would bn the way.

2057
01:43:17,699 --> 01:43:20,241
Why will he not come,
when you are in such a state?

2058
01:43:20,991 --> 01:43:22,191
I will call and find out, wait

2059
01:43:41,950 --> 01:43:45,950
You know how many times has
he asked whether dad has come?

2060
01:43:48,617 --> 01:43:50,700
How bad would he have felt at heart?

2061
01:43:53,242 --> 01:43:56,742
Will you lose anything by talking to
him at least he is back home?

2062
01:43:58,783 --> 01:44:02,575
Happiness from son is not born
for father when he is born

2063
01:44:03,158 --> 01:44:08,033
He feels the happiness when the public
identifies that son and praises him

2064
01:44:10,408 --> 01:44:16,450
Father will have the real happiness when all
praise him as an efficient and capable guy

2065
01:44:18,117 --> 01:44:23,742
Have you ever seen anybody praising him?

2066
01:44:24,242 --> 01:44:26,617
Where is he? Where? - Hubby

2067
01:44:26,825 --> 01:44:29,325
Get up idiot - Oh no, hand

2068
01:44:29,533 --> 01:44:33,825
Oh no - It’s always someone scolding him
but have you ever seen anyone praising him?

2069
01:44:34,450 --> 01:44:38,242
And now I haven’t come to the
hospital and not wished him it seems

2070
01:44:39,325 --> 01:44:41,033
Deviprasad is a great master.

2071
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:45,283
I’ve received best teacher
award for four times

2072
01:44:45,617 --> 01:44:47,200
I’m a poet and intellectual.

2073
01:44:47,450 --> 01:44:49,492
I’ve got my own image in the society

2074
01:44:49,783 --> 01:44:53,367
But because of him,
my prestige and status are at stake

2075
01:44:55,450 --> 01:45:00,075
I’m a teacher who teach all that a
human with no education is an animal

2076
01:45:00,408 --> 01:45:03,533
And when an animal is coming out
of my house means it’s so insulting for me

2077
01:45:03,992 --> 01:45:09,242
We shall talk later hubby, let him eat
Yes, let him eat

2078
01:45:09,450 --> 01:45:12,908
He is eating right? He is been eating
me up from 20 years and let him eat

2079
01:45:12,992 --> 01:45:18,950
Hubby - I’m saying you again. If he again
meets with accident I’ll not come or talk

2080
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:24,283
Seeing your face all these years though I
had no love on him, I pretended so for you

2081
01:45:24,825 --> 01:45:32,658
That day, though I know he failed in exams, I brought
cake and celebrated his birthday because of you

2082
01:45:33,158 --> 01:45:36,242
Hey, take him in and give him food
- Come brother

2083
01:45:36,325 --> 01:45:37,450
Go, go inside

2084
01:45:37,658 --> 01:45:40,533
Listen to me hubby - Nothing more
that you say and I listen now

2085
01:45:40,867 --> 01:45:44,283
Because my prestige and status
are more for me than him

2086
01:45:44,325 --> 01:45:48,450
my prestige and status
are more for me than him

2087
01:45:48,700 --> 01:45:50,617
Yes, my prestige is important for me

2088
01:46:56,075 --> 01:47:00,492
Your dad has more love on his
prestige and status than you

2089
01:47:02,867 --> 01:47:08,242
Your dad feels ashamed when he comes to know that
Son of Deviprasad is working in a textile shop

2090
01:47:08,867 --> 01:47:13,200
So, there’s just one way out and
that is you coming out from the house

2091
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:58,908
Brother... Stop, dad is coming

2092
01:50:11,908 --> 01:50:12,908
Take this

2093
01:50:13,617 --> 01:50:15,200
maybe you’ll come back as it is raining

2094
01:50:16,450 --> 01:50:19,700
Don’t return till you pass either
a cyclone comes or it thunders

2095
01:50:46,783 --> 01:50:52,158
That day you said to go somewhere and live
happily right? I’m ready now, come let’s go

2096
01:51:03,408 --> 01:51:07,117
We’ve been saying so many film
news but what about the tickets?

2097
01:51:07,158 --> 01:51:13,367
Yes, get your tickets on Pay TM guys, because not just getting
cinema tickets but shall enjoy so many cash back offers

2098
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:18,158
discounts, coupons with special seating...

2099
01:51:18,242 --> 01:51:21,658
Vehicle broke down and old man is in the
vehicle, should drop till Railway station

2100
01:51:21,867 --> 01:51:23,950
I’m late bro,
getting sleep and not possible

2101
01:51:23,992 --> 01:51:25,468
Poor old man, he’s getting late for train

2102
01:51:25,492 --> 01:51:26,825
He’ll pay as much required

2103
01:51:27,033 --> 01:51:30,158
Not money matter but... Ok, ask him to come
Thanks bro

2104
01:51:55,367 --> 01:51:56,575
Get in fast sir, we’ll go

2105
01:52:22,742 --> 01:52:24,283
Dad, stop please. Dad...

2106
01:52:29,533 --> 01:52:31,658
Dad, take at least this umbrella. Dad...

2107
01:52:32,575 --> 01:52:33,575
dad

2108
01:52:35,658 --> 01:52:37,818
Dad... Am I not fit to at
least hold umbrella for you?

2109
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:29,492
I don’t have enough brains to become a software
Engineer, Doctor or a Lecturer like you

2110
01:53:30,033 --> 01:53:32,992
My matter is just this much,
say what could I do dad?

2111
01:53:38,033 --> 01:53:41,117
If anybody asks you why
your son is driving a cab

2112
01:53:41,158 --> 01:53:44,783
say my son couldn’t study and
had to do something for living

2113
01:53:45,950 --> 01:53:49,117
I’m not into robberies or pick
pocketing for you to feel ashamed dad

2114
01:53:49,992 --> 01:53:51,408
I saw a news yesterday in the paper

2115
01:53:52,742 --> 01:53:55,742
When parents were asked a
question how do they wish their kids to be

2116
01:53:56,450 --> 01:53:57,992
78% in Canada

2117
01:53:58,992 --> 01:54:02,075
70% in UK said they
should be happy it seems

2118
01:54:02,533 --> 01:54:06,783
Parents from our country said they have
to settle in life and earn huge money

2119
01:54:08,950 --> 01:54:11,325
You are all seeing happiness in earning

2120
01:54:11,658 --> 01:54:14,200
but where is the link in between
earning and happiness dad?

2121
01:54:16,408 --> 01:54:19,200
Ok, if there is happiness in earning

2122
01:54:19,283 --> 01:54:24,700
why are Doctors and Engineers earning Lakhs
undergoing depression and committing suicide?

2123
01:54:25,867 --> 01:54:30,492
Happiness is not in earning money dad,
it’s in doing the work we like

2124
01:54:32,742 --> 01:54:33,742
Leave that,

2125
01:54:33,950 --> 01:54:36,075
I’m very happy driving this cab dad

2126
01:54:37,742 --> 01:54:45,742
Except a small pain that I’m away from
you, mom and sister

2127
01:54:51,075 --> 01:54:52,450
And about the settlement

2128
01:54:53,617 --> 01:54:55,992
none knows what and when
something happens in life, dad

2129
01:54:56,617 --> 01:54:59,177
There are people working in
Mechanic shed who turned Contractors

2130
01:54:59,867 --> 01:55:02,587
There are auto drivers who developed
to a stage giving work to a few

2131
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:05,617
Who knows,
I may become the owner of this Taxi

2132
01:55:05,992 --> 01:55:09,658
and grow to a stage giving work to a few
Who knows dad

2133
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:11,908
when would life change someone?

2134
01:55:16,033 --> 01:55:17,033
Come dad, let’s go home

2135
01:55:17,950 --> 01:55:18,950
Get into the car

2136
01:55:37,950 --> 01:55:38,950
Get in dad

2137
01:57:02,325 --> 01:57:10,325
I’ve never cut a tree in life or harmed any
living being. I’d just misunderstood you

2138
01:57:16,783 --> 01:57:22,950
I for the first time am feeling to write a
poetry about you, son. Language is not enough

2139
01:57:27,533 --> 01:57:35,200
How much was the heart in pain
to know the value of life?

2140
01:57:36,283 --> 01:57:44,283
How much was the heart drilled
to know the value of tears?

2141
01:57:45,158 --> 01:57:53,158
Will you bring the shed flowers
and stick them back to a branch?

2142
01:57:53,658 --> 01:57:59,700
Will you bring the shed flowers
and stick them back to a branch?

2143
01:57:59,783 --> 01:58:07,783
Value of his heart is known
after the person is gone far away

2144
01:58:10,992 --> 01:58:18,992
Ask the mouth how many are the
words you slipped and it’ll say

2145
01:58:19,533 --> 01:58:25,367
Ask the mouth how many are the
words you slipped and it’ll say

2146
01:58:25,658 --> 01:58:33,658
Value of a word is known
when it is followed

2147
01:58:34,242 --> 01:58:40,075
How much was the heart in pain
to know the value of life?

2148
01:58:40,242 --> 01:58:48,242
How much was the heart drilled
to know the value of tears?

2149
01:58:48,992 --> 01:58:56,992
Will the birds fly
following the conditions?

2150
01:58:57,575 --> 01:59:03,492
Will the birds fly
following the conditions?

2151
01:59:03,617 --> 01:59:11,617
Value of a wish is known
under the ban at every step

2152
01:59:12,283 --> 01:59:18,117
How much was the heart in pain
to know the value of life?

2153
01:59:18,242 --> 01:59:24,367
How much was the heart drilled
to know the value of tears?

2154
01:59:24,492 --> 01:59:32,117
Without the darkness where
is the value for the light?

2155
01:59:33,075 --> 01:59:39,283
Without the darkness where
is the value for the light?

2156
01:59:39,367 --> 01:59:47,367
Value of today is known
after yesterday has ended

2157
01:59:48,283 --> 01:59:54,283
How much was the heart in pain
to know the value of life?

2158
01:59:54,367 --> 02:00:02,242
How much was the heart drilled
to know the value of tears?

2159
02:00:03,158 --> 02:00:11,158
Every person has a wish and
every heart has a feeling

2160
02:00:12,033 --> 02:00:18,242
Every person has a wish and
every heart has a feeling

2161
02:00:18,367 --> 02:00:26,367
The value of affection
worshipped by the feel is known

2162
02:00:26,950 --> 02:00:32,825
How much was the heart in pain
to know the value of life?

2163
02:00:32,950 --> 02:00:40,950
How much was the heart drilled
to know the value of tears?

2164
02:00:41,783 --> 02:00:49,783
Life is the only boon
which never returns back

2165
02:00:50,450 --> 02:00:56,492
Life is the only boon
which never returns back

2166
02:00:56,575 --> 02:01:04,575
Value of dreams is known
in the breath of freedom
