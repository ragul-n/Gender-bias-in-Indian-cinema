Take oblation daughter-in-law,
and then distribute it to everyone.

25
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,750
Okay.

26
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,916
Grandpa, give us oblation.

27
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Here.

28
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,666
Take.

29
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:20,256
And for this hand?

30
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:23,375
[Laughing]

31
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,181
Grandpa is great!

32
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,916
Mother, take oblation.

33
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,103
Go, give oblation to
your junior uncle too.

34
00:05:33,487 --> 00:05:36,862
Uncle, take oblation.

35
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:40,060
Instead of studying early morning,
you are eating oblation...

36
00:05:40,147 --> 00:05:41,189
and creating a ruckus?

37
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,125
Uncle, if you eat oblation,
you don't need to study.

38
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,541
- Rubbish!
- You pass without studying.

39
00:05:46,598 --> 00:05:47,848
Take, eat.

40
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:53,306
Look Mr. Pappu, and Mr. Gappu,
keep the oblation here and leave.

41
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:58,603
- We did good, and he took offence.
- Indeed!

42
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:02,272
Where is everyone? Is
there anyone in this house?

43
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:08,791
Elder daughter-in-law!
Where are you?

44
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,041
I've been screaming all my life.

45
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,250
All the women here are useless,
no one has brains.

46
00:06:15,225 --> 00:06:18,333
Why are you screaming
early in the morning?

47
00:06:18,424 --> 00:06:21,008
You haven't even washed your face,
and you are already yelling.

48
00:06:21,077 --> 00:06:24,035
I washed my face long ago.
I cannot find a towel.

49
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,208
Nothing is in place in this house.

50
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,027
It's you who is not in place.
Here's the towel.

51
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,541
I know.

52
00:06:31,923 --> 00:06:35,548
I ate dinner at 10in the night.
I've been screaming for breakfast...

53
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,875
but no one listens.

54
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:40,635
Sit calmly, your
daughters-in-law will get it.

55
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,208
Mother...

56
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:46,306
Have you stuffed cotton in
your ears, or have you gone deaf?

57
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,125
You never come with one call.

58
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,217
Shall I bring the breakfast here,
or keep it in the kitchen?

59
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:52,241
Keep it on my head.

60
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,486
If she keeps it on your head,
how will you eat?

61
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,050
You keep quiet! You
interfere in everything.

62
00:06:57,894 --> 00:07:01,375
These old men take pension
and then keep nagging us women.

63
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,750
- I'm fed up of you.
- Whatever God wills.

64
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,695
God wills!

65
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,250
What are you waiting for?
Serve me breakfast.

66
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:13,458
Idiot! She killed my
son and survives herself.

67
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:18,500
- Younger daughter-in-law!
- Yes, mother?

68
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:22,125
Just because your husband
left for Bombay for four days...

69
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,780
you don't feel like
doing any chores?

70
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:28,000
I'd asked you
arrange dry fruit for me.

71
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,755
The doctor has asked me to eat them.

72
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,455
- Did you ask someone to get them?
- I'd asked Kamal to get them.

73
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,178
- I'll ask him.
- Why will you ask him? I'll ask him.

74
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,329
Kamal.

75
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:43,320
- Yes, sister-in-law?
- She didn't call you, I did.

76
00:07:43,391 --> 00:07:45,375
- What is it?
- Did you bring dry fruit for me?

77
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,638
- I bought it yesterday itself.
- Where is it?

78
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,836
The dry fruit was very good.

79
00:07:51,068 --> 00:07:53,818
We have that two legged cat
in the house, she ate them.

80
00:07:54,063 --> 00:07:56,376
Cat? Where is the cat?

81
00:07:56,736 --> 00:07:58,611
Don't you know the
cat in this house?

82
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:02,024
Here, mother.
She is still eating it.

83
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,291
Mother!

84
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:07,779
Mother! Look, brother
is calling me a cat.

85
00:08:07,873 --> 00:08:10,250
- I will!
- Yes, I'm a cat.

86
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:13,125
I claw everyone. The whole
family is jealous of me.

87
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,000
[Murmuring]

88
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:18,916
Sorry! From tomorrow,
drink my share of milk too.

89
00:08:19,043 --> 00:08:21,585
Look mother, he taunted me again.

90
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,676
I won't live here anymore,
I'll go to my husband's house.

91
00:08:25,184 --> 00:08:28,684
That's great! You have spoken
sensible for the first time in life.

92
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:29,833
[Chuckling]

93
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:33,051
Look, the moment you said it,
my brother-in-law is here.

94
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,853
Mother, I won't go.

95
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,349
Okay dear, don't go. Stay with me.

96
00:08:39,445 --> 00:08:42,403
A husband must stay with his wife.

97
00:08:42,687 --> 00:08:45,353
I mean, a wife must
stay with her husband.

98
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,125
- She will live with me.
- Bravo, Sarang! Spoken like a man!

99
00:08:49,301 --> 00:08:51,676
Don't you dare interfere. Get lost!

100
00:08:53,021 --> 00:08:55,601
- Now tell me, what were you saying?
- I didn't say anything, mother.

101
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,708
My father told me to bring Bhairavi.

102
00:08:57,814 --> 00:09:01,189
Tell that singer father of
yours my Bhairavi will not come.

103
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:08,583
My daughter went there only for
two days, and she got a ear ache.

104
00:09:08,766 --> 00:09:12,208
Forget humans, even animals
cannot live in that house.

105
00:09:12,415 --> 00:09:17,791
Mother, you are not insulting
my father, but a great artiste.

106
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:21,142
I won't leave without
taking Bhairavi!

107
00:09:21,235 --> 00:09:26,166
Okay, sit here and keep chanting...

108
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,663
'I'll take Bhairavi with me'

109
00:09:28,783 --> 00:09:30,117
Let's go, dear.

110
00:09:32,653 --> 00:09:35,153
No one can study in this house.

111
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:40,018
Kamal, where are you
going early morning?

112
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,893
I'm going some place
outside to study.

113
00:09:42,226 --> 00:09:44,476
- Can't you study at home?
- Is his home?

114
00:09:44,768 --> 00:09:48,976
It's a battlefield. On one hand,
mother spews bombs.

115
00:09:49,185 --> 00:09:51,351
And Bhairavi spews
bullets from her mouth.

116
00:09:51,907 --> 00:09:54,018
Only father can talk of peace here.

117
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:58,190
- You should not make fun of elders.
- Sorry sister-in-law.

118
00:09:58,601 --> 00:10:00,935
This is the advice you give
me everyday and I forget it.

119
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:05,851
But remember, no one can
live peacefully in this house.

120
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:15,268
Uncle, you are still sitting here?

121
00:10:15,351 --> 00:10:18,143
You are talking of sitting,
I'll put a mattress here.

122
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,697
Until your aunt, that is my wife,
will not come with me...

123
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:24,189
I will not move from here.

124
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:30,382
Uncle, eat oblation. Aunt
will come immediately with you.

125
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,018
- Is it?
- Yes.

126
00:10:32,106 --> 00:10:33,981
Then give it to me quickly!

127
00:10:34,643 --> 00:10:38,393
Uncle is waiting for aunty!
Uncle is waiting for aunty!

128
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:44,268
Wow! There's so much
glory in God's oblation.

129
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:46,435
Glory to you, God!

130
00:10:47,018 --> 00:10:51,143
Bhairavi, what do I call for you?

131
00:10:51,435 --> 00:10:55,018
Car, carriage, buggy, rickshaw?

132
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:57,268
I think, a cycle will be fine.

133
00:10:57,351 --> 00:10:59,101
I'll sit in the front,
and you sit behind.

134
00:10:59,185 --> 00:11:00,726
Where will you take me?
To the movies?

135
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:04,310
- Movies?
- Yes. Take me to the movies.

136
00:11:04,393 --> 00:11:07,935
Movies early in the morning?
And it's not even Sunday today.

137
00:11:08,006 --> 00:11:10,214
- I've come to take you home.
- Move!

138
00:11:10,851 --> 00:11:14,976
I will go to the bazaar,
to the jungle with you...

139
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:16,491
but I won't come to your house.

140
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:19,410
Listen Bhairavi, are you
coming home with me or not?

141
00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:20,739
No!

142
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:24,143
Look, I'll ask you three
times to come home with me.

143
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,435
- One...
- Mother.

144
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:28,226
- Two...
- Mother.

145
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,685
- Three...
- Mother!!

146
00:11:33,255 --> 00:11:35,838
[Muttering]

147
00:11:36,143 --> 00:11:40,226
Even God's oblation has no power.
Now I'll sit here and fast!

148
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:46,685
Gappu, does a man's
fasting matter in this house?

149
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:52,226
- Only women's fasting matters.
- Then what will become of men?

150
00:11:52,387 --> 00:11:54,512
Whatever God wills.

151
00:11:59,268 --> 00:12:02,518
[All Laughing]

152
00:12:10,213 --> 00:12:13,296
Enough. We cannot run anymore.
Even our legs are aching.

153
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,458
- Let's go home.
- You all go,

154
00:12:15,565 --> 00:12:17,398
- I'll stay here for some time.
- Alone?

155
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:21,614
Who knows, as soon as we leave,
from alone, she becomes twosome.

156
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,940
- Naughty!
- Don't worry, we won't butt in.

157
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:54,247
When a young girl looks desperately
at her watch, what does it mean?

158
00:12:55,201 --> 00:12:58,826
It's obvious. She's
waiting for her boyfriend.

159
00:13:00,189 --> 00:13:03,939
I'll leave, why
should I disturb anyone?

160
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,580
But how does the boyfriend
of such a beautiful girl look?

161
00:13:10,627 --> 00:13:12,044
Let me also see.

162
00:13:21,756 --> 00:13:26,048
[Baby Crying]

163
00:13:30,507 --> 00:13:35,007
So this lady is not someone's
girlfriend, she is a mother.

164
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,291
This is strange, mister.

165
00:13:55,374 --> 00:13:57,833
The child is crying and
you are busy studying?

166
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,466
Why do you tell me?
Tell the child's mother.

167
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,634
Lady, close your book
and take care of the child.

168
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,868
Why are you telling me?

00:26:48,738 --> 00:26:53,113
- Excuse me. Can I smoke?
- Go ahead.

338
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:55,488
- Thank you.
- It's all right.

339
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:08,726
- You didn't recognise me?
- Sorry?

340
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,530
- You have a friend, Madan.
- Yes.

341
00:27:11,613 --> 00:27:12,946
I'm his sister.

342
00:27:14,696 --> 00:27:15,780
Ragini.

343
00:27:15,863 --> 00:27:17,071
Yes.

344
00:27:17,785 --> 00:27:19,035
[Train Horn]

345
00:27:22,352 --> 00:27:27,988
I was sorry to know that the
pilot who you were going to marry...

346
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:33,280
was killed in a plane crash
just a day before your marriage.

347
00:27:33,988 --> 00:27:39,571
- That's an old story.
- It seems very recent to me.

348
00:27:42,488 --> 00:27:44,280
Shall I tell you something funny?

349
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:50,289
Before your brother fixed your
marriage with that pilot officer...

350
00:27:50,405 --> 00:27:52,821
- he had sent me your proposal.
- Is it?

351
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,407
But father had fixed my
alliance with someone else.

352
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,188
[Laughing]

353
00:28:00,821 --> 00:28:03,655
- Shall I tell you something funny?
- Yes.

354
00:28:03,863 --> 00:28:08,988
My brother had shown me the pictures
of both, that pilot, and you.

355
00:28:09,196 --> 00:28:11,071
And I had chosen you.

356
00:28:11,155 --> 00:28:12,780
[Laughing]

357
00:28:13,113 --> 00:28:20,113
- Ragini, are you married?
- No. I don't intend to marry now.

358
00:28:20,321 --> 00:28:21,446
Why?

359
00:28:22,714 --> 00:28:25,589
Actually, my brother got me
and my younger sister trained...

360
00:28:25,696 --> 00:28:29,488
- in dance and music since childhood.
- Okay.

361
00:28:29,655 --> 00:28:34,363
We are more interested in that. We
have even started a dancing school.

362
00:28:35,238 --> 00:28:39,113
Our days are going
well doing social service.

363
00:28:39,276 --> 00:28:42,401
Oh, so that is why you
are carrying this sitar.

364
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,613
Yes.

365
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,030
Uncle is back.

366
00:28:54,113 --> 00:28:56,405
- Do you still do sharp shooting?
- Yes.

367
00:28:56,488 --> 00:29:00,155
Then here's your prize,
a gun for both of you.

368
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,488
Scram!

369
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,196
- You are back, brother?
- Kamal! how are you?

370
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,113
- I'm fine.
- How are you studies going?

371
00:29:12,196 --> 00:29:13,363
Going great.

372
00:29:13,446 --> 00:29:17,363
- Even I have come. Hello, Kailash.
- How are you, Sarang?

373
00:29:17,863 --> 00:29:21,821
- Sarang has become dull.
- Don't worry, you'll get color soon.

374
00:29:21,905 --> 00:29:25,280
- You have come at the right time.
- Has something come for me...

375
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,655
- A small job for you.
- What job?

376
00:29:27,738 --> 00:29:31,280
- Get brother's luggage from the car.
- I should get it?

377
00:29:31,363 --> 00:29:33,238
Yes. You are the
son-in-law of this family...

378
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,589
and a son-in-law
has to do everything.

379
00:29:34,613 --> 00:29:37,405
I forgot I'm the
son-in-law of this family.

380
00:29:37,488 --> 00:29:40,071
- He has to do everything.
- Run!

381
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:44,363
Father.

382
00:29:44,946 --> 00:29:47,321
What happened to you? Why
are you walking with a stick?

383
00:29:47,405 --> 00:29:50,082
It's not for me, it's for you.

384
00:29:50,238 --> 00:29:51,238
[Laughing]

385
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:55,488
But father, don't keep it in
one corner. Make use of it.

386
00:29:56,488 --> 00:29:57,780
Come on.

387
00:29:58,405 --> 00:29:59,155
Son.

388
00:29:59,238 --> 00:30:01,946
Mother! how are you?

389
00:30:02,131 --> 00:30:03,381
- My son.
- Mother!

390
00:30:03,488 --> 00:30:07,363
I've bought a tonic for you.
It's very good for your health.

391
00:30:07,446 --> 00:30:10,155
Brother, you did good in
bringing tonic for mother.

392
00:30:10,363 --> 00:30:13,030
Mother weight has reduced
by two pounds last month.

393
00:30:13,116 --> 00:30:15,821
- Not two, three pounds.
- Three?

394
00:30:15,905 --> 00:30:17,155
Naughty!

395
00:30:17,363 --> 00:30:21,363
Son, you care so much for me.
But he doesn't care for me at all.

396
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:23,238
Mother, he's your younger son.

397
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,196
The elder son takes
care of his mother.

398
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,280
My son!

399
00:30:26,331 --> 00:30:29,460
Kailash, I've kept
your suitcase upstairs.

400
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:32,321
For which I'll gift you a camera.

401
00:30:32,405 --> 00:30:34,817
- Camera?
- Camera! For me.

402
00:30:35,071 --> 00:30:36,780
What a lovely camera!

403
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,988
A pose! A pose!
Pose!

404
00:30:40,113 --> 00:30:42,071
Ready! One, two...

405
00:30:42,613 --> 00:30:47,780
- Sarang, there is no film in it.
- What? No film?

406
00:30:47,863 --> 00:30:51,821
- You gave me the camera, but no film.
- I've bought the film too. Take.

407
00:30:51,905 --> 00:30:55,238
Very good! This will be fun.

408
00:30:55,696 --> 00:30:57,655
[Laughing]
He will only click snaps now!

409
00:30:59,238 --> 00:31:03,613
- Brother...
- What? Why don't you speak?

410
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:08,405
I know. He'll ask for money.
You are always asking for money.

411
00:31:08,613 --> 00:31:10,196
You spend so much money everyday.

412
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,113
- Kamal, why do you need money?
- I don't want money.

413
00:31:14,234 --> 00:31:19,068
My college is very far.
Buy me a cycle.

414
00:31:19,405 --> 00:31:22,905
- You will travel on a cycle?
- Pull his ear!

415
00:31:23,018 --> 00:31:25,196
Wants a cycle indeed.
Can't you walk?

416
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:28,571
You won't go to college
on a cycle, but a bike.

417
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:32,545
- Take Rs.2000.
- Rs.2000! Give it to me.

418
00:31:33,613 --> 00:31:37,363
- See! Both are similar.
- Whatever God wills.

419
00:31:37,446 --> 00:31:41,905
Brother gave me Rs.2000.
I'll buy a bike. And then...

420
00:31:42,757 --> 00:31:46,215
Enough. Look, I've even
bought a watch for you.

421
00:31:47,863 --> 00:31:50,030
- Brother, this is lovely.
- Isn't it?

422
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,863
Sister-in-law, hold this.

423
00:31:54,738 --> 00:31:56,030
Tie it on my hand.

424
00:31:59,113 --> 00:32:02,030
Thank you. Shake hand.

425
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,464
Come on! Come on! Shake hands!

426
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:04,547
Sister-in-law, shake hands.

427
00:32:04,571 --> 00:32:08,321
Why are you teaching fashion
to old fashioned people like us?

428
00:32:08,405 --> 00:32:10,214
Sister-in-law, this
fellow has become very brazen.

429
00:32:10,238 --> 00:32:14,905
- When your wife comes, teach her.
- You must be joking.

430
00:32:16,821 --> 00:32:18,196
Oh God!

431
00:32:18,655 --> 00:32:21,488
Sister-in-law, I've
bought a saree for you...

432
00:32:21,571 --> 00:32:23,571
and toys and clothes
for the children.

433
00:32:23,738 --> 00:32:25,047
They are with Sita.
Take them from her.

434
00:32:25,071 --> 00:32:26,113
Okay.

435
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,155
You've bought something
or the other for everyone.

436
00:32:30,306 --> 00:32:33,363
Bhairavi, I thought you have
left for your in-laws home.

437
00:32:33,461 --> 00:32:39,253
Anyway... take these glasses.
They look good on you.

438
00:32:41,178 --> 00:32:45,446
You need glasses. I can
see everything without them.

439
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,506
- Bhairavi, wear that.
- Why?

440
00:32:48,613 --> 00:32:49,738
You look good.

441
00:32:49,821 --> 00:32:52,571
You don't come home, so
I'll take your photo home.

442
00:32:52,655 --> 00:32:56,655
Ready? 1, 2, 3!

443
00:32:57,215 --> 00:32:59,780
She's gone. What a bother!

444
00:33:01,405 --> 00:33:03,905
Children, wait.
Shall I take your photo?

445
00:33:03,988 --> 00:33:05,569
Yes.
Very good.

446
00:33:05,821 --> 00:33:06,988
Smile.

447
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:10,696
One.. two..

448
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:14,030
Three..

449
00:33:14,488 --> 00:33:15,738
Where did they go?

450
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:19,238
Is this a camera or a gun?
No one stands before it.

451
00:33:19,321 --> 00:33:22,752
[Laughing]
Sita!

452
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:57,499
May this moon continue
to smile in my life.

453
00:33:58,613 --> 00:34:02,821
May I always smile and
laugh in its shadow.

454
00:34:04,655 --> 00:34:09,530
When you laugh, my
whole life rejoices.

455
00:34:10,571 --> 00:34:14,711
In the beautiful depths of
your eyes, I find every joy of life.

456
00:34:15,946 --> 00:34:20,613
I go out to work, but
my heart stays with you.

457
00:34:22,034 --> 00:34:25,909
And my heart and body,
everything goes with you.

458
00:34:27,196 --> 00:34:30,696
I only know how I spend my days.

459
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:36,654
- How lucky I am.
- I am more lucky than you are.

460
00:34:37,987 --> 00:34:41,153
Okay, now take a
wash and eat something. Sita?

461
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,862
You didn't ask me what
I have bought for you.

462
00:34:44,237 --> 00:34:47,945
When you arrive, I get everything.

463
00:34:48,474 --> 00:34:50,738
That is why,
I have bought the best...

464
00:34:50,821 --> 00:34:52,530
and the most beautiful
thing for you.

465
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,032
Yes. Look.

466
00:34:56,914 --> 00:34:58,248
Like it?

467
00:34:59,113 --> 00:35:00,488
It's beautiful.

468
00:35:01,696 --> 00:35:02,780
Yes.

469
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,297
You bought expensive gifts
for everyone in the house.

470
00:35:05,321 --> 00:35:08,405
- What wrong did I do?
- Don't be angry, Bhairavi.

471
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:10,363
Take, you wear this necklace.

472
00:35:10,446 --> 00:35:11,488
Take.

473
00:35:11,571 --> 00:35:14,488
Bhairavi, this necklace
is for your sister-in-law.

474
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:17,655
- I'll get another for you.
- I don't want anything!

475
00:35:17,738 --> 00:35:18,863
Bhairavi.

476
00:35:18,988 --> 00:35:22,571
You are my only sister.
You are always fighting.

477
00:35:22,655 --> 00:35:24,535
This necklace is
worthless when compared to you.

478
00:35:24,613 --> 00:35:27,405
And then, your brother can do
anything for your happiness.

479
00:35:28,321 --> 00:35:31,405
But Bhairavi, you are the
daughter of a good family.

480
00:35:31,821 --> 00:35:33,988
You should go and live
in your husband's home...

481
00:35:34,078 --> 00:35:37,849
- and make his life happy.
- Enough! I don't want a lecture.

482
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:39,573
Bhairavi.

483
00:35:41,655 --> 00:35:43,071
Sita, wear it.

484
00:35:44,988 --> 00:35:46,821
You don't bother about her. Wear it.

485
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:49,446
I'll wear it for you.

486
00:35:52,196 --> 00:35:57,696
May your arms always be around me.

487
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:03,030
- Younger daughter-in-law!
- Mother is calling me.

488
00:36:03,738 --> 00:36:05,946
Younger daughter-in-law!

489
00:36:06,988 --> 00:36:08,071
You work shirker!

490
00:36:08,155 --> 00:36:11,405
You are sitting like a queen
while I work like a servant.

491
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,071
You are sitting with
him since morning.

492
00:36:13,155 --> 00:36:15,905
He has returned only
from Bombay, not exile.

493
00:36:15,988 --> 00:36:19,571
Forget that act, come down
and do the house chores.

494
00:36:25,511 --> 00:36:27,428
It is better to stay
in exile than live here.

495
00:36:28,027 --> 00:36:31,152
I am fed up of this house. We
will separate from the family, Sita.

496
00:36:31,405 --> 00:36:34,780
Don't say that. We must all
live together in this house.

497
00:36:35,488 --> 00:36:38,405
You are the oldest.
If you separate...

498
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,196
the family will break up.

499
00:36:41,035 --> 00:36:42,993
You should not mind mother's words.

500
00:36:43,847 --> 00:36:47,014
Take a wash,
I'll bring your clothes.

501
00:37:00,396 --> 00:37:01,979
[Laughing]

502
00:37:02,532 --> 00:37:03,949
Why are you laughing?

503
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,238
If you laugh so much, pearls
will fall from your mouth.

504
00:37:11,446 --> 00:37:13,030
Tell me, why are you laughing?

505
00:37:13,321 --> 00:37:16,113
Do men wear women's
clothes in Bombay?

506
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:21,280
My bag got exchanged with Ragini.

507
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,571
You give me some
other set of clothes.

508
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:36,030
Sita, you didn't
ask me who Ragini is.

509
00:37:36,584 --> 00:37:39,667
If there was a need to tell,
you would tell me yourself.

510
00:37:40,238 --> 00:37:41,780
You are an angel, Sita.

511
00:37:45,686 --> 00:37:49,477
- Mr. Kailash.
- Ragini? How come you're here?

512
00:37:49,762 --> 00:37:50,542
Yes.

513
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:54,013
- I've come to return your suitcase.
- Why did you bother?

514
00:37:54,217 --> 00:37:56,842
- It's okay.
- I would come myself.

515
00:37:57,038 --> 00:37:59,871
Sita, she is Ragini
who I told you about.

516
00:38:00,008 --> 00:38:01,467
- Hello.
- Hello.

517
00:38:01,561 --> 00:38:03,269
It's only me who is
hassled in this house.

518
00:38:03,379 --> 00:38:05,419
The older daughter-in-law
is busy with her children.

519
00:38:05,446 --> 00:38:07,101
And the younger one is
busy with her husband.

520
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:08,917
She has been talking
to him since morning.

521
00:38:10,342 --> 00:38:13,592
Mother is calling me. You
talk to him, I'll be back.

522
00:38:13,738 --> 00:38:14,780
Okay.

523
00:38:15,238 --> 00:38:17,405
You must not have come
across such a family anywhere.

524
00:38:18,405 --> 00:38:20,321
There is a commotion in
the house all the time.

525
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,946
They don't even care if
we have guests at home.

526
00:38:23,196 --> 00:38:25,238
Every family has the
same problem, Mr. Kailash.

527
00:38:25,655 --> 00:38:28,488
Somewhere, brothers are fighting
somewhere, the father and son fight...

528
00:38:28,655 --> 00:38:30,415
and somewhere, there's
trouble from the wife.

529
00:38:30,488 --> 00:38:32,571
My wife is an angel.

530
00:38:33,155 --> 00:38:35,821
It is her love that draws me to her.

531
00:38:36,155 --> 00:38:37,988
Or there is nothing here for me.

532
00:38:39,631 --> 00:38:41,547
Ragini, you have been
standing since so long. Sit down.

533
00:38:41,571 --> 00:38:44,738
It's okay. I'm getting late.
Some other time.

534
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,405
I'll bring your suitcase.

535
00:38:49,124 --> 00:38:51,268
- Give it to me.
- I'll take it to your car.

536
00:38:51,321 --> 00:38:52,613
Thank you.

537
00:39:12,085 --> 00:39:13,376
[Scooter Horn]

538
00:39:53,315 --> 00:39:54,815
- Listen.
- Yes?

539
00:39:54,972 --> 00:39:56,972
How did you know my address?

540
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,738
I come to know everything
with the magic of this wand.

541
00:40:01,238 --> 00:40:04,446
Your father's name is Mr.
S.L.Gupta, advocate.

542
00:40:04,821 --> 00:40:06,613
Your height is 5ft 2"

543
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,863
Your weight, 115 pounds.

544
00:40:09,071 --> 00:40:11,738
Your telephone number is 3501.

545
00:40:11,905 --> 00:40:13,339
I even called you
day before yesterday.

546
00:40:13,363 --> 00:40:14,696
- You did?
- Yes.

547
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,863
- But your mother came on the line.
- What have you done!

548
00:40:17,946 --> 00:40:21,030
Don't worry, I said I
got the wrong number.

549
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,405
Listen.

550
00:40:22,613 --> 00:40:25,988
But who gave you my address,
my telephone number?

551
00:40:26,696 --> 00:40:28,905
- You did.
- When did I?

552
00:40:28,988 --> 00:40:32,571
You wrote it and told me. Look,
everything is written in this.

553
00:40:33,321 --> 00:40:36,196
- My diary, with you?
- And I'm with you.

554
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,863
I thought I'd lost my diary.

555
00:40:38,946 --> 00:40:41,655
You found your diary, but I am lost.

556
00:40:42,363 --> 00:40:45,780
Remain lost, there is no one
here who will try to find you.

557
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:47,655
- Give my diary.
- No...

558
00:40:47,738 --> 00:40:49,363
- You won't give?
- No.

559
00:40:49,446 --> 00:40:51,030
- Look mister.
- Yes, madam?

560
00:40:51,238 --> 00:40:53,405
It's not right to
steal a girl's diary.

561
00:40:53,488 --> 00:40:56,363
And it's not right to
steal a boy's heart.

562
00:40:56,655 --> 00:41:00,155
- You are very cunning.
- I wasn't, I have become one.

563
00:41:00,488 --> 00:41:03,113
- Since when?
- Since I have seen you.

564
00:41:12,988 --> 00:41:17,571
- Listen, write a letter to my parents.
- You write to them.

565
00:41:19,363 --> 00:41:22,780
- You'll have to write it.
- I will, but what do I write?

566
00:41:23,696 --> 00:41:27,740
That I have given p all my
work and am sitting with my wife?

567
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:29,071
[Laughing]

568
00:41:33,196 --> 00:41:36,155
Mother look what older
sister-in-law is hiding and taking.

569
00:41:36,613 --> 00:41:39,030
Older daughter-in-law!

570
00:41:40,696 --> 00:41:42,905
- Yes, mother?
- What are you hiding and taking?

571
00:41:43,821 --> 00:41:45,655
Tamarind chutney for Sita.

572
00:41:45,738 --> 00:41:51,196
Can't she eat food without chutney?
Keep the chutney back.

573
00:41:51,488 --> 00:41:53,905
She feels like eating
something tangy.

574
00:41:54,821 --> 00:41:57,780
Tangy indeed. Like
as if she's pregnant.

575
00:41:58,196 --> 00:42:00,446
Yes mother, she's pregnant.

576
00:42:01,905 --> 00:42:05,030
What! She's expecting?

577
00:42:08,196 --> 00:42:13,405
Listen! Read the newspaper later.
First hear this news.

578
00:42:13,488 --> 00:42:18,696
- So much love in your words today?
- Why not? I have good news.

579
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,571
- Sita is pregnant.
- Oh! Whatever God wills.

580
00:42:22,655 --> 00:42:23,905
Yes!

581
00:42:24,259 --> 00:42:27,280
- Take.
- Why did you bring it?

582
00:42:27,363 --> 00:42:30,655
- I'd get it myself.
- I won't reduce if I work.

583
00:42:31,488 --> 00:42:35,571
And listen, you must not
use the stairs often now.

584
00:42:35,988 --> 00:42:38,868
Oh, that's the case?

585
00:42:40,555 --> 00:42:42,155
Coming, mother!

586
00:42:45,108 --> 00:42:48,358
[Laughing]

587
00:42:49,405 --> 00:42:54,264
- Sita, will you get a boy or a girl?
- How do I know?

588
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:59,363
You don't know? Then who knows?
Okay, I'll tell you. Choose a finger.

589
00:42:59,571 --> 00:43:01,446
Why are you feeling shy? Choose one.

590
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:05,988
You'll get a boy!

591
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:09,863
If it's a girl, I'll
offer Satyanarayan prayers.

592
00:43:09,946 --> 00:43:12,155
I'll worship Lord Shanker.

593
00:43:13,321 --> 00:43:17,321
You pray for them, and they
don't care at all for you.

594
00:43:17,405 --> 00:43:19,325
Younger sister-in-law
told elder sister-in-law...

595
00:43:19,425 --> 00:43:20,967
but she didn't tell you.

596
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,571
That means, you are inconsequential,
she's more important.

597
00:43:25,363 --> 00:43:30,571
You are right. Let's take
a decision on this first.

598
00:43:30,964 --> 00:43:35,756
- Sita, why didn't you tell me?
- How would I tell you?

599
00:43:35,886 --> 00:43:38,844
- Younger daughter-in-law!
- Mother is calling.

600
00:43:39,571 --> 00:43:41,071
Daughter-in-law!

601
00:43:42,071 --> 00:43:46,030
How dare you treat
me as inconsequential?

602
00:43:46,113 --> 00:43:49,571
- What is the matter, mother?
- You keep quietly. Sita, come down.

603
00:43:50,696 --> 00:43:53,321
Is Gauri elder to me in this house?

604
00:43:53,405 --> 00:43:55,325
- But mother...
- I told you to stay out of this.

605
00:43:55,405 --> 00:43:59,571
Don't defend her. Go upstairs.
You come down!

606
00:44:01,946 --> 00:44:04,488
Daughter-in-law, if you had
given me this good news...

607
00:44:04,571 --> 00:44:07,780
I'd order the finest things for you.

608
00:44:07,888 --> 00:44:11,030
- Kamal! What is it?
- Get a ton of sugar from the bazaar.

609
00:44:11,071 --> 00:44:14,488
- What for, mother?
- Your sister-in-law is pregnant.

610
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:17,321
Congratulations!

611
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,780
Shake hands,
why are you feeling shy?

612
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,232
[Laughing]

613
00:44:22,363 --> 00:44:28,280
- May you get a doll like daughter.
- May you beget a son.

614
00:44:28,738 --> 00:44:31,030
Let him ask for a son,
you will get a daughter.

615
00:44:31,113 --> 00:44:33,821
- What if she gets a son?
- Not possible.

616
00:44:33,946 --> 00:44:35,905
When I say it will be a girl,
it will be a girl.

617
00:44:35,988 --> 00:44:39,942
Mother, stop fighting. She'll
get twins, a boy, and a girl.

618
00:44:40,055 --> 00:44:41,555
[Laughing]

619
00:44:51,854 --> 00:44:55,271
[Humming]

620
00:45:35,707 --> 00:45:43,249
"O beauty, you're incomparable"

621
00:45:43,863 --> 00:45:50,571
"O beauty, you're incomparable"

622
00:45:51,196 --> 00:45:58,030
"There's none like you in thousands"

623
00:45:58,582 --> 00:46:05,582
"O beauty, you're incomparable"

624
00:46:20,613 --> 00:46:28,613
"You are a bud that has
brought along spring in the garden"

625
00:46:35,321 --> 00:46:43,321
"You are a ray bathed in moonlight"

626
00:46:49,905 --> 00:46:56,821
"Your beauty, your looks"

627
00:46:57,321 --> 00:47:04,280
"Is like the moon among stars"

628
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:11,488
"O beauty, you're incomparable"

629
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:30,863
"There's such charm in your eyes"

630
00:47:31,446 --> 00:47:38,030
"Like overflowing goblets"

631
00:47:38,821 --> 00:47:46,821
"There's such silence on your lips,
like a thousand stories spread"

632
00:47:53,280 --> 00:48:01,280
"Your hair have such color,
like dark clouds in spring"

633
00:48:07,988 --> 00:48:14,738
"O beauty, you're incomparable"

634
00:48:32,238 --> 00:48:39,030
"If a poet sees your face"

635
00:48:39,571 --> 00:48:46,030
"He'll fill his
poetry with freshness"

636
00:48:46,863 --> 00:48:53,571
"If a man gets you"

637
00:48:54,071 --> 00:49:01,113
"It'll be like his
dreams have come alive"

638
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:08,280
"If a song finds you"

639
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:16,196
"He can fill pain in
his heart strings"

00:49:23,738 --> 00:49:30,530
"There's none like you in thousands"

642
00:49:30,905 --> 00:49:37,488
"O beauty, you're incomparable"

643
00:49:53,655 --> 00:49:57,197
You look very happy today.
What has happened to you?

644
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:02,189
Who is he?

645
00:50:04,058 --> 00:50:07,100
I understand.
So he is your boyfriend.

646
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,963
He's your wrong number.
I'll deal with him.

647
00:50:11,026 --> 00:50:12,234
Mother!

648
00:50:12,303 --> 00:50:16,756
You keep him in your heart while I
get you thrown out of the house.

649
00:50:18,863 --> 00:50:20,655
I'll tell your father today itself.

650
00:50:21,613 --> 00:50:24,071
That is why you deck up these days.

651
00:50:24,234 --> 00:50:26,318
That is why you come
home late everyday now.

652
00:50:26,405 --> 00:50:32,264
Late? But I am back early today.
Why are you angry?

653
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:35,508
I am getting angry, and
your daughter is very happy...

654
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:37,073
bringing you disgrace.

655
00:50:37,405 --> 00:50:40,030
I did not paint your
picture even after marriage...

656
00:50:40,238 --> 00:50:43,571
and your daughter is
painting some goon's picture.

657
00:50:43,738 --> 00:50:47,738
Is that so? I really
am fed up of this girl.

658
00:50:48,956 --> 00:50:51,539
Usha! Usha!

659
00:50:55,863 --> 00:50:58,738
Child, what rubbish is
your mother talking?

660
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,821
Whose picture are you painting?

661
00:51:02,196 --> 00:51:06,030
It's not wrong to paint a picture,
it's wrong to be fooled.

662
00:51:06,946 --> 00:51:11,946
The way I don't misunderstand you,
you also don't misunderstand me.

663
00:51:12,821 --> 00:51:16,196
More than my happiness, I
care for your happiness.

664
00:51:16,613 --> 00:51:21,155
Show me the picture.
Show me... show it to me.

665
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:31,530
Kamal? Ramdas' son?

666
00:51:32,696 --> 00:51:34,155
God bless you!

667
00:51:34,888 --> 00:51:39,138
If my daughter marries into this
family, I'll be the luckiest man.

668
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:42,290
Leela!

669
00:51:42,321 --> 00:51:47,280
- Come.. I was waiting for you.
- How come you thought of me today?

670
00:51:47,446 --> 00:51:50,280
- What work do you have with me?
- Sit down, I'll tell you.

671
00:51:51,571 --> 00:51:56,113
Aunt, find me a proposal for Usha.
I'm fed up of this girl.

672
00:51:56,446 --> 00:52:01,321
She is roaming free. I
want to get her married soon.

673
00:52:02,071 --> 00:52:04,613
I have a boy in mind.
The family is rich.

674
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:07,655
- You must have heard of Ramdas.
- Yes.

675
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:09,821
He lost his oldest
son in an accident.

676
00:52:10,196 --> 00:52:12,113
The other manages business.

677
00:52:12,488 --> 00:52:15,155
And the third is
doing his graduation.

678
00:52:15,348 --> 00:52:18,113
But the boy's mother,
she's a terror.

679
00:52:18,223 --> 00:52:23,030
Her name is Shanta, but she's always
so rude to her daughters-in-law.

680
00:52:23,102 --> 00:52:25,561
Yes, aunt! that's the kind of
mother-in-law I want for Usha...

681
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:31,283
- who keeps thrashing her.
- She'll do even worse.

682
00:52:31,863 --> 00:52:33,905
Your husband has come. I'm leaving.

683
00:52:36,363 --> 00:52:40,780
Saw what your daughter is up to?
Get her married now at least.

684
00:52:40,863 --> 00:52:44,405
- What's the hurry?
- You may not be in a hurry, I am.

685
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:47,030
Or people will say the step
mother is not getting her married.

686
00:52:47,162 --> 00:52:51,388
- Okay, but we must find a boy first.
- I'll suggest a boy.

687
00:52:52,186 --> 00:52:55,977
- Fix the alliance with Ramdas' son.
- Ramdas' son?

688
00:52:57,352 --> 00:53:00,686
Are you crazy? We are
no comparison to them.

689
00:53:00,821 --> 00:53:04,238
- They are such a renowned family.
- Are we any less?

690
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:07,571
You don't understand. They
will demand a huge dowry.

691
00:53:07,655 --> 00:53:10,238
So what? We have only one daughter.

692
00:53:11,155 --> 00:53:14,071
What do I say? I'll
do whatever you say.

693
00:53:14,446 --> 00:53:17,488
I'll meet Ramdas
today itself. Happy?

694
00:53:21,284 --> 00:53:27,350
Come in. Welcome.
What can we do for you?

695
00:53:27,453 --> 00:53:32,163
Don't feel shy, feel at home.

696
00:53:32,238 --> 00:53:34,571
Keep this here.

697
00:53:34,738 --> 00:53:37,488
Sit down. Sit comfortably.

698
00:53:38,238 --> 00:53:40,946
- What will you have? Tea, or coffee?
- Nothing, thank you.

699
00:53:41,019 --> 00:53:42,644
- Cold drink?
- No.

700
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,469
- Atleast have water.
- No.

701
00:53:46,196 --> 00:53:51,363
- Are there no elders in the house?
- Even we'll grow up in a few years.

702
00:53:52,113 --> 00:53:54,821
Uncle has come!

703
00:53:55,988 --> 00:54:00,363
- Have you come to meet father?
- Yes. Don't you know me?

704
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:02,030
- No.
- Doesn't matter.

705
00:54:02,196 --> 00:54:04,155
You will get to know me.

706
00:54:04,696 --> 00:54:08,905
- I've come to see you.
- Me? Why?

707
00:54:09,405 --> 00:54:11,196
I'll tell that to your elders.

708
00:54:16,321 --> 00:54:19,863
Children, why are you
sitting among elders? Go from here.

709
00:54:19,946 --> 00:54:22,571
- They are cute children.
- They are very naughty.

710
00:54:27,738 --> 00:54:30,530
- Thank you, I don't smoke.
- But I smoke.

711
00:54:30,613 --> 00:54:33,030
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

712
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:48,412
If you don't mind,
shall I give you an advice?

713
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:56,155
If you have come to this
house with a proposal, forget it.

714
00:54:56,318 --> 00:54:57,321
Why?

715
00:54:57,365 --> 00:55:00,573
Our financial state is very bad.
We are going to go bankrupt.

716
00:55:00,696 --> 00:55:03,071
And where I'm concerned,
I'm a useless guy.

717
00:55:03,201 --> 00:55:04,534
I don't make any money.

718
00:55:04,633 --> 00:55:09,633
But I heard, last year, you
paid Rs.200000 as income tax.

719
00:55:09,821 --> 00:55:12,488
You are talking of last year,
I'm talking of this year.

720
00:55:12,571 --> 00:55:18,238
Income tax, sales tax, advance tax,
we are only paying taxes.

721
00:55:18,321 --> 00:55:22,363
That's okay. There are
ups and downs in business.

722
00:55:22,446 --> 00:55:24,571
- That's no cause of worry.
- No?

723
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:25,863
Yes.

724
00:55:26,196 --> 00:55:31,613
- Please call your father.
- He's praying. He'll take 3-4 hours.

725
00:55:31,696 --> 00:55:34,030
- No problem, I'll wait.
- What?!

726
00:55:35,155 --> 00:55:37,946
You are a busy man.
Talk to him on the phone.

727
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:41,238
The work I have come for,
cannot be discussed over the phone.

728
00:55:41,321 --> 00:55:44,488
- Not at all?
- Mr. Shyamlal.

729
00:55:44,571 --> 00:55:48,155
- Damn! Father has come.
- What brings you here?

730
00:55:48,238 --> 00:55:49,655
I...

731
00:55:50,428 --> 00:55:51,261
[Chuckling]

732
00:55:51,446 --> 00:55:53,488
Father, you finished
your prayers very soon.

733
00:55:53,571 --> 00:55:56,405
What rubbish are you talking? I
finished prayers in the morning.

734
00:55:56,530 --> 00:56:01,321
Oh. Maybe I got up late.
I often get up late.

735
00:56:01,405 --> 00:56:06,613
You talk to him. I'm leaving.
Good bye.

736
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:12,172
Please sit down.
What brings you here?

737
00:56:12,405 --> 00:56:15,655
Actually, my only daughter...

738
00:56:15,738 --> 00:56:17,113
It's okay.

739
00:56:18,905 --> 00:56:22,446
My only daughter, Usha
is of marriageable age.

740
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,071
I have come with her proposal
for your younger son, Kamal.

741
00:56:27,155 --> 00:56:30,030
Is that so? Whatever God wills.

742
00:56:34,405 --> 00:56:37,821
What is the matter?
Why are you buttering me?

743
00:56:38,405 --> 00:56:42,280
- Mother, shall I ask you something?
- Yes.

744
00:56:43,243 --> 00:56:46,077
How much dowry did you
take in brother's marriage?

745
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:52,053
- You don't know? Rs.20000.
- How much dowry will you take for me?

746
00:56:52,363 --> 00:56:56,571
If I can get Rs.100000,
I'll take Rs.100000.

747
00:56:57,238 --> 00:56:59,738
- Shall I give you good news?
- Yes.

748
00:56:59,821 --> 00:57:02,988
There is a man outside who's
come with a proposal for me.

749
00:57:03,092 --> 00:57:04,717
- Really?
- Yes.

750
00:57:04,809 --> 00:57:06,655
But I won't marry his daughter.

751
00:57:06,821 --> 00:57:09,905
Why are you stopping
money that I can get?

752
00:57:09,988 --> 00:57:12,238
Mother, there's a huge
difference in what he's offering.

753
00:57:13,405 --> 00:57:14,946
- How much will he give?
- Give?

754
00:57:15,044 --> 00:57:17,738
He says he's poor, he'll
only give his daughter.

755
00:57:18,655 --> 00:57:20,738
- Then why is he sitting in my house?
- Go ask him.

756
00:57:20,821 --> 00:57:24,155
Move aside! I'll throw him out.

757
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,655
Our mother is so nice.

758
00:57:29,615 --> 00:57:30,615
Excuse me.

759
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,738
Who is he? Has he
brought a proposal for our son?

760
00:57:34,988 --> 00:57:37,905
- Yes. Greetings.
- Greetings.

761
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:42,238
Sit down, Mr. Shyamlal.
You don't know him.

762
00:57:42,328 --> 00:57:45,037
He's a very rich man of our city.

763
00:57:46,405 --> 00:57:47,446
Is it?

764
00:57:47,561 --> 00:57:51,186
- He has a house in every colony.
- That's great.

765
00:57:51,488 --> 00:57:55,030
- I'll take a house in dowry.
- Everything is yours.

766
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,030
Bhairavi! get tea and biscuits.

767
00:57:59,238 --> 00:58:02,321
My daughter is fortunate to
get a mother-in-law like you.

768
00:58:02,428 --> 00:58:06,053
I love my daughters-in-law a lot.
I don't let them do any work.

769
00:58:07,446 --> 00:58:09,405
What are you doing, Sita!

770
00:58:09,488 --> 00:58:12,071
How much I tell them not to work,
but they don't listen.

771
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,696
We have servants in
the house, I'm there.

772
00:58:14,863 --> 00:58:17,988
She doesn't need to work.

773
00:58:18,863 --> 00:58:21,196
- Gappu, Pappu, come here.
- What is it, uncle?

774
00:58:22,196 --> 00:58:26,030
I have already said,
I'll do whatever you say.

775
00:58:27,613 --> 00:58:30,696
Then fix a date
and get them married.

776
00:58:31,432 --> 00:58:32,640
[Sneezing]

777
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:40,238
- Two sneezes!
- Whatever God wills!

778
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:43,966
The marriage is fixed!
When we started business...

779
00:58:44,031 --> 00:58:46,906
someone had sneezed twice.
And our business flourished.

780
00:58:46,971 --> 00:58:49,096
You messed up the whole thing.

781
00:58:49,716 --> 00:58:51,280
- You are back, son?
- Yes, mother.

782
00:58:51,571 --> 00:58:54,988
He is my older son,
Kailash. He's Mr. Shyamlal.

783
00:58:55,092 --> 00:58:56,300
- Hello.
- Hello.

784
00:58:56,655 --> 00:58:58,655
Kamal's marriage has been
fixed with his daughter.

785
00:58:58,722 --> 00:59:00,597
That's great.

786
00:59:01,696 --> 00:59:05,571
- One more thing. The marriage will take place in our house.
- Okay.

787
00:59:05,738 --> 00:59:07,696
But you will have to
bear all the expenses.

788
00:59:07,821 --> 00:59:11,988
I accept. I'll take your leave now.

789
00:59:12,084 --> 00:59:16,982
I'll finalize a date and
get back to you. Good bye.

790
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:22,946
Sister-in-law, do you
see what's happening?

791
00:59:23,405 --> 00:59:27,280
Before matters go beyond this,
you'll have to do something.

792
00:59:27,946 --> 00:59:30,030
- But how, Kamal?
- I don't know that.

793
00:59:30,655 --> 00:59:33,571
I only know I cannot
marry anyone except Usha.

794
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:38,321
- Then go and tell mother.
- Even you are my mother.

795
00:59:39,238 --> 00:59:41,363
No one knows me in this
house better than you.

796
00:59:43,738 --> 00:59:47,696
Sister-in-law, you
will have to help me.

797
00:59:53,405 --> 00:59:58,071
Hey! Where are you going
all decked up? Go inside!

798
00:59:58,696 --> 01:00:00,655
Enough of your love affair.

799
01:00:00,946 --> 01:00:03,571
Your father has gone
to fix your alliance.

800
01:00:03,821 --> 01:00:05,821
- My marriage?
- Then mine?

801
01:00:06,113 --> 01:00:08,655
Wait for some time,
he'll come and tell you...

802
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:10,655
who you'll sing love duets with.

803
01:00:11,363 --> 01:00:15,968
- Did you fix the alliance?
- Can I deny you anything?

804
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:18,738
You ordered me, I did the job.

805
01:00:18,905 --> 01:00:22,738
- The marriage will take place this month.
- Father! What are you saying?

806
01:00:22,863 --> 01:00:25,488
- You didn't even ask me.
- Did you hear that?

807
01:00:25,905 --> 01:00:30,905
Child, do you think you
are wiser than your mother?

808
01:00:31,191 --> 01:00:37,858
You don't know how hard she has
tried to give you a good life.

809
01:00:38,405 --> 01:00:42,030
- I won't marry!
- Look at her daring.

810
01:00:42,321 --> 01:00:47,238
I will see only your daring today.
You prepare breakfast...

811
01:00:47,321 --> 01:00:49,738
let me see how she doesn't obey you.

812
01:00:50,488 --> 01:00:52,780
Make something nice.

813
01:00:56,571 --> 01:01:01,738
Mother! tell me,
what should I do now?

814
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,738
Usha, dear.

815
01:01:06,563 --> 01:01:12,647
What is this? Girls cry while
leaving home after marriage.

816
01:01:13,363 --> 01:01:15,238
You are crying before marriage?

817
01:01:15,511 --> 01:01:19,465
Father, if my mother as alive...

818
01:01:20,446 --> 01:01:23,280
I wouldn't be married off
like that against my wish.

819
01:01:24,405 --> 01:01:29,446
Child, your mother
is dead, tat is true.

820
01:01:30,946 --> 01:01:35,405
But your father is still alive.
Don't you trust your father?

821
01:01:35,946 --> 01:01:37,196
Father.

822
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:38,857
[Sobbing]

823
01:01:40,821 --> 01:01:45,363
- I have given my word to Kamal.
- Can't you change your decision?

824
01:01:46,321 --> 01:01:47,780
- No.
- No?

825
01:01:47,914 --> 01:01:52,202
- Never.
- Then you'll marry Kamal.

826
01:01:53,048 --> 01:01:55,548
- Father?
- It's the truth.

827
01:01:55,655 --> 01:01:59,488
- I've fixed your marriage with him.
- Really, father?

828
01:01:59,571 --> 01:02:01,655
I'm speaking the truth.

829
01:02:02,113 --> 01:02:06,488
- Mother, I won't marry this girl.
- Why?

830
01:02:06,571 --> 01:02:07,613
It's my wish.

831
01:02:07,696 --> 01:02:10,488
Not your wish, my wish will
be followed in this house.

832
01:02:10,571 --> 01:02:12,655
- What I want will be done.
- No!

833
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:14,982
I'm getting married.
What I want will happen.

834
01:02:15,655 --> 01:02:18,321
Are you listening?
Even you say something.

835
01:02:18,946 --> 01:02:21,266
But what will you say? You'll
only say 'whatever God wills'

836

You are such a sissy. You
don't have any manliness in you.

838

839

You don't interfere.
It's a question of my life.

840
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:35,071
She's not getting me married,
she's ruining me.

841
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:37,738
Kamal, what rubbish are you talking?

842
01:02:38,113 --> 01:02:40,071
A mother can never do
anything bad for her child.

843
01:02:40,488 --> 01:02:42,946
Whatever she does is for their good.

844
01:02:43,238 --> 01:02:46,738
- Apologise to mother.
- I apologise.

845
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:48,530
But I won't marry.

846
01:02:50,113 --> 01:02:54,196
I should not say anything,
but I must say...

847
01:02:54,405 --> 01:02:57,655
if Kamal does not want to get
married, we must not force him.

848
01:02:58,321 --> 01:03:01,082
It is very necessary to take the boy
and girl's consent in a marriage.

849
01:03:01,446 --> 01:03:04,530
It means even you don't want
brother to get married.

850
01:03:04,696 --> 01:03:08,488
Yes, even I don't want him
to marry against his wish.

father wants it, brother wants it...

You look very sad today.

You are happy.
Did you like that girl?

With whom your
marriage has been fixed.

887
01:06:38,321 --> 01:06:45,530
- Oh, so the news has reached.
- One must never trust men.

888
01:06:45,821 --> 01:06:49,030
They love someone,
and marry someone else.

889
01:06:49,405 --> 01:06:51,738
When parents compel you,
what can be done?

890
01:06:52,613 --> 01:06:55,030
A true lover must
confront his parents.

891
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:58,136
Confront? It's easy to say.

892
01:06:58,321 --> 01:07:00,655
Parents are two, and
the lover only one.

893
01:07:00,821 --> 01:07:02,571
How can one man stand against two?

894
01:07:02,696 --> 01:07:06,652
Nice calculation. Coward!

I'll please mine.

- I'll marry that goon.

Goon? Which goon?

900
01:07:22,696 --> 01:07:28,363
My father has chosen a boy
for me. But he's a goon.

901
01:07:28,988 --> 01:07:33,738
When my father went to see him,
he blew smoke into his face.

What?

903
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:37,816

they have gone bankrupt.

904
01:07:38,136 --> 01:07:38,863
Then?

905
01:07:38,946 --> 01:07:42,030
He also said his
father won't meet him.

01:07:42,446 --> 01:07:45,196
He's sitting for prayers and
will take four hours to finish.

- Usha, is your's name Shyamlal?
- Like your father's name is Ramdas.

- Oh damn!
- My father told me everything.

- See you later.
- Where are you going?

910
01:07:58,238 --> 01:08:01,394

Or we'll have a problem.

What is the matter?

915
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:17,717
Children must not go
against their parents.

916
01:08:18,029 --> 01:08:20,091
They must obey them.

917
01:08:20,446 --> 01:08:23,488
If they ask you to jump in a well,
you must do so immediately.

get me married to her.

See how wise my son is.

01:08:50,363 --> 01:08:52,738
He will marry the girl
we have chosen for him.

928

I'll call up Shyamlal right away.

929
01:08:55,196 --> 01:08:56,513
I'll ask him to fix
a date today itself.

wise in such a short time.

01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:52,008
"Get lost! You cannot suppress me"

1007
01:15:52,113 --> 01:15:56,030
"Get lost! You cannot suppress me"

1008
01:15:56,113 --> 01:15:59,863
"Who will argue with you,
you are shameless"

1009
01:15:59,946 --> 01:16:04,113
"Who will argue with you,
you are shameless"

1010
01:16:06,613 --> 01:16:13,738
"My brother's
mother-in-law is useless"

1011
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:17,155
"And his father-in-law is a cheat"

1012
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:22,866
"And his father-in-law is a cheat"

1013
01:16:25,488 --> 01:16:30,542
"My daughter's
sister-in-law is an idiot"

1014
01:16:30,607 --> 01:16:36,027
"My daughter's
sister-in-law is an idiot"

1015
01:16:36,113 --> 01:16:38,738
"The entire family is strange"

1016
01:16:38,821 --> 01:16:41,405
"The bride's family is a nuisance"

1017
01:16:41,488 --> 01:16:44,030
"The entire family is strange"

1018
01:16:44,155 --> 01:16:46,655
"The bride's family is a nuisance"

1019
01:16:46,748 --> 01:16:51,789
"Don't ask about my brother,
my brother's is great!"

1020
01:16:51,988 --> 01:16:57,365
"My daughter is beautiful"

1021
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:07,655
"Don't ask about my brother,
my brother's is great!"

1022
01:17:12,946 --> 01:17:18,071
"My daughter is beautiful"

1023
01:17:23,196 --> 01:17:28,196
"Don't ask about my brother,
my brother's is great!"

1024
01:17:28,405 --> 01:17:33,238
"My daughter is beautiful"

1025
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:38,645
"Don't ask about my brother,
my brother's is great!"

1026
01:17:38,738 --> 01:17:40,858
You are sitting here, and I
was looking for you there.

1027
01:17:41,113 --> 01:17:44,613
I'm not in a mood,
Kamal. I'm very tired.

1028
01:17:44,863 --> 01:17:48,030
Okay, if you won't come,
even I'll sit here.

1029
01:17:48,266 --> 01:17:51,683
- Come on, Kamal!
- Please come, sister-in-law.

1030
01:17:52,071 --> 01:17:54,238
There's such revelry
going on downstairs...

1031
01:17:54,321 --> 01:17:56,238
all your tiredness will disappear.

1032
01:17:56,863 --> 01:18:01,405
- You go, I'm not feeling well.
- Sister-in-law, please come.

1033
01:18:02,196 --> 01:18:04,622
- Wear your sandals.
- What are you doing!

1034
01:18:04,905 --> 01:18:07,571
You are sitting here? There's
such revelry on downstairs...

1035
01:18:07,655 --> 01:18:09,575
- and the groom is sitting here.
- We are coming.

1036
01:18:09,613 --> 01:18:10,738
Come soon.

1037
01:18:10,821 --> 01:18:14,738
Hey! this pose is good.
I'll take a picture.

1038
01:18:14,821 --> 01:18:16,446
Sure.

1039
01:18:18,363 --> 01:18:20,817
The camera is not working again.
This camera is useless.

1040
01:18:20,906 --> 01:18:23,156
- I'll repair it.
- It's just like you.

1041
01:18:24,196 --> 01:18:26,280
Sister-in-law, where is
your diamond necklace?

1042
01:18:26,655 --> 01:18:28,030
Wait, I'll get it.

1043
01:18:33,530 --> 01:18:35,613
I'll deck you up so much today,
that seeing you...

1044
01:18:35,696 --> 01:18:37,113
even the bride will be embarrassed.

1045
01:18:37,905 --> 01:18:40,405
- You are very naughty.
- Me, and naughty?

1046
01:18:40,571 --> 01:18:42,971
The one who is going to arrive
is going to be double naughty.

1047
01:18:43,050 --> 01:18:44,467
- Who?
- Your baby.

1048
01:19:29,089 --> 01:19:32,381
Enough of your talk
of love. Now leave.

1049
01:19:32,873 --> 01:19:35,042
Sister-in-law, if I don't
tell you my heart's feelings...

1050
01:19:35,066 --> 01:19:37,226
- who do I tell it to?
- I don't want to hear anything.

1051
01:19:37,363 --> 01:19:40,488
Since brother has come,
you have no time for me.

1052
01:19:40,571 --> 01:19:41,863
I'm going.

1053
01:19:45,639 --> 01:19:49,222
I'm the only one who's evil in this
house. All the other are angels.

1054
01:19:49,305 --> 01:19:52,180
In a few days, you'll know
it yourself who is evil.

1055
01:20:01,071 --> 01:20:03,696
- You are very naughty.
- Me, and naughty?

1056
01:20:03,797 --> 01:20:06,190
The one who is going to arrive
is going to be double naughty.

1057
01:20:06,214 --> 01:20:07,631
- Who?
- Your baby.

1058
01:20:17,105 --> 01:20:19,522
Stop!!

1059
01:20:21,433 --> 01:20:25,891
Mr. Kailash, you?
What madness is this?

1060
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:27,957
What did you intend to do?

1061
01:20:29,155 --> 01:20:33,113
I was driving here, and
didn't know the road ahead is bad.

1062
01:20:33,483 --> 01:20:37,373
But were you going at such
great speed to commit suicide? Yes Ragini.

1063
01:20:37,821 --> 01:20:41,709
- But why did save me?
- What is the matter?

1064
01:20:42,957 --> 01:20:47,932
- Anyway, come home.
- What home? In that sin hole?

1065
01:20:48,311 --> 01:20:50,769
I will never step
into that house again.

1066
01:20:51,113 --> 01:20:55,571
Okay, if you don't want to go
to that house, come to my house.

1067
01:20:59,613 --> 01:21:01,196
- Beena!
- Yes madam?

1068
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:02,905
- Get coffee.
- Yes madam.

1069
01:21:11,623 --> 01:21:14,082
Brother said so many
things about you...

1070
01:21:14,294 --> 01:21:18,439
that gave me the impression you
are such a sensible and brave man.

1071
01:21:18,907 --> 01:21:22,449
Being so mature, what is
this you were going to do?

1072
01:21:22,759 --> 01:21:25,963
If I had not been there,
wonder what would have happened.

1073
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:29,999
Defeated by troubled,
you think of suicide...

1074
01:21:30,175 --> 01:21:31,633
what kind of bravery is that?

1075
01:21:31,714 --> 01:21:34,505
Wish you had not saved me, Ragini.

1076
01:21:37,342 --> 01:21:40,758
You are perhaps not aware that
there are certain situations...

1077
01:21:40,857 --> 01:21:44,398
seeing which, man
finds it difficult to live.

1078
01:21:44,842 --> 01:21:47,258
Only death can bring him peace then.

1079
01:21:47,849 --> 01:21:49,474
You care for your peace...

1080
01:21:49,573 --> 01:21:55,073
but didn't care what your
step would do to others.

1081
01:21:55,164 --> 01:21:59,373
But a man who no one needs,
who does he live for?

1082
01:21:59,625 --> 01:22:03,834
Ragini, I trusted everyone in life.

1083
01:22:03,971 --> 01:22:07,721
And in return, I only got cheated.

1084
01:22:08,077 --> 01:22:12,827
Those who I thought were good,
turned out to be poison for me.

1085
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:16,050
I don't feel like living
any more in this world.

1086
01:22:16,793 --> 01:22:21,918
No one needs me here. No
one will cry over my death.

1087
01:22:22,016 --> 01:22:26,475
How can you say that? I will.

1088
01:22:26,842 --> 01:22:29,175
What is the use of
these talks, Ragini?

1089
01:22:29,566 --> 01:22:32,691
They cannot bring
back peace in my life.

1090
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:33,925
Why not.

1091
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:37,450
I promise you, I will
eliminate all darkness...

1092
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:40,078
and bring light
into your life again.

1093
01:22:40,683 --> 01:22:44,058
If man is alive, he
can get back everything.

1094
01:22:44,337 --> 01:22:47,795
Have faith in me, I will
bring back your happiness.

1095
01:22:48,078 --> 01:22:50,869
Yes. But you will
have to promise me...

1096
01:22:51,042 --> 01:22:53,875
you won't try to run
away from life again.

1097
01:22:53,992 --> 01:22:56,159
Tell me, do you promise me?

1098
01:22:57,225 --> 01:22:59,975
Tell me.. come on!

1099
01:23:03,232 --> 01:23:05,482
The coffee has arrived.

1100
01:23:10,133 --> 01:23:15,175
- Beena, you know him?
- Of course, he's Mr. Kailash.

1101
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,819
So you know him.
Kailash, have coffee.

1102
01:23:19,597 --> 01:23:24,056
Next week, I and Beena
are doing a stage show.

1103
01:23:24,326 --> 01:23:29,826
You will have to come... don't
stare at me, you'll have to.

1104
01:23:31,633 --> 01:23:35,008
I will call up your home and
tell them you are in town.

1105
01:23:35,241 --> 01:23:38,241
No Ragini, I don't want
to see any of their faces.

1106
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:42,472
If they think I have gone somewhere,
let them think so.

1107
01:23:50,659 --> 01:23:52,159
[Bell Jingle]

1108
01:24:00,787 --> 01:24:03,703
Sister, you should
not do any work now.

1109
01:24:04,411 --> 01:24:09,911
Climbing stairs, going to the
garden to pluck flowers, nothing!

1110
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:12,763
Give, I'll make the garland for you.

1111
01:24:13,077 --> 01:24:17,035
But I only should make
the garland for God.

1112
01:24:20,832 --> 01:24:22,124
Sister.

1113
01:24:22,222 --> 01:24:28,097
Since I have come here, you have
never told me who you worship.

1114
01:24:28,856 --> 01:24:31,106
Can I see your idol?

1115
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:46,922
Hey! what are you doing?

1116
01:24:48,998 --> 01:24:50,998
Sister, I had never dreamed...

1117
01:24:51,222 --> 01:24:54,055
that you worship your husband.

1118
01:24:54,768 --> 01:24:59,143
We women are more
fortunate than men.

1119
01:24:59,874 --> 01:25:05,249
Men see God in the image
of Ram, Krishna, Shanker.

1120
01:25:05,764 --> 01:25:11,681
But a woman sees God in living
form in her husband's image.

1121
01:25:12,036 --> 01:25:14,744
Left-Right. Left-Right.

1122
01:25:14,865 --> 01:25:18,531
Aunt! Uncle is calling!

1123
01:25:18,982 --> 01:25:21,523
Go Usha, he must be waiting.

1124
01:25:24,198 --> 01:25:26,782
Jack and Jill went up the hill!

1125
01:25:26,932 --> 01:25:30,099
Jack and Jill went up the hill!

1126
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:32,530
Gappu, where is your uncle?

1127
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:35,295
First a kiss, then I'll tell you.

1128
01:25:35,414 --> 01:25:37,789
- Okay.
- And me?

1129
01:25:40,204 --> 01:25:43,037
- And me?
- Don't you feel ashamed!

1130
01:25:43,262 --> 01:25:45,422
How can you talk like that
in the presence of children.

1131
01:25:45,446 --> 01:25:48,738
Don't be angry, we are leaving.
Let's go, Pappu.

1132
01:25:48,776 --> 01:25:50,610
Bye Gappu.

1133
01:25:51,484 --> 01:25:52,817
I am naughty?

1134
01:25:53,951 --> 01:25:57,534
We don't get such opportunities
in this house again and again.

1135
01:25:57,905 --> 01:26:01,280
Don't you see? I don't
even get two minutes with you.

1136
01:26:01,481 --> 01:26:03,398
She comes screaming any time.

1137
01:26:03,562 --> 01:26:06,146
You should not make
fun of elders like that.

1138
01:26:07,796 --> 01:26:09,756
Even you have started
speaking like sister-in-law.

1139
01:26:09,970 --> 01:26:16,304
But everyone is equal in this home,
then what's the problem?

1140
01:26:16,738 --> 01:26:18,030
Take Bhairavi for example.

1141
01:26:18,071 --> 01:26:20,071
If she goes to her
home with her husband...

1142
01:26:20,139 --> 01:26:21,472
half our problems will be solved.

1143
01:26:21,539 --> 01:26:22,581
- Listen.
- Yes.

1144
01:26:22,649 --> 01:26:25,024
I have thought of a
magical way to send her home.

1145
01:26:25,096 --> 01:26:26,679
Tell me.

1146
01:26:26,826 --> 01:26:28,715
- I won't.
- You won't?

1147
01:26:28,831 --> 01:26:33,248
- Why?
- Because if I reveal it, the magic won't work.

1148
01:26:34,007 --> 01:26:38,048
Look madam, there should be no
secrets between husband and wife.

1149
01:26:38,405 --> 01:26:40,613
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1150
01:26:45,909 --> 01:26:47,909
Look, this is my magic.

1151
01:26:48,084 --> 01:26:51,959
- This is Sarang's picture.
- Yes. - Meaning?

1152
01:26:52,285 --> 01:26:56,243
Bhairavi will come here,
see this picture.

1153
01:26:56,382 --> 01:26:59,548
Then watch how my magic works.

1154
01:26:59,629 --> 01:27:02,254
The way my magic works on you.

1155
01:27:02,451 --> 01:27:04,576
There she comes!
Cast your spell on her.

1156
01:27:08,638 --> 01:27:09,846
What are you hiding?

1157
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:17,718
How could you dare to
make my husband's picture?

1158
01:27:19,135 --> 01:27:20,927
Isn't he handsome?

1159
01:27:21,243 --> 01:27:23,243
Whether he is or not,
why should you care?

1160
01:27:23,371 --> 01:27:24,579
Give me the snap!

1161
01:27:30,985 --> 01:27:35,776
- She's gone.
- See how the magic works?

1162
01:27:36,541 --> 01:27:40,957
No woman can bear another girl
making her husband's picture.

1163
01:28:01,356 --> 01:28:09,356
"Don't stare at me, O Charmer"

1164
01:28:11,196 --> 01:28:15,220
"My heart get charmed by your look"

1165
01:28:15,287 --> 01:28:19,790
"Don't stare at me, O Charmer"

1166
01:28:19,850 --> 01:28:24,683
"Don't stare at me, O Charmer"

1167
01:28:25,013 --> 01:28:28,998
"Cast the shadow of
your tresses on me"

1168
01:28:29,071 --> 01:28:37,071

- Home? - Yes. You sing so well.

Now tell me. What
happened to your magic?

Madam, I know my

However hard you try,
she won't budge.

Damn!

1200
01:32:23,068 --> 01:32:28,651
- Hello sir.
- Come Munimji. When is Kailash returning from Bombay?

1201
01:32:28,746 --> 01:32:30,579
Even I have come to ask that.

1202
01:32:30,731 --> 01:32:32,981
Many important jobs are
pending for his absence.

1203
01:32:33,331 --> 01:32:38,081
Strange man he is. He didn't
inform anyone before leaving.

1204
01:32:38,645 --> 01:32:39,978
Shanta!

1205
01:32:40,670 --> 01:32:43,378
Mom father is calling you.

1206
01:32:46,748 --> 01:32:51,706
- What is it?
- Do you have any news on Kailash?

1207
01:32:51,805 --> 01:32:55,764
I didn't even know he had left.
Who cares for me in this home?

1208

Everyone is doing as he pleases.

1209
01:32:58,232 --> 01:33:01,648
Sita was saying he may have gone
to Bombay for some urgent work.

1210
01:33:01,966 --> 01:33:03,924
What else would he do if not leave?

1211
01:33:04,059 --> 01:33:07,755
What peace does he have here?
Sita is enjoying life...

1212
01:33:07,838 --> 01:33:09,629
and she banished the poor fellow.

1213
01:33:09,713 --> 01:33:11,088
Bhairavi.

1214
01:33:11,204 --> 01:33:15,514
Why do you talk such nonsense?
Why accuse Sita?

1215
01:33:15,592 --> 01:33:19,622
And you are defending her.
Don't back answer me!

1216
01:33:19,699 --> 01:33:23,616
- Don't you dare pull my hair.
- I'll even pull them out.

I am your sister-in-law.

Even I am your sister-in-law,
not some servant.

Just try touching me again!

1220

Mom! this girl is being rude to me.

1221
01:33:33,639 --> 01:33:38,347
- She's bullying me.
- Is it? I'm coming.

1222
01:33:38,914 --> 01:33:41,081
You'll know now!

1223
01:33:42,043 --> 01:33:43,252
Where is she?

1224
01:33:45,382 --> 01:33:48,257
Why lady, even you
have developed wings?

1225
01:33:48,488 --> 01:33:51,446
When your father-in-law
could not boss in this house...

1226
01:33:51,518 --> 01:33:55,434
how can you? Lower
your head... come on!

1227
01:33:55,988 --> 01:33:59,446
- What did she say?
- I didn't say anything.

1228
01:33:59,748 --> 01:34:02,707
I only stopped her from
talking ill about Sita.

1229
01:34:02,977 --> 01:34:07,061
How dare you advise my daughter!
I will teach you lesson.

1230
01:34:07,130 --> 01:34:09,213
Mom! Stop it!

1231
01:34:11,219 --> 01:34:13,719
You are ordering me? Shameless man!

1232
01:34:13,971 --> 01:34:15,909
You are supporting your
wife in your mother's presence

1233
01:34:15,933 --> 01:34:18,641
Go away! And take her along too.

1234
01:34:22,737 --> 01:34:25,862
Hear this, mother! I will
stay here, and so will Usha.

1235
01:34:26,404 --> 01:34:28,612
If you have to throw out,
throw out this problem.

1236
01:34:29,508 --> 01:34:31,550
Look mother, my brothers
may have made their wives...

1237
01:34:31,574 --> 01:34:32,740
sacrificial goats before you.

1238
01:34:32,905 --> 01:34:35,952
- I won't do that.
- You call me a devil?

1239
01:34:36,068 --> 01:34:38,943
Yes, I am a devil! I demand
my daughters-in-law sacrifice.

1240
01:34:39,030 --> 01:34:41,394
Get out of here!

01:34:43,490 --> 01:34:47,240
- Why are you screaming?
- Ask your son, he's screaming.

1243
01:34:47,412 --> 01:34:52,079
Yes, I am screaming, because
father is quiet, helpless, weak.

1244
01:34:52,171 --> 01:34:55,838
But I am not weak. I
will fight this injustice.

1245
01:34:56,047 --> 01:34:57,424
This will not be
allowed in this house now!

1246
01:34:57,448 --> 01:35:00,406
Kamal, who are you talking against?

1247
01:35:00,724 --> 01:35:03,724
Don't you feel ashamed to talk
like that with your parents?

1248
01:35:04,348 --> 01:35:05,973
Why feel ashamed to talk the truth?

1249
01:35:06,679 --> 01:35:09,265
I cannot tolerate the way mother is
behaving with her daughters-in-law

1250
01:35:09,289 --> 01:35:11,164
Whatever she may do,
whatever she may say...

1251
01:35:11,284 --> 01:35:14,409
she is our mother. Both of
you apologise to mother.

1252
01:35:15,062 --> 01:35:18,937
- Sister-in-law!
- I said apologise. Usha, you too.

1253
01:35:20,026 --> 01:35:23,901
- Sorry mother.
- Get lost!

1254
01:35:25,964 --> 01:35:27,422
Whatever God wills!

1255
01:35:27,496 --> 01:35:32,121
Father, instead of bowing your
head and accepting everything...

1256
01:35:32,457 --> 01:35:34,957
if you raise your head
and do what you will...

1257
01:35:35,309 --> 01:35:37,184
this would not be the state today.

1258
01:35:40,965 --> 01:35:46,215
Sita, only you can save
this home from breaking up.

1259
01:35:46,649 --> 01:35:49,025
Only you can
convince these crazy heads.

1260
01:35:49,446 --> 01:35:54,196
Or it won't take time
for this home to crumble.

1261
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:01,752
Since so many years, my
only attempt has been...

1262
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:03,974
to keep this family together.

1263
01:36:04,526 --> 01:36:06,693
That no misunderstanding
are created.

1264
01:36:07,681 --> 01:36:12,097
Why are you being the cause
of breaking up that unity?

1265
01:36:12,291 --> 01:36:17,041
Why don't you understand? If we
keep quiet at your insistence...

1266
01:36:17,376 --> 01:36:18,876
nothing will improve in this family.

1267
01:36:20,051 --> 01:36:20,762
Please

1268
01:36:20,865 --> 01:36:22,990
Don't force me from
keeping quiet anymore.

1269
01:36:23,873 --> 01:36:28,248
So even that day has arrived now
when even you don't listen to me.

1270
01:36:28,310 --> 01:36:33,185
No sister-in-law,
don't say that again.

1271
01:36:33,764 --> 01:36:36,139
That day will never come.

1272
01:36:40,057 --> 01:36:42,849
You should not hurt Sita like that.

1273
01:36:43,183 --> 01:36:45,641
I am not hurting her.

1274
01:36:47,021 --> 01:36:49,355

unity she desires...

1275
01:36:50,089 --> 01:36:51,714

01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:06,667
"Like tales scattered"

1337
01:45:07,901 --> 01:45:14,984
"There is such charm
in your tresses"

1338
01:45:15,363 --> 01:45:22,696
"Like dark clouds in spring"

1339
01:45:23,032 --> 01:45:30,157
"O beauty, you are great!"

1340
01:45:49,459 --> 01:45:52,625
- What happened, sister?
- Nothing. I just tripped.

1341
01:45:52,732 --> 01:45:55,815
How many times have I told you
not to come down these days.

1342
01:45:56,032 --> 01:45:57,782
But you don't listen to anybody.

1343
01:45:58,164 --> 01:46:00,123
It's okay, I'm fine.

1344
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:10,073
- What is this?
- This gift is for that angel...

1345
01:46:10,768 --> 01:46:15,435
Ragini, who showered her love on a
dead man and brought it back to life.

1346
01:46:15,941 --> 01:46:19,316
Kailash, you
embarrass me with your talks.

1347
01:46:19,708 --> 01:46:21,958
Why do you bring such
expensive gifts for me?

1348
01:46:24,277 --> 01:46:25,198
Ragini.

1349
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:29,155
If I could, I would surrender
the world's wealth at your feet.

1350
01:46:29,726 --> 01:46:33,559
And then Ragini, I am only
living on your support today.

1351
01:46:34,414 --> 01:46:37,734
Since I have found you,
I have found the world.

1352
01:46:37,823 --> 01:46:42,365
- What else can I ask for?
- You have found me?

1353
01:46:42,659 --> 01:46:46,201
Great! I gave you a finger,
you caught my hand?

1354
01:46:46,331 --> 01:46:49,613
You had said, why I saved you,
now you say you won't leave me.

1355
01:46:49,692 --> 01:46:51,692
Ragini, don't laugh it off.

1356
01:46:51,768 --> 01:46:56,851
I am speaking the truth. And
I also know that you like me.

1357
01:46:58,082 --> 01:47:01,165
I was blind until today. I did
not know what was good or bad.

1358
01:47:01,834 --> 01:47:03,417
- Is it?
- Of course.

1359
01:47:03,883 --> 01:47:08,175
Or why would I shun a gem like
you & embrace that piece of glass?

1360
01:47:09,008 --> 01:47:12,300
But the other day you said
that your wife is an angel.

1361
01:47:12,440 --> 01:47:15,565
Ragini! the one who I
am trying to forget...

1362
01:47:15,802 --> 01:47:17,635
wonder why are you
reminding me of her.

1363
01:47:18,050 --> 01:47:20,467
In fact, you should
help me forget her.

1364
01:47:23,915 --> 01:47:27,790
You told me that day that
you will brighten my world.

1365
01:47:27,932 --> 01:47:33,474
Keep your promise.
Ragini, I want to marry you.

1366
01:47:33,893 --> 01:47:38,435
- Marry?
- Yes. I cannot live without you now.

1367
01:47:38,834 --> 01:47:43,202
- Tell me, do you accept?
- Give me time to think.

1368
01:47:43,317 --> 01:47:47,942
Take as long as you like.
Just tell me what you desire.

1369
01:47:48,042 --> 01:47:49,084
What?

1370
01:47:49,206 --> 01:47:52,685
Only your happiness. You know that.

1371
01:47:52,799 --> 01:47:54,841
That is enough for me.

1372
01:47:55,425 --> 01:47:56,758
I'll come again.

1373
01:48:02,824 --> 01:48:04,741
What's going on?

1374
01:48:04,831 --> 01:48:06,748
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1375
01:48:06,859 --> 01:48:08,318
Kailash is brother's friend.

1376
01:48:08,651 --> 01:48:10,693
I am trying to save him from ruin.

1377
01:48:10,857 --> 01:48:13,232
Are you trying to save him,
or trapping yourself?

1378
01:48:13,355 --> 01:48:14,730
[Laughing]

1379
01:48:27,862 --> 01:48:30,487
Ragini! since when have
you been waiting here?

1380
01:48:30,895 --> 01:48:35,340
Sit. Why are you staring like that?

1381
01:48:37,023 --> 01:48:40,444
I am trying to believe what I see.

1382
01:48:40,998 --> 01:48:44,456
Is a husband worshiped
like God in this day and age?

1383
01:48:44,625 --> 01:48:45,917
Come, sit down.

1384
01:48:48,410 --> 01:48:52,285
You have come to see us after so
many days, and he is not in town.

1385
01:48:53,232 --> 01:48:56,190
- Not in town?
- Yes, he has gone out.

1386
01:48:56,646 --> 01:48:59,771
- But where?
- He doesn't tell me.

1387
01:49:00,168 --> 01:49:03,333
He must have gone
somewhere on business. Okay.

1388
01:49:04,217 --> 01:49:07,592
How do you know he
has gone out of town?

1389
01:49:08,125 --> 01:49:13,584
Naturally. If he was here,
would he stay away from me?

1390
01:49:14,839 --> 01:49:17,131
You trust your husband so much?

1391
01:49:17,649 --> 01:49:20,816
If I don't trust my God, who will I?

1392
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:23,530
Sit.

1393
01:49:26,274 --> 01:49:27,149
Listen, Sita.

1394
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:30,448
I have come to tell you
that is not out of town.

1395
01:49:30,532 --> 01:49:33,199
- He is in this city.
- This city?

1396
01:49:33,467 --> 01:49:35,592
- Where?
- In a hotel.

1397
01:49:35,990 --> 01:49:41,946
Hotel? But he hates hotel food.

1398
01:49:42,833 --> 01:49:44,624
Is he alright?

1399
01:49:44,725 --> 01:49:48,825
He looks fine. But I have
come to ask you something.

1400
01:49:49,211 --> 01:49:51,336
The one who cannot
stay away from you...

1401
01:49:51,651 --> 01:49:54,271
why is he staying away
from you in a hotel?

1402
01:49:55,108 --> 01:49:57,983
He is not a fault.

1403
01:49:58,113 --> 01:49:59,321
Why?

1404
01:49:59,910 --> 01:50:03,743
Actually, in big homes, many
problems are often created.

1405
01:50:04,859 --> 01:50:08,943
He may not have been able
to bear all the problems.

1406
01:50:09,655 --> 01:50:12,196
And must have gone away
from home for a few days.

1407
01:50:12,292 --> 01:50:13,292
Okay.

1408
01:50:13,324 --> 01:50:16,866
He may have left home,
but why has he left you?

1409
01:50:17,168 --> 01:50:21,626
A few days back, he had himself
told me his wife is an angel.

1410
01:50:22,432 --> 01:50:27,182
See! I told you, he
loves me very much.

1411
01:50:27,297 --> 01:50:31,905
That love does not exist any more.
You have been distanced from him.

1412
01:50:32,695 --> 01:50:36,663
Forgive me, my words may hurt you...

1413
01:50:37,201 --> 01:50:42,617
but I have come to tell you
your husband wants to marry again.

1414
01:50:45,196 --> 01:50:49,780
[Sobbing]

1415
01:50:55,781 --> 01:50:57,490
If that can...

1416
01:51:02,123 --> 01:51:06,498
give him happiness,
who can stop him?

1417
01:51:06,914 --> 01:51:12,998
- Law!
- What law can stop him from being happy?

1418
01:51:13,196 --> 01:51:18,574
A law that our elders
have made to protect you.

1419
01:51:19,417 --> 01:51:21,459
A law that stops men from
having a second marriage.

1420
01:51:22,039 --> 01:51:25,847
What if I give consent for
the sake of his happiness?

1421
01:51:27,238 --> 01:51:30,196
Sita, these are
talks of blind faith.

1422
01:51:30,375 --> 01:51:32,000
Times have changed.

1423
01:51:32,690 --> 01:51:33,982
Ragini.

1424
01:51:34,576 --> 01:51:39,201
Love and devotion to husband
does not change with times.

1425
01:51:39,908 --> 01:51:43,033
He never does anything
without due thought.

1426
01:51:44,155 --> 01:51:46,321
It is probably all my fault.

1427
01:51:46,667 --> 01:51:50,875
I only could not give him
the happiness he desires.

1428
01:51:51,765 --> 01:51:59,265
I am an old fashioned woman
who cannot think beyond her home.

1429
01:51:59,948 --> 01:52:04,406
I can neither go out with him,
nor help him in his work.

1430
01:52:04,808 --> 01:52:06,558
Nor can I give him any happiness.

1431
01:52:08,449 --> 01:52:12,824
If he finds such a woman
who can give him all this...

1432
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:17,959
I will pray to God that he is happy.

1433
01:52:19,427 --> 01:52:24,510
And I spend the rest of
my days worshiping him.

1434
01:52:25,688 --> 01:52:29,022
Sita, you are an angel.

1435
01:52:29,490 --> 01:52:33,948
Your picture should be in
this temple instead of Kailash.

1436
01:52:35,443 --> 01:52:39,776
It is angels like you
that make our country proud.

1437
01:52:40,357 --> 01:52:42,273
That will make our culture immortal.

1438
01:52:43,670 --> 01:52:48,795
I am sure today,
that no one can harm

1439
01:52:49,363 --> 01:52:55,113
Sita, I salute you!

1440
01:52:55,613 --> 01:52:58,988
[Sobbing]

1441
01:53:03,988 --> 01:53:06,196
I am sure I must have
made some mistake...

1442
01:53:06,949 --> 01:53:09,324
or you would not
distance yourself from me.

1443
01:53:10,298 --> 01:53:12,840
I apologise for this mistake.

1444
01:53:13,717 --> 01:53:19,175
Whatever punishment
you give me, I accept it.

1445
01:53:35,631 --> 01:53:38,547
- When did you come?
- It would be better if I hadn't, right?

1446
01:53:38,615 --> 01:53:42,448
What rubbish! Despite being in
the city, you didn't come home.

1447
01:53:42,631 --> 01:53:44,756
Should I come everyday to see you?

1448
01:53:44,905 --> 01:53:48,405
No, so that I see you everyday,
and to eat your meals.

1449
01:53:48,541 --> 01:53:51,458
- I'll get food for you.
- Yes, mix some poison in it.

1450
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:53,167
Why do you talk like that?

1451
01:53:57,795 --> 01:53:59,253
I'll keep it myself.

1452
01:53:59,483 --> 01:54:01,483
You don't have the
habit of doing this.

1453
01:54:01,581 --> 01:54:03,789
- I'll keep it.
- I said I'll do it!

1454
01:54:05,531 --> 01:54:07,740
I told you! Move!

1455
01:54:10,652 --> 01:54:15,235
You don't have to tell me anything,
Ragini told me.

1456
01:54:15,891 --> 01:54:18,225
Mom, get up. Kailash has come.

1457
01:54:18,625 --> 01:54:23,064
I swear, I will
never come in your way.

1458
01:54:23,862 --> 01:54:27,987
- You can marry again.
- I don't need your permission.

1459
01:54:28,581 --> 01:54:34,081
But I need you. Visit me sometimes.

1460
01:54:34,233 --> 01:54:37,858
Don't put on that virtuous act.
Don't try to fool me.

1461
01:54:38,031 --> 01:54:40,531
- You sinner!
- What did you say? Sinner?

1462
01:54:40,615 --> 01:54:44,365
Yes! You are a dagger
dipped in honey.

1463
01:54:44,498 --> 01:54:48,539
This is a home of sin.
Everyone living here is a snake.

1464
01:54:48,651 --> 01:54:52,818
And even if you all are burned,
there is no sin in it!

1465
01:54:53,175 --> 01:54:55,925
I am ready to die a
thousand times for you.

1466
01:54:56,444 --> 01:55:00,819
But I am carrying your baby.

1467
01:55:00,909 --> 01:55:04,117
I you keep talking like that,
I will kill you!

1468
01:55:09,117 --> 01:55:12,742
But before leaving, at least
tell me what wrong have I done?

1469
01:55:12,819 --> 01:55:13,944
What sin have I committed?

1470
01:55:14,031 --> 01:55:16,490
Your wrong,
your sin is that deceit...

1471
01:55:16,573 --> 01:55:18,823
which no wife can give her husband

1472
01:55:18,883 --> 01:55:24,425
No, I swear I have committed no sin.

1473
01:55:24,523 --> 01:55:27,940
If I have unknowingly
made a mistake, tell me...

1474
01:55:28,030 --> 01:55:29,821
I am ready to suffer punishment.

1475
01:55:30,065 --> 01:55:32,982
I don't want to mention
your sin and defile my tongue.

1476
01:55:33,071 --> 01:55:34,363
You are cheap, you are a sinner.

1477
01:55:34,446 --> 01:55:37,633
I won't let you go
until you tell me my crime.

1478
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:40,241
- What is my crime?
- Get lost!

1479
01:55:41,031 --> 01:55:43,448
[Crying]

1480
01:55:43,948 --> 01:55:47,740
This boy has defeated me too in
screaming and creating a scene.

1481
01:55:47,824 --> 01:55:51,282
What else could he do?
She must have troubled him.

1482
01:55:51,812 --> 01:55:56,896
I am waiting for him to come,
and you are showing him the door?

1483
01:55:57,066 --> 01:56:02,316
- What did you do?
- Something must be lacking in my worship...

1484
01:56:03,125 --> 01:56:08,167
in my prayer. He abused me and left.

1485
01:56:08,383 --> 01:56:11,425
[Crying]

1486
01:56:13,128 --> 01:56:17,628
When uncle comes to take aunt
back home, how does she cry?

1487
01:56:17,795 --> 01:56:23,003
[Crying]

1488
01:56:23,802 --> 01:56:26,927
Mom, Pappu and Gappu
are imitating us.

1489
01:56:27,211 --> 01:56:29,128
- What!
- Yes. Come and see for yourself.

1490
01:56:29,234 --> 01:56:30,901
Gappu, come here.

1491
01:56:32,125 --> 01:56:34,792
How does grandma ask
for tea in the morning?

1492
01:56:34,882 --> 01:56:36,007
Watch!

1493
01:56:36,844 --> 01:56:42,969
Sita! Where have you disappeared?
No one cares for me.

1494
01:56:43,851 --> 01:56:46,185
You idiot! You are imitating me?

1495
01:56:46,420 --> 01:56:48,592
[Yelling]

1496
01:56:52,709 --> 01:56:54,792
Mother! They are kids, not animals.

1497
01:56:56,258 --> 01:56:58,592
What good kids you have sired.

1498
01:56:58,709 --> 01:57:02,042
You are a barren woman, what
do you know of a mother's pain.

1499
01:57:02,468 --> 01:57:08,677
- Mom, did you hear that?
- Don't cry, dear.

1500
01:57:09,086 --> 01:57:13,685
You curse my daughter in
my presence! I'll break your bones!

1501
01:57:13,874 --> 01:57:16,166
- You bitch! You...
- Mother!

1502
01:57:16,990 --> 01:57:19,698
What's going on?
Why are you fighting?

1503
01:57:19,765 --> 01:57:23,099
You don't interfere. We gave
shelter to this orphaned woman...

1504
01:57:23,198 --> 01:57:26,687
give her food. But
she is bullying me now.

1505
01:57:26,775 --> 01:57:29,942
Who is an orphan? Even my kids
have a right over this house.

1506
01:57:30,151 --> 01:57:32,943
They are grandsons of Rai
Bahadur Ramdas, not beggars.

1507
01:57:33,039 --> 01:57:37,789
Oh yes, go on talking! It's
time for you to leave now.

1508
01:57:37,905 --> 01:57:41,254
You talk of rights? I
won't give you a penny!

1509
01:57:41,349 --> 01:57:42,682
Get out of my house!

1510
01:57:42,758 --> 01:57:46,217
Shanta, you have grown old.
Show some sense now at least.

1511
01:57:46,308 --> 01:57:50,100
That is what has to be decided
today, as to who behaves sensibly.

1512
01:57:50,206 --> 01:57:52,748
How much I curse her, yet
she keeps her eyes closed.

1513
01:57:52,824 --> 01:57:56,949
Yes, the one who should keep his
eyes open, his eyes are closed.

1514
01:57:57,066 --> 01:57:59,788
Only the one who talks
rules in this house.

1515
01:57:59,894 --> 01:58:03,269
Yes, I rule here! Get out of here.

1516
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:07,985
- I'll leave right away!
- Sister, don't talk like that.

1517
01:58:08,083 --> 01:58:10,541
Sita, you only
convince her. Take her inside.

1518
01:58:10,657 --> 01:58:16,009
- Come inside, sister.
- No! She will not stay here.

1519
01:58:16,117 --> 01:58:21,076
Let me go, don't stop me.
No one can be happy here.

1520
01:58:21,319 --> 01:58:23,944
He is elder in name only,
he has no right.

1521
01:58:24,025 --> 01:58:27,817
Who are you to talk
of rights? Get out!

1522
01:58:27,908 --> 01:58:33,408
Disgusting! This family is a shame!
I don't know what to do.

1523
01:58:33,643 --> 01:58:35,143
I am not even dying!

1524
01:58:38,391 --> 01:58:41,239
Kamal, don't go in. Danger!
Red signal!

1525
01:58:41,361 --> 01:58:42,778
- What's the matter?
- Matter.

1526
01:58:44,452 --> 01:58:50,744
Whatever God wills! No,
it is all my ill-fate.

1527
01:59:03,084 --> 01:59:04,500
Good morning, dad.

1528
01:59:10,151 --> 01:59:15,084
Shameless! Being my son,
you blow smoke in my face?

1529
01:59:19,350 --> 01:59:21,933
- Whatever God wills!
- No father.

1530
01:59:22,894 --> 01:59:25,269
From now on, what you desire
will be done in this home.

1531
01:59:25,672 --> 01:59:28,057
You have raised your hand for
the first time in life, father.

1532
01:59:28,081 --> 01:59:30,623
It should never be put down.
Again. Come inside!

1533
01:59:30,804 --> 01:59:33,471
Turn the mess in your home to peace.

1534
01:59:33,650 --> 01:59:36,067
Light the lamps of
happiness and peace in your home.

1535
01:59:36,620 --> 01:59:37,953
Here's your weapon!

1536
01:59:40,044 --> 01:59:41,669
Whatever God wills!

1537
01:59:42,633 --> 01:59:43,883
Hail father!

1538
01:59:44,995 --> 01:59:48,328
Don't stop me, sister.
Rather than live in this house...

1539
01:59:48,475 --> 01:59:49,975
it is better my
kids beg and survive.

1540
01:59:50,066 --> 01:59:53,441
Why should your kids beg? They
are the heirs of this family.

1541
01:59:53,560 --> 01:59:55,684
Even they have a share in
their grandfather's property.

1542
01:59:55,708 --> 02:00:01,958
Oh great! Mom, listen! Usha
is talking of legal rights.

1543
02:00:02,608 --> 02:00:06,816
Why not? She is a
lawyer's daughter after all.

1544
02:00:06,889 --> 02:00:12,180
I will teach you law! You
all are conspiring against me?

1545
02:00:12,393 --> 02:00:15,685
I'll tell you who has what
right here. Get out all of you!

1546
02:00:15,795 --> 02:00:18,878
If any of you comes back,
I'll break your legs.

1547
02:00:18,998 --> 02:00:24,379
Wait! Don't any of you dare
to move! All of you go inside!

1548
02:00:24,443 --> 02:00:27,276
I am asking them to leave,
and you are stopping them?

1549
02:00:27,374 --> 02:00:28,624
Shut-up!

1550
02:00:29,878 --> 02:00:33,336
You cannot control your sons,
silence your daughters-in-law...

1551
02:00:33,450 --> 02:00:34,713
and are ordering me?

1552
02:00:34,787 --> 02:00:37,935
Speak to me with respect.
Don't make me angry!

1553
02:00:38,023 --> 02:00:41,815
- Go inside!
- I'll beat them first, then go in.

1554
02:00:41,946 --> 02:00:44,446
[Yelling]

1555
02:00:44,553 --> 02:00:45,594
Mother.

1556
02:00:45,709 --> 02:00:51,334
Kamal, move! Get up,
Shanta! Will you get up or not?

1557
02:00:51,417 --> 02:00:54,584
I'm getting up. What's
wrong with you today?

1558
02:00:54,667 --> 02:00:55,959
What has happened!

1559
02:00:56,065 --> 02:00:59,232
Remember you said the other
day that I don't have guts?

1560
02:00:59,331 --> 02:01:02,956
Where is my male ego? I
am showing you my ego.

1561
02:01:03,030 --> 02:01:05,530
What fate! I had to get beaten
in the presence of my sons...

1562
02:01:05,613 --> 02:01:09,238
daughters-in-law, grandchildren.

1563
02:01:09,782 --> 02:01:13,032
You talk of fate? You deserve this!

1564
02:01:13,383 --> 02:01:15,592
As an elder, I gave you the right.

1565
02:01:15,827 --> 02:01:18,327
But you bully everyone.

1566
02:01:18,442 --> 02:01:23,608
Gappu, Pappu, who is
going to study? Go to school!

1567
02:01:23,733 --> 02:01:24,983
Yes grandpa.

1568
02:01:26,791 --> 02:01:29,249
You are the elder
daughter-in-law of this house.

1569
02:01:29,341 --> 02:01:31,007
Is this how responsible you are?

1570
02:01:31,133 --> 02:01:34,925
How could a decent woman
think of stepping out of home?

1571
02:01:35,568 --> 02:01:42,234
Go inside! And listen, appoint a
cook, a gardener, and a servant.

1572
02:01:42,456 --> 02:01:45,081
All the house chores will be
done under your supervision.

1573
02:01:45,456 --> 02:01:46,956
- Go.
- Yes father.

1574
02:01:49,803 --> 02:01:53,428
Sita, how many times have I told
you not go up & down the stairs...

1575
02:01:53,518 --> 02:01:56,226
in your condition.

1576
02:01:56,869 --> 02:02:00,036
There is no need for you to
get down hereafter Go upstairs.

1577
02:02:01,377 --> 02:02:06,044
Usha, taking care of
Sita is your responsibility.

1578
02:02:06,461 --> 02:02:07,545
Yes.

1579
02:02:09,380 --> 02:02:15,713
Wait! Who taught you to be
rude to your mother-in-law?

1580
02:02:19,917 --> 02:02:22,875
Oh, so you taught her that?

1581
02:02:23,217 --> 02:02:24,633
- Kamal.
- Yes.

1582
02:02:24,725 --> 02:02:29,100
I'll deal with you later. Go to
office and bring Kailash home.

1583
02:02:29,197 --> 02:02:31,822
- I'll set him right!
- Okay.

1584
02:02:33,233 --> 02:02:36,066
- Shall I ask you something?
- What?

1585
02:02:36,675 --> 02:02:39,883
- Where were your guts until now?
- I said go!

1586
02:02:47,967 --> 02:02:50,550
Hail grandpa!

1587
02:02:54,073 --> 02:02:55,531
Whatever God wills!

1588
02:02:56,584 --> 02:02:57,959
Shanta.

1589
02:02:58,675 --> 02:03:05,758
[Tomtom]

1590
02:03:09,561 --> 02:03:14,227
Bless you, dear. Good you came home.

1591
02:03:14,372 --> 02:03:16,288
She didn't come, she
was forced to come.

1592
02:03:16,399 --> 02:03:20,358
Or she would be beaten to death.

1593
02:03:20,498 --> 02:03:24,081
Okay, so her mother got angry again.

1594
02:03:24,157 --> 02:03:29,866
No, she turned to ice. But my
father-in-law was angry today.

1595
02:03:29,951 --> 02:03:30,951
Is it?

1596
02:03:31,019 --> 02:03:36,061
Yes father. It seemed like
Lord Shiva came in his dream...

1597
02:03:36,128 --> 02:03:40,878
and asked him to send
Bhairavi to her husband's home.

1598
02:03:41,224 --> 02:03:45,849
And also told him to tell you
you have served music enough now.

1599
02:03:45,933 --> 02:03:49,725
So you should only pray to
God now. Isn't it, Bhairavi?

1600
02:03:49,816 --> 02:03:54,983
- Yes father.
- Then hang this up there.

1601
02:03:55,089 --> 02:03:58,422
Hail God Shankar!

1602
02:04:04,703 --> 02:04:08,662
- Sir, junior has come to meet you.
- I don't want to meet him.

1603
02:04:10,776 --> 02:04:12,943
Tell him I am busy and am
leaving for Bombay today.

1604
02:04:13,948 --> 02:04:16,698
- But sir...
- I told you! Get out!

1605
02:04:24,734 --> 02:04:27,484
- Sir...
- I heard.

1606
02:04:30,951 --> 02:04:34,076
What did you say? He
refused to meet you?

1607
02:04:34,752 --> 02:04:39,169
I know everything. His
deeds have reached my ears.

1608
02:04:39,493 --> 02:04:41,868
I'll take charge of
office today itself.

1609
02:04:42,054 --> 02:04:46,679
Father, call a lady doctor
immediately. Sita is in labour.

1610
02:05:01,164 --> 02:05:04,539
Shanta, come soon,
Sita has gone in labour.

1611
02:05:04,709 --> 02:05:07,750
Why should I come? What
do I mean to this family?

1612
02:05:07,873 --> 02:05:11,664
What rubbish are you talking?
You have a right over this family.

1613
02:05:11,748 --> 02:05:17,581
Oh yes! Where were my rights
when you beat me that day?

1614
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:22,967
Misuse of power can
bring down even emperors.

1615
02:05:23,572 --> 02:05:29,489
You should behave in such a
way that everyone loves you...

1616
02:05:29,666 --> 02:05:31,249
not fears you.

1617
02:05:32,041 --> 02:05:36,916
A mother-in-law is like a mother,
and she should stay in her limits.

1618
02:05:36,998 --> 02:05:41,539
I will stay in my limits.
Come what may, I won't get up.

1619
02:05:42,098 --> 02:05:47,556
You are under a wrong notion.

1620
02:05:48,339 --> 02:05:50,547
You think this home
cannot run without you?

1621
02:05:51,117 --> 02:05:52,659
Sita won't deliver without you?

1622
02:05:53,276 --> 02:05:57,359
Watch how this home
runs without you.

1623
02:05:58,107 --> 02:06:01,612
- Bhairavi!
- Yes.

1624
02:06:01,737 --> 02:06:06,650
Go quickly and bring 4 lady doctors,
6 midwives and 8 nurses.

1625
02:06:06,728 --> 02:06:08,019
I'll just bring them, father.

1626
02:06:09,718 --> 02:06:11,177
Let's see!

1627
02:06:11,845 --> 02:06:13,782
[Baby Crying]

1628
02:06:15,234 --> 02:06:17,818
Father, a son has been delivered.

1629
02:06:18,602 --> 02:06:22,311
Son! Who cares for me in this home?

1630
02:06:22,593 --> 02:06:24,218
I'm nobody.

1631
02:06:24,508 --> 02:06:29,800
- Hail Sita aunt's son!
- Sita aunt has delivered a son!

1632
02:06:29,875 --> 02:06:31,667
And Usha aunt will deliver a girl.

1633
02:06:31,725 --> 02:06:35,934
No! if she turns out to
be like your grandma...

1634
02:06:36,042 --> 02:06:38,875
some poor man's
state will be like mine.

1635
02:06:38,940 --> 02:06:40,148
Whatever God wills!

1636
02:06:40,240 --> 02:06:42,281
[Laughing]

1637
02:06:45,628 --> 02:06:48,253
Mother, open the door.

1638
02:06:52,135 --> 02:06:54,010
The baby has taken after you.

1639
02:06:54,901 --> 02:06:57,068
Don't tell me. Go away!

1640
02:06:57,559 --> 02:06:59,517
You have not eaten
anything since yesterday.

1641
02:06:59,779 --> 02:07:02,112
I have brought sweets. Eat some.

1642
02:07:03,534 --> 02:07:06,451
The love you express!
I don't want to eat!

1643
02:07:10,896 --> 02:07:11,896
Mother,

1644
02:07:13,273 --> 02:07:14,357
Give it to me.

1645
02:07:16,570 --> 02:07:18,737
- Open the door.
- Okay.

1646
02:07:31,781 --> 02:07:34,740
"Grandma, please relent"

1647
02:07:35,285 --> 02:07:38,118

"Stop being angry, now smile!"

"Stop being angry, now smile!"

1652
02:07:52,967 --> 02:07:56,383
"Grandma, please relent"

1653
02:08:03,527 --> 02:08:07,474
"Don't get annoyed over small things"

1654
02:08:10,508 --> 02:08:13,800
"Don't get annoyed
over small things"

1655
02:08:13,956 --> 02:08:17,331
"When you get angry,
drink cold water"

1656

"Grandma, we will appease you"

This is your useless father, Ramdas.
You won't get money.

The necklace I bought
from Bombay, give it to me.

Playing a trick? Who did
you give the necklace to?

I'll kill you! Tell me!

Kailash! What behavior is this?

1702
02:12:29,674 --> 02:12:31,531
Don't you feel ashamed
to raise your hand on her?

- I'll kill her!
- Are you human, or a devil?

1704
02:12:35,613 --> 02:12:38,342
I may be a devil, but
you are responsible for it!

1705
02:12:38,460 --> 02:12:41,668
You have made me a beggar.
You have humiliated me.

1706
02:12:41,959 --> 02:12:44,117
You are forgetting that even I
have a share in this company.

02:12:52,016 --> 02:12:54,391
In your passion of youth,
you are forgetting your father?

Forgetting this home?

1713
02:12:55,980 --> 02:12:58,397
Father, he has come
home after many days.

Don't tell him anything.

- Wait! Where are you going?
- Away from this hell!

1716

This home is hell? The
home you were born in...

the home in which there is a
daughter-in-law like Sita...

that place as heaven...

how our honour is being slurred.
This place is worse than hell.

even seen your son's face yet.

Now do you realise that you
are the cause of this ruin?

your daughters-in-law...

the way you snatched their freedom..

The way you restricted their
laughing and having fun...

1747
02:15:04,057 --> 02:15:05,974
this is a result of all that.

a mother-in-law like you...

02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:37,515
- Now come home.
- To see that cheap woman's love act with you?

1833
02:22:41,618 --> 02:22:46,077
You rascal who
slurred my honour! Go away!

1834
02:22:56,451 --> 02:22:58,826
Even I can hit you.
But if I hit you...

1835
02:22:59,028 --> 02:23:03,361
my sister-in-law will be hurt.

1836
02:23:04,193 --> 02:23:08,068
Even if I die, I'll
take you to sister-in-law!

1837
02:23:08,175 --> 02:23:10,175
- I will help her get justice.
- Justice?

1838
02:23:10,367 --> 02:23:13,034
Only death is justice
for sinners like you.

1839
02:23:15,104 --> 02:23:20,148
Kailash! what behavior is that?
Kamal, please leave.

1840
02:23:20,240 --> 02:23:22,437
Heed me, Kamal. Leave for now.

1841
02:23:22,552 --> 02:23:25,010
You have your parents
promise, leave.

1842
02:23:31,631 --> 02:23:35,381
Ragini, I feel
suffocated in this world of sin.

1843
02:23:35,893 --> 02:23:39,435
Let us go somewhere where
there is just you and me.

1844
02:23:40,258 --> 02:23:43,508
Wherever you may go,
you will feel suffocated.

1845
02:23:44,115 --> 02:23:46,281
Because you are being
unfair to sister-in-law Sita.

1846
02:23:46,381 --> 02:23:50,547
Sita, your sister-in-law?
When did I become your brother?

1847
02:23:50,685 --> 02:23:52,435
Since you got married.

1848
02:23:53,693 --> 02:23:57,234
Had you used your brains,
you would have understood.

1849
02:23:57,701 --> 02:24:01,510
My brains are not working now.
The one I married...

1850
02:24:01,609 --> 02:24:05,193
loves my brother. The one I
love calls herself my sister.

1851
02:24:05,626 --> 02:24:07,543
Had I not treated Sita
as my sister-in-law..

1852
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:09,182
I would feel ashamed
to call you my brother.

1853
02:24:09,206 --> 02:24:12,748
Then why did you
accept my gifts and jewelry?

1854
02:24:13,862 --> 02:24:19,154
If I hadn't you would lose
it to some wrong person.

1855
02:24:19,886 --> 02:24:22,053
I took it as a treasure
of Sita for safe keeping.

1856
02:24:22,152 --> 02:24:26,694
- You cheat!
- Kailash! you have stooped so low?

1857
02:24:26,792 --> 02:24:27,959
Father!

1858
02:24:30,941 --> 02:24:35,691
Child, I know you wanted
to marry Kailash once.

1859
02:24:35,843 --> 02:24:40,468
If that couldn't happen, you want
to snatch him from his wife now?

1860
02:24:40,893 --> 02:24:42,685
Even you are a woman after all.

1861
02:24:43,007 --> 02:24:47,757
Snatching another woman's
husband is a crime, a sin.

1862
02:24:48,042 --> 02:24:53,917
I'll give you, whatever you want.

1863
02:24:54,271 --> 02:24:58,229
Please return my
daughter-in-law's husband.

1864
02:24:58,436 --> 02:25:00,394
Return my son to me.

1865
02:25:02,175 --> 02:25:04,467
There is no difference
between the father and son.

1866
02:25:04,952 --> 02:25:08,911
I neither needed your money,
nor your son.

1867
02:25:09,219 --> 02:25:11,803
I have only kept
them safely with me...

1868
02:25:12,512 --> 02:25:16,262
so that when the time comes, I
can return them to that angel...

1869
02:25:16,877 --> 02:25:18,169
who they belong to.

1870
02:25:19,138 --> 02:25:21,971
Your son is here. Take him away.

1871
02:25:22,417 --> 02:25:24,792
And if possible, make him human.

1872
02:25:25,026 --> 02:25:27,651
And your jewelry,
I'll get it right away.

1873
02:25:30,482 --> 02:25:34,773
Kailash enough now. I
cannot take it anymore.

1874
02:25:34,870 --> 02:25:39,787
Come home. Sita is a
chaste woman. She is an angel.

1875
02:25:39,893 --> 02:25:43,685
You may see her as chaste, I don't.

1876
02:25:43,811 --> 02:25:48,936
She is a sinner who will
burn in her own sin one day!

1877
02:25:49,051 --> 02:25:55,551
No Kailash, it is a sin to
accuse a good woman like that.

1878
02:25:55,659 --> 02:26:00,117
It will destroy your home,
your whole family.

1879
02:26:01,078 --> 02:26:05,203
Kailash, after your
elder brother's death...

1880
02:26:05,685 --> 02:26:08,226
I left everything in your care...

1881
02:26:08,591 --> 02:26:10,299
and retired.

1882
02:26:11,099 --> 02:26:15,640
In this old age, I
cannot afford to lose you.

1883
02:26:16,708 --> 02:26:19,791
Come home and save your Sita.

1884
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:23,375
You want to save your
chaste daughter-in-law.

1885
02:26:23,498 --> 02:26:27,415
Where were you when
she was tormenting me?

1886
02:26:27,526 --> 02:26:30,026
When she was destroying
my happiness.

1887
02:26:30,924 --> 02:26:35,424
When she was having an affair
with Kamal, where were you then?

1888
02:26:35,473 --> 02:26:37,557
Kailash! what have you said!!

1889
02:26:39,640 --> 02:26:45,807
You are accusing Sita and Kamal?
I could thrash you for this!

1890
02:26:46,038 --> 02:26:50,455
But my old hands don't
have the strength anymore.

1891
02:26:53,475 --> 02:26:55,725
I have that strength, father.

1892
02:26:56,209 --> 02:26:59,417
Kailash, take back your words.

1893
02:27:00,881 --> 02:27:02,172
Take them back!

1894
02:27:03,558 --> 02:27:06,433
Sarang, this is my family matter,
you don't interfere.

1895
02:27:06,508 --> 02:27:09,711
Shut-up! This is my family
matter too. Sita is my sister.

1896
02:27:09,802 --> 02:27:11,593
Apologise for what you said!

1897
02:27:11,792 --> 02:27:13,209
I said apologise!

1898
02:27:15,183 --> 02:27:20,600
Sarang, Kamal
escaped me. But you won't.

1899
02:27:24,367 --> 02:27:27,492
Kamal let you off
because you are his brother.

1900
02:27:27,568 --> 02:27:31,651
I won't spare you! I am
the son-in-law. I can do it!

1901
02:27:31,766 --> 02:27:33,600
- Salan!
- Leave me, father.

1902
02:27:33,690 --> 02:27:36,857
Take back your words,
or prove your charge.

1903
02:27:37,272 --> 02:27:39,897
- I have proof.
- You do? - Yes.

1904
02:27:40,023 --> 02:27:44,548
- I can prove it.
- Okay, but not here, before the whole family.

1905
02:27:44,677 --> 02:27:47,302
Ragini, you also come along. Father.

1906
02:27:47,393 --> 02:27:50,560
- Kailash?
- Nothing doing, come home.

1907
02:27:56,318 --> 02:27:59,359
Kamal! how come you are bleeding?

1908
02:27:59,447 --> 02:28:02,113
- Mother!
- What is this blood, son!

1909
02:28:03,925 --> 02:28:06,050
Why don't you tell me what happened?

1910
02:28:08,425 --> 02:28:13,008
Mom, brother has misunderstood
my and Sita's relationship.

1911
02:28:13,713 --> 02:28:16,171
He has slurred a mother
and son's relationship.

1912
02:28:22,073 --> 02:28:23,323
Sister-in-law!

1913
02:28:32,886 --> 02:28:36,219
Kailash, it would have been
better if you had died at birth.

1914
02:28:36,318 --> 02:28:39,193
Yes, definitely.

1915
02:28:39,291 --> 02:28:41,083
How can you suspect
your younger brother?

1916
02:28:41,187 --> 02:28:43,128
You sling mud on brother-in-law

1917
02:28:43,192 --> 02:28:46,608
- Mom, don't say anymore, or...
- Mother, don't say anything.

1918
02:28:47,468 --> 02:28:51,968
Kailash, you said you
have proof. Where is it?

1919
02:28:52,084 --> 02:28:55,042
Why ask me? Ask your wife.

1920
02:28:55,975 --> 02:28:59,641
Bhairavi, why don't
you say what you know?

1921
02:29:00,014 --> 02:29:05,305
She won't tell you like that.
Bhairavi, tell me.

1922
02:29:05,388 --> 02:29:06,929
Tell the truth.

1923
02:29:08,185 --> 02:29:11,810
- Speak up, or I'll kill you!
- Why don't you speak?

1924
02:29:13,625 --> 02:29:16,250
Kamal and Sita were talking one day.

1925
02:29:17,007 --> 02:29:18,882
I was listening secretly.

1926
02:29:19,527 --> 02:29:24,485
Kailash arrived suddenly.
In fear, I told him lies.

1927
02:29:24,909 --> 02:29:27,742
But what were they talking?
What did you hear?

1928
02:29:28,507 --> 02:29:32,966
Kamal always told Sita
about his meetings with Usha.

1929
02:29:33,265 --> 02:29:35,390
Even that day, he
was talking about her.

1930
02:29:35,633 --> 02:29:39,758
But sister-in-law didn't
want to listen. Brother arrived.

1931
02:29:40,537 --> 02:29:42,245
That is all.

1932
02:29:42,390 --> 02:29:44,723
I am not so foolish to
suspect just over that.

1933
02:29:44,850 --> 02:29:47,684
I myself saw how Kamal wore a
necklace round Sita's neck...

1934
02:29:47,799 --> 02:29:52,341
- when they were alone.
- Didn't you see me there?

1935
02:29:52,417 --> 02:29:55,042
- Even I was present there.
- Lies! you were not there.

1936
02:29:55,141 --> 02:29:57,760
Then how would I
have taken this picture?

1937
02:29:57,902 --> 02:30:00,694
Kamal was wearing the necklace,
and I was taking a picture.

1938
02:30:01,112 --> 02:30:03,654
Alright, but where is
the necklace I gave Sita?

1939
02:30:03,959 --> 02:30:09,584
Necklace?...Is it this one?

1940
02:30:10,745 --> 02:30:13,370
How did it come to you?

1941
02:30:13,893 --> 02:30:17,226
How did it come to me?

1942
02:30:17,387 --> 02:30:23,178
Bhairavi, tell them how it came to me.

1943
02:30:23,443 --> 02:30:28,886
- Tell them!
- Mom! - Why don't you tell us?

1944
02:30:28,987 --> 02:30:33,669
I beat my Bhairavi
real hard. Are you hurt?

1945
02:30:33,758 --> 02:30:36,925
Tell them how I got this necklace.

1946
02:30:37,339 --> 02:30:38,131
[Crying]

1947
02:30:38,191 --> 02:30:43,149
Mom, I'm sorry. Brother bought
this necklace for Sita from Bombay

1948
02:30:43,626 --> 02:30:46,376
I asked him why he didn't
bring such a gift for me.

1949
02:30:46,995 --> 02:30:52,287
I liked the necklace very much.
So I took it from Sita's drawer.

1950
02:30:54,624 --> 02:30:57,665
Shameless girl! Why were you born!

1951
02:30:57,721 --> 02:31:01,604
I feel ashamed to
call you my daughter.

1952
02:31:02,988 --> 02:31:07,651
Brother, forgive me,
it is all my fault. Sita!

1953
02:31:07,752 --> 02:31:11,877
Mom, father, I made a mistake.
Forgive me.

1954
02:31:11,998 --> 02:31:15,623
I made a mistake.
Forgive me.

1955
02:31:15,699 --> 02:31:18,407
Forgive me.

1956
02:31:19,914 --> 02:31:22,789
Mother, wonder what
is wrong with Sita.

1957
02:31:22,905 --> 02:31:26,083
Since she fell down, she neither
speaks, nor looks at anybody.

1958
02:31:26,167 --> 02:31:27,834
Come soon, I'm scared.

1959
02:31:27,891 --> 02:31:29,016
Sita?

1960
02:31:30,696 --> 02:31:31,696
Sita!

1961
02:31:33,030 --> 02:31:34,113
Sita!

1962
02:31:37,907 --> 02:31:42,282
If brother thinks the
death of the son only...

1963
02:31:42,366 --> 02:31:46,840
can wash the slur on the mother,
I think I'd rather die.

1964
02:31:47,933 --> 02:31:54,075
It's my duty. Sister-in-law,
I've come to see you the last time.

1965
02:31:56,113 --> 02:32:00,004
Look at me once before I leave.

1966
02:32:01,530 --> 02:32:03,877
Just call my name once.

1967
02:32:06,655 --> 02:32:10,280
You won't call me?
You won't look at me?

1968
02:32:12,155 --> 02:32:13,571
Okay.

1969
02:32:22,678 --> 02:32:28,529
Kamal, forgive me!

1970
02:32:28,581 --> 02:32:30,240
Kamal.

1971
02:32:30,321 --> 02:32:32,905
Kamal.

1972
02:32:32,988 --> 02:32:34,488
Stop Kamal, Sita.

1973
02:32:34,532 --> 02:32:37,199
For my foolishness, he is
going to sacrifice his life.

1974
02:32:37,569 --> 02:32:40,324
Sita!
Only you can stop him, Sita.

1975
02:32:40,469 --> 02:32:43,928
- Kamal.
- Don't leave me and go.

1976
02:32:44,003 --> 02:32:47,711
Forgive me, I plead with you.

1977
02:32:47,816 --> 02:32:51,953
Save my brother. I fall at
your feet and apologize.

1978
02:32:52,196 --> 02:32:53,905
Husband, what are you doing!

1979
02:32:53,988 --> 02:32:55,321
Don't leave me!

1980
02:32:55,405 --> 02:33:00,488
Your son is leaving you,
your Kamal is leaving you.

1981
02:33:00,571 --> 02:33:02,159
Save him!

1982
02:33:02,268 --> 02:33:03,476
Kamal.

1983
02:33:04,594 --> 02:33:05,678
Kamal.

1984
02:33:05,854 --> 02:33:07,146
Sister-in-law!

1985
02:33:07,530 --> 02:33:08,530
Kamal.

1986
02:33:08,821 --> 02:33:10,071
Sister-in-law!

1987
02:33:10,374 --> 02:33:11,374
Kamal.

1988
02:33:11,420 --> 02:33:12,420
Sister-in-law!

1989
02:33:18,123 --> 02:33:21,998
Kamal, can you leave me?

1990
02:33:22,074 --> 02:33:26,676
Never! How can a
son leave his mother?

1991
02:33:27,276 --> 02:33:32,378
Sita, you are this family's angel.

1992
02:33:33,358 --> 02:33:37,894
Kamal, forgive me.
Brother.

1993
02:33:53,562 --> 02:33:57,771
"Hail Lord Ram and Sita!"

1994
02:33:57,847 --> 02:34:01,764
"Hail Lord Ram and Sita!"

1995
02:34:02,050 --> 02:34:06,175
"O eliminator of sorrow,
we worship you"

1996
02:34:06,336 --> 02:34:10,503
"O eliminator of sorrow,
we worship you"

1997
