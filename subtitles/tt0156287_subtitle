1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:10,460
I take refuge in Buddha

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:19,600
I take refuge in Dhamma

3
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:28,440
I take refuge in Sangha

4
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,970
When your invaluable heart is afraid

5
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,560
When it stumbles

6
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,020
Then, oh human, chant

7
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,260
I take refuge in Buddha

8
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,290
I take refuge in Dhamma

9
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,570
I take refuge in Sangha

10
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,860
When unrest plays its tune

11
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,180
When red blood is spilled

12
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,250
When the flames of violence rise

13
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,240
When humans become animals

14
00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:01,060
When people's smiles turn poisonous

15
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,750
Springtime has come

16
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,560
Flowers bloom in every forest

17
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,300
My cheery heart dances

18
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,060
Joy is all around

19
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,970
The bumblebee hums as
it kisses the buds

20
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,420
The buds remove
their veils and dance

21
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,320
The leaves on the
yellow peepul sway

22
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,820
Nobody is lonely today

23
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,270
It is the time of
union and bonding

24
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:34,020
With every step, her anklet rings

25
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,306
The maiden decks herself up

26
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,270
She adjusts her veil
and goes to her beloved

27
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,340
Shyness in her eyes,
love in her gestures

28
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,230
Acceptance in her heart,
refusal on her lips

29
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,160
lnstruments play

30
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,420
The water gun sprays colors

31
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:08,550
Today is the day of colors

32
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,020
Rain? In spring?

33
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,060
This is very inauspicious.

34
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,480
Surely trouble is on the way.

35
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,520
Congratulations, priest! It's a boy.

36
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,790
Really?

37
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,770
You've answered our prayers, God.

38
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,520
There's no end
to my happiness today.

39
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,220
- Bahuk!
- Yes?

40
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,680
Ask the royal astrologer
for his horoscope.

41
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,410
Here, your darling is
ten days old now. Bless him.

42
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,300
Long live, my son.
Make your clan proud.

43
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:37,879
- Greetings, royal priest.
- Greetings, royal astrologer.

44
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,820
Come in, please.

45
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,700
Greetings, royal astrologer.

46
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,920
Have a sweet.

47
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,470
What's the matter?

48
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,480
Sit down.

49
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,570
What does the horoscope say?

50
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,750
Why are you silent?

51
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,380
What can I say?

52
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,650
- Are his stars...
- Not aligned properly?

53
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,290
They're all wrong.

54
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,210
- His lifetime?
- Very long.

55
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,350
- Health?
- Well.

56
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,610
- Knowledge?
- Lots of it.

57
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,420
Then what's wrong with his stars?

58
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,520
This child will be a murderer.

59
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,340
His hands will slice many necks.

60
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:44,270
He brought storm and destruction
when he was born...

61
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,900
and it will always follow him.

62
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Every place he passes through
will be destroyed.

63
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,210
He'll thirst for human blood.

64
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,630
Oh God, what is this I hear?

65
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,440
Don't say that, astrologer.

66
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,700
God has given him to us
after a lot of worship.

67
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,890
Don't say that, astrologer.

68
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,210
It doesn't matter what I say.

69
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,000
The stars and his
horoscope have spoken.

70
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,450
Alright, I'm leaving.

71
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,940
I have to reach the court.

72
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,290
So do I.

73
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,240
The king wishes to bless the child.

74
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,060
How radiant his face is.

75
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:42,760
Astrologer, have you made our
little priest's horoscope?

76
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,730
- I have, my lord.
- How is his future?

77
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,020
- Horrible.
- What are you saying?

78
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,810
Yes, my lord.

79
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:56,990
His horoscope says he
will become a murderer.

80
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,600
A murderer?

81
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:05,780
Yes, my lord. His hands
will slice many necks.

82
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:12,570
Every place he passes
through will be destroyed.

83
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,020
This child will thirst
for human blood.

84
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,670
Child? He's a wolf!

85
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,600
This wolf should be
drowned in the Ganges!

86
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,810
Yes, he should be
killed before he kills.

87
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,820
My lord!

88
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,800
Please calm down.

89
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,460
Nobody can be punished
before they commit a crime.

90
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,420
And then, horoscopes can be wrong.

91
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,110
Praise the king.

92
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,560
My horoscopes have never been wrong.

93
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,450
Alright, astrologer.

94
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:54,040
But how can we strangle
a child who can't even move yet?

95
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,920
Yes, if he grows up
to be a sinner...

96
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,220
I'll teach him religion
until he's twelve.

97
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:08,650
And after that, I
will take him to my gurukul.

98
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,890
And the royal treasury
will pay for his education.

99
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,610
Praise the king.

100
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:21,070
Priest, what have you named him?'

101
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,750
My lord, his naming ceremony
has yet to take place.

102
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,080
Then name him Ahinsak (non-violent).

103
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:34,160
As you wish, my lord.
Ahinsak, who can never be violent.

104
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:39,070
Who can never give
grief to anyone. Ahinsak.

105
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:45,500
I will practice religion
and charity for his betterment.

106
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:58,480
Salutations to the god of Brahmins

107
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:08,190
Salutations to the creator of the world

108
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:18,490
Salutations to Krishna

109
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:31,380
Flute-carrying Gopal

110
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,830
My son takes refuge in you

111
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,520
He rests in your feet

112
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:15,820
Take care of him

113
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:54,420
My flower is fragile,
and your world, tough

114
00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:00,940
Kanha, take his sinking
boat to the shore

115
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,320
Oh sailor...

116
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,600
keep away trouble

117
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:55,260
Cleanse his sins with
the holy water from my eyes

118
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,640
I offer you my life.
Make my son immortal

119
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,210
May he light the torch
of peace in this world

120
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:27,690
May he make his country proud

121
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:04,650
I know. It's my son, Ahinsak.

122
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:10,430
You don't wear good clothes. Why?

123
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,340
- So that you're good.
- I'm not good now?

124
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:22,490
Of course you are.
I ask God to make you better.

125
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:27,519
Why don't you just ask me?
You'll tell God, he'll tell me.

126
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,250
Why go to all that trouble
for an easy task?

127
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,080
Rogue! I'll box your ears
before I take the easy way.

128
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,760
- What's going on?
- Father, mother's boxing my ears.

129
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,080
Alright. You're not ready yet?

130
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,830
Congratulations, your majesty.

131
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,330
Long live the princess.

132
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,840
Thank you, teacher.

133
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,380
Children with gifts for the
princess may step forward.

134
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,270
The chief minister's son, Maruti.

135
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,690
Take it, Mangala.

136
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,490
Lord Chandrasen's son, Dhanpal.

137
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:21,540
- Ahinsak.
- What a beautiful garland!

138
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,750
Thank you. Do you like flowers?

139
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,050
Yes. No, put it around my neck.

140
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,440
Do it.

141
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:41,220
I want to ask the children
a few questions.

142
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,250
- Ask, my lord.
- Will you answer them?

143
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,020
- Yes, my lord.
- They'll be difficult.

144
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,490
Alright, tell me, who is
man's biggest enemy?

145
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,390
- A lion.
- No. You?

146
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:59,220
- A snake.
- No, our fathers, who always hit us.

147
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,430
No, child. Fathers are like gods.

148
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,770
Alright, you tell me.

149
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,540
My lord, a man's biggest
enemy is anger.

150
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:17,200
Anger. Good. Who is a
man's best friend?

151
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,730
- Wealth.
- No, a sword.

152
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:25,640
- No, sweetballs.
- No. You tell me.

153
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,650
My lord, a man's best
friend is his religion.

154
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,880
- Wonderful! Royal astrologer?
- Yes, my lord?

155
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,980
Have you seen the
power of knowledge?

156
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,960
I apologize, my lord, but
the stars are powerful too.

157
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:47,220
Gyandutta, you've really bettered Ahinsak.

158
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,410
- Teacher?
- Yes, my lord?

159
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:57,420
You will take Ahinsak to the
gurukul today with the other children.

160
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,600
And the day he returns here,
even better than he is now...

161
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,110
will mark the victory of hard work
and ordination over destiny.

162
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,930
Son, your teacher
is now your father.

163
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:20,100
Respect him, study well,
and become a scholar.

164
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,350
But mother, how will I have a
mother like you in the gurukul?

165
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,570
Your teacher's wife
will be in the gurukul.

166
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,440
She'll be your mother.

167
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:38,280
See that you always
obey and serve her.

168
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,070
Will she love me like you do?

169
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:48,200
Yes, and you were alone here.
You'll have many brothers there.

170
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,140
Be good to them
and don't pick fights.

171
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:57,400
- I'm Ahinsak, mother.
- Yes, you are.

172
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,430
But parents' hearts are always worried.

173
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,270
Teacher, our only son
is with you now.

174
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:12,160
- Please forgive his mistakes.
- Don't worry, it'll be alright.

175
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,950
Come, son.

176
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,090
These are the children of Shravasti.

177
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,730
This is your gurumata.

178
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,340
- Maruti. - Long live.
- Dhanpal. - Long live.

179
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,580
- Krishna. - Long live.
- And this is Ahinsak.

180
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,570
- Long live, son, and stay happy.
- Come.

181
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:56,330
When I left home, my mother
said I'd have a new mother here.

182
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,770
Yes, son. This gurukul is your new
home, and she is your new mother.

183
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,250
Then I needn't worry.
You're just like my mother.

184
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,860
My blessings, son. Between
his teaching and my love...

185
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,230
you'll be perfect
when you return to your mother.

186
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,030
But mother, you aren't
much older than me.

187
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,390
You can't box my ears
like my mother does.

188
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,756
You idiot, age doesn't matter.
Of course I'll box your ears.

189
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,600
- But not too hard.
- Come.

190
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:28,300
- What kind of gurumata is she?
- She's barely older than us.

191
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:32,750
You're right, child. For years,
the gurukul had no mother.

192
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:36,980
The teacher accepted our
pleas, and we got her.

193
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,120
Now I get it.
The teacher married recently.

194
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,490
Alright, come on.

195
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:50,440
Yesterday, Ahinsak won.
Today, we'll study the Upanishads.

196
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,810
What form does the
soul take? Ahinsak?

197
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:59,600
You take aim now,
but at the small fruit, alright?

198
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:15,030
- Wonderful.
- Well done, son.

199
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,000
- All my children are very good.
- And Ahinsak?

200
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:22,280
The best. Well done.

201
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:30,300
The race will begin now.
Stand by that door, all of you.

202
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:36,130
Run when I ask you to.
Let's see who comes first.

203
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,810
- Alright, Ahinsak?
- Yes, teacher.

204
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:43,240
Maruti? Dhanpal? Krishna? Alright, go.

205
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,840
Run!

206
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:24,780
Well done, Ahinsak!
Long live, long live.

207
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,930
Well done, Ahinsak, you're the
best at horseriding, too.

208
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,660
These children have grown up.

209
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:38,220
Yes. This is Maruti, this
is Dhanpal, this is Krishna.

210
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:43,360
And this is Ahinsak. This is
Randhir, the deputy commander.

211
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,580
The king sent him to
check on your education.

212
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:52,300
What can the students lack
when you're their teacher?

213
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:57,150
- I'm satisfied with their progress.
- The king specially asked about Ahinsak.

214
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,780
Ahinsak? He's the best at everything.
Weaponry, academics...

215
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,980
and you've seen his horseriding.

216
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,000
Alright, allow me to leave.

217
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:09,940
I have to reach the capital
and prepare for the princess's visit.

218
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:14,400
- She'll be hunting in the forest nearby soon.
- Alright, come.

219
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,890
Did you hear that, Maruti?
Your princess is coming.

220
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,190
- The matter seems delicate to me.
- How?

221
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:32,010
How? This mister Randhir
will praise Ahinsak there.

222
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:39,730
And if the king decides on
Ahinsak instead of Maruti...

223
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,830
- This can't happen.
- Don't be mistaken.

224
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,320
- The king specifically asked about him.
- Yes.

225
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,686
- The king's promised my father.
- But promises...

226
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:52,300
Shut up. The princess is
mine and always will be.

227
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:56,650
- Your life is undisciplined.
- No, mother, it's...

228
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:00,200
Now you'll say that Krishna
messed everything up.

229
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,280
Not just Krishna, others came, too. One
pulled this book, the other pulled that...

230
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,050
- How could I say no?
- You should've.

231
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,960
- Mother.
- What?

232
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,640
You musn't care
so much about me.

233
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,880
Idiot! I don't care that much.

234
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:22,170
- You do.
- So what? Who doesn't care about you?

235
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,460
- Your teacher...
- No, mother. I don't like it.

236
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:29,720
Ahinsak, son, what's
happened to you today?

237
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:32,740
Nothing, mother. Just don't
care so much for me.

238
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,480
Well done, gurumata.
I don't like this behaviour.

239
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,700
Neither do I. Why's she
always going on about Ahinsak?

240
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,250
Why doesn't the teacher mind this?

241
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:57,000
Ahinsak is ahead of us all, but it
doesn't mean she'll only praise him.

242
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:00,770
Forget it, Maruti. I'm not worried
about what's going on in the gurukul.

243
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:04,350
- I'm worried about what'll happen elsewhere.
- Elsewhere?

244
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:09,780
Oh, you idiot, stop
worrying about guruma'ta.

245
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:14,620
- Keep your princess in control.
- She's come, she's come!

246
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,176
- Give me a sweet, Maruti.
- Who's come?

247
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,610
- The one who's yours.
- Mine? Who?

248
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:26,820
- The one. Don't you remember?
- Why don't you tell me?

249
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,420
Your dear princess. She's
hunting in the forest nearby.

250
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:37,870
We know that, but
how is she his princess?

251
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,170
Ahinsak has blocked the path.

252
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,826
Why don't you shut up?
Come, let's meet the princess.

253
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:45,770
Well done! Your teacher
has taught you well.

254
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:49,320
Come, test your arrows.

255
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,890
Who's this coward who
hides and attacks me?

256
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,320
Why don't you come here?

257
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:30,570
Go on, fire another arrow.
This one was yours too.

258
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:34,970
Oh, forgive me. I missed my target.

259
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,300
You miss your aim, and
the arrow hits an innocent.

260
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:43,050
- But it didn't hit you.
- What if it had?

261
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:47,610
- What do you mean?
- You don't know archery.

262
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,420
A woman's soft hands aren't
meant to fire arrows, they're...

263
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,650
Meant to box a man's ears.
Go away.

264
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:08,480
- You didn't obey my order.
- Order? Are you a princess?

265
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,850
Yes. You're standing before
the princess of Shravasti.

266
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:19,120
Princess Maya? You've
grown up so much.

267
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,400
I apologize for my insolence.

268
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:26,720
- I know you.
- But I don't know you.

269
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:30,210
I'm the royal priest's son, Ahinsak.

270
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:38,130
Ahinsak? Now I remember.
You once gave me a garland.

271
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,680
You remember it?

272
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:45,220
Your garland withered, but
its memory is fresh in my mind.

273
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,140
Thank you, but why are you here?

274
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:53,570
I've come to hunt. My tent is
close by. Will you come with me?

275
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,410
- As you wish.
- Come.

276
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,480
- Sit down.
- I? You're the one who's come hunting.

277
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,580
You pulled back your bow
and fired arrows

278
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:23,560
The arrow hit her heart

279
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:28,690
You're now unconscious
of your body and heart

280
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,400
Your soul writhes like a fish

281
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,500
Look, her eyes are nervous

282
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,970
Your heart is restless

283
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,240
How will these nights be spent?

284
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:59,200
Why did you come to
make my heart ill at ease?

285
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:04,200
Would you look at it,
the hunters have come to hunt

286
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:38,430
You've worked so hard
to injure his heart

287
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,130
Your eyes could very
well have done that

288
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,450
Why do you throw
so many tantrums?

289
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,840
Oh, what torture is this?

290
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:03,020
The colors change. Your body dances

291
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,840
This bond will never break

292
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:17,570
Why did you come to
let your eyes meet hers?

293
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:32,660
To attack these innocent deer

294
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,800
- The princess still hasn't returned.
- We've been waiting for ages.

295
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:58,800
God knows what she's hunting.
I've always said that...

296
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:12,090
Wonderful. What animals
the princess has caught!

297
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:28,030
- Oh, so that's why she's late.
- Isn't he a good hunter?

298
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:35,060
Oh, you've come here, too?
Let us have a chance.

299
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,600
Who are these mannerless people?

300
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,260
These are my companions.
Let me introduce you.

301
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,170
This is Maruti, the chief minister's son.

302
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,340
This is Lord Chandrasen's son, Dhanpal.

303
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:57,390
And this is Krishnachandra,
the commander's mannerless son.

304
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:04,580
Father has told me about you.
I was just about to call for you.

305
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:10,360
Thank you for coming.
Please have something.

306
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:14,820
- No, it's very late now.
- Then please come tomorrow.

307
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:26,179
If he's a brave warrior,
then we're cunning, too.

308
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:29,209
Our arrows never miss.

309
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:33,126
You've patted yourself on the back
enough. Tell us what to do.

310
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:38,016
What do you mean? Utter a few words of
love, and victory will be yours.

311
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,160
- Yes!
- The problem is that I can love...

312
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,530
- but I can't pretend to love.
- You can't?

313
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,899
- Then take lessons from me!
- Really, teacher?

314
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:48,969
- Really, teacher?
- Bless you!

315
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:55,340
First, stand before her as if
you're the bravest soldier in the world.

316
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,260
Then, with your eyes
full of love, look at her.

317
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:10,830
You must be smiling, just like this.
Not less, not more.

318
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,880
When she looks at you, say, "Maya!"

319
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:22,930
"You've stolen my peace and my sleep."

320
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:29,490
"Oh, my beautiful thief,
return my peace and sleep to me!"

321
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,940
- Krishna!
- "Return it!"

322
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,640
Say it just like that.

323
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:40,620
Then she'll say, uh,
what will she say?

324
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:46,370
She'll look at you with her large eyes
and her face will turn red.

325
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,360
- As soon as it does, grab the end of her saree.
- Oh!

326
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:59,390
- Then give her your sword. Take it!
- Take it, Maruti.

327
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:06,250
And say,"If you don't have mercy
on me, stab me with this sword!"

328
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,300
- Here.
- She won't stab you, she'll throw it away.

329
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:17,340
- Throw it, Maruti.
- Then she'll say...

330
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:24,280
"Oh, beloved, ever since I've seen you,
my eyes have searched for you."

331
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:29,320
"They search for dreams, and look
for your lovely face in them."

332
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,840
"Don't leave me, don't leave me!"

333
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,010
- Well done, teacher!
- Hail the teacher!

334
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:49,010
- Listen, Maruti.
- What is it, Dhanpal?

335
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:55,040
Ahinsak hasn't come yet.
Tell the princess how you feel.

336
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:59,876
Yes! If Ahinsak comes, your
feelings will remain in your heart.

337
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:03,400
- But you two?
- We'll come. Go.

338
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,100
Tell the princess Maruti has come.

339
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:18,430
Oh! Please come in. Princess?

340
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:26,240
- Hail the princess.
- You? You're very early.

341
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:33,340
Please come. Where are your friends?

342
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:40,900
- Perhaps you mean Ahinsak.
- You have other friends too.

343
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,350
- What do you care for them?
- I don't understand.

344
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:51,960
- Then try to.
- Forget it.

345
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:57,840
I've prepared for your entertainment.
Once your friends are here...

346
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:05,100
- Before that, I'd like to say something.
- Please go ahead.

347
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,880
- In private.
- Oh, is it important?

348
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:15,540
- Yes.
- Basanti?

349
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:27,540
- I wanted to say...
- Yes, go ahead.

350
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:34,170
- The way you're with Ahinsak all the time...
- That's all you wanted to say?

351
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:39,480
- That's not a big deal.
- It is for me.

352
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:45,310
- Are you aware I'm the chief minister's son?
- I am.

353
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:49,730
- Did you know you're betrothed to me?
- I did not.

354
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:56,190
- You know it now. It's what the king wants.
- Perhaps you do, too.

355
00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:01,130
- But do you know what I want?
- I do.

356
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:10,240
- You and Ahinsak are very different.
- It's my job to think of that.

357
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:16,120
Who I meet and who
I don't is my business, too.

358
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:20,260
- I don't need your advice.
- You're insulting me, princess.

359
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,820
Oh, you've come!

360
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:33,040
- You took so long. Come in.
- Oh, Maruti.

361
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:37,060
- Where are you off to? Have a seat.
- My friends and I will come in a while.

362
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:38,910
Come.

363
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,070
- Did something happen?
- No, but it will now.

364
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,000
Well done!

365
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,770
Princess! The tiger
has left its cage.

366
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,240
Princess! Don't go outside.

367
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,300
- Princess!
- Ahinsak!

368
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,600
Stop him, Basanti.

369
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,730
Let go of me, Basanti.

370
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,410
Thank you!

371
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,440
What have you done?
What if you'd missed your aim?

372
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:00,100
Come in. Basanti. Prepare the medicine.

373
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:06,200
Allow me to leave, princess.
I must return to the gurukul now.

374
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:10,590
- No, I won't let you.
- But the wound isn't very deep, princess.

375
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:17,280
- I should go. My friends have already left.
- Friends? They're cowards.

376
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,900
They let you risk your
life and ran away.

377
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:23,056
- Come in, you must rest here.
- But...

378
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,010
Come. Mangala?

379
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,820
- Greetings, teacher.
- Where's Ahinsak?

380
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:37,210
- In the princess's camp.
- In her camp?

381
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:43,240
It's past dusk.
He should've returned by now.

382
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:49,096
- He'll spend the night there.
- How can this be? The gurukul's rules...

383
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:54,430
We tried to tell him, teacher,
but he said rules are for fools.

384
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:02,010
He fought with me about this
and ended up injured.

385
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:09,040
- He's become quite mean, teacher.
- Send him to me when he returns.

386
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:11,160
What will the teacher think?

387
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:17,170
I can't speak for your teacher, but
the princess is definitely lost in thought.

388
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:23,410
- I? What am I thinking of?
- How should I know?

389
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:31,160
Oh, yes, I was thinking of
how you risked your life for me.

390
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,450
- How can I ever repay you?
- Repay?

391
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:41,200
Don't worry, our princess
has already repaid you.

392
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,260
- How?
- By injuring herself with you.

393
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,980
Injured? Where?

394
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:59,000
Some wounds cannot be seen,
princess, and they hurt a lot.

395
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,420
What nonsense! Go away!

396
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,910
- I've wanted to leave for a while.
- Idiot!

397
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:08,770
- Thank you, Mangala.
- For what? Leaving?

398
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,080
Again?

399
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,210
She says such inappropriate things.

400
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:19,500
But there are things
you can't say yourself.

401
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,880
And there are things
that shouldn't be said.

402
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:30,100
- Keep quiet and get some rest.
- Rest? There's none for me.

403
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:38,580
- You aren't sleepy?
- How can I be, with the moon before me?

404
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:44,300
The moon? But the moon
is outside, in the sky.

405
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:50,130
Yours must be. Mine is right
here, on the earth.

406
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:53,770
You won't stop talking?
Alright, I will.

407
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:00,220
But your eyes have spoken,
and I understand their language.

408
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:14,410
Alright, get some rest.
It's late at night.

409
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:23,680
I hope this night never ends,
and the moon never sets.

410
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:05,870
Set slowly, oh moon

411
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:39,220
This quiet night won't return tomorrow

412
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:39,520
The incomplete dreams of my
childhood are coming true today

413
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:59,770
I don't know when these
golden moments will return

414
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:55,840
The bride of love has dressed up,
clarinets play in my heart

415
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:15,500
Today, I will use the night
as kohl to streak my eyes

416
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:51,710
We'll meet in Shravasti now.

417
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:55,730
We'll come to Shravasti
in a few days.

418
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:01,440
And I'm returning today. You must come
to Shravasti on the next full moon.

419
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:05,220
- Why?
- It's my birthday.

420
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:12,590
You once gifted me a garland.
That's why I came here.

421
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,280
We've met again after
so long. Won't you come?

422
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:23,350
No, princess. Leaving
the gurukul like this...

423
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:31,900
- No, you must fulfill my wish.
- It's my wish, too, but...

424
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:37,580
No buts. You must come.

425
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:43,700
It's very hard to refuse you.
Alright, allow me to leave.

426
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:46,270
Come.

427
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:55,200
- You asked for me, teacher?
- Where did you spend the night?

428
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:59,420
I was injured, teacher.
I couldn't return.

429
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:05,650
- You've broken the gurukul's rule.
- Forgive me, teacher.

430
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:13,800
You've broken the gurukul's rule today.
You'll break society's rules tomorrow.

431
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:23,770
- It appears the prediction was true.
- Prediction? What are you saying?

432
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:32,180
- Ahrinsak, leave before I get angry.
- Teacher!

433
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:55,860
The princess was right in asking you
to stay, but you weren't right in staying.

434
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:02,120
The gurukul has rules, discipline. You'll
be more careful in the future, won't you?

435
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,180
I will.

436
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:20,520
Who moves in your heart,
in your eyes, in your life?

437
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:25,580
Who speaks in your soul,
in your dreams, in your breath?

438
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:42,060
Go away, I won't tell you
the name of my beloved

439
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:54,960
This is the secret love of
the moon and the partridge

440
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:23,330
Dark clouds live in his curly hair,
the moon fawns over his face

441
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:37,680
When I look at his blue eyes
and bow-like brows, I nearly die

442
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:50,210
Who is the trickster, the troublemaker,
who adds color to your life?

443
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:20,330
Studs in his ears, a bow on his
shoulder, a red line on his forehead

444
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:34,260
The one my eyes have fallen in love
with is one among a million

445
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:46,580
Who is the beloved who lives
in your heart and removes your veil?

446
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:21,770
What are you staring
at? Go away!

447
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:27,260
I'll leave too, princess.
Will you allow me?

448
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:37,890
You took so long.
I've been waiting.

449
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,260
It takes time to get
here from the gurukul.

450
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:43,390
- And...
- And?

451
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:51,410
It's thorny, too. I walked on those
thorns and got you this garland.

452
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:58,850
- This is your birthday gift.
- There's someone I like more than these flowers.

453
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,200
- Who is it?
- Someone.

454
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:15,870
- Tell me, who is it? Tell me.
- This one.

455
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,690
What have you done, princess?

456
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:35,950
You once put a garland around my neck.
I've done the same to you today.

457
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:40,780
- But we're not children now, princess.
- I know that, too.

458
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:49,300
And do you know what it means
when a woman garlands a man?

459
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:55,060
- Tell me.
- How can I?

460
00:56:56,270 --> 00:57:03,130
Don't address me so formally.
Our language has informal words, too.

461
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:07,240
Princess, it would mean something else.

462
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:13,950
It only means what
I ask of you now.

463
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:23,180
- What?
- Love. I only want your love. May I have it?

464
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:27,840
What can I give someone whose
name hits me like lightning...

465
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,580
whose voice always
echoes in my ears...

466
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:43,810
whose face is a moon when I'm awake
and a dream when I sleep?

467
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:51,940
- All I think of is the storm that...
- We'll turn the storms into shores, Ahinsak.

468
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:55,270
If our love is true.

469
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:00,330
- Maya...
- Ahinsak...

470
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:10,510
Ahinsak?

471
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:22,040
- He still hasn't returned.
- Who, Ahinsak?

472
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:26,420
He must've gone to disgrace us.

473
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:32,530
- But why are you here so late at night?
- I've worried about him all evening.

474
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:37,950
I couldn't fall asleep, so
I thought I'd see if he's returned.

475
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:46,160
- Look, here he is.
- Teacher. Gurumata.

476
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,060
Where were you?

477
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:57,810
Nobody knew your whereabouts.
Do you know how late it is?

478
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:02,740
- Tell me, where did you go?
- To meet someone.

479
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:06,220
- Who?
- Forgive me, teacher.

480
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:08,910
They don't want me to tell anyone.

481
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:14,010
Ahinsak! It appears the
prediction will come true.

482
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:18,250
- A prediction? About me?
- Yes.

483
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,390
You can't enter the gurukul today. It's
the second time you've broken its rules.

484
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:27,400
I didn't punish you last time,
but I can't forgive you again.

485
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:31,730
You'll have to sleep outside today,
under the open sky.

486
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,560
As you wish, teacher.

487
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:43,850
No. You'll sleep without those.
Nothing to lie on, nothing to drape.

488
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:47,150
As you wish.

489
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:56,200
What is this cruel wish?
Outside, on this cold winter night.

490
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:02,660
- Nothing to lie on, nothing to drape...
- Keep quiet. The gurukul has rules, discipline.

491
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:05,260
Go away.

492
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:29,490
- Maruti!
- Teacher? I'm coming.

493
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:41,070
Ahinsak has just returned.
Do you know where he went?

494
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:43,530
- Yes, we all know.
- Where did he go?

495
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:47,690
- To the princess.
- Why didn't you tell me?

496
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:52,920
There's a lot I've wanted to say,
but I couldn't find the courage.

497
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:55,310
- Is there more?
- Yes, there is.

498
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:57,840
What?

499
01:00:58,110 --> 01:01:04,010
Promise me you won't get mad
when I tell you, and you'll look into it.

500
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:08,480
I promise. Speak. What is it?

501
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:18,110
- Gurumata is very gracious to Ahinsak.
- I know, but so what?

502
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:23,970
- This graciousness is frowned upon.
- Do you know what you're saying?

503
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:26,420
That's why I didn't speak up.

504
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,070
- Well done, Maruti, well done.
- You've won.

505
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:44,580
I've poisoned the teacher's thoughts.

506
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:47,140
The arrow has hit its target.

507
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:49,170
Now Ahinsak is...

508
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:25,570
- Gurumata is very gracious to Ahinsak.
- I know, but so what?

509
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:31,580
- This graciousness is frowned upon.
- Do you know what you're saying?

510
01:02:58,010 --> 01:03:00,520
Why are you laughing?
Come to the arena.

511
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:04,990
- I'll defeat you, too.
- No, you play. I'm unwell.

512
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:08,840
Why not just say you
don't dare to face Maruti?

513
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:10,920
Coward.

514
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:17,480
I've learned swordfighting,
but I don't believe in it.

515
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:22,650
- Then?
- I believe in the power of peace and love.

516
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:26,240
- In the power of the princess's love?
- Maruti!

517
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:31,120
Oh?

518
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,610
This is your chance, Maruti!

519
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:19,180
Help, help! Teacher!

520
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:24,700
He's killed Maruti! Is anyone here?

521
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:27,550
- Teacher!
- What is it?

522
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:36,330
- Ahinsak tried to kill Maruti.
- No, teacher. They tried to kill me.

523
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,120
They called me cowardly
and challenged me.

524
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:44,930
Aren't you ashamed of lying? Krishna
did jokingly take the princess's name.

525
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:50,750
- He attacked him with his sword.
- And when Maruti tried to save me...

526
01:05:50,810 --> 01:05:53,420
Quiet! I've understood
everything, Krishna.

527
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:56,780
This is what he's meant to do.
It's in his horoscope.

528
01:05:56,830 --> 01:06:01,650
Teacher, you often speak of my horoscope.
What's written in my horoscope?

529
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:06,026
What's written in it is coming
true. Cruel, lowly murderer!

530
01:06:06,050 --> 01:06:08,660
- Teacher!
- It's two days until gurudakshina.

531
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,640
At least let them pass, Murderer!

532
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,430
- Get out of my sight!
- Teacher!

533
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:34,600
Why's Ahinsak crying?
What did you tell the child?

534
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:37,610
Child? Aren't you ashamed
of calling him that?

535
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:42,110
What are you saying?
What's happened to you?

536
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,890
- You're asking me?
- Who else should I ask?

537
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,600
Ask your heart. Ask that murderer!

538
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:55,500
- Murderer? Who?
- Your darling Ahinsak!

539
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:59,800
Ahinsak, a murderer?
What has he done?

540
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:04,860
What hasn't he done?
He doesn't care for the gurukul's rules.

541
01:07:06,510 --> 01:07:11,870
He attacked Maruti.
He's entrapped the princess.

542
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:19,730
He... Get out of my sight!

543
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:25,380
Here. It's time to
leave the gurukul.

544
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:28,200
- But Ahinsak?
- He's ill.

545
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:31,230
- Gurumata must've told him to be.
- Why's that?

546
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,210
So he can stay back.

547
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:37,540
So he won't give gurudakshina
at the dikshant ceremony?

548
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:40,420
God save us from such sinners,
such cruel men, such...

549
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,190
Forget it. What's it to us?

550
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:46,010
- As he sows...
- So shall he reap!

551
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:51,090
- Ahinsak, how are you now, son?
- Alright, mother.

552
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:54,990
Oh! You're feverish. Where
are you going like this?

553
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,300
The dikshant ceremony is today.
I have to give gurudakshina.

554
01:07:59,090 --> 01:08:02,070
I have to return to Shravasti
with your and the teacher's blessings.

555
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:05,080
No, you can't go to
Shravasti like this.

556
01:08:05,410 --> 01:08:08,520
- But all my friends are going.
- You can go later.

557
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,720
I won't let you go today.
Go to sleep.

558
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:14,370
Such high fever.

559
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:22,730
Ahinsak, you won't forget me
when you're in Shravasti, will you?

560
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:27,369
How can anyone forget such love?

561
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:31,230
- You'll visit sometimes, won't you?
- Yes, I surely will.

562
01:08:32,490 --> 01:08:36,360
When you're gone, I'll be
so lonely in the gurukul.

563
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:43,320
- I'll keep visiting.
- Alright, I'll bring you warm milk.

564
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:04,140
- Ahinsak!
- Teacher?

565
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,590
- Leave the gurukul right away!
- Teacher!

566
01:09:06,979 --> 01:09:10,929
- Leave!
- Why, teacher?

567
01:09:11,149 --> 01:09:15,329
Why? As if you don't
know! Leave!

568
01:09:15,490 --> 01:09:17,370
But what's my crime?

569
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:21,769
Crime? It's my crime, not yours,
that I couldn't mend your ways.

570
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:26,720
But my gurudakshina?

571
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:32,850
Gurudakshina? What gurudakshina
will a lowly murderer give me?

572
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:38,489
Go, murder innocent people!
Ruin society's peace!

573
01:09:38,939 --> 01:09:43,899
Take away married women's... Oh!
Perhaps this was your gurudakshina!

574
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:49,439
- Leave!
- Teacher, my knowledge will be incomplete without gurudakshina.

575
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:52,540
Punish me if I've committed
a crime. Teacher!

576
01:09:57,070 --> 01:10:05,020
- I don't understand. What have I done?
- What an innocent child you are!

577
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:08,900
Dhanpal! You know the reason
for the teacher's anger.

578
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:14,770
Yes, I know it. You've
betrayed the people who loved you.

579
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:19,390
- What?
- The king graciously sent you here to study...

580
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:22,200
- and you entrapped his daughter.
- Dhanpal!

581
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:26,850
The teacher raised you with care
and you cast your evil eye on his wife.

582
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:27,990
Dhanpal!

583
01:10:28,270 --> 01:10:32,920
- How dare you?
- Such words for gurumata, who is as pure as the Ganges?

584
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,030
For a woman who
is like my mother?

585
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:40,080
- How dare you?
- Take back your words.

586
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,960
- Take back your words!
- No!

587
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:07,760
What can a lowly murderer
like you give me?

588
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:12,380
Go, murder innocent people!
Ruin society's peace!

589
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:16,850
Take away married women's... Oh!
Perhaps this was your gurudakshina!

590
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:25,020
- Leave!
- Dhanpal! Dhanpal, Ahinsak?

591
01:11:30,670 --> 01:11:38,430
Dhanpal? Dhanpal! Murder! Teacher!

592
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:44,000
- Ahinsak murdered Dhanpal!
- What happened?

593
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:47,676
- Gurumata, Ahinsak killed Dhanpal!
- Where's he?

594
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:52,690
He ran away. Gurumata!

595
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:04,650
Inform the king that Ahinsak
has committed a murder and run away!

596
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:07,120
The prediction has come true!

597
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:11,850
- What are you saying?
- I swear, my lord, it's true.

598
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,280
Ahinsak has crossed the gurukul's limits.

599
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:20,300
- He has murdered Dhanpal!
- No, this cannot be.

600
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:25,790
This cannot be, my lord.
There must be some mistake.

601
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:32,770
There's no mistake.
The horoscope was right.

602
01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:35,130
- Commander.
- Yes, my lord?

603
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:41,100
Send soldiers after Ahinsak.
Guard every door in town.

604
01:12:42,010 --> 01:12:47,730
Warn the people that anyone who
attempts to aid the criminal will die.

605
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:53,710
Destiny works in strange ways.

606
01:12:54,030 --> 01:12:56,990
- It's a disaster, princess, a disaster!
- What happened?

607
01:12:57,330 --> 01:13:02,200
- Ahinsak murdered Dhanpal in the gurukul!
- What are you saying?

608
01:13:04,010 --> 01:13:12,010
- I've heard, I've heard that
Ahinsak, Ahinsak and the gurumata...

609
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:18,480
I'm telling the truth, princess.
Maruti has just brought the news...

610
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:24,880
that Ahinsak has run away, and
soldiers have been sent after him.

611
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:36,720
What am I hearing?
What has happened?

612
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:44,130
God, today is such a good day.

613
01:13:44,990 --> 01:13:48,970
My Ahinsak, having completed his
education, will return home today.

614
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:55,810
It's such a good day.
Perhaps he's come!

615
01:13:56,910 --> 01:13:58,010
Coming!

616
01:14:12,910 --> 01:14:20,360
- Where's Ahinsak? Where's my Ahinsak?
- Forget your Ahinsak now. Throw this away!

617
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:30,320
Extinguish these lamps! All the
light has left our lives now.

618
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:36,960
- What are you saying? Has Ahinsak...
- He's turned violent.

619
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:40,910
He's murdered Dhanpal and
run away from the gurukul.

620
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:45,330
The king has sent
soldiers after him.

621
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:53,440
- No, this can't be. This can't happen.
- It's happened. All our attempts were in vain.

622
01:14:57,510 --> 01:15:03,920
The astrologer's inauspicious words
were true. Do you remember what he said?

623
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:07,200
His hands will slice many necks.

624
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:14,980
He brought storm and
destruction when he was born...

625
01:15:15,570 --> 01:15:23,570
And it will always follow him. Every place
he passes through will be destroyed.

626
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:38,590
He will thirst for human blood.

627
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:00,860
Mother Ganges, you are
the saviour of the world.

628
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:05,700
Wait for me. I have no one.

629
01:16:06,190 --> 01:16:11,230
Wherever I go, people will
accuse me, blame me.

630
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:17,170
Give me refuge today, Mother.
Hide me in your waves. I'm coming!

631
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:39,890
When the days of sorrow come.
When lies win over truth

632
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:56,930
When the clouds of infamy
gather over an innocent heart

633
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:07,330
When the winds of injustice
hurt your ears

634
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:11,600
Then, oh human, you must chant

635
01:17:11,890 --> 01:17:15,950
I take refuge in Buddha

636
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:31,980
I take refuge in Dhamma

637
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:35,920
I take refuge in Sangha

638
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:51,520
[Buddhist chant]

639
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:10,260
What a heavenly tone. Are you a
gandharv, a transgender, or a god?

640
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:19,800
No, worshipper. I am only
a humble follower of the master.

641
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:23,500
- Why are you here?
- For your wellbeing.

642
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:31,640
My wellbeing lies in ending my life.
I cannot handle any more false accusations.

643
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:41,660
Worshipper, you move from
one darkness to another.

644
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:48,580
It is a sin in itself
to give yourself to death.

645
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:54,920
Worshipper, you can move
from this path to one of goodness.

646
01:18:56,730 --> 01:19:04,730
What goodness can one whose
life is caught in storms have?

647
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:12,650
Goodness is meant for those
who have been injured by sorrow.

648
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:21,460
Forgive me, but my sorrows
cannot be soothed by your consolations.

649
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:30,200
Those who dwell in oblivion
have no sorrows the lord cannot cure.

650
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:40,640
Then tell me, how can
I erase my sorrows?

651
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:45,170
You will have to walk
on the path of Sangha.

652
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:49,570
Then I will do so.
I will take refuge in him.

653
01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:58,490
- Where will Lord Buddha be now?
- He will be in his ashram.

654
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:04,860
- Then bless me.
- Live well, worshipper.

655
01:20:06,030 --> 01:20:14,030
[Buddhist chant]

656
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:37,690
- Who is it?
- Your son, Ahinsak.

657
01:20:38,590 --> 01:20:41,980
- I have no son.
- Father, I'm innocent.

658
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:48,060
- I know that.
- Listen to me, father.

659
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:53,440
I don't want to. I heard what the
astrologer said when you were born.

660
01:20:54,410 --> 01:20:57,870
It was my mistake that
I didn't kill you right then.

661
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:02,480
I'm innocent, father.
I didn't want to kill Dhanpal.

662
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:06,180
When he falsely accused me,
I opposed him...

663
01:21:06,830 --> 01:21:12,080
and when he tried to kill me,
he died at my hands.

664
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:16,080
Many more will die at
your hands. I know it.

665
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:20,570
Don't darken my doorstep
with your shadow. Go away!

666
01:21:21,170 --> 01:21:28,850
Father, let me meet my mother
once. Let me take her blessing.

667
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:35,160
I know a mother will
never turn away her son.

668
01:21:36,110 --> 01:21:38,600
She doesn't want to
look at you. Go away!

669
01:21:39,230 --> 01:21:44,240
Father, don't turn me away.
Please listen to me.

670
01:21:44,570 --> 01:21:48,290
Please open the door!

671
01:21:54,370 --> 01:22:00,030
Even my parents have
turned against me.

672
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:11,000
I have no one. I
have no one in this world.

673
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,970
What was that noise?
Who were you talking to?

674
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:36,620
- Tell me, who had come?
- No one.

675
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:41,140
- How come? Tell me.
- Ahinsak.

676
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:47,340
Ahinsak? My Ahinsak came?
Where did he go?

677
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:50,190
Who knows?

678
01:22:51,610 --> 01:22:54,460
What are you saying?
Why did you let him go?

679
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:56,380
Should I have invited him in?

680
01:22:56,850 --> 01:23:00,720
He didn't see his gurumata as a mother.
He murdered his own brother.

681
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:02,860
- He's your son.
- My son is dead!

682
01:23:06,030 --> 01:23:08,400
You're saying this? You?

683
01:23:16,170 --> 01:23:19,490
Oh, Ahinsak.

684
01:23:30,930 --> 01:23:32,800
Hail the goddess!

685
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:38,370
Do you see what humans do?
They thirst for innocent blood.

686
01:24:39,210 --> 01:24:42,170
Humans are monsters.

687
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:50,320
All these people have
been troubled by Ahinsak.

688
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:57,160
He murders people, wears their
fingers in a garland, and roams free.

689
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:02,220
- Angulimala (finger garland)?
- Yes, that's what they call him now.

690
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:09,680
My lord, based on what they say,
he is now a demon, not a human being.

691
01:25:10,590 --> 01:25:17,050
- They say he's been possessed.
- Maruti, leave with a battalion.

692
01:25:17,730 --> 01:25:19,590
Bring him to me, dead or alive.

693
01:25:20,050 --> 01:25:26,140
As you say, my lord. But how did
so much power fit in such a small body?

694
01:25:26,970 --> 01:25:28,370
I don't understand it.

695
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:34,520
What if he's really possessed, and
he slices the battalion like vegetables?

696
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:41,250
Maruti! I made you commander because
I thought you were brave and intelligent.

697
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:49,400
But I see that I was wrong.
My arms are still strong.

698
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:53,760
I can slay that monster myself.
Prepare my horse.

699
01:25:54,220 --> 01:26:02,050
- Father, I'll go, not you.
- Where? After Angulimala?

700
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:07,840
- Yes, father.
- Have you gone mad?

701
01:26:08,590 --> 01:26:13,230
You'll go after a
murderer Maruti fears?

702
01:26:13,390 --> 01:26:18,160
Father, arms and armies
cannot capture him.

703
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:26,020
- What can?
- Sympathy, love, and respect.

704
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:32,780
- Maya!
- Father, I'm sure he can change.

705
01:26:34,270 --> 01:26:38,036
Our rejection has
made him what he is. If...

706
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:43,090
If we fall to his feet and
beg him, he'll forgive us.

707
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,020
I'm not talking about
politics or justice.

708
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:51,680
Although, if you think about it,
we're the criminals, not him.

709
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:57,040
We blocked his path and
forced him into a life of crime.

710
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:00,560
Who blocked his path?
Who forced him?

711
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:05,600
Princess, by siding with the criminal,
you're encouraging him to commit crimes.

712
01:27:06,530 --> 01:27:10,400
I'm not talking to you,
and you cannot understand me.

713
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:17,900
- Nobody sees their own faults.
- My lord, she's insulting our politics and justice.

714
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:24,750
I'll leave with the batallion today
and bring him to you, dead or alive.

715
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:26,160
Well done, Maruti!

716
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:41,020
Father, stop him! It will be
a disaster, father. Stop him.

717
01:28:33,530 --> 01:28:38,096
- There's no sign of the monster.
- Commander, we're tired. Let's rest here.

718
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:43,780
No! They say he lives around here.
Where could that monster be?

719
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:55,580
- Who is it?
- Angulimala, you're finished!

720
01:29:56,110 --> 01:29:57,510
Where did he go?

721
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:05,690
He must be close by.
Light the torch!

722
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:11,140
Spread out. You, come with me.

723
01:30:57,530 --> 01:31:00,000
Why do you hide and attack?
Why don't you come here?

724
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:27,900
Search for him!

725
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:46,240
He hides and attacks.
Why don't you come here?

726
01:31:47,690 --> 01:31:55,290
You don't dare to face Maruti.
Coward. Come here and I'll show you!

727
01:31:55,980 --> 01:31:58,560
Why don't you come out?
Why don't you face me?

728
01:31:59,630 --> 01:32:01,480
I'm facing you, Maruti.

729
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:13,440
- Ahinsak...
- Ahinsak! Call me Angulimala.

730
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:18,290
This isn't the gurukul, Maruti!

731
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:39,720
- Brother, you're my brother, aren't you?
- Brother?

732
01:33:45,330 --> 01:33:53,330
- Princess? Princess!
- Maruti? What happened to you?

733
01:33:57,580 --> 01:34:03,650
- That monster did this. Angulimala.
- Didn't you bring a battallion?

734
01:34:06,650 --> 01:34:08,350
I did. Don't laugh at me, princess.

735
01:34:08,990 --> 01:34:11,400
It's your fate and
God's mercy that I'm alive.

736
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:18,990
- Come, let's return to the capital.
- Coward. Out of my way. Let me go.

737
01:34:19,450 --> 01:34:23,560
- Where? Where will you go?
- To Ahinsak.

738
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:29,040
- So you still love him?
- Love is everlasting, Maruti.

739
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:33,320
- Out of my way!
- No! You can't leave me and go to him.

740
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:42,600
I love you with all my life.
I've got you now, and I won't let go.

741
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:45,400
- Out of my way!
- No!

742
01:34:46,570 --> 01:34:48,300
- Let go of me!
- No!

743
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:54,330
- He's violent. He'll kill you.
- But I won't run like a coward as you did.

744
01:34:55,130 --> 01:34:56,230
Maya!

745
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:04,960
- Let go of me.
- No. You can't go.

746
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:09,580
You can't escape from me now.

747
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:56,110
- Who, Maruti?
- Teacher, forgive me.

748
01:35:57,330 --> 01:36:01,690
- What happened to you?
- Where's Maya? Where's Ahinsak?

749
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:10,010
- So that sinner did this to you.
- No, teacher. I'm the sinner, not Ahinsak.

750
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:18,360
- Forgive me, Ahinsak. Forgive me, teacher.
- Forgive? What's the matter, Maruti?

751
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:26,300
I made you hate Ahinsak
because I was jealous.

752
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:32,530
Gurumata was pure as the
Ganges, but I stigmatized her.

753
01:36:34,140 --> 01:36:40,340
I'm the cause of Ahinsak's sins.
He's innocent. Gurumata is innocent.

754
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:47,260
Forgive me, teacher. I have
paid for my sins. Forgive me.

755
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:53,420
Maruti!

756
01:36:56,930 --> 01:37:01,150
Ahinsak!

757
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:16,140
- Who is it?
- I? I'm Maya.

758
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:27,200
- Who's Maya?
- You don't recognize me, Ahinsak?

759
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:29,780
Ahinsak? Who's Ahinsak?

760
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:35,920
Ahinsak is dead. The
princess killed him that night.

761
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:42,450
- Don't say that!
- Don't touch me, human.

762
01:37:42,750 --> 01:37:50,750
- You're human, too.
- I? I'm not human.

763
01:37:54,940 --> 01:37:59,900
I'm Angulimala, man's death. Go away.

764
01:38:00,450 --> 01:38:07,880
- No. I've come to make you human.
- Human? I'll become human?

765
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:11,310
The human inside me is dead.

766
01:38:12,050 --> 01:38:16,800
But love has the power
to revive the dead.

767
01:38:17,060 --> 01:38:19,890
Love? What love?

768
01:38:20,830 --> 01:38:24,860
You said that night that there
is no love or trust in the world.

769
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:27,360
Where did this love
suddenly come from?

770
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:30,410
Love was always there.
Love is everlasting.

771
01:38:31,180 --> 01:38:39,180
Ahinsak, let's return to the world
where humans love each other.

772
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:43,080
Where humans hate each other
and falsely accuse them.

773
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:45,300
Where they play with blood.

774
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:51,480
You want me to return to a world
with no justice, truth or trust?

775
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:58,260
- Have you gone mad?
- You have. You play with people's blood.

776
01:38:58,980 --> 01:39:05,450
Ahinsak, is this your truth?
Is killing innocents your justice?

777
01:39:06,010 --> 01:39:13,460
Nobody is innocent. And who
turned me violent? You did!

778
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:21,540
Forgive me. I was
mistaken that day.

779
01:39:23,230 --> 01:39:26,430
I believed what people said
and spoke innappropriately.

780
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:33,630
I never thought what
the result would be.

781
01:39:35,310 --> 01:39:42,830
I regret it. Ahinsak, I
know you can't be heartless.

782
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:48,810
- Maya, I'm bad. Go away.
- I won't leave without you.

783
01:39:49,420 --> 01:39:52,880
- Go away, I say!
- No, I won't.

784
01:39:54,480 --> 01:40:02,210
I might attack you. My eyes
turn red when I see humans.

785
01:40:02,510 --> 01:40:03,910
Then kill me, too.

786
01:40:04,090 --> 01:40:08,670
Leave before Angulimala is
accused of murdering a woman.

787
01:40:09,830 --> 01:40:13,070
Leave? How can I leave
when I've found my destination?

788
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:17,230
I'll take you with me or
die at your hands.

789
01:40:17,890 --> 01:40:21,690
The eyes that see you
like this should be closed forever.

790
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:23,950
- Leave!
- No, no, no!

791
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:33,690
Ahinsak...

792
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:40,360
Where am I?

793
01:41:45,940 --> 01:41:49,930
Ahinsak! Ahinsak?

794
01:42:34,490 --> 01:42:36,760
Save us from Angulimala, king!

795
01:42:48,660 --> 01:42:53,240
- We want to meet the king!
- We want Angulimala's blood!

796
01:42:57,240 --> 01:43:00,760
- Give us justice, king!
- Save us from Angulimala, king!

797
01:43:00,810 --> 01:43:02,110
Have mercy, lord!

798
01:43:02,410 --> 01:43:05,800
Please calm down. I've got the news.

799
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:09,440
Angulimala's time is up.

800
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:14,580
I'll leave with a battalion today
and kill that monster.

801
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:16,570
Hail the king!

802
01:43:59,050 --> 01:44:03,620
Forgive me, I can't wait any longer.

803
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:12,900
I want to see my son.
God, protect my Ahinsak.

804
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:29,480
Who should I call for
when my listener won't listen to me?

805
01:44:41,020 --> 01:44:49,020
This heartless world has
never understood love

806
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:08,300
When heartlessness overpowers mercy...

807
01:45:08,640 --> 01:45:16,640
when the inferior human
forgets his lord...

808
01:45:18,740 --> 01:45:26,566
when truth fears and faith stumbles...

809
01:45:26,590 --> 01:45:30,540
then, oh human, you must chant...

810
01:45:30,590 --> 01:45:34,510
I take refuge in Buddha

811
01:45:45,860 --> 01:45:49,856
I take refuge in Dhamma

812
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:54,090
I take refuge in Sangha

813
01:46:01,340 --> 01:46:05,130
I take refuge in Buddha.

814
01:46:45,390 --> 01:46:53,390
- Princess! Maya! You?
- Gurumata.

815
01:47:01,110 --> 01:47:07,770
Forgive me, Gurumata.
I thought badly of you.

816
01:47:08,330 --> 01:47:15,470
This is of no use now, princess.
By God's grace, my dishonor has gone.

817
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:19,320
- The world knows what the truth is.
- Really?

818
01:47:19,890 --> 01:47:23,660
Yes, princess. The news
has come from Shravasti.

819
01:47:24,090 --> 01:47:27,760
- Then the gurukul...
- No, Maya.

820
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:32,580
I will serve the lord
all my life now.

821
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:37,710
The merciful Lord Buddha will
soon take me under his wing.

822
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:43,680
But Maya, how are you
here in this condition?

823
01:47:44,580 --> 01:47:52,580
Gurumata, I've left my royal life
to beg Lord Buddha for mercy.

824
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:01,790
Not for myself, but for Ahinsak.

825
01:48:03,890 --> 01:48:08,030
Only Lord Buddha's pure
love can save him.

826
01:48:09,740 --> 01:48:14,730
A ray of his mercy
will reform him.

827
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:19,420
I'll wash the lord's
feet with my tears...

828
01:48:20,980 --> 01:48:28,050
And pray to him to
save my Ahinsak.

829
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:31,550
Reform Angulimala.

830
01:48:32,250 --> 01:48:34,400
Maya, you're tired.

831
01:48:34,820 --> 01:48:38,500
Rest for a bit, then
we'll visit Lord Buddha.

832
01:48:38,900 --> 01:48:40,100
- Alright.
- Come.

833
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:44,620
Who is it? A human?
Thirsting for my blood?

834
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:08,160
My garland has 999 fingers.
This kill will make it 1000.

835
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:14,320
The royal astrologer's
prediction will come true.

836
01:50:16,460 --> 01:50:20,590
Your blessings will come true, teacher.

837
01:51:04,810 --> 01:51:12,810
I take refuge in Buddha

838
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:23,810
When all love leaves the world...

839
01:51:33,950 --> 01:51:37,540
when the walls of hatred rise...

840
01:51:37,850 --> 01:51:45,340
when a mother's love is
returned by her son's sword...

841
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:57,226
when the earth quakes
and the sky trembles...

842
01:51:57,250 --> 01:52:01,010
then, oh human,
you must chant...

843
01:52:01,100 --> 01:52:04,780
I take refuge in Buddha

844
01:52:16,850 --> 01:52:20,650
I take refuge in Dhamma

845
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:24,110
I take refuge in Sangha

846
01:52:49,710 --> 01:52:55,620
What is this magic?
Who are you? Come here!

847
01:52:58,490 --> 01:53:06,490
[Buddhist chant]

848
01:53:19,330 --> 01:53:27,330
So you're the magician.
Wait, I'll kill you first.

849
01:53:37,690 --> 01:53:40,110
Stop! Why are you
running? Stay still!

850
01:53:40,650 --> 01:53:44,440
I'm still. You're not.
You're running.

851
01:53:45,140 --> 01:53:49,930
I'm running? The world runs
from me, and so do you.

852
01:53:50,610 --> 01:53:58,610
No. Those who know religion,
love, peace and mercy fear no one.

853
01:53:59,850 --> 01:54:07,850
I don't believe in religion,
love, peace and mercy.

854
01:54:11,580 --> 01:54:19,580
To allow insects to live and protect
animals, you must have mercy and love.

855
01:54:20,670 --> 01:54:25,230
You're the first to say this.
Everyone else hates me.

856
01:54:25,580 --> 01:54:30,890
- Everyone thirsted for my blood.
- Is that why you're violent?

857
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:36,810
Why shouldn't I? I'll avenge
everything they've done to me.

858
01:54:37,690 --> 01:54:42,020
The fire in my heart will cool down
only when I've eradicated humans.

859
01:54:42,850 --> 01:54:50,850
Fire is cooled with water, not more fire.
Love cancels out hatred, not more hatred.

860
01:54:52,540 --> 01:55:00,540
[Buddhist chant]

861
01:55:01,870 --> 01:55:07,780
Always remember that humans can be
won over with love, not with weapons.

862
01:55:08,460 --> 01:55:13,650
- I don't understand your empty words.
- I'll explain them.

863
01:55:14,420 --> 01:55:22,420
- Take a leaf from the twig.
- Now what?

864
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:34,780
Now put it back.

865
01:55:43,900 --> 01:55:45,100
It's impossible.

866
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:50,980
It is injustice to kill
what you cannot revive.

867
01:55:51,890 --> 01:55:55,690
Think, how many mothers
have you made childless?

868
01:55:56,360 --> 01:55:57,960
How many infants have you orphaned?

869
01:55:58,910 --> 01:56:00,660
How many women have you widowed?

870
01:56:01,450 --> 01:56:03,250
How many old people
have you made helpless?

871
01:56:06,730 --> 01:56:12,030
Don't be disheartened, child. You can
only see light with open eyes.

872
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:18,750
Go, love everyone.
This is your atonement.

873
01:56:22,180 --> 01:56:27,840
But society has rejected me.
No one loves me.

874
01:56:28,830 --> 01:56:35,880
- I do.
- What did you say? You love me?

875
01:56:37,340 --> 01:56:43,330
Those who are rejected
have truly earned my love.

876
01:56:44,990 --> 01:56:50,590
Who are you, with
a voice that drips with nectar?

877
01:56:51,650 --> 01:56:54,650
Gautam. They call me Buddha.

878
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:02,350
Lord Buddha, purest of the pure?

879
01:57:10,690 --> 01:57:13,970
Take me under your wing.
Enlighten me, lord.

880
01:57:15,580 --> 01:57:23,520
I certainly will, but you must
apologize to the world first.

881
01:57:24,210 --> 01:57:30,430
Love those you have hurt,
and beg them for love.

882
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:33,400
Only then will you be
worthy of the world's love.

883
01:57:39,950 --> 01:57:41,350
As you wish, lord.

884
01:57:43,220 --> 01:57:51,220
I take refuge in Buddha

885
01:57:54,340 --> 01:58:02,340
I take refuge in Dhamma

886
01:58:06,540 --> 01:58:11,790
I take refuge in Sangha.

887
01:58:22,210 --> 01:58:28,090
- Who is it?
- Don't fear me.

888
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:35,300
I am Ahinsak now, not Angulimala.

889
01:58:35,770 --> 01:58:43,770
- Ahinsak?
- Who, mother?

890
01:58:45,930 --> 01:58:47,030
Ahinsak!

891
01:58:57,360 --> 01:59:05,360
I looked for you everywhere.
You've changed so much.

892
01:59:10,860 --> 01:59:13,540
Yes, mother, I've
changed completely.

893
01:59:14,940 --> 01:59:21,380
Today I've seen Lord
Buddha and my mother.

894
01:59:22,610 --> 01:59:27,220
I'm blessed, lord. At last
you've heard my prayers.

895
01:59:28,490 --> 01:59:33,780
- Ahinsak, come home now.
- Home? What home, mother?

896
01:59:35,180 --> 01:59:40,100
The whole world is my home now.
Lord Buddha has given me refuge.

897
01:59:40,900 --> 01:59:45,100
Under him, I will wash away my
sins and apologize to everyone.

898
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:51,540
- I'll love everyone.
- Where you were bad, you were only mine.

899
01:59:53,020 --> 01:59:56,430
Now, when you're good,
you're no longer mine.

900
01:59:57,040 --> 02:00:04,580
Yes, mother, I was only yours until
now. Now, I belong to the world.

901
02:00:06,300 --> 02:00:10,490
Bless me, mother, so
that I am victorious.

902
02:00:11,960 --> 02:00:17,420
How can we forgive someone
guilty of numerous murders?

903
02:00:17,700 --> 02:00:23,770
My lord, I am the criminal,
not Ahinsak. I should be punished.

904
02:00:24,450 --> 02:00:28,300
No, my lord. The real
criminal is the father...

905
02:00:29,290 --> 02:00:33,020
who kicked out his son
and forced him into sin.

906
02:00:33,930 --> 02:00:35,230
Praise the king.

907
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:39,880
We've searched the entire forest,
but we couldn't find Angulimala.

908
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:44,250
Is this a joke? You couldn't find
one man in all this time?

909
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:51,540
I order you to bring him
to the capital before sunset.

910
02:00:52,060 --> 02:00:58,430
Father, Ahinsak has reached a place
punishment cannot reach.

911
02:00:58,610 --> 02:01:06,610
Maya, you? Where were
you all this while?

912
02:01:09,230 --> 02:01:13,460
Father, your forgiveness
doesn't matter now.

913
02:01:15,160 --> 02:01:18,050
Lord Buddha himself
has given him refuge.

914
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:22,190
Punishment cannot even
touch him now, father.

915
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:23,900
What are you saying?

916
02:01:24,410 --> 02:01:29,010
Weapons and soldiers
couldn't overpower him...

917
02:01:29,310 --> 02:01:34,960
- but love did.
- But how will the people be pacified?

918
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:40,376
Father, he's gone to ask
them for forgiveness.

919
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:41,500
Daughter!

920
02:01:49,900 --> 02:01:54,810
Angulimala! Run! Angulimala has come!

921
02:02:15,310 --> 02:02:23,310
Listen to me. Don't fear me.

922
02:02:26,030 --> 02:02:31,540
I've come to apologize.
Please forgive me.

923
02:02:32,410 --> 02:02:34,750
Don't be afraid.

924
02:02:35,730 --> 02:02:41,290
Lord Buddha extinguished the fire
of enmity and violence in my heart...

925
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:44,620
with the cool water
of love and peace.

926
02:02:45,970 --> 02:02:51,620
I now know that love erases
hatred, not more hatred.

927
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:57,910
I've come here to love you
and ask for you love.

928
02:02:58,620 --> 02:03:01,660
- Give it to me.
- Murder this murderer!

929
02:03:02,730 --> 02:03:10,730
[Buddhist chant]

930
02:03:13,980 --> 02:03:17,000
We've caught him
with great difficulty. Hit him!

931
02:03:24,610 --> 02:03:26,490
- No!
- Move away, princess.

932
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:29,380
Forgive him. Don't hit him.

933
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:39,340
He is no longer Angulimala.
He's Ahinsak once again.

934
02:03:44,500 --> 02:03:48,660
He's taken numerous lives.
He can't escape today.

935
02:03:52,270 --> 02:03:58,000
Quiet! What are you doing?
It's a sin to hit him.

936
02:03:59,250 --> 02:04:04,720
- Ahinsak, forgive me.
- What are you doing?

937
02:04:05,050 --> 02:04:10,080
Maruti told me everything.
I pushed you towards sin.

938
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:13,050
- Forgive me.
- Don't say that, teacher.

939
02:04:14,290 --> 02:04:16,190
If you hadn't
kicked me out that day...

940
02:04:16,970 --> 02:04:18,990
how would I have
reached Lord Buddha?

941
02:04:21,650 --> 02:04:27,890
- Allow me, princess.
- I'm coming, too.

942
02:04:28,670 --> 02:04:31,870
- Where?
- To Lord Buddha.

943
02:04:33,950 --> 02:04:36,740
Our paths are the same.

944
02:04:39,300 --> 02:04:42,350
I take refuge in Buddha.

945
02:04:43,020 --> 02:04:45,280
I take refuge in Dhamma.

946
02:04:45,820 --> 02:04:48,620
I take refuge in Sangha.

947
02:04:55,770 --> 02:05:03,770
The one who has extinguished
darkness from restless hearts

948
02:05:13,230 --> 02:05:21,230
Whose one ray has
lit up the world

949
02:05:34,510 --> 02:05:38,240
May the lamp of truth remain lit

950
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:42,000
May mercy and peace flourish

951
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:49,970
May his love remain where
joy and peace reside

952
02:05:52,190 --> 02:05:59,880
May Lord Buddha's chant
echo in every household

953
02:05:59,970 --> 02:06:03,650
Oh human, chant every day

954
02:06:03,810 --> 02:06:07,700
I take refuge in Buddha

955
02:06:19,600 --> 02:06:23,030
I take refuge in Dhamma

956
02:06:23,070 --> 02:06:27,060
I take refuge in Sangha
