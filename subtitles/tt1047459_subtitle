1
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:44,242
Faith is where empathy is
With rage there is sin

2
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:50,246
Hatred finds place in hell
Forgiveness is where He is

3
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:10,266
Awaken! -

4
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:25,385
Dawn is breaking... -

5
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:45,504
Washing away the cover of darkness

6
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:51,167
Dawn is breaking...

7
00:01:53,446 --> 00:02:00,614
Awaken!

8
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:44,327
May Lord Shiva bless you

9
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,932
Shake away the mist of dreams

10
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,729
Focus on the task at hand

11
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:07,783
It will take you down
the path to salvation

12
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:11,889
Every direction beckons you -

13
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:15,891
Aboard the boat of life -

14
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:24,570
- You'll be carried by
the holy river's tide

15
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:29,905
- Dawn is breaking...

16
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:36,275
- Awaken!

17
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:56,263
'Accept this offering O Keshava'

18
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:01,331
'Accept this offering O Narayana'

19
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:07,776
'Accept this prayer,
O Mighty Sun God'

20
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:14,281
'O Lord, creator of the universe remove
our miseries, vices and sorrows'

21
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:18,350
'Give us the ability
to lead upright, good lives'

22
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:21,953
- The fluttering leaves point the way

23
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:33,632
- The river flows as it cleanses your sins -

24
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:41,906
- And the temple bells sound
the presence of the Lord

25
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:57,462
- Dawn is breaking...

26
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,393
- Awaken! O traveler-

27
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,500
- Life is passing you by-

28
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:06,968
- Hold on to that faint string...
- and do what is only right

29
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:17,346
- Dawn is breaking

30
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,500
Welcome

31
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,342
I seek your blessings Punditji

32
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,344
You're late as usual

33
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:51,740
It's almost afternoon

34
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,512
I reached home late last night
after a wedding ceremony...

35
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:59,153
My 3 year old son was
crying relentlessly...

36
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,457
due to an upset stomach

37
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:02,794
I fell asleep, putting him to bed

38
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,654
Before I knew it,
the Sun God had risen

39
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,896
The sun doesn't rise according to
your convenience, Daya Shankar

40
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,704
Leading life by the rising and setting of
the sun is the duty of every Brahmin priest

41
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:21,877
And ostentation isn't the
objective of prayer

42
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,118
You may find gullible customers...

43
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:31,048
but you won't find God

44
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:46,870
Forgive me Punditji,
I didn't see you

45
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,497
How dare you touch and
defile Pundit Chaturvedi!

46
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:54,339
I am sorry Punditji.
Please forgive me

47
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:59,014
Kalua! Mallah! Come here... Hurry!

48
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,518
He's defiled Pundit Chaturvedi

49
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:03,689
Beat him up

50
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,193
Stop!

51
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:15,860
Stop! Don't hit him

52
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:22,897
'O Lord purify my mind, body and soul'

53
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:23,803
What's going on?

54
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,269
We are Brahmins

55
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,740
Lord Brahma himself gave us
this most superior caste

56
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:36,679
Even the shadow of that lowly
untouchable shouldn't fall on us

57
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,684
And he touched Pundit Chaturvedi!

58
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:42,720
'May this thread of Lord Brahma confer
upon me knowledge and wisdom'

59
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:58,473
Greetings Punditji

60
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:04,048
That poor man was beaten up
for your sake

61
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,907
And you didn't intervene?

62
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,380
Why should he?

63
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:11,912
That lowly fool has defiled
Pundit Chaturvedi

64
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:17,694
The divine light created by the Lord is
the genesis of all mankind

65
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,091
Then how can one man be
different from another?

66
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,065
Our scriptures also state this.
Don't they?

67
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,131
Are you trying to teach
Punditji the scriptures?

68
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:31,068
We challenge you to a debate with him

69
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,136
Shyam!

70
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,311
Lord Shiva has blessed me with
the knowledge of the scriptures

71
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:55,827
What about the truth of life?

72
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,000
Hail, the mighty Lord Shiva

73
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:12,583
- Awaken!
- Dawn is breaking

74
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:17,449
I'm sending sweets to your house...
offer them to the God sin your prayers

75
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,124
Thank you. My daughter
will bring the money

76
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:24,362
Punditji, what did that mystic mean?

77
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,290
Knowing the meaning is not enough

78
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:33,203
To understand religion,
one must live by its tenets

79
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,539
The world is full of so called mystics

80
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:43,011
If you want to grasp the true essence of the Hindu
religion pay attention to Punditji's teachings

81
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:45,250
Understand Mr. Paul?

82
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,566
Goras Nath, I'm not going to
change my mind,

83
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,370
I will not to be a part of any
religious propaganda

84
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:18,207
My child, come back in an hour

85
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,748
'I recite the names of the places
where you dwell'

86
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,483
'My sins from 7 lifetimes will be
destroyed by this recollection'

87
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:32,096
'By merely looking at your image...

88
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:36,997
'I'll no longer be touched by sin'

89
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:40,428
'I pray to you morning and
evening, O Lord'

90
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,943
'Detach me from Karma,
so I can only live to please you'

91
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,613
'Hail, the mighty Lord Shiva! '

92
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,536
'You are the incarnation of compassion'

93
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,139
'You're the very essence of life'

94
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,536
'Your eternal abode is the
heart of your devotee'

95
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,677
'I bow to you Lord Shiva and
your consort Parvati'

96
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,550
'My Lord Shiva is the one in eternal bliss'

97
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:32,883
'The one who is resplendent
and omnipresent'

98
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,993
'The one who embodies the scriptures'

99
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:45,570
'The one who is limitless and pure
like the sky. I adore you'

100
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:46,738
'O beloved Lord of all...

101
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:47,405
with shimmering jewels in his ears'

102
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,074
'Your beautiful large eyes...

103
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:59,742
full of mercy and a cheerful countenance.
I adore you'

104
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:05,584
'Hail, the mighty Lord Shiva'

105
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,061
May the mighty Lord Shiva bless you

106
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:34,075
Be careful. Do not eat street food or
take a helping from others

107
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:38,020
Communal riots broke out in Bhadohi
early this morning...

108
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,849
persons from a minority community
are reported dead

109
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,491
Many homes have been burnt down

110
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,464
What sparked off this Hindu-Muslim riot?

111
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,430
Hindu-Muslim animosity is part of our history

112
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,397
Any small scuffle...

113
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:54,968
can trigger a riot

114
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:12,548
Which means...

115
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:14,958
father and son...

116
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:16,917
husband and wife...

117
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:23,469
relatives and brothers
can forsake each other

118
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:31,408
But Mother Ganges never forsakes...

119
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:36,471
who-so-ever takes a dip
in Her holy waters

120
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:39,981
The River Goddess Ganges...

121
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:46,148
washes away his sins
and liberates him

122
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:47,715
In this modern world...

123
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,552
where virtues are disappearing...

124
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:58,129
we are fortunate for the
presence of Mother Ganges

125
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,898
Are your students late today?

126
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,869
Or have I finished my chores early?

127
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,832
All you have been quick at,
is forgetting, Parvati

128
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,941
Will you teach the students...

129
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,675
while I perform the prayers at
Vishnu Singh's house?

130
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:51,319
Today, is the fire ritual for Surya Prakash, let's hope
the Gods drive some sense into his head

131
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,022
He is unlike his father

132
00:14:56,128 --> 00:15:04,502
So hot headed

133
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,741
This may take a lot of time

134
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,934
Many lifetimes I believe

135
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,676
I was referring to the fire ritual

136
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:19,146
That won't take much time

137
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:29,185
So, you won't be able to eat before noon

138
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:36,264
I am a Brahmin.
I feed the soul first

139
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:39,828
But you must eat.
Don't wait for me

140
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:51,015
The doctor has adviced you to eat on time

141
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:57,649
I am a brahmin's wife.
I know what is good for my soul

142
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,789
I will wait for you

143
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:04,253
You're a woman

144
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:09,001
You needn't live by the rule
sprescribed for men

145
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:09,865
I know

146
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:15,203
The scriptures also prescribe that
every woman be a dutiful wife -

147
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:19,410
Pativrat

148
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:27,450
Punditji!

149
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,449
I read somewhere that a woman's...
Pativrat Dharm

150
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,285
dictates she must obey all of
her husband's wishes

151
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,357
It is written in the Manu Smriti

152
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:44,492
In chapter 9, verse 154 - 55

153
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,293
Very good my child

154
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:07,552
Paul, a woman without husband
has no status in society

155
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:31,277
What are you learning from Punditji today?

156
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:37,854
We're on an interesting subject
A woman's Dharma as a dutiful wife

157
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,459
You've performed good deeds
in your past life...

158
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:43,927
to have the good fortune to come
all the way to India...

159
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,928
and learn about our religion and
culture from Punditji

160
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,458
And some unfortunate people,
despite being born here...

161
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,493
Shut up! Just shut up!

162
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:54,670
Don't interfere, Prabha

163
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,372
I have decided she won't go

164
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,533
She wants to study.
- Please let her go

165
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:02,045
Keep your mouth shut!

166
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:10,146
Punditji, do I have to be apart of the ritual?

167
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,659
It was difficult convincing
father to let me study further

168
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:16,852
Today is the last day for
submitting the application

169
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,826
But my brother says...
- You've studied enough!

170
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,472
There is a ceremony in the house
and she wants to go and study

171
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:29,236
You keep quiet, father!

172
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,639
Educated girls have neither
virtues nor values

173
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:34,973
Values!

174
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:42,046
Good values require that you
don't talk down to anyone...

175
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,524
especially to your father

176
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,963
As far as Mani is concerned...

177
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,296
she is not required at this prayer

178
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,594
Vishnu Singhji may allow her to leave

179
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:02,340
You may go, my child

180
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,573
Prabha will look after the
prayer preparations

181
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:07,944
Then, I will not be a part of this ceremony

182
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:09,672
You'll do as I say!

183
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:16,579
His ritual will take place...

184
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,586
and you will be a part of it

185
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,705
Pundit Chaturvedi is encouraging
her bad behaviour

186
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:15,479
If the elder brother is forbidding it,
why does he need to butt in?

187
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:17,673
He thinks he is God

188
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,784
And father and the foolish people
of Benares believe he is God

189
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:24,587
He is not!

190
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,952
And still he insists on controlling
everyone's life

191
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,096
You scoundrel!
Don't I know you'd love the same

192
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:39,298
You'd love to have Pundit Chaturvedi's
job and status

193
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,001
Welcome, sir.

194
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:45,602
Come, pray. Peace for father,
grandfather, your dead

195
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:47,837
That is ridiculous!

196
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:51,174
So what if he holds the highest
post of priesthood...

197
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:52,813
My knowledge is no less than his

198
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:55,909
Welcome madam

199
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,681
Perform the invocation ceremony,
seek the blessings of River Ganges

200
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,311
Ma'am, fees

201
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:29,843
You're doing well for yourself

202
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:32,315
You get to touch these sexy foreigners

203
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,221
need to earn my living.

204
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:39,426
Your father doesn't pay for my expenses
like he does for Pundit Chaturvedi

205
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:42,925
That's because you aren't the
Head Priest of our temple

206
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:45,863
Wouldn't you love to be the Head Priest?

207
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:08,853
- Dawn is breaking -

208
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:18,368
- Washing away the cover of darkness -

209
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:27,341
- Awaken! -

210
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,608
Whose baby is this?

211
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:45,996
What's wrong?

212
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,466
Vedika was playing outside.
A woman was thirsty

213
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:53,104
She gave Vedika the baby
and went to drink water

214
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:55,065
She didn't return

215
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:56,307
What?

216
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,577
You brought in a child from the street?

217
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,237
Not knowing his caste,
how dare you touch him?

218
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:04,777
It's a Brahmin's child

219
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:07,852
Vedika had asked the mother

220
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:12,353
You shouldn't have brought the baby home

221
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:14,450
His mother must be worried

222
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,521
Go back and wait for her

223
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,761
Vedika waited for 4 hours.
She didn't return

224
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:25,561
I hope all is well

225
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:29,833
You did tell her that you were
Punditji's daughter, didn't you?

226
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,773
Then she'll surely find her way here

227
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,713
You can go into the temple.
Everything's ready

228
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:40,778
Take him there. Play with him

229
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:58,261
Will you do the morning prayers
in the afternoon?

230
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:03,268
I have to boil milk for the child

231
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:04,839
He'll be hungry when he wakes up1

232
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,143
He'll disrupt Vedika's studies

233
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,840
He has already disrupted your
duties towards God

234
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:15,076
What if he was our own child?

235
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:20,918
I'm sure God will forgive the delay

236
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,620
He knows everything

237
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:27,326
You are right. God is omniscient

238
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:06,001
You little brat!

239
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:09,233
Mother, look what he has done!

240
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,239
I'll iron another uniform for you

241
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:14,801
Go, take a bath

242
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,707
I rushed home after the temple prayers...

243
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:23,245
to prepare everything for your father

244
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:28,654
But this little one is intent on delaying me

245
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:44,607
Vedika!

246
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,341
Pick him up!

247
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,071
I can't. I'm going for a bath.
I'll get late

248
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:54,413
I'll pick him when I finish
preparing the prayer plate

249
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:00,553
It's almost done

250
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:03,226
I'll just bring the plate

251
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,563
'Salutations to the mighty Lord Shiva'

252
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,254
Your love for this child has blinded you

253
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,052
I will have to bathe again

254
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,632
Has he made you bathe twice?

255
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:21,663
Mother, I'm leaving

256
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:24,431
I'll get your breakfast
- Mother, I've had the gruel

257
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:27,772
He was crying so much...

258
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:31,307
I thought Mani would be
here to mind him...

259
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,110
but she didn't come

260
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:35,246
I should've made your breakfast

261
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:39,287
I can take care of myself

262
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:42,458
From tomorrow, I'll wake up early
and help you...

263
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,128
That won't be necessary

264
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,954
If the child's mother doesn't
show up by tomorrow...

265
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,965
Inspector Sharma will take him away

266
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,537
It's good that you have come, dear

267
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:59,773
Wash your hands and make some
wheat pancakes for me

268
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:03,513
Or I too will have to eat gruel or
fodder meant for the cow

269
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:53,764
- How do I open my heart to you?

270
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:57,423
- I am devoted only to you

271
00:28:57,635 --> 00:29:02,766
- My lord and master

272
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:06,876
- You are my world

273
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:13,444
- The colour of your love...

274
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:16,279
- Is the colour I wear

275
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:18,786
- Oh my lord, my love

276
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:28,023
- I am devoted only to you

277
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:31,794
Bastard! How dare you take
photographs of my sister!

278
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:40,206
Please don't beat him.
It's not his fault

279
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:45,474
- All that I see is you
Don't hit him so much that he dies

280
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:50,814
- My words speak only of you... -

281
00:29:51,022 --> 00:30:01,865
- Even as the tears of love

282
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:07,094
- Wash away the kohl in my eyes

283
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:14,643
- You remain my beloved

284
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,904
The fault lies with our own people

285
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:18,480
They still suck upto these foreigners...

286
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:20,776
in the guise of providing
them knowledge

287
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:24,682
Punditji has come

288
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:37,024
You should get your daughter
married immediately

289
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:48,932
I will now tell you the
duty of a father...

290
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:53,406
as prescribed by the scriptures...

291
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,152
which means...

292
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:08,181
the groom's family,
his temperament, health...

293
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:18,197
reputation, knowledge, wealth and
the good deeds of his ancestors

294
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,731
Only by adhering to these 7 virtues...

295
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:24,902
can a daughter be given away
in marriage

296
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,941
And it is the duty of the daughter...

297
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:35,648
to aid her father in this task

298
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:41,790
Have you understood that my child?

299
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,490
Now listen to me!

300
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:48,823
If you dare to venture out of the house...

301
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,068
I will drown you and that foreigner
in the Ganges

302
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:54,667
Do you understand?

303
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:32,709
- Like the river flows into the ocean

304
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:40,040
- My being flows into yours

305
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:50,057
- The sound of your flute

306
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:52,229
- will lead me to you -

307
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,198
Your presence saved Paul

308
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,293
Had something serious happened to him...

309
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:01,601
Surya Prakash wouldn't have got bail

310
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:08,041
Any news of the child's mother?

311
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,172
I checked with the Police control room

312
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:18,419
No child has been reported
missing in this locality

313
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,027
Is there no way to trace the child's mother?

314
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,530
I can check in other villages
around Benares

315
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,355
But that will take some time...

316
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:31,395
About a week

317
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:37,331
If no complaint has been lodged...

318
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,340
it's unlikely you will find her

319
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,770
The woman has abandoned the child

320
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:47,377
It is your belief that...

321
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:51,044
everything is preordained

322
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:59,455
May be, God has sent us
this child for a purpose

323
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:05,895
Till Inspector Sharma gets
more information...

324
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,768
shall we keep the child?

325
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:41,863
Lmprove your punctuation
- Yes, father

326
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:49,371
Come here, my child

327
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,946
What happened on television today?

328
00:35:57,788 --> 00:35:59,119
Thanks to this little one...

329
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,655
I couldn't go to Gayatri's house
to watch T.V.

330
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,825
Your little one could be
a blessing in disguise

331
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:25,707
All girls are born with a maternal instinct

332
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:33,681
I wish Vedika gets married
to a handsome young man...

333
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:38,522
Vedika's marriage will not be
according to your wishes...

334
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,324
but where it is destined

335
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:46,737
Fate preordains every relationship
in the world

336
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:49,901
You are lying to me

337
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,576
She's eloped!
And you have no clue?

338
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:56,338
I'll kill you, I'll kill everyone

339
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,809
I'll destroy this entire house

340
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:08,685
Have you gone mad!

341
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:11,727
Put that down!

342
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,293
Mani has driven me mad!

343
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,362
How will we face the world?

344
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,607
You and Pundit Chaturvedi have caused this

345
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:38,816
I've lost both my children, Punditji

346
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,554
What should I do now?

347
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:56,902
If Mani was your daughter,
what would you do?

348
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:06,911
I wouldn't be able to do anything

349
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,419
A girl who weds by her own choice...

350
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,424
is responsible for her own deeds

351
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:26,064
Consider her dead

352
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:33,499
Had Pandit Chaturvedi not entertained Paul
you wouldn't have to see this day

353
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:46,023
How dare you step on the holy flowers!

354
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,521
These non-believers have sworn
to defile our religion!

355
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:51,862
I'll teach you a lesson

356
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:52,688
Leave me

357
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:59,035
Stop it. Relax. Calm down!

358
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:01,864
Nothing can be achieved by
what you are doing

359
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,471
We need to protect our way of life,
our Dharma

360
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:10,304
Come join us in our fight
against all non-believers

361
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:24,224
Hail, the Mighty Lord Shiva

362
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,067
- To protect our religion...

363
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:39,072
- it's our duty to destroy its enemies

364
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:42,412
- Our culture demands this from us

365
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:47,407
Our religion is the most ancient
and the purest

366
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:52,745
Foreigners and non-Hindu forces are
constantly attacking our religion

367
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,922
Do not deviate from the path
you have chosen to tread

368
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:59,585
It is your path to salvation

369
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:07,434
Pray that we continue to march ahead
protecting our religion, our Dharma

370
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:09,265
May our endeavors succeed!

371
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:17,614
What happened my child?

372
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:21,110
I'll be with you in a while...
Have some patience

373
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:25,778
Quiet my child.
I'll sieve the flour and be with you.

374
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:35,664
Have some patience

375
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:41,168
I cannot touch you till I finish cooking

376
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:43,358
I'll have to bathe again
- Will you calm him down?!

377
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:47,696
I can't do anything,
till I serve your meal

378
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:50,703
Do you expect me to entertain him?
- Could you?

379
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,878
It will calm him down

380
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:59,216
You needn't touch him

381
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:45,595
There has been no news
of the child's mother.

382
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:51,757
We can send the child to
the government orphanage.

383
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:57,433
The government orphanage
will not be appropriate.

384
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:10,610
It's God's will that a Brahmin's child
has come to our house

385
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:17,791
The temple orphanage is
where he will be sent

386
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:28,969
I don't know how to decipher God's will...

387
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:32,301
but I've been thinking of something

388
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:35,304
You've started thinking?

389
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:44,980
Lord Shiva, have mercy!

390
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:55,331
Don't let the thought weigh on your mind...

391
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:59,335
speak out...

392
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:03,002
else you won't be able to sleep tonight

393
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:13,640
There is no one better than you at teaching
religion and the scriptures

394
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:22,515
Maybe, God wants this child to
learn religious values from you...

395
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:25,854
like you'd teach your own child

396
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:35,868
Are you suggesting we adopt the child?

397
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:43,709
What if his mother comes back?

398
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:49,709
Then the child will be fortunate to have
the love of two mothers

399
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:52,889
Like the son of Lord Shiva.

400
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,634
Kartikey!

401
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:47,442
Parvati!

402
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:44,995
Why are you wailing?

403
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,336
You've disrupted my meditation!

404
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:52,166
Do you think I'm here to entertain you?

405
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:42,785
'My Lord Shiva, I adore you'

406
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:45,757
'You're the one in eternal bliss'

407
00:47:45,963 --> 00:48:06,841
'Limitless and pure like the sky'

408
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:19,019
'I adore you'

409
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:20,526
'My Lord Shiva, I adore you'

410
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,700
- My Lord Shiva, I adore you -

411
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,392
- You're the one in eternal bliss,
I adore you -

412
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:28,969
- My Lord Shiva, I adore you -

413
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:34,200
- Limitless and pure like the sky,
I adore you -

414
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,477
- I'd left him sleeping on the swing

415
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:10,806
- He must have said,"Bauji, pick me up"

416
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:14,651
- Quiet. Your father is sleeping

417
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:48,514
Kartikey

418
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:57,851
- Father, look at me

419
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:08,924
'Hail, the mighty Lord Shiva'

420
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,767
We have a swing!

421
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:15,594
'You are the one who embodies the scriptures'

422
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:18,775
Quiet, father is praying

423
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:22,876
'The one who is resplendent and omnipresent'

424
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:27,346
'The one who is limitless and pure
like the sky. I adore you'

425
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:02,143
Father!

426
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:09,321
Mother!

427
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:24,503
Father!

428
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:40,352
Hello!

429
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:41,046
I can perform the prayer for your
new house over the phone

430
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:45,023
It won't even mess up your house

431
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:50,856
Money? You can send it to
my website address

432
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:52,864
Ok. Good day

433
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:55,537
Sorry. It must be good night over there

434
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:58,374
Call from America

435
00:52:58,575 --> 00:52:59,371
- Here comes Punditji

436
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:07,883
That was his client from America

437
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:11,382
Pundit Daya Shankarji has become world famous

438
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:25,900
We are suppose to serve and
not sell our religion

439
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:29,738
What's wrong with that?

440
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:32,233
Everyone should adapt to
the changing times

441
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:37,071
The Truth doesn't change with time

442
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:39,578
What our scriptures prescribe
is the greatest truth

443
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:44,413
But you won't understand that

444
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:47,751
Coming, son!

445
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:18,620
Come in, Daya Shankar

446
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:20,286
No, I am fine where I am

447
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:32,461
That child... that Vedika had brought home

448
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:40,805
The one Punditji considers his son
and you call Kartikey

449
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:44,640
His mother is here to take him

450
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:51,313
She had escaped to Benares
from the riot in Bhadohi

451
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:54,149
Parched, she fainted on the riverside

452
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:56,985
People admitted her to the
government hospital

453
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:09,168
The loss of her child made
her mentally unstable

454
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:10,339
Where is Kartikey's mother?

455
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:13,334
It's about time you met

456
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:16,671
I met her at the riverside,
looking for your house

457
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:18,339
Please come in...

458
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:25,514
Your entry into this house
cannot be prohibited

459
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:38,362
My name is Nafeesa

460
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:44,863
I run Dar-ul-Mohsenaat,
an institute for destitute woman

461
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:50,371
And she is Suraiya

462
00:55:57,053 --> 00:55:59,021
She is Mustafa's mother

463
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:04,522
May Allah bless you for
sheltering her son

464
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:08,388
How is this possible! He...

465
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:15,901
- The child was very small
They hadn't circumcised him

466
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:23,068
- When the riots started in Bhadohi
she ran away to save her child's life

467
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:25,246
I found her at the government hospital

468
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:28,414
- She was not in her senses

469
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:31,917
- It took her a few years to
even speak properly

470
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:35,420
We visited many police stations
in and around Benares

471
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:40,426
We'd almost given up,
when we met Inspector Sharma

472
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:45,260
We bumped into Daya Shankarji
who brought us to you

473
00:56:53,643 --> 00:56:54,610
Vedika

474
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:23,968
Mother, no! Please don't let him go

475
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:25,641
- Mother, I don't want to go

476
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:27,139
- Sister

477
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:29,645
- Sister

478
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:40,315
Take him away.

479
00:57:40,557 --> 00:57:41,990
Father...

480
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:47,826
I don't want to go

481
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:07,509
Father!

482
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:30,706
- Quiet, father is praying

483
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:51,612
'We pray O Lord...

484
00:59:51,821 --> 00:59:53,948
that you purify this home...

485
00:59:54,157 --> 01:00:03,088
cleanse our bodies, minds and souls'

486
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,807
'Accept this offering O Keshava'

487
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:22,476
'Accept this offering O Narayana'

488
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,658
'Accept this offering O Madhava'

489
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:43,498
'Accept this offering O Govinda'

490
01:00:57,553 --> 01:00:59,020
I want to...

491
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:09,190
I don't want any justification

492
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:14,533
I'll punish myself for your sins

493
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:20,535
You couldn't control your tongue...

494
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:24,546
so I'll hold back mine

495
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:30,447
From this very moment...

496
01:01:32,088 --> 01:01:33,555
for indefinite time...

497
01:01:33,756 --> 01:01:38,284
I take on the penance of silence

498
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:16,364
- Quiet, father is praying

499
01:03:52,728 --> 01:03:55,026
You've cleansed yourself

500
01:03:56,399 --> 01:04:02,634
God knows that it wasn't your fault

501
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:10,876
You needn't break your silence...

502
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:17,986
but please resume your duties
at the temple

503
01:04:29,932 --> 01:04:32,400
- Father, I dropped the vermillion

504
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:45,412
Pundit Chaturvedi! The purest!
The ultimate in priesthood!

505
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:48,579
Fooled by his wife!

506
01:04:50,286 --> 01:04:51,412
He ranks as a non-believer

507
01:04:52,755 --> 01:04:55,952
The Muslim child has defiled
his temple and home.

508
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:59,425
All the cleansing is a cover up!

509
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:03,028
But what about Surya Prakashji's
temple affairs?

510
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,758
Do you still hanker for thatjob?

511
01:05:06,535 --> 01:05:07,934
You are wealthy now

512
01:05:09,305 --> 01:05:11,432
It's not the job...

513
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:16,371
but the person who runs that temple...

514
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:22,114
must be physically, mentally,
and spiritually pure

515
01:05:26,155 --> 01:05:30,114
Pundit Chaturvedi, is impure now

516
01:05:30,893 --> 01:05:32,190
Are you in your senses?

517
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,622
Pundit Chaturvedi has purified himself!

518
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:41,196
He should be removed from the position

519
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:44,196
Not as long as I am alive

520
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:48,405
Once again, you're wrong

521
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:56,477
I have endured Pandit Chaturvedi so far

522
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:57,653
But, not any longer

523
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:00,488
Will you remove him forcefully?

524
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:02,155
For that con man, Daya Shankar?

525
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:03,321
Con man?

526
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:06,494
I'd rather have a con man than
an impure man run my temple

527
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:08,762
And if you don't agree, father...

528
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:12,228
I'll force him to step down

529
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:15,894
Alright, Surya Prakash

530
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:19,898
You have Daya Shankar, Gorasnath...

531
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:23,102
the power of your organisation

532
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,506
And Pundit Chaturvedi...

533
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:29,879
has the strength of his faith

534
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:31,881
I challenge all of you!

535
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:38,519
- If you prove Punditji's impurity...

536
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:45,029
- I will end this relationship with him

537
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:47,664
God, you are the omniscient

538
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:57,707
I'm unable to purify my thoughts
and my heart

539
01:07:03,919 --> 01:07:07,150
Despite my penance...

540
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:13,388
I am tormented

541
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:22,061
Give me the strength to surrender
to you completely

542
01:07:26,342 --> 01:07:27,741
The kind of strength...

543
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:35,580
that will lead me to you

544
01:08:39,014 --> 01:08:41,710
Father has broken his silence

545
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:50,554
On this moonless night...

546
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:55,159
I take on the Chandrayan Vrat

547
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,287
Where is Punditji?

548
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:25,859
He can't talk to you

549
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:33,195
Is he hiding behind the oath of silence?

550
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:35,697
He is doing his prayers

551
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:43,200
To atone for his sin she's taken
on another penance

552
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:44,303
Another one?

553
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:47,715
What penance will he do now?

554
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:51,877
Chandrayan

555
01:09:56,258 --> 01:09:57,452
Chandrayan Vrat?

556
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:32,926
- Are you sure?

557
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:35,161
What's this penance all about?

558
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:42,597
The Chandrayan Vrat is the most
arduous penance in the scriptures

559
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:48,273
After the moonless night,
the devotee has to eat...

560
01:10:48,877 --> 01:10:53,439
1 morsel on the first day,
2 morsels on the second...

561
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:57,448
increasing 1 morsel per day...

562
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:03,121
reaching 15 morsels on the full moon night

563
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:06,957
After the full moon night...

564
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:12,798
the devotee reduces a morsel a day

565
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:15,798
14 morsels, then 13 and so on...

566
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:17,965
till the moonless night

567
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:24,136
Apart from this, he can not eat
or drink anything

568
01:15:56,118 --> 01:16:00,578
O Lord, with Your grace...

569
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:03,487
I complete the Chandrayan Vrat today

570
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:09,254
Any trace of sin in my deeds...

571
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:17,697
I surrender to you in this fire

572
01:16:19,808 --> 01:16:21,776
Give me the strength, O Lord...

573
01:16:22,878 --> 01:16:25,108
to continue to walk your path...

574
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:29,776
despite all impediments

575
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:53,634
Forgive me...

576
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:58,210
for committing such a grave sin

577
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:04,649
I'll never stray from my duty again

578
01:17:10,859 --> 01:17:13,157
I forgive you

579
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:24,161
I've prayed to God with all my heart and soul

580
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:31,669
I hope He forgives me

581
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:05,604
The penance is over, right mother?

582
01:18:06,982 --> 01:18:09,382
Yes, it is over

583
01:18:14,589 --> 01:18:15,954
A petty squabble amongst a group
of Muslims and Hindus...

584
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:17,716
has turned into a communal riot...

585
01:18:17,926 --> 01:18:20,326
in Sewapuri, a small town near Benares

586
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:27,526
To control the situation additional
forces have been deployed

587
01:18:27,769 --> 01:18:51,423
98 people are injured and 38 killed

588
01:18:51,593 --> 01:18:59,227
Some bodies are charred
beyond recognition

589
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:02,870
Paul Gordon, a foreign journalist,
has been killed in this riot

590
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:05,665
Paul was writing a book
on the Hindu religion

591
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:08,602
- Who are you?
What are you doing here?

592
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:11,446
- I am a journalist, please leave me alone

593
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,670
- Surya Prakash is right

594
01:19:39,341 --> 01:19:41,309
- Mani can't live in this house

595
01:19:41,676 --> 01:19:44,236
- Where will she go?

596
01:19:44,546 --> 01:19:47,515
- Your stubbornness has caused this nuisance

597
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:53,546
- She is my daughter. I will not abandon her

598
01:19:53,755 --> 01:19:55,245
- Wait till Punditji arrives

599
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:57,924
He'll drill some sense into you

600
01:20:46,608 --> 01:20:48,872
This is an emergency

601
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:55,644
It is true that...

602
01:20:57,452 --> 01:21:00,546
Mani had abandoned this house...

603
01:21:03,258 --> 01:21:09,891
but, being the father of a widow...

604
01:21:11,766 --> 01:21:14,667
it is your duty,
according to the scriptures...

605
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:22,302
to provide for her food, clothing...

606
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:28,414
shelter, medicines etc

607
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:18,460
- The communal violence that
originated in Sewapuri...

608
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:20,635
- has spread like wild fire to Benares

609
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:28,968
- To control the situation,
a curfew has been clamped...

610
01:22:29,177 --> 01:22:32,146
- in the Muslim areas of the city

611
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:34,975
- Rioting and arson have been
reported from many areas...

612
01:22:35,183 --> 01:22:37,344
- in the ancient holy city of Benares

613
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:27,531
Mother!

614
01:23:31,573 --> 01:23:33,871
'My Lord Shiva, the one in eternal bliss'

615
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:41,038
'You embody the scriptures.
You are resplendent, omnipresent'

616
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:44,218
Mother!

617
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:49,720
'You are limitless and pure like the sky'

618
01:23:50,658 --> 01:23:53,559
'I adore you'

619
01:23:54,262 --> 01:23:55,388
- Please listen! Open the door

620
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:57,393
Mother, Kartikey is here

621
01:23:58,933 --> 01:24:01,731
- 'O benevolent Lord of the Himalayas'

622
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:03,735
- 'O eternal soul'

623
01:24:03,938 --> 01:24:05,565
Riots have broken out in our area

624
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:09,409
It was tough bringing Mustafa here

625
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:12,512
- Kartik, he's your Kartik

626
01:24:14,582 --> 01:24:19,246
- 'You are beyond human knowledge'
- Only you can save him

627
01:24:19,454 --> 01:24:26,257
- 'O destroyer of evil. I bow to you'
- Please protect him

628
01:24:26,661 --> 01:24:28,652
- Open the door! They will kill him

629
01:24:28,863 --> 01:24:31,923
- 'The Ganges is Your crown'
- Please open the door

630
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:35,534
- 'The cresent moon Your ornament'

631
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:44,839
- 'You dwell in all living beings'
- Allah is watching you!

632
01:24:45,046 --> 01:24:53,351
- 'O Lord and Master,
I adore You'- Please save this innocent life

633
01:24:53,721 --> 01:24:56,349
You are his mother! He is your Kartik!

634
01:24:56,558 --> 01:25:00,289
How can you beso stone hearted?

635
01:25:00,495 --> 01:25:00,961
- 'O beloved Lord of all'

636
01:25:01,563 --> 01:25:09,800
- 'Your beautiful large eyes are... '
- For God sake, help us

637
01:25:10,004 --> 01:25:13,701
- 'always full of mercy'
- Please don't let him die!

638
01:25:15,076 --> 01:25:17,306
Let him in, mother

639
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:19,246
Call your mother

640
01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:21,245
Call out to her

641
01:25:21,916 --> 01:25:24,248
Call her again!

642
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:32,653
- 'I bow prostrate to You'
- Call out to your father

643
01:25:33,695 --> 01:25:35,663
Quiet, father is praying!

644
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:38,159
'O my Lord Shiva...

645
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:42,665
I adore You'

646
01:25:46,574 --> 01:25:47,666
Hail, the mighty Lord Shiva

647
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:01,072
By not taking him back...

648
01:27:04,652 --> 01:27:06,847
we've fulfilled our duty as Hindus

649
01:27:10,458 --> 01:27:10,924
Haven't we?

650
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:40,278
Another prayer ceremony...

651
01:27:40,488 --> 01:27:44,618
to calm my restless mind

652
01:27:46,027 --> 01:27:48,291
With a calm mind...

653
01:27:49,564 --> 01:27:51,464
- I shall perform my duty tonight

654
01:27:56,571 --> 01:27:59,768
- I've heard, one of them tried to escape

655
01:27:59,974 --> 01:28:03,603
- No. He was nabbed!

656
01:28:03,811 --> 01:28:06,974
- The real task was done by Pandharee

657
01:28:07,181 --> 01:28:08,546
- What did he do?

658
01:28:09,083 --> 01:28:12,814
- Like those Muslims stabbed
the Hindu to death...

659
01:28:13,021 --> 01:28:15,387
- Pandharee did the same...

660
01:28:17,592 --> 01:28:23,292
- Women, old men, children,
he spared no one

661
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:26,994
- Our religion is being destroyed...

662
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:29,669
- by the non-believers

663
01:28:29,871 --> 01:28:36,743
- We will teach them a lesson tonight

664
01:28:36,944 --> 01:28:38,809
- Not one will be left alive

665
01:28:39,013 --> 01:28:42,346
- We'll kill them all!

666
01:28:55,063 --> 01:28:56,587
This is a very auspicious day

667
01:28:56,798 --> 01:28:58,459
Today, as a Brahmin,
you pray for our faith

668
01:28:58,666 --> 01:29:00,258
and Surya Prakashji...

669
01:29:00,802 --> 01:29:03,032
will protect our faith, as a warrior

670
01:29:03,638 --> 01:29:06,038
It's time all of us fulfill our duties...

671
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:09,334
to protect our faith, our religion

672
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:47,078
It's not easy to abandon the one you love

673
01:30:01,129 --> 01:30:04,496
The divine light created by the Lord...

674
01:30:04,699 --> 01:30:07,099
is the genesis of all mankind

675
01:30:07,301 --> 01:30:10,202
Then how can one man...

676
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:13,238
be different from another?

677
01:30:27,989 --> 01:30:30,753
Hail, the mighty Lord Shiva!

678
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:24,635
Surya Prakash...

679
01:36:25,446 --> 01:36:26,811
violence is a grave sin!

680
01:36:27,348 --> 01:36:28,645
This is a do or die situation

681
01:36:28,849 --> 01:36:31,147
Sermons won't work here.
Only the sword will

682
01:36:31,852 --> 01:36:33,479
Goras, get him!

683
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:47,498
- Mustafa

684
01:36:51,705 --> 01:36:53,832
Love for that child has misled this priest!

685
01:36:54,708 --> 01:36:56,608
I'll kill him!

686
01:37:05,653 --> 01:37:08,121
From the day you were born,

687
01:37:08,322 --> 01:37:10,517
I have tried to teach you the
meaning of religion

688
01:37:12,326 --> 01:37:14,317
I will not let you tread the path of sin

689
01:37:33,981 --> 01:37:39,146
Religion is not only devotion...

690
01:37:40,221 --> 01:37:44,453
but also duty and deeds

691
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:49,725
Religion is unity and brotherhood

692
01:37:51,298 --> 01:37:53,664
Religion means looking beyond
caste and creed

693
01:37:55,769 --> 01:37:57,566
Humanity is religion

694
01:38:01,275 --> 01:38:02,071
This...

695
01:38:05,613 --> 01:38:06,580
This...

696
01:38:11,385 --> 01:38:12,249
this...

697
01:38:17,958 --> 01:38:19,425
this is not religion

698
01:38:49,323 --> 01:38:52,383
'As You lead us...

699
01:38:52,593 --> 01:38:57,621
to the place you dwell...

700
01:39:00,401 --> 01:39:02,961
our sins of seven life times...

701
01:39:03,170 --> 01:39:06,628
will be destroyed'

702
01:39:47,881 --> 01:39:54,411
- Oh Lord of the heavens

703
01:39:55,222 --> 01:40:01,183
- Blessed is thy name

704
01:40:02,296 --> 01:40:07,598
- Be it God, be it Allah
You are the same

705
01:40:08,068 --> 01:40:14,405
- Grant us all this wisdom -
