1
00:02:56,852 --> 00:03:01,846
My dear girl
Stop...don't go

2
00:03:03,692 --> 00:03:09,358
'ln a Naxalite-attack in West Bengal
a sub-inspector, few policemen...

3
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:10,955
'...and several others were killed'

4
00:03:11,032 --> 00:03:15,867
'The police are now on a witch-hunt
for Naxal leader Charu Majumdar'

5
00:03:21,276 --> 00:03:22,641
l killed him

6
00:05:49,024 --> 00:05:55,987
'Yours Forever,
Moideen'

7
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,619
'Hail Mary
Full of grace'

8
00:08:33,688 --> 00:08:37,886
'The Lord is with you
Blessed are you among women'

9
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:42,396
'Blessed is the fruit
of your womb, Jesus'

10
00:08:42,463 --> 00:08:47,400
'Holy Mary, Mother of God
Pray for us sinners'

11
00:08:47,468 --> 00:08:49,561
'Now and at the hour
of our death'

12
00:08:49,637 --> 00:08:51,628
'We pray to you'

13
00:08:58,947 --> 00:09:00,608
Kanchanamala

14
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:07,219
Why aren't you attending
the prayer session?

15
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,582
Answer me, girl
Why did you stay away?

16
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,984
l will not attend
prayers hereafter

17
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,286
What audacity!

18
00:09:15,363 --> 00:09:18,389
When everyone else is
attending, why can't you?

19
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:21,433
Does equality exist only
to matters relating to God?

20
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:23,833
All of us kneel as equals
and pray in front of God...

21
00:09:23,905 --> 00:09:27,363
...but the food we are served
is discriminated in the canteen

22
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:30,505
Students from affluent families
are served 'A' class food

23
00:09:30,712 --> 00:09:33,704
Students in the little
lesser bracket get 'B' class

24
00:09:34,349 --> 00:09:37,546
She is Merina, who's being served
'C' class food in this convent

25
00:09:37,652 --> 00:09:41,315
The 'C' class food is arranged by
the Church for poor Catholic students

26
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:44,790
Then may be Hindus and Muslims
should convert to Christianity?

27
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,457
Leela, put some sense into her

28
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:53,467
She has a point, sister

29
00:09:53,735 --> 00:09:57,466
lt is difficult for us to sit together
and eat food served differently

30
00:09:57,605 --> 00:09:59,971
When we get back after
our December vacation...

31
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,906
...this issue must be solved

32
00:10:02,277 --> 00:10:06,338
Otherwise we will resort to
other ways of insulting the Church

33
00:10:06,915 --> 00:10:08,439
Don't forget!

34
00:10:11,452 --> 00:10:14,546
After our vacation, we will
deal with the rest of the issue

35
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,789
Hope no one has a problem
to starve tonight?

36
00:10:17,859 --> 00:10:20,350
We are prepared to do
anything you suggest

37
00:10:20,428 --> 00:10:23,625
'Lord Messiah of
the King of miracles'

38
00:10:23,698 --> 00:10:25,996
'Please turn the water
in our stomach...'

39
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:28,292
'...into 'roti' and chicken'

40
00:11:09,277 --> 00:11:09,709
Ramachandra?

41
00:11:09,744 --> 00:11:10,506
Come here

42
00:11:10,578 --> 00:11:12,011
- Where the hell were you?
- l was inside

43
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,645
Call the musicians

44
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,046
Okay, father

45
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:18,277
Festival arrangements
are fantastic, Madhava

46
00:11:18,453 --> 00:11:21,718
Our Goddess should not lack
in any way in being honored

47
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:24,019
Kottatil festival is as good as
Mukkam celebrating it

48
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:25,657
We can't do a slipshod job

49
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,355
Ramachandra, did you see
my son anywhere?

50
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,531
Where the hell is he?

51
00:11:54,322 --> 00:11:55,812
What are you doing here?

52
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,085
l...that is, where is Ram'etan?

53
00:11:58,359 --> 00:11:59,690
l was looking for him

54
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,087
He is at the temple

55
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:03,456
The lamp from the store room
must be placed on the verandah

56
00:12:03,531 --> 00:12:05,897
The workers won't do it
properly, come with me

57
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,496
Come, man

58
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,988
Greetings

59
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:41,301
- Hope l am not late
- Not at all

60
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:42,393
Come

61
00:13:16,604 --> 00:13:19,971
There is a divine strength
l get from here every year

62
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,339
Don't go around
saying this in public

63
00:13:22,477 --> 00:13:25,275
Your people won't tolerate it
even if you are Sultan!

64
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,914
God blesses anyone who
comes to Him with a good heart

65
00:13:28,983 --> 00:13:31,781
Gods are beyond
caste and religion

66
00:13:57,078 --> 00:14:00,377
What is the use of
material wealth, Madhava?

67
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,278
A home should be
filled with good children

68
00:14:04,252 --> 00:14:05,844
ln that respect
you are blessed

69
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,014
Look at your daughters
standing like 6 shining stars

70
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,724
Which one wants
to be a doctor?

71
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:13,350
The one over there

72
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,691
Studying in Little Flower Convent

73
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:17,289
A little mischievous
But very studious

74
00:14:17,365 --> 00:14:20,459
We need a doctor in our own
home town, don't we, Sahib?

75
00:14:20,535 --> 00:14:21,695
Sure, we do

76
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:25,603
Madhava, your children will
become doctors and lawyers

77
00:14:25,706 --> 00:14:28,607
Education is the best asset these days

78
00:14:29,177 --> 00:14:31,873
Why hasn't Moideen come?

79
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,570
lf he was here, he would have
clicked pictures of all this

80
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,980
He knows l'd be here today

81
00:14:38,386 --> 00:14:40,877
lndia is not lndira

82
00:14:40,988 --> 00:14:44,014
That slogan represents autocracy

83
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:46,783
ln spite of a quarter century
since we got freedom...

84
00:14:47,028 --> 00:14:52,466
...we are seeing only an increasing
number of poverty stricken people

85
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,065
ls this the free lndia
we dreamed of?

86
00:14:55,336 --> 00:15:00,740
We socialists must serve people
with slogans of democracy

87
00:15:00,808 --> 00:15:03,743
Of equality and brotherhood

88
00:15:03,844 --> 00:15:07,780
Our national architect
Nehru was a true democrat

89
00:15:07,848 --> 00:15:09,406
But his daughter lndira?

90
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:10,575
She was not

91
00:15:10,651 --> 00:15:11,845
lndian National Congress-

92
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,511
Stop it, Manu

93
00:15:15,489 --> 00:15:18,322
Your father is a staunch Congressman
and you are a stubborn Socialist

94
00:15:18,392 --> 00:15:20,826
And we are caught
between the two

95
00:15:21,596 --> 00:15:25,362
My father burned clothes
supporting the Freedom movement

96
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:28,668
To him lndira Gandhi
is almost like Gandhiji

97
00:15:28,869 --> 00:15:30,302
Wind up all this

98
00:15:30,371 --> 00:15:31,395
Your father will be
back any moment

99
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,439
Let him come, mother

100
00:15:32,506 --> 00:15:35,737
Our country will hereafter be ruled
only by Socialist party, not the Congress

101
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,640
Go now, mother

102
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:39,737
Even God can't win
an argument with you

103
00:15:43,718 --> 00:15:45,049
Coming back to our subject

104
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,617
Our black flag demonstration
tomorrow at Kozhikode...

105
00:15:47,755 --> 00:15:51,691
...will be in protest against
lndira's wrong policies

106
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:57,664
The People's Socialist Party
will keep its word at any cost

107
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:00,030
Good Lord!

108
00:16:00,301 --> 00:16:01,563
Run! 'Tiger' has come

109
00:16:01,636 --> 00:16:03,365
Where the hell
are you all running off to?

110
00:16:03,437 --> 00:16:04,961
Run...run

111
00:16:28,896 --> 00:16:31,023
What rubbish are you
planning to put into effect?

112
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:32,899
l have warned you many times

113
00:16:32,967 --> 00:16:35,936
Keep your Socialism and
Communism outside our house

114
00:16:36,003 --> 00:16:37,868
Don't you understand?

115
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:40,566
But l have not committed
any crime betraying my country

116
00:16:40,741 --> 00:16:41,605
Of course it is

117
00:16:41,676 --> 00:16:43,303
This is betrayal

118
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:47,344
Can your socialist wastrels come
anywhere near a Congress man?

119
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,311
Maybe not but they can
take over Mukkam

120
00:16:50,518 --> 00:16:52,315
l must die
for it to happen

121
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,722
l am a Congressman from
Abdul Rehman's times

122
00:16:56,957 --> 00:17:00,449
And it was Congress who made me
Panchayat president of Mukkam

123
00:17:00,528 --> 00:17:02,587
lndian National Congress
no longer exists

124
00:17:02,663 --> 00:17:04,221
lt is now
lndira Gandhi Congress

125
00:17:04,298 --> 00:17:04,957
Congress (l)

126
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,665
Stop it

127
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,860
Are you teaching me politics?

128
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:10,733
What are you doing?

129
00:17:10,805 --> 00:17:12,272
You keep quiet

130
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:16,299
You are the one allowing
these rebels to raise their heads

131
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:21,840
Madhavan's daughter will
become a doctor after 2 years

132
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:22,905
And you?

133
00:17:22,983 --> 00:17:27,317
Shouting out slogans and living
for the sake of some loafers

134
00:17:27,521 --> 00:17:30,615
Someone has to benefit
from your well-loaded body

135
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:34,249
lsn't that why we are planning
a black flag protest tomorrow?

136
00:17:36,397 --> 00:17:38,262
Black flag demonstration?

137
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,891
lt will affect me adversely

138
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,861
lf you carry out
this dirty deed-

139
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:52,913
'Brave Moideen'

140
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,280
'Pearl of Mukkam, Moideen'

141
00:17:57,318 --> 00:18:01,311
'Our treasure Moideen'

142
00:18:01,389 --> 00:18:05,325
'Lead on bravely'

143
00:18:05,393 --> 00:18:09,625
'Millions will support you'

144
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:12,689
'The con men of Mukkam'

145
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:14,894
He has been bruised
black and blue

146
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,903
'Long live Moideen'

147
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:21,567
The police broke his hand for
protesting against lndira Gandhi

148
00:18:21,742 --> 00:18:23,733
So what? At least
he showed spunk

149
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,904
lf father is Sultan
then son is Pasha!

150
00:18:26,247 --> 00:18:28,010
We need a smart youngster
like him in Mukkam

151
00:18:28,282 --> 00:18:31,740
'We shall retaliate'

152
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,713
There will be retaliation for sure

153
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,848
His is pitting his silly Socialism
against lndiraji's charisma

154
00:18:37,925 --> 00:18:39,290
He has been beaten up badly

155
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,987
He deserves more

156
00:18:41,262 --> 00:18:43,628
He must be beaten and
thrown into the river

157
00:18:43,697 --> 00:18:46,359
This is what happens to people
who dare oppose lndiraji

158
00:18:46,434 --> 00:18:48,402
'Eye for eye
Tooth for tooth'

159
00:18:48,469 --> 00:18:51,438
Enough! Stop it now

160
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:57,372
Lower him gently

161
00:18:58,946 --> 00:19:01,346
All of you leave now
Let him take rest

162
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:03,341
Okay, see you Manu'ikkaka

163
00:19:04,718 --> 00:19:07,243
How dare lndiraji
play against Moideen!

164
00:19:07,421 --> 00:19:08,820
Moideen, come

165
00:19:14,428 --> 00:19:15,793
Manu'ikkaka, take care

166
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,657
Sit here

167
00:19:18,966 --> 00:19:20,228
Nice and easy

168
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,928
lf Sultan sahib sees me here
l'll be a corpse instead

169
00:19:24,004 --> 00:19:24,732
l am leaving

170
00:19:24,805 --> 00:19:27,000
How dare they-

171
00:19:27,274 --> 00:19:28,832
Wait...don't go

172
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,375
Hey! Don't take it off

173
00:19:31,445 --> 00:19:33,345
Give it time to heal

174
00:19:34,648 --> 00:19:36,309
You weren't
actually beaten up?

175
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,908
Getting beaten is
not the criteria

176
00:19:38,986 --> 00:19:40,715
You must know
how to market it

177
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:42,312
Now look who l am today

178
00:19:42,523 --> 00:19:46,823
lf l stood for election in Mukkam
even l will get a few votes

179
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,725
Who broke your hand?

180
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:50,889
My hands?
Who will dare to?

181
00:19:50,931 --> 00:19:54,367
Be it the police or army...

182
00:19:54,468 --> 00:19:56,561
...if they punch you
give it right back

183
00:19:56,637 --> 00:19:57,934
You don't have to worry at all

184
00:19:58,005 --> 00:20:00,337
All those holding posts
high up there...

185
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,035
...have been fed
by these hands

186
00:20:11,652 --> 00:20:12,949
We are all for Congress

187
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,853
Till we breathe our last
Gandhiji's path is our way of life

188
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,788
Madhav'etta, you must find a way out

189
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:20,521
We want to enact the drama
'You made me into a communist'

190
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,355
Scared of the police, no one is
giving us a place to erect the stage

191
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,297
Long ago when A.K.Gopalan
was in hiding at Mukkam...

192
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:29,461
...it was Unni'chetan
and l who sheltered him

193
00:20:29,537 --> 00:20:31,767
l am not considering
the political angle

194
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,033
We are aware of that

195
00:20:33,307 --> 00:20:36,834
lsn't that why
we came to you for help?

196
00:20:37,678 --> 00:20:39,873
- Rama?
- Coming

197
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,484
Our field at Areekode is lying
idle after harvests, isn't it?

198
00:20:45,586 --> 00:20:46,985
Clear it up and level it

199
00:20:47,054 --> 00:20:49,614
They have to build
a stage there next week

200
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,084
You carry on

201
00:20:55,729 --> 00:20:58,459
Hey! You are at it
early this morning

202
00:20:58,566 --> 00:21:00,659
Why don't you stay back
one more day?

203
00:21:00,768 --> 00:21:01,962
Go tomorrow

204
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,736
Nothing doing

205
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,795
We'll meet next vacation

206
00:21:05,873 --> 00:21:07,363
See you, okay?

207
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:10,372
Radha'edathi, we must
go to the temple

208
00:21:10,444 --> 00:21:11,536
Hurry up

209
00:21:11,612 --> 00:21:13,546
Still at it?
l'm going, okay?

210
00:21:13,614 --> 00:21:15,047
Kanchana?
Why don't you-

211
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:16,977
l know you want me to stay back

212
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:19,576
lt's not happening
See you, my dear

213
00:21:19,853 --> 00:21:21,980
Ma, not ready yet?

214
00:21:22,056 --> 00:21:23,921
Father is already yelling

215
00:21:24,425 --> 00:21:26,791
'Koralappam'
Almost done

216
00:21:27,428 --> 00:21:28,895
Give it to her

217
00:21:29,363 --> 00:21:30,694
l clean forgot

218
00:21:30,764 --> 00:21:32,629
lf l go back without
your famous snack...

219
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,758
...Leela will kill me

220
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,859
lt's become routine now

221
00:21:35,936 --> 00:21:37,494
Shall l go, mother?

222
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,030
Ma, don't start now

223
00:21:41,075 --> 00:21:43,771
l postponed going back
just because of these tears

224
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,945
10 day-vacation
has become 11

225
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,641
l will be back soon

226
00:21:48,315 --> 00:21:51,079
Mother is always
extra fond of Kanchana

227
00:21:51,952 --> 00:21:53,579
Don't make faces at me, okay?

228
00:21:55,656 --> 00:21:57,954
Stop your mischief-stint in college

229
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,022
Everyone is anxious to
see you become a doctor

230
00:22:02,296 --> 00:22:05,788
All that will happen, mother
There goes father again

231
00:22:07,568 --> 00:22:09,297
l'll take leave, ma

232
00:22:15,442 --> 00:22:16,909
Shut up, crow

233
00:22:18,946 --> 00:22:20,743
Parukuttyamma,
l am leaving, okay?

234
00:22:20,814 --> 00:22:22,805
- When are you back?
- Next vacation

235
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:25,950
Come here

236
00:22:26,787 --> 00:22:29,017
When will you
come here next?

237
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:31,018
Be quiet and
show me your hand

238
00:22:32,926 --> 00:22:34,416
Open it and see

239
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,492
lsn't it made of gold?

240
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,626
lt's an old one

241
00:22:42,703 --> 00:22:45,035
And a little damaged
You can repair it and use it

242
00:22:46,006 --> 00:22:47,940
Brother is calling me, see you

243
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:49,702
Coming

244
00:22:50,878 --> 00:22:52,402
What were you doing?

245
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:54,447
What if it rains and
the place gets flooded?

246
00:22:54,481 --> 00:22:55,539
Get in quick

247
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:01,353
Did you take an umbrella?

248
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:02,582
Yes, l did

249
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:10,761
lt was here, year before last
Moideen, Nair and Bhasi put up a play

250
00:23:10,831 --> 00:23:13,265
l remember very well
'Kootukrishi' right?

251
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:14,561
Exactly

252
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,438
What happened, brother?

253
00:23:20,808 --> 00:23:21,934
Let me see

254
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,586
What is it?

255
00:23:38,726 --> 00:23:41,786
This vehicle always has a problem

256
00:23:41,862 --> 00:23:44,763
lf l am absent today also
l don't have to go at all

257
00:23:45,532 --> 00:23:47,056
lf you run for it
you can catch the bus

258
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:48,824
Okay, l am going

259
00:23:50,771 --> 00:23:51,999
My brother will deal with it

260
00:23:52,072 --> 00:23:53,733
l can carry your suitcase

261
00:24:07,588 --> 00:24:09,351
Get down

262
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,314
Kunnamangalam to Kozhikode

263
00:24:12,392 --> 00:24:14,792
Get in quick

264
00:24:17,765 --> 00:24:18,823
Sit there

265
00:24:18,899 --> 00:24:19,763
No, it's okay

266
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,960
lf you touch me
you'll be regarded 'unclean'

267
00:24:22,035 --> 00:24:24,526
lf l don't, only then
l will become 'unclean'!

268
00:24:24,805 --> 00:24:26,466
Go...get going

269
00:24:29,943 --> 00:24:31,501
Answer me

270
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:35,705
l really don't know

271
00:24:38,719 --> 00:24:41,517
You received one such parcel
previously in your name too

272
00:24:41,588 --> 00:24:43,783
A book letter without
a sender's address

273
00:24:43,891 --> 00:24:45,722
Was that also without
your knowledge?

274
00:24:45,793 --> 00:24:47,624
Yes, madam
l don't know

275
00:24:47,828 --> 00:24:50,058
One can never win
an argument with you

276
00:25:11,318 --> 00:25:13,377
lt was only because
of Kanchanamala...

277
00:25:13,453 --> 00:25:15,648
...we eat together now
without discrimination

278
00:25:16,824 --> 00:25:20,521
True, we never used
to get anything to eat

279
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,896
Kanchana, why are you not eating?

280
00:25:33,941 --> 00:25:35,806
l don't feel too good

281
00:25:37,044 --> 00:25:38,443
l don't want to eat

282
00:25:38,512 --> 00:25:39,570
Carry on

283
00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:59,850
(re-arranging jumbled letters)

284
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,415
'M-O-l-D-E-'

285
00:29:12,492 --> 00:29:14,585
Theyyathin Kadavu
Get down...get down

286
00:29:16,363 --> 00:29:17,796
Let's go

287
00:31:40,307 --> 00:31:42,673
'The Good Lord
showers His Grace'

288
00:31:42,709 --> 00:31:45,041
'He said, it is not good
for man to be alone'

289
00:31:45,312 --> 00:31:47,974
He proclaimed, 'l will make a helper
who is just right for him'

290
00:31:49,082 --> 00:31:51,073
'Listen! That is the voice
of my dearest one'

291
00:31:51,351 --> 00:31:56,379
'Across vales and hills
he comes skipping towards me'

292
00:31:58,992 --> 00:32:03,395
'My beloved is like
a gazelle or a young stag...'

293
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:07,832
'...gazing through the windows,
peering through the lattice'

294
00:32:07,934 --> 00:32:10,732
'He stands behind a wall

295
00:32:20,447 --> 00:32:22,847
'He whispers to me'

296
00:32:22,882 --> 00:32:27,649
'My darling, my beloved
My beautiful one, arise'

297
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:34,893
- How come you are here?
- Football match

298
00:32:35,395 --> 00:32:36,453
lnside the church?!

299
00:32:39,966 --> 00:32:42,025
l got out of the house
using that as excuse

300
00:32:42,302 --> 00:32:44,736
'Flowers have started
blossoming on earth'

301
00:32:44,804 --> 00:32:47,068
'lt's time to begin a song'

302
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,070
'The doves have started
cooing in our land'

303
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,537
Outside...

304
00:32:51,778 --> 00:32:53,405
...it's raining

305
00:32:53,647 --> 00:32:55,410
'Flowers of grapes
have started blooming'

306
00:32:55,582 --> 00:32:57,516
'They sway spreading
their scented fragrance'

307
00:32:57,584 --> 00:32:58,812
Shall we get drenched?

308
00:33:44,831 --> 00:33:49,632
''Eyes spoke, in vocal silence''

309
00:33:49,703 --> 00:33:54,299
''My dear parakeet from a distance''

310
00:33:54,374 --> 00:33:58,902
''As lips expressed in a soft whisper
what the heart ached to hear''

311
00:33:58,978 --> 00:34:03,608
''...when the pretty parakeet was near''

312
00:34:03,683 --> 00:34:08,382
''Upon the branches of the portia tree''

313
00:34:08,455 --> 00:34:12,892
''...a pair of birds roosted happily''

314
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:17,328
''From the chariot-like rainbow in harmony''

315
00:34:17,397 --> 00:34:22,391
''...raindrops showered to keep company''

316
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:25,734
''Rain added to their rhapsody''

317
00:34:26,906 --> 00:34:31,434
''Eyes spoke, in vocal silence''

318
00:34:31,745 --> 00:34:36,682
''My dearest parrot from a distance''

319
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:54,425
''Along rippling
streams murmuring''

320
00:34:55,535 --> 00:34:59,471
''And paths of fields flowering''

321
00:35:00,073 --> 00:35:04,703
''Along rippling streams murmuring
And paths of fields flowering''

322
00:35:04,778 --> 00:35:12,947
''A secret whispered soft
into wind's ears aloft''

323
00:35:14,287 --> 00:35:18,451
''Like a song composed from above''

324
00:35:18,591 --> 00:35:22,994
''The crashing crescendo of first love''

325
00:35:23,263 --> 00:35:27,791
''ln this shower upon yonder hills
the clouds ran in dancing frills''

326
00:35:27,867 --> 00:35:32,702
''Searching for this river flowing
like a vestal virgin glowing''

327
00:35:32,772 --> 00:35:36,572
''Like a lake soaked in moonlight''

328
00:35:36,643 --> 00:35:40,943
''And moon like a boat bobbing bright''

329
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:46,018
''Eyes spoke, in vocal silence''

330
00:35:46,319 --> 00:35:50,881
''To my dear parakeet from a distance''

331
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:55,589
''As lips expressed in a soft whisper
what the heart ached to hear''

332
00:35:55,628 --> 00:35:59,758
''...when the pretty parakeet was near''

333
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:04,496
''Upon the branches of the portia tree''

334
00:36:04,804 --> 00:36:09,434
''...a pair of birds roosted lovingly''

335
00:36:09,609 --> 00:36:14,012
''From the chariot-like rainbow in harmony''

336
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,307
''...raindrops showered to keep company''

337
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:22,548
''Rain added to the rhapsody''

338
00:37:06,499 --> 00:37:08,296
There are so many items

339
00:37:08,368 --> 00:37:11,303
My employer's son Kottatil Sethu
fell down while playing ball

340
00:37:11,371 --> 00:37:12,668
His shoulder is injured

341
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:13,637
The doctor said so

342
00:37:13,706 --> 00:37:15,833
Now pack it up
and give me quick

343
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,605
l think it's a dislocation

344
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:22,011
You've been repeating this
for quite some time

345
00:37:24,984 --> 00:37:27,418
Move aside!
l need some light

346
00:37:32,325 --> 00:37:36,318
lf you mix 'marvati' and 'marmani' oils
in equal proportions and massage...

347
00:37:36,529 --> 00:37:38,622
...the dislocation will disappear in a wink

348
00:37:38,698 --> 00:37:39,892
So you think!

349
00:37:45,939 --> 00:37:48,931
Stop grinning and
get me the ayurvedic oil

350
00:37:49,008 --> 00:37:50,441
Now move aside

351
00:38:13,399 --> 00:38:14,593
Doctor

352
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,662
What are you doing?

353
00:38:17,737 --> 00:38:19,398
Are you playing ball with his arm?

354
00:38:19,439 --> 00:38:20,406
lt will take some time

355
00:38:20,473 --> 00:38:21,565
Don't hurry me, please

356
00:38:21,641 --> 00:38:23,802
Why don't you admit
you can't cure him?

357
00:38:24,277 --> 00:38:25,642
God! My arm

358
00:38:27,647 --> 00:38:28,978
Can l have some water?

359
00:38:29,248 --> 00:38:30,408
l'll get it

360
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:40,684
The physician asked
for some water

361
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,728
Give it to me
l'll get it

362
00:38:45,565 --> 00:38:46,725
Why didn't you come there?

363
00:38:46,899 --> 00:38:47,729
l didn't want to see

364
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,496
l was quite scared
hearing him scream in pain

365
00:39:02,482 --> 00:39:05,246
Appu, what is the doctor saying?

366
00:39:05,318 --> 00:39:06,785
The dislocation is quite severe

367
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,653
He will be bedridden
for at least 3 months

368
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,621
He said it vehemently

369
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:11,950
Didn't he, Kanchana?

370
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:20,229
Dear God! Your uncle and
father won't spare me now

371
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:25,802
They keep accusing me of
encouraging him to play football

372
00:39:26,773 --> 00:39:28,798
Where do we now go
for further treatment?

373
00:39:29,475 --> 00:39:30,840
What are you looking for?

374
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,241
Where is water stored?

375
00:39:32,311 --> 00:39:34,438
- Look, it's right there
- Oh! l forgot!

376
00:39:34,514 --> 00:39:36,573
What's wrong with this girl?

377
00:39:36,783 --> 00:39:38,876
No need to take him anywhere
He can be treated right here

378
00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:40,714
Our Dr Thottam is the best

379
00:39:40,787 --> 00:39:42,550
lsn't he, Kanchana?

380
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,521
Come here, my girl
Pinch out the leaves

381
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:56,027
Ramachandran is running
around with bank issues

382
00:39:56,335 --> 00:39:58,530
Sahadevan is looking
after the theatre

383
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,936
Everyone has 101 things to do

384
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,602
Aunty, you needn't worry

385
00:40:02,675 --> 00:40:04,336
After all l am
Sethu's closest cousin

386
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:06,275
l'll look after him

387
00:40:06,746 --> 00:40:09,840
Even if it's difficult and
how many ever months...

388
00:40:09,916 --> 00:40:12,043
...l'll stay right here
till he's better

389
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:14,445
lt's my duty after all

390
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,520
Stop killing him like this

391
00:40:16,589 --> 00:40:18,454
Take him somewhere else

392
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,055
Doctor, come away

393
00:40:23,396 --> 00:40:25,421
Don't take unnecessary risk, Moideen

394
00:40:25,498 --> 00:40:26,965
lt's a dislocation of
a vital part of the body

395
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:28,557
Hey! No

396
00:40:28,668 --> 00:40:29,828
Don't

397
00:40:29,902 --> 00:40:31,995
Stop wriggling, Sethu

398
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:33,897
This is not foot ball

399
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,565
He'll foul up for sure!

400
00:40:36,609 --> 00:40:37,735
That's it

401
00:40:49,856 --> 00:40:51,448
Hey! Moideen
lt is fixed now

402
00:40:51,524 --> 00:40:54,015
l told you, it was very simple

403
00:40:54,093 --> 00:40:56,084
But what to do if he resists?!

404
00:40:56,462 --> 00:40:57,622
What are you doing?

405
00:40:57,864 --> 00:40:59,525
Lie down

406
00:40:59,766 --> 00:41:01,028
lt's a serious condition

407
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:02,562
Why don't you tell him?

408
00:41:02,735 --> 00:41:04,828
lt's nothing
l am cured

409
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:06,763
How did that happen?

410
00:41:06,973 --> 00:41:08,031
lt was just a dislocation

411
00:41:08,307 --> 00:41:10,775
One jerk and Moideen fixed it

412
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:12,333
lt was quite painful

413
00:41:12,411 --> 00:41:13,878
Are you really okay?

414
00:41:13,946 --> 00:41:15,743
Mother, l'm alright now

415
00:41:16,649 --> 00:41:18,947
lt wasn't the doctor
Moideen set it right

416
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,681
Moideen?
He's a smart fellow

417
00:41:32,064 --> 00:41:33,531
Let's leave

418
00:41:33,833 --> 00:41:35,596
Appu, come

419
00:41:35,902 --> 00:41:37,494
Sethu, see you at the ground

420
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,537
Okay

421
00:43:09,595 --> 00:43:11,825
Go and keep it inside

422
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,669
Please drink tea

423
00:43:21,574 --> 00:43:25,032
l cut the tree from my estate
Sawed it in my own mill

424
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,280
Got it made by carpenters
in my own house

425
00:43:28,414 --> 00:43:29,938
This is a little extravagant

426
00:43:30,016 --> 00:43:31,847
You are only saying it
as a formality

427
00:43:31,918 --> 00:43:33,886
When visiting you
for the very first time...

428
00:43:33,953 --> 00:43:35,443
...we have to follow
certain conventions

429
00:43:35,521 --> 00:43:37,682
- What do you say?
- Sure, we must

430
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:41,656
We have heard
a lot about Moideen

431
00:43:41,794 --> 00:43:47,596
Moideen is news in Kozhikode,
Koyilandy, Arukutti and Mavoor

432
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,564
Where is Moideen?

433
00:43:51,704 --> 00:43:52,693
He is not to be seen

434
00:43:52,772 --> 00:43:56,674
'l feel you are pretending
not to have seen me'

435
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:01,837
'Or this must be a ploy
to make me confess first'

436
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:05,245
'Like the peacock feather
we used to treasure as kids...'

437
00:44:05,785 --> 00:44:07,719
'...l want to express my love
l cherished for so long Kanchana'

438
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:10,287
'...that has been nestling in
my heart for long, Kanchana'

439
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:13,858
'l like you so much, Kanchana'

440
00:44:14,794 --> 00:44:15,818
'So very much'

441
00:44:24,971 --> 00:44:27,735
Won't the ground we stand upon
open up and swallow us, Moideen?

442
00:44:28,274 --> 00:44:29,673
Will people allow this?

443
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:33,367
Are you out to create
problems in Mukkam?

444
00:44:36,015 --> 00:44:39,644
lf we follow this river
we reach the Arabian Sea

445
00:44:40,453 --> 00:44:43,980
How many ever times
the boat halts at the pier...

446
00:44:44,857 --> 00:44:47,587
...lruvazhinji river will
reach the Arabian sea

447
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,829
lf lruvazhinji belongs to the sea...

448
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:54,365
...then Kanchana
belongs to me, Moideen

449
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,898
This is my word of honor

450
00:44:58,304 --> 00:45:01,398
A promise made
is truth for keeps

451
00:45:23,662 --> 00:45:26,529
l know very well your word
is as good as a promise

452
00:45:29,468 --> 00:45:32,028
Please come in
l must tell you something

453
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:40,503
Shouldn't we ask him
before we decide?

454
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:41,839
Ask him?

455
00:45:41,914 --> 00:45:43,575
l will decide
He will do it

456
00:45:43,649 --> 00:45:46,311
You take care of
the preparations for lunch

457
00:45:49,989 --> 00:45:53,322
My father built a house for me
Today is the house-warming

458
00:45:53,926 --> 00:45:59,694
lt is father's scheme to control
his wastrel son's wayward ways

459
00:46:00,066 --> 00:46:01,397
l must go there

460
00:46:01,567 --> 00:46:03,501
Otherwise he'll give me
a piece of his mind

461
00:46:03,569 --> 00:46:05,503
l came only for 2 days

462
00:46:06,238 --> 00:46:07,262
l must go back tomorrow

463
00:46:07,339 --> 00:46:09,307
l'm leaving from
my uncle's house

464
00:46:09,408 --> 00:46:10,966
You must write to me, okay?

465
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,618
Not only write letters

466
00:46:27,693 --> 00:46:29,752
l'll come to Kozhikode

467
00:46:29,895 --> 00:46:31,795
To the gates of your college

468
00:46:31,897 --> 00:46:33,865
Or your hostel premises

469
00:46:34,033 --> 00:46:35,967
l can at least
see you that way

470
00:47:19,645 --> 00:47:20,873
Manu'ikkaka

471
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,272
Go, the ferry is here

472
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:25,642
Kunji'ikka

473
00:47:26,252 --> 00:47:27,412
You have a passenger

474
00:47:29,822 --> 00:47:30,880
Kanchana?

475
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,932
l had been to your house

476
00:47:43,602 --> 00:47:46,264
Only then l came to know
you were at your uncle's place

477
00:47:46,839 --> 00:47:47,737
l have...

478
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,468
...something to tell you

479
00:47:50,709 --> 00:47:52,006
What is it, Appu'etta?

480
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:07,988
Why should we wait
till the month of Rajab?

481
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,421
There are auspicious days
before that also

482
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:12,758
Where the hell were you?

483
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:14,763
They have been
waiting to meet you

484
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:16,733
He is Soopi Haji from Poonoor

485
00:48:16,969 --> 00:48:18,493
Rice trader at Valyangadi

486
00:48:18,571 --> 00:48:20,903
Owns acres of paddy fields

487
00:48:21,407 --> 00:48:26,504
We from Mammaliparambu have
ancestral rights at the royal palace

488
00:48:26,812 --> 00:48:29,337
Kerala is now under
the rule of R.Shankar

489
00:48:29,481 --> 00:48:31,642
Didn't royal rule end
long back, father?

490
00:48:34,653 --> 00:48:36,678
Soopi Haji has come
with an alliance

491
00:48:36,822 --> 00:48:39,484
l have consented to you
marrying their daughter

492
00:48:39,525 --> 00:48:41,493
To her elder sister

493
00:48:43,662 --> 00:48:45,596
Perfect date is the 20th

494
00:48:45,664 --> 00:48:46,824
ln the month of Shawwal

495
00:48:47,032 --> 00:48:49,899
The wedding will be held
at Poonoor mosque

496
00:48:52,371 --> 00:48:53,702
Do you approve, mother?

497
00:48:54,039 --> 00:48:57,634
Your mother approves and
your father is very happy

498
00:48:57,710 --> 00:48:59,837
We are waiting
only for your acceptance

499
00:49:01,013 --> 00:49:03,447
Then you shouldn't delay

500
00:49:03,582 --> 00:49:06,278
My mother Pathumma
can do with a helper

501
00:49:06,352 --> 00:49:08,752
lf Sahib weds another woman...

502
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:11,221
...whole of Mukkam
can rejoice happily!

503
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,389
Manu

504
00:49:13,459 --> 00:49:15,290
l don't understand

505
00:49:16,295 --> 00:49:17,853
What did you say?

506
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:23,258
lf Haji insists our families
must bond through marriage...

507
00:49:23,535 --> 00:49:26,504
...he must get his eldest
daughter married to you

508
00:49:31,377 --> 00:49:33,641
Because if at all
there is a girl in my life...

509
00:49:33,712 --> 00:49:35,737
...it will only be Kanchana

510
00:49:37,883 --> 00:49:42,843
lt's a word of honor l have
given her, myself and to God

511
00:49:42,888 --> 00:49:43,912
Which Kanchana?

512
00:49:43,989 --> 00:49:46,457
Kanchanamala of Kottatil house

513
00:50:00,406 --> 00:50:01,600
You dirty rascal!

514
00:50:01,674 --> 00:50:02,936
Don't hit him

515
00:50:06,679 --> 00:50:09,807
l have been tolerating
your atrocities all these years

516
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:13,511
You want to ruin my friendship
with my best friend..

517
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,782
...with your blessed love affair?

518
00:50:15,921 --> 00:50:19,448
You, Unni Moideen Sahib
Advocator of religious tolerance

519
00:50:19,525 --> 00:50:21,459
Why this double standard now?

520
00:50:21,527 --> 00:50:24,621
Has your 'browneye' prayer bump
suddenly become a shade darker?

521
00:50:26,465 --> 00:50:30,060
You dare speak insolently
to your own father?

522
00:50:30,336 --> 00:50:31,860
You'll get it from me

523
00:50:32,705 --> 00:50:33,865
Manu!

524
00:50:42,481 --> 00:50:44,381
- What are you doing?
- Move away, woman

525
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:45,508
Have you gone mad?

526
00:50:45,617 --> 00:50:46,948
He is your son

527
00:50:48,454 --> 00:50:49,682
Get out from here

528
00:50:49,988 --> 00:50:51,717
l don't have a son anymore

529
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:55,590
You don't have any right
over your inheritance

530
00:50:55,694 --> 00:50:57,059
Don't you dare come here

531
00:50:57,329 --> 00:50:59,456
Even to see my dead body

532
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,728
l don't want the money
you have stashed

533
00:51:04,903 --> 00:51:08,839
l have never desired
the assets of this house

534
00:51:09,308 --> 00:51:11,037
But if l am alive,
when you die...

535
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:14,607
...my shoulder also
will carry your coffin

536
00:51:16,982 --> 00:51:21,442
Because l have called
only you 'father'

537
00:51:25,758 --> 00:51:26,952
My son!

538
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:33,593
Ask him to get lost

539
00:51:33,665 --> 00:51:35,997
That house belongs to you also

540
00:51:36,068 --> 00:51:37,729
You don't have to
go anywhere else

541
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:38,963
You can stay with us

542
00:51:39,037 --> 00:51:40,664
You are good at heart

543
00:51:40,739 --> 00:51:43,833
We know you won't
do anything wrong

544
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,077
Go and take rest now

545
00:51:55,521 --> 00:51:56,818
Manu'ikkaka

546
00:51:57,589 --> 00:51:59,955
How did you make her
fall in love with you?

547
00:52:00,058 --> 00:52:02,618
ls she very beautiful?

548
00:52:11,036 --> 00:52:13,300
More beautiful
than her face...

549
00:52:13,372 --> 00:52:14,896
...is her heart, my dear

550
00:52:22,981 --> 00:52:24,312
Look here

551
00:52:24,817 --> 00:52:27,012
Are you very much
in 'lub' with her?

552
00:52:28,887 --> 00:52:30,548
lt's not 'lub'

553
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:32,584
Love

554
00:52:32,658 --> 00:52:34,057
Stop annoying me
Off you go

555
00:52:34,326 --> 00:52:37,625
How will l go for
my tailoring classes now?

556
00:52:37,729 --> 00:52:40,459
The teacher and students there
are your ardent fans

557
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:44,667
l have fooled them so many times
saying l will recommend them

558
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,929
l want a notebook
to write a letter

559
00:52:47,005 --> 00:52:48,404
lt's over there

560
00:52:48,507 --> 00:52:50,737
Why do you have to
scribble notes to and fro?

561
00:52:50,809 --> 00:52:52,003
Why don't you convert her?

562
00:52:52,077 --> 00:52:53,874
Uncle might then agree

563
00:52:54,313 --> 00:52:56,975
lf she converts
l myself will kill her

564
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:14,024
'My dear Kanchana'

565
00:53:14,766 --> 00:53:17,963
'l am trapped in
an unexpected tempest'

566
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:22,271
'l have made up my mind
to go ahead and get drenched'

567
00:53:23,842 --> 00:53:26,003
'Father has thrown me
out of the house'

568
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:30,347
'l am now staying
at my uncle's house'

569
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:35,982
'Doors are being shut
on our faces, Kanchana'

570
00:53:36,688 --> 00:53:41,887
'But we will certainly open
the doors that are shut'

571
00:54:12,357 --> 00:54:13,324
Come here

572
00:54:13,392 --> 00:54:14,916
- What's it, boy?
- Come here

573
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:26,032
- Where is Kanchana'edathi?
- She has gone

574
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:28,000
- Where to?
- College

575
00:54:29,007 --> 00:54:30,269
What is it?

576
00:54:34,513 --> 00:54:35,775
Get lost, boy

577
00:54:48,293 --> 00:54:48,918
Who are you, boy?

578
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:53,431
l am the son of Ramankutty
who sells palmyra torches

579
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:54,726
What's in your hand?

580
00:54:55,033 --> 00:54:55,795
Nothing

581
00:54:55,934 --> 00:54:56,992
Nothing?

582
00:54:57,569 --> 00:54:59,696
Give it here

583
00:54:59,771 --> 00:55:01,864
lt's nothing

584
00:56:26,491 --> 00:56:29,255
Continue reading
the rest of it, girl

585
00:56:29,428 --> 00:56:32,488
'Don't worry about anything'

586
00:56:33,031 --> 00:56:38,025
'ln my mind l have
already given the dowry'

587
00:56:40,372 --> 00:56:44,672
'l don't care who objects
l will be yours only'

588
00:56:45,577 --> 00:56:49,673
'Our love must be carved
on the doors of Heaven'

589
00:56:50,315 --> 00:56:54,979
'lf you are beside me,
that is more than enough'

590
00:56:56,688 --> 00:56:58,679
Read the last line, girl

591
00:57:00,525 --> 00:57:03,460
'Forever yours, Moideen'

592
00:57:08,934 --> 00:57:10,993
ls all this true?

593
00:57:11,937 --> 00:57:14,405
ls there anything going on
between the two of you?

594
00:57:16,274 --> 00:57:18,708
Yes, we like each other

595
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:21,774
l'll punch you like
we pound rotten areca nut

596
00:57:21,847 --> 00:57:23,474
You had better forget him

597
00:57:23,548 --> 00:57:25,709
My dear, think of this
as just a lapse on your part

598
00:57:25,784 --> 00:57:26,842
Forget him

599
00:57:26,918 --> 00:57:29,785
No, mother
l have promised him

600
00:57:30,722 --> 00:57:32,485
A promise made
is truth for keeps

601
00:57:32,557 --> 00:57:35,424
Just selling coconut leaves
from our estates is enough...

602
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:37,359
...for 4 future generations
of Kottatil to live happily

603
00:57:37,429 --> 00:57:40,398
Now look what happened
allowing her to study?!

604
00:57:40,465 --> 00:57:41,329
Look at her now

605
00:57:41,399 --> 00:57:43,959
Promised herself to
some low bred fellow

606
00:57:44,035 --> 00:57:46,367
Enough...full stop
to your education

607
00:57:46,738 --> 00:57:47,796
No, l want to study

608
00:57:47,873 --> 00:57:50,842
Give us your word you won't
have anything to do with Moideen

609
00:57:50,909 --> 00:57:52,604
No, brother, we have decided

610
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:54,042
Are you out to create
trouble in this land?

611
00:57:54,312 --> 00:57:56,803
Do you want to create issues
between Hindus and Muslims?

612
00:57:56,882 --> 00:57:59,043
How can there be an issue?

613
00:57:59,317 --> 00:58:01,285
When Shankar uncle
married a Christian...

614
00:58:01,319 --> 00:58:02,809
...it was father who sheltered him

615
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:05,618
Father always said
there's no caste or religion

616
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,885
That only being human(e) mattered

617
00:58:07,959 --> 00:58:09,950
Father will agree
l am very sure

618
00:58:10,662 --> 00:58:12,527
lnsolent girl!

619
00:58:12,898 --> 00:58:13,990
Sethu

620
00:58:17,235 --> 00:58:20,432
He has used strong
black magic potion on her

621
00:58:20,739 --> 00:58:23,367
lf you allow her to go out
it will be dangerous

622
00:58:23,441 --> 00:58:26,842
Not even her shadow
should be seen outside

623
00:58:35,821 --> 00:58:36,788
Mother

624
00:59:00,545 --> 00:59:02,513
Kunji'ikka?!

625
00:59:03,548 --> 00:59:04,674
l want to go across

626
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:06,808
Hurry please

627
00:59:25,437 --> 00:59:26,597
Manu'ikkaka

628
01:00:17,622 --> 01:00:18,816
Good Lord!

629
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:24,394
l am Moideen of Mukkam

630
01:00:26,898 --> 01:00:29,332
Did you come here at
midnight to give this gift?

631
01:00:30,368 --> 01:00:31,835
This is from my garden

632
01:00:32,804 --> 01:00:34,863
l just had a bite

633
01:00:35,307 --> 01:00:39,300
l heard you were kept
locked up under heavy security

634
01:00:39,477 --> 01:00:41,570
l wanted to bring you out

635
01:00:41,646 --> 01:00:42,806
And here l am

636
01:00:43,481 --> 01:00:44,038
Let's go

637
01:00:44,082 --> 01:00:45,413
Where to?

638
01:00:45,617 --> 01:00:47,812
This bus does not have
a name board for now

639
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,486
Fuel filled to the brim

640
01:00:49,654 --> 01:00:50,916
This bus will go any place...

641
01:00:50,989 --> 01:00:53,480
...where rules of temple
and mosque don't apply

642
01:00:53,558 --> 01:00:54,855
No, Moideen

643
01:00:54,926 --> 01:00:56,484
lt may not matter to you

644
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:58,920
But it will break the friendship
between your father and mine

645
01:00:58,997 --> 01:01:01,329
Neither will we be at peace

646
01:01:01,466 --> 01:01:04,492
And society will blame us
for isolating our families

647
01:01:04,669 --> 01:01:09,800
As a man l have
earned a bad name...

648
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:12,274
...in this short span
of life that l have led

649
01:01:12,477 --> 01:01:15,605
lf taking you away will add
more lustre to my reputation

650
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,908
...then so be it

651
01:01:16,982 --> 01:01:18,882
Stop arguing
and come out now

652
01:01:19,284 --> 01:01:20,649
What about my sisters?

653
01:01:21,353 --> 01:01:24,049
l must not be the reason
for their lives to be ruined

654
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:29,450
Our union must not be the cause
for even a drop of blood being shed

655
01:01:29,928 --> 01:01:31,452
When everyone
decides to accept us-

656
01:01:31,529 --> 01:01:33,292
When both of us are
buried under the earth...

657
01:01:33,365 --> 01:01:34,662
...we can go and graze sheep!

658
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:37,702
Tossing and turning 6 feet deep
love will not be good like it is now

659
01:01:37,936 --> 01:01:40,029
They stopped your studies
because of me

660
01:01:40,505 --> 01:01:41,494
Come away to Kozhikode

661
01:01:41,573 --> 01:01:43,700
l'll stand guard
at the college gate

662
01:01:43,975 --> 01:01:47,706
Let me see which member
of your clan will take you away

663
01:01:48,346 --> 01:01:49,836
l can study from here

664
01:01:50,582 --> 01:01:51,606
Want to be stubborn?

665
01:01:51,883 --> 01:01:53,407
Yes, l am

666
01:02:14,339 --> 01:02:15,897
Are you regretting this?

667
01:02:18,476 --> 01:02:19,807
Did they hurt you?

668
01:02:22,047 --> 01:02:23,036
Did you suffer?

669
01:02:24,482 --> 01:02:25,346
No

670
01:02:27,352 --> 01:02:27,977
Alright

671
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:32,419
l will wait until the day
you decide to come away

672
01:02:33,525 --> 01:02:36,790
The day you agree
l will be here once again

673
01:02:37,562 --> 01:02:40,326
Till then keep writing to me

674
01:02:41,566 --> 01:02:43,557
l will somehow
send you a reply

675
01:02:44,936 --> 01:02:45,960
See you?

676
01:03:04,622 --> 01:03:08,023
Did anyone imagine
she would behave like this?

677
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:09,950
lt's not Kottatil alone

678
01:03:10,028 --> 01:03:12,360
Our entire clan feels let down

679
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:13,454
What a disgrace!

680
01:03:13,531 --> 01:03:15,692
That too with a Muslim boy

681
01:03:20,605 --> 01:03:22,470
What are you doing
out in that rain?

682
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:24,405
Stop it, Appu

683
01:03:35,553 --> 01:03:36,884
Do you remember
all that you studied?

684
01:03:36,955 --> 01:03:38,388
- l do
- You?

685
01:03:38,456 --> 01:03:39,821
l remember

686
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:43,422
- Where are you going?
- To school

687
01:03:43,495 --> 01:03:44,723
No more school
for you, get inside

688
01:03:44,796 --> 01:03:47,993
- We have Hindi exam today
- Hindi...my foot!

689
01:03:48,066 --> 01:03:50,500
Hindi is our national language, uncle

690
01:03:50,568 --> 01:03:51,694
What?!

691
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:53,060
Did you hear that?

692
01:03:53,338 --> 01:03:55,397
Politics at the drop of a hat!

693
01:03:55,473 --> 01:03:57,634
No wonder girls are
going the wrong way

694
01:03:57,709 --> 01:04:01,702
lt's their father's school
He will spoil these girls also

695
01:04:01,779 --> 01:04:03,337
Go inside

696
01:04:04,015 --> 01:04:06,540
Uncle, forget the fact
my education was stopped

697
01:04:06,618 --> 01:04:08,483
Don't punish them
They didn't do anything wrong

698
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:09,815
Don't you open your mouth

699
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:13,289
lf you mend your ways
your sisters can go to school

700
01:04:13,358 --> 01:04:15,758
Otherwise their studies
can go for a toss

701
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:18,693
l don't think my love
for Moideen is a crime

702
01:04:21,966 --> 01:04:24,935
l have made arrangements
for the girls to study

703
01:04:26,604 --> 01:04:28,299
But she is quite stubborn

704
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:30,474
We must get her married

705
01:04:31,342 --> 01:04:33,606
How can we arrange that
all of a sudden?

706
01:04:33,912 --> 01:04:34,901
We must

707
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:39,342
A family that matches our status
will come here on Wednesday

708
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:43,615
Ask your father to come here
as soon as possible from Nilgiris

709
01:04:46,457 --> 01:04:53,625
'Architects of this new generation
will open out coffers of new inspiration'

710
01:04:53,698 --> 01:05:01,503
'Single wick lamps held with affection
come maidens, like poetry in motion'

711
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:06,836
'Single wick lamps held with affection
come maidens, like poetry in motion'

712
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:12,815
'Hail those who awaken to
fresh sounds all around new'

713
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:15,920
How is this song, Moideen,
for the party meeting this evening?

714
01:05:15,987 --> 01:05:17,682
Sure, it will rock

715
01:05:27,498 --> 01:05:30,296
Buy your provisions and wait
l'll be back soon

716
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:37,400
'All of them who perspire
Toiling in fields of green here'

717
01:05:37,575 --> 01:05:38,041
How is this?

718
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:39,537
Wonderful

'Dear Manu'

721
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:46,840
'Once again l am
under new shackles'

722
01:05:46,918 --> 01:05:49,284
'They are planning
to get me married'

723
01:05:49,354 --> 01:05:52,551
'Uncle and brothers seem
to have almost fixed it'

724
01:05:52,724 --> 01:05:54,021
'Something must be done'

725
01:05:54,359 --> 01:05:55,986
'lnstead of going to
another prison...'

726
01:05:56,361 --> 01:05:57,692
'...isn't death a better option?'

727
01:05:57,762 --> 01:06:01,755
'Those who made the handcuffs
and built the prisons, let them tremble'

728

'Let us show our courage, insurge
break the fortress walls to surge'

729
01:06:24,289 --> 01:06:28,385
'Let this be a new dawn of crimson
on the blue skies of a revolution'

'We will break
the walls of your fortress'

735
01:06:44,876 --> 01:06:47,037
'l was expecting this
for quite some time'

736
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:49,703
'According to my spies...'

737
01:06:50,481 --> 01:06:53,814
'...it's a family from Perumanna
who will reach Kottatil on Wednesday'

738
01:06:54,285 --> 01:06:55,980
'To 'see' you as
a prospective bride'

739
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:57,919
'They are very affluent'

'Astrologer Marthandam
has specified the time'

743
01:07:04,829 --> 01:07:06,990
'Wednesday morning at 8:30'

744
01:07:14,839 --> 01:07:17,000
'Look! They've arrived'

745
01:07:23,681 --> 01:07:25,512
'He is Rarukutty
of Madathiparambil'

746
01:07:25,683 --> 01:07:27,275
'Your future father-in-law'

747
01:07:27,652 --> 01:07:30,712
'Half the town of Perumanna
is under his control'

748
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:35,624
'That handsome fellow
is M.P Manoharan'

to Madras after marriage'

753
01:07:51,342 --> 01:07:52,434
Let's go in

754
01:07:53,945 --> 01:07:55,845
'There's a knock
at your door, right?'

755
01:07:56,013 --> 01:07:57,446
'Go, open it'

756
01:07:58,816 --> 01:08:00,681
'Go and open the door'

757
01:08:06,758 --> 01:08:08,419
What were you doing?

758
01:08:08,693 --> 01:08:09,523
They are here

759
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:10,922

'You must dress well
because that is tradition'

762
01:08:21,572 --> 01:08:22,504
Here www.TamilRockers.com,

01:08:26,778 --> 01:08:27,972
'Now close the door'

764
01:08:29,247 --> 01:08:31,875
'Now l will tell you
how to present yourself'

765
01:08:40,725 --> 01:08:43,853
lt's not easy to come away
from the Nilgiris tile factory

766
01:08:43,928 --> 01:08:45,691
That's why her father is not here

767
01:08:45,763 --> 01:08:46,821
That's alright

768
01:08:46,898 --> 01:08:48,490
There's always a next time

769
01:08:48,866 --> 01:08:51,630
My dear Kanchana

770
01:08:52,003 --> 01:08:53,334
You are taking so long

771
01:08:53,404 --> 01:08:54,837
Come out

772
01:08:56,741 --> 01:08:59,437
Kanchana, open the door

773
01:09:02,447 --> 01:09:04,915
Open the door, my girl

774
01:09:23,601 --> 01:09:26,764
Have you gone mad?
What is all this?

775
01:09:27,004 --> 01:09:28,528
l am Moideen's girl

776
01:09:28,606 --> 01:09:31,871

a second marriage, l'm ready

Give it to me

778
01:09:35,513 --> 01:09:36,002
Move aside

779
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:39,010
Dear Goddess!
What is she up to?

780
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:50,658
Who is this?

781
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:51,717
l am Kanchanamala

782
01:09:51,796 --> 01:09:54,492
You are here to 'see' me
as prospective bride, right?

783
01:10:00,538 --> 01:10:03,598
My son is not so desperate
to marry a widow

784
01:10:04,375 --> 01:10:06,866
You were also
a part of this charade?

785
01:10:06,944 --> 01:10:09,777
l swear upon Lord Muthappan
l didn't know she was a widow

786
01:10:09,881 --> 01:10:11,610
What are you sitting
and gaping there?

787
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:13,042
Get up

788
01:10:13,684 --> 01:10:14,480
Rarutty

789
01:10:14,519 --> 01:10:16,419
Without knowing the facts-
Explain this to him

790
01:10:16,721 --> 01:10:18,416
l don't want any explanations

791
01:10:18,489 --> 01:10:21,049
He won't look for an alliance
anywhere near Mukkam

792
01:10:22,894 --> 01:10:24,020
You wicked girl!

793
01:10:27,899 --> 01:10:29,867
After putting us
through this shame...

794
01:10:30,034 --> 01:10:32,400
...you really think you have
a future with him?

795
01:10:32,637 --> 01:10:34,935
Even if you die inside here...

796
01:10:35,373 --> 01:10:37,034
...you won't get
what you desire

797
01:10:38,409 --> 01:10:40,741
lf you dare disgrace our family...

798
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:42,537
...l will kill you

799
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:18,042
Stop right there, woman

800
01:11:21,886 --> 01:11:23,376
Give it to me

801
01:11:31,596 --> 01:11:33,291
This is our 2nd glass of tea

802
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:36,489
Will it come at least
before the next tea?

803
01:11:37,468 --> 01:11:38,332
Will it come?

804
01:11:39,503 --> 01:11:41,494
Manu'ikkaka, are you having tea?

805
01:11:41,706 --> 01:11:43,298
No, it's poison

806
01:11:43,474 --> 01:11:44,907
Do you also want some?

807
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:48,869
Moideen!

808
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:53,614
l am from Kottaatil

809
01:11:53,784 --> 01:11:54,773
Only l will come hereafter

810
01:11:54,919 --> 01:11:56,352
Here is the credit book

811
01:11:58,990 --> 01:12:02,289
'All these hurdles
did not deter them'

812
01:12:03,728 --> 01:12:09,291
'Despite the distance
their love only grew stronger'

813
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:15,567
'When letters were intercepted
they found new ways to communicate'

814
01:12:25,282 --> 01:12:27,546
Not enough sunlight
Put it over there

815
01:12:54,311 --> 01:12:57,610
lf your uncle and brothers
come to know, they will kill me

816
01:12:57,748 --> 01:12:58,908
But l'm fine with it

817
01:12:58,949 --> 01:13:01,941
l know how much
you love each other

818
01:13:03,454 --> 01:13:05,012
My only regret

819
01:13:05,389 --> 01:13:09,689
To see a girl like you
full of life to be shut inside here

820
01:13:20,504 --> 01:13:22,028
'My dear Kanchanakutty'

821
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:26,672
'l have found a new method
to solve our letter problem'

'May be even to Delhi'

To Trivandrum

832
01:14:06,751 --> 01:14:07,775

Why did you stop?

863
01:15:51,822 --> 01:15:52,914
Goodness!

864
01:15:57,494 --> 01:15:59,052
You and your Socialism

865
01:16:02,299 --> 01:16:02,890
Run

866
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,426
Why did you stop, you rascal?

867
01:16:04,568 --> 01:16:06,297
What 'old man' am l?

868
01:16:06,804 --> 01:16:07,964
Move

869
01:16:09,807 --> 01:16:11,741
You think you can
let your tongue run wild?

870
01:16:12,309 --> 01:16:13,435
What did l do that was so absurd?

871
01:16:13,577 --> 01:16:15,010
Didn't you-

872
01:16:15,713 --> 01:16:20,514
Didn't you detour road from
the bus stand to the river front?

873
01:16:20,851 --> 01:16:23,513
Otherwise the Govt. would have acquired
the land belonging to Thotungal

874
01:16:23,587 --> 01:16:26,920
Must the poor townsfolk make
a detour of almost a kilometer now?

875
01:16:28,559 --> 01:16:31,323
l too have lent my shoulder
to bring Mukkam up to this level

876
01:16:31,595 --> 01:16:32,755
Sometimes l'm forced to
take such decisions

877
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:33,888
How does it affect you?

878
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:38,663
People supported me because
of the good l did for this town

879
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:41,500
l will continue to be
the Sultan of Mukkam

880
01:16:41,572 --> 01:16:44,905
You can be Sultan or Satan!

881
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:49,469
But it is natural in any democracy
for new candidates to emerge

882
01:16:49,513 --> 01:16:52,277
And no Unni Moideen can stop that

883
01:16:52,416 --> 01:16:53,815
Are you teaching me democracy?

884
01:16:54,418 --> 01:16:56,978
You were the one who published news
about trees being chopped down

885
01:16:57,321 --> 01:16:58,413
And put a spoke in
my development plans

886
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:00,957
Those trees were not
planted by you, father

887
01:17:01,025 --> 01:17:02,686
When the hot sun

Do you think he understood?

1071
01:29:02,379 --> 01:29:03,971
Whether he did or not
is besides the point

1072
01:29:04,247 --> 01:29:07,910
The whole town understood
this was a dig at Kottatil family

1073
01:29:07,984 --> 01:29:10,919
- l'll take this route
- See you tomorrow

No, you carry on

with that kerchief over your face, Sethu?

1080

This will only cause trouble

1083
01:31:34,297 --> 01:31:39,599
l will consider this shot as just
a lapse on your part, Sethu

1084
01:31:40,537 --> 01:31:43,529
Let this remain with me
for the time being

As much as she loves me

1088

Even if the whole world
is against us...

1091
01:32:14,537 --> 01:32:16,334
...Sethu will understand

1092
01:32:17,707 --> 01:32:19,265
But l was wrong

1093
01:32:20,276 --> 01:32:21,265
l was...

No, mother

you have a future with him?

Everyone has happily
settled down in their lives

1177
01:46:07,389 --> 01:46:13,089
Shouldn't we start
a life of our own now?

Tomorrow l am asking her
to come away with me

l won't allow you

...l will marry only her

And we will lead
a life together too

After our families
fixed the alliance

1212
01:50:56,077 --> 01:50:57,635
But you, son of Satan...

1213
01:50:57,679 --> 01:51:01,206
...if you are bent on raising hell
on this land by living with her

1214
01:51:01,282 --> 01:51:02,681
...you will be dead

1215

Are you sure?

1218
01:51:11,559 --> 01:51:14,187
As sure as you are my father

1219

my word once for all

l am not prepared
for anything else

1234
01:54:15,109 --> 01:54:16,303
No, Manu

1235
01:54:16,577 --> 01:54:17,805
You cannot die

1236
01:54:18,112 --> 01:54:22,481
l won't allow any God
to take you away from me

1237
01:54:24,085 --> 01:54:25,677
l want my Manu

1238
01:54:28,790 --> 01:54:30,223
l won't kill myself

1239
01:54:30,825 --> 01:54:35,159
Waiting for you all these years
will become meaningless then

1240
01:54:36,397 --> 01:54:39,093
What l should experience
in a lifetime...

1241
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:41,566
...l have gone through
in this room

1242
01:54:42,370 --> 01:54:46,534
Yet l have never
prayed to any God

1243
01:54:47,308 --> 01:54:50,402
But today l am praying

1244
01:54:51,446 --> 01:54:53,141
My dear Gods...

1245
01:54:54,148 --> 01:54:56,343
...give me back my Moideen

1246
01:54:56,851 --> 01:54:58,716
Promise me
You'll give him back

1247
01:54:59,554 --> 01:55:01,488
l must see my Manu

1248
01:55:01,656 --> 01:55:04,625
Didn't l tell you
l can't allow you in there?

1249
01:55:04,692 --> 01:55:07,354
We are trying our best
to save your son's life

1250
01:55:07,428 --> 01:55:08,725
This will be his life saver

1251
01:55:08,796 --> 01:55:11,094
lt will work better
than any of your medicines

1252
01:55:11,199 --> 01:55:13,224
l'll just give it to him
and l will come away

1253
01:55:18,272 --> 01:55:19,170
Don't delay

1254
01:55:19,273 --> 01:55:20,399
See who the donor is

1255
01:55:20,441 --> 01:55:21,533
Okay, doctor

1256
01:56:12,059 --> 01:56:13,526
Take me to the court and-

1257
01:56:13,594 --> 01:56:16,620
Didn't l ask you
to take a bail-

1258
01:56:16,797 --> 01:56:18,162
l am the accused

1259
01:56:18,366 --> 01:56:19,799
You must produce me in court

1260
01:56:20,167 --> 01:56:22,397
No one will come to bail me out

1261
01:56:30,545 --> 01:56:32,672
Unni Moideen?
Give that over there

1262
01:56:35,816 --> 01:56:37,044
Give me that form

1263
01:56:37,785 --> 01:56:40,618
Sign here
Go ahead

1264
01:56:44,458 --> 01:56:47,757
Here Unni
Now sign

1265
01:58:22,556 --> 01:58:23,716
Where are you off to?

1266
01:58:24,492 --> 01:58:26,016
Wherever l feel like

1267
01:58:26,694 --> 01:58:31,256
The joy on your face when you ruin
people whom you dislike...?!

1268
01:58:31,332 --> 01:58:33,197
God will reward you accordingly!

1269
01:58:33,668 --> 01:58:35,659
Stop blabbering and go inside

1270
01:58:35,736 --> 01:58:37,203
That will be better for you

1271
01:58:37,271 --> 01:58:39,398
l am getting to know
what is better for me

1272
01:58:40,241 --> 01:58:44,644
After chopping him up like meat
you sit and enjoy a game alone, eh?

1273
01:58:45,312 --> 01:58:49,749
You tried to kill him because
you knew he was a better man, eh?

1274
01:58:50,184 --> 01:58:52,652
Your power and position
is more important to you

1275
01:58:52,753 --> 01:58:53,811
Yes, woman

1276
01:58:54,088 --> 01:58:55,578
Dignity and self respect
are priority for a man

1277
01:58:55,656 --> 01:58:57,055
Utter rubbish!

1278
01:58:57,291 --> 01:59:00,226
A congress man who preached
there was no caste and religion

1279
01:59:00,294 --> 01:59:02,728
But when your own son wanted
to marry Madhavan's daughter...

1280
01:59:02,797 --> 01:59:04,492
...you simply eliminated him

1281
01:59:04,598 --> 01:59:07,226
l have more dignity and
self respect than you

1282
01:59:07,601 --> 01:59:11,332
So look, this is all
l am taking with me

1283
01:59:11,405 --> 01:59:15,398
And that too, to implore God
to give you better sense

1284
01:59:19,280 --> 01:59:21,612
Never come here again

1285
01:59:22,016 --> 01:59:22,539
Get lost

1286
01:59:22,616 --> 01:59:25,141
l don't even want to come
into this Satan's house again

1287
01:59:25,219 --> 01:59:27,710
You can live here all alone
as the Sultan of Mukkam

1288
01:59:27,788 --> 01:59:31,554
But one day
God will reform you

1289
01:59:50,811 --> 01:59:52,438
Even when he was on
the verge of dying...

1290
01:59:52,513 --> 01:59:54,140
...he was clutching
that fistful of sand

1291
01:59:54,215 --> 01:59:56,183
l tried so much
to prise it off his hand

1292
01:59:56,250 --> 01:59:58,275
That is the sand of
Kanchana's footprint

1293
01:59:58,385 --> 01:59:59,579
How will he let go?

1294
02:00:07,828 --> 02:00:10,490
Moideen, doctor has
agreed for your discharge

1295
02:00:10,765 --> 02:00:12,198
You can leave this afternoon

1296
02:00:12,299 --> 02:00:14,267
l never thought
you would recover so quickly

1297
02:00:15,035 --> 02:00:18,095
lt wasn't the doctor
or his medicines

1298
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:24,043
lt was her prayers day and night
that retained your soul here

1299
02:00:24,612 --> 02:00:27,342
You must give that soul back to her

1300
02:00:28,649 --> 02:00:30,617
What are you waiting for now?

1301
02:00:30,684 --> 02:00:32,151
Just go and bring her

1302
02:00:32,219 --> 02:00:35,017
l also have a house of my own

1303
02:00:35,356 --> 02:00:36,118
True

1304
02:00:36,190 --> 02:00:37,657
This is the best time

1305
02:00:37,758 --> 02:00:40,158
All her siblings are married

1306
02:00:40,327 --> 02:00:42,192
Ramachandran is in Coimbatore

1307
02:00:42,263 --> 02:00:44,458
Go and bring her Manu'ikkaka

1308
02:00:45,733 --> 02:00:49,533
Mother, if l believe in you
and bring her with me...

1309
02:00:49,703 --> 02:00:51,466
...you think we will end up starving?

1310
02:00:51,639 --> 02:00:53,038
Be quiet!

1311
02:00:53,107 --> 02:00:56,770
Go bring her
Then you can joke

1312
02:01:16,463 --> 02:01:17,657
Here, take it

1313
02:01:22,636 --> 02:01:25,070
- ls someone to be hanged?
- Didn't you hear?

1314
02:01:25,239 --> 02:01:27,264
Naxalite Ajitha has been set free

1315
02:01:40,087 --> 02:01:41,349
Sultan

1316
02:01:41,722 --> 02:01:43,451
lf you tell the truth
to the magistrate...

1317
02:01:43,524 --> 02:01:44,718
...we'll lose our case

1318
02:01:44,792 --> 02:01:46,419
You did not stab him

1319
02:01:47,361 --> 02:01:50,421
lf you can save the case by
your gift of the gab, do it

1320
02:01:50,798 --> 02:01:53,096
But l will not bow my head
in front of that scoundrel

1321
02:01:53,367 --> 02:01:55,335
Kannur jail is meant
for red blooded men

1322
02:02:08,749 --> 02:02:11,616
Known to people
as Sultan of Mukkam...

1323
02:02:11,685 --> 02:02:16,054
...the accused here, Baliyambra
Pottatu Unni Moideen Sahib

1324
02:02:16,257 --> 02:02:20,057
That is, my client
B.P.Moideen's father

1325
02:02:20,394 --> 02:02:24,160
Haven't you tried many times
to kill my client Moideen?

1326
02:02:25,266 --> 02:02:26,756
Yes, you have
Many times

1327
02:02:27,568 --> 02:02:32,164
Once following a disagreement
haven't you tried to shoot him?

1328
02:02:37,678 --> 02:02:42,706
l am trying to establish the enmity
the accused always had towards my client

1329
02:02:46,720 --> 02:02:48,153
Tell me

1330
02:02:48,222 --> 02:02:54,593
Did you not point a hunting gun
and try to kill your son?

1331
02:02:56,697 --> 02:02:58,130
l did point a gun

1332
02:03:00,467 --> 02:03:02,230
But l did not shoot

1333
02:03:04,171 --> 02:03:06,605
Didn't you challenge
you would chop him...

1334
02:03:06,674 --> 02:03:10,405
...that too, in public
at Mukkam junction?

1335
02:03:12,513 --> 02:03:15,346
This has no relevance to this case

1336
02:03:20,287 --> 02:03:24,053
Tell me, didn't you threaten
in public you would kill him?

1337
02:03:25,192 --> 02:03:27,387
Any respectable person
holding a high position in society...

1338
02:03:27,461 --> 02:03:31,056
...if insulted publicly
will definitely react

1339
02:03:31,332 --> 02:03:33,197
lt was not a threat

1340
02:03:33,267 --> 02:03:37,465
So you admit you were not
on the best of terms with your son

1341
02:03:41,842 --> 02:03:45,710
Wasn't it on July 12th, during
heavy rains, you were stabbed?

1342
02:03:45,779 --> 02:03:46,837
Yes

1343
02:03:47,114 --> 02:03:49,412
You could have died, isn't it?

1344
02:03:51,385 --> 02:03:53,114
lt was sheer luck
l did not die

1345
02:03:53,187 --> 02:03:56,281
The first stab itself and
my intestines were injured

1346
02:03:59,793 --> 02:04:01,727
lt was sheer luck
this young man...

1347
02:04:01,795 --> 02:04:04,127
...was rescued from
his own father's attack

1348
02:04:04,431 --> 02:04:06,558
He was operated for 6 hours

1349
02:04:06,834 --> 02:04:08,802
And had to stay in
hospital for 1 month

1350
02:04:09,303 --> 02:04:12,238
l am submitting medical records
to the court for your kind perusal

1351
02:04:23,484 --> 02:04:25,076
Whose knife is this?

1352
02:04:27,755 --> 02:04:29,222
My father's

1353
02:04:30,591 --> 02:04:34,186
This knife is always tucked
in Unni Moideen Sahib's waist

1354
02:04:34,428 --> 02:04:36,055
And he has a gun in his car

1355
02:04:38,499 --> 02:04:41,059
Wasn't it with this knife
the accused stabbed you?

1356
02:04:43,070 --> 02:04:44,560
lt is true l was hurt

1357
02:04:44,671 --> 02:04:45,763
But not...

1358
02:04:45,839 --> 02:04:47,534
...with a knife

1359
02:04:51,545 --> 02:04:54,378
lt was Unni Moideen Sahib
who stabbed you

1360
02:04:55,382 --> 02:04:57,077
No one stabbed me

1361
02:05:00,854 --> 02:05:03,254
Moideen, this is the court

1362
02:05:03,323 --> 02:05:05,154
Think back properly and reply

1363
02:05:05,225 --> 02:05:07,659
This knife was used
by Sahib to stab you

1364
02:05:07,728 --> 02:05:09,855
l tell you l wasn't stabbed

1365
02:05:11,098 --> 02:05:14,090
Then how did you get hurt?

1366
02:05:14,168 --> 02:05:15,465
lt was...

1367
02:05:15,602 --> 02:05:19,094
lt was raining
heavily on July 12th

1368
02:05:19,473 --> 02:05:22,704
l got out of the river front and
l was walking along the road

1369
02:05:23,110 --> 02:05:26,443
l slipped in a pool of water
and fell sideways

1370
02:05:26,547 --> 02:05:29,607
l fell right on top
of the stub of a tree

1371
02:05:29,817 --> 02:05:31,478
lt was as sharp as a knife

1372
02:05:31,585 --> 02:05:33,519
l tried to get up thrice

1373
02:05:33,587 --> 02:05:38,183
But the 3rd time also, my hand slipped
and l sank into unconsciousness

1374
02:05:38,425 --> 02:05:41,758
When l became conscious
l was lying in Beach hospital

1375
02:05:42,362 --> 02:05:45,331
That was exactly
what happened that day

1376
02:06:20,267 --> 02:06:21,234
Forget it, father

1377
02:06:22,703 --> 02:06:24,102
lt's alright

1378
02:06:30,811 --> 02:06:34,372
Since prosecution could not
prove the accused was guilty...

1379
02:06:34,448 --> 02:06:39,283
...court grants unconditional
release to Unni Moideen Sahib

1380
02:07:49,656 --> 02:07:50,645
Come

1381
02:07:50,724 --> 02:07:52,351
We can sit inside

1382
02:07:53,627 --> 02:07:56,596

02:09:39,132 --> 02:09:41,362
My husband will come and
we'll have to leave tomorrow

1407
02:09:41,435 --> 02:09:42,663
Why don't you take them?

1408
02:09:42,736 --> 02:09:46,194
Sethu, take them for the movie

1409
02:09:47,240 --> 02:09:48,673
Okay then, get ready

1410
02:09:50,677 --> 02:09:52,508
Kanchana aunty...'Lisa'

1411
02:09:55,382 --> 02:09:58,146
Everyone is going
for the movie 'Lisa'

1412
02:09:58,352 --> 02:10:00,217
The kids want you also
to go with them

1413
02:10:00,287 --> 02:10:01,652
l'm not going anywhere

1414
02:10:02,356 --> 02:10:04,654
They are here as our guests

1415
02:10:05,058 --> 02:10:07,652
Don't stay back
and spoil their joy

1416
02:10:07,728 --> 02:10:10,128
Everyone is concerned only
about their own happiness

1417
02:10:10,197 --> 02:10:11,994
Sethu uncle promised to take us

1418
02:10:12,065 --> 02:10:13,498
You also come

1419
02:10:13,767 --> 02:10:16,634
For the sake of the child
Go with them please

1420
02:10:16,703 --> 02:10:20,036
lf you stay shut inside
like this, your heart will wither

1421
02:10:20,107 --> 02:10:21,233
Are you going?

1422
02:10:21,408 --> 02:10:24,070
l am expecting a call
from Coimbatore, l can't go

1423
02:10:34,755 --> 02:10:37,121
Are you afraid
to watch 'Lisa'?

1424
02:10:39,226 --> 02:10:40,352
No...you?

1425
02:10:40,427 --> 02:10:43,260
No, because l will
be sitting next to you

1426
02:10:53,039 --> 02:10:55,234
Sethu uncle
Let's sit there

1427
02:11:00,247 --> 02:11:01,771
'Haven't we met before?'

1428
02:11:02,182 --> 02:11:03,149
'Of course not'

1429
02:11:03,183 --> 02:11:04,377
'Why do you say like this?'

1430
02:11:04,584 --> 02:11:06,108
'Let go of me'

1431
02:11:18,265 --> 02:11:21,257
Are you Shaji
the roadside Romeo?

1432
02:11:36,216 --> 02:11:37,376
Manu'ikkaka!

1433
02:11:37,451 --> 02:11:38,543
Move aside

1434
02:11:59,139 --> 02:12:00,800
Who stopped the film?

1435
02:12:02,108 --> 02:12:04,042
(Coded message)

1436
02:12:05,212 --> 02:12:06,440
What language is this?

1437
02:12:06,513 --> 02:12:08,242
'My dear Kanchanakutty'

1438
02:12:08,415 --> 02:12:10,144
'l am here'

1439
02:12:10,383 --> 02:12:13,216
'With your theatre as witness...'

1440
02:12:13,253 --> 02:12:15,778
'...l bestow on you
a thousand kisses'

1441
02:12:16,156 --> 02:12:18,454
'l saw Sethu sitting there'

1442
02:12:18,658 --> 02:12:22,321
'This is the only way to
make him budge from there'

1443
02:12:39,346 --> 02:12:40,836
Where is Moideen?

1444
02:12:42,482 --> 02:12:44,143
Kanchanakutty

1445
02:12:44,784 --> 02:12:47,378
Manu! How did you come here?

1446
02:12:47,721 --> 02:12:50,451
God! l can at least see you

1447
02:12:50,524 --> 02:12:52,515
Are you alright?

1448
02:12:52,592 --> 02:12:55,390
We can discuss all that later

1449
02:12:55,462 --> 02:12:57,487
Sethu is somewhere around

1450
02:12:57,564 --> 02:13:02,661
l will come with my car
at 2:00 a.m to your house

1451
02:13:02,869 --> 02:13:05,463
- You should come away
- l will come

1452
02:13:05,639 --> 02:13:07,334
How will l know you've come?

1453
02:13:08,408 --> 02:13:12,242
l will blink the headlights twice

1454
02:13:12,312 --> 02:13:16,078
And then to confirm, once more

1455
02:13:18,752 --> 02:13:19,776
Sethu'etta is back

1456
02:13:20,754 --> 02:13:21,721
l am going

1457
02:13:21,788 --> 02:13:22,652
Don't forget

1458
02:13:22,756 --> 02:13:24,246
2:00 a.m

1459
02:14:57,283 --> 02:14:59,683
My owner's son has passed away

1460
02:15:45,298 --> 02:15:47,425
Kottatil Ramachandran is no more

1461
02:15:47,500 --> 02:15:48,660
Wasn't he living in Coimbatore?

1462
02:15:48,735 --> 02:15:50,396
Yes, he died there

1463
02:15:50,470 --> 02:15:54,668
''Created just for me, oh woman''

1464
02:15:54,741 --> 02:15:59,678
Sir...?
He's gone!

1465
02:16:00,580 --> 02:16:03,743
- What is it?
- Ramachandran died in Coimbatore

1466
02:16:03,817 --> 02:16:08,083
''Created just for me, oh woman''

1467
02:16:08,321 --> 02:16:10,255
What happened to
my son Ramachandran?

1468
02:16:10,323 --> 02:16:11,290
Father

1469
02:16:11,357 --> 02:16:12,483
Oh God!
My son

1470
02:16:12,559 --> 02:16:13,583
Father!

1471
02:16:13,660 --> 02:16:22,227
''You share my soul 50-50
You are the essence that fills me''

1472
02:16:22,535 --> 02:16:26,767
''You are the light within me shining
A pearl necklace shimmering''

1473
02:16:27,040 --> 02:16:29,668
'Fate played the role
of a villain once again...'

1474
02:16:29,743 --> 02:16:32,405
'...in Moideen's and Kanchana's lives'

1475
02:16:32,479 --> 02:16:36,142
'Just when they decided
to live together...'

1476
02:16:36,216 --> 02:16:40,118
'...Kanchana's elder brother
Ramachandran dies'

1477
02:16:41,187 --> 02:16:47,490
'His death was a big blow
to the Kottatil homestead itself'

1478
02:16:51,331 --> 02:16:53,128
What is your plan in life?

1479
02:16:53,333 --> 02:16:56,063
ls it enough if you
work day and night?

1480
02:16:56,136 --> 02:16:58,434
By the time you realize
your life has passed by...

1481
02:16:58,505 --> 02:17:00,063
...it will be too late

1482
02:17:00,140 --> 02:17:01,471
What do you mean,
brother-in-law?

1483
02:17:01,508 --> 02:17:04,306
Get married
Raise a family

1484
02:17:04,377 --> 02:17:06,402
lt's quite late as it is

1485
02:17:06,746 --> 02:17:08,611
Before that, Kanchana must
settle down in life

1486
02:17:08,681 --> 02:17:10,342
After that l'll decide what to do

1487
02:17:10,683 --> 02:17:12,446
What can you do
about Kanchana?

1488
02:17:12,519 --> 02:17:15,113
l've never seen a more
arrogant woman in this world

1489
02:17:15,188 --> 02:17:18,555
After marrying your sister
l've always been humiliated

1490
02:17:18,625 --> 02:17:20,388
But now l have
become thick skinned

1491
02:17:20,460 --> 02:17:22,394
l'll tell you frankly

1492
02:17:22,662 --> 02:17:24,129
Your father is old and feeble

1493
02:17:24,197 --> 02:17:26,028
Everybody else has
gone their own way

1494
02:17:26,099 --> 02:17:28,590
You'll end up shouldering
all the liabilities

1495
02:17:28,668 --> 02:17:31,432
l am aware of all this
But what can l do?

1496
02:17:31,638 --> 02:17:35,096
l have loved her the most
among all my sisters

1497
02:17:35,175 --> 02:17:37,735
Every time she was
reprimanded and beaten...

1498
02:17:38,044 --> 02:17:41,343
...l was in pain and bleeding inside

1499
02:17:41,714 --> 02:17:45,775
l haven't slept peacefully
all these years

1500
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:51,456
Whatever happens l'll wait
until she's settled in life

1501
02:17:51,691 --> 02:17:54,159
She is ready to elope
with that Muslim boy

1502
02:17:54,360 --> 02:17:56,385
Do you think any decent family
will come forward with a proposal?

1503
02:17:56,462 --> 02:17:59,363
Look out for a handicapped
groom or a widower

1504
02:17:59,499 --> 02:18:00,830
l have said whatever
l wanted to say

1505
02:18:01,100 --> 02:18:02,397
Now it's up to you

1506
02:18:02,502 --> 02:18:03,298
l'm leaving

1507
02:18:03,336 --> 02:18:04,701
See you, Latha

1508
02:18:33,099 --> 02:18:36,068
Kanchana doesn't deserve
any random stranger

1509
02:18:38,338 --> 02:18:41,535
lf you don't have any objection
l will marry her

1510
02:19:07,667 --> 02:19:09,726
Why do we have to 'see'
our own niece formally?

1511
02:19:10,303 --> 02:19:12,635
Just sticking to tradition, that's all

1512
02:19:13,172 --> 02:19:14,002
True

1513
02:19:30,556 --> 02:19:33,650
l want to speak to Kanchana

1514
02:19:48,374 --> 02:19:51,172
Frankly l never expected
to see you like this

1515
02:19:51,344 --> 02:19:53,642
Dressed up
in all this finery

1516
02:19:54,480 --> 02:19:56,710
Because usually you don't

1517
02:19:57,784 --> 02:20:01,618
You come dressed like a widow
to chase away prospective grooms

1518
02:20:03,122 --> 02:20:05,181
Today l decided
l'll come like this

1519
02:20:07,727 --> 02:20:11,060
Time is like an exam, isn't it?

1520
02:20:13,499 --> 02:20:14,488
True

1521
02:20:17,370 --> 02:20:19,668
From childhood and
all through my growing years...

1522
02:20:20,139 --> 02:20:22,300
...my thoughts were only of you

1523
02:20:22,742 --> 02:20:25,643
l thought you had noticed

1524
02:20:27,046 --> 02:20:28,070
No, Appu'etta

1525
02:20:28,614 --> 02:20:31,276
l knew only the day
you gave me that letter

1526
02:20:35,388 --> 02:20:39,722
l have preserved from our school days
a peacock feather you gave me

1527
02:20:40,259 --> 02:20:45,322
Your photo and a notebook
with your hand writing

1528
02:20:46,432 --> 02:20:52,029
Maybe l was not capable
of expressing my feelings

1529
02:20:53,406 --> 02:20:55,397
By the time l got around
to professing my love...

1530
02:20:56,142 --> 02:20:58,610
...Moideen was already
deep rooted in your heart

1531
02:20:59,212 --> 02:21:01,680
But l expected at least
a reply for my letter

1532
02:21:03,449 --> 02:21:06,646
l gave that letter to Moideen
on that day itself

1533
02:21:12,425 --> 02:21:15,360
Anyway past is past

1534
02:21:16,396 --> 02:21:19,365
Being a bachelor all these years
and waiting for you...

1535
02:21:19,699 --> 02:21:20,996
...was worth the while, right?

1536
02:21:23,036 --> 02:21:24,765
My thoughts are full of another man

1537
02:21:25,171 --> 02:21:27,571
For the past 10-20 years

1538
02:21:29,142 --> 02:21:30,734
Still you are so keen
on marrying me

1539
02:21:31,477 --> 02:21:34,207
Do you like me
so much, Appu'etta?

1540
02:21:35,081 --> 02:21:38,608
l did not come here with
any thoughts of sacrifice

1541
02:21:39,652 --> 02:21:42,621
They will never let you
marry Moideen

1542
02:21:43,256 --> 02:21:46,282
To see you waste away
your life like this...

1543
02:21:46,726 --> 02:21:49,126
...my conscience does not
allow me, Kanchana

1544
02:21:50,029 --> 02:21:54,489
l love you more than
anything else in this world

1545
02:21:54,567 --> 02:21:56,091
l know it, Appu'etta

1546
02:21:57,103 --> 02:22:01,267
But l love my Moideen
a thousand times more

1547
02:22:02,608 --> 02:22:05,805
And Moideen loves me
ten thousand times more

1548
02:22:06,512 --> 02:22:08,104
lf you insist on this marriage...

1549
02:22:08,648 --> 02:22:11,116
...you'll tie the knot
to my dead body

1550
02:22:13,352 --> 02:22:17,288
Even if l have to go through hell
for another 1000 years and die...

1551
02:22:17,356 --> 02:22:19,221
...l'll happily do so for Moideen

1552
02:22:20,693 --> 02:22:23,719
All these years l have
lived in this hell hole...

1553
02:22:24,464 --> 02:22:28,730
...thinking only of him
and reading his letters

1554
02:22:30,136 --> 02:22:33,833
Do you think you can
tear our hearts apart?

1555
02:22:34,107 --> 02:22:37,736
Tell me, can anybody
in this world be able to?

1556
02:22:44,517 --> 02:22:47,850
There cannot exist another
woman like you in this world

1557
02:22:48,087 --> 02:22:49,816
You are Moideen's wife

1558
02:22:51,491 --> 02:22:55,222
One day the world will
acknowledge your love

1559
02:22:55,795 --> 02:22:57,160
l swear

1560
02:23:04,203 --> 02:23:05,227
Forgive me

1561
02:23:06,172 --> 02:23:07,605
For my covetousness...

1562
02:23:07,673 --> 02:23:09,265
...forgive me

1563
02:23:56,155 --> 02:23:57,247
You?

1564
02:23:57,657 --> 02:23:59,090
What's this?

1565
02:23:59,258 --> 02:24:01,226
You are completely drenched

1566
02:24:02,295 --> 02:24:03,728
l just felt like it

1567
02:24:05,198 --> 02:24:08,258
lt's been quite some time
since you walked in here

1568
02:24:08,334 --> 02:24:10,632
- What happened?
- Just like that

1569
02:25:03,422 --> 02:25:05,686
'Yours only, Kanchana'

1570
02:25:27,213 --> 02:25:28,441
Moideen, come

1571
02:25:30,683 --> 02:25:32,082
He is not crying

1572
02:25:32,184 --> 02:25:33,515
Smart boy!

1573
02:25:34,153 --> 02:25:35,620
Sit, let me take a picture

1574
02:25:36,122 --> 02:25:37,384
Come, sit closer

1575
02:25:39,759 --> 02:25:41,317
Wait
One more

1576
02:25:46,666 --> 02:25:48,429
Remove those black bangles

1577
02:25:57,510 --> 02:25:58,841
l'll be upstairs

1578
02:26:09,488 --> 02:26:13,356
Did Bhasi see you in this new disguise
on this auspicious day?

1579
02:26:13,492 --> 02:26:14,481
No

1580
02:26:15,594 --> 02:26:17,619
lt was Appu'etta
who informed me

1581
02:26:17,697 --> 02:26:21,098
No one recognized me
in worker's clothes

1582
02:26:23,035 --> 02:26:27,233
Don't you have to go in person
to get one's passport, Moideen?

1583
02:26:27,406 --> 02:26:29,067
The rule says so

1584
02:26:29,141 --> 02:26:32,736
But my friend Jamal works
in the passport office

1585
02:26:32,812 --> 02:26:34,575
He has managed to get it

1586
02:26:34,747 --> 02:26:38,205
Your signature on
the application is enough

1587
02:26:38,284 --> 02:26:40,752
l can go get both our passports

1588
02:26:44,557 --> 02:26:48,687
But after waiting
for so many years...

1589
02:26:50,663 --> 02:26:53,496
...a pity we can't live
in our own soil

1590
02:26:56,469 --> 02:26:58,460
Not because it's impossible

1591
02:26:59,205 --> 02:27:03,437
The doors of Balyambra house
are open for you and me

1592
02:27:03,576 --> 02:27:08,377
My mother is waiting to see me
bring you holding your hand

1593
02:27:09,482 --> 02:27:12,713
But that does not
get us anywhere

1594
02:27:13,018 --> 02:27:15,418
You also have your family and relatives

1595
02:27:16,155 --> 02:27:19,716
lssues will arise when
we live within their vicinity

1596
02:27:20,626 --> 02:27:28,328
Maybe, there will be an uproar
among our communities initially

1597
02:27:28,701 --> 02:27:32,262
But all are human after all

1598
02:27:33,472 --> 02:27:34,404
They tend to forget

1599
02:27:34,473 --> 02:27:37,374
But so far away...?

1600
02:27:37,576 --> 02:27:39,043
So what, my dear?

1601
02:27:40,045 --> 02:27:42,275
Whether it is America or Mukkam

1602
02:27:43,249 --> 02:27:44,807
...you and l will
always be together

1603
02:27:48,454 --> 02:27:52,481
We'll apply for a visa
the day we get our passports

1604
02:27:54,093 --> 02:27:58,496
The day we get our visa
we'll leave this place

1605
02:28:00,065 --> 02:28:02,329
Our friend Eenashu is in New York

1606
02:28:02,535 --> 02:28:05,333
He has arranged a job for me

1607
02:28:06,472 --> 02:28:10,067
l have with me a fistful
of sand from your foot print

1608
02:28:12,144 --> 02:28:14,044
To take with me when l go

1609
02:28:15,181 --> 02:28:16,113
Until you come...

1610
02:28:16,182 --> 02:28:18,013
...that will hold me in good stead

1611
02:28:21,587 --> 02:28:23,646
''The Lord is the light,
lucent sunrise''

1612
02:28:24,023 --> 02:28:26,184
''The Lord shows us
the way, the path''

1613
02:28:26,258 --> 02:28:28,488
''He is the ultimate ascetic,
Pure and mystic''

1614
02:28:28,561 --> 02:28:30,722
''He is the only actuality,
The ultimate truth''

1615
02:28:30,796 --> 02:28:33,128
''The Lord is the light,
lucent sunrise''

1616
02:28:33,199 --> 02:28:35,030
''The Lord shows us
the way, the path''

1617
02:28:35,434 --> 02:28:37,629
''He is the ultimate ascetic,
Pure and mystic''

1618
02:28:37,670 --> 02:28:39,604
''He is the only actuality,
The ultimate truth''

1619
02:28:51,717 --> 02:28:53,275
Jamal?

1620
02:28:53,586 --> 02:28:55,053
Mani'ikkaka

1621
02:28:55,154 --> 02:28:56,314
Give me

1622
02:28:57,790 --> 02:29:00,452
l have got it done
without any problem

1623
02:29:00,493 --> 02:29:02,085
Here it is

1624
02:29:28,454 --> 02:29:31,014
Mukkam junction
Get down

1625
02:29:34,059 --> 02:29:35,458
Get in...get in

1626
02:29:38,230 --> 02:29:39,697
To Kozhikode

1627
02:29:40,432 --> 02:29:42,127
Go...go...go

1628
02:29:42,768 --> 02:29:44,167
Right...right

1629
02:30:03,689 --> 02:30:07,090
Get off quickly

1630
02:30:07,159 --> 02:30:09,491
The ferry is due now

1631
02:30:09,562 --> 02:30:11,462
Careful, doctor

1632
02:30:11,630 --> 02:30:13,655
Come closer

1633
02:30:20,239 --> 02:30:22,730
Manu'ikkaka, l see
you got your passport

1634
02:30:23,208 --> 02:30:25,005
- Yes
- What next?

1635
02:30:25,077 --> 02:30:29,138
l'll tell you when we meet
at the club this evening

1636
02:30:32,651 --> 02:30:34,175
Manu'ikkaka, there are
too many people

1637
02:30:34,253 --> 02:30:35,220
What to do?

1638
02:30:35,287 --> 02:30:37,721
lf l wait any longer
it may rain, get in

1639
02:30:39,558 --> 02:30:40,650
Move aside

1640
02:30:42,595 --> 02:30:43,789
Sit here

1641
02:31:06,085 --> 02:31:07,575
What's in your pocket?

1642
02:31:08,754 --> 02:31:11,086
Ayurvedic concoction
for back-pain

1643
02:31:11,357 --> 02:31:12,415
Teacher, did you know?

1644
02:31:12,491 --> 02:31:14,220
Manu'ikkaka is going abroad

1645
02:31:14,293 --> 02:31:15,760
ls that so, Manu'ikkaka?

1646
02:31:42,021 --> 02:31:44,114
Son, back from school, eh?

1647
02:31:44,223 --> 02:31:46,282
No, he is coming
back from the market

1648
02:32:17,623 --> 02:32:20,751
Strong winds...may be a heavy shower

1649
02:32:41,547 --> 02:32:42,844
Sit...sit

1650
02:32:46,351 --> 02:32:48,285
My dear, sit
Hold tight

1651
02:32:48,353 --> 02:32:49,615
Breeze is really strong

1652
02:33:26,592 --> 02:33:27,490
Don't panic

1653
02:33:27,559 --> 02:33:28,491
Just sit all of you

1654
02:33:28,560 --> 02:33:30,255
Don't stand

1655
02:33:30,429 --> 02:33:31,453
Don't shout and panic

1656
02:33:31,530 --> 02:33:32,622
Just sit

1657
02:33:33,265 --> 02:33:35,199
Go back to the banks

1658
02:33:35,267 --> 02:33:36,757
Go to the river bank, man

1659
02:33:36,835 --> 02:33:38,234
Just be quiet

1660
02:33:38,337 --> 02:33:40,168
Don't open that umbrella

1661
02:33:40,239 --> 02:33:42,139
lt will catch the wind

1662
02:33:44,810 --> 02:33:46,437
Shut up

1663
02:33:51,416 --> 02:33:52,474
Don't be scared

1664
02:33:52,551 --> 02:33:53,677
Don't lean that side

1665
02:33:53,819 --> 02:33:55,286
Hold here

1666
02:34:11,637 --> 02:34:12,729
Don't be scared

1667
02:34:12,805 --> 02:34:14,568
Hold tight
Don't move

1668
02:34:15,107 --> 02:34:16,699
Steer towards the bank

1669
02:34:17,176 --> 02:34:18,643
Kunji'kka, move towards the bank

1670
02:34:18,710 --> 02:34:21,304
Be calm...don't get flustered

1671
02:34:23,048 --> 02:34:24,743
Please don't stand
The boat will topple

1672
02:34:25,551 --> 02:34:28,145
Doctor, sit down
Boat will capsize

1673
02:35:19,738 --> 02:35:22,229
Jump right there

1674
02:35:28,413 --> 02:35:29,744
Look...jump in

1675
02:35:55,240 --> 02:35:56,332
Come, Moideen

1676
02:35:56,842 --> 02:35:57,809
Take them away

1677
02:35:58,076 --> 02:35:59,441
Get them into the boat

1678
02:36:31,143 --> 02:36:32,405
Hold him

1679
02:36:32,678 --> 02:36:35,146
Moideen, come
Climb in

1680
02:36:42,054 --> 02:36:43,817
Just get them into the boat

1681
02:38:03,468 --> 02:38:04,799
More people are down there

1682
02:38:13,578 --> 02:38:16,138
Enough, come

1683
02:38:16,214 --> 02:38:17,238
Hold it

1684
02:38:20,152 --> 02:38:22,484
Don't wait for me
Just rescue them

1685
02:38:22,554 --> 02:38:24,044
l'll be alright

1686
02:38:39,404 --> 02:38:42,066
My dear

1687
02:38:47,179 --> 02:38:48,646
Moideen, enough

1688
02:39:16,508 --> 02:39:18,203
Moideen!

1689
02:40:14,166 --> 02:40:16,600
My Moideen alone is missing!

1690
02:40:55,273 --> 02:40:57,241
'Boat capsizes in Mukkam
Moideen and 3 others die'

1691
02:40:57,309 --> 02:40:59,743
'His hazel eye was plucked by a fish'

1692
02:41:00,045 --> 02:41:02,206
l want to go to my Manu

1693
02:41:02,314 --> 02:41:03,440
Let me go

1694
02:41:03,515 --> 02:41:04,504
Manu

1695
02:41:07,319 --> 02:41:11,050
- What are you doing?
- Leave me

1696
02:41:11,556 --> 02:41:13,023
Don't do something danger-

1697
02:41:13,091 --> 02:41:14,319
l want to go

1698
02:41:15,994 --> 02:41:16,653
My dear

1699
02:41:16,728 --> 02:41:21,131
'The lruvazhinjipuzha disaster snatched
Moideen from Kanchana forever'

1700
02:41:21,366 --> 02:41:24,733
'Kanchana waiting eagerly
to unite with Moideen...'

1701
02:41:25,237 --> 02:41:27,432
'...was told this earth shattering
news of his demise'

1702
02:41:28,406 --> 02:41:30,397
'ln a world without Moideen...'

1703
02:41:30,475 --> 02:41:33,137
'...not wanting to live'

1704
02:41:33,245 --> 02:41:35,145
'...she attempted suicide'

1705
02:41:45,156 --> 02:41:49,559
'Wasn't it water from lruvazhinji river
that Moideen last drank?'

1706
02:41:49,661 --> 02:41:53,620
'She too wished to
drink the same water'

1707
02:42:22,661 --> 02:42:27,758
'Kanchana intended to end
her life drinking that water'

1708
02:42:27,832 --> 02:42:29,322
My dear

1709
02:42:36,574 --> 02:42:37,768
Mother

1710
02:42:50,655 --> 02:42:52,646
Were you intending
to die for him?

1711
02:42:54,426 --> 02:42:56,485
You must live for him, right?

1712
02:42:58,229 --> 02:43:01,096
Come, we'll go to my house

1713
02:43:01,766 --> 02:43:03,495
As my daughter-in-law

1714
02:43:03,668 --> 02:43:04,760
Come

1715
02:43:44,376 --> 02:43:45,900
Come

1716
02:44:34,793 --> 02:44:43,792
''Created just for me, oh woman
One born on the soil of Mukkam''

...Kanchana lives as Moideen's
unmarried widow even today

1721
02:45:03,855 --> 02:45:05,823
With fond memories of Moideen

1722
02:45:07,459 --> 02:45:11,361
''The essence of love in me
You are a splendor unseen''

1723

''You are the novel woman of my novel''
