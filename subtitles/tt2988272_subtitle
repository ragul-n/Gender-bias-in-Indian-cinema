1
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,322
Love? It comes in handy.
Who's denying it?

2
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,660
But it's something that's between
two people

3
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,027
So why does it concern the others?

4
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:56,826
Look at him ogling at her

5
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:02,837
He has one purpose after all.
Right?

6
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:05,339
So he has to stare

7
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:09,279
Girls give boys the once-over
in their own way, too

8
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:15,309
They have desires, too. All kinds

9
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:20,184
But here,
if a couple even talk to each other...

10
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:24,393
...the living and the dead make it
their business and pounce

11
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,432
And what's the bottom line?

12
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,095
Marriage!

13
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,627
You'll commit, right?

14
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,033
Marriage is the glucose drip,
a cure-all

15
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:40,944
Don't think too much. Settle down

16
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:44,677
All of India wants everyone settled

17
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:49,816
Yet in 60 years, we haven't managed
a settlement with our neighbour

18
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,748
I'm in a new relationship.
It suits me

19
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:59,059
But marriage and commitment?
Another ballgame

20
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:00,728
I mean...

21
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:05,335
Another ballgame altogether

22
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,655
Free as a bird

23
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,323
Free as a spirit

24
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:37,630
At times serene, at times searching

25
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,328
Love her today

26
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:40,928
Love another tomorrow

27
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,441
This shameless heart of mine
will give me a bad name

28
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,135
O playful heart

29
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,008
So random

30
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,173
Fooled me, stirred me

31
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,782
Fooled me

32
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,351
Swept me off my feet

33
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,379
My playful heart flies to you

34
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,885
Clasp this sinner's
heartstrings gently

35
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,860
Tangled are the ways of the heart

36
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:47,336
Untangling them is sheer worry

37
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,636
Many are tired from trying

38
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,734
The heart's mysteries elude all

39
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,110
They try to unpick its mysteries

40
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,674
But hide what they discover

41
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:30,111
Goyal Caterers & Decoraters

42
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,476
We plan weddings.
Prepare the best catering

43
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:45,728
Not The country of the brave!
Play My mate's wedding

44
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,820
Or I'll whack you between the ears

45
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,924
You play! But you can't?
Smoking all day

46
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,231
When others play,
you bring their morale down

47
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:56,364
Shut up! You low life

48
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:57,237
Mr Know-All!

49
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,867
My music is ear-ache.
Your farting is sweet music

50
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,175
All the wedding guests are fake
But still they want a real band

51
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,809
- An arranged marriage?
- I thought he'd go for love

52
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,247
Wonder what changed his mind

53
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,154
To each his own, brother

54
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:17,388
A man may look modern but
when the call of tradition beckons...

55
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,588
Put it inside. Hurry!

56
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,231
He looks uneasy. What's up?

57
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,165
Who knows? The fool

58
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:27,466
At least try to look real
even if you are fake wedding guests

59
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,972
Come on, wear your jacket

60
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,606
See, Rag h u ram?

61
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:36,672
I've hired four wedding guests,
suited-booted

62
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:39,882
Your magnificent groom's party,
Raghuram

63
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,919
Don't call me Raghuram

64
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,249
Just Raghu. That's all

65
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:48,190
Give me a break.
Just for today, please

66
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,063
- You promised a deluxe package
- So?

67
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,324
You should've hired
8 English-speaking guys

68
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,734
But you got two. Not even one girl

69
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,897
What will my in-laws think?

70
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,969
For 4 years I've worn my best suits,
playing your wedding extra

71
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,272
Anyone complained?

72
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:11,213
Why no English-speaking girl
to boost my image?

73
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:15,514
I'd pass her off as an ex

74
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,147
What's that?

75
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:28,322
Miss Gayatri!
You may attend A-grade weddings...

76
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:32,029
...but she goes to super-grade ones
in her flowing skirts

77
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,965
When they hear her speak English...

78
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:38,008
...they'll be stunned, Raghuram

79
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:42,971
- No Raghuram in front of her
- Look at her!

80
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:47,177
The atmosphere will turn English soon

81
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,087
Nothing confirmed

82
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,025
Goel Saab, no discount

83
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,696
He's family. My boy

84
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:05,834
Give him a discount

85
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,964
He'll do the same for you,
and bring his Mrs...

86
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,268
...for free

87
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:13,003
A small favour for your brother?

88
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,546
What brother? Don't know him

89
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:21,847
You pay her. A sister's rate

90
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:25,014
Only 4000. 2 days, one full night

91
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,287
A sister's rate? 4000?
2 days, one full night

92
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:29,485
Oh! What did you...

93
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,961
I didn't mean...

94
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:35,294
Wasting my time. Nothing is fixed

95
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:36,492
So why call me?

96
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,866
Embarrassing for him and for me

97
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,536
No discount

98
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,169
Pay her a thousand.
I'll deduct a thousand

99
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:47,100
Load up the groom's party. Go!

100
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,246
It's settled? A thousand for her

101
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:53,749
You must've fobbed me off
with an old mare as well

102
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,979
Go, see!
The mare is right outside

103
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:59,615
Dolled up like seven Katrina Kaifs

104
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,556
I know all about your Katrina Kaifs

105
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,554
Explained them the routine?

106
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:10,099
Hop on! Tell them what you want
on the way

107
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:13,102
Leave the rest to me

108
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,503
Marry with a free mind. I'm here!

109
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:46,468
Don't bother. You and brother adjust

110
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,084
All set?

111
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:05,678
0k, good night

112
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,803
Can I listen to my MP3?

113
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,761
What's that?

114
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:51,400
Dance Masti 2012

115
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,768
Are you married?

116
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,103
What's it to you?

117
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:06,274
To me? Nothing.
My marriage is all settled

118
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:07,647
Get some sleep.

119
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:11,719
Tomorrow you'll be up all day,
all night

120
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,222
I know

121
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:17,053
Marriage isn't a simple matter.
Do it and it's done

122
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,064
Do it and it's done?

123
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,499
That's how everyone marries

124
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,702
What if you don't want to?

125
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,463
Meaning?

126
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:33,375
What if you have doubts?

127
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:35,907
N ow?

128
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,010
Sitting in your wedding bus?

129
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,315
Doubt can pop up anytime

130
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,389
Arranged marriages aren't easy.

131
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,261
Can one really adjust?

132
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:04,371
Your sense of humour may not match.
Or your hobbies and habits

133
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,674
Or your sex life...

134
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:09,808
I get it

135
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,444
So you get it?

136
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,355
Am I making a mistake?

137
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,591
You know? A mistake

138
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,763
I know what the word means

139
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,595
Didn't you think it through?

140
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,265
I did

141
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:35,430
So why say yes?

142
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,906
I said nothing. She did

143
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,135
So?

144
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,074
I agreed

145
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:41,167
So get married

146
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,111
Sure! We're just chatting

147
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,486
It's ok. Last minute nervousness.

148
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,919
Sleep!

149
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,161
Can't sleep

150
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,331
Me neither, thanks to you

151
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,009
Not a great boyfriend

152
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,211
A fool with unstoppable hands

153
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:23,878
A real beast

154
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:28,449
The other guy was better

155
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,059
He called me often

156
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,856
Smiled when he saw me. Funny guy

157
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,728
So no problem?

158
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:39,292
He was a clown.
Who wants to marry Charlie Chaplin?

159
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,705
Want a cigarette?

160
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:45,336
No. Never touch them

161
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:46,635
May I?

162
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:50,605
Sure. But sit by the window

163
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,944
When did you start?

164
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,617
Two years ago

165
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,257
How come?

166
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,421
Thanks to my boyfriend

167
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,559
Who? Charlie Chaplin?

168
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,859
The guy before

169
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,125
Unstoppable hands?

170
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:10,957
No, someone else

171
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,594
I see. What happened to him?

172
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:16,168
You're inquisitive

173
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,237
Are you marrying me?

174
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:27,177
Sure...you're all right?

175
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,114
We're so compatible

176
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,224
You listen to item songs. I never do

177
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,327
You smoke. I never touch cigarettes

178
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:40,660
You talk a lot. I'm awkward

179
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,995
You have qualities I don't.
And vice-versa

180
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:44,658
What else could anyone want?

181
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:53,476
Trying your luck a last time
before your wedding, sir?

182
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:03,649
Don't trust me. But trust my name.
A godly name

183
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:19,896
I need my bag...

184
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,110
I'll sit over there

185
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:38,477
Better

186
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,565
A cigarette please?

187
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:15,745
I got attracted when he spoke
about a sister's rate

188
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,279
He didn't mean it that way

189
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:22,951
But one must play it safe

190
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:27,926
He was getting married,
unsure of his choice of girl

191
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,568
That's India for you. No love.
No romance, nothing

192
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:35,466
Say yes to marriage.
Work it out later

193
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:40,368
Has it worked for anyone?
So why would it work for me?

194
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:46,040
I see many weddings.
All sorts marrying all sorts

195
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:49,146
Weddings are to show off
pomp and finery

196
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,944
But marriage?

197
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:55,758
It shows up the lies
and double standards of Indians

198
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,626
Greetings!

199
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,169
Welcome to our humble home!

200
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:09,968
No formality. We've only come
from nearby Jaipur

201
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,166
Tell me where's the gents toilet?

202
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:15,143
A common toilet. But for VIPs

203
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,878
No! We're in-laws now.
Life is all about adjusting

204
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,951
Where's the bridegroom?

205
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,984
Call him!

206
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:44,633
What's up?

207
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,775
She's the groom's sister

208
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,615
I'll be right back

209
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,085
A cool cat!

210
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,987
I'll take care of her

211
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,820
No son, she is a special guest.
I'll take care of her

212
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,520
Look after the groom's friends

213
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:08,189
Go and call aunty.
Let her see all this.

214
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,093
Who looks after the groom's mates?

215
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,466
Or we can look after ourselves

216
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,501
Take care of them

217
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,509
At your service

218
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,943
Welcome to our home!

219
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:35,386
Sister is so obliging.
No fuss, no demands

220
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:38,660
- I can tell she's your sister
- What sister?

221
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:41,323
Your elder sister.
No, your younger sister...

222
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,333
I like girls like her

223
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:52,407
- You're most kind
- Don't embarrass me

224
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,334
Do tell her...

225
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,745
...to ask if she needs anything

226
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,944
The villain in him is resurfacing

227
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:08,253
Your sister-in-law is here.
Take care of him

228
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,951
The gift money?

229
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,085
Your gift money is ready

230
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,839
Welcome!

231
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,928
Ask the bride to lift her veil

232
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:53,064
Would you lift your veil?

233
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:02,675
- Wow!
- He'd never find her through love

234
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:06,539
The lucky fool wins a beauty

235
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:11,346
I hear she's an orphan.
They're probably getting rid of her

236
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,769
My pants are slipping down

237
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,346
May we talk in private?

238
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,787
Everything will be private from now on

239
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:48,791
Garland him!

240
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:00,800
I need the bathroom. May I?

241
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,473
Hurry, son

242
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:09,167
You won't get a minute's peace later.

243
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:10,841
Go!

244
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,310
I'll show you the way

245
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:15,482
I know the way

246
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,853
Be quick! Go!

247
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:08,828
Do not blame...

248
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:14,440
the impulsive innocent heart

249
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:20,246
If the heart speaks in a true voice

250
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:23,750
Just about everyone in the world
would be exposed

251
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,187
He's decamped. He ran away

252
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,916
Who ran?

253
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:36,589
I'm ready to take Tara's hand

254
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,433
Get lost! Idiot!

255
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,920
Can I get a cold drink?

256
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,843
A cold drink!

257
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:29,549
- Offer the clients a soda
- You want me to go bankrupt?

258
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,985
- How many sodas have you had?
- Same number of clients I've got you

259
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,951
I'll sell him a dozen veils

260
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,285
You'll go to hell

261
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,228
You'll be first. Send for me

262
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:17,694
Bless you, son

263
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:21,260
Bless him. I'll collect my 50 rupees

264
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:25,240
- Bless you, brother
- No, the foreigner

265
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,439
Bless you, brother

266
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:39,113
Anything else? Jaipuri shoes?

267
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:42,123
- I'll bring his wife later
- You sure?

268
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:45,161
- Don't you trust me?
- Trust him?

269
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,687
- You crazy?
- Why not?

270
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:50,528
You trust a man who bolts
from his wedding?

271
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,691
Meaning?

272
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,202
What's it to you?

273
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,670
Mind your shop

274
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,070
You ran from your wedding?

275
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:00,304
Did I rob you?

276
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,751
Charge 1000. 800's mine.
Don't make me hit you

277
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:19,922
What brings you here?

278
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:21,530
Is this what you do?

279
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:26,032
Goel forces me to play
the groom's guest

280
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:32,841
Want a coffee?

281
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:35,806
Come on

282
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:39,278
- I want to talk to you
- What about?

283
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:40,883
Explain things

284
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,680
- Explain what?
- About what happened

285
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:47,480
No need. It's your life.
Do as you please. Do I care?

286
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:52,226
I ran away from my wedding.
So why are you cross?

287
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:54,425
I'm not cross. I'm fine

288
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,328
So what's the problem in a coffee?

289
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,959
No problem

290
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:02,233
Coffee and gulaab jumun are
a great combination

291
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:04,069
A great combination?

292
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,370
Sure. If you give it a shot

293
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:10,775
Listen. I'll have coffee with you
for one reason

294
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:13,338
To know what sort of man you are

295
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:18,013
In your wedding bus, then bolting
...yuck!

296
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,180
Yuck?

297
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:22,258
And you? And all your boyfriends?

298
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:25,022
You won't lose your virginity
by drinking coffee

299
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:27,928
Talk elsewhere

300
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,123
Depraved people!

301
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:32,862
You pious double-standard man

302
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,227
Downloading on the sly.

303
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:36,567
And you talk!

304
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,076
I don't want any

305
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:43,578
Give it here

306
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,848
Well?

307
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,321
Why did you run?

308
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:02,156
You know

309
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:04,665
Me? How would I know?

310
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,200
You wouldn't ask, if you didn't

311
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,875
- Try one
- Why did you run?

312
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:22,674
When I agreed to marry,
I didn't know I'd meet a girl...

313
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:27,580
...like you. I saw Tara,
thought it might work

314
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,184
All of India marries like that

315
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:34,024
Why did you run?

316
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:37,799
Why? Because you kissed me

317
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:38,629
I did?

318
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:39,531
It wasn't me

319
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,764
I was listening to music

320
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:46,331
If you meet a one-in-a-million girl
who you could fight the world for...

321
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:51,380
Suddenly she's next to you.
Wouldn't you even talk to her?

322
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,848
All that? In one glance?

323
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:02,289
A first glance is all it takes.
Or you never hit it off

324
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,257
Are you done?

325
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:10,127
You're making a mistake

326
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:11,265
Why?

327
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:13,666
I proved I have guts

328
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,099
If I had married Tara,
I'd make her unhappy

329
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,072
I'd be thinking of you

330
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,075
She'd be unhappy, so would I

331
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,201
So would you

332
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:25,676
I'm happy. You're imagining things

333
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:30,617
Sure! Then why haven't you
even sipped your coffee?

334
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:38,857
There's something between us

335
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:42,031
Attraction, whatever. It's there

336
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:45,731
You know it but can ignore it

337
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:51,832
- Stay with unstoppable hands
- And you have no hands?

338
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:57,640
Pass it here

339
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:07,646
I've had affairs. No big secret.

340
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:11,687
But I'm fed up of how you boys behave

341
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:15,754
And love? Cooked it,
tasted it, done with it

342
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,692
Why waste my time?

343
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:21,233
You're confused.
What'll you do with me?

344
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,874
A mistake

345
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:29,375
If I walked you home,
you'd have time to think it over

346
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,154
Take me home

347
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,516
I'll pay tomorrow

348
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:50,329
I don't want to be your friend
or brother

349
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:55,231
It's simple.
I'm attracted to you. Very Much

350
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,803
Beyond control

351
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,708
So don't tell me: Let's be friends

352
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,912
Maybe you can be friends,
but I can't

353
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,207
- Boyfriend has two words
- Starting with boy

354
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:18,488
Come here

355
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:24,731
Sit

356
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,065
Will you kiss me?

357
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:36,173
Forever

358
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:37,474
Now

359
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,261
How fast?

360
00:30:58,122 --> 00:30:59,795
About 100, 150

361
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:04,001
That's what happens
when I feel for someone

362
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:05,601
But boys?

363
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:07,438
They just get aroused

364
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:08,875
I'm not like that

365
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,275
How can I tell?

366
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:20,947
Tell me something about you.
Then I'll tell you about me

367
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,252
I don't want to

368
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:23,289
Say something

369
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,019
I said I don't want to

370
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:33,796
Well?

371
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:23,584
Open your eyes

372
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:34,490
You live here alone? Your parents?

373
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:39,729
Just thought of them?

374
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:44,839
I asked last night.
You changed the subject

375
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:49,471
- Will you make tea or the bed?
- As you say

376
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:54,715
Go! Buy me some cigarettes

377
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:18,333
Papa lives in Guwahati,
works for Indian Oil.

378
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:20,901
Mummy passed away

379
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,307
- As for me...
- I know

380
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:27,014
What brought you here?

381
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:28,807
I came to Kota...

382
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:32,047
...to train as an English teacher

383
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:35,747
I teach. And Mr Goel gives me work

384
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:38,954
No work in Guwahati then?

385
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,923
Don't like lectures.

386
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:43,522
Do this, don't do that.
It's good here

387
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:48,765
I'm used to living alone.
Don't know about family life

388
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,010
It's nice

389
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:02,145
How's your pulse?

390
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,317
Beating. Do you eat eggs?

391
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,020
Shall I make them?

392
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:14,022
If it's only for today, then I will

393
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,164
Your turn, then mine

394
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:20,761
Waking up here every day?

395
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:25,868
Yes. What will I do at home?

396
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,841
Slow down

397
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:40,118
- I have work today
- Who is stopping you?

398
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:45,757
Shall I come back? With some things?

399
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,194
Not slowing down?

400
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:00,069
You're dangerous

401
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,443
No work today?

402
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:13,749
I took a chance

403
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:19,355
His confident approach took
my breath away, by God

404
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:24,030
He's so romantic. Imagine him
trapped in marriage?

405
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:28,928
Hejilted his bride, dumped her
in front of everyone

406
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:31,000
Frankly, I didn't like that

407
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:36,275
Maybe he's right. Would she be happy?

408
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:41,312
She's a beauty. Took guts to leave her

409
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,181
You know a man's true colours
when he won't accept a lie

410
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:49,725
That impressed me the most

411
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,894
He isn't two-faced

412
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:56,695
Honest, truthful, straightforward

413
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:00,629
Tell me something

414
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:08,038
What kind of girl is Gayatri?

415
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,604
Why?

416
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,540
Why do you need a character
certificate?

417
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:17,678
She's nice

418
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:21,484
She smokes but has a good heart

419
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:24,592
She isn't for you

420
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,326
Go near her and you'll get
a tight slap.

421
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:28,796
You'll see stars

422
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:33,666
I hear she's had many boyfriends

423
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:36,631
Why so nosey?

424
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,970
You refusing to issue her a passport?

425
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:40,269
No reason

426
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:46,606
It's all below the belt for men

427
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:50,942
You're not thinking straight

428
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:55,687
You ended your marriage 2 weeks ago.
Your eyes roving again?

429
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,353
It's the tourist season. Focus on work

430
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:00,623
What kind of girl is she...

431
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:08,568
She had a problem last year.
She got pregnant

432
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:14,305
My daughter's friends at the medical
college helped her out

433
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,705
She had a boyfriend for a few years.

434
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,608
A Delhi guy

435
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:24,042
Gayatri threw him out

436
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,214
Why?

437
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:30,390
Do I know? I'm not her father

438
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:33,259
She needed an advance.

439
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,196
The wife said: Give it. So I did

440
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,159
I'm no expert in girls' matters

441
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,569
Why do you ask? Focus on work

442
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,465
What's it to me?

443
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:44,195
All right then

444
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:45,700
All right

445
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:01,550
Mr Goel, the class is over.
Can I come by?

446
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:07,991
Please pay me cash.
I'll return your cheque later

447
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,368
No, I'm not laughing at you

448
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:17,838
My brother is here and
my expenses have doubled

449
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:24,236
Tell your brother to share expenses.

450
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,104
If not, why have a brother?

451
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:29,984
Forget it! Tell me how's business?

452
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:33,653
Not many weddings.

453
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:38,016
So I stage fake ones
to amuse the tourists

454
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:43,396
You could come and floor them
with big English words

455
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:47,736
I want to ask you something

456
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,574
What's his name? The runner?

457
00:38:58,803 --> 00:38:59,941
Yes, Raghuram.

458
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:02,413
What kind of guy is he?

459
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:03,911
Why?

460
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,549
Why do you need a character
certificate?

461
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:10,554
- No reason. He's a fool
- That he is

462
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:13,629
Keep the cigarette down.
You'll die soon if you keep smoking

463
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:17,623
Why so curious about him?

464
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,135
You refusing to issue him a passport?

465
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:21,829
No reason

466
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,501
Listen, child. It's youth talking

467
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:30,702
You aren't thinking straight

468
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,507
Only a year since your problem...

469
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:35,444
...your mind is wandering

470
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:37,846
What kind of guy is he?

471
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:41,818
Just curious.
Seeing you reminded me of him

472
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:43,723
He's a clown, by God

473
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,687
Does he come here?

474
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:52,199
Not now. Not till the wedding season

475
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:59,197
Even the best folk get muddled
when it comes to marriage

476
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:04,644
Boys are all the same today.
Eat, drink and be merry!

477
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:08,643
Is he like that?

478
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,845
Do I know? I'm not his father

479
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,383
He came looking for work

480
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,524
The wife said: Hire him. So I did

481
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:21,964
I'm no expert in boys' matters.
Forget him

482
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,629
What's it to me?

483
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:25,925
All right then

484
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,093
All right

485
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,315
Listen, stay in your own home

486
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,750
What's wrong?

487
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,344
You should stay there

488
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:48,516
I've cleared out of my room

489
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:52,987
Now what?

490
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:57,098
Let me stay a few days

491
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,526
- I'll look for another room
- Fine

492
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:08,109
Where do I put my things?

493
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,610
Why did you run away?

494
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,141
I told you why

495
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:15,478
Why say yes at all?

496
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:17,044
I told you

497
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:20,246
What makes you tick?
Is it all eat, drink and be merry?

498
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:23,253
I'm not a professional marriage bolter

499
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:28,289
I've never been serious about anyone

500
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,862
Think carefully about
what you're doing

501
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:34,292
Never been serious before?

502
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:35,904
No

503
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,097
Never?

504
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:39,533
What about...

505
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:42,037
No, nothing

506
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,838
What do you mean?

507
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:47,306
You want a beer?

508
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,314
Your treat?

509
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:55,423
Yes. Let's go out

510
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,221
Any problem with staying in?

511
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:06,832
What's wrong?

512
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:08,699
Just empty words

513
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:10,067
That's what I feel

514
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,802
Want to get married, too?

515
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:17,473
Your mind? You packed that away.
Big talk!

516
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:20,882
Just be happy with what we have

517
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:27,622
I've said it now

518
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:32,119
Sure!

519
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:35,992
Put your suitcase away

520
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:42,265
- Sit on my lap first
- No

521
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,132
Just once?

522
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:51,076
- I won't move the suitcase
- Do I care?

523
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:57,912
Close your eyes

524
00:42:58,776 --> 00:42:59,880
Why?

525
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,865
I didn't ask you to lie down

526
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:14,862
Let's forget the beer

527
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:27,209
Who are you visiting?

528
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:31,779
My sister

529
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:33,280
Who is your sister?

530
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:36,414
Where can I buy cigarettes?

531
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:38,819
The smoker's brother?

532
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:44,292
Excellent! It's over there

533
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:51,400
- What did he say?
- Who?

534
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:53,197
<i>Who'? Gupta?</i>

535
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:54,537
The man you were chatting to

536
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:57,076
We weren't chatting.
I bumped into him

537
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:59,041
Look where you're going then

538
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,347
Don't stand on the balcony then

539
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:06,611
- What did he say?
- He asked who I was visiting

540
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:09,414
- And?
- I said my sister

541
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:13,758
- You're shameless!
- What else could I say?

542
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:16,955
I'm the live-in boyfriend.
I ran from my wedding to you

543
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:19,392
- Shameless!
- What should I have said?

544
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,566
We'll have to say that to everyone

545
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:23,764
Everyone?

546
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:27,703
Don't I have a landlord? A cleaner?
A milkman? Is this a hotel?

547
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:30,078
0k, that's what we'll say

548
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:34,348
- How about breakfast?
- Your turn

549
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:37,950
- Sunday is my day off
- When was that decided?

550
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:41,819
- No one works on Sunday
- Neither do I

551
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:45,158
Let's go to a movie

552
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:47,687
OK, brother

553
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:48,622
Yes, sister

554
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,790
Move it!

555
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,187
Hey listen!

556
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:25,155
Listen to what I have to say

557
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:30,636
Don't have any grand illusions

558
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:34,768
If your say rules the day

559
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:37,275
My say will rule the night

560
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:42,481
Think it over now.
So don't ask me later

561
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:45,452
What's this thing between us?

562
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:50,988
What's this thing between us?

563
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,353
A sheet!

564
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:58,366
A homespun sheet woven
with silken desires

565
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:09,871
It's coming to flower, finally,
my love life is set to fly

566
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:15,345
It's coming to flower, finally,
my quirky love life

567
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:48,943
If anything is hidden between us

568
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:54,412
If a dark night casts over a sunny day

569
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:59,984
If anything comes between us

570
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:05,390
If victory is spiked with defeat

571
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:10,632
Softly will I ask to share your troubles

572
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:15,673
Softly will I discover your every desire

573
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:21,307
Desires unchained, stubborn
bubbles floating free

574
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:32,722
It's coming to flower, finally,
my love life is set to fly

575
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:38,592
It's coming to flower, finally,
my quirky love life

576
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,692
No change. I'll pay you next time

577
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:16,669
Where do you stay?

578
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:17,865
At his sister's

579
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,607
The smoker's brother

580
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:24,039
Last time...

581
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:28,375
I'll take the change tomorrow

582
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:31,976
Give it to him now. Who knows?
He may be gone tomorrow

583
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:34,281
I'm here only...

584
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,153
I was friends with the last guy

585
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:38,818
He didn't last long

586
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:41,285
Things turned serious

587
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:44,996
Her father rushed here from Guwahati

588
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:48,125
Then took the next train back

589
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,803
You're my father...

590
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:52,735
But don't try running my life

591
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:57,736
Guwahati is miles away. So, enjoy!

592
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:03,549
He's the permanent pain

593
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,978
You carry on

594
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:15,159
Easy! What's the hurry?

595
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,330
I'm not going anywhere

596
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,494
Slowly

597
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:24,767
I'm not going anywhere

598
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:48,194
Do you visit Guwahati often?

599
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,661
There's a direct train

600
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:55,531
Yes. So?

601
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,434
No reason

602
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:02,608
You're pretty serious about me

603
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:05,874
Can't I even ask?

604
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:11,143
I told you I was serious

605
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:19,385
But you're not the serious type

606
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,157
Why?

607
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:30,595
You said you weren't serious
about anyone

608
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:51,154
ls something on your mind?

609
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:54,895
Go on. Ask me

610
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,657
So you won't need to spy on me

611
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:00,060
I was only...

612
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:14,743
Don't waste water

613
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:20,152
Any Pickles?

614
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,884
Or yoghurt?

615
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,250
What shall we eat with the parathas?

616
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:30,324
Go home

617
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:33,558
Go on. Leave!

618
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:35,462
What's wrong?

619
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:36,964
Nothing. I'm done

620
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:39,532
What is it?

621
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,773
I only asked for yoghurt.
What's the big deal?

622
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:44,073
I'm done.

623
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,672
Don't want to make
another mistake

624
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:50,946
What is it? What did I say wrong?

625
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,777
- Tell me
- It's nothing

626
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:58,356
You said: You can be friends,
but I can't

627
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:00,859
Don't you trust me?

628
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:07,234
What's the point in trusting?

629
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:11,067
I trust you, so trust me

630
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:27,914
You could never trust me.
You can only talk

631
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:56,409
The truth?

632
00:52:57,641 --> 00:53:01,817
- I've asked around about you because...
- Because?

633
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:07,623
I won't do it again

634
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:11,998
I can't handle
a dishonest relationship,

635
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:16,701
and you can't handle an honest one

636
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:20,639
Never met an honest person

637
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:24,511
Even friends are tricky

638
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:27,478
They cheat you
when your back is turned

639
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:31,650
One has to play it safe

640
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,818
So what do we do?

641
00:53:43,753 --> 00:53:44,891
We'll manage

642
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:49,463
Don't want to

643
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,569
If you leave me, where will I go?

644
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:07,678
You'll follow me...to hell

645
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:13,158
I can't bear to see you cry

646
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:17,893
Why not? You'll have to

647
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:22,127
It stings my heart. I can't take it

648
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:37,944
I didn't let him down. He betrayed me

649
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:40,921
I ended up in hospital

650
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,156
It's the mental asylum next time

651
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:49,754
I'll be right behind you

652
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:53,960
Sure?

653
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,097
Sure

654
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:06,673
Well?

655
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,809
Hey listen

656
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:38,744
Listen to what I have to say

657
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:44,249
Don't have any grand illusions

658
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:50,180
If you fill me with longing,
I'll fill you with desire

659
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:55,659
Think it over now.
So don't ask me later

660
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:58,896
What's this thing between us?

661
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:00,058
What is it?

662
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:01,533
You know full well

663
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:04,697
What's this thing between us?

664
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:07,099
<i>Sweet words</i>

665
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:11,977
So much to say in nights so short

666
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:23,381
It's coming to flower, finally,
my love life is set to fly

667
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,993
My quirky love life!

668
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:56,713
You look cute aged 3.
I could've married you

669
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:00,126
And me you

670
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:06,729
Aged 3? Illegal!

671
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:12,563
Legal now. So marry me

672
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:20,647
Big talker!

673
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:21,841
Sure, I will

674
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:30,184
Yes! You're so lovely.
I'll marry you tomorrow

675
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:33,320
Tomorrow?

676
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:39,963
You think you scare me

677
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:43,330
Go away!

678
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:55,981
You ride Katrina

679
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:10,859
Hurry up! Get in!

680
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:34,880
It's an emergency wedding

681
00:58:39,249 --> 00:58:43,220
What's up? You look glum and gloomy

682
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:50,199
I need some advice

683
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,071
Wedding costs worrying you?

684
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,635
- What's this?
- Come aside

685
00:58:58,401 --> 00:59:01,143
- You caught an STD?
- No, my friend

686
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,376
Well?

687
00:59:05,675 --> 00:59:07,052
Why do people marry?

688
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:10,057
What? Another disappearing act?

689
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:11,820
I'm only asking

690
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:18,523
The sun didn't turn my hair grey.
I've catered for many weddings

691
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:22,064
A toastman recognizes a love letter
from its envelope

692
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:24,166
- You mean postman?
- Yeah, postman

693
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:27,341
- I knew it!
- How?

694
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:29,974
You have a shifty face

695
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,541
People can doubt

696
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:36,379
Even after marriage, they can.
So why fear doubt?

697
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:41,244
But if you ditch Gayatri,
don't show your face again

698
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:44,423
You worry about her. Not about me?

699
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:45,925
You're ok

700
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:49,995
You've hummed around her for ages

701
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:02,465
This is no time to think

702
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:10,047
You can doubt after marriage too.
Or no one would marry

703
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:15,982
Do yourself a favour. Calm down.
Look a prince at your ceremony

704
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:18,655
You'll make a happy couple

705
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:23,191
Blow smoke rings,
watch English movies. Enjoy life!

706
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:24,595
Who saying no?

707
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:26,361
A last doubt

708
01:00:26,756 --> 01:00:28,929
- You're so wise
- Tie that turban!

709
01:00:30,426 --> 01:00:33,168
May God keep them happy

710
01:00:35,698 --> 01:00:38,679
Stand guard at the front door.
You, at the back

711
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:40,881
- Who is coming?
- Just go!

712
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,586
Don't let him pee.

713
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:47,744
He's planning a bathroom visit

714
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:16,711
I need the bathroom

715
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:20,016
- After the ceremony
- Can't hold it that long

716
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:21,521
Don't be stubborn

717
01:01:21,611 --> 01:01:22,919
I can't wait

718
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:24,617
Be a good boy!

719
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:28,323
- I won't move
- But why?

720
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:30,687
I'll give you one

721
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,078
Move aside

722
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:53,347
What's going on?

723
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:56,356
Gayatri has gone

724
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:57,789
Where to?

725
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:00,357
The bathroom. To smoke

726
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,496
So where is she?

727
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:11,331
She's run away

728
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:32,349
You can pee now

729
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:07,319
A cold soda!

730
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:11,523
Offer my client a drink

731
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,396
How many sodas have you had?

732
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:15,059
Same number as my clients

733
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:20,130
I'll sell him your Benarasi veils

734
01:03:37,613 --> 01:03:40,560
New stock tomorrow. Bring him back

735
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:43,561
And my money? New clients, eh?

736
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:45,462
I'll pay. Don't you trust me?

737
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:48,602
A man whose bride jilted him...

738
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,968
...can't trust God.

739
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:52,370
So how can he trust you?

740
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,497
His bride ran?

741
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:58,736
She dumped him? He never said

742
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:01,338
So? She didn't rob you

743
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,611
How are you?

744
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,451
You oddball! Vanished from sight?

745
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:11,924
It may surprise you,
but weddings terrify me

746
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:14,955
Gayatri isn't in Jaipur now

747
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:18,961
She left your suitcase with me.
Pick it up

748
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:20,693
Shove that suitcase!

749
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:25,870
I was backing out.
You sweet-talked me. Got me caned

750
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:28,636
You caned someone, too

751
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:32,107
Caned with your own stick!
Score even now

752
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:38,041
What do you earn now? Peanuts!

753
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:41,880
Earn double as a groom's guest

754
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:46,191
- No more weddings
- One more. Then stop

755
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:49,158
A grand wedding coming up.
Charging double, paying double

756
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:53,023
You'll get a new suit and a gold chain

757
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:58,502
You lost one girl at a wedding,
you'll meet another there

758
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:00,369
Don't wish that on me, please

759
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:03,068
I'm off to Ajmer tomorrow
on a pilgrimage

760
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:05,907
That's where the wedding is

761
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:10,548
Go to the shrine with a free ticket
and a gold chain

762
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:13,684
What time do you leave?

763
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:16,450
That's more like it!

764
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:27,057
The groom's family are in the bus.
Hop on

765
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:29,726
Must we go with them?
They reek of perfume

766
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:36,868
Go! Make sure no one drinks.
Keep my honour

767
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,107
As if you kept mine

768
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:42,076
Didn't even let me pee

769
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:55,352
Isn't that her?

770
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:05,966
Make sure you get her this time

771
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:15,476
Tasty food at your wedding

772
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:26,384
Get into the jeep. I'll take the bus

773
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:29,328
I want to talk to her

774
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:30,796
To say what?

775
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:32,657
To say sorry

776
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:36,363
She'll give you a tight slap.
Say sorry!

777
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:39,702
Get into the jeep.

778
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:42,340
Hurry!

779
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:00,689
Remember that song?

780
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:07,667
Rajesh Khanna's Queen of my dreams,
where are you?

781
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:11,295
Sing a Gulzar song,
if you want more emotion

782
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:16,608
She has the right to hit you.
But why hit me?

783
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:20,213
I'll smash your face next time

784
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:23,951
You almost broke my shades

785
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,889
Welcome to my humble city!

786
01:07:40,022 --> 01:07:41,660
No formality!

787
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,499
We're only came from nearby Jaipur

788
01:07:43,592 --> 01:07:46,334
Tell me where's the gents toilet?

789
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:48,636
The toilet? It's busy

790
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:50,675
Never mind. We're in-laws now.

791
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,440
Life is all about adjusting

792
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:02,420
- What can I get you?
- The gold chain

793
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,290
- Let the ceremony start
- It won't! You brought...

794
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:07,327
the mother of wedding spoilers

795
01:08:08,884 --> 01:08:10,625
An international joke, sir

796
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:12,893
The groom's Dubai cousin

797
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:16,859
- A splendid wedding
- With your blessings

798
01:08:16,959 --> 01:08:19,371
The groom's cousin

799
01:08:19,462 --> 01:08:21,271
We know her well

800
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:23,171
Patience, my child

801
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:26,744
Sadly one stumbles
across wicked folk in life

802
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:31,684
May I show you the bathroom,
to freshen up?

803
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:43,428
The samosas are cold,
the tikkis are soft

804
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:46,061
The pompadums are ok.

805
01:08:46,155 --> 01:08:48,499
Guzzling free food, you bums?

806
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:54,199
She's a relative

807
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:57,339
The groom's cousin

808
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:01,812
First you dump her, now you ogle

809
01:09:12,848 --> 01:09:15,488
Why didn't you warn me?

810
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:22,899
I didn't know.
I only knew who was coming with me

811
01:09:23,626 --> 01:09:26,129
You had better slip away

812
01:09:26,195 --> 01:09:28,937
- What about my gold chain?
- Shut up!

813
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:37,346
The boy is ripe for marriage.
Or he'll be up to no good

814
01:09:39,108 --> 01:09:41,088
Kishorilal, how are you?

815
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:42,618
Give me a paan

816
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:45,355
What news?

817
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:49,686
Does your older son
write from America?

818
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:51,489
Does he call?

819
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:57,067
That's great.
Children happy, parents happy

820
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:02,006
You're standing? Bring a chair!

821
01:10:20,516 --> 01:10:21,824
Are you family?

822
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:24,790
What is he doing here?

823
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,834
I came with the groom's party.
I'm going to the Ajmer shrine...

824
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:33,497
<i>---t°</i> Pay my respects

825
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:35,798
A sheer coincidence. I usually...

826
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,206
...avoid weddings

827
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:39,142
Listen, my son

828
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:42,444
- Come with me, please
- You come here!

829
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:43,573
But I am here

830
01:10:43,706 --> 01:10:46,448
- What's going on?
- Nothing yet

831
01:10:46,508 --> 01:10:48,044
But it soon will

832
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:49,418
What Will?

833
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:52,156
Come this side, please

834
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:54,728
- You come here
- I am here

835
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:58,093
I've waited ages to settle scores
with this moron

836
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:00,728
Boys!

837
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:02,666
Avenge your sister today

838
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,696
Did I ask you to do anything?

839
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:08,867
You don't need to
Have we no self-respect?

840
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:11,066
Your parents gave us
your responsibility

841
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:12,303
When?

842
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:18,351
When did they do that? Time and day?

843
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:21,414
I forget

844
01:11:22,344 --> 01:11:25,757
They died in an accident in Delhi.
You weren't there

845
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:30,095
So what? Your responsibility
fell on us, right?

846
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:35,800
You're a distant uncle
who I met at weddings

847
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:37,370
Only the non-veg ones

848
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:42,074
Whatever happened is my problem.
Hejilted me

849
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:45,905
So please don't act on my behalf

850
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:47,978
This is my cousin's wedding

851
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:50,680
Not your vendetta party

852
01:11:51,006 --> 01:11:52,349
Here

853
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:54,949
Money for your return

854
01:11:55,878 --> 01:11:58,119
There's no need for that

855
01:11:58,414 --> 01:12:00,553
You're our guest. It's our duty

856
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:10,726
Now go, please

857
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:15,067
Get him a cold drink!

858
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:16,704
Start the music!

859
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:19,541
Come on

860
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:44,535
Ticket?

861
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:47,971
What for?

862
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:50,267
- To ride on this bus
- So throw me out

863
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:52,475
In this desert?

864
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:55,614
Shouldn't be a conductor
if you're soft-hearted

865
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:53,640
- A soda
- Which one?

866
01:13:53,896 --> 01:13:56,274
They're all the same

867
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:09,717
Give me a chance to explain

868
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:13,988
Explain what?
I didn't think before agreeing

869
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:18,460
Ten minutes before the ceremony,
I freaked out

870
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:22,801
You had come to see me
before the marriage

871
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:24,600
Why did you say yes then

872
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:30,337
Then I thought
such a beautiful girl...

873
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:33,676
How will I find again?
So you agreed without thinking

874
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:40,343
While you were garlanding me,
or hesitating to...

875
01:14:40,442 --> 01:14:42,479
...a girl was watching you

876
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:45,752
She pretended not to look.
Who was she?

877
01:14:46,114 --> 01:14:50,620
- Gayatri
- Your girlfriend?

878
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:55,668
Not then. But later

879
01:14:55,858 --> 01:14:57,394
Who proposed?

880
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:00,565
It was me who proposed

881
01:15:01,096 --> 01:15:02,598
You getting married?

882
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:08,813
We were about to. She changed her
mind at the wedding

883
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:10,846
So she jilted you?

884
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:12,850
She said nothing to me

885
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:15,581
She ran away?

886
01:15:18,413 --> 01:15:19,687
Did a runner!

887
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:29,327
Well! We're even now

888
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:33,968
Why did she dump you?

889
01:15:35,163 --> 01:15:37,575
She didn't say

890
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:39,235
Shall I tell you?

891
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:44,716
You ran from your marriage ceremony
in her presence

892
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:50,582
She may adore you. But would she
risk committing her life to you?

893
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,057
Get it?

894
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:56,623
Something good came out of your escape

895
01:15:56,852 --> 01:16:00,425
My family agreed I could be
an air-hostess

896
01:16:01,356 --> 01:16:03,393
I trained, got a job

897
01:16:03,525 --> 01:16:05,630
Moved straight to Jaipur

898
01:16:05,928 --> 01:16:09,501
They're free of me. I'm free of them

899
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:12,769
And we meet again

900
01:16:13,168 --> 01:16:15,876
Were you born a smarty?
Or caught an infection later?

901
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:31,488
Will you be my boyfriend?

902
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:35,291
Will you?

903
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:42,436
No marriage. You're unworthy

904
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:46,536
I didn't want to hurt you

905
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:49,446
My flight's at 5.
Four days duty in Chennai

906
01:16:50,205 --> 01:16:53,049
SMS me on Monday. We'll eat out

907
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:54,379
Where?

908
01:16:54,476 --> 01:16:56,353
Can't you find a restaurant in 4 days?

909
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:57,617
Or must I do that, too?

910
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:10,425
When he had a willing bride, he ran

911
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:13,966
And when he can't get a girl,
he pants after her

912
01:17:15,697 --> 01:17:17,904
Ok. Run!

913
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:20,547
We'll see if he runs

914
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:23,973
Now run

915
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,813
The girl turned out to be
quite the modern type

916
01:17:27,175 --> 01:17:29,212
Flying must have done it

917
01:17:29,611 --> 01:17:34,356
Air-hostesses are decent girls.
Passengers do the flirting

918
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:42,694
She's a good girl. I wronged her

919
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:46,966
Now enjoy the fruits of your deeds.
Sweet fruits at that

920
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:49,939
It's your life.

921
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:54,108
But marry her this time,
before anyone runs

922
01:17:56,104 --> 01:17:57,447
She doesn't want to marry

923
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,951
What does she want?

924
01:18:00,475 --> 01:18:02,477
To mess around?

925
01:18:02,811 --> 01:18:04,757
There's something in between

926
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:06,052
What?

927
01:18:06,214 --> 01:18:08,558
When it happens, you know it

928
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:10,754
So no one else knows?

929
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:12,795
Tell me something

930
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:18,127
She doesn't want to marry.
But don't you want to?

931
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:22,141
Would ajilted man commit
his life to anyone?

932
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:29,806
She won't marry because you ran

933
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:35,354
You won't marry because Gayatri ran

934
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:40,286
Gayatri won't marry because
she saw you run

935
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:42,753
You people run a lot.

936
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:46,522
After each other, away from each other

937
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:48,999
Must you run? Can't you stay put?

938
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:50,263
That's how it is

939
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:52,905
Who'll ever marry then?

940
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:55,063
How will I survive?

941
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:59,476
The marriage era is ending.
Better find other work

942
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:04,810
Really? No more weddings?

943
01:19:16,852 --> 01:19:18,126
What are you looking at?

944
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:21,594
You look lovely when you eat

945
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:23,969
- Really?
- Really

946
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:28,503
You look a right idiot when you flirt

947
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:40,917
How many days a month do you fly?

948
01:19:41,243 --> 01:19:42,153
Twenty-five

949
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:45,089
Do people behave in the air?

950
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:48,024
Like they do on the ground

951
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:54,264
In-flight drinking isn't allowed.
God help us if it were

952
01:19:55,323 --> 01:19:57,735
Do you believe in God?

953
01:19:58,493 --> 01:19:59,870
Do you?

954
01:20:00,262 --> 01:20:03,573
Me? Never thought about it

955
01:20:05,867 --> 01:20:09,007
Tell me something. The truth

956
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:14,344
What did you feel
when you saw me again?

957
01:20:14,943 --> 01:20:16,513
My heart nearly stopped

958
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:18,385
Why?

959
01:20:19,414 --> 01:20:20,722
Never mind

960
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:23,694
May I ask you something?

961
01:20:25,353 --> 01:20:30,393
When I ran away that day,
how did you feel?

962
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:33,802
What do you think?

963
01:20:35,463 --> 01:20:36,737
How could I feel?

964
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:39,608
How do I know?
You know how you felt

965
01:20:51,213 --> 01:20:53,090
What's the matter?

966
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:53,683
What is it?

967
01:20:53,748 --> 01:20:55,557
I didn't mean to hurt you

968
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:58,962
You never do a thing to hurt people

969
01:20:59,287 --> 01:21:01,062
They just enjoy getting hurt

970
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:05,570
You ask stupid questions with a smile

971
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:11,110
I shouldn't have seen you again

972
01:21:16,104 --> 01:21:17,515
Don't phone me

973
01:21:29,618 --> 01:21:33,532
My Playful heart...

974
01:21:33,688 --> 01:21:36,931
...makes its way to you

975
01:21:37,025 --> 01:21:42,976
Clasp this sinner's
heartstrings gently

976
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:50,040
They are made of fine silk

977
01:21:50,138 --> 01:21:53,483
Softly they will singe...

978
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:56,488
your lovely lips

979
01:21:56,544 --> 01:21:59,787
Soft words, soft steps

980
01:21:59,848 --> 01:22:02,886
Mix this brew over
softly burning flames

981
01:22:02,951 --> 01:22:06,524
When the brew is cooked

982
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:09,467
The air will fill
with a sweet fragrance

983
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:42,234
Why are you here?

984
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:50,901
Now you know how it feels?

985
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:54,874
Without explanation
when someone leaves you...

986
01:22:54,936 --> 01:22:57,041
...in the middle of nowhere

987
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:01,950
Did it hurt?

988
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:07,686
You must've lost faith in people

989
01:23:09,017 --> 01:23:12,464
It happened to you,
so I thought you'd get it

990
01:23:13,254 --> 01:23:16,326
But no, you understand nothing

991
01:23:19,427 --> 01:23:21,873
Never ask again how I felt

992
01:23:25,433 --> 01:23:27,003
Listen to me, one minute

993
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:33,114
When I ran...when I left,
I didn't know...

994
01:23:33,641 --> 01:23:34,847
What didn't you know?

995
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:41,752
That you would turn out to be
the girl I grew up dreaming of

996
01:23:43,785 --> 01:23:46,197
All that? In a week?

997
01:23:46,721 --> 01:23:51,795
A first glance is all it takes.
Or you never hit it off

998
01:23:54,796 --> 01:23:56,434
A favourite pick-up line?

999
01:23:58,533 --> 01:24:00,535
- You crazy?
- Without rehearsal...

1000
01:24:00,602 --> 01:24:01,808
...no one says a line so well

1001
01:24:09,244 --> 01:24:10,814
You're such a kid

1002
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:13,020
A big kid

1003
01:24:18,353 --> 01:24:19,593
Busy tomorrow?

1004
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:23,998
Phone me

1005
01:24:32,033 --> 01:24:36,880
When you came to see me,
I decided you'd be the last suitor

1006
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:39,315
I'd push you out with a slap

1007
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:41,114
Then you started talking

1008
01:24:41,276 --> 01:24:44,553
You were the first boy
who didn't mistakenly think...

1009
01:24:44,612 --> 01:24:46,922
...he was doing a favour by marrying.

1010
01:24:47,115 --> 01:24:50,961
Like the girl was a burden

1011
01:24:54,022 --> 01:24:57,868
Responsibility?
But you're your own person.

1012
01:24:58,393 --> 01:24:59,633
An air hostess

1013
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:04,433
I am not an air hostess

1014
01:25:08,203 --> 01:25:13,346
I go to the airport to see planes
and the crew take-off

1015
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:15,455
I grab a bite on the way home

1016
01:25:15,743 --> 01:25:18,519
A childhood dream come true

1017
01:25:19,481 --> 01:25:22,860
But why come to Jaipur?

1018
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:24,930
To settle a score

1019
01:25:25,553 --> 01:25:26,896
A score?

1020
01:25:27,522 --> 01:25:32,870
One can't just walk away.
One must work it out

1021
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:35,038
Or else how can one move on?

1022
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:39,610
But...

1023
01:25:41,402 --> 01:25:42,710
But what?

1024
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:47,647
You got hooked.
I wanted you to know how it felt

1025
01:25:55,016 --> 01:25:57,929
You boys respect girls you can't have

1026
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,757
If you have them, they're nothing

1027
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:10,704
All wasted on you

1028
01:26:13,801 --> 01:26:17,305
Let bygones be bygones.
Go your own way

1029
01:26:19,874 --> 01:26:21,717
What if I don't want to?

1030
01:26:26,748 --> 01:26:27,886
Marry me

1031
01:26:27,982 --> 01:26:29,393
Want a slap?

1032
01:26:29,584 --> 01:26:31,154
I mean it

1033
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:34,595
If you want to kiss me, have the guts.

1034
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:37,466
Why spin it?

1035
01:26:43,665 --> 01:26:45,611
Now what?

1036
01:26:46,301 --> 01:26:47,109
Answer me

1037
01:26:47,235 --> 01:26:48,373
I did

1038
01:26:48,503 --> 01:26:49,743
Must I slap you?

1039
01:26:53,608 --> 01:26:55,212
Ok.

1040
01:26:56,778 --> 01:26:58,587
I mean let's go

1041
01:26:59,847 --> 01:27:01,986
I'm frozen stiff, sitting here

1042
01:27:16,097 --> 01:27:18,008
Back off!

1043
01:27:46,894 --> 01:27:48,805
Many ways of flirting

1044
01:27:49,163 --> 01:27:53,270
But flirting with oneself takes
the cake

1045
01:27:54,469 --> 01:27:59,384
If someone jilts you and then
pursues you again...

1046
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:06,014
...it has its charms.
Makes you forget the past

1047
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:12,497
Can't tell if I'm walking or slipping

1048
01:28:29,771 --> 01:28:33,776
Dusk is pink. Dawn is pink

1049
01:28:33,841 --> 01:28:37,948
Pink is the colour of this city

1050
01:28:53,127 --> 01:28:54,936
Pink is me

1051
01:28:55,129 --> 01:28:57,006
Pink is you

1052
01:28:57,098 --> 01:29:01,103
Day is pink. Night is pink

1053
01:29:16,651 --> 01:29:20,531
My pink heartstrings have entwined you

1054
01:29:20,621 --> 01:29:24,330
Not through force nor deceit

1055
01:29:24,425 --> 01:29:31,741
Not binding you nor cheating you

1056
01:29:31,799 --> 01:29:35,713
Passion is pink. Feeling is pink

1057
01:29:35,803 --> 01:29:39,615
Swimming in pink waves

1058
01:29:39,707 --> 01:29:43,450
Speaking in pink, dreaming in pink

1059
01:29:43,544 --> 01:29:49,620
Wanting to live forever in pink

1060
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:06,204
I know in my heart...

1061
01:30:06,267 --> 01:30:10,738
...that pink is the colour of love

1062
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:45,245
Suffering is pink. Solace is pink

1063
01:30:45,373 --> 01:30:49,116
Cure is pink. Remedy is pink

1064
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:52,951
Dreams are pink. Nights are pink

1065
01:30:53,047 --> 01:30:57,120
Our gaze is pink,
and so is ourjourney

1066
01:31:04,759 --> 01:31:08,639
Pink is slow. Pink is fast

1067
01:31:08,729 --> 01:31:12,506
Rosy lips smile mischievously

1068
01:31:12,567 --> 01:31:16,208
If the dyer dips you in pink...

1069
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:20,309
...the world turns pink

1070
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:11,527
The Lord of Love has blessed me!

1071
01:32:14,028 --> 01:32:15,632
Drop it!

1072
01:32:18,332 --> 01:32:22,371
Get married before your roving eyes
rove again

1073
01:32:22,803 --> 01:32:25,249
Sorry! No more

1074
01:32:25,606 --> 01:32:31,488
A man can think: Enough is enough.
Now settle down

1075
01:32:31,646 --> 01:32:33,216
A miracle!

1076
01:32:33,514 --> 01:32:37,985
Even the Gods did not have
a second chance

1077
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:41,493
When are you proposing?

1078
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:44,629
I want to, but...

1079
01:32:47,161 --> 01:32:51,371
I scare myself sometimes.
Have I really changed?

1080
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:57,380
I once agreed to marry Tara
and then left. And for whom?

1081
01:32:58,806 --> 01:33:02,151
If you can't control your eyes
or heart, you can't control...

1082
01:33:02,209 --> 01:33:04,587
...your life

1083
01:33:06,347 --> 01:33:08,088
I scare myself, my friend

1084
01:33:08,215 --> 01:33:12,925
That fear stops men from
becoming beasts

1085
01:33:14,055 --> 01:33:18,800
But if you let fear stop you.
You'll never live

1086
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:21,433
Tie that knot!

1087
01:33:22,563 --> 01:33:25,009
Shall I propose?

1088
01:33:25,066 --> 01:33:27,444
Take God's name and ask!

1089
01:33:27,501 --> 01:33:29,913
When it's done, it's done

1090
01:33:30,037 --> 01:33:33,348
That's how weddings work!

1091
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:35,815
Get her along for tonight's wedding

1092
01:33:35,943 --> 01:33:37,945
Be Gutsy. propose!

1093
01:33:52,994 --> 01:33:54,598
She's lovely

1094
01:33:57,898 --> 01:34:00,344
What are you doing?

1095
01:34:01,135 --> 01:34:02,512
Shall we congratulate them?

1096
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:06,448
- Let's first attack the food
- Shameless!

1097
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:12,791
- You're sneaky!
- I'm the groom's guest

1098
01:34:31,465 --> 01:34:32,603
Shall we?

1099
01:34:39,407 --> 01:34:42,354
- Take the plate
- Yeah, sure

1100
01:34:52,420 --> 01:34:56,869
- Why is she here?
- It's your friend's wedding

1101
01:34:57,525 --> 01:34:58,731
Must be her friend, too

1102
01:34:59,026 --> 01:35:00,437
Or a hired extra like you?

1103
01:35:00,494 --> 01:35:03,134
Meaning?

1104
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:06,406
- Why are you so upset?
- Who? Me?

1105
01:35:08,102 --> 01:35:09,410
You ok?

1106
01:35:10,304 --> 01:35:12,341
Your boyfriend?

1107
01:35:13,641 --> 01:35:16,884
Pick up the priest at the station.
He's stranded there

1108
01:35:16,944 --> 01:35:18,048
Hurry!

1109
01:35:18,145 --> 01:35:22,525
- Don't know the way to the station
- Me neither

1110
01:35:26,020 --> 01:35:27,590
Go with him.

1111
01:35:27,655 --> 01:35:29,100
Be quick!

1112
01:35:29,190 --> 01:35:30,328
Its ok, we'll find it

1113
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:34,237
You come with me
Groom's mom is also not well

1114
01:35:34,628 --> 01:35:36,005
Go on, hurry! Come here

1115
01:35:36,597 --> 01:35:38,235
- Well, I...
- What?

1116
01:35:43,671 --> 01:35:45,378
I need the bathroom

1117
01:35:50,411 --> 01:35:51,515
How he glared!

1118
01:35:52,713 --> 01:35:54,818
I didn't choose to run from my wedding

1119
01:35:57,284 --> 01:35:59,025
He doesn't know what love is

1120
01:36:00,154 --> 01:36:01,428
I did all the caring

1121
01:36:03,858 --> 01:36:10,104
I was serious about him,
washing his torn underwear.

1122
01:36:10,564 --> 01:36:12,134
Started prying into my past

1123
01:36:13,901 --> 01:36:19,112
He'd ditch me one day.
Bridal clothes wouldn't change that

1124
01:36:22,543 --> 01:36:23,851
It broke my heart

1125
01:36:29,016 --> 01:36:35,023
When a heart breaks for the third or
fourth time, it makes no sound

1126
01:36:37,358 --> 01:36:38,666
Your senses shut down

1127
01:36:41,162 --> 01:36:42,505
You feel numb all over

1128
01:36:48,335 --> 01:36:49,541
Wearing the maroon shirt?

1129
01:36:51,539 --> 01:36:52,984
Don't you know it doesn't suit you?

1130
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:56,988
I gave it to him

1131
01:36:58,646 --> 01:37:01,957
And...there he is,
wearing it on a date

1132
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:21,839
Lightning won't strike if we talked

1133
01:37:34,481 --> 01:37:36,961
I couldn't face my family in Guwahati

1134
01:37:37,785 --> 01:37:43,792
I moved to a friend's place.
Then returned to the flat

1135
01:38:11,619 --> 01:38:15,066
Did you approach her? Or she you?

1136
01:38:19,927 --> 01:38:20,735
Answer me

1137
01:38:22,396 --> 01:38:23,397
You jealous?

1138
01:38:24,865 --> 01:38:26,469
Things aren't that desperate

1139
01:38:36,777 --> 01:38:38,723
Anyway you won't marry

1140
01:38:38,812 --> 01:38:39,950
Why?

1141
01:38:40,314 --> 01:38:44,626
A leopard never changes its spots.
Remember that

1142
01:38:44,818 --> 01:38:47,526
How would you know? You ran

1143
01:38:47,588 --> 01:38:49,033
So did you

1144
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:50,902
That was different

1145
01:38:53,327 --> 01:38:55,432
If you were to marry her, you would've

1146
01:38:55,496 --> 01:38:58,102
I'm marrying the girl
I was meant to marry

1147
01:38:58,165 --> 01:38:59,974
And would've, if I hadn't met you

1148
01:39:02,836 --> 01:39:05,442
Give us your blessings. Hush now!

1149
01:39:14,682 --> 01:39:16,320
My blessings? Am I your mother?

1150
01:39:18,819 --> 01:39:20,162
Stop at the petrol station

1151
01:39:23,190 --> 01:39:24,168
I need the bathroom

1152
01:39:28,295 --> 01:39:30,172
You have 10 minutes to think

1153
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:35,910
- Come with me
- I don't need to go

1154
01:39:36,637 --> 01:39:38,344
I'm not going alone. This is India

1155
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:54,494
Weren't you going to dump me?

1156
01:39:56,323 --> 01:39:57,097
Nonsense!

1157
01:39:57,358 --> 01:39:58,268
It's true

1158
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,168
Don't talk rubbish

1159
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:01,102
It's true

1160
01:40:03,163 --> 01:40:05,302
I didn't run, Gayatri. You did

1161
01:40:05,866 --> 01:40:08,346
A man who covers his back
doesn't look ahead

1162
01:40:10,437 --> 01:40:11,973
But one must play it safe

1163
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:27,321
You're really getting married?

1164
01:40:34,762 --> 01:40:36,002
Thought it over?

1165
01:40:44,705 --> 01:40:45,775
Alright

1166
01:40:55,049 --> 01:40:56,528
Had your fun?

1167
01:40:56,617 --> 01:40:57,857
I'm talking to the priest

1168
01:41:00,654 --> 01:41:03,794
May I freshen up first?

1169
01:41:03,857 --> 01:41:07,430
Let the ceremony begin,
everything will freshen up

1170
01:41:14,168 --> 01:41:19,083
Let's bury the past. I've moved on

1171
01:41:19,173 --> 01:41:20,311
The priest is inside

1172
01:41:20,374 --> 01:41:21,352
You busy?

1173
01:41:24,678 --> 01:41:27,284
Busy? Not at all

1174
01:41:32,386 --> 01:41:33,831
You're Gayatri?

1175
01:41:39,259 --> 01:41:40,260
It's getting late

1176
01:41:42,596 --> 01:41:44,098
What did she say?

1177
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:47,770
- Nothing much
- Musfve said something

1178
01:41:50,304 --> 01:41:53,376
The usual. How are you? Etc

1179
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,283
- Then?
- Then what?

1180
01:41:55,642 --> 01:42:00,614
- What did you say?
- I'm ok. Thank you. Etc

1181
01:42:03,016 --> 01:42:05,895
Ok. Now tell me about the etc

1182
01:42:07,254 --> 01:42:09,256
The priest was sitting behind us

1183
01:42:11,058 --> 01:42:12,196
What a tragedy

1184
01:42:14,428 --> 01:42:15,463
Introduce us

1185
01:42:17,364 --> 01:42:18,365
What's the point?

1186
01:42:19,299 --> 01:42:21,006
I'll find out all your secrets

1187
01:42:21,502 --> 01:42:22,981
I have none

1188
01:42:24,404 --> 01:42:27,476
- Why so ed ?
- Who? Meg';

1189
01:42:28,275 --> 01:42:30,346
The smoke is irritating my eyes

1190
01:42:31,912 --> 01:42:34,222
No smoke without fire

1191
01:42:35,682 --> 01:42:38,629
She's cool. But you're tense

1192
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:41,265
Sit with her then

1193
01:42:43,624 --> 01:42:50,132
Calm down. I wasn't born yesterday

1194
01:42:55,636 --> 01:42:57,172
Get me a cold drink, please

1195
01:42:58,939 --> 01:43:00,384
A cold drink, please

1196
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:08,084
open m

1197
01:43:32,306 --> 01:43:34,445
I've asked Gayatri for dinner
on Sunday

1198
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:38,053
I'm very busy on Sunday

1199
01:43:38,512 --> 01:43:40,856
You're never busy. So why Sunday?

1200
01:43:41,748 --> 01:43:44,888
You can't spare any time for an ex?

1201
01:43:55,462 --> 01:43:57,271
Why go to the station with her?

1202
01:43:57,364 --> 01:44:02,404
- You didn't say she was in Jaipur
- You'd be all upset. Sort it out

1203
01:44:02,903 --> 01:44:04,541
I'm tryingmbut...

1204
01:44:07,541 --> 01:44:08,918
But what?

1205
01:44:10,244 --> 01:44:13,714
Maybe I should slow it down

1206
01:44:15,215 --> 01:44:19,755
The jitters again?
Did you propose to Tara?

1207
01:44:21,288 --> 01:44:24,098
I thought I'd wait. Till Sunday

1208
01:44:25,425 --> 01:44:28,269
Forget about Sunday, sonny!

1209
01:44:29,062 --> 01:44:33,010
Keep those girls apart. Propose now!

1210
01:44:43,010 --> 01:44:44,580
I was about to. I'll propose now

1211
01:44:46,146 --> 01:44:47,250
To whom?

1212
01:44:47,447 --> 01:44:50,257
Tara! Who else! You amaze me

1213
01:44:50,350 --> 01:44:53,854
Amaze you?
You're king in that department

1214
01:44:54,521 --> 01:44:56,330
Now stop over-thinking

1215
01:44:56,890 --> 01:45:00,428
Jitters cannot get in the way
of marriage

1216
01:45:00,627 --> 01:45:01,867
Or of having children

1217
01:45:01,928 --> 01:45:03,566
Family life is a haven

1218
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:09,109
Family life gives us peace. Wait!
Take my advice

1219
01:45:09,503 --> 01:45:11,449
You seem edgy today

1220
01:45:11,905 --> 01:45:12,815
Now you see

1221
01:45:45,238 --> 01:45:48,447
She's a nice girl.
You should marry her

1222
01:45:51,712 --> 01:45:54,886
That's if you marry at all

1223
01:46:00,921 --> 01:46:02,025
Something on your mind?

1224
01:46:08,328 --> 01:46:09,398
Making a mistake

1225
01:46:14,334 --> 01:46:15,074
Why?

1226
01:46:16,169 --> 01:46:17,546
You won't be happy with her

1227
01:46:18,772 --> 01:46:21,514
You're lying to yourself

1228
01:46:23,443 --> 01:46:25,013
You know what's worse?

1229
01:46:26,012 --> 01:46:27,252
She won't be happy

1230
01:46:30,417 --> 01:46:31,521
But I'm happy

1231
01:46:32,753 --> 01:46:33,823
You're lying

1232
01:46:35,522 --> 01:46:36,592
How many more lies?

1233
01:46:38,392 --> 01:46:39,462
Well?

1234
01:46:40,927 --> 01:46:45,034
At least I have guts.
You're running away again

1235
01:46:45,198 --> 01:46:47,200
I didn't run
Gayatri, you ran

1236
01:46:48,935 --> 01:46:52,974
I made a mistake, your turn now.
Then me, then you

1237
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:54,813
Must we make the same mistake?

1238
01:46:58,078 --> 01:47:00,684
I didn't leave, Gayatri. You did

1239
01:47:16,730 --> 01:47:18,209
I don't want us to be friends

1240
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:22,402
Nor have dinner as your sister.

1241
01:47:23,804 --> 01:47:26,045
You can be friends, but I can't

1242
01:47:27,774 --> 01:47:29,185
That's the way it is

1243
01:48:08,148 --> 01:48:10,389
I'll call Mr Goel

1244
01:48:11,017 --> 01:48:13,793
No one goes to the bathroom

1245
01:48:17,858 --> 01:48:18,893
Get inside!

1246
01:48:26,066 --> 01:48:28,171
We need two minutes to talk in private

1247
01:48:29,302 --> 01:48:30,372
About what, sir?

1248
01:48:30,670 --> 01:48:32,479
On the lines of your dilemma

1249
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:34,710
Dilemma?

1250
01:48:34,875 --> 01:48:36,115
I'm here to check the lights

1251
01:48:36,176 --> 01:48:37,883
Of course!

1252
01:48:37,944 --> 01:48:39,082
Another mess!

1253
01:48:40,780 --> 01:48:42,453
Hey you kids. Come here

1254
01:48:42,749 --> 01:48:48,028
Check all the lights
and the bulbs you want

1255
01:48:48,355 --> 01:48:53,498
- No trouble at my wedding, sir?
- I won't make trouble for you

1256
01:48:53,894 --> 01:48:57,205
But on the hot water you're brewing?
No guarantees

1257
01:49:00,901 --> 01:49:02,278
Damn it! The kids today

1258
01:49:05,038 --> 01:49:06,142
It wasn't me

1259
01:49:08,041 --> 01:49:09,543
I didn't invite her here

1260
01:49:09,876 --> 01:49:10,286
So?

1261
01:49:10,877 --> 01:49:12,322
I couldn't ignore her

1262
01:49:12,379 --> 01:49:13,517
You could have

1263
01:49:18,151 --> 01:49:21,462
What do women see in you?
Why do they come back?

1264
01:49:21,821 --> 01:49:25,325
- I didn't ask her back
- Didn't chase her away either

1265
01:49:55,121 --> 01:49:55,997
I'll get off

1266
01:49:56,089 --> 01:49:57,864
No. It's all right

1267
01:50:16,676 --> 01:50:17,780
Listen

1268
01:50:19,379 --> 01:50:21,518
I didn't want to hurt you

1269
01:50:23,383 --> 01:50:24,726
I didn't think...

1270
01:50:24,784 --> 01:50:25,888
about me

1271
01:50:31,291 --> 01:50:35,967
But you must've thought,
how to rely on a marriage-bolter?

1272
01:50:36,696 --> 01:50:37,766
You were kind to me.

1273
01:50:52,012 --> 01:50:53,252
You even offered me a cold drink

1274
01:50:54,914 --> 01:50:55,984
I liked that

1275
01:50:56,683 --> 01:50:57,753
It's nothing

1276
01:50:58,752 --> 01:51:00,857
When I'm confused,
I have a cold drink.

1277
01:51:02,555 --> 01:51:03,431
It's comforting

1278
01:51:11,598 --> 01:51:13,271
You were a lovely bride

1279
01:51:15,001 --> 01:51:16,378
You saw everything

1280
01:51:17,537 --> 01:51:19,210
He didn't run because of me

1281
01:51:20,607 --> 01:51:21,677
Really?

1282
01:51:22,342 --> 01:51:24,913
- Not because of me...
- Then why?

1283
01:51:30,884 --> 01:51:32,386
It's Gayatri I really care about

1284
01:51:34,954 --> 01:51:42,168
From the day I first saw her,
my bones have trembled

1285
01:51:46,332 --> 01:51:49,040
But whatever happens
I can't hurt Tara again

1286
01:51:51,104 --> 01:51:52,208
Why?

1287
01:51:52,539 --> 01:51:53,950
You have to make amends.

1288
01:51:54,941 --> 01:51:57,854
You can't always follow the heart

1289
01:52:26,039 --> 01:52:28,110
I didn't tell him to

1290
01:52:31,411 --> 01:52:33,254
I'd die, but wouldn't do that.

1291
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:35,150
I know

1292
01:52:37,016 --> 01:52:38,689
Why see him again?

1293
01:52:39,552 --> 01:52:40,394
You're mad

1294
01:52:40,453 --> 01:52:41,625
I didn't come after him.

1295
01:52:43,690 --> 01:52:45,670
He pursued me

1296
01:52:48,361 --> 01:52:50,432
My wound wasn't healing

1297
01:52:51,798 --> 01:52:56,042
If we talked, I thought I'd find
some peace

1298
01:52:58,071 --> 01:52:59,175
Have you?

1299
01:53:05,545 --> 01:53:06,853
I'm going home

1300
01:53:12,652 --> 01:53:16,498
Leaving me with a second-hand love?
Your sacrifice?

1301
01:53:17,290 --> 01:53:18,360
Do I matter?

1302
01:53:19,659 --> 01:53:20,797
It's no sacrifice

1303
01:53:24,464 --> 01:53:25,534
Give me two minutes

1304
01:53:33,373 --> 01:53:36,911
That moment, I shall never
forget that moment

1305
01:53:38,077 --> 01:53:42,992
Remembering what happens
when falling in love is difficult

1306
01:53:43,817 --> 01:53:49,096
When you fall out of love,
you never forget that moment

1307
01:53:51,024 --> 01:53:54,301
As I gave her the cold drink,
the feeling vanished

1308
01:53:54,661 --> 01:53:56,572
I still don't know why it vanished

1309
01:53:57,597 --> 01:54:02,478
After all, if he was with Gayatri
or Katrina Kaif made no odds

1310
01:54:04,804 --> 01:54:07,307
Sitting with her in the bus made me
want to laugh at us three

1311
01:54:08,374 --> 01:54:09,444
I was freed

1312
01:54:10,276 --> 01:54:13,120
Honestly? I didn't even feel
like saying bye

1313
01:54:14,214 --> 01:54:15,284
What difference anyway?

1314
01:54:17,083 --> 01:54:19,256
She isn't back? Where is she?

1315
01:54:22,388 --> 01:54:23,890
The air hostess has flown

1316
01:54:33,466 --> 01:54:34,240
Are you done?

1317
01:54:39,706 --> 01:54:41,276
They'll start looking for me soon

1318
01:54:42,542 --> 01:54:43,646
I must go

1319
01:54:48,982 --> 01:54:52,623
Did you want to say something?

1320
01:54:58,524 --> 01:54:59,594
Speak!

1321
01:55:01,427 --> 01:55:02,770
You go first

1322
01:55:02,862 --> 01:55:04,205
Decide who you'll marry

1323
01:55:04,964 --> 01:55:06,170
Something to say?

1324
01:55:09,168 --> 01:55:10,238
Say it

1325
01:55:12,171 --> 01:55:13,548
Stop beating around the bush

1326
01:55:15,475 --> 01:55:15,714
Now say it

1327
01:55:16,943 --> 01:55:18,820
Your situation is more urgent
than mine

1328
01:55:18,878 --> 01:55:19,879
I think yours is

1329
01:55:19,946 --> 01:55:20,788
Speak up!

1330
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:22,257
Love you

1331
01:55:23,016 --> 01:55:24,086
I just love you

1332
01:55:33,993 --> 01:55:36,667
Need hired guests? Goel Caterers

1333
01:55:37,764 --> 01:55:40,973
Your family won't come,
if the lightman is the groom

1334
01:55:41,067 --> 01:55:42,774
Goel Caterers. Don't forget

1335
01:55:43,970 --> 01:55:45,210
Go! Stay happy

1336
01:55:52,245 --> 01:55:56,921
You've hummed around
each other since you met

1337
01:55:57,717 --> 01:55:59,492
Have you nothing to say?

1338
01:56:02,021 --> 01:56:02,624
No

1339
01:56:02,822 --> 01:56:03,459
Yes

1340
01:56:07,293 --> 01:56:09,398
That quagmire of yours...

1341
01:56:09,629 --> 01:56:11,575
...no one can survive it

1342
01:56:13,366 --> 01:56:15,039
Your air hostess was wise

1343
01:56:15,802 --> 01:56:19,249
She left just in time.
Or you'd drown her too

1344
01:56:20,373 --> 01:56:22,114
Have you both had enough?

1345
01:56:22,875 --> 01:56:24,013
Any last wishes?

1346
01:56:25,011 --> 01:56:28,151
Listen to your elders sometimes

1347
01:56:40,393 --> 01:56:41,804
Greetings to you!

1348
01:56:45,765 --> 01:56:48,041
Look. They're getting married

1349
01:56:48,468 --> 01:56:52,541
Make notes. It'll help you some day
and help me

1350
01:57:20,366 --> 01:57:22,368
You go first

1351
01:57:24,337 --> 01:57:26,510
It's ok. You first

1352
01:57:28,574 --> 01:57:30,781
Same thing. Go on

1353
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:22,030
Sit down

1354
01:58:37,844 --> 01:58:40,017
- A smoke?
- Stop that

1355
01:58:51,057 --> 01:58:52,161
Give

1356
01:59:03,803 --> 01:59:04,873
What are you doing here?

1357
01:59:08,941 --> 01:59:10,011
Where could I go?

1358
01:59:16,382 --> 01:59:17,827
I want to ask you something

1359
01:59:19,952 --> 01:59:23,991
Why did you run, just now?

1360
01:59:26,726 --> 01:59:27,830
Why did you?

1361
01:59:36,302 --> 01:59:40,375
Marriage doesn't suit me

1362
01:59:43,509 --> 01:59:44,817
Not for now

1363
01:59:46,879 --> 01:59:47,949
Why not?

1364
01:59:48,514 --> 01:59:49,925
How can you ask me that?

1365
01:59:52,118 --> 01:59:53,062
I'll tell you why

1366
01:59:55,655 --> 01:59:59,660
Hired wedding guests are
the first to spot the pretence

1367
02:00:04,130 --> 02:00:05,473
The groom's pretend mates,
pretend joy, fake rituals,

1368
02:00:06,732 --> 02:00:08,803
When marriage is a transaction,
how to persuade...

1369
02:00:10,203 --> 02:00:11,375
...anyone to marry?

1370
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:15,947
I thought I was the idiot

1371
02:00:17,810 --> 02:00:19,812
Everyone marries so easily...

1372
02:00:19,946 --> 02:00:22,392
...so I must have a problem
- Only one?

1373
02:00:23,516 --> 02:00:24,586
You're right

1374
02:00:25,651 --> 02:00:27,324
When I ran without thinking...

1375
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:29,522
I ended up at your flat. Why here?

1376
02:00:34,193 --> 02:00:35,263
Then I understood

1377
02:00:37,663 --> 02:00:38,835
When we lived together...

1378
02:00:39,131 --> 02:00:42,340
...it was our choice.
The door was open for us both

1379
02:00:44,704 --> 02:00:49,244
But if the door is closed and
I can't leave, I want to run

1380
02:00:50,543 --> 02:00:51,954
So why must we marry?

1381
02:00:57,950 --> 02:00:59,293
We love each other

1382
02:01:02,989 --> 02:01:04,093
Right?

1383
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:15,870
Well?

1384
02:01:17,303 --> 02:01:18,407
Well!

1385
02:01:25,311 --> 02:01:26,915
What shall we do?

1386
02:01:30,516 --> 02:01:32,792
Don't know. My head aches

1387
02:01:33,753 --> 02:01:36,029
I'll make you some tea

1388
02:01:40,192 --> 02:01:43,969
If it's only for today, then let me

1389
02:02:40,286 --> 02:02:44,132
Shall I come back later?
With my suitcase?

1390
02:02:58,471 --> 02:03:01,384
- Hope you didn't see anything
- No

1391
02:03:01,841 --> 02:03:03,411
Well done!

1392
02:03:04,377 --> 02:03:07,119
Kids have their own in-built censor

1393
02:03:12,685 --> 02:03:14,722
When you grow up,
you'll get married?

1394
02:03:17,623 --> 02:03:20,160
You will marry, won't you?

1395
02:03:20,726 --> 02:03:22,603
Well? Won't you?

1396
02:03:22,795 --> 02:03:24,001
I need the bathroom

1397
02:03:25,264 --> 02:03:27,767
Bloody hell!
