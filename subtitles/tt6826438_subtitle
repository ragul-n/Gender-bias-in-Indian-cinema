1
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,280
<i>Last week China conducted</i>
<i>one more nuclear test.</i>

2
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,400
<i>This was the 43rd nuclear test</i>
<i>conducted by the Chinese.</i>

3
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,760
<i>It is believed that</i>
<i>this atom bomb is powerful</i>

4
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,080
<i>enough to destroy</i>
<i>any major cities in India.</i>

5
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,480
Our neighboring country
has conducted yet another test.

6
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,240
Now it is our turn
to give a befitting reply.

7
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,000
You tell me when and how.

8
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,880
I'll personally submit a report
to the Prime Minister.

9
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,160
Sir, we need to be very
careful with our words.

10
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,440
In my opinion, let's not
send our badminton team this year

11
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,800
to any tournament China is participating.

12
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,240
Sir. Let's ban Chinese food.

13
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,000
Let’s refuse to export
Alphonso mangoes to China this year.

14
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,040
Are momos originally from China?

15
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,200
I am fond of them.

16
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,880
We should also conduct a nuclear test.

17
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,080
Huh?

18
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,520
Who are you?

19
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,800
Ashwat Raina, sir.

20
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,920
Which department are you from?

21
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,680
That's fine.

22
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,200
You can't just dish out
your opinions here.

23
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,840
Instead, you listen to us, mister.

24
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,120
Here we are, discussing
and criticizing their moves

25
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,000
and you've come up with
something completely irrelevant.

26
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,760
This is the time for action,
not criticisms.

27
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,960
What do you mean?

28
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,800
Should we also carry out an explosion?

29
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,640
If we have an atom bomb,
there will be peace in the country.

30
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,960
Your research is weak, Mr. Raina.

31
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,520
We possess an atom bomb since 1974.

32
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,360
That was a peaceful nuclear explosion.

33
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,040
There is a car in the garage.

34
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,040
How do we find out
whether we can still drive it?

35
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,560
You don’t have to worry about the car.

36
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,440
Let him speak, Tripathi

37
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,520
while we wait for our tea.

38
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,040
Go on, son.

39
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,040
We're having a hush-hush conversation.

40
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,680
Why?

41
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,880
When will India be respected
by the rest of the world?

42
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,400
Take the USA for instance.

43
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,600
They have tested more than
a thousand atom bombs.

44
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,960
On land, under the water and in the sky.

45
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,080
Today, they are a superpower.

46
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,440
Following in their footsteps is China.

47
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,680
So far, they've conducted 43 tests

48
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,080
and are supplying
atom bombs to Pakistan.

49
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,400
An existential crisis looms
on the horizon

50
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,160
while we sit and criticize in fear.

51
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,120
Don't chant peace and cower in fear.

52
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,120
Take action and profess peace.

53
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,120
-There, our tea has arrived.
-Snacks as well.

54
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,000
Sir, I have the entire plan ready
on this floppy disk.

55
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,240
We can't let the Americans know
about this test.

56
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,840
Else they might attack us.

57
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,080
Their satellites
are always watching us...

58
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,880
Why don’t you give me the floppy disk?

59
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,400
I'll handle this.
Give it to me.

60
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,560
Give it to me.

61
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,240
Listen.

62
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,760
-What did you say your name was?
-Ashwat.

63
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,760
Yes.

64
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,840
Avoid giving speeches
when you talk about these things.

65
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,640
These things need to be dealt sensitively.

66
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,480
Why don’t you prepare a report on this?

67
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,480
-It will be ready by tomorrow.
-Hmm.

68
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,360
And yes, it has to be brief.

69
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,680
The Prime Minister doesn't
have the time to read lengthy reports.

70
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,840
Keep it short and simple

71
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,200
and I’ll fix up your
next meeting with him.

72
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,120
You carry on.

73
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,440
Ashwat, come here.

74
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,160
This boy tires me out!

75
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,080
What's going on?

76
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,280
You seem to be very happy today.

77
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,640
Are you all right?

78
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,920
Come on,
I am not serious all the time. Yes, you are!

79
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,800
Always!

80
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,640
I deserve a medal,
just like your father.

81
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,240
For being so happy in spite of
having such a serious husband.

82
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,880
I think I will finally

83
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,400
be able to do something
for our country, just like dad.

84
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,000
You know, I might have a meeting with
the Prime Minister.

85
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,240
You know, he wanted me
to join the army like he did.

86
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,720
Ashwat, you don't need to don a uniform
to become a hero. Your attitude is enough.

87
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,280
And I am sure the Prime Minister will
definitely be impressed with you.

88
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,520
Now will you tell me
what this meeting is about?

89
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,560
I will.

90
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,320
After the meeting.

91
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,360
Come on, Ashwat! Do you want
the Prime Minister to wait?

92
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,760
I had to make it brief,
there is so much information.

93
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,520
-It had to be...
-Fine. Give me the file.

94
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,280
Sir, may I go with you?

95
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,320
Where?

96
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,760
Don’t worry. I will handle this.
Sit over there.

97
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,360
You have no idea how useful
this nuclear plan is for our country.

98
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,840
Mr. Yadav has come up
with a brilliant idea.

99
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,400
Once we conduct this test,
our Chinese neighbors will know.

100
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,480
Don't chant peace and cower in fear.
Take action and profess peace.

101
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,240
That's great, sir.

102
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,520
<i>Last morning,</i>
<i>American satellites got wind</i>

103
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,080
<i>of India's nuclear test.</i>

104
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,680
<i>After a strict warning</i>
<i>from President Clinton</i>

105
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,600
<i>the nuclear project</i>
<i>has been halted.</i>

106
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,200
<i>America has warned India</i>

107
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:05,280
<i>of military action at their nuclear sites</i>
<i>if they don’t stop immediately.</i>

108
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,080
<i>Pakistan has also raised</i>
<i>strong objections in this matter.</i>

109
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,160
Let me make it clear, we were
conducting routine checks in Pokhran

110
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,200
and not preparing for any tests.

111
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,200
This is a case of misunderstanding.

112
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,840
We will soon find out
who is behind this hullabaloo.

113
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,280
I have nothing to do with
the execution of this mission.

114
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,400
Mr. Yadav, you didn’t even
let me meet the Prime Minister.

115
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,880
Aren’t you glad I didn’t?

116
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,920
Your plan was terribly flawed.

117
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,800
You were so sure of it at the time.

118
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,360
Look what happened!

119
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,840
You embarrassed our country
in front of the whole world.

120
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,600
Did anyone even pay
attention to my plan?

121
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,040
You cannot summarize
so much information

122
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,680
on such a huge project,
in two pages.

123
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,280
The mission was completed without me.

124
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,200
Now that it has failed,
I am being held responsible.

125
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,760
Since you knew all this,
why didn’t you give us the full details?

126
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,200
Sir, I gave you the floppy disk.

127
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,680
It's still lying around.

128
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,720
Had you seen it...

129
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,520
You are suspended
with immediate effect.

130
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,600
<i>I haven’t even woken up</i>

131
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,200
<i>Why is it dawn already?</i>

132
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,480
<i>Before I could even begin</i>

133
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,480
<i>It's all over</i>

134
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,760
<i>My coveted dream</i>

135
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,320
<i>Is now lost forever</i>

136
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,040
<i>Ashwat should've appealed against</i>
<i>his suspension order.</i>

137
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,320
I gave you Mr. Sharma's number, Sushma.

138
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,480
Please speak softly, he might hear you.

139
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,680
You know, he doesn’t
like to talk about his work.

140
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,400
Even I don’t know what happened.

141
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,360
Still, it has already been two months.

142
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,680
Why doesn’t Ashwat look for another job?

143
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,840
He has done his engineering from IIT!

144
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,240
I still have my job
at the observatory.

145
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,480
Mussoorie will be a
change of scene for Ashwat.

146
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,120
He has a different ambition.

147
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,280
He wants to do something
for his country.

148
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,960
What country?
The country has abandoned him.

149
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,000
If you do night shifts,
how will you take care of Prahlad?

150
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,720
Papa, please speak softly.

151
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,160
Don’t worry.

152
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,440
<i>So precious were those dreams</i>

153
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,080
<i>So close to my heart</i>

154
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,360
<i>I can't reminisce</i>

155
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,240
<i>So precious were those memories</i>

156
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,920
<i>Tried so hard to hold on to them</i>

157
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,600
<i>Tried so hard to hold on to them</i>

158
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,120
<i>But my dream, my coveted dream</i>

159
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,160
<i>Is now lost forever</i>

160
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,800
<i>My dream, my coveted dream</i>

161
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,600
<i>My dream, my coveted dream</i>

162
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,680
<i>My coveted dream is lost forever</i>

163
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,160
<i>Is lost forever</i>

164
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,200
<i>Hi, son. Had your milk?</i>

165
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,400
Not tonight.

166
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,040
You’ll have to a drink some milk.

167
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,080
Have you finished your science project?

168
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,240
You have to submit it tomorrow.

169
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,160
<i>Where is your dad?</i>

170
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,120
He's teaching.

171
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,800
It's late, isn't it?

172
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,760
Sir, excuse me, it's 8 already.

173
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,040
So?

174
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,200
I want to go home.

175
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,560
Wasn’t our class
supposed to be till 6 p.m?

176
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,360
When you prepare for civil service exams,

177
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,240
keep an eye on the syllabus,
not on the clock.

178
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,960
This is the second time
you're revising the syllabus.

179
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,040
Papa, my science project.

180
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,400
Mummy said you'd help me with it.

181
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,400
Sit down.

182
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,760
Not now, my class is still on.

183
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,520
So when will you help me?

184
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,960
I need to go sleep.

185
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,240
Go ahead, I'll see you later.

186
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,560
Okay, guys,
only six to seven lectures more. If you study hard,
you'll ace the exams.

187
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,040
Who cares about acing the exams?

188
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,920
We just want a government job.

189
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,320
A huge house and a car with a red beacon
will be more than enough.

190
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,520
This...

191
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,640
This attitude of your generation...

192
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,320
Do you even know
what being a civil servant means?

193
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,760
If you can't do that...

194
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,880
don’t waste the position.

195
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,680
Hey, you haven’t put on your shoes yet!

196
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,160
Go get them, you will be late.

197
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,080
Run!

198
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,400
Did you put all your books in the bag?

199
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,720
Prahlad.
Where's your science project?

200
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,120
I fell asleep by
the time Papa returned.

201
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,480
Couldn’t you help him a little bit?

202
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,680
Huh?

203
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,760
My class went on till late, Sushma.

204
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,560
Anyway, he's a big boy now.

205
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,839
He can do his work. Right?

206
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,760
He does everything on his own, Ashwat.

207
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,480
He is very mature and
independent for his age.

208
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,560
He's so cooperative.

209
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,680
Can't you make some time for him?

210
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,599
I am, Sushma.

211
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,600
Go and make your bed.

212
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,680
Already done.

213
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,680
Done already?

214
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,000
Then go and fill this water bottle.

215
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,800
How long will this go on, Ashwat?

216
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,520
Do you know that they charge
tuition fees by the hour now?

217
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,680
And your class go on for
over five hours instead of two.

218
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,480
Civil examinations are tough.
I need to give my students time.

219
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,640
And Prahlad?

220
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,520
Who will be responsible
for his studies?

221
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,920
Is his father capable of paying
for his school fees, extra classes

222
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,360
IIT entrance exams
and IAS preparations?

223
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,640
He's only nine years old, Sushma.

224
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,080
I don’t believe this.

225
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,520
When it comes to his projects,
you say he is old enough.

226
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,480
And when it comes to
your responsibilities...

227
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,080
You say, "We have time!"

228
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,800
Our savings are almost over.

229
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,320
When will you take up a proper job
and stop these part-time tuitions?

230
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,840
Come here. Come here!

231
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,880
I have no idea what this burden is

232
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,080
that you're carrying
for the last three years.

233
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,840
It hasn't just affected you,
but us as well.

234
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,120
Understand your responsibilities, Ashwat.

235
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,880
Take care of your family...

236
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,360
and I'll give you a medal for it.

237
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,920
Come on, we are getting late.

238
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,120
You got yelled at because of me.

239
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,000
Okay.

240
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,840
<i>Darkness will fade away</i>

241
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,360
<i>The sun will shine</i>

242
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,440
<i>and the lotus shall bloom.</i>

243
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,160
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

244
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,680
<i>India's hopes rise as Mr. Atal Bihari</i>
<i>Vajpayee becomes the Prime Minister.</i>

245
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,640
<i>I do swear in the name of God</i>

246
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,560
<i>that I will not directly or</i>
<i>indirectly communicate or reveal to</i>

247
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,000
<i>any person or persons any matter which</i>
<i>shall be brought under my consideration.</i>

248
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,920
<i>The Vajpayee Government</i>
<i>with its cabinet of ministers</i>

249
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,760
<i>might be the answer to the problems</i>
<i>of political instability</i>

250
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,160
<i>that the country has been</i>
<i>facing for the last three years.</i>

251
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
All those who are carrying bouquets,
please leave the room.

252
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,600
In the time it has taken me
to reach my office from the car,

253
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,720
Pakistan's newly
launched Ghauri missile

254
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,000
would've destroyed
the entire city of New Delhi.

255
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,720
While Pakistan and China continued with
their numerous tests,

256
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,360
we tried to conduct one in 1995

257
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,480
which failed, by the way.

258
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,880
Does anyone remember?

259
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,760
Whoever doesn't remember, get out!

260
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,880
Mr. Tripathi, where are you going?

261
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,120
Well, I...

262
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,560
You were a part of that committee, right?

263
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,680
Let's start with you.

264
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,040
How are you ready so early today?

265
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,120
Papa helped me with
all my homework as well.

266
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,080
Really?

267
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,600
Mummy and Papa are coming home tonight.

268
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,360
Don’t forget to receive them
at the station.

269
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,000
I have received a job offer
from Delhi Open University.

270
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,880
For the Engineering Department.

271
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,040
They have called me
for an interview day after tomorrow.

272
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,120
I will go and meet them.

273
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,080
Have some yogurt and sugar.

274
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,280
Uttar Pradesh Transport

275
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,200
Gorkha School, Dehradun Cantonment

276
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,600
-Ashwat Raina?
-Yes.

277
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,840
Please come. You are...

278
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,160
Himanshu Shukla.

279
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,240
This interview is
regarding your work in 1995.

280
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,680
I don’t want to talk about it.

281
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,760
You needed my permission to get in,

282
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,320
you need the same to go out. How did your plan fail?

283
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,400
The plan that failed was not mine.

284
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,720
You should have done your homework.

285
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,480
Anyway, the floppy disk
has all the details.

286
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,280
All the files on the disk were coded.

287
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,960
No one could crack the code
or no one bothered to?

288
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,560
This is an official enquiry.

289
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,760
Please answer my questions.

290
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,680
You can't hold me responsible now.

291
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,360
What happened in 1995
was a failure for our country.

292
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,200
I've left all this behind me.

293
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,760
Anyway, your system does not appreciate
talent that I have.

294
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,080
Aren’t you Ajitabh Raina's son?

295
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,520
He was awarded a
bravery medal in that war.

296
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,560
If he were here instead of you,

297
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,080
he would have put his country first.

298
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,400
The files on this floppy can't be opened.

299
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,720
You can keep it.

300
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,560
There are two parts to this plan.

301
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,720
First are the scientists and
the engineers who build the bomb.

302
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,320
Secondly, we have the army
who install these bombs.

303
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,240
And then, there was the third part,
the most important one

304
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,040
which nobody paid attention to.

305
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,120
We were caught because
the Pokhran range is open and spread out.

306
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,360
All the preparations were made
in broad daylight.

307
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,720
Because Mr. Yadav and his team
had not read my whole plan.

308
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,560
No one bothered to open the files

309
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,360
and I wasn’t given a chance
to explain the details.

310
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,160
What was so important?

311
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,680
The American Lacrosse satellites
keep a watch on us all the time.

312
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,320
<i>These Lacrosse satellites also helped</i>
<i>America immensely during the Gulf War.</i>

313
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,400
<i>Their zoom lenses are powerful</i>

314
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,080
<i>to even read</i>
<i>the time on somebody's wristwatch.</i>

315
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,680
<i>They also use thermal imaging</i>
<i>to capture images at night.</i>

316
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,720
Nothing stays hidden from them.

317
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,080
Their vision can
penetrate through clouds.

318
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,920
So my plan was to avoid them completely.

319
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,360
How would you do that?

320
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,880
Indian Space Agency.

321
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,800
But isn't that a
civilian organization?

322
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,680
This is the only organization which
could monitor the American satellites

323
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,480
and give us a timeline
during which we could work in Pokhran.

324
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,200
My plan was to accommodate
science and common sense.

325
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,640
But nobody listened to
what I had to say.

326
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,960
India would have been
a nuclear state today.

327
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,280
We will be.

328
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,560
We are planning another test.

329
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,520
After listening to your plan, I have a
feeling we'll be successful this time.

330
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,400
The plan isn't as simple as it seems.

331
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,440
Since you aren’t interested.

332
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,760
And why would you be?

333
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,200
Anyone who takes up this job, won't get

334
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,280
any official post, salary, medal, nothing.

335
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,400
If you come across anyone
who would be interested...

336
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,920
This is not a one man's job.

337
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,920
We have to assemble
a team for this mission.

338
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,800
Go ahead.

339
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,000
Ashwat?

340
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,440
Ashwat!

341
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,840
Why are you sleeping here?

342
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,600
Why don’t you sit with Mummy
and Papa while I make breakfast?

343
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,800
Please take off your slippers.
We are watching <i>Mahabharata</i>.

344
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,320
How did only five Pandavas
manage to defeat the hundred Kauravas?

345
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,520
They took Lord Krishna's advice.

346
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,000
While there were only five Pandavas,

347
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,880
each of them had a specific goal.

348
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,000
This focus made them very powerful.

349
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,840
Powerful enough to
take on a hundred of them?

350
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,040
Yes, of course.

351
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,160
Come and sit here.

352
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,840
The eldest was Yudhishthir,
the righteous one.

353
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,960
He always took the
morally correct path.

354
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,840
Then there was Arjun, the one standing
behind Lord Krishna on the chariot.

355
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,840
He never missed his target.

356
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,560
That's how focused he was.

357
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,920
<i>And then, there was the third part,</i>
<i>the most important one</i>

358
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,840
<i>which nobody paid attention to.</i>

359
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,000
<i>Secrecy.</i>

360
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,840
Sehdev could look at the sky
and gauge what problems lay in the future.

361
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,400
Nakul was known for his good looks

362
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,080
but nothing escaped his eye.

363
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,200
Now tell me something
about Lord Krishna.

364
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,760
<i>Mahabharata</i>?

365
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,920
Pokhran is our battlefield.

366
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,240
And the satellites are the enemy,
Kauravas.

367
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,000
We need quality and not
quantity to win this war.

368
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,200
Five Pandavas were enough
to take on the hundred Kauravas.

369
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,840
Only one member will be our point
of contact from each organization.

370
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,400
Nobody else will know
anything about this mission.

371
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,160
The eldest brother....

372
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,800
BARC.

373
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,680
Bhabha Atomic Research Centre
which will provide us with the bombs.

374
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,280
Our point of contact
there will be Yudhishthir.

375
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,200
Dr. Viraf Wadia.

376
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,040
The youngest scientist
to win the Presidential award.

377
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,480
What was your inspiration
behind Nuclear Energy Research?

378
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,560
An elevator. -An elevator?
-Yes.

379
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,520
What do you mean?

380
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,280
Few years ago,
I got stuck in an elevator.

381
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,600
And I couldn’t breathe.

382
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,000
That's when I decided that this
country needs unlimited power supply.

383
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,920
Hopefully, one day, there
will be no power cuts in India

384
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,560
and no one will get stuck
in an elevator.

385
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,720
Next. Arjun.

386
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,560
Our defense lab, DRDO.

387
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,520
They will supply detonators
needed for setting off these bombs.

388
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,760
Dr. Naresh Sinha.

389
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,760
He is with the DRDO
for the last 30 years.

390
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,800
<i>Have you seen my wallet?</i>

391
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,320
I had kept it right here.
Where has it gone?

392
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,200
-Naughty!
-Your wallet!

393
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,000
It’s in your pocket and
you’ve been looking all over the place.

394
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,200
You launch huge missiles for the country

395
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,440
yet you can't remember
where you kept your wallet.

396
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,840
Have I forgotten anything else?

397
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,880
Your glasses.

398
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,400
Bheem.

399
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,720
Major Prem from the army.

400
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,040
He is already stationed
at the Pokhran range.

401
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,680
He's the most capable officer
for this mission.

402
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,440
Is this bunker at 135 degrees?

403
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,280
Major Prem?

404
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,120
Don’t you know he was a part of
our previous failed mission?

405
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,720
Failure teaches a man many things.

406
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,800
Sir, he is already aware of
the technical problems of the range.

407
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,560
Sir, haven't you given
me a second chance?

408
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,440
Puru Ranganathan.

409
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,800
From the Indian Space Agency.

410
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,760
He is the man who will make our
schedule satellite proof...

411
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,520
our Sehdev.

412
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,560
<i>He is a true patriot.</i>

413
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,400
<i>He could have taken up job offers</i>

414
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,800
<i>from many international space</i>
<i>agencies in America, Russia, Germany.</i>

415
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,520
<i>But he declined them all.</i>

416
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,800
Our last Pandava,
Nakul, Intelligence Services.

417
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,800
He will help us keep
on ground situations a secret. RAW.

418
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,120
But they are always under the radar
of the CIA and other spy agencies.

419
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,280
The security of this entire mission
depends on this man.

420
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,600
The base of our mission
will be the Pokhran Fort

421
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,600
and she will make
this place secure for us.

422
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,760
You will go there as officers
of the Archaeological Survey of India.

423
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,600
I will get the IDs ready.

424
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:29,280
Ambalika, the IDs will
not bear our original names.

425
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,639
So am I Nakul?

426
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,679
Nice name for a girl.

427
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,760
And what is your name?

428
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,120
Hmm...

429
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,400
Krishna.

430
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,719
Krishna Joshi.

431
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,560
Our guide.

432
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,159
Our leader.

433
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,760
I'll make travel and accommodation
bookings in the names of the Pandavas.

434
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,560
-It would be safe that way.
-Sir, who is this?

435
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,400
Siddhant.

436
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,560
He is a martyr.

437
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,600
But you don’t get your hopes up.

438
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,760
All the credit will go
to the scientists and engineers.

439
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,720
Sir, you might have misunderstood me.

440
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,280
This is the only place
worth visiting in this desert.

441
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,640
And they have closed
it for the public.

442
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,680
What is this country coming to?

443
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,160
Come on, move.

444
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,360
This place is closed.

445
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,800
-Let's go.
-Hey!

446
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,880
Move back.

447
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,480
Move back.

448
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,720
-Let him through.
-Move back.

449
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,800
-Move back. Move back.
-Can't you see?

450
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,240
The fort is being secured.

451
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,400
It will be done by tonight.

452
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,680
I don’t think we should secure
the guest house.

453
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,760
The locals might get suspicious.

454
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,440
Listen, I’m responsible
for your security.

455
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,960
This is what happened in 1995 as well.

456
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,640
The scientists and engineers
were accompanied by guards everywhere. Only you and I will have cell phones.

457
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,240
Is the team here?

458
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,360
It's so hot in here, how will we work?

459
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,480
This isn’t a hill station.

460
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Try being in an army bunker,

461
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,240
this cooler will feel like
an air conditioner.

462
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,000
Inspite of being a scientist,
I don't know how to operate a fax machine.

463
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,680
I don't know what the problem is.

464
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,120
Let me check,
might be some issue with the circuits.

465
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,360
Ashwat Raina.

466
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,320
Ashwat, you know everyone here.

467
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,760
Shall we start?

468
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,480
Get used to it.

469
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,440
There's a lot of dust there.

470
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,800
Pokhran range.

471
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,760
We have to test not one
but six nuclear bombs

472
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,640
in the next 30 days.

473
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,520
And that too in secret.

474
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,000
These three shafts are
already present in the range.

475
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,520
White House, Taj Mahal

476
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,880
and Kumbhkaran.

477
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,040
But they are now filled with water.

478
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,680
And it won't be easy
to remove the water

479
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,960
as they are almost 250 meters deep.

480
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,080
And what about the other three shafts?

481
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,280
We do not have time to dig new shafts.

482
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,880
which we can use.

483
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,600
They should be ready
one week before the tests.

484
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,240
So that I can assemble
the bombs in the prayer hall

485
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,920
and install them in the shafts.

486
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,960
We have to connect the bombs
to the control room with cables.

487
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,280
Inside the control room,
there will be six safety locks.

488
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,320
The plan looks easy, but it will be
difficult to keep this mission covert.

489
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,160
Three American satellites have been
hovering over us since 1995.

490
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,920
But there is a gap of a few hours

491
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,440
as these satellites swap positions.

492
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,720
During this gap, no one is able
to see what is happening on the range.

493
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,160
Every day, we will
get two such blind spots.

494
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,640
One during day,
the other at night.

495
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,360
We will do the work during
the blind spot at night.

496
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,840
It gets scorching hot during the day and
Pokhran gets lots of sandstorms. You will be given new pass codes
every day to enter the range.

497
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,840
Today's pass code.

498
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:16,520
"Embrace me
for we might never get this night back."

499
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,920
Exactly.

500
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,160
Er.. you mean,
a new pass code every day?

501
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,080
Uh-huh.

502
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,920
And you will only address
each other with your code names.

503
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,920
Remember?

504
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,880
Nakul.

505
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,840
Bheem. Yudhishthir.

506
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,800
Sehdev.

507
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,200
I am...

508
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,960
The archer..

509
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:36,920
Arjun.

510
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,680
Arjun. Yes, Arjun.

511
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,680
And remember, code names and
pass codes are extremely important.

512
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,360
There are spies everywhere.

513
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,840
We will wear army uniforms
while working on the range.

514
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,720
So that the local villagers
do not get suspicious.

515
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,400
We have ordered
uniforms for all of us.

516
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,400
It is imperative to cover the tracks
of our activity on the range.

517
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,960
So that when the second satellite
returns to the orbit

518
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,640
everything appears normal to them.

519
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,040
By the way,
do you know what Pokhran means?

520
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,560
You always wanted
to join the army, right?

521
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,160
There is something
about these uniforms.

522
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,880
Why don’t we cover ourselves
with blankets instead?

523
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,640
We are dying in the heat anyway.

524
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,680
How do I work in these loose pants?

525
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,040
Should I concentrate on
my pants or the satellites' orbit?

526
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,400
Doesn’t Major sound more senior?

527
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,360
Do you have any idea
how difficult the life of a soldier is?

528
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,360
You don’t know the significance
of these uniforms

529
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,840
which you are getting, for free.

530
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,200
-You...
-Major.

531
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,960
Please consider us as members
of your unit for the next few days.

532
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,360
We are all new to this situation.

533
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,880
We will try our best to
become worthy of this uniform...

534
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,880
by the end of this mission.

535
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,800
<i>The ground trembles</i>
<i>As we stride ahead</i>

536
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,120
<i>There is no stopping us now</i>

537
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,120
<i>Fulfilling our duties</i>
<i>With our heads held high</i>

538
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,080
<i>We refuse to bow down</i>

539
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,400
<i>The ground trembles</i>
<i>As we stride ahead</i>

540
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,840
<i>There is no stopping us now</i>

541
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,720
<i>Fulfilling our duties</i>
<i>With our heads held high</i>

542
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,680
<i>We refuse to bow down</i>

543
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:22,560
<i>For you, my motherland</i>

544
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,280
<i>I shall lay down my life for you</i>

545
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:33,280
<i>For you, my motherland</i>

546
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,160
<i>I will leave no stone unturned</i>

547
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,800
What is the pass code for today?

548
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,040
Embrace me, for we might
never get this night back.

549
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,520
Carry on.

550
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,400
<i>The ground trembles</i>
<i>As we stride ahead</i>

551
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,480
<i>There is no stopping us now</i>

552
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,720
<i>Fulfilling our duties</i>
<i>With our heads held high</i>

553
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,640
<i>We refuse to bow down</i>

554
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,640
<i>For you, my motherland</i>

555
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:12,680
<i>I shall lay down my life for you</i>

556
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,280
<i>For you, my motherland</i>

557
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,720
<i>I will leave no stone unturned</i>

558
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:34,160
<i>My dreams were fettered</i>
<i>All this while</i>

559
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,320
<i>And could not touch the sky</i>

560
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:44,720
<i>The road ahead beckons us</i>

561
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,360
<i>With renewed hope we march</i>

562
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:55,400
<i>For you, my motherland</i>

563
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,840
<i>I shall lay down my life for you</i>

564
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:06,080
<i>For you, my motherland</i>

565
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,800
<i>I will leave no stone unturned</i>

566
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,840
<i>The ground trembles</i>
<i>As we stride ahead</i>

567
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,760
<i>There is no stopping us now</i>

568
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,120
<i>Fulfilling our duties</i>
<i>With our heads held high</i>

569
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,160
<i>We refuse to bow down</i>

570
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,440
<i>The ground trembles</i>
<i>As we stride ahead</i>

571
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,440
<i>There is no stopping us now</i>

572
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,760
<i>Fulfilling our duties</i>
<i>With our heads held high</i>

573
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,000
<i>We refuse to bow down</i>

574
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,840
This thing is taking way too long
to go down.

575
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,680
All these sheets are rusted.

576
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,520
It will take us time
to get this shaft ready.

577
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,360
That's it.
We can't go any further.

578
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,080
There is a lot of water underneath.

579
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,240
Can we stop for a minute?

580
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,840
You need to be strong
if you want to move up the ranks.

581
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:33,960
Look up.

582
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,040
Keep it here.

583
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,560
At this speed, we will not
be able to pump out the water in time.

584
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,000
We need more powerful pumps.

585
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,600
But the water will
continue to flow out.

586
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,800
How do we hide this?

587
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,200
There's no need to.

588
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,640
The satellite will detect this board and assume that there is a
water supply training going on here.

589
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,720
Lower.

590
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,440
Hurry up!

591
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,520
Go back!

592
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,120
Soldiers, go toward your bunkers.

593
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,520
Otherwise, we will read
about it in tomorrow's newspaper.

594
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,400
In the past 18 hours,
there has been a lot of activity

595
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,920
going on around the range.

596
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,480
I mean there is
a lot of movement to and fro.

597
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,880
You know how powerful
the American satellites are!

598
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,080
There is nothing
going on at the range.

599
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,120
See this.

600
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,560
These people who are working
to restore the Pokhran Fort

601
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:30,720
can be seen here
again in army uniforms.

602
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,360
How?

603
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:37,480
We should go to Pokhran.

604
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,480
We have to work like this
for the next 29 days.

605
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,840
When are you going to get the stores?

606
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,360
The storekeepers have been informed.

607
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,000
I will get them on the 28th of April.

608
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,120
That's <i>Akshay Tritiya</i>,
an auspicious day.

609
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:14,920
Stores?

610
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,040
By stores, we mean bomb! Bomb!

611
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,120
How will you get them?

612
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,960
Each plutonium ball
is a bit bigger than this.

613
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,000
I could get it on a scooter.

614
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,160
You can try the scooter later.

615
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,040
For the stores,
we'll stick to the plan.

616
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,800
Major Prem has arranged
four armor-plated trucks for you.

617
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,600
You will reach BARC late at night.

618
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,400
<i>At around 2 a.m.</i>

619
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,640
<i>So that there aren’t</i>
<i>many staff members around.</i>

620
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,400
Where are you taking these packages?

621
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,440
That's all I know.

622
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,720
<i>From there,</i>
<i>you will head to Mumbai Airport.</i>

623
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,840
The unsuspecting people of this city
have no idea about this.

624
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,280
If these go off,
the entire city will be reduced to rubble.

625
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,400
Really?

626
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,440
<i>You will land at</i>
<i>Jaisalmer airport at 10 a.m.</i>

627
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,440
<i>Major Prem and Ambalika</i>
<i>will meet you at the airport.</i>

628
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,640
<i>There will be another</i>
<i>set of armor-plated trucks</i>

629
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,760
<i>ready to take the stores</i>
<i>to the range.</i>

630
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,640
The satellite blind spot
starts at 20:03.

631
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,320
The armored trucks
should not be anywhere

632
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,040
close to the range
before the blind spot starts.

633
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,320
That means we can't leave
this place before 6 p.m.

634
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,560
What will we do for so long?

635
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,120
Why don’t you
do some sightseeing in Jaisalmer?

636
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,960
<i>The roads are joyous</i>
<i>Flowers have bloomed</i>

637
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:59,680
<i>Adorned in finery, my dreams rejoice</i>

638
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,920
<i>The earth welcomes</i>
<i>The arrival of the rain clouds</i>

639
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,360
<i>Celebrate with sweets, join</i>
<i>The merrymaking, it's time to celebrate</i>

640
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:13,640
<i>These rain clouds bring</i>
<i>Showers of happiness</i>

641
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:18,440
<i>It is a day for festivities</i>

642
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:28,760
<i>It is a day for festivities</i>
<i>There is color all around</i>

643
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:33,360
<i>Happiness abounds</i>
<i>Smiles everywhere</i>

644
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,840
<i>It is a day for festivities</i>

645
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,480
<i>Call upon the moon and bring the lamps</i>
<i>Gather all the dazzling stars</i>

646
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,240
If the word gets out,
everyone will know.

647
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,120
<i>Gather all the dazzling stars</i>

648
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,240
<i>Gather all the dazzling stars</i>

649
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:06,680
<i>Gather all the dazzling stars</i>

650
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,720
<i>Let us spread happiness</i>

651
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,440
<i>Let every heart be filled with joy</i>

652
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:20,240
<i>To rejoice on this wonderful day</i>

653
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:30,400
<i>Welcome to the land of festivities</i>

654
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,280
<i>Welcome to the land of festivities</i>

655
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,640
<i>-Sing praises on this glorious day</i>
<i>-It is a glorious day</i>

656
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,440
<i>-Rejoice on this glorious day</i>
<i>-It is a glorious day</i>

657
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,440
<i>-Adorn with flowers</i>
<i>-It is a glorious day</i>

658
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,880
<i>Let us celebrate</i>

659
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:45,080
<i>It is a day for festivities</i>

660
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:49,200
<i>It is a day for festivities</i>

661
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:53,640
<i>Welcome!</i>

662
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:54,880
Wow!

663
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,400
Krishna, sir, there is a
call for you from Delhi.

664
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,440
Sir, perfect timing.
I was about to call you.

665
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:07,840
The stores are here.

666
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,440
Ashwat, stop everything for now.

667
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,560
We may not be able to conduct this test.

668
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,080
How?

669
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,360
Ashwat, I can't give you
any details right now.

670
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:07,400
<i>There has been a lot of pressure</i>
<i>on the Vajpayee government.</i>

671
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:11,000
<i>Some of the main coalition partners</i>
<i>might withdraw their support.</i>

672
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,360
<i>There was a lot of commotion in the</i>
<i>parliament today regarding the same.</i>

673
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,120
Oh yes, I remember,
for Prahlad's school.

674
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,360
What’s wrong?

675
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,160
This is the first time you're sounding
so low after going to Delhi.

676
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:29,160
You don’t sound excited about
meeting your wife and son.

677
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,640
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

678
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,800
That is not true, Sushma.
I miss both of you a lot.

679
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,640
There is a lot of
work-related stress here.

680
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,320
Teaching jobs are getting
very stressful nowadays.

681
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,160
It's not that, Sushma.

682
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:43,920
The situation here is different.

683
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,320
Yes, and you won't discuss it with me.

684
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,640
You're taking this job as seriously
as your last job,

685
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,000
like you're working for
the Prime Minister.

686
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,960
<i>I didn’t mean that.</i>

687
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,000
Ashwat.

688
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,000
<i>You've got this opportunity</i>
<i>after a long time.</i>

689
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,840
<i>Whenever it was necessary,</i>

690
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:30,080
<i>we provided a strong support to</i>
<i>the ruling party of that time...</i>

691
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,560
Do you know how serious
the situation is right now?

692
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:36,560
Coalition parties are threatening us
of withdrawing their support.

693
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,880
How will we conduct this test if
the Prime Minister is no longer in office?

694
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,520
When will they table
the no-confidence motion?

695
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,520
In two weeks.

696
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,920
What if we conduct the test
in the next ten days?

697
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,680
Look, I understand
you do not understand politics.

698
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:54,840
You should know

699
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,400
a task which seems difficult
to complete in 15 days

700
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,320
will be impossible to complete in ten.

701
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,520
I can do it.

702
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,440
Your son sacrificed
his life for the country.

703
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,560
He was not afraid of taking risks.

704
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:14,680
My son laid down his life
to uphold the country's honor

705
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,240
and you want to put
the country's honor at stake!

706
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,960
<i>I want this tradition to continue.</i>

707
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:27,440
<i>This power struggle will continue,</i>
<i>governments will come and go</i>

708
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,360
<i>political parties will keep changing,</i>

709
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:34,120
<i>but this country and its democracy</i>
<i>should march on.</i>

710
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,600
Thank God, his interview went well.

711
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,000
He knew the answers
to all the questions.

712
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,040
Hmm.

713
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,960
What hmm, Ashwat?

714
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,160
You were not paying attention.

715
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:51,040
Couldn’t you be
stress-free for one day?

716
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,000
I am sorry.
There is a problem at work so...

717
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:54,360
What work?

718
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,000
You have changed so much
because of this job.

719
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,200
What is this sound?

720
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,600
Which sound?

721
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,280
-I heard something ring...
-Prahlad!

722
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:08,880
Prahlad!

723
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,480
Come on, both of you should leave now.

724
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,080
What do you mean by leave?

725
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,120
Aren’t we going to your house?

726
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,640
Ashwat, we will get his form
in the evening.

727
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,120
We can spend some time together
till then.

728
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,080
Sushma, it will get very late
by the time you reach Mussoorie. I will collect the form
and mail it to you.

729
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,200
As it is,
it's unsafe to travel at night.

730
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,320
Come on.

731
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,680
Driver, be careful.

732
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:53,880
Ten days!

733
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:55,920
It can't be done.

734
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,000
We haven’t even finished
half the cabling yet.

735
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:03,400
It will take ages to get the approval

736
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,600
for the delivery dates
of the detonators, Akshat.

737
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,200
-Ashwat.
-Ashwat.

738
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,160
Then use your seniority.

739
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,640
The detonators should reach here
in "T minus 3" days.

740
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,760
Ashwat, we need to
put sandbags in the shafts.

741
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,080
They need to be tightly packed.

742
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,680
We were already on a tight schedule.
How can we do it any faster?

743
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:19,600
Day shift.

744
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,480
Puru, what time does the satellites’
blind spot start during the day?

745
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:23,560
It is very risky during the day.

746
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,720
Ashwat, you know
there are a lot of sandstorms

747
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,160
at the range during daytime.

748
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:31,080
It is your job to handle
such difficult situations.

749
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,240
We will conduct the tests
in ten days and that's final.

750
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:38,280
Do you know how powerful
these bombs are?

751
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,600
If these shafts are
not sealed properly,

752
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:43,280
not just Pokhran, but the entire
Rajasthan will be reduced to rubble.

753
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,320
We need hundred percent precision

754
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,240
and two hundred percent
planning in this.

755
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:50,040
We will be testing three
different bombs at the same time.

756
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,440
Ten days are enough for
your hundred percent precision

757
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:53,800
and two hundred percent planning.

758
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,440
Don’t tell me what the problem is,
find a solution.

759
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,520
Ashwat.

760
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,680
This is how the test got compromised
the last time as well.

761
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,520
Why are you giving in
to political pressure? Please don’t worry about failure.

762
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,520
If we fail this time...

763
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,120
it will be my responsibility again.

764
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,680
Take this.

765
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,280
Plug this one here
and that one there.

766
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:32,640
I am so tired.

767
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:33,640
I have never worked in so much heat.

768
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,040
Plug them in now!

769
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:58,320
Start wrapping up.

770
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,320
There are only nine days to go now.

771
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,720
I don’t think I will last that long.

772
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,520
Ashwat is making plans for my funeral.

773
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:27,200
If we keep up this speed,
we'll finish on time.

774
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,240
How much time do we have
before the satellite returns?

775
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:34,800
All the covers have been blown away.

776
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,480
The shafts,
machines, everything is visible.

777
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,640
Only five minutes are left.
Leave quickly.

778
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:42,920
What's wrong?

779
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,920
I had warned him about the sandstorms.

780
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:05,640
Hmm.

781
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:07,479
What happened?

782
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,080
What is it? Did you find something?

783
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:17,880
What did they miss?

784
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,439
This jeep is parked in
the opposite direction.

785
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:26,319
But here its direction matches
that of the other vehicles.

786
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:28,680
So?

787
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:33,920
If the jeep has moved,
where are its tire marks?

788
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:37,840
Tire marks are visible
for days in the desert.

789
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:41,920
Wow, Mr. Daniel. Well done.
That's an excellent observation.

790
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:45,160
I suggest you call the CIA right away
and tell them everything.

791
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,120
They will inform Bill Clinton,
and by tomorrow morning

792
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,520
the Indian Prime Minister
will receive a phone call.

793
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,080
And all this will stop immediately.

794
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,359
Take it easy.

795
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,720
We need more proof.
More.

796
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,960
How much more proof do you want?

797
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,000
The heat has burned my insides.

798
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:00,960
I can't even enjoy <i>chaat</i>.

799
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,800
Why are you being so dramatic?

800
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,920
Hurry up,
our night shift is about to start.

801
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,160
You sit in front of
the air conditioner all day

802
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,760
while we're toiling in the heat.

803
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,160
Make it spicy.

804
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,320
-Daniel.
-Sehdev.

805
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,440
Ah, Sehdev.

806
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:28,600
I've seen the Taj Mahal
and the Qutub Minar

807
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,640
but I am
yet to see the Pokhran Fort.

808
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,000
Yes.

809
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,760
But Ashwat's family is not here.

810
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:03,400
-What was he talking about?
-Nothing.

811
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,920
Hmm, I love spicy food.

812
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:21,720
All these names are aliases.

813
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:23,960
The five Pandavas from the <i>Mahabharata</i>.

814
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,520
Yudhishthir, Bheem, Arjun, Nakul, Sehdev.

815
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:32,880
Ashwat is the only real name,
Ashwat Raina.

816
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,280
He was a part of the
previous nuclear project.

817
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:44,840
Our Pakistani ISI
is no less than your CIA.

818
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,560
Papa, it's Ashwat.

819
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:56,800
Where are you?

820
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,920
Have you forgotten your family
after going to Delhi?

821
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,280
That's not true, Papa.

822
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:04,480
<i>Why don’t you call regularly?</i>

823
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,600
<i>Sushma worries a lot.</i>

824
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,760
<i>She is managing everything by herself.</i>

825
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,280
<i>Talk to her.</i>

826
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:12,640
<i>Sushma.</i>

827
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:13,520
<i>Yes, Papa?</i>

828
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,880
<i>Ashwat is on the line.</i>

829
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,000
Why haven’t you called
in the last two days?

830
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:22,960
I was busy at work. Double shifts.

831
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:26,080
Are you hiding something from me, Ashwat?
Huh?

832
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:29,440
There is no Engineering department
at your university

833
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,320
<i>nor do they have any</i>
<i>Ashwat Raina working for them.</i>

834
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:33,520
What's happening?

835
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,120
Did you call the university?

836
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,160
You forgot to send Prahlad's school form.

837
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:40,800
You haven’t even been
in touch for two days.

838
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,880
It’s a new department.
We have separate phone lines.

839
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,280
<i>I'll take a week off</i>
<i>and join you guys.</i>

840
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,080
The deadline is approaching,
please mail the form

841
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,480
<i>and give me their phone number.</i>

842
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:55,680
So that I can call you.

843
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,400
Sushma, I don’t remember the number.

844
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,640
There are a lot of people waiting outside.

845
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,200
But...

846
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,360
<i>He is lying to his wife as well.</i>

847
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:23,560
She thinks he is teaching
at a university in Delhi.

848
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:25,440
Hey, can you get me some onions?

849
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,080
If his wife finds out,

850
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:33,160
he is in Pokhran...

851
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,640
Then he will have
to tell her the truth.

852
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:39,960
Should we add some fuel to the fire?

853
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,160
Is this Ms. Sushma?

854
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,280
<i>Yes.</i>

855
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:50,960
Greetings, Ms. Sushma.

856
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,640
Ashwat has asked me
to mail something to you.

857
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:54,920
Yes, tell me.

858
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,960
He was in a hurry and forgot
to write down the zip code.

859
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,240
If you could tell me,
I will send it right away.

860
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,920
Just a minute, I will tell you.

861
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,920
Are you calling from
the university campus?

862
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:04,880
Campus?

863
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:07,800
No, I am calling from Pokhran,
Rajasthan.

864
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,280
From the RTDC guesthouse.

865
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:11,440
Ashwat is staying here.

866
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,480
What is he doing in Rajasthan?

867
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:21,640
He has come here with his wife
on their honeymoon.

868
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,120
You know how it is.

869
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:25,960
So what is your zip code?

870
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,240
There is no need for that. I.. I will come and collect it personally.

871
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,120
We have to repair this immediately.

872
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,840
Use more machinery.

873
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,840
What are you saying, Ashwat?

874
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,360
The generators are
already heavily loaded.

875
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,760
You know that an overload
can cause a complete blackout.

876
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:03,240
Focus on our problems,
not on our tone.

877
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:06,320
The entire mission will be compromised
because of your urgency.

878
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:33,880
I thought they'd have
a fight over the phone,

879
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:36,320
but she wants to come here.

880
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,160
Daniel, can you hear me?

881
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,040
I have cleaned your room, sir.

882
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:32,320
Do you need anything else?

883
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:34,520
No, thank you.

884
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:35,520
<i>You may leave.</i>

885
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:40,480
Listen.

886
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,840
-Yes?
-Send me a cup of tea.

887
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:46,640
Sure.

888
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:02,800
Any development?

889
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,920
Everybody is very tense, Ashwat.

890
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,680
You're pushing them too much.

891
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,840
Honestly, all of them are
very angry with you, you know.

892
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,840
It doesn’t make a difference to me.

893
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,600
But it does make a
difference to our work.

894
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:18,080
The issue with the generator is genuine. <i>You know that the White House</i>
<i>requires a lot of power.</i>

895
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,760
All right, I agree.

896
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,680
So what's your plan?
What do we do?

897
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:30,800
Okay, let's go step-by-step.

898
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:34,360
First of all...

899
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,080
You?

900
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,600
What are you doing here?

901
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:51,120
I should be asking...

902
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,120
His wife is here.

903
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:27,680
Nakul?

904
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,440
Are you even a little ashamed?

905
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:39,160
<i>You are mistaken.</i>

906
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,640
<i>I am mistaken?</i>

907
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:43,840
<i>I had no idea that you'd lie so much.</i>

908
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:49,280
This is why you didn’t take me
to your college in Delhi.

909
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:52,160
Forget about a room,
your department doesn’t exist there.

910
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:54,960
I heard...

911
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:12,320
We stay by the phone every evening
so that we don’t miss your calls

912
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,080
and you have a personal cell phone!

913
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:16,640
This is very expensive
and incoming calls are also charged.

914
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,200
What do you use this
expensive phone for?

915
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:26,760
Na... Nakul?

916
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:34,360
"The day goes by
but the night doesn't seem to end.

917
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,200
You're not around,
but your memory torments me."

918
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,760
What are you doing?
You'll break it!

919
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:39,680
You have no idea!

920
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,440
This phone has the pass code
and the time for today's blind spot!

921
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:44,600
<i>I can't tell you anything more, Sushma.</i>

922
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,320
<i>What can't you tell me?</i>

923
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:48,000
<i>What can't you tell me?</i>

924
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:55,160
You can’t tell me...
that you're bored with your mundane life?

925
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:59,720
I have done so much for you, Ashwat.

926
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:04,320
I gave you as much love
and respect as I could.

927
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:08,280
I respected your decision
of not taking up a private job

928
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:09,560
and stayed up working nights!

929
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:20,920
How long...

930
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:22,960
How long has this been going on for?

931
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:26,920
There is nothing going on, Sushma.
She is my colleague.

932
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:30,920
Enough.

933
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,280
How can she be your colleague
when you don’t even have a job!

934
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,040
Where do you work together?

935
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,600
Sushma, please listen to me.
Please.

936
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:47,640
Sushma.

937
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:02,280
What does it mean?

938
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:07,800
These guys work when the satellite
does not cover the range.

939
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:12,840
This is why your CIA was
not able to detect anything.

940
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:14,880
Call them now. How did she come here?

941
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,120
I don’t know.
She left before I could find out.

942
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,920
When was the last time
you spoke with her?

943
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Two days ago?

944
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:04,600
About Prahlad's school.

945
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,400
Did you tell her
the location by mistake?

946
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:19,200
We need to find out
how Sushma got this address.

947
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:37,640
What happened?

948
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:01,120
I had told you
that the generators might get overloaded.

949
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,800
And I had asked you to deal with it.

950
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,680
Why don’t you tell me what you want?

951
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:06,200
Arranging for it is my problem.

952
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:08,680
I need time.

953
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:14,480
Things are not going well for me.

954
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:17,840
We have been married for 11 years.

955
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:21,960
And she made such a
big accusation today.

956
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:23,880
This is a setup.

957
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:27,760
She was sent here so that they could
get more information on this mission.

958
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,400
It's fixed. Come on, start your work.

959
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:41,880
There is a satellite overhead. It could’ve been a plane.

960
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:13,160
I had seen it as well, sir.

961
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:21,040
Satellites travel like this.

962
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:23,800
And planes, like this.
What did it look like?

963
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:26,960
Another satellite was added
at the last minute.

964
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,120
That was close.
Thank God for the power failure.

965
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:33,720
Sushma's arrival,
the last minute adding of a satellite.

966
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:36,280
What is the duration of
our blind spot now?

967
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:38,760
Less than an hour.

968
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,200
At night?

969
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:42,520
In the whole day.

970
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:44,400
Just one hour's blind spot?

971
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,960
It takes an hour just
to cover up our tracks.

972
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:56,840
Send the stores back immediately.

973
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:58,880
Don’t leave any paper trail behind.

974
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:03,480
And release everyone from their duties.

975
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:40,920
Finally, some appreciation!

976
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:48,120
So, it's back to normal life
from tomorrow.

977
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,000
For the rest of you, yes.

978
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:54,160
My personal and professional lives,
both end with this mission.

979
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:56,320
We could not conduct the tests.

980
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,680
What will I tell Sushma now?

981
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,320
What was I doing here?

982
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:02,720
What is there to tell?

983
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:07,640
It’s strange that
she came to Pokhran

984
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:09,320
and couldn’t connect it
to nuclear testing. It is not her fault.

985
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:15,080
Sometimes, we get so blinded by suspicion

986
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:18,160
that we fail to see
what's right in front of us.

987
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:19,760
What did you say?

988
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:23,600
What?

989
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:24,960
What did I say?

990
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,960
Sometimes, we get so blinded by suspicion

991
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:31,360
that we fail to see
what's right in front of us.

992
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:40,120
Pass me the water.

993
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:53,840
Just listen to me once.

994
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,640
The satellites can be made to
move away from Pokhran and our range.

995
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:57,720
It's very simple.

996
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:00,720
You just have to get your strongest
sources to leak the information

997
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:04,840
that India might attack Pakistan
over the Kashmir issue.

998
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:11,320
And you know America.

999
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:15,320
As soon as they learn of our intention
to attack from the LOC,

1000
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,240
they will change the position
of their satellites.

1001
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:18,280
They will move their satellites.

1002
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:20,880
We'll conduct our tests
right under their noses.

1003
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:24,320
But for that, we need to get the army
to make mock movements at the LOC.

1004
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:30,920
You want me to create a
warlike situation in our country?

1005
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,600
Yes, sir.

1006
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:56,360
<i>The Indian Army has</i>

1007
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:59,600
<i>increased their personnel</i>
<i>in Kashmir over the last few days.</i>

1008
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:04,400
<i>This show of strength from</i>
<i>India has disturbed Pakistan.</i>

1009
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,680
<i>The Pakistani Prime Minister,</i>
<i>Mr. Nawaz Sharif</i>

1010
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:09,160
<i>is afraid that India</i>
<i>might attack the LOC any day.</i>

1011
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:23,480
<i>America has offered to mediate</i>

1012
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:25,320
<i>so that the growing tension in</i>
<i>Kashmir can be resolved.</i>

1013
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:41,320
<i>Assume not that you will</i>
<i>win Kashmir away from India</i> <i>with your jihad,</i>
<i>your weapons and your threats</i>

1014
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,240
<i>Assume not you will</i>
<i>make India bow its head</i>

1015
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:49,640
<i>in the face of your assaults</i>
<i>and your injustices</i>

1016
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:50,880
Sir, please.

1017
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:52,760
Sir!

1018
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:57,080
We know how to defend our country.

1019
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:58,960
We don’t want war.

1020
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,440
We will not retreat.

1021
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:52,360
We have to leave Pokhran.

1022
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:07,720
There were transmitters in your room.

1023
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:10,360
I have got some leads
near Khetolai village.

1024
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:13,720
There are some local spies because
of whom the mission was compromised.

1025
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,800
Why don’t you remove the
security from the guesthouse now?

1026
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:20,720
What’s your issue with security?

1027
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:23,680
We have new blind spots now.

1028
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:25,760
How much time will we get? Eight hours!

1029
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:29,320
Eight hours over the next three days?

1030
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:34,000
-To seal the shafts...
-Eight hours, every night...

1031
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:37,240
For the next three days.

1032
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:39,680
That means 24 man-hours.

1033
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:43,120
Mr. Naresh, is that time enough for you? We have laid all the cables.

1034
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:48,560
We just need to make
the final connections.

1035
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:53,360
But immediately, after these tests,
the whole world will descend upon us.

1036
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:55,320
There will be a lot of criticism.

1037
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:57,160
Mr. Naresh.

1038
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:00,480
Please don’t think
about the world.

1039
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:04,200
We are standing at a juncture

1040
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:07,120
from where we can change
the future of this country.

1041
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:10,880
Our abilities will be put to test.

1042
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:14,680
We will never seem
to have enough time.

1043
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:17,520
We will not sleep for
the next three nights.

1044
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:20,920
So that we can give our enemies
sleepless nights.

1045
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:25,160
We should not think about the outcome. We should carry out
our plans as intended.

1046
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:35,200
I don’t know...
if the world will praise us or not.

1047
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:37,720
But I am sure that...

1048
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,560
when we look at ourselves in the mirror,
we will proudly say that...

1049
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:46,880
we made the plans for the country.

1050
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:51,880
We executed the actions for the country...

1051
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:57,600
and the result we achieved
belongs to the country.

1052
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:03,760
<i>My motherland!</i>

1053
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:07,040
<i>My soul is painted</i>

1054
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:09,240
<i>My soul is painted</i>

1055
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:26,000
<i>My country is my love, my pride</i>

1056
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:30,440
<i>The skies above surrender before it</i>

1057
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:34,880
<i>My country is my love, my pride</i>

1058
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:38,600
<i>The skies above surrender before it</i>

1059
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:40,080
<i>My soul is painted</i>

1060
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:42,880
<i>My soul is painted</i>

1061
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,920
<i>My soul is painted in the saffron hue</i>

1062
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:51,400
<i>My soul is painted in the saffron hue</i>

1063
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:55,720
<i>My soul is painted in the saffron hue</i>

1064
01:32:55,800 --> 01:33:00,320
<i>My soul is painted in the saffron hue</i>

1065
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:05,600
<i>I can fight with the whole world</i>

1066
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:11,280
<i>To uphold the honor of my country</i>

1067
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:17,640
<i>My soul is painted in the saffron hue</i>

1068
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:22,080
<i>My soul is painted in the saffron hue</i>

1069
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:26,480
<i>My soul is painted in the saffron hue</i> <i>My soul is painted in the saffron hue</i>

1070
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:54,840
<i>The world will respect us</i>
<i>Such is our determination</i>

1071
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:59,200
<i>We will strive to fulfill our promise</i>

1072
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:03,680
<i>The world will respect us</i>
<i>Such is our determination</i>

1073
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:08,160
<i>We will strive to fulfill our promise</i>

1074
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:12,520
<i>We have no fear</i>
<i>Our resolve is strong</i>

1075
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:17,320
<i>Nothing can stop us now</i>

1076
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:18,920
<i>My soul is painted</i>

1077
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,640
<i>My soul is painted</i>

1078
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:25,680
<i>My soul is painted in the saffron hue</i>

1079
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:43,960
<i>I can fight with the whole world</i>

1080
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,960
<i>To uphold the honor of my country</i>

1081
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,080
What happened now?

1082
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:56,160
<i>My soul is painted in the saffron hue</i>

1083
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:58,120
The store has reached
the White House canteen.

1084
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:02,040
Which one?
The one with the hydrogen bomb?

1085
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:04,080
<i>Sir, please use code language.</i>

1086
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:05,920
This is a secure line, Ashwat.

1087
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:09,320
Otherwise,
I'll press the trigger right now.

1088
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:17,120
It's time to seal the shafts.

1089
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:33,400
<i>My soul is painted</i>

1090
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:40,720
<i>The warlike situation</i>
<i>at the border continues.</i> <i>America and the entire world</i>
<i>have their eyes on Kashmir now.</i>

1091
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:45,240
America is being fooled.

1092
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:47,600
They refuse to listen to us.

1093
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:53,320
Hey, get some onions.

1094
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:55,680
-There aren’t any.
-Why?

1095
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:57,160
It has become very expensive.

1096
01:35:57,320 --> 01:35:58,440
I will pay you extra.

1097
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:00,640
What will I do with your money
when there are no onions?

1098
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:02,080
The army has taken it all.

1099
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:03,040
What do you mean?

1100
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:05,000
They have taken truckloads of onions
to the army canteen.

1101
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:06,960
There are no onions in
the entire city of Jaisalmer.

1102
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,680
I've got the proof.

1103
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:14,960
-What proof?
-Onions.

1104
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:18,880
Onions. They absorb radiation.

1105
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:21,000
I am sure they will conduct the test soon.

1106
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:22,880
Call up the CIA.

1107
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:30,800
Your informer in Pokhran got caught.

1108
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:37,240
Daniel, you...

1109
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:48,760
<i>I don’t think mama will</i>
<i>speak to you today as well.</i>

1110
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:50,880
<i>How are you?</i>

1111
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:56,680
Mama always gives you a pep talk
before your exams, doesn't she?

1112
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,040
I also have an exam today.

1113
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,520
Are you sure she won't talk to me?

1114
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:04,360
<i>She won't, Papa.</i>

1115
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:09,080
Have yogurt and sugar.
Mom always gives you that, right?

1116
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:47,720
You?

1117
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:49,320
I am not a waiter.

1118
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:51,080
Give me your phone.

1119
01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:55,480
You won’t be able
to conduct the tests

1120
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:57,160
for which you have
been making preparations.

1121
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:58,800
The tests... are done.

1122
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:00,280
What do you mean they're done?

1123
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:01,720
Look at that painting.

1124
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:04,280
It has unhinged
because of the aftershocks.

1125
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:17,800
<i>My youth has stirred</i>

1126
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:20,920
<i>You rekindled my desire</i>

1127
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:24,120
<i>I want to get engaged to you</i>

1128
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:27,080
<i>Make me your wife</i>

1129
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:31,000
<i>My heart cries for you</i>
<i>Come to me</i>

1130
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:23,480
Give me the phone or I will shoot.

1131
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:24,600
The gun’s locked.

1132
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:29,760
The phone’s locked too.

1133
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,360
Come on, hurry up.

1134
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:10,440
Students.

1135
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:13,680
Today, I will teach you about
the importance of nonviolence.

1136
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:35,960
Hey, put the gun down.

1137
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:37,080
Sir, please listen to me.

1138
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:38,640
Arrest him. Look at the board. Put the gun down first.

1139
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:43,320
Sir, this is not my gun.

1140
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:44,760
Put it down!

1141
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:46,320
It's locked anyway, see!

1142
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:59,600
Sir, we can't wait.
We have to conduct the test right now.

1143
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:01,880
He was a Pakistani spy
and he has my phone.

1144
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:03,680
You know it has so much vital information.

1145
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:05,920
Ashwat, calm down.
I am on my way to the PMO.

1146
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:07,680
<i>I'll send you a fax as soon</i>

1147
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:09,120
<i>as I get the Prime Minister's permission,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

1148
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:10,200
Satpal, drive faster.

1149
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:11,960
What is the point
of having a red beacon?

1150
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:13,040
Defense Residential Complex

1151
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:18,240
-It was this guy, right?
-Yes, it was him. I told him.

1152
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:19,720
Aren’t you ashamed?

1153
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,280
The suspect was right in front of you
and you let him go!

1154
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:24,280
You may leave, Ashwat.

1155
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:26,840
-All right.
-Take him to the range.

1156
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:27,800
Yes, madam.

1157
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:38,040
I've got the proof.

1158
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:01,160
You know me!
I come here every day.

1159
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:02,920
I don’t have my phone
and I don’t remember the pass code.

1160
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:05,480
I give you the pass code every day.

1161
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:07,040
It's very urgent today, please.

1162
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:09,000
Sorry, sir.
You have to tell me the pass code.

1163
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:10,160
You are the one who made this rule.

1164
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:21,080
Kavita, is the Prime Minister in?

1165
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:22,480
Sir, what are you doing here?

1166
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,240
The Prime Minister has a meeting

1167
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:26,680
with the American diplomats
at Ashoka Hotel.

1168
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,680
Was it one line?

1169
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:33,760
Two.

1170
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:36,200
Love is...

1171
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:40,360
Love is not easy.
Love isn't easy, bear that in mind.

1172
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:44,760
-You know the rest.
-No, sir.

1173
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:46,440
You will have to tell me the entire thing.

1174
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:52,200
Love isn't easy, bear that in mind.

1175
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:54,800
It is a river of fire
and you have to swim through it.

1176
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:56,840
You may enter, sir.

1177
01:42:57,800 --> 01:43:00,280
Ma'am, we have tracked
the location of Ashwat's cell phone.

1178
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:02,480
-What is the location?
-Kotwal Haveli, Jaisalmer.

1179
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:29,520
The Prime Minister is set
to have a meeting

1180
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:33,800
with the American diplomats
on the rising tension in Kashmir.

1181
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:37,040
-What's going on?
-The meeting started five minutes ago.

1182
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:38,880
The Prime Minister was asking about you.

1183
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:47,960
Sir, did you get the permission?

1184
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:52,760
The Prime Minister's meeting with
the American diplomats has started.

1185
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:54,600
But sir,
that will take a couple of hours.

1186
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:57,200
I cannot bring this up
in front of the Americans!

1187
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:32,440
Open the door.

1188
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:50,920
Your Excellency.

1189
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:00,720
What is this?
The PMO has sent the wrong fax.

1190
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:21,800
White House refers to the shafts. Store refers to the bombs.

1191
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:50,720
What is wrong?

1192
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:55,520
Ashwat, the wind is
directed towards Pakistan.

1193
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:57,640
In case there is a radiation leak,
it will cause severe damage there.

1194
01:46:57,720 --> 01:46:58,600
We have to wait.

1195
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:27,880
Let's go ahead, Prem.

1196
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:29,120
We can't, sir.

1197
01:47:53,480 --> 01:47:54,360
Stop.

1198
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:56,240
Stop.

1199
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:23,800
The wind has stopped.

1200
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:24,160
Long live India!

1201
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:27,920
<i>The ground trembles</i>
<i>As we stride ahead</i>

1202
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,600
<i>There is no stopping us now</i>

1203
01:51:30,680 --> 01:51:33,240
<i>Fulfilling our duties</i>
<i>With our heads held high</i>

1204
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:35,800
<i>We refuse to bow down</i>

1205
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:39,840
<i>We refuse to bow down</i>

1206
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:44,720
<i>My motherland</i>

1207
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:50,320
<i>My motherland</i>

1208
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:08,200
<i>I am blessed to get the chance</i>

1209
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:13,000
<i>To dedicate my life to you</i>

1210
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:18,800
<i>I pray, mother, to serve you first</i>

1211
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:23,680
<i>Whenever you might call</i>

1212
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:29,120
