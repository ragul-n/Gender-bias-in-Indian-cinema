1
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:55,339
Priya, listen to me

2
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,538
Let go of me

3
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,446
You always do this,
it's always other women

4
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,002
I didn't mean to hurt you

5
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:02,602
Every time you say the same thing

6
00:02:02,867 --> 00:02:04,005
You know how much I love you

7
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:05,546
Please, listen to me

8
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,106
I love you so much

9
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:13,534
Cut!

10
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:18,569
Kaira, good for you?

11
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:43,507
Guys we'll do one more

12
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:45,271
We got this shot right?

13
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,540
We are running out of time, we don't
have permission for the whole day...

14
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,944
Kaira has a nice idea,
we'll do one more

15
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,439
What's the point of finishing
on time if we don't get a good shot?

16
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:57,309
Look, no respect for producers

17
00:02:57,567 --> 00:03:00,878
Especially these new
cameramen... sorry... women

18
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:03,172
Come on, hurry up, let's do this!

19
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,211
Fatima, we are going to change the guy

20
00:03:06,267 --> 00:03:07,109
You want the other guy?

21
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:10,207
He's got to look a little sexy

22
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,404
Get the camera

23
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:35,237
Cut!

24
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:36,104
Got that?

25
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:37,407
Fantastic!

26
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,408
Superb execution!

27
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:40,138
Good shot

28
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,806
I shot it at 48 frames,
speed up the end if you like

29
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:44,574
I'm going to take a
plate of the building now

30
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:48,369
Saw the shot Raghuvendra?

31
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:52,575
That one expression of the girl
checking out the passing guy says so much

32
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:57,176
I wish I had met Kaira earlier, I
would have shot the whole film with her

33
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:02,343
I got that

34
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:04,007
It's a wrap guys! Thank you!

35
00:04:07,267 --> 00:04:09,804
Told you, don't have to carry my bag

36
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,808
I'm so sorry

37
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:18,176
Your mom called on
my cellphone earlier...

38
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,006
you never pick up yours...

39
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:21,746
please call her back,
before you take off

40
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,270
I will, you enjoy your mini holiday

41
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:27,747
You could have enjoyed
Singapore with us...

42
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:30,270
but you wanted to
fly with someone else

43
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,243
Shut up

44
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,779
Go go

45
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:39,779
I tried to upgrade you, couldn't do it

46
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:40,937
Please

47
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:42,439
Hi guys what can I get for you?

48
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,911
Beer
- Coke

49
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:45,468
Just Coke?

50
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:50,138
I drink only on two occasions,
when I am in love and when I am not

51
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:52,434
<i>Okay...</i>

52
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,338
Cheers!

53
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:02,271
Kaira, everything okay?

54
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,209
As in we're good right?

55
00:05:04,267 --> 00:05:07,248
What are you talking about,
what happened to us?

56
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:09,407
Cheers!

57
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:21,681
Raghuvendra, I want to
shoot an entire feature film...

58
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,274
enough of this patchwork

59
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,337
I mean I can't keep waiting
for other cameramen to fall ill...

60
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:28,845
no one will even know
that I've shot this scene

61
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,403
I want to shoot my own film

62
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,678
You will

63
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:36,408
Who wouldn't want to work
with a hot DOP like you?

64
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:37,338
Hot!

65
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,743
Is that my only talent, seriously?

66
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,938
Seriously

67
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,370
Don't talk to me

68
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:45,071
Of course you're talented...

69
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:47,875
You are shooting so many
ads...earning good money

70
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:49,435
Ads and all are fine

71
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,407
I want to shoot a film

72
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:53,810
You will, you will, soon

73
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,779
And you're so young, I mean...

74
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,404
you wear zero number
glasses to look older

75
00:05:58,767 --> 00:05:59,802
Excuse me?

76
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:03,872
If actresses can be at their peak at
a young age then why not technicians?

77
00:06:03,933 --> 00:06:06,277
Have you heard of the word 'Patience'?

78
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,607
No I haven't, tell me about 'Patience'

79
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,905
Pick up...

80
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:16,878
pick up the cook's call...

81
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:20,342
if you want I can
just go and come back

82
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,308
He is not a cook,
he is the owner of a restaurant

83
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:25,313
Not even a cook?

84
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:30,976
That shot was your idea right?

85
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:34,310
Girl with guy, checking out other guy?

86
00:06:34,633 --> 00:06:37,375
Inspired from life?

87
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,102
Listen Kaira...

88
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:43,974
you take my seat, I'll take yours...

89
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,272
I can sit in Economy class,
no need to sacrifice

90
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:50,177
Your long legs won't
fit in there anyway

91
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:51,168
That is true

92
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:52,234
It is very true

93
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,347
Yes Mom, it was good

94
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:59,914
Can't talk now,
the plane is going to take off

95
00:06:59,967 --> 00:07:01,002
Bye!

96
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,043
So...

97
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,238
can I come up?

98
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,075
I'm really tired

99
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:50,111
Dinner?

100
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,078
I'm busy, but I'll see you

101
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:02,907
Alka!

102
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,035
<i>Didi! (Sister)</i>

103
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:06,469
You've become so fat!

104
00:08:09,467 --> 00:08:10,104
L-low was your flight'?

105
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:25,774
Your mother called 3 times

106
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:35,205
You are so sweet Alka

107
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:36,810
Thank you!

108
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,843
Do you want coffee
or shall I serve breakfast?

109
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:42,645
Later

110
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,679
Didi...

111
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:52,742
this guy is so cute

112
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,738
Was cute!

113
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:56,571
Was!

114
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:59,044
I don't find him cute anymore...

115
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,637
just take down his photo

116
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,011
I just put it all in perfect order

117
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,471
Now it's perfect

118
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:42,674
So then, how was your trip'?

119
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,039
It was good

120
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:46,073
Just good?

121
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:48,912
Okay, great

122
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:56,910
You look beautiful sweetheart

123
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:12,673
Sorry, I'll just...

124
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:17,478
No it's okay, go ahead

125
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:19,910
Table for 4 please?

126
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:22,504
I'm sorry guys,
we have a strict dress code

127
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:23,773
No shorts and slippers please

128
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,608
Come on, it's his birthday

129
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:26,805
I'm sorry, wish I could

130
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:29,739
But she's wearing shorts!

131
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,939
It's okay for girls, I'm sorry guys

132
00:10:49,433 --> 00:10:52,573
Just this once, only for you

133
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:58,808
Next time I'll come along
on shoot with you, as your caterer

134
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:00,803
What do you say?

135
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,341
I slept with Raghuvendra

136
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,476
I should go...

137
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,874
Sid...

138
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:50,378
I'm sorry

139
00:12:58,467 --> 00:13:00,344
What are you doing!

140
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:14,447
It's all good!

141
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,712
It's okay, it's all good...

142
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,903
Hey look, Sid!

143
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,508
Shit! Where?

144
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,641
That's not Sid, Jackie

145
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,871
He looked so much like him...cute

146
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:45,838
Poor thing, nice guy he was

147
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,504
Really nice

148
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:49,911
Little too nice for you right?

149
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,779
Oh my God! This jacket!

150
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,181
It reminds me of school,
our 'Famous Five' gang

151
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:03,778
Was that the 8th or 9th grade?

152
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,143
10th grade, same one

153
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,680
See, I can have a long
term relationship too

154
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:11,406
Yes, with things

155
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:13,346
So are we things too?

156
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,437
Yes, you are a thing

157
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:17,802
Sorry

158
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:20,643
Have you gone blind in love?
Am I invisible?

159
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,872
We said sorry

160
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,838
Staring into her eyes!

161
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,844
They are a couple

162
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,779
'Oh my coochie coo'
'So sweet I love you'...

163
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,313
The same rubbish crap it's irritating

164
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:33,778
What are you doing?

165
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:35,841
Go to hell!

166
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:40,178
Stupid! Hate couples!

167
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:50,246
Are you guys here to help
me or to do a comedy show?

168
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,210
Both

169
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:54,373
Guys I have a deadline, I have
to show the director the costumes

170
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:55,571
Fine

171
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,437
Raunak do you need help?

172
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,208
Listen, I've to go,
I have my 'BD' appointment

173
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:02,405
What's this 'BU?

174
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:04,208
'Brain Doctor', my therapist

175
00:15:04,267 --> 00:15:07,248
Oh 'BD'... Raunak you're
still going to that 'BU?

176
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,176
I have to

177
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:10,770
'Brain Doctor'?
Why are you seeing a therapist?

178
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:11,777
Are you mad?

179
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:14,272
Who isn't? Look at him

180
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,577
That's a cut, nice

181
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:27,636
<i>Good for you Kara?</i>

182
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,770
Good for me

183
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:33,638
<i>Rubbish I
can direct better than this!</i>

184
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:50,069
Tell me something...

185
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:54,437
Why did you start
seeing your therapist?

186
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,646
So that you could
tell everyone you're gay?

187
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:01,407
<i>No</i>

188
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:06,143
So that I could tell myself, I'm gay

189
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:15,273
When is your flight to Goa?

190
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:18,780
Don't remind me I can't
believe I'm going to Goa

191
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:22,242
You're the first human
being who's saying this so sadly

192
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,741
It's Goa! Enjoy

193
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:26,311
Shut up

194
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:27,773
And yes it is sad...

195
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:29,546
Because I'm going on duty

196
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:32,511
Every 2-3 months
have to go show my face

197
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,778
Raghu?

198
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:36,273
Duty!

199
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:39,577
Yes mom, I'm coming tomorrow

200
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:44,043
What's with this food every time!

201
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:48,309
Make what you like,
don't ask me I'm busy

202
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,704
Mothers! Same standard
question every time...

203
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:55,474
'What will you eat' 'What to make'

204
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:58,480
Either she isn't my real
mother or she's had a memory loss

205
00:16:58,533 --> 00:16:59,341
Kaira!

206
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,505
At least eat my food...

207
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:03,476
Only way to handle the torture...

208
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:06,241
I think this time I'll
work on my short film

209
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,438
Short film

210
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:11,038
The longest project of this century

211
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:12,043
That's so bitchy

212
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:12,634
It's true

213
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,577
l-low do you like my French food'?

214
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,373
Landlord? I'm not answering

215
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:19,175
I don't know about French
food but this dip is amazing

216
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:21,213
Full Indian spice, try it

217
00:17:21,267 --> 00:17:24,976
The dip is from Kaira's fridge
I have made the puff pastries

218
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:28,473
Jackie, at last you made something

219
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:30,035
What do you mean, at last?

220
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:33,703
You film people think that
only you do important work...

221
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:35,537
and the rest of us are useless?

222
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:38,570
I have decided to work on myself

223
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:41,011
That's tough work

224
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,306
Do n, do it

225
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,938
What's wrong with you?

226
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,206
I'm not going to Goa

227
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,075
Guess what?

228
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:51,374
'Raghu' your friend called...

229
00:17:51,433 --> 00:17:55,210
and I have to shoot
a music video here in 3 days

230
00:17:55,267 --> 00:17:56,075
Now get ready

231
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:56,508
<i>0K6'!</i>

232
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:59,275
I have never seen anybody
so excited not going to Goa

233
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,870
No Goa

234
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,404
What happened to her?

235
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:11,135
It's not because of my food

236
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,644
Okay everybody,
just get away from the table

237
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,208
This food is contaminated

238
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,311
<i>Hey Fats.</i> . <i>.you good?</i>

239
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:21,902
<i>Koko</i>

240
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:22,274
Yes

241
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,471
Guess what?

242
00:18:24,133 --> 00:18:25,043
What's up?

243
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,440
I'm pregnant!

244
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,410
What?

245
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:29,241
It wasn't Jackie's food

246
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,873
Oh my God Fatty! Congratulations!

247
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:34,578
I mean we're supposed
to be happy right?

248
00:18:34,867 --> 00:18:38,144
I don't know...
I want to throw up right now

249
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:44,109
Should I go?

250
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:45,145
Yes please

251
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:47,137
No I'm just kidding

252
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:48,910
I'm just very excited

253
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:50,512
Are you pregnant too?

254
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:55,179
So I was working on a co-production
with this New York film company...

255
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:56,571
and it has come through

256
00:18:58,867 --> 00:18:59,868
Thank you

257
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,938
Wow, you are going to be
shooting a feature in the US?

258
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,501
Yes

259
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,108
Tell me more...good script?

260
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:05,872
Superb

261
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:08,140
Are you going to be
filming 'in' New York?

262
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,009
You are going to
be filming in New York

263
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,340
As in 'we' are going
to be filming in New York

264
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:17,979
If you're not available
we'll get another camera person...

265
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:20,138
Oh my God...l will kill you!

266
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:24,843
Told you, not going to Goa is lucky

267
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:28,080
Lucky for you, unlucky for me...

268
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,108
I want to kill my husband...

269
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:32,176
You're sure right?

270
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:35,442
It's not because
you think I'm hot right?

271
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:38,277
Obviously... you think
it's because you're talented?

272
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:44,238
What's wrong with your head?
Why are you so complicated?

273
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,280
You're the best,
that's why you got the job...

274
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,311
Simple

275
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,271
Thank you, appreciate it

276
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,241

00:21:57,867 --> 00:21:59,972
You'll also get to spend
time with Raghu also...

298
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:02,843
when you're in New York,
shooting for 3 months

299
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,709

Oh sorry two gents

302
00:22:07,933 --> 00:22:11,312
Can I steal Kaira for a minute?

303
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:14,109
Thief! Even we want to hear

304
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:14,702

00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,938
Even we want to hear!

306
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,843
What? I can't hear anything

307
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,972
Okay pose

308
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,743
Nice one

309
00:22:30,967 --> 00:22:33,004
So I'm off to New York tonight

310
00:22:33,733 --> 00:22:34,177
What?

311
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:35,211
Yes

312
00:22:35,433 --> 00:22:38,414
The financiers want to meet urgently

313
00:22:40,033 --> 00:22:42,877
Someone has to fly so that you can

314
00:22:44,167 --> 00:22:47,740
OK go, fly...

315
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,369
Have a nice flight

316
00:22:49,433 --> 00:22:50,377
That's it?

317
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:53,007
Have a nice flight?

318
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:54,434
What else do I say?

319
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,737
Say something

320
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,371
You pulled me here,
you say something

321
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,806
Firstly stop looking so hot

322
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:04,769
Tie your hair up

323
00:23:09,267 --> 00:23:11,338
And behave yourself,
just for two weeks

324
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:14,943
Here you g0, haPPW'

325
00:23:15,267 --> 00:23:16,109

326
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:17,077
l-low do I look'?

327
00:23:17,133 --> 00:23:18,908
Lovely

328
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:23,805
So I had to talk to
you about something...

329
00:23:25,233 --> 00:23:27,110
Do you want to hit the dance floor?

330
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:29,207
<i>Hi Justin Bieber</i>

331
00:23:30,067 --> 00:23:32,104
We're just in the
middle of a conversation

332
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:38,139
Anyway, you were saying

333
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,077
I was saying that...

334
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:42,968
Gautami...

335
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:43,702
Who?

336
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,974
Gautami Sharma will be
the line producer of the film...

337
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,972
OK, so?

338
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,337
The financiers have recommended her...

339
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,375
they think she is the
best person for this job

340
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,079
What are you trying to say?

341
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,672
Gautami and I, many years ago...

342
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,642
were in a relationship

343
00:24:06,867 --> 00:24:10,110
Okay, it's a reunion! That's amazing

344
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,708
Reunion my foot...

345
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,212
It's going to be a
really awkward situation

346
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:17,180
I mean she was such a weird one...

347
00:24:17,233 --> 00:24:18,906
I don't even feel like seeing her

348
00:24:19,867 --> 00:24:25,044
I just want the job to go smoothly,
and I thought you should know

349
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:27,908
Cool, whatever

350
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,273
What Whatever'? Come here...

351
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,141
Anyway I've had someone else
on my mind for a while now

352
00:24:47,967 --> 00:24:49,742
Look I think...

353
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:55,848
it's time that we got
serious about each other

354
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,905
I think it's time that you go

355
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:03,140
Do you want to miss your flight?

356
00:25:04,034 --> 00:25:06,776
Kaira I'm serious, I'm not kidding

357
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,902
We really should...

358
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:17,113
We have a flight to catch...

359
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:18,202
It's late

360
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:20,139
Okay 0K3)'

361
00:25:20,233 --> 00:25:24,477
Go, it's okay, it's cool

362
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:25,535
Really?

363
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:28,078
You don't have anything to say?

364
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:32,505
No, that's it for now

365
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:34,046
Bye

366
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,110
What did I miss?

367
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:39,202
Shots!

368
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,677
<i>So, let's break up</i>

369
00:26:16,767 --> 00:26:18,644
<i>Oh my dear</i>

370
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:20,144
<i>Let's break up</i>

371
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,778
<i>Oh please say yes</i>

372
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,439
<i>You and I will never work out,
oh let me go</i>

373
00:26:44,433 --> 00:26:45,912
<i>When I see</i>

374
00:26:46,467 --> 00:26:47,969
<i>A beautiful girl</i>

375
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,677
<i>I get excited</i>

376
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,104
<i>Basically basically basically</i>

377
00:26:54,933 --> 00:26:56,105
<i>I</i> 'm a rascal

378
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,405
<i>But you're no less baby</i>

379
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,108
<i>Somedays youTe nice</i>

380
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:05,903
<i>Somedays youTe crooked</i>

381
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,642
<i>Basically basically basically.</i> ..

382
00:27:08,734 --> 00:27:12,045
You're a rascal too

383
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:40,447
Koko, why don't you think
seriously about Raghuvendra?

384
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,845
He is so right for you...

385
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,939
This is why some
people should not drink

386
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:49,910
Why should she think
about Raghuvendra?

387
00:27:49,967 --> 00:27:51,742
Is he the last man in the world?

388
00:27:51,867 --> 00:27:54,006
Why shouldn't she consider him?

389
00:27:54,467 --> 00:28:01,544
I will tell you point by point why
Raghuvendra is the perfect guy for Koko

390
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,507
Point no. 1...

391
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,476
And this is the most
important point in the world

392
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:10,406
He is good looking

393
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:15,974
Hardly two percent of people
in the world look good...

394
00:28:16,367 --> 00:28:18,711
and if you have to spend
your life with somebody...

395
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,942
every morning you should
at least see a handsome face

396
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,940
Point no. 2...

397
00:28:25,634 --> 00:28:27,875
He has a great sense of humour...

398
00:28:28,634 --> 00:28:32,548
and more laughter means more sex

399
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,604
Where are you getting
this information?

400
00:28:36,267 --> 00:28:37,940
Point no. 3...

401
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:42,342
He understands your profession

402
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:47,710
If you marry a software
engineer or a farmer...

403
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,871
what will you discuss at dinner?

404
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:52,311
Virus or cow dung?

405
00:28:52,367 --> 00:28:54,347
Hello, my husband
is a software engineer

406
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,504
And we have many
interesting discussions

407
00:28:57,567 --> 00:28:58,272
Like what?

408
00:28:58,433 --> 00:28:59,844
Like a lot of things

409
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,380
And I'm sure farmers
are interesting too...

410
00:29:02,434 --> 00:29:04,778
they can tell us
about organic vegetables

411
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:07,575
They can tell you
where to get cow's milk

412
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,402
Go, marry a farmer

413
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:12,776
Ganju, tell them I'm right

414
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:15,814
Yes, please give us
your male point of view

415
00:29:15,867 --> 00:29:18,575
Guys, just shut up

416
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:20,271
This is all pointless

417
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:25,544
He's going to meet his
ex-girlfriend in New York

418
00:29:25,767 --> 00:29:29,681
E><-girlfriend! That's just great

419
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:33,906
Ex is an ex, that's in the past

420
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,837
Just punch her

421
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,507
No, the important question is...

422
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:42,875
are you his present?

423
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,473
William Faulkner once said...

424
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:50,540
"The past is never dead,
in fact it's not even the past"

425
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:53,905
What?

426
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,301
<i>Your 'BU taught you “is?</i>

427
00:29:55,367 --> 00:29:57,904
Hey I want to go to this 'BD'

428
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:26,403
<i>Raguu!</i>

429
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,608
Take it take it...

430
00:30:29,567 --> 00:30:32,309
No I don't need it

431
00:30:32,367 --> 00:30:35,678
<i>Stop acting pricey...
1 know you like Raguu</i>

432
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,974
No, I don't

433
00:30:38,567 --> 00:30:43,983
Take it, keep it, very tasty so yum

434
00:30:44,233 --> 00:30:46,474
Yuck Jackie, so cheap

435
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:49,737
<i>I love the taste of Raguu</i>

436
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:51,844
Have you gone mad?

437
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,511
Limited offer, grab now

438
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,311
You've gone mad

439
00:31:06,133 --> 00:31:07,373
Pasta!

440
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,239
<i>No don 'I be so desperate,
let him call</i>

441
00:31:31,434 --> 00:31:33,607
New photo?

442
00:31:35,267 --> 00:31:36,871
Yes, nice?

443
00:31:39,533 --> 00:31:41,376
Eat quickly, it will get cold

444
00:31:43,733 --> 00:31:46,373
<i>Raguu Raguu Raguu.</i> ..

445
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:50,313
Just crush the blacks

446
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,311
More...

447
00:31:54,867 --> 00:31:55,868
See...

448
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:03,539
Let's Play

449
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:07,305
Much better see...

450
00:32:07,367 --> 00:32:08,573
Yes, it's looking nice

451
00:32:08,733 --> 00:32:11,304
Okay now pause and zoom in

452
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:15,506
Ganju! I told you to remind me at 3 PM

453
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:18,104
I had to take Fatty to the doctor

454
00:32:18,767 --> 00:32:22,180
Fatty! I'm so sorry, I'm just leaving

455
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:26,478
<i>No, you wait I'm coming there,
to eat the canteen Veda Pav</i>

456
00:32:26,533 --> 00:32:28,535
My doctor's appointment got cancelled

457
00:32:33,634 --> 00:32:35,341
This landlord...

458
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:37,271
Hello...

459
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:41,077
What?

460
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:44,608
You are not going to believe this

461
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,512
Being single is now a crime!

462
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:49,438
What?

463
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,107
My landlord is kicking
me out of my apartment!

464
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:53,845
What?

465
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,081
I'm going to join the
ranks of homeless in Mumbai

466
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,811
And you want to know why?

467
00:32:59,067 --> 00:33:00,512
Did I damage the apartment? No!

468
00:33:00,567 --> 00:33:02,444
Did I forget to pay rent? No!

469
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,242
The building committee
just got together and decided...

470
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,143
that only married couples
and families can live there

471
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,372
Is that even legal?

472
00:33:09,034 --> 00:33:10,138
This just happened?

473
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,146
Yes he just called!

474
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,407
I've been avoiding his calls for days

475
00:33:14,467 --> 00:33:17,311
Gosh Fatty, I have to vacate
by the end of the month...

476
00:33:17,367 --> 00:33:18,243
I don't know what to do

477
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,007
Damn these people

478
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:24,047
Mumbai, India's most
modern cosmopolitan city

479
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,440
Seriously

480
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:29,448
Listen, you know you can stay with me

481
00:33:30,067 --> 00:33:32,377
That's not the point

482
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:36,303
In a way, thank God...

483
00:33:36,733 --> 00:33:41,239
thank God I'm leaving this city
and this country for this project...

484
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,241
But seriously what thinking

485
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,247
No marriage means no home for women?

486
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:51,713
Why don't they make this lavv instead 'no
staying with your in-laws after marriage'?

487
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,204
Forget it

488
00:33:58,167 --> 00:34:02,138
So, when is the New York shoot?

489
00:34:02,433 --> 00:34:03,537
I don't know

490
00:34:03,633 --> 00:34:06,546
I will know the exact
dates in a month...

491
00:34:06,967 --> 00:34:08,537
when the man returns

492
00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:10,271
The man has not called?

493
00:34:11,067 --> 00:34:13,047
Raghuvendra has not called?

494
00:34:13,367 --> 00:34:14,402
<i>No</i>

495
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:21,009
What 'hmm'?

496
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,944
Why you looking so suspicious?

497
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,602
Fatty? Tell me

498
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,543
He got engaged

499
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,604
He got engaged!

500
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,306
I'm sorry, who got engaged?

501
00:34:39,033 --> 00:34:40,307
Raghuvendra

502
00:34:41,067 --> 00:34:42,205
When?

503
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,202
Last week

504
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,674
Last week?

505
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,470
L-le was just here,
I mean, he just left...

506
00:34:50,533 --> 00:34:51,477
I know...

507
00:34:51,534 --> 00:34:54,014
Who told you? Hovv do you know?

508
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,273
Ajay, that guy from production...

509
00:34:56,467 --> 00:34:59,505
Just one second...
he's not even messaged...

510
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,204
Who told you?

511
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:04,339
Ajay, from production,
he went to New York with Raghuvendra

512
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,277
He got engaged?

513
00:35:07,934 --> 00:35:10,210
I don't believe this to whom?

514
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,507
Just please, one second, how can he'?

515
00:35:13,434 --> 00:35:14,276
Koko...

516
00:35:14,334 --> 00:35:16,575
God! This is just getting worse

517
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:39,002
You okay?

518
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,970
It's just the chilli

519
00:35:47,867 --> 00:35:49,904
You want to know to whom?

520
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:54,877
<i>No</i>

521
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,377
Okay playback

522
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,004
Sorry it slipped

523
00:36:47,967 --> 00:36:50,243
<i>Where do I go from here</i>

524
00:36:50,933 --> 00:36:53,209
<i>Where do I hide</i>

525
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,107
<i>This half heart</i>

526
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,144
How do <i>I</i> share?

527
00:36:59,734 --> 00:37:02,112
<i>We parted from myself</i>

528
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:05,038
<i>Pm separated from myself</i>

529
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:08,007
<i>This half heart</i>

530
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,803
<i>How do I settle?</i>

531
00:37:11,267 --> 00:37:13,474
<i>Oh hurting heart</i>

532
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:20,171
<i>Oh Dying heart</i>

533
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:26,139
<i>Oh broken heart</i>

534
00:37:28,934 --> 00:37:31,141
<i>What's your problem</i>

535
00:37:31,967 --> 00:37:34,243
<i>Oh heart, just go to he“</i>

536
00:37:37,367 --> 00:37:41,509
<i>Just go to he“, Oh heart</i>

537
00:37:56,967 --> 00:38:01,438
<i>Just go to he“, Oh heart</i>

538
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,074
I don't believe this

539
00:38:04,134 --> 00:38:07,013
Back to Goa, back to square one

540
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,211
It's just for 1 month...

541
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:12,348
then the New York shoot will start...

542
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,405
won't it?

543
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,040
I don't know...

544
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,281
Personal and professional...

545
00:38:19,334 --> 00:38:22,713
always keep it separate

546
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,278
You always say this

547
00:38:24,334 --> 00:38:26,143
When will you ever use this?

548
00:38:26,933 --> 00:38:28,879
Such strange things you buy

549
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:31,244
Damn, I have to live
with my parents for a month

550
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,007
l-low am I going to do it'?

551
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:34,835
Stay with me...

552
00:38:34,967 --> 00:38:36,412
I'm also going to be in Goa

553
00:38:36,834 --> 00:38:38,108
We'll do yoga together

554
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:41,205
Do yoga in your fancy holiday house...

555
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,213
I wish my parents would
buy me a villa in Goa

556
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,804
Guess what?

557
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:51,347
When I reach Goa, I have
to do a beautiful shoot for my dad

558
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:54,040
Uncle also joined the film business?

559
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,374
No Jackie...

560
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:58,903
he wants me to shoot a promotional
video for his friend's restaurant...

561
00:38:58,967 --> 00:38:59,843
Who knows?

562
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,240
This could be the
turning point in my life

563
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:14,678
<i>Are you my fault</i>

564
00:39:14,733 --> 00:39:17,111
<i>Or your own mistake</i>

565
00:39:17,867 --> 00:39:20,108
<i>Shamed heart</i>

566
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:23,610
<i>Please tell me so</i>

567
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,178
<i>What do we gain now</i>

568
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,213
<i>What do we lose now</i>

569
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,146
<i>Shamed heart</i>

570
00:39:32,634 --> 00:39:35,240
<i>Crying is no use</i>

571
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,247
<i>Oh hurting heart</i>

572
00:39:41,134 --> 00:39:47,107
<i>Oh Dying heart</i>

573
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:52,674
<i>Oh broken heart</i>

574
00:39:52,734 --> 00:39:55,715
<i>What's your problem</i>

575
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:59,340
<i>Oh heart, just go to he“</i>

576
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:01,679
So Koko

577
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,609
Have you met 'Salman Khan' yet?

578
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:05,710
Oh my God, 'Sallu'!

579
00:40:05,867 --> 00:40:08,746
Is he so handsome in real life?

580
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,244
Does he actually have a 6 pack?

581
00:40:11,767 --> 00:40:13,769
Or is that just how
it looks on screen'?

582
00:40:14,067 --> 00:40:16,638
Tell me Koko, I'm dying to know

583
00:40:16,934 --> 00:40:18,675
First of all,
I haven't met your 'Sallu'...

584
00:40:18,733 --> 00:40:20,041
and if I ever meet him...

585
00:40:20,134 --> 00:40:21,044
I'm not going to tell him...

586
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,741
'Take off your shirt
I want to see your 6 pack abs'

587
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,642
Exactly

588
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:29,374
Tell us about your ad with 'Dhoni'

589
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,770
One second dad

590
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,281
'Salman Khan'? Abs? Really?

591
00:40:38,067 --> 00:40:41,105
Stop bugging her...

592
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,343
talk about the main topic

593
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:51,677
Yes Ashu,
she should be doing a proper job...

594
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:53,175
in an office...

595
00:40:53,634 --> 00:40:56,114
something more respectable

596
00:40:56,667 --> 00:40:59,546
That's when we can talk to
people seriously about marriage

597
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,306
Why will she do some otherjob?

598
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,180
She's done a cinematography
course in New York

599
00:41:05,634 --> 00:41:08,114
She is brilliant at her
job and she's still young

600
00:41:08,167 --> 00:41:10,010
She won't be young forever...

601
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:12,547
all the good boys will be taken

602
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,602
That's my biggest worry you know...

603
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,878
come baby...

604
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,278
So Kaira, tell me...

605
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:30,907
Are you a...

606
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:33,877
Are you a Lebanese?

607
00:41:37,867 --> 00:41:42,009
It's not Lebanese', it is lesbian!

608
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:48,580
Yes, are you a Lesbian'?

609
00:41:59,034 --> 00:42:00,479
Oh my God...

610
00:42:00,634 --> 00:42:04,878
If I were, would that stop
you from talking about marriage?

611
00:42:05,067 --> 00:42:08,947
Even if you are,
it won't make a difference...

612
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,671
all this gay stuff is
cool in the film industry

613
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,106
You're right...

614
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:15,670
from big stars to spot boys,
everyone's gay...

615
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,470
we call it 'Gollyvvood' now

616
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,704
Really?

617
00:42:19,067 --> 00:42:20,137
Really?

618
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,043
Of course not!

619
00:42:22,934 --> 00:42:25,471
Do you people even
listen to yourselves?

620
00:42:25,534 --> 00:42:27,138
It's such rubbish

621
00:42:27,767 --> 00:42:30,509
The film industry doesn't have more
gay people, it's just more accepting...

622
00:42:30,634 --> 00:42:34,980
there must be many gay
people in your office too...

623
00:42:35,634 --> 00:42:37,978
but sadly they have to hide the fact

624
00:42:40,234 --> 00:42:44,580
So, are you?

625
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,001
A 'lesbd?

626
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,980
No, unfortunately not

627
00:42:55,034 --> 00:42:58,481
So why don't you settle down?

628
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,413
We're just worried about you Koko

629
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,440
If you keep hanging
with these filmy men...

630
00:43:04,567 --> 00:43:06,547
how will you find a nice boy'?

631
00:43:06,733 --> 00:43:11,512
Filmy men are okay for checking
out abs, but not okay to marry?

632
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,110
L-low much junk you Keep eating

633
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,480
I've made all this for you...

634
00:43:16,534 --> 00:43:17,171
eat this

635
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,947
For me? Have you
ever seen me eat this?

636
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,637
<i>I thought you like paneer...</i>

637
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,545
you used to eat it...

638
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,814
that's why I keep
asking what you want...

639
00:43:30,867 --> 00:43:32,540
anyway, dinner is put...

640
00:43:35,467 --> 00:43:37,640
come baby, come...

641
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,509
You know Koko

642
00:43:49,567 --> 00:43:53,071
getting married before 25...

643
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,045
can reduce the divorce rate by 50%

644
00:43:59,367 --> 00:44:02,075
There is a 100% chance
of not getting a divorce...

645
00:44:03,467 --> 00:44:04,946
...by not getting married

646
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,002
I'm going to stay with Jackie

647
00:44:07,967 --> 00:44:09,002
Koko?

648
00:44:16,067 --> 00:44:21,608
<i>Pm addicted to pain</i>

649
00:44:21,967 --> 00:44:26,973
<i>Even my tears, laugh at me</i>

650
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:32,573
<i>Why do I give myself new scars</i>

651
00:44:32,934 --> 00:44:39,010
<i>Somebody save me from myself</i>

652
00:44:40,067 --> 00:44:42,946
What about the New York project...

653
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,646
What is this question,
'did you sleep well'?

654
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,611
If I say no what can you do?

655
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:36,978
I don't care what people think...

656
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:39,514
I'm not going to stay
with you for other people...

657
00:45:40,934 --> 00:45:43,346
don't irritate me please

658
00:45:44,034 --> 00:45:46,014
'Good morning' is it?

659
00:45:48,367 --> 00:45:50,278
Now it's a 'good morning'...

660
00:45:50,867 --> 00:45:52,813
If your night is not good...

661
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,811
how will your morning be good'?

662
00:45:54,967 --> 00:45:56,776
I think I should
be a night watchman...

663
00:45:56,867 --> 00:45:59,279
Should I take an
appointment with a doctor?

664
00:46:02,434 --> 00:46:03,242
Who is that?

665
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:07,806
He moved here a few weeks ago,
to write...

666
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,501
Nice gUY

667
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,643
Take an appointment with him

668
00:46:14,967 --> 00:46:17,538
There she is, my talented daughter...

669
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,610
She shoots with all
'Bollywood' celebrities

670
00:46:20,867 --> 00:46:20,969
Really?

671
00:46:22,467 --> 00:46:23,946
I know this is a small job for you...

672
00:46:24,234 --> 00:46:27,443
but this new restaurant
video is very important for us...

673
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,808
thank you so much for doing this

674
00:46:28,867 --> 00:46:29,971
No, it's cool

675
00:46:30,267 --> 00:46:32,713
Actually we should start,
the camera setup will take a while

676
00:46:32,767 --> 00:46:35,338
Yes, she is very professional

677
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,778
During work, only work, nothing else

678
00:46:37,834 --> 00:46:38,744
Dad!

679
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:41,210
Can we stop all these
useless formalities?

680
00:46:41,267 --> 00:46:41,972
I need to get this done

681
00:46:42,234 --> 00:46:43,611
I only have a day

682
00:46:45,667 --> 00:46:47,305
Get the 24-70

683
00:46:47,367 --> 00:46:48,744
Tried everything Ganju...

684
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,542
even sleeping pills, nothing works

685
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,440
Try 'Reiki'...
my grandmother also tried it

686
00:46:56,367 --> 00:46:57,778
Shut up and setup

687
00:46:58,234 --> 00:47:00,339
Remove all this,
what's all this rubbish...

688
00:47:04,634 --> 00:47:07,240
I am sorry,
this can't be moved right now...

689
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,779
only after this session ends

690
00:47:08,834 --> 00:47:09,778
What?

691
00:47:09,867 --> 00:47:12,313
We have to wait? Then why call us?

692
00:47:12,367 --> 00:47:13,675
Ma'am, the session is going on

693
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,245
Madness!

694
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,638
National Convention for
Mental Health Awareness...

695
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,609
it's a festival for therapists...

696
00:47:20,667 --> 00:47:23,477
RaunaKs playground...should we go in?

697
00:47:23,534 --> 00:47:25,241
Shut up and sit

698
00:47:28,467 --> 00:47:29,241
Here?

699
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:30,301
Just sit

700
00:47:40,867 --> 00:47:43,177
I've done a shot breakdown,
you want to see?

701
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,378
I'm sleeping

702
00:47:44,434 --> 00:47:47,779
<i>Dr. Chopra,
therapy, counselling, analysis...</i>

703
00:47:47,834 --> 00:47:49,336
<i>so many big terms...</i>

704
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,471
<i>what do they actually mean?</i>

705
00:47:51,867 --> 00:47:57,476
<i>A proper map can be drawn after defining
commonly accepted medical terms...</i>

706
00:47:57,534 --> 00:48:01,448
<i>if your prob/em or illness
falls in those definitions...</i>

707
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,310
<i>your prognosis will
tell you your diagnosis</i>

708
00:48:04,433 --> 00:48:08,711
<i>it will become clear whether you need
intensive therapy or counselling...</i>

709
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,671
<i>whether you need an
analyst or psychiatrist...</i>

710
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,108
<i>it's quite simple actually</i>

711
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,406
It's very simple

712
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,276
What are they talking
hovv to understand?

713
00:48:17,334 --> 00:48:21,248
<i>Dr. Pereira, how does one decide which
type of doctor they should be going to?</i>

714
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,836
<i>A psychiatrist or</i> a <i>psychologist?</i>

715
00:48:23,434 --> 00:48:25,675
<i>Each model has it's own
strengths and weaknesses.</i> ..

716
00:48:25,734 --> 00:48:29,409
<i>Ah individual may find one approach
more appropriate than another...</i>

717
00:48:29,767 --> 00:48:31,838
<i>depending on his
persona! preferences...</i>

718
00:48:32,134 --> 00:48:34,842
<i>and the depth and severity
of the problem presented</i>

719
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,280
If I hear another minute of this...

720
00:48:38,567 --> 00:48:39,443
I'll go nuts

721
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,070
<i>This question is for Dr. Khan</i>

722
00:48:41,267 --> 00:48:45,579
<i>Dr. Khan, how do you know
if someone is crazy or normal?</i>

723
00:48:46,134 --> 00:48:46,373
What?

724
00:48:46,434 --> 00:48:47,708
Take me for example...

725
00:48:47,834 --> 00:48:51,338
<i>many of you might
think that Pm crazy...</i>

726
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:56,408
<i>I've come for this formal
seminar in these torn jeans...</i>

727
00:48:56,534 --> 00:48:58,605
so, am <i>I</i> crazy?

728
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:04,443
<i>Or maybe all I need is</i> a <i>good stylist</i>

729
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,312
Crazy! Very scary word

730
00:49:08,467 --> 00:49:10,640
Because here we still believe that...

731
00:49:11,434 --> 00:49:14,438
a problem of the mind
is something to be ashamed of

732
00:49:15,234 --> 00:49:17,510
If you have a problem with your body,
that's normal...

733
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,079
you can tell everyone...

734
00:49:19,534 --> 00:49:22,208
'hey I'm in hospital...

735
00:49:22,367 --> 00:49:24,347
with a kidney failure...

736
00:49:24,634 --> 00:49:26,739
lung infection, jaundice'

737
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,673
But if it's a problem of the mind...

738
00:49:29,734 --> 00:49:33,307
then the whole family goes silent...

739
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,071
hush hush hush...

740
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:44,705
as if the mind is not
even a part of the body

741
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,579
Don't laugh just yet...

742
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,037
the joke begins now

743
00:49:49,434 --> 00:49:53,541
Here in Goa,
my parents used to tell everyone...

744
00:49:53,767 --> 00:49:57,544
that I'm a gynaecologist,
not a psychologist

745
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:01,045
Which means the doctor's
own family is ashamed...

746
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,679
to admit that their son is a therapist,
dealing with problems of the mind

747
00:50:05,067 --> 00:50:06,512
Imagine my plight...

748
00:50:07,034 --> 00:50:14,475
many of my pregnant relatives landed
up at the clinic for a free check up...

749
00:50:15,234 --> 00:50:18,477
and you know what,
I delivered a few babies too...

750
00:50:18,534 --> 00:50:20,707
for the extra pocket money

751
00:50:21,667 --> 00:50:23,044
No, I'm just kidding

752
00:50:29,534 --> 00:50:33,141
Dr. Jehangir Khan

753
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:10,243
Thank you

754
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,177
You'll close it please?

755
00:51:32,467 --> 00:51:35,175
So I'm Jehangir Khan...

756
00:51:35,334 --> 00:51:37,974
but you can call me '.Jug'

757
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:40,108
May I have a glass of water...

758
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:42,579
from that jug, Jug?

759
00:51:45,067 --> 00:51:47,980
<i>I'm sure you can
crack better yokes Kama</i>

760
00:51:49,667 --> 00:51:51,613
May I call you Kaira?

761
00:51:51,667 --> 00:51:53,669
I have only one name

762
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:02,112
So, how does this work'?

763
00:52:04,067 --> 00:52:06,547
I have no idea how that works...

764
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,273
you tell me

765
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,637
Can I lie down here?

766
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:13,537
Why, are you sleepy?

767
00:52:13,867 --> 00:52:16,143
I'm not able to sleep

768
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,208
That's the reason I am here

769
00:52:19,967 --> 00:52:21,446
Did you see a doctor?

770
00:52:21,534 --> 00:52:23,070
Isn't that what I'm doing?

771
00:52:24,167 --> 00:52:27,876
You mean the white coat,
stethescope, pill-giving doctors...

772
00:52:27,934 --> 00:52:30,312
I tried pills, they didn't work

773
00:52:30,367 --> 00:52:31,937
That's why I'm here

774
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,245
Sometimes I use this to
knock my patients off to sleep

775
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,943
You're funny

776
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,276
But, you need to work on your jokes

777
00:52:44,034 --> 00:52:45,308
So tell me

778
00:52:46,367 --> 00:52:50,975
Any major change in your life?

779
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,107
I just moved from Mumbai to Goa...

780
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,145
is that a major change?

781
00:52:56,233 --> 00:52:58,406
Yes that's a major change...and?

782
00:52:59,233 --> 00:53:03,943
And nothing,
the moving out, the settling in...

783
00:53:04,167 --> 00:53:07,546
Or the leaving, the unsettling?

784
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,212
No, that's not a problem for me...

785
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,210
I like to move,
not being in one place...

786
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,903
in fact I love to travel...

787
00:53:15,967 --> 00:53:18,140
it's just this sleeping problem

788
00:53:18,967 --> 00:53:23,074
So why did you move
from Mumbai to Goa'?

789
00:53:29,867 --> 00:53:31,210
You know...

790
00:53:33,034 --> 00:53:38,108
I came to Goa to be
with my best friend...

791
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,403
she's having issues with this guy...

792
00:53:41,467 --> 00:53:47,816
who she really likes,
really 'lil<ecl'...

793
00:53:47,867 --> 00:53:52,373
and she thought he liked her too...

794
00:53:52,434 --> 00:53:55,074
but then he suddenly
got engaged to someone else

795
00:53:55,267 --> 00:53:58,908
So your best friend, is she okay now?

796
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,311
I don't think so...

797
00:54:02,734 --> 00:54:03,940
I don't think she is okay

798
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,239
I think her main problem
is her profession

799
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:11,907
She got this dream job,
which is linked to him...

800
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:15,107
his new fiance will
also be on this project

801
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,737
So how will she handle that'?

802
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,311
I don't know

803
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:20,877
What if everything gets messed up?

804
00:54:20,933 --> 00:54:23,743
I don't know what to advise her...

805
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,007
should she just deal with it?

806
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,246
It is her dream job after all

807
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,109
Sometimes I feel I should tell her -

808
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,043
'Grit your teeth and just do it...

809
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:35,240
you won't get another
opportunity like this'

810
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,902
And sometimes I feel I should say -

811
00:54:36,967 --> 00:54:38,275
'Shut up! And say no!...

812
00:54:38,433 --> 00:54:39,878
don't you have self respect?'

813
00:54:39,933 --> 00:54:43,745
So I don't know what to tell her

814
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:49,145
So you are not able to sleep,
because you are up all night...

815
00:54:49,234 --> 00:54:54,980
wondering whether to tell
your best friend to shut up or not?

816
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,438
My grandfather used
to tell me a story...

817
00:55:01,134 --> 00:55:04,707
please narrate it to your best friend

818
00:55:05,667 --> 00:55:08,841
My grandfather was a mountain-climber

819
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:13,940
Before any expedition,
he would be thoroughly prepared

820
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,280
<i>Sad/y, poor Pyare/a/ji
was not like this</i>

821
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:21,212
<i>Who Pyareiaiji?</i>

822
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:25,007
A very old friend of my grandfathers'

823
00:55:25,367 --> 00:55:26,971
He was also a
mountain-climbing enthusiast...

824
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:31,171
whose life-long desire
was to climb the toughest peak...

825
00:55:31,434 --> 00:55:33,209
Mt. Everest!

826
00:55:34,767 --> 00:55:37,407
<i>Finally one day, Pyare/a/ji
got the chance to climb Mt. Everest...</i>

827
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:40,113
with a Chinese trekking
expedition group

828
00:55:40,334 --> 00:55:45,875
Without thought or preparation,
he said yes and left

829
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:48,038
But the group was Chinese...

830
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,305
so they could speak only
in their own language...

831
00:55:50,367 --> 00:55:52,210
no English Vinglish

832
00:55:53,167 --> 00:55:55,807
So the trek began

833
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,177
As they slowly and
steadily climbed higher...

834
00:56:00,634 --> 00:56:07,609
<i>Pyare§a§ji paced ahead of
the group with much enthusiasm...</i>

835
00:56:08,033 --> 00:56:10,707
while the Chinese people kept waving
from behind and shouting in Chinese...

836
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:14,180
<i>'Don't go ahead! hatahau hatahau/L.</i>

837
00:56:14,233 --> 00:56:18,204
<i>but Pyare/a/ji thought
they were cheering him</i> oh...

838
00:56:18,267 --> 00:56:21,908
and saying 'go ahead,

839
00:56:22,267 --> 00:56:23,712
You can speak Chinese?

840
00:56:24,067 --> 00:56:24,909
Can you?

841
00:56:24,967 --> 00:56:25,672
<i>No</i>

842
00:56:25,733 --> 00:56:26,939
Then this works

843
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,172
Don't laugh, listen

844
00:56:28,367 --> 00:56:33,612
<i>Sudden/y, Pyare/a/ji saw</i> a <i>growling
snow leopard in front of him...</i>

845
00:56:33,667 --> 00:56:37,615
<i>Pyare§a§ got scre“"
1 mean he got bloody scared</i>

846
00:56:37,667 --> 00:56:39,977
Now he started waving his hands
frantically and shouting 'Help, Help!'

847
00:56:40,033 --> 00:56:44,743
But the Chinese people
thought he is just happy

848
00:56:44,967 --> 00:56:49,712
So he kept crying for help,
and they kept waving back

849
00:56:50,767 --> 00:56:51,939
Then?

850
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,773
<i>Then the snow leopard
ate up poor Pyare/a/ji</i>

851
00:56:55,934 --> 00:56:56,275
What?

852
00:56:56,334 --> 00:56:57,108
Yes he was hungry

853
00:56:57,234 --> 00:56:59,236
You don't find many
people on Mt. Everest...

854
00:56:59,567 --> 00:57:00,773
And the group kept shouting...

855
00:57:00,867 --> 00:57:02,778
'don't go ahead'

856
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:06,144
What a strange story

857
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,204
No, it's not a strange story

858
00:57:09,667 --> 00:57:11,806
Please tell your friend...

859
00:57:11,867 --> 00:57:16,043
that sometimes we choose
the tough path only because...

860
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,110
we feel that to achieve
important things...

861
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,578
we have to take the tough path

862
00:57:22,767 --> 00:57:26,613
We feel we need to punish ourselves...

863
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,538
but why?

864
00:57:31,067 --> 00:57:32,910
Why not choose the easy way out?

865
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,809
What is so bad about it?

866
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:40,912
Especially when we are
unprepared for the tough path

867
00:57:44,233 --> 00:57:46,110
Why climb mountains
when you are not ready to?

868
00:57:46,567 --> 00:57:47,705
Excuse me

869
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,912
You will tell your
friend the story right?

870
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,976
It's important

871
00:58:05,667 --> 00:58:08,546
Okay, I think...

872
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:11,205
My sleeping problem began...

873
00:58:11,467 --> 00:58:15,142
when Raghuvendra got engaged

874
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,107
Raghuvendra?

875
00:58:17,567 --> 00:58:18,477
The guy in my story?

876
00:58:18,534 --> 00:58:21,140
Right, your friend's...

877
00:58:21,767 --> 00:58:24,543
No, mine

878
00:58:25,567 --> 00:58:28,878
At least I thought he was mine

879
00:58:34,767 --> 00:58:37,111
We used to work together

880
00:58:40,867 --> 00:58:42,039
Jack!

881
00:58:48,134 --> 00:58:49,545
What are you doing here?

882
00:58:50,167 --> 00:58:51,737
What are you doing here?

883
00:58:53,067 --> 00:58:56,776
You don't answer my calls,
you moved here without telling me

884
00:58:56,834 --> 00:58:57,938
Without telling you

885
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,704
Why would I tell you?

886
00:59:00,567 --> 00:59:01,671
Who are you?

887
00:59:02,767 --> 00:59:04,713
Actually I have one
thing to tell you...

888
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:07,102
I've made my decision

889
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,837
What decision?

890
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,708
Kaira, I have to talk to you...

891
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,802
Just shut up, one second

892
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,043
Listen to this story

893
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,912
This man wants to climb Mt. Everest...

894
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,106
but without any preparation
he leaves for Mt. Everest...

895
00:59:24,534 --> 00:59:25,911
with Chinese companions...

896
00:59:26,067 --> 00:59:27,808
and as he's about to fall...

897
00:59:27,867 --> 00:59:30,575
the Chinese people don't understand...

898
00:59:30,634 --> 00:59:31,806
obviously, because they are Chinese...

899
00:59:31,867 --> 00:59:33,403
and they keep waving their flag...

900
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,478
and the man is stuck...

901
00:59:34,533 --> 00:59:36,137
and then a tiger eats him up!

902
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,772
Got it?

903
00:59:45,467 --> 00:59:47,947
The difficult option
is not the only option

904
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,880
We can choose the easy option
also because the easy option is easy

905
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,107
You know, forget it

906
00:59:58,167 --> 00:59:59,942
It's too much for your small mind

907
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,809
It's a very deep thought

908
01:00:02,667 --> 01:00:05,671
Are you talking about
working on the film?

909
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,707
I was talking about
NOT working on the film!

910
01:00:08,834 --> 01:00:10,177
That's my decision

911
01:00:10,534 --> 01:00:12,810
Okay, okay good

912
01:00:12,933 --> 01:00:14,139
Good?

913
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,571
Yes I think that's the best...

914
01:00:16,634 --> 01:00:17,908
You think?

915
01:00:18,634 --> 01:00:19,704
Did you hear that?

916
01:00:19,767 --> 01:00:20,905
You think?

917
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:26,779
I have already taken the
decision to not work on your film...

918
01:00:26,834 --> 01:00:28,905
What do you mean by 'you think'?

919
01:00:31,067 --> 01:00:34,844
I guess someone really
does need therapy...

920
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:36,970
You told him?

921
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:37,875
No Koko

922
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:38,776
Him?

923
01:00:38,834 --> 01:00:40,939
Yes, she told me, so?

924
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,041
And anyway why do you need therapy?

925
01:00:44,167 --> 01:00:47,705
What's the big tragedy in your life?

926
01:00:48,034 --> 01:00:50,640
You didn't want to get serious,
didn't want to commit

927
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:53,476
So I don't understand,
what is the problem?

928
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,908
You don't understand?
- No!

929
01:00:54,967 --> 01:00:56,037
Then get out

930
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,879
Oh God Kaira...

931
01:00:59,867 --> 01:01:01,904
You really need to grow up

932
01:01:05,567 --> 01:01:11,813
Good thing you've decided
not to work on my film...

933
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,677
I'm looking for mature
people to work with

934
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:17,870
What did I just say?

935
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,810
Get out right? Get out!

936
01:01:25,867 --> 01:01:27,676
Bye, see you Jackie

937
01:01:27,734 --> 01:01:30,010
I'm not mature enough to
handle your big fat project...

938
01:01:30,067 --> 01:01:32,479
but mature enough to sleep with you?

939
01:01:32,534 --> 01:01:34,571
Amazing! What a revelation

940
01:01:34,633 --> 01:01:35,907
Kaira I came here to...

941
01:01:36,367 --> 01:01:38,608
I don't want to do this, get out

942
01:01:38,667 --> 01:01:40,442
What are you doing Kaira?

943
01:01:40,734 --> 01:01:41,769
Just get out!

944
01:01:50,867 --> 01:01:53,040
Koko, are you sure about this?

945
01:01:54,567 --> 01:01:56,376
I know with all these
personal issues...

946
01:01:56,434 --> 01:01:58,812
working with Raghu will be tough...

947
01:01:59,467 --> 01:02:01,777
but this was your big break

948
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,606
Okay Jack

949
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:10,313
Sometimes we choose
a tough path just because...

950
01:02:10,367 --> 01:02:12,973
we believe that to
achieve important things...

951
01:02:13,334 --> 01:02:16,338
we have to choose the tough option

952
01:02:16,767 --> 01:02:21,944
But sometimes you need
to choose the easier option...

953
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:28,040
because at that time that
is the best option for you

954
01:02:29,434 --> 01:02:30,412
Right?

955
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:35,874
Especially when you are
not ready to face that tough path

956
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:40,938
Damn! Wish I had said
it right when he was here

957
01:02:49,634 --> 01:02:51,409
You want some tea?

958
01:03:03,667 --> 01:03:06,648
Tonight I'm going to sleep so well,
so <i>well...</i>

959
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,440
Very well!

960
01:04:36,534 --> 01:04:39,481
I was at this construction site...

961
01:04:39,534 --> 01:04:41,912
with all these construction workers...

962
01:04:42,167 --> 01:04:45,171
all short and strange people

963
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:48,639
Suddenly, I lose my balance...

964
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:51,806
and I go falling down...

965
01:04:51,867 --> 01:04:54,370
this big fall...

966
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,840
and land in muck

967
01:04:57,267 --> 01:05:00,077
I think it was a gutter

968
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:07,113
All these workers are just staring,
but no one is helping...

969
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,375
I look up...

970
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,576
and I see my camera dangling...

971
01:05:13,334 --> 01:05:16,577
and then suddenly out of nowhere...

972
01:05:16,734 --> 01:05:19,772
this group of newly married women...

973
01:05:19,834 --> 01:05:25,409
<i>in saris, pal/us & bind/s
all land up there...</i>

974
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:31,273
and they start pointing
at me, laughing at me

975
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,804
Bam! I woke up

976
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,410
It was 4 am...

977
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:41,277
I went straight to the bathroom
and stood under the shower

978
01:05:41,467 --> 01:05:42,844
Why shower?

979
01:05:44,433 --> 01:05:45,468
I don't know

980
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:51,775
I felt dirty, I felt
like I needed to clean up

981
01:05:52,267 --> 01:05:55,680
So this Raghuvendra,
he is tall and handsome?

982
01:05:56,367 --> 01:05:58,278
That's your conclusion of my dream?

983
01:05:58,334 --> 01:06:00,007
Just asking

984
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:05,738
You know what I felt...

985
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:13,748
I felt I am ugly, trashy, cheap, dirty

986
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:14,671
That's funny

987
01:06:15,067 --> 01:06:16,239
What's funny?

988
01:06:16,667 --> 01:06:18,340
I mean...

989
01:06:19,267 --> 01:06:25,377
all this from a girl who is
the opposite of ugly, trashy or dirty

990
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:30,171
That's funny... not "ha-ha" funny

991
01:06:31,134 --> 01:06:32,477
<i>0K6'!</i>

992
01:06:34,267 --> 01:06:35,371
Oops!

993
01:06:35,767 --> 01:06:37,178
What's With this?

994
01:06:37,534 --> 01:06:43,416
It only creaks when you really like
someone, but can't do anything about it

995
01:06:49,034 --> 01:06:53,346
Yes, Raghuvendra is tall and handsome

996
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:59,314
So you like tall people,
not short and strange

997
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,947
Maybe...Sid was also tall

998
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,502
So there's a Sid too?

999
01:07:04,567 --> 01:07:06,137
Yes so?

1000
01:07:06,934 --> 01:07:10,381
So I mean you're a young
and beautiful woman...

1001
01:07:10,467 --> 01:07:11,377
you will have admirers

1002
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:12,701
What do you mean?

1003
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,308
What do you mean by admirers?

1004
01:07:14,467 --> 01:07:16,504
I mean you're a young
and beautiful woman...

1005
01:07:16,567 --> 01:07:17,477
you will have admirers

1006
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:18,512
Admirers?
- Yes

1007
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:20,069
You're trying to say
that there are lots of men!

1008
01:07:20,134 --> 01:07:21,272
That's what you're trying to say

1009
01:07:21,334 --> 01:07:23,075
No, what do you want me to say?

1010
01:07:23,267 --> 01:07:24,337
Why would I say that? No

1011
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,470
That's what you are saying

1012
01:07:25,534 --> 01:07:30,142
You actually mean that I'm a fast girl, a cheap girl...
- No come on!

1013
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,508
Fast dirty cheap...

1014
01:07:31,567 --> 01:07:34,411
...why use these words?

1015
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:36,174
Isn't that what the world thinks?

1016
01:07:37,334 --> 01:07:40,611
If a girl has more than
one relationship then that's it!

1017
01:08:06,567 --> 01:08:08,137
Kaira...

1018
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:11,073
have you ever bought a chair?

1019
01:08:11,433 --> 01:08:12,036
What?

1020
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:14,410
<i>A chair, kursi
have you ever bought one?</i>

1021
01:08:14,967 --> 01:08:16,071
Yes

1022
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:20,012
And did you just go into a
shop and buy the first chair you saw?

1023
01:08:21,233 --> 01:08:22,234
<i>No</i>

1024
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:23,608
Exactly my point

1025
01:08:23,867 --> 01:08:28,077
We look at so many different
chairs until we find the right one

1026
01:08:29,367 --> 01:08:32,348
Some chairs may be comfortable
but look like shit...

1027
01:08:32,467 --> 01:08:34,947
others look nice but
are hard on the butt...

1028
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,006
So the process starts,
chair after chair...

1029
01:08:40,067 --> 01:08:42,547
how many chairs we
check out before we find...

1030
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:45,604
that one chair!

1031
01:08:49,934 --> 01:08:51,572
It doesn't creak with me

1032
01:08:53,534 --> 01:08:58,540
If we look for so many
options just to buy a chair...

1033
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,007
then shouldn't we look at options...

1034
01:09:01,367 --> 01:09:03,347
when choosing a life partner?

1035
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,108
So...dirty cheap fast...no

1036
01:09:08,134 --> 01:09:12,241
Smart clear fine...actually superfine!

1037
01:09:13,034 --> 01:09:14,980
Wait wait wait

1038
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:19,046
So the women in my
dream who believe that...

1039
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:23,105
marriage is the only
acceptable relationship...

1040
01:09:23,234 --> 01:09:26,215
I felt dirty because of them

1041
01:09:26,267 --> 01:09:31,148
See? You figured it out yourself...
you don't need anyone's help

1042
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:35,942
But the dangling camera?
What does that mean?

1043
01:09:36,333 --> 01:09:40,110
Just like my future,
it's hanging in the air

1044
01:09:40,567 --> 01:09:43,275
Maybe you should sit on my chair...

1045
01:09:43,334 --> 01:09:46,941
and I should sit here from today

1046
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,104
It's so cool

1047
01:09:50,267 --> 01:09:55,979
I wish the whole world could
hear about your chair theory

1048
01:09:56,300 --> 01:10:01,579
Why is it important for
the whole world to hear this?

1049
01:10:02,034 --> 01:10:03,479
No I just...

1050
01:10:03,934 --> 01:10:08,405
if they understand this chair theory
they will stop judging others...

1051
01:10:08,467 --> 01:10:10,913
and what a beautiful world it will be

1052
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:12,135
No Kaira...

1053
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:15,842
when you understand yourself <i>well...</i>

1054
01:10:16,067 --> 01:10:19,207
then what others think
of you doesn't matter

1055
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:28,907
If you don't take charge
of your own life somebody else will

1056
01:10:31,067 --> 01:10:35,516
I pity those who don't shop for chairs

1057
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:42,009
Kaira, will you go
back to your chair please?

1058
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,446
Looked like you wanted
to take my chair home with you

1059
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:50,449
And speaking of home,
I have homework for you

1060
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:51,210
Homework?

1061
01:10:51,267 --> 01:10:53,440
Yes I'm very strict
with my homework assignments

1062
01:10:53,501 --> 01:10:54,275
<i>0K6'!</i>

1063
01:10:54,401 --> 01:10:56,813
I want you to chat
with your mom and dad

1064
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,077
1O minutes with each please

1065
01:10:59,134 --> 01:11:00,943
Please, what will I say to them?

1066
01:11:01,134 --> 01:11:02,340
Time's up, see you next week

1067
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,971
What! We have 2O seconds more

1068
01:11:06,267 --> 01:11:10,340
Hey you saw that?

1069
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:13,072
What happened?

1070
01:11:13,267 --> 01:11:14,405
2O seconds happened

1071
01:11:17,134 --> 01:11:19,740
I don't like this buzzer

1072
01:11:20,367 --> 01:11:21,846
Homework Kaira

1073
01:11:24,034 --> 01:11:27,481
Hey, those are really
nice looking glasses...

1074
01:11:27,967 --> 01:11:28,968
Thanks

1075
01:11:29,434 --> 01:11:32,381
You're going to see Jug?

1076
01:11:32,434 --> 01:11:35,005
Yup, I have an appointment

1077
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:36,441
Really?

1078
01:11:36,734 --> 01:11:38,042
You have problems too?

1079
01:11:38,134 --> 01:11:39,169
YUP

1080
01:11:40,067 --> 01:11:42,274
I am going to get my cycle repaired

1081
01:11:44,334 --> 01:11:46,314
Repairs cycles too?

1082
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,276
Hi dad

1083
01:11:49,334 --> 01:11:51,314
Hi darling, when will you come home?

1084
01:11:51,367 --> 01:11:52,277
I'll come

1085
01:11:52,334 --> 01:11:55,178
You will be home before
Kiddo arrives right?

1086
01:11:55,467 --> 01:11:58,038
There's enough time for that,
of course I'll be there

1087
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:00,011
Your mom is in high spirits...

1088
01:12:00,067 --> 01:12:02,013
full planning for the party

1089
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:05,276
Obviously, her prince is arriving

1090
01:12:05,334 --> 01:12:09,783
Those restaurant guys
loved your film...

1091
01:12:09,834 --> 01:12:11,871
They said it was very well shot

1092
01:12:12,067 --> 01:12:13,375
Oh the hotel video

1093
01:12:13,767 --> 01:12:15,337
<i>Close up of Prawn Ba/chao?</i>

1094
01:12:16,234 --> 01:12:18,236
Anyway I'll call later

1095
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,404
<i>0K6'!</i>

1096
01:12:19,767 --> 01:12:20,905
Bye

1097
01:12:23,434 --> 01:12:25,072
4 minutes!

1098
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,338
Yes Koko, you called?

1099
01:12:30,401 --> 01:12:32,881
Yes, why didn't you pick up
- I was cleaning Kiddds room...

1100
01:12:34,967 --> 01:12:36,412
I didn't have my phone

1101
01:12:36,667 --> 01:12:38,977
Okay but I'm busy now,
can't talk bye

1102
01:12:39,134 --> 01:12:40,238
<i>0K6'!</i>

1103
01:12:41,134 --> 01:12:42,704
Shift that!

1104
01:12:43,867 --> 01:12:46,814
'Talk to mom and dad
for 1O minutes'...is he mad!

1105
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:59,937
Beach?

1106
01:13:11,034 --> 01:13:13,344
Are we having the session out here?

1107
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,746
Why not? Problem?

1108
01:13:16,067 --> 01:13:18,911
No, but is it allowed?

1109
01:13:20,067 --> 01:13:21,876
Whose permission do I need?

1110
01:13:22,234 --> 01:13:25,147
I don't know,
but aren't there some rules?

1111
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:28,975
Like privacy,
closed door, couch and all that?

1112
01:13:29,234 --> 01:13:30,372
There are rules

1113
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:35,206
But one should know which
ones to break and which ones to not

1114
01:13:36,367 --> 01:13:39,780
Now people will know I am crazy

1115
01:13:39,834 --> 01:13:44,078
Who are these people
who keep following you?

1116
01:13:50,234 --> 01:13:56,048
Despite the mess, Goa is
the most beautiful place in India

1117
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:59,005
I wish I could agree

1118
01:13:59,134 --> 01:14:01,671
Why? You don't like Goa?

1119
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:04,602
I was born here

1120
01:14:04,767 --> 01:14:09,614
This is where my parents live,
how can I like it'?

1121
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,546
Did your homework?

1122
01:14:14,067 --> 01:14:15,239
Only half...

1123
01:14:15,834 --> 01:14:17,780
I managed to talk
to dad for 5 minutes...

1124
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:21,704
okay 4 minutes,
but that's a record in itself

1125
01:14:21,767 --> 01:14:24,145
And your mom?

1126
01:14:24,934 --> 01:14:27,210
I tried, but she was busy

1127
01:14:28,234 --> 01:14:30,145
So you've only done a quarter

1128
01:14:30,234 --> 01:14:32,942
What did you chat with your dad?

1129
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,237
About Kiddo, my brother...

1130
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,939
he's studying at
the London University...

1131
01:14:39,034 --> 01:14:43,244
he's coming home soon, so
my parents are hosting a big party...

1132
01:14:43,301 --> 01:14:44,837
for his homecoming

1133
01:14:45,267 --> 01:14:49,113
When I got here nobody
even said 'welcome'

1134
01:14:50,267 --> 01:14:51,905
So you don't like Kiddo?

1135
01:14:51,967 --> 01:14:56,541
No no I love Kiddo, I really do

1136
01:14:56,901 --> 01:15:00,007
He's the only one
who can make me smile...

1137
01:15:00,134 --> 01:15:01,875
just by being there

1138
01:15:05,967 --> 01:15:10,143
When he was little,
I would read him his favorite comic...

1139
01:15:10,567 --> 01:15:13,173
<i>you know Tinkle, have you read it?</i>

1140
01:15:13,567 --> 01:15:14,102
Yes

1141
01:15:14,167 --> 01:15:19,674
<i>Hunter Shambhu,
Kaafia the Crow & Supands'...</i>

1142
01:15:19,967 --> 01:15:22,743
<i>So Supandi! was Kiddds favourite...</i>

1143
01:15:22,934 --> 01:15:26,939
So <i>I would rep/ace Supandfs
with Kiddds name...</i>

1144
01:15:27,534 --> 01:15:28,604
and read it to him

1145
01:15:29,601 --> 01:15:32,582
He loved hearing the story in my voice

1146
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:36,204
Even today, he says it's
his best childhood memory

1147
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,910
And your best childhood memory?

1148
01:15:44,034 --> 01:15:46,810
Come on, there must be something...

1149
01:15:48,967 --> 01:15:50,969
I don't know

1150
01:15:52,801 --> 01:15:55,941
What are your favourite childhood
memories?

1151
01:16:00,467 --> 01:16:02,879
My dad used to bring
me here every Sunday...

1152
01:16:06,167 --> 01:16:07,737
<i>To play Kabaddi with the sea</i>

1153
01:16:08,567 --> 01:16:10,137
<i>Kabaddi with the sea?</i>

1154
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:21,506
<i>Kabaddi kabaddi</i>

1155
01:16:22,834 --> 01:16:23,938
Go back!

1156
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:49,437
Just two more

1157
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:50,137
<i>0K6'!</i>

1158
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:04,543
I can do this all day long

1159
01:17:05,667 --> 01:17:11,049
It's important that parents create
happy memories for their children

1160
01:17:11,667 --> 01:17:14,375
Now I am a parent myself

1161
01:17:16,367 --> 01:17:19,075
So I'm hoping...

1162
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:23,407
my son has at least
some happy memories...

1163
01:17:25,334 --> 01:17:27,837
to tell his therapist

1164
01:17:32,367 --> 01:17:35,007
He stays with his mom

1165
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:39,473
In divorce cases kids
usually end up with the mother

1166
01:17:42,667 --> 01:17:50,381
I just regret not being
able to spend enough time with him

1167
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,308
I remember Shaira...

1168
01:18:04,267 --> 01:18:05,871
my doll

1169
01:18:08,734 --> 01:18:11,510
My dad's birthday gift to me

1170
01:18:12,667 --> 01:18:17,309
When I used to live with my
grandparents, Shaira was with me

1171
01:18:18,501 --> 01:18:24,417
I never played with her,
just kept her close to me

1172
01:18:24,701 --> 01:18:31,050
At night,
I would hug her tightly and sleep

1173
01:18:43,701 --> 01:18:45,874
You were shy?

1174
01:18:46,867 --> 01:18:48,005
Yes

1175
01:18:48,767 --> 01:18:50,269
l-low did you know'?

1176
01:18:51,934 --> 01:18:55,882
Shaira-Shy... I'm a genius, really

1177
01:18:55,934 --> 01:18:58,278
When I was little I was shy...

1178
01:18:58,334 --> 01:19:01,213
dad used to call me Kaira-Shaira

1179
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:02,779
But now I'm fully Kaira

1180
01:19:02,834 --> 01:19:04,814
Kaira-Shaira, now fully Kaira

1181
01:19:04,867 --> 01:19:05,845
Yes

1182
01:19:09,334 --> 01:19:10,870
Are you sure?

1183
01:19:15,367 --> 01:19:16,607
Come on

1184
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:22,773
Listen tell me...

1185
01:19:22,834 --> 01:19:25,872
why did you want me to talk
to Mom and Dad for 1O minutes?

1186
01:19:25,934 --> 01:19:29,575
Is there some Chinese
mountain story behind this?

1187
01:19:30,201 --> 01:19:32,511
Someday you'll have
to climb Mt. Everest right?

1188
01:20:03,267 --> 01:20:04,644
Where is Shaira?

1189
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:06,543
Who Shaira?

1190
01:20:06,701 --> 01:20:07,873
My doll!

1191
01:20:07,934 --> 01:20:09,641
The one dad gave me

1192
01:20:09,701 --> 01:20:11,977
l-low come you thought
of that doll all of a sudden'?

1193
01:20:12,234 --> 01:20:13,372
Do you know where she is or not?

1194
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:14,572
She may be in the storeroom...

1195
01:20:14,667 --> 01:20:17,375
along with your and Kiddds old things

1196
01:20:17,434 --> 01:20:19,380
What do you mean by maybe?

1197
01:20:19,434 --> 01:20:21,380
She must be there somewhere

1198
01:20:21,434 --> 01:20:24,347
l-low will I remember
after all these years'?

1199
01:20:26,867 --> 01:20:29,313
Do you remember anything
at all about those years?

1200
01:20:32,767 --> 01:20:33,905
<i>Taste this Bibik</i>

1201
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:35,540
<i>What is Bibik now?</i>

1202
01:20:35,634 --> 01:20:38,274
<i>Bebinca! Kiddo's favourite</i>

1203
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:39,642
No I'm leaving

1204
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:42,237
<i>Pm making coconut Iaddoos for you...</i>

1205
01:20:42,301 --> 01:20:43,302
your favourite...

1206
01:20:43,601 --> 01:20:44,807
see I remembered

1207
01:20:44,901 --> 01:20:46,938
You just want to make me fat!

1208
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:53,770
Coconut laddoos/

1209
01:20:54,467 --> 01:20:58,438
I feel like breaking
a coconut on someone's head

1210
01:20:59,334 --> 01:21:03,544
No, no violence, do deep breathing

1211
01:21:03,667 --> 01:21:06,671
What memories will
parents leave behind?

1212
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,473
When they can't remember
anything themselves?

1213
01:21:08,534 --> 01:21:12,380
Let's drink to Shaira, wherever she is

1214
01:21:29,734 --> 01:21:33,307
<i>In my street</i>

1215
01:21:33,367 --> 01:21:35,745
<i>The moon that appears</i>

1216
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,246
<i>That brings Eid with it</i>

1217
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:41,179
<i>is that you?</i>

1218
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:43,576
<i>My</i> mom

<i>Has shown me a dream</i>

<i>My heart is destroying

<i>Who is it?</i>

1224

<i>Ifs you</i>

01:22:01,134 --> 01:22:03,614
<i>My heart is protecting
itself for someone</i>

<i>Who is it?</i>

<i>Ifs you</i>

01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:15,706
<i>Who is that so far</i> away

Who is that so close

<i>Who is that so specie!</i>

1231
01:22:25,801 --> 01:22:27,803
<i>Ifs you</i>

1232
01:22:47,334 --> 01:22:49,837
<i>The one for whom</i>

<i>I'd break all other hearts</i>

<i>Makes all come alive</i>

<i>Who is in my poetry?</i>

<i>Who is in my diary?</i>

<i>Ifs you</i>

1251
01:24:05,001 --> 01:24:05,945
Hi!

1252
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,440
Oh hello...

1253
01:24:09,034 --> 01:24:10,445
That was a beautiful song

1254
01:24:10,534 --> 01:24:13,242
You have a beautiful voice

1255
01:24:13,667 --> 01:24:15,305
You totally rocked it

1256
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:20,276
If your audience is so rocking,
the song has to match up

1257
01:24:21,634 --> 01:24:24,137
I'm Jackie, this is Kaira

1258
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:28,644
And you are?

1259
01:24:30,034 --> 01:24:31,138
Rumi

1260
01:24:31,267 --> 01:24:32,507
Rumi?

1261
01:24:34,334 --> 01:24:35,278
Girls night out?

1262
01:24:35,334 --> 01:24:36,312
Yes

1263
01:24:36,367 --> 01:24:38,210
They are the best nights

1264
01:24:38,267 --> 01:24:40,713
Hey, great song bro...

1265
01:24:42,167 --> 01:24:44,010
...you killed it!

1266
01:24:44,067 --> 01:24:44,568
Did I?

1267
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:48,170
Killed who? We're all alive here

1268
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,503
Girls night, don't mind, cheers

1269
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,140
What a voice you have,
you should be singing in films

1270
01:24:55,200 --> 01:25:00,309
Why only films?
There are all kinds of music...

1271
01:25:00,967 --> 01:25:05,609
there is rock, pop, jazz, blues...

1272
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:09,380
do you like blues?

1273
01:25:09,967 --> 01:25:11,640
Blues?

1274
01:25:12,434 --> 01:25:14,573
You seem more red to me...

1275
01:25:17,234 --> 01:25:18,611
What?

1276
01:25:22,467 --> 01:25:24,606
<i>Vorresti fuggire con me?</i>

1277
01:25:25,001 --> 01:25:26,378
That was Greek to me...

1278
01:25:26,501 --> 01:25:27,946
It's Italian actually

1279
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,880
Does that mean that I'm
so deadly and gorgeous...

1280
01:25:32,001 --> 01:25:33,071
that you can't take your eyes off me?

1281
01:25:33,134 --> 01:25:34,579
Not at all

1282
01:25:35,967 --> 01:25:39,346
It means that I'm heading to a private
beach with some of my friends...

1283
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,004
to play some music

1284
01:25:41,967 --> 01:25:44,573
Would you like to run away with me?

1285
01:25:58,534 --> 01:25:59,979
Not bad

1286
01:26:56,901 --> 01:26:58,744
Somebody seems to be
in a musical mood today

1287
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:06,913
<i>"My heart is destroying itself
for someone, who is it? It's you"</i>

1288
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:09,106
Excuse me?

1289
01:27:11,767 --> 01:27:17,877
<i>"Last night! went
out to listen to</i> a <i>band"</i>

1290
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:24,176
<i>“Which band was it,
where did you go where did you go?”</i>

1291
01:27:24,967 --> 01:27:29,814
<i>"The name of the band I don't know
I don't know. ..but singer! know"</i>

1292
01:27:29,934 --> 01:27:34,508
So <i>tell</i> me more...
<i>tell</i> me moremtel/ me more

1293
01:27:35,867 --> 01:27:39,041
We didn't talk, only music

1294
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:40,904
What to tell?

1295
01:27:41,734 --> 01:27:43,736
So what was his name? Banjo?

1296
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:47,748
Or the fellow was called Cello?

1297
01:27:48,067 --> 01:27:49,410
Rumi
- Wow!

1298
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:52,037
<i>My new kursi, my new chair</i>

1299
01:27:53,967 --> 01:27:54,945
So, comfortable?

1300
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:55,944
What?

1301
01:27:56,067 --> 01:27:58,069
New chair, comfortable?

1302
01:27:59,034 --> 01:28:02,413
Yes but it's a musical chair...

1303
01:28:02,667 --> 01:28:04,669
twenty four hours will
have to listen to music...

1304
01:28:04,734 --> 01:28:05,735
how to listen'?

1305
01:28:06,234 --> 01:28:09,738
Why don't you tell him straight,
that you like dialogue too

1306
01:28:09,834 --> 01:28:13,179
l-low can you tell a musician
to stop the music and talk'?

1307
01:28:13,301 --> 01:28:15,941
He'll think I'm a musical idiot...

1308
01:28:16,034 --> 01:28:18,036
have you ever felt like an idiot?

1309
01:28:20,267 --> 01:28:22,338
I've sat through a
three hour Italian Opera...

1310
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,911
pretended it touched my heart...

1311
01:28:25,067 --> 01:28:28,276
when every minute was torture

1312
01:28:29,301 --> 01:28:32,009
I wanted to stand up on the chair
and scream even louder than them...

1313
01:28:32,234 --> 01:28:33,941
<i>Pm an opera idiot!</i>

1314
01:28:39,067 --> 01:28:40,774
Wow, okay

1315
01:28:41,001 --> 01:28:44,005
What would you do if you
were dating an opera singer?

1316
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:46,137
I would say, 'Darling,
I will do anything for you...

1317
01:28:46,334 --> 01:28:48,280
but don't make me hear the opera'

1318
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,041
Then end of story right?
She would dump you and run

1319
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:54,240
Or after 6 months of suffering,
I would run away

1320
01:28:54,867 --> 01:28:59,077
If one is going to suffer,
the other person should at least know

1321
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:02,113
What is the point
of suffering in silence?

1322
01:29:04,867 --> 01:29:05,902
See when...

1323
01:29:08,034 --> 01:29:10,378
I'm so sorry - It's okay

1324
01:29:10,701 --> 01:29:11,873
I will get a new one for you

1325
01:29:12,034 --> 01:29:13,707
I'll do it, don't touch it...

1326
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:17,944
I think it's safer to have
our sessions outdoor

1327
01:29:19,201 --> 01:29:21,613
Go on, Rumi

1328
01:29:46,934 --> 01:29:49,938
I like people who smell nice

1329
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:53,610
I hate smelly people

1330
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:55,077
Really? Why'?

1331
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,973
So you like smelly people?

1332
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:01,104
Everyone has a different smell...

1333
01:30:01,367 --> 01:30:05,247
that's how people get
attracted to each other

1334
01:30:07,001 --> 01:30:10,642
Eeks! Who goes around smelling
people to get attracted?

1335
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,206
Dogs

1336
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:15,778
Dogs

1337
01:30:17,001 --> 01:30:18,981
Ya dogs!

1338
01:30:19,867 --> 01:30:22,814
Ganju, we should record
our conversations...

1339
01:30:23,134 --> 01:30:25,876
they're true genius sometimes

1340
01:30:25,934 --> 01:30:26,344
Genius!

1341
01:30:26,601 --> 01:30:27,636
Yes please

1342
01:30:28,034 --> 01:30:35,179
"Genius is not one
who has all the answers...

1343
01:30:36,134 --> 01:30:42,847
genius is one who has the
patience to find every answer"

1344
01:30:45,001 --> 01:30:45,672
Deep

1345
01:30:45,801 --> 01:30:47,337
Which genius said this?

1346
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,037
Dr. Jehangir Khan

1347
01:30:50,267 --> 01:30:51,940
Khan...khh

1348
01:30:52,001 --> 01:30:54,038
So does he smell nice?

1349
01:30:54,167 --> 01:30:55,373
Who?

1350
01:30:59,734 --> 01:31:00,144
There you go

1351
01:31:01,034 --> 01:31:05,141
Wait let it breathe...cheers

1352
01:31:12,534 --> 01:31:13,911
Listen to this bit

1353
01:31:15,134 --> 01:31:16,169
I love chocolate

1354
01:31:16,301 --> 01:31:17,871
Okay this bit

1355
01:31:26,934 --> 01:31:28,140
Wait one second

1356
01:31:30,067 --> 01:31:32,775
Pink Floyd's first album,
you have to get this

1357
01:31:35,934 --> 01:31:41,976
<i>"I agree,
you're the most beautiful of all"</i>

1358
01:31:43,667 --> 01:31:46,705
<i>"I agree,
you find</i> a <i>place in every heart"</i>

1359
01:31:46,767 --> 01:31:48,144
You like strawberries?

1360
01:31:50,967 --> 01:31:58,647
<i>“Yes you are a dream
your every move is a charm...”</i>

1361
01:31:58,767 --> 01:32:04,115
"but, you're not one
to be wooed <i>by</i> praise"

1362
01:32:16,901 --> 01:32:17,242
Try some?

1363
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,946
Can we just have the music off please!

1364
01:32:23,067 --> 01:32:27,243
I'm sorry, I just need some silence

1365
01:32:35,534 --> 01:32:36,877
Everything okay'?

1366
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:40,606
I wrote this song for you

1367
01:32:41,167 --> 01:32:43,238
But it's okay,
silence is good sometimes...

1368
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:45,776
there is beauty in silence too...

1369
01:32:46,101 --> 01:32:48,012
let's be silent

1370
01:33:10,434 --> 01:33:11,435
That's not silent

1371
01:33:11,967 --> 01:33:13,503
I'm sorry

1372
01:33:19,401 --> 01:33:20,880
Okay play your song

1373
01:33:20,934 --> 01:33:22,845
No forget my song...

1374
01:33:23,467 --> 01:33:24,741
let's talk about you

1375
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:26,777
I want to know everything about you

1376
01:33:27,167 --> 01:33:30,148
Come, sit

1377
01:33:31,434 --> 01:33:32,674
Tell me about you

1378
01:33:32,734 --> 01:33:35,681
What was your first film about?

1379
01:33:36,034 --> 01:33:39,675
When did you decide
to be a cameravvoman?

1380
01:33:39,734 --> 01:33:40,804
What's your journey?

1381
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:46,046
You know, I haven't even
shot a selfie in my life

1382
01:33:46,867 --> 01:33:47,971
Isn't that funny?

1383
01:33:48,434 --> 01:33:48,878
So tell me...

1384
01:33:48,934 --> 01:33:53,474
I want to know about your dreams,
your inspirations, your aspirations...

1385
01:33:53,534 --> 01:33:55,411
I want to know everything about you

1386
01:33:58,734 --> 01:33:59,735
Huh?

1387
01:34:17,401 --> 01:34:18,539
What's going on?

1388
01:34:20,901 --> 01:34:21,936
Shall I put on some music?

1389
01:34:22,401 --> 01:34:23,539
Please

1390
01:34:23,967 --> 01:34:25,947
I've heard enough for a lifetime

1391
01:34:26,667 --> 01:34:30,945
So still suffering silently?
Or did you say it?

1392
01:34:31,467 --> 01:34:32,878
I yelled it

1393
01:34:32,934 --> 01:34:34,004
So he ran away?

1394
01:34:34,067 --> 01:34:37,480
No, he was very sweet actually

1395
01:34:40,367 --> 01:34:46,374
He stopped playing the song,
which he had composed for me...

1396
01:34:46,567 --> 01:34:49,741
and began asking about me

1397
01:34:51,834 --> 01:34:54,610
I felt guilty at first but...

1398
01:35:00,834 --> 01:35:05,681
Why are romantic
relationships so irritating?

1399
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:11,407
With friends,
it's all so easy, it just flows...

1400
01:35:11,767 --> 01:35:14,907
you don't need to make such an effort

1401
01:35:15,901 --> 01:35:18,939
Who are the 5 people closest to you?

1402
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:20,470
Your top 5?

1403
01:35:21,267 --> 01:35:22,302
Why?

1404
01:35:23,834 --> 01:35:24,835
There is an important study...

1405
01:35:25,367 --> 01:35:26,903
based on the size
of the human brain...

1406
01:35:26,967 --> 01:35:31,438
that shows that everyone has about
150 people in their whole universe

1407
01:35:31,667 --> 01:35:34,978
The next cut is the 5O who
you would invite home for dinner...

1408
01:35:35,034 --> 01:35:39,505
then 15 who you turn to
in times of need for comfort...

1409
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:44,641
and the final cut is of 5
people who are your whole world...

1410
01:35:44,767 --> 01:35:47,373
your inner circle

1411
01:35:50,467 --> 01:35:52,003
Who are your 5?

1412
01:35:55,934 --> 01:36:00,440
Fatty, Kiddo, Jackie, Alka...

1413
01:36:02,767 --> 01:36:04,246
Raghuvendra, no

1414
01:36:04,434 --> 01:36:06,345
And I forgot to add...

1415
01:36:06,934 --> 01:36:10,746
these 5 people can
also change with time

1416
01:36:11,334 --> 01:36:14,804
That's true but these 4
people will always be on the list

1417
01:36:14,867 --> 01:36:18,644
Okay, so think of these 4 and tell me

1418
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:21,442
l-low do you feel when
you are with them...

1419
01:36:21,801 --> 01:36:24,975
as compared to the changing 5th?

1420
01:36:25,234 --> 01:36:30,206
L-low, how do these
4 people make you feel'?

1421
01:36:31,334 --> 01:36:36,215
Special, I feel special I feel...

1422
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:40,280
important, I feel respected...

1423
01:36:40,334 --> 01:36:43,543
I feel happy and safe

1424
01:36:43,734 --> 01:36:47,648
So you don't feel safe
with your boyfriends?

1425
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,209
No...

1426
01:36:50,634 --> 01:36:53,240
I feel safe but...

1427
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:58,841
I don't know it's not that

1428
01:36:59,834 --> 01:37:01,507
With my friends...

1429
01:37:04,701 --> 01:37:08,478
I feel free, I feel like myself

1430
01:37:09,401 --> 01:37:10,903
Why safe?

1431
01:37:12,234 --> 01:37:15,772
When you start liking a guy...

1432
01:37:20,301 --> 01:37:22,212
What is your fear Kaira?

1433
01:37:30,301 --> 01:37:31,803
It's back in one piece

1434
01:37:34,367 --> 01:37:36,404
I believe broken things
can be put back together

1435
01:37:54,867 --> 01:37:57,313
l-low is the 'Brain Doctor' going'?

1436
01:37:57,367 --> 01:37:59,574
Is he married or single?

1437
01:37:59,734 --> 01:38:00,735
Didi...

1438
01:38:00,801 --> 01:38:02,712
Hi Alka!

1439
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:04,240
Look there

1440
01:38:05,567 --> 01:38:08,275
<i>Didi...
how are you?</i>

1441
01:38:08,334 --> 01:38:09,404
Rubbish

1442
01:38:10,801 --> 01:38:13,077
Why did you go to the doctor?
Are you okay?

1443
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:15,211
I went to a 'Brain Doctor'

1444
01:38:15,334 --> 01:38:16,779
What happened to your brain?

1445
01:38:18,134 --> 01:38:23,846
Nothing, if you have an
emotional problem in your life...

1446
01:38:24,101 --> 01:38:26,741
a 'Brain Doctor' can help you solve it

1447
01:38:27,134 --> 01:38:29,114
Do such doctors exist?

1448
01:38:30,834 --> 01:38:33,178
Then everyone should go to them

1449
01:38:34,101 --> 01:38:35,603
Yes everyone should

1450
01:38:43,234 --> 01:38:48,411
<i>I agree,
you're the most beautiful of all</i>

1451
01:38:50,767 --> 01:38:56,445
<i>I agree, you find</i>
a <i>place in every heart</i>

1452
01:38:58,334 --> 01:39:04,615
<i>Yes, you're a dream,
your every move a charm</i>

1453
01:39:04,667 --> 01:39:11,448
But, you're not one
to be wooed <i>by</i> praise...

1454
01:39:16,167 --> 01:39:17,703
Don't stop!

1455
01:39:17,767 --> 01:39:20,179
Come on, play the music

1456
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:37,706
<i>Heart...be silent</i>

1457
01:39:37,767 --> 01:39:40,509
<i>Don't beat so loud</i>

1458
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:48,378
<i>Let her not see
you suffer</i>

1459
01:39:49,567 --> 01:39:56,143
<i>You will smile now at my state</i>

1460
01:39:56,200 --> 01:40:03,140
But, you're not one
to be wooed <i>by</i> praise

1461
01:40:21,067 --> 01:40:24,605
<i>Should I whisper in your ears</i>

1462
01:40:24,667 --> 01:40:28,171
<i>Or scream from mountain tops</i>

1463
01:40:31,167 --> 01:40:33,477
It was good fun

1464
01:40:33,534 --> 01:40:36,538
<i>We danced to Honey Singh
songs all night</i>

1465
01:40:36,634 --> 01:40:37,772
What's happening?

1466
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:39,635
Fatty!

1467
01:40:40,334 --> 01:40:42,746
I called you, why didn't you answer?

1468
01:40:43,001 --> 01:40:45,072
<i>Hi Koks</i>

1469
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:48,671
Why are you both grinning like that?

1470
01:40:48,734 --> 01:40:52,272
Jackie is just telling
me about her new boyfriend

1471
01:40:52,434 --> 01:40:53,435
What?

1472
01:40:54,167 --> 01:40:55,009
Hello?

1473
01:40:55,067 --> 01:40:56,307
What new boyfriend?

1474
01:40:56,367 --> 01:40:57,437
L-low about telling <i>me...</i>

1475
01:40:57,501 --> 01:40:59,503
I'm right here, am I invisible?

1476
01:40:59,567 --> 01:41:00,602
You didn't even ask

1477
01:41:00,667 --> 01:41:02,078
Why do I have to ask?

1478
01:41:02,134 --> 01:41:03,078
Okay guys relax

1479
01:41:03,134 --> 01:41:04,044
l-low can you not tell me'?

1480
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:07,980
I know why, because it's
that weird guy at the bar right'?

1481
01:41:08,034 --> 01:41:09,707
See this is what you do

1482
01:41:09,968 --> 01:41:11,003
You're always judging my men

1483
01:41:11,067 --> 01:41:12,978
I'm not judging,
you called him weird yourself

1484
01:41:13,034 --> 01:41:16,982
That was then, now I like him

1485
01:41:17,034 --> 01:41:19,981
But you didn't tell
me that you like him

1486
01:41:20,034 --> 01:41:22,173
Because you never asked,
you're not around

1487
01:41:22,234 --> 01:41:24,578
l-low am I supposed to
know if you don't tell me'?

1488
01:41:24,634 --> 01:41:28,172
You keep doing this
and blame me for everything

1489
01:41:28,234 --> 01:41:30,077
I am around!

1490
01:41:31,601 --> 01:41:33,274
Fatty where are you?

1491
01:41:35,067 --> 01:41:37,240
Great you also leave me

1492
01:41:45,034 --> 01:41:47,173
Good morning!

1493
01:41:48,067 --> 01:41:50,138
Good morning Jackie Chan

1494
01:41:52,067 --> 01:41:53,341
Anything special today?

1495
01:41:53,401 --> 01:41:54,471
Yes

1496
01:41:55,234 --> 01:41:56,304
Yo u

1497
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:58,546
You're so special

1498
01:42:02,067 --> 01:42:04,274
Okay, I'm special

1499
01:42:14,234 --> 01:42:16,441
So you fix cycles too'?

1500
01:42:16,934 --> 01:42:18,140
I try

1501
01:42:18,501 --> 01:42:22,643
And if I can't fix them,
I recycle them

1502
01:42:23,634 --> 01:42:27,275
Recycle a cycle?

1503
01:42:28,334 --> 01:42:32,248
Kaira, you have to
crack better jokes please

1504
01:42:34,234 --> 01:42:38,478
So all that cycle
art in your room and...

1505
01:42:39,334 --> 01:42:41,041
Hey, hi by the way!

1506
01:42:41,634 --> 01:42:46,379
This boy was wearing those funky
looking glasses, you made all that?

1507
01:42:46,434 --> 01:42:48,277
Finally! You noticed

1508
01:42:48,367 --> 01:42:49,641
He's an artist

1509
01:42:51,467 --> 01:42:57,179
If you can't fix people
do you recycle them too'?

1510
01:43:01,067 --> 01:43:02,205
Bye JUQ

1511
01:43:02,501 --> 01:43:04,071
Sorry about it

1512
01:43:04,967 --> 01:43:05,911
That's so mean

1513
01:43:05,967 --> 01:43:08,345
Yeah that's so mean, let's go

1514
01:43:12,001 --> 01:43:13,480
Why cycle today?

1515
01:43:14,001 --> 01:43:15,480
Just breaking the pattern

1516
01:43:15,567 --> 01:43:18,013
Yes, should break it

1517
01:43:19,167 --> 01:43:22,444
You must be going insane
listening to crazy people like me...

1518
01:43:22,534 --> 01:43:24,343
all day inside one room

1519
01:43:24,867 --> 01:43:25,402
Quite possible

1520
01:43:25,867 --> 01:43:27,039
Albert Einstein once said...

1521
01:43:27,267 --> 01:43:29,577
"An insane person is one who does
the same thing over and over again...

1522
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,980
and expects different
results each time"

1523
01:43:38,967 --> 01:43:42,540
By the way, Rumi, it's over...

1524
01:43:43,001 --> 01:43:43,979
Why?

1525
01:43:44,534 --> 01:43:46,536
Can't do it...

1526
01:43:47,334 --> 01:43:49,211
it's too much

1527
01:43:49,834 --> 01:43:51,836
He doesn't fit in my...

1528
01:43:52,167 --> 01:43:52,941
I don't know...

1529
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,809
I can't handle it it's too much

1530
01:43:54,934 --> 01:43:55,969
What's too much?

1531
01:43:56,201 --> 01:43:57,009
Too much

1532
01:43:57,167 --> 01:43:59,909
<i>Wait wait, Lance Armstrong</i>

1533
01:44:03,834 --> 01:44:05,973
Did Rumi do something wrong?

1534
01:44:06,167 --> 01:44:10,411
No we were just wrong
for each other...

1535
01:44:10,934 --> 01:44:12,174
Not this chair

1536
01:44:12,734 --> 01:44:16,876
Shiver! Only happens
when we feel cold...

1537
01:44:17,101 --> 01:44:20,412
or have a fever, or due to weather...

1538
01:44:21,101 --> 01:44:24,412
or sometimes people shiver
when they are scared...

1539
01:44:32,467 --> 01:44:34,071
I just want to be free...

1540
01:44:34,134 --> 01:44:36,410
free from all this

1541
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,071
I also want you to be free...

1542
01:44:39,401 --> 01:44:41,142
free from your fears

1543
01:44:41,267 --> 01:44:42,405
Free!

1544
01:44:43,467 --> 01:44:44,844
Oh wow

1545
01:44:47,067 --> 01:44:49,047
Help me

1546
01:44:50,434 --> 01:44:52,436
Damn, our time's up

1547
01:44:52,934 --> 01:44:53,173
What?

1548
01:44:53,234 --> 01:44:54,872
Got to go! Sorry

1549
01:44:54,934 --> 01:44:56,072
Jug!

1550
01:44:58,767 --> 01:45:00,678
Get my glasses please

1551
01:45:07,034 --> 01:45:08,809
My darling boy, all good?

1552
01:45:08,867 --> 01:45:10,005
Yes all good

1553
01:45:10,067 --> 01:45:13,310
Kiddo! Spend some time with me now,
not fair...

1554
01:45:13,367 --> 01:45:15,278
Sorry, I was getting ready...

1555
01:45:15,334 --> 01:45:17,280
you know it's my party,
I have to look nice

1556
01:45:17,434 --> 01:45:18,310
You look nice

1557
01:45:19,034 --> 01:45:21,742
So are you part of this matchmaking?

1558
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:22,244
Me?

1559
01:45:22,300 --> 01:45:23,108
Yes you

1560
01:45:23,167 --> 01:45:27,115
I have no clue but
I want to see the fun

1561
01:45:27,700 --> 01:45:30,442
Sweet boy Kiddo

1562
01:45:31,267 --> 01:45:34,908
And you,
is your best friend Jackie here?

1563
01:45:34,967 --> 01:45:38,073
Is she still single or...

1564
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:43,179
Yes, she's still very
much single and so is Kaira

1565
01:45:43,934 --> 01:45:46,210
Please stop, it's starting to hurt

1566
01:45:46,267 --> 01:45:48,110
Kaira, come

1567
01:45:52,967 --> 01:45:54,674
I want to introduce
you to a young man

1568
01:45:56,201 --> 01:45:57,271
This is my niece, Kaira

1569
01:45:57,334 --> 01:45:59,314
Hi Kaira, Suresh

1570
01:45:59,367 --> 01:46:00,744
Suresh

1571
01:46:00,901 --> 01:46:01,845
Pleasure

1572
01:46:02,134 --> 01:46:03,613
Well I'll see you'll later then

1573
01:46:03,667 --> 01:46:05,010
Alright, cheers

1574
01:46:05,667 --> 01:46:06,304
Cheers

1575
01:46:09,234 --> 01:46:12,841
So you're a photographer right?

1576
01:46:14,101 --> 01:46:15,603
Cinematographer actually

1577
01:46:15,701 --> 01:46:16,941
One and the same thing

1578
01:46:17,134 --> 01:46:18,112
No, it's not the same thing

1579
01:46:18,167 --> 01:46:18,941
It's not?
- No

1580
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:19,876
<i>0K6'!</i>

1581
01:46:20,934 --> 01:46:22,208
What do you do?

1582
01:46:22,867 --> 01:46:23,971
I'm a techie...

1583
01:46:25,934 --> 01:46:28,005
does that sound boring?

1584
01:46:28,067 --> 01:46:28,670
Fun

1585
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:31,371
It's fun, then cheers

1586
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:39,884
So, why should I be interested in you?

1587
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:43,941
That was pretty direct right?

1588
01:46:46,267 --> 01:46:52,377
I can be interesting
if I meet an interesting girl...

1589
01:46:53,334 --> 01:46:54,642
it depends

1590
01:46:55,001 --> 01:46:56,139
<i>0K6'!</i>

1591
01:46:57,767 --> 01:47:00,247
See Kiddo, your favourite food

1592
01:47:00,567 --> 01:47:01,238
Thank you

1593
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:07,174
What a sweet child Kiddo was,
never used to cry

1594
01:47:09,201 --> 01:47:12,842
Never left my side, always 'Mama Mama'

1595
01:47:13,034 --> 01:47:15,241
Well I figured 'Mama Mama'...

1596
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:19,771
was a better way to get
what I wanted than to cry

1597
01:47:20,834 --> 01:47:22,780
l-low fast these Kids grow up

1598
01:47:22,834 --> 01:47:23,244
I know

1599
01:47:23,301 --> 01:47:27,113
Look at Kiddo, he has achieved
so much at a young age

1600
01:47:27,700 --> 01:47:30,874
He has got a scholarship
for a higher degree...

1601
01:47:30,934 --> 01:47:33,915
then an internship with a big firm...

1602
01:47:33,968 --> 01:47:35,641
tell them the name
of the company, Kiddo

1603
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:38,874
Dad, just stop it now

1604
01:47:40,234 --> 01:47:42,111
You will definitely be successful

1605
01:47:42,267 --> 01:47:44,747
You are doing the correct thing

1606
01:47:47,834 --> 01:47:49,609
You're not eating anything...

1607
01:47:49,701 --> 01:47:51,305
are you dieting again?

1608
01:47:51,701 --> 01:47:53,112
I don't feel like

1609
01:47:53,234 --> 01:47:54,542
Eat something

1610
01:47:56,001 --> 01:47:57,947
Fine, give it to me

1611
01:47:58,201 --> 01:47:59,737
Here have this

1612
01:48:00,467 --> 01:48:04,574
You remember Chanda,
Kiddo was such a gentle, quiet boy...

1613
01:48:04,834 --> 01:48:07,974
but Kaira, a real firecracker...

1614
01:48:08,034 --> 01:48:10,014
she's still the same

1615
01:48:10,201 --> 01:48:11,839
Firecracker yes,
you're absolutely right...

1616
01:48:11,901 --> 01:48:16,475
anger, tantrums and sulking,
most of all with me

1617
01:48:16,734 --> 01:48:21,774
You Kids have no idea how
tough it is to be a parent...

1618
01:48:21,967 --> 01:48:25,540
and it's never ending

1619
01:48:25,734 --> 01:48:27,975
Once a parent always a parent

1620
01:48:28,034 --> 01:48:28,739
I agree

1621
01:48:28,801 --> 01:48:30,803
No holiday from this job, right Ashu?

1622
01:48:30,867 --> 01:48:32,904
<i>All parents should be awarded
a President's Award</i>

1623
01:48:33,034 --> 01:48:33,944
Huh?

1624
01:48:34,001 --> 01:48:35,105
I love the food

1625
01:48:36,634 --> 01:48:37,942
So end it then

1626
01:48:38,167 --> 01:48:39,077
Just end it

1627
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:40,505
What?

1628
01:48:40,567 --> 01:48:42,843
The job of being a parent, just end it

1629
01:48:44,067 --> 01:48:47,742
You Keep going on and on about
how 'tough' it is, so just end it

1630
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:51,041
Who has forced you
to continue being parents?

1631
01:48:51,234 --> 01:48:52,235
Has anyone forced you to?

1632
01:48:52,734 --> 01:48:57,479
You didn't start the job well in
the first place so why continue it...

1633
01:48:57,534 --> 01:48:58,979
just put an end to it!

1634
01:49:00,834 --> 01:49:05,408
When kids need you the most
you happily leave them and go

1635
01:49:05,467 --> 01:49:07,174
and then complain
about their tantrums...

1636
01:49:07,434 --> 01:49:10,540
'Oh how angry she gets, makes faces'

1637
01:49:11,634 --> 01:49:14,808
It was your idea to
bring us into the world...

1638
01:49:14,867 --> 01:49:17,143
you treated us the way you wanted...

1639
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:21,041
and then you blame
us for how we behave...

1640
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:22,010
and you say it's 'tough'...

1641
01:49:22,434 --> 01:49:23,640
What do you mean by 'tough?

1642
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:24,838
Tough my foot!

1643
01:49:30,134 --> 01:49:31,704
L-low could you just abandon me'?

1644
01:49:34,734 --> 01:49:36,111
L-low could you just do that'?

1645
01:49:39,701 --> 01:49:41,146
L-low could you just do that'?

1646
01:49:41,534 --> 01:49:43,775
L-low could you both leave me and go'?

1647
01:49:44,501 --> 01:49:48,074
And the only reason you took me back
was because I failed the 2nd grade...

1648
01:49:48,134 --> 01:49:49,977
yes, I failed the 2nd grade!

1649
01:49:50,034 --> 01:49:51,707
Shame Shame!

1650
01:49:51,768 --> 01:49:54,442
Dumb Kaira failed the second grade!

1651
01:49:54,768 --> 01:49:56,941
Such an embarrassment for you...

1652
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,776
that you left everything
and came back to India?

1653
01:50:01,901 --> 01:50:06,577
And when I was finally happy
living with my grandparents,

1654
01:50:06,667 --> 01:50:08,510
you dragged me away from there too

1655
01:50:08,934 --> 01:50:10,004
You separated me even from them

1656
01:50:10,401 --> 01:50:11,175
Yes

1657
01:50:11,834 --> 01:50:14,144
<i>President's Award just for that!</i>

1658
01:50:18,834 --> 01:50:20,142
And I have a firecracking
news for you!

1659
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:21,902
Actually a bomb!

1660
01:50:22,100 --> 01:50:23,170
Are you ready?

1661
01:50:23,768 --> 01:50:25,941
I have begun therapy!

1662
01:50:27,501 --> 01:50:30,141
Yes! I am seeing a 'Brain Doctor'

1663
01:50:30,534 --> 01:50:32,775
So feel free to call me crazy, mad

1664
01:50:32,834 --> 01:50:35,075
Please say it to me
right now say it to my face

1665
01:50:35,567 --> 01:50:36,409
Say it!

1666
01:50:36,467 --> 01:50:38,174
I'm crazy! 'Kukoood

1667
01:50:38,434 --> 01:50:40,471
'Kaira's gone mad!'

1668
01:50:45,934 --> 01:50:48,471
That's what you think...

1669
01:50:51,534 --> 01:50:52,945
that people like me are crazy

1670
01:51:03,067 --> 01:51:04,705
She is a bit emotional right now...

1671
01:51:06,067 --> 01:51:07,671
she is also out of work

1672
01:51:07,733 --> 01:51:08,677
Dad, she has enough work

1673
01:51:09,967 --> 01:51:12,004
She has chosen not to work right now

1674
01:51:16,634 --> 01:51:19,740
Kiddo, go get her

1675
01:51:19,901 --> 01:51:20,902
Don't worry

1676
01:51:20,967 --> 01:51:22,446
Make her understand that...

1677
01:51:22,967 --> 01:51:25,880
once your parents moved back,
she never failed in school again...

1678
01:51:26,801 --> 01:51:30,078
so they took the right decision

1679
01:51:30,967 --> 01:51:32,947
There are all kinds of failures...

1680
01:51:34,601 --> 01:51:35,773
and I am looking at a few right now

1681
01:52:08,367 --> 01:52:09,345
You okay?

1682
01:52:11,434 --> 01:52:12,640
I don't know

1683
01:52:24,434 --> 01:52:26,414
Were you happy as a child?

1684
01:52:27,634 --> 01:52:29,409
I only remember being
happy once you came home

1685
01:52:36,034 --> 01:52:37,536
See this

1686
01:52:39,734 --> 01:52:41,543
Where did you find that?

1687
01:52:42,534 --> 01:52:44,275
I was looking for
something from my past...

1688
01:52:44,934 --> 01:52:46,436
and found something from ours instead

1689
01:52:59,934 --> 01:53:00,776
You know...

1690
01:53:01,234 --> 01:53:04,841
As children, when we are sad,
our elders tell us not to cry

1691
01:53:05,234 --> 01:53:08,272
When we are angry,
they tell us 'give us a smile'

1692
01:53:08,567 --> 01:53:10,308
You know why?

1693
01:53:10,934 --> 01:53:12,914
Just to keep the peace at home

1694
01:53:13,467 --> 01:53:16,471
When we wanted to hate
they didn't allow us...

1695
01:53:17,467 --> 01:53:18,741
so now when we want to love...

1696
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:23,545
we suddenly find our whole
emotional system is topsy-turvy...

1697
01:53:24,367 --> 01:53:25,846
it cannot function

1698
01:53:27,234 --> 01:53:28,838
Sadness, anger, hate...

1699
01:53:29,467 --> 01:53:31,413
we were not allowed
to express anything...

1700
01:53:32,667 --> 01:53:34,203
so now, how do we express love'?

1701
01:53:40,867 --> 01:53:45,213
It's okay to be angry sometimes,
even with parents...

1702
01:53:45,901 --> 01:53:46,902
It's good, it's healthy...

1703
01:53:47,634 --> 01:53:49,944
it's okay Kaira...

1704
01:54:04,234 --> 01:54:08,649
They left me at my grandparents' house

1705
01:54:12,734 --> 01:54:15,476
Mom told me this was like a vacation,
that I would join them soon

1706
01:54:18,801 --> 01:54:23,511
Dad's export business
in Goa had failed...

1707
01:54:24,534 --> 01:54:30,348
so he went to Africa, Middle East
looking for business opportunities...

1708
01:54:30,534 --> 01:54:31,706
mom went with him

1709
01:54:34,867 --> 01:54:39,282
In the beginning I was happy
staying with my grandparents...

1710
01:54:39,834 --> 01:54:41,780
in their big old house in Vasco

1711
01:55:00,201 --> 01:55:03,114
I would write a letter
to mom and dad every week...

1712
01:55:04,667 --> 01:55:06,203
sometimes even twice a week

1713
01:55:08,634 --> 01:55:15,813
At that age, 'writing'
meant drawing some pictures...

1714
01:55:16,301 --> 01:55:18,508
trying to write some big words...

1715
01:55:21,168 --> 01:55:24,672
but every letter ended
with the same question...

1716
01:55:27,501 --> 01:55:29,071
'When will you come back?'

1717
01:55:33,467 --> 01:55:34,411
I was 5 years old...

1718
01:55:36,334 --> 01:55:40,840
every week I would drop my letters
in the mailbox with my grandad...

1719
01:55:41,267 --> 01:55:44,544
then I would wait for a letter

1720
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:47,480
wait for an answer to my question...

1721
01:55:53,334 --> 01:55:54,506
but it never came

1722
01:55:57,567 --> 01:56:02,539
When they called once a month,
they had some e><cuse each time...

1723
01:56:04,534 --> 01:56:09,711
something about 'an address change, no
post office close by, feeling unwell' etc etc

1724
01:56:12,601 --> 01:56:14,308
but I still kept writing

1725
01:56:17,068 --> 01:56:19,139
And my grandad would keep
walking me to the mailbox...

1726
01:56:19,767 --> 01:56:24,045
he always said that I will
get my answer some day soon

1727
01:56:27,667 --> 01:56:31,171
Then, a year later
mom visited me in Goa...

1728
01:56:33,101 --> 01:56:36,548
with my new baby brother, Kiddo

1729
01:56:40,734 --> 01:56:41,542
I was jealous

1730
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:48,014
Because he got to be with
mom all the time, and not me

1731
01:56:50,667 --> 01:56:56,276
then mom said that I would be away
from them for 'just a little longer'

1732
01:56:58,234 --> 01:56:59,645
so I was still fine with it...

1733
01:57:02,134 --> 01:57:05,581
I remember asking my
mom if she got my last letter

1734
01:57:07,134 --> 01:57:11,674
she said that it was so beautiful that
she put it up on the refridgerator...

1735
01:57:11,934 --> 01:57:13,277
so that she could see it every day

1736
01:57:13,634 --> 01:57:15,238
I was so happy...

1737
01:57:17,001 --> 01:57:21,279
I ran to my room so I could
write another letter for her...

1738
01:57:21,967 --> 01:57:25,210
so I could see her get
happy in front of my own eyes

1739
01:57:25,467 --> 01:57:28,448
A scene I had imagined
in my head many times

1740
01:57:29,534 --> 01:57:33,380
So I took out my colours and paints...

1741
01:57:34,134 --> 01:57:39,311
drew a picture and
ran to show it to her

1742
01:57:40,300 --> 01:57:44,646
As I was about to enter the room I
heard my grandad shouting at my mom...

1743
01:57:45,334 --> 01:57:49,544
he was telling her that what
she was doing was not right...

1744
01:57:49,667 --> 01:57:51,408
how could she not respond
to my question, to my letters...

1745
01:57:52,434 --> 01:57:55,313
and then, I heard my mom reply...

1746
01:57:57,067 --> 01:58:02,244
"I can't give her false hope...

1747
01:58:04,001 --> 01:58:08,279
the truth is that we can't
take her back just <i>yet...</i>

1748
01:58:09,467 --> 01:58:11,344
not until the business is set up...

1749
01:58:12,334 --> 01:58:14,541
It is too tough to
handle two children...

1750
01:58:15,967 --> 01:58:18,379
and travel constantly blah blah

1751
01:58:20,567 --> 01:58:21,978
But everything just seemed to...

1752
01:58:23,334 --> 01:58:24,074
fade away...

1753
01:58:31,401 --> 01:58:33,972
It was a strange feeling...

1754
01:58:37,167 --> 01:58:42,173
like someone had grabbed
the TV remote from me...

1755
01:58:43,401 --> 01:58:49,317
and changed the channel from something
I loved to something horrid...

1756
01:58:51,100 --> 01:58:52,875
and then threw out the remote

1757
01:58:57,434 --> 01:59:02,941
I went back to my room,
tore up the letter...

1758
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:07,410
I was 6...

1759
01:59:09,034 --> 01:59:12,208
took a decision as a 6 year old...

1760
01:59:13,934 --> 01:59:18,349
that I had nothing more to
say to them, nothing more to ask...

1761
01:59:25,334 --> 01:59:27,336
I didn't write a letter
ever again in my entire life

1762
01:59:28,334 --> 01:59:29,005
Never

1763
01:59:32,500 --> 01:59:37,347
My poor grandad kept
trying to get me to write...

1764
01:59:38,967 --> 01:59:41,277
but I knew I had nothing
to say to my parents...

1765
01:59:43,568 --> 01:59:45,548
or to anyone else...

1766
01:59:48,434 --> 01:59:49,504
I just became quiet

1767
01:59:51,534 --> 01:59:52,512
I shut down

1768
02:00:00,101 --> 02:00:02,581
Then a year later my mom said
that they were coming back for good...

1769
02:00:05,234 --> 02:00:09,478
dad's friend had a business
partnership for him in Goa itself

1770
02:00:11,534 --> 02:00:14,981
In all these years, dad couldn't
set up his business abroad

1771
02:00:15,834 --> 02:00:20,340
So imagine, all this for nothing

1772
02:00:22,801 --> 02:00:24,041
So they came back

1773
02:00:26,034 --> 02:00:30,346
But that year was the
most stressful for me...

1774
02:00:33,468 --> 02:00:35,004
I didn't want to be with them

1775
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:39,309
I wanted to stay with my grandparents

1776
02:00:41,300 --> 02:00:43,007
They were separating me from them too

1777
02:00:45,100 --> 02:00:46,408
I threw tantrums...

1778
02:00:46,467 --> 02:00:50,005
cried a lot, troubled everyone

1779
02:00:50,534 --> 02:00:52,810
To top it all,
I failed the 2nd grade...

1780
02:00:53,901 --> 02:00:58,043
and that, not my 100 letters...

1781
02:00:58,434 --> 02:01:02,780
not the fact that I was their
daughter living away from them

1782
02:01:03,167 --> 02:01:06,171
But my failure made them
take me away from my grandparents...

1783
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:08,746
and back with them finally

1784
02:01:39,501 --> 02:01:41,412
I'm sorry

1785
02:01:45,967 --> 02:01:47,469
I'm sorry

1786
02:01:51,300 --> 02:01:56,807
If you don't cry wholeheartedly,
how will you laugh wholeheartedly?

1787
02:01:57,067 --> 02:01:59,104
It's okay...

1788
02:02:06,068 --> 02:02:09,447
I'm not much for rules...

1789
02:02:09,701 --> 02:02:14,013
but because of the rules...

1790
02:02:15,868 --> 02:02:20,749
I can't pop a champagne
bottle to celebrate this moment...

1791
02:02:20,967 --> 02:02:23,948
but we can do the next best thing

1792
02:02:35,234 --> 02:02:36,941
To letters, Kaira

1793
02:02:37,001 --> 02:02:38,002
Cheers!

1794
02:02:40,834 --> 02:02:41,938
Go easy...

1795
02:02:55,634 --> 02:03:00,606
To feel safe,
first the fears have to go

1796
02:03:01,934 --> 02:03:04,676
The fear of being abandoned,
of being left alone...

1797
02:03:06,934 --> 02:03:10,177
You have carried this
fear with you all your life...

1798
02:03:11,601 --> 02:03:20,817
this burden is falling on all your
relationships, especially on your love life

1799
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:25,012
So you leave others
before they can leave you

1800
02:03:25,367 --> 02:03:29,907
You want to say bye
before they can say bye

1801
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:36,940
Because you never want
to face that pain again

1802
02:03:39,801 --> 02:03:41,212
So, Kaira

1803
02:03:43,167 --> 02:03:49,083
Why not say bye to
this fear once and for all?

1804
02:03:50,967 --> 02:03:56,280
Why not say hi to life once again?

1805
02:04:00,834 --> 02:04:06,113
I am not saying that you
should forgive your parents...

1806
02:04:06,267 --> 02:04:08,008
or even to stop being angry...

1807
02:04:08,068 --> 02:04:10,014
you do as you wish

1808
02:04:10,300 --> 02:04:11,802
But I will say this...

1809
02:04:12,034 --> 02:04:16,949
try to look at them not in
the exalted status of parents...

1810
02:04:18,900 --> 02:04:21,278
but just as two regular people...

1811
02:04:23,234 --> 02:04:28,912
who make mistakes, like everyone else

1812
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,877
As a child it is hard
to understand all this...

1813
02:04:31,934 --> 02:04:33,880
but now, as an adult...

1814
02:04:34,101 --> 02:04:36,012
you can at least try

1815
02:04:39,668 --> 02:04:46,916
Don't let the past blackmail your
present to ruin a beautiful future

1816
02:05:04,234 --> 02:05:07,215
<i>When something touches your heart</i>

1817
02:05:08,034 --> 02:05:11,743
<i>Say hi to</i> it...

1818
02:05:12,967 --> 02:05:16,710
<i>When your heart is not in it</i>

1819
02:05:16,867 --> 02:05:20,747
Say bye to it...

1820
02:05:21,634 --> 02:05:23,636
<i>Let it come, let it come</i>

1821
02:05:23,700 --> 02:05:25,805
<i>Let it come into your heart</i>

1822
02:05:25,867 --> 02:05:28,609
<i>Say hi to happiness</i>

1823
02:05:30,134 --> 02:05:32,239
<i>Let it go, let it go</i>

1824
02:05:32,534 --> 02:05:34,571
<i>Let it go from your heart</i>

1825
02:05:34,634 --> 02:05:41,711
<i>Say bye bye to unhappiness...</i>

1826
02:05:42,167 --> 02:05:45,239
<i>Love you life</i>

1827
02:05:46,667 --> 02:05:54,984
<i>Love you life</i>

1828
02:05:55,134 --> 02:06:01,141
<i>Love me life</i>

1829
02:06:19,867 --> 02:06:23,144
Koko, I'm sorry

1830
02:06:25,468 --> 02:06:26,708
I'm sorry

1831
02:06:29,867 --> 02:06:30,402
Hello?

1832
02:06:30,467 --> 02:06:32,845
Hi Ma'am, I am calling from eBay,
are you happy with our services?

1833
02:06:32,900 --> 02:06:33,503
Yes why?

1834
02:06:33,967 --> 02:06:36,880
Please do continue shopping with us

1835
02:06:36,934 --> 02:06:37,878
Thank you

1836
02:06:53,634 --> 02:07:01,348
<i>Sometimes hold my hand,
and walk with me</i>

1837
02:07:01,734 --> 02:07:08,015
Sometimes leave <i>my hand,</i>
and let me go free

1838
02:07:10,834 --> 02:07:12,609
<i>I'm</i> a <i>little moody</i>

1839
02:07:12,967 --> 02:07:14,844
<i>You're</i> a <i>little crazy</i>

1840
02:07:14,901 --> 02:07:19,077
<i>What a pair we are</i>

1841
02:07:19,334 --> 02:07:21,439
<i>Let it come, let it come</i>

1842
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:23,605
<i>Let it come into your heart</i>

1843
02:07:23,667 --> 02:07:27,843
<i>Say hi to happiness...</i>

1844
02:07:27,900 --> 02:07:30,039
<i>Let it go, let it go</i>

1845
02:07:30,101 --> 02:07:32,342
<i>Let it go from your heart</i>

1846
02:07:32,401 --> 02:07:39,341
<i>Say bye bye to unhappiness...</i>

1847
02:07:39,934 --> 02:07:49,616
<i>Love you life</i>

1848
02:07:53,067 --> 02:07:57,482
<i>Love me life</i>

1849
02:07:59,567 --> 02:08:02,810
You are different...

1850
02:08:04,468 --> 02:08:08,541
you listen to me, you really listen

1851
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:13,777
I wish I had someone
like you in my life...

1852
02:08:13,967 --> 02:08:15,674
Am I making sense?

1853
02:08:16,034 --> 02:08:19,572
Not at all,
but that will be 3000 rupees please

1854
02:09:07,834 --> 02:09:09,313
Where were you?

1855
02:09:09,667 --> 02:09:10,975
Just disappeared

1856
02:09:11,500 --> 02:09:14,640
I have to give proper
notice if I miss a session...

1857
02:09:14,701 --> 02:09:18,410
and you left me with one small note

1858
02:09:18,467 --> 02:09:20,538
'Sorry'... that's not fair

1859
02:09:20,600 --> 02:09:23,581
I know, life is unfair

1860
02:09:24,534 --> 02:09:25,638
Fine

1861
02:09:26,734 --> 02:09:27,872
Hide all your secrets

1862
02:09:34,367 --> 02:09:35,311
You know...

1863
02:09:35,367 --> 02:09:39,247
my issues with my
parents may get sorted...

1864
02:09:39,534 --> 02:09:43,243
but with men!

1865
02:09:43,500 --> 02:09:45,605
I am never going to find anyone

1866
02:09:52,701 --> 02:09:53,839
Tell me something

1867
02:09:55,834 --> 02:10:00,340
ls there such a thing
as a perfect relationship?

1868
02:10:00,567 --> 02:10:04,515
Like just one special relationship?

1869
02:10:06,901 --> 02:10:08,812
Kaira I think...

1870
02:10:09,600 --> 02:10:14,310
why just that one
special relationship?

1871
02:10:14,934 --> 02:10:17,244
I think one can have
many relationships in life...

1872
02:10:17,300 --> 02:10:19,780
different relationships
for different experiences...

1873
02:10:19,834 --> 02:10:23,839
like a musical relationship...

1874
02:10:24,301 --> 02:10:28,716
someone who shares
our interest in music...

1875
02:10:29,367 --> 02:10:32,541
or the lets-get-coffee-together
relationship...

1876
02:10:32,834 --> 02:10:37,943
perfect to have coffee with...
but not anything else...

1877
02:10:39,234 --> 02:10:41,544
Special gossip relationship...

1878
02:10:41,600 --> 02:10:44,740
with whom you can
have the perfect gossip

1879
02:10:45,301 --> 02:10:48,305
Or the special
intellectual relationship...

1880
02:10:48,467 --> 02:10:52,210
for all those perfect
bookish discussions...

1881
02:10:53,234 --> 02:10:57,341
So many different,
special relationships...

1882
02:11:02,134 --> 02:11:06,913
The romantic relationship
is just one of many

1883
02:11:08,234 --> 02:11:13,234
To expect a single relationship
to take on the burden of every need...

1884
02:11:19,467 --> 02:11:21,640
a bit unfair, right?

1885
02:11:28,567 --> 02:11:30,137
Never thought of it this way

1886
02:11:39,701 --> 02:11:41,476
I'm glad the camera is back

1887
02:11:41,534 --> 02:11:42,842
Me too

1888
02:11:50,634 --> 02:11:56,107
Jug, do you want to get
a cup of coffee or something?

1889
02:11:56,634 --> 02:12:00,309
No, our time's up

1890
02:12:03,734 --> 02:12:06,180
You won't bunk the next session right'?

1891
02:12:06,334 --> 02:12:08,314
It is the last week of our sessions...

1892
02:12:08,767 --> 02:12:10,440
how can I miss that'?

1893
02:12:41,301 --> 02:12:43,804
So, done sulking with Goa?

1894
02:12:44,400 --> 02:12:45,538
No more sulking

1895
02:12:47,467 --> 02:12:48,844
What about your work?

1896
02:12:49,134 --> 02:12:51,375
Actually I got an offer

1897
02:12:52,200 --> 02:12:52,837
What?

1898
02:12:53,667 --> 02:12:57,410
A production company is interested
in funding my short film...

1899
02:12:57,700 --> 02:13:02,672
so I am thinking,
why not stay back here and shoot it

1900
02:13:15,667 --> 02:13:19,444
Since it's the final class,
have I passed?

1901
02:13:20,300 --> 02:13:23,645
This isn't school, to pass or fail

1902
02:13:26,267 --> 02:13:29,373
I wish there were teachers
like you in school

1903
02:13:29,734 --> 02:13:31,509
I'm no teacher

1904
02:13:32,034 --> 02:13:34,378
Okay not teacher but...

1905
02:13:35,200 --> 02:13:36,508
you know what I mean

1906
02:13:37,101 --> 02:13:41,106
We are all our own teachers
in the school of life

1907
02:13:41,501 --> 02:13:43,572
Okay, that got a bit heavy

1908
02:13:45,234 --> 02:13:50,206
Life is like a jigsaw puzzle

1909
02:13:50,634 --> 02:13:55,174
People like me can help
you find the missing pieces...

1910
02:13:55,334 --> 02:13:58,247
and put them back together...

1911
02:13:59,701 --> 02:14:03,046
but, only you can complete the puzzle

1912
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:17,245
So now that this is over...

1913
02:14:21,601 --> 02:14:26,380
can we meet outside of this...

1914
02:14:27,501 --> 02:14:30,277
just as friends or something?

1915
02:14:30,534 --> 02:14:33,140
No this is not possible Kaira

1916
02:14:33,267 --> 02:14:36,305
And what if I tell you...

1917
02:14:36,968 --> 02:14:38,709
that I like you...

1918
02:14:42,968 --> 02:14:44,038
In fact...

1919
02:14:48,101 --> 02:14:50,172
Go on, I'm listening

1920
02:14:53,101 --> 02:14:55,445
In fact I really like you

1921
02:14:58,567 --> 02:15:01,104
That's it, said it

1922
02:15:05,001 --> 02:15:07,038
I really like you too

1923
02:15:08,200 --> 02:15:10,077
I really like you

1924
02:15:11,034 --> 02:15:13,207
I respect your feelings...

1925
02:15:13,867 --> 02:15:17,041
but my job here is done for now

1926
02:15:17,534 --> 02:15:23,974
As unconventional and friendly
as my methods may be...

1927
02:15:24,234 --> 02:15:28,114
I am still your therapist...

1928
02:15:29,267 --> 02:15:35,479
any other 'friendship' would be outside
the realm of my own professional ethics

1929
02:15:39,301 --> 02:15:46,150
The closeness that you may feel to me,
your 'BET...

1930
02:15:46,200 --> 02:15:48,874
is very normal

1931
02:15:51,267 --> 02:15:55,875
This happens, it's common

1932
02:15:56,034 --> 02:15:56,978
So I'm common?

1933
02:15:57,034 --> 02:16:00,982
No, you are not common

1934
02:16:01,100 --> 02:16:03,512
You are different, special...

1935
02:16:03,867 --> 02:16:05,403
you are unique

1936
02:16:07,334 --> 02:16:08,176
You know Kaira

1937
02:16:08,234 --> 02:16:15,152
People feel all sorts
of strong emotions in here...

1938
02:16:15,367 --> 02:16:18,940
anger, hate, love

1939
02:16:19,900 --> 02:16:22,506
I shouldn't have said anything

1940
02:16:22,567 --> 02:16:24,478
No, you should have

1941
02:16:24,867 --> 02:16:28,906
It's really good
you said what you said

1942
02:16:29,567 --> 02:16:34,312
You expressed your
difficult feelings...

1943
02:16:34,367 --> 02:16:38,873
in a straightforward
and mature manner...

1944
02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:42,909
rather than letting them fester...

1945
02:16:43,067 --> 02:16:46,014
inside of you...

1946
02:16:46,834 --> 02:16:48,279
and we don't want that...

1947
02:16:48,500 --> 02:16:48,978
<i>No</i>

1948
02:16:52,800 --> 02:16:56,907
This Kaira, is huge progress

1949
02:17:11,234 --> 02:17:14,477
Okay but, tell me one thing

1950
02:17:14,934 --> 02:17:16,743
l-low can this be the last session'?

1951
02:17:16,801 --> 02:17:19,145
No no...

1952
02:17:20,467 --> 02:17:22,174
No more stories?

1953
02:17:22,834 --> 02:17:26,077
So many new problems I will have...

1954
02:17:26,934 --> 02:17:32,043
Yes there will be many problems...

1955
02:17:32,734 --> 02:17:39,083
but now you know how to solve them

1956
02:17:43,067 --> 02:17:45,343
But I'll need help

1957
02:17:46,967 --> 02:17:48,776
I need you

1958
02:17:56,300 --> 02:17:57,370
Kaira...

1959
02:17:58,201 --> 02:18:00,681
when you see a pattern
emerging in life...

1960
02:18:01,067 --> 02:18:06,710
a habit,
then it's time to think about it

1961
02:18:07,101 --> 02:18:10,344
Genius is about knowing when to stop

1962
02:19:17,167 --> 02:19:18,339
Okay then

1963
02:21:20,800 --> 02:21:25,772
Baby Fatima, can't believe it

1964
02:21:28,567 --> 02:21:33,915
<i>This is your godmother, Kokomaa</i>

1965
02:21:42,134 --> 02:21:45,081
Battle after battle

1966
02:21:45,734 --> 02:21:50,615
Corporal Balthazar fought
in the Portuguese army for 14 years

1967
02:21:52,101 --> 02:21:56,516
Nobody knew that Corporal
Balthazar was not Balthazar...

1968
02:21:56,567 --> 02:21:59,571
but Dona Maria, a woman...

1969
02:21:59,933 --> 02:22:02,846
disguised as a man

1970
02:22:03,100 --> 02:22:09,073
This was the only way for a woman
to safeguard her life and dignity

1971
02:22:09,234 --> 02:22:12,807
For 14 years Dona Maria
fought two battles...

1972
02:22:12,867 --> 02:22:16,679
one on the battlefield,
and the other with herself...

1973
02:22:16,867 --> 02:22:19,780
with her fears

1974
02:22:19,834 --> 02:22:23,111
Finally, one day on the battlefield,
her true identity was revealed

1975
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:24,635
As fate would have it...

1976
02:22:24,767 --> 02:22:27,543
in front of Captain Aphonso...

1977
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:34,908
Captain Aphonso...

1978
02:22:35,067 --> 02:22:37,741
Commander of the fort and a doctor...

1979
02:22:37,900 --> 02:22:39,538
not only saved Dona Maria's life...

1980
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:40,806
and nursed her wounds...

1981
02:22:40,933 --> 02:22:43,573
but made her fears disappear...

1982
02:22:44,201 --> 02:22:48,172
and freed her from the
ghost of Corporal Balthazar

1983
02:22:50,601 --> 02:22:52,205
For the first time...

1984
02:22:52,467 --> 02:22:55,175
Dona Maria had the courage
to face her true self

1985
02:22:55,900 --> 02:23:00,440
Finally she felt free, she felt alive

1986
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:09,718
With her newfound courage,
Dona Maria soon became Commander...

1987
02:23:09,900 --> 02:23:13,541
the first woman Commander
of the Portuguese army...

1988
02:23:15,600 --> 02:23:17,978
Now, Donna Maria fought
only one battle...

1989
02:23:18,667 --> 02:23:21,978
the one on the battlefield

1990
02:24:15,434 --> 02:24:16,913
Speech! Speech!

1991
02:24:16,967 --> 02:24:19,880
No speech, just shut up!

1992
02:24:21,034 --> 02:24:23,514
It was beautiful my darling

1993
02:24:25,400 --> 02:24:27,402
So proud of you

1994
02:24:31,867 --> 02:24:33,039
Beautiful film

1995
02:24:33,500 --> 02:24:33,807
Really?

1996
02:24:33,901 --> 02:24:34,777
Very impressed

1997
02:24:36,001 --> 02:24:39,471
People who make music with
the camera don't need musicians

1998
02:24:42,533 --> 02:24:44,877
I wrote a song for you,
want to listen?

1999
02:24:45,667 --> 02:24:46,941
Just kidding

2000
02:24:48,734 --> 02:24:49,804
I'm proud of you

2001
02:24:50,567 --> 02:24:52,808
You gave Kaira her first break right?

2002
02:24:52,867 --> 02:24:53,811
Yes

2003
02:24:53,901 --> 02:24:56,040
She could not have
done this without you

2004
02:24:56,300 --> 02:25:00,840
Actually if I was with her,
she couldn't have done this

2005
02:25:01,834 --> 02:25:03,472
Cheers!

2006
02:25:04,300 --> 02:25:06,871
To the longest project
of this century!

2007
02:25:08,300 --> 02:25:09,540
Cheers to my baby

2008
02:25:14,967 --> 02:25:15,638
Hi!

2009
02:25:15,701 --> 02:25:16,679
Hi!

2010
02:25:17,933 --> 02:25:19,003
I was wondering...

2011
02:25:19,334 --> 02:25:22,338
Yes please tell me,
what were you wondering?

2012
02:25:22,534 --> 02:25:24,639
Would you be able to
live as a man for a few years?

2013
02:25:24,900 --> 02:25:25,844
Huh?

2014
02:25:27,834 --> 02:25:29,871
It's a really interesting concept,
your story

2015
02:25:31,834 --> 02:25:33,040
l-low did you come up with the idea'?

2016
02:25:35,301 --> 02:25:35,870
What's your story?

2017
02:25:37,300 --> 02:25:39,906
Do you make films too?

2018
02:25:39,967 --> 02:25:41,708
No, I make furniture...

2019
02:25:42,334 --> 02:25:44,905
tables, sofas, chairs

2020
02:25:45,667 --> 02:25:46,771
Chairs?

2021
02:25:48,367 --> 02:25:50,472
<i>Like Kursi chairs?</i>

2022
02:25:50,900 --> 02:25:52,675
<i>Chairs like Kursi</i>

2023
02:25:53,201 --> 02:25:55,203
<i>Kursi like chairs</i>

2024
02:26:32,800 --> 02:26:33,972
Dear life,

2025
02:26:34,934 --> 02:26:37,813
I know we haven't been
in touch for a while...

2026
02:26:38,867 --> 02:26:40,210
So nothing

2027
02:26:40,900 --> 02:26:42,243
Just wanted to say hi

2028
02:26:55,700 --> 02:27:00,171
<i>Kabaddi kabaddi.</i> ..
