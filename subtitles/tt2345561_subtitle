1
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:47,972
''GRANDMASTER''

2
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:25,565
Metro Crime Stopper Cell is
constituted by Kerala Police...

3
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:29,631
...to prevent crimes in metro
cities, especially, cities like Kochi.

4
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,505
lt has been 3 months since MCSC...

5
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:34,739
...started functioning
on experimental basis.

6
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,276
Anyone who suspects the
possibility of a crime can contact...

7
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:44,584
...Metro Crime Stopper Cell -
through phone, fax, letter..

8
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:49,125
MCSC is headed by Chandrasekhar who
is a police officer in the rank of an lG.

9
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:57,968
Yes.

10
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,732
lG Chandrasekhar sir...

11
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,701
He is in a meeting.

12
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:03,740
He will come within half an hour.

13
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:12,109
MCSC was constituted for stopping
crimes in metro cities, right?

14
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:15,210
What do you feel after
3 months of its operations?

15
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,515
ls your mission successful?

16
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:21,558
That... - Excuse-me,
lG will give an official briefing.

17
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:22,753
He will be here very soon.

18
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:39,944
Good morning sir.

19
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:43,281
Sir...l'm Aby Kuriakose
from 'News Today'.

20
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,514
AGDP told me that you are
doing a story on our division.

21
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,320
Glad to meet you.

22
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:55,020
Are you so sure about it?
- Yes. - Me too.

23
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,562
Sit there. l will join.
- Yes.

24
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:00,924
Sir...He..

25
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,793
He will surely be a threat in the future.

26
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:07,202
l will deal with him.

27
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,135
He will be thrashed!

28
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:11,776
What?
- Hmmm.

29
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:13,504
Rasheed...

30
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:17,406
Sir...

31
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:21,180
The maid servant you
brought.....she left.

32
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:22,377
Sir!

33
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:27,549
AGDP's wife offered her Rs.1000 more.

34
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:32,788
l'm not in a financial position
to compete with her.

35
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,724
So..
- l will try..

36
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:35,561
Her only?

37
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,431
No...l will try to get a new servant.

38
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,604
Will it be an inconvenience to you?
- No.

39
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,934
Even if it is so, no problem.

40
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:43,734
lt's urgent.
- Yes.

41
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:49,973
You should not threaten anyone..

42
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,072
No..l have stopped doing that.

43
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,711
lf it is effective, you need
not stop it completely.

44
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,083
You can do it.

45
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,320
Who else...
l can't manage all alone.

46
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,492
What do you want to know?

47
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:10,426
Start.

48
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:14,530
lt has been nearly 3 months
since MCSC started functioning.

49
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,643
What is the percentage of crime rate
you have brought down in this city?

50
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,171
Percentage?
- Yes.

51
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,507
You mean percentage?
- Yes sir.

52
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,680
lf l explain it in that way...

53
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:27,217
...calculations based on
percentage doesn't matter much.

54
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,116
Sir...you mean?

55
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,791
l mean, Journalists like you
should have a broader view.

56
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,060
Facts are always beyond mere statistics.

57
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,560
Am l right?
- Yes..you are right sir.

58
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,192
Have you had your breakfast?

59
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:40,091
What?

60
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:44,134
Have you had your breakfast?
- Yes.

61
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,600
Since you have got the visuals you
need, you can switch off the camera.

62
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:48,366
Cut it.

63
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,976
Weren't you out of
policing for some years?

64
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:59,410
You were working us the MD of some
corporations and a printing department.

65
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,949
lt is in the grapevine that the DGP
pressurized you to take up this position.

66
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,851
Why are you keeping
yourself away from policing?

67
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:13,725
Have you read Marshall McLuhan's
book, 'Medium is the message'?

68
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,863
No..answer for my question?

69
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,602
Asking questions is
part of your profession.

70
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:22,071
Answering is my discretion.
ls it not? - Yes.

71
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,341
You are very much
interested in chess, right?

72
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,572
l have heard that were a
national level player once.

73
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:29,408
lt's an interesting game.

74
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:34,916
ln this game one who foresees the
movements of his opponent will win.

75
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,390
Haven't you heard about a grandmaster?.

76
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:44,453
A grandmaster is one who can predict
the next 64 movements of his opponent.

77
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:47,933
Checkmate!

78
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,671
Haven't l told you several
times not to disturb me?

79
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,737
l'm not a mere bakery
store owner like yourfather.

80
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,038
l'm a cop.
- Oh cop!!

81
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,269
Hm...what?

82
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:03,515
Did you swear?
- l was saying that you are a cop.

83
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,208
That you are a police man.

84
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,212
Hmm..Okay..l'll call you later.

85
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,981
Not necessary..l'm also
busy - some shopping.

86
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:13,455
Okay. l'll call you back.
l have a meeting with the ADGP.

87
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:14,525
Something urgent.

88
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,688
How careless?

89
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,233
As per the statistics...

90
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,971
... there has only been a 6% reduction
in the crime rate in past 3 months.

91
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,242
You division is not that effective.
- Yes sir.

92
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,074
How is Chandrasekhar?

93
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:36,474
ls he doing his job?

94
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,109
l need feedback.
- Sir...

95
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,317
Enough..l understood.

96
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:44,279
So, he is not sincere in his job.

97
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,657
He was the best officer under me.

98
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:48,652
Fate!

99
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,092
Once the family breaks up,
everything goes out of one's hand.

100
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,897
Deepthi Chandrasekhar. His ex-wife.

101
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:59,399
One of the most expensive
criminal lawyers in this city.

102
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:04,603
To reach that position she
had to pay with her family life.

103
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:08,811
Professional clashes between a
police officer and a criminal lawyer.

104
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:12,175
They parted in the anti-climax of that.

105
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,984
With that he broke down mentally.

106
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,614
He became insincere in his work.

107
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:24,990
He has been persuaded into law and
order by me after a gap of 9 years.

108
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,258
But he still.......

109
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,397
Kishore...
- Sir.

110
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,627
l want result.

111
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,037
MCSC is my baby.

112
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,070
lt should not be a failure.

113
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,000
Okay.

114
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:38,939
4 weeks - that is a time frame.

115
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,377
lf there is no result, another person
will replace Chandrasekhar.

116
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,312
l will shift him.

117
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,016
You follow me?
- Sir.

118
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,584
You may go now.
- Sir.

119
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:56,251
l didn't expect such a surprise
when you invited me for lunch.

120
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,095
lt has been a long time
since l met your daughter.

121
00:09:58,497 --> 00:09:59,429
When was the last time?

122
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,457
On the previous school day.

123
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,892
You were with my father.
- Yes.

124
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:07,564
l find it difficult to remember her name.

125
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:09,641
Still l find it difficult to recollect.

126
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:11,172
My name?
- Yes.

127
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,811
Dakshayini - Dakshayini Chandrasekhar.

128
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,980
Why didn't you come to me
in the previous weekend?

129
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:17,811
l waited for you.

130
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:22,184
Didn't l tell you over phone
that l had a special class?

131
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:23,288
Full day!

132
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:26,557
lsn't it difficult to manage to come
overthere to meet you in between?

133
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:27,488
Yes, l know.

134
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,057
lt is not practical, right?

135
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:34,891
l only made a mention..l can
see you only twice a month.

136
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,560
l have told my motherthat...

137
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,465
...l will spend the whole
summer vacation with my father.

138
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:44,207
You should quit your law and order
responsibility and be free by then.

139
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:45,935
We have to freak out.

140
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,080
Shall l go?
- Yes.

141
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,475
Do you remember what l said?

142
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,184
Ourtheater camp starts
day aftertomorrow. - Okay.

143
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,117
You should reach there at 10.

144
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:58,784
Fees is Rs.7000.

145
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,753
Mother won't give even a single penny.

146
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,284
Her order is not to
participate in drama practice.

147
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:03,885
Done.

148
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:06,690
Okay.

149
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:07,758
Bye.
- Bye.

150
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:08,458
Bye.

151
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,259
Daughter...
- Hmmm..

152
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,041
How is your mother?

153
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:19,041
Tonight mother will repeat
this same question.

154
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,271
How is your dad?

155
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,007
Why can't you ask this question directly?

156
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:29,611
Only when we dial 10 digits
correctly, the call gets connected.

157
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,156
lf one digit goes wrong,
it will be a wrong number.

158
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,953
At least 3 digits are incorrect
between me and your mother.

159
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,192
So, no communication possible.

160
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,592
Not digits, but 3 letters create
problems between you.

161
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,197
E-G-O: Ego!

162
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:50,939
Bye.

163
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:51,800
Bye.

164
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:12,022
Yeah.

165
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,396
No baby, l can't make it.

166
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,265
Hey chill!

167
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,101
Hello...hello...

168
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,742
l'm in a cellar.

169
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,100
No network.

170
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:38,921
Help...

171
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:40,917
Please help.

172
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,226
lt's not a coke.

173
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,460
lt's highly explosive grenade.

174
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,206
Please help.

175
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:08,479
Any leads in that kidnapping case?
- No.

176
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,913
At least in this case..
lt is not proper to avoid questions.

177
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,884
Look...

178
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,317
lt has been only 15 minutes...

179
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:21,628
...since we received a
complaint from Sheeba's father.

180
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,231
lnvestigation is on.

181
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:24,334
Nothing more can be disclosed.

182
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,631
Not like that.
lt is a serious issue.

183
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:30,535
Two close friends of this Sheeba Alex...

184
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,237
...Preethy Kurian & Chithra
Pillai are already missing.

185
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,006
lt has been 4 days
since they went missing.

186
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:35,977
Now Sheeba too.

187
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,639
So, these incidents are connected.

188
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,581
We will investigate if these
are connected or not.

189
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:45,850
Media need not take up the job
of the police, Mr. Amal Kuriakose.

190
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:47,084
Madam please...

191
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,855
lt is not good. lt was same with the
previous cases she investigated.

192
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:57,597
Do you say that you saw her
being dragged into the car?

193
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:58,531
Yes.

194
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:00,729
Sir..

195
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,240
An abduction happened.
- Hmm.

196
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,972
One Sheeba, a second year
BA student of St.Mary's college.

197
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,175
She has been kidnapped
by a young man.

198
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,077
Age between 20 and 25.

199
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,517
2 hours back.
We have an eye witness.

200
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,484
So, the crime has been committed.

201
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:18,482
Yes sir.

202
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,218
Then how can we deal with this case.

203
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:23,293
You report it to the commissioner or
DCP. Let them take up the case.

204
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:27,832
Eye witness Siraj is a driver.

205
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:31,668
He was inside a vehicle parked in the
cellar where the incident happened.

206
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:35,299
He has taken some
photos using his mobile.

207
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,573
But the face is not clear.

208
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,701
He is a close friend
of Constable Sugathan.

209
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:45,079
So, when he contacted us,
we told him to come here.

210
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,009
Then...there is also another witness.

211
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,852
Sir..Bindya Mathew.

212
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,924
She is my friend.

213
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,791
Yourfriend?
- Yes.

214
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,794
l was coming out of the mall.

215
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,928
Suddenly that car crossed me....
it was a close save.

216
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,369
Then you phone him?
- Yes sir.

217
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,233
Okay. Call up the commissioner, Kishore?

218
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,736
Since she came to us directly...

219
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,508
So what?
You do what l say.

220
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:17,439
Yes sir.

221
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,278
Sir...
- Yes.

222
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,416
The father of that kidnapped
girl has been hospitalized.

223
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,114
He felt chest pain when
he heard the news.

224
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,883
Her mother is making hue and
cry in the commissioner's office.

225
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:32,862
She says that it is a
drama by that girl's father.

226
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,160
She had been with
him for the past 5 days.

227
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:40,497
Yes.

228
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,810
Yes..Kishore here.

229
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,975
Need to talk to the commissioner.
l will hold on.

230
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,939
Explain what you saw.

231
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,367
Let me hear.

232
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,076
Please help me.

233
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,804
Please. Don't hurt me.

234
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:23,071
No.

235
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,411
No.

236
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:26,518
Please...

237
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,184
No.

238
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,524
Hello...hello..

239
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:43,901
He was talking on his mobile
that time, right? - Yes sir.

240
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,233
Non stop?
- Yes.

241
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,902
Continuously?
- Yes sir.

242
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,181
Approximately how long did he talk?

243
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,348
Around 20 minutes.

244
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:09,058
The girl's mobile was out of range there.

245
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:13,960
She was also saying that
there was no network.

246
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,258
Your phone was also out of coverage.

247
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:20,802
You called Sugathan
after coming out of there.

248
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,502
Right?
- Yes sir.

249
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:26,575
But that young man was using his mobile
continuously for 20 minutes? - Yes.

250
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,508
So we should find out the
cell service providers...

251
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,811
...who have coverage in that cellar.

252
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:37,813
Once we find out the provider,
we can trace the number...

253
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:43,190
...from which a 20 minute call was made
that time and thus identify the person.

254
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,956
Nab the person who received his call.

255
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:51,060
Kishore you have 20 minutes
to do all this. - Yes sir.

256
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,337
Sir..commissioner is on phone.

257
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,066
She is calling back.

258
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,233
Chandrasekhar here.

259
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:00,275
Nothing Susan.

260
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,311
Calling you was a mistake.

261
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,712
He was like this before 10 years.

262
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,438
Sir..these are the call
lists and photographs.

263
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:34,873
Jerome Jacob. Residing at
3A, Cloud 9, Chembumukku.

264
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,609
ls it not the person?
- Yes sir.

265
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,987
He is the man.

266
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:45,454
He was talking to his mother.

267
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:46,819
She has been brought here.

268
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:52,324
From what we have
gathered, he is not normal.

269
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,259
He is a drug addict.

270
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,001
Besides a kind of mother fixation..

271
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,906
He will keep on talking to her,
once he gets excited.

272
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:04,905
Please...

273
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,107
Didn't he call you afterthat?

274
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,680
No..his cell is switched off.

275
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,585
You wait here.

276
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:22,193
His cell phone was switched
off under tower number 2618.

277
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,625
They own a property
5 kilometers away from there.

278
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,692
An unoccupied building.

279
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,031
That's it.

280
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,038
That's the place.

281
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,371
Shall we move?

282
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,231
No...no.

283
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,633
lt is risky to go for a police operation.

284
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,604
We can't predict how he will react.

285
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,582
Two friends of this girl are
also missing, right? - Yes.

286
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,479
lf l guess right, they have
also been abducted by him.

287
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,381
So it's a question of 3 life's.

288
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:51,780
We can't take any risk.

289
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,291
What we need is a semi
commando operation.

290
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,889
l'm out of touch.

291
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,993
Wine will get stronger with years.

292
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:05,700
Really?
- Yes sir.

293
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:47,543
Hi baby...

294
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:49,405
Sweet heart..

295
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,182
How you feel in now?

296
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:56,282
Don't worry..

297
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:58,386
Don't worry..

298
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,992
Take this as an atonement..

299
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:05,728
God will punish those who hurt Jerome.

300
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,127
But you will resurrect on the third day.

301
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:14,732
As an angel.

302
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:17,334
My holly angel.

303
00:22:58,677 --> 00:22:59,166
No.

304
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:06,718
No. Relax.

305
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:07,714
Relax.

306
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,211
No..no..no.

307
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:19,489
Relax.

308
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:21,929
Relax.

309
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:26,787
Please...please...

310
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,492
Okay. lt's all right.
You are safe.

311
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,230
l'm from the police. Okay?
- Sir..please...

312
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:34,394
You relax.

313
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,470
My friends was there.
- Yes.

314
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,542
Please...please..
- Okay.

315
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:41,307
Come..come.

316
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:51,354
lG Chandrasekhar
overpowered the youth...

317
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:57,258
...who abducted three
students of St. Mary's college.

318
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:59,262
All the three girls have been saved.

319
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:02,697
MCSC strongly interfered in
this case following a lukewarm...

320
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:05,702
...response from the part
of the commissioner.

321
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:10,467
Leading lawyer Deepthi is with us to discuss
this issue..and the head of..

322
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:16,878
...Manthra institute of mental health and
research centre, Dr. Jacob Varghese.

323
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:22,079
First, Dr. Jacob Varghese...
is Jerome your patient?

324
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:23,552
lf yes, what is his problem?

325
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:27,224
He has been my patient
for the past 12 years.

326
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:31,091
From the time when l was
working in Bangalore.

327
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:34,229
His is a strange psychiatric disorder.

328
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:39,865
Like in the case of many, the roots of his
problem lie in his family background.

329
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:41,871
He is a one parent child.

330
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:43,167
He has his mother only.

331
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,967
Unmarried mother.

332
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:48,238
You can guess the childhood and
adolescence of such a person.

333
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,015
A kind of grudge towards
everything and everyone around him.

334
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:53,375
A frustration which is aimed at nothing..

335
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:57,716
Those girls who were abducted
have once insulted him very badly.

336
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:03,253
l feel that it is unjust to brand
him plainly as a criminal.

337
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:06,455
Advocate Deepthi..You are
appearing forJerome in the court.

338
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,362
How do you view this crime?

339
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,468
l don't see this as a crime.

340
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:15,533
From what doctor has said,
Jerome's state of mind is very clear.

341
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:20,768
As per lPC 84 we can't consider the
actions of a psychotic as a crime.

342
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:25,410
Moreover the officer who overpowered
Jerome in an adventurous encounter..

343
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,379
lG Chandrasekhar's?
- Yes, the same.

344
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:34,148
Shit! That his ex-wife!
- Really? - Yes.

345
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,052
lG Chandrasekhar
joins us now on telephone..

346
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:42,963
You must have heard what
Adv. Deepthi and Dr. Jacob said..

347
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:45,068
How do you react to their views?

348
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:50,872
They talked about the state of mind of
the accused and the validity of the case..

349
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:53,406
For the police, such
things are quite irrelevant.

350
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:55,010
There was a crime.

351
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:58,545
A criminal abducted three girls
and kept them in his custody.

352
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,479
He was overpowered
and the girls were saved.

353
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:05,189
A father who suffered heart attack
after hearing this news...

354
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:08,348
...he has come back to life when
he got his daughter back.

355
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:09,493
That is important.

356
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:12,124
Whether the accused is mentally ill?

357
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,363
Whether he should be punished
or not...let the court decide.

358
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:17,125
A fact remains...

359
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:22,530
Now a day's many criminals use mental
illness as a mask to evade punishment.

360
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:27,235
Those lawyers and doctors
who support this should think...

361
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:31,873
...whether it matches with
their professional ethics.

362
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,681
l don't have anything more to say.

363
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:39,584
You couldn't do anything..Susan.

364
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,321
l tried to protect him the moment...

365
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,452
...when l came to know
that it was done by Jeorome.

366
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:47,397
ln between came the intervention
of that Chandrasekhar.

367
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:48,457
Sorry.

368
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:52,027
Today the whole world came
to know that he is a lunatic.

369
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:52,761
Uncle...

370
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:54,996
We don't have any other go.

371
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,835
He will get bail tomorrow
itself on this ground.

372
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,071
Yes.

373
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:03,912
l haven't been able to recognize
my son in front of the society.

374
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:08,211
Family, congregation, status...
the future of my daughters...

375
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:09,881
My only son...

376
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,047
He is your younger brother.

377
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,785
Tell me...do you think
that Chandrasekhar...

378
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,420
...should be allowed to sleep
comfortably from now?

379
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:19,789
No...he should not.

380
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:22,656
lf l take a decision, it won't change.

381
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:24,895
l'm going.

382
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:35,842
Are you upset? After the
interaction with Chandrasekhar?

383
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:38,105
No.

384
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:42,150
Don't lie to a doctor.
Especially to a psychiatrist.

385
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:55,296
So, good night.

386
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,361
Put aside the tensions of that
chance encounter and sleep tight.

387
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:00,367
Okay?
- Hmm.

388
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:01,166
Good night.

389
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:34,833
Listen everyone.

390
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:39,406
Your drama workshop is
led by, as you all know...

391
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:45,913
...Mr. Roshan who is a famous stage
artist, director and theater activist.

392
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,811
He is nick named 'Mark'.

393
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:54,217
He is the youngest actor from Asia
who has acted as Mark Antony...

394
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:58,489
...at the famous Globe
Theater in London.

395
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:04,460
Welcome to you sir.

396
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:15,036
l'm here notjust to train you in drama.

397
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,473
But also to learn from you all.

398
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,587
We will be together
forthe next two weeks.

399
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:33,587
We try to explore the
art form namely drama.

400
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,831
An act form which is so close to life.

401
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:38,266
That is drama.

402
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:42,202
ln reality, our life itself is a drama.

403
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:46,971
And we are all actors, we
are all performers, right?

404
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:49,113
Already late.

405
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:52,982
Sorry. Cooking, household
works....ended a little late.

406
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:53,881
Don't you want money?

407
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,308
Mother is inside.

408
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,518
She has given me the full amount.

409
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,316
So you don't want money.

410
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:00,719
Yes l need. ldle pay.

411
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:02,723
l will pay only by adding your share too.

412
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,827
The balance amount...
l will give back to mother.

413
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:06,496
No need of that.

414
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:07,730
lt's needed.

415
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,531
When l learn acting,
a touch of my father is needed.

416
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,004
You are the only one who
has encouraged me.

417
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:15,400
You need my touch?
- Yes.

418
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:17,438
This much is enough forthat.

419
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:18,736
Good luck.

420
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,709
Don't hurt by giving back
that money to your mother.

421
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:22,708
You keep this.

422
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:25,206
To have pizza with friends
during the break time.

423
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:26,751
Okay?
- Thank you father.

424
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:27,513
Shall l move?

425
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:31,320
Tell Mark Roshan to contact
me if he has any doubts.

426
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:32,783
l will clear it if l'm free then.

427
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:58,173
''Are you far away from me?''

428
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:05,752
''Why did you go away
without bidding adieu?''

429
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:13,320
''Though you are just
a word away from me''

430
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:20,502
''l'm waiting for your
reply on the other end..''

431
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:27,602
''Don't go away..Oh! My love!
Come to me..Come nearto me.''

432
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:35,081
''Oh! flower! Come near me..
Come back to me.''

433
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:42,059
''Are you far away from me?''

434
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:49,660
''Why did you go away
without bidding adieu?''

435
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:19,858
''How long have l waited for your face?''

436
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:27,166
''We merged into one the
day you became my own.''

437
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:41,780
''When you were with me
just like my own shadow''

438
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:48,984
''l achieved the zenith
of happiness in life.''

439
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:55,560
''Love song sang a
line jotted down by you..''

440
00:33:56,734 --> 00:34:02,229
''Why l need the music
of yet another rain?''

441
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:10,146
''Don't go away..Oh! My love!
Come to me..Come nearto me.''

442
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:18,013
''Oh! flower! Come near me..
Come back to me.''

443
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:40,209
''l don't exist without
your face in my heart''

444
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:47,610
''l don't exist without
your voice filling my ears.''

445
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:55,054
''You went away for no reason
without telling a word.''

446
00:34:55,259 --> 00:35:02,256
''Don't you see my woes even now?''

447
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:09,228
''The silence of that sparrow
once prattled is paining inside.''

448
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:16,344
''The hearts that parted sob silently...''

449
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:24,014
''Don't go away..Oh! My love!
Come to me..Come nearto me.''

450
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:31,253
''Oh! flower! Come near me..
Come back to me.''

451
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:38,196
''Oh! flower! Come near me..
Come back to me.''

452
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:48,040
''Oh! flower! Come near me..
Come back to me.''

453
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,866
When l saw his energy and
enthusiasm two days back...

454
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:14,231
...l thought he would once
again become a terror.

455
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,602
But he is again back to square one.

456
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:18,971
Playing chess alone.
What a pity!

457
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,235
Rasheed...

458
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:22,006
Sir..

459
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:25,377
Come here.

460
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,459
What about that maid servant?

461
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:39,222
l'm searching for one.
Give me two more days.

462
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:41,394
Two days.

463
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,390
Okay...continue your work.

464
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,265
Day by day, the number
of letters is increasing.

465
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,601
They need to spend the money
for an inland or a stamp.

466
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:56,105
From the information that
someone is going to plant...

467
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,306
...a bomb in the world
trade center to a possible...

468
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:01,147
...encroachment from the neighbor have
become subject matters for these letters.

469
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,414
Majority are false pieces of information.

470
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:05,379
lt is difficult to find out the genuine one.

471
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:06,512
We should find them.

472
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:10,127
We should be able to recognize a
false move with sharp observation.

473
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:10,885
Sir.

474
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:12,827
Do you know how to play chess?

475
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:15,490
A little.

476
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,229
Don't play with a little knowledge.

477
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,135
Both in chess and life.

478
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:22,097
You will fail.

479
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,338
l'm going to pick a letter from this.

480
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,641
Okay?
- Hmm.

481
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:28,239
A genuine one.

482
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,977
A significant one.
lt's a kind of game.

483
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,080
Yes.

484
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:40,181
Here is my pick.

485
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,825
This is addressed to me...
that also in red ink.

486
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:50,326
For your eyes only - James Bond.

487
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:04,379
Dear Chandrasekhar..l have been
following you for so many years.

488
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:07,912
Frankly speaking, l'm yourfan.

489
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:11,021
No..a correction...was a fan.

490
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:16,759
You were the most brilliant police
officer in Kerala before 10 years.

491
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:18,427
The cases you cracked...

492
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:22,993
...your sharp intelligence,
some lonely battles you fought...

493
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,963
...all those are learned by heart by me.

494
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:27,597
But l need not tell you what...

495
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:31,164
...really happens to you in
the course of last 10 years.

496
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:37,707
When you faced a crisis in your personal
life, the investigator in you died.

497
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:40,607
You escaped from yourself.

498
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:43,385
Thus l lost my hero worship towards you.

499
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:48,589
But two days back you amazed
me by arresting Jerome...

500
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:53,687
...within minutes afterthe
crime was committed.

501
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:58,063
You made me realize that you are
still, always in your original self.

502
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:01,727
The most efficient
police officer in Kerala.

503
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:07,106
l can't bearto see you once
again reclining to your lazy ways.

504
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:11,475
l have found a way to keep you agile.

505
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:14,274
Stop your lonely chess games.

506
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,784
l will always be on the other end.

507
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,318
Let us start the game.

508
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:21,821
Here are the details of the place
and date of the first game.

509
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:23,924
Place -Adithyapuram.

510
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:26,527
Date n 10th of this month.

511
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:28,788
Let's start our game.

512
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,590
Don't disappoint me.

513
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:35,500
With worship....yours true friend- Z.

514
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:42,212
What do you feel?

515
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:43,504
lt's a sham.

516
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,774
Fake! We need not take it seriously.

517
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,656
There is some sort of game in this.

518
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,353
This is genuine.

519
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,492
You are right.
- Sir.

520
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,195
Picking this letter wasjust a game.

521
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:08,100
But l didn't know that another
player was there on the other end.

522
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:17,905
Anything can happen
before the next move...

523
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:26,620
This is the area.

524
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,555
Adithyapuram is 7.5 km away from here.

525
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:31,289
lt is a lonely beach.

526
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:34,095
One of the least populated
places in this district.

527
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:36,098
Crime rate is also less.

528
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:39,230
What sort of precaution can
we take in such a place?

529
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:39,994
Sir...

530
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,638
Local Sl should be contacted
immediately. - Yes sir.

531
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,732
We'll tell him to be alert on 10th.

532
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:48,839
We can deploy three of
our men for surveillance.

533
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,181
Tell them to report if they
see anything suspicious. - Yes.

534
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:53,778
February 10th...

535
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,188
February 10th is bad day for me.

536
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:48,368
Sorry. We are closed.

537
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,699
l must get a coffee.

538
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:56,537
Didn't l tell you?

539
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:00,277
l was roaming around this area
in the whole afternoon.

540
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,551
There is no good restaurant
around here.

541
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,246
Only some tea stalls were found.

542
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,053
Sit.

543
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,190
No milk.

544
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:00,705
lf you don't mind, l have
got some products for sale.

545
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:03,311
Please take a look.

546
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:04,209
Look Mr...

547
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:08,382
...when you asked for coffee l guessed
your intention was to sell your products.

548
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,185
l'm not interested.

549
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:12,315
l want to close the shop.

550
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:13,718
You please finish the coffee.

551
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:15,118
Don't say like that.

552
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:16,157
You should take a look at them.

553
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:17,592
You must see.

554
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:48,381
Good morning sir.
- Good morning.

555
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:51,494
The milkman saw the body
first in the morning.

556
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:53,085
Local Sl informed us about this.

557
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:54,790
Alice.

558
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:56,426
The scene of crime is intact, right?

559
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:58,933
l have told them not to
disturb anything till you come.

560
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,308
Afor Alice.

561
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:00,054
Was she alone here?

562
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:03,763
She had employed
3 people from Mizoram.

563
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:04,693
They are there.

564
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:09,439
lt's new contract. By 5.30,
Alice told them to leave.

565
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,834
Since it was off season, there
were not many customers here.

566
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:16,509
We got the information that this pub
won't remain opened after 6.15 pm.

567
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,471
The foreigners who come to
this beach are her customers.

568
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:22,274
She was not interested
in local customers.

569
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,781
lt's really expensive.

570
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,885
Menu is frightening.

571
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:28,249
There is no attempt for any kind
of burglary, right? - No sir.

572
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:29,484
The drawer was not closed.

573
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,489
There was Rs.8000 in cash.

574
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,627
She lived nearby.

575
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:35,957
The key of her room
is also in the drawer.

576
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:38,293
Why didn't you search that room?
- Sir.

577
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:43,196
Afor Alice.

578
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:45,903
Doesn't she have any relatives?

579
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,406
No children or relatives.
She is a widow.

580
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:06,319
What's going on here?

581
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:12,231
When did you inform me orAC after
such a serious crime was reported?

582
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:15,935
ls it enough that we attend the funeral?

583
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:16,869
Madam...that..

584
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:24,173
l need your explanation in black and
white. l want it in my office before noon.

585
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:27,283
Once the crime is committed, it's ourjob.

586
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:29,911
Nobody can interfere.
Susan... - Sir.

587
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:34,818
Though your show has not
reached it's usual standard...

588
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:36,692
...it is becoming quite boring.

589
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:39,852
There is a prelude for this crime
about which you are ignorant.

590
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:41,256
A flashback.

591
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:43,358
A letter l received.

592
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,559
That's why l'm here.

593
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:45,700
Whatever it is sir?.

594
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:46,960
Don't think bad..

595
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:49,171
You have no more roles here.

596
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:53,239
My role...that can't be
done by anyone else.

597
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:55,610
Everyone knows about it.

598
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:58,578
Had your breakfast?

599
00:46:58,715 --> 00:47:01,548
Sir...
Have you had your breakfast?

600
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:03,442
Yes sir.
- Then do one thing.

601
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,282
Be there in your office
exactly at 11 .30.

602
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:09,219
You must know...ADGP is coming.
l will also be with him.

603
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:13,060
Don't be late even by a minute.

604
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:14,730
You get me?
- Yes sir.

605
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:27,806
So, these are the
things which happened.

606
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,039
Yes sir.

607
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,270
lt's strange, isn't it Chandrasekhar?.

608
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:32,472
Yes sir.

609
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:34,216
What's your explanation?

610
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:37,780
As per the letter sent to me,
it is explained as a game.

611
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:43,149
ln the alphabet book found
nearthe dead body...

612
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,627
...A forApple is struck off and
rewritten as A for Alice.

613
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:48,727
A strange murder.

614
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,225
This is an opening move.

615
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:56,033
ln the letter he says that he writes about
the place and date of the first game.

616
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:59,733
That means, it will continue.
- Exactly sir.

617
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:01,704
The place where the
murder was committed...

618
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:03,506
...also starts with the
letter 'A' - Adithyapuram.

619
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:06,583
So, in the next letter...

620
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,207
...a place which starts with
the letter 'B' will be mentioned.

621
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:10,984
There, another victim whose
name starts with the letter 'B'.

622
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:12,889
He must be mad.

623
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:16,454
A serial killer who selects his victims
based on alphabetical order.

624
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:17,852
May be.

625
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:19,591
Why may be?

626
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,999
The total build up and
character of this crime doesn't...

627
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:27,560
...match with the criminal characteristics
with which we are familiar with.

628
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:30,030
For instance, The murders committed
by Auto Shaker in Tamil Nadu...

629
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:33,940
...and Dandu Pale Krishna in
Karnataka were very crude.

630
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:36,444
Very violent and straight forward killings.

631
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,539
But this........

632
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:39,806
All l have to say is just one thing.

633
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:42,549
We should not let him kill once more.

634
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,086
Let Susan investigate.

635
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:48,950
l will hand over the letter and our report.

636
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,219
We will hand over the next letter
as soon as we receive it.

637
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:52,927
No Chandrasekhar.

638
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,463
You can't get away from this.

639
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:57,293
The killer has personally challenged you.

640
00:48:57,634 --> 00:48:58,999
You should take up that challenge.

641
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:00,233
l'm sorry sir.

642
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:01,732
l'm not interested in this game.

643
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:06,167
Whoever has done it, he
wants me to be in this game.

644
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:06,867
Why?

645
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:07,907
Why me?

646
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:11,712
He selected 10th of
february for the first murder.

647
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:15,110
lt's a very important day
in my personal life.

648
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:18,082
l'm not interested in getting
involved in this game.

649
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:19,579
He will change his strategy
the moment when he...

650
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:20,883
...comes to know that l am
not available for this game.

651
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:22,949
This matter will be easier for us.

652
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:23,958
lt's not possible.

653
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:29,057
You will have the full responsibility
to investigate this case...

654
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:32,260
...and the crimes that might
happen associated with this.

655
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:38,506
The killer should realize that challenging
you is the biggest blunder in his life.

656
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:41,500
l want you back in the game.

657
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:44,909
lt's an order Chandrasekhar.

658
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:47,107
Yes sir.

659
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:53,048
lf there is any kind of link with
this killer to your personal life...

660
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,552
...you must resolve the issue.

661
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:58,721
Perhaps you might be able to
reclaim something that you have lost.

662
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:00,424
l don't know.

663
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:02,455
Sometimes it may be
the other way round.

664
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,196
lf more losses are going to happen?

665
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:11,567
l'm willing to take up the investigation.

666
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:13,837
Strictly because of your order.

667
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:28,250
He has signed the
letter with the letter - Z.

668
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:30,249
The last letter of the alphabet.

669
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,695
My name starts with the letter 'C'.

670
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:36,794
Third letter of the alphabet.

671
00:50:57,154 --> 00:51:01,250
The last bill is printed at
6.35 in the billing machine.

672
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,722
This coffee maker remained switched
on like this when we arrived here.

673
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:09,154
That cup was under it.

674
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:19,733
That means the killer attacked her from
behind when she was preparing coffee.

675
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:26,582
Alice, who normally closes
the shop before 6.30...

676
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:28,914
...deviated from her routine yesterday.

677
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:30,011
Why?

678
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,981
The last customer had left by 6.35.

679
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:36,116
Alice had a guest.

680
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,091
A guest who came at an odd time.

681
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,257
Alice received him.

682
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:42,028
She prepared coffee for him.

683
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:48,561
Which means Alice knew him well.

684
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:50,633
He is a regular customer.

685
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:54,739
Your guessing is quite logical...but...

686
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:57,513
This is not a guess work, but facts.

687
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:03,150
Didn't get much from the
enquiry made around here.

688
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:07,890
The only detail l got...l don't
know how far it is relevant...

689
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:08,850
Tell me.

690
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:12,222
A sales man was roaming around
this place during the day time.

691
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,187
A direct marketing agent.

692
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:17,863
His appearance evoked
suspicion among some.

693
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:22,232
lt is normal that stories circulate like
this once such a murder takes place.

694
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:25,936
So l didn't give him
that much importance.

695
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:27,837
Anyway enquire about him.
- Yes sir.

696
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:30,570
Shall l say about an intuition?

697
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:35,677
lf the killer is a regular
customer of Alice...

698
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:38,915
...there must be personal
motive behind this crime.

699
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:39,781
lsn't it?

700
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:45,792
Then, why did he challenge you?

701
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,633
Then, the alphabet book
he left nearthe body...

702
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:54,433
The cross mark made
on Alice's forehead..

703
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:59,532
The alphabet and a cross....
don't match well.

704
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,075
Like things which will never match.

705
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:02,407
Exactly.

706
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:08,212
Those are indicators to mislead us.

707
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:13,217
The killer must be a psychotic.

708
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:16,885
l think that Jerome may have
some link with this murder.

709
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,290
He must be having
personal grudge against you.

710
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,158
The court had freed him for
treatment one week back.

711
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:25,900
Where is he now?
- ln Manthra mental health centre.

712
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:43,743
Yes sir.

713
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:46,282
Should come back fast.
- Yes.

714
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:53,825
Welcome sir.

715
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:07,334
l have heard a lot about
you and your hospital.

716
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:09,243
l hope you have heard good things only.

717
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,274
A very strange murder
happened yesterday.

718
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:15,682
At Adithyapuram.

719
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:17,017
One Alice.

720
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,513
l know. l saw it in the news on TV.

721
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:22,355
After letting you know the place......

722
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:35,231
We think, a person who is mentally
normal won't commit such a murder.

723
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:39,442
That Jerome, who was arrested last
week, is under yourtreatment, right?

724
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:41,367
Did he go out anytime?

725
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:42,775
With or without your permission?

726
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,410
So you are here for that.

727
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:49,412
No...patients won't go outside
without my permission.

728
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:53,150
Even visitors are strictly controlled.

729
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:56,552
l guess, l know my job.

730
00:54:58,328 --> 00:55:00,455
Police interrogate me forthe first time.

731
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:07,662
As you said, my patient is not
that able to execute a murder...

732
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:12,638
...after challenging through a letter...
then with immaculate planning...

733
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:17,973
He has got an impulsive nature.

734
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:19,912
l don't agree.

735
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:27,920
He is a criminal who kidnapped
three girls after planning it perfectly.

736
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:31,192
Sorry, a psychotic is he.

737
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:35,359
l think that he can
commit such a murder.

738
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:39,457
Hai Deepthi...

739
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:45,504
Sit inside..l will join you.

740
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,234
No. lt's okay.

741
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:48,938
l came to drop my daughter.

742
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:53,783
Daughter? Why is she here?

743
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,979
Today's drama workshop is here.

744
00:55:58,555 --> 00:56:01,752
An interaction with some
harmless inmates here.

745
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:04,549
lt's part of their training.

746
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,261
Bye Jacob.

747
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:09,727
Don't forget the evening party at Taj.

748
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:12,528
l will pick you from your
office in the evening.

749
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:13,859
Okay.

750
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:18,567
We are also moving.

751
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:19,539
Thanks for your time.

752
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:25,772
l want the copy of
Jerome's medical records.

753
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:27,680
My men will collect it from your office.

754
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:34,480
Okay. Back to your position.

755
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:36,220
Slowly...

756
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:38,388
Lift your hands.

757
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:41,260
Now you can rotate.

758
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:48,696
One minute...l will be back in a minute.
Okay. Come on.

759
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,064
My father has come...
May l go for a moment?

760
00:56:57,781 --> 00:56:59,840
Why are you here?
- l will tell.

761
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:02,117
l hope you are not here for treatment.

762
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:04,584
Yes, l'm here for treatment.
The patient has just gone from here.

763
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:05,381
Your mother.

764
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:10,386
The doctor of this hospital, Dr.Jacob
is a close friend of my mother.

765
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:11,682
He often comes to our home.

766
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:16,899
How is your workshop going?
- l'm really enjoying it.

767
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:17,790
Good!

768
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:31,176
Father...there..

769
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,506
Meet Mr. Roshan.

770
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:34,877
Hello Roshan.
- Hi sir.

771
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:37,082
Dakshayani always talks about you.

772
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,687
You encourage her a lot, right?

773
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,147
We should encourage her
when she has such an interest.

774
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:44,021
Really?

775
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:47,960
Roshan's native place?

776
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:49,691
Originally l hail from Wayanad.

777
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:52,030
No close relatives.

778
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:56,268
l reached London at the age of 18
with scholarship - theatre training.

779
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:58,040
Have been roaming around
with drama from then onwards.

780
00:57:58,341 --> 00:57:59,308
All over the world.

781
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:01,201
With a nick name 'Mark Roshan'.

782
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:16,286
Why a training session here?

783
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,186
Dr. Jacob is a theater lover.

784
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:19,554
And a performertoo.

785
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,858
When he was working
in Nimhans hospital...

786
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:23,956
...l had conducted
a camp for the patients.

787
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:26,292
Doctor wanted to conduct
something like that here also.

788
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:29,595
l'm not wasting yourtime.
- Bye sir. - Bye.

789
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:33,833
lf Roshan has any doubts,
tell him to call me.

790
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:34,909
Bye.

791
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:50,983
Jerome...

792
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:57,024
What are you staring at?

793
00:58:58,935 --> 00:58:59,959
Did he come here?

794
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:01,194
Who?

795
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:02,736
Don't you know?

796
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,032
Jerome, let me tell you something.

797
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:14,116
Father l killed.

798
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:15,413
l did it.

799
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:17,112
May the Lord save me!

800
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:43,203
l sent for you to tell a matter.

801
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:46,408
lntelligence received
information yesterday.

802
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:49,709
There is no mystery in the
murder of Alice as you all say.

803
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:54,652
lt's a truth.

804
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:57,222
Alice had connections with a drug cartel.

805
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,996
The motive of the killing
is a fall out with them.

806
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:06,894
That gang has arranged a deal
behind the old civil station building.

807
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:11,037
Your boss might not like
my direct involvement in it.

808
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:14,073
lf l don't share what l have come
to know, it will be unethical.

809
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:25,514
Sir..
- Yes Kishore.

810
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:29,485
Susan?

811
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:58,938
Come on.

812
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:23,934
Sir...

813
01:02:39,822 --> 01:02:40,379
What happened?

814
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:41,352
l got shot sir.

815
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:43,788
Are you okay?
- Yes. l'm okay. - Come on.

816
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:50,992
A second letter has arrived.

817
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:01,644
My dear Chandrasekhar,

818
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:02,745
The first game is over.

819
01:03:02,745 --> 01:03:04,178
Score 1 - 0

820
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:14,348
You must have noticed the clues which
l had left in the scene of murder.

821
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:18,424
l really enjoyed your doubts
about my mental health.

822
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:20,388
l may be a psychotic.

823
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:23,430
But there is a method in my madness.

824
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:25,660
There is a method in my madness.

825
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:26,926
Let's start the next game.

826
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:29,003
Date - February 23rd.

827
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:30,662
Place - Binanipuram.

828
01:03:30,873 --> 01:03:32,738
The price of sin is death.

829
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:34,742
With love and respect - Z.

830
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:43,644
February 23rd.

831
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:45,283
Binanipuram.

832
01:03:46,589 --> 01:03:47,715
Just 3 more days.

833
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:50,917
l will contact the rural SP.

834
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:54,562
That whole area must
be under our surveillance.

835
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,222
A 24 hours surveillance.

836
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:00,031
l'm worried.

837
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:02,569
Really worried.

838
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:25,254
''You are like a wandering gust''

839
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:28,053
''You are a never ending rain in me..''

840
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:32,228
''You are the ultimate
meaning on this earth''

841
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:34,926
''You are burning embers in my heart..''

842
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:42,674
''My wings are tired and l'm
unsure about what is ahead..''

843
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:47,905
''Are you a lightening of love
which knows no bounds..''

844
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:51,247
''Who are you?''

845
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,683
''Who are you?''

846
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:58,222
''Who are you?''

847
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:01,421
''Who are you?''

848
01:05:02,431 --> 01:05:05,764
''Who are you?...Who are you?''

849
01:05:05,868 --> 01:05:09,167
''l'm searching...l'm searching''

850
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:12,537
''You are rushing forward..
You are rushing forward..''

851
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:13,939
''l'm singing..''

852
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:20,210
''You, as the darkness
of wandering shadow''

853
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:22,849
''Are an ever elusive tide?''

854
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:27,049
''Are you a wound in the eye?''

855
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:29,714
''Or the color of the evening sky?''

856
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:37,425
''What else remaining in
you other than dreams?''

857
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:42,763
''Are you a flame in
the soul which scatters?''

858
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:46,238
''Who are you?''

859
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:49,607
''Who are you?''

860
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:53,010
''Who are you?''

861
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:56,277
''Who are you?''

862
01:05:57,253 --> 01:06:00,552
''Who are you?...Who are you?''

863
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:03,955
''l'm searching..l'm searching''

864
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:07,460
''You are rushing forward..
You are rushing forward''

865
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:08,723
''l'm singing..''

866
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:13,966
''All my life l've been searching''

867
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:16,036
''ln my wildest dreams''

868
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:17,628
''ln my deepest fantasies''

869
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:19,772
''Close to you or far?''

870
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:21,274
''You can be the beat of my heart''

871
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:23,071
''Are you here? Are you here?''

872
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:24,510
''Tell me...who are you?''

873
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:55,802
''l want to lie awake''

874
01:06:57,313 --> 01:06:59,406
''To the smell of coffee''

875
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:04,049
''l want to walk with you by the sea''

876
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:09,424
''l want you to hold my hand''

877
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:18,824
''You and me..making new destiny..''

878
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:21,198
''Who are you?''

879
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:25,100
''Who are you?''

880
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:28,608
''Who are you?''

881
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:32,273
''Who are you?''

882
01:07:32,848 --> 01:07:35,908
''Who are you?''

883
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:39,085
''Who are you?''

884
01:07:39,455 --> 01:07:42,618
''Who are you?''

885
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:46,224
''Who are you?''

886
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:49,320
''Who are you?''

887
01:07:49,765 --> 01:07:52,757
''Who are you?''

888
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:56,035
''Who are you?''

889
01:07:56,772 --> 01:08:00,606
''Who are you?''

890
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:46,478
Hello.

891
01:08:48,023 --> 01:08:48,580
Where?

892
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:51,519
l'm coming.

893
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:38,837
B for Beena.

894
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:42,303
Beena!

895
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:57,884
He made a mistake in this game.

896
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:03,727
He has left evidence there
which shows his identity.

897
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:05,829
Let us play the game.

898
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:13,474
''You are somewhere far away''

899
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:34,595
ln the name of the Holy Trinity..Amen.

900
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:45,699
God! Are you giving the right orders?

901
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:50,011
Sons of man, are your
judgments meaningful?

902
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:53,876
No..you have evil thoughts in your mind.

903
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,878
You unleash crimes in this earth.

904
01:10:57,253 --> 01:11:00,552
Evil people lose their way even
when they are in the womb.

905
01:11:02,124 --> 01:11:04,058
l don't want to know what
you are going to do.

906
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,528
But whatever you have done
so far have not been effective.

907
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:07,219
That's it.

908
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:11,689
We are really confused now.

909
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:13,398
Both those killed were women.

910
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:16,130
One is a 65 year old widow...

911
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:18,632
...and the other one is a
24 year old unmarried woman.

912
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:21,805
One is an ordinary coffee pub owner.

913
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:24,205
The other one is a famous singer.

914
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:28,278
There is no common factor
which connects both of them.

915
01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:32,587
There will be a common factor among
the victims in such type of serial killings.

916
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:33,922
lt is missing here.

917
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:37,120
l doubt.

918
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:40,829
lf it is so, a religious text
or a note inscribed...

919
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:44,388
...with some sermons must
be there beside the body.

920
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,134
An alphabet book is something silly.

921
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:49,897
So what to do now?

922
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:52,467
We need to know more about Beena.

923
01:11:53,609 --> 01:12:01,414
A hot chick like Beena was ready to
travel in a car with someone at night.

924
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:03,076
To have a good time.

925
01:12:04,453 --> 01:12:09,083
That shows, she had some
sort of intimacy with him.

926
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,988
We have to find such a
man from her personal life.

927
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:15,893
Herfamily, friends, contact lists.

928
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:26,035
Susan...
- Sir.

929
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:28,103
That Jerome is your cousin, right?

930
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:31,408
He is your uncle's illegitimate son.

931
01:12:31,613 --> 01:12:32,409
Sir..that...

932
01:12:32,815 --> 01:12:37,013
Her uncle Peter is a little mischievous.

933
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:40,317
He has got good mafia
connections in Karnataka.

934
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:40,945
Hasn't he?

935
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:43,388
What do you mean?

936
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:47,655
To get information that there is a
mafia presence behind these killings.

937
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:50,294
To handover it to Kishore
as a valuable tip.

938
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:56,427
A big time gangster attack against
us when we did the follow up.

939
01:12:57,272 --> 01:12:59,536
lf he plans anything
like this in the future...

940
01:12:59,641 --> 01:13:02,508
...tell him to ask the free
time of the parish priest.

941
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:05,306
He might need a sacrament.

942
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:23,156
Who is Adarsh?

943
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:27,862
What is the matter?

944
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:39,141
l'm Kishore, from the police.

945
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:44,610
Aren't you the man in charge
of this band? - Yes.

946
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:47,845
l want to know certain things.

947
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:48,985
Want to know it immediately.

948
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,593
Had Beena Thomson
decided to leave this band?

949
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:56,831
She had such a wish.

950
01:13:57,032 --> 01:13:59,557
l requested her not to
take a quick decision.

951
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:00,724
Then?

952
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:04,637
Then, l told her not to make that public.

953
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:06,907
Because it will affect the
reputation of the band.

954
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:09,934
What you said is not completely true.

955
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:12,611
You were not requesting.

956
01:14:13,048 --> 01:14:15,414
But told her firmly that she
can't leave the band.

957
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:17,209
That..

958
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,080
Were you in love with her?

959
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:22,753
Shall we go?

960
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:23,852
Where to?

961
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:24,950
Let's go.

962
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,527
Let me say..
- Move.

963
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:27,518
Walk.

964
01:14:31,433 --> 01:14:33,298
Some information we need is with him.

965
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:34,795
That's why l brought him here.

966
01:14:35,437 --> 01:14:37,769
As Beena's father said,
one thing is clear.

967
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,905
Beena was in love with someone.

968
01:14:40,075 --> 01:14:42,168
She wanted to marry him.

969
01:14:42,845 --> 01:14:48,477
She might have gone to that
lonely place with him.

970
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:51,383
Some girls don't take marriage seriously.

971
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:53,450
lf she feels attracted
to some other guy...

972
01:14:53,555 --> 01:14:55,045
...she may spend some
happy time with him.

973
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:56,249
That's also possible.

974
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:57,552
This one is not like that.

975
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:00,055
Beena had kept her affair very secretly.

976
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:04,063
So, her meetings with her lover
also must have been secretly.

977
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:07,694
Her lover was with her that night.

978
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:09,095
l'm sure about it.

979
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:12,099
And that means, her lover is her killer.

980
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:15,106
Who is he?

981
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:18,470
He can give some hint
regarding that person.

982
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:21,274
He was madly in love with her.

983
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:25,843
You know a lot about the inner
details of these night riders.

984
01:15:26,822 --> 01:15:27,413
How is it?

985
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:31,783
My friend Bindya is a fan of this troupe.

986
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:34,420
She attended Beena's last program also.

987
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:38,291
Oh Bindya! Your friend!

988
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:39,924
Yes.

989
01:15:40,068 --> 01:15:41,160
You have great friend!

990
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:43,403
She will be present in all crucial points.

991
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:44,535
As a witness.

992
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:47,301
What else did she say?

993
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:52,279
l have recorded whatever she said.

994
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:09,827
Very interesting!

995
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:24,604
You along with Beena and two other
friends started this troupe...5 years back.

996
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:25,672
Yes.

997
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:30,480
Beens decided to leave the
troupe 4 months back. Why?

998
01:16:31,053 --> 01:16:32,577
l don't know the exact reason.

999
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:34,446
l will ask sir.

1000
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:35,980
Should he ask?

1001
01:16:36,525 --> 01:16:37,150
No sir.

1002
01:16:38,327 --> 01:16:42,286
Beena was in love with someone.

1003
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:45,758
Her plan was to settle somewhere
abroad aftertheir wedding.

1004
01:16:46,535 --> 01:16:47,331
Who is that person?

1005
01:16:47,536 --> 01:16:48,264
l don't know.

1006
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:50,064
What l say is true..l don't know.

1007
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:51,636
So, you were really disappointed...

1008
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:53,173
...because of her love
affair with another man.

1009
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:55,241
ls it right?

1010
01:16:56,078 --> 01:16:57,136
Were you in love with her?

1011
01:17:01,249 --> 01:17:04,184
l was trying to convince her.

1012
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:07,485
But she was avoiding me.

1013
01:17:08,023 --> 01:17:11,390
Notjust me, but many others also.

1014
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:13,687
She was a flirt.

1015
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:17,330
Entertaining everyone, but without letting
anyone know what is in her mind...

1016
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:19,396
You know what l mean.

1017
01:17:19,768 --> 01:17:21,827
At last got connected with someone.

1018
01:17:21,937 --> 01:17:22,528
- Yes sir.

1019
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:24,536
But she nevertold anyone about him.

1020
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:27,232
She only told that they would be
getting married the next month.

1021
01:17:27,743 --> 01:17:31,577
The lyrics of the song she sang the
night before her murder was changed.

1022
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:32,570
Why?

1023
01:17:36,218 --> 01:17:38,083
Your friend told you about this.

1024
01:17:38,954 --> 01:17:40,114
lt has been recorded in the phone.

1025
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:44,688
Since you didn't feel it that
important, you didn't care.

1026
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:51,889
Tell me, who changed the
lyrics of this popular number?

1027
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,033
lt was Beena who did it.
l don't know why she did it.

1028
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:57,771
But there was a quarrel
between us on this issue.

1029
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,304
Our last quarrel!

1030
01:18:05,914 --> 01:18:06,505
Beena..

1031
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:07,715
Yes, l'm here.

1032
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:09,908
How is the show going?

1033
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:12,017
Yeah, good. lt's happening today.

1034
01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:21,260
Wait...wait...wait...

1035
01:18:22,164 --> 01:18:22,892
Just rewind.

1036
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:32,004
There was a salesman with Beena.

1037
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:32,866
- Yes sir.

1038
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:34,099
Rasheed...
- Sir.

1039
01:18:34,342 --> 01:18:36,173
On the day of the
murder of Alice also...

1040
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:38,246
...there was the presence
of a salesman, right?

1041
01:18:38,313 --> 01:18:39,041
Yes sir.

1042
01:18:40,348 --> 01:18:44,876
At last a link...a common factor.

1043
01:19:05,941 --> 01:19:07,966
Why do you purchase
from men like this?

1044
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:09,771
All must be fake products.

1045
01:19:21,523 --> 01:19:23,184
l came to ask you one thing.
- What?

1046
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:25,122
Who gave you permission to
change the lyrics that l have written.

1047
01:19:27,362 --> 01:19:28,386
l didn't ask for anyone's permission.

1048
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:31,298
The lines of a huge hit number
that everyone is familiar with..

1049
01:19:31,867 --> 01:19:33,357
...changing it like you wish....

1050
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:40,867
Was it because of your lyrics or my
music that the song became a hit?

1051
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:45,906
Those who heard the new lines said,
it is betterthan the previous one.

1052
01:19:50,218 --> 01:19:52,448
Nonsense is not entertained here.

1053
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,446
Yes it can be entertained.

1054
01:19:55,157 --> 01:19:57,057
l continue here because
you begged me to stay here.

1055
01:19:57,659 --> 01:19:58,216
Don't forget that.

1056
01:19:58,727 --> 01:20:03,357
The face of yours as a frustrated
lover....it is really boring.

1057
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:14,001
The personal belongings of Beena
that we got from the car are here, right?

1058
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:15,200
Yes sir.

1059
01:20:21,349 --> 01:20:23,214
Any interesting data in this phone?

1060
01:20:23,418 --> 01:20:24,680
No photos or messages.

1061
01:20:24,953 --> 01:20:26,181
But there is a video clip.

1062
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:29,747
A person covering the lens
when Beena tries to shoot him.

1063
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:35,461
Okay. Let's have a projection.

1064
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:44,263
Play it again.
- Yes sir.

1065
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,550
lt's not good to read legal books only.

1066
01:21:01,056 --> 01:21:02,023
Try something like this.

1067
01:21:02,657 --> 01:21:03,453
lt's great fiction.

1068
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:07,552
lt's not my taste.

1069
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:10,831
The person who likes such things
is over there, my daughter.

1070
01:21:11,299 --> 01:21:14,894
She has her father's tastes
- literature, acting, music..

1071
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:20,305
lt seems you feel proud
to say about her father.

1072
01:21:20,742 --> 01:21:21,208
Do you feel like that?

1073
01:21:22,143 --> 01:21:22,700
Might be.

1074
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:41,153
l'm really sorry.
- lt's okay.

1075
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:49,232
What happened?

1076
01:21:49,404 --> 01:21:50,462
Nothing.

1077
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:52,096
l collided with an uncle.

1078
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:53,366
These books fell down.

1079
01:21:54,142 --> 01:21:55,040
Okay come.

1080
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:04,875
There is an important
breakthrough in our case.

1081
01:22:06,655 --> 01:22:11,456
So far, we thought that there is no
relation between Alice and Beena.

1082
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:19,290
But both murders are committed with
come specific aims and are connected.

1083
01:22:20,235 --> 01:22:22,533
Kishore, you play it again
and freeze on that mug.

1084
01:22:22,637 --> 01:22:23,194
Yes sir.

1085
01:22:30,312 --> 01:22:33,304
This was the mug used in
the coffee pub of Alice.

1086
01:22:34,316 --> 01:22:34,907
See this.

1087
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:45,081
When Beena shot this, the letters
A and L were out of the frame.

1088
01:22:45,827 --> 01:22:50,093
That means this was shot
in the coffee pub of Alice.

1089
01:22:50,332 --> 01:22:55,565
So, Beena and her secret lover
used to meet in that coffee pub.

1090
01:22:57,172 --> 01:22:58,571
After everyone leaves the pub.

1091
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:00,703
Keeping only Alice as witness.

1092
01:23:01,543 --> 01:23:03,909
This visual is shot in a night.

1093
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:07,611
''To the smell of coffee''

1094
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:12,980
''l want to walk with you
by the sea''

1095
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:19,423
The lines that Beena
changed in her last song.

1096
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:22,157
Look at the words that l have marked.

1097
01:23:22,263 --> 01:23:25,528
'Coffee', 'Sea', 'Wonderland'

1098
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:30,360
What is the image that the word
'wonderland' brings to our mind?

1099
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:33,200
The title of a very famous book.

1100
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:35,742
''Alice in wonderland''
- Yes.

1101
01:23:36,277 --> 01:23:38,905
'Wonderland', 'Coffee', 'Sea'

1102
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:42,373
The setting which reflects,
from the sub conscious...

1103
01:23:42,484 --> 01:23:45,885
...in the lines jotted down by Beena
is that of the coffee pub of Alice.

1104
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:51,288
So, the Beena's secret
lover is the one who killed...

1105
01:23:51,393 --> 01:23:57,025
...both Beena and Alice, who is the
only witness of their lover affair.

1106
01:24:00,935 --> 01:24:03,927
A Bangalore based prepaid
number is the most...

1107
01:24:04,005 --> 01:24:07,065
...frequently used
number in Beena's call list.

1108
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:08,603
Which was roaming in Kerala.

1109
01:24:09,144 --> 01:24:11,669
This number is in the
name of a taxi driver there.

1110
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:15,080
Calls have been made from this
numberto Alice's phone also.

1111
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:16,883
That number is switched off now.

1112
01:24:17,419 --> 01:24:19,319
After achieving his aim,
he gave up the number.

1113
01:24:19,621 --> 01:24:21,919
But some loose ends still exist.

1114
01:24:22,257 --> 01:24:25,226
The presence of a sales man
in the scene of murders.

1115
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:28,191
He hasn't gone to many places for sales.

1116
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:33,167
He sells products collected from
different places, of different brands.

1117
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:35,097
The name of his company is 'Mirage'.

1118
01:24:35,637 --> 01:24:36,626
Details are here sir.

1119
01:24:37,806 --> 01:24:39,364
The name and address are fake.

1120
01:24:39,774 --> 01:24:43,107
There is no doubt that he is the most
important link in these murders.

1121
01:24:44,045 --> 01:24:47,913
The meaning of the word
'mirage' is 'imaginary'.

1122
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:50,083
So what you suggest?

1123
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:53,652
This sales man is a character
created to mislead us.

1124
01:24:54,622 --> 01:24:57,455
Likewise, a serial killer who
kills in alphabetical series..

1125
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:03,355
But sir...will anyone do like this?

1126
01:25:03,731 --> 01:25:06,825
He could have committed these
murders simply and plainly.

1127
01:25:13,975 --> 01:25:14,566
Yes.

1128
01:25:16,678 --> 01:25:17,610
Yes, that's it.

1129
01:25:19,681 --> 01:25:23,208
There is fiction, exaggeration, mystery..

1130
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:26,548
There is a child's fecund
imagination which sees...

1131
01:25:26,654 --> 01:25:30,181
...these murders in the
backdrop of alphabetical series.

1132
01:25:30,592 --> 01:25:31,854
There is a challenge against me..

1133
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,929
He desperately wants me to
get involved in this. Why?

1134
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:40,531
But there is one thing.

1135
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:47,030
Now l know a lot of things about
this killer and his character.

1136
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:51,975
Now my gambits are
beyond his calculations.

1137
01:25:56,918 --> 01:25:58,715
Such an evening break
is very rare for me.

1138
01:25:59,053 --> 01:26:02,079
Only because your insistence...there
are so many clients in the office.

1139
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:05,986
Don't you feel bored always
listening to the legalities?

1140
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:10,627
Do you feel bored with the psychic
problems of your patients?

1141
01:26:10,765 --> 01:26:11,629
l leave that here.

1142
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,794
l can't win an argument with you.

1143
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:21,404
l wanted to ask you one
thing so many times.

1144
01:26:27,248 --> 01:26:29,910
Both of us have an uneasy past.

1145
01:26:31,486 --> 01:26:34,717
For you a broken marriage,
for me a failed love affair.

1146
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:36,288
But we are great friends.

1147
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:41,792
Two people who understand
each other very well.

1148
01:26:43,264 --> 01:26:47,724
My question is n can we go a
little further in our relationship?

1149
01:26:53,841 --> 01:26:54,865
What you said is correct.

1150
01:26:55,843 --> 01:26:56,832
We are great friends.

1151
01:26:58,279 --> 01:26:59,337
No need to go beyond that.

1152
01:27:00,848 --> 01:27:01,473
You are right.

1153
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:03,447
l have a broken marriage.

1154
01:27:04,652 --> 01:27:09,055
But l myself am not convinced
about the reasons behind that.

1155
01:27:10,358 --> 01:27:11,325
This is a confession.

1156
01:27:12,193 --> 01:27:14,354
A confession before a good psychiatrist.

1157
01:27:17,765 --> 01:27:22,168
lf there is a man in my life,
still he is the one.

1158
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:25,930
l understand.

1159
01:27:26,608 --> 01:27:27,506
Leave that.

1160
01:27:28,576 --> 01:27:31,704
When l told you this,
actually l feel relieved.

1161
01:27:32,747 --> 01:27:35,113
ln our language - talking cure.

1162
01:27:39,854 --> 01:27:41,617
Sorry.
- lt's all right.

1163
01:27:42,156 --> 01:27:44,147
There is nothing more
beautiful than failing...

1164
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:46,090
...in either a love affair or a revolution.

1165
01:27:46,561 --> 01:27:47,755
lt's a beautiful feeling.

1166
01:27:48,963 --> 01:27:49,486
Come.

1167
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:06,370
Okay.

1168
01:28:09,150 --> 01:28:10,913
You don't heed me now a days.

1169
01:28:11,185 --> 01:28:13,483
l called you twice and you promised
me that you would call back.

1170
01:28:13,588 --> 01:28:15,681
Why didn't you call me back?
- l was busy my daughter.

1171
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:17,255
O my God!

1172
01:28:17,392 --> 01:28:19,519
Have you become serious
in your profession?

1173
01:28:19,727 --> 01:28:20,216
Stop joking.

1174
01:28:22,063 --> 01:28:24,156
Our drama is on Wednesday.

1175
01:28:24,265 --> 01:28:25,755
You must come.
- Done.

1176
01:28:27,068 --> 01:28:32,233
l met an astrologer today.

1177
01:28:34,876 --> 01:28:38,607
He said our time is very bad.

1178
01:28:39,213 --> 01:28:42,273
So you should tie it to your chain.

1179
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:46,279
To prevent something
harmful from enemies.

1180
01:28:47,388 --> 01:28:48,514
Why are you like this?

1181
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:53,584
You do what l say.

1182
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:57,191
This one should be tied
to your mother's chain.

1183
01:28:57,832 --> 01:29:00,562
Even if she opposes you
should manage it.

1184
01:29:02,136 --> 01:29:03,262
Don't tell herthat l gave this.

1185
01:29:03,738 --> 01:29:04,727
You tell some lie.

1186
01:29:05,139 --> 01:29:06,629
Lying is a bad habit, right?

1187
01:29:07,275 --> 01:29:08,003
lt's bad.

1188
01:29:08,976 --> 01:29:12,070
But in some circumstances, if your
father asks you to do so, no problem.

1189
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:17,677
Will it happen in the nearfuture?

1190
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:19,486
What?

1191
01:29:19,854 --> 01:29:22,618
Will l be able to live
with both of you together?

1192
01:29:24,559 --> 01:29:27,357
Finish this and go home.

1193
01:29:29,664 --> 01:29:30,494
One minute..l will be right back.

1194
01:29:40,441 --> 01:29:41,066
Rasheed...

1195
01:29:45,813 --> 01:29:48,213
Her transmitter is active.

1196
01:29:53,087 --> 01:29:54,486
Deepthi's will be active from today night.

1197
01:29:55,723 --> 01:29:57,884
You should watch their movements.

1198
01:29:58,926 --> 01:30:00,791
Both of them should be
under our protection.

1199
01:30:01,028 --> 01:30:01,551
Okay?

1200
01:30:49,977 --> 01:30:52,377
Dear Chandrasekhar,
now the score is 2-0.

1201
01:30:52,547 --> 01:30:55,516
l can guess your present state of mind.

1202
01:30:55,817 --> 01:30:58,581
Do you feel that you
have been defeated?

1203
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:02,587
A very memorable experience
is awaiting you.

1204
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:05,520
The fire in the hell never ends.

1205
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:08,556
lt always burns the pyre of the sinners.

1206
01:31:08,763 --> 01:31:10,196
Date - March 1 .

1207
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:12,296
Place - Cheriyavathilkotta.

1208
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:14,435
With love and respect - Z

1209
01:31:25,813 --> 01:31:27,212
Sir..
- Hello Kishore.

1210
01:31:28,749 --> 01:31:30,410
Sir...March 1 ...

1211
01:31:31,052 --> 01:31:32,519
My God!
March 1 is today!

1212
01:31:32,987 --> 01:31:34,750
Place?
- Cheriyavathilkotta.

1213
01:31:35,189 --> 01:31:37,987
ls it not the place where you live?

1214
01:31:53,241 --> 01:31:53,764
Hello.

1215
01:32:10,458 --> 01:32:11,186
Bad luck sir.

1216
01:32:12,226 --> 01:32:13,284
The third killing also took place.

1217
01:32:13,661 --> 01:32:14,889
One Chandrika Narayanan.

1218
01:32:15,463 --> 01:32:16,930
Chandrika Narayan?
- Yes sir.

1219
01:32:17,231 --> 01:32:18,198
The MD of fortune group.

1220
01:32:18,766 --> 01:32:20,233
The murder took place in her office.

1221
01:32:20,468 --> 01:32:22,026
lt's hardly 1 .5 km from here.

1222
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:23,698
Come, let's go.
- Yes sir.

1223
01:33:34,842 --> 01:33:36,969
C for Chandrika.

1224
01:33:50,391 --> 01:33:51,653
This is madam's guest house.

1225
01:33:51,759 --> 01:33:54,387
She relaxes here till evening some days.

1226
01:33:54,562 --> 01:33:55,722
No security staff here?

1227
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:59,529
One is here. But he has
been on leave for 2 days.

1228
01:34:00,434 --> 01:34:03,926
Was there any special reason forthe
madam to come here today evening?

1229
01:34:04,271 --> 01:34:05,636
She told me she had a visitor.

1230
01:34:05,973 --> 01:34:07,634
Did she tell who that visitor was?

1231
01:34:07,942 --> 01:34:08,431
No.

1232
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:10,372
She doesn't tell everything to us.

1233
01:34:11,012 --> 01:34:12,707
Did a salesman come here today?

1234
01:34:12,913 --> 01:34:15,473
With some cosmetic products
- a door to door seller.

1235
01:34:15,549 --> 01:34:16,311
Yes.

1236
01:34:30,364 --> 01:34:31,524
Deal with him.
- Yes sir.

1237
01:34:36,637 --> 01:34:38,264
Here are some visuals.

1238
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:41,199
Tell me whetherthat salesman
is among these. - Yes.

1239
01:34:42,743 --> 01:34:44,301
''Who are you?''

1240
01:34:44,712 --> 01:34:49,513
Fortune is a business group which
had a turnover of 57 crores last year.

1241
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:52,212
Chandrika Narayan was
a brilliant business women.

1242
01:34:52,853 --> 01:34:55,378
She has been living separated from
her husband for nearly 12 years.

1243
01:34:55,556 --> 01:34:57,148
She has a son.
He is in the US.

1244
01:34:57,324 --> 01:34:58,552
We have mailed him.

1245
01:35:03,064 --> 01:35:03,621
Sir..

1246
01:35:03,998 --> 01:35:05,056
ldentified the person.

1247
01:35:11,272 --> 01:35:12,330
l want him Rasheed.

1248
01:35:13,174 --> 01:35:14,300
l want him badly.

1249
01:35:15,242 --> 01:35:16,368
He will be nabbed.

1250
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:21,541
lf l'm wrong, please pardon.

1251
01:35:22,149 --> 01:35:24,617
No result so far in his investigation.

1252
01:35:29,123 --> 01:35:32,490
Don't mix up your personal
grudge against me in this case.

1253
01:35:32,927 --> 01:35:34,690
Jerome has no personal
connection with this case.

1254
01:35:36,797 --> 01:35:39,630
Today's letter was not addressed
to the office. But to my home.

1255
01:35:40,101 --> 01:35:41,966
By the time, l read it, the
murder had taken place.

1256
01:35:42,403 --> 01:35:45,395
He sent that letterto
my home to delay...

1257
01:35:45,506 --> 01:35:50,273
...any preparation from
us to stop that murder.

1258
01:35:51,145 --> 01:35:53,010
The killer had decided that
the news of this killing...

1259
01:35:53,147 --> 01:35:55,377
...should reach me only
after the murder took place.

1260
01:35:55,449 --> 01:35:56,006
Why?

1261
01:35:56,517 --> 01:35:59,281
For him, the most
important killing was this.

1262
01:36:00,054 --> 01:36:02,955
He was hell bent on
executing this without fail.

1263
01:36:03,324 --> 01:36:04,018
Exactly.

1264
01:36:05,159 --> 01:36:09,425
Now l know why he got
me involved in this game.

1265
01:36:10,931 --> 01:36:13,331
l know who he is going to kill next.

1266
01:36:14,435 --> 01:36:15,265
l know everything.

1267
01:36:15,836 --> 01:36:16,803
Then you tell me.

1268
01:36:19,874 --> 01:36:23,105
The date forthe first murder was feb 10.

1269
01:36:24,245 --> 01:36:26,213
Didn't l tell - it's a bad day for me.

1270
01:36:27,348 --> 01:36:28,906
That day l got divorce.

1271
01:36:32,153 --> 01:36:37,113
The professional clashes between
me and Deepthi reached it's...

1272
01:36:37,224 --> 01:36:43,254
...culmination related to a murder that
happened in this city 10 years back.

1273
01:36:44,398 --> 01:36:45,990
lt was visibly a suicide.

1274
01:36:46,167 --> 01:36:47,862
But l was sure that it was a murder.

1275
01:36:48,769 --> 01:36:52,705
Chandrika who has been killed
today was the main suspect.

1276
01:36:56,677 --> 01:37:00,613
Paul Mathew was the
wealthiest NRl in the city.

1277
01:37:00,815 --> 01:37:03,215
He died because of poisoning.

1278
01:37:03,584 --> 01:37:06,109
l had doubt that it was a murder.

1279
01:37:06,487 --> 01:37:14,087
Paul who made a fortune abroad,
didn't have close relatives here.

1280
01:37:14,228 --> 01:37:15,058
He was a bachelor.

1281
01:37:15,362 --> 01:37:18,889
He had sexual relation with
Chandrika Narayaanan.

1282
01:37:19,099 --> 01:37:22,262
He helped Chandrika financially.

1283
01:37:22,469 --> 01:37:24,232
But when Paul started asking
for the money back...

1284
01:37:24,305 --> 01:37:26,432
...problems started in their relationship.

1285
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:30,301
l had information that
Chandrika was with Paul...

1286
01:37:30,411 --> 01:37:33,812
...20 minutes before Paul was poisoned.

1287
01:37:33,948 --> 01:37:40,251
There was enough evidence
to suspect Cahndrika.

1288
01:37:40,487 --> 01:37:43,979
l shared my doubts and
deductions with Deepthi.

1289
01:37:44,225 --> 01:37:46,955
Such discussions were
common among us.

1290
01:37:47,061 --> 01:37:51,657
Next day l sent for Chandrika to
the guest house for interrogation.

1291
01:37:51,765 --> 01:37:56,759
Her response was as if she had
foreseen all my movements.

1292
01:37:57,137 --> 01:38:00,300
She had an alibi and
other details which...

1293
01:38:00,441 --> 01:38:03,899
...protected her from being
implicated in the case.

1294
01:38:04,044 --> 01:38:09,209
lt was a startling realization for
me that her lawyer was Deepthi.

1295
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:12,451
l lost control when
l came to know that...

1296
01:38:12,519 --> 01:38:17,320
...she betrayed me for her
professional success.

1297
01:38:21,495 --> 01:38:22,189
Would you like to have tea?

1298
01:38:28,369 --> 01:38:29,199
You should not cheat.

1299
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:31,301
You should not cheat
me when we live together.

1300
01:40:32,393 --> 01:40:34,224
Father, what should l do now?

1301
01:40:35,062 --> 01:40:37,690
Police will find you at any moment.

1302
01:40:37,865 --> 01:40:40,356
Then arrest, trial, punishment....

1303
01:40:40,768 --> 01:40:44,397
But these are the
usual ways of this world.

1304
01:40:44,872 --> 01:40:48,171
You should dedicate
yourself before God.

1305
01:40:48,275 --> 01:40:50,800
He will absolve you.

1306
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:52,376
l know that.

1307
01:40:52,913 --> 01:40:54,380
The inferno is waiting for me.

1308
01:40:55,049 --> 01:40:56,710
The inferno is waiting for me.

1309
01:40:57,317 --> 01:41:00,115
l will tell you where to go.

1310
01:41:00,454 --> 01:41:02,922
You have one more job to finish.

1311
01:41:03,157 --> 01:41:04,818
The death of a sinner.

1312
01:41:05,392 --> 01:41:07,292
Yes father.

1313
01:41:55,642 --> 01:41:58,008
Left turn from the next junction.

1314
01:42:10,924 --> 01:42:11,686
Excuse-me.

1315
01:42:16,563 --> 01:42:17,860
l need to talk to you.

1316
01:42:19,066 --> 01:42:19,794
Please come with me.

1317
01:42:33,447 --> 01:42:34,379
What should l do?

1318
01:42:37,818 --> 01:42:38,682
You should tell the truth.

1319
01:42:41,255 --> 01:42:43,018
l knew one thing
from the very beginning.

1320
01:42:43,423 --> 01:42:48,190
Whoever is doing these murders, he
has something to communicate to me.

1321
01:42:49,630 --> 01:42:54,363
He has some aim in
getting me involved in this.

1322
01:42:56,436 --> 01:42:59,928
There is a close relationship
between Alice and Beena.

1323
01:43:01,208 --> 01:43:04,700
l want to know about their
relationship with Chandrika.

1324
01:43:06,246 --> 01:43:12,549
Do Alice and Beena have any
connection with the murder of Paul?

1325
01:43:13,854 --> 01:43:17,585
The mystery of these murders lies
in the answer to these questions.

1326
01:43:26,633 --> 01:43:29,466
That evening, my senior
Vaidyanadhan...

1327
01:43:29,570 --> 01:43:32,061
...asked me to help Chandrika
quite unexpectedly.

1328
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:37,308
Chandrika convinced me that
she was innocent in that case...

1329
01:43:37,377 --> 01:43:41,108
...but the police was
unnecessarily suspecting her.

1330
01:43:41,648 --> 01:43:45,709
l could help her easily because
l had information from Chandra...

1331
01:43:45,786 --> 01:43:49,847
...about the way police was
going to interrogate her.

1332
01:43:50,657 --> 01:43:53,217
The zealous adventure of a
beginner to become famous.

1333
01:43:55,229 --> 01:43:59,165
But it took years to understand
that it was cheating.

1334
01:44:00,334 --> 01:44:04,236
When l took up two more cases of
her, l came to know her more closely.

1335
01:44:06,039 --> 01:44:09,406
l got an idea on how Paul died.

1336
01:44:09,776 --> 01:44:13,507
Alice, who was running a small
textile shop in Fort Kochi...

1337
01:44:13,614 --> 01:44:16,310
...was an accomplice of Chandrika.

1338
01:44:16,817 --> 01:44:17,715
A pimp.

1339
01:44:18,318 --> 01:44:20,183
They exploited the weakness of Paul.

1340
01:44:21,255 --> 01:44:27,353
Beena, who was 16 year old then,
was procured by Chandrika for Paul.

1341
01:44:28,328 --> 01:44:30,319
Then Chandrika, Alice and Beena...

1342
01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:35,732
...together formed a sex racket that
started black mailing their customers.

1343
01:44:40,073 --> 01:44:44,009
lt is a mischief from you a year
back...you know it, right?

1344
01:44:44,745 --> 01:44:45,871
Beena is a minor.

1345
01:44:47,147 --> 01:44:49,980
These photos, VCDs and
then her deposition.

1346
01:44:50,984 --> 01:44:52,315
Your life is wasted.

1347
01:44:53,220 --> 01:44:55,188
But nothing like that will happen.

1348
01:44:55,789 --> 01:44:57,654
She will obey whatever l say.

1349
01:44:58,825 --> 01:45:02,556
The money you gave me can
be considered as a ransom.

1350
01:45:07,668 --> 01:45:10,501
l thought you loved me.

1351
01:45:11,138 --> 01:45:12,036
Very sorry Paul.

1352
01:45:12,739 --> 01:45:15,708
Love and marriage are not meant to me.

1353
01:45:16,777 --> 01:45:18,210
Those are just an eye wash.

1354
01:45:19,179 --> 01:45:20,908
What l need is..money.

1355
01:45:22,683 --> 01:45:24,844
You damned......

1356
01:45:25,619 --> 01:45:31,319
l have treaded a very dangerous
path from an impoverished...

1357
01:45:31,391 --> 01:45:38,388
...local Christian to a glob
trotting businessman.

1358
01:45:39,032 --> 01:45:46,131
l need not give you a bribe of 1 crore
68 lakh for keeping my future safe.

1359
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:46,830
Did you understand?

1360
01:45:47,474 --> 01:45:53,106
You, along with that minor and
Alice gave me excellent pleasure.

1361
01:45:53,547 --> 01:45:54,206
l agreed.

1362
01:45:54,648 --> 01:45:57,082
Deduct 18 lakh forthat.

1363
01:45:57,551 --> 01:46:01,282
The remaining 1 .5 crore
should be returned.

1364
01:46:01,455 --> 01:46:02,012
Understood?

1365
01:46:03,323 --> 01:46:04,984
lf not, l will finish you off.

1366
01:46:05,125 --> 01:46:06,558
l have done the same before.

1367
01:46:17,104 --> 01:46:19,902
l had only one way before me.

1368
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:22,474
To annihilate Paul.

1369
01:46:23,443 --> 01:46:26,606
Alice and Beena encouraged me.

1370
01:46:27,547 --> 01:46:31,176
After some negotiations l became
attached to him once again.

1371
01:46:32,018 --> 01:46:34,179
A murder which should
appear like a suicide.

1372
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:41,218
l had to do it.

1373
01:46:42,863 --> 01:46:51,896
Because of us, Alice and Beena.. they
are also involved in all these as partners.

1374
01:46:52,339 --> 01:46:54,671
Because of us, your life is spoiled.

1375
01:46:56,109 --> 01:46:56,871
Really sorry.

1376
01:46:58,779 --> 01:47:05,014
At first, l wanted to confess before you.

1377
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:09,914
lt had been 3 years since we parted.

1378
01:47:11,324 --> 01:47:17,126
Pride..ego..l don't know which
stopped me from doing so.

1379
01:47:18,632 --> 01:47:22,193
Moreover l was scared
of Chandrika's reaction.

1380
01:47:23,437 --> 01:47:25,530
Ego, pride, fear..

1381
01:47:26,773 --> 01:47:30,675
For the life we lost, we can
explain these as reasons.

1382
01:47:32,612 --> 01:47:36,173
But our daughter was denied
the security of a family.

1383
01:47:36,950 --> 01:47:38,076
Have you everthought about that?

1384
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:42,852
Leave it...this is not the
appropriate time for such talks.

1385
01:47:43,890 --> 01:47:45,448
So, everything is clear now.

1386
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:50,226
All the three women who were killed
were behind Paul Mathew's murder.

1387
01:47:54,067 --> 01:47:56,592
For such revenge...

1388
01:47:57,404 --> 01:48:00,066
...there should be someone here
who is closely related to Paul.

1389
01:48:01,241 --> 01:48:02,003
Such a person..

1390
01:48:02,509 --> 01:48:03,100
There is.

1391
01:48:03,944 --> 01:48:07,175
A person who patiently waited
for 10 years to take revenge.

1392
01:48:07,547 --> 01:48:13,850
A person who created the image
of a serial killer who kills based of...

1393
01:48:13,954 --> 01:48:20,917
...alphabetical order...a person who
challenged me through letters.

1394
01:48:23,129 --> 01:48:25,097
He is not another ordinary killer.

1395
01:48:26,433 --> 01:48:30,597
But a person having a strange state
of mind that can see murder as a game.

1396
01:48:32,339 --> 01:48:33,738
He is very dangerous.

1397
01:48:37,277 --> 01:48:40,303
Even if you don't tell me,
l know the climax of this story.

1398
01:48:42,249 --> 01:48:45,047
The woman who saved the
murderer of Paul will also be punished.

1399
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:49,218
l'm going to be killed next, right?

1400
01:48:50,857 --> 01:48:51,755
D for Deepthi.

1401
01:48:52,259 --> 01:48:54,386
No..nothing will happen like that.

1402
01:48:56,062 --> 01:48:57,529
l...No.

1403
01:48:59,599 --> 01:49:00,657
We are around here.

1404
01:49:05,372 --> 01:49:06,805
ls this going to save me?

1405
01:49:09,109 --> 01:49:09,734
May be.

1406
01:49:11,645 --> 01:49:13,613
When did you start
believing in such things?

1407
01:49:17,517 --> 01:49:18,677
When l started failing.

1408
01:49:38,338 --> 01:49:39,270
Don't you want to see our daughter?

1409
01:49:41,308 --> 01:49:43,868
No..l will meet her when l come to
her school fortomorrow's drama.

1410
01:49:46,046 --> 01:49:47,775
Good night.
- Good night.

1411
01:50:04,464 --> 01:50:06,432
Good evening ladies and gentleman.

1412
01:50:07,233 --> 01:50:09,793
A very happy welcome to all of you.

1414
01:50:28,388 --> 01:50:29,412
Dear Chandrasekhar.

The end game begins now.

1416
01:50:31,157 --> 01:50:32,385
Right now, right here.

1417
01:50:32,726 --> 01:50:33,420
The detail...

1418
01:50:33,727 --> 01:50:35,627
Now you know why l'm
playing this game with you.

1419
01:50:35,795 --> 01:50:37,695
Save your queen if you can.

1420
01:50:37,831 --> 01:50:38,798
l've arrived.

1421
01:50:39,232 --> 01:50:41,462
Mate, it's going to be a checkmate now.

1422
01:50:44,270 --> 01:50:46,135
We can contact the cyber cell.

1423
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:47,762
The id from which this
mail has been sent.. - Time!

1424
01:50:48,341 --> 01:50:49,535

01:53:54,494 --> 01:53:55,256
Open the door.

1439
01:53:56,462 --> 01:53:57,224
Open the door.

1440
01:54:00,133 --> 01:54:00,895
Open the door.

1441
01:54:03,203 --> 01:54:04,192
Hey...No.

1442
01:54:04,737 --> 01:54:05,294
No...no.

1443
01:54:06,072 --> 01:54:06,538
No.

1444
01:54:08,308 --> 01:54:08,967
Relax.

1445
01:54:33,766 --> 01:54:34,528
Relax.

1446
01:54:46,346 --> 01:54:46,971
Please.

1447
01:54:48,147 --> 01:54:48,704
Please.

1448
01:54:48,948 --> 01:54:50,074
No...no.

1449
01:54:50,583 --> 01:54:51,277
No..

1450
01:54:52,385 --> 01:54:54,216
Leave me alone...leave me alone.

1451
01:55:49,475 --> 01:55:49,941
No.

1452
01:55:52,812 --> 01:55:53,278
No.

1453
01:55:58,851 --> 01:55:59,374
Victor...

1454
01:56:00,753 --> 01:56:01,481
Victor, listen.

1455
01:56:03,489 --> 01:56:04,478
What do you want?

1456
01:56:04,891 --> 01:56:06,119
l'll help you. Tell me.

1457
01:56:06,292 --> 01:56:07,384
No. You can't.

1458
01:56:08,728 --> 01:56:10,355
l don't want your kindness.

1459
01:56:14,667 --> 01:56:17,158
l don't believe in manmade laws.

1460
01:56:17,904 --> 01:56:21,499
l believe only in God's law and justice.

1461
01:56:24,110 --> 01:56:25,077
Please listen to what l say.

1462
01:56:26,145 --> 01:56:27,112
Please obey me.

1463
01:56:28,147 --> 01:56:30,012
l won't obey you.

1464
01:56:30,717 --> 01:56:32,082
l obey only God.

1465
01:56:32,652 --> 01:56:34,415
l obey only fatherAlexander.

1466
01:56:35,655 --> 01:56:36,747
Father Alexander?

1467
01:56:37,790 --> 01:56:38,449
Yes.

1468
01:56:42,061 --> 01:56:42,584
Yes.

1469
01:56:43,730 --> 01:56:44,662
Father Alexander.

1470
01:56:45,365 --> 01:56:48,027
FatherAlexander of St.Thomas church.

1471
01:56:50,970 --> 01:56:54,428
Did you kill Alice, Beena
and Chandrika?

1472
01:56:54,741 --> 01:56:56,572
Yes..it was me.

1473
01:56:58,378 --> 01:56:59,845
l don't remember anything.

1474
01:57:00,847 --> 01:57:02,678
Father told me that l had killed them.

1475
01:57:03,349 --> 01:57:04,373
That much be the truth.

1476
01:57:04,851 --> 01:57:05,749
l only killed them.

1477
01:57:06,085 --> 01:57:07,177
Yes. l did it.

1478
01:57:07,320 --> 01:57:08,309
Yes. l did it.

1479
01:57:09,222 --> 01:57:13,022
Didn't father tell you to go to
those three places for sales?

1480
01:57:13,292 --> 01:57:13,883
Yes.

1481
01:57:15,161 --> 01:57:19,962
After they were murdered father
told you that you had done that.

1482
01:57:21,734 --> 01:57:24,862
l don't remember anything.

1483
01:57:26,539 --> 01:57:29,872
What father told me that God's
wish was executed through me?

1484
01:57:31,144 --> 01:57:32,771
Those who died were sinners.

1485
01:57:34,547 --> 01:57:35,980
Lust is their sin.

1486
01:57:37,650 --> 01:57:38,810
One more remains.

1487
01:57:39,619 --> 01:57:41,246
The lastjob assigned
to me by the father.

1488
01:57:41,621 --> 01:57:42,679
She will die today.

1489
01:57:47,060 --> 01:57:48,027
Your ex-wife.

1490
01:57:53,833 --> 01:57:58,031
She will be punished for giving
up family for money and fame.

1491
01:57:59,072 --> 01:58:01,506
Yes..today it will be done.

1492
01:58:02,241 --> 01:58:04,766
Do you know who is always with her?.

1493
01:58:06,345 --> 01:58:09,872
That man...one who made me mad.

1494
01:58:10,650 --> 01:58:12,140
l was after him.

1495
01:58:14,821 --> 01:58:16,482
That woman who cheated you...

1496
01:58:16,589 --> 01:58:19,285
...who is still cheating you is
going to be punished by God.

1497
01:58:20,226 --> 01:58:21,250
Are you not happy?

1498
01:58:31,437 --> 01:58:31,926
No.

1499
01:58:59,665 --> 01:59:00,427
Move aside.

1500
01:59:04,637 --> 01:59:05,331
Move aside.

1501
01:59:05,605 --> 01:59:06,162
Move

1502
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:08,207
Move..move.

1503
01:59:09,375 --> 01:59:10,034
Move aside.

1504
01:59:19,118 --> 01:59:20,983
l know him.

1505
01:59:21,387 --> 01:59:21,944
l know.

1506
01:59:22,455 --> 01:59:23,114
You know him.

1507
01:59:23,890 --> 01:59:26,222
He was your patient
at Nimhans hospital.

1508
01:59:28,327 --> 01:59:30,921
He has been missing since Feb 10 2011 .

1509
01:59:33,266 --> 01:59:33,755
- Yes.

1510
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:36,532
How do you know all these?
- lt's none of your business.

1511
01:59:37,770 --> 01:59:38,566
Even then l will tell you.

1512
01:59:39,238 --> 01:59:48,909
Ever since we recognized him from
his photograph, we explored his history.

1513
01:59:49,148 --> 01:59:52,845
As per the medical records he was
suffering from serious schizophrenia.

1514
01:59:53,152 --> 01:59:57,987
He had a fixation
towards God, religion etc.

1515
01:59:58,558 --> 01:59:59,183
You are right.

1516
02:00:00,793 --> 02:00:09,826
Don't you think that a priest, may
not be a real one, can influence his...

1517
02:00:10,036 --> 02:00:18,808
...sub conscience mind and make
him obey whatever he orders?

1518
02:00:19,278 --> 02:00:20,176
ls it not possible?

1519
02:00:20,746 --> 02:00:22,008
lt's possible.

1520
02:00:22,248 --> 02:00:28,209
Beena's lover used to call her from
a Bangalore based prepaid number.

1521
02:00:28,454 --> 02:00:30,979
Alice had also received
calls from that number.

1522
02:00:32,058 --> 02:00:34,253
lt is clear that the killer has
a Bangalore connection.

1523
02:00:35,494 --> 02:00:42,559
NlMHANS is also in Bangalore.

1524
02:00:43,669 --> 02:00:47,730
You quit the job in that hospital the
next day Victor was found missing.

1525
02:00:48,474 --> 02:00:51,773
By controlling his
sub-conscious mind...

1526
02:00:51,844 --> 02:00:55,712
...you have created
the myth of a serial killer.

1527
02:00:56,315 --> 02:00:57,509
What the hell do you mean?

1528
02:00:57,617 --> 02:01:01,348
l mean to say that you are the killerfor
whom we have been searching for.

1529
02:01:01,887 --> 02:01:02,444
No.

1530
02:01:07,326 --> 02:01:07,815
What?

1531
02:01:08,828 --> 02:01:10,921
l know why you have done all these.

1532
02:01:11,297 --> 02:01:13,663
Sir, let me explain.
- No.no.

1533
02:01:13,833 --> 02:01:15,960
Not here. l'm taking you.
Come with me.

1534
02:01:31,350 --> 02:01:31,907
Daughter...

1535
02:01:32,251 --> 02:01:32,876
Stop there.

1536
02:01:33,986 --> 02:01:34,816
Did you see Dakshayani?

1537
02:01:34,954 --> 02:01:35,648
No.

1538
02:03:32,471 --> 02:03:33,335
Mark Roshan..

1539
02:03:40,045 --> 02:03:41,569
Welcome to the stage.

1540
02:03:48,220 --> 02:03:52,657
Mark Roshan's identity is very
clearly written in your old passport.

1541
02:03:53,659 --> 02:03:57,925
Theekkoyi Narippattel Mathew
Vargheese's son Roshan Mathew.

1542
02:03:58,831 --> 02:04:03,165
The only brother of Paul Mathew
who was killed 11 years ago.

1543
02:04:04,069 --> 02:04:05,434
You are right Chandrasekhar.

1544
02:04:08,474 --> 02:04:12,570
You kept a drama
at the end of our game.

1545
02:04:18,551 --> 02:04:21,611
l countered it using a strategy.

1546
02:04:22,655 --> 02:04:23,417
'Gambit'

1547
02:04:24,190 --> 02:04:29,719
The tactics of sacrificing valuable
pieces to conquerthe opponent.

1548
02:04:34,600 --> 02:04:38,036
Gambit no.1 - the arrest of Dr. Jacob.

1549
02:04:38,471 --> 02:04:41,770
The strategy which convinced
you that l was totally mistaken.

1550
02:04:43,943 --> 02:04:50,678
Rasheed switched off the lights and
removed my daughterfrom here.

1551
02:04:52,751 --> 02:04:54,309
lt's me...Rasheed uncle.

1552
02:04:55,688 --> 02:05:00,148
My aim was to bring Deepthi back to
the school looking for her daughter.

1553
02:05:00,993 --> 02:05:04,759
l was placing the most
valuable piece in front of you.

1554
02:05:08,067 --> 02:05:11,195
All at the very climax of a drama
when went on as you expected.

1555
02:05:12,171 --> 02:05:18,633
When l put Deepthi in front
of you, you couldn't resist it.

1556
02:05:19,478 --> 02:05:20,638
You accepted the gambit.

1557
02:05:24,683 --> 02:05:25,547
You are defeated.

1558
02:05:26,352 --> 02:05:27,148
Checkmate!

1559
02:05:31,457 --> 02:05:34,324
These murders had a
Bangalore connection.

1560
02:05:34,827 --> 02:05:35,885
A prepaid number.

1561
02:05:36,562 --> 02:05:41,556
When Victor's identity was established,
you thought l would suspect Dr.Jacob.

1562
02:05:42,101 --> 02:05:43,830
But do you remember what
you once told me?

1563
02:05:44,336 --> 02:05:48,033
When doctor was working in NlMHANS,
l had conducted a camp for the patients.

1564
02:05:48,440 --> 02:05:51,967
Victor had also participated
in that theater workshop.

1565
02:05:53,045 --> 02:05:57,209
The only person who knows Victor other
than Dr. Jacob - that is Mark Roshan.

1566
02:05:58,250 --> 02:06:01,447
Your personality matched
with my notion...

1567
02:06:01,554 --> 02:06:05,422
...of a murder that mixes
high drama in his actions.

1568
02:06:06,258 --> 02:06:07,122
Your native place?

1569
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:09,221
Original place is Wayanad.

1570
02:06:09,662 --> 02:06:12,096
When you lied that you
hailed from Wayand...

1571
02:06:12,197 --> 02:06:14,563
...my suspicion was strengthened.

1572
02:06:15,367 --> 02:06:17,597
When it was clearthat you are
the brother of Paul Mathew...

1573
02:06:17,703 --> 02:06:20,604
...l was ready forthe end game.

1574
02:06:21,006 --> 02:06:23,270
Yes..yes.

1575
02:06:26,946 --> 02:06:28,072
Hear my people.

1576
02:06:28,948 --> 02:06:31,178
Paul Mathew was my brother.

1577
02:06:32,084 --> 02:06:35,451
No..he was like a father for me.

1578
02:06:36,188 --> 02:06:38,588
For me my brother, my brother for me.

1579
02:06:40,693 --> 02:06:42,024
She came in between that.

1580
02:06:43,195 --> 02:06:43,923
Chandrika!

1581
02:06:44,530 --> 02:06:48,330
When he realized her real character,
my brother called me over phone.

1582
02:06:48,601 --> 02:06:49,499
This is your brother.

1583
02:06:50,636 --> 02:06:52,263
Didn't l tell you about
a marriage proposal?

1584
02:06:53,405 --> 02:06:54,269
lt won't happen.

1585
02:06:54,840 --> 02:06:55,738
She is a fraud.

1586
02:06:56,275 --> 02:06:58,573
Then l came to know about his death.

1587
02:07:00,079 --> 02:07:03,913
What could have done by an 18 year old
boy who lost everything all of a sudden?

1588
02:07:05,818 --> 02:07:07,979
l returned to lndia after 3 years.

1589
02:07:08,754 --> 02:07:10,221
l started digging the past.

1590
02:07:11,557 --> 02:07:14,151
Whenever l came back
that was my only aim.

1591
02:07:15,561 --> 02:07:20,658
At last l came to know that the reason
for my brother's death was three women.

1592
02:07:21,033 --> 02:07:23,593
They were saved from being
punished from another woman.

1593
02:07:27,139 --> 02:07:30,905
l got thrilled to note
that the names of these...

1594
02:07:31,010 --> 02:07:34,377
...four start with the alphabets A,B,C,D.

1595
02:07:40,052 --> 02:07:42,111
l kept on rewriting scripts.

1596
02:07:42,421 --> 02:07:45,254
That time l got Victor.

1597
02:07:46,058 --> 02:07:49,824
l created a serial killer who kills
based on alphabetical order.

1598
02:07:50,529 --> 02:07:54,056
The first phase of my script
was my relationship with Beena.

1599
02:07:54,333 --> 02:07:56,858
A love affair which was
strictly kept as a secret.

1600
02:07:57,236 --> 02:07:59,227
She believed that l would marry her.

1601
02:07:59,338 --> 02:08:01,704
Just like my brother trusted Chandrika.

1602
02:08:02,241 --> 02:08:05,506
l selected Alice coffee pub to meet her.

1603
02:08:05,944 --> 02:08:10,847
l made a close friendship with Chandrika
who was running a cultural forum.

1604
02:08:11,316 --> 02:08:13,409
l became Father Alexander
in front of Victor...

1605
02:08:13,519 --> 02:08:16,317
...who eloped from the
hospital on my insistence.

1606
02:08:16,655 --> 02:08:19,283
l sent him to Alice,
Beena and Chandrika...

1607
02:08:19,391 --> 02:08:23,259
...as a salesman of an
imaginary company.

1608
02:08:23,595 --> 02:08:26,120
Then came the moment
for which l was waiting.

1609
02:08:26,565 --> 02:08:27,327
Where is Beena?

1610
02:08:27,499 --> 02:08:28,227
She is coming.

1611
02:08:35,841 --> 02:08:39,072
When l said that l was Paul's brother...

1612
02:08:39,178 --> 02:08:42,579
...she was startled even
at the time of her death.

1613
02:08:53,025 --> 02:08:56,085
A night drive with
Beena after the program.

1614
02:08:56,862 --> 02:08:59,990
My love gift to her was a red scarf.

1615
02:09:00,966 --> 02:09:02,991
A strangling of death.

1616
02:09:08,841 --> 02:09:09,933
At last Chandrika.

1617
02:09:13,645 --> 02:09:17,775
l convinced Victor that he
had done all these murders.

1618
02:09:18,250 --> 02:09:22,311
Then directed him to kill
Deepthi as the last assignment.

1619
02:09:22,821 --> 02:09:25,847
l was sure that he would fail in it.

1620
02:09:26,859 --> 02:09:31,262
The last murder after offering serial
killer who confesses his crimes.

1621
02:09:31,930 --> 02:09:32,658
Deepthi.

1622
02:09:35,134 --> 02:09:38,103
l wanted you to be the main
character of this story...

1623
02:09:38,203 --> 02:09:40,839
...because you were the
one who lost a family life...

1624
02:09:40,839 --> 02:09:43,364
...only because you had realized
the truth behind my brother's death.

1625
02:09:44,543 --> 02:09:46,977
Moreover l didn't want
to miss the intoxication...

1626
02:09:47,045 --> 02:09:50,572
...one gets while playing
with an intelligent opponent.

1627
02:09:52,084 --> 02:09:57,852
A super cameo appearance of me, the
scenarist and director of this play.

1628
02:09:58,657 --> 02:09:59,521
ln the climax.

1629
02:10:00,659 --> 02:10:03,423
For the final act, for the final killing.

1630
02:10:04,596 --> 02:10:05,563
But l failed.

1631
02:10:08,033 --> 02:10:10,228
But a story will always have a twist.

1632
02:10:11,069 --> 02:10:12,969
One last minute turn around.

1633
02:11:41,627 --> 02:11:43,652
Crime rate is decreasing in Kochi.

1634
02:11:43,962 --> 02:11:45,327
MCSC is effective.

1635
02:11:45,430 --> 02:11:46,124
Really?

1636
02:11:47,032 --> 02:11:49,626
So, you are doing
great Chandrasekhar.

1637
02:12:05,384 --> 02:12:08,547
''You are like a wandering gust''

1638
02:12:08,854 --> 02:12:11,254
''You are a never ending rain in me..''

1639
02:12:12,257 --> 02:12:15,420
''You are the ultimate
meaning on this earth''

1640
02:12:15,727 --> 02:12:18,195
''You are burning embers in my heart..''

1641
02:12:19,731 --> 02:12:25,829
''My wings are tired and l'm
unsure about what is ahead..''

1642
02:12:26,138 --> 02:12:31,303
''Are you a lightening of love
which knows no bounds..''

1643
02:12:33,145 --> 02:12:36,171
''Who are you?''

1644
02:12:36,415 --> 02:12:39,612
''Who are you?''

1645
02:12:39,918 --> 02:12:42,910
''Who are you?''

1646
02:12:43,322 --> 02:12:46,291
''Who are you?''

1647
02:12:47,426 --> 02:12:48,893
''Who are you?''

1648
02:12:50,862 --> 02:12:52,193
''l'm searching..''

1649
02:12:54,333 --> 02:12:55,766
''You are rushing forward..''

1650
02:12:57,669 --> 02:12:58,897
''l'm singing..''

1651
02:13:01,907 --> 02:13:05,070
''You, as the darkness
of wandering shadow''

1652
02:13:05,444 --> 02:13:07,912
''Are an ever elusive tide?''

1653
02:13:08,947 --> 02:13:11,973
''Are you a wound in the eye?''

1654
02:13:12,351 --> 02:13:14,751
''Or the color of the evening sky?''

1655
02:13:16,021 --> 02:13:18,990
''Who are you?''

1656
02:13:19,324 --> 02:13:22,350
''Who are you?''

1657
02:13:22,728 --> 02:13:25,822
''Who are you?''

1658
02:13:26,164 --> 02:13:29,224
''Who are you?''

1659
02:13:30,202 --> 02:13:33,535
''Who are you?...Who are you?''

1660
02:13:33,638 --> 02:13:37,039
''l'm searching...l'm searching''

1661
02:13:37,175 --> 02:13:40,406
''You are rushing forward..
You are rushing forward..''

1662
02:13:40,512 --> 02:13:42,139
''l'm singing..''

1663
02:13:43,582 --> 02:13:46,517
''Who are you?''

1664
02:13:47,019 --> 02:13:49,920
''Who are you?''

1665
02:13:50,188 --> 02:13:53,123
''Who are you?''

1666
02:13:53,725 --> 02:13:55,659
''Who are you?''
