1
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:14,751
Sir Khitanwi

2
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:16,925
What do you say?

3
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:17,652
There was a Moulvi,

4
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:19,756
Do I look like a Nawab?

5
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:19,893
And Moulvi had a hen

6
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:21,858
Yes you are

7
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:23,598
That hen always abuses everyone

8
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:26,899
But... Your not
Yes

9
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:27,231
Even a scoudrel like me should shy

10
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,571
Moulvi was really upset with his hen

11
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:33,904
He went to his friend Qazi

12
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,981
and told him that my hen abuses
a lot so please do something

13
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:41,513
I have Madam's old jewellery

14
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:40,942
Qazi told him that bring her to me

15
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:42,949
I have two parrots,

16
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:44,751
His husban's turban

17
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,280
they use to pray all day long

18
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:46,789
Sword too

19
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:48,483
If she will stay with them so
she will be reformed

20
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:52,262
Moulvi left his hen to Qazi

21
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:50,089
Feel it

22
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:54,693
Qazi took the hen and...

23
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:56,864
Put her into the cage with
both parrots

24
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,436
When hen entered into cage

25
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,833
Both parrots were smiling

26
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,342
On the spot they quit praying

27
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,001
Your blood has the same shade

28
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,109
then one parrot whisper to
another parrot

29
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:07,942
Red

30
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:10,671
What is it?

31
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,408
May I whisper in your ears.

32
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:16,313
That I cant become the nawab
Of Mehmoodabad

33
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:20,481
What?

34
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,516
Till today

35
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,720
Who ever has taken birth

36
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,297
Has his own DNA

37
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:26,653
What did he said?

38
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,760
Diff rent from each other from
day one

39
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,531
Till now and onwards

40
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:34,227
He said stop praying our
prays are fulfilled

41
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:36,100
Wow

42
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,041
You have solved an old

43
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,571
This in injustice,

44
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,147
Mistry of mine

45
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,073
Meaning?

46
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,007
What are you doing?

47
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,949
There is a sevrage passage
In the centre of the city

48
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:46,947
Why you are taking Khalu's
revenge from me,

49
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,382
If I would have bad intention so
I would have flee

50
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:50,351
<i>Yes... near that there is a mention</i>

51
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:50,949
I didn't go anywhere,

52
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,914
Who is owned by Nawab Sahab

53
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,019
Look!

54
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:55,349
And the other side
Contains the city

55
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,593
Please trust me,

56
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:56,955
You guys are in hurry!

57
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,954
The other side of the
Sevrage passage

58
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,488
At least ask me my last wish

59
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,924
I used to walk down the streets

60
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:05,032
People used to bow down

61
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:04,563
You want to narrate me another joke

62
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:06,196
No!

63
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,394
With fear

64
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,137
Story!

65
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,375
And when Nawab sahab used to
walk down the streets

66
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,574
People used to bow down

67
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,543
With respect

68
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:21,909
Whatever it is

69
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,788
Tell me how can it be changed?

70
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:28,992
This is in born and can not be changed
Your kidding

71
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,722
One thousand Rupees daily,

72
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:34,093
<i>Now a days organ trasplants are commaâ€œ
But this does not change</i>

73
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,897
Did you tie Nawab inside this Sherwani

74
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,134
You are getting angry

75
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,570
These are the sherwanis of
real nawab

76
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:39,931
Thats why you are lying

77
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,768
He is gone for Hajj that's why you
can take them on rent

78
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,067
I have a lot of money

79
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,200
I'll give you what ever
You demand

80
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,206
If you want I'll pack both of them,
No!

81
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:49,176
Give some ordinary dress,

82
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:47,937
You sure

83
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:51,414
Its possible in Italy

84
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:51,875
Why?

85
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,884
We can try there

86
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,852
A servant is necessary with Nawab

87
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,151
You Nawab?
Yes!

88
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,484
We will both go there
When?

89
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:02,690
You wear anything but you will
look like a servant

90
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:03,926
As soon as I get merried to begum
We will fly First class

91
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,154
You are talking too much,

92
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,690
And if she does not merry you?

93
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:09,195
Since when they are shivering,
From few days

94
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,658
Then you will go by your self

95
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,859
In a coffin

96
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,126
His hands are shivering from many days

97
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,697
It's sunlight you should have see them
in morning

98
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,565
It's like earthquake,

99
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,005
You know what I do?

100
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:22,606

Would you like to meet him,

109
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,069

111
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,943

There are books everywhere

120
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:49,023
Nawab can't go to toilet,

121
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,225
Just have a look,

122
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,911

124
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,338

125
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:02,579
Why?

126
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,013
In Hyderabad(Pakistan)

127
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,043
Went on a evening walk

128
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,507

193
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,371

194
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,786

196
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,152
Not this

197
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,988
If I would have knew that Khalu
will betray me

198
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,355
then I would never come here

199
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:12,521
You wont be able to do so either

200
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:14,324
Lets go

201
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,131
You are famous for justice,

202
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,234
And I am your relative,

203
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:19,400
Show some mercy,

204
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:20,536
I am wanted in 5 states

205
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,506
100,000 is my head money

206
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,304
Japanese Gangsters cut the finger

207
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,271
On you

208
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,571
you can choose any finger,
You can take two fingers,

209
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:31,843
Spare my life,

210
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,068
Put your feet.

211
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:56,472
All ok?

212
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,710
It's tale from both sides,

213
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,842
Go and take a bath

214
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,269
This is cheating,

215
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:04,380
Go

216
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:15,352
What are you doing?

217
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,730
Wake up khalu

218
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,002
<i>The night has vanished braver</i>

219
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:32,298
Wake up please
Let me sleep

220
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,769
I have been awake all night
I am suffering from flue

221
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,743
Where were you all night?

222
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,053
What are you doing?

223
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:47,046
I swear I will blow up my head,

224
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,221
I was getting assaulted

225
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,118
You are doing wrong,

226
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:50,287
You get assaulted every now
and then

227
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,354
Thats not new

228
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,090
Give me your car's key.
Give me the money

229
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,623
So what happened?

230
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,857
You will be imprison for a
naive's murder.

231
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,864
I was gone to steal a neckless

232
00:10:58,624 --> 00:10:59,864
I will count on 3.

233
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,865
By God got a dimond inhand

234
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,066
lam alive but after 3 I will become
a ghost.

235
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:03,997
What did you do?

236
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:04,401
One!

237
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,310
Nothing but I will do

238
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:06,605
Two!

239
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,373
Plan is ready
What plan?

240
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,813
I am leaving,

241
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,245
Don't ask about the plan
Ask how much will we get

242
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,515
Minimum 50 million

243
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,380
You have cressed your limit

244
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,017
If you are in I will discuss
otherwise im not talking

245
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:26,329
Listen to me carefully

246
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:30,465
If you do anything wrong with Begum
I will kill you

247
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,366
Run!

248
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,640
I don't understand why you always
spare him.

249
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,772
I have seen you loose it in love
before

250
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,543
But madness is new for me

251
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,509
Did you hear about Batman,

252
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:49,319
Yes!

253
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,212
Thanks
For what?

254
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,086
If joker will die,

255
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,953
For letting me know

256
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,519
That I am nearing my goal

257
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,657
then what will batman do?

258
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,329
I am on the sixth stage of love

259
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:57,994
What?

260
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,988
He will make breads at home,

261
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:03,897
There are seven stages in love

262
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:04,260
Are you Joker?

263
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,176
Extremism meaning madness

264
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:21,410
When she will know the reality
about you

265
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,478
She will have your
Seven stages redifined

266
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:29,052
That will not happen
Why not?

267
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,760
Why not?

268
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,688
Because

269
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,490
This time

270
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,635
Its true love from my side

271
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,862
And her side

272
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:46,668

279
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:33,982
Greetings

280
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,867
Not many days are left

281
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,972
The state is waiting for your
announcment

282
00:13:59,104 --> 00:13:59,639
Begum

283
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,678
Before you decide

284
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:04,053
I want to

285
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,690
Let you know something

286
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,925
lam not what you think I am

287
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:20,063
I am pretending of being a Nawab

288
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,498
I knew that from day one

289
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,306
That you are not a Nawab by heart

290
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,976
You are mistaken

291
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:34,176
Actually I am not a Nawab at all

292
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:38,615
I lied about me
But you could not hide the truth too

293
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,747
Your a poet

294
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,555
True and divined

295
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:47,161
lam nothing of what you think
I am

296
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,030
I am a theif

297
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:51,992
I know

298
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:57,369
You have brought an end
to my past

299
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,403
You have given me a new life

300
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,708
I know that theif

301
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:14,654
I love it when you call me by my name

302
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,852
You will fight alone with world,

303
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,720
You are talking childish things.

304
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,119
Amazing!

305
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,124
please say it again

306
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:26,268
so he was the Nawab of Chandpur

307
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:30,466
And we are standing at Mehmoodabad
Railway Station

308
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:33,940
where all famous poets are
getting gather.

309
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,602
For annual competetion.

310
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:40,275
This competetion has organized by
Begum from Mehmoodabad in memory

311
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,180
of her late husband.

312
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:47,183
It was Nawab's last wish that Begum
must get marry

313
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,120
The Old man has gone mad

314
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:50,152
but only with a poet.

315
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,693
So what is the secret

316
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,387
that from last 3 years

317
00:15:54,553 --> 00:16:00,595
famous poets came from everywhere

318
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,971
and they are gone back with failure

319
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:07,534
So come let's pray

320
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:13,782
that in this year's competetion Begum
must find her Nawab.

321
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:46,704
May I have your attention!

322
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:50,604
I said May I have your attention!

323
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,978
You will discuss everything today

324
00:17:56,208 --> 00:18:01,817
My name is Muneera Aslam,

325
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:09,329
In few moments,
Begum Para...

326
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,831
is going to meet this gathering,

327
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:16,105
There are few things to requesting
to fulfill.

328
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:21,342
Please don't make any physical
contact with Begum,

329
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:24,914
and you are restricted to look
into her eyes.

330
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,473
She is so delicate

331
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:31,216
If somebody stare her longer so
she is gone under devil eye

332
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:38,590
that's why please avoid any kind of
bad behaviour.

333
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:44,632
So my guests!
Begum Para!

334
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,979
The day we all waited for

335
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,716
That day has arrived

336
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,743
What has happend to you

337
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,412
I am getting scared

338
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,249
What im doing

339
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:38,681
'S Tight?

340
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:42,889
He is Nawab, I am sorry
Nawab Jaanpur!

341
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,085
Its normal to be scared

342
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,089
Did you take your medication

343
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:00,471
I have seen you before,

344
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,643
When you remember then
must inform me

345
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,912
Let me fix your hair

346
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,281
I am also looking for myself
since long.

347
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:11,921
Don't be affraid

348
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:13,984
I am with you

349
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:20,897
Leave it all on God

350
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,428
Where is Noor Muhammed ltalvi,

351
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,889
Everything would be fine

352
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:28,536
He was with me till Kaanpur,

353
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:31,231
The whole state is wiating
for your verdict

354
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,167
I have seen him in train,

355
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,302
Waiting list is so long,

356
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,242
Let's go

357
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,209
but now on last moment,

358
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,674
It's hard to find a nice poet,

359
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,844
No!
It's not like that,

360
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,483
Our Mr. Jaan...

361
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:49,320
He can defeat any poet in competetion

362
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,385
He is kidding.

363
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,724
You are kidding,

364
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,593
Yesterday he narrated me a
great phrase.

365
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,198
What was the phrase?

366
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,340
Pajama's price is low here

367
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:15,310
Give me less water in wine

368
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,651
It's like...

369
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:30,800
There is a price of dress but
not for human

370
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,669
There is a price of dress but
not for human

371
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:44,704
Give me a bigger glass and
reduce the wine.

372
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,947
In the house of the Lord

373
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,545
All are equal

374
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,621
Tell me the next phrase of this
beautiful poetry.

375
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,157
<i>Late Nawab sahab took an 0th</i>

376
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:00,156
That after his death

377
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,757
I will give the state a new Nawab

378
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:05,124
It's not done yet.
I am working on it,

379
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,101
Still!

380
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,605
Now my age is over to get merried

381
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,100
It was like...

382
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:09,902
Nor my health

383
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:12,541
But I will have to keep my promise

384
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,741
Somebody throw his shoes.

385
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,533
That to in front of my Lord

386
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,306
Would be a huge sin

387
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:18,714
Today I

388
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,411
lnfront of all

389
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,175
Let's see who will narrate the
next phrase.

390
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,280
Would like to announce the new
Nawab of Mehmoodabad

391
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,986
If he excepts me
then

392
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,717
That man

393
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,593
Who I want to live with

394
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,728
His name is

395
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:39,199
Hazoor Jan M.Khan

396
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:47,466
Why you didn't give me the
ending phrase.

397
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,210
You just give me the phrase.

398
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,180
I am asking to you,7

399
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,116
It was not done,

400
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:00,020
Did I born it?

401
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:05,220
Look! Noor Muhammed Behelvi!
ltalvi!

402
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:11,392
ltalvi? Where is that?
In Italy!

403
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,737
My mom is Italian

404
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:29,412
So Noor Muhammed ltalvi,
It's like...

405
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,718
I need 20 new poetry till evening,

406
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:36,016
20 poetry till evening?
and they all must be...

407
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,228
great to hear.

408
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,391
Otherwise I will blow your head.

409
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:46,564
Somebody tell him that how would
I prepare 20 poetry till evening,

410
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,198
I am not a computer.

411
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,666
Give me some ice,

412
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,106
First words...

413
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,544
then ice,

414
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,452
It's a nice phrase.

415
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,649
Be carefull!

416
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,619
Show some mercy,

417
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:51,761
I present my poetry to Bugum Para

418
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:59,899
When I saw him with special look

419
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,779
Then she saw the mirror from new style

420
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:14,916
After lighting the lamp

421
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,380
Women forces are gone

422
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:22,451
Only Sikandar was sitting upset there

423
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:26,351
What has happend to you

424
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:31,549
My dear guests!

425
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:36,391
I don't have those sweet words

426
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,534
nor that way of style

427
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:44,503
with whom all these great poets have
introduced you before me

428
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,773
If I have something

429
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:52,007
that's only naked beating heart

430
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:56,648
whose voice.

431
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:05,821
I would like to present to Begum Para

432
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,128
if you allow me,

433
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:14,934
Are you ok?

434
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:23,373
You are looking very buetiful
Thank you

435
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,580
Please calm down

436
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:10,882
Hold on a minute

437
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:17,925
Dont come near me
Please listen to me first

438
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:19,026
What are you doing?

439
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:30,031
Please don't shoot

440
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:32,533
Dont act smart

441
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:34,571
No one move

442
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,710
You can go

443
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:37,437
But

444
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,509
Don't harm Begum

445
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:44,246
Sir please

446
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:47,649
Don't get angry

447
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,655
If you need anything let me know

448
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:16,683
where did he come from?

449
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:16,743
He is starting the car

450
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:19,249
I won't spare you

451
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,486
I have done everything for you.

452
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,574
Greetings!
Greetings!

453
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:45,372
Are you tired?

454
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,515
Will you take my life,

455
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:51,778
Would you like to run more?
If I will run more

456
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:54,421
then my heart will break down

457
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:56,085
Do you have heart?

458
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,729
I will die,

459
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:01,920
Show some mercy,

460
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:04,796
Did you show mercy on me?

461
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:07,027
You left me alone to die,
I didn't left you

462
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,597
I was protecting myself,

463
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:13,802
What?

464
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,547
Where is the necklace?

465
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,251
You hit me very hard

466
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:29,183
Get off the car

467
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:28,914
<i>Are you hart'?</i>

468
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:31,990
I missed the necklace that day

469
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:32,656
Get out

470
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:35,395
when we escaped.
Do you remember?

471
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:39,628
Remove your mask
Promise me you won't shoot

472
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:37,932
When they were shooting on us,

473
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,257
I was felt down in water,

474
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:41,068
So I left the necklace there

475
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,070
I thought you would have seen that

476
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:47,074
You have roan the whole plan

477
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:44,973
I didn't see anything

478
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:46,268
that's your problem

479
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:48,240
you never pay attention on work

480
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:50,244
You swine

481
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:51,646
I thought you would have seen that
so I ran away

482
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:54,342
I never expected you to be a
betrayer

483
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:56,309
so why you didn't came to graveyard
when Mushtaq called us

484
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,779
Did I not tell you?

485
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:57,912
Why would I came there?

486
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,420
Why would I came to get my
penis cut,

487
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,983
Begum should not be harmed

488
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,125
ls your penis fine?

489
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,895
You are making fun of me?

490
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,827
I'll kill you if you do

491
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:07,894
I will call Mushtaq.

492
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,089
I will call his number

493
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,563
and you will forget your attitude,

494
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,827
Who made you kidnap her

495
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:11,796
No!

496
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,104
You won't call Mushtaq

497
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:16,737
I did

498
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:18,464
But why?
Because my lusty friend

499
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,133
look over there,

500
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:34,417
She is pretty.

501
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:38,690
I just got the news

502
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:42,321
I was gone to the movies
with my wife

503
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,360
Son of a bitch
find out how is it

504
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:46,802
You!
Yes!

505
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:50,333
Is everything alright?
Absolutely!

506
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:50,567
Find out

507
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,733
Your nose is bleeding,

508
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,439
Who has dared to do all this

509
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:56,641
I think,

510
00:33:57,568 --> 00:33:59,878
I was just running

511
00:33:59,370 --> 00:33:59,745
Jan Sir

512
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:00,906
for what?

513
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:06,519
Yes speak
The new S.P has arrived

514
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,717
They all praised me a lot

515
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:07,680
so I couldn't tolerate and I ran back

516
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:11,756
And by the way you are treating
me very well

517
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:15,054
I think I've got some problem

518
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,123
When have you been
posted here?

519
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,061
We will arrest them

520
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:21,125
Come to my mansion!

521
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:22,260
I will give some bandage

522
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:24,070
There is no need of it

523
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:28,273
You are new what can I say

524
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:26,374
It's just bleeding,
He will be fine

525
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:29,970
Who are you?

526
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,469
You would do nothing on your own

527
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:32,212
He is my servant

528
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:34,482
You will inform me

529
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:33,382
Name!

530
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,480
Tell her your name,

531
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,382
I would do all the actions

532
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:37,610
Babban!

533
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:45,528
Servant quarters are behind
the mansion

534
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,730
You can join us after dinner

535
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,494
If you also live there

536
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:58,002
then I will be settle down

537
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:02,470
Are you alirght?

538
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:04,871
Your I bitch

539
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,972
Thanks!

540
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,344
Everyone has his face hidden

541
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:10,147
Show me your palm!

542
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:12,517
This Begum of your's

543
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:14,281
She also has one on her

544
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:15,122
Not left but right palm,

545
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:20,185
Finding a new husband is all a act

546
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:20,989
What?

547
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:23,097
She just wants money

548
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,528
What did you see?

549
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:24,794
That you don't have

550
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:26,193
Come!

551
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,197
How did she know?

552
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,161
This line goes to heart

553
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:30,798
it's toren from many places

554
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:32,904
I told her
Sorry

555
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:33,633
I think you've got many problems
in your affairs,

556
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:34,266
Now

557
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:38,103
As soon as I got to know
there plan

558
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:36,904
Are you a palmist?

559
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:38,604
It's my hobby!

560
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:41,743
Munni and Begam are partners

561
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:40,573
But she is better than professionals

562
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,353
Like me and you
I am not your partner

563
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,646
She always predict the truth

564
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:46,648
Really!

565
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,522
Why are you acting childish

566
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:48,717
Don't listen to her

567
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:50,319
<i>She is a â€œat,</i>

568
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,120
List to the plan first

569
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:51,756
<i>Liar'.!</i>

570
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:54,892
They plan to choose a rich husband

571
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,190
Tell me something else about me,

572
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:56,730
And then would get kidnapped

573
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,161
As soon as they get the rendsom money

574
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:00,997
They will escape

575
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:03,563
You are going to step in the greatest
moment of your life,

576
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,206
I said if they select you
they won't get a single peny

577
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:06,907
All of your problems...

578
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,539
will be solved,

579
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,405
I had to say the truth

580
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,647
There is one thing

581
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:17,083
You are hiding an expensive thing

582
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:16,244
This Begum of yours

583
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,714
ls beautiful

584
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:22,823
As soon as she found
out you were broke

585
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:25,520
Take our picture from your phone

586
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,018
<i>Said "Oh God"</i>

587
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:26,884
Now ill have to choose Jan Mohammad

588
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,024
My phone battery is dead,

589
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:30,463
Khalu got his heart broken

590
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:29,624
My phone is charged,

591
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:30,858
May I take it?

592
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:30,959
What?

593
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:34,369
Did she say khalu
No

594
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,798
She said "lftekhar" with love

595
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:41,909
iPhone 2!

596
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,243
If you could meet me

597
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,647
after evening...

598
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,288
Night comes after evening

599
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,515
Mr Kidnapper

600
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,887
Whatever your demands are

601
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:57,850
Yes! I mean...

602
00:36:58,015 --> 00:36:59,289
And in these nights

603
00:36:58,583 --> 00:36:59,891
lam willing to agree to them

604
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,129
I am looking for Yaad Al Joza.

605
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,128
I request you to

606
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:03,521

607
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,059
Not harm my to be wife

608
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:06,031
It's the star closer to moon

609
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:08,665
It shines like a ball

610
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:11,295
When lphone 5 is availabe in market

611
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,466
then nobody will take lPhone 2.

612
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,365
I beg of you

613
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:15,870

614
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:22,882
LPhone 5 is much better,

00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:23,909
Take it!

616
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,713
<i>8</i> mega pixel camera.

617
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,212
I was missing you

618
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:28,851
Come closer.

I am ok
Give the phone to him

620
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:44,430
If I will see Yad Al Joza tomorrow night

621
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,498
Jan brother

622
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,442
then you also come

623
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:56,311
The many fingers your wife carries

624
00:37:56,974 --> 00:38:00,421
I need that much in
rendsome (100 million)

625
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,780
Where did you steal this car?

626
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:01,746
I have bought it.

627
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:01,414
Ok

628
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:04,720
Where do I have to deliver

629
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,393
Really?
Why?

630
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:08,891
Because I am not a thief anymore.

631
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,794
I'll let you know
Ok

632
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,065
Really!

633
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:13,293
You are not a thief.

634
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:14,395
Then who you are?

635
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,404
I am the Khalu of thief,

636
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:20,242
Ask for the address from the exchange

637
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:26,746
Take others with you

638
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:32,220
Nothing would happen

639
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:37,783
Tell the bank manager to
arrange 100 million

640
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,427
Sorry Nawab Saheb!

641
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:50,432
What is this?

642
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,937
You are bleeding,

643
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:00,972
I am sorry but your car was
out of control

644
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,347
What you have done with my car,

645
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,617
Not worse than my heart.

646
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:10,487
In last few days your heart has
ruined me a lot

647
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:12,886
but you didn't said sorry

648
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:15,996
who will pay the money?

649
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,189
For what?

650
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:18,364
For fixing,

651
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,399
Fixing is not done yet.

652
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,766
Guess what do I have

653
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,373
Let me tell you one thing

654
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:34,714
You have got nice lover style.

655
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:37,744
You are going to flert with Begum

656
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:42,619
She is mine.

657
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,196
Mummy and daddy

658
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:50,128
Together

659
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:52,693
Free from all

660
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:55,733
You have gone mad
When should I book the tickets

661
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:56,996
Direct to dehli in 6 hours.

662
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:58,639
Look

663
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:00,406
These are two tickets of AC,

664
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,370
This is not possible
No that can't be

665
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:03,971
What?

666
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:05,573
Train will leave at 7 in morning

667
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:08,373
We are on the sixth stage
Meaning?

668
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,314
Good bye!

669
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,418
Let's go!

670
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:12,812
Love has seven stages

671
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:18,356
But tickets are not confirmed

672
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:22,355
So!

673
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,032
And I don't wait for my dad either.

674
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,399
There is no problem,

675
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:34,607
There is no problem with
these tickets.

676
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,573
Full seats are confirmation
before list.

677
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:45,012
Come we need to talk
Not now

678
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:44,809
Your seats will be confirmed,
that's my promise.

679
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:58,255
What are you doing Bubban
leave me

680
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,633
Listen to me

681
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:04,430

682
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:07,842

683
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:08,469
What happen?

684
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,309
True love I sware

685
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,742
Not promise but a problem,

686
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,414
It means wine.

687
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:16,475
You are mad

688
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,252
You guys

689
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:22,685
Will you take this problem with
soda or water.

690
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:23,021
Dont know the difference
between love and sex

691
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,095
At least give us one peg.

692
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:31,093
Meaning a one night stand

693
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:34,960
Would great you with many chances

694
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:38,963
When you are carrying a gun,

695
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:40,935
then you shouldn't read the poetry,

696
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,375
but you should kill the lion.

697
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:46,242
If you will shoot then you
will also die,

698
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:44,639
Listen brother

699
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,208
Its my mistake
forgive me

700
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,445
One of us will shoot must somebody
will die

701
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:50,980
If Khalu will shoot you will
must die,

702
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,783
That I had sex with you

703
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,218
If I will shoot you

704
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:55,622
But don't talk about love again

705
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:53,684
then you will think

706
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,455
that I would rather die.

707
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:56,817
Nobody will shoot.

708
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:57,892
Do me a favour

709
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:58,324
Ask your guys,

710
00:41:58,482 --> 00:41:59,722
and leave me alone

711
00:41:58,749 --> 00:41:59,591
Put the guns dows.

712
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:01,585
You put your weapon down.
No!

713
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:02,893
You first!

714
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,498
What are you doing?

715
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:04,790
It's not possible,
then fine

716
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:07,892
You played games with me

717
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,499
You all keep standing,
I am already sitted here

718
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:11,895
Listen you will get your share

719
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:28,755
You think I did it all for money
I did it for you

720
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,658
I don't want the money now
I want to kill you

721
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:34,619
I'll let everyone know the truth
about you

722
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,794
These divas are actually witches

723
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:46,039
I want to pee.

724
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:47,975
Keep standing,

725
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,238
No!

726
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:52,578
I can't wait!

727
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,280
I will pee here

728
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:56,476
Put your gun down and go,

729
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:16,494
Now we are on the seventh stage

730
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:19,565
Whats that?

731
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,633
Death

732
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:11,583
Saleem Tea shop is here?

733
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:13,918
After getting it all you will
leave me

734
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:13,760
Your name?
Anarkali.

735
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:17,096
You are not keeping your word

736
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:20,227
This stage must be closer to main gate,

737
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:27,674
It's not easy to kidnap someone
from this gathering.

738
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:27,865
This call was made in a market

739
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:32,713
They are smart

740
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,836
We will have to move our target
as soon as possible

741
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:35,473
Once this main door will be closed

742
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:38,017
My mother and Sonia were batch mates

743
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,177
then no police can follow us,

744
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:43,821
And if my mother gets to know of all
this you would be doomed

745
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:43,553
Police behind the doors.

746
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,087
We will divert them before they
enter.

747
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:52,596
Where will we hide?
Did you bring the advance?

748
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:53,095
One more word and I will
blow your brains out

749
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:57,329
Ok do it

750
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:58,733
In few days...

751
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,640
We didn't came for interview.

752
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:11,315
This is the last time I am saying so

753
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:15,185
Today was bank holiday

754
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:20,495
When banks will open...

755
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:34,569
Bring tea for the S.P

756
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:35,171
Target picture.

757
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:40,708
You

758
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:42,842
Your still in jail

759
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,710
Today I got a bail from court

760
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:49,822
Paid them bribe

761
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:04,568

00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:10,574
Deposit the cash back

764
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:17,214
I told you you would not take any
action

765
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:16,641
You need a baby girl.

766
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:19,482
You will must get this time.

767
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:20,680
Listen

768
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:22,285
You leave the hand

769
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,383
First make your husband understand
that forget about the land,

770
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,056
Can't you understand what im saying?

771
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:27,521
You will lose your court case.

772
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,227
I tried to make her understand but
she never listen to me

773
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:57,854
What is this?

774
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,458
A present for you

775
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,329
Have a look!

776
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,163
I can't take it

777
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:09,098
Such an expensive gift.

778
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:12,941
In a few hours

779
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:16,077
then I will ask you something
in return

780
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:15,207
The money would be here

781
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:17,609
Then you will be free to go

782
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:17,736
What?

783
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,313
With your share

784
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:20,909
Someday allow me to visit
your rehearsals.

785
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,911
It's been a long time to see
you dancing

786
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:26,781
I am sorrow

787
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:29,117
That I got you involved in all this

788
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:34,655
I am the fan of your dance

789
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,962
If you love me truly

790
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:39,431
Then please eat

791
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,895
Whom you want to give this
expensive gift

792
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,506
That Para is died long time ago.

793
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:52,675
I am not in the position to love

794
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:55,514
I can be a well wisher

795
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,920
A friend a helper

796
00:47:59,977 --> 00:48:01,820
But cant be a lover

797
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:04,621
But you can be a cheat

798
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:13,965
I wish I could explain

799
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:20,103
If you want to you can

800
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:23,308
I'll try to understand

801
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:26,774
You sure
Yes

802
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,380
My husband

803
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:37,083
Was gay

804
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:43,625
His all day activity was Gambling
and drinking

805
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:47,524
I tried

806
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,101
To get separated

807
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,970
No one helped me for that

808
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:56,166
Not my family or anyone else

809
00:48:57,801 --> 00:48:59,405
I got sick

810
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:05,152
No medication could heal me

811
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,486
lam thankfull to her

812
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:09,220
lphone 5.

813
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,185
Which one you want?

814
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:12,622
Chinese or American,

815
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:13,354
She is my friend

816
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:14,856
All lines are busy at this moment,

817
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,161
My sister

818
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:17,087
But I am on call waiting

819
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:17,061
And my life

820
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:20,335
This facility is not available
on your number

821
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:20,293
Then one day

822
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:21,659
Nawab sahab passed away

823
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,001
Press star to copy this song

824
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:23,728
And I was free

825
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,196
then press 9.

826
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:28,066
But by being broke

827
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:32,277
He had every thing morgaged

828
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:33,779
At the bank

829
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:40,110
He used to spend loan money his all
life then died one day

830
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:42,289
After his death

831
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:45,026
Jan Mohammad came to rescue me

832
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:45,458
What are your intentions?

833
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:47,392
But with the deal to merry me

834
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,255
Not good

835
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:50,961
He had one wish

836
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,597
To become Mehmoodabads Nawab

837
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:52,059
Will you come with me?

838
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,166
For romantic dinner?

839
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:55,629
What will you buy me?

840
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:57,899
What you like most?

841
00:49:57,594 --> 00:49:59,767
Life was hash

842
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:01,365
And what do I like?

843
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:03,644
I wanted to be as hasher with life

844
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:05,840
Chinese!

845
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:08,779
Then

846
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:09,547
I know...

847
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:13,886
Now what do you plan
with all this money

848
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:11,643
girls are afraid from lizards.

849
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:13,046
And die on noodles.

850
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:15,750
I am absolutely right,

851
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:17,889
I will go where my fast
would not haunt me

852
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:19,552
Far

853
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,228
When I will eat noodles.

854
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:24,963
Should I send you to heaven

855
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:24,094
then only in Shanghai.

856
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:27,758
Burger in NewYork

857
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:49,948
Nobody knows when time will changed

858
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:53,618
What is it?
Call

859
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,889
If time would be changed but
desires won't be changed

860
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,450
It's him

861
00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:59,922
My desires from my heart.

862
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:01,024
Have you arranged the amount

863
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:01,760
Always remember!

864
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:01,692
Yes

865
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:03,562
where should I bring the money

866
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,225
If I want to forget but you won't
let me

867
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:07,164
At the book store of the
railway station

868
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:11,236
I can see your old accounts in
mansion's walls

869
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:08,126
12 o'clock

870
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,032
Ok

871
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,034
I am speaking from the bell tower

872
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:15,302
Don't waste time by sending
your man after me

873
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:16,805
I have told you many times

874
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,239
Be on time

875
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:22,450
from last 2 years I am coming
to your mansion

876
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,817
Reason is your money...

877
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:27,714
No!

878
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:31,223
Dont move stay there

879
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,655

881
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:36,423
Bubbun listen

882
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:40,534
My Allah knows that I am not
interested in money

883
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,697
Jan Mohammad knows about our plan

884
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:44,264
What?

885
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,864
But I want my breathes back

886
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:47,398
Now we are not going to get the money

887
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:49,401
He will kill me then

888
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:53,077
We should run from here

889
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,440
What do you say

890
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:57,244
Please believe me

891
00:52:57,374 --> 00:52:58,910
I am telling you the truth

892
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:05,821
My name is Jaan

893
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:09,158
I can give my life for you

894
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,362
So I can take someone's life.

895
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:22,522
I said I don't want it

896
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:41,107
You get off the next station

897
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,588
Who allowed you to come here?

898
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:54,824
My heart!

899
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:01,631

00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:10,442
Come back!

903
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:15,174
Look! You have some misunderstanding

904
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:17,348
You are being injustice with
yourself.

905
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,861
I Cargo train will be here

906
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:34,362
Get on it to escape

00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:37,129
Where is Begum Para Jaan

908
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:36,160
Remember!

909
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:38,899

910
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:44,108
Come!

911
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,439

914
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:53,321
Then I will show you how stubborn I am

915
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:53,210

00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:55,385
I am not gonna move without knowing
the reason

917
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:56,920
9211

918
00:56:57,046 --> 00:56:59,117
Why did you kill that Para?

919
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:02,358
Her every breathe was dance

920
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:04,056
Please come Nawab sahab

921
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,657
Where is that Para whom...

922
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:07,332
I have seen 25 years back

923
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:13,303
In Town hall Auditorium

924
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,041
Your Master Birju Maharaj was
also there

925
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:19,071
That day...

926
00:57:21,037 --> 00:57:23,415
you forgot yourself while
you were dancing

927
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,947
Is it the told amount

928
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:29,154
Where that Para has gone?

929
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:42,062
We are the culprits let them go

930
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:45,268
They are innocent

931
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:49,403
Ok if you say so

932
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:52,269

933
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:55,439
Bring them here

934
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:00,783
Lets go

935
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,398
Begum wants me to let you go

936
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:14,893
You are innocent

937
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:21,633
You only find me evil

938
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,904
Rest of all are innocent like them

939
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:34,754
I had everything dedicated to you

940
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:43,795
And you were mad about his stolen
Poetry

941
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:46,431
My poetry was orignal

942
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,396

984
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,718
You have lost your behaviour.

985
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,653
Look upstairs!

986
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:12,260

01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:22,540
I will shove your Nawab in your ass.

991
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,210
Why did you lie to me?

992
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:25,778
I didn't lie to you

993
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:27,804
I just didn't tell you the truth

994
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:29,777
Look! don't make me confuse.

995
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:31,884
You said that you felt in that
pipe line

996
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,782
and you left that necklace in
pipe line

997
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:35,890
I have told you the truth I felt
down in pipe line

998
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:37,352
and I also dropped the necklace.

999
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:41,355
Then I got up and picked up
the necklace

1000
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:43,829

01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,798
Don't mess with me and throw
down the ladder.

1005
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:53,736
I am enjoying the air here

1006
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:55,637
Come upstairs,

1007
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:57,601
Why did you cut the phone?

1008
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:02,946
I will keep standing here
all night long.

1009
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:39,881
Look!

1010
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:42,548
Listen to me!

1011
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:43,950
Look at my dignity,

1012
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,391
If I want I would kill you there

1013
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:47,855
But I love you

1014
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:52,056
What son?

1015
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:54,501
You left me alone to die

1016
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:56,630
lam gonna get my penis cut.

1017
01:04:56,759 --> 01:04:58,534
Mushtaq was holding knife on me,

1018
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:01,033
You left me alone.

1019
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:03,042
Listen to me,

1020
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:02,058
It's been half an hour

1021
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:04,101
Hakeem didn't die.

1022
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:14,642
Your disease belongs to your heart

1023
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:17,845
You are sad.

1024
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:21,113
Your childhood wound

1025
01:06:22,578 --> 01:06:24,251
some old regrets.

1026
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:27,490
Be happy!

1027
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:29,260
That's your cure.

1028
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:31,963
You are the patient of love

1029
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:35,135
Find a lover.

1030
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:38,729
Then your shivering will be gone.

1031
01:06:43,799 --> 01:06:47,076
I always lived for others.

1032
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,381
Then your aunt!

1033
01:06:53,976 --> 01:06:55,114
Mushtaq!

1034
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:57,951
Then sister and you,

1035
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:00,825
I never got chance to think
about myself.

1036
01:07:02,718 --> 01:07:04,823
So I decided,

1037
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:09,996
that I should live for myself before
I die.

1038
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:15,240
If I wouldn't keep myself happy then
how would I keep others.

1039
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:22,046
Then what about about our penis?

1040
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:24,384
I gave that necklace in gift.

1041
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:28,887
Freedom is the best gift of life

1042
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:31,056
Now we will steal that necklace

1043
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:33,223
Which is priceless

1044
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:38,559
We got freedom
You had to pay for it

1045
01:07:38,154 --> 01:07:42,899
She have lot of gold in her safe

1046
01:07:39,955 --> 01:07:42,526
I thought lovers like you

1047
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:44,863
are only fictionised

1048
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:47,170
You want to steal in your own house.

1049
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:50,067
I wish of your desparation in love

1050
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:48,765
Not my house,

1051
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:52,407
My upcoming in laws house

1052
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:51,870
Love

1053
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:56,310
I was not deserving of your love

1054
01:07:57,406 --> 01:07:59,716
Now I will spend my life
with my wife.

1055
01:07:58,107 --> 01:08:01,850
You would find someone better then me
But if you not lucky we will meet again

1056
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:17,197
I had my own world

1057
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:26,712
My world was calm now

1058
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:31,015
Do visit my world one day

1059
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:39,783
There is a good news
You have been granted bail

1060
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:41,494
Who has done it?

1061
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:44,262
It's your wife
Get lost

1062
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:47,260
I told you they loved us

1063
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:26,868
Any last wishes?

1064
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:33,475
We wanted to sing a song
