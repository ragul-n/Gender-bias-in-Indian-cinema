1
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,140
Children' what are you doing?

2
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,910
Grandpa' this is my palace."

3
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:56,816
I am the king of this palace.

4
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:00,149
Radha is the queen of this palace.

5
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,630
All right. That is fine.

6
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,826
And where am I in your palace?

7
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,092
You too are here.
You are the minister.

8
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:16,098
"I'm the minister' you're
the king and Radha' the queen."

9
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,442
"Your Royal Highnesses'
please come for dinner."

10
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:25,608
"No' let Mummy return from the
hospital. Then we'll eat together."

11
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,850
Mummy is home!

12
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:31,788
Later' kids..."

13
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,116
Father...

14
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,793
What's the matter?
Need something again?

15
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,563
Father' my husband is serious."

16
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:41,532
The doctor says if he isn't
operated upon immediately..

17
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,131
he won't survive.

18
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,129
What is the point in that
drunk gambler's living?

19
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,870
Save him for now.

20
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,811
Then I'll never ask you for help.

21
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,704
I've helped you so many times.

22
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,749
"Anyway' all that you see
does not belong to me."

23
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,918
It's kept with me in
trust by my late friend.

24
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:06,155
It's the right of these children.

25
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:08,685
I can't help you.

26
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:11,086
- What are you saying?
- That's right.

27
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:17,502
"Even if I could' I wouldn't
spare a penny for that drunk!"

28
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,095
Your heart has turned to stone.

29
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:24,702
"Yes' my dear. Seeing you in this
state has made me stone hearted."

30
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:28,512
All right. Then keep your wealth.

31
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,510
Henceforth we share no relation.

32
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,716
Radha' get up."

33
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,111
"- Prashant' let's go.
- Lakshmi..."

34
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,115
The kids...

35
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,140
- Yes.
- Dev Narain here.

36
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:08,084
My son-in-law Shekhar
is admitted in your hospital.

37
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,691
Please begin the operation.
I'll be there with the cash.

38
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,855
He passed away a while ago.

39
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,752
""l belong to you"""

40
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,845
Come here.

41
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,924
Are you hungry?

42
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,790
Yes.

43
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,403
Son' you didn't tell us your name."

44
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,072
I don't have a name.

45
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,075
Don't you have parents?

46
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,077
I have nobody.

47
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:19,074
No' dear. Don't say that."

48
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,918
Henceforth you're not alone.
All of us are with you.

49
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,085
I'll call you Suraj.

50
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,082
Would you like that?

51
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,756
My name... Suraj?

52
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:35,499
"Yes' dear. Now on
you'll live with us."

53
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:07,065

55
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,869
You sing so well.

56
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:16,735
Your voice is so sweet.

57
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:20,568
Really? But everyone says
I'm stupid and can't sing.

58
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:26,477
They are mad. You'll see
someday you'll be world famous!

59
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,082
Radha is right.

60
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,088
Someday you'll be a famous singer.

61
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,581
But you'll have to work hard.

62
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,560
"- Will you?
- Yes' I will."

"For the first time' he's got
a chance to sing on stage."

67
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,160
Bless him.

68
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,158
Help him spread joy
through his voice.

69
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,160
Let fame kiss his feet.

70
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,162
His honour is in your hands.

Sister...!

Mother is hopping mad.
Don't tell her where I am.

103
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,071
- Prashant! Where is he?
- Run off.

104
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,074
Earlier he'd vanish from the house.

105
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:16,077
These days he also
makes money disappear.

106
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,080
"Mother' why are you screaming
so early in the morning?"

107
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:21,086
He stole his own money
not from the neighbours.

108
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,758
Tell me' where he is."

109
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,587
Must have gone to
see an Amitabh film.

110
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,096
He hasn't gone to see any
film. He's right here!

111
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:33,594
No' mother. I swear by you...on me.."

112
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,597
You're taking a false
promise for that rascal!

No' mother. I.."

114
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,109
Wait. I know how to get him out.

115
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,105
- Mother! - What?
- Nothing.

116
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,516
She's also losing her head.

117
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:03,966
Mother! I don't mind if you
throw me out of the house!

118
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,400
But you did wrong by
throwing Mr. Amit out!

119
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,062
- I did.
- Yes.

120
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,068
Just you wait.
I'll show you what's right!

121
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,566
- I won's spare you!
- Mother!

122
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,739
You stay out of this!

123
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,473
You've spoilt him by
always supporting him!

124
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,745
He will regret this
once you get married!

125
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,578
That won't happen because I'll
take him along when I get married.

126
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,558
Who wants to live with you?
Both of us will stay with sis.

127
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,091
Wants to stay with his sister!

128
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:32,591
You'll know when your
husband beats both of you.

129
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,566
"lf he beats me up'
I too will hammer him."

130
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,591
But I won't leave my brother.

131
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,570
I'll keep him close to my heart.

132
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,096
Can't argue with you guys.

133
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,102
You can never change!

134
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,442
Mom...I love you very much.

135
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,705
Do you know why?

136
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,849
Because you gave birth to my sister.

137
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,109
- lsn't that right?
- You're craZy.

138
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:03,123
I have to remove the spell
from Suraj. You made me forget.

139
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,058
Let's go.

140
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,534
What are you doing?

141
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,664
- What are you doing?
- Protecting you from evil.

142
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,563
Do it well.

143
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,072
Protect me too.

144
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,077
Who will cast a spell on you
that I must protect you from?

145
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:23,813
Help yourself.

146
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,576
Phone again?

147
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,818
A star is bound to get calls.

148
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,684
On the phone all the time!

149
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,558
Fan calls. On the phone all day.

150
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,890
Have breakfast. It's turning cold.

151
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,898
- How is the bread?
- Beautiful.

152
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,570
- And the vegetable?
- Terrific.

153
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,697
Has to be good. I made it.

154
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:51,440
Your fan following and
singing is thanks to me.

155
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,703
You can't sing without my food.

156
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,109
"- What's the matter?
- Sir' what's wrong?"

157
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,913
- What?
- Too spicy!

158
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,450
What? You were just
praising my cooking.

159
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,118
NO. I was praising my fan.

160
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:05,787
Who was praising me.
Do you mind?

161
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,123
I can't cook any better.

162
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,460
"lf you want good food'

163
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,123
"Yes' I'm looking out
for a beautiful girl."

164
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,125
Why don't you marry him?

165
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,604
"l said' I'm looking for
a beautiful girl. Beautiful!"

166
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,972
Okay. As if I am
interested in you!

167
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,136
My husband will have a
big moustache! Like this.

168
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,909
Yes' he will have huge moustache."

169
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:30,880
And he will stammer.

170
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,641
He'll stammer out your name.

171
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,643
Look at him...

172
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,148
No' there's no Suraj here."

173
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,490
- Ask the name..
- He's busy..

174
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,652
What's your name?

175
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,826
- He's busy.
- Give me the phone.

176
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,938
Why don't you speak?

177
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,767
I've cut her off.

178
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:03,171
Do you know I already feel
sorry for your future husband.

179
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,631
Sir?

180
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,137
- This..
- For me?

181
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,140
It's not for you.
What is it?

182
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,882
I know that it's a letter.
But what is this?

183
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,148
You sent my letter back to me!

184
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,151
Now on' all the letters that come.."

185
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:52,962
And the sale deeds and tins of
Amul Spray...send them to my house.

186
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,895
I'll drink it mixed in milk at
night and you sing me a lullaby!

187
00:18:58,504 --> 00:18:59,937
Sir' you said lullaby.."

188
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,905
Where is your head?

189
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,611
What do you keep thinking?

190
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,782
- Yes sir?
- Take this and leave.

191
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,126
It's very hot inside.

192
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,930
The air conditioner in
this office doesn't work.

193
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,131
You feel terribly hot.

194
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:36,130
Why do you display your body?

195
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,476
I've started wearing long
skirts after that day..

196
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:40,805
I meant the top not the bottom.

197
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:44,138
I'll have to make you a uniform.

198
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,142
Something with buttons
all the way to the top.

199
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,157
"- Brother' it's me Neeta.
- Yes?"

200
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,170
"All of a sudden' uncle
took a turn for the worse."

201
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,433
He keeps asking for Lakshmi Aunty.

202
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,604
I've sent a message for her.

203
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,111
She must be on her way.

204
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,451
Will father get well?
Will he be all right?

205
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,121
"Don't worry' mother
He'll be all right."

206
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,618
Mother...

207
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:01,990
"- God' what have you done?
- No' father.."

208
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:06,153
After so many years my
daughter is coming to see me!

209
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,691
And you snatched her away!

210
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,591
You should have taken me away.

211
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,783
I am coming.

212
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,459
We can't record today.

213
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,121
"No' not even tomorrow.
Or the day after."

214
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,124
I don't know when

215
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,127
And I can't comment
on when we can record.

216
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,129
Please hang up.
Or I'll hang up.

217
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,134
Want to record..
Nobody understands.

218
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:53,875
At least eat something.

219
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,615
How can I eat?

220
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,618
Radha hasn't eaten for 3 days.

221
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,151
You don't know...

222
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:09,584
"When I was little' I'd wander
around without food or water."

223
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,490
Radha herself would feed me.

224
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,093
She supported me.

225
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:16,765
Today she has no support.

226
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:23,097
"Sir' I know at such a time
one shouldn't' say this."

227
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,440
What?

228
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,100
Why don't you marry her?

229
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,774
I never gave it thought.

230
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,777
I've had dreams for her.

231
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,111
"A handsome husband'
a famous family."

232
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:42,520
My Radha finds happiness
wherever she goes.

233
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:45,892
That's a nice dream but
where will you find this husband?

234
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:49,794
We'll find him.
He will be found.

235
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:59,542
Uncle Ramu!

236
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,140
See...who has come.

237
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,084
why are you standing out? Come in.

238
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,081
Now all this is yours.

239
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:11,817
Both of you will stay here with me.

240
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:17,755
- Prashant and Radha..
- Good day.

241
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:20,087
- How are you? - Fine.
- And how are you?

242
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:24,091
Chat later. First get their bags.

243
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,095
In a flash.

244
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:33,100
Sis...I've only seen such big
houses in Amitabh's films.

245
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,877
"Grandpa' may I go
upstairs to see the house?"

246
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:41,116
Why just upstairs?
See the whole house.

247
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:42,784
It's all yours.

248
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:48,115
Today I have a house' car..."

249
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,125
What do you..?

250
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:54,598
It's my fault.

251
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,131
I was reciting Amit's
dialogues so we crashed.

252
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:19,079
"Watching you play' I feel
your youth has returned."

253
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:23,085
"Not just my youth'
my joys have returned."

254
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:24,860
I don't follow.

255
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:27,860
I promised my friend...

256
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:31,095
I mean Gopal's father

257
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:36,100
He left both his children with me.

258
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:40,509
I'd promised my friend
that I'd raise them.

259
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:42,841
I've kept my word.

260
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,777
Gopal and Neeta can
now look after themselves.

261
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:50,849
Now I will look after the
children of my daughter.

262
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:54,114
The love that they were
deprived of as children..

263
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:55,857
I'll give them that love.

264
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:58,789
Only one job remains...

265
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,556
Of taking his medication.

266
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:02,531
That you must not have done.

267
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:06,126
You've been so unwell and
now you're playing like a kid!

268
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:08,063
Even you didn't stop him.
In fact you joined him!

269
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,071
Leave the game and go
take your medicines.

270
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,567
The pills and medication..no more.

271
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:17,073
- What do you mean?
- I'm absolutely fit. Happy

272
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,074
I'm getting you married.

273
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:22,079
You want me to get married
because you are happy.

274
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:24,819
- I don't want to get married.
- Why not?

275
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,887
I've even found you a bride!

276
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:29,083
"You should have asked me'
without asking me..."

277
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:32,089
- Why do I need to ask you?
- Who is getting married? You or me?

278
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:34,089
- I don't want to marry..
- Why?

279
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:36,764
There's a girl in my heart
since I was a kid.

280
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:38,763
I will only marry her

281
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:42,098
"Actually as a kid' there's
been a girl in my heart too."

282
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,769
So I'll marry you off to her.

283
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,943
If you like her since childhood
she's as old as you so you marry her.

284
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:51,105
No. I know her since she was a kid.

285
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,774
- Why are you arguing?
- I'm not arguing. I won't marry!

286
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,780
- You are arguing.
- There's no argument.

287
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:57,952
"- You are small' obey me..
- I don't want to marry!"

288
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,715
- Uncle tell him...
- Grandpa..

289
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,786
- Why are you telling him?
- Grandpa...

290
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:06,123
Let him marry the girl in his heart.

291
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,555
You don't interfere...

292
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,466
- Don't force him..
- When did you come?

293
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,468
A while ago.

294
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:18,065
Forget the small talk. The girl l
chose for you is none other than her.

295
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,745
I said..the girl in my heart...

296
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,577
"Keep quiet. I said'
you are marrying Radha."

297
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,080
Yes but the girl I mentioned..

298
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,082
Don't butt in.

299
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,854
I was telling him I like a girl..

300
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,089
- Why are you asking her?
- All right.

301
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,867
"Once you get married'
I'll go on a pilgrimage."

302
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,100
As you wish.

303
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,880
Coming' grandpa!"

304
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,519
Let go..

305
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,854
Do you know who is
the girl in my heart?

306
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,790
- I don't know.
- How come?

307
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,894
- You should know.
- I don't.

308
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,967
Uncle didn't give me
any time to speak..

309
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,800
- You should know.
- I don't.

310
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:25,133
And I don't even want
to know about that chump.

311
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,807
You should know about the chimp.

312
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,877
- Why?
- What does that mean?

313
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,475
Have you forgotten everything?
When we were kids..

314
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,644
Under the umbrella..
when it was pouring..

315
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,817
- Can't recall?
- No.

316
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,653
And that little house..
the king and queen game..

317
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:44,156
Don't you remember anything?

318
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,155
"What are you muttering?
Game of king' under the umbrella.."

319
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,157
All right. Where is she?

320
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,832
- Here.
- That even I know.

321
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,162
But how can I peer into your heart?

322
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:56,904
You can peep into my bedroom.

323
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,575
Is she in the bedroom?

324
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,976
There's a dressing table
behind my bed. Near it.

325
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,172
- Go and take a look.
- No.

326
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,883
- Grandpa sent me for a job..
- Send grandpa to blaZes!

327
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,450
He created all the confusion.

328
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,112
- Go and take a look.
- I don't want to go.

329
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:14,888
Our marriage..
We're getting married.

330
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:16,787
I want you to know everything.

331
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,790
I don't want to see her..

332
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,599
You're forcing me!

333
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,133
Chimp!

334
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,903
Go and take a look!

335
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:30,805
Reached the bedroom!

336
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,133
Peep into my heart.

337
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,140
Is she pretty?

338
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:37,145
Must be a chump.

339
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:39,480
Could she be in the bathroom?

340
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:41,816
Anybody in?

341
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:45,554
Seen?

342
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:48,148
Where? There's nobody here.
Not even a photograph.

343
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,718
I never said there's a photo.

344
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:52,891
I said near the dressing table.

345
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:55,758
See for yourself
There's nothing but a brush.

346
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,162
Not the brush.

347
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:58,833
Come here.

348
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:03,663
Look at this.

349
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:05,506
Where?

350
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:07,508
Look here.

351
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:09,775
That's me!

352
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:12,515
It is you.

353
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,114
Me...?

354
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,521
You are lying.

355
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,854
I am not lying.
I never lie.

356
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:25,696
"Honestly' you are the
only one in my heart."

357
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:28,531
Yes!

358
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:33,729
Grandpa is calling me.

359
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:38,806
Coming!

360
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:43,137
Am I the one in your heart too?

361
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:52,623
When will he come?

362
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:01,496
Wait...

363
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:03,566
Come on.

364
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,161
All of them are fans of Suraj.

365
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,767
All the girls are craZy about Suraj.

366
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,100
- where is he?
- Upstairs. - Lets go.

367
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:14,877
Throw away the cigarette.

368
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,706
- Let's go.
- Right.

369
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,850
He's Hansmukh. I mentioned him.

370
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,784
Suraj's secretary.

371
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:30,121
Suraj...

372
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:33,463
- what happened to Suraj?
- He had an accident.

373
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:39,126
Yes. He lost his voice
but by God's grace he's fine.

374
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:41,802
Where is he?

375
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,541
He's just been discharged from
the hospital. He's resting.

376
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,543
Upstairs...

377
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,152
What happened to you?

378
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,159
How did the accident occur?

379
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:05,826
Why don't you speak?

380
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,499
Joking!

381
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,099
Making me a fool!

382
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:14,594
- I won't ever talk to you!
- But why?

383
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:17,097
- You almost killed me!
- So did you.

384
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:19,100
You went away to your
grandpa. What about that?

385
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:20,775
Did you think of what
would happen to Suraj?

386
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:23,844
Do you know one another?

387
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:25,776
You may not tell me.

388
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:29,109
But I have the birth certificate
of the man who will marry Radha.

389
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,581
"where does he live'
what business he runs.."

390
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:33,920
"What are his likes and dislikes'
what does he eat and drink..."

391
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,616
How much he loves you and you're
getting married on the 21st of July.

392
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,125
I also know that.

393
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:42,531
Radha is full of praise for you.

394
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:47,127
- Come in.
- We must leave.

395
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,131
- You must come 2 days early.
- Are you leaving?

396
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:54,976
We have to distribute lots of
cards. Do come for the wedding.

397
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:57,537
I'll be there 4 days before.

398
00:31:57,815 --> 00:31:59,544
Else how will Radha get married?

399
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,534
Take care of my Radha.

400
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,098
Don't worry' Suraj."

401
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,839
I'll take good care of your Radha.

402
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,129

431
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,665
Will you answer my question?

432
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:12,605
Whom do you love the most
in this wide world?

433
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:14,516
My mother.

434
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,120
One should love mother.

435
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:24,119
She gives us birth. Raises us

436
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,120
So the mother is the dearest.

437
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:36,605
"After your mother' whom do
you love the most in the world?"

438
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:39,609
My brother.

439
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:45,140
Yes. Do you know why?

440
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,877
He has nobody but me in this world.

441
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:49,917
I am his mother.

442
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,146
Why do I feel as if
today is Mother's Day?

443
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,559
What?

444
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,153
It would be better if
you didn't ask any more.

445
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:01,898
- You'll get the same answer.
- What's the matter?

446
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:05,158
"Mother' then the step mother
then the grandmother..."

447
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,093
Maternal grandmother..

448
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:09,834
Paternal grandmother...

449
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:13,599
Who is Hema?

450
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:17,103
Nobody. You said mother...

451
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:20,777
- Do you like apples?
- No.

452
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:22,585
Neither do I like them.

453
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:28,114
You didn't ask further.

454
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:30,616
If you had' I'd have said..."

455
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:32,618
I love you the most.

456
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:36,122
"From this day' you're
most important to me."

457
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:58,553
In 5 minutes.

458
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,151
I'll help you.

459
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:02,152
What happened??

460
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:05,156
You burnt your finger.

461
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,530
Is it burning a lot?

462
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,098
Is it hurting?
What do I do?

463
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:29,551
What are you doing?

464
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:43,599
Just 5 minutes.

465
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:51,630
What are you doing?
Nobody touches a hot pan.

466
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:53,807
See' it got burnt."

467
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:56,135
You act like a child.
Go sit on the dining table.

468
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:58,137
I'll get the breakfast.

469
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:02,743
I'll eat right here.

470
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:05,747
- Sit there.
- Why should I eat there?

471
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:09,421
I'll sit here and eat
while I watch my wife.

472
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:15,762
Turn around.

473
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:19,433
Turn a little..please

474
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:31,707
Why don't you wear blouses
with net at the back?

475
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:34,709
I don't like them.

476
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,518
They look nice.

477
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:40,522
Why do you tie your sari so high?

478
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,116
You can tie it a little lower.

479
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,121
Move away. It doesn't look good.

480
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:47,622
Of course it does.
Everyone wears them.

481
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:49,129
Girls who have no waist wear them.

482
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:52,125
And you have such a lovely waist.

483
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:54,627
Go and sit there quietly.

484
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:57,801
Shut your mouth and
eat this hot paratha.

485
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:02,135
How can I eat with my mouth shut?

486
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,142
Joking?

487
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:07,583
- Like my joke?
- I'd laugh if it were funny.

488
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,578
Yes Dinesh?

489
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:15,822
Not tonight.

490
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,560
No way.

491
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:23,089
"I've just got married.
I'll spend time' talk to my wife."

492
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,591
I'll romance her.

493
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,867
"No' is it more
important than my wife?"

494
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,097
Explain to him' I can't come."

495
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,771
Who said that? Nana?

496
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,511
Take him.

497
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,514
My road will be clear
if you take Nana.

498
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,781
- Sis...
- What is it?

499
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,783
I want some money.

500
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,592
Money...how much?

501
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,118
- Only Rs. 5000.
- 5000?

502
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:56,629
I want a second hand motor
cycle like the one Amit rides.

503
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,131
- So..
- I don't have that much.

504
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,800
But I'll talk to grandpa..

505
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:02,872
- Brother-in-law..
- What's up?

506
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,131
Sis will talk to grandpa.

507
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,474
I see...

508
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:12,480
What are you doing?

509
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:15,083
- Nothing.
- Then do something.

510
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:17,080
There's a new video on Amitabh.

511
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:20,420
Right. Sis' grandpa.."

512
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:22,582
- What grandpa? Go on.
- Okay.

513
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:24,583
Watch the complete thing.
Don't come back halfway.

514
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:29,088
- Where are you going?
- To cook for grandpa.

515
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,824
Everyone only talks of grandpa!

516
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:34,570
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

517
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:36,436
You start off anywhere.

518
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:39,871
All day you're in the kitchen
and I'm in the office.

519
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:43,102
Today I've cancelled all
meetings and come home.

520
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:46,708
- Come here.
- What..? Grandpa might come..

521
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:48,607
To blaZes with grand...

522
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,119
What's wrong with Radha?

523
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:58,856
Nothing. She felt faint.

524
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:00,528
Faint..?

525
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:02,530
- Now she's fine.
- Yes.

526
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:05,124
I got worried. What..?

527
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,403
No...don't worry.
I'll handle everything.

528
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:10,062
Sis' what happened?"

529
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:12,064
Nothing is wrong with your sis.

530
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:15,068
Nothing is wrong.
He'll handle it.

531
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,672
Are you well?

532
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:20,073
- Go and watch video.
- Come on.

533
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:22,416
What's wrong with sis...

534
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:24,816
Why are you giggling?

535
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:28,490
Come on.

536
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:30,583
Brother...

537
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,495
It must be here..

538
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:36,498
"- Did uncle come here?
- Who? Yes' he's gone in."

539
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:38,500
Okay.

540
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:41,768
What are you doing?

541
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:45,598
I'm trying but can't get anywhere.
Nothing. I'm looking for something.

542
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:48,943
- What are you looking for?
- You want uncle. Go in.

543
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:52,110
Go in.

544
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:58,611
I like to see you mad.

545
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:02,115
I'll first settle the
matter of grandpa.

546
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:08,463
Did you call?

547
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:10,556
Yes' please sit here."

548
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:15,061
I've booked you for
tomorrow morning to Benares.

549
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:18,469
"You'll go there' visit
the 4 places of worship."

550
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:20,873
Everything has been arranged.

551
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,076
How?

552
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,480
I have to first see
the faces of my grand kids.

553
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:31,077
"lf you want to see your
grand kids' you have to go."

554
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:36,582
You'd taken a pledge.
That has to be fulfilled.

555
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:38,857
- That can be done here.
- Yes.

556
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:40,825
No' she knows nothing."

557
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,431
It will be more effective
if you go there and ask.

558
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:46,091
Don't you always say it?

559
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:49,762
So will you go tomorrow morning?

560
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:53,099
- Definite?
- Yes.

561
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:58,775
Then go and finish packing.

562
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:03,848
"- Help me' dear.
- All right."

563
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:17,566
Sent one packing.

564
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:19,864
Uncle just doesn't understand.

565
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:23,629
Now if anyone disturbs
one by one..

566
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:27,474
I'll send everyone packing.

567
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:30,545
What happened?

568
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:33,146
Are you talking to yourself?

569
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:35,882
Nothing. I was spraying perfume.

570
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:39,147
- Milk.
- Thanks. Wear some.

571
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:42,148
Packed uncle's bags?

572
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,650
Packed some food too?

573
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:49,155
Did you check' nothing left?"

574
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:50,830
All done.

575
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:53,830
- Sure he'll leave in the morning?
- Yes.

576
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:58,835
So now nobody will interrupt us.

577
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,172
What are you doing?

578
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:03,908
I'm thinking of playing
some football with you.

579
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:06,445
Or let's play volleyball

580
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:11,110
First switch off the light.

581
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:14,120
The lights won't be switched off.

582
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:24,395
Check the phone.

583
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:29,128
"Whoever it is' tell him
I'm busy. Playing football."

584
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:33,132
"Not football. Say'
I'm fast asleep."

585
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:34,641
Not to disturb me.

586
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:36,142
- Ask them to call in the morning
- Morning?

587
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:42,550
What are you doing?

588
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:46,147
What am I doing? Nothing.

589
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:47,889
Did I disturb you?

590
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:51,821
- No..didn't disturb.
- Cover up and talk.

591
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:54,824
- Is there a medicine to stop?
- Stop what?

592
00:48:58,168 --> 00:49:00,500
How...You must have eaten something.

593
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:04,163
- What did you eat?
- Little gravy at a party.

594
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:07,099
I ate just once and
went to the loo 15 times!

595
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,101
Why didn't you take some medicine?

596
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,843
"Since you got married' I don't
know what's where in this house!"

597
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,516
So you need me?

598
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,848
Okay. Where are you?

599
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,612
- At home. Where else?
- I know that.

600
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:22,785
- But where?
- In the hall.

601
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,117
Go up to the bedroom.

602
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,960
What is it? He's got loose motions!

603
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,531
Loose motions

604
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:32,133
- Tell him to consume Tik 20
- No.. - No?

605
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,135
- He had to call now!
- Have you reached?

606
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:37,631
I can't walk any faster.

607
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:41,542
What..?

608
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,805
I'm in bad shape and you're laughing!

609
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,811
That is why I say' eat in limits."

610
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,484
And you jump into the
pot on seeing curry!

611
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,622
But it didn't say..

612
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,149
- What?
- Shall I talk?

613
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,159
Look at your hair.

614
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:03,155
Not you...reached?

615
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,161
Yes' almost there."

616
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:08,103
- I'm there.
- See the cupboard?

617
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:10,437
Yes...one minute!

618
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:13,508
"- What's up?
- Hold on' I'm coming."

619
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:20,106
"- Line got cut?
- No' he's gone to the toilet."

620
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,113
Does he go alone?

621
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,553
- Stop joking.
- Wonderful.

622
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:35,121
- Yes?
- Open the cupboard.

623
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:39,125
- Opened.
- See the books?

624
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,131
The medicine is behind the books.

625
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,607
Yes' found it."

626
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:46,609
Take 2 pills.

627
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:49,135
- Water...
- Drink lots of water.

628
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:53,139
- Listen...- Switch
off the light? - One minute.

629
00:50:58,155 --> 00:51:02,558
If your condition worsens' call me."

630
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,491
I'll come there with him.

631
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:06,891
- Don't hesitate.
- Shall we go now?

632
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:08,894
- Let's go.
- No.

633
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:14,100
What a pain!

634
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:16,762
There's nobody to look after him.

635
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:18,438
Poor Suraj.

636
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:20,774
Why doesn't he get married?

637
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:22,544
You tell him.

638
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:24,512
I will tell him when we meet next.

639
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:28,448
What game?

640
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:42,125
Now let me see how he calls!

641
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:02,641
Son' you appear worried."

642
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:07,089
- Why?
- Just asked.

643
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:11,083
You know our neighbour' Shyamlal?"

644
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:13,824
You know his son' Mahesh well"

645
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:17,493
The poor man was always
worried after his marriage.

646
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:21,935
- Why?
- He has a big family.

647
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:26,833
As a result neither could the
couple talk not be together.

648
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:30,602
He came to me.

649
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:32,604
Fell at my feet and begged..

650
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:37,113
I solved his problem in 2 minutes.

651
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:42,614
Uncle...

652
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,791
What did you advise him?

653
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:47,120
Forget about what I said.

654
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:51,132
- Tell me.
- If you insist.

655
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:57,804
I told him to take his wife far away.

656
00:52:58,141 --> 00:53:01,804
To another city. Stay
together for 24 hours.

657
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:04,136
Have a great time.

658
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:07,082
That ended their problems.

659
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:09,075
- Really?
- Yes.

660
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:11,815
They still acknowledge me.

661
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:17,087
Why are you telling me this?

662
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:22,087
Do I look like a fool? Go.

663
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:48,522
What's the matter?

664
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:50,456
You're looking great today.

665
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:52,125
Wasn't I looking good yesterday?

666
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:54,859
Yes but today you're
looking even better.

667
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:59,130
- Why?
- Because we're going to SwitZerland

668
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:04,629
That's very far!

669
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,069
That is why we're going.

670
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:13,541
- No! I won't go.
- Why?

671
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:18,077
- It's very cold out there.
- So we'll take some woolens.

672
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,579
If I still feel cold?

673
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,490
I am with you.

674
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,687
Will we fly?

675
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,828
I might feel nausea in the plane

676
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:33,766
So...nothing.

677
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,698
I'll carry lots of lemons.

678
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,597
I'll make you lime juice.

679
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,102
Who will look after
Prashant and Neeta?

680
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:45,504
I'd forgotten about them.

681
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:47,114
- We'll take them along
- Really?

682
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,941
- We'll take the neighbours too.
- That will be nice.

683
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,614
Our honeymoon...

684
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,461
You..me. Me and you...

685
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,622
And nobody else between.

686
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,533
Really?

687
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,735
- Forget it.
- It's ringing.

688
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:17,069
I'll take it. You put this away.

689
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:25,084
Yes' it's me."

690
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:28,480
"- I too am me.
- Sir' Suraj here."

691
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,088
Yes Suraj?

692
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:34,088
- Can I talk with Radha?
- Why? Don't like talking to me?

693
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:40,092
- How are you?
- Great.

694
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:43,102
- Ask me why
- Why?

695
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:45,104
- Because I'm going abroad.
- Where?

696
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:49,842
- When?
- In 2 days.

697
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:52,104
Let's go together!
We're also going then!

698
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:54,845
- What's it?
- Not to you.

699
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:57,518
Carry woolens. It's very cold there.

700
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:02,114
And also carry the
sweater I knitted for you.

701
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:04,957
- Don't forget!
- How can I forget it?

702
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:09,062
You knitted a sweater for Suraj?

703
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:13,467
"Listen' Suraj is also
going to SwitZerland."

704
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:19,064
But..I was thinking
maybe you were right.

705
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:21,404
- We won't go.
- Why?

706
00:56:22,078 --> 00:56:24,069
You said it will be cold..

707
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:26,810
But you said we'll carry woolens.

708
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:30,814
"But it's a long journey and
you say' you'll feel sick."

709
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:34,822
Yes...but you said
you'll make me lime juice.

710
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:37,753
- Yes.
- Then we'll go?

711
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:41,091
But where are you going now?

712
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:43,497
To buy limes.

713
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:46,497
"- Get 3..
- Yes' one for Suraj."

714
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,442
Our honeymoon and
Suraj accompanies us.

715
00:56:57,781 --> 00:56:58,110
Spoilsport!

716
00:56:59,115 --> 00:57:00,605
I'll see...

717
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:22,127
I'd bought a ticket to SwitZerland
but I don't want to go there.

718
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:23,734
Can you please change it?

719
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:27,132
But a while ago you were
pressing for SwitZerland.

720
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:28,875
In fact you were fighting.

721
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:32,546
"But now I'm saying'
I don't want to go there."

722
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:35,140
I want to go anywhere else.
Give me tickets to Scotland.

723
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:39,621
Netherlands?

724
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:41,646
Not available.

725
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:47,652
What's this land?

726
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,160
Yes' give me tickets to Thailand."

727
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:56,664
"why do you keep saying sorry?
I said' any land will do for me."

728
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,171
Except for SwitZerland.

729
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:01,166
- Talk sense to her.
- Go to the international airport.

730
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:02,842
They'll solve your problem.

731
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:05,170
Give me back the ticket.

732
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:11,848
Did I ask you?

733
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:14,112
First wear decent clothes
Then give out advice.

734
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:19,458
Give her a ticket to SwitZerland.

735
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:22,117
""l am yours' my love"""

736
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:26,527
""My love' I belong to you"""

737
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:34,127

""l swear by everything I hold dear"""

742
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:56,557
""Never shall we part"""

743
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,466
""These beautiful moments.."""

744
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,627
""When we meet"""

745
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:49,136
"""We won't ever forget

746

747
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,549
""I'm restless every moment"""

748
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:58,950
""Never will our love decrease"""

749
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:03,152
""l belong to you"""

750
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:04,484
"""l want you to live in
every heart beat of mine"""

751
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:09,824
"""l want to hide you from
the world in my eyes"""

752
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:17,095
"""Every time I open my eyes
I want to see only you"""

753
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:20,433
""Never should we stay apart"""

754
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:36,114
"""l swear by everything
that I love so dearly"""

755
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,520
""Never shall we part"""

756
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,993
"- This is Radha's house' right?
- Radha's upstairs."

757
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:21,093
Upstairs? All right.

758
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:32,998
Suraj' come on in."

759
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:36,905
Don't talk to me. I went mad
looking for you in SwitZerland.

760
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:40,440
Know what? He said something
was wrong with the tickets...

761
01:03:40,783 --> 01:03:43,343
so we didn't go to SwitZerland.
- Where did you go then?

762
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:47,113
I don't know where we went either.
But whichever place it was...

763
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:49,791
it was very beautiful.
There were so many flowers...

764
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:52,121
greenery and cold...
it was great fun.

765
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:54,722
"l had even telephoned you'
but couldn't get through to you."

766
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:56,387
You're still a kid.

767
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,727
What have you brought for me.
- For you? Here is it.

768
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:04,472
This shirt.

769
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:09,534
I like this even more.
- This? All right.

770
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:12,609
"l got it for my husband'
but you may keep it."

771
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:15,474
I'll give him this one.

772
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:18,417
Want me to wear it?
- Sure.

773
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:23,358
What are you up to?
What?

774
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:26,393
What are you doing?
- I'm trying this shirt.

775
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:29,690
Aren't you ashamed to strip
before another man's wife?

776
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:31,433
Ill-mannered man!

777
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:34,765
Don't you dare take off your
shirt before anyone else again!

778
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:37,096
"Bloody body-builder.
- Yes' I'm a body-builder."

779
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:39,704
"My body' I take off the shirt.
Take off yours' if you have a body."

780
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:42,003
"Don't touch me!
She's my wife' this is my bedroom."

781
01:04:42,111 --> 01:04:43,669
I'll do what I please
and you can't!

782
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:46,076
She's your wife now.
- Was she yours earlier?

783
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:58,355
"What happened' sir?
- Nothing."

784
01:04:58,527 --> 01:05:00,927
"You were saying ""No""?
- Actually..."

785
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:03,928
"someone was getting a wrong number
of the mobile' so I said ""no""'

786
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:07,067
"Don't give your number to anyone'
you'll get a lot of wrong calls."

787
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,496
"Actually' one musn't even give
the residence number to anyone."

788
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:10,936
He's right.

789
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:13,937
How was your tour?

790
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:17,535
And you didn't go to SwitZerland.

791
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,948
What do you think of this shirt?
- Very nice...

792
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:25,076
Iooks like it was bought for you.
- I wore it for the heck of it

793
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:27,583
Why're you taking off your shirt?
Don't take it off.

794
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:34,822
I don't use things people have
already used. That's my policy.

795
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,900
"l have a policy too' sir.
- What?"

796
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:42,368
My policy is that I use anything
belonging to others.

797
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:49,110
I know that.

798
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:55,106
"Tell me something' Suraj.
Why don't you get married?"

799
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:58,648
"Yes' Suraj. You must tell him.
He keeps asking me all the time."

800
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:03,455
"Now that the two of you're married'
I think I've got married."

801
01:06:03,859 --> 01:06:06,293
"Whenever I'm hungry'
I come here for a meal."

802
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:09,931
"When I'm bored' I come here.
When I'm in the need for mischief..."

803
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:12,191
I come here. And when I need
some kids...

804
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:14,929
What?
- I'll tell the two of you...

805
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:17,402
"to have some children'
so I can play with them."

806
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:20,204
So you want the two of us
to do everything for you?

807
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:27,072
I'm leaving.
- So soon?

808
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:30,214
I've got work to do. Lots of it.
And Sir's here anyway.

809
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:32,420
I don't mind leaving either.

810
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:37,082
Now what was I saying? What?
- Mischief.

811
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,890
Before that?
- Children?

812
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:43,429
After that... I remember.
Sir...

813
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,091
Lay off. This is men-talk.

814
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:49,100
You made me forget it!
- Go on.

815
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:51,505
Oh yes' I remember."

816
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:55,107
I'll tell you later.
- Tell me now.

817
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:56,439
Later...

818
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:58,843
No greater fun than suspense' sir."

819
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:08,380
You're still a kid.

820
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:13,119
Looks good.
I'll go and cook.

821
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:20,468
The kid...? And the body-builder?

822
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:24,129
Body-builder...? No.

823
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:30,138
It's okay.

824
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:40,316
I won't ask you today what I've been
asking you everyday in three years.

825
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:44,151
"lt isn't about how you are'
what you ate and drank..."

826
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:47,158
about when you went to sleep
and woke up. No way.

827
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:49,760
I'm going to discuss something
very important with you today.

828
01:07:49,965 --> 01:07:51,489
It's that...

829
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:57,164
the world is making
such great progress.

830
01:07:57,573 --> 01:08:01,168
"ln every department'
progress is the catchword."

831
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:06,706
"People have a cell-phone in one hand'
and a girlfriend in the other."

832
01:08:07,183 --> 01:08:10,778
But the tragedy about
my life is that...

833
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:13,454
I'm still where I was
three years ago.

834
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:20,585
I sure do have a mobile-phone.
But the girlfriend is missing.

835
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:24,861
You get what I'm saying?
No...? I'll explain.

836
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:30,536
My life can also make progress
provided you say just one thing.

837
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:36,143
You must tell me...
that you love me.

838
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:43,917
"Should you say that' I'll think
where man has reached the moon..."

839
01:08:44,186 --> 01:08:48,145
I've gone far beyond.
I'll wait for 10 seconds then...

840
01:08:48,557 --> 01:08:50,752
for your response.

841
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:53,692
One.

842
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:56,755
Two.

843
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:09,968
I love you too.

844
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:14,105
I'll give Radha the good news
and call you back.

845
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,010
Let me go there.
The phone's ringing.

846
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:21,851
"Forget it' Radha. There are people
in the hall' someone will pick it up."

847
01:09:22,124 --> 01:09:24,615
Help me with this tie.
- I don't know how to tie it.

848
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:27,591
How don't you?
I'll show you.

849
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:31,462
Very simple.
Put this one on that.

850
01:09:34,136 --> 01:09:36,127
Pull it now.

851
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:42,871
Stand straight. How'll I tie it?
- That's just the way. Pull it.

852
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:47,809
What are you doing? Let me go.
- What is it?

853
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:50,875
But this is the way.
Pull it!

854
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:53,945
Someone might see us...
- No one will see us.

855
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:56,351
You start this anywhere.
- I'm with my wife.

856
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:59,551
But we're in the hall!
- Must I find another one for the hall?

857
01:10:00,896 --> 01:10:03,160
Radha dear... it's a call
from Suraj.

858
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:05,894
One moment' okay?"

859
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:17,845
Now look. I have something
very important to tell you.

860
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:20,478
Not now. He's preparing
to leave for the office.

861
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:24,109
At what time will your husband
set out for the office?

862
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:27,115
In another 10 or 15 minutes.
- I'll call you in 10 minutes then.

863
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:30,481
"No' I'll give you a call
after he has left for the office."

864
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,531
Let me tie it for you.

865
01:10:48,877 --> 01:10:51,402
It's okay. I'm getting
late for the office.

866
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:57,676
"When you find time from the telephone'
learn to tie this."

867
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:02,888
What are you doing...?
It's very tight!

868
01:11:10,132 --> 01:11:13,101
He gets angry because I can't
help him with the tie!

869
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:21,099
"I've done it' sis!
- Why're you yelling?"

870
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:24,104
"l got a call through to the programme
""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"""

871
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:27,347
They asked me a question
and I gave them the right answer.

872
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:31,685
"When I'm on the show' sis'
I'll call you for help."

873
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,855
You must help me with the answer
and we'll make 10 million rupees.

874
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:39,993
"Let's give your husband some.
Some to Kaka' Nana' Suraj..."

875
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:42,925
"and lots of it to Neeta.
She spends a lot' right?"

876
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:47,125
Big deal! You look
like a monkey right now.

877
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:49,027
What's that on your forehead?

878
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:54,140
Like you have this tie around
your neck... your husband-style.

879
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,875
No style at all.
He forced it around my neck.

880
01:11:59,214 --> 01:12:01,614
I've been trying to take it off.
But it won't.

881
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:04,850
"How do you take it off?
- This is a small problem' sis."

882
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:08,088
"When I win 10 million'
I'll solve all your problems."

883
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:11,081
But I have a problem right now.
- What problem?

884
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:13,884
I have nice clothes to wear.
But I have no money.

885
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:16,087
Your problem will be
solved tomorrow.

886
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:37,118
Coming' brother-in-law."

887
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,519
Yes?

888
01:12:39,922 --> 01:12:41,913
Why did you need 5000 rupees?

889
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:48,529
I saw this motorcycle. And so...
- So you took it?

890
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:50,723
What are you talking about?

891
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:52,489
I swear' I haven't..."

892
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:57,131
Now listen. I hate liars
and thieves.

893
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:02,143
And button up this shirt.

894
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:06,875
"You're making a mistake' brother-in-law.
I haven't stolen anything."

895
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:15,079
Please believe me...
I haven't stolen anything.

896
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:21,493
"But' brother-in-law...
I haven't stolen anything."

897
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:46,512
What's up? You didn't
hand the glass to me.

898
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:56,655
Radha... what happened?

899
01:13:57,466 --> 01:13:59,798
How could you call
my brother a thief?

900
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:05,939
It's nothing of the sort.
Let's sit down and talk it over.

901
01:14:06,408 --> 01:14:08,069
Sit down.

902
01:14:10,746 --> 01:14:14,807
All I told Prashant is that
if he ever needs something...

903
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:17,643
he must ask me for it.
- No. You called him a thief.

904
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:20,084
"He must've been so hurt.
- Sit down' Radha."

905
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:24,091
Don't be silly. Whatever I told him
was in his own welfare.

906
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:26,350
There has never been
a theft in this house.

907
01:14:26,495 --> 01:14:29,089
"Really? Now that we've arrived'
thefts are taking place?"

908
01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:31,495
Did I say that?
- You've always been insulting him.

909
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:35,670
And you accuse him of theft today?
What do you think he is?

910
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:39,572
"We're not vagabonds either.
We have imbibed good values' too."

911
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:42,102
"lf you don't like him staying here'
just throw him out."

912
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:46,580
"Enough. That I'm quiet' doesn't mean
you can say anything to me."

913
01:14:47,382 --> 01:14:49,111
Such a thing...

914
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:57,124
"l was late for college
yesterday' brother."

915
01:14:57,559 --> 01:15:01,120
I had to pay my fees. So I took
5000 rupees from your wallet.

916
01:15:12,474 --> 01:15:17,070
Why didn't you ask me for the money?
You could have asked me for it!

917
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:20,080
"You ought to have asked me.
Isn't it' Neeta?"

918
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:30,818
"l told you' my brother is not a thief.
- Enough! Enough!"

919
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:38,891
Prashant asked you for money
yesterday. Didn't he...?

920
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,696
Did you ask me for it...? Did you?

921
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:44,231
So what will I think if I find
money missing at home?

922
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:46,102
And nobody asks me for anything.
What am I anyway...?

923
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,766
What am I in this house?
- No...

924
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:51,573
No! You and your brother are right!
We're the ones who make mistakes!

925
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:53,775
I didn't say anything of the sort.

926
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:58,112
What are you doing...?
- I'm sorry... okay?

927
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:27,071
I said I'm sorry' didn't l?"

928
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:30,810
"You shouldn't have taken money from
my wallet' without asking me for it."

929
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:32,711
It's wrong.

930
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:36,080
See what problems it has caused?

931
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:40,751
"I'd never mind it' no matter
how much you hit me."

932
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:47,491
What I feel sad about is that you
hit me in the presence of your wife.

933
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:59,710
Where did it hurt you...?
Here?

934
01:17:00,315 --> 01:17:03,113
Here...? Of was it here?

935
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,112
Brother...
- Relax. I've got to go the office.

936
01:17:16,598 --> 01:17:20,125
"Prashant' switch off the TV.
It's time for my husband to return."

937
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:24,567
Change the bulb in
the bathroom; it has fused.

938
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:29,128
Neeta' wait..."

939
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:33,471
"Listen to me' Neeta.
You're making a mistake."

940
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:38,144
"Wait' Neeta...
- Don't touch me!"

941
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:40,947
Listen to me...
- Don't talk to me.

942
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:43,478
I didn't know you'd come
to the bathroom.

943
01:18:44,152 --> 01:18:46,484
"Go away!
- Believe me' Neeta."

944
01:18:46,822 --> 01:18:51,316
I wasn't in the bathroom on purpose.
My sister told me to...

945
01:18:51,693 --> 01:18:54,161
Your sister asked you to
go and watch me bathing?

946
01:18:55,163 --> 01:18:58,155
How can you say such a thing?
Why'd my sister say that?

947
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:01,162
It's just that...

948
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:04,536
How was I to know that you'd
suddenly land in that bathroom?

949
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:07,641
This is my house! And I will
bathe in any bathroom I wish!

950
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:11,568
And I couldn't even imagine
you'd be such a creep!

951
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:15,910
"lf I tell my brother'
he'll give you a thrashing."

952
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:21,117
I didn't watch you bathing. I swear.

953
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:26,456
"lf my sister gets to know about this'
I won't be able to face her."

954
01:19:43,478 --> 01:19:46,140
Sister... believe me...

955
01:19:55,323 --> 01:19:59,589
"Listen to me' sister...
believe me' I did nothing wrong."

956
01:19:59,761 --> 01:20:00,750
God!

957
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:04,890
"l swear it on you' sister.
I don't care what they think."

958
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:10,203
But you mustn't misunderstand me.
And you told me to go there...

959
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:14,433
"Yes' I did. Could you walk out'
when she went in there?"

960
01:20:15,777 --> 01:20:20,510
You say you didn't see anything.
But who will believe you? Who?

961
01:20:22,551 --> 01:20:25,111
"When she came there' didn't you
have the sense to...?"

962
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:31,117
How could you do this...?
What can I do about it now?

963
01:20:52,714 --> 01:20:55,148
Open the door' Neeta."

964
01:21:09,264 --> 01:21:12,495
"Gopal...
- What happened' Radha?"

965
01:21:13,168 --> 01:21:16,160
"Why are you crying?
- Nothing has happened' son."

966
01:21:17,806 --> 01:21:19,797
Nothing.
- Is that why she's crying?

967
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:22,440
What is the matter?

968
01:21:25,847 --> 01:21:27,712
What is it? Why's she crying?

969
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:30,384
"Nothing has happened.
- One minute' Kaka. I'm talking."

970
01:21:31,152 --> 01:21:33,916
Did you say something to her...?
Will someone tell me what happened?

971
01:21:39,594 --> 01:21:40,686
Brother...

972
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:50,127
What happened' Neeta?"

973
01:21:51,473 --> 01:21:54,374
I'll explain... please!
- One minute. Enough!

974
01:22:03,485 --> 01:22:04,747
Sister...

975
01:22:09,491 --> 01:22:13,086
"Prashant' your brother-in-law
is terribly angry right now."

976
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:16,096
You can come back
when he has cooled down.

977
01:22:18,166 --> 01:22:20,361
Sister...
- Don't talk to me.

978
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:23,764
"Go on' son. Come back later.
Go now."

979
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:51,121
Neeta is making a mistake...

980
01:22:51,366 --> 01:22:53,357
What the hell have you done?
