1
00:01:29,202 --> 00:01:30,533
When will the bus reach Siripuram?

2
00:01:30,704 --> 00:01:33,366
lt'll take another 20 minutes,
l'll wake you up, go to sleep.

3
00:01:41,047 --> 00:01:43,880
A week earlier...

4
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,052
Buddy! Why did they beat you?
- What happened?

5
00:01:49,222 --> 00:01:50,553
Dog...it almost killed me.

6
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:52,817
Dog?
Are you running scared of a dog?

7
00:01:53,393 --> 00:01:55,224
Do you know what for we're here now?

8
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:56,555
To lynch the man who beat you.

9
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,560
But don't know why he beat you.

10
00:01:57,731 --> 00:01:59,221
He was in terrific mood,
so he bashed me up.

11
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:00,388
Will he beat if he's in mood?

12
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:02,398
He will, he's different.
- So arrogant?

13
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:03,228
More than it!

14
00:02:03,403 --> 00:02:05,234
Arrogance or wealth?
- ln everything.

15
00:02:05,405 --> 00:02:08,568
lf Ambani sleeps for 7 hours,
our PJ sleeps for 14 hours,

16
00:02:08,742 --> 00:02:11,734
by the time he wakes up,
half of our day would be over.

17
00:02:15,749 --> 00:02:17,740
Let's bait for him in the evening,
if morning is not possible.

18
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:20,910
There would be hundreds of
people around him always.

19
00:02:21,087 --> 00:02:23,248
But he behaves as if he's all alone.

20
00:02:23,423 --> 00:02:25,584
He's more idiotic than me.

21
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,987
We don't believe it.

22
00:02:31,765 --> 00:02:32,424
Can't you wake him up?

23
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:35,090
We've had it from Sunday to Friday.

24
00:02:35,268 --> 00:02:37,759
Today is...?
- Saturday! Your chance!

25
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,930
l'll not wake him.
- He'll beat for not waking him up.

26
00:02:42,776 --> 00:02:43,606
Then, l'll wake him.

27
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:45,267
He'll beat for waking him up.

28
00:03:02,462 --> 00:03:03,622
Why pick a bottle sir?

29
00:03:03,797 --> 00:03:06,129
Darkness is falling sir,
please wake up sir.

30
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:11,293
We can get him only after bars
and pubs close in the city.

31
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:15,635
That's why l've chosen 4 am time,
taking Anacin to keep away sleep.

32
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:18,300
Anyway Anacin isn't to keep awake.
- ls it?

33
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:27,714
He's here again!

34
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:42,657
Hey PJ! l've warned...

35
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:45,494
Fight or scene?

36
00:03:46,506 --> 00:03:48,667
lt's a fight!
Say fight.

37
00:03:48,842 --> 00:03:49,672
lt's fight!

38
00:03:49,843 --> 00:03:52,505
Delivering dialogues
saying fight, bloody...

39
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,010
What happened?

40
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:57,081
Bash him boys!

41
00:03:58,518 --> 00:04:00,008
Who paid the bill?
- You!

42
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:02,177
Who should fight?
- You!

43
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,350
Don't you've brothers?
- We do.

44
00:04:08,528 --> 00:04:10,519
Why are you seeing here then?
Take care of him.

45
00:04:27,714 --> 00:04:28,408
Come on man!

46
00:04:33,386 --> 00:04:36,048
Hey, this is not Bhimli,
this is Hyderabad!

47
00:04:39,059 --> 00:04:40,219
Come in 5 minutes.

48
00:04:41,394 --> 00:04:42,224
Okay go.

49
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:02,742
Break is over! lt's climax now!

50
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,343
l need another break, PJ!

51
00:05:08,922 --> 00:05:11,083
Look there! People are fighting!

52
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:13,756
Stop! Let's settle things
with discussion.

53
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:16,157
Let's discuss and settle things.

54
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,420
How dare you beat a constable!
- He's policeman!

55
00:05:18,598 --> 00:05:20,589
l'm talking to him, right?
- Talk to him.

56
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,602
How much more time for
this silly procedures?

57
00:05:26,773 --> 00:05:27,933
l'm getting late to the celebrations.

58
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:31,600
You get involved in brawls and visit
stations quite a few times monthly,

59
00:05:31,778 --> 00:05:33,769
don't you know how much time
it takes for the formalities?

60
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:38,782
lf he speaks one more word,
you may've to bail me out again.

61
00:05:38,952 --> 00:05:39,782
No need of that.

62
00:05:39,953 --> 00:05:41,113
He beat me, sir.

63
00:05:41,287 --> 00:05:43,278
Raja Babu, l want to talk to you.

64
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:45,617
l'll talk to anyone
when l feel like talking.

65
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:48,621
lf you want to talk to me...

66
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:06,476
Make a life size of it.

67
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:19,322
He's very proud!

68
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:34,334
Wait sir, l'll tell the matter
in one shot.

69
00:06:34,507 --> 00:06:37,499
l'm Lord of Krishnagiri kingdom.

70
00:06:37,677 --> 00:06:41,841
One and only heir to the tune
of 5000 crores wealth,

71
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:45,178
which has property, factories,
jewellary, farmlands, etc.,

72
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:47,512
the point is l'm major from today,

73
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:51,684
l mean everything is my will
and wish from today.

74
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:54,023
Why are you getting so emotional?

75
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:58,187
They've entertained me till now,
let me spare them few golden words.

76
00:06:58,364 --> 00:07:00,195
Taking useless Rs.3000
and odd as salary

77
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:02,857
by a useless worker from
a useless boss,

78
00:07:03,036 --> 00:07:07,700
giving it to wife scolding
her she's useless,

79
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:08,863
due to an useless incident resulting
in giving birth to such useless children,

80
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:11,374
and getting them admitted into
such a useless college,

81
00:07:11,544 --> 00:07:13,876
to avoid you getting into such rut,
l'm telling you,

82
00:07:14,047 --> 00:07:15,207
study well!

83
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:20,375
Because you don't have
a rich grandpa like l do.

84
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:23,716
Sir, l've a suggestion for you too.

85
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:27,883
Learn to teach well, sir, l may feel
like buying this college in future,

86
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:31,220
and may feel like firing you,

87
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:38,393
today is my birthday,
evening l'm giving a party,

88
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:39,902
those who drink are welcome,

89
00:07:40,073 --> 00:07:42,234
those who don't drink
aren't PJ's friends,

90
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:52,748
l know Pedda Ramaraju very well.

91
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,250
He was a very good man.

92
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,412
But this boy is like Soni Sood
in the film 'Arundhati'.

93
00:07:58,925 --> 00:08:01,758
Since Praveen's parents died
when he was a boy,

94
00:08:02,095 --> 00:08:05,428
he grew up pampered like a prince,

95
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:10,262
they've sent him to this far
away college to reform him.- My fate!

96
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:12,097
But his behaviour is very bad, sir.

97
00:08:12,272 --> 00:08:15,435
For keeping him away from grandpa
and the wealth,

98
00:08:15,608 --> 00:08:18,941
he thinks we and studies have
kept him away and so hates us.

99
00:08:19,612 --> 00:08:20,943
Though grandpa died,

100
00:08:21,114 --> 00:08:27,952
the guardian committee managed to
keep him in college by hood or crook,

101
00:08:28,454 --> 00:08:34,620
the day he joined here he told he'll
stop studies as he turns major.

102
00:08:36,963 --> 00:08:38,123
Please don't take it serious.

103
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,964
lt seems you called me,
what do you want from me?

104
00:08:46,472 --> 00:08:50,135
Even if the necessity is yours,
you've to come to me.

105
00:08:52,145 --> 00:08:54,306
Though king is here,
you're still sitting,

106
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,311
l can understand your innocence.

107
00:08:56,482 --> 00:08:57,972
Who?
- You!

108
00:08:58,151 --> 00:09:00,642
PJ, you must behave like
this with elders.

109
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,981
lf not what sir?
l've told you before.

110
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:05,818
Studies bring me strange side effects.

111
00:09:05,992 --> 00:09:07,823
You've completed a year,

112
00:09:07,994 --> 00:09:11,157
if you word hard for two more years,
you'll get the degree.

113
00:09:11,331 --> 00:09:13,162
What do you want me
to do with it, sir?

114
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,166
l'll be in a position to offerjobs
to 100 people from tomorrow.

115
00:09:16,336 --> 00:09:19,828
Did you see his arrogance sir?
How can we adjust with his tantrums, sir?

116
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,001
Then apply for TC.

117
00:09:23,176 --> 00:09:26,168
Do l've to tell you that too sir?
Sign it yourself.

118
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:29,512
Now he got kick on his ass.

119
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:32,845
From today we're unknown strangers.

120
00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:39,522
lf you need any donation to the
college, come to my palace.

121
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:41,515
l'll throw it!

122
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:42,854
Start the vehicle!

123
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:55,370
He's another Ambani...

124
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,202
He's a walking currency note...

125
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,109
He's young man...

126
00:09:59,212 --> 00:10:01,043
By birth he's a fighter...

127
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:19,892
To take rest, he'll buy Everest...

128
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:27,905
One and only charming guy who
can give shivers to dollars...

129
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:39,411
He's a charming who falls
for praise...

130
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:43,248
He's a charming guy with
bags of cash..

131
00:10:43,423 --> 00:10:48,759
He says money is ageless...

132
00:10:56,602 --> 00:11:04,441
Dance to the folk beat
with classical steps...

133
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:08,102
Some ignorant man said
efforts can make a man sage...

134
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:11,944
But l say God is in money...

135
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:15,610
God is in money...
Money is God...

136
00:11:15,788 --> 00:11:19,781
l'm the God...
Money is my boon...

137
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:23,793
Abdul Kalam asked us to dream...

138
00:11:23,963 --> 00:11:27,296
But l, a Lord says buy those dreams...

139
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:31,130
He's poor in relatives
but rich in wealth...

140
00:11:31,304 --> 00:11:35,138
He hates sweat and hates to work...

141
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:38,971
Having fun is my life's aim...

142
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:42,979
l'm way away from sentiments...

143
00:12:16,015 --> 00:12:19,678
Crow...dark crow...when l kept
a lamp in it's mouth...

144
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:23,845
On giving the lamp to the mound...
Mound gave me grass...

145
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:27,356
l gave the grass to the cow...
Cow gave me milk...

146
00:12:27,527 --> 00:12:31,361
l gave the milk to the master...
Master taught me lesson...

147
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:35,194
l gave the lesson to uncle...Uncle gave
his daughter in marriage to me...

148
00:12:35,368 --> 00:12:40,362
Bride...me...jasmine buds...
what's his name? He's young lord!

149
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:46,868
l'll bath in champagne...
l'll supply petrol to Gulf....

150
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:50,538
Lend money to Bill Gates...
l'll show what arrogance is...

151
00:12:50,716 --> 00:12:54,379
Power that runs life is money...
life is money...

152
00:12:54,554 --> 00:12:58,217
Money runs the life...
money is life...

153
00:12:58,391 --> 00:13:02,384
Emboss Goddess Lakshmi's
image on Dollars...

154
00:13:02,562 --> 00:13:06,225
That's my idea...

155
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,891
The game l play is commonwealth...

156
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:13,732
The game l play is commonly wealth...

157
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:21,745
l'm there in love and friendship...

158
00:13:55,615 --> 00:13:56,877
Wait father.

159
00:13:57,283 --> 00:13:59,615
l've much to settle scores
with him, father.

160
00:14:00,786 --> 00:14:01,775
Go dear.

161
00:14:15,134 --> 00:14:16,123
What?

162
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:17,963
lt seems you're going away.
- So what?

163
00:14:18,137 --> 00:14:19,627
What have you decided about me?

164
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:22,304
l've to tell you once again, right?

165
00:14:24,644 --> 00:14:26,635
l mean my ex-lover Sindhu,

166
00:14:27,813 --> 00:14:29,144
l don't have anything to say.

167
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,643
Just one good bye forever, that's it!

168
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,651
You promised to be my life partner.

169
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:43,993
l saw you in a weak moment.
l liked you.

170
00:14:44,497 --> 00:14:46,829
We dated.
Mistook it as love.

171
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:48,830
But it isn't.

172
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:52,001
But my love for you is real.

173
00:14:52,171 --> 00:14:57,837
l'm like a pizza, and
you're like a betel leaf.

174
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:58,499
We don't gel together.

175
00:14:58,678 --> 00:15:01,340
Find some local man and marry him.

176
00:15:01,514 --> 00:15:03,004
l'll bear your marriage expenses too.

177
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:05,343
Bumper offer, special for you only.

178
00:15:06,852 --> 00:15:07,841
Don't play with emotions.

179
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,851
l never played with you.

180
00:15:10,022 --> 00:15:14,516
You were never honest in love with me.
- Me?

181
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:16,688
That's why l'm taking care of my future.

182
00:15:16,862 --> 00:15:19,353
l'm concerned about my status
and stature only.

183
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:40,049
Did you see dear,
he's not a human at all?

184
00:15:40,219 --> 00:15:42,380
Come dear, enough of this humiliation.

185
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:45,550
No need to stay here anymore.
Let's go home.

186
00:15:45,725 --> 00:15:46,885
Krishnagiri kingdom

187
00:15:52,898 --> 00:15:54,092
lt's wrong Raja babu.

188
00:15:55,401 --> 00:15:58,234
You know how you are?
- How am l?

189
00:15:58,404 --> 00:16:01,237
You look like an usherer
in a 5-star hotel.

190
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:05,900
Anyway people are waiting for me,
l'll come later.

191
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:07,067
Let me see.

192
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,582
Stop there!

193
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,752
Have free drinks and go away.

194
00:16:20,426 --> 00:16:21,484
Congrats son-in-law!

195
00:16:22,428 --> 00:16:24,760
Come Amrutha!
Sit next to him.

196
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:25,753
This seat is yours.

197
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:28,923
Why are you sitting here, baby?

198
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:31,430
The seat was empty so l...

199
00:16:31,604 --> 00:16:33,504
Will you sit on finding any seat free?

200
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:36,601
What are you waiting for?
Take her away.

201
00:16:38,944 --> 00:16:40,775
l think he's not in good mood, let's go.

202
00:16:45,284 --> 00:16:49,448
l, Rudraraju belonging to the
royal family of Veeranalla,

203
00:16:49,622 --> 00:16:53,615

intelligence and knowledge,

204
00:16:53,793 --> 00:16:57,126
the wealth left by my ancestors
and property l earned in my times,

205
00:16:57,296 --> 00:16:59,958
according to the direction
l am giving now,

206
00:17:00,132 --> 00:17:05,627
l order to be divided amongst
my heirs, relatives and dependents,

207
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:14,310
apart from it the 5000 crore worth
factories, property, farms,

208
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:22,319
l wish it be given to my
only heir Jayaramaraju,

209
00:17:23,322 --> 00:17:29,158
but Jayaramaraju has to qualify to
certain conditions to get the wealth.

210
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:34,162
Did grandpa write like that?
- Yes.

211
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,824
lf he fails to prove his qualification,

212
00:17:37,002 --> 00:17:41,336
l want the wealth be shared
by orphanages and temples,

213
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:43,668
and leave that responsibility on courts.

214
00:17:45,344 --> 00:17:46,504
What are you those conditions?

215
00:17:46,846 --> 00:17:50,839
First, Praveen must complete
his bachelor's degree,

216
00:17:52,518 --> 00:17:55,510
he must complete it in 3 years only!

217
00:17:56,689 --> 00:18:01,353
He must live in Siripuram Military
Rajanna hostel for those 3 years,

218
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:07,022
and must attend the
Mangamma Govt. College there.

219
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:08,856
Siripuram?
- Yes.

220
00:18:09,034 --> 00:18:10,524
Would you like to have water, sir?

221
00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:14,366
Satire on me?

222
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,872
This is for not opening my
car door earlier, get out!

223
00:18:19,044 --> 00:18:20,875
On accepting the above 3 conditions,

224
00:18:21,046 --> 00:18:24,880
the next condition will be intimated
3 months afterjoining the college.

225
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,381
Even if there's one subject arrear...

226
00:18:26,552 --> 00:18:28,247
Please hear it fully!

227
00:18:28,888 --> 00:18:29,718
Why?

228
00:18:29,889 --> 00:18:31,379
Can he pass the degree?

229
00:18:32,057 --> 00:18:35,220
l went around board with Rs.1 lakh
to get him through tenth class.

230
00:18:35,394 --> 00:18:37,726
No chance he'll pass and
get the property.

231
00:18:37,897 --> 00:18:39,728
Stop...why are you going away?

232
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,729
You're fired! You too are fired!
Go away!

233
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:46,394
You don't have any power to fire us.

234
00:18:46,572 --> 00:18:48,233
You haven't yet got the
reign in your hand.

235
00:18:48,407 --> 00:18:50,238
You've much more to hear.

236
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:51,239
Calling me informally?

237
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:55,904
Thank me for not using bad words.

238
00:18:56,081 --> 00:18:56,740
How else can a rich man
abuse a poor man than this! Joke?

239
00:18:58,584 --> 00:19:00,245
Poor...
- He'll never get the property.

240
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:03,081
Waiting for him is foolishness.

241
00:19:03,255 --> 00:19:05,746
No daddy...
let's talk to him once.

242
00:19:05,925 --> 00:19:07,916
See, how he changed thinking
l wouldn't get the wealth.

243
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:09,754
See, how he's dragging away that girl.

244
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:11,920
Don't divert the topic.

245
00:19:12,097 --> 00:19:16,761
The way 300 students are studying with
scholarships given by this kingdom,

246
00:19:16,936 --> 00:19:18,767
you too must study with that only.

247
00:19:18,938 --> 00:19:21,771
How?
- Taking Rs.2500!

248
00:19:21,941 --> 00:19:24,273
Rs.2500?
- For a month!

249
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:25,937
Dropping out?

250
00:19:26,946 --> 00:19:28,277
l never said l'm dropping.

251
00:19:33,786 --> 00:19:37,620
We're leaving to Siripuram,
pack my bags in the car.

252
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,280
Fill the tank.

253
00:19:44,463 --> 00:19:45,794
Why is he cutting the call?

254
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:49,457
Not just him, everyone of them
will cut the call for 3 years.

255
00:19:49,635 --> 00:19:53,298
No servants.
Nothing!

256
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:55,463
Must live like a common man.

257
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:58,132
Stop! lts cost is Rs.30000!

258
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:03,976
lf you break it, it'll be deducted
from your scholarship.

259
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:07,312
lf it's okay to you, break it.

260
00:20:08,487 --> 00:20:10,978
Where's he? Where the hell is he?

261
00:20:11,156 --> 00:20:14,353
l'm here, Raja babu.
- Are you here? l'm coming.

262
00:20:15,494 --> 00:20:16,654
Grandpa!

263
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:20,162
Though l've laid many conditions,
you still love me so much.

264
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:23,665
You bloody old wag!
- Oh my God!

265
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:25,500
No dear...

266
00:20:25,671 --> 00:20:27,502
You want to deny me getting this
property, right?- Not with that intention...

267
00:20:27,673 --> 00:20:29,504
l'll earn the degree and throw it
on the lawyer's face,

268
00:20:29,675 --> 00:20:31,006
and take this property,

269
00:20:31,176 --> 00:20:33,508
and spend it like hell
right before your eyes.

270
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,375
You keep watching from the photo,
l'll not let you rest in peace.

271
00:20:38,183 --> 00:20:40,845
What a tragedy! l'm speaking
with photos and walls!

272
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,180
Are you mad?

273
00:20:43,522 --> 00:20:45,012
l'll get the property.

274
00:20:48,193 --> 00:20:50,184
lf you give me my first year
certificate and TC...

275
00:20:50,362 --> 00:20:53,024
Who is it?
You look like prince!

276
00:20:53,198 --> 00:20:55,689
No sir, l'm Praveen.
- Praveen?

277
00:20:55,868 --> 00:21:00,032
l've gone absent minded for the
last two days and two hours.

278
00:21:00,205 --> 00:21:02,366
l don't remember who you are!

279
00:21:07,212 --> 00:21:09,043
You're an elderly man!
You know to forgive people!

280
00:21:09,214 --> 00:21:11,705
lf you give my certificates and TC,
l'll never show up again.

281
00:21:11,884 --> 00:21:14,717
Oh that one? You told me to
shove it somewhere, right?

282
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:17,549
May be my guys would've
shoved it somewhere.

283
00:21:18,724 --> 00:21:20,055
l think heard this dialogue!

284
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:24,552
Sir, please consider at least
as your college's alumni.

285
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,561
Did you study here?

286
00:21:26,732 --> 00:21:28,063
lf you get at least one person
to vouch for it,

287
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:30,064
l'll give your certificates and TC.

288
00:21:31,737 --> 00:21:33,898
Did you ever taught him?

289
00:21:34,073 --> 00:21:36,906
He doesn't know us and
we don't know who he is!

290
00:21:37,076 --> 00:21:40,739
There's no way l can give you TC.

291
00:21:41,747 --> 00:21:44,580
lf you want your lnter certificates,
come to my office,

292
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,913
l'll throw it on your face.
Start the vehicle!

293
00:21:51,924 --> 00:21:53,585
Stop the bus!

294
00:21:54,093 --> 00:21:55,583
Won't you get down?
- Why?

295
00:21:55,761 --> 00:21:57,922
Get down, we've reached Siripuram.

296
00:21:59,932 --> 00:22:01,763
Whose hen is this? Yours?

297
00:22:01,934 --> 00:22:04,095
Still didn't get down?

298
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:08,266
Looks like new to the place.

299
00:22:09,274 --> 00:22:10,104
l had another bag too.

300
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:13,438
Who knows?
Take care of your things yourself.
You go!

301
00:22:13,612 --> 00:22:15,477
Why are you throwing it?
You mad man!

302
00:22:15,781 --> 00:22:20,275

00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,621
Where can l find Rajanna hostel?

305
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:33,624
Who is this new variety kid?

306
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:35,790
Do you know where Rajanna hostel is?
- l know.

307
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:37,629
Show me the way.
- l'll not tell you.

308
00:22:37,803 --> 00:22:40,465
Do you where's the hostel?

309
00:22:41,473 --> 00:22:43,134
Do you know where
Military Rajanna hostel is?

310
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:46,641
Do you know you mustn't be on
road when Appi's tractor comes?

311
00:22:46,812 --> 00:22:48,473
ls he so great man?

312
00:22:50,816 --> 00:22:52,807
Hey Appi! You'll never change.

313
00:22:52,985 --> 00:22:54,816
What's that meeting on the road?
Bloody fools!

314
00:22:54,987 --> 00:22:57,319
Got it?
- Got wet!

315
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:09,657
This is Military Rajanna hostel!
- This one?

316
00:23:09,835 --> 00:23:11,166
lf you pay, l'll go.

317
00:23:13,005 --> 00:23:13,835
Take it.

318
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:32,354
Looks like a haunted house!

319
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:35,348
Why are you putting garbage
on me, you dirty man?

320
00:23:35,527 --> 00:23:37,518
You're a dirty man,

lf not you, am l calling
the rickshaw puller?- l'm coming.

325
00:23:52,878 --> 00:23:55,369
What's the Rajanna doing if people
dump garbage from upstairs?

326
00:23:55,547 --> 00:23:56,707
Aren't there any rules here?

327
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:01,383
He has only rules!
But never applies it!

328
00:24:01,553 --> 00:24:03,384
Did you take it like that?

329
00:24:03,555 --> 00:24:05,546
lf not followed, he'll rip out the skin.

330
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:08,215
ls he so great?
Call him out.

331
00:24:08,393 --> 00:24:11,055
What's this sir?
- You keep quiet.

332
00:24:11,396 --> 00:24:13,728
l'll hand over this boy to him.

lf you tell me where's Rajanna,

335
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:26,070
You get that boy to office.

Plants!

386
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:05,734
Why wouldn't students
commit suicide then?

387
00:27:06,238 --> 00:27:10,231
l don't mind even if it's ten days,
take my bags inside.

388
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:17,075
Donkeys must its job and

This looks like zoo not a hostel.

391
00:27:31,096 --> 00:27:35,430
You haven't yet seen much,

392
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,932
No use how much you may brush.

You said love is safe and

00:34:29,514 --> 00:34:34,178
Mock anger is beauty,

00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:43,024
Youthfulness is sweet...

Mischievous manliness has desired you...

509
00:35:19,397 --> 00:35:24,061
Heart fell for the young and handsome
and changed its attitude...

510

How did you steal my little heart?

511

00:35:43,254 --> 00:35:48,191
l'm on the verge of death...
- Shall l become the reason of it?

515
00:36:09,948 --> 00:36:14,612
Shall l drench you wet like
the mischievous rain drops?

516
00:36:14,786 --> 00:36:19,450
Shall l stop you with the
umbrella of my beauty?

517
00:36:19,624 --> 00:36:24,118
Youth is a hell and
desires are torturing me...

518
00:36:24,295 --> 00:36:28,959
l'm scared of this sweet ecstasy...

519
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:33,797
lt's a wound given by the youth...

520
00:36:52,657 --> 00:36:57,822
For me...
- For you only...

521
00:37:13,177 --> 00:37:14,007
One for me too!

522
00:37:14,178 --> 00:37:16,840
ls it any savoury prepared
by your mother to give?

523
00:37:33,197 --> 00:37:34,186
This is not mine, sir.

524
00:37:34,365 --> 00:37:36,697
Then whose?
- l don't need it, sir.

525
00:37:36,868 --> 00:37:39,769
l study well sir.
Please ask anyone here, sir.

526
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:43,204
Because of cheats like you,
such brilliant guys lose. Get out!

527
00:37:43,374 --> 00:37:45,103
Sir, he's telling truth.

528
00:37:45,543 --> 00:37:47,374
True?
- The bits are not his.

529
00:37:47,545 --> 00:37:48,705
Then whose?

530
00:37:49,047 --> 00:37:50,537
lf you don't tell me,
l'll book both of you for copying.

531
00:37:50,715 --> 00:37:52,376
Please tell him if you know, sister.

532
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:55,110
Tell me.
- lf not my life will get spoiled.

533
00:37:55,386 --> 00:37:56,546
Please tell him.

534
00:37:56,721 --> 00:37:57,779
Tell me quickly.

535
00:38:00,058 --> 00:38:01,389
They're PJ's!

536
00:38:02,226 --> 00:38:03,215
You sit down.

537
00:38:40,765 --> 00:38:42,756
lf some useless guy is more
important than me,

538
00:38:42,934 --> 00:38:44,265
don't talk to me.

539
00:38:45,269 --> 00:38:47,464
l trusted you and told my secrets.

540
00:38:50,608 --> 00:38:52,269
You made me a fool in public!

541
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:57,946
About the squad! Bribed them Rs.10000,
they saluted me and left.

542
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,474
But that student's life...

543
00:39:03,955 --> 00:39:07,288
His life is important, right?
Go to him. Go!

544
00:39:09,293 --> 00:39:11,955
l wanted to make you
my queen in few days,

545
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,791
but this is also good to me,

546
00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:16,630
l knew who you really are!

547
00:39:17,468 --> 00:39:19,459
l came to know the value
l must give you.

548
00:39:20,638 --> 00:39:25,473
l give more respect than my
grandpa's wealth to my ego!

549
00:39:25,643 --> 00:39:26,974
You hit me there!

550
00:39:28,646 --> 00:39:29,305
Come on boys!

551
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:46,323
No dear, please listen to me.
Forget him.

552
00:39:51,169 --> 00:39:53,000
NCC or NSS?

553
00:39:53,337 --> 00:39:57,671
You woke me up and
asking questions, you fool!

554
00:39:58,176 --> 00:40:01,668
All got up and are exercising,
you're sleeping like a lord.

555
00:40:01,846 --> 00:40:03,677
You want special invitation?
Get up and come to the ground.

556
00:40:03,848 --> 00:40:05,179
Come here.
- What?

557
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:07,180
ls that your money?
- Where?

558
00:40:09,353 --> 00:40:12,550
Come fast, buddy.
lf not no lunch.

559
00:40:13,524 --> 00:40:16,186
PJ! Your shoes are safe for today.

560
00:40:24,035 --> 00:40:27,198
That short is mine, will you take from
body also along with drying in sun?

561
00:40:27,371 --> 00:40:29,032
Which are yours and
which is mine, brother.

562
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:31,198
This is yours. Take it.
- Damn fool!

563
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:33,275
You'll watch fun if they remove
it in Bombay trains.

564
00:40:35,546 --> 00:40:37,207
What's this at midnight?

565
00:40:37,381 --> 00:40:39,372
Midnight? This is early morning 5 am.

566
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,542
First time l'm seeing this part of day.
- This part?

567
00:40:44,555 --> 00:40:48,719
You've to join NCC or NSS
to study in Govt. College.

568
00:40:48,893 --> 00:40:50,724
That's for people who have
to stay here and study.

569
00:40:50,895 --> 00:40:52,294
l'll manage it.

570
00:40:53,064 --> 00:40:54,156
l think it's difficult.

571
00:40:58,402 --> 00:41:00,393
This is Mangamma Govt. Degree College.

572
00:41:00,571 --> 00:41:03,404
A famous college from where great men
and scholars passed out.

573
00:41:03,574 --> 00:41:07,567
That's why l'm doing many degrees
here for the past 5 years.

574
00:41:07,745 --> 00:41:08,905
You stop that nonsense.
- l'll beat you.

575
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,913
Hindi master is coming.
Speak in Hindi.

576
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:14,244
l don't know to speak Hindi.
- Why tension?

577
00:41:14,418 --> 00:41:19,082
Hey Puranam Nagaraju!
Where did you go for two days?

578
00:41:19,257 --> 00:41:20,918
What? What did you say now?
Come again.

579
00:41:21,092 --> 00:41:23,253
Masterji, you...

580
00:41:23,761 --> 00:41:27,754
What's that? Say you!
- Listen.

581
00:41:27,932 --> 00:41:31,595
Hey Puranam Nagaraju!
Where did you go for two days?

582
00:41:32,603 --> 00:41:35,094
You fool! Say it again.

583
00:41:35,273 --> 00:41:36,604
What should you say for two days?

584
00:41:36,774 --> 00:41:39,766
Yesterday and one day past.

585
00:41:40,444 --> 00:41:41,775
You idiot!

586
00:41:41,946 --> 00:41:44,608
Are you speaking in English leaving
state language and mother tongue?

587
00:41:44,782 --> 00:41:47,444
You spiny haired Pulakesi!

588
00:41:47,618 --> 00:41:48,778
Yesterday and day before.

589
00:41:48,953 --> 00:41:50,944
Say it in Hindi.
- Cry it in Telugu.

590
00:41:51,122 --> 00:41:52,783
Cry has no language sir.

591
00:41:52,957 --> 00:41:54,117
Cry is some language.

592
00:41:54,292 --> 00:41:56,453
You'll beat if we don't
speak in Telugu,

593
00:41:56,627 --> 00:41:58,788
you'll beat if we don't
speak in Hindi,

594
00:41:58,963 --> 00:42:01,955
do one thing sir, you take
the Telugu version,

595
00:42:02,133 --> 00:42:03,794
and you take the Hindi version of it,

596
00:42:03,968 --> 00:42:05,299
and please leave us.

597
00:42:05,469 --> 00:42:06,959
All three of you cry in three languages.

598
00:42:07,138 --> 00:42:08,969
Grandpa! What's this fate!

599
00:42:09,807 --> 00:42:12,298
Thank God you're dead,
if not l would kill you now.

600
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,311
Why is he calling me now?

601
00:42:18,149 --> 00:42:18,979
Tell me.

602
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,983
To find about your welfare.
lt's a remote village...

603
00:42:22,153 --> 00:42:23,814
You don't worry,

604
00:42:23,988 --> 00:42:26,821
a lion will eat meat
only whether in forest or in zoo.

605
00:42:27,158 --> 00:42:29,149
You get ready to find yourself
a new job.

606
00:42:29,327 --> 00:42:32,660
Nothing is more peaceful than your
mouth shut and tonsured head.

607
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:33,819
That's the meaning of your life.

608
00:42:33,998 --> 00:42:35,989
You shut your gob!

609
00:42:37,001 --> 00:42:38,332
According to lndian Education system,

610
00:42:38,502 --> 00:42:40,834
if you complete degree in two years,
it's under graduate.

611
00:42:41,005 --> 00:42:42,165
Say it in Telugu.

612
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,173
Telugu? How can you do degree
in two years?

613
00:42:45,676 --> 00:42:47,507
l'll not study but buy it.

614
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,011
l've a big offer for you sir.

615
00:42:59,023 --> 00:43:02,186
lt's not good for you
if l study in this college.

616
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,691
l too don't have that much patience.

617
00:43:04,862 --> 00:43:06,329
But l need the certificate.

618
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:09,021
lf you tell me what you want...
- Tell me what it is?

619
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,690
l've met you somewhere.

620
00:43:13,204 --> 00:43:14,432
Oh military!

621
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:20,375
Now l got it.
- What? That l'm the principal.

622
00:43:20,544 --> 00:43:22,705
You're also a part of this match fixing.

623
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,443
So you knew the rules and
conditions of the will before hand.

624
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:31,051
l know it. No need of details.

625
00:43:31,222 --> 00:43:32,314
How much can you pay?

626
00:43:35,226 --> 00:43:36,386
lf you ask me how much...

627
00:43:37,895 --> 00:43:40,887
2% percent of my property,
it's too much,

628
00:43:41,065 --> 00:43:43,727
you can build two colleges
after your retirement.

629
00:43:43,901 --> 00:43:45,459
Don't hesitate.

630
00:43:46,237 --> 00:43:49,900
Rajanna, last year student Suri
is teasing girls,

631
00:43:50,074 --> 00:43:53,066
shall we cover him under blanket
and bash in college campus?

632
00:43:53,244 --> 00:43:55,075
Bash him.
- No need to beat him sir.

633
00:43:55,246 --> 00:43:56,577
Let's pour honey into his pant,

634
00:43:56,747 --> 00:44:00,410
if we tie him in the backyard
near the anthill,

635
00:44:00,584 --> 00:44:02,415
for one month he can't take a leak.

636
00:44:02,586 --> 00:44:04,076
Why is he talking like a criminal?

637
00:44:04,255 --> 00:44:06,246
lsn't it? Let's throw acid on him, sir.

638
00:44:06,424 --> 00:44:08,585
lt's lying waste in college lab.
- This is correct.

639
00:44:08,759 --> 00:44:10,590
ls this college or central jail?

640
00:44:10,761 --> 00:44:13,594
This is college, he's Praveen
Jayaramaraju l told you about.

641
00:44:13,764 --> 00:44:16,096
ls it him? We can reform him!

642
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:21,932
So, you've told them
everything about me.

643
00:44:22,106 --> 00:44:25,098
lt's big plan, this is match fixing.
- Yes fixing!

644
00:44:25,276 --> 00:44:29,269
We come to this profession after
fixing to change students like you.

645
00:44:29,447 --> 00:44:30,436
We'll change you!

646
00:44:31,115 --> 00:44:32,446
Sir, l...

647
00:44:33,951 --> 00:44:35,111
Your study in City College,

648
00:44:35,286 --> 00:44:36,947
and asking them to shove your
certificates somewhere,

649
00:44:37,121 --> 00:44:38,452
your wealth, the will,

650
00:44:38,622 --> 00:44:41,113
the condition that you'll not get
a pie without degree certificate,

651
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:42,281
we know everything.

652
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,291
All your ways are closed, PJ.

653
00:44:44,462 --> 00:44:49,456
The only help we can give is to take
into consideration your first year in city,

654
00:44:49,633 --> 00:44:51,624
and allowing you to sit in
the second year class,

655
00:44:51,802 --> 00:44:57,297
that exemption is given because
we can't tolerate you for 3 long years.

656
00:44:57,641 --> 00:45:00,132
ln 3 months first year supplementary
exams are scheduled,

657
00:45:00,311 --> 00:45:03,303
the twist in this is,
if you fail in that exam,

658
00:45:03,481 --> 00:45:06,314
according to the college rules,
you could be expelled.

659
00:45:06,484 --> 00:45:08,475
l'm giving you this bumper offer.

660
00:45:08,652 --> 00:45:10,813
You can leave if you don't
like the offer. Ready to go?

661
00:45:11,489 --> 00:45:14,322
l'll go.
- lt seems he'll go.

662
00:45:14,492 --> 00:45:16,824
To the class room!
You show me the way.

663
00:45:17,161 --> 00:45:18,992
Get up!
- Go to the back bench.

664
00:45:20,498 --> 00:45:23,160
Do you want the front bench?
- Have you become so proud?

665
00:45:23,334 --> 00:45:24,164
They'll go.

666
00:45:28,005 --> 00:45:30,838
Come brother! Please sit down.
My brother!

667
00:45:31,342 --> 00:45:33,173
Sister-in-law! Look there!

668
00:45:37,181 --> 00:45:38,341
This is your class room.

669
00:45:38,516 --> 00:45:40,347
l forgot my book, bring it. Go.

670
00:45:44,522 --> 00:45:46,183
Why is she here?

671
00:45:49,193 --> 00:45:50,182
What do you want?

672
00:45:52,696 --> 00:46:02,867
First time l saw you,
myriad of emotions hit my heart...

673
00:46:05,543 --> 00:46:08,205
She fell down again.
Get up!

674
00:46:08,379 --> 00:46:09,539
How many times will you fall down?

675
00:46:09,713 --> 00:46:12,045
Uddhandam sir is coming, silence please.

676
00:46:14,051 --> 00:46:16,884
Allasani Peddanna wrote 'Manu Charithra'.

677
00:46:17,054 --> 00:46:18,715
A great poem in it.

678
00:46:20,724 --> 00:46:22,282
He'll never reform.

679
00:46:24,728 --> 00:46:26,218
Yesterday you whistled
at Revathi, didn't you?

680
00:46:26,397 --> 00:46:30,561
Come on whistle at me now!
Bloody idiot!

681
00:46:30,734 --> 00:46:33,897
l'll kill you boy!

682
00:46:35,406 --> 00:46:36,737
Hole or dump?

683
00:46:36,907 --> 00:46:40,070
Even my husband dare not
touch me without my permission,

684
00:46:40,244 --> 00:46:42,735
how dare you touch me
and say chill!

685
00:46:42,913 --> 00:46:46,405
You don't know about me,
l'll take you to task.

686
00:46:47,251 --> 00:46:48,582
She generally washes clothes.

687
00:46:48,752 --> 00:46:50,913
lf anybody crosses her path,
she'll wash him clean.

688
00:46:51,088 --> 00:46:55,081
She's Rathamma!
- No psychopath!

689
00:47:05,336 --> 00:47:06,098
Who is that?

690
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:09,262
Why are you asking me?
l'm front, ask who is behind.

691
00:47:10,941 --> 00:47:13,102
lt's not me, Guruji.
- l know.

692
00:47:13,611 --> 00:47:15,772
Got saved!
- l didn't get him.

693
00:47:15,946 --> 00:47:20,610
When l do, l'll split him
into two halves!

694
00:47:20,784 --> 00:47:22,775
l'll teach him what a Guru is!

695
00:47:22,953 --> 00:47:26,116
God! Give me one opportunity!

696
00:47:28,792 --> 00:47:29,781
You?

697
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,120
When can l return this book again?

698
00:47:33,797 --> 00:47:37,460
You nasty idiot!
Stress on the last letter!

699
00:47:37,635 --> 00:47:39,967
You slapped me and then
troubling with tongue twisters.

700
00:47:41,138 --> 00:47:43,299
Say clearly again!

701
00:47:43,474 --> 00:47:44,805
How dare you beat a degree student!

702
00:47:45,142 --> 00:47:46,973
Stay put here,
l'll come back for you.

703
00:47:47,144 --> 00:47:48,975
Bloody bear faced!
- Bear...

704
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,471
God gave me the opportunity.

705
00:47:53,817 --> 00:47:55,148
For pronouncing the word again wrongly
he beat me again and again.

706
00:47:55,319 --> 00:47:56,308
Stop!

707
00:47:57,988 --> 00:48:00,320
He says again!
What's that?

708
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:05,656
No sir, it's again!
Marriage...sacred thread! Kali!- Stop!

709
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:08,662
Did you complain about me this guy?

710
00:48:08,832 --> 00:48:10,993
l taught him as well as his father.

711
00:48:11,168 --> 00:48:14,001
He's now in this position
because of my beatings.

712
00:48:14,171 --> 00:48:15,160
lsn't it?
- Yes master.

713
00:48:15,339 --> 00:48:17,170
You say now.
- Again?

714
00:48:18,342 --> 00:48:20,833
Sacred thread....eyes...

715
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:24,011
He's slapping me to death sir.
- Stop!

716
00:48:24,181 --> 00:48:26,513
Come to college tomorrow
in a dhoti,

717
00:48:26,684 --> 00:48:28,675
that's my punishment to you.
- Me?

718
00:48:28,852 --> 00:48:31,013
lsn't it?
You say now.

719
00:48:31,355 --> 00:48:33,414
Fruits...eyes...

720
00:48:34,191 --> 00:48:38,184
What you said means arrack?
You too come in a dhoti tomorrow. ldiot!

721
00:48:40,531 --> 00:48:42,192
Punishment to Rajanna himself!

722
00:49:01,719 --> 00:49:06,213
Oh no, l've lost all my money...

723
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:10,724
My purse is empty...

724
00:49:13,397 --> 00:49:15,888
Look like beggars batch near
Ameerpet signal.

725
00:49:17,901 --> 00:49:21,064
My credit card is not working...

726
00:49:23,907 --> 00:49:28,071
l've lost everything l had...
- Kajal come, l'm Bhairava.

727
00:49:28,245 --> 00:49:32,409
lt has come to an end,
matter has reached to a quarter...

728
00:49:32,583 --> 00:49:35,416
lt has taken the honour to the dogs...

729
00:49:35,586 --> 00:49:41,582
The man who devours pizzas and burgers
is given a finishing touch of chutney...

730
00:49:47,431 --> 00:49:50,264
Bloody gang of robbers!
Won't you let me sleep?

731
00:49:51,268 --> 00:49:54,260
All the characters are set,
have to find actors for two only.

732
00:49:54,438 --> 00:49:56,599
What to do?
- l want her to do the girl's character.

733
00:49:56,774 --> 00:49:57,763
No way, l'll not do.

734
00:49:57,941 --> 00:50:00,034
Who would suit the servant's character?

735
00:50:07,451 --> 00:50:10,113
My prince!

736
00:50:18,128 --> 00:50:19,288
What a great thing!

737
00:50:20,297 --> 00:50:23,630
What's your problem?
- No problem.

738
00:50:23,801 --> 00:50:27,293
We're staging a drama to raise
funds for flood affected victims.

739
00:50:27,471 --> 00:50:29,871
We're collecting donations for it.

740
00:50:31,975 --> 00:50:33,135
We don't want money, PJ.

741
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:36,802
There's character in it,
we think you're best suited for it.

742
00:50:37,147 --> 00:50:40,310
lf he does that character,
l'll do the lady's character.- What?

743
00:50:40,484 --> 00:50:42,475
A senior servant's character
in a big bungalow.

744
00:50:42,653 --> 00:50:44,814
Servant? Me?

745
00:50:44,988 --> 00:50:46,319
Yes, you!

746
00:50:46,657 --> 00:50:48,181
Apply make up to him.

747
00:50:54,832 --> 00:50:58,165
He looks like a real servant.
He's the servant.

748
00:50:59,336 --> 00:51:01,327
You're the best servant!

749
00:51:04,007 --> 00:51:06,669
Your face isn't rich unless
you wear costly clothes.

750
00:51:07,678 --> 00:51:09,839
How natural you look in
the servant's get up.

751
00:51:10,013 --> 00:51:11,173
To hell with you!

752
00:51:11,348 --> 00:51:15,341
You look perfect in servant's
dress than me.

753
00:51:20,023 --> 00:51:23,356
Not just one or two,
there are 42 toilets here, PJ!

754
00:51:23,527 --> 00:51:26,690
l'll be worried if it's less.

755
00:51:26,864 --> 00:51:28,525
Not in words, show your
prowess in action.

756
00:51:28,699 --> 00:51:30,530
You'll die on seeing the toilets.

757
00:51:30,701 --> 00:51:35,536
Don't send one at a time, send brush,
acid, phenol at a time.

758
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:37,529
Fool!

759
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:53,713
Shower baths and swimming pools
have become mirages...

760
00:51:53,891 --> 00:51:57,224
Got the stick!
- lt has taken him to task...

761
00:52:00,731 --> 00:52:05,566
The boy has come from
palace to toilet...

762
00:52:05,736 --> 00:52:08,398
ln one shot he has realised God...

763
00:52:08,572 --> 00:52:12,064
And made the boy squeal in pain...

764
00:52:12,242 --> 00:52:17,236
Easy life in AC bar has
come to an end...

765
00:52:17,414 --> 00:52:20,247
The end was quite bitter shock...

766
00:52:22,753 --> 00:52:24,914
The life of luxury is far away...

767
00:52:25,088 --> 00:52:30,082
His life is going from
bad to worse...

768
00:52:30,427 --> 00:52:32,418
With one shot he's dead on ground!

769
00:52:32,596 --> 00:52:34,757
40 toilets is not easy task,
even l couldn't do it.

770
00:52:34,932 --> 00:52:36,923
Shut up.
- He's damn tired.

771
00:52:37,434 --> 00:52:40,426
l'm not getting sleep,
please tell me a good story.

772
00:52:40,604 --> 00:52:42,595
l don't have the patience.
- Tell me.

773
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,432
Midnight...lt has four legs!
- Don't want that story. Tell me another.

774
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:48,100
lf another two falls...

775
00:52:48,278 --> 00:52:51,611
Okay, outside the village,
thick forest area,

776
00:52:51,782 --> 00:52:54,114
Abracadabra is walking alone,

777
00:52:56,119 --> 00:52:57,108
a big noise,

778
00:53:08,966 --> 00:53:10,627
Who is it? l'm Chandramukhi!

779
00:53:19,476 --> 00:53:22,468
l'm dead tired with body aches and
you're narrating a ghost story.

780
00:53:22,646 --> 00:53:25,308
Pulakesi! Come here.

781
00:53:26,483 --> 00:53:27,711
ls it good?

782
00:53:30,153 --> 00:53:32,314
Will you tell a ghost story?

783
00:53:35,325 --> 00:53:37,316
Last night they'd a fight in hostel.

784
00:53:49,172 --> 00:53:54,337
The bad time is laying
conditions to the lord...

785
00:53:54,511 --> 00:53:57,503
Fate mauled him badly...

786
00:53:57,681 --> 00:54:00,343
Handed over a broom to his hand...

787
00:54:00,517 --> 00:54:03,680
Dusted out his arrogance...

788
00:54:03,854 --> 00:54:09,019
The life that was roaming carefree
has turned into a bus stand...

789
00:54:09,192 --> 00:54:12,525
And made him toil like a donkey...

790
00:54:12,696 --> 00:54:16,689
Lost the royal luxurious life...

791
00:54:16,867 --> 00:54:21,702
Down with Rajanna fever...

792
00:54:21,872 --> 00:54:22,702
What happened?

793
00:54:22,873 --> 00:54:25,034
PT sir requested PJ.
- What?

794
00:54:27,377 --> 00:54:32,212
Any student studying here must
eitherjoin NCC or NSS!

795
00:54:33,216 --> 00:54:34,205
What have you decided?

796
00:54:34,384 --> 00:54:35,373
This is not like a request.

797
00:54:35,552 --> 00:54:38,043
According to lPC, the first one
is attempt to murder,

798
00:54:38,221 --> 00:54:40,052
and second is section 503!
Threatening!

799
00:54:40,223 --> 00:54:42,214
He says it's not a threat,
you keep quiet.

800
00:54:43,727 --> 00:54:45,217
How would l know which one is better?

801
00:54:45,395 --> 00:54:47,226
l waiting to ask you and decide.
- Shall l suggest?

802
00:54:47,898 --> 00:54:50,059
NSS mean traffic control,

803
00:54:50,233 --> 00:54:52,724
find lost children in festivals,
and cleaning their running noses,

804
00:54:52,903 --> 00:54:55,064
and helping the old to cross the road.

805
00:54:55,238 --> 00:54:56,728
l hate men or their sweat.

806
00:54:57,407 --> 00:55:02,401
NCC means morning walks, coffees,
tiffins, idlies, at times camps,

807
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:05,070
campfires and girls,
and spending time with them,

808
00:55:05,248 --> 00:55:07,079
it'll be different.

809
00:55:07,584 --> 00:55:08,744
Okay this one.

810
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,081
lt's nearer to my pub culture.

811
00:55:12,923 --> 00:55:13,582
Where's he?

812
00:55:16,593 --> 00:55:19,756
My committee decided that NCC
is best for me.

813
00:55:21,598 --> 00:55:22,428
Sir!

814
00:55:22,933 --> 00:55:24,423
Our new recruit.

815
00:55:25,268 --> 00:55:26,257
Original?

816
00:55:31,942 --> 00:55:33,432
Hail mother lndia!

817
00:55:40,784 --> 00:55:45,619
Life of fun and salsa dances
is over...

818
00:55:45,789 --> 00:55:48,622
Difficulties have taken
over the life...

819
00:55:48,792 --> 00:55:51,454
lt broke the legs of arrogance...

820
00:55:51,628 --> 00:55:55,120
And left the legs with sores...

821
00:55:55,298 --> 00:56:00,133
Unlucky has attacked, hauled
and mauled him...

822
00:56:00,303 --> 00:56:01,463
So what?

823
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:04,630
He was left with a begging bowl...

824
00:56:04,808 --> 00:56:08,471
And toil hard for a meal...

825
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:12,471
Bungalows and palaces have vanished...

826
00:56:12,649 --> 00:56:18,315
lt has left him with poverty
stricken life...

827
00:56:18,989 --> 00:56:20,149
Won't you please give me?

828
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:32,494
Run out?
- Stumped.

829
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:36,002
Egg? Serve me.

830
00:56:38,842 --> 00:56:40,673
No need to taste while eating.

831
00:56:40,844 --> 00:56:44,507
That's the lunch. Eat.
- Unjust! ls this pub culture?

832
00:56:44,681 --> 00:56:47,172
Will you make me go around
sixty times for a cheap upma?

833
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:49,341
l used to go in car to piss.

834
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:51,851
We can run when war starts,
why to run from now?

835
00:56:52,022 --> 00:56:52,852
Did you get a cashew in upma?

836
00:56:54,024 --> 00:56:55,355
ls there so much upma
to get a cashew?

837
00:56:55,525 --> 00:56:56,685
l got one.

838
00:57:02,532 --> 00:57:06,127
Run again?
l'll escape to NSS!

839
00:57:09,372 --> 00:57:12,034
lt seems you want to shift
from NCC to NSS.

840
00:57:13,376 --> 00:57:15,708
l felt helping a man directly is
better than learning to fire a rifle.

841
00:57:15,879 --> 00:57:25,880
People who are waiting for help,
to tell them l'm there for...

842
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:30,382
l want to help people.
l've decided.

843
00:57:31,728 --> 00:57:33,719
lt's good to help others.

844
00:57:33,897 --> 00:57:36,730
l'll introduce your group leader,
follow her instructions.

845
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:39,892
She is...
- Sindhu sir.

846
00:57:42,405 --> 00:57:44,066
Have you decided like that?
- Follow her.

847
00:57:44,241 --> 00:57:45,572
Me sir?

848
00:57:48,745 --> 00:57:51,407
NSS means...
- You needn't have to tell me, l know.

849
00:57:52,415 --> 00:57:53,404
Do you know everything?

850
00:57:54,084 --> 00:57:56,746
l thought you no nothing and wanted
to keep you uninformed for a month.

851
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,252
lf you know everything,
start helping the villagers.

852
00:57:59,422 --> 00:58:01,253
Help the...
- Villagers!

853
00:58:01,424 --> 00:58:02,413
God!

854
00:58:03,426 --> 00:58:04,586
Go man!

855
00:58:08,765 --> 00:58:09,925
Who are you standing on
road like a block?

856
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:11,761
Me?
- Yes you.

857
00:58:18,108 --> 00:58:19,769
How dare you stop me in my village!

858
00:58:19,943 --> 00:58:22,935
You'll get wet.
- No need, l'm wet already.

859
00:58:25,615 --> 00:58:26,775
Taking buffaloes on road.

860
00:58:27,117 --> 00:58:27,947
l'm talking to you.

861
00:58:29,953 --> 00:58:32,114
Got tired for this?

862
00:58:38,128 --> 00:58:40,221
What happened?

863
00:58:40,797 --> 00:58:43,129
My hand slipped and it entered inside.

864
00:58:43,633 --> 00:58:45,965
You've any problem?
Come, l'll console you.

865
00:58:47,137 --> 00:58:49,628
lt's stinking! Where's the tap?

866
00:58:58,315 --> 00:59:01,807
Didn't l tell you he can't work
and would be resting?

867
00:59:03,486 --> 00:59:06,978
How dare you sleep on duty!
20 marks less.

868
00:59:07,657 --> 00:59:08,817
Minus marks?

869
00:59:23,173 --> 00:59:25,004
l beat him, if you want suspend me.

870
00:59:25,175 --> 00:59:26,665
l'll take a week's rest.

871
00:59:26,843 --> 00:59:28,333
You've crossed that stage long back.

872
00:59:28,511 --> 00:59:30,502
Matter would've reached
Kannababu's father.

873
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:31,840
ls he such a great man?

874
00:59:32,015 --> 00:59:35,007
Any life is same to him,
whether it's fish or human.

875
00:59:36,519 --> 00:59:37,679
How dare he beat my son!

876
00:59:37,854 --> 00:59:39,515
Come on boys!

877
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:41,350
He's the one who beat him.

878
00:59:43,193 --> 00:59:44,353
Pick him up.

879
00:59:45,195 --> 00:59:46,184
Uncle...

880
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:48,691
This is injustice sir.

881
00:59:52,869 --> 00:59:53,699
Sit here.

882
00:59:55,038 --> 00:59:56,869
He's the guy who beat our boy.

883
00:59:58,208 --> 01:00:01,541
Did you beat my son?
Yes, l beat him.

884
01:00:01,711 --> 01:00:03,542
lf l beat him,
will you bring me here by force?

885
01:00:03,713 --> 01:00:05,203
lf you want hand me over to police.

886
01:00:05,548 --> 01:00:06,879
Why did you bring me here?

887
01:00:07,884 --> 01:00:10,717
lf you beat me,
l'll take you all to the court.

888
01:00:11,221 --> 01:00:13,121
l'm going.
- You stop!

889
01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:15,551
All of you go.

890
01:00:15,892 --> 01:00:18,053
Sop! l'm coming, make him sit there.

891
01:00:18,228 --> 01:00:20,219
Where can he go?
Sit down.

892
01:00:37,914 --> 01:00:41,077
Won't boys have a fight?

893
01:00:41,251 --> 01:00:43,913
Didn't we've fights as kids
with other boys and girls?

894
01:00:44,087 --> 01:00:47,250
Did you ask if they'd food?
- Take it.

895
01:00:48,425 --> 01:00:52,259
Your father went fishing
specially for you.

896
01:00:52,429 --> 01:00:55,592
My son loves fish curry.
- Okay, serve mother.

897
01:00:55,765 --> 01:00:58,757
Did you beat our son Kannababu?

898
01:00:58,935 --> 01:01:00,596
You did a good thing.

899
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:03,603
He's away in city for
5 years to study.

900
01:01:03,773 --> 01:01:05,434
He comes only once a year.

901
01:01:05,608 --> 01:01:08,099
l saw him because of you,
l don't mind if you beat him.

902
01:01:08,278 --> 01:01:11,270
Keep quiet, mother. He beat me only
once but you said many times.

903
01:01:11,448 --> 01:01:16,442
Beat him on face if you want to,
never hit on his stomach.

904
01:01:16,953 --> 01:01:21,447
He has some liver problem.
- l'll be fine.

905
01:01:24,627 --> 01:01:25,821
Aren't you angry on me?

906
01:01:26,463 --> 01:01:28,124
Didn't you get me to beat?

907
01:01:28,298 --> 01:01:31,790
Our son would've done some
mistake that's why you got angry.

908
01:01:32,969 --> 01:01:37,133
Before the wound on his face heals,
your anger must cool down.

909
01:01:37,307 --> 01:01:40,970
We're uneducated people,
we keep on fighting for revenge.

910
01:01:41,144 --> 01:01:44,807
You're educated, you mustn't
develop this vengeance feeling.

911
01:01:44,981 --> 01:01:46,141
So l did like this.

912
01:01:47,484 --> 01:01:51,648
Don't get angry on him
because he beat you.

913
01:01:51,821 --> 01:01:53,152
l don't have any hard
feelings, father.

914
01:01:53,323 --> 01:01:54,813
l've always liked him.

915
01:01:54,991 --> 01:01:57,482
Don't you like our food?

916
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:00,652
No, it's very good.
- Eat son!

917
01:02:01,831 --> 01:02:03,992
Wait son! Have some water.

918
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:08,501
When our son comes home
once a year,

919
01:02:08,671 --> 01:02:13,335
to feed him properly, we've to ask
neighbours to lend food grains,

920
01:02:13,843 --> 01:02:16,175
that's why he stays in hostel,

921
01:02:16,346 --> 01:02:19,179
he can have food there and
continue studies too,

922
01:02:19,349 --> 01:02:21,180
he's staying there for
the past 5 years,

923
01:02:21,851 --> 01:02:28,051
my son has never fought with
anyone in these 5 years,

924
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:33,693
don't fight with him son,
it may ruin his life.

925
01:02:34,197 --> 01:02:35,186
Bye son.

926
01:02:39,035 --> 01:02:40,525
Mother wants me to stay back here.

927
01:02:40,703 --> 01:02:42,193
This is for you to eat in hostel,

928
01:02:42,372 --> 01:02:46,206
this lantern if it gets dark
on the way. Go carefully.

929
01:02:46,376 --> 01:02:48,708
Sorry buddy.
- No formalities between us buddy.

930
01:02:51,047 --> 01:02:53,277
PJ, reach hostel before it's dark.

931
01:03:16,906 --> 01:03:17,736
Who is it?

932
01:03:35,091 --> 01:03:36,581
How did you fall down, PJ?

933
01:03:36,759 --> 01:03:39,250
l saw a ghost!
- Did you fall down in fear?

934
01:03:39,429 --> 01:03:42,421
l fell in trying to catch
the running ghost.

935
01:03:43,099 --> 01:03:45,932
l know you'll not believe me.

936
01:03:46,102 --> 01:03:48,263
Okay, take this tablet and
have tea, you'll be fine.

937
01:03:48,438 --> 01:03:52,772
l'll not take local tablets.
- Don't be so affectionate.

938
01:03:52,942 --> 01:03:56,275
Exams are 10 away and
he'll fail and leave this place.

939
01:03:56,446 --> 01:03:59,677
l'll definitely pass.
- He'll definitely pass!

940
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:07,954
l've decided...l must pass
this exam at any cost.

941
01:04:08,124 --> 01:04:11,287
You will surely!
- But how?

942
01:04:11,461 --> 01:04:14,453
How? A question that must be asked
by opposition is asked by treasury.

943
01:04:14,631 --> 01:04:16,462
You've passed the first year
in city, right PJ?

944
01:04:16,633 --> 01:04:18,123
l paid money to buy pass percentage.

945
01:04:18,301 --> 01:04:21,634
Paper?
- No, one who corrects papers.

946
01:04:21,804 --> 01:04:23,795
3 months are over,
l've not read anything.

947
01:04:23,973 --> 01:04:25,964
How am l to get through this?

948
01:04:28,811 --> 01:04:30,301
Roof is falling!

949
01:04:31,981 --> 01:04:33,972
Cells dying for long period in hot Sun,

950
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:36,812
shrink in rain,
and it creates fissures...

951
01:04:39,489 --> 01:04:42,322
l'll spend the night here to study.

952
01:04:42,492 --> 01:04:47,327
Kannababu will ensure a bigger
piece will fall on my hand.

953
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:49,320
lt'll hurt my hand.

954
01:04:49,499 --> 01:04:52,662
And l can't write the exam.
Someone else will take my exam...

955
01:04:55,171 --> 01:04:57,833
Kannababu will write and l'll pass.

956
01:04:58,007 --> 01:04:59,338
Everything will happen.

957
01:05:00,009 --> 01:05:01,738
Then you'll lose your hands.

958
01:05:03,179 --> 01:05:05,670
l think you don't have the
idea of timing.

959
01:05:05,848 --> 01:05:09,841
l'll keep my hand but remove
hands by the time it falls.

960
01:05:10,019 --> 01:05:11,281
That's timing!

961
01:05:16,025 --> 01:05:18,687
Will it fall again with
the same timing?

962
01:05:20,029 --> 01:05:23,021
Why again?
lt has fallen already.

963
01:05:26,869 --> 01:05:28,029
Prince!

964
01:05:30,206 --> 01:05:31,867
He thinks this is a plan.

965
01:05:33,209 --> 01:05:33,698
What?

966
01:05:33,876 --> 01:05:34,706
Look here sir.

967
01:05:35,044 --> 01:05:38,207
Your dilapidated college has
ruined my life and my hands.

968
01:05:38,381 --> 01:05:39,211
What happened?

969
01:05:39,382 --> 01:05:44,718
l studied very hard,
l had dreamed to pass,

970
01:05:45,221 --> 01:05:47,212
l can still see the lessons
before my eyes, sir,

971
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:49,381
but what's the use?
l must get justice.

972
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:52,050
lf not l'll launch a fast unto death.

973
01:05:52,228 --> 01:05:54,389
You mean you'll die without
eating food.

974
01:05:54,564 --> 01:05:56,054
You must tell me that before,
what do you call this as?

975
01:05:56,232 --> 01:05:57,893
Peaceful protest!
l'll protest peacefully.

976
01:05:58,067 --> 01:05:59,398
Cancel the earlier one.

977
01:06:00,570 --> 01:06:01,798
What are you planning to do?

978
01:06:02,405 --> 01:06:04,100
Someone else will take exam
on my behalf.

979
01:06:04,574 --> 01:06:08,066
But l'll narrate it.
lf not l'll protest.

980
01:06:08,244 --> 01:06:11,236
Who will write for you?
-l'll pass even if any fool writes.

981
01:06:11,414 --> 01:06:13,075
We?
- Not about you.

982
01:06:13,249 --> 01:06:14,580
Kannababu, you write this time.

983
01:06:14,751 --> 01:06:16,241
Okay.
- He'll write for me.

984
01:06:17,086 --> 01:06:19,748
l'll ask the committee and decide.
- Srikrishna Committee?

985
01:06:21,424 --> 01:06:23,085
Why are you poking me for long time?

986
01:06:23,259 --> 01:06:25,420
Some Sharatchandra wants to cry
with you only not with me.

987
01:06:25,595 --> 01:06:27,256
Keep it.
- Take it.

988
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:28,589
Bloody face!

989
01:06:28,765 --> 01:06:31,928
Hello Sharat! Conditions again?

990
01:06:32,101 --> 01:06:33,762
You guessed it right.
- What?

991
01:06:33,936 --> 01:06:40,102
Your grandpa ordered to open a cover
with conditions after 3 months in college.

992
01:06:40,276 --> 01:06:42,767
You didn't...
- l told you, you would've forgotten.

993
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:46,943
l know you're playing drama to
see l don't get the property.

994
01:06:47,116 --> 01:06:49,107
l'll kill you!

995
01:06:50,286 --> 01:06:53,119
You want me to tell or cut the line?
Tell me.

996
01:06:53,289 --> 01:06:55,450
What are the new conditions?
- l'm forgiving you this time.

997
01:06:55,625 --> 01:06:58,617
From today you mustn't beat
anyone in college.

998
01:06:58,795 --> 01:07:00,626
l'm not in a position anyway.

999
01:07:00,797 --> 01:07:01,627
Tell me what's the second condition?

1000
01:07:01,798 --> 01:07:06,963
You must become student's union
president in at least for a year.

1001
01:07:08,471 --> 01:07:14,307
Your nest is shattered...
your heart is broken...

1002
01:07:14,477 --> 01:07:21,474
O little bird, who beat you?

1003
01:07:21,651 --> 01:07:25,314
Committee discussed your request
and has agreed.

1004
01:07:25,988 --> 01:07:29,981
But we'll decide the man who will
take the exam on your behalf.- Who?

1005
01:07:34,831 --> 01:07:36,321
She'll write your exam.

1006
01:07:37,667 --> 01:07:40,830
She can sir.
- She will. She'll write the exam.

1007
01:07:46,843 --> 01:07:50,836
Becoming students union president,
Sindhu writing my exam,

1008
01:07:54,016 --> 01:07:56,177
keep that old man's photo
in my cell before me.

1009
01:08:01,357 --> 01:08:03,689
Grandpa! You've fixed me!

1010
01:08:05,027 --> 01:08:05,857
What's that?

1011
01:08:07,029 --> 01:08:09,691
That's interval!
l'll see after it.

1012
01:08:21,377 --> 01:08:24,210
Goddess mother, Praveen is writing
exam today, he's irresponsible,

1013
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:27,543
he can't do anything properly,
he can't write one word properly.

1014
01:08:27,717 --> 01:08:29,378
He doesn't know anything
other than drinks and girls.

1015
01:08:29,552 --> 01:08:30,541
He's a wastrel.

1016
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,211
He's an idiot,
he's very poor in studies...

1017
01:08:33,389 --> 01:08:35,880
We're not abusing him,
we're telling Goddess about him.

1018
01:08:36,058 --> 01:08:37,719
Goddess, please don't mind his words.

1019
01:08:38,728 --> 01:08:41,390
We were born and brought
up in poverty.

1020
01:08:41,564 --> 01:08:44,556
He was born with money,
he can't live without it.

1021
01:08:45,568 --> 01:08:49,231
Please change Sindhu's mind and
see that she writes exam for him.

1022
01:08:50,406 --> 01:08:51,896
Please don't let him write
the exam, Goddess.

1023
01:08:52,074 --> 01:08:53,905
lf he writes,
he'll not get even a pie.

1024
01:08:54,076 --> 01:08:56,237
We wish he passes this exam, Goddess.

1025
01:09:02,418 --> 01:09:03,908
What are you looking at?

1026
01:09:04,587 --> 01:09:07,579
l had spent few lakhs to know
some are not my friends.

1027
01:09:08,591 --> 01:09:10,582
l was thinking how you all
are different from them.

1028
01:09:10,927 --> 01:09:13,589
According to the...
- Telugu please.

1029
01:09:17,433 --> 01:09:20,766
You must pass.
- Pass.- Pass!

1030
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:25,600
You must win over this hurdle.

1031
01:09:40,456 --> 01:09:42,287
Looks like you're taking him
to sacrifice!

1032
01:09:42,458 --> 01:09:43,789
No sir, to write exam.

1033
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:45,951
Something like that only.

1034
01:09:46,128 --> 01:09:46,958
This year, let's rock it.

1035
01:09:50,967 --> 01:09:53,959
This side boy!
Examination hall is this side.

1036
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:57,303
He's a Ghazni Mohammad.
He has been attempting for years.

1037
01:10:05,815 --> 01:10:06,975
No slips, right?

1038
01:10:07,149 --> 01:10:08,810
With what? With this?

1039
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:14,984
Sindhu, this exam is my life's...

1040
01:10:15,825 --> 01:10:17,816
Do you know about Shakespeare's Hamlet?

1041
01:10:18,327 --> 01:10:20,488
l know about helmet and omelette.

1042
01:10:21,163 --> 01:10:22,824
You know or not?
- l don't know.

1043
01:10:24,166 --> 01:10:25,326
R K Narayanans?

1044
01:10:25,501 --> 01:10:27,833
l know about Nun who lives
next to Narayana's house.

1045
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:30,661
l mean old friend.
l don't know.

1046
01:10:32,842 --> 01:10:34,503
l know about Paradise biryani.

1047
01:10:35,011 --> 01:10:36,000
You...!

1048
01:10:36,178 --> 01:10:37,509
Why did you come to take exam then?

1049
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:45,678
l can live without anyone but
l can't live without luxuries of life.

1050
01:10:45,855 --> 01:10:48,847
l need money for all that.
lt's okay.

1051
01:10:50,359 --> 01:10:54,386
lf l want all that, you must help me.
You can't avoid it.

1052
01:10:55,364 --> 01:10:56,695
Are you writing all this?

1053
01:10:56,866 --> 01:10:59,357
lt's my duty to write
what ever you say.

1054
01:11:02,538 --> 01:11:04,529
lf l knew she was like this,
l wouldn't have had a fight with her.

1055
01:11:04,874 --> 01:11:06,364
Not you, turn that side.

1056
01:11:06,542 --> 01:11:07,702
l know sir.

1057
01:11:31,567 --> 01:11:32,397
Write!

1058
01:11:42,244 --> 01:11:43,905
Are the exams over?

1059
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:45,444
When?

1060
01:11:45,748 --> 01:11:48,740
When?! Go to and sleep.

1061
01:11:49,919 --> 01:11:51,011
Let's go, come.

1062
01:11:54,757 --> 01:11:57,248
What's the matter?
- Don't know.- Take it.

1063
01:11:57,593 --> 01:12:00,255
You didn't even offer upma too,
why are you giving sweets now?

1064
01:12:00,429 --> 01:12:02,420
Your time is nearing.

1065
01:12:02,598 --> 01:12:03,758
Our college's record.

1066
01:12:03,933 --> 01:12:06,424
You're the first student to
quit college in 3 months.

1067
01:12:06,602 --> 01:12:07,432
That's why they're distributing sweets.

1068
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:12,271
Results will be out today.

1069
01:12:12,942 --> 01:12:14,273
Why wait till the paper comes?

1070
01:12:14,777 --> 01:12:17,109
Get his luggage ready at the
door before paper comes..

1071
01:12:18,447 --> 01:12:20,108
Fail?
- Any doubt?

1072
01:12:20,449 --> 01:12:24,180
What happened? Your result is out
and birds have got wings...

1073
01:12:25,955 --> 01:12:27,445
Has Ramana come?

1074
01:12:32,128 --> 01:12:33,459
This is Ramana's cycle bell.

1075
01:12:38,634 --> 01:12:41,125
l can hear a strange
background music.

1076
01:12:41,303 --> 01:12:42,292
You too!

1077
01:12:49,311 --> 01:12:51,802
l feel you've passed seeing
his expression.

1078
01:12:51,981 --> 01:12:54,643
He's an Oscar winner and
his damn expression.

1079
01:12:56,152 --> 01:12:58,518
Sindhu has written the exam.
- But he told the answers.

1080
01:13:00,656 --> 01:13:03,648
Praveen, Rajanna is calling you.

1081
01:13:08,998 --> 01:13:13,162
Looking at his face it's confirmed,
get ready for consoling trip.

1082
01:13:13,335 --> 01:13:14,324
ls that the way you feel?

1083
01:13:14,503 --> 01:13:16,164
Keep quiet.
- What happened?

1084
01:13:16,338 --> 01:13:18,829
How could l pass, buddies?
- lt shouldn't happen.

1085
01:13:30,853 --> 01:13:31,842
Grandpa!

1086
01:13:37,026 --> 01:13:39,187
You're still PJ!
- l know.

1087
01:13:39,361 --> 01:13:41,522
Sindhu is responsible for this,
thank her.

1088
01:13:44,533 --> 01:13:46,524
Rajanna is next to her.

1089
01:13:47,369 --> 01:13:49,360
Why do you encourage
such cheap products?

1090
01:13:49,538 --> 01:13:50,869
They must be in dust bin.

1091
01:13:52,208 --> 01:13:53,368
l meant about Praveen.

1092
01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:55,699
l got it sir.

1093
01:13:55,878 --> 01:13:57,709
He'll rip your skin if he sees you.

1094
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:02,544
Teacher will bribe a kid with chocolate
first to get him into the school,

1095
01:14:02,718 --> 01:14:06,210
only then the teacher can know
what the child can learn, right?

1096
01:14:06,388 --> 01:14:10,381
lf you give just 3 months
and tell him to pass or fail,

1097
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:13,392
where's the time and
chance for him to reform?

1098
01:14:14,396 --> 01:14:18,730
lf PJ is really dull,
he'll fail in the next two years,

1099
01:14:19,235 --> 01:14:22,227
we needn't have to decide
about his place then, sir.

1100
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:25,571
We needn't have to decide.

1101
01:14:26,575 --> 01:14:27,405
Yes.

1102
01:14:29,411 --> 01:14:32,244
This is for you.
- What's this?

1103
01:14:33,082 --> 01:14:34,913
l don't have the habit of taking
anybody's help freely.

1104
01:14:35,084 --> 01:14:36,574
Will you take your grandpa's wealth?

1105
01:14:36,752 --> 01:14:37,582
That's mine, darling.

1106
01:14:37,753 --> 01:14:38,742
You still haven't yet got it.

1107
01:14:38,921 --> 01:14:41,583
Not your grandpa's,
get anything that you'd earned.

1108
01:14:41,757 --> 01:14:42,746
Why is he here?

1109
01:14:43,259 --> 01:14:45,250
Take it.
- Holding her hand, are you in love?

1110
01:14:45,427 --> 01:14:45,916
Love?

1111
01:14:46,095 --> 01:14:47,323
Sindhu, accept my love.

1112
01:14:47,496 --> 01:14:48,258
Should she accept your love?

1113
01:14:51,767 --> 01:14:53,928
Beat...beat him and forget
all the conditions.

1114
01:14:54,103 --> 01:14:55,934
Forget why you are here!

1115
01:14:56,105 --> 01:14:57,766
Behave always like this in your life.

1116
01:14:58,107 --> 01:15:00,598
No Sindhu...
- Don't talk Ammiraju.

1117
01:15:00,776 --> 01:15:02,107
She's right, don't talk Ammiraju.

1118
01:15:02,278 --> 01:15:05,111
l don't love anyone.
- She's doesn't love anyone.

1119
01:15:05,281 --> 01:15:08,614
l'm free. if you've patience,
try for another 6 months.

1120
01:15:08,784 --> 01:15:11,116
lf you've patience,
try for another 6 months.

1121
01:15:11,287 --> 01:15:13,619
l may fall.
- She may fall.

1122
01:15:14,123 --> 01:15:15,613
Fall? How can you fall for him?

1123
01:15:15,791 --> 01:15:16,621
Keep it with you.

1124
01:15:18,127 --> 01:15:19,788
Where's he?
Did you see my brother-in-law?

1125
01:15:19,962 --> 01:15:21,953
Seen any wine shop here?
- There!

1126
01:15:22,131 --> 01:15:25,794
Hey Mabbu, confused with dialogues,
let's rehearse once.

1127
01:15:25,968 --> 01:15:26,627
You remember your dialogues, right?

1128
01:15:26,802 --> 01:15:28,633
Okay...okay...l'm Yama!

1129
01:15:28,804 --> 01:15:31,637
Yama? You're Duryodhana!

1130
01:15:31,807 --> 01:15:34,640
You must say well said!
- Well said!

1131
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:36,801
Turn this side.
- l know.

1132
01:15:39,481 --> 01:15:43,315
When did you come, brother-in-law?

1133
01:15:43,485 --> 01:15:45,316
At quarter to nine,
quarter past nine.

1134
01:15:45,487 --> 01:15:49,480
Why is he here at this hour?
- He's drunk.

1135
01:15:49,658 --> 01:15:52,991
But still l'll go away.
- Are you escaping?

1136
01:15:53,162 --> 01:15:54,493
He's stinking!

1137
01:15:57,666 --> 01:15:59,827
What's this?
- Drama, play.

1138
01:16:01,837 --> 01:16:03,498
lt's who are you not how you are?

1139
01:16:05,841 --> 01:16:07,502
He looks like a crook, who is he?

1140
01:16:07,676 --> 01:16:08,665
l'm Krishna.

1141
01:16:09,511 --> 01:16:12,674
How many plays you've played?
- About 100 to 200!

1142
01:16:12,848 --> 01:16:16,011
100 or 200, there's 100
difference between them.

1143
01:16:16,185 --> 01:16:17,846
Take it 100 and odd.

1144
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:22,354
Krishna, select anyone
from the 4000 lovers.

1145
01:16:23,025 --> 01:16:25,687
Then l'll select this girl...

1146
01:16:25,861 --> 01:16:30,696
Duryodhana, he dared to touch Sindhu.

1147
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:34,533
Krishna, take off your crown.
- As you say.

1148
01:16:37,106 --> 01:16:40,542
Why?- Wear the crown now.
- l'll not.

1149
01:16:40,709 --> 01:16:43,872
Krishna, you're not Lord Krishna now.

1150
01:16:44,046 --> 01:16:46,708
Sindhu.
- Tell me, PJ brother-in-law.

1151
01:16:47,383 --> 01:16:53,117
Sindhu, if he has patience
can Ammiraju try you?

1152
01:16:55,224 --> 01:16:59,217
You mustn't beat anyone.
- That's why l'm not beating her.

1153
01:16:59,395 --> 01:17:02,387
Why me?- What's this?
- Drama!

1154
01:17:02,564 --> 01:17:03,553
Well said!

1155
01:17:03,732 --> 01:17:06,064
Did l voluntarily trap myself?

1156
01:17:06,235 --> 01:17:08,226
Who else do l've other
than you, Sindhu?

1157
01:17:08,404 --> 01:17:11,737
PJ brother-in-law.
l don't like this character.

1158
01:17:11,907 --> 01:17:13,738
Give me another character,
l'll rock with my performance.

1159
01:17:13,909 --> 01:17:17,242
Select one finger among the three.

1160
01:17:17,413 --> 01:17:20,246
No girls in it, right?
But still l'll select one.

1161
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:23,411
There's no danger in
his character, right?

1162
01:17:23,752 --> 01:17:25,913
Do you want Sindhu?

1163
01:17:26,088 --> 01:17:27,077
Why are you asking me
all the questions?

1164
01:17:27,256 --> 01:17:28,917
He has played 100 dramas,
won't you ask him?

1165
01:17:29,091 --> 01:17:31,252
You're drunk, don't come to me.

1166
01:17:34,930 --> 01:17:38,263
Select one of these two fingers.

1167
01:17:38,434 --> 01:17:40,265
You'll beat me even if l select, right?

1168
01:17:42,104 --> 01:17:43,435
l'll beat you, even if you don't select.

1169
01:17:43,605 --> 01:17:44,936
Beat me lightly.

1170
01:17:46,942 --> 01:17:48,933
You've respect for Rajanna, right?

1171
01:17:49,611 --> 01:17:50,771
That's for outside world only.

1172
01:17:50,946 --> 01:17:52,937
What's this?
- Drama.

1173
01:17:54,616 --> 01:17:57,949
You and that lawyer tried to
usurp my wealth, right?

1174
01:18:01,623 --> 01:18:03,955
l selected the other finger
in confusion.

1175
01:18:05,961 --> 01:18:06,950
Who is this?

1176
01:18:07,963 --> 01:18:11,126
l don't know this character,
l can't play this.

1177
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:13,127
l know.

1178
01:18:24,646 --> 01:18:27,479
He has gone out.
Saved from a danger.

1179
01:18:32,488 --> 01:18:34,820
Will you lay conditions, Sharat?

1180
01:18:36,658 --> 01:18:38,148
l'll resign.

1181
01:18:38,327 --> 01:18:41,819
You said over 100,
can't do even 4 also?

1182
01:18:43,665 --> 01:18:46,828
Stop! lt's wrong to get drunk
and create trouble.

1183
01:18:47,169 --> 01:18:49,660
When did you come, brother-in-law?
- Just now, come.

1184
01:18:50,839 --> 01:18:51,999
Who broke those benches?
Did l do it?

1185
01:18:52,341 --> 01:18:54,571
Those were like this only,
come let's go to the room.

1186
01:19:08,690 --> 01:19:10,021
Sir, l passed the exam.

1187
01:19:10,192 --> 01:19:12,183
Sometimes such mistakes
do happen, go to your seat.

1188
01:19:12,361 --> 01:19:14,192
Bell has been rung, you go.

1189
01:19:14,363 --> 01:19:17,594
Those who don't want will leave.
- He thinks l'll leave.

1190
01:19:18,867 --> 01:19:20,858
People think Telugu will die.

1191
01:19:21,036 --> 01:19:25,370
lf that happens, not me where would
these Telugu teachers go?

1192
01:19:31,713 --> 01:19:36,377
lf the situation makes Telugu to die,
l'll die a day before that happens.

1193
01:19:38,053 --> 01:19:41,216
Our neighbouring state's people
are dying for their language,

1194
01:19:41,390 --> 01:19:43,620
and you wish Telugu to die.

1195
01:19:44,726 --> 01:19:48,560
Telugu isn't getting those 35
marks with great difficulty,

1196
01:19:48,730 --> 01:19:52,894
it's bridge to share ourjoys
and grieves with our mother,

1197
01:19:53,068 --> 01:19:56,902
when you get hurt, you cry shit,

1198
01:19:57,072 --> 01:19:59,063
how can you understand
the greatness of Telugu?

1199
01:20:00,409 --> 01:20:03,572
l'm not here to give
a lecture to you,
l'm here to teach you lessons,

1200
01:20:03,745 --> 01:20:07,909
Write Viswaksena's son is
Taskaskambotlu!

1201
01:20:09,084 --> 01:20:09,573
Tas...

1202
01:20:09,751 --> 01:20:12,242
Write Viswaksena's son is
Taskaskambotlu!

1203
01:20:12,421 --> 01:20:14,252

01:20:14,423 --> 01:20:15,913
l mean 1000 times. Write.

1205
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:21,923
That PJ...
- No need to details to Adivi Rambabu.

1206
01:20:22,097 --> 01:20:23,587
Just show him to me.

1207
01:20:24,099 --> 01:20:25,760
He's Adivi's man.
- l know.

1208
01:20:25,934 --> 01:20:27,424
How?
- He's Adivi's(forest) man!

1209
01:20:28,103 --> 01:20:30,594
Not like that, l'm Adivi
and he's my man.

1210
01:20:30,772 --> 01:20:33,434
He's Adivi Rambabu's man!
- What's the problem?

1211
01:20:33,609 --> 01:20:35,770
You love that girl,
my man will leave her.

1212
01:20:36,945 --> 01:20:39,607
You leave that girl,
my man will love her.

1213
01:20:39,781 --> 01:20:42,944
Your man must leave the girl he loves,
how can l leave her?- What?

1214
01:20:43,118 --> 01:20:46,610
Look, you must divorce your wife,
how can he divorce her?

1215
01:20:46,788 --> 01:20:48,619
You're right.
- lsn't it? Leave it.

1216
01:20:48,790 --> 01:20:51,122
l'll leave it.
Then, my man?

1217
01:20:51,293 --> 01:20:52,783
He'll leave the girl.
- Then you?

1218
01:20:52,961 --> 01:20:54,121
l'll love the girl.

1219
01:20:54,463 --> 01:20:56,988
What's the problem?
lt's settled. Let's go.

1220
01:20:57,799 --> 01:20:59,289
Will you get confused
if l confuse you?

1221
01:20:59,468 --> 01:21:00,958
Bloody red shirt...

1222
01:21:01,136 --> 01:21:03,969
This is black shirt.

1223
01:21:04,139 --> 01:21:06,972
Red will suit you better, boy.
- Boy?

1224
01:21:07,142 --> 01:21:09,804
l'm Tiger to this place,
are you calling me a boy?

1225
01:21:09,978 --> 01:21:11,468
What's that look?

1226
01:21:12,814 --> 01:21:17,308
l mustn't beat anyone, boy.
- l've carried stones!

1227
01:21:17,486 --> 01:21:19,317
You can't understand the lock
in the screenplay,

1228
01:21:19,488 --> 01:21:22,821
l shouldn't beat anyone.
- What should l understand?
Come on!

1229
01:21:25,494 --> 01:21:26,984
What's the price of pumpkin?
- Rs.50!

1230
01:21:27,162 --> 01:21:29,494
Rs.50?!
Give me for Rs.20!

1231
01:21:29,665 --> 01:21:31,326
Boy, give me the bat.

1232
01:21:31,833 --> 01:21:33,164
Will you play cricket now?

1233
01:21:33,835 --> 01:21:35,325
l can't play.
l know to play.

1234
01:21:35,504 --> 01:21:37,028
Boy, ball please.

1235
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:39,329
Why?

1236
01:21:39,508 --> 01:21:41,999
Rathamma!
- Rathamma?

1237
01:21:42,177 --> 01:21:44,168
Why will you not give?
- Super boy!

1238
01:21:48,016 --> 01:21:51,179
Who is that? Bloody idiots!

1239
01:21:51,353 --> 01:21:52,513
Wait, l'll take you to task.

1240
01:21:52,688 --> 01:21:56,419
Am l looking so cheap to you?
You're dead today!

1241
01:21:56,858 --> 01:21:58,018
Stop there!

1242
01:21:58,193 --> 01:22:02,027
Will you beat me with ball,
you damn fool?

1243
01:22:02,364 --> 01:22:04,525
Why are you getting involved
in love and fights?

1244
01:22:05,033 --> 01:22:06,022
Forget this.

1245
01:22:06,201 --> 01:22:10,035
l've a good plan for you to become the
college president. Just follow it.

1246
01:22:10,205 --> 01:22:12,196
Tell me sir.

1247
01:22:12,374 --> 01:22:14,706
Not now.
- When?

1248
01:22:14,876 --> 01:22:16,537
Tonight.
- Where?

1249
01:22:17,546 --> 01:22:19,537
Temple?
- Near Wines.

1250
01:22:23,552 --> 01:22:26,885
3 quarters have gone down but
matter hasn't come out yet.

1251
01:22:27,055 --> 01:22:29,888
Even 3 more quarters go down,
this is the matter.

1252
01:22:30,559 --> 01:22:31,218
Liquor?

1253
01:22:32,394 --> 01:22:37,730
Find a good occasion and give
everyone a liquor bottle and Rs.500,

1254
01:22:37,899 --> 01:22:40,561
you'll get all the votes.
- Sindhu is the opponent.

1255
01:22:40,736 --> 01:22:42,067
To hell with Sindhu.

1256
01:22:42,237 --> 01:22:44,068
She can't distribute to
so many people.

1257
01:22:44,573 --> 01:22:47,906
But half of the college are girls,
what would they do with bottles?

1258
01:22:48,076 --> 01:22:50,567
They'll give to their father
or boy friend.

1259
01:22:55,083 --> 01:22:56,107
Will it work out?

1260
01:22:57,252 --> 01:23:01,086
60 percent of democracy works
on this principle,

1261
01:23:01,256 --> 01:23:04,248
do you've money,
l've a plan for that too.

1262
01:23:04,593 --> 01:23:06,254
No need.
- Where's my drink?

1263
01:23:06,428 --> 01:23:08,589
We need his vote also.
01 23 Distribution started.

1264
01:23:08,764 --> 01:23:10,755
Our votes are yours,
what an idea sir!

1265
01:23:10,932 --> 01:23:15,266
Madam, please give me alms.
Madam, God will bless you.

1266
01:23:16,938 --> 01:23:18,269
Why hasn't come yet?

1267
01:23:20,275 --> 01:23:22,436
Will you give me Rs.5, l'll have a tea.

1268
01:23:22,611 --> 01:23:23,771
Will you have tea for Rs.5?

1269
01:23:23,945 --> 01:23:26,436
l'll give you Rs.25, have a pesticide!
Get lost!

1270
01:23:32,454 --> 01:23:33,284
Why are you so late?

1271
01:23:33,955 --> 01:23:35,286
Did you miss city life?

1272
01:23:35,457 --> 01:23:39,291
New friends, fresh air.
l'm enjoying to the hilt.

1273
01:23:39,461 --> 01:23:40,450
Where's your car?

1274
01:23:40,629 --> 01:23:46,397
Car...village roads are not
that comfortable, so... l came on bike.

1275
01:23:46,968 --> 01:23:48,959
This one?
- Mine.- Take off your hand.

1276
01:23:50,472 --> 01:23:55,307
My friend...he's going out with
family, you can return it later.

1277
01:23:56,645 --> 01:24:00,308
Actual matter is l must win
the student election.

1278
01:24:01,316 --> 01:24:06,151
lf l lose, then l've to beg all my life.
- Like me?

1279
01:24:06,321 --> 01:24:08,812
You come here.
- He's a pain!

1280
01:24:11,326 --> 01:24:12,657
l'll kill him.

1281
01:24:13,495 --> 01:24:15,986
l want minimum Rs.5 lakhs.
Did you bring t?

1282
01:24:17,332 --> 01:24:18,993
l've to distribute today evening.

1283
01:24:19,501 --> 01:24:24,336
Wearing a long skirt and half sari...
Sporting flowers in the tresses...

1284
01:24:24,506 --> 01:24:30,672
Swan necked Shyamala...
- ls here for us only...

1285
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:33,341
She's dancing for us...

1286
01:24:38,353 --> 01:24:41,015
ls it? Shall l say something now?

1287
01:24:46,361 --> 01:24:49,194
l don't understand what you're
saying brothers-in-law...

1288
01:24:49,364 --> 01:24:51,696
But still greetings to all art lovers...

1289
01:24:51,867 --> 01:24:53,198
Okay, come to the point...

1290
01:24:53,368 --> 01:24:55,700
The colourful top...
Golden rings...

1291
01:24:55,871 --> 01:24:59,363
ls here seeking votes,
that's the matter...

1292
01:25:04,713 --> 01:25:07,375
Our votes are for Munna only...

1293
01:25:07,549 --> 01:25:10,882
l'll give a rung for every vote
cast for him...

1294
01:25:11,052 --> 01:25:13,543
By evening the counting will start...

1295
01:25:13,722 --> 01:25:16,555
He'll show you the code...

1296
01:25:16,725 --> 01:25:19,558
See your booth and
vote for the balloon...

1297
01:25:19,728 --> 01:25:23,391
Rock with your vote...

1298
01:25:23,565 --> 01:25:35,067
O Shyamala, we'll vote for him...

1299
01:25:48,089 --> 01:25:50,580
Fast beat man!
- Fast beat?

1300
01:25:50,759 --> 01:25:52,920
You mean?
- That beat!

1301
01:26:11,112 --> 01:26:16,948
l was waiting in a bus stop and
saw Lord and fell for him...

1302
01:26:17,118 --> 01:26:22,954
l gave up Bangena King's
dance program for him...

1303
01:26:23,124 --> 01:26:28,790
Coming here l find so many...
l must do something for you...

1304
01:26:28,964 --> 01:26:31,797
Balloon is your only hope
of the future...

1305
01:26:31,967 --> 01:26:34,629
l knew this and have asked you...

1306
01:26:34,803 --> 01:26:37,966
Remember the symbol
and vote for balloon...

1307
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:08,992
Beat the rhythm of Seema!
- That one!

1308
01:27:09,337 --> 01:27:11,168
Take out the blades!

1309
01:27:26,855 --> 01:27:28,846
Why don't you tell what would
you on getting elected?

1310
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:34,690
lf l win the election,
l'll provide FTV in classrooms...

1311
01:27:35,030 --> 01:27:41,026
lf you get caught with love letter,
l'll argue it's a leave letter...

1312
01:27:41,202 --> 01:27:43,864
l'll remove 'Rakhi' from festivals...

1313
01:27:44,039 --> 01:27:46,872
l'll add a wine shop to
college canteen...

1314
01:27:47,042 --> 01:27:52,878
He's our leader...
no doubt you're a leader...

1315
01:27:53,048 --> 01:27:56,040
Remember the symbol
and vote for balloon...

1316
01:28:33,254 --> 01:28:34,585
Oh no Rajanna!

1317
01:28:47,102 --> 01:28:51,266
For trying to win elections in this way,
l'm disqualifying you,

1318
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:55,933
and requesting the committee
to elect Sindhu unanimously.- No sir...

1319
01:29:06,955 --> 01:29:12,291
How can l bear if people talk
bad about you from tomorrow?

1320
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:15,293
Men can never understand a woman.

1321
01:29:15,797 --> 01:29:16,786
Never!

1322
01:29:20,135 --> 01:29:21,796
Why should l understand her heart?

1323
01:29:26,307 --> 01:29:27,205
Where are you going?

1324
01:29:29,644 --> 01:29:30,804
Take it easy.

1325
01:29:31,312 --> 01:29:32,301
We're going.

1326
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:35,643
PJ spent Rs.5 lakhs and
made Sindhu win easily.

1327
01:29:40,989 --> 01:29:43,480
Keep PJ's and throw out all
other student's things.- Okay.

1328
01:29:58,339 --> 01:29:59,328
Get going!

1329
01:30:00,675 --> 01:30:03,337
Rajanna, we don't have anything
to eat in home.

1330
01:30:03,511 --> 01:30:05,172
Please don't ask me to leave.

1331
01:30:05,513 --> 01:30:08,676
We're sorry sir, if my father
comes to know, he'll kill me.

1332
01:30:08,850 --> 01:30:10,681
Please forgive us one last time, sir.

1333
01:30:11,352 --> 01:30:13,843
We've come this far unable
to live there,

1334
01:30:14,022 --> 01:30:17,856
we don't have money
to go home too. We'll not go.

1335
01:30:18,026 --> 01:30:20,017
PJ committed the mistake,
why are you asking us to leave?

1336
01:30:20,195 --> 01:30:22,356
What was his mistake?
He's a useless wastrel!

1337
01:30:22,530 --> 01:30:24,521
He did what l thought he would do.

1338
01:30:24,866 --> 01:30:27,562
l was correct in judging him.
l don't have any regrets.

1339
01:30:28,203 --> 01:30:30,194
But l trusted you all.

1340
01:30:30,705 --> 01:30:32,366
You've made me bow
my head in shame.

1341
01:30:33,041 --> 01:30:34,030
You keep quiet.

1342
01:30:37,045 --> 01:30:39,707
Please go away, go!
- We'll not go sir.

1343
01:30:40,381 --> 01:30:43,714
Don't say like that Rajanna,
thought we were doing for a friend,

1344
01:30:43,885 --> 01:30:45,546
now after seeing tears in your eyes,
we've understood,

1345
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:46,709
what a grave mistake we've committed!

1346
01:30:46,888 --> 01:30:51,052
Sir, let anyone say anything,
we'll behave like your students.

1347
01:30:51,226 --> 01:30:52,557
We'll not change.

1348
01:30:52,727 --> 01:30:55,890
l love my father,
l swear on my father, sir.

1349
01:30:56,064 --> 01:30:58,396
Wrong, don't swear on him.

1350
01:31:00,068 --> 01:31:03,060
Just one dirty slush ditch is enough
to spoil a team of achievers.

1351
01:31:05,073 --> 01:31:10,409
lf l see you again with him,
don't dare come before me.

1352
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:14,571
Go, eat something and
go to sleep.

1353
01:31:25,093 --> 01:31:27,425
Get up...get up...

1354
01:32:03,965 --> 01:32:08,299
Looking at the bright Brahmin boy,
it seems so said the people...

1355
01:32:08,469 --> 01:32:11,632
Hey Kannababu! Where's your director?

1356
01:32:11,806 --> 01:32:16,971
Arrogant, wager, drunkard,
useless, man without any talent.

1357
01:32:17,145 --> 01:32:19,136
How can he dare come to the class?

1358
01:32:21,816 --> 01:32:23,647
He would've got drunk
and fallen somewhere.

1359
01:32:23,818 --> 01:32:25,308
lt seems so said the people...

1360
01:32:31,826 --> 01:32:32,815
Hey boy!

1361
01:32:34,162 --> 01:32:35,493
Come here!

1362
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:36,660
What?

1363
01:32:36,831 --> 01:32:39,994
Please don't call him.
- l'm talking to him, right? Shut up.

1364
01:32:41,502 --> 01:32:42,833
Come here.

1365
01:32:49,177 --> 01:32:50,166
Come.

1366
01:32:50,511 --> 01:32:56,507
No! As a girl...
- School is closed for rain,

1367
01:32:56,684 --> 01:32:58,675
can you take us home without
our books getting wet?

1368
01:32:58,853 --> 01:33:01,083
Don't do it for free,
tell us how much you want?

1369
01:33:02,357 --> 01:33:04,018
No need, come.

1370
01:33:09,864 --> 01:33:12,526
He's smiling at you.
- No problem.

1371
01:33:14,035 --> 01:33:17,198
Warden will scold if she sees him.
- l'll manage.

1372
01:33:18,873 --> 01:33:20,033
Shut up!

1373
01:33:27,548 --> 01:33:29,880
Let's meet again, please stay here.

1374
01:33:33,888 --> 01:33:35,048
Come quickly!

1375
01:33:40,728 --> 01:33:44,721
Praveen, don't get wet in rain.
Come in.

1376
01:33:46,234 --> 01:33:49,397
Mother!
- Come in son!

1377
01:33:49,904 --> 01:33:52,896
Please listen to me, son.
Come in.

1378
01:33:53,074 --> 01:33:55,065
Don't get wet in rain,
you'll catch cold.

1379
01:33:55,243 --> 01:33:55,732
Come in quickly son.

1380
01:34:02,917 --> 01:34:06,080
Don't get wet, you'll catch cold, son.

1381
01:34:06,254 --> 01:34:08,085
Don't get wet in rain.

1382
01:34:14,595 --> 01:34:16,756
Father, l'll go out to play.
- Stop!

1383
01:34:16,931 --> 01:34:17,920
l'll go out, please tell him, mother.

1384
01:34:18,099 --> 01:34:21,432
How many times l've told you
not to be mischievous?

1385
01:34:21,936 --> 01:34:23,096
This many times!

1386
01:34:23,271 --> 01:34:25,262
Grandpa doesn't like being mischievous.

1387
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:28,273
l did a mischievous thing and
grandpa threw me out of home.

1388
01:34:28,443 --> 01:34:29,933
ls marrying me a mischievous thing?

1389
01:34:30,111 --> 01:34:31,442
Keep quiet, Gayathri.

1390
01:34:31,612 --> 01:34:33,944
We've got a message from
grandpa after many years.

1391
01:34:34,115 --> 01:34:37,107
You mustn't do any
mischief there, son.- Okay father.

1392
01:34:37,618 --> 01:34:42,112
Praveen, you must be a good man
like your grandpa and father.

1393
01:34:42,290 --> 01:34:43,279
Okay mother.

1394
01:34:45,293 --> 01:34:49,787
lt was major accident, heavy blood loss.
Difficult to survive.

1395
01:35:18,159 --> 01:35:21,322
Are you leaving PJ?
Rajanna gave this box to you.

1396
01:35:22,997 --> 01:35:23,827
What's this?

1397
01:35:25,333 --> 01:35:26,664
Okay, bye.

1398
01:35:46,854 --> 01:35:52,019
My dear Praveen, l may not live
when you're 18,

1399
01:35:52,193 --> 01:35:56,357
your father came to study in this
college leaving kingdom and wealth,

1400
01:35:57,532 --> 01:36:01,195
life, friends who give real happiness
and good men,

1401
01:36:01,369 --> 01:36:02,859
he said he met here only,

1402
01:36:03,037 --> 01:36:07,701
leaving me among the hypocrites
and false men,

1403
01:36:07,875 --> 01:36:08,864
he stayed back here only.

1404
01:36:09,043 --> 01:36:11,876
Your mother met your
father here only.

1405
01:36:12,046 --> 01:36:14,879
They married against my wish.

1406
01:36:15,049 --> 01:36:20,043
That's why l threw him out of home
and tried to take revenge on him.

1407
01:36:20,221 --> 01:36:22,382
By the time my temper cooled down
and good sense prevailed,

1408
01:36:22,557 --> 01:36:25,048
God took them away from me,

1409
01:36:26,227 --> 01:36:28,718
to correct the mistake l did,

1410
01:36:29,063 --> 01:36:33,898
l wished you to study in the same
college where your father studied,

1411
01:36:34,068 --> 01:36:39,233
l wanted to you to get the same life and
experience which your father got here,

1412
01:36:39,407 --> 01:36:45,403
to run well our kingdom and
factories that supports 40000 people,

1413
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:50,916
l thought it was correct on my part to
make you a leader of 400 students,

1414
01:36:51,085 --> 01:36:56,580
that's why l insisted you must
become students union president,

1415
01:36:57,258 --> 01:37:04,426
my wish is you must get the happiness
and live fully what l had missed.

1416
01:37:04,599 --> 01:37:05,964
yours lovingly grandpa.

1417
01:37:35,296 --> 01:37:36,627
Call me as uncle!

1418
01:37:41,969 --> 01:37:44,460
Why didn't you tell me sir?
- What am l to tell you?

1419
01:37:45,306 --> 01:37:48,798
You're just a kid compared to
your father's stubbornness.

1420
01:37:49,477 --> 01:37:52,810
When were studying together,
it took me an year to understand him,

1421
01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:54,709
you're here for three months only,

1422
01:37:54,815 --> 01:37:57,010
neither you nor your father
don't listen to words,

1423
01:37:59,153 --> 01:38:02,145
calm down boy!

1424
01:38:02,490 --> 01:38:03,980
Don't cry. What's this?

1425
01:38:04,158 --> 01:38:06,490
l'll go away, uncle.
- Where?

1426
01:38:06,994 --> 01:38:08,484
To some place.

1427
01:38:08,663 --> 01:38:11,996
l'm feeling guilt, uncle,
l fear losing.

1428
01:38:15,169 --> 01:38:16,329
Mad boy!

1429
01:38:16,504 --> 01:38:17,664
What's in victory?

1430
01:38:17,838 --> 01:38:20,329
lt may introduce you to the world.

1431
01:38:20,508 --> 01:38:22,032
Lose once!

1432
01:38:23,511 --> 01:38:25,502
You'll understand the world!

1433
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:30,344
Go, stop thinking and go to sleep.
Let's discuss tomorrow.

1434
01:38:32,186 --> 01:38:33,016
Go!

1435
01:38:50,871 --> 01:38:54,864
Are you swimming, Ammiraju?
- No, just working.

1436
01:38:57,044 --> 01:39:00,707
Are you arranging dance
program in village festival?

1437
01:39:00,881 --> 01:39:03,372
We've to, do you know any dancer?

1438
01:39:03,551 --> 01:39:06,884
We're ignorant, look there,
a man is coming!

1439
01:39:07,221 --> 01:39:10,384
He arranged the dance program
in Mangamma college. Ask him.

1440
01:39:10,558 --> 01:39:13,049
Will you arrange a program for us too?

1441
01:39:13,894 --> 01:39:16,556
ls it college or a Harlem?

1442
01:39:16,731 --> 01:39:18,221
You've come from outside and
spoiling the reputation of this village.

1443
01:39:18,399 --> 01:39:19,889
Bloody idiot! May you get ruined!

1444
01:39:20,067 --> 01:39:21,728
Arrange a dance program again.

1445
01:39:23,237 --> 01:39:24,727
What's that look! Go!

1446
01:39:37,752 --> 01:39:41,415
Are you there Ammiraju?
- Ammiraju? l'm also here, come in.

1447
01:39:45,593 --> 01:39:48,084
Somebody bashed us with a mask.
- Who is he?

1448
01:39:48,596 --> 01:39:50,587
Tell me the truth, Paidi.
You beat me under the mask.

1449
01:39:50,765 --> 01:39:51,925
He bashed me too.

1450
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:53,931
l'm sure it's him.

1451
01:39:54,268 --> 01:39:55,929
Somebody bashed me!

1452
01:39:56,103 --> 01:40:00,767
Who beat PJ's man?
- lf l beat them, who beat the others?

1453
01:40:05,279 --> 01:40:06,940
We knew you went to beat them.

1454
01:40:07,782 --> 01:40:09,773
lf you beat them they'll suspect you,

1455
01:40:09,950 --> 01:40:11,611
so we too joined and
bashed few others.

1456
01:40:11,786 --> 01:40:13,276
They shouldn't suspect us, right?

1457
01:40:13,454 --> 01:40:15,115
That's why we acted like
we got beaten up.

1458
01:40:15,289 --> 01:40:16,620
You stop it boys!

1459
01:40:18,959 --> 01:40:20,119
Do you drink?

1460
01:40:23,964 --> 01:40:28,128
l didn't say l'll not drink
because l don't drink,

1461
01:40:28,302 --> 01:40:31,135
this is very worse thing,
it'll make you tell the truth,

1462
01:40:31,305 --> 01:40:34,297
let's open ourselves
with some harsh truths. Hold this.

1463
01:40:34,475 --> 01:40:38,639
Can't we do at least on thing
honestly for ourselves, PJ?

1464
01:40:38,813 --> 01:40:43,477
Can you call yourself good man by
buying votes with money and drinks?

1465
01:40:43,651 --> 01:40:48,486
Basically people like that l mean
like you get honoured in public.

1466
01:40:48,656 --> 01:40:53,150
But no father will ever make
you a role model for his son.

1467
01:40:53,661 --> 01:40:57,324
Do one thing honestly.
We're waiting for it.

1468
01:40:57,498 --> 01:40:59,489
The place we hung our
heads in shame,

1469
01:40:59,667 --> 01:41:04,161
we must walking tall with head
held high in that same place, PJ.

1470
01:41:04,672 --> 01:41:06,663
Yes, no need of these short cuts.

1471
01:41:06,841 --> 01:41:08,672
Leader is one who is
adored by people.

1472
01:41:08,843 --> 01:41:11,004
Do something helpful to people
and take them along with you.

1473
01:41:11,178 --> 01:41:14,011
Please don't become lonely.
- What should l do?

1474
01:41:17,685 --> 01:41:18,515
What is this mean?

1475
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:20,509
You mean?

1476
01:41:20,688 --> 01:41:23,020
Pilla Jamindar Student Force!

1477
01:41:23,858 --> 01:41:26,691
You lead us, we'll follow you.

1478
01:41:26,861 --> 01:41:28,351
Okay?
- Yes.

1479
01:41:36,370 --> 01:41:41,364
We all know Praveen withdrew from
elections due to a small mistake,

1480
01:41:41,542 --> 01:41:47,879
but Martin Luther King said no need of
power to know the problems of students.

1481
01:41:48,048 --> 01:41:50,380
Please say it in Telugu!

1482
01:41:50,551 --> 01:41:52,542
That's what we too say,
that's our opinion too.

1483
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:54,711
Tell us your problems, we'll solve it.

1484
01:41:54,889 --> 01:41:57,380
Warming up from now to win next year.

1485
01:41:58,726 --> 01:42:00,557
There's a problem in our college,
can you solve it?

1486
01:42:00,728 --> 01:42:03,390
Tell me, what ever it is,
l'll solve it in seconds.

1487
01:42:03,564 --> 01:42:07,728
That's you! lf you quit college,
problem will be solved. Let's go!

1488
01:42:07,902 --> 01:42:11,394
Please stop!
Please sit down. Please sit down.

1489
01:42:11,739 --> 01:42:12,899
Give us one opportunity.

1490
01:42:13,073 --> 01:42:14,233
How can we give?

1491
01:42:14,408 --> 01:42:15,397
Half yearly exams start
from next week,

1492
01:42:15,576 --> 01:42:16,907
syllabus hasn't yet been completed,

1493
01:42:17,077 --> 01:42:21,571
science teacher and Uddhandapindam
are fighting to become Vice Principal.

1494
01:42:21,749 --> 01:42:25,913
lf possible try to get them
back to the classes.

1495
01:42:27,087 --> 01:42:30,250
We're telling you because science
teacher shares drinks with you.

1496
01:42:30,424 --> 01:42:31,413
Do it,

1497
01:42:31,592 --> 01:42:33,924
we'll then decide to trust
you or not, come girls.

1498
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:42,933
Present principal and the earlier
principal are my old students.

1499
01:42:43,103 --> 01:42:45,094
l'm retiring in 2 years.

1500
01:42:45,272 --> 01:42:46,762
Am l wrong in aspiring to
become vice principal?

1501
01:42:46,941 --> 01:42:49,603
There's no science without me.

1502
01:42:49,777 --> 01:42:52,109
There's no college without science.

1503
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:58,616
ln this situation why shouldn't
l become vice principal?

1504
01:43:00,287 --> 01:43:02,312
l'll tell if you promise not
to beat me.- Tell me.

1505
01:43:03,123 --> 01:43:05,614
Lecturers and committee is
breaking their heads,

1506
01:43:05,793 --> 01:43:08,455
over selecting one of you
as the vice principal.

1507
01:43:08,629 --> 01:43:10,688
lf you reject me, l'll stop.

1508
01:43:10,798 --> 01:43:12,959
You must teach Telugu
to an empty college.

1509
01:43:13,133 --> 01:43:14,623
Go, as if you're teaching
in English now.

1510
01:43:14,802 --> 01:43:16,292
You've to teach science
also in Telugu only.

1511
01:43:16,470 --> 01:43:20,304
Why are you surprised?
This fool is also my former student.

1512
01:43:21,141 --> 01:43:24,804
So students will decide who will
be the next vice principal.

1513
01:43:24,979 --> 01:43:25,968
Through votes.

1514
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:28,311
How did you get such a great idea?

1515
01:43:28,482 --> 01:43:30,643
This is due medical chemical
imbalance...- Stop!

1516
01:43:30,818 --> 01:43:33,309
You said leader is one who
is adored by people.

1517
01:43:33,821 --> 01:43:35,311
ls it okay to you?
- Okay to me.

1518
01:43:35,489 --> 01:43:36,649
Are you ready master?

1519
01:43:38,158 --> 01:43:38,988
We're going for voting!

1520
01:43:39,159 --> 01:43:43,493
But while voting, please write on the
backside why you're voting for him.

1521
01:43:43,664 --> 01:43:44,995
Are you ready to vote?

1522
01:43:48,502 --> 01:43:55,271
Sir, my fathers, my grandfathers,
great grandfathers,

1523
01:43:56,343 --> 01:43:57,503
without having food,

1524
01:43:57,678 --> 01:44:01,512
eating gruel, l mean drinking gruel,
worked for you,

1525
01:44:01,849 --> 01:44:02,679
will you beat with a slipper?

1526
01:44:03,183 --> 01:44:04,013
Sir!

1527
01:44:05,519 --> 01:44:08,511
Who is he?
Who gave this role to him?

1528
01:44:08,689 --> 01:44:10,350
You gave him the role.

1529
01:44:10,524 --> 01:44:12,355
How can l do the work l can't do?

1530
01:44:12,526 --> 01:44:15,017
ls this the way you say with feeling
when the boss beats with slipper?

1531
01:44:15,195 --> 01:44:18,392
Dialogue must come from
heart not from mouth.

1532
01:44:19,033 --> 01:44:22,525
All these years l've been working
very hard for you,

1533
01:44:22,703 --> 01:44:25,194
you were abusing me wildly in
the arrogance of money power,

1534
01:44:25,372 --> 01:44:27,533
and beating me like a beast
without treating me as a human,

1535
01:44:27,708 --> 01:44:29,539
my stomach is burning,

1536
01:44:29,877 --> 01:44:32,038
and that fire must be
seen in your eyes.

1537
01:44:40,220 --> 01:44:44,714
Raja sir, l raised you from
childhood on my shoulders,

1538
01:44:48,395 --> 01:44:49,885
whether you pissed on me
or called me informally,

1539
01:44:50,064 --> 01:44:51,895
l took it easily thinking
you're our boy,

1540
01:44:52,066 --> 01:44:53,727
this old man, before everyone,

1541
01:44:55,069 --> 01:44:58,232
will you beat with a slipper?

1542
01:45:01,909 --> 01:45:04,742
ls this boss' arrogance?

1543
01:45:06,246 --> 01:45:08,077
ls this boss' arrogance?

1544
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:15,582
PJ! Put down the chair,
this is just a play.

1545
01:45:15,756 --> 01:45:18,919
Excellent PJ!
Very good!

1546
01:45:19,093 --> 01:45:20,754
You changed the dialogue.
l don't mind.

1547
01:45:20,928 --> 01:45:22,589
Your performance was amazing!

1548
01:45:22,763 --> 01:45:24,094
You turned the scene effective.

1549
01:45:24,264 --> 01:45:25,253
This is what l want.

1550
01:45:25,432 --> 01:45:27,923
You did a wonderful job, Praveen.
Did you practice well?

1551
01:45:28,102 --> 01:45:32,596
No madam, l used to behave
like that earlier.

1552
01:45:32,773 --> 01:45:34,764
l didn't know the other man's
feelings then.

1553
01:45:35,943 --> 01:45:37,433
l'm getting to know it now.

1554
01:45:44,952 --> 01:45:46,613
Science teacher won in the voting.

1555
01:45:49,289 --> 01:45:50,779
We knew you'll win, sir.

1556
01:45:50,958 --> 01:45:53,290
Why are you standing here?
People are waiting for you.

1557
01:45:54,628 --> 01:45:58,120
l'm thinking of dying.
- Why sir?

1558
01:45:58,298 --> 01:46:04,134
l thought l was admired as a man
for my drinking habit.

1559
01:46:04,304 --> 01:46:06,465
See, what the students think about me.

1560
01:46:07,975 --> 01:46:10,808
Sir, you're a great lecturer
in your subject.

1561
01:46:10,978 --> 01:46:16,644
But when you come to class after smoking,
we've to bear the stench to hear you.

1562
01:46:18,152 --> 01:46:23,317
l felt very sad to call you as science
lecturer seeing you drunken on road.

1563
01:46:25,993 --> 01:46:27,984
l can understand well when you teach,

1564
01:46:28,162 --> 01:46:33,657
but we don't know why your hands
explores us in different places?

1565
01:46:33,834 --> 01:46:35,665
But still we want the
science you teach.

1566
01:46:35,836 --> 01:46:38,828
The voted because they need me.

1567
01:46:39,006 --> 01:46:40,166
They don't like me.

1568
01:46:40,340 --> 01:46:42,831
All of them know my negative qualities,

1569
01:46:43,010 --> 01:46:44,341
l can't be the vice principal.

1570
01:46:48,015 --> 01:46:50,506
As a senior and as a good man,

1571
01:46:50,684 --> 01:46:52,515
Uddhandam must be
the vice principal.

1572
01:46:52,686 --> 01:46:54,847
PJ, Uddhandam is seriously ill.

1573
01:47:07,701 --> 01:47:11,262
He was like my father.
Doctor says no hope.

1574
01:47:12,039 --> 01:47:13,529
Can he take it or not?

1575
01:47:14,041 --> 01:47:15,872
What happened?
- Sir,

1576
01:47:16,043 --> 01:47:20,537
he got excited after losing to you.

1577
01:47:20,881 --> 01:47:23,873
He felt breathlessness,

1578
01:47:24,718 --> 01:47:29,712
l've always seen him as very active,
and a teacher who beats,

1579
01:47:29,890 --> 01:47:31,551
never seen him lying on bed,

1580
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:35,551
go and meet him.

1581
01:47:43,070 --> 01:47:44,731
We're responsible for it.

1582
01:47:44,905 --> 01:47:46,896
We wrote on the backside
of the vote,

1583
01:47:47,074 --> 01:47:48,234
we're like your grand daughters,

1584
01:47:48,408 --> 01:47:51,900
why do you beat us also?
Why are you so angry?

1585
01:47:52,079 --> 01:47:52,909
Calm down children.

1586
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:58,416
Who is he? Why did he go for
voting and brought death on him?

1587
01:47:58,752 --> 01:48:02,415
lt was my mistake, master.
You won!

1588
01:48:02,923 --> 01:48:05,414
You're our college's vice principal.

1589
01:48:06,260 --> 01:48:07,921
Get up master!

1590
01:48:23,110 --> 01:48:24,600
You promised us, sir.

1591
01:48:25,112 --> 01:48:27,774
You'll die a day before Telugu dies.

1592
01:48:28,448 --> 01:48:31,110
We'll not let Telugu to die, sir.
You too sir.

1593
01:48:33,787 --> 01:48:35,448
l'm responsible for this.

1594
01:48:36,290 --> 01:48:39,623
l'll never again do like this.

1595
01:48:50,137 --> 01:48:51,468
Sir, again...

1596
01:48:56,143 --> 01:48:59,806
Say again not again.

1597
01:49:04,151 --> 01:49:09,316
l always pronounce it like that only sir.
Beat me sir...beat me...

1598
01:49:12,326 --> 01:49:15,659
No, l'll never beat anyone again.

1599
01:49:16,163 --> 01:49:18,495
l'll control my anger.

1600
01:49:19,166 --> 01:49:20,690
Hey science crow!

1601
01:49:21,001 --> 01:49:22,992
You're the vice principal.

1602
01:49:24,171 --> 01:49:28,164
No sir, science is available
on internet,

1603
01:49:28,342 --> 01:49:30,333
but teacher like you must
teach us civility.

1604
01:49:31,511 --> 01:49:33,502
Lead us for sometime.

1605
01:49:48,862 --> 01:49:52,025
With this incident PJ has got
a good name in college.

1606
01:49:52,199 --> 01:49:55,362
he's planning to become college
president with this name.

1607
01:49:55,535 --> 01:49:59,027
lf he becomes the president,
it isn't good for me and Sindhu.

1608
01:49:59,206 --> 01:50:01,697
Our caste people dominate
the college,

1609
01:50:01,875 --> 01:50:03,035
how can he get the votes?
- Yes.

1610
01:50:03,210 --> 01:50:07,874
You're the one who can stop him
from becoming the president.- How?

1611
01:50:08,048 --> 01:50:10,710
You're not Ammiraju but Drumraju!

1612
01:50:10,884 --> 01:50:14,047
You contest the next year's election.
- You've won already.

1613
01:50:14,221 --> 01:50:18,055
Ammiraju has won!

1614
01:50:18,225 --> 01:50:21,388
lt seems Ammiraju is contesting
the next elections.

1615
01:50:21,561 --> 01:50:25,053
Let him contest but we mustn't allow
him to become the president.

1616
01:50:25,232 --> 01:50:28,395
You fool, in the village,
mandal level elections...

1617
01:50:28,568 --> 01:50:29,728
l didn't get you man.

1618
01:50:29,903 --> 01:50:32,394
He has caste support and stamp of local.

1619
01:50:32,572 --> 01:50:35,735
We must think smartly and
turn them to support us.

1620
01:50:35,909 --> 01:50:38,400
lt means the use could be
from other place,

1621
01:50:38,578 --> 01:50:41,069
we sow seeds in the ground,

1622
01:50:41,248 --> 01:50:43,079
and pluck the fruits from
the branches,

1623
01:50:43,250 --> 01:50:45,912
like putting on the switch there
to make the bulb light up here.

1624
01:50:52,759 --> 01:50:54,090
Fill it with sand.

1625
01:50:54,261 --> 01:50:56,092
Add sand and blue metal at 3:5 ratio.

1626
01:50:56,263 --> 01:50:57,753
You're students,
why are you doing this work?

1627
01:50:59,933 --> 01:51:04,427
Ammiraju is local, we can't get
support unless we earn good name.

1628
01:51:04,604 --> 01:51:07,767
lf parents put the switch at home,
students in college will vote for us.

1629
01:51:07,941 --> 01:51:10,774
What if the bulb is burnt? l said if.

1630
01:51:12,112 --> 01:51:15,104
Not me, watch out the tractor.
Come...come...

1631
01:51:15,282 --> 01:51:17,273
Move...
- He's coming.

1632
01:51:23,290 --> 01:51:24,120
Move!

1633
01:51:24,458 --> 01:51:27,291
Appi, you've failed and
college students have passed.

1634
01:51:35,635 --> 01:51:36,795
What's this?

1635
01:51:37,304 --> 01:51:38,965
Stop and proceed

1636
01:51:39,139 --> 01:51:40,970
Switch?

1637
01:52:00,327 --> 01:52:05,162
Siripuram Past - Siripuram Welcomes!

1638
01:52:09,336 --> 01:52:11,827
How dare you hit the buffaloes in
the centre and escape!

1639
01:52:12,005 --> 01:52:13,836
l'll take you to task.

1640
01:52:14,007 --> 01:52:16,840
What can you do?
We'll not bring the bus into the village.

1641
01:52:25,018 --> 01:52:27,009
Let it get dark, you'll know it.

1642
01:52:27,187 --> 01:52:28,677
Lamps on buffaloes!

1643
01:52:31,358 --> 01:52:34,020
Take head on, stand up
and be counted...

1644
01:52:36,196 --> 01:52:38,528
Fighter will never give up...

1645
01:52:45,705 --> 01:52:50,369
lf you've a single minded aim,
defeat will have to surrender...

1646
01:52:50,544 --> 01:52:55,038
Take little faltering steps,
raise on your own when you fall down...

1647
01:52:55,215 --> 01:53:00,050
You've to march towards your
aim facing many hurdles...

1648
01:53:00,220 --> 01:53:05,055
lf there's no light,
even Sun is cheap to everyone...

1649
01:53:05,225 --> 01:53:09,719
lf the darkness takes over,
the moonlight gets dull...

1650
01:53:09,896 --> 01:53:14,390
lf you know your true strength,
there's no one to stop you...

1651
01:53:14,568 --> 01:53:19,232
Like sunlight of sun,
like the pleasantness of moon...

1652
01:53:19,406 --> 01:53:24,400
Like a student in progress,
get going silently and firmly...

1653
01:53:34,087 --> 01:53:36,920
Greetings! l'm your Ammiraju.

1654
01:53:37,424 --> 01:53:39,585
Tell your children to vote for me.

1655
01:53:39,759 --> 01:53:40,748
We'll get all the votes of this place.

1656
01:53:40,927 --> 01:53:43,919
We were watching serials,
why did you stop to canvas for votes?

1657
01:53:44,097 --> 01:53:47,260
lf you stop it once again,
l'll beat you with broom. Get lost!

1658
01:53:47,434 --> 01:53:49,425
Why are you talking to
this dirty man, sister?

1659
01:53:49,603 --> 01:53:51,935
They just poured,
thank God, didn't bash us.

1660
01:54:30,477 --> 01:54:34,971
Clench your fist...
opportunities galore...

1661
01:54:35,148 --> 01:54:39,642
lmpossible will bow to you
seeking your forgiveness...

1662
01:54:39,819 --> 01:54:44,483
Earth will not rest thinking
the world has a tomorrow...

1663
01:54:44,658 --> 01:54:49,322
lt keeps on rotating steadily
and firmly...

1664
01:54:49,496 --> 01:54:53,990
Your dream will come true
if you make a try...

1665
01:54:54,167 --> 01:54:59,161
You'll become the role model
if you've good behaviour...

1666
01:55:18,191 --> 01:55:19,180
How to make girls fall for us?

1667
01:55:19,359 --> 01:55:22,351
Either one must become
Siddharth or Lord Krishna.

1668
01:55:22,529 --> 01:55:26,693
Becoming Siddharth is difficult
but Lord Krishna...

1669
01:55:28,868 --> 01:55:30,358
l think he has upset his stomach.

1670
01:55:36,876 --> 01:55:38,207
Lord Krishna!

1671
01:55:38,378 --> 01:55:41,370
l'm Ammiraju not Lord Krishna.

1672
01:55:42,048 --> 01:55:43,538
Will you vote for me?

1673
01:55:43,717 --> 01:55:46,379
Should we vote for you? Come!

1674
01:55:47,387 --> 01:55:48,217
What happened to you?

1675
01:55:48,388 --> 01:55:50,379
Hey Ammiraju! Did you act in play?

1676
01:56:10,577 --> 01:56:12,408
Boy! Are you in PJ's party?

1677
01:56:12,579 --> 01:56:14,911
Not his party, l'm Ammiraju's supporter.

1678
01:56:15,081 --> 01:56:18,414
ls it? You're sure to lick my family's name.

1679
01:56:18,585 --> 01:56:19,415
Your family's name? What's it?

1680
01:56:19,586 --> 01:56:22,578
Sanka! (armpit)
- Sanka?

1681
01:56:29,262 --> 01:56:31,423
Life is very small...

1682
01:56:31,598 --> 01:56:33,759
Won't we leave this world...

1683
01:56:33,933 --> 01:56:38,597
Can we carry these dreams
or fame again...

1684
01:56:38,772 --> 01:56:43,436
Goal is born from your imagination...
journeying towards it is yourjob...

1685
01:56:43,610 --> 01:56:48,274
Journey is the lifeline to
every victory and every turn..

1686
01:56:48,448 --> 01:56:53,112
Won't every day be a new year
if every dawn is yours...

1687
01:56:53,286 --> 01:56:57,950
You'll create a sensation
if you show your talent...

1688
01:57:45,338 --> 01:57:46,498
Village Mediacl Camp
Siripuram PJSF

1689
01:57:57,183 --> 01:57:59,014
l hate human and their sweat.

1690
01:58:04,023 --> 01:58:08,517
Everything is for votes, right?
- No, for my girl friend.

1691
01:58:09,362 --> 01:58:11,193
For my 90 year old girl friend.

1692
01:58:12,532 --> 01:58:14,523
l've started liking you recently,
don't know why but it's true.

1693
01:58:14,868 --> 01:58:17,200
l want to talk to you.

1694
01:58:18,371 --> 01:58:20,202
What's it?
- Not now.

1695
01:58:20,373 --> 01:58:21,362
Ammi, it seems not now.

1696
01:58:21,541 --> 01:58:24,374
PJ has changed a lot,
l'll vote for him only.

1697
01:58:24,544 --> 01:58:26,876
My father too told me to elect him.
- Take...

1698
01:58:27,213 --> 01:58:31,206
Not just your father, entire village is
discussing it like general election.

1699
01:58:31,384 --> 01:58:34,876
l don't mind if you don't vote to me,
but please don't vote to PJ.

1700
01:58:35,054 --> 01:58:37,887
Don't vote to PJ!

1701
01:58:38,057 --> 01:58:39,547
What happened to you, Ammi?

1702
01:58:39,726 --> 01:58:42,058
Why are you telling about him
instead of yourself?- Go man!

1703
01:58:42,395 --> 01:58:43,726
Don't vote to PJ!

1704
01:58:43,897 --> 01:58:46,388
Poor boy doesn't to get angry also.

1705
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:50,233
l'm doing a role of rich man
in this year's drama,

1706
01:58:50,403 --> 01:58:53,065
l want good shirts like
the ones PJ wears.

1707
01:58:53,239 --> 01:58:55,571
Have you come with money?
- That's why l've brought PJ.

1708
01:58:56,075 --> 01:58:57,736
You want sir?
- No thanks.

1709
01:58:58,411 --> 01:59:00,072
Did you see?

1710
01:59:00,246 --> 01:59:02,908
Did you but this T-shirt here?

1711
01:59:03,082 --> 01:59:05,243
No uncle, where did you buy it?

1712
01:59:05,418 --> 01:59:06,248
l think its London.

1713
01:59:06,419 --> 01:59:07,750
lt seems London,
l mean another country.

1714
01:59:07,921 --> 01:59:10,082
How much?
- May be Rs.3000!

1715
01:59:10,256 --> 01:59:13,919
You got cheated sir! You'll get
3 for Rs.100 only in my shop sir.

1716
01:59:14,093 --> 01:59:16,084
3 for Rs.100?
Show me.

1717
01:59:16,596 --> 01:59:19,588
See! Same design!

1718
01:59:20,767 --> 01:59:23,668
Check it.

1719
01:59:23,770 --> 01:59:25,101
You really got cheated.

1720
01:59:25,605 --> 01:59:28,438
Please buy it.- This one?
lt'll be good, buy it.

1721
01:59:28,942 --> 01:59:31,775
Take it...take it...

1722
01:59:31,945 --> 01:59:34,277
Take care of what he wants,
l'll come back in a moment.

1723
01:59:40,787 --> 01:59:43,017
How much is this one?
- Rs.50.

1724
01:59:43,456 --> 01:59:46,016
Take it for Rs.45.

1725
01:59:47,794 --> 01:59:50,786
How much you'll get for selling this?
- Rs.10.

1726
01:59:56,636 --> 01:59:59,298
Rs.100? No thanks.

1727
01:59:59,472 --> 02:00:00,700
Keep it.- No thanks please.
- Please take it.

1728
02:00:00,974 --> 02:00:02,464
God bless you son.

1729
02:00:14,153 --> 02:00:14,983
Why are you smiling, PJ?

1730
02:00:15,154 --> 02:00:18,988
My friends there wouldn't be happy
even if l spent Rs.5000 on parties.

1731
02:00:19,158 --> 02:00:21,149
l didn't even spend Rs.500 here.

1732
02:00:21,494 --> 02:00:23,985
The old lady is still working
to earn a decent living.

1733
02:00:25,665 --> 02:00:27,326
How are they able to live
so content fully?

1734
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:29,661
Neither it is in Rs.500 nor in Rs.5000,

1735
02:00:29,836 --> 02:00:31,667
happiness and contentedness is here.

1736
02:00:32,505 --> 02:00:35,497
How?- The day no fish caught, what ever
food left in home is served to me,

1737
02:00:35,675 --> 02:00:37,506
mother used to sleep on empty stomach,

1738
02:00:37,677 --> 02:00:40,339
mother was more happy then,
you know why?

1739
02:00:40,680 --> 02:00:42,841
Thinking at least l had my stomach full.

1740
02:00:43,016 --> 02:00:44,176
Didn't get it, right?

1741
02:00:44,350 --> 02:00:47,683
God created us to love and use things.

1742
02:00:47,854 --> 02:00:51,085
But in our confusion we use
humans and love things.

1743
02:00:52,525 --> 02:00:54,356
The day this changes,
it's happiness everywhere.

1744
02:00:54,527 --> 02:00:55,858
Everyone will be happy.

1745
02:00:59,866 --> 02:01:00,696
Stop!

1746
02:01:00,867 --> 02:01:03,199
Somebody is calling,
he wants to talk to you only.

1747
02:01:11,210 --> 02:01:17,877
Hey nationalization! lt's getting dark,
call if you've to call anyone.

1748
02:01:21,220 --> 02:01:24,553
l was a toddler when
l lost my mother,

1749
02:01:25,558 --> 02:01:27,048
now he's dead,

1750
02:01:27,727 --> 02:01:29,558
l don't know anyone else.

1751
02:01:30,730 --> 02:01:34,063
My father is dead!

1752
02:01:40,907 --> 02:01:42,738
How long will you sit like this?

1753
02:01:42,909 --> 02:01:45,400
lf you cry,
can the dead man come back?

1754
02:01:45,578 --> 02:01:48,445
Call someone, let's cremate him.
- How can you do it?

1755
02:01:50,249 --> 02:01:51,739
You need at least four people to carry.

1756
02:01:51,918 --> 02:01:53,408
Father!

1757
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:56,252
l told you to be with our caste
people, you didn't care.

1758
02:01:56,756 --> 02:01:58,815
Will you say no to me for that outsider?

1759
02:01:59,092 --> 02:02:00,423
l'll see now who will help you!

1760
02:02:00,593 --> 02:02:02,424
Cry sitting with the corpse here.

1761
02:02:02,595 --> 02:02:03,755
Stop it, you...

1762
02:02:06,599 --> 02:02:09,932
You get up.
Please take him away.

1763
02:02:12,939 --> 02:02:14,429
Please don't let him become an orphan.

1764
02:02:14,607 --> 02:02:16,438
Why are you playing politics now?

1765
02:02:18,945 --> 02:02:21,778
PJ, no acting please,
this is our caste issue.

1766
02:02:21,948 --> 02:02:22,846
Mind your business.

1767
02:02:23,616 --> 02:02:26,779
What's this?
He plays drama with every issue.

1768
02:02:27,787 --> 02:02:28,776
Come on boys.

1769
02:03:01,988 --> 02:03:04,980
Super! With this you'll get all the
votes of his caste.

1770
02:03:08,995 --> 02:03:10,656
You're no different from Ammiraju.

1771
02:03:11,664 --> 02:03:12,995
Do you see votes there?

1772
02:03:13,166 --> 02:03:15,498
l see the smile of Nationalization
burning over there.

1773
02:03:17,336 --> 02:03:19,668
l'm thinking about money only.

1774
02:03:20,339 --> 02:03:23,331
How will he live losing the only
bread winner of the family?

1775
02:03:24,844 --> 02:03:27,176
You wanted me to change
but you've changed.

1776
02:03:32,185 --> 02:03:34,517
Why did you say like
that now, Kannababu?

1777
02:03:35,021 --> 02:03:37,182
l was just testing if he has
really changed or not.

1778
02:03:38,024 --> 02:03:39,855
l don't know if he can become
the president or not,

1779
02:03:40,026 --> 02:03:41,516
but l'm sure he'll become a leader.

1780
02:03:41,694 --> 02:03:47,030
When you can nationalize our things,
can't we nationalize your grief and burden?

1781
02:03:48,367 --> 02:03:49,857
We're all there for you.

1782
02:03:57,376 --> 02:03:59,867
Second year results are out, Jayaramaraju.

1783
02:04:00,046 --> 02:04:02,537
Uncle, that is...
- You've passed.

1784
02:04:02,715 --> 02:04:04,876
You're submitting the project
work tomorrow, right?

1785
02:04:05,051 --> 02:04:06,382
l'll submit, uncle.

1786
02:04:06,719 --> 02:04:08,710
Sindhu was here to meet you.

1787
02:04:18,231 --> 02:04:19,892
Will you come out on date with me?

1788
02:04:21,400 --> 02:04:22,492
But not like this.

1789
02:04:22,902 --> 02:04:25,234
lt's been many days since
l've seen you as PJ.

1790
02:04:42,755 --> 02:04:46,919
Go around me...

1791
02:04:47,093 --> 02:04:50,585
l swear my love for you is
growing like an honeycomb...

1792
02:04:50,763 --> 02:04:55,257
Be patient...

1793
02:04:55,434 --> 02:05:00,269
lf love hits back,
the secret will be out...

1794
02:05:00,439 --> 02:05:06,776
l've embossed you in my heart,
O Kondapalli doll...

1795
02:05:06,946 --> 02:05:12,942
l'm a sweet bird,
you're my sweetness...

1796
02:05:13,119 --> 02:05:16,282
Stop looking at me,
come to me, my dear...

1797
02:05:16,455 --> 02:05:19,447
Oh no! l'm still a little girl...

1798
02:05:19,625 --> 02:05:22,458
The bed is rocking...

1799
02:05:22,628 --> 02:05:25,961
Shall we break it and
make it useless?

1800
02:05:26,132 --> 02:05:32,469
My long plait is angry...
will you tie the knot with me?

1801
02:05:51,824 --> 02:05:54,816
l know the fish in the hook...
l know the bone in fish...

1802
02:05:54,994 --> 02:05:57,986
But l don't know the heart of
this fish eyed beauty...

1803
02:05:58,164 --> 02:06:00,997
Shyness is our relative...
you're a traditional suitor...

1804
02:06:01,167 --> 02:06:04,330
lsn't it a woman's birth right
to be secretive?

1805
02:06:04,503 --> 02:06:10,669
You've blindfolded your heart...
remove and see, you'll find me...

1806
02:06:10,843 --> 02:06:17,009
l foresee the future...
l won't stop myself after seeing you...

1807
02:06:17,183 --> 02:06:20,175
Shed shyness...say yes to me....

1808
02:06:20,353 --> 02:06:23,686
Without getting confused or
any hesitation, O my dear...

1809
02:06:23,856 --> 02:06:29,852
Don't search out, find within
yourself l'm there in you...

1810
02:06:55,554 --> 02:07:01,390
l've brought the bullock cart...
l've brought the small car...

1811
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:04,552
Let's go to the festival...

1812
02:07:04,730 --> 02:07:07,893
l don't want bullock cart
or small car...

1813
02:07:08,067 --> 02:07:10,900
l love if you give me
a piggyback ride...

1814
02:07:11,070 --> 02:07:14,062
Shall l get you jasmine or lily?

1815
02:07:14,240 --> 02:07:21,237
No need of any flowers, my beau...
your smiles are enough, come my dear...

1816
02:07:43,769 --> 02:07:45,259
ls everyone here for the debate?

1817
02:07:45,438 --> 02:07:48,930
Rajanna, its 11 am, where is he?

1818
02:07:49,108 --> 02:07:50,939
Yes, where's PJ?

1819
02:07:51,777 --> 02:07:57,113
You can't start the debate
without the opponent, Ammiraju.

1820
02:07:57,450 --> 02:08:01,181
He's a drunkard; he would be
sleeping after a drinking binge.

1821
02:08:02,621 --> 02:08:05,454
Did you see PJ anywhere?
- No. Not seen anywhere.

1822
02:08:07,626 --> 02:08:09,617
Did you see him?
- He's not in hostel too.

1823
02:08:09,795 --> 02:08:11,456
What's this drama, sir?

1824
02:08:12,298 --> 02:08:13,788
Dear students!

1825
02:08:14,133 --> 02:08:16,795
Please vote for me and
make me your president.

1826
02:08:17,303 --> 02:08:20,136
What else you want,
l'll do anything.

1827
02:08:20,306 --> 02:08:22,467
ln my rule, l'll cut the college trees,

1828
02:08:22,641 --> 02:08:24,131
l'll put up electric poles,

1829
02:08:24,310 --> 02:08:26,141
and make this college
shine bright with lights,

1830
02:08:26,312 --> 02:08:29,213
Hail motherland! Hail Ammiraju!

1831
02:08:29,982 --> 02:08:32,143
Greetings my dear brothers
and sisters,

1832
02:08:32,318 --> 02:08:36,482
l'll build a bus stop on our
college's name,

1833
02:08:36,655 --> 02:08:38,145
l'll put up name boards,

1834
02:08:38,324 --> 02:08:41,157
l'm asking is there anyone
who can do well?

1835
02:08:41,327 --> 02:08:43,158
l must pinch his thigh, idiot!

1836
02:08:45,331 --> 02:08:47,822
Are we useless fools?
Just 5 minutes only.

1837
02:08:49,168 --> 02:08:51,159
l'll erect a fountain in the
middle of our village.

1838
02:08:51,337 --> 02:08:52,167
l mean a tap that spills water.

1839
02:08:52,338 --> 02:08:53,498
l'll build a park around it.

1840
02:08:53,672 --> 02:08:58,507
ln that park, l'll erect a statue of
our caste leader Bomma Pitchaiah,

1841
02:08:58,677 --> 02:09:00,167
Brothers and sisters...

1842
02:09:00,346 --> 02:09:04,578
l told him watch news channel,
l think he saw all the channels.

1843
02:09:08,354 --> 02:09:09,514
Here comes PJ!

1844
02:09:10,022 --> 02:09:12,013
Here he is!
- Please come quickly on the dais.

1845
02:09:12,191 --> 02:09:13,852
See, the stink is reaching up to here.

1846
02:09:15,361 --> 02:09:17,522
lt's all over, sir.
How can you allow him now?

1847
02:09:22,368 --> 02:09:23,858
Yes, l'm a drunkard.

1848
02:09:24,203 --> 02:09:25,693
l'm a loafer too.

1849
02:09:26,705 --> 02:09:29,868
But l've a qualification which
Ammiraju doesn't have it.

1850
02:09:31,710 --> 02:09:32,699
That is...

1851
02:09:35,381 --> 02:09:38,544
Thinking!

1852
02:09:38,717 --> 02:09:41,550
l don't why do we needs lights in
college which closes by 4 pm.

1853
02:09:41,720 --> 02:09:43,381
That too after cutting down the trees.

1854
02:09:44,390 --> 02:09:47,882
There are mounds of broken
benches behind the auditorium.

1855
02:09:48,394 --> 02:09:50,726
lt seems he'll put up benches
somewhere in village.

1856
02:09:50,896 --> 02:09:52,056
Students standing out there,

1857
02:09:52,231 --> 02:09:54,563
if you want to hear this debate
sitting on bench at least next year,

1858
02:09:54,733 --> 02:09:57,896
get the benches repaired,
- Good.- What do you say?

1859
02:09:59,405 --> 02:10:00,633
Then our science lab,

1860
02:10:01,907 --> 02:10:02,896
without the equipment,

1861
02:10:03,075 --> 02:10:05,066
students are using steel glasses
instead of glass equipment,

1862
02:10:05,911 --> 02:10:10,746
recently big chunks of roof fell off,
l was the one who got hurt,

1863
02:10:11,417 --> 02:10:13,408
thank God Sindhu was there
to write my exam,

1864
02:10:15,254 --> 02:10:16,585
What did he say just now?

1865
02:10:16,755 --> 02:10:19,747
Fountain in village and a statue.
Good!

1866
02:10:20,426 --> 02:10:24,260
Septic tank is broken and
the smell is reaching kitchen.

1867
02:10:24,430 --> 02:10:25,260
No, stench.

1868
02:10:25,764 --> 02:10:29,427
No proper books in the library,
no proper water taps in toilets,

1869
02:10:29,602 --> 02:10:30,432
Are there so many problems
without coming to our knowledge?

1870
02:10:30,603 --> 02:10:31,262
Please note it down.

1871
02:10:31,437 --> 02:10:32,927
There are not much finds to repair it.

1872
02:10:33,105 --> 02:10:35,096
This is our college,
we must repair it ourselves.

1873
02:10:35,441 --> 02:10:37,102
Yes, l'm a drunkard.

1874
02:10:37,443 --> 02:10:39,274
l had farex too as an infant.

1875
02:10:39,445 --> 02:10:42,437
Both are past.
See what l'm now!

1876
02:10:43,949 --> 02:10:46,281
To solve your problems and
to be your leader,

1877
02:10:46,452 --> 02:10:49,114
l'm creating myself newly every day,

1878
02:10:50,289 --> 02:10:51,119
and keep on doing.

1879
02:10:54,960 --> 02:10:55,790
Your decision!

1880
02:10:57,463 --> 02:11:00,227
Not this!
l'll speak!

1881
02:11:00,633 --> 02:11:03,124
l've been watching PJ from day one,

1882
02:11:03,302 --> 02:11:04,963
PJ has changed a lot,

1883
02:11:05,137 --> 02:11:08,300
a leader is one who changes
himself first to bring change,

1884
02:11:08,474 --> 02:11:09,304
PJ is our leader!

1885
02:11:09,475 --> 02:11:12,308
Are you done? Half of the
students belong to my caste.

1886
02:11:12,478 --> 02:11:13,308
Why don't you say something boys?

1887
02:11:13,479 --> 02:11:14,810
Do you see votes there?

1888
02:11:14,980 --> 02:11:17,312
l see the smile of Nationalization
burning over there.

1889
02:11:17,483 --> 02:11:19,144
l'm thinking of money only now.

1890
02:11:19,318 --> 02:11:23,482
President from our caste is helpful,
what's the use if an outsider becomes?

1891
02:11:23,656 --> 02:11:24,315
Tell boys!

1892
02:11:24,490 --> 02:11:26,651
What caste?

1893
02:11:26,825 --> 02:11:30,022
He saw a friend in sorrow
not his caste.

1894
02:11:30,663 --> 02:11:32,995
lt was we who played politics
even on dead bodies.

1895
02:11:33,666 --> 02:11:36,658
Students who think they're born to
parents out of love come with me,

1896
02:11:36,835 --> 02:11:40,168
if you think it's for caste,
then be with him.

1897
02:11:43,008 --> 02:11:44,839
What are you waiting for? Get up!

1898
02:11:45,010 --> 02:11:49,003
Stop...l beg you...stop...

1899
02:11:49,181 --> 02:11:51,672
Who is your leader?

1900
02:11:51,850 --> 02:11:58,187
PJ is our leader!

1901
02:12:11,203 --> 02:12:12,693
No way! l'll talk again.

1902
02:12:13,539 --> 02:12:17,373
lt has been decided to elect PJ
as the new president.

1903
02:12:17,543 --> 02:12:20,034
This is cheating,
l'll walk out in protest.

1904
02:12:23,882 --> 02:12:25,372
Six months later...
- Go that side.

1905
02:12:27,219 --> 02:12:28,049
What's our plan, boss?

1906
02:12:28,220 --> 02:12:31,053
Boss? This is pre-climax.
Sircar plan.

1907
02:12:32,224 --> 02:12:34,215
lf you cut it.- You didn't begin and
already a cut, Sircar.

1908
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:36,050
Shut up, l've paid him Rs.50000.

1909
02:12:38,063 --> 02:12:39,052
Okay.

1910
02:12:39,231 --> 02:12:41,392
lf you cut it, a mud road...

1911
02:12:41,567 --> 02:12:44,900
On that mud road your heroine
and your villain...

1912
02:12:45,070 --> 02:12:46,560
on a Hero Honda bike...

1913
02:12:46,739 --> 02:12:48,730
Not Hero Honda bike sir,
Hero One bicycle.

1914
02:12:50,075 --> 02:12:52,475
Boys, use a thin wire.
- Why a wire, Sircar?

1915
02:12:52,911 --> 02:12:55,744
Don't you watch films?
Sumos fly in air in the films.

1916
02:12:55,914 --> 02:12:57,074
You'll see live now.

1917
02:12:57,249 --> 02:13:02,585
The cycle that is coming fast will
hit the stiff wire across the road,

1918
02:13:02,755 --> 02:13:04,586
it'll fly high into the air!

1919
02:13:05,591 --> 02:13:07,923
Unlike last time,
you must write the exam.

1920
02:13:08,093 --> 02:13:09,424
ls it?
- Got it?- Very well.

1921
02:13:09,595 --> 02:13:12,428
Your villain's lifecycle will
get punctured.

1922
02:13:14,266 --> 02:13:15,096
Already it's over.

1923
02:13:16,101 --> 02:13:19,093
Bloody Sircar plan!
- Cool, l've shelled out Rs.50000.

1924
02:13:19,271 --> 02:13:20,602
You gave and lost it too.

1925
02:13:20,939 --> 02:13:22,429
l think puncture again.

1926
02:13:22,608 --> 02:13:26,135
My plan flopping? No way.
Kill him boys! Come on boys!

1927
02:13:27,112 --> 02:13:27,942
Brother!

1928
02:13:28,447 --> 02:13:30,438
Brother?
- We're finished.
- Come let's go.

1929
02:13:31,617 --> 02:13:32,948
Brother, move...he our man.

1930
02:13:33,118 --> 02:13:34,278
We put a wire, please pay us.

1931
02:13:34,453 --> 02:13:36,785
l don't want people who
work for money only. Go away.

1932
02:13:37,956 --> 02:13:41,119
What are you doing here?
Still not yet reformed?

1933
02:13:41,960 --> 02:13:43,791
Where's the Chunni?
- She left with Jenny.

1934
02:13:43,962 --> 02:13:45,953
l'm ashamed to talk about it.

1935
02:13:46,131 --> 02:13:47,792
l beat you because
she went with you.- What?

1936
02:13:47,966 --> 02:13:49,627
That is got beaten up by you.

1937
02:13:49,968 --> 02:13:52,300
Forget all that l gave up studies.

1938
02:13:52,471 --> 02:13:53,631
l'm living by running kangaroo courts.

1939
02:13:53,806 --> 02:13:57,799
That's what we learnt in
college, right? l mean l...

1940
02:14:00,312 --> 02:14:02,473
What's this trouble?
l've to go to write exam.

1941
02:14:02,648 --> 02:14:06,812
You go brother, the man who
gave me money to kill you...he's gone!

1942
02:14:06,985 --> 02:14:08,316
l'll take him to task.

1943
02:14:11,323 --> 02:14:15,157
l'll take to task Ammiraju
and his family.

1944
02:14:16,829 --> 02:14:18,490
Why are you standing there
like 100 days poster?

1945
02:14:18,664 --> 02:14:20,495
Ask if PJ needs any slips.

1946
02:14:20,666 --> 02:14:22,497
Brother...
- Don't ask money in location.

1947
02:14:24,169 --> 02:14:26,501
Would like to see mine?
- Write.

1948
02:14:32,845 --> 02:14:35,507
We paid him money and
ended up as losers.

1949
02:14:35,681 --> 02:14:39,515
We paid him, let him do something.

1950
02:14:39,685 --> 02:14:41,846
Who is there?
- Nobody.

1951
02:14:42,020 --> 02:14:43,351
lt seems nobody is there.

1952
02:15:03,876 --> 02:15:05,537
l think you've written your
exams well, PJ.

1953
02:15:05,711 --> 02:15:06,370
l have written well, madam.

1954
02:15:06,545 --> 02:15:08,035
What about Kannababu?

1955
02:15:11,049 --> 02:15:12,710
Has everyone come?

1956
02:15:14,386 --> 02:15:16,217
Looks like a foreign car.

1957
02:15:20,726 --> 02:15:22,557
Our Kannababu!

1958
02:15:27,399 --> 02:15:28,559
lt's me, master.

1959
02:15:28,734 --> 02:15:31,066
My father used to go fishing
on iron boats,

1960
02:15:31,236 --> 02:15:32,225
it used to get rust,

1961
02:15:32,404 --> 02:15:35,066
l used to think how my education
would help my father,

1962
02:15:35,240 --> 02:15:39,574
my experiment on bio-coat paint to
stop rust won Planet Green award.

1963
02:15:39,745 --> 02:15:41,736
That's all l got big job
and good salary.

1964
02:15:41,914 --> 02:15:44,906
lt's all your mercy, master.
- l'm very happy, boy.

1965
02:15:45,083 --> 02:15:47,244
PJ is receiving the degree,
let's watch it.

1966
02:15:49,087 --> 02:15:51,920
...is receiving degree from VC.

1967
02:16:07,439 --> 02:16:09,600
Every year when students
left the college,

1968
02:16:09,775 --> 02:16:12,938
we used to feel proud that they
changed because of our toughness.

1969
02:16:13,111 --> 02:16:17,605
But this year l feel sad like
my own children leaving me.

1970
02:16:21,453 --> 02:16:24,616
How could he get degree?
l'll not accept. He's a cheat.

1971
02:16:26,792 --> 02:16:28,953
You're a fraud.

1972
02:16:29,461 --> 02:16:33,625
He didn't become president for us,
but for the wealth.

1973
02:16:34,967 --> 02:16:35,956
lt's a along story.

1974
02:16:36,134 --> 02:16:40,298
He cooked up tales about repairing
the college roof, benches, lab.

1975
02:16:40,472 --> 02:16:42,633
You believed him and voted him
to be your president.

1976
02:16:42,808 --> 02:16:44,639
What did he do?
He cheated you.

1977
02:16:44,810 --> 02:16:46,471
He'll take the degree and go away.

1978
02:16:47,312 --> 02:16:50,645
Take his resignation,
only then he'll come to senses.

1979
02:16:50,816 --> 02:16:51,646
He'll not get the wealth.

1980
02:16:51,817 --> 02:16:54,308
Wealth? Where is it?

1981
02:16:55,821 --> 02:16:57,982
With just one year of friendship,

1982
02:16:58,156 --> 02:16:59,987
for my sake, without batting
an eye, billions of his wealth,

1983
02:17:00,158 --> 02:17:01,989
he gave it up, PJ is
so foolish, Ammiraju.

1984
02:17:02,828 --> 02:17:03,658
He's not a cheat.

1985
02:17:03,829 --> 02:17:06,320
You say he has become
president to get his wealth.

1986
02:17:06,498 --> 02:17:09,661
But you don't know what had happened
a day before he became president.

1987
02:17:15,173 --> 02:17:18,165
Who are the patient's relatives?
- Tell me.

1988
02:17:21,013 --> 02:17:23,174
We're sending his liver
tissue to Bombay,

1989
02:17:23,348 --> 02:17:26,181
according to my opinion,
it's completely damaged,

1990
02:17:26,351 --> 02:17:28,683
l think they've neglected
it for long time.

1991
02:17:28,854 --> 02:17:30,344
lf that's the problem,

1992
02:17:30,522 --> 02:17:36,017
get ready a blood relative to
donate liver and Rs.25 lakhs.

1993
02:17:42,701 --> 02:17:45,033
l'm telling l don't have money,
leave me alone.

1994
02:17:50,709 --> 02:17:51,698
No...

1995
02:17:58,550 --> 02:18:00,040
l know you're calling me for money.

1996
02:18:00,218 --> 02:18:01,776
As a businessman, l'll never
invest in losing ventures.

1997
02:18:03,221 --> 02:18:04,711
l told you not to meet him.

1998
02:18:04,890 --> 02:18:06,721
Why did you go?
Come back immediately.

1999
02:18:08,226 --> 02:18:11,559
Would've said no money, any advises?

2000
02:18:12,564 --> 02:18:14,054
Threats!

2001
02:18:16,401 --> 02:18:18,562
Rs.25 lakhs?

2002
02:18:18,737 --> 02:18:23,071
From your wealth,
l mean your grandpa's wealth,

2003
02:18:23,241 --> 02:18:26,733
l'm not allowed to give you
even a penny.

2004
02:18:27,746 --> 02:18:29,577
Till you complete your degree...

2005
02:18:33,251 --> 02:18:36,743
Lend me as loan.
- Loan? What do you have?

2006
02:18:36,922 --> 02:18:39,254
Except the arrogance of
your grandpa's wealth.

2007
02:18:39,758 --> 02:18:41,749
l've given tips more than this.

2008
02:18:42,928 --> 02:18:47,422
But now l know money has the
power to save a human life.

2009
02:18:47,766 --> 02:18:51,258
l'm useless, l'll get ruined
if l get the wealth.

2010
02:18:51,436 --> 02:18:53,597
He's brilliant, a great scholar.

2011
02:18:54,106 --> 02:18:57,269
lf he lives, he has power to
change lives of many.

2012
02:18:57,442 --> 02:19:01,776
Let him die.
Who cares if a poor man dies or lives?

2013
02:19:32,144 --> 02:19:33,805
Why are you getting tensed?

2014
02:19:33,979 --> 02:19:39,144
lf l die, my birth date and death
are put under my photo,

2015
02:19:39,985 --> 02:19:43,148
but if you get the degree,
you can help thousands like me.

2016
02:19:44,823 --> 02:19:45,812
Go.

2017
02:19:54,666 --> 02:19:59,000
l've given a good thought on your
words, l felt your sincerity,

2018
02:19:59,171 --> 02:20:00,661
you wanted to help your friend,

2019
02:20:00,839 --> 02:20:03,831
l thoroughly checked your
grandpa's will,

2020
02:20:04,009 --> 02:20:05,670
before fulfilling the conditions,

2021
02:20:05,844 --> 02:20:10,008
if you accept you're incompetent
and sign the papers
giving up the property,

2022
02:20:10,182 --> 02:20:14,846
your grandpa allotted Rs.30 lakhs for you.
Will you accept it?

2023
02:20:15,353 --> 02:20:18,015
Tell me, do you want
Rs.30 lakhs for your friend?

2024
02:20:18,190 --> 02:20:19,851
Or you want the wealth for yourself?

2025
02:20:26,031 --> 02:20:26,861
True sir.

2026
02:20:29,367 --> 02:20:33,201
lfe he says he gave up wealth for
his operation, you may stop him,

2027
02:20:33,538 --> 02:20:35,699
so he lied that l had
arranged the money.

2028
02:20:39,377 --> 02:20:40,366
No problem.

2029
02:21:06,238 --> 02:21:08,229
This is what l'm left with.

2030
02:21:09,241 --> 02:21:11,232
lf it can be useful to college...

2031
02:21:16,915 --> 02:21:18,314
Sit down, we've lost our honour.

2032
02:21:22,087 --> 02:21:24,317
How will you live without money, PJ?

2033
02:21:26,758 --> 02:21:29,249
She's asking how would l live?

2034
02:21:30,095 --> 02:21:31,756
l came here with fear.

2035
02:21:32,597 --> 02:21:33,928
Not for degree.

2036
02:21:34,099 --> 02:21:36,761
With a doubt if l would get
the wealth or not.

2037
02:21:38,103 --> 02:21:39,627
l thought it's all over.

2038
02:21:40,438 --> 02:21:42,770
But after coming here, l won over life.

2039
02:21:44,943 --> 02:21:48,106
You're worrying how l would
live without money.

2040
02:21:48,613 --> 02:21:52,947
But in these two years you all
gave me that confidence.

2041
02:21:54,953 --> 02:21:57,114
lt's not just teachers
who taught me here,

2042
02:21:57,289 --> 02:22:00,452
there are two others,
life and time!

2043
02:22:00,792 --> 02:22:03,784
The life l spent here will
lead me all the time,

2044
02:22:03,962 --> 02:22:07,295
but the two years spent here
made me see what is life.

2045
02:22:11,136 --> 02:22:14,970
l thought it's an achievement to
spend 2 years with such people.

2046
02:22:15,140 --> 02:22:18,473
But when l realised they endured
a man like me for 2 years,

2047
02:22:18,643 --> 02:22:20,474
l've understood the greatness of
their friendship and greatness.

2048
02:22:26,985 --> 02:22:30,648
l've realised happiness is not
in pubs, cars or in luxuries.

2049
02:22:31,990 --> 02:22:36,984
How to spend a rupee and
how to see humans as humans,

2050
02:22:37,162 --> 02:22:38,493
how to mingle with them,

2051
02:22:38,997 --> 02:22:40,328
how to smile,

2052
02:22:40,498 --> 02:22:42,989
last but the least l learnt
how to cry also here only.

2053
02:22:44,002 --> 02:22:48,837
My grandpa's wealth gave me
fear of losing only.

2054
02:22:49,007 --> 02:22:51,999
But the wealth you gave me is
confidence to face life,

2055
02:22:52,177 --> 02:22:54,509
and live against all odds.

2056
02:22:58,516 --> 02:23:02,680
lf l ever take a wrong step in life,
l'll come back here sir.

2057
02:23:04,022 --> 02:23:05,683
Would l get a room here, sir?

2058
02:23:06,524 --> 02:23:09,357
Here, always it's here for you.

2059
02:23:28,880 --> 02:23:30,871
What brings you this far, Sharat?

2060
02:23:31,049 --> 02:23:33,381
Looks like your girth has increased.
l think you're missing me.

2061
02:23:33,551 --> 02:23:36,714
Respect?
You used to call me informally.

2062
02:23:37,222 --> 02:23:40,055
There's a last condition.

2063
02:23:40,225 --> 02:23:41,886
Condition? Again?

2064
02:23:42,060 --> 02:23:44,893
l don't have anything left
other than my grandpa.
- There is!

2065
02:23:45,230 --> 02:23:47,391
Your grandpa's will's idea
is to change you.

2066
02:23:47,565 --> 02:23:48,725
l know as a human.

2067
02:23:48,900 --> 02:23:52,392
For human welfare...
- Look, l got 42 marks only in Telugu.

2068
02:23:52,570 --> 02:23:54,731
l got it, that you're not getting it.

2069
02:23:54,906 --> 02:23:59,570
lf you're ready to give up the
wealth for a good cause,

2070
02:23:59,744 --> 02:24:02,406
your grandpa's will suggests
you can gift the entire wealth.

2071
02:24:02,580 --> 02:24:06,072
You've got the invaluable,
accept the wealth as gift.

2072
02:24:06,751 --> 02:24:08,742
You don't get one thing.
- What's it?

2073
02:24:08,920 --> 02:24:10,410
l don't like gifts.

2074
02:24:10,588 --> 02:24:12,419
Then, accept it as responsibility.

2075
02:24:12,590 --> 02:24:15,423
Why did you come personally?
A phone call and l would've come.

2076
02:24:18,596 --> 02:24:19,927
Lord!

2077
02:24:20,098 --> 02:24:22,259
You're working for me, right?- Sir.

2078
02:24:22,934 --> 02:24:24,094
Give me a hug.

2079
02:24:34,446 --> 02:24:36,107
ls the fancy dress ready?

2080
02:24:36,281 --> 02:24:39,444
PJ, Ammiraju has kidnapped Sindhu.

2081
02:24:39,617 --> 02:24:42,108
Who?
- Sindhu.

2082
02:24:42,954 --> 02:24:44,114
Did you see Chunky?

2083
02:24:44,289 --> 02:24:47,622
He was roaming in long skirt
like girl for fashion show.

2084
02:24:50,295 --> 02:24:51,626
Why did you kidnap me?

2085
02:24:51,796 --> 02:24:52,956
Try to answer yourself.

2086
02:24:59,304 --> 02:25:01,795
What did l say now?
- You said rape, boss.

2087
02:25:01,973 --> 02:25:05,136
Rape means that thing, right?
- lndeed.

2088
02:25:08,813 --> 02:25:13,477
Rape mean not what you do,
but what is done to you.

2089
02:25:13,651 --> 02:25:15,983
That's it, promise, swear...

2090
02:25:17,655 --> 02:25:21,318
l'll not say differently under
promise and without it.

2091
02:25:22,327 --> 02:25:25,228
People always say this
and then do nothing.

2092
02:25:31,836 --> 02:25:33,497
ls Ammiraju okay to you?

2093
02:25:40,678 --> 02:25:41,838
Anyone is okay to me.

2094
02:25:51,523 --> 02:25:53,855
Who is it? ls PJ next to you?

2095
02:25:54,025 --> 02:25:57,517
Tell him, l'm going to rape Sindhu.

2096
02:25:58,029 --> 02:26:00,190
PJ, it seems he'll rape Sindhu.

2097
02:26:00,365 --> 02:26:03,198
Not him, l'm going rape her.
Super again.

2098
02:26:03,368 --> 02:26:05,529
lt seems he'll do it.
- Give me.

2099
02:26:07,705 --> 02:26:11,197
PJ, in every story hero
wins in the end,

2100
02:26:11,376 --> 02:26:13,207
l'm winning in this story also,

2101
02:26:13,378 --> 02:26:14,538
That's what l'm telling you.

2102
02:26:14,712 --> 02:26:18,204
There are no ifs and buts, only action!

2103
02:26:19,384 --> 02:26:22,217
What is he saying?
- He means business.

2104
02:26:22,387 --> 02:26:23,718
Thanks.

2105
02:26:26,057 --> 02:26:26,546
But is rape necessary?

2106
02:26:26,724 --> 02:26:28,624
Today or tomorrow,
rape is the only answer.

2107
02:26:29,894 --> 02:26:31,725
Ammiraju, have a blast!

2108
02:26:38,570 --> 02:26:40,902
lt started like that...
- What?

2109
02:26:49,414 --> 02:26:50,904
Safe?
- The girl is safe.

2110
02:26:51,082 --> 02:26:52,572
l asked if brother is safe.

2111
02:26:52,750 --> 02:26:54,411
Brother? He's a tiger.

2112
02:26:55,587 --> 02:26:57,578
He doesn't know the real matter.

2113
02:26:58,089 --> 02:26:59,579
Ammiraju has come.

2114
02:27:02,260 --> 02:27:04,421
Wait there, l'll kill you.

2115
02:27:05,096 --> 02:27:07,257
Anyway rape is over,
why this chase now?

2116
02:27:07,432 --> 02:27:09,764
l asked for Sindhu,
will you bring this damn thing?

2117
02:27:10,435 --> 02:27:12,266
lsn't she the lady you wanted?
- She's not a lady at all!

2118
02:27:15,106 --> 02:27:17,438
Catch him...catch him...

2119
02:27:20,612 --> 02:27:22,773
Shall we go to watch a film?
- We saw one just now.

2120
02:27:22,947 --> 02:27:24,107
lt's good, right?
- So what?

2121
02:27:24,282 --> 02:27:26,443
Let's watch again.
- Again?

2122
02:27:26,618 --> 02:27:28,108
Good films don't come again and again.

2123
02:27:28,286 --> 02:27:29,275
Then, let's watch.

2124
02:27:32,123 --> 02:27:37,117
One minute, thanks for giving your
precious time to watch this film.

2125
02:27:37,295 --> 02:27:37,954
