12
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:40,344

13
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,471
so thought I call you and ask.

14
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:43,536
What?

15
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:45,783
I mean...

16
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,513
You thought of callin'
but didn't think of what to say?

17
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:51,021
No, I thought that...

18
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:53,348
What do you think on spectacles?

19
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,518
I...

20
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,026
Do you have a problem in spectacles?

21
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:14,943
Speak, speak to me.

22
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,106
Uh...

23
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,375
Actually...

24
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,383
I want to do friendship with you.

25
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:22,444
What? You won't want me?

26
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,613
No.

27
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:24,885
No?

28
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:27,824
I mean, yes, we can.

29
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:29,587
Sure?

30
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,185
Hello?

31
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:34,559
Yes.

32
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,405
Do you like food?

33
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,116
On Chawl?

34
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,383

35
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,785
What kind of food?

36
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:06,792
All kinds.

37
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,900
Look, I just count to five.

38
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,438
If you can name my favorite food,

39
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,235
you may take me out for dinner.

40
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,802
If not, don't call me again.

41
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,043
Understood?

42
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,342
1...

43
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,375
2...

44
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,245
3...

45
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,416

00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,019
Pav Bhaji.

47
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,628
I'm getting married in 2 months.

48
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:28,977
Arranged marriage?

49
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:14,934
What happened?

50
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:16,835
Did you hear that?

51
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,170
Hear what?

52
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,016
This?
A rat...

53
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:29,918
Trying to scare me?

54
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:42,428
What is it?

55
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,203
Should I throw them away?
No.

56
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:35,689
Don't get married...

57
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,163
No Shaurya. That's not
how things work.

58
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,721
Marry me.

59
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:43,722
Yes. Marry me.

60
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,360
Are you crazy?
Why?

61
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:46,592
Why?

62
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,401
How is it possible?

63
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,101
Why not? Marry me.

64
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:51,871
And then we move in here?

65
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:52,932
Of course not

66
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,207
We'll shill someplace else...
I'll get us a new home.

67
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:59,408
Shaurya, we can't afford it.

68
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,380
I'll arrange for something.

69
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,681
No Shaurya, it can't happen.
This is not some...

70
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,916
Noorie, everything will be fine.
Please marry me...

71
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,724
I'm leaving in two days...

72
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,419
I'll find a house tomorrow...

73
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:11,723
We can't...

74
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,230
Noorie tell me one thing.

75
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,059
Do you love me?

76
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,595
Yes I do, I love you.

77
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:19,898
That's it. That's all we need.

78
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,661
I love you.

79
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,374
It'll be our own home.

80
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,784
A one room kitchen type...

81
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:41,816
I don't have much of a budget now,
around 15 or so...

82
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,091
Once I get my salary
I'll be able to afford more.

83
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,423
Please sir. Try...

84
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,070
Please help me a little, Sir.

85
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,966
It's not possible in 15000.

86
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,573
I'll give you more later.
After a month?

87
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,771
A one room kitchen costs 20000.
You'll find nothing for 15000...

88
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,312
Not in this area...

89
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,409
Somewhere close by...

90
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,417
Not possible.

91
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:07,781
It's quite urgent...

92
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,815
Urgent or not, it's just not possible.

93
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:12,044
Fifteen?

94
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,080
I'll get my salary in two weeks.
but for now...

95
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,286
Then come back in two weeks.
Can't do it in 15000

96
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:19,420
It's really urgent...
I'm sure with your help it will happen

97
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:20,863

98
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,161
Today. This evening...
Today?

99
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,758
That's why it's really urgent.

100
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:26,298
Please sir...

101
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,100
Do you have the deposit?

102
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,776
I don't have it right now
but as soon as I get my salary...

103
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,971
You don't have the deposit amount;
You have a budget of only 15000

104
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,810
and you need the apartment today...
Not going to happen.

105
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,748
I'm getting married so that's -

106
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,080
Don't get married.

107
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,180
Sir please...
Not possible

108
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:45,277

111
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,595
Hey there...

112
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,311
Are you looking for a flat?
Yes.

113
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,905
I'll get you one for 15000.

114
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,309

115
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:16,410
Come. There's no issue...

116
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,815
ls there a problem with this flat?

117
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,293
No problem at all.

118
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:27,160
You can live there for 3 months.
No one will say anything.

119
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,962
It's a new flat.

120
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,058
New?
Yes.

121
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,010
This is the building.

122
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,108
Come.

123
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,784
Uncle!

124
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,157
He's almost deaf.

125
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,423
Is the building empty?

126
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:05,363
It's been ready for 2 years...

127
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,930
but there's some issue with the lease.

128
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:11,074
A court case.
So no occupancy certificate yet.

129
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,771
But that's not a problem.
You can stay here comfortably.

130
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,911
This is a broker's flat.

131
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,845
He bought it but never visits.
We guys hang out here.

132
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,318
He won't have a problem?

133
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,820
No problem at all.

134
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,788
He never comes here.
I look alter everything.

135
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:31,286
Water comes in the morning...

136
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:32,988
There's electricity for 24 hours...

137
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,464
There's a TV, Fridge, AC.

138
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,234
You're sure there won't be any problem?
No problem at all...

139
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,568
If there is, I'm here.

140
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:51,703
What happened?

141
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,407
Nothing. A little stuck.

142
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,553
Is this the right key?
Yes.

143
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,694
This is the hall...

144
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,055
The sun rises there...

145
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,325
TV!

146
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,092
This is the kitchen...

147
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,733
There's a Fridge and heater.

148
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:25,977
This is your 2nd bedroom
with an attached bathroom.

149
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,060
The other bathroom.

150
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:53,366
The electricity has tripped.
I'll just step out to fix it.

151
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,712
I'm going.

152
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,552
Where?

153
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,782
Home. Some urgent work.

154
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,189
Most Important thing...

155
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,125
Never give up

156
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,193
Adventure is not about
what happens out there,

157
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,265
is about what happens...

158
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:23,862
In here.

159
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,070
The brave survive.

160
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,133
The weak, they due.

161
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,970
This is Hawk McNab signing off
from 'The World of the Wild'.

162
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,103
Shit!

163
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,479
Shit man!

164
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:16,164

187
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:37,621
Thank you.

188
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:41,220
Mr. Shaurya I'd like to give you some
good news, you have won 2 movie tickets.

189
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:43,665
Just please send the number fast.

190
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:44,996
Thank you.

191
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:46,558
Idiot...

192
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:00,175
Key maker!

193
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,219
I need the number for a key maker.

194
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:05,380
I mean, could you send one over?

195
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,583
Do you need I make
a key or break a lock?

196
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,250
The lock is stuck.

197
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:12,386
It's broken from inside
and the key is on the outside.

198
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,954
The the key is on the outside,
we'll have to break the lock.

199
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:17,227
Yes you have to break the lock.
Please send someone.

200
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,597
Which area are you in?

201
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:22,366
This is in Prabhadevi.
Where exactly?

202
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,069
Near Siddhivinayak...

203
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,103
Yes, Siddhivinayak!

204
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:31,881
No... No... No...

205
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:10,041
Shit!

206
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,603
Watchman...

207
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,172
Watchman...

208
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:16,780
Hello watchman!

209
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:20,354
Watchman...

210
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:25,120
Hello...

211
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,565
Anybody there?

212
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,306
Help please...

213
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:47,949
Anybody?

214
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,717
Hello...

215
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,187
Hey you!

216
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,456
Hello...

217
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:33,763
Hello...

218
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:36,095
Hello...

219
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,425
Up here!

220
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,331
Here!

221
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:45,876
Hey... I'm here.
Here...

222
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,943
Hello...

223
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,458
Watchman...

224
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,103
Hello...

225
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,540
Hello...

226
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:03,113
Hello red shirt...

227
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:05,578
Hello...

228
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:15,358
Uncle!

229
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:17,425
Hello...

230
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:20,993
Hello...

231
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,036
Hello...

232
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,153
Help...

233
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:18,286
Help...

234
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:25,126
Help...

235
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:32,758
Watchman...

236
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:34,626
Watchman...

237
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:37,461
Hello...

238
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:38,701
Hello watchman!

239
00:34:13,185 --> 00:34:14,562
Watchman...

240
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:36,182
Watchman! Watchman!

241
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,187
Watchman...

242
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,613
Hello... Here...

243
00:40:05,303 --> 00:40:06,577
Please...

244
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,865
Down there... down...

245
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04,766
Hello...

246
00:50:48,479 --> 00:50:49,651
Hello.

247
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:52,424
Hello?
Yes

248
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:54,428
Is this Swarg Apartment?

249
00:50:54,652 --> 00:50:55,357
What?

250
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:57,556
Is this Swarg Apartment?
Yes.

251
00:50:57,922 --> 00:50:58,922
Does anyone live here?

252
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:00,156
No one lives here.

253
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:02,495
No one?

254
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:07,370
I've been working here for 2 years.
Nobody lives here.

255
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:08,431
Please leave.

256
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:38,632
Anyone here?

257
00:58:35,913 --> 00:58:37,017
Eat!

258
00:59:06,677 --> 00:59:10,489
The evolution of homo sapien's
is a truly remarkable event.

259
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:14,518
As we know from Charles Darwin, it's
all about survival of the fittest...

260
00:59:14,618 --> 00:59:17,531
Now what would I do if
I was exploring the wilds...

261
00:59:17,621 --> 00:59:19,032
And I'd run out of supplies?

262
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:21,762
Say I was in the Sahara Desert
or the Amazon rainforest...

263
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:23,667
or even trapped in a small room...

264
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:26,703
What would I do for that
vital source of nourishment?

265
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:27,832
I'll tell you

266
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:28,898
A cockroach!

267
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:31,679
Now this little fella
is packed full of protein.

268
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:34,511
Not only that, it can survive
for 1 month without food.

269
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,476
So what do I suggest?

270
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:41,011
I suggest taking this, putting
it on your tongue and...

271
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:47,588
You've never eaten chicken before?
Never.

272
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:48,650
Why not?

273
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:51,731
No one eats it in my family.

274
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:53,688
Why?

275
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:56,303
It's against our religion.

276
01:09:57,627 --> 01:10:00,403
But I have religious friends.
they eat non-vegetarian food.

277
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:04,676
It's their bad karma.
They'll pay for it some day.

278
01:10:05,168 --> 01:10:07,648
So I'll also have bad karma
because I'm eating chicken?

279
01:10:08,104 --> 01:10:09,640
I'm not saying that...

280
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:14,913
You're a nice girl so
it will balance itself out.

281
01:10:14,978 --> 01:10:17,822
And you're a bad guy
but you don't eat chicken...

282
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:20,325
so that balances itself out.

283
01:10:22,118 --> 01:10:24,120
Are you one of those people?

284
01:10:26,089 --> 01:10:28,035
That support the beef ban?

285
01:10:28,358 --> 01:10:29,462
Yes.

286
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:30,662
How is that okay?

287
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:33,673
Shouldn't it be about freedom
of choice? It's my decision.

288
01:10:33,863 --> 01:10:37,640
Who are you to tell me
what I can or cannot eat?

289
01:10:37,934 --> 01:10:41,040
You or anyone for that matter.
I'm not forcing anyone.

290
01:10:42,539 --> 01:10:45,019
I'm just being honest.
I don't like it.

291
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:47,179
It's wrong.
Why do you have to kill to eat?

292
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:49,553
It's not wrong...

293
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,654
Animals kill each other
for food in the wild.

294
01:10:53,717 --> 01:10:55,162
Because...
We are also animals.

295
01:10:55,218 --> 01:10:58,028
Have you ever seen a
lion eating boiled potatoes?

296
01:10:58,121 --> 01:11:00,931
They can't. But we can eat this.
Yes, but we can also eat this.

297
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:02,001
That's wrong.
How is it wrong?

298
01:11:02,025 --> 01:11:03,902
Is it okay to kill someone for food?

299
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,064
To take a life?

300
01:11:05,161 --> 01:11:07,334
Have you seen videos
of animals being slaughtered?

301
01:11:07,564 --> 01:11:08,564
That's okay?

302
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:11,838
If I fancy eating a
family member of yours...

303
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:12,902
Would you let me?

304
01:11:13,069 --> 01:11:14,241
They'll defend themselves.

305
01:11:14,304 --> 01:11:18,184
Precisely. Kill animals because they
can't speak...

306
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:20,846
Just because it's yummy.

307
01:11:21,478 --> 01:11:23,651
It's a bit strange, isn't it?

308
01:12:43,293 --> 01:12:45,705
Why... Why?

309
01:12:46,062 --> 01:12:47,336
Why?

310
01:13:36,246 --> 01:13:37,919
Want to hear a joke?

311
01:13:39,182 --> 01:13:42,288
A group of rats were hanging out...

312
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:45,761
when a sexy elephant passed by...

313
01:13:46,489 --> 01:13:48,560
You know what one rat said?

314
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:52,737
36,000 - 24,000 - 36,000

315
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,639
Thank you... Thank you... Thank you...

316
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:03,014
Welcome to "Chat with Rat"

317
01:14:03,372 --> 01:14:05,010
Are you all listening?

318
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:08,686
Can you hear me?

319
01:14:09,579 --> 01:14:11,081
Because no else can hear me.

320
01:14:11,414 --> 01:14:12,484
I'll show you...

321
01:14:13,249 --> 01:14:15,286
Watchman...

322
01:14:52,755 --> 01:14:54,496
What's the plan?

323
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,640
This door won't break,
not in this lifetime.

324
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:01,905
Can't jump from the window.

325
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:06,241
No point in shouting.
Everyone out there is deaf...

326
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:09,047
Or doesn't give a damn.

327
01:15:11,541 --> 01:15:15,114
The balcony on the 30th floor
doesn't have a grill...

328
01:15:16,613 --> 01:15:18,889
But to get there we'll have to
cut through this one.

329
01:15:19,916 --> 01:15:21,725
And the only tools we have...

330
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:23,795
A useless fan blade.

331
01:15:24,187 --> 01:15:25,393
A tube-light starter.

332
01:15:25,488 --> 01:15:27,058
A metal plate from the AC.

333
01:15:27,557 --> 01:15:29,036
And our pan.

334
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:32,497
If we succeed...

335
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:35,971
we still have to climb down 5 floors
without any safety gear.

336
01:15:38,234 --> 01:15:41,408
One small mistake and...

337
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:43,973
Watchman...

338
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:47,278
The apartment downstairs
may not even be open...

339
01:15:47,343 --> 01:15:49,084
That's the risk.

340
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:51,752
But there's no option.

341
01:15:54,417 --> 01:15:56,488
Soon we will run out of water...

342
01:15:57,086 --> 01:15:59,760
You'll sneak away through
some pipe or drain...

343
01:16:00,156 --> 01:16:01,635
I'll die here.

344
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:18,766
I don't want to die here...

345
01:18:19,562 --> 01:18:21,371
Come what may, I won't die here.

346
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:26,570
I want to get out...

347
01:18:26,636 --> 01:18:30,379
Eat Pav Bhaji
swimming in butter.

348
01:18:32,375 --> 01:18:34,048
Go to the beach and swim...

349
01:18:34,544 --> 01:18:36,114
Eat sweet ice candy.

350
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:42,253
Travel in a crowded train.

351
01:18:42,685 --> 01:18:44,255
Sweaty...

352
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:46,389
Stinky...

353
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:50,469
I want to get pushed around.

354
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:53,563
Fight with the conductor.

355
01:18:54,597 --> 01:18:55,769
I want to brawl.

356
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:12,083
Go to office.

357
01:19:14,517 --> 01:19:16,053
Meet Noorie!

358
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:18,596
Get married!

359
01:19:20,856 --> 01:19:24,360
Have many baby Noorie's and Shaurya's?

360
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:28,197
I don't want to die here.

361
01:20:54,650 --> 01:20:56,095
Go...

362
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:06,332
The quote goes,

363
01:36:06,394 --> 01:36:09,534
"When you look in an abyss,
the abyss also looks into you..."

364
01:36:09,597 --> 01:36:10,598
But what I say is...

365
01:36:10,699 --> 01:36:13,737
"When abyss looks at you funny,
punch the abyss in the face...!"

366
01:36:13,835 --> 01:36:16,907
I in episode, we're exploring
the Indonesian jungles,

367
01:36:17,005 --> 01:36:20,543
This really Is the heart of darkness
where people fear to tread.

368
01:36:21,042 --> 01:36:23,613
And those that do,
never come back alive.

369
01:36:24,045 --> 01:36:27,185
In jungle we're going to
find giant lizards...

370
01:36:27,382 --> 01:36:29,157
Like the size of my fist...

371
01:36:29,551 --> 01:36:32,896
Alligators, the size of buses
and birds the size of cars.

372
01:36:33,188 --> 01:36:35,532
Are you ready format?
Because let me tell you...

373
01:36:35,590 --> 01:36:38,298
What you don't know
is going to get you killed.
