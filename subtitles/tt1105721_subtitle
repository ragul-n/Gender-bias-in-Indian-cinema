His wife is a witness to that.

39

You shouId accept the crime
and go to jaiI.

40
00:05:57,156 --> 00:06:00,853
-But I didn't kiII him.
-That's why he's paying you.

Oh little! Rainy tears

Live like a selfless lamp!

59
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:48,326

Why do you torture me?

61
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,161
Who knows whether
your mother is aIive or dead?

62
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:13,851
Don't worry seeing your problems.

63

00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,573
-So, we want to ceIebrate

-You shouId do a smaII favour.

70
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,777

00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,200
lf anyone opposes us,
we will tear their skin.

76
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,600
Sir! Give him onIy one chance.

77
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:34,629
-Where have you pIanned to do that?
-At their ceII.

78
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,208
If you agree, he wiII go there
whiIe you cIose the ceII.

79
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,437
They are 4 peopIe,

00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,977
-It'II create probIems.
-They can't create a probIem.

00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,013

82
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,175
As per ruIes, we shouIdn't open
the doors untiI morning.

83
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,845
My buddy can hit them twice.

84
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,054
Carry on.

85
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,396
Buddy! JaiIor has agreed.

86
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,035
He said not to show yourseIf.

87
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:10,742
You have to start it before dusk
and the ceII shouId vibrate.

88
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,969
Who are you?

89
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,111
Why do you stare at me?

90
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,623
How dare you quarreI with us?

91
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:49,686
Leave me.

92
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,188
He is kiIIing me.

93
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:57,258
Leave me.

94
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,169
What?

95
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:10,805
Come.

96
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:25,753
I was waiting for 12 years
to come out of jaiI.

97
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:29,123
But I had faced someone
Iike you and hit him

98
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:30,996
And I'II extend my time here.

99
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,401
Why do you torture me?

100
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,512
I'II be here tiII they
open the ceII in the morning.

101
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:47,015
I am ready to fight with you anytime.

102
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,613
Ok?

103
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,439
I'II pierce your eyes.

104
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,141
Why these wounds?
What happened?

105
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,951
-Who hit you? -We sIipped
and feII down in the bathroom.

106
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:21,842
-ShouId I beIieve this?
-It's true sir.

107
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,716
We just sIipped down sir.
PIease Ieave us.

108
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,528
Bye sir.

109
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,892
Do you think that
I can't find who hit them?

110
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,068
I thought you were a nice person.

111
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,937
What is this game?

112
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,638
I don't think that
I am a good person.

113
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,743
It'II take time
to prove to be a good person.

114
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,277
But no one expect good quaIities
from a bad person

115
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:51,712
That's enough sir.

116
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:55,149
I am watching you for Iong.
Don't I know about you?

117
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,315
Enough of your jaiI Iife here.

118
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,721
-Don't come here again.
-Ok sir.

119
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:03,889
Bye sir.

120
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,931
Buddy! I think Hyderabad
has deveIoped too much.

121
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,667
Where shouId we go now?

122
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,931
I want to see my mom.

123
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,269
-Is this the correct street?
-Yes.

124
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,443
-Are you sure?
-Yes. But it changed a Iot.

125
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,516
I knew weII.
That pIace shouId be around here.

126
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,949
There was my schooI
and here was a tempIe.

127
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,556
-A tempIe in this pIace?
-Yes.

128
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:36,786
My house shouId be here onIy.

129
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,827
-HeIIo sir?
-Whom do you want?

130
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,694
Madam! Here was an oId house.

131
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:43,027
Lakshmamma Iived in that house.
Do you know about her?

132
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,659
No chiId. But we buiIt
this house 10 years ago.

133
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,965
Her husband was an auto driver.
He is dead.

134
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,401
She Iived aIone there.

135
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,100
-Do you know where she is now?
-I don't know.

136
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,567
-What do you want?
-Where is my mom?

137
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,373
-What?
-Where is my mom?

138
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:35,175
-When did you get reIeased
from jaiI? -Today.

139
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:39,190
I went home. But there was
no house or my mom.

140
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,057
Where is my mom?

141
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:45,725
What you did for the sake
of your mother was a waste.

142
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:49,760
Your mother died after
an year you went to jaiI.

143
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:54,938
He spent a Iot of money
on your mother but of no use.

144
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:59,276
I didn't want to teII you about
this incident at that tender age..

145
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,911
So I didn't teII you.

146
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:05,806
PIease forgive me.

147
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,852
If you suddenIy teII this
that you don't want to go there,.

148
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,360
..then what shouId
I teII the TraveI Agency?

149
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,099
Why didn't you teII this before?

150
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,325
-What do you want to do?
-I don't know.

151
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:00,403
There is a job in a company
known to me in Bangkok.

152
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,706
The boy who is supposed to
go there suddenIy says he can't.

153
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,273
WiII you go there?

154
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,480
-I'II go sir.

155
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,809
-No sir.
-Then do one thing.

156
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,418
If any poIice officer recommends you,
you'II get the passport so soon.

157
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,383
We know the JaiI superintendent weII.

158
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:19,581
-It's enough.
-I'II try sir.

159
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:25,989
Who are you?
How dare you hit my vehicIe?

160
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:30,185
-Come out. -Wait.
-Don't annoy me.

161
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,853
She is a girI. If she is a girI,
wiII you be siIent?

162
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,528
Hey girI! You don't know about me.

163
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,736
-UncIe! -Is it ok to you,
I'II Ieave it? -Come, Iet's go.

164
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:41,169
-is she pretty?
-you come.

165
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:45,834
-You dashed his heart so gently.
-Keep quiet.

166
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:53,278
Pedestrians on the road feeI
jeaIous of guys in cars.

167
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:54,811
They are Iike that.

168
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,611
If a cycIist hits a scooter,
the motorist is bIamed.

169
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,279
If a scooter hits a car,

00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:22,410
Poor ones aIways confront

178
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:26,115

00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:36,113
Who bothers?

503
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:39,520
Is she a Iady?
She is a Sankini (eviI) in Iady disguise.

504
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:40,916
What does it mean?

505
00:57:41,324 --> 00:57:45,192
It's caIIed a type of fish.
It kiIIs human.

506
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:48,492
I want that fish for my dinner.
Cook it.

507
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:50,792
She Iooks so pretty sir.

508
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:56,763
It's simpIy superb sir.

509
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:04,178
He aIways boasts about her
when they got into the boat.

510
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:06,678
She is sneezing.. coughing and bending.

511
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:08,976
Seeing this girI other girIs
aIso got spoiIt.

512
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:11,676
She is arrogant because she is rich.

513
00:58:11,855 --> 00:58:14,085
Why do we have them in the boat?

514
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:15,822
Because they are rich, right?

515
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:18,752
If they are not rich,
I'II kiII them myseIf instead of you.

516
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:29,627
Is this a soup?

517
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:32,200
Is this a soup?

518
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:34,537
I want to pour it on your face.

519
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:38,638
Wait madam.

520
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:40,645
You want to pour
this soup on his face, right?

521
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:42,978
Pour it on my head.

522
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:46,981
Pour it.

523
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,624
Don't you know what to add in the soup?

524
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:56,727
You..
You are fussing too much.

525
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:57,889
Move aside sir.

526
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:03,662
I shouId throw you into the sea.

527
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,181
What did you teII your name is?

528
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:17,810
What?

529
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:36,663
When l watched you
from a long distance..

530
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:41,276
l enjoyed a lot,
but now it's not like that.

531
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:45,004
You get angry for everything

532
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:49,617
Hoping to stop
our friendship now.

533
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:53,311
Why are you so arrogant?
Oh beauty!

534
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:57,960
lf you keep throwing airs,
how can l bear it?

535
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:01,653
l expected so much and
l loved you very much.

536
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:06,062
lf you behave like this,
l am irritated

537
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,371
l lived for you..

538
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:17,205
l gave my heart to you.

539
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:19,040
l've fallen in love with you.

540
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:21,273
Change your behaviour.

541
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:24,413
Oh girl! My mind feels happy.

542
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:28,490
Oh my sweet heart!

543
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:58,781
Why has he come with a Iady gang?

544
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:05,559
Are you fine?

545
01:01:20,576 --> 01:01:22,567
-They are massaging them superbIy.
-Let's do Iike that.

546
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:25,643
They wiII kiII us.
We can just watch them.

547
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:36,256
-Do you want strong massage?
-No, I want soft.

548
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:41,724
Come.

549
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:43,831
I want this massage.

550
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:36,317
Don't go to the edge.
You wiII faII into the sea and die.

551
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:39,350
They wiII faII and die.
You'II take the dead bodies in this boat.

552
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,557
Give me a Iist with your compIaints.

553
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:42,850
We'II coIIect the money,
making a biII for that.

554
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:45,219
What do you think of
Indo-Bangkok Company?

555
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:50,459
HeIIo!
Come here.

556
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:53,792
-do you have beers?
-Yes.

557
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:56,561

559
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:06,142
If you want something speciaI,
I'II mix butter miIk in beer.

560
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:08,909
He is Iying.
Nothing shouId be mixed in beer.

561
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,609
Why did you Iie to me?

562
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:28,333
Their bodies are Iike sponges.

563
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:31,266
I won't forget you in my Iife.

564
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:06,506
Why do you stare at me?

565
01:04:08,077 --> 01:04:09,567
Are you drunk?

566
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:15,883
If I see you drinking again,
I'II kiII you.

567
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:21,615
They caught us niceIy.

568
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:23,482
I'II take her with me.
You take her with you.

569
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:25,991
-BabbIu!You Take her with you.
-one girI remains.

570
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:29,894
If you have bad thoughts

571
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:31,997
-Take them to their bedrooms.
-we toId the same sir. -Take them.

572
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:33,065
Get them up.

573
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:36,096
What do they eat,
they are so heavy?

574
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:42,337
Charan! There is a rumor outside
that you Iove this girI deepIy.

575
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:46,411
Now she is in your hands.
How do you feeI now?

576
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:49,179
I feIt happy seeing her from a distance.

577
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:53,654
But now I am not feeIing anything.

578
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:58,427
I just hoId her,
but there is no feeIing in my mind.

579
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:03,593
Look at her face.

580
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:06,025
Once she was very cute.

581
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:09,467
Now I hate to see her face.

582
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,301
She is arrogant and proud.

583
01:05:14,844 --> 01:05:17,005
AIong with she has drinking habit.

584
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:25,210
Move aside.
I'II Iay her down in her room.

585
01:05:28,891 --> 01:05:32,019
I have never seen
Iike a 31st night in my Iife.

586
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:39,791

01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:48,472

01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:56,841
-Come, Iet's go.
-Sir, Sanjana hasn't got up yet.

591
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,148
We wiII come back before she gets up.

592
01:05:59,322 --> 01:06:01,256
-Then Ok.
-Charan!Take care of her.

593
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:02,752
Don't make her get up.
She wants to sIeep for sometime.

594
01:06:02,858 --> 01:06:05,827
-What show is here without me knowing?
-Come, I'II show you.

595
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:12,028
ShouId we get beIIy dancers

596
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:17,036
Hey boy! Get me a cup of coffee.

01:06:20,109 --> 01:06:23,601
Why do you bring it without
Me compIeting my words?

01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:27,206
You shouId bring

599
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:29,912
Where are the others?

600

They have gone out and
wouId be back in an hour.

601
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:35,649
Prepare fresh coffee and
get me after 2 minutes.

602
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:37,351
Go away.

603
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:55,368
If any girI comes to Bangkok,
I'II tease her.

604
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:57,746
But how can I Iet you tease me?

605
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:00,004
That day I missed you.

606
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:11,987
TeII me, what happened?

607
01:12:28,043 --> 01:12:30,534
Come and drive this.

608
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:35,047
You fought and saved me as a hero.
Do something.

609
01:12:35,317 --> 01:12:36,113
Move on.

610
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:42,717
Have you hit me?

611
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:45,992
-How dare you hit me?
-Iike this.

612
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:52,065
Shut up.
I'II kiII you here.

613
01:12:52,434 --> 01:12:56,734
Shut up and sit.

614
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:09,578
Don't cry.

615
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:28,429
Dear!

616
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:29,526
Where are you?

617
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:30,827
Search there.

618
01:13:37,379 --> 01:13:39,279
-have you seen her?
-No sir.

619
01:13:39,615 --> 01:13:40,843
She is not to be seen anywhere.

620
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:43,015
-caII your boy once.
-Wait, He is caIIing.

621
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:45,309
I am trying but his mobiIe
is out of reach.

622
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:46,445
Or I don't know whether
he has switched off the mobiIe.

623
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:48,453
Where has he taken her?

624
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:19,777
Wait.

625
01:14:20,055 --> 01:14:20,885
It won't go,
if you say move.

626
01:14:21,223 --> 01:14:22,247
We shouId move our hands
in the water to go there.

627
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:24,318
Otherwise we have to swim to reach there.

628
01:14:59,628 --> 01:15:00,424
Why do you shout?

629
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:02,127
Nobody is here.

630
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:09,199
-Say sorry.
-for what?

631
01:15:09,571 --> 01:15:11,539
you hit me Iast night, right?
That's why.

632
01:15:18,747 --> 01:15:22,342
If possibIe, I'II hit you once again
but I won't say sorry.

633
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:29,583
CaII him.
I am ready.

634
01:15:36,565 --> 01:15:37,361
ShouId I say something?

635
01:15:37,799 --> 01:15:39,733
I am resigning this job now.

636
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,360
What can you do?

637
01:15:48,777 --> 01:15:49,641
I have doubt on your boy.

638
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:51,706
He wouId kidnap her for money.

639
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:52,844
What happened to her?

640
01:15:53,181 --> 01:15:54,739
TeII me. Where have you hidden her?

641
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:56,875
What are you taIking?
He is not Iike that.

642
01:15:57,185 --> 01:15:58,675
We don't know how much
she's troubIing him

643
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:01,287
-she is a kiIIer fish?
-kiIIer fish?

644
01:16:01,857 --> 01:16:03,051
Is she a kiIIer fish?

645
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:05,292
What do you think of her?

646
01:16:05,594 --> 01:16:07,619
If I make a movie..
you know what titIe wiII I seIect?

647
01:16:07,863 --> 01:16:08,727
'My dear girI is my Iife.'

648
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:09,927
'For the sake of my dear.'

649
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:12,565
If you taIk too much..
Answer is my dear.

650
01:16:12,935 --> 01:16:15,199
How dare you abuse her?

651
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:16,862
Stop it sir.

652
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:18,867
My boss is caIIing..
I don't know what to teII him

653
01:16:19,942 --> 01:16:22,035
What is my daughter doing?

654
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:23,869
She is sIeeping inside.
ShouId I wake her up?

655
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:25,478
-Wait.
-ShouId I wake her up?

656
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:26,908
TeII me, shouId I wake her up?

657
01:16:27,182 --> 01:16:28,114
Let her sIeep.

658
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:31,747
If he caIIs again,
don't know what to teII him

659
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:40,455
What are you doing?

660
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:49,501

You'II die.

666

If you survive from it,
you can't speak.

667
01:17:35,784 --> 01:17:37,274
I toId without knowingIy.?

668
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:45,255
Don't cry.

669
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,759
Oh God! I can't consoIe them.

670
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:49,486
Don't cry! I feeI Iike crying
seeing your sorrow.

671
01:17:52,534 --> 01:17:54,263
I am trying to find her.

672

I shouId kiII him.

673
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:17,053

01:28:18,893 --> 01:28:23,728
Who bothers about her?
She is eviI but not dear

760
01:28:25,066 --> 01:28:27,557
I am fed up working for her.

761
01:28:27,935 --> 01:28:29,527

You idiot! Are you her father?

765
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:41,714
Is this how you bring her up?

766
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:43,883

01:28:44,519 --> 01:28:47,215
Do you aIone have daughter?

768
01:28:47,588 --> 01:28:50,955
Then, nobody has daughters.

769
01:28:51,559 --> 01:28:54,027
Did she come from heaven?

770
01:28:54,462 --> 01:28:55,895
Was she born from nowhere?

771
01:28:56,764 --> 01:28:58,823
ShouId I take care of her?

772
01:28:59,701 --> 01:29:03,296
Eversince she was born,
I became restIess with tension.

773
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:07,471
And I suffered with BP and Sugar.

774

If either you or your girI

775
01:29:17,385 --> 01:29:18,750
Have you seen it?
This is a new angIe.

776
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,054
Who knows about one's frustration?

777
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:22,687
His move name is 'Dear is my Iife.'

778
01:29:23,124 --> 01:29:24,182
But it is his inner thought.

779
01:29:24,459 --> 01:29:26,893
You shouIdn't beIieve anyone,
with just his outward taIk.

780
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:34,198
My stomach is paining.

01:30:54,916 --> 01:30:55,905
It is the pain in Iife.

798
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:58,013
Hunger makes many mistakes.

799
01:30:58,352 --> 01:31:00,115
Understand it.

800
01:31:00,688 --> 01:31:02,519

01:34:27,094 --> 01:34:28,288
Search for his passport.

850
01:34:28,696 --> 01:34:30,721
Find out about him when and how
did he come and why has he come?

851
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:33,598
Find out the traveI agency
which booked his ticket.

852
01:34:35,336 --> 01:34:37,429
He came by Venkateswara traveIs agency.

853
01:34:45,479 --> 01:34:48,346
I have never massaged anyone Iike this.

854
01:34:49,784 --> 01:34:52,150
I have not taken massage Iike this.

855
01:34:55,956 --> 01:34:57,253
We got this passport from his room.

856
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:00,059
I can find aII his detaiI with this.

857
01:35:00,394 --> 01:35:01,952
Take this and find his detaiIs

858
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:04,395
Both my daughter's and
his photo shouId be teIecasted...

859
01:35:04,498 --> 01:35:07,695
..in aII TV channeIs in
ThaiIand in 24 hours.

860
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:13,836
What happened?

861
01:35:19,313 --> 01:35:20,109
You Iook so pretty.

862
01:35:21,816 --> 01:35:22,874
Come.

863
01:35:24,485 --> 01:35:26,646
Come I say.

864
01:35:29,156 --> 01:35:30,180
Where are you going?

865
01:35:33,794 --> 01:35:35,785
Come.

866
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:56,580
Don't worry.

867
01:35:57,685 --> 01:35:58,879
I won't do anything.

868
01:36:00,421 --> 01:36:01,888
Do you know why I won't do?

869
01:36:03,557 --> 01:36:05,081
Because I Iike you.

870
01:36:05,926 --> 01:36:07,223
I Iiked you very much.

871
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:09,953
I Ioved you.

872
01:36:11,265 --> 01:36:13,426
Don't think this started in Bangkok.

873
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:17,036
It started Iong back

874
01:36:20,374 --> 01:36:22,035
Do you know where I saw you first?

875
01:36:27,214 --> 01:36:28,146
From that day onwards.

876
01:36:29,917 --> 01:36:31,942
I went behind you.

877
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:34,148
Wherever you go,
I wouId be there.

878
01:36:40,561 --> 01:36:42,085
invisibIe to you.

879
01:36:43,731 --> 01:36:45,722
I enjoyed seeing you from distance.

880
01:36:51,739 --> 01:36:54,207
I have come to your house
before I came here.

881
01:37:00,915 --> 01:37:02,542
You too saw me.

882
01:37:07,855 --> 01:37:09,982
I heard and feIt very happy
that you where coming here.

883
01:37:12,693 --> 01:37:16,720
But I started hating you after
seeing your behaviour.

884
01:37:17,698 --> 01:37:20,667
I hated your arrogance.

885
01:37:24,772 --> 01:37:26,899
I am not asking you to Iove me.

886
01:37:28,175 --> 01:37:29,437
Change your behaviour.

887
01:37:30,744 --> 01:37:32,575
Treat human as human.

888
01:37:34,081 --> 01:37:36,379
I wanted to teII you this.

889
01:38:09,383 --> 01:38:10,850
UsuaIIy she takes soup at this time.

890
01:38:13,487 --> 01:38:14,852
Dear!

891
01:38:18,826 --> 01:38:20,521
-are you worrying very much?
-Yes sir.

892
01:38:22,096 --> 01:38:23,290
TeII me the truth.

893
01:38:24,131 --> 01:38:26,429
You pIanned and
kidnapped her for money.

894
01:38:26,533 --> 01:38:27,557
Are you showing your innocence?

895
01:38:27,701 --> 01:38:29,066
No sir, I am a very good person.

896
01:38:29,169 --> 01:38:31,194
You are aII good peopIe but
I am onIy bad person. I agree.

897
01:38:31,305 --> 01:38:32,237
Let's settIe the deaI.

898
01:38:32,339 --> 01:38:35,365
TeII me, how many crores do you want?
But give me my daughter to me.

899
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:38,803
Sir! I didn't kidnap her.
but that Charan wouId have kidnapped her.

900
01:38:38,946 --> 01:38:42,040
-Why wouId He kidnap her?
-money makes to do anything.

901
01:38:43,417 --> 01:38:45,851
-Then, you said That He is a gem.
-I just thought

902
01:38:57,131 --> 01:38:58,029
Come with me.

903
01:39:22,356 --> 01:39:24,916
I know aII about you.

904
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:28,885
I won't forget January 5th.

905
01:39:29,697 --> 01:39:31,062
You too won't forget it.

906
01:39:31,532 --> 01:39:34,558
Because your mother died that day.

907
01:39:40,274 --> 01:39:42,936
your father Iiked you very much.

908
01:40:17,978 --> 01:40:22,711
Dear! l love you.
You are in my heart.

909
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:27,719
Won't l recognise
if you come before me?

910
01:40:47,307 --> 01:40:49,639
Nothing interesting
before love is disclosed..

911
01:40:49,743 --> 01:40:52,143
Later, it is full of surprises.

912
01:40:52,246 --> 01:40:54,612
lt is a dream before meeting each other..

913
01:40:54,715 --> 01:40:56,774
Later, it starts a new story.

914
01:40:56,884 --> 01:40:59,216
l am getting crazy.

915
01:40:59,319 --> 01:41:01,685
Some changes happen to me.

916
01:41:01,789 --> 01:41:05,486
lt makes me go forward
and disturb.

917
01:42:07,921 --> 01:42:13,018
Don't know it's a boon or a gift.

918
01:42:17,731 --> 01:42:22,566
Cloud turns as rain like you.

919
01:42:22,669 --> 01:42:25,001
Let's come close.

920
01:42:25,105 --> 01:42:27,767
Let's enjoy it.

921
01:42:28,275 --> 01:42:30,641
She giggled at me with her eyes.

922
01:42:30,744 --> 01:42:33,110
She laughed at me excitingly.

923
01:42:33,213 --> 01:42:37,149
She covered my heart.

924
01:42:37,651 --> 01:42:42,281
You drenched my body
with your sweat.

925
01:42:42,389 --> 01:42:44,619
She gets crazy.

926
01:42:44,725 --> 01:42:47,057
She yells with joy.

927
01:42:47,161 --> 01:42:49,493
When she moves over me..

928
01:42:49,596 --> 01:42:52,258
..my body becomes numb.

929
01:43:36,510 --> 01:43:41,072
Some strange eyes stare at you.

930
01:43:41,348 --> 01:43:46,183
Couldn't believe that you are with me.

931
01:43:46,286 --> 01:43:50,985
Truly, l am not like myself.

932
01:43:51,158 --> 01:43:55,993
You've changed me a lot.

933
01:43:56,530 --> 01:43:58,896
Don't know what happened.

934
01:43:58,999 --> 01:44:01,297
Couldn't get sleep.

935
01:44:01,401 --> 01:44:05,667
When you are with me..

936
01:44:05,872 --> 01:44:10,434
l become as a slave to this king.

937
01:44:10,544 --> 01:44:12,842
She gets anxious.

938
01:44:12,946 --> 01:44:15,346
She waits eagerly.

939
01:44:15,449 --> 01:44:17,747
She pulls me with her glance.

940
01:44:17,851 --> 01:44:20,513
She makes me to fulfill my desire.

941
01:44:20,621 --> 01:44:25,354
Oh dear! Don't know what happened later.

942
01:44:25,492 --> 01:44:30,225
Couldn't believe that,
you are in my heart.

943
01:44:30,330 --> 01:44:35,165
l was a Romeo then.
Now l am a lover boy.

944
01:44:35,269 --> 01:44:41,174
My dream has come true.
That's why this happiness.

945
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:55,854
What did you teII about him?
Was he a gem?

946
01:44:56,056 --> 01:44:57,489
-Yes sir,
-do you know who He is?

947
01:44:57,691 --> 01:45:00,660
He was in prison for 12 years.
He studied in reformation schooI?

948
01:45:00,794 --> 01:45:03,319
Are you having a gang
Of criminaIs in Bangkok?

949
01:45:04,298 --> 01:45:07,028
I've a doubt on these guys too.
From which prison have you come?

950
01:45:07,234 --> 01:45:08,667
CharIapaIIi or Musheerabad.
TeII me.

951
01:45:09,202 --> 01:45:12,865
-I'II kiII you.
-they are innocent. beIieve me sir.

952
01:45:16,243 --> 01:45:18,006
Book an heIicopter immediateIy and..

953
01:45:40,867 --> 01:45:42,630
-Don't caII them?
-Why? What happened?

954
01:45:43,103 --> 01:45:45,128
Maybe he is my father.

955
01:45:45,706 --> 01:45:48,106
I don't Iike to Ieave from here.

956
01:45:51,345 --> 01:45:53,677
My dad won't accept for our marriage.

957
01:45:54,481 --> 01:45:55,539
Let us stay here.

958
01:46:03,523 --> 01:46:05,457
I onIy Ioved you..

959
01:46:06,126 --> 01:46:08,060
..but I never knew that you Iove me too.

960
01:46:08,795 --> 01:46:10,592
I wanted to see you Iike that..

961
01:46:10,797 --> 01:46:12,230
I didn't think
to share my Iife with you.

962
01:46:14,935 --> 01:46:16,960
I shouId teII you about my past.

963
01:46:17,938 --> 01:46:19,633
You shouId know who I am.

964
01:46:22,442 --> 01:46:23,773
My mom..

965
01:46:26,146 --> 01:46:27,636
My father..

966
01:46:30,450 --> 01:46:31,883
And me..

967
01:46:46,566 --> 01:46:50,263
I was in the jaiI for 12 years
for my mother.

968
01:46:53,974 --> 01:46:56,067
After I got reIeased from the jaiI..

969
01:46:57,844 --> 01:46:59,436
..I got to know of my mother's death.

970
01:47:03,450 --> 01:47:09,252
My onIy aim is to avenge Mattu Bhai.

971
01:47:18,165 --> 01:47:21,259
I enquired about Mattu Bhai with
every criminaI in the jaiI.

972
01:47:21,401 --> 01:47:24,837
-Why do you bother about Mattu Bhai?
-I know about him weII.

973
01:47:25,038 --> 01:47:26,471
He became a big shot.

974
01:47:26,673 --> 01:47:32,111
His range is different.
He shifted overseas.

975
01:47:32,412 --> 01:47:36,746
I came to Bangkok for Mattu Bhai
not for a Iiving.

976
01:47:57,737 --> 01:48:01,503
He is here for sure. He changed as
a big shot in past 10 years.

977
01:48:10,183 --> 01:48:12,378
He is operating from Bangkok.

978
01:48:12,619 --> 01:48:14,849
He earned crores of money.

979
01:48:16,656 --> 01:48:20,183
Biku is his son.

980
01:48:20,827 --> 01:48:24,319
I thought to meet him
here with his son's heIp.

981
01:48:25,065 --> 01:48:29,297
MeanwhiIe, I knew that
he is coming to Bangkok.

982
01:48:29,669 --> 01:48:32,661
I waited.
I didn't sIeep for 18 days.

983
01:48:32,873 --> 01:48:36,809
I got a chance to meet him.
I've seen him.

984
01:50:05,298 --> 01:50:07,027
But he gave me a sIip

985
01:50:08,101 --> 01:50:09,466
It happened a month ago.

986
01:50:09,603 --> 01:50:12,629
Since then he didn't come to Bangkok.

987
01:50:12,806 --> 01:50:15,639
It's sure he'II die,
when he comes here.

988
01:50:16,776 --> 01:50:20,803
Either I'II die or
Be jaiIed in this process.

989
01:50:22,015 --> 01:50:25,644
Forget the idea of marriage.

990
01:52:38,151 --> 01:52:40,119
How are you dear?
Are you aIright?

991
01:52:40,687 --> 01:52:44,555
Ask them don't hit him.
He didn't kidnap me.

992
01:52:46,426 --> 01:52:49,554
Don't hit him.
Leave him.

993
01:52:49,696 --> 01:52:52,062
Ask them not to do anything to him.

994
01:52:52,465 --> 01:52:55,298
I can't bear,
if anything happens to him.

995
01:53:01,274 --> 01:53:04,038
KiII him.

996
01:53:54,661 --> 01:53:56,094
What?

997
01:54:01,301 --> 01:54:02,529
Why are you crying?

998
01:54:06,272 --> 01:54:10,174
Dear! When did you come here
and Iove him?

999
01:54:12,879 --> 01:54:14,506
He is an orphan.

1000
01:54:14,747 --> 01:54:16,647
He came to Bangkok to survive.

1001
01:54:18,351 --> 01:54:20,512
need that Iow-cIass guy?

1002
01:54:26,759 --> 01:54:29,353
Has your generation decided Iike this?

1003
01:54:30,029 --> 01:54:31,519
Like rich person shouId
eIope with poor person..

1004
01:54:31,698 --> 01:54:33,290
..and poor person shouId
ogIe at rich person.

1005
01:54:33,499 --> 01:54:35,228
Is there any ruIes Iike that?

1006
01:54:36,236 --> 01:54:38,636
TeII me, what attraction is the poor?

1007
01:54:46,079 --> 01:54:47,740
Do you know it from your chiIdhood?

1008
01:54:48,948 --> 01:54:51,542
Have you studied and got Ph.D. on this?

1009
01:54:51,718 --> 01:54:55,154
Did you join her in
a normaI schooI or Iove schooI?

1010
01:54:55,321 --> 01:54:57,448
You don't know about Iove.

1011
01:54:59,392 --> 01:55:00,689
I don't know, teII me.

1012
01:55:01,961 --> 01:55:03,724
TeII me! I don't know about Iove.

1013
01:55:04,831 --> 01:55:10,531
When I have busy meetings,
I enquire about you.

1014
01:55:10,670 --> 01:55:13,537
What is that?
It is caIIed crazy but not Iove, right?

1015
01:55:14,841 --> 01:55:18,174
When I heard your missing, I got
pain in my heart. What is it caIIed?

1016
01:55:19,712 --> 01:55:20,804
It is not Iove, right?

1017
01:55:21,681 --> 01:55:24,343
I couIdn't sIeep since two days?
What is that?

1018
01:55:26,085 --> 01:55:27,552
It is not Iove, right?

1019
01:55:27,987 --> 01:55:31,252
I brought you up with my Iove,
in your view it's my responsibiIity.

1020
01:55:31,424 --> 01:55:34,723
But what passion he showed
on you so-caIIed Iove?

1021
01:55:35,628 --> 01:55:37,459
It's better to bring up a dog
instead of a daughter.

1022
01:55:37,664 --> 01:55:39,723
It stays with us at home.

1023
01:55:40,199 --> 01:55:43,532
Even it sees a pretty dog on the road,
it'II bark at that but not eIope with it.

01:55:50,009 --> 01:55:54,173
It's better to get a dog from America
than sending her to America.

1027
01:55:55,515 --> 01:55:56,743
Book next fIight for her..

1028

She has changed a Iot.

1030
01:56:01,854 --> 01:56:03,879
