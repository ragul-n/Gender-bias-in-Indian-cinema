1
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:45,333
Yay!

2
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:52,375
-Just one round, today. -No. One more please.

3
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:02,458
We'll do this again tomorrow.

4
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:08,958
Right here.

5
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:10,458
Check this one.

6
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:11,416
Can't find it here either.

7
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:14,000
This side.

8
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,500
This side.

9
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,791
Can't seem to find house 207's meter.

10
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:18,750
How's that possible?

11
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,833
Tell me the meter number.

12
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,458
It ends with 5746.

13
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:26,625
5746...

14
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,500
5746...

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,416
Here it is.

16
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:33,875
Go upstairs and tell them that

17
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:37,875
we'll be disconnecting the electricity line.

18
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,458
Brother, you finished yet?

19
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:02,458
Your shirt is ready.

20
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,416
Yeah...

21
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,166
Here she is.

22
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,000
Is Jamun Prasad home?

23
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,958
No, sir. Dad has left for his clinic.

24
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,916
We have to disconnect your electricity line.

25
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:21,666
Your payments are overdue.

26
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:25,791
- Payments have been made. My brother had... - It's been pending for three months.

27
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:30,875
Well, you should ask your brother if he actually made the payments.

28
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,375
Sir...

29
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,416
I forgot to mention...

30
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,833
Dad just stepped out to get money from the ATM.

31
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:39,833
We'll definitely make the payment today.

32
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,375
Please don't disconnect the power line.

33
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,250
Do ensure that the payment is made today,

34
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,250
or we'll disconnect the line tomorrow, without notice.

35
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:53,458
Amar Prasad.

36
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,833
Amar Prasad or Amar Kumar Prasad?

37
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,958
Yes, Amar Kumar Prasad.

38
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,000
You forgot your surname?

39
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,125
Their tax records for the past year have been verified.

40
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,833
It's not possible to approve a loan for these IDs.

41
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,625
All set?

42
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,750
Look, the thing is...

43
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,333
Your loan can't be approved.

44
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,791
-Huh? -What?

45
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,291
Based on your credit history, it's almost impossible.

46
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,250
It was all fine till yesterday. So, today we came here for the final approval.

47
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,875
What happened overnight suddenly?

48
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,041
Sir, this is not right.

49
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,208
For the past 10 days, we've done everything you told us to.

50
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:29,708
And now I am telling you something new.

51
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,416
Don't give me that crap.

52
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:38,208
Are we getting the loan amount in cash or will it be transferred to the account?

53
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,750
Sir, your loan can't be approved. Sorry.

54
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,750
It can't be approved? Why not?

55
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,458
I told you it can't be done.

56
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,916
We can't be dishing out loans to any random person off the street.

57
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:52,125
You think I'm a person off the street? Huh?

58
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,583
C'mon... Listen, you try again after six months.

59
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,708
I'll personally approve your loan. I assure you.

60
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,583
Fuck you and your assurances.

61
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:03,125
Aye, mind your language.

62
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:04,625
-Tell him to watch his mouth. -Bro, calm down.

63
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,666
-I'm tired of this fucking crap. -I'm helping-

64
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:12,000
Fuck you. You had called us here to approve the loan.

65
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,416
I'll get even your fucking daddy to approve the loan.

66
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,208
Watch your fucking mouth, and don't talk shit about my father.

67
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,416
I'll talk shit about you and your entire fucking chimp family.

68
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,583
Oh yeah? I'm not giving you the loan.

69
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:21,833
Bro, stop...

70
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,833
Listen...

71
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,333
-Bro? -Yeah?

72
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,250
How did you cook up that story about a dairy farm?

73
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,250
Randomly, man. Whatever came into my head.

74
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,000
You could've said something better. Restaurant? Pharmacy? Anything.

75
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,666
C'mon bro. There go away our dreams of settling in Dubai.

76
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,416
And we got a thrashing from that fucking chimp.

77
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,833
Bro, you ruined it by intervening.

78
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,833
Otherwise, I would have yanked out every hair off that chimp's swinging skull.

79
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,708
Leaving him bald for the rest of his life.

80
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:58,416
Bro, relax. And Take it Easy.

81
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:03,416
So my distant uncle is inaugurating his salon today.

82
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,541
Let's go there and stuff ourselves with some good food.

83
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:11,666
And we'll top it off with a free facial.

84
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:15,666
-Want to go? -Yeah.

85
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,791
Now, open up your palm.

86
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:29,833
Son, this locking up happens not in the joints but in the brain.

87
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,958
If you tell the brain that you have arthritis...

88
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,166
then that's exactly what the body will follow.

89
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:35,916
Sir, that's exactly what I tell him as well.

90
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,416
But he doesn't listen. Does he?

91
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:38,125
Nope, not at all.

92
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:42,875
The kid is talking sense. It's all in the mind.

93
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,291
You should get him some fresh air more often.

94
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,291
We do. But lately, it's not been as often as before.

95
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,208
-How come? -Just got a little occupied...

96
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:54,666
-Hmm...occupied? -Just been a little hectic, that's all.

97
00:06:55,166 --> 00:07:02,500
Mr. Neelkanth, the grandson's growing up. Keep an eye on him.

98
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,458
Take this prescription.

99
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,666
Take each medicine, three times a day.

100
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,333
Take this outside to Jagat. He'll give you the medicines.

101
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,708
-And your fee? -You can give that to him as well.

102
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,333
All set? Take the medicines on time. I'll see you in two weeks.

103
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:16,458
Yes, surely. Namaste.

104
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:21,125
Take care of yourself Mr. Neelkanth. Don't forget to exercise in the outdoors.

105
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,000
Sir, I'll accompany him.

106
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,416
Go alone if your grandson can't accompany you.

107
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:32,250
-Namaste, Mr. Damodar. Come in. -How are you, Mr. Jamun?

108
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,333
All good. Please have a seat.

109
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,416
Sorry, I couldn't join you on the walk today.

110
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,041
Yes, I was waiting...

111
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:44,416
I wanted you to meet Mr. Ashok. He's a wedding mediator.

112
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:50,708
The photos I took from you - of your daughter, Chetna - were given to him.

113
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,625
So, the boy is a Branch Manager in Andhra Bank.

114
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,375
-Manager right? -Yes.

115
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:58,000
-Yeah. A branch manager, working in Trichy.

116
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,416
Mr. Damodar I would much rather prefer the groom to be from this city.

117
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:06,041
Why send my daughter to another home in such a far way city?

118
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:09,416
Mr. Jamun also has a son, an engineering graduate.

119
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:10,791
Please find some suitable options for him as well.

120
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,625
Yes, certainly. This is what I do for a living.

121
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:18,041
First, let's find a suitable groom for the daughter.

122
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,708
-I'll muti-task. Don't you worry. -All right.

123
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,333
Have a look at the boy's pictures.

124
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:27,333
Here you go.

125
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:34,416
The boy isn't exactly pleasing on the eye.

126
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:07,291
CPR. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation...

127
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:13,875
is used to bring back consciousness to a person who has collapsed.

128
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,833
If this sticky situation arises, do not get confused.

129
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,166
Performing a CPR should be the first step.

130
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:25,541
First check the breathing of the patient.

131
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,083
Check the responsiveness of the patient.

132
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:31,833
If the patient doesn't respond-

133
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,500
I've been waiting for you since forever.

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,500
Class ran late. Wait a second. I'll be back.

135
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:42,916
-Sorry. -It's okay.

136
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,125
Why are you panicking?

137
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:48,166
No, I just thought it'd be best if you were alone with Amit.

138
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,750
Want to join us to the zoo?

139
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,125
It'll be fun.

140
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,291
I'd rather not be the third wheel. You guys go. Have fun.

141
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:58,083
Anyway, I've to go pay the electricity bill. They came to disconnect the line today.

142
00:09:58,583 --> 00:09:59,416
-Again? -Yeah.

143
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:03,583
-My brother didn't pay the bill. -Oh okay.

144
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,125
-Should I drop you somewhere? -No, it's fine. He's waiting. You go ahead.

145
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:10,125
-You sure? -Positive. See you.

146
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,625
Bro, why don't you join in?

147
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,708
This is the best face-pack they got. And it's free for us.

148
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:31,250
-I'm good, bro. -Suit yourself.

149
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,291
I hope you enjoyed your meal.

150
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:38,000
C'mon, Uncle. My entire face pack dried up waiting for you.

151
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,083
-How are you, son? -Great. It was fun.

152
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,083
You've opened up a great salon.

153
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,083
It's been nicely renovated. -Yeah, son.

154
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:49,458
-And what about your mobiles' booth? -My nephew is handling that.

155
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,583
So, you got a loan for its renovation?

156
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,500
Who's going to give loans to people like us?

157
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,500
So, how did you get the money?

158
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
How does a handicap -with one arm- get by?

159
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,000
Well, by using the other arm - the one that's not broken.

160
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,791
And the one who is blind in one eye?

161
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,791
Well, by using the other eye.

162
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:23,208
Son, the human body is really precious. You understand?

163
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,125
Don't stress. Let's have some samosas.

164
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,333
Let me get rid of this face-pack.

165
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:32,500
Do that later. Let's go eat first.

166
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,583
Uncle, this is my friend -Amar.

167
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,791
Uncle, you got some change?

168
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,541
One, two, three.

169
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:44,916
Yay. Once more.

170
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:46,041
Good girl.

171
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:50,625
-Once more please. -There you go.

172
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,625
-Hi, Roshni. -Hi, mommy.

173
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,625
-Hi, Uncle. -How are you my child?

174
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,083
You two came up together?

175
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,875
Yeah, I met her downstairs. Took her for a bike ride.

176
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,416
-Thank you, Uncle. -No problem. Carry on.

177
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,291
-Say bye to Uncle. -Bye, Uncle.

178
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:08,291
Goodbye. We'll do it again tomorrow.

179
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,708
He's not someone who fears challenge, but someone who makes challenge fear him.

180
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:07,708
He will definitely return.

181
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:24,250
In due time, I will be freed of this chaos.

182
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:32,250
You will never be freed of this chaos.

183
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,250
Daddy, don't chew too fast. I'm bringing another appetizer.

184
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,500
Sweetheart, why don't you eat as well? It's already 9:00.

185
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,958
I'm okay. You continue. I'll eat with Amar, once he's home.

186
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,083
Where's your brother been the whole day?

187
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,333
-He mentioned something about some loan sanctioning.

188
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:56,333
What?

189
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,208
To get some loan sanctioned.

190
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,208
Who's giving him this loan?

191
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:04,041
Some small Credit Union. Lokesh has also gone with him.

192
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:05,791
I hope he hasn't mortgaged this house or something...

193
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,250
Don't be silly, dad. Why would he do something like that?

194
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,250
Well, he would have had to give some collateral.

195
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,125
He was saying it's a personal loan.

196
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:19,125
-Personal? -Yeah.

197
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:24,583
-Hi, brother.

198
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:37,291
Why don't you freshen up? I'll serve dinner.

199
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,791
I'll bring it to your room.

200
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,125
I'm not hungry.

201
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:45,125
Chetna, you have your dinner. People can eat whenever they want.

202
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,916
-Are you hurt? -It's nothing. I'm fine.

203
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,541
How did you get hurt?

204
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,041
-Sweetheart, bring me the soup please. -Yes, dad. Just a sec.

205
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:09,041
-How did you get hurt- -You go and give him his soup.

206
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,875
You sit here and have your dinner. Let him eat whenever he wants to.

207
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,708
Amar's got hurt on his cheek.

208
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:22,916
Then you can go and be his doctor.

209
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:26,916
C'mon dad.

210
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,500
I'm not hungry. I'll eat later if I feel like it.

211
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,416
I've got the plate already. Just have it now.

212
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:46,416
C'mon, brother.

213
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:52,208
All right. I'll have it later. You go to the other room.

214
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:52,875
You want something else?

215
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,875
Chetna, please have your dinner. What are you doing inside there?

216
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:01,750
Listen.

217
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,750
Listen up. Amar.

218
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,208
Don't worry; I'm not having your food.

219
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,541
Did I say anything to you?

220
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:18,041
You never say, you just taunt.

221
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:25,291
Do I interfere in anything you do? Your friends, work, life. No, nothing.

222
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:29,500
Keep getting into these scuffles, and pretty soon you'll be a wanted criminal.

223
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,541
Dad, don't be hysterical.

224
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:36,000
Dad, don't walk all over me just because I've kept my mouth shut.

225
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,500
My mouth is also shut. It's the people that are talking.

226
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,625
This day would never have come, if you had worried about your son

227
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:42,750
more than the people.

228
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,458
-Hey, what haven't I done for you? -Please dad. That's enough.

229
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,166
Did I not raise you well?

230
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,083
I stayed hungry so you could become an engineer.

231
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:54,708
Your sister has already turned 28.

232
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,791
She's still roaming the streets -with her squint eye- unmarried.

233
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,333
Do you at all care for any of this?

234
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:01,625
-Keeps blabbering all day. -Please stop, dad.

235
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,291
That is all you care about - the daughter!

236
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:09,166
The daughter's wedding, her education, her eye, her dowry!

237
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,166
Have you ever cared for the son?

238
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,208
And you forced me to become an engineer...

239
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:20,208
so your dignity could be maintained amongst your relatives.

240
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:21,750
You did all this for your sake, not ours.

241
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,416
Do you have any shame?

242
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,708
Just drop it, dad. Go wash your hands.

243
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,666
Who do you think are?

244
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:29,750
You don't care about your sister.

245
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,791
You talk back to your father.

246
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,583
You've lost all shame.

247
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:37,750
And you expect me to be your credit card for the rest of my life?

248
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,708
Why didn't you come to your mother's funeral?

249
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:44,750
Dad, don't you dare open up mom's chapter again.

250
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:45,541
Ok, that's enough.

251
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,291
Dad why do you bring this up when you know he feels hurt about it.

252
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,333
Let him feel hurt. I don't care. Get out.

253
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,250
Amar, wait.

254
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,500
Dad, please get up. Talk to him.

255
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,458
I don't want to stay in this house.

256
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:02,375
Amar.

257
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,625
You finished?

258
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,208
-He left. -Let him. He'll be back.

259
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:12,000
Leave his dinner plate here. He's not going to go anywhere.

260
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,000
Bring his dinner plate.

261
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,458
Good Morning, doctor. Good Morning.

262
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:33,416
Running a little late today?

263
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,625
Yeah, my blood pressure had shot up last night.

264
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,708
-That's not good. -Yeah.

265
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:42,000
-How're you feeling now? -Better.

266
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,791
Yesterday, I spoke to the Photo Studio person. Visit him once you get a chance.

267
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,541
Sure.

268
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:53,125
This is the 'mother look'. Rs. 800 with an album cover.

269
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,750
This is the 'sister look'. Rs. 500 with or without an album cover.

270
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:02,250
This is the 'model look'. Make up is complementary.

271
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,958
The 'mother look' isn't that great. Let's go for the 'family look'.

272
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,083
Let's ask her.

273
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:13,875
'Mother look' is a bit pricey. Certainly, the 'family look' must cost lesser.

274
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:17,666
No. The draping of the saree is hard work.

275
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,750
There is no discount on that package.

276
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,750
My daughter can wear the saree herself.

277
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,000
Dad, this place seems expensive. Should we try somewhere else?

278
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,875
Wait up. We'll figure.

279
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:28,916
So, what should we-

280
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:32,333
Sir, you'll get the desired results.

281
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,916
But let's get the price right first.

282
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:38,541
Ma'am turn to your right. No, camera right.

283
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,750
Don't pose with that gun.

284
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,750
Where are you looking?

285
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,166
Move the finger to the other side.

286
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:51,166
Give a friendly smile.

287
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:59,250
-My daughter has a right eye squint. -Squint?

288
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,083
Yeah, the eyes aren't aligned properly.

289
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:07,416
So, can someone take a good picture of her?

290
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:11,416
I'll show you. Everything's possible these days.

291
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,958
Yes, just like an actress.

292
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,416
One minute...

293
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,041
-Sweetheart, take off your glasses. -Take them off?

294
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,625
-Yeah. I spoke to them. -You sure?

295
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,416
-Yeah, it'll be fine.

296
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,000
-Okay.

297
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,583
All set. Go ahead.

298
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:41,333
Look to the right. Right there.

299
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:48,208
Ready. 1, 2, 3...Smile.

300
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:53,583
You reach easily.... - Yes, Mr. Ashok had mentioned that.

301
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,333
This is my son -Amar.

302
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,625
Yes, Mr. Ashok had mentioned, that the girl has an elder brother.

303
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:00,916
Yes, that's him.

304
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:04,250
Where do you work, son?

305
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:08,416
I'm on vacation for now.

306
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:12,333
Oh, okay.

307
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,416
Son, where in Jhansi are you working?

308
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:15,500
In Sonapur.

309
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,833
-Okay. -Have something to drink.

310
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:21,708
CV?

311
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:25,708
Son, serve the guests.

312
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,333
-Have something. -I avoid cold drinks.

313
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,458
It's not that cold. Please have it.

314
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:39,625
I'm okay. Thank you.

315
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:43,583
Have some samosas.

316
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:47,583
Son, when is your vacation finishing?

317
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,791
I stay at home.

318
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:58,916
It's been six years since I finished my engineering degree.

319
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:04,583
Son, check if Chetna's ready. Bring her here, if she is.

320
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:08,583
Okay, I'll bring her.

321
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,500
-What are you doing? -Wait, it's stuck.

322
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,958
-Okay, hurry up now. -Yeah, just a sec.

323
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:25,750
-Chetna, you're looking like an angel. -Only you can think of me as an angel.

324
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:30,041
-The saree's looking fine right? -It's perfect.

325
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:35,666
-Will you be wearing the glasses? -Nope.

326
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:39,666
-Chetna. -Come in, dad.

327
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:49,833
-Let's go, sweetheart. -Let's go.

328
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:53,833
What happened?

329
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,958
-Should I wear it? -Yes, wear.

330
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:03,041
-Ok. -Let's go.

331
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:07,041
All the best.

332
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,583
Will you speak in English?

333
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:17,041
Our son works for an international corporation. - Okay.

334
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:21,458
Hello, how are you today?

335
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:24,875
Good. Good. How are you?

336
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:27,041
Fine. Thank you.

337
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:29,625
You're welcome.

338
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:33,583
Your hobbies?

339
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:40,041
My hobby is, I am nursing. That is my work and hobby.

340
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:45,666
And yours. Sorry, and yours?

341
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:54,916
Going to the gym. Ludo. Big Boss. Sometimes, I cook as well.

342
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:58,375
Our son's almost a professional chef.

343
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:05,875
Before we proceed... This is Lalit's grandma.

344
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:13,125
She's been present for all the weddings in our family.

345
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:16,416
Mom, over to you.

346
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:22,250
Sweetheart, will you walk for us?

347
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,500
Sweetheart, walk.

348
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,458
Come sweetheart, walk.

349
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:29,458
Get up...

350
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:46,791
Wait...Raise your saree a bit.

351
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:47,916
What?

352
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:51,916
-It's okay. -Just a bit. Don't be shy.

353
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:01,708
Come. Sit with me.

354
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:08,083
Show me your palm please. Place it in my hands.

355
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:17,083
Wow, such gorgeous hands. So gentle. Beautiful.

356
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:21,083
Now, take off your glasses.

357
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:26,375
It's a minor prescription. Just .25.

358
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:30,416
That's okay. Sweetheart, take off your glasses.

359
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:33,958
If the groom doesn't wear glasses, then neither should the bride.

360
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:37,416
Anyway, we have laser-eye-surgery these days.

361
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:43,666
-Let her keep them on. -No, please take off the glasses.

362
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:47,666
Sweetheart, please take them off.

363
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,500
Sweetheart...

364
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:37,291
won't you sit?

365
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:46,791
I'm sorry.

366
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:54,583
Why are you apologizing? You're not at fault.

367
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:58,583
I've failed in finding a suitable groom for you.

368
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:08,958
You've done a lot for me, dad. I'll never forget that.

369
00:27:09,458 --> 00:27:15,125
You can't help it if I'm a squint.

370
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:22,791
My beautiful daughter has been rejected by 6 boys.

371
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:34,958
-I've completely let you down... -Why are you crying, daddy?

372
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:36,250
If you break down, I'll fall apart.

373
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,250
Please don't cry.

374
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:32,833
This is the regulator that is used to control the dripping.

375
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:38,708
Pushing the knob all the way down will stop the dripping completely.

376
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:42,708
Moving it up and down will regulate...

377
00:29:56,416 --> 00:29:58,750
Getting into a relationship is not a sin you know.

378
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,541
-Relationship? -Yeah.

379
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:02,750
At least, try once.

380
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,458
Don't be silly.

381
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:08,250
-Ice cream. -Thank you.

382
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:12,250
-Oh, thank you. -Thank you.

383
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:28,208
Damodar, it'll cost me Rs. 200,000. Three years ago, it was half of this.

384
00:30:28,708 --> 00:30:33,416
I completely understand. But it needs to be done.

385
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:37,333
You should increase your visitation fee. Your fee is way too low for today's times.

386
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:41,333
If I also start earning unreasonably, how will I live with that truth?

387
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,833
-Hi. -Hi -Lokesh.

388
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:59,416
I hope you guys have made up your mind.

389
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:03,375
Once our transaction is done, we don't know each other.

390
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:04,958
We'll get paid partly in advance right?

391
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:08,583
Of, course. So you don't back out. Rs. 10,000.

392
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:10,958
Sir, that's too less.

393
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:12,750
Let the surgery finish.

394
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:13,875
-He's right. -No, it's too less.

395
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:16,458
Rest of the payment will happen post surgery.

396
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:20,458
It'll be one large sum. Don't worry. Come.

397
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:32,416
Kavita...

398
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:34,666
The procedure will take five days.

399
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:37,291
-All details will be matched up with the donor recipient.

400
00:31:37,791 --> 00:31:40,208
-Make a fist.

401
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:41,708
Why are you taking our blood?

402
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:50,875
To match your sample with the donor recipients' samples.

403
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:54,583
This has the details of the family members.

404
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:56,125
Why do we need this?

405
00:31:56,625 --> 00:32:01,250
Because only a family member or a close friend is eligible to donate the kidney.

406
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,833
Forget these details.

407
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,083
Just cut us up. Take our kidneys. Give our money. And we'll leave.

408
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:09,416
This surgery involves the kidney, not the appendix.

409
00:32:09,916 --> 00:32:13,750
Kavita, take his sample as well.

410
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,666
-Roll up your sleeve. -Please be gentle.

411
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:18,333
Relax, it's nothing.

412
00:32:18,833 --> 00:32:21,375
Softly....

413
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:25,375
Softly....

414
00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:06,708
Her eye muscles are imbalanced. That is causing the de-alignment in the eyes.

415
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:10,500
This is known as esotropia.

416
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,958
But do not worry too much. This can be corrected by surgery.

417
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:17,666
How much will this cost?

418
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:23,333
Approximately.... Rs. 250,000.

419
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:31,375
It's a complex surgery. We need to open up the entire eye.

420
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:36,333
Simply put, it's like painting a picture on a grain of rice.

421
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:40,000
Ma'am, is it necessary to perform the surgery?

422
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,791
I'd read on the internet that eye drops can correct the problem.

423
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:45,708
This certainly can't be fixed with eye drops.

424
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:48,541
But meanwhile, I can show you some exercises.

425
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:51,916
Close one eye. Look here.

426
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:56,708
Here. Now, back here.

427
00:35:57,208 --> 00:36:00,708
What happened, dad?

428
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:06,208
Repeat this 10 times with each eye.

429
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:08,250
Back and forth.

430
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,458
And the other exercises-

431
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:13,041
What's wrong, dad?

432
00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:16,958
Sir, are you okay?

433
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:17,625
What's wrong, dad?

434
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:18,375
Let me call the nurse.

435
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:21,750
Dad.

436
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,625
Dr. Lama, we're finished with all the tests?

437
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:27,125
Yes, we are.

438
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:29,750
There shouldn't be a delay in the payment.

439
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:33,750
You've already received the advance. You'll get the rest on time as well.

440
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:44,791
You enjoyed keeping this a secret, didn't you?

441
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:46,291
Now, how do I tell Amar about this?

442
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:49,125
What were you waiting for?

443
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,625
Your marriage.

444
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:54,666
So am I married now?

445
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:58,416
Dad, my marriage will happen when it has to.

446
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,541
Why do you keep stressing over futile matters?

447
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:04,750
Sweetheart, before I die, I want to see you married.

448
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:09,500
I can't trust Amar. So, I have to take the sole responsibility.

449
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,875
So, you're the only responsible one?

450
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:15,875
Then, should I leave you in an old age home after marriage?

451
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:29,166
Are you aware that your condition will soon demand a full-time guardian for you?

452
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:34,750
And it's not as if the Constitution of India is forcing you to marry off your daughter.

453
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:40,000
This is the constitution of Indian society, my child.

454
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:47,208
Okay. So let's ask this society to pay for my eye surgery.

455
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:49,500
Let's go. Let's go start asking for donations.

456
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,666
Let's start with Roshni's mom.

457
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:56,916
Get up. Why are you still sitting down?

458
00:37:57,416 --> 00:38:00,791
All right. Go grab a big bowl.

459
00:38:01,291 --> 00:38:04,916
Get the biggest one we have.

460
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,083
I'm serious. Don't make me laugh.

461
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:13,875
I'm not making you laugh. You're laughing yourself.

462
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,500
Let's hit the streets asking for donations.

463
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,541
And we'll use the money to fix this boom-box.

464
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:25,666
You always talk like a silly goose.

465
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:28,458
It's you who talks silly. I'm not going to talk to you.

466
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:31,166
Even I shouldn't listen to your silly talks.

467
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:32,125
Then don't.

468
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:33,333
-Then don't make me listen to all that. -I'm not talking to you.

469
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:37,333
I'm not talking to you either.

470
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:52,083
Bro, I've come up with a great plan.

471
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:58,583
There's this guy I know in Madh Island, who has a leather factory in Dubai.

472
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:01,250
We get close to him, and our job will be done.

473
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,541
Bro, you your great fucking plans...

474
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,250
How will we go to Dubai if we have no money?

475
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:15,333
Bro, we'll get the money as well. Don't worry. Relax Take it Easy.

476
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:22,083
And what is this jackass doctor upto? Every other day we have to do a new test.

477
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:24,458
When is he going to give us the money?

478
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:27,083
Bro, it'll all get sorted out.

479
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:31,083
Bro, how the fuck will it get sorted out?

480
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:42,541
We got no money. We got no family.

481
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:46,541
Bro, it'll be all right. There's a right time for everything.

482
00:39:52,458 --> 00:40:00,125
Bro, my dad must be worried sick about me.

483
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:07,666
About my work, my future...

484
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:13,541
That's why he's always angry with me. That's his way of showing affection.

485
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:17,541
Bro, this is your problem. You always get sentimental after getting drunk.

486
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:29,250
I've neither been a good son, nor a good brother.

487
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:41,000
Bro, listen to me. We should first think about getting us fixed.

488
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,000
How?

489
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:52,916
Pick up.

490
00:40:53,416 --> 00:40:56,416
Yes, Doctor Lama?

491
00:40:56,916 --> 00:40:58,708
The patient has been admitted in the hospital.

492
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:02,416
The surgery will take place day after.

493
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:07,708
Stay away from alcohol, sugar and any excessive physical activity. Okay?

494
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:11,708
I'll SMS you the timings tomorrow.

495
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,500
Bro, finally, it's time.

496
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,500
Let's do this.

497
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:09,958
Kavita, let's speed things up please.

498
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:28,250
Aye...

499
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:32,250
take this off.

500
00:42:37,041 --> 00:42:39,791
Bro, you carry on. I can't do this.

501
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,125
Have you gone mad? What is this nonsense?

502
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:44,541
Bro, don't be stupid.

503
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:47,583
Bro, I'm too shook. I can't do this.

504
00:42:48,083 --> 00:42:51,750
Aye, I told you- Buzz off.

505
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,625
You can't do this. Lie down.

506
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:59,500
Bro, you get your Rs. 250,000 from this. I'll get my share from somewhere else.

507
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,875
I promise.

508
00:43:01,375 --> 00:43:02,541
We don't have enough time.

509
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:06,416
Bro, I can't believe this. Unbelievable...

510
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:08,291
You're going to bail out on me like this?

511
00:43:08,791 --> 00:43:09,250
If you don't want to do this-

512
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:10,083
Shut up, motherfucker.

513
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:12,166
I'm talking to him.

514
00:43:12,666 --> 00:43:16,875
Bro, I'm terrified. I can't do this. But we'll go to Dubai together.

515
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:20,541
I'll take care of the money. You know I've never gone against you.

516
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:24,541
I'm shook, bro. I can't help it.

517
00:43:28,416 --> 00:43:31,000
Get out. Get him out.

518
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,958
-You done? Leave now. -Leave.

519
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:39,958
Amar, let's go.

520
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:10,375
-What's up? You guys done already? -Uncle, I couldn't do it.

521
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:13,333
Where's Amar?

522
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:15,750
Amar's getting it done.

523
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:18,250
-And you left him alone? -Yeah.

524
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:24,250
Uncle, I need Rs. 250,000 from you - anyhow. I've given Amar my word.

525
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:28,416
Have you gone crazy? Where will I get that kind of money?

526
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:31,291
-Uncle- -Please don't expect that from me.

527
00:44:31,791 --> 00:44:38,000
-Amar will be okay right? -Of course, he will be.

528
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:42,000
I'll call you back.

529
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:02,083
-Watch over everyone. Sir, sit there please.

530
00:45:02,583 --> 00:45:04,583
Where's Doctor Pawar? Who's the in-charge?

531
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:08,750
-Come with me. -Quickly.

532
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,208
Sandeep, check here.

533
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:14,208
Check all the rooms.

534
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:19,000
-Where's Doctor Pawar? -What?

535
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,791
-Where's Doctor Pawar? -He's not here.

536
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:25,791
-And you are? -Dr. Raj.

537
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,500
Get out of here. Madame, leave right now.

538
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,083
You sit down here.

539
00:45:38,583 --> 00:45:41,791
Who's inside there? Come out, asshole.

540
00:45:42,291 --> 00:45:45,083
Get out.

541
00:45:45,583 --> 00:45:48,416
Get out.

542
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:50,625
Sandeep, take him inside.

543
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:54,541
Get out.

544
00:45:55,041 --> 00:45:56,416
What the fuck are you doing here? Get out.

545
00:45:56,916 --> 00:45:58,041
Shut up and move inside. The cops are here.

546
00:45:58,541 --> 00:46:00,583
If you enter here, you're not going to get the money.

547
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:04,625
Fuck the money. The cops are here. We'll all get busted, motherfucker.

548
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:08,625
Fuck.

549
00:46:12,208 --> 00:46:18,625
Unhook him. Hurry up.

550
00:46:19,125 --> 00:46:21,541
Be careful.

551
00:46:22,041 --> 00:46:24,500
It's me -Sandeep.

552
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,500
-Careful. -I am.

553
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:31,625
Shut that door.

554
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:35,416
Send me a backup of five personnel.

555
00:46:35,916 --> 00:46:39,416
-Sandeep! -Coming, sir.

556
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:55,083
Where the fuck is he?

557
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:04,583
-Carry him properly. -I am.

558
00:47:08,916 --> 00:47:14,875
Bro, you'll be good.

559
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:17,583
We're almost there.

560
00:47:18,083 --> 00:47:21,041
-Motherfucker, carry him properly. -That's what I'm doing.

561
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:22,583
I'll rip you open.

562
00:47:23,083 --> 00:47:27,916
Bro, we're almost there.

563
00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:32,250
Stop! Stop!

564
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:43,166
Bro, we're almost there. Bro...

565
00:47:43,666 --> 00:47:47,166
Bro, open you eyes.

566
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:56,125
Bro, open you eyes.

567
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:56,958
Bro, we're almost there. Bro...

568
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:00,375
Morey, get a hold of him. Grab him.

569
00:48:00,875 --> 00:48:04,375
We're almost there.

570
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,125
A package for Mr. Jamun Prasad.

571
00:50:05,625 --> 00:50:09,125
Sign here, please.

572
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:13,458
Thank you.

573
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:18,458
-Who sent the package? -Amar Jamun Prasad.

574
00:50:18,958 --> 00:50:22,458
Thank you.

575
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:44,875
Brother, shirt is ready.

576
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:22,166
You can do it.

577
00:52:22,666 --> 00:52:24,958
Yes.

578
00:52:25,458 --> 00:52:26,833
Stay.

579
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:29,083
Most symptoms are indicating Parkinson's.

580
00:52:29,583 --> 00:52:35,000
It's in an early stage, but it'll increase with time.

581
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,916
He might experience tremors. As much as possible,

582
00:52:39,416 --> 00:52:43,083
try to keep him away from stress.

583
00:52:43,583 --> 00:52:48,458
The second stage will bring along rigidity and stiffness.

584
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:51,333
That might cause some pain while walking.

585
00:52:51,833 --> 00:52:58,708
He might experience difficulties in sitting down and getting up.

586
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:01,625
Please ensure a guardian is with him at all times.

587
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:06,958
He also might have trouble understanding normal conversation.

588
00:53:07,458 --> 00:53:14,875
-So, he won't be able to run his clinic? -A sabbatical is my suggestion.

589
00:53:15,375 --> 00:53:18,875
I'll write down some prescription medicines which he must take daily.

590
00:53:52,083 --> 00:53:56,458
-Make a fist and tap on it- -Until the veins are visible.

591
00:53:56,958 --> 00:53:58,416
-Yes, and only then insert the syringe.

592
00:53:58,916 --> 00:54:02,416
-Can you see the veins? -Yes

593
00:54:33,166 --> 00:54:40,416
Our neighbours called me here urgently when he tried entering the wrong house.

594
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:42,125
The whole area had been flooded with water.

595
00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:44,333
It took me 45 minutes to bring him upstairs.

596
00:54:44,833 --> 00:54:47,541
What can i do?

597
00:54:48,041 --> 00:54:50,916
What if he had slipped and got hurt?

598
00:54:51,416 --> 00:54:54,333
Would his body withstand an injury at this age?

599
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,708
And on top of all this, he's a Parkinson's patient.

600
00:54:57,208 --> 00:55:00,500
Please make him understand.

601
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,041
Jamun, you ought to be more careful.

602
00:55:04,541 --> 00:55:06,958
You must not add to Chetna's problems.

603
00:55:07,458 --> 00:55:11,416
-What's the need to go downstairs? -Exactly.

604
00:55:11,916 --> 00:55:16,958
She's treating you well, isn't she?

605
00:55:17,458 --> 00:55:25,083
I...wanted... to help her.

606
00:55:25,583 --> 00:55:29,625
Dad, you've raised me well. That's more than enough.

607
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:33,625
Now, I'm able enough to take care of you and this home.

608
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,500
I... feel.... suffocated.

609
00:56:00,625 --> 00:56:04,875
Mr. Jamun, listen closely.

610
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:12,125
"Life is such a mystery"

611
00:56:12,625 --> 00:56:15,500
Which song did I just sing?

612
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,125
Life...

613
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:19,833
is a journey.

614
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:20,916
Nope. Try again.

615
00:56:21,416 --> 00:56:24,833
"Life is such a mystery"

616
00:56:25,333 --> 00:56:28,041
Life..

617
00:56:28,541 --> 00:56:29,166
Life..

618
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:30,041
Is..

619
00:56:30,541 --> 00:56:31,541
Is a journey...

620
00:56:32,041 --> 00:56:32,250
Nope.

621
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:33,625
...which leads...

622
00:56:34,125 --> 00:56:35,583
Try again, Mr. Jamun.

623
00:56:36,083 --> 00:56:37,875
Life..

624
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:40,875
-Is... -Life is...

625
00:56:41,375 --> 00:56:44,875
-Such a mystery -Such a mystery

626
00:56:57,458 --> 00:57:00,333
Is this your wife?

627
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:01,208
Try again, Mr. Jamun.

628
00:57:01,708 --> 00:57:08,375
No, sir. Just a co-worker.

629
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:13,291
Now, we'll do some exercises together.

630
00:57:13,791 --> 00:57:18,958
Not this one. We'll do this later.

631
00:57:19,458 --> 00:57:25,458
Touch my finger, with yours.

632
00:57:25,958 --> 00:57:26,041
Try it.

633
00:57:26,541 --> 00:57:30,041
Go on.

634
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:36,416
Try.

635
00:57:38,916 --> 00:57:40,583
Almost there.

636
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:44,333
That's it.

637
00:57:44,833 --> 00:57:49,416
The tremors' intensity has increased. The reflexes have also gone weak.

638
00:57:49,916 --> 00:57:52,250
You go on, I'll join you.

639
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:55,416
This is not a good sign, but it's inevitable.

640
00:57:55,916 --> 00:58:00,333
I've increased the dopamine dosage.

641
00:58:00,833 --> 00:58:01,333
So, I'll take your leave?

642
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:04,666
Yes. Thank you for arriving at such short notice Doctor.

643
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:07,875
-It's okay. -Thank you. He was very...

644
00:58:08,375 --> 00:58:11,375
No problem.

645
00:58:11,875 --> 00:58:16,000
By the way, what's your glasses' prescription?

646
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:22,791
-Minus two. -Okay.

647
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,125
Do you drink tea?

648
00:58:25,625 --> 00:58:29,125
Yes. Why?

649
00:58:30,166 --> 00:58:32,625
-Just that you didn't ask if I- -Oh I'm sorry. I apologize.

650
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:37,125
-Please come in. -It's fine. I was just kidding.

651
00:58:37,625 --> 00:58:41,125
-Maybe next time. -All right.

652
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:52,333
-Wow. It's beautiful. Congratulations. -Thank you. It's 22 carats.

653
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:54,916
22 carats?

654
00:58:55,416 --> 00:58:58,166
So will you be a applying to a private hospital?

655
00:58:58,666 --> 00:59:03,875
-Yeah. You? -Let me get married first.

656
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:07,833
Amit got a job as well. We'll probably fix the date for after-six months.

657
00:59:08,333 --> 00:59:10,791
-Double congratulations. -Thank you.

658
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:14,791
-You must come wedding shopping with me. -For sure.

659
00:59:58,583 --> 01:00:02,083
Dad?

660
01:00:04,458 --> 01:00:07,958
Dad?

661
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:17,000
Dad?

662
01:00:21,791 --> 01:00:25,291
Dad?

663
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:29,416
You're here?

664
01:00:29,916 --> 01:00:34,250
You're all set already.

665
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:43,125
These suspenders... Are they Amar's?

666
01:00:43,625 --> 01:00:47,125
Come, I'll show you something.

667
01:00:55,833 --> 01:00:59,333
I'm officially a nurse now. This is the certificate.

668
01:01:17,291 --> 01:01:24,083
My gosh! I've never seen someone so dressed up to go to the hospital.

669
01:01:24,583 --> 01:01:26,875
This as well?

670
01:01:27,375 --> 01:01:29,833
Oh, dad.

671
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:33,833
I...want to... go out.

672
01:01:49,291 --> 01:01:51,958
Come.

673
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,625
Easy.

674
01:01:55,125 --> 01:02:00,708
Dad, one step at a time.

675
01:02:01,208 --> 01:02:04,708
We're going...We're going.

676
01:02:12,791 --> 01:02:16,000
Dad, please be careful.

677
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,583
Dad. Dad.

678
01:02:18,083 --> 01:02:18,333
Help!

679
01:02:18,833 --> 01:02:22,333
Help!

680
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:51,833
-The tea's great here. Lemon-mint. -Okay, let's try it.

681
01:03:57,625 --> 01:04:01,125
-How's your father? -Getting by.

682
01:04:06,166 --> 01:04:14,875
Without your apron... you look a little different.

683
01:04:15,375 --> 01:04:19,458
I'm hoping that's a good thing.

684
01:04:19,958 --> 01:04:22,666
Do you have any siblings?

685
01:04:23,166 --> 01:04:30,083
I did -an elder brother. But he passed away in an accident.

686
01:04:30,583 --> 01:04:33,000
-Sorry to know that. -It's okay.

687
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:37,000
Has it been long?

688
01:04:42,041 --> 01:04:44,333
Thank you.

689
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:48,333
It's been about a year, since he passed away.

690
01:04:54,958 --> 01:05:03,375
You must take special care of your father. Parkinson's is almost incurable.

691
01:05:03,875 --> 01:05:06,458
I know.

692
01:05:06,958 --> 01:05:10,541
Your family stays in the city?

693
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:14,958
Umm, my mom stays with me. Dad's settled in Dubai.

694
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:16,833
Oh, wow!

695
01:05:17,333 --> 01:05:23,541
Actually, he re-married. It's been a while now.

696
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:30,333
So, your parents are separated?

697
01:05:30,833 --> 01:05:36,541
-Please don't mind. I was just- -Not at all. It's fine.

698
01:05:37,041 --> 01:05:41,208
I'm guessing a lot of families must be coming to see you; to ask for your hand.

699
01:05:41,708 --> 01:05:44,125
That drill has been repeating itself for the past few years now.

700
01:05:44,625 --> 01:05:45,458
But that's all they do.

701
01:05:45,958 --> 01:05:48,000
They see. Then they leave. And that's it.

702
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:52,000
Why's that?

703
01:06:00,541 --> 01:06:04,041
Because of this?

704
01:06:11,041 --> 01:06:13,125
Can I tell you something?

705
01:06:13,625 --> 01:06:17,125
You're much likelier to get married if you stop wearing these glasses.

706
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:29,333
It's okay.

707
01:07:21,125 --> 01:07:25,416
Everything you'll need is here. Garbage is collected at nine in the morn

708
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:29,375
All the grocery items are up at the top.

709
01:07:29,875 --> 01:07:33,375
The job is for five days. I'm going out of town.

710
01:07:33,875 --> 01:07:38,958
My father and all the housework needs to be taken care of.

711
01:07:39,458 --> 01:07:43,333
-Do we sleep here? -Here, or in the bedroom. Your wish.

712
01:07:43,833 --> 01:07:45,041
The washroom is down the hall.

713
01:07:45,541 --> 01:07:49,750
-Is he able to walk on his own. -Yes. Why?

714
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:52,125
Can he use the washroom on his own or do we need to drag him?

715
01:07:52,625 --> 01:07:56,125
Why are you talking like that?

716
01:08:05,166 --> 01:08:07,041
So, that's him. He needs to be looked after.

717
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:13,666
His three meals a day; his errands. That's about it.

718
01:08:14,166 --> 01:08:16,291
-Rs. 1000 a day? -How about 500?

719
01:08:16,791 --> 01:08:20,291
Okay, that's fine. Is there Wi-fi here?

720
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:28,625
Yes, there's Wi-fi. Give me your phone. I'll put in the password.

721
01:08:41,416 --> 01:08:44,916
Oh dad, I'll be back in five days, once the trial period ends.

722
01:08:45,416 --> 01:08:48,541
It's a private hospital, so the salary's good.

723
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:55,250
And I'll be working here full-time. So, it's not like I'm leaving the city forever.

724
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:59,333
You don't want me to go?

725
01:08:59,833 --> 01:09:01,000
Can I... come with you?

726
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,958
You can't come with me, daddy. You know that.

727
01:09:04,458 --> 01:09:05,625
I'm going to miss you.

728
01:09:06,125 --> 01:09:09,625
Deenu will look after you. Don't you worry.

729
01:09:16,833 --> 01:09:20,750
-Phone...me... -Of course I'll call you, dad.

730
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:24,041
Where did we stop at last time?

731
01:09:24,541 --> 01:09:30,583
The dark clouds conquered the once shimmering moon

732
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:36,500
Giving life to the resting demons of the jungle

733
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,708
And capturing the travellers of the night

734
01:09:43,208 --> 01:09:44,583
I'll see you in few days, dad.

735
01:09:45,083 --> 01:09:47,291
The demons demanded blood of the travellers

736
01:09:47,791 --> 01:09:49,000
Bye, daddy.

737
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,958
The dark clouds conquered the once shimmering moon

738
01:09:53,458 --> 01:09:56,791
Ready to go?

739
01:09:57,291 --> 01:09:58,041
3321.

740
01:09:58,541 --> 01:10:02,125
The travellers cried back to the tyrannical clouds

741
01:10:02,625 --> 01:10:04,916
We want light.

742
01:10:05,416 --> 01:10:08,041
Hello Uncle.

743
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:12,041
When are we going for the bike ride?

744
01:10:52,041 --> 01:10:53,708
Off..Off...

745
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:57,708
What?

746
01:11:01,125 --> 01:11:04,625
Okay, I'll turn it off. Don't get so worked up.

747
01:11:08,291 --> 01:11:09,541
Go...

748
01:11:10,041 --> 01:11:12,000
You want me to go?

749
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:16,000
Who'll do the cleaning if I leave?

750
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:17,625
(mumbles) Go...

751
01:11:18,125 --> 01:11:22,416
I won't go. Miss Chetna has given me this job.

752
01:11:22,916 --> 01:11:28,000
(mumbles)

753
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:31,875
Go to your room. I won't put up with this the whole day.

754
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:35,875
If you're allergic to pop music, go listen to sermons.

755
01:11:48,208 --> 01:11:50,708
This is Alok. Age-37.

756
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:54,708
He's an officer in the Forest Department.

757
01:11:58,416 --> 01:12:02,958
Look at him -Murli. He's not concerned with the squint.

758
01:12:03,458 --> 01:12:08,041
He's currently unemployed. He's a writer in the film industry.

759
01:12:08,541 --> 01:12:12,791
Forget about it. The third option is not worth it.

760
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:16,791
But it's about time that your daughter starts making her home.

761
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:41,875
All good?

762
01:12:42,375 --> 01:12:45,125
Ok, we'll do the next exercise.

763
01:12:45,625 --> 01:12:52,458
Lift the clip, and place it like this.

764
01:12:52,958 --> 01:12:56,458
Let's go.

765
01:13:01,166 --> 01:13:05,125
That's it. Now, just clip it there.

766
01:13:05,625 --> 01:13:09,125
Keep trying.

767
01:13:14,583 --> 01:13:15,833
Very good, Mr. Jamun.

768
01:13:16,333 --> 01:13:19,833
Let's go for another one.

769
01:13:50,875 --> 01:13:54,708
(Indistinct mumbles)

770
01:13:55,208 --> 01:13:57,875
Oh my god!

771
01:13:58,375 --> 01:13:59,541
What have you done?

772
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:02,791
Uncle, that's enough.

773
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:04,041
Don't bathe again.

774
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:05,250
Go in the bathroom

775
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:07,666
Look at the mess you've made.

776
01:14:08,166 --> 01:14:09,958
You'll get me wet as well.

777
01:14:10,458 --> 01:14:13,125
Go in. Now, bathe in there.

778
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:16,583
Don't make me call up your daughter.

779
01:14:17,083 --> 01:14:20,583
Stay inside, and bathe.

780
01:14:23,416 --> 01:14:25,625
God, give me a break.

781
01:14:26,125 --> 01:14:28,125
What a pain this guy is-

782
01:14:28,625 --> 01:14:29,166
Holy-

783
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:32,750
Go in. What's your problem, oldie?

784
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:34,166
Bathe inside the bathroom.

785
01:14:34,666 --> 01:14:38,166
This guy and his antics...

786
01:16:37,458 --> 01:16:40,958
Are you all right?

787
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,416
Yeah Chetna.

788
01:16:59,916 --> 01:17:01,375
How's dad?

789
01:17:01,875 --> 01:17:04,000
The house lights were off; he got a little fright.

790
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:07,000
He's fine now. I've given him dopamine as well.

791
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:11,250
Thank you so much, Kewal.

792
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:14,541
If this continues, how will I work?

793
01:17:15,041 --> 01:17:20,500
It wasn't his fault. Deenu left the house with the lights off.

794
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,166
He scared.

795
01:17:23,666 --> 01:17:27,666
This is normal for a Parkinson's patient.

796
01:17:28,166 --> 01:17:31,000
Don't you worry. I'll take care of him.

797
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:35,000
-Is he okay now? -Yes. He's fine. Don't worry.

798
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:37,041
Lord Rama is the truth.

799
01:18:37,541 --> 01:18:39,541
Lord Rama is the truth.

800
01:18:40,041 --> 01:18:43,541
(funeral chanting)

801
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:05,000
(indistinct mumbles)

802
01:19:20,958 --> 01:19:23,083
Lord Rama is the truth.

803
01:19:23,583 --> 01:19:27,083
Lord Rama is the truth.

804
01:21:26,791 --> 01:21:30,291
Do you like Chetna?

805
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:15,833
Amar has left.

806
01:24:16,333 --> 01:24:20,250
Your daughter needs to make her home.
