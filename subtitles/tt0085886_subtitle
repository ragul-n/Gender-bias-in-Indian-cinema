1
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:21,845
- Hello Vikram.
- Yes brother?

2
00:01:22,143 --> 00:01:24,023
Everything is fine here. Come down.

3
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:25,746
Okay. I'll be down soon.

4
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:35,050
Mr. Sharma, he is landing.
I will leave now.

5
00:01:35,091 --> 00:01:36,724
Okay. Come on.

6
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:58,195
So Vikram, we finally caught you today.

7
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,081
So what if you've caught me?
You won't hang me, will you?

8
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:02,722
That is for the court to decide.

9
00:02:02,863 --> 00:02:06,383
You'll take me to the court
but you don't know that...

10
00:02:06,574 --> 00:02:09,767
...I have a friend called Amit
who's a renowned lawyer over here.

11
00:02:09,934 --> 00:02:14,075
- He will take me out of the prison very
easily. Do you understand? - Will see!

12
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:16,807
Forgive me, Your Honour.

13
00:02:17,456 --> 00:02:19,744
The court had to wait because of me but...

14
00:02:21,555 --> 00:02:22,454
...I was helpless.

15
00:02:22,932 --> 00:02:25,682
He's come, sir.
I had told you my friend would come...

16
00:02:25,844 --> 00:02:26,614
...look, he's come.

17
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,693
Quiet please.

18
00:02:28,823 --> 00:02:29,901
But what's all this?

19
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:31,799
Some evidence, Your Honour.

20
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:36,750
And plenty of evidence like these are
waiting outside the court to testify.

21
00:02:38,836 --> 00:02:40,227
Have a look at this child.

22
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:44,011
He's 10 years old, Your Honour, and...

23
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:46,612
...I've just brought
him from a nearby lane.

24
00:02:48,464 --> 00:02:50,429
This child smokes at a very young age...

25
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:51,846
...that too a cigarette filled with drugs.

26
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:54,477
And this,

27
00:02:56,556 --> 00:02:59,824
this child has an ecstasy
pill along with his tea.

28
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,928
And this young boy...

29
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:07,335
...till the time he doesn't
get to taste cocaine,

30
00:03:07,376 --> 00:03:10,296
his body shivers as if
suffering from malaria.

31
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,886
What do you intend to prove by all this?

32
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,422
What I want to prove, Your Honour...

33
00:03:16,426 --> 00:03:20,028
...is that these kids,
till the time they don't get drugs,

34
00:03:20,053 --> 00:03:23,178
will commit robbery,
murders and loot people!

35
00:03:24,228 --> 00:03:26,064
That means in the coming few years...

36
00:03:26,491 --> 00:03:28,608
...this country will become
a haven for criminals.

37
00:03:29,195 --> 00:03:32,949
Because of few such people...

38
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:35,714
...who are interested
only in their own profit,

39
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:40,886
are forcing these kids to
get into such bad habits,

40
00:03:41,432 --> 00:03:42,466
should be destroyed.

41
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:43,546
Who are those people?

42
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:45,682
There are a lot of people, Your Honour.

43
00:03:45,796 --> 00:03:47,842
Right now,
their leader is my friend Vikram.

44
00:03:48,397 --> 00:03:49,961
Who is standing in front
of me in the witness box.

45
00:03:49,987 --> 00:03:51,464
What nonsense are you talking about?

46
00:03:51,516 --> 00:03:53,636
Are you here to fight the case
for me or to put me in trouble?

47
00:03:53,661 --> 00:03:55,415
I'm not here to put you into
trouble, my friend.

48
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:57,721
I'm trying to help you out...

49
00:03:57,746 --> 00:03:59,668
...from the criminal activities
that you have gotten into.

50
00:03:59,693 --> 00:04:01,185
This is a conspiracy, Mr. Judge!

51
00:04:01,315 --> 00:04:03,648
This lawyer of mine has
joined hands with the police.

52
00:04:03,762 --> 00:04:06,006
To earn a good reputation,
he's trying to frame me.

53
00:04:06,031 --> 00:04:13,284
How have I ensnared you?
Did I hook this child to drugs?

54
00:04:13,913 --> 00:04:17,462
And the others who are outside,
are their lives so cheap?

55
00:04:19,877 --> 00:04:20,830
Your Honour!

56
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:26,514
Every father has a dream that
one day his son will grow up,

57
00:04:27,097 --> 00:04:28,594
and support him in his old age.

58
00:04:29,316 --> 00:04:31,131
The same is with our society too.

59
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,447
Our country too has a wish
that the new generation...

60
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,573
...will take up the
responsibilities of the country.

61
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:41,142
But until such a time
that we have such people,

62
00:04:42,174 --> 00:04:45,176
who drive the new generation
into the evil habits of drugs,

63
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:47,719
the future of our country is doomed.

64
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,158
What one should do with
the enemies of the society,

65
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,164
is your decision, Your Honour.

66
00:04:53,997 --> 00:04:54,904
That's all.

67
00:04:59,602 --> 00:05:05,089
Vikram Singh,
as per the documents and evidence...

68
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:24,916
Vikram.

69
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,948
Don't misunderstand me, my friend.

70
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:32,216
This punishment will
make you a better person.

71
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:33,695
And I'm waiting for that day.

72
00:05:52,572 --> 00:05:55,202
Janki, have you called Amit?

73
00:05:55,591 --> 00:06:00,478
Oh dear, he will be coming soon.
Please don't move, your highness.

74
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,572
I am sorry.

75
00:06:05,668 --> 00:06:08,066
Mona, give me my diamond necklace.

76
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:16,008
My Lady...

77
00:06:25,132 --> 00:06:26,144
Good evening My Lady.

78
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:28,248
Looks like you got done
from court early today.

79
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:29,215
Yes ma'am.

80
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:42,642
- Janki, Janki!
- Yes!

81
00:06:43,247 --> 00:06:46,018
- Oh, when did you come?
- Where are you lost?

82
00:06:47,517 --> 00:06:49,386
Isn't that a beautiful necklace?

83
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:55,056
If the Queen doesn't have
such a necklace, who will?

84
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:56,327
Thank you Amit.

85
00:06:57,553 --> 00:07:00,022
How much is this necklace worth?

86
00:07:00,717 --> 00:07:02,557
Some years back it was
a few crores of rupees.

87
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:05,176
I don't know how
much it will be now.

88
00:07:22,563 --> 00:07:24,884
Don't open your eyes.

89
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:28,053
Now you can open your eyes.

90
00:07:31,248 --> 00:07:31,928
This!

91
00:07:33,447 --> 00:07:35,330
This,

92
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:38,568
this is the same necklace.
It's Queen of Palanpur's...

93
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:41,436
Yes. Didn't I tell you I would give you,

94
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:46,731
a diamond necklace some day? So I got it.

95
00:07:47,493 --> 00:07:49,992
But we cannot afford to pay
for this in ten lifetimes.

96
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:53,503
- But I paid it off in this life itself.
- Where did you get it from?

97
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:54,651
From the market.

98
00:07:55,788 --> 00:07:57,721
- Where did the money come from?
- From the bank.

99
00:07:57,834 --> 00:08:02,154
From the bank? But we have barely
five thousand rupees in the bank.

100
00:08:02,187 --> 00:08:03,456
This costs crores.

101
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:05,555
You think I've stolen it?

102
00:08:06,488 --> 00:08:09,870
I have paid for it.
I have a receipt for it.

103
00:08:09,895 --> 00:08:13,703
It is in my coat pocket. Take it out.

104
00:08:20,705 --> 00:08:21,519
Fifteen hundred?

105
00:08:23,681 --> 00:08:27,588
You really scared me.
I thought you brought the same one.

106
00:08:28,193 --> 00:08:29,593
Look my dear wife.

107
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:38,107
If I were capable, I would adorn
you with diamonds from head to foot.

108
00:08:39,492 --> 00:08:40,583
But what can I do?

109
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:45,792
My wife doesn't allow me to fight
false cases and I cannot lie.

110
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:48,630
But this necklace is more
valuable to me than that one.

111
00:08:49,315 --> 00:08:52,226
This has your decency and
trueness shinning through.

112
00:08:52,495 --> 00:08:54,575
Like hell it is shinning.
It is an imitation.

113
00:08:54,851 --> 00:08:57,438
So what if it is an imitation?
It is very dear to me.

114
00:08:58,127 --> 00:08:59,311
This is your love for me.

115
00:09:05,156 --> 00:09:09,721
"Wherever I see..."

116
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:21,880
"...I see your picture."

117
00:09:53,101 --> 00:09:59,857
"Wherever I see, I see your picture."

118
00:09:59,937 --> 00:10:10,015
"Wherever I see, I see your picture."

119
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:27,065
"I saw my future in your face."

120
00:10:50,748 --> 00:10:56,618
"I'm living for you."

121
00:10:57,534 --> 00:11:02,241
"My entire life is for you."

122
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:10,144
"Whatever is mine is yours."

123
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:15,476
"Now nothing is mine."

124
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:27,662
"My happiness belongs to you."

125
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:44,893
"Wherever I see, I see your picture."

126
00:12:07,948 --> 00:12:10,929
"Without seeing..."

127
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,242
"...without knowing,"

128
00:12:14,747 --> 00:12:19,037
"we are attached to each other."

129
00:12:21,151 --> 00:12:32,665
"We'll never separate from each other."

130
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:44,509
"Your feelings are like my handkerchief."

131
00:12:51,210 --> 00:13:00,812
"Wherever I see, I see your picture."

132
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:17,652
"I saw my future in your face."

133
00:13:28,298 --> 00:13:32,111
- This is sheer cheating.
- Yes. What did you tell me?

134
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:35,184
I should lead a decent man's life
being released from jail, right?

135
00:13:35,296 --> 00:13:38,537
I tried really hard. But these people
play mischief with a decent man.

136
00:13:38,562 --> 00:13:41,900
Listen ask your friend for tea?

137
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,399
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

138
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:47,068
Janki, this is my friend, Vikram.

139
00:13:47,148 --> 00:13:49,650
Sister-in-law, the thing is,
we studied together.

140
00:13:49,867 --> 00:13:54,340
I studied and remained illiterate
and he became a successful lawyer.

141
00:13:54,525 --> 00:13:57,234
- Please have some tea.
- Will you have some tea?

142
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:01,867
No this is not the time for tea.
You tell me what to do now.

143
00:14:02,003 --> 00:14:04,925
Don't worry. I'm with you.
I will talk to him.

144
00:14:05,185 --> 00:14:07,812
No, pal. There is no use of talking.

145
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:12,129
When I told him I would go to you
and you would take care of things,

146
00:14:12,326 --> 00:14:17,107
he swore at you. He said I have a
dozen such lawyers in my pocket.

147
00:14:17,308 --> 00:14:19,947
And you know what else he said?
Said, if you try to teach him the law,

148
00:14:19,988 --> 00:14:21,512
he'll besmear your reputation.

149
00:14:22,274 --> 00:14:23,537
- Really?
- Yes, that's what he said.

150
00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:26,286
Okay, let's see how he does that.
Where is he right now?

151
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,679
- What is that NT, NT...
- Yes, India NT House...

152
00:14:29,704 --> 00:14:33,612
Yes, he will be in that NT House.
You do one thing, you go there.

153
00:14:33,817 --> 00:14:36,579
My aunty is leaving for pilgrimage.

154
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,012
I will drop her at the station and come.

155
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,285
I will come there. You go ahead, okay?

156
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:50,745
- Mr. Rajan...
- You?

157
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:56,582
You are cheating Vikram by taking
over his fields, land and house.

158
00:14:57,218 --> 00:14:58,036
What cheating?

159
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,347
You were partners in the
profits and losses, weren't you?

160
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:03,435
Yes, we were.

161
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,754
When you underwent
losses, you shared them.

162
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,291
But you did not give him
his share of the profits.

163
00:15:09,022 --> 00:15:09,859
What profits?

164
00:15:10,735 --> 00:15:14,715
The prize money you got from
having him arrested. That profit.

165
00:15:14,901 --> 00:15:15,482
What?

166
00:15:15,728 --> 00:15:20,704
And one more thing, Mr. Rajan,
a man who can send his friend to jail,

167
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:24,411
can go to any lengths
to deliver him justice.

168
00:15:24,587 --> 00:15:27,434
Go to hell.
Give somebody else these threats.

169
00:15:27,871 --> 00:15:30,159
I am not foolish and stupid like Vikram.

170
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,888
That's for sure.

171
00:15:33,348 --> 00:15:36,407
A man who leaves the door
open and stuffs cocaine...

172
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:40,720
...in statues stolen from
temples, has to be clever.

173
00:15:41,321 --> 00:15:43,800
Anyway, the police will
decide on your outcome.

174
00:15:50,122 --> 00:15:53,136
I will decide on the
outcome, not the police.

175
00:15:53,981 --> 00:15:55,032
Put the phone down.

176
00:16:37,545 --> 00:16:40,940
Amit, Amit, what have you done?
You killed him for no reason...

177
00:16:40,988 --> 00:16:43,000
No I didn't do anything...

178
00:16:43,057 --> 00:16:46,237
I just asked you to make him
understand, not kill him...

179
00:16:46,262 --> 00:16:48,379
But, I didn't fire the bullet.

180
00:16:48,451 --> 00:16:50,875
You pulled the trigger in front
of me and you say you didn't...

181
00:16:50,954 --> 00:16:53,432
No Vikram. I don't know how it went off...

182
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:56,856
Okay, I agree with you.
But seeing all this...

183
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,273
...getting your finger prints on the
gun, who will believe you?

184
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,621
- Do you have proof?
- You Vikram...

185
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,267
You saw everything, you are my proof.

186
00:17:05,456 --> 00:17:06,546
Are you not my friend?

187
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:07,126
Friend!

188
00:17:07,696 --> 00:17:10,324
When you sent me to jail,
you forgot about friendship, my friend.

189
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,407
Vikram, I did that to
make you a human being.

190
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,323
Oh go to hell. The mother who gave
me birth couldn't make me a human.

191
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:17,878
How will you accomplish it?
Go. Get out of here.

192
00:17:18,096 --> 00:17:19,320
I'll not run away.

193
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,028
Jail is a dim place to be in.
I've just come from there.

194
00:17:25,107 --> 00:17:27,843
It is easy to send someone there,
but difficult to go there yourself.

195
00:17:28,136 --> 00:17:31,495
- Listen to me, go away from here.
- No Vikram. I will not go.

196
00:17:31,536 --> 00:17:33,241
Okay, don't go for yourself.

197
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,489
But think of sister-in-law,
of your unborn child.

198
00:17:37,835 --> 00:17:39,946
Think about them. Go run.

199
00:17:45,972 --> 00:17:48,188
- What'll happen, now?
- But Janki, I've no witness...

200
00:17:48,229 --> 00:17:50,575
...to prove that I did
not commit the murder.

201
00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:54,536
There's Vikram but even he is against me.

202
00:17:55,206 --> 00:17:56,313
Now what?

203
00:17:58,178 --> 00:17:59,992
- I'll go from here.
- Where are you going?

204
00:18:00,336 --> 00:18:02,694
- Anywhere, but far from here.
- I'll come with you.

205
00:18:02,735 --> 00:18:04,963
No Janki, you cannot come
with me in this state.

206
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:06,884
And who knows what I have to suffer.

207
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:09,065
- I'll not allow you to go alone.
- Janki, listen to me.

208
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,656
- You cannot come with me.
- I beg of you.

209
00:18:12,005 --> 00:18:15,343
Don't leave me alone.
I will die without you.

210
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,745
I cannot live without you, I cannot.

211
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:40,002
Janki...

212
00:18:44,354 --> 00:18:45,096
Janki!

213
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:46,338
Excuse me!

214
00:18:46,924 --> 00:18:49,875
Please move? I'm a doctor. Please move.

215
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,706
Don't worry. Please get a glass of water.

216
00:18:58,348 --> 00:19:00,951
This happens in pregnancy.
Please get a glass of water.

217
00:19:00,992 --> 00:19:01,651
Okay.

218
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,136
May I have a glass of water please?

219
00:19:20,978 --> 00:19:22,135
Sir, water.

220
00:19:52,097 --> 00:19:54,346
- Where is he? Has he not come?

221
00:19:54,376 --> 00:19:55,676
He will be here.

222
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:02,034
- The train is leaving.
- You rest. He will be here.

223
00:20:49,052 --> 00:20:51,177
Janki!

224
00:20:54,453 --> 00:21:00,421
- No, I don't wish to live...
- Janki.

225
00:21:00,576 --> 00:21:04,807
Doctor, why did you save me?

226
00:21:05,101 --> 00:21:10,639
I don't want to live without my husband.

227
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:12,264
If he's been separated from you today,

228
00:21:12,324 --> 00:21:14,450
if God's willing,
he will come back to you too.

229
00:21:14,784 --> 00:21:20,406
I cannot live a single
moment without him, doctor.

230
00:21:23,987 --> 00:21:25,751
Janki, take this...

231
00:21:26,111 --> 00:21:27,757
...remember your husband.

232
00:21:28,548 --> 00:21:31,845
Nurture him. Make him a good human being.

233
00:21:32,538 --> 00:21:36,195
And when you find him,
welcome him with this gift.

234
00:24:08,658 --> 00:24:14,281
You've done me a great
favour by saving my daughter.

235
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,821
Else my soul would not have
found peace even after death.

236
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:26,279
- You are a great man.
- Don't worry, you'll be all right.

237
00:24:26,642 --> 00:24:32,223
This wealth, this estate,
I bequeath to you from this day onward.

238
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,227
From today, you are Rana.

239
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:09,187
Uncle!

240
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:11,093
Uncle!

241
00:25:11,921 --> 00:25:12,960
Uncle!

242
00:25:13,913 --> 00:25:14,793
Where is uncle?

243
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:16,837
- Madam he's in Garden house.
- Okay.

244
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,882
Congratulations!

245
00:25:55,077 --> 00:25:56,132
Bahadur!

246
00:26:29,117 --> 00:26:37,507
You unfaithful man,
you have guts to do this? I'll kill you.

247
00:26:37,532 --> 00:26:41,665
Madhu, my child...

248
00:26:42,866 --> 00:26:43,959
Bahadur, you can go.

249
00:26:46,857 --> 00:26:48,049
I told him to do that.

250
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:50,370
You told him?

251
00:26:52,129 --> 00:26:52,803
Yes child.

252
00:26:54,999 --> 00:27:01,772
Every year on this day,
I punish myself with whip lashes.

253
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:04,046
You punish yourself?

254
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,800
But why?

255
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:11,008
Payback daughter.

256
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,895
My past does not let go of me.

257
00:27:15,908 --> 00:27:19,142
It's stuck to me like a scorpion.

258
00:27:19,992 --> 00:27:20,687
Uncle.

259
00:27:21,334 --> 00:27:24,530
I am a sinner, my child.

260
00:27:27,117 --> 00:27:28,903
I have committed a great sin.

261
00:27:31,406 --> 00:27:41,054
I left my wife and my unborn child
and ran away on this very day.

262
00:27:43,843 --> 00:27:48,077
She drowned and I was watching.

263
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,726
What wrong had I done to the society,

264
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:05,148
that my life fell into shambles?

265
00:28:06,984 --> 00:28:08,464
What wrong had I done...

266
00:28:10,654 --> 00:28:11,561
Uncle!

267
00:28:14,757 --> 00:28:17,384
Enough, uncle enough!

268
00:28:18,956 --> 00:28:20,967
Even I have lost everything.

269
00:28:22,145 --> 00:28:23,709
My mother died as I was born,

270
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,280
and a father within a year.

271
00:28:27,136 --> 00:28:30,307
If it weren't for you, what would I be?

272
00:28:31,094 --> 00:28:32,489
How would I have survived?

273
00:28:33,874 --> 00:28:36,725
I have forgotten my pain because of you.

274
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,507
Can you not do the same?

275
00:28:39,797 --> 00:28:41,631
Can you not forget your wounds?

276
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:45,438
Do you not take me as your daughter?

277
00:28:54,853 --> 00:28:57,462
Who else do I have other than
you in this whole world, child?

278
00:28:58,378 --> 00:29:02,257
If it weren't for you,
I would be dead long back.

279
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,710
Inspector Shankar is here.

280
00:29:38,062 --> 00:29:38,992
So you are dumb?

281
00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:43,986
Give me the stick.

282
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,011
Do you know what this is?

283
00:29:57,752 --> 00:30:01,956
Every criminal in India,
calls it the Sulemani stick.

284
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:05,898
Just looking at it,
a dumb person starts talking...

285
00:30:06,914 --> 00:30:08,825
...the blind gets his vision,

286
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,283
and the lame starts to run
at the speed of 100 mph.

287
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:16,475
I just got it out of a man's stomach.

288
00:30:19,101 --> 00:30:19,898
Yes!

289
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,759
He too was dumb like you.
He couldn't speak.

290
00:30:26,807 --> 00:30:31,196
I put this stick into his
mouth and gave it a push.

291
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:35,010
The stick went into his
stomach and he started talking.

292
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,501
He told me everything.

293
00:30:38,025 --> 00:30:47,664
But he had to be operated till three feet.
From the throat to the stomach.

294
00:30:48,643 --> 00:30:51,389
That's when the stick came out.

295
00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:55,264
What do you think?

296
00:30:57,475 --> 00:30:59,271
- Shall I...
- No, no, no, please don't...

297
00:31:04,707 --> 00:31:06,844
Who else is involved in
this business with you?

298
00:31:07,536 --> 00:31:09,113
No one...

299
00:31:10,898 --> 00:31:15,325
From which flight is the cocaine
coming from Nepal to India?

300
00:31:17,161 --> 00:31:19,641
- What flight is it coming by?
- Flight number 412 sir.

301
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:24,433
- Who is coming? Who is coming?
- Sir, Prem, sir.

302
00:32:08,147 --> 00:32:11,291
Porter, put the luggage in this car.

303
00:33:33,764 --> 00:33:36,010
- Give me this bag.
- No I won't.

304
00:33:36,301 --> 00:33:40,049
Give me the bag.

305
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:44,868
- Leave it else I'll...
- Leave my bag, leave my bag...

306
00:33:46,153 --> 00:33:46,962
Stick?

307
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,154
Catch him.

308
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:21,440
Take care of this fellow.

309
00:35:14,582 --> 00:35:17,353
My bag, my bag...

310
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,730
This is my bag.

311
00:38:29,347 --> 00:38:30,446
Collect it, from the police station.

312
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:42,792
- Hey you!
- Talk with respect, understood?

313
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:46,769
You are teaching me respect?
I want to make a phone call.

314
00:38:47,111 --> 00:38:49,235
This is a police station,
not a five star hotel.

315
00:38:49,977 --> 00:38:52,154
Have you ever seen a five
star hotel in your life?

316
00:38:52,891 --> 00:38:56,612
I own 5-6 hotels,
where I employ people like you.

317
00:38:57,111 --> 00:39:00,501
If you utter one more rude word,
I will forget you are a woman and...

318
00:39:00,542 --> 00:39:04,479
Then allow me a phone call.

319
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,778
What rule is this that
you imprison someone,

320
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:08,968
and don't even give her the
opportunity to save herself?

321
00:39:09,057 --> 00:39:10,759
Yes. Talk like this.

322
00:39:12,015 --> 00:39:12,929
Come on!

323
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:13,857
Constable...

324
00:39:23,671 --> 00:39:25,577
Yes. His name is Prem.

325
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,852
From Katmandu. On the 412.

326
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:34,304
Grey ambassador, DLL 2314.

327
00:39:35,237 --> 00:39:36,335
I want complete information.

328
00:39:41,626 --> 00:39:43,031
Now you will know who I am.

329
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:47,900
- Hey, go there.
- I'm going.

330
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:49,556
Who are you pointing out to?

331
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:52,676
You are not an inspector,
you are an executioner.

332
00:39:53,025 --> 00:39:54,049
Blank face.

333
00:39:58,151 --> 00:40:00,877
Shankar, what have you done?

334
00:40:00,902 --> 00:40:04,297
Mother, what are you doing here?
You have arrested my guest.

335
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,564
- Your guest?
- Her name is Manju.

336
00:40:07,631 --> 00:40:09,475
I am Manju.

337
00:40:10,721 --> 00:40:14,401
Look mother, she has cocaine in her bag.
She is a smuggler.

338
00:40:15,073 --> 00:40:19,074
What nonsense are you talking? She is the
daughter of Nepal's Rana Ranbir Singh.

339
00:40:19,634 --> 00:40:20,681
How do you know?

340
00:40:21,251 --> 00:40:23,611
He has been corresponding
with me for many months.

341
00:40:23,806 --> 00:40:25,972
His business has spread
all over the world.

342
00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:29,896
Why would an offspring from such
a family carry cocaine in her bag?

343
00:40:30,016 --> 00:40:33,747
I told him, aunty.
But it didn't register in his brain.

344
00:40:36,956 --> 00:40:38,787
What are you contemplating? Release her.

345
00:40:40,565 --> 00:40:43,412
- How can I release her without a surety?
- I'll stand as her surety.

346
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:44,969
- You will?
- Yes I will.

347
00:40:45,991 --> 00:40:49,023
- Look mother, that could cause trouble...
- I am responsible for that.

348
00:40:49,627 --> 00:40:52,480
No mother, I will not release
her like that. I need proper surety.

349
00:40:52,885 --> 00:40:55,054
What do you mean by
a proper surety, inspector?

350
00:40:55,718 --> 00:40:56,719
I am Janki Devi.

351
00:40:57,075 --> 00:41:01,563
Famous sculptist, painter,
BRKRI national award winner.

352
00:41:01,946 --> 00:41:03,456
I am a standing surety for Manju.

353
00:41:03,573 --> 00:41:05,143
Give me the papers. I'll sign.

354
00:41:15,387 --> 00:41:19,197
Amazing man. If you can't trust
your mother, where do others stand!

355
00:41:23,757 --> 00:41:24,251
Constable!

356
00:41:30,637 --> 00:41:32,171
I'm sorry child. Come on.

357
00:41:42,331 --> 00:41:44,967
My son is very strict as
far as law is concerned.

358
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,108
It's all right, aunty.

359
00:41:48,226 --> 00:41:50,419
By the way, it's been
how many years that he last smiled?

360
00:41:51,214 --> 00:41:51,603
Why?

361
00:41:52,471 --> 00:41:56,071
It appears he has forgotten
to laugh and smile.

362
00:41:58,172 --> 00:42:01,341
Daughter, whose statue
do you wish to get made?

363
00:42:02,262 --> 00:42:03,820
Of my late father.

364
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,721
- Oh! You have his picture?
- O yes.

365
00:42:20,107 --> 00:42:22,069
Who all are there in your family?

366
00:42:24,721 --> 00:42:27,042
Aunty, my mother died
after giving me birth.

367
00:42:28,306 --> 00:42:30,746
My father died when
I was merely one year old.

368
00:42:31,545 --> 00:42:33,713
My uncle has done my upbringing.

369
00:42:34,273 --> 00:42:35,799
He means everything to me.

370
00:42:36,441 --> 00:42:39,026
- He's truly a great man.
- Is it?

371
00:42:39,546 --> 00:42:40,370
Yes, aunty.

372
00:42:40,793 --> 00:42:43,256
When you meet him, you will believe me.

373
00:42:44,586 --> 00:42:45,986
Here is his photo.

374
00:42:46,889 --> 00:42:48,753
Excuse me, I'll be back.

375
00:42:52,795 --> 00:42:55,365
- Hello. Mrs. Gupta?
- Yes. How are you?

376
00:42:55,507 --> 00:42:58,756
- I learnt that you too are on Karva
chauth's fast? - Yes.

377
00:42:58,797 --> 00:43:01,809
- Where will everyone gather?
- At my place. To see the moon.

378
00:43:01,889 --> 00:43:04,139
Mrs. Jagdish too wants to join.

379
00:43:04,408 --> 00:43:05,678
- Mrs. Jagdish?
- Yes.

380
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,541
Yes, yes. I'll inform her.
What's her number?

381
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:10,029
- 39...
- One second.

382
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:18,312
395846 okay.

383
00:43:28,551 --> 00:43:30,899
At least smile in your picture.

384
00:43:31,265 --> 00:43:33,829
Looks like you've had bitter medicine.

385
00:43:35,712 --> 00:43:39,452
Smile sometimes. It keeps up the health.

386
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:44,229
Just a little bit.

387
00:43:45,209 --> 00:43:47,342
Little more, more...

388
00:43:48,403 --> 00:43:51,685
Oh, not so much. Your jaw will tear off.

389
00:43:52,757 --> 00:43:53,554
Little less.

390
00:43:55,464 --> 00:43:58,042
Yes that's right.

391
00:43:58,753 --> 00:44:02,917
- Child, who are you talking to?
- Oh, no one.

392
00:44:03,189 --> 00:44:06,712
I was going to ask you,
do you live her alone?

393
00:44:07,013 --> 00:44:10,923
- No, with my son.
- And your husband?

394
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:15,061
He, he isn't here right now.

395
00:44:15,806 --> 00:44:19,544
- Is he in the police force too?
- No, he practices law.

396
00:44:20,402 --> 00:44:22,453
Aunty, you are such a warm person.

397
00:44:23,045 --> 00:44:25,499
But it looks like your
son is like your husband.

398
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:26,358
Not at all.

399
00:44:28,221 --> 00:44:31,567
I'm like my mother.
I have nothing to do with that man.

400
00:44:32,072 --> 00:44:35,766
Shankar, you know I do not like
to hear anything against him.

401
00:44:36,071 --> 00:44:39,551
The truth is what you have to hear.
What did he do for us?

402
00:44:41,326 --> 00:44:46,916
What can I say about a man who left
his pregnant wife and ran away.

403
00:44:48,418 --> 00:44:51,070
Who did not even think that the
child would need a father...

404
00:44:51,535 --> 00:44:52,762
...when he grows up.

405
00:44:53,495 --> 00:44:56,984
That he would need his shoulder,
his finger to walk by!

406
00:44:59,591 --> 00:45:01,756
Did he think of what the
child would feel watching,

407
00:45:02,181 --> 00:45:04,154
other's fathers and sons?

408
00:45:05,027 --> 00:45:06,810
He was compelled.

409
00:45:06,843 --> 00:45:08,409
He was not compelled, he was a coward.

410
00:45:08,434 --> 00:45:08,972
Shankar!

411
00:45:09,811 --> 00:45:10,950
Look mother, he is a criminal.

412
00:45:11,928 --> 00:45:15,057
And if I ever meet him,
I'll handcuff him first,

413
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:16,904
- then I will speak to him.
- Shankar...

414
00:45:26,622 --> 00:45:29,660
- Where is he?
- Who is it?

415
00:45:32,019 --> 00:45:33,003
Who are you?

416
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:41,169
I am Gunda Petha Rao D Raghwan D.T.M.S.

417
00:45:41,383 --> 00:45:42,265
D.T.M.S.

418
00:45:42,602 --> 00:45:45,875
Day time murder specialist.

419
00:45:46,506 --> 00:45:51,297
But, what have you come here for?

420
00:45:51,439 --> 00:45:55,523
You are a lawyer, you save
the murderer, so I have got this here.

421
00:45:57,103 --> 00:46:01,831
I have murdered her and got her here.

422
00:46:02,203 --> 00:46:05,188
Now you have to save me
from getting hanged.

423
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:10,569
How can I save you?

424
00:46:10,703 --> 00:46:13,772
To save you I will have to
fight your case in the court.

425
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:21,271
I do not go to the court,
you will have to save me here itself.

426
00:46:21,721 --> 00:46:23,738
I don't have time to go to the court
because I want to commit another,

427
00:46:23,851 --> 00:46:27,591
five murders and get their corpse here.

428
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:33,562
Five murders? Please find some
other lawyer I don't have time.

429
00:46:33,721 --> 00:46:35,103
Mr. Shastri...

430
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:36,618
Yes boss!

431
00:46:40,229 --> 00:46:45,191
Sir, he is a lawyer too he will fight
your case because I lose all the...

432
00:46:45,271 --> 00:46:50,214
...cases that I fight.
Ask him to fight your case.

433
00:46:54,784 --> 00:46:56,552
Only you will save me.

434
00:46:56,852 --> 00:46:59,988
Or else if this gets close to
your neck then your head...

435
00:47:00,013 --> 00:47:01,957
...will go flying on
that playground outside.

436
00:47:02,437 --> 00:47:05,555
And those boys will play with it...

437
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,773
- ...like a football.
- No...

438
00:47:07,798 --> 00:47:10,167
Janki, Janki.

439
00:47:13,785 --> 00:47:16,556
Save me, Janki.

440
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:19,240
Please forgive me.

441
00:47:19,281 --> 00:47:22,010
What is the matter? What happened?

442
00:47:22,112 --> 00:47:25,179
Janki. He wants to kill me.

443
00:47:25,215 --> 00:47:26,718
Save me.

444
00:47:26,978 --> 00:47:31,455
No, please don't hurt him,
please spare him, I request, I beg...

445
00:47:31,507 --> 00:47:32,735
Mother, what are you doing?

446
00:47:33,109 --> 00:47:36,672
- Mother?
- Janki this is the voice of...

447
00:47:36,984 --> 00:47:38,816
Guru.

448
00:47:40,184 --> 00:47:44,224
Not only the voice but
the face also belongs to Guru.

449
00:47:45,017 --> 00:47:48,330
Mother, here after so many
efforts I prepared this drama.

450
00:47:48,829 --> 00:47:51,695
You just ruined it.

451
00:47:51,823 --> 00:47:54,057
- This was a drama?
- Yes.

452
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:57,381
- And whose corpse is that?
- Corpse, corpse?

453
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:04,307
Corpse, come here.

454
00:48:04,332 --> 00:48:05,088
- Hey come here!
- Yes!

455
00:48:07,209 --> 00:48:09,938
- Who is she son?
- I am the heroin for his new play.

456
00:48:10,111 --> 00:48:11,080
Tara!

457
00:48:11,105 --> 00:48:20,518
The star of tomorrow, she is Megha.
This is called art, acting.

458
00:48:20,866 --> 00:48:27,932
- Now I shall get out the actor from you.
- Mother save me, mother...

459
00:48:27,957 --> 00:48:31,394
- Save me mother!
- Move Janki!

460
00:48:31,544 --> 00:48:36,412
What are you doing, your son has
grown up now, still you beat him.

461
00:48:36,509 --> 00:48:39,399
If I don't beat him
he will ruin my reputation.

462
00:48:39,588 --> 00:48:42,615
Waster, joker, good for nothing.

463
00:48:44,006 --> 00:48:47,408
Give me a chance to work,
give me more thousand rupees.

464
00:48:47,533 --> 00:48:48,714
And then see what I do.

465
00:48:48,873 --> 00:48:52,057
I shall write such a play that
the whole world will appreciate.

466
00:48:52,136 --> 00:48:54,724
I shall become such a famous actor...

467
00:48:55,292 --> 00:49:01,007
...that the young, the old, male, female,

468
00:49:01,057 --> 00:49:09,455
the earth and the skies will say,
''look a simple lawyers' son...''

469
00:49:09,558 --> 00:49:10,558
Quiet!

470
00:49:11,356 --> 00:49:15,043
- Is the king of acting,
a simple lawyer's son... - Quiet!

471
00:49:16,234 --> 00:49:18,545
Is the king of acting.
A simple lawyer's son....

472
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:23,426
- I will not give you a single rupee.
- One minute.

473
00:49:28,471 --> 00:49:31,799
- What did you say?
- I will not give you a single rupee.

474
00:49:31,824 --> 00:49:33,072
- You'll not give me a single rupee?
- No.

475
00:49:33,122 --> 00:49:34,882
- You will not?
- Never!

476
00:49:34,907 --> 00:49:39,507
Mother, if I am not
able to play this drama,

477
00:49:39,665 --> 00:49:44,038
I shall kill myself with this axe.

478
00:49:44,384 --> 00:49:46,728
No, no son please don't do that.

479
00:49:48,457 --> 00:49:50,434
Why are you playing with
the life of my son...

480
00:49:50,459 --> 00:49:51,907
...for just more thousand rupees.

481
00:49:52,019 --> 00:49:55,241
This actor doesn't know
the reality of life yet.

482
00:49:55,376 --> 00:49:57,376
If that is the case,
I am killing myself...

483
00:49:57,401 --> 00:50:02,241
No, my son, please give him the money...

484
00:50:03,118 --> 00:50:08,093
I beg of you.
Why are you making me a barren woman?

485
00:50:08,261 --> 00:50:12,708
What nonsense is this?
He is acting and you believe him?

486
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:14,594
I will bring the money.

487
00:50:23,031 --> 00:50:25,684
Mother, you are great.

488
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,778
You have spewed
an old dialogue and saved me.

489
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:32,004
Why are you making me a barren woman?

490
00:50:32,807 --> 00:50:33,432
Wow!

491
00:50:34,151 --> 00:50:37,767
This dialogue has been sold in films...

492
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:40,051
...and drama's for the last 100 years.

493
00:51:08,176 --> 00:51:09,614
"Hey Gadku!"

494
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:11,918
"Oh Pandya!"

495
00:51:12,372 --> 00:51:14,130
"Hey Dhondhya!"

496
00:51:14,841 --> 00:51:16,278
"Hey Gadhauprasad!"

497
00:51:17,091 --> 00:51:18,654
"Mr. Amachan!"

498
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,857
"Hey Mr. Bicchu!"

499
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:23,857
"Hey Mr. Badbad Singh!"

500
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:25,419
"Hey welcome!"

501
00:51:25,701 --> 00:51:30,434
Listen to my story which
is filled with sorrow.

502
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:38,978
"The form of every country is different."

503
00:51:40,395 --> 00:51:43,826
"And the culture is also different."

504
00:51:44,245 --> 00:51:45,307
"What did you get?"

505
00:51:45,863 --> 00:51:50,060
"If you don't understand..."

506
00:51:50,744 --> 00:51:55,313
"...I'll explain it you."

507
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:11,577
"Every girl is a Queen here."

508
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:14,528
"Every boy is a King here."

509
00:52:14,839 --> 00:52:17,823
"Every girl is a Queen here."

510
00:52:18,326 --> 00:52:20,556
"Every boy is a King here."

511
00:52:20,796 --> 00:52:26,953
"But no music has ever been played here."

512
00:52:27,033 --> 00:52:33,544
"But no music has ever been played here."

513
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:36,802
"Every girl is a Queen here."

514
00:52:37,372 --> 00:52:39,880
"Every boy is a King here."

515
00:52:39,905 --> 00:52:45,936
"But no music has ever been played here."

516
00:52:46,245 --> 00:52:52,677
"But no music has ever been played here."

517
00:53:05,568 --> 00:53:08,716
"To see girls around,"

518
00:53:08,888 --> 00:53:11,888
"heartbeat is growing."

519
00:53:12,021 --> 00:53:13,716
"Oh great, amazing."

520
00:53:15,255 --> 00:53:18,419
"To see girls around,"

521
00:53:18,521 --> 00:53:21,599
"heartbeat is growing."

522
00:53:21,684 --> 00:53:27,950
"In the market, fragrance of
flowers, and tinkling of anklets."

523
00:53:40,874 --> 00:53:43,604
"Naughty girl..."

524
00:53:44,057 --> 00:53:46,737
"My sweetheart..."

525
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,075
"Sometimes swinging
and sometimes swaying."

526
00:53:50,322 --> 00:53:53,457
"Sometimes swinging
and sometimes swaying."

527
00:53:56,669 --> 00:53:58,083
"Sometimes hanging."

528
00:53:58,270 --> 00:53:59,685
"Sometimes throwing away."

529
00:53:59,894 --> 00:54:01,261
"Sometimes jerking."

530
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:02,872
"Sometimes swaggering."

531
00:54:03,388 --> 00:54:04,927
"Flexibility..."

532
00:54:04,952 --> 00:54:06,403
"Swaggering, throwing away."

533
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:09,619
"Turn around, where are you going?"

534
00:54:12,089 --> 00:54:18,095
"Every girl is a Queen here,
every boy is a King here."

535
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:24,327
"Every girl is a Queen here,
every boy is a King here."

536
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:30,844
"But no music has ever been played here."

537
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:37,552
"But no music has ever been played here."

538
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,383
"Listen..."

539
00:55:03,853 --> 00:55:10,194
"The lovers are fighting..."

540
00:55:13,682 --> 00:55:19,832
"The lovers are fighting..."

541
00:55:20,157 --> 00:55:26,350
"If the fighting gets serious,
weapons are out of the pocket."

542
00:55:29,616 --> 00:55:32,744
"They are beating with the
stick, so let's run."

543
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:35,877
"They are beating with the
stick, so let's run."

544
00:55:36,089 --> 00:55:39,091
"Hey people, watch the show."

545
00:55:39,439 --> 00:55:42,634
"Hey people, watch the show..."

546
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:48,578
"A pavilion of palm trees."

547
00:55:48,603 --> 00:55:50,158
"Sometimes scary tricks,
sometimes true work."

548
00:55:50,183 --> 00:55:52,361
"Sometimes a superior from Kurukshetra..."

549
00:55:52,978 --> 00:55:58,298
"...pavilion, sometimes scary tricks,
sometimes a superior from Kurukshetra."

550
00:55:58,377 --> 00:56:04,345
"Don't force my dear."

551
00:56:04,659 --> 00:56:07,877
"Let go of my hands."

552
00:56:08,004 --> 00:56:11,424
"Let me go, I beg you."

553
00:56:11,745 --> 00:56:14,883
"Turn around, where are you going?"

554
00:56:17,219 --> 00:56:22,841
"Every girl is a Queen here,
every boy is a King here."

555
00:56:23,732 --> 00:56:29,569
"Every girl is a Queen here,
every boy is a King here."

556
00:56:29,713 --> 00:56:35,849
"But no music has ever been played here."

557
00:56:36,071 --> 00:56:42,360
"But no music has ever been played here."

558
00:56:47,498 --> 00:56:49,040
"Hey Lord Shiva."

559
00:56:50,714 --> 00:56:55,165
"Let's see your miracle."

560
00:57:18,214 --> 00:57:24,960
"The leaders of the society
are flirting all night long."

561
00:57:25,016 --> 00:57:31,236
"The reality is that,
this market is growing under their roof."

562
00:57:31,472 --> 00:57:33,087
"Beware..."

563
00:57:33,112 --> 00:57:36,166
"Inspector, constable...."

564
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:38,343
"Catch all these goons."

565
00:57:38,447 --> 00:57:41,799
"And listen to their ill doings."

566
00:57:42,057 --> 00:57:45,710
"If you hear, you'll be shocked."

567
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:49,297
"The whole day they're
pretending to be a saint."

568
00:57:50,714 --> 00:57:52,959
"In the night they're lusty."

569
00:57:54,363 --> 00:57:58,008
"Look at these frauds..."

570
00:57:58,033 --> 00:58:01,904
"...in their view,
we're just like a fool."

571
00:58:03,299 --> 00:58:06,127
"He's engaged..."

572
00:58:06,152 --> 00:58:10,279
"...and she's here dancing."

573
00:58:10,538 --> 00:58:13,158
"He's engaged..."

574
00:58:13,197 --> 00:58:16,846
"...and she's here dancing."

575
00:58:17,167 --> 00:58:19,799
"Hey wait..."

576
00:58:19,878 --> 00:58:27,908
"How did you forget the contract
and fell into this well?"

577
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:28,955
"Come out!"

578
00:58:29,151 --> 00:58:33,155
"Turn around, where are you doing?"

579
00:58:35,104 --> 00:58:41,534
"Every girl is a Queen here,
every boy is a King here."

580
00:58:41,674 --> 00:58:47,534
"Every girl is a Queen here,
every boy is a King here."

581
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:53,916
"But no music has ever been played here."

582
00:58:54,081 --> 00:59:00,416
"But no music has ever been played here."

583
00:59:07,276 --> 00:59:12,268
My name is Gulshan Kawal...

584
00:59:17,692 --> 00:59:19,736
You're a useless fellow.

585
00:59:19,825 --> 00:59:23,501
Such a bad performance, so disrespectful.

586
00:59:23,974 --> 00:59:28,957
You're an arrogant father.

587
00:59:29,085 --> 00:59:30,902
Disrespectful boy!
Are you making fun of me?

588
00:59:30,927 --> 00:59:32,483
Forgive me, father, forgive me.

589
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,799
Forget the past.
Let's open a new account, okay?

590
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:38,148
Give me 3000 rupees.
We will produce another play.

591
00:59:38,173 --> 00:59:39,870
The unveiling of Draupadi.

592
00:59:40,238 --> 00:59:43,290
You shameless bugger.
I will not give you a single rupee.

593
00:59:43,392 --> 00:59:46,105
Get out of my house.
Go drown yourself in a fistful of water.

594
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:48,367
- Mother...
- What happened my son?

595
00:59:48,424 --> 00:59:54,304
Look mother, this insensitive man is
driving a great artiste to suicide.

596
00:59:54,447 --> 00:59:57,721
Let your enemies commit suicide.
Your mother is still alive.

597
00:59:57,761 --> 01:00:00,681
That's it mother, it is only for
these dialogues that I am alive.

598
01:00:00,823 --> 01:00:03,863
- Else this Gengis Khan...
- Look, look at him...

599
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:06,208
I am watching everything. Come here.

600
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,334
What were you like
before we got married...

601
01:00:14,806 --> 01:00:16,650
- She convinced him.
- Shut up.

602
01:00:17,167 --> 01:00:20,701
Mr. Rai has asked for a reply
for his granddaughters proposal.

603
01:00:21,783 --> 01:00:23,644
Oh! I'd forgotten all about it.

604
01:00:25,135 --> 01:00:30,494
My dear, my child, I'm so proud of you!

605
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,649
Oh! Change of scene?
This means it is a conspiracy.

606
01:00:34,888 --> 01:00:39,032
My son, you are talking of
Rs. 3000, I will give you one lakh.

607
01:00:39,712 --> 01:00:43,311
One lakh! This is definitely
a huge conspiracy.

608
01:00:43,368 --> 01:00:45,848
No my son,
there is no conspiracy behind this.

609
01:00:45,928 --> 01:00:51,257
I will get you a bride in one lakh.

610
01:00:51,549 --> 01:00:58,361
Oh! So you want to
bargain my bachelorhood?

611
01:01:04,859 --> 01:01:07,227
Okay, I accede to your bargain.

612
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:09,391
Well done my son,
I expected the same from you.

613
01:01:09,471 --> 01:01:12,271
But I didn't expect this from you!
Who is the girl?

614
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,695
Uncle, shut up!

615
01:01:14,924 --> 01:01:17,151
Whom did grandfather consult before
printing this in the newspaper?

616
01:01:17,699 --> 01:01:21,839
- Oh! You mustn't think like this.
- You are advising me?

617
01:01:21,941 --> 01:01:24,781
You think I'm a mannequin at an
exhibition to parade in front of people?

618
01:01:24,865 --> 01:01:27,395
Oh no, my girl, you don't have to do that.

619
01:01:27,523 --> 01:01:29,579
Just walk around and
take a look at the boys.

620
01:01:29,909 --> 01:01:33,059
Just look at them once?
I'll look at them just now!

621
01:01:33,979 --> 01:01:39,588
Once, twice, thrice and fourth time.

622
01:01:43,115 --> 01:01:47,242
Do anything my girl,
but just select a boy for marriage.

623
01:01:47,408 --> 01:01:48,468
- Shut up!

624
01:01:48,493 --> 01:01:51,283
I will not marry! Not marry! Not marry!

625
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:53,559
What did she say? She will not marry?

626
01:01:53,662 --> 01:01:55,079
Yes sir, she said just that.

627
01:01:55,201 --> 01:01:57,914
Did you hear this doctor?
Says she won't marry.

628
01:01:58,135 --> 01:02:02,398
Why have I called so many people?
To dance for my wedding?

629
01:02:02,727 --> 01:02:05,847
Okay, let her not marry.
But go and tell her.

630
01:02:05,945 --> 01:02:07,241
If she doesn't get married...

631
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:10,214
...I will donate my wealth
worth in crores, to orphanages.

632
01:02:10,329 --> 01:02:12,531
- Shut up.
- But sir, please rest now.

633
01:02:12,611 --> 01:02:15,451
I am telling you.
She will not get a dime from me.

634
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:17,840
This is my last decision. Go and tell her.

635
01:02:18,016 --> 01:02:20,429
Okay Mr. Rai, you sit.
I will explain everything to her.

636
01:02:20,478 --> 01:02:22,803
- What does she think of herself?
- You rest, you are not well.

637
01:02:22,907 --> 01:02:25,743
- Ramdeen, take care of sir.
- Won't get married...

638
01:02:25,768 --> 01:02:28,032
- Please rest...
- Give me that pill...

639
01:02:32,796 --> 01:02:36,592
- I have a double degree.
- But your face shows only one and a half.

640
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:42,075
I am a florist.
I will tend to you like a flower.

641
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,948
Go and get married to another florist.

642
01:02:47,498 --> 01:02:50,028
- Are you a wrestler?
- My father was a wrestler.

643
01:02:50,068 --> 01:02:51,802
Go and give a massage to someone.

644
01:02:53,778 --> 01:02:54,669
About me...

645
01:02:55,512 --> 01:02:56,966
- What about me?
- Shut up.

646
01:02:58,986 --> 01:03:01,442
- Excuse me dear.
- What is it dear?

647
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:04,020
You are too short and thin.

648
01:03:04,061 --> 01:03:08,438
The doctor has told me that I'll
become tall and stout after marriage.

649
01:03:08,479 --> 01:03:10,531
Then get married to some doctor.

650
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:16,600
What do you think about me?

651
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:21,019
My opinion of you is that
your voice is very thin!

652
01:03:22,036 --> 01:03:23,984
What's your opinion of this voice?

653
01:03:25,083 --> 01:03:28,363
How a pigeon takes a letter
to its destination...

654
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:31,757
...their wings are cut off with
scissors by the ones in love.

655
01:03:31,956 --> 01:03:35,885
The answer is that the pigeon will
take the letter in such a manner that,

656
01:03:36,209 --> 01:03:38,762
the message written on the wings,
is ready to get cut for love...

657
01:03:38,803 --> 01:03:39,406
Applause! So?

658
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:42,057
- Very nice!
- Great!

659
01:03:42,163 --> 01:03:43,563
What do you think?

660
01:03:44,566 --> 01:03:46,551
- The voice is good.
- And the face?

661
01:03:47,283 --> 01:03:50,145
It's okay, but the height is a bit much.

662
01:03:50,316 --> 01:03:53,948
Okay, so let's take this voice, someone
else's built, another ones face etc.

663
01:03:53,973 --> 01:03:59,236
Put it in a box and shake it,
you'll have the man as per your choice.

664
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,592
What do you think of yourself?

665
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:06,357
Have you come to find yourself a fiancé,

666
01:04:06,382 --> 01:04:07,755
or to buy vegetables?

667
01:04:07,819 --> 01:04:10,355
This one's too tall, this ones too
fat, this one's cockeyed,

668
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:11,868
just sit with us for 10 minutes,

669
01:04:12,084 --> 01:04:13,538
I'll give you all your bad
qualities on hearing which...

670
01:04:13,602 --> 01:04:15,102
- ...you will commit suicide.
- Be quiet.

671
01:04:15,127 --> 01:04:18,734
No. You be quiet. You invite us
to your home only to insult us?

672
01:04:18,916 --> 01:04:20,916
Come here, friends!

673
01:04:29,087 --> 01:04:33,645
This is an insult to us.

674
01:04:34,974 --> 01:04:37,157
This is an insult to our manhood.

675
01:04:38,447 --> 01:04:44,357
This woman has relied on her
wealth to make a monkey out of us.

676
01:04:45,907 --> 01:04:51,900
Before she fails us, let us fail her.

677
01:04:55,754 --> 01:05:04,456
All of us will get together
and form a fiancé union.

678
01:05:05,283 --> 01:05:07,477
We will stand on a raised platform...

679
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:12,434
...and raise our voices against
such proud and arrogant girls.

680
01:05:13,327 --> 01:05:15,776
We will burn their pride in ashes.

681
01:05:16,481 --> 01:05:17,528
Say labour...

682
01:05:18,851 --> 01:05:25,428
- Say fiancés union.
- Stay strong!

683
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:27,500
Ramdeen!

684
01:05:27,525 --> 01:05:31,448
- Fiances union.
- Stay strong!

685
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:39,051
- Dictatorship won't work!
- Won't work! Won't work!

686
01:05:39,111 --> 01:05:45,040
- Shame on Rita!
- Shame! Shame!

687
01:05:45,087 --> 01:05:48,165
Long live the revolution!

688
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:51,142
Long live the revolution!

689
01:05:51,259 --> 01:05:54,236
Long live the revolution!

690
01:05:54,322 --> 01:05:57,626
- Tommorow...
- Will bring colour...

691
01:05:58,790 --> 01:06:02,715
Useless girl,
chased everyone out didn't you?

692
01:06:02,942 --> 01:06:04,717
Made them leave after insulting them?

693
01:06:05,022 --> 01:06:07,951
I knew you would do just this.
Always pleasing yourself.

694
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:10,283
My wish will never be fulfilled.

695
01:06:10,579 --> 01:06:12,805
- I'll die...
- Grandfather...

696
01:06:13,311 --> 01:06:15,692
But you'll still want your way.

697
01:06:15,994 --> 01:06:17,598
Go do as you please, but be warned.

698
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:23,077
From now on you are no one
to me and I am no one to you.

699
01:06:23,304 --> 01:06:24,226
Ramadin!

700
01:06:24,308 --> 01:06:25,840
- Coming.
- Hurry up.

701
01:06:26,113 --> 01:06:26,949
- Come.
- Move away.

702
01:06:26,995 --> 01:06:28,485
- Come.
- Don't talk with me.

703
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:30,237
I have brought you up
with love and affection...

704
01:06:30,336 --> 01:06:31,477
...and this is the result of it.

705
01:06:37,658 --> 01:06:40,421
My girl, don't be so stubborn.

706
01:06:40,835 --> 01:06:42,107
Have you seen your grandfathers condition?

707
01:06:42,337 --> 01:06:44,547
If anything is to happen to
him what will the world say?

708
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:47,325
That a granddaughter has
taken her grandfathers life.

709
01:06:47,535 --> 01:06:48,406
Let them say it!

710
01:06:48,884 --> 01:06:52,016
Does that mean that I should
be stuck with some crooked...

711
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:54,408
...old chap for all of my life?

712
01:06:54,449 --> 01:06:58,188
But who says you have to do that?
You don't want to marry just yet,

713
01:06:58,458 --> 01:07:01,275
- but surely you can pretend to marry?
- Pretend?

714
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:04,300
- Yes act out a marriage.
- I didn't get it.

715
01:07:04,449 --> 01:07:07,930
That boy with the deep voice? Tall...

716
01:07:09,814 --> 01:07:12,751
- The one who gave the speech.
- That arrogant one!

717
01:07:12,826 --> 01:07:15,860
Listen to me. I've heard
that he is a very good actor.

718
01:07:16,338 --> 01:07:18,895
He wants to produce plays all the time.

719
01:07:18,936 --> 01:07:19,929
So what am I to do?

720
01:07:20,547 --> 01:07:24,838
But he doesn't have money.
If you offer him some money,

721
01:07:24,863 --> 01:07:27,870
he will pretend to be your husband.

722
01:07:28,446 --> 01:07:29,756
That'll appease your grandfather.

723
01:07:29,970 --> 01:07:33,229
Then you can get married to the boy
of your choice in your own time.

724
01:07:33,807 --> 01:07:34,807
A hired husband?

725
01:07:35,204 --> 01:07:39,315
What did you say? A hired husband?
Impossible, impossible...

726
01:07:39,611 --> 01:07:42,007
Thousands of girls queue up outside
my house like in a ration queue,

727
01:07:42,032 --> 01:07:43,713
to make me their husband.

728
01:07:43,754 --> 01:07:45,495
And you instead of making me a husband,

729
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,036
want to make me this!

730
01:07:47,093 --> 01:07:48,829
Go away, go away from me.

731
01:07:48,854 --> 01:07:51,307
- But at least listen to me...
- Never, never...

732
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:55,171
I will put an iron rod
from one ear to another,

733
01:07:55,212 --> 01:07:56,803
but I shall not listen to you ever.

734
01:07:56,883 --> 01:08:01,581
You have the audacity to turn
an artiste into a hired husband?

735
01:08:01,664 --> 01:08:06,391
This is enough to drown myself
in a fistful of water, mother...

736
01:08:07,656 --> 01:08:09,926
Listen...

737
01:08:11,259 --> 01:08:12,072
Damn!

738
01:08:12,416 --> 01:08:16,266
He is really arrogant and I'm helpless.

739
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:20,799
Look I'm in a great difficulty.

740
01:08:22,046 --> 01:08:24,446
I had come to you with great faith.

741
01:08:24,803 --> 01:08:27,173
I have come to you with a request.

742
01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:29,350
Request then, what do you have to say?

743
01:08:30,510 --> 01:08:33,710
I am anxious to know your request.

744
01:08:34,279 --> 01:08:38,232
Look my grandfather will disinherit me...

745
01:08:39,647 --> 01:08:41,989
- I'm happy...
- He'll throw me out of the house...

746
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:45,270
- No problem...
- And he doesn't have a good health...

747
01:08:45,404 --> 01:08:49,023
And you want to cheat him.

748
01:08:49,653 --> 01:08:51,189
And that to by using an artiste...

749
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:55,750
This, hold this,
this calls for drowning once again...

750
01:08:57,326 --> 01:09:01,610
Listen, he is a peculiar.
What shall I do now?

751
01:09:02,369 --> 01:09:03,669
I cannot decide.

752
01:09:10,243 --> 01:09:14,371
What is happening? He was
in the pool a while ago, now he is out?

753
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:16,769
Is he a man or a ghost?

754
01:09:17,776 --> 01:09:20,001
Listen, wait...

755
01:09:20,447 --> 01:09:20,998
Tell me!

756
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:23,579
- What is it?
- What have you thought about me?

757
01:09:23,604 --> 01:09:26,004
I have thought that thinking of
this is an insult to thinking,

758
01:09:26,061 --> 01:09:29,260
- and so I have stopped thinking.
- Please, my grandfather is very ill.

759
01:09:29,285 --> 01:09:30,663
And you have the
illness of stubbornness.

760
01:09:30,704 --> 01:09:31,573
Boss...

761
01:09:32,616 --> 01:09:34,006
What are you saying brother?

762
01:09:34,094 --> 01:09:37,984
A beautiful girl is asking you so lovingly.
Agree to her wishes.

763
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:41,181
- Put away your anger now.
- Is that so?

764
01:09:42,373 --> 01:09:45,492
Okay, I'll go by your advice.
I'll ignore my temper,

765
01:09:45,897 --> 01:09:48,332
but you do know I have no time to waste.

766
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:50,230
Hey girl...

767
01:09:51,134 --> 01:09:52,103
Sorry! Sorry!

768
01:09:52,999 --> 01:09:56,826
I am willing to help you
out in your situation.

769
01:09:57,181 --> 01:09:58,618
Tell me how can I help you?

770
01:10:01,536 --> 01:10:04,540
Okay, enough, tell me in shorter way.

771
01:10:04,651 --> 01:10:08,251
You mean that right now I am in Paris,

772
01:10:22,763 --> 01:10:26,206
- Wait young man.
- What is the meaning of this?

773
01:10:26,509 --> 01:10:31,341
What kind of a youth are you?
You don't know what this sign means?

774
01:10:31,404 --> 01:10:32,107
Don't know!

775
01:10:32,356 --> 01:10:37,289
It means a boy should
give a girl a free ride?

776
01:10:39,812 --> 01:10:41,997
- Where would you like to go?
- Surajkunj.

777
01:10:43,683 --> 01:10:46,226
I'm going to dance at the fete.

778
01:10:55,825 --> 01:10:57,175
Okay here we are.

779
01:11:03,068 --> 01:11:04,756
Thank you, young man!

780
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:07,552
Come for the show, okay.

781
01:11:08,444 --> 01:11:10,596
This old age...

782
01:11:53,139 --> 01:11:56,691
"This day comes once in a young age."

783
01:11:56,810 --> 01:12:00,336
"It is like a fire in fuel."

784
01:12:00,377 --> 01:12:04,014
"My heat is lost."

785
01:12:04,055 --> 01:12:07,691
"Whatever will happen, I don't care."

786
01:12:11,169 --> 01:12:14,982
"This day comes in a young age."

787
01:12:15,015 --> 01:12:22,284
"It is like a fire in fuel.
My heat is lost."

788
01:12:22,325 --> 01:12:25,711
"This day comes once in a young age."

789
01:12:29,528 --> 01:12:33,458
"This day comes once in a young age."

790
01:12:58,582 --> 01:13:02,169
"When someone gets close to you..."

791
01:13:02,517 --> 01:13:05,441
"Will he etch your heart?"

792
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:09,067
"He will wake up your love."

793
01:13:09,789 --> 01:13:12,864
"He will steal your heart."

794
01:13:13,328 --> 01:13:16,753
"He comes in my dream..."

795
01:13:16,794 --> 01:13:20,487
"...and if he comes in my
dream, I'll be excited."

796
01:13:24,055 --> 01:13:31,424
"This day comes once in a young age."

797
01:14:15,108 --> 01:14:18,535
"The lovers are here."

798
01:14:18,897 --> 01:14:22,137
"They came with a big heart."

799
01:14:22,639 --> 01:14:25,465
"They have been intoxicated in your love."

800
01:14:26,191 --> 01:14:28,865
"You are in my dreams."

801
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:33,566
"Love is unpredictable."

802
01:14:33,591 --> 01:14:36,955
"You can't escape from love."

803
01:14:40,629 --> 01:14:44,215
"This day comes once in a young age."

804
01:14:44,316 --> 01:14:47,808
"It is like a fire in fuel.
My heat is lost."

805
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:51,637
"My heat is lost."

806
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:55,299
"Whatever will happen, I don't care."

807
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:09,315
Welcome, welcome my dear!

808
01:15:28,484 --> 01:15:30,225
Come, welcome my dear son.

809
01:15:30,503 --> 01:15:34,376
I bow to thee, respected grandfather!

810
01:15:36,849 --> 01:15:37,739
Rise my son, rise.

811
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:43,172
- You are welcome to my home.
- Thank you!

812
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:45,609
You have been blessed with a tall stature.

813
01:15:45,997 --> 01:15:48,337
If I jump, then also I won't
be able to reach your height!

814
01:15:48,654 --> 01:15:49,943
Did you have a good flight?

815
01:15:50,687 --> 01:15:56,865
A person who will one day be
burnt on the pyre, will burn,

816
01:15:57,429 --> 01:16:01,032
and will become one with the earth,
and will be spread within the breeze,

817
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:04,789
how can such a man be asked
to describe his journey?

818
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:09,601
- Oh! What great thoughts you have.
- Thank you, thank you.

819
01:16:09,677 --> 01:16:12,110
May you live as long as the earth exists.

820
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:16,266
And that an ordinary man as myself
should prosper in your warm shelter.

821
01:16:16,862 --> 01:16:18,913
Oh! What a philosophical person you are.

822
01:16:19,284 --> 01:16:21,537
My girl, you have found
a very good match indeed.

823
01:16:21,645 --> 01:16:23,789
It's true that I cannot understand
a word that he is saying,

824
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:26,657
but, he does sound very warm and pleasant.

825
01:16:27,689 --> 01:16:29,077
- Come let's sit.
- Yes!

826
01:16:31,008 --> 01:16:33,426
Oh what's this?
Why are you sitting on the floor?

827
01:16:33,483 --> 01:16:35,253
Come sit by my side.

828
01:16:35,278 --> 01:16:35,947
No, sir,

829
01:16:37,201 --> 01:16:41,506
I cannot sit by your side as
I am not comparable to your deeds.

830
01:16:42,545 --> 01:16:44,311
The one who is comparable with you is...

831
01:16:44,336 --> 01:16:45,441
...the one who can sit by your side.

832
01:16:45,591 --> 01:16:48,474
And the one who isn't your
equal cannot sit by your side.

833
01:16:48,943 --> 01:16:52,944
Son, I really don't follow
this equality of yours.

834
01:16:54,315 --> 01:16:57,453
It's best if you don't
understand, why isn't it true?

835
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,606
- Oh! Yes it is true.
- So come, sit by my side.

836
01:17:01,822 --> 01:17:02,445
But...

837
01:17:02,511 --> 01:17:04,588
He's right dear,
when the husband is on the floor...

838
01:17:04,613 --> 01:17:06,583
...the wife being above
him doesn't seem right.

839
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:09,790
He is your son-in-law.
Ask him to sit on the sofa.

840
01:17:09,815 --> 01:17:13,935
Oh yes, what am I doing! Son,
you are the son-in-law. Sit on the sofa.

841
01:17:14,317 --> 01:17:15,417
As you wish.

842
01:17:16,749 --> 01:17:17,892
You sit there itself, child.

843
01:17:18,456 --> 01:17:22,483
I thought that because
you have come from abroad,

844
01:17:22,695 --> 01:17:27,777
you must have turned into an Englishman,
but I'm glad it is not so.

845
01:17:29,216 --> 01:17:32,766
The lotus grows in a muck,
but does it change the lotus?

846
01:17:32,969 --> 01:17:33,635
Not at all!

847
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:38,020
Acharya Bhishm has said that,
man should live as a hair in butter,

848
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:42,734
a net in the sea and a shield in war.
Applause...

849
01:17:46,271 --> 01:17:49,801
What is the applause for?
This is a home not a stage.

850
01:17:50,141 --> 01:17:57,726
Grandfather, the great Shakespeare
said that the world is a stage,

851
01:17:58,238 --> 01:18:00,210
life is drama,

852
01:18:00,381 --> 01:18:03,170
and we all are actors.

853
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:06,304
Death is it's veil.

854
01:18:07,468 --> 01:18:08,990
- Did he really say that?
- Yes.

855
01:18:09,712 --> 01:18:11,617
Claps! Loud claps!

856
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:17,010
We'll get along well.

857
01:18:17,584 --> 01:18:19,406
As smoothly as ice-cream!

858
01:18:19,431 --> 01:18:23,529
But grandfather,
some people are out to melt our ice-cream!

859
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:24,810
Who? Who? Who?

860
01:18:26,831 --> 01:18:30,837
There are many kinds of
people in this world.

861
01:18:32,237 --> 01:18:34,946
People who melt this world away!

862
01:18:35,062 --> 01:18:37,908
People who make suffering
people suffer more.

863
01:18:37,933 --> 01:18:42,015
Who don't let others get
along and get hired people!

864
01:18:42,070 --> 01:18:43,785
- Hired people?
- Yes.

865
01:18:43,810 --> 01:18:44,980
Who is the hired person?

866
01:18:45,758 --> 01:18:47,108
What are you saying, son?

867
01:18:47,133 --> 01:18:48,795
You're the son-in-law of this family.

868
01:18:48,931 --> 01:18:51,732
- No one can harm you.
- Yes.

869
01:18:51,844 --> 01:18:55,216
Son, I want you to take
over my entire wealth...

870
01:18:55,241 --> 01:18:57,319
- ...and business and let me rest.
- Yes.

871
01:18:57,420 --> 01:18:58,311
But...

872
01:18:58,663 --> 01:19:00,171
...what's the hurry, grandfather?

873
01:19:00,762 --> 01:19:04,503
There is, dear. Who knows about this life?

874
01:19:04,529 --> 01:19:06,958
It's passing away. It can end anytime.

875
01:19:06,999 --> 01:19:08,468
It can't, grandfather.

876
01:19:08,765 --> 01:19:13,093
We'll give our life to you,
but never let you die.

877
01:19:13,604 --> 01:19:15,834
Bless you son, bless you.

878
01:19:15,875 --> 01:19:17,943
Sir, it's time for your medicine.

879
01:19:17,984 --> 01:19:21,054
- Who's she?
- She's our family lady doctor.

880
01:19:21,134 --> 01:19:22,493
Oh, got it!

881
01:19:22,518 --> 01:19:24,572
The two of us, just two kids.

882
01:19:24,628 --> 01:19:27,273
Stay away from the wife,
even if it's difficult!

883
01:19:28,050 --> 01:19:29,725
- Clap!
- No, no, no.

884
01:19:29,986 --> 01:19:32,151
One shouldn't clap too much
during rehearsals, grandfather.

885
01:19:32,192 --> 01:19:34,852
Let the show get completed,
then there'll be applause!

886
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:36,707
What rehearsal? What show?

887
01:19:36,732 --> 01:19:40,039
- Mr. Rai, I think we've spoken a lot.
You should rest now. - Yes.

888
01:19:40,277 --> 01:19:43,523
Dear, take care of son-in-law.
Let him rest.

889
01:19:43,605 --> 01:19:45,125
- Come.
- I'll leave now.

890
01:19:45,166 --> 01:19:46,485
- Yes.
- Come.

891
01:19:46,526 --> 01:19:48,647
You rest and I'll rest too.

892
01:19:49,327 --> 01:19:51,623
I've done it so easily!

893
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:54,686
- So how was the first scene of my drama?
- Bad!

894
01:19:54,766 --> 01:19:58,015
- If it's bad, I'll get thrashed.
- Your style was so theatrical!

895
01:19:58,166 --> 01:19:59,401
As if you were doing a play!

896
01:19:59,766 --> 01:20:03,105
- Can't you act naturally?
- Naturally?

897
01:20:03,595 --> 01:20:06,484
Beautiful! Come to the room,
I'll show you right now!

898
01:20:06,727 --> 01:20:10,929
Lift the veil and show me the charm!
You're so sweet!

899
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:13,286
Mother!

900
01:20:14,564 --> 01:20:17,389
Shankar dear. You asked
for juice and are sitting here!

901
01:20:17,485 --> 01:20:18,284
Yes, I'm sorry mother.

902
01:20:19,515 --> 01:20:20,751
What're you looking at son?

903
01:20:20,932 --> 01:20:23,272
Some old royal jewels have come for sale.

904
01:20:23,703 --> 01:20:25,690
I've to arrange for their security.

905
01:21:16,684 --> 01:21:18,631

bid at the auction is 50 lakhs.

907
01:21:28,795 --> 01:21:30,718
- Get the money deposited today.

908
01:21:33,468 --> 01:21:35,703
We should get this necklace at any cost.

909
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:42,990
I want to gift this necklace
to Manju on her next birthday.

910
01:21:45,692 --> 01:21:46,842
- Simon!
- Yes?

911
01:21:47,438 --> 01:21:50,074

Put tow more officers there

919
01:23:47,104 --> 01:23:48,674
Your lying...

921
01:24:09,713 --> 01:24:10,572
Someone...

922
01:24:10,648 --> 01:24:12,360
He's got stuck? Call someone.

923
01:24:13,669 --> 01:24:15,299
Come here.

924
01:24:17,814 --> 01:24:18,279
Pull him.

925
01:24:25,713 --> 01:24:34,115
- Let me get the ambulance.
- Don't leave me.

926
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:23,229
Over there. Come.

927
01:25:46,595 --> 01:25:49,235
It's time for the flight.
Simon hasn't come yet, see.

928
01:25:49,504 --> 01:25:51,160
- Look, we need to finish his game.
- Shut up.

929
01:25:51,309 --> 01:25:54,949
- Vikram...
- What happened?

930
01:25:56,127 --> 01:25:57,983
- Give me the necklace.
- I don't have it.

931
01:25:58,270 --> 01:25:59,326
What do you mean?

932
01:25:59,351 --> 01:26:03,067
- But listen to me, they were chasing me.
- Who was chasing you?

933
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,332
- The police.
- Then?

934
01:26:04,793 --> 01:26:07,331
Then I went inside
there and put it inside that.

935
01:26:07,356 --> 01:26:09,409
Where did you go?
What did you put inside what?

936
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:12,231
There was a art gallery there.

937
01:26:12,312 --> 01:26:14,155
I put the necklace
inside the Shiva statue.

938
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:16,701
Are you mad?
I have already taken the money for it.

939
01:26:17,126 --> 01:26:19,123
I will give it to you tomorrow, pal.

940
01:26:20,949 --> 01:26:21,931
- Do one thing.
- Yes.

941
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:23,556
- I'll go to Kathmandu now.
- Yes.

942
01:26:23,772 --> 01:26:25,292
- I'll go there and convince Tom.
- Okay.

943
01:26:25,324 --> 01:26:27,309
- You come with that necklace
to Kathmandu tomorrow.

944
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:29,057
- Sure.
- If you don't...

945
01:26:30,116 --> 01:26:35,298
Shankar, the world will know
that you have been suspended.

946
01:26:35,836 --> 01:26:40,358
But that will not be the case.
This is between you and me.

947
01:26:41,292 --> 01:26:43,412
Now you can work in peace
and find the culprits.

948
01:26:44,015 --> 01:26:44,481
Yes sir.

949
01:26:45,059 --> 01:26:49,727
Shankar the honour of the police
department lies in your hands now.

950
01:26:50,695 --> 01:26:52,543
Don't worry, sir, I know what to do.

951
01:26:53,207 --> 01:26:54,093
One more point.

952
01:26:54,863 --> 01:27:00,735
The deposits made for the necklace,
also has one person from Nepal.

953
01:27:01,322 --> 01:27:01,999
Understand?

954
01:27:03,527 --> 01:27:04,127
Yes sir.

955
01:27:05,551 --> 01:27:07,220
- Best of luck.
- Thank you sir.

956
01:27:16,596 --> 01:27:20,181
Listen. I have especially
bought this statue for uncle.

957
01:27:20,803 --> 01:27:22,100
Take it carefully.

958
01:27:24,155 --> 01:27:26,748
Bless you my child.
May the good Lord protect you.

959
01:27:26,773 --> 01:27:28,123
Take care of yourself.

960
01:27:28,257 --> 01:27:31,274
Don't worry aunty, my uncle is great.

961
01:27:31,645 --> 01:27:33,519
They will get along so well...

962
01:27:33,544 --> 01:27:35,373
...like they have known
each other for years.

963
01:27:35,438 --> 01:27:38,358
He will remove the cob webs from his head.

964
01:27:38,768 --> 01:27:42,072
Listen, give this letter
to my uncle, please?

965
01:27:42,454 --> 01:27:43,962
He'll be very happy to see you!

966
01:27:44,466 --> 01:27:45,868
- Okay mother, I'll get going.
- Okay, son.

967
01:27:45,923 --> 01:27:46,579
Excuse me...

968
01:27:47,337 --> 01:27:48,758
Uncle is in abroad right now...

969
01:27:48,783 --> 01:27:52,298
...but by the time you reach there,
he'll reach Kathmandu.

970
01:27:52,353 --> 01:27:54,153
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

971
01:27:55,601 --> 01:27:59,347
Please smile sometimes at least.

972
01:28:00,111 --> 01:28:01,519
Laugh, my friend.

973
01:28:03,733 --> 01:28:05,516
No, not so much. Your jaw will tear.

974
01:28:05,606 --> 01:28:06,308
A little less.

975
01:28:07,776 --> 01:28:08,641
Is this okay?

976
01:28:09,398 --> 01:28:10,822
Yes, it's okay now.

977
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:14,500
Listen!

978
01:28:16,547 --> 01:28:17,262

- Yes, speaking!

981
01:28:30,542 --> 01:28:34,842
There was a Shiva statue in your art
gallery which I want to purchase.

982
01:28:35,408 --> 01:28:37,358
I'm sorry, but that statue has been sold.

983
01:28:38,265 --> 01:28:38,876
Sold?

984
01:28:39,255 --> 01:28:41,329
Please, don't do that.

985
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:42,472
She's really sold.

986
01:28:42,733 --> 01:28:44,391
Who took her away?

987
01:28:44,684 --> 01:28:48,568
My son is taking it to
Kathmandu to Rana Ranveer Singh.

988
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:34,646
Excuse me.

992
01:30:26,231 --> 01:30:26,934

994
01:30:49,208 --> 01:30:51,533
Mr. Rana has sent the car for you.
Please come.

995
01:31:57,177 --> 01:31:58,044
Welcome!

996
01:31:59,614 --> 01:32:00,293
Welcome!

997
01:32:03,922 --> 01:32:06,360
'Oh, he looks
exactly like Amit...'

998
01:32:07,119 --> 01:32:08,023
Are you Mr. Rana?

999
01:32:09,556 --> 01:32:11,531
Yes, I am Rana.

1000
01:32:12,387 --> 01:32:13,445
My name is Shankar.

1001
01:32:14,425 --> 01:32:17,053
Manju has sent a letter for you.

1002
01:32:18,396 --> 01:32:19,208
Khanna!

1003
01:32:36,936 --> 01:32:38,086
Okay, okay...

1004
01:32:40,542 --> 01:32:41,608
Where is the parcel?

1005
01:32:41,986 --> 01:32:44,226
This is it...

1006
01:32:46,698 --> 01:32:48,960
I have been waiting for
this parcel since yesterday.

1007
01:32:49,998 --> 01:32:52,498
Yes, but I was to come only today...

1008
01:32:53,536 --> 01:32:56,096
Sir, this is only a dinner set...

1009
01:33:13,712 --> 01:33:16,603
Sultan! Sultan!

1010
01:33:36,151 --> 01:33:37,439
Where is the real parcel?

1011
01:33:38,466 --> 01:33:39,340
Real parcel?

1012
01:33:40,348 --> 01:33:41,725
I don't understand...

1013
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:45,400
Hey inspector.
Don't act too smart with me.

1014
01:33:45,809 --> 01:33:48,569
Tell me. Where is that Shiva statue?

1015
01:33:49,661 --> 01:33:51,191
You seem to know a lot about me.

1016
01:33:51,330 --> 01:33:54,844
Don't talk too much.
Tell me where the Shiva statue is.

1017
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:59,285
What's in that statue that your
blood pressure is rising so rapidly?

1018
01:33:59,387 --> 01:34:05,239
I am asking you for the last time.
Where is the Shiva statue?

1019
01:34:05,978 --> 01:34:07,512
I will count up to three.

1020
01:34:08,927 --> 01:34:12,039
Answer me else I will blast your brains.

1021
01:34:13,318 --> 01:34:13,904
One.

1022
01:34:15,669 --> 01:34:16,333
Two.

1023
01:34:17,583 --> 01:34:18,043
Three.

1024
01:37:41,068 --> 01:37:43,393
What is this?

1025
01:37:46,255 --> 01:37:47,468
This is the Shiva statue...

1026
01:37:47,831 --> 01:37:50,619
How did this come here?
I had brought a dinner set...

1027
01:37:51,842 --> 01:37:55,054
Sir, this box has the Indian Airlines tag.

1028
01:37:55,458 --> 01:37:56,560
But you came from Japan.

1029
01:37:59,951 --> 01:38:02,231
Dad, this is the Nepal Airlines tag.

1030
01:38:03,876 --> 01:38:07,480
Nepal Airline?
But Shankar came from Delhi...

1031
01:38:08,839 --> 01:38:13,429
Prem, the parcels have been exchanged.

1032
01:38:13,946 --> 01:38:15,577
Else how would this parcel go to Shankar?

1033
01:38:17,898 --> 01:38:19,068
- Anees!
- Yes sir.

1034
01:38:19,950 --> 01:38:21,900
- You go to the airport and find out.
- Yes sir.

1035
01:38:22,058 --> 01:38:22,449
Come!

1036
01:38:23,096 --> 01:38:25,246
Sir, look at this picture?

1037
01:38:29,147 --> 01:38:29,905
Janki...

1038
01:38:31,508 --> 01:38:32,408
Amit's wife...

1039
01:38:34,259 --> 01:38:34,775
'Yes...'

1040
01:38:36,220 --> 01:38:37,520
'Good evening...'

1041
01:38:42,172 --> 01:38:43,272
That means.

1042
01:38:44,591 --> 01:38:46,191
Shankar is Amit's son.

1043
01:38:49,955 --> 01:38:52,825
And he has come as a
guest to Mr. Rana's house.

1044
01:38:53,512 --> 01:38:54,105
Simon.

1045
01:38:55,702 --> 01:38:58,298
Search every corner of Rana's house.

1046
01:41:11,698 --> 01:41:12,885
- Kailash!
- Yes sir!

1047
01:41:13,424 --> 01:41:17,874
- What was that scream?
- I too came after hearing it.

1048
01:41:18,062 --> 01:41:19,758
Lord Shiva's statue had fallen here.

1049
01:44:10,032 --> 01:44:11,055
Oh wow...

1050
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:18,094
What are you doing Queen Rita?
Put off the lights at least.

1051
01:44:19,156 --> 01:44:21,813
- You!
- Give me a kiss.

1052
01:44:22,102 --> 01:44:24,532
You idiot, what are you doing here?

1053
01:44:25,333 --> 01:44:29,757
These hands are not for hitting,
they are for loving.

1054
01:44:29,782 --> 01:44:30,381
Shut up.

1055
01:44:30,587 --> 01:44:31,760
- He is right.
- You?

1056
01:44:32,061 --> 01:44:33,289
What are you doing here?

1057
01:44:33,865 --> 01:44:42,007
When a girl wears a sari, with a flower
necklace, she belongs to her man,

1058
01:44:42,157 --> 01:44:45,586
then she follows her man.

1059
01:44:45,818 --> 01:44:47,282
That's why I say...

1060
01:44:47,385 --> 01:44:52,805
"Half of the work is
done, do the remaining."

1061
01:44:55,559 --> 01:45:00,808
"Half of the work is
done, do the remaining."

1062
01:45:01,396 --> 01:45:06,358
"Let's turn this night
into a nuptial night."

1063
01:45:06,832 --> 01:45:09,752
"Put the vermilion of my name."

1064
01:45:12,260 --> 01:45:17,420
"Put the vermilion of my name."

1065
01:45:17,625 --> 01:45:22,485
"Half of the work is
done, do the remaining."

1066
01:45:23,014 --> 01:45:27,864
"Let's turn this night
into a nuptial night."

1067
01:45:28,249 --> 01:45:30,719
Wow, Guru, wow, you got her hooked...

1068
01:45:30,822 --> 01:45:32,942
Shut up. Get out of here.

1069
01:45:50,176 --> 01:45:55,437
"If I get a beauty like you, I'll die."

1070
01:45:55,778 --> 01:46:01,010
"And if I die, what will I say to God."

1071
01:46:01,179 --> 01:46:06,287
"If I get a beauty like you, I'll die."

1072
01:46:06,541 --> 01:46:11,197
"And if I die, what will I say to God."

1073
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:13,356
"I don't care, if you get angry."

1074
01:46:13,397 --> 01:46:14,352
"Never mind."

1075
01:46:14,392 --> 01:46:15,941
"I don't care, if you shout."

1076
01:46:16,221 --> 01:46:19,525
"- It is fine. - I don't care,
if you get angry, if you shout."

1077
01:46:19,605 --> 01:46:22,109
"I don't care."

1078
01:46:22,372 --> 01:46:28,153
"Come into my arms."

1079
01:46:28,194 --> 01:46:33,533
"Come into my arms, and stay relaxed."

1080
01:46:33,637 --> 01:46:38,614
"Half of the work is
done, do the remaining."

1081
01:46:38,966 --> 01:46:44,863
"Let's turn this night
into a nuptial night."

1082
01:47:16,784 --> 01:47:22,133
"You hate love,
come I'll teach you to make love."

1083
01:47:22,316 --> 01:47:27,636
"The beauty has no meaning without love."

1084
01:47:27,748 --> 01:47:32,746
"You hate love,
come I'll teach you to make love."

1085
01:47:33,172 --> 01:47:37,562
"The beauty has no meaning without love."

1086
01:47:38,232 --> 01:47:40,321
"If the heart..."

1087
01:47:40,881 --> 01:47:43,233
"...is lost in love,"

1088
01:47:43,583 --> 01:47:46,135
"if the heart lost in love..."

1089
01:47:46,277 --> 01:47:48,957
"...everyone gets the meaning of love."

1090
01:47:49,422 --> 01:47:52,014
"Fall in love."

1091
01:47:52,172 --> 01:47:53,864
"Hail Ganges."

1092
01:47:54,819 --> 01:47:59,615
"Fall in love and attain your goal."

1093
01:48:00,284 --> 01:48:05,204
"Half of the work is
done, do the remaining."

1094
01:48:05,662 --> 01:48:08,432
"Let's turn this night in..."

1095
01:48:19,211 --> 01:48:22,897
"Let's get ready for the nuptial night."

1096
01:48:26,728 --> 01:48:28,892
You're taking advantage
of my helplessness.

1097
01:48:29,313 --> 01:48:31,063
You're bent on humiliating me.

1098
01:48:31,437 --> 01:48:33,712
I'll stop this farce today.

1099
01:48:34,454 --> 01:48:37,938
Maybe you've forgotten that
you're just a hired husband.

1100
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:40,859
I cancel this agreement.

1101
01:48:41,094 --> 01:48:44,593
Take your money and get out from here.

1102
01:48:44,649 --> 01:48:46,843
Get out. I said, get out.

1103
01:48:46,924 --> 01:48:51,362
Hey, hey, ma'am.
Lower your voice a little.

1104
01:48:52,062 --> 01:48:53,440
And control that tongue of yours.

1105
01:48:54,563 --> 01:48:58,227
I'm an actor, but I have dignity too.

1106
01:48:58,766 --> 01:49:02,727
Dialogues like get out and go away,
I've used them many a times.

1107
01:49:03,446 --> 01:49:07,266
If someone uses them with me
in real life, I beat them a lot.

1108
01:49:07,468 --> 01:49:10,142
I break their jaw and
then they can't even talk!

1109
01:49:11,406 --> 01:49:16,383
I respect you. So take this.
Your Rs.10,000.

1110
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:18,298
A gift from an artist!

1111
01:49:19,789 --> 01:49:23,227
Hey, uncle, what are you doing here? Come!

1112
01:49:24,234 --> 01:49:27,593
You're used to living with
people who are good-hearted.

1113
01:49:28,407 --> 01:49:32,258
These are rich and heartless people. Yes.

1114
01:49:41,845 --> 01:49:42,793
Who are you?

1115
01:49:43,314 --> 01:49:48,329
Sir, I'm Shankar and I'm coming
straight to you from Delhi.

1116
01:49:48,470 --> 01:49:49,759
- From Delhi?
- Yes.

1117
01:49:52,267 --> 01:49:54,736
Tell me, what can I do for you?

1118
01:49:55,852 --> 01:49:57,701
Oh, I'm so tired!

1119
01:49:59,446 --> 01:50:02,212
She has sent a letter in your name.
Manju...

1120
01:50:03,204 --> 01:50:04,025
- Manju!
- Yes!

1121
01:50:11,551 --> 01:50:12,761
She has praised you.

1122
01:50:12,786 --> 01:50:16,386
She must have felt sorry for
me and said that. Else I...

1123
01:50:17,355 --> 01:50:19,532
Sir, your dinner set.

1124
01:50:21,785 --> 01:50:25,445
- It's for me?
- Yes. That must have reached you already?

1125
01:50:26,251 --> 01:50:27,681
- Who?
- No!

1126
01:50:30,490 --> 01:50:34,829
That, the Shiva statue. Shiva, Shiva...

1127
01:50:35,181 --> 01:50:37,853
Lord Shiva! Hail Lord Pashupatinath!

1128
01:50:38,008 --> 01:50:39,872
Lord you have put me into trouble.

1129
01:50:40,183 --> 01:50:42,475
I am crazy about him.

1130
01:50:42,799 --> 01:50:45,650
If it were not for him, I would be ruined.

1131
01:50:46,425 --> 01:50:47,078
Ruin?

1132
01:50:47,878 --> 01:50:53,848
I mean, yes,
it is unlucky to lose an idol.

1133
01:50:53,978 --> 01:50:57,219
It's a good thing it reached
the right place, sir.

1134
01:50:58,130 --> 01:51:00,028
But how did the luggage get exchanged?

1135
01:51:00,068 --> 01:51:00,917
In the air...

1136
01:51:01,772 --> 01:51:04,302
- In the air?
- I mean at the airport.

1137
01:51:04,462 --> 01:51:07,547
This airport staff
indulges in work blindly.

1138
01:51:07,641 --> 01:51:11,423
They send goods meant for
one place to another, sir.

1139
01:51:12,501 --> 01:51:13,681
- Kailash.
- Yes sir?

1140
01:51:14,595 --> 01:51:16,995
- Look, this Mr. Shankar is our guest.
- Greetings.

1141
01:51:17,020 --> 01:51:18,596
- Get the guest room opened for him.
- Yes.

1142
01:51:18,731 --> 01:51:20,707
Please go with him. You will dine with me.

1143
01:51:20,778 --> 01:51:26,082
- I will eat pure vegetarian food, sir?
- Okay. Good day.

1144
01:51:27,315 --> 01:51:32,430
Sir, I have brought some
paintings for you too, sir.

1145
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:37,471
Beautiful paintings.
Manju has sent these too.

1146
01:51:39,603 --> 01:51:40,452
Very beautiful.

1147
01:51:41,092 --> 01:51:41,965
There are more...

1148
01:51:43,032 --> 01:51:43,837
Take this!

1149
01:52:04,527 --> 01:52:09,501
This picture with you...

1150
01:52:10,209 --> 01:52:11,319
This is my mothers.

1151
01:52:14,045 --> 01:52:17,536
- Mother?
- Yes sir, my mother.

1152
01:52:18,228 --> 01:52:21,121
Is she, is she alive?

1153
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:23,892
Of course sir she's alive, hopefully...

1154
01:52:24,018 --> 01:52:25,431
...she could live my share as well.

1155
01:52:28,537 --> 01:52:33,133
Sir, sir, why are you
asking me these questions?

1156
01:52:35,340 --> 01:52:38,538
Don't bother, you may leave.

1157
01:52:42,155 --> 01:52:47,063
'Janki, my Janki is alive!'

1158
01:52:50,351 --> 01:52:52,991
'I'm coming to you Janki.'

1159
01:53:00,165 --> 01:53:02,985
Janki.

1160
01:53:04,185 --> 01:53:06,408
- Who is it?
- It's me Janki.

1161
01:53:12,555 --> 01:53:13,555
You...

1162
01:53:13,980 --> 01:53:14,871
Janki!

1163
01:53:16,324 --> 01:53:17,449
You!

1164
01:53:22,168 --> 01:53:23,168
Janki!

1165
01:53:34,275 --> 01:53:36,868
Come on Janki,
I've come to fetch you, let's go.

1166
01:53:36,932 --> 01:53:37,502
Halt.

1167
01:53:40,298 --> 01:53:42,376
Inspector you!

1168
01:53:42,941 --> 01:53:43,662
Yes, me...

1169
01:53:45,917 --> 01:53:47,793
I have a warrant for your arrest,
here you may read it.

1170
01:53:50,689 --> 01:53:54,799
But inspector, I have just met
my wife after a long spate.

1171
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:59,151
First you have to deal with the law.

1172
01:54:00,204 --> 01:54:02,806
No inspector, today nobody will stop me!

1173
01:54:04,485 --> 01:54:06,118
- Wait!
- No!

1174
01:54:06,922 --> 01:54:09,239
- Come on Janki.
- Stop or I will shoot.

1175
01:54:09,325 --> 01:54:11,563
No...

1176
01:54:27,356 --> 01:54:32,559
Sir, sir, someone
has come to meet you.

1177
01:55:05,202 --> 01:55:06,189
Yes inspector.

1178
01:55:07,519 --> 01:55:11,304
People here seem very quick.

1179
01:55:12,322 --> 01:55:14,058
They recognize people from their smell.

1180
01:55:15,568 --> 01:55:16,956
Now that you have recognised me...

1181
01:55:16,981 --> 01:55:18,399
...I may as well tell you the rest.

1182
01:55:19,096 --> 01:55:23,946
I am Inspector Shankar and I have
come here to investigate something.

1183
01:55:24,533 --> 01:55:31,350
Investigate what?

1184
01:55:33,045 --> 01:55:38,217
Some days ago, a necklace worth
crores was stolen from India.

1185
01:55:39,299 --> 01:55:39,742
So?

1186
01:55:40,871 --> 01:55:44,983
You too had deposited money to bid for it.

1187
01:55:47,126 --> 01:55:48,520
Yes, I had.

1188
01:55:49,641 --> 01:55:50,142
So?

1189
01:55:52,254 --> 01:55:55,798
Can you tell me where
the necklace is right now?

1190
01:55:59,181 --> 01:56:02,791
What are you trying to say?
That I have a hand in the robbery?

1191
01:56:03,921 --> 01:56:07,681
The rich use their tongue not their hands.

1192
01:56:09,344 --> 01:56:12,886
The small fly steal on their command.

1193
01:56:13,368 --> 01:56:16,917
So you mean to say that I am
some underground operation chief?

1194
01:56:17,521 --> 01:56:20,635
I am not saying this.
You are accusing yourself.

1195
01:56:20,855 --> 01:56:24,098
I have no time to listen to
your loose talk. You may go.

1196
01:56:24,896 --> 01:56:25,510
Please.

1197
01:56:27,082 --> 01:56:27,709
Very well.

1198
01:56:49,677 --> 01:56:50,668
Mr. Rana...

1199
01:56:52,743 --> 01:56:54,938
...this statue here?

1200
01:56:55,525 --> 01:56:56,019
Why?

1201
01:56:58,901 --> 01:57:00,689
What is so special about this statue?

1202
01:57:02,402 --> 01:57:03,562
Special...

1203
01:57:06,503 --> 01:57:10,704
...a lot of people are
in want of this statue.

1204
01:57:11,773 --> 01:57:13,094
Actually we worship
the Gods in these statues.

1205
01:57:13,094 --> 01:57:19,790
But these days, smuggled goods
are to be found inside such...

1206
01:57:20,585 --> 01:57:22,628
Mind you tongue, inspector.

1207
01:57:23,799 --> 01:57:24,861
I'm sorry!

1208
01:57:25,549 --> 01:57:28,130
By the way,
how long have you been in Nepal?

1209
01:57:29,143 --> 01:57:29,949
25 years.

1210
01:57:30,909 --> 01:57:31,658
25 years?

1211
01:57:34,389 --> 01:57:37,814
That means you have come from
some other country into this one.

1212
01:57:38,268 --> 01:57:42,626
The fact that you speak such good Hindi,
it is obvious you belong to India.

1213
01:57:43,354 --> 01:57:47,501
Yes, I had come from India.
Satisfied? Now please leave.

1214
01:57:48,064 --> 01:57:48,712
But...

1215
01:57:50,282 --> 01:57:51,892
I still have some more questions for you.

1216
01:57:52,006 --> 01:57:53,498
But I am done with my answers.

1217
01:57:53,875 --> 01:57:55,904
Yes but I still have questions.

1218
01:57:57,155 --> 01:58:01,307
Inspector, you have no law that says,

1219
01:58:01,332 --> 01:58:05,444
that you can force me to
answer your questions.

1220
01:58:06,168 --> 01:58:09,761
You know a lot about the law.

1221
01:58:10,793 --> 01:58:12,213
Were you a lawyer before?

1222
01:58:12,728 --> 01:58:13,595
Inspector!

1223
01:58:13,761 --> 01:58:20,126
I remember. 25 years ago,
there was a good lawyer in Bombay,

1224
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:23,080
who committed a murder and ran away.

1225
01:58:23,417 --> 01:58:24,724
And he hasn't been found yet.

1226
01:58:25,135 --> 01:58:25,957
Look inspector.

1227
01:58:25,982 --> 01:58:29,212
Allow me to talk, Mr. Rana.

1228
01:58:30,892 --> 01:58:35,860
As per the descriptions,
you match him very well.

1229
01:58:37,066 --> 01:58:40,962
He too was tall like you.

1230
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:46,282
You too are tall like me.
So can you not be the murderer?

1231
01:58:51,498 --> 01:58:54,734
You have stopped practicing,
but you still think like a lawyer.

1232
01:58:57,073 --> 01:58:58,252
Look Mr. Advocate...

1233
01:58:59,503 --> 01:59:01,086
I mean Mr. Rana...

1234
01:59:02,018 --> 01:59:04,820
This is 25 years old.

1235
01:59:05,451 --> 01:59:07,608
And I was not born at that time.

1236
01:59:08,131 --> 01:59:09,331
But you were.

1237
01:59:10,337 --> 01:59:17,454
And you are the same age
as that man 25 years ago.

1238
01:59:17,549 --> 01:59:19,236
Shut up and get lost!

1239
01:59:20,963 --> 01:59:21,580
Okay sir!

1240
01:59:22,737 --> 01:59:25,486
- I will see you another time.
- That time will never come.

1241
01:59:27,302 --> 01:59:31,132
Whether that time comes or not,
Inspector Shankar will certainly come.

1242
01:59:31,317 --> 01:59:32,434
Get out!

1243
01:59:46,422 --> 01:59:49,718
Thank you so much, God.

1244
01:59:52,525 --> 01:59:55,866
By creating men...

1245
01:59:57,034 --> 01:59:59,214
...you've done the world a great favour.

1246
01:59:59,459 --> 02:00:03,443
Actually, a girl like you
should never get married.

1247
02:00:03,944 --> 02:00:09,394
Aunty! But you used to say that a
woman is incomplete without a man.

1248
02:00:09,710 --> 02:00:11,606
And that I need to get married.

1249
02:00:12,869 --> 02:00:15,770
You need to be married?

1250
02:00:15,970 --> 02:00:16,649
Yes.

1251
02:00:17,127 --> 02:00:18,352
Need to?

1252
02:00:20,456 --> 02:00:23,634
Then I will go and tell
your grandfather right away.

1253
02:00:23,659 --> 02:00:24,837
Oh no, no...

1254
02:00:25,013 --> 02:00:26,825
Grandfather will print
it in the papers again.

1255
02:00:26,850 --> 02:00:29,508
And once again dozens of suitors
will come and stand in a queue.

1256
02:00:29,773 --> 02:00:33,693
- And then I...
- Then who will you get married to?

1257
02:00:34,154 --> 02:00:38,810
- That, that, Guru...
- But he is tall...

1258
02:00:39,838 --> 02:00:42,712
- Will do.
- Like a light pole...

1259
02:00:43,236 --> 02:00:45,696
- Will do.
- A palm tree...

1260
02:00:45,851 --> 02:00:48,954
- Will do.
- He is so arrogant.

1261
02:00:49,116 --> 02:00:53,376
Will do, will do, you see I love him...

1262
02:00:56,430 --> 02:00:57,235
Love him!

1263
02:01:05,151 --> 02:01:09,487
My ex-father-in-law,
give your ex-son-in-law blessings...

1264
02:01:09,512 --> 02:01:12,347
...for he has just come
from being freshly married.

1265
02:01:12,495 --> 02:01:16,015
Very well done, my son. Bless you.
May you be married forever.

1266
02:01:16,962 --> 02:01:17,556
What...

1267
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:23,943
Where?

1268
02:01:23,968 --> 02:01:27,882
How dare you. You got married
again while I'm still around?

1269
02:01:27,907 --> 02:01:30,237
I will empty all these bullets
into this witches body.

1270
02:01:30,262 --> 02:01:32,283
Wait child. I will take care of him.

1271
02:01:33,405 --> 02:01:35,327
What did you say? You got married?

1272
02:01:35,439 --> 02:01:36,751
How can you get married again,

1273
02:01:36,776 --> 02:01:38,997
when you are already
married to my granddaughter?

1274
02:01:41,615 --> 02:01:44,585
What granddaughter? What marriage?

1275
02:01:44,858 --> 02:01:47,378
Your granddaughter can never be married.

1276
02:01:47,552 --> 02:01:51,688
She can cheat you but she cannot marry.
Applause!

1277
02:01:51,767 --> 02:01:52,800
Stop it!

1278
02:01:52,825 --> 02:01:53,681
And listen...

1279
02:01:53,706 --> 02:01:54,290
Guru!

1280
02:01:56,019 --> 02:01:57,719
That was not a marriage, it was a drama.

1281
02:01:57,861 --> 02:01:59,915
- A drama?
- Yes a drama.

1282
02:02:00,025 --> 02:02:02,395
A drama which was filled with,

1283
02:02:02,420 --> 02:02:06,630
deceit, trashy, tricky,
sham, cheating, corruption.

1284
02:02:07,556 --> 02:02:11,064
I was given money and brought here.
I was made into a hired husband...

1285
02:02:11,064 --> 02:02:12,394
...and I was introduced to you.

1286
02:02:12,481 --> 02:02:13,946
- Oh my God!
- Shut up!

1287
02:02:13,971 --> 02:02:16,175
There is still more to say, but now...

1288
02:02:17,451 --> 02:02:20,452
But now I cannot be a
hired husband anymore.

1289
02:02:20,923 --> 02:02:26,507
I have become this girl's husband.

1290
02:02:27,316 --> 02:02:29,120
- Tribhovan!
- Das!

1291
02:02:29,386 --> 02:02:31,152
- Triloki nath!
- Verma!

1292
02:02:31,229 --> 02:02:33,003
- Maithili Sharan!
- Gupt!

1293
02:02:33,029 --> 02:02:34,763
- Sumitranandan!
- Pant!

1294
02:02:34,788 --> 02:02:36,573
- Lajja Shankar!
- Jha!

1295
02:02:36,737 --> 02:02:40,287
No, no. You cannot do such a thing.

1296
02:02:40,326 --> 02:02:43,745
Cannot do this?
What are you talking about, madam?

1297
02:02:44,049 --> 02:02:46,522
I have already done it.
Become husband and wife...

1298
02:02:46,769 --> 02:02:48,929
I just came to tell you,
take your blessings...

1299
02:02:48,954 --> 02:02:51,831
- No you are my husband...
- Husband?

1300
02:02:53,142 --> 02:02:56,762
Grandfather, did you ever see us together?

1301
02:02:56,805 --> 02:03:00,714
Did you ever see us holding hands?
Forget holding hands...

1302
02:03:01,108 --> 02:03:04,228
Did you ever see us smile
and speak to each other?

1303
02:03:04,480 --> 02:03:07,394
- Stop it!
- Please carry on!

1304
02:03:07,446 --> 02:03:08,648
- Guru!
- Yes!

1305
02:03:08,821 --> 02:03:10,851
- Tell me the truth. What is it?
- I'll tell you grandfather.

1306
02:03:11,034 --> 02:03:15,001
This marriage was a
drama to keep you happy.

1307
02:03:15,062 --> 02:03:17,030
If I spend a few more days with this girl,

1308
02:03:17,192 --> 02:03:18,909
she would've gotten a child on hire,

1309
02:03:18,933 --> 02:03:21,581
- and said the baby is ours.
- All this is nonsense.

1310
02:03:21,606 --> 02:03:22,903
- Shut up...
- Nonsense!

1311
02:03:23,050 --> 02:03:24,590
I have understood everything.

1312
02:03:24,826 --> 02:03:26,932
You have cheated me.

1313
02:03:27,389 --> 02:03:29,147
I'm no longer capable
of facing the society.

1314
02:03:29,636 --> 02:03:34,416
You've ruined the respect of this family.

1315
02:03:34,534 --> 02:03:40,034
Death is better than this.
Hey Lord, I don't want to live anymore...

1316
02:03:40,059 --> 02:03:42,268
Take me into your arms.

1317
02:03:42,348 --> 02:03:43,962
- Mr. Rai!
- Sir!

1318
02:03:44,012 --> 02:03:45,964
- What happened?
- Sir!

1319
02:03:46,105 --> 02:03:47,277
- Mr. Rai!
- Grandfather!

1320
02:03:47,605 --> 02:03:49,128
Sir, sir!

1321
02:03:49,566 --> 02:03:51,074
I am very sorry!

1322
02:03:51,196 --> 02:03:55,228
No grandfather...

1323
02:04:02,550 --> 02:04:05,635
What have you done?
You have killed my grandfather.

1324
02:04:06,066 --> 02:04:07,708
Could you not wait a little longer?

1325
02:04:07,733 --> 02:04:09,393
Could you not keep your mouth shut?

1326
02:04:10,629 --> 02:04:13,324
I wanted to tell grandfather
everything myself.

1327
02:04:13,747 --> 02:04:17,815
That all this was a drama.
That I will get married and have a family.

1328
02:04:18,172 --> 02:04:19,808
You? Have a family?

1329
02:04:20,598 --> 02:04:24,674
Why? Am I not a woman?
Can I not love someone?

1330
02:04:24,981 --> 02:04:30,800
I'm sorry, but I have to say this.

1331
02:04:31,106 --> 02:04:32,256
From the look of your face,

1332
02:04:32,306 --> 02:04:34,714
it doesn't look like you are capable
of having a heart or loving someone.

1333
02:04:34,855 --> 02:04:39,213
Yes! Yes! I am a stone.
I have no such thing as a heart.

1334
02:04:39,618 --> 02:04:41,601
Until today,
everyone has been scared of me.

1335
02:04:41,626 --> 02:04:45,250
- No one has loved me.
- And when have you loved anyone?

1336
02:04:45,691 --> 02:04:48,213
Ask yourself. What did I tell her?

1337
02:04:50,275 --> 02:04:51,779
I love you.

1338
02:04:52,781 --> 02:04:55,981
And was going to tell grandfather...

1339
02:04:56,006 --> 02:04:59,242
This is what I wanted to hear! Applause!

1340
02:05:01,714 --> 02:05:05,307
Grandfather, you are alive!

1341
02:05:05,844 --> 02:05:10,235
If you can act, can we not?
What do you say?

1342
02:05:10,501 --> 02:05:11,745
- Yes Gurunath?
- Yes, grandfather.

1343
02:05:11,770 --> 02:05:14,807
I am your father's father.
I have brought you up from childhood.

1344
02:05:14,832 --> 02:05:16,338
I understand you very well.

1345
02:05:17,111 --> 02:05:19,337
Gurunath, I delivered
the dialogue well, right?

1346
02:05:19,378 --> 02:05:21,399
What, grandfather?
That, husband on hire...

1347
02:05:21,424 --> 02:05:22,962
...kids on hire, you forgot all that!

1348
02:05:23,212 --> 02:05:25,658
Oh, yes! Maybe I forgot,
but I got the work done!

1349
02:05:25,683 --> 02:05:28,175
Grandfather, there's one more
mystery left to be unraveled.

1350
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:31,711
Your grandfather never had
nor has any heart ailment!

1351
02:05:31,736 --> 02:05:35,126
- When you're not with him, he eats
to his heart's content! - Grandfather!

1352
02:05:35,167 --> 02:05:36,916
- You're happy now, right?
- Oh, yes.

1353
02:05:36,941 --> 02:05:38,878
Then come,
let's get you both married lavishly.

1354
02:05:39,540 --> 02:05:41,907
Grandfather but she?

1355
02:05:42,936 --> 02:05:43,754
She?

1356
02:05:45,142 --> 02:05:47,965
Tara, Tara my wife.

1357
02:05:48,087 --> 02:05:50,971
My lawful wife! Guru's hired wife!

1358
02:05:51,683 --> 02:05:53,887
- Who is this now?
- Hey, tell him about me.

1359
02:05:53,908 --> 02:05:54,690
Yes, sure.

1360
02:05:54,906 --> 02:05:57,839
Grandfather,
he is the director of my charade.

1361
02:05:58,169 --> 02:06:01,345
- Oh you, scoundrel!
- Grandfather.

1362
02:06:05,441 --> 02:06:06,002
Grandfather.

1363
02:07:08,679 --> 02:07:14,705
"Fire the bullet and take my life."

1364
02:07:15,666 --> 02:07:21,750
"Fire the bullet and take my life."

1365
02:07:22,221 --> 02:07:29,455
"After death,
I'll not stop following you."

1366
02:07:36,428 --> 02:07:42,815
"Fire the bullet and take my life."

1367
02:07:43,634 --> 02:07:50,420
"After death,
I'll not stop following you."

1368
02:07:57,403 --> 02:08:04,229
"Fire the bullet and take my life."

1369
02:08:35,826 --> 02:08:39,803
"You're angry on me."

1370
02:08:39,923 --> 02:08:43,419
"I don't know your role."

1371
02:08:43,452 --> 02:08:46,874
"Sometimes you say yes,
sometimes you say no."

1372
02:08:47,034 --> 02:08:50,170
"I love you, very much."

1373
02:08:50,752 --> 02:08:57,092
"You're angry on me.
I don't know your role."

1374
02:08:57,485 --> 02:09:03,697
"Sometimes you say yes, sometimes
you say no. I love you, very much."

1375
02:09:04,109 --> 02:09:11,162
"I know that you love me so much."

1376
02:09:18,516 --> 02:09:25,016
"Fire the bullet and take my life."

1377
02:10:01,030 --> 02:10:07,980
"I didn't even know,
that love is this sweet."

1378
02:10:08,241 --> 02:10:15,032
"When I came in your
arms, I didn't know..."

1379
02:10:15,279 --> 02:10:21,616
"I didn't even know,
that love is this sweet."

1380
02:10:22,267 --> 02:10:28,643
"When I came in your
arms, I didn't know..."

1381
02:10:29,001 --> 02:10:35,279
"No beauty is like you."

1382
02:10:43,197 --> 02:10:50,376
"Fire the bullet and take my life."

1383
02:11:18,531 --> 02:11:25,314
"We're incomplete without each other."

1384
02:11:25,786 --> 02:11:32,449
"To live on Earth,
it was must to meet each other."

1385
02:11:33,300 --> 02:11:39,643
"We're incomplete without each other."

1386
02:11:39,935 --> 02:11:46,790
"To live on Earth,
it was must to meet each other."

1387
02:11:46,925 --> 02:11:50,464
"I live in your heart,
and you live in my heart."

1388
02:11:50,505 --> 02:11:54,279
"We have to reside here."

1389
02:12:01,283 --> 02:12:07,790
"Fire the bullet and take my life."

1390
02:12:08,345 --> 02:12:14,946
"Fire the bullet and take my life."

1391
02:12:15,400 --> 02:12:21,735
"Fire the bullet and take my life."

1392
02:12:36,790 --> 02:12:40,493
'In India antique house,
father had a fight with Rajan!'

1393
02:12:41,297 --> 02:12:43,524
'And with this statue,'

1394
02:12:44,392 --> 02:12:47,079
'The bullet found was a .32.'

1395
02:12:50,090 --> 02:12:56,887
'And the body had a .38 caliber bullet.'

1396
02:12:57,258 --> 02:12:58,974
'That did not come from father's gun.'

1397
02:13:01,297 --> 02:13:03,164
- Can I help you?
- No, thank you!

1398
02:13:10,024 --> 02:13:13,477
'That means,
what happened with me today, '

1399
02:13:14,205 --> 02:13:16,917
'could have happened with father too...'

1400
02:13:19,579 --> 02:13:23,534
'And if that's the case,
then father's innocent.'

1401
02:13:36,188 --> 02:13:36,766
Hello!

1402
02:13:36,915 --> 02:13:38,407
Mr. Rana,
trunk call from Delhi.

1403
02:13:38,432 --> 02:13:39,415
- From Delhi?
- Yes, sir.

1404
02:13:40,032 --> 02:13:40,914
Yes connect me please.

1405
02:13:42,064 --> 02:13:42,972
Hello...

1406
02:13:44,158 --> 02:13:45,775
May I speak to Shankar?

1407
02:13:46,462 --> 02:13:47,369
You!

1408
02:13:48,931 --> 02:13:51,720
- Who is speaking?
- I'm his mother.

1409
02:13:56,116 --> 02:13:57,608
He's been gone for the past many days.

1410
02:13:57,750 --> 02:13:59,601
He didn't write to me or gave me a call.

1411
02:13:59,937 --> 02:14:01,906
And it's his birthday today.

1412
02:14:05,072 --> 02:14:07,006
May I speak to him please?

1413
02:14:13,829 --> 02:14:14,798
Hello!

1414
02:14:15,196 --> 02:14:16,016
AMIT'S WIFE: Hello!

1415
02:14:17,204 --> 02:14:19,501
- Hello!
- Janki!

1416
02:14:23,500 --> 02:14:24,265
Janki!

1417
02:14:27,989 --> 02:14:30,899
Who is this?

1418
02:14:32,026 --> 02:14:33,126
It is me...

1419
02:14:33,940 --> 02:14:35,068
...me!

1420
02:14:36,714 --> 02:14:40,181
Time has separated us so...

1421
02:14:41,544 --> 02:14:44,667
...that we can no longer
recognise our voices.

1422
02:14:47,489 --> 02:14:53,039
Janki, I am your Amit.

1423
02:14:56,019 --> 02:14:59,217
Your unfortunate husband, Janki.

1424
02:15:02,258 --> 02:15:03,039
Hello!

1425
02:15:05,070 --> 02:15:05,703
Hello!

1426
02:15:09,407 --> 02:15:12,782
Why are you not speaking, Janki?

1427
02:15:15,140 --> 02:15:16,910
Janki, believe me, it is me.

1428
02:15:27,742 --> 02:15:41,000
"Wherever I see, I see your picture."

1429
02:15:50,744 --> 02:16:03,876
"I saw my future in your face."

1430
02:16:23,258 --> 02:16:31,712
"I'm living for you."

1431
02:16:32,282 --> 02:16:40,860
"My entire life is for you."

1432
02:16:41,689 --> 02:16:46,189
"Whatever is mine...."

1433
02:16:46,251 --> 02:16:55,751
"...is yours, now nothing is mine."

1434
02:16:59,703 --> 02:17:08,547
"My happiness belongs to you."

1435
02:17:09,314 --> 02:17:13,216
"I see it..."

1436
02:17:23,150 --> 02:17:36,571
"Wherever I see, I see your picture."

1437
02:17:55,845 --> 02:18:00,281
"Without seeing..."

1438
02:18:00,553 --> 02:18:04,732
"...without knowing,"

1439
02:18:05,158 --> 02:18:14,204
"we are attached to each other."

1440
02:18:14,454 --> 02:18:18,908
"We'll never,"

1441
02:18:19,142 --> 02:18:23,447
"separate from..."

1442
02:18:23,767 --> 02:18:30,095
"...from each other."

1443
02:18:32,595 --> 02:18:41,384
"Your feelings are like my handkerchief."

1444
02:18:42,033 --> 02:18:45,820
"I see it."

1445
02:18:55,439 --> 02:19:08,769
"Wherever I see, I see your picture."

1446
02:19:18,391 --> 02:19:30,930
"I saw my future in your face."

1447
02:19:50,686 --> 02:19:51,593
Janki!

1448
02:19:54,368 --> 02:19:55,399
Janki!

1449
02:19:57,006 --> 02:19:59,888
You...

1450
02:20:01,914 --> 02:20:03,163
How are you?

1451
02:20:04,845 --> 02:20:07,825
I am all right.

1452
02:20:09,443 --> 02:20:10,987
Are you okay Janki?

1453
02:20:12,784 --> 02:20:13,390
Yes...

1454
02:20:17,144 --> 02:20:19,406
Have patience!

1455
02:20:21,484 --> 02:20:22,797
Don't cry.

1456
02:20:24,683 --> 02:20:28,995
Forgive me Janki!

1457
02:20:30,070 --> 02:20:32,634
I have not done...

1458
02:20:32,916 --> 02:20:35,476
No, don't say that.

1459
02:20:36,719 --> 02:20:38,615
God has listened to my prayers.

1460
02:20:39,619 --> 02:20:43,245
I found you again.

1461
02:20:46,556 --> 02:20:52,516
I want to see you...

1462
02:20:54,293 --> 02:20:57,019
- Janki!
- Yes!

1463
02:20:58,156 --> 02:21:02,156
I am coming there...

1464
02:21:15,183 --> 02:21:15,988
Uncle!

1465
02:21:18,508 --> 02:21:21,964
How come you're here?
No message, no phone call?

1466
02:21:22,445 --> 02:21:24,375
No, I wanted to surprise you.

1467
02:21:24,820 --> 02:21:27,330
Why, everyone's surprising me today?

1468
02:21:27,515 --> 02:21:29,705
Where's Shankar, uncle?
It's his birthday today.

1469
02:21:30,383 --> 02:21:33,365
- Yes, I, too, found out a while ago.
- You?

1470
02:21:34,071 --> 02:21:36,781
Yes, dear. His mother called.

1471
02:21:36,806 --> 02:21:38,955
Really? Janki aunty had called?

1472
02:21:39,865 --> 02:21:40,471
Yes, that...

1473
02:21:42,765 --> 02:21:46,928
Dear, can I give you a surprise, too?

1474
02:21:48,040 --> 02:21:54,344
Your Janki auntie's husband,
that unfortunate man is me.

1475
02:21:54,509 --> 02:21:55,974
Shankar's my son.

1476
02:21:56,610 --> 02:21:58,829
What, Shankar's your son?

1477
02:21:58,900 --> 02:22:00,557
Does he know that you're his father?

1478
02:22:00,790 --> 02:22:01,844
No, Manju, he doesn't.

1479
02:22:02,031 --> 02:22:04,294
- Uncle, I'll tell him about this. Please.
- Okay.

1480
02:22:04,515 --> 02:22:05,757
- Manju.
- Yes?

1481
02:22:07,422 --> 02:22:08,616
Come here, come here.

1482
02:22:10,024 --> 02:22:10,922
Yes, uncle.

1483
02:22:12,061 --> 02:22:19,052
All I hear from you is Shankar?
Why is that so?

1484
02:22:20,131 --> 02:22:21,607
Uncle, there's nothing to it.

1485
02:22:23,053 --> 02:22:26,459
Uncle! Uncle, please!

1486
02:22:28,024 --> 02:22:30,959
Oh, that's the case.
What's there to be so shy about?

1487
02:22:30,984 --> 02:22:35,153
Let me see you. Let's go.
Shankar must be downstairs.

1488
02:22:37,258 --> 02:22:40,717
Shankar? Shankar dear?

1489
02:22:40,904 --> 02:22:41,670
Shankar!

1490
02:22:45,318 --> 02:22:46,232
Shankar!

1491
02:22:47,608 --> 02:22:50,239
Shankar, what's this nonsense?

1492
02:22:50,952 --> 02:22:52,671
What are you doing, Shankar?

1493
02:22:52,718 --> 02:22:55,834
Shankar, move the book away.
Move it away, Shankar.

1494
02:22:56,592 --> 02:22:57,490
Shankar!

1495
02:23:02,130 --> 02:23:03,417
Doomed.

1496
02:23:07,350 --> 02:23:09,821
- Uncle he...
- Shankar...

1497
02:23:10,498 --> 02:23:12,798
- No uncle.
- What are you saying?

1498
02:23:12,988 --> 02:23:15,380
It is not him.
You sent the letter with him.

1499
02:23:15,628 --> 02:23:17,268
I had given a letter
for you but not to him.

1500
02:23:17,293 --> 02:23:21,245
Uncle he is a goon, cheat, a smuggler.
He once trapped me in Delhi.

1501
02:23:21,691 --> 02:23:22,558
Bahadoor?

1502
02:23:24,308 --> 02:23:25,708
Ask him who he is.

1503
02:23:26,465 --> 02:23:27,655
Who are you?

1504
02:23:27,948 --> 02:23:28,659
Tell me!

1505
02:23:29,051 --> 02:23:30,239
Who are you?

1506
02:23:30,792 --> 02:23:31,518
Say it!

1507
02:23:31,619 --> 02:23:33,358
Say...

1508
02:23:39,425 --> 02:23:40,468
I will tell you who he is.

1509
02:23:47,060 --> 02:23:48,570
I will tell you who he is.

1510
02:23:49,752 --> 02:23:51,283
- This is my son.
- Daddy!

1511
02:24:08,261 --> 02:24:08,949
You?

1512
02:24:11,183 --> 02:24:11,917
Vikram!

1513
02:24:12,284 --> 02:24:15,999
I respect your memory.

1514
02:24:16,719 --> 02:24:20,999
You have recognised me with
my beard after 25 years.

1515
02:24:21,144 --> 02:24:22,089
Great!

1516
02:24:22,800 --> 02:24:27,493
You live over here
as Mr. Rana, don't you pal?

1517
02:24:28,981 --> 02:24:33,783
You have collected a lot of wealth,
haven't you? Tell me...

1518
02:24:34,196 --> 02:24:37,270
- ...where is my share of the loot?
- Yours?

1519
02:24:37,534 --> 02:24:39,493
Yes, the one from the diamond necklace...

1520
02:24:40,250 --> 02:24:44,222
- Diamond necklace?
- The one in Shiva's statue...

1521
02:24:44,468 --> 02:24:45,518
Great, pal.

1522
02:24:47,072 --> 02:24:48,168
I don't know!

1523
02:24:48,994 --> 02:24:52,747
He knows nothing. Doesn't know anything?

1524
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,981
He doesn't know anything? You don't know?

1525
02:24:56,731 --> 02:24:57,539
Mac!

1526
02:25:05,308 --> 02:25:06,330
Come on.

1527
02:25:16,949 --> 02:25:19,309
- Listen, you're Mrs. Janki, right?
- Yes.

1528
02:25:19,333 --> 02:25:20,642
- There's a car for you.
- Okay.

1529
02:25:32,335 --> 02:25:33,719
- He didn't come?
- He?

1530
02:25:36,872 --> 02:25:40,949
Oh! Your husband? He has gone away.

1531
02:25:43,590 --> 02:25:45,895
What do you mean? Who are you?

1532
02:25:46,561 --> 02:25:48,825
- You will know soon enough.
- Stop the car.

1533
02:25:49,336 --> 02:25:51,473
Okay. We'll stop it.

1534
02:25:52,126 --> 02:25:55,959
Stop the car, stop the car...

1535
02:25:56,153 --> 02:25:56,848
Yes!

1536
02:25:57,856 --> 02:25:59,910
Stop the car!

1537
02:26:00,278 --> 02:26:01,590
Stop the car!

1538
02:26:01,669 --> 02:26:03,965
Sit down, sit!

1539
02:26:04,934 --> 02:26:06,184
- Drive fast!
- Stop!

1540
02:26:06,700 --> 02:26:07,575
Stop!

1541
02:26:08,153 --> 02:26:09,341
Will you sit or not?

1542
02:26:10,489 --> 02:26:13,856
- You keep driving!
- Leave my hand!

1543
02:26:15,942 --> 02:26:16,873
Catch hold of her!

1544
02:26:58,485 --> 02:26:59,298
Shankar.

1545
02:27:02,023 --> 02:27:03,839
- Son, you're here?
- Son.

1546
02:27:06,271 --> 02:27:09,971
You are getting married here and
you didn't even care to tell me?

1547
02:27:10,169 --> 02:27:13,496
You must've mistaken something.
I am not your son.

1548
02:27:13,839 --> 02:27:15,295
What are you saying?

1549
02:27:15,703 --> 02:27:17,951
I can't recognize my own son?

1550
02:27:18,917 --> 02:27:21,354
One moment. You are really mistaken.

1551
02:27:21,453 --> 02:27:22,457
You are not my mother.

1552
02:27:22,900 --> 02:27:25,892
Yes, son. Why would I be your mother now?

1553
02:27:26,687 --> 02:27:28,991
When fate can take my
husband away from me...

1554
02:27:29,484 --> 02:27:31,939
...it won't be too surprising
if it takes away my son as well.

1555
02:27:32,119 --> 02:27:35,671
- But keep one thing in mind, Shankar...
- One minute. One minute.

1556
02:27:36,663 --> 02:27:38,404
You have really misunderstood something.

1557
02:27:39,190 --> 02:27:44,051
My name is not Shankar. It is Guru.
And this is my mother.

1558
02:27:44,398 --> 02:27:45,257
This is a lie.

1559
02:27:45,574 --> 02:27:50,371
This is our son Guru.
You are unnecessarily troubling us.

1560
02:27:50,610 --> 02:27:52,528
First of all you have snatched
my son away from me...

1561
02:27:52,994 --> 02:27:56,411
...and then you tell me that I'm mistaken?

1562
02:27:59,479 --> 02:28:01,678
You? The doctor?

1563
02:28:02,081 --> 02:28:02,847
Doctor.

1564
02:28:02,872 --> 02:28:07,094
Do you remember 25 years ago
you were there for his delivery...

1565
02:28:07,180 --> 02:28:10,762
...you told me that I
have to keep myself alive,

1566
02:28:10,872 --> 02:28:12,231
to take care of my husband's child.

1567
02:28:12,256 --> 02:28:15,949
They are snatching my child away from me.

1568
02:28:16,116 --> 02:28:18,844
Tell them the truth.

1569
02:28:18,964 --> 02:28:22,063
Tell them this is my son. Doctor?

1570
02:28:22,638 --> 02:28:25,028
Why are you quiet...

1571
02:28:25,313 --> 02:28:29,874
Doctor. Say something, doctor.
Why are you so silent?

1572
02:28:30,124 --> 02:28:31,805
The auspicious moment is passing by.

1573
02:28:32,062 --> 02:28:33,852
Take this mad woman away from this place.

1574
02:28:34,466 --> 02:28:36,116
Mad? I am mad?

1575
02:28:36,323 --> 02:28:39,403
I am not mad. I know my son very well.

1576
02:28:39,540 --> 02:28:42,362
I am his mother.
You can't snatch my son from me.

1577
02:28:42,528 --> 02:28:44,786
Leave me. I am his mother.

1578
02:28:44,959 --> 02:28:45,518
Stop it.

1579
02:28:46,271 --> 02:28:46,930
Leave her.

1580
02:28:49,022 --> 02:28:50,155
Tell me what the problem is.

1581
02:28:51,712 --> 02:28:54,560
Sir, these people are
snatching my son away from me.

1582
02:28:54,954 --> 02:28:56,345
You are like a father to me.

1583
02:28:56,759 --> 02:29:00,399
I swear upon your feet, this is my son.

1584
02:29:00,479 --> 02:29:01,321
Don't cry, child.

1585
02:29:02,057 --> 02:29:04,443
If this is your son,
no one can snatch him away from you.

1586
02:29:05,714 --> 02:29:09,010
Doctor, this woman's tears state
that she is telling the truth.

1587
02:29:09,569 --> 02:29:11,824
And I want to hear that truth from you.

1588
02:29:11,887 --> 02:29:12,386
Mr. Rai...

1589
02:29:12,411 --> 02:29:14,319
Keep quiet,
I want to hear it from the doctor.

1590
02:29:14,997 --> 02:29:15,899
Answer me doctor.

1591
02:29:21,159 --> 02:29:22,261
Answer me!

1592
02:29:22,988 --> 02:29:25,928
Mr. Rai, she is Guru's real mother.

1593
02:29:30,569 --> 02:29:33,298
No. You are joking. This is my mother.

1594
02:29:34,082 --> 02:29:36,421
No. This is your mother.

1595
02:29:37,101 --> 02:29:39,847
If you don't believe me, ask your father.

1596
02:29:39,979 --> 02:29:41,821
Nirmala. Yes sister-in-law.

1597
02:29:42,363 --> 02:29:45,395
When you came to my
hospital for your delivery,

1598
02:29:45,724 --> 02:29:50,404
you once again had a still born child.

1599
02:29:51,756 --> 02:29:54,449
And Janki had given birth to two boys.

1600
02:29:55,011 --> 02:29:56,923
- Two boys?
- Yes.

1601
02:29:57,772 --> 02:30:01,853
And sister-in-law, before you gained
consciousness, brother came to me.

1602
02:30:02,360 --> 02:30:07,191
'I have heard that a woman has
given birth to two babies here?'

1603
02:30:07,291 --> 02:30:07,810
'Yes.'

1604
02:30:07,835 --> 02:30:09,905
'And she has still not
gained consciousness?'

1605
02:30:09,961 --> 02:30:12,606
'If you wish,
you could give one child to...'

1606
02:30:12,639 --> 02:30:19,719
'Brother! No. It cannot happen.
I'm a doctor. Not a thief.'

1607
02:30:19,839 --> 02:30:22,445
'Nirmala, this is not a
robbery, it is a favour.'

1608
02:30:22,831 --> 02:30:24,981
'It is a doctors duty
to save a human life.'

1609
02:30:25,325 --> 02:30:30,270
'You can save your sister-in-law's
life by giving her this child.'

1610
02:30:31,503 --> 02:30:33,643
'Nirmala, have faith in me.'

1611
02:30:34,347 --> 02:30:37,395
'I will keep this a secret all my life.'

1612
02:30:38,598 --> 02:30:41,603
Brother had asked me to keep this secret.

1613
02:30:48,446 --> 02:30:49,461
Mother!

1614
02:30:51,309 --> 02:30:54,449
Your twin brother's name is Shankar!

1615
02:30:55,408 --> 02:30:56,920
Where is father?

1616
02:30:57,128 --> 02:30:59,916
He is right here in this city.
Rana Ranveer Singh.

1617
02:31:02,169 --> 02:31:05,833
I will bring them.

1618
02:31:06,180 --> 02:31:08,004
- You take care of mother, Rita.
- Yes!

1619
02:31:11,050 --> 02:31:12,004
Sir!

1620
02:31:12,770 --> 02:31:13,598
Mr. Rana!

1621
02:31:14,122 --> 02:31:15,082
Mr. Rana!

1622
02:31:16,121 --> 02:31:16,801
Mr. Rana!

1623
02:31:43,190 --> 02:31:50,673
Snake, snake. Don't bite me...

1624
02:31:52,174 --> 02:31:59,840
If you bite me, I will die, let me go!

1625
02:32:00,670 --> 02:32:04,640
Let me go! Get out!

1626
02:32:04,954 --> 02:32:07,579
Snake you...

1627
02:32:07,653 --> 02:32:12,286
You were there, how come you're here?

1628
02:32:12,688 --> 02:32:16,454
I will sit, pray...

1629
02:32:18,134 --> 02:32:19,071
I'll sit!

1630
02:32:22,846 --> 02:32:25,330
Let me go. Let me go.

1631
02:32:25,706 --> 02:32:27,408
Why do you come in my way?

1632
02:32:27,676 --> 02:32:33,369
The family drama is at the
end, I have to meet my father.

1633
02:32:34,346 --> 02:32:38,045
I have a big drama company.

1634
02:32:38,575 --> 02:32:41,296
I will give you a role to play.

1635
02:32:42,174 --> 02:32:45,233
No, no, no. No need for that.

1636
02:32:45,274 --> 02:32:48,274
Why do you get angry?
If you don't want to be an actor, fine.

1637
02:32:48,314 --> 02:32:51,954
Hello. Here, here. Yes.

1638
02:32:53,432 --> 02:32:55,343
Salute sir, salute!

1639
02:32:56,166 --> 02:32:59,408
I'm going, I'm going.

1640
02:32:59,949 --> 02:33:06,080
I am bringing my one leg
sir, I'm falling...

1641
02:33:06,276 --> 02:33:07,737
Again, again.

1642
02:33:09,158 --> 02:33:11,408
Snake, see, I'm standing on one leg?

1643
02:33:11,619 --> 02:33:13,299
I'm standing on one leg?

1644
02:33:13,476 --> 02:33:19,180
Don't bite, snake.
Please, don't. I fell, I fell.

1645
02:33:19,221 --> 02:33:22,166
Snake, don't bite.

1646
02:33:22,424 --> 02:33:24,049
Here, I beg of you.

1647
02:33:26,892 --> 02:33:27,611
Necklace!

1648
02:33:30,281 --> 02:33:37,244
Oh? What is this?
Take this diamond necklace.

1649
02:33:37,798 --> 02:33:40,727
It's not a bribe. Take it. Take it.

1650
02:33:41,291 --> 02:33:43,627
It left. Didn't accept bribe.

1651
02:33:45,596 --> 02:33:48,899
Looks like a government man,
government snake.

1652
02:33:49,158 --> 02:33:49,993
Bye, snake.

1653
02:33:51,273 --> 02:33:51,930
Went away!

1654
02:33:55,651 --> 02:33:56,530
Mr. Rana!

1655
02:33:59,902 --> 02:34:00,542
Sir!

1656
02:34:03,885 --> 02:34:04,682
Mr. Rana!

1657
02:34:05,527 --> 02:34:06,612
Mr. Rana!

1658
02:34:06,916 --> 02:34:07,751
Mr. Rana!

1659
02:34:10,291 --> 02:34:11,751
Mr. Rana!

1660
02:34:13,058 --> 02:34:13,995
Mr. Rana!

1661
02:34:30,946 --> 02:34:40,922
On the stage of life, I got a double role.

1662
02:34:43,486 --> 02:34:44,122
Who are you?

1663
02:34:45,675 --> 02:34:47,228
Where has this necklace come to you from?

1664
02:34:47,306 --> 02:34:50,846
This, the snake sir gave it to me.

1665
02:34:51,451 --> 02:34:52,188
Snake sir?

1666
02:34:52,460 --> 02:34:56,174
Yes? That snake sir...

1667
02:34:58,806 --> 02:35:04,586
He took me to this necklace
and then went away.

1668
02:35:06,114 --> 02:35:07,076
But who are you?

1669
02:35:08,544 --> 02:35:12,517
Your are me and I am you.

1670
02:35:13,724 --> 02:35:17,510
No, you and me, actually are me and you,

1671
02:35:18,504 --> 02:35:22,184
because you and me have became we,

1672
02:35:23,963 --> 02:35:26,886
we are brothers.

1673
02:35:27,346 --> 02:35:28,684
- Brothers?
- Yes.

1674
02:35:29,651 --> 02:35:30,472
Brother!

1675
02:35:31,355 --> 02:35:34,443
Yes, real brothers. Twin brothers.

1676
02:35:35,254 --> 02:35:39,198
Of a single mother and a father.
We share the same blood.

1677
02:35:39,855 --> 02:35:44,039
It is his written word
that sent you with mother,

1678
02:35:44,064 --> 02:35:47,167
and me in someone else's cradle.

1679
02:35:48,818 --> 02:35:50,626
If you don't believe me,
hold me to your heart.

1680
02:35:51,253 --> 02:35:54,979
Our hearts will recognise our blood ties.

1681
02:36:01,934 --> 02:36:03,455
Yes, the heart did recognise, brother.

1682
02:36:05,039 --> 02:36:05,935
Yes.

1683
02:36:07,704 --> 02:36:08,756
The heart recognised it!

1684
02:36:10,464 --> 02:36:11,675
Recognised it!

1685
02:36:14,761 --> 02:36:16,932
What is your name brother?

1686
02:36:18,003 --> 02:36:18,941
Guru!

1687
02:36:25,762 --> 02:36:28,049
- Where is father?
- Father?

1688
02:36:28,704 --> 02:36:30,642
Yes Mr. Rana?

1689
02:36:30,905 --> 02:36:32,027
He is our father.

1690
02:36:33,401 --> 02:36:34,291
Oh!

1691
02:36:34,928 --> 02:36:36,178
So I was right.

1692
02:36:36,869 --> 02:36:37,846
Mr. Rana!

1693
02:36:38,706 --> 02:36:39,487
Mr. Rana!

1694
02:36:39,731 --> 02:36:40,613
Hey listen...

1695
02:36:47,596 --> 02:36:48,542
Listen...

1696
02:36:52,540 --> 02:36:54,440
Who are you?

1697
02:36:55,186 --> 02:36:57,136
I am Mr. Rana's servant.

1698
02:36:58,778 --> 02:37:01,492
A man named Vikram came here.

1699
02:37:02,262 --> 02:37:04,046
He shot me.

1700
02:37:05,502 --> 02:37:07,800
He was looking for a diamond necklace.

1701
02:37:09,165 --> 02:37:16,571
He took Mr. Rana and the
little mistress away with him.

1702
02:37:18,230 --> 02:37:19,347
Vikram!

1703
02:37:19,930 --> 02:37:22,131
I know where he has
taken father and Manju.

1704
02:37:22,795 --> 02:37:26,635
Guru, you take care of him.
I am going to get father.

1705
02:37:26,820 --> 02:37:27,414
And listen...

1706
02:37:35,348 --> 02:37:40,775
Sir, please save my master.

1707
02:37:41,458 --> 02:37:44,825
Please save my master.

1708
02:37:53,333 --> 02:37:57,229
These are the same
goons who were after me.

1709
02:38:00,354 --> 02:38:01,354
Let's go!

1710
02:38:01,806 --> 02:38:06,947
Sister Janki...

1711
02:38:19,667 --> 02:38:20,893
Janki!

1712
02:38:23,987 --> 02:38:25,050
Janki!

1713
02:38:36,580 --> 02:38:37,455
Janki!

1714
02:38:38,359 --> 02:38:38,895
You...

1715
02:38:52,221 --> 02:38:53,375
Inspector Shankar?

1716
02:38:54,277 --> 02:38:57,359
Come, you were missing
from the action. Come...

1717
02:38:58,446 --> 02:39:03,164
You've come at the right time.
Meet your father for the last time.

1718
02:39:05,092 --> 02:39:08,899
No Vikram. I am meeting
my father for the first time.

1719
02:39:10,376 --> 02:39:11,646
And will continue meeting him.

1720
02:39:12,067 --> 02:39:13,242
What is that to me?

1721
02:39:13,562 --> 02:39:16,004
You meet your father once,
ten times, a thousand times.

1722
02:39:16,281 --> 02:39:19,284
Just explain to him that
he should not be stubborn.

1723
02:39:19,713 --> 02:39:21,013
Let him give the necklace to me.

1724
02:39:21,166 --> 02:39:23,973
I swear upon our friendship,
I will let all of you go free.

1725
02:39:25,005 --> 02:39:26,967
If you say the word,
I will take on everybody.

1726
02:39:27,473 --> 02:39:30,486
The wedding hasn't begun yet.
Where are you going to take everyone?

1727
02:39:44,589 --> 02:39:45,339
Shankar!

1728
02:39:50,954 --> 02:39:51,619
My son...

1729
02:40:00,410 --> 02:40:02,049
Father, do as I say.

1730
02:40:11,905 --> 02:40:16,005
- Father, where is that necklace?
- I don't know, son...

1731
02:40:16,731 --> 02:40:20,545
Father that necklace isn't that
important than mother and us, is it?

1732
02:40:21,659 --> 02:40:25,955
Look, you and mother go there
and bring back the necklace to Vikram.

1733
02:40:26,877 --> 02:40:28,769
Until then, we will remain here as surety.

1734
02:40:29,587 --> 02:40:32,560
Wow, an offspring should be like this.

1735
02:40:33,853 --> 02:40:37,443
To save his parents
he is sacrificing himself.

1736
02:40:38,486 --> 02:40:39,885
- Prem!
- Yes dad!

1737
02:40:40,207 --> 02:40:44,707
Go with these guys.
And if they act smart...

1738
02:40:44,825 --> 02:40:46,624
I will finish them off...

1739
02:40:47,730 --> 02:40:49,027
Let's go, Mr. Rana!

1740
02:41:18,003 --> 02:41:18,536
Mother!

1741
02:41:36,237 --> 02:41:39,588
- Idiot.
- I will kill you.

1742
02:41:48,121 --> 02:41:48,668
Prem!

1743
02:41:50,380 --> 02:41:52,080
Ram, Mohan, Mac, cover.

1744
02:41:55,682 --> 02:41:58,033
Come, come soon.

1745
02:42:02,756 --> 02:42:04,692
Where were you for this long?

1746
02:42:05,229 --> 02:42:07,103
- To get the necklace.
- Where is the necklace?

1747
02:42:09,114 --> 02:42:10,852
- With me.
- Give it.

1748
02:42:10,879 --> 02:42:12,985
No. I will give it to Vikram.

1749
02:42:13,312 --> 02:42:16,241
If you try to act smart.

1750
02:42:16,674 --> 02:42:19,472
I'll empty all the bullets
into your brain and kill you.

1751
02:42:19,632 --> 02:42:20,165
Got it.

1752
02:42:21,033 --> 02:42:21,574
Give it to me.

1753
02:42:25,713 --> 02:42:27,244
Now, move.

1754
02:42:28,812 --> 02:42:29,732
Come on!

1755
02:42:42,919 --> 02:42:46,803
Dad today is a big day,
the victory is ours!

1756
02:42:47,292 --> 02:42:51,234
I fixed everybody and
brought the necklace.

1757
02:42:51,303 --> 02:42:52,434
Very good. Give it to me.

1758
02:42:58,242 --> 02:42:58,852
What happened?

1759
02:43:01,944 --> 02:43:02,845
Dad, I had it.

1760
02:43:05,044 --> 02:43:05,997
Hey you!

1761
02:43:06,634 --> 02:43:12,034
You, useless, stupid...

1762
02:43:12,090 --> 02:43:16,387
You cheat.
You work less and talk too much.

1763
02:43:16,748 --> 02:43:18,718
I told you, let me bring the necklace.

1764
02:43:20,039 --> 02:43:21,080
Hold this please.

1765
02:43:22,686 --> 02:43:28,231
Sir, here is your necklace.

1766
02:43:33,216 --> 02:43:34,967
- Dad, we got it.
- Shut up.

1767
02:43:37,737 --> 02:43:39,655
This hair?

1768
02:43:42,817 --> 02:43:44,274
A wig from a drama.

1769
02:43:44,747 --> 02:43:49,061
I am Guru. Do you have
some gum to stick the hair?

1770
02:43:50,605 --> 02:43:51,776
No? Never mind.

1771
02:43:54,360 --> 02:43:55,442
You are very intelligent.

1772
02:43:56,839 --> 02:44:01,270
Sir, you are the only person
to call me intelligent,

1773
02:44:01,366 --> 02:44:03,719
else no one agrees to it.

1774
02:44:05,830 --> 02:44:09,555
Tell me one thing. How many people
do we have of the same face?

1775
02:44:09,778 --> 02:44:12,771
Three, my lord. One father...

1776
02:44:15,148 --> 02:44:19,326
...and two sons.

1777
02:44:19,728 --> 02:44:23,003
Okay. I will take care of you three later.

1778
02:44:23,758 --> 02:44:26,919
First I will find out if this
necklace is real or an imitation.

1779
02:44:27,204 --> 02:44:27,905
- Mac...
- Yes sir?

1780
02:44:28,398 --> 02:44:29,898
- Get Lalchand, the jeweler.
- Yes sir.

1781
02:44:30,347 --> 02:44:33,454
And Prem, take good care of these two.

1782
02:44:41,083 --> 02:44:44,393
- Come sir?
- Yes I will finish you off now.

1783
02:44:44,942 --> 02:44:45,724
Harish!

1784
02:44:48,826 --> 02:44:50,793
What are you doing brother?
If I sprain my back,

1785
02:44:50,834 --> 02:44:53,537
I will be in great trouble.

1786
02:45:00,349 --> 02:45:02,661
Dear! My sweetheart!

1787
02:45:02,709 --> 02:45:04,201
Leave. Leave.

1788
02:45:22,665 --> 02:45:29,490
"What is real, and replica,
will show the world."

1789
02:45:30,069 --> 02:45:36,895
"We'll show the magic,
that they will never forget it."

1790
02:45:37,219 --> 02:45:40,035
"- What say brother?"
"- Right, brother."

1791
02:45:40,635 --> 02:45:44,191
"- What say brother?"
"- Right, brother."

1792
02:45:44,953 --> 02:45:51,766
"What is real, and replica,
will show the world."

1793
02:45:52,196 --> 02:45:59,234
"We'll show the magic,
that they will never forget it."

1794
02:45:59,314 --> 02:46:02,597
"- What say brother?"
"- Right, brother."

1795
02:46:02,677 --> 02:46:06,620
"- What say brother?"
"- Right, brother."

1796
02:46:36,403 --> 02:46:43,478
"Thieves will decide the truth and false."

1797
02:46:44,090 --> 02:46:51,017
"Whose profession is to kill and rob?"

1798
02:46:51,417 --> 02:46:58,376
"Thieves will decide the truth and false."

1799
02:46:58,912 --> 02:47:05,793
"Whose profession is to kill and rob?"

1800
02:47:06,301 --> 02:47:09,926
"They kill for robbery."

1801
02:47:09,967 --> 02:47:13,287
"They enjoy on such wealth."

1802
02:47:13,687 --> 02:47:20,798
"What they have kept in custody,
we'll show it to the world."

1803
02:47:20,878 --> 02:47:24,314
"- What say brother?"
"- Right, brother."

1804
02:47:24,642 --> 02:47:27,954
"- What say brother?"
"- Right, brother."

1805
02:47:28,646 --> 02:47:35,739
"What is real, and replica,
will show the world."

1806
02:47:36,009 --> 02:47:42,929
"We'll show the magic,
that they will never forget it."

1807
02:47:43,055 --> 02:47:46,205
"- What say brother?"
"- Right, brother."

1808
02:47:46,738 --> 02:47:50,401
"- What say brother?"
"- Right, brother."

1809
02:48:13,046 --> 02:48:20,391
"The hands are softer than a flower."

1810
02:48:20,557 --> 02:48:27,493
"The flowers turn into fire,
when time changes."

1811
02:48:27,876 --> 02:48:35,101
"The hands are softer than a flower."

1812
02:48:35,205 --> 02:48:41,374
"The flowers turn into
fire, when time changes."

1813
02:48:42,517 --> 02:48:45,611
"Let's fight..."

1814
02:48:46,029 --> 02:48:49,482
"Let's rock..."

1815
02:48:49,850 --> 02:48:56,770
"He is a goat in lions cover,
we'll show this to the world."

1816
02:48:56,978 --> 02:49:00,726
"- What say brother?"
"- Right, brother."

1817
02:49:00,767 --> 02:49:04,005
"- What say brother?"
"- Right, brother."

1818
02:49:04,030 --> 02:49:11,480
"What is real, and replica,
will show the world."

1819
02:49:11,971 --> 02:49:18,662
"We'll show the magic,
that they will never forget it."

1820
02:49:18,989 --> 02:49:21,942
"- What say brother?"
"- Right, brother."

1821
02:49:22,398 --> 02:49:25,883
"- What say brother?"
"- Right, brother."

1822
02:49:27,324 --> 02:49:30,617
Who? Who?

1823
02:49:30,985 --> 02:49:31,614
Child!

1824
02:49:33,165 --> 02:49:36,805
This necklace is an imitation.
Where is the real necklace?

1825
02:49:38,384 --> 02:49:42,211
Oh lord, this is the real one
and this is the imitation.

1826
02:49:42,417 --> 02:49:47,044
It is what you understand
and how much you understand.

1827
02:49:47,325 --> 02:49:49,707
If you can understand that, understood?

1828
02:49:51,005 --> 02:49:54,652
I didn't say too much, did l?
Hey! Where did he go?

1829
02:49:57,102 --> 02:49:59,401
- Oh! He is here.
- I understood.

1830
02:50:03,024 --> 02:50:06,194
Now I will explain what I have understood.
Look behind you.

1831
02:50:07,045 --> 02:50:08,437
- What?
- Look behind you.

1832
02:50:24,176 --> 02:50:24,891
Father...

1833
02:50:28,702 --> 02:50:32,446
Prem, welcome Amit and sister-in-law.

1834
02:50:45,108 --> 02:50:48,198
Now talk. Will you give
me the real necklace or...

1835
02:50:49,465 --> 02:50:52,135
...wash your hands off your parents? Talk.

1836
02:50:52,352 --> 02:50:54,766
- No.
- Prem!

1837
02:50:55,553 --> 02:51:00,930
Wait, I'll give it to you.

1838
02:51:06,537 --> 02:51:07,850
Brother shoot...

1839
02:51:37,226 --> 02:51:39,745
Got up from the floor,
and the bullet went off.

1840
02:51:40,382 --> 02:51:41,231
Then turned around,

1841
02:51:48,343 --> 02:51:53,072
the bullet went off again, don't shoot.

1842
02:51:54,609 --> 02:51:56,854
Bullets are over, now you can shoot.

1843
02:52:16,997 --> 02:52:19,568
Baby, oh they caught me...

1844
02:52:19,593 --> 02:52:24,303
From here and then...

1845
02:52:24,473 --> 02:52:28,110
...and this in slow motion.

1846
02:52:32,936 --> 02:52:33,764
Run away!

1847
02:52:33,862 --> 02:52:35,645
A head stand on the parallel bars...

1848
02:52:41,897 --> 02:52:46,303
Jump onto the rope, hold on, hold on!

1849
02:52:46,921 --> 02:52:48,873
Keep moving it!

1850
02:52:48,991 --> 02:52:51,780
And that's it. Fire, fire!

1851
02:52:55,546 --> 02:52:59,256
Caught him, leave me, leave!

1852
02:52:59,350 --> 02:53:01,796
Run...

1853
02:53:14,892 --> 02:53:19,362
He twisted my arm, boxing glove....

1854
02:53:23,198 --> 02:53:26,605
Hey, one here. Punch. Come on.

1855
02:53:27,190 --> 02:53:32,010
Boxing, again boxing...

1856
02:53:32,409 --> 02:53:34,972
Hit one, knockout!

1857
02:53:35,619 --> 02:53:37,066
Where are you going?

1858
02:53:41,041 --> 02:53:44,979
Hit him.

1859
02:53:45,220 --> 02:53:50,782
Hit him, hit everyone.

1860
02:53:51,469 --> 02:53:58,019
Hit one, knockout!

1861
02:53:59,047 --> 02:54:02,573
Knockout, knockout...

1862
02:54:07,079 --> 02:54:09,337
Stop it. Arrest everybody.

1863
02:54:16,273 --> 02:54:17,802
Should I run too. Open the door...

1864
02:57:51,881 --> 02:57:52,764
Amit!

1865
02:57:56,686 --> 02:57:58,786
Today is your day of atonement, Vikram.

1866
02:58:03,391 --> 02:58:06,888
Okay, now tell me,
who is being finished now?

1867
02:58:07,116 --> 02:58:09,490
- My fathers...
- Just your father?

1868
02:58:09,650 --> 02:58:11,365
- Mine too.
- Yes, that's right.

1869
02:58:35,537 --> 02:58:40,531
Shankar, please return it to me.

1870
02:58:40,654 --> 02:58:43,467
Shankar, I cannot live without it.

1871
02:58:44,053 --> 02:58:48,198
Shankar, I beg of you, Shankar.

1872
02:58:48,803 --> 02:58:51,053
Shankar...

1873
02:58:52,967 --> 02:58:53,725
Shankar!

1874
02:58:54,811 --> 02:58:56,514
Shankar, give it back!

1875
02:58:56,559 --> 02:58:58,518
You know I cannot live without it.

1876
02:58:59,684 --> 02:59:01,862
Just as you can't live without this,

1877
02:59:02,811 --> 02:59:05,637
the same way I can't live
without knowing the truth.

1878
02:59:06,069 --> 02:59:07,245
Which truth? Which one...

1879
02:59:08,283 --> 02:59:09,942
Who murdered Rajan?

1880
02:59:11,398 --> 02:59:14,779
Rajan was murdered by Amit, your father!

1881
02:59:15,616 --> 02:59:17,344
Who murdered Rajan?

1882
02:59:18,497 --> 02:59:23,787
No Shankar, don't,
don't drop it, please I'll tell you.

1883
02:59:26,142 --> 02:59:28,217
- It was me, I killed Rajan.
- Why did you do it?

1884
02:59:29,515 --> 02:59:31,303
To take revenge, revenge on Amit.

1885
02:59:32,130 --> 02:59:32,798
Revenge? For what?

1886
02:59:34,132 --> 02:59:37,100
Because he sent me to jail.
Now please give it to me...

1887
02:59:37,125 --> 02:59:38,607
Shankar, no...

1888
02:59:55,866 --> 02:59:58,841
15th of the next month is an
auspicious date for both the weddings.

1889
03:00:00,951 --> 03:00:03,226
Are you listening?

1890
03:00:03,756 --> 03:00:07,210
I said 15th of the next month is an
auspicious date for both the weddings.

1891
03:00:07,865 --> 03:00:11,205
So why tell me, tell your sons...

1892
03:00:12,122 --> 03:00:14,513
Shankar, Guru!

1893
03:00:19,662 --> 03:00:20,584
- Yes father!
- Yes mother!

1894
03:00:22,359 --> 03:00:27,159
She's saying that both
your marriages should be...

1895
03:00:31,287 --> 03:00:33,022
Janki, here...

1896
03:00:33,589 --> 03:00:35,384
Who is Shankar, and who is Guru?

1897
03:00:38,512 --> 03:00:39,693
It will be clear in a minute.

1898
03:00:40,444 --> 03:00:42,545
Rita. Manju.

1899
03:00:43,483 --> 03:00:44,139
Yes!

1900
03:00:47,174 --> 03:00:47,800
Yes, aunty.

1901
03:00:48,434 --> 03:00:52,269
Recognise who is Shankar and
who is Guru between them.

1902
03:00:52,519 --> 03:00:54,080
We are unable to recognise them.

1903
03:01:08,703 --> 03:01:13,502
The girls are stumped!
Moustache!

1904
03:01:14,998 --> 03:01:17,411
Hey what are you doing,
they are real, not false ones!

1905
03:01:17,484 --> 03:01:18,191
Leave it.

1906
03:01:19,354 --> 03:01:20,455
Ouch!
