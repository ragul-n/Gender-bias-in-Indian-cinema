All the incidents in the story are imaginary
and does not represent any real person.

2
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,853
Few years earlier...

3
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:42,960
<i>Ticket.. Ticket..</i>
- All of you give it to Salima.

4
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:44,193
How many tickets to college?

5
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:45,735
Eight Tickets to Arts College.

6
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,566
Great, you guys are buying tickets?

7
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,639
Have you joined this year?
- Yes.

8
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,974
l see. Have you all become friends by now?
- No Sir.

9
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:57,741
We were classmates till 12th Std in the school.
- ls it ? Ok.. Ok..

10
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,941
All of us are here?

11
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,482
Muthu Selvam isn't.

12
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,519
Ramesh, you must be knowing?
Where has he gone?

13
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:07,159
l saw him in the School,
when we were getting the mark sheets.

14
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,419
l asked him whether he
would join the college.

15
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,687
He said he may have to get
his father's consent.

16
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,159
l don't know after that.

17
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:13,662
lt will be great if he's around.

18
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,233
<i>We will see.</i>
<i>His bus stop is on the way.</i>

19
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:35,778
<i>AYNGARAN DVD.</i>

20
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,018
Are you in the first year?

21
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,125
Yes.

22
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,258
Which department?

23
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,291
B.A. History.

24
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,891
l see.
Hey he's from our department.

25
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,594
Do you know who we are?

26
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:49,468
No.

27
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,364
We are your seniors.

28
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,040
l'm telling you that we are your seniors.
Won't you respect us?

29
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:57,867
Won't you greet us
a good morning?

30
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,642
Good morning sir.
Good morning.

31
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:00,835
How is it?

32
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,943
Juniors shouldn't stand
in the foot board.

33
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,412
That should be left
for the seniors.

34
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:09,117
Brother, where do you want to go?
- To the college.

35
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:16,289
Here is Muthu.
- Hey, come.

36
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:22,731
Albert, Kamatchi the entire
class league is here.

37
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,062
How are you doing?
- Fine.

38
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,797
You said that you might not join.
- Yes. l thought so.

39
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:31,841
But then some contractor told my
father that l had got many prizes

40
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:37,813
and would get a government
job in the sports quota.

41
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,678
So he had me joined in the
B.A. History course.

42
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,081
Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

43
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,983
We are also in B.A., History.

44
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,349
Oh! Our class league has joined
hands in the college too.

45
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,685
l'm happy for it.

46
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,863
The bus is so empty inside.
Why not you get in?

47
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,626
l struggle every time
the college reopens.

48
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,636
Ramesh, contrary to your usual jubilancy
why are you so silent today?

49
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,097
l have seen these faces
for 12 long years,

50
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,207
how will l tolerate them
for another 3 years?

51
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,071
l just can't be happy.
- Hey!

52
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,075
You haven't changed at all.

53
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:13,742
Yes he hasn't. But, Ramesh.
You should change yourself.

54
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:18,390
Have you started that crab of
lecturing like a grandma?

55
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:22,593
You must stop voicing
your opinion like this.

56
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,195
This is college and not a school.
- They have started their feud.

57
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,662
Look at the way they enjoy.

58
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,436
<i>Are you going to the college for</i>
<i>studying or to rear cows there?</i>

59
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:45,040
Are you really studying
in the college?

60
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,220
Mr. Conductor, why not you warn them?

61
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,549
What to do sir? l'm seeing
them for quite some years.

62
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:55,558
They shout like this.
The freshers shout the same way too.

63
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,593
We should stuff our ears
with cotton and keep going.

64
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,163
This is why every one antagonizes
the college students.

65
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,493
Without teaching in the
freshers with great ideals,

66
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,101
why do you make them shout?

67
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,436
Hey folks, why have they thought like this?

68
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,164
Oh! This is an insult.

69
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:15,370
<i>Our wishes to every one here.</i>

70
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:21,117
<i>We want the folks to be seated.</i>

71
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:37,031
<i>The folks have been seated, already.</i>
<i>You can cut short the story.</i>

72
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,204
<i>Do you know as to what did the boy do</i>

73
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,566
<i>in the morning while going over to college?</i>

74
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:44,572
<i>What is it?</i>

75
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:48,144
<i>Listen to this fable of</i>
<i>Rupees thousand and ten.</i>

76
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,579
<i>They cheat money for to be spent.</i>

77
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:55,242
<i>Listen sir....listen madam.</i>

78
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:59,721
<i>Listen one and all.</i>

79
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:03,054
<i>Give way...get down!</i>
<i>Grandma...get in.</i>

80
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,989
<i>Get in quickly madam.</i>
<i>Get in....get in...</i>

81
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,329
<i>Do you know how does he go in a bus?</i>

82
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,733
<i>How brother?</i>

83
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,171
<i>He goes hanging like a monkey does.</i>

84
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:22,178
<i>The moment he enters the bus</i>
<i>- Yes he does.</i>

85
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,442
<i>He runs behind a moving bus,</i>

86
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:28,279
<i>Leaving the one that is near & ready.</i>

87
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,547
<i>He runs behind a moving bus.</i>
<i>- Yes he does.</i>

88
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:36,686
<i>On seeing the girls around</i>
<i>he climbs over the window.</i>

89
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,296
<i>He creates a scene.</i>

90
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:44,492
<i>Alarmed over this,</i>
<i>Conductor calls the boy up.</i>

91
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,331
<i>Will he stay with his mouth shut?</i>

92
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,667
<i>He teases the conductor</i>
<i>and starts singing.</i>

93
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,777
<i>Oh brother, what was that song about?</i>

94
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,140
<i>On going home the parents trouble you.</i>

95
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,509
<i>Oh yes Ramu., oh yes Somu.</i>

96
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,844
<i>When you team up in the</i>
<i>road the police trouble you.</i>

97
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,179
<i>Oh yes Ramu., oh yes Somu.</i>

98
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,583
<i>lf you come in the bus,</i>
<i>the conductor troubles you.</i>

99
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,816
<i>Oh yes Ramu., oh yes Somu.</i>

100
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,890
<i>lf you go to the college</i>
<i>the principal troubles you.</i>

101
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,529
<i>Oh yes Ramu., oh yes Somu.</i>

102
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,460
<i>On seeing all this,</i>
<i>the conductor is irritated.</i>

103
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,792
<i>He wants the boy to get in.</i>

104
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,491
<i>Once he gets in will the</i>
<i>boy stop his fun?</i>

105
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:20,035
<i>Brother, what did he do there?</i>

106
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:26,576
<i>He runs in to the crowd and</i>
<i>touch the girls around.</i>

107
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,974
<i>Yes he does.</i>

108
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:35,485
<i>The desperate girl is not able</i>
<i>to speak against</i>

109
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,815
<i>yes she does.</i>

110
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:41,482
<i>On thinking, that this doesn't</i>
<i>concern them.</i>

111
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:46,688
<i>No one has taken note of it though.</i>

112
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:53,327
<i>People should revolt</i>
<i>Revolt against this atrocity.</i>

113
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,837
<i>Yes they should.</i>

114
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:59,341
<i>Our college girls are coming.</i>
<i>Give way.</i>

115
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:00,671
<i>Come fast.</i>
<i>- Coming.</i>

116
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,505
<i>Right..right.</i>

117
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:03,840
<i>After all that fun in the bus,</i>
<i>the happy lad</i>

118
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,847
<i>must have studied well</i>
<i>in the college.</i>

119
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,019
<i>Do you know what he did there?</i>

120
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,917
<i>What did he do?</i>

121
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:16,584
<i>He lights up the flame to smoke.</i>

122
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:21,733
<i>He drinks without his parent's knowledge,</i>
<i>and goes astray too.</i>

123
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:26,735
<i>lnfluenced by cinema</i>
<i>he falls in love,</i>

124
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:32,002
<i>He fails to distinguish</i>
<i>between love & lust.</i>

125
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:36,910
<i>He doesn't respect his parents</i>
<i>and gets spoiled.</i>

126
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:41,677
<i>He doesn't realize that those are</i>
<i>wrong deeds. lf pointed out, he revolts.</i>

127
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,782
<i>Our jolly good lad had</i>
<i>finally fallen in love.</i>

128
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:50,725
<i>Do you know how he proposed?</i>
<i>- How did he?</i>

129
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,127
<i>lf you are born as a girl</i>
<i>You should be humble.</i>

130
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,632
<i>lf you are so,</i>
<i>l will feel like loving you.</i>

131
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:04,743
<i>And l will love you for ever,</i>
<i>ln your absence l will feel like dying.</i>

132
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:11,782
<i>Do accept me in your league,</i>
<i>We will happily marry.</i>

133
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:12,916
<i>Having sung the way he did,</i>

134
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,347
<i>He somehow managed</i>
<i>to win her heart.</i>

135
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,352
<i>That girl was loving him too.</i>

136
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,958
<i>On knowing it, do you know</i>
<i>what did her parents did?</i>

137
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:24,128
<i>They made her marry another person.</i>
<i>Will the boy be silent?</i>

138
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,494
<i>He asked them a rightful question.</i>

139
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:30,032
<i>What was it, brother?</i>

140
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:34,366
<i>The unjust God of love</i>
<i>- God.</i>

141
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,975
<i>To be against love is a sin,</i>
<i>- Sin.</i>

142
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:45,606
<i>Oh no, My heart is aching.</i>
<i>- Yes it does.</i>

143
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:50,151
<i>Do you know what had</i>
<i>happened finally?</i>

144
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:53,382
<i>What happened?</i>

145
00:09:53,893 --> 00:10:08,137
<i>He is now in deep troubles.</i>

146
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:15,509
<i>He lags behind and is far from growth.</i>
<i>Yes he does.</i>

Where is our class room?

Hey Kayal, Ramesh, here's our class...
come let's get in..

Our friend has discovered.

This girl is our class too.
l can't believe she looks superb.

158
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,880
You will start, right away.
- Hey, won't you look at them?

159
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:39,420
Look at these girls they feel
lacking before her..

160

Won't you keep quiet?

Look at Aadhilakshmi.
She comes in awe for her..

162
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,265
Hey, don't set fire on her
with your very eyes.. go.

163

No.

164

Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Be seated.

165
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,545
Not necessary to say a ''Good Morning''
as you did in the school.

166
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,081
You could just stand up.

167

Why did you join this course?

226

l want to apply for lAS examination.

227
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,017
That's why l have joined this course.

228

Good. Good...she is going
to write her lAS..

229
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,083
Only she knows the value
of this course.

230
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,018
Why did you prefer this college?

231
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:35,593
Sir, l have joined just temporarily
for some personal reason.

232
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:38,770
l'm waiting for the admission card
from Birla Academy, Delhi.

233
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,138
Sir, what did she say?

234
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,065
She has joined this college
just temporarily..

235
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,909
lf she gets a placement in Delhi
Birla Academy, she will leave.

236
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:53,408
Birla Academy is very famous
for its History Department.

237
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,649
lndia's topnotch people study here.

238
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,456
To get a placement in that college
is indeed a rare thing.

239
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:01,284
<i>Good.</i>

240
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:05,661
Oh, l felt very happy that a superb girl
has come in to our class.

241
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,096
She is also leaving, half way.

242
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,230
<i>Hmm...our destiny is to stick on</i>
<i>to these familiar faces.</i>

243
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:14,500
<i>Hey at school we used to eat</i>
<i>under a shade, right?</i>

244
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:15,731
<i>We will find a place like that.</i>

245
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,238
Shall we sit here and eat?

246
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:18,967
This place is full of trash...
We will find another.

247
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,736
Hey, l'm hungry,
we will sit here itself.

248
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,208
She is telling you to find another..

249
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:23,847
Come here...we shall try finding it
in the ground.

250
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:24,811
We will go with her.

251
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,986
<i>What place will she look for?</i>
<i>Why are you following for?</i>

252
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,984
Hey, here is a tree shade...
Come..

253
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,554
<i>Hey, this glutton junky has</i>
<i>found a place... come...</i>

254
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,157
<i>Why are you scolding her?</i>
<i>She has found a nice place..</i>

255
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,952
<i>Here we have water..</i>

256
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,326
Have you washed your hands?
- No

257
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:42,022
ls it a good habit to eat
without washing hands?

258
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:43,900
She has started pestering...

259
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:47,462
Kayal, take this tomato rice..

260
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,766
Take my porridge.
- Muthu, take some curd rice..

261
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,067
Gulp this egg too..

262
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,871
Ramesh, take this hot sour idly.

263
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:54,477
Hey Junky, take dosa..

264
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,374
Here is for you, Ayyanaar...

265
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,448
Salima, l thought you would bring
biryani on the first day.

266
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,617
But you have brought chapathi..

267
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:03,219
My father had an operation
for chest pain,

268
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,720
The Doctor has wanted
to abstain from meat.

269
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:09,155
So only vegetarian food for him & we too.
- How is he, now?

270
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:10,791
Sort of.. All right..

271
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,738
The Bangalore girl is sitting alone..

272
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,768
Kayal, shall we call her?

273
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,940
Will she join us?

274
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:35,112
She seems to be coming from a rich family.
She will not come our way.

275
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,753
<i>Yes. She was dull in the class too.</i>

276
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,822
An English speaking girl
will not talk to us.

277
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,617
Hey, don't pretend.

278
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,022
You are jealous that she looks
more beautiful than you all.

279
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,220
So you aren't calling her.
Accept the fact.

280
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,226
Nagarani, now see this...

281
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:55,530
Move.. l'll have to enjoy watching
her before she leave to Delhi.

282
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,969
Aren't you ashamed?

283
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,371
What have l done to feel so?

284
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,111
Are you showing male arrogance?

285
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,682
ls it wrong if the boys take a look
at the beautiful dames?

286
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:09,945
To look at girls and to fall
in love is not manliness.

287
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,826
To respect her as a friend
and fellow being is.

288
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:17,387
You have been with us
for all these years.

289
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,656
Yet you behave in such a filthy way...
ls it the way you respect friendship?

290
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,902
Why are you taking this serious?
He wants to make fun of you.

291
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,438
He will speak everything
and then will call it fun.

292
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:31,573
This is more cowardly, than that.

293
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,541
You are talking a lot..
l will be furious..

294
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,873
Hey don't talk..
Kayal, will you stop that?

295
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:40,711
No Muthu.. you guys will speak
anything and will keep going.

296
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,611
You will understand if you see
from our point of view..

297
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,189
Our parents have believed you
so as to let us be your friends.

298
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:47,756
ls this the respect you show to them?

299
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,120
<i>ls it the way to behave?</i>

300
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:52,530
What Muthu? l spoke for fun
and she is taking it too far..

301
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,322
l am responsible as well.

302
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,091
Having been together for all these years
and if you don't understand a friend,

303
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,564
<i>it is a waste to be so.</i>

304
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,796
You aren't eligible to talk about friendship
any more. Don't talk to me.

305
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,668
<i>You are nagging for every damn thing.</i>

306
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,736
Hey Kayal, where are you going?

307
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,573
Let her go.. why to go behind her?

308
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,009
Why have you done it, Ramesh?

309
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,547
Don't you have any brain?

310
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,912
What Muthu?
The first day has gone like this?

311
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,245
He doesn't know what to talk and when.
Fool.

312
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,083
<i>Ramesh will not keep his mouth shut.</i>

313
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:23,091
<i>Unless on her own, it will now</i>
<i>be very difficult to console her.</i>

314
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,092
<i>To look at girls and to fall in</i>
<i>love is not manliness..</i>

315
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,936
<i>To respect her as a</i>
<i>friend & fellow being is..</i>

316
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,433
What Muthu, Kayal hasn't turned up yet?

317
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,577
All because of what Ramesh has done.

318
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:49,015
<i>AYNGARAN DVD.</i>

319
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,781
<i>Quick. Get down.</i>

320
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,854
<i>He's also going overboard.</i>

321
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,218
What shall we do?

322
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,888
You keep going. l will bring him.

323
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,729
<i>Right.. we shall go.</i>

324
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:05,966
Ramesh..

325
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,061
Yes. l am bad..

326
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:09,672
l will smoke, cut classes and
look at the girls around.

327
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,504
Don't be my friend.
Go away and abstain from advising.

328
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,847
Whatever that she does is right
and what l do is wrong. lsn't it?

329
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,476
You will keep falling at her..

330
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:22,881
What did she say?

331
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,450
l'm speaking frankly, Ramesh..

332
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:27,984
She was cent percent right.

333
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,224
l accept it shamelessly.

334
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:35,558
l have also looked at the Bangalore girl.

335
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:36,997
Yes Ramesh.

336
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:40,296
l am sorry that l've not
revealed it to you.

337
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:47,307
When Kayalvizhi asked so l felt ashamed too.
l have changed my self.

338
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,848
We can easily scold her
and make her shut up.

339
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,017
But think of her qualities.

340
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:57,149
She stands first in helping others.

341
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,788
she will even give her life for
the sake of friendship.

342
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:03,391
lf you speak like that,
won't she be angry?

343
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,688
lf you want our friendship to last long,
you both should speak.

344
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:13,031
Come, let's go.

345
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:14,603
Wait. Let me smoke.

346
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:16,768
Won't you stop this damn stuff?

347
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:19,535
See you, dad..

348
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:20,976
Oh is it she?

349
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:23,473
Come, Kayal.

350
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:27,043
<i>Muthu...Ramesh...</i>

351
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:27,877
Sir!

352
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,445
How are you, doing?
- Fine.- l'm fine too.

353
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,146
How are you doing?
- l'm fine.

354
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:35,815
She told me that all the school friends
have joined in the same college.

355
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,962
Yes.
- l'm so glad.

356
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,892
Be together & study well.
- Yes. We will.

357
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,862
Let me take leave..
- Ok, dad..

358
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:45,600
Why are you taking her this far?

359
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:47,564
Could have sent her in a bus..

360
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,733
Yesterday she came in a bus, right?

361
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:58,174
lt's because of me..
She started late and the bus left..

362
00:21:58,383 --> 00:21:59,748
Ok. l'll leave now..
- Okay.

363
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,253
Muthu, let's go.

364
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,452
Hey, wait.

365
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,192
Kayal, please wait.
He will be back in a minute.

366
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:13,856
Leave it man..
You wouldn't die without that..

367
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:20,931
lt's waste to tell him.

368
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,635
He is someone who you can't change..

369
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:27,742
Hello brothers..

370
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,414
Do you have a match box?

371
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,021
He is asking you, right? Answer him..

372
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:39,213
lsn't he asking you? You tell him..

373
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:48,560
You tell him.. Won't you speak...
- You tell him.. Why wouldn't you do it?

374
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,132
l swear that l'll quit smoking.

375
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:53,370
They say that Bangalore girls smoke..
Do they?

376
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:00,170
They say Bangalore girls drink beer..
Do they?

377
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:02,606
<i>How many boy friends you have?</i>

378
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:06,916
S. Muthuselvan. First B.A., History.
100 meters.

379
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:08,584
<i>Come here, boy.</i>

380
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:13,081
You are running great.
But you seem to lack practice.

381
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:20,021
Yes sir, we go by what our school
PT master had taught us then.

382
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,826
l see. Now you would have
understood the value of practice.

383
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:23,659
Yes sir.

384
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:24,836
Ok l want you to be regular to the ground.

385
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:29,837
whether college is there or not practice will
go on holidays too, l'm here always.

386
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:30,507
OK, sir.

387
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,176
You can now go to the class..
- Thank you sir,

388
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:35,107
<i>They say girls flirt with boyfriends, do they?</i>

389
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:42,683
l pity that girl, Ramesh.

390
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,356
Why is she taking it far?

391
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:49,516
<i>Hey.. you have just come together, Ramesh.</i>
<i>Don't start quarreling again.</i>

392
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,620
Why are you looking tensed..?

393
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,331
Look, seniors are ragging
that Bangalore girl.

394
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,661
On seeing that she has become favour.

395
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:00,496
Why are you keeping mum?

396
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,800
Say something.

397
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:05,738
Muthu, ragging is a crime, right?
- Yes.

398
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:09,141
Then when l ask you to take her back
why is he speaking against?

399
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:11,212
Hey.. do you think this
to be your school.

400
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:15,580
lf you a pick a quarrel with seniors,
they will write you off..

401
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,880
He will say only this..
l pity her, Muthu..

402
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,080
Hey, is he one of us?

403
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:23,556
She will soon be settling down
at Delhi..leave it..

404
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,559
Whatever it be she is from our class..

405
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:29,928
So what? You want me to go
and fight with those boys..?

406
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:31,931
Just wait..

407
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:36,103
Nagarani, come here..
- What Muthu?

408
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,205
Will you do l say..
- l will.

409
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,171
Come here..

410
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:41,874
Ok.

411
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:47,274
Why are you keeping your mouth shut?
You just can't do without speaking.

412
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,249
Good morning sir...good morning sir...

413
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,749
<i>Why Shobana?</i>
<i>Where are all l've to search for you?</i>

414
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:57,717
Why are you standing here?
Your father called up. Let's go.

415
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:03,527
Hey, l'm talking to her.
You can't take her like this..

416
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,772
Good morning sir...
what's the matter, sir?

417
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,804
We are talking to her..

418
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:14,308
She came, she saw and
she took her back..

419
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,445
<i>Why did you do that?</i>

420
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,616
How many times have l warned you
not to do that way?

421
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,785
Go and apologize.. go..

422
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,710
Not that...
- What?

423
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:25,014
She got a call from her father,
l came to tell her..

424
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:26,986
You would have told him that in Tamil.

425
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,160
Don't mistake her.
They are relatives.

426
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:33,127
She came to inform her about
her father's urgent phone call.

427
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:36,994
Frightened, she had blabbered in Telugu.
Forgive her.

428
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:39,868
lts all right.. Let her go..

429
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:42,631
Thank you very much sir.
Take her back..

430
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:46,908
Thanks, sir.

431
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:50,908
Telugu..

432
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,110
ls it why she hasn't spoken at all?

433
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:57,620
Perhaps a Naidu.
May be lyer or even lyengar.

434
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,921
What ever be the caste,
to sum it up, she is jolly good.

435
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,494
How did you get trapped?

436
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:08,097
Had she come with us she wouldn't have.
She came alone.

437
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,325
l told you on the other day
to call her for the lunch..

438
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:13,868
Kayal didn't allow us..
- She was keeping mum..

439
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,597
So, she was hesitant to call her.

440
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:20,375
lt was my mistake.

441
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,271
l shouldn't have been so.

442
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:34,390
But then l was not able to speak up
because l had lost my mom.

443
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,952
She died before my eyes.

444
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:43,091
<i>With such a shock behind,</i>
<i>l could not study there.</i>

445
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:56,413
My father had joined me here, temporarily.

446
00:26:56,982 --> 00:27:01,112
l couldn't forget my mom and
thats the reason for my silence.

447
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,919
l'm sorry, Shobana.
Only we had mistaken you.

448
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,201
l feel sad too.

449
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:21,837
But then if you keep dwelling in those
thoughts you will breakdown.

450
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:27,969
All of us in this world live
with some problem or the other.

451
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:31,307
Here you see, Muthu,
his mother is also dead.

452
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:38,053
<i>He is so fond of his mother.</i>

453
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:39,423
She is Salima.

454
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:43,253
<i>Salima's father has just under</i>
<i>gone a bypass surgery.</i>

455
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:44,587
<i>Yet his chest pain hasn't</i>
<i>dwindled and is suffering.</i>

456
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:48,424
<i>Ayyanar is a bright student.</i>

457
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,933
<i>His parents are too poor</i>
<i>to send him for studies.</i>

458
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,063
Kamakshi is a rich boy.

459
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,942
But he is so innocent and
that's his problem..

460
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,703
<i>He gets easily cheated by everyone.</i>

461
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:06,973
She is Aadhilakshmi...
Her parents are agricultural labourers..

462
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:10,643
<i>she studies with a single dream of</i>
<i>looking after her parents till the very end.</i>

463
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,015
<i>Very strong girl..</i>

464
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:18,723
For Albert his sole problem
is his father..

465
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,561
<i>a drunkard who beats them</i>
<i>all on every passing day.</i>

466
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:27,395
For Nagarani, l don't know why
but she suffers from fits?

467
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:32,270
He is Ramesh, a jolly good boy
only in the college..

468
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:36,674
<i>His father dislikes his college studies and</i>
<i>makes him toil with many jobs.</i>

469
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,112
And take my case..

470
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:42,486
My father has five daughters,
including me.

471
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:46,190
Two elder and two younger sisters
work in a tiny industry.

472
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,517
They send me to this college..

473
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,727
All the seven of us live in
that very little home.

474
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,091
Like this though we are
surmounted with problems.

475
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,157
lf all the friends come together

476
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:58,199
we will forget everything and be merry
and happy with infinite smiles..

477
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,631
This is our friendship.

478
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:19,246
<i>AYNGARAN DVD.</i>

479
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,983
<i>What were you talking</i>
<i>to her yesterday?</i>

480
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,286
l was talking to her about us
and about our families.

481
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,564
She felt consoled.

482
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:27,523
ls it?

483
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:28,858
Hi!

484
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:30,663
Good morning friends.

485
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:31,927
Good morning.

486
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,377
Hey Kayalvizhi, what is our first class?

487
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:41,044
English.

488
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:44,215
English??
Hey folk did you hear that?

489
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:44,904
<i>Sit quietly.</i>

490
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,641
We won't understand anything.
We will sneak out for a movie..

491
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:48,318
No.

492
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,281
Come on.
We will go.

493
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:51,021
Shall we?

494
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:53,281
No. She will think bad of us..

495
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,720
Hey, you don't understand English.
Then why not you come?

496
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:57,721
Yes. Shall we?
- No..

497
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,226
Folks aren't you coming?

498
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,260
You go.

499
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,860
Why aren't you coming?

500
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,500
No one is coming, right?

501
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,037
<i>Good morning sir.</i>

502
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,638
<i>Good morning. Sit down.</i>

503
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,108
Get off..

504
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,742
You did not come, right?

505
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,276
Khublakhan..

506
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:19,310
Khublakhan.

507
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:24,084
Where the sacred river ran through heaven

508
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:30,086
measureless to a man down to a sunless sea.

509
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:37,493
with walls & towers were round.

510
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,067
Did you understood anything?

511
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,828
We don't understand, sir.

512
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:45,843
lts not enough that one person
understand it, sit down.

513
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:49,672
Did you all understand?

514
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:51,280
No sir..

515
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:53,677
l know that you wouldn't.

516
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,521
All of you have come from
a Tamil Medium.

517
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:58,689
Yes sir..

518
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,950
And that too,
you have come from villages.

519
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,184
He is right.

520
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:05,862
You have English in the
first two years.

521
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:07,998
You will be eligible for the degree,
only if you get through in English.

522
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:10,699
lf l teach English lessons
you will not understand.

523
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:11,391
Yes sir.

524
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:15,562
lf l teach in Tamil perhaps l may not be
able to finish off the portions.

525
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:24,704
So l have prepared this notes for you,
with Tamil commentary.

526
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:29,410
The cost of it is very less.
lt costs only forty rupees.

527
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:31,885
He is a better business man
than my dad..

528
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:37,222
All of you should buy this.
You don't have to pay it immediately.

529
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:38,395
Pay at will.

530
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:41,690
Take this for you.
- l will get it later.

531
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,594
And you?
- One for me, sir.

532
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,464
And for you?

533
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:47,498
He is asking you, right? Tell him.

534
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,195
You tell him..

535
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,238
<i>Why not you? You tell him.</i>

536
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:52,466
<i>Why don't you say?</i>

537
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:54,008
<i>Why don't you?</i>

538
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,008
Leave me, you please tell him..

539
00:31:56,214 --> 00:32:01,481
<i>Hey, you tell him..</i>

540
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,119
They seem to be real nuts.

541
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:09,419
<i>You tell him..</i>
<i>- You tell him..</i>

542
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:13,925
We've never seen you in the bus at all.

543
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:14,598
l'm..

544
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,164
They won't come in the bus
like the rest of us.

545
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:17,664
Will have a vehicle of their own.

546
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,767
l am going to come with you in bus.
Shall l?

547
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,166
Sure..

548
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:25,171
And then, you don't have to
call me with respect..

549
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:27,207
Ok we won't..

550
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:30,206
<i>Nagarani can speak well..</i>

551
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:32,542
<i>Do you all eat together?</i>

552
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,775
<i>While at school all the nine of</i>
<i>us would eat together.</i>

553
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:37,614
<i>From now on, in the college</i>
<i>we will be ten of us..</i>

554
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,181
Excuse me..

555
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:42,951
My daddy...

556
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:44,622
You could eat...

557
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:45,853
lt's all right...

558
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:46,789
<i>Hello Shobana...</i>

559
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:47,862
Hi daddy..How are you?

560
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:49,294
<i>l'm fine.. How are you?</i>

561
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:49,966
Absolutely, l am fine.

562
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:50,964
<i>Are you free now?</i>

563
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,293
Anything important?

564
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:53,060
<i>Nothing like that.</i>

565
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:53,896
<i>Daddy can you call later.</i>

566
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:55,265
<i>Ok, Shobana. Take care..</i>

567
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,134
Ok Dad.. Bye.

568
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,407
Will you talk in English at home?

569
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,975
Yes. Certainly.

570
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:04,615
lf otherwise, my school would
charge us with a fine.

571
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,808
So we would speak and
practice at home.

572
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:10,782
<i>What will happen if we start</i>
<i>speaking in English at home?</i>

573
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:13,991
Daddy.. Daddy.

574
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,558
Daddy.

575
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:20,322
'' Daddy '' ?
Do you hail from a British Lord's family?

576
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:24,661
Daddy.. Daddy..Daddy.

577
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:25,665
What are you saying?

578
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,303
Daddy...

579
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,572
Daddy.. Oh.. Daddy..

580
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:33,742
Daddy...

581
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,338
What do you mean?

582
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:37,305
Are you making fun of my beard?

583
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:41,578
How dare you are?
- Daddy means father.

584
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,347
Why are you laughing?

585
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:48,584
What Muthu??

586
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:49,851
ln your family every one is learned.

587
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,358
That's not the case with our families.

588
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,688
We thought of it and laughed.
What else could we do?

589
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:54,954
Sorry.. Sorry.. Sorry.

590
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,794
l didn't mean to insult you.

591
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:01,096
We are not mistaking you.
We understand.

592
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,535
Actually to speak in English
is not a big deal.

593
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,174
Even you can talk in English.

594
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,209
ls it? Shobana, teach us
some words in English.

595
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:09,710
You can't change him at all.

596
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:12,773
You just cannot teach it, Ramesh.

597
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,542
You got to learn it by speaking.

598
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:17,448
We all want to speak English,
like you. ls it possible?

599
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:18,378
Yes, indeed.

600
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:20,386
But you all have to be co-operative.

601
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:21,558
Yes. We will.

602
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:24,159
The next time when you talk to me
you should talk in English.

603
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:24,953
ls it ok?

604
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:26,061
Only then you will be able to.

605
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:27,731
lt doesn't matter if you make mistakes.

606
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:30,992
Do talk courageously.
Shall we start?

607
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:35,071
Not today.
We will start speaking from tomorrow.

608
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:37,066
Ok?

609
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:37,798
Ok.

610
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,604
Good morning.

611
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:40,800
Good Morning.

612
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:42,579
Shall we start?

613
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:47,710
No.

614
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,484
Salima..

615
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:52,919
<i>Muthu could you please try?</i>

616
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,322
Some one should speak.

617
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:56,890
''l will talk''.

618
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,461
Oh.. Thats good.
l appreciate you, Ramesh.

619
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:00,822
''Thank you''.

620
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:04,601
Tell me one thing.
Why is everybody keeping mum?

621
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:09,498
Tell me, Ramesh.

622
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:10,833
Caught...!

623
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:17,470
Shobana, l can understand
what you are saying.

624
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:22,079
But l'am not able to answer you.

625
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:25,349
We were facing the same problem.
And we didn't say anything.

626
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:26,750
You talked like one dude.

627
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:28,288
Ok, Ramesh.
You should always try like this.

628
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,188
<i>Get down, please.</i>
<i>The bus will not go further.</i>

629
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:31,691
<i>What is the problem, conductor?</i>

630
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,193
<i>There is a dispute between</i>
<i>the party men.</i>

631
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:35,058
<i>They are breaking the buses,</i>
<i>that are bound this way.</i>

632
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,700
<i>So, this bus will not go any further.</i>
<i>Get down.</i>

633
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,105
<i>We will leave this area of agitation.</i>

634
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,709
<i>Go fast.</i>

635
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:51,211
<i>They fight among themselves</i>
<i>& ruin our lives.</i>

636
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,380
<i>To hell with them.</i>

637
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,210
<i>We shouldn't vote to any party hereafter.</i>

638
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:55,908
How? Shall we go to the college?

639
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,315
They are in a rampage.
Why to talk about going to College?

640
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:01,321
Ramesh, we will rush home.
- Come, let's go.

641
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:02,390
We will avoid the main road.

642
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:03,560
And will go through the lanes.

643
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:07,898
We will leave the girls in their homes.

644
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:08,724
And then we can go.

645
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:09,991
Where shall we go?

646
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:10,929
To Shobana's home.

647
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:12,227
lts all right. l will go myself.

648
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,199
You have to come with us.
- You don't know about this.

649
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,065
<i>There isn't any problem there, right?</i>

650
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,332
<i>Nothing sister..</i>

651
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:22,341
<i>The Party men are running a riot.</i>
<i>We will go away.</i>

652
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,412
<i>Yes, Muthu.</i>
<i>Go that way girls.</i>

653
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:28,915
<i>lf anyone opens the shops,</i>
we will destroy it.

654
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:31,318
<i>Destroy the shops.</i>

655
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,422
<i>Come Slowly.</i>
<i>They will not do anything.</i>

656
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:35,558
<i>Hey why are you running?</i>

657
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:37,784
<i>They will only break the shops.</i>
<i>Don't Panic.</i>

658
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,492
<i>The bike man is trapped.</i>

659
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,437
<i>Torch the bike.</i>

660
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,539
<i>Party men will quarrel only</i>
<i>among themselves.</i>

661
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:51,605
<i>They wouldn't do anything to us.</i>

662
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:52,468
<i>Don't be frightened.</i>

663
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:54,338
<i>They are coming as a gang</i>
<i>with loads of knifes and sickles.</i>

664
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,569
<i>How can we be not afraid?</i>

665
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,943
These ruffians have broken this too.

666
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,048
How to go from here?

667
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,185
ls there anyway out?

668
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,250
Hey, who has done this?

669
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:05,012
Those party fellows.

670
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:05,712
Give that to me.

671
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:06,719
Salima, take this.

672
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:09,017
<i>Guys, get down.</i>
<i>We will lift this up.</i>

673
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,218
<i>Be careful.</i>
<i>There may be glass pieces around.</i>

674
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:12,588
Muthu, Slowly.

675
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:14,889
<i>Why did they broken this?</i>

676
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:17,693
<i>There is a party office, around.</i>
<i>So, they broke this too.</i>

677
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:19,095
<i>Hey, lift this up from that side.</i>

678
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,563
<i>don't make it fall on your legs.</i>

679
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:29,605
<i>Carefully.. girls go away.</i>

680
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:31,213
<i>Keep them closer.</i>

681

683

Some more of it, there.

684
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,384
Oh mother, come carefully.

685
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,321
lf not for these boys,
how could we ever manage to cross this?

686

What Grandpa?

692
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:00,276
We were so afraid.

693
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:02,139
They say there is a wide spread
agitations in the town.

694
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:06,783
You should have called up.
We were alarmed.

695
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:09,410
How did you come alone?

696
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,214

My friends took me here.

697
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:13,981
Then, call them in.

Shobana, you were telling me
that you didn't like this college.

713

But then, the students are so good.

Yes granny.

715
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:00,234
lnitially, l had a wrong thought.

716
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:01,962
They are not like that.

717
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:05,298

He is angry with me.

''Friendship'' is nothing
before ''love''.

Every friendship between a man and

No one claims,
at first that they are in love.

850
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,147
They will call them to be ''Friends''.

851
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:43,258
Then they will say that
they are in love.

with a few whom you have seen.

854
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,629
Take our case for instance.

855
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,563
From school to college
we have been good friends,

856
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:54,498
without any gender bias.

857
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,832
We are bound only by friendship.

858
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,900
Ok.. What are you studying now?

859
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:01,839
B.A., History.

860
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,069
Which year?

861
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,304
Have finished my First year.

862
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:05,674
You have two more years, right?

863
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:06,349
Yes.

864
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,211
You finish them off and come here.

865
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:11,649
Even then, if you stay as friends,
l will accept your view.

866
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:18,624
Sir, l have a great belief in our friends.

867
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:20,194
We will be friends until the end.

868
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:24,356
l affirm that l will come back the next year
to speak about it, reassuring.

869
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,938
People are either ways.
Like the way you say

870
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:39,206
and the way he does.
We are discussing that.

871
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:44,376
But you were so emotional
and spoke real.

872
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:48,718
l could understand your respect
for the ''Friendship''.

873
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,895
l appreciate you for that.

874
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:54,924
All the best.
- Thank you sir.

875
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:02,538
Why this glutton comes running?

876
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:08,100
Hey our Shobana and that Karthik
are talking to each other.

877
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:11,577
They are all smiles.
They seem to be in love.

878
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:13,406
That's why you shouldn't believe
a Bangalorian girl.

879
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,915
You gave your life for her, right?
See now.

880
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:23,023
Here she comes.,

881
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:25,717
Don't ask her about this..
Let's see what she says..

882
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:30,765
Sorry. lt got late in the library.
Are you waiting for me?

883
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,101
Sorry..sorry.

884
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:37,940
Why are you so silent?

885
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:45,213
What's the Matter?
Tell me. l am hungry.

886
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:49,249
Are you telling the truth?

887
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:51,546
lf not, l will kill you.

888
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:52,687
l Swear.

889
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:54,083
Why do you murmur?

890
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:56,885
l'm asking you Straight away..
why do you do this?

891
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:57,583
Do what?

892
00:49:57,794 --> 00:50:00,558
You have fallen in love with that guy
whom we had protected you from.

893
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:01,560
What do you mean?

894
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:03,494
Aren't you in love with our senior Karthik?

895
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:05,058
Who said sir?

896
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:09,261
l saw you speaking to him in the library.

897
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,608
How could l tell you about that joke?

898
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:15,739
lnitially, l was afraid of him.

899
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:19,279
Later l was sort of laughing
at his behaviors.

900
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:20,948
This is what had happened.

901
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:25,249
When we were rallying for
anti-tobacco campaign.

902
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:29,287
<i>l felt like some one was</i>
<i>following me.</i>

903
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:32,189
<i>Say no to Smoking.</i>
<i>Smoke is our Foe.</i>

904
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:35,625
<i>When l was looking to find him</i>
<i>out he turned his face.</i>

905
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:38,701
<i>He did that again.</i>

906
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:41,936
<i>l was waiting to find out</i>
<i>such a daring nut.</i>

907
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:44,237
<i>lt was the senior who ragged me.</i>

908
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:47,774
<i>l was laughing.</i>

909
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:49,134
<i>Then what happened?</i>

910
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:50,938
<i>l thought of telling you. But...</i>

911
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:51,944
<i>Why didn't you tell us?</i>

912
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:55,380
<i>As l had seen you guys beating</i>
<i>some one in the theatre,</i>

913
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:57,109
<i>l was afraid to tell you.</i>

914
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:01,523
<i>l didn't see him for a while.</i>

915
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:05,789
<i>Then one day he came before</i>
<i>me in a strange look.</i>

916
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:07,721
<i>What a growth?</i>

917
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,327
<i>l understood his intentions.</i>

918
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:14,703
<i>He didn't turn up then.</i>

919
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:15,803
<i>When l was a bit relieved</i>

920
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:19,806
<i>he stood before me at the library</i>
<i>and started talking.</i>

921
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:27,909
Sorry. l behaved so badly,
on the other day.

922
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:31,053
When the friends were around
l got carried away.

923
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,279
So l wanted to apologize.

924
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,355
lt's ok. l had forgotten long before.

925
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:36,924

Oh. Please go.

<i>into a comedian.</i>

- Oh sorry. Shobana, sorry.

935
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,787
l will not fall in love in this birth.

936
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:12,621

without your knowledge, enough?

l saw him the way he
raised his brows.

944
00:53:03,046 --> 00:53:06,174
Why does he go around showing
rainbows off his brows?

945

Everyone is giggling now.

948
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:19,785

Don't laugh.

950
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:25,159
Leave it, Kayal.
She is laughing at the fun behind.

989
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:24,903
He has kept a greeting card
in my bag.

990
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,234
Show it.
- Fool.

What does he mean?
''Love'' or ''Friend''?

994

He is ''Loving''.
Don't you see the underline?

You didn't listen.

She has started lecturing.

1002
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,093
This has come to the level
of a 'Greeting Card'.

1003
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,929
Sooner will it grow to the
stage of a 'love letter'.

Things are still in control.
Come, we will teach him a lesson.

But he was the one who signaled me.

1008
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,774
And told me that he will
keep it inside my bag.

1009

Then what? Let's go.

1010

break his face.

No. lets leave him.

You don't have to ask him.
We will see to it.

Please let's forgive him.

Ok with you? You go, Muthu.

<i>ls it right or it isn't?</i>

1195
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:17,591
<i>My mind knows not to</i>
<i>explain this feeling...</i>

1196
01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:25,256
<i>ls it right or it isn't?</i>

1197
01:13:25,467 --> 01:13:27,264
<i>ls it a boon or a trap?</i>

1198
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:29,437
<i>My age knows not to understand</i>
<i>this relationship.</i>

1199
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:37,441
<i>ls love a boon or a trap?</i>

1200
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:45,445
<i>For the past 3 days l was</i>
<i>thinking about something.</i>

1201
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:47,952
<i>l don't know how to tell you.</i>

1202
01:13:48,157 --> 01:13:48,623
<i>What?</i>

1203
01:13:48,824 --> 01:13:51,622
<i>We are moving with the boys with</i>
<i>true friendship, right? - Yes.</i>

1204
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:54,295
They are also moving with us
in the same way.

1205
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:57,465
<i>But to some, this seems to be wrong.</i>

1206
01:13:57,666 --> 01:13:58,963
<i>l want our selves to change</i>
<i>that which goes wrong.</i>

1207
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:00,965
<i>l don't understand.</i>

1208
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:05,630
When we are together with friends,
we can have fun & laugh.

1209
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:08,469
<i>Having fun & laughing</i>
<i>with a person is different. Right?</i>

1210
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:10,978
l don't know how?

1211
01:14:11,346 --> 01:14:12,973
Let me be straight.

1212
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:15,650
The way yourself and Muthu
are getting along

1213
01:14:15,851 --> 01:14:17,648
and the way you take him
for a pillion ride,

1214
01:14:17,853 --> 01:14:20,822
But the world around is not ready to see
that as an instance of friendship.

1215
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:22,320
lt does see the wrong and speak ill.

1216
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:26,987
Why should we behave in such a way?

1217
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:31,496
l want you to change, Shobana.
Hope you understood now.

1218
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:50,684
<i>The way yourself & Muthu are</i>
<i>getting along and the</i>

1219

<i>l want you to change, Shobana.</i>

1223
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:15,137
<i>Just a minute. Wait.. Come carefully.</i>

1224
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:31,089
The Vehicle can come back.

1225
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:45,969
<i>Pandy, why are you doing like this?</i>

1226
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:47,664
<i>Sir.</i>
<i>- Do it properly.</i>

1227
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:53,875
<i>Come on. Move faster.</i>

1228
01:16:18,473 --> 01:16:20,498
<i>Hello. - This is Kayal.</i>
<i>Have you come to college?</i>

1229
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:22,438
Yes. l came here 30 mins. ago.

1230
01:16:22,644 --> 01:16:23,303
<i>Don't scold me.</i>

1231
01:16:23,512 --> 01:16:25,343
<i>Had some works at home.</i>
<i>So l couldn't come.</i>

1232
01:16:25,547 --> 01:16:28,607
lt's all right. l will leave.

1233
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:34,683
<i>Hello.</i>

1234
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:36,624
What?

1235
01:16:36,825 --> 01:16:38,349
The coach had called you.

1236
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:43,724
Sir, She has come.

1237
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:45,491
Come.

1238
01:16:46,168 --> 01:16:47,601
Sir, Muthu is your friend, right?

1239
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:48,531
Yes sir.

1240
01:16:48,737 --> 01:16:50,671
He hasn't been to the grounds
for the past 3 or 4 days.

1241
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:52,505
l don't know why?

1242
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:54,264
We have a meet in Trichy,
the next week.

1243
01:16:54,476 --> 01:16:55,807
Could you ask him to be here?

1244
01:16:56,144 --> 01:16:59,671
These boys don't know
where his home is. Do you?

1245
01:17:00,415 --> 01:17:01,313
No sir

1246
01:17:01,516 --> 01:17:02,210

1247
01:17:02,417 --> 01:17:03,975
But l can ask for his home
and will inform?

1248
01:17:04,186 --> 01:17:06,882
You don't mind, right?
- No sir.

1249
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:09,216
Ok. His future depends on this meet.

1250
01:17:09,424 --> 01:17:12,018
Don't forget to inform him.
- Ok.

1251
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:06,341
Where is Muthu's house?

1252
01:18:06,548 --> 01:18:07,913
His home is around there.

1253
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:10,411
His father and daughter
are working here.

1254
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:15,690
Hey, Selvi.
- What is it, sister?

1255
01:18:15,891 --> 01:18:18,655
<i>Some one has come to meet</i>
<i>your brother. Come up.</i>

1256
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:22,091
Coming. Dad, l will just be back.
- Quickly.

1257
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:38,236
Have you come in search of my brother?
- Yes.

1258
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:39,708
Come home.
We will meet him.

1259
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:45,384
Come and sit. Come on.
- No. lt's all right.

1260
01:18:52,961 --> 01:18:53,950
Good morning sir.

1261
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:02,127
This is our home. Come in.

1262
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:08,872
Brother!

1263
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:14,909
He isn't here.
Must have been to college.

1264
01:19:15,117 --> 01:19:17,381
l looked for him there.
He hasn't been to college.

1265
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:19,247
Then l don't know, where?

1266
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:21,946
Come in.- lt's all right.

1267
01:19:22,157 --> 01:19:24,489
Do you want to take some drink?
- No. Thanks.

1268
01:19:24,693 --> 01:19:26,058
Have some coffee.

1269
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:28,357
At least, could you come in?

1270
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:32,923
Come in, please.

1271
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:33,999
l will go & get something.

1272
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:35,999
Get me some water.
That will do.

1273
01:19:50,886 --> 01:19:52,114
She is our mom.

1274
01:19:54,356 --> 01:19:55,288
She had died.

1275
01:19:57,626 --> 01:20:00,094
Fell down from a lorry.

1276
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:06,634
Aren't you studying?

1277
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:08,634
l did study.

1278
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:11,598
For my brother to continue his studies,
dad stopped my studies.

1279
01:20:29,591 --> 01:20:31,286
Ok, let me leave.

1280
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,893
Ask your brother to come to
the grounds, tomorrow.- Ok.

1281
01:20:56,284 --> 01:20:57,444
Who are you, sister?

1282
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:02,054

- Ok.

1283
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,035
l'm leaving.
- Ok.

1284
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:52,468
Where have you gone?

1285
01:21:52,674 --> 01:21:55,643
Some one called Shobana
came in search of you.

1286
01:21:56,011 --> 01:21:57,137
When?
- Just now.

1287
01:21:57,345 --> 01:21:58,835

01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:08,783
Who are they, granny?

1291
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:13,011
He was the District Magistrate, Ramanujam.

1292
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:16,186
He?

1293
01:23:16,925 --> 01:23:20,053
Srinivasan. Was a high court Judge.
Your great grand father.

1294
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:24,630
Who was he?
- He was l.G. of Police. Rangarajan.

1295
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:29,665
And he?

1296
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:31,261
What happened to you?

1297
01:23:31,473 --> 01:23:34,465
He was your grandfather.
ln his young age.

1298
01:24:07,142 --> 01:24:10,270
l came home yesterday to insist
you to be in the grounds.

1299
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:15,446
Having seen your father, sister and
the world you are in now,

1300
01:24:16,117 --> 01:24:21,384
l understood that you are studying
amidst your most difficult situation.

1301
01:24:24,559 --> 01:24:27,995
lt isn't a great thing if l study.

1302
01:24:28,496 --> 01:24:32,364
Because my father grandfather and their
entire generations are well educated.

1303
01:24:33,001 --> 01:24:39,406
But people like you who are coming from
a struggling family should develop.

1304
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:43,604
For that you should win.

1305
01:24:44,646 --> 01:24:47,410
Not only in this meet
but in your life too.

1306
01:24:49,017 --> 01:24:51,383
l don't know why haven't you
been to the grounds?

1307
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:55,046
What ever it may be just
throw that out of your mind.

1308
01:24:57,492 --> 01:24:59,016
Rather, what you should have in
your mind now is your

1309
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:05,328
father and the sister who had to
forego her studies for your sake.

1310
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:06,667
lf you have this thought in mind.

1311
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:09,869
You will win, Muthu.

1312
01:25:58,052 --> 01:26:00,316
Hey, listen to me.
Don't go there.

You have groomed him so well.

1327

Muthu, call your friends in.

1328
01:27:39,654 --> 01:27:40,552

Good morning, Sir.
- ls it so ? Good morning.

1333
01:27:53,234 --> 01:27:55,168
There is another important aspect
to it other than the

1334
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:56,962
practice l give and
his intrinsic talent.

1335
01:27:57,171 --> 01:27:59,571
That applause and motivation are
so crucial for a sportsman.

1336
01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:02,639
We all know pretty well that
no other game than cricket

1337
01:28:02,844 --> 01:28:04,141
has a massive audience turn out.

1338
01:28:04,345 --> 01:28:05,676
They have made it that way.

1339
01:28:06,414 --> 01:28:08,575
His friends have spent their
own money to come to.

1340
01:28:08,783 --> 01:28:10,648
Trichy and to wish him success.

1341
01:28:10,852 --> 01:28:14,583

with their support till the very end.

01:28:14,789 --> 01:28:15,585
ls it so?

1343
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:16,882
l called them here for that reason.

1344

friends in the college.

Why to marry in a hurry?

He is not feeling well too.
He wants to see me married.

Whats the matter?

Hey, what do you mean?
l didn't do it, Shobana.

1406
01:32:53,367 --> 01:32:55,028
Why are you lying?
She will think bad about me.

1407
01:32:55,236 --> 01:32:59,036
What's there to think bad
about a friend? Don't be tensed.

1408
01:32:59,907 --> 01:33:02,102
Shobana sings very well.

We were searching for you.

1433

Did anyone say anything to you?

1434
01:36:05,426 --> 01:36:07,587
No. l couldn't stay because
of head ache.

1435
01:36:09,230 --> 01:36:13,929

Nothing beyond that.

You had wanted us not to.
But you are laughing.

Why is this whisper?

1491
01:40:03,564 --> 01:40:07,261
No Kayal, Adhilakshmi is about
to dance for a pop number.

1492
01:40:07,468 --> 01:40:10,562
She wanted us not to reveal it
before she appears on stage.

1493
01:40:10,771 --> 01:40:13,171
This girl had laughed and
let the cat out of the bag.

1494
01:40:15,476 --> 01:40:16,204
Yes.

1495
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:17,468
Why didn't you tell me?

1496
01:40:17,678 --> 01:40:19,145
She thought that you would scold,
if she dances.

1497
01:40:19,346 --> 01:40:20,608
Why would l scold?

1498
01:40:21,181 --> 01:40:23,775
<i>Ok. ls that the reason for</i>
<i>your sudden absconding?</i>

We are used to take the same
stuff that we buy for all?

1516

Come, lets go.

Look at Ayyanar.

lce cream. Ten.

1521
01:43:11,952 --> 01:43:13,146
Do you want special or ordinary?

Why do you take this too?

1531

You will always support her.
Why do you scold her today?

1532
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:54,527
Take this, Muthu.

1533
01:43:59,099 --> 01:44:00,794
Ok. Come. Let's go and get another.

You can. l don't want to.

Hello, which is the way to rest room?

1547
01:45:19,046 --> 01:45:20,536
This side is for the ladies
and that for the Gents.

1548
01:45:20,747 --> 01:45:22,476
How to go there?

1549
01:45:22,683 --> 01:45:23,581
This way.

1550
01:45:23,784 --> 01:45:25,513
How can l go like this?

1551
01:45:25,819 --> 01:45:27,184
<i>l want you to tell me</i>
<i>without feeling shameful.</i>

1552
01:45:27,454 --> 01:45:28,250
You idiot. Rascal.

1553
01:45:28,455 --> 01:45:29,444
'ldiot'? Where is it?

1554
01:45:29,656 --> 01:45:31,123
What is it, Shobana?
- Nothing.

1555
01:45:31,325 --> 01:45:33,350
Hey, what is it
l'm asking you.

1556
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:34,026
Kayal, leave it.

1557
01:45:34,227 --> 01:45:35,091
What do you say?
Who are you scolding?

1558
01:45:35,295 --> 01:45:38,458
What did you say?
Ask him to say it to me.

1559
01:45:38,665 --> 01:45:40,189
You are going too far.

1560
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:41,264
Touch me, if you are dare enough.

1561
01:45:41,468 --> 01:45:43,595
l will beat you.
- Do it if you are really a man?

1562
01:45:43,804 --> 01:45:44,463
Shobana, call our boys.

1563
01:45:44,671 --> 01:45:45,865
You go and call anyone you wish.

1564
01:45:46,073 --> 01:45:47,040
Hey, what is it?

1565
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:48,070
Please. Come here, Kayal.

1566
01:45:48,275 --> 01:45:50,539
Why are you afraid?
Call our boys.

1567
01:45:55,248 --> 01:45:55,805
l say, you call our boys first.

1568
01:45:56,016 --> 01:45:56,482
Please...leave it, Kayal.

1569
01:45:56,683 --> 01:45:57,707
Hey, tell me what?

1570
01:45:57,918 --> 01:45:58,384
You are going too far.

1571
01:45:58,585 --> 01:45:59,779
Take off your hands from the shirt.

1572
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:00,877
<i>You can go.</i>

1573
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:02,055
Wait.

1574
01:46:02,756 --> 01:46:05,520
Shobana, why aren't you
allowing me to tell them.

1575
01:46:05,826 --> 01:46:08,056
Did you do any wrong?
Then, why should you be afraid?

1576
01:46:08,328 --> 01:46:09,124
There is no point in telling you.

1577
01:46:09,329 --> 01:46:09,954
l will talk to them, myself.

1578
01:46:10,163 --> 01:46:13,929
Don't make it a big issue,
by telling them.

1579
01:46:14,134 --> 01:46:15,726
Why are you so fearful?

1580
01:46:17,104 --> 01:46:19,163
Let's not kill their happiness.

1581
01:46:21,608 --> 01:46:23,075
You will not understand, Shobana.

1582
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:36,421
Are you a girl to keep
weeping like this?

1583
01:46:40,861 --> 01:46:41,828
What happened?

1584
01:46:44,331 --> 01:46:44,956
Why are you looking pale?

1585
01:46:54,374 --> 01:46:55,398
Show me who is he?

1586
01:46:58,378 --> 01:46:58,867
Where is they?

1587
01:46:59,079 --> 01:46:59,545
Muthu.

1588
01:46:59,746 --> 01:47:01,145
<i>That girl who shouted at you</i>
<i>is coming with more boys.</i>

1589
01:47:01,348 --> 01:47:02,372
Those guys who are coming.

1590

<i>Kamatchi- Ayyanaar- Albert</i>
<i>- All of you come, quickly.</i>

1591
01:47:09,089 --> 01:47:09,555
Muthu, no.

1592
01:47:09,756 --> 01:47:10,848
Who played a tussle with
our college girls?

1593
01:47:11,057 --> 01:47:11,546
We did so.

1594
01:47:11,758 --> 01:47:13,248
Tell me, who is the one?
- lt is we.

1595
01:47:17,330 --> 01:47:20,458
<i>Albert and Ayyanar, come fast.</i>

<i>Stop them Ramesh.</i>

<i>Don't leave him.</i>

1599
01:48:02,976 --> 01:48:08,676
Oh. lt's so Painful.

1600

<i>lts paining.</i>

1601
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:16,245
l wanted you to avoid the problem
and told you repeatedly.

1602
01:48:16,456 --> 01:48:18,356
You didn't listen.

1603
01:48:19,359 --> 01:48:21,190
See, what has happened
because of your hastiness.

1604
01:48:22,329 --> 01:48:24,729
No, Shobana. l didn't think that
this would happen.

1605
01:48:25,131 --> 01:48:27,361
He spoke ill of you...

1606
01:48:27,567 --> 01:48:29,626
Did he say anything about you?
He was telling about me

1607
01:48:29,836 --> 01:48:31,531
and let the scoundrels do it.

1608
01:48:31,738 --> 01:48:33,968
l was keeping cool and
why did you get angry?

1609
01:48:35,742 --> 01:48:38,438
Aren't you my friend?

1610
01:48:39,646 --> 01:48:44,015
lf anything happens to his legs,
as a friend can you give yours?

1611
01:48:44,651 --> 01:48:48,052
Don't talk foolishly about
friendship for every damn thing.

1612
01:49:03,436 --> 01:49:06,337
Muthu, how are you feeling now?

1613
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:07,734
All right, Shobana.

1614
01:49:07,941 --> 01:49:09,238
Doctor, there isn't any complication
with his leg, right?

1615
01:49:09,442 --> 01:49:10,602
lts ok. Nothing.

1616
01:49:10,810 --> 01:49:12,072
He is a sportsman that's why..

1617
01:49:12,279 --> 01:49:14,474
Don't worry. He has got a sprain.

1618
01:49:14,681 --> 01:49:16,308
l have dressed it up.
lt will be all right in a day or two.

1619
01:49:16,516 --> 01:49:17,448
Thank you, Doctor.

1620
01:49:17,651 --> 01:49:19,585
All right. Take him carefully.
- Thank you very much.

1621
01:49:20,854 --> 01:49:24,654
Forgive me, Muthu.
l'm responsible for all this.

1622
01:49:24,858 --> 01:49:25,825
Why're you crying, Kayal?

1623
01:49:26,026 --> 01:49:28,859
There is a clash between
Kayal and Shobana.

1624
01:49:30,130 --> 01:49:31,324
What Shobana?

1625
01:49:33,099 --> 01:49:35,260
Kayal.. Kayal.. Kayal..

1626
01:49:37,871 --> 01:49:39,429
Why were you so rude?

1627
01:49:40,874 --> 01:49:42,000
Hey, Kayal.

1628
01:50:03,496 --> 01:50:06,522
Kayal, Move a bit.

1629
01:50:16,743 --> 01:50:18,233
What ?
- Give.

1630
01:50:20,447 --> 01:50:21,436

<i>See, we are planning for a tour</i>
<i>from the History Department.</i>

Hey, Silent.. silent..

1634
01:50:54,147 --> 01:50:55,637
Sir, shall we go to Kashmir?

1635
01:50:55,849 --> 01:50:57,316
The budget will not permit.
Shall we go to Ooty?

1636
01:50:57,517 --> 01:50:58,541
Shall we go to Kodai?

1637
01:50:58,752 --> 01:51:00,413
This isn't a tour that you
go out as you wish.

1638
01:51:00,620 --> 01:51:02,781
This is an educational tour.

1639
01:51:02,989 --> 01:51:04,513
<i>You should keep that in mind.</i>

1640
01:51:04,991 --> 01:51:10,793

<i>a place of historic importance.</i>

1641

<i>Have you taken note of it?</i>

1642
01:51:12,265 --> 01:51:15,132
We will start from here to Chennai

1643

<i>to see the Pallava architecture</i>
<i>in the near by Mahabalipuram.</i>

1644

From there we can move
to Thirupathi.

1645
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:21,437
So as to tonsure there, sir?

1646
01:51:24,144 --> 01:51:27,341
We will visit fort Chandragiri
near Thirupathi

1647
01:51:27,547 --> 01:51:30,243
and will leave for Vellore to visit
the great Vellore fort.

1648
01:51:30,450 --> 01:51:32,816
From there we will return
back home in three days.

1649
01:51:33,019 --> 01:51:35,010
What sort of a tour is this?
Sir, we find it a bore.

1650
01:51:35,221 --> 01:51:36,017
We don't want to come.

1651
01:51:36,222 --> 01:51:39,055
l will not lose anything

1652
01:51:39,259 --> 01:51:40,157
What are you saying, sir?

1653
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:42,328
Yes. You have already remitted
a fee for the tour

1654
01:51:42,529 --> 01:51:44,554
along with your college fees.

1655
01:51:44,764 --> 01:51:47,631
Now you are going to pay only
for the food and accommodation.

1656
01:51:48,435 --> 01:51:49,902
lf you don't turn up,
you will be at loss.

1657
01:51:50,103 --> 01:51:51,934

1658
01:51:52,138 --> 01:51:53,901

Why are you sitting dumb?

Are we going to the tour or not?

1663
01:52:18,898 --> 01:52:19,922
Hey, what do you say?

1664
01:52:20,133 --> 01:52:22,601
Why are you shouting at me?
Ask them.

1665
01:52:22,802 --> 01:52:24,929
Hey, Shobana. Look, are you coming
for the tour or not?

1666
01:52:25,505 --> 01:52:27,234
lf every one is coming, l will too.

1667
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:28,998
What are you saying, Kayal?

1668
01:52:38,051 --> 01:52:40,144
l was angry and spoke something,
unknowingly.

1669
01:52:40,353 --> 01:52:42,719
Why doesn't she understand?
Why is she not speaking to me?

1670
01:52:46,659 --> 01:52:50,686
Every one's jolly good mood got
spoiled because of me.

1671
01:52:50,897 --> 01:52:51,886
<i>Don't speak that way.</i>

She isn't coming because of me.

We will speak to her.

1676
01:53:01,608 --> 01:53:02,836
She will definitely come to
the tour with us.

1677
01:53:03,042 --> 01:53:04,236
You don't have to cry, Shobana.

1678
01:53:04,511 --> 01:53:06,638
While moving along bonded
as one family,

1679
01:53:06,846 --> 01:53:08,370

<i>- Hey, ask him to speak?</i>

Why have you come this far to work?

1833

1857
02:07:49,328 --> 02:07:51,296
What do you mean?
What's wrong with you?

1858
02:07:54,333 --> 02:07:57,791
l want to tell you every thing in my mind.

1859
02:07:58,170 --> 02:08:01,298
Hey, Shobana, stop crying.
lt's all right tell me.

1860
02:08:02,508 --> 02:08:03,975
You had told me the other day, right?

1861
02:08:04,176 --> 02:08:06,406
What did l say and when?

1862
02:08:07,913 --> 02:08:13,078
That morning, you had told me
about getting along with Muthu.

1863
02:08:33,372 --> 02:08:36,170
Kayal, l am telling you without
a sense of shame.

1864
02:08:36,875 --> 02:08:41,107
l have slowly given my heart to Muthu.

1865
02:08:42,548 --> 02:08:44,675
l was yearning to tell you and
really wasn't able to.

1866
02:08:45,150 --> 02:08:48,176
Because of it l had behaved with such
anger towards you & Aadhilakshmi.

1867
02:08:49,888 --> 02:08:52,516
l don't want to conceal
anything anymore.

1868
02:08:53,826 --> 02:08:57,523
l couldn't live up to your belief,

1869
02:08:58,397 --> 02:09:02,128
because Muthu is my life
and l love him so dear.

1870
02:09:02,735 --> 02:09:05,203
l never can forget him.

1871
02:09:10,743 --> 02:09:12,870
What are you saying?
- Yes.

1872
02:09:13,078 --> 02:09:14,204
Salima, will this be true?

1873
02:09:14,413 --> 02:09:16,881
Hey, don't bluff without knowing it for sure.
- l swear l heard it.

1874
02:09:17,082 --> 02:09:20,711
ls this the reason for him to go
all along to a Brahmin hotel?

1875
02:09:20,919 --> 02:09:25,219
Let's not ask them a word.
Let themselves admit.

1876
02:09:26,191 --> 02:09:28,159
l don't know what to say, Shobana.

1877
02:09:31,597 --> 02:09:35,897
l'm not sure as to whether
l should be happy or sad.

1878
02:09:36,201 --> 02:09:38,169
Because such was the
condition in which l grew.

1879
02:09:39,605 --> 02:09:40,731
My parents had always advised us in this way.

1880
02:09:41,006 --> 02:09:43,236
''There are five daughters
in our family.

1881
02:09:43,942 --> 02:09:46,740
You should behave with
undaunted discipline.

1882
02:09:47,446 --> 02:09:51,177
Our respect stands above our food.

1883
02:09:51,617 --> 02:09:53,744
To protect our respect is
in your hands.

1884
02:09:54,286 --> 02:09:57,653
lf you take the wrong path of love
or the like you will find us die''.

1885
02:09:58,290 --> 02:10:05,093
This is how my parents kept on saying
at every stage of our growing.

1886
02:10:06,231 --> 02:10:13,103
Because of such grooming l was
so dumb to understand a real love.

1887
02:10:14,473 --> 02:10:18,432
But l will never stand in the
way of your happiness.

1888
02:10:19,912 --> 02:10:23,439
Your happiness is so very precious
to me than my ego.

1889
02:10:24,650 --> 02:10:27,448
l want you and Muthu to live longer.

1890
02:10:33,225 --> 02:10:34,692
Why are they closing down the shops?

1891
02:10:35,227 --> 02:10:39,857
Some former Minister has been arrested now
on the grounds of corruption charges.

1892
02:10:40,232 --> 02:10:42,700
His party men are thick in an agitation
to shut down the shops.

1893
02:10:42,901 --> 02:10:44,368
They are telling this in the TV news.

1894
02:10:48,407 --> 02:10:51,535
This is the hometown of the Minister.
So the riot is at its peak here.

1895
02:10:51,743 --> 02:10:53,040
Move away. l will have to shut down.

1896
02:10:53,245 --> 02:10:54,269
Sir, what are we to do sir?

1897
02:10:54,847 --> 02:10:57,213
Wait. l will talk to the principal.
Let's see what he has to say on this.

1898
02:11:01,253 --> 02:11:02,880
ls it? Where are you now?

1899
02:11:03,088 --> 02:11:06,216
Around Chittoor in a hotel.
We all have eaten.

1900
02:11:06,425 --> 02:11:07,153
Then do one thing.

1901
02:11:07,526 --> 02:11:09,551
lf there is a police station around,
or a District Collector's Office

1902
02:11:09,761 --> 02:11:13,390
<i>or any Government Office around,</i>
<i>go there right away and stay there.</i>

1903
02:11:13,599 --> 02:11:15,567
When things are normal
you can leave for Vellore.

1904
02:11:15,767 --> 02:11:17,564
Don't worry, Mr. Shivakumar.
- Ok, Sir.

1905
02:11:19,104 --> 02:11:22,232
Hey get into the bus immediately.
Quick.

1906
02:11:28,013 --> 02:11:28,570
What do you have?

1907
02:11:28,780 --> 02:11:30,338
Curd rice and tamarind rice.
- How much?

1908
02:11:30,549 --> 02:11:31,413
Ten rupees.

1909
02:11:31,750 --> 02:11:33,741
lf you want vegetarian food,
you should have informed me.

1910
02:11:34,987 --> 02:11:36,420
l would have arranged it for.

1911
02:11:38,690 --> 02:11:40,749
lf every one is behaving to their whims
l don't know what they mean?

1912
02:11:41,793 --> 02:11:42,919
Don't you understand the situation?

1913
02:11:43,128 --> 02:11:44,755
Why is our Professor shouting?

1914
02:11:44,963 --> 02:11:45,930
There is a wide spread
agitation in town.

1915
02:11:46,131 --> 02:11:48,292
They have closed down the
shops every where.

1916
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:02,947
See, it's getting late.

1917
02:12:03,148 --> 02:12:06,208
Any two of you should wait
here and pick him up.

1918
02:12:06,418 --> 02:12:09,444
We will wait in the Collector's Office which is
just three kilometers away from here.

1919
02:12:09,655 --> 02:12:11,122
Look out for it and come, safely.

1920
02:12:11,823 --> 02:12:13,620
Ramesh, we will stay.
- Okay.

1921
02:12:13,992 --> 02:12:14,959
Ok. Sir, you could leave.

1922
02:12:15,160 --> 02:12:16,627
Others get in. We can start.

1923
02:12:16,828 --> 02:12:18,796
Wait for Muthu and come with him.
Ramesh, carefully. Ok.

1924
02:12:18,997 --> 02:12:19,964
Get in.

1925
02:12:23,502 --> 02:12:24,469
<i>Sir, let's wait for another</i>
<i>ten minutes, please.</i>

1926
02:12:24,670 --> 02:12:26,968
<i>They are telling that they will</i>
<i>pick him up, right ? Get in.</i>

1927
02:12:27,372 --> 02:12:50,059
<i>AYNGARAN DVD.</i>

1928
02:12:50,362 --> 02:12:51,829
To our leader.

1929
02:13:02,374 --> 02:13:03,841
Why only two of you are here?
Where is the bus?

1930
02:13:04,443 --> 02:13:07,674
Hey, a very big riot is underway. To be safe
they've gone to the Collector's Office.

1931
02:13:07,879 --> 02:13:09,346
We will go. lt must be near by.

1932
02:13:11,717 --> 02:13:16,677
<i>Hail our leader.</i>

1933
02:13:16,888 --> 02:13:18,014
<i>Go extreme left.</i>

1934
02:13:18,223 --> 02:13:20,851
<i>Hey stop the bus. Stop it.</i>

1935
02:13:38,910 --> 02:13:40,036
Wait for a minute, sir.

1936
02:13:40,245 --> 02:13:41,439
Who gave you the permission
to run the bus?

1937
02:13:42,014 --> 02:13:44,380
Our leader is now behind the bars.
Why the hell you need a tour?

1938
02:13:44,583 --> 02:13:45,481
Sir, we don't know anything
about that.

1939
02:13:45,684 --> 02:13:47,379
We have come and l will ask
all of them to get down.

1940
02:13:47,586 --> 02:13:50,214
Sir, please.. Sir, just be patient for a while.
Madam, ask all of them to get down.

1941
02:13:50,422 --> 02:13:52,549
Get down girls.
Get down with your baggage.

1942
02:13:52,758 --> 02:13:54,885
Why to talk with him?
Set the bus on fire.

1943
02:13:55,761 --> 02:13:57,786
Why to talk with him?
Set the bus on fire.

1944
02:13:57,996 --> 02:14:02,456
Sir., sir., don't do anything..
Sir., they are college students.

1945
02:14:02,667 --> 02:14:05,397
What damn College?- Just one minute sir.
- l will ask all of them to get down.

1946
02:14:05,604 --> 02:14:11,236
All of you. Come down.
Quickly.

1947
02:14:11,710 --> 02:14:15,407
Get down, quickly.
Nothing at all.

1948
02:14:15,781 --> 02:14:18,909
Get down.
- What happened?

1949
02:14:30,962 --> 02:14:39,768
Quickly, Shobana. Go.
- Shobana. go.. go..

1950
02:14:44,976 --> 02:14:46,944
<i>Shobana.. Alas..</i>

1951
02:14:48,146 --> 02:14:48,942
<i>Go Shobana.</i>

1952
02:14:55,821 --> 02:14:57,789
<i>Get down. Get down.. Hey..</i>
<i>Stop the cycle. Go off.</i>

1953
02:14:57,989 --> 02:14:59,456
Oh, no.

1954
02:15:00,826 --> 02:15:03,954
<i>Salima, don't panic.</i>
<i>Slowly. Keep it slowly.</i>

1955
02:15:04,162 --> 02:15:08,622
Get me some water.
Ask them for water.

1956
02:15:22,180 --> 02:15:23,545
Move.. Move..

1957
02:15:27,853 --> 02:15:31,482
Hey, Ramesh. lt looks like our bus.

1958
02:15:37,529 --> 02:15:40,657
<i>What happened?</i>
<i>What happened.. tell me something.</i>

1959
02:15:40,866 --> 02:15:43,994
<i>All of us are there right?</i>
<i>Ramesh go and check.</i>

1960
02:15:45,370 --> 02:15:47,998
Where are our girls?
- Where is our Shobana?

1961
02:15:53,211 --> 02:15:55,509
<i>What happened?</i>
<i>What happened.. tell me something.</i>

1962
02:15:55,714 --> 02:15:59,514
<i>All of us are there right?</i>
<i>Ramesh go and check.</i>

1963
02:16:01,386 --> 02:16:03,854
<i>Where is Shobana?</i>

1964
02:16:04,589 --> 02:17:32,106
<i>AYNGARAN DVD.</i>

1965
02:17:32,310 --> 02:17:36,679
Those sinners have given the girls
to flames and killed them alive.

1966
02:17:41,820 --> 02:17:46,780
How will their parents soul bleed?

1967
02:18:10,448 --> 02:18:13,906
At last these students came to my shop.

1968
02:18:21,359 --> 02:18:23,327
lt has been five or six years
since it happened.

1969
02:18:24,529 --> 02:18:27,327
They come here every year
to pay their tributes.

1970
02:18:29,868 --> 02:18:39,266
<i>We're on to victory..</i>
<i>We're on to victory one day.</i>

1971
02:18:39,477 --> 02:18:43,846
<i>Oh, deep in my heart, l do believe.</i>

1972
02:18:44,049 --> 02:18:48,679
<i>We're on to victory some day.</i>

1973
02:18:48,887 --> 02:18:53,347
<i>We're on to victory some day.</i>

1974
02:18:53,558 --> 02:18:58,518
<i>We're on to victory some day.</i>

1975
02:18:58,730 --> 02:19:08,037
<i>We are not afraid..we are not afraid..</i>
<i>We are not afraid today.</i>

1976
02:19:08,340 --> 02:19:12,709
<i>Oh, deep in my heart,</i>
<i>l do believe.</i>

1977
02:19:12,911 --> 02:19:21,376
<i>We're on to victory some day.</i>

1978
02:19:21,586 --> 02:19:26,046
<i>We'll walk hand in hand,</i>
<i>we'll walk hand in hand.</i>

1979
02:19:26,257 --> 02:19:30,887
<i>We'll walk hand in hand some day.</i>

1980
02:19:31,162 --> 02:19:35,565
<i>Oh, deep in my heart,</i>
<i>l do believe.</i>

1981
02:19:35,767 --> 02:19:40,898
<i>We're on to victory some day.</i>

1982
02:19:43,708 --> 02:19:48,077
<i>We shall live in peace,</i>
<i>we shall live in peace.</i>

1983
02:19:48,480 --> 02:19:53,179
<i>We shall live in peace some day.</i>

1984
02:19:53,351 --> 02:20:13,296
<i>Oh, deep in my heart, l do believe</i>
<i>We're on to victory so.</i>
