1
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,917
- Is there no one at home?
- Grandma is. She's hard of hearing.

2
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,417
Don't! That is her room. This is mine!

3
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,750
- Good night!
- Hush!

4
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:06,250
I will be right back.

5
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,042
Chetan Bhagat!

6
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:17,083
Oh!

7
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,708
<i>The Perks of Being a Wallflower!</i>
You read it?

8
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:23,250
I read the book. Watched the film.
And I am one!

9
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,917
What are you? A wallflower or a perk?

10
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,792
You are a wallflower, aren't you?

11
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:34,250
You find yourself a corner.
Hear and see everything

12
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,125
but never do anything.
I need to do something.

13
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:40,500
You read <i>Sophie Kinsella</i>?

14
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,125
I tried but couldn't finish.

15
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,250
Why?

16
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:49,208
It's too difficult
Natasha asked me to read it.

17
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:51,833
You understood Wallflower
and not Kinsella?

18
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,167
That was an easy read.

19
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,750
- A wallflower or a fly, it's the same.
- Wow!

20
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,042
You are smart!

21
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:34,583
What's wrong? Is this your first time?

22
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,792
- Really?
- Yes.

23
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,375
Let me teach you.

24
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:57,125
Tea?

25
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,833
What happened last night...

26
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,792
was good, right?

27
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,250
- Yes.
- Yes.

28
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:21,083
It was natural, right?

29
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,917
Don't ruin it by talking about it.

30
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,958
Don't talk about it.

31
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,292
I shouldn't have.

32
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:38,208
- You won't fall in love, right?
- No.

33
00:06:38,292 --> 00:06:40,333
Don't overthink it.

34
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:43,417
- Okay.
- All right?

35
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:55,542
Mihir told me that guys

36
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,500
tend to get emotional after sex

37
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,792
and they fall in love.

38
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:09,500
They become possessive.

39
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,167
Sure.

40
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,625
What is it? Why are you smiling?

41
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,333
Do we share a secret?

42
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:58,833
Do we?

43
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,167
I was 26

44
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,500
when I got married to Mihir.

45
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:06,750
He was 12 years older than me.

46
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,083
I had never dated anyone.

47
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,167
But Mihir had dated many girls.

48
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:21,917
So marrying a much older guy
was an adventure for me.

49
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,208
My parents were against it.

50
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:27,917
He had so many stories to share!
Like he went somewhere,

51
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,125
met a girl there,
and they started talking.

52
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:36,875
His stories were straight out of a movie.

53
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,875
I didn't have any of that.

54
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:44,250
We talked and he made me understand

55
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:48,417
that I will resent him

56
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,042
if I did not live my life on my terms.

57
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:55,125
He urged me to examine my life.

58
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:01,500
She had a lover, Imroze,
who was younger than her.

59
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,542
Draupadi lived with five Pandavas.

60
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,708
She loved them and perhaps,
they loved her too.

61
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,875
They did not fight over her.

62
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:21,333
I'm married and I cannot be
with anyone else.

63
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:23,625
What if I fantasize about someone?

64
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:24,708
It's not okay.

65
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:27,667
How can you expect so much from a person?

66
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:33,167
You want him to be your best friend,
your lover and your wildest fantasy.

67
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:43,375
What do I do?

68
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:52,958
It's good that they are finally
speaking out.

69
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:54,625
But how can they prove it?

70
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,208
People play the victim card for publicity.

71
00:09:57,292 --> 00:09:58,500
Did you read this?

72
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:05,583
The husband divorced her
as soon as he learned of it.

73
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:08,583
Things like that happen there often.

74
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:11,958
But it's wrong. It's not okay.

75
00:10:12,042 --> 00:10:14,833
What is the student's age?

76
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,042
- He is 18.
- So he is an adult.

77
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:22,208
- Does that justify it?
- No matter how old he is...

78
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:29,583
- But he is an adult!
- How do you know it was consensual?

79
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,500
His silence means it was not consensual.

80
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,958
- Tejas Bhave?
- Yes.

81
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:40,208
I need to talk to you.

82
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:49,000
Don't you think she is weird?

83
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,500
Listen! How old are you?

84
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:55,625
Why?

85
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,500
- Just tell me your age!
- 21.

86
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:59,083
- Sure?
- Yes.

87
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:01,333
Does your admission form say that?

88
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,583
- No.
- People often do that.

89
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,042
- I'm not sure.
- Come on!

90
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,833
- Do you have your birth certificate?
- Yes.

91
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:11,042
Get it for me.

92
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,750
Take it from the college office.

93
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:17,875
How can I go and ask for it?
What if they ask me why?

94
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,208
Why do you need it?

95
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:23,583
Listen.

96
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,375
What happened that night

97
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:28,208
was consensual, right?

98
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:29,333
What do you mean?

99
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,083
Did I force you to have sex?

100
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:33,542
No. But...

101
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,833
What?

102
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,542
You made the first move!

103
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,125
Did you say no?

104
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,625
- No.
- Exactly.

105
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,833
So, it was consensual, right?

106
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:49,708
Say it. Say that it was consensual.

107
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,833
What do I say?

108
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:53,083
Say that it was consensual.

109
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:55,250
- What is that word?
- Consensual!

110
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,583
Yes. Say it.

111
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:57,667
It was.

112
00:11:58,042 --> 00:12:01,042
"Whatever happened
between us was consensual."

113
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,042
- Whatever happened between us...
- Yes...

114
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,333
- Was consensual!
- Was consensual.

115
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,208
- Say it in one go.
- The complete statement?

116
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:10,167
- Yes.
- Whatever...

117
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,000
Say this. "Whatever happened between us,"

118
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,833
"Ms. Kalindi, was consensual."

119
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,667
- Whatever...
- "This is Tejas. Ms. Kalindi..."

120
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:19,958
"Whatever happened
between us was consensual."

121
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:23,958
Ms. Kalindi, this is Tejas.
Whatever happened between us...

122
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,625
- Was all...
- That was all consensual!

123
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,083
Now say it properly!

124
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:32,708
Ms. Kalindi, whatever happened
between us was consensual.

125
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,000
- I am Tejas.
- Okay.

126
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:43,250
It's my fault!
They have to hit me if I go home late.

127
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:56,042
Just go home. Shut the door.
Play some nice music.

128
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,750
Wash your hands

129
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,708
Think of Hrithik Roshan
and have a good time.

130
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:11,292
Now look at that girl.
I said masturbation and she hid her face!

131
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,625
- Ms. Kalindi!
- I came by to apologize.

132
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,042
Why?

133
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:20,292
I recorded your statement and scared you.

134
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:24,792
No. I did not understand anything.
What was that word?

135
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,250
Forget it.

136
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:30,000
- Listen, now we're friends, okay?
- Yes.

137
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:34,917
As in real friends...
who share everything.

138
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,625
Okay.

139
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,542
- But without benefits.
- What do you mean?

140
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,625
I mean I have a boyfriend now.

141
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:49,458
- Professor Neeraj!
- Yes.

142
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,750
- The Mathematics professor?
- Yes.

143
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:55,750
- Have you seen his hair?
- Cool, right?

144
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,625
He isn't like the other guys.

145
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,792
He is faithful. Do you know what he says?

146
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,250
Did you know that

147
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,208
penguins are monogamous

148
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:12,583
and that helps them survive
in the extreme cold?

149
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,833
He wants me to be only his.

150
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:29,125
And he doesn't find me weird.
Unlike what your Natasha feels.

151
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:31,833
- My Natasha?
- Yes!

152
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,875
I know everything.

153
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,083
I love Mihir

154
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,167
and I love Tejas too.

155
00:14:56,542 --> 00:15:00,000
If I love Tejas and Neeraj as well...

156
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,000
I will not hold myself back.

157
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:24,333
Where are you?

158
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,542
Where are you?

159
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,500
Where the hell are you?

160
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,583
What happened?

161
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,458
- What happened?
- You tell me!

162
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,750
You said it was urgent.

163
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,125
I took care of it.

164
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,375
- So easily?
- It's not working out with Neeraj.

165
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,792
What happened?

166
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:52,667
I thought he was smart! Intelligent!

167
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:55,250
That he knows everything.

168
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,167
But not chemistry.

169
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:05,792
He doesn't know how to make a move.

170
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:11,917
It took him 17 days, 16 hours
and 32 minutes to say...

171
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,542
I asked him the same question.

172
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,167
Wait!

173
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,250
- Do you have a condom?
- In the drawer next to you.

174
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,875
- Should I wear it?
- No.

175
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:17,833
- What happened?
- Nothing!

176
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,208
What happened?

177
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,542
Found it!

178
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:40,125
- Answer it.
- It's alright.

179
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,000
- Who called?
- I don't know.

180
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:45,375
- Was it Natasha?
- No.

181
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:56,083
So are you guys together?

182
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,125
It's over.

183
00:17:59,292 --> 00:18:00,542
Really?

184
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:07,958
Did you have sex with her yet?

185
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,333
No.

186
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,333
Liar.

187
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,458
Why do you care?

188
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,458
- Don't I share my stories with you?
- Do I ask you to?

189
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:22,458
You just vomit it all out.

190
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,667
What's happening between you and Natasha?

191
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:28,125
Nothing.

192
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:31,625
Now that you
and Professor Neeraj have broken up,

193
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:33,375
should we...

194
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,333
No?

195
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,917
Did you come here to text?

196
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,125
Give me your phone.

197
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,292
Passcode, please.

198
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:15,167
I have forgotten it.

199
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,375
Type the passcode.

200
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,292
See. I don't remember it.

201
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,750
Collect it from the office.

202
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,042
I am leaving.

203
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:43,083
Are you guys studying?

204
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:49,583
You sit with Rahul in the classroom,

205
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,625
with Akash in the cafeteria.

206
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,542
And now, you are with Tejas.

207
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,542
Your parents live in Dubai...

208
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,292
but they send you money, right?

209
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:06,250
Do you live alone?

210
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,000
Why did you do that?

211
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:44,333
Is she your girlfriend?

212
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,458
No.

213
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:49,708
Oh!

214
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,333
Mihir, can you hear me?

215
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:03,500
No one is ever honest with anyone.

216
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:06,292
Even my parents were not honest
with each other!

217
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:09,542
No one is!

218
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:13,375
Although Mihir was with me,
I was feeling guilty.

219
00:23:17,917 --> 00:23:19,917
Why do I feel guilty?

220
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,083
What makes me feel that way?

221
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:27,042
You must love selflessly.

222
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,208
Mihir loves me like that.

223
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:07,750
Nothing!

224
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:40,708
Where are you?

225
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:52,042
- No!
- I know you are dating Natasha.

226
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:53,833
Where are you?

227
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:57,542
Tell me.

228
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,250
You are, aren't you?

229
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,667
Tell me!

230
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:08,125
- Go to sleep. Good night.
- Tell me...

231
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:33,958
Mihir and I...

232
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:42,000
He calls me up and tells me everything.

233
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,542
I'm going to tell the truth too.

234
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:48,167
Something happened between Tejas and me.

235
00:25:48,458 --> 00:25:50,125
We had something special.

236
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:52,000
So we owe this to each other.

237
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:54,958
I told him

238
00:25:55,292 --> 00:25:57,208
about my affair with Neeraj.

239
00:25:57,667 --> 00:26:01,625
I told him everything.

240
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,375
I told him when I got fed up.

241
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:41,208
I cannot be Mihir.

242
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:15,958
But Tejas lied to me
when I asked him about them.

243
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:17,667
He lied to me.

244
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:26,083
I don't like being lied to.

245
00:27:26,292 --> 00:27:27,917
He shouldn't have lied.

246
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:35,167
Tejas!

247
00:28:21,542 --> 00:28:23,042
Tejas?

248
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:24,625
He's inside.

249
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:30,708
Tejas!

250
00:28:34,542 --> 00:28:35,542
Tejas!

251
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:47,542
Open up!

252
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:51,917
Open the door!

253
00:28:54,292 --> 00:28:55,667
Come on!

254
00:28:56,875 --> 00:29:00,500
Tejas. Please open the door!

255
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,167
Are you listening?

256
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:24,750
- Grandma?
- Tejas.

257
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:27,042
Open the door!

258
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:35,375
Who is in there?

259
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:37,917
That crazy girl!

260
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:39,833
She just ran inside.

261
00:29:42,292 --> 00:29:43,750
Open the door!

262
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:09,750
What are you guys up to?

263
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:11,958
- Whose is this?
- I don't know.

264
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:13,125
Whose is this?

265
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:15,000
- I don't know!
- Is it Natasha's?

266
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:16,250
No.

267
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,708
- I'm asking for the last time! Is it hers?
- How can it be hers?

268
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:23,833
- Why not? She may have forgotten it here.
- I don't know whose it is.

269
00:30:23,917 --> 00:30:25,667
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

270
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,583
- Oh, really?
- I said I don't!

271
00:30:29,792 --> 00:30:31,083
I will hit you!

272
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:33,250
- Don't you know?
- No.

273
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,792
Don't you? Wait.

274
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,917
- Don't break that!
- Why not?

275
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:39,833
- It's expensive.
- How much is it?

276
00:30:39,917 --> 00:30:41,625
Fifty five thousand rupees.

277
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:45,667
How will I watch Raj Kapoor's movies?

278
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:45,542
I know you are sleeping with her.

279
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:48,750
I will catch you red-handed, one day.

280
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:10,750
You like <i>Boomerang, </i>isn't it?

281
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,542
You kiss like a child.

282
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:16,167
Eat her, why don't you?

283
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:20,000
You are lying to me.

284
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,500
You text her in my class.

285
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:26,542
You were glued to each other
at the Comedy Club!

286
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:28,667
Do you think I'm blind?

287
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,583
Did you play Raj Kapoor's songs
for her as well?

288
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:39,125
You did, right?

289
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:49,833
Don't mock me!

290
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:52,167
I didn't realize

291
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:54,083
you would be so hurt.

292
00:33:56,208 --> 00:34:00,167
She is just using you!

293
00:34:01,292 --> 00:34:04,417
She is just showing-off.

294
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:08,167
On Instagram, Twitter...
She wants to show-off.

295
00:34:08,917 --> 00:34:11,792
She is using you like an Instagram filter.

296
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,167
You are the filter today.

297
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,958
Tomorrow, it will be Rahul.

298
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:18,750
Don't laugh.

299
00:34:19,542 --> 00:34:21,583
You should break up with her.

300
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:32,208
Do what you want.

301
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:42,792
- I didn't realize you would be hurt.
- Why are you repeating yourself?

302
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:47,417
I didn't realize you loved me so much.

303
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,667
I want to be with you.

304
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:54,167
- I will leave her for you.
- Have you lost it?

305
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,292
I'm married!

306
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:21,542
Please hand me a towel.

307
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:31,167
Not going to shower?

308
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,708
Dirty bitch!

309
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:39,500
Naked dog!

310
00:39:13,917 --> 00:39:15,583
How are you, Sudha?

311
00:39:15,917 --> 00:39:17,833
- All good?
- Yes.

312
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:22,167
Bless you.

313
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,042
You look very pretty.

314
00:39:24,167 --> 00:39:26,667
Ajit said you are taking
good care of the house.

315
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:28,917
- There are fragile things in that.
- Okay.

316
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:30,333
Okay?

317
00:39:31,292 --> 00:39:33,958
The house is very clean.

318
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:42,042
- Do you need anything?
- First, I will take a shower.

319
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:44,375
Take it.

320
00:39:44,708 --> 00:39:47,208
It's so humid here!

321
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:51,292
- Sudha! Put the water heater on.
- Okay.

322
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:53,333
Listen, should I give her these?

323
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:55,792
- Give her one.
- Okay.

324
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,833
Keep this bag inside.

325
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:03,417
This is for you.

326
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:05,708
Okay?

327
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,750
Come.

328
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:27,042
<i>Close the left nostril
and inhale using the right nostril.</i>

329
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:31,792
<i>Now close the right nostril
and exhale using the left nostril.</i>

330
00:40:32,792 --> 00:40:37,042
<i>Again, close the right nostril
and inhale through the left nostril.</i>

331
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:39,875
<i>Now close the left nostril...</i>

332
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:42,792
<i>Four terrorists killed in Bandipore
district of Jammu & Kashmir</i>

333
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:45,000
<i>while attempting to attack a pilgrimage...</i>

334
00:40:45,583 --> 00:40:47,125
- And?
- Three.

335
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:50,500
I have entered the number.

336
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:52,625
Wait for the password.

337
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:46,583
I'll get it.

338
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,667
- Come in.
- Greetings.

339
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,167
- Greetings!
- Welcome.

340
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:53,917
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

341
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:58,625
- Hi, dear. Come.
- Hello.

342
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:00,833
- Hello.
- Hello...

343
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:03,000
- Did you find parking?
- Yes.

344
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,292
Please sit.

345
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,500
- Please.
- Sit.

346
00:42:09,292 --> 00:42:12,958
You guys are early.
People are always late in Mumbai.

347
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
We left after the peak hours
and the roads were empty today.

348
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:19,917
We've been to this neighborhood before.

349
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,917
- I see.
- I didn't remember earlier.

350
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,458
But when we entered

351
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:28,417
I remembered that her cousin
used to live here.

352
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:30,833
My cousin's wife's family.

353
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:32,125
- Sorry.
- I see.

354
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:34,417
- People are decent here.
- Absolutely.

355
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,542
You're lucky to find a house in
this kind of locality.

356
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:41,708
He has this one-bedroom flat
because he's a bachelor.

357
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:43,792
The other flats are nice too.

358
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:46,542
Yes.

359
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:50,458
He comes home just to sleep.
Look at the mess here.

360
00:42:50,542 --> 00:42:53,333
I have asked him
to hang a painting at least.

361
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:54,917
I keep busy.

362
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,292
I am happy that he got the house painted.

363
00:42:59,583 --> 00:43:04,708
Guys are always reluctant.
They deserve praise if they eat properly.

364
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,750
Will you have tea or cold drinks?

365
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:11,125
Lemonade?

366
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:12,625
Ma'am...

367
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:14,792
- Some tea for us.
- Yes.

368
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:22,125
Has Ajit taken you
on a tour of Mumbai yet?

369
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:23,292
Sudha.

370
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:24,875
Make six cups of tea

371
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:28,000
and serve some snacks in the new bowls.

372
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:30,083
I was posted here.

373
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:32,042
Where?

374
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:34,917
Dungarsi Road.

375
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:36,667
He has started with his stories!

376
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:41,250
We used to live in the same area.
Just behind the Opera House.

377
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:43,958
We moved to Andheri after we got married.

378
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:46,500
But Mumbai has changed a lot.

379
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,000
Everything has.

380
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,125
So has Meerut.

381
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:52,083
It's so green now.

382
00:43:52,167 --> 00:43:55,292
Mr. Manoj, your area is nice too.

383
00:43:55,417 --> 00:43:58,167
It's an old building
but there is greenery around.

384
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,417
Like, you have sea views.
We have tree views.

385
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:08,292
It's a good one!

386
00:44:08,417 --> 00:44:10,375
You are a "Jokey" man.

387
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:12,083
The word is "Jovial".

388
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:13,417
They are the same.

389
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,625
My sister-in-law's family
speaks highly of you.

390
00:44:16,708 --> 00:44:19,042
Your brother-in-law is married
into that family, right?

391
00:44:19,125 --> 00:44:22,250
They are the reason we are here.

392
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:25,417
- Do you come to Mumbai often?
- Not really.

393
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:27,542
Once a year.

394
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:31,458
But Ajit comes to Meerut on festivals.

395
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:36,833
- Whenever he gets a break.
- Diwali must be spectacular in Meerut!

396
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:41,292
- Absolutely! We get new outfits made.
- I see.

397
00:44:41,375 --> 00:44:44,875
- We hold Lakshmi puja...
- We do that too.

398
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:49,833
And they play cards.
It's a cosmopolitan kind of Diwali!

399
00:44:49,917 --> 00:44:53,792
We have a Ram Leela performance there.
Ajit had played Ravana once!

400
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:55,083
Ravana!

401
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,125
- He forgot some lines!
- Oh!

402
00:44:57,208 --> 00:44:59,458
He was so nervous.

403
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,333
We will be right back.

404
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:06,792
Let me show her the house.

405
00:45:06,875 --> 00:45:08,708
- My small flat.
- Sure.

406
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:10,667
Go ahead.

407
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:21,542
They talk constantly.

408
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:24,167
Aparna told me that they have met twice.

409
00:45:24,667 --> 00:45:27,708
Nowadays, things are finalized
at coffee shops.

410
00:45:27,792 --> 00:45:30,500
- Marriages, business deals.
- Right.

411
00:45:30,583 --> 00:45:33,167
Even divorces!

412
00:45:33,708 --> 00:45:36,917
- Why are you talking about divorce?
- Why not? It's a fact of life

413
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:39,208
We will not get divorced.

414
00:45:39,292 --> 00:45:41,792
Oh, come on!

415
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:43,583
Never!

416
00:45:43,917 --> 00:45:45,667
They are a good match.

417
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:48,833
Similar lifestyles and values.

418
00:45:48,917 --> 00:45:52,333
The same profession. It's great.

419
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:55,500
- But mutual understanding is vital.
- Correct.

420
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,125
- If they want to be together...
- That is very important.

421
00:45:58,208 --> 00:45:59,250
True.

422
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:05,250
We saw Aparna for the first time
at Mr. Pramod's funeral.

423
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:07,500
- Were you there?
- Yes.

424
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:10,000
He was close to us.

425
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:12,000
He loved Ajit dearly.

426
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:14,292
He was a good man.

427
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:17,833
He introduced us to the astrologer.
We really believe in him.

428
00:46:17,917 --> 00:46:19,375
You have faith in him.

429
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:21,583
We showed him our horoscopes.

430
00:46:21,667 --> 00:46:24,917
- He told us so many things!
- Wow! Here comes the tea!

431
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,333
Please come.

432
00:46:29,125 --> 00:46:31,542
Did you add sugar? One more.

433
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:36,875
- Let him.
- He has diabetes.

434
00:46:37,875 --> 00:46:40,625
They are a great match.

435
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:44,250
Their horoscopes are compatible.

436
00:46:46,042 --> 00:46:47,542
Serve them inside.

437
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:53,542
She makes very good tea.

438
00:46:54,042 --> 00:46:55,417
It is very nice.

439
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:57,792
People prefer tea bags these days.

440
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,958
Does she cook?

441
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:04,917
She does, but not too well.

442
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:06,833
And do you cook?

443
00:47:06,917 --> 00:47:10,167
- Yes, but not non-veg dishes.
- Are you a vegetarian?

444
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:14,625
Yes, but Ajit is a carnivore.

445
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:25,500
The guy has a small brain!

446
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:20,292
I'm good.

447
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:24,250
Put it there.

448
00:48:43,875 --> 00:48:45,083
Ajit?

449
00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:11,250
- Mom, should we go?
- Did you show her the house?

450
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:14,917
- What do you think?
- Are you ready to give up chicken?

451
00:49:17,083 --> 00:49:18,833
Congratulations!

452
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:24,500
- Congratulations to you too!
- Congratulations.

453
00:49:24,625 --> 00:49:28,833
I knew things would work out today,
so I got some sweets.

454
00:49:29,417 --> 00:49:30,792
God bless you!

455
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:33,667
I will talk to my astrologer
and call you tomorrow.

456
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:35,083
- Yes, please.
- Definitely.

457
00:49:35,167 --> 00:49:36,333
Ajit!

458
00:49:36,417 --> 00:49:38,625
There is no need!

459
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:41,667
- We'll meet again.
- Sure.

460
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:44,042
- Congratulations once again.
- To you too.

461
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:46,333
- Keep in touch.
- Sure.

462
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:49,792
Call us, sometime. Okay.

463
00:49:56,458 --> 00:49:59,042
Sudha, Ajit is going to get married!

464
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:03,167
We will finalize the date soon.
Congratulations to you too!

465
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,708
Such a good family.

466
00:50:05,792 --> 00:50:08,500
Please take some sweets home.

467
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:30,542
Only one elevator is working, right?
It's a ten-minute wait if we miss it.

468
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:34,125
I was just about to leave
and Ms. Neha gave me some work.

469
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:37,792
"Dust the painting..." I did that
yesterday. She wanted me to do it again!

470
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:40,125
Am I to blame if someone
is renovating their home?

471
00:51:40,208 --> 00:51:43,083
"Sweep the balcony, water the plants..."
Annoying.

472
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:44,958
Should I show you something?

473
00:51:50,917 --> 00:51:52,708
Ms. Neha gave it to me.

474
00:51:56,667 --> 00:51:58,250
Beautiful, isn't it?

475
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:02,750
Pure silk and fully embroidered.

476
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:10,333
I will fix it or drape a scarf over it.

477
00:52:10,417 --> 00:52:12,292
It will look perfect.

478
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:15,042
- Absolutely!
- Isn't it?

479
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:18,292
I will wear it on my sister's wedding day.

480
00:52:29,792 --> 00:52:31,208
Wow!

481
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:37,333
You're not having one?

482
00:52:47,792 --> 00:52:50,417
You seem to have had a good day.

483
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,542
Help!

484
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:27,292
Why can't you swim?

485
00:54:28,042 --> 00:54:30,042
My dad wasn't a Country Club member.

486
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:33,667
- How do I look?
- Like a mother of two.

487
00:54:36,958 --> 00:54:38,083
Tea!

488
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,542
I'm not that fat.

489
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:41,833
<i>A woman's heart is lighter?</i>

490
00:55:41,917 --> 00:55:45,333
But it beats faster.
There are 11 more differences.

491
00:55:48,917 --> 00:55:51,667
The girls didn't even call me once.

492
00:55:52,542 --> 00:55:54,458
They binge-watching a show?

493
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,792
You are not going to be content...

494
00:56:21,542 --> 00:56:22,583
Talk to me.

495
00:56:22,667 --> 00:56:23,958
<i>Do you have a minute?</i>

496
00:56:25,042 --> 00:56:26,333
Sure.

497
00:56:27,042 --> 00:56:28,333
<i>Where are you?</i>

498
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:31,250
I...

499
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:33,083
<i>Where are you?</i>

500
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,542
At the beach house.

501
00:56:38,042 --> 00:56:39,333
<i>I'm coming over.</i>

502
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:43,125
Where are you, Salman?

503
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:44,792
<i>I'm coming.</i>

504
00:56:45,042 --> 00:56:45,917
Now?

505
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,167
We decided that you will come
after the housewarming!

506
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:52,417
Did you send me an email?

507
00:56:52,917 --> 00:56:54,125
What about?

508
00:57:01,208 --> 00:57:03,833
<i>I will email you all the details.</i>

509
00:57:03,917 --> 00:57:06,417
<i>- I will introduce you to Hardik.</i>
- Who is he?

510
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,792
<i>My lawyer.</i>

511
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:10,625
What do I say to him?

512
00:57:13,292 --> 00:57:15,792
- Why are you laughing?
<i>- That is the issue.</i>

513
00:57:18,625 --> 00:57:20,333
<i>What I mean is...</i>

514
00:57:21,667 --> 00:57:24,167
<i>you will take care of the girls
after I am gone.</i>

515
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:25,708
What do you mean?

516
00:57:30,375 --> 00:57:31,750
<i>Forget it, Sudhir!</i>

517
00:57:33,542 --> 00:57:34,750
Salman!

518
00:57:35,958 --> 00:57:39,250
<i>You will take care of them
after I am gone.</i>

519
00:57:39,333 --> 00:57:41,708
Where are you going? Where are you now?

520
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:45,458
<i>On my balcony, drinking.</i>

521
00:57:45,792 --> 00:57:49,042
<i>There is no one to give me ice
for the whiskey.</i>

522
00:57:49,458 --> 00:57:53,083
Where are the girls?

523
00:57:53,333 --> 00:57:57,125
<i>- Watching a movie with the nanny, I guess.</i>
- Did they have dinner?

524
00:57:58,542 --> 00:58:00,250
<i>Why don't you ask their mother?</i>

525
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:05,667
<i>The girls could be starving!
Where is the mother? Who is she with?</i>

526
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:08,917
<i>And why is her location service disabled?</i>

527
00:58:09,083 --> 00:58:10,917
- What are you talking about?
- <i>Sudhir...</i>

528
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,625
<i>Sudhir, Reena is bored of me.</i>

529
00:58:17,583 --> 00:58:18,917
<i>- Got it?</i>
- Salman...

530
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:24,625
Listen to yourself!

531
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:32,625
<i>In 13 years of our marriage,
she was happy for only 11 months.</i>

532
00:58:38,875 --> 00:58:41,500
<i>I bet, she will not answer my call.</i>

533
00:58:44,042 --> 00:58:46,042
- Salman, stop the drama.
<i>- Sudhir, listen...</i>

534
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,042
<i>Listen...</i>

535
00:58:57,458 --> 00:58:59,125
- Salman.
<i>- She will not take the call!</i>

536
00:58:59,292 --> 00:59:01,000
<i>I bet.</i>

537
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:06,333
<i>What if I was in an accident?</i>

538
00:59:07,417 --> 00:59:08,833
You have lost it!

539
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:24,667
<i>Let the boring husband die!</i>

540
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,875
<i>Are you listening?</i>

541
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:42,000
<i>Enjoy your beach life.</i>

542
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:03,792
Find out what's wrong.

543
01:00:04,042 --> 01:00:05,208
Nothing is wrong.

544
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:06,625
He is pretending.

545
01:00:11,042 --> 01:00:12,958
Don't tell him I asked you to.

546
01:00:36,292 --> 01:00:37,625
What is it, Salman?

547
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:48,583
- You can call Sudhir up but not me.
<i>- He is my buddy. I have every right!</i>

548
01:00:50,917 --> 01:00:51,917
I'm at Geeta's.

549
01:00:52,583 --> 01:00:53,792
Have you gone nuts?

550
01:00:54,208 --> 01:00:56,208
<i>Assume I have.</i>

551
01:00:56,708 --> 01:00:58,125
<i>Tell me this.</i>

552
01:00:58,833 --> 01:01:05,500
<i>Why did Geeta tell me
that things are not okay between us</i>

553
01:01:07,208 --> 01:01:09,125
<i>and that you are not at her place?</i>

554
01:01:12,083 --> 01:01:13,458
<i>Why did she say that?</i>

555
01:01:14,917 --> 01:01:16,042
<i>Reena.</i>

556
01:01:23,917 --> 01:01:25,000
He knows.

557
01:01:26,417 --> 01:01:27,625
How?

558
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:30,917
How?

559
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,333
Geeta told him that I'm not with her.

560
01:01:34,667 --> 01:01:36,917
What else has she told him?

561
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,917
How would I know?

562
01:01:45,208 --> 01:01:48,125
We don't send each other
messages or emails!

563
01:01:48,875 --> 01:01:50,625
We meet once in a while.

564
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:53,542
- Are we being followed?
- We are not.

565
01:01:53,708 --> 01:01:55,667
Otherwise, he wouldn't have called Geeta.

566
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:03,542
What did you tell Geeta?

567
01:02:03,833 --> 01:02:07,458
I texted her that I was going on a tour
with my HSBC colleague.

568
01:02:12,708 --> 01:02:14,583
I feel guilty.

569
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:17,208
What have I become?

570
01:02:18,042 --> 01:02:20,667
My children are hungry
and my husband is spying on me.

571
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,875
Not Geeta, I'm the bitch.

572
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:31,792
Tell him you are here.

573
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:36,042
Tell him you are here to talk to me.

574
01:02:36,917 --> 01:02:38,000
What about?

575
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:41,750
About your fights. Okay?

576
01:02:42,292 --> 01:02:46,375
End this Geeta chapter now

577
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,542
or you'll be caught in a lie.

578
01:02:48,958 --> 01:02:51,917
Tell him that you came to me for advice.

579
01:02:57,458 --> 01:02:58,542
<i>You hung up on me?</i>

580
01:03:03,958 --> 01:03:05,833
- At Sudhir's.
<i>- What!</i>

581
01:03:07,625 --> 01:03:09,625
- At his beach house.
<i>- What!</i>

582
01:03:10,667 --> 01:03:13,042
<i>You're there before the housewarming?</i>

583
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,917
- I needed to talk.
- <i>About what?</i>

584
01:03:20,083 --> 01:03:21,333
About us...

585
01:03:21,708 --> 01:03:24,292
Our fights.

586
01:03:30,167 --> 01:03:32,792
<i>Do I go to him and rat on you?</i>

587
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:35,167
<i>In 12 years of our marriage,
I didn't bore you for 10 months.</i>

588
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:37,208
<i>Do you know why?</i>

589
01:03:43,875 --> 01:03:44,958
In a party.

590
01:03:45,167 --> 01:03:49,417
<i>At the Kishore Thadani one, last week?</i>

591
01:03:50,542 --> 01:03:51,500
Yes.

592
01:03:51,583 --> 01:03:56,125
<i>Reena, Kishore came to our house</i>

593
01:03:56,208 --> 01:03:57,958
<i>and you were seeking sympathy?</i>

594
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,583
<i>What else?</i>

595
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:02,000
<i>Kishore Thadani of Sunrise Capital!</i>

596
01:04:04,167 --> 01:04:06,333
<i>He will invest 200 crore rupees
in my company!</i>

597
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,792
<i>12 years as a banker
and you have learned nothing!</i>

598
01:04:15,417 --> 01:04:17,000
<i>Our daughters' education.</i>

599
01:04:17,083 --> 01:04:19,750
<i>Dad's 10 crore rupees loan and the debt!</i>

600
01:04:22,167 --> 01:04:23,250
You or I?

601
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:25,417
It's a 2 crore loan.

602
01:04:26,625 --> 01:04:28,792
You have selfish motives.

603
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:35,042
Kishore, the beach house and me...
We are trophies for you!

604
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:43,292
I'm coming home.

605
01:04:43,792 --> 01:04:45,083
<i>What if I don't?</i>

606
01:04:46,708 --> 01:04:47,750
What do you mean?

607
01:04:47,833 --> 01:04:51,375
<i>You said I like to collect trophies.</i>

608
01:04:51,792 --> 01:04:54,042
<i>What will you do if
I stop collecting them?</i>

609
01:04:55,083 --> 01:04:56,792
I will live my life.

610
01:04:58,625 --> 01:04:59,750
<i>What is it about?</i>

611
01:05:01,083 --> 01:05:02,708
<i>Branch Manager, MG Road!</i>

612
01:05:06,917 --> 01:05:08,917
<i>Tell me. What is its worth?</i>

613
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,417
<i>Your life is</i>

614
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:14,250
<i>what I permit it to be. Nothing more.</i>

615
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:19,208
<i>What kind of life will you have
without me?</i>

616
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:30,875
<i>The girls are hungry. Come home.</i>

617
01:05:40,792 --> 01:05:42,083
<i>That's enough.</i>

618
01:05:42,458 --> 01:05:43,458
<i>Come back.</i>

619
01:05:49,583 --> 01:05:50,708
<i>Reena?</i>

620
01:06:10,958 --> 01:06:11,958
Sudhir,

621
01:06:14,125 --> 01:06:15,625
should we tell Salman?

622
01:06:16,458 --> 01:06:17,417
About what?

623
01:06:30,083 --> 01:06:32,250
Start working again.

624
01:06:32,542 --> 01:06:34,750
Half of your problems will be solved.

625
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:40,917
What about the remaining half?

626
01:06:42,583 --> 01:06:47,708
Salman told me that I should be happy
that he has granted me freedom.

627
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:56,542
Let's just tell him about it.

628
01:06:59,833 --> 01:07:01,583
What's so complex here?

629
01:07:03,792 --> 01:07:05,958
- It's not?
- This is life.

630
01:07:08,458 --> 01:07:10,167
This is an allowance.

631
01:07:11,917 --> 01:07:13,250
You know Salman.

632
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:16,542
- He talks shit and forgets about it.
- I don't.

633
01:07:26,833 --> 01:07:28,333
He will be here soon.

634
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:37,083
- What?
- I told him to come over.

635
01:07:38,875 --> 01:07:40,083
Who did you call?

636
01:07:41,542 --> 01:07:44,042
You should have told me.

637
01:07:44,667 --> 01:07:45,792
How could you do this?

638
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:50,583
Is this not about me as well?

639
01:07:51,542 --> 01:07:53,125
- Get dressed!
- I am dressed!

640
01:07:53,708 --> 01:07:56,917
He wasn't supposed to come here
before the housewarming!

641
01:07:58,292 --> 01:07:59,542
Why are you laughing?

642
01:08:00,125 --> 01:08:01,458
Get dressed!

643
01:08:11,208 --> 01:08:12,292
Wear them.

644
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:13,417
Why?

645
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:15,792
You always wear them at home.

646
01:08:15,875 --> 01:08:18,542
- Not here.
- I don't want him to notice.

647
01:08:21,333 --> 01:08:25,500
What has Salman got to do
with our relationship?

648
01:08:27,167 --> 01:08:29,125
Stop being childish!

649
01:08:29,875 --> 01:08:32,292
I knew that you had a crush on me
in college.

650
01:08:33,292 --> 01:08:34,542
Did you ever talk to me?

651
01:08:36,375 --> 01:08:39,333
If Salman didn't make a scene.
at Jamshed's party,

652
01:08:39,458 --> 01:08:40,875
would you have dropped me off?

653
01:08:46,417 --> 01:08:48,167
Would you have kissed me

654
01:08:48,917 --> 01:08:50,500
if I wasn't Salman's wife?

655
01:08:53,625 --> 01:08:56,583
Can we meet again if Salman
learns about us?

656
01:09:00,917 --> 01:09:02,375
Sudhir,

657
01:09:03,083 --> 01:09:04,708
if he learns the truth...

658
01:09:08,167 --> 01:09:09,583
Our marriage will end.

659
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,417
What about your daughters?

660
01:09:18,583 --> 01:09:21,333
Why do you always involve them?

661
01:09:21,417 --> 01:09:23,375
- Am I not supposed to?
- No.

662
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:26,833
They will be raised as children
of divorced parents are.

663
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:34,000
I'm done, Sudhir.

664
01:09:36,375 --> 01:09:40,500
I cannot take this anymore.

665
01:09:42,167 --> 01:09:45,375
If you want a divorce,
what is the point in telling him?

666
01:09:45,458 --> 01:09:48,458
When he sees us together
after our divorce...

667
01:09:51,583 --> 01:09:53,917
Us together?

668
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Yes.

669
01:10:17,583 --> 01:10:18,667
Yes.

670
01:10:25,375 --> 01:10:26,875
Forward the email to me.

671
01:10:28,208 --> 01:10:29,500
Alright?

672
01:10:30,083 --> 01:10:31,208
Okay then. Bye.

673
01:10:35,583 --> 01:10:36,917
It's nice.

674
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:41,042
I repainted the walls.

675
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:43,833
The contractor's dog died.
So the work stalled.

676
01:10:43,917 --> 01:10:45,375
It looks empty, doesn't it?

677
01:10:45,458 --> 01:10:46,667
Empty is good!

678
01:10:47,083 --> 01:10:48,250
We all need space.

679
01:10:48,917 --> 01:10:51,917
- Get me a house like this.
- Yours is better, pal!

680
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:55,583
But I have no voice there.

681
01:10:55,708 --> 01:10:57,500
Even this house belonged to a couple.

682
01:11:09,083 --> 01:11:11,167
She looks pretty in your house.

683
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:16,875
How much did it cost you?

684
01:11:17,958 --> 01:11:20,500
Not much. It belonged to a couple

685
01:11:21,583 --> 01:11:23,958
and I got a good deal out of
the property separation.

686
01:11:25,792 --> 01:11:30,500
- What does Kishore Thadani have to say?
- He's your friend. You will know better.

687
01:11:30,792 --> 01:11:32,292
He is. Keep at it.

688
01:11:34,292 --> 01:11:36,417
She is up to something.

689
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,875
- You provoke her.
- Really?

690
01:11:40,083 --> 01:11:42,000
You just know her version.

691
01:11:42,083 --> 01:11:44,875
- No one hears me out.
- Did she?

692
01:11:44,958 --> 01:11:46,542
No!

693
01:11:47,125 --> 01:11:48,375
She always talks back.

694
01:11:48,917 --> 01:11:51,458
"I gave up my career for you and the kids!

695
01:11:52,042 --> 01:11:53,708
I could have been something!"

696
01:11:54,083 --> 01:11:56,792
She's the Queen of "Could Have Been".

697
01:11:56,875 --> 01:11:59,208
Could've been a CEO,
a film star or an Olympian!

698
01:11:59,625 --> 01:12:01,125
No matter what...

699
01:12:01,458 --> 01:12:03,583
You must not use the word "Allowance"
with her.

700
01:12:03,667 --> 01:12:05,000
But why did she lie...

701
01:12:06,083 --> 01:12:07,375
So what? She is Reena!

702
01:12:08,583 --> 01:12:09,833
Don't you get her?

703
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:11,792
She was the most
sought after girl in college.

704
01:12:11,875 --> 01:12:13,792
No one had the balls to ask her out.

705
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:16,917
Except you.

706
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:21,167
Handling family matters is not my forte.

707
01:12:21,792 --> 01:12:25,458
Talk to her lovingly and take her home.

708
01:12:25,542 --> 01:12:27,208
Didn't you get married as well?

709
01:12:30,292 --> 01:12:31,333
Don't you know?

710
01:12:32,542 --> 01:12:33,542
How could I?

711
01:12:34,792 --> 01:12:38,750
Your mom sent me the invitation card
six months after I got married.

712
01:12:38,875 --> 01:12:40,667
I ate veg <i>Biryani</i> at your wedding.

713
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:44,833
You went away for a year and then
I heard about your divorce.

714
01:12:44,917 --> 01:12:46,708
It has been ten years now! Forget it.

715
01:12:47,333 --> 01:12:48,667
You have bigger worries.

716
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,417
Sometimes I feel like...

717
01:12:54,042 --> 01:12:55,333
What did she say?

718
01:12:56,458 --> 01:12:57,958
"She cannot live with me."

719
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:03,500
Should I divorce her?

720
01:13:04,458 --> 01:13:06,042
Have you lost it?

721
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:18,958
Listen.

722
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:21,833
You will never find anyone better.

723
01:13:24,375 --> 01:13:27,292
Everything! She loves your daughters.

724
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,750
- You cannot live without her.
- But

725
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:37,833
Kishore Thadani had come home

726
01:13:39,292 --> 01:13:41,125
and she was crying.

727
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:42,958
When did that happen?

728
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:44,458
You were right there!

729
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,500
How could she?

730
01:13:55,625 --> 01:13:58,375
Let's watch an action movie tonight.
What do you think, Reena?

731
01:13:58,458 --> 01:13:59,875
Sure. Catch a late night show.

732
01:14:03,083 --> 01:14:04,375
It's only a suggestion.

733
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:06,750
You only suggest
the things you want to do.

734
01:14:17,125 --> 01:14:19,958
I sat through that boring movie
you took me to.

735
01:14:20,208 --> 01:14:22,750
I didn't complain.

736
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:27,000
You had decided not to like it.

737
01:14:27,458 --> 01:14:28,708
Who decided this?

738
01:14:29,292 --> 01:14:32,833
A movie should entertain.
It should display patriotism or love.

739
01:14:33,417 --> 01:14:36,458
You like open-ended movies
and I, black and white.

740
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,292
I'm tired!

741
01:14:39,375 --> 01:14:41,583
Both of you are.

742
01:14:42,125 --> 01:14:44,000
Eat and go to bed.

743
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,542
Am I an idiot?

744
01:14:46,875 --> 01:14:48,042
I drove all the way here.

745
01:14:48,125 --> 01:14:52,167
You're wise and I'm an idiot.

746
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:53,750
- Keep saying it.
- I will.

747
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:56,000
Remember that guy

748
01:14:56,083 --> 01:14:58,792
- who would say everything three times?
- Yes.

749
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:00,792
He was so strange!

750
01:15:02,792 --> 01:15:05,292
The waiter got three plates of food.

751
01:15:08,042 --> 01:15:09,125
What would he say?

752
01:15:09,208 --> 01:15:11,542
Thapar is going to...

753
01:15:15,625 --> 01:15:17,083
- Where is he now?
- Dallas.

754
01:15:17,167 --> 01:15:19,375
He sold his startup
and is living it up there.

755
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:23,083
Let's plan a reunion. Start a group.

756
01:15:24,333 --> 01:15:27,458
Those were the days!
The coffee and the movies!

757
01:15:28,292 --> 01:15:31,292
This guy introduced me to black coffee.

758
01:15:31,792 --> 01:15:34,292
- I was broke. He took care of me.
- Sudhir...

759
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:40,125
Can Salman and I talk?

760
01:15:43,333 --> 01:15:44,917
- Here or...
- Yes.

761
01:15:47,792 --> 01:15:50,167
- Is it comfortable here?
- It is.

762
01:16:09,125 --> 01:16:10,208
He is right.

763
01:16:11,042 --> 01:16:12,500
Wash your hands. Let's go home.

764
01:16:43,667 --> 01:16:46,292
<i>Heart Matters. Your YouTube channel.</i>

765
01:16:48,833 --> 01:16:50,167
<i>But how...</i>

766
01:16:52,375 --> 01:16:54,542
<i>I always wanted to be an IAS officer.</i>

767
01:16:54,625 --> 01:16:56,792
<i>My father taught in a Government school.</i>

768
01:16:56,875 --> 01:16:59,917
<i>That is where I went to study.</i>

769
01:17:01,125 --> 01:17:04,333
<i>Maybe, that is why my English accent is...</i>

770
01:17:19,917 --> 01:17:21,583
It's not that simple.

771
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:28,667
I get irritated with you.

772
01:17:29,667 --> 01:17:30,792
How?

773
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:34,792
I feel stuck.

774
01:17:37,167 --> 01:17:38,667
What does that mean?

775
01:17:41,542 --> 01:17:43,917
Tell me what the problem is.

776
01:17:44,417 --> 01:17:46,500
You need a mother, not a wife.

777
01:17:49,292 --> 01:17:50,458
I can't do it.

778
01:17:57,667 --> 01:18:00,708
Sudhir saw me crying at Jamshed's party

779
01:18:02,125 --> 01:18:04,167
not at Kishore Thadani's.

780
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:09,083
Sudhir and I

781
01:18:11,625 --> 01:18:13,292
have been together for three years.

782
01:18:20,542 --> 01:18:22,875
Sudhir Batra? Indiabulls?

783
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:30,708
<i>My father suffered a stroke.</i>

784
01:18:30,792 --> 01:18:34,708
<i>We could not afford the treatment.
He passed away.</i>

785
01:18:35,417 --> 01:18:39,250
<i>That is when I decided
to be a heart surgeon.</i>

786
01:18:41,417 --> 01:18:44,667
<i>So it all started with a tragedy.</i>

787
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,542
<i>Let me tell you...</i>

788
01:18:59,875 --> 01:19:00,958
Sudhir?

789
01:19:25,083 --> 01:19:29,583
<i>It is a reversible process.
Take care of it and you will be fine.</i>

790
01:19:30,083 --> 01:19:32,708
<i>We are there to mend its flaws.</i>

791
01:19:33,125 --> 01:19:36,208
<i>But I have been more concerned...</i>

792
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:40,625
Salman wants to talk.

793
01:20:09,208 --> 01:20:10,583
Thadani texted.

794
01:20:12,125 --> 01:20:13,167
<i>"Hi Salman."</i>

795
01:20:21,875 --> 01:20:23,625
<i>"Take good care of my money."</i>

796
01:20:43,875 --> 01:20:45,042
Yes.

797
01:20:49,167 --> 01:20:50,375
I'm exhausted.

798
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:53,083
Crash here.

799
01:20:54,667 --> 01:20:55,833
I'll show you the bedroom.

800
01:23:54,125 --> 01:23:55,625
What are the plans for Saturday?

801
01:23:56,625 --> 01:23:57,500
Your call.

802
01:23:58,458 --> 01:23:59,500
Golf?

803
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:02,417
Let's have lunch with Ranjeet after that.

804
01:24:03,208 --> 01:24:04,250
Is he back?

805
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:05,792
How is he doing?

806
01:24:09,333 --> 01:24:10,917
His profile on Tinder says...

807
01:24:13,375 --> 01:24:15,458
He can't even catch a Frisbee.

808
01:24:16,917 --> 01:24:18,750
- Salman.
- Thadani's team is visiting today.

809
01:24:18,875 --> 01:24:21,000
I left my sunglasses inside.

810
01:24:21,458 --> 01:24:22,500
Sudhir.

811
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:42,250
- Sudhir...
- Not now.

812
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:45,458
We will talk later.

813
01:24:46,583 --> 01:24:47,917
Will I see you again?

814
01:25:05,917 --> 01:25:07,333
He said two things

815
01:25:13,667 --> 01:25:14,792
And he said...

816
01:25:20,042 --> 01:25:21,708
you can't find out

817
01:25:22,833 --> 01:25:24,333
that he knows about us.

818
01:25:58,875 --> 01:26:01,125
- Did you say anything to him?
- No.

819
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:08,000
What did I say at Jamshed's party?

820
01:26:09,125 --> 01:26:10,167
Nothing.

821
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:14,583
- So you guys were...
- He called me two days later.

822
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:15,917
I didn't take it.

823
01:26:17,625 --> 01:26:19,917
I called him back after a week.

824
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,458
After we fought again?

825
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:25,792
No.

826
01:26:30,625 --> 01:26:32,375
It was a peaceful day.

827
01:26:42,292 --> 01:26:45,125
Libertina! The fish was outstanding!

828
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:24,708
Ms. Rekha...

829
01:27:25,583 --> 01:27:26,625
Principal.

830
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:29,417
How's the library?

831
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:32,292
I got it cleaned.

832
01:27:32,375 --> 01:27:34,542
- The books?
- The fans.

833
01:27:34,625 --> 01:27:36,208
Who reads books these days?

834
01:27:36,292 --> 01:27:38,250
The library is always empty.

835
01:27:38,417 --> 01:27:42,792
Come to my office for a cup of tea.
I have asked you several times.

836
01:27:43,375 --> 01:27:46,375
I don't drink tea, sir.
I have told you this before.

837
01:27:47,083 --> 01:27:48,458
Is that it?

838
01:27:57,125 --> 01:28:01,708
The principal's eyes will pop out one day.

839
01:28:03,167 --> 01:28:04,708
Megha...

840
01:28:05,083 --> 01:28:07,583
Are you having a tough time?

841
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:10,625
- I can't do it.
- I know.

842
01:28:11,375 --> 01:28:12,792
Come. Let me.

843
01:28:15,333 --> 01:28:18,583
Not every person can fire a bullet.

844
01:28:19,583 --> 01:28:21,000
Look at me.

845
01:28:21,208 --> 01:28:23,125
I am an acclaimed marksman.

846
01:28:24,042 --> 01:28:27,458
Be ready to fire one.

847
01:28:28,333 --> 01:28:31,458
- Is it too revealing?
- I wish it was.

848
01:28:32,875 --> 01:28:35,083
You are too much!

849
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:36,708
Go! You'll be late!

850
01:28:36,792 --> 01:28:38,333
Good luck, soldier!

851
01:28:39,292 --> 01:28:41,083
- Megha Verma?
- Yes?

852
01:28:41,667 --> 01:28:44,708
This is my daughter, Sanditi.
Sorry, I'm late for the meeting.

853
01:28:44,792 --> 01:28:46,042
She never told me.

854
01:28:46,125 --> 01:28:48,208
She is an excellent student!
I have no complaints.

855
01:28:48,292 --> 01:28:49,333
I have some.

856
01:28:50,167 --> 01:28:52,542
Thank God I checked her phone!

857
01:28:53,125 --> 01:28:54,375
Look what she is up to!

858
01:28:54,458 --> 01:28:56,375
- She's eating ice cream.
- I am...

859
01:28:56,458 --> 01:28:58,667
Did you not like the flavor?

860
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:01,208
This is an all-girls school.

861
01:29:01,292 --> 01:29:03,958
How could she do all this here?

862
01:29:04,042 --> 01:29:06,417
She has uploaded it on telegram.

863
01:29:06,583 --> 01:29:07,792
It's Instagram, Mom!

864
01:29:07,875 --> 01:29:13,083
They participate in debates together.
That's how they have become friends.

865
01:29:13,708 --> 01:29:15,333
Please, Ms. Rekha!

866
01:29:15,417 --> 01:29:20,042
You will make them forget our culture!

867
01:29:20,125 --> 01:29:22,542
Such a compliment!

868
01:29:22,625 --> 01:29:23,917
Hold on!

869
01:29:24,208 --> 01:29:26,417
Can you do something about her uniform?

870
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:30,417
This skirt is too short.

871
01:29:31,167 --> 01:29:33,292
Why not ask them to wear
<i>salwar-kameez</i> instead?

872
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:35,500
It will keep their legs covered.

873
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:57,042
- Sorry for being late, Paras.
- No problem!

874
01:29:59,292 --> 01:30:01,083
I was hanging out with my friend.

875
01:30:11,667 --> 01:30:13,333
So... how are you?

876
01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:21,542
Should we make small talk
or get to the point?

877
01:30:22,833 --> 01:30:25,667
Some small talk to start with.

878
01:30:27,792 --> 01:30:30,042
Do you need to use a shawl now?

879
01:30:30,167 --> 01:30:31,417
I am feeling cold.

880
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:34,708
Take it off. You are sweating.

881
01:30:40,583 --> 01:30:42,458
You can keep it on, if you like.

882
01:30:43,875 --> 01:30:44,958
I'm good.

883
01:30:49,833 --> 01:30:54,667
This is our third meeting.
And this time, without our families.

884
01:30:55,417 --> 01:30:57,958
So I want to speak openly.

885
01:30:58,042 --> 01:30:59,750
Sure.

886
01:31:00,333 --> 01:31:05,000
I'm a little shy.
I have never asked a girl for her number.

887
01:31:07,417 --> 01:31:11,042
- No, I did when I took her sari.
- What!

888
01:31:11,333 --> 01:31:14,667
"I spilled my drink on her on the train."
So, I kept her sari with me.

889
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:17,042
- You took her sari off on the train?
- Yes!

890
01:31:17,125 --> 01:31:18,708
No, I mean...

891
01:31:19,208 --> 01:31:21,958
- The next day, I took it to get washed..
- I see.

892
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:24,583
But the stains were stubborn.

893
01:31:27,542 --> 01:31:29,500
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course!

894
01:31:30,083 --> 01:31:32,667
Did you spill the drink intentionally?

895
01:31:34,917 --> 01:31:36,500
Please, Megha.

896
01:31:40,083 --> 01:31:42,917
I studied in an all-boys school.
I don't have game.

897
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,208
I have heard that all-boys school students

898
01:31:45,292 --> 01:31:49,500
often treat all-girls school students
to ice creams.

899
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,083
What!

900
01:31:55,167 --> 01:31:57,250
You are smart, Megha.

901
01:31:57,833 --> 01:32:01,667
You are trying to distract me
but it won't work.

902
01:32:07,042 --> 01:32:08,250
Shall we get to the point?

903
01:32:08,833 --> 01:32:10,750
- No.
- Why not?

904
01:32:11,375 --> 01:32:12,958
He's a nice boy!

905
01:32:13,083 --> 01:32:15,458
He has a good job! He has good values.

906
01:32:16,042 --> 01:32:18,833
He is respectable and respectful.

907
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:21,833
He is not fair skinned

908
01:32:22,208 --> 01:32:23,917
but you balance that out.

909
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,375
So what is the problem?

910
01:32:28,833 --> 01:32:31,667
I cannot judge guys.

911
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:32,833
What do you mean?

912
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:36,458
I did not study in a coed school.

913
01:32:37,167 --> 01:32:39,458
No freedom or allowance.

914
01:32:40,042 --> 01:32:44,542
I wasn't brave enough to
meet boys from other schools

915
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:46,917
or hang out with them

916
01:32:47,708 --> 01:32:50,292
or eat ice creams together.

917
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,625
That is why I want you

918
01:32:56,292 --> 01:32:57,833
to get married.

919
01:32:58,250 --> 01:33:00,500
You can have ice cream
to your heart's delight.

920
01:33:32,125 --> 01:33:33,875
<i>This is amazing!</i>

921
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:56,208
- Looking for someone?
- Friends show up to prank us, I heard.

922
01:33:58,583 --> 01:33:59,792
No one did.

923
01:34:01,375 --> 01:34:02,792
Please come in.

924
01:34:09,292 --> 01:34:11,500
They must have gotten
wasted and gone home.

925
01:34:12,833 --> 01:34:14,583
- Come on.
- What!

926
01:34:20,292 --> 01:34:21,375
Sit.

927
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:39,667
If you could be an animal,
which one would you be?

928
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:41,208
What kind of a question is that?

929
01:34:41,792 --> 01:34:45,500
At work we ask silly questions a lot.
But, it's fun.

930
01:34:48,042 --> 01:34:50,833
- So tell me.
- Animal?

931
01:34:53,083 --> 01:34:54,208
A cat.

932
01:34:54,458 --> 01:34:55,583
A cat!

933
01:34:57,542 --> 01:34:59,125
They have nine lives.

934
01:35:00,208 --> 01:35:02,625
Seven with me... and an another two!

935
01:35:03,375 --> 01:35:04,542
Meow!

936
01:35:06,958 --> 01:35:09,000
What about you?

937
01:35:11,875 --> 01:35:13,333
An alligator.

938
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:16,167
The sleeping devil.

939
01:35:17,167 --> 01:35:18,458
Beware! He can bite!

940
01:35:21,125 --> 01:35:23,083
Do you know anything about alligators?

941
01:35:23,167 --> 01:35:24,208
No.

942
01:35:24,333 --> 01:35:26,375
I have watched Nat Geo a lot.

943
01:35:26,458 --> 01:35:30,792
Male alligators blow bubbles in the water.

944
01:35:31,833 --> 01:35:32,667
Really!

945
01:35:33,458 --> 01:35:34,292
Why?

946
01:35:34,875 --> 01:35:37,000
To attract the females!

947
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,625
To excite them.

948
01:35:40,458 --> 01:35:42,833
- Do you want some water?
- I'm fine!

949
01:35:45,042 --> 01:35:46,750
Okay, I'll have some.

950
01:36:41,833 --> 01:36:43,000
Congratulations.

951
01:37:01,917 --> 01:37:03,375
Are you drying your hair?

952
01:37:12,125 --> 01:37:13,542
Are you drying the clothes?

953
01:37:53,875 --> 01:37:55,792
Are you chopping tomatoes?

954
01:37:56,083 --> 01:37:57,250
No.

955
01:38:13,750 --> 01:38:16,833
Mom is happy as long as the neighbors are.

956
01:38:17,417 --> 01:38:23,250
I will be happy only when
I become a grandma of two.

957
01:38:23,333 --> 01:38:26,250
Oh, Mom! You never fail to mention that.

958
01:38:26,333 --> 01:38:27,625
Keep quiet.

959
01:38:28,250 --> 01:38:29,917
Only us women will understand.

960
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,542
- What do you say?
- Right.

961
01:38:32,042 --> 01:38:36,167
You guys talk,
we are going to go get some air.

962
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:45,958
Listen to us, Megha.

963
01:38:47,042 --> 01:38:49,167
Look at my other daughter-in-law.

964
01:38:49,250 --> 01:38:50,917
She is so happy.

965
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:56,458
She had two kids, one after the other.

966
01:38:57,042 --> 01:38:59,333
She spends the whole day
looking after them.

967
01:38:59,458 --> 01:39:01,458
She does not need to
break a sweat anymore.

968
01:39:01,542 --> 01:39:04,292
- Break a sweat?
- Yes.

969
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:06,542
Listen,

970
01:39:07,333 --> 01:39:10,250
your mother-in-law squawks all day

971
01:39:10,417 --> 01:39:12,500
and the bed squeaks all night.

972
01:39:13,083 --> 01:39:17,375
This will end once you have kids.

973
01:39:19,208 --> 01:39:22,542
When desires are fulfilled,
the toil will end.

974
01:39:23,917 --> 01:39:26,833
What if they are not?

975
01:39:27,417 --> 01:39:28,542
Oh, come on!

976
01:39:30,042 --> 01:39:31,167
Tell me something,

977
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:35,083
does a woman desire
anything more than a child?

978
01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:36,833
No.

979
01:39:37,958 --> 01:39:39,000
There you go.

980
01:39:43,833 --> 01:39:50,750
So this is why you are upset. I noticed

981
01:39:51,708 --> 01:39:53,792
what mom said upset you.

982
01:39:54,708 --> 01:39:58,292
Don't worry about her.
We will have a kid later.

983
01:39:58,583 --> 01:40:00,500
We must make love now.

984
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:03,417
Endlessly.

985
01:40:03,917 --> 01:40:06,250
You look so happy after marriage.

986
01:40:06,417 --> 01:40:08,042
You are always excited!

987
01:40:08,125 --> 01:40:09,125
Hey!

988
01:40:09,208 --> 01:40:12,000
So are you.

989
01:40:12,208 --> 01:40:14,250
You are happy, too.

990
01:40:18,833 --> 01:40:21,000
Have you ever watched an adult film?

991
01:40:21,792 --> 01:40:22,750
What?

992
01:40:25,208 --> 01:40:26,333
Have you?

993
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:28,542
Yes.

994
01:40:28,625 --> 01:40:30,375
Back in college.

995
01:40:30,458 --> 01:40:32,625
Even last month... Why?

996
01:40:34,750 --> 01:40:36,583
When the guy says...

997
01:40:43,333 --> 01:40:44,958
And the girl says...

998
01:40:51,833 --> 01:40:54,125
They have a good time together.

999
01:40:54,708 --> 01:40:55,917
Together.

1000
01:40:58,583 --> 01:40:59,625
Yes!

1001
01:40:59,958 --> 01:41:01,917
I have never understood that!

1002
01:41:02,583 --> 01:41:04,458
You either talk or have sex!

1003
01:41:04,542 --> 01:41:06,500
Do either of the two.

1004
01:41:06,583 --> 01:41:08,958
Why do it together?

1005
01:41:09,292 --> 01:41:11,125
At work,

1006
01:41:11,333 --> 01:41:14,167
I either check the accounts or type.

1007
01:41:14,250 --> 01:41:16,000
I never do both together.

1008
01:41:16,167 --> 01:41:17,583
It doesn't make sense.

1009
01:41:17,792 --> 01:41:19,375
Look! Birds!

1010
01:41:24,542 --> 01:41:26,375
Take these birds for example.

1011
01:41:26,625 --> 01:41:28,792
They either lay eggs or fly.

1012
01:41:28,875 --> 01:41:31,625
Have you seen a flying bird lay eggs?

1013
01:41:40,250 --> 01:41:41,083
What's wrong?

1014
01:41:42,167 --> 01:41:43,458
Nothing...

1015
01:41:43,542 --> 01:41:46,083
Megha, the Principal has called you.

1016
01:41:48,458 --> 01:41:49,375
Go.

1017
01:41:53,292 --> 01:41:56,292
Tell me what to do.

1018
01:41:56,458 --> 01:41:59,792
Look at the books in this school!
Why would you issue such a book?

1019
01:41:59,875 --> 01:42:01,583
- It was not me...
- Hold on.

1020
01:42:01,667 --> 01:42:03,250
She did not issue the book.

1021
01:42:05,917 --> 01:42:08,958
Who else could it be?

1022
01:42:09,542 --> 01:42:12,583
No wonder. She's a divorcee after all.

1023
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:17,167
Let me take a look at it.

1024
01:42:19,208 --> 01:42:20,292
I see.

1025
01:42:21,417 --> 01:42:22,458
What is it about?

1026
01:42:23,042 --> 01:42:24,792
- I have not read it, sir.
<i>- Lolita!</i>

1027
01:42:25,583 --> 01:42:29,667
Read it.
It is about an incestual relationship.

1028
01:42:30,708 --> 01:42:32,042
So you have read it.

1029
01:42:32,125 --> 01:42:33,333
No!

1030
01:42:33,667 --> 01:42:37,708
I do not read such filthy stories!
She and her father have read it!

1031
01:42:42,042 --> 01:42:44,208
Call Ms. Rekha.

1032
01:42:44,292 --> 01:42:45,542
Right.

1033
01:42:45,625 --> 01:42:46,750
Jaswant!

1034
01:42:47,583 --> 01:42:49,583
- Ask Ms. Rekha to come here at once.
- Sure.

1035
01:43:49,208 --> 01:43:51,125
This is a wildlife book!

1036
01:43:51,208 --> 01:43:52,208
I have no idea!

1037
01:43:52,292 --> 01:43:53,417
I will fix it.

1038
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:55,000
Where is Ms. Rekha?

1039
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,417
Let me check on her.

1040
01:44:58,208 --> 01:45:00,458
It's no big deal!

1041
01:45:02,583 --> 01:45:05,500
Why in the library?

1042
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,625
I had two fantasies.

1043
01:45:10,042 --> 01:45:11,750
Let me tell you.

1044
01:45:12,458 --> 01:45:14,875
An airplane toilet

1045
01:45:15,167 --> 01:45:17,583
and in a library.

1046
01:45:18,375 --> 01:45:21,667
I fulfilled one fantasy today.

1047
01:45:24,125 --> 01:45:26,458
Men are selfish.

1048
01:45:26,875 --> 01:45:29,083
They cannot make a woman happy.

1049
01:45:29,333 --> 01:45:31,417
We have to do it ourselves.

1050
01:45:31,750 --> 01:45:33,708
And the principal

1051
01:45:34,042 --> 01:45:36,833
took away my happiness
and my husband as well.

1052
01:45:37,125 --> 01:45:38,208
Husband?

1053
01:45:38,458 --> 01:45:39,750
Yes.

1054
01:45:39,958 --> 01:45:42,208
It's always with me.

1055
01:45:42,542 --> 01:45:43,750
It does not talk

1056
01:45:44,167 --> 01:45:46,083
and satisfies me.

1057
01:45:46,542 --> 01:45:48,375
It's the best husband ever!

1058
01:45:50,583 --> 01:45:53,083
Anyway, see you later.

1059
01:46:05,125 --> 01:46:06,542
What happened?

1060
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,208
It's Sunday.

1061
01:47:14,708 --> 01:47:15,792
Hello, Grandma.

1062
01:47:16,083 --> 01:47:19,792
- Have you seen the TV remote?
- No.

1063
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:24,125
Where is it?

1064
01:48:24,833 --> 01:48:25,875
Megha!

1065
01:48:27,208 --> 01:48:30,083
Megha! Something has happened to Paras.

1066
01:48:30,833 --> 01:48:33,750
Sandhya! Get the First Aid kit!

1067
01:48:33,875 --> 01:48:35,208
- Hurry up!
- Does it hurt?

1068
01:48:35,792 --> 01:48:36,667
Paras!

1069
01:48:36,875 --> 01:48:38,583
- Sit beside me.
- Easy, Paras.

1070
01:48:41,750 --> 01:48:42,792
Are you all right?

1071
01:48:42,875 --> 01:48:45,042
Forget about her! How did this happen?

1072
01:48:45,125 --> 01:48:48,750
It was my fault, Mom!

1073
01:48:49,333 --> 01:48:52,458
I felt like she needed me.

1074
01:48:52,542 --> 01:48:56,250
I took a rickshaw
and asked the driver to hurry.

1075
01:48:56,333 --> 01:48:59,708
And we collided with a bull.

1076
01:49:01,833 --> 01:49:05,583
It's my fault.

1077
01:49:06,292 --> 01:49:09,500
The rickshaw toppled, throwing me out.

1078
01:49:10,083 --> 01:49:11,958
I lost consciousness for some time.

1079
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:17,250
People seek light in the dark

1080
01:49:18,042 --> 01:49:19,667
but all I wanted was you.

1081
01:49:20,458 --> 01:49:21,458
Megha.

1082
01:49:22,208 --> 01:49:23,500
Megha.

1083
01:49:24,208 --> 01:49:27,500
Go get him a glass of water!

1084
01:49:27,583 --> 01:49:28,458
Look over here.

1085
01:49:32,417 --> 01:49:35,708
There it is!

1086
01:49:45,250 --> 01:49:48,042
- Take it easy.
- Just blow on it gently!

1087
01:49:58,875 --> 01:50:00,458
Why is this not working?

1088
01:51:39,292 --> 01:51:42,542
- Listen to me...
- Not at all!

1089
01:51:43,125 --> 01:51:46,042
Tell me why we should accept her.

1090
01:51:46,875 --> 01:51:51,333
We'll tell our relatives
that she's epileptic

1091
01:51:51,500 --> 01:51:55,083
to save face.

1092
01:51:59,042 --> 01:52:02,292
Please let's not speak of divorce.

1093
01:52:02,583 --> 01:52:06,083
- I beg you...
- There is no need for that.

1094
01:52:10,292 --> 01:52:15,625
We do not want a child from her.

1095
01:52:15,750 --> 01:52:18,083
Enough, Mom.

1096
01:52:18,708 --> 01:52:20,583
This is between us.

1097
01:52:21,083 --> 01:52:24,292
It would be if it happened in the bedroom.

1098
01:52:24,875 --> 01:52:29,167
But, it didn't,
and so, it's a family matter!

1099
01:52:29,958 --> 01:52:31,625
I have heard enough!

1100
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,875
Don't come home
if you can't live without her.

1101
01:52:37,583 --> 01:52:38,667
Goodbye.

1102
01:52:39,833 --> 01:52:43,458
- Listen to me.
- I don't want to.

1103
01:53:27,292 --> 01:53:29,750
- Sorry for being late.
- It's all right.

1104
01:53:30,750 --> 01:53:32,750
I always arrive early.

1105
01:53:33,042 --> 01:53:35,042
It was the annual day program at school.

1106
01:53:35,125 --> 01:53:36,250
How was it?

1107
01:53:36,917 --> 01:53:38,750
Should we get to the point?

1108
01:53:41,875 --> 01:53:42,917
Megha.

1109
01:53:43,542 --> 01:53:45,625
Let's forget what happened.

1110
01:53:46,375 --> 01:53:48,000
We can start again.

1111
01:53:49,708 --> 01:53:52,375
I apologize for what my mom did.

1112
01:53:52,625 --> 01:53:56,333
But I cannot divorce you.

1113
01:53:58,667 --> 01:54:00,542
- It was just a mistake...
- Paras!

1114
01:54:03,125 --> 01:54:04,958
I didn't make a mistake.

1115
01:54:07,167 --> 01:54:09,125
What happened was not wrong.

1116
01:54:10,875 --> 01:54:16,875
But it shouldn't have happened there.

1117
01:54:20,042 --> 01:54:22,458
Women desire more than just children.

1118
01:54:35,375 --> 01:54:36,667
So

1119
01:54:38,625 --> 01:54:40,167
what have you decided?

1120
01:54:43,125 --> 01:54:44,792
What do you want to do?

1121
01:54:46,417 --> 01:54:48,792
I don't know.

1122
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,542
But for now

1123
01:54:59,167 --> 01:55:01,167
I want some ice cream.

1124
02:00:31,167 --> 02:00:33,333
