Tell me, who is having a bad day today?

63
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,024
We are, Guggi.

64
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:49,157
That too because of our father's third mistake.

65
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,132
Look at that.

66
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,034
<i>T ma'?</i>

67
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,896
Our father's last child?

68
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,873
Why've you kept him hanging like a Tandoori chicken?

69
00:04:56,929 --> 00:05:00,240
He got Bholi's wedding invite yesterday.
- Okay.

70
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,941
He says, "if Bholi gets married to someone else.."
- Yes?

71
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,779
"Then I'll die before the marriage is solemnized."
- Okay.

72
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,409
Now tell me what should I do?

73
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,111
What does her father say?

74
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,088
He said he wouldn't get his daughter married into a family of gangsters.

75
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,118
Catch the tail!

76
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:19,095
Brother, has anyone ever paid heed to a bride's family?

77
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,530
We'll kidnap the girl.
-We can't?

78
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:22,425
Why? Is she heavy?

79
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,058
No, she's an MLA's daughter.

80
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,799
Then it's not possible.

81
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,769
Tota, we'll drop our weapons.

82
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,169
We cannot kidnap an MLA's daughter.

83
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:32,857
Here you go.

84
00:05:32,883 --> 00:05:34,395
Come on, drop your weapons.

85
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,343
Come down.
Cancel your plans to die.

86
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,176
We have quit being gangsters.

87
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:38,806
Come down. - Come down.

88
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,543
Promise me that you'll
talk to Bholi's family..

89
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,013
"About getting us married.

90
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,212
We'll talk.
We'll talk about getting you two married.

91
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:45,255
Come down.

92
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,380
Promise?

93
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,919
We place our hand above a candle flame and promise.

94
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,586
How else can we assure you?
- Come down.

95
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,265
Watch out.
Don't back out on your word.

96
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,962
We won't.
- Okay, I'm coming down.

97
00:05:59,025 --> 00:05:59,935
Come.
- Come down.

98
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,232
Come on. Come on.

99
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,809
Guggi! Chidi! It bit me!
It bit me!

100
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,444
Don't! Don't!
- Save me, you scoundrels!

101
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,462
No! Be careful!

102
00:06:09,488 --> 00:06:10,509
Oh, no!

103
00:06:10,535 --> 00:06:12,235
- Help me!

104
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,415
Get up.

105
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:22,442
- My father's spoilt son..

106
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,219
I, Chidi, am a gangster.
-Yes.

107
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,626
Guggi is a gangster.
-Yes.

108
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,632
Why can't you be a gangster?

109
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,668
Why are you getting into this mess of love?

110
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,225
Forget Bholi, you son of animal!

111
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,293
Don't call father an animal.

112
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,927
- Okay, I won't.
 I won't.

113
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:38,943
Now tell me, should we stop being gangster because of a girl?

114
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,669
Stop being one because of me!

115
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,939
Do you guys love me?

116
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,811
Listen up!
We cannot quit being gangsters.

117
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,908
But we'll get married to Bholi.

118
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,180
What do you mean by "we"?

119
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:49,171
Is she "Draupadi"?

120
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,687
Get her married to me! Just me!

121
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,017
Yes, catch the tail!

122
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,819
We'll get you married.

123
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,359
And if we aren't able to do that then we'll quit being gangsters.

124
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,657
Hey, are you happy now?

125
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,325
Why are you interfering?

126
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,926
Brother Chidi, now I'll handle Bholi and Tota's case.

127
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,045
Rambo, you have to save my honor today.

128
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,140
Karma, one of you will lose honor.

129
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,549
It's either you or your wife.

130
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,622
Because my witness is very carefree.

131
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,053
But who is he?

132
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,598
Begin the court proceedings.

133
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:44,800
Your Honor..

134
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:51,045
"My client Karmo, is a very decent and kindhearted person.

135
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:56,620
But her husband is a very indecorous man.

136
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,815
He is having an affair with another woman.

137
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,152
And in order to get married to her..

138
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,954
...he wants to divorce this naive lady.

139
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:06,829
Objection, Milord.

140
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:10,595
Don't.
You'll get a chance to speak.

141
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,999
Thank you.
- Yes?

142
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,102
What were you saying while praising Karmo?

143
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,572
My husband praises me as well.

144
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,539
You should hear the bad things about this animal.

145
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,414
Madam, this isn't your home.

146
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,866
This is a courtroom.

147
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:23,140
Sorry, Your Honor.

148
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,742
The one who now seeks divorce..

149
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,250
...there was a time when he couldn't stop praising me.

150
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:31,777
You my girl will get me into trouble.

151
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,154
I was right.
All you have done is troubled me.

152
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,625
As if you have taken care of me.

153
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,624
Now I feel like singing this song:

154
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,756
"You'll die a dreadful death as you've betrayed me."

155
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,731
Earlier, you used to wash my feet and drink that water.

156
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,861
You used to say, "Karma, you tastes like a cold drink."

157
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,267
Don't I have the fizz anymore?

158
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,170
How can you ever fall short of it?

159
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,139
You have cylinder for a stomach.

160
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,735
Yes, you dream of setting this cylinder on fire.

161
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,711
Don't worry.
If I blow up, I'll make sure you die with me.

162
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,271
Order. Order. Order.

163
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:01,978
Your Honor, I'm someone who shies seeing her own image in the mirror.

164
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,668
I am such a shy girl.

165
00:09:03,694 --> 00:09:06,173
Karma, how have I betrayed you?

166
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,657
Shall I tell you how you've betrayed me? Shall I?

167
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,124
Wait a minute, Your Honor.

168
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,590
Who is he? Who is he? Who is he?

169
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,957
I'll tell you how Karmo has betrayed Karma.

170
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:16,292
Order. Order.

171
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,235
You can say what you have to in the witness box.

172
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,944
I speak the truth and nothing but the truth.

173
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,012
But with you consider that to be truth, Your Honor?

174
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,679
Order. Order. Order.

175
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,182
This is the custom of this court.

176
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:40,954
A custom or not, but Jassi has never lied.

177
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,218
And he'll speak the truth today as well.

178
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,726
How do you know this girl?

179
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,088
How do I know her?

180
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,062
Ask her how she knows me.

181
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,996
Tell us.
 - But I don't know you.

182
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,832
The witness is warned to come to the point.

183
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,139
Fine. I'll come to the point.

184
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:59,366
Actually, Your Honor, Karma is a very dear friend of mine.

185
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,335
And Karmo is my sister-in-law.

186
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,810
My sister-in-law was losing her reputation in the society.

187
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,281
But there's always darkness under a lamp.

188
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,283
Karma didn't know anything about it.

189
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:13,050
When I told Karma, that she is getting too frank..

190
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,887
That she enters in a new profile every time..

191
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,824
Karma slapped me.

192
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,752
I said, get lost.

193
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:21,723
You want to end our friendship because of a girl.

194
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,324
I'll use my slippers!

195
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,019
- He said the same thing, Your Honor.

196
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,898
Friendship also holds some value, doesn't it?

197
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:33,606
Hence I decide to give my friend a proof of her being characterless.

198
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,043
Now things are coming into light.

199
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,979
I started an affair with my friend's wife.

200
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,606
I went on dates with her.

201
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,276
Can anybody do that?
I did it!

202
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,286
I'll break your jaw!
- Yes.

203
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,686
Your Honor, I don't know this boy.

204
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,122
Now you'll say that you don't recognize this chain.

205
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,087
That you don't recognize this wristlet?

206
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,321
That you don't recognize this ring?

207
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,787
Don't lie, Karmo.

208
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,271
Lie! It's a lie.

209
00:10:55,297 --> 00:10:56,449
He is lying.

210
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,134
Oh really?

211
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:58,759
Then is this mobile phone lying as well?

212
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:03,239
Your Honor, have a look at my photo with Karmo in this mobile.

213
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,433
What nonsense is he talking about?

214
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,974
Is it ever easy to get rid of one's wife? Shut up.

215
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,305
A mobile phone doesn't lie, does it?

216
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:15,141
Ms. Karmo, is that you in this photograph?

217
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,754
Tell me it is you or Ms. Pooja is in the green dress?

218
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,468
Your Honor, it's me.

219
00:11:22,494 --> 00:11:24,809
But how can I be with him?

220
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,446
I'll break this!

221
00:11:26,472 --> 00:11:27,989
- Give it to me.

222
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,864
Break it!
You'd gifted it to me.

223
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,231
From Ludhiana's market.

224
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:38,131
Actually, Your Honor,
I'm as guilty as Karmo about this.

225
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,368
I too should be punished.

226
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:41,491
Punish me!

227
00:11:41,517 --> 00:11:44,171
Punish me!
- Order. Order. Order.

228
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,227
I'm guilty. Punish me! Punish me!

229
00:11:45,253 --> 00:11:46,401
- The witness has lost his control.

230
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,080
Take him outside.

231
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,273
- Why are you sending me out?

232
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:48,928
Arrest me. Punish me.

233
00:11:48,954 --> 00:11:50,312
- So that court can continue the proceeding.

234
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,995
Where are you taking me?

235
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:54,247
Judge uncle.. Punish me, uncle.

236
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,487
If you don't want to punish me then curse me.

237
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,855
Be the producer of my movie!

238
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,266
Don't let me go free.

239
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:01,253
I'm losing it.

240
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,049
Let go of me.

241
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:06,486
Relax. Job's done, right?

242
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,326
Get going now.

243
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,329
Go. - Strange.
- He's strange.

244
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:13,002
Go. Play.
- He was very hyper inside.

245
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,283
"Trouble. Trouble."

246
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:26,080
Amar Singh, if you are the headman of a village..

247
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,391
...then I am not a commoner either.

248
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,895
I'm the elected headman of my village.

249
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,464
Brother, are you scared of Mohan Singh?

250
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,465
Why don't you say something?

251
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,331
Did you have Fevicol for breakfast?

252
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,529
Mr. Mohan Singh, I, too, have been uncontested headman..

253
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,867
...of my village since the last 15 years.

254
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,940
It will be better if you don't interfere in our matter.

255
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,014
What did you say?

256
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,471
I shouldn't interfere?

257
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:51,948
I'm the headman.

258
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,206
And this matter concerns a girl from our village.

259
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,412
I've promised her father.

260
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:59,388
Hence you should have over the girl and the boy to us.

261
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:02,157
Mr. Mohan Singh..
- Brother!

262
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:06,025
You are talking to him as if he is your aunt's son.

263
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,509
Don't be soft.

264
00:13:07,535 --> 00:13:09,181
Be harsh. Harsh.

265
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,325
Mohan!

266
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,529
I too have made a promise to the boy's father.

267
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,205
They love each other.

268
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,299
I suggest either you become a witness..

269
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,140
...to their court marriage or get lost.

270
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,873
You won't get them.

271
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:29,784
I'm always against the kids who marry against their parents' will.

272
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,701
But, Mr. Mohan Singh..

273
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,838
- Harsh, brother. Harsh.

274
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,916
Mohan, then you listen to me!

275
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:40,059
I want to see the tales of Sassi Punnu and Heer Ranjha..

276
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,963
...In a new form in Punjab.

277
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,832
I'm God to those who are in love.
I'm God!

278
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,199
God!

279
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,464
Did I over do it?
- It was great, brother.

280
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:50,939
You were wonderful.

281
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:52,967
'What kind of a father has mother selected?'

282
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,009
'I've told her to change him a number of times.'

283
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:54,840
'But she doesn't.'

284
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,782
The great well-wisher of lovers.

285
00:13:56,808 --> 00:13:58,395
- Why just a well-wisher?

286
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,474
Call him a savior. A savior.

287
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:01,758
I'll see this great savior.

288
00:14:01,784 --> 00:14:03,272
- You can whenever you want to.

289
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,549
I've seen many like you.

290
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,331
I'm not some girl wearing bangles!

291
00:14:06,357 --> 00:14:07,475
- I know many like you!

292
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,756
Bangles! -We'll get you some.

293
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:10,109
- We'll get you some bangles.

294
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,413
He wants to act as their savior.

295
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:12,347
- Let's go. Let's go.

296
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:13,522
Elected headman!
- I've seen many like him.

297
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,624
Let's go. - Bloody whiner.

298
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:21,932
Thank God!

299
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:25,134
Jassi!
You were great!

300
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,337
Brother! - Back off!

301
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,507
Saw how I turned the case that was stuck for six months?

302
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,445
That too with just witness.

303
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,349
What a great lawyer I am.

304
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,012
Hello, mister.

305
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,214
He is the one who is great, not you.

306
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,758
I'm still polishing him.

307
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:47,855
In future he will make Gippy, Diljit, Jimmy run for their money.

308
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,465
I'll make a big film with him.

309
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,335
May no one evil eye cast on him.

310
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,926
Back off!

311
00:14:53,952 --> 00:14:55,329
- Let's go!

312
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:58,965
Calm down.

313
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,493
It's great.

314
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:05,834
I said a few lies, Karmo and Karma got divorced.

315
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,179
And I got Rs. 100,000.

316
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,050
I pray that people like Karma continue to get married.

317
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,488
We'll have our movie ready within a year.

318
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:14,455
Don't forget me.

319
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,424
I'll be playing the chef's role in your movie.

320
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,954
"Trouble. Trouble."

321
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:21,988
They ran away before I could tell them my rate.

322
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,163
What happened now?

323
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,396
Along with his acting gigs..

324
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,038
...your darling son has started giving false testimonies!

325
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,437
That too in court!

326
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,203
Why are you accusing my son?

327
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,207
He must be shooting for a movie.

328
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:35,784
Yes, of course.

329
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,106
As if Mahesh Bhatt is ready with his camera for him.

330
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,448
Why don't you say something?
Speak up.

331
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,077
Do you ever let me speak?
- She talks!

332
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:47,149
If his father was Mahesh Bhatt he didn't have to give auditions.

333
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,158
He would've become an actor on his own.

334
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:50,215
That's simply wonderful!

335
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:51,995
Son is already crazy..

336
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,861
...now even his mother is doing a PhD on Mahesh Bhatt.

337
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,866
Movie business is doing great nowadays.

338
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,534
Give Rs. 50 lakhs to Jassi.

339
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,468
He'll earn you Rs. 20 million.

340
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,362
Rs. 50 lakhs?
-Yes.

341
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:07,236
Do you two know how to count 50 lakhs?

342
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,506
Listen"

343
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:10,918
He is my son.

344
00:16:10,944 --> 00:16:12,165
He should behave.

345
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,381
If he wants I can send him to Canada.

346
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,543
I can open a poultry farm for him..

347
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:19,248
...but I won't even give him Rs. 5 for this stupidity.

348
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,231
Tasty.

349
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,736
Captain, tell me something.

350
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:38,500
Why doesn't your father want you to become a movie star?

351
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,801
He’s jealous of me, brother.

352
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:42,971
Jealousy.

353
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:48,551
You know talented kids like us..

354
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,280
...always have useless parents.

355
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,113
Parents.

356
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:57,684
They don't want to explorer the talent and make their kids famous.

357
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,785
Got it?

358
00:16:58,884 --> 00:16:59,954
But Rambo..

359
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,900
I sometimes feel that my dream to become a hero will never come true.

360
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,072
If I don't become a movie actor"

361
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:11,334
...then I won't be able to get married to Roop.

362
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,975
If I don't get married then how will I have kids?

363
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:22,950
No. Don't get emotional.

364
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:23,884
No.

365
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:26,013
Love, but don't get emotional.

366
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,091
I feel like you aren't high enough.

367
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,092
I'll get another drink for you.

368
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,289
Wait here.
- Get two.

369
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,626
Coming.

370
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,633
He doesn't stop.

371
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:50,780
Rambo, why do you look like Roop?

372
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,944
And this liquor looks like poison.

373
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,353
Jassi, come back to your senses.

374
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,783
I am Roop and I've brought this poison.

375
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,654
Roop? You?

376
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:04,022
You brought poison?

377
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,259
You cannot die.

378
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,914
I cannot live without you.

379
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:10,622
No.

380
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:11,759
Jassi..
-Yes?

381
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,202
I've brought this for you and not me.

382
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,636
Now tell me, how do you wish to die?

383
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,401
By consuming poison but by getting stabbed by me?

384
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,304
What are you doing?

385
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,073
Keep these down.

386
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,210
I love you a lot.

387
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,237
A lot. - Shut up, Jassi.

388
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,750
I am not destined to get love.

389
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:29,877
Who said that?

390
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:35,687
Look, first I'll become a movie star.

391
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:39,090
Then I'll have a lot of money.
- Okay.

392
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,654
I won't have to ask my father for it.

393
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,428
Then I'll build my own house.

394
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,969
Then I'll have a love marriage.

395
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,971
My father cannot stop us.

396
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:52,404
Then we'll have four-five kids.

397
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,076
Here you go.
- Rambo says so.

398
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,761
Correctly.

399
00:18:55,787 --> 00:18:57,431
- Exactly.

400
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,410
Same.

401
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,741
Let it be, Jassi.

402
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,012
You couldn't take me to your house even once.

403
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,417
You don't believe in me?

404
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,020
Give me your ring?

405
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,954
Why?
- Give me your ring.

406
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:08,252
Oh Jassi.

407
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,325
Ladies and gentlemen.

408
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,917
- Jassi, have you lost it?

409
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:14,987
Everyone is looking at us.
What are you doing?

410
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:18,364
I, Jassi,
the super star of tomorrow" - Jassi!

411
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:20,462
In front of everyone I declare..

412
00:19:20,488 --> 00:19:21,952
- What are you doing!

413
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:25,682
That I love my Roop a lot.

414
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,061
- Come on, Jassi.

415
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,977
I love her limitlessly.

416
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,139
Applause.

417
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:46,352
<i>"I said, I love you and I'll wait for you forever."</i>

418
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:57,834
<i>"I said, I love you and I'll wait for you forever."</i>

419
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,735
<i>"Come, let our hearts unite."</i>

420
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:07,214
<i>"Foolish girl says, do you think you are Romeo?"</i>

421
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:11,084
<i>"Foolish girl says, do you think you are Romeo?"</i>

422
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:15,614
<i>"Foolish girl says, do you think you are Romeo?"</i>

423
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:40,047
<i>"She left me because I drink liquor."</i>

424
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:43,946
<i>"Because people say my character is bad."</i>

425
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,816
<i>"Now she keeps blabbering about me."</i>

426
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,718
<i>"To the one she is going around."</i>

427
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:55,397
<i>"He bloody smokes cannabis."</i>

428
00:20:57,222 --> 00:21:01,102
<i>"Foolish girl says, do you think you are Romeo?"</i>

429
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:04,868
<i>"Foolish girl says, do you think you are Romeo?"</i>

430
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,844
<i>"Foolish girl says, do you think you are Romeo?"</i>

431
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,679
<i>"Foolish girl says, do you think you are Romeo?"</i>

432
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,321
Don't worry, captain.

433
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:23,689
You are looking great.
- Really?

434
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,956
Hail Lord Shiva!

435
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,362
May you always have plenty!

436
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,458
Everyone in this world yearns for a child.

437
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,397
They do so many things for their son.

438
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,438
Fulfill your son's dream.

439
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,299
Help him succeed.

440
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:39,205
Attachment to wealth is bad.

441
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:41,005
It always gets you into trouble.

442
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,943
Stop, sage.
I'll get some whole wheat flour for you.

443
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,408
We've a lot of flour, ma'am.

444
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,179
Let us pray for you and help your son succeed.
- Yes.

445
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,448
Sage, tell me something about my son.

446
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:54,283
Your son is very hard working and efficient.

447
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:56,487
But he is getting buttermilk instead of milk.

448
00:21:56,715 --> 00:22:00,993
Yes, your darling son Jassi is wandering.

449
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:01,793
Right, headman?

450
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:04,163
"Trouble. Trouble."

451
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:07,294
Put some of the dust under your husband's feet into fire.

452
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,372
Give some money to Jassi and help that poor boy.

453
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,106
Listen to what the sages are saying.

454
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,139
You are great, sage. You are great.

455
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,075
You know it all.

456
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,347
You have made me realize the truth.

457
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,910
I feel like giving something to you.

458
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:29,322
Make them wait, I'll get something for them from inside.

459
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:30,984
Live long, headman.
Live long.

460
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,357
Well done, captain.

461
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:33,868
You are great, sage.

462
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:34,956
You are great.

463
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,390
Ma'am..
- Yes?

464
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,935
You should keep your husband on a tight leash.
- Okay.

465
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,833
Keep him shackled.

466
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,930
He loves to jump. Like this.

467
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,409
Damn you! What's wrong with you!

468
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:49,776
Wait, sage! Take some more of it!

469
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,371
Jassi, your father is crazy!

470
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,219
They make my blood boil.

471
00:22:54,245 --> 00:22:55,773
- You have lost it.

472
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,252
You have started shooting at sages.

473
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,709
They weren't sages.

474
00:22:58,735 --> 00:23:00,577
It was Jassi and Rambo.

475
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:01,757
She talks!

476
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,259
Oh, my God! Jassi and Rambo!

477
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,421
My son acts so well.

478
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,323
Listen, I think you should give him money to make a movie.

479
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:12,130
If he acts like this then the movie will be a hit.

480
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,898
Eat.
- I don't want to eat.

481
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,098
Go to hell, then!

482
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:19,142
Why don't we leave him at a mental asylum?

483
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:22,979
Mental asylum takes in only those who have lost their mind.

484
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,138
He doesn't have any brains.

485
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,943
You guys won't quit being gangsters.

486
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,566
I won't get Bholi.

487
00:23:27,592 --> 00:23:28,440
I'll die.

488
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:32,250
His record always gets stuck at Bholi.

489
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:36,315
Brother, I'll break all of his records.

490
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:38,486
Look, I've brought Karma.

491
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,394
He's cooking at Bholi's wedding.

492
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,161
He wants to die because of Bholi.

493
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,497
And you have brought a cook to rub salt on his wounds.

494
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:47,798
Catch the tail.

495
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:50,339
Brother, he can get Bholi's wedding cancelled.

496
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,601
Really?

497
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,104
Do one thing. - Yes?

498
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,872
Add a heavy dose laxative in the food..

499
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,970
"That is being cooked for the wedding guests.

500
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:01,015
Guests will eat it and get loose motions.

501
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,177
Guests will run here and there.

502
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,084
Thus Bholi's wedding will be called off.

503
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:08,883
Brother" -Yes?

504
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,120
Loose motions can break a person down but not a marriage.

505
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,822
Then add poison. -Yes.

506
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,160
Everyone will eat poison and die.

507
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:17,325
Thus Bholi's wedding will be called off.

508
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:19,733
Hey, give him a sack full of poison.

509
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:23,935
But brother, what if Bholi eats that food?

510
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:26,874
Hey, make sure that doesn't happen.

511
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,277
Hey, don't let Bholi eat that food.

512
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,212
Even if she has to stay hungry the whole day.

513
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:33,843
Brother, I'm not getting you.

514
00:24:33,869 --> 00:24:35,040
What are you trying to say?

515
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,983
Look, brother, please don't ruin my business.

516
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:41,189
What if I stop this wedding without all this mess?

517
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,485
Catch the tail.

518
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,250
Brother, you shouldn't keep repeating such a lousy dialogue.

519
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,764
If someone actually does that then you'll get into big trouble.

520
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,959
Hey! This is my catchphrase.

521
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:54,868
Okay, brother. But try to catch it before it hurts you.

522
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,837
Someone might come after you because of it.

523
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,100
Rambo..

524
00:24:58,196 --> 00:24:59,800
Get a trim.

525
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,441
You get me ideas from old 1947 movies.

526
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,741
Worn out, useless ones.

527
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:06,178
My father has even watched the movie 'Jism 2', twice.

528
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:07,342
That too in a theater.

529
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:10,784
Captain, don't underground me.

530
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,516
Underestimate. - Whatever.

531
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:16,987
The thing is, you shouldn't worry when Rambo is here.

532
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:19,927
We'll make a new scheme and make you famous.

533
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:22,431
You'll end up excusing yourself.

534
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,394
Father will hit me.

535
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:26,759
Listen up, captain.

536
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,361
Rambo doesn't like three things.

537
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,052
Getting a trim.

538
00:25:31,078 --> 00:25:32,506
Scaring kids.

539
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:35,231
And fearing a thrashing.

540
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,307
Shall I say something?

541
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:40,750
If I don't become a hero then one day..

542
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:43,009
...this headline will surely make it to the newspaper and television.

543
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,281
"Why did Jassi kill Rambo?"

544
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:53,134
It's ringing.

545
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,879
Answer it.

546
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:58,092
Hello?

547
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,191
Who is it?

548
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:01,635
It's Karma, brother Rambo.

549
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,831
Karma?
Who (is that) Karma?

550
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:06,066
Brother, you just help me get divorced.

551
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,405
You forgot me so quickly?

552
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,110
That (much) Karma!

553
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:12,648
How are you, Karma?

554
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,240
Brother Rambo, I've got a deal of Rs. 10 lakhs.

555
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,044
We have to call off a girl's marriage.

556
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,246
10.. 1 O lakhs!

557
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,380
10 lakhs!

558
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,690
Quote 15! - Quote 15!

559
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:23,882
15 lakhs.

560
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,991
15 lakhs! 15..

561
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,195
Not a penny more than 25.

562
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,859
Not a penny more than 25.

563
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,231
Brother Rambo, it's Rs. 25 lakhs.

564
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,769
Shall l finalize the deal at Rs.25 lakhs?

565
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,271
25 lakhs! - 25 lakhs!

566
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,172
Karma, just tell me where do we need to come.

567
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:40,238
At my eatery.

568
00:26:40,264 --> 00:26:41,131
Where else?

569
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:42,941
Come quickly.
Money is ready.

570
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:46,780
Karma is a very helpful guy.

571
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:49,140
"Why do you always want money?"

572
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,483
"Why do you so crazy about money?"

573
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,421
What's this new scheme?

574
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:56,155
Jassi..

575
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:59,194
My hero, you need to get a girl's marriage called off.

576
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,195
We'll get Rs. 25 lakhs.

577
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,698
Consider that you are a hero.

578
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:04,927
You have become a star.

579
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,936
You have got married to Roop.

580
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:09,967
You have two small kids.

581
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:12,166
They will call me, "Uncle Rambo."

582
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:20,443
Talk softly, if you father hears us he will take all the money!

583
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:24,419
"Here comes another trouble!"

584
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:28,051
I've got famous actors married.

585
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:30,286
I fixed Saif and Kareena alliance.

586
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:32,021
They didn't call me after they got married.

587
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:35,496
"Here comes another trouble!"

588
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,894
"Here comes another trouble!"

589
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,469
Hello? Yes, sister?

590
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,130
Yes, I'd sent the green chilies in the omelet.

591
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:44,832
They are complimentary.

592
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,169
Just a minute, sister.

593
00:27:46,195 --> 00:27:47,167
Are you on Facebook?

594
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,711
Sir, you get everyone married.

595
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:53,939
Get me married as well.

596
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:54,973
Here you go, brother.

597
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,314
Nowadays even cycles want an engine.

598
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:01,384
Brother, you end where marriage begins.

599
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:04,790
Suppose I get you married..

600
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:08,160
...tell me how will you lock the door after marriage?

601
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,324
Sir, you just get me married.

602
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:13,369
I'll shift the lock down.

603
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:15,850
Fine, brother.

604
00:28:15,876 --> 00:28:18,557
You will always thank me.

605
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:20,037
Here, choose one.

606
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,410
Sir, this Bhojpuri spice will do.

607
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:25,812
Huh?
Geet?

608
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,042
22 years old.

609
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,106
Thilma village.

610
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:32,349
Brother, you cannot get married to her.

611
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:36,222
Why?
- She is already booked.

612
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:38,124
Really?
- Go and do your job. Go.

613
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:39,319
This alliance also got called off.

614
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,362
I think he got angry.

615
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:42,955
Brother, please come here. -Yes?

616
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,931
It's okay if she is already booked.

617
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,334
You don't worry.

618
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:52,138
I'll give you her photo.

619
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:52,962
Here you go.

620
00:28:52,988 --> 00:28:54,964
Get married to her photo. Go.

621
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:56,501
Fine. - Here you go.

622
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,441
This contains half the amount.

623
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,141
You'll get the other half and the job is done.

624
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:02,774
And here's her photo.

625
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:04,218
Her name and address is written at the back.

626
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:06,027
"I'll get married.

627
00:29:06,053 --> 00:29:07,804
I'll be a groom."

628
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:08,381
Coming.

629
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:10,824
"Trouble. Trouble. Trouble."

630
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,442
Can't you see?

631
00:29:12,468 --> 00:29:14,116
- Forgive me, sir.
Please forgive me.

632
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,191
Give it to me.

633
00:29:15,217 --> 00:29:16,223
- Here you go.

634
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,123
I'm not talking to you.

635
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:19,518
You book the cameras.

636
00:29:19,544 --> 00:29:21,821
It's time for me to become a star.

637
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,501
And I should also take my doctor for shopping.

638
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,545
Let me see what's so special in a girl for whom..

639
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,205
...a person is ready to give Rs. 25 lakhs.

640
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,067
Oh God!

641
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,177
This belongs to us.

642
00:29:58,203 --> 00:30:00,134
It's not someone else's crockery.

643
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:03,044
If you are still not satisfied then break another one.

644
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:06,273
This girl is trouble.

645
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:09,750
This girl will slowly break everything in this house.

646
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,082
But you still didn't get up.

647
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:12,744
Aunt is just too much.

648
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:17,783
Whenever I'm about to finish a scene of my movie, she wakes me up.

649
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:19,853
Look at the traits of this girl.

650
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:20,928
She is getting married day after tomorrow"

651
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,760
...and she dreams of being a movie star.

652
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,864
You'll soon be going to your in-laws' house.

653
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,925
You should learn some mannerism.

654
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:30,105
Your heroines like tantrums won't work there.

655
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:33,106
I'll become a heroine.

656
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:37,178
Anyway, that's the reason I chose this boy from UK.

657
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:41,182
My husband will be the producer and I'll be the heroine.

678
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:46,778
Stupid.

679
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,917
I cannot believe she is getting married.

680
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,596
You don't know her tantrums.

681
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:56,588
She is making everyone crazy.

682
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:58,224
She is getting married..

683
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:02,761
<i>"Henna, my love. Henna."</i>

684
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:06,365

685

<i>"The girl was a cutie."</i>

686
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,709
<i>"Henna improved her beauty."</i>

687
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:16,616
<i>"Henna, my love. Henna."</i>

688
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:19,883
<i>"My love, it dwells in a garden."</i>

689
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:29,223

00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,890

Hello. Welcome. - Hello.

Hello. Hello.

741
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,287
Hello, uncle.
 - Hello. - Hello.

742
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:09,156
Did they exchange the garlands?

743
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,886
They are just about to.

744
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:12,254
<i>O</i> Okay'!!-

745
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:20,901
He got ready for no reason. Stupid.

746
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:28,368
Snacks?
- Yes.

747
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:29,377
Make one for me.

748
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:30,845
Add some yogurt. Yogurt.

749
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:31,779
Let me call him.

750
00:34:31,805 --> 00:34:33,199
Has he reached there or not?

751
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:42,042
Hello, Karma?
- Did you reach there?

752
00:34:42,068 --> 00:34:42,874
Did you break it off?

753
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,339
The snacks are very tasty.

754
00:34:44,365 --> 00:34:46,349
Take an advance booking for my wedding.

755
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:47,954
Forget about the snacks!

756
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:50,021
Tell me, did you reach there?
- Yes, I have.

757
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:51,479
I'm waiting for the girl.

758
00:34:51,505 --> 00:34:52,423
She isn't here as yet.

759
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:54,128
She is here. She is here.

760
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:57,835
She has come?

761
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,000
Brother, don't give them an opportunity to exchange garlands.

762
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,601
Okay?
- Hello? Hello?

763
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:05,614
Hello? Hello? Hello?

764
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,981
Damn the network.
It disappears at critical times.

765
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:20,392
"Here comes another trouble!"

766
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,694
"Here comes another trouble!"

767
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:26,901
"Here comes another trouble!"

768
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,995
Stop, Geet!

769
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:31,073
Stop, Geet!

770
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:33,665
Stop, Geet!

771
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:35,368
You cannot get married to this boy.

772
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,104
You belong to me, Geet. Only me.

773
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:39,839
I shouldn't have come here.

774
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:42,280
I have no right to interfere in your life.

775
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,787
But what else could I do, Geet?

776
00:35:44,813 --> 00:35:46,005
I love you a lot.

777
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:47,363
I cannot live without you.

778
00:35:47,389 --> 00:35:48,810
- Stop your nonsense, boy!

779
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:51,788
Who are you?
- Geet, why don't you say something?

780
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,960
We both will suffer if we get separated.

781
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:55,928
This family will suffer as well.

782
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:57,044
Hey, who is he?

783
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,786
- Geet, do you know him?

784
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,735
No, papa.
I don't know this boy.

785
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:02,497
Oh really?

786
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,798
Now you will say that you don't recognize this chain!

787
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,000
That you don't recognize this wristlet!

788
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,075
That you don't recognize this ring!

789
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,770
Don't lie, Geet.

790
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:10,997
Have you gone crazy?

791
00:36:11,023 --> 00:36:12,405
Have you lost your mind?

792
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:15,345
Papa, I really don't know this boy.

793
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:18,254
All of you think that this is true?

794
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:23,123
Son, whoever you are, you are not doing the right thing"

795
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:23,919
...by doing this drama.

796
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:25,983
Drama? - Enough!

797
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,287
We have been humiliated enough, Mr. Gill.

798
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:31,424
Mr. Sidhu, he is talking nonsense.
 -Yes.

799
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:32,900
We'll call the cops.

800
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:34,334
This is your personal matter.

801
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:35,530
You can handle it however you want to.

802
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,364
You don't need to drag us into it.

803
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:40,375
Dad, Geet and Geet's father are right.

804
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,045
We don't know who he is.

805
00:36:42,071 --> 00:36:43,496
And Geet doesn't lie. -Yes.

806
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,410
Call the cops.

807
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:46,563
Call them. - Stop your nonsense!

808
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:47,544
What are you looking at?

809
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,011
Catch him and throw this lover boy out!

810
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,182
I knew that something like this would happen with me.

811
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:58,050
All lovers are destined to get thrashed in the end.

812
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:02,056
Jassi will die today.

813
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:06,090
But don't you worry, I won't blame you for my death.

814
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,530
I'll go far away from here and then die.

815
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:12,238
But you'll have to endure the news of my death.

816
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,168
This.. Dear..

817
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:15,274
Wow.

818
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,141
Brother?

819
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:19,974
You saw an NRI boy and you killed her desires.

820
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,975
You should've at least thought about her life.

821
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,780
Let's go.

822
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,350
Come on, everyone, let's go.

823
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:27,889
This wedding cannot take place.

824
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,815
Mr. Sidhu. Mr. Sidhu, please stop.

825
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:32,320
Mr. Sidhu, please stop.

826
00:37:32,346 --> 00:37:33,916
For God's sake, please stop.

827
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:35,328
Mr. Sidhu, please stop.

828
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:40,797
Come on, everyone sit back to their respective seats.

829
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,370
'Damn he came here as well!'

830
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,838
Where are you going, son?

831
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:49,948
The wedding got called off.

832
00:37:49,974 --> 00:37:51,871
The guests are leaving.

833
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:54,075
As long as Headman Amar Singh is here..

834
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:57,779
...no wedding can be called off in this village.

835
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,219
What I said was true.

836
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,655
Dad, he must be Geet's old boyfriend.

837
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,120
She must've broken off with him.

838
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:06,021
Such boys do such things at such occasions.

839
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,824
Headman, call the cops.

840
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:10,956
What can my little brother do when Geet and the groom are ready?

841
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,625
Right? - Stop your nonsense!

842
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:16,895
Headman, I cannot make this girl my daughter-in-law"

843
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:21,667
...till we don't find whether this boy is telling the truth or lying.

844
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:23,937
Will you just keep listening to them?

845
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,912
Will you say something or has the cat caught your tongue?

846
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,415
That's what I am saying.

847
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:30,685
Why do we need the cops when I am here?

848
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:32,345
This matter is related to a girl.

849
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:33,596
This boy wanted to die.

850
00:38:33,622 --> 00:38:35,074
He can die after two hours.

851
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,956
Take the guests to the guesthouse"

852
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:39,790
...and lock this lover boy at the village square.

853
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:41,192
Listen up, everyone.

854
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:46,129
No one should leave this village till we don't decide upon this.

855
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:58,010
Who is this scoundrel?

856
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:02,084
He ruined our honor.

857
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:03,851
Strange!

858
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:06,481
In the ad they show that you'll get network in hell as well.

859
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:08,885
There isn't a single bar of network at the village square.

860
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,331
I won't spare this scoundrel.

861
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:18,094
I'll expose his lie before everyone.

862
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,693
Brother, today, I realized that there are such kinds of lovers as well.

863
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,966
Scoundrel, are there different categories of lovers?

864
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:26,172
Hello, brother?
- Life is a party, lovers..

865
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:29,767
Is anyone there? Someone please let me make a phone call.

866
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,282
Don't worry. We'll get you married.

867
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:35,974
I don't want to get married.

868
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,247
Do you wish to stay single all your life, like Vajpayee?

869
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:45,217
Stay awake!

870
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:53,895
Rambo, you got me killed!

871
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,866
God, send me a savior.

872
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,524
I asked for a savior and you sent the death messenger.

873
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:58,995
-What did you say?

874
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,040
Why are you getting hyper?

875
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:01,974
Is your phone working?

876
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,305
My phone?
It's with my best man.

877
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,904
Brother, I want to ask you something.

878
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:10,282
What?
- Is there something between you and Geet?

879
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:13,083
Did you come here to ask that?
- What else!

880
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:15,350
Listen to me.

881
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:18,093
If there wasn't something between Geet and me..

882
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,126
...then wouldn't I have left after having desserts?

883
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:23,088
You are lying. -You mean I am lying?

884
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:26,099
If you weren't lying then why would Geet be getting married to me?

885
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:30,601
Well, brother, the thing is, Geet is getting married to you..

886
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:33,164
...only because she respects her father a lot.

887
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:33,935
Really?

888
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,944
Her father is against love marriages.

889
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,807
Brother, you'll have to make a sacrifice.

890
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:41,647
We'll get married if you run away.

891
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,979
Don't you want two lovers to unite?

892
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:45,524
I want that to happen.

893
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,273
- Then what are you doing here?

894
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,948
Go.
- Right.

895
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,252
Tomorrow I'll tell everyone that they should get Geet married to you.

896
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:52,658
He is such a big fool.

897
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,024
Brother, who has seen tomorrow?

898
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:54,994
Why don't you run away right now?

899
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:56,224
Your honor lies in that.

900
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:57,631
You are right.

901
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:59,133
But brother, take good care of Geet.

902
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,361
I'll take good care of her, brother.

903
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:01,796
Okay?
- I'll take good care of her.

904
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,031
Go, brother. Go.
 - Okay. Okay.

905
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,768
No, they don't get along with their family as well.

906
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:12,747
Yes. - Stay awake!

907
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:22,213
Hello, Rambo?

908
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:24,232
Yes, got a ladder.

909
00:41:24,258 --> 00:41:25,682
I'm just about to get down.

910
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,186
What are you doing over here?

911
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:30,092
You love me?
- No.

912
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:32,167
You want to marry me?
 - Not at all!

913
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:34,132
But you want to die, right?
Then die!

914
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,434
Let go of me!

915
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:39,930
You!

916
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:40,923
Have you lost it?

917
00:41:40,949 --> 00:41:42,262
What if you've hurt me?

918
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:43,572
Who are you?

919
00:41:43,598 --> 00:41:45,065
What are you doing here?

920
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:46,972
I'm here at the behest of your lover.

921
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:48,277
He is my friend.

922
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,117
Which lover are you talking about?

923
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:51,150
Okay!

924
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,118
There are options available here as well..

925
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,018
...like who wants to be a millionaire!

926
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:55,114
I'll give you a tight slap.

927
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,721
I don't have any lovers.
Got it?

928
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:00,255
I don't believe in love.

929
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,830
I'm taking about Tota.

930
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,762
Tota? Who is that?

931
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:05,877
Brother, lift the stick.

932
00:42:05,903 --> 00:42:07,019
Let me call him.

933
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:08,934
Yes. Okay.
Call him. Come on.

934
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:13,208
Here, your boyfriend is calling.

935
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:16,006
Yes? - Hello?

936
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,177
Yes, the marriage got called off, brother.

937
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:20,215
She is standing before me and threatening me.

938
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:22,284
Whose marriage did you call off?

939
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:24,316
Bholi got married.

940
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:26,752
Whose marriage did you call off?

941
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:28,086
Huh?

942
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:31,920
Now see how sister Guggi..
- Hey!

943
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:34,991
Now see how brother Guggi break your legs.

944
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,833
"Trouble! Trouble! Trouble!"

945
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:40,269
Now tell me.

946
00:42:40,295 --> 00:42:42,325
Why don't you say something?

947
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,071
Well, you make a mistake sometime.

948
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:48,106
I made a big mistake by mistake.

949
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,642
I'll stop the groom.

950
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:50,896
I'll stop him right away.

951
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:53,906
You made Sandy run away?

952
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:56,151
I'll kill you!

953
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:59,127
I'm here.
I'll set everything straight.

954
00:42:59,153 --> 00:43:00,105
Don't worry.

955
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:01,854
Come with me.

956
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:08,918
Shall I start the engine?

957
00:43:08,944 --> 00:43:10,053
- No, not yet.

958
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,157
We are still not out of the village.

959
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:15,260
Dad, please talk to Geet.

960
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:16,831
I think the boy is lying.

961
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:18,669
I'll give you a tight slap.

962
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:20,069
The whole village came to know.

963
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:22,474
You have met him and yet you praise her.

964
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,404
I don't believe it.

965
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:24,466
l feel she is a nice girl.

966
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:28,681
If the villagers wake up then they will tie us down over here.

967
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:31,386
Don't worry.
I'll stop them.

968
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,722
Look there they are.

969
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:38,452
Hello, Mr. Groom?

970
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:40,487
The villagers are coming!
We are dead!

971
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:42,492
Who is it?
- Quickly get into the car!

972
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:43,974
Come on. Come on. Get in.

973
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,780
Hurry up! Run!

974
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:46,061
Hit the gas!

975
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,394
They are running away?

976
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:49,495
Come on. Let's go.

977
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:50,997
"Here comes another trouble!"

978
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:52,301
Hello? Brother?

979
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:53,773
Stop!

980
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:56,739
What's happening over there?

981
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:58,141
They are running away!

982
00:43:58,167 --> 00:44:00,306
Geet and the boy are running away!

983
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:03,284
"Here comes another trouble!"

984
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:08,485
Mr. Groom! Stop! Sundy!

985
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:09,724
Sandy!

986
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,522
Sandy!
- This mess has been created by you.

987
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:14,375
Now I won't spare you.

988
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:15,281
I'll kill you.

989
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:15,924
What do I do?

990
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:17,346
He isn't hitting the brakes!

991
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:19,094
Mr. Groom!

992
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:29,534
Okay. I've brought both of them before you.

993
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:34,374
But I request everyone not to say anything to them.

994
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:36,108
Just get them married quickly.

995
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,413
"Trouble. Trouble."

996
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:44,323
Geet, even after your mother's death I never made you miss her.

997
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:47,828
Still you hid all this from me?

998
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:51,092
It's of no use to beat around the bush, brother-in-law.

999
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:53,359
Shoot this ill-fated one!

1000
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:55,404
We'll shoot someone for sure, ma'am..

1001
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:59,969
"But only the one who speaks against those who are in love.

1002
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:01,509
I don't love him.

1003
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:04,510
Papa, please listen to me.

1004
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:07,412
I cannot take a single step against your wishes.

1005
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:10,475
Headman is mistaken.

1006
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:13,246
We weren't running away, papa.

1007
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,187
You were playing hide and seek.
-Yes.

1008
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:18,317
But you didn't think that you'll get caught.

1009
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:19,824
I'm talking to my father.

1010
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:20,977
Please keep quiet.

1011
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:22,391
Shut up, Geet.

1012
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,321
Don't act smart.

1013
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:28,062
If you would've told me, I would've got you married to this boy.

1014
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:30,871
You don't need to worry, brother-in-law.

1015
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:32,565
Send her off with this loafer.

1016
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:34,369
How can you just send her off with me?

1017
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:36,306
He is right.

1018
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,347
It's wrong to send off just like that at such an auspicious hour.

1019
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,449
We'll get you two married and send her off with pomp and show.

1020
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:43,627
Why do you worry?

1021
00:45:43,653 --> 00:45:45,102
- Try to understand.

1022
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:46,292
I don't even know her.

1023
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:47,840
I don't want to get married.

1024
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:50,217
I was here to break this alliance at someone's behest.

1025
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:52,825
Look, let bygones be bygones. -Yes.

1026
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:54,055
You can hand me over to the cops.
- Yes, do that.

1027
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:55,927
Or you can hang me upside down at the village square.

1028
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:56,623
Hang him.
 - But don't get me married.

1029
00:45:56,854 --> 00:46:00,028
Wow, son.
You are very good at this.

1030
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:03,162
He says he had come here to break the alliance.

1031
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:08,337
Why do you need to feel scared when you love each other?

1032
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:12,278
Nowadays it's hard to find true love.

1033
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:13,847
He's a goon.

1034
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,159
Papa, how can I love a goon?

1035
00:46:16,185 --> 00:46:17,136
- Shut up.

1036
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:20,484
Aunt, he had come to call off someone else's marriage.

1037
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:22,219
Why don't you say something?

1038
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,029
What do I say?

1039
00:46:23,055 --> 00:46:24,875
No one is ready to listen to me!

1040
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:29,163
Hello! Stop this drama!

1041
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:34,100
When everything has been decided then why are you ruining it?

1042
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,438
All the arrangements have been made.

1043
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,632
The band is ready.

1044
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:40,204
We just need to begin.

1045
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,243
If you say, I'll go and start it.

1046
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:44,640
I said that I cannot get married to her!

1047
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:47,212
I'll die but I won't get married to her.

1048
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:51,876
Look at the sacrifice they are making.

1049
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:56,254
The girl is lying because of her father's honor.

1050
00:46:56,413 --> 00:47:01,123
And the boy is ready to sacrifice is love for the girl's honor.

1051
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:04,692
Who says that there's no more love left in Punjab?

1052
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:06,296
They are the Romeo and Juliet of this generation.

1053
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:07,027
How do I explain it to them?

1054
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:08,967
Uncle, why are you making schemes..

1055
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:10,367
...when I'm not interested in getting married?

1056
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:11,531
Enough!

1057
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:15,339
The decision made by the village council is final.

1058
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,476
Mr. Gill, you make preparations for the wedding.

1059
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:19,148
It is not possible.

1060
00:47:19,174 --> 00:47:20,301
- I'll see who stops it. - Papa..

1061
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:21,074
Let's go, boys.

1062
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,602
- Uncle.. Uncle, listen to me.

1063
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:23,208
Papa, please.

1064
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:24,417
You have been played.

1065
00:47:24,443 --> 00:47:26,404
Now we just need to play the band.

1066
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:28,390
I'll break it!
- Don't break it!

1067
00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:29,449
Don't break it!

1068
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:36,454
"We are a flock of birds."

1069
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:41,298
"Father, one day we will all fly away."

1070
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:48,635
"Hair on the groom's forehead shine bright."

1071
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:51,304
He is looking good.

1072
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:53,481
We are the only ones representing his family.

1073
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,929
Let's not waste a lot of time.

1074
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:55,974
We have a lot to do.

1075
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:57,076
Come on, boys. Come on.

1076
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,677
His teeth"
- What are you doing!

1077
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:01,115
I don't want to get married.

1078
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,690
"The color of henna is red.."

1079
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:05,158
We won't let you fight the battle of love alone.

1080
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:06,990
Apply the paste on him.
Apply it.

1081
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,223
Apply- Apply!

1082
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:16,170
"Hair on the groom's forehead shine bright."

1083
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,534
You look good in a turban, brother.

1084
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:21,367
Why don't you tie it?

1085
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:23,411
Why are you getting upset?

1086
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:26,380
Do you have a pin? - Go get a pin.

1087
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:29,078
He won't get it.

1088
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,377
Just a minute.
I'll go get it.

1089
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:33,739
Brother, he won't find it.

1090
00:48:33,765 --> 00:48:34,836
Why don't you go and get it.

1091
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:36,015
Okay, I'll get it. Stay here.

1092
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,456
I am here.
Where will I go?

1093
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:40,835
What do they know?

1094
00:48:40,861 --> 00:48:42,382
One can tie a turban without any pins.

1095
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:43,464
Run, Jassi.

1096
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:52,501
You should keep it on the side.

1097
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:54,371
You might fire it by mistake.

1098
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:57,105
If I don't keep it in my hand during a wedding..

1099
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:58,578
...then what's the use of keeping it with me.

1100
00:48:58,802 --> 00:48:59,906
"Here comes another trouble!"

1101
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,415
"Here comes another trouble!"

1102
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:05,282
'He's carrying the revolver as if it is a Tata Docomo phone.'

1103
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:06,525
'They are screwed.

1104
00:49:06,551 --> 00:49:08,242
Now they want to screw me.'

1105
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,856
'I wanted to be a film star.

1106
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:11,290
They bloody made me a groom.'

1107
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:28,305
Now I'm getting the network as well.

1108
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:29,400
Hello, uncle.

1109
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,410
Hello, captain.

1110
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:32,269
Since when am I your uncle?

1111
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:33,940
They got me married.

1112
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:36,077
Now father won't let me enter the house.

1113
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,812
Which movie's dialogues are you saying?

1114
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:40,385
The one you directed at Karina's behest.

1115
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:42,915
Guggi and Chidi are its producers.

1116
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:45,516
What?
- This is its pre-climax.

1117
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:47,922
Now where do I go with the bride?

1118
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:51,228
You have shocked me by saying that.

1119
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:54,132
Tell me, uncle.
-What can we do?

1120
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:55,726
Do one thing.

1121
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,330
You bring them to the mansion used for shootings.

1122
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:01,375
Brother, he is planning to run away?

1123
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:02,676
No. Don't worry.

1124
00:50:02,702 --> 00:50:05,268
His parents must be against it.

1125
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,246
This society is very narrow-minded.

1126
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:10,848
But we are happy, aren't we, that Geet and Jassi got married.

1127
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:11,942
Then what!

1128
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:13,744
Who will play my parents?

1129
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,790
I'll do something.

1130
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:18,917
Congratulations on your wedding, brother.

1131
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:20,465
Don't worry, son.

1132
00:50:20,491 --> 00:50:22,850
I'll convince your parents.

1133
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:26,457
How will they refuse when we'll take all the villagers with us?

1134
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:27,762
They'll surely accept it.

1135
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:29,964
My parents have gone out.

1136
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,864
They won't return for quite some time.

1137
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:36,135
I can take her home only when they return and we convince them.

1138
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:38,776
In the meanwhile we'll have to stay at my uncle's place.

1139
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,476
It's okay, son.

1140
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:43,008
Uncle's house is as considered as an in-laws' house.

1141
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:43,948
It's not a problem.

1142
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:45,350
That's fine, brother-in-law.

1143
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:47,319
But I was wondering that our girl is going..

1144
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,152
...to her in-laws' house for the first time.

1145
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:50,554
How can we send her alone?

1146
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:52,350
Someone from the family should accompany her.

1147
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:53,690
Why don't you go?

1148
00:50:53,716 --> 00:50:55,888
- No way! I won't go there.

1149
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:57,159
You should be grateful that I attended the wedding.

1150
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:58,562
Her aunt has a lot of other things to do.

1151
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:00,427
Master, why do you worry?

1152
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:03,232
If she isn't going then we'll send Pooja.

1153
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,967
She will have company and get some help in the household chores.

1154
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:08,976
Okay, send Pooja.

1155
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:18,752
What are you doing over here?

1156
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:19,684
Send Pooja.

1157
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:23,886
I'm Pooja.

1158
00:51:23,947 --> 00:51:25,221
"Pooja!"

1159
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:28,186
Stop. Stop it.

1160
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,962
So much money to be a father?

1161
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:32,897
One can get a real father in that much money.

1162
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:34,991
We'll be sending him back after four days.

1163
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:37,668
Please do something.
Yes. Yes.

1164
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:38,933
Come on. Get in.

1165
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:43,608
Karma, who is this animal?

1166
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:45,476
Hey.
- She's sister Guggi.

1167
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:48,079
Brother, you should've kept a manly name.

1168
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:51,616
Now how can anyone address someone
named Guggi or Chidya as brother?

1169
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:54,521
Karma, who are they?

1170
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,917
Tell him. - The Bholi case.

1171
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:04,699
You should say such things sooner.

1172
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:06,078
Please have a seat.

1173
00:52:06,104 --> 00:52:08,050
- No, we are better off standing.

1174
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:10,867
Now we'll sit on your joints, my boy.

1175
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:13,000
Catch the tail.

1176
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:16,805
We'll sit on his joints only if we leave any intact.

1177
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,243
Hear him talk.

1178
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:20,778
Okay, brother.
Please come here.

1179
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:22,282
Tell me..
- Yes?

1180
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:25,316
How would you like to die?

1181
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:29,680
Brother, I would like to die slowly, by growing old.

1182
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:31,051
Stop joking.

1183
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:33,819
Tell me, would you like to die alone..

1184
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:35,261
...or along with your hero Jassi?

1185
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:40,667
What should I say?
- Tell him.

1186
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:45,070
Hey, mister!

1187
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,070
You want me to grow a mustache?

1188
00:52:47,096 --> 00:52:48,634
But I already have one.

1189
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:50,905
Don't joke with me.

1190
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,036
No, no.

1191
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:54,844
You think you are a goon? - No.

1192
00:52:54,938 --> 00:52:57,248
I'm a bigger goon than you are.

1193
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:01,186
I've spend six months in one..

1194
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:04,817
...no, many prisons.

1195
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:06,588
And you are acting smart with me?

1196
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,095
Go and catch the Jassi who took the money from you..

1197
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:10,358
...and did the deal with you.

1198
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,580
I wonder what's wrong with him.

1199
00:53:11,606 --> 00:53:12,318
- Get lost from here.

1200
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,583
You didn't tell me.

1201
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,596
He is such a notorious goon.

1202
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:21,144
Brother Guggi, my eatery is in a mess.

1203
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:22,266
Please let me go.

1204
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:23,710
Fine, you may leave.

1205
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:25,337
Okay. - Okay. Okay.

1206
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,153
Come on. Get down.

1207
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:38,210
- Just a minute. Just a minute.

1208
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,161
You said that we'll be going to your paternal uncle's house.

1209
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:43,028
Do you think this is my maternal uncle's house?

1210
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:44,695
It belongs to my paternal uncle.

1211
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,581
- Okay, now he has started talking.

1212
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,966
He has become informal.

1213
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,829
It's okay.
It's okay.

1214
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:51,198
This is your house.

1215
00:53:51,224 --> 00:53:52,830
Go and call your aunt.

1216
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:55,739
We'll first perform the ritual and then get inside.

1217
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:57,938
Let your aunt perform the rituals.

1218
00:53:58,001 --> 00:53:59,639
Do you have to compulsorily talk?

1219
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,884
I mean if aunt is compulsorily needed..

1220
00:54:02,939 --> 00:54:05,579
...then she will have to live in the jeep.

1221
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:08,747
Will you call out for your aunt or should I?

1222
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:10,655
Aunt!

1223
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:12,625
Your voice won't reach her.

1224
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,585
Aunt died 20 years ago.

1225
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,667
Very sad. Very sad.

1226
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:21,998
Do one thing.

1227
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,149
Call your uncle.

1228
00:54:23,175 --> 00:54:24,825
Or he too followed her?

1229
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:28,900
Actually the priest has asked uncle not to look at a newly wed couple.

1230
00:54:28,965 --> 00:54:30,273
Uncle is a widow-man.

1231
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:33,140
Son, there is no such thing as widow-man.

1232
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:39,049
You should say he is a widower.

1233
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,588
Okay, you can leave now. Goodbye.

1234
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:42,282
How can you say goodbye just like that?

1235
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:45,853
Pooja has to guard every moment.

1236
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:47,403
Your uncle leaves her.

1237
00:54:47,429 --> 00:54:48,345
I'm getting out.

1238
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:50,729
Who will get the luggage of your new wife?

1239
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:53,729
God, it's so dirty.

1240
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:04,968
"Cast off the evil, oh groom's mother.."

1241
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:09,339
"Pooja!"

1242
00:55:09,606 --> 00:55:10,880
What is it, son?

1243
00:55:10,906 --> 00:55:12,976
You dropped her luggage.

1244
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:15,421
Go inside. I won't go inside.

1245
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:22,059
"The bride and the groom are standing outside."

1246
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:23,324
'He is trouble.'

1247
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,229
'Now how do I get rid of him?'

1248
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:31,671
Hey, stop right where you are.

1249
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:33,306
Whom did you ask before coming inside?

1250
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:35,765
And whom did you ask before locking the door?

1251
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,904
Look Geet, I know you were betrayed before of me.

1252
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:42,010
But everything happened against my wishes as well.

1253
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:51,416
All the rooms are locked as if the Swiss bank has shifted here.

1254
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:54,458
You don't need to give me any justifications. Got it?

1255
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:57,398
Does this mansion belong to your uncle?

1256
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,728
Who said that?
- You.

1257
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:01,162
You said so.

1258
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:03,396
I said that fearing your family.

1259
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,796
This is a mansion where shootings take place.

1260
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:08,037
Lies. Lies. Lies.

1261
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:10,169
I wonder how many more lies you will tell me.

1262
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,404
You've ruined my life.

1263
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:15,075
Look, I, too, wasn't dancing to the music played by the DJ.

1264
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:17,310
The one because of whom I broke your marriage..

1265
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:20,715
...his brothers are after my life.

1266
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:22,043
I cannot go home.

1267
00:56:22,069 --> 00:56:23,813
I cannot face my parents.

1268
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:26,678
Let's do one thing.

1269
00:56:26,704 --> 00:56:28,381
- Hey, don't come close to me.

1270
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:30,429
And we won't do anything together.

1271
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:34,333
I just want to get out of all this mess.
Got it?

1272
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:40,140
Mr. Groom, where will Pooja sleep?

1273
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,233
All the rooms are locked.

1274
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,472
Go stretch your legs on the sofa outside.

1275
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,146
Please do not disturb us.

1276
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:53,743
Look, don't worry.

1277
00:56:53,769 --> 00:56:55,141
I'll do something.

1278
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:57,958
Look, now we can get out of this mess only by getting a divorce.

1279
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:00,426
I'll prepare the divorce papers.

1280
00:57:00,452 --> 00:57:01,646
Please support me.

1281
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:03,526
Do whatever you want to, quickly.

1282
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:04,928
But get out of here.

1283
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:07,092
Brother.
 -What is it?

1284
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:09,163
I want to drink water.

1285
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,252
So, do you think you'll get it in here?

1286
00:57:10,278 --> 00:57:10,828
Go and drink it outside.

1287
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,568
There's no Bisleri factory outside.

1288
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:15,734
There's no water in the toilets as well.

1289
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:18,108
Your family seems to be in a mess.

1290
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:19,509
Damn you.

1291
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:24,849
You are still standing over here?

1292
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:26,216
Why don't you leave?

1293
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,150
Please don't misunderstand me.

1294
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:29,947
I, too, am feeling suffocated over here.

1295
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:31,549
I've a lot of tension.

1296
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:34,459
Look, I love Roop.

1297
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:37,657
I cannot have any one other than her in my life.

1298
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:43,399
Oh, so you love someone.

1299
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:45,804
And yet, you break other people's marriages.

1300
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:47,306
Is this your character?

1301
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:50,335
Now I don't trust you at all, Jassi.

1302
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,174
Look, listen to me.

1303
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,462
- I know that you are a liar.

1304
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:55,378
But I don't know how bad your character is.

1305
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:56,584
I'll do one thing.

1306
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:57,810
I'll introduce you to Roop.

1307
00:57:57,841 --> 00:57:59,013
She'll tell you everything.

1308
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:01,013
If you get my character certificate from here..

1309
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:03,284
...you will believe in me, right? Okay?

1310
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:06,552
Hello?
- "Pooja!"

1311
00:58:07,283 --> 00:58:09,729
Why doesn't anyone inquire about Pooja?

1312
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:14,668
There's some grumbling..

1313
00:58:15,859 --> 00:58:19,636
...noise coming from my stomach.

1314
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:22,001
I think I'm hungry.

1315
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:24,675
Hunger?
Yes, I'm hungry.

1316
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:26,576
Who will feed us?

1317
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:27,545
Go outside and have it.

1318
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:29,742
Do you have a cook waiting outside?

1319
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,646
I'll have chili chicken.

1320
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:33,525
Come with me.

1321
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:34,741
I'll give you chili chicken.

1322
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:36,069
What will you have, sister?

1323
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:36,907
- Come with me.

1324
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:39,517
Peas and potatoes or pea pilaf?

1325
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:40,924
Your mother is sitting outside to feed you.

1326
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:42,861
Or should I get spinach and cottage cheese for you?

1327
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:44,921
I'll get roasted potatoes.

1328
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,329
Here..

1329
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:47,628
You lift it again!

1330
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,328
I said, keep your hands here.

1331
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:50,798
Here..

1332
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:53,692
He is a notorious goon.

1333
00:58:53,718 --> 00:58:54,892
- No, no, no.

1334
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:57,774
Neither am I a goon nor was my father ever a goon.

1335
00:58:57,834 --> 00:59:00,940
Brother, I am a coward.

1336
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:05,009
I just got a little hyper and threatened you.

1337
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:07,011
I was just acting.

1338
00:59:07,037 --> 00:59:08,410
Just acting.

1339
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,586
Brother? -Yes?

1340
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:15,355
I swear, I don't know where my hero is.

1341
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:20,097
Hey, will we eat over here?

1342
00:59:20,156 --> 00:59:21,829
Then do you want me to take you to a five star restaurant?

1343
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,241
It's okay. Fine.
I'll manage.

1344
00:59:23,267 --> 00:59:23,918
I'll manage.

1345
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,067
What are you doing?

1346
00:59:25,093 --> 00:59:26,898
- Cutting onions.
- Hurry up.

1347
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,603
Looks like a nice restaurant.

1348
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:32,411
Looks like the hero is calling.

1349
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,071
Talk to him on speaker phone.

1350
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,017
If you act smart.

1351
00:59:36,043 --> 00:59:38,169
- Then we'll shoot you.

1352
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:41,382
Catch the tail!

1353
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:43,418
Who will provide the arms?

1354
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:45,887
We'll kill him with a knife.

1355
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:47,860
Hello? Where are you?

1356
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:48,608
Where are you?

1357
00:59:48,634 --> 00:59:50,115
- Are you on vibration mode?

1358
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:51,564
Why is your voice quivering?

1359
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:54,633
Tell him that you are drinking.
-Yes.

1360
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,597
I'm drinking, captain.

1361
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:59,037
I thought Guggi and Chidi got you.

1362
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:03,543
How can they dare to even touch me!

1363
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:05,442
Where are you?

1364
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:06,809
I'm at Sethi's restaurant.

1365
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:08,743
To eat.
- He's here.

1366
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:10,674
Who was that?

1367
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:12,693
It was me.
 I'm happy.

1368
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:13,842
You are here?

1369
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:15,082
You too are here?

1370
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:18,019
Then come over, we'll drink together.

1371
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:19,323
Just one drink.

1372
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:21,884
I've to take food for the one who is at home.

1373
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:23,680
Come over quickly then.

1374
01:00:23,706 --> 01:00:25,717
Okay?
We'll drink together.

1375
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:28,035
Hello, sir.

1376
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:29,798
Hi.

1377
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,167
Please order.

1378
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:33,134
What lentils have you made?

1379
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:34,470
Black lentils.

1380
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:37,361
Please give me, one plate of that.

1381
01:00:37,387 --> 01:00:38,867
- Black lentils.

1382
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:40,652
Spinach and cottage cheese.

1383
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:41,801
Cottage cheese with gravy.

1384
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:43,249
Creamy cottage cheese.
- Creamy cottage cheese.

1385
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,043
Cottage cheese and peas.
- Cottage cheese and peas.

1386
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:47,247
And kidney beans.
 - Kidney beans.

1387
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,479
I don't want these.
- You don't?

1388
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:50,335
Yes, I don't.

1389
01:00:50,361 --> 01:00:53,518
Chili chicken, Tandoori chicken and butter chicken.

1390
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:54,856
I want these for sure.

1391
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:55,929
Two plates of each.

1392
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,157
Come on, Rambo.
You are drinking!

1393
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:58,755
I am dying out here, my friend.

1394
01:00:58,855 --> 01:01:01,631
Come here, hero, we'll give you a large slug.

1395
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:02,761
"Trouble. Trouble. Trouble."

1396
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,065
'From where should I start?'

1397
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,696
'You'll have to stay in this haunted house..

1398
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:07,742
...till you don't get divorced, Geet.'

1399
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:09,532
'Get up.
What are you waiting for?

1400
01:01:09,558 --> 01:01:10,263
Stan working.'

1421
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:16,011
Hello?

1422
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:20,748
Hello, ma'am. It's me, Pooja.

1423
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:22,718
It's been more than an hour.

1424
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:26,317
I cannot find your husband-type guy.

1425
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:28,789
He's not missing. He'll come back.

1426
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:30,457
Who has the food?

1427
01:01:30,483 --> 01:01:34,087
- I've packed the food since an hour.

1428
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:35,864
Then you come back.

1429
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:38,582
No, I need to still pay for it.

1430
01:01:38,608 --> 01:01:40,996
I don't have any money on me.

1431
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,775
Then run away from there.

1432
01:01:42,801 --> 01:01:44,127
Don't disturb me.

1433
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,523
Hello?
Sister?

1434
01:01:46,549 --> 01:01:50,399
Sister!
Sister, please!

1435
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,783
Look, kiddo, he is leaving.

1436
01:01:52,842 --> 01:01:54,150
"Pooja!"

1437
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:57,417
Sir, money?
- I'm not running away!

1438
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,102
I'll pay. Listen up, boy.

1439
01:01:59,128 --> 01:02:00,151
- Hey, go there.

1440
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:01,685
Yes, coming.
- Take this.

1441
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:03,989
Give it to me.
- They think that"

1442
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:06,861
Come on, quickly carry this too.

1443
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:08,162
Sorry.

1444
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,396
Keep it over here.

1445
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:11,866
Okay, I'll keep it.
- Keep it.

1446
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:13,668
Okay, sir.
Give it to me.

1447
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,209
Slowly.
Be careful.

1448
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:19,076
Listen packaged drinking water"

1449
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,783
What is it called?

1450
01:02:19,809 --> 01:02:21,140
Bisleri. - packaged drinking water.

1451
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:23,459
Go and get Bisleri water bottles.

1452
01:02:23,485 --> 01:02:24,108
- Okay.

1453
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:28,082
Four..
No, get a box of them.

1454
01:02:28,144 --> 01:02:29,282
Okay.
- Get a box of them.

1455
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:31,072
But listen, it should be cold.

1456
01:02:31,098 --> 01:02:32,249
Very cold. - Okay.

1457
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:32,986
Okay? - Okay.

1458
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:35,893
Now go. Get a box of them.
Cold. -Yes.

1459
01:02:38,154 --> 01:02:40,395
Give me a box.
- What box?

1460
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:43,674
Of Bisleri.
-You needed to take money from him.

1461
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:44,424
He is leaving.

1462
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:49,167
Keep a bottle over his head.

1463
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:52,179
Half?
 - Catch the tail!

1464
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,275
Do you have to say it in English?

1465
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:56,817
Yes.
- Can't you say it in Punjabi?

1466
01:02:56,873 --> 01:02:58,147
Please calm down, brother.

1467
01:02:58,173 --> 01:02:59,936
Why are you troubling poor people?

1468
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:01,387
Not here.

1469
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:04,321
Hold it.
- Good luck.

1470
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:06,588
Thank you.
- Okay.

1471
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:12,189
Keep a quarter over his head.

1472
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:15,159
Why?
 Now who is talking in English?

1473
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:16,328
Couldn't he have said it in Punjabi?

1474
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:17,959
He is my elder brother.

1475
01:03:17,985 --> 01:03:19,165
He can say whatever he wants to.

1476
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:20,299
Give it to me.

1477
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:22,073
Keep it.

1478
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:24,844
Captain.
-Yes?

1479
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:26,174
Don't take such a risk.

1480
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:27,612
Give me a chance, brother.

1481
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:29,047
You can take all the money today itself.

1482
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:30,981
Please spare us, brother.
Please spare us.

1483
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,611
Please.
- We don't want the money.

1484
01:03:33,776 --> 01:03:38,225
We want Bholi, the girl our younger brother likes.
- Yes.

1485
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:40,989
Here you go.

1486
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:42,857
This is Bholi's husband's photo.

1487
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:43,567
Give it to me.

1488
01:03:43,593 --> 01:03:44,981
He'll make a mistake, again.

1489
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:45,726
You'll get us killed, captain.

1490
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:50,703
Within 7 days either get them separated or kill Bholi's husband.

1491
01:03:51,761 --> 01:03:52,950
Take this.
Have some food.

1492
01:03:52,976 --> 01:03:54,392
- Get me some poison instead!

1493
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:58,111
My son is missing and he wants me to eat!

1494
01:03:58,734 --> 01:04:00,338
Do you want to die by starving?

1495
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:02,272
How many times have I told you that he must've run off..

1496
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:04,783
...to Mumbai in order to get into the film industry.

1497
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:08,781
Keep wandering around when I and my son die.

1498
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:11,188
From where do I get your darling son?

1499
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:13,118
You don't need to look for him.

1500
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:15,753
Ask the doctor.
She knows everything.

1501
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,162
Go and meet her at least once.

1502
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:26,098
Dear, I'd like to meet Dr. Roop.

1503
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:28,104
Okay. That's her.
-Yes. Dr. Roop.

1504
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:30,642
Hello, dear. - Hi.

1505
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:32,640
I'm Jassi's father.

1506
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,611
Uncle, let's go and talk in my cabin.

1507
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:37,014
No, dear.

1508
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:38,848
It's okay out here.

1509
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:40,866
What is it, uncle?

1510
01:04:40,892 --> 01:04:42,381
You look worried.

1511
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:45,684
It's something to worry about.

1512
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,359
Jassi hasn't come home since many days.

1513
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:51,529
We are worried about him.

1514
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:53,890
Do you know where he is?

1515
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,731
Answer it or I'll throw it away.

1516
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:03,174
Throw it.
Who will be missing me anyway?

1517
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:05,409
Roop?

1518
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:07,405
Hello, Rambo?

1519
01:05:07,431 --> 01:05:08,869
- It's Jassi.

1520
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,976
Jassi, you? Where are you?

1521
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,379
Are you concerned about anyone at all?

1522
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:14,887
What happened?
- When are you coming home?

1523
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,613
Do you know about your mother?

1524
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:19,156
No, I don't.
But how do you know about her?

1525
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:22,693
Jassi, I won't answer any of your questions. Just come home.

1526
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:26,861
Roop! Roop!

1527
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:32,203
The crooked dog's tail which I could never straighten"

1528
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:35,805
...she did it in a single phone call.

1529
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:40,113
That's why I say that I really like my daughter-in-law.

1530
01:05:40,636 --> 01:05:41,842
We won't need a doctor as well.

1531
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:43,508
She's do our check-ups.

1532
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:47,411
Here you go. Here comes the emperor.

1533
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:50,521
'Jassi, come on, now you are in a new mess.'

1534
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,990
'She met your mother and your father too.'

1535
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:54,526
'Now the old man won't spare you.'

1536
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:56,657
My son is back.

1537
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,762
Jassi, where have you been?

1538
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:01,434
What have you done to yourself?

1539
01:06:01,657 --> 01:06:04,661
Mother, some people are used to lying.

1540
01:06:04,727 --> 01:06:07,139
That's why they get beaten up as well.

1541
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:09,169
I think something similar has happened with him.

1542
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,912
Right, dad?

1543
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:13,479
You are right, dear.

1544
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:15,871
What you sow is what you reap.

1545
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:17,745
I'm sure he got beaten up somewhere.

1546
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:19,681
You'll never think of anything good for me.

1547
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:22,519
Mother, you know how hard one has to work to make a movie, right?

1548
01:06:22,578 --> 01:06:24,148
Yes.
- You have to work hard day and night.

1549
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,925
That's what your son was doing.
- Right.

1550
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:28,154
Son, you don't need to work so hard.

1551
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:28,836
You make a movie.

1552
01:06:28,862 --> 01:06:30,244
Your father will give you the money.

1553
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:31,659
Yes. - He agreed?

1554
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:32,925
When did I say so?

1555
01:06:32,951 --> 01:06:34,055
- Did I ask you?

1556
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:34,898
Just like that.

1557
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:36,810
Listen to me very carefully.

1558
01:06:36,836 --> 01:06:38,555
I really like this girl.

1559
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:42,167
I'll find an auspicious hour and fix their wedding date.

1560
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:44,210
Don't stop me.
- Why will I stop you?

1561
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:46,640
By the way, even I like her.

1562
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:56,883
<i>"Your beauty has killed me."</i>

1563
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:59,483
<i>"I've lost everything I had, my love."</i>

1564
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,429
<i>"Your beauty has killed me."</i>

1565
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:07,593
<i>"I've lost everything I had, my love."</i>

1566
01:07:07,656 --> 01:07:09,658
<i>"I'm crazy about you."</i>

1567
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:11,727
<i>"I'm dying without you."</i>

1568
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:13,932
<i>"You are my sweetheart."</i>

1569
01:07:13,996 --> 01:07:16,033
<i>"Please come with me."</i>

1570
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:18,977
<i>"Let's enjoy our youth."</i>

1571
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:23,142
<i>"My love, take me someplace far away."</i>

1572
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:27,585
<i>"My love, let me take you someplace far away."</i>

1573
01:07:27,643 --> 01:07:33,093
<i>"My love, take me someplace far away."</i>

1574
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:35,220
<i>"Baby!"</i>

1575
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:41,693
<i>"Baby!"</i>

1576
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:50,735
<i>"Your love is ruling my head."</i>

1577
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:58,843
<i>"Your love is ruling my head."</i>

1578
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:03,114
<i>"It's making me choose paths which are different from all."</i>

1579
01:08:03,212 --> 01:08:05,192
<i>"My hearts yearns for you, my love."</i>

1580
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,591
<i>"Come close to me."</i>

1581
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:10,186
<i>"Your beloved yearns for you."</i>

1582
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:14,564
<i>"My love, let me take you someplace far away."</i>

1583
01:08:14,623 --> 01:08:18,867
<i>"My love, let me take you someplace far away."</i>

1584
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:24,571
<i>"My love, let me take you someplace far away."</i>

1585
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:46,522
Tell me something.

1586
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:48,826
Do you have to take him with you everywhere?

1587
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:50,765
Who?
 Ms. Pooja.

1588
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,329
Headman uncle said that he'll come with me.

1589
01:08:53,395 --> 01:08:54,738
Introduce me whoever you want me to.

1590
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:56,673
Get down then.
I'm not catching your legs.

1591
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,408
He thinks he is great!

1592
01:08:59,001 --> 01:08:59,976
Okay. I'm ready too.

1593
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:00,733
I'm ready too.

1594
01:09:00,769 --> 01:09:02,806
I'm coming.
I'm done.

1595
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:05,085
Just a minute.
Where are they?

1596
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:07,977
In which shop are they?
Son-in-law?

1597
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:09,681
Son-in-law?

1598
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:14,588
Geet, neither can you stay with me, nor can I stay with you.

1599
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:16,990
I've no interest in you.

1600
01:09:17,553 --> 01:09:18,475
Actually, Roop is my life.

1601
01:09:18,501 --> 01:09:19,990
My parents too have given their consent.

1602
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:21,899
We are getting married over soon.

1603
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:25,594
'Oh really?
He called off my wedding.'

1604
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:28,972
'Now how eager he is to get married!'

1605
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:32,479
'I too was wondering why he is so happy.'

1606
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:34,981
'He's banging the table like fools.
Bloody monkey.'

1607
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,854
Why are you telling me?

1608
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,042
Who is stopping you?

1609
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:42,919
You thought that I'm lying about Roop as well.

1610
01:09:43,412 --> 01:09:44,789
Today, I'm going to introduce you to her.

1611
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:48,025
After meeting her sign on the divorce papers.

1612
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:49,522
We'll see.

1613
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:50,762
<i>Jessi.</i>

1614
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:54,467
Roop is here.
Hi, Roop. - Hi.

1615
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:57,862
'Okay.
So she is the one.'

1616
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:02,580
Roop.
She is Geet.

1617
01:10:02,606 --> 01:10:04,136
Geet, she is Roop.

1618
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:06,435
We love each other a lot.

1619
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:09,572
Not just my love, Jassi is my life.

1620
01:10:09,598 --> 01:10:10,737
- So sweet.

1621
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:13,945
I cannot live without him even for a moment.

1622
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:17,115
Oh! So she is Roop.

1623
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:19,524
The one who is after you.

1624
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:21,826
Who said so?

1625
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:25,688
You did.
There is a witch after you.

1626
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:27,199
She wants to marry you.

1627
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:30,469
Because of whom we secretly got married.

1628
01:10:30,759 --> 01:10:33,035
What did I say that? - Witch?

1629
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:34,868
Jassi, what kind of a joke is this?

1630
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:38,167
Geet, I don't like such kind of jokes.

1631
01:10:39,001 --> 01:10:41,607
Roop, I swear on God.

1632
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:43,474
I don't even know her that well.

1633
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:45,516
Oh really?

1634
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:48,782
Then you will that you don't even recognize these earrings.

1635
01:10:49,211 --> 01:10:50,884
You don't recognize this chain.

1636
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:52,787
You don't recognize this ring.

1637
01:10:53,882 --> 01:10:56,123
Jassi, why are you so scared of her?

1638
01:10:57,119 --> 01:10:59,502
Look madam, we are married.

1639
01:10:59,528 --> 01:11:01,115
We are a couple.

1640
01:11:01,724 --> 01:11:04,671
Now I am his love and his wife.

1641
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,502
Now stop having those feeling of love for him.

1642
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:09,474
"Trouble.
Trouble." - Jassi? Marriage?

1643
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:12,478
She is lying.
- Then tell her what I mean to you.

1644
01:11:13,135 --> 01:11:15,945
Geet, what new drama is this?
- Drama?

1645
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:18,807
Apologize to Roop?
 - Apologize?

1646
01:11:18,874 --> 01:11:19,852
I should?

1647
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:21,649
To this witch?
Never!

1648
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:23,656
Look Geet..
- Enough!

1649
01:11:24,013 --> 01:11:25,117
Enough, Jassi.

1650
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:28,954
Did you call me here to insult me?

1651
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:31,891
Roop, please listen to me.
- Congratulations.

1652
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:35,697
Enjoy your married life and your crazy wife.

1653
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,837
Don't show me your face again.
- Roop!

1654
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,538
There's no door to get inside.

1655
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:44,872
Inside..

1656
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:46,575
Crazy girl!

1657
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:48,512
Roop!

1658
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:49,514
That hurts! - Roop!

1659
01:11:49,571 --> 01:11:52,279
This.. Now I will get in.

1660
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:55,254
'You ruined my life, right?'

1661
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:58,724
'Don't call me Geet if I don't make your life a mess.'

1662
01:11:58,781 --> 01:12:01,261
'Now I'll see which girl enters into your life.'

1663
01:12:07,093 --> 01:12:08,071
Roop!

1664
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:09,662
You shouldn't have just walked out of there.

1665
01:12:09,995 --> 01:12:12,134
She was the one who joked and you think it is my mistake.

1666
01:12:12,665 --> 01:12:13,609
A joke?

1667
01:12:13,966 --> 01:12:16,276
Do you think marrying a girl is a joke?

1668
01:12:17,903 --> 01:12:19,155
Marriage?
With Geet?

1669
01:12:19,181 --> 01:12:20,807
Have you lost your mind?

1670
01:12:21,507 --> 01:12:22,747
She was acting.

1671
01:12:23,142 --> 01:12:25,620
Okay.
So you considered her lie to be true.

1672
01:12:25,646 --> 01:12:26,740
This is the limit.

1673
01:12:27,113 --> 01:12:29,889
Jassi, stop covering up your mistakes.

1674
01:12:30,549 --> 01:12:32,859
I knew that you are not serious.

1675
01:12:33,018 --> 01:12:35,862
But I'd never even dreamt"

1676
01:12:35,955 --> 01:12:38,868
"that you'd cheat me.

1677
01:12:38,958 --> 01:12:40,960
At least listen to me.

1678
01:12:42,194 --> 01:12:44,037
Please listen to me.

1679
01:12:44,563 --> 01:12:48,101
When I told Geet that Roop and I love each other a lot..

1680
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:52,840
She told me that I can end your love with a single drama.

1681
01:12:52,972 --> 01:12:54,713
True. I swear.
Foolish girl.

1682
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,114
Roop. Roop. Roop.

1683
01:12:57,176 --> 01:12:58,883
This is what I had told Geet as well.

1684
01:12:59,512 --> 01:13:01,150
You must be an actor to the world.

1685
01:13:01,714 --> 01:13:03,022
My Roop wouldn't believe you.

1686
01:13:04,316 --> 01:13:07,263
And then we had a bet.
And I lost.

1687
01:13:07,319 --> 01:13:08,821
Don't fool me, Jassi.

1688
01:13:09,054 --> 01:13:11,227
You are fooling me with your foolishness.

1689
01:13:12,024 --> 01:13:14,868
If you'd had just one held my hand and confidently said..

1690
01:13:14,927 --> 01:13:19,103
"That "Jassi belongs to me and no one else.."

1691
01:13:19,298 --> 01:13:20,800
I would've won the bet.

1692
01:13:21,767 --> 01:13:23,337
You ruined my confidence in you.

1693
01:13:24,236 --> 01:13:27,945
You believe in the girl you've met for the first time in your life.

1694
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:29,751
And you consider my truth to be a lie.

1695
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:32,914
You have made Jassi from a hero to a zero.

1696
01:13:33,813 --> 01:13:36,555
Jassi, are you seriously telling the truth?

1697
01:13:38,083 --> 01:13:39,653
Can I ever lie before you?

1698
01:13:40,119 --> 01:13:41,063
Oh shit.

1699
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:42,699
I wanted you.

1700
01:13:43,222 --> 01:13:45,259
Now I won't let Geet stay in the movie.

1701
01:13:45,558 --> 01:13:46,901
I'll get her out of it.
-Why?

1702
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:48,732
What's her fault?

1703
01:13:48,994 --> 01:13:50,701
She gave her 100%.

1704
01:13:51,831 --> 01:13:54,744
If I can believe her..

1705
01:13:55,301 --> 01:13:58,043
...then she will make the audience go crazy.

1706
01:13:58,604 --> 01:14:00,811
No, Jassi.
You cannot throw her out of your movie.

1707
01:14:00,906 --> 01:14:02,249
I'll come to meet her at the shooting.

1708
01:14:02,341 --> 01:14:04,116
That way my doubts will also get cleared.

1709
01:14:04,376 --> 01:14:05,592
This is not possible.

1710
01:14:05,618 --> 01:14:07,007
- You are lying to me?

1711
01:14:07,079 --> 01:14:08,353
It is possible.
Why can't it be possible?

1712
01:14:08,581 --> 01:14:09,116
I'm just joking.

1713
01:14:09,181 --> 01:14:09,921
"Trouble.

1714
01:14:09,982 --> 01:14:11,052
Geet will be the film star.

1715
01:14:11,884 --> 01:14:13,363
Where are you?

1716
01:14:13,586 --> 01:14:15,807
Brother, please save my life.

1717
01:14:15,833 --> 01:14:17,058
- How are you?

1718
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:19,164
You are back, captain.

1719
01:14:19,592 --> 01:14:21,731
Did you get into another trouble?

1720
01:14:21,794 --> 01:14:23,671
No trouble, this time I've revolved a trouble.

1721
01:14:23,929 --> 01:14:25,738
Make me a drink.
- Give him a drink.

1722
01:14:26,365 --> 01:14:30,404
She thinks she is my wife.
- Who? - Geet.

1723
01:14:30,736 --> 01:14:33,342
The feeling should be.. Brother!

1724
01:14:36,642 --> 01:14:39,179
Captain, behind you.

1725
01:14:39,745 --> 01:14:41,315
Bholi's husband.

1726
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:44,190
No. Earlier too we got into trouble because of the photo.

1727
01:14:44,717 --> 01:14:45,787
Confirm it.

1728
01:14:45,885 --> 01:14:46,727
Yes.

1729
01:14:46,819 --> 01:14:48,059
Alright.

1730
01:14:50,756 --> 01:14:52,895
Hello, brother.
- Hello.

1731
01:14:52,992 --> 01:14:55,029
Hi. -Hi.

1732
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:59,646
Brother, are you Bholi's husband?

1733
01:14:59,672 --> 01:15:03,070
- Yes.
I'm her husband.

1734
01:15:03,936 --> 01:15:05,065
Do you have a problem?

1735
01:15:05,091 --> 01:15:06,271
- No, no. No problem.

1736
01:15:06,338 --> 01:15:09,080
Brother, I just needed the information for general knowledge.

1737
01:15:09,341 --> 01:15:11,192
Did you get it?
- Yes. Enjoy. Enjoy.

1738
01:15:11,218 --> 01:15:11,937
- Leave now.

1739
01:15:12,011 --> 01:15:15,015
Give him a drink.
- Strange.

1740
01:15:15,147 --> 01:15:19,118
Everyone here knows that I am Bholi's husband.

1741
01:15:19,184 --> 01:15:20,390
Same to same.

1742
01:15:20,853 --> 01:15:22,332
He is really the same person.

1743
01:15:22,421 --> 01:15:26,258
Man, I'm a little confused.

1744
01:15:26,284 --> 01:15:29,125
Let's "inform" it.

1745
01:15:29,461 --> 01:15:31,998
It's "confirm".
- Yes, confirm. It's same.

1746
01:15:32,064 --> 01:15:34,010
Let's go. Let's go.

1747
01:15:37,836 --> 01:15:41,943
Brother, we wanted to confirm something with you.

1748
01:15:42,007 --> 01:15:43,042
Tell me.

1749
01:15:43,742 --> 01:15:46,263
Our MLA, Mr. Nachhatar Singh.

1750
01:15:46,289 --> 01:15:48,113
His daughter Bholi..

1751
01:15:48,147 --> 01:15:52,061
You are surely her husband?
Timmy? Mr. Timmy?

1752
01:15:52,751 --> 01:15:55,103
Yes. Yes.
Yes. Timmy.

1753
01:15:55,129 --> 01:15:57,025
Bholi's husband.

1754
01:15:57,051 --> 01:15:59,184
MLA's son-in-law.

1755
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:03,197
Hello.
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

1756
01:16:03,262 --> 01:16:04,504
Listen to me.

1757
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:05,485
I'm Timmy.

1758
01:16:05,511 --> 01:16:07,419
Husband of Bholi.

1759
01:16:07,466 --> 01:16:09,564
No, I'm Tommy.

1760
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:11,837
Bholi's Tommy.

1761
01:16:13,372 --> 01:16:16,751
It's okay.
Enjoy. - Sit over here. Sit. - Sit.

1762
01:16:16,842 --> 01:16:18,844
Sit over here.
- Sit.

1763
01:16:18,911 --> 01:16:20,219
Sit down, my friend.

1764
01:16:20,312 --> 01:16:22,724
You are our brother, you fool.

1765
01:16:22,781 --> 01:16:24,351
Give a drink to my younger brother.

1766
01:16:24,416 --> 01:16:25,952
Brother, please don't get angry.

1767
01:16:26,752 --> 01:16:28,288
You got married.

1768
01:16:29,154 --> 01:16:31,725
Why?
- Because I didn't get married.

1769
01:16:32,091 --> 01:16:34,367
I really love Bholi a lot.

1770
01:16:34,727 --> 01:16:36,104
She is my life.

1771
01:16:36,195 --> 01:16:37,936
She's a beauty queen.

1772
01:16:40,432 --> 01:16:43,072
An angel.
My dream girl.

1773
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:47,376
My Bholi.

1774
01:16:50,776 --> 01:16:52,756
I cannot live without her.

1775
01:16:56,515 --> 01:16:58,825
For real?
- Yes, brother.

1776
01:16:59,184 --> 01:17:00,690
Let me tell you.

1777
01:17:00,716 --> 01:17:02,315
She and captain"

1778
01:17:02,421 --> 01:17:04,992
I mean my hero, she and Bholi..

1779
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:08,294
Sister-in-law Bholi and he as like Romeo and Juliet.

1780
01:17:08,527 --> 01:17:12,441
You came between them.

1781
01:17:14,166 --> 01:17:16,942
Sure, brother?
- 100%, brother.

1782
01:17:17,002 --> 01:17:18,982
You love Bholi?
-I love her a lot.

1783
01:17:19,772 --> 01:17:21,843
You won't deny it later?

1784
01:17:22,508 --> 01:17:24,010
Don't get angry, brother.

1785
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:32,326
Bholi is soon going to join your family!

1786
01:17:33,419 --> 01:17:35,194
They found Bholi.

1787
01:17:35,788 --> 01:17:37,790
They found Bholi.
- They found Bholi.

1788
01:17:50,536 --> 01:17:52,812
How are you, Pooja?

1789
01:17:53,572 --> 01:17:56,018
What were you doing?

1790
01:17:57,276 --> 01:17:58,380
Pooja..

1791
01:18:02,448 --> 01:18:03,825
Scoundrel!

1792
01:18:03,882 --> 01:18:06,863
Don't abuse me or I'll break your head with this umbrella.

1793
01:18:06,952 --> 01:18:08,522
I didn't abuse you, brother.

1794
01:18:08,854 --> 01:18:10,993
I called you brother-in-law.

1795
01:18:11,056 --> 01:18:12,399
Then it's okay.

1796
01:18:12,491 --> 01:18:14,994
Hey, you are drunk.

1797
01:18:15,094 --> 01:18:16,334
That too without me?

1798
01:18:16,495 --> 01:18:17,735
You too have some.

1799
01:18:17,761 --> 01:18:19,000
What's the issue?

1800
01:18:20,933 --> 01:18:25,040
Geet is..
- Do you have some snacks with you?

1801
01:18:25,137 --> 01:18:27,319
Forget it.
What should I tell you?

1802
01:18:27,345 --> 01:18:29,269
She is like a sister to you.

1803
01:18:35,247 --> 01:18:36,487
Wife..

1804
01:18:38,884 --> 01:18:40,158
You are drunk?

1805
01:18:40,252 --> 01:18:42,323
No. Who said so?

1806
01:18:42,554 --> 01:18:44,192
You want to be my wife, right?

1807
01:18:44,990 --> 01:18:46,663
Come, I'll make you my wife.

1808
01:18:47,025 --> 01:18:48,995
Look, you are drunk.

1809
01:18:49,021 --> 01:18:51,089
- I'm in my senses.

1810
01:18:51,663 --> 01:18:52,869
You are not in your senses, Jassi.

1811
01:18:52,931 --> 01:18:54,968
I'm in my senses.
 I'm awake.

1812
01:18:55,067 --> 01:18:56,671
You don't know what you are saying.

1813
01:18:57,469 --> 01:18:58,374
You are my wife.

1814
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,474
I am your husband.

1815
01:19:01,006 --> 01:19:02,952
So do I take this as a no?

1816
01:19:03,342 --> 01:19:05,322
You don't want to be my wife?

1817
01:19:08,213 --> 01:19:11,697
Rambo, your idea worked.

1818
01:19:11,723 --> 01:19:14,189
She got scared.

1819
01:19:14,419 --> 01:19:16,660
I scared her, brother.

1820
01:19:17,022 --> 01:19:20,094
You scared her.

1821
01:19:20,559 --> 01:19:22,129
I scared your sister, brother.

1822
01:19:22,194 --> 01:19:25,280
Whose sister did you scare?

1823
01:19:25,306 --> 01:19:27,134
- Your sister.

1824
01:19:27,499 --> 01:19:29,256
But Pooja is all alone.

1825
01:19:29,282 --> 01:19:30,733
He has no family.

1826
01:19:30,936 --> 01:19:33,382
Excuse me, listen"

1827
01:19:34,039 --> 01:19:35,074
You said that?

1828
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:37,620
Jassi, please come in.

1829
01:19:37,676 --> 01:19:39,087
Did you say that?

1830
01:19:40,179 --> 01:19:41,351
You are drunk.

1831
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:43,125
I'll go and check.

1832
01:19:43,215 --> 01:19:44,558
You are drunk.
- Enjoy.

1833
01:19:45,150 --> 01:19:47,721
You are drunk.
 - I scared her.

1834
01:20:10,242 --> 01:20:12,222
What's this?
- Wife.

1835
01:20:12,511 --> 01:20:14,320
Whose wife?
- Yours.

1836
01:20:14,513 --> 01:20:16,049
I don't have a wife.

1837
01:20:16,148 --> 01:20:16,956
Where are you going?

1838
01:20:17,015 --> 01:20:18,961
It took my just five minutes to get ready.

1839
01:20:19,017 --> 01:20:22,294
You got angry so quickly, my darling husband.

1840
01:20:24,089 --> 01:20:25,113
I was just joking.

1841
01:20:25,139 --> 01:20:27,584
I wanted to know if you get scared or not.

1842
01:20:27,659 --> 01:20:29,229
But you scared me instead.

1843
01:20:29,294 --> 01:20:30,500
What's there to get scared in it?

1844
01:20:30,562 --> 01:20:32,064
We are husband and wife, right?

1845
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:33,145
That's not real.

1846
01:20:33,171 --> 01:20:34,692
You are joking, right?

1847
01:20:34,766 --> 01:20:36,095
No, I'm serious.

1848
01:20:36,121 --> 01:20:38,364
- You've made me serious.

1849
01:20:38,503 --> 01:20:40,005
You sleep. I'm going.
- Listen to me.

1850
01:20:40,072 --> 01:20:42,074
Listen to me, my darling husband.

1851
01:20:42,174 --> 01:20:43,346
At least have the milk.

1852
01:20:45,444 --> 01:20:46,375
What is it?

1853
01:20:46,401 --> 01:20:48,177
You look very happy.

1854
01:20:48,547 --> 01:20:51,994
Are you in love with Bholi?

1855
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:54,428
No, mom.
Don't say that. - Why?

1856
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:57,792
You know sometimes what you say comes true.

1857
01:20:58,323 --> 01:21:00,496
If I really fall in love with her then..

1858
01:21:01,693 --> 01:21:02,715
No, son.

1859
01:21:02,741 --> 01:21:06,827
Your mother's name is Saraswati.

1860
01:21:07,065 --> 01:21:09,773
I won't let that happen.

1861
01:21:10,035 --> 01:21:16,680
Without any side effect, l found a way to get rid of Bholi.

1862
01:21:16,742 --> 01:21:18,085
Really? - Yes.

1863
01:21:18,176 --> 01:21:19,314
H ow?

1864
01:21:20,045 --> 01:21:22,753
I found Bholi's lover.

1865
01:21:24,283 --> 01:21:27,355
His name is Jassi and he loves Bholi.

1866
01:21:27,452 --> 01:21:29,728
We'll make Bholi and Jassi..

1867
01:21:31,456 --> 01:21:32,298
...elope.

1868
01:21:32,624 --> 01:21:36,572
Then I'll see what dad and his law does.

1869
01:21:39,064 --> 01:21:42,671
So the mother-son duo is making such schemes.

1870
01:21:42,768 --> 01:21:44,475
Yes.

1871
01:21:44,670 --> 01:21:46,445
Listen to me very carefully.

1872
01:21:46,538 --> 01:21:49,849
Such schemes won't work here.

1873
01:21:50,075 --> 01:21:51,179
Listen to me.

1874
01:21:51,243 --> 01:21:54,156
What's my fault if her lover met me?

1875
01:21:54,246 --> 01:21:56,248
You are lying.
- Oh really?

1876
01:21:56,348 --> 01:22:00,194
Fine then.
Tomorrow come with me and see it for yourself.

1877
01:22:03,522 --> 01:22:04,694
There's the zoo.

1878
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:06,269
Guggi, Chidi and crow.

1879
01:22:06,758 --> 01:22:07,634
"Chidi. Chidi.
Chidi."

1880
01:22:07,693 --> 01:22:10,299
Why are you guys coming alone?

1881
01:22:10,395 --> 01:22:11,339
Where is Bholi?

1882
01:22:11,396 --> 01:22:13,162
Sir, Bholi is inside.

1883
01:22:13,188 --> 01:22:14,868
We'll get her out.

1884
01:22:15,067 --> 01:22:17,411
Shall we make Tota meet Bholi?
 - No.

1885
01:22:17,469 --> 01:22:18,777
You guys wait here at the gate.

1886
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:21,214
I'll go inside and get Bholi.

1887
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:24,685
I'll shoot them if they mess anything up inside.

1888
01:22:25,210 --> 01:22:26,120
Let's go, decimal.

1889
01:22:26,211 --> 01:22:26,746
"Chidi. Chidi. Chidi."

1890
01:22:26,812 --> 01:22:27,688
Dad.
- Yes? What?

1891
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,218
You wait here.
- Okay.

1892
01:22:29,781 --> 01:22:32,387
I'll go find Jassi.
- Okay.

1893
01:22:32,451 --> 01:22:34,429
Hey.
You'll go find him.

1894
01:22:34,455 --> 01:22:36,185
Quietly stand here.

1895
01:22:36,221 --> 01:22:37,894
Do as I say.
Got it?

1896
01:22:38,123 --> 01:22:40,694
But dad, I..
- Shut up. Fool.

1897
01:22:40,892 --> 01:22:42,337
Okay, fool.
 - What did you say?

1898
01:22:42,427 --> 01:22:44,532
Dad..
-What a child I have.

1899
01:22:44,896 --> 01:22:47,103
Being a gangster is our side business.

1900
01:22:47,199 --> 01:22:49,201
Our main business is of making movies.

1901
01:22:49,301 --> 01:22:51,281
The thing is if you invest some money in making movies..

1902
01:22:51,336 --> 01:22:53,179
...then our hero..

1903
01:22:56,274 --> 01:22:57,514
Oh no.

1904
01:22:57,776 --> 01:22:58,584
Come here.

1905
01:23:01,113 --> 01:23:02,524
What's this lawyer doing here?
-Where?

1906
01:23:02,614 --> 01:23:03,718
Back there.

1907
01:23:05,851 --> 01:23:07,194
What's he doing here?

1908
01:23:07,285 --> 01:23:08,752
This looks fishy.

1909
01:23:08,778 --> 01:23:10,416
Call him, captain.

1910
01:23:10,455 --> 01:23:11,283
'What a mess.

1911
01:23:11,309 --> 01:23:13,154
There's a lawyer with him.'

1912
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:15,661
Your phone's ringing.

1913
01:23:16,228 --> 01:23:17,332
Oh.

1914
01:23:18,463 --> 01:23:19,271
Hello?

1915
01:23:19,331 --> 01:23:20,810
What's this lawyer doing with you?

1916
01:23:21,833 --> 01:23:24,337
This is the limit.

1917
01:23:24,363 --> 01:23:26,170
I'm his son.

1918
01:23:27,305 --> 01:23:29,080
That lawyer is your old man?

1919
01:23:29,141 --> 01:23:30,149
Old man?

1920
01:23:30,175 --> 01:23:32,443
I call him dad.

1921
01:23:32,511 --> 01:23:34,149
Give it to me.

1922
01:23:34,346 --> 01:23:37,816
Listen, your father must be an old man.
Got it?

1923
01:23:38,083 --> 01:23:40,144
Listen, Bholi is with us.

1924
01:23:40,170 --> 01:23:42,147
Come immediately. Yes.

1925
01:23:42,287 --> 01:23:44,164
I've been watching you.

1926
01:23:44,389 --> 01:23:45,205
Bholi is not with you.

1927
01:23:45,231 --> 01:23:46,121
Tell me, where is she?

1928
01:23:47,225 --> 01:23:48,332
Bholi is in the car.

1929
01:23:48,358 --> 01:23:50,129
The car is in the parking lot.

1930
01:23:50,162 --> 01:23:52,142
Parking lot is outside the mall.

1931
01:23:52,597 --> 01:23:53,473
Anything else?

1932
01:23:53,532 --> 01:23:56,172
If she is in the car then tell me the car's license plate number.

1933
01:23:56,568 --> 01:23:58,570
CH-L-1545.

1934
01:23:58,637 --> 01:24:00,116
Come immediately.
Got it?

1935
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:02,877
Hello?

1936
01:24:03,108 --> 01:24:03,710
Bholi is in the car.

1937
01:24:03,736 --> 01:24:04,578
Car is in the parking lot.

1938
01:24:04,643 --> 01:24:06,316
Parking lot is outside the mall.

1939
01:24:06,445 --> 01:24:08,686
License plate number CH-L-1545.

1940
01:24:08,747 --> 01:24:09,817
Okay, brother.

1941
01:24:10,282 --> 01:24:11,522
Hey. Shut up.

1942
01:24:12,417 --> 01:24:13,393
You are lucky.

1943
01:24:13,419 --> 01:24:15,719
You got saved.
You did the job.

1944
01:24:16,121 --> 01:24:18,294
Come on, now you go your way and I'll go my way.

1945
01:24:18,356 --> 01:24:19,630
"Chidi. Chidi. Chidi."

1946
01:24:20,425 --> 01:24:22,132
What trouble have you got me into?

1947
01:24:22,494 --> 01:24:23,837
What trouble are you talking about?

1948
01:24:24,095 --> 01:24:25,597
Mom's is in the car.

1949
01:24:26,131 --> 01:24:27,371
We didn't get Bholi.

1950
01:24:27,432 --> 01:24:28,740
"Trouble."
- Brother. - Yes.

1951
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,438
Found it.
- Okay.

1952
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:32,847
Tota.
- Yes, Guggi?

1953
01:24:32,904 --> 01:24:34,906
Guggi had made you a promise, right?

1954
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:36,501
Here's the car.

1955
01:24:36,527 --> 01:24:38,539
Bholi is sitting inside.

1956
01:24:38,844 --> 01:24:40,790
Be a Tota and get inside.

1957
01:24:41,146 --> 01:24:42,284
Bholi is inside?
-Yes.

1958
01:24:42,614 --> 01:24:43,888
Sure? - Yes.

1959
01:24:44,149 --> 01:24:46,595
Shall I go inside?
- Go. - Bholi!

1960
01:24:47,619 --> 01:24:49,326
I'm dead! I'm dead!
 - Damn you!

1961
01:24:49,421 --> 01:24:51,799
I wonder what's wrong with this generation.
 - Damn you.

1962
01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:53,301
They don't feel shy at all.

1963
01:24:53,658 --> 01:24:55,262
It was different for us.

1964
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:57,203
One needs to feel a little shy, right?

1965
01:24:57,262 --> 01:24:58,191
I'm sitting here.
Can't you see me?

1966
01:24:58,217 --> 01:24:58,960
- brother, please save me.

1967
01:24:59,164 --> 01:25:00,267
Brother. Brother.
-Just a minute.

1968
01:25:00,293 --> 01:25:01,328
Just a minute. Just a minute.

1969
01:25:01,399 --> 01:25:02,742
Just a minute.
Just a minute. - Can't you see?

1970
01:25:02,834 --> 01:25:03,505
What happened?

1971
01:25:03,568 --> 01:25:05,583
What will happen?

1972
01:25:05,609 --> 01:25:07,268
He teased me.

1973
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:10,215
I send to a girl and you started teasing an old woman?

1974
01:25:10,275 --> 01:25:12,881
Hey, who did you call an old woman?

1975
01:25:13,144 --> 01:25:14,521
Can't you address me as sister?

1976
01:25:14,579 --> 01:25:16,855
Sorry, sister.
He is my brother, Tota.

1977
01:25:16,948 --> 01:25:18,689
Apologize to her. - Forgive me.

1978
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:20,297
You should keep him at home.

1979
01:25:20,323 --> 01:25:21,483
Under lock and key.

1980
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:22,897
Otherwise he will lose his life.

1981
01:25:22,954 --> 01:25:24,865
I'll keep him under lock and key.

1982
01:25:25,457 --> 01:25:26,435
Sorry, sister.

1983
01:25:26,525 --> 01:25:27,697
Hey!

1984
01:25:28,426 --> 01:25:31,168
I'm madam for you.
 - Yes.

1985
01:25:31,696 --> 01:25:34,836
Sorry, madam.
- Damn him.

1986
01:25:36,401 --> 01:25:38,540
I'm in this mess because of you.

1987
01:25:39,037 --> 01:25:40,243
There are two girls and there's just one me.

1988
01:25:40,539 --> 01:25:42,450
Now how do I get out of this trouble?

1989
01:25:42,607 --> 01:25:44,587
Who wants you to get rid of them?

1990
01:25:44,643 --> 01:25:46,247
You should have fun.

1991
01:25:46,311 --> 01:25:49,315
Thank God. God is generous to you.

1992
01:25:49,447 --> 01:25:50,672
I don't have one.

1993
01:25:50,698 --> 01:25:52,282
I'm still searching.

1994
01:25:52,317 --> 01:25:53,295
And you have two.

1995
01:25:53,351 --> 01:25:56,491
Captain, movie stars always have two.

1996
01:25:56,555 --> 01:25:59,365
The Patiala King..
you know how many queens he has.

1997
01:25:59,558 --> 01:26:01,560
I'll throw you out of the car.

1998
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:04,436
I'm dying and you are joking.

1999
01:26:04,529 --> 01:26:07,476
Hear him.
- How do I get rid of Geet?

2000
01:26:07,566 --> 01:26:09,671
To get rid of Geet..

2001
01:26:09,768 --> 01:26:11,645
This "pollution" is a little complicated.

2002
01:26:12,137 --> 01:26:14,378
Situation.
- Right. It's the same.

2003
01:26:14,472 --> 01:26:17,681
Look captain, I think this girl is sharp.

2004
01:26:17,776 --> 01:26:19,653
She gave you a tit for tat.

2005
01:26:19,778 --> 01:26:21,621
She did that.

2006
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,821
I would've handled her if she was alone.

2007
01:26:24,149 --> 01:26:27,392
But what do I do with the "String" that came attached with her?

2008
01:26:27,519 --> 01:26:30,363
Who Pooja?
The one with an umbrella? - Right.

2009
01:26:31,056 --> 01:26:34,128
Hear that. I've a solution for him.

2010
01:26:34,259 --> 01:26:34,794
What?

2011
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:36,864
Here's a sword.
Let's slice him up.

2012
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:38,589
We'll get some meat out of him.

2013
01:26:39,798 --> 01:26:42,404
"Here comes another trouble."

2014
01:26:42,467 --> 01:26:44,845
"Here comes another trouble."

2015
01:26:47,839 --> 01:26:48,783
Hey!

2016
01:26:51,242 --> 01:26:54,280
The hands which were to hold a pen to give autographs"

2017
01:26:54,346 --> 01:26:57,953
...now hold a sword, because of you.

2018
01:26:58,016 --> 01:27:00,053
I'm here as your death, my enemy.

2019
01:27:00,585 --> 01:27:01,723
What are you waiting for? - Wait.

2020
01:27:01,953 --> 01:27:03,591
Go and slice him up.

2021
01:27:04,055 --> 01:27:05,336
What are you doing?

2022
01:27:05,362 --> 01:27:07,789
- Jassi is destined to kill Pooja.

2023
01:27:08,026 --> 01:27:09,726
Have you lost your mind?

2024
01:27:09,752 --> 01:27:11,521
You want to kill Pooja?

2025
01:27:11,963 --> 01:27:13,483
You have made me crazy.

2026
01:27:13,509 --> 01:27:15,094
- We'll sell his meat.

2027
01:27:15,166 --> 01:27:17,112
We'll make our movie by selling his meat.

2028
01:27:17,402 --> 01:27:19,183
Son, put your sword down.

2029
01:27:19,209 --> 01:27:20,704
What are you doing?

2030
01:27:23,108 --> 01:27:25,987
Misunderstanding.

2031
01:27:26,077 --> 01:27:28,079
You'll give a blockbuster movie.

2032
01:27:28,179 --> 01:27:30,125
Mind blowing.
- Mind blowing.

2033
01:27:30,181 --> 01:27:31,751
This is how you should act in the movie.

2034
01:27:32,017 --> 01:27:34,054
I say you'll take over the Punjabi film industry like a storm.

2035
01:27:34,152 --> 01:27:36,359
Storm? Film industry?

2036
01:27:36,521 --> 01:27:38,558
We were rehearing for a movie.

2037
01:27:39,257 --> 01:27:40,497
I couldn't do a scene.

2038
01:27:40,592 --> 01:27:43,596
Then the director told me to perform it with a family member.

2039
01:27:43,662 --> 01:27:45,505
So, I did it with Pooja.

2040
01:27:45,597 --> 01:27:48,203
Son, you are a very good acting.

2041
01:27:48,266 --> 01:27:49,768
You can praise him later.

2042
01:27:50,001 --> 01:27:53,448
First ask him who the girl that came to meet him was.

2043
01:27:53,505 --> 01:27:54,483
Ask him.

2044
01:27:55,306 --> 01:27:56,376
The heroine of the movie.

2045
01:27:56,441 --> 01:27:58,079
She had come to meet Geet.
Ask her.

2046
01:27:58,143 --> 01:27:59,238
Okay.

2047
01:27:59,264 --> 01:28:03,641
She came like a slow train.

2048
01:28:03,682 --> 01:28:06,424
And she left like a super-fast train.

2049
01:28:06,484 --> 01:28:08,088
Ask him why.
Ask him.

2050
01:28:08,319 --> 01:28:09,474
Because of Geet.

2051
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:12,315
She said, "I want to be the heroine."

2052
01:28:12,357 --> 01:28:13,563
I'll throw you out of the film."

2053
01:28:13,658 --> 01:28:14,494
She got angry.

2054
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:15,594
She said shut up.

2055
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:19,267
Now how can someone say shut up to my wife in front of me?

2056
01:28:19,364 --> 01:28:20,898
I told her, get out!

2057
01:28:20,924 --> 01:28:23,838
There are many like you.
- Good job.

2058
01:28:24,269 --> 01:28:27,648
This is what is called love.

2059
01:28:27,706 --> 01:28:30,084
'Okay. Another drama.'

2060
01:28:30,175 --> 01:28:32,519
'He is worse than minister when it comes to lying.'

2061
01:28:32,610 --> 01:28:33,732
'It's okay, dear.

2062
01:28:33,758 --> 01:28:35,275
Make me the heroine.'

2063
01:28:35,313 --> 01:28:37,589
'I'll expose you during the shooting.'

2064
01:28:39,117 --> 01:28:41,654
Rambo, how come she agreed to be the heroine so quickly?

2065
01:28:41,753 --> 01:28:43,130
Why do you worry, captain?

2066
01:28:43,188 --> 01:28:45,168
Unite her with that imported boy Sandy.

2067
01:28:45,223 --> 01:28:46,531
Get rid of her.

2068
01:28:46,624 --> 01:28:49,366
Once we rekindle their love, even if Roop comes for the shooting"

2069
01:28:49,427 --> 01:28:51,634
...it won't bother you or me.

2070
01:28:56,669 --> 01:28:59,411
You can fool my family but not me.

2071
01:28:59,672 --> 01:29:01,310
I'll do that right away.

2072
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,477
I'm not scared of your threats.

2073
01:29:03,709 --> 01:29:04,813
Should I scare you then?

2074
01:29:04,911 --> 01:29:05,981
Have a look.

2075
01:29:09,715 --> 01:29:11,194
You brought Sandy here?

2076
01:29:12,785 --> 01:29:15,265
Why? Didn't you like the surprise?

2077
01:29:16,689 --> 01:29:18,430
So, Sandy? - Sandy..

2078
01:29:20,326 --> 01:29:22,738
Thanks, brother, for coming here.
- Hello.

2079
01:29:22,795 --> 01:29:24,598
Come here.
 - Hello?

2080
01:29:24,624 --> 01:29:26,996
She is Geet.
Your Geet.

2081
01:29:27,033 --> 01:29:30,105
Brother, I'm sorry for whatever that happened.

2082
01:29:31,737 --> 01:29:34,115
Many times we get played by our circumstances.

2083
01:29:34,874 --> 01:29:39,084
And now it is time for you and Geet to unite.

2084
01:29:39,211 --> 01:29:43,318
Jassi, you should've asked me before doing all this.

2085
01:29:43,449 --> 01:29:44,816
Geet, we hardly ever talk.

2086
01:29:44,842 --> 01:29:46,944
Why should I share everything with you?

2087
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,431
I thought this will solve everything.

2088
01:29:49,889 --> 01:29:51,129
Hence I asked Sandy to come here.

2089
01:29:51,324 --> 01:29:54,066
Sandy, your Geet.
Take her.

2090
01:29:54,126 --> 01:29:56,936
First of all, I won't be doing that, Mr. Jassi.

2091
01:29:57,430 --> 01:29:59,068
But Geet belongs to you.
- Me?

2092
01:29:59,131 --> 01:30:00,519
She was to become mine.

2093
01:30:00,545 --> 01:30:01,932
But now she is yours.

2094
01:30:02,001 --> 01:30:04,880
Brother, we are just the opposite of each other.

2095
01:30:05,304 --> 01:30:07,113
If she is north then I am south.

2096
01:30:07,506 --> 01:30:10,043
We got married according to the rituals.

2097
01:30:10,309 --> 01:30:11,982
But we don't share anything.

2098
01:30:12,111 --> 01:30:14,955
Even if I park the car any someone's place..

2099
01:30:15,047 --> 01:30:17,926
...for four days, willing, I still worry about it.

2100
01:30:18,451 --> 01:30:23,764
And if I lend money, I count each and every pound when it is returned.

2101
01:30:23,823 --> 01:30:25,063
Wondering whether it's falling short.

2102
01:30:25,458 --> 01:30:27,404
You got me insulted in front of the whole village.

2103
01:30:27,493 --> 01:30:30,269
I came there to get married to her but you got married to her.

2104
01:30:30,329 --> 01:30:33,435
How many days and nights did you guys spend together?

2105
01:30:33,566 --> 01:30:35,944
And now you want me to take your used item?

2106
01:30:36,035 --> 01:30:39,448
When I never wear the shoes which are worn by others..

2107
01:30:39,505 --> 01:30:40,984
She is..
- Shut up!

2108
01:30:42,074 --> 01:30:44,884
Don't you say a word against Geet.

2109
01:30:45,444 --> 01:30:48,448
I know how a disgusting person like you thinks.

2110
01:30:48,981 --> 01:30:51,552
You can never know the relationship Geet and I share.

2111
01:30:51,784 --> 01:30:53,127
Then take her with you.
- Get lost.

2112
01:30:53,919 --> 01:30:55,672
You two look good together.

2113
01:30:55,698 --> 01:30:57,255
Go, take her with you.

2114
01:30:57,590 --> 01:31:00,230
Hey! Shut up! -Jassi!

2115
01:31:01,127 --> 01:31:04,199
I might need another lifetime to match up to her!

2116
01:31:04,463 --> 01:31:08,343
But you'll never be forgiven for the mistake you've made, you scoundrel.

2117
01:31:08,934 --> 01:31:12,279
Neither could you read her eyes nor her helplessness.

2118
01:31:12,338 --> 01:31:14,181
Good that I broke your alliance.

2119
01:31:14,573 --> 01:31:16,280
You are not worthy of her.

2120
01:31:17,910 --> 01:31:19,048
Yeah, right.

Where is the lighting's guy?

2178
01:33:52,431 --> 01:33:53,432
Don't worry.
- God help me.

2179
01:33:53,666 --> 01:33:55,236
No.
-We'll handle whatever that happens.

2180
01:33:55,301 --> 01:33:56,336
Look over there.

2181
01:33:57,937 --> 01:33:58,938
Ma'am, this way.

2182
01:34:00,306 --> 01:34:02,946
Sir?
The scene is ready?

2183
01:34:03,175 --> 01:34:05,678
We'll do this scene later.
- Sorry, sir.

2184
01:34:05,744 --> 01:34:07,382
Let me first watch this scene.

2185
01:34:07,446 --> 01:34:08,686
Action!

2186
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:14,327
Roop?
That's your name, right? - Yes.

2187
01:34:15,221 --> 01:34:17,919
But you are more beautiful than me.

2188
01:34:17,945 --> 01:34:19,023
- Thank you.

2189
01:34:19,391 --> 01:34:22,838
I feel I was a little too rude to you.

2190
01:34:22,895 --> 01:34:23,730
Not at all.

2191
01:34:23,756 --> 01:34:27,096
I forgave you as soon as I came to know the truth.

2192
01:34:27,499 --> 01:34:29,001
Sure?
- Yes.

2193
01:34:29,068 --> 01:34:30,513
You forgave me?
- I did.

2194
01:34:30,836 --> 01:34:32,360
So, we are friends now?

2195
01:34:32,386 --> 01:34:33,842
- Yes, good friends.

2196
01:34:35,741 --> 01:34:40,212
You know, the drama you did that day made me very upset.

2197
01:34:40,512 --> 01:34:43,459
Then Jassi told me that you guys had a bet going.

2198
01:34:43,515 --> 01:34:45,085
A bet?
 - Yes.

2199
01:34:45,150 --> 01:34:48,461
You had told Jassi that you can do drama and make us fight.

2200
01:34:49,054 --> 01:34:50,226
I said that?

2201
01:34:51,090 --> 01:34:53,468
You know, at first I didn't believe him.

2202
01:34:53,759 --> 01:34:56,171
Then I told Jassi that I want to meet Geet.

2203
01:34:57,329 --> 01:35:00,242
You know he was going to throw you out of the movie.
- Oh no.

2204
01:35:00,866 --> 01:35:03,176
I've known Jassi since so many years.

2205
01:35:03,469 --> 01:35:05,278
But still I wonder how I believed in your act.

2206
01:35:05,337 --> 01:35:07,214
...where you pretended to be his wife.

2207
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:09,478
You are a great actor.

2208
01:35:09,541 --> 01:35:12,215
You know, I could've got you out of the movie in no time.

2209
01:35:12,278 --> 01:35:13,279
Enough. Enough, madam.

2210
01:35:13,305 --> 01:35:14,078
Hit the brakes.

2211
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:16,953
You are just acting over smart.
- Oh no.

2212
01:35:17,249 --> 01:35:19,160
That day what I said about you being a witch..

2213
01:35:19,218 --> 01:35:22,791
...and about our marriage is 100% true.

2214
01:35:23,022 --> 01:35:26,765
Jassi and I are married following the religious rituals.

2215
01:35:26,959 --> 01:35:30,566
And I am working on the film because I want to. Got it?

2216
01:35:31,196 --> 01:35:31,802
Geet, stop it.

2217
01:35:31,828 --> 01:35:33,428
I know you are a very good actress.

2218
01:35:33,465 --> 01:35:35,308
Oh shut up. And get lost!

2219
01:35:35,367 --> 01:35:37,005
How much more do you want me to insult you?

2220
01:35:37,536 --> 01:35:38,981
Why don't you just leave?

2221
01:35:39,371 --> 01:35:40,706
Have you lost your mind?

2222
01:35:40,732 --> 01:35:41,899
Get lost from here.

2223
01:35:42,308 --> 01:35:44,015
She wants Jassi!

2224
01:35:44,076 --> 01:35:46,920
"Trouble. Trouble. Trouble."

2225
01:35:47,513 --> 01:35:48,787
Roop!

2226
01:35:48,847 --> 01:35:49,206
What happened?

2227
01:35:49,232 --> 01:35:50,180
You are leaving without meeting me.

2228
01:35:50,215 --> 01:35:51,193
Let go of my arm.

2229
01:35:52,017 --> 01:35:53,462
I didn't hold to let go of it.

2230
01:35:53,686 --> 01:35:56,428
Jassi, I said let go of it.
- Okay.

2231
01:35:56,655 --> 01:35:58,066
But at least tell me what happened.

2232
01:35:58,257 --> 01:35:59,322
Tell me something at least, Roop.

2233
01:35:59,348 --> 01:36:00,057
- Get out of my way.

2234
01:36:00,192 --> 01:36:02,331
And never come in way again.

2235
01:36:02,394 --> 01:36:03,737
I'll handle this unmannered boy.

2236
01:36:03,796 --> 01:36:05,173
That witch told you something again, right?

2237
01:36:05,364 --> 01:36:07,366
Why do you believe in Geet?

2238
01:36:07,766 --> 01:36:10,042
This is the way these actresses are.

2239
01:36:10,135 --> 01:36:11,349
They make up their own stories.

2240
01:36:11,375 --> 01:36:12,470
They dramatize everything.

2241
01:36:12,671 --> 01:36:14,810
Yes, just like you.

2242
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:17,680
You liar.
You stone-hearted person.

2243
01:36:17,743 --> 01:36:20,246
Roop, he can do anything to have what he wants.

2244
01:36:20,713 --> 01:36:22,351
Hello?
Who are you?

2245
01:36:22,481 --> 01:36:23,587
We are talking, right?

2246
01:36:23,613 --> 01:36:24,918
Why are you interfering?

2247
01:36:24,950 --> 01:36:26,301
Hey, show some respect.

2248
01:36:26,327 --> 01:36:27,854
She is my sister-in-law.

2249
01:36:28,053 --> 01:36:30,863
You forgot?
You loved me.

2250
01:36:30,990 --> 01:36:33,834
And we've even had an illicit relationship.

2251
01:36:34,159 --> 01:36:35,695
I'm Karina's wife.

2252
01:36:35,761 --> 01:36:38,401
The one for whose divorce you gave a false testimony.

2253
01:36:38,764 --> 01:36:40,334
Your memory is bad.

2254
01:36:40,399 --> 01:36:43,209
Sister-in-law, isn't he the same guy?
- No, Roop.

2255
01:36:43,268 --> 01:36:45,339
Are you sure?

2256
01:36:46,071 --> 01:36:48,071
No, Roop.
He is the same guy.

2257
01:36:48,097 --> 01:36:49,407
You come with me.

2258
01:36:50,509 --> 01:36:52,819
Roop.. -Jassi,
how many girls do you love?

2259
01:36:53,145 --> 01:36:54,522
I just love you, Roop.

2260
01:36:54,747 --> 01:36:55,987
Please listen to me.

2261
01:36:56,048 --> 01:36:59,291
Please. Roop.
Please don't go. Roop!

2262
01:36:59,351 --> 01:37:00,421
Roop!

2263
01:37:00,986 --> 01:37:02,966
Roop, at least listen to me!

2264
01:37:03,122 --> 01:37:03,823
Damn the sister-in-law.

2265
01:37:03,849 --> 01:37:04,854
She has got me into a new mess.

2266
01:37:11,397 --> 01:37:12,501
Sister-in-law, ask him to go away.

2267
01:37:12,564 --> 01:37:13,826
Roop, at least listen to me.

2268
01:37:13,852 --> 01:37:14,933
- Jassi, please leave.

2269
01:37:14,967 --> 01:37:16,071
Stop the car. - Please.

2270
01:37:16,301 --> 01:37:17,974
Mend your ways.
- Roop, try to understand.

2271
01:37:18,270 --> 01:37:19,421
Roop, I'm not a bad guy.

2272
01:37:19,447 --> 01:37:20,502
Please listen to me.

2273
01:37:20,539 --> 01:37:21,609
Don't trouble me.
Go away.

2274
01:37:21,673 --> 01:37:23,380
Stop the car for a minute.
Please.

2275
01:37:23,442 --> 01:37:25,786
Jassi, please forgive me.
Go away.

2276
01:37:25,844 --> 01:37:27,915
I've never seen such an ill-mannered person.
- Go away!

2277
01:37:27,980 --> 01:37:31,393
Roop, listen to me.
Roop.

2278
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:32,358
Roop.

2279
01:37:32,418 --> 01:37:34,489
Just drive!
 - Go away!

2280
01:37:34,553 --> 01:37:36,794
Roop! Stop!

2281
01:37:36,855 --> 01:37:38,493
Hit the gas.
Damn him.

2282
01:37:38,557 --> 01:37:39,729
Roop, listen to me.
 Roop.

2283
01:37:53,172 --> 01:37:55,448
He got into an accident before he left Pooja behind.

2284
01:37:55,674 --> 01:37:57,984
But there is nothing to worry about now.

2285
01:37:58,043 --> 01:37:59,852
Pooja has taken care of everything.

2286
01:37:59,945 --> 01:38:02,391
Otherwise who knows what would've happened to this boy.

2287
01:38:02,448 --> 01:38:04,450
This boy is strange.

2288
01:38:04,683 --> 01:38:07,892
He sometimes fights with her and sometimes gets himself hit.

2289
01:38:07,953 --> 01:38:11,662
Headman, I think someone has done something on him.

2290
01:38:11,723 --> 01:38:12,997
Ward off the evil from him.

2291
01:38:13,058 --> 01:38:14,765
Brother, these things are useless.

2292
01:38:14,827 --> 01:38:16,170
No. Please keep quiet.

2293
01:38:16,228 --> 01:38:17,468
Pooja, you scared us.

2294
01:38:18,097 --> 01:38:19,474
He is fine.
He is absolutely fine.

2295
01:38:19,698 --> 01:38:20,562
It's okay, son.

2296
01:38:20,588 --> 01:38:22,431
And then you are a true lover.

2297
01:38:22,468 --> 01:38:24,721
And lovers are strong.

2298
01:38:24,747 --> 01:38:25,872
Be strong.

2299
01:38:25,904 --> 01:38:28,817
How can I act strong when all my ribs hurt?

2300
01:38:28,907 --> 01:38:30,682
My ankle used to hurt as well.

2301
01:38:30,742 --> 01:38:31,982
I had twisted it.

2302
01:38:32,044 --> 01:38:33,717
I went to the doctor.

2303
01:38:33,779 --> 01:38:35,383
He said you'll have to treat it with turmeric.

2304
01:38:35,447 --> 01:38:37,188
It will get better in a few years.

2305
01:38:37,249 --> 01:38:38,786
Now look, it's absolutely fine.

2306
01:38:38,812 --> 01:38:40,050
It doesn't hurt at all.

2307
01:38:40,085 --> 01:38:41,291
Does it hurt you?
- Hey.

2308
01:38:41,453 --> 01:38:43,899
Fool..
-We'll have to treat it with turmeric.

2309
01:38:43,956 --> 01:38:45,435
Stop blabbering.

2310
01:38:45,991 --> 01:38:47,800
Go and get ready.

2311
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:50,269
Do we have to go to get turmeric? - No.

2312
01:38:50,329 --> 01:38:51,706
Elections are approaching.

2313
01:38:51,763 --> 01:38:52,867
Who will speak on the loud speaker?

2314
01:38:52,931 --> 01:38:55,434
Headman, anyone can give a speech.

2315
01:38:55,501 --> 01:38:58,209
But who will apply turmeric on his body?

2316
01:38:58,270 --> 01:39:01,931
Geet is here to look after Jassi.

2317
01:39:01,957 --> 01:39:03,176
His wife.

2318
01:39:03,208 --> 01:39:04,516
You are absolutely right, papa.

2319
01:39:04,977 --> 01:39:07,856
I'll take care of Jassi.
- Good.

2320
01:39:07,913 --> 01:39:10,120
Okay, dear. We'll make a move now.

2321
01:39:10,182 --> 01:39:11,855
You should stay back for a while, papa.

2322
01:39:12,184 --> 01:39:15,722
No, dear.
One shouldn't stay at their daughter's house for long.

2323
01:39:16,021 --> 01:39:17,329
Fine, we'll make a move.

2324
01:39:18,223 --> 01:39:20,533
I'll send some turmeric.
You take"

2325
01:39:22,961 --> 01:39:24,357
Yes, I was talking abut turmeric.

2326
01:39:24,383 --> 01:39:25,398
- Bye, son. Bless you.

2327
01:39:25,430 --> 01:39:28,968
Let's go.
- You heal faster if you have turmeric in your milk.

2328
01:39:55,661 --> 01:40:00,007
<i>"Try looking through the layers of your heart."</i>

2329
01:40:00,065 --> 01:40:04,104
<i>"You might find my name written somewhere."</i>

2330
01:40:04,937 --> 01:40:09,147
<i>"Try looking through the layers of your heart."</i>

2331
01:40:09,208 --> 01:40:12,883
<i>"You might find my name written somewhere."</i>

2332
01:40:14,279 --> 01:40:18,728
<i>"Sit close to me sometimes."</i>

2333
01:40:18,784 --> 01:40:22,163
<i>"Why do you always maintain a distance?"</i>

2334
01:40:23,288 --> 01:40:27,930
<i>"Try looking through the layers of your heart."</i>

2335
01:40:27,993 --> 01:40:31,770
<i>"You might find my name written somewhere."</i>

2336
01:40:32,664 --> 01:40:36,874
<i>"Try looking through the layers of your heart."</i>

2337
01:40:36,935 --> 01:40:39,939
<i>"You might find my name written somewhere."</i>

2338
01:41:10,302 --> 01:41:14,682
<i>"Listen to the plea of this foolish girl, my love."</i>

2339
01:41:14,973 --> 01:41:19,183
<i>"You dwell in my heart, my love."</i>

2340
01:41:19,578 --> 01:41:23,958
<i>"How can you be so oblivious, my love?"</i>

2341
01:41:24,182 --> 01:41:28,221
<i>"You've ruined me, my love."</i>

2342
01:41:28,820 --> 01:41:32,859
<i>"You've ruined me, my love."</i>

2343
01:41:32,924 --> 01:41:41,241
<i>"Your silence hurts me."</i>

2344
01:41:41,833 --> 01:41:45,713
<i>"Try looking through the layers of your heart."</i>

2345
01:41:45,771 --> 01:41:50,083
<i>"You might find my name written somewhere."</i>

2346
01:41:51,009 --> 01:41:54,889
<i>"Try looking through the layers of your heart."</i>

2347
01:41:54,946 --> 01:41:58,826
<i>"You might find my name written somewhere."</i>

2348
01:42:28,780 --> 01:42:32,990
<i>"I'm breathing for you, my love."</i>

2349
01:42:33,318 --> 01:42:37,460
<i>"You don't know the state of my heart, my love."</i>

2350
01:42:37,823 --> 01:42:42,294
<i>"I talk to you, my love."</i>

2351
01:42:42,694 --> 01:42:46,801
<i>"There are a lot of questions in my heart, my love."</i>

2352
01:42:47,232 --> 01:42:51,180
<i>"There are a lot of questions in my heart, my love."</i>

2353
01:42:51,236 --> 01:42:59,849
<i>"Tell me why didn't you see love in my eyes?"</i>

2354
01:43:00,145 --> 01:43:04,355
<i>"Try looking through the layers of your heart."</i>

2355
01:43:04,416 --> 01:43:08,159
<i>"You might find my name written somewhere."</i>

2356
01:43:09,388 --> 01:43:13,200
<i>"Try looking through the layers of your heart."</i>

2357
01:43:13,258 --> 01:43:18,037
<i>"You might find my name written somewhere."</i>

2358
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:44,125
It's been 10 days since your son last came home.

2359
01:43:44,423 --> 01:43:45,663
He didn't inform us.

2360
01:43:45,724 --> 01:43:48,068
Rather than having such a child it's better not to have one.

2361
01:43:48,126 --> 01:43:50,003
Why don't you talk sensible for a change?

2362
01:43:50,061 --> 01:43:52,337
Ask those who don't have any child.

2363
01:43:52,831 --> 01:43:55,311
And my son is busy with shootings.

2364
01:43:55,367 --> 01:43:57,973
Actors don't have much time for their family.

2365
01:43:58,370 --> 01:44:00,145
You are a chameleon's mother.

2366
01:44:00,839 --> 01:44:02,375
Sit on a chair in the courtyard"

2367
01:44:02,441 --> 01:44:05,183
...then see how producers line up for your son.

2368
01:44:05,243 --> 01:44:06,984
That day isn't far away either.

2369
01:44:09,181 --> 01:44:10,990
Is this Jassi's house?

2370
01:44:11,283 --> 01:44:12,284
Who is he?

2371
01:44:12,350 --> 01:44:13,954
Who is this ill-mannered man?

2372
01:44:14,019 --> 01:44:15,673
Didn't you hear me?

2373
01:44:15,699 --> 01:44:17,787
Is this Jassi's house?

2374
01:44:17,823 --> 01:44:19,894
Mind your language. Who are you?

2375
01:44:19,958 --> 01:44:21,369
Consider me as Jassi's death.

2376
01:44:21,426 --> 01:44:24,839
I'll break your neck if you anything bad about my son.

2377
01:44:24,896 --> 01:44:26,136
I won't.

2378
01:44:26,198 --> 01:44:29,873
Give me, Rs. 50 lakhs and I won't say a thing.

2379
01:44:30,435 --> 01:44:33,814
Rs. 50 lakhs?
-Yes, Rs. 25 lakhs is the principal amount"

2380
01:44:33,872 --> 01:44:35,078
...and Rs. 25 lakhs is the interest.

2381
01:44:36,041 --> 01:44:39,352
Pay the money back to brother Guggi then he won't even breathe.

2382
01:44:39,411 --> 01:44:40,481
Okay, old man?

2383
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:45,227
Forgive me, he survives on slaps.

2384
01:44:47,686 --> 01:44:51,395
Why are you staring at me as if I'm a crocodile in a zoo.

2385
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:53,834
Give me Rs. 50 lakhs.

2386
01:44:54,025 --> 01:44:55,698
Take the money from the one you give it to.

2387
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:59,105
Who will I ask, Baba Ramdev, if not his parents?

2388
01:44:59,464 --> 01:45:01,967
Give me Rs. 50 lakhs.

2389
01:45:02,033 --> 01:45:04,411
Otherwise, I'll kill everyone here!

2390
01:45:04,970 --> 01:45:07,280
Everyone? It's just two of them.

2391
01:45:07,339 --> 01:45:10,718
Or do you want to kill your own people as well?

2392
01:45:15,614 --> 01:45:19,118
Jassi's mother, we have guests at home.

2393
01:45:19,584 --> 01:45:21,086
Go, get some tea and snacks for them.

2394
01:45:21,319 --> 01:45:23,060
Why should I make tea for them?

2395
01:45:23,121 --> 01:45:25,101
Try and understand. Go and get tea.

2396
01:45:26,124 --> 01:45:27,501
I'll give them tea for sure.

2397
01:45:31,663 --> 01:45:32,937
Guest"
- Yes?

2398
01:45:32,998 --> 01:45:34,909
Why don't you continue with your slapping game..

2399
01:45:35,066 --> 01:45:38,673
...I'll go arrange for money for you.
- Go.

2400
01:45:41,139 --> 01:45:43,847
I wonder what this Jassi keeps doing.

2401
01:45:53,919 --> 01:45:55,421
That's it!
The job's done!

2402
01:45:55,887 --> 01:45:58,424
Enough.
You've thrashed us enough.

2403
01:46:00,158 --> 01:46:02,434
My husband has lost his mind.

2404
01:46:02,661 --> 01:46:04,572
He will never stop being a crazy Jatt.

2405
01:46:04,796 --> 01:46:06,935
So, now tell me.

2406
01:46:07,032 --> 01:46:09,979
I made a mistake, sir.
I apologize.

2407
01:46:10,135 --> 01:46:14,015
Forget near your house, I'll never come near your village.

2408
01:46:14,072 --> 01:46:15,574
That would be better.
-Yes.

2409
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:16,880
Tea is coming.
- Okay.

2410
01:46:17,008 --> 01:46:19,682
Now quietly sit down and drink tea.

2411
01:46:19,744 --> 01:46:21,849
He first thrashed us and now he is serving us tea.

2412
01:46:22,614 --> 01:46:23,718
Catch the tail.

2413
01:46:23,782 --> 01:46:25,784
This is how he serves people.

2414
01:46:25,984 --> 01:46:27,906
Okay. Hearty congratulations.

2415
01:46:27,932 --> 01:46:29,456
They are now married.

2416
01:46:29,487 --> 01:46:31,433
You can fulfill the rest of the formalities.

2417
01:46:32,057 --> 01:46:33,400
Bless you, kids.

2418
01:46:33,458 --> 01:46:36,530
Oh yes, you don't need to fear Headman Mohan Singh.

2419
01:46:36,995 --> 01:46:38,099
He can do you no harm.

2420
01:46:38,163 --> 01:46:40,871
Do something for me, dad.

2421
01:46:40,932 --> 01:46:42,138
Damn you.

2422
01:46:42,434 --> 01:46:46,075
Jassi and Bholi love each other a lot.

2423
01:46:46,137 --> 01:46:47,673
They are like two bodies and one soul.

2424
01:46:47,973 --> 01:46:50,886
Why don't you let them unite?

2425
01:46:51,109 --> 01:46:55,558
A person named Jassi can never love anyone.
Got it?

2426
01:46:56,181 --> 01:46:58,218
You are wrong, Barrister.

2427
01:46:59,517 --> 01:47:02,987
Jassi is an example for all the lovers in this world.
-Yes.

2428
01:47:03,054 --> 01:47:04,601
Absolutely right.

2429
01:47:04,627 --> 01:47:06,993
- Absolutely wrong, son.

2430
01:47:07,025 --> 01:47:09,155
I disagree.
- Fine with me.

2431
01:47:09,181 --> 01:47:11,863
It's not like I'm losing a case.

2432
01:47:12,797 --> 01:47:18,076
Jassi and a minute"
- Tiny.. -Yes.

2433
01:47:18,136 --> 01:47:20,382
Small?
With long hair?

2434
01:47:20,408 --> 01:47:21,938
Lanky?
-Yes.

2435
01:47:21,973 --> 01:47:23,646
Rambo?
- Yes.

2436
01:47:25,744 --> 01:47:26,916
The same.

2437
01:47:31,483 --> 01:47:33,622
I apologize for all the mistakes I have made.

2438
01:47:34,986 --> 01:47:38,957
I am your culprit but I am also someone who worships you.

2439
01:47:40,692 --> 01:47:42,035
How do I trust you?

2440
01:47:43,061 --> 01:47:44,592
You always lie.

2441
01:47:44,618 --> 01:47:46,659
- Come on. Come on.

2442
01:47:46,698 --> 01:47:49,508
Hello. Madam. Don't listen to him.

2443
01:47:50,602 --> 01:47:52,479
This person is lying.

2444
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:55,076
Because he doesn't love you.

2445
01:47:55,102 --> 01:47:56,541
He loves Bholi.

2446
01:47:56,574 --> 01:47:57,712
Yes.

2447
01:47:58,243 --> 01:47:59,688
Son, do you know him?

2448
01:48:00,278 --> 01:48:02,554
He says that you love a girl named Bholi.

2449
01:48:05,550 --> 01:48:07,223
What will he say?

2450
01:48:07,249 --> 01:48:08,920
Let me tell you.

2451
01:48:09,254 --> 01:48:12,064
Jassi is a liar.

2452
01:48:12,724 --> 01:48:15,500
He loves all the girls he comes across.

2453
01:48:15,994 --> 01:48:17,940
Earlier he used to love Karmo.

2454
01:48:18,229 --> 01:48:20,140
Then he loves Bholi.

2455
01:48:20,231 --> 01:48:24,941
Forget that, a few days ago he went to a village.

2456
01:48:25,003 --> 01:48:31,181
Villagers forced him to marry a girl named Geet.

2457
01:48:31,509 --> 01:48:32,681
Do you know what happened after that?

2458
01:48:32,744 --> 01:48:33,882
He came back running to me.

2459
01:48:33,945 --> 01:48:37,154
"Sir! Sir! Sir!
I want a divorce."

2460
01:48:37,215 --> 01:48:38,922
"Prepare the divorce papers."

2461
01:48:38,983 --> 01:48:42,521
If you don't believe me then go to the court tomorrow.

2462
01:48:42,587 --> 01:48:46,831
Got it?
You fool, you are leaving your wife because of this boy?

2463
01:48:46,891 --> 01:48:48,978
Damn you. See you.
I'm making a move.

2464
01:48:49,004 --> 01:48:49,624
Let's go.

2465
01:48:49,661 --> 01:48:50,833
But.. but dad..
- Let's go home. We'll talk.

2466
01:48:50,895 --> 01:48:52,806
But dad, I am..

2467
01:48:55,033 --> 01:48:56,239
Do you have to say something about it?

2468
01:48:56,301 --> 01:48:57,712
What is there to say?

2469
01:48:57,769 --> 01:48:59,840
You first forced him to marry her.

2470
01:48:59,904 --> 01:49:01,679
Now he has to suffer. - Enough.

2471
01:49:01,906 --> 01:49:05,046
If you say another word then I'll bury you so deep..

2472
01:49:05,110 --> 01:49:07,056
"That no one will be able to find you.

2473
01:49:08,813 --> 01:49:10,156
I'll take care of you later.

2474
01:49:10,215 --> 01:49:12,092
But what you did was not right.

2475
01:49:12,217 --> 01:49:14,128
You made me commit a big sin.

2476
01:49:14,686 --> 01:49:16,859
Brother, now tell me what should we do.

2477
01:49:17,288 --> 01:49:20,929
Should we shoot the boy first or apologize to the girl first?

2478
01:49:22,093 --> 01:49:24,835
First we've to fulfill a father's and a brother's duty.

2479
01:49:25,163 --> 01:49:28,303
We need to go and apologize to her father.

2480
01:49:29,167 --> 01:49:31,340
We made a very big mistake.

2481
01:49:32,103 --> 01:49:34,276
Let's go, dear.
- But headman uncle..

2482
01:49:35,073 --> 01:49:37,075
Come with me, dear.

2483
01:49:37,776 --> 01:49:41,246
I'll take care of you later.
 - Jassi.

2484
01:49:51,923 --> 01:49:53,231
Captain!

2485
01:49:57,028 --> 01:49:58,530
Why do you look so sad?

2486
01:49:58,596 --> 01:50:00,234
You should dance!

2487
01:50:00,465 --> 01:50:01,982
God answered your prayers.

2488
01:50:02,008 --> 01:50:03,232
You got rid of her.

2489
01:50:09,507 --> 01:50:14,547
Your Honor, now there is nothing left to be said in this case.

2490
01:50:15,580 --> 01:50:17,560
You just tell us your judgment.

2491
01:50:18,917 --> 01:50:20,089
Just a minute, Your Honor.

2492
01:50:21,486 --> 01:50:24,626
I would just like to say that witness Jassi..

2493
01:50:24,856 --> 01:50:27,132
...should reconsider the statement he gave earlier..

2494
01:50:27,725 --> 01:50:31,764
...and tell the court whether he has told the truth.

2495
01:50:32,163 --> 01:50:37,010
Because, Your Honor, two lives are depending on his statement.

2496
01:50:37,068 --> 01:50:38,308
Two lives.

2497
01:50:38,536 --> 01:50:41,745
Mr. Jassi, are you telling the truth?

2498
01:50:42,106 --> 01:50:44,313
Did you tell the truth?

2499
01:50:55,787 --> 01:50:57,266
Whatever I said earlier..

2500
01:50:58,656 --> 01:50:59,999
Was true, Your Honor.

2501
01:51:01,793 --> 01:51:04,865
Sister-in-law Karmo, whom I affectionately call Karam..

2502
01:51:05,163 --> 01:51:06,642
...has no character at all.

2503
01:51:07,332 --> 01:51:10,211
Karma is a nice and a decent man.

2504
01:51:11,736 --> 01:51:14,046
And Karmo is a characterless woman.

2505
01:51:16,908 --> 01:51:20,788
She changes her friends like trends change with fashion.

2506
01:51:21,346 --> 01:51:22,984
First she made me her friend and then..

2507
01:51:23,281 --> 01:51:26,091
...brought me to court and hit the delete button.

2508
01:51:27,852 --> 01:51:31,299
Man is just like an object she uses!

2509
01:51:34,225 --> 01:51:35,260
What happened, Karam?

2510
01:51:36,060 --> 01:51:38,199
Are you no longer interested in me?

2511
01:51:38,863 --> 01:51:40,672
Or did you find a new friend?

2512
01:51:40,732 --> 01:51:43,178
Shut up, you dog! Stop your nonsense!

2513
01:51:45,136 --> 01:51:49,642
I'll kill you if you say another word against Karmo.

2514
01:51:49,707 --> 01:51:52,881
She is my wife. I know her very well.

2515
01:51:53,011 --> 01:51:57,187
She can be argumentative, quarrelsome and a spendthrift.

2516
01:51:57,882 --> 01:51:59,884
But she cannot be characterless.

2517
01:52:00,351 --> 01:52:02,763
You should have at least a little shame before saying such a thing.

2518
01:52:02,820 --> 01:52:05,232
Do you have any humanity in you?

2519
01:52:05,924 --> 01:52:09,895
Your Honor, whatever he is saying is nonsense.

2520
01:52:09,994 --> 01:52:11,735
All the accusations are baseless.

2521
01:52:11,796 --> 01:52:13,173
He is lying.

2522
01:52:14,966 --> 01:52:17,879
Do you love her?
Yes, I love her.

2523
01:52:18,069 --> 01:52:20,345
And I am not your friend?
- Do you think I am?

2524
01:52:20,405 --> 01:52:22,282
You cannot leave her, can you?
- No, I can't.

2525
01:52:22,340 --> 01:52:25,878
You mean the statement I gave earlier was a lie?

2526
01:52:25,944 --> 01:52:28,185
Yes, you are a liar. A liar!

2527
01:52:32,250 --> 01:52:33,695
It's all clear now, Your Honor.

2528
01:52:34,052 --> 01:52:35,895
Actually, there was no trouble at all.

2529
01:52:36,821 --> 01:52:38,823
Actually, there were no issues between them.

2530
01:52:39,357 --> 01:52:40,927
Just a small misunderstanding.

2531
01:52:41,893 --> 01:52:43,133
A small ego.

2532
01:52:44,762 --> 01:52:47,470
Actually they love each other a lot.

2533
01:52:48,266 --> 01:52:49,973
They cannot live without each other.

2534
01:52:51,703 --> 01:52:56,015
Karamjeet Kaur is a very decent and respectful lady.

2535
01:52:57,742 --> 01:52:58,982
Forgive me, sister-in-law.

2536
01:52:59,510 --> 01:53:01,854
Whatever I said today was not to ruin your married life..

2537
01:53:02,013 --> 01:53:03,321
"But to help resolve your issues.

2538
01:53:06,351 --> 01:53:10,458
I request the court not to grant them divorce.

2539
01:53:14,092 --> 01:53:16,504
Look, let bygones be bygones.

2540
01:53:17,028 --> 01:53:19,531
Jassi made mistakes or they just kept happening..

2541
01:53:20,064 --> 01:53:21,805
I forgave Jassi for them.

2542
01:53:24,836 --> 01:53:26,281
This mother is great.

2543
01:53:27,472 --> 01:53:30,453
This is the first time a mother forgave her useless son.

2544
01:53:32,443 --> 01:53:35,049
Fine. I, too, forgave him.

2545
01:53:36,347 --> 01:53:42,821
So, Karam Singh, I ask Roop's hand in marriage for Jassi.

2546
01:53:42,887 --> 01:53:44,161
Do you give your consent for it?

2547
01:53:44,222 --> 01:53:46,202
What can I..
- Why do you ask him, uncle?

2548
01:53:46,257 --> 01:53:47,235
Ask me.

2549
01:53:47,291 --> 01:53:50,898
Jassi isn't that bad that we'll separate him from Roop.

2550
01:53:50,962 --> 01:53:52,771
Look, everything is fixed.

2551
01:53:52,897 --> 01:53:56,435
But they cannot get married till he and Geet don't get a divorce.

2552
01:53:56,501 --> 01:53:58,981
I'll do this good deed for Geet.

2553
01:53:59,570 --> 01:54:01,481
Because I was the one who committed a crime..

2554
01:54:02,140 --> 01:54:03,585
...by getting him married to Geet.

2555
01:54:04,342 --> 01:54:06,344
Headman Amar Singh..

2556
01:54:07,412 --> 01:54:08,914
God of love.

2557
01:54:14,385 --> 01:54:18,060
Hey, you used to say that only those girls and boys..

2558
01:54:18,122 --> 01:54:20,068
...who love each other run way from their houses.

2559
01:54:21,392 --> 01:54:26,000
Then how did you mess up in the case of Geet and Jassi?

2560
01:54:26,064 --> 01:54:28,567
I still think the same, Mohan Singh.

2561
01:54:30,068 --> 01:54:32,810
It's unfortunate that time made me meet your son..

2562
01:54:33,004 --> 01:54:35,006
...and I committed a sin.

2563
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:40,416
If Geet hadn't stopped me for the sake of her love..

2564
01:54:40,845 --> 01:54:43,416
...then you wouldn't have found your son alive.

2565
01:54:43,581 --> 01:54:45,322
Mind your language.

2566
01:54:46,117 --> 01:54:48,859
You are threatening my son in my own house?

2567
01:54:48,920 --> 01:54:51,628
Yes, look at my courage.

2568
01:54:52,423 --> 01:54:56,269
I might tread less by I tread with pride.

2569
01:54:59,797 --> 01:55:01,242
Sign the documents.

2570
01:55:01,999 --> 01:55:05,310
Fibber, Geet forgave you.

2571
01:55:05,369 --> 01:55:06,780
She frees you.

2572
01:55:08,906 --> 01:55:11,079
Sign those and make them leave.

2573
01:55:15,246 --> 01:55:16,418
What are you thinking about?

2574
01:55:16,481 --> 01:55:19,018
If that useless actor can give his autograph on these papers..

2575
01:55:19,083 --> 01:55:22,895
...and gets out of your life then what else do you want?

2576
01:55:22,954 --> 01:55:24,831
This is destiny's tactics.

2577
01:55:25,456 --> 01:55:28,437
Dear, we are your culprits.

2578
01:55:30,261 --> 01:55:31,740
Don't get upset, dear.

2579
01:55:32,463 --> 01:55:34,374
The bad phase is over.

2580
01:55:34,432 --> 01:55:36,105
You should be happy.

2581
01:55:36,167 --> 01:55:38,738
You should be grateful.

2582
01:55:38,803 --> 01:55:40,305
You got rid of trouble.

2583
01:55:40,404 --> 01:55:46,150
I've rectified my mistake and also brought your other culprit.

2584
01:55:47,478 --> 01:55:50,482
Come, son!
ome in.

2585
01:55:53,918 --> 01:55:55,761
Hello, everyone.
- Hello!

2586
01:55:55,820 --> 01:55:57,356
Sandy! You!

2587
01:55:57,522 --> 01:56:00,765
Geet, what I said, what wrong I thought about you..

2588
01:56:00,892 --> 01:56:02,030
I'm sorry for that.

2589
01:56:02,193 --> 01:56:03,467
I know you are nice.

2590
01:56:03,528 --> 01:56:05,872
All this confusion was created because of that Jassi.

2591
01:56:05,930 --> 01:56:09,935
I'll give you love all my life and erase the mistakes I made.

2592

01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:57,077
Catch the tail.

2654
01:59:57,103 --> 01:59:57,825
What will we do now?

2655
01:59:57,862 --> 02:00:00,172
I had told you not to mess with MLA's daughter.

2656
02:00:00,398 --> 02:00:00,842
Come on, get down.

2657
02:00:00,898 --> 02:00:01,933
We'll handle this MLA as well.

2658
02:00:01,999 --> 02:00:02,841
What is it?
- Come on, get down.

2659
02:00:03,434 --> 02:00:04,139
<i>O</i> Okay'!!-

2660
02:00:04,402 --> 02:00:06,473
Sir, I feel embarrassed.

2661
02:00:06,537 --> 02:00:07,538
I apologize.

2662
02:00:07,564 --> 02:00:10,066
My son doesn't listen to me.

2663
02:00:10,408 --> 02:00:13,946
I'm ready to return whatever gifts where exchanged.

2664
02:00:16,547 --> 02:00:18,993
I'll get my daughter married to someone else.

2665
02:00:19,950 --> 02:00:20,758
But you..

2666
02:00:20,818 --> 02:00:23,094
You are giving such big lectures.

2667
02:00:23,487 --> 02:00:24,966
This isn't your election time.

2668
02:00:25,456 --> 02:00:26,764
You have made us breathless.

2669
02:00:26,957 --> 02:00:29,563
You can get your daughter married to anyone you want to.

2670
02:00:31,495 --> 02:00:34,237
They.. these two were the ones there that day.

2671
02:00:34,532 --> 02:00:37,012
They are going around with these two scoundrels.
- Sit.

2672
02:00:37,101 --> 02:00:39,138
Have a look at their clothes.

2673
02:00:39,437 --> 02:00:41,508
As if they are some band members.

2674
02:00:41,772 --> 02:00:44,480
Looks like your mother has stitched them..

2675
02:00:44,575 --> 02:00:47,112
...from the same piece of cloth.

2676
02:00:47,511 --> 02:00:49,218
You are very bossy, lady.

2677
02:00:49,480 --> 02:00:51,153
Will you join our gang?

2678
02:00:51,248 --> 02:00:53,990
Hey! Mind your language.

2679
02:00:54,151 --> 02:00:55,653
Have you seen your face?

2680
02:00:55,753 --> 02:01:00,133
It looks like a washed sock is kept for drying.

2681
02:01:01,058 --> 02:01:02,901
Why don't you say something?

2682
02:01:02,993 --> 02:01:03,869
Keep quiet. Sit down.

2683
02:01:03,928 --> 02:01:04,599
Hey!

2684
02:01:04,695 --> 02:01:06,038
What will he say?

2685
02:01:07,131 --> 02:01:10,806
I came to know that you wanted to make Bholi run away.

2686
02:01:10,868 --> 02:01:12,271
Not to make run away.

2687
02:01:12,297 --> 02:01:14,033
We wanted to kidnap her.

2688
02:01:14,171 --> 02:01:17,050
You weren't ready to get Bholi married to Tota.

2689
02:01:17,141 --> 02:01:19,747
We didn't want Tota to die because of you.
- Yes.

2690
02:01:19,844 --> 02:01:22,017
What are you saying?
- Hey!

2691
02:01:22,146 --> 02:01:24,490
You are great.
- Brother. Brother"

2692
02:01:24,582 --> 02:01:26,653
I've already had my share of beating.

2693
02:01:26,750 --> 02:01:28,559
I don't want to get thrashed again.

2694
02:01:28,619 --> 02:01:30,530
Try to understand.
Don't get angry.

2695
02:01:30,888 --> 02:01:33,732
Brother, do you know what he means?

2696
02:01:33,891 --> 02:01:35,666
We were going to kidnap Bholi.

2697
02:01:35,926 --> 02:01:37,906
Then we would've taken her to Tota.

2698
02:01:38,095 --> 02:01:39,836
We would've got her married to Tota.

2699
02:01:39,997 --> 02:01:41,999
After that would've come to you.

2700
02:01:42,166 --> 02:01:43,577
You must've seen it in the movies.

2701
02:01:43,701 --> 02:01:46,580
The girl's father agrees in the end.

2702
02:01:48,672 --> 02:01:53,246
This means Tota still wants to marry Bholi?

2703
02:01:53,444 --> 02:01:55,720
Yes.
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

2704
02:01:57,748 --> 02:02:00,058
For that you'll have to quit being gangsters.

2705
02:02:00,117 --> 02:02:01,152
We'll quit. - They did it.

2706
02:02:01,252 --> 02:02:02,446
Then Tota belongs to us.

2707
02:02:02,472 --> 02:02:03,814
- You can take him. Okay.

2708
02:02:03,921 --> 02:02:08,233
Here, he got a ready-made son.

2709
02:02:08,692 --> 02:02:12,799
Get Bholi married to him and get my son rid of trouble.

2710
02:02:12,863 --> 02:02:13,341
Yes.

2711
02:02:13,397 --> 02:02:16,776
If this is what you want then so be it.

2712
02:02:18,802 --> 02:02:20,179
Inspector Surinder..

2713
02:02:21,138 --> 02:02:22,276
Hello.

2714
02:02:22,740 --> 02:02:24,242
This is MLA Nachhattar Singh.

2715
02:02:24,341 --> 02:02:27,413
My daughter's in-laws want more dowry.

2716
02:02:27,745 --> 02:02:29,725
And they have thrown her out of the house.

2717
02:02:29,914 --> 02:02:31,860
Do whatever you can.

2718
02:02:32,216 --> 02:02:33,354
Arrest them.

2719
02:02:35,252 --> 02:02:38,722
Okay. The MLA has done his duty.
-Yes.

2720
02:02:38,822 --> 02:02:41,462
Now a father will perform his duty.

2721
02:02:41,926 --> 02:02:42,802
Good luck.

2722
02:02:42,860 --> 02:02:43,964
Let's go, kids.

2723
02:02:54,872 --> 02:02:56,249
We are from the girl's side.

2724
02:02:58,075 --> 02:02:59,986
Hello. Hello.

2725
02:03:00,544 --> 02:03:01,852
Hello.
- Hi.

2726
02:03:04,615 --> 02:03:05,650
N ow?

2727
02:03:07,952 --> 02:03:08,987
You want to go now?
- Go.

2728
02:03:09,086 --> 02:03:10,064
Go, hurry up. - Go.

2729
02:03:11,155 --> 02:03:14,625
Jassi, captain, is my child.

2730
02:03:14,725 --> 02:03:16,033
I wanted to make him a hero.

2731
02:03:16,226 --> 02:03:17,366
But his misfortune.

2732
02:03:17,392 --> 02:03:18,891
He is getting married..

2733
02:03:18,929 --> 02:03:21,034
...when I wanted him to touch the sky.

2734
02:03:21,332 --> 02:03:24,074
Yes, Doctor?
Why did you call me here?

2735
02:03:25,336 --> 02:03:26,610
To see my headgear?

2736
02:03:27,871 --> 02:03:29,680
I wanted to see the face behind it.

2737
02:03:29,740 --> 02:03:30,878
Have you never seen it before?

2738
02:03:32,009 --> 02:03:33,352
I have seen it a number of times.

2739
02:03:34,712 --> 02:03:36,055
But since the past few days..

2740
02:03:36,113 --> 02:03:38,320
...I've been seeing someone else's face in it.

2741
02:03:39,016 --> 02:03:40,222
What are you saying, Roop?

2742
02:03:41,051 --> 02:03:42,758
I don't love Geet.

2743
02:03:44,154 --> 02:03:45,394
What you lost your mind?

2744
02:03:45,623 --> 02:03:48,126
Saw? You took Geet's name.

2745
02:03:48,192 --> 02:03:50,172
Jassi, you are getting married because..

2746
02:03:50,227 --> 02:03:52,138
...you think it's the right thing to do.

2747
02:03:52,896 --> 02:03:53,897
Don't do that.

2748
02:03:54,164 --> 02:03:56,405
Geet loves you a lot.

2749
02:03:57,001 --> 02:03:57,945
How do you know?

2750
02:03:58,002 --> 02:03:58,925
I'm a girl.

2751
02:03:58,951 --> 02:04:01,804
I know how a girl's heart works.

2752
02:04:01,905 --> 02:04:03,179
Just a minute.

2753
02:04:04,708 --> 02:04:05,880
Uncle, where's the groom?

2754
02:04:06,810 --> 02:04:08,118
I don't know.
He went to the bathroom.

2755
02:04:08,178 --> 02:04:09,316
Come on, let's find him.
- He still hasn't returned.

2756
02:04:09,380 --> 02:04:10,222
Come on, let's check.
- Come on.

2757
02:04:10,280 --> 02:04:11,384
Let's check. Come on.

2758
02:04:11,615 --> 02:04:13,253
You love her and yet you feel scared?

2759
02:04:13,317 --> 02:04:14,559
I'm not scared.

2760
02:04:14,585 --> 02:04:16,653
You are not getting me.

2761
02:04:17,721 --> 02:04:18,825
She is getting married today.

2762
02:04:19,056 --> 02:04:21,036
Then get it called off.
- Have you lost your mind?

2763
02:04:22,226 --> 02:04:23,864
You can call off other people's weddings.

2764
02:04:24,061 --> 02:04:25,836
But you cannot listen to your heart.

2765
02:04:26,263 --> 02:04:27,640
Are you saying that from your heart?

2766
02:04:27,765 --> 02:04:28,641
Go, Jassi.

2767
02:04:28,667 --> 02:04:31,033
Just remember one thing.

2768
02:04:32,736 --> 02:04:34,682
Roop was someone you loved.

2769
02:04:35,172 --> 02:04:36,947
Geet is someone you love.

2770
02:04:38,275 --> 02:04:39,083
Did you find him?

2771
02:04:39,143 --> 02:04:41,123
I've looked for him everywhere.
I couldn't find him.

2772
02:04:44,648 --> 02:04:46,719
Dear, did Jassi come here?

2773
02:04:47,451 --> 02:04:49,021
He had come here. He left.

2774
02:05:20,184 --> 02:05:21,219
Stop, Geet!

2775
02:05:22,686 --> 02:05:24,632
You cannot marry this boy.

2776
02:05:26,156 --> 02:05:29,228
I know I shouldn't have come here today.

2777
02:05:29,960 --> 02:05:32,531
I don't have any right to interfere in your life.

2778
02:05:32,830 --> 02:05:34,070
But what can I do, Geet?

2779
02:05:34,264 --> 02:05:35,766
I love you a lot.

2780
02:05:35,866 --> 02:05:38,745
I cannot live without you.
- You are back?!

2781
02:05:38,802 --> 02:05:40,145
Tell me what do you want now?

2782
02:05:40,571 --> 02:05:41,811
Why don't you say something, Geet?

2783
02:05:42,906 --> 02:05:45,284
Tell them that you love me a lot.

2784
02:05:46,110 --> 02:05:49,683
No, papa. I don't love him.

2785
02:05:49,747 --> 02:05:52,557
Hey, you are back to create more mess?

2786
02:05:52,616 --> 02:05:53,993
Brother, hit him.

2787
02:05:54,051 --> 02:05:58,659
I knew that this scoundrel won't learn a lesson..

2788
02:05:58,722 --> 02:05:59,792
...till he's beaten black and blue.

2789
02:06:16,774 --> 02:06:17,809
No!

2790
02:06:26,083 --> 02:06:27,187
Geet!

2791
02:06:30,087 --> 02:06:31,930
Why don't you understand, Jassi?

2792
02:06:32,790 --> 02:06:34,326
I don't love you.

2793
02:06:35,559 --> 02:06:39,336
If I was in love with you then why would I be getting married to Sandy?

2794
02:06:40,597 --> 02:06:42,577
You are lying to yourself, Geet.

2795
02:06:43,767 --> 02:06:45,610
Do you think that you've made the right decision?

2796
02:06:49,273 --> 02:06:53,619
Parents have always made the decisions for their children.

2797
02:06:54,711 --> 02:06:56,122
And they are never wrong.

2798
02:06:58,715 --> 02:07:02,162
I'll marry the boy my father wants me to.

2799
02:07:04,254 --> 02:07:05,392
Is this your final decision?

2800
02:07:05,622 --> 02:07:08,034
Look, Jassi, don't create a scene.

2801
02:07:08,392 --> 02:07:09,928
Please leave.

2802
02:07:10,794 --> 02:07:12,933
We were fated to met because of a mistake"

2803
02:07:13,163 --> 02:07:15,165
...and it is fate that has separated us.

2804
02:07:15,866 --> 02:07:18,813
Think that you never met someone called Geet.

2805
02:07:19,336 --> 02:07:21,407
Go away from here. For my sake.

2806
02:07:22,105 --> 02:07:24,346
Didn't you hear what the girl said?

2807
02:07:24,408 --> 02:07:26,217
Are you still not satisfied?

2808
02:07:27,711 --> 02:07:29,657
Do you wish to get thrashed some more?

2809
02:07:29,713 --> 02:07:30,953
Enough, uncle. Enough.

2810
02:07:32,349 --> 02:07:34,795
Today, for the first time in my I spoke the truth.

2811
02:07:35,419 --> 02:07:36,864
And I got punished for that.

2812
02:07:39,723 --> 02:07:42,101
You want me to get out of your life forever, right?

2813
02:07:43,427 --> 02:07:44,633
Fine, I'm going.

2814
02:07:47,364 --> 02:07:51,369
"Love hurts."

2815
02:07:54,071 --> 02:07:57,883
"It makes your heart ache."

2816
02:08:00,377 --> 02:08:05,224
"Even after hurting.."

2817
02:08:06,049 --> 02:08:10,759
"it's always becalms the heart."

2818
02:08:25,502 --> 02:08:27,778
Look, your darling son is back.

2819
02:08:33,677 --> 02:08:34,815
Jassi?

2820
02:08:35,212 --> 02:08:36,589
Where were you?

2821
02:08:36,813 --> 02:08:37,848
Are you alright?

2822
02:08:37,915 --> 02:08:39,553
What happened?
 - He is fine.

2823
02:08:39,616 --> 02:08:40,822
Nothing's wrong with him.

2824
02:08:41,818 --> 02:08:44,298
It's just that he has too much makeup on.

2825
02:08:44,521 --> 02:08:45,727
Courtesy to strangers.

2826
02:08:45,789 --> 02:08:47,598
You are just"
- No, mother.

2827
02:08:47,758 --> 02:08:49,101
Please forgive me, father.

2828
02:08:50,294 --> 02:08:51,898
I was really wrong.

2829
02:08:53,196 --> 02:08:57,110
Neither could I become a hero nor could I be a good son.

2830
02:08:59,970 --> 02:09:04,043
I lost, mother. I really lost.
- No.

2831
02:09:05,943 --> 02:09:08,787
Henceforth, I'll do as you say.

2832
02:09:08,845 --> 02:09:11,655
If you are so regretful then why don't you apologize to her..

2833
02:09:11,848 --> 02:09:13,623
The one whose life you were about to ruin.

2834
02:09:14,551 --> 02:09:16,087
Why are you staring at us?

2835
02:09:16,153 --> 02:09:18,690
Go inside and meet her.
-Yes, son.

2836
02:09:18,755 --> 02:09:20,029
Go inside and meet her.
 -Yes, son.

2837
02:09:20,090 --> 02:09:21,763
Go. - Go inside.

2838
02:09:36,907 --> 02:09:38,614
What happened?
You came back alone?

2839
02:09:38,809 --> 02:09:40,652
Geet didn't come with you?
- No.

2840
02:09:41,078 --> 02:09:43,058
Geet and I can never be together.

2841
02:09:45,549 --> 02:09:47,324
Actually, she doesn't love me at all.

2842
02:09:48,885 --> 02:09:50,361
What did you say?

2843
02:09:50,387 --> 02:09:51,948
I don't love you?

2844
02:09:52,889 --> 02:09:54,994
Geet! What are you doing here?

2845
02:09:55,258 --> 02:09:58,239
Oh really?
You left her alone over there.

2846
02:09:58,295 --> 02:10:00,297
And now that she has come on her own you ask her why?

2847
02:10:00,630 --> 02:10:02,667
Who said so?
When did I leave her?

2848
02:10:02,733 --> 02:10:04,337
She didn't come with me.
- Oh really?

2849
02:10:04,701 --> 02:10:07,113
When you had come to call off my wedding, you did it.

2850
02:10:07,571 --> 02:10:10,313
Now when you had come to take me, why did you leave me there?

2851
02:10:10,941 --> 02:10:13,979
You were the one begging me to leave.

2852
02:10:14,044 --> 02:10:16,615
Hey mister, it's me who saved your life.

2853
02:10:16,680 --> 02:10:20,321
If I wouldn't have begged they would've thrashed you black and blue.

2854
02:10:20,717 --> 02:10:23,220
Hello! I'm not so bad.

2855
02:10:23,587 --> 02:10:26,193
If I'd died I would've taken four with me.

2856
02:10:27,257 --> 02:10:28,998
I shied away because of respect.

2857
02:10:29,059 --> 02:10:32,268
This is what charmed me, son.

2858
02:10:32,329 --> 02:10:33,637
He is back!

2859
02:10:33,697 --> 02:10:38,407
A boy who can keep quiet for a girl even after getting thrashed..

2860
02:10:38,635 --> 02:10:43,345
I can make a guess how much he loves her.

2861
02:10:43,640 --> 02:10:45,847
Why are you surprised?

2862
02:10:46,877 --> 02:10:48,720
Are you the only one who can act?

2863
02:10:48,945 --> 02:10:50,185
Can't we act?

2864
02:10:51,148 --> 02:10:52,991
As far as the thrashing is concerned..

2865
02:10:53,050 --> 02:10:57,328
The thing is, someone has said, that a boy should be exercised..

2866
02:10:57,387 --> 02:11:01,199
...and a metal should be coated otherwise they both get rusted.

2867
02:11:02,392 --> 02:11:03,928
What is it?
Why are you all so quiet?

2868
02:11:04,194 --> 02:11:05,696
Did I lie?

2869
02:11:07,330 --> 02:11:10,072
Saw?
You didn't want my son to be an actor.

2870
02:11:10,133 --> 02:11:12,113
Look, he has brought home a Katerina Kaif.

2871
02:11:14,071 --> 02:11:16,813
So, should we shoot for the movie again?
