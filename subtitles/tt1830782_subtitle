1
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:52,998
Everybody get back to work.
Hurry up. - Hello.

2
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,593
Hello, Mr. Raghupati.
- Hello. Welcome.

3
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:56,928
Hello. - Hello.

4
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:58,194
He's Raghupati.

5
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,360
They both are the senior
most couple of the family.

6
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,064
They are good friend of Mr. Raj.

7
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,803
Since he studied in the same
school in which Mr. Raj studied.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,810
He is a well known stage artist.

9
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,007
But he couldn't become a film star.

10
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:13,115
Hello. Welcome.

11
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:15,913
They've sent the banana stem.
What do I do with it?

12
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,713
Go to market and sell it.

13
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,883
Send it to the wedding hall.

14
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:21,822
He's Raghava.

15
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,427
He's a jovial man.

16
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:26,620
But he has great
respect for his brother.

17
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:28,892
It is? Okay. Hello. - Hello.

18
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:30,262
He's Raja ram.

19
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,835
He was born late.
And also late is doing his work.

20
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:34,939
A useless man.

21
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,938
Excuse me.
- I haven't received the sari yet.

22
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,667
Why don't you call him?
- You haven't received the sari yet?

23
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,104
She's Bharati.

24
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,679
And the man with her is her husband..

25
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,817
...who is more like a slave to her.

26
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:48,885
Raghupati,
Raghava, Rajaman and Bharati.

27
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:52,353
Their father was a freedom fighter.

28
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,296
By the way, where is Rama?

29
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:10,475
Rama? - Father?

30
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,575
What's going on?

31
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:15,213
Is this the way you behave
in the presence of the guests?

32
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:17,747
They are laughing. They are enjoying.

33
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,679
If they were enjoying
they would've clapped"

34
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:20,817
...and not laughed at you.

35
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,453
Brother-in-law,
I told you the other day..

36
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,146
...to send him to college
and get him educated.

37
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,121
But look what he has become.

38
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,056
I was not aware of the
consequences for learning dance.

39
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:32,219
Father. - Shut up.

40
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:33,397
Swapna?

41
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,466
Where is your cousin?

42
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,661
He must he be on his way.

43
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,464
Are you sure he's coming?

44
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:44,472
My cousin will surely come.

45
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,737
The auspicious period is nearing.
I'm very much tensed about you.

46
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:52,076
When I'm not tensed
then why are you?

47
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,751
It is me who's going
to elope with my cousin.

48
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,147
Oaky. - Brother..

49
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:57,481
...we haven't received
the wedding sari yet.

50
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,180
Don't worry. Calm down.

51
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,121
We should be leaving to
the wedding hall in 20 minutes?

52
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,157
We will be there in 10 minutes.

53
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,025
He's intelligent with his talks..

54
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,597
...and fast as an arrow.

55
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,825
Raam, I'm suffering from
blood pressure and diabetes.

56
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:43,229
If you drive so fast,
I won't die in the accident..

57
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,028
...I will die of fear.

58
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:46,865
I won't let you die.

59
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:49,974
You're not God to save me from dying.

60
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,609
Go slow.

61
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,072
Otherwise, stop the bike.

62
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,576
I will take a bus and
reach the wedding hall on time.

63
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:59,149
Priest, we are already
running out time.

64
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:01,286
And if you take a bus you will reach
only after the consummation night.

65
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:02,886
Oh God.

66
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,255
Hello, priest. - Hello.

67
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,625
How are you? - I'm lucky to be alive.

68
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,766
Did he trouble you?

69
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,699
I must say,
your boy almost killed me..

70
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:24,138
"Speeding on this bike
having me sit at the back seat.

71
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,810
Then why are you late?

72
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,639
Uncle, the priest was
actually scared very much.

73
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,610
That's why I'd to drive
the bike slowly. - I see.

74
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,305
Was that slow? - Yes.

75
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,849
Thanks. - Raam, Swapna is waiting.
Go and give it to her.

76
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,246
Priest, please come in.

77
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,648
Where to? - Come inside

78
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,811
What's the matter?

79
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:43,485
Since he drove the bike so fast,
guess I lost my memory power.

80
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,027
How is priest Ganapati?

81
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,030
He's fine.

82
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:48,928
But there's only one difference.
- What is it?

83
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:51,695
He doesn't eat oblation.

84
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:53,561
Priest? - Yes?

85
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:55,536
Do you eat oblation?

86
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:59,575
My son Rama is an illiterate.

87
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,143
He should kill himself.

88
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,314
Thank you. Thank you very much.

89
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,313
You're very naughty.

90
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:06,540
Don't be confused.

91
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,778
He likes to be degraded
more than being appreciated.

92
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,987
Then what was the need
to give birth to him?

93
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:15,718
Why are you late?

94
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,691
Making arrangements for
the register marriage isn't easy.

95
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:20,798
It is difficult to convince
the registrar and the peon.

96
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:21,989
He's right.

97
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,601
Here's the wedding sari.

98
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,065
Get ready soon.

99
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,500
Please take everybody's
blessings for the last time.

100
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:29,663
Okay? - Okay.

101
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,902
Cousin, I love you so much.
- Me too.

102
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,204
Get ready. - Okay.

103
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,741
This puppy's mother is with me.

104
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:42,580
But what's the point? You even
don't know where to kiss the dog.

105
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:46,246
These days, dogs have
more value than human begins.

106
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:50,987
Why? - Since it is the dog
the heroine kisses in the film..

107
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,653
...when the hero betrays her.

108
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,196
Why are you feeling jealous?

109
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,389
There are some who
are born as human beings..

110
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,035
...instead of being born as dogs.

111
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:02,034
Raam, what's the matter? Tell me?
- Stand here. I will tell you.

112
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,503
Swapna?

113
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:12,713
Come.
Doesn't she look beautiful?

114
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,544
You're right.

115
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,881
What's the hurry?
We could've met her later, right?

116
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,522
Probably, you won't get
a chance to see her again?

117
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,680
What do you mean? - You will
be tired after the wedding.

118
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,224
And you will weep
when you bid her adieu..

119
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,884
...and that's really bad.

120
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,030
You must bid her
adieu happily, right?

121
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,756
You're right. - Seek their blessings.

122
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,797
Come on. - God bless you.

123
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,896
Raam, come here?

124
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,332
We thought you were still a child..

125
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,904
...and you knew nothing.

126
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:36,836
But you're too intelligent.
- Thank you.

127
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,271
Wait a minute.

128
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:41,469
You told us you would give
us a surprise. What's the surprise?

129
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,478
Go to Swapna's room
after 10 minutes..

130
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:45,776
...you will know it yourself. - I see.

131
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,683
Surprise after 10 minutes.

132
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,878
I wonder what the surprise could be.

133
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,683
10 minutes has passed.

134
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,359
Swapna? Swapna?

135
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,221
Swapna?

136
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:02,731
Brother-in-law!

137
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:04,963
Why haven't they come yet?

138
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,831
Why are you in a hurry..

139
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:10,804
...when the couple who are about
to get ruined are not in a hurry?

140
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,274
I was supposed to get Saif
Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor married.

141
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,310
They've other elderly
people to bless them..

142
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,348
...but for this marriage
you're the only elderly person.

143
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,782
Why are you late?

144
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,751
He needs to attend
Kareena Kapoor's wedding.

145
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,185
Sign here.

146
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,221
Right here.

147
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,760
Congratulations.

148
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:48,342
How could anyone not realize
what's going on in this house?

149
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,975
What are you all doing in this house?

150
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,209
None of us knew that he
would give us such a surprise.

151
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:57,547
Swapna made a mistake
hiding about her love to us.

152
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:00,817
And he made a bigger
mistake supporting her.

153
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,587
He ruined our family reputation.

154
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:09,925
Hereafter, no one will
talk to him nor talk about him.

155
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:14,471
If not for my cousin,
we wouldn't have got married. Got it?

156
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,766
That doesn't mean to
touch my feet for blessings.

157
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:17,998
I don't like it.

158
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,837
You're right. I too don't like it.

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,105
You can at least thank me, right?

160
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:23,713
It was your duty.

161
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,109
Why should I thank you?

162
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:26,340
Well said.

163
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,851
Look Bhaskar,
Swapna is my uncle's only daughter.

164
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,717
What do mean?
Even I'm the only son to my parents.

165
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,186
Don't mistake me.

166
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,688
I understand.

167
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,088
Even I left my parents like Swapna.

168
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,786
I got a good job in New Zealand.

169
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,057
We are leaving tonight.

170
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:42,427
And don't worry.

171
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,691
She'll be happy-

172
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,900
Good. Swapna,
I must say, he's a nice guy.

173
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,698
You have bright future.

174
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,974
But I have a doubt about my future.

175
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,544
No doubt you're in trouble now.

176
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,009
They will not allow
you inside the house.

177
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,580
What will you do now?

178
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,648
I will go back to Bellary.

179
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,581
I will be completing
my engineering in six months.

180
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,345
I will think about the rest later.

181
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,227
GOPi? - Yes?

182
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,418
Come here.

183
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:12,790
Where is Raam?

184
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:13,862
On the way.

185
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,967
Losers will always remain losers.
- You're right.

186
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,137
He means to say us.

187
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,068
Idiots.

188
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,942
Dear friends,
due to financial crisis..

189
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,736
...Raam's father couldn't
him pocket money.

190
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:36,787
So as a friend, I'm taking
care of all his expenditures.

191
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,956
Here you're. Are you happy?

192
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,322
Thank you.

193
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:49,263
Never hesitate in
helping one another.

194
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,034
Did it really hurt you?

195
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:54,034
She didn't hurt me,
she actually touched my heart.

196
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,435
I really enjoyed it.

197
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:02,371
Raju, even I'm a poor student.
- I will surely help you.

198
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,175
Help me too. - Help me too.

199
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,045
Now I've become a poor student.

200
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:11,314
That's why nobody politician
comes forward to solve poverty issue.

201
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:18,391
Hello? - Hello. This is Reema
calling from telephone company.

202
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:19,586
Tell me?

203
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:22,790
We've introduced a new
scheme called family planning.

204
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,491
Family planning?

205
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:26,461
Unbelievable.

206
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,732
Sir, if any member of your
family is running a business..

207
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,408
...in another place or
studying in a another place..

208
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:32,906
...you can talk to them for free.

209
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:36,912
I'm not interested. Hang up.

210
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,147
Darn it.

211
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:48,357
Hello? - Mother,
why is uncle still upset with me?

212
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:50,993
Wrong number.

213
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,060
Hello? - I'm Brahma speaking.
I'm a Radio Jockey.

214
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,567
I'm Rama alias Ramanand.

215
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,067
Oh, so sweet.

216
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,132
I watched your dance
program some days ago.

217
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,274
You were great.

218
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,036
Will you please perform
on our radio station?

219
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,612
Oh. Thank you very much.

220
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:10,804
Just a minute.

221
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:14,349
Father, they watched
my performance on the radio.

222
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,485
They are very happy-

223
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:18,020
They want my program in radio city.

224
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,556
Life is so beautiful.

225
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,954
Father, what do I tell them?
- You fool.

226
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,220
How it is possible to
watch your dance on the radio?

227
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,455
You're such a fool.

228
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,065
Give me the phone.

229
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,725
Excuse me.
My uncle wants to talk to you.

230
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:37,531
You can never fool me, remember that.

231
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,038
Hang I-PI-

232
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:42,479
Hi. - What is it?

233
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,582
Heard you're excited staying
away from you parents, right?

234
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,082
Yes. - I'm also excited about it.

235
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,979
Shut up. I'm not a lowly girl.

236
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,384
Even I'm not a lowly guy.

237
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,390
My boss always advices
us to enjoy every moment of life.

238
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:08,065
Why is she crying?
- She's crying unnecessarily.

239
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,435
She's isn't insane to cry
unnecessarily. Tell n1e the truth.

240
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:14,010
I asked her to be my date
since she's alone in the hostel.

241
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,874
Okay. What was your reply to it?

242
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:18,675
I didn't reply to him.
- You must do it.

243
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:23,714
How dare you hit me with the slipper?

244
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,015
When the American president
got hit by slipper..

245
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,624
...you are not big deal.

246
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:31,659
You should've thought about
it before messing with her.

247
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,295
Hey.

248
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:37,024
How dare you hit
the guy from my area?

249
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,660
Your area? - I rule Bellary.

250
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,235
I rule entire Karnataka.

251
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:44,466
I think you're doing wrong.

252
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:45,939
I know whether I'm
doing right or doing.

253
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,544
I'm ready to face anyone.
- You're ready? Fight me.

254
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,146
Hey you. - You.

255
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:51,246
Stop it!

256
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,179
You think this to
be a college or a market?

257
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,717
Why are you behaving like goons?

258
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:59,345
He'd a query. And by the time
I could explain to him, you came.

259
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,991
Otherwise I would've
explained to him practically.

260
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,958
I've understood your guys quite.
Go to your classes.

261
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,289
Come on, go to your classes.

262
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,897
Come on. Go.

263
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,358
I said, go.

264
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,086
Raam, pass it to me.

265
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,169
Raam, come on.

266
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,447
Listen, everybody.

267
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,251
Hereafter, no rules.
W must teach them. - Okay, boss.

268
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:10,655
Come on, Raam.

269
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,088
Come on, Raam.

270
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,628
Pass the ball to me.

271
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:18,931
Pass the ball to me.

272
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,827
They are playing foul, Raam. - Yes.

273
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,489
Let's play like them.
Understand? - Okay.

274
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,293
Come on. Move! Move! Move!

275
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,772
Come on.

276
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,244
Neither we should be happy"

277
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:17,752
...nor you should be depressed..

278
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,945
...for the way we played.

279
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,283
It is a hustle.

280
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:25,962
Why should we fight among ourselves?

281
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,862
We will be in this
only for few more days.

282
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,466
Then we will go in different ways.

283
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:32,296
So, let's give up our enmity..

284
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,528
...and be happy together.

285
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,207
Raam, he thrashed me.

286
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:40,009
If we treat people like our enemies..

287
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,236
...they will remain enemies.

288
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,744
If we treat them like friends,
they will be friends.

289
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,962
Ready, we are ready to
even fight back against the sun.

290
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:40,694
We are ready to even kiss the moon.

291
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,498
Ready to even create a rainbow.

292
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,333
Ready to even create lightning.

293
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:46,170
Ready to even make a revolution.

294
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:48,209
We do not fear.

295
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:51,974
Everybody, clap 1.. 2.. 3..

296
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:59,012
Everybody, clap 1.. 2.. 3..

297
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:06,152
Ready, we are ready to
even fight back against the sun.

00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:09,892
We are ready to even kiss the moon.

299
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,363
Ready.

300
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,124
We have no time to wander.

301
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:42,822
We don't get depressed
though our girlfriends betray us.

302
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:46,527
Small dreams can
never disappoint us.

303
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:50,105
We try to touch the sky.

304
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,037
To fight.. - Ready.

305
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:53,869
To confront.. - Ready.

306
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,773
To threaten.. - Ready.

307
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,675
To create a thrill.. - Ready.

308
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,613
Like it is impossible to
stop the earth from revolving?

309
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:05,449
Similarly, nobody can stop us now.

310
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:09,149
Everybody, clap 1.. 2.. 3..

311
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:16,695
Everybody, clap 1.. 2.. 3..

312
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:23,735
Ready, we are ready to
even fight back against the sun.

313
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:28,173
We are ready to even kiss the moon.

314
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,208
We are naughty and also talented.

315
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,684
We enter into one
way and pay the fine too.

316
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:15,549
We even give suggestions.

317
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:19,288
We even beat the
one who mess with us.

318
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,159
For the rally.. - Ready.

319
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,027
For the race.. - Ready.

320
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:24,759
For the party" - Ready

00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,698
For the fight.. - Ready.

322
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:31,171
We all are ambitious.

323
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:34,436
We always attain victory.

324
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,979
Everybody, clap 1.. 2.. 3..

325
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:45,548
Everybody, clap 1.. 2.. 3..

326
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,118
Ready.

Ready.

328
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:57,660
Ready.

329
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,070
Four years passed away in jiffy.

330
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:06,809
Mr. Gunduraju,
why are you packing your luggage?

331
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:08,036
Even I'm leaving to my home town.

332
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,838
Don't you think I
will pass even this year?

333
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,447
Not just think I'm sure.

334
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:15,449
No chance. I will surely
score 90 percent in my exam.

335
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,383
In that case,
I will surely pass. - How?

336
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:20,683
I've written my register
number on your answer sheet.

337
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:21,984
Idiot.

338
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:24,784
Hi.

339
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:26,361
Is everyone ready?

340
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:28,597
What's the matter with him?

341
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:32,463
He saw a girl some days ago.
He's been thinking about her.

342
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,366
Hello? Raam?

343
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,698
If she's Goddess Sta,
you will surely get her.

344
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,077
Get ready soon.

345
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,570
Mr. Gunduraju? - Yes.

346
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:44,544
Your mortuary van.. - What?

347
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:46,512
Sorry. Your Maruthi van.

348
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,651
Your grandpa's memorabilia?

349
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:49,876
Is it still in a good condition?

350
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:54,047
With my grandpa's blessings it
will always be in a good condition.

351
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,724
If you don't take off your hands..

352
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,623
...you will go out of condition.

353
00:21:59,018 --> 00:21:59,962
Thank you.

354
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:03,965
By the way, why is Gopi
not to be seen? - You're right.

355
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,999
Let's go and meet him.

356
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:08,702
Quiet. - Uncle, where is Gopi?

357
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:12,740
He's locked himself into the room.
- What's the matter with him?

358
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:15,344
He was in love with
a girl named Savita..

359
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:19,175
...and her parents are getting
her married to another guy.

360
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:24,679
You cannot live without her, right?

361
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:27,423
Even she cannot live without n1e.

362
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:30,822
These girls.. - Hey.

363
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,632
Just shut up.

364
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,602
When is her marriage?

365
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:41,931
Today.

366
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:44,074
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

367
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:47,872
Make the arrangements
for the marriage.

368
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:49,910
We will bring the girl. Let's go.

369
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:52,345
I will meet you after the marriage.

370
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,779
Don't say that.
We might need your van. Let's go.

371
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,979
You were spared since
it was your uncle.

372
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:03,284
Once I commit,
I'm ready to face any consequences.

373
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:06,191
You're helping all
the girls in eloping.

374
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:08,593
What if someone take away your girl?
- Shut up.

375
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:12,325
No one can dare do that.

376
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:15,370
Babu, find out the nearest
wedding hall. - Okay.

377
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,805
Who are you?
- We are the bride's relative.

378
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,537
Hey you. Come here.

379
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,738
What is it? - Do you know them?

380
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,441
I don't know them.

381
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,814
Raam, we are putting ourselves
into trouble unnecessarily.

382
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:33,285
Let's go away.

383
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:36,426
Once I commit,
I'm ready to face any consequences.

384
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:37,853
Come on.

385
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:41,665
Being a friend you're
putting us trouble?

386
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:43,561
Look, what I'm carrying.

387
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,065
What is that? - Chloroform.

388
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,395
It will be of great use to us.

389
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,902
Have you experimented anytime?

390
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,538
Yes.

391
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,809
What have you done? - Idiot.

392
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,973
It's unbelievable.

393
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,944
Don't harm everyone. - Then whom?

394
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:01,776
Only those who pose many
questions to you. - How many?

395
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,045
They shouldn't ask you
more than three questions.

396
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:05,688
In case, they ask more than three
questions, spread it on them. - Okay.

397
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:07,415
Hurry I-PI-

398
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,424
Uncle will get upset if we are late.

399
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:13,961
Why do you fear him
when he doesn't respect you?

400
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:16,997
Don't say that.

401
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:20,501
Ours is a highly dignified family.

402
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:35,383
My uncle will embrace me tight.

403
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,315
Let's see. Come on.

404
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,116
Uncle Nagaraj. - Who's that?

405
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:42,384
Uncle Nagaraj. - Who are you?

406
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,185
Don't you know me? - No.

407
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:46,454
I'm Singishetappds son.

408
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:49,725
Kopplu. - Oh.
You're Singishetappds son.

409
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:53,563
You're my relative.
I want to embrace.

410
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,730
By the way, who is she?
- She's Rajappa's daughter-in-law.

411
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,410
Inter caste marriage? - Yes.

412
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:03,809
I now understand why
he's so depressed in life.

413
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:13,417
What is her relation with me?

414
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:16,651
I don't know,
but she like your daughter.

415
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:19,118
We are getting late.
Let's go. - Let's go.

416
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:20,558
Who is he? - I don't know.

417
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,198
Uncle, how are you? - Fine.

418
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:23,992
Who are these goons?
- I will tell you later.

419
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,964
First go inside. - Let's go.

420
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:27,831
Who are you? - Let's go away.

421
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,666
Wait a minute. Uncle a minute.

422
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:33,136
You idiots. Why did you stop him?

423
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:34,675
He's my relative.

424
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,074
Come on, everybody. Hurry up.

425
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,740
Who are you they?

426
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,975
That's a big story. Since you
told me that you'll tell me later.

427
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:42,413
Even I will tell you later.

428
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:43,678
Let's go.

429
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:51,493
<i>Pooh?</i>

430
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:55,159
Aunt, I don't want to marry him.

431
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:59,063
That's why I'm telling you.
Run away from here.

432
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,567
I will help you.

433
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,296
Pack your luggage. - Okay.

434
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:03,996
I'll right back. - Okay.

435
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:18,280
Where are you going?

436
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:21,152
I'm the bride's friend.
I want to meet her.

437
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:23,793
Meet her when she comes downstairs.

438
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,657
Boss, she'll be leaving
with her my brother to Dubai.

439
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:27,797
It's getting late for the flight.

440
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:29,193
I'll meet her just for few minutes.

441
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:33,000
Let's go. Come on.

442
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,303
He only asked two questions,
I would've spread this on him..

443
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:41,409
...had he asked the third one.
- Alright. I will wait right here.

444
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,806
You go and bring her. - Okay.

445
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,947
We are putting our lives in stake.

446
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,640
Excuse me. When's the bride's room?

447
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:49,251
Second room from the right. - Okay.

448
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,092
Wait a minute.

449
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:04,423
Who are you?

450
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,469
One. - What do you want?

451
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,298
Two .

452
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,770
You're.. We are Gopi's..

453
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,636
What? - Three.

454
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,139
No.

455
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:20,774
Why did you spray?

456
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,077
She asked me three questions.

457
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,877
Idiot. Put the burqa on her.

458
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:29,325
I wonder what she eats.
She's really heavy.

459
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,256
What happened to our
Rajappds daughter-in-law?

460
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,556
Rajappds daughter-in-law puked.

461
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,792
Get her treated and
bring her back soon. - Okay.

462
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,936
Careful - Let's go.

463
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,494
What happened?
- She's from diarrhea. Get going.

464
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:44,731
I met your son a while ago.

465
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,433
He's so handsome.

466
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,273
What do you mean?
He went to Australia six months ago.

467
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:54,850
Stop kidding.
He was accompanied by a Muslim lady.

468
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,067
<i>5m?-</i>

469
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,343
Is it important to
get married to a stranger..

470
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,840
...or get married to
the girl who you love?

471
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:22,842
What are you saying?

472
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:25,140
We brought your girlfriend
putting our lives in stake..

473
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:26,681
...but here you're getting
married to some other girl.

474
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,180
How dare you slap me?

475
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:30,286
How dare you slap my husband?

476
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,614
Husband? Why did you slap me?

477
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:36,658
How dare you stop me from
getting married to the girl I love?

478
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:39,388
She's your girlfriend?
Then who is that girl?

479
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,087
What do you mean?

480
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,228
Gopi, who is this girl?

481
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:45,902
First tell me who is that girl?

482
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:47,695
We picked her up
from the wedding hall.

483
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,806
Even she was picked
from the wedding hall.

484
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:50,963
Wait a minute.

485
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,735
What is the name of wedding
hall you mentioned? - R.A.R.

486
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:56,237
What name did you say? - R.R.R.

487
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,041
Darn it.

488
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,580
Sorry about that.

489
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,387
Now what do we do about that girl?

490
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:25,334
Move. Look her sleeping.

491
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:26,737
Get up.

492
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,113
Who.. who are you?

493
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,485
He's your brother-in-law,
he's your uncle..

494
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,143
...and he's your uncle's son.

495
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:40,755
We mistook you to be
our friend's girlfriend.

496
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:42,483
Really? Thank you.

497
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:44,127
Thank you so much.
- Thank you?

498
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:45,818
She has gone insane after
spraying the chloroform.

499
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:48,487
No, no.
I didn't want to marry him.

500
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:51,260
As it is, I wanted to run away.
But you saved me.

501
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:52,766
So sweet of you.

502
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:55,371
Will you do me one more favor?
- One more favor?

503
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,167
Will you please take me to Mysore?
- That's impossible.

504
00:29:58,363 --> 00:29:59,967
We will drop you back
to the wedding hall.

505
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,736
In that case, you will not
be able to go out of this town.

506
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,971
Why? - I will show you. Come on.

507
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:07,548
Let's see what she's trying to say.

508
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:08,912
Look there.

509
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:11,448
Look there.

510
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:15,383
Probably, there's shooting going on.

511
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:17,583
Not shooting.
They are looking for me.

512
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:19,785
If they learn that it
was you who abducted me..

513
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,328
...they will hack you to pieces.

514
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:25,161
Didn't I tell you we are
putting ourselves into trouble?

515
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:27,359
Alright. I will take you
wherever you want. - Let's go.

516
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,594
Let's go. - Let's go.

517
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,206
You're such an emotional fool.
- Get in.

518
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:32,431
Hurry I-PI-

519
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:34,975
Bye. - To hell with you.

520
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,407
<i>BYE- - Bye, Raam.</i>

521
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:44,212
Faster.

522
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:45,846
Hey.

523
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,085
They are following us.

524
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:50,149
Come on.

525
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,458
Drive carefully.

526
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,011
Drive carefully.

527
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,744
This is grandpa's car.
Drive carefully. - Quiet.

528
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,514
Faster.

529
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:24,349
Darn it.

530
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:27,019
Hurry up. Come. Come on.

531
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:28,357
Wait. - Come on.

532
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,234
Boss, there's nobody
in the van. - What?

533
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:35,632
Let's go.

534
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,376
Why did you leave my car?

535
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:42,011
What I do now?

536
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:47,111
Get him!

537
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,081
Hurry I-PI-

538
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,093
How dare you run?

539
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,538
Come on. Come on. Run! Run!

540
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,522
This way. Come on.

541
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,079
Is everyone there?

542
00:32:57,109 --> 00:32:58,520
Where is that girl?

543
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,016
Can't you see her?

544
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:02,214
Not she, the bride.

545
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:05,089
We escaped with great difficulty.

546
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,820
We should lucky.

547
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,760
Poor girl.

548
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:11,127
Just shut up. Listen to me.

549
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,735
If she gets caught,
they will get her married.

550
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:17,429
But if we get caught,
they will hack us to pieces.

551
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:20,076
Pal, I'm very hlll19rY-

552
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:21,300
Let's find a hotel.

553
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:22,968
Look for her.

554
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:26,115
Oh my God. They are here.

555
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:28,308
Run! Run! Run!

556
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:35,588
I think we betrayed her.
We should've brought her along.

557
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:38,785
Thanks for at least
having sympathy on my car.

558
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,726
I'm not talking about your car,
but the girl.

559
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,661
We are lucky to be alive.

560
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,096
Why are you so concerned
about that girl?

561
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:47,794
Listen to me.

562
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:49,529
They were actually
forcing her to get married.

563
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:53,736
Did you make an agreement with her?

564
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:55,468
Sir, bill. - Give it to him.

565
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,078
Give it to me.

566
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:01,544
Chicken pilaf, mutton pilaf,
chicken fry, chicken 65..

567
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,845
...chicken 75, fish fry..

568
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,823
Why did you eat so much?

569
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:09,959
I didn't so much.
- Not he, it's them.

570
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:11,525
Who's that?

571
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:21,968
Will we not get rid of her?

572
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,304
You're such a coward.

573
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:28,638
My girlfriend knows me well.
- Shut up.

574
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,973
Shut up.
You left a helpless girl to suffer.

575
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:33,314
Haven't you watched Rajkuamar's
films(Kannada actor)?

576
00:34:33,472 --> 00:34:37,579
He rescues the heroines..
- He was a powerful hero.

577
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,187
He has fans how supported him.

578
00:34:39,344 --> 00:34:41,187
We can't afford to put ourselves
into trouble trying to be him.

579
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:43,223
Those goons seem
to be really dangerous.

580
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:46,658
Darn it.
I thought India was.. - Stop it.

581
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:49,024
Don't you dare underestimate India.

582
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:51,167
You want to go Mysore, right?

583
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:53,098
I will.. - Don't get emotional.

584
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:56,068
Listen to me. - Gunduraju.

585
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:59,641
I will do any thing for my country.
Let's go.

586
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,868
Thank you so much. I'm Pooja.

587
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,410
I..

588
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:06,549
Just a minute.
Come on. - Leave my hand.

589
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:10,015
That girl's men seem
to be very dangerous.

590
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:13,418
Let's not tell our
original names. Okay?

591
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:15,057
Okay. - Come on.

592
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:16,749
Anything personal?

593
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:18,087
Any problem because of me?

594
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,728
No, nothing like that.

595
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:21,762
<i>By the by, my name is Guru Khan.</i>

596
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:22,954
Yograj Bhatt. - Hello.

597
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,099
Sadhu Kokila. - Yes.

598
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:25,564
She is Malashree.

599
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:27,203
Tell her my name too.

600
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,430
He's Tippe. - What?

601
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:30,663
Tippayya.

602
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:32,900
Everyone remember their
names correctly. - What?

603
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,099
Remember their names?

604
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:36,542
I was not telling them, but you.
You remember all their names.

605
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:39,147
Tippayya, go and pay the bill.

606
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:41,512
Why are you taking this? - Tip.

607
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:43,914
For whom?
- For useless people like you.

608
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,349
Stop. Stop.

609
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:51,290
Idiot. He would've killed me now..
you could see me only in photo then.

610
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:52,621
It would've been good
if you would've died.

611
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:55,526
Hello. No one will give
lift to people like you.

612
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,462
Tippayya, go behind.
Malashree, come with me.

613
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,961
Come on. Look, what she's telling us.

614
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:11,180
Hello, lift please. Lift please.

615
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,213
Such beautiful girls on the highway.

616
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:14,850
Stop. - Lift please.

617
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,610
Sir, please. Give us a lift.

618
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,814
What can I do for you?
- Will you give us a lift?

619
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,287
Only lift? If you want,
I can sacrifice my life for you.

620
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:24,427
Then we'll have to
drop you to the cemetery.

621
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:27,720
You talk too much,
but very good joke.

622
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:29,023
Please, come. Come. Come. Come.

623
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:30,723
Thank you. - Come on.

624
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:32,067
Come inside.

625
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:33,668
Sit. Please, sit close to me.

626
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:36,635
Is this a luggage van?
Come on, get down everyone.

627
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:39,172
Sir, they all are with us.
- Are they all with you?

628
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,139
Where should I drop
you and throw this luggage?

629
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:42,835
Just drop me to Mysore. - Okay.

630
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,104
Uncle, drop us to Bangalore.

631
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:46,111
<i>Why are you addressing me as uncle?
My name is Santosh.</i>

632
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:49,285
When everyone is happy with me,
they call me as happy.

633
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:50,852
By the way,
why are you in a wedding attire?

634
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:53,011
Her parents tried to get her
married to an older man like you..

635
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:54,384
...so, she eloped from her house,
Mr. Happy.

636
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,116
Who's this empty box?

637
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:57,315
His name is Tippayya.

638
00:36:57,516 --> 00:36:58,517
He is Ayya (father)
of Tippe (garbage).

639
00:36:58,683 --> 00:36:59,957
Which gutter did you find him in?

640
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:02,358
He helped me coming
out of the marriage hall.

641
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,161
Is it? Your name sounds very old,
but you gave a new idea.

642
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:09,305
Okay, shall we leave now? - Hello,
the gear is there. - Sorry, sir.

643
00:37:09,494 --> 00:37:10,939
Sorry, I couldn't know
as it was a bit lower.

644
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:12,803
Feel free. Don't worry.

645
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:15,668
See dear,
you should be happy in your life.

646
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:17,847
Mr. Happy, where are you going to?

647
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:19,607
I am going to enjoy my weekend.

648
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:21,944
What do you do the whole week?
- I wait for the weekend.

649
00:37:22,107 --> 00:37:23,586
That's the reason, you've become fat.

650
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:26,449
You can understand
one thing by this. - What?

651
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:28,647
If you put on weight by
eating from your parents money..

652
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:30,690
...it will be difficult
to carry you to the cemetery.

653
00:37:34,386 --> 00:37:37,492
A good junction. Would
you like to have any cold drinks?

654
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,558
Just one commercial break now.

655
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:45,372
Excuse me,
do you have any western outfits?

656
00:37:45,564 --> 00:37:46,565
What?

657
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:49,805
It is not enough if we know
English even they should know.

658
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:50,946
Sir, do you have foreign
dresses with you?

659
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:52,740
All these are modern dresses, sir.

660
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:02,781
Switch off that devotional song.

661
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:04,824
Do you have any disco music song?

662
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,586
It's there.
Have a look. - Okay, thank you.

663
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:15,700
Yes? - There's a red jeep
parked outside. Is it yours?

664
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:18,067
Yes. That's my own vehicle.

665
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:19,173
It is not for sale, sorry.

666
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,503
I don't want that.
While on your way..

667
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,009
...did you see this girl anywhere?

668
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:25,613
Not just saw her,
but gave her a lift too.

669
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,511
Somebody give me a lift.

670
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:29,652
I like that song very much.
You want lift? - No.

671
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:33,288
Thank you..
- Did she have guys with her?

672
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,951
Don't get confused.
One girl and four guys.

673
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:38,685
Only five members, okay?
- Where are they now?

674
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:40,863
Why? - Just tell me where they are?

675
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:43,260
Hello, go and do your work.

676
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,461
Hello, didn't you leave till now?

677
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,530
Will you tell me
or should I chop you?

678
00:38:51,463 --> 00:38:53,534
There.. in the clothes shop.

679
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:56,042
Hey, get him along while coming.

680
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,581
Yograj Bhatt, take this.

681
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,819
Wow, how beautiful, isn't it?

682
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:08,457
Pack that. - Okay, sir.

683
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:10,923
Thanks Tippayya.
- I should thank you instead.

684
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:12,561
You've selected a very good gift.

685
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:13,889
Isn't this for me?

686
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:17,294
We've given lift to you, that's more.
Why you need a gift now?

687
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,268
Come. Come. Everyone, run.

688
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:27,307
Let go off me!

689
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:28,939
Did you see this girl around?

690
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,602
Yes, sir.
She bought clothes from here.

691
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,510
Didn't I tell you?

692
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:35,912
Come on,
let's hide in this narrow lane.

693
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:37,376
Come on, get inside.

694
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:38,883
Hey, let go off me.

695
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:41,149
You go there,
you go near the bus stop.

696
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,791
I'll make a call and come.
- Boss. - Thanks, boss.

697
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:44,187
We don't know anyone
else other than that girl.

698
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:46,886
He knows.
He'll be with us until we find her.

699
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:49,054
Sir, listen to me. Let go off me.

700
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:05,541
What do we do now?

701
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:07,774
Let's be here for some time. - What?

702
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,813
I mean, let's stay
here until they leave.

703
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,887
Let's decide later what
has to be done. That's all.

704
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,155
Your hair smells great.

705
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:18,658
That's perfume.

706
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,921
Which brand?
- Don't try to take advantage.

707
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,565
We can hardly breath in this
place how can I take advantage?

708
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:25,860
Oh, my jeep. My vehicle!

709
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,100
You've rammed in it. Hey you.

710
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:30,398
You are taking me
away from my vehicle.

711
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:33,267
Recharge this.

712
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,278
Hey! - Come on, let's run! Let's run!

713
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:51,588
Come fast. Hurry up! Hurry up!

714
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,660
Hey! - Give me your hand. Come on.

715
00:41:09,868 --> 00:41:12,348
Hey! Stop!

716
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:14,517
Come on, get in.
Come on! Come. Come.

717
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,278
Let go off my waist.

718
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,078
Forget that. Come on, hurry up.

719
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:19,847
Come. Come fast.

720
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:21,183
Let go off me!

721
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,590
Come. Come fast!

722
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:27,925
Come fast.

723
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:29,997
He's coming closer. Hurry up.

724
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:49,779
Which way do we go now?

725
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:53,454
I think, we'll get it this side. -
Hello, how many times do I tell you?

726
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:54,646
Why are you getting angry now.

727
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:56,189
If I would've caught
hold of your waist".

728
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:57,382
...we could've boarded the train.

729
00:41:57,549 --> 00:41:59,426
You screamed at me for doing so,
and look where we landed.

730
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:01,393
Do you expect me to stay
quiet when you catch my waist?

731
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:04,590
Do you think you have
Shilpa Shetty's figure?

732
00:42:04,756 --> 00:42:07,635
I don't need to do all this for you.
- Hello.. don't do all this drama.

733
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:10,636
When I said I don't want friends,
you convinced me.

734
00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:12,069
<i>You were spinning stories
to me near the inn.</i>

735
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,834
I know all that was for me.

736
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:15,341
Do you know everything?

737
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,706
I've seen many like you.

738
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:19,882
I thought of helping
you as you are a girl..

739
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:21,880
...but you are talking too much.

740
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,919
Get lost!
You go your way and I'll go mine.

741
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,281
Get lost!

742
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:30,289
I am not scared of jungles. I
had been to Amazon forest in America.

743
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:39,633
Help! Tippayya!

744
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:42,465
Help! Help!

745
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,968
Where's she?

746
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,935
Thinks like she's
caught by Veerappan.

747
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,507
Tippayya!

748
00:42:49,534 --> 00:42:51,377
Tippayya! Please, help.

749
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:54,908
You are still here?
I thought you died by now.

750
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,711
Help me, please. Tippayya!

751
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:59,354
Stay there.
Keep talking. Hold it tightly.

752
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,156
I am coming.

753
00:43:04,182 --> 00:43:05,991
You found a good place to hang out.

754
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:07,959
Help me, Tippayya. Please, help.

755
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:09,689
You had been to Amazon, didn't you?

756
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:10,865
This shouldn't be a problem for you.

757
00:43:11,022 --> 00:43:13,263
Please. Don't keep all
that things in mind now.

758
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,562
If you help me, I'll salute you.

759
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:17,569
This happens if you hurt
some good people like me.

760
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,469
What happened now?

761
00:43:19,664 --> 00:43:21,337
If I have to help you,
I need to hold you by your waist".

762
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:22,510
...and if I do that, you'll scold me.

763
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:24,704
Holding waist is not
more than saving my life.

764
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,041
I won't tell you anything
if you hold me anywhere.

765
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:27,910
First, save me. Please.

766
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:34,412
You look thin, but you are heavy.

767
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:38,049
What is it? Is it head weight,
bone weight, or attitude?

768
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:41,355
What did you say?
- If you get angry, I'll leave you.

769
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:43,658
No. no. Sorry. Sorry.

770
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,708
This problem wouldn't have aroused..

771
00:43:54,866 --> 00:43:56,174
...if you would've let
me hold your waist earlier.

772
00:43:56,334 --> 00:43:57,904
We could've gone in a train.

773
00:43:58,069 --> 00:44:00,413
This waist.. - Shut up.

774
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:03,381
If you allowed me
to touch your waist now..

775
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:05,645
...you would've allowed me to touch
it while we were boarding the train.

776
00:44:06,244 --> 00:44:08,952
The thing is that,
first time when I hold your waist..

777
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:12,356
Oh.. please, stop this topic
now and talk something else.

778
00:44:12,517 --> 00:44:14,258
What do I talk now?

779
00:44:14,452 --> 00:44:15,863
Nothing?

780
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,088
Malashree said that..

781
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:18,893
...you got bowled seeing
an unconscious girl in the car.

782
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:21,798
That's the reason I say..
don't say anything to these women.

783
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:24,303
They reveal everything.
They can't hide a secret..

784
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,567
Forget that.. I don't
know who's the girl you love..

785
00:44:27,732 --> 00:44:28,904
...you don't know where she is..

786
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,602
...you even don't know
whether you'll meet her or not.

787
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,179
But I met her. - Where?

788
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,815
Here. - What?

789
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:36,045
I mean, in my heart.

790
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:37,481
Okay. Okay.

791
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,710
Even if you meet her..

792
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:40,821
...don't know whether she'll
fall in love with you or not.

793
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:43,356
Look, I don't have
any answer for that.

794
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,892
Trust is the key of love.
I want that.

795
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:49,862
Tippayya, like your name..
you have hay in your head.

796
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:53,263
Thanks.. in the morning, the waist..

797
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:56,767
Please, I am feeling sleepy.
Good night.

798
00:45:07,405 --> 00:45:08,713
Where did she go?

799
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,757
Hey, what are you doing here?
I got so tensed.

800
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:22,898
Why did you get tensed?
That too for me?

801
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:24,623
Don't you think I'll get tensed.

802
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:25,893
Fine.. give me your hand.

803
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:28,768
'I'll teach you a lesson now.
You show attitude to me..'

804
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:36,705
Hey Cadbury's.

805
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,716
Hey Cadbury's.

806
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:43,744
Are you out of your mind?

807
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:46,945
Are you out of your mind?

808
00:45:48,012 --> 00:45:50,288
Are you a fool!

809
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:53,752
Loser.

810
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,690
A big loser.

811
00:45:56,888 --> 00:45:59,164
A big loser.

812
00:46:06,664 --> 00:46:09,770
Hey, mother's daughter.

813
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:13,007
Get lost!

814
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:16,150
Hey, father's daughter.

815
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,353
Go! Go!

816
00:46:20,178 --> 00:46:23,318
You are crazy about
Cadbury's guy like us.

817
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:26,427
Or there's no demand
for you at all.

818
00:46:26,584 --> 00:46:28,928
Excuse me, Tippayya-

819
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,360
The face of Cadbury's.

820
00:46:33,057 --> 00:46:35,503
You are like strawberry crush.

821
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,667
You come behind us.

822
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,372
Hey, mother's daughter.

823
00:46:44,335 --> 00:46:45,712
Get lost!

824
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:49,175
Hey, father's daughter.

825
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:52,183
Go! Go!

826
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:35,790
If we smile at you
and meet you in evenings..

827
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:39,093
...you'll lip lock with us.

828
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:42,362
If we fall in love with you..

829
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:45,303
...you almost kill us.

830
00:47:45,463 --> 00:47:48,569
Hello. - Tell me.
- You are like fevicol.

831
00:47:48,766 --> 00:47:52,043
Hello. - Tell me.
- You all are beautiful.

832
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:55,649
Even if we try to understand
for hundred years..

833
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:58,650
...we can't understand
a girl's smile.

834
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:01,221
You are Jeans pant Jogiyya.

835
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,352
You are talking like a poet.

836
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:07,626
Tillllayya, you are a fool.

837
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:10,963
You try to show attitude.

838
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:45,025
You see the guy's background..

839
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:48,328
...and you fall for him.

840
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:51,632
Even if we smile at you..

841
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:54,469
...you break the signal.

842
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:57,805
Hello. - Tell me.
- You are like virus.

843
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:01,245
Hello. - Tell me.
- Even you are not pure.

844
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:04,779
She will talk about your history.

845
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:07,854
She'll betray you at the end.

846
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:10,822
Excuse me Tippayya.

847
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:13,785
The history is false.

848
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:17,192
You exist because of us.

849
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:20,301
You all are useless.

850
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,939
Hey, mother's daughter.

851
00:49:25,663 --> 00:49:27,199
Get lost!

852
00:49:27,598 --> 00:49:30,602
Hey, father's daughter.

853
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:33,577
Go! Go!

854
00:49:34,605 --> 00:49:37,745
You are crazy about
Cadbury's guy like us.

855
00:49:37,942 --> 00:49:40,855
Or there's no demand
for you at all.

856
00:49:41,012 --> 00:49:43,356
Excuse me, Tippayya-

857
00:49:44,248 --> 00:49:46,751
The face of Cadbury's.

858
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:49,792
You are like strawberry crush.

859
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,529
You come behind us.

860
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,327
What about you, Tippayya?

861
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,599
You should know
something about me first.

862
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:00,469
My name is not Tippayya, but Raam.

863
00:50:00,631 --> 00:50:01,632
Why did you lie to me then?

864
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:03,244
The inn that we were staying in,
everyone..

865
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:15,752
Hey"

866
00:51:56,347 --> 00:51:57,985
Anyways, we are in the bus stop,
let's flee from here.

867
00:51:58,148 --> 00:51:59,354
Shut up.

868
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:01,854
Thank God, you are here.

869
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:04,425
What's the matter?
- Nothing, forget it.

870
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:06,864
Take this.
Your ornaments are in this bag.

871
00:52:07,024 --> 00:52:08,503
Just check if it is there.

872
00:52:11,028 --> 00:52:14,009
Bye Raam.
I'll miss you a lot. Keep in touch.

873
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:15,108
How? - What?

874
00:52:15,266 --> 00:52:18,611
You told me to keep in touch. - I've
given my e-mail ID to Malashree.

875
00:52:18,803 --> 00:52:20,248
I'll give you.
Come on. We're already late.

876
00:52:20,404 --> 00:52:22,213
Bye. - Bye Pooja.. - Bye. Bye.

877
00:52:22,373 --> 00:52:24,284
Stay in the waiting room
until your friend comes.

878
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:27,945
'Attention, passengers.
The bus leaving to Mysore..'

879
00:52:40,858 --> 00:52:42,394
Hello? - Hi Gautam, Pooja here.

880
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,732
Hi Pooja, how are you? - I am fine.

881
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:46,236
I escaped from the marriage hall.

882
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:47,500
Is my passport and visa ready?

883
00:52:47,698 --> 00:52:48,768
Pooja, it is still in process.

884
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:50,275
It will be ready in 15 days.

885
00:52:50,434 --> 00:52:52,505
What? It will take more 15 days?

886
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,343
Why? What's the matter?

887
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:56,678
Nothing.
Just get the passport ready soon.

888
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,319
Where will you stay for 15 days?

889
00:52:58,409 --> 00:53:00,446
I'll stay in my friend,
Savita's house.

890
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:04,023
Pooja, her entire family has
shifted to Chicago one week back.

891
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,489
What will you do now?

892
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:07,651
Forget about me.
Don't worry. I'll do something.

893
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:09,627
But please, get the passport ready.
Okay? - Okay.

894
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:11,095
Okay. Bye. - BYE-

895
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:50,638
The passport is not ready yet.

896
00:53:50,828 --> 00:53:52,501
He said it would
take 10-15 days more.

897
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:54,437
Even my friend is not in town.

898
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:56,202
I don't know what to do.

899
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:58,904
And these people"
tell me one thing..

900
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,572
...why did you return when
you all had boarded the bus?

901
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:04,951
I felt like giving
this to you as my souvenir.

902
00:54:05,843 --> 00:54:07,117
Thank you.

903
00:54:07,278 --> 00:54:10,623
What's this? She's going
to stay with us for 10-15 days more?

904
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:13,318
Just for two days,
I felt like a tour to hell.

905
00:54:13,484 --> 00:54:15,760
Shut up. I'll give you
an idea for you advantage.

906
00:54:15,953 --> 00:54:19,093
Is it okay with you? - Okay.

907
00:54:19,456 --> 00:54:22,767
What's your problem?
You want to get married, don't you?

908
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,803
I know. - You have
to get him married.

909
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:27,841
Brother-in-law, it is not like that.

910
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,207
I am so unfortunate.

911
00:54:34,405 --> 00:54:37,443
Look, if we post your
photo in shaadi.com..

912
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:40,645
...the queries came to
us were more than 60 years old.

913
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:42,482
We are tired of
looking a girl for you.

914
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,991
Now, somebody has
to come looking for you.

915
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,654
There's somebody at the door.
Go and have a look.

916
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:50,924
Okay. Okay.

917
00:54:51,088 --> 00:54:52,260
Who is it?

918
00:54:57,628 --> 00:55:01,303
Hi Rama.. - How do you know my name?

919
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:03,569
Not only your name,
I know everything about you.

920
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:06,748
Is it? Your name? - Pooja.

921
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:07,939
Pooja.

922
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:10,949
Come. Come.

923
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:15,021
Oh beautiful damsel, come to me.

924
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:18,126
Come. Come.

925
00:55:18,749 --> 00:55:22,287
Come to me, 0 beautiful.

926
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:28,665
Come. Come.

927
00:55:30,027 --> 00:55:31,904
Please, welcome. Give me your bag.

928
00:55:33,597 --> 00:55:35,042
Hello uncle Raghu.

929
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:40,410
Raghu uncle? Only Ganapati
priest calls me as Raghu.

930
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:41,914
Uncle, he sent me here.

931
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:43,710
Come. Have a seat.

932
00:55:45,943 --> 00:55:47,445
Hello aunt Laxmi.

933
00:55:47,645 --> 00:55:48,646
Hello, dear.

934
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:50,723
Hello aunt Sangeeta.

935
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:51,790
Hello.

936
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:53,223
Hello aunt Bharti.

937
00:55:53,384 --> 00:55:54,795
Hello, dear.

938
00:55:54,952 --> 00:55:57,489
You are uncle Ragahava,
isn't it? - Yes.

939
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,167
Hey, PUPPY--

940
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:03,896
Even that's come
from priest's hermitage.

941
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:05,767
It got close to her so soon.

942
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:07,943
I am sorry.
I didn't tell you why I came here.

943
00:56:08,132 --> 00:56:10,635
You came here for me,
didn't you? - Rama!

944
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:14,113
My mom and dad died in an accident.

945
00:56:14,271 --> 00:56:16,273
So, priest brought me up.

946
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,947
I've got a seat in
the medical college too.

947
00:56:19,143 --> 00:56:21,248
But it will be 15 days
by the time the college reopens.

948
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:24,358
So, I've to make arrangements
for the books and hostel.

949
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:26,619
Why do you want to stay in a
hostel when we have a such big house?

950
00:56:26,817 --> 00:56:28,421
Am I right, brother-in-law?
- Absolutely.

951
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:30,997
Priest is like
incarnation of God to us.

952
00:56:31,155 --> 00:56:34,796
Not only 15 days, you can
stay here as many days as you want.

953
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:22,445
Take the blessings.

954
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:36,920
You are the devotee
who sacrificed your son..

955
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:41,830
...entered the wheel
and killed the enemies.

956
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:48,734
Uncle is so proud to see the shield.

957
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:50,843
Yes, he always does that.
Since childhood he's..

958
00:57:51,001 --> 00:57:53,140
...crazy about drama and movies.

959
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:57,342
In fact, he got a state
award for playing Duryodhana.

960
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:03,953
Do you know who awarded him?
His favorite actor.

961
00:58:04,114 --> 00:58:05,320
Dr. Raj kuma r.

962
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:08,429
So, he doesn't step out
of the house without seeing it.

963
00:58:13,557 --> 00:58:15,059
Ask him why did he come here?

964
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:18,001
You are talking to the people
who eloped and got married..

965
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:19,697
...why aren't you talking to me?

966
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:20,705
So, I came here.

967
00:58:20,898 --> 00:58:22,309
She did everything without knowing.

968
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,410
No, she did everything intentionally.

969
00:58:24,568 --> 00:58:25,911
She threatened n1e at
the last moment saying..

970
00:58:26,103 --> 00:58:27,741
...if I don't marry Bhaskar, I'll die.

971
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:29,542
That too our house girl.
She shouldn't die.

972
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:30,741
So, I got them married.

973
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:33,285
So, you stopped sending
money order to me.

974
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:35,616
When I went to the doctor
for gastric problem"

975
00:58:35,779 --> 00:58:37,725
...he said,
I am an anemic and my bones are weak.

976
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:43,125
He needs a big medical shop
for the problems he said. Isn't it?

977
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,663
I didn't have money even for 30 ml.

978
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:47,267
Brother-in-law, did you hear that?

979
00:58:47,424 --> 00:58:48,801
He's talking about 30 ml.

980
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:52,532
Hello.. 30 ml doesn't
mean liquor, Rama.

981
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:55,767
I am talking about medicine. Tell
n1e if you are still angry with n1e.

982
00:58:55,933 --> 00:58:58,072
I'll go and sleep
under a flyover. - oh.

983
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:01,875
Pooja, you were brought
up by the priest.

984
00:59:02,072 --> 00:59:04,518
If you say,
it is like priest commanding us.

985
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:07,245
Tell me.. can we forgive him?

986
00:59:08,078 --> 00:59:10,217
Actually, you shouldn't forgive him.

987
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,156
But by seeing his
face it seems as though..

988
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:14,658
...he can't stay without you.

989
00:59:14,818 --> 00:59:16,354
Uncle, forgive him.

990
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:19,467
Okay, I'll forgive
him as you are telling me.

991
00:59:19,623 --> 00:59:20,897
Tell him to go inside.

992
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:23,470
Uncle, thanks a lot.
Thank you. Sorry, uncle.

993
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,697
I won't repeat this mistake again.
Daddy.. daddy..

994
00:59:25,863 --> 00:59:29,208
Your dad is here.
- Sorry.. Daddy.. daddy..

995
00:59:30,367 --> 00:59:31,903
Come on, let's go inside.

996
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:39,214
Did you see that dear?
Everyone is so happy to see him.

997
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:42,316
He was away from us because
of my sister's daughter..

998
00:59:42,479 --> 00:59:46,894
...he's always like that.
He solves everybody's problems.

999
00:59:47,384 --> 00:59:48,590
Good boy.

1000
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:54,732
Very good. You acted very well.

1001
00:59:54,892 --> 00:59:57,873
But be careful.
Everyone are brilliant in my house.

1002
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:01,166
Fine.. do you know
how to do hiccups. - What?

1003
01:00:01,364 --> 01:00:03,810
Oh sorry, you are from America,
so you won't understand this.

1004
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:06,470
Hiccups" - Why?

1005
01:00:06,637 --> 01:00:09,174
From now on whenever
you have to talk to me..

1006
01:00:09,373 --> 01:00:10,511
...act like you've got hiccups.

1007
01:00:10,674 --> 01:00:12,244
That will be our secret code. Okay?

1008
01:00:12,409 --> 01:00:13,387
Okay, TipPaYYa-

1009
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:15,489
My name is not Tippayya, but Raam.

1010
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:17,522
Okay. Okay. - Yeah. Yeah.

1011
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:36,234
He's got hurt on the head
and have lost lots of blood..

1012
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:38,401
...so he's in coma.
- What's coma?

1013
01:00:38,602 --> 01:00:40,513
He'll be alive,
but can't recognize anyone..

1014
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:41,978
...can't talk to anyone.

1015
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:44,141
Just assume him
to be a living corpse.

1016
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:48,312
No, get him in his senses soon.
You have to.

1017
01:00:48,512 --> 01:00:49,957
Before Narsimha comes to his senses..

1018
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:52,184
...the man who was reason
for all this should die.

1019
01:00:52,516 --> 01:00:53,790
Okay, sir.

1020
01:00:55,185 --> 01:00:58,394
Aunt, it is like this, isn't it?
- Sister, the junior priest is here.

1021
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,441
Where did he go?

1022
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:13,538
Why did you lie to us?

1023
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:18,075
Lied.. I didn't lie to you.

1024
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:21,516
Did you see? Your hiccups stopped.

1025
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,351
This is called shock treatment.

1026
01:01:23,547 --> 01:01:26,027
I am an expert in
giving shock treatment.

1027
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:34,696
What's the matter?

1028
01:01:34,991 --> 01:01:37,767
I heard junior priest is here.
I'll definitely get caught now.

1029
01:01:37,961 --> 01:01:39,634
What do I do?

1030
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:42,537
Fried rice. Fried rice.

1031
01:01:42,733 --> 01:01:44,178
If you mix curd
rice with fried rice..

1032
01:01:44,334 --> 01:01:45,438
...you'll get a new kind of rice.

1033
01:01:45,602 --> 01:01:46,774
Fried rice.

1034
01:01:48,105 --> 01:01:49,914
Priest, if you would've
told me you are coming here..

1035
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:52,143
...I've would've brought
you here in my bike.

1036
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:56,758
I've given up all my desires
after I became a priest.

1037
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:58,392
I only have my life with me now.

1038
01:01:58,515 --> 01:02:00,222
Why do you want to kill me?

1039
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:03,728
How are you?
- All are fine since Pooja came here.

1040
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:05,389
Pooja? Who's she?

1041
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:09,264
It was sent by senior priest.
' PUPPY?

1042
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:11,099
Don't call it as puppy-

1043
01:02:11,261 --> 01:02:13,104
Uncle has named it as Pooja.

1044
01:02:13,263 --> 01:02:15,834
Oh, like a cow in
front of Lord Shiva..

1045
01:02:15,999 --> 01:02:18,206
...your uncle wants a puppy..

1046
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:19,938
You are addressing it as puppy again.

1047
01:02:20,137 --> 01:02:21,377
You'll get into
trouble if you do this.

1048
01:02:22,205 --> 01:02:25,277
Greetings, priest. - Greetings.

1049
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:29,255
My master has send
this oblation to you.

1050
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:32,016
His love is protecting
all of us till now.

1051
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:33,216
Please, have a seat.

1052
01:02:33,383 --> 01:02:35,886
Where's Pooja?
- She's coming. Have coffee.

1053
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:40,093
Priest.. did your master
ask anything about Pooja?

1054
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:45,296
Why will he ask? He knows
it will be safe in your hands.

1055
01:02:45,462 --> 01:02:46,600
He knows it.

1056
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,403
Pooja has become our family member.

1057
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,169
She's a very nice girl.

1058
01:02:51,335 --> 01:02:53,941
'Rich people are unpredictable.'

1059
01:02:54,571 --> 01:02:55,982
It has put on weight, isn't it?

1060
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:59,052
She just looks fat,
but she doesn't eat at all.

1061
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:00,744
She feels shy.

1062
01:03:00,911 --> 01:03:03,391
'Do even dogs feel shy?'

1063
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:04,456
It won't bite, isn't it?

1064
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:07,527
She isn't a small girl to bite you.
It has to be married now.

1065
01:03:07,684 --> 01:03:09,459
'They want to get the dog married?'

1066
01:03:11,655 --> 01:03:14,898
Is priest looking
for alliance for Pooja?

1067
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:18,072
'I think all have become crazy and
has to be admitted in the asylum.'

1068
01:03:18,829 --> 01:03:20,866
He doesn't have such plans yet.

1069
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:23,443
It will surely find a mate one day.

1070
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,340
Anyways, it is a free bird, isn't it?

1071
01:03:25,502 --> 01:03:29,109
Correct. She doesn't have parents.

1072
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:31,943
If I stay here one minute more,
I'll go crazy.

1073
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:33,913
I shall leave now.

1074
01:03:34,077 --> 01:03:37,923
Give our regards to
Ganapati priest. - Sure.

1075
01:03:38,081 --> 01:03:39,287
Have food and leave.

1076
01:03:39,449 --> 01:03:40,985
I am observing a fast today.

1077
01:03:43,954 --> 01:03:45,934
Who's this girl?

1078
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:54,101
She's a new maid of our house.
Her name is Kumari.

1079
01:03:54,698 --> 01:03:55,870
She's good.

1080
01:03:59,636 --> 01:04:00,808
It's okay.

1081
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:14,589
Oh God.

1082
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:36,377
Who? Who did this?

1083
01:04:36,573 --> 01:04:38,314
Who broke this?

1084
01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:40,615
Uncle, it is me.

1085
01:04:40,777 --> 01:04:41,881
What?

1086
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,155
By mistake, it fell down.

1087
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:46,850
By mistake?

1088
01:04:47,183 --> 01:04:50,255
Do you know what memories mean?
Do you know their value?

1089
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:52,263
You say you've been
brought up by the priest.

1090
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:55,868
...don't you know how to
behave in somebody else's house.

1091
01:04:56,826 --> 01:04:58,203
Even you are out of your mind.

1092
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:01,638
Why are you so lenient
towards the guest?

1093
01:05:01,798 --> 01:05:05,109
You are a guest here.
Behave as a guest.

1094
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:07,907
That's the reason, I am leaving you.

1095
01:05:19,683 --> 01:05:22,061
Brother-in-law.. - What is it?

1096
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:27,364
It was not Pooja who
broke the shield. - What? Who?

1097
01:05:28,158 --> 01:05:29,364
It was I.

1098
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:35,205
Pooja, come here for a minute.

1099
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:40,647
My family members fear
to tell the truth to me.

1100
01:05:40,804 --> 01:05:42,283
Why did you lie to me?

1101
01:05:42,505 --> 01:05:46,112
Uncle, your family
members respect you a lot..

1102
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:48,016
...they even fear you.

1103
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:51,648
Their hearts are delicate
than the shield that broke.

1104
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:55,529
If you would've told
something to aunt in anger..

1105
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:57,494
...she would've felt bad.

1106
01:05:57,654 --> 01:06:00,191
Then you would've felt
bad as you scolded them. I know.

1107
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:03,064
That's the reason,
I lied to you, uncle.

1108
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,800
I am sorry, dear. - Uncle,
why are you apologizing to me?

1109
01:06:07,998 --> 01:06:09,568
Nothing wrong, dear.

1110
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:14,238
I know many families break
because of a small misunderstanding.

1111
01:06:14,404 --> 01:06:17,874
Though you are young,
you thought it over..

1112
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:19,782
...you saved our
family from breaking..

1113
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:23,389
...and have kept our memories intact.

1114
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:26,285
May God bless you, dear.

1115
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:30,329
I thought,
why to fight over that glass shield..

1116
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:31,989
I thought I would
tell you that! broke it.

1117
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:34,794
I would've whacked you
if you would've told me that.

1118
01:06:38,295 --> 01:06:39,899
It is good that
I didn't say anything.

1119
01:06:42,432 --> 01:06:44,241
This girl's name is Bhavani.

1120
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,209
Father is a millionaire.

1121
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:47,609
Are they so rich.

1122
01:06:47,804 --> 01:06:50,250
They don't know about their earnings.

1123
01:06:50,407 --> 01:06:53,354
She's fair, but the earning is black.

1124
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:59,084
This girl is weak in education..
but nice girl. Is it okay for you?

1125
01:06:59,249 --> 01:07:00,728
I agree 30%.

1126
01:07:00,884 --> 01:07:03,091
But not the girl, her father..
the millionaire.

1127
01:07:03,253 --> 01:07:05,927
That means, you didn't like her.
Disaster.

1128
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,029
This girl's name is Suparna S.

1129
01:07:08,224 --> 01:07:11,501
She was born in US.
No brothers or sisters.

1130
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:14,174
Father is IPS and mother is IAS.

1131
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:16,469
I will fix if you say yes.

1132
01:07:16,666 --> 01:07:18,873
I agree to her 90%.

1133
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:20,309
Very good.

1134
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:22,882
So, did you like this girl? - Yes.

1135
01:07:25,442 --> 01:07:27,388
The girl is really beautiful.
They'll make a good couple.

1136
01:07:27,577 --> 01:07:28,715
Brother, agree to it.

1137
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,984
Sit here. - One minute.
I'll return from the bathroom..

1138
01:07:32,148 --> 01:07:33,388
...and announce the results to you.

1139
01:07:35,318 --> 01:07:37,195
Anyways, he liked her,
that's enough for us.

1140
01:07:37,854 --> 01:07:40,596
Oh.. there's something
cooking between them.

1141
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:42,760
Pooja. Pooja..

1142
01:07:43,126 --> 01:07:45,128
Why did you signal me when
I was doing an important work?

1143
01:07:45,295 --> 01:07:46,296
Like a commercial break.

1144
01:07:46,463 --> 01:07:48,409
You said you liked a girl.

1145
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:49,908
Can't you wait for her?

1146
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:51,841
Where do I find that girl now?

1147
01:07:52,002 --> 01:07:53,743
What's the guarantee that
I'll find her if I look for her?

1148
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,780
It is good that I forget her.

1149
01:07:55,972 --> 01:07:57,974
Did you call me to say this?
Shall I leave now?

1150
01:07:58,141 --> 01:07:59,586
Hey.. one minute.

1151
01:08:00,877 --> 01:08:02,049
What happened?

1152
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:05,019
Will you agree to the marriage
by just seeing her photo?

1153
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:07,058
Then, what can I do?

1154
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:09,025
You have to see that girl directly.

1155
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:11,529
You should feel that
she's born for you.

1156
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:14,993
You should be ready to
take any risk for that girl.

1157
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:18,271
Whatever you said, that girl
possess that qualities in her.

1158
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:20,499
If you can't understand still now,
you are not a human being.

1159
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:24,873
Hey, lower your voice. Why
are you bothered if I marry anyone?

1160
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:28,514
I am your friend,
I don't want you to get ruined..

1161
01:08:28,905 --> 01:08:31,317
...why should I bother
if you marry any Subamma.

1162
01:08:32,242 --> 01:08:34,552
It is not Subamma, it is Suparna.

1163
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:42,828
Raam, what did you
decide in the bathroom?

1164
01:08:43,019 --> 01:08:43,963
Tell me soon.

1165
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,190
Uncle, I feel..
I don't want to marry that girl.

1166
01:08:45,355 --> 01:08:46,891
You said 90% you agreed to that girl.

1167
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:49,434
But there should be 100% in life.

1168
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,371
Tell me what kind
of a girl do you like?

1169
01:08:52,562 --> 01:08:56,032
Seeing the girl,
I should feel that she's born for me.

1170
01:08:57,634 --> 01:09:01,081
I should feel like I should be
ready to take any risk for that girl.

1171
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:07,186
I should feel that if necessary, I
should lie to my family members too.

1172
01:09:25,194 --> 01:09:29,643
It was in my heart for a long time..

1173
01:09:29,799 --> 01:09:34,145
...but now I feel it has got lost.

1174
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:38,581
You kissed me in my dreams..

1175
01:09:38,775 --> 01:09:42,882
...I am shying away from myself now.

1176
01:09:43,246 --> 01:09:47,353
It is wrong to talk too much.

1177
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:51,427
Tell me something, 0 dear.

1178
01:10:01,131 --> 01:10:05,477
It was in my heart for a long time..

1179
01:10:05,669 --> 01:10:10,015
...but now I feel it has got lost.

1180
01:10:28,525 --> 01:10:30,163
5il19-

1181
01:10:30,793 --> 01:10:32,295
Dance.

1182
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:34,635
The drums are being played.

1183
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:36,435
Come. Come.

1184
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:46,082
You don't see in my eyes.
You see me stealthily.

1185
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:50,384
You are the same since I met you.

1186
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:55,093
My desires have awakened
since I met you.

1187
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:59,393
I am waiting for you, this is love.

1188
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:01,762
I don't fall for talks.
It is farce.

1189
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:04,063
I laugh from within.

1190
01:11:04,227 --> 01:11:08,141
There's no definite
language for love.

1191
01:11:08,331 --> 01:11:12,370
I am telling you the truth.

1192
01:11:12,736 --> 01:11:16,684
I like your lies too.

1193
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:21,311
It was in my heart for a long time..

1194
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:26,022
...but now I feel it has got lost.

1195
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:30,594
You kissed me in my dreams..

1196
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:34,894
...I am shying away from myself now.

1197
01:11:35,258 --> 01:11:39,536
Go, go. Don't show me attitude.

1198
01:11:39,729 --> 01:11:44,178
I saw the whole world,
but I didn't see crazy guy like you.

1199
01:12:02,285 --> 01:12:06,734
When the cold breeze
in the night troubles me.

1200
01:12:06,923 --> 01:12:11,235
I missed you as my body became hot.

1201
01:12:11,394 --> 01:12:15,638
Forget about the scorching heat.

1202
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:19,644
In my dreams, I got drenched
with you in the rain and fell sick.

1203
01:12:20,136 --> 01:12:24,448
I have a desire to
have petty fights with you.

1204
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:28,780
I feel like writing
a poem on your back.

1205
01:12:28,945 --> 01:12:32,518
Come and sit closer to me.

1206
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:36,887
Shy a bit more.

1207
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:42,267
It was in my heart for a long time..

1208
01:12:42,425 --> 01:12:46,805
...but now I feel it has got lost.

1209
01:12:46,963 --> 01:12:51,207
You kissed me in my dreams..

1210
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:55,440
...I am shying away from myself now.

1211
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:59,411
It is wrong to talk too much.

1212
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:03,848
Tell me something, 0 dear.

1213
01:13:15,992 --> 01:13:19,166
Hey Raam, as soon as
I became a classical dancer..

1214
01:13:19,362 --> 01:13:21,638
...do you think my behavior
too will be classy?

1215
01:13:21,831 --> 01:13:24,311
No. I won't spare anyone then.

1216
01:13:25,268 --> 01:13:27,339
Hey kid, hooliganism doesn't
suit your body language.

1217
01:13:27,537 --> 01:13:28,948
Anyways, tell me the matter.

1218
01:13:29,105 --> 01:13:32,484
First.. first..
First you ruined my sister's life.

1219
01:13:32,675 --> 01:13:37,055
Now you are snatching
away Pooja from my heart.

1220
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:40,258
What's the matter..
- Don't touch me, okay?

1221
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:42,123
Why? Didn't you have bath today?

1222
01:13:42,318 --> 01:13:44,730
Fine. Pooja didn't
come looking for you.

1223
01:13:44,887 --> 01:13:46,491
She came here as I sent her here.

1224
01:13:46,656 --> 01:13:47,999
What rubbish?

1225
01:13:48,191 --> 01:13:49,568
Do you know what actually happened?

1226
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:04,211
The music is being played.

1227
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:09,151
Let's stay together.
Let's be with my love.

1228
01:14:09,312 --> 01:14:11,883
There's something.. - Kumari..
no one is to be seen at home.

1229
01:14:12,048 --> 01:14:14,460
Everyone went to
meet Ganapati priest.

1230
01:14:16,986 --> 01:14:18,624
Where is that girl, Pooja?

1231
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:20,392
They took her along.

1232
01:14:20,556 --> 01:14:21,626
What?

1233
01:14:22,058 --> 01:14:25,232
Pooja, do you like Raam?

1234
01:14:26,429 --> 01:14:29,000
What can a girl say more than this?

1235
01:14:29,165 --> 01:14:31,167
We all are going
to fix your marriage..

1236
01:14:31,367 --> 01:14:33,608
...so we are going to discuss
it with priest Ganapati.

1237
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,752
Come on. Everyone come here.

1238
01:14:42,912 --> 01:14:45,688
It is said that if you
have bath in this water..

1239
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:49,261
...all your wishes will be fulfilled.

1240
01:14:49,419 --> 01:14:51,456
You all go and have bath..
I'll go to the priest.

1241
01:14:51,621 --> 01:14:53,123
...and talk about Pooja.

1242
01:14:53,289 --> 01:14:55,030
Okay. - Have bath soon.

1243
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:58,496
Pooja, let's go.

1244
01:15:06,936 --> 01:15:08,415
Greetings, Priest.

1245
01:15:09,438 --> 01:15:11,782
Oh Raghu? Is everything fine?

1246
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:15,717
I had to discuss one
important thing with you.

1247
01:15:17,713 --> 01:15:19,750
The girl that you sent..

1248
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:22,552
I didn't send anyone.

1249
01:15:42,405 --> 01:15:44,442
Who brought you here?

1250
01:15:44,607 --> 01:15:48,020
You want me, don't you? Let's go.

1251
01:16:03,259 --> 01:16:05,068
Goddess Chamundeshwari..

1252
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:08,338
...I came here with a problem"

1253
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:10,904
...you gave me what I wanted.

1254
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,910
I didn't know where to
take her until she gets her..

1255
01:16:55,111 --> 01:16:56,818
...visa and passport
I brought her home, uncle.

1256
01:16:57,013 --> 01:16:59,425
You love Pooja.

1257
01:17:02,018 --> 01:17:06,228
They don't look like humans.
Poor girl, Pooja.

1258
01:17:06,422 --> 01:17:13,465
Dear, it is wrong to leave the
one you love when they are in need.

1259
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:25,279
I gave you cars,
men, and money that you asked for.

1260
01:17:25,441 --> 01:17:28,650
Don't you feel ashamed
to say you didn't find her?

1261
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:37,594
If you don't find them,
I'll chop you into pieces.

1262
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:40,597
You are our servants,
you should obey our orders.

1263
01:17:40,757 --> 01:17:43,795
We want Pooja. Pooja!

1264
01:17:56,806 --> 01:17:58,046
See who it is!

1265
01:18:21,931 --> 01:18:24,138
Brother-in-law, let go off me.
Let go off me!

1266
01:18:45,421 --> 01:18:51,531
'Hey Partha,
you can't acquire me by bad means.'

1267
01:18:52,194 --> 01:18:54,265
'You don't have the power in you.'

1268
01:18:54,430 --> 01:18:56,910
'I am the warrior of the..'

1269
01:19:01,704 --> 01:19:03,377
Thank you. - Why?

1270
01:19:03,573 --> 01:19:04,677
Because you came for me.

1271
01:19:04,874 --> 01:19:08,686
I didn't come for you. I told
you about the girl I saw in the car..

1272
01:19:08,878 --> 01:19:10,221
...I got that girl's photograph.

1273
01:19:10,379 --> 01:19:13,087
So, I thought I would show
her photo to you. See this.

1274
01:19:13,649 --> 01:19:17,096
Wow, she's so beautiful.
Have a look. Have a look.

1275
01:19:47,216 --> 01:19:51,995
I like you very much, dear.

1276
01:19:54,590 --> 01:20:00,268
Love is beautiful
only because of you.

1277
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:07,581
It is an immortal
and sweet passion.

1278
01:20:08,838 --> 01:20:15,312
You be with me always.
It is like heaven.

1279
01:20:16,745 --> 01:20:21,592
I like you very much, dear.

1280
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:29,126
Even I like you very much, dear.

1281
01:21:07,997 --> 01:21:11,501
Let's walk together..

1282
01:21:11,701 --> 01:21:15,205
...no matter if it is heat or shade.

1283
01:21:15,404 --> 01:21:18,908
My heart has met with yours.

1284
01:21:19,074 --> 01:21:22,715
It is a new kind of feeling.

1285
01:21:22,912 --> 01:21:26,291
Why do I sleep when
I have the dream with me?

1286
01:21:26,449 --> 01:21:30,591
I don't want to live
as I have life with me.

1287
01:21:31,086 --> 01:21:34,590
No matter what comes our way..

1288
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:37,964
...we'll never depart.

1289
01:21:38,127 --> 01:21:43,042
I like you very much, dear.

1290
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:50,373
There's no life without you, dear.

1291
01:22:10,693 --> 01:22:11,933
0h yeah!

1292
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:38,129
This is the time set by the nature..

1293
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:41,996
...for our hearts to meet.

1294
01:22:42,191 --> 01:22:45,638
This is the story of our love..

1295
01:22:45,828 --> 01:22:49,241
...which will not end.

1296
01:22:49,498 --> 01:22:53,105
I want to live with
you in every birth.

1297
01:22:53,269 --> 01:22:57,342
This is a new beginning for us.

1298
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:04,621
I liked you.
I am not content with your love.

1299
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:09,421
My heart can never forget you.

1300
01:23:12,054 --> 01:23:17,629
Love is beautiful
only because of you.

1301
01:23:19,061 --> 01:23:24,943
It is an immortal and ..
- Sweet passion.

1302
01:23:26,301 --> 01:23:32,980
You be with me always.
It is like heaven.

1303
01:23:33,909 --> 01:23:36,856
Raam, my mother likes
her brothers very much.

1304
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:39,856
So, she convinced my father..
she got her brothers married..

1305
01:23:40,049 --> 01:23:41,392
...to his sisters.

1306
01:23:42,618 --> 01:23:45,155
Then, we settled in
abroad with my father.

1307
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:50,201
No matter wherever they go,
but this village is their favorite.

1308
01:23:50,726 --> 01:23:52,501
No matter how busy
my father would be..

1309
01:23:52,661 --> 01:23:56,768
...he would celebrate my birthday
with everyone in this village.

1310
01:23:56,932 --> 01:24:00,470
One day.. my uncles
fought because of property"

1311
01:24:00,636 --> 01:24:01,979
...and the family broke.

1312
01:24:02,137 --> 01:24:05,675
My parents wished that
they should reunite..

1313
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:09,083
...and my marriage should
take place in everyone's presence.

1314
01:24:09,244 --> 01:24:13,090
But it didn't happen.
They both died in an accident.

1315
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:16,959
I couldn't stay in America,
so I came here.

1316
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:19,599
My uncles forcefully
tried to get me married.

1317
01:24:24,259 --> 01:24:25,567
What do we do now?

1318
01:24:26,528 --> 01:24:27,666
One idea.

1319
01:24:37,039 --> 01:24:38,746
What happened? Where had you been?

1320
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:40,716
I escaped from uncle Nagappa.

1321
01:24:40,876 --> 01:24:42,287
Come on, let's go.

1322
01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:51,420
When we enquired about them,
we realized that..

1323
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:53,497
...there's only one auditor
to both the families.

1324
01:24:53,655 --> 01:24:55,760
He comes once in a week
for their bank work and auditing..

1325
01:24:55,925 --> 01:24:57,598
...work from Basawana Halli.

1326
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,671
His name is McDowell Murthy.

1327
01:24:59,862 --> 01:25:01,273
Hello MC Murthy here.

1328
01:25:01,463 --> 01:25:03,534
I am Sukumari speaking. - Tell me.

1329
01:25:03,699 --> 01:25:05,872
You took so much of money with you..

1330
01:25:06,034 --> 01:25:07,570
I called to know whether you
deposited it in the bank safely..

1331
01:25:07,736 --> 01:25:10,273
...or somebody would've hit
on your head and took that money..

1332
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:11,850
...and you are lying in a hospital.

1333
01:25:12,007 --> 01:25:14,009
Is this your love or your intuition?

1334
01:25:14,176 --> 01:25:15,348
Nothing like that..

1335
01:25:15,511 --> 01:25:19,357
It is just 25 lakes, I've
carried cores of rupees till now.

1336
01:25:19,548 --> 01:25:21,050
Hang the phone.

1337
01:25:22,918 --> 01:25:24,795
Boss, give me a DD challan.

1338
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:27,399
What? - Sir, it is here. Take this.

1339
01:25:27,556 --> 01:25:28,728
Thank you. - Welcome.

1340
01:25:30,192 --> 01:25:32,365
Sir, there's ink on your shirt.

1341
01:25:50,512 --> 01:25:51,456
My suitcase.
- What's the matter, sir?

1342
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:52,785
My suitcase. My suitcase.

1343
01:25:52,948 --> 01:25:54,586
Not one or two..
there were 25 lakes in it.

1344
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:56,354
They stole my bag.. - Sir..

1345
01:25:56,518 --> 01:25:58,930
The man who stole it wouldn't
stay here. Go out and look for him.

1346
01:25:59,955 --> 01:26:04,927
Sukku.. Sukku.. open the door.

1347
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:07,704
Why are you in a haste?

1348
01:26:09,965 --> 01:26:11,501
What happened? - I'll tell you later.

1349
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:14,671
Pack your bags. Lets leave from here.
- What happened?

1350
01:26:14,837 --> 01:26:16,714
Somebody stole 25
lake rupees from me.

1351
01:26:16,872 --> 01:26:19,443
If sir knows this
he'll kill both of us.

1352
01:26:19,641 --> 01:26:23,020
They robbed you? They didn't
hit on your head or break your leg.

1353
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:25,658
How did you lose it?
- To hell with you.

1354
01:26:25,814 --> 01:26:28,556
I am tensed and
you are mocking at me.

1355
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:32,696
They are here.
They'll kill us. What do I do?

1356
01:26:33,055 --> 01:26:36,036
If anyone asks for me,
tell them I am not at home.

1357
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:39,571
Is this MC Krishnamurthy's house?

1358
01:26:39,761 --> 01:26:40,762
I don't know.

1359
01:26:40,929 --> 01:26:43,569
This briefcase had
his name and address.

1360
01:26:43,732 --> 01:26:45,109
So, I thought I would
return it to him.

1361
01:26:45,267 --> 01:26:47,042
Didn't I say, I don't know anything?

1362
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:49,443
How are you related to him?

1363
01:26:50,272 --> 01:26:51,808
I'll ask him and tell
you after he returns.

1364
01:26:51,974 --> 01:26:53,578
Hey, shut up. - Mr. Murthy?

1365
01:26:53,776 --> 01:26:55,153
Yes, it is me.

1366
01:26:56,011 --> 01:26:57,991
Thank God.

1367
01:26:58,981 --> 01:27:00,961
Where did you get this briefcase?

1368
01:27:01,116 --> 01:27:03,187
I was drinking tea inside the bank.

1369
01:27:03,352 --> 01:27:04,854
One man was running
with this briefcase.

1370
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:06,930
I got a doubt.
I caught him and thrashed him.

1371
01:27:07,089 --> 01:27:09,592
I saw your name and address
on the briefcase. So..

1372
01:27:09,825 --> 01:27:12,066
That fool stole my briefcase.

1373
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:14,173
But you stole my heart, dear.

1374
01:27:14,363 --> 01:27:15,341
What's your name, dear?

1375
01:27:15,531 --> 01:27:16,601
Raama Krishna Parmahamsa.

1376
01:27:16,765 --> 01:27:18,210
Everyone calls me Raam.

1377
01:27:18,367 --> 01:27:20,472
You are like Lord Ram to me.

1378
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:22,909
Take this Rs. 10.

1379
01:27:23,138 --> 01:27:24,583
Hide it or someone will steal it.

1380
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:28,381
Sir, which shopping center
do I go to spend this money?

1381
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:32,525
Sir, I don't want money. Just
give n1e one meal and water to drink.

1382
01:27:32,681 --> 01:27:34,558
Okay. Sukku! - What is it?

1383
01:27:34,716 --> 01:27:36,457
Did you keep the food in the
fridge last night or you threw it?

1384
01:27:36,652 --> 01:27:38,256
I've kept it in the fridge.

1385
01:27:38,454 --> 01:27:40,058
Serve him. Let him eat and leave.

1386
01:27:40,222 --> 01:27:42,498
Go dear, have food and leave.
- Okay, sir.

1387
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:44,866
Why did you come to this village?

1388
01:27:45,027 --> 01:27:49,066
Sir, there's a famous auditor named
MC Krishnamurthy in this village.

1389
01:27:49,231 --> 01:27:51,768
He's an inspiration
for youths like us.

1390
01:27:51,967 --> 01:27:53,378
Like Abdul Kalam for the scientists.

1391
01:27:53,535 --> 01:27:55,208
Bill gates for software engineers.

1392
01:27:55,404 --> 01:27:57,748
The same way MC Krishnamurthy
for the auditors.

1393
01:27:57,939 --> 01:28:00,715
So, I've come here
to become his disciple.

1394
01:28:00,876 --> 01:28:04,414
You are very lucky.
Take this chicken.

1395
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:06,819
You are looking
for MC Krishnamurthy..

1396
01:28:06,982 --> 01:28:08,859
...it is me.

1397
01:28:09,017 --> 01:28:11,019
Sir, it is you?

1398
01:28:11,186 --> 01:28:14,167
One more surprise for you.
I've fixed an appointment.

1399
01:28:14,356 --> 01:28:16,996
Sir.. thanks a lot, sir. Thank you.

1400
01:28:17,192 --> 01:28:18,603
Don't get too excited, dear.

1401
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:19,795
The salary they give
is very less. Come on.

1402
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:21,702
Even I know that you'll have to eat
bones if you are living with a dog.

1403
01:28:21,863 --> 01:28:23,001
What are you watching?

1404
01:28:23,198 --> 01:28:25,235
Get the poppadums for him.

1405
01:28:26,835 --> 01:28:29,372
Look.. we have only
two clients in our company.

1406
01:28:29,571 --> 01:28:31,608
One is senior Mallaya and
the other is junior Mallaya.

1407
01:28:31,773 --> 01:28:34,947
Both are fingerprints. Illiterates.

1408
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:36,180
I'll ask you something now.

1409
01:28:36,345 --> 01:28:39,121
How many times do you
pay income tax in a year?

1410
01:28:39,281 --> 01:28:42,160
Only once..
- But I pay 10 times in a month.

1411
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:43,727
That's wrong, sir. Isn't it?

1412
01:28:43,885 --> 01:28:45,887
The one who survives on black
money is also wrong, isn't it?

1413
01:28:46,054 --> 01:28:48,864
I look innocent,
but I am a dangerous man.

1414
01:28:49,024 --> 01:28:50,298
If you continue to do the same,
you'll die one day.

1415
01:28:50,459 --> 01:28:52,871
What did you say?
- Sir, you are superb. Superb!

1416
01:28:53,028 --> 01:28:55,065
Your life changes from today.

1417
01:28:55,264 --> 01:28:57,505
Give me that mug. Give it to me.

1418
01:28:57,666 --> 01:28:58,804
Cheers.

1419
01:29:02,537 --> 01:29:05,711
What's that sound?
- Sir, I got a message.

1420
01:29:05,907 --> 01:29:08,751
Do you have a mobile?
- I took it in installment.

1421
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:12,380
They are allergic to mobiles. They'll
cut your signal then. Throw that.

1422
01:29:12,914 --> 01:29:14,018
Do as I say. - Okay, sir.

1423
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:17,129
Greetings, sir.
- What about Babu Nagraj, Murthy?

1424
01:29:17,286 --> 01:29:19,459
Sir, no one can confront you.

1425
01:29:19,621 --> 01:29:21,897
So, people back
out hearing your name.

1426
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:27,666
Sir, this is the oblation for you.
Sir, all this is for you.

1427
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:31,204
Who is he? - He's from my village.

1428
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:33,402
I've hired him as
an assistant. - Hey!

1429
01:29:33,569 --> 01:29:38,143
Didn't I tell you that no
one should know about our business?

1430
01:29:38,306 --> 01:29:41,844
Sir, he's none other than my sister's
son. My late brother-in-law's son.

1431
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:44,513
Sir, see. We both resemble
each other. Same to same.

1432
01:29:44,713 --> 01:29:46,488
We both resemble each other
since childhood. Same to same.

1433
01:29:46,648 --> 01:29:48,218
Will I become like you
when I grow old, brother-in-law?

1434
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:50,192
Shut up.

1435
01:29:51,987 --> 01:29:53,660
Does he have any experience?

1436
01:29:53,822 --> 01:29:55,893
Chicago Chandrashekhar is in America.

1437
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:57,434
He's a very rich man, sir.

1438
01:29:57,626 --> 01:29:58,627
They've got property
worth 500 cores.

1439
01:29:58,793 --> 01:30:00,136
He takes care of their accounts.

1440
01:30:00,328 --> 01:30:02,137
Brother-in-law,
who is Chicago Chandrashekhar?

1441
01:30:02,297 --> 01:30:06,006
Shut up. Yes, sir.
- Brother-in-law it is wrong to lie.

1442
01:30:06,201 --> 01:30:08,238
If I tell the truth, you'll
have to take me to the cemetery.

1443
01:30:08,704 --> 01:30:12,618
My lovable son is here.
Come here, my lion cub.

1444
01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:17,019
Murthy, how are you?

1445
01:30:17,212 --> 01:30:18,714
Hello, sir. I am fine.

1446
01:30:19,014 --> 01:30:21,016
Who's this? - He's my nephew.

1447
01:30:21,183 --> 01:30:22,856
Doesn't he have manners to greet me?

1448
01:30:23,051 --> 01:30:24,962
You'll surely die.
- What did you say?

1449
01:30:25,153 --> 01:30:28,032
It is said that if elders
greet young children, they die.

1450
01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:30,067
Shall I greet you? - No.

1451
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:33,597
Murthy. Bow down.
- No, sir. I've got cold today.

1452
01:30:34,229 --> 01:30:36,038
Bow down. - No, sir.

1453
01:30:36,231 --> 01:30:38,438
I am getting late to the school.
Bow down, Murthy. - No, sir.

1454
01:30:38,633 --> 01:30:40,704
Bow down! - Okay, sir.

1455
01:30:40,902 --> 01:30:43,883
If I thrash you,
you'll mix up in the sand.

1456
01:30:47,309 --> 01:30:49,016
VET'? 900d, my son.

1457
01:30:49,344 --> 01:30:52,018
Hey Dodda Malla. You idiot.

1458
01:30:52,214 --> 01:30:54,592
You alone eat food of 10 people.

1459
01:30:54,783 --> 01:30:56,490
What's wrong with you?

1460
01:30:56,685 --> 01:31:01,100
Instead of doing all this,
can't you commit suicide and die?

1461
01:31:02,057 --> 01:31:05,698
Grandpa, everyone mocks at
me in the school because of my plait.

1462
01:31:05,861 --> 01:31:08,171
You are like a buffalo, so it
is obvious that they'll mock at you.

1463
01:31:08,363 --> 01:31:09,967
Mother! - Get lost!

1464
01:31:10,499 --> 01:31:13,002
If you agree, I'll cut this plait.

1465
01:31:13,201 --> 01:31:14,339
Dodda Malla!

1466
01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:17,979
It is not just a plait.
It is the pride of our family.

1467
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:21,019
Slit their throats
whoever mocks at you.

1468
01:31:21,209 --> 01:31:24,656
But dare you tell me that
you want to cut this plait.

1469
01:31:24,813 --> 01:31:28,283
Okay, grandpa. He doesn't understand
my plight. I am so unfortunate.

1470
01:31:28,517 --> 01:31:29,860
Sir.. - What's it!

1471
01:31:30,051 --> 01:31:31,587
Sir, I am getting late. - So?

1472
01:31:31,753 --> 01:31:33,596
I've to pay income tax. - How much?

1473
01:31:33,789 --> 01:31:36,531
Sir, 15 lake rupees.
- 15 lake rupees?

1474
01:31:36,691 --> 01:31:39,228
Yes, sir. I was accounting
whole night. I got psyched doing so.

1475
01:31:39,394 --> 01:31:45,174
'Hey Partha,
you can't acquire me by bad means.'

1476
01:31:45,901 --> 01:31:48,211
'You don't have the power in you.'

1477
01:31:48,370 --> 01:31:50,611
'I am the warrior
of this motherland.'

1478
01:31:50,772 --> 01:31:54,948
'Your sins have increased now.'

1479
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:57,522
Naga, what's the matter?

1480
01:31:57,679 --> 01:31:59,283
I heard the same voice again.

1481
01:31:59,481 --> 01:32:02,223
The one who hit on my head is here.

1482
01:32:02,417 --> 01:32:04,795
Sir, you managed it so well.

1483
01:32:04,953 --> 01:32:08,059
Or you can't live in
between demons like them.

1484
01:32:08,323 --> 01:32:11,964
Sir, I got so angry when
that fat boy was hitting you.

1485
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:14,106
That's the reason I
charged 15 lakes from them.

1486
01:32:14,262 --> 01:32:15,570
Great, sir. You are great.

1487
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:18,540
You were standing stunned there.

1488
01:32:18,733 --> 01:32:21,839
Sir, you lie so much.
Don't you get tensed?

1489
01:32:22,037 --> 01:32:24,745
I keep lying when time comes.

1490
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:26,146
You don't get tensed.

1491
01:32:26,308 --> 01:32:29,846
I have over.. over creativity in me.

1492
01:32:30,011 --> 01:32:31,149
Did you understand? - Yes, sir.

1493
01:32:31,313 --> 01:32:36,729
What? - I'll have to enact
as you when time arises. Come, sir.

1494
01:32:37,118 --> 01:32:39,291
Hi Happy, how are you?

1495
01:32:39,488 --> 01:32:42,401
I had never thought
I would live like this.

1496
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:45,800
My happiness got ruined
since I gave you a lift.

1497
01:32:45,961 --> 01:32:48,441
I've thought of an idea now.
If you follow it..

1498
01:32:48,597 --> 01:32:50,076
...your freedom is guaranteed.

1499
01:32:50,265 --> 01:32:56,181
Sir, I've thought of
a wonderful plan now. - What?

1500
01:32:56,338 --> 01:33:00,377
Sir, you should know who abducted
your daughter-in-law, isn't it?

1501
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:03,419
Get your photo album, I'll tell you.

1502
01:33:03,778 --> 01:33:06,554
What kind of an idea is this?

1503
01:33:06,748 --> 01:33:08,318
Hey, go and get the photo album.
- Okay, sir.

1504
01:33:08,483 --> 01:33:10,258
Get it soon. I want to go home.

1505
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:15,231
Tell n1e one thing..
you took so long to get this idea.

1506
01:33:16,892 --> 01:33:21,432
Not him.. it is him.. it is him, sir.

1507
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:22,734
Take this.

1508
01:33:23,932 --> 01:33:26,538
He's not from our side.
- Okay, fine, sir.

1509
01:33:26,701 --> 01:33:30,205
Tell me properly
or I'll smash your face.

1510
01:33:30,372 --> 01:33:31,476
Then you keep writing on it.

1511
01:33:31,673 --> 01:33:35,849
Oh God.. I am sure it was him.
Today it is him and tomorrow..

1512
01:33:41,049 --> 01:33:42,892
You may leave now. - Okay, sir.

1513
01:33:43,051 --> 01:33:44,655
Thanks a lot, sir. Thanks a lot.

1514
01:33:44,819 --> 01:33:47,732
Sir, I've told you once
and I am telling you again..

1515
01:33:47,922 --> 01:33:49,560
Tippayya is very dangerous.

1516
01:33:49,724 --> 01:33:51,203
He won't let this
marriage take place.

1517
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:53,896
Be careful, sir.
I shall leave now, sir. - Hey!

1518
01:33:54,096 --> 01:33:55,268
Brother.. - Stop there.

1519
01:33:55,463 --> 01:34:00,708
Why? - If you are
telling it for my good..

1520
01:34:00,902 --> 01:34:02,973
...then stay here till
this wedding takes place.

1521
01:34:03,138 --> 01:34:05,311
Sir, what's this? Sir, I beg of you.

1522
01:34:05,507 --> 01:34:06,781
I have wife and
children waiting for me.

1523
01:34:06,941 --> 01:34:07,976
Sir, let go off me.
Please. - Take him from here.

1524
01:34:08,176 --> 01:34:09,814
Take him from here. - Please, sir.

1525
01:34:09,978 --> 01:34:12,015
Let go off me! Let go off me!

1526
01:34:13,115 --> 01:34:17,530
Murthy, I heard Dodda
Malla won the case of liquor.

1527
01:34:18,253 --> 01:34:20,733
Forget about that.
I've got an idea by which..

1528
01:34:20,922 --> 01:34:22,765
...you can become the
president of that association.

1529
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:24,728
Yes, sir. - Who is he?

1530
01:34:25,193 --> 01:34:26,934
He's my sister's son.
His name is Raam.

1531
01:34:27,128 --> 01:34:28,163
Greet him. - Greetings, sir.

1532
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:30,707
Sir, he's an expert in accounts.

1533
01:34:30,899 --> 01:34:32,674
Chicago Chandrashekhar is in America.

1534
01:34:32,834 --> 01:34:34,780
He's a very rich man..
he was working with him earlier.

1535
01:34:34,969 --> 01:34:37,074
Sir, Dodda Malla had
already had an eye on him.

1536
01:34:37,272 --> 01:34:38,512
I said, it is not possible.

1537
01:34:38,673 --> 01:34:40,550
I said, he'll check
both of your accounts.

1538
01:34:40,709 --> 01:34:42,382
Both of our accounts?

1539
01:34:42,544 --> 01:34:44,524
Like you.. Chicago Chandrashekhar..

1540
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:46,056
...had a brother named Dollars Dinesh.

1541
01:34:46,214 --> 01:34:48,353
He used to maintain both
of their accounts. - Yes.

1542
01:34:48,517 --> 01:34:50,793
Sir, the account has been done.

1543
01:34:50,952 --> 01:34:52,454
If you see it once..

1544
01:34:52,654 --> 01:34:56,067
I don't know all that.
You see it and pay the tax.

1545
01:34:56,224 --> 01:34:57,828
Thanks, sir.
- father-in-law, don't say that.

1546
01:34:58,026 --> 01:35:00,905
It is said that you have to keep an
account even if you throw peels out.

1547
01:35:01,162 --> 01:35:03,403
I got bored and couldn't
find any book to read..

1548
01:35:03,565 --> 01:35:05,169
...and I saw last
year's accounts book.

1549
01:35:05,367 --> 01:35:06,368
There's a difference of Rs. 13 in it.

1550
01:35:06,568 --> 01:35:07,774
Rs. 13, uncle.

1551
01:35:07,969 --> 01:35:10,142
That's it? Let it be.

1552
01:35:10,305 --> 01:35:11,409
Father-in-law, that's not the case.

1553
01:35:11,573 --> 01:35:13,553
Today he's take Rs.
13, tomorrow it can be 13 lakes.

1554
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:15,745
You are right, dear.

1555
01:35:15,910 --> 01:35:18,789
Murthy, show all the accounts
to my daughter-in-law from now on.

1556
01:35:18,947 --> 01:35:19,891
Hey you.. - Yes, madam.

1557
01:35:20,081 --> 01:35:21,719
Are you his assistant? - Yes, madam.

1558
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:23,885
Do you know English?
- Yes, madam. A little.

1559
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:25,998
Get all the accounts book in my room.

1560
01:35:27,489 --> 01:35:29,162
Somehow manage to settle things.

1561
01:35:29,324 --> 01:35:31,497
You taught me to lie.
See howl lie to them now.

1562
01:35:31,693 --> 01:35:34,105
What is that?
- Nothing, dear.. you go.

1563
01:35:34,262 --> 01:35:35,468
Come.

1564
01:35:35,697 --> 01:35:39,941
Hey Murthy.
The government says right.

1565
01:35:40,135 --> 01:35:42,979
If you are educated.. you'll
have no outstanding loans to pay.

1566
01:35:44,472 --> 01:35:46,383
You know it first.

1567
01:35:46,674 --> 01:35:49,518
My cousin keeps falling on me.

1568
01:35:49,677 --> 01:35:51,247
Settle his accounts first.

1569
01:35:51,413 --> 01:35:53,791
Is that all?
First settle my accounts.

1570
01:35:53,948 --> 01:35:55,154
Please. - Raam, somebody may see us.

1571
01:35:55,317 --> 01:35:56,728
Is that all?
Close your eyes. No one will see you.

1572
01:35:56,885 --> 01:35:57,886
Raam, no. - Please, please.

1573
01:35:58,053 --> 01:35:59,896
Raam, no! - Oh God.

1574
01:36:00,055 --> 01:36:02,535
Hey, I am sorry.
Sorry. Please, sorry.

1575
01:36:03,124 --> 01:36:04,262
Stupid.

1576
01:36:07,996 --> 01:36:12,411
I don't know if he'll settle the
accounts or get me killed by them.

1577
01:36:13,268 --> 01:36:15,805
Let me see what accounts he's doing.

1578
01:36:29,651 --> 01:36:31,631
You shouldn't be just wearing
good clothes and roaming about..

1579
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:34,960
...you should be very.. hey Murthy!

1580
01:36:36,658 --> 01:36:38,262
Why are you sweating so much?

1581
01:36:38,426 --> 01:36:40,906
Nothing.. - Just because she's
taking care of the accounts now?

1582
01:36:41,062 --> 01:36:43,838
She's my daughter-in-law.
Don't take her so easily.

1583
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:45,739
Sir, even I came to know that now.

1584
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:47,573
You came to know it, isn't it?
Come on, let's go.

1585
01:36:47,769 --> 01:36:50,272
Sir, you leave.
I'll talk to my nephew and come.

1586
01:36:50,472 --> 01:36:52,884
My daughter-in-law won't
let him to talk to you.

1587
01:36:53,074 --> 01:36:54,451
Let they continue, you come with me.

1588
01:36:54,609 --> 01:36:56,088
It is okay if they continue,
but if somebody sees them..

1589
01:36:56,244 --> 01:36:57,416
...it will be a big problem.

1590
01:36:57,579 --> 01:36:58,785
I am telling you nothing will happen.

1591
01:36:59,014 --> 01:37:02,427
Come with me now.
- Okay, sir. Their wish.

1592
01:37:04,786 --> 01:37:05,764
Sir.. - What is it?

1593
01:37:05,954 --> 01:37:08,798
Sir, she's going into madam's room.

1594
01:37:08,957 --> 01:37:10,300
Let she check too. Forget it.

1595
01:37:10,492 --> 01:37:12,995
No sir, my nephew"
he's very young, sir.

1596
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:15,835
Even my wife is experienced.
She'll explain it to them.

1597
01:37:15,997 --> 01:37:17,999
You come with me. - Is it?

1598
01:37:18,166 --> 01:37:19,304
<i>Pooh?</i>

1599
01:37:21,803 --> 01:37:25,842
Pooja is like my daughter.
She should live happily.

1600
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:27,576
That's the only thing I wish for.

1601
01:37:27,909 --> 01:37:30,287
It is not possible if she's here.

1602
01:37:30,445 --> 01:37:33,051
So, you both leave from here.

1603
01:37:33,214 --> 01:37:37,663
Aunt, Pooja loves you
as much as you do to her.

1604
01:37:37,819 --> 01:37:41,357
I don't want her to
miss you all because of me.

1605
01:37:41,556 --> 01:37:42,830
Like her parents wishes..

1606
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:45,026
...our marriage should
take place with your blessings.

1607
01:37:45,226 --> 01:37:48,400
It will take place.
- But.. people here are fools.

1608
01:37:48,596 --> 01:37:49,836
They don't understand anything.

1609
01:37:50,031 --> 01:37:52,033
The one who's dumb
can go around the world..

1610
01:37:52,233 --> 01:37:54,474
...but the one who's intelligent
can make the world go round.

1611
01:37:54,669 --> 01:37:56,342
Sir, I managed it very well.

1612
01:37:56,537 --> 01:37:57,914
You are really great, sir.

1613
01:37:58,072 --> 01:38:00,109
I'll smash your face now. - Why, sir?

1614
01:38:00,275 --> 01:38:02,721
My body is burning.
- What happened, sir?

1615
01:38:02,944 --> 01:38:06,153
I saw you and her rolling on the bed.

1616
01:38:06,314 --> 01:38:09,693
She fell on me first. But you
shouldn't have seen it stealthily.

1617
01:38:09,884 --> 01:38:11,329
Do you expect me to
take a ticket to see that?

1618
01:38:11,519 --> 01:38:14,523
Hey fool, it is a common
scene in rich people's house.

1619
01:38:14,722 --> 01:38:16,224
You shouldn't get carried away.

1620
01:38:20,562 --> 01:38:23,338
Go.. go and finish your work.
Go. - Sir.

1621
01:38:24,165 --> 01:38:26,645
I told you to show the accounts, but
you're trying to show book to her.

1622
01:38:26,801 --> 01:38:27,973
Come on.

1623
01:38:31,506 --> 01:38:33,213
What's this? Somebody may see us.

1624
01:38:33,374 --> 01:38:35,354
So, do you expect me to be quiet?

1625
01:38:35,543 --> 01:38:37,022
Shall we go to the theater?

1626
01:38:37,212 --> 01:38:39,317
So, we can do everything there.

1627
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:40,618
Yes.

1628
01:38:41,549 --> 01:38:44,086
I think it is.. mask man.

1629
01:38:46,721 --> 01:38:48,428
Hey, remove your hand.

1630
01:38:48,656 --> 01:38:49,828
You said we'll do
everything in the theater?

1631
01:38:50,024 --> 01:38:51,435
Did I say that? - Yes.

1632
01:38:51,592 --> 01:38:54,038
I am famished.
Please, get something to eat.

1633
01:38:54,229 --> 01:38:56,402
Is it? Wait,
I'll get something to eat.

1634
01:39:41,476 --> 01:39:42,955
Hey, who are you?

1635
01:39:43,144 --> 01:39:45,818
Krish. - You were in the movie.
What are you doing here?

1636
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:48,051
I wanted to show you a film. - What?

1637
01:39:48,216 --> 01:39:51,789
I heard that you are going closer
to that girl and troubling her.

1638
01:39:51,986 --> 01:39:53,761
So, I came here
to teach you a lesson.

1639
01:39:53,922 --> 01:39:55,458
How can you teach me a lesson?

1640
01:39:55,623 --> 01:39:57,534
I'll give you a sound thrashing.

1641
01:39:57,692 --> 01:39:59,433
Try it. - Try?

1642
01:41:09,464 --> 01:41:10,636
I'll escape.

1643
01:41:28,649 --> 01:41:30,128
Krish?

1644
01:41:30,284 --> 01:41:31,661
You said Krish thrashed you.

1645
01:41:31,852 --> 01:41:33,559
How is it possible for him to come
out of the screen and thrash you?

1646
01:41:33,755 --> 01:41:35,666
Is he in the whole movie?

1647
01:41:35,823 --> 01:41:38,861
He came out and thrashed
me when he had time.

1648
01:41:39,027 --> 01:41:40,028
He's right, dear.

1649
01:41:40,228 --> 01:41:44,005
He's got thrashed by him,
so why will he lie to us.

1650
01:41:44,165 --> 01:41:45,405
Why are you standing
here hearing our stories?

1651
01:41:45,566 --> 01:41:48,069
Come inside. I have to
check accounts. - Okay, madam.

1652
01:41:48,269 --> 01:41:49,714
Madam.. the female
who's getting married..

1653
01:41:49,870 --> 01:41:51,144
...shouldn't get tensed
about the accounts.

1654
01:41:51,339 --> 01:41:55,310
Sir, tell her not to check.
- Murthy, why are you saying that?

1655
01:41:55,476 --> 01:41:57,979
She's the one who has to
take care of the accounts tomorrow.

1656
01:41:58,146 --> 01:42:01,389
You take him with you, dear.
- Okay, father-in-law.

1657
01:42:01,549 --> 01:42:03,927
I'll go. I'll tell you
in detail when I return.

1658
01:42:04,085 --> 01:42:05,291
Come on.

1659
01:42:06,654 --> 01:42:10,625
Murthy, you start sweating
profusely whenever..

1660
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:13,704
...she talks about the accounts.

1661
01:42:14,295 --> 01:42:15,672
Sir, you can't reveal some things.

1662
01:42:15,830 --> 01:42:18,436
If I say, I'll get killed.
If I leave, they'll bear children.

1663
01:42:18,633 --> 01:42:20,237
Accounts..

1664
01:42:23,604 --> 01:42:26,915
I am crazy about you.

1665
01:42:33,614 --> 01:42:35,958
New song and music.

1666
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:41,323
The old love story.

1667
01:42:44,359 --> 01:42:48,000
You are very slow.
The world is very fast.

1668
01:42:48,162 --> 01:42:50,540
Be careful when with me.

1669
01:42:51,065 --> 01:42:53,136
New song and music.

1670
01:42:55,003 --> 01:42:56,744
Drive safely.

1671
01:42:56,904 --> 01:42:58,440
Road humps for safety driving.

1672
01:42:58,639 --> 01:43:01,085
Let's go for a jolly ride.

1673
01:43:01,542 --> 01:43:03,544
The old love story.

1674
01:43:05,146 --> 01:43:12,155
I don't know why I am
feeling so bored. - Is it?

1675
01:43:12,353 --> 01:43:15,391
Let's dance at least two steps.

1676
01:43:15,557 --> 01:43:17,503
New song and music.

1677
01:43:19,093 --> 01:43:21,471
The old love story.

1678
01:43:40,481 --> 01:43:43,087
Song.. sing a song.

1679
01:43:43,951 --> 01:43:46,625
Song.. sing a song.

1680
01:43:47,388 --> 01:43:49,163
Johnny Johnny, yes papa.

1681
01:43:49,357 --> 01:43:50,859
Eating sugar, I10 Pal“-

1682
01:43:51,025 --> 01:43:54,063
You should say it in Kannada.

1683
01:43:57,899 --> 01:44:01,312
Say it with a little love.

1684
01:44:01,469 --> 01:44:04,939
I love you.. to say this..

1685
01:44:05,106 --> 01:44:08,383
...I get very tired.

1686
01:44:08,543 --> 01:44:15,290
What can I say? You are very lazy.

1687
01:44:15,449 --> 01:44:18,362
Let there be some gap between us.

1688
01:44:18,552 --> 01:44:20,554
New song and music.

1689
01:44:21,989 --> 01:44:23,730
The old love story.

1690
01:44:41,909 --> 01:44:42,819
What is it?

1691
01:44:42,977 --> 01:44:44,888
I am crazy about you.

1692
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:49,020
I am crazy about you.

1693
01:44:49,784 --> 01:44:51,730
Give me a kiss. Let's bet.

1694
01:44:51,919 --> 01:44:53,796
Let's play head and push.

1695
01:44:53,954 --> 01:44:56,992
My kiss is very costly.

1696
01:44:57,191 --> 01:45:00,638
Let's climb some
mountain and dance there.

1697
01:45:00,828 --> 01:45:04,207
I have better work to do.

1698
01:45:04,398 --> 01:45:07,709
Instead of singing this song..

1699
01:45:07,869 --> 01:45:11,214
...what better work do you have?

1700
01:45:11,372 --> 01:45:14,751
Enough of singing and dancing now..

1701
01:45:14,909 --> 01:45:18,220
...let's share our
joys and sorrows now.

1702
01:45:18,379 --> 01:45:21,258
We'll name our future baby.

1703
01:45:21,415 --> 01:45:23,258
New song and music.

1704
01:45:24,819 --> 01:45:26,856
The old love story.

1705
01:45:28,522 --> 01:45:32,095
You are very slow.
The world is very fast.

1706
01:45:32,293 --> 01:45:34,864
Be careful when with me.

1707
01:45:35,296 --> 01:45:37,367
New song and music.

1708
01:45:38,799 --> 01:45:45,842
I don't know why I am
feeling so bored. - Is it?

1709
01:45:46,006 --> 01:45:49,249
Let's dance at least two steps.

1710
01:45:49,410 --> 01:45:51,515
New song and music.

1711
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:54,956
The old love story.

1712
01:45:58,486 --> 01:46:01,467
Raam said he'll be coming.
But he's not come yet.

1713
01:46:01,656 --> 01:46:03,431
He will surely come.

1714
01:46:07,862 --> 01:46:08,932
Sister.

1715
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:13,606
Mother. - Pooja.

1716
01:46:14,135 --> 01:46:15,580
My dear.

1717
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:20,943
Jyoti. - How are you, sister?

1718
01:46:21,108 --> 01:46:22,314
I'm fine.

1719
01:46:22,877 --> 01:46:24,356
Why don't you also
go inside the temple?

1720
01:46:24,545 --> 01:46:26,115
I cannot climb the stairs.

1721
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:27,850
Let God come down himself.

1722
01:46:28,049 --> 01:46:31,087
How's that possible?

1723
01:46:31,251 --> 01:46:32,559
I don't care.

1724
01:46:32,753 --> 01:46:34,232
Then why did you come?

1725
01:46:34,388 --> 01:46:35,560
You could've stayed at home?

1726
01:46:35,723 --> 01:46:38,363
Since my grandma has
gone to meet her secretly..

1727
01:46:38,525 --> 01:46:41,734
...my grandpa has sent
me to keep a watch on her.

1728
01:46:48,969 --> 01:46:50,505
How are you, Gunda? - Don't touch me.

1729
01:46:50,705 --> 01:46:52,707
She's your elder.

1730
01:46:52,907 --> 01:46:56,684
Hey. Don't you dare
into our personal matters?

1731
01:47:19,067 --> 01:47:20,102
Who are you?

1732
01:47:20,268 --> 01:47:22,544
Are you Spiderman? - Yes.

1733
01:47:27,441 --> 01:47:28,784
Why did you come here?

1734
01:47:28,942 --> 01:47:30,649
To know who great. You or me.

1735
01:47:30,811 --> 01:47:34,384
This is my area.
You cannot mess with me. - Alright.

1736
01:47:34,548 --> 01:47:36,027
Please forgive me.

1737
01:47:46,294 --> 01:47:49,764
Hereafter, will you respect
your elders? - I will.

1738
01:47:49,964 --> 01:47:53,935
My grandpa is a powerful man.

1739
01:47:54,101 --> 01:47:56,707
If you talk about your grandpa"

1740
01:47:56,871 --> 01:47:59,613
...I will nail you too like him.

1741
01:47:59,773 --> 01:48:00,808
No.

1742
01:48:00,974 --> 01:48:03,386
Will you respect your elders? - Okay.

1743
01:48:03,577 --> 01:48:05,284
Turn around. - Why?

1744
01:48:05,446 --> 01:48:07,187
I'm going to cut your plait.

1745
01:48:07,347 --> 01:48:09,122
That's the identity of our family.

1746
01:48:09,283 --> 01:48:11,126
To hell with your family.

1747
01:48:11,285 --> 01:48:12,457
Turn around.

1748
01:48:16,657 --> 01:48:18,432
Now, I only cut your plait.

1749
01:48:18,592 --> 01:48:21,368
If you don't respect your elders,
I will cut you to pieces.

1750
01:48:25,132 --> 01:48:27,635
Gunda, shall I give you bath? - No.

1751
01:48:27,802 --> 01:48:29,873
It is better to
do our work ourselves.

1752
01:48:30,070 --> 01:48:33,051
Oh my God. You've reform so much.

1753
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:35,652
Spiderman reformed me.

1754
01:48:43,551 --> 01:48:45,030
Hello? - Uncle..

1755
01:48:45,186 --> 01:48:47,530
...uncle Chikmali is
planning to get me married.

1756
01:48:48,355 --> 01:48:49,766
I don't want to get married.

1757
01:48:50,958 --> 01:48:52,835
I will only marry your son.

1758
01:48:52,994 --> 01:48:54,974
Otherwise, I will kill myself.

1759
01:48:55,163 --> 01:48:57,165
Dear, don't worry.

1760
01:48:57,331 --> 01:48:59,004
I will come right away.

1761
01:49:00,367 --> 01:49:04,213
Nagappa, summon our men.

1762
01:49:04,371 --> 01:49:08,979
Let's go to Chikmali's
house and finish everyone.

1763
01:49:09,143 --> 01:49:10,986
Sir, wait a minute. - Hey you.

1764
01:49:11,145 --> 01:49:12,317
Why are you concerned
about his family?

1765
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:15,359
Not just I, you too should
be concerned about them.

1766
01:49:15,549 --> 01:49:17,756
If you get your son married
to your sister's daughter..

1767
01:49:17,918 --> 01:49:18,953
...how much will you get?

1768
01:49:19,119 --> 01:49:21,497
100 corer US dollar.

1769
01:49:21,688 --> 01:49:26,034
Why do you want to fight
your brother for mere money?

1770
01:49:27,528 --> 01:49:30,304
Mere money?

1771
01:49:31,899 --> 01:49:34,971
If you get your married to
the girl who can get you 500 cores..

1772
01:49:35,136 --> 01:49:37,514
...it will be like you've attained
victory over Chikmali, right?

1773
01:49:37,705 --> 01:49:42,677
You're right, but who is that
rich man who'll give me 500 cores?

1774
01:49:42,877 --> 01:49:43,787
There is a man. - Where?

1775
01:49:43,944 --> 01:49:46,185
Uncle, tell him about
Chicago Chandrashekar.

1776
01:49:46,380 --> 01:49:48,690
Oh. He?

1777
01:49:48,883 --> 01:49:50,521
Also tell him about
his wealth and properties.

1778
01:49:50,685 --> 01:49:53,291
Probably, it worth round 500 cores.

1779
01:49:54,055 --> 01:49:57,002
Tell him about his daughter.
- Daughter?

1780
01:49:57,191 --> 01:49:59,330
The daughter who's grown up?

1781
01:49:59,493 --> 01:50:01,370
He's right.

1782
01:50:01,528 --> 01:50:03,599
In that case,
won't they look for a guy?

1783
01:50:03,764 --> 01:50:06,540
You're right.
- Then why don't you tell?

1784
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:08,441
Tell what? About who?

1785
01:50:08,603 --> 01:50:12,016
Tell them about
our sir's son Nagappa.

1786
01:50:12,506 --> 01:50:15,953
Murthy, I don't care how.

1787
01:50:16,110 --> 01:50:19,057
You must somehow see to that..

1788
01:50:19,246 --> 01:50:21,920
...they get the daughter
married to my son.

1789
01:50:22,082 --> 01:50:23,720
Understand? - No.

1790
01:50:23,884 --> 01:50:25,022
Idiot. - I understood.

1791
01:50:25,219 --> 01:50:29,133
In that case,
explain to your uncle briefly.

1792
01:50:29,623 --> 01:50:32,365
Having sympathy I
took good care of you..

1793
01:50:32,559 --> 01:50:34,664
...whereas you're
putting me in trouble.

1794
01:50:34,828 --> 01:50:35,829
Sir, what wrong did I do?

1795
01:50:36,029 --> 01:50:37,167
What wrong did you do?

1796
01:50:37,331 --> 01:50:39,868
I lied about Chicago
Chandrashekar to save myself.

1797
01:50:40,067 --> 01:50:41,045
But you are trying to make it true?

1798
01:50:41,201 --> 01:50:43,511
How will we create Chicago
Chandrashekar now? Tell me?

1799
01:50:43,704 --> 01:50:45,650
Dear.. - What is it?

1800
01:50:45,806 --> 01:50:47,979
Someone by the name
Chicago Chandrashekar..

1801
01:50:48,175 --> 01:50:51,213
...called five times since morning.

1802
01:50:51,378 --> 01:50:54,052
He's looking for a guy in this place.

1803
01:50:54,248 --> 01:50:56,421
So, he wants you to
book a guest house for him.

1804
01:50:56,617 --> 01:50:57,789
Oh God.

1805
01:50:57,952 --> 01:51:00,091
Sir, what do you say now?

1806
01:51:00,288 --> 01:51:02,666
You spoke about him
because you know him.

1807
01:51:02,823 --> 01:51:03,961
He called since you know him.

1808
01:51:04,125 --> 01:51:06,435
I swear by God.
I didn't understand a thing.

1809
01:51:07,594 --> 01:51:10,768
Sir, I understood everything.
- Understood what?

1810
01:51:12,233 --> 01:51:15,339
It is called subconscious
memory power loss.

1811
01:51:15,502 --> 01:51:16,981
Don't try to manipulate me.

1812
01:51:17,171 --> 01:51:18,673
There are three stages in our mind.

1813
01:51:18,872 --> 01:51:21,011
Conscious,
subconscious and unconscious.

1814
01:51:21,208 --> 01:51:23,210
Probably,
you're suffering from subconscious.

1815
01:51:23,377 --> 01:51:25,914
It is like,
though you know the person well..

1816
01:51:26,146 --> 01:51:27,420
...and if you don't
meet for a many days..

1817
01:51:27,581 --> 01:51:29,583
...you tend to forget the person"

1818
01:51:29,783 --> 01:51:31,262
...but you do know the person.

1819
01:51:31,419 --> 01:51:32,955
At times you remember him..

1820
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:34,656
...like the way you
remembered him now.

1821
01:51:34,822 --> 01:51:37,598
You're not insane to mention
his name though you don't know him?

1822
01:51:37,758 --> 01:51:39,795
You think he has discussed about
his daughter's marriage with me?

1823
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:41,405
Of course, insane.

1824
01:51:41,795 --> 01:51:43,365
Don't call me insane.

1825
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:44,941
I might doubt myself.

1826
01:51:45,132 --> 01:51:48,545
It's okay if you doubt yourself,
but you doubt me.

1827
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:51,080
I'm hurt. I'm leaving. - Raam.

1828
01:51:51,271 --> 01:51:52,579
Don't leave me and go.

1829
01:51:52,740 --> 01:51:55,186
Let's go and take
a look at the submarine.

1830
01:51:55,342 --> 01:51:57,788
It's not submarine,
subconscious memory power.

1831
01:51:57,978 --> 01:51:59,321
First stage? - No.

1832
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:00,550
Second.

1833
01:52:02,082 --> 01:52:06,497
I've neither heard of
him nor meet him. What do I do?

1834
01:52:06,653 --> 01:52:10,624
The character that I created
is asking me to book a guest house.

1835
01:52:10,824 --> 01:52:11,996
What's going on?

1836
01:52:12,159 --> 01:52:14,230
That's subconscious memory power.

1837
01:52:15,329 --> 01:52:17,605
Murthy, for how long should I wait?

1838
01:52:17,765 --> 01:52:19,108
Is he coming or not?

1839
01:52:19,300 --> 01:52:21,610
How will I be able to tell
you when I don't know myself?

1840
01:52:21,769 --> 01:52:23,771
He will be coming. Please sit inside.

1841
01:52:46,860 --> 01:52:47,804
Hello, sir.

1842
01:52:47,961 --> 01:52:49,565
Hey Murthy.

1843
01:52:49,730 --> 01:52:50,936
How are you?

1844
01:52:51,131 --> 01:52:54,078
Why are you surprised?
It's me, Chandrashekar.

1845
01:52:54,268 --> 01:52:55,975
Chicago Chandrashekar.

1846
01:52:57,271 --> 01:52:58,716
Come. Let's go. Come.

1847
01:52:58,906 --> 01:53:00,078
Please come.

1848
01:53:00,241 --> 01:53:02,187
Let's go, uncle. Come.

1849
01:53:05,145 --> 01:53:06,249
Please come in.

1850
01:53:06,614 --> 01:53:08,594
Stop. Who is he?

1851
01:53:08,782 --> 01:53:10,853
Why is he coming closer?

1852
01:53:11,819 --> 01:53:13,526
Murthy, who is he?

1853
01:53:13,687 --> 01:53:16,463
Tell me? Tell me?

1854
01:53:16,723 --> 01:53:18,794
Sir, my uncle is not
in the position to talk.

1855
01:53:18,959 --> 01:53:20,529
I will talk to them.

1856
01:53:22,129 --> 01:53:24,109
Sir, he's Mr. Doddamalayya.

1857
01:53:24,297 --> 01:53:26,140
The most dignified
man of his village.

1858
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:27,779
He wants to talk to you.

1859
01:53:28,168 --> 01:53:30,774
Wait a minute.

1860
01:53:30,938 --> 01:53:32,315
We want to get freshen up.

1861
01:53:32,472 --> 01:53:34,679
Murthy, you keep talking to them.

1862
01:53:34,875 --> 01:53:36,411
We'll be right back.

1863
01:53:38,879 --> 01:53:42,793
My uncle is in a shock since
he's meeting them after many years.

1864
01:53:42,983 --> 01:53:44,223
He's be fine in sometime.

1865
01:53:44,384 --> 01:53:45,658
Let's go.

1866
01:53:50,958 --> 01:53:53,029
What's the matter with Murthy?
- Sorry.

1867
01:53:53,227 --> 01:53:56,037
Sorry for making you wait.
- That's alright.

1868
01:53:56,230 --> 01:53:59,177
Murthy told us everything about you.

1869
01:53:59,366 --> 01:54:02,108
Murthy has great
respect for our family.

1870
01:54:02,536 --> 01:54:05,881
By the way, but he didn't
tell me that you were coming.

1871
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:12,282
Murthy told us that you
were looking for a guy. - Yes.

1872
01:54:12,446 --> 01:54:15,222
We give more importance
to tradition than money.

1873
01:54:15,382 --> 01:54:16,690
We too.

1874
01:54:16,883 --> 01:54:19,386
He's my younger son Nagappa.

1875
01:54:19,586 --> 01:54:21,691
He's studied 5th grade.

1876
01:54:21,889 --> 01:54:26,634
My desire is to get him married
to your daughter. - Murthy.

1877
01:54:26,793 --> 01:54:30,240
What kind of a guy you've
chosen for my daughter.

1878
01:54:30,397 --> 01:54:31,899
I didn't expect this from you.

1879
01:54:32,099 --> 01:54:33,077
Jackie? - Yes, Boss?

1880
01:54:33,267 --> 01:54:34,371
Send them out. - Okay, Boss.

1881
01:54:34,568 --> 01:54:37,071
Listen to.. - Just shut up. Get out!

1882
01:54:37,238 --> 01:54:40,310
Let go. - Idiot, you want hit me?

1883
01:54:40,474 --> 01:54:41,851
Come on. - Calm down. - Come on.

1884
01:54:42,008 --> 01:54:44,648
Boss, they are trying
to mess with me.

1885
01:54:44,812 --> 01:54:46,223
Uncle, come here.

1886
01:54:46,513 --> 01:54:48,186
Come. Let's go.

1887
01:54:48,381 --> 01:54:49,860
Chandrashekar..

1888
01:54:50,017 --> 01:54:51,394
Chandrashekar..

1889
01:54:51,585 --> 01:54:52,962
Chandru..

1890
01:54:54,288 --> 01:54:56,290
Uncle, wonderful.
You acted really well.

1891
01:54:56,457 --> 01:54:57,629
Who do you think I am?

1892
01:54:57,791 --> 01:55:00,169
I'm two times gold
winner in mono acting.

1893
01:55:00,327 --> 01:55:01,670
Raam?

1894
01:55:01,962 --> 01:55:03,032
Yes, aunt.

1895
01:55:03,197 --> 01:55:06,178
Dear, what's going on?

1896
01:55:06,366 --> 01:55:08,073
Aunt, you liked Pooja, didn't you?

1897
01:55:08,235 --> 01:55:11,045
Of course, I liked her very much.
That's why we are here.

1898
01:55:11,238 --> 01:55:12,581
Let's take her along.

1899
01:55:12,739 --> 01:55:16,846
But these men.. - Laxmi, do not fear.

1900
01:55:17,043 --> 01:55:22,049
He's been acting ever
since his childhood.

1901
01:55:22,215 --> 01:55:24,058
It is very interesting. Tell me?

1902
01:55:24,218 --> 01:55:25,253
What's the next scene?

1903
01:55:25,419 --> 01:55:27,330
Next scene is not yours.

1904
01:55:28,389 --> 01:55:31,836
Sir, they have few conditions to get
their daughter married to your son.

1905
01:55:32,025 --> 01:55:34,403
What are they? - Since Uncle
and I don't agree to the conditions..

1906
01:55:34,561 --> 01:55:35,801
...we refused them.

1907
01:55:35,963 --> 01:55:38,136
Who are you to refuse?

1908
01:55:38,299 --> 01:55:41,508
Tell us about the conditions.

1909
01:55:41,669 --> 01:55:44,115
They didn't like your attire.

1910
01:55:44,271 --> 01:55:46,046
They said,
you look like an agent with it.

1911
01:55:46,240 --> 01:55:49,687
What? We look like agents?

1912
01:55:49,843 --> 01:55:51,550
Look, you're getting upset now.

1913
01:55:51,712 --> 01:55:54,022
Just let that be.

1914
01:55:54,181 --> 01:55:56,024
How dare they say that?

1915
01:55:56,183 --> 01:56:01,030
They expect us to dress up like them?

1916
01:56:01,722 --> 01:56:04,134
We will do it.

1917
01:56:04,958 --> 01:56:06,369
They have two more conditions.

1918
01:56:06,527 --> 01:56:07,870
Two more conditions?

1919
01:56:08,061 --> 01:56:10,803
They were a little upset
when they didn't find any woman..

1920
01:56:10,998 --> 01:56:13,274
"Present while you were
discussing about marriage.

1921
01:56:16,203 --> 01:56:18,308
I will surely bring them.

1922
01:56:18,705 --> 01:56:21,117
What is the third condition?

1923
01:56:21,275 --> 01:56:22,652
Actually.. - Actually?

1924
01:56:22,843 --> 01:56:24,322
Actually.. - Actually?

1925
01:56:24,511 --> 01:56:25,615
They want you to cut your plait.

1926
01:56:25,812 --> 01:56:27,485
Cut my plait?

1927
01:56:29,449 --> 01:56:32,828
Why should you cut your
plait just for 500 cores?

1928
01:56:33,019 --> 01:56:34,430
I told them it's impossible.

1929
01:56:34,621 --> 01:56:36,123
Let's find another girl for your son.

1930
01:56:36,290 --> 01:56:38,531
What do you say, uncle?
- You're right.

1931
01:56:38,692 --> 01:56:41,764
Why do you involve
him in this matter?

1932
01:56:42,462 --> 01:56:44,464
I can always grow plait again..

1933
01:56:44,631 --> 01:56:47,578
...but I can never
let go 500 corer dollars.

1934
01:56:47,734 --> 01:56:50,806
You're right, grandpa.
Cut your plait.

1935
01:56:50,971 --> 01:56:55,317
Okay. I'm ready to cut my plait.

1936
01:57:14,961 --> 01:57:19,205
Chicago Chandrashekar? His family?

1937
01:57:19,533 --> 01:57:21,979
I'm unable to recall.

1938
01:57:22,135 --> 01:57:24,775
But I know them.

1939
01:57:25,806 --> 01:57:28,810
By the way, what is the name
of the disease I'm suffering from?

1940
01:57:29,009 --> 01:57:30,113
It isn't a disease.

1941
01:57:30,310 --> 01:57:31,812
Subconscious memory power.

1942
01:57:31,978 --> 01:57:35,482
Is something wrong with it?
- I feel so.

1943
01:57:35,649 --> 01:57:37,026
If this condition persists"

1944
01:57:37,217 --> 01:57:42,565
...you will develop a
tendency to commit suicide.

1945
01:57:42,722 --> 01:57:44,895
You're right. I feel it at times.

1946
01:57:45,092 --> 01:57:46,901
In that case, you will die for sure.

1947
01:57:47,060 --> 01:57:48,437
Stop scaring me.

1948
01:57:49,162 --> 01:57:50,835
What's the remedy?

1949
01:57:51,064 --> 01:57:52,099
Remedy? - Yes.

1950
01:57:52,265 --> 01:57:55,109
Blindly believing in things.

1951
01:57:55,869 --> 01:57:58,748
But if you're in a
confused state of mind..

1952
01:57:58,905 --> 01:58:00,384
You will develop a
tendency to commit suicide.

1953
01:58:00,541 --> 01:58:03,545
So, you expect n1e to
blindly believing in things?

1954
01:58:03,710 --> 01:58:05,781
You have no other option.

1955
01:58:05,946 --> 01:58:07,323
In that case,
I will blindly believe what you say.

1956
01:58:17,257 --> 01:58:20,238
Very good. I'm glad.

1957
01:58:20,393 --> 01:58:22,202
You've changed so much.

1958
01:58:22,395 --> 01:58:25,808
We just want to meet
your expectations.

1959
01:58:25,999 --> 01:58:28,206
We like your son very much.

1960
01:58:28,535 --> 01:58:31,345
Let's fix the marriage
as soon as possible.

1961
01:58:31,672 --> 01:58:33,549
By the way, Mr. Doddamalayya.. - Yes?

1962
01:58:33,707 --> 01:58:35,948
Don't you have brother?

1963
01:58:36,142 --> 01:58:41,057
Sir, he does have a
younger brother. - What?

1964
01:58:41,381 --> 01:58:43,224
He has a younger brother? - Yes.

1965
01:58:43,383 --> 01:58:45,761
Having a brother, you came
alone to discuss about marriage?

1966
01:58:45,952 --> 01:58:46,987
Darn it.

1967
01:58:47,153 --> 01:58:48,393
You've mistaken.

1968
01:58:48,588 --> 01:58:50,829
Both the brothers are known
for their affection on each other.

1969
01:58:50,990 --> 01:58:54,096
Actually, he's out of town. - Oh.

1970
01:58:54,261 --> 01:58:56,639
Murthy. - His son is a nice guy.

1971
01:58:56,830 --> 01:58:59,504
Please try me. - Okay, Murthy.

1972
01:58:59,699 --> 01:59:03,772
In that case, we will fix
the marriage after your returns back.

1973
01:59:03,970 --> 01:59:06,450
Okay? Darling, let's go.

1974
01:59:06,606 --> 01:59:07,812
Oh God.

1975
01:59:07,975 --> 01:59:09,352
You put me in trouble.

1976
01:59:10,643 --> 01:59:11,986
Why did you tell him
that I have a brother?

1977
01:59:12,179 --> 01:59:13,249
What's wrong in telling the truth?

1978
01:59:13,413 --> 01:59:14,983
Isn't Chenmallappa
responsible for his birth]?

1979
01:59:15,182 --> 01:59:16,320
Chenmallappa? - Who is he?

1980
01:59:16,483 --> 01:59:17,928
Your father.

1981
01:59:18,085 --> 01:59:21,464
Now how will bring my brother?

1982
01:59:23,357 --> 01:59:24,802
You see that?

1983
01:59:24,992 --> 01:59:27,996
He's now regretting
for going against me.

1984
01:59:28,161 --> 01:59:31,267
Now Doddamalayya is
looking for another girl.

1985
01:59:31,431 --> 01:59:34,742
Look at his condition.
He has become like a helpless snake.

1986
01:59:34,935 --> 01:59:39,008
Uncle, I think there's
something fishy.

1987
01:59:39,173 --> 01:59:41,084
Shut up.

1988
01:59:41,408 --> 01:59:46,016
<i>I'm sure he's regretting
for going against me.</i>

1989
01:59:46,279 --> 01:59:47,485
Good evening, everybody.

1990
01:59:47,681 --> 01:59:49,058
Sorry for the interruption.

1991
01:59:49,216 --> 01:59:50,559
Collect the valuation
of all the things. - Okay, sir.

1992
01:59:50,717 --> 01:59:52,060
Come on. Hello.

1993
01:59:52,219 --> 01:59:53,220
Who are you?

1994
01:59:53,420 --> 01:59:54,831
Hi, Pooja. How are you?

1995
01:59:55,022 --> 01:59:55,830
Fine, uncle.

1996
01:59:56,022 --> 01:59:57,296
Hello. - Hey.

1997
01:59:57,491 --> 01:59:58,868
Who are you?

1998
01:59:59,993 --> 02:00:01,165
<i>Tm Poornachandrarao.</i>

1999
02:00:01,361 --> 02:00:03,500
Recovery officer from World Bank.

2000
02:00:03,663 --> 02:00:06,337
I'm familiar with most of the banks.

2001
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:08,207
But I haven't heard of World Bank?

2002
02:00:08,401 --> 02:00:10,074
It is a most popular bank.

2003
02:00:10,237 --> 02:00:11,978
By the way, why did you come here?

2004
02:00:12,172 --> 02:00:14,174
Pooja's father died before
he could repay the loan..

2005
02:00:14,374 --> 02:00:16,081
...that he'd taken from our bank.

2006
02:00:16,276 --> 02:00:18,483
His property in America
has already been seized.

2007
02:00:18,678 --> 02:00:21,056
Still 100 cores are left.

2008
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:23,489
She's the surety. Ask her yourself.

2009
02:00:23,650 --> 02:00:26,631
He's right, uncle.
- So, we are here to recover it.

2010
02:00:26,786 --> 02:00:29,198
She has nothing
with her to give away.

2011
02:00:29,356 --> 02:00:31,563
She's getting married
to my uncle's son next week.

2012
02:00:31,758 --> 02:00:33,863
Very good, sir. - What do you mean?

2013
02:00:34,027 --> 02:00:36,064
According to the Hindu act..

2014
02:00:36,263 --> 02:00:39,142
...the wife gets 50 percent
of her husband's share.

2015
02:00:39,299 --> 02:00:41,279
We will take that away.

2016
02:00:41,468 --> 02:00:43,175
Is he right?

2017
02:00:43,336 --> 02:00:45,145
Sir, that's a rule.

2018
02:00:45,305 --> 02:00:46,978
My uncle is really unfortunate.

2019
02:00:47,140 --> 02:00:51,611
Sir, the marriage
didn't take place yet.

2020
02:00:51,812 --> 02:00:53,723
She seems to be a nice girl.

2021
02:00:53,880 --> 02:00:55,450
Don't delay anymore.

2022
02:00:55,616 --> 02:00:56,890
Get her married off.

2023
02:00:57,083 --> 02:00:58,323
We will wait.

2024
02:00:58,451 --> 02:01:00,692
Not just 1 to 2, it is 100 cores.

2025
02:01:00,887 --> 02:01:02,093
We will surely recover it.

2026
02:01:02,289 --> 02:01:03,427
BYE; P00ja. - Bye, uncle.

2027
02:01:03,590 --> 02:01:04,694
Sir..

2028
02:01:05,625 --> 02:01:07,434
Pooja, go inside.

2029
02:01:07,594 --> 02:01:10,097
Uncle.. - I said go inside.

2030
02:01:11,231 --> 02:01:13,802
What do I do now?

2031
02:01:14,267 --> 02:01:15,268
Hey? - Yes?

2032
02:01:15,468 --> 02:01:16,378
M u rthy?

2033
02:01:16,536 --> 02:01:18,277
Why did you betray me? - Sir?

2034
02:01:18,438 --> 02:01:22,409
Why didn't you tell me
about Chandrashekar's daughter?

2035
02:01:22,609 --> 02:01:24,885
Sir, it is not my uncle's fault.

2036
02:01:25,078 --> 02:01:28,252
He did it so that you
retain your daughter-in-law.

2037
02:01:28,415 --> 02:01:32,124
So, you want me to be at loss?

2038
02:01:32,319 --> 02:01:33,696
I don't care how.

2039
02:01:33,887 --> 02:01:35,491
You will talk to
Chandrashekar about my son.

2040
02:01:35,689 --> 02:01:38,693
That's impossible. He has
already committed to Doddamalayya.

2041
02:01:38,858 --> 02:01:40,394
Uncle, don't worry.

2042
02:01:40,593 --> 02:01:41,571
I have an idea.

2043
02:01:41,762 --> 02:01:43,799
Chicago Chandrashekar
has a younger brother.

2044
02:01:43,963 --> 02:01:46,068
He will be here to find
a guy for his daughter.

2045
02:01:46,266 --> 02:01:48,405
Younger brother? - Dollars Dinesh.

2046
02:01:48,602 --> 02:01:50,741
You do know him, right? - I?

2047
02:01:50,904 --> 02:01:53,942
Sir, you should proceed
with this alliance.

2048
02:01:54,141 --> 02:01:56,485
My uncle will make it happen.

2049
02:01:56,643 --> 02:01:59,817
Murthy, you're not an ordinary man.

2050
02:01:59,980 --> 02:02:01,891
Even I realized now.

2051
02:02:02,082 --> 02:02:03,993
Uncle, tell him about it.

2052
02:02:04,184 --> 02:02:06,664
About what? - About the conditions.

2053
02:02:07,220 --> 02:02:10,201
Okay. They have many conditions.

2054
02:02:23,236 --> 02:02:25,341
Brother! - Brother!

2055
02:02:25,505 --> 02:02:28,008
I know you're pretending.

2056
02:02:28,208 --> 02:02:30,620
I know why you're here.

2057
02:02:30,777 --> 02:02:32,916
You told me about Chicago
chandrashekar younger brother.

2058
02:02:33,112 --> 02:02:35,058
But said his name is Dinesh?

2059
02:02:35,248 --> 02:02:36,886
You. - I?

2060
02:02:37,050 --> 02:02:38,654
So, whatever I say
will turn out to be true?

2061
02:02:38,852 --> 02:02:39,830
Haven't you realized it is happening?

2062
02:02:39,986 --> 02:02:41,988
Everything that you predicted"

2063
02:02:42,188 --> 02:02:43,428
...has turned out to be true.

2064
02:02:43,623 --> 02:02:44,829
Let's go.

2065
02:02:46,926 --> 02:02:48,132
Come on.

2066
02:02:54,534 --> 02:02:56,013
Welcome. - Hello.

2067
02:02:56,202 --> 02:02:58,273
Hello. - He's my younger
brother Chikmalla.

2068
02:02:58,438 --> 02:02:59,280
Hello, sir.

2069
02:02:59,439 --> 02:03:02,010
He's my younger brother
Dollars Dinesh. - Hello.

2070
02:03:04,177 --> 02:03:05,121
Hi, everyblidY-

2071
02:03:05,278 --> 02:03:07,724
Mr. M.C. Murthy, how are you?

2072
02:03:07,881 --> 02:03:09,451
Mr. M.C. Murthy.

2073
02:03:10,083 --> 02:03:14,122
Look at his stomach.
He seems be leading a happy life.

2074
02:03:14,321 --> 02:03:16,597
He's eating all the time.

2075
02:03:16,756 --> 02:03:19,202
Let's go inside.

2076
02:03:20,027 --> 02:03:21,438
Let's go.

2077
02:03:22,896 --> 02:03:25,968
Didn't I tell you? Your predictions
will surely turn out to be true.

2078
02:03:26,132 --> 02:03:30,103
The characters that I'm creating
are coming alive one after the other.

2079
02:03:30,270 --> 02:03:31,874
It is because of the
power you have in you.

2080
02:03:32,071 --> 02:03:34,073
That means.. I'm God.

2081
02:03:34,240 --> 02:03:37,187
Ravichandran is the God of love
and you're the God of intelligence.

2082
02:03:37,377 --> 02:03:38,879
Darn it. I never realized
I was so intelligent.

2083
02:03:39,079 --> 02:03:42,219
I've been working in
this house like a servant.

2084
02:03:45,652 --> 02:03:48,758
What do you like doing
during your leisure time?

2085
02:03:48,922 --> 02:03:51,300
I wash dishes,
wash clothes, clean bathroom.

2086
02:03:51,458 --> 02:03:53,404
And then I again wash
the dishes and go to bed.

2087
02:03:53,560 --> 02:03:57,440
You do all this work alone, dear?

2088
02:03:57,630 --> 02:03:59,769
Yes. This is how it is in America.

2089
02:03:59,933 --> 02:04:01,970
People do their work themselves.

2090
02:04:05,838 --> 02:04:07,943
Idiot. How dare you?

2091
02:04:08,108 --> 02:04:09,587
I will break your leg.

2092
02:04:09,742 --> 02:04:11,153
Behave yourself.

2093
02:04:11,344 --> 02:04:14,052
Father, she's acting weird.

2094
02:04:14,214 --> 02:04:18,560
You have to tolerate her for money.

2095
02:04:20,086 --> 02:04:20,996
I don't like it.

2096
02:04:21,154 --> 02:04:22,326
Excuse me.

2097
02:04:22,488 --> 02:04:23,899
Mr. Chikmalayya. - Who is it?

2098
02:04:24,057 --> 02:04:25,434
What I heard, is it true?

2099
02:04:25,592 --> 02:04:27,503
Hello, Mr.
Chandradshekhar, how are you?

2100
02:04:27,660 --> 02:04:28,968
Hello, Raam.

2101
02:04:29,162 --> 02:04:31,768
Sir, do you know him?

2102
02:04:31,931 --> 02:04:33,342
He's my family friend.

2103
02:04:33,499 --> 02:04:35,945
He was the main reason
for our world bank to prosper.

2104
02:04:36,135 --> 02:04:38,411
His food..
- Sir, come have food with us.

2105
02:04:38,572 --> 02:04:40,074
Oh, thank you. Please, come.

2106
02:04:40,273 --> 02:04:43,743
That is the reason they say,
the world is round.

2107
02:04:44,144 --> 02:04:45,555
Ra, what made you come here?

2108
02:04:45,745 --> 02:04:50,251
I had an important work. First
tell me what made you come here?

2109
02:04:50,417 --> 02:04:53,455
We thought of getting our
son married to their daughter.

2110
02:04:53,619 --> 02:04:55,292
Is it true, Mr. Chikkamallya?

2111
02:04:55,455 --> 02:04:57,958
You said that you'll get
your niece married to your son?

2112
02:04:58,158 --> 02:05:01,662
Listen, mister. We know
where to get our daughter married.

2113
02:05:01,828 --> 02:05:04,536
You keep quiet. - Whatever it is,
I don't feel good, sir.

2114
02:05:04,731 --> 02:05:07,177
First think about
your sister's daughter.

2115
02:05:07,333 --> 02:05:09,176
Let's talk about our
children wedding later.

2116
02:05:09,336 --> 02:05:12,977
How can we marry her all of a sudden?

2117
02:05:13,139 --> 02:05:15,085
We should find a good groom for her.

2118
02:05:15,241 --> 02:05:16,686
You can do anything
if you really want to.

2119
02:05:16,843 --> 02:05:18,686
No problem if it is late.
We'll wait for you.

2120
02:05:19,546 --> 02:05:21,423
What will you do waiting?

2121
02:05:23,950 --> 02:05:26,988
I don't know from
where he's come from.

2122
02:05:27,153 --> 02:05:28,928
They are dancing on his tunes.

2123
02:05:29,122 --> 02:05:31,102
What is the reason.. - Sir..

2124
02:05:31,257 --> 02:05:33,430
Sir, one minute.
Please, come with me, sir.

2125
02:05:33,593 --> 02:05:37,063
Hey, let go. Idiot. Who are you?

2126
02:05:37,831 --> 02:05:39,174
You're Krishnamurthy, isn't it?

2127
02:05:39,332 --> 02:05:42,745
Everyone knows that. There's
a different Murthy for this world.

2128
02:05:43,603 --> 02:05:45,844
So, you mean to say is there's
another world too. - Shut up.

2129
02:05:46,039 --> 02:05:48,315
What world are you talking about?

2130
02:05:51,077 --> 02:05:54,354
This world means nothing to n1e.
If I wish, I can event a new world.

2131
02:05:54,547 --> 02:05:56,254
You can event a new world?

2132
02:05:57,216 --> 02:05:59,218
Is Tippayya your nephew?

2133
02:05:59,419 --> 02:06:01,456
His name is not Tippayya, but Raam.

2134
02:06:01,654 --> 02:06:04,157
Whatever..
what do you know about him?

2135
02:06:04,324 --> 02:06:05,701
Sir, what do you know about him?

2136
02:06:11,197 --> 02:06:13,507
The heart is still beating.
Come on, cool down.

2137
02:06:13,700 --> 02:06:15,907
You shouldn't lose hope at this time.

2138
02:06:16,102 --> 02:06:18,139
What can we do? It was our bad time.

2139
02:06:18,304 --> 02:06:20,614
You're like a healer
to the dying man.

2140
02:06:20,807 --> 02:06:23,117
What are both of them doing here?

2141
02:06:23,576 --> 02:06:24,554
Brother-in-law,
what are you doing here?

2142
02:06:24,711 --> 02:06:25,746
Chicago Chandrashekhar
is calling you inside.

2143
02:06:25,912 --> 02:06:30,918
Hello.. don't try to act smart now.
I've told your whole story to him.

2144
02:06:31,117 --> 02:06:33,654
Shut up. just shut up. - Okay.

2145
02:06:33,853 --> 02:06:36,424
Be careful while talking to him.
He's acting smart.

2146
02:06:36,589 --> 02:06:39,092
Who's calling me?
- Chicago Chandrashekhar.

2147
02:06:39,292 --> 02:06:42,603
Why? Didn't Dollars
Dinesh or Laxmi call me?

2148
02:06:42,762 --> 02:06:44,264
Brother-in-law,
what's wrong with you?

2149
02:06:44,464 --> 02:06:46,910
Brother-in-law?
Who's your brother-in-law?

2150
02:06:47,067 --> 02:06:49,809
Am I the creator? Am I Lord Brahma?

2151
02:06:49,969 --> 02:06:51,573
I'll kill you right away.

2152
02:06:51,771 --> 02:06:55,218
Don't kill him now.
Let him repent for his sins.

2153
02:06:55,374 --> 02:06:58,048
I am repenting for his sins.

2154
02:06:58,245 --> 02:07:00,725
You don't show your face to me.
Get lost.

2155
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:02,826
If I get angry, I'll bite you.
- No. No.

2156
02:07:03,015 --> 02:07:04,221
What happened to you, brother-in-law?

2157
02:07:04,417 --> 02:07:06,829
Brother-in-law? Who's brother-in-law?

2158
02:07:06,986 --> 02:07:08,556
Go to hell.
- Brother-in-law? Brother-in-law?

2159
02:07:08,721 --> 02:07:12,498
Hello.. hello, he left. He left.

2160
02:07:12,659 --> 02:07:14,036
Go and do your work now.

2161
02:07:14,193 --> 02:07:16,764
You consoled me like
a patient at that time.

2162
02:07:16,930 --> 02:07:18,375
Now you're consoling
me like mourning.

2163
02:07:18,531 --> 02:07:20,977
Cool down. Cool down, sir.
Why are you getting so tensed?

2164
02:07:21,167 --> 02:07:22,544
There are lots of things to do.
Come on, let's go.

2165
02:07:22,702 --> 02:07:24,477
Hey, you belong to the different world..

2166
02:07:24,671 --> 02:07:26,082
...and I belong to the different world.

2167
02:07:26,239 --> 02:07:28,845
I'll ruin everyone now. - Big deal.

2168
02:07:29,175 --> 02:07:31,280
Bye Murthy. - Oh brother Murthy. Bye.

2169
02:07:31,478 --> 02:07:32,388
Goodbye. We shall leave now.

2170
02:07:32,578 --> 02:07:35,354
Murthy..
you didn't have food. - I will.

2171
02:07:35,515 --> 02:07:36,960
Please, go and have food.

2172
02:07:37,149 --> 02:07:39,254
How is your wife?
Give my regards to her. - She's fine.

2173
02:07:39,452 --> 02:07:40,522
Anything else you
want me to tell her?

2174
02:07:40,686 --> 02:07:41,858
Nothing. Please, go ahead.

2175
02:07:42,021 --> 02:07:43,762
They are acting as though
they know me from ages.

2176
02:07:43,923 --> 02:07:45,095
To hell with Murthy now.

2177
02:07:45,257 --> 02:07:48,966
Until we get her married. They'll
not fix marriage with our son.

2178
02:07:49,128 --> 02:07:51,734
Hello, sir. - Thrash this man first.

2179
02:07:51,931 --> 02:07:55,208
Thrash me later..
forget this alliance now. - Why?

2180
02:07:55,368 --> 02:07:58,247
Sir, they've kept this
condition intentionally.

2181
02:07:58,405 --> 02:08:01,978
Either of you two get your sister's
daughter married to your son.

2182
02:08:02,175 --> 02:08:04,314
Shut up!

2183
02:08:04,477 --> 02:08:07,458
If bank people seize
all our property..

2184
02:08:07,647 --> 02:08:10,787
...do you expect us to beg
for alms standing on the road?

2185
02:08:10,950 --> 02:08:13,624
Do you want to see that? Shut up!

2186
02:08:14,120 --> 02:08:16,430
Where's your nephew? Call him here.

2187
02:08:17,523 --> 02:08:19,196
He's not here. He went to village.

2188
02:08:19,359 --> 02:08:21,236
Did you hear that?
He left to village.

2189
02:08:21,427 --> 02:08:22,997
How did he leave
without informing us?

2190
02:08:23,163 --> 02:08:24,767
How did he leave? - If he was here..

2191
02:08:24,931 --> 02:08:27,002
...would you get your sister's
daughter married to him?

2192
02:08:27,767 --> 02:08:28,905
What did you say?

2193
02:08:29,235 --> 02:08:31,613
It slipped from my tongue.
Please, forgive me.

2194
02:08:33,339 --> 02:08:35,285
Sir, I didn't tell it intentionally.
Will you kill me now?

2195
02:08:35,475 --> 02:08:38,684
Murthy.. you're not wrong,
but you told right thing.

2196
02:08:38,878 --> 02:08:41,449
Why cant it be possible as you said?

2197
02:08:41,614 --> 02:08:43,355
Sir, please don't. his mother
was looking for a bride for him..

2198
02:08:43,549 --> 02:08:44,527
...so I sent him to the village.

2199
02:08:44,684 --> 02:08:45,992
Let us call him back.

2200
02:08:46,152 --> 02:08:49,031
Does your nephew have property?

2201
02:08:49,222 --> 02:08:51,828
He's a beggar, sir. He's taken
credit from everyone in the village.

2202
02:08:52,024 --> 02:08:53,731
He'll repay them back.

2203
02:08:53,927 --> 02:08:55,702
Sir.. - Sir!

2204
02:08:56,162 --> 02:08:58,972
Hey, are you uncle and
nephew playing games with us?

2205
02:08:59,132 --> 02:09:00,975
Your uncle just said
that you went to the village.

2206
02:09:01,167 --> 02:09:03,943
I was leaving, sir. I thought I would
take your blessings before leaving.

2207
02:09:04,103 --> 02:09:05,946
Is it? Okay. Good.

2208
02:09:06,139 --> 02:09:08,881
You belong to us now.

2209
02:09:10,577 --> 02:09:16,755
Now, we've decided that we get
our sister's daughter married to you.

2210
02:09:16,950 --> 02:09:18,088
What do you say?

2211
02:09:18,284 --> 02:09:20,093
No problem with me, sir.
But my uncle will tell you.

2212
02:09:20,253 --> 02:09:22,028
Remove your hand.

2213
02:09:22,221 --> 02:09:26,431
Sir, my sister is very orthodox, she
wont agree for inter caste marriage.

2214
02:09:26,626 --> 02:09:28,230
You used to agree
for everything earlier..

2215
02:09:28,394 --> 02:09:29,998
...now you're showing attitude to us.

2216
02:09:30,263 --> 02:09:32,971
Hey, you should agree
to whatever we say.

2217
02:09:33,132 --> 02:09:35,373
Tell me. - Yes.

2218
02:09:35,534 --> 02:09:37,775
Pooja.. dear Pooja!

2219
02:09:39,005 --> 02:09:40,609
Come here. - What is it, uncle?

2220
02:09:40,773 --> 02:09:44,949
We both have decided that
we'll get you married to Raam.

2221
02:09:45,111 --> 02:09:46,749
What do you say?

2222
02:09:47,079 --> 02:09:51,050
Your wish, uncle. I don't
mind if you change my name to Sta.

2223
02:09:54,720 --> 02:09:56,097
What say? Tell me.

2224
02:09:56,256 --> 02:09:57,462
Sir, there's a small problem.

2225
02:09:57,624 --> 02:10:00,628
Like my uncle said,
my mother is very orthodox.

2226
02:10:00,793 --> 02:10:05,242
Our Santosh said that somebody
abducted her from the wedding dais..

2227
02:10:05,398 --> 02:10:09,278
...my mother will create
a chaos if she knows this.

2228
02:10:09,469 --> 02:10:11,210
Is that all? - Yes, sir.

2229
02:10:11,370 --> 02:10:13,077
Call that Santosh here.

2230
02:10:14,707 --> 02:10:16,118
Sir, greetings.

2231
02:10:16,309 --> 02:10:17,982
Why are you respecting me so much?

2232
02:10:18,144 --> 02:10:22,615
Who abducted Ms.
Pooja from the wedding dais?

2233
02:10:22,782 --> 02:10:23,954
Didn't I show you in the photo?

2234
02:10:24,484 --> 02:10:27,226
Oh God.. sir, why are you hitting me?

2235
02:10:27,420 --> 02:10:28,728
That's a lie. A lie. - Then?

2236
02:10:28,888 --> 02:10:30,492
He abducted her.

2237
02:10:31,991 --> 02:10:36,303
Correct, sir. It was him.
It was him who abducted her.

2238
02:10:36,462 --> 02:10:38,874
Correct. Whoever ask you from now on,
tell them the same thing.

2239
02:10:39,065 --> 02:10:40,669
I'll tell them, sir. - Okay, go.

2240
02:10:40,833 --> 02:10:43,006
Shall I leave, sir?
- Go and do your work. Go.

2241
02:10:43,202 --> 02:10:46,911
Whatever you say.. Murthy
has become our relative from now on.

2242
02:10:49,509 --> 02:10:52,956
Sorry.. Mr.
Murthy I cant understand anything.

2243
02:10:53,146 --> 02:10:56,958
Even if I've understood it,
I am unable to do anything. - Is it?

2244
02:10:57,183 --> 02:11:00,357
Call me later..
cow is calling me now. Sorry.

2245
02:11:01,087 --> 02:11:06,127
That's the reason I said,
you can do anything if you want to.

2246
02:11:06,326 --> 02:11:08,932
What do we do?
Murthy is our servant..

2247
02:11:09,128 --> 02:11:11,699
...yet he is very honest to us. So..

2248
02:11:11,898 --> 02:11:13,809
Sir, if you're so proud about me..
raise my salary by Rs. 500.

2249
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:15,206
I don't agree to this marriage.

2250
02:11:15,401 --> 02:11:18,211
Forget it, sir. If my uncle
didn't agree to this marriage..

2251
02:11:18,371 --> 02:11:19,714
...even my mother wont agree.

2252
02:11:19,906 --> 02:11:22,443
Even I wont feel good to marry
like an orphan in their absence.

2253
02:11:23,676 --> 02:11:26,555
Raam, I can understand your pain.

2254
02:11:26,746 --> 02:11:28,157
Mr. Murthy.. - Sir..

2255
02:11:28,314 --> 02:11:30,225
How will be Raam related to us?

2256
02:11:30,382 --> 02:11:31,292
Sir, who knows?

2257
02:11:31,484 --> 02:11:33,191
I've already forgotten
all my relationships.

2258
02:11:33,352 --> 02:11:35,958
I am into the second stage.
- Shut up.

2259
02:11:36,122 --> 02:11:39,035
You're acting too much these days.

2260
02:11:39,225 --> 02:11:42,502
He'll be like your son, relative.
- Correct, sir.

2261
02:11:42,662 --> 02:11:44,471
Anyways we don't have son.

2262
02:11:44,664 --> 02:11:46,803
We'll get his wedding arranged.

2263
02:11:46,966 --> 02:11:49,207
We'll feel happy
about our son's wedding.

2264
02:11:49,402 --> 02:11:51,643
I am relieved now.

2265
02:11:51,837 --> 02:11:55,478
I shall organize the
wedding with grand pomp.

2266
02:11:55,641 --> 02:11:57,917
Hey Raama!

2267
02:12:03,382 --> 02:12:05,623
Hey Raama!

2268
02:12:09,355 --> 02:12:10,663
Hey Raama!

2269
02:12:13,192 --> 02:12:14,569
Hey Raama!

2270
02:12:17,263 --> 02:12:21,040
Play the drums! Oh jovial guy!

2271
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:24,841
Play the drums! Oh jovial guy!

2272
02:12:25,004 --> 02:12:27,109
I don't have parents.

2273
02:12:27,273 --> 02:12:29,219
Who brought me up?

2274
02:12:29,375 --> 02:12:31,855
I salute them from far.

2275
02:12:32,679 --> 02:12:34,852
Play the drums! Oh jovial guy!

2276
02:12:35,047 --> 02:12:36,856
I am the sweet Sikander for love.

2277
02:12:37,016 --> 02:12:39,792
I became your slave.

2278
02:12:40,486 --> 02:12:44,332
Don't delay Raama.
My love is waiting for you.

2279
02:12:44,490 --> 02:12:48,438
Sing love songs today
sitting on a throne.

2280
02:12:48,627 --> 02:12:52,336
Dance with joy.

2281
02:12:52,531 --> 02:12:56,069
Dance with joy.

2282
02:12:56,268 --> 02:13:00,011
Dance with joy.

2283
02:13:00,172 --> 02:13:03,517
Dance with joy.

2284
02:13:38,411 --> 02:13:43,190
All the villagers are
talking about our marriage.

2285
02:13:43,616 --> 02:13:47,086
Talking about our marriage.
Hear it.

2286
02:13:50,055 --> 02:13:55,164
People from 27 villages
will be attending our wedding.

2287
02:13:55,361 --> 02:13:56,965
What else do you need?

2288
02:13:57,396 --> 02:13:59,239
For the bride..
- Does she want silk sari?

2289
02:13:59,431 --> 02:14:01,206
For the people.
- Food in abundance.

2290
02:14:01,367 --> 02:14:05,406
She's calling me from her heart.

2291
02:14:05,605 --> 02:14:09,348
Dance with joy.

2292
02:14:09,509 --> 02:14:12,979
Dance with joy.

2293
02:14:13,346 --> 02:14:17,089
Dance with joy.

2294
02:14:17,250 --> 02:14:20,561
Dance with joy.

2295
02:14:22,388 --> 02:14:25,232
Oh Lord. Oh Shabba.

2296
02:14:26,325 --> 02:14:28,965
Oh Lord. Oh Shabba.

2297
02:14:30,195 --> 02:14:33,142
Oh Lord. Oh Shabba.

2298
02:14:34,066 --> 02:14:36,546
Oh Lord. Oh Shabba.

2299
02:14:52,118 --> 02:14:56,828
Let's become a good couple
and show it to the world.

2300
02:14:57,323 --> 02:14:59,894
Listen to me, dear.

2301
02:15:03,596 --> 02:15:08,807
The wedding should be so grand,
gods from above should see us.

2302
02:15:08,968 --> 02:15:10,743
Let they feel jealous.

2303
02:15:11,070 --> 02:15:12,879
With flowers.
- Make the wedding dais.

2304
02:15:13,072 --> 02:15:14,881
Make them have bath.. - In milk.

2305
02:15:15,040 --> 02:15:19,182
She's calling me from her heart.

2306
02:15:19,345 --> 02:15:22,952
Dance with joy.

2307
02:15:23,115 --> 02:15:26,358
Dance with joy.

2308
02:15:39,098 --> 02:15:40,099
Darn it!

2309
02:15:40,299 --> 02:15:44,042
Dance with joy.

2310
02:15:44,236 --> 02:15:47,513
Dance with joy.

2311
02:16:28,314 --> 02:16:31,193
Narsimha,
they said that you were in coma.

2312
02:16:31,350 --> 02:16:32,556
When did you come
back to your senses?

2313
02:16:32,718 --> 02:16:34,356
Sir, I had to tell you something.

2314
02:16:35,788 --> 02:16:36,960
Hey!

2315
02:16:40,326 --> 02:16:42,897
He was the one who abducted
Pooja from the wedding hall.

2316
02:16:44,163 --> 02:16:45,233
Come here..

2317
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:49,911
Is he telling the truth?

2318
02:16:51,170 --> 02:16:53,377
You told me to tell everyone
like that, isn't it?

2319
02:16:53,573 --> 02:16:55,416
Hey, don't pretend.

2320
02:16:55,574 --> 02:16:58,487
Hello brother, just a minute.
I am coming.

2321
02:16:58,611 --> 02:17:00,318
Come here.
I was waiting for you. - Coming.

2322
02:17:00,479 --> 02:17:01,321
Relax. Relax.

2323
02:17:01,480 --> 02:17:03,289
He abducted Pooja, isn't it?

2324
02:17:04,550 --> 02:17:06,860
Yes. Correct, it is him.

2325
02:17:08,654 --> 02:17:11,191
Sir, didn't I say as you told me to?

2326
02:17:11,757 --> 02:17:13,794
Oh, that way..

2327
02:17:15,394 --> 02:17:17,897
I am following all your instructions,
isn't it? - Yes.

2328
02:17:18,063 --> 02:17:18,905
Follow? - Yes.

2329
02:17:19,098 --> 02:17:20,577
What following?
Even you're playing a charade.

2330
02:17:20,733 --> 02:17:23,043
Narsimha, let go off him!
Let go off him!

2331
02:17:24,169 --> 02:17:25,273
What's the matter, sir?

2332
02:17:25,471 --> 02:17:29,283
He was injured on head.
So, he's acting weird.

2333
02:17:29,475 --> 02:17:31,580
No sir, you don't know the truth.

2334
02:17:31,744 --> 02:17:35,317
He.. - You were in coma. How
would you know what's going on here?

2335
02:17:35,481 --> 02:17:38,462
I am fine, but still I cant
understand what's happening here.

2336
02:17:38,651 --> 02:17:42,656
I'll kill you.
- Narsimha, go from here. Go!

2337
02:17:44,390 --> 02:17:45,596
You have a seat.

2338
02:17:51,063 --> 02:17:53,737
Wherever you live..
wherever you're..

2339
02:17:53,932 --> 02:17:56,572
Happy sir.
Happy sir.. - Stay happy.

2340
02:17:56,736 --> 02:17:57,680
One minute.

2341
02:17:57,870 --> 02:17:59,975
You helped us by giving
us a lift that day.

2342
02:18:00,172 --> 02:18:01,947
But you've done a favor
on me by giving me a new life.

2343
02:18:02,107 --> 02:18:03,381
Thank you. Thank you very much.

2344
02:18:03,576 --> 02:18:08,047
Your whole family is taking
so much risk for your love.

2345
02:18:08,247 --> 02:18:09,590
I liked that commitment very much.

2346
02:18:09,748 --> 02:18:12,354
This Happy wants
everyone to be happy.

2347
02:18:12,518 --> 02:18:15,055
Okay. All the best.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

2348
02:18:15,254 --> 02:18:17,564
Yes. Yes, coming. Commitment.

2349
02:18:18,290 --> 02:18:22,295
Relative.. we are enjoying
daily since you've come here.

2350
02:18:23,028 --> 02:18:30,469
To tell you the truth.. we agreed
to this alliance as you're very rich.

2351
02:18:30,736 --> 02:18:36,152
But seeing this happiness,
we feel we don't want property.

2352
02:18:36,308 --> 02:18:39,721
Brother, just stay quiet.

2353
02:18:41,513 --> 02:18:43,015
Relative, come on let's have food.

2354
02:18:43,182 --> 02:18:44,354
One minute.

2355
02:18:46,985 --> 02:18:48,828
Hello? - Did you have your dinner?

2356
02:18:48,987 --> 02:18:51,627
Not yet. - You're already
suffering from acidity.

2357
02:18:51,824 --> 02:18:53,861
No. No.. First go and have food.

2358
02:18:54,693 --> 02:18:56,832
Alright. - One minute.

2359
02:18:57,463 --> 02:18:58,533
I love you.

2360
02:18:59,532 --> 02:19:00,909
Okay, me too.

2361
02:19:01,166 --> 02:19:07,117
Did you see that? Our relative
is calling his wife and..

2362
02:19:07,306 --> 02:19:10,253
...are asking her
if she had her dinner.

2363
02:19:10,909 --> 02:19:14,356
But in our house..
no matter how late we eat..

2364
02:19:14,547 --> 02:19:16,686
...they should have
food after we are done.

2365
02:19:16,849 --> 02:19:19,329
Relative, it is very wrong. - Why?

2366
02:19:19,485 --> 02:19:22,261
Women have a very small world.

2367
02:19:22,488 --> 02:19:24,058
Husband, house, and children.

2368
02:19:24,256 --> 02:19:28,432
As husbands it is our
duty to talk to them lovingly.

2369
02:19:28,594 --> 02:19:29,902
Come on, let's go and have food.

2370
02:19:30,062 --> 02:19:34,238
Wait here..
please, stay here. - What happened?

2371
02:19:36,969 --> 02:19:37,970
Go and come.

2372
02:19:38,170 --> 02:19:40,275
Your husband's call. - My husband?

2373
02:19:40,472 --> 02:19:41,917
Why did he call me?

2374
02:19:42,107 --> 02:19:46,078
Did you have your food? - Not yet.

2375
02:19:46,278 --> 02:19:48,417
Why didn't you have food till now?

2376
02:19:48,581 --> 02:19:50,390
You're already
suffering from acimity..

2377
02:19:50,549 --> 02:19:54,964
Acimity? What does it mean?
- You don't know anything.

2378
02:19:57,222 --> 02:20:00,795
Okay" I love you.

2379
02:20:00,959 --> 02:20:02,165
I love you?

2380
02:20:02,327 --> 02:20:04,034
Tell him, me too.

2381
02:20:04,696 --> 02:20:07,006
I love you.. - Mitto.

2382
02:20:07,199 --> 02:20:11,045
Mitto, mitto..
- What are you doing here?

2383
02:20:11,536 --> 02:20:15,450
Brother, nothing.
You came here to pee?

2384
02:20:15,607 --> 02:20:18,588
Yes, even I came to pee.
- Go. Go peacefully.

2385
02:20:18,743 --> 02:20:21,280
Okay. You go.

2386
02:20:25,417 --> 02:20:27,192
He's very smart.

2387
02:20:30,923 --> 02:20:32,527
Hello? - Hello.

2388
02:20:33,225 --> 02:20:34,704
Tell me, father-in-law?

2389
02:20:36,261 --> 02:20:37,672
Hand over the phone
to your mother-in-law.

2390
02:20:37,830 --> 02:20:38,808
Okay. I'll give it to her.

2391
02:20:38,964 --> 02:20:41,672
Hello. Dear, did you have food?

2392
02:20:42,034 --> 02:20:42,944
Not yet.

2393
02:20:43,101 --> 02:20:46,105
Eat soon or you'll get editity..

2394
02:20:46,271 --> 02:20:47,272
Okay, I will eat now.

2395
02:20:47,439 --> 02:20:48,918
Wait. Don't hang up the phone.

2396
02:20:51,076 --> 02:20:52,111
I love you.

2397
02:20:53,646 --> 02:20:55,387
Come on, you tell him too.

2398
02:20:55,547 --> 02:20:57,026
No, I won't say.

2399
02:20:58,784 --> 02:21:00,286
I love you.

2400
02:21:04,323 --> 02:21:06,030
She's a villager,
I am expecting too much from her.

2401
02:21:06,191 --> 02:21:08,728
You didn't realize it till today.
What will you realize now?

2402
02:21:13,265 --> 02:21:15,506
Enough, aunt. - One morsel more.

2403
02:21:15,701 --> 02:21:17,271
Hi aunt. - Open your mouth.

2404
02:21:17,469 --> 02:21:19,073
What's this? Why did you come here?

2405
02:21:19,271 --> 02:21:22,548
Nothing special, aunt. My aunt
has given this necklace for Pooja.

2406
02:21:22,741 --> 02:21:24,414
She should wear this and
sit on the wedding dais. - Okay.

2407
02:21:24,576 --> 02:21:25,987
Why did you come to give this?

2408
02:21:26,177 --> 02:21:27,622
You could've given
it to someone else.

2409
02:21:27,780 --> 02:21:29,487
He needs a chance to come here.

2410
02:21:31,483 --> 02:21:36,228
'Hey Partha..' - Tell me aunt.

2411
02:21:36,388 --> 02:21:38,061
Did you give the necklace?
- Yes, I did.

2412
02:21:38,223 --> 02:21:40,726
Okay. Come soon,
we have to make you have bath.

2413
02:21:40,892 --> 02:21:42,166
Okay, aunt.

2414
02:21:42,327 --> 02:21:44,273
Raam, do you know
which wedding hall it is?

2415
02:21:44,463 --> 02:21:46,773
It is the same where
he abducted Pooja.

2416
02:21:46,932 --> 02:21:49,276
I hope you didn't forget.
- How can I forget that place?

2417
02:21:49,468 --> 02:21:52,449
I was happy in my life,
but my problems started from there.

2418
02:21:55,640 --> 02:21:57,517
Hello. - Father!

2419
02:21:58,209 --> 02:22:00,280
<i>Mesa (cheat). We've been cheated.</i>

2420
02:22:00,479 --> 02:22:02,220
What? Mamsa?(mutton)

2421
02:22:02,414 --> 02:22:05,054
Who'll cook mutton in a wedding?

2422
02:22:05,217 --> 02:22:06,218
Father, you are not getting me.

2423
02:22:06,418 --> 02:22:08,955
It is not Chicago Chandrashekhar
or Dollars Dinesh.

2424
02:22:09,121 --> 02:22:10,828
How can they all be there?

2425
02:22:10,989 --> 02:22:12,127
They are dancing with us.

2426
02:22:12,324 --> 02:22:13,530
Father, you are not getting me.

2427
02:22:17,028 --> 02:22:19,508
Hey, how dare you
cheat us in our village?

2428
02:22:19,664 --> 02:22:21,905
Even I'll see how
you'll go out from here.

2429
02:22:22,067 --> 02:22:24,240
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

2430
02:22:24,703 --> 02:22:26,273
Aunt, you go to the
wedding hall with Pooja.

2431
02:22:26,471 --> 02:22:27,745
I'll join you there.

2432
02:22:46,891 --> 02:22:47,926
Narsimha!

2433
02:22:58,236 --> 02:23:01,240
You go to the wedding
hall and reveal this.

2434
02:23:01,439 --> 02:23:02,747
I'll handle him.

2435
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:30,178
Raam didn't return till now.

2436
02:23:30,335 --> 02:23:32,144
Raam didn't come?
- Shut up. - Shut up.

2437
02:23:32,304 --> 02:23:33,715
I am getting scared.

2438
02:23:33,872 --> 02:23:35,180
Nothing will happen to him.
You be courageous.

2439
02:23:35,374 --> 02:23:36,717
He'll surely come. You go. - Okay.

2440
02:24:11,977 --> 02:24:14,048
Brother.. the groom hasn't come yet.

2441
02:24:14,212 --> 02:24:15,816
I think they've known our drama.

2442
02:24:16,014 --> 02:24:18,585
Why are you getting tensed? Shut up.

2443
02:24:55,854 --> 02:24:57,561
Relative..
you seem to be very tensed.

2444
02:24:57,722 --> 02:25:00,532
Nothing..
the auspicious time is passing by..

2445
02:25:00,692 --> 02:25:02,296
...and the groom hasn't come yet.

2446
02:25:02,494 --> 02:25:03,837
The groom? - Yes.

2447
02:25:04,229 --> 02:25:05,572
See there.

2448
02:25:14,439 --> 02:25:15,941
Play the clarions. Play it.

2449
02:25:33,191 --> 02:25:37,936
Brother.. don't you think
our Pooja looks like our sister.

2450
02:25:38,129 --> 02:25:39,437
Yes, dear.

2451
02:25:39,765 --> 02:25:43,907
Listening to someone,
we've got her married to someone.

2452
02:25:44,069 --> 02:25:46,515
Don't know what he has and what not.

2453
02:25:46,771 --> 02:25:49,581
Why are you worrying?
Even, we'll take care of her.

2454
02:25:49,774 --> 02:25:51,947
We don't lack in anything.
- Come. Come, dear.

2455
02:25:52,110 --> 02:25:53,088
Come.

2456
02:25:53,578 --> 02:25:55,649
Dear, you don't worry at all.

2457
02:25:55,847 --> 02:26:00,193
Tell us if Raam troubles you.
Just call us.

2458
02:26:00,351 --> 02:26:02,297
Uncle, you are so nice.

2459
02:26:02,954 --> 02:26:05,127
If I've hurt you.. - No, dear.

2460
02:26:05,290 --> 02:26:06,792
Don't think that dear.

2461
02:26:06,992 --> 02:26:11,065
You can't hurt us.
You are our daughter.

2462
02:26:11,229 --> 02:26:13,072
You are our daughter. Come.

2463
02:26:13,231 --> 02:26:14,574
Come, let's go.

2464
02:26:24,709 --> 02:26:26,450
Hey, close the gates!

2465
02:26:26,611 --> 02:26:29,023
I am going to teach
a lesson to everyone today.

2466
02:26:29,881 --> 02:26:31,554
You can't stay quiet.
You've done something again.

2467
02:26:31,750 --> 02:26:33,127
Hey, give way for me to go.

2468
02:26:34,352 --> 02:26:36,696
Hey Naga, wait a minute. Come here.

2469
02:26:37,488 --> 02:26:38,694
What is that?

2470
02:26:46,097 --> 02:26:48,703
Raam, is Naga telling the truth?

2471
02:26:49,768 --> 02:26:51,839
Yes. - Why did you do like this?

2472
02:26:52,704 --> 02:26:55,548
I didn't want to elope
with Pooja and marry her.

2473
02:26:55,707 --> 02:26:58,187
I always wished to marry
her and take her from here.

2474
02:26:58,377 --> 02:27:01,381
Because, everyone is
important to Pooja like me.

2475
02:27:01,579 --> 02:27:05,026
Her parents wished to get
her married with your blessings.

2476
02:27:05,249 --> 02:27:06,284
That's the reason, I did that.

2477
02:27:06,451 --> 02:27:08,727
Hey! Why are you
listening to him.. - Stop!

2478
02:27:08,887 --> 02:27:10,867
Stop. We are elders, we are talking.

2479
02:27:11,056 --> 02:27:15,027
Hey, what will you say?
What do you think of yourself?

2480
02:27:15,226 --> 02:27:19,971
Hey! Insolent! How dare
you hold my brother's collar?

2481
02:27:20,132 --> 02:27:21,975
I'll chop off your hand, you idiot.

2482
02:27:24,169 --> 02:27:25,170
We left the people who cheated us..

2483
02:27:25,336 --> 02:27:26,747
We are fighting amongst ourselves.
This is not good.

2484
02:27:26,938 --> 02:27:29,817
Hey.. he didn't cheat us. - Yes.

2485
02:27:30,008 --> 02:27:32,079
He made us human beings.
- Tell them more.

2486
02:27:32,243 --> 02:27:35,781
We never respected to
the words told by our wives.

2487
02:27:35,947 --> 02:27:38,359
But by respecting
the words of the bride..

2488
02:27:38,550 --> 02:27:40,086
...this guy did so many things..

2489
02:27:40,252 --> 02:27:42,323
...see the family members with him.

2490
02:27:42,520 --> 02:27:44,500
Just see how good people they are.

2491
02:27:44,656 --> 02:27:45,999
Badra, you are right.

2492
02:27:46,191 --> 02:27:49,604
Our Pooja is getting
married in such good house.

2493
02:27:49,794 --> 02:27:51,796
We must be very fortunate.

2494
02:27:51,963 --> 02:27:54,102
What do you say Chikmalla.
- You are right.

2495
02:27:54,266 --> 02:27:56,974
Even we cheated you by
getting along with these kids.

2496
02:27:57,168 --> 02:27:57,976
Please, forgive us.

2497
02:27:58,136 --> 02:27:59,638
Don't say that.

2498
02:27:59,804 --> 02:28:01,181
We changed because of you.

2499
02:28:01,372 --> 02:28:03,716
We changed our style
as well as our hearts.

2500
02:28:03,875 --> 02:28:06,151
What say? - To tell you the truth..

2501
02:28:06,311 --> 02:28:09,485
...we are feeling very bad
that you all are leaving. - Yes.

2502
02:28:09,648 --> 02:28:12,492
So, we all will come and
stay in your house for four days.

2503
02:28:12,651 --> 02:28:15,632
Not only four days,
stay in our house for a month.

2504
02:28:15,787 --> 02:28:19,166
What do you say? - I can't
say anything, ask my brother-in-law.

2505
02:28:20,225 --> 02:28:22,034
New song and music.

2506
02:28:25,497 --> 02:28:27,738
The old love story.

2507
02:28:30,969 --> 02:28:34,610
You are very slow.
The world is very fast.

2508
02:28:34,773 --> 02:28:37,413
Be careful when with me.

2509
02:28:37,742 --> 02:28:40,450
New song and music.
