1
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,100
(Old Tamil song plays on bus)

2
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,920
The glass-like moon

3
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,900
Dances before me

4
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,890
Feels like sparklers bursting in my 
mind

5
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,960
College days come fluttering...

6
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,130
...before my eyes

7
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,900
And my hands and feet feel 
like I am intoxicated

8
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,780
When I see flowers in bloom

9
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,870
Its like my heart is dancing

10
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,230
And the fragrance of the blooms

11
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,880
Feels like a medley of sandalwood 
within

12
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,910
When the angels approach

13
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,080
The clouds flow like rivers

14
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,280
The paintings of the Gods

15
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,310
Turn into our paths here

16
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,460
The glass-like moon

17
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,110
Dances before me

18
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:59,360
Feels like sparklers bursting in my 
mind

19
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,660
- Hey! It's your Dad! - What? 
- Your Dad!

20
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,770
Hey! Move!

21
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,050
- Open! - Huh?

22
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,710
- I don't want it, son... you have it! 
- It's not for you!

23
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,300
- It's for my little sister 
- So you have decided it's a girl?

24
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,350
I wish it would be a girl, Mom

25
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,290
- Ok then... here goes! 
- Here you go!

26
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,590
I guess Dad will love this one, right 
Mom...?

27
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,050
Since this is his own...?

28
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,500
Here comes Dad

29
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:15,340
- What was he saying? 
- That he would like the baby to be a girl

30
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,130
So you would like it to be a girl?

31
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,860
She will grow and study and need to be 
married off someday

32
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,180
Do you have the money for all that?

33
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,430
Eat whatever's given to you and 
get lost!

34
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,060
Cursed creature!

35
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,940
Why do I bother talking to you?

36
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,160
God didn't hear my prayers anyway

37
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:49,430
My darling, to me...

38
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:53,400
...you are the celebration within me

39
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,410
And here you are, feeding me...

40
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,060
...with your silent love

41
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,980
When a waterlily offers its smile

42
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,770
All pain disappears

43
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:21,140
And upon the words you utter, tender...

44
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,640
...my heart takes flight

45
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,460
Come along with me and sing

46
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,820
Hey! You are getting a little baby!

47
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,120
Your mother's being taken to hospital. 
Go quick!

48
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,780
- Don't cry, my love, don't cry! 
- What's the point in crying like this?

49
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,020
- Stop crying! - How will we give treatment 
if you do this - Let the doctor take a look

50
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,180
-It will be ok - Let the doctor take a look

51
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,490
- Blood...there is blood all over her... 
- It'll be ok...don't cry, dear...

52
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,000
- She is all I have! 
- Be brave!

53
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,930
Tell the doctor to save her...

54
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,690
Tell the doctor to save her...if you say, 
they will listen

55
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,460
You...you are my friend...

56
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,920
Tell them to take care of her...see, 
they are taking her away!

57
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,810
They are taking her away!

58
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,020
They are taking her in...see....

59
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,520
Look...look...

60
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:04,490
Oh no! Oh no! She's gone?

61
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,250
No! No, stop! Listen to me!

62
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,870
Don't! Come on!

63
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,550
It's a girl...here...hold her

64
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,720
Take good care of her

65
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,620
Good baby! Don't cry! Don't cry!

66
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:21,030
Don't cry! Look here! Look at me!

67
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,190
Hey! Didn't I tell you? What are you doing?

68
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,780
- Put it to sleep! 
- Don't cry! Don't cry!

69
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,990
- Can't I get some peace around here? 
- Don't cry...don't cry...

70
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,150
What a nuisance!

71
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,310
Drink, baby!

72
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,830
Go on! Drink! It's milk!

73
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,900
Drink, little one! Drink!

74
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,630
Don't cry, little one!

75
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,630
(Humming a lullaby)

76
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,570
Don't cry, alright? Sweet little thing!

77
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,550
Peeli!

78
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,670
Honey!

79
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,970
(reciting lesson from book)

80
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,620
Stop...stop...

81
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,100
- I'll be back tomorrow, ok? 
- Ok

82
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:01,170
What, old woman? Done teaching for the day?

83
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,850
Just you wait! I'll show you who I am 
someday

84
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,060
- I'll see you in the morning 
- Hey! Hey hey hey!

85
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,330
Come here! Come on and sit down

86
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,450
- What is it? 
- Where are you going?

87
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:19,080
- Have dinner before you go. Do you 
like fish curry? - Yes

88
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,440
Sit, sit... hey you!

89
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,570
Where are you going?

90
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,750
Peeli, my child... come!

91
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,350
It's your Dad calling... come to me!

92
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:41,140
Are you going to be a Doctor with all 
this studying?

93
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,020
Then what are you studying for?

94
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,530
What's all this, man?

95
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,880
Come, child... go on inside

96
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,730
Don't be scared, ok? Take her inside, son

97
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,650
- Hey, hey! 
- I'll see you in the morning

98
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,750
But...hey! You're my friend, aren't you? 
Why are you leaving me?

99
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,250
Hey! Who's there?

100
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,590
(Drunken mumbling)

101
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,360
Peeli, honey...

102
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,910
Peeli...!

103
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,490
- (muffled) Etta*! -Huh! 
(*Big brother)

104
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,610
Hey! Leave her!

105
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,220
Let her go! Brother, let her go!

106
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,280
- Peeli! Honey! 
- Go away, boy!

107
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,700
Hey! What's all this noise?

108
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,530
Can't a man sleep in peace?

109
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,170
- That man... our Peeli...! 
- Hey!

110
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,960
Get lost! He is my friend!

111
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,500
- It's just my friend - But he... our 
Peeli... - Get out!

112
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,940
- Dad! 
- Shh!

113
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,350
I'll kill you! Get out!

114
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
I'll cut you to bits! Get lost!

115
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,590
He gives whatever I ask for. So shouldn't 
I give him what he asks?

116
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
Isn't that what friends do? Huh?

117
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,970
Stay still, girl!

118
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,280
Gopal...

119
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,740
Oh no! What happened?

120
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,850
You may call the bride

121
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,820
Now you may call the groom

122
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,020
- Where did he go? 
- He was standing right there - Hey!

123
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,700
- Where's he? 
- I don't know

124
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,210
- What? Isn't there a groom? 
- Make way, please!

125
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,970
- Was he here at all? 
- Make way...move aside, please!

126
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,260
- Has the groom arrived? 
- Who's to arrive?

127
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,090
There's no one left to arrive. Start 
the ceremony, Father

128
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,640
- Hey, Joy! - Yes? - Where is this bride's 
groom?

129
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:44,570
He isn't here? He was right here!

130
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,550
Don't worry! He will come soon

131
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,740
Father... give me a minute, please... 
Move, move!

132
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,810
He'll be right here, ok?

133
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,490
Is the room on fire? Huh?

134
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,500
Haven't you had enough of posing in the 
dark in that suit?

135
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,190
- You! 
- Huh?

136
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,140
What is it?

137
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,820
Stop your play-acting! There's big 
trouble going on out there

138
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,800
So? Does that mean I cannot get dressed?

139
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,290
Stop getting angry! Just laugh a bit!

140
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,240
Good Lord!

141
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,440
It's so long since I saw you so 
well-dressed and smiling!

142
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,090
- Come downstairs! Come on! 
- That I will

143
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,110
- Is George Sir ready yet? 
- Not a chance!

144
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,480
He is going crazy because he can't get 
the knot right

145
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,860
So I poured him a couple of pegs

146
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,400
- Oh no! - Now I am just worried he will 
tie the bridal pendant on the Priest's neck

147
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,780
But how on earth did he find a bride 
at this age?

148
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,050
And here I've been trying for ages to 
find a bride and no luck!

149
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,070
For that, you need to have more than 
comedy in your blood

150
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,210
You need the look too... how do I look? 
Huh?

151
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,330
You're just going to serve food, right? 
You look great for that!

152
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,650
Fool!

153
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,810
- Come - Who do you think you are? 
A movie star?

154
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,900
- Sir.. - Huh? - Stay at a gap from 
the Priest

155
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:44,420
If he smells alcohol, he will throw you 
and your bride out of the Church

156
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,830
To smell him, the Priest would need a 
ladder!

157
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:50,230
- The Priest is so short! 
- Look who is talking!

158
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:53,020
- Please... move aside - There he is! 
- Move, move

159
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,630
Come here!

160
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,850
- Go on, Sir! 
- Come here!

161
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,680
Go!

162
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,350
- Glory be to Jesus Christ 
- So be it! So be it!

163
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:09,690
Oh no! The Priest is standing on the steps! 
It's smelling of trouble!

164
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,070
Could you... please...?

165
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,090
Ok...ok...

166
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,620
Come!

167
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:25,420
- Come on - The Priest let them in 
- Thank God!

168
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,620
- Hey Ronnie! Come on! This will go on 
without us - Come!

169
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,550
- Come - Listen... last week, during an 
event here...

170
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,130
...some college kids gatecrashed and ate 
up all the food

171
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,130
Keep an eye out for them! If there is no 
food at the reception, they will eat me up!

172
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,940
Ladies and Gentlemen! Here they are - the 
King and Queen of the day...

173
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,920
...George Thomas and Susan!

174
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:48,620
They are going to start their life together 
by sharing a piece of cake

175
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,410
Give a big round of applause...

176
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,990
...and let them have your blessings 
for this big moment!

177
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,000
You will fall off the bed and break your 
back on your wedding night...

178
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,180
Just wait and watch! 
(guests talk in background)

179
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:03,830
Don't be so depressed! The girl we are 
going to meet in Njarakkal...

180
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:07,190
- ...is going to be The One for you 
- I hope so

181
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,030
Chicken fry...

182
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:25,080
- Chicken fry... - A minute, please... 
could you give me some plain rice?

183
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
- That's at the opposite counter, Madam 
- Is it?

184
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,410
- And vegetable curry? 
- That too

185
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,590
- There? He says it's over there. Let's go 
- ok

186
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,980
- Chicken alert! - What? 
- Give some chicken there!

187
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,090
Oh yes! Chicken fry!

188
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,150
- Want some chocolate? 
- No. You can have it

189
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,170
I really like chocolates

190
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,070
- Then eat! 
- ok!

191
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,190
- Here! Have a drink! 
- ok

192
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,010
- Want this? - No... please drink... 
go ahead! - Ok

193
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,840
- Time for a refill? - I'll let you know 
- Ok. - And don't leave!

194
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,210
Come here

195
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,860
- What's it, Sir? - Ronnie, sit here 
for a few minutes!

196
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,710
- I need to have a drink 
- Ok. Wait! What?

197
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,410
Where are you off to? You can't drink 
now! You can drink later!

198
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,770
- Sit there, Sir! Come on! 
- But... Ronnie?

199
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,610
Look here! Try a bit of this!

200
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,830
- I don't want to 
- Try it! Go on!

201
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,390
- Huh? 
- It's vodka!

202
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,220
This won't leave a smell!

203
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,060
How much do these girls eat? This is 
the 4th plate!

204
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,660
Give me some more chicken! Isn't this 
meant to be served?

205
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,770
Put two more pieces in here

206
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,830
And in this one too... get all you 
need, ok?

207
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,020
- What the hell! 
- What are you looking at? Serve!

208
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,430
One for me too

209
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,560
My dear Sally! He calls me all the time 
from America

210
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,390
But I can't just drop everything here and 
go to him

211
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,540
- Of course not! - What about the acres 
and acres of Rubber trees?

212
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:06,400
And I get so tired just keeping track of 
the yield!

213
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,600
- I bet! - Hello Madam! 
- Hello!

214
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,640
- How was the food? - It was good 
- Come on!

215
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,750
Any suggestions?

216
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:16,110
If you ask me... I feel the ice cream need 
not be so cold

217
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,560
Oh! Very good suggestion!

218
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,630
You should try our special raspberry 
ice cream

219
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,990
We serve it only to special guests! I am 
sure you'll like it

220
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,450
Oh! Then you need to give me one!

221
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,240
Of course! That... must be your daughter

222
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,300
She looks just like you

223
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,320
(girls talking in background) 
Really? Does she?

224
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,800
- She looks like me, doesn't she? - Yes! 
- But she is not from our side

225
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,630
- The she must be related to the groom 
- The groom? You mean that old man?

226
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,260
He has no family. And one relative that 
he has, was not invited

227
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,350
- Alright then 
- My ice cream?

228
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,270
We've put it in the sun to warm. 
I'll send one to you soon

229
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:02,860
- How was the food? 
- It was a nice... disaster!

230
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,050
- Oh! - Is that why you were 
stuffing yourelf?

231
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,060
- Huh? What the f...? 
- No, no no no!

232
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,080
Don't underestimate the catering 
people, ok?

233
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,230
- What? Fruit salad with ice cream? 
- That's the way to have it! - You...!

234
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,070
Why don't you speak? Got a bone 
of mutton stuck in your throat?

235
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,120
Did you take us for fools?

236
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,530
I may have the looks... but at heart 
I am damn cheap

237
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,580
I got that

238
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:28,060
- Look at her! I feel like giving her 
one... - Hey! Hey! Hey!

239
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,850
- What's the problem? 
- The college had a holiday today

240
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:34,670
Was this your dad's second wedding that you 
could just eat to your heart's content?

241
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,900
- Yes, it was. 
- That's what I...wait...what?

242
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,960
- What? 
- It was my Dad's second wedding

243
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,530
- Oh no! 
- This is George Sir's daughter

244
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,550
Say you are sorry!

245
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,890
Can I get you a fruit salad with ice 
cream, Madam?

246
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,920
Does that sound like sorry?

247
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,070
Sorry, my child... he didn't know who you 
were!

248
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,110
- You can have whatever you want 
- Yes

249
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,140
A chair for you?

250
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,880
Hope you won't... tell your Dad!

251
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,960
I think the AC's not working

252
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:07,590
- Are you guys trying to ruin me? 
- What's left to ruin?

253
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,220
There comes a bus!

254
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,070
- What are you up to, buddy? 
- Nothing at all, buddy!

255
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,150
Nothing? Then who are these? 
Your daddy and mummy?

256
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,170
They are here to see Fort Kochi

257
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,030
- Oh! 
- I was just helping...

258
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,730
No help needed, ok? Things will 
get dark for you if you do it again

259
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,810
- Now scoot! 
- Do you even have a license?

260
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,610
I truly, don't!

261
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,270
How many times have you been warned 
not to do this without a license?

262
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,180
- Don't touch me! 
- And what will you do if we do?

263
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,370
Beat him up! Come on!

264
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,700
You dare head out in your vehicle 
again...

265
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,810
- ...we will kill you! 
- Fight me one on one! Come on!

266
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:23,380
Those were Chanchi's boys... they have 
been like this for a while now

267
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:26,340
Like everyone here has a licence to 
be tourist guides!

268
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,550
Why do they do this only when they see our 
vehicle?

269
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:32,970
Don't get worked up about it... those are 
druggies just looking for trouble

270
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,350
- Why did you head out with the vehicle 
anyway? - That...(mumbling)...

271
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:40,250
- What? - (mumbling) 
- Just eat

272
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,810
I asked him to go. Sabu is on leave 
for his Dad's surgery

273
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,850
I figured the vehicle is just lying idle

274
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,040
So why not get what we can with it?

275
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,360
Now you see what you can get!

276
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,360
If they had broken the car glass as well...

277
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,270
...things would have been even better!

278
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:56,370
Does it hurt? 
(Burps)

279
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,380
Chewing this biryani has helped me get 
over the pain on this side

280
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,470
Some more would help with the pain on 
the other side

281
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,680
Could I have one more? Mutton or 
chicken - either will do

282
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,930
Josekutty - get him one more biryani

283
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,020
- Hmmm 
- Go get it!

284
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,150
She's been making good progress 
of late

285
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,740
For a change to happen this soon...

286
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,790
...it has to be God's Grace

287
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,470
- Have some more of this, child.. 
- No

288
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:40,840
Just a little more... don't make me mad!

289
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,580
What's wrong, Grandma?

290
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,600
She refuses to take the medicine

291
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,630
How would she when you are giving it?

292
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,650
- Alright, then why don't you do it? 
- I will...give it here!

293
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,960
Move... sweetheart...

294
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,560
- Be a good girl and have this! 
- I don't want to, Icha* (*Big Brother)

295
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,230
Don't say that! Do it for Icha!

296
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,010
You know what the Doctor just said?

297
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,520
That if you take your medicines like a good 
girl...

298
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,200
...in just a few days...

299
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,740
...we'll be able to go home!

300
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,190
There! Lie down!

301
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,400
The Policemen were here again today

302
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,470
They asked her some questions and left

303
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,700
Hey! What is it?

304
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,330
Who are you looking for, huh?

305
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,500
What is it? There's no one here!

306
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:59,060
What are you looking for? There's 
no one here

307
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,770
- Oh no! 
- No! Don't! Please!

308
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,880
Please!

309
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,040
- I am sorry! 
- You...!

310
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,250
Please!

311
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,270
Don't!

312
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,490
Sorry!

313
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,430
Please forgive me!

314
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,890
This is the first time I have done 
something like this

315
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,320
And it will be the last...I...

316
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,950
...will do anything you ask...

317
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,450
Please forgive me!

318
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,120
Get up and leave!

319
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:50,050
We can ask for maybe 25, right?

320
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,210
Next month is his daughter's wedding

321
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,770
Then let us make it 50

322
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:28,070
We, as humans are today erasing the 
experiences of the past

323
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,230
The future is all about hope

324
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,660
- He knows so much stuff, doesn't he? 
- Ya...

325
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,630
- That's the good thing about being rich 
- Hmm

326
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,180
Rich people are all educated and well-read

327
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,230
They know everything about everything

328
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,400
And have high standards too

329
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,440
We are just...useless

330
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:46,270
Now look at that one! Who does he think 
he is?

331
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,300
You'd think he is the next speaker

332
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,630
- Hey! All ready? 
- Of course!

333
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:54,560
You could've come when it was all over

334
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,600
It took a while for me to get this ironed

335
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:59,810
- Who do you think you are? James Bond? 
- Evening drink's on me!

336
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:03,060
- Ok then. - Ronnie? - Yes? 
- Everything's ready?

337
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,450
Of course, Sir! I came in early to see 
that all was set

338
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:08,310
- Very good! And also... 
- Yes?

339
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:10,330
After the guest speeches is the 
thanksgiving speech

340
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:12,170
After that is the musical programme

341
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,230
Start serving food as soon as it starts

342
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:17,110
- But what about the musical programme? 
- That will carry on

343
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:20,290
What is important to us is not that - 
it is this!

344
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,450
- Correct! - And also, please serve some 
finger food in the room above

345
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,560
- OK? 
- Ok

346
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,010
- Could you... - Yes? - ...serve the finger 
food? - Try again?

347
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,100
- I mean... I will take it 
- Ok

348
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,710
This is what these rich men do

349
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,290
They'll be eating their chicken and mutton 
before the poor singers

350
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
Not a thought for the poor starving 
singers!

351
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,210
Imagine them going into a high note...

352
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:44,110
...and their mouths will water and the 
water goes into their heads...

353
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,150
...and then they die! Think about it!

354
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:57,520
- The food's good! - Please have some 
more, Madam

355
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,690
- The ladies have good appetites! 
- Hello! Please stop!

356
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:04,560
Do I need a Minister's recommendation 
to eat this food?

357
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:31,160
That day...in Church...we made a mistake 
because we didn't know who you were

358
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:35,080
Yes...looking at George Sir, you wouldn't 
say he has such a beautiful daughter

359
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,090
- Yes, yes! - You look really great! 
- Don't overdo it!

360
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,520
Please don't make an issue of what 
happened that day

361
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:45,540
He is someone who regularly gives 
us business

362
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,940
- Yes 
- Hmm...let me think about it

363
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:50,330
- Ok - Would you have 5000 Rupees 
on you?

364
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,470
- What? 
- Do you have 5000 rupees?

365
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,340
I...don't really...

366
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,620
Would you...?

367
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,540
He left

368
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,550
I don't have...so much cash on me

369
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,700
Got a mobile?

370
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:15,540
- This is just a...China-make...not worth 
much... - Give it to me

371
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,650
Here...this is my number...call me 
when you have the cash

372
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,730
We can think about your business 
contracts then, ok?

373
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,960
Next item...our President and his wife 
will perform...

374
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,040
...an awesome action song!

375
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,600
That will be worth a laugh! Come on!

376
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,790
I bet it's funny! Come on!

377
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,680
Everyone's...shall I...?

378
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:50,010
May I...leave?

379
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,090
- Go on 
- Ok

380
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:02,180
(sings) Snakes have their holes...

381
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,290
...the birds have the sky...

382
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:10,380
Only the son of Man has...

383
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,060
...no place on Earth to lay his head...

384
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,280
...no place on Earth to lay his head...

385
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,370
Disgusting!

386
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,860
God had none left...or he would have 
given them some

387
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,960
- What? 
- Shame!

388
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,070
And now I have lost all respect for 
rich people!

389
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,410
(on Tv) ' I ask you friends...'

390
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,640
'...what became of Punnapra-Vayalar...'

391
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:37,600
'...what of the green carpets spread over 
the hills...'

392
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,340
(Song playing on TV)

393
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:52,650
The actress Malayalis lovingly called 
'big sister' for the first time ever

394
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:55,610
My own dear Sunny Chechi* 
(*Big Sister)

395
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,090
- Hey! Where is Munna? 
- They've all gone for a late night movie

396
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,440
Oh no! We had a guest coming in at 
night

397
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,450
He needs to be picked up and taken to 
his room

398
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,630
Sabu used to be his regular driver

399
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:15,380
What can we do now? All our other cars 
are out on runs

400
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:24,890
- Listen! - Yes? - Why didn't you go 
for the movie, my dear?

401
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,380
I wasn't feeling too good

402
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,470
Could you go and pick him up, my dear?

403
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,590
It will be more satisfying than this. What 
do you say?

404
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,640
I should have guessed from all that love

405
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,180
I am not going out just to get beaten up 
on the road

406
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,660
- Huh? 
- Besides, look at Chechi here

407
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,400
Those guys won't be around at night. They 
will be knocked out of their senses by then

408
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:47,400
- I can't! 
- But it is nothing, my dear!

409
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,730
You pick him up and drop him to his hotel 
room

410
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,020
Just a half hour's work! That's all!

411
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,990
He's a regular guest...if we lose him, then 
he'll be gone forever

412
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:59,030
- Please go, my dear! - But... 
- Please just go!

413
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,100
- Ouch! My hand! 
- Please...just this once...

414
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:04,170
- Ok - Ok? 
- Yes, ok

415
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,530
- Chandy? 
- No

416
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,410
- Chandy? 
- Who Chandy?

417
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:04,280
- Brother? - Yes? 
- This is the last bus from Munnar? - Yes

418
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,390
What fool's task has Joychayan sent me 
on in the middle of the night?

419
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:19,220
What's this place? Are we at Vagamon?

420
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:22,370
Not there! I am over here!

421
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,310
Can't you hear me?

422
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,520
But that is the top of the bus

423
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,580
- Ernakulam? - Yes 
- Why have you brought me here?

424
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:45,150
I didn't bring you here....are you 
Mr. Chandy?

425
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:51,320
- Go and get the fire force 
- Ok

426
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,000
- Wait! Why? 
- Why? How do I get down?

427
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,560
- I'll come up 
- But how will you climb up here?

428
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:03,170
- Usually it is this way 
- There's a way to climb?

429
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,730
- Your bag... 
- Here...take it

430
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,120
Give that here

431
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,720
Wait! You should be really careful!

432
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,060
Very careful! There are breakable objects 
in there

433
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:19,080
- Which of these bags has them? 
- Which one? Hmm...

434
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,740
Give it here! Let me see

435
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,240
Huh! The bag!

436
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:27,000
- Did you hear anything break? - No 
- You didn't, right?

437
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,750
Then it must be this one!

438
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,960
Now get down

439
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:36,620
Get down! Careful! I am right 
behind you

440
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,800
- Want me to help? 
- No! No help

441
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,750
How on earth did you...

442
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,830
...climb up there?

443
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,820
That's what I was thinking too...

444
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:57,200
I...am...Ronnie...I was the one who just 
helped you down

445
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,540
To someone as drunk as me...

446
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,700
...you shouldn't ask quesions like...

447
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,770
...when, where and how

448
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,970
Sorry sir...I won't ask now on

449
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,640
You are Mr. Chandy, aren't you?

450
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,920
- I already told you I am 
- You are..yes, you are!

451
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:16,260
I need a place to stay

452
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:18,290
- That is fully arranged for you! 
- Where?

453
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,600
- With complimentary full-jar soda! 
- Thank you!

454
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:28,230
Do you usually travel on the roof 
of the bus?

455
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:32,020
Oh no...I went up to get my bags

456
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:34,000
I fell asleep there

457
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:39,350
- What is it, Sir? 
- What?

458
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,500
- Huh? 
- Oh...yes...

459
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,760
- One minute 
- Need help? - No

460
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:45,790
I can help myself

461
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:48,050
Be right back!

462
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,660
I am ok...ok...

463
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:14,510
- Shall we go? 
- Wait...wait!

464
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:23,630
It's the water in the body that goes out 
as urine

465
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,430
So we should always replace it as soon 
as we lose it

466
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:32,750
- Got it? - I see - Or else we will 
end up losing our liver

467
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:36,800
You drink?

468
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,790
Not regularly...

469
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:40,870
Then don't!

470
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,600
Pour!

471
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:50,210
Enough!...Hold it!

472
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,000
Hey you!

473
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:04,760
What's this?

474
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,680
You...you!

475
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,390
Who are they?

476
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,170
Hey! What are you upto?

477
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,920
Don't you guys ever understand?

478
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,990
That...it's...

479
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:32,140
- I can solve it for you 
- Sir!

480
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,170
- Don't! They are real trashy guys 
- It's ok

481
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:38,260
The Lord Jesus said we should love 
our neighbours like ourselves

482
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,740
So let's give some love and get 
some back

483
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,980
- But...sir... 
- Wait...

484
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:46,090
No! Don't...what's he up to?

485
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:49,390
This is not like you think

486
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,680
Just watch me

487
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,310
What's it, son?

488
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:58,410
What's your problem?

489
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:00,450
Oh no!

490
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
- Got all the love you wanted? 
- Yes

491
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,420
- Yes...nice and strong! 
- Alright. Then wait in the car

492
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:09,640
Nice trick the Lord played on me!

493
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,610
If you ever dare to drive out in this 
vehicle again...

494
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,430
...we'll burn both the car and you!

495
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:28,570
- Sir? - Yes? - Who was it who said, 
if they don't follow your path...

496
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:31,360
...chase them down their own path and beat 
the hell out of them?

497
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:33,470
Who said that?

498
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:36,530
Lucifer!

499
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:53,070
You go around at night..

500
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,100
...looking for stuff to burn?

501
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:59,290
Come on! Hey! Come on! Get the bikes!

502
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:02,090
Dont just leave! How will he burn all this 
on his own?

503
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:04,110
Go! Go!

504
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,080
If I said I'd burn you, I mean I will 
burn you!

505
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:27,280
Move!

506
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:30,770
Come on, guys!

507
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:36,020
Guys! He beat me up!

508
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:45,630
Hold on! Hold on a second!

509
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,850
It's been a while since I...

510
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:52,890
...got involved in this programme of 
beating up local goons

511
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,410
So I may be out of touch

512
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:00,230
Alright...now I remember

513
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,150
Come!

514
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,820
Finish him off!

515
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,700
Lord! That is awesome!

516
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,280
Look out, boys! It's the cops! 
Get away, quick!

517
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:54,850
Here come the cops! Let's see what 
you do now!

518
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:57,960
- Get the bikes! 
- Get on your bikes and go!

519
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:01,300
- Come on! Come on! 
- The Inspector was my classmate

520
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:05,900
- Sir, where are you going? 
- Vagamon is like my own hometown!

521
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,580
- But this is not Vagamon! 
- Watch!

522
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:10,710
Come on, Thomas! I have a full bottle 
on me! Let's finish it together!

523
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:23,430
Get in

524
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:26,620
No...no trouble

525
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,720
- I have talked to them 
- Sir! Sir - Stop it!

526
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:32,320
Ok, you can come over. I'll be here

527
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:35,070
- Sir! - Shut up! 
- Inky Pinky Ponky

528
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:38,410
Father had a donkey. Donkey 
died...

529
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:40,350
Father cried...Inky Pinky Ponky!

530
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:42,170
Turn it over! You have to turn!

531
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:46,480
- Ronnie! Come! It's more fun with three! 
- Thankappa! Come here

532
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,620
The Inspector wants to see you

533
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:50,650
When I am back, I'll teach you 
my favourite game

534
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,720
It's even more fun than this!

535
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:55,450
- Come - Why does the Inspector 
want to see me?

536
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,500
- He's bored of sitting there all alone 
- Really?

537
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,230
Oh no!

538
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:01,470
- Sir, sir! 
- What?

539
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,820
What is the Inspector like?

540
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:06,990
- What do you mean? 
- Will he accept a bribe?

541
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:09,470
- Will he? 
- That won't be easy

542
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:12,010
- Why so? 
- Last month someone tried to bribe him

543
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,810
He was just able to walk yesterday

544
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,320
- The Inspector broke his leg 
- Oh no!

545
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,190
- No! Please don't hit me! 
- Heard that?

546
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,630
- Do you want to try? 
- Not at all! We are happy here!

547
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,540
- It's quite comfortable here! - Good! 
- Sir! - What now?

548
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:27,270
- Are there mosquitos here? 
- A few

549
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:30,850
- If you want more, I can arrange for it 
- Funny! Funny!

550
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,180
You should try for one of those comedy 
shows on TV

551
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,140
- I should try, you think? - Please, no! 
We are quite alright here!

552
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:46,350
- Sir? 
- Ah yes, Joy!

553
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:49,380
I have talked to the Inspector. Just 
go in and meet him

554
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:56,070
- Joychan! - Huh? 
- Are you happy now?

555
00:50:57,270 --> 00:50:59,270
- Let me go and talk to him 
- Sure

556
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:03,000
- Which of these is Chandy? 
- The fool on the floor

557
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,430
- Is he letting us go? - Don't want to go? 
Get him and come!

558
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:12,800
Ok!

559
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,810
Sir! Wake up! We can go!

560
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:19,990
- Are we at Vagamon? - Vagamon 
indeed! Come on! - Leaving?

561
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,020
I'm letting them out on your account

562
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:25,110
- Make sure there is no more trouble 
- Leave me alone!

563
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:28,090
Are we at the hotel?

564
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:31,980
- Tip all these guards Rs. 100 each 
- Oh God!

565
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:34,150
Happy, everyone?

566
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:36,390
- Sorry, sir! 
- Alright...and listen...

567
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:38,960
Make sure he is safe somewhere. 
He shouldn't get in any trouble

568
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,020
I will take care of him! Come here, you!

569
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:01,180
Listen...will you get him inside?

570
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,360
I was inside all this time! Isn't that 
enough?

571
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,390
- You can take him yourself! - But 
how do I...? - Don't speak anymore!

572
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,510
- Are you sure this is not the Chandy you 
were talking about? - Yes!

573
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,830
That fool cancelled his trip

574
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:15,790
- Who is this then? 
- Some other fool!

575
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,380
- And you couldn't call to tell me? 
- I tried calling you

576
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:23,310
- I forgot my phone at home 
- Is that my fault?

577
00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:26,780
No! It was all my fault! I should have 
stayed back and watched Chechi dance

578
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:31,030
- What can we do now? 
- We have a room booked anyhow

579
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:34,020
You take him inside and take 
whatever he pays you

580
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:36,860
- I want nothing from him 
- Don't say that!

581
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,070
This was your inaugral ride. It will be 
bad luck to refuse!

582
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,240
You really want a fool's curse on you?

583
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,870
Do it...please!

584
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:52,620
- Sir? - Huh? 
- You! Sir! - What? What?

585
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:54,640
- Are we at Vagamon? 
- Yes!

586
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:56,730
- Wait, what? 
- Don't get worked up!

587
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:59,680
- I am losing it! 
- Finally, Vagamon!

588
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:01,920
- But this is not... 
- Ooh! So...cold!

589
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:03,940
- Sir! 
- Oh so cold...!

590
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:06,010
Cold!

591
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,480
Still sleeping?

592
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:14,250
Hey! Where is the bag you stole yesterday?

593
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,420
- In the fridge...heat it before you eat it 
- Ok

594
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:19,380
- Wait, what? 
- What did you ask?

595
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:22,280
- You asked about yesterday's fries, right? 
- No! The bag!

596
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:25,790
The bag you stole from the guest yesterday. 
Where is it?

597
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:28,230
Stole? Who?

598
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:31,700
Well, his bag is lost. And his valuables 
were in it

599
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,020
He has complained to the Police that you 
stole it

600
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,100
Joychayan has asked you to go 
down there

601
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:39,390
God! What a pest!

602
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:43,880
I swear I haven't taken it. He had three 
bags

603
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:46,670
And I put all three in his room before 
I left

604
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:50,210
Not three! There were four! You can take 
the money if you want

605
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:52,170
But I need the mobile, Sir. Please 
tell him to return it!

606
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:54,290
If that goes missing...I can't even...

607
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:58,590
When you got down the top of the bus, 
you had only three bags!

608
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,480
No! Not three! Four!

609
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:02,530
Hey! Wait, wait, wait!

610
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:05,670
- Where did you say he got down from? 
- Sir...last night...

611
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:07,970
...I got him from atop a bus

612
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:10,710
That's true. What is wrong with that?

613
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:14,080
- I like buses. 
- Sir? - Yes, come in

614
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,140
- Got it? - Yes 
- Thank you! Thank you!

615
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,480
- This is my bag 
- It was found on top of the bus

616
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,580
The conductor brought it here

617
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:24,650
Alright. Check if all your stuff is there

618
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,440
There! Found my mobile!

619
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:38,090
Look! PUBG game!

620
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:41,090
See?

621
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:43,550
- Are you a player? 
- Not at this, no

622
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:46,100
- No - You should! It's fantastic!

623
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:49,770
Did you see this?

624
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:52,130
It's past the Crown level

625
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:54,800
Imagine if tihs had been lost! Just think 
about it!

626
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:57,710
My Good Lord!

627
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,880
- Sir...can we leave? 
- Alright

628
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,240
Ronnie! Please don't go! One minute!

629
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:04,450
Here...keep this

630
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:07,120
- Oh no! I don't want it 
- I am sorry!

631
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,190
When someone says sorry, you can't 
stay angry

632
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:11,210
I truly do not want it

633
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:13,390
Sir! Please talk to him

634
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:17,010
- Take it, man - Take it. Just think of it 
as your first payment

635
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:19,110
I am happy with what I got! 
Thank you, Sir

636
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,160
- Joychan, come on 
- Ronnie, please...

637
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,920
You should have taken the money

638
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:31,140
Right...and then he gets drunk again...

639
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:34,120
...and complains that I stole his money

640
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:36,990
- But he offered it in front of the Police 
- I don't want it!

641
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,910
- Here you go 
- No drink for him?

642
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:43,220
He doesn't drink during the day. Such 
terrible habits!

643
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,260
So then...cheers!

644
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:50,490
- Oh no! 
- Guess it's your wife

645
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:53,190
It's her

646
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,240
Has she put a chip in you or something?

647
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:57,410
The minute you are about to have a drink, 
it's like she knows!

648
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:59,510
Quiet!

649
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:02,050
- Yes, honey 
- What did the doctor say?

650
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:05,060
- He said to be there at 10 
- Ok

651
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:08,440
- Please get home early - I will 
- Ok then

652
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:10,260
Alright

653
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:12,370
How's the new treatment working out?

654
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,050
- Will it work? - How would it work when 
she won't have the medicines on time?

655
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:19,580
She says she will have them if I join in 
for company

656
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,960
If she was talking about a bottle of 
alcohol, I could understand

657
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,080
Do you know how bitter the medicines are?

658
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:28,420
And I suppose this tastes like dessert

659
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Wherever she sees a baby, she picks 
it up...

660
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:34,140
...plays with it...makes it laugh

661
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:37,750
When I see that, it breaks my heart

662
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:55,640
Hello, Sir?

663
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:59,390
Really? When?

664
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:02,930
Ok

665
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:06,410
Alright, I will tell him

666
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:09,760
What? What happened?

667
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:11,870
A car went out of control...

668
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,830
- Huh? - It crashed into the queue 
in front of a liqour store

669
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,890
- Three people were injured 
- What?

670
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:19,350
You need to rush to the hospital

671
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:22,160
What for? I am fine!

672
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,050
- True 
- One of those three people...

673
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,730
- ...was him! 
- Who?

674
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,820
Mr. Chandy

675
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:33,210
- What? 
- He has broken his leg

676
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,720
When they asked if he wanted to 
inform anyone...

677
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:38,330
...it was your name he gave to the 
Policemen

678
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:40,430
- What? 
- Go quickly to the hospital

679
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:43,450
- You're having the best time! - You...! 
- Be quiet!

680
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:48,380
Listen...he is your first guest

681
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:51,410
Maybe it's all for the best. Please go

682
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:53,550
Go on, then...go!

683
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,440
Too bad! Only one leg is broken!

684
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,110
- Sir? 
- Ah yes! Ronnie!

685
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,530
Come in

686
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,580
Is this a bother for you?

687
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:17,030
Yes! Such a bother!

688
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:20,040
I've always liked bothering those I like

689
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:22,150
And the bother will continue for a few days

690
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,300
Why on earth were you in a liqour 
store queue?

691
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:29,510
If you ever want a place without fights 
or arguments...

692
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,860
...the liquour store queue is the only 
place in Kerala for you

693
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:36,690
- That's true! 
- And then someone rammed into the queue

694
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:39,050
It's a good thing my leg was in the way

695
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,080
Imagine if they had gone into the store

696
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:42,990
How many tipplers would have suffered!

697
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:45,100
- I say they should be shot... 
- Silence!

698
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,790
Get this medicine from the pharmacy. 
It's on the second floor.

699
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:53,220
- Ok - Sister! One second, please! 
- What?

700
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,360
Is there a liqour store nearby?

701
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:58,910
There's one right here! We can give it 
you as injections thrice a day, ok?

702
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:01,030
Will that do?

703
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:03,950
I think she will wind up the excise 
department

704
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,640
I will be back...with the medicines

705
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:08,780
- Have money? 
- Yes

706
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:11,010
By the way...the medicine...

707
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:13,030
...do you need a half bottle or full?

708
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:15,710
Full!

709
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:30,310
What are you doing? Don't strain 
yourself

710
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,500
- Come in! 
- Hello, Sir!

711
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:35,860
Sir...this is my friend, Munna

712
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,960
- Oh! 
- Hello

713
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:48,540
Like a feather in the wind, trying to 
find its way

714
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,820
Up! You!

715
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,530
Get out!

716
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:56,070
I will be with you like the rain 
that never goes away

717
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:58,990
Never taking leave of each other

718
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,950
(song) With a glance, without a word... 
- Careful!

719
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:06,300
Could both of you go and get the bags?

720
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,480
- It's a small bag. He can get it 
- It takes two to get that bag. Go!

721
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:11,590
Lets shed our pain

722
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:15,420
And slowly, take wing like 
a rainbow

723
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,880
He's quite the casanova, huh?

724
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:52,870
Come here, little one! What happened 
to you?

725
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:03,690
Even if our children don't want us...

726
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,490
...we haven't had enough of loving them

727
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:08,630
She knows that

728
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,140
It was her idea to start this daycare

729
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:24,890
- You were all at George Sir's wedding, 
weren't you? - Yes

730
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:28,180
It was for us she was getting the food 
that day

731
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:33,490
Are you sleepy, baby?

732
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:36,290
Enough? Have some more!

733
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:40,460
- Sorry 
- That's alright

734
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:42,580
You are sponsoring their food for the day!

735
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:45,310
- What? 
- Hope you have the 5000 rupees

736
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:50,140
- I do 
- Then don't just stand there! Serve!

737
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,030
- Oh...ok... 
- Move aside

738
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,260
Like a white lotus bud

739
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:58,950
Like a white marble sculpture

740
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:01,030
Maiden, stepping in the pool to bathe

741
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:04,900
Can I join you?

742
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:08,020
What if someone were to come?

743
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:10,670
What if someone finds us?

744
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:12,710
What if someone finds out?

745
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:16,200
Like a white lotus bud

746
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:18,690
Like a white marble sculpture

747
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:21,250
Maiden, step in the pool to bathe

748
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:24,980
By my side, swaying to the notes 
of a song

749
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,950
Emergency! Three, please!

750
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:29,080
What are you pushing for? Let me 
have my drink!

751
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:31,260
Shining in the light of a beacon

752
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,150
Let's fill our eyes

753
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:35,440
With desires

754
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,440
- Why did you take my drink? 
- Who me?

755
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,560
- I saw you take my drink 
- I did not

756
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:44,870
Brother, let's not get into an argument

757
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:46,900
I don't take people's drinks!

758
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:48,940
- Keep that there! 
There is moonlight and clouds in our dreams

759
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:52,070
For the first time in our path

760
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:03,570
Like a feather in the wind, trying 
to find it's way

761
01:03:03,590 --> 01:03:06,450
- What? What's the problem? 
- We don't want to create any problems!

762
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:09,180
Without ever letting up

763
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:11,260
I will be with you like the rain

764
01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:13,560
- Hello! - Hey! Look who's here! 
- Hi!

765
01:03:13,610 --> 01:03:16,080
- This is my friend Gemma 
- Hello! Come on! Dance!

766
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:18,580
With a glance, without a word

767
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:22,460
I will be with your shade all along

768
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:26,220
Lets leave our pains far behind

769
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:29,440
- Move! 
- No! Just stay with me!

770
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:52,200
Jesus! Please let this be the one!

771
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:03,990
Looks like the girl's dad likes you

772
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:06,020
If you want to ask something, this is 
the time

773
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:09,710
What is the groom whispering about, Broker?

774
01:04:09,790 --> 01:04:12,240
- Broker? I am the prospective groom! 
- What?

775
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:14,730
- So who is this? 
- The groom's friend

776
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,760
- So who are you? 
- I am the Broker

777
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,880
See? I've got an iPad and everything!

778
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:22,060
So then, shall we meet the girl?

779
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:25,060
We were looking for a Government employee

780
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:27,160
Since you are here anyway, might 
as well have tea

781
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:29,550
My girl! Bring them the tea

782
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:37,860
Go serve it to them, daughter

783
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:43,740
Hello

784
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:45,820
Won't you have a laddoo?

785
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:47,950
Go on! Take one!

786
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:55,530
If you want to talk to the girl, 
do it now

787
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:59,050
- But I have nothing to ask 
- At least ask for her name

788
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,550
- What's your name? 
- Panna...I mean...Munna

789
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:05,360
- What? - Munna 
- These are names these days?

790
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:08,070
What's the friend's name?

791
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,160
- I... - Why do you want to know? Are you 
going to marry me and run away with him?

792
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:14,260
May you spend the rest of your life serving 
tea and laddoos!

793
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,680
I bet no government employee comes 
this way, you moron!

794
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:26,250
I guess....I'll leave...

795
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,560
What? You're leaving?

796
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:39,520
- Need anything else Ma'am? 
- No. You can go - Ok

797
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,020
Has this Bengali been with you a long time?

798
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:46,520
Yes. He is Daddy's driver. Dumb, 
just like Daddy!

799
01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:48,670
So I bring him along for trips 
like this

800
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:51,860
This place is great!

801
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,710
- This is where my friends and I have get 
togethers - Oh!

802
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:57,750
- Can't you drink in moderation? 
- That's enough!

803
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,840
You're done! There's nothing left. 
Come on

804
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:02,320
- Come! 
- Let me go!

805
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,050
When you said this last girl would be the 
one, did you mean for you?

806
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:07,690
- I don't want her! Just come! 
- This is what I always say...

807
01:06:07,770 --> 01:06:11,340
...when you're meeting a girl, you should 
take friends less attractive than you

808
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:14,470
- Understood? - How would we find someone 
less attractive than you? - Quiet!

809
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,740
My wedding plans got messed up because of 
his damned looks!

810
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:19,820
- Did you know that? - Come here! 
- Come, sit here.

811
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:23,900
Wherever I went to meet a girl, they all 
wanted government employees

812
01:06:23,970 --> 01:06:25,970
But if they ever want to run away...

813
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:28,650
...they will go with bus drivers or auto 
drivers...

814
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:30,700
...or even the Bengali who sells pani-puri

815
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:33,440
I'm done with this!

816
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:36,620
I want no bride or wedding or anything!

817
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:38,970
That's great! I had decided that long back!

818
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,900
I love you! Here's a kiss for you!

819
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:42,970
Why such a decision?

820
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,560
Why do people get married anyway?

821
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:51,760
Maybe because I grew up seeing my Daddy 
silent and ashamed before my Mummy

822
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:55,630
I've never felt any attachment to any man 
ever!

823
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:58,950
In public, they would put up such an act!

824
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:01,020
Made for each other!

825
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:03,750
Once at a party, my Mummy...

826
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:05,790
...handed me a glass like this one

827
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:10,490
It was the first thing she ever gave me 
with love...so it felt like heaven!

828
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:15,070
You must have so much to remember 
when you think of your mother

829
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:18,640
For me, it is when I see this that I 
remember my mother

830
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,440
How did your mother die?

831
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Who said she died?

832
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,080
She left one day in a huff over something

833
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:41,190
A year later, I came to know she married 
a Priest and settled in America

834
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:44,170
- A Priest? 
- Yes. Jacobite Priests can get married.

835
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:48,810
He's a Priest. So maybe he thought he 
should carry a cross of his own!

836
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:52,100
Always be happy! Be free!

837
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:54,140
Why get married? I feel...

838
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:57,130
...its better to have no relationships 
at all!

839
01:07:57,290 --> 01:07:58,990
That's just your age talking!

840
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:00,890
That will change with time

841
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:05,270
There will be a time you wish for someone 
to sit by you and talk to you

842
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:08,130
One fine day...

843
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:10,630
...you feel the emptiness of having 
no one

844
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:14,400
It's a terrible feeling, child. You won't 
understand it right now

845
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:16,570
But I think Ronnie would. Am I right?

846
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:19,080
What? You have a flashback too?

847
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,840
Flashback...?

848
01:08:25,570 --> 01:08:27,570
Yes, I do have one

849
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:30,890
(Ronnie humming a prayer song)

850
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,350
Not one familiar face!

851
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:37,310
What about you, Grandma? When are 
you making it to the Obits?

852
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:41,260
I will be seeing your picture in there 
before I make it there

853
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:43,810
We're going to the market. Need meat 
or something?

854
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:46,020
- Yes, a kilo for us please, Micheal Etta 
- Ok

855
01:08:46,090 --> 01:08:49,010
- Kochumon! Make sure to get ribs 
- I think you already have one too many!

856
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,080
Sure you need more?

857
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:53,510
Don't laugh so hard! It wasn't that funny!

858
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:55,740
- And you get lost! 
- Ok! If you say so!

859
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:04,350
Ok. Let's go

860
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:07,720
What's with the action-comedy?

861
01:09:08,430 --> 01:09:11,020
It's nothing. He asked if we wanted...

862
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,940
...big candles or small ones...

863
01:09:12,990 --> 01:09:14,910
- ...for the family meet 
- Keep it small

864
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:18,160
Or I will see you in the Obits too soon!

865
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:29,630
First a Church service...and then a couple 
of pegs from a shared bottle...

866
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:31,900
...then lunch with rice, buttermilk 
curry...

867
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:34,020
...some sauteed beans and beef...

868
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:37,340
That's what makes a great Sunday!

869
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:42,220
What happened? Your mood seems to be off

870
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,950
- It's nothing 
- Is it because I did not pay my share?

871
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,600
- Here you go - It's not that 
- Thank you

872
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:50,650
No, but give me that!

873
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:53,750
He did not seem to like the last 
girl either

874
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:58,900
- Why? What was wrong with her? 
- He said she was too short or something

875
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:01,310
- Too short? 
- Dad!

876
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:05,320
- Yes! Ask him what the problem is 
- Ok

877
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:08,470
Mom's calling you, Dad! She needs you 
to scrape the coconut

878
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:14,570
Thank God! I've been waiting 
for a while!

879
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,110
- Hey! 
- What?

880
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:21,740
How did you figure out from a passport 
size photo that the girl was too short?

881
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:23,910
That...that wouldn't have worked out 
anyway

882
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:26,050
Really? Why?

883
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:29,050
Are you in love with someone?

884
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:31,440
Me? No...Icha...

885
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:37,540
Tell me if you are! I'll make sure the 
girl is yours!

886
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:40,220
Well...no...Icha...there's nothing 
like that

887
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:42,660
- Alright then, Cheers! 
- Cheers!

888
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:46,400
- Oh no! 
- What happened?

889
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:49,300
- Forgot to add water! 
- Here! Have some!

890
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:27,720
Stop drawing in your food and eat!

891
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:29,800
I am not hungry

892
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:32,330
- Then let me have your beef 
- Ok

893
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:36,570
- Icha... - Yes? 
- When people elope...

894
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:39,320
...is it ok to tell someone where they 
are going?

895
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,570
- When eloping? - Yes - It's a great idea 
to tell someone where you are going

896
01:11:43,450 --> 01:11:45,180
Why do you want to know anyway?

897
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:49,710
Well...if we get into any trouble when we 
elope, you will need to come get us

898
01:11:49,970 --> 01:11:53,040
- That's why I asked 
- 'Us'?

899
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:55,370
- So who's eloping? 
- Me and Kochumon!

900
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:58,790
- When? - We haven't set a date but we 
are madly in love

901
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,580
- He is scared of you so he says we'll 
elope - What's this girl saying?

902
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:05,260
You be quiet, Grandma! Icha, I am scared! 
Tell him not to make me elope!

903
01:12:05,330 --> 01:12:08,410
- Tell him? I am going to break his bones! 
- No, Icha! Don't!

904
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:10,780
He is a nice guy! Don't do anything to him!

905
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:13,430
Are you really...

906
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:15,420
...so much in love with him?

907
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:17,740
Not all that much...but...

908
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:20,720
...when I look at him for a long time, I 
feel in love

909
01:12:20,810 --> 01:12:22,450
In that case don't look at him for long!

910
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:25,700
if I hear the words love or eloping 
in this house again...

911
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,760
...I will tear you to pieces!

912
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:30,040
- In that case, give my beef back to me! 
- What?

913
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:33,310
There were two more pieces!

914
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:37,550
Watch out - you are going to die of 
cholesterol!

915
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,660
Why did you leave me with such 
a hard-hearted guy?

916
01:12:49,650 --> 01:12:52,880
Could you make Icha agree? Please?

917
01:12:54,030 --> 01:12:56,640
What? Really? You will?

918
01:12:57,210 --> 01:12:59,900
Will you, really? Thank you!

919
01:13:00,090 --> 01:13:02,090
- Kiss you! 
- Grandma! Where is that women's magazine?

920
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:04,510
Must be in her room!

921
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:12,190
If my Dad and Mom had been alive, they 
would have made all my wishes come true!

922
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:16,310
Look here! This is your usual trick! 
Won't work this time

923
01:13:17,330 --> 01:13:19,890
- How many times have you been in love 
anyway? - 8 times!

924
01:13:20,090 --> 01:13:23,600
- What? - 7 of those times, it was the guy 
who chased me and proposed to me

925
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:26,840
But this one...I was the one who 
chased him

926
01:13:26,910 --> 01:13:29,090
Shameless! Wait till I...!

927
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:31,990
Grandma! He is trying to kill me!

928
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:34,790
There! Someone's ringing the bell. 
Go open the door. Go!

929
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:37,450
Good Lord!

930
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:39,980
- Go check! - When I am back, see what 
I do to you!

931
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:42,050
Just because I am understanding...!

932
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:44,450
- Who's there? 
- It's us!

933
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,600
Why were we hearing fireworks inside?

934
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:50,050
Fireworks...will be bursting soon!

935
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,240
Sit down

936
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,050
Why're you here, Micheal Etta?

937
01:13:59,150 --> 01:14:03,130
As you know...we have been looking for a 
bride for him for a while now

938
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:05,430
Whichever girl he meets...

939
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:07,930
...he says they are too short or too dark

940
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:11,100
It's only today he told us the reason 
for dropping those proposals

941
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:13,830
He is in love with our girl, Ruby!

942
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:15,800
If he'd just said this before...

943
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:18,690
...we needn't have wasted time 
with all those other girls!

944
01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:20,990
What's your opinion?

945
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:24,740
Please!

946
01:14:26,150 --> 01:14:28,150
I am not for it

947
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:36,220
- Why? - They are more interested in 
eloping than getting married

948
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:38,870
Why don't we just let them do that?

949
01:14:39,010 --> 01:14:41,010
That would also save us some money

950
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:47,330
- Dad...I... 
- You...idiot...!

951
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:52,040
- You are cleverer than we thought! 
- Thanks - Get lost!

952
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:12,440
My darling little flower

953
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:15,900
Your smile is an auspicious sight to me

954
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:19,590
My little sister, apple of my eye

955
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:22,860
I always treasure you in me

956
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:26,920
Within the walls of my mind

957
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:30,350
You flit about like a mischeivous dragonfly

958
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:34,170
Your anklets chime

959
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:37,010
As you float towards me

960
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:40,780
You are the melody of the lullaby 
within your brother's heart

961
01:15:40,830 --> 01:15:43,240
Please sit down...come 
(Reciting prayers)

962
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:48,440
My darling little flower

963
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:52,080
Your smile is an auspicious sight 
to me

964
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:55,450
My little sister, apple of my eye

965
01:15:55,620 --> 01:16:00,160
I always treasure you in me

966
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:05,090
- Grandma... 
- Seek the blessings of your parents first

967
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,900
Dad...Mom...

968
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:15,040
Praise be to Lord Jesus

969
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:25,960
Grandma...Praise be to Lord Jesus

970
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:29,180
My child!

971
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:38,290
You...both of you...

972
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:40,350
...don't cry and make a scene!

973
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:48,700
- Icha... 
- What, girl...?

974
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:52,970
It's time...you should leave now...

975
01:16:57,540 --> 01:16:59,050
Icha...

976
01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:02,510
Praise be to Lord Jesus

977
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:07,050
Now...and forever!

978
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:28,050
He told me not to cry

979
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:30,160
And see what he is doing!

980
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:34,080
For God's sake! The way you are all 
crying...

981
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:36,180
...it's like you are sending her away 
to Antartica

982
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:38,430
She'll be right next door!

983
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:41,380
If you look over the wall, you can see 
her cooking in the kitchen!

984
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:43,420
- So why are you crying? 
- But that will never happen! - Why?

985
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:45,790
If he wants to hide something from her, 
he puts it in the kitchen!

986
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:48,150
The kitchen is the only place she 
never enters!

987
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:49,820
Great!

988
01:17:49,850 --> 01:17:52,510
Good reason for a mother-in-law 
to get irritated

989
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:56,220
Why would I? It is my husband who does 
all the work at home!

990
01:17:57,990 --> 01:18:00,460
I'll see you soon...Icha...

991
01:18:00,590 --> 01:18:02,590
Go on now...get in...

992
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:31,670
Will you hurry, child?

993
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:35,190
- Grandma! Be sure to pack the monkey cap! 
- Alright alright

994
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:39,860
Anything else to pack?

995
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:42,480
- The medicine box! 
- I've packed that!

996
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,410
- Packed the monkey cap? 
- I've packed it, monkey!

997
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:49,470
- The cap, I mean 
- Hmm! Here...

998
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:53,950
Icha...how do I look?

999
01:18:54,450 --> 01:18:57,410
- Why are you wearing all this jewellery? 
- Grandma said I could

1000
01:18:57,550 --> 01:18:59,240
No, no! Don't wear all that! Put it away!

1001
01:18:59,330 --> 01:19:02,730
- She's a new bride. Let her wear it - She 
won't take care of it - I will!

1002
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,800
- Promise! 
- She'll take care...

1003
01:19:05,130 --> 01:19:08,410
- Are you ready, child?' 
- Come on, you fool! Let's go! - Coming!

1004
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:10,700
- Can you keep my bag, Dad? 
- See you soon! - Ok!

1005
01:19:11,470 --> 01:19:14,230
- Kochumon! - Yes? 
- First Ootty and then Munnar

1006
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:16,250
Five days and then you should get 
back home

1007
01:19:16,330 --> 01:19:18,330
Don't elope or anything!

1008
01:19:18,370 --> 01:19:20,370
- See you soon 
- Byel son!

1009
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:22,450
- Come on! 
- Hold on a sec...

1010
01:19:23,190 --> 01:19:26,110
It's her first time...away without me...

1011
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:29,340
She's just a naive girl...please take care 
of her

1012
01:19:29,490 --> 01:19:31,310
I'll take care, Icha

1013
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,440
Bye Dad!

1014
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:36,000
Icha, Bye! Tata!

1015
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:38,930
Bye Grandma! Bye! Icha...

1016
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,270
- Buh-bye! 
- Come in and have tea

1017
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:43,190
I'm staying for lunch too!

1018
01:19:43,470 --> 01:19:46,530
- I can escape my wife for some time! 
- Don't let her hear you!

1019
01:19:46,610 --> 01:19:48,740
(On TV) 'Welcome to Charge Sheet'

1020
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:51,830
'Newly-wed groom found murdered 
in Munnar'

1021
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,700
'Bride admitted to hospital with severe 
injuries'

1022
01:20:00,010 --> 01:20:02,880
The victim, Ebin, belongs to Chellanam 
in Ernakulam

1023
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,060
He was cruelly murdered...

1024
01:20:05,130 --> 01:20:07,750
...wrapped in a plastic sheet and dumped 
here

1025
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:11,320
(Reporters recording their news updates)

1026
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:15,700
His wife was viciously attacked as well

1027
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:17,760
This area has a lot of wildlife

1028
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:20,390
The girl seems to have been attacked by 
a wild animal

1029
01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:40,370
It took 15 days...

1030
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:42,700
...for her to regain her memory

1031
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:46,760
I...want nothing except...

1032
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:51,160
...to see her smile again

1033
01:21:44,910 --> 01:21:47,050
- Hello? - Have you reached? 
- Yes

1034
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:49,570
- Where are you? 
- I am already here

1035
01:22:10,410 --> 01:22:12,410
Wedding anniversary celebrations over?

1036
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:14,560
Ya

1037
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:17,560
And where is my treat?

1038
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,800
Now let me get you your gift

1039
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,650
(on screen) - Don't you want 
to stay longer? - No

1040
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:42,760
When next?

1041
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:45,590
Ok...Bye

1042
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:51,270
Because the camera is at that angle...

1043
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,060
...some parts are not clear

1044
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:56,170
But I guess the important bits are there

1045
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:00,260
So when are you leaving for the UK 
with your husband?

1046
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:02,760
- Next week 
- Hmm

1047
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:05,300
Alright then

1048
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,500
Is this the chain your husband gifted you?

1049
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:16,800
Yes

1050
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,760
- Diamonds? 
- Ya

1051
01:23:23,730 --> 01:23:26,890
With this....you look ever more 
beautiful!

1052
01:24:02,930 --> 01:24:04,930
Ta-da! Item Ready!

1053
01:24:16,430 --> 01:24:18,430
Sorry...I am from Swiggy

1054
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:21,410
- I got the wrong room 
- Hey! Mr Swiggy! Wait!

1055
01:24:22,610 --> 01:24:25,430
You haven't got the wrong room!

1056
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:28,950
This is Davis...and this is his 
wife, Sheela

1057
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:31,950
They're my friends...business 
partners...

1058
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:34,210
...confidantes....they're everything to me!

1059
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:37,140
Figured out who he is?

1060
01:24:37,210 --> 01:24:39,880
Of course! He must be Ronnie! 
Congrats!

1061
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,080
Did you understand what that was for?

1062
01:24:42,230 --> 01:24:45,090
Our friend takes a month off every year and 
goes into hiding like this

1063
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:47,240
No business, no contacts...nothing...

1064
01:24:47,970 --> 01:24:50,900
We usually trace him back from the 
mountains or forests...

1065
01:24:51,530 --> 01:24:55,430
But this time, thanks to you...he only 
went as far as Cochin!

1066
01:24:56,130 --> 01:24:57,860
We only have one life, Sheela

1067
01:24:57,950 --> 01:25:01,120
After a certain age, you can't even 
have a cup of tea with sugar

1068
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:03,180
So...when one is still healthy...

1069
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:05,950
...one needs to spend time to live life 
as you wish

1070
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,080
That is my policy!

1071
01:25:12,510 --> 01:25:14,120
What? Got it?

1072
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,910
This is an original cashew brew... 
want a taste?

1073
01:25:16,990 --> 01:25:19,190
- Should you? Today? 
- Guess not

1074
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:22,400
The Inspector is on duty...now I 
could get arrested for drinking!

1075
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:24,450
- Uncle Chandy! 
- Oh no!

1076
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:26,330
There she comes!

1077
01:25:28,550 --> 01:25:30,550
- Who got this for you? 
- Chechi!

1078
01:25:30,610 --> 01:25:32,610
Oh! That looks nice!

1079
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:40,470
Hi, Handsome!

1080
01:25:42,410 --> 01:25:44,340
Where'd you get this from?

1081
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,400
We met two Russians at the Biennale

1082
01:25:46,490 --> 01:25:48,250
I got it from them

1083
01:25:48,290 --> 01:25:50,230
This is my one and only daughter

1084
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:52,860
- Our own Inspector! 
- Hi

1085
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:54,440
Hello

1086
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:59,170
- Santa 
- Ronnie

1087
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:01,640
- I know 
- She is the PUBG addict

1088
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:04,670
- If I had lost that mobile... 
- If you had...

1089
01:26:04,730 --> 01:26:07,130
...I would have shot you dead!

1090
01:26:07,850 --> 01:26:09,850
And this is Aisa

1091
01:26:09,970 --> 01:26:11,970
- Hi Bro! 
- Hello

1092
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:16,960
She's their product...late to the party 
but the life of it nevertheless

1093
01:26:17,170 --> 01:26:19,170
She's a special item

1094
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:22,140
Ronnie...we are leaving today

1095
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,810
I have two villas here

1096
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:27,570
Now that they are here...we 
are shifting there

1097
01:26:27,730 --> 01:26:30,840
Hope you are free today. They have 
some shopping to do

1098
01:26:31,030 --> 01:26:33,890
- Of course he's free! Right? 
- Sure

1099
01:26:52,690 --> 01:26:54,940
- (on phone) Yes, I've told them 
- Dad! Dad!

1100
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:58,230
This...or this? Which is better?

1101
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:02,230
- Ya both are great 
- Dad!

1102
01:27:03,310 --> 01:27:05,310
- Got what you wanted? 
- Go away!

1103
01:27:05,650 --> 01:27:07,650
And I thought I would help you select 
something!

1104
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:10,770
- Didn't like any of this? - No! 
- Just pick something...

1105
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:13,440
- How is this? 
- No, no saree for me

1106
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:15,440
Hello! What brings you here?

1107
01:27:15,850 --> 01:27:18,100
- Do you usually shop here? 
- Oh no!

1108
01:27:18,230 --> 01:27:20,940
- This is my daughter - Hi 
- And that is Sheela

1109
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:22,940
-...my friend. This is Gemma 
- Hi

1110
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:25,730
- Here he comes 
- Ok...select one of these

1111
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:27,900
Oh...no...I don't need this

1112
01:27:28,350 --> 01:27:31,190
Don't say that! How is this?

1113
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:34,230
- No 
- This?

1114
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:37,060
- That's good 
- Then we fix this

1115
01:27:38,730 --> 01:27:41,270
- Hey! - Sister! 
- Don't jump! - Stay here!

1116
01:27:41,310 --> 01:27:43,190
- Just stay here! 
- Oh no....

1117
01:27:43,230 --> 01:27:46,270
- Come here, Dad! 
- No! Not me!

1118
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:49,060
You have to come, Uncle Chandy!

1119
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:51,100
- Are you scared? 
- No! I won't come there!

1120
01:27:51,190 --> 01:27:54,270
No! What...don't get your clothes wet!

1121
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:56,270
Please...kids!

1122
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:58,520
Please!

1123
01:27:59,230 --> 01:28:00,350
Oh no!

1124
01:28:14,230 --> 01:28:16,850
The celebration looks grand this year! 
Awesome!

1125
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:19,690
Santa! My child!

1126
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:22,940
- All this was taken in the other room 
- Santa! My child!

1127
01:28:23,350 --> 01:28:25,350
Were you sitting here?

1128
01:28:25,350 --> 01:28:28,690
Here you go! Happy Birthday to you!

1129
01:28:30,650 --> 01:28:32,060
Take it, honey!

1130
01:28:32,150 --> 01:28:34,150
Hey! Take it!

1131
01:28:34,650 --> 01:28:36,650
Just take it!

1132
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:41,060
Oh! Hi!

1133
01:28:41,150 --> 01:28:43,150
How are you, Sir?

1134
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,020
Oh, I got it! Something auspicious 
is going on...

1135
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:49,350
...and I come in, uninvited!

1136
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:51,480
That's what you are thinking, aren't you? 
I got that!

1137
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:53,560
But how could I not come? Also...

1138
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:55,690
...I need some money

1139
01:28:55,810 --> 01:28:58,060
Where else would I go when I have an 
urgent need of money?

1140
01:28:59,650 --> 01:29:01,560
Right, honey?

1141
01:29:01,690 --> 01:29:03,690
- Chandy Sir.. 
- Yes

1142
01:29:04,230 --> 01:29:05,810
- What's up, Ronnie? 
- All set, Sir

1143
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:09,270
- Let's start then. Come on, honey 
- What about my gift?

1144
01:29:35,980 --> 01:29:38,900
(singing) Happy Birthday to you...

1145
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:42,560
Happy Birthday to you...

1146
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:45,730
Happy Birthday, dear Santa...

1147
01:29:46,350 --> 01:29:48,350
Happy Birthday to you...

1148
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:52,940
- Ronnie! Come here! 
- Go on!

1149
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,400
Move your hand!

1150
01:30:11,020 --> 01:30:14,020
Ronnie! Is he going to be in my way?

1151
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:16,270
Guess not!

1152
01:30:32,350 --> 01:30:35,690
Hearts are light and minds full of love 
Watch us! Come on!

1153
01:30:35,770 --> 01:30:38,730
Rise together in joy, dance and sing 
with us!

1154
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:42,270
Hearts are light and minds full of love; 
Watch us! Come on!

1155
01:30:42,350 --> 01:30:45,320
Rise together in joy; dance and sing 
with us

1156
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:47,920
Little butterfly

1157
01:30:47,970 --> 01:30:51,310
Will you join us on this jasmine 
bough?

1158
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:58,030
Little butterfly

1159
01:30:58,090 --> 01:31:01,010
Will you join us on this jasmine 
bough?

1160
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:04,190
Come closer, mischievous one!

1161
01:31:04,650 --> 01:31:07,350
Will you sing with us this evening?

1162
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:12,100
All the world is crazy about you

1163
01:31:12,170 --> 01:31:15,200
The world will dance to your tunes!

1164
01:31:15,450 --> 01:31:18,590
There is a sparkle in your eyes

1165
01:31:18,770 --> 01:31:21,750
Come join us, pretty girl!

1166
01:31:22,050 --> 01:31:25,050
Forget your worries; give her your 
good wishes and pick up the Dhol

1167
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:00,200
We've been waiting for you

1168
01:32:00,780 --> 01:32:03,410
With surprises awaiting

1169
01:32:04,070 --> 01:32:07,350
We've been waiting for you 
With surprises awaiting

1170
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:10,630
We always remember, dear girl

1171
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:13,930
We've been waiting for you 
With surprises awaiting

1172
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:17,430
We always remember, dear girl

1173
01:32:17,510 --> 01:32:20,680
Like the Moon has come down from 
its heights

1174
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:23,870
I have seen the sparkle in your dark eyes

1175
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:26,850
When you come closer with your music, 
dear girl

1176
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:30,480
You must have heard the song 
of the wind

1177
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:36,070
Let mind and body come together; lets 
smile and play on!

1178
01:33:10,290 --> 01:33:13,380
Coming down from the skies

1179
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:16,420
Are all the stars in Heaven

1180
01:33:16,910 --> 01:33:20,160
Coming down from the skies 
Are all the stars in Heaven

1181
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:23,430
They play a tune for you, dear girl

1182
01:33:23,530 --> 01:33:26,730
Coming down from the skies, 
All the stars in Heaven

1183
01:33:26,830 --> 01:33:29,970
Play a tune for you, dear girl!

1184
01:33:30,150 --> 01:33:33,230
Have all the Gods come down from 
the skies?

1185
01:33:33,390 --> 01:33:36,630
And given a you a gift in a 
casket of clouds?

1186
01:33:36,830 --> 01:33:40,050
The golden lotus will be here to make 
friends with you

1187
01:33:40,070 --> 01:33:43,250
Come angel, you golden mirage

1188
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:47,980
Let mind and body come together; lets 
smile and play on!

1189
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:09,800
- Hello Sir - Hello 
- Please come

1190
01:35:11,850 --> 01:35:13,850
- Please sit 
- Thanks

1191
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:29,460
- Hello 
- Please sit

1192
01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:36,770
Sorry...I...

1193
01:35:37,420 --> 01:35:39,420
Do you know of any trouble he had 
in business or anything?

1194
01:35:39,830 --> 01:35:41,830
Did he ever mention anything of the sort?

1195
01:35:43,490 --> 01:35:45,490
No...he...

1196
01:35:45,700 --> 01:35:47,700
He...

1197
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:53,010
There was nothing of the sort

1198
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:55,690
He was planning to open another 
restaurant

1199
01:35:55,820 --> 01:35:57,720
It was in the planning stage

1200
01:35:57,790 --> 01:36:00,830
- Other than that... 
- Was it your wedding that was fixed?

1201
01:36:01,390 --> 01:36:04,270
- Yes - What's your name? 
- Tanisha

1202
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:06,500
- And yours? 
- Tasni

1203
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:12,230
Sir...for a while Dad seemed to 
be tensed

1204
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:15,880
- Maybe that was related to the wedding? 
- No

1205
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:18,850
No Sir...whatever the matter...

1206
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:20,980
...he would always discuss it with Mom

1207
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:25,020
But...last week, without informing 
anyone...

1208
01:36:25,590 --> 01:36:27,590
...he had withdrawn 50 lakhs

1209
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:30,580
And it was the day after that, that he...

1210
01:36:35,130 --> 01:36:37,970
As far as I understand, whether 
at home or in business...

1211
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:40,080
...he was not facing any problems

1212
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:44,820
Why then do you think...your Dad...

1213
01:36:44,970 --> 01:36:46,970
...committed suicide?

1214
01:36:53,950 --> 01:36:55,950
- Honey! 
- Yes, Dad?

1215
01:36:57,320 --> 01:37:00,340
What! You are not ready yet?

1216
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
- You go on, Dad 
- Why? What happened?

1217
01:37:03,370 --> 01:37:05,370
I am not in a mood to travel

1218
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:08,450
It's because you said you want to see 
Alappuzha that I planned my meeting there

1219
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:11,060
Maybe we'll go next time. Now you leave

1220
01:37:11,190 --> 01:37:13,190
- Sure? You're alright? 
- Yes!

1221
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,620
Ok then. I'll see you later

1222
01:37:16,690 --> 01:37:19,510
- Dad! - Hmm? 
- When are we going back?

1223
01:37:19,610 --> 01:37:23,140
After Easter. Joy is planning a grand 
affair. Why?

1224
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:25,780
- What's the matter, Honey? 
- Nothing, Dad. Go on

1225
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:28,680
- Shall we go then? 
- Ok

1226
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:33,070
- You're not coming? - No 
- She's still tired from last night

1227
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:35,770
At home too, both of them are still 
asleep

1228
01:37:35,890 --> 01:37:38,440
- See you then. Take care - Ok 
- Bye, child

1229
01:37:55,450 --> 01:37:57,450
Good morning!

1230
01:38:27,210 --> 01:38:29,960
Sorry...I couldn't say it yesterday

1231
01:38:30,740 --> 01:38:32,740
Belated birthday wishes!

1232
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:43,860
- Thanks, Mother 
- Thanks indeed!

1233
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:49,020
I forced her to wait. Or else she would've 
come to the birthday despite her fever

1234
01:38:49,780 --> 01:38:52,640
- How are you now, Mother? 
- It was nothing

1235
01:38:53,670 --> 01:38:56,990
For a few days now, I have been having 
dreams about her

1236
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:59,840
Disturbing dreams

1237
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:02,200
When I saw you in person...

1238
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:04,280
...I feel relieved!

1239
01:39:04,990 --> 01:39:07,640
So Chandy...was the birthday function 
awesome?

1240
01:39:07,770 --> 01:39:10,250
- Did you have a grand spread? 
- Of course!

1241
01:39:10,310 --> 01:39:12,600
- You really missed it, Sister! 
- It's so sad!

1242
01:39:12,650 --> 01:39:16,040
- It's alright, Sister...the main function 
is only coming up - Huh?

1243
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:19,190
Her wedding! It is time

1244
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:23,380
- Don't you think so, Chandy? - Of course! 
And then we will plan a menu you'll enjoy!

1245
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:26,180
Really? I will be here a week in advance!

1246
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:28,960
- Chandy Sir? 
- Ah yes, Ronnie. Got everything?

1247
01:39:29,150 --> 01:39:33,270
I did. I went all the way to Ernakulam 
market to get the dry shark you wanted

1248
01:39:33,350 --> 01:39:35,120
That's why I was delayed...also...

1249
01:39:35,140 --> 01:39:38,840
I have packed some of my Grandma's 
special fish pickle and chutney too

1250
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:43,260
Chutney? I could have three plates of rice 
with that alone!

1251
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:47,590
You do that with no curry either!

1252
01:39:48,170 --> 01:39:50,770
Ronnie...please drop them to the 
railway station

1253
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:52,820
Sure, Sir...I will wait outside

1254
01:39:53,290 --> 01:39:55,910
- What a nice lad 
- We will take our leave then

1255
01:39:55,970 --> 01:39:57,970
Ronnie! Pass me some of that chutney

1256
01:39:58,070 --> 01:40:00,070
Let me try out your Grandma's specialty

1257
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:03,160
I'll see you later, child

1258
01:40:06,580 --> 01:40:09,400
Here...keep this rosary

1259
01:40:09,710 --> 01:40:11,710
Wear it around your neck at all times

1260
01:40:13,110 --> 01:40:14,260
I will

1261
01:40:28,870 --> 01:40:31,640
I still can't believe Basheer Sir is gone

1262
01:40:32,740 --> 01:40:35,340
Such a kind-hearted man!

1263
01:40:37,630 --> 01:40:39,760
Anything that the children here need...

1264
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:41,840
...he was always ready to provide

1265
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:44,820
Please have some tea

1266
01:40:49,970 --> 01:40:54,530
He was planning to get two of our girls 
married off before your daughter's wedding

1267
01:40:54,930 --> 01:40:56,930
He even found grooms for them

1268
01:40:57,130 --> 01:41:00,010
But what can we do now? It is the 
girls' fate!

1269
01:41:00,770 --> 01:41:03,940
That's why we are here. Those weddings 
should happen

1270
01:41:04,590 --> 01:41:07,690
- Just let us know how much money 
you need - No

1271
01:41:08,330 --> 01:41:11,340
- Now that your daughter's wedding has 
been called off... - That's ok

1272
01:41:11,530 --> 01:41:14,410
This was something he really wanted. 
That should happen.

1273
01:41:16,250 --> 01:41:18,250
God's blessings will be on you!

1274
01:41:18,660 --> 01:41:21,950
- Isn't your sister here? 
- She is with the children outside

1275
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:24,200
Where is she?

1276
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:27,340
You wait in the car, Mom. I will go 
get her

1277
01:41:41,050 --> 01:41:43,290
- I have completed 12th Grade 
- Come, honey...let's go

1278
01:41:43,460 --> 01:41:45,460
Sister...this is a friend of Dad's

1279
01:41:54,970 --> 01:41:56,970
- Hi 
- Hello

1280
01:42:04,220 --> 01:42:06,220
- Go wait in the car. I'll be right 
there. - Ok

1281
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:08,500
- Bye 
- Bye

1282
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:13,280
- Your sister is beautiful too 
- Huh?

1283
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:15,600
Just like her elder sister

1284
01:42:16,830 --> 01:42:19,060
- I haven't... 
- Seen me before?

1285
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:21,500
But I've seen you

1286
01:42:21,700 --> 01:42:23,700
Basheer Sir and I were good friends

1287
01:42:24,610 --> 01:42:26,940
- Oh? 
- Thick friends, really. Look

1288
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,640
If I release these pictures in 
public...

1289
01:42:50,890 --> 01:42:52,890
...it will be the end for your sister 
and you

1290
01:42:54,090 --> 01:42:56,090
Also the image your Father had in public

1291
01:42:57,640 --> 01:42:59,640
And when your mother comes to know...

1292
01:42:59,950 --> 01:43:02,990
...she may commit suicide just like 
your Dad

1293
01:43:03,270 --> 01:43:05,270
These are the thoughts in your head 
right now, aren't they?

1294
01:43:06,930 --> 01:43:08,930
But hey...no!

1295
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:11,640
I wouldn't do that

1296
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:21,030
In any case, it's a good thing your 
wedding was called off

1297
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:47,300
Why aren't you saying anything?

1298
01:43:49,540 --> 01:43:53,410
You were the one who said you wanted 
to know why your father killed himself

1299
01:43:53,820 --> 01:43:55,820
Then why are you doing this now?

1300
01:43:56,670 --> 01:43:58,670
I am asking you why you are withdrawing 
your complaint?

1301
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:03,860
My sister and I need to live on. That's why

1302
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:38,360
Good girl!

1303
01:44:46,220 --> 01:44:49,850
If you need more, make it yourself. It's 
not my fault the girl didn't like you

1304
01:44:50,030 --> 01:44:52,030
Her father was a sport though

1305
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:56,220
He hit the Broker but he made us 
have tea and snacks before we left

1306
01:44:57,660 --> 01:44:59,660
So then, Cheers! Dear forefathers...

1307
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:04,790
- What's this? - All my forefathers 
were drunks

1308
01:45:04,930 --> 01:45:07,390
Can't get them more drunk! My Dad 
was a drunk too

1309
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:09,600
- But he stopped when Feroze came 
along - Feroze?

1310
01:45:09,930 --> 01:45:11,930
Who's that? A friend of your Dad's?

1311
01:45:12,010 --> 01:45:14,010
No...it's that illness that attacks 
your liver

1312
01:45:14,170 --> 01:45:16,170
- That's cirhossis! 
- Ya, that's when he stopped!

1313
01:45:17,210 --> 01:45:20,100
Is your name really Munna?

1314
01:45:20,980 --> 01:45:23,400
- Is it, really? 
- Of course...why?

1315
01:45:23,450 --> 01:45:25,740
Some guys with terrible names...

1316
01:45:25,780 --> 01:45:27,730
...sometimes call themselves Munna

1317
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:30,310
- That's why I asked... 
- I...

1318
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:33,760
- Have a drink, Brother - No! There will 
be police checking on the road

1319
01:45:33,810 --> 01:45:36,570
With the money we pay as fine, we could 
as well have a party at home!

1320
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:40,810
And it's not just that...my wife says drink 
at home if you need to

1321
01:45:40,970 --> 01:45:42,970
So I've stopped drinking out of home

1322
01:45:43,450 --> 01:45:46,240
I am almost thinking of quitting 
altogether

1323
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:48,340
- What? 
- That's the joke of the year!

1324
01:45:48,690 --> 01:45:50,360
It's the Broker

1325
01:45:50,430 --> 01:45:53,030
Where are we going bride 
hunting next?

1326
01:45:53,540 --> 01:45:56,080
- What? 
- Have one, Joychayan

1327
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:58,200
- No, I shouldn't 
- What's the matter?

1328
01:45:58,610 --> 01:46:00,610
Why are you so low on energy?

1329
01:46:01,390 --> 01:46:03,970
It's actually not my wife's fault 
we can't have children

1330
01:46:05,570 --> 01:46:07,570
The fault is mine

1331
01:46:08,690 --> 01:46:12,430
She was trying to make me have medicines 
without letting me know it was my fault

1332
01:46:13,090 --> 01:46:15,090
That's why she made that excuse 
about wanting company

1333
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:19,290
Finally, when she thought I just couldn't 
give up drinking...

1334
01:46:19,830 --> 01:46:21,830
...she said, if that's what makes you 
happy...

1335
01:46:22,060 --> 01:46:24,060
...maybe I'll join you too

1336
01:46:29,270 --> 01:46:31,270
This is her now

1337
01:46:32,150 --> 01:46:34,150
- Yes, honey? 
- Will you be late?

1338
01:46:34,250 --> 01:46:36,250
- No, I am just heading home 
- Had dinner?

1339
01:46:36,350 --> 01:46:38,350
- No...I'll have dinner with you 
- Ok

1340
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:46,260
When I am about to have a drink...or 
when my eyes are filling up...

1341
01:46:46,510 --> 01:46:48,510
...she can sense it immediately

1342
01:46:50,050 --> 01:46:53,060
We can never really understand women!

1343
01:46:54,270 --> 01:46:56,270
They're a miracle!

1344
01:47:03,620 --> 01:47:05,840
- What's the matter? 
- What you said is true

1345
01:47:06,650 --> 01:47:09,500
We really can't ever understand women!

1346
01:47:09,620 --> 01:47:11,360
Why? What's happened?

1347
01:47:11,450 --> 01:47:14,230
She agreed to the wedding!

1348
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:16,340
She said she wants to get married to me!

1349
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:19,510
- That's great, man! 
- She is smart!

1350
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:24,880
Now I'll tell you what my real name is

1351
01:47:25,050 --> 01:47:27,650
- But you can't tell anyone 
- Come on, tell us!

1352
01:47:28,270 --> 01:47:30,270
Valsan

1353
01:47:39,170 --> 01:47:41,170
Oh God! Valsan!

1354
01:47:42,730 --> 01:47:44,730
Don't worry...we will take care of it!

1355
01:47:45,930 --> 01:47:47,930
No! That won't be necessary

1356
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:53,230
- I have a meeting with the Minister this 
evening - Hello, Sir - Hello

1357
01:47:54,370 --> 01:47:56,370
- Sir, your key! 
- Ok

1358
01:47:57,100 --> 01:47:59,100
Alright then!

1359
01:49:01,690 --> 01:49:03,450
Come in, quick!

1360
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:07,560
God! My dear girl!

1361
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:10,020
I am still shaking!

1362
01:49:10,100 --> 01:49:12,100
- You sure this place is ok? 
- Yes

1363
01:49:12,170 --> 01:49:14,650
Like this is your first time! Stop 
playacting!

1364
01:49:14,890 --> 01:49:18,420
I didn't mean that...but why did you ring 
the bell over there?

1365
01:49:18,670 --> 01:49:22,740
- What if there is someone there? 
- That room was vacated this morning

1366
01:49:28,030 --> 01:49:30,530
You are prettier than your pictures!

1367
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:32,640
Really? Thank you!

1368
01:49:39,180 --> 01:49:41,180
Who could that be?

1369
01:49:41,870 --> 01:49:43,870
Go and find out!

1370
01:49:46,130 --> 01:49:48,130
If I am seen here...you know how it is...

1371
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:50,190
Be brave! Open that door!

1372
01:49:58,220 --> 01:50:01,170
You! How dare you behave like this 
with her?

1373
01:50:01,260 --> 01:50:03,260
- Leave me alone! 
- Better lie still!

1374
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:05,840
Oh no! Leave me! Oh no!

1375
01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:09,410
- Leave me! 
- Be quiet!

1376
01:50:09,630 --> 01:50:13,690
- Leave me! My hand! Oh no! My hand! 
- Quiet! Be still!

1377
01:50:13,770 --> 01:50:15,770
Who are you guys? Leave me alone!

1378
01:50:15,850 --> 01:50:17,850
Oh no! Oh no! Leave me!

1379
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:55,840
- Please! 
- Go on! Click!

1380
01:50:58,190 --> 01:51:00,190
- You! Move your hand! 
- What?

1381
01:51:08,540 --> 01:51:11,070
Wow! This place looks nice!

1382
01:51:11,300 --> 01:51:13,620
Next time, your Dad said he is coming 
here for massage therapy

1383
01:51:13,740 --> 01:51:15,520
Really? And how is the payment 
therapy here?

1384
01:51:15,590 --> 01:51:17,590
- It's great too! 
- Then I guess it's ok!

1385
01:51:25,350 --> 01:51:28,500
Honey...this is...Chandy Sir's daughter

1386
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:30,760
Santa

1387
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:56,080
- Santa? 
- Huh?

1388
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:03,400
Santa!

1389
01:52:19,540 --> 01:52:21,960
What's it, Santa? What happened?

1390
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:27,080
We haven't decided that...I will 
be in Dubai soon

1391
01:53:27,260 --> 01:53:29,970
- Yes...I'll be there a few days 
- Who are you talking to?

1392
01:53:30,090 --> 01:53:33,420
True...my daughter and I...

1393
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:35,560
...were just...out

1394
01:53:35,700 --> 01:53:39,610
She had a bit of shopping and stuff

1395
01:53:43,430 --> 01:53:45,870
- Hey! - What? 
- Shall we? - Ya

1396
01:53:46,430 --> 01:53:48,430
I was talking to her

1397
01:54:03,350 --> 01:54:06,910
Every time I was out...I would feel a 
little scared

1398
01:54:11,730 --> 01:54:15,650
Like he was watchng me... 
from somewhere afar...

1399
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:29,950
How...how did you get inside the car? 
Get out!

1400
01:54:30,380 --> 01:54:33,120
- Get out! 
- Why are you so scared?

1401
01:54:33,710 --> 01:54:35,710
I am here to see you, honey

1402
01:54:37,010 --> 01:54:39,010
Are you well...Peeli?

1403
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:44,250
Honey...Peeli!

1404
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:47,420
Peeli...

1405
01:55:42,670 --> 01:55:43,750
- Oh...no...! 
- What happened?

1406
01:55:45,250 --> 01:55:47,730
- Why is there blood on them? 
- I don't know

1407
01:55:48,380 --> 01:55:50,380
Hey! Have you committed murder?

1408
01:55:58,280 --> 01:56:01,450
- Would a body bleed for no reason? 
- Come on, honey

1409
01:56:01,600 --> 01:56:04,370
- Come on, Honey! Come on! 
- He has murdered his father!

1410
01:56:04,450 --> 01:56:07,510
- Is that true? - Have you heard of 
something like this at his age! - True!

1411
01:56:09,820 --> 01:56:12,150
Someone call the Police!

1412
01:56:24,190 --> 01:56:26,110
Hey! Look! Look!

1413
01:56:26,210 --> 01:56:28,210
Come here! Run!

1414
01:56:31,300 --> 01:56:33,830
- Hey! Here you go! 
- What about me, Sir? What about me?

1415
01:56:36,020 --> 01:56:38,020
- There! For you! 
- And me! And me!

1416
01:56:38,300 --> 01:56:39,530
Here! Take it!

1417
01:56:39,660 --> 01:56:42,810
- Hello Granny! How are you? 
- I am well!

1418
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:44,880
(Children talking in background)

1419
01:56:46,550 --> 01:56:47,900
Come!

1420
01:56:52,570 --> 01:56:54,570
Hey! Come here!

1421
01:57:07,240 --> 01:57:10,900
Child...why aren't you eating?

1422
01:57:11,770 --> 01:57:13,770
Let me help you

1423
01:57:15,680 --> 01:57:17,680
Eat, child...go on

1424
01:57:17,940 --> 01:57:20,390
Have some....here

1425
01:57:29,930 --> 01:57:31,930
Come here, child...come

1426
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:36,680
This is the person I told you about

1427
01:58:09,860 --> 01:58:13,720
Here we are...look...did you like it?

1428
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:25,800
That's my daughter...Santa

1429
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:28,920
Four years ago...

1430
01:58:29,330 --> 01:58:31,330
...I lost her and her mother

1431
01:58:33,970 --> 01:58:37,810
See, my child...see what I have got 
for you!

1432
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:40,040
Take it, my child

1433
01:58:40,680 --> 01:58:42,680
Here...some bangles

1434
01:58:42,980 --> 01:58:45,740
She's my own sister's daughter

1435
01:58:46,260 --> 01:58:49,040
What can I do? My brother-in-law 
turned out like that

1436
01:58:50,140 --> 01:58:53,250
Now my brother-in-law is gone and 
so is my sister

1437
01:58:53,650 --> 01:58:56,130
I can take care of my little niece

1438
01:58:56,250 --> 01:58:58,800
Come, child...let's go...Uncle is here 
for you

1439
01:59:05,370 --> 01:59:08,350
Please take good care of my child

1440
01:59:08,570 --> 01:59:11,350
Let her live in comfort...that's all I want

1441
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:18,560
And...I will drop in now and then

1442
01:59:30,850 --> 01:59:33,210
Eventually I turned into their Santa

1443
01:59:33,900 --> 01:59:35,900
I put the past behind me

1444
01:59:38,250 --> 01:59:41,270
But I could never forget my brother

1445
01:59:45,490 --> 01:59:48,340
I just drifted here and there for a while

1446
01:59:50,190 --> 01:59:52,190
I was scared to come back

1447
01:59:53,170 --> 01:59:57,480
And when I did...I first went to the 
orphanage where you were put up

1448
01:59:58,730 --> 02:00:00,730
But...however much I asked... 
they never told me...

1449
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
...where you were

1450
02:00:03,980 --> 02:00:07,390
But I was sure I would meet you again 
some day

1451
02:00:09,020 --> 02:00:12,320
Also, I wasn't sure how Mr Chandy would 
react

1452
02:00:13,200 --> 02:00:15,200
That's why...I never came close to you

1453
02:00:17,610 --> 02:00:20,670
Anyway...you are fine...

1454
02:00:21,530 --> 02:00:23,530
That's all I want

1455
02:00:25,180 --> 02:00:27,180
Alright then...I will see you later, honey

1456
02:00:28,850 --> 02:00:31,940
Etta, Dad is in Dubai right now. He'll be 
back in 2 days

1457
02:00:32,690 --> 02:00:34,690
- Won't you come and meet him 
- Let him get back

1458
02:00:35,100 --> 02:00:37,100
I will come then. Let me leave for now

1459
02:00:37,140 --> 02:00:38,870
- OK? 
-Ok

1460
02:00:39,490 --> 02:00:41,490
- See you, honey 
- Ok

1461
02:00:43,830 --> 02:00:45,430
Oh!

1462
02:00:46,030 --> 02:00:49,260
Hello Dad...yes...when are you getting 
back?

1463
02:00:49,400 --> 02:00:51,290
On the 20th. Want me to get you anything?

1464
02:00:51,350 --> 02:00:54,220
- No! Just get back soon...there is a 
surprise for you. - What surprise?

1465
02:00:54,300 --> 02:00:56,600
- Get back and I'll tell you then 
- ok!

1466
02:00:56,650 --> 02:00:58,650
- Bye! 
- Alright!

1467
02:01:22,530 --> 02:01:26,040
- What is it, Etta? 
- I vacated my room in the morning

1468
02:01:26,170 --> 02:01:28,560
And when I returned, I couldn't 
find another

1469
02:01:28,700 --> 02:01:31,170
It's peak season. All the hotels are full

1470
02:01:31,580 --> 02:01:33,940
Not just me...come here

1471
02:01:48,210 --> 02:01:50,570
I was hunting for a room when I met 
these people

1472
02:01:50,630 --> 02:01:52,630
A friend of mine and his wife...they're 
on their honeymoon

1473
02:01:55,010 --> 02:01:57,010
Etta...I...

1474
02:01:57,240 --> 02:01:59,240
...haven't told anyone here yet

1475
02:02:00,070 --> 02:02:02,070
- When Dad gets back... 
- Please!

1476
02:02:02,700 --> 02:02:04,700
She is really tired

1477
02:02:06,070 --> 02:02:07,600
Honey...

1478
02:02:09,080 --> 02:02:11,080
Can't you just say this girl is your 
friend?

1479
02:02:11,530 --> 02:02:15,020
Just for this night...by morning we will 
find rooms...ok?

1480
02:02:24,040 --> 02:02:27,440
Don't stop now...there's some great beef...

1481
02:02:27,650 --> 02:02:29,650
It's cooked with Chinese potatoes

1482
02:02:29,790 --> 02:02:31,680
You better learn to cook all this

1483
02:02:31,810 --> 02:02:33,650
This is more potato than beef

1484
02:02:33,700 --> 02:02:35,700
I ate up all the beef!

1485
02:02:37,530 --> 02:02:39,230
Stand closer

1486
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:54,190
- Jiji! Is everything set? 
- All set! Just have to fry some papads

1487
02:02:54,330 --> 02:02:56,330
Then make it fast! Dad will be here 
any minute

1488
02:02:56,580 --> 02:02:59,780
Your Dad travels all the time...so what is 
special about today?

1489
02:02:59,870 --> 02:03:03,620
- There's a surprise today. Not just 
for Dad but you too! - What's that?

1490
02:03:03,710 --> 02:03:07,370
- Let Dad get here! - Tell me! 
- Go and fry the papads now!

1491
02:03:07,730 --> 02:03:08,830
A surprise?

1492
02:03:08,930 --> 02:03:12,000
(On tv) 'Newly wed husband found murdered 
in Munnar'

1493
02:03:12,100 --> 02:03:15,920
'The victim of the brutal murder is Ebin, 
a native of Chellanam in Ernakulam'

1494
02:03:16,110 --> 02:03:19,920
- 'Ebin's wife Ruby is in hospital with 
severe injuries' - Child! Come here!

1495
02:03:20,340 --> 02:03:24,330
(On TV) The body was wrapped in plastic... 
- What is it? - Take a look at this!

1496
02:03:26,830 --> 02:03:29,540
'His wife has been brutally attacked too'

1497
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:32,700
'This area has a lot of wild animals'

1498
02:03:33,120 --> 02:03:37,410
'She has been attacked by some animal' 
Child...isn't this the lad that came here?

1499
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:41,800
' 'Has any evidence been collected? 
- Not yet but we are investigating'

1500
02:03:41,900 --> 02:03:43,800
Who did you say they were?

1501
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:46,850
'The body was discovered about 
25 kms away....'

1502
02:03:47,050 --> 02:03:50,350
'...from Munnar town' 
- A...friend... - Your Dad's home

1503
02:03:50,750 --> 02:03:53,590
'Two bodies had earlier been found' 
- Go and open the door - Ok

1504
02:03:53,850 --> 02:03:56,200
'Investigations into those murders...' 
Go and open the door! Go!

1505
02:03:56,260 --> 02:03:59,140
'...have reached nowhere while this new 
body has been found'

1506
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,330
Open!

1507
02:04:11,560 --> 02:04:13,560
Give it!

1508
02:04:14,620 --> 02:04:16,620
You said you had a surprise for me!

1509
02:04:17,350 --> 02:04:19,600
- Give it to me 
- That...Dad...

1510
02:04:19,630 --> 02:04:22,450
It's just that she did all the cooking 
today

1511
02:04:22,550 --> 02:04:25,070
She's made your favourite shrimps with 
mangoes...that's what she meant

1512
02:04:25,260 --> 02:04:26,930
That was the surprise?

1513
02:04:27,030 --> 02:04:28,780
Thank you, dear!

1514
02:04:28,850 --> 02:04:31,310
Come! I am really hungry!

1515
02:04:31,400 --> 02:04:34,280
- I'll change quickly...set the table...ok? 
- Ok

1516
02:04:36,640 --> 02:04:39,440
Child...no one came here...

1517
02:04:39,530 --> 02:04:42,280
...and we know no one. Got it?

1518
02:04:42,550 --> 02:04:44,550
Let's not get dragged into trouble

1519
02:05:05,350 --> 02:05:07,780
- Hello? 
- Hello, honey...it's me!

1520
02:05:08,780 --> 02:05:10,780
Etta...what...is all this?

1521
02:05:11,810 --> 02:05:14,560
- Who killed him? 
- I did

1522
02:05:17,350 --> 02:05:19,350
- I killed him 
- Huh?

1523
02:07:25,470 --> 02:07:27,960
I thought about telling my Dad everything

1524
02:07:33,350 --> 02:07:34,680
But...

1525
02:07:38,900 --> 02:07:40,900
What can I do with this, honey?

1526
02:07:41,790 --> 02:07:44,830
- If you want, I will speak directly to 
your Dad. - Etta...

1527
02:07:44,970 --> 02:07:46,970
Dad doesn't know anything about all this

1528
02:08:05,040 --> 02:08:07,040
- Reached? 
- Yes. Where are you?

1529
02:08:07,640 --> 02:08:09,640
I am right here

1530
02:08:13,810 --> 02:08:15,810
Come, Honey. I want you to meet a friend 
of mine

1531
02:08:17,900 --> 02:08:19,920
Come on!

1532
02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:37,400
Get inside

1533
02:08:37,720 --> 02:08:39,720
Come on...inside!

1534
02:08:45,940 --> 02:08:47,940
This is my sister

1535
02:08:49,660 --> 02:08:52,300
- I am Arya 
- Santa

1536
02:08:58,950 --> 02:09:00,670
Nice, isn't it?

1537
02:09:02,890 --> 02:09:05,420
You can go wait in the car now. 
I'll be right there

1538
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:10,270
Go on! We have some personal stuff to 
discuss. I'll be right there

1539
02:09:16,430 --> 02:09:19,050
- Wedding anniversary celebrations over? 
- Ya

1540
02:09:20,080 --> 02:09:22,080
And where is my treat?

1541
02:09:23,420 --> 02:09:26,770
On my phone, there are pictures of you 
with them

1542
02:09:29,340 --> 02:09:31,750
If I get caught by the Police... 
they'll ask...

1543
02:09:31,890 --> 02:09:34,230
...who you are and what your connection 
is, to this case

1544
02:09:35,500 --> 02:09:37,500
What should I say then, honey?

1545
02:09:39,730 --> 02:09:41,280
Nice, isn't it?

1546
02:10:32,940 --> 02:10:34,940
Here, honey

1547
02:10:35,410 --> 02:10:37,180
Shall we?

1548
02:11:07,060 --> 02:11:10,200
Come, child...here is another friend 
I want you to meet

1549
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:13,320
Come on out!

1550
02:11:34,250 --> 02:11:36,250
- Here 
- Honey...

1551
02:11:36,650 --> 02:11:38,160
Take that from him

1552
02:11:39,320 --> 02:11:41,870
Just take the bag from him and put 
it in the car

1553
02:12:12,700 --> 02:12:15,090
- That's...50...isn't it? 
- Yes

1554
02:12:15,500 --> 02:12:17,500
Please don't trouble me any more

1555
02:12:18,910 --> 02:12:21,330
- Please... 
- Alright, alright....go!

1556
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:31,280
Hello! Your daughter's wedding is next 
week, isn't it?

1557
02:12:33,600 --> 02:12:34,970
I'll be coming

1558
02:12:36,040 --> 02:12:38,040
Your daughter is beautiful!

1559
02:12:38,470 --> 02:12:39,930
I will come

1560
02:12:50,850 --> 02:12:54,280
(in newspaper) 'Businessman commits 
suicide'

1561
02:12:55,780 --> 02:12:57,780
In three murder cases...

1562
02:12:58,240 --> 02:13:00,240
...I could become an accused, Ronnie

1563
02:13:42,290 --> 02:13:43,980
Chandy Sir!

1564
02:13:44,720 --> 02:13:47,670
- Chandy Sir! 
- Ronnie! What's up?

1565
02:13:47,990 --> 02:13:50,850
- I need to meet Chandy Sir 
- They left by noon

1566
02:14:08,720 --> 02:14:10,720
Brother! Do you know where Chandy Sir's 
house is?

1567
02:14:11,150 --> 02:14:14,810
- Kurishinkal Chandy? 
- Go down to the left and then right

1568
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:39,360
Come!

1569
02:14:42,600 --> 02:14:44,600
Sir, where is Santa?

1570
02:14:46,250 --> 02:14:48,990
Ronnie...she told me everything

1571
02:14:49,110 --> 02:14:52,270
- Sir...I need to...see Santa 
- Ronnie...please!

1572
02:14:52,600 --> 02:14:55,740
Leave us alone...for the sake of your 
sister...

1573
02:14:55,830 --> 02:14:57,830
...I am willing to do anything!

1574
02:14:58,230 --> 02:15:00,230
My daughter is everything to me!

1575
02:15:00,560 --> 02:15:04,290
I have no one but her in this entire 
world

1576
02:15:05,390 --> 02:15:08,540
For 12 years now...she had been waiting...

1577
02:15:09,110 --> 02:15:11,110
...for her big brother to come back

1578
02:15:31,110 --> 02:15:33,000
With adopted kids...

1579
02:15:33,060 --> 02:15:35,060
...we are not supposed to...

1580
02:15:35,120 --> 02:15:37,120
...reveal their details to anyone

1581
02:15:37,430 --> 02:15:39,430
But...now...

1582
02:15:44,740 --> 02:15:47,380
Come, honey...come, honey!

1583
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:51,320
Someone call the Police!

1584
02:15:54,680 --> 02:15:57,440
Look at him running away after 
committing murder! Catch him!

1585
02:15:59,940 --> 02:16:03,420
- Stop him! Stop him! - He killed his 
father! - Stop him!

1586
02:16:04,070 --> 02:16:06,070
- Stop him! 
- Stop running!

1587
02:16:07,030 --> 02:16:10,010
- Don't run! 
- Stop him!

1588
02:16:10,420 --> 02:16:13,390
Hey stop! Stop!

1589
02:16:13,500 --> 02:16:16,430
Hey! Don't run! Don't!

1590
02:16:20,640 --> 02:16:22,640
- Oh no! What happened? 
- Come, let's go see! Quick!

1591
02:16:24,700 --> 02:16:28,100
- Oh no! Come on! Come on! 
- Go and see what happened!

1592
02:16:31,430 --> 02:16:34,710
- Oh no! Is he dead?

1593
02:16:39,550 --> 02:16:42,040
Did he fall under?

1594
02:16:42,140 --> 02:16:44,140
Someone check if he is still alive

1595
02:16:46,810 --> 02:16:48,740
It took a lot of effort...

1596
02:16:48,820 --> 02:16:51,730
...for us to bring her back to a 
normal life

1597
02:16:52,330 --> 02:16:54,330
The news of her brother's death...

1598
02:16:54,460 --> 02:16:57,740
...was kept secret from her on the 
doctor's advice

1599
02:16:58,500 --> 02:17:01,400
If she came to know...what if she... 
relapsed...

1600
02:17:02,280 --> 02:17:04,280
That's how much she loved her brother!

1601
02:17:12,090 --> 02:17:14,090
Don't worry, Chandy

1602
02:17:14,390 --> 02:17:16,960
I will talk to her and help her come 
to terms with everything

1603
02:17:17,760 --> 02:17:19,760
She has not knowingly committed 
any wrong

1604
02:17:24,270 --> 02:17:26,100
Ronnie!

1605
02:17:26,180 --> 02:17:28,180
- My...daughter... 
- What is it, Sir?

1606
02:17:28,540 --> 02:17:30,540
Sir...where is Santa?

1607
02:18:02,490 --> 02:18:04,490
It's the full cash, isn't it?

1608
02:18:06,220 --> 02:18:08,220
Hmm...ok...

1609
02:18:17,730 --> 02:18:20,220
What, honey? Are you scared of me?

1610
02:18:20,530 --> 02:18:22,530
Get inside

1611
02:18:30,550 --> 02:18:33,300
I know...you are angry with me

1612
02:18:34,680 --> 02:18:36,680
I will never trouble you again

1613
02:18:38,950 --> 02:18:41,420
Honey...now...

1614
02:18:42,190 --> 02:18:44,190
...will we meet again?

1615
02:18:45,790 --> 02:18:47,150
Guess not

1616
02:18:48,800 --> 02:18:50,800
Alright...we won't

1617
02:18:52,750 --> 02:18:55,610
Let's not meet again!

1618
02:20:12,670 --> 02:20:15,430
Hey! See? Crores!

1619
02:20:15,950 --> 02:20:17,950
Take! Take as much as you want!

1620
02:20:19,060 --> 02:20:21,430
Go on! Tell me! How much do 
you want?

1621
02:20:23,120 --> 02:20:25,120
Come on! Tell me!

1622
02:20:28,340 --> 02:20:31,130
You can tell me what you feel 
is right

1623
02:20:33,320 --> 02:20:36,060
Look...you did all the work...

1624
02:20:36,510 --> 02:20:38,150
...but the idea was mine, right?

1625
02:20:38,230 --> 02:20:41,390
So...if you want...you can take a 10 
or 20...

1626
02:20:41,490 --> 02:20:43,490
...as you like!

1627
02:20:43,980 --> 02:20:45,980
It was God who brought him before me!

1628
02:20:46,150 --> 02:20:48,390
God! Or rather...

1629
02:20:48,420 --> 02:20:50,420
...he is my God!

1630
02:20:52,250 --> 02:20:54,130
Tell me, son...what do you want? Tell me!

1631
02:20:54,150 --> 02:20:57,270
I...want it all!

1632
02:21:47,620 --> 02:21:50,530
- Sir! - Huh? 
- Please try calling again

1633
02:21:58,530 --> 02:22:00,530
It's ringing...she is not picking up

1634
02:24:16,020 --> 02:24:17,250
Hey!

1635
02:24:56,870 --> 02:24:59,090
- Hello? 
- Hello! Dad!

1636
02:24:59,130 --> 02:25:01,110
- Hello! - Dad! 
- Hello!

1637
02:25:02,180 --> 02:25:04,180
Oh no!

1638
02:26:14,860 --> 02:26:17,230
Ronnie! He...Ronnie!

1639
02:26:17,300 --> 02:26:19,900
- Ronnie...he was....no one! 
- I know!

1640
02:26:19,970 --> 02:26:21,970
- I know everything... 
- He...

1641
02:26:22,130 --> 02:26:24,360
It's alright...it's alright!

1642
02:26:25,120 --> 02:26:27,120
Ronnie!

1643
02:26:28,390 --> 02:26:30,390
Ronnie! Ronnie!

1644
02:26:32,400 --> 02:26:34,400
Don't be scared, Santa

1645
02:26:44,600 --> 02:26:45,930
Hello?

1646
02:27:02,930 --> 02:27:04,440
Come!

1647
02:28:28,580 --> 02:28:30,580
Ronnie! Where is my Dad?

1648
02:28:30,730 --> 02:28:33,900
He's in the car, honey. I have packed him 
nice and good!

1649
02:28:34,370 --> 02:28:35,760
Want to see him?

1650
02:28:37,350 --> 02:28:38,690
Come!

1651
02:28:39,790 --> 02:28:40,920
Santa!

1652
02:29:05,140 --> 02:29:06,570
Dad!

1653
02:29:08,190 --> 02:29:10,190
Was my little sister so brave?

1654
02:29:10,620 --> 02:29:12,360
Good girl!

1655
02:29:12,430 --> 02:29:14,430
How come I didn't know that?

1656
02:32:23,730 --> 02:32:24,800
Santa!

1657
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:29,240
Santa!

1658
02:32:42,120 --> 02:32:43,290
Santa!

1659
02:34:13,990 --> 02:34:15,550
Santa, Go!

1660
02:34:16,080 --> 02:34:18,080
I said, go, Santa!

1661
02:35:30,190 --> 02:35:31,480
Hey!

1662
02:35:32,790 --> 02:35:34,120
You!

1663
02:36:26,230 --> 02:36:28,230
Daughter!

1664
02:37:17,850 --> 02:37:20,700
(singing) Happy Birthday to you!

1665
02:37:20,780 --> 02:37:23,790
Happy Birthday to you!

1666
02:37:26,630 --> 02:37:28,630
No! First for the birthday boy!

1667
02:37:33,560 --> 02:37:35,560
- See what I do to you! 
- Oh no!

1668
02:37:35,850 --> 02:37:37,850

02:38:12,850 --> 02:38:15,980
It was this morning that the rotted 
remains...

1680
02:38:16,040 --> 02:38:18,420
...of Shiva was discovered in the interior 
jungles of Munnar'

1681
02:38:18,490 --> 02:38:23,150
This area has had reports of animal attacks 
in the past too

1682
02:38:23,250 --> 02:38:25,920
But the fact that the victim was a dreaded 
criminal...

1683
02:38:25,970 --> 02:38:28,360
...raises suspicions and therefore...

1684
02:38:28,410 --> 02:38:31,590
...the Police have started investigations 
in full swing...Ratheesh

1685
02:38:32,820 --> 02:38:36,500
- Sir! - What? - The media is 
creating a ruckus, Sir!

1686
02:38:37,120 --> 02:38:41,320
Let them! It is their ruckus that creates 
some accountability

1687
02:38:41,350 --> 02:38:43,350
They would like to talk to you, Sir

1688
02:38:43,860 --> 02:38:45,860
This is what you've been saying for a 
long time

1689
02:38:46,240 --> 02:38:48,860
Do you know how long we've been waiting? 
Please talk to us!

1690
02:38:53,330 --> 02:38:55,330
This....is good!

1691
02:38:57,750 --> 02:38:59,750
- Sir! What is the evidence... 
- Only one, please!

1692
02:38:59,990 --> 02:39:02,400
One of you ask, please! How about you?

1693
02:39:02,580 --> 02:39:05,720
- Sir... - What animal was it? And the 
victim is a notorious crinimal

1694
02:39:05,800 --> 02:39:08,760
Which increases the mystery of this 
event. What really happened, Sir?

1695
02:39:09,690 --> 02:39:12,950
This area is prone to wild animal 
attacks

1696
02:39:13,650 --> 02:39:15,560
This incident has taken place a 
couple of weeks ago!

1697
02:39:15,620 --> 02:39:19,160
The body is decomposed...so we are 
unable to give a precise opinion

1698
02:39:19,400 --> 02:39:21,950
The pattern of injuries on his body...

1699
02:39:22,030 --> 02:39:23,930
...and the pattern of attack...

1700
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:25,890
...is consistent with a tiger attack

1701
02:39:26,010 --> 02:39:28,850
He might have encountered the tiger while 
engaging in some illegal activity here

1702
02:39:28,920 --> 02:39:31,820
The locals have reported tiger sightings in 
these parts

1703
02:39:32,010 --> 02:39:35,240
So there is nothing suspicious here. 
He was killed by a tiger for sure

1704
02:39:39,310 --> 02:39:41,540
- Sir! - Yes? 
- Oh, sorry!

1705
02:39:41,970 --> 02:39:43,630
- Here 
- Thank you, Sir. And Sir, I feel...

1706
02:39:43,680 --> 02:39:46,750
...somebody killed him and dumped the body 
here

1707
02:39:46,910 --> 02:39:49,910
- Shall we investigate...? - Stop! 
Is he your Uncle's son or something?

1708
02:39:50,420 --> 02:39:54,490
If people like him stay alive, is it going 
to reduce the petrol-diesel prices?

1709
02:39:54,670 --> 02:39:56,560
- So just carry on with your work 
- But, Sir...

1710
02:39:56,640 --> 02:39:58,640
How could you be so sure it was a tiger?

1711
02:39:59,380 --> 02:40:01,270
Whoever did this...

1712
02:40:01,360 --> 02:40:03,360
...he is a real tiger!

1713
02:41:16,480 --> 02:41:18,480
- Give it to me 
- Here

1714
02:41:22,820 --> 02:41:23,620
Get in

1715
02:41:41,830 --> 02:41:43,830
Come...let's go

1716
02:41:44,240 --> 02:41:46,240
- But... 
- Come on...get inside

1717
02:41:50,740 --> 02:41:52,740
- Goodbye, then 
- Ok

1718
02:41:53,060 --> 02:41:54,130
Ok

1719
02:42:08,430 --> 02:42:10,430
Shall we?

1720
02:42:11,100 --> 02:42:15,160
He may be a Bengali but he also 
deserves some relaxation

1721
02:42:15,310 --> 02:42:17,310
Carry on, then...

1722
02:42:20,040 --> 02:42:22,040
What else!
