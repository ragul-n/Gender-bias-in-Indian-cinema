1
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:34,125
'O tender flower, 
you are my world... forever'

2
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:40,125
'Without withering away, 
you are within me... everywhere'

3
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:46,208
'Protecting you from 
the summer every day'

4
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,333
'Didn't your father stand 
as a shade for you?'

5
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:58,083
'Grow up... gradually.. 
in front of my eyes'

6
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:04,125
'Rise up from my lap, 
to climb on my shoulder'

7
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:09,750
'When paths far away disappeared'

8
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:14,583
'Didn't your father come 
with eyes to guide you?

9
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:18,166
'Doesn't matter if it's scorching hot'

10
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,833
'Doesn't matter if it's raining'

11
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:26,791
'I will always be 
there to protect you'

12
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,375
'If a thorn pricks your feet'

13
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,916
'If your tender 
heart is in pain'

14
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,791
'Your father is here 
to cry for you'

15
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:57,833
'My dear, you should see the 
world you are living in'

16
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:04,041
'Even little things should 
impart knowledge to you'

17
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:10,083
'Mistakes at every stage, 
would be endless lessons for you'

18
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:14,375
'Your father will teach you. 
Won't you listen?'

19
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:22,166
'Even if you fly away, 
searching for a new sky'

20
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:27,875
'You should always come 
back to me as my child'

21
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:34,291
'There's a fire in my heart always, 
as I see you'

22
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,208
'Won't you remember that without 
your father reminding you?'

23
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,083
'Doesn't matter if it's scorching hot'

24
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:45,083
'Doesn't matter if it's raining'

25
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:50,958
'I will always be 
there to protect you'

26
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,250
'If a thorn pricks your feet'

27
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:58,750
'If your tender 
heart is in pain'

28
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,708
'Your father is here 
to cry for you'

29
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:10,375
'To live by the sky'

30
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:16,208
'You should fly every day, 
without falling'

31
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:22,291
'Remember that the world you see 
and live in, is under the sky'

32
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:26,416
'Going far far away'

33
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:57,041
'Even when time falls behind us'

34
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:03,250
'Even when we are covered 
by storms and clouds'

35
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:10,208
'If we stand together, 
whatever may come'

36
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:16,458
'We can face it with the 
same strength, forever'

37
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,041
Sir. 
The rushes are ready.

38
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,333
Okay. I'll come. 
- Sir...

39
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,416
And... Aravind is quite frustrated.

40
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,000
It would be good if 
you speak to him.

41
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,208
What can I speak 
to him about that?

42
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,958
He needs to think only about his programme. 
Is it like that for me?

43
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,583
I have to look at the 
whole picture, you know?

44
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,791
So I may have to be a 
little harsh while talking.

45
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,250
What you're saying is true, sir.

46
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,791
But Aravind is a valuable 
asset of our company.

47
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,666
In case, he puts his paper, 
competitors will snatch him away.

48
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,666
I don't get any kind of 
positive vibes from him.

49
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:52,458
And.. I've been appointed in a position to 
which he should have been promoted, right?

50
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,791
So obviously... 
he'll have an issue regarding that.

51
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,625
It's good if things 
don't escalate.

52
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,375
It would be good if 
you talk to him, sir.

53
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,916
Is Aravind in his cabin? 
- No. He just went out now.

54
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,541
He was really angry 
when he left.

55
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:06,791
Okay.

56
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,250
Hello!

57
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,416
Dad!

58
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,625
This is Kavitha.

59
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,041
What's happening? 
Been long since I heard your voice.

60
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,541
Nothing new here, dear. 
There were workers here since morning.

61
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,083
They left only now.

62
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:46,208
Now I have to take a bath, have food, 
and then go to sleep. What else?

63
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,291
What's special tonight?

64
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,958
What we had for lunch only! 
What else would be special?

65
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,083
How are the kids? 
They are doing good, right?

66
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,541
They are fine!

67
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:57,666
Has Aravind reached?

68
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:00,041
No, Dad. He said he 
will be late today.

69
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,708
I had seen his 
programme last week.

70
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,708
His questions are not sharp at all.

71
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:09,041
Shouldn't he do some homework while 
interviewing a prominent scientist?

72
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,833
You should tell that to him, dear.

73
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,208
Why don't you say it 
directly to your son?

74
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,208
If I say something, 
he will get angry.

75
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,791
But I never get him when I call!

76
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,208
Whenever I call him, 
he is always busy!

77
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,625
Who is it? 
- It's her.

78
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,416
I'll pass the phone to Mom.

79
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,500
I thought you would 
come last week itself.

80
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,375
Yeah, Mom. 
We also had planned it like that.

81
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,875
But Aravind had to go 
to Chennai suddenly.

82
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:35,458
Now some new project 
chief has joined, right?

83
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,875
So he's really busy these days.

84
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,500
Moreover, you can 
come here, right Mom?

85
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,041
It's really strenuous, dear.

86
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,750
It's really difficult to travel 
for 3-4 hours, bending my knees.

87
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:50,125
Is Gautham coming? - Deepu is 
getting married next month, right?

88
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,625
We will be coming then.

89
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,833
Panicker has brought 
a proposal for him.

90
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:58,750
It's a good family. If he is also 
coming, we can go and see the girl.

91
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,916
I don't know if Gautham 
would be coming.

92
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,875
Then what can we do!

93
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,916
Leave all that. 
Where are the kids?

94
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,250
He has gone downstairs to play.

95
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,666
Michu is here. 
She is really helpful, right?

96
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:10,916
What is she doing?

97
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,000
Someone has rung the bell. 
I'll call you back.

98
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,375
Okay, dear.

99
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:19,833
I am leaving.

100
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,791
Dear...

101
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,250
Mom!

102
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,791
He is calling you!

103
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,416
Alby, you be the wicket-keeper.

104
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,625
Hey! You... leg-side!

105
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,166
You stand under that tree!

106
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,958
Hey! You better catch properly. 
Don't drop it.

107
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,500
Throw at the stumps. 
He will be out.

108
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,541
Ashwin, we should win 
at least this match.

109
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,083
Run as soon as you hit.

110
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,625
Abhi! Abhi!

111
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,458
Keeper, move back. 
Ready? Come, let's play.

112
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,041
Out!

113
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,041
I'm not out. 
- Give it. Let me play now.

114
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,208
Move!

115
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,583
I'm not out.

116
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,416
I'm not out. 
That was a trial ball.

117
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,125
I'm not out. 
That was a trial ball.

118
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,875
Sheesh! You are out. 
- Get going!

119
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,750
First ball is always a trial ball. 
- It's not!

120
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,625
It was a trial ball!

121
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,875
You are out. 
Stop your foul play & get going.

122
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,583
Give it, dude. 
Let me bat next. Give it.

123
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,125
Learn to play well first. 
- Don't speak too much. Get going.

124
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,791
Don't mock me. 
The highest score at this ground is mine.

125
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,166
You are the one who's always 
duck out when we play here.

126
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,708
I'm leaving!

127
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:57,291
Get going, man! 
- Go home and do your home work.

128
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,875
Learn to play first. 
- Get lost.

129
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,666
He won't budge if he gets out.

130
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,333
He doesn't know to play!

131
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,166
I told you, right?

132
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,583
Prakash, she asked for a divorce. 
I gave it.

133
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,291
I'm not ready for any compromise 
about the kids. One minute.

134
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:22,083
Veena, speed up the scan report of 
the kids who were in the accident.

135
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,958
Prakash, I'm getting a call. 
I'll call you back.

136
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,916
Hi Gautham. 
- Hi Doctor. This is Dr. Gautham.

137
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,000
Doctor... - Tell me. 
- I need your help.

138
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,791
My friend's son fell from the stairs. 
He hit his head.

139
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,208
I'm just bringing him to the hospital. 
- Bring him fast.

140
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:39,875
Okay Doctor.

141
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,833
Careful with his head's position. 
- Okay Doctor.

142
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:45,250
Okay. How's the child now? Any bleeding? 
- No. No bleeding.

143
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,083
Is he conscious? 
- Actually, no.

144
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,125
Okay. I'll make arrangements. 
- Thanks Doctor.

145
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,166
Okay. Come fast.

146
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,916
Veena, get ready 
for an emergency.

147
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:07,791
Hello?

148
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,208
Sister, this is Greeshma.

149
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,916
Tell me, Doctor.

150
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,625
Dr. Gautham is bringing a patient.

151
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,208
And Dr. Ashok wants 
you in the emergency.

152
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,666
Okay. 
I'll be there.

153
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,083
Good evening, Ma'am.

154
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,041
Careful, please.

155
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,750
What's this, man? You've been at it 
for long! - It will be done now, sir.

156
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,708
What did you tie? 
Move.

157
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,583
Did you tie the fuse? - Yes. 
- Give it to me. Hold this.

158
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,791
Don't point it at my feet. 
Point it here.

159
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,708
He's holding the 
fuse after tying it.

160
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,625
What is this, man? You came to repair 
a fan & ruined all the fuses here!

161
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,125
The wiring is old, right sir?

162
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,833
Old wiring! Don't get me talking!

163
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,125
Why are you getting up every time? 
Sit down.

164
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,333
What's so funny here? 
- Nothing.

165
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,458
Nothing, sir.

166
00:15:58,875 --> 00:15:59,875
Tell me what it is.

167
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,750
We were laughing about 
Sharath's marriage.

168
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,416
Did you meet a girl today as well? 
- I met a girl today, sir.

169
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:05,916
That won't happen. 
- Why?

170
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,500
This uniform is the problem.

171
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:08,791
That's your misconception.

172
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,166
Girls used to be like that earlier. 
Not now.

173
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,791
And.. if you demand 
assets worth One Crore,

174
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,791
a Benz car and a girl who looks 
like Katrina Kaif, it won't happen.

175
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:17,916
Not so much, sir.

176
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,041
Don't leave them. Leave them tomorrow 
morning. Let them sit there.

177
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,708
What about the accident case? 
- We went to the site.

178
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,625
Two people are in trouble there.

179
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,708
One guy is seriously injured 
in the bike accident.

180
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,375
He wasn't wearing a helmet.

181
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:31,791
Sir...

182
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:32,833
ACP Madam.

183
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,708
When you were late, I thought 
you wouldn't be coming, Madam.

184
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,750
A case at Thammanam station. 
Got a little late there.

185
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,291
What is this? 
- The fan is faulty.

186
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,791
Isn't the CI here? 
- He is on leave. Please come.

187
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:54,833
And Madam, I've updated the 
file of that colony case.

188
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,916
Witness statements? - What's the status? 
- I've added it, sir.

189
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,875
Sit down, Alphonse. 
- Thank you, Madam.

190
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,666
Keep it in the car, when I leave. 
- Okay Madam.

191
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,666
I'll be at Kasaba the 
whole day tomorrow.

192
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,083
It's been 3 days 
since I went there.

193
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,916
Madam, we got a phone 
call sometime back.

194
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,333
It was from Asia 
Wellcare Hospital....

195
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,708
... saying that a child abuse 
case has been admitted.

196
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,208
Before we could talk further, 
the call got cut.

197
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,916
And? 
Didn't you call the hospital?

198
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,666
No. We didn't call back, because 
it was a lady who called us.

199
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,666
She said something else as well.

200
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,625
That the hospital staff is trying 
to cover up this incident.

201
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,875
So I thought it would be better if 
we got there & enquire directly.

202
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,916
Because, if this becomes 
a problem tomorrow,

203
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,750
the media would come after us!

204
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,916
Anyway, don't go 
wearing uniforms.

205
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,125
Take two lady officers too.

206
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,083
Sheeba is on sick leave.

207
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,916
Sameera just left after duty. 
We can call her back.

208
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,166
No. Don't call them back now.

209
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,125
It's only a matter of half an hour, right? 
I'll come.

210
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,875
You needn't come, Madam. 
We will go.

211
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,083
It's okay. I just have to 
drop by at home on the way.

212
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,416
That's all. 
- Okay.

213
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:07,958
Madam...

214
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:09,833
Kumar sir is calling you.

215
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:28,541
Madam, this is the list of 
people who were admitted today.

216
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:30,666
Thank you.

217
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,833
Madam, would you like to 
have some coffee or juice?

218
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:41,541
No, thanks.

219
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,333
Yes, come in.

220
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,500
Madam, this is Soni Cherian. 
Nursing superintendent.

221
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:02,041
Soni, was any child abuse 
case reported today?

222
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,666
No.

223
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,333
I had checked the list.

224
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,875
But I thought I'll cross check once more. 
That's all.

225
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:08,958
Okay.

226
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,833
Were any children 
admitted after 5 PM?

227
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
4 kids were admitted in a 
school bus accident case.

228
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,166
Other than that, 
there were no admissions.

229
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,083
It was a lady who 
called the station.

230
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,583
Maybe a prank call.

231
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,666
Other than that, there are 
no such chances.. - What?

232
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,041
No one would call from here. 
- Sir...

233
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,083
Shall I go?

234
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,791
There's an emergency OT case. 
- Okay.

235
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,458
It's not from here, sir.

236
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,541
There aren't any chances for that.

237
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:04,708
Pupils are unequal.

238
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,666
Make IV axis.

239
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,041
Plantar is extensor.

240
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,041
Shift the patient for CT. 
- Sir.

241
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:19,708
Scissors!

242
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,583
Send blood parameters. 
- Okay sir.

243
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:11,708
Doctor...

244
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,666
This doesn't seem 
like an accident.

245
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,333
Someone has beaten this child. 
See!

246
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,000
This can happen even if he 
falls from the stairs, right?

247
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,875
No, Doctor. 
Someone has hit this child.

248
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I know it when I see it.

249
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,541
Is that the priority?

250
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,250
Let us treat him first.

251
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,458
The ones who make anonymous 
calls should be arrested, Madam.

252
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,958
Wasting our time in vain!

253
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,041
But I'm still confused.

254
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,916
Why would anyone report a child 
abuse case, just for fun?

255
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,875
Alphonse, shall we go? 
- Madam, just a minute.

256
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,041
Didn't they say that no 
one else was admitted...

257
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,583
... apart from the 4 kids from the 
school bus accident case?

258
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:11,958
What about this then?

259
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,291
Those 4 children were 
admitted at 5 PM.

260
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,125
This alone was at 7.45 PM.

261
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:21,041
When did that call 
come to our station?

262
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:23,916
When was it? - After 8 o'clock.

263
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:29,250
Why didn't you tell us 
about this patient?

264
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:35,833
That child fell down 
from the steps, Madam.

265
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:38,291
And he was referred by 
our in-house Doctor.

266
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,625
That's why I...

267
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:41,666
Just get me the case sheet now.

268
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:45,208
We don't have any objection in 
giving the case sheet, Madam.

269
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,791
But there are some formalities 
for that. You know that? - Sir..

270
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,833
We don't need the case sheet as of now. 
We can talk to those doctors, right?

271
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:53,541
The Doctor who referred him? 
What's his name?

272
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,875
Doctor Gautham... 
Right Soni?

273
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:00,833
I want to meet him.

274
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,500
What's the condition 
of the child now?

275
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:13,041
Sister, there's a huge rush 
at the casualty. Go there.

276
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:14,875
It's all my responsibility.

277
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:23,541
That is Dr. Gautham.

278
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,125
The guy who's sitting alone?

279
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,500
Yes, sir.

280
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,125
Shall I leave then? 
- Okay.

281
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:30,916
Madam...

282
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:32,875
He is the CCTV of this place.

283
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,750
Shall I go and instigate him?

284
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:35,791
Go!

285
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,041
Hey! Wait! 
- Madam!

286
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,541
I had seen him today. 
Some time back.

287
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,458
At that accident spot.

288
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:47,625
Sharath, go and check.

289
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,708
Move it! 
Move this vehicle.

290
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:53,125
Chetta, pull over.

291
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,541
To that side. 
Come on!

292
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,666
Take it away! 
Come on!

293
00:23:58,416 --> 00:23:59,625
Where are you barging in?

294
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:00,916
Can't you see that it's a block?

295
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:02,500
Sir, we need to go to 
the hospital urgently.

296
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,875
It's a traffic block here. 
You can't go this way! Go back.

297
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,916
It's an emergency situation. 
I'm a doctor.

298
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:09,500
What happened? - Sir, it's an 
accident case. Please understand.

299
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:12,583
A child fell down, sir. 
I have no time to talk! Please, please!

300
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:16,666
Sir, it's a hospital case.

301
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:18,250
It's an emergency. 
- Let them go.

302
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,375
Move this auto to the side.

303
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,708
Move it forward.

304
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,583
But I felt something 
fishy back then itself.

305
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,750
A spelling mistake.

306
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:40,041
You're quite close to this 
family, right Doctor?

307
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:41,416
Yeah.

308
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:42,958
I've known Aravind 
since childhood.

309
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:44,708
Actually, we are school mates.

310
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:46,625
We live in the same apartment.

311
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:51,875
They are from Palakkad.

312
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:54,666
Are you married, Doctor?

313
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:56,541
No.

314
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:01,208
Aren't you the one who 
brought the child here?

315
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:04,208
Yes.

316
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:06,625
How did the child fall?

317
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:16,625
I had to attend a friend's 
bachelor's party.

318
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:18,625
So I left early 
from the hospital.

319
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,125
Achu.. 
Achu!!

320
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:47,250
Achu.. Dear! 
- I think he slipped & fell!

321
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:49,250
Achu! Achu!

322
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:50,416
Achu!

323
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:51,958
Slowly!

324
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:02,458
Kavitha, you come behind.

325
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:05,583
Come here.

326
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:09,458
Careful! 
- I've held him.

327
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:15,541
- Tell me. 
- I need your help.

328
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:17,250
My friend's son fell 
down from the stairs.

329
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:19,666
He hit his head. 
I'm bringing him to the hospital.

330
00:26:20,916 --> 00:26:22,291
Is he conscious?

331
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,458
Actually, no. 
- Okay.

332
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,666
I'll make arrangements. Come fast. 
- Thanks, Doctor.

333
00:26:28,958 --> 00:26:30,041
We'll reach in ten minutes.

334
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:31,958
Could you get Aravind?

335
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:33,833
No. His phone is switched off.

336
00:26:35,791 --> 00:26:36,791
But...

337
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:39,583
What do I tell Aravind 
when he asks me, Gautham!

338
00:26:57,625 --> 00:26:59,041
Vitals are not satisfactory.

339
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:01,083
The child hasn't gained 
consciousness yet.

340
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:03,333
I have suggested 
some blood tests.

341
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:05,500
And we'll do a CT scan also.

342
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,083
Let the results come. 
Don't be tensed.

343
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,041
Doctor is examining him.

344
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:20,958
Don't worry. 
He's the best in town.

345
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:23,666
No point sitting here. 
Let's go to my room.

346
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:24,833
I'll bring her.

347
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:27,958
Come.

348
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:30,458
I need a favour.

349
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:32,708
She is my friend's daughter. 
Mishka.

350
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:34,458
Her brother is admitted here.

351
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:36,500
Hello! 
- Say Hi.

352
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:38,791
She hasn't eaten anything.

353
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:40,666
Can you take her to the canteen and 
get her something? - Yeah, sure!

354
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:41,791
Darling!

355
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:43,708
This is Dr. Ashok's case, right? 
- Yes.

356
00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:45,083
You'll have to take care 
of her for a while.

357
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:46,208
I'll come to the canteen.

358
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:47,208
Why not!

359
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:48,958
Go dear. 
Go with her.

360
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,041
We'll have a blast!

361
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:52,041
Right, dear? 
What do you want?

362
00:27:52,791 --> 00:27:53,791
What does she eat?

363
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:57,250
She.. 
- No. It's okay. I'll handle it. - Thanks.

364
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:00,166
Sweetheart!

365
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:10,333
Sure, sir.

366
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:12,416
I'll call you if 
anything is required.

367
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:15,250
It's the association secretary 
from the apartment.

368
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:16,458
Asking if we need any help.

369
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:18,541
What did the Doctor say?

370
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:22,291
He is okay. 
He has been taken for a CT scan.

371
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:24,500
He will be shifted to a room after that. 
You can see him then.

372
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:27,708
I couldn't get 
through to Aravind.

373
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,750
I also tried many times. 
His phone is switched off.

374
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:35,000
Don't worry. 
I've informed the channel.

375
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:39,791
These are the insurance papers.

376
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:42,708
It's okay even if you sign it, Kavitha. 
Just a formality.

377
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:48,166
Where's my daughter? 
- She's in the canteen.

378
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:49,916
She's fine. 
A nurse is with her.

379
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:53,958
Isn't it better to 
inform your family?

380
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,458
They should also know, right?

381
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,625
It's Aravind... 
- Take it.

382
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:07,791
Hello!

383
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:09,791
Kicha...

384
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,208
When did Aravind reach?

385
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,583
I think around 8.30 PM.

386
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:42,250
Excuse me. Where's the emergency section? 
- This way.

387
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:48,958
I've sent him for CT.

388
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:51,041
Let the results come. 
We'll see.

389
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,625
It may take some time.

390
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,625
Gautham. 
- Doctor, give me a while.

391
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:56,791
Okay.

392
00:29:58,375 --> 00:30:00,625
He... He is fine, right? 
- Dude...

393
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,166
He fell down.

394
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:03,875
That's all?

395
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:05,083
When she called, 
I got scared.

396
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:09,458
He has a slight head injury. 
He hasn't gained consciousness yet.

397
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,375
He's not conscious yet?

398
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,583
He just fell down, right?

399
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:22,208
Kicha...

400
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,708
He is fine.

401
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,250
Kids fall, right?

402
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:45,666
Don't cry. 
He is fine.

403
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:52,125
I spoke to Gautham.

404
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:54,375
He has been sent for scanning.

405
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:02,625
Where were you when this 
incident happened, Aravind?

406
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:04,125
I was in my office.

407
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,750
Where are you working?

408
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,791
I am the creative 
head of Media 10.

409
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:12,250
Do you go to the office 
wearing slippers?

410
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:15,333
I'm coming after going 
home from the office.

411
00:31:18,541 --> 00:31:19,958
Where were you when 
you heard this?

412
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:23,916
I saw Kavitha's messages only when I 
switched on my mobile after getting home.

413
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:25,666
That's when...

414
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:28,750
So your phone was switched off?

415
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,250
Why so?

416
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:34,583
Some issues in the office.

417
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:36,541
And my mobile didn't 
have charge too.

418
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:40,041
What issues in the office?

419
00:31:40,875 --> 00:31:42,875
I am doing a programme there. 
'Meet the Legend'.

420
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:51,708
What about the 3rd cam?

421
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:54,833
That will be good. 
- Prathap one minute.

422
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:57,875
Watch it.

423
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:06,291
What happened?

424
00:32:07,666 --> 00:32:09,666
Prathap, it's not the first 
time this is happening.

425
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:12,625
When you change the timing of my programme 
which was being aired at prime time,

426
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:14,208
shouldn't you discuss 
it with me, at least?

427
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Aravind...

428
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:19,666
Such intellectual programmes 
don't have ratings now.

429
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:21,250
Not just that...

430
00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:23,291
It's such a boring name!

431
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:24,958
'Meet the Legend'. 
Sheesh!

432
00:32:25,208 --> 00:32:26,208
Didn't you think so?

433
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:29,666
I'm the one who named almost 
all the programmes here.

434
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:31,625
No one had any problem then.

435
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:33,583
Did it become a problem after you came? 
- Hey!

436
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:34,791
Come on! 
- Prathap!

437
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:38,125
Actually, am I the issue, 
or my programme?

438
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:40,791
Hey! For that, this 
is not my channel!

439
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:42,666
Aravind!

440
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:45,083
The people who spend money will 
have their own decisions, right?

441
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:46,375
Shouldn't we acknowledge them?

442
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:48,625
Not just that... 
At certain times...

443
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:51,166
... years of experience 
might become a burden.

444
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,958
Many new kids are coming.

445
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:55,083
I was just saying.

446
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:11,666
Your boss? 
Prathap?

447
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:13,416
Give me his number.

448
00:33:27,416 --> 00:33:29,000
It's 85890...

449
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,583
85? 
- 890....

450
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,750
One sec...

451
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,833
Sorry. 
Tell me.

452
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:05,291
I've got the details.

453
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:11,458
I need a copy of the child's 
clinical examination report.

454
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,541
Just enquire about that. 
- Okay.

455
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:17,958
Sharath... 
- Yes, Ma'am.

456
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:19,333
Make it fast.

457
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:28,208
Are you drunk, Aravind?

458
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:33,166
I had gone to the 
club from the office.

459
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,250
Do you booze daily?

460
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:38,041
No. 
Only once in a while.

461
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:40,958
Yeah, I can understand.

462
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:42,875
The pressure in your office.

463
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,291
And family issues... right?

464
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:46,916
Family issues?

465
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:52,083
What family issues?

466
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,500
Sorry Aravind. 
It's because the case is such.

467
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:57,833
I'm sorry.

468
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,500
Can I go now?

469
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:17,666
So that's why 
Dr. Janardanan left from here?

470
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:20,041
Of course! 
Everything is driven by money here, sir.

471
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:22,708
Doctors can go to other hospitals, 
if their salary is reduced.

472
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,000
Nurses can go on strike. 
What about us?

473
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,041
No progress at all, sir.

474
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:30,708
This is the state of the people in uniforms 
like us. It's futile to talk about it.

475
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:33,041
Give me a cigarette. 
- No, sir. I don't smoke.

476
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:36,250
Don't lie to policemen. I saw it 
in your pocket. Give me one!

477
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:38,541
Sorry. 
- No matchbox?

478
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:45,125
But your eyes would reach each and 
every corner here, right Davis?

479
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:47,125
Nothing happens here 
without my knowledge, sir.

480
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:52,208
How is Dr. Gautham?

481
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,833
He is an innocent chap, sir.

482
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:55,458
But he does play around a bit.

483
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:57,333
He can do all that only 
at this age, right?

484
00:35:58,458 --> 00:36:00,333
Come, sit down. 
- No, sir. I'll stand here.

485
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:01,791
Sit down, man!

486
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,375
Where is your house, Davis?

487
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:07,750
At Kozhikode, sir.

488
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,625
I could sense that from your accent. 
Where in Kozhikode?

489
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:10,666
Kozhikode West Hill.

490
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:12,291
I know West Hill. 
Where?

491
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:13,500
Behind the post office.

492
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:15,833
How is this Sister Soni?

493
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:19,250
She's a mystery, sir. 
She's not married yet. It's a long story.

494
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:20,916
I also felt so.

495
00:36:20,958 --> 00:36:23,250
Didn't you see today how she 
complicated that child's case?

496
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,750
You also heard that? 
- Everyone here came to know.

497
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:27,000
How did you know that, Davis?

498
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:28,875
When I was coming out 
of the bathroom,

499
00:36:28,916 --> 00:36:31,416
I heard Doctor and Sister 
talking about this.

500
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:33,416
This is not the first 
time I'm seeing this.

501
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,916
This is definitely child abuse.

502
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,250
They won't do it, Soni.

503
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:38,083
I've known Aravind & 
Kavitha for years.

504
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:41,125
They're not the type who would hit their 
children. Please understand.

505
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:44,458
This is exactly my doubt. 
All of you will bury this.

506
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:46,625
Soni, please. 
Please understand the situation.

507
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,416
Did you see this? 
My Papa did this.

508
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:55,958
I didn't bother telling 
it to anyone, sir.

509
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:59,166
That's good.

510
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:04,125
Yeah. Soni also shared the 
same concern with me.

511
00:37:04,875 --> 00:37:06,250
Did you also feel so, Doctor?

512
00:37:07,416 --> 00:37:09,625
it was difficult to 
confirm it then.

513
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:12,375
Because, the same wounds can be 
caused by falling from the stairs.

514
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:15,625
And the concern then.. was not this. 
It was saving the child's life, right?

515
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:18,458
So... you didn't do 
anything about it?

516
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:20,000
No, I did.

517
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:23,750
How do you know this child's parents?

518
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,208
Aravind is my childhood friend.

519
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:27,958
The family is very close to me.

520
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:30,208
What happened, Doctor?

521
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:31,333
No! Nothing!

522
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,666
Any issue?

523
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:35,416
Then, tell me.

524
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:38,375
Soni had a doubt.

525
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:40,833
Whether there's a 
possibilty of child abuse.

526
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:43,166
When I saw the marks on 
the body of the child,

527
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:45,083
even I also got 
confused for a moment.

528
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:46,416
No way, Doctor.

529
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:48,083
I know this family really well.

530
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:49,208
We are very close friends.

531
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:51,583
I go to Aravind's 
house almost every day.

532
00:37:51,666 --> 00:37:53,041
I've never seen 
such a situation.

533
00:37:53,666 --> 00:37:56,958
As a matter of fact, all of us say that 
Aravind has really pampered his children.

534
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:01,625
Anyway, you check it with them. 
You guys are friends, right?

535
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:03,666
Ashwin might need a surgery.

536
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:06,041
Initiate the insurance 
formalities, if any.

537
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,125
The child's father? 
- He is on his way.

538
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,916
When Dr. Gautham was so confident,

539
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:12,458
I didn't take it seriously.

540
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:13,750
Doctor, there's a call for you.

541
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,666
Who is it? 
- Advocate Prakash.

542
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:18,250
Tell him that I'll 
call him later.

543
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:21,541
Didn't you talk to that 
child's parents about this?

544
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:25,166
I wanted to talk to them.. But I 
had back to back surgeries....

545
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:28,666
So when did this 
actually happen?

546
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:31,750
I was in the OT.

547
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:33,375
It was Soni who informed me.

548
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:43,416
Sister... Something 
happened to Achu...

549
00:38:43,416 --> 00:38:44,625
Come fast, please!

550
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:49,166
Sister!

551
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:26,416
You carry on!

552
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:37,375
Doctor! 
- Wait!

553
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:44,833
Hey!

554
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:46,125
What's the condition?

555
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:48,166
Sir, seizures are not controlled. 
- Okay.

556
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,291
Check the probs.

557
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:52,625
Sister, do the suction.

558
00:39:58,583 --> 00:39:59,666
IV Midaz.

559
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:41,875
Sir, it's status epilepticus.

560
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:44,333
Start Phenytoin infusion.

561
00:41:09,791 --> 00:41:11,125
Saturation is 50.

562
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:25,958
Sir, patient is turning to VT. 
- Make DC ready. - Okay.

563
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:33,541
Three... Two.. One. 
All clear!

564
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:34,958
CPR.

565
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:36,916
1..2...3...4...5...

566
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:38,041
6... 7.. 
- Load adrenalin.

567
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:39,458
9..10..11...12...

568
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:40,541
Clear!

569
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,333
Doctor, saturation 
is still dropping.

570
00:41:56,958 --> 00:41:57,958
Asystole.

571
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,500
Gautham... Achu?

572
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:27,541
Go in.

573
00:42:30,666 --> 00:42:31,791
Achu.. 
- I'll take her.

574
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:34,416
Achu!

575
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:39,208
Achu!

576
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:53,541
Kicha, call him.

577
00:42:55,458 --> 00:42:56,500
Achu!

578
00:42:57,833 --> 00:42:59,291
Kicha, please!

579
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:03,333
You are fine, son!

580
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,500
Kicha, call him!

581
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:15,625
Can't you do anything?

582
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:23,208
Kicha!

583
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:27,833
No! They can!

584
00:43:28,916 --> 00:43:30,041
S... Son!!

585
00:43:39,541 --> 00:43:41,666
Son, wake up!

586
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:45,291
Sonny!

587
00:43:55,375 --> 00:43:56,375
Kavi..!!

588
00:44:03,958 --> 00:44:05,291
What do you think, Doctor?

589
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:07,791
Is there any possibility 
of child abuse?

590
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:11,333
If you ask me so...

591
00:44:11,958 --> 00:44:12,958
I'm not sure.

592
00:44:14,541 --> 00:44:15,541
Leave me.

593
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:27,583
What's the condition 
of that child?

594
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:31,000
Madam, we got a phone 
call some time back.

595
00:44:31,083 --> 00:44:33,000
It was from Asia Wellcare Hospital,

596
00:44:33,041 --> 00:44:35,166
to report that a child abuse 
case has been admitted.

597
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:42,791
But I felt something 
fishy even back then.

598
00:44:43,666 --> 00:44:44,958
Are you married, Doctor?

599
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:46,958
But he does play around a bit.

600
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,916
I don't have any objection in 
giving the case sheet, Madam.

601
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:51,000
But there are some formalities for that. 
Do you know that?

602
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:52,541
We live in the same apartment.

603
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,500
Some issues in the office.

604
00:44:57,541 --> 00:44:59,958
That child fell down 
from the steps, Madam.

605
00:45:42,958 --> 00:45:45,000
Don't put it in a cover. 
It needs to be taken now.

606
00:45:46,458 --> 00:45:47,750
Where's the water? 
- Over there.

607
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:50,666
I'll get it. 
- No, sir.

608
00:45:51,041 --> 00:45:53,041
That child's mother 
is still unconscious.

609
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,083
What do you think?

610
00:45:54,458 --> 00:45:55,583
Is there a case in hand?

611
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:58,166
Yeah. I smell something fishy.

612
00:45:58,458 --> 00:46:00,250
But I need to get 
some more clarity.

613
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:02,791
Do one thing. 
Call Dr. Fariz.

614
00:46:02,875 --> 00:46:03,875
Let him have a look.

615
00:46:04,166 --> 00:46:07,333
We can plan the next step 
according to his observation.

616
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:09,625
Okay sir. 
- Do you want me to call him?

617
00:46:10,125 --> 00:46:11,458
No, sir. 
I'll call him.

618
00:46:11,666 --> 00:46:14,166
And yeah... if the media comes to know, 
it will be complicated.

619
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:15,750
So you need to conclude it soon.

620
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I understand, sir.

621
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,625
Okay? 
- Okay, sir.

622
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:21,833
Sharath...

623
00:46:22,208 --> 00:46:25,250
You know the police surgeon, Dr. Fariz? 
Ask him to come here.

624
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,375
And tell him it's urgent.

625
00:46:27,041 --> 00:46:29,166
You have his number, right? 
- I'll collect it, Ma'am.

626
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,708
Media shouldn't know about 
this incident at any cost.

627
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:37,375
Give strict instructions to 
the hospital authorities.

628
00:46:37,625 --> 00:46:38,958
I've already told them, Madam.

629
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:41,125
Shouldn't we inform 
the child helpline?

630
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:44,583
Wait. Let's see what 
Dr. Fariz's findings are, first.

631
00:46:48,916 --> 00:46:49,916
Mr. Prathap...

632
00:46:50,375 --> 00:46:51,916
This is ACP Latha Siddharth.

633
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,375
I need a help from you.

634
00:46:53,916 --> 00:46:54,916
Are you in the office?

635
00:46:55,375 --> 00:46:57,208
Okay, good. 
My team will be there soon.

636
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,583
Who's on night patrolling today? 
- SI Shinto, Madam.

637
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:07,250
Yes, Ma'am.

638
00:47:08,583 --> 00:47:10,166
I am on patrolling 
at Ernakulam South.

639
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,500
Okay, Ma'am.

640
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I'll go right away.

641
00:47:17,416 --> 00:47:18,666
Send it on WhatsApp.

642
00:47:22,666 --> 00:47:23,666
I'll enquire, Ma'am.

643
00:47:25,583 --> 00:47:26,583
Okay.

644
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:28,833
Madam, I called Fariz sir.

645
00:47:29,041 --> 00:47:30,250
He will reach in half an hour.

646
00:47:30,291 --> 00:47:33,791
Okay, good. Before he reaches, the 
hospital formalities should be completed.

647
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:35,750
Okay, Ma'am. 
I'll talk to Kumar sir.

648
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:38,250
Madam, what I don't 
understand is that...

649
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:41,625
Sister Soni knew that this 
was a child abuse case.

650
00:47:41,708 --> 00:47:43,750
But she didn't tell 
that to us.

651
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:46,333
Sir, it must have been her 
who called our station.

652
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:47,666
That's for sure!

653
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:49,708
She is hiding something.

654
00:47:50,083 --> 00:47:52,208
Shall we interrogate 
her rather roughly?

655
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:58,333
Why did you lie to us, Soni?

656
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,583
I...

657
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:03,333
Wasn't it you who 
called the station?

658
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:06,916
Give me your mobile phone.

659
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Pattern!

660
00:48:34,666 --> 00:48:35,666
Tell me now.

661
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:37,583
Why did you lie to us?

662
00:48:40,041 --> 00:48:41,041
Come on!

663
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Madam...

664
00:48:43,333 --> 00:48:46,416
When I saw the marks on the 
patient's body,

665
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:49,208
I felt that it was child abuse.

666
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:51,083
That's why I called the police.

667
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:55,958
But later when I spoke to 
Dr. Ashok and Dr. Gautham,

668
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,666
I realized that I was mistaken.

669
00:48:59,791 --> 00:49:01,500
Why didn't you say 
this to us earlier?

670
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:07,666
Because you were with 
Kumar sir then...

671
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:14,208
How much did they offer you 
to cover up this case?

672
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:17,000
Oh no! Madam, there's 
nothing like that!

673
00:49:17,625 --> 00:49:20,041
I had a doubt. 
I called the police.

674
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:21,125
That's all!

675
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:24,833
Please believe me!

676
00:49:25,791 --> 00:49:27,750
You're not really 
good at lying, right?

677
00:49:35,666 --> 00:49:37,875
Sir, I was checking 
Dr. Gautham's punching details.

678
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:40,166
When did Doctor go home? 
- At 5.30 PM.

679
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,791
So it's matching with 
his statement, right?

680
00:49:42,791 --> 00:49:44,500
Yes, sir. 
But there's a problem.

681
00:49:44,875 --> 00:49:48,250
For 2 hours during the afternoon, 
that is, from 2.30 PM to 4.30 PM,

682
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:50,583
he had gone out from the hospital, 
and came back.

683
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:51,833
That's okay.

684
00:49:51,833 --> 00:49:54,375
The incident might have 
happened after 6.30 PM.

685
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,541
Anyway, you do one thing. 
Get his details of one week.

686
00:49:57,583 --> 00:49:59,833
Okay, sir. I'll get it. 
- We'll check it later if required.

687
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:03,083
After that, try talking 
to Sister Soni tactfully.

688
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,458
What if we get some lead?

689
00:50:04,541 --> 00:50:06,666
I'll talk to her, sir. 
- Okay. - I'll call you, sir.

690
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,625
I want the punching details of 
Dr. Gautham, for the past one week.

691
00:50:27,708 --> 00:50:31,208
Come, brother... Shouldn't we 
play with our toys?

692
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:49,125
Come, brother!

693
00:51:15,916 --> 00:51:16,958
Should I call the Doctor?

694
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:24,625
See, I know it's the wrong time.

695
00:51:24,791 --> 00:51:28,000
But still... I would like 
to speak to you, Kavitha.

696
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:43,750
Achu!

697
00:51:45,541 --> 00:51:47,083
Achu! 
Son...

698
00:51:47,125 --> 00:51:48,125
Hey! Achu!

699
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:50,833
Open your eyes!

700
00:51:54,041 --> 00:51:55,041
Oh God!

701
00:51:55,875 --> 00:51:56,875
Nothing to worry!

702
00:51:57,958 --> 00:51:58,958
Don't be scared.

703
00:52:01,166 --> 00:52:02,166
God!

704
00:52:03,041 --> 00:52:04,208
Michu, come fast.

705
00:52:05,041 --> 00:52:06,041
Don't worry.

706
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:08,750
You are fine!

707
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,416
Gautham! 
- What is it, Kavitha?

708
00:52:19,833 --> 00:52:21,833
He fell down. 
He's not responding.

709
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:24,208
Come, dear. 
- Let's take him to the hospital.

710
00:52:25,458 --> 00:52:26,458
Careful.

711
00:52:27,625 --> 00:52:28,958
Make it fast, please.

712
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:33,041
Gautham, fast! 
- Yeah! Don't worry!

713
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,666
So you saw Gautham 
at the parking lot?

714
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:49,958
Are you sure?

715
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Yes.

716
00:52:54,208 --> 00:52:56,250
But Gautham said that...

717
00:53:00,916 --> 00:53:03,000
He must be mistaken... right?

718
00:53:04,625 --> 00:53:05,708
What did Gautham say?

719
00:53:07,416 --> 00:53:08,416
Nothing.

720
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:12,583
You take rest.

721
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:28,750
Madam...

722
00:53:29,375 --> 00:53:32,166
One among these two 
people, is lying.

723
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:35,250
And... that Gautham is not 
such a decent person.

724
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:38,125
This is just a thought 
in my police mind.

725
00:53:38,708 --> 00:53:41,333
What if there's something going on 
between Gautham and Kavitha?

726
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:43,875
Maybe... Maybe not...

727
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:45,958
But one thing is clear.

728
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:47,875
Somebody is trying 
to protect someone.

729
00:53:48,791 --> 00:53:51,541
Shall we check the CCTV 
footage of their apartment?

730
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:52,750
We might get a clarity.

731
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:55,500
Exactly. Collect the footage, 
first thing in the morning.

732
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:58,791
And... get the call details 
of the parents and Gautham.

733
00:53:58,958 --> 00:53:59,958
Okay.

734
00:54:01,666 --> 00:54:02,708
Hello! 
- Hello!

735
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:04,958
Yes, Shinto. One second. 
- Okay, Ma'am.

736
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:07,583
I need Soni's call details too. 
- Okay.

737
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:09,083
Tell me.

738
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:10,208
Yes, Ma'am.

739
00:54:10,958 --> 00:54:12,000
That's right.

740
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,583
Okay.

741
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:18,750
Okay, Shinto. 
Thanks.

742
00:54:23,125 --> 00:54:24,625
I think we got him. 
- Is it?

743
00:54:25,416 --> 00:54:27,250
We need to question Aravind once more. 
- Okay.

744
00:54:27,458 --> 00:54:29,375
But... not here. 
- Then?

745
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:32,250
At a place where he wouldn't 
be comfortable at all.

746
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:33,708
Okay Madam.

747
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:35,458
Just give me ten minutes.

748
00:55:25,625 --> 00:55:28,833
Didn't you say that you were in the 
office, when Ashwin fell down?

749
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:30,583
Yes.

750
00:55:31,083 --> 00:55:33,166
That's not what the staff 
in your office said.

751
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:37,916
Didn't you get a call 
this afternoon?

752
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,250
You left from the office as 
soon as you got that call.

753
00:55:44,125 --> 00:55:46,083
The Principal called me 
from my son's school.

754
00:55:46,916 --> 00:55:48,125
What was that call about?

755
00:55:49,541 --> 00:55:51,916
My son fought with another 
boy during the lunch break.

756
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:53,625
She called me to talk about that.

757
00:55:55,208 --> 00:55:56,500
And you went to his school?

758
00:55:58,166 --> 00:55:59,166
Okay.

759
00:55:59,708 --> 00:56:01,583
Now I will connect 
the dots for you.

760
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:15,958
This is not the first time we're 
getting complaints about Ashwin.

761
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:18,958
Just that I didn't 
inform you earlier.

762
00:56:19,208 --> 00:56:21,041
But this time... is the limit.

763
00:56:21,458 --> 00:56:24,166
Who will take responsibility if 
something happens to my son's eye?

764
00:56:24,583 --> 00:56:26,375
We cannot tolerate 
such behaviour!

765
00:56:26,958 --> 00:56:29,750
In that case, it would be better that you 
find some other school for your son.

766
00:56:31,041 --> 00:56:33,041
It's a complete failure 
of your parenting.

767
00:56:45,166 --> 00:56:46,375
What are you going to class for?

768
00:56:46,375 --> 00:56:47,750
What are you going to class for?

769
00:56:47,791 --> 00:56:48,791
Kicha!

770
00:56:49,458 --> 00:56:51,083
You know what he did? 
- What are you doing, Kicha?

771
00:56:51,125 --> 00:56:52,666
He pushed his classmate from the stairs. 
- Leave him.

772
00:56:52,958 --> 00:56:55,208
That boy has six stitches now. 
- Let me ask him.

773
00:56:55,333 --> 00:56:56,708
He won't do all that.

774
00:56:56,833 --> 00:56:58,041
Do you go to class for this? 
- Kicha!

775
00:56:58,333 --> 00:57:00,208
Please, Kicha. 
He's a child, Kicha.

776
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:02,083
What did you do to him?

777
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:04,000
He hit me at my back, Dad. 
- So?

778
00:57:04,041 --> 00:57:05,666
You will push him from the stairs? 
- Kicha, please.

779
00:57:06,416 --> 00:57:07,625
Kicha, don't hit him.

780
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:09,250
You're spoilt because I don't hit you. 
- Oh no!

781
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,166
I'll show you now. 
- Achu!

782
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:12,250
Achu!

783
00:57:12,416 --> 00:57:13,625
Hey!

784
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:14,750
Just...

785
00:57:14,916 --> 00:57:15,916
Achu!

786
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:18,125
Kicha!

787
00:57:18,125 --> 00:57:19,458
What all are you saying?

788
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,083
Are you saying that I 
killed my own son?

789
00:57:22,541 --> 00:57:23,833
Calm down, Aravind.

790
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,291
I am his father, Madam.

791
00:57:31,083 --> 00:57:32,625
A father can never do all this.

792
00:57:34,708 --> 00:57:36,416
You'll realize that 
in some time, Madam.

793
00:57:43,208 --> 00:57:44,208
Okay, Aravind.

794
00:57:44,541 --> 00:57:45,666
Now you tell me.

795
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,208
What happened at school today?

796
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:50,208
I had gone to meet 
the Principal.

797
00:57:51,666 --> 00:57:53,833
But what happened there, 
was not like what you said!

798
00:57:54,875 --> 00:57:57,208
We had warned Ashwin 
many times earlier.

799
00:57:57,458 --> 00:57:59,166
We had even written 
it down on his diary.

800
00:57:59,458 --> 00:58:01,458
Off late, his attitude changed a lot.

801
00:58:02,791 --> 00:58:04,541
It's not enough if we 
alone pay attention.

802
00:58:07,625 --> 00:58:08,750
I'll make him understand.

803
00:58:09,125 --> 00:58:10,250
Okay. 
- He's a child, right?

804
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:12,083
What he did is wrong.

805
00:58:12,583 --> 00:58:14,166
He won't repeat such 
a mistake again.

806
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:16,500
I'll talk to those parents. 
- You must.

807
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,500
Really sorry, Ma'am.

808
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:29,750
Mr. Jackie Chan?

809
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:33,791
What.. 
- Excuse me, sir.

810
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Sorry.

811
00:58:37,791 --> 00:58:39,250
Why did you push that boy down?

812
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,875
He called me a bad word.

813
00:58:41,916 --> 00:58:44,166
If he calls you a bad word? 
Can't you say that to your teacher?

814
00:58:44,208 --> 00:58:45,208
Should you push him down?

815
00:58:46,541 --> 00:58:48,125
It just happened, Dad!

816
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:49,333
It just happened?

817
00:58:53,041 --> 00:58:54,250
You shouldn't do that, okay?

818
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:55,500
You'll become a bad boy then!

819
00:58:56,541 --> 00:58:58,750
Aren't you eating anything? 
You don't have any weight.

820
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,166
It was when I came back to office,

821
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:08,041
that the issue I told 
you earlier, happened.

822
00:59:09,208 --> 00:59:10,500
My mood was really spoiled.

823
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:13,125
I went to the club from there.

824
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:23,125
Kavi...!!

825
00:59:25,291 --> 00:59:26,291
Hey!

826
00:59:50,791 --> 00:59:51,791
Hello?

827
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,875
Madam, he is still hiding something.

828
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:58,666
Look Aravind... 
The police surgeon will reach here soon.

829
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:02,375
If he examines the child, 
all your lies would be uncovered.

830
01:00:15,166 --> 01:00:17,875
Write everything that 
happened, in detail.

831
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,583
If you say the truth now,

832
01:00:21,166 --> 01:00:22,416
maybe I can help you.

833
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,375
Think about your family...

834
01:00:30,458 --> 01:00:31,583
... and do the right thing.

835
01:00:46,666 --> 01:00:48,291
Alphonse, what do you think?

836
01:00:48,833 --> 01:00:50,375
You are quite soft, Madam.

837
01:00:50,458 --> 01:00:53,000
Leave him to me for 10 minutes. 
I'll whack him...

838
01:00:53,125 --> 01:00:54,125
Don't do all that here.

839
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,833
This is a hospital. 
Sharath!

840
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,916
Madam... 
- Did Soni say anything after that?

841
01:00:59,958 --> 01:01:00,958
I spoke to her, Madam.

842
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,583
She is a little tough. 
If Sir could talk to her in his style...

843
01:01:04,291 --> 01:01:05,500
That's what I also said.

844
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:09,833
What about the call list? 
- I'll get it in one hour, sir.

845
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:11,000
Okay, good.

846
01:01:11,041 --> 01:01:13,166
Dr. Gautham, Kavitha, Soni.

847
01:01:13,541 --> 01:01:15,500
I need written statements 
from the three of them.

848
01:01:17,416 --> 01:01:20,416
If we get the mismatch between their 
statements, in their own handwriting,

849
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:22,125
that will make the case stronger.

850
01:01:32,416 --> 01:01:33,833
I think he's breaking down.

851
01:01:34,166 --> 01:01:35,875
We just need the 
confession of one person.

852
01:01:36,458 --> 01:01:38,791
We will close this 
case tonight itself.

853
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:03,041
Do you want to go to jail 
for strangers, dear?

854
01:02:03,541 --> 01:02:04,833
You are intelligent, right?

855
01:02:05,041 --> 01:02:06,250
Think about it.

856
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:20,750
Achu...

857
01:02:25,125 --> 01:02:26,416
Achu... 
- Don't touch him.

858
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,375
I was told that he is fine.

859
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:46,041
Then why isn't he responding?

860
01:02:46,958 --> 01:02:48,000
It will take some time.

861
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:55,875
Achu!

862
01:02:59,875 --> 01:03:01,208
Your husband hit him, right?

863
01:03:02,375 --> 01:03:03,375
No.

864
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,250
Don't be scared. 
Just say the truth when the police comes.

865
01:03:07,375 --> 01:03:09,541
You'll be safe. 
I'll support you.

866
01:03:11,291 --> 01:03:12,291
Police?

867
01:03:12,916 --> 01:03:13,916
Why?

868
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:17,458
Achu fell down from the stairs.

869
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:20,000
Why are you lying like this?

870
01:03:20,916 --> 01:03:22,750
I have seen many 
mothers like you.

871
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:24,041
To save your husband...

872
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:27,958
My mother was also like this.

873
01:03:29,208 --> 01:03:31,500
Do you know how all this will 
affect this child's life?

874
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:33,000
Nurse, what are you saying?

875
01:03:34,708 --> 01:03:36,666
When this happened, 
Aravind wasn't even at home.

876
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:40,583
It was because of me.

877
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:48,500
Hello... Police station.

878
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:51,541
Sister.. Something 
happened to Achu!

879
01:04:52,666 --> 01:04:53,916
Please come fast.

880
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:12,250
Make IV axis.

881
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:17,250
Saturation is fifty.

882
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:31,250
Kavi..!!

883
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Please.

884
01:06:06,416 --> 01:06:08,083
Hey! 
- He's gone!

885
01:06:16,791 --> 01:06:17,875
Hello... Police station.

886
01:06:18,416 --> 01:06:20,458
This is from Asia Wellcare Hospital.

887
01:06:20,958 --> 01:06:22,250
I had called earlier.

888
01:06:22,583 --> 01:06:24,958
Why did you hang up without 
giving any details?

889
01:06:25,916 --> 01:06:26,916
That....

890
01:06:27,041 --> 01:06:29,125
It's all right. 
Madam has left from here.

891
01:06:29,125 --> 01:06:30,458
It's not that. 
Hello!

892
01:06:30,791 --> 01:06:31,791
Hello?

893
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:40,291
We must inform...

894
01:06:44,916 --> 01:06:45,916
Sit down.

895
01:06:51,916 --> 01:06:52,916
Hey!

896
01:06:53,916 --> 01:06:54,916
There's a problem.

897
01:06:56,166 --> 01:06:57,166
What problem?

898
01:07:00,333 --> 01:07:01,333
Hey!

899
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:05,291
Someone has reported to the police 
that Ashwin's is a child abuse case.

900
01:07:06,958 --> 01:07:07,958
Child abuse?

901
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:10,791
Who reported it?

902
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:13,375
I don't know.

903
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:15,583
You should listen 
to me patiently.

904
01:07:16,458 --> 01:07:19,125
If the police have a doubt that 
Ashwin didn't fall from the stairs,

905
01:07:19,416 --> 01:07:21,208
they might arrest Kavitha.

906
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:24,250
Arrest?

907
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:26,791
What all are you saying?

908
01:07:29,458 --> 01:07:30,458
Do one thing.

909
01:07:31,125 --> 01:07:34,458
Can you tell them that I did it? 
- This is not the time to think like that.

910
01:07:34,666 --> 01:07:36,166
We have to tackle the situation.

911
01:07:37,625 --> 01:07:38,791
Hey!

912
01:07:38,875 --> 01:07:40,083
We are humans, right?

913
01:07:40,416 --> 01:07:41,666
Don't we make mistakes?

914
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:43,750
Won't they understand that?

915
01:07:43,791 --> 01:07:46,000
Who's going to understand? 
It's the police who's coming!

916
01:07:46,208 --> 01:07:47,500
Think about Mishka.

917
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:49,333
You know, right?

918
01:07:49,708 --> 01:07:52,333
What will happen if the police and 
media know about such an issue?

919
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,708
You guys will be the 
headlines tomorrow.

920
01:07:56,125 --> 01:07:57,125
But...

921
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:01,250
What are you trying to say? 
I don't understand anything.

922
01:08:01,958 --> 01:08:03,000
What should I do now?

923
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:09,500
We should convince the police that 
Ashwin fell down from the stairs.

924
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:12,250
So?

925
01:08:12,333 --> 01:08:13,333
Hey!

926
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:15,375
There should be marks 
on Ashwin's body,

927
01:08:15,416 --> 01:08:16,958
like he fell down 
from the stairs.

928
01:08:17,875 --> 01:08:18,958
We have to create it.

929
01:08:20,458 --> 01:08:21,541
Marks?

930
01:08:22,791 --> 01:08:23,791
After all this?

931
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:26,000
Are you even human?

932
01:08:28,166 --> 01:08:29,541
I'll handle the police.

933
01:08:34,458 --> 01:08:36,541
Doctor... Police is on the way.

934
01:08:37,416 --> 01:08:38,416
Please!

935
01:08:39,708 --> 01:08:41,208
The body is becoming stiff.

936
01:08:53,333 --> 01:08:54,333
Hey!

937
01:08:56,875 --> 01:08:57,875
Sorry.

938
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:01,750
I am sorry.

939
01:09:06,958 --> 01:09:09,000
I said that because we don't 
have any other option.

940
01:09:13,833 --> 01:09:15,041
Trust me!

941
01:09:16,208 --> 01:09:17,291
Do what I'm saying.

942
01:09:19,583 --> 01:09:20,666
If there is a case,

943
01:09:21,208 --> 01:09:22,666
things will go out of our hand!

944
01:09:28,291 --> 01:09:29,791
This is my family as well, right?

945
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:32,708
Achu was like a son for me!

946
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:39,000
We already have a disaster in our family. 
We can't handle more.

947
01:09:40,041 --> 01:09:41,875
Hey! We don't have much choice!

948
01:09:42,166 --> 01:09:43,500
Don't be so weak.

949
01:09:43,791 --> 01:09:44,791
Trust me!

950
01:09:45,375 --> 01:09:46,375
Trust me!

951
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Trust me!

952
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:49,458
Trust me!

953
01:09:51,833 --> 01:09:53,041
Achu is gone!

954
01:09:54,375 --> 01:09:56,166
Doesn't she need the 
both of you now?

955
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:00,125
Please.

956
01:10:00,416 --> 01:10:01,416
Let's do it.

957
01:10:19,333 --> 01:10:21,958
Don't start the cleaning of the 
child in the ventilator room now.

958
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:24,541
The parents are there now. I'll tell you. 
- Okay Madam.

959
01:10:47,208 --> 01:10:50,166
The easiest way to go to the top 
floor, is the lift on C block.

960
01:10:52,708 --> 01:10:53,708
Soni...

961
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,375
You're sure that there are 
no cameras there, right?

962
01:10:56,416 --> 01:10:58,458
I am sure. Construction 
is going on over there.

963
01:10:59,666 --> 01:11:02,125
You go a little early. 
I'll come after a bit with Aravind.

964
01:11:50,375 --> 01:11:51,375
Wait.

965
01:11:54,791 --> 01:11:55,791
Come.

966
01:12:31,708 --> 01:12:32,750
Aravind!

967
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,500
Come!

968
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:45,250
Wait.

969
01:12:50,166 --> 01:12:51,916
His CT scan has 
already been done.

970
01:12:52,125 --> 01:12:53,958
Nothing should 
happen to his head.

971
01:13:27,791 --> 01:13:28,791
Aravind...

972
01:13:29,625 --> 01:13:30,666
Please.

973
01:13:31,416 --> 01:13:32,416
Lift Achu up.

974
01:15:01,958 --> 01:15:03,458
Doctor, this is not enough.

975
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:06,333
He must be thrown 
with some more force.

976
01:15:06,625 --> 01:15:08,000
What are you talking, Soni?

977
01:15:08,166 --> 01:15:09,541
He will have to do it once more.

978
01:15:13,166 --> 01:15:14,375
There's no other way.

979
01:15:15,416 --> 01:15:16,666
Please.

980
01:15:18,041 --> 01:15:20,291
Whatever happens, I will face it.

981
01:15:20,791 --> 01:15:22,708
I can't hurt him anymore.

982
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,291
Aravindan...

983
01:15:28,583 --> 01:15:29,583
Leave him.

984
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:30,958
Leave him.

985
01:17:38,791 --> 01:17:39,791
Where is our daughter?

986
01:17:40,916 --> 01:17:41,916
She slept.

987
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:46,208
Don't get up. 
Lie down.

988
01:18:09,666 --> 01:18:11,250
Aren't you angry at me?

989
01:18:18,166 --> 01:18:19,833
Say something, Kicha!

990
01:18:28,916 --> 01:18:31,125
Don't be silent like this, please.

991
01:18:36,291 --> 01:18:37,291
Police will come.

992
01:18:39,125 --> 01:18:40,958
They might ask you questions.

993
01:18:48,333 --> 01:18:49,875
I will say everything 
that happened.

994
01:18:50,666 --> 01:18:51,708
Let them take me.

995
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,291
Shouldn't we think about 
our daughter then?

996
01:18:57,875 --> 01:18:59,166
We must think about her.

997
01:19:02,708 --> 01:19:03,958
She needs both of us!

998
01:19:07,041 --> 01:19:08,166
Nothing has happened.

999
01:19:10,208 --> 01:19:11,666
He fell down while playing.

1000
01:19:12,541 --> 01:19:13,541
Just say that.

1001
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:15,666
You should only say that.

1002
01:19:45,708 --> 01:19:46,708
I have told her.

1003
01:19:48,375 --> 01:19:49,625
She will say that...

1004
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:52,208
Achu fell down from the 
steps while playing.

1005
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,500
Hey!

1006
01:19:58,958 --> 01:20:00,833
Kavitha should never 
know what we did.

1007
01:20:38,291 --> 01:20:40,791
Soni Madam... 
Kumar sir is calling you.

1008
01:21:04,875 --> 01:21:05,875
Excuse me.

1009
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:07,625
Come.

1010
01:21:28,916 --> 01:21:30,083
The reports are here, sir.

1011
01:21:33,375 --> 01:21:35,916
Soni, this is Dr. Fariz. 
He is the Police Surgeon.

1012
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:39,708
Doctor wants to examine the child's body. 
Go with him.

1013
01:21:41,458 --> 01:21:42,458
Please come.

1014
01:21:56,583 --> 01:21:57,666
Give me the case sheet.

1015
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,333
Soni... you are Dr. 
Cherian's daughter, right?

1016
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:04,583
Kumar had told me.

1017
01:22:06,416 --> 01:22:08,791
I had come to the hospital 
when Doctor had the stroke.

1018
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:10,916
I didn't see you then.

1019
01:22:16,583 --> 01:22:19,083
What's the reason for your 
doubt in this case, Soni?

1020
01:22:24,166 --> 01:22:26,125
Sir, that's not possible.

1021
01:22:26,583 --> 01:22:27,791
We had checked everything.

1022
01:22:27,916 --> 01:22:28,916
I'll call you.

1023
01:23:27,833 --> 01:23:28,958
Give me the CT scan.

1024
01:23:35,666 --> 01:23:36,666
Doctor...

1025
01:24:11,166 --> 01:24:15,041
A confession that no father 
in this world should write...

1026
01:24:16,375 --> 01:24:17,583
I am trying to write that now.

1027
01:24:18,833 --> 01:24:22,125
The one who is responsible 
for my son's death....

1028
01:24:23,041 --> 01:24:24,041
... is me.

1029
01:24:25,041 --> 01:24:26,041
Me alone.

1030
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,500
How?

1031
01:24:29,208 --> 01:24:30,208
Where?

1032
01:24:30,625 --> 01:24:31,916
I have nothing to say.

1033
01:24:33,166 --> 01:24:34,291
I know one thing.

1034
01:24:34,875 --> 01:24:37,583
I am the one who's 
responsible for his death.

1035
01:24:38,083 --> 01:24:39,083
Me alone.

1036
01:24:40,166 --> 01:24:41,708
It is only when a child is born...

1037
01:24:42,083 --> 01:24:44,041
that a mother and 
father are born.

1038
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:46,291
My son...

1039
01:24:46,625 --> 01:24:47,750
... died some time back.

1040
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,250
That moment...

1041
01:24:50,833 --> 01:24:52,250
I also died somewhere.

1042
01:24:53,666 --> 01:24:56,000
See this only as the dying 
declaration of someone

1043
01:24:56,625 --> 01:24:59,708
who was born to be 
responsible for his death.

1044
01:25:01,041 --> 01:25:03,208
The answer to all your questions...

1045
01:25:04,083 --> 01:25:05,416
... is lying in that room.

1046
01:25:06,166 --> 01:25:07,166
It's me.

1047
01:25:08,375 --> 01:25:10,625
I am the only one 
responsible for all this.

1048
01:25:11,583 --> 01:25:12,583
Aravind.

1049
01:25:13,666 --> 01:25:15,625
I have already told 
everything to sir.

1050
01:25:15,625 --> 01:25:16,708
You know, right?

1051
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:18,916
Now again... 
- Let the report come.

1052
01:25:25,208 --> 01:25:26,500
I examined the child.

1053
01:25:27,166 --> 01:25:28,208
There has been...

1054
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,833
... a cover-up.

1055
01:25:36,208 --> 01:25:38,250
I need to meet the doctor 
who treated the child.

1056
01:25:38,583 --> 01:25:39,583
Okay sir.

1057
01:25:56,958 --> 01:25:59,083
There was an Infarct 
in the child's brain.

1058
01:25:59,833 --> 01:26:02,041
So I gave antiplatelets 
to make it lyse quickly.

1059
01:26:02,541 --> 01:26:03,708
I can see that in the report.

1060
01:26:07,791 --> 01:26:08,791
Well, Doctor...

1061
01:26:09,583 --> 01:26:11,666
Where did you see a clot in this?

1062
01:26:17,083 --> 01:26:18,833
According to this 
scanning report,

1063
01:26:19,041 --> 01:26:20,666
there was no clot in 
the child's brain.

1064
01:26:21,708 --> 01:26:26,083
If you give antiplatelets to such patients, 
their blood flow would increase.

1065
01:26:27,583 --> 01:26:30,333
So... the death might have 
happened due to that.

1066
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:31,500
Right?

1067
01:26:33,125 --> 01:26:36,166
Either, you went wrong in your 
treatment in this case, Doctor.

1068
01:26:37,583 --> 01:26:41,000
Otherwise, you checked 
the wrong CT scan.

1069
01:26:41,791 --> 01:26:45,000
I can only see these two 
possibilities, in this case.

1070
01:26:51,833 --> 01:26:53,708
Sir, I spoke to him.

1071
01:26:54,083 --> 01:26:55,750
Doctor checked the wrong CT scan.

1072
01:26:57,791 --> 01:26:58,791
No, sir.

1073
01:26:58,875 --> 01:27:01,458
There was a slight confusion 
between the ID's of the patients.

1074
01:27:02,833 --> 01:27:04,666
No. I'll see to it that 
there are no problems.

1075
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,375
Sir... You will come soon, right?

1076
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Thank you, sir.

1077
01:27:14,708 --> 01:27:16,958
Did the police confirm that 
it is not child abuse?

1078
01:27:16,958 --> 01:27:17,958
Yes, they did.

1079
01:27:20,833 --> 01:27:23,166
Did you tell them that you 
checked the wrong CT?

1080
01:27:23,208 --> 01:27:25,041
No. I haven't told them. 
- Okay, good.

1081
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:26,833
Don't say anything more.

1082
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,416
I'll deal the rest.

1083
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:35,500
So my son could have 
been saved, is it?

1084
01:27:50,166 --> 01:27:51,166
Kicha!

1085
01:27:52,833 --> 01:27:55,041
Our son could have been saved! 
- Our son!

1086
01:27:58,791 --> 01:28:01,083
Where are you going? 
- I want to see him. - Listen to me.

1087
01:28:01,125 --> 01:28:02,291
Listen to me!

1088
01:28:02,333 --> 01:28:03,833
They will charge a case 
against that doctor.

1089
01:28:03,875 --> 01:28:05,041
There will be a postmortem.

1090
01:28:05,083 --> 01:28:07,041
For that, they need your consent. 
- So?

1091
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:09,541
So you want to tear 
my son apart again?

1092
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,291
Aravind.. 
- Kicha, no!

1093
01:28:12,375 --> 01:28:15,041
Let's take our Achu home.

1094
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:16,625
I know what to do.

1095
01:28:17,166 --> 01:28:18,375
Gautham!

1096
01:28:22,458 --> 01:28:24,666
Madam, our Chairman 
will come now.

1097
01:28:26,625 --> 01:28:29,125
We can discuss, sir. 
- What should we discuss?

1098
01:28:29,166 --> 01:28:31,333
A child's life has been 
lost because of him!

1099
01:28:31,333 --> 01:28:33,416
Sir, we don't know 
what happened, right?

1100
01:28:33,458 --> 01:28:34,791
You don't know? 
I'll let you know!

1101
01:28:34,916 --> 01:28:36,125
We will find that.

1102
01:28:36,375 --> 01:28:38,291
People like him spoil the 
dignity of this profession!

1103
01:28:38,291 --> 01:28:39,583
Then go file a case!

1104
01:28:39,625 --> 01:28:40,750
Hey Doctor, please! 
- We'll see in court!

1105
01:28:40,791 --> 01:28:42,291
Can't he talk decently, Kumar?

1106
01:28:42,333 --> 01:28:45,416
I am a senior surgeon. I am here, 
sacrificing my own family. - I know.

1107
01:28:45,416 --> 01:28:46,833
I do 36 surgeries in a day!

1108
01:28:47,083 --> 01:28:48,833
What is he saying? - We should 
understand the situation, Doctor.

1109
01:28:48,875 --> 01:28:50,208
You are just making calls here. 
- Listen to me.

1110
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
What does he know?

1111
01:28:53,041 --> 01:28:54,833
Ashok, please. 
- I am going crazy here.

1112
01:28:54,833 --> 01:28:56,291
Please. 
The child's father is here.

1113
01:29:00,458 --> 01:29:01,458
Aravind!

1114
01:29:02,166 --> 01:29:03,166
Hey!

1115
01:29:03,833 --> 01:29:04,833
Aravind!

1116
01:29:05,833 --> 01:29:07,083
So all of you are together?

1117
01:29:09,333 --> 01:29:10,458
What do you want now?

1118
01:29:11,208 --> 01:29:12,208
You want to question us?

1119
01:29:12,416 --> 01:29:13,416
You want to hang us?

1120
01:29:13,916 --> 01:29:14,916
Do whatever you want.

1121
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:17,958
But... can you give 
my son back to me?

1122
01:29:20,041 --> 01:29:21,041
Can you give me?

1123
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
You killed my son, right?

1124
01:29:24,875 --> 01:29:25,875
Not you!

1125
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,000
It was me.

1126
01:29:27,833 --> 01:29:28,833
It wasn't me either.

1127
01:29:29,291 --> 01:29:30,291
It was her.

1128
01:29:30,333 --> 01:29:31,333
Right?

1129
01:29:31,416 --> 01:29:32,791
So everyone killed my son!

1130
01:29:34,833 --> 01:29:37,666
But I won't allow anyone 
to tear apart my son now.

1131
01:29:37,833 --> 01:29:39,125
I won't allow anyone!

1132
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:40,833
I won't allow anyone to do that!

1133
01:29:43,125 --> 01:29:44,125
Where is my daughter?

1134
01:29:45,541 --> 01:29:46,833
Did all of you kill her too?

1135
01:29:47,208 --> 01:29:48,833
Aravind! Hey!

1136
01:29:49,666 --> 01:29:51,458
Don't stay there. 
Come with me.

1137
01:31:06,833 --> 01:31:08,125
What do we tell her now?

1138
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:22,500
Even if we tear him apart now,

1139
01:31:23,458 --> 01:31:24,750
we're not going to get him back.

1140
01:31:25,916 --> 01:31:28,875
There's no point in fighting a case.

1141
01:31:30,208 --> 01:31:33,666
We don't want another family 
to shed tears, because of us.

1142
01:31:34,875 --> 01:31:35,958
Let it be, dude.

1143
01:31:38,083 --> 01:31:39,208
How is your health?

1144
01:31:39,791 --> 01:31:40,833
Fine, Doctor.

1145
01:31:41,125 --> 01:31:42,291
Then what's wrong?

1146
01:31:43,333 --> 01:31:46,416
No, Doctor. 
I have a gut feeling.

1147
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:48,666
That we're missing out something.

1148
01:31:50,625 --> 01:31:52,166
As you said...

1149
01:31:52,583 --> 01:31:55,750
that child would have died due 
to medical negligence indeed.

1150
01:31:56,416 --> 01:31:59,416
We don't have any evidence to 
prove that it's child abuse, either.

1151
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:01,166
I mean, conclusive evidence.

1152
01:32:01,291 --> 01:32:03,958
But I still feel, they are 
hiding something from us.

1153
01:32:04,333 --> 01:32:05,916
Alphonse, what do you think?

1154
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:09,166
Shall we question the parents 
of that child again?

1155
01:32:11,083 --> 01:32:12,208
Leave it.

1156
01:32:12,208 --> 01:32:14,125
Why should you go 
behind this case now?

1157
01:32:14,416 --> 01:32:16,541
Even if they have 
done something wrong,

1158
01:32:16,875 --> 01:32:19,791
will they get a bigger punishment 
than losing their own son?

1159
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:23,458
We can charge a case against 
that Doctor if we want to.

1160
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:24,625
What's the point?

1161
01:32:24,666 --> 01:32:27,166
Those parents will have to do the 
rounds at courts for a long time.

1162
01:32:27,166 --> 01:32:28,208
Is that necessary?

1163
01:32:28,791 --> 01:32:30,625
What sir said is right, Madam.

1164
01:32:31,083 --> 01:32:33,333
We saw the condition 
of that family, right?

1165
01:32:34,041 --> 01:32:35,041
Let's forget it.

1166
01:32:35,833 --> 01:32:39,000
And we still have many other 
cases to solve, right?

1167
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:39,958
Yes.

1168
01:32:39,958 --> 01:32:42,875
I am sure. Your Commissioner would 
also have the same opinion.

1169
01:32:45,583 --> 01:32:46,583
Come.

1170
01:33:14,791 --> 01:33:16,458
Michu, don't you want 
to see the fish?

1171
01:33:16,625 --> 01:33:17,833
Put your head in the water.

1172
01:33:19,166 --> 01:33:21,666
If you don't put it quickly, 
I'll push your head in.

1173
01:33:22,166 --> 01:33:24,791
No. I'll see it from here.

1174
01:33:25,125 --> 01:33:27,625
Leave me, brother. 
Leave me!

1175
01:33:27,791 --> 01:33:29,625
Listen to me. 
It's a great feeling.

1176
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:31,541
Look, Michu!

1177
01:33:32,916 --> 01:33:34,750
Stay down for some more time.

1178
01:33:37,208 --> 01:33:38,291
Hey!

1179
01:33:38,916 --> 01:33:40,416
What are you doing there, Achu?

1180
01:33:45,208 --> 01:33:46,208
Hey!

1181
01:33:47,541 --> 01:33:49,125
What are you doing?

1182
01:33:51,166 --> 01:33:52,333
She's a little child, right?

1183
01:33:53,291 --> 01:33:54,291
Don't worry, dear.

1184
01:33:54,333 --> 01:33:56,416
How many times have I told 
you not to play in water?

1185
01:33:56,458 --> 01:33:58,041
If something had happened to her, 
suffocating in water?

1186
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:00,500
It's nothing, dear.

1187
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:05,750
Nothing, dear.

1188
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:15,500
What is this?

1189
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
What is this?

1190
01:34:18,166 --> 01:34:19,750
Why did you hit me, mom?

1191
01:34:19,791 --> 01:34:21,916
I was showing her the fish.

1192
01:34:22,291 --> 01:34:24,000
What? 
You and your damn fish!!

1193
01:34:35,458 --> 01:34:36,458
Achu!

1194
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:42,750
Hey!

1195
01:34:44,333 --> 01:34:45,333
Achu!

1196
01:35:48,291 --> 01:35:50,166
Hey! I told you 
not to take that.

1197
01:35:51,375 --> 01:35:53,375
I'll hit you really hard 
if you draw on the walls.

1198
01:35:54,416 --> 01:35:56,375
If you be naughty, 
you'll get it from me!

1199
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:58,833
You'll get it from me!

1200
01:36:00,083 --> 01:36:02,708
Kukku, get up only 
after eating all this.

1201
01:36:03,458 --> 01:36:04,958
Enough of playing. 
Go and study!
