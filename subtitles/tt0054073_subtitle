00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,056
Young lady!

20
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,850
- Yes?
- Come here.

21
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,814
Tell your father
he'll soon owe for two months.

22
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,024
This can't go on!

23
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,568
- I'll tell him.
- You do that.

24
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,264
Again?

25
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,724
Just this once, Bansi.

26
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,977
I’ve just got to shave.

27
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,480
You and your father
are shaving me clean!

28
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,024
Any idea how much you owe?

29
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,112
Just one blade.

30
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,169
“Dark-skinned girl”?
What does it mean?

31
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,965
That her pigment is a bit dark?
Goodness me!

32
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,384
Stop going on! Go teach!

33
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,595
You don't get my point!

34
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,472
What if she suddenly returns
after tutoring?

35
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,142
She'll be hurt if she hears this.

36
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,853
Such a responsible girl!

37
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,773
Pursuing her M.A.,
tutoring two students,

38
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,235
and bringing in
40 rupees a month -

39
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,404
Are you still rattling on?

40
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:48,700
You talk and talk
but don't really care to know.

41
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:53,330
I heard at the committee meeting
they'll be starting evictions again

42
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,041
and cutting off money
for the school.

43
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,669
Shall I bring a cushion
so you can ramble on?

44
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,546
Goodness me!

45
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,224
Goodness me!

46
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,310
Your sandals are broken!

47
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,604
<i>I'll</i> get a new pair.

48
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,982
Goodness me!

49
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,944
Sir, your contribution
for our refugee camp?

50
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,363
I'm glad I ran into you.

51
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,200
You're involved in theater.
That's wonderful.

52
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:34,579
The tragic theme of your play
is a noble one,

53
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:38,208
but why must we be
kept awake at night

54
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,543
by all the racket?

55
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,965
<i>The bee flies buzzing into the room</i>

56
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,138
<i>What news does it bring?</i>

57
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,140
Neeta!

58
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,925
What?

59
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,761
Stop destroying that bolster!

60
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,014
You're late for college! Go!

61
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,807
I’m going!

62
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,962
Hey there.

63
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,758
A love letter
at your advanced age?

64
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,761
Give it back!

65
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,472
Let me read it!

66
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,391
“When we first met,
I didn't really see you.

67
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,852
I thought you quite ordinary.

68
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,272
Now I can see...

69
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,275
you're a cloud-capped star,

70
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:13,321
veiled by circumstance,

71
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:18,118
your brilliance dimmed
by a clouded sky...”

72
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,203
What tripe!

73
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,956
Let me see the name!
“Sanat”?

74
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,668
That idiot? I haven't seen him
around in a while.

75
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,171
Poking your nose
into a girl's personal affairs!

76
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,965
“Personal”?

77
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,635
If you're a person,
someday I'll be a genius!

78
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:39,639
You know you are one.
That's why you're so arrogant.

79
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,604
If only Bansi the grocer
understood

80
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,982
that I'm a genius.

81
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,652
How about some money?
My beard is itching bad.

82
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,781
- How much?
- Two annas for now.

83
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,825
Or maybe four.

84
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,287
Or maybe eight.

85
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,497
I'll buy some flavored tobacco.

86
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,292
Why not a whole tenner?

87
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,128
You got paid today, right?

88
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,091
Why don't you get a job?

89
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,844
That's unseemly for an artiste.

90
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,638
Another two years...

91
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,808
and money will be
raining down from the sky.

92
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:29,689
You know what Amir Khan gets
for a single performance?

93
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,821
Remember what I said
about the tenner!

94
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,246
Ma, you know
Manasi from my college,

95
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,373
the dark-skinned girl?

96
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,126
She has a sari
with milkmaids on it.

97
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,878
Not that again!

98
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,880
Don't listen to her!

99
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:57,550
Tomorrow's our final soccer match.

100
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,094
The other team has cleats now.

101
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,139
I can't wear
this same ugly sari every day.

102
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,642
Her Highness has been
in the same class

103
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,644
for three years now.

104
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,062
Why even bother?

105
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:12,440
<i>I mus!</i> have shoes
with cleats by tomorrow!

106
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,235
It's hard just providing
two meals a day,

107
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,570
yet the demands never stop.

108
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,615
By month's end
it's one dish per meal...

109
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,785
It's the first of the month!
Neeta got paid!

110
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,454
Neeta!
- No, me first!

111
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,133
These spikes are great!

112
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,261
See how light they are?

113
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,972
You didn't buy your sandals?

114
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:48,810
Later. I got material
for brother's shirt instead.

115
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,145
- Guess who I just spotted.
- Who?

116
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,816
I recognized him at once,
even after all these years.

117
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:58,444
- It's Sanat, Father's student!
- Should I call him?

118
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,488
Hey, Sanat!

119
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,417
Don't you recognize us?

120
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,127
Montu?

121
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,138
What are you staring at?

122
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:30,393
You've changed
these last few years.

123
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,812
You were just a little girl...

124
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,939
- And now...?
- Neeta.

125
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:44,115
Your letters keep coming,
but you never visit. Why?

126
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,492
I haven't forgotten your handwriting.

127
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,329
I pass your letters on to Neeta.

128
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:53,499
She's hardly at home,
what with college and tutoring.

129
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,088
We should head home.
Ma will be angry.

130
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,050
Why don't you come too?

131
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,594
Montu, come on.
- Coming.

132
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,059
Geeta's grown up
to be a lovely girl.

133
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:16,606
Very lovely. Too bad
she can't have decent clothes.

134
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,608
- Neeta.
- Yes?

135
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,527
I must photograph
my diagrams this month.

136
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,571
I need some money.

137
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,282
This month's money is all gone.

138
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:30,703
I can't ever give my siblings
the things they want.

139
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,539
And I still come to you
with my woes!

140
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,541
I feel so powerless.

141
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:39,712
This is your struggle.
Can't I share it with you?

142
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:47,053
I'll find a way
to give you a bit next month.

143
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,681
But do come by one day.

144
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,184
Father's always talking about you.

145
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,396
I'll do that the moment
I have some money.

146
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,147
Good-bye.

147
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,874
She spent it all!

148
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,584
Stop that!

149
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,921
Your darling daughter
is always throwing money away!

150
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,715
It's her own money!

151
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,968
The brazen hussy!

152
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,262
She just runs around
squandering money,

153
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,722
enough for
a whole month's groceries.

154
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,933
I should be contributing more.

155
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,436
How can I say anything?

156
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,564
No one sees what I go through.

157
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,941
No one understands.

158
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,735
Such ingratitude!

159
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,946
Ingrates, every one of you!

160
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,640
Aren't you going to eat?

161
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,978
I’m not feeling well.

162
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,022
Listen...

163
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,442
don't be angry with Ma.

164
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:29,447
The weight of poverty
has crushed her soul.

165
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,532
I’m not angry.

166
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:36,037
Remember that poem by Yeats?

167
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,458
“Sing on:
somewhere at some new moon

168
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:44,128
we shall learn
that sleeping is not death...

169
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:47,965
hearing the whole earth
change its tune.”

170
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,345
My head's pounding.

171
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,388
Goodness me!

172
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,854
Here's another good-for-nothing lout!

173
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,981
Our saint among sinners.

174
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,359
What's this long hair?

175
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,319
Cut it off!

176
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,456
Nice material you bought!

177
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,042
You definitely have good taste.

178
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,213
Going to bed already?
No dinner?

179
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,632
- No.
- Why not?

180
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,594
Ma must have said something.

181
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,389
Let people talk.
You do what you want.

182
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,307
Make that your motto.

183
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,059
Leave me alone.

184
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,395
What's this?
Eyes full of tears?

185
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,523
Ready to spill over
at the slightest provocation.

186
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,943
Very well.
I'll cast a spell. All right?

187
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,070
I don't feel good.

188
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,656
Then I'll say a prayer.

189
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:02,498
“Mother, your little girl
wants to catch the moon.

190
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,961
She says 'Ganush' for 'Ganesh.'

191
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,925
She doesn't understand a thing.

192
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,637
Your little girl is such a child!”

193
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,556
Come on, get up.

194
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,521
Don't forget:
I need a tenner tomorrow.

195
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,607
There's nothing left.

196
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,652
You spent it all?
Next month, then.

197
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,115
Starting next month
it all goes straight to Ma.

198
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:40,995
Idiot! Whoever gives their money
away is a full-scale idiot!

199
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,790
Look at that ninny.

200
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,961
Going somewhere this late
all decked out?

201
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,048
I couldn't wait till morning.

202
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,550
I just had to see how I look.

203
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,888
Slightly bovine.

204
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,278
There's pleasure in practice.

205
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,385
Bansi.

206
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,221
Not now. I'm very busy.

207
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,807
Send our bill for last month.

208
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,227
You're going to pay UP?

209
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,397
Anything else you'd like?
Some soap?

210
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,941
Just the bill.

211
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,901
Very well.

212
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,451
Geeta?

213
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,579
Aren't you going to class?

214
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:59,925
All these novels and movies
when you're failing in school!

215
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:04,180
There's never anything
in this hell-hole of poverty!

216
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,725
Then why not create
a little paradise here?

217
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:11,395
You can all parade around
like angels,

218
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:15,399
while I lie back twiddling my thumbs

219
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,068
and smelling the celestial roses!

220
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,828
Neeta, we need you desperately.

221
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,956
You and Shankar
have to sing at our function.

222
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,792
I’ve given up singing,

223
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,836
and Shankar's maestro
won't give him permission.

224
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:41,217
We at least have to discuss
whom to invite and other plans.

225
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:44,553
Fine. I'll stop by the library.

226
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,681
Shanti, seems your rehearsals
are going well.

227
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,892
We're in a real fix.

228
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,019
We need a good stage manager.

229
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,104
You need no such thing!

230
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,650
It's a terrible situation
you've created as it is!

231
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,777
Goodness me!

232
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,290
- Ma.
- What?

233
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,709
My tutoring pay.

234
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,049
All of it?

235
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,969
I asked Bansi to send his bill.

236
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,346
I always have
to endure his scolding.

237
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,974
Neeta.

238
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,312
You keep five rupees.

239
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,690
Pocket money.

240
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,694
Have you no shame,
sponging off your father?

241
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:45,114
Your sister works
all day long to pay your bills

242
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:48,534
while you sing
and toss your locks around!

243
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:52,496
For money, Mother, for money!
I'll be earning money too.

244
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:56,083
I’ve been getting lots of inquiries
since that radio audition.

245
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,586
My maestro is furious!

246
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:03,591
He'll let me perform after
two more years of solid practice.

247
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:07,553
Isn't he the one
with the hennaed beard?

248
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:11,056
Why not just hang on
like a midget

249
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,350
and swing from that?

250
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:17,187
What able-bodied son sits at home?
Go set up a shop!

251
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,523
- I’m an artiste.
- Quiet!

252
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:23,068
My bread doesn't come cheap.

253
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:27,406
I can't look your sisters in the face.

254
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:32,369
No more free meals!
If you want to eat, you can pay!

255
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,277
Running off without eating?

256
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:08,197
Did you tell Ma
I'm taking advantage here?

257
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:11,325
“Ma, your little boy
doesn't understand a thing.

258
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,619
Your little boy is such a child.”

259
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:14,912
Cut it out.

260
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,872
Why pay attention to nonsense?

261
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:20,250
Why ruin your whole future
over a few words today?

262
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,546
Just grit your teeth
for two more years.

263
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,676
Here's something for now.

264
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:39,269
Neeta, you're the only one
who really appreciates me.

265
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:42,773
In your hurry
did you forget about tomorrow?

266
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,608
What's tomorrow?

267
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,486
Jagatdhatri Puja.

268
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,364
So it's your birthday!

269
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,826
Father's taking me out
like in the old days.

270
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,828
He is? Where?

271
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,539
It's not decided yet. Somewhere.

272
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,333
Then I'm coming too.

273
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:05,004
But I know he'll make
an awful face and say -

274
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:08,257
- You're such a child!
- I won't listen to him.

275
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:11,844
I know he'll say no.
Come on, let's eat.

276
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,314
Why did you bring us here?

277
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,318
Come along.

278
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,117
Sunrise.

279
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,601
Give me that.

280
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:08,150
Didn't Keats have a verse...

281
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,737
“The poetry of the earth
is never dead.”

282
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,199
These rice fields -

283
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,160
it costs nothing
to admire their beauty.

284
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,788
So what if we have no money?

285
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,873
These fields are here.

286
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,459
Want to know the truth?

287
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,837
Living is an art.

288
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,090
You'll get indigestion.

289
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,926
At the rate you're going -

290
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:36,386
Look at our lives -

291
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:39,056
Will you be a glutton
all your life?

292
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:42,768
Ignorant lad!
You mustn't say such things.

293
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,771
Couldn't we have a bit...?

294
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,234
Here.

295
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,862
Neeta, you think
there's some water around?

296
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:57,324
I think there's water nearby.

297
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,701
Don't you?

298
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,427
Sir?

299
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,306
Your contribution
is three months overdue.

300
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,475
Please give us at least something.

301
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,772
Come by tomorrow.
I'll see what I can do.

302
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,483
- Tomorrow morning?
- Yes.

303
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,653
Listen.

304
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:39,324
I don't hear your voice
in all the rehearsal mayhem.

305
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,993
What are you up to?

306
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:42,369
I quit.

307
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,413
I wasn't getting any roles.

308
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:46,081
Roles?

309
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,168
As in acting? You're an actor?

310
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,587
Sir.

311
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,341
Who are you?

312
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,344
Sanat, sir.

313
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,889
Sanat!

314
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:08,020
Didn't you place second
in pure physics this year?

315
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,771
Yes, sir.

316
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:14,026
Who told me that?
Ah, it was Neeta.

317
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,862
Yes, we run into each other
sometimes.

318
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:20,240
I didn't even know
you had relocated here.

319
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,160
Ma'am, what's happened?

320
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,370
You look so pale and gaunt.

321
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,623
I'll make some tea.

322
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,045
What are your plans now?

323
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:36,548
I’m looking for a scholarship
to do doctoral research.

324
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,217
Monkey!

325
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:44,348
A Doctor of Science?
- Yes.

326
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,642
PhD's are all too common.

327
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:48,685
Swine!

328
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,485
What's your thesis on?

329
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,738
The Reynolds number
of the supersonic vibration

330
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,949
of the lower Gangetic plain.

331
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,201
- Ape!
- What?

332
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,663
Not you. I mean Shankar.

333
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:10,165
I was comparing you two.

334
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,252
He's done nothing with his life.

335
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,588
Son, come have a bite.

336
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,718
- Go on.
- Yes, sir.

337
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:36,942
You're here?

338
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,364
Immersed in your studies?

339
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:47,160
There's no other way
forward in life.

340
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,916
What a beautiful spot!

341
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,711
Who are these two?

342
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:15,731
Geeta.

343
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,649
I have no time.

344
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,235
Take some tea to Sanat.

345
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,696
Sanat's here?

346
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:26,992
Wicked girl!

347
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:46,345
What are you staring at?
Take it!

348
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,180
I’m late.

349
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,934
How can you sit indoors
all evening?

350
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,853
I’d suffocate!

351
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,899
See you later.

352
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,738
Drink your tea.

353
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:08,241
I can be late for tutoring
since you've come by.

354
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:10,535
Let's go for a walk.

355
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:12,746
What's the matter?
- Huh?

356
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,040
- Anything wrong?
- No.

357
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,959
Let's go for a walk.

358
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:20,170
I just suggested that.

359
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,714
Miles away, weren't you?

360
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,383
<i>Hello?</i>

361
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,553
Anyone home?

362
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,722
Where is everyone?
- Out!

363
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,474
Anyone home?

364
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:36,019
You just walk in here?
Get out this minute!

365
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:40,232
Miserable wretch!
Sauntering in here in broad daylight!

366
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:43,068
Goodness me!

367
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:47,364
Swami, how are you?

368
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:49,199
The nerve!

369
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,910
Come in.

370
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:57,374
Wife, this is the famous swami
I told you about.

371
00:31:57,499 --> 00:32:00,168
- When?
- I'll be going.

372
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:03,922
Bringing home vagabonds
when you can't feed yourself!

373
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:08,427
The beginnings always
a bit troublesome, sir.

374
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,721
Dean"

375
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:16,643
he has a beautiful voice.
You'll be spellbound.

376
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,229
If you ever bring home
another scoundrel...!

377
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,023
Wait outside!

378
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:24,568
I'll be right there!

379
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,909
- Neeta?
- Yes, Father?

380
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,288
Quick, bring me a rupee.

381
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,750
Swami?

382
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,883
Not a word to your mother.

383
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:50,552
Sanat, I'm busy now.

384
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:54,806
I have some tutoring
to do in Selimpur.

385
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,475
Let's go.

386
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:17,829
Ma, we're going for a walk,

387
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,040
and I have tutoring after that.

388
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,584
- Good-bye, ma'am.
- Good-bye, son.

389
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,109
I’d better tell you:

390
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,779
I can't manage without a job.

391
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:53,782
No, you have to do your research.

392
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,910
But I can't seem
to get a scholarship.

393
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,579
I had to interrupt
my regular studies.

394
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:02,457
It's created an awful situation.

395
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,543
Just a few more months.

396
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,461
And then?

397
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,547
I'll graduate...

398
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,216
and get a job.

399
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,635
And with your earnings I'm to -

400
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:17,722
We could remove that distance
between us by then.

401
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,983
Your talent is so great.

402
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,446
Remember that picture in my room?
- The two kids?

403
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:35,740
My big brother and me.

404
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:41,997
We'd gone hiking
in the hills that morning.

405
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:46,167
We got up before dawn
to see sunrise from the peak.

406
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:48,169
What a strenuous climb!

407
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:50,380
But when the sun came <i>up...</i>

408
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:53,758
I just can't explain.

409
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,096
Shankar would tease me...

410
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:01,099
“Your little girl wants
to catch the moon.”

411
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,893
He still teases me.

412
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:07,731
- You don't deserve any of this.
- Of what?

413
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:11,026
This hardship, suffering,
and responsibility.

414
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:15,447
Then make a glass case

415
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:19,200
and place me inside
like a wax doll.

416
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,583
I'll be late for tutoring.
Shall we?

417
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:31,796
Neeta?

418
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,285
This is why I come to you.

419
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,663
You make all my troubles vanish.

420
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:52,836
No cause for alarm.
It's just a bone fracture.

421
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,797
Neeta, come outside.

422
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,429
An injury like that at his age

423
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:05,348
will take a long time to heal.

424
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,853
It looks like you'll have
to run the household now.

425
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,939
I'll go get medicine
for an injection.

426
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,525
He'll sleep till morning.

427
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,819
See you later.

428
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:19,904
I'll be back.

429
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,571
Neeta?

430
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:48,409
Weren't you working
toward an M.A. this year?

431
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:53,164
I couldn't continue.
I had to get a job.

432
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,916
See you.

433
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:31,119
Better come up
with a new line about your rent.

434
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:33,121
I told you yesterday -

435
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:36,249
“You'll get it when I do.”
That line's stale.

436
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,460
Are we your parents now...

437
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,839
that you can just ride
on our shoulders?

438
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:44,591
Get a job!

439
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,509
Settle down in life.

440
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:54,183
You'll never understand that
there's something called “an ideal”...

441
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:57,729
something one suffers for.

442
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:01,232
Your friend Saroj came by.

443
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,235
I asked him about these things
I can't understand.

444
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,822
Mukundo? Come here.

445
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,450
What did he say?

446
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:11,868
- National Chemical.
- One.

447
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,620
- Joy Engineering.
- Two.

448
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,705
- Jagat Hosiery.
- Three.

449
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,916
Three jobs await,

450
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:20,752
and you're studying hot air?

451
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,838
If only you could live on hot air!

452
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,007
The young lady is here

453
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,301
Show her in.

454
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,930
Your ideal has arrived.

455
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:47,278
- I’m dying of thirst.
- Hold on.

456
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,622
Here.

457
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:06,965
I'll take it.

458
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,889
I’ve been running around for days.
Luckily I found a job.

459
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,815
Things are bad
since Father's accident.

460
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,652
I don't like this one bit.

461
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,196
Why did you quit your studies?

462
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,199
What else could I do?

463
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:38,788
So many people at home...

464
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:42,166
all counting on me.

465
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:47,338
Walk me to the station?

466
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:52,301
Let's go.

467
00:41:56,681 --> 00:42:01,060
<i>Hail, Mother</i>

468
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,814
<i>Tarry no longer</i>

469
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:28,796
<i>Bless me with the virtues I crave</i>

470
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:51,903
Neeta!

471
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:56,074
Let me have four annas.
I need a shave!

472
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,243
Hey, why make me run after you?

473
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,706
Sorry.

474
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,259
<i>Knowledge</i>

475
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:19,388
<i>Virtue of the goddess Saraswati</i>

476
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:27,939
<i>Mother of the world</i>

477
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:19,031
Neeta, I couldn't bear
doing research

478
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,159
while you work.

479
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:24,579
I'll get a job.
You go back to school.

480
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:28,332
I can easily find work.

481
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:33,671
But... what about our wedding?

482
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,341
It can't happen now.

483
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,802
Why not?

484
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,221
How can it?

485
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,640
If I leave home now...

486
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:48,311
my father,
my little brother, my sister -

487
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:50,396
Shankar is a rascal!

488
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,648
That's his responsibility.

489
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,610
You just don't understand him.

490
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:58,696
He'll be great one day.

491
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,615
You'll see.

492
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,951
Just as you'll be great.

493
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:08,497
I’m pinning my hopes
on the two of you.

494
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,585
And then maybe
my time will come.

495
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,631
So you mean, until then...

496
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,218
We have to wait.

497
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:21,886
Why should we?

498
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,564
Don't be foolish.

499
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,616
- Neeta.
- Yes?

500
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,244
I'll come by in a day or two.

501
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:50,039
- All right.
- I have a question to ask.

502
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,334
A question?

503
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,714
Then come by.

504
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,992
- Bansi?
- Need to shave?

505
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:29,370
Here. How can I say no
to the great artist?

506
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:32,456
You're a singer.
You have to shave.

507
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:35,126
But have you shaved off
all shame too?

508
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:36,335
Shame?

509
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,380
Your whole family living
off your sister's labor

510
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,507
and destroying her future.

511
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,510
The whole camp is talking about it!

512
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,804
Aren't you the oldest brother?

513
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:51,309
Just because you give me blades
on credit doesn't mean -

514
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:53,019
Come off it!

515
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:57,106
I call Neeta “Sinbad the sailor,”

516
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:01,736
and you're like the old man
riding on Sinbad's shoulders.

517
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:04,030
Only death will set her free.

518
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,615
Only death will set her free!

519
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,826
Shame on you!

520
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:26,844
<i>I wasted all my good days</i>

521
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,350
<i>Now, in bad times</i>

522
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:45,237
<i>I've come to the river's edge</i>

523
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:54,580
<i>Boatman, I don't know your name</i>

524
00:47:55,206 --> 00:48:00,669
<i>Who shall I call out to?</i>

525
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:14,266
<i>Oh my heart,
who will take you across?</i>

526
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:25,152
<i>There is a boat but no boatman</i>

527
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:31,659
<i>There is no one on the river bank</i>

528
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,990
Sir, I finished the lesson.

529
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:13,909
I finished.

530
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:17,580
It's getting late.

531
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:21,041
Run along now.

532
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:32,094
Montu's skipped classes
for a month now.

533
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:34,805
I heard today that he's failing.

534
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,058
You hear me?

535
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:43,147
He's been struck from the rolls

536
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:45,816
because he can't pay the fees.

537
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:49,695
What use is college
to him anyway?

538
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:52,823
It's a good thing
that girl has a job.

539
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:56,327
Just as well, isn't it?

540
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:08,130
Father, did you hear about Montu?

541
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:11,926
Stop being the bearer of bad news!
Everyone knows!

542
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:15,137
They also know you're happiest

543
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,973
when this family's in trouble.

544
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:21,727
So what if he's failed?
What about you and that young man?

545
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,354
Woman!

546
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,235
Father...

547
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:32,238
a factory hired him last month

548
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:35,699
so he could be
on their soccer team.

549
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:39,995
He was too scared to tell you.

550
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:42,581
He brought home his first pay.

551
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,584
Everything's kept secret from me

552
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,295
as if I were the enemy!

553
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:51,215
Like father, like children!

554
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:53,801
I’m not touching that money!

555
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:57,721
You can run the household
and face the music.

556
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,390
Come along!

557
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,691
A factory job?

558
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,235
Labor?

559
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:17,074
What's it matter?

560
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:22,496
Those jobs offer
better prospects these days.

561
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:28,002
Just look what
the middle classes have sunk to!

562
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,383
Help me into the next room.

563
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:45,436
<i>Boatman, I don 't know your name...</i>

564
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:54,278
You all think I'm just an old nag,

565
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:56,655
always finding fault.

566
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:59,783
These last ten years

567
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:05,080
have taken a heavy toll
on my mind and spirit.

568
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:09,001
It's like I'm not the same person.

569
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:12,212
Ma, you needn't explain.

570
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:16,133
I can't bear the load
of this household anymore.

571
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:18,886
You have to set me free.

572
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,306
If Shankar were a real man,

573
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:25,643
you wouldn't have
such a load to carry.

574
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,103
Brother is a good man.

575
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:29,938
Really?

576
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:33,734
And don't count
on your Father anymore.

577
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:38,113
He might stand and walk
again someday...

578
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:44,578
but it's like his mind
is getting confused.

579
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,914
It's true!

580
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:50,376
He'll never earn a salary again.

581
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:54,963
I’ve known him since I was seven.

582
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:57,341
Don't worry, Ma.

583
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,678
I’m here.

584
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:02,471
I do worry!

585
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,140
You have
your own hopes and dreams...

586
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,102
and who knows what else.

587
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:13,273
In any case...

588
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:17,319
without you I have nothing.

589
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:20,906
I still can't put my mind at ease.

590
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:24,118
<i>The truth 'vs...</i>

591
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:28,997
you're my sole support.

592
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:33,085
But at the same time
you frighten me.

593
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:37,631
My own daughter,
yet so distant from me.

594
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,592
If you leave too...

595
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,302
Ma!

596
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:48,308
I’ve never understood you.

597
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,491
Why so quiet?

598
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:30,869
I don't want to interrupt.

599
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:41,213
- What is it?
- Come eat. It's late.

600
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:43,882
- You haven't eaten yet?
- No.

601
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,509
Why not?

602
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,469
Because you haven't.

603
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:51,598
Idiot.

604
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,685
Neeta?

605
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:59,565
I’m always taking advantage
of you, aren't I?

606
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:01,608
Don't start with that.

607
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,277
I mean it.

608
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,072
Your whole future...

609
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:09,783
your chance at marriage...

610
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:12,703
People are starting to talk.

611
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:15,789
- Is your male pride hurt?
- Idiot!

612
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:18,292
- No male pride?
- No.

613
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:21,044
I have something far bigger:
my music.

614
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:23,881
Right now I'm exploiting you...

615
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,717
but honestly...

616
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:30,721
deep down it bothers me.

617
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,140
Seriously?

618
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:35,100
Yes, seriously.

619
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,185
Listen to me.

620
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,564
I love all of you madly.

621
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:45,068
You all feel the same way.
You're just too shy to admit it.

622
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,244
And if someone else loves me...

623
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:57,331
truly loves me...

624
00:56:58,874 --> 00:57:01,251
he'll wait for me.

625
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:04,046
I have no fear about that.

626
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:11,637
I won't get married right now.

627
00:57:13,472 --> 00:57:15,599
When you become famous...

628
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,310
then I'll marry.

629
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:22,606
I can wait that long, can't I?

630
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,110
And then...

631
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:32,366
all my suffering will vanish.

632
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:35,452
Just don't you vanish too.

633
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,759
Will you take me to the hills then?

634
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:54,346
In those rolling, wide-open spaces,

635
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,890
we'll run and frolic.

636
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,146
Yes, I'll take you.

637
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:06,483
You really are such a child.

638
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:28,797
<i>Banish sadness and poverty</i>

639
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:37,764
<i>Bring happiness to all</i>

640
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:48,150
<i>Adarang makes this plea</i>

641
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:51,695
<i>Hear him</i>

642
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:59,786
<i>O Supreme Being</i>

643
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:06,334
<i>You are called the merciful one</i>

644
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,571
What are you staring at?

645
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:36,531
You look awful.

646
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:39,159
- Don't fall.
- What's that?

647
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:43,121
I’m using English like Father now.
I said don't fall.

648
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:48,585
What took you so long
to come by?

649
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:50,545
I just couldn't make it.

650
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:55,425
What was that question
you wanted to ask?

651
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:58,637
There's no need now.

652
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:31,837
Stay a while. I'll be back.
I have a student to tutor.

653
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:02,742
Ma, shall I take him some tea?

654
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:04,244
Who?

655
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,247
Some tea...?

656
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,207
Go on.

657
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:12,669
He's sitting all alone.

658
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,380
Shall I chat with him a bit?

659
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:18,091
Or take him out for a stroll?

660
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:20,051
Do whatever you like.

661
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:31,021
You can close your mouth now.

662
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,023
Have some.

663
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:36,193
Let's go for a stroll by the lake.

664
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:38,195
Neeta won't be back for a while.

665
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:42,032
Let's go.

666
01:01:47,162 --> 01:01:48,371
Leave that.

667
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:56,713
Shall we?

668
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:02,052
<i>O firefly</i>

669
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:11,978
<i>Man has no pity for you</i>

670
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:34,918
You say such silly things.
You make me laugh.

671
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,295
Why? What's so silly?

672
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,930
You have a beautiful voice.

673
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:56,564
I’ve kept putting them off.
My friend's in management there.

674
01:02:56,690 --> 01:03:00,193
Don't be foolish.
If it's a good job, take it.

675
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:03,113
Leave those lodgings,
get an apartment,

676
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,949
and find a nice girl.

677
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:09,452
We'll see...

678
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:15,875
Keep staring like that...

679
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:18,461
and you'll stare your whole life away!

680
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:31,474
<i>Do not wake me, my love</i>

681
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:37,272
<i>Or I shall curse you</i>

682
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:43,320
<i>I shall curse you</i>

683
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:51,453
<i>Do not wake me from my sleep</i>

684
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:58,668
<i>My beloved, I will curse you</i>

685
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:10,138
Those are my slippers!

686
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:13,224
Take them off!
- I just borrowed them.

687
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:14,934
Why?

688
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:17,020
You have two pairs.

689
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:19,731
You got them muddy!
Take them off!

690
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,900
I can't wear mine anymore.

691
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:24,986
I had to go to an event
with my maestro.

692
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:27,655
Get a job and buy your own!

693
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:29,282
Take them off!

694
01:04:36,915 --> 01:04:38,792
Montu...

695
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:42,379
could you spare a little something?

696
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:45,965
- What?
- Eight annas. No, four.

697
01:04:46,091 --> 01:04:48,301
I can't keep asking Neeta.

698
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:50,929
My hair's gotten so long.

699
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:54,891
If you're a beggar,
you should live like one.

700
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:56,518
Here.

701
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,229
Shankar, go to your room.

702
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:33,680
Come sit down.

703
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:56,619
A whole tenner!

704
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:05,336
Are your feelings hurt?

705
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,547
He's my little brother!

706
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:11,009
I’ve raised you all
since you were little kids.

707
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:13,219
Let him talk.

708
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:16,931
Get some clothes made.

709
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:21,269
Get a haircut and look decent.

710
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:24,105
And buy some sandals.

711
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:26,858
Careful!
You have a dark future ahead.

712
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:31,029
Suffer for others and there'll be
no end to your suffering.

713
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:32,655
Now sit.

714
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:47,253
Brother!

715
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:50,006
Idiot! You're a complete idiot!

716
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:54,928
No. In the words
of Bansi the grocer...

717
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:58,723
you're Sinbad the Sailor.

718
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:02,435
How else could a fool like me
make a fool of you?

719
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:27,710
What kind of boy is that Sanat?

720
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:35,218
Why?

721
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:40,557
The boy has no principles.

722
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:50,483
I must have shrimp today.
Where does all the money go?

723
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:53,027
Your salary, your tutoring,
Montu's salary -

724
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:56,614
admit you can't manage.
- Then why don't you do it?

725
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:59,075
”The best housewife
has no house,

726
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:01,828
and the most beautiful woman
has no husband.”

727
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:05,248
Neeta, my Pay.

728
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:13,881
Just 50?

729
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:16,801
I paid a month in advance
at the factory dorm.

730
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,928
That's right.

731
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:23,057
He's decided to stay
in the factory dorm from now on.

732
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:27,312
- You're leaving home?
- No, it's just a long way.

733
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:31,858
And to play on their team,
I need to eat well and keep fit.

734
01:08:31,983 --> 01:08:34,193
If you'd said something,
we could have -

735
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,029
No, it wouldn't work.

736
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:39,073
But I'll come give you
whatever I can spare.

737
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:42,201
A young man has his needs!

738
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:46,331
While his elders
just sit at home and eat!

739
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:49,876
Shankar, go do the shopping.

740
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:55,882
By the way...

741
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:58,635
I saw Sanat
at our head office today.

742
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:00,970
He took a job in supplies.

743
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,181
Imagine! A science student!

744
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:04,849
What's his salary?

745
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,644
Over 300 at least. Not bad!

746
01:09:07,769 --> 01:09:11,022
The boss is his buddy.
He has it made.

747
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:18,071
Sanat's not here.
He moved out last month.

748
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:20,073
Ah, it's you!

749
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:23,159
You want Sanat's address?
<i>I'll</i> write it down.

750
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:24,952
Give me your pen.

751
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:30,166
- Just give it back.
- I will.

752
01:10:44,532 --> 01:10:46,242
I took a job.

753
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:10,266
You're going?

754
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:47,738
Have you given any thought
to getting Geeta married?

755
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:51,701
I'll consider that
once Neeta is married.

756
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:55,204
One must think serially.
- Neeta!

757
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:58,499
You educated her,
so now she's running the household!

758
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:00,585
She can't marry now!

759
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:03,379
Finding a groom for a working girl

760
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:05,464
is less difficult.

761
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:09,677
So marry her off,
then sit and twiddle your thumbs.

762
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:12,722
If she leaves,
what will happen to this household?

763
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:20,730
So we should continue to exploit her
for our own survival?

764
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:22,732
What will you eat?

765
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:50,384
- Where have you been?
- Out for a stroll.

766
01:13:57,767 --> 01:14:01,103
- You have exams soon.
- They don't matter now.

767
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:02,897
Then what does?

768
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,399
I’m getting married.

769
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,946
To whom? Does Ma know?

770
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:11,614
Sanat.

771
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:22,667
No use running dramatically
out of the room.

772
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,171
Not everyone's the patient type.

773
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,131
You should learn that.

774
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:33,696
Any news of Montu?

775
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:37,867
He's playing a match in Delhi.

776
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:42,538
Listen...

777
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:46,876
Geeta asked
about your earrings and bangles.

778
01:15:47,168 --> 01:15:49,211
You know how she is.

779
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:53,549
She can take them.
She needs them more than me.

780
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:56,135
You know...

781
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:58,262
what I mean is...

782
01:15:59,013 --> 01:16:01,557
this isn't how I wanted it!

783
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:07,396
- How much yogurt should I order?
- Whatever you think.

784
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:32,338
Here's the list of names.
Have a look.

785
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:43,224
People used to marry
a daughter off to a dying man.

786
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:45,768
They were barbarians.

787
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:49,772
But now we're educated
and civilized.

788
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:53,484
So we educate her

789
01:16:53,776 --> 01:16:57,738
to wring her dry
and destroy her future!

790
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,116
That's the difference.

791
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:07,748
Oh dear, it's almost evening!

792
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:10,960
<i>I'll</i> bring you some tea.

793
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:13,462
Who wants tea?

794
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:17,091
Who's this little one?

795
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:21,595
Did no one give you any sweets?

796
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:54,503
Childhood seems so far away.

797
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:59,258
As for those hills...

798
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:03,012
they no longer seem
part of this world.

799
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:09,727
No one climbs hills anymore.

800
01:18:09,852 --> 01:18:12,730
They're all headed straight to hell.

801
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:19,904
Neeta...

802
01:18:20,905 --> 01:18:23,115
I got a job in a music school.

803
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,867
Don't tell Ma.

804
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:27,745
Get your M.A.

805
01:18:28,037 --> 01:18:30,039
<i>I'll</i> make the arrangements.

806
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:31,916
Shankar...

807
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:36,420
will you teach me
one of Tagore's songs?

808
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:44,094
What's that look?
I sang when I was a kid.

809
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:47,556
It's soft-hearted idiots like you
who get hurt the worst!

810
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:49,183
Fine!

811
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:51,852
Then make a glass case...

812
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:55,606
and place me inside
like a wax doll.

813
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:57,399
Listen to me!

814
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:07,826
<i>I’m...</i>

815
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:12,456
leaving this house.

816
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:18,712
Even though I'm just
a useless nobody here...

817
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:23,342
I can't take it anymore.

818
01:19:23,926 --> 01:19:26,679
I’m leaving in protest.

819
01:19:29,223 --> 01:19:32,268
You can go on suffering silently...

820
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:34,687
and get crushed to death!

821
01:19:39,817 --> 01:19:41,610
You want to learn a song?

822
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:46,282
I have to sing
at the wedding, don't I?

823
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:55,958
<i>That night when the storm
blew down my door</i>

824
01:19:57,501 --> 01:20:06,260
<i>Little did I know
you had entered my abode</i>

825
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:17,688
<i>That night when the storm
blew down my door</i>

826
01:20:19,398 --> 01:20:26,655
<i>Everything went dark</i>

827
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:34,913
<i>The lamp was blown out</i>

828
01:20:52,681 --> 01:21:02,524
<i>I stretched
my uncertain hands skyward</i>

829
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:13,535
<i>Little did I know
you had entered my abode</i>

830
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:25,339
<i>That night when the storm
blew down my door</i>

831
01:21:27,091 --> 01:21:36,934
<i>I lay in the dark as in a dream</i>

832
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:48,737
<i>How could I know
the storm was your victory banner?</i>

833
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:20,269
<i>When morning came</i>

834
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:29,027
<i>I saw you standing there</i>

835
01:22:46,837 --> 01:22:52,593
<i>In the void</i>

836
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:57,139
<i>That enveloped my abode</i>

837
01:22:58,098 --> 01:23:07,774
<i>Little did I know
you had entered my abode</i>

838
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:38,282
Neeta?

839
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:40,742
Aren't you going to work?

840
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:44,329
I don't feel well.
I have a fever.

841
01:24:44,538 --> 01:24:46,832
You don't come
to the library anymore.

842
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:49,251
<i>I'll</i> stop by.

843
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:26,330
<i>Who's there?</i>

844
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:31,877
<i>Who's there?
- W's me, Father.</i>

845
01:25:36,506 --> 01:25:39,134
It's a letter from Montu's factory.

846
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:41,053
What's it say?

847
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:49,227
There's no end to work.
The day just slips away.

848
01:25:49,353 --> 01:25:51,188
What is it?

849
01:25:51,688 --> 01:25:53,231
What's happened?

850
01:25:53,607 --> 01:25:55,067
Let me see.

851
01:25:57,694 --> 01:26:01,114
“Last night
on the night shift, Montu -”

852
01:26:01,531 --> 01:26:04,201
He's not dead! He's just injured!

853
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:09,498
The machine
didn't devour him completely.

854
01:26:09,665 --> 01:26:11,625
This was expected!

855
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:15,253
I’m going to the hospital.
Don't worry.

856
01:26:16,755 --> 01:26:20,175
This was expected.
It had to happen.

857
01:26:35,315 --> 01:26:39,528
The doctor says
he'll need a blood transfusion.

858
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:41,697
Is that expensive?

859
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:44,241
Yes. Make arrangements
by tomorrow.

860
01:26:44,366 --> 01:26:46,410
The crisis isn't over yet.

861
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:02,384
You're very warm!

862
01:27:02,801 --> 01:27:05,554
You shouldn't be
running around with a fever.

863
01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:07,848
I’m often feverish.

864
01:27:07,973 --> 01:27:09,683
Every evening?

865
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:12,394
You should get an X-ray.

866
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:24,406
- Doctor?
- Yes?

867
01:27:25,115 --> 01:27:26,908
It's Neeta.

868
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:29,911
She keeps everything to herself.

869
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:33,582
She won't say what's on her mind.

870
01:27:34,207 --> 01:27:37,586
I apprehend some trouble.

871
01:27:38,587 --> 01:27:40,756
She's feverish.

872
01:27:42,507 --> 01:27:46,178
And with Montu's accident,

873
01:27:46,386 --> 01:27:50,932
she's been running around
trying to arrange for blood.

874
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:54,060
She's under terrible pressure.

875
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:57,022
We have no money.

876
01:27:57,773 --> 01:27:59,691
And now Neeta!

877
01:27:59,816 --> 01:28:03,361
If you have a moment,
could you check on her?

878
01:28:11,912 --> 01:28:14,581
Neeta? Sit down.

879
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:17,292
I’ve come to see Geeta.

880
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:24,508
I’ve eaten nothing all day.

881
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:27,052
Could I have some water?

882
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:34,142
Where's Geeta?
- Napping.

883
01:28:42,359 --> 01:28:43,485
Here.

884
01:28:51,493 --> 01:28:52,828
You're not at work?

885
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:56,623
No. I stay home quite often.

886
01:28:57,457 --> 01:28:59,167
I don't like it there.

887
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:01,169
What about you?

888
01:29:05,632 --> 01:29:10,345
Montu had an accident.
He's in the hospital.

889
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:14,266
I’ve been in a terrible state
these two days.

890
01:29:15,141 --> 01:29:17,102
He needs a transfusion.

891
01:29:18,562 --> 01:29:21,857
There's been no time
to even let you know.

892
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:28,196
Neeta's here.

893
01:29:28,905 --> 01:29:31,867
So I see.
How long have you been here?

894
01:29:47,883 --> 01:29:49,551
It's late.

895
01:29:50,886 --> 01:29:52,387
I have to go.

896
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:05,400
You let her go?

897
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:07,527
She didn't come to see me.

898
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:09,905
You could have been
more hospitable.

899
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:13,867
You don't know,
yet you jump to conclusions.

900
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,202
I don't need to know.

901
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:20,832
Montu had an accident.
He's in the hospital.

902
01:30:25,629 --> 01:30:29,007
I didn't even find out
what she came for.

903
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:42,771
What's your name, dear girl?

904
01:31:07,379 --> 01:31:09,631
You'd be wise to get an X-ray.

905
01:31:09,798 --> 01:31:12,300
I could arrange it for you.

906
01:31:13,176 --> 01:31:16,096
And what if I really am ill?

907
01:31:16,638 --> 01:31:18,848
I’m the only breadwinner.

908
01:31:18,974 --> 01:31:22,477
In any case,
the blood's needed immediately.

909
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:33,154
- How's Montu?
- All right.

910
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:36,282
Shall we get some tea?

911
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:38,994
Can you help me get some money?

912
01:31:39,202 --> 01:31:42,205
He needs blood and medicine.

913
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:46,334
I can't get anything anywhere.
That's why I went to see Geeta.

914
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:47,669
How much?

915
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:49,295
150 Will do.

916
01:31:49,796 --> 01:31:51,339
Come with me.

917
01:31:53,049 --> 01:31:54,509
What's wrong?

918
01:31:55,301 --> 01:31:57,595
Nothing. I feel dizzy.

919
01:31:58,054 --> 01:32:00,098
You should get some rest.

920
01:32:00,306 --> 01:32:02,350
I say it for your own sake.

921
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:04,185
My Sake?

922
01:32:04,352 --> 01:32:06,855
I look like one of hell's ravens...

923
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:09,524
working myself to death.

924
01:32:13,695 --> 01:32:15,196
Where is he?

925
01:32:15,864 --> 01:32:17,365
Come along.

926
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:21,036
<i>I'll</i> bring the money here tomorrow.

927
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:38,887
- Where are those 150 rupees?
- I gave them to Mother.

928
01:32:39,512 --> 01:32:41,347
You mean Neeta.

929
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:45,935
You're right. It's my money.

930
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:47,896
- An old flame -
- Stop it!

931
01:32:52,317 --> 01:32:55,111
Control your tongue
or you'll be sorry.

932
01:32:55,236 --> 01:32:57,030
I’m warning you.

933
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:31,523
<i>Come to my arms, Uma</i>

934
01:33:34,776 --> 01:33:41,449
<i>In your garland of flowers</i>

935
01:33:41,741 --> 01:33:47,956
<i>Your heart is full of sorrow</i>

936
01:33:48,206 --> 01:33:54,796
<i>O Mother deliverer</i>

937
01:33:58,174 --> 01:34:05,682
<i>Go, my daughter,
to your husband's house</i>

938
01:34:08,268 --> 01:34:13,189
<i>Leaving my house desolate</i>

939
01:35:46,032 --> 01:35:48,201
Did you hear about Shankar?

940
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:53,081
He's made quite a name
for himself in Bombay.

941
01:35:53,581 --> 01:35:55,708
It was even on the radio.

942
01:35:58,419 --> 01:36:01,089
What's wrong with you?
- Why?

943
01:36:01,256 --> 01:36:04,759
Making your bed in the outer room
at this late hour?

944
01:36:04,926 --> 01:36:07,929
Inner room or outer room...

945
01:36:09,347 --> 01:36:13,810
it's all the same
in this godforsaken house.

946
01:36:13,935 --> 01:36:17,230
You plan to go on
hiding everything from me?

947
01:36:17,730 --> 01:36:20,441
When there was time to listen,

948
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:22,527
you weren't interested.

949
01:36:23,069 --> 01:36:29,075
Now there's
an unbridgeable chasm between us.

950
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:37,834
This tongue of mine!

951
01:36:39,502 --> 01:36:41,587
This tongue of mine!

952
01:36:43,131 --> 01:36:45,466
I’ve lost control of it.

953
01:36:46,968 --> 01:36:51,848
It's built a wall between me
and the whole world.

954
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:55,810
Spare me your sob story
at this late hour.

955
01:36:57,603 --> 01:37:00,523
I work in the morning.

956
01:37:38,686 --> 01:37:40,521
Are you going to work?

957
01:37:43,733 --> 01:37:46,361
I have something to say.
Come.

958
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:50,615
<i>No.</i>

959
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:29,362
- What can we do now?
- So I should go on acting a part?

960
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:33,491
It's not acting.

961
01:38:36,035 --> 01:38:37,829
Perhaps it's our penance.

962
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:40,081
Penance?

963
01:38:41,207 --> 01:38:42,917
But you never sinned.

964
01:38:45,044 --> 01:38:46,712
Didn't I?

965
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:49,090
I never protested
the wrongs done me.

966
01:38:49,215 --> 01:38:50,591
That's my sin.

967
01:38:51,426 --> 01:38:53,094
<i>The truth 'vs...</i>

968
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:55,847
I shouldn't have been so ordinary.

969
01:38:59,976 --> 01:39:01,561
Go on home.

970
01:39:04,522 --> 01:39:07,191
You have nothing else to say?

971
01:39:09,777 --> 01:39:11,446
What else can I say?

972
01:39:12,613 --> 01:39:14,824
Now that I think about it...

973
01:39:15,283 --> 01:39:18,119
it's all quite distant now.

974
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:21,956
Now there's only work.

975
01:39:24,542 --> 01:39:27,753
Neeta, you've been made clean.

976
01:39:28,754 --> 01:39:30,756
I want to be clean too.

977
01:39:31,507 --> 01:39:35,428
<i>I'll</i> quit my job and go back
to a life of struggle.

978
01:39:35,553 --> 01:39:38,973
Whatever obstacles arise,
I'll face them.

979
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:44,645
I may be rotten,
but I have my limits too.

980
01:39:48,149 --> 01:39:50,651
I can't go on banging
my head against a wall.

981
01:40:10,922 --> 01:40:12,632
<i>No, she's fine.</i>

982
01:40:12,757 --> 01:40:15,968
<i>Give her this at night
and keep an eye on her...</i>

983
01:40:50,294 --> 01:40:51,796
What happened?

984
01:40:51,921 --> 01:40:54,131
She took a little fall.

985
01:42:03,659 --> 01:42:06,579
Miss Chakraborty, are you ill?

986
01:42:07,079 --> 01:42:08,247
<i>No.</i>

987
01:42:08,456 --> 01:42:12,126
I can ask the manager
to give you time off.

988
01:42:12,585 --> 01:42:15,379
Don't bother. He won't do it.

989
01:43:17,692 --> 01:43:21,696
<i>A poor brahman in Mathura</i>

990
01:43:21,862 --> 01:43:25,866
<i>Who had never known happiness</i>

991
01:43:26,367 --> 01:43:30,204
<i>Begged all over town one day</i>

992
01:43:30,496 --> 01:43:34,709
<i>But received no aims</i>

993
01:43:35,126 --> 01:43:39,004
<i>He sat beneath a tree disheartened</i>

994
01:43:39,547 --> 01:43:43,718
<i>And wept long and hard</i>

995
01:43:44,218 --> 01:43:48,264
<i>Then the sage Satyanarayana</i>

996
01:43:48,556 --> 01:43:52,518
<i>Approached
in the guise of a fakir</i>

997
01:43:52,935 --> 01:43:57,022
<i>“O brahman...</i>

998
01:43:57,398 --> 01:44:01,402
<i>Why do you sit weeping
on the ground?”</i>

999
01:44:01,777 --> 01:44:05,781
<i>The brahman said,
“Will telling you help me?”</i>

1000
01:44:05,948 --> 01:44:09,827
<i>The fakir replied,
“What do you have to lose?”</i>

1001
01:44:13,456 --> 01:44:15,916
Let's see your bandages!

1002
01:44:16,083 --> 01:44:18,377
Stop running around
in your condition.

1003
01:44:18,502 --> 01:44:21,255
Did you prepare the holy offerings?
Go on!

1004
01:44:24,884 --> 01:44:26,177
Go on.

1005
01:44:34,393 --> 01:44:37,772
God doesn't give you
more than you can bear.

1006
01:44:37,897 --> 01:44:41,734
With his grace we learn
to stand up straight again.

1007
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:43,652
Go on.

1008
01:44:51,952 --> 01:44:54,330
Husband, did you hear?

1009
01:44:54,455 --> 01:44:57,792
The boss himself
brought Montu home!

1010
01:44:58,125 --> 01:45:00,628
My Montu still has his job.

1011
01:45:01,045 --> 01:45:03,672
And they'll pay compensation too!

1012
01:45:03,798 --> 01:45:06,842
Over a thousand rupees.
Right, Montu?

1013
01:45:19,814 --> 01:45:21,315
Sit down.

1014
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:04,525
<i>“The auspicious moment has come
to be united with my lord</i>

1015
01:46:09,029 --> 01:46:13,492
<i>A moment of supreme happiness
and joy,” says the young woman</i>

1016
01:47:19,975 --> 01:47:22,061
Isn't that Shankar?

1017
01:47:22,645 --> 01:47:24,480
When did you get back?

1018
01:47:24,605 --> 01:47:26,565
Your picture's in the papers!

1019
01:47:26,690 --> 01:47:29,360
Made it big in Bombay, did you?

1020
01:47:29,485 --> 01:47:31,236
Sort of.

1021
01:47:31,570 --> 01:47:33,572
An autograph.

1022
01:47:52,174 --> 01:47:55,928
Shankar, I heard you sing
on the radio.

1023
01:47:56,553 --> 01:47:58,430
You're the pride of Bengal.

1024
01:47:58,555 --> 01:48:01,475
Show 'em how a Bengal tiger roars!

1025
01:48:01,684 --> 01:48:04,061
I heard you get
500 rupees per concert!

1026
01:48:04,186 --> 01:48:06,605
Me? No.

1027
01:48:07,606 --> 01:48:11,151
I never sing for less than 1,200.

1028
01:48:14,196 --> 01:48:17,658
<i>My body is fragrant with perfume</i>

1029
01:48:17,825 --> 01:48:21,245
<i>My forehead is marked
with sandal paste</i>

1030
01:48:21,495 --> 01:48:25,040
<i>My doe eyes are lined with kohl</i>

1031
01:48:25,332 --> 01:48:28,877
<i>My husband, Amar Muni, awaits</i>

1032
01:49:17,509 --> 01:49:21,263
I asked you to get here earlier.
Why so late?

1033
01:49:21,805 --> 01:49:25,350
You've gotten quite a name!
They say you make thousands!

1034
01:49:25,559 --> 01:49:28,687
People say you're terribly famous.
- Really?

1035
01:49:28,812 --> 01:49:32,274
If it's a boy,
you have to buy me a necklace.

1036
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:33,400
All right.

1037
01:49:33,525 --> 01:49:35,819
Won't you come
back home to live?

1038
01:49:35,944 --> 01:49:38,655
If the house doesn't suit you,
redo it!

1039
01:49:38,781 --> 01:49:40,324
<i>Son!</i>

1040
01:49:40,532 --> 01:49:42,159
Corning!

1041
01:49:53,629 --> 01:49:56,965
Eviction will always be
a threat for us.

1042
01:49:57,216 --> 01:49:59,468
Yet we shore up our courage,

1043
01:49:59,593 --> 01:50:01,887
think of family,
and forget our woes.

1044
01:50:02,221 --> 01:50:04,348
Husband, tell him...

1045
01:50:04,848 --> 01:50:07,851
how I've always wanted
a two-story house.

1046
01:50:07,976 --> 01:50:10,854
Tear this down
and build two stories.

1047
01:50:11,105 --> 01:50:13,982
The kitchen can stay as it is.

1048
01:50:14,233 --> 01:50:16,443
That's easy enough to repair.

1049
01:50:16,735 --> 01:50:18,320
Repair?

1050
01:50:21,532 --> 01:50:23,117
Can you do that?

1051
01:50:24,284 --> 01:50:27,621
Can you repair my mind too?

1052
01:50:31,959 --> 01:50:35,295
So I can read Wordsworth again

1053
01:50:35,879 --> 01:50:37,840
and feel that satisfaction...

1054
01:50:38,507 --> 01:50:44,012
“Swan and shadow, float double!”

1055
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:50,102
He's gone crazy in the head.

1056
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:52,271
Where's Neeta?

1057
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:54,815
Neeta?

1058
01:50:54,940 --> 01:50:56,692
Over in that room.

1059
01:50:56,817 --> 01:50:59,611
She goes to work,
then returns to that room.

1060
01:51:00,154 --> 01:51:01,864
Eats there too.

1061
01:51:02,990 --> 01:51:05,492
Has nothing to do with anyone.

1062
01:51:06,410 --> 01:51:08,412
Keeps everything hidden.

1063
01:51:09,204 --> 01:51:11,957
She's feverish and ill...

1064
01:51:12,166 --> 01:51:14,168
but doesn't tell anyone.

1065
01:51:15,127 --> 01:51:17,337
Even washes her own dishes.

1066
01:51:31,685 --> 01:51:33,312
What's this?

1067
01:51:33,687 --> 01:51:36,481
Love letters
at your advanced age?

1068
01:51:36,732 --> 01:51:39,359
Let me see!
- No, don't!

1069
01:52:35,916 --> 01:52:38,585
I was just watching all of you.

1070
01:52:41,630 --> 01:52:46,677
It's wonderful
how you've each found your niche.

1071
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:10,534
It's like when we were kids.

1072
01:53:12,202 --> 01:53:14,746
It's just like when we were kids.

1073
01:53:16,623 --> 01:53:20,085
I have no responsibilities now.

1074
01:53:31,263 --> 01:53:32,848
What's wrong?

1075
01:53:41,982 --> 01:53:43,984
Neeta has T.B.

1076
01:53:44,109 --> 01:53:46,069
An advanced stage.

1077
01:53:46,653 --> 01:53:48,155
My poor sister!

1078
01:53:48,697 --> 01:53:49,906
I accuse!

1079
01:53:50,157 --> 01:53:51,241
Whom?

1080
01:53:54,953 --> 01:53:56,413
No one.

1081
01:54:02,419 --> 01:54:05,630
<i>I'll</i> arrange for treatment
and come back this evening.

1082
01:54:06,298 --> 01:54:08,133
<i>I'll</i> stay here tonight.

1083
01:55:11,738 --> 01:55:14,408
I packed up your things.

1084
01:55:33,927 --> 01:55:35,595
Leave here.

1085
01:55:36,388 --> 01:55:37,889
Go away.

1086
01:55:41,685 --> 01:55:44,604
They're dreaming of two stories now.

1087
01:55:46,773 --> 01:55:48,942
You were successful!

1088
01:55:50,235 --> 01:55:53,113
You set them all on their feet.

1089
01:55:53,488 --> 01:55:54,823
Father!

1090
01:55:54,948 --> 01:55:57,117
Why Stay any longer?

1091
01:55:59,202 --> 01:56:01,955
Now they just pity YOU-

1092
01:56:03,373 --> 01:56:07,002
You weren't up
to carrying the burden...

1093
01:56:07,335 --> 01:56:10,797
yet you were forced to.

1094
01:56:11,339 --> 01:56:14,468
Now you yourself
have become the burden.

1095
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:21,808
Your breath is poison now!

1096
01:56:28,565 --> 01:56:31,818
This room is for the newborn.

1097
01:56:53,298 --> 01:56:55,467
Leave.

1098
01:56:55,675 --> 01:56:57,344
Go away!

1099
01:57:04,392 --> 01:57:11,900
<i>Come to my arms, Uma</i>

1100
01:57:17,489 --> 01:57:24,621
<i>In your garland of flowers</i>

1101
01:57:27,165 --> 01:57:35,799
<i>Your heart is full of sorrow</i>

1102
01:57:36,091 --> 01:57:40,011
<i>O Mother deliverer</i>

1103
01:57:46,393 --> 01:57:52,065
<i>Go, my daughter,
to your husband's house</i>

1104
01:57:59,489 --> 01:58:05,245
<i>Leaving my house desolate</i>

1105
01:58:09,165 --> 01:58:15,422
<i>How can this grieving mother</i>

1106
01:58:16,423 --> 01:58:22,262
<i>Bear to let you go?</i>

1107
01:58:30,103 --> 01:58:31,771
Where are you going?

1108
01:58:44,451 --> 01:58:45,827
Idiot!

1109
01:58:45,952 --> 01:58:50,332
I just made arrangements
at a sanatorium in the Shillong hills.

1110
01:58:54,127 --> 01:58:55,962
Yes, the hills.

1111
01:59:02,636 --> 01:59:06,806
At last you'll see the hills.

1112
02:00:56,499 --> 02:00:58,293
- Come with me.
- Yes.

1113
02:01:00,837 --> 02:01:02,922
She likes hills?

1114
02:01:03,047 --> 02:01:05,759
Oh, very much.
Right from her childhood.

1115
02:01:08,428 --> 02:01:11,473
We make her sit there,
since she's better now.

1116
02:01:11,598 --> 02:01:14,267
Oh, yes, I am happy, Sister.

1117
02:01:15,435 --> 02:01:18,897
But remember:
Don't excite her.

1118
02:01:19,022 --> 02:01:23,401
She may have a relapse,
which is dangerous.

1119
02:01:23,735 --> 02:01:25,904
Keep her happy.

1120
02:01:26,279 --> 02:01:28,156
Yes, Sister.

1121
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:33,578
She is there.

1122
02:01:33,703 --> 02:01:35,163
Thank you, Sister.

1123
02:01:35,288 --> 02:01:36,998
Please don't mention it.

1124
02:02:45,900 --> 02:02:48,194
A “cloud-capped star.”

1125
02:02:51,030 --> 02:02:52,866
Sanat's letter.

1126
02:02:57,662 --> 02:03:00,498
I wonder why I kept it so long.

1127
02:03:05,253 --> 02:03:08,756
You know, the house
has a second story now.

1128
02:03:08,882 --> 02:03:11,926
And Geeta's son is walking.

1129
02:03:12,051 --> 02:03:14,762
- Is he mischievous?
- Yes!

1130
02:03:15,847 --> 02:03:19,475
<i>I'll</i> bet he's always
jumping around and playing.

1131
02:03:22,270 --> 02:03:25,398
He's made Father's life hell.

1132
02:03:25,732 --> 02:03:29,944
He's always climbing
the stairs by himself!

1133
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:35,074
That kid's so full of life,
always raising a racket!

1134
02:03:35,199 --> 02:03:38,912
He can't resist the urge
to climb those stairs!

1135
02:03:39,037 --> 02:03:41,789
I really did want to live!

1136
02:03:51,883 --> 02:03:55,178
I really did want to live!

1137
02:03:55,303 --> 02:03:58,264
I love so much to be alive!

1138
02:03:58,473 --> 02:04:00,350
I Will live!

1139
02:04:00,475 --> 02:04:02,310
I Will!

1140
02:04:02,727 --> 02:04:05,855
Tell me just once <i>I'll</i> live.

1141
02:04:06,105 --> 02:04:07,315
Nurse!

1142
02:04:08,274 --> 02:04:09,984
I Will live!

1143
02:04:10,193 --> 02:04:12,528
I Will!

1144
02:04:15,698 --> 02:04:17,951
Have you lost your mind?

1145
02:04:18,618 --> 02:04:22,622
Why are you yelling
like a madwoman?

1146
02:04:27,126 --> 02:04:30,546
I Will live!

1147
02:05:00,535 --> 02:05:02,912
Shankar, is that you?

1148
02:05:03,037 --> 02:05:05,456
Back from seeing your sister?

1149
02:05:05,581 --> 02:05:07,208
How is she?

1150
02:05:07,959 --> 02:05:10,461
Why don't you say anything?

1151
02:05:11,629 --> 02:05:15,174
No one around here
remembers her anymore,

1152
02:05:15,383 --> 02:05:19,387
how she'd pass by every day,
her sandals flapping.

1153
02:05:19,595 --> 02:05:23,307
Such a gentle girl.
Why did she have to suffer so?
