1
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,408
Hello.
- Hi, Gul. How are you?

2
00:05:02,491 --> 00:05:05,616
Where are you?
- I am good. I am at home.

3
00:05:05,783 --> 00:05:07,700
But I am going out after some time.
Where are you?

4
00:05:07,783 --> 00:05:09,200
What do you mean, where are you?

5
00:05:09,283 --> 00:05:10,950
I am busy arranging for your party.

6
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:14,616
What rubbish! When did I say to
throw a bash for me? - You didn't say.

7
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,408
But I thought I should give you
a farewell party before you leave.

8
00:05:18,491 --> 00:05:19,700
I don't know when we will meet again.

9
00:05:19,783 --> 00:05:22,616
Karan, you are trying to entice me?

10
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,491
Sweetheart, I am not enticing you.

11
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,950
I like you. I love you.

12
00:05:28,033 --> 00:05:30,200
And you know?
It's not a crime to love.

13
00:05:30,283 --> 00:05:33,366
Karan, you know it very well
that I don't have time..

14
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,158
..for useless things like love.

15
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,533
I am focused on my career, man.

16
00:05:38,616 --> 00:05:40,866
That's why I am leaving Jaipur
and going to Mumbai.

17
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,366
Okay. Be focused. Make your career.

18
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,700
But reach the party by 9 o'clock.

19
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:48,533
I have called all our friends.

20
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:50,033
I am not too sure, Karan.

21
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,825
I will ask my mom and inform you. Okay?

22
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,908
No asking. I don't care. You have to come.

23
00:05:54,991 --> 00:05:56,283
I will wait for you.

24
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:58,783
Some people are born to wait.

25
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,283
I will come. But I will be late. Okay?

26
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,408
"Serve me more drinks."

27
00:06:21,491 --> 00:06:23,408
"Let me get intoxicated."

28
00:06:23,491 --> 00:06:27,450
"Let me see you rock this party
and get down with me."

29
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:29,366
"Serve me more drinks."

30
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,450
"Let me get intoxicated."

31
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:33,408
"I am young."

32
00:06:33,491 --> 00:06:35,408
"Show me the magic."

33
00:06:35,491 --> 00:06:37,450
"Give me either whiskey or rum."

34
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:39,366
"Or give me country liquor."

35
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,575
"Mix either soda or coke."

36
00:06:41,658 --> 00:06:43,408
"Or serve it on the rocks."

37
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:45,158
"I am sloshed, my friend."

38
00:06:45,241 --> 00:06:49,200
"The colours of the world
got immersed in the bottle."

39
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:53,075
"It's a strong intoxication
for this lover boy."

40
00:06:53,158 --> 00:06:57,075
"I am in the mood to sing and dance."

41
00:06:57,158 --> 00:06:59,408
"The Patiala of love."

42
00:06:59,491 --> 00:07:01,408
"Serve me more drinks."

43
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:04,075
"Let me get intoxicated."

44
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:07,366
"Let me see you rock this party
and get down with me."

45
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,366
"Serve me more drinks."

46
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,825
"Let me get intoxicated."

47
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,408
"I am young."

48
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:15,866
"Show me the magic."

49
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,616
"Give me either vodka or Bacardi."

50
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,450
"Or else Jack."

51
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:37,491
"Mix in some love."

52
00:07:37,575 --> 00:07:39,158
"Show some moves."

53
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:41,366
"I am ruined. I am beaten."

54
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,783
"I am a cool man."

55
00:07:42,908 --> 00:07:44,700
"I am in the mood for drinks."

56
00:07:44,783 --> 00:07:46,741
"And with that the beauty of your youth."

57
00:07:46,825 --> 00:07:49,158
"I am in the mood for drinks."

58
00:07:49,241 --> 00:07:52,991
"Let's celebrate and drink."

59
00:07:53,075 --> 00:07:55,408
"The Patiala of love."

60
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:57,825
"Serve me more drinks."

61
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,116
"Let me get intoxicated."

62
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,408
"Let me see you rock this party
and get down with me."

63
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:05,950
"Serve me more drinks."

64
00:08:06,075 --> 00:08:08,116
"Let me get intoxicated."

65
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,408
"I am young."

66
00:08:09,491 --> 00:08:11,575
"Show me the magic."

67
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:30,158
"What a trance of youth!"

68
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:32,075
"Do as you please."

69
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,158
"Let nights get crazy, beloved."

70
00:08:36,241 --> 00:08:38,075
"What a trance of youth!"

71
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:40,075
"Do as you please."

72
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:43,200
"Write a nice saga, beloved."

73
00:08:43,283 --> 00:08:45,991
"Serve me more drinks."

74
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:48,075
"Let me get intoxicated."

75
00:08:48,158 --> 00:08:51,408
"Let me see you rock this party
and get down with me."

76
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:54,033
"Serve me more drinks."

77
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,116
"Let me get intoxicated."

78
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,450
"I am young."

79
00:08:57,533 --> 00:08:59,408
"Show me the magic."

80
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:01,991
"Serve me more drinks."

81
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:04,116
"Let me get intoxicated."

82
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,408
"Let me see you rock this party
and get down with me."

83
00:09:07,491 --> 00:09:10,033
"Serve me more drinks."

84
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,033
"Let me get intoxicated."

85
00:09:12,116 --> 00:09:13,491
"I am young."

86
00:09:13,575 --> 00:09:15,658
"Show me the magic."

87
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,700
What are you thinking?

88
00:09:39,741 --> 00:09:43,491
You know, Gul.
Jaipur will be lonely without you.

89
00:09:43,575 --> 00:09:44,991
And you?

90
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:48,908
I have become lonely.

91
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:54,366
It's very late. I have to go home now.

92
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,325
Can't you cancel it?

93
00:09:57,408 --> 00:09:58,908
What? Going home?

94
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:02,408
Mumbai. - No way, Karan.

95
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:04,408
Mumbai is my dream city.

96
00:10:04,491 --> 00:10:07,075
And you know Pia has found
such a nice job for me.

97
00:10:07,158 --> 00:10:09,116
I can't lose this opportunity.

98
00:10:12,408 --> 00:10:13,825
And you can lose me.

99
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,325
Karan, path is meant to take
travellers to their destination.

100
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:20,908
And not to stop them. Understood?

101
00:10:20,991 --> 00:10:22,533
I am just a path for you?

102
00:10:22,616 --> 00:10:24,283
You are not my destination too.

103
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:26,533
Fine, Gul.

104
00:10:27,408 --> 00:10:28,991
You will meet me once
before you leave, won't you?

105
00:10:29,075 --> 00:10:30,491
Of course.

106
00:11:25,658 --> 00:11:27,283
Go to sleep.

107
00:11:28,116 --> 00:11:29,783
Your daughter has returned.

108
00:11:29,908 --> 00:11:32,908
Ask her where she was the whole night.

109
00:11:35,075 --> 00:11:37,491
Her friends had thrown a bash.

110
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:40,033
Farewell party. She is going to Mumbai.

111
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,741
Party is fine. But till 2 o'clock?

112
00:11:43,658 --> 00:11:47,825
Her lifestyle here is such.
What will she do in Mumbai?

113
00:11:48,616 --> 00:11:50,908
I worry when I think about it.

114
00:11:50,991 --> 00:11:57,700
Her friend Pia has found her a job.

115
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,700
In a fashion house.

116
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:02,241
She will be busy in Mumbai.

117
00:12:03,575 --> 00:12:05,700
I don't think so.

118
00:12:08,658 --> 00:12:11,533
Well, she is our daughter.

119
00:12:12,616 --> 00:12:14,575
She will make us proud.

120
00:12:15,575 --> 00:12:17,658
And keep your diary with you.

121
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,116
It pricks me the whole night.

122
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,491
Shobha.

123
00:12:30,908 --> 00:12:33,366
Mother, catch. - Oh, God. Gul.

124
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,783
Stop it.

125
00:12:35,658 --> 00:12:38,825
Shobha. - Yes. Coming. Sit.

126
00:12:40,366 --> 00:12:42,658
Gul, how many clothes will you take?

127
00:12:44,158 --> 00:12:45,241
Yes. - Yes.

128
00:12:45,325 --> 00:12:48,366
Mother and daughter's meeting is over?
- Yes. It's over.

129
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,741
Gul.

130
00:12:50,408 --> 00:12:52,991
Last night you returned home very late.
I didn't like that.

131
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:56,325
I don't like it that you
are going to Mumbai.

132
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,658
And call.. - And call up as soon
as you reach there. Right?

133
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,950
Yes.

134
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:01,741
Come on. Let's go and have some breakfast.
- Yes, papa.

135
00:13:01,825 --> 00:13:03,450
You go. We are coming.
- There is still time for her flight.

136
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:04,658
Okay. We are coming.

137
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:05,825
Come on. Come on. - Coming, papa. Coming.

138
00:13:05,908 --> 00:13:07,283
Enough. Enough. Enough. - Come on.

139
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:09,408
Okay. - Enough. Enough. Enough.

140
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:11,533
How many clothes will you take? Enough.

141
00:13:22,741 --> 00:13:24,616
Come, dear. Whose call was it?

142
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,950
Nothing, papa.
- You are going to start a new life.

143
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:29,908
I am certain.. - Take this.

144
00:13:29,991 --> 00:13:31,325
Thanks, mother.

145
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,033
Okay. Yes, of course.

146
00:13:33,116 --> 00:13:34,450
Here, baby. Have a banana.

147
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:37,700
It's also good for you. - Thank you, papa.

148
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:41,491
She is so excited to go to Mumbai
that she has lost her appetite.

149
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,616
Mom, dad, I still have
a lot of packing to do.

150
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,950
And I don't want to miss my flight.

151
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,366
I am going. Bye. - Okay. Okay. I am coming.

152
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,158
Sit down. Just pack a sandwich for her.
Okay? - Okay. I will do it.

153
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:51,783
And remember one more thing.

154
00:13:51,908 --> 00:13:53,200
No late nights. - Yes, dad.

155
00:13:53,283 --> 00:13:54,491
Okay? - No late nights.

156
00:13:54,575 --> 00:13:55,908
Back home by 12. - Yes.

157
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:57,158
Right? - Right. - Alright.

158
00:13:57,241 --> 00:13:58,700
Ram Gopal, done? - Yes, sir. - Thank you.

159
00:13:58,783 --> 00:14:00,075
Bye, Ram Gopal. - Bye.

160
00:14:00,158 --> 00:14:01,491
Yes, Ravi. 3:30. Okay.

161
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,700
I have to go, sweetie.
- No. - I am so sorry.

162
00:14:03,783 --> 00:14:05,283
I have to go. I will see you
in the evening. - Okay. Okay.

163
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:06,491
Okay? - Okay. Bye. See you.

164
00:14:06,575 --> 00:14:07,700
Good luck, honey. - Bye, dad. Love you.

165
00:14:07,741 --> 00:14:09,283
Yes, Ravi. Okay.

166
00:14:09,366 --> 00:14:10,700
One hour.

167
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:26,533
Whose call was it, dear? Wrong number?

168
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,783
No, mom. Wrong person.

169
00:14:30,075 --> 00:14:31,366
Wrong person.

170
00:14:32,575 --> 00:14:33,908
Dear.

171
00:14:34,616 --> 00:14:36,033
Your dad is really worried for you.

172
00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:37,991
You need to change your lifestyle.

173
00:14:38,075 --> 00:14:39,783
Mother, I am not a kid anymore.

174
00:14:39,908 --> 00:14:41,991
That's why I am saying, dear.

175
00:14:42,075 --> 00:14:44,366
The life that you were leading in Jaipur..

176
00:14:45,325 --> 00:14:47,533
..you will have to change that
when you go to Mumbai.

177
00:14:50,783 --> 00:14:53,616
Well. Take this.

178
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,825
What is this? - It's a calendar.

179
00:14:56,741 --> 00:14:58,200
Read it.

180
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,825
And this is a diary.

181
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,991
Dear, I just want you to begin a new life.

182
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:12,408
And record each moment
of your life in this diary. Okay?

183
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:15,033
Yes, mom. I will write. Anything else?

184
00:15:16,366 --> 00:15:20,366
And yes, tell Pia I miss her a lot.

185
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,116
Yes, mom.

186
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:26,825
Mumbai, yeah!

187
00:15:37,908 --> 00:15:39,075
Come on.

188
00:15:39,158 --> 00:15:40,866
Coming, Pia. Two minutes.

189
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,116
And how is it going in Jaipur?

190
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,325
Everything is fine.
Jaipur is still the same old Jaipur.

191
00:15:48,908 --> 00:15:50,950
How are mom and dad?
- Very well. Very good.

192
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,366
Yeah? - Excuse me.

193
00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:57,700
Gul, whose call was it?

194
00:15:57,783 --> 00:16:00,075
Two hours ago he was my boyfriend.

195
00:16:00,783 --> 00:16:02,116
You will never change.

196
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,158
Pia, I am Gul. Not the government.

197
00:16:06,408 --> 00:16:08,908
Okay. Why don't we go home and talk?

198
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:12,908
No, Carol. We won't go home.
It's my first day in Mumbai.

199
00:16:12,991 --> 00:16:14,116
It's my first night.

200
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,075
We have to go out, get drunk and party.

201
00:16:20,116 --> 00:16:22,033
Cheers. - Cheers.

202
00:16:30,575 --> 00:16:31,783
Gul.

203
00:16:34,491 --> 00:16:37,450
Today's drinking is so much fun.

204
00:16:39,116 --> 00:16:42,866
Life is dirty without liquor.

205
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,325
Dirty.

206
00:16:45,408 --> 00:16:46,950
Stop, Carol.

207
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:50,075
She has got bad. Carol has got bad.

208
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,283
Stop. Stop. Stop.

209
00:16:58,908 --> 00:17:00,116
Come on.

210
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,991
Wow! - Come on.

211
00:17:02,408 --> 00:17:04,533
Gul, wait. - Friend..

212
00:17:04,616 --> 00:17:06,116
Oh, God.

213
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,533
Why is everyone hushing us?

214
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:11,200
Come on. - It's heavy.

215
00:17:12,283 --> 00:17:15,158
We are too drunk.
- Pia, it's a very heavy bag.

216
00:17:15,241 --> 00:17:16,366
Come on. - Man.

217
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,658
Come on. - Oh, God.

218
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,283
Come on. - Move.

219
00:17:20,366 --> 00:17:23,408
I have the key.

220
00:17:27,116 --> 00:17:28,575
Move, Pia.

221
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:31,616
I will open it.

222
00:17:32,408 --> 00:17:34,825
Both of you hold the door.
The door is moving.

223
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,575
The door is moving.

224
00:17:36,658 --> 00:17:37,991
Hold the door.

225
00:17:42,658 --> 00:17:43,825
Look, I opened it.

226
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,700
Gul, we are so lucky.

227
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:49,075
If Gul had not been there..

228
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:52,075
Are you okay, Carol?

229
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:59,075
Carol, what a house!

230
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:02,450
You have not seen anything.

231
00:18:02,533 --> 00:18:05,158
You know? There is a pool.

232
00:18:05,241 --> 00:18:08,658
And there is Jacuzzi too. - Wow!

233
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,408
Okay. You must enjoy.

234
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:14,783
Okay. Your room is there.

235
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,033
Gul.

236
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:27,741
Gul.

237
00:18:29,825 --> 00:18:32,700
You don't want to go to office?
It's your first day.

238
00:18:32,783 --> 00:18:34,075
Oh, no.

239
00:18:34,158 --> 00:18:35,366
What's the time?

240
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,408
It's 10 o'clock. - Where is Pia?

241
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,366
She is sleeping. I am going to my spa.

242
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,700
Oh, no.

243
00:18:43,283 --> 00:18:45,450
Okay. Okay. Let's get ready fast.

244
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,283
Pia. Pia.

245
00:18:51,366 --> 00:18:53,075
Pia, get up.

246
00:18:53,158 --> 00:18:55,658
Gul, let me sleep. - Pia, it is 11 o'clock.

247
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,991
I had to reach office at 10 o'clock.

248
00:18:57,075 --> 00:18:58,908
I will be in trouble
on the first day itself.

249
00:18:59,491 --> 00:19:01,741
Don't worry, Gul.
I will talk to Vivek sir.

250
00:19:01,825 --> 00:19:03,033
You go. I am coming.

251
00:19:03,116 --> 00:19:04,450
Are you sure?

252
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:06,408
Okay. I am taking your car. Okay?

253
00:19:06,783 --> 00:19:08,116
Okay. Bye.

254
00:20:01,616 --> 00:20:02,700
Excuse me. - Yes.

255
00:20:02,783 --> 00:20:04,033
Where is Mr. Vivek's cabin?

256
00:20:04,116 --> 00:20:06,158
Are you a model? - No.

257
00:20:06,241 --> 00:20:08,450
Mr. Vivek's cabin is ahead.

258
00:20:08,533 --> 00:20:10,033
Go straight and turn right.

259
00:20:10,116 --> 00:20:11,450
Okay. - Thank you.

260
00:20:13,283 --> 00:20:14,450
Hello.

261
00:20:15,908 --> 00:20:17,908
I ordered coffee a long time ago.

262
00:20:17,991 --> 00:20:19,575
Will you bring it today?

263
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,200
Yes. Come quickly.

264
00:20:23,741 --> 00:20:25,991
May I come in, sir? - Yeah. Come in.

265
00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:30,116
Hello, sir. This is Gul.

266
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,825
Yeah. Pia told me about you.

267
00:20:33,741 --> 00:20:35,158
Tell me something.

268
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,575
Will you come to office
at this hour every day?

269
00:20:37,658 --> 00:20:40,825
Actually, sir.. - No. No.
You don't have to call me sir.

270
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,241
I am used to working
in a friendly ambiance.

271
00:20:44,366 --> 00:20:48,033
So I guess Vivek is fine. - Okay.

272
00:20:50,033 --> 00:20:51,741
Come. You got time?

273
00:20:51,825 --> 00:20:53,700
It takes you an hour
to bring a cup of coffee.

274
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:54,950
Yes, sir.

275
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,658
He is the spoilt brat of our office.

276
00:20:57,741 --> 00:20:59,200
Delete Singh. - Hello, ma'am.

277
00:20:59,283 --> 00:21:00,700
Delete Singh? - Yes.

278
00:21:01,408 --> 00:21:03,283
Tell her how come
your name is Delete Singh?

279
00:21:03,408 --> 00:21:09,533
Ma'am, it's a tragic story.
Soon after birth, my father got deleted.

280
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:11,116
On my sixth day naming ceremony..

281
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,741
..my grandma got deleted, ma'am.
- Oh, my God.

282
00:21:12,825 --> 00:21:14,116
Wherever I go..

283
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,200
In short, wherever he goes,
somebody gets deleted.

284
00:21:17,283 --> 00:21:19,116
But he proved to be lucky for our company.

285
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,450
Fortunately for us.

286
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:21,700
Okay. - Yes.

287
00:21:21,741 --> 00:21:24,200
Now, leave from here. Come on. - Okay, sir.

288
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,158
Who will take this?
- Sorry, sir. Sorry, sir.

289
00:21:27,241 --> 00:21:28,908
Bye, ma'am. Bye. - Go. Go.

290
00:21:29,491 --> 00:21:31,866
Yeah. I hope you understand
you are very lucky..

291
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,741
..you got a chance to work
in my company. - Yes, sir.

292
00:21:34,783 --> 00:21:36,366
Adi, come in.

293
00:21:36,866 --> 00:21:38,200
Sit.

294
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,450
That's Gul. Adi.

295
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:43,700
Hi. - Hello.

296
00:21:43,741 --> 00:21:44,950
Creative director of the company.

297
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:47,866
And this man is also the
backbone of the company. - Yeah.

298
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,408
Red Chillies' design is ready?

299
00:21:49,491 --> 00:21:51,491
I am working on it.
It will be ready by tomorrow.

300
00:21:51,575 --> 00:21:53,616
I am putting her under
your charge from today.

301
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,825
From today she will assist you. Okay?
- Great.

302
00:21:55,908 --> 00:21:57,658
Fine then, welcome. Congrats.

303
00:21:57,741 --> 00:21:59,575
My pleasure, sir. - You're on.

304
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,158
Come

305
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:05,575
So, if there is anything you need,
just let me know.

306
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:06,908
Sure. Sure.

307
00:22:07,741 --> 00:22:09,283
Hi. - Hi.

308
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,866
So, how are you, Adi?
- I am good. Thanks. You?

309
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,241
I am good too.

310
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:15,408
So how is your first day
in the office, Gul?

311
00:22:15,491 --> 00:22:17,741
Going great so far.
- Yeah? That's really nice.

312
00:22:17,825 --> 00:22:20,033
So how did you find Gul?

313
00:22:20,116 --> 00:22:21,491
She seems nice enough.

314
00:22:21,575 --> 00:22:23,033
We will see how she does in the office.

315
00:22:23,116 --> 00:22:24,866
I am sure she is going to do well.

316
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:27,450
She is my friend, after all. - Yeah.

317
00:22:28,325 --> 00:22:31,866
Anyway, you guys carry on.
I will see you later. Yeah?

318
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,741
You witch..

319
00:23:03,491 --> 00:23:05,783
'I am writing this diary only because..'

320
00:23:05,866 --> 00:23:08,408
'..my mom wants me to maintain a diary.'

321
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:10,700
'My first day in office today.'

322
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,408
Gul.

323
00:24:50,491 --> 00:24:51,825
Hi, mom. How are you?

324
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:54,283
I am fine. You tell me.

325
00:24:54,408 --> 00:24:56,783
I told you to call me up
after you reach office.

326
00:24:56,866 --> 00:24:57,991
I am so sorry, mom.

327
00:24:58,075 --> 00:24:59,866
I was very busy with office work.

328
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:04,116
You always make excuses.
Your papa misses you a lot.

329
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,950
Okay. Tell me. How is your office?

330
00:25:07,366 --> 00:25:09,741
Very good, mom.
Even my boss is very friendly.

331
00:25:09,783 --> 00:25:10,950
Gul.

332
00:25:11,033 --> 00:25:12,700
Okay, mom. I got to go. Pia is calling me.

333
00:25:12,741 --> 00:25:13,866
I am very late for office.

334
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,116
Listen. Listen. Listen.

335
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,575
Gul, did you start writing in the diary?

336
00:25:18,658 --> 00:25:21,075
Yes, mom. I have filled six pages.

337
00:25:21,158 --> 00:25:23,575
Very good. Keep writing.

338
00:25:23,658 --> 00:25:25,825
You have thrust your nuisance on me.

339
00:25:25,908 --> 00:25:27,866
But I am enjoying it.
It's going okay. - Gul.

340
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,075
Okay, mom. I have to go. - Are you ready?

341
00:25:29,158 --> 00:25:31,366
Okay? Bye. Bye.
- Okay, dear. Take care of yourself.

342
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,741
Bye. - Bye.

343
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:34,575
I am ready. I just have to
change and come. - Alright.

344
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:35,908
Okay. - Hey, girls. - Hey.

345
00:25:35,991 --> 00:25:38,866
Hey. - I have movie tickets. Let' go.

346
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,741
I can't come. This evening
I have to go for Umbrella..

347
00:25:41,783 --> 00:25:43,991
..Creations' press conference
with Vivek sir and Adi.

348
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,616
Pia, you will come, won't you?

349
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,991
No, sweetheart.
Even I have to meet my old friends.

350
00:25:49,408 --> 00:25:51,866
But you can do one thing. - What?

351
00:25:52,783 --> 00:25:55,283
Go with Aakash. - Who is Aakash?

352
00:25:55,408 --> 00:25:56,825
You don't know Aakash (Sky)?

353
00:25:56,908 --> 00:25:59,741
I know. It's above. - Correct.

354
00:25:59,783 --> 00:26:03,450
He is always above her.
She is Aakash's ground.

355
00:26:06,866 --> 00:26:08,075
Thank you. - Yes, sir.

356
00:26:08,158 --> 00:26:09,950
Hi. - Come.

357
00:26:10,033 --> 00:26:11,408
Baby, where were you?

358
00:26:11,491 --> 00:26:13,575
You said you will come
in ten minutes. See this.

359
00:26:13,658 --> 00:26:15,283
Whole 25 minutes have passed.

360
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:18,825
You are always late.
I have finished dinner. And see this.

361
00:26:18,908 --> 00:26:20,033
Bill has also arrived.

362
00:26:20,116 --> 00:26:23,033
I am so sorry, darling.
You had dinner? - Yes.

363
00:26:23,116 --> 00:26:25,075
Let's go. - Hang on.

364
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:28,825
I have to pay the bill.
- Let it be. Let it be.

365
00:26:28,908 --> 00:26:30,283
Seriously? - Let it be.

366
00:26:30,408 --> 00:26:31,575
Sure?

367
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:53,908
Hello.

368
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,700
Hello.

369
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,450
Hi.

370
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,783
I am Xavier. I hope you all know me.

371
00:27:16,283 --> 00:27:17,700
You know me.

372
00:27:17,741 --> 00:27:19,700
You must also know that
for the past 20 years..

373
00:27:19,741 --> 00:27:23,658
..our company is the leading
fashion company all over the world.

374
00:27:23,991 --> 00:27:27,741
And for the first time in
20 years our company..

375
00:27:27,783 --> 00:27:31,408
..has decided to work with
Indian designers and stylists.

376
00:27:31,491 --> 00:27:33,366
And whichever company's
designs are selected..

377
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,408
..our company will sign
a contract with them..

378
00:27:35,491 --> 00:27:40,491
..for not one, not two,
not three, but for 10 years.

379
00:27:42,325 --> 00:27:47,866
But you have only ten days for this job.

380
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:50,658
So all the best.

381
00:27:50,741 --> 00:27:53,158
But start the work tomorrow morning.

382
00:27:53,241 --> 00:27:56,741
Right now, go ahead enjoy the party.

383
00:28:08,575 --> 00:28:10,908
Alright? - Definitely.

384
00:28:11,741 --> 00:28:13,366
Careful, Mr. Bajaj.

385
00:28:14,241 --> 00:28:16,158
Hi, Vivek. - Yeah. Hi.

386
00:28:16,241 --> 00:28:20,408
And hello to the pretty lady. Ravi Bajaj.

387
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:23,283
Gul. - Gul? Really nice name.

388
00:28:23,408 --> 00:28:28,366
Thank you. - Ozone Overseas.
It's a small company.

389
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,616
Maybe you have heard the name.

390
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,533
Your style of calling a big company small..

391
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,908
..and thus calling yourself big is great.

392
00:28:34,658 --> 00:28:36,783
You are late, Mr. Bajaj.

393
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:39,866
Umbrella Creations' conference is over.

394
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,158
It doesn't make any difference.

395
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:43,658
He is a victim of overconfidence.

396
00:28:43,741 --> 00:28:46,533
He thinks he is going to get
Umbrella Creations' order.

397
00:28:46,616 --> 00:28:48,575
Continue dreaming, Mr. Bajaj.

398
00:28:49,366 --> 00:28:51,700
This time we will get the order.

399
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,116
Okay.

400
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,116
Anyway, see you. - Sure.

401
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:56,783
All the best.

402
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,408
See you. - Bye.

403
00:28:58,491 --> 00:28:59,866
Let's go. - Yeah.

404
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,908
'Because she loves sex
as much as I do. Okay?'

405
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,033
'Sex is just an activity to you, isn't it?'

406
00:29:08,116 --> 00:29:11,575
Let's utilize our Sunday.
Let's rearrange the furniture.

407
00:29:11,658 --> 00:29:14,075
Actually. Come on, Gul. Let's do it.

408
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,408
Come on, Carol. You have everything.

409
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:18,741
You are so successful.

410
00:29:18,825 --> 00:29:20,866
Hire a maid to do all these chores.

411
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,491
I can afford ten maids.

412
00:29:22,575 --> 00:29:24,700
But one achieves success with..

413
00:29:24,741 --> 00:29:27,408
..patience, honesty and hard work.

414
00:29:27,491 --> 00:29:30,366
That's why I do these
small household chores.

415
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,908
It's not my job.

416
00:29:31,991 --> 00:29:34,575
Even in Jaipur my servants do all this.

417
00:29:34,658 --> 00:29:36,700
I have come to Mumbai to be very famous.

418
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:39,366
And in this small life I have
many great things to do.

419
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,825
I have to go far ahead.

420
00:29:40,908 --> 00:29:43,658
Pia, I don't understand Gul's lifestyle.

421
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,741
You will understand, Carol.

422
00:29:46,825 --> 00:29:48,491
When I will have a bigger
house than you, a car..

423
00:29:48,575 --> 00:29:52,116
..and 25 servants, you will
understand everything.

424
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,741
Come on, Carol. Let's go.

425
00:29:53,783 --> 00:29:55,075
Come on. Let her watch TV.

426
00:29:55,158 --> 00:29:57,908
'And all this on Sunday.'

427
00:29:57,991 --> 00:29:59,575
'Yeah! - Yeah!'

428
00:29:59,658 --> 00:30:00,866
"Forgive.."

429
00:30:02,783 --> 00:30:04,450
Yeah. Come in.

430
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,033
Sir.. - Sit. Sit. Sit.

431
00:30:11,116 --> 00:30:12,991
RB is very confident this time.

432
00:30:13,075 --> 00:30:15,075
It's RB's habit to tell tall tales.

433
00:30:15,158 --> 00:30:17,700
You should never
underestimate your competitor.

434
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:19,033
Right?

435
00:30:21,491 --> 00:30:25,783
I want only Flora Enterprises
to get Umbrella Creations' order.

436
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:30,075
For that we will have to make
such designs that Umbrella Creations..

437
00:30:30,158 --> 00:30:34,700
..signs the next 10 years' agreement
only with our company.

438
00:30:34,741 --> 00:30:37,450
Don't worry, sir. We will try our best.

439
00:30:37,533 --> 00:30:38,825
Not try.

440
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,950
Results.

441
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:42,825
Definitely.

442
00:31:17,866 --> 00:31:19,700
You are working so hard.

443
00:31:19,741 --> 00:31:22,241
It's very late. Go to sleep.

444
00:31:22,325 --> 00:31:24,825
Coming. I will just finish
this and come. Okay?

445
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,741
Hey. - Hey.

446
00:31:40,783 --> 00:31:42,366
I will see you. - Yeah.

447
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:49,825
The designs.

448
00:31:51,116 --> 00:31:52,658
What is this?

449
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,033
Along with your time why are
you wasting our time as well?

450
00:31:57,116 --> 00:31:58,241
But have a look..

451
00:31:58,325 --> 00:32:02,533
If our company starts working on
the sketches made by you..

452
00:32:02,658 --> 00:32:07,116
..we will even stop getting the
few contracts that we have got.

453
00:32:15,158 --> 00:32:16,741
Unbelievable!

454
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,700
Hey. - Hey.

455
00:32:20,241 --> 00:32:21,408
What happened?

456
00:32:21,491 --> 00:32:23,075
There is some problem.

457
00:32:24,908 --> 00:32:26,241
Where are you going?

458
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,991
To have a smoke.

459
00:32:36,741 --> 00:32:38,825
Pia. - Yes, sir.

460
00:32:38,908 --> 00:32:42,825
Where is Gul?
- She must be around in the office.

461
00:32:42,908 --> 00:32:44,200
Where is Adi?

462
00:32:44,908 --> 00:32:47,200
He has gone for a smoke.
- Gone for a smoke.

463
00:32:47,283 --> 00:32:48,700
Alright. Thanks.

464
00:32:57,033 --> 00:32:59,116
Adi. - Hi.

465
00:32:59,491 --> 00:33:00,741
What do you think?

466
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:02,783
By when will Umbrella Creations'
designs be ready?

467
00:33:02,866 --> 00:33:04,408
It will take another three-four days, sir.

468
00:33:04,491 --> 00:33:06,366
The workload is very heavy.

469
00:33:06,908 --> 00:33:08,366
Gul is there to help you.

470
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,450
She must have also prepared some designs.

471
00:33:10,533 --> 00:33:14,825
I have thrown her sketches in the dustbin.

472
00:33:14,908 --> 00:33:17,116
She is new. She will learn gradually.

473
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,616
We should close Flora Enterprises
and start a fashion institute.

474
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,241
Along with Gul
everybody else will also learn.

475
00:33:23,325 --> 00:33:24,533
Hold it. Hold it there.

476
00:33:24,658 --> 00:33:25,991
Just stop kidding.

477
00:33:26,616 --> 00:33:29,408
If she is not talented, sack her.

478
00:33:31,325 --> 00:33:32,700
Throw her out.

479
00:33:32,741 --> 00:33:34,241
You know we are short of time.

480
00:33:34,325 --> 00:33:36,908
It is better you do this job.

481
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,241
Let's see.

482
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,783
'If she is not talented, sack her.'

483
00:34:09,741 --> 00:34:11,200
'Throw her out.'

484
00:34:18,533 --> 00:34:22,533
'I have thrown her sketches
in the dustbin.'

485
00:34:22,616 --> 00:34:24,741
What happened?
You have still not got ready.

486
00:34:24,783 --> 00:34:26,241
What is this?

487
00:34:30,575 --> 00:34:31,866
Who wrote this?

488
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:34,658
Mom. - Your mom is great.

489
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,033
Gul, since the time you have
returned from office..

490
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,491
..you seem very upset.

491
00:34:38,575 --> 00:34:40,200
Today was my last day in office.

492
00:34:40,283 --> 00:34:41,866
What happened? - What?

493
00:34:43,616 --> 00:34:46,908
It's a long story. Come on.
Let's just go out for dinner.

494
00:34:46,991 --> 00:34:48,950
Are you sure, Gul?
- Yeah. I am sure. Come on.

495
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:52,158
Let's just go. - Both of you go.
I am tired. I want to sleep.

496
00:34:52,241 --> 00:34:54,116
You are sure? - Okay. Let's just go.

497
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,616
Alright.

498
00:34:55,908 --> 00:34:57,325
Yes. I will show you.

499
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,575
First let me..

500
00:34:59,658 --> 00:35:01,033
Yes. Yes.

501
00:35:01,116 --> 00:35:03,033
See this. - Show.

502
00:35:09,491 --> 00:35:12,200
I was..

503
00:35:12,283 --> 00:35:13,491
Hello.

504
00:35:13,575 --> 00:35:14,825
Hi.

505
00:35:14,908 --> 00:35:16,241
May I join you?

506
00:35:16,325 --> 00:35:17,700
Great.

507
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:19,283
What are you drinking? - How are you doing?

508
00:35:20,491 --> 00:35:23,158
That's the wine. - Fantastic.

509
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:24,616
Great! - Yeah.

510
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,616
I know I love drinking wine.
So we thought.. - Really?

511
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,325
..we will buy ourselves a wine.

512
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,075
Actually, yes..

513
00:35:31,158 --> 00:35:32,825
And that's my favourite wine.

514
00:35:32,908 --> 00:35:34,366
So how are you feeling in Mumbai? - Yeah.

515
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,783
I think it's good.

516
00:35:35,866 --> 00:35:37,325
I mean, yeah, you know,
as long as I have good friends.

517
00:35:37,408 --> 00:35:38,783
Of course.

518
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,616
Should we go somewhere else?

519
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,116
Yeah.

520
00:35:47,908 --> 00:35:49,700
So goodnight. - So you guys are leaving.

521
00:35:49,783 --> 00:35:50,908
Yeah. I will see you later. Okay?

522
00:35:50,991 --> 00:35:52,158
See you.

523
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:57,033
So Gul, tell me.
What else do you do to wind out?

524
00:35:57,783 --> 00:35:59,991
I mean, I really like the person..

525
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,325
Wow!

526
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,783
Beautiful. Excellent.

527
00:36:43,866 --> 00:36:45,616
Fantastic.

528
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,158
That's really nice.

529
00:36:47,241 --> 00:36:48,575
Adi.

530
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,533
Wonderful! Wonderful!

531
00:36:52,616 --> 00:36:54,616
Did you make this? - No.

532
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,825
Gul has made it.

533
00:36:57,325 --> 00:36:59,325
You were saying she doesn't know anything.

534
00:36:59,408 --> 00:37:00,908
She knows many things.

535
00:37:00,991 --> 00:37:04,783
Okay.
- Actually, I was wrong about her talent.

536
00:37:06,241 --> 00:37:08,533
Rectify your mistake.
She should be promoted.

537
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,700
Where is she? Where is Gul?

538
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:14,075
She was toiling the whole night, sir.

539
00:37:14,408 --> 00:37:15,991
She is sleeping.

540
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,700
Hey, Pia. - Hey.

541
00:37:33,783 --> 00:37:35,491
Hey, Gul. Where were you the whole night?

542
00:37:35,575 --> 00:37:37,700
Don't ask. I saved my job.

543
00:37:37,783 --> 00:37:40,075
That's good. But how?

544
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:44,075
Well, last night I showed my work.
I will be promoted soon.

545
00:37:44,158 --> 00:37:45,866
Congratulations.

546
00:37:46,533 --> 00:37:48,408
So today's dinner is your treat. Okay?

547
00:37:48,491 --> 00:37:49,908
Done. Tell Carol as well.

548
00:37:49,991 --> 00:37:51,325
Cool.

549
00:38:10,283 --> 00:38:11,533
How did you come here?

550
00:38:11,616 --> 00:38:13,616
Wow, Carol! It's amazing!

551
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,241
I also feel like doing something.

552
00:38:15,325 --> 00:38:16,658
Shall I go for a shoulder massage?

553
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,575
Very funny. Go out.
We will meet for dinner.

554
00:38:18,658 --> 00:38:19,950
Okay. Okay. Okay.

555
00:38:20,033 --> 00:38:22,616
We will meet for dinner.
But what about lunch?

556
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,241
I am very busy right now.
I can't. Please go.

557
00:38:25,325 --> 00:38:28,075
Okay. Okay. Okay. Give me some money then.

558
00:38:28,158 --> 00:38:29,491
What? - Yes.

559
00:38:29,575 --> 00:38:31,825
I have to pay the taxi fare,
the newspaper bill.

560
00:38:31,908 --> 00:38:34,075
If I have lunch. I will have to
give a tip to the waiter.

561
00:38:34,158 --> 00:38:35,533
Enough. Enough. Enough.
- After that in the evening we have..

562
00:38:35,616 --> 00:38:36,825
Give me money.

563
00:38:40,783 --> 00:38:43,366
I will take all. How much is it?

564
00:38:43,533 --> 00:38:45,741
I don't know.
I gave you what I had. Please go.

565
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:48,991
Okay, baby. Sweetheart, see you at dinner.

566
00:38:54,116 --> 00:38:56,075
Carol should have come. - Yeah.

567
00:38:56,158 --> 00:38:58,991
I don't know what she does with Aakash.

568
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:01,700
Hey.

569
00:39:02,033 --> 00:39:03,241
Hi.

570
00:39:03,325 --> 00:39:04,491
Come on over.

571
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:06,033
Why don't you sit?
I will just join you in a minute.

572
00:39:06,116 --> 00:39:07,325
Yeah. Sure.

573
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,158
Hi. - Hi. How are you?

574
00:39:11,241 --> 00:39:12,783
Good. How are you? - Have a seat.

575
00:39:12,866 --> 00:39:13,991
Thank you.

576
00:39:14,075 --> 00:39:16,158
Would you like a drink? - No. I am good.

577
00:39:19,241 --> 00:39:21,491
I know your speciality, Gul.

578
00:39:22,825 --> 00:39:25,491
You are handling Umbrella Creations'
account, aren't you?

579
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,908
Yes, Mr. Bajaj.

580
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,033
There is one thing common between us.

581
00:39:33,158 --> 00:39:36,408
A hunger for success.
I can sense that about you.

582
00:39:36,491 --> 00:39:39,158
I see the same hunger in you.

583
00:39:39,241 --> 00:39:41,408
You want to be very, very successful.

584
00:39:42,616 --> 00:39:44,158
Nothing wrong with that.

585
00:39:44,491 --> 00:39:47,908
The only difference is you work too hard.

586
00:39:48,783 --> 00:39:50,491
I have a philosophy.

587
00:39:51,616 --> 00:39:54,700
Party hard. And work smart.

588
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:57,116
For instance this waiter.

589
00:39:57,366 --> 00:40:00,450
How many hours does he work? 10? 12? 14?

590
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:01,825
I mean, I don't know.

591
00:40:01,908 --> 00:40:03,575
How much money does he earn?

592
00:40:03,658 --> 00:40:07,616
Look at me. I work for three to four hours.

593
00:40:08,366 --> 00:40:11,533
And both of us know how much money I earn.

594
00:40:11,991 --> 00:40:13,450
That's why I have an offer for you.

595
00:40:13,533 --> 00:40:15,408
Join my company.

596
00:40:16,075 --> 00:40:18,783
Get my company
Umbrella Creations' contract.

597
00:40:18,866 --> 00:40:20,575
Salary, whatever you want.

598
00:40:20,658 --> 00:40:23,033
A dream house. A dream car.

599
00:40:23,116 --> 00:40:25,116
The works basically.

600
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,700
What do you say to that, Gul?

601
00:40:27,783 --> 00:40:29,825
Thank you. Really. For the offer.

602
00:40:29,908 --> 00:40:31,450
I will think about it.

603
00:40:33,075 --> 00:40:35,325
So I will see you later then. - Okay.

604
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,575
Take care. - Alright.

605
00:40:45,033 --> 00:40:47,116
It was him. Ozone's Mr. Bajaj.

606
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,200
Really? Was it? - Yeah. You didn't know?

607
00:40:50,283 --> 00:40:51,825
No. Not at all.

608
00:41:05,783 --> 00:41:07,700
Vivek. - Hi. How are you?

609
00:41:07,783 --> 00:41:09,158
Good. How are you? - Hi, Vivek sir.

610
00:41:09,241 --> 00:41:11,700
Hi, my mother. - What?

611
00:41:11,783 --> 00:41:13,075
Got hurt?

612
00:41:13,158 --> 00:41:15,366
I will call you mother
whenever you call me sir.

613
00:41:15,908 --> 00:41:17,200
Okay.

614
00:41:17,283 --> 00:41:19,408
Well, Gul, let's leave. - Pia, two minutes.

615
00:41:19,908 --> 00:41:21,408
So how come you are here?

616
00:41:21,491 --> 00:41:23,033
I just came here for dinner.

617
00:41:23,116 --> 00:41:25,200
Anyway, I saw your designs.

618
00:41:25,491 --> 00:41:28,033
Lovely. They are awesome.
- Thank you. Thank you.

619
00:41:28,116 --> 00:41:30,075
You hid the secret for so long.

620
00:41:31,075 --> 00:41:35,533
Well, Vivek,
I tried to show you my designs before.

621
00:41:35,616 --> 00:41:38,116
But.. I couldn't show it.

622
00:41:39,283 --> 00:41:40,825
What do you mean, couldn't show it?

623
00:41:40,908 --> 00:41:42,033
I don't understand.

624
00:41:42,116 --> 00:41:43,991
Shall we meet tomorrow and talk?

625
00:41:44,075 --> 00:41:45,616
Few things I need to tell you.

626
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:48,700
Yeah. Fine. Okay.

627
00:41:48,783 --> 00:41:50,783
Okay. I will see you then. - See you.

628
00:42:03,991 --> 00:42:07,075
Ma'am, hold on. I will give it.

629
00:42:07,991 --> 00:42:09,325
Take this.

630
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:20,700
Sir, here is your lemonade
and honey. And towel.

631
00:42:21,075 --> 00:42:22,325
You didn't bring today's newspaper?

632
00:42:22,408 --> 00:42:24,408
Sir, I am searching for today's
newspaper since yesterday.

633
00:42:24,491 --> 00:42:25,950
Shall I bring yesterday's newspaper?

634
00:42:26,283 --> 00:42:28,450
Yes. If possible,
bring a few years' old newspaper.

635
00:42:28,533 --> 00:42:30,283
Bring 30-40 years' old.
If you can bring it.

636
00:42:30,366 --> 00:42:32,450
Sir, I am reading you
for the past 40 years.

637
00:42:32,533 --> 00:42:35,491
But sir, sorry.
You don't look like you are 40, sir.

638
00:42:35,575 --> 00:42:37,491
Go. - You look a few months younger, sir.

639
00:42:37,575 --> 00:42:39,450
Now, you disappear and
bring the newspaper. Come on.

640
00:42:39,533 --> 00:42:41,700
Sir, not the newspaper
but the news is here.

641
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,116
Yes. Mind your own business. Leave.

642
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,700
I will say good morning to ma'am. - Leave.

643
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:11,283
Good morning, ma'am.
- Delete, you are here too?

644
00:43:11,366 --> 00:43:13,700
I follow sir wherever he goes.

645
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:15,700
Have a seat. Sir is coming. - Okay.

646
00:43:15,783 --> 00:43:17,033
Okay, ma'am.

647
00:43:20,158 --> 00:43:21,366
Hi. - Hi.

648
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:22,700
How did you come here suddenly?

649
00:43:22,783 --> 00:43:24,700
I told you yesterday I will meet you today.

650
00:43:24,783 --> 00:43:25,908
Yes. Right. Have a seat. - Okay.

651
00:43:25,991 --> 00:43:27,158
You came at the right time.

652
00:43:27,241 --> 00:43:28,616
Otherwise I was going to leave soon.

653
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:33,158
Well, my mother says
time favours those who value it.

654
00:43:33,241 --> 00:43:34,408
Does she? - Yes.

655
00:43:34,491 --> 00:43:35,866
Your mother is very intelligent.

656
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:37,575
If I get a chance,
I would like to meet her.

657
00:43:37,658 --> 00:43:39,200
For sure.

658
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,491
Tell me. What will you have?

659
00:43:40,575 --> 00:43:42,783
I am good, sir. I had breakfast just now.

660
00:43:42,866 --> 00:43:46,283
If you will call me sir here,
you know what I am going to say.

661
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,866
I know. I know. Mother.

662
00:43:49,866 --> 00:43:54,200
Anyway. I saw your designs.
You seem very talented.

663
00:43:54,616 --> 00:43:57,408
But why did you take so much time
to express your talent?

664
00:43:58,241 --> 00:43:59,950
I didn't take time, Vivek.

665
00:44:00,408 --> 00:44:03,616
Those whom you trust a lot, they took time.

666
00:44:04,116 --> 00:44:05,950
My designs were ready since a long time.

667
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,908
What do you mean? Who?

668
00:44:10,075 --> 00:44:11,991
I don't want to take anybody's name.

669
00:44:13,783 --> 00:44:16,408
Fine. Don't take names. I understand a bit.

670
00:44:16,491 --> 00:44:21,450
But Gul, if I trust someone,
I trust him completely.

671
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,866
What if somebody breaks your trust?

672
00:44:26,158 --> 00:44:27,491
It hasn't happened so far.

673
00:44:27,575 --> 00:44:31,200
If it happens,
I wouldn't want to see his face again.

674
00:44:33,033 --> 00:44:34,783
Can you do that? - Yeah, of course.

675
00:44:34,866 --> 00:44:40,700
If I trust my employees,
it's their duty to uphold my trust.

676
00:44:40,825 --> 00:44:42,533
And not break it.

677
00:44:42,616 --> 00:44:45,241
It's your duty to live up to my trust.

678
00:44:45,325 --> 00:44:46,741
I understand.

679
00:44:46,783 --> 00:44:48,241
It's simple.

680
00:44:48,325 --> 00:44:52,200
If I take care of people,
they should also take care of me.

681
00:44:52,283 --> 00:44:53,616
Of course.

682
00:44:54,908 --> 00:44:56,408
So I guess.

683
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:59,325
A hand searches for another hand.

684
00:45:00,116 --> 00:45:02,033
I hope you understand what I am saying.

685
00:45:03,408 --> 00:45:04,783
I will see you in the office. - Yeah. Sure.

686
00:45:04,866 --> 00:45:06,033
Bye.

687
00:45:07,075 --> 00:45:09,408
Sir, newspaper is here.

688
00:45:09,491 --> 00:45:11,116
Keep it in the car. I have to go to office.

689
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,241
Yes, sir. - I am coming. Go.

690
00:45:12,325 --> 00:45:13,616
Yes, sir.

691
00:45:41,033 --> 00:45:43,575
Adi, come into my cabin.

692
00:45:45,783 --> 00:45:47,200
Yeah. Come in.

693
00:45:49,491 --> 00:45:51,158
Did I ask you to sit?

694
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,950
You have so disappointed me, Adi.
It's not funny.

695
00:46:01,116 --> 00:46:02,700
I had never imagined that I will have to..

696
00:46:02,783 --> 00:46:04,283
..hear something like this about you.

697
00:46:04,366 --> 00:46:07,866
Let me tell you.
This is the last time I am hearing this.

698
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:09,200
I don't understand, sir.

699
00:46:09,283 --> 00:46:11,450
Nothing is left for you to understand.

700
00:46:12,116 --> 00:46:13,825
Tell me the truth.

701
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,866
Sorry, sir. I still don't understand.

702
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:20,533
Fine. No problem.
If that's the way you want to play.

703
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,491
Let me tell you something.
I know everything.

704
00:46:23,575 --> 00:46:25,991
When you threw away
Gul's design the first time..

705
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:28,658
..that is when I understood
you have some game plan.

706
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,950
Sir, actually then..

707
00:46:30,033 --> 00:46:33,783
Lie remains a lie regardless of
how many times you speak it.

708
00:46:33,866 --> 00:46:35,533
Please, sir. Listen to me.

709
00:46:35,616 --> 00:46:38,241
I don't want people like you
who exploit in my company.

710
00:46:38,325 --> 00:46:40,825
Exploit. - Don't waste my time, Adi.

711
00:46:40,908 --> 00:46:43,908
I don't need players like you.
You can leave.

712
00:46:43,991 --> 00:46:45,491
You are fired.

713
00:46:46,658 --> 00:46:47,866
Fine, sir.

714
00:46:48,408 --> 00:46:50,283
It will take you some time to understand..

715
00:46:50,366 --> 00:46:52,241
..who the actual player is.

716
00:46:52,325 --> 00:46:53,700
That too an expert player.

717
00:46:53,783 --> 00:46:55,158
Get out of here.

718
00:46:57,158 --> 00:47:00,825
It's said it is okay if a man
doesn't have a bank balance.

719
00:47:00,908 --> 00:47:02,908
But it's very important to have brains.

720
00:47:02,991 --> 00:47:04,325
Get out I said.

721
00:47:05,158 --> 00:47:06,241
Out.

722
00:47:06,325 --> 00:47:07,950
Good day, Mr. Vivek.

723
00:47:13,241 --> 00:47:14,450
Gul.

724
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:17,908
From today you will handle
Umbrella Creations' account.

725
00:47:17,991 --> 00:47:19,158
Okay?

726
00:47:19,825 --> 00:47:21,116
Yes, sir.

727
00:47:21,408 --> 00:47:22,825
Thank you, sir. - Yeah.

728
00:47:28,158 --> 00:47:30,783
I need money desperately, Carol.

729
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:34,783
Pia.

730
00:47:34,866 --> 00:47:36,575
Who is with Carol?

731
00:47:37,241 --> 00:47:38,575
Who? Him?

732
00:47:41,408 --> 00:47:43,283
He is her boyfriend.

733
00:47:43,825 --> 00:47:45,241
What is he doing?

734
00:47:45,325 --> 00:47:46,491
It's their everyday's scene.

735
00:47:46,575 --> 00:47:47,783
She is giving him money.

736
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:50,533
Amazing!
Other men sustain their girlfriends.

737
00:47:50,616 --> 00:47:51,783
And she is sustaining her boyfriend.

738
00:47:51,866 --> 00:47:53,116
Forget it.

739
00:47:54,866 --> 00:47:56,741
Thank you, baby. I am leaving.

740
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:58,366
See you.

741
00:47:58,866 --> 00:48:00,366
Bye. - Bye.

742
00:48:13,908 --> 00:48:15,116
Come on.

743
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,700
Pia told me you slept with Adi.
Only to save your job.

744
00:48:18,825 --> 00:48:20,741
What kind of girl you are? - Talented.

745
00:48:20,783 --> 00:48:23,575
You think it's a talent to
spend the night with someone?

746
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,075
What else?

747
00:48:26,408 --> 00:48:27,700
See Pia, Carol.

748
00:48:27,825 --> 00:48:30,116
She is working as an accountant
for the past five years.

749
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,325
She is still at the same place
from where she had started.

750
00:48:32,408 --> 00:48:33,575
Look at me.

751
00:48:33,658 --> 00:48:36,158
In such a short period I have
become the creative director.

752
00:48:37,075 --> 00:48:39,533
But for that you had to stoop so low.

753
00:48:40,325 --> 00:48:42,533
If you are eyeing big dreams..

754
00:48:43,991 --> 00:48:45,908
..you have to stoop low.

755
00:48:46,616 --> 00:48:48,616
Your chemistry is beyond me.

756
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,491
You understand Aakash's chemistry.

757
00:48:51,575 --> 00:48:54,616
Your darling Aakash acts smugly.

758
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,825
He extracts money from you.

759
00:48:56,908 --> 00:48:59,033
Is it his father's earning?

760
00:48:59,616 --> 00:49:01,366
See, this is my personal matter.

761
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:03,700
I have not posted my
personal matter on the net.

762
00:49:03,825 --> 00:49:05,575
This is my personal matter too.

763
00:49:08,283 --> 00:49:12,033
She is soaring high.
She will fall down very soon.

764
00:49:23,241 --> 00:49:27,116
Madam, yesterday's movie was just amazing.

765
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,700
It had our model.

766
00:49:29,658 --> 00:49:30,700
What is happening in this office?

767
00:49:30,741 --> 00:49:31,825
Oh God, sir is here.
- What's going on here?

768
00:49:31,908 --> 00:49:34,116
What are you doing?
Come on, get back to work.

769
00:49:35,033 --> 00:49:38,116
Where is Gul? Send Gul.

770
00:49:38,491 --> 00:49:40,408
Sir, shall I get coffee? - Shut up.

771
00:49:42,241 --> 00:49:43,616
Get on with your work.

772
00:49:56,033 --> 00:49:57,366
Did you call me?

773
00:49:58,033 --> 00:49:59,533
Do what know what happened?

774
00:49:59,616 --> 00:50:00,700
I don't know.

775
00:50:00,825 --> 00:50:03,408
How did RB get the orders that
our company was supposed to get?

776
00:50:03,491 --> 00:50:05,783
I don't know. - Yes.
Then who is supposed to know this?

777
00:50:06,616 --> 00:50:08,200
Who is supposed to know this?

778
00:50:09,866 --> 00:50:12,075
You have ruined all my expectations.

779
00:50:12,158 --> 00:50:15,158
And I have no place for
people like you in my office.

780
00:50:15,241 --> 00:50:16,700
You can leave.

781
00:50:17,575 --> 00:50:18,866
What are you looking at?

782
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:21,575
Get out. Get lost.

783
00:50:23,658 --> 00:50:25,033
Out.

784
00:50:46,158 --> 00:50:48,741
Is Mr. Bajaj there? - Yes. Come in.

785
00:51:00,116 --> 00:51:02,575
Gul. Welcome. - Hi.

786
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:07,241
Gul, I have told you before.

787
00:51:07,325 --> 00:51:08,825
I just love the name.

788
00:51:08,908 --> 00:51:11,991
I mean what a beautiful name
and what a beautiful lady.

789
00:51:12,075 --> 00:51:13,825
Thank you for the compliment.

790
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:19,908
The compliment seems good
if the one accepting it is good.

791
00:51:20,491 --> 00:51:21,575
Thank you once again.

792
00:51:21,658 --> 00:51:23,283
No. Thanks to you.

793
00:51:23,825 --> 00:51:27,158
Our company got such a big
contract all thanks to you.

794
00:51:27,241 --> 00:51:28,450
You did an amazing job.

795
00:51:28,533 --> 00:51:29,658
Well done.

796
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,200
Thank you, Mr. Bajaj.

797
00:51:31,283 --> 00:51:33,241
But as far the information I have..

798
00:51:33,325 --> 00:51:36,533
..your company didn't try
as hard to get this contract..

799
00:51:36,616 --> 00:51:37,741
..as our company.

800
00:51:37,825 --> 00:51:40,450
I mean Flora Enterprises did.

801
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,158
Why are you saying so?

802
00:51:43,116 --> 00:51:44,700
Before you came after the party was over..

803
00:51:44,741 --> 00:51:47,075
..for Xavier's party.

804
00:51:47,241 --> 00:51:49,366
If you would've needed
the contract that badly..

805
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:51,158
..you would've come on time.

806
00:51:52,866 --> 00:51:54,241
I'm proud of you.

807
00:51:54,533 --> 00:51:58,450
Brilliant. I am glad that I
chose you for my company.

808
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:00,408
Thank you.

809
00:52:00,491 --> 00:52:03,075
But now that we are on this,
tell me something.

810
00:52:03,158 --> 00:52:06,366
The thing that you should've
started earlier, you..

811
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,366
That's a different story.

812
00:52:09,241 --> 00:52:13,200
That night, Vivek told me that
I am victim of over confidence.

813
00:52:14,116 --> 00:52:16,575
Only his company will get this contract.

814
00:52:17,491 --> 00:52:19,116
Do you remember? - Of course?

815
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,741
I wanted to remind him of his place.

816
00:52:23,616 --> 00:52:26,241
I wanted to put that
arrogant rascal in his place.

817
00:52:26,533 --> 00:52:28,575
That's why I gave you this job.

818
00:52:30,658 --> 00:52:34,491
Well, I successfully completed
the job you gave me.

819
00:52:34,575 --> 00:52:35,866
It's your turn.

820
00:52:37,075 --> 00:52:39,908
The people who know me also know that..

821
00:52:39,991 --> 00:52:43,033
..when I make a promise, I do keep it.

822
00:52:45,241 --> 00:52:47,908
So here goes.

823
00:52:49,033 --> 00:52:50,866
Here are your car keys.

824
00:52:52,575 --> 00:52:55,575
And this is your house key.

825
00:52:55,741 --> 00:52:58,741
No. no. I mean your bungalow's keys.

826
00:52:58,783 --> 00:53:01,116
Thank you. - You're welcome.

827
00:53:01,616 --> 00:53:04,658
And there is one more surprise for you.

828
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,950
This. The key of one more car.

829
00:53:12,283 --> 00:53:14,200
You'll go to work in that car.

830
00:53:14,366 --> 00:53:16,408
You need to go around, isn't it?

831
00:53:17,283 --> 00:53:18,741
So here goes.

832
00:53:19,575 --> 00:53:21,408
Thank you, Mr. Bajaj.

833
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:25,658
And welcome to the organization.

834
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,200
See you. - See you in the morning. Alright?

835
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:42,116
I hope and pray that you
come to your sense very soon.

836
00:53:43,116 --> 00:53:46,033
I am afraid your arrogance might ruin you.

837
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,741
I had told you against
coming here, didn't I?

838
00:54:00,783 --> 00:54:03,991
Carol, your spa is very romantic.

839
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:05,783
There is a spark in here.

840
00:54:05,866 --> 00:54:08,241
So I thought of romancing here.

841
00:54:08,325 --> 00:54:10,158
What are you doing?

842
00:54:11,033 --> 00:54:13,575
Let's go out somewhere if not here, Carol.

843
00:54:13,658 --> 00:54:15,033
I am on duty. Go.

844
00:54:15,116 --> 00:54:16,783
You work every day, Carol.

845
00:54:16,866 --> 00:54:18,200
Sometimes work for me too.

846
00:54:18,283 --> 00:54:19,491
Think about me too.

847
00:54:19,575 --> 00:54:21,700
I also need money. - I said I am working.

848
00:54:21,783 --> 00:54:23,158
Leave.

849
00:54:35,366 --> 00:54:36,783
Hello Gul. - What are you doing?

850
00:54:36,866 --> 00:54:37,991
What are you doing?

851
00:54:38,075 --> 00:54:39,950
Still in the office. I am very busy.

852
00:54:40,033 --> 00:54:41,491
The workload is immense.

853
00:54:41,575 --> 00:54:43,450
Okay. I got some breaking news for you.

854
00:54:43,533 --> 00:54:46,658
I have joined Ravi Bajaj's company
with Xavier's order.

855
00:54:47,116 --> 00:54:49,616
Congrats. - Yes. Thank you.

856
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:50,866
And second good news.

857
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:53,991
I have got a new house and
a new car from the company.

858
00:54:54,075 --> 00:54:56,741
You, Carol and me are going to
go out and party tonight.

859
00:54:56,825 --> 00:54:58,908
Treat is one. Okay. So come home quickly.

860
00:54:58,991 --> 00:55:00,075
Okay. You guys carry on.

861
00:55:00,158 --> 00:55:01,408
I'll see if I can catch you later.

862
00:55:01,533 --> 00:55:03,325
Yes? - Oh. I'll miss you.

863
00:55:03,408 --> 00:55:04,908
Okay. Bye.

864
00:55:09,366 --> 00:55:11,325
Hey Carol, where are you?

865
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:12,741
I am upstairs in my room.

866
00:55:12,825 --> 00:55:14,700
I am in the pool. I have some good news.

867
00:55:14,741 --> 00:55:17,200
Come fast. - Okay, coming. - See you.

868
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:36,575
Hey. - Why are you so happy?

869
00:55:36,658 --> 00:55:38,325
And whose cars are those outside?

870
00:55:38,408 --> 00:55:39,783
That car is mine.

871
00:55:39,866 --> 00:55:41,866
This was the good news
I wanted to give you.

872
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:43,991
I have joined a new company, Carol.
- Right.

873
00:55:44,075 --> 00:55:46,700
I told you. I will go places.

874
00:55:46,741 --> 00:55:48,700
I am so happy for you.

875
00:55:48,741 --> 00:55:50,283
But I am very upset.

876
00:55:50,366 --> 00:55:51,575
What happened?

877
00:55:51,658 --> 00:55:53,616
Aakash, my boyfriend.

878
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,950
He always wants money from me.

879
00:55:56,033 --> 00:55:58,408
And I am fed up of giving him money.

880
00:55:58,491 --> 00:56:00,825
Oh. Don't worry.

881
00:56:00,908 --> 00:56:02,908
We're going to go out tonight
and we're going to party.

882
00:56:02,991 --> 00:56:04,700
And have fun.

883
00:56:21,033 --> 00:56:23,033
"Go, sisters. Go, sisters."

884
00:56:23,116 --> 00:56:24,908
"Got to party tonight."

885
00:56:24,991 --> 00:56:26,825
"Go, sisters. Go, sisters."

886
00:56:26,908 --> 00:56:28,700
"Got to get a new boy. Yeah."

887
00:56:28,741 --> 00:56:30,575
"Go, sisters. Go, sisters."

888
00:56:30,658 --> 00:56:32,366
"Got to party tonight."

889
00:56:32,491 --> 00:56:34,491
"Go, sisters. Go, sisters."

890
00:56:34,575 --> 00:56:36,325
"Got to get a new boy. Yeah."

891
00:56:36,408 --> 00:56:39,908
"Go. Got to party tonight."

892
00:56:39,991 --> 00:56:43,866
"Go. Got to party tonight."

893
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:46,658
"Boys. To hell with boys."

894
00:56:46,741 --> 00:56:48,533
"We don't need boys."

895
00:56:48,616 --> 00:56:51,491
"We got each other."

896
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:56,033
"Girls. We make the rules.
And break the rules."

897
00:56:56,116 --> 00:56:59,075
"We got each other."

898
00:56:59,158 --> 00:57:02,950
"The boys are naughty.
These boys are naïve."

899
00:57:03,033 --> 00:57:06,658
"Who needs boys?"

900
00:57:06,741 --> 00:57:11,283
"We are having fun.
As it is we are sloshed."

901
00:57:11,408 --> 00:57:14,200
"What else do we want?"

902
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:33,408
"We have to live. And drink carefree."

903
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:36,616
"We'll do as we please."

904
00:57:37,033 --> 00:57:38,908
"This world is smitten by us."

905
00:57:38,991 --> 00:57:41,075
"The evening comes alive because of us."

906
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:44,325
"We'll groove, sing and dance."

907
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,825
"What time will you come?"

908
00:57:46,908 --> 00:57:48,741
"With whom will you go?"

909
00:57:48,783 --> 00:57:51,741
"Why was the phone switched off?"

910
00:57:52,325 --> 00:57:54,200
"Why took you so long shopping?"

911
00:57:54,283 --> 00:57:56,366
"Why go jogging so early?"

912
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:58,700
"Why the unnecessary fuss?"

913
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:00,241
"Say what?"

914
00:58:00,325 --> 00:58:02,658
"Boys. To hell with boys."

915
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,616
"We don't need boys."

916
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:07,658
"We got each other."

917
00:58:07,741 --> 00:58:12,241
"Girls. We make the rules.
And break the rules."

918
00:58:12,325 --> 00:58:15,283
"We got each other."

919
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:19,116
"The boys are naughty.
These boys are naïve."

920
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,825
"Who needs boys?"

921
00:58:22,908 --> 00:58:27,491
"We are having fun.
As it is we are sloshed."

922
00:58:27,575 --> 00:58:31,033
"What else do we want?"

923
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,991
"Got to party tonight."

924
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,908
"They are liars as well."

925
00:58:58,991 --> 00:59:00,908
"They sleep like a log."

926
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:04,491
"They'll never hear you completely."

927
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,616
"They do as they please."

928
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,283
They fight like kids.

929
00:59:08,366 --> 00:59:12,116
"And then they make innocent faces."

930
00:59:12,658 --> 00:59:16,200
"You've been missing since
two days in this monsoon.."

931
00:59:16,283 --> 00:59:19,533
"..and in the season of romance

932
00:59:19,908 --> 00:59:22,075
"All the wining. All the dining."

933
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:26,866
"All the smelling.
But you still look for other options."

934
00:59:27,741 --> 00:59:29,533
"Boys. No."

935
00:59:29,616 --> 00:59:33,575
"The boys are naughty.
These boys are naïve."

936
00:59:33,658 --> 00:59:37,116
"Who needs boys?"

937
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,825
"We are having fun.
As it is we are sloshed."

938
00:59:41,908 --> 00:59:44,658
"What else do we want?"

939
00:59:44,783 --> 00:59:48,741
"The boys are naughty.
These boys are naïve."

940
00:59:48,825 --> 00:59:52,241
"Who needs boys?"

941
00:59:52,325 --> 00:59:56,991
"We are having fun.
As it is we are sloshed."

942
00:59:57,075 --> 00:59:59,575
"What else do we want?"

943
00:59:59,658 --> 01:00:04,075
Carol. Carol. - "Go sisters.
Go sisters. Got to party tonight."

944
01:00:11,075 --> 01:00:15,075
When I asked money from you,
you said you don't have.

945
01:00:15,158 --> 01:00:17,616
And this party and drama here.

946
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:18,908
What's all that?

947
01:00:18,991 --> 01:00:20,825
I want you to earn.

948
01:00:22,158 --> 01:00:27,075
Look, I want money. Give me money.

949
01:00:27,158 --> 01:00:29,116
Aakash, I can't.

950
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,783
You can't?

951
01:00:31,741 --> 01:00:33,158
You hit me?

952
01:00:33,241 --> 01:00:34,408
Yes, I did.

953
01:00:34,491 --> 01:00:35,741
What the hell are you doing?

954
01:00:35,783 --> 01:00:36,950
Aren't you ashamed?

955
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:39,200
Look, this is our personal matter.

956
01:00:39,283 --> 01:00:41,616
Come, baby.
- Oh, just shut up and don't touch her.

957
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:43,200
Don't make the mistake
of coming here again.

958
01:00:43,283 --> 01:00:45,116
Get it? Get lost. Rascal.

959
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,866
Come on, Carol. - Carol. Carol.

960
01:00:54,366 --> 01:00:55,866
Go to sleep, Carol.

961
01:00:55,950 --> 01:00:57,158
I also have to wake up early tomorrow.

962
01:00:57,241 --> 01:00:59,033
I have to do the shifting and packing.

963
01:00:59,366 --> 01:01:02,533
You sleep, Gul. I can't sleep.

964
01:01:02,616 --> 01:01:04,908
As it is, you have to
go from here in the morning.

965
01:01:04,991 --> 01:01:06,450
And not me.

966
01:01:06,533 --> 01:01:08,033
All I can do is sleep.

967
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:16,700
Carol, why are you sounding so pessimistic?

968
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:20,116
There are only problems in my night.

969
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,533
And no one has the solution.

970
01:01:22,616 --> 01:01:24,658
Do you know what your problem is?

971
01:01:25,325 --> 01:01:28,658
You show your wounds to
the ones who don't have a remedy.

972
01:01:29,491 --> 01:01:32,616
And they make fun of you
upon hearing your problem.

973
01:01:33,991 --> 01:01:37,950
My mother says your best friend
is the mirror in the house.

974
01:01:38,991 --> 01:01:41,033
It doesn't laugh when you cry..

975
01:01:41,116 --> 01:01:42,825
..but cries along with you.

976
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,950
What do I do, Gul?

977
01:01:45,033 --> 01:01:46,741
I am at my wits end.

978
01:01:46,825 --> 01:01:48,283
I'll tell you what you should do?

979
01:01:48,866 --> 01:01:51,616
First of all, throw Aakash
out of your life. Carol.

980
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,700
He is having fun with your money.

981
01:01:55,033 --> 01:01:56,325
Can't you see it?

982
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,325
He is torturing you and
you are enduring his torture.

983
01:02:01,658 --> 01:02:03,283
Remember one thing in life.

984
01:02:04,616 --> 01:02:07,450
Tolerating injustice
also helps the tormentor.

985
01:02:07,533 --> 01:02:11,283
How can someone who can't
help himself help someone else?

986
01:02:12,033 --> 01:02:13,658
Don't give up.

987
01:02:14,033 --> 01:02:16,075
Every dark cloud has a silver lining.

988
01:02:16,158 --> 01:02:17,616
You'll see that silver lining.

989
01:02:18,741 --> 01:02:20,200
I'll go now. Okay.

990
01:02:20,283 --> 01:02:22,741
Sleep well. Good night.

991
01:02:32,741 --> 01:02:36,200
Pia, I am going. Where is Carol?

992
01:02:36,283 --> 01:02:37,616
Carol has gone for a shower.

993
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:39,491
But why are you in such a hurry to shift?

994
01:02:39,575 --> 01:02:41,075
The luggage has reached.
The car is waiting.

995
01:02:41,158 --> 01:02:42,241
I must go.

996
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:43,616
Come, drop me. - Come. I'll drop you.

997
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,533
I'll call you in the evening. - Okay.

998
01:02:47,116 --> 01:02:49,491
"You are here somewhere."

999
01:02:49,575 --> 01:02:51,700
"I am here somewhere."

1000
01:02:51,741 --> 01:02:55,950
"But still this distance exists."

1001
01:03:21,825 --> 01:03:24,200
Here. Here we are.

1002
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:26,116
Your Sunday shopping is done.

1003
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,825
Hey! Gul's phone. One second.

1004
01:03:28,658 --> 01:03:29,783
Hello Gul.

1005
01:03:29,866 --> 01:03:31,866
Hi, mother. - Hi, dear.

1006
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:33,741
Mother, I have got a new job.

1007
01:03:33,825 --> 01:03:37,033
And company has given me
a new car and a new bungalow.

1008
01:03:37,116 --> 01:03:38,408
And guess what?

1009
01:03:38,491 --> 01:03:40,366
My house is bang in front
of the race course.

1010
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:42,158
Isn't that amazing?

1011
01:03:42,241 --> 01:03:44,325
Okay. Now you and father
come to me quickly.

1012
01:03:44,408 --> 01:03:47,741
But Gul, how did this happen so quickly?

1013
01:03:47,825 --> 01:03:50,158
Mother, all is well here.

1014
01:03:50,241 --> 01:03:51,741
Life is beautiful.

1015
01:03:51,783 --> 01:03:53,241
Come here.

1016
01:03:53,325 --> 01:03:56,158
I hope you're not doing anything wrong.
- Ramgopal.

1017
01:03:56,408 --> 01:03:59,325
Mother. - Okay. Fine.

1018
01:03:59,408 --> 01:04:00,741
You take care of yourself.

1019
01:04:00,825 --> 01:04:02,200
Okay. I'll see you.

1020
01:04:02,741 --> 01:04:03,783
So..

1021
01:04:03,866 --> 01:04:05,325
It was Gul.

1022
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:09,325
She shifted her job.
A new bungalow and a new car.

1023
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:12,325
I don't like this.

1024
01:04:13,866 --> 01:04:15,866
It's too much too soon.

1025
01:04:36,366 --> 01:04:38,825
'My first day in my dream home in Mumbai.'

1026
01:04:47,533 --> 01:04:53,033
Carol. Carol. Carol.

1027
01:04:55,866 --> 01:04:57,033
Oh no.

1028
01:04:58,491 --> 01:04:59,866
Gul.

1029
01:05:01,366 --> 01:05:02,616
Yes Pia.

1030
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:04,741
Gul, where are you?

1031
01:05:04,866 --> 01:05:08,116
Come fast. Carol.. - What?

1032
01:05:18,783 --> 01:05:20,408
Carol. Nothing's going to happen to you.

1033
01:05:20,533 --> 01:05:21,908
You'll be fine.

1034
01:05:23,283 --> 01:05:24,533
Carol.

1035
01:05:37,408 --> 01:05:39,325
Yes. Okay doctor.

1036
01:05:43,866 --> 01:05:45,825
Pia. Pia, what happened?

1037
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:48,908
Gul, Carol has slit her wrist. - Why?

1038
01:05:48,991 --> 01:05:51,950
You know she is such a big emotional fool.

1039
01:05:52,033 --> 01:05:53,741
She is crazily in love with Aakash.

1040
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,741
Last night she had a fight with Aakash.

1041
01:05:55,825 --> 01:05:58,783
And today she did this to herself. - What?

1042
01:05:58,866 --> 01:06:01,325
I think we'll have to stay with her today.

1043
01:06:01,866 --> 01:06:03,783
Sorry, Pia. I can't stay here.

1044
01:06:03,866 --> 01:06:05,366
What are you saying?

1045
01:06:05,491 --> 01:06:07,366
You mean you don't sympathize
with carol at all, Gul.

1046
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:09,200
What has she done that deserves sympathy?

1047
01:06:09,283 --> 01:06:11,616
He took away her money. Slapped her.

1048
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,950
If it was me,
I would've thrashed that rascal.

1049
01:06:14,033 --> 01:06:16,241
He wouldn't even dare to look at a girl.

1050
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:19,241
But Carol madam. What has she done?

1051
01:06:19,325 --> 01:06:21,950
She was out to kill herself
instead of killing him.

1052
01:06:22,033 --> 01:06:25,741
Pia, I have no time for
an emotional fool like Carol.

1053
01:06:25,825 --> 01:06:28,741
Now I know how selfish you are.

1054
01:06:28,783 --> 01:06:31,366
I am ashamed of calling you my friend.

1055
01:06:32,533 --> 01:06:33,950
Then good luck with being ashamed, Pia.

1056
01:06:34,033 --> 01:06:35,241
I am going.

1057
01:06:57,075 --> 01:06:58,200
Good morning, sir.

1058
01:06:58,283 --> 01:07:00,033
My name is Aditya Singh Rajput.

1059
01:07:00,116 --> 01:07:01,616
Mr. Bajaj has..

1060
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:13,491
You? I mean madam.

1061
01:07:13,575 --> 01:07:15,158
Adi, how do you feel seeing me here?

1062
01:07:15,241 --> 01:07:20,866
I can't believe that you are
Ozone Company's managing director.

1063
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:23,241
But this is the truth.

1064
01:07:23,575 --> 01:07:25,700
You wanted to get me fired, isn't it?

1065
01:07:26,741 --> 01:07:28,700
I got you fired.

1066
01:07:28,783 --> 01:07:31,283
And today you are standing in front of me.

1067
01:07:31,366 --> 01:07:34,325
If I knew that you are here,
I would've never made..

1068
01:07:34,408 --> 01:07:35,741
..the mistake of coming here.

1069
01:07:35,825 --> 01:07:37,366
So rectify your mistake.

1070
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:39,116
And get lost.

1071
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:42,116
I didn't mind what you said
because I consider..

1072
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:45,533
..girls like you to be handicam.

1073
01:07:45,616 --> 01:07:51,158
You wish to touch the sky
by using your beautiful bodies.

1074
01:07:51,241 --> 01:07:55,825
But one day you drop so hard
from their high perch..

1075
01:07:55,908 --> 01:07:58,658
..that even people who are
watching learn a lesson from it.

1076
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:01,158
You're climbing up the ladder very fast.

1077
01:08:01,241 --> 01:08:03,116
And you'll drop to the ground very soon.

1078
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,533
MD madam.

1079
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:07,575
Till then goodbye.

1080
01:08:08,033 --> 01:08:09,325
See you.

1081
01:08:46,241 --> 01:08:47,908
Mr. Bajaj's new formula.

1082
01:08:47,991 --> 01:08:50,450
Anyone he gets smitten by becomes the MD.

1083
01:08:51,283 --> 01:08:53,783
Business as well as an affair.

1084
01:08:53,866 --> 01:08:55,575
And our MD's formula?

1085
01:08:55,658 --> 01:08:57,533
She is visiting every flower
for the nectar.

1086
01:08:57,616 --> 01:09:00,116
Her name should be butterfly and not Gul.

1087
01:09:00,241 --> 01:09:02,991
Pal, this is a well planned
successful scheme.

1088
01:09:14,075 --> 01:09:16,200
'Her name should be butterfly and not Gul.'

1089
01:09:16,283 --> 01:09:17,408
'I consider..'

1090
01:09:17,491 --> 01:09:18,825
'..girls like you to be handicam.'

1091
01:09:18,908 --> 01:09:22,575
'You wish to touch the sky
by using your beautiful bodies.'

1092
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:24,575
'Her name should be butterfly and not Gul.'

1093
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:54,741
'If you have ever hurt someone,
do apologize to him once.'

1094
01:09:55,283 --> 01:09:58,283
"Don't try to be ahead of time."

1095
01:09:58,616 --> 01:10:04,866
'And yes. Don't ever  use
shortcuts to be successful.'

1096
01:10:08,616 --> 01:10:11,075
'Now I know how selfish you are.'

1097
01:10:11,158 --> 01:10:14,491
'I am ashamed of calling you my friend.'

1098
01:10:15,783 --> 01:10:18,491
'I feel I have also made some mistakes.'

1099
01:10:18,575 --> 01:10:20,491
'And some relationships have gone sour.'

1100
01:10:21,241 --> 01:10:24,700
'And now I'll try to fix
those relationships first.

1101
01:10:25,575 --> 01:10:27,366
'Because mother had once said.'

1102
01:10:27,866 --> 01:10:30,700
'Mistake is a single page
in the part of life.'

1103
01:10:30,991 --> 01:10:34,075
'But relationship is a complete book.'

1104
01:10:34,241 --> 01:10:37,241
'So don't lose a full book
for a single page.'

1105
01:10:42,366 --> 01:10:45,950
Here. You look so weak.

1106
01:10:57,241 --> 01:11:01,283
Here. Eat. You are so weak.

1107
01:11:02,741 --> 01:11:05,033
Yes. Yes. Eat. Eat.

1108
01:11:05,116 --> 01:11:06,741
You'll get strength if you eat.

1109
01:11:06,908 --> 01:11:08,866
You'll work hard if you get strength.

1110
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:10,658
You'll earn money if you work hard.

1111
01:11:10,741 --> 01:11:12,491
And he'll enjoy with your money.

1112
01:11:12,575 --> 01:11:14,866
Madam, she is my girlfriend.

1113
01:11:14,950 --> 01:11:16,991
I can eat her or her money.

1114
01:11:17,075 --> 01:11:19,741
It's none of your business.
- Oh, shut up and mind your language.

1115
01:11:20,075 --> 01:11:21,700
I can't believe it, Carol.

1116
01:11:21,741 --> 01:11:23,991
I can't even imagine that
you'll see him again..

1117
01:11:24,075 --> 01:11:25,700
..after all that happened.

1118
01:11:25,741 --> 01:11:27,658
Don't make me angry or..

1119
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:28,866
This is my life.

1120
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:32,200
And who are you to interfere in my life?

1121
01:11:32,408 --> 01:11:34,033
He took away your money.

1122
01:11:34,116 --> 01:11:35,491
He raised his hand on you.

1123
01:11:35,575 --> 01:11:37,283
Compelled you to die. And you say that..

1124
01:11:37,366 --> 01:11:40,700
Shut up. Aakash is my life.

1125
01:11:41,450 --> 01:11:42,616
He can eat me or my money.

1126
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:43,866
It's none of your business.

1127
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:45,908
Oh darling, I love you.

1128
01:11:47,075 --> 01:11:48,700
Why are you still here?

1129
01:11:48,741 --> 01:11:50,075
Get lost.

1130
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:52,741
I am going.

1131
01:11:52,825 --> 01:11:54,991
But I'll definitely
say this before leaving.

1132
01:11:55,075 --> 01:11:57,533
A person must not make so many mistakes..

1133
01:11:57,616 --> 01:11:59,950
..that he is not able to erase them.

1134
01:12:00,116 --> 01:12:01,825
I have also made mistakes.

1135
01:12:01,908 --> 01:12:04,450
That's why I wanted to apologize to you.

1136
01:12:04,616 --> 01:12:09,533
But you know what? It's not worth it.

1137
01:12:31,866 --> 01:12:34,700
Pia. Pia.

1138
01:12:34,783 --> 01:12:41,033
"Get up. Get up. Get up."

1139
01:12:43,991 --> 01:12:50,408
"Get up. Get up. Get up."

1140
01:13:25,575 --> 01:13:28,200
Adi, what are you doing here?

1141
01:13:28,283 --> 01:13:30,325
Who are you to ask me?

1142
01:13:30,408 --> 01:13:31,533
This is not your house anymore.

1143
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:32,700
This is my friend's house.

1144
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:35,575
Friend who? Whose friend?

1145
01:13:38,825 --> 01:13:41,825
You have severed all the ties
of being a friend, Gul.

1146
01:13:41,908 --> 01:13:46,033
Pia, I would've never come here
if I wanted to sever this tie.

1147
01:13:47,325 --> 01:13:49,158
You would've never come, isn't it?

1148
01:13:49,408 --> 01:13:51,950
Gul, I called you here from Jaipur.

1149
01:13:52,033 --> 01:13:53,783
I kept you with me.

1150
01:13:53,950 --> 01:13:56,700
I helped you in establishing your career.

1151
01:13:56,741 --> 01:13:58,325
And what did you do?

1152
01:13:58,408 --> 01:14:00,616
She got rid of me.

1153
01:14:00,991 --> 01:14:05,241
She clipped the wings of the one
who taught her to fly.

1154
01:14:05,325 --> 01:14:07,200
You had also tried doing the same.

1155
01:14:07,283 --> 01:14:08,491
Remember, Adi?

1156
01:14:08,575 --> 01:14:09,950
Don't be smart.

1157
01:14:10,575 --> 01:14:11,741
Just get lost.

1158
01:14:11,825 --> 01:14:13,700
I don't even want to see your face.

1159
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:16,116
Do you think I would like
to see your face after today?

1160
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:17,616
So why are you here?

1161
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:20,200
Actually, I was obsessed
with achieving my goal.

1162
01:14:21,283 --> 01:14:22,950
And the one who have
their sights set on their goal..

1163
01:14:23,033 --> 01:14:24,700
..don't care about the path.

1164
01:14:25,825 --> 01:14:29,283
But today I thought I have hurt
many people on this path.

1165
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,283
I wanted to apologize to you.

1166
01:14:33,908 --> 01:14:37,741
But now I have realized.
You don't deserve this.

1167
01:15:27,741 --> 01:15:28,950
"Hey, who's hungry?"

1168
01:15:33,033 --> 01:15:34,575
Hi Gul. - Karan.

1169
01:15:34,658 --> 01:15:35,825
What's the matter?

1170
01:15:35,908 --> 01:15:37,658
How come you've called up after so long?

1171
01:15:38,616 --> 01:15:40,366
Karan, I need you.

1172
01:15:40,866 --> 01:15:42,700
Can you please come to Mumbai for me?

1173
01:15:42,741 --> 01:15:44,700
Right now. - What happened?

1174
01:15:44,741 --> 01:15:46,700
Is everything alright?

1175
01:15:47,741 --> 01:15:49,366
All is not well, Karan.

1176
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:51,033
I am really lonely.

1177
01:15:51,116 --> 01:15:52,950
I really need you with me.

1178
01:15:53,116 --> 01:15:54,491
Don't worry. Don't worry.

1179
01:15:54,575 --> 01:15:55,866
I'll take the next flight to Mumbai.

1180
01:15:55,950 --> 01:15:57,366
I'll come to the airport to pick you.

1181
01:16:33,033 --> 01:16:36,700
"My Jugni.."

1182
01:16:36,908 --> 01:16:39,491
"My Jugni.."

1183
01:16:39,575 --> 01:16:41,283
"The one who is in love."

1184
01:16:41,366 --> 01:16:43,408
"My Jugni.."

1185
01:16:43,491 --> 01:16:45,491
"My Jugni.."

1186
01:16:45,575 --> 01:16:47,658
"She takes the name.. ."

1187
01:16:47,741 --> 01:16:49,866
"The name of her beloved."

1188
01:16:49,950 --> 01:16:51,783
"She takes the name of her beloved."

1189
01:16:51,866 --> 01:16:55,408
"Like a prayer."

1190
01:16:58,075 --> 01:17:02,991
"Love is sweeter than honey."

1191
01:17:04,366 --> 01:17:09,116
"Youth is for a short time."

1192
01:17:10,658 --> 01:17:15,741
"Your foundation is nothing."

1193
01:17:16,825 --> 01:17:21,283
"Everything else is of no use."

1194
01:17:21,366 --> 01:17:24,908
"My Jugni.."

1195
01:17:24,991 --> 01:17:27,116
"My Jugni.."

1196
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,325
"My Jugni.."

1197
01:17:29,408 --> 01:17:31,366
"She takes the name.. ."

1198
01:17:31,450 --> 01:17:33,700
"The name of her beloved."

1199
01:17:33,783 --> 01:17:35,533
"She takes the name of her beloved."

1200
01:17:35,616 --> 01:17:38,783
"Like a prayer."

1201
01:17:44,241 --> 01:17:49,200
"Youth is short-lived, lets enjoy it."

1202
01:17:50,325 --> 01:17:55,116
"There is no guarantee of life.'

1203
01:17:56,700 --> 01:18:01,700
"Don't waste time."

1204
01:18:02,783 --> 01:18:07,200
"Once youth is gone.."

1205
01:18:07,283 --> 01:18:11,075
"..it will not return."

1206
01:18:11,158 --> 01:18:13,241
"My Jugni.."

1207
01:18:13,325 --> 01:18:15,283
"My Jugni.."

1208
01:18:15,366 --> 01:18:17,200
"She takes the name.. ."

1209
01:18:17,283 --> 01:18:19,741
"The name of her beloved."

1210
01:18:19,783 --> 01:18:21,658
"She takes the name of her beloved."

1211
01:18:21,741 --> 01:18:23,825
"Like a prayer."

1212
01:18:23,908 --> 01:18:27,200
"My Jugni.."

1213
01:18:27,825 --> 01:18:31,408
"My Jugni.."

1214
01:18:31,991 --> 01:18:35,741
"My Jugni.."

1215
01:18:36,116 --> 01:18:40,116
"My Jugni.."

1216
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,033
And that's my house.

1217
01:18:53,033 --> 01:18:57,783
Wow. Wow. Your house is really beautiful.

1218
01:18:57,866 --> 01:18:59,200
Thank you.

1219
01:18:59,283 --> 01:19:01,408
Okay. Why don't you sit?
I'll just change and come. Okay?

1220
01:19:01,491 --> 01:19:02,866
Sure.

1221
01:19:31,366 --> 01:19:32,991
How about we go for a dinner?

1222
01:19:36,033 --> 01:19:38,950
Don't worry. We'll go for dinner as well.

1223
01:22:55,658 --> 01:22:56,950
Karan.

1224
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:03,825
Karan.

1225
01:23:05,241 --> 01:23:06,533
Karan.

1226
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:10,866
Karan.

1227
01:23:12,033 --> 01:23:13,325
Karan.

1228
01:24:18,741 --> 01:24:20,366
Oh. Hi, sweetheart.

1229
01:24:20,450 --> 01:24:22,366
So how is the weather in Mumbai?

1230
01:24:22,825 --> 01:24:25,241
Mumbai's? Where are you, Karan?

1231
01:24:25,325 --> 01:24:26,700
And why are you disconnecting my call?

1232
01:24:26,783 --> 01:24:28,616
Oh. I am so sorry.

1233
01:24:29,783 --> 01:24:32,075
You felt bad that I disconnected your call.

1234
01:24:32,491 --> 01:24:35,491
And darling, what about the 200 times..

1235
01:24:35,575 --> 01:24:37,283
..when you had disconnected my calls?

1236
01:24:37,366 --> 01:24:41,241
What? I thought you loved me.

1237
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:43,241
Why are you doing this?

1238
01:24:43,325 --> 01:24:47,616
Love. Darling, the word love
doesn't sound good coming from you.

1239
01:24:48,616 --> 01:24:53,116
Forget it.
Do call me if you come to Jaipur.

1240
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:57,741
You've showed your
true colors, haven't you?

1241
01:24:58,116 --> 01:25:00,408
And now tell your friends my stories.

1242
01:25:00,575 --> 01:25:01,825
Rascal.

1243
01:25:42,283 --> 01:25:44,991
'This dairy has started to make me uneasy.'

1244
01:25:45,866 --> 01:25:49,533
'These pages filled with black ink
seem like dark nights to me.'

1245
01:25:50,283 --> 01:25:55,200
'And these blank white pages
seem like bright lights.'

1246
01:25:55,866 --> 01:25:59,575
'I had promised mother
that I'll write diary..'

1247
01:25:59,866 --> 01:26:02,033
'..so that I stay connected
to my memories.'

1248
01:26:02,283 --> 01:26:05,075
'And but I think there is
a slight difference between..'

1249
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:07,866
'..promise and memories.'

1250
01:26:08,033 --> 01:26:10,033
'Humans break promises.'

1251
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:13,200
'And memories shatter a human.'

1252
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:16,616
Now I'll have to stop
writing this diary in order to..

1253
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:19,158
..stop myself from falling to pieces.

1254
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:23,950
Hi, mother. - Hi, dear. What a surprise.

1255
01:26:24,575 --> 01:26:27,450
You've called up your mother after so long.

1256
01:26:27,533 --> 01:26:29,450
Or it's me who calls you.

1257
01:26:29,533 --> 01:26:31,575
By the way, what are you doing?

1258
01:26:32,116 --> 01:26:34,575
You must be writing the diary.

1259
01:26:34,658 --> 01:26:38,491
No, mother. And I have
called you up to tell you that..

1260
01:26:38,825 --> 01:26:43,200
..I'll stop writing
this diary from right now.

1261
01:26:43,283 --> 01:26:44,408
But why?

1262
01:26:44,491 --> 01:26:45,908
What I am saying is right, mother.

1263
01:26:46,616 --> 01:26:48,741
I want to get rid of this diary now.

1264
01:26:48,825 --> 01:26:51,866
But what will you gain
if you stop writing the diary, Gul?

1265
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,533
What did I gain even when
I was writing, mother?

1266
01:26:56,408 --> 01:26:59,825
The pages of the diary in which
I would mention the moments of joy.

1267
01:27:00,283 --> 01:27:04,116
Now they're trying to give me pain.
Want to give me tears.

1268
01:27:04,616 --> 01:27:05,866
And now I am not going to let that happen.

1269
01:27:05,950 --> 01:27:10,075
Look Gul, happiness and sorrow
are two sides of the same coin.

1270
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,658
History always repeats itself.

1271
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:14,700
The pages that are you giving you sorrow..

1272
01:27:14,741 --> 01:27:16,908
..will give you joy in the future, dear.

1273
01:27:16,991 --> 01:27:19,908
The diary you're writing is not a diary.

1274
01:27:19,991 --> 01:27:22,408
It's the mirror of your life, dear.

1275
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:25,241
How can a lifeless diary
be a mirror, mother?

1276
01:27:25,783 --> 01:27:27,866
A mirror is a person's heart.

1277
01:27:28,075 --> 01:27:30,033
Good luck with your diary.

1278
01:27:30,491 --> 01:27:31,575
I will not write.

1279
01:27:31,658 --> 01:27:33,533
Gul, come back.

1280
01:27:33,616 --> 01:27:35,450
I can't come back now, mother.

1281
01:27:36,033 --> 01:27:38,991
I have just made my path
that will lead me to success.

1282
01:27:40,075 --> 01:27:44,158
And the path I have taken will end
only once I reach my destination.

1283
01:27:45,325 --> 01:27:47,366
I have a long way to go, mother.

1284
01:27:47,950 --> 01:27:52,866
When I was writing the diary,
I realized the paths have shrunk.

1285
01:27:52,991 --> 01:27:55,033
And I have locked up time.

1286
01:27:55,741 --> 01:27:58,991
I want to release time
by getting rid of this diary.

1287
01:31:20,575 --> 01:31:21,825
Gul,

1288
01:31:24,908 --> 01:31:26,658
Japanese delegates will be
reaching here in a few minutes.

1289
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:27,825
Are all the documents ready?

1290
01:31:27,908 --> 01:31:29,116
Yes, they are.

1291
01:31:29,575 --> 01:31:31,783
I'd appreciate if you
treat office like one.

1292
01:31:31,866 --> 01:31:34,116
Not like some salon.

1293
01:31:34,241 --> 01:31:36,325
Well, office means business.

1294
01:31:36,658 --> 01:31:38,700
And business means profits.

1295
01:31:38,866 --> 01:31:41,491
And as long as I get you profit,
I think you should be least..

1296
01:31:41,575 --> 01:31:46,075
..bothered whether I put on
a nail paint or lipstick or I dance.

1297
01:31:46,158 --> 01:31:48,825
Right? - Right. Right.

1298
01:32:00,616 --> 01:32:04,491
"There is chaos."

1299
01:32:04,575 --> 01:32:08,491
"There is chaos."

1300
01:32:08,575 --> 01:32:12,241
"We gambled in the game of life."

1301
01:32:12,325 --> 01:32:16,241
"Turned the tables.
And changed the scenario."

1302
01:32:16,575 --> 01:32:20,241
"We got the share of a bit of the world."

1303
01:32:20,450 --> 01:32:24,283
"The world lost to us when we won."

1304
01:32:24,575 --> 01:32:28,366
"It's okay if you do it."

1305
01:32:28,450 --> 01:32:36,200
"But when I did it, it created a storm."

1306
01:32:36,283 --> 01:32:40,408
"It created a storm."

1307
01:32:40,491 --> 01:32:44,283
"It created a storm."

1308
01:32:44,366 --> 01:32:48,658
"It created a storm."

1309
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:52,450
"The shadows of glistening conspiracies."

1310
01:32:52,533 --> 01:32:54,283
"The shadows..

1311
01:32:54,366 --> 01:33:04,658
"These heady nights brought with it
fragrant and intoxicating colors."

1312
01:33:06,241 --> 01:33:09,033
"It created a storm."

1313
01:33:10,533 --> 01:33:12,491
"It created a storm."

1314
01:33:12,575 --> 01:33:16,491
"So many faces. One of them is mine."

1315
01:33:16,575 --> 01:33:20,366
"You get envious when it shines through."

1316
01:33:20,450 --> 01:33:24,325
"Let people talk about me too."

1317
01:33:24,408 --> 01:33:28,366
"The season of desires will not revisit."

1318
01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:32,325
"There's merriment all around."

1319
01:33:32,408 --> 01:33:40,325
"When I tried soaking it all in,
it created a storm."

1320
01:33:40,408 --> 01:33:44,366
It created a storm."

1321
01:33:44,450 --> 01:33:48,366
It created a storm."

1322
01:33:48,450 --> 01:33:52,491
"It created a storm."

1323
01:33:52,575 --> 01:33:55,825
"A storm."

1324
01:33:55,908 --> 01:34:00,408
"A storm."

1325
01:34:00,491 --> 01:34:04,450
"There's merriment all around."

1326
01:34:04,533 --> 01:34:12,325
"When I tried soaking it all in,
it created a storm."

1327
01:34:12,408 --> 01:34:16,241
It created a storm."

1328
01:34:16,325 --> 01:34:20,325
It created a storm."

1329
01:34:20,408 --> 01:34:25,991
It created a storm."

1330
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:32,658
Gul, come here.

1331
01:34:35,575 --> 01:34:38,033
Meet our guests from Japan. Kumatsu

1332
01:34:38,116 --> 01:34:39,366
Hi. - Pleased to meet you. - Hi.

1333
01:34:39,450 --> 01:34:40,783
Mr. Razumi. - Hi.

1334
01:34:40,866 --> 01:34:42,700
And this is Gul.

1335
01:34:43,450 --> 01:34:45,116
Take them to the conference room.

1336
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:46,658
Sure. - Please make yourself comfortable.
- Come.

1337
01:34:46,741 --> 01:34:48,741
I'll just join you in a while. Gentlemen.

1338
01:34:48,825 --> 01:34:50,450
Have you ever been to Japan?

1339
01:34:50,533 --> 01:34:53,908
Japan. I'll be going there very soon
now that I've found you.

1340
01:35:18,450 --> 01:35:20,325
"My Jugni.."

1341
01:35:20,408 --> 01:35:22,241
"My Jugni.."

1342
01:35:22,325 --> 01:35:23,866
"The one who is in love."

1343
01:35:23,950 --> 01:35:26,866
"My Jugni.."

1344
01:35:26,950 --> 01:35:28,866
"My Jugni.."

1345
01:35:28,950 --> 01:35:30,908
"She takes the name of her beloved."

1346
01:35:30,991 --> 01:35:33,116
"She takes the name.. ."

1347
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:35,325
"The name of her beloved."

1348
01:35:35,408 --> 01:35:37,241
"She takes the name of her beloved."

1349
01:35:37,325 --> 01:35:40,408
"Like a prayer."

1350
01:35:43,533 --> 01:35:48,575
"Love is sweeter than honey."

1351
01:35:49,825 --> 01:35:54,783
"Youth is for a short time."

1352
01:35:56,033 --> 01:36:01,325
"Your foundation is nothing."

1353
01:36:02,241 --> 01:36:06,700
"Everything else is of no use."

1354
01:36:06,741 --> 01:36:10,283
"My Jugni.."

1355
01:36:10,366 --> 01:36:12,658
"My Jugni.."

1356
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:14,866
"My Jugni.."

1357
01:36:14,950 --> 01:36:16,991
"She takes the name.. ."

1358
01:36:17,075 --> 01:36:19,116
"The name of her beloved."

1359
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:21,033
"She takes the name of her beloved."

1360
01:36:21,116 --> 01:36:24,366
"Like a prayer."

1361
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:34,366
"Youth is short-lived, lets enjoy it."

1362
01:36:35,741 --> 01:36:40,866
"There is no guarantee of life.'

1363
01:36:42,158 --> 01:36:47,200
"Don't waste time."

1364
01:36:48,283 --> 01:36:52,533
"Once youth is gone.."

1365
01:36:52,616 --> 01:36:56,200
"..it will not return."

1366
01:36:56,283 --> 01:36:58,575
"My Jugni.."

1367
01:36:58,658 --> 01:37:00,741
"My Jugni.."

1368
01:37:00,783 --> 01:37:02,908
"She takes the name.. ."

1369
01:37:02,991 --> 01:37:05,075
"The name of her beloved."

1370
01:37:05,158 --> 01:37:06,950
"She takes the name of her beloved."

1371
01:37:07,033 --> 01:37:09,241
"Like a prayer."

1372
01:37:09,325 --> 01:37:12,741
"My Jugni.."

1373
01:37:13,033 --> 01:37:16,449
"My Jugni.."
