17
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:29,050
Young people, interested in drama,
flock together and start a dramatic society.

18
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:31,901
There they built their family with care,
love, envy and jealousy.

19
00:03:31,902 --> 00:03:33,461
They don't lead a normal family life.

20
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:36,578
This picture has tried to depict a
chapter in the history of such a family.

21
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:52,164
Now the 2nd act of the drama begins.

22
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,763
Why should I go?...

23
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,668
Tell me...

24
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:03,436
leaving my fertile land - the Padma river...

25
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:05,602
why should I go?

26
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,947
For food...

27
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,848
this is the last chance to be a refugee...

28
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:13,549
Refugee...

29
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,779
Landless refugee... named by media
persons.

30
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,282
Oh! Shame... shame.

31
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,284
See that old fool...

32
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,530
doesn't listen to anything...
anything useful.

33
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,833
Father, isn't Calcutta a big city?

34
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:36,775
Rubbish.

35
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:40,611
Bad luck...

36
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:46,010
I am unlucky... even my forefathers are
unlucky...

37
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,481
why I was unlucky to be born beside the
Padma...

38
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,327
I am leaving my own mother...

39
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:15,742
here I performed the last rites of my own
mother.

40
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:17,480
That too was long before...

41
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,415
Ha! Drama...

42
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,181
Do you know the name Shanta?...

43
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:26,725
Experiment.

44
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,952
Research work of Jagdish Chandra Bose.

45
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,792
Our Anusua will canter...

46
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,255
we will win the competition.

47
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,693
Why Anusua?

48
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,194
She is best among you...

49
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,633
Ramen has not yet come from backstage.

50
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,838
There is shortage of people
in the crowd scene?

51
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:47,803
Pulling on anybody on the stage...

52
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,779
Ramen must be enjoying himself.

53
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,476
Ramen, why are you in such hurry?

54
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:02,491
Ramen, why are you in such hurry?

55
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,386
Don't joke... Anusua is acting.

56
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,124
What?...

57
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,789
There is a 10 minute intermission...

58
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,954
Afterward the last act of the drama will be
played.

59
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,828
From that point you will walk back here...

60
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,000
you have reached Calcutta only today...

61
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,866
your husband has taken the youngest son in
search of water...

62
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:50,037
not yet coming back...

63
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,742
you are gradually becoming desperate...

64
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,144
you have no dialogue...

65
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:56,415
alright...

66
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,634
You should have seen Ramen's face...

67
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,094
as I was calling this lady...

68
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:19,636
he was getting fused.

69
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:42,728
Take it...

70
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:46,693
pull the saree over your head.

71
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:22,893
What were you thinking?

72
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:26,805
About the role...

73
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:28,173
Goodness...

74
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,532
don't think... won't she make a mess of it?

75
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:32,344
Shut up.

76
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,006
Oh! Mahindar...

77
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,007
this the West Bank...

78
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:39,511
your land of promise...

79
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:44,169
sitting under the platform with

80
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:48,687
mosquitoes buzzing and a dreamy sky...

81
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,756
where do I look...

82
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:56,622
foggy every where...

83
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,397
landless refugees...

84
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:04,394
The oldie is always bickering...

85
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,817
Pulling the saree over head...

86
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,085
extreme...

87
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,778
you can put rightly...

88
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,800
Wait...

89
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:37,626
where are you insulting?

90
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,167
You have insulted every one... being the
Secretary.

91
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:42,307
Oh!...

92
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,704
as I acted with them!...

93
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:45,907
They are our rivals...

94
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,112
Why?...

95
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,244
Because we all think like that...

96
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:00,719
But the act...

97
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,927
how everybody reacted...

98
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:04,728
We want this...

99
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,354
will act for this...

100
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:10,797
rival.

101
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,304
Our meeting will start tomorrow morning.

102
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,744
Drama is the reflection of society...

103
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,083
we are inspiring our country...

104
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,130
What does all this mean?

105
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,071
Let him say...

106
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,309
Why is 'Dakshina Path' absolutely rubbish?

107
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:02,287
What?...

108
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,686
Yesterday this gentleman was saying...

109
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,922
since it was not good...
don't disturb us.

110
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,768
I expected a bit more courtesy
from you...

111
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,159
Let's go out...

112
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,987
Don't leave before I finish...

113
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,270
You carry on, we are here...

114
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:07,714
Talk...

115
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,809
why are you not saying anything?

116
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,456
Jaya, who is this lady?

117
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:16,151
Anasua Bhattacharya from Dakshina Path.

118
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,502
Come, like to have tea...

119
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:24,369
No...

120
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,595
but why are you not saying?...

121
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,139
Tell me why did you say that?

122
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,437
That was uttered in anger?

123
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:35,447
Why?...

124
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,939
you're a relation of Shanta?

125
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:40,485
Yes, my aunt...

126
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,383
You are new here?...

127
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:46,587
She was with us...

128
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,754
suddenly before a show... she broke away
and created her own group...

129
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,763
why did they do so?

130
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:10,507
I took it as a personal insult...

131
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,049
I saw your drama...

132
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,323
may I say something?

133
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:21,293
Ya...

134
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,793
Why do you shout so much?...

135
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:25,886
It is as if you fighting...

136
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,569
Anything else...

137
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,400
Ma'am... I find you intelligent...

138
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,040
why don't you join our group?

139
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,201
Bhrigu will make an actress of you.

140
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,346
You are very sure about yourself...

141
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:46,351
Anasua come...

142
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:58,229
Feeling sad...

143
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,934
Talk with a girl for so long without being
excited...

144
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:04,135
that's something new...

145
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,370
Bogus!...

146
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:06,504
Hello! Sir...

147
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,301
I loved your drama...

148
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,411
I'm a refugee too...

149
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,546
I was attached to the theatre...

150
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,949
so I still get excited.

151
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,088
You are an actor?
- Yes...

152
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,643
I used to write and couldn't forget drama...

153
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,208
would you take me in your group?

154
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:50,543
On that side...
- Hey...

155
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,741
I'm sending this person...
test his ability.

156
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:13,538
See the still photos...

157
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,590
Anasua, you talked about staging a show

158
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:25,106
with actors from both groups...
everybody is quite interested...

159
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:26,313
we can do it.

160
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:31,556
Let's see...

161
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:39,728
The house is just behind yours...

162
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:40,598
What?...

163
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,396
If you keep your eyes open...
you'll find her often...

164
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:47,865
I'll give you an enlarged copy
of this.

165
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:04,122
Brother...

166
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:12,129
This could be your mother's diary but
unfortunately she was my mother too...

167
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,565
so I have the right to touch it...

168
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,162
writing a letter to a foreign land?

169
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:19,337
Not at all...

170
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:23,641
listen...

171
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,300
I got an opportunity for staging
a drama...

172
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:29,842
I would like to utilize it.

173
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,011
Disgusting...

174
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:12,457
Whom do you want?

175
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,433
Hello! Sir... I have come...

176
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,004
This is Arjuna...

177
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:30,837
we will try to show what he would have done
if you were in this room at this moment.

178
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,031
Better to have music here...

179
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,734
Something like a Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar.

180
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,521
Play fervently...

181
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:33,704
A letter here...

182
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:38,609
What is in this...

183
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:40,606
A proposal to stage a drama with
both groups combined together...

184
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,817
you will produce and your opinion about
rehearsal etc will be obeyed...

185
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,118
and the expenses will be shared equally...

186
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,922
if you consent, it can be started quickly.

187
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,323
Anusua, what you say is very good...

188
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:56,228
What do you say?

189
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:58,463
Of course...

190
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,232
We will let you know after consultation.

191
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,038
The enlarged photograph you asked for...

192
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,199
here is the photograph for you.

193
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:14,279
Nice...

194
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,576
Ok, bye then.

195
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:22,077
Bhrigu, go home and work with the script.
I wonder...

196
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,618
Why are you interested in this particular
photograph?

197
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,907
I couldn't forget your dialogue
of that day...

198
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:46,978
What?...

199
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,176
The sky is dreamy...

200
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,342
it's foggy...

201
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,420
I take your leave.

202
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,424
I shouldn't have started a drama
like this...

203
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,698
it started from the conference day.

204
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:22,680
Father, I want to see the trees
and the creepers...

205
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:26,449
I know, my daughter...
they are really dear to your heart...

206
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,041
Shakuntala...

207
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:58,891
as the creepers have found their rest

208
00:21:58,892 --> 00:22:01,814
in the strong arms of the tree...

209
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:07,617
similarly you're going
to your in-laws' place

210
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:10,759
to find your home and shelter...

211
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,293
from today I feel assured... this way,
my daughter.

212
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,410
Nothing...

213
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:31,640
There's a dialogue of Priyambada next...

214
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:33,850
Why he is not saying it?

215
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:34,785
She is outside...

216
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:42,054
Loitering outsie?
Didn't think to ask permission...

217
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:43,361
Start.

218
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,339
Wasting our time like this...

219
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:58,032
The weak should be taught separately.

220
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,370
Prepare everyone individually.

221
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,649
But when you have taken the
responsibility...

222
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,346
Don't come here without memorizing the
dialogue...

223
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,222
Should you feel so, you can come
to my place tomorrow morning...

224
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:28,101
If you hear him talking,
you feel how grown up he is...

225
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,340
but really he is a child...

226
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,272
it has become his habit

227
00:23:35,273 --> 00:23:38,572
by playing with words...

228
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:57,264
now he is up...

229
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,499
please take it to him...

230
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:17,784
How untidy...

231
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:18,923
Not untidy...

232
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,657
I kept whatever references I have
gotten about Shakuntala...

233
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:26,297
where is the script?

234
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,256
In the drawing room...
I gave it to Parvat.

235
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:37,705
Sister, send a cup of tea
to the drawing room.

236
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,609
An unknown bird is chirping...

237
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:22,986
this is Calcutta... bricks, woods, smoke
but a bird sings there...

238
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:24,388
Leave that aside...

239
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:25,656
Start...

240
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:31,591
You are so rough...

241
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,487
you won't have any friends
in your life.

242
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:35,195
Oh!

243
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:38,669
Yeah...

244
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,003
There is much about stage acting...

245
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:48,541
you've got to learn
about walking on stage...

246
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:51,813
the whole lot...

247
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:54,313
please start...

248
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:15,105
You will never get a wife... you fool...

249
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,569
She only came here to learn about acting...

250
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,613
what enthusiasm.

251
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:25,573
I didn't understand that you
would react like this...

252
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,122
I got the contract from Lolgola.

253
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:39,987
I heard... Jaya is locked in her house
they wouldn't allow her out...

254
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:41,732
she's even been beaten.

255
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:44,766
Why?

256
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:47,869
Orthodox family... couldn't allow girls in
theatre...

257
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:53,377
she comes out somehow and tries to
manage with her smile.

258
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:56,340
How do we manage this problem...

259
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:01,686
Is the role a big one...

260
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:03,012
Not at all...

261
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:04,253
you can pick it up...

262
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:11,259
Take Anasua to rehearsal.

263
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:20,694
Bhrigu, listen we have a house
in Kurseong...

264
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,473
we can go there for rehearsal...

265
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,211
we can have an uninterrupted rehearsal
and a good outing too...

266
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,416
if you say so, I can arrange it.

267
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:36,519
You may... you can rehearse
quite luxuriously...

268
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:38,718
Open the door

269
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:42,283
Let the darkness be removed

270
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:52,425
Come the creator, come the artists

271
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:03,037
Break the shackles of darkness

272
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,735
Why do you follow after Shanta!

273
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:31,166
They eat well...

274
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:32,870
Don't... they are not good.

275
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,320
Come see...

276
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,952
please come...

277
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:54,328
Where are you going?

278
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:58,095
To the Padma...

279
00:28:58,536 --> 00:28:59,798
got the instrument?

280
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:00,671
Ya...

281
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:16,427
Oh! Padma, once I left you

282
00:29:16,428 --> 00:29:19,922
I came back again

283
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,124
Hey ho...

284
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:38,665
I start for home

285
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:45,706
in this boat

286
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:04,633
Bowing to mother Padma...

287
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,101
Padma, this side and that side...

288
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:10,100
we are sitting in the middle...

289
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,510
Start.

290
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:22,375
Padma this side

291
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,578
Padma that side

292
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:37,224
In the middle the sand head of Jagina

293
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:46,900
Shiva is sitting there

294
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:40,753
The other side is East Bengal...

295
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:50,740
I didn't realize my birthplace
is so near...

296
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,075
the sky is not foggy here...

297
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,113
I'm feeling sad...

298
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:54,629
The world is peaceful...

299
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:03,378
We will never get it back...

300
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,418
I feel we are outsiders...

301
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:13,588
don't you feel so?

302
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:27,332
When I think about home...

303
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:29,699
I remember about water and wooden
bridges...

304
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:33,877
mother used to take us to worship the sun...

305
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:37,944
we used to walk a long...

306
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,377
Let's walk!

307
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:43,383
Ok

308
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,047
Listen... on the other side is my home...

309
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,394
I can see those houses there...

310
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,769
I will never be able to go there...

311
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:42,863
When you were talking about your home

312
00:34:42,864 --> 00:34:45,907
I was trying to find my house...

313
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:53,548
the rail track on which we were standing...

314
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:59,084
I used to get down here
coming from Calcutta

315
00:34:59,085 --> 00:35:02,966
and mother would be waiting there...

316
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:12,318
I was thinking the rail
track was a reunion point

317
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:15,608
now it has become a place of division.

318
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,478
Oh! What happened to our Bengal?

319
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:28,553
That day you defined me as very rough...

320
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:31,119
but I was not like that before...

321
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:36,833
sitting on the other side of the Padma
I enjoyed so many things...

322
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:40,128
the array of colours on the clouds,
the setting sun, the cool breeze...

323
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:46,310
but we became paupers all of a sudden...

324
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:54,674
father died like a beggar...

325
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:01,318
and mother died almost of hunger.

326
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:07,994
Just before he died, father said
how beautifully life had started...

327
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:11,231
should one die like this.

328
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:17,104
You don't know how lonely I have become.

329
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:20,103
Me too...

330
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,343
I am also very alone... very tired.

331
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:26,516
What happened...

332
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:29,549
Anasua... Anasua.

333
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,587
I am really tired...

334
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,940
Nothing...

335
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:05,554
please don't mind...

336
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:19,937
Oh!

337
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:21,434
What happened!

338
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:49,223
I have seen everything...

339
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:50,826
what you did, you traitor...

340
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:51,825
It just happened...

341
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,425
what do I do now?

342
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:01,730
Bhrigu, I accompanied Anasua...

343
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:02,869
when is the rehearsal tomorrow?

344
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,140
At 6 o'clock.

345
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,772
But I must thank you!

346
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:08,678
Why?...

347
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:13,044
She was so depressed before she met you...

348
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,682
her husband went to the continent.

349
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:15,986
Husband?
- Ya...

350
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,084
we called it jokingly...

351
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:20,287
Anasua got a letter just today...

352
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:22,389
that man will return after a month or so...

353
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:24,322
then it will no longer remain a joke.

354
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:31,697
Bhrigu, come... see...
there's a big accident...

355
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:32,669
Where is Bhrigu?

356
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:37,569
He has gone...

357
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:48,304
You're not feeling well...
show your tongue...

358
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,980
What do I do...

359
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:54,573
Your brother gave this task
before going to the office...

360
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:00,123
Come...

361
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:00,957
Sit here...

362
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:12,732
You didn't go to rehearsal
for two days...

363
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:14,463
no information too...

364
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:19,072
meanwhile Shanta aunty has arranged
the house in Kurseang...

365
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,769
they want to go

366
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,178
...I thought you are unwell...

367
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:31,643
couldn't come...

368
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:38,918
I had to write a long letter
in reply of an urgent one...

369
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,091
I have something to tell you.

370
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:48,405
Why?

371
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:54,009
Not in the house...

372
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:00,584
Let's go...

373
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:46,629
I help him write drama.

374
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:50,762
I have finished two acts
and couldn't arrange the finishing.

375
00:43:27,763 --> 00:43:29,058
A painful situation is arising...

376
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:29,939
What...

377
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:34,502
Shanta aunty... is saying
a lot of odd things about you...

378
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:41,942
said that you are fooling with me...

379
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:51,683
won't you say anything?...

380
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:52,896
What do I say?

381
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:59,227
That's why the boys are loitering outside...

382
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,734
That day you were hurt very much...

383
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:05,173
Have you heard?

384
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,009
You are really a gem.

385
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:11,276
Let it go...

386
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,480
I heard we are going to Kurseang...

387
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:15,151
when?

388
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,419
How do I say it?...

389
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:19,180
Bhrigu is not coming to rehearsal
for the last few days...

390
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,887
I will force him to come...

391
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:24,355
Since he has learned Rishi is singing

392
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,797
"The sky is full of stars and the sun
and the earth are full of life"...

393
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:30,497
he says the hills remind him
of this song only.

394
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:41,236
A very favourite song of my mother.

395
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:53,146
The sky is full of stars
and the sun

396
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:58,689
and the earth are full of life

397
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:04,424
Among these I have my place

398
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:19,138
so song flows out of me in wonder

399
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:27,213
In the rhythm of infinity

400
00:45:27,214 --> 00:45:33,214
the universe sways and I feel it with me

401
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:27,106
I have stepped on the grass while traversing

402
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:35,548
The scent of flowers has charmed
and amazed me

403
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:59,005
The song of joy is surrounding

404
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:07,484
and my soul awakens at this wonder

405
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:13,964
I kept my eyes and ears open
for enjoying to the fullest

406
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:35,777
and in the search of the unknown

407
00:47:35,778 --> 00:47:38,317
among known things

408
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,570
Ah... it made the song stale singing
repeatedly...

409
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:34,867
My mother too used to be swayed
at this wonder...

410
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:48,921
Let's go to the garden...

411
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,156
Where is your mother?...

412
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:34,035
She is no more...

413
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:36,599
she went to Noakhali during the riots...

414
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:39,369
when Gandhiji went there...

415
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:50,048
she was so much to me...

416
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:57,257
she was like a flame, Jaya

417
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,926
if you could have seen her burning eyes...

418
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:04,958
I've never seen any eyes
like hers...

419
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:10,139
occasionally...

420
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:12,775
Occasionally?...

421
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,875
I have got a glimpse of it
in Bhrigu's eyes...

422
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:22,149
Bhrigu... Bhrigu...

423
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:29,956
I couldn't understand that boy...

424
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:43,997
She was looking at me...

425
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,338
but turned her face as soon
as I looked...

426
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:49,269
what does it mean...

427
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:50,208
Listen I am...

428
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,017
Bhrigu... Look at the plain
land of Bengal...

429
00:50:55,852 --> 00:51:00,118
as the cloud parts it looks like

430
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:04,783
a small green girl smiling sweetly.

431
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:10,198
I'm getting bored with luxury...

432
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:13,295
the production is now ready...
let's go back.

433
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:16,806
Come...

434
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:18,696
without dust and smoke...

435
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:19,773
is like a fish out of water...

436
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:22,805
eh... wait...

437
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:25,109
I was looking for you.

438
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,748
The girl is a flirt... avoid her.

439
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:26,209
What a rain...

440
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:28,870
I like to get drenched...

441
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:30,107
Start your work

442
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:46,818
Occasionally these things get one
distracted from work...

443
00:52:57,107 --> 00:53:02,101
I believe without a feeling like this
something beautiful cannot be created...

444
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:06,045
Isn't it?...

445
00:53:32,008 --> 00:53:32,770
Sit aunty...

446
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:37,810
You could have put your feet down...

447
00:53:38,448 --> 00:53:39,148
Why?...

448
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:49,652
I thought not to tell you...

449
00:53:52,095 --> 00:53:54,029
but Anasua's behaviour forced me...

450
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:58,065
the girl will ruin herself...

451
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:00,799
becoming intimate with such a bad person...

452
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:02,036
Even more than you?

453
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,298
Pakhi, stop clowning...

454
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:07,336
it will be a big scandal...

455
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,137
Tell about the intimacy in Kurseong...

456
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:15,983
There are so many stories about the boy...

457
00:54:24,527 --> 00:54:26,324
Anasua will be finished...

458
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:30,699
Done?...

459
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:37,939
You may go now...

460
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:43,144
Ok... we know what to do...

461
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:48,414
whenever she gets a letter from abroad...
she gets so excited...

462
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:52,686
and behaving like this, here...

463
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:55,384
we can also write a letter there.

464
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,267
The mind becomes numb
with apprehension

465
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:05,968
The feet turn to stone in fear

466
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:15,467
we could realize the gurgling sound
of the river in the dark night

467
00:55:30,927 --> 00:55:33,725
On the banks of the river
near Sutanuti

468
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:45,639
the ships of invaders

469
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:47,843
What's up?...

470
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,416
I feel everything is ready...

471
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:58,721
Yes.

472
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:01,183
So the date of the show
is to be fixed then...

473
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:03,423
it will be a big show...

474
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:06,322
Right...

475
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,258
it's got to be a big hit...

476
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:12,635
But money?...

477
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,003
Do not worry...

478
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:17,765
I myself will sell tickets
worth Rs. 2000/...

479
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:22,607
and will arrange ads for the souvenir...

480
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:26,812
We too are here...

481
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,039
Let's start the work...

482
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:35,389
we have to book a quite a few stages...

483
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:38,022
Don't fear, we will book 3 stages...

484
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:40,220
we will manage the initial money from
father...

485
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:46,459
Hey ho

486
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:49,464
We grab the storm

487
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:51,004
worn rudder with our strong hands

488
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:58,213
Hey ho

489
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:45,017
The sound of hammer and chisel rings day
and night

490
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:37,179
You are here?...

491
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:40,115
Where do I go?...

492
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:41,049
On the road?...

493
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:43,218
I don't mean that...

494
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:45,177
where are the others?...

495
00:58:47,757 --> 00:58:48,781
On the street...

496
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:52,388
Today is the final rehearsal...

497
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:57,657
they're roaming the streets
throughout all day...

498
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:00,703
So what...

499
00:59:00,706 --> 00:59:02,836
To be an artist doesn't mean
tender people...

500
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:04,640
it is their duty.

501
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:06,135
Why do you get angry?

502
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:11,104
I'm really quite apprehensive
about this drama.

503
00:59:16,419 --> 00:59:17,351
Me too...

504
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:20,649
particularly about the Shakuntala drama.

505
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:22,688
What is the problem?

506
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:24,811
No... the scene where the
deer is pulling the saree

507
00:59:24,812 --> 00:59:25,756
to prevent her from going...

508
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,526
use emotions...

509
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:37,806
go back to 1947...

510
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:40,242
think you are leaving your home...

511
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:41,436
emotion will automatically come...

512
00:59:44,113 --> 00:59:45,444
even in Calcutta...

513
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:47,619
look at the processions...
you will find your friendly

514
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:48,847
creeper-like Naba
Mallika and Banajyotsna...

515
00:59:50,286 --> 00:59:54,689
think of a beggar girl asking for money...
that is the deer cub...

516
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:59,005
Think if you had to leave Calcutta...

517
00:59:59,006 --> 01:00:01,986
leave everything that is here...

518
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:07,759
would it not stand as a barrier...
and prevent your going...

519
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:09,202
what happens...

520
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:16,512
Nothing...

521
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:20,215
Bhrigu...

522
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:21,543
This is the work you are doing...

523
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:23,448
get out...

524
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,381
wanted a person for shouting...

525
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:26,486
I knew you would come...

526
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:29,892
Sick?...

527
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:33,028
Not much...

528
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:37,625
Political worker...

529
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:41,068
got in the clutches of...

530
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:54,934
On the left side...

531
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:10,988
Took 1000 Rupees from home...

532
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:12,324
it is all finished.

533
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:17,056
I don't know what to do...

534
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:22,102
Shanta is holding tickets worth Rs. 1400...

535
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,233
Don't press me...

536
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:27,805
Sabotage...

537
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:28,977
What did you say...

538
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:29,706
Definitely,

539
01:02:30,012 --> 01:02:31,775
we don't have money even for a smoke...

540
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:32,812
Fraud...

541
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:33,749
Ha!

542
01:02:35,451 --> 01:02:36,351
Rishi don't quarrel.

543
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:45,820
Shanta informed everybody to start makeup
from 7 o'clock in the morning...

544
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:03,713
Do I take some money on loan,
my landlord may arrange...

545
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:06,515
Sure...

546
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:10,878
We need 700 to 800 rupees...
the press will come...

547
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:15,518
Unless we take Bhrigu... He won't listen.

548
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:27,393
I can't stand Rishi at all...

549
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:30,262
Will realize tomorrow...

550
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:48,349
Sell those bangles...

551
01:03:50,393 --> 01:03:51,621
see it does not reach Bhrigu's ear...

552
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:53,852
brother please don't object.

553
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:05,707
Where are you going...

554
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:13,740
don't even reply...

555
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:19,920
Why are you not saying?

556
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:22,649
I do not know...

557
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:31,033
Bhrigu, I am leaving...

558
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:32,668
now you go settle...

559
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:39,604
Bhrigu, you come inside...

560
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:43,272
I won't be able to manage...

561
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:44,709
I can go...

562
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:55,614
Ha... you... they are really big people...
aristocrats...

563
01:05:11,374 --> 01:05:15,208
pay the interest timely.

564
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:24,542
You should count yourself fortunate
that I have come...

565
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:25,780
give me the money...

566
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:31,593
give me the paper...

567
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,128
put your fingerprint...

568
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:47,475
Please sign...

569
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:49,576
Sign here...

570
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:27,712
I want only interest...

571
01:06:54,377 --> 01:06:57,141
Bhrigu, it's about time...

572
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:16,763
Shanta hasn't come yet...

573
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:17,766
Just came...

574
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,226
gave only 40 Rupees...

575
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:20,694
failed us flat...

576
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:26,241
Come...

577
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:27,640
It's now 10:15...

578
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:33,179
I couldn't come earlier...
a lot of guests in the house

579
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:40,182
getting ready will take about 15 minutes...

580
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:43,750
I want you to be ready by 10:20...

581
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:45,986
It's not that easy...

582
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:48,257
it will take time...

583
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:18,583
Bhrigu... it is over an hour...
many people are leaving...

584
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,262
Let's not be afraid...

585
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:32,601
I am losing my mood...

586
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:55,419
I just told Shakuntala...

587
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:57,828
and you are asking...

588
01:08:58,367 --> 01:09:02,827
Really... your song made me forget about
the time like king Dushyanta...

589
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:09,372
as he forgot everything
by chasing the deer...

590
01:09:12,515 --> 01:09:13,243
here comes the king...

591
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:48,573
Oh! King... this the abode of Sages...

592
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:52,479
No killing is permitted here...

593
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:16,208
Dear Anasua, it's rather tight...
loosen it slightly...

594
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:18,505
The fault of your youth...

595
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:47,015
Oh! Trees who never used to drink

596
01:10:47,016 --> 01:10:49,977
before watering you...

597
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:58,081
who loved to dress up but would never
pluck a leaf of you...

598
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:05,024
whose joy knew no bounds when you are
about to bloom...

599
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:12,931
that Shankuntala is going to her husband's
place...

600
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,828
give your consent...

601
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:59,341
they gave your consent through
the beautiful songs of the Cuckoos...

602
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:34,473
Why is all this happening...

603
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:36,311
the voice is totally a failure...

604
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:38,911
Shanta is creating chaos downstage...

605
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:40,951
people are laughing at our emotional
scenes...

606
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,184
Where have you been?
The cuckoo's song didn't come...

607
01:12:43,592 --> 01:12:45,116
been out for a cup of tea...

608
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:46,022
...went for tea?...

609
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:51,658
Saw... people making fun of us...

610
01:12:57,406 --> 01:13:00,603
Shanta, why you are destroying such a
beautiful drama...

611
01:13:00,943 --> 01:13:01,643
Me?...

612
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:04,179
Move aside...

613
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:13,077
What has happened to us has happened...
we are destroyed...

614
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:14,088
but blood will flow.

615
01:13:14,156 --> 01:13:16,181
Everything is ready... we can start.

616
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:25,522
A day will come...

617
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:31,796
when this boy will take charge of entire
Bharat...

618
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:36,642
So this boy will be named Bharat...

619
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:43,676
and according to him the Jambu Island will
be named as 'Bharatvarsa'...

620
01:13:46,455 --> 01:13:50,789
King, what greater gift can I give to you.

621
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,027
I don't want anything else...

622
01:13:57,733 --> 01:14:03,733
but pray that people live in peace here...

623
01:14:04,506 --> 01:14:07,339
the learned get their due respects...

624
01:14:57,926 --> 01:15:02,920
A new star of group theatre...

625
01:15:37,432 --> 01:15:39,457
End of joint production...

626
01:16:39,494 --> 01:16:44,001
There come the first rays

627
01:16:44,002 --> 01:16:46,525
of the morning

628
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:12,224
Even then we will have to go far
though the path be difficult

629
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:25,997
Breaking the shackles we will move
far far away

630
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:33,380
Give me a cigarette...

631
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:34,615
Only one is left...

632
01:17:53,602 --> 01:17:56,435
Have you seen what the papers have
written...

633
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:00,841
do we have to bear all this...

634
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:16,887
The lender is pressing everyday...

635
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:22,061
he will beat me
if he finds me...

636
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:24,493
How do I face my father...

637
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:26,395
it's a matter of 1000 rupees...

638
01:18:26,802 --> 01:18:27,996
and 3 months rent is due here...

639
01:18:31,073 --> 01:18:33,667
why did Bhrigu play such a joke...

640
01:18:34,509 --> 01:18:38,172
he promised to pay the entire amount...
but I could not find him now...

641
01:18:39,147 --> 01:18:39,847
well...

642
01:18:40,148 --> 01:18:42,514
now give me the money and get away...

643
01:18:42,684 --> 01:18:44,311
I will give you...

644
01:18:45,987 --> 01:18:49,582
Bhrigu... some of my friends came from
Birbhum...

645
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:53,694
there has been a flood...
we want to make a charity show...

646
01:18:54,496 --> 01:18:56,361
we will be able to give around 300.

647
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:00,459
Grab it... we are ready...

648
01:19:00,702 --> 01:19:01,532
But we require two ladies...

649
01:19:03,004 --> 01:19:04,096
We can approach Anasua...

650
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:05,238
But she is from the other side...

651
01:19:14,549 --> 01:19:15,548
Give me the cigarette...

652
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:16,707
It is not half as yet...

653
01:19:30,365 --> 01:19:31,764
I am telling not...

654
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:11,873
Listen...

655
01:20:12,908 --> 01:20:15,900
you are Bhrigu?
Please come outside...

656
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:30,457
I am Pakhi... elder brother of Anasua...

657
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:33,550
She has come... there she is...

658
01:20:36,131 --> 01:20:36,893
please go...

659
01:20:52,914 --> 01:20:57,908
I have left them... would you take me?

660
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:07,585
From now I can always be with you...

661
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:23,471
Killed my son?...

662
01:21:33,622 --> 01:21:36,022
Doesn't your blood gets heated...

663
01:21:36,324 --> 01:21:39,851
killed her son with their feet...

664
01:21:46,368 --> 01:21:49,064
you young are sitting idle... will die...

665
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:55,342
but not lose our prestige...

666
01:21:55,877 --> 01:21:57,777
must take revenge...

667
01:21:58,680 --> 01:21:59,380
come...

668
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:06,885
die but for a good cause...

669
01:22:34,049 --> 01:22:37,280
My light will get extinguished...

670
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:14,321
Going to bathe...

671
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:18,224
Arrange tomorrow's requisitions properly...

672
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:29,070
Dear...

673
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:31,604
my son died similarly...

674
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:35,908
during the famine they crushed
and killed him...

675
01:23:36,778 --> 01:23:38,006
he used to sing well...

676
01:23:41,049 --> 01:23:42,380
he got a medal...

677
01:23:48,957 --> 01:23:49,685
you are giving it to me...

678
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:53,625
What else can I give... you play this drama
in various places...

679
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:55,992
let people know about Natu my son...

680
01:23:58,633 --> 01:24:02,797
I maintain myself by dint of hard labour...

681
01:24:04,305 --> 01:24:06,170
this is my son's last memento...

682
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:08,573
I am handing over to you...

683
01:24:09,677 --> 01:24:10,473
don't forget...

684
01:24:18,019 --> 01:24:19,281
My mother also was old...

685
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:27,691
died almost starving...

686
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:35,793
What are you doing?...

687
01:25:19,714 --> 01:25:20,442
Finish the job...

688
01:25:48,776 --> 01:25:50,869
Brother... I will go for a walk...

689
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:56,650
But not very far...

690
01:25:59,554 --> 01:26:01,112
Come... Bhrigu has agreed...

691
01:26:02,357 --> 01:26:03,619
you too come along with us...

692
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:05,192
Ok...

693
01:26:21,376 --> 01:26:22,570
come quick...

694
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:36,991
How beautiful...

695
01:26:39,627 --> 01:26:40,753
not emotional al all...

696
01:26:44,299 --> 01:26:49,293
Where do I get time... kept busy by work...

697
01:26:53,908 --> 01:26:55,239
didn't Anasua come?

698
01:26:55,443 --> 01:26:58,537
She is writing a long letter... busy...

699
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:01,944
why are you so unmindful today...

700
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:06,612
Ok... I am coming...

701
01:27:15,496 --> 01:27:18,090
Today in this moonlight night

702
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:23,227
Everybody has come out in the garden

703
01:27:30,645 --> 01:27:35,639
Intoxicating spring wind

704
01:27:45,526 --> 01:27:50,520
I will not go out

705
01:27:55,470 --> 01:28:00,464
will remain alone in my lonely house

706
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:28,025
but will not step out in the engulfing wind

707
01:28:41,883 --> 01:28:46,953
I will have to keep the house

708
01:28:46,954 --> 01:28:50,450
clean with much care

709
01:29:11,779 --> 01:29:15,044
will have to arouse myself

710
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:18,516
Anasua is definitely is waiting
for someone...

711
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:21,344
he will likely come...

712
01:29:29,731 --> 01:29:31,323
I do not know when he will come.

713
01:29:35,136 --> 01:29:36,135
Have something to say...

714
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:42,933
if he remembers me

715
01:29:43,644 --> 01:29:44,542
please sit... listen...

716
01:29:45,446 --> 01:29:50,440
in this intoxicating spring wind.

717
01:30:17,712 --> 01:30:19,077
Brother, please get up...

718
01:30:19,747 --> 01:30:20,611
Anasua is calling you...

719
01:30:21,349 --> 01:30:22,281
there she is...

720
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:30,124
Brother...

721
01:30:31,225 --> 01:30:32,624
Something happened yesterday...

722
01:30:33,394 --> 01:30:34,094
What?...

723
01:30:34,362 --> 01:30:35,361
...I'm feeling ashamed...

724
01:30:40,034 --> 01:30:43,765
Shibu was telling me something...

725
01:30:48,776 --> 01:30:49,476
Eh!...

726
01:30:51,979 --> 01:30:52,741
He wanted to marry?...

727
01:30:53,781 --> 01:30:56,215
Oh, no! You always talk bluntly...

728
01:30:56,317 --> 01:30:57,316
What did you say?

729
01:30:58,419 --> 01:31:00,819
I ran away... feel saddened...

730
01:31:01,889 --> 01:31:04,551
I don't know what possessed him...

731
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:10,453
Is there anybody else in your mind...

732
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:13,157
Speak truly or I will give you
a good thrashing...

733
01:31:13,901 --> 01:31:15,334
Yes.

734
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:22,860
I've something important to tell you...

735
01:32:26,607 --> 01:32:27,307
let's walk...

736
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:33,247
Come...

737
01:32:33,748 --> 01:32:34,976
Today... I will tell you everything...

738
01:32:42,857 --> 01:32:47,158
my mother was always in search
of something from boys

739
01:32:47,159 --> 01:32:49,786
even from the revolutionary days...

740
01:33:01,609 --> 01:33:03,543
she tried to bring me up like herself...

741
01:33:14,857 --> 01:33:18,923
mother used to say our country is repeatedly
invaded by barbaric demons...

742
01:33:20,227 --> 01:33:21,592
we will have to create fighters...

743
01:33:22,563 --> 01:33:24,258
and only women can do it...

744
01:33:32,406 --> 01:33:33,498
you are one such boy...

745
01:33:35,009 --> 01:33:36,135
I recognized it as soon as I saw you...

746
01:33:42,249 --> 01:33:43,045
take my mother's diary...

747
01:33:46,387 --> 01:33:48,218
a great source of inspiration
of my life...

748
01:33:49,890 --> 01:33:53,223
every page of this depicts
my mother's wishes...

749
01:33:54,362 --> 01:33:55,920
you will understand...

750
01:33:58,799 --> 01:34:04,704
Brother says that I look at this diary as a
symbol of my mother...

751
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:07,805
but that cannot be...

752
01:34:18,019 --> 01:34:18,781
keep it with care...

753
01:34:22,023 --> 01:34:22,853
what is that?

754
01:34:28,095 --> 01:34:29,221
...I will tell you...

755
01:34:30,197 --> 01:34:32,631
I call her in my mind
a soft musical score...

756
01:34:34,635 --> 01:34:36,000
a line from Rabindra Nath's poem...

757
01:34:36,804 --> 01:34:37,532
she maintains a soft
melancholy presence...

758
01:34:43,077 --> 01:34:45,929
Just like our Bengal...

759
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:49,277
she is also a sweet girl...

760
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:50,550
Yes...

761
01:34:51,118 --> 01:34:52,585
oh! There are so many attachments...

762
01:34:54,488 --> 01:34:55,682
Let's go a bit farther...

763
01:34:57,358 --> 01:34:58,154
come...

764
01:35:02,997 --> 01:35:06,489
During the riots... returning by steamer,
after losing mother...

765
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:12,935
I got acquainted with a person coming
to Calcutta on his way to France...

766
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:20,044
his name is Samar...

767
01:35:21,582 --> 01:35:26,576
I used to call him Fardinnan
as he named me Miranda...

768
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:29,920
childish...

769
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:33,854
an acquaintance of only 3 days...

770
01:35:35,529 --> 01:35:38,862
how calm and quiet,
just the opposite of you...

771
01:35:47,575 --> 01:35:51,204
I accepted him by letter.

772
01:35:52,613 --> 01:35:56,420
The course was 4 years
but later he informed me

773
01:35:56,421 --> 01:36:00,782
he would have to stay 2 more
years for higher studies...

774
01:36:02,623 --> 01:36:03,851
I objected...

775
01:36:04,859 --> 01:36:05,759
he became angry...

776
01:36:08,162 --> 01:36:08,862
I acceded...

777
01:36:16,971 --> 01:36:20,736
but I got a letter only
the day before yesterday

778
01:36:20,737 --> 01:36:26,175
that he will have to stay another
5 years for practical training...

779
01:36:28,516 --> 01:36:30,211
tell me what a disaster it is for me...

780
01:36:33,087 --> 01:36:34,384
even both families are against this
marriage...

781
01:36:35,856 --> 01:36:36,788
different castes...

782
01:36:39,627 --> 01:36:43,188
doesn't he realize that a girl is waiting
for 6 long years...

783
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:45,231
another 5 years?

784
01:36:45,733 --> 01:36:47,496
Couldn't he come even for a single day...

785
01:36:58,245 --> 01:37:01,840
I wrote a letter last night...

786
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:07,549
I do not know if the decision
is right or wrong...

787
01:37:13,294 --> 01:37:14,420
please go through it.

788
01:37:20,067 --> 01:37:22,831
Not now... sometime later...

789
01:38:10,517 --> 01:38:16,517
The only words that are hammering me are

790
01:38:16,889 --> 01:38:22,889
'Let all the brothers and
sisters of Bengal come together'.

791
01:38:47,288 --> 01:38:50,382
How divided is Bengal
even then full of fun...

792
01:38:51,492 --> 01:38:52,192
write...

793
01:38:52,626 --> 01:38:53,526
write those words...

794
01:38:56,897 --> 01:39:00,060
But a line like this from the lips of such a
character... would it be right?...

795
01:39:00,367 --> 01:39:01,067
Oh!

796
01:39:10,477 --> 01:39:12,240
Definitely it will suit...

797
01:39:13,013 --> 01:39:13,741
do write...

798
01:39:33,534 --> 01:39:34,592
How do you feel now?

799
01:39:42,910 --> 01:39:43,706
Better to be working...

800
01:39:54,521 --> 01:39:58,423
Your association moulding me...

801
01:39:58,592 --> 01:39:59,292
Jaya?...

802
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:07,798
Better forget it...

803
01:40:19,246 --> 01:40:19,974
Is there somebody else...

804
01:40:27,254 --> 01:40:27,954
Who?

805
01:40:29,356 --> 01:40:30,256
I don't know...

806
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:36,296
I'd better come after everybody leaves...

807
01:40:41,835 --> 01:40:42,735
would you ask?

808
01:40:43,070 --> 01:40:43,770
Ya...

809
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:50,499
Oh! World you surprise me

810
01:41:05,759 --> 01:41:07,818
As I started checking accounts

811
01:41:13,534 --> 01:41:17,470
I found only blood has been spent freely

812
01:41:22,209 --> 01:41:27,203
Being born here my fate
was only of misery and abuse

813
01:41:34,188 --> 01:41:39,182
Strange world I salute thee

814
01:41:40,561 --> 01:41:45,555
Today there is revolution everywhere

815
01:41:55,909 --> 01:41:56,637
Would you please go out for a moment...

816
01:41:58,846 --> 01:41:59,746
Mr. Gagan you too...

817
01:42:27,207 --> 01:42:28,902
Jaya... who is it...

818
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:41,615
tell me quickly... anyone may turn up...

819
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:56,870
Rishi...

820
01:42:57,204 --> 01:42:57,904
Rishi

821
01:43:11,518 --> 01:43:12,712
Was she beaten again?

822
01:43:14,254 --> 01:43:15,221
Getting beaten all the time...

823
01:43:18,959 --> 01:43:20,551
Pravat, there will be no rehearsal today...

824
01:43:20,894 --> 01:43:22,691
you come tomorrow...
he has left his group...

825
01:43:25,699 --> 01:43:27,826
He handed over the money
to Mahabir for rent due...

826
01:43:42,349 --> 01:43:43,049
Rishi...

827
01:43:51,158 --> 01:43:56,118
The drama the boys of East Bengal are
producing will beat yours hands down...

828
01:44:07,241 --> 01:44:08,041
I am late...

829
01:44:21,855 --> 01:44:24,722
I am charging again there is
no democracy in this group...

830
01:44:25,559 --> 01:44:27,217
Bhrigu handed the money
received from Birbhum

831
01:44:27,218 --> 01:44:28,460
to Mahabir without consulting anyone.

832
01:44:30,063 --> 01:44:31,496
It's not really correct to hand over
the money to Mahabir...

833
01:44:32,899 --> 01:44:34,662
he shouldn't have given it
to such a person...

834
01:44:36,303 --> 01:44:38,828
Mahabir hasn't handed the money to the
lender...

835
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:42,032
I've spent the money on some acute
need in the house...

836
01:44:45,946 --> 01:44:46,776
and Bhrigu was there...

837
01:44:47,447 --> 01:44:48,311
we took the loan together...

838
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:50,650
Bhrigu...

839
01:44:51,918 --> 01:44:52,917
I have got nothing to say...

840
01:44:52,919 --> 01:44:54,216
I object to this very attitude...

841
01:44:55,222 --> 01:44:57,713
if anybody is slightly late
in rehearsal you will raise hell...

842
01:44:57,791 --> 01:44:58,790
but for him only - I am late is sufficient.

843
01:44:59,192 --> 01:45:02,127
...I have something else to say...
please do not mind...

844
01:45:02,529 --> 01:45:05,726
we had a good reputation about the morality
of the group...

845
01:45:06,033 --> 01:45:06,933
now we are losing it...

846
01:45:07,167 --> 01:45:09,397
I want to know the relation between Bhrigu
and Anusua.

847
01:45:09,603 --> 01:45:10,303
Listen...

848
01:45:10,971 --> 01:45:12,996
Please sit... I am not a bad person...

849
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:16,234
I want to know very clearly whether
they are going to marry...

850
01:45:19,446 --> 01:45:20,146
but no...

851
01:45:20,914 --> 01:45:23,007
Anasua is engaged somewhere else...

852
01:45:23,350 --> 01:45:26,703
but let Bhrigu say...
hasn't he told me often

853
01:45:26,704 --> 01:45:29,255
very clearly that he loves Anasua...

854
01:45:29,823 --> 01:45:31,017
does she know about this?...

855
01:45:31,325 --> 01:45:33,452
And even after knowing if she acts like
this... what does it mean?...

856
01:45:33,827 --> 01:45:34,626
Answer me...

857
01:45:56,683 --> 01:45:58,617
this group is one person's monopoly...

858
01:45:59,353 --> 01:46:05,087
big talk is spoken only...
I have no future... I quit...

859
01:46:11,865 --> 01:46:17,865
My brother has written there may be a
chance in Bombay...

860
01:46:18,557 --> 01:46:24,557
if I go I will arrange to
send the money from there.

861
01:46:25,379 --> 01:46:26,471
Mahabir... wait...

862
01:46:29,449 --> 01:46:32,475
Rishi... I have a serious
financial problem...

863
01:46:41,461 --> 01:46:42,460
I can't continue.

864
01:46:46,633 --> 01:46:48,123
Everywhere it is the same dirtiness.

865
01:46:59,012 --> 01:47:00,070
It is no place to whimper...

866
01:47:01,047 --> 01:47:01,747
get lost...

867
01:47:03,717 --> 01:47:04,417
Come...

868
01:47:38,318 --> 01:47:40,684
I have completed the play...

869
01:48:19,759 --> 01:48:21,090
The boy doesn't speak much... likely to be
much substance with this...

870
01:48:32,205 --> 01:48:33,204
Normally it's like this...

871
01:48:33,473 --> 01:48:37,705
the leaders are generally rough and proud...

872
01:48:38,378 --> 01:48:42,576
they are to be respected but
occasionally to be kicked hard too.

873
01:49:28,028 --> 01:49:28,928
I came back...

874
01:49:30,196 --> 01:49:31,195
I couldn't stay away...

875
01:49:37,504 --> 01:49:40,496
I wonder if everyone is right
and I am wrong...

876
01:49:45,011 --> 01:49:46,535
but I still like to think
about him...

877
01:49:51,318 --> 01:49:52,979
do I have attraction for both...

878
01:49:55,121 --> 01:49:56,019
Oh! How very painful...

879
01:50:00,961 --> 01:50:02,826
Forget about this...
it doesn't matter...

880
01:50:10,437 --> 01:50:11,529
Then are you trying to deceive yourself?...

881
01:50:14,074 --> 01:50:17,703
your pain must be more intense...

882
01:50:23,617 --> 01:50:28,384
Why did our lives got entangled
like this...

883
01:50:40,934 --> 01:50:42,959
The play written by Kunal...
is finished...

884
01:50:44,771 --> 01:50:45,770
Have you read it?...

885
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:47,139
How is it?...

886
01:50:47,540 --> 01:50:48,240
Excellent...

887
01:50:49,743 --> 01:50:52,507
Kunal and Gagan are two great finds.

888
01:50:57,550 --> 01:51:01,281
The subject is beautiful...
about the division of Bengal...

889
01:51:02,022 --> 01:51:05,685
...Arranged very nicely from Kshudiram to
Rabindra Nath...

890
01:51:10,030 --> 01:51:14,490
I could visualize the setting...

891
01:51:17,270 --> 01:51:18,794
the movement of the actors...

892
01:51:20,874 --> 01:51:24,537
controlling the speed in an orchestral
pattern...

893
01:51:27,447 --> 01:51:28,446
will present like a harmony...

894
01:51:37,757 --> 01:51:40,658
would my boys be able to perform it...

895
01:51:42,996 --> 01:51:43,696
Certainly...

896
01:51:44,664 --> 01:51:46,222
There is a dynamic movement...

897
01:51:47,667 --> 01:51:49,498
the first time a play is written
like this...

898
01:51:55,108 --> 01:51:56,507
How is the casting of your play...

899
01:51:57,711 --> 01:51:59,906
you're sewing the costumes
for over a month...

900
01:52:00,180 --> 01:52:02,842
Do not disturb me at all... tomorrow is the
show...

901
01:52:03,383 --> 01:52:04,083
Really...

902
01:52:04,517 --> 01:52:07,015
they didn't ask me to sell tickets.

903
01:52:07,016 --> 01:52:13,016
If the play is like Shakuntala, they will
beat me up whomever I lure and sell tickets.

904
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:15,523
Go to the office... don't disturb me...

905
01:52:17,564 --> 01:52:21,364
What office?
Today there is a strike...

906
01:52:23,470 --> 01:52:27,403
Come back early from rehearsal...

907
01:52:27,404 --> 01:52:33,243
trouble may erupt... there
will be processions...

908
01:52:35,081 --> 01:52:36,139
Then how will Rishi go to Budge Budge?

909
01:52:37,016 --> 01:52:37,816
Budge Budge...

910
01:52:38,918 --> 01:52:40,078
The Pandal will be erected there...

911
01:52:40,854 --> 01:52:41,754
a big show...

912
01:52:42,055 --> 01:52:43,249
our first show...

913
01:52:44,157 --> 01:52:45,089
thousands of people will come...

914
01:52:46,159 --> 01:52:48,821
oh! Brother if you could have seen the face
of Bhrigu...

915
01:52:49,095 --> 01:52:49,959
Bravo! Bravo!...

916
01:52:51,631 --> 01:52:52,962
but you are the inspiration...

917
01:53:02,842 --> 01:53:03,740
You?...

918
01:53:06,012 --> 01:53:10,176
I can't remain alone...
I start fidgeting in the evening...

919
01:53:12,285 --> 01:53:14,082
I feel like dancing...

920
01:53:14,387 --> 01:53:15,877
You're very happy,
receive a letter?...

921
01:53:16,489 --> 01:53:17,353
Didn't I tell you?...

922
01:53:21,294 --> 01:53:25,094
I received one about a week ago...
and was ordered to reply immediately.

923
01:53:25,431 --> 01:53:26,331
Did you reply?

924
01:53:29,969 --> 01:53:30,669
No...

925
01:53:33,339 --> 01:53:35,034
He has written from the continent
there is no value to the engagement...

926
01:53:38,378 --> 01:53:40,243
we will never be united...

927
01:53:42,415 --> 01:53:44,548
He will have to stay for another 5 years

928
01:53:44,549 --> 01:53:47,375
and I have to arrange my
own passport and go there...

929
01:53:47,754 --> 01:53:50,181
on my reply he will send money...

930
01:53:50,182 --> 01:53:55,183
within 3 days if I do not answer
I will be released from the bond...

931
01:54:06,206 --> 01:54:07,104
I have decided to go...

932
01:54:08,641 --> 01:54:09,505
I'll ask brother to arrange
for the passport...

933
01:54:11,878 --> 01:54:12,742
but will not inform him...

934
01:54:14,514 --> 01:54:18,280
already it is 7 days instead of 3 days...
he is not at all worried...

935
01:54:19,352 --> 01:54:21,183
at the most he will sent another cable
along with money...

936
01:54:25,458 --> 01:54:26,258
but Bhrigu,

937
01:54:28,795 --> 01:54:31,286
I feel relieved from
a great responsibility...

938
01:54:32,732 --> 01:54:38,732
he will never come back...

939
01:54:38,740 --> 01:54:44,633
but I will have to go
leaving everything here...

940
01:54:45,979 --> 01:54:50,142
doesn't he understand how painful

941
01:54:50,143 --> 01:54:53,044
that would be for me...

942
01:54:53,152 --> 01:54:54,380
is he devoid of sympathy...

943
01:55:05,165 --> 01:55:06,259
Spineless criminal...

944
01:55:07,901 --> 01:55:10,267
playing with the life of a girl
year after year...

945
01:55:11,704 --> 01:55:13,137
and you... a great fool...

946
01:55:35,295 --> 01:55:37,525
I will never forgive you...

947
01:55:44,804 --> 01:55:46,499
Anasua don't go...

948
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:11,990
Oh! Sister... sister...

949
01:56:15,501 --> 01:56:17,469
give a paise...

950
01:56:21,407 --> 01:56:22,207
get me some money...

951
01:56:23,643 --> 01:56:25,076
give me your purse...

952
01:56:33,286 --> 01:56:35,914
the old teacher came to the meeting...

953
01:56:36,789 --> 01:56:38,984
he isn't able to return...
I will put him on a train...

954
01:56:40,393 --> 01:56:41,121
this is as much a responsibility
of yours as mine...

955
01:56:48,534 --> 01:56:51,833
don't stick to a pose like that...
that reminds me of my dead sister...

956
01:56:55,775 --> 01:56:57,436
I heard about you from Bhrigu...
he has judged you right...

957
01:57:10,123 --> 01:57:15,117
Fine ladies like you found in Bengal,
boys like us survive...

958
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:21,100
be here.

959
01:57:30,009 --> 01:57:32,534
Sister... sister... give me a paise...

960
01:57:42,355 --> 01:57:46,689
Sister... sister...

961
01:58:18,524 --> 01:58:19,224
Brother...

962
01:58:26,666 --> 01:58:28,691
I realize what a fool I was...

963
01:58:33,306 --> 01:58:34,796
I can't live without Bhrigu...

964
01:58:40,379 --> 01:58:42,939
A boy has come from Paris...

965
01:58:43,749 --> 01:58:44,647
he said his name is Samar

966
01:58:45,318 --> 01:58:46,376
he's waiting for you...

967
01:59:21,420 --> 01:59:24,321
You drag me here... ok...

968
01:59:25,024 --> 01:59:25,991
but it is not good...

969
01:59:28,261 --> 01:59:29,990
We catch people like this...

970
01:59:30,196 --> 01:59:30,896
Debu...

971
01:59:32,031 --> 01:59:34,522
I am going to check the Pandal...

972
01:59:38,671 --> 01:59:41,970
Shibnath, whatever you done is over... But
please don't do it again.

973
01:59:42,441 --> 01:59:48,107
No... no... I think it was a sudden rush of
blood...

974
01:59:55,621 --> 01:59:56,883
these girls always come late.

975
02:00:01,794 --> 02:00:02,694
How are you?

976
02:00:06,399 --> 02:00:07,263
Shibu...

977
02:00:07,833 --> 02:00:08,857
He has come back...

978
02:00:13,906 --> 02:00:18,673
Anasua has gone to Dum Dum...
I heard from her house...

979
02:00:18,778 --> 02:00:19,777
she has gone to the airport...

980
02:00:19,779 --> 02:00:22,147
along with her brother and a person
who came from a foreign...

981
02:00:25,985 --> 02:00:27,612
she has not left any message...

982
02:00:27,887 --> 02:00:28,876
Bhrigu, what do we do now...

983
02:01:02,455 --> 02:01:03,581
Welcome... Welcome...

984
02:01:04,857 --> 02:01:08,953
Ya, we arrived...
all the arrangements are ready...

985
02:01:09,328 --> 02:01:11,694
The problem is that... Anasua...

986
02:01:11,864 --> 02:01:14,128
Anasua... she has come long back...
she is waiting.

987
02:01:51,871 --> 02:01:52,571
Come...

988
02:01:53,139 --> 02:01:54,936
There was a blind darvish in our village

989
02:01:55,508 --> 02:01:56,507
he used to sing

990
02:01:59,145 --> 02:02:00,669
O! Suleman

991
02:02:01,480 --> 02:02:04,506
the sky is full of music

992
02:02:05,785 --> 02:02:10,779
these are all the gifts of god

993
02:02:12,658 --> 02:02:15,991
Lord be praised.

994
02:03:31,804 --> 02:03:33,101
I left him...

995
02:03:34,340 --> 02:03:35,240
he went back...

996
02:03:37,977 --> 02:03:43,574
will you accept me after all this...

997
02:03:44,049 --> 02:03:47,143
Bhrigu, a dangerous situation...

998
02:03:48,454 --> 02:03:51,548
in the middle of a field suddenly Jaya said
she loves me...

999
02:03:51,757 --> 02:03:53,088
crying profusely...

1000
02:03:58,597 --> 02:03:59,859
says she will commit suicide...

1001
02:04:03,602 --> 02:04:05,229
I said you would marry an unemployed
person like me...

1002
02:04:05,838 --> 02:04:06,738
Do I beat him...

1003
02:04:12,711 --> 02:04:14,736
Well, I will marry you...

1004
02:04:15,014 --> 02:04:16,538
I like you...

1005
02:04:45,845 --> 02:04:51,477
After the show, we need to move somewhere
else, come quick...

1006
02:04:56,322 --> 02:04:59,849
I went to fetch water

1007
02:05:03,128 --> 02:05:07,531
and caught a glimpse of lord Krishna
