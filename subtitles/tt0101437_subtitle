1
00:00:54,134 --> 00:00:57,251
"Children, have you written
four lines about your mother..."

2
00:00:57,304 --> 00:01:01,820
...which I had told you to write.
- Yes Master-Very good.

3
00:01:06,513 --> 00:01:23,784
"Raju, have you written or not.
- It is blank, do U sleep in class"

4
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:30,906
Answer me. Only this stick
will make you speak.

5
00:01:41,748 --> 00:01:42,897
"Master, please don't beat him."

6
00:01:42,783 --> 00:01:47,379
How can he write when
he does'nt have a mother

7
00:03:59,986 --> 00:04:02,341
"Call from Delhi
- Sir, your call from Delhi."

8
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:06,906
"Yes, I am Prem here,
Shrivastav!"

9
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:10,363
"Ramu uncle, with whom is my
father speaking."

10
00:04:10,363 --> 00:04:14,197
With someone in Delhi.
- But Delhi is very far.

11
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:21,332
"Not only to Delhi, we can
speak to anyone in sky by phone"

12
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:29,201
"Don't worry your work will be
done. Come Raju, let's have food."

13
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,032
I want the number to God's
house- What?

14
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:03,106
I want to speak to my mother.
- Is your mother in God's house.

15
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:09,455
"Yes, can you tell her that her
son Raju is calling her."

16
00:05:11,124 --> 00:05:14,275
"Wait, Neeta It is a boy
asking for God's phone number"

17
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,310
He wants to speak to
his mother.

18
00:05:16,363 --> 00:05:20,481
Why dont you speak to the poor
boy - Forget it

19
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:25,049
"Come on, nothing will happen if
you speak for two minutes."

20
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:31,001
Ok- Speak to your mother.

21
00:05:35,582 --> 00:05:45,696
"Mother, I am your son Raju.
- Yes, won't I identify my son?"

22
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:53,188
How are you mother?
- I am fine.

23
00:05:53,199 --> 00:06:01,675
I miss you. You take a holiday
from God and come to me.

24
00:06:01,675 --> 00:06:07,591
I cannot come.
- Why? Don't you love me.

25
00:06:07,514 --> 00:06:13,510
"I love you a lot.
- Then, why can't you come?"

26
00:06:13,586 --> 00:06:19,582
"If I have done some mistake,
I will catch my ears,"

27
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:27,657
"I promise, I will never trouble
you or make any mistake."

28
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:33,597
Please come I want to see you
and talk to you.

29
00:06:33,673 --> 00:06:35,868
I want to keep my head on your
lap and sleep.

30
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:40,179
Don't cry. Are'nt you my brave
son. -Now I am telling you very...

31
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:45,493
"...clearly, day after tommorow
is my birthday and if you don't..."

32
00:06:45,518 --> 00:06:48,715
...come I will stop eating and
drinking and give my life.

33
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:52,634
"No, You must not say that.
- Then promise that you will..."

34
00:06:52,559 --> 00:07:00,239
...come for my birthday.
- I will come. -Don't forget.

35
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:06,833
Till you come I will not cut the
cake. -I will surely come.

36
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:22,791
"Okay mother. - Father, see
mother is going to come."

37
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:26,225
I just spoke to her and she said
she would come for my birthday

38
00:07:32,932 --> 00:07:36,925
"Yes, son, your mother will surely
come on your birthday"

39
00:07:45,211 --> 00:07:47,202
"Raju, cut the cake quickly, we
are feeling hungry."

40
00:07:47,113 --> 00:07:52,346
"Not now, after mother comes
- Nobody comes from God's home"

41
00:07:52,552 --> 00:07:54,429
My mother will surely come as
she has herself told me.

42
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:59,549
"Must be your mother's ghost.
- Lf you call her a ghost, I..."

43
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:08,102
...will kill you. - Light has gone
- What happened to the light?

44
00:08:10,203 --> 00:08:22,673
"Father lied as usual, today
also he did'nt bring my mother."

45
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:04,188
Mother - Son!

46
00:09:51,404 --> 00:09:53,793
The days of happiness
have come.

47
00:09:57,243 --> 00:10:00,758
I have got whatever I
asked for.

48
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:12,858
Today my mother has
called me as son.

49
00:10:26,072 --> 00:10:30,509
Mother! My mother!

50
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:42,529
"Master, my mother has come.
Aunty, my mother has come."

51
00:11:07,013 --> 00:11:17,287
"Mother, I want to grow on your
lap & hold your finger and walk."

52
00:11:17,323 --> 00:11:23,922
I want to pray before you
as you are my God

53
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:29,971
Everywhere I see
only your form

54
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:38,558
The days of happiness
have come.

55
00:11:38,444 --> 00:11:41,561
I have got whatever I
asked for.

56
00:11:41,447 --> 00:11:46,521
Today my mother has
called me as son.

57
00:12:14,313 --> 00:12:17,350
Are you seeing what I can see
- Yes!

58
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:23,136
Take your medicine
on time

59
00:12:25,224 --> 00:12:29,502
"My dear sister, why did
you leave us and come?"

60
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:34,523
It looked like my funeral when
you left for your husband's home

61
00:12:34,434 --> 00:12:38,188
He cried so much that it looked
as if a drainage pipe has broken

62
00:12:38,137 --> 00:12:41,209
Not drainage but water pipe
- Both are the same.

63
00:12:41,274 --> 00:12:45,586
"Brother-in-law, we won't leave
you and go now."

64
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,619
"Totharam, you can stay with us.
- Lakshmi, take them inside..."

65
00:12:51,517 --> 00:12:56,272
I will meet the collector and
come. -Brother-in-law is nice

66
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:07,523
He is nice. Have you transferred
all property in your name by now

67
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:19,459
"Don't worry, brother, everything
will be ours in some days."

68
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:28,381
"Sister, we are lost. Did you see
this will? -What is there in it?"

69
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:33,575
We conducted our sister's
marriage with Prembabu so...

70
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:41,616
...she gets the property. But he
is only the caretaker of property.

71
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:47,372
He has no rights over it.
Raju's mother has written...

72
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:50,365
...all property in Raju's name
before her death.

73
00:13:56,115 --> 00:14:00,393
She has also written that till
Raju is married and without...

74
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:06,574
"...his wife's permission, he can't
transfer his property to someone."

75
00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:10,380
But what will happen to the one
which is going to born to Maina

76
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:18,361
He should also gets his rights.
- My son will surely get his right

77
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:25,143
"I will control in such a way that
he will tell only "mother"..."

78
00:14:25,077 --> 00:14:33,633
...always in his whole life
till he dies.

79
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:42,638
"How much? -16 "Mans"
"-Collect while you come back"

80
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:49,332
"Son, do you know, how much
this accountant has studied?"

81
00:14:49,268 --> 00:14:53,580
"A lot, he speaks English also
- Still, why does he bow before..."

82
00:14:53,606 --> 00:14:58,760
"...us- That is because, learned
people respect others."

83
00:15:00,546 --> 00:15:03,538
"No, son, he bows as we have
lots of money which your father..."

84
00:15:03,616 --> 00:15:08,246
"...earned by working in the fields
- But, by studying only..."

85
00:15:08,221 --> 00:15:15,775
"No, son, let me explain to you,
see how everybody is bowing..."

86
00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:21,074
...before your father. That man
with black coat is a lawyer

87
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:27,858
One is Tahsildar and all are
educated & are only servants.

88
00:15:27,974 --> 00:15:31,603
"I won't be a servant and
become a master, mother"

89
00:15:31,577 --> 00:15:34,808
"From now on you work in the
fields, as read treasure is not..."

90
00:15:35,014 --> 00:15:44,889
"...in books but one earth. Give,
Let me throw these books."

91
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:49,164
"Not this as "Ma" is written in
this. I will tear this book."

92
00:16:12,785 --> 00:16:17,301
"See son, this part of our fields
is barren for many years."

93
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:22,762
"Nothing grows here, not even
grass. With hard work, you..."

94
00:16:22,762 --> 00:16:28,519
...should convert this into
a greenery. -What are you doing?

95
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:32,426
Such a large burden on a small
boy. The field which could not...

96
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:35,694
"...be cultivated by strong men,
can a boy do that?"

97
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:41,663
Mother! - Put me down!
- See now lush the fields are

98
00:17:41,741 --> 00:17:45,814
This was just a barren land.
If you tell me...

99
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:48,509
...I would have converted even
a desert into green fields.

100
00:17:48,447 --> 00:17:51,678
How will a son not listen
to his mother's words?

101
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:10,728
Tired so soon! - Looks as if
brother Ramesh is leaving the...

102
00:18:10,703 --> 00:18:14,855
"...house permanently. So heavy,
that I am dead."

103
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,336
What you are whispering to your
wife? Did U keep things properly?

104
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:23,020
Yes- Then close it now.
Nothing should be left behind

105
00:18:30,356 --> 00:18:35,794
"Hurry up, Ramesh, it is late.
- Will remember you a lot, Uncle"

106
00:18:35,795 --> 00:18:38,229
Take my memory along with you!

107
00:18:45,938 --> 00:18:47,690
Am I a demon that she is
shouting.

108
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,677
"No, but God Narayan also is
scared of naked ones"

109
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:54,816
But I am wearing clothes
- But where! - Go fast!

110
00:19:07,927 --> 00:19:11,397
"What you mean by obstructing
the way, we are already late"

111
00:19:11,397 --> 00:19:15,515
We are only delaying you but you
have brought darkness into our...

112
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:20,767
...lives by snatching our fields.
- Which field? That land...

113
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:22,842
...belongs to us and will
remain ours only.

114
00:19:22,908 --> 00:19:27,743
That land is our ancestor's.
If you don't hand it over...

115
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:34,916
"...properly, I can use improper
means-Whom are you threatening"

116
00:19:34,954 --> 00:19:41,905
Do anything you can do
I don't face dogs like you.

117
00:20:00,546 --> 00:20:04,141
"It is time for the train to leave,
still Raju has not come."

118
00:20:06,652 --> 00:20:13,649
"Mother, I got Badam Halwa made
for Ramesh and got late."

119
00:20:16,428 --> 00:20:21,422
"The train started, get inside.
Pay respect to mother."

120
00:20:28,774 --> 00:20:34,087
"I forgot to give this. Have
everyday, brain will be sharp."

121
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:39,195
This is your last year. Work
hard. Mother's dream is that...

122
00:20:39,285 --> 00:20:42,960
...you should become a big
doctor & you should fulfil that

123
00:20:55,534 --> 00:21:00,892
What do you mean by this?
- Sign quietly or... - Rogue!

124
00:21:00,906 --> 00:21:04,979
You are also not good. The
whole village knows how...

125
00:21:04,877 --> 00:21:10,873
"...wicked U are. When thousands
die, a sinner like you is born."

126
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,869
You abused my mother!

127
00:21:38,811 --> 00:21:41,530
I won't leave you at all.

128
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:34,231
Leave me!

129
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:46,312
"Leave him, Raju!
- I tell you, leave him."

130
00:23:25,551 --> 00:23:28,270
"Is this just? When he was
asking for his right, he..."

131
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,257
...tried to take away his life
- He does'nt know right or...

132
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:34,148
...wrong. He is blind in his
mother's love.

133
00:23:34,226 --> 00:23:39,698
"God knows how she has
enchanted him, Raju loves her"

134
00:23:39,698 --> 00:23:42,371
...more than her own son.
She has made him mad.

135
00:23:42,501 --> 00:23:45,379
"Raju is only her step son, but
she has imprisoned her own..."

136
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:47,223
...husband by making him mad.

137
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:06,308
"Babuji, eat this before that
demoness comes."

138
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:16,083
"My heart is hungry, not my
stomach. Even animals fill..."

139
00:24:15,968 --> 00:24:19,802
...their stomach by dry things
But I want to live like a human

140
00:24:19,738 --> 00:24:23,811
I want to come out of here.
I am dying here

141
00:24:28,247 --> 00:24:33,321
"Be patient, Babuji
Shall I ask something?"

142
00:24:33,552 --> 00:24:41,391
Why are you in this dark room?
Can't understand anything

143
00:24:44,763 --> 00:24:49,075
"It is a story of 20 years, when I
had brought a mother for Raju"

144
00:24:51,904 --> 00:24:54,338
But I did'nt know that she had
married me only for money

145
00:24:54,339 --> 00:24:59,094
"When she knew, that all the
property was in Raju's name..."

146
00:24:59,044 --> 00:25:03,356
...she stopped his studies to
bring him under her control.

147
00:25:05,651 --> 00:25:07,164
When I learnt this from his
master!

148
00:25:07,152 --> 00:25:09,029
"If you don't go to school,
I will break your legs"

149
00:25:10,689 --> 00:25:15,126
"Don't beat the innocent child, I
have told his mother many times."

150
00:25:15,127 --> 00:25:20,679
"But she did'nt listen- She is
aware of this, then"

151
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:25,740
"To remove me from the path, my
wife & her brother conspired..."

152
00:25:42,254 --> 00:25:44,370
"As soon as brother-in-law
regains consciousness, give him..."

153
00:25:44,256 --> 00:25:47,726
"...another dose, sister
- My head is aching"

154
00:25:47,726 --> 00:25:50,479
"You take this drug, everything
will be alright. -No, I won't!"

155
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:55,790
"But taking advantage, she gave
me a medicine which made me..."

156
00:25:55,868 --> 00:25:57,824
...mad for some time.

157
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:06,151
Save me

158
00:26:10,082 --> 00:26:11,800
I understood that all this
conspiracy was my wife's.

159
00:26:13,385 --> 00:26:16,536
You are provoking innocent Raju
also to go against me.

160
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:20,972
I won't leave you and
will kill you. Raju!

161
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:24,508
He has killed my nephew!

162
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:32,312
"Then, I was declared mad. I
don't feel sad that the whole..."

163
00:26:32,237 --> 00:26:44,945
"...world calls me mad, but my
own son also thinks I am mad"

164
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:53,291
"We know, nothing is wrong with
you and one day brother Raju..."

165
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:58,320
"...will also learn the truth.
Come and sit, Babuji"

166
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:06,383
"Have your food,
Babuji"

167
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:21,932
"If you repeat this daring, I will
kick you out of the house."

168
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,832
"Don't look at his chicken,
go away!"

169
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:34,014
"Brother-in-law will you eat this,
this is good, eat!"

170
00:27:52,718 --> 00:27:56,267
"Raju, the invitation of Ram
Prasad' son marriage has come"

171
00:27:56,254 --> 00:27:59,371
"Has invited both of us.
- You only go, mother"

172
00:27:59,257 --> 00:28:03,136
"They are our near relations. They
will feel bad, if we don't go."

173
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:06,178
"Ok, when should we go?
- By tomorrow morning"

174
00:28:19,144 --> 00:28:21,055
"Come fast, marriage
procession has come."

175
00:29:05,991 --> 00:29:08,027
"Saraswati, your dupatta has
gone. -Choti"

176
00:29:10,562 --> 00:29:12,439
Go & bring my dupatta
from that man.

177
00:29:27,312 --> 00:29:28,347
"Take this, sister."

178
00:29:46,598 --> 00:29:51,274
"Are you Raju? Everybody
is waiting for you, come."

179
00:29:57,342 --> 00:30:00,015
Was I dreaming?

180
00:30:07,085 --> 00:30:11,203
"Where is this Raju? - He is a
youth, must be roaming!"

181
00:30:14,192 --> 00:30:17,104
Where were you? - I...
- Now sit here

182
00:30:20,265 --> 00:30:23,382
"Call the bride.
- What happened, son?"

183
00:30:32,611 --> 00:30:33,600
Just got hiccups!

184
00:31:10,215 --> 00:31:16,290
"Raju, where are you going
now? - Hiccups & water!"

185
00:31:16,188 --> 00:31:18,577
Go & drink water and come.

186
00:31:38,743 --> 00:31:42,656
"Your teeth are very nice, you use
Monkeybrand tooth powder!"

187
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:51,580
I also use the same.
See! - Take the juice.

188
00:31:53,658 --> 00:31:56,218
"No, don't drink that.
You go away from here"

189
00:31:56,194 --> 00:31:58,310
"Why should'nt I drink,
I am thirsty."

190
00:31:58,363 --> 00:32:04,518
Your good lies in not drinking
this juice. You go away.

191
00:32:07,305 --> 00:32:10,502
Why did you stop me from
having the juice? -Your name!

192
00:32:10,542 --> 00:32:19,132
"Saraswati- Listen, there was ice
in that juice. That would have..."

193
00:32:19,117 --> 00:32:26,273
...made you cough & fever'll come
which can develop into...

194
00:32:26,157 --> 00:32:34,394
"...penumonia, which I would'nt
have liked."

195
00:32:46,711 --> 00:32:48,349
Your friend got annoyed
and went.

196
00:32:48,313 --> 00:32:52,386
There is only one way to pacify
her. She likes roses a lot.

197
00:32:58,423 --> 00:33:02,541
Take one rose from that fat
woman's hair and give it.

198
00:33:11,069 --> 00:33:13,742
See there!

199
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:05,537
I wanted a rose but this
bouquet has come into this.

200
00:34:14,366 --> 00:34:18,518
"This is not fair. I have already
given the 3 lakhs, I promised."

201
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,209
From where will I bring
another 2 lakhs now.

202
00:34:21,172 --> 00:34:26,292
"When 3 lakhs was decided,
economy was low, but now..."

203
00:34:26,344 --> 00:34:29,575
...my son's value has increased.
Now marriage will take place...

204
00:34:29,614 --> 00:34:32,253
...only if 5 lakhs are given. Or I
will go with my son now.

205
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:40,915
"Come here, Tulsiramji & son!
I am your well-wisher and to..."

206
00:34:40,825 --> 00:34:45,421
...give right advice is my duty.
Now government is very...

207
00:34:45,397 --> 00:34:49,754
...strict with dowry seekers. If
somebody complains against you...

208
00:34:49,768 --> 00:34:56,446
...police will beat you with
shoes. Then they will catch...

209
00:34:56,408 --> 00:35:08,047
...you & you'll be imprisoned for
3 years in jail & made to slog

210
00:35:36,247 --> 00:35:39,842
We will take leave- You
increased our prestige by coming

211
00:35:39,818 --> 00:35:41,410
That was our duty

212
00:35:41,386 --> 00:35:45,504
Where will I get Ms. Saraswati?
- Why?

213
00:35:45,557 --> 00:35:49,345
I have come to give her
photographs- Give it to me

214
00:35:49,294 --> 00:35:56,052
"Who are you? - I am her...
- Oh that, give this to her"

215
00:37:04,435 --> 00:37:09,953
My heart started beating
and started getting scared.

216
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:21,942
"Beloved, please leave
my hands"

217
00:37:33,765 --> 00:37:39,123
Our hearts have met then why
you are you still shy.

218
00:37:48,346 --> 00:37:54,137
"You are my lover,
how beautiful you look!"

219
00:38:40,431 --> 00:38:45,551
"When you called me mine,
I started having sweet dreams"

220
00:38:45,603 --> 00:38:52,918
"From the time I saw you,
my mind is awakened, my queen"

221
00:38:52,944 --> 00:39:00,100
You magic has spread
into my whole body.

222
00:38:59,984 --> 00:39:07,572
"I started forgetting myself, and
hold you in my breath now."

223
00:39:07,558 --> 00:39:13,747
What is this relation which
has maddened both of us?

224
00:40:02,246 --> 00:40:08,196
"Your black hair is entangled,
allow me to set it right."

225
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:16,037
"What is your union, let
the time for our union come."

226
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:23,196
"Don't make reasons and
come into my arms, dear"

227
00:40:23,234 --> 00:40:30,663
"Don't meet my eyes like that,
what will the others think"

228
00:40:30,675 --> 00:40:36,386
"There is merry all around,
come and hug me."

229
00:40:36,514 --> 00:40:43,033
My heart started beating
and started getting scared.

230
00:40:51,696 --> 00:40:54,768
"Beloved, please leave
my hands"

231
00:41:06,611 --> 00:41:11,969
Our hearts have met then why
you are you still shy.

232
00:41:54,025 --> 00:41:56,334
"Where has she gone, from
where you come, now?"

233
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,590
You are making me swing for the
last two hours. Now you...

234
00:41:58,629 --> 00:42:03,419
"...ask me how I came. Thank
God, I stopped you on time."

235
00:42:03,367 --> 00:42:05,437
"Otherwise, I could'nt have shown
my face to anyone."

236
00:42:05,336 --> 00:42:08,692
"I had such a nice dream, you
spoiled everything, you donkey"

237
00:42:12,176 --> 00:42:14,087
"Tell me, who came into your
dreams- Saraswati!"

238
00:42:14,011 --> 00:42:21,122
You started loving her. Don't be
scared. This Hanuman promises...

239
00:42:21,185 --> 00:42:25,815
...that he will definitely
unite Sita & Ram. Give Rs. 200-

240
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:31,183
You take Rs. 400- but you make
me meet her- Done!

241
00:42:39,303 --> 00:42:40,861
Thief! Stealing in front
of a policeman

242
00:42:47,778 --> 00:42:50,053
It is already afternoon searching
for her. Have'nt seen her yet.

243
00:42:50,081 --> 00:42:52,914
You search that side.
I will search this side.

244
00:43:11,802 --> 00:43:20,039
"Khan -Sultana, what happened?
- One man teased me & ran away"

245
00:43:20,077 --> 00:43:23,831
I will see to him

246
00:43:39,397 --> 00:43:40,466
Sister-in-law!

247
00:43:43,334 --> 00:43:47,452
"Khanji, he only teased me!"

248
00:43:47,338 --> 00:43:56,849
"I won't leave you, you tease her
twice - But only once!"

249
00:43:56,847 --> 00:44:05,243
I will shoot you! -ls it duplicate
- No real- Run!

250
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:13,321
Why are you beating me?

251
00:44:16,033 --> 00:44:19,184
"Brother Raju! -Did you get her?
- Yes, got a lot!"

252
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:24,940
You told me lies that I will get
her in the fair & took Rs. 200-

253
00:44:43,527 --> 00:44:48,920
"Listen, see there -I got her
- Tell us also what you got."

254
00:44:50,201 --> 00:44:52,237
He is the same one who was
after me in the marriage also.

255
00:44:52,136 --> 00:44:59,975
"Then, let us run away from
here-Tell us what you got."

256
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:05,985
He got his loved one
- Where is she?

257
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:19,211
How did this happen? How did
my good sister-in-law became...

258
00:45:19,096 --> 00:45:24,409
...donkey before marriage. Now
Raju brother has to become a...

259
00:45:24,435 --> 00:45:28,110
"...donkey now. -Fool, this is not
your sister-in-law, come"

260
00:45:34,145 --> 00:45:40,175
We will sit on that & have fun.
Can't you see and come.

261
00:45:52,129 --> 00:46:00,002
"Give me a kiss-Have no teeth
& want a kiss, old man!"

262
00:46:11,849 --> 00:46:25,684
"Oldy, U don't kiss me but ask
others for it. Will teach U! Come"

263
00:46:32,002 --> 00:46:35,119
"Because of your madness, she
vanished-You were also mad."

264
00:46:42,513 --> 00:46:47,064
"How much money do you have?
- Rs. 5,000-"

265
00:46:52,556 --> 00:47:02,227
"Listen everybody, this girl is
lost, whoever finds her will..."

266
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:16,193
"...get a prize of Rs. 5,000-
- Let us find the girl."

267
00:47:24,655 --> 00:47:33,006
"Come, the girl worth Rs. 5,000-
on God's name. There she is!"

268
00:47:43,707 --> 00:47:48,986
I am going as I feel giddy
- Are you hurt? -

269
00:47:58,956 --> 00:48:04,394
What is the time? - 11:30
God bless you- Come!

270
00:48:24,548 --> 00:48:30,145
Khan saab- See there!
Don't leave him.

271
00:48:40,598 --> 00:48:42,077
How much is it?
- Two rupees

272
00:49:01,585 --> 00:49:03,541
"There is the girl worth
Rs. 5,000-"

273
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:20,159
"Those rogues are troubling me
- You go, I can't help you!"

274
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:23,949
"She is the girl of
Rs. 5000-, constable"

275
00:49:40,024 --> 00:49:42,060
"Don't shout, can't you see that
the matter is fixed now."

276
00:49:49,133 --> 00:49:51,727
"Move away, I saw her
first! - No, me!"

277
00:49:58,409 --> 00:50:01,207
So you have put these rogues
behind me. What do you want?

278
00:50:01,145 --> 00:50:06,299
I feel shy to tell. -You are
behind me like a shameless.

279
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:11,629
What is the relation between us
- Can call it relation of ages.

280
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:20,797
"With you. Have you seen your
face on the mirror, monkey!"

281
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:26,872
Open this fast. Has come
like a big prince.

282
00:50:52,429 --> 00:50:57,662
I am Bhairav Singh Rana. If
someone sees me once...

283
00:50:57,701 --> 00:51:01,376
...they can't forget it for
seven births.

284
00:51:03,407 --> 00:51:09,721
I got 2 years imprisonment due
to your father's statement...

285
00:51:09,747 --> 00:51:19,304
...just for raping a girl. Today
I will rape you in front of all.

286
00:51:30,367 --> 00:51:31,641
Leave me!

287
00:54:09,927 --> 00:54:13,044
"Pandit, marry this donkey to
another donkey, so he never..."

288
00:54:13,096 --> 00:54:16,566
"...teases another girl in the
village, do it!"

289
00:54:26,577 --> 00:54:28,090
"It is already evening, let me
leave you in your house."

290
00:54:28,078 --> 00:54:31,115
"Pandu, tell mother that I will
come home late."

291
00:54:44,728 --> 00:54:50,564
This cyclone is furious. We will
have to wait here till it subsides

292
00:54:55,439 --> 00:54:57,794
You are shivering with cold.
Come and sit here.

293
00:54:57,808 --> 00:55:01,801
I will light a fire in the
meantime. You inhale the...

294
00:55:01,712 --> 00:55:10,666
"...heat otherwise you will get
cough, fever & your body..."

295
00:55:10,587 --> 00:55:26,026
"...will pain & then... - I will get
pneumonia, which you won't like."

296
00:55:32,743 --> 00:55:36,782
"Raju, U have done a great favour
by saving my prestige today."

297
00:55:36,847 --> 00:55:44,606
Not at all. It's the duty of every
man to protect a lady's respect.

298
00:55:47,658 --> 00:55:52,686
"Your hands are hurt- Nothing,
just a scratch, it will be fine."

299
00:55:55,866 --> 00:56:02,977
A small scratch will become a
big wound and get septic and...

300
00:56:02,873 --> 00:56:12,942
...poison will spread & yourhand
will be cut which I would'nt like.

301
00:56:15,919 --> 00:56:19,036
"You have returned my own
shot, Saraswatiji"

302
00:56:50,954 --> 00:56:53,070
Your voice is like the
Cuckoo's.

303
00:56:58,128 --> 00:57:02,201
Your face is so innocent.

304
00:57:16,747 --> 00:57:21,775
Your eyes are filled with
kajal & lips are like fire.

305
00:57:21,852 --> 00:57:25,891
My heart is getting lost
after seeing me.

306
00:57:25,956 --> 00:57:36,992
Your words are musical and
enchant my mind always.

307
00:57:42,305 --> 00:57:46,139
Your colours attract me.

308
00:57:46,076 --> 00:57:51,196
Something is happening
to me after seeing me.

309
00:58:39,663 --> 00:58:45,101
You are queen of youth and you
are blossoming with fragrance.

310
00:58:45,101 --> 00:58:51,176
"When I am near you, our breaths
also filled with fragrance."

311
00:59:10,994 --> 00:59:16,910
You are spreading nectar
- My life is yearning for you

312
00:59:16,833 --> 00:59:20,826
Your bangles are taking
away my consciousness.

313
00:59:20,904 --> 00:59:26,058
You have made my yearn!
- You took away my peace

314
00:59:25,942 --> 00:59:35,340
Your words are musical and
enchant my mind always.

315
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:42,479
Your colours attract me.

316
00:59:46,863 --> 00:59:50,492
Something is happening
to me after seeing me.

317
01:00:24,834 --> 01:00:30,943
You touched my body and
my mind is in turmoil.

318
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:36,870
Your flying veil is making
my heart to dance.

319
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:00,536
Colour has been added to
me by your love.

320
01:01:00,704 --> 01:01:02,979
My whole age is writing
only your name.

321
01:01:03,006 --> 01:01:06,237
I will become a bride and
come to your house

322
01:01:06,276 --> 01:01:11,828
I am thirsty to unite with you
- How to tell the fire in me?

323
01:01:11,815 --> 01:01:14,887
Your voice is like the
Cuckoo's.

324
01:01:19,422 --> 01:01:21,538
Your face is so innocent.

325
01:01:26,129 --> 01:01:31,249
Your eyes are filled with
kajal & lips are like fire.

326
01:01:31,301 --> 01:01:35,499
My heart is getting lost
after seeing me.

327
01:01:48,218 --> 01:01:56,091
Where were you lost?
- In somebody's thoughts!

328
01:01:56,026 --> 01:01:59,496
Let me also know that
somebody.

329
01:01:59,496 --> 01:02:05,890
You want to know
- Then come with me.

330
01:02:16,179 --> 01:02:17,009
That is only you!

331
01:02:24,254 --> 01:02:30,170
"Have I made a mistake?
- Yes, a very big one."

332
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:37,481
Think it as a mistake & know
that I love you very much...

333
01:02:37,534 --> 01:02:42,130
...with a true heart. -lt is a sin
for me to hear that

334
01:02:42,105 --> 01:02:47,133
"I am going to marry someone
else, with whom I am engaged."

335
01:03:13,103 --> 01:03:23,172
"Saraswati, Unknowingly I've hurt
you. Let me leave you home now."

336
01:03:32,889 --> 01:03:33,924
There they are coming.

337
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:38,029
I told you before that I
don't believe that.

338
01:03:38,094 --> 01:03:40,654
See there!

339
01:04:25,308 --> 01:04:28,300
"Ask your future daughter-in-law,
where she was the whole..."

340
01:04:28,378 --> 01:04:30,414
...night and what she
was doing?

341
01:04:30,313 --> 01:04:33,305
"Shyam Lalji, you only
ask your daughter."

342
01:04:41,224 --> 01:04:46,457
"Answer me, where were you the
whole night, and what you did?"

343
01:04:48,998 --> 01:04:52,468
"Father, you also think
wrongly about me."

344
01:04:52,468 --> 01:04:56,097
If a young daughter does'nt
return the whole night...

345
01:04:56,072 --> 01:05:00,509
...what will the old father think
and then explain to the society.

346
01:05:00,510 --> 01:05:04,389
I should have died before
seeing this day.

347
01:05:06,115 --> 01:05:09,744
"Sir, nothing went wrong. Whole
night, we were stuck in cyclone"

348
01:05:09,719 --> 01:05:13,837
Which cyclone are you talking
about? The cyclone in your...

349
01:05:13,723 --> 01:05:25,521
...minds or the cyclone which
united a unmarried girl & boy.

350
01:05:28,004 --> 01:05:29,835
It is a lie. -Then were you
praying to her the whole night

351
01:05:34,644 --> 01:05:37,078
She has blackened the image of
the whole village like this.

352
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:40,675
Now who will marry our
daughters and sisters &...

353
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:45,246
"...keep relation with the village
- Whoever has, will also break it"

354
01:05:45,221 --> 01:05:48,293
I am also breaking the
engagement and can't make...

355
01:05:48,191 --> 01:05:53,470
...this characterless girl
as my daughter-in-law

356
01:05:55,999 --> 01:06:00,197
"Please wait, the blame on this
innocent girl is false."

357
01:06:02,138 --> 01:06:07,849
"By God, I say that she is sacred
like Ganga & we did'nt sin at all"

358
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:14,124
Don't break this engagement
- Such a girl can't be kept

359
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:16,220
"...even as a keep, leave
alone marrying her."

360
01:06:18,054 --> 01:06:22,525
"If you are not her would-be
husband, my answer can hit you."

361
01:06:24,727 --> 01:06:29,676
What? First you do a sin and
then beat him also.

362
01:06:33,569 --> 01:06:38,245
"Villagers, show him the result of
playing with prestige of village."

363
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:40,243
Beat him!

364
01:07:38,835 --> 01:07:43,909
Stop! I am telling you to stop!
If somebody beats him again...

365
01:07:43,806 --> 01:07:48,755
...I will cut him-Whom are you
threatening? Beat him

366
01:07:52,648 --> 01:08:00,487
"Bhairav, Hariya, if you have the
courage, beat him and show!"

367
01:08:07,797 --> 01:08:11,676
You are beating an innocent
without mercy. Do you think...

368
01:08:11,601 --> 01:08:16,834
"...he is wearing bangles, and
can't beat you back."

369
01:08:16,873 --> 01:08:21,583
"If he wishes, he can destroy
you all with one single hit."

370
01:08:21,544 --> 01:08:25,423
He is quiet just to see that
I get justice.

371
01:08:25,348 --> 01:08:32,618
"That too, you are worrying about
my prestige. Yesterday you..."

372
01:08:32,655 --> 01:08:37,854
...had come to the fair to rape
me & would have done so...

373
01:08:37,894 --> 01:08:40,806
...if this man had not
saved me.

374
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:48,319
"And you were going to become
husband, a life-long relation."

375
01:08:48,371 --> 01:08:53,320
But you don't know that basis
of husband-wife relation is...

376
01:08:53,242 --> 01:09:02,321
"...belief, and you can't trust me
for one night. Now I tell you."

377
01:09:05,721 --> 01:09:14,834
"You are not fit to become even
a broker, leave alone a husband"

378
01:09:16,299 --> 01:09:18,096
"Keep this bangle given by you,
and get away from here."

379
01:09:33,349 --> 01:09:38,821
"You are only my mother &
father, and I have the culture..."

380
01:09:38,821 --> 01:09:46,819
"...which you have given me. I will
die, but not do such a sinful..."

381
01:09:46,896 --> 01:09:55,850
...which will make you bow in
shame. I will never allow that.

382
01:11:08,778 --> 01:11:10,097
Will you marry me?

383
01:12:01,397 --> 01:12:03,672
"Daughter, fall at her feet,
your fate has opened up."

384
01:12:03,699 --> 01:12:08,056
By accepting the marriage of
my uneducated daughter with...

385
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:10,186
"...your son Raju, you have done
a great favour."

386
01:12:10,406 --> 01:12:14,194
My daughter will serve you as a
servant in your house.

387
01:12:14,143 --> 01:12:17,931
Look for a auspicious day soon
and conduct the marriage.

388
01:12:25,721 --> 01:12:29,873
"Sister, I don't know why you
selected this pauper."

389
01:12:29,759 --> 01:12:33,798
"If you had seen a rich family,
lot of dowry would have come"

390
01:12:33,863 --> 01:12:39,142
"Don't talk foolishly. As per
Raju's mother's will, he can't..."

391
01:12:39,168 --> 01:12:46,006
...transfer his property to anyone
without his wife's consent.

392
01:12:45,941 --> 01:12:50,253
I understood. You can take Raju's
wife's thumb impression also...

393
01:12:50,446 --> 01:12:54,598
"...Raju's and can seize all
his property, sister."

394
01:13:00,489 --> 01:13:01,717
"Mother, brother Raju has come."

395
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:11,179
"Raju, where were you last night,
I was very much worried."

396
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:14,318
I got stuck in a cyclone
- It is ok.

397
01:13:14,203 --> 01:13:22,520
I have to tell you a very good
news today- I also have a...

398
01:13:22,545 --> 01:13:27,539
"...good news, mother-
What is it? - Saraswati!"

399
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:53,099
She is my mother! -She is
your daughter-in-law.

400
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:15,078
The situation was only such that
we were compelled to marry.

401
01:14:27,209 --> 01:14:29,006
Won't you take the blessings
of your mother?

402
01:14:36,519 --> 01:14:39,397
Mother! - I bless you-Are you
unhappy with my marriage

403
01:14:39,321 --> 01:14:42,950
How can a mother be not happy
when her son's life is settled.

404
01:14:42,925 --> 01:14:46,042
"My happiness lies only in your
happiness. -Really, mother"

405
01:14:45,928 --> 01:14:49,318
You saw how good my mother
is. She is not upset by our...

406
01:14:49,331 --> 01:14:53,324
"...marriage at all. Ma, I don't need
anything else but your happiness."

407
01:15:02,545 --> 01:15:07,573
All our dreams are lost. The
way you are welcoming that girl...

408
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:12,485
...it looks as if we have to leave
for Haridwar soon with our bags

409
01:15:12,588 --> 01:15:18,424
"Do something, sister
- She left without speaking"

410
01:15:20,696 --> 01:15:22,368
"During the dice game in
Mahabharata, Shakuni also left..."

411
01:15:22,331 --> 01:15:26,370
"...smiling, but it resulted in
Draupati's insult."

412
01:15:26,268 --> 01:15:30,386
"Don't worry, sister will definitely
plan some conspiracy."

413
01:15:35,611 --> 01:15:38,603
My daughter-in-law is like the
moon. I am proud of my Raju's...

414
01:15:38,681 --> 01:15:45,917
...choice. Even I could'nt have got
such a modest beauty for him.

415
01:15:45,955 --> 01:16:00,950
Sit down. I had made these two
bangles for Raju's bride. Take it.

416
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:06,945
"Let me put it on your hands
myself-Why these tears, mother?"

417
01:16:13,983 --> 01:16:17,055
Sometimes God gives sorrow
alongwith happiness.

418
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:27,108
"What is it? - How do I tell you,
as it concerns Raju's life."

419
01:16:27,029 --> 01:16:34,026
What are you telling? - I have to
tell you the secret which I...

420
01:16:34,103 --> 01:16:41,134
...had hidden in my heart. This is
Raju's horoscope. See it.

421
01:16:41,210 --> 01:16:47,445
What is written? -lf Raju
becomes a father before 25 yrs...

422
01:16:47,650 --> 01:16:54,965
...it is written that it will
result in his death.

423
01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:59,939
I did'nt conduct the marriage till
now as there is some time left...

424
01:16:59,862 --> 01:17:07,291
"...till he becomes 25 years. -
Mother, telling this matter to me"

425
01:17:07,303 --> 01:17:15,495
"I knew, you would'nt believe
such things. But what do I do."

426
01:17:15,711 --> 01:17:25,268
"I am a mother, and beg to you
for Raju's life. Please for..."

427
01:17:25,254 --> 01:17:29,884
"...God's sake, don't let this
disaster to happen"

428
01:17:34,196 --> 01:17:39,031
"Listen, it is only a matter of
some days. I beg at your feet"

429
01:17:44,506 --> 01:17:48,624
"Mother, whatever you tell,
that will be done."

430
01:17:53,916 --> 01:17:57,352
But please don't tell about
this to Raju.

431
01:18:25,781 --> 01:18:30,252
"Saru, your love has given a new
light to my life."

432
01:18:30,252 --> 01:18:36,487
We will start the first night of
our life with these bright stars.

433
01:18:39,762 --> 01:18:45,394
So your life is full of happiness
and has no place for darkness.

434
01:19:03,318 --> 01:19:07,596
"No, Raju- Why not?
- As I am telling you"

435
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:13,183
"Your Raju will not hear "no"
"today. Come near me."

436
01:19:26,842 --> 01:19:30,596
I am refusing & you don't listen.
Stay away & don't touch me.

437
01:19:30,546 --> 01:19:38,385
"What are you telling, have
I done some mistake, Saru?"

438
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:46,512
"Please leave me alone, Raju.
- Alone and that too tonight!"

439
01:19:46,562 --> 01:19:50,032
But why! -I don't have the
answer for that.

440
01:19:50,032 --> 01:19:54,310
"If you don't want to go, I will
only go away-No, Saru"

441
01:19:54,336 --> 01:19:59,251
"You don't have to leave this
room, I will only go away."

442
01:20:01,643 --> 01:20:08,435
"I don't know, for what you are
punishing me, but I assure you..."

443
01:20:08,383 --> 01:20:13,582
...that I will never come near you
to claim my husbandly rights.

444
01:20:31,974 --> 01:20:34,772
"Great sister, this Totharam is
nothing before your plans."

445
01:20:34,877 --> 01:20:42,636
You should be in Delhi. By
spreading Raju's fear of death...

446
01:20:42,584 --> 01:20:46,702
...you misled her so much that
she herself spoiled her first...

447
01:20:46,922 --> 01:20:52,076
...night of marriage. You kindle
this fire so much that she...

448
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:57,671
...leaves this house in four days.
Our work is over and let us...

449
01:20:57,633 --> 01:21:00,545
...go and sleep peacefully now.

450
01:21:19,988 --> 01:21:25,426
What a mother-in-law? My
henna's colour has not faded...

451
01:21:25,427 --> 01:21:28,703
...even now. But you started
showing your colours.

452
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:37,729
"But remember one thing, put all
the oil you have in the fire."

453
01:21:37,639 --> 01:21:43,748
"If I don't teach you a lesson,
I am not my father's daughter"

454
01:21:45,411 --> 01:21:52,442
I will not spare you today
- What is it? You are very...

455
01:21:52,518 --> 01:21:57,717
...happy today. -Today's climate
is only very romantic

456
01:21:57,756 --> 01:22:06,471
"Are you mad? - No, but I want
a flower to bloom in our house."

457
01:22:06,432 --> 01:22:10,664
So many flowers are there here.
- I am not talking about those...

458
01:22:10,703 --> 01:22:19,532
...but one will bloom inside you.
- Could'nt do anything in youth

459
01:22:19,478 --> 01:22:22,754
"Now, in this age, you will make
a flower bloom- What!"

460
01:22:25,884 --> 01:22:29,923
You keep coming & laughing
- I am only bringing vegetables.

461
01:22:29,822 --> 01:22:32,382
Go and make food for me
- I am going

462
01:22:45,471 --> 01:22:51,740
"You had asked for vegetables,
see these! Are you listening?"

463
01:22:51,777 --> 01:23:00,890
"You look annoyed today-What
else to do, yesterday was..."

464
01:23:00,953 --> 01:23:08,541
...Raju brother's first night. But
he was sleeping at the backyard

465
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:19,100
"His fate is only bad, mother was
a demoness but the wife is..."

466
01:23:19,304 --> 01:23:25,493
...also like that only.
- The queen has come.

467
01:23:31,483 --> 01:23:38,002
"Pandu, what are you making
- Vegetables- I will make"

468
01:23:43,028 --> 01:23:44,859
Why are you talking like that?
- I cannot respect a woman...

469
01:23:44,797 --> 01:23:49,791
...who has no respect for her
husband-But what did I do?

470
01:23:49,868 --> 01:23:54,896
Why was Raju sleeping in the
backyard on his first night?

471
01:23:54,807 --> 01:24:00,439
"If you thought he is not suitable
for you, why did you marry him?"

472
01:24:00,412 --> 01:24:11,084
"Who said that, I am only not
fit for him- But what I heard!"

473
01:24:11,056 --> 01:24:17,404
Those were lies. This family's
elders want to separate me and...

474
01:24:17,429 --> 01:24:22,457
...Raju for their selfishness
and want to break our marriage

475
01:24:22,534 --> 01:24:30,088
But I will not allow their wishes
to be filled. Won't I respect I...

476
01:24:30,075 --> 01:24:34,034
...person who saved my prestige
and my father's in front of the...

477
01:24:33,946 --> 01:24:37,939
"...whose village, will I not give
him respect. Think about it."

478
01:24:37,850 --> 01:24:45,882
"You don't know how much I love
him- Sorry, I misunderstood you."

479
01:24:53,398 --> 01:24:59,030
"Pandu, bring food, I am dying of
hunger-Then die, I am coming"

480
01:24:59,004 --> 01:25:05,113
"Stomach or what, never gets
filled up. First go and give..."

481
01:25:05,010 --> 01:25:08,082
"...food to Babuji, then we can
feed these street dwellers."

482
01:25:11,984 --> 01:25:16,853
"This dry food for Babuji- What
to do, those people!"

483
01:25:19,992 --> 01:25:23,985
"Don't worry about them, I will
take food for Babuji from today."

484
01:25:35,974 --> 01:25:48,011
Babuji! - Daughter-in-law-How
can the owner stay hungry...

485
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:54,075
...when everybody else is eating
nicely. I did'nt like it.

486
01:26:17,816 --> 01:26:25,894
You are crying-I was thirsty for
affection for the last 20 years

487
01:26:28,594 --> 01:26:35,272
I was only hungry for this pity
- Why is this injustice happening...

488
01:26:35,234 --> 01:26:38,749
...in this house for so many
years. Why nobody is stopping it

489
01:26:38,737 --> 01:26:45,085
"I tried to stop it alone, but my
wife with her brother proved..."

490
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:50,901
...me mad and left me to
die in this hell.

491
01:26:56,521 --> 01:27:01,276
"I wanted to bring a mother for
my Raju, but a snake came"

492
01:27:01,226 --> 01:27:06,095
She did'nt allow Raju to study
and made him an ignorant.

493
01:27:06,031 --> 01:27:10,980
So that she can take advantage
of him. My Raju thinks of her...

494
01:27:10,903 --> 01:27:17,138
...as a goddess and prays her.
Before that snake engulfs him...

495
01:27:17,175 --> 01:27:21,327
"...please save my Raju,
daughter-in-law."

496
01:27:29,788 --> 01:27:33,098
"Gauri, Rani, work carefully.
- Where do I keep this?"

497
01:27:33,125 --> 01:27:37,277
Put it on my head -lf this year's
yield is not good...

498
01:27:51,176 --> 01:27:55,135
"Why are you so upset today?
- Looks, he did'nt sleep yesterday"

499
01:27:55,047 --> 01:27:59,040
Stop talking & do your work
- That is what we are doing

500
01:27:58,951 --> 01:28:02,068
Your bride has come brother

501
01:28:08,193 --> 01:28:10,661
What magic you did in the night
that she does'nt leave you in...

502
01:28:10,662 --> 01:28:15,816
...day also
- Why did you come here?

503
01:28:15,867 --> 01:28:21,863
I had to talk to you- Come
and talk in that hut.

504
01:28:26,178 --> 01:28:27,213
Taking her to the hut.

505
01:28:27,279 --> 01:28:36,677
"I want to tell you- I know, you
want to say, I am not suitable..."

506
01:28:36,688 --> 01:28:41,842
...for you. - Listen to me
- I have heard in the fair only

507
01:28:41,727 --> 01:28:45,720
That is you will marry only a
prince not a monkey like me

508
01:28:45,797 --> 01:28:50,791
"Suru, I am your husband, did I
try to force myself on you."

509
01:28:50,869 --> 01:28:55,021
Why you did'nt do it?
- What are you doing?

510
01:28:55,073 --> 01:28:59,351
Marriage is the union of two
souls-Then let us unite.

511
01:29:03,415 --> 01:29:06,805
You think I will melt by your
behaviour. I will die but will...

512
01:29:06,818 --> 01:29:11,812
"...not let you near you-
Please accept me, Raju"

513
01:29:15,293 --> 01:29:19,411
Don't compel me to become a
Menaka-I am not Vishwamitra...

514
01:29:19,297 --> 01:29:30,208
...to get melted by your words.
- Is that so- Yes.

515
01:29:30,142 --> 01:29:36,980
You think something will happen
to me by your actions

516
01:29:42,287 --> 01:29:44,847
Any effect- No!

517
01:30:45,083 --> 01:30:51,875
"Gauri, I am going home-Why
- I am remembering him"

518
01:32:00,325 --> 01:32:04,477
What was the secret thing that
happened with your beloved...

519
01:32:04,529 --> 01:32:07,089
"...tell us, our friend."

520
01:32:15,507 --> 01:32:22,265
My ears are looking down
and I am feeling shy...

521
01:32:30,555 --> 01:32:35,185
...how can I tell my
secret message.

522
01:33:20,038 --> 01:33:23,075
"Take oath on us, don't hide
anything from us"

523
01:33:23,141 --> 01:33:28,169
"Tell us, how the flowers from
your hair fell down."

524
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:43,610
"A bee sat on my hair,
I was trying to drive it away"

525
01:33:43,595 --> 01:33:49,625
The flowers were
delicate. -ls it?

526
01:33:49,701 --> 01:33:57,255
Hence kept on falling
from the strings.

527
01:34:28,173 --> 01:34:31,404
The signs of the teeth
which can be seen on you...

528
01:34:31,443 --> 01:34:36,437
"...tell us friend, how
they came about."

529
01:34:43,688 --> 01:34:47,203
I got a parrot
in the night.

530
01:34:47,192 --> 01:34:52,266
Seeing it my mind
was blooming

531
01:34:52,330 --> 01:34:57,768
I kept on fondling
the beautiful parrot

532
01:35:06,578 --> 01:35:10,696
It bit me and
then flew away.

533
01:35:39,611 --> 01:35:42,683
Your entangled hair
is asking you...

534
01:35:42,747 --> 01:35:47,582
...how your blouse
has got wrinkles.

535
01:35:47,519 --> 01:35:51,478
Tell us friend!

536
01:35:54,359 --> 01:35:58,398
My troubled heart started
remembering an unknown

537
01:35:58,296 --> 01:36:03,290
And I started
feeling restless

538
01:36:03,368 --> 01:36:07,486
When I could not
my painful longing...

539
01:36:07,539 --> 01:36:13,535
...I started pressing my heart
with my own hands.

540
01:36:38,837 --> 01:36:41,909
What is this suspense
on this Ghagra?

541
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:46,577
And why are you wearing
it on the reverse side.

542
01:36:46,578 --> 01:36:49,775
Tell us

543
01:36:59,791 --> 01:37:03,864
"You are caught now.
Yes, you are caught."

544
01:37:14,706 --> 01:37:16,901
All of you come here.

545
01:37:16,941 --> 01:37:21,219
I will tell you everything.

546
01:37:29,554 --> 01:37:33,706
I will not hide any
secret from you.

547
01:37:33,758 --> 01:37:39,230
Whatever Maina tells
a parrot secretly.

548
01:37:39,230 --> 01:37:47,023
Whatever happens
after the lights are off

549
01:37:46,971 --> 01:37:54,810
The pain that is
told to the sky.

550
01:37:54,746 --> 01:38:02,016
Whatever a bee
tells a flower

551
01:38:02,220 --> 01:38:09,092
We also did the
same thing.

552
01:38:09,193 --> 01:38:14,790
Listen all of you

553
01:38:42,894 --> 01:38:48,014
"See mother, Ramesh has become
a doctor and has brought..."

554
01:38:48,232 --> 01:38:52,225
...so many degrees from the city.
Now your dream has been...

555
01:38:52,303 --> 01:38:55,978
"...fulfilled, mother. Are
you happy? -Yes, very much"

556
01:38:55,940 --> 01:38:58,579
Now our Ramesh has become
a doctor.

557
01:38:58,543 --> 01:39:02,616
Ramesh has finished his studies.
See a good girl and conduct...

558
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:06,958
"...his marriage now-Shall we
look for a girl, or you have one"

559
01:39:08,886 --> 01:39:13,038
"Mother, that is... - Tell us who
the girl is, her family..."

560
01:39:12,924 --> 01:39:17,793
...and what is she doing?
- She is Konika and she...

561
01:39:17,729 --> 01:39:22,928
...belongs to very big family.
But there is a small problem.

562
01:39:25,370 --> 01:39:32,003
"She is a modern girl, and wants
our marriage in the Court."

563
01:39:31,976 --> 01:39:36,049
"Court or Assembly, we are
concerned with daughter-in-law"

564
01:39:35,947 --> 01:39:39,098
Raju is telling correctly-You got
Mother's permission now

565
01:39:39,317 --> 01:39:40,989
You prepare for bringing your
bride now.

566
01:39:48,893 --> 01:39:52,886
Come- What is this noise? -
These are crackers to welcome U

567
01:39:56,367 --> 01:40:01,839
"Ramesh, you have brought the
bride. Champa, bring "Aarti"

568
01:40:01,839 --> 01:40:04,990
"No, I don't believe in these old
traditions. I have to go inside..."

569
01:40:05,043 --> 01:40:08,877
"...& take bath in cold water
- Yes, let us go"

570
01:40:17,789 --> 01:40:26,902
"She is a modern girl. - Pandey,
what do you think of this girl"

571
01:40:26,798 --> 01:40:30,586
I feel she is quite a
bad woman

572
01:40:33,504 --> 01:40:38,214
"Such a long journey, my
whole body is paining."

573
01:40:42,980 --> 01:40:45,972
"If you are tired, shall
I press your legs-Yes"

574
01:40:51,155 --> 01:40:56,548
"Tea, brother Ramesh.
I did'nt see anything."

575
01:41:00,364 --> 01:41:03,162
It is 40 years since this country
got freedom. Still the...

576
01:41:03,101 --> 01:41:06,650
...husbands here are
servants of their wives.

577
01:41:06,637 --> 01:41:11,665
Is that right? -You stop your
nonsense and give the tea. -Yes

578
01:41:17,181 --> 01:41:23,017
"How bad is this tea? -Madam,
people from the village come..."

579
01:41:22,954 --> 01:41:26,742
...just to drink the tea I make.
You don't call it bad.

580
01:41:26,691 --> 01:41:28,761
The taste in your mouth is only
bad. Check it up with your...

581
01:41:28,826 --> 01:41:31,818
...husband who is a doctor.
Is'nt it? -Bloody servant

582
01:41:34,632 --> 01:41:38,068
She is calling you-I am telling
you valueless servant

583
01:41:38,069 --> 01:41:47,865
"See madam, my name is not
servant but Pandav Bhikaji Rao"

584
01:41:47,812 --> 01:41:52,840
"Talking back, you donkey. -
Whoever is kicking is calling"

585
01:41:52,917 --> 01:41:58,037
"...me a donkey- Ramesh, Pandav,
what is happening?"

586
01:41:57,922 --> 01:42:01,198
"See, this servant is...
- My name is not servant"

587
01:42:01,225 --> 01:42:05,776
"Don't talk like this with the
owner, go from here."

588
01:42:08,099 --> 01:42:09,657
"Konika, did you take father's
blessings-No, who will go..."

589
01:42:09,634 --> 01:42:13,786
...to that mad man's room.
What if breaks my head?

590
01:42:13,838 --> 01:42:16,557
"Konika, don't you feel ashamed
to talk like this about your..."

591
01:42:16,507 --> 01:42:20,546
"...father-in-law? -No, everybody
knows he is a mad man."

592
01:42:20,611 --> 01:42:28,803
"Do you know, what you are
saying-She is telling the truth"

593
01:42:34,926 --> 01:42:36,120
Came to advise us like
a grandmother!

594
01:42:59,050 --> 01:43:17,004
Come father
- Why did you stop?

595
01:43:20,504 --> 01:43:23,143
"Those people... - Nothing
will happen, come with me"

596
01:44:00,611 --> 01:44:06,243
"My own family left me to die in
hell, but though an outsider..."

597
01:44:06,217 --> 01:44:10,972
...you gave me freedom.
You should live long.

598
01:44:10,922 --> 01:44:17,919
"Let us go to the temple, father
- What are you doing?"

599
01:44:17,828 --> 01:44:23,937
It is dangerous to free this mad
man as he is like a wild animal.

600
01:44:24,001 --> 01:44:29,792
"In this house, wolf is free
but the cow is tied & kept."

601
01:44:38,816 --> 01:44:40,966
"See Madam, even I know to
abuse in English."

602
01:44:40,851 --> 01:44:43,923
But I belong to a country
where daughter-in-laws come...

603
01:44:43,821 --> 01:44:47,018
...with a covered cloth in front
of their father-in-law and...

604
01:44:47,058 --> 01:44:53,736
...do not roam half-dressed like
this. Take this towel to cover

605
01:44:59,971 --> 01:45:01,006
You can't take him out.

606
01:45:10,414 --> 01:45:14,453
Keep your delicate hands under
control. If you cross the limits...

607
01:45:14,352 --> 01:45:18,743
...I will break it and give
it in your husband's hands.

608
01:45:18,756 --> 01:45:26,265
"Let us go, father- That is why
I told you not to irritate."

609
01:45:49,186 --> 01:45:53,225
You did'nt do right by taking him
out of his room.

610
01:45:53,124 --> 01:45:58,244
I know what is right & what is
wrong. But you don't know.

611
01:45:58,129 --> 01:46:03,920
Do I have to learn this from you
now? - Yes.

612
01:46:03,868 --> 01:46:09,067
When the elders in the house go
in the wrong path out of their...

613
01:46:09,106 --> 01:46:13,099
"...selfishness, then the younger
ones have to teach them the..."

614
01:46:13,010 --> 01:46:15,126
...right path. - Daughter-in-law!
- Don't shout!

615
01:46:15,012 --> 01:46:20,086
Husband is like God. You have
treated him like an animal.

616
01:46:20,151 --> 01:46:27,023
You don't deserve to be called
human- Then are we animals!

617
01:46:29,293 --> 01:46:35,812
"Be thankful, my son Raju did not
hear, what you told about me."

618
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:39,952
I want him to learn how selfish
and greedy his mother is.

619
01:46:39,837 --> 01:46:44,592
"Suru, another word about my
mother will not be for your good"

620
01:46:44,708 --> 01:46:47,302
"Raju, you don't know how bad
your mother is? She did not..."

621
01:46:47,278 --> 01:46:51,396
...allow you to study so that she
can take advantage of you.

622
01:46:53,717 --> 01:46:57,346
"Your mother does'nt love you at
all, she loves only your property."

623
01:46:57,321 --> 01:47:03,351
The mother you worship is not a
goddess but a demoness.

624
01:47:08,032 --> 01:47:13,504
What did you say? I will kill you
today for calling her a demones...

625
01:47:19,143 --> 01:47:31,374
"Raju, I tell you to leave her.
- Saw how good my mother is"

626
01:47:31,422 --> 01:47:36,371
"You abused her so much, but she
only saved you from me today."

627
01:47:36,293 --> 01:47:43,324
"But if you want to live in this
house, you fall at my mother's..."

628
01:47:43,234 --> 01:47:49,423
...feet and ask for forgivance
now only. Or there is no place...

629
01:47:49,473 --> 01:47:54,547
...for you in this house- I also
don't want to stay in a place...

630
01:47:54,445 --> 01:47:57,437
...where one is punished for
telling the truth.

631
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:06,212
Saw this lady who does not
respect her husband also.

632
01:49:24,301 --> 01:49:28,340
"From the time I have come to
this house, only I rule here."

633
01:49:28,405 --> 01:49:34,401
Nobody has been able to change
it. What are you?

634
01:49:34,311 --> 01:49:42,264
"My advice is, don't open your
mouth except for eating here."

635
01:49:42,186 --> 01:49:47,306
Or your life will be worse
than hell here.

636
01:49:47,358 --> 01:49:54,594
I also take oath that I won't sit
at peace without removing all...

637
01:49:54,632 --> 01:49:58,022
...the injustice going on in this
house.

638
01:50:13,484 --> 01:50:26,682
"Raju, I hurt your mind.
Please forgive me."

639
01:50:26,730 --> 01:50:31,440
"I should ask for forgivance,
as I behaved like an animal."

640
01:50:31,402 --> 01:50:38,513
"But what should I do, whenever
anybody abuses my mother..."

641
01:50:38,409 --> 01:50:46,521
"...I lose control of myself. You
can abuse me a lot, but please..."

642
01:50:46,417 --> 01:50:50,456
...don't talk badly about my
mother. I request you that.

643
01:50:54,024 --> 01:51:02,136
What has happened? -I punished
myself for beating you.

644
01:51:12,776 --> 01:51:17,088
"Forgive me, Raju, I did'nt know
you love me so much."

645
01:51:17,114 --> 01:51:19,833
I will never leave you and go

646
01:51:56,186 --> 01:52:04,378
My beloved! My beloved!

647
01:52:13,370 --> 01:52:18,763
I am yours and you are mine
how does the world matter?

648
01:52:26,550 --> 01:52:30,862
Now I only want to give
all the happiness in life

649
01:52:42,065 --> 01:52:49,983
My dear! My dear!

650
01:52:59,616 --> 01:53:05,532
I am yours and you are mine
how does the world matter?

651
01:53:13,096 --> 01:53:17,612
Now I only want to give
all the happiness in life

652
01:53:56,707 --> 01:54:01,861
I will fulfil all the traditions
of our marriage

653
01:54:14,925 --> 01:54:20,602
And will complete all
the oaths taken

654
01:54:20,564 --> 01:54:26,560
I will also fulfil all
the promises.

655
01:54:26,637 --> 01:54:31,950
I will never give you
any sorrow now.

656
01:54:31,975 --> 01:54:38,687
Whatever you tell
only matters to me.

657
01:54:38,649 --> 01:54:41,721
How does the world
matter to us?

658
01:55:23,527 --> 01:55:28,362
"In times of happiness as well as
sorrow, I will not leave you"

659
01:55:41,445 --> 01:55:46,565
"Now that I have caught your
hand, I will never leave it."

660
01:55:46,450 --> 01:55:52,719
It is my good fortune
that I have got you.

661
01:55:52,756 --> 01:55:58,672
God has made me just
for you.

662
01:55:58,595 --> 01:56:02,554
You are in my heart
as well as my life

663
01:56:02,466 --> 01:56:04,696
Now where will I be with you?

664
01:56:04,735 --> 01:56:08,569
Why should we take
from the world now?

665
01:56:28,525 --> 01:56:31,915
"Teeth is already broken, now
my hip will also break."

666
01:56:31,928 --> 01:56:35,398
Here is your material. Give me
my money now.

667
01:56:35,399 --> 01:56:41,918
"Here, take this Rs. 2 lakhs.
- Shall I write it in the book."

668
01:56:41,905 --> 01:56:46,057
"Write that, due to fire in the
godown, 2 lakhs were lost."

669
01:56:46,109 --> 01:56:49,818
But Totaramji- Now you will tell
me there was fire in the fields...

670
01:56:49,780 --> 01:56:53,568
"...last money, & before that
pumps burnt & all."

671
01:56:53,517 --> 01:56:55,633
But this month also only fire!

672
01:57:16,139 --> 01:57:21,293
"Pandu, my husband slogs day &
night & you all don't care."

673
01:57:21,344 --> 01:57:28,932
How much loss has come to us?
- You are slapping our Pandu.

674
01:57:28,919 --> 01:57:33,709
"Ask him, how there was fire
in your fields, well & godown."

675
01:57:33,657 --> 01:57:37,172
"But for the last two years, there
has been no fire in the village"

676
01:57:37,160 --> 01:57:41,153
"I am not telling this, but
these account books state that"

677
01:57:41,398 --> 01:57:43,707
"It says that due to fire,
lakhs of money have been lost"

678
01:57:43,734 --> 01:57:47,886
Who writes the accounts?
- Accountant!

679
01:57:47,938 --> 01:57:56,937
Tell what my stars tell for me
this week-Bad time starts now

680
01:58:01,918 --> 01:58:03,749
"Accountant, what is written
in this account book."

681
01:58:03,687 --> 01:58:08,602
Read what is written quickly

682
01:58:10,660 --> 01:58:13,777
"Due to fire in the godown,
there is a loss of 2 lakhs."

683
01:58:13,830 --> 01:58:19,939
Your glasses need to be changed.
2 lakhs profit is written here...

684
01:58:20,003 --> 01:58:24,042
"...and you are telling that there
is a loss, fool."

685
01:58:23,940 --> 01:58:29,139
"Uncle, don't try to be clever, my
educated wife told me everything."

686
01:58:29,179 --> 01:58:40,852
"You won't tell me like this.
Pandu, where is my stick."

687
01:58:40,824 --> 01:58:45,852
Take this gun. Real bullets
are there inside.

688
01:58:50,867 --> 01:58:55,941
"Now tell me, who has stolen
the money by wrong accounting."

689
01:58:56,006 --> 01:59:01,126
"Sir, I did'nt steal anything.
Totharamji did this."

690
01:59:03,513 --> 01:59:10,032
"Leave me-Don't try to run away,
uncle, or I will shoot you."

691
01:59:10,020 --> 01:59:17,096
"I am your only uncle- Now tell
me, where is the stolen money."

692
01:59:17,160 --> 01:59:23,110
"What is all this? - Save me,
I am getting big punishment for..."

693
01:59:23,033 --> 01:59:27,629
"...my small mistake-Mother, I had
given all responsibility of..."

694
01:59:27,604 --> 01:59:32,200
...accounting to your brother.
But he has stolen lakhs from us

695
01:59:32,175 --> 01:59:36,851
"I have reformed myself,
please forgive me."

696
01:59:36,813 --> 01:59:45,767
"Leave it son & forgive him.
- Please forgive me- Ok, mother"

697
01:59:48,291 --> 01:59:50,725
What are you speaking? It was
forgivable if he had only...

698
01:59:50,727 --> 01:59:54,356
...cheated you but he cheated
your goddess like mother.

699
01:59:54,497 --> 01:59:58,695
"How can we forgive him?
- Mother, you are very innocent"

700
01:59:58,735 --> 02:00:02,410
"So, they are cheating you, we
should'nt forgive people like him"

701
02:00:02,539 --> 02:00:07,294
"Tell uncle, where is the money?
Or I will shoot you."

702
02:00:09,613 --> 02:00:14,243
Snake! Snake!
- I won't let you take the bed

703
02:00:14,217 --> 02:00:21,055
"I can't let you take the bed, as
snake is inside it-What is this?"

704
02:00:20,991 --> 02:00:24,620
A snake is inside this bedding
- He is thinking a rope to be...

705
02:00:24,594 --> 02:00:29,031
...a snake-lf you don't find snake
send me to mental hospital today

706
02:00:29,032 --> 02:00:34,186
"Let the mad man speak
- Pandu, bring the bed outside"

707
02:00:42,012 --> 02:00:45,721
"Raju, I agree there is a snake,
but it is brought up by me for..."

708
02:00:45,682 --> 02:00:53,919
...the last fifteen years
- Get up uncle

709
02:00:53,957 --> 02:01:02,149
You don't believe me and insulted
my snake god. I can't stay here

710
02:01:02,198 --> 02:01:09,149
I am going with my snake god
to some far off place. Come

711
02:01:11,074 --> 02:01:17,832
Wait-Pandu! -Leave your bed
or I will shoot you.

712
02:01:38,835 --> 02:01:41,827
"I never thought you can do
such low behaviour,"

713
02:01:46,042 --> 02:01:51,196
Your punishment is you will one
among the other servants.

714
02:01:55,051 --> 02:01:57,929
"Yes, I will work in fields,
but my wife is also a part..."

715
02:01:57,854 --> 02:02:06,091
"...of this cheating. She should
also work- Yes, she will do."

716
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:13,155
I have kept all the money in this
box- Give this to mother.

717
02:02:18,041 --> 02:02:22,239
"Wait! Do you have any sense,
you are putting mother's life..."

718
02:02:22,278 --> 02:02:26,749
...in danger by giving this money.
- But how?

719
02:02:26,750 --> 02:02:30,459
"You are very innocent. If some
day, cheat uncle puts stone on..."

720
02:02:30,420 --> 02:02:35,972
"...mother's head and runs
away with the money, then."

721
02:02:38,461 --> 02:02:43,091
"You are right! - Father, give this
to Suru- To me!"

722
02:02:43,066 --> 02:02:49,460
"Yes, you only take care of this!
- Ok, as you wish."

723
02:02:53,109 --> 02:02:59,264
I will take this risk for you. I
can do anything for mother.

724
02:03:14,264 --> 02:03:17,097
"Congratulations, have to
appreciate your game."

725
02:03:17,033 --> 02:03:21,390
I have learnt from you only

726
02:03:24,841 --> 02:03:34,989
"Remember, I am the old master in
this game & noone can beat me"

727
02:03:34,884 --> 02:03:44,156
Till now you were playing with
weaklings & so won the game.

728
02:03:44,194 --> 02:03:48,426
You have no idea about the
danger of game you're playing

729
02:03:48,465 --> 02:03:53,061
"Without danger, there is no
fun in playing. And one does'nt..."

730
02:03:53,036 --> 02:03:57,029
...get the chance to play with a
master like you every day.

731
02:03:59,542 --> 02:04:05,174
Fond of playing! I challenge you
that you will only come & give...

732
02:04:05,148 --> 02:04:10,905
...these two lakhs to me before
12 o' clock tomorrow.

733
02:04:28,872 --> 02:04:30,863
"Whose telegram, daughter? - 
Ramesh has been expelled from..."

734
02:04:30,940 --> 02:04:34,091
...the college. But how is he
a doctor now?

735
02:04:34,010 --> 02:04:38,128
"What are you doing, don't leave
the house and listen to me?"

736
02:04:40,216 --> 02:04:43,970
"Never, my dad is not a beggar
like you. If I go there..."

737
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:46,992
...he will do anything for
my husband.

738
02:04:47,257 --> 02:04:50,374
It is a matter of prestige of this
house. I beg to you.

739
02:04:50,260 --> 02:04:54,970
"Mother, what is this? - I will
tell you. My husband is a doctor"

740
02:04:54,931 --> 02:04:59,561
"For establishing a hospital in
town, I asked for Rs. 6 lakhs..."

741
02:04:59,536 --> 02:05:02,289
...from your mother. You know
what she said.

742
02:05:02,238 --> 02:05:07,631
She says it is your money and
can't be given to anyone.

743
02:05:07,810 --> 02:05:14,079
All property belongs to my
brother. I am only a step brother

744
02:05:14,117 --> 02:05:17,507
What are you saying? Mother
must have just told something.

745
02:05:20,957 --> 02:05:24,074
"Tell me, how much money you
want for making a hospital."

746
02:05:23,960 --> 02:05:32,038
"Six lakh rupees- Suru, bring the
money I gave you yesterday."

747
02:05:36,239 --> 02:05:39,515
"Brother, I will return your money
with interest after hospital runs."

748
02:05:42,178 --> 02:05:44,248
Are you mad to differentiate
between us?

749
02:05:44,147 --> 02:05:46,422
"Whatever is here, belongs
to all of us."

750
02:05:49,385 --> 02:05:54,505
Give this to Ramesh-I want to
take this from mother's hands.

751
02:05:54,390 --> 02:05:59,066
"That is also very good.
- Brother, what is the time?"

752
02:06:15,578 --> 02:06:20,333
"Two seconds left for 12O'clock.
- Give me, daughter-in-law"

753
02:06:25,388 --> 02:06:29,347
If we open a hospital in the
village itself in mother's name...

754
02:06:29,259 --> 02:06:36,609
...respect for her will increase a
lot. - What great idea?

755
02:06:36,633 --> 02:06:41,104
"Hospital in mother's name.
Yes, that will only be done."

756
02:06:43,206 --> 02:06:48,405
"Villagers, we are laying the
foundation for a hospital today."

757
02:06:48,444 --> 02:06:53,438
This good work will be started
by the auspicious hands of my...

758
02:06:53,516 --> 02:06:58,431
...sacred mother-in-law. This
hospital will be named for her

759
02:07:09,565 --> 02:07:12,363
This another garland is for
my brother-in-law whose...

760
02:07:12,302 --> 02:07:15,180
...great hands will be
treating you all.

761
02:07:17,206 --> 02:07:20,198
He has studied hard for five
years & has become a doctor...

762
02:07:20,276 --> 02:07:24,315
...after getting many degrees and
has come to treat you.

763
02:07:28,284 --> 02:07:30,400
I don't like this garland...
- This is the first garland

764
02:07:30,453 --> 02:07:33,411
Lots of garlands are waiting for
you - What do you mean?

765
02:07:33,323 --> 02:07:36,395
"Means, this garland is a sign of
your victory."

766
02:07:39,195 --> 02:07:43,234
See how she is garlanding
him. When I went to the temple...

767
02:07:43,132 --> 02:07:49,526
...they were putting one on a
goat before sacrificing it.

768
02:07:49,539 --> 02:07:53,088
I feel that there is something
wrong. He is also being cut...

769
02:07:59,582 --> 02:08:03,575
"Now hospital is not yet made,
inspector has come for treatment"

770
02:08:13,696 --> 02:08:17,405
I have come for seeing the
medical degrees of your brother.

771
02:08:24,574 --> 02:08:32,492
I will satisfy myself & then go
- You are doubting my brother!

772
02:08:32,415 --> 02:08:37,443
There is no point in making this
issue bigger. You tell Ramesh...

773
02:08:37,353 --> 02:08:39,628
...to show his certificates and
then the inspector will leave.

774
02:08:41,124 --> 02:08:43,638
"You are right, Suru. Ramesh,
show him your certificates."

775
02:08:43,626 --> 02:08:56,300
"Inspector, please come. Don't
make this big, take some money"

776
02:08:59,609 --> 02:09:04,160
"Inspector, is my brother is a
culprit, that U catched his collar"

777
02:09:04,147 --> 02:09:07,583
"Your brother deserves only this
treatment, as he is a liar..."

778
02:09:07,583 --> 02:09:15,536
...and was trying to give me a
bribe. He is not a doctor at all.

779
02:09:21,597 --> 02:09:26,466
How can this be? He got a box
full of degrees when he came.

780
02:09:26,402 --> 02:09:31,192
They were not degrees but waste
paper which are got for Rs. 2-

781
02:09:35,144 --> 02:09:41,538
My brother deceived us so much.
He broke my mother's dream.

782
02:09:41,551 --> 02:09:43,826
I arrest him for the crime of
acting as a doctor.

783
02:09:43,853 --> 02:09:51,533
"Don't do that, my mother can't
show her face to anyone."

784
02:09:53,496 --> 02:09:57,614
I request you not to arrest him
for my mother's sake.

785
02:10:08,711 --> 02:10:15,469
"Today I warn him and leave him.
But next time, I won't spare him"

786
02:10:15,418 --> 02:10:16,931
"Many thanks, Inspector."

787
02:10:29,632 --> 02:10:33,386
"Useless cheat, you deceived
my mother to such an extent."

788
02:10:33,336 --> 02:10:36,567
The whole village is laughing
at her and spitting on her.

789
02:10:36,606 --> 02:10:40,645
You kept deceiving her always
that you are becoming a doctor

790
02:10:42,278 --> 02:10:48,877
"Raju! - Leave it mother, if U also
beat Ramesh, he can't bear it."

791
02:10:48,851 --> 02:10:53,481
"Leave my hand-No mother, leave
your anger and forgive Ramesh"

792
02:10:55,925 --> 02:11:01,716
"From today, I should see you
working in the fields."

793
02:11:01,664 --> 02:11:04,417
Now you go from here.

794
02:11:06,836 --> 02:11:10,306
"Son, what do I do with the
money you gave to Ramesh."

795
02:11:10,306 --> 02:11:15,585
"Give them to Suru
- Daughter, there is a lot..."

796
02:11:15,611 --> 02:11:19,729
...of fun in the game of chess.
Opposite team is losing a lot.

797
02:11:19,615 --> 02:11:21,412
Yes Babuji

798
02:11:36,632 --> 02:11:40,989
"How much will you make us
work, it is evening now."

799
02:11:48,644 --> 02:11:50,600
"Why did you bring me here,
I was better off in town."

800
02:11:50,513 --> 02:11:55,792
I am remembering my mother
- I remember my father.

801
02:11:59,221 --> 02:12:06,775
"Food is ready, all of you come
- Food is written in our fate."

802
02:12:16,973 --> 02:12:22,331
"What about our food? - That
was not yours, this is yours!"

803
02:12:24,914 --> 02:12:29,351
"This chapathi & green chilli,
we can't eat this."

804
02:12:29,352 --> 02:12:34,745
"Don't eat then, I will give this to
Tommy- Tommy!"

805
02:12:40,262 --> 02:12:42,776
This dog is more fortunate than
you. Now you will get food...

806
02:12:42,765 --> 02:12:46,644
...only tomorrow afternoon
- That is after 24 hours.

807
02:12:52,508 --> 02:12:53,782
Let us snatch food
from the dog.

808
02:13:06,956 --> 02:13:10,073
Now they have lost the king
and the minister.

809
02:13:10,292 --> 02:13:13,967
Only the queen is left now.
- Lf she comes to our hands...

810
02:13:21,404 --> 02:13:27,593
"Pandu, where has he gone."

811
02:13:32,515 --> 02:13:36,747
"Leave me- We will not leave you
easily queen, got you after..."

812
02:13:36,786 --> 02:13:45,137
"...great difficulty. Catch her
- Suru, why are you catching..."

813
02:13:45,327 --> 02:13:49,923
"...my mother- Raju! - How
is this blood coming, Mother?"

814
02:13:49,899 --> 02:13:53,858
You should not speak much at
this condition. I will tell you

815
02:13:53,769 --> 02:13:58,718
"When Mother was coming down
the steps, she fell suddenly..."

816
02:13:58,641 --> 02:14:01,474
...out of giddiness. This happens
to people with high B.P.

817
02:14:03,813 --> 02:14:10,844
"This comes to people who have
too much fat. -No, son."

818
02:14:12,421 --> 02:14:15,413
My friend's mother also had the
same disease. Lack of proper...

819
02:14:15,491 --> 02:14:20,167
"...care made her vomit blood,
and she had a terrible death."

820
02:14:22,665 --> 02:14:25,179
"Tell good things, Suru. Mother,
you take rest, your life is..."

821
02:14:25,167 --> 02:14:28,318
...very important to me. I will go
and get the doctor.

822
02:14:29,405 --> 02:14:35,799
"You think, we have not called
the doctor. There he has come."

823
02:14:45,554 --> 02:14:48,705
"Doctor, please tell what has
happened to my mother."

824
02:14:48,758 --> 02:14:52,592
"She is the patient. -
My God, lot of problems!"

825
02:15:01,036 --> 02:15:11,753
You make arrangements for
her funeral. -What do you mean?

826
02:15:15,050 --> 02:15:17,086
She does not need medicines
but needs prayer.

827
02:15:16,986 --> 02:15:25,542
How can you say that without
testing her? -I will test her

828
02:15:31,567 --> 02:15:34,639
"He is my uncle. Doctor, see
what is wrong with my mother"

829
02:15:34,703 --> 02:15:36,614
Time is very short for her

830
02:15:36,539 --> 02:15:38,655
Catch this

831
02:16:18,113 --> 02:16:21,662
How he has made
my condition?

832
02:16:36,065 --> 02:16:40,980
The voltage of her brain is 440
volts. That means she uses her...

833
02:16:40,903 --> 02:16:47,012
...brain a bit too much.
- Is there a treatment!

834
02:16:47,076 --> 02:16:54,107
Give her a juice made from
neem leaves- Yes

835
02:16:58,120 --> 02:17:04,150
"No Raju, I can't drink this, it is
very bitter. - Drink for my sake"

836
02:17:25,281 --> 02:17:30,719
"Doctor, now my mother will live
- To try is my duty."

837
02:17:30,719 --> 02:17:39,388
Now I have to give her this
injection. -But this is very big.

838
02:17:39,361 --> 02:17:46,312
"Yes, its effect is also great.
I gave it to a horse."

839
02:17:46,235 --> 02:17:52,344
"She came first in the race.
- No, I won't take the injection."

840
02:17:52,241 --> 02:17:56,917
"Hold her tight- Mother,
take the injection."

841
02:18:06,322 --> 02:18:12,272
I have done what I could. She
needs rest from today.

842
02:18:12,194 --> 02:18:15,425
Full control of diet and
full bed rest.

843
02:18:15,631 --> 02:18:19,146
"But doctor, she is only managing
the house and the business"

844
02:18:19,134 --> 02:18:22,206
She has to open and close
thousands of keys in a day.

845
02:18:22,271 --> 02:18:26,662
Who will take so many
responsibilities?

846
02:18:26,675 --> 02:18:30,907
What is this daughter-in-law
for? - I am educated.

847
02:18:30,946 --> 02:18:36,179
"I can't do these small works.
- If I give you one slap..."

848
02:18:36,218 --> 02:18:39,927
...all your pride will go.
You have to take the keys.

849
02:18:39,888 --> 02:18:49,206
"But -Mother, give the keys
- She can't handle it, son"

850
02:18:49,231 --> 02:18:54,863
"I will see, how she can't
- Take these keys."

851
02:18:54,837 --> 02:18:57,510
You have the full responsibility
of the house. - No

852
02:18:57,639 --> 02:19:02,155
To take the burden from mother-
in-law's shoulders is the...

853
02:19:02,144 --> 02:19:04,294
...duty of the daughter-in-law.
Take the keys.

854
02:19:04,346 --> 02:19:10,979
"I will accept, if you say so.
- Now the keys are also gone"

855
02:19:14,156 --> 02:19:18,149
"Suru, what happened to you. Who
has put a black eye on our..."

856
02:19:18,060 --> 02:19:20,176
"...family. Doctor, see her...
- What are you doing?"

857
02:19:20,062 --> 02:19:24,817
"I know what has happened to
me-You are laughing, tell me!"

858
02:19:28,237 --> 02:19:33,027
You are going to become a
father! - I am becoming a father

859
02:19:35,477 --> 02:19:38,947
"Yes- Mother, you are going to
become a grandmother."

860
02:19:38,947 --> 02:19:45,216
"Father, I am gong to become a
father. Pandu! - Yes master"

861
02:20:01,937 --> 02:20:05,327
He has gone to the fields. I will
go and tell him if you tell me.

862
02:20:05,340 --> 02:20:08,412
Tell him to run and inform my
father-in-law that his...

863
02:20:08,477 --> 02:20:10,945
...son-in-law has done
a great job.

864
02:20:25,227 --> 02:20:26,865
"What has happened to her,
doctor."

865
02:20:33,535 --> 02:20:36,003
Effect of the injection. Will
become ok after 2 hrs.

866
02:20:42,411 --> 02:20:45,926
What happened? - The motor
and fuel pump are not working

867
02:20:45,914 --> 02:20:50,590
"Then how will the work get
over. -Pandu, we will ourselves..."

868
02:20:50,552 --> 02:20:52,782
...go to the city and hire the
tractors.

869
02:20:52,821 --> 02:20:56,609
"Champa, go and tell in the house
that we will come tomorrow"

870
02:21:02,431 --> 02:21:06,504
"Ok sister, we will leave,
as we are getting late."

871
02:21:06,401 --> 02:21:11,475
I got all the things for all of
you. And this Kesar for Saru.

872
02:21:11,373 --> 02:21:16,606
"What is that for? -lf this is
drunk with milk, then the child..."

873
02:21:16,812 --> 02:21:22,728
...will born fair & healthy. Tell
her to have this with milk daily

874
02:21:34,363 --> 02:21:36,479
"After a long time, we have got
pure ghee sweets."

875
02:21:39,535 --> 02:21:44,211
"Wait patiently, brother- If Saru
comes, we won't get this to eat"

876
02:21:47,209 --> 02:21:55,321
"First listen to me. Ramesh take
this key, and take out the..."

877
02:21:55,384 --> 02:22:01,983
"...poison from the shelf. - Maina,
why is she asking for poison."

878
02:22:01,957 --> 02:22:04,596
Do you want all of us to eat
poison and die.

879
02:22:06,495 --> 02:22:11,649
You asked me about my last
play. This is it.

880
02:22:11,533 --> 02:22:18,291
"I don't understand. - All limits
are crossed. In this house..."

881
02:22:18,240 --> 02:22:23,394
"...either she will live, or me.
- Yes, when you have put..."

882
02:22:23,445 --> 02:22:27,438
"...your foot forward, don't back
out. Our life lies in her death."

883
02:22:27,516 --> 02:22:28,631
"Take this, mother."

884
02:22:44,299 --> 02:22:48,372
Wants to fight with me. She
does'nt know I am a snake...

885
02:22:48,437 --> 02:22:57,516
...who can eat her own child.
Then how will I leave you...

886
02:22:57,412 --> 02:22:59,323
...and your child.

887
02:23:11,260 --> 02:23:17,051
Saru does'nt have a mother. So
we have to take care of her.

888
02:23:16,999 --> 02:23:23,393
Her father came and gave this
kesar. Give this to her.

889
02:23:23,405 --> 02:23:27,284
What will happen with this?
- Child will be born fair and...

890
02:23:27,209 --> 02:23:31,122
...healthy- Then I will definitely
give it to her.

891
02:23:39,588 --> 02:23:44,343
What are you doing in this
condition. Get down.

892
02:23:49,965 --> 02:23:52,604
Why have you put such a big
photo of mine?

893
02:23:52,567 --> 02:23:55,559
"Secret, first take me into your
arms."

894
02:23:59,975 --> 02:24:03,092
"It is said, whoever a pregnant
woman sees a lot during her..."

895
02:24:03,145 --> 02:24:06,694
"...pregnancy period, her child's
face also will be like that."

896
02:24:08,417 --> 02:24:11,614
"That is why, I have put
your photo there."

897
02:24:11,653 --> 02:24:15,726
So that your face always stays
in front of me.

898
02:24:15,624 --> 02:24:20,539
And a small Raju is born
after some days.

899
02:24:20,462 --> 02:24:25,695
Then you put your photo there
- Why

900
02:24:25,734 --> 02:24:30,364
"First a girl will be born
- No, a boy will be born"

901
02:24:31,440 --> 02:24:32,793
I am telling you a girl will
be born

902
02:24:41,083 --> 02:24:44,075
"This kesar was given by your
father. He told that, if this..."

903
02:24:44,152 --> 02:24:49,431
"...is taken with milk, child will
be fair, beautiful and healthy."

904
02:24:49,458 --> 02:24:53,610
"Before the milk gets cold,
drink it quickly."

905
02:24:56,031 --> 02:25:01,151
"Wait, let me mix more Kesar
in this, so the child is more fair"

906
02:25:01,203 --> 02:25:04,832
"This kesar is for one month,
will you finish it in a day."

907
02:25:04,806 --> 02:25:07,798
"If it is over, more will come.
You have it quickly."

908
02:25:07,709 --> 02:25:10,701
Give it with your hands.

909
02:25:29,731 --> 02:25:33,360
"I am drinking milk from your
hands, I will pray & come."

910
02:25:37,205 --> 02:25:38,923
Why did you stop me from
having milk?

911
02:25:39,040 --> 02:25:47,391
Poison is mixed in that Kesar
sister. - Poison

912
02:25:47,416 --> 02:25:51,329
I saw Raju's mother mixing
poison with my own eyes.

913
02:25:54,156 --> 02:26:02,313
No that is not possible
- I take oath on my husband

914
02:26:10,539 --> 02:26:16,250
"Is your prayer over or not Saru!
Come soon, milk is getting cold."

915
02:26:35,363 --> 02:26:41,359
"Take this-Why this, Saru
- I would prefer to die at..."

916
02:26:41,436 --> 02:26:45,224
"...your hands, instead of drinking
the poison given by others."

917
02:26:45,173 --> 02:26:52,932
"Cut me-The Kesar you mixed in
the milk, had poison in it."

918
02:26:56,518 --> 02:27:01,353
What nonsense. That kesar was
given by your father.

919
02:27:03,658 --> 02:27:08,778
"My father gave only kesar, but
your mother mixed poison in it."

920
02:27:12,901 --> 02:27:21,172
"Don't say like that, your tongue
will get cut."

921
02:27:21,209 --> 02:27:26,237
I am ready to get completely cut
as I knew you won't believe me.

922
02:27:29,217 --> 02:27:33,096
"Don't put such a big blame
on my mother, Saru"

923
02:27:39,961 --> 02:27:43,237
"Before my mother becomes a
murderer, sky will tremble..."

924
02:27:43,265 --> 02:27:48,544
...moon & stars will move away
& earth will move from its place

925
02:27:51,773 --> 02:28:04,322
"You are lying, Suru-lf I am
lying, my child will die inside me"

926
02:28:13,995 --> 02:28:17,544
"If your belief is definite,
my belief is also strong."

927
02:28:17,532 --> 02:28:23,050
Now it has to be proved whether
there is poison in this milk or...

928
02:28:23,204 --> 02:28:28,597
...not. No need to trouble mother
I will prove it by drinking it.

929
02:28:41,856 --> 02:28:44,575
What have you done? I have
become the reason of your death

930
02:28:44,526 --> 02:28:49,122
"If I had known you will drink the
milk, I would have drunk it."

931
02:28:49,264 --> 02:28:51,141
What do I do? Let us go
to the doctor now. Come

932
02:28:54,235 --> 02:28:59,150
Leave me. You go to doctor if
you want. I will stay here only.

933
02:28:59,240 --> 02:29:02,277
Nothing will happen to me.
- Where do I go now?

934
02:29:05,747 --> 02:29:09,103
"You snake, tell that there is
poison in the milk."

935
02:29:09,284 --> 02:29:15,120
"Otherwise my Raju will not live.
Murderer, don't stand quiet."

936
02:29:19,361 --> 02:29:21,921
Don't dare to tell anything bad
about my mother. I'll kill you

937
02:29:25,700 --> 02:29:31,093
"I will go and call the doctor
- See, she doubts you mother."

938
02:29:31,272 --> 02:29:35,106
Let her call the doctor. She will
also realize the truth now.

939
02:29:35,043 --> 02:29:40,481
You have given me more love
than your own son.

940
02:29:40,482 --> 02:29:43,201
And she is trying to provoke
me against such a mother.

941
02:29:43,318 --> 02:29:50,110
She calls you a murderer and
says U mixed poison in the milk

942
02:29:50,058 --> 02:29:55,178
"She does'nt know, poison can
become milk by mother's love"

943
02:30:01,936 --> 02:30:06,088
"My father only gave kesar, but
your mother mixed poison in that"

944
02:30:43,778 --> 02:30:50,536
"Mother, the first word coming
out of a baby's mouth is Ma."

945
02:30:50,485 --> 02:30:55,605
"When he becomes big, he
says a lot of things."

946
02:30:55,657 --> 02:31:01,687
"But I have only said "Mother"
"in my my life"

947
02:31:04,532 --> 02:31:12,689
"If you had just told me that,
you want all my property..."

948
02:31:12,741 --> 02:31:19,931
"...& put your thumb impression
here, I would have cut my..."

949
02:31:19,981 --> 02:31:27,854
"...thumb & given you. For you,
I can cut my head & give you."

950
02:31:32,026 --> 02:31:36,099
"Then why did you do all this,
why mother?"

951
02:31:42,504 --> 02:31:46,258
"Fulfil the last wish of your
son, mother."

952
02:31:51,780 --> 02:31:56,217
Ladies are'nt allowed in the
graveyard. But you should come

953
02:31:56,217 --> 02:32:06,013
"Before my body burns, call me
son with a true heart"

954
02:32:11,566 --> 02:32:13,318
"I don't need anything else,
mother."

955
02:33:11,259 --> 02:33:13,375
"Come quickly, doctor!"

956
02:33:27,642 --> 02:33:30,998
We have locked your husband in
this room.

957
02:33:31,012 --> 02:33:37,281
Good you brought the doctor.
He is in his last stage.

958
02:33:37,318 --> 02:33:44,030
"And we have the key. To open
that, you have do a small..."

959
02:33:43,992 --> 02:33:46,187
...work. You have to sign
in the will

960
02:33:46,227 --> 02:33:52,177
"Rogues, lifelong you squeezed my
Raju and were eating him."

961
02:33:52,100 --> 02:33:56,332
Now you want to take advantage
of his death also.

962
02:33:56,537 --> 02:33:59,449
"You want only property, tell
we where I have to sign."

963
02:34:21,562 --> 02:34:23,792
You will not sign
in these papers.

964
02:34:30,071 --> 02:34:34,110
"Open the door, daughter.
- Have you gone mad, mother?"

965
02:34:36,177 --> 02:34:40,250
Leave me. Even bad people have
morality. They are scared of god.

966
02:34:40,315 --> 02:34:47,630
We have been wicked enough to
take away Raju's life who has...

967
02:34:47,655 --> 02:34:56,131
"...prayed not God, a demoness
like me throughout his life."

968
02:34:56,130 --> 02:35:03,047
"Today if we save him, our sins
might be washed away."

969
02:35:02,971 --> 02:35:11,447
"He might forgive us. But if he
dies, it will be death of a..."

970
02:35:11,612 --> 02:35:17,960
...mother and the sacredness
of motherhood.

971
02:35:17,986 --> 02:35:22,184
"And I will be the murderer,
that is the mother."

972
02:35:22,223 --> 02:35:27,217
"Sister, what is sudden affection
of love. We have waited to..."

973
02:35:27,295 --> 02:35:30,731
"...grab this property for 15
years, will we leave it like this."

974
02:35:30,732 --> 02:35:36,841
Think of your own son.
- Kaikeyi sent Ram only to the...

975
02:35:36,904 --> 02:35:44,902
"...forest for 14 years, but will
I give death to Ram for Bharat."

976
02:35:47,181 --> 02:35:52,858
"Ramesh, if you have little love
for your mother, give the key."

977
02:35:52,820 --> 02:35:57,132
"First give me the will, then
I will give the key."

978
02:36:06,868 --> 02:36:10,224
"Give me the will papers,
otherwise I will..."

979
02:36:13,341 --> 02:36:15,411
You talk like this with
your mother.

980
02:36:31,959 --> 02:36:39,115
"Well done, son, you returned your
mother's milk very nicely."

981
02:36:39,167 --> 02:36:49,122
"Not your mistake, but this is the
punishment of the God which..."

982
02:36:49,043 --> 02:36:55,118
...has come as a slap on my
face. You have proved that...

983
02:36:55,016 --> 02:37:03,048
...only a wicked son like you can
be born to a demoness like me.

984
02:37:03,124 --> 02:37:09,472
"Not a son like my Raju. Even if
you take my life, I won't..."

985
02:37:09,497 --> 02:37:18,292
"...give these papers to you.
- Lf you don't give it, I will..."

986
02:37:18,239 --> 02:37:22,312
...have to use other means
for taking it from you.

987
02:37:22,210 --> 02:37:26,328
"She has gone mad, snatch the
papers from him."

988
02:37:28,916 --> 02:37:35,071
"Give me the papers, mother!
- Raju, my son."

989
02:37:39,093 --> 02:37:40,572
"Snatch the papers, immediately."

990
02:37:40,561 --> 02:37:45,555
"Raju, my son!"

991
02:38:22,069 --> 02:38:23,980
Mother!

992
02:41:03,130 --> 02:41:04,688
"Father, I am leaving this house
and going."

993
02:41:04,665 --> 02:41:11,138
I know that the duty of the son
is to take care of his parents...

994
02:41:11,138 --> 02:41:14,733
...in their old age. But that was
not there in my destiny.

995
02:41:14,709 --> 02:41:20,147
"So, I have transferred all the
property in mother's name."

996
02:41:20,147 --> 02:41:26,256
"Take care of my mother
Let us go, Saraswati."

997
02:41:40,501 --> 02:41:41,854
"What are you doing,
mother?"

998
02:41:42,036 --> 02:41:49,033
"I know I am a sinner,
you give me any punishment."

999
02:41:49,110 --> 02:41:53,183
But don't leave me
and go.

1000
02:41:56,484 --> 02:42:01,478
I don't need any of
this property.

1001
02:42:04,024 --> 02:42:08,222
"I only need my son,
my son Raju!"

1002
02:42:22,443 --> 02:42:26,834
The days of happiness
have come.

1003
02:42:26,847 --> 02:42:30,999
"Whatever I wished for,
I have got."

1004
02:42:39,160 --> 02:42:43,278
"Today my mother has
called me as "son"

1005
02:42:56,510 --> 02:43:01,664
Mother! Oh my mother!
