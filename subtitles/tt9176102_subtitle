1
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:45,708
Yeah, I'll look into that.
Yes.

2
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:49,458
Thank you.

3
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,875
No kissing scene!

4
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,625
Ms. Reena is against it.

5
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:55,416
Yes, she used to do it

6
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:57,458
but after marriage
she doesn't want to do it.

7
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:05,583
Yeah, she is fine with the bikini scene
but no two-piece.

8
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:06,916
One-piece with a sarong on top.

9
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:11,041
Lovemaking scene?

10
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,541
That was never in the script!

11
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,166
How can you add it now?

12
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:17,083
I'm getting another call.
I'll call you back.

13
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,041
You've got quite an interesting job.

14
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,166
You have no idea.

15
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:24,458
Talent Manager?

16
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:25,416
Lawyer.

17
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,666
-Hi, I am--
-Leave it.

18
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:29,875
You're good-looking.

19
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,416
Your watch must be worth 1,00,000 rupees.

20
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:35,666
Does it cost more?

21
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,416
You earn well.

22
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,291
Don't look over there
but the girl sitting there

23
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,708
has been eyeing you for over ten minutes.

24
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,166
You definitely have a chance with her.

25
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,083
Go.

26
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:49,791
Go.

27
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:19,625
{\an8}Bollywood heartthrob,
Jatin Singh is now our client.

28
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:21,958
{\an8}That's true.

29
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,833
{\an8}I deserve a promotion, sir.

30
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:25,833
{\an8}That's true.

31
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,750
{\an8}And two months of paid leave as well.

32
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:30,750
{\an8}That's--

33
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,291
THE POWER OF A SLAP

34
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,166
-Leave me.
-No, I am not leaving you.

35
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,708
-Hey, listen to me.
-No!

36
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,458
You surely have someone in Pune.

37
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,583
-No, my love!
-Don't lie.

38
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,083
Are you mad?

39
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,083
Yeah, Mom.
I'll call you back.

40
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:47,625
Hey.

41
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,833
Hi.

42
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,416
Okay, bye.

43
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:52,541
Bye.

44
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,125
It was just sex.

45
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,000
You broke up with him last week.

46
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,000
Now you're back with him!
Is this some kind of a joke?

47
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,458
It was just sex!

48
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,583
The sole heir of Vardhan Industries.

49
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:03,750
Rishi Vardhan.

50
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,958
Will he move from Mumbai from Pune?

51
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,125
Never!
When you know what the problem is

52
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,250
then, either do something about it
or move on.

53
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,041
I wonder why people compromise

54
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,750
when they're going
regret in the future.

55
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,333
Yes, Ms. Front Page.

56
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,875
And I thought you
don't date your clients.

57
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,875
-That's just--
-What?

58
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:24,583
You said these actors' oiled up muscles
seem like deep-fried wedges to you.

59
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,791
I guess your diet steered
out of control with Jatin Singh.

60
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,708
I don't want to discuss about it.

61
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,541
She does.

62
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:37,208
After all, she must be excited
about her future son-in-law.

63
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,958
Yes! She has only
one excitement in life.

64
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,333
"Sia, get married.

65
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Get married."

66
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,958
Why don't you get married?

67
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,791
Hey, where's Sia Malhotra's cabin?

68
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,875
Yeah.

69
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,208
Go right in there.

70
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,750
Third cabin to the left.

71
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,041
-Cool, thanks.
-You're welcome.

72
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,083
Hey, who was that?

73
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,291
Is he an actor?

74
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,333
Writer.

75
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,916
A film's being made on his book.

76
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,833
And the tough one's on page five.

77
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:19,166
They can't make any changes
to the story without your permission.

78
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,083
Don't ask me how I convinced…

79
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,333
I-I am sorry.

80
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,125
I just landed this morning.

81
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,125
Long flights. Delays.

82
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,083
-I can't sleep on flights--
-It's okay.

83
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Coffee?

84
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,041
Can I get a bed?

85
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,500
What?

86
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:36,625
A sofa will do as well.

87
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,083
For now, you'll have
to settle for coffee.

88
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,333
Cool.

89
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,208
Shall we?

90
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,833
We serve coffee in the office.

91
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,083
That sofa looks very tempting.

92
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,666
The coffee shop will be a better option.

93
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,208
But, what was the problem?

94
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,875
They had a problem with
the ending of your book.

95
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,875
And we wanted to get
you the final approval.

96
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,375
Hey, stop!

97
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,125
They didn't like the book's ending.

98
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:05,416
Obviously.

99
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,708
I mean, people usually prefer
happy endings in films. And…

100
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:12,041
And they think my book has a sad ending.

101
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:13,458
Yes.

102
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,416
Wait! Do you think that as well?

103
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,250
How does that matter, Mr. Sarin?

104
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,666
Varun.

105
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:20,833
Varun.

106
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,875
You can't make everyone happy, right?

107
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:25,791
That's her.

108
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,083
Jatin Singh's ex.

109
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,958
She looked hot in the pictures.

110
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,083
In real life, she's pretty ordinary.

111
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,125
Really?

112
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,416
Yeah, can I please have a…

113
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,416
Is it that confusing?

114
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:42,166
I am just so used to
<i>Koffi Shoffi</i> in London.

115
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,458
By the way, you have to
try the "Varun Bean Latte" there.

116
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:49,166
Just imagine!
She slapped Jatin Singh.

117
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,666
If you want to break up,
do it in private.

118
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,250
Why should she announce it
to the whole world?

119
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,375
Show some class, man.

120
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,833
I have to make a phone call.

121
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:58,875
I'll be outside.

122
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,541
Leave it. How does it matter to me?

123
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,291
What nonsense! When did we meet?

124
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,666
Pammi, what is he saying?

125
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,583
You and him…

126
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,291
No Shalu, he's lying.

127
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,625
Pammi, when we secretly
went out to have <i>golgappas</i>

128
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,000
-didn't you fall in love with me?
-No, I didn't!

129
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,958
She isn't denying that we had <i>golgappas</i>.

130
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,291
-No--
-Pammi, you never told me

131
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,583
that you're having an affair
with such a cute guy.

132
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,458
Don't worry about anything.

133
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,000
I won't tell your husband about it.

134
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,875
Pammi darling, you're young and hot.

135
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:32,083
A bombshell like you should
be with me, sweetheart.

136
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,958
-Why did you slap me?
-What do you mean?

137
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,916
I mean you could've told me politely.

138
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,125
You could have called
the security as well.

139
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,583
You know, show some class, man.

140
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,458
These women I tell you.

141
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,958
They'll do anything for attention.

142
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,166
Marry him!

143
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,291
What?

144
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,541
He saved your honor, Sia.

145
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,125
I wasn't being kidnapped by gangsters.

146
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,708
That doesn't even
happen on TV soaps now.

147
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,833
The guy's done so much in real life.

148
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,375
That's it.
He's a hero. Marry him.

149
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,083
Today was our first meeting.

150
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,916
Then think of it
as an arranged marriage.

151
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,041
This is what happens.

152
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,875
"Hi. Hello. Welcome.

153
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,958
Take him out for some tea, dear."

154
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,375
You took him for coffee.

155
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,375
Hello, Aunt.

156
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,083
Sia likes the guy.

157
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,208
Which one?

158
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,000
The guy from London or Birmingham?

159
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,250
No one, Mom.

160
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,000
Pats is having one of her episodes.

161
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,916
Is everything fine?

162
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,666
This is your third
phone call since morning.

163
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,333
Do I need an excuse
to talk to my daughter?

164
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:47,625
Mom!

165
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,000
Anyway, when are you coming to London?

166
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,583
I am trying, Mom.

167
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,583
I'll inform you as soon as I have a plan.

168
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,083
But, aren't you going next week?

169
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,041
Bye, Mom.

170
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,000
I hope she agrees for it.

171
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:05,666
She will.

172
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,375
Mom, what is all this?

173
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:22,000
Thank God, you're here.
I thought your flight might be delayed.

174
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,458
-My bag--
-Forget the bag.

175
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,458
I'll tell you everything
in the car, Sia.

176
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,041
-What do I--
-Get ready or else we'll get late.

177
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,916
Your dress and jewelry
are on your bed.

178
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,916
You must do your makeup first.

179
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,791
-Just a minute.
-You ask too many questions.

180
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:35,708
Sia, please!

181
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,958
It will look terrible if
the guests arrive before the bride.

182
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,416
-Okay, wait.
-Yes.

183
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,083
Who is the bride?
Whose wedding is it?

184
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,916
It's your wedding.

185
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,416
-What?
-Yeah. Come on, prep her.

186
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,416
Quickly.

187
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,750
-But…
-What's wrong with you?

188
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,416
Mom!

189
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,375
Sia, why can't you be a little patient?

190
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,208
You knew I was coming?

191
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,333
When you didn't call at midnight

192
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,041
I knew you're coming in person.

193
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,125
Mom!

194
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,708
I am desperately trying
to maintain myself

195
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:18,250
and you're telling the entire
neighborhood that I've turned 50.

196
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,125
Happy birthday to me!

197
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,125
Happy birthday!

198
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,000
How long are you here for?

199
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,458
I just got here and you're
already asking when I'm leaving.

200
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,166
You can tell me if you have some plans.
I can leave.

201
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,875
Shut up. As if I have some plans.

202
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,625
How do I say this?

203
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,500
Okay?

204
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:47,750
Sia…

205
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:51,208
-Mom, I don't want to get married--
-I am getting married.

206
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,166
Wait. What?

207
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,958
I am getting married.

208
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,916
-Okay.
-His name's Nishant.

209
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,583
He's an architect here in London.

210
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,708
I am sorry.
I know I shouldn't have taken…

211
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,291
such an important decision
without discussing with you first.

212
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,708
It just happened.

213
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,083
Mom, are you happy?

214
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,583
Very happy.

215
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:17,416
Then, you don't need
anyone's permission.

216
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,625
Definitely not mine.

217
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,416
I love you so much.

218
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,375
I'm so happy for you.

219
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,000
I should tell your father, right?

220
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,833
Absolutely not.

221
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,750
It's been 15 years since your divorce.

222
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,291
And he didn't even wait for the divorce.

223
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:37,708
Yeah.

224
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,375
Okay, listen.

225
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,541
The guests at the wedding
are surely going to ask me.

226
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,000
At least now get married Sia.

227
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:51,166
Mom, what's wrong with you?

228
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,916
I love you, my child.

229
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:57,416
Is aunt marrying one
of her psycho patients?

230
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,125
He was never her patient.

231
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:02,208
One of their common friends
set up the appointment.

232
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:03,833
It was not serious.

233
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:08,416
By the way Pats, I don't think
there's a fabric store out here.

234
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,708
Are you at the right address?

235
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:13,375
The address seems right,
but the store's wrong.

236
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,958
It's the right one, ma'am.

237
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,500
Turn around.

238
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,916
Pats, when will you grow up?

239
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,041
You two were never going
to meet up on your own.

240
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,375
You're welcome.

241
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,541
Bend down, dear.

242
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,500
Is this a public garden?

243
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,416
Do you come in here for a stroll?

244
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,208
Son of a gun.

245
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,000
Son of a what now?

246
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,083
Shut up.

247
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,791
You don't want to do a single work

248
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,541
but eat here for free.

249
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,166
Are you a Pakistani?

250
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:53,708
Indian.

251
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,708
Actually British, but Indian.

252
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,083
Doesn't matter.
We are all the same.

253
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,000
Most people out here are dull.

254
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,666
But we are he active ones.

255
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,291
True.
I mean, of course.

256
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,875
No! You can talk in English.

257
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,416
I understand English really well.

258
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,208
Do you need another one?

259
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,625
What would you like?

260
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,458
Varun Bean Latte.

261
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,208
Varun…

262
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,250
Your Varun Bean Latte, ma'am.

263
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:28,916
Oh, thank you.

264
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:30,583
Hey.

265
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:34,625
What?

266
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,916
I never imagined you'll come
all the way to London for a coffee.

267
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,458
Calm down, Casanova. I am from London.

268
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,666
Really?

269
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,041
Do you always hang around here?

270
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:45,958
Yeah.

271
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,791
Either here or upstairs in my apartment.

272
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,333
Aunt said that a beautiful Indian
girl is asking for Varun Bean Latte.

273
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,125
But you're from London.

274
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,083
I came to surprise
my mom on her birthday.

275
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,125
But she surprised me.

276
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,458
She is getting married.

277
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:02,083
And you're like "you can't
get married, etcetera"!

278
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,208
Not at all.

279
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,541
I am very happy for her.

280
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,208
Oh, so you're not that grumpy.

281
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:08,333
Excuse me.

282
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,375
I guess I can ask you out for dinner.

283
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,166
I don't think so.

284
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:17,833
Ma'am, you've already spoiled your
reputation by drinking coffee with me.

285
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,458
By the way, she threw
a slipper at me this morning.

286
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,250
-Oh, God!
-And you're my witness.

287
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,083
What about a dinner with me?

288
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:37,125
I am flattered but,
first, I don't date my clients.

289
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:40,166
And second, you're not my type.

290
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,083
It's not a date.

291
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,500
You took me out for such
a coffee in India.

292
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,291
I am just returning the favor.

293
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,916
And you're not my type either.

294
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:51,541
Really?

295
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:56,500
Pretty, intelligent, successful!
Not your type?

296
00:17:56,708 --> 00:18:00,083
So, you're one of
those who like dumb girls.

297
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,000
"Oh, my God! You're a writer.

298
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,500
You must know so many big words."

299
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,125
"You actually turned out to be funny.

300
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:10,000
Are you actually like this
or just trying to be my type?"

301
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,375
Oh, please!

302
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:15,208
Are you this persistent
or just trying to bribe your lawyer?

303
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:19,250
Seriously?
Listen, not a date. Just dinner.

304
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:24,166
Okay, Ciprianis. 8:30 p.m. tonight.

305
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,250
Oh! I love Ciprianis.

306
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,125
Sia. Meet Anu, my girlfriend.

307
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,208
-Hi.
-Oh. Hi.

308
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,000
Where did this vamp
turn up in the story?

309
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:36,958
Why?

310
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:40,083
Isn't there a new twist
in your daily soaps?

311
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:44,000
And anyway, I am the vamp
in Varun and Anu's story.

312
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,375
Whatever!

313
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:47,916
Don't wear those.

314
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,375
Wear the silver ones.

315
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,125
He'll be floored, Sia.

316
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,375
He has a girlfriend.

317
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,333
Vamp! Remember!

318
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,416
Sia, Aren't vamps human beings?

319
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,541
Don't they have emotions?

320
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,583
Shut up, Pats.

321
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:06,125
So, no drugs, no alcoholism.

322
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,333
No family history of heart disease.

323
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:11,000
I'll send my medical report tomorrow.

324
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,166
No, there's no need for that.

325
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,708
Are you signing a prenup agreement?

326
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,083
As you say.

327
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,000
I am only interested in Radhika.

328
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,916
Not in her property and jewelry.

329
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,541
By the way, how much property
and jewelry do you have?

330
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,375
-I have enough of it.
-Good.

331
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,750
Okay, one last question.

332
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,583
-Stop it, Sia.
-But, Mom…

333
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,083
You're pretty fast.

334
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,791
I didn't expect to meet your
parents on our second meeting.

335
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,333
I asked you to come at 8:30 p.m.

336
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,250
Now that you're here,
would you like to join us, son?

337
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,916
-No, Mom, he'll wait at the bar.
-Sure.

338
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,000
No, Mom.

339
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,583
Sit quietly.

340
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,416
Okay, Nishant, last question.

341
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,958
Where are you two going
to live after your wedding?

342
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,916
We decided that we'll sell my place

343
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,750
and I'll move in with your mom.

344
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,875
When did we decide that?

345
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,083
You love your apartment, Nishant.

346
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,333
And your life is in your house, Radhika.

347
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,875
You've been living
in your home for 30 years.

348
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:21,125
Your kitchen, your garden, Sia's room…

349
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:24,333
Every wall, every corner's
related with some memory.

350
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,125
How can I take that away from you?

351
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,291
Okay.

352
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:32,000
So, tell us, when are
you two getting married?

353
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:34,250
What?

354
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:35,958
Sia and me?

355
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,500
We aren't even friends yet.

356
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,250
-Yeah.
-Are we?

357
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,333
I was very nervous about this dinner.

358
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,541
Thank God you turned up early.

359
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:51,958
Though you turned up early by mistake.

360
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,125
We're friends. It's the least I can do.

361
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,333
-It's abiding by it.
-No.

362
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,708
So what?
I love <i>Maine Pyaar Kiya</i>.

363
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,333
-So…
-Seriously?

364
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,500
"Pigeon, please go away."

365
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:04,666
Shut up.

366
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,208
Mom and I would watch it every Sunday.

367
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,458
Dad would get so irritated.

368
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,083
I guess he was the only
sensible person in your family.

369
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,083
Sia.

370
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:25,125
Sia, did I pass?

371
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,250
-Yes.
-Thank you.

372
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:28,708
I'll go get the car.

373
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,500
Were you going to send me in a taxi?

374
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:32,750
Maybe?

375
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,041
By the way, you must have a lot to do

376
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,083
for the wedding preparations, right?

377
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,083
I will help you out.

378
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,833
No, I'll handle it.

379
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,208
That's the problem with her.

380
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,250
Exactly! That's why I am not asking her.

381
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:48,291
You don't understand, Mom.
He might have

382
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:51,541
some "other" plans with "someone else".

383
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,208
But he's offering to help us.
What is your problem?

384
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,208
Exactly, Sia!
What is your problem?

385
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,583
I am not that bad.

386
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,250
But she's been like this since childhood.

387
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,166
And I've been helpful since childhood.

388
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,875
Yes, but no one can correct Sia.

389
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,708
Don't worry. I am here now.
We'll change her.

390
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,000
What?

391
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,875
I was deciding your number.

392
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,833
Number?

393
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:24,583
Out of all my boyfriends,

394
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,708
you're the third one.

395
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,916
Yeah, third best.

396
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:34,541
You know, I think I'll miss you.

397
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:35,833
Come on.

398
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,625
You'll not even remember
my name in some days.

399
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,291
Goodbye, my sexy writer.

400
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,375
Shit!

401
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,125
I said that I don't need your help.

402
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,666
-You insisted and then--
-You know, Anu…

403
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,000
You've made a mistake!
Accept it.

404
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:58,125
Don't make excuses.

405
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,291
I hate people who are not punctual.

406
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:02,791
And you are never on--
What?

407
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:05,083
Shit.

408
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,500
This store is closing down.

409
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:08,541
Yeah.

410
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,166
It must be because of
economy and recession.

411
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,791
They might not be making money.

412
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:16,208
All the lawyers are just worried
about your money.

413
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:18,625
You've a calculator in place of a heart.

414
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:26,208
And artist like you are
always lost in your imaginary world.

415
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:29,458
Maximum people order books online.

416
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:31,875
I read your book on Kindle.

417
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,125
No wonder you didn't like it.

418
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:38,041
The experience of holding a book…

419
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,166
That…

420
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,500
That smell of a book.

421
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,041
Can we go now?

422
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:46,458
We've to meet Tanya
before the cake tasting.

423
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,083
You may go. I'll meet you later.

424
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,041
Then, why did you waste my time?

425
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:54,791
I am feeling bad.

426
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:57,166
This place is like my…

427
00:23:57,916 --> 00:23:59,500
a part of my childhood.

428
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,041
Sorry.

429
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,083
What you want me to hug you now?

430
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:14,625
Come.

431
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,208
And yeah…
it's just a friendly hug.

432
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:22,875
Don't get any ideas.

433
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:26,625
You do have a heart as well.

434
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:28,625
Oh, my God!

435
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:31,541
Who is Tanya?

436
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:34,541
Hi.

437
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,708
Varun, that's Tanya. My little sister.

438
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:42,250
I didn't know you had a sister.

439
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:43,500
Half sister.

440
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:45,916
-Same dad, different moms.
-Okay.

441
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:47,958
-Boyfriend?
-Friend.

442
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:49,916
But why not?
Whatever!

443
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:52,500
So, you guys have to come
to my party tonight.

444
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:53,916
The theme is Bollywood

445
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:56,458
and I've just sent you the invite.

446
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:58,166
Yeah.
Be there.

447
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:00,833
Okay, fine.
What did you want to talk to me about?

448
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,208
Oh, are you talking about that?

449
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:06,875
Basically, I've decided that I
cannot be a virgin on my 18th birthday.

450
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:09,083
So, there's a guy in my class.

451
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:10,416
He's damn cute.

452
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,333
So, after the party, we're doing it.

453
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:15,666
It's high time.

454
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:19,291
Coffee? Anyone?

455
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:21,791
Frappe. Low fat, please.
Thanks.

456
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:23,416
Yeah. Sia?

457
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:25,375
No, I am okay. Thanks.

458
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:26,375
Good.

459
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:31,625
What have you decided?

460
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,416
Tanya.

461
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:37,083
Tanya.

462
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:38,250
Tanya, wait.

463
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:39,625
Stop or I'll…

464
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:47,208
What will you do?

465
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:49,583
-Will you call Dad?
-Yes.

466
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:51,583
Really?

467
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,041
Will you call Dad after 15 years?

468
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:00,208
I don't think so.

469
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:06,875
Listen, breathe in, breathe out.

470
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,666
She thinks it's fun.

471
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:11,750
Wasn't it fun for you as well?

472
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:13,125
But she is only 18.

473
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:17,041
How old were you when you…

474
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:18,291
You know…

475
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:22,041
I think we are going to party tonight.

476
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:36,166
Deepika?

477
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:38,000
Sridevi.

478
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:41,125
What about your costume?

479
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:45,583
I am Salman Khan.

480
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:47,500
Oh, my God!

481
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:49,666
What are you wearing?

482
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:51,083
The outfit from--

483
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:53,583
-The theme was Bollywood, right?
-It got canceled.

484
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,125
Didn't you get my message?

485
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,750
It's a white theme party now.

486
00:26:57,541 --> 00:27:00,583
You'll have to leave now, right?

487
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:01,750
How sad!

488
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:03,708
By the way…

489
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,625
Hotel Crimson.

490
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:10,583
Room 612.

491
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:12,666
It's happening tonight.

492
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:15,000
Do as you please.

493
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:26,250
<i>Our love is quite funky</i>

494
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:29,750
<i>Our love is quite funky</i>

495
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:33,166

504
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:55,291
<i>We'll hit a six on every over</i>

505
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:57,041
<i>Everyone parties with open eyes</i>

506
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:58,750
<i>I can party even with my eyes closed</i>

507
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:00,583
<i>My performance is electrifying</i>

508
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:02,333
<i>Like warrior that strikes</i>

509
00:28:02,416 --> 00:28:04,125
<i>Take you to a movie, or just hang out</i>

510
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:05,750
<i>Or climb on a TV tower</i>

511
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:09,500
<i>How long am I going</i>
<i>To hide the pain in my heart?</i>

512
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:13,541

<i>Oh, God!</i>

543
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:46,458
<i>Funk</i>

544
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:48,166
<i>Funk</i>

545
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:50,291
<i>Funk</i>

546
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:51,833
<i>Funky</i>

547
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:53,000
<i>Oh, God!</i>

548
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,166
Come on, Sridevi.
Move it.

549
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:03,458
Shut up.

550
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:07,083
Can I do the talking?

551
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:09,500
Trust me.

552
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:11,083
Okay.

553
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:15,250
-Hey, Shawn.
-Hi.

554
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:20,541
I am sorry, Tanya.

555
00:30:20,666 --> 00:30:22,541
Please wear your clothes.
We need to talk.

556
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:29,250
Did you come to lecture me?

557
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,416
No. I came to wish you luck.

558
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,583
What…
What are you doing here?

559
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:35,750
Babe.

560
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:38,291
We're talking.
Stand there quietly.

561
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:42,958
Tell me.

562
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:45,458
So… are you excited?

563
00:30:45,916 --> 00:30:46,750
Yeah.

564
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:49,125
-Are you scared?
-Not at all.

565
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:51,708
Everyone does it.
It's no big deal.

566
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:54,000
Exactly. Everything's perfect.

567
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:56,791
Just the way you wanted. Right?

568
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:00,750
Right.

569
00:31:00,833 --> 00:31:01,666
Wait.

570
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:03,208
Something's wrong.

571
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:04,541
Babe.

572
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:07,083
Just shut up!

573
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:10,375
You are sure about this, right?

574
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:11,666
Obviously.

575
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:15,291
Shawn is the cutest guy in my class.

576
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:16,791
Babe!

577
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:21,208
What's up?

578
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:26,500
What?

579
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:28,875
Listen, you can trust me.

580
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:32,500
Oh, please!
You're playing for the enemy team.

581
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:33,916
How can I trust you?

582
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,625
Screw that.

583
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:38,166
Tell me what the problem is.

584
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:43,208
I…

585
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,625
I wanted it to be special.

586
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:50,333
Nice hotel, wine, flowers.

587
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:53,708
It's all here but…

588
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,708
it somehow isn't.

589
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:59,666
First times are highly overrated.

590
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:02,208
There's only one thing special about it.

591
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:03,666
And that's how you feel.

592
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:07,166
None of this matters.

593
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:09,250
Just listen to your heart.

594
00:32:09,916 --> 00:32:12,291
It's because the heart is never wrong.

595
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:14,416
You know what…

596
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:17,458
whoever your girlfriend is…

597
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:20,208
she is one lucky girl.

598
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:22,208
Well, I don't have one now.

599
00:32:22,666 --> 00:32:25,125
But I will definitely tell the next one.

600
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:35,583
What?

601
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:37,541
Anu?

602
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:38,541
What happened?

603
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:39,500
Oh, that…

604
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,083
Our expiry date came up.

605
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:44,083
What nonsense!

606
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:45,500
I am speaking the truth.

607
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,583
Mom…

608
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:03,041
you are sure about Nishant, right?

609
00:33:03,708 --> 00:33:05,000
Is there a problem?

610
00:33:05,791 --> 00:33:10,041
No, but, what if just like dad he…

611
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:13,291
You and dad had
such an intense romance.

612
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:15,833
You guys eloped and got married, and yet…

613
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:18,625
-Yet we got divorced.
-Exactly.

614
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:20,333
I was 21

615
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:23,000
when I met your dad in Medical College.

616
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,041
Now I am 50.

617
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:27,875
I am not that Radhika anymore.

618
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:32,625
Yeah, but what's the guarantee
that Nishant and you…

619
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,041
Guarantee?

620
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:43,625
My sweetheart, love never
comes with a guarantee of happiness.

621
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,041
But this is the only way to love.

622
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,208
To love wholeheartedly.

623
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:50,750
You cannot put conditions on love.

624
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:57,666
Silly girl! It seems you want a guarantee.

625
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:00,166
Thank you for the massage.

626
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:03,458
-Good night.
-Good night.

627
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:32,125
<i>Just tell him.</i>

628
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:40,125
Varun is the one
you've been waiting for.

629
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:43,708
Cross out point number one.

630
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:45,875
He's never been on time.

631
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,333
Yes, but he romances like Raj.

632
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,833
He has the intensity of Rahul.

633
00:34:51,416 --> 00:34:53,041
And the values of Prem.

634
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:55,250
Just go ahead and tell him today.

635
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:58,875
Varun, I… love…

636
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:02,500
Excuse me, Ms. Chandni,
please go and sit somewhere else.

637
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:04,125
This table is reserved.

638
00:35:07,416 --> 00:35:08,833
Oh God, Sia.

639
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,083
It's all my fault.

640
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:15,166
You turned into an
alcoholic because of me.

641
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:20,250
Sorry. I am a little drunk.

642
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:24,416
You look so cute when you're drunk.

643
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:30,500
I like you.

644
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,166
I like you as well.

645
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:39,541
No, I mean I really…
I really like you.

646
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:43,625
I like you. You are cute.

647
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:47,375
We should do something about it, right?

648
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:53,041
Sia, I am not…

649
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:56,000
I am so crazy.

650
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:57,750
You're gay.

651
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,333
Of course.

652
00:35:59,416 --> 00:36:01,125
You're too cute to be straight.

653
00:36:02,291 --> 00:36:03,708
What? No!

654
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:06,333
What? Are you not cute?

655
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,375
I am not gay.

656
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:09,125
Then, what's the problem?

657
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:11,916
I am not right for you.

658
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:13,375
What are you saying?

659
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,416
Look at your scores, dude.

660
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:19,083
Perfect!

661
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:24,000
Look, I'm sure you want someone who'll
be with you for the rest of your life.

662
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:26,375
I can't do that, Sia.

663
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:29,583
-What?
-Okay, let me explain.

664
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:33,458
I think every relationship
has an expiry date.

665
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,708
And after that, it comes to an end.

666
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:37,833
Then, either people separate

667
00:36:38,416 --> 00:36:41,041
or stay together thinking
that at least they've someone.

668
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,541
And, what do you do?

669
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:45,541
I start from the end.

670
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:46,458
End?

671
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:50,000
Yeah, as in, why do I give a chance to

672
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,791
pain, sorrow, fights, quarrels?

673
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:54,250
Just finish it before that.

674
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:57,666
In my case, seven weeks.

675
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:01,833
So, you sold the same
scheme to Anu as well.

676
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:06,458
Yeah, but she knew what she was doing.

677
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:07,541
But you…

678
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,125
you might get hurt.

679
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:11,708
You know what, Varun?

680
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:16,666
Thanks for caring.

681
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:43,541
Hello.

682
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:47,583
Obviously, I was sleeping.

683
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:51,791
Yeah, the lights were on because…

684
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:07,541
-Tell me.
-What?

685
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,875
Don't waste my time, Varun.

686
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,541
I don't talk to anyone
for more than seven minutes at night.

687
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:13,666
Come on, Sia.

688
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:17,166
Why? Do you have a copyright
on setting time limits?

689
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,291
Listen, I am sorry.

690
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:23,375
It's just that I don't
have too many friends

691
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:25,541
and I don't want to lose you now.

692
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:29,458
I mean, if you still
consider me a friend.

693
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:32,375
Of course, I do.

694
00:38:32,583 --> 00:38:33,791
So, we're okay?

695
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,083
Yeah.

696
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:36,000
Sure?

697
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:38,708
Of course!
Do you want me to hug you?

698
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:41,708
Come.

699
00:38:57,416 --> 00:38:59,708
I'll…
I'll see you tomorrow.

700
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:00,791
Yeah.

701
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:43,875
So…

702
00:39:44,791 --> 00:39:46,583
what happened last night…

703
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:51,250
it clearly shows that
there's something between us.

704
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:55,416
Why don't we give each other a chance

705
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,916
and not have this seven week
ticking time bomb on our heads.

706
00:39:58,083 --> 00:40:00,208
But that's the same thing as--

707
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:01,625
It won't be.

708
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:04,125
It's because you haven't
heard my plan yet.

709
00:40:04,416 --> 00:40:05,416
Okay.

710
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:08,208
I just think that instead
of meeting every day,

711
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:10,875
we get to know someone
over a period of time.

712
00:40:11,166 --> 00:40:12,458
Over a period of time?

713
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:15,416
It sounds like a clause from
one of your legal contracts.

714
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:16,958
That reminds me something!

715
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:21,541
Oh, no! That's your list.

716
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:25,833
So, the plan is called
Tuesdays and Fridays.

717
00:40:26,916 --> 00:40:28,833
We'll meet only two days a week.

718
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,083
What?

719
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:33,583
I mean we'll be together
on Tuesdays and Fridays.

720
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:35,583
What about the other days?

721
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:37,916
We won't be together
on the rest of the days.

722
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:40,041
You can date anyone you want.

723
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:44,916
But that's not fair, right?
I can be with anyone and

724
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:47,458
you'll wait for me
on Tuesdays and Fridays.

725
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:50,458
Excuse me, even I can date anyone I want.

726
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,583
Oh!

727
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:53,875
So, here's the first rule of T&F.

728
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:55,291
Don't talk about it.

729
00:40:55,958 --> 00:40:59,250
If you're on a date
with someone on other days,

730
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:01,000
and we bump into each other

731
00:41:01,666 --> 00:41:05,583
then, I will not abuse
the girl who is with you.

732
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:10,625
But if I catch you with someone
else on Tuesdays and Fridays…

733
00:41:11,791 --> 00:41:13,125
then I will not spare that chick.

734
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,083
Rule number two.

735
00:41:15,916 --> 00:41:17,041
Don't slip up.

736
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:18,458
No random hookups.

737
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:20,791
No sex until the third date.

738
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:22,250
Wait. One second.

739
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:24,291
What if she seduces me?

740
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:25,833
I will not spare that chick.

741
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:29,458
Rule number three.

742
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:30,458
Last rule.

743
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Don't stretch it.

744
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:35,291
If either of us isn't
happy with the arrangement,

745
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:36,541
we call it quits.

746
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,708
We'll both go our separate ways.

747
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,333
No questions asked.

748
00:41:44,041 --> 00:41:45,083
So…

749
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:50,541
Can I get some time
to think about this?

750
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:54,750
Okay, I mean… yeah, sure.

751
00:41:55,708 --> 00:41:56,583
Great.

752
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:03,541
Let me know.

753
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:16,875
You know what?
You won't get time to think.

754
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:18,833
Tell me now!

755
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:27,416
It's okay. It's perfectly okay.

756
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:31,708
And, do come for the wedding.

757
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:33,250
Mom will be happy to see you.

758
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:34,500
Yes.

759
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:35,458
It's only fair.

760
00:42:35,541 --> 00:42:38,666
I mean you made most
of the wedding arrangements.

761
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:39,666
Sia.

762
00:42:40,666 --> 00:42:41,958
Yes, let's do it.

763
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:46,333
Oh! Okay!

764
00:42:47,416 --> 00:42:48,333
Good.

765
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:50,458
Cool.

766
00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:56,083
Hey!

767
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:59,541
Your mom's wedding
will be our first date, right?

768
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,791
Tomorrow is a Sunday.

769
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,875
You'll have to find another date.

770
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:06,291
Sorry.

771
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:08,291
So, let's make it Sundays and Thursdays.

772
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:11,625
Nope. Tuesdays and Fridays.

773
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,041
Yeah, but you'll definitely
say yes on Tuesday, right?

774
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:22,708
If you're lucky.

775
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,125
I am sorry.
The surgery took way too long.

776
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:43,666
Please sit down.

777
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:47,708
Tell me.
What can I do for you Ms…

778
00:43:49,708 --> 00:43:50,583
Hi, Dad.

779
00:43:51,791 --> 00:43:54,083
Sia, it's so nice to see you.

780
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:03,791
Sorry.

781
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,208
-I thought…
-That I've forgiven you?

782
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,041
You're finally meeting me
after so many years.

783
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:13,875
A little misconception is understandable.

784
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,333
Sit down.

785
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:20,583
Mom's getting married.

786
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:23,583
Wow!

787
00:44:23,958 --> 00:44:26,291
That's great. That's awesome.

788
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:28,291
Today evening.

789
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:32,083
Aren't you inviting me too late?

790
00:44:32,666 --> 00:44:34,208
I didn't come here to invite you.

791
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:36,583
I was here to tell you that mom's happy.

792
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:38,000
We're happy.

793
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,416
Here's the evidence.

794
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:43,291
No need to come.

795
00:44:45,791 --> 00:44:47,708
Here you go, doctor. Orange juice.

796
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:48,791
Thank you.

797
00:44:53,166 --> 00:44:54,291
Orange juice.

798
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,375
12:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.

799
00:44:57,875 --> 00:44:59,708
Some habits never change.

800
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:03,708
Hey, Sia.

801
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:08,458
Don't forget to send me
your wedding invite.

802
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:11,833
Don't worry. I won't come.

803
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:14,750
I'll imagine that you've forgiven me.

804
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:17,333
Just another misconception.

805
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:29,875
<i>These cursed bangles</i>
<i>Just won't stop clinking</i>

806
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:34,041
<i>My love, it's not so easy</i>
<i>To get hold of me</i>

807
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:38,291
<i>These cursed bangles</i>
<i>Just won't stop clinking</i>

808
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:42,166
<i>My love, it's not so easy</i>
<i>To get hold of me</i>

809
00:45:43,375 --> 00:45:45,416
Here you go!

810
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,291
Very nice.

811
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:51,166
Can I talk to mom?

812
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:52,375
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

813
00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:02,083
-Is this a fancy dress competition?
-What?

814
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:06,958
Since when do you like such
loud clothes and jewelry?

815
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:09,708
One has to wear this at their wedding.

816
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,833
As far as I know

817
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:14,041
being comfortable at your wedding
is not illegal.

818
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:16,000
But it won't look nice.

819
00:46:16,666 --> 00:46:18,625
I am not asking you
to wear casual clothes.

820
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:21,541
Although you can wear that if you like.

821
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,291
Wear whatever you're comfortable in.

822
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,000
Come on, now take off this outfit.

823
00:46:28,458 --> 00:46:29,375
Okay.

824
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:39,875
Now you're looking like my mom.

825
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:41,416
So pretty.

826
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:42,916
Thank you.

827
00:46:46,625 --> 00:46:49,375
I keep telling you that
this color looks lovely--

828
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:52,125
What's wrong?

829
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,583
Mom…

830
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,583
Nishant loves you a lot.

831
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:04,041
Yes.

832
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:06,583
Love you.

833
00:47:06,916 --> 00:47:08,000
I love you.

834
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:11,166
-Okay, now I have to get ready.
-Okay.

835
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:15,000
Your dad texted me.

836
00:47:19,041 --> 00:47:20,291
He congratulated me.

837
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:25,708
Okay.

838
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:32,291
It's a pathetic and stupid plan, Sia.

839
00:47:32,375 --> 00:47:33,208
Really?

840
00:47:33,291 --> 00:47:34,750
"Marry him, Sia.

841
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:36,791
Imagine that it's an arranged marriage."

842
00:47:37,041 --> 00:47:39,125
What kind of Mr. Perfect is he

843
00:47:39,208 --> 00:47:41,708
if he can't tolerate
you for seven weeks?

844
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:42,666
Exactly.

845
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:45,666
There's no clause of
expiry date in my contract.

846
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:48,708
There's a clause
for a heartbreak, ma'am.

847
00:47:48,916 --> 00:47:51,000
Why does he want to wait for seven weeks

848
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:53,458
when he can just fool around
for a week or so and leave?

849
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:56,500
Obviously, he must have agreed for it!

850
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:58,041
Varun's not that kind of a guy.

851
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:03,500
He thinks long term
relationships don't work out.

852
00:48:04,375 --> 00:48:06,416
You mean, a traumatic childhood?

853
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:08,458
Maybe?. I don't know.

854
00:48:08,958 --> 00:48:11,958
You know this seven week
system is just an excuse.

855
00:48:12,166 --> 00:48:13,583
Like an exit clause.

856
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:16,250
I've got rid of that
excuse from the contract.

857
00:48:16,625 --> 00:48:18,250
And to not make him uncomfortable,

858
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:21,416
I came up with this
no-questions-asked plan.

859
00:48:23,416 --> 00:48:24,333
Stop it.

860
00:48:26,041 --> 00:48:27,916
And that's the point, Pats.

861
00:48:28,041 --> 00:48:31,958
I want him to understand that
we won't need to cancel the plan.

862
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:34,875
Sia, that's a lot of social service!

863
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,750
Like he better be worth it.

864
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:38,125
You know what I mean.

865
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:40,625
Like… really hot.

866
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:42,916
Hi.

867
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,250
-Hi.
-Hi. Pats.

868
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:46,291
Varun.

869
00:48:47,208 --> 00:48:48,166
Varun!

870
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:49,500
Oh.

871
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:52,500
Sorry, I am late.

872
00:48:52,666 --> 00:48:53,916
That's nothing new.

873
00:48:54,208 --> 00:48:56,208
But it's not Varun's fault.

874
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:59,041
I need time to get ready.

875
00:49:00,541 --> 00:49:02,291
Hi. Kajal.

876
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,041
-Sia. Pats.
-Pats.

877
00:49:04,958 --> 00:49:05,916
Hi.

878
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:07,958
-Shall we go?
-Yeah.

879
00:49:14,416 --> 00:49:15,750
Are you sure, Sia?

880
00:49:16,416 --> 00:49:20,041
You're going to feel
like this every time.

881
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:21,458
I am sure.

882
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:34,708
Thank you.

883
00:49:35,958 --> 00:49:39,000
I thought there will be one
advantage of getting married late.

884
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:41,041
I won't have to deal with in-laws.

885
00:49:41,541 --> 00:49:44,750
If the bride's willing,
there's nothing the parents can do.

886
00:49:45,375 --> 00:49:49,541
But my bride's daughter
turned out to be her mother.

887
00:49:50,666 --> 00:49:53,416
Sia, I couldn't have asked
for a lovelier mother-in-law.

888
00:49:53,541 --> 00:49:56,541
And I promise you,
I'll keep your mom very happy.

889
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:58,708
-I love you.
-I love you.

890
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:00,041
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

891
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:01,125
Cheers, guys.

892
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:02,208
Cheers.

893
00:50:25,541 --> 00:50:26,875
Are they calling me?

894
00:50:29,583 --> 00:50:31,875
Actually, something went in my eye.

895
00:50:33,125 --> 00:50:35,083
Is the honeymoon planning done?

896
00:50:35,416 --> 00:50:37,625
Yes. They are leaving tomorrow evening.

897
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:39,250
When is Pats leaving?

898
00:50:40,125 --> 00:50:41,833
Her flight is on Tuesday evening.

899
00:50:42,416 --> 00:50:45,958
So, there will be no one
in the house on Tuesday night.

900
00:50:49,208 --> 00:50:50,416
Rule number three.

901
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,375
No sex until the third date.

902
00:50:53,666 --> 00:50:54,583
Remember?

903
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:55,583
Yeah.

904
00:50:55,833 --> 00:50:58,500
Now go back to your friend.

905
00:51:00,583 --> 00:51:01,500
Wait.

906
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:08,916
Good.

907
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,250
"I know you won't wear it.

908
00:51:28,625 --> 00:51:32,625
Wear one of your boring,
lawyer-esque dresses tomorrow."

909
00:51:41,125 --> 00:51:42,708
Sia's heart is restless.

910
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:45,125
She keeps asking, "Is it Tuesday yet?"

911
00:52:00,625 --> 00:52:02,458
-Hey stranger.
-Hey, sexy.

912
00:52:03,833 --> 00:52:04,708
Here's a tip for you.

913
00:52:05,541 --> 00:52:08,083
Sia doesn't like people who are late.

914
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,333
Here's a tip for you.

915
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:11,041
Sia likes me quite a lot.

916
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:15,125
Sia, I approve of the guy.

917
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:17,208
Go on and live your life.

918
00:52:19,958 --> 00:52:20,958
Hi.

919
00:52:24,791 --> 00:52:25,791
Seriously?

920
00:52:26,041 --> 00:52:29,208
Are we going to mix random
flavors and offer them to people?

921
00:52:30,541 --> 00:52:31,375
Yes.

922
00:52:32,625 --> 00:52:34,625
And what if your customers run away?

923
00:52:35,083 --> 00:52:36,541
We are giving them coffee for free.

924
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:38,041
They'll have to take that risk.

925
00:52:38,666 --> 00:52:40,583
And, what if they like something?

926
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:42,083
Then they can tip us.

927
00:52:42,583 --> 00:52:44,500
They can put any amount
they want in this jar.

928
00:52:44,625 --> 00:52:45,458
Cool, right?

929
00:52:45,541 --> 00:52:47,958
Cool? Don't make a fool of us.

930
00:52:48,125 --> 00:52:49,708
Go and do your work.
Stupid.

931
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:55,541
Marvelous. You're looking
so pretty in this dress.

932
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:57,458
God bless you.

933
00:52:57,583 --> 00:52:58,583
Thank you.

934
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:01,166
Oh shit.

935
00:53:01,375 --> 00:53:05,208
His only job is to break the glass.

936
00:53:07,875 --> 00:53:10,333
Breaking of glass is a good omen, right?

937
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:12,791
Come on, you're on my team.
Let's do this.

938
00:53:12,916 --> 00:53:13,916
Clean it up.

939
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:34,375
<i>O beloved, O sweetheart</i>

940
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:37,000
<i>I only keep looking at you</i>

941
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:42,625
<i>I love you so much I can't say</i>

942
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:46,375
<i>O beloved, O sweetheart</i>

943
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,333
<i>I only keep looking at you</i>

944
00:53:49,458 --> 00:53:54,708
<i>I love you so much I can't say</i>

945
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,583
<i>O beloved, we are in love</i>

946
00:54:01,083 --> 00:54:06,541
<i>I can't even sleep, beloved</i>

947
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:10,416
<i>O beloved, O sweetheart</i>

948
00:54:10,541 --> 00:54:13,250
<i>I only keep looking at you</i>

949
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:19,041
<i>I love you so much</i>
<i>How can you forget that?</i>

950
00:54:19,416 --> 00:54:22,333
<i>O beloved, O sweetheart</i>

951
00:54:22,458 --> 00:54:25,333
<i>I only keep looking at you</i>

952
00:54:25,541 --> 00:54:31,041
<i>I love you so much</i>
<i>How can you forget that?</i>

953
00:54:31,125 --> 00:54:35,708
<i>O beloved, we are in love</i>

954
00:54:37,083 --> 00:54:42,166
-<i>I can't even sleep, beloved</i>
-<i>I can't even sleep, beloved</i>

955
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:43,708
<i>Hey, beautiful</i>

956
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:46,375
<i>Your love has already claimed so many</i>

957
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:50,500
<i>Fighting like an army, it's hard to defeat</i>

958
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:52,333
<i>There's destruction everywhere</i>

959
00:54:52,416 --> 00:54:53,833
<i>All the noise and explosion</i>

960
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:55,416
<i>Doesn't let me sleep a wink</i>

961
00:54:56,583 --> 00:54:58,833
<i>Decide our fate</i>

962
00:54:58,958 --> 00:55:00,041
<i>To God I plead</i>

963
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:01,875
<i>Bullets are fired</i>

964
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:04,083
<i>Money is what people desire</i>

965
00:55:04,166 --> 00:55:06,083
<i>It's your memories I treasure</i>

966
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:08,583
<i>Shedding tears is not a pleasure</i>

967
00:55:09,083 --> 00:55:10,083
<i>Life's fading away</i>

968
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:11,625
<i>Yet when anyone asks, how's your day</i>

969
00:55:11,791 --> 00:55:13,041
<i>I say fine anyway</i>

970
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,041
<i>I'd given up writing songs</i>
<i>All seemed so bleak</i>

971
00:55:16,166 --> 00:55:18,916
<i>Once again, in it solace I seek</i>

972
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:19,833
<i>You are the one I need</i>

973
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:24,791
<i>O beloved, we are in love</i>

974
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:30,833
<i>I can't even sleep, beloved</i>

975
00:55:31,875 --> 00:55:36,583
<i>O beloved, we are in love</i>

976
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:43,041
<i>I can't even sleep, beloved</i>

977
00:55:49,375 --> 00:55:51,708
So, how many stars out of five?

978
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:54,416
-What?
-For this date.

979
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:55,875
Oh.

980
00:55:56,125 --> 00:55:58,375
Well, all's well that ends well.

981
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:01,250
Let's see what you've
planned for the end.

982
00:56:01,833 --> 00:56:04,041
But you don't like my "endings", right?

983
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,583
Oh, God!

984
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:08,833
Fine, here you go.
The protagonist of your book.

985
00:56:09,416 --> 00:56:11,625
She loves her husband so much

986
00:56:12,291 --> 00:56:14,375
and yet leaves him in the end.

987
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,041
She gives up.

988
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:17,666
Yeah.

989
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:20,166
And that's what maximum readers liked.

990
00:56:20,541 --> 00:56:21,750
Especially women.

991
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:27,208
She doesn't waste her life for
a man who might never understand her.

992
00:56:31,166 --> 00:56:32,625
Okay, you tell me.

993
00:56:33,625 --> 00:56:34,708
What would you have done?

994
00:56:38,916 --> 00:56:40,208
I would've tried a little harder.

995
00:56:40,541 --> 00:56:41,583
For that fool?

996
00:56:42,458 --> 00:56:44,000
He's got a million issues in his life.

997
00:56:45,333 --> 00:56:49,583
Yeah, but when it's about
that special someone,

998
00:56:50,083 --> 00:56:52,250
then relationships
need a little more time.

999
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,666
And, what if this feeling is one-sided?

1000
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,750
But it isn't one-sided in this case.

1001
00:57:01,833 --> 00:57:05,041
There are issues in our relationship
but there's also love.

1002
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:05,958
Right?

1003
00:57:14,416 --> 00:57:18,000
Varun, I can't do this anymore.

1004
00:57:22,583 --> 00:57:25,250
I can't walk in these heels anymore.

1005
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:26,958
Shall we take a cab instead?

1006
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:31,541
What are you doing?

1007
00:57:32,041 --> 00:57:33,666
You can pay me instead of the cab.

1008
00:57:33,916 --> 00:57:35,000
Put me down.

1009
00:57:35,166 --> 00:57:38,083
We'll cover the distance
to your home in ten minutes.

1010
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:40,916
Please hold on to me
and keep kissing me.

1011
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:43,166
Thank you for flying Varun Airways.

1012
00:57:54,666 --> 00:57:55,500
It's 12 o'clock.

1013
00:57:55,916 --> 00:57:56,791
What?

1014
00:57:57,833 --> 00:57:59,416
Tuesday's over.

1015
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:00,583
So?

1016
00:58:01,666 --> 00:58:03,291
So, time's up.

1017
00:58:04,083 --> 00:58:06,041
This is not a joke.

1018
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,458
Sorry, rules are rules.

1019
00:58:12,458 --> 00:58:14,375
Okay, good night.

1020
00:58:53,833 --> 00:58:56,166
You said that the papers
will be signed by Thursday.

1021
00:58:56,583 --> 00:58:58,916
I would've known if it was a Friday.
Trust me.

1022
00:58:59,291 --> 00:59:01,375
Please get this done today.
Thank you.

1023
00:59:09,041 --> 00:59:11,875
"I know it's Friday but we
might not be able to meet today.

1024
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,125
I am very busy."

1025
00:59:27,583 --> 00:59:29,333
Isn't today Sia's day?

1026
00:59:30,041 --> 00:59:32,291
-How are you meeting me?
-I am a man of my own free will.

1027
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,166
Not someone's slave.

1028
00:59:34,291 --> 00:59:37,500
Look at my Romeo!

1029
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:39,375
Don't get too enthusiastic.

1030
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,000
You're breaking her rule.

1031
00:59:41,541 --> 00:59:42,916
What if she finds out?

1032
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:45,458
Are you going to lie to her?

1033
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:46,875
Why should I lie to her?

1034
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:50,583
Will she feel bad?

1035
00:59:51,666 --> 00:59:53,583
Our case is different.

1036
00:59:58,625 --> 00:59:59,916
I am hot.

1037
01:00:00,166 --> 01:00:01,583
I am sexy.

1038
01:00:01,833 --> 01:00:03,916
Won't she be jealous seeing you with me?

1039
01:00:09,166 --> 01:00:10,291
I'd like to point out

1040
01:00:10,416 --> 01:00:14,041
that any regular Indian husband
would be very jealous

1041
01:00:14,208 --> 01:00:17,000
to see his wife with some "other" man.

1042
01:00:17,916 --> 01:00:19,541
But I'm a modern Indian man.

1043
01:00:19,875 --> 01:00:21,375
And I trust my wife.

1044
01:00:23,666 --> 01:00:25,291
Baby, in case you don't need anything

1045
01:00:25,416 --> 01:00:27,125
I'll go clear the bills.

1046
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:28,291
Of course, go ahead.

1047
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:31,833
What did he mean?

1048
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:33,333
I love him.

1049
01:00:34,875 --> 01:00:36,208
The whole of Southhall knows that.

1050
01:00:37,916 --> 01:00:40,000
You really haven't talked to her.

1051
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,541
For three days.

1052
01:00:46,958 --> 01:00:47,791
Sia.

1053
01:00:49,666 --> 01:00:50,833
Kaju, what the--

1054
01:00:52,583 --> 01:00:54,041
"Can we jacuzzi together?"

1055
01:00:55,791 --> 01:00:57,875
-She's talking about bathing together.
-Yeah, right.

1056
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,083
-See!
-<i>6 o'clock. My house.</i>

1057
01:01:01,583 --> 01:01:03,000
<i>And don't be late.</i>

1058
01:01:11,166 --> 01:01:12,333
Mister, my money!

1059
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,875
Do you have a condom?

1060
01:01:20,791 --> 01:01:22,333
I'll give you ten pounds.

1061
01:01:22,583 --> 01:01:23,541
20 pounds!

1062
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:30,375
You can never be on time, can you?

1063
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,333
Let's go or we'll actually be late.

1064
01:01:34,666 --> 01:01:35,500
Taxi.

1065
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:36,541
What?

1066
01:01:45,583 --> 01:01:48,208
I am redecorating mom
and Nishant's bathroom.

1067
01:01:49,458 --> 01:01:50,291
Oh.

1068
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:52,958
Oh.

1069
01:01:53,083 --> 01:01:54,916
Why? What did you think?

1070
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:58,291
Well, I thought we've
been on three dates, right.

1071
01:01:58,416 --> 01:02:00,791
So, according to the rules…

1072
01:02:03,958 --> 01:02:06,916
Not everything happens
according to the rules.

1073
01:02:15,708 --> 01:02:17,541
You completely ignored me today.

1074
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:19,041
Sorry.

1075
01:02:19,416 --> 01:02:21,166
There was so much
work in the office today.

1076
01:02:21,416 --> 01:02:23,833
Emails, con-calls. Don't ask.

1077
01:02:24,666 --> 01:02:26,250
What did you do?

1078
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:27,541
I was with Ka…

1079
01:02:28,666 --> 01:02:31,541
K-- Koffee-Shoffi.
I was at the cafe.

1080
01:02:32,083 --> 01:02:35,166
Meetings. Writing.
Meetings. That's all.

1081
01:02:35,458 --> 01:02:37,083
"Are you going to lie to her?"

1082
01:02:37,208 --> 01:02:38,375
"Why should I lie to her?"

1083
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:39,583
Something's wrong?

1084
01:02:40,166 --> 01:02:41,000
What?

1085
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:43,041
Something's wrong with this tub.

1086
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:44,083
Next?

1087
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:51,708
-Have you ever lied to anyone?
-No.

1088
01:02:51,958 --> 01:02:55,083
I mean, have you ever two-timed anyone?

1089
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:57,958
I hate liars.

1090
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,916
There must be something that you
don't like even in your favorite films.

1091
01:03:05,208 --> 01:03:06,166
Shall I tell you?

1092
01:03:12,625 --> 01:03:13,458
This.

1093
01:03:13,708 --> 01:03:16,333
I mean the hero stands
with his arms stretched.

1094
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:21,083
And the poor heroine runs towards
him in a chiffon sari and heels.

1095
01:03:21,416 --> 01:03:26,166
I mean you can run halfway, dimwit.

1096
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:31,666
<i>I wait for you, my darling</i>

1097
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:37,708
<i>Come closer o sweetheart</i>

1098
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:43,750
<i>Can't bear this pain</i>

1099
01:03:44,291 --> 01:03:49,625
<i>I've to cry in solitude</i>

1100
01:03:49,958 --> 01:03:52,833
<i>O beloved, O sweetheart</i>

1101
01:03:52,958 --> 01:03:55,750
<i>You didn't even think about me</i>

1102
01:03:55,875 --> 01:03:58,791
<i>You're my only love, sweetheart</i>

1103
01:03:58,916 --> 01:04:01,416
<i>We are in love</i>

1104
01:04:01,541 --> 01:04:05,958
<i>O beloved, we are in love</i>

1105
01:04:07,583 --> 01:04:13,291
<i>I can't even sleep, beloved</i>

1106
01:04:13,541 --> 01:04:18,000
<i>O beloved, we are in love</i>

1107
01:04:19,958 --> 01:04:25,291
<i>I can't even sleep, beloved</i>

1108
01:04:36,041 --> 01:04:37,000
Hi.

1109
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:38,750
One Sia Bean Latte please.

1110
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:39,666
On it.

1111
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:40,791
Not bad.

1112
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:42,833
So, when do I get
the next three chapters?

1113
01:04:43,416 --> 01:04:44,541
-Sorry.
-What's the matter, dear?

1114
01:04:44,625 --> 01:04:45,541
-New chapters?
-You're glowing today.

1115
01:04:45,625 --> 01:04:46,458
Next week.

1116
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,166
Aloo Vera?

1117
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:50,375
-It's aloe Vera, Aunt!
-Shut up.

1118
01:04:50,708 --> 01:04:51,666
Here's your coffee.

1119
01:04:51,916 --> 01:04:52,791
Thank you, Aunt.

1120
01:04:52,916 --> 01:04:54,208
You're welcome.

1121
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:56,666
Hey.

1122
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:58,583
Hi.

1123
01:04:58,875 --> 01:04:59,708
Hi.

1124
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:01,916
Meet Zeenat, my editor.

1125
01:05:02,041 --> 01:05:02,916
-Hi.
-Hi, nice to meet you.

1126
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,958
And that's Sia. My…

1127
01:05:06,791 --> 01:05:09,166
-My…
-What's the day today?

1128
01:05:10,541 --> 01:05:11,541
Saturday.

1129
01:05:11,666 --> 01:05:12,541
Saturday.

1130
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:15,250
So, I am Varun's friend today.

1131
01:05:23,041 --> 01:05:24,125
Sia, wait.

1132
01:05:26,625 --> 01:05:28,041
-Hey.
-Hi.

1133
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,750
Can you spend some
time with a friend today?

1134
01:05:30,833 --> 01:05:32,833
Of course. I am waiting for him.

1135
01:05:39,125 --> 01:05:40,208
-Hi.
-Hey.

1136
01:05:40,916 --> 01:05:42,625
This is Jatin.

1137
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:45,000
My…

1138
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:46,833
ex-boyfriend.

1139
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:48,625
Yeah.

1140
01:05:49,458 --> 01:05:50,291
Let me guess.

1141
01:05:50,583 --> 01:05:51,708
He's your new boyfriend.

1142
01:05:51,791 --> 01:05:52,875
No, bro.

1143
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:54,291
What's the day today?

1144
01:05:55,291 --> 01:05:56,375
What's the day today?

1145
01:05:56,583 --> 01:05:57,458
Saturday.

1146
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:59,916
So, I am just Sia's friend today.

1147
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:04,458
By the way, Jatin, even I got slapped
because of you slapping incident.

1148
01:06:04,583 --> 01:06:05,916
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

1149
01:06:06,125 --> 01:06:07,583
Anyway, what's the plan?

1150
01:06:08,291 --> 01:06:11,000
Well, today is the opening
of my friend's new club.

1151
01:06:11,208 --> 01:06:12,083
Silver Shadow.

1152
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:13,625
Sia and I are going there.

1153
01:06:13,708 --> 01:06:14,583
Why don't you come along?

1154
01:06:14,666 --> 01:06:15,500
-It'll be fun.
-Yeah.

1155
01:06:15,583 --> 01:06:17,458
I don't think Varun can join us.

1156
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:19,041
Right, Varun?

1157
01:06:19,458 --> 01:06:20,291
Right?

1158
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:22,166
Shall we?

1159
01:06:22,416 --> 01:06:23,250
Yeah, sure.

1160
01:06:33,375 --> 01:06:34,208
I love you.

1161
01:06:35,375 --> 01:06:36,208
What?

1162
01:06:36,416 --> 01:06:37,250
Tell him.

1163
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:38,958
No need for that.

1164
01:06:39,083 --> 01:06:40,041
Or I'll tell him.

1165
01:06:40,541 --> 01:06:42,750
If you try anything
like that, I'll thrash you.

1166
01:06:44,416 --> 01:06:45,750
There's no need for that.

1167
01:06:45,916 --> 01:06:47,541
Your slap was enough.

1168
01:06:47,791 --> 01:06:51,583
Sorry, I forgot all my
lines in front of the media.

1169
01:06:51,666 --> 01:06:54,041
Yeah, but you didn't forget to slap me.

1170
01:06:54,625 --> 01:06:59,833
Yeah, but did anyone ever ask
again "why is Jatin Singh single?"

1171
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:01,166
Well…

1172
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:04,375
cheers!

1173
01:07:06,875 --> 01:07:08,416
She's wearing my dress
on a date with him.

1174
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:11,291
Your dress?

1175
01:07:13,041 --> 01:07:14,125
Bloody alcoholic.

1176
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:15,416
Bloody stalker!

1177
01:07:15,666 --> 01:07:17,416
So, tell me.
How is your boyfriend?

1178
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,458
-Shut up.
-Sorry.

1179
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:22,916
Sia, there are many Indians here.

1180
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,041
I know.

1181
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:25,958
He's fine.

1182
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:27,875
When do I get to meet him?

1183
01:07:28,666 --> 01:07:30,416
-He's coming tonight.
-Really?

1184
01:07:30,791 --> 01:07:31,666
Nice!

1185
01:07:31,875 --> 01:07:32,708
You can meet him.

1186
01:07:34,708 --> 01:07:35,541
Shit!

1187
01:07:36,458 --> 01:07:37,625
I think she saw us.

1188
01:07:38,083 --> 01:07:39,541
That was the plan, right?

1189
01:07:40,583 --> 01:07:41,458
Yes.

1190
01:07:42,041 --> 01:07:43,041
Is she still looking here?

1191
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:46,750
Nope, they left.

1192
01:08:00,666 --> 01:08:01,541
Good evening.

1193
01:08:01,708 --> 01:08:05,541
You can watch this show
only on Tuesdays and Fridays.

1194
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:08,208
Don't try to watch it on other days.

1195
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:09,750
Otherwise…

1196
01:08:10,166 --> 01:08:12,750
We apologize for the interruption

1197
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:17,500
<i>Don't look at me with prying eyes</i>

1198
01:08:17,625 --> 01:08:20,000
<i>It makes my heart skip a beat</i>

1199
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:30,458
<i>Put your feelings on hold</i>

1200
01:08:30,583 --> 01:08:32,791
<i>It makes my heart skip a beat</i>

1201
01:08:40,166 --> 01:08:43,208
<i>Don't look at me with prying eyes</i>

1202
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,708
<i>It makes my heart skip a beat</i>

1203
01:08:45,791 --> 01:08:48,833
<i>Put your feelings on hold</i>

1204
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,208
<i>It makes my heart skip a beat</i>

1205
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:55,000
<i>I know his face glows like the moon</i>

1206
01:08:55,083 --> 01:09:00,416
<i>But his reputation precedes him</i>

1207
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:03,500
<i>Don't be so brazen</i>

1208
01:09:03,791 --> 01:09:06,416
<i>It makes my heart skip a beat</i>

1209
01:09:28,708 --> 01:09:30,250
<i>That's great</i>

1210
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:32,041
<i>That's great</i>

1211
01:09:32,416 --> 01:09:33,791
<i>That's great</i>

1212
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:35,541
<i>That's great</i>

1213
01:09:35,666 --> 01:09:39,166
<i>As I feel your eyes caressing my body</i>

1214
01:09:39,583 --> 01:09:42,916
<i>You're nice but your</i>
<i>Intentions are naughty</i>

1215
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:46,666
<i>Your gaze hits me like a dart</i>

1216
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:50,291
<i>It's sharp but hits close to my heart</i>

1217
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:54,000
<i>The way your eyes are stuck on me</i>

1218
01:09:54,208 --> 01:09:57,708
<i>Annoys me a bit but also pleases me</i>

1219
01:09:59,541 --> 01:10:02,750
<i>Stop ogling like that</i>

1220
01:10:02,875 --> 01:10:05,541
<i>It makes my heart skip a beat</i>

1221
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,000
That's my brother, Ali.

1222
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:22,541
But, what's he doing
with your girlfriend?

1223
01:10:22,708 --> 01:10:23,708
I don't know.

1224
01:10:24,125 --> 01:10:25,916
Maybe he's Sia's second date tonight.

1225
01:10:26,416 --> 01:10:29,750
My brother would be more
interested in you than Sia.

1226
01:10:30,875 --> 01:10:33,416
Anyway, I am too drunk.
I am heading home.

1227
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:35,541
Please deal with your love story.

1228
01:10:38,291 --> 01:10:39,750
<i>From Mumbai to London</i>

1229
01:10:39,833 --> 01:10:41,916
<i>You've a long line of lovers</i>

1230
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:43,375
<i>They are all ordinary</i>

1231
01:10:43,458 --> 01:10:45,583
<i>But I am like a fine wine</i>

1232
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:49,375
<i>You can fly here</i>
<i>And there my little birdie</i>

1233
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:52,916
<i>The key to your heart is with me</i>

1234
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:56,750
<i>This fool thinks he is a player</i>

1235
01:10:56,875 --> 01:11:01,166
<i>Doesn't know he is being played</i>

1236
01:11:02,375 --> 01:11:05,541
<i>Your intentions are as naughty as mine</i>

1237
01:11:05,666 --> 01:11:07,791
<i>It makes my heart skip a beat</i>

1238
01:11:38,583 --> 01:11:40,625
I know it's Saturday.

1239
01:11:41,291 --> 01:11:44,083
But can't a friend
give his friend a lift home?

1240
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:52,583
Listen, we'll make a quick
stop at my mom's place.

1241
01:11:52,666 --> 01:11:54,041
-Why?
-Chill.

1242
01:11:54,416 --> 01:11:56,000
I am not going to make you meet my mother.

1243
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:58,166
Tomorrow is my weekly
Sunday dinner with mom.

1244
01:11:58,291 --> 01:11:59,500
And I won't be able to make it.

1245
01:11:59,833 --> 01:12:02,750
So, I thought I'll butter her up.

1246
01:12:03,125 --> 01:12:05,166
Are all the days in your week fixed?

1247
01:12:05,291 --> 01:12:07,458
Tuesday, Friday, Sunday.

1248
01:12:07,916 --> 01:12:08,750
Tell me about it.

1249
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,750
Ever since I met you,
my brain has become a calendar.

1250
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:19,291
Does your mom live
alone in this huge house.

1251
01:12:19,666 --> 01:12:21,500
No, she has only two rooms for herself.

1252
01:12:22,041 --> 01:12:23,333
The rest of the place is for her NGO.

1253
01:12:23,541 --> 01:12:25,666
A lot of other women live here with her.

1254
01:12:25,833 --> 01:12:27,250
I'll be back in a minute.

1255
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:28,416
Okay!

1256
01:12:44,916 --> 01:12:45,833
Okay!

1257
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:50,625
Dedicating your entire
life for helping others…

1258
01:12:50,916 --> 01:12:52,583
I think it's quite commendable.

1259
01:12:54,916 --> 01:12:59,625
If you ever need legal advice
for your NGO, please call me.

1260
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:03,333
Sia, one of our volunteers is a lawyer.

1261
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:05,208
But thank you for the offer.

1262
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:11,958
I can also volunteer here.

1263
01:13:12,333 --> 01:13:14,041
I mean as long as I am in London.

1264
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:15,875
Varun was saying that…

1265
01:13:18,291 --> 01:13:19,875
Why are you doing all this?

1266
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:21,083
What?

1267
01:13:21,208 --> 01:13:24,083
I don't interfere in
Varun's personal life.

1268
01:13:25,291 --> 01:13:27,625
And you don't need my permission.

1269
01:13:28,125 --> 01:13:29,041
Understood?

1270
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:36,041
I won't leave him like
his other girlfriends.

1271
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:38,666
I just want to assure him

1272
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:41,666
that some people know
how to abide by relationships.

1273
01:13:47,291 --> 01:13:48,458
Would you like some tea?

1274
01:13:50,291 --> 01:13:54,208
Aren't you the same girl
who didn't like his book's ending?

1275
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,458
Actually…

1276
01:13:56,916 --> 01:13:58,500
He was not complaining.

1277
01:13:59,041 --> 01:14:01,750
The entire world read his book.

1278
01:14:03,166 --> 01:14:06,708
But I guess he wrote it just for me.

1279
01:14:07,416 --> 01:14:10,541
Since childhood,
he's only seen my loneliness.

1280
01:14:11,416 --> 01:14:12,875
I wish he could understand…

1281
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:17,166
that sometimes we
choose to be lonely.

1282
01:14:17,708 --> 01:14:19,416
I didn't understand.

1283
01:14:21,291 --> 01:14:22,208
Kajal.

1284
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:24,875
Come here.

1285
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,375
I am dead.

1286
01:14:26,458 --> 01:14:27,708
-Come.
-Hi.

1287
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:30,541
Sia.

1288
01:14:31,375 --> 01:14:32,333
This is Kajal.

1289
01:14:32,875 --> 01:14:34,500
Varun's childhood friend.

1290
01:14:34,833 --> 01:14:35,666
Really?

1291
01:14:35,791 --> 01:14:38,541
Kajal and her husband
are our star volunteers.

1292
01:14:39,458 --> 01:14:41,125
You do a lot of social work, right?

1293
01:14:41,208 --> 01:14:43,375
She is really good at it.

1294
01:14:43,958 --> 01:14:45,041
Thank you, Aunt.

1295
01:14:50,541 --> 01:14:53,333
It's Monday. Why are you calling?

1296
01:14:53,458 --> 01:14:55,125
We're going to break a rule today.

1297
01:14:55,666 --> 01:14:56,708
I thought I should tell you.

1298
01:14:56,958 --> 01:14:57,791
What?

1299
01:14:57,916 --> 01:14:59,500
I've just returned to London.

1300
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:02,416
And my agent's set up
back-to-back meetings in Seattle.

1301
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:03,625
I've to leave tomorrow.

1302
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:04,625
So?

1303
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:05,958
So, let's meet today.

1304
01:15:08,666 --> 01:15:10,083
Sorry, Varun.

1305
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:11,291
Yeah, I know.

1306
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:12,750
Rules are rules.

1307
01:15:23,958 --> 01:15:26,291
It will be midnight in a
minute and Tuesday will begin.

1308
01:15:26,416 --> 01:15:27,916
My flight leaves at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow.

1309
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,791
So, you're going to
spend the night with me.

1310
01:15:29,875 --> 01:15:31,750
And I am not taking no for an answer.

1311
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:36,500
Is this a friend asking or a boyfriend?

1312
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:38,083
Well, it's a friend's command…

1313
01:15:40,708 --> 01:15:42,916
and a boyfriend's request.

1314
01:15:51,041 --> 01:15:52,541
One second.

1315
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:25,000
This is all so cute.

1316
01:16:25,291 --> 01:16:27,958
Did you realize that we've never
been on a date?

1317
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:29,708
Hi, Varun.

1318
01:16:30,625 --> 01:16:31,458
Sia.

1319
01:16:33,916 --> 01:16:37,041
Do you kidnap every girl from her home
on your date night?

1320
01:16:37,166 --> 01:16:40,125
Do you wear nightclothes
on all your dates?

1321
01:16:41,416 --> 01:16:43,750
No. But I ran into this scoundrel.

1322
01:16:43,875 --> 01:16:45,875
He sent me a scandalously short dress

1323
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,500
for our first date.

1324
01:16:48,458 --> 01:16:51,291
Guys are such perverts nowadays.

1325
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:52,833
But listen to this.

1326
01:16:53,083 --> 01:16:54,291
I met someone.

1327
01:16:54,833 --> 01:16:57,083
And she took me to a
Jacuzzi store for a date.

1328
01:16:57,291 --> 01:17:00,125
She wore a hot bikini
and took a shower with me.

1329
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:02,250
-Really?
-I swear.

1330
01:17:04,708 --> 01:17:06,125
Oldest story in the book.

1331
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:08,833
He cheated on Mom.

1332
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:13,000
I got to know about it before Mom
and that was the twist in the tale.

1333
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,125
Every evening I would give
orange juice to Dad.

1334
01:17:22,666 --> 01:17:26,583
One day I walked in on him
talking to his other wife and daughter.

1335
01:17:27,958 --> 01:17:28,958
That's all.

1336
01:17:29,208 --> 01:17:30,041
Tanya?

1337
01:17:30,666 --> 01:17:31,500
Yeah.

1338
01:17:32,125 --> 01:17:34,083
My story isn't so dramatic.

1339
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:36,208
Everything was perfect.

1340
01:17:36,541 --> 01:17:38,625
And suddenly he just left.

1341
01:17:40,666 --> 01:17:41,875
Did he get married again?

1342
01:17:42,375 --> 01:17:44,083
That's the funny thing. He didn't.

1343
01:17:44,833 --> 01:17:47,125
Maybe we just weren't enough for him.

1344
01:17:54,375 --> 01:17:56,125
I don't kiss on first dates.

1345
01:17:56,666 --> 01:17:57,625
It's my rule.

1346
01:17:57,833 --> 01:17:59,666
To hell with your rules, Sia.

1347
01:18:01,208 --> 01:18:03,166
-Why are you yelling?
-I don't know.

1348
01:18:03,291 --> 01:18:04,166
Are you okay?

1349
01:18:04,291 --> 01:18:05,708
No, I am not.

1350
01:18:06,125 --> 01:18:07,541
What happens to me when I am with you?

1351
01:18:08,416 --> 01:18:09,833
Why do I bear your tantrums?

1352
01:18:10,375 --> 01:18:12,791
I keep planning that the next time we meet

1353
01:18:12,875 --> 01:18:14,750
I am going to say this, do that.
Why?

1354
01:18:14,833 --> 01:18:15,916
I should be having fun.

1355
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,291
Technically I am allowed
to according to your stupid rules.

1356
01:18:19,958 --> 01:18:22,416
Wait, and what am I doing?

1357
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:24,500
What was I thinking?

1358
01:18:25,166 --> 01:18:27,750
If we meet twice a week,
you'll understand my value.

1359
01:18:27,958 --> 01:18:29,083
You'll miss me more.

1360
01:18:29,208 --> 01:18:32,583
Well congratulations, Ms. Lawyer.
Your deal is working.

1361
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:35,458
I've been lying and arguing!

1362
01:18:35,583 --> 01:18:37,708
Every relationship has arguments, Varun.

1363
01:18:37,833 --> 01:18:40,083
Not in mine.
But it's happening with you.

1364
01:18:40,291 --> 01:18:42,833
And you know, I am angry
with myself more than you.

1365
01:18:42,958 --> 01:18:44,500
Why do I let you do this to me?

1366
01:18:44,625 --> 01:18:47,208
I keep calling you even when
I know you'll disconnect my calls.

1367
01:18:47,291 --> 01:18:48,833
-Why do you call me?
-I don't know.

1368
01:18:48,916 --> 01:18:50,750
-Maybe just to tell you that…
-What?

1369
01:18:50,833 --> 01:18:51,708
That am thinking about you.

1370
01:18:51,791 --> 01:18:53,041
-That's pathetic!
-I know.

1371
01:18:53,125 --> 01:18:54,458
-And very cute.
-Thank you.

1372
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:01,708
Wait. What about your first date rule?

1373
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,333
Just shut up and kiss me.

1374
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:40,250
Sia, where were you all night?

1375
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:41,958
-Sorry.
-Mom, when did you return?

1376
01:19:42,375 --> 01:19:44,500
Just a while back.
Nishant's gone upstairs to take a nap.

1377
01:19:44,583 --> 01:19:47,125
You weren't in your room, so I was…

1378
01:19:49,125 --> 01:19:50,750
Tuesdays and Fridays.

1379
01:19:52,375 --> 01:19:53,916
How did you come up with this plan?

1380
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:57,291
I am a psychiatrist's daughter.

1381
01:19:57,708 --> 01:19:59,166
The effect's bound to show.

1382
01:20:02,583 --> 01:20:03,416
What now?

1383
01:20:05,125 --> 01:20:06,125
Nothing.

1384
01:20:06,666 --> 01:20:09,583
When he comes back, I'll tell him
that we'll stop following the rules.

1385
01:20:14,125 --> 01:20:16,291
Mom, I love him.

1386
01:20:21,166 --> 01:20:22,208
Now get some sleep.

1387
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:25,000
I'll wake you up in two hours
or else you'll stay awake all night.

1388
01:20:25,083 --> 01:20:27,041
-But--
-In. Come on, Sia.

1389
01:20:34,375 --> 01:20:35,791
I really love him.

1390
01:20:52,041 --> 01:20:55,625
Listen, you bloody fool.
Keep this caringfully over there.

1391
01:20:56,208 --> 01:20:58,583
If you break one of these,
then, I'll break your legs.

1392
01:20:58,708 --> 01:21:00,416
I'll be caringful.

1393
01:21:02,416 --> 01:21:03,291
Be careful.

1394
01:21:05,875 --> 01:21:06,708
Hi, Aunt.

1395
01:21:06,958 --> 01:21:09,208
-Is Varun back?
-Yes. He's upstairs.

1396
01:21:09,333 --> 01:21:10,458
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

1397
01:21:12,458 --> 01:21:14,875
Aunt, have you ever been in love?

1398
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:17,666
Well, we all make mistakes.

1399
01:21:19,916 --> 01:21:21,166
To heck with him!

1400
01:21:24,708 --> 01:21:25,625
Imroz!

1401
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:29,250
You finally got your revenge, Mother.

1402
01:21:29,708 --> 01:21:30,791
What are you saying, mother?

1403
01:21:30,875 --> 01:21:34,875
We made you do the chores
and you made our son slog in return.

1404
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,750
Mom, please don't say anything to her.

1405
01:21:36,833 --> 01:21:41,583
Are you happy targeting our son?

1406
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:43,291
Nabeel…

1407
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:45,875
is he my grandson?

1408
01:21:46,041 --> 01:21:48,083
She is such a drama queen.

1409
01:21:48,291 --> 01:21:50,583
She can serve others

1410
01:21:50,875 --> 01:21:54,166
but she couldn't serve a cup of tea
to her own son and daughter-in-law.

1411
01:21:54,875 --> 01:21:56,791
For God's sake, please spare us.

1412
01:21:57,125 --> 01:21:58,666
Nabeel, let's go.

1413
01:21:59,458 --> 01:22:00,333
Let's go.

1414
01:22:03,833 --> 01:22:04,708
Nabeel.

1415
01:22:04,958 --> 01:22:06,125
You can't force me, Father.

1416
01:22:06,958 --> 01:22:08,708
I lost her once because of you two.

1417
01:22:08,833 --> 01:22:09,666
Not again.

1418
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:11,750
Is that the way to talk to your father?

1419
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,541
I learnt it from you.

1420
01:22:14,625 --> 01:22:16,375
I will call the police if
you dare to touch me.

1421
01:22:16,875 --> 01:22:17,833
Let's go.

1422
01:22:18,125 --> 01:22:19,291
Let's go. Come on.

1423
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:26,916
How many times will you humiliate me?

1424
01:22:27,958 --> 01:22:31,083
You played such a pathetic joke with me!

1425
01:22:32,666 --> 01:22:34,083
Get out of here.

1426
01:22:34,208 --> 01:22:35,041
Get lost.

1427
01:22:35,125 --> 01:22:37,125
Don't show me your face again.

1428
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:38,083
Get lost.

1429
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,291
Wait, Nabeel.

1430
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,333
How can you call it humiliation?

1431
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:49,458
He respected you
in front of his parents.

1432
01:22:51,416 --> 01:22:54,875
Aunt, when the heart is broken,

1433
01:22:55,041 --> 01:22:58,583
we fail to recognize the
most beautiful relationships in life.

1434
01:22:59,625 --> 01:23:01,875
He's come to you on his own.

1435
01:23:04,583 --> 01:23:05,958
Congratulations, Aunt.

1436
01:23:06,166 --> 01:23:07,333
You're a grandma now.

1437
01:23:08,041 --> 01:23:09,000
Yes.

1438
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:11,375
I am a grandma.

1439
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:13,208
Come here.

1440
01:23:13,791 --> 01:23:16,583
My dear grandson.

1441
01:23:18,125 --> 01:23:20,750
My grandson.

1442
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:27,125
Some idiot has rightly said Nabeel,

1443
01:23:27,541 --> 01:23:29,708
breaking of glass is a good omen.

1444
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:31,125
Right, Aunt?

1445
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:33,750
You came to meet that idiot.

1446
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:35,416
-Go.
-Oh yes.

1447
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:36,958
Wish me luck.

1448
01:23:40,583 --> 01:23:42,375
Won't you call me your bloody fool now?

1449
01:23:45,416 --> 01:23:48,583
For a second I thought
my calendar malfunctioned.

1450
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:52,875
I am sorry. I didn't know
you two were on a date.

1451
01:23:52,958 --> 01:23:54,250
What are you talking about?

1452
01:23:55,541 --> 01:23:58,708
Ms photographer packed
her bags and moved to Venice.

1453
01:23:59,041 --> 01:24:00,541
But Italy didn't suit her.

1454
01:24:00,791 --> 01:24:05,083
I returned to London this morning
and guess who I met at the airport.

1455
01:24:05,416 --> 01:24:06,291
Me.

1456
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:08,750
You know what?
You guys chill.

1457
01:24:08,833 --> 01:24:10,000
I'll come back some other day.

1458
01:24:10,083 --> 01:24:11,833
No, don't worry.

1459
01:24:12,083 --> 01:24:13,500
I'm going for a smoke anyway.

1460
01:24:13,625 --> 01:24:15,541
Hey, Anu, not in my room.

1461
01:24:15,666 --> 01:24:17,250
The smell remains for a long time.

1462
01:24:17,458 --> 01:24:19,125
Sorry.

1463
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:20,125
You know the rules.

1464
01:24:20,208 --> 01:24:21,083
Not sorry.

1465
01:24:21,583 --> 01:24:23,416
Rule breaker, heart breaker.

1466
01:24:29,625 --> 01:24:31,166
Do you still have this?

1467
01:24:31,333 --> 01:24:32,375
Of course.

1468
01:24:44,208 --> 01:24:46,458
Enough of this
"Tuesdays and Fridays", right?

1469
01:24:46,833 --> 01:24:48,625
-Enough of these rules.
-Exactly.

1470
01:24:49,291 --> 01:24:50,541
That's what I came to say.

1471
01:24:50,791 --> 01:24:51,666
Enough of it.

1472
01:24:51,791 --> 01:24:53,125
You can't do it anymore, right?

1473
01:24:53,875 --> 01:24:56,000
Let's end this. Right?

1474
01:24:59,666 --> 01:25:00,541
Right.

1475
01:25:00,791 --> 01:25:05,500
Look, whatever time we spent together,
it was amazing.

1476
01:25:05,583 --> 01:25:07,083
Like it really was.

1477
01:25:07,583 --> 01:25:12,583
But I still think I can't
give you what you want from me.

1478
01:25:12,958 --> 01:25:14,666
I am just not that guy.

1479
01:25:15,583 --> 01:25:21,166
Anyway, Anu and I were
thinking that we can…

1480
01:25:21,333 --> 01:25:22,791
get back together.

1481
01:25:22,958 --> 01:25:24,041
Seven weeks.

1482
01:25:24,958 --> 01:25:25,833
Yeah.

1483
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,625
But I wanted to ask you first.

1484
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:30,041
No, I mean…

1485
01:25:30,916 --> 01:25:32,541
It's a great idea, Varun.

1486
01:25:33,041 --> 01:25:35,333
Anu and you want the same thing.

1487
01:25:36,708 --> 01:25:38,916
And you know what, it's perfect timing.

1488
01:25:39,541 --> 01:25:42,000
My firm had given me two months leave

1489
01:25:42,291 --> 01:25:44,708
but they need me
to come back right now.

1490
01:25:44,791 --> 01:25:46,291
There's a lot of work.

1491
01:25:47,041 --> 01:25:50,125
I came to tell you that
I am going back to Mumbai.

1492
01:25:50,583 --> 01:25:51,458
Okay.

1493
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:54,333
So…

1494
01:25:57,750 --> 01:25:59,833
Varun. Pizza.

1495
01:26:01,125 --> 01:26:02,875
One second, I'll just come back.

1496
01:26:17,833 --> 01:26:23,541
<i>Pain of the distance between us</i>
<i>Will be unbearable</i>

1497
01:26:24,416 --> 01:26:27,041
<i>As you walk away</i>

1498
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:30,208
<i>You take my calm and peace</i>

1499
01:26:37,166 --> 01:26:43,000
<i>Pain of the distance between us</i>
<i>Will be unbearable</i>

1500
01:26:43,583 --> 01:26:49,000
<i>As you walk away</i>
<i>You take my calm and peace</i>

1501
01:26:49,958 --> 01:26:55,250
<i>A future of sleepless nights awaits me</i>

1502
01:26:55,333 --> 01:27:01,291
<i>My heart cries out with tears unseen</i>

1503
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:04,875
<i>My heart cries out</i>

1504
01:27:04,958 --> 01:27:08,166
<i>With tears unseen</i>

1505
01:27:08,416 --> 01:27:10,833
<i>My heart cries out</i>

1506
01:27:11,041 --> 01:27:14,208
<i>It won't stop</i>

1507
01:27:14,875 --> 01:27:19,916
<i>My heart cries out</i>

1508
01:27:20,333 --> 01:27:23,375
<i>Why did you walk away</i>

1509
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:26,458
<i>Oh, so callously?</i>

1510
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:29,625
<i>And took away the shine</i>

1511
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:33,041
<i>Of my moonlit streets?</i>

1512
01:27:33,125 --> 01:27:36,125
<i>Why did you walk away</i>

1513
01:27:36,208 --> 01:27:39,083
<i>Oh, so callously?</i>

1514
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:42,458
<i>And took away the shine</i>

1515
01:27:42,791 --> 01:27:46,791
<i>Of my moonlit streets?</i>

1516
01:28:06,625 --> 01:28:09,750
<i>This distance is not</i>

1517
01:28:09,833 --> 01:28:13,458
<i>What I expected</i>

1518
01:28:19,333 --> 01:28:25,083
<i>This distance is not what I expected</i>

1519
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:31,625
<i>These are excuses for selfishness</i>

1520
01:28:32,458 --> 01:28:38,416
<i>How do I tell you what I am sad about</i>

1521
01:28:38,541 --> 01:28:42,000
<i>I feel numb</i>

1522
01:28:42,083 --> 01:28:47,125
<i>Without you</i>

1523
01:28:47,416 --> 01:28:53,291
<i>My heart cries out with tears unseen</i>

1524
01:28:53,708 --> 01:28:59,708
<i>My heart cries out with tears unseen</i>

1525
01:29:00,083 --> 01:29:03,000
<i>My heart cries out</i>

1526
01:29:03,250 --> 01:29:06,666
<i>It won't stop</i>

1527
01:29:06,916 --> 01:29:10,166
<i>My heart cries out</i>

1528
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:11,166
Sia.

1529
01:29:11,958 --> 01:29:13,416
Rishi just proposed.

1530
01:29:13,625 --> 01:29:14,916
Is he moving to Mumbai?

1531
01:29:15,208 --> 01:29:18,083
No. I am moving to Pune.

1532
01:29:20,291 --> 01:29:22,208
He offered to move to Mumbai for me.

1533
01:29:22,333 --> 01:29:25,416
He was even ready to travel
to and fro from Pune for me.

1534
01:29:25,791 --> 01:29:29,166
But you know me.
That's all I wanted to hear from him.

1535
01:29:30,166 --> 01:29:32,583
I know you'll say that
I am compromising--

1536
01:29:32,666 --> 01:29:34,583
No! Not at all.

1537
01:29:34,875 --> 01:29:37,166
You're doing what's right for you.

1538
01:29:37,416 --> 01:29:39,291
I'm so happy for you, Pats.

1539
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:41,083
I know.

1540
01:29:41,208 --> 01:29:44,041
But, why are you forcing
yourself to smile?

1541
01:29:46,041 --> 01:29:47,625
I don't know.

1542
01:29:48,458 --> 01:29:49,666
It's been two months.

1543
01:29:49,916 --> 01:29:52,250
I should be done with
all this pathetic pining.

1544
01:29:52,833 --> 01:29:54,875
And anyway, what was I doing with him?

1545
01:29:55,291 --> 01:29:57,125
That's the problem with all the girls.

1546
01:29:57,291 --> 01:29:59,791
It's called the "Chandramukhi Complex".

1547
01:30:00,208 --> 01:30:04,791
I will change the guy
who no girl in the world could.

1548
01:30:05,208 --> 01:30:06,958
Oh, Sia.

1549
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:23,208
You know, Sia was
quite the ordinary kind.

1550
01:30:23,416 --> 01:30:24,625
It's good that you dumped her.

1551
01:30:24,875 --> 01:30:26,375
You deserve so much better.

1552
01:30:26,666 --> 01:30:27,583
Right?

1553
01:30:27,708 --> 01:30:29,916
You know what, she deserves better.

1554
01:30:30,541 --> 01:30:31,833
I wasn't right for her.

1555
01:30:32,083 --> 01:30:37,875
Yeah! It's because you feel all those
couples who stay together are crazy.

1556
01:30:38,083 --> 01:30:41,041
Like my mom and dad, Gaurav and me.

1557
01:30:41,708 --> 01:30:42,833
We're happy, right?

1558
01:30:43,083 --> 01:30:44,291
We'll see for how long.

1559
01:30:47,875 --> 01:30:49,416
Kaju, you know what I mean!

1560
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:51,125
I know exactly what you mean, Varun.

1561
01:30:51,583 --> 01:30:55,916
Do you think you don't hurt
anyone with your seven week circus?

1562
01:30:56,791 --> 01:31:00,458
Apologizing before making a mistake
doesn't make it any less of a mistake.

1563
01:31:00,833 --> 01:31:01,708
Okay?

1564
01:31:02,583 --> 01:31:03,541
I don't know.

1565
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,791
Maybe it's your charming looks,
or maybe you're good in bed.

1566
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:11,000
That's why all your
girlfriends use you and leave.

1567
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:12,958
No one takes you seriously.

1568
01:31:13,041 --> 01:31:15,333
And I don't want anyone
to take me seriously.

1569
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:17,333
Oh, really?

1570
01:31:18,208 --> 01:31:22,000
You're afraid, Varun that you
might start taking someone seriously.

1571
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:24,791
Why else would you lie to Sia?

1572
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,458
That Anu and you are back together.

1573
01:31:28,541 --> 01:31:29,541
Do you know why?

1574
01:31:30,291 --> 01:31:34,583
Because Sia managed to
do what no other girls could.

1575
01:31:35,458 --> 01:31:36,416
You are afraid

1576
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:39,000
of her and her love.

1577
01:31:39,125 --> 01:31:40,750
I am afraid of myself!

1578
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,291
I love her, dammit.

1579
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:45,666
I love her.

1580
01:31:50,541 --> 01:31:53,291
Dad didn't just leave mom.
He left me as well.

1581
01:31:53,958 --> 01:31:56,375
I haven't just seen
pain but felt it as well.

1582
01:31:56,666 --> 01:32:00,500
And I don't want someone else to
feel this pain because of me.

1583
01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:02,208
You're wrong, Varun.

1584
01:32:04,625 --> 01:32:06,500
Your father didn't leave us.

1585
01:32:13,708 --> 01:32:16,625
This NGO belongs to your father.

1586
01:32:17,041 --> 01:32:19,333
I wanted to shut it down.

1587
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,958
And one day out of rage, I said that…

1588
01:32:23,791 --> 01:32:25,291
this is just an excuse

1589
01:32:25,666 --> 01:32:28,166
to be surrounded by so many women.

1590
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:32,000
And the girl I accused him
of having an affair with…

1591
01:32:34,125 --> 01:32:36,541
tried to kill herself.

1592
01:32:37,625 --> 01:32:40,166
That's when he couldn't forgive me.

1593
01:32:47,708 --> 01:32:48,958
But before leaving…

1594
01:32:49,708 --> 01:32:53,833
he entrusted me with the
thing he loved the most.

1595
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:56,750
You.

1596
01:32:58,083 --> 01:33:00,083
When you didn't say anything
for all these years…

1597
01:33:02,041 --> 01:33:03,208
then, why say it now?

1598
01:33:03,666 --> 01:33:07,791
I lost him because
of speaking up that day…

1599
01:33:08,458 --> 01:33:12,958
and now I didn't want
to lose you by keeping quiet.

1600
01:33:13,458 --> 01:33:16,458
You won't be yourself without Sia.

1601
01:33:52,291 --> 01:33:53,625
Can we meet tomorrow?

1602
01:33:55,125 --> 01:33:56,041
Please.

1603
01:34:05,916 --> 01:34:06,750
Hi.

1604
01:34:10,083 --> 01:34:11,708
I didn't think you would show up.

1605
01:34:11,916 --> 01:34:13,250
I cannot say no to a patient.

1606
01:34:13,916 --> 01:34:14,916
Medical ethics.

1607
01:34:15,291 --> 01:34:17,125
I didn't call you here for therapy.

1608
01:34:17,375 --> 01:34:19,541
Out of all the psychiatrists in London,

1609
01:34:20,125 --> 01:34:21,583
you called up the mother…

1610
01:34:22,708 --> 01:34:24,291
whose daughter's heart you broke.

1611
01:34:24,833 --> 01:34:27,500
So that she can help you
because you are heartbroken.

1612
01:34:28,708 --> 01:34:30,291
And you say you don't need therapy?

1613
01:34:30,541 --> 01:34:34,833
I want to talk to Sia's mom
and not Dr. Radhika Malhotra.

1614
01:34:35,958 --> 01:34:36,958
I want to apologize.

1615
01:34:37,416 --> 01:34:38,750
Apologize to Sia.

1616
01:34:40,625 --> 01:34:42,416
And if you expect her to forgive you…

1617
01:34:43,416 --> 01:34:45,000
then learn to forgive yourself.

1618
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
You know what my mom did.

1619
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:50,166
What did she do?

1620
01:34:51,125 --> 01:34:53,708
She kept quiet all these
years with the fear of losing you.

1621
01:34:54,541 --> 01:34:56,791
And now she spoke up
because of the same fear.

1622
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:00,000
Isn't 22-years of punishment enough?

1623
01:35:08,958 --> 01:35:10,000
Will you eat something?

1624
01:35:11,875 --> 01:35:12,791
No.

1625
01:35:57,666 --> 01:35:59,666
WELCOME TO PAYAL TRIPATHI'S HENNA FUNCTION

1626
01:36:00,083 --> 01:36:01,416
Where the heck is Rishi?

1627
01:36:04,833 --> 01:36:07,541
I mean, where is he?

1628
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:09,416
Now, look.

1629
01:36:09,916 --> 01:36:11,416
Doesn't this look nice?

1630
01:36:12,958 --> 01:36:14,375
Come on. It's your turn now.

1631
01:36:15,291 --> 01:36:16,375
Go ahead, Sia.

1632
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:19,541
Ms. Channo is lucky for everyone.

1633
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:24,041
I don't believe in these things.

1634
01:36:39,916 --> 01:36:41,083
I am done applying the henna.

1635
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:43,000
What? That was quick!

1636
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:47,250
Actually, Ms. Channo needs time.

1637
01:36:47,625 --> 01:36:49,791
So, I thought we'll get
your feet done in the meantime.

1638
01:36:50,166 --> 01:36:51,166
I'll get it done as well.

1639
01:36:52,458 --> 01:36:53,416
I'll be right back.

1640
01:36:54,291 --> 01:36:55,333
Pats.

1641
01:36:57,791 --> 01:36:59,583
Hurry up, please.

1642
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,541
What's the hurry, Sia?

1643
01:37:17,791 --> 01:37:18,625
Finally!

1644
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:20,166
Do you know how long I kept her here?

1645
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:21,583
My love, the highway was jammed.

1646
01:37:21,666 --> 01:37:23,958
We were done putting
henna on her hands and feet.

1647
01:37:24,041 --> 01:37:25,583
The only place left was her hair.

1648
01:37:26,083 --> 01:37:27,500
That's enough.

1649
01:37:27,625 --> 01:37:29,333
The producers called up again.

1650
01:37:30,916 --> 01:37:33,416
They still want to
change the film's end.

1651
01:37:33,541 --> 01:37:35,041
Aren't you ashamed?

1652
01:37:35,625 --> 01:37:37,458
Have you come here for legal advice?

1653
01:37:37,708 --> 01:37:39,333
No, I…

1654
01:37:40,125 --> 01:37:41,791
I changed the end, Sia.

1655
01:37:42,541 --> 01:37:44,041
She doesn't leave him.

1656
01:37:44,375 --> 01:37:45,541
She fights for him.

1657
01:37:46,125 --> 01:37:47,875
Like you did for me.

1658
01:37:48,291 --> 01:37:50,541
-Ms. Channo, let it be.
-It's almost done.

1659
01:37:50,916 --> 01:37:54,958
I didn't realize that love never comes
with a 100% guarantee of happiness.

1660
01:37:57,083 --> 01:37:58,583
But this is the only way to love.

1661
01:37:59,125 --> 01:38:00,416
It happens wholeheartedly.

1662
01:38:01,333 --> 01:38:02,791
You cannot put conditions on love.

1663
01:38:02,875 --> 01:38:05,208
You learnt that from my mom, right?

1664
01:38:05,625 --> 01:38:06,833
Yeah, but…

1665
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:08,708
what I am trying to say is that…

1666
01:38:09,208 --> 01:38:10,625
when the heart is broken,

1667
01:38:11,166 --> 01:38:13,958
we're unable to recognize
the most beautiful relationships.

1668
01:38:14,333 --> 01:38:16,625
And you learnt that from aunt.

1669
01:38:17,125 --> 01:38:18,875
Yes, but how do you know?

1670
01:38:19,291 --> 01:38:22,375
Because I said that
to aunt about Nabeel.

1671
01:38:22,583 --> 01:38:23,500
Oh.

1672
01:38:23,958 --> 01:38:25,208
What kind of a writer are you?

1673
01:38:25,458 --> 01:38:27,166
You're saying someone else' lines.

1674
01:38:27,583 --> 01:38:29,416
Don't you have something
of your own to say?

1675
01:38:29,583 --> 01:38:30,458
It's done.

1676
01:38:30,958 --> 01:38:32,041
Thank you.

1677
01:38:36,625 --> 01:38:37,500
Help me.

1678
01:38:37,625 --> 01:38:39,166
Yeah, sure. Sorry.

1679
01:38:46,083 --> 01:38:49,500
Sia Malhotra, will you please be my date?

1680
01:38:50,666 --> 01:38:54,125
For every Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.

1681
01:38:56,041 --> 01:38:57,708
Shall we keep the weekends off?

1682
01:38:58,291 --> 01:38:59,166
What?

1683
01:38:59,708 --> 01:39:00,625
Kidding.

1684
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,666
Will you please marry me?

1685
01:39:10,666 --> 01:39:11,500
No.

1686
01:39:19,250 --> 01:39:23,583
What if you change your mind
after seven-weeks of being married?

1687
01:39:24,166 --> 01:39:25,791
Sia, I…

1688
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,125
-I--
-Fifty two weeks.

1689
01:39:27,875 --> 01:39:28,750
What now?

1690
01:39:29,041 --> 01:39:30,208
52 weeks.

1691
01:39:30,625 --> 01:39:31,500
One year.

1692
01:39:31,916 --> 01:39:33,166
What after a year?

1693
01:39:34,041 --> 01:39:37,666
If we're still together after a year,
you can propose again.

1694
01:39:37,875 --> 01:39:40,166
But you'll accept my proposal, right?

1695
01:39:41,958 --> 01:39:42,833
If you're lucky.

1696
01:39:46,416 --> 01:39:50,083
<i>If you want to meet me</i>
<i>Make a wedding card</i>

1697
01:39:50,166 --> 01:39:53,666
<i>I'm a straight talker</i>
<i>No hard feelings</i>

1698
01:39:53,875 --> 01:39:56,458
<i>I will curse you</i>
<i>I will curse you</i>

1699
01:39:56,541 --> 01:39:58,375
Pats moved to Pune for Rishi.

1700
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:01,083
And Sia found a new roommate.
Varun.

1701
01:40:01,166 --> 01:40:04,916
<i>If you want to meet me</i>
<i>Make a wedding card</i>

1702
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:08,083
Yeah, Varun moved to Mumbai for Sia.

1703
01:40:08,166 --> 01:40:09,208
And, why wouldn't he?

1704
01:40:09,333 --> 01:40:11,458
Varun can work anywhere.

1705
01:40:11,541 --> 01:40:14,625
But Sia's life is in Mumbai.

1706
01:40:14,833 --> 01:40:15,791
Anyway…

1707
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,708
why should a girl leave her home?

1708
01:40:19,041 --> 01:40:20,833
I know, dear.
But why are you telling me this?

1709
01:40:21,166 --> 01:40:23,208
-Even I--
-Yes, you did.

1710
01:40:24,416 --> 01:40:26,625
If they have an argument…

1711
01:40:26,708 --> 01:40:28,916
Varun will not have to sleep on the sofa.

1712
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:33,875
<i>Let's go relish some tangy snacks</i>

1713
01:40:34,166 --> 01:40:37,583
<i>One more, love?</i>
<i>What say, my love?</i>

1714
01:40:37,833 --> 01:40:41,041
<i>One more, love?</i>
<i>Ready to get stuffed, my love?</i>

1715
01:40:49,125 --> 01:40:52,791
<i>You can't claim him, mom-in-law</i>
<i>He's all mine now</i>

1716
01:40:52,916 --> 01:40:56,500
<i>He was your boy</i>
<i>When he was wearing diapers</i>

1717
01:40:56,625 --> 01:41:00,208
<i>He was mine</i>
<i>When he started wearing Jockey</i>

1718
01:41:00,333 --> 01:41:03,958
<i>You can't claim him, mom-in-law</i>
<i>He's all mine now</i>

1719
01:41:04,083 --> 01:41:07,541
<i>He asked for hugs and kisses</i>

1720
01:41:07,625 --> 01:41:11,041
<i>He promised to take me to London</i>

1721
01:41:11,375 --> 01:41:14,958
<i>I am no less</i>

1722
01:41:15,041 --> 01:41:18,458
<i>My attitude is sure to impress</i>

1723
01:41:18,791 --> 01:41:22,333
<i>He said skip the traditional wear</i>

1724
01:41:22,583 --> 01:41:25,625
<i>And show up in a mini dress instead</i>
<i>My honey bear</i>

1725
01:41:25,708 --> 01:41:29,333
A year later, Sia finally said, "yes."

1726
01:41:30,208 --> 01:41:32,916
<i>One more, love?</i>
<i>What say, my love?</i>

1727
01:41:33,916 --> 01:41:35,791
We gave the priest a solitary instruction.

1728
01:41:36,125 --> 01:41:37,541
We told him that the wedding date
doesn't matter to us.

1729
01:41:37,625 --> 01:41:39,958
-It only matters if the day is Tuesday--
-Or Friday.
