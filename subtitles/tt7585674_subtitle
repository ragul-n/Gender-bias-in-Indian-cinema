00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,375
Hello, friends.

3
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:32,750
I am Monika, live from
Living India News Channel.

4
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:37,083
As you can see,
we are in a beautiful village of Punjab.

5
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:41,458
Like Southall in the UK
is considered as the Mini Punjab,

6
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:46,791
similarly, this village in Punjab
is known as Mini America.

7
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,750
It's because two thirds of the people
from here are well settled

8
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,958
with big mansions of Punjab...

9
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,750
the clean roads,

10
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,625
filled with imported goods

11
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,625
and imported cars.

12
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,916
This is what he gave me.

13
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:09,708
-Guddi.
-Yes.

14
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:10,708
He said that

15
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:14,333
whenever I wish to talk to him,
I should "ping" him.

16
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,583
Someone tell him

17
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:21,583
that if I can't handle a phone properly,
then how can I handle a computer?

18
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,333
He wants me to "ping" him.

19
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,750
I don't know what black magic

20
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:43,000
she has done on my son.

21
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,500
It has been five years.

22
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:49,250
Neither he has come
nor has he sent my grandsons.

23
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:53,375
That witch has given such weird names
to my grandsons.

24
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,541
Cha Singh, Shoo Singh.

25
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,500
What kind of names are those?

26
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,791
We visited the entire village.

27
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,208
Now let's talk to seniors sitting here.

28
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,291
-Uncle?
-Yes.

29
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,333
I have toured the whole village.

30
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,375
I didn't see a single young man.

31
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,333
-Can I ask something?
-Go ahead.

32
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:19,041
Is there any young man left
in this village?

33
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,750
There is, dear.

34
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,291
There is one young man.

35
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:26,625
Yes.

36
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,875
Mann's son. Major German Singh Mann.

37
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,958
So he has a big post in the army!

38
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,125
Oh.

39
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,208
German, don't ruin it
with the over practicing.

40
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,083
Here's your file.
It's time for the interview.

41
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,833
I think you didn't hear it, daddy.

42
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,791
Oh my! My son talks so well in English!

43
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,041
Bless me!

44
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,041
What's happening?

45
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:47,958
Myself Major Ger... Uh...

46
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,791
Not England, Major! What's this nonsense!

47
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,333
This won't help you.

48
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,541
It is so difficult to lie.

49
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
My name is...

50
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:04,458
-I am working...
-Very good, Mr. Khan.

51
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,416
Be confident. Don't be scared of anything.

52
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,500
Talk with confidence.
You are good in English.

53
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,083
I understood.

54
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,166
Talk in English.

55
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,208
Stick to English. That's it.

56
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,583
As you wish. Don't mess up.

57
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,291
So what if you didn't get England's visa?

58
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,166
We still aren't out of countries or money.

59
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,916
We will try some other place.

60
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,875
For now, only his visa application
is being rejected.

61
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,458
In a few years, his marriage proposals
will also get rejected.

62
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:37,583
He might end up with getting neither
the meat nor the milk

63
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,291
from the goat.

64
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,708
Stop blabbering.

65
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,916
Teja has gone to England when he was 26.

66
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,750
He got married when he was 28.

67
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,416
My son got late because he was studying.

68
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,291
You need to have some change
in the pocket to get the visa.

69
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,750
You cannot make money without
having some money of your own.

70
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,458
Aunt, I am starving.
Please serve me dinner.

71
00:08:56,916 --> 00:09:00,000
Sister-in-law, you shouldn't be so proud
of your money.

72
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,083
My son too will go abroad.

73
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:03,958
Otherwise, change my name.

74
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,250
Why are you getting upset, big brother?

75
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,250
She has a habit of joking.

76
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,333
I am not joking.

77
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:14,041
I suggest that you find a nice place
and get him married.

78
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,833
I cannot cook for everyone every day.

79
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,375
I want to get rid of them.

80
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:26,791
Okay then!

81
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,416
You just wait and watch, sister-in-law.

82
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:34,583
I'll have the most beautiful
daughter-in-law in the village.

83
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,958
German, get up!

84
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,333
-Let's go!
-Brother!

85
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,458
You didn't get the visa?
But you were very good in English.

86
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,458
Let me tell you the real reason.

87
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,125
These Englishmen don't like us.

88
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,791
It's not the fault of our English.
I am very good in English.

89
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:44,416
Damn you, Shahid Khan!
You got my visa rejected!

90
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,791
Well done, Major.

91
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,250
You have hit the jackpot this time.

92
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,833
An Indian girl as your visa officer.

93
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,166
What's your name, dear?

94
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:41,666
Hey, you are a Punjabi!
Forget that, you are a relative!

95
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,291
You know my aunt, Baljeet?
She is married to a Khanna.

96
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,583
They live in the Cable lane.

97
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,375
Where do you stay in Khanna?

98
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,375
I am from Delhi. Khanna is my surname.

99
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,208
Delhi isn't far away either.

100
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:57,708
If there is no traffic, it's just
seven hours away, give or take.

101
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,916
Don't tire yourself.

102
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,416
I'll come over there and give them to you.

103
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,458
Stay there.

104
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,458
Your name is quite interesting.

105
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,541
It is not interesting. It is troublesome.

106
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:20,291
While filling forms, I run out of space
before my name ends.

107
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,375
You know what happened?

108
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,500
My grandfather wanted to make me a Major.

109
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,375
And my father wanted to send me
to Germany.

110
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,208
And Mann is our caste.

111
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:31,000
I have taken four interviews till now.

112
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,500
All four of them made fake documents
to get a visa.

113
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,083
But I am pleased to meet
an honest person like you.

114
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,000
Let's begin the interview.

115
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,458
Look Sonia, honestly speaking,

116
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,083
if you give me the visa...

117
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:09,000
-I won't be coming back from England.
-Really?

118
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,458
But I can give you
a visa only for 15 days.

119
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,333
What will I do with a 15-day visa?

120
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:16,125
Look, the flight itself
is eight hours long.

121
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:21,000
It takes around two hours to get out of
the airport, including toilet break.

122
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:24,583
So in total I need a 12-hour visa.

123
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,125
I won't come back.

124
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,458
Then what about your 100 acres of land?

125
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,750
I have added an extra zero to it.
I have only 10 acres.

126
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,625
Ten acres is a lot.
You can get a car in the dowry.

127
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,500
But I am not into dowries and all.

128
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,916
I want to go abroad.
Please give me the visa.

129
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,583
It was a pleasure to meet you.

130
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,541
Sonia, just because I am going abroad...

131
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,958
it doesn't mean that our story ends here.

132
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,916
You can write your address
and your phone number

133
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,250
on the last page of the file.

134
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,833
I promise I will call you
once I go abroad.

135
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,166
I always keep my promises. That is true.

136
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,166
She isn't with me.

137
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,583
My father has come with me.
He is waiting downstairs.

138
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,958
Did I get the visa?

139
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,166
You give it to me so quickly.

140
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:09,625
This is the benefit of being a Punjabi.

141
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,416
He is trying for England.

142
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,208
It would be great if he pulls through.

143
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,583
Father, come with me.

144
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,291
Shall I book the tickets?

145
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,791
Yes, to go back to the village.

146
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,666
I will be stupid to think
about going abroad again.

147
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,916
Brother, I have to go abroad at any cost.

148
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,166
Let's try once again.

149
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:33,833
Let me tell you, you have no hope left.

150
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,583
-Boota.
-No, you won't get it.

151
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,833
-Boota.
-It's impossible. Go away.

152
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,000
You won't get it.

153
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,250
-You. Listen.
-You listen to me.

154
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:44,625
Boota, why don't send him to Germany?

155
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:48,291
Uncle, his visa application for Germany
has already been rejected three times.

156
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,833
I think this time embassy
will stamp abuses on his passport.

157
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,416
Will that be fine?

158
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:58,791
Boota, do they also teach a song
or something inside, before the interview?

159
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,625
Uncle, they don't interrogate
for murder in there.

160
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,375
He has a bad habit of telling the truth.

161
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:04,666
Tell me something.

162
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,125
Why doesn't he say what's written
in the file?

163
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,750
Son, it will be a huge favor.

164
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:12,958
Do something about him.

165
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,208
Otherwise,
his aunt will laugh at both of us.

166
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,583
Sir, people laugh at me.

167
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,333
There was a Visa, but your dearest played

168
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,833
He played with my reputation
Boota please do.

169
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,833
Help me, brother.

170
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,458
I swear, I won't tell the truth.

171
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:34,833
I will lie so much that even criminal
shows will make a feature on me.

172
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,000
Okay then.

173
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,875
It will cost you 350,000 rupees.

174
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,250
Okay, sir?

175
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Your job will be done.

176
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,541
GURU RAKHA BIRTHDAY

00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,291
TO BOOK A PROGRAM GIVE
US A MISSED CALL ON 9814569677

178
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,083
What is this nonsense!

179
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,875
You should have come in a car
or something.

180
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,875
Nowadays even eunuchs come in cars.

181
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,958
At least take my reputation
into consideration.

182
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,875
-I came here quite often.
-Hello, brother.

183
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,166
This baby elephant is very lucky for us.

184
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,333
And listen.

185
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,041
Don't underestimate me.

186
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,000
I have done four tours in Malaysia.

187
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,291
Principal in the school of idiots.

188
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,458
Which dog was listening to you
in Malaysia?

189
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,208
You guys are worse than me.

190
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,750
Stubborn monkeys. Let's go.

191
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,000
Hey!

192
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:54,083
Major?

193
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,125
Let me talk to them, okay?

194
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,333
I will do all the talking.

195
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,208
You just sit with your mouth sealed.

196
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,416
Or don't sit.

197
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,791
Still I will do all the talking.

198
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,500
This isn't a classroom.

199
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,833
We will first interview you.

200
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,708
Then if Mr. Wilson wants,
we will also test your music skills.

201
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,458
Mr. Wilson wants to know
when did you guys meet?

202
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,208
We just met outside, in the parking.

203
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:57,166
He means today we met in the parking.

204
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,333
We have known each other
for the past 10 to 15 years.

205
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,625
Yes.

206
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,875
How many shows you have in England?

207
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,291
Four.

208
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,625
You didn't look at this.

209
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,833
Okay! Four.

210
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,416
You please come this way.

211
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,458
He will take us down.

212
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,958
How much are you being paid for this trip?

213
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,000
-3,000.
-300,000.

214
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,333
He said 300,000 per show.

215
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,958
This is bad. He pays us only 3,000.

216
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,166
Drag them out.

217
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:09,250
Hit him! Hit him!

218
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,250
You ruined it for us!

219
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,833
Please don't hit me.

220
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,750
We got a chance to perform
in England with great difficulty.

221
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,791
They are hitting him.

222
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,208
They are hitting him.

223
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,416
Save him. You need his help.

224
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,500
I'll pay a hit man to get rid of you.

225
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,166
You are a fraud.

226
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,500
Go! Come on.

227
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:40,625
The police is here!

228
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,916
Police! Police! The police is here!

229
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,375
Run! Run!

230
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,041
Boota, please listen to me.

231
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,541
Listen to me! Get out of my office!

232
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,625
Otherwise, I'll hire goons to beat you up.

233
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,541
Listen, son

234
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:19,708
Once my son boards the plane,
you can take the money you want.

235
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,458
Uncle, I don't want your money.

236
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,583
Hello, PT teacher for monkeys.

237
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,083
My father didn't say 1.2 million.

238
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,666
Shut up. I don't want to talk to you.

239
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,250
Uncle, you were talking
about 1.2 to 1.4 million.

240
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,875
Okay, you can take 1.4 million.

241
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,708
But I like my respect more than money.

242
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:37,916
Okay then, 1.5 million.

243
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,041
No.

244
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:42,916
Listen Boota, 1.7 million, final!
That's it.

245
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,208
-How much did you say?
-1.7 million.

246
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,458
1.7 million?

247
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,583
You are making a bad deal, father.

248
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,458
Look at his face.
Does he deserve to get 1.7 million?

249
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,250
Shut your mouth. Aunt, sorry, uncle.

250
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,291
Respect can be earned again.

251
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,541
One never knows when one gets
a chance to make 1.7 million again.

252
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,291
How can German not go aboard
when I am here?

253
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:06,958
Shame on me and my office!
Start making preparations.

254
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,458
-Will it work?
-It will.

255
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:12,333
Of course it will, Mr. Mann.
Do one thing. Lift your hand.

256
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,000
No, put that hand down. Yes.

257
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,916
This one like this. Close your eyes.

258
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,708
When I say three, you use it.

259
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,708
-Use what?
-The deadly weapon.

260
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,041
One, two, three.

261
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,708
Oh, you can do it.

262
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,208
<i>A girl who is a citizen</i>
<i>of England will come here.</i>

263
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:40,333
<i>She will do a fake wedding with you</i>

264
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:44,541
<i>and she will fly back to England</i>
<i>with you just like an eagle.</i>

265
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,083
This parcel from England
is really extra large.

266
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,666
That eagle will kill this mouse.

267
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,666
Let's go. Here's the board.

268
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,916
Where are we going?

269
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:07,625
Boota has asked me not to talk to you.
You should go and talk to him.

270
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,833
Which idiot Boota are you talking about?
I don't know any such person.

271
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:11,625
Look, he might be an idiot
but he is my brother.

272
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:12,583
I cannot say anything.

273
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,291
-You talk to him.
-Wait.

274
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,291
My name isn't Geet. It's Komal.

275
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:21,375
With the heavy hand you have,
your name should be King Kong.

276
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:03,291
Here we are.

277
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:05,000
-You have come to pick us up?
-Why?

278
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,958
Are you my father's brother-in-law's son
who I've come to pick up?

279
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:10,958
-Move aside.
-Why did you taking the longer route?

280
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:12,666
Couldn't you say uncle's son instead?

281
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:14,250
You have come to pick me up?

282
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:18,666
If I had been so lucky,
I'd have gone to Germany three years ago.

283
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,291
Idiot, then why are you holding a board
with my name on it?

284
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:22,708
I am Geet.

285
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:25,958
Get my bags. Listen to him talk!

286
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:29,125
-Which one of them is your bag?
-The red one.

287
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:34,291
My name is Lakkha Jhol.

288
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,083
One in a million, Lakkha.

289
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,083
You don't know me.

290
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:41,291
Idiot! Who is he?

291
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:42,916
How does it concern you? Let's go.

292
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,833
Oh my God! She is so beautiful.

293
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:02,500
-How did she agree to marry German?
-Shut up.

294
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,208
God bless you, son.

295
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:06,750
Be well, my son.

296
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:09,833
Congratulations, German.

297
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:11,541
Who is he?

298
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,083
The middleman.

299
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:14,708
This tiny one is the middleman?

300
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:18,291
Son, you should wear decent clothes
for the wedding.

301
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:21,791
We took 1.7 million from you.

302
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:24,083
But that doesn't mean
that even old wrecks insult me.

303
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:26,458
He is the one paying1.7 million.

304
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,708
He doesn't look like
he can pay 1.7 million.

305
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:31,958
And listen. This isn't our first wedding.

306
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:33,041
Okay, but it is my first wedding.

307
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:34,541
Come with me.

308
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:37,333
-Here, brother. Have some sweets.
-Congratulations.

309
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:38,625
Take this, sister-in-law.
Have some sweets.

310
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:41,083
Make sure your blood sugar
has been checked.

311
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:47,208
Did you look at the girl?
She is so beautiful.

312
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:51,125
I don't understand how
did she agree to marry German?

313
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:52,625
You keep your mouth shut.

314
00:24:57,916 --> 00:24:59,791
I thought everything
has already been discussed

315
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,750
but there is nothing like
having a face-to-face conversation.

316
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:05,125
Tell me, I am listening.

317
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:08,333
You won't believe it, but I cannot lie.

318
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:12,083
It might be a fake wedding
but my desires are real.

319
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:15,125
My aunt is about to have a heart attack.

320
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:17,708
And there is commotion in the village.
You just don't ask.

321
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:19,750
She doesn't need to ask.
You are saying everything on your own.

322
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:25,625
Well, I had come to give this money.

323
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:27,500
I have already given 500,000 to Boota.

324
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:29,125
And I have given you 300,000 earlier.

325
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:30,541
And here's another 300,000.

326
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:32,750
I'll give the rest once I go abroad.

327
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,083
Give it to me as soon as we reach England

328
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:38,208
or else I won't sign
on the citizenship report.

329
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:42,000
Your height and your attitude match.

330
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:43,666
What do you mean?

331
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:46,166
Straightforward, like a stick.

332
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,000
Don't get beaten up by a stick.

333
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:49,708
You are getting married tomorrow.
Go and dance.

334
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:52,041
Listen, brother.

335
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:55,875
I am ready to pay 2.7
instead of 1.7 million.

336
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,458
Can this fake wedding
turn into a real one?

337
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,500
Cutting the cake and having it too?

338
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:03,541
Don't lose the cake because of your greed.

339
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:05,125
She is very hot-tempered.

340
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:09,958
What was he saying?

341
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:12,291
He said there is no commode
in the bathroom.

342
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:15,291
I said it's not a big deal.
We will manage.

343
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,666
Dust the sheets before you spread them.

344
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,583
Arrange the chairs.
Go and keep the sofa in my room.

345
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:30,750
German!

346
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:34,000
Yes, father?

347
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:38,166
Son, what if our lie gets caught?

348
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:40,125
No, father. Don't worry.

349
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:42,916
I will turn this lie
into the truth in a few days.

350
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:46,541
And your son likes
your fake daughter-in-law.

351
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:47,791
God bless you.

352
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:50,875
-I'll go and meet the cook.
-We are there.

353
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:53,375
-Yes.
-There you go.

354
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:55,458
-Get down.
-Major!

355
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:59,291
-Yes, uncle?
-All good?

356
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:01,625
Yes, uncle. All good!

357
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:05,666
-What brings you here?
-Hey!

358
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:09,416
Everyone in the village
is talking about German's wedding.

359
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,041
I thought I should go and inquire.

360
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:14,333
I heard that you are getting married
to a citizen of England?

361
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:17,000
-I swear, I don't believe it.
-Why?

362
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:20,416
Are you my wife's uncle that
I need to convince you to get married?

363
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:22,791
And what do you mean by inquire?

364
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:24,833
Oh no, let's see.

365
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,708
Hey, this means it is true.

366
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:37,208
Bitto, she is wearing hot pants.

367
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:38,958
I find her to be hot.

368
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,458
She agreed to marry German?

369
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,666
I swear, I don't believe it.

370
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:55,416
No, I didn't see anything.

371
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,500
Get this straight.

372
00:27:57,958 --> 00:28:00,166
Before I thrash you
in front of the whole village,

373
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:04,750
go near that wall, eat some fritters
with green chutney and leave.

374
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:06,041
One more thing.

375
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:07,541
Don't eat cottage cheese fritters.

376
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:08,916
You can have the cauliflower fritters.

377
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,250
Cottage cheese fritters
are for my relatives.

378
00:28:10,416 --> 00:28:11,291
Go.

379
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:12,833
Let's go, Bitto.

380
00:28:12,916 --> 00:28:14,625
-Take him along.
-Hmm.

381
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:15,666
Go.

382
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:18,083
German.

383
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:25,666
German, I was wondering,
your family will be the bride's in-laws.

384
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,958
So you should send the girl to our place.

385
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,833
We'll be her maternal family
and your family could be her in-laws.

386
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,041
Why are you in such a hurry, aunt?

387
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:34,291
We are getting married tomorrow.

388
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:37,625
We both will be there.
You can look at her every day.

389
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,375
No, I was just wondering,
she came all by herself.

390
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,250
Where is her family?

391
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:48,083
We still haven't started serving lunch.

392
00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:49,625
Do you know who I am?

393
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:52,708
How should I know?
Are you the bride's father?

394
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:54,083
-Yes, I am.
-Get lost.

395
00:28:57,458 --> 00:28:59,291
Hey, serve me some more fritters.

396
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:01,458
This is my daughter's in-law's house.

397
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,625
Where will I eat, if not here?

398
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,500
What are you saying?

399
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:07,666
How can girls get married
without their parents?

400
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,083
-Come here!
-Get this straight!

401
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,000
I will start protesting right here!
Let me warn you.

402
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:12,958
-Get lost!
-You!

403
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:15,083
Come here.
Come here. Come here. Come here.

404
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:18,208
Boota, you better talk to the waiter.
Otherwise, I'll teach him a lesson.

405
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:20,166
Enough, try to understand.

406
00:29:21,416 --> 00:29:23,291
Son, the girl is so beautiful.

407
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:24,833
Her face doesn't match
with her father at all.

408
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:27,916
Yes, she has taken after her mother.

409
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,041
Look how beautiful she is.

410
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:31,458
As if her mother is Madhuri Dixit.

411
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:34,083
Their complexion is bad.

412
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:36,208
Sister, it is not easy to earn pounds.

413
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:38,291
You have to lose your heart
and your color. Right?

414
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:40,791
Sister-in-law,
what are you doing over here?

415
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,833
-Go and make tea for the guests.
-Yes.

416
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,458
Where did you get these oldies from?

417
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:48,833
You should have brought some
decent looking parents for her.

418
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:51,791
Mr. Mann,
they are hard working decent people.

419
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,625
And he is also the head
of the labor union.

420
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,000
I don't want him to sit for protests.

421
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:57,250
Look at his face.
Does he look like my father-in-law?

422
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:59,458
He looks like Chris Gayle's father-in-law.

423
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:03,291
Boota, the father-in-law can be ignored.

424
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,875
But at least the mother-in-law
should be decent looking.

425
00:30:06,291 --> 00:30:07,375
-I am leaving then.
-Wait.

426
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:09,500
Stop it, father. Don't interrupt.

427
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:13,166
What stop it? One has a right
to joke after being two pegs down.

428
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,041
You can drink three and joke with me.
Leave them alone.

429
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:18,500
Son, we deserve to get rings
as a wedding gift.

430
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,666
Don't make me stuff your mouth
with a gold bangle.

431
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:23,541
Not the mouth, it's worn on the wrist.

432
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:25,041
This one is stuffed in the mouth.

433
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:27,041
Ignore this greedy man, son.

434
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:29,958
But do pay us
before we leave in the evening.

435
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:31,333
You will get your pay, aunt.

436
00:30:31,416 --> 00:30:32,375
But you have to keep two things in mind.

437
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:35,458
-What?
-You don't take any parcels when leaving.

438
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:38,125
And you will open your mouth only to eat.

439
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:39,333
All your replies should be
just in murmurs.

440
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:40,666
And get this straight, Boota.

441
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,375
Make sure they dress well.

442
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:43,958
-Understood?
-Okay. Done.

443
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:44,916
-Take them away.
-Okay.

444
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,791
-Let's go, father.
-Let's go. You shouldn't talk too much.

445
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:47,916
Let's go.

446
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,125
Geet.

447
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:56,625
I have a condition.

448
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:00,750
Oh really? You have that right?

449
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:02,708
Lakkha!

450
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:06,750
What is it, Geet?
Did he say something? Yes?

451
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:08,541
He is putting conditions on me.

452
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:11,208
No, I said it by mistake
thinking about the wedding.

453
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:12,875
It isn't my condition. It is my request.

454
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:15,375
Tell her to wear decent clothes
while she is in this village.

455
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:16,833
Why? Do these clothes cause trouble?

456
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,958
No, but she can at least try
to dress decently.

457
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:21,750
She is from England. She isn't from here.

458
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,583
Tomorrow, you will also want her
to clean the floor.

459
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:29,375
You know that here girls wear such clothes
only when playing badminton.

460
00:31:29,791 --> 00:31:31,541
She will get married
in an Indian attire, right?

461
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:36,041
I'll go to Patiala and get a few beautiful
Patiala dresses for her.

462
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:39,666
-Brother, aunt might end up insulted.
-Okay.

463
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,875
Now he is talking.

464
00:31:43,916 --> 00:31:46,666
Okay, she will wear Indian dresses.

465
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:50,916
But it will cost you another 25,000 daily.

466
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:53,833
Let's fix a lump sum.
It will last only for five to six days.

467
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,916
Fine, give a lump sum amount of 100,000.

468
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,375
I would like to praise you.

469
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:03,208
-I have never seen a leech like you.
-No problem.

470
00:32:03,291 --> 00:32:04,708
Then good luck dressing her up
in Indian attire.

471
00:32:04,791 --> 00:32:06,791
Fine, I will pay 100,000. Good.

472
00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:46,000
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

473
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:47,500
Congratulations to you too.

474
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:49,291
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

475
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:50,750
Congratulations, aunt.

476
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:55,083
Son, don't be too pleased.

477
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:56,916
She is taking money to get married.

478
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:58,958
Otherwise, you will get upset later.

479
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:01,333
Father, she is worth it.

480
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,750
It's not a problem if I have to bear
some more trouble because of her.

481
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,333
And as elders say,
you have to die to visit heaven.

482
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:33,583
Geet, now you are just like family.

483
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:34,708
Can I make a request?

484
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,916
Don't get too cozy.

485
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:39,958
It will cost you.

486
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,583
Don't worry about the money.

487
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:43,541
I'll manage it like this.

488
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:44,833
Lakkha, please come here.

489
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:47,250
Yes?

490
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:49,541
He says he wants to spend some money.

491
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:51,250
Money will be spent like this.

492
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:52,291
Look at this.

493
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:57,083
Honestly speaking,
I feel like puking when I see you.

494
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,916
Just like when you feel like puking
sitting on the last seat

495
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,375
in the bus while traveling to Shimla.

496
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:03,625
Fine, then you sit on the engine
of the bus to Shimla

497
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:07,583
and I will get our plane ready
and start packing.

498
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:10,541
How many bags do you have
that you need time to pack?

499
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:12,500
You have one small red bag.
It won't even take five minutes.

500
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:14,583
Fine, then I will be back in five minutes.

501
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:16,750
Lakkha, please listen to me.

502
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:20,458
God will bless you.

503
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,458
Tell her to be a little polite
towards the villagers.

504
00:34:23,791 --> 00:34:25,125
Otherwise, they will get suspicious.

505
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,041
Per day or lump sum?

506
00:34:29,416 --> 00:34:30,583
Lump sum?

507
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:32,791
One hundred thousand.

508
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:36,000
Fine. You can take it from the cash gifts.

509
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:38,125
Hand over the rest to me.

510
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:40,625
-Lakkha, you should start packing.
-Yes.

511
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:43,250
-Father!
-Yes!

512
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:47,916
-Give me 100,000 rupees.
-Why do you need it?

513
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:49,750
Meeting and greeting?

514
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:51,208
Your hand please.

515
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,583
Congratulations, German. Take it.

516
00:34:55,666 --> 00:34:57,875
This is for you.
And this is for your wife.

517
00:35:03,791 --> 00:35:05,791
Give it here. Take this.

518
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:09,666
This is not fair. This is not fair.

519
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,166
Why are you crying, headman?
You too go ahead.

520
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,500
Get lost! We don't get along with you.
Go away.

521
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:20,291
-What was this?
-Meeting and greeting?

522
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:21,375
Give me the money back.

523
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:23,166
-Why?
-Give me the money back.

524
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,083
Fifty thousand is enough.

525
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:32,500
If she keeps greetings so freely,
you will get loads of gifts.

526
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:35,708
Come on, let's take some photographs.
Come on, come here.

527
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:56,458
<i>She had brown eyes</i>
<i>And a wheatish complexion</i>

528
00:35:56,541 --> 00:35:58,916
<i>She had brown eyes</i>
<i>And a wheatish complexion</i>

529
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,125
<i>She looked like an angel to me</i>

530
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:05,250
<i>She just passed by me</i>
<i>And stole my heart away</i>

531
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:07,791
<i>She stole my heart away</i>

532
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:10,000
<i>She stole my heart away</i>

533
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:13,333
<i>She stole my heart away</i>

534
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:17,083
<i>She had brown eyes</i>
<i>And a wheatish complexion</i>

535
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:32,666
<i>Blooming like spring was her beauty</i>

536
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:37,791
<i>Her lips couldn't stop smiling</i>

537
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:43,125
<i>Blooming like spring was her beauty</i>

538
00:36:43,708 --> 00:36:46,500
<i>Her lips couldn't stop smiling</i>

539
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,708
<i>She shook my world</i>

540
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
<i>She shook my world</i>

541
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:55,000
<i>She is an enchanting witch!</i>

542
00:36:56,375 --> 00:37:00,583
<i>She just passed by me</i>
<i>And stole my heart away</i>

543
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:03,958
<i>She stole my heart away</i>

544
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,750
<i>She stole my heart away</i>

545
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,833
<i>She had brown eyes</i>
<i>And a wheatish complexion</i>

546
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,000
<i>She was wearing a bright red dress</i>

547
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:31,875
<i>She bumped into me at the village fair</i>

548
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:37,958
<i>She was wearing a bright red dress</i>

549
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:41,416
<i>She bumped into me at the village fair</i>

550
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,583
<i>The single strand of hair on her forehead</i>

551
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,291
<i>The single strand of hair</i>
<i>On her forehead targeted me</i>

552
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:49,375
<i>She just passed by me</i>

553
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:55,250
<i>And stole my heart away</i>

554
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:58,500
<i>She stole my heart away</i>

555
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:02,458
<i>She stole my heart away</i>

556
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:05,166
<i>She had brown eyes</i>
<i>And a wheatish complexion</i>

557
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,083
German.

558
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:23,000
Son.

559
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:25,375
Think about it once again.

560
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,916
This is the most precious thing I possess.

561
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:34,291
Father, the one I am giving it to
is the most precious thing of my life.

562
00:38:34,666 --> 00:38:38,208
This necklace has big stones.

563
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,500
Big stones to fulfill big desires.

564
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:45,416
Yes.

565
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:50,333
If it is so then go fulfill your desires.

566
00:38:50,416 --> 00:38:51,625
Go, my son.

567
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,291
Hello! Where are you off to?
Where are you going?

568
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,583
-I am going inside.
-I know that you are going inside.

569
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:02,416
Is there a tunnel to England from here?

570
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,000
Will I have to ask you to meet her
for even two minutes?

571
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:09,083
You can meet her in the morning.
Go away. You cannot meet her now.

572
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:11,958
Father, please come here.

573
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:15,083
Tell him where I am going and what for.

574
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:16,041
What happened?

575
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:18,416
Talk to him.

576
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:20,958
Yes?

577
00:39:21,416 --> 00:39:23,708
Hello. I seek your sickle's blessings.

578
00:39:23,916 --> 00:39:25,250
Fine.

579
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:30,416
But who are you to question him?

580
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:34,250
My son is going to be with his wife.

581
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:39,500
If you try to stop him,
then you can see this.

582
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:41,833
I'll chop your head off.

583
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,958
Monkeys like you are sold
in the fair for 15 each.

584
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:49,458
We have paid you 1.7 million.

585
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:52,125
Come on, get lost.

586
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:58,083
Go, there's the animal shed.

587
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,458
Come with me. You can hear
what we are going to talk about.

588
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:05,458
No, brother.

589
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:08,291
It is your family matter.
You go and talk to her.

590
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:09,833
And the love that your father expressed...

591
00:40:09,916 --> 00:40:12,125
Do you think I should tag along with you?

592
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,708
-No.
-Okay then.

593
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:24,000
What are you doing here?

594
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:25,375
Well, I...

595
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:27,583
I thought you were a decent man.

596
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:30,333
Don't do anything
that would make me scream.

597
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,250
Can I sit and talk to you?

598
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:36,833
Fine.

599
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:42,625
Well, my mother left me when I was small.

600
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:46,666
Give me your hand.

601
00:40:54,791 --> 00:40:56,375
This necklace belonged to my mother.

602
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,250
She wanted her daughter-in-law to wear it.

603
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,625
Have you lost your mind?

604
00:41:06,541 --> 00:41:08,750
I am not your mother's daughter-in-law.

605
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,625
But she thinks that you are.

606
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:13,250
I have spoken to her.

607
00:41:15,583 --> 00:41:19,333
The sooner you get out of this feeling,
the happier you will be.

608
00:41:21,208 --> 00:41:25,958
I think the more I stay in this feeling,
the happier I will be.

609
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:30,833
You are really crazy.

610
00:41:30,916 --> 00:41:32,291
What will you tell your father?

611
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:36,500
Don't worry. I will talk to him.

612
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:42,958
You don't need to say anything
when there is love.

613
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,416
They understand.

614
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,500
Careful.

615
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:14,750
Where are you going, brother?

616
00:42:15,416 --> 00:42:16,375
Delhi.

617
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:17,958
Our flight for London
is booked for tomorrow.

618
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:19,250
-Why?
-What do you mean why?

619
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:21,750
You got married. Come to England
with the marriage certificate.

620
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:27,708
That's fine but if you leave so soon,
then the villagers will get suspicious.

621
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:29,500
They will start talking.

622
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:32,750
Okay, so you want us to stay
for a few more days?

623
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:38,375
We can stay, but it will cost you.

624
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:40,208
No problem. I'll pay.

625
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:43,541
No, there is no need
to make a deal for that.

626
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:55,250
We have done so much work.
We deserve a vacation.

627
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:56,833
We didn't wash the utensils.

628
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:58,833
Wait.

629
00:42:59,666 --> 00:43:00,625
I will carry it.

630
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:02,458
Don't think too much into it.

631
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:12,500
Father, go and give two to Boota.

632
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:13,958
That's the deal we had made.

633
00:44:14,208 --> 00:44:15,083
Everything else is fine.

634
00:44:15,166 --> 00:44:17,250
Stop it. How much do you want
to talk to your father?

635
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:18,750
You just came from there yesterday.

636
00:44:31,958 --> 00:44:34,125
Lakkha, England is very beautiful.

637
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,291
You might be a cheap person,

638
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:39,875
but I cannot express
how beautiful England is.

639
00:44:39,958 --> 00:44:40,958
Give me a hug, brother.

640
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:43,000
Get lost! He wants a hug!

641
00:44:43,083 --> 00:44:45,041
Okay, now stop acting.

642
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:48,125
-And pay the 10,000 pounds you owe us.
-Yes.

643
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,375
Which 10,000 pounds?

644
00:44:50,833 --> 00:44:52,583
I don't have anything. Listen to me.

645
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:54,000
I just have 3700 rupees.

646
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:56,750
All tenners.
I removed them from the garlands.

647
00:44:58,125 --> 00:45:00,958
You had promised that you will pay us
the balance in England.

648
00:45:01,208 --> 00:45:03,500
-Lakkha, check his bag.
-Give it to me.

649
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:05,291
Where are you hiding the pounds?

650
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:09,250
We have brought you to England,
not Bangladesh.

651
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:11,666
Let me see how you won't pay us.

652
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:15,416
Sorry. Knickers.

653
00:45:18,166 --> 00:45:19,333
Another one.

654
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,041
More knickers!

655
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:23,541
Did you bring anything to wear over them?

656
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:25,375
Or have you brought only knickers?

657
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:28,166
I had told you to talk about the money!

658
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:30,333
-Where is our payment?
-Where is our payment?

659
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:32,125
I am not sitting
at the Ferris wheel counter

660
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:33,541
that I can give you cash immediately.

661
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:35,375
Ferris wheel counter?

662
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:36,958
He is talking about the London Eye.

663
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,750
Why don't you understand?

664
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:48,250
Don't worry, Geet. I am in England now.

665
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:50,000
I'll earn 10,000 pounds like this.

666
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:52,208
Stop it. Pounds, like this!

667
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,916
They named him Major German Singh Mann

668
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,375
like he is the only king of Jaipur.

669
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,583
You will have to pay.

670
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:14,958
Don't worry, Lakkha. We will handle it.

671
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:16,875
There is no "we" in it.
You will have to handle it alone.

672
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:18,625
Whose bag is this?

673
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:24,083
Come here with the bag.

674
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:30,458
Lakkha!

675
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:39,916
<i>I wish to eat food cooked by my father</i>

676
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:43,833
Which father used to feed you dosas
in the bathroom?

677
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:46,875
If you want to eat radish stuffed bread,
then come outside.

678
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:49,625
Lakkha?

679
00:46:49,708 --> 00:46:53,166
I wanted to ask,
how does one have a bath over here?

680
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:54,958
There's a shower. Use it.

681
00:46:56,416 --> 00:46:58,750
That I understood. I know how to bathe.

682
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:01,083
I wanted to ask, how do you wash it?

683
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:04,666
Here you don't wash, you wipe it off.

684
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:06,791
And don't think too much about washing.

685
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:08,333
Think about earning.

686
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:11,791
-Can I say something?
-Yes, say.

687
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,541
At first,
I thought you were dirty from the outside.

688
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:16,708
But now I know
that you dirty from the inside as well.

689
00:47:16,791 --> 00:47:17,958
Wait, you!

690
00:47:20,291 --> 00:47:22,541
Get this straight. Don't touch the flour.

691
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:23,708
I'll come and make the dough.

692
00:49:05,416 --> 00:49:07,083
You drive well, son.

693
00:49:07,166 --> 00:49:09,333
-You are a citizen?
-Of course I am.

694
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:11,625
But you look like
you have just come from India.

695
00:49:12,208 --> 00:49:13,833
I might be a villager
but I think like a city person.

696
00:49:13,916 --> 00:49:14,916
I found a citizen,

697
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:17,625
gave her 1.7 million.

698
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:20,583
She came to India to get married.
And I end up here within 15 days.

699
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,333
You can find such girls here?

700
00:49:22,916 --> 00:49:25,375
Like this! They queue up.

701
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:27,208
Let me tell you something.

702
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:31,250
They wear such short hot pants.

703
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:32,958
They drink these big bottles of liquors.

704
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:35,541
-Such big bottles?
-Yes, these big bottles.

705
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:37,666
You can increase or decrease
the length of their shorts

706
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:39,125
but the size of the liquor bottle
doesn't decrease.

707
00:49:39,708 --> 00:49:40,750
Strange.

708
00:49:40,875 --> 00:49:42,000
Anyway, God bless them.

709
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,958
Do one thing.
Take the test and get a license made.

710
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,750
You have gotten the job.

711
00:49:46,625 --> 00:49:47,666
Goodbye, uncle.

712
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:48,750
-Okay, then.
-Bye.

713
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:28,541
Lakkha! Lakkha, my brother!

714
00:50:30,791 --> 00:50:31,875
Lakkha!

715
00:50:32,666 --> 00:50:34,000
Your brother's first salary.

716
00:50:34,333 --> 00:50:36,958
Hard earned money, 47,520 rupees.

717
00:50:37,541 --> 00:50:39,833
What 47,520 rupees?

718
00:50:39,916 --> 00:50:41,041
It's just 500 pounds for us.

719
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:43,083
You still need to pay 9500 pounds to Geet.

720
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:56,416
-German!
-Yes?

721
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,166
I have loaded the goods.

722
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:00,208
It should be there before 6:30 a.m.

723
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:01,291
At 6:00 a.m.!

724
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
-Here's the paperwork.
-Okay.

725
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:05,833
-Goodbye.
-Okay.

726
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:29,333
<i>My truck races through on GT road</i>

727
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:32,166
<i>It will stop directly at Pathankot</i>

728
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:34,708
<i>My truck, my love</i>

729
00:51:35,041 --> 00:51:37,750
<i>I have Hema Malini's photo</i>
<i>Stuck to the mirror</i>

730
00:51:39,208 --> 00:51:41,583
<i>I look at her when I miss you</i>

731
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:44,583
Who is he? Looks like one of ours.

732
00:51:46,375 --> 00:51:47,666
Sir, one minute please.

733
00:51:51,166 --> 00:51:53,166
Can you drop me off in the next city?

734
00:51:53,541 --> 00:51:54,666
Come on, get in.

735
00:51:54,791 --> 00:51:56,000
Thank you, brother.

736
00:51:57,541 --> 00:51:58,666
How are you?

737
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,708
Thank you very much, brother.

738
00:52:01,791 --> 00:52:04,000
My name is Amrik. I am from Ludhiana.

739
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:05,083
Okay, okay, okay.

740
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:06,541
Amrik Singh.

741
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:09,750
Your name suggests
that someone in your family

742
00:52:09,833 --> 00:52:11,916
had a desire to go to America.

743
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,125
You are absolutely right.

744
00:52:13,208 --> 00:52:14,583
How do you know that?

745
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,875
My name is Major German Singh Mann.

746
00:52:21,166 --> 00:52:23,041
My father wanted to send me to Germany.

747
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,875
Look where we meet, in London.

748
00:52:28,958 --> 00:52:30,958
You are right.

749
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:33,916
Let's have some to celebrate the occasion.

750
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,458
Have you lost your mind?

751
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:38,208
Don't you know how many responsibilities
a driver has?

752
00:52:38,541 --> 00:52:40,791
You want me to get drunk?

753
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:42,583
Don't drink if you don't want to.

754
00:52:42,666 --> 00:52:43,791
Why are you getting angry?

755
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:45,708
Don't drink if you don't want to.

756
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:49,208
Who says I don't want to drink?
We will park and drink.

757
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:57,250
Play some song.

758
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:01,666
I don't know how it works.

759
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:03,708
It's not my truck. You can try.

760
00:53:04,041 --> 00:53:07,166
Okay, I'll play it. It plays from here.

761
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:11,916
<i>Your trailer has been detached.</i>

762
00:53:12,666 --> 00:53:15,125
What is it saying? Shut it.

763
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:16,625
Here you go.

764
00:53:17,166 --> 00:53:18,375
It's not working.

765
00:53:23,708 --> 00:53:27,000
I'm done. I have to leave by 4:00 a.m.

766
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:29,375
-Fine then, bottoms up.
-Bottoms up.

767
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,083
-Here you go, brother.
-Here.

768
00:53:37,166 --> 00:53:38,291
-I'm off to sleep.
-Okay, brother.

769
00:53:38,375 --> 00:53:40,625
-Okay, good night.
-Good night.

770
00:53:40,708 --> 00:53:41,625
Night.

771
00:53:45,916 --> 00:53:47,250
Come on brother, come inside.

772
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,541
How are you, buddy?

773
00:54:01,625 --> 00:54:02,625
Good. How about you?

774
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:04,083
What's the time?

775
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:05,750
Six o'clock.

776
00:54:05,833 --> 00:54:07,708
I was to report at 6:30 a.m.
I am half an hour early.

777
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:08,875
Take your goods off.

778
00:54:09,916 --> 00:54:11,583
-Which goods?
-Don't you get it?

779
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:12,875
Get your goods off.

780
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,041
Which goods are you talking about?

781
00:54:17,583 --> 00:54:18,708
Idiot.

782
00:54:20,708 --> 00:54:22,083
It's already gone.

783
00:54:33,208 --> 00:54:34,666
<i>Your trailer has been detached.</i>

784
00:54:39,541 --> 00:54:41,250
Brother, you could have come
half an hour late

785
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:43,416
but you should have at least
brought the goods with you.

786
00:54:44,625 --> 00:54:47,250
Come on, move this truck
and bring the other truck forward.

787
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:52,625
What will happen?

788
00:54:56,916 --> 00:54:58,125
Get lost from here!

789
00:54:58,208 --> 00:54:59,583
Don't show me your face again.

790
00:55:05,916 --> 00:55:07,291
Try to understand.

791
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:08,625
I don't have any work for you.

792
00:55:09,125 --> 00:55:11,791
Auntie, I will have to leave England.

793
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:13,583
Have mercy on me.

794
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:16,500
Fine, son.

795
00:55:17,041 --> 00:55:21,583
Tell me, what work will you do
in this boutique?

796
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:24,041
Oh, come on!
I was friends with Kaka, the tailor.

797
00:55:24,125 --> 00:55:27,500
I know how to cut, fold and iron clothes.

798
00:55:27,583 --> 00:55:28,708
Really?

799
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,666
I can place my hand
on your hot iron and...

800
00:55:31,791 --> 00:55:32,833
Swear upon it?

801
00:55:34,833 --> 00:55:36,625
You are funny.

802
00:55:37,041 --> 00:55:39,208
Fine, I'll give you a job.

803
00:55:41,416 --> 00:55:42,291
Okay,

804
00:55:42,875 --> 00:55:47,583
but you will get only 300 pounds per week.

805
00:55:49,708 --> 00:55:51,458
-How much per month?
-1200.

806
00:55:52,833 --> 00:55:55,250
-How much in Indian rupees?
-You do the math.

807
00:55:57,541 --> 00:55:59,083
I will not be able
to send it to India anyway.

808
00:56:00,166 --> 00:56:01,791
Nine times twelve.

809
00:56:04,416 --> 00:56:06,875
In this way,
it will take a year to pay Geet.

810
00:56:08,708 --> 00:56:10,500
-It's OK.
-OK, tell me something.

811
00:56:10,583 --> 00:56:13,416
Can you at least converse
in English a little?

812
00:56:13,708 --> 00:56:16,375
A little? I am great in English.
Go ahead and test me.

813
00:56:16,458 --> 00:56:17,458
Really?

814
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:22,125
Okay. If you want to say "come here."

815
00:56:22,791 --> 00:56:23,708
To whom?

816
00:56:24,333 --> 00:56:25,583
-Here?
-Yes.

817
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,416
Okay.

818
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:35,083
And if you have to say "go there?"

819
00:56:35,541 --> 00:56:36,708
Go there.

820
00:56:36,791 --> 00:56:39,833
-There? There?
-Anywhere.

821
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:42,375
You think this is a difficult question.

822
00:56:42,458 --> 00:56:43,708
I'll go there and say come here.

823
00:56:47,625 --> 00:56:49,583
Fine, start working.

824
00:57:29,041 --> 00:57:30,125
Hello.

825
00:57:31,125 --> 00:57:33,041
You? What are you doing here?

826
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:37,750
You didn't come to collect the installment
so I was worried.

827
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:39,958
I thought I should inquire
about your well-being

828
00:57:40,041 --> 00:57:41,291
and also give you the installment.

829
00:57:42,833 --> 00:57:44,541
Who gave you the address of this place?

830
00:57:44,625 --> 00:57:46,750
I took it from Lakkha's drawer.

831
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,750
Really? Didn't you feel ashamed?

832
00:57:49,166 --> 00:57:52,041
People here don't touch other people's
personal belongings.

833
00:57:53,291 --> 00:57:54,791
I wanted to discuss
something very important.

834
00:57:54,875 --> 00:57:56,333
What did you want to talk about?

835
00:57:56,416 --> 00:57:57,750
What are you trying to prove?

836
00:57:59,333 --> 00:58:02,000
That you are very handsome and
you have a very impressive personality?

837
00:58:03,666 --> 00:58:07,250
Geet, I...
I want to take you out for dinner.

838
00:58:07,708 --> 00:58:08,625
Why?

839
00:58:09,041 --> 00:58:10,750
Why should I go to dinner with you?

840
00:58:14,375 --> 00:58:15,958
I love you.

841
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,833
I told the sooner you get rid
of this feeling, the better it would be.

842
00:58:23,916 --> 00:58:25,375
But you didn't get me.

843
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:31,083
No, you don't want to understand.

844
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:32,291
Wait.

845
00:58:32,833 --> 00:58:33,708
Ricky!

846
00:58:50,041 --> 00:58:51,375
How are you, bro? All good?

847
00:58:55,875 --> 00:58:57,916
Ricky and I are getting married
next month.

848
00:59:02,416 --> 00:59:05,250
Lakkha will be attending it.
So you too can attend it.

849
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:08,708
Anyway, you have a good experience
of handling a wedding.

850
00:59:09,708 --> 00:59:10,583
Right?

851
00:59:52,416 --> 00:59:53,916
Have a look.

852
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:06,750
Look buddy, you and I are from Sangrur.

853
01:00:07,125 --> 01:00:09,500
We are brothers. You don't have to worry.

854
01:00:09,791 --> 01:00:11,750
You are unnecessarily working
for 50 pounds a day.

855
01:00:12,125 --> 01:00:14,583
Spend a little
and become a permanent resident.

856
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:16,000
It is expensive.

857
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:18,750
Twenty thousand pounds
is hardly a huge sum.

858
01:00:18,833 --> 01:00:21,583
Do one thing, pay half before the wedding
and half after the wedding.

859
01:00:21,666 --> 01:00:23,208
-Okay?
-Hey Brinda.

860
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:34,416
-It won't cause a commotion, right?
-Commotion?

861
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,875
I am not selling you the London Bridge
that I'd cause a commotion.

862
01:00:36,958 --> 01:00:38,375
You'll make me a citizen?

863
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:40,875
Brother, you can become a permanent
citizen only after you get married.

864
01:00:40,958 --> 01:00:42,625
You are not bread
that I can bake you in an oven.

865
01:00:51,708 --> 01:00:53,666
Hey bro, what's up?

866
01:00:54,041 --> 01:00:55,041
Hey Hey, How is this?

867
01:00:55,125 --> 01:00:56,416
How are you?

868
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,750
Serve me a drink, bro.

869
01:00:59,541 --> 01:01:00,583
It's stiff!

870
01:01:06,875 --> 01:01:08,250
I have explained everything to him.

871
01:01:08,333 --> 01:01:09,333
He agreed.

872
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:16,291
-Come on!
-Come here, then.

873
01:01:16,666 --> 01:01:18,458
-Stand next to her.
-Now you two are set.

874
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:35,833
For performing a fake marriage
with a Punjabi boy

875
01:02:35,916 --> 01:02:37,333
to help him get citizenship.

876
01:02:58,666 --> 01:03:02,833
But last night, you told me
how you perform fake marriages.

877
01:03:05,625 --> 01:03:07,083
You will have to answer me.

878
01:03:07,166 --> 01:03:11,250
You mean to say that you got married
but it wasn't fake?

879
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:21,458
Neither meet nor try to meet Geet.

880
01:03:30,083 --> 01:03:33,791
I know that you went to India
on May 7th with Lakhwinder Johal.

881
01:03:34,208 --> 01:03:36,791
We will find that Punjab boy
in a few days.

882
01:03:36,875 --> 01:03:39,041
So it would be better
if you tell us the truth.

883
01:03:44,416 --> 01:03:45,750
Yes, I got married.

884
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:49,458
But mine was a genuine marriage.

885
01:03:54,375 --> 01:03:55,708
Oh, so this is a genuine marriage?

886
01:03:58,958 --> 01:04:02,125
Call your husband
and ask him to come here right away.

887
01:04:12,041 --> 01:04:13,416
What happened? Can't get through?

888
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:16,041
I know you got married for money.

889
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:17,875
And you two don't stay together.

890
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,166
I told you!

891
01:04:23,791 --> 01:04:25,458
Mine wasn't a fake marriage.

892
01:04:25,541 --> 01:04:27,083
My marriage is genuine.

893
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:32,291
My husband has gone to Vegas
with his friends.

894
01:04:32,375 --> 01:04:33,500
Then why didn't you go with him?

895
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:38,416
I don't like Vegas and gambling.

896
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:39,666
When is he coming back?

897
01:04:44,916 --> 01:04:47,208
You will come here
with your husband in two weeks.

898
01:04:47,291 --> 01:04:48,750
We will interview both of you.

899
01:04:50,958 --> 01:04:53,791
If you are unable to prove
that your marriage is genuine,

900
01:04:54,125 --> 01:04:57,541
then you will get five years imprisonment
and a 100,000 pounds fine.

901
01:05:13,875 --> 01:05:18,250
Ricky! Ricky! Ricky!

902
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:21,416
Where are you going?

903
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,500
My cousin in Manchester
was in an accident,

904
01:05:23,583 --> 01:05:26,333
-Terry.
-But I need you.

905
01:05:26,958 --> 01:05:28,875
Geet, try to understand.
My cousin needs me too.

906
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:30,958
-He is all alone over there.
-What will I do, Ricky?

907
01:05:31,791 --> 01:05:33,708
Ricky! Ricky!

908
01:05:34,916 --> 01:05:37,166
Now you are more concerned
about your cousin!

909
01:05:37,958 --> 01:05:39,208
Why don't you understand?

910
01:05:39,291 --> 01:05:43,333
Immigration officers know that German
and I performed a fake marriage.

911
01:05:46,291 --> 01:05:47,500
Look, Geet.

912
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:51,375
I'll appoint the best lawyer
in the city for you.

913
01:05:51,458 --> 01:05:52,708
But I will have to leave right away.

914
01:05:55,083 --> 01:05:56,083
But Ricky,

915
01:05:58,125 --> 01:06:00,625
I did all this for both of us.

916
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:03,125
I know, darling. I know.

917
01:06:03,208 --> 01:06:04,708
I will be back in a few days.

918
01:06:04,791 --> 01:06:06,625
Please, try to understand.

919
01:06:59,333 --> 01:07:01,166
For two bucks.

920
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,083
Bro, have you seen this boy anywhere?

921
01:07:03,166 --> 01:07:05,708
-Yes, I have seen him.
-Really? Where?

922
01:07:05,791 --> 01:07:08,416
-He used to work for us.
-Okay.

923
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,125
He didn't show up.

924
01:07:10,208 --> 01:07:12,375
He worked for 15 days
and then he didn't show up.

925
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:14,250
Where did he go?
Any forwarding address or anything?

926
01:07:14,333 --> 01:07:16,666
No, I don't know where he went.

927
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:48,833
No woman can be so tall.

928
01:07:50,125 --> 01:07:52,000
I think our guy made a mistake.

929
01:07:53,625 --> 01:07:55,083
I will have to do something about it.

930
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:09,291
Forget it, it's not important.

931
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:18,291
<i>Within two weeks,</i>
<i>you will come with your husband.</i>

932
01:08:18,375 --> 01:08:19,708
<i>One interview will happen</i>

933
01:08:21,958 --> 01:08:25,083
<i>If you can't prove</i>
<i>that your marriage is genuine,</i>

934
01:08:25,166 --> 01:08:29,166
then it's five years imprisonement
and a 100,000 pound fine.

935
01:08:55,958 --> 01:08:57,291
Hey! German!

936
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,791
She is Mayor Adam Bell's daughter.

937
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:03,458
The white gown I had asked you to iron,

938
01:09:03,541 --> 01:09:04,500
is it ready?

939
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:06,166
-It is ready.
-Get it.

940
01:09:57,958 --> 01:10:00,750
What the hell, Major! What happened!

941
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:03,750
The gown was fine till yesterday.
What did you do?

942
01:10:04,375 --> 01:10:06,375
It was very big, aunt.

943
01:10:06,458 --> 01:10:09,291
It would have trailed behind her
like a carriage behind horses.

944
01:10:09,833 --> 01:10:11,416
It is a wedding dress.

945
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,333
If she would have tripped on it
and broke her bones,

946
01:10:13,416 --> 01:10:14,791
then who would have been held responsible?

947
01:10:14,875 --> 01:10:15,833
Major.

948
01:10:16,375 --> 01:10:18,833
So I cut it short.
Now she can dance all she wants in it.

949
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:21,125
It's okay, aunt.

950
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:23,500
Excuse me. Stay here.

951
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:29,916
She is getting married.
Soon she will have children of her own.

952
01:10:30,166 --> 01:10:31,625
I made this dress for her daughter.

953
01:10:37,416 --> 01:10:38,916
Get up, aunt! It's okay.

954
01:10:39,458 --> 01:10:41,083
Get up, aunt! Don't worry. Get up, aunt!

955
01:11:20,291 --> 01:11:24,416
How are you? Is everything fine?

956
01:11:25,333 --> 01:11:28,833
I am okay here, just travelling.

957
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:33,875
Going to the office for work.

958
01:11:39,041 --> 01:11:40,375
Why are you following me?

959
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:42,291
When did I follow you?

960
01:11:43,541 --> 01:11:45,416
You have a habit of lying.

961
01:11:46,166 --> 01:11:48,833
Look, you paid me.
You got the citizenship.

962
01:11:48,916 --> 01:11:50,291
Now go and mind your own business.

963
01:11:51,083 --> 01:11:52,833
I take this bus to work every day.

964
01:11:52,916 --> 01:11:53,833
I go there every day at this hour.

965
01:11:53,916 --> 01:11:55,083
I am not following you. Listen to me.

966
01:11:57,208 --> 01:11:58,875
This is England.

967
01:11:59,375 --> 01:12:03,208
Here you need money
to fulfill your dreams.

968
01:12:03,291 --> 01:12:06,000
I wanted to settle in Liverpool
after getting married to you.

969
01:12:07,125 --> 01:12:08,625
That's why I did all this.

970
01:12:08,708 --> 01:12:10,708
But I didn't ask you
for any clarifications.

971
01:12:10,791 --> 01:12:12,250
I don't complain either.

972
01:12:12,333 --> 01:12:13,875
Why are you troubling me?

973
01:12:15,458 --> 01:12:17,500
No, I... just...

974
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:21,708
If there are any grudges,
then we can talk.

975
01:12:22,083 --> 01:12:26,291
You have grudges and complain
if you have an ego or arrogance.

976
01:12:26,708 --> 01:12:27,916
And there is no place
for these things in love.

977
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:32,208
But if you still think I am coming
in your way then forgive me.

978
01:12:32,291 --> 01:12:33,416
I won't do it again.

979
01:12:35,416 --> 01:12:36,416
German.

980
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,791
I have searched the whole city
looking for you.

981
01:12:53,875 --> 01:12:55,791
-Come with me.
-Where?

982
01:12:56,083 --> 01:12:57,500
The immigration department
has gotten suspicious about us.

983
01:12:57,583 --> 01:12:58,708
We need to give an interview.

984
01:13:00,916 --> 01:13:03,166
I have to report to work at 11:00 a.m.
I am not free.

985
01:13:07,708 --> 01:13:10,833
What are you doing?
Why aren't you listening me?

986
01:13:11,541 --> 01:13:13,916
Have you lost your mind?

987
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,208
You are worried about your work?

988
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:17,000
If the immigration department
finds any proof,

989
01:13:21,208 --> 01:13:22,916
You don't even understand English!

990
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:26,916
They will send you back to India.

991
01:13:29,583 --> 01:13:32,375
I don't need your help.
I'll handle it on my own.

992
01:13:39,875 --> 01:13:41,041
Have you gone crazy?

993
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,458
You are in deep shit.

994
01:13:44,916 --> 01:13:45,833
I am not.

995
01:13:45,916 --> 01:13:47,500
It's not like they are about to declare
my high school results

996
01:13:47,583 --> 01:13:49,166
that I would be in deep shit.
Understood?

997
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:52,333
You are in deep shit because
the immigration department caught you.

998
01:13:52,416 --> 01:13:53,666
Now you will be put behind bars.

999
01:13:54,791 --> 01:13:57,250
I will handle my situation in my way.
Understood?

1000
01:14:00,833 --> 01:14:01,708
Listen.

1001
01:14:03,791 --> 01:14:06,500
I think we both need each other.

1002
01:14:10,625 --> 01:14:11,708
And other times, it's "get lost."

1003
01:14:12,166 --> 01:14:15,416
You are just as unpredictable
as the weather.

1004
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:23,750
Okay, I could think about it
if you apologize.

1005
01:14:30,125 --> 01:14:31,666
This was just a facade.

1006
01:14:31,958 --> 01:14:33,125
I want it to be said
with feelings from within.

1007
01:14:42,208 --> 01:14:44,291
I know a little English.

1008
01:14:44,375 --> 01:14:49,833
But I want you to apologize
for everything, in Punjabi.

1009
01:14:49,916 --> 01:14:51,041
That too in one breath.

1010
01:14:53,375 --> 01:14:55,833
I have troubled you a lot.

1011
01:14:55,916 --> 01:14:57,583
I apologize for that.

1012
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,208
Oh God!

1013
01:15:03,083 --> 01:15:06,041
No day has ever been
as beautiful as today.

1014
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:15,333
Come on, let's go
and prepare for the interview.

1015
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:17,291
Let's go.

1016
01:15:23,875 --> 01:15:26,458
<i>Groceries and bills</i>
<i>have been taken care of</i>

1017
01:15:26,541 --> 01:15:28,750
<i>All we need to take care of is the rent</i>

1018
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:30,375
<i>It's close, dear</i>

1019
01:15:30,458 --> 01:15:32,666
<i>It's your beloved drink</i>

1020
01:15:33,916 --> 01:15:35,166
Tell me, what do I need to do?

1021
01:15:38,208 --> 01:15:40,083
Our interview will take place
next next Monday.

1022
01:15:40,166 --> 01:15:43,208
We will stay together in my apartment
for the next two weeks

1023
01:15:43,291 --> 01:15:45,833
so that we can get
to know each other better.

1024
01:15:47,875 --> 01:15:50,875
The same apartment which has a sea view?

1025
01:15:51,333 --> 01:15:54,375
It's not a sea, it's a river.
Thames river.

1026
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:56,250
We will stay together?

1027
01:15:56,333 --> 01:15:58,041
Yes, we will stay together.

1028
01:15:58,125 --> 01:15:59,833
I'll also show you the London Bridge.

1029
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:04,250
I'll take you to...

1030
01:16:29,166 --> 01:16:31,833
<i>A beautiful tall maiden</i>

1031
01:16:32,333 --> 01:16:34,875
<i>Her eyes are like a deep ocean</i>

1032
01:16:35,166 --> 01:16:37,708
<i>She is a beauty</i>

1033
01:16:38,166 --> 01:16:40,666
<i>God has taken His own</i>
<i>Sweet time to make her</i>

1034
01:16:41,125 --> 01:16:44,208
<i>Even the sun is awestruck</i>

1035
01:16:47,291 --> 01:16:49,625
<i>Even the sun is awestruck</i>

1036
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,875
<i>When it is blessed with your presence</i>

1037
01:16:52,958 --> 01:16:55,958
<i>Water feels blessed</i>

1038
01:16:56,041 --> 01:16:58,625
<i>When you take it to your lips</i>

1039
01:16:58,916 --> 01:17:01,916
<i>Water feels blessed</i>

1040
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,375
<i>When you take it to your lips</i>

1041
01:17:16,791 --> 01:17:18,708
<i>There is no one like you</i>

1042
01:17:19,416 --> 01:17:22,500
<i>Even the angels are jealous of you</i>

1043
01:17:22,583 --> 01:17:24,875
<i>Even the best damsels</i>

1044
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:27,916
<i>Cannot be compared to you</i>

1045
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,875
<i>Even the best damsels</i>

1046
01:17:30,958 --> 01:17:34,291
<i>Cannot be compared to you</i>

1047
01:17:34,375 --> 01:17:37,458
<i>Your cheeks are milky</i>

1048
01:17:38,708 --> 01:17:41,583
<i>You apply cream on them daily</i>

1049
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,750
<i>Water feels blessed</i>

1050
01:17:44,833 --> 01:17:47,791
<i>When you take it to your lips</i>

1051
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:50,750
<i>Water feels blessed</i>

1052
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:54,083
<i>When you take it to your lips</i>

1053
01:18:05,583 --> 01:18:11,166
<i>When you smile,</i>
<i>Millions of flowers blossom</i>

1054
01:18:11,541 --> 01:18:17,000
<i>Hey my fair lady,</i>
<i>You don't need to apply any make up</i>

1055
01:18:17,375 --> 01:18:21,000
<i>Even the snake wants to be kohl</i>

1056
01:18:21,833 --> 01:18:24,625
<i>Even the snake wants to be kohl</i>

1057
01:18:24,708 --> 01:18:27,750
<i>When you wish to apply some on your eyes</i>

1058
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:30,791
<i>Water feels blessed</i>

1059
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:33,666
<i>When you take it to your lips</i>

1060
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:36,375
<i>Water feels blessed</i>

1061
01:18:36,458 --> 01:18:39,666
<i>When you take it to your lips</i>

1062
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:29,458
We have to take my parents along.

1063
01:19:48,208 --> 01:19:49,500
You got married?

1064
01:19:49,583 --> 01:19:51,958
But didn't you go to Scotland
to attend your friend's wedding?

1065
01:19:52,041 --> 01:19:53,833
How did you end up getting married?

1066
01:19:53,916 --> 01:19:56,125
I had gone to Scotland, mom.

1067
01:19:57,458 --> 01:19:59,083
That's where I had met him.

1068
01:19:59,875 --> 01:20:01,916
We fell in love.

1069
01:20:02,666 --> 01:20:03,708
So, we got married.

1070
01:20:04,041 --> 01:20:05,250
Who have you got here!

1071
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:06,875
If you had to get married
without informing us,

1072
01:20:06,958 --> 01:20:08,541
then you should have found someone better.

1073
01:20:09,041 --> 01:20:10,750
Ricky was much better than him.

1074
01:20:11,291 --> 01:20:13,250
Don't have any doubts.

1075
01:20:14,625 --> 01:20:15,833
I am English at heart.

1076
01:20:15,916 --> 01:20:18,375
England is as much mine as it is yours.

1077
01:20:19,333 --> 01:20:22,625
You didn't think it was important
to even call and inform your mother?

1078
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:25,916
Mummy, everything happened in such a hurry

1079
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,375
that I didn't get any chance to think.

1080
01:20:28,875 --> 01:20:32,166
Whenever you shop in a hurry,
you buy the wrong things.

1081
01:20:32,833 --> 01:20:34,375
Mummy, where's papa?

1082
01:20:37,083 --> 01:20:39,083
I called him at the truck station.

1083
01:20:39,166 --> 01:20:41,916
He is coming. He is on his way.
He'll be here soon.

1084
01:20:44,291 --> 01:20:45,583
Papa!

1085
01:20:45,666 --> 01:20:49,166
Shit! Damn. I mean, oh my goodness!

1086
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:50,875
It's boss!

1087
01:20:54,833 --> 01:20:55,791
Papa!

1088
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:57,583
Papa!

1089
01:20:58,958 --> 01:21:02,041
Geet, you know how upset I was with you?

1090
01:21:02,125 --> 01:21:03,000
Yes, papa.

1091
01:21:03,083 --> 01:21:07,208
But I am pleased that
you got married to a Sardar.

1092
01:21:07,458 --> 01:21:08,791
-Really, papa?
-Okay, I forgive you.

1093
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:13,750
Papa, he is your son-in-law,
Major German Singh Mann.

1094
01:21:13,833 --> 01:21:15,041
But why is he looking the other way?

1095
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:16,291
German, papa?

1096
01:21:16,791 --> 01:21:19,625
Why are you feeling shy like a new bride?

1097
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:23,000
Show me your face.
Okay, I forgive both of you.

1098
01:21:24,333 --> 01:21:25,708
Do you really forgive us?

1099
01:21:25,791 --> 01:21:26,791
Yes.

1100
01:21:32,291 --> 01:21:34,875
Oh. German, you?

1101
01:21:35,666 --> 01:21:38,250
So, you got married to my daughter
and became a citizen?

1102
01:21:38,333 --> 01:21:41,208
-Yes.
-So you gave her 1.7 million rupees

1103
01:21:41,291 --> 01:21:44,125
and she went to Punjab
to get married to you.

1104
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:49,875
Satwant, you know this boy
gave her 1.7 million rupees

1105
01:21:49,958 --> 01:21:52,333
and she went to Punjab
to get married to him.

1106
01:21:52,416 --> 01:21:53,541
Don't you have any shame?

1107
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:55,541
You have cheated us.

1108
01:21:56,041 --> 01:21:57,291
Sorry, papa.

1109
01:21:57,375 --> 01:21:59,541
-I needed the money.
-You needed money?

1110
01:21:59,625 --> 01:22:03,583
I have always given double
the pocket money you asked for.

1111
01:22:03,958 --> 01:22:05,500
Tell me, did I ever stop you
from doing anything?

1112
01:22:06,375 --> 01:22:08,041
And who did you get married to?

1113
01:22:08,125 --> 01:22:11,708
I have never seen anyone more duffer
and overconfident than him.

1114
01:22:11,791 --> 01:22:16,041
A container worth 20,000 pounds,
filled with fresh fruits,

1115
01:22:16,125 --> 01:22:18,833
he parked it on the road
and went to sleep. He was that sleepy.

1116
01:22:18,916 --> 01:22:20,291
Get lost from here!

1117
01:22:20,375 --> 01:22:21,833
Don't show me your face!

1118
01:22:22,375 --> 01:22:25,458
-Papa... I...
-What papa?

1119
01:22:26,083 --> 01:22:27,208
Get lost from here.

1120
01:22:27,291 --> 01:22:30,791
I feel ashamed
that my daughter got married for money.

1121
01:22:30,875 --> 01:22:32,208
And a fake marriage at that!

1122
01:22:33,708 --> 01:22:36,875
Look, you can throw me
out of your house if you want.

1123
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:39,208
But please let your daughter stay here.

1124
01:22:40,291 --> 01:22:42,583
Where will this poor soul go
in this condition?

1125
01:22:44,583 --> 01:22:46,125
What is wrong with Geet?

1126
01:22:47,291 --> 01:22:48,875
You are going to be a grandma.

1127
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:50,666
What?

1128
01:22:57,958 --> 01:23:01,083
Look, no matter what you say,

1129
01:23:02,166 --> 01:23:03,708
my daughter won't leave this house.

1130
01:23:06,375 --> 01:23:07,791
Okay then, goodbye.

1131
01:23:08,333 --> 01:23:10,458
Please forgive me, if possible.

1132
01:23:14,083 --> 01:23:15,166
Papa.

1133
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:18,666
-Papa.
-German!

1134
01:23:20,291 --> 01:23:22,416
-Yes, daddy?
-If I see you even anywhere

1135
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:25,416
close to my house, I'll shoot you. Out!

1136
01:23:27,416 --> 01:23:28,833
I am going, daddy.

1137
01:23:29,833 --> 01:23:31,041
German, my son!

1138
01:23:31,583 --> 01:23:32,666
Stay.

1139
01:23:33,208 --> 01:23:35,500
Listen, our daughter is pregnant.

1140
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:39,958
What will we tell everyone?
Think about that as well.

1141
01:23:41,166 --> 01:23:42,708
Go to hell, I don't give a damn.

1142
01:23:48,625 --> 01:23:49,875
Take it inside, kid.

1143
01:23:56,708 --> 01:24:00,916
Mummy, what you said about son-in-laws
is very good.

1144
01:24:04,625 --> 01:24:06,750
Please make some rice and curry.
I am hungry.

1145
01:24:09,083 --> 01:24:10,291
Okay, I'll make it.

1146
01:24:41,041 --> 01:24:44,375
Geet is sleeping on the floor
and German is sleeping on the bed.

1147
01:24:44,458 --> 01:24:45,583
What are you saying?

1148
01:24:46,625 --> 01:24:47,750
Go and see it for yourself.

1149
01:24:48,291 --> 01:24:50,041
What? Let's go.

1150
01:25:00,416 --> 01:25:02,833
Mummy? Good morning, mummy. Come in.

1151
01:25:03,375 --> 01:25:04,666
Good morning, son.

1152
01:25:05,791 --> 01:25:09,916
-She is still sleeping?
-No, mummy. She is very fortunate.

1153
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,416
She sleeps soundly.

1154
01:25:15,291 --> 01:25:16,958
What happened? Is everything alright?

1155
01:25:17,041 --> 01:25:18,000
It's nothing, son.

1156
01:25:18,083 --> 01:25:21,416
I just came to tell you to get ready
as I am preparing your breakfast.

1157
01:25:22,291 --> 01:25:23,333
Okay.

1158
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:32,208
You should stay within your limits.
Don't try to get personal.

1159
01:25:32,291 --> 01:25:33,583
How many times have I told you that!

1160
01:25:36,375 --> 01:25:38,291
Don't make me angry.

1161
01:25:38,708 --> 01:25:40,583
If your mother had seen you sleeping
on the sofa,

1162
01:25:40,666 --> 01:25:41,875
then you would have
been wearing prison clothes.

1163
01:25:44,708 --> 01:25:45,625
Go and have a bath.

1164
01:25:54,541 --> 01:25:55,666
Daddy.

1165
01:25:58,583 --> 01:26:00,375
I know you are upset with me.

1166
01:26:00,833 --> 01:26:02,333
But let me tell you the truth.

1167
01:26:02,416 --> 01:26:03,916
German is a very nice guy.

1168
01:26:04,291 --> 01:26:07,333
<i>Tara writes from London!</i>

1169
01:26:08,166 --> 01:26:11,125
<i>Tell me what's happening</i>
<i>in the village, my friend!</i>

1170
01:26:13,083 --> 01:26:14,166
What is this?

1171
01:26:15,041 --> 01:26:16,750
In England?

1172
01:26:16,833 --> 01:26:19,875
No, it's not that.

1173
01:26:20,583 --> 01:26:21,916
It is a toy.

1174
01:26:22,583 --> 01:26:25,083
You won't find anyone smarter than him.

1175
01:26:26,833 --> 01:26:28,375
Give him a chance.

1176
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,375
From where did you get this wild man?

1177
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:45,416
Does he even know how to live at home?
Crazy man!

1178
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:47,833
Throw him out of our house!

1179
01:26:47,916 --> 01:26:50,541
What happened? What happened here?

1180
01:26:50,625 --> 01:26:51,958
How did this happen?

1181
01:26:53,916 --> 01:26:55,666
He dares to call me daddy!

1182
01:26:56,375 --> 01:26:58,708
Mother, you should at least
keep some wipes handy at home.

1183
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,375
-What happened to her suddenly?
-What happened?

1184
01:27:08,458 --> 01:27:10,250
-What happened?
-What happened?

1185
01:27:10,333 --> 01:27:11,291
-It happened last night as well.
-Tell me what's wrong!

1186
01:27:11,375 --> 01:27:12,583
It happened last night as well. Get up.

1187
01:27:12,666 --> 01:27:13,875
-It's okay. Let's go inside.
-Mummy.

1188
01:27:13,958 --> 01:27:16,666
-Mummy!
-Hey. at least tell me what's wrong.

1189
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:18,583
-It's okay. It's okay.
-Let's go inside.

1190
01:27:24,333 --> 01:27:25,791
-It's okay!
-What happened?

1191
01:27:34,083 --> 01:27:36,208
I thought that you could only talk.

1192
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:38,000
But you can think on your feet as well.

1193
01:27:38,708 --> 01:27:42,208
From now on, you won't cause
any trouble in front of papa.

1194
01:27:42,291 --> 01:27:43,458
Do you understand?

1195
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:45,875
Here's a pen and a notebook.

1196
01:27:45,958 --> 01:27:48,208
-And start preparing.
-Preparing for what?

1197
01:27:48,666 --> 01:27:49,833
For the interview.

1198
01:27:57,125 --> 01:28:00,083
This wasn't the deal.
It will cost you 500 pounds.

1199
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:04,041
Fine. Now leave.

1200
01:28:05,541 --> 01:28:08,416
What "fine?"
First pay then the job will be done.

1201
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:10,958
My account balance is zero at the moment.

1202
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:12,375
And I won't ask papa for money.

1203
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
I'll remove some from his cupboard
in the evening and pay you.

1204
01:28:15,083 --> 01:28:16,125
Now leave.

1205
01:28:17,291 --> 01:28:19,958
To take stolen money is like stealing.

1206
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:26,250
German!

1207
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,375
-Give me your slippers.
-What is it?

1208
01:28:29,833 --> 01:28:30,750
There!

1209
01:28:31,375 --> 01:28:33,250
What? What did I do?

1210
01:28:34,541 --> 01:28:38,041
Okay, your size is eight and a half
and mine is seven and a half.

1211
01:28:39,083 --> 01:28:40,458
My size is eight and one quarter.

1212
01:28:41,333 --> 01:28:42,708
Stop your nonsense.

1213
01:28:43,750 --> 01:28:46,333
-I use size eight. I am telling you.
-I told you to shut up.

1214
01:28:46,416 --> 01:28:49,125
Now tell me,
on which side of the bed do you sleep?

1215
01:28:49,208 --> 01:28:50,208
I sleep on the right.

1216
01:28:50,541 --> 01:28:51,583
I don't sleep on the bed.

1217
01:28:51,666 --> 01:28:53,083
I sleep on a cot,
with the head on the other side.

1218
01:28:53,458 --> 01:28:56,125
And my cot is right under the fan.

1219
01:28:56,458 --> 01:28:59,250
I fear heights the most. You?

1220
01:28:59,541 --> 01:29:01,125
I didn't even prepare so much
for my high school exams.

1221
01:29:01,208 --> 01:29:02,708
If I had, I would have stood first.

1222
01:29:04,208 --> 01:29:08,000
I fear...

1223
01:29:08,291 --> 01:29:11,583
Do you know how to give the right answer
to any of the questions?

1224
01:29:11,666 --> 01:29:13,250
You keep lying.

1225
01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:19,250
Mitha?

1226
01:29:20,333 --> 01:29:21,333
What is wrong with him?

1227
01:29:22,916 --> 01:29:26,500
I think he got bullied again.

1228
01:29:27,125 --> 01:29:29,375
There is an issue of racism over here.

1229
01:29:29,958 --> 01:29:33,125
Mitha is very innocent.

1230
01:29:33,666 --> 01:29:35,250
He gets scared quite easily.

1231
01:29:36,333 --> 01:29:37,208
Innocent?

1232
01:29:37,958 --> 01:29:39,375
He comes after me like a bully.

1233
01:29:46,083 --> 01:29:48,208
Hurry up, son. Your beans are ready.

1234
01:29:48,291 --> 01:29:51,208
Mom, I don't want to eat beans today.
You make beans every day.

1235
01:29:51,291 --> 01:29:52,458
What else do you want to eat? Tell me.

1236
01:29:54,583 --> 01:29:57,000
Idiot. Mummy, give him some buttermilk.

1237
01:29:57,083 --> 01:29:58,208
It will refresh him.

1238
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,041
It will scare the Englishmen away.

1239
01:30:01,125 --> 01:30:03,291
And fried food isn't healthy.

1240
01:30:03,708 --> 01:30:07,458
Give me some stuffed bread. I will eat it.

1241
01:30:09,041 --> 01:30:10,541
Okay, son. I'll make some right away.

1242
01:30:11,666 --> 01:30:13,291
Mom, I'm going to the gym.

1243
01:30:16,041 --> 01:30:18,666
Dear, you just had
a contraction yesterday.

1244
01:30:19,875 --> 01:30:21,083
You should stop going to the gym.

1245
01:30:22,416 --> 01:30:23,666
-Nothing had happened to me, mom.
-What?

1246
01:30:24,958 --> 01:30:28,416
Nothing happened because I was with her.
I was with her.

1247
01:30:28,583 --> 01:30:31,166
-Anything could have happened, mother.
-Yes, son.

1248
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:33,041
This problem can take place anytime.

1249
01:30:33,125 --> 01:30:35,791
Do one thing,
take German with you to the gym.

1250
01:30:38,083 --> 01:30:40,375
I said, take him with you.

1251
01:30:40,458 --> 01:30:43,458
-It will cost you 1000 pounds.
-Get lost!

1252
01:30:43,541 --> 01:30:45,208
Come if you want or don't.

1253
01:30:45,916 --> 01:30:47,416
What happened, son? What is she saying?

1254
01:30:47,791 --> 01:30:49,666
Nothing, mother. She asked me to hurry up.

1255
01:30:50,083 --> 01:30:51,875
Roll the bread and give it to me.

1256
01:30:52,875 --> 01:30:53,958
Okay.

1257
01:30:57,333 --> 01:30:59,125
She has found a nice husband.

1258
01:30:59,541 --> 01:31:00,625
He is so innocent.

1259
01:31:09,791 --> 01:31:10,666
Stop it already.

1260
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:12,041
You'll erode your bones
with so much running.

1261
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:16,083
Plastic dolls like you pose like this
at clothing stores.

1262
01:31:16,791 --> 01:31:17,666
Come on.

1263
01:31:31,166 --> 01:31:32,541
Do you want to increase your weight
or decrease it?

1264
01:31:32,625 --> 01:31:36,875
If you want to increase,
then have bananas and cream.

1265
01:31:36,958 --> 01:31:40,416
If you want to decrease,
then have lemonade with honey.

1266
01:31:40,666 --> 01:31:41,625
In lukewarm water.

1267
01:31:42,375 --> 01:31:45,250
Let me exercise.
Go and mind your own business.

1268
01:32:09,291 --> 01:32:11,833
Here's your 1000 pounds. Take it.

1269
01:32:12,208 --> 01:32:14,083
Mummy has done some shopping
for you as well.

1270
01:32:14,458 --> 01:32:15,458
Here's the bag.

1271
01:32:18,708 --> 01:32:21,916
I think she spent a lot of money on me.

1272
01:32:22,666 --> 01:32:24,666
Well, it's all about how much
you love your dear ones.

1273
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,916
Earlier you looked only like a thug.

1274
01:32:41,666 --> 01:32:43,833
Now I think you are a murderer as well.

1275
01:32:46,458 --> 01:32:47,625
Give them back.

1276
01:32:47,916 --> 01:32:48,875
I will, give me a minute.

1277
01:32:51,541 --> 01:32:52,541
-German.
-What's happening here?

1278
01:32:53,166 --> 01:32:55,125
Nothing's happening.
Go and mind your own business.

1279
01:32:59,458 --> 01:33:00,416
Tell me.

1280
01:33:06,333 --> 01:33:07,250
Tell me.

1281
01:33:07,875 --> 01:33:09,666
Elders say that sorrow
decreases when shared.

1282
01:33:16,875 --> 01:33:20,250
Last year, when Ricky
and I were coming out of a club,

1283
01:33:20,333 --> 01:33:22,250
we were cornered by a few foreigners.

1284
01:33:29,791 --> 01:33:30,833
Come on, give me.

1285
01:33:30,916 --> 01:33:31,916
We don't want any trouble!

1286
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,416
I'll give you what you want.

1287
01:34:02,083 --> 01:34:04,708
Next morning,
someone sent us these photographs.

1288
01:34:05,083 --> 01:34:07,166
And started blackmailing us.

1289
01:34:08,208 --> 01:34:12,041
Ricky gave all his savings
to the blackmailer.

1290
01:34:12,875 --> 01:34:14,958
I sold my car.

1291
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:18,375
And I started stealing money
from papa's cupboard.

1292
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:24,750
We have so far given 17,000 pounds
to the blackmailer.

1293
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,750
German, where are you going?

1294
01:34:34,916 --> 01:34:36,083
German!

1295
01:34:54,125 --> 01:34:56,416
There's the dead body
of the man you stabbed.

1296
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:02,625
Brother, my name is Amrik.
I am from Ludhiana.

1297
01:35:10,791 --> 01:35:12,750
Don't push him!

1298
01:35:14,416 --> 01:35:16,000
Don't hit him with this!

1299
01:35:20,291 --> 01:35:22,000
Don't hit his head with a brick!

1300
01:35:22,416 --> 01:35:24,500
-Wait, wait!
-Don't kill him.

1301
01:35:24,583 --> 01:35:26,000
Damn. You have lost your mind!

1302
01:35:26,583 --> 01:35:28,375
Don't get me arrested!

1303
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,291
Thank you very much for saving me,
brother, or else she would have killed me.

1304
01:35:44,208 --> 01:35:48,166
Brother, Anthony and Ricky
had given me 500 pounds

1305
01:35:48,791 --> 01:35:51,500
to do this drama.

1306
01:35:52,125 --> 01:35:55,750
There was someone hiding
and taking pictures of all this.

1307
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:58,666
And both the blood
and the dagger were fake.

1308
01:36:10,625 --> 01:36:14,250
I know, once our own is in trouble,
then how do we feel bad?

1309
01:36:16,375 --> 01:36:18,833
Yes, I know Ricky cheated me.

1310
01:36:18,916 --> 01:36:21,500
This doesn't mean that
now you stand a chance.

1311
01:36:21,916 --> 01:36:22,916
You have four days.

1312
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,375
Appear for the interview
and get out of my life.

1313
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:40,791
German, who else do you have
in your family?

1314
01:36:42,666 --> 01:36:45,458
Everyone, except a mother.

1315
01:36:47,583 --> 01:36:48,583
And I found one here.

1316
01:37:17,958 --> 01:37:18,958
Why are you feeling scared, Mitha?

1317
01:37:19,041 --> 01:37:20,958
They are just lanky boys.
Hit them and move forward.

1318
01:37:33,166 --> 01:37:34,708
I cannot hit anyone.

1319
01:37:36,291 --> 01:37:38,833
If you cannot hit them, you can
at least be brave enough to face them?

1320
01:37:39,583 --> 01:37:41,916
Now if they hit you, don't feel scared.

1321
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,291
You will see that
they will get scared and run away.

1322
01:37:43,833 --> 01:37:44,750
No.

1323
01:37:47,125 --> 01:37:49,125
German, he cannot do it.

1324
01:37:49,416 --> 01:37:50,791
He has to gather the courage, mother.

1325
01:37:51,125 --> 01:37:52,416
Today, they are telling him
to leave the ground.

1326
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,041
Next, they will tell him
to leave his house.

1327
01:37:54,125 --> 01:37:55,583
And then they will tell him
to leave this country.

1328
01:37:55,791 --> 01:37:57,208
Come on, my boy, go and face them.

1329
01:37:58,833 --> 01:38:00,333
You will have to get rid of your fear.

1330
01:38:00,416 --> 01:38:02,041
Otherwise,
it will keep killing you slowly.

1331
01:38:02,541 --> 01:38:03,750
I think you should go there.

1332
01:38:58,375 --> 01:39:00,833
Mitha stays quite happy these days.

1333
01:39:01,166 --> 01:39:04,000
All this is thanks to German.

1334
01:39:15,875 --> 01:39:17,125
By the way,

1335
01:39:19,416 --> 01:39:21,000
For helping Mitha.

1336
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:23,916
I know.

1337
01:39:24,958 --> 01:39:27,416
But that doesn't mean
that now I stand a chance.

1338
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:34,708
Father's calling.

1339
01:39:41,291 --> 01:39:42,208
Geet.

1340
01:39:44,166 --> 01:39:45,833
Ricky was good.

1341
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:48,875
But German is very good.

1342
01:40:08,291 --> 01:40:10,791
<i>Geet. Ricky was good.</i>

1343
01:40:10,875 --> 01:40:13,500
<i>But German is very good.</i>

1344
01:40:48,041 --> 01:40:49,708
This necklace belonged to my mother.

1345
01:40:52,583 --> 01:40:54,875
She wanted her daughter-in-law to wear it.

1346
01:41:11,375 --> 01:41:12,333
Geet!

1347
01:41:13,250 --> 01:41:15,416
Where are you?
Come here. I want to talk to you.

1348
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:16,458
Come here.

1349
01:41:18,833 --> 01:41:19,958
Sit down.

1350
01:41:21,958 --> 01:41:23,791
Look at this. Isn't this teddy very cute?

1351
01:41:24,208 --> 01:41:26,416
-Yes, mom.
-And look at this one.

1352
01:41:29,791 --> 01:41:32,833
Look at these. A few baby pictures.

1353
01:41:34,625 --> 01:41:35,875
Isn't this baby very cute?

1354
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,500
Look at this one. This one is so cute.

1355
01:41:56,916 --> 01:42:01,833
Geet, every parent dreams
of getting their children married,

1356
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:07,625
in a grand way.

1357
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:12,625
This dream of mine couldn't come true.

1358
01:42:17,166 --> 01:42:19,000
But now I won't listen to you.

1359
01:42:23,583 --> 01:42:28,333
To welcome my grandchild,

1360
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,833
I'll decorate this whole house.

1361
01:42:47,875 --> 01:42:49,541
Get ready quickly.

1362
01:42:49,750 --> 01:42:52,791
Your papa wants to go to the Gurudwara.

1363
01:42:53,166 --> 01:42:54,416
Get ready quickly.

1364
01:42:55,791 --> 01:42:57,083
I'll wait for you.

1365
01:43:24,708 --> 01:43:27,000
Listen, your father seems to be
in a good mood today.

1366
01:43:27,083 --> 01:43:28,208
I suggest you should talk to him.

1367
01:44:10,833 --> 01:44:14,000
Khalsa belongs to Lord.
Victory belongs to Lord.

1368
01:44:14,083 --> 01:44:16,916
Babaji, my daughter is pregnant.

1369
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,625
We want you to pray for her good health.

1370
01:44:36,541 --> 01:44:38,791
<i>You said this lie</i>

1371
01:44:39,375 --> 01:44:41,583
<i>in front of mummy and daddy.</i>

1372
01:44:42,125 --> 01:44:45,916
<i>Oh my God,</i>
<i>how many lies have I said in front of you?</i>

1373
01:46:07,333 --> 01:46:08,250
Geet!

1374
01:46:08,833 --> 01:46:10,250
What happened, dear?

1375
01:46:10,791 --> 01:46:14,208
Geet! Why are you crying?
Tell me what's wrong with you!

1376
01:46:14,791 --> 01:46:15,833
Geet!

1377
01:46:16,458 --> 01:46:17,833
Why are you crying, dear? Tell me.

1378
01:46:17,916 --> 01:46:20,875
Geet! Are you feeling alright?

1379
01:46:21,166 --> 01:46:22,666
I don't know why she is crying.

1380
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:24,375
Tell us.

1381
01:46:26,708 --> 01:46:28,000
Why are you crying?

1382
01:46:30,791 --> 01:46:32,208
Yes?

1383
01:46:34,583 --> 01:46:35,875
No, papa.

1384
01:46:37,666 --> 01:46:39,333
I am not alright.

1385
01:46:47,083 --> 01:46:49,958
The truth is that
the immigration department

1386
01:46:50,041 --> 01:46:52,916
knows that German and my marriage
is a fake one.

1387
01:46:53,625 --> 01:46:56,125
They have asked us
to come to their office on Monday.

1388
01:46:56,208 --> 01:46:59,000
And you and mummy also have to be there.

1389
01:46:59,958 --> 01:47:03,208
We lie that I am pregnant
so that we could stay here.

1390
01:47:10,833 --> 01:47:13,250
You could have told us the truth.

1391
01:47:13,791 --> 01:47:16,583
How many more lies
will the two of you tell us?

1392
01:47:18,583 --> 01:47:22,000
I still doubt whether or not
you are telling me the truth now.

1393
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,500
Look at your child, Satwant Kaur.

1394
01:47:27,458 --> 01:47:30,916
You two should be ashamed
for playing with our emotions.

1395
01:47:32,750 --> 01:47:34,708
I can never forgive the two of you.

1396
01:47:37,666 --> 01:47:38,541
Get lost from here!

1397
01:47:40,291 --> 01:47:43,791
Satwant, ask them to leave
or you will see me dead.

1398
01:47:47,541 --> 01:47:48,958
Papa, please. Forgive them.

1399
01:47:49,041 --> 01:47:50,250
You stay out of this, Mitha!

1400
01:47:55,583 --> 01:47:58,666
You two should leave. Go away.

1401
01:48:32,958 --> 01:48:38,458
<i>Each moment feels like a decade</i>

1402
01:48:38,708 --> 01:48:43,416
<i>My body is alive</i>
<i>But my heart is slowly dying</i>

1403
01:48:43,791 --> 01:48:48,416
<i>I cannot find any support</i>

1404
01:48:48,666 --> 01:48:54,208
<i>I cannot find any support</i>

1405
01:48:54,291 --> 01:48:58,458
<i>Even God has refused to help us</i>

1406
01:48:58,791 --> 01:48:59,791
<i>My dear</i>

1407
01:49:01,166 --> 01:49:05,458
<i>First you built</i>
<i>Our own little world with love</i>

1408
01:49:05,666 --> 01:49:11,166
<i>First you built</i>
<i>Our own little world with love</i>

1409
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:14,625
<i>Then you broke our trust</i>

1410
01:49:14,708 --> 01:49:17,125
<i>This isn't right, my dear</i>

1411
01:49:17,208 --> 01:49:20,416
<i>Then you broke our trust</i>

1412
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:23,291
<i>This isn't right, my dear</i>

1413
01:49:23,375 --> 01:49:26,041
<i>Not fair</i>

1414
01:49:26,291 --> 01:49:28,708
<i>Not fair</i>

1415
01:49:28,791 --> 01:49:31,833
<i>This isn't right, my dear</i>

1416
01:49:31,916 --> 01:49:34,291
<i>Not fair</i>

1417
01:49:34,375 --> 01:49:37,291
<i>This isn't right, my dear</i>

1418
01:49:37,583 --> 01:49:40,375
<i>Yes, this isn't fair</i>

1419
01:50:03,875 --> 01:50:06,666
<i>Why dream when I know</i>

1420
01:50:06,750 --> 01:50:09,541
<i>My dreams will break</i>

1421
01:50:09,625 --> 01:50:12,416
<i>All the hopes I had</i>

1422
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:15,458
<i>Will shatter</i>

1423
01:50:20,916 --> 01:50:23,750
<i>Why dream when I know</i>

1424
01:50:23,833 --> 01:50:27,041
<i>My dreams will break</i>

1425
01:50:27,125 --> 01:50:32,375
<i>All the hopes I had will shatter</i>

1426
01:50:32,458 --> 01:50:37,125
<i>We were only meant</i>
<i>To be together for so long</i>

1427
01:50:37,416 --> 01:50:42,583
<i>We were only meant</i>
<i>To be together for so long</i>

1428
01:50:43,208 --> 01:50:48,125
<i>You squeezed life out of me</i>
<i>This isn't right, my dear</i>

1429
01:50:48,625 --> 01:50:51,708
<i>You squeezed life out of me</i>

1430
01:50:51,791 --> 01:50:54,500
<i>This isn't right, my dear</i>

1431
01:50:54,750 --> 01:50:57,208
<i>Not fair</i>

1432
01:50:57,708 --> 01:51:00,041
<i>Not fair</i>

1433
01:51:00,125 --> 01:51:03,375
<i>This isn't right, my dear</i>

1434
01:51:03,583 --> 01:51:05,750
<i>Not fair</i>

1435
01:51:05,833 --> 01:51:08,875
<i>This isn't right, my dear</i>

1436
01:51:08,958 --> 01:51:12,333
<i>Yes, this isn't fair</i>

1437
01:51:23,375 --> 01:51:26,333
<i>My eyes have forgotten how to sleep,</i>
<i>My love</i>

1438
01:51:26,416 --> 01:51:29,166
<i>Now even the fans blow out hot air</i>

1439
01:51:29,250 --> 01:51:31,708
<i>My eyes have forgotten how to sleep,</i>
<i>My love</i>

1440
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,750
<i>Now even the fans blow out hot air</i>

1441
01:51:34,833 --> 01:51:37,833
<i>I keep treasuring your memories</i>

1442
01:51:38,125 --> 01:51:40,916
<i>After helping</i>

1443
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,708
<i>After helping</i>

1444
01:51:43,791 --> 01:51:48,500
<i>After helping the kite of my life soar</i>

1445
01:51:49,541 --> 01:51:54,041
<i>After helping the kite of my life soar</i>

1446
01:51:54,416 --> 01:51:59,541
<i>If you let go of the thread</i>
<i>Then it isn't right, my dear</i>

1447
01:52:00,125 --> 01:52:05,291
<i>If you let go of the thread</i>
<i>Then it isn't right, my dear</i>

1448
01:52:06,250 --> 01:52:09,083
<i>Not fair</i>

1449
01:52:09,166 --> 01:52:11,625
<i>Not fair</i>

1450
01:52:11,916 --> 01:52:14,791
<i>This isn't right, my dear</i>

1451
01:52:14,875 --> 01:52:17,166
<i>Not fair</i>

1452
01:52:17,250 --> 01:52:20,333
<i>This isn't right, my dear</i>

1453
01:52:20,416 --> 01:52:23,458
<i>Yes, this isn't fair</i>

1454
01:52:28,291 --> 01:52:29,833
It's not Geet's fault.

1455
01:52:29,916 --> 01:52:33,125
She did all this to save her life
and your honor.

1456
01:52:34,250 --> 01:52:35,583
It was my fault.

1457
01:52:35,666 --> 01:52:37,750
I lied to you and said
that Geet was pregnant.

1458
01:52:39,375 --> 01:52:41,208
Whether or not you forgive me,

1459
01:52:42,083 --> 01:52:43,875
you should forgive Geet.

1460
01:52:45,666 --> 01:52:48,166
Because when kids from good families
end up in prison,

1461
01:52:48,666 --> 01:52:50,208
then you lose your reputation.

1462
01:52:55,833 --> 01:52:59,041
Geet, you like vegetables, right?

1463
01:53:02,625 --> 01:53:05,666
And what's that you eat
applying peanuts on the bread?

1464
01:53:05,750 --> 01:53:06,708
What is it called?

1465
01:53:12,291 --> 01:53:13,291
Peanut.

1466
01:53:14,833 --> 01:53:17,791
And what do you eat with milk?

1467
01:53:18,416 --> 01:53:19,500
Corn flakes.

1468
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:34,875
Please forgive me, Geet.

1469
01:53:37,333 --> 01:53:40,000
I always get caught when I lie,
since childhood.

1470
01:53:42,875 --> 01:53:44,916
You had gotten me the citizenship.

1471
01:53:46,708 --> 01:53:48,166
It was I who couldn't do the right thing.

1472
01:53:55,916 --> 01:53:56,833
No.

1473
01:53:57,958 --> 01:53:59,416
It is my fault.

1474
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:03,833
I shouldn't have gone back to Lakkha.

1475
01:54:08,708 --> 01:54:11,000
I was never worthy of you.

1476
01:54:11,250 --> 01:54:12,541
And I never will be.

1477
01:54:20,958 --> 01:54:22,708
I will be arrested tomorrow.

1478
01:54:26,250 --> 01:54:28,875
You will be deported to Punjab.

1479
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,875
That means we will never meet again

1480
01:54:42,750 --> 01:54:46,333
Forgive me for all the stupidity,

1481
01:54:47,166 --> 01:54:48,500
for all the mistakes I have done.

1482
01:54:52,583 --> 01:54:56,916
If you ever come to India again
then do pay us a visit.

1483
01:55:35,541 --> 01:55:36,958
There are five questions on this sheet.

1484
01:55:37,041 --> 01:55:39,000
Answer them and give it back to me.

1485
01:55:39,083 --> 01:55:41,500
Then I will ask you
about each other's life.

1486
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,666
Your parents didn't come, Geet?

1487
01:56:14,291 --> 01:56:16,875
-They won't be coming.
-I knew that this is a sham marriage.

1488
01:56:20,500 --> 01:56:22,375
You are fooling the UK government.

1489
01:56:22,916 --> 01:56:25,666
I'll make sure both of you get punished.

1490
01:56:36,708 --> 01:56:40,333
Geet had come to Punjab
in May to marry me.

1491
01:56:40,875 --> 01:56:41,833
I had given her 1.7 million rupees.

1492
01:56:44,208 --> 01:56:46,166
We got married and came to the UK.

1493
01:56:47,375 --> 01:56:48,291
And we no longer live together.

1494
01:56:55,791 --> 01:56:57,208
This is what you think, Brinda.

1495
01:56:57,625 --> 01:57:00,625
But we live together
at her parents' house.

1496
01:57:00,708 --> 01:57:03,500
She is my real wife.
Our marriage is not a sham.

1497
01:57:05,208 --> 01:57:08,166
Papa, you came!

1498
01:57:13,250 --> 01:57:16,833
Mother, thank you for not letting
your anger get the better of you.

1499
01:57:18,125 --> 01:57:21,500
Be careful, dear.
This is the question of your life.

1500
01:57:21,583 --> 01:57:22,458
Okay, mom.

1501
01:57:23,208 --> 01:57:24,166
Let's go.

1502
01:57:41,041 --> 01:57:42,791
Nothing. You start the interview.

1503
01:57:44,458 --> 01:57:47,500
Geet, what's German's qualification?

1504
01:57:56,125 --> 01:57:57,375
He's gone to high school.

1505
01:58:01,625 --> 01:58:03,125
His biggest weakness.

1506
01:58:11,375 --> 01:58:14,416
German's biggest weakness

1507
01:58:16,041 --> 01:58:19,041
is that he cannot lie.

1508
01:58:28,125 --> 01:58:29,958
His biggest dream?

1509
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:34,833
His biggest dream

1510
01:58:37,708 --> 01:58:41,125
has always been to get out of India.

1511
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
What's German's shoe size?

1512
01:58:57,166 --> 01:58:58,291
His shoe size?

1513
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:09,833
German, you have mentioned
it as eight and a quarter.

1514
01:59:10,833 --> 01:59:13,958
Ms. Brinda, let me explain.
My shoe size is eight and a quarter.

1515
01:59:15,208 --> 01:59:16,125
I stuff these to make them fit.

1516
01:59:17,708 --> 01:59:18,666
You can put anything.

1517
01:59:18,750 --> 01:59:21,916
A rag, a rolled up sock?

1518
01:59:22,833 --> 01:59:24,208
So it is eight and a half that way.

1519
01:59:26,041 --> 01:59:27,208
I told you it is eight and a quarter.

1520
01:59:27,291 --> 01:59:28,333
When did you say it?

1521
01:59:31,541 --> 01:59:35,333
Geet, what was the name
of German's last girlfriend?

1522
01:59:59,291 --> 02:00:01,958
German, now I will ask you five questions.

1523
02:00:07,125 --> 02:00:08,041
Okay.

1524
02:00:10,375 --> 02:00:12,333
Which game does Geet like the most?

1525
02:00:12,625 --> 02:00:14,291
Basketball. Ask me why.

1526
02:00:15,666 --> 02:00:16,583
Okay, I'll tell you.

1527
02:00:16,666 --> 02:00:20,583
Tall girls like her either play basketball
or clean ceiling fans.

1528
02:00:26,250 --> 02:00:28,000
Geet had a boyfriend. What was his name?

1529
02:00:28,083 --> 02:00:30,750
I know everything about him.

1530
02:00:30,833 --> 02:00:33,083
What was his name? Ricky Manchanda.

1531
02:00:33,166 --> 02:00:35,000
He lives in Manchester with his cousin.

1532
02:00:35,083 --> 02:00:37,833
His village is close to Jalandhar,
Zandu Singha.

1533
02:00:37,916 --> 02:00:40,000
He is into quite a few illegal activities.

1534
02:00:40,083 --> 02:00:41,875
He cheats rich girls.

1535
02:00:41,958 --> 02:00:42,916
Pull up such cheap tricks.

1536
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:44,166
There isn't any bad thing he doesn't do.

1537
02:00:47,083 --> 02:00:49,208
At the moment, what's the balance
in Geet's bank account?

1538
02:00:49,416 --> 02:00:50,333
Zilch.

1539
02:00:52,208 --> 02:00:55,875
Nothing. You must be wondering that
I gave her 1.7 million rupees

1540
02:00:55,958 --> 02:00:58,125
so she must have a hefty bank balance.
Zero.

1541
02:00:58,208 --> 02:01:00,333
Eighty-five times zero is also zero.

1542
02:01:00,916 --> 02:01:02,750
Nothing.
I mean she doesn't have any money.

1543
02:01:02,833 --> 02:01:03,833
Empty account.

1544
02:01:10,291 --> 02:01:11,291
What is she saying?

1545
02:01:11,583 --> 02:01:13,666
She's asking what's my body weight.

1546
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,083
-Tell her.
-Shameless. She is asking you.

1547
02:01:17,666 --> 02:01:19,166
-One load full.
-What?

1548
02:01:19,708 --> 02:01:20,583
Shut...

1549
02:01:27,083 --> 02:01:30,333
What's the most precious thing
in Geet's life?

1550
02:01:31,583 --> 02:01:32,541
What is she saying?

1551
02:01:33,375 --> 02:01:35,958
She is asking what's
the most precious thing?

1552
02:01:37,250 --> 02:01:38,375
My mother's necklace.

1553
02:01:48,708 --> 02:01:50,541
-For whom did she mean?
-Me.

1554
02:01:51,875 --> 02:01:53,250
I told her about myself.

1555
02:01:57,291 --> 02:01:58,583
I too had written the same reply.

1556
02:02:28,458 --> 02:02:31,500
Mrs. Satwant Kaur,
what's German's mother's age?

1557
02:02:32,083 --> 02:02:33,000
Well...

1558
02:02:35,166 --> 02:02:39,125
German was quite young
when his mother passed away.

1559
02:02:41,541 --> 02:02:42,875
Mr. Hardayal Kahlon.

1560
02:02:43,166 --> 02:02:45,500
What was the first job German took up
in the UK?

1561
02:02:46,666 --> 02:02:51,250
German's first job in the UK,
he was a truck driver.

1562
02:02:59,625 --> 02:03:01,166
-Okay.
-Goodbye.

1563
02:03:01,250 --> 02:03:03,791
Brinda, just ask everything you want now.

1564
02:03:03,875 --> 02:03:05,083
Or else she would keep troubling us.

1565
02:03:05,583 --> 02:03:06,583
She is through.

1566
02:03:06,666 --> 02:03:08,291
No daddy, she might come back
and ask questions again.

1567
02:03:08,375 --> 02:03:09,833
Let's end this once and for all.
You ask whatever you want.

1568
02:03:09,916 --> 02:03:11,625
She is through. Let's go.

1569
02:03:11,708 --> 02:03:13,083
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

1570
02:03:13,166 --> 02:03:14,666
Thank you.

1571
02:03:18,333 --> 02:03:21,791
Just you guys wait here,
I am coming with the car.

1572
02:03:27,875 --> 02:03:29,333
You guys still married?

1573
02:03:29,625 --> 02:03:30,666
Strange!

1574
02:03:30,750 --> 02:03:32,750
Will I for others only?
I can't get married life

1575
02:03:32,833 --> 02:03:34,416
Won't I get married and settle down?

1576
02:03:35,750 --> 02:03:38,583
-I mean my better half, Pari.
-Then what are you doing here?

1577
02:03:38,666 --> 02:03:40,791
I've come to the immigration office
for an interview.

1578
02:03:41,916 --> 02:03:43,708
I need to become a citizen.
Wait, you scoundrel.

1579
02:03:43,791 --> 02:03:45,708
-Just joking.
-You kept me worrying for six months!

1580
02:03:45,791 --> 02:03:46,833
-He is very emotional!
-What do you think you are!

1581
02:03:46,916 --> 02:03:49,083
Brother,
you can say whatever you want.

1582
02:03:49,166 --> 02:03:50,083
You have citizenship.

1583
02:03:50,166 --> 02:03:54,166
What do you know about the sorrows
of soldiers like us in England?

1584
02:03:54,958 --> 02:03:56,125
Let's go, Pari.

1585
02:03:56,208 --> 02:03:57,458
We shouldn't waste time
talking to rustic people.

1586
02:03:58,833 --> 02:04:00,875
Let's go? Shall we?

1587
02:04:11,958 --> 02:04:16,000
<i>Your tresses are like a mesmerizing snake</i>

1588
02:04:16,083 --> 02:04:19,583
<i>Your reflection is imprinted</i>

1589
02:04:19,666 --> 02:04:23,625

<i>Your reflection is imprinted</i>

1593
02:04:33,875 --> 02:04:36,166
<i>In the waters of my village</i>

1594
02:04:38,458 --> 02:04:40,083
<i>Your reflection</i>

1595
02:04:41,625 --> 02:04:44,250
<i>A glass bottle</i>

1596
02:04:44,333 --> 02:04:47,041
<i>A glass bottle filled with perfume</i>

1597
02:04:47,541 --> 02:04:51,583
<i>Talk about a lifetime of togetherness,</i>
<i>Don't be hasty</i>

1598
02:04:51,666 --> 02:04:55,041
<i>Talk about a lifetime of togetherness</i>

1599
02:04:55,291 --> 02:04:58,958

<i>Like child's play, don't use me for fun</i>

1603
02:05:23,041 --> 02:05:28,583
<i>You steal hearts with your enchanting eyes</i>
<i>You are a clever one</i>

1604
02:05:29,125 --> 02:05:34,125
<i>You steal hearts with your enchanting eyes</i>
<i>You are a clever one</i>

1605
02:05:34,791 --> 02:05:38,791
<i>You steal hearts with your enchanting eyes</i>

1606
02:05:39,041 --> 02:05:41,291
<i>You are a clever one</i>

1607
02:05:52,666 --> 02:05:58,541
<i>One glance and your soul belongs to me</i>

1608
02:05:58,625 --> 02:06:04,166
<i>My sight is like a well</i>
<i>Filled with sweet nectar</i>

1609

1612
02:06:31,125 --> 02:06:37,000
<i>Beautiful tall damsels</i>

1616
02:06:48,875 --> 02:06:53,000
<i>I rule the land of beauty</i>

1617
02:06:53,416 --> 02:06:56,458
<i>The sky is my veil</i>

1618
02:06:56,791 --> 02:07:00,541
<i>And the swings my tresses</i>

1619
