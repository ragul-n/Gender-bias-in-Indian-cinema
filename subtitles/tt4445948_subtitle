1
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:41,754
This Universe...

2
00:01:41,921 --> 00:01:45,550
...is a vast forest filled
with many mysteries

3
00:01:50,283 --> 00:01:53,008
The change in time
occurs with the help of...

4
00:01:53,285 --> 00:01:53,785
Land

5
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:54,822
Water

6
00:01:55,164 --> 00:01:55,664
Fire

7
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:56,830
Air

8
00:01:57,288 --> 00:01:57,788
Space

9
00:01:58,107 --> 00:02:01,297
The five elements of nature

10
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,671
In concurrance with this occurs the...

11
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,852
...planetary and other
celestial events.

12
00:02:07,095 --> 00:02:12,793
Every second of these events decides
man's path of life on earth.

13
00:02:13,054 --> 00:02:18,612
A man with the wisdom of these
happenings lived in South India...

14
00:02:18,886 --> 00:02:20,567
Veera Bramenthirar

15
00:02:20,592 --> 00:02:23,589
People called him the
Scholar of Time.

16
00:02:23,803 --> 00:02:29,479
He laid down the guidelines of Time
in a mysterious book named 'Wisdom of Time'

17
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,014
With the help of this, he
had predicted many events

18
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:36,898
The Wisdom of Time and
the guidelines of

19
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:40,067
prediction were learnt
from Veera Bramenthira...

20
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:43,163
...by five eminent people
and one amongst them was...

21
00:02:43,283 --> 00:02:48,595
...The greatest King of
South India, Rajasimhan.

22
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:57,256
It was the time when the
wealth of India was...

23
00:02:57,672 --> 00:03:01,812
.....envied by many other countries.

24
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,224
Especially...

25
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:04,583
East India Company

26
00:03:04,903 --> 00:03:08,849
It was the time of the company's
strong foothold in India.

27
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:11,529
The final war...

28
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:13,654
Furious battlefields

29
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:19,903
Many of the kingdoms were
falling to the British

30
00:03:20,073 --> 00:03:22,658
During the final stages of downfall...

31
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:27,992
The great warrior who stood as a
challenge for the British was...

32
00:03:28,546 --> 00:03:29,849
Rajasimhan.

33
00:03:38,148 --> 00:03:40,780
He worships Time

34
00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:43,123
He was eminent in the
strategies of war

35
00:03:44,195 --> 00:03:46,910
He has learnt the Science of Astrology

36
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:50,125
The greatest king of
Southern Tamilnadu.

37
00:03:51,937 --> 00:03:53,143
Rajasimhan

38
00:04:13,685 --> 00:04:19,623
In the final war, he posed great challenges
to the enemies and destructed their morale.

39
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:28,856
Our clan is known for its
courage as well as treachery.

40
00:04:29,142 --> 00:04:33,941
Due to the treachery of
his childhood friend and

41
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:39,253
Commander of his army, Karuna,
the army faced defeat.

42
00:04:47,022 --> 00:04:50,041
With the wisdom of predicting
the future, he was

43
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:52,960
unable to predict the
treachery of his friend.

44
00:04:53,657 --> 00:04:58,982
The British ordered
Rajasimhan to be hanged.

45
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,158
Upon escaping from the punishment,

46
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:14,624
He went into an exile and met his guru and
fatherly figure Mohammed Bin Basheer.

47
00:05:15,338 --> 00:05:16,829
In this land filled with treachery,

48
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:19,797
my life should not fall into
the hands of the enemy.

49
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:25,006
My soul and my works will
never leave this world.

50
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:32,962
As his final wish, he
ordered to be buried alive.

51
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,563
According to the guidelines of
time and with the concurrence

52
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:44,171
of the elements of nature,
his wish was fulfilled.

53
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:53,630
The spirits of the brave and having dealt
with treachery, yearns for one thing...

54
00:05:54,341 --> 00:06:00,003
To seek revenge is the most honest feeling.

55
00:06:51,547 --> 00:06:51,991
Hello?

56
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,341
Selvakumar.

57
00:06:57,612 --> 00:06:59,612
The follower...

58
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,400
How's it going?

59
00:07:02,294 --> 00:07:04,500
Don't bother about who I am.

60
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,841
If you do,

61
00:07:06,472 --> 00:07:09,376
everything around you will
burn, just like this.

62
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:12,388
Behave yourself and get
on the bike behind you.

63
00:07:17,092 --> 00:07:18,092
Hop on.

64
00:07:55,772 --> 00:07:56,398
Get down!

65
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:00,475
Come.

66
00:08:01,511 --> 00:08:02,511
Go.

67
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:04,732
What's with the look?

68
00:08:05,294 --> 00:08:05,611
Go on.

69
00:08:07,576 --> 00:08:08,115
Get going.

70
00:08:28,924 --> 00:08:30,820
Who spoke to me on the phone?

71
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:31,918
John.

72
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:33,832
John Christopher.

73
00:09:02,216 --> 00:09:03,931
On this cold night,

74
00:09:04,554 --> 00:09:06,466
my motor bike that was burnt,

75
00:09:07,294 --> 00:09:10,630
the phone call that followed,

76
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:12,299
his name,

77
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,270
and this room.

78
00:09:14,614 --> 00:09:18,058
I'm sure none of this
is related to me.

79
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:21,155
My name is Selva.

80
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:22,927
I'm from Madurai.

81
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,287
The only thing I
lacked back then.

82
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:26,360
A job.

83
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:28,523
JOB

84
00:09:29,407 --> 00:09:31,168
Just One Break.

85
00:09:40,348 --> 00:09:43,054
The education that has
left me unemployed is

86
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:51,214
B.E (Bachelor in Engineering).

87
00:09:54,058 --> 00:09:55,769
I completed that useless course

88
00:09:56,558 --> 00:09:58,137
and couldn't find the right job.

89
00:09:58,869 --> 00:09:59,869
So I came to Chennai.

90
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:02,187
My first identity in Chennai

91
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,412
is this Tea stall.

92
00:10:05,219 --> 00:10:06,885
Hey, can I get some water?

93
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:10,718
Hey! Can I get some water?!

94
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:12,329
Why are you asking him?

95
00:10:15,023 --> 00:10:15,940
Here.

96
00:10:29,548 --> 00:10:30,405
One tea.

97
00:10:30,955 --> 00:10:31,828
In a glass.

98
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,693
Do you want tea?

99
00:10:35,856 --> 00:10:36,324
Coffee.

100
00:10:40,044 --> 00:10:41,401
One strong coffee.

101
00:10:43,223 --> 00:10:44,294
I prefer it light.

102
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:46,786
Did you hear that?

103
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,042
Sir, coffee.

104
00:11:02,524 --> 00:11:03,524
Sir, your name?

105
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:05,326
Name?

106
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:06,295
Bill Gates.

107
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:12,725
Selva.

108
00:11:13,164 --> 00:11:14,362
Hey, Sudha.

109
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:16,191
- Greetings.
- How are you?

110
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,196
This is our room.

111
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,409
The man you saw downstairs
is the landlord.

112
00:11:23,781 --> 00:11:24,630
A good man.

113
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:25,804
Come in.

114
00:11:26,455 --> 00:11:27,455
We have no troubles.

115
00:11:39,327 --> 00:11:42,152
Kids in the neighbourhood
play cricket and it gets in.

116
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,598
I keep it, so that
we can play too.

117
00:11:48,422 --> 00:11:49,422
May I come in?

118
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:51,630
Just get in.

119
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,924
I've told you about
him, he's Selva.

120
00:11:55,974 --> 00:11:57,546
- Schoolmate. - Hello.
- He has done B.E.

121
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,831
He's here for an interview.

122
00:11:59,726 --> 00:12:01,115
This is Venkat.

123
00:12:01,238 --> 00:12:02,388
He's a medical rep.

124
00:12:02,413 --> 00:12:03,956
- Okay.
- We're in the same field.

125
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:05,918
Can we share it?

126
00:12:06,168 --> 00:12:07,168
Don't irritate me.

127
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:10,549
All this drinking will
make you impotent.

128
00:12:18,157 --> 00:12:19,323
In such a short time

129
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:21,026
I couldn't get the right job

130
00:12:21,902 --> 00:12:22,711
here.

131
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:39,552
Can we have tea?

132
00:12:40,397 --> 00:12:42,124
We have work, you go drink.

133
00:12:44,323 --> 00:12:46,061
Are you trying to say I'm jobless?

134
00:12:46,556 --> 00:12:47,103
B.E.

135
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,981
A job that matches
your education right?

136
00:12:49,524 --> 00:12:51,087
I only completed school.

137
00:12:51,574 --> 00:12:52,907
They called me a driver.

138
00:12:53,716 --> 00:12:55,120
After I joined the
Ambulance service

139
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,190
they call me a Pilot.

140
00:12:57,033 --> 00:12:58,548
My life changed in a day.

141
00:12:59,235 --> 00:13:00,599
Go out in the street and scream.

142
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,442
Ask people if they studied B.E.

143
00:13:02,826 --> 00:13:04,532
Half of them would have.

144
00:13:05,841 --> 00:13:08,468
So many advises and hobbies,

145
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:11,165
so many faces and so
many experiences.

146
00:13:12,384 --> 00:13:13,431
Despite all this,

147
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:15,708
finally in an interview,

148
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,102
I reached the final round.

149
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,013
- Do you want some tea?
- Boost.

150
00:13:31,106 --> 00:13:31,915
Boost.

151
00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:34,759
A boost as well.

152
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:37,601
So? What is the headline?

153
00:13:38,348 --> 00:13:41,030
The value of the Indian
Rupee has dropped.

154
00:13:42,673 --> 00:13:44,005
Economical graph down.

155
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,699
Here's the boost.

156
00:13:47,033 --> 00:13:49,216
Sir can drink boost
only I suppose.

157
00:13:49,377 --> 00:13:49,940
Give it.

158
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,244
Sir, boost.

159
00:13:54,057 --> 00:13:55,485
Sir, what do you do for lunch?

160
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,540
I have two more idiots like you.

161
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,337
They take care of it.

162
00:14:02,364 --> 00:14:03,364
Sarcastic much.

163
00:14:04,985 --> 00:14:05,468
Hey

164
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,147
I'll drop you.

165
00:14:08,211 --> 00:14:09,560
We need to go to
Velachery, quick.

166
00:14:09,657 --> 00:14:10,363
Bye sir.

167
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:13,953
- Okay bro, good luck.
- Bye.

168
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:15,646
Get going.

169
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,148
Another American slave.

170
00:14:23,181 --> 00:14:25,514
I knew, that
they would do this.

171
00:14:25,747 --> 00:14:26,977
It was the same last time.

172
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:30,852
They promised a job and took
60,000 as fees for the course.

173
00:14:31,024 --> 00:14:34,261
And then they gave 5,000 every month
from that money and ran away.

174
00:14:34,286 --> 00:14:36,763
This is how they fool the
people from rural areas.

175
00:14:36,813 --> 00:14:38,209
This is just to get
our attention.

176
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,700
They said they needed 47 people.

177
00:14:39,807 --> 00:14:41,442
They selected only 3 of them.

178
00:14:41,467 --> 00:14:43,858
And they happened to be
women, are we fools?

179
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,970
That damn bald HR!

180
00:14:46,058 --> 00:14:48,402
If I get a hold of
him I'll thrash him!

181
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,587
So

182
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,119
when are you joining?

183
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:53,844
Hey! Damn!

184
00:14:54,473 --> 00:14:55,282
I'm good.

185
00:14:56,418 --> 00:14:57,830
It's just about a girl.

186
00:14:58,136 --> 00:14:58,929
I'll handle it.

187
00:14:59,527 --> 00:15:00,693
Yeah, sure. Okay.

188
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,188
How much?

189
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:06,410
Make sure you give
it to the driver.

190
00:15:08,471 --> 00:15:10,296
Sir, do you need to
go to the hospital?

191
00:15:10,491 --> 00:15:12,800
God! I'll never drink again.

192
00:15:14,305 --> 00:15:15,305
Who asked you to?

193
00:15:15,726 --> 00:15:17,003
Watch yourself!

194
00:15:18,206 --> 00:15:20,214
If you break the heads of HRs

195
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:21,627
there won't be one
to recruit you.

196
00:15:22,845 --> 00:15:23,535
Thank you sir.

197
00:15:23,942 --> 00:15:24,942
You didn't drink?

198
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:26,728
You finished it all. We're
just about to start.

199
00:15:34,132 --> 00:15:35,790
The entire building got burnt?

200
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:36,815
Didn't you watch the news?

201
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:38,177
The entire building!

202
00:15:39,168 --> 00:15:40,731
The media was there as well.

203
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:42,792
It was full of papers.

204
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:44,139
Hence it caught fire quickly.

205
00:15:44,303 --> 00:15:47,560
I'm selling whatever was
left from that building.

206
00:15:47,585 --> 00:15:48,585
What's in the bucket?

207
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:49,800
Oh that!

208
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:52,357
I was told that it
was an old book.

209
00:15:52,382 --> 00:15:53,524
It was on fire.

210
00:15:53,725 --> 00:15:55,768
I didn't want the
other books to burn.

211
00:15:55,793 --> 00:15:57,311
Hence I put it in water.

212
00:15:57,425 --> 00:15:58,843
And the cover is
made of leather.

213
00:15:59,216 --> 00:16:00,740
So I just put it in water.

214
00:16:01,022 --> 00:16:02,831
Including that

215
00:16:03,235 --> 00:16:04,587
take 2,000 rupees.

216
00:16:04,612 --> 00:16:05,151
Here.

217
00:16:05,448 --> 00:16:07,337
Sir, you're paying me less.

218
00:16:07,615 --> 00:16:09,106
That itself is a lot.

219
00:16:09,131 --> 00:16:10,131
Keep it.

220
00:16:12,754 --> 00:16:14,158
Do visit again.

221
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:15,938
That's why I've
reduced the price.

222
00:16:19,405 --> 00:16:20,762
White phosphorous.

223
00:16:22,453 --> 00:16:23,302
Interesting.

224
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:51,467
I'm talking to you.

225
00:16:51,869 --> 00:16:54,376
What's with you and books?

226
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:58,275
I wonder what you made out
of this lending library.

227
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:00,538
I guess it's my fate.

228
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:27,627
My name is

229
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,093
John Christopher.

230
00:17:33,071 --> 00:17:34,824
A few years back,

231
00:17:34,866 --> 00:17:35,643
in Chennai,

232
00:17:35,883 --> 00:17:37,208
My only identity

233
00:17:37,425 --> 00:17:39,448
was unimaginably a tea stall.

234
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:50,191
Tea.

235
00:17:50,984 --> 00:17:52,579
TEA

236
00:17:53,425 --> 00:17:54,940
Total Earth Addiction.

237
00:17:55,939 --> 00:17:57,295
For an ordinary Indian,

238
00:17:57,495 --> 00:17:59,781
Tea is like blood.

239
00:18:00,729 --> 00:18:01,935
In short

240
00:18:02,197 --> 00:18:03,458
it's the blood of the low class.

241
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,200
In the history of our country,

242
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:07,645
a recurring object,

243
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:08,568
is this tea.

244
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,212
The tea I served
from that tea stall

245
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:14,826
introduced me to Mr. Rajagopal.

246
00:18:14,957 --> 00:18:15,774
Rajagopal.

247
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:20,112
He's the senior manager in the
loan section of a private bank.

248
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:23,480
I was often in his
line of sight.

249
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,399
He needed an agent to
collect the loans.

250
00:18:27,131 --> 00:18:29,345
I became that agent.

251
00:18:30,387 --> 00:18:32,420
Madam, Suresh?

252
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:33,668
Who is this?

253
00:18:37,037 --> 00:18:38,131
I resigned my job.

254
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:40,425
I'll settle it in 2 months.

255
00:18:40,844 --> 00:18:41,692
The coffee

256
00:18:42,374 --> 00:18:43,516
is really hot.

257
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:46,323
The baby..

258
00:18:47,772 --> 00:18:48,772
is in my hands.

259
00:18:50,812 --> 00:18:51,414
John!

260
00:18:52,488 --> 00:18:53,885
You have 30 minutes.

261
00:18:54,115 --> 00:18:55,930
- You settle the entire loan.
- How can I setttle all of a sudden?

262
00:18:56,112 --> 00:18:57,563
She has a lot of jewels.

263
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,242
Go to the pawn broker
and get the money.

264
00:19:00,493 --> 00:19:03,395
- Okay John. - Go!
- With these small jobs..

265
00:19:03,914 --> 00:19:06,619
I somehow managed to start
a full fledged agency.

266
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:10,111
The loans that the bank deem
are impossible to retrieve

267
00:19:10,294 --> 00:19:11,294
is our target.

268
00:19:14,151 --> 00:19:15,151
Apart from that,

269
00:19:15,383 --> 00:19:17,224
many loans that the bank rejects

270
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,040
were influenced by our agency

271
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:20,349
for approval.

272
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,662
Our job is to not just
to collect loans.

273
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:25,222
If it isn't paid back,

274
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:27,642
the first to be at your doorstep

275
00:19:28,062 --> 00:19:28,689
will be us.

276
00:19:31,165 --> 00:19:32,498
This growth of mine

277
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:33,910
is not just because of me.

278
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,002
My friend in the police force

279
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:36,875
Sasi.

280
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,275
My brother Solomon
as my right hand.

281
00:19:41,191 --> 00:19:44,087
And along with lawyer Seeni,
it was a formidable team.

282
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:52,185
I can't forget 2 things
in this whole world.

283
00:19:52,584 --> 00:19:53,832
One is money.

284
00:19:54,024 --> 00:19:55,238
And the other one is tea.

285
00:19:55,784 --> 00:19:56,859
These 2 things..

286
00:19:57,275 --> 00:20:01,093
turned my mind as their
unquestioning slave.

287
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:07,846
Son

288
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:09,185
Yes Ma'am.

289
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:10,963
Sir is not feeling well.

290
00:20:11,248 --> 00:20:13,236
We're going to
Mysore for 3 months

291
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:14,405
for his treatment.

292
00:20:14,876 --> 00:20:17,272
This was the last book
that he so fondly bought.

293
00:20:17,498 --> 00:20:19,847
There's no space at
home or at the shop.

294
00:20:20,544 --> 00:20:22,957
It would be nice if you could
keep them all in your house.

295
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:24,193
It is his request.

296
00:20:24,654 --> 00:20:26,989
Sure ma'am why not,
we'll take it upstairs.

297
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,317
Take care of him.

298
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:29,817
- Okay son.
- Convey my regards.

299
00:20:31,428 --> 00:20:31,793
Take it.

300
00:21:08,423 --> 00:21:10,408
I have been repeatedly telling
you that I don't have.

301
00:21:11,191 --> 00:21:12,692
Please go.

302
00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:15,273
Let's go.

303
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:18,474
- You're going to be alone, take care
- I will.

304
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:34,397
What a city!

305
00:21:36,877 --> 00:21:38,154
There are the frauds.

306
00:21:39,154 --> 00:21:40,245
There are the helpful ones too.

307
00:21:41,806 --> 00:21:43,700
My life has changed in one day.

308
00:21:47,112 --> 00:21:49,128
You still have much to see.

309
00:21:49,646 --> 00:21:50,178
Go.

310
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:55,578
Bye.

311
00:21:56,296 --> 00:21:58,288
If there's a day that
I wouldn't forget.

312
00:21:58,957 --> 00:21:59,869
It was that day.

313
00:22:00,316 --> 00:22:01,440
I remember well.

314
00:22:02,298 --> 00:22:03,402
It was a full moon day.

315
00:24:50,724 --> 00:24:52,602
Congratulations for all
the selected ones.

316
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:53,987
Listen carefully.

317
00:24:54,437 --> 00:24:59,146
These ten 'sevens' are going to
be life changing ones.

318
00:24:59,187 --> 00:25:01,024
Repeat my words.

319
00:25:01,516 --> 00:25:02,907
Seven.
- Seven..

320
00:25:03,075 --> 00:25:04,662
Seven.
- Seven..

321
00:25:04,976 --> 00:25:06,043
Seven
- Seven..

322
00:26:38,987 --> 00:26:40,148
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

323
00:26:40,762 --> 00:26:42,661
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

324
00:26:43,931 --> 00:26:44,931
Good morning.

325
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:03,296
Hello, is Reddy here?

326
00:27:03,436 --> 00:27:04,336
He's waiting.

327
00:27:04,647 --> 00:27:05,455
5 minutes.

328
00:27:07,984 --> 00:27:08,444
Reddy.

329
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:09,888
Let's go.

330
00:27:15,881 --> 00:27:16,301
Sir, tea.

331
00:27:35,939 --> 00:27:36,645
John

332
00:27:37,395 --> 00:27:38,395
No matter how big you are

333
00:27:38,721 --> 00:27:40,097
You don't seem to let go of tea.

334
00:27:43,394 --> 00:27:44,068
Sir

335
00:27:45,146 --> 00:27:46,683
You must not forget the past.

336
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:48,716
You must always remember it.

337
00:27:51,546 --> 00:27:52,886
In some way.

338
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:54,903
Alright

339
00:27:55,378 --> 00:27:56,746
What's up with that Reddy?

340
00:27:57,101 --> 00:27:58,224
The bank audit is coming up.

341
00:27:58,537 --> 00:27:59,750
I have to close the file.

342
00:27:59,985 --> 00:28:01,258
Try to conclude it before that.

343
00:28:01,432 --> 00:28:02,466
And the Press.

344
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:05,039
They're writing gossips about us.

345
00:28:07,988 --> 00:28:09,142
He's here.

346
00:28:09,973 --> 00:28:10,973
I'll let you know.

347
00:28:11,478 --> 00:28:12,478
- Please wait.
- Sure.

348
00:29:08,552 --> 00:29:09,418
What's up bro?

349
00:29:10,361 --> 00:29:12,045
It must have been
boring without us.

350
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:16,188
And bro,

351
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:17,583
a good news.

352
00:29:17,771 --> 00:29:18,577
I almost forgot.

353
00:29:18,968 --> 00:29:20,790
I met a friend's friend.

354
00:29:21,036 --> 00:29:21,758
Her name is Jennifer.

355
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,869
Their company is recruiting.

356
00:29:24,122 --> 00:29:24,990
She'll let me know.

357
00:29:25,534 --> 00:29:26,412
I'll give you her number.

358
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,103
Call her after 10.

359
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:30,027
Okay?

360
00:29:31,001 --> 00:29:32,800
Hey, take down the number.

361
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:40,640
Is this the age for origami?

362
00:29:49,584 --> 00:29:50,621
All the best bro.

363
00:29:53,612 --> 00:29:54,535
Don't fret over it.

364
00:29:54,739 --> 00:29:56,764
It's okay to do
whatever job you get.

365
00:30:22,135 --> 00:30:22,539
Hey

366
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:24,399
Hey

367
00:30:25,946 --> 00:30:26,422
Hey!

368
00:30:27,456 --> 00:30:28,361
Just Ask

369
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:31,975
Which floor is Just Ask in?

370
00:30:36,677 --> 00:30:37,506
2nd block?

371
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,711
3rd floor?

372
00:30:43,392 --> 00:30:44,633
Thanks man.

373
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:51,417
Thanks again.

374
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,602
- Hello.
- It's okay, sit.

375
00:31:01,457 --> 00:31:02,457
All set for the interview.

376
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,139
- Okay.
- Just attend the interview.

377
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:05,805
I'll take care of the rest.

378
00:31:06,721 --> 00:31:07,943
- Thanks.
- Adi..

379
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:09,493
You will guide Selva.

380
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:12,275
We'll meet in the evening.

381
00:31:13,351 --> 00:31:14,485
- All the best.
- Thank you.

382
00:31:15,644 --> 00:31:17,818
Damn these people
and the 'target'!

383
00:31:23,565 --> 00:31:24,168
Hello sir.

384
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:26,743
Thank you sir.

385
00:31:28,883 --> 00:31:30,253
My name is Selvakumar.

386
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,055
I studied B.E in Coimbatore.

387
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,846
I'm from Madurai, I'm
staying here in R.A. Puram.

388
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:36,880
I knew about the interview
through Jennifer..

389
00:31:57,522 --> 00:31:58,029
Thank you sir.

390
00:32:08,107 --> 00:32:09,867
You're wondering why
he was mute right?

391
00:32:10,126 --> 00:32:10,949
It's nothing.

392
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:13,942
It's the effect of what
you did to that HR.

393
00:32:14,247 --> 00:32:16,009
He's been silent ever since.

394
00:32:16,273 --> 00:32:18,289
He hasn't uttered a word.

395
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,196
Good morning everybody.

396
00:32:32,432 --> 00:32:35,019
I'm going to be your team leader..

397
00:32:38,445 --> 00:32:39,269
Good morning sir.

398
00:32:41,742 --> 00:32:42,503
God!

399
00:32:46,691 --> 00:32:47,429
What happened?

400
00:32:48,977 --> 00:32:51,417
He's my college senior, Selva.

401
00:32:52,925 --> 00:32:53,925
An insult!

402
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,324
My junior!

403
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:57,115
And she's..

404
00:32:58,251 --> 00:32:59,060
the team leader!

405
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:01,739
How can I..?

406
00:33:08,164 --> 00:33:09,508
He's a hothead.

407
00:33:10,023 --> 00:33:12,225
But he was everyone's
favourite senior.

408
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:13,671
Especially the girls'.

409
00:33:14,216 --> 00:33:16,932
But he can't face girls.

410
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:18,433
He's quite silent.

411
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,705
So much that you can
only hear him breathe.

412
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,684
You said it was your treat and
asked me to get here quickly.

413
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:27,721
But I don't have
any money with me.

414
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,509
You are my everything.

415
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:34,737
- Why did you not take this batch?
- I just can't.

416
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:36,047
I'll train another batch.

417
00:33:36,457 --> 00:33:37,306
No.

418
00:33:37,608 --> 00:33:38,290
No chance.

419
00:33:41,046 --> 00:33:41,768
Dear Lord

420
00:33:42,209 --> 00:33:43,682
I will face my enemies.

421
00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:46,009
Save me from friends like this.

422
00:33:46,364 --> 00:33:47,179
Save me.

423
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:52,948
Sudha

424
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,568
I do like her.

425
00:33:57,573 --> 00:34:00,152
No, no. I don't bro.

426
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:00,750
I don't.

427
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:03,370
Bro, I tell you now.

428
00:34:04,063 --> 00:34:06,769
I swear on this alcohol.

429
00:34:07,365 --> 00:34:08,994
I won't go that job again.

430
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:10,029
I won't.

431
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,404
I don't care even if I starve.

432
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:14,818
I won't go.

433
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:16,304
I won't.

434
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:17,727
I won't go.

435
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:18,743
Hey!

436
00:34:19,654 --> 00:34:20,866
Get me another drink!

437
00:34:21,586 --> 00:34:22,824
Today's fasting is done.

438
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:28,533
How come you're here?

439
00:34:29,523 --> 00:34:31,393
I thought you swore yesterday.

440
00:34:31,638 --> 00:34:33,276
That you would never
come back here.

441
00:34:33,993 --> 00:34:34,850
I was drunk.

442
00:34:35,586 --> 00:34:36,692
How do I eat today?

443
00:34:38,321 --> 00:34:39,321
I have a doubt.

444
00:34:39,864 --> 00:34:42,110
She changed her batch
because of him.

445
00:34:42,779 --> 00:34:44,375
And he is scared of her.

446
00:34:44,773 --> 00:34:45,773
What's going on?

447
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:51,132
Complete the training

448
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:52,653
and get to work.

449
00:35:00,593 --> 00:35:01,593
A good job.

450
00:35:02,335 --> 00:35:03,430
Umayal again.

451
00:35:04,494 --> 00:35:05,494
And friends.

452
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:07,609
My life was on a good note.

453
00:36:00,588 --> 00:36:01,588
Bro

454
00:36:02,018 --> 00:36:04,973
I don't think she's
right for you.

455
00:36:05,805 --> 00:36:06,634
She's just fine.

456
00:36:08,596 --> 00:36:09,795
It's not that.

457
00:36:09,995 --> 00:36:11,082
For your looks..

458
00:36:33,912 --> 00:36:34,965
He literally gets scared.

459
00:36:35,111 --> 00:36:36,111
It will come.

460
00:36:36,835 --> 00:36:38,217
Else we will get loan.

461
00:37:30,863 --> 00:37:31,323
Sir

462
00:37:32,033 --> 00:37:34,364
Someone is here with
Shanmuganathan to meet you.

463
00:37:34,459 --> 00:37:36,779
Do I ask them to come in?
- Yes.

464
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,558
He's a good friend.

465
00:37:39,702 --> 00:37:41,781
He's in the granite business.

466
00:37:42,445 --> 00:37:45,841
In order to apply a loan we met
Rajagopal sir at the bank.

467
00:37:46,435 --> 00:37:48,138
There's some problem
with the papers.

468
00:37:48,381 --> 00:37:50,679
He asked me to meet you.

469
00:37:51,597 --> 00:37:52,428
It's very simple.

470
00:37:53,683 --> 00:37:54,683
I'll get you the loan.

471
00:37:55,402 --> 00:37:57,964
My commission is 15%
from the total amount.

472
00:37:58,666 --> 00:37:59,444
plus

473
00:38:00,056 --> 00:38:02,097
The land you pledge,
will be mine.

474
00:38:02,807 --> 00:38:05,227
After you settle the
loan, it's your's.

475
00:38:05,642 --> 00:38:06,189
That's it.

476
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:09,351
If that's okay with you, I
can move for it tomorrow.

477
00:38:09,596 --> 00:38:10,795
The commission is a bit high.

478
00:38:11,193 --> 00:38:13,179
- Shut up.
- And we're pledging the land to the bank.

479
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,333
Shanmuganathan.

480
00:38:16,765 --> 00:38:18,558
You have 1000 rupees.

481
00:38:19,143 --> 00:38:21,745
All in coins. And when
you give it in a hotel..

482
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:23,906
you get a 100 rupee commission.

483
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:24,995
And for 1 lakh?

484
00:38:25,514 --> 00:38:26,536
10, 000 rupees.

485
00:38:27,194 --> 00:38:28,625
10% interest.

486
00:38:29,486 --> 00:38:32,010
- Which bank will give you?
- No one.

487
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,249
What Shanmuganathan?

488
00:38:33,994 --> 00:38:35,164
Retired bus conductor.

489
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,721
You're doing that business right?
- Yes.

490
00:38:38,398 --> 00:38:39,398
Tell him.

491
00:38:41,015 --> 00:38:42,015
How many holes?

492
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,943
Have we filled?

493
00:38:44,051 --> 00:38:47,119
- I'll talk later. - Sir, please..
- Shanmuganathan!

494
00:38:47,796 --> 00:38:49,756
- Sorry we'll come later.
- Thank you sir.

495
00:38:54,186 --> 00:38:56,011
Bro, shall we drink
brandy or whiskey?

496
00:38:56,036 --> 00:38:57,036
Damn!

497
00:38:59,110 --> 00:38:59,816
Madam.

498
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:01,667
He's calling you.

499
00:39:04,076 --> 00:39:06,489
No he's just kidding, you carry on.

500
00:39:07,463 --> 00:39:08,556
I'm sure he called you.

501
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:10,902
No, he's just kidding.
Hey!

502
00:39:10,927 --> 00:39:12,822
- He will call you.
- No, please go.

503
00:39:13,856 --> 00:39:15,323
You are totally unfit.

504
00:39:15,447 --> 00:39:18,099
A boy can have a thousand
reasons to like a girl.

505
00:39:18,765 --> 00:39:20,987
But I have only one reason.

506
00:39:21,404 --> 00:39:22,284
Her name.

507
00:39:23,126 --> 00:39:23,935
Umayal.

508
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:56,178
Hey Umayal..

509
00:39:56,308 --> 00:40:03,450
Don't let me go.
The sight of you kills my heart.

510
00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:07,855
Hey Umayal..

511
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:15,045
Don't let me go.
The sight of you kills my heart.

512
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:19,046
A sweet coincidence is all it took.

513
00:40:19,275 --> 00:40:22,168
Your lightning struck me.

514
00:40:22,193 --> 00:40:27,789
You make me suffer like
those dreaded rains.

515
00:40:28,148 --> 00:40:31,112
Hey Umayal..

516
00:40:31,258 --> 00:40:38,640
Don't let me go.
The sight of you kills my heart.

517
00:40:39,176 --> 00:40:42,747
Hey Umayal..

518
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:50,222
Don't let me go.
The sight of you kills my heart.

519
00:41:14,571 --> 00:41:17,111
My heart melts.
My days are dark.

520
00:41:17,136 --> 00:41:20,052
Even the scintillating
music sounds otherwise.

521
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:22,950
I've no track of time.
I've had no sleep.

522
00:41:22,975 --> 00:41:25,921
All this in just a short span.

523
00:41:25,946 --> 00:41:29,411
I walk yearning for your touch.

524
00:41:29,436 --> 00:41:32,358
What have you done to me?

525
00:41:32,383 --> 00:41:38,043
A pinch of love, a pinch of
silence, I'm dissolved in.

526
00:41:38,068 --> 00:41:41,025
Hey Umayal..

527
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:48,291
Don't let me go.
The sight of you kills my heart.

528
00:41:49,818 --> 00:41:52,604
Hey Umayal..

529
00:41:52,629 --> 00:42:00,200
Don't let me go.
The sight of you kills my heart.

530
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:21,966
Reddy Sir!

531
00:42:23,283 --> 00:42:24,757
Have you filed a police complaint?

532
00:42:26,974 --> 00:42:27,403
Good.

533
00:42:29,487 --> 00:42:31,231
I hear that the
evidence is strong.

534
00:42:35,927 --> 00:42:37,056
What did I ask for?

535
00:42:39,194 --> 00:42:39,773
No, no.

536
00:42:40,562 --> 00:42:41,743
What did you ask for?

537
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:44,811
For business,

538
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,700
a loan of 5 crore rupees.

539
00:42:48,548 --> 00:42:49,548
Did I get you that?

540
00:42:51,768 --> 00:42:53,862
Most of the documents
were improper.

541
00:42:54,654 --> 00:42:56,631
But I did it because the
property was genuine.

542
00:42:59,939 --> 00:43:00,820
Alright

543
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:02,874
You took the loan.

544
00:43:03,307 --> 00:43:04,307
Did you do business?

545
00:43:05,613 --> 00:43:06,811
That is..

546
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:08,229
You didn't

547
00:43:08,938 --> 00:43:09,422
Alright.

548
00:43:09,914 --> 00:43:11,649
That is your problem.

549
00:43:14,161 --> 00:43:15,719
When asked to return the loan..

550
00:43:16,022 --> 00:43:17,423
You said there was
a business loss.

551
00:43:18,108 --> 00:43:19,373
Even that is fine.

552
00:43:21,103 --> 00:43:22,103
Now, the bank

553
00:43:22,493 --> 00:43:23,493
has sent your file

554
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,461
to my agency.

555
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,663
We're only asking
for half the money.

556
00:43:28,974 --> 00:43:30,708
Use your property to settle it.

557
00:43:33,172 --> 00:43:35,692
In this normal process,

558
00:43:36,216 --> 00:43:38,845
Why did you involve the police?

559
00:43:44,871 --> 00:43:46,299
Police!

560
00:43:47,972 --> 00:43:49,073
Tell him.

561
00:43:50,482 --> 00:43:51,141
Reddy sir

562
00:43:52,433 --> 00:43:53,542
The police are your friend.

563
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,493
But you've misunderstood it.

564
00:43:57,584 --> 00:43:59,922
You gave this evidence at the
commissioner's office right?

565
00:44:00,324 --> 00:44:01,654
Make sure if it's the same.

566
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,630
We've managed to
get a hold of you.

567
00:44:05,025 --> 00:44:06,180
We have a network too.

568
00:44:06,473 --> 00:44:08,324
Why do you need this
unnecessary trouble?

569
00:44:09,329 --> 00:44:11,302
We know that you
had the evidence.

570
00:44:11,465 --> 00:44:13,657
And that you bought one of us.

571
00:44:14,887 --> 00:44:18,347
You even tried to sell
your property to someone.

572
00:44:22,849 --> 00:44:25,667
Keep your forward thinking aside
and just sign the papers.

573
00:44:40,027 --> 00:44:40,693
Sir

574
00:44:41,803 --> 00:44:42,830
I'm a bad guy.

575
00:44:43,553 --> 00:44:44,070
But

576
00:44:44,372 --> 00:44:45,737
I have my ethics.

577
00:44:48,327 --> 00:44:50,630
It has always
stimulated my growth.

578
00:44:51,249 --> 00:44:53,348
Everyone here knows that.

579
00:44:53,995 --> 00:44:54,995
They should.

580
00:44:55,987 --> 00:44:57,448
Those who don't..

581
00:45:08,215 --> 00:45:08,691
John!

582
00:45:12,422 --> 00:45:13,607
You gave him the footage?

583
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:18,915
Die!

584
00:45:24,794 --> 00:45:25,548
Water.

585
00:45:36,253 --> 00:45:37,062
Kill him.

586
00:45:41,651 --> 00:45:42,790
Why are you thinking?

587
00:45:43,489 --> 00:45:44,870
He may be your friend.

588
00:45:45,127 --> 00:45:46,127
He betrayed me.

589
00:45:46,549 --> 00:45:47,287
Kill him.

590
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:50,850
Kill him!

591
00:46:11,439 --> 00:46:12,777
- Shanmuganathan.
- Sir?

592
00:46:12,819 --> 00:46:13,819
Do you have change?

593
00:46:18,217 --> 00:46:19,087
No.

594
00:47:28,062 --> 00:47:30,490
Welcome to JustAsk.com
This is Selva.

595
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:31,515
How may I help you today?

596
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:33,445
Sir, Dileepan reporting
from Triplicane.

597
00:47:34,464 --> 00:47:35,565
Just one.
- Hello?

598
00:47:36,273 --> 00:47:37,273
Gun shoot, sir.

599
00:47:38,091 --> 00:47:42,050
Bike No. TN-22.. BA- 5173..
- Hello?

600
00:47:43,106 --> 00:47:44,604
5173, sir.

601
00:47:46,168 --> 00:47:48,607
As per my enquiry, the guy
isn't from this locality.

602
00:47:49,112 --> 00:47:51,420
Sir, public has already
called the ambulance.

603
00:47:52,676 --> 00:47:54,221
I'm following the ambulance.

604
00:47:54,366 --> 00:47:57,535
 TN-22.. BA- 5173..

605
00:47:58,089 --> 00:47:59,089
That's all, sir.

606
00:48:07,182 --> 00:48:08,390
Hello?

607
00:48:33,236 --> 00:48:34,236
Good morning!

608
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:38,938
Sir

609
00:48:39,434 --> 00:48:40,775
The cab is out of service.

610
00:48:41,832 --> 00:48:43,270
You have to take your own cab.

611
00:48:46,463 --> 00:48:47,304
Okay, bye.

612
00:49:23,265 --> 00:49:23,622
Hello?

613
00:49:25,176 --> 00:49:25,604
Where?

614
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:28,317
I can't hear you.

615
00:49:30,554 --> 00:49:31,370
Say it again.

616
00:49:33,235 --> 00:49:34,785
Triplicane Nagathamman
Temple street?

617
00:49:35,646 --> 00:49:36,646
Okay I'll come.

618
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:37,979
I'm on my way, wait.

619
00:49:39,414 --> 00:49:39,786
Hey

620
00:49:40,301 --> 00:49:41,707
I'm going to the same area.

621
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,097
There's no bus for
now, can you drop me?

622
00:49:44,122 --> 00:49:45,439
- Okay, sit.
- Thank you.

623
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:02,999
I'm going this side.

624
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:05,599
You?

625
00:50:06,028 --> 00:50:08,004
That's okay, my room is nearby.
Thank you.

626
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:40,749
Hey!

627
00:51:46,665 --> 00:51:47,363
Come on.

628
00:51:48,517 --> 00:51:49,932
- Come one.
- Quick.

629
00:51:50,189 --> 00:51:51,841
A traitor!

630
00:51:52,475 --> 00:51:54,360
Who is it?
- I don't know.

631
00:51:56,538 --> 00:51:58,345
Sir, Dileepan reporting
from Triplicane.

632
00:51:58,708 --> 00:51:59,494
Just one.

633
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:04,354
Bike No. TN-22.. BA- 5173..
I'm following the ambulance.

634
00:52:04,727 --> 00:52:07,563
TN-22.. BA- 5173..

635
00:52:08,108 --> 00:52:09,062
That's all, sir.

636
00:52:25,648 --> 00:52:27,967
Wake up!

637
00:52:29,092 --> 00:52:30,564
That's enough, wake up.

638
00:52:30,711 --> 00:52:32,433
Are you gonna wake up or not?

639
00:52:32,577 --> 00:52:34,502
Wake up!

640
00:52:45,846 --> 00:52:47,538
Am I stupid or what?

641
00:54:20,082 --> 00:54:21,786
Dude, overtake him.

642
00:54:21,847 --> 00:54:23,720
Don't let him go.

643
00:54:23,925 --> 00:54:25,708
He's nothing, corner him.

644
00:54:26,274 --> 00:54:28,718
Catch up to him.

645
00:54:38,589 --> 00:54:40,219
Catch up.

646
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,347
Overtake him!

647
00:54:45,279 --> 00:54:47,712
Sasi.
Slow down.

648
00:54:48,555 --> 00:54:50,266
Let's see if he goes away.

649
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,148
Be normal, Sasi.

650
00:55:35,578 --> 00:55:37,202
Sasi, hit the brakes and
pull over to the left.

651
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:01,684
Hey, wait!

652
00:56:03,672 --> 00:56:04,848
Who are you?

653
00:56:20,666 --> 00:56:22,042
Why can't he let go of it?

654
00:57:03,431 --> 00:57:06,024
In big libraries to
protect precious books

655
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:07,826
from theft,

656
00:57:08,053 --> 00:57:11,619
they use white phosphorous
on it for safety.

657
00:57:12,613 --> 00:57:14,850
In case of any mishap,

658
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:16,817
the moisture in
phosphorous reduces.

659
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:20,232
So it either catches
fire or emits smoke.

660
00:57:20,617 --> 00:57:21,720
That's the reason Selva.

661
00:57:22,618 --> 00:57:24,737
Given the incidents
you've encountered,

662
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:27,232
I have two conclusions.

663
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:28,423
One

664
00:57:29,822 --> 00:57:31,339
It could be your imagination.

665
00:57:32,746 --> 00:57:34,320
We call it an illusion.

666
00:57:36,226 --> 00:57:37,100
Two

667
00:57:38,907 --> 00:57:42,619
It could be the work of a
soul that is related to you.

668
00:57:44,536 --> 00:57:45,895
It must be a lovable soul.

669
00:57:49,634 --> 00:57:50,634
Sir, maybe this is

670
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:53,364
a ghost?

671
00:57:54,862 --> 00:57:55,430
A ghost?

672
00:57:56,189 --> 00:57:57,972
We call it

673
00:57:59,554 --> 00:58:01,387
"The travel of a soul
without a vessel."

674
00:58:02,448 --> 00:58:06,663
Selva, we are alive and we're
interacting with each other.

675
00:58:07,126 --> 00:58:08,126
Just like this

676
00:58:08,497 --> 00:58:09,683
those without a body

677
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:11,350
have a purpose.

678
00:58:14,315 --> 00:58:16,481
But at midnight, exactly at 12:15

679
00:58:17,626 --> 00:58:19,049
for 29 seconds

680
00:58:20,153 --> 00:58:22,926
this book provides you
everything you need.

681
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:24,603
So

682
00:58:25,563 --> 00:58:28,328
There's something that is in sync
with your brain's wavelengths

683
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,140
in this book.

684
00:58:32,225 --> 00:58:33,642
Listen carefully.

685
00:58:33,871 --> 00:58:35,456
Repeat my words.

686
00:58:35,864 --> 00:58:37,064
Seven.
- Seven..

687
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,683
Sir.. Bike No. TN-22..
BA- 5173..

688
00:58:42,237 --> 00:58:43,237
5173, sir.

689
00:58:46,015 --> 00:58:47,619
I'm not scared of this.

690
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,661
In fact, it has helped me.

691
00:58:50,574 --> 00:58:51,988
It isn't normal.

692
00:58:52,282 --> 00:58:53,282
Just a doubt.

693
00:58:53,693 --> 00:58:55,298
I wanted to know the reason.

694
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:57,127
If you need an exact definition,

695
00:58:59,153 --> 00:59:01,673
this is something that has a
strong connection to you.

696
00:59:05,977 --> 00:59:07,021
According to me

697
00:59:08,246 --> 00:59:09,182
this is a book.

698
00:59:10,518 --> 00:59:11,614
Bundle of papers.

699
00:59:12,933 --> 00:59:13,480
That's all.

700
00:59:14,126 --> 00:59:15,581
How could this call
me through the phone?

701
00:59:16,903 --> 00:59:18,826
I just don't get it.

702
00:59:21,452 --> 00:59:24,086
The elements of nature
has an unspoken power.

703
00:59:25,102 --> 00:59:28,654
These souls use a
medium to function.

704
00:59:28,844 --> 00:59:31,116
Like water, land,
fire and air.

705
00:59:31,873 --> 00:59:36,815
Good or bad. These 29 seconds
are your greatest gift.

706
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:12,274
Someone dies every hour.

707
01:00:13,339 --> 01:00:15,176
Next will be either of you.

708
01:00:17,995 --> 01:00:21,541
We should decide our
enemy and our death.

709
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,260
Only then we can survive.

710
01:00:38,709 --> 01:00:40,161
That day suddenly, Umayal..

711
01:00:40,316 --> 01:00:41,947
wanted to meet all of us.

712
01:00:42,116 --> 01:00:42,949
What is it?

713
01:00:44,115 --> 01:00:47,326
I had taken a personal
loan 4 months back.

714
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,051
When taking my
signatures in the form,

715
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:52,605
they deceived me and kept some
credit card papers inside.

716
01:00:52,662 --> 01:00:55,630
They took a card in my name
and used 1.5 lakhs.

717
01:00:57,509 --> 01:00:58,760
When I asked the bank

718
01:00:59,029 --> 01:01:00,620
they said he quit his job.

719
01:01:00,951 --> 01:01:02,691
And now, a private agency

720
01:01:02,995 --> 01:01:05,844
has been calling me for the
credit card payment for 10 days.

721
01:01:06,097 --> 01:01:10,825
I went to ask permission
to make EMI payments.

722
01:01:11,047 --> 01:01:12,899
I can understand
your problem Umayal.

723
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:14,640
What's your full name?

724
01:01:15,015 --> 01:01:15,760
Umayal Nandhini

725
01:01:16,029 --> 01:01:16,520
Nandhini?

726
01:01:16,886 --> 01:01:17,290
Good.

727
01:01:18,351 --> 01:01:20,000
Umayal is very hard to use.

728
01:01:20,909 --> 01:01:22,083
I just took your case.

729
01:01:22,734 --> 01:01:23,734
I'll talk to the bank.

730
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:25,986
- Okay, thank you.
- Anyway

731
01:01:27,209 --> 01:01:28,994
- Nice meeting you.
- Thank you sir.

732
01:01:29,782 --> 01:01:31,218
2 days later

733
01:01:31,586 --> 01:01:32,586
He came to visit me.

734
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:34,123
Nandhini, I spoke to the bank.

735
01:01:34,605 --> 01:01:36,038
You can return it when you can.

736
01:01:36,512 --> 01:01:37,579
Your comfortable date and time.

737
01:01:39,103 --> 01:01:40,103
Thanks sir, but

738
01:01:40,522 --> 01:01:41,522
the amount is ready.

739
01:01:41,825 --> 01:01:42,825
I'll give it tomorrow.

740
01:01:43,083 --> 01:01:44,083
Oh, good.

741
01:01:46,391 --> 01:01:48,534
Nandhini, Can I ask
you something?

742
01:01:49,449 --> 01:01:52,798
Sorry sir, but I'm already committed.
Please.

743
01:01:56,552 --> 01:02:00,713
Despite that he keeps calling
and sending messages.

744
01:02:01,098 --> 01:02:04,525
I have my UPSC exam next week in Bangalore.
It's been my life's ambition.

745
01:02:05,786 --> 01:02:08,354
With his trouble, I'm not
able to concentrate.

746
01:02:09,133 --> 01:02:10,672
I could have gone to the police.

747
01:02:11,153 --> 01:02:12,359
But I don't have the courage.

748
01:02:12,876 --> 01:02:15,005
I couldn't hide it
from you guys anymore.

749
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:16,482
That's why..

750
01:02:18,629 --> 01:02:19,534
Give me his number.

751
01:04:00,916 --> 01:04:03,228
Come on..
Start the car.

752
01:04:11,672 --> 01:04:12,611
Who is it?!

753
01:05:28,106 --> 01:05:29,391
Holiday tomorrow?

754
01:05:29,772 --> 01:05:30,256
Sir?

755
01:05:31,226 --> 01:05:32,919
7 days before they
tried to kill me.

756
01:05:33,776 --> 01:05:34,260
Now

757
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:36,086
They've killed my brother.

758
01:05:36,246 --> 01:05:37,362
It could be you next.

759
01:05:39,387 --> 01:05:40,878
Someone's messing with us.

760
01:05:42,127 --> 01:05:43,576
If it was 1 or 2 we
could investigate.

761
01:05:43,772 --> 01:05:45,699
We're handling 30-40 cases.

762
01:05:46,044 --> 01:05:48,652
We have no clue who
the enemy could be.

763
01:05:49,969 --> 01:05:50,373
John.

764
01:05:51,351 --> 01:05:52,834
Reddy was our last case.

765
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:54,282
Maybe it was him?

766
01:05:54,515 --> 01:05:57,530
I traced 30 numbers in
Solomon's call history.

767
01:05:57,761 --> 01:05:59,597
4 of those numbers are
still not reachable.

768
01:05:59,923 --> 01:06:02,305
I've been able to
communicate with the rest.

769
01:06:02,838 --> 01:06:06,260
The footage from the camera we put up
in the car after the accident is here.

770
01:06:07,177 --> 01:06:09,620
Let's see if we get
something from it.

771
01:06:10,382 --> 01:06:10,929
Sir.

772
01:06:12,868 --> 01:06:14,826
After verifying the footage

773
01:06:14,895 --> 01:06:18,044
it is clear that for the past 2-3
days 2 characters are recurring.

774
01:06:18,328 --> 01:06:19,328
A white Omni van

775
01:06:19,399 --> 01:06:20,677
registration number

776
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:23,043
TN-23-2235

777
01:06:24,301 --> 01:06:25,904
And an Enfield Bullet

778
01:06:26,493 --> 01:06:28,161
TSA 5559

779
01:06:28,596 --> 01:06:30,799
But face recognition
was not possible.

780
01:06:32,018 --> 01:06:35,240
But this has been
planned and executed.

781
01:06:42,814 --> 01:06:44,157
The fear is gone!

782
01:06:44,336 --> 01:06:45,571
For us.

783
01:06:46,323 --> 01:06:48,687
Everything was fine
until we had fear.

784
01:06:49,548 --> 01:06:51,720
We have intensely
messed up someone.

785
01:06:54,972 --> 01:06:56,089
Kill everyone.

786
01:06:56,955 --> 01:06:57,968
Whoever you get,

787
01:06:58,690 --> 01:06:59,673
kill them slowly

788
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:01,506
and savour it.

789
01:07:04,092 --> 01:07:05,816
Only then whoever did it

790
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,428
will reveal himself.

791
01:07:39,318 --> 01:07:40,714
Why did they bring you here?

792
01:07:43,552 --> 01:07:45,235
Someone killed his brother.

793
01:07:46,458 --> 01:07:47,690
Damn womaniser!

794
01:07:48,627 --> 01:07:50,003
On suspicion

795
01:07:50,439 --> 01:07:51,439
I've been brought here.

796
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:53,197
I killed his brother.

797
01:07:56,652 --> 01:07:58,183
I'm from Tirunelveli.

798
01:07:58,954 --> 01:08:01,312
My father, mom and my sister.

799
01:08:02,075 --> 01:08:03,075
We were a beautiful family.

800
01:08:04,207 --> 01:08:05,726
I was a cab driver in Chennai.

801
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:09,285
My sister was doing
her 12th grade.

802
01:08:09,657 --> 01:08:10,987
She wanted to study in Chennai.

803
01:08:11,392 --> 01:08:12,791
We got a seat through
counselling.

804
01:08:13,207 --> 01:08:14,341
Some bio-medical.

805
01:08:14,703 --> 01:08:15,703
First year

806
01:08:16,095 --> 01:08:17,907
we somehow managed
to pay the fees.

807
01:08:19,135 --> 01:08:20,252
But not the 2nd year.

808
01:08:21,224 --> 01:08:23,563
With some help from close friends

809
01:08:24,291 --> 01:08:25,291
I took a loan.

810
01:08:25,788 --> 01:08:29,309
The bank told me we could settle
it after she finished the course.

811
01:08:29,661 --> 01:08:31,445
She said she would pay it herself.

812
01:08:32,249 --> 01:08:34,815
I was very proud of my sister.

813
01:08:37,041 --> 01:08:38,395
Everything was fine.

814
01:08:39,848 --> 01:08:40,848
Suddenly one day

815
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,267
I was notified from her hostel

816
01:08:44,499 --> 01:08:47,040
that she had committed suicide.

817
01:08:54,129 --> 01:08:56,661
We were devastated.

818
01:08:56,820 --> 01:08:58,686
We were devastated.

819
01:09:01,336 --> 01:09:04,119
My sister is not a coward
who commits suicide.

820
01:09:06,883 --> 01:09:08,072
I investigated it.

821
01:09:08,896 --> 01:09:10,542
That damn bastard.

822
01:09:11,403 --> 01:09:12,403
The one I burnt.

823
01:09:13,078 --> 01:09:13,697
Him.

824
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:16,547
He met her regarding the
loan several times.

825
01:09:17,638 --> 01:09:21,632
He seduced her and
spoiled her life.

826
01:09:25,221 --> 01:09:27,028
With these rich people

827
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:29,181
justice isn't an option.

828
01:09:29,697 --> 01:09:31,493
That's why I decided to
kill them separately.

829
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:32,691
In the highway

830
01:09:32,897 --> 01:09:33,836
I had it all planned out.

831
01:09:34,214 --> 01:09:35,338
Had he died that day,

832
01:09:35,952 --> 01:09:38,736
I would have paid a fine for
brake failure and got away.

833
01:09:39,533 --> 01:09:40,938
The bastard, he escaped.

834
01:09:42,876 --> 01:09:45,381
Then his brother
was caught alone.

835
01:09:46,209 --> 01:09:47,476
I burnt him.

836
01:09:47,556 --> 01:09:49,538
He was burnt to death.

837
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:53,306
It felt so good.

838
01:09:56,394 --> 01:09:58,251
They found out somehow
and caught me.

839
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:00,816
We must escape from here.

840
01:10:09,462 --> 01:10:11,309
First let's figure out
how to untie ourselves.

841
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:49,464
Wish you merry Christmas.

842
01:11:53,115 --> 01:11:55,048
God bless you my child.

843
01:11:55,172 --> 01:11:58,798
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way.

844
01:11:58,893 --> 01:12:01,084
Wish you merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

845
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:03,459
Jingle all the way.

846
01:12:09,598 --> 01:12:10,026
Hello

847
01:12:12,678 --> 01:12:13,575
Hello?

848
01:12:19,225 --> 01:12:20,089
Hello

849
01:12:24,332 --> 01:12:25,070
Hello?

850
01:12:36,735 --> 01:12:37,393
What happened?

851
01:12:39,839 --> 01:12:40,363
Hello

852
01:12:42,852 --> 01:12:43,288
Hello?

853
01:12:59,506 --> 01:13:00,506
What happened John?

854
01:13:34,664 --> 01:13:37,477
Hello.
- Aadhi, this is Selva.

855
01:13:37,566 --> 01:13:38,566
Where are you?

856
01:13:38,709 --> 01:13:40,171
Your number is not
reachable since yesterday.

857
01:13:40,359 --> 01:13:41,955
None knows about
your whereabouts.

858
01:13:42,034 --> 01:13:43,710
Don't ask me any questios now.

859
01:13:43,741 --> 01:13:45,013
Just listen to me.

860
01:13:45,172 --> 01:13:47,371
I had an old diary
resembling a book.

861
01:13:48,204 --> 01:13:51,184
Can you look in to it, please?

862
01:13:54,056 --> 01:13:56,845
Hello. - Where are you?
- On the way to hostel.

863
01:13:56,904 --> 01:13:58,727
Pack everything and be ready.

864
01:13:58,873 --> 01:14:02,271
A small surprise.
I'm on the way. - Okay.

865
01:14:05,156 --> 01:14:07,313
Hello.
- Jenni, this is Selva.

866
01:14:07,865 --> 01:14:10,794
Don't leave the office
till I ask you to leave. Okay?

867
01:14:11,536 --> 01:14:13,355
Don't leave the office
till I ask you. - Okay..

868
01:14:14,526 --> 01:14:18,062
One tea.- In the case of ISBC
Bank's Industrial credit..

869
01:14:18,393 --> 01:14:21,125
..It's manger, Mr. Rajagopal
was arrested in the noon

870
01:14:21,171 --> 01:14:24,532
by Central
Anti-Corruption Bureau.

871
01:14:24,826 --> 01:14:28,001
He has been alleged for
misusing the unpaid loan...

872
01:14:28,234 --> 01:14:30,865
by hacking the software
since 6 months

873
01:14:30,946 --> 01:14:35,193
and mishandling about
10 crores Rupees.

874
01:14:36,492 --> 01:14:39,827
In this same case..
- No money.. Cancel the order.

875
01:14:40,452 --> 01:14:42,076
It's okay.
Have it.

876
01:14:42,125 --> 01:14:43,784
Police are refraining
to clarify.

877
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:48,832
Since the bank is
not giving any...- Thanks.

878
01:15:02,556 --> 01:15:04,485
Who is this?
Hello!

879
01:15:04,591 --> 01:15:06,431
Hello, Sudha..
- Hello...

880
01:15:06,472 --> 01:15:07,441
Tell me, dude.
- Hello..

881
01:15:07,777 --> 01:15:09,301
Sudha, this is Selva.

882
01:15:09,711 --> 01:15:13,649
Hello.. - CM has come for an inauguration.
I'm unable to catch your voice.

883
01:15:13,952 --> 01:15:15,512
I will call you once
it's done. - Hey!

884
01:15:15,567 --> 01:15:17,359
Sudha, can you hear me?

885
01:15:17,938 --> 01:15:21,534
Yes, dude. - This is Selva. I need
your bike and debit card.

886
01:15:21,770 --> 01:15:23,129
Come, get it.

887
01:15:49,869 --> 01:15:51,949
- Check if everyone has their phone.
- Okay, sir.

888
01:16:15,867 --> 01:16:17,557
- Did you get everyone's phone?
- Yes.

889
01:16:17,759 --> 01:16:18,800
One phone is missing.

890
01:16:19,347 --> 01:16:21,013
- Whose?
- The blue shirt.

891
01:16:34,496 --> 01:16:36,256
Hello.
- Hello.

892
01:16:36,678 --> 01:16:38,647
- Hello.
- Tell me, John.

893
01:16:38,822 --> 01:16:42,040
Are you feeling great
that you escaped?

894
01:16:43,695 --> 01:16:45,289
What do you think?

895
01:16:45,464 --> 01:16:46,464
Heroism?

896
01:16:47,732 --> 01:16:50,641
I'm not sure if you are
connected to this or not.

897
01:16:51,042 --> 01:16:54,682
You killed my men, didn't you?
I will avenge you.

898
01:16:55,658 --> 01:16:57,390
It will be a brutal death.

899
01:16:57,415 --> 01:16:58,921
Hey!!

900
01:16:59,827 --> 01:17:03,001
You are no God to
decide my death.

901
01:17:03,551 --> 01:17:06,775
I'm not the person to die
to clarify your doubt.

902
01:17:07,191 --> 01:17:09,007
I’m not sure whether it's
a long lasting feud.

903
01:17:09,803 --> 01:17:11,910
But I'm getting furious
listening to you.

904
01:17:12,944 --> 01:17:15,590
Yes, I'm feeling the same way.

905
01:17:16,555 --> 01:17:19,870
Your voice is
getting me enraged.

906
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:24,366
You should not dictate the terms.
I will.

907
01:17:25,126 --> 01:17:28,650
The moment I see you
will be your last moment.

908
01:17:30,523 --> 01:17:33,701
No matter where you are.
You will be dead before dawn.

909
01:17:33,726 --> 01:17:35,347
- Let's see.
- Let's see.

910
01:19:00,511 --> 01:19:02,161
He has to pass this route
to reach his room.

911
01:19:02,748 --> 01:19:03,613
Today is his end.

912
01:19:08,331 --> 01:19:10,150
Come soon.

913
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:11,560
We have reached.

914
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:39,109
Yes it's him.

915
01:19:39,186 --> 01:19:40,494
Wait!
Our boys are on the way.

916
01:19:46,496 --> 01:19:47,496
Give me a water bottle.

917
01:20:18,981 --> 01:20:21,560
He is running away.
He must die this time.

918
01:20:27,315 --> 01:20:28,848
If I get to catch you..

919
01:20:43,459 --> 01:20:44,682
- Come on..
- Catch him.

920
01:20:45,102 --> 01:20:47,099
- Don't let him escape.
- Kill him.

921
01:20:47,165 --> 01:20:48,165
Move..

922
01:21:11,415 --> 01:21:13,994
- Hello.
- I got the book.

923
01:21:15,001 --> 01:21:16,539
Hello..

924
01:21:21,841 --> 01:21:23,219
- You moron.
- Selva!

925
01:21:23,567 --> 01:21:25,378
- Are you on the line?
- You are caught.

926
01:21:25,535 --> 01:21:26,866
Did you think of escaping?

927
01:21:27,095 --> 01:21:28,674
You are trapped.

928
01:21:29,007 --> 01:21:30,237
You are dead.

929
01:21:30,854 --> 01:21:31,854
Dude, call him.

930
01:21:39,917 --> 01:21:41,970
What is he doing here?

931
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:47,866
- Hello.
- Sir.

932
01:21:49,327 --> 01:21:50,327
He is caught.

933
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:54,934
Give me 10 minutes.

934
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:57,256
I will bring his head.

935
01:21:57,455 --> 01:21:58,898
He must not escape at any cost.

936
01:21:59,147 --> 01:22:01,695
He can't escape.

937
01:22:02,136 --> 01:22:03,136
You come here.

938
01:22:05,173 --> 01:22:06,173
Move faster.

939
01:22:13,591 --> 01:22:15,166
- Move aside.
- Get lost.

940
01:22:18,315 --> 01:22:20,144
Hey, you..

941
01:22:20,889 --> 01:22:25,674
What are you doing at this hour?
That too with these guys?

942
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:27,358
Park the vehicle aside.

943
01:22:28,301 --> 01:22:31,182
- What happened?
- Park the vehicle aside.

944
01:22:35,421 --> 01:22:36,421
Tell me.

945
01:22:38,689 --> 01:22:41,062
Abuse them badly.

946
01:22:43,764 --> 01:22:45,800
Let's settle the
dispute amicably.

947
01:22:45,825 --> 01:22:47,579
- Why abuse?
- Start.

948
01:22:49,761 --> 01:22:51,682
- I mean...
- Abuse..

949
01:22:55,466 --> 01:22:58,038
- Okay, let me deal.
- Okay.

950
01:22:59,290 --> 01:23:00,451
Please forgive me, Jesus.

951
01:23:01,114 --> 01:23:03,612
You moron.

952
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:04,937
Senseless idiots.

953
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:07,738
Dare to touch him.

954
01:23:08,987 --> 01:23:10,471
Is it okay, dude?

955
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:13,878
- Why aren't you saying anything?
- Hey, fatso.

956
01:23:13,903 --> 01:23:17,299
- Don't move.
- Did he get me into trouble?

957
01:23:18,349 --> 01:23:21,189
- Come soon.
- I'm dead.

958
01:23:29,942 --> 01:23:32,514
All towns are one.

959
01:23:32,648 --> 01:23:34,860
All men our kin.

960
01:23:34,958 --> 01:23:38,436
Man's pains and pain's
relief are from within.

961
01:23:41,354 --> 01:23:45,688
Death's no new thing...

962
01:23:46,235 --> 01:23:50,020
nor do our blossoms thrill.

963
01:23:52,656 --> 01:23:56,239
When joyous life seems
like a luscious drought...

964
01:23:56,271 --> 01:23:59,560
When grieved, we patient
suffer; for, we deem.

965
01:23:59,605 --> 01:24:04,286
Tho' storms with lightning's
flash from darkened skies...

966
01:24:04,899 --> 01:24:07,644
Borne down the waters of
some mountain stream...

967
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:10,534
That o'er huge boulders
roaring seeks the plain.

968
01:24:10,626 --> 01:24:13,478
Borne down the waters of
some mountain stream...

969
01:24:13,484 --> 01:24:16,394
That o'er huge boulders
roaring seeks the plain..

970
01:24:16,459 --> 01:24:19,136
Descend, the raft goes
on as fates ordain.

971
01:24:19,206 --> 01:24:22,019
Thus have we seen in
visions of the wise!

972
01:25:07,449 --> 01:25:13,232
We marvel not at the
greatness of the great...

973
01:25:19,159 --> 01:25:24,691
Still less despise we
men of low estate.

974
01:25:29,971 --> 01:25:33,243
All towns are one.
All men our kin.

975
01:25:33,437 --> 01:25:36,692
Man's pains and pain's
relief are from within.

976
01:25:36,794 --> 01:25:38,903
Death's no new thing...

977
01:25:38,989 --> 01:25:41,710
nor do our blossoms thrill.

978
01:25:59,173 --> 01:26:01,849
Borne down the waters of
some mountain stream..

979
01:26:01,978 --> 01:26:04,891
that o'er huge boulders
roaring seeks the plain.

980
01:26:04,935 --> 01:26:07,649
Borne down the waters of
some mountain stream..

981
01:26:07,782 --> 01:26:10,836
that o'er huge boulders
roaring seeks the plain.

982
01:26:10,881 --> 01:26:13,403
Descend, the raft goes
on as fates ordain

983
01:26:13,588 --> 01:26:16,559
Thus have we seen in
visions of the wise!

984
01:26:18,551 --> 01:26:19,962
All towns are one.

985
01:26:22,728 --> 01:26:26,072
All men our kin.

986
01:26:27,770 --> 01:26:32,506
'Man's pains and pain's relief are
from within.'

987
01:26:54,901 --> 01:26:58,792
Go to hell.
Hang the phone.

988
01:27:01,697 --> 01:27:02,697
I will deal it myself.

989
01:27:18,791 --> 01:27:20,096
Did you track his number, Sasi?

990
01:27:20,241 --> 01:27:22,295
John, he is traveling
in the same path as you.

991
01:27:22,465 --> 01:27:23,799
He is on the Mount road area.

992
01:27:24,406 --> 01:27:26,136
We can catch him nearby.

993
01:27:26,684 --> 01:27:28,332
Can we catch him
there for sure? - No..

994
01:27:28,523 --> 01:27:29,740
We will definitely get a spot.

995
01:27:29,848 --> 01:27:30,848
We can plan it over there.

996
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:32,969
When are you coming?
- John, you keep moving.

997
01:27:33,017 --> 01:27:35,130
I'll track his number and
I will catch you later.

998
01:27:47,093 --> 01:27:49,688
Based on the incidents that
are happening around me..

999
01:27:50,478 --> 01:27:52,377
One thing is clear.

1000
01:27:53,039 --> 01:27:54,460
Something is unsettled.

1001
01:27:54,707 --> 01:27:56,798
Ancestors.. Past life..

1002
01:27:57,691 --> 01:27:59,499
Does it have any such connections?

1003
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:00,858
May be.

1004
01:28:01,072 --> 01:28:02,382
May be you are the one.

1005
01:28:06,906 --> 01:28:08,812
Some incident.

1006
01:28:08,837 --> 01:28:10,919
Based on this incident...

1007
01:28:11,226 --> 01:28:12,226
This incident and..

1008
01:28:13,130 --> 01:28:15,911
1400 gms of brain

1009
01:28:16,595 --> 01:28:17,582
have a close connection.

1010
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:19,360
So..

1011
01:28:20,079 --> 01:28:22,753
This book has the
power of traveling

1012
01:28:22,836 --> 01:28:24,376
with your thoughts.

1013
01:28:28,703 --> 01:28:30,384
Once the heart beat stops..

1014
01:28:31,151 --> 01:28:32,606
time taken by blood to..

1015
01:28:33,294 --> 01:28:34,872
coagulate is..

1016
01:28:36,642 --> 01:28:37,642
29 seconds.

1017
01:28:42,201 --> 01:28:44,068
It's an interesting connectivity.

1018
01:29:18,289 --> 01:29:19,786
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings.

1019
01:29:21,754 --> 01:29:23,438
Sir.
- Pass it.

1020
01:29:31,125 --> 01:29:32,125
Next..

1021
01:29:40,447 --> 01:29:43,770
Next.. - You got a letter
from the company.

1022
01:29:43,983 --> 01:29:45,583
So, I hurried down here.

1023
01:29:51,466 --> 01:29:52,950
Hey, come here.
- Sir.

1024
01:29:54,528 --> 01:29:56,273
- Lord Robert is coming.
- Okay, sir.

1025
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:57,745
I guess he is coming to rest.

1026
01:29:58,256 --> 01:29:59,831
Take the key and
clean the bungalow.

1027
01:30:00,059 --> 01:30:01,647
- Definitely.
- Hey.

1028
01:30:01,983 --> 01:30:03,945
Sir. - Take one more
fellow with you.- Okay.

1029
01:30:06,412 --> 01:30:07,684
Why are you
scratching your head?

1030
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:09,519
My younger daughter
has attained puberty.

1031
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:11,534
If you can get me
a loan of Rs.50..

1032
01:30:11,725 --> 01:30:12,929
I'll pay it back in 6 months.

1033
01:30:14,133 --> 01:30:16,120
Meet me tomorrow.
I have things to work.

1034
01:30:16,145 --> 01:30:17,833
You can leave.
Next..

1035
01:30:20,293 --> 01:30:21,456
It's company's money.

1036
01:30:21,504 --> 01:30:23,971
Why is he refraining
as if it's his.

1037
01:30:35,210 --> 01:30:36,477
Greetings, my Lord.

1038
01:30:36,917 --> 01:30:39,480
Stop there.- Run..
Play somewhere else.

1039
01:30:58,742 --> 01:31:00,600
Welcome..

1040
01:31:17,909 --> 01:31:19,377
- Then, Kangaani.
- Yes.

1041
01:31:19,402 --> 01:31:21,069
I need to go for hunting.

1042
01:31:21,724 --> 01:31:23,773
- Make the arrangements.
- Yes.. I will.

1043
01:31:24,405 --> 01:31:27,275
I need a guide who knows
the forest well.

1044
01:31:28,258 --> 01:31:31,810
A servant. And most
importantly, a translator.

1045
01:31:31,835 --> 01:31:32,835
Okay, sir.

1046
01:31:33,204 --> 01:31:35,892
Make the arrangements.
Be fast.

1047
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:40,453
Bring it fast.

1048
01:31:41,348 --> 01:31:42,392
Greetings.

1049
01:31:42,775 --> 01:31:44,236
Why are you worried?

1050
01:31:44,838 --> 01:31:47,211
He wants a translator.

1051
01:31:47,426 --> 01:31:48,712
I'm a bit confused.

1052
01:31:49,246 --> 01:31:50,606
The one who visits the bungalow.

1053
01:31:50,706 --> 01:31:52,604
His name is Chezhiyan.

1054
01:31:52,933 --> 01:31:54,400
He is tough to manage.

1055
01:31:55,237 --> 01:31:56,780
Kumarasamy's son, Krishnan.

1056
01:31:57,119 --> 01:31:58,547
They are thick friends.

1057
01:31:58,798 --> 01:32:00,757
He will never say no to him.

1058
01:32:02,477 --> 01:32:04,436
Krishnan or Chezhiyan?

1059
01:32:04,461 --> 01:32:05,760
I'm not sure.

1060
01:32:06,276 --> 01:32:08,454
I'm confused.
The 50 Rs. I asked for?

1061
01:33:10,711 --> 01:33:13,072
Mom, I'm hungry.

1062
01:33:13,352 --> 01:33:14,318
Can I get some food?

1063
01:33:14,343 --> 01:33:16,438
As if you are getting
late for the job.

1064
01:33:16,463 --> 01:33:19,558
Can't you pluck the leaves in
the estate instead being idle?

1065
01:33:20,812 --> 01:33:23,611
It's better to stay
here than doing that.

1066
01:33:23,996 --> 01:33:25,321
Do want me to die sick?

1067
01:33:25,622 --> 01:33:28,060
We grew up in this forest.

1068
01:33:28,336 --> 01:33:30,105
Now it belongs to them.

1069
01:33:30,241 --> 01:33:32,534
Stop quoting.
Look at our condition.

1070
01:33:32,685 --> 01:33:35,033
Your father has joined
the freedom movement.

1071
01:33:35,215 --> 01:33:37,159
But you are just gaining weight.
Nothing else.

1072
01:33:37,518 --> 01:33:38,877
They are destroying the forest.

1073
01:33:39,205 --> 01:33:40,600
I'm not getting involved in it.

1074
01:33:40,923 --> 01:33:43,568
I grew up eating
the natural food.

1075
01:33:44,201 --> 01:33:47,158
Do you want to me to
suffer eating free bread?

1076
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:49,605
I can't take medicine.

1077
01:33:50,427 --> 01:33:51,490
Food is medicine.

1078
01:33:51,746 --> 01:33:54,281
Healthy body is a sound body.

1079
01:33:54,799 --> 01:33:56,566
You have good oratory skill.

1080
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:59,711
Do I?
Then give me 2 annas.

1081
01:34:01,234 --> 01:34:02,234
Mom!

1082
01:34:04,645 --> 01:34:06,895
Kangaani is calling.

1083
01:34:07,677 --> 01:34:08,677
What?

1084
01:34:09,431 --> 01:34:10,431
Why is he calling me?

1085
01:34:11,621 --> 01:34:13,231
Might be to get his money back.

1086
01:34:16,978 --> 01:34:17,978
Come, Nair.

1087
01:34:18,708 --> 01:34:20,834
Is your dad, good?
- He is okay.

1088
01:34:21,292 --> 01:34:23,629
The estate's inventory is
unchecked because of his absence.

1089
01:34:23,654 --> 01:34:25,153
He will resume his
work in 2 days.

1090
01:34:25,616 --> 01:34:27,247
The reason I called you is..
- Sir..

1091
01:34:27,962 --> 01:34:29,495
Lord Robert has
come from Madras.

1092
01:34:33,610 --> 01:34:34,744
He wants to go for hunting.

1093
01:34:35,293 --> 01:34:38,354
Only you and Vidudhalai have a
good knowledge about forest.

1094
01:34:40,538 --> 01:34:43,459
Chezhiyan will come
only if you request.

1095
01:34:44,989 --> 01:34:46,956
He is a bit unpredictable.

1096
01:34:46,981 --> 01:34:47,981
Take care.

1097
01:34:49,154 --> 01:34:50,154
Okay, sir.

1098
01:34:51,013 --> 01:34:54,632
If you can send me to the
Kozhikode Tea estate auction

1099
01:34:54,657 --> 01:34:56,906
I'll learn the business tricks.

1100
01:34:57,250 --> 01:34:58,797
I will get some contacts.

1101
01:34:59,416 --> 01:35:02,164
My family can't survive
on dad's income alone.

1102
01:35:02,406 --> 01:35:04,539
I gave a little prideful speech.
But I'm feeling hungry.

1103
01:35:05,924 --> 01:35:07,328
Can't you come soon?

1104
01:35:09,023 --> 01:35:11,046
For which Congress movement is
your father gathering people?

1105
01:35:11,434 --> 01:35:12,930
He will be thrashed to death.

1106
01:35:13,349 --> 01:35:15,666
English appointed you to
maintain the accounts.

1107
01:35:16,354 --> 01:35:18,999
But you have dishonored
the women and the country.

1108
01:35:19,398 --> 01:35:21,484
- Did I question about it?
- What are you murmuring about?

1109
01:35:21,799 --> 01:35:24,083
I was thinking about
your stature.

1110
01:35:25,206 --> 01:35:26,912
Tomorrow, be at the bungalow.
- Okay, sir.

1111
01:35:27,039 --> 01:35:28,657
I have passed the information
to Chezhiyan's mother.

1112
01:35:28,936 --> 01:35:30,745
- Advise him.
- Okay, sir.

1113
01:35:31,064 --> 01:35:32,331
- Leave.
- Bye, sir.

1114
01:35:34,351 --> 01:35:35,530
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1115
01:35:35,653 --> 01:35:37,286
Next one has come to plead.

1116
01:35:39,519 --> 01:35:41,946
Kangaani.

1117
01:35:42,501 --> 01:35:43,501
The money...

1118
01:36:15,821 --> 01:36:18,536
Ragu, mom passed me the message.

1119
01:36:19,478 --> 01:36:20,798
Should I come for sure?
- Actually..

1120
01:36:22,319 --> 01:36:24,000
I studied law.

1121
01:36:24,296 --> 01:36:25,987
I'm not known for my patience.

1122
01:36:26,905 --> 01:36:28,609
My mom has taken loan.

1123
01:36:29,617 --> 01:36:30,655
That puts me in the
state of dilemma.

1124
01:36:30,990 --> 01:36:33,293
- We are in the same state as well.
- Hey.

1125
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:34,950
I couldn't say no.

1126
01:36:39,249 --> 01:36:43,136
I will just mind my business.

1127
01:36:44,487 --> 01:36:47,170
I can't address
him like my boss.

1128
01:36:47,547 --> 01:36:49,615
I can't fall on his feet.

1129
01:36:50,495 --> 01:36:51,495
Got it?

1130
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:54,890
Dominating us in our very own place?

1131
01:36:56,184 --> 01:36:57,693
White pigs!

1132
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:03,199
Good times are approaching.

1133
01:37:04,239 --> 01:37:06,378
Think about mom.

1134
01:37:06,869 --> 01:37:08,239
Your ancestors lead
a wealthy life.

1135
01:37:08,350 --> 01:37:09,953
We can just regret.

1136
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:15,291
We are like an animal
attacked by a snake.

1137
01:37:16,413 --> 01:37:17,851
It's we who gets into trouble.

1138
01:37:18,326 --> 01:37:21,003
It's because of this dividedness
we are in this position.

1139
01:37:21,595 --> 01:37:23,304
When we stand united

1140
01:37:23,564 --> 01:37:24,564
then comes the good fortune.

1141
01:37:37,977 --> 01:37:39,961
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings!

1142
01:37:40,335 --> 01:37:42,201
He is a short tempered guy.

1143
01:37:42,762 --> 01:37:44,920
Be patient.
Don't create a ruckus.

1144
01:37:45,688 --> 01:37:48,938
He is a high ranked officer.
Might be helpful to you later.

1145
01:40:25,221 --> 01:40:26,476
Hey, you.
Take some bread.

1146
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:30,503
Take it or I'll shoot you.

1147
01:40:33,901 --> 01:40:34,528
Good.

1148
01:40:34,794 --> 01:40:36,850
He performs the same gimmicks.

1149
01:40:41,739 --> 01:40:43,406
Son of all purpose flour.

1150
01:40:44,651 --> 01:40:46,810
Edible food must sink in water.

1151
01:40:47,112 --> 01:40:48,641
It's floating like a boat.

1152
01:40:49,025 --> 01:40:51,519
It's too bad for digestion.
- Pass it.

1153
01:40:54,025 --> 01:40:55,025
Enough.

1154
01:40:58,997 --> 01:41:01,137
Nair, tea is awesome.

1155
01:41:01,608 --> 01:41:03,637
Is it?
Then give me 2 annas.

1156
01:41:05,337 --> 01:41:08,823
Can you get it?
You are smart.

1157
01:41:26,428 --> 01:41:28,597
- Hey, go and take that.
- Yes.

1158
01:41:39,961 --> 01:41:43,461
Why are you laughing?
Come on..

1159
01:41:43,797 --> 01:41:45,252
- I thought it was a tiger(Puli).
- What?

1160
01:41:46,416 --> 01:41:47,835
I thought it is a tiger.

1161
01:41:47,990 --> 01:41:50,172
- But you shot a rabbit.
- Hey mind it.

1162
01:41:50,664 --> 01:41:53,211
Last trip, I shot around 7 tigers.
You know that?

1163
01:41:53,410 --> 01:41:54,810
For your information.

1164
01:41:56,470 --> 01:41:58,909
I guess it's about to rain.
Shall we make a move?

1165
01:42:00,827 --> 01:42:01,827
Everyone.
Move.

1166
01:42:07,252 --> 01:42:11,038
I'll make sure that I will
shoot a tiger within 24 hours.

1167
01:42:12,215 --> 01:42:13,438
Just, you watch.

1168
01:42:15,188 --> 01:42:16,462
Since the last 25 years..

1169
01:42:16,815 --> 01:42:19,758
they dwindled the number of
tigers from 48,000 to 14,000.

1170
01:42:20,744 --> 01:42:23,717
You can kill the tigers.

1171
01:42:24,181 --> 01:42:25,546
But you can't destroy
it as a whole.

1172
01:42:27,144 --> 01:42:28,144
Which tiger are
you referring to?

1173
01:42:30,056 --> 01:42:33,191
We have to travel a fair distance.
Let's move.

1174
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:05,968
Hey, man.
Come.

1175
01:43:06,009 --> 01:43:07,318
- Lord!
- Let's have a play.

1176
01:43:08,190 --> 01:43:10,086
No..

1177
01:43:10,213 --> 01:43:11,607
Then call your friend.

1178
01:43:12,576 --> 01:43:13,576
Chezhiya!

1179
01:43:15,004 --> 01:43:17,559
Sir wishes to play a game.

1180
01:43:33,917 --> 01:43:36,547
It's we who invented it.
You want to challenge me?

1181
01:43:41,128 --> 01:43:43,864
We will play.
But what's the bet?

1182
01:43:44,413 --> 01:43:45,691
Bet?
With me?

1183
01:43:47,601 --> 01:43:50,040
I'm Inter-Councilor champion.
Grow up.

1184
01:43:50,764 --> 01:43:51,764
Let's play.

1185
01:43:52,989 --> 01:43:53,989
It's okay.

1186
01:43:54,014 --> 01:43:55,825
Let's have a bet.
Onion skin.

1187
01:43:56,115 --> 01:43:57,115
Onion skin?

1188
01:43:57,412 --> 01:43:58,661
I'm ready.

1189
01:44:05,710 --> 01:44:08,183
You are my guest.
Please take your honor.

1190
01:44:09,305 --> 01:44:11,133
Oh great.
Great joke.

1191
01:44:12,290 --> 01:44:13,290
Let's start.

1192
01:46:16,225 --> 01:46:19,430
Is this called the
ripping as a whole?

1193
01:46:21,179 --> 01:46:24,852
He is avenging smartly.

1194
01:47:00,771 --> 01:47:02,349
Check- Mate.

1195
01:47:28,740 --> 01:47:29,740
Hey!

1196
01:47:38,585 --> 01:47:39,585
Grow up, man!

1197
01:48:36,007 --> 01:48:38,414
- Bring me some wood.
- What's your education?

1198
01:48:40,876 --> 01:48:42,592
I did my law.
- Oh good!

1199
01:48:42,940 --> 01:48:44,073
Come to our land!

1200
01:48:44,782 --> 01:48:46,353
I'll give you a good post.

1201
01:48:51,068 --> 01:48:52,135
I'm an independent.

1202
01:48:53,398 --> 01:48:55,721
We need our freedom
from you people.

1203
01:49:03,409 --> 01:49:04,409
Freedom.

1204
01:49:07,819 --> 01:49:09,160
Chezhiya!
Did you call me.

1205
01:49:11,598 --> 01:49:12,731
Nothing to worry.

1206
01:49:17,137 --> 01:49:20,561
By the way, your 24
hours' time is over.

1207
01:49:36,060 --> 01:49:40,012
Kangaani. - Take this Rs.10
Spend wisely.

1208
01:49:40,429 --> 01:49:43,774
Return it on time. Else I won't
be nice. - I'll return it for sure.

1209
01:49:50,224 --> 01:49:51,224
Sir.

1210
01:49:51,438 --> 01:49:53,479
- Keep quiet.
- What happened?

1211
01:49:53,525 --> 01:49:54,708
You are solely
responsible for it.

1212
01:50:10,525 --> 01:50:12,497
- Call Chezhiyan.
- Okay, sir.

1213
01:50:20,811 --> 01:50:22,011
Remove the chairs.

1214
01:50:43,367 --> 01:50:44,538
We have another game.

1215
01:50:47,038 --> 01:50:48,305
Sorry, I have work.

1216
01:50:48,540 --> 01:50:49,740
No, it's my order.

1217
01:50:50,579 --> 01:50:51,579
I have to go.

1218
01:50:54,084 --> 01:50:55,084
Hey, you!

1219
01:50:55,798 --> 01:50:57,321
Bloody..

1220
01:50:57,413 --> 01:50:58,523
You Indian pig.

1221
01:50:58,579 --> 01:51:02,101
You mongrel.
You *****

1222
01:51:26,746 --> 01:51:28,494
He got hit badly.

1223
01:51:28,555 --> 01:51:30,573
He can't speak or hear.

1224
01:51:30,690 --> 01:51:32,839
I don't think that he
will recover from that.

1225
01:51:33,167 --> 01:51:34,167
Sorry!

1226
01:52:14,236 --> 01:52:15,236
Hey, Vidudhalai.

1227
01:52:15,474 --> 01:52:16,474
Where is he?

1228
01:52:18,030 --> 01:52:19,030
I'm asking you.

1229
01:52:25,599 --> 01:52:28,498
In current situation I
can't enter the forest.

1230
01:52:28,907 --> 01:52:30,470
Surveillance has increased.

1231
01:52:31,150 --> 01:52:33,493
Chezhiyan's mother is
safe in Madurai.

1232
01:52:33,890 --> 01:52:35,121
Inform it to Chezhiyan.
- Okay.

1233
01:52:44,963 --> 01:52:45,963
Chezhiya!

1234
01:52:47,261 --> 01:52:48,261
Chezhiya!

1235
01:52:56,609 --> 01:52:57,970
Chezhiya!

1236
01:53:02,033 --> 01:53:03,033
Chezhiya!

1237
01:53:17,789 --> 01:53:21,005
- What's it, Krishna?
- Mom wants to meet you.

1238
01:53:21,598 --> 01:53:23,005
So, I have brought her.

1239
01:53:24,098 --> 01:53:26,368
She is waiting near
Kurinji temple.

1240
01:53:26,787 --> 01:53:27,787
Shall we go?

1241
01:53:32,041 --> 01:53:33,339
You go.
I will come later.

1242
01:53:38,305 --> 01:53:40,602
- Chezhiya!
- Go.

1243
01:54:24,718 --> 01:54:26,719
Why are you silent?

1244
01:54:27,689 --> 01:54:30,475
Where is mom?

1245
01:54:54,834 --> 01:54:58,429
Sir..
The whereabouts of Chezhiyan.

1246
01:55:01,687 --> 01:55:02,687
He knows.

1247
01:55:14,774 --> 01:55:16,764
What do you want?

1248
01:55:22,217 --> 01:55:23,329
I...

1249
01:55:23,717 --> 01:55:24,717
Want..

1250
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:26,400
Kozhikode.

1251
01:55:26,829 --> 01:55:27,829
Tea contract..

1252
01:55:28,154 --> 01:55:29,154
Owner..

1253
01:55:30,030 --> 01:55:32,381
Full control.

1254
01:56:09,494 --> 01:56:11,585
Chezhiya!

1255
01:56:11,807 --> 01:56:14,425
We are betrayed.

1256
01:58:37,449 --> 01:58:38,883
Watch it!

1257
02:06:56,089 --> 02:06:57,853
Sasi, I'm in the place
that you mentioned.

1258
02:06:58,541 --> 02:07:00,117
John, that's the spot.

1259
02:07:00,303 --> 02:07:02,363
Is Metro work under progress there?
- Yes.

1260
02:07:02,510 --> 02:07:04,366
His number is stable
there since a long time.

1261
02:07:04,510 --> 02:07:06,203
Go and look in the subway.

1262
02:07:06,209 --> 02:07:07,873
There are more chances
of meeting him there.

1263
02:07:37,753 --> 02:07:40,579
For safety purpose, I have sent
his photo. Try to identify.

1264
02:07:40,737 --> 02:07:42,441
Okay. - I will reach
the spot in 5 minutes.

1265
02:07:42,832 --> 02:07:45,347
Okay, Sasi. - Also it's an one
way closed subway.

1266
02:07:45,720 --> 02:07:47,477
Definitely, he can't
escape from another way.

1267
02:07:48,052 --> 02:07:49,623
He must cross us.

1268
02:07:50,002 --> 02:07:51,566
There is no problem
of general public.

1269
02:07:52,426 --> 02:07:53,504
Kill him on sight.

1270
02:07:54,421 --> 02:07:55,875
Maximum, I'll be
there in 5 minutes.

1271
02:07:56,292 --> 02:07:57,332
Ok, Sasi.
- I will hold the line.

1272
02:07:57,586 --> 02:07:59,178
You proceed.
- Come soon.

1273
02:08:22,696 --> 02:08:24,701
Give me another packet.
It's too cold.

1274
02:08:24,726 --> 02:08:26,704
You need to pay me for 4 packets.
I want money in the morning.

1275
02:08:26,798 --> 02:08:28,058
I will give.

1276
02:08:36,424 --> 02:08:38,209
You get continuous
holidays after new year.

1277
02:08:41,762 --> 02:08:44,454
Don't shuffle it.
Choose one.

1278
02:08:45,063 --> 02:08:47,817
I'll choose.
Is it of fine quality?

1279
02:08:48,596 --> 02:08:49,720
It's camcorder quality.

1280
02:08:50,157 --> 02:08:52,691
I want to choose my favorite movie.
Make it fast. Time's up.

1281
02:08:52,755 --> 02:08:54,222
Tomorrow is a holiday.

1282
02:08:55,051 --> 02:08:56,051
How many CD's
will you buy?

1283
02:09:29,454 --> 02:09:30,894
Were you able to
identify him, John?

1284
02:09:31,531 --> 02:09:33,770
No, Sasi..
- Hello, are you in the line?

1285
02:09:34,512 --> 02:09:37,307
John, are you able to hear me?
- No, Sasi..

1286
02:09:38,352 --> 02:09:40,552
Hello..
- John..

1287
02:09:40,646 --> 02:09:42,223
Can you hear me?

1288
02:09:42,678 --> 02:09:43,678
Hello.

1289
02:09:46,003 --> 02:09:47,003
John!

1290
02:09:58,528 --> 02:09:59,595
Look over there.

1291
02:10:38,948 --> 02:10:40,213
What's happening?

1292
02:10:45,839 --> 02:10:46,839
Look at that.

1293
02:10:49,306 --> 02:10:50,469
What's happening?

1294
02:10:53,559 --> 02:10:54,738
I'm perplexed.

1295
02:12:24,565 --> 02:12:25,565
Who is it?

1296
02:13:13,962 --> 02:13:14,582
Sasi!

1297
02:13:14,668 --> 02:13:16,001
What happened, John?

1298
02:13:16,143 --> 02:13:17,143
Sasi!

1299
02:13:17,287 --> 02:13:19,525
Stay there..

1300
02:13:20,059 --> 02:13:21,325
Find out who it is.

1301
02:13:26,172 --> 02:13:27,172
Sasi!

1302
02:13:47,557 --> 02:13:48,763
Hey, John!

1303
02:13:51,010 --> 02:13:52,010
Sasi!

1304
02:13:59,881 --> 02:14:00,881
Sasi!

1305
02:14:14,830 --> 02:14:16,062
Are you cheating me?

1306
02:14:17,643 --> 02:14:19,809
I'm warning you.

1307
02:14:25,195 --> 02:14:26,272
Sasi!

1308
02:14:46,558 --> 02:14:48,408
John, Save me!

1309
02:14:52,004 --> 02:14:53,004
Sasi!

1310
02:14:56,891 --> 02:14:57,891
Sasi!

1311
02:15:06,821 --> 02:15:07,821
Sasi!

1312
02:15:14,797 --> 02:15:18,217
The moment I see you
will be your last moment.

1313
02:15:35,497 --> 02:15:36,497
Hey!
