1
00:01:14,888 --> 00:01:24,320
"You are in my heart."

2
00:01:24,798 --> 00:01:31,829
"The partner for all my
lives, we stand united."

3
00:01:32,305 --> 00:01:39,609
"The partner of all my
lives, we stand united."

4
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,540
"A sparkle adorns the eyes."

5
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:49,447
"A pearl adorns the shell."

6
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:56,989
"The partner of all my
lives, we stand united."

7
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:24,854
"Like a swan in a group of swans."

8
00:02:25,525 --> 00:02:30,588
"Like the moonlight in the moon."

9
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:34,892
"Like the imagination of poets."

10
00:02:35,335 --> 00:02:39,897
"Like hope in a heart."

11
00:02:40,607 --> 00:02:47,604
"Like the lamp and it's flame,
we stand together."

12
00:03:11,071 --> 00:03:15,167
"Like mischief filled in eyes."

13
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:20,946
"Like a ploy playing on the lips."

14
00:03:21,248 --> 00:03:25,548
"Like the heart dances in the rain."

15
00:03:25,952 --> 00:03:30,286
"Like a beloved with her lover."

16
00:03:31,157 --> 00:03:38,529
"Like the lamp and it's flame."

17
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:36,552
Wake up.

18
00:05:01,448 --> 00:05:03,609
Another dream.

19
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,451
Good God! Praise the Lord!

20
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:21,931
"The dilicate sons of an
illustrious father."

21
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:31,573
"They possess separate virtues."

22
00:05:32,646 --> 00:05:42,180
"One is learned, the other
is humble and decile."

23
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:52,063
"One is intelligent in business."

24
00:05:52,399 --> 00:06:02,741
"One is very religious
and conscious of duty."

25
00:06:03,543 --> 00:06:11,951
"They are all a shadow
of their father."

26
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:22,660
"One is a devotee of his father,
the other obeys his every word."

27
00:06:23,296 --> 00:06:33,103
"Even in dreams they don't
wish evil for anybody."

28
00:06:36,476 --> 00:06:37,773
Brother and sister-in-law!

29
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:41,606
Our best wishes for your
25th wedding anniversary!

30
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:43,379
Thank you, sir.

31
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,483
How is our attorney
without his black coat?

32
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,310
I've taken leave from court.

33
00:06:48,855 --> 00:06:53,349
If I'd have gone to work today.
I don't know what my sister would say!

34
00:06:54,327 --> 00:06:55,851
No public prosecutor
would be able to help me.

35
00:06:56,062 --> 00:06:58,087
See how he is teasing me!

36
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:00,725
Have a sweet, Ram Kishen.

37
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:03,936
On this day, he will eat if
his wife feeds him not you.

38
00:07:04,437 --> 00:07:07,895
Sweetmeat made by you. Terrific!

39
00:07:09,175 --> 00:07:12,076
Great! Give some to the kids.

40
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:15,310
You're the last to
come for the prayers.

41
00:07:15,648 --> 00:07:16,945
And right in front for the sweets!

42
00:07:17,317 --> 00:07:20,218
I was right in time. Ask brother.

43
00:07:20,754 --> 00:07:23,780
Happy anniversary.
- Live long.

44
00:07:24,057 --> 00:07:27,891
He's getting spoilt
because you pamper him!

45
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:30,491
Mother...
- Have one.

46
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:33,865
Sir...
- Mr. Khan?

47
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:37,231
Happy anniversary.
- Thank you so much.

48
00:07:37,871 --> 00:07:44,208
Best wishes from our
office and factory staff.

49
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:49,047
Mr. Vivek, I've made the list of
the guests for tonight's function.

50
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:52,873
Are you my secretary or the kids'?

51
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,412
They've been busy with arranging
the function for a whole week.

52
00:07:57,757 --> 00:08:01,557
Frankly speaking, these are the
occasions to share joys with all.

53
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:05,327
The entire family meets
under this pretext.

54
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:08,860
Where's that friend of yours, Anwar?

55
00:08:09,102 --> 00:08:13,436
That's how it's so calm. He's gone
to pick up Sangita and Anand babu.

56
00:08:15,742 --> 00:08:17,505
Sounds like Sangita and
our son-in-law are here!

57
00:08:18,044 --> 00:08:20,069
Grandma!

58
00:08:23,683 --> 00:08:26,049
My dear...

59
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,752
Enough... welcome.

60
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:36,895
Brother!

61
00:08:37,163 --> 00:08:39,256
Anurag and his wife, Jyoti
are not to be seen.

62
00:08:39,499 --> 00:08:42,093
You know my elder brother
has no time for himself.

63
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:45,729
Doesn't matter. At least
their two children are her.

64
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:48,473
They have grown so attached
to us that it's amazing.

65
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:51,340
I feel I have 3 grand children.

66
00:08:52,846 --> 00:08:54,404
Take these...

67
00:08:55,815 --> 00:09:00,377
Just give them one. Their
pockets are full of chocolates.

68
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:05,253
Before us, who gave them chocolates?

69
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:07,918
Who else but Anwar spoils them?

70
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:11,788
You make mistakes and
hold me responsible for it?

71
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:13,855
What have I done?

72
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,599
You come here just once a year.
Isn't that bad enough?

73
00:09:18,071 --> 00:09:21,131
And look at her cheek!
Where has she gone?

74
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,570
Says, we mustn't spoil the kids.
- I apologize. Sorry.

75
00:09:25,478 --> 00:09:26,945
What do you say?

76
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:30,745
You are forgiven.
Have some sweets.

77
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:37,649
Papa, he got it
stitched in his presence.

78
00:09:39,225 --> 00:09:40,715
And this is for you.

79
00:09:41,294 --> 00:09:43,455
This too is his choice.

80
00:09:44,597 --> 00:09:48,226
He's got great selection!

81
00:09:49,102 --> 00:09:51,036
He has knowledge of everything.

82
00:09:51,704 --> 00:09:53,968
You and Mummy have to wear
these in the function.

83
00:09:54,407 --> 00:09:56,602
And what will the children wear?

84
00:09:57,043 --> 00:09:59,170
I'll wear an achkan.
- I'll wear a skirt and scarf.

85
00:09:59,545 --> 00:10:00,739
What about you?

86
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:03,709
I'll wear a silk achkan
and an embroidered fez cap.

87
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:05,547
Excuse me.
- Yes?

88
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:07,178
Don't you have to go to your shop?

89
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,253
Today is a holiday.
- I had a dream last night.

90
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:14,658
Anwar Band & Co. Is locked up!

91
00:10:15,328 --> 00:10:19,731
Of course. He's here all day.
How does he run his shop?

92
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:24,263
It's doing very well. Thank you.
Anyway what does man need?

93
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:26,832
Mother feeds me great food.

94
00:10:27,273 --> 00:10:29,707
And father teaches me
good lessons of life.

95
00:10:32,111 --> 00:10:36,275
Everyone should have one
such friend in their lives.

96
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:39,181
But my friend still hasn't turned up.

97
00:10:39,552 --> 00:10:42,453
I'm dead tired! Anybody there?

98
00:10:43,957 --> 00:10:45,584
Quickly hide the food!

99
00:10:46,893 --> 00:10:48,827
Hide it.

100
00:10:49,395 --> 00:10:51,454
What's wrong, Pritam uncle.
- Don't ask, son.

101
00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:54,494
It's his 25th anniversary
and I had to make 25 trips!

102
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:57,129
Hunting for a gift for him!

103
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,529
Where's my gift?
- There he comes to the point!

104
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,337
Just a minute. A pocket
watch for your coat.

105
00:11:04,911 --> 00:11:08,779
And earrings for you!

106
00:11:09,682 --> 00:11:12,480
Matching today's outfits.
- You're very forward!

107
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:15,913
Did you know what son-in-law
was going to present them!

108
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:20,216
Is he only your son-in-law?
Does he mean nothing to me?

109
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,157
Look at that veil!
- Aunt dearest...

110
00:11:24,397 --> 00:11:26,262
Caught you! Caught the sweets!

111
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:30,963
Just one. The doctor's orders.

112
00:11:31,204 --> 00:11:35,504
Forget it! Just because my daughter
has become a doctor, life is tough!

113
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,040
Making me diet forever!
- But where is Preeti?

114
00:11:38,244 --> 00:11:39,871
Must be on her way with Dr. Sen.

115
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:42,739
Congratulations.
- Thank you, doctor.

116
00:11:45,284 --> 00:11:49,550
Where is Preeti?
- Oh, where is she?

117
00:11:52,925 --> 00:11:57,328
Just you wait!
- Hey, listen...!

118
00:11:58,031 --> 00:12:01,364
These girls are worse than boys!

119
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:05,194
Childhood friends meet and that's it!

120
00:12:12,712 --> 00:12:14,907
The progress is much
better than I thought.

121
00:12:17,116 --> 00:12:22,349
God willing, we'll get
some movement in his hand.

122
00:12:22,822 --> 00:12:25,848
We have full faith since
we came in touch with you.

123
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:27,754
Don't be silly.

124
00:12:28,194 --> 00:12:31,391
Homeopathy is effective even
in the most serious ailments.

125
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:33,326
Even if it's a childhood injury.

126
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:37,502
It will be effective only when
Vivek takes medication in time.

127
00:12:37,804 --> 00:12:40,671
Anwar posters him so he takes it
else he is so busy with work.

128
00:12:41,707 --> 00:12:45,336
The bottle of pills
is always in my pocket.

129
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:49,446
Then whether he yells or screams
I pop the pills in his mouth.

130
00:12:49,816 --> 00:12:52,751
Open your mouth
It's time for your dose.

131
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:57,718
Whether my arm gets better or not...

132
00:12:58,124 --> 00:13:05,030
One thing is for sure, soon we're
going to get a strict but good doctor.

133
00:13:05,398 --> 00:13:08,799
Don't praise her so much
that she starts flying high!

134
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,706
What a tragedy! I started
restaurants in my daughter's name.

135
00:13:14,941 --> 00:13:17,432
How often I've told her to go
there and eat and feed friends.

136
00:13:17,677 --> 00:13:20,669
But no way. I don't know what's
the charm in your profession!

137
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,140
Uncle always talks like
this when he's hungry.

138
00:13:24,383 --> 00:13:27,375
You'll realize when you have to
eat carrots and cucumber all day!

139
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:31,785
But I won't pay heed
to her in the party.

140
00:13:32,091 --> 00:13:34,389
Prem returns today. I'll
gorge to my heart's content!

141
00:13:36,062 --> 00:13:38,792
I'll meet Prem in the evening.

142
00:13:51,878 --> 00:13:56,144
Our second brother, Prem
returns from America today.

143
00:13:56,616 --> 00:13:59,813
Would you like to express
the depth of your happiness?

144
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:02,852
Why do you keep
troubling the poor girl?

145
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:08,082
Don't we know someday these
two hearts are going to be one?

146
00:14:09,295 --> 00:14:11,729
Who has gone to the
airport to pick him up?

147
00:14:12,498 --> 00:14:15,160
Nobody.
- Why?

148
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:19,461
His instructions are clear. Nobody
need come there, just send the car.

149
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:23,197
My younger brother doesn't
want to trouble anybody.

150
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:26,401
He's a real saint.

151
00:14:26,712 --> 00:14:29,442
God knows what will
happen to this boy.

152
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:32,411
He's one in a million.

153
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:35,912
Sir has called you to the hall.
The decorators have arrived.

154
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:42,023
Do you know how Preeti blushes
the moment she hears Prem's name?

155
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:44,725
Like Anwar blushes at seeing you!

156
00:14:48,234 --> 00:14:51,101
I swear, what a dangerous man!

157
00:14:54,106 --> 00:14:56,040
Once more.

158
00:15:08,487 --> 00:15:10,751
When did you come?
- Just now.

159
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,058
Father and grandma too are here.
- Grandma has come!

160
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:22,857
Will you let go?

161
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:34,206
The foreigner returns home.

162
00:15:34,347 --> 00:15:37,783
Finally my eyes are at rest.

163
00:15:39,252 --> 00:15:43,916
Aunt, we really appreciate it that
you came from the village for us.

164
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:48,225
We had to come. After all
we belong to the same village.

165
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:50,762
And neighbors at that.

166
00:15:51,497 --> 00:15:53,124
Take charge of the function.

167
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,531
I've brought all the articles
for the stage decoration.

168
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,564
The decoration will be
according to the music.

169
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,138
Because uncle loves music.

170
00:16:05,144 --> 00:16:07,772
Sapna really works very hard.

171
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:10,005
Always first in college.

172
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:12,911
She lends you a helping hand at
home and her father at work.

173
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:15,253
And take a look at my son, Vinod.

174
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:17,352
He wakes up at 8!

175
00:16:22,028 --> 00:16:27,557
We're beginning the second round.
Has your father finished his prayers?

176
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:42,342
Whenever I step into this house,
I feel I'm entering a palace!

177
00:16:42,982 --> 00:16:45,507
I have a small sari-making
factory in Rampur.

178
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:49,048
On the other hand, Ram Kishen
has these great industries!

179
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:55,225
Lord, let my daughter marry
his younger son, Vinod.

180
00:16:55,594 --> 00:16:57,494
And she inherits one
third of the property!

181
00:16:58,064 --> 00:17:00,089
She will have servants around her!

182
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,233
And she'll live like a queen!

183
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:10,404
We've bought sweetmeats
from all the famous places.

184
00:17:11,077 --> 00:17:14,808
That's not fair. You always get
so many sweets each time you come!

185
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:18,380
Just a little. Only for tasting.

186
00:17:18,784 --> 00:17:21,048
That's the spirit!

187
00:17:21,354 --> 00:17:26,451
Excuse me but everybody
in Rampur worships Ram Kishen.

188
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,950
He's done so much for rhe village!

189
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:31,728
Built colleges and hospitals!

190
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:37,329
Now he's building a big factory
that will enhance the village.

191
00:17:37,837 --> 00:17:41,830
Vivek too has worked hard on it.

192
00:17:42,274 --> 00:17:45,004
Mother, he is the lamp of the family!

193
00:17:45,277 --> 00:17:47,541
He loves his brother so much!

194
00:17:48,247 --> 00:17:51,216
He trained Prem in business
and sent him abroad.

195
00:17:51,484 --> 00:17:53,975
For further studies. And now...

196
00:17:55,121 --> 00:17:57,885
He's preparing Vinod for business.

197
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:06,995
So Vinod now helps Vivek?

198
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:11,129
Helps? He just carries his briefcase.

199
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:15,369
So what? That's how Prem started.

200
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:17,438
Isn't that so, Vivek?

201
00:18:17,676 --> 00:18:19,439
Prem does that even today.

202
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:45,832
Prem has come.

203
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:47,766
He's here?

204
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,988
Mother...
- Go away.

205
00:19:03,355 --> 00:19:06,984
Mother is annoyed because you
didn't come home in the last vacation.

206
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:10,160
I'll get her round.

207
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,873
Where there's laughter
on the dining table...

208
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:29,107
Where the ladies and girls of
the family lovingly feed us...

209
00:19:29,348 --> 00:19:31,908
That truly is a home!

210
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:42,487
Here's your favorite porridge.

211
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:47,689
You never fed us with such love.

212
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:49,796
We only have an aunt.

213
00:19:50,636 --> 00:19:53,161
Here you are, baby.

214
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:56,565
Take this too. Piping hot samosas.

215
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,010
Serve me one too.
- You too will have?

216
00:20:00,246 --> 00:20:03,682
I prefer the spicy to sweet.

217
00:20:11,257 --> 00:20:12,747
Some more tea?

218
00:20:13,158 --> 00:20:15,422
What about you?
- No.

219
00:20:15,928 --> 00:20:17,793
What? Go on. Serve him.

220
00:20:18,864 --> 00:20:21,059
What a scene!

221
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:31,499
Better get used to it. She's
going to feed you all your life.

222
00:20:33,812 --> 00:20:36,781
Where are you going? Sit down!

223
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:43,116
Mumu baby! Where are you?

224
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,690
There they come!

225
00:20:51,363 --> 00:20:53,763
Congratulations, queen mother!

226
00:21:03,075 --> 00:21:06,135
Brother-in-law! Congratulations!

227
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:10,811
I can understand that you call
your friend Mumu out of love.

228
00:21:11,216 --> 00:21:13,650
But how does he become
your brother-in-law?

229
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:18,318
The husband of our friend
is our brother-in-law.

230
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:20,588
You are great!

231
00:21:20,793 --> 00:21:22,317
You've come so late!

232
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:24,961
Last night we had such
a game of cards in the club...

233
00:21:25,364 --> 00:21:28,856
...that it ended at 4 AM and
you know we can't wake up early.

234
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:40,810
They wake up late and
stay here till very late!

235
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,942
There are fights in
every family these days!

236
00:21:44,316 --> 00:21:47,308
Fights between brothers, parents,
between mother and daughter-in-law!

237
00:21:50,322 --> 00:21:54,588
I think the moment sons get
married, they should be seperated.

238
00:21:54,927 --> 00:21:56,918
Separate homes, work. That's it.

239
00:21:57,162 --> 00:21:58,959
That's the duty of parents today.

240
00:21:59,198 --> 00:22:01,029
I don't agree.

241
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:04,167
The joy you can get together
is impossible living alone.

242
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:08,563
Man can overcome any problem
if his family is united.

243
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,668
Breaking up disperses the energy.

244
00:22:11,977 --> 00:22:13,501
Think of the children.

245
00:22:13,912 --> 00:22:18,110
Why should the grandchildren be
deprived of the love of grandparents?

246
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:21,652
Absolutely. The duty of parents is...

247
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,912
to inculcate the right
values from childhood.

248
00:22:25,391 --> 00:22:29,487
So they can share each others
joys and sorrows in togetherness.

249
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:33,090
Would you like to bet on it?

250
00:22:33,332 --> 00:22:35,357
Don't you have to get ready?

251
00:22:36,201 --> 00:22:38,226
My discussion with
Ram Kishen will continue.

252
00:22:38,804 --> 00:22:42,467
Now we have to get dressed.
See you in the evening.

253
00:22:48,614 --> 00:22:50,775
Thank you brother.

254
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:58,078
Tell the lawyer, see you.

255
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:05,487
You really have strange friends.

256
00:23:06,031 --> 00:23:09,364
They always talk of breaking
homes never bonding families.

257
00:23:11,236 --> 00:23:18,233
But it is true that the importance
of relationships is lost today.

258
00:23:19,778 --> 00:23:23,305
In such times, your family
and the love you share...

259
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:26,248
It is an exemplary guiding light.

260
00:23:26,552 --> 00:23:30,852
Mother, his entire life is exemplary!

261
00:23:31,623 --> 00:23:36,083
My sister, Mamta has supported
you ably on this journey.

262
00:23:36,328 --> 00:23:38,853
Isn't it?
- Definitely.

263
00:23:39,598 --> 00:23:43,295
What did I have when
Mamta married me?

264
00:23:45,104 --> 00:23:48,767
Loneliness and a year
old Vivek in my arms.

265
00:23:51,944 --> 00:23:57,576
There's no comparison to the
love Mamta has showered Vivek.

266
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:03,087
Do you know what gift I
presented to your sister today?

267
00:24:03,922 --> 00:24:05,947
I've given her a promise.

268
00:24:06,325 --> 00:24:09,761
The day I see the faces
of my three daughters-in-law

269
00:24:10,028 --> 00:24:13,429
All my time will be hers.

270
00:24:13,665 --> 00:24:17,192
The moments of joy I couldn't
give her because of my duties,

271
00:24:17,469 --> 00:24:19,300
will all be hers.

272
00:24:19,571 --> 00:24:23,166
When do we hear the wedding
march for Vivek's wedding?

273
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:28,242
I pray for that day.

274
00:24:29,948 --> 00:24:34,885
We received many proposals
but because of Vivek's arm...

275
00:24:35,287 --> 00:24:38,814
Those matches? Not one
was worthy of Vivek!

276
00:24:39,258 --> 00:24:45,163
Yes, man is recognized by his
heart not his physical being.

277
00:24:46,098 --> 00:24:50,694
And we will find somebody
who will value his golden heart.

278
00:25:04,082 --> 00:25:05,606
Come in, dear.

279
00:25:12,191 --> 00:25:14,591
How are you?
- Fine.

280
00:25:14,927 --> 00:25:16,861
Sadhna, this is Vivek.

281
00:25:17,095 --> 00:25:18,960
Ram Kishen's eldest son.

282
00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:20,560
My daughter, Sadhna.

283
00:25:23,836 --> 00:25:25,770
Welcome.

284
00:25:30,676 --> 00:25:35,443
Mr. Adarsh is very respected
industrialist of our city.

285
00:25:35,981 --> 00:25:39,280
He has just settled here after
established business abroad.

286
00:25:39,618 --> 00:25:44,282
We've come quite close these days
thanks to association meetings.

287
00:25:45,324 --> 00:25:47,849
This far we only met in meetings.

288
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:53,129
You have honored us by
inviting us for a family function.

289
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,631
My daughter, Sadhna.

290
00:25:57,369 --> 00:25:59,394
Live long.

291
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,483
Nobody can tell that
you grew up abroad.

292
00:26:12,918 --> 00:26:16,911
An Indian is an Indian
wherever he be, isn't it?

293
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:23,891
This is Prem, the second son.

294
00:26:24,162 --> 00:26:28,223
And this is Vinod, the youngest
and the most mischievous!

295
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:40,539
What do you think of the decoration?

296
00:26:40,913 --> 00:26:43,677
Beautiful.
- She's done it all.

297
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:46,350
What color selection!
What flower arrangement!

298
00:26:47,552 --> 00:26:51,215
Ladies love flattery
but only from the heart.

299
00:26:51,523 --> 00:26:54,219
Isn't it, Sadhna?
- That's the problem with ladies!

300
00:26:54,693 --> 00:26:58,185
Either way you're in hot soup.
Raju, Bablu, I'll give you a tip.

301
00:26:58,697 --> 00:27:00,528
You can never win with ladies.

302
00:27:01,733 --> 00:27:03,633
Then why do you fight them?

303
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,766
Hear! Brother, you are an angel!

304
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,600
And you're human. Learn
from commiting mistakes.

305
00:27:12,577 --> 00:27:15,546
You must have one sweet at this.

306
00:27:15,814 --> 00:27:17,714
At least one.

307
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,616
What about your family members?

308
00:27:20,852 --> 00:27:22,979
Only Papa and me.

309
00:27:23,388 --> 00:27:27,381
How nice a family can be
with siblings and parents...

310
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:30,853
I realize that only today.

311
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:41,831
Ram Kishen and his wife
have our blessings today.

312
00:27:42,174 --> 00:27:44,904
May they always smile together.

313
00:27:46,478 --> 00:27:51,347
Just a minute. And now
I request Ram Kishen...

314
00:27:51,616 --> 00:27:58,454
He must say something in his
exclusive style for his wife!

315
00:28:07,499 --> 00:28:10,059
I love you very much.

316
00:28:18,744 --> 00:28:23,044
You have to repeat the words you
just said thrice a day all your life!

317
00:28:26,451 --> 00:28:28,043
Now it's your turn.

318
00:28:28,253 --> 00:28:30,050
No...!
- What?

319
00:28:30,222 --> 00:28:32,782
You have to speak. Come here.

320
00:28:39,498 --> 00:28:41,728
I...

321
00:28:44,336 --> 00:28:50,605
I love the children very much!

322
00:28:51,243 --> 00:28:53,973
It's done!
- Come on.

323
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:19,396
"It is true that God exists."

324
00:29:19,905 --> 00:29:24,274
"He exists but is not visible."

325
00:29:35,153 --> 00:29:44,460
"Our parents are the identification
of the Creator on this earth."

326
00:30:30,842 --> 00:30:35,302
"He gave us birth and his name."

327
00:30:35,814 --> 00:30:41,309
"Holding his hand we
grew from childhood."

328
00:30:50,896 --> 00:30:55,526
"We saw the world
perched on his shoulder."

329
00:30:55,934 --> 00:31:02,567
"From him, we learnt to
differentiate between good and bad."

330
00:31:03,575 --> 00:31:08,035
"How does one account
for all the obligations?"

331
00:31:08,446 --> 00:31:13,076
"It's not easy to describe."

332
00:32:06,805 --> 00:32:11,469
"The one who gives birth
is called mother by all."

333
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:17,443
"Her life lies in her children."

334
00:32:26,925 --> 00:32:32,261
"Lullabies on her lips,
her eyes spin dreams for us."

335
00:32:32,597 --> 00:32:39,002
"She gives up her sleep for us,
bears every sorrow with a smile."

336
00:32:39,671 --> 00:32:44,165
"God Himself is seen in her form."

337
00:32:44,676 --> 00:32:49,136
"We have been blessed by you."

338
00:32:49,648 --> 00:32:59,250
"Today your dreams have
grown up in our shape."

339
00:33:45,403 --> 00:33:55,108
We pray to the omnipotent Lord."

340
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:10,627
"May we live under their
shadow till the world exists."

341
00:34:10,995 --> 00:34:16,456
"We can't live without
them for a moment."

342
00:34:18,436 --> 00:34:22,668
"May both of you live forever."

343
00:34:23,141 --> 00:34:28,875
"That is the hope in our hearts."

344
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,625
Why are you so worried?

345
00:35:50,895 --> 00:35:54,695
It is a worrying matter!
What did Adarsh say on the phone?

346
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:57,659
He's coming here for
some urgent business.

347
00:35:58,136 --> 00:35:59,501
But we met yesterday.

348
00:36:00,104 --> 00:36:02,629
And why does he want
sister-in-law to be present?

349
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:07,109
You are not aware of business deals.

350
00:36:07,745 --> 00:36:10,475
He will first give you
gifts, flatter you.

351
00:36:10,815 --> 00:36:13,978
Then he'll get Ram Kishen
to do his work.

352
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:16,312
Why are you getting crazy?

353
00:36:16,554 --> 00:36:18,784
He's a real gentleman.

354
00:36:21,226 --> 00:36:23,717
Mr. Adarsh is here.

355
00:36:25,096 --> 00:36:27,223
Welcome.

356
00:36:33,004 --> 00:36:35,029
He's already here!

357
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,599
Last evening we had the opportunity
to come close to your family.

358
00:36:41,145 --> 00:36:47,209
Frankly speaking, yesterday I saw
how love can make a home a temple.

359
00:36:49,387 --> 00:36:53,153
I come here today with
a desire in my heart.

360
00:36:53,658 --> 00:37:00,063
Honor me by accepting my
daughter's hand for your son Vivek.

361
00:37:03,835 --> 00:37:08,135
I came here with Sadhna
only with this dream.

362
00:37:08,673 --> 00:37:12,700
So that she meets you,
Vivek and the family.

363
00:37:13,578 --> 00:37:16,604
After meeting all of you.
My daughter is no longer mine.

364
00:37:16,981 --> 00:37:18,448
She has changed totally.

365
00:37:19,317 --> 00:37:21,911
Please accept her.

366
00:37:23,087 --> 00:37:24,315
Where are you going?

367
00:37:24,522 --> 00:37:26,319
To get sweets for all.

368
00:37:26,691 --> 00:37:30,092
That's great! Then it's fixed!

369
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:34,127
What are you thinking of?

370
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:40,196
I'm amazed at the forms in which
God comes to spread happiness.

371
00:37:40,538 --> 00:37:44,702
We've heard everything.

372
00:37:46,744 --> 00:37:48,541
I'm so elated today!

373
00:37:55,553 --> 00:37:57,680
Why are you thinking of this?

374
00:37:57,956 --> 00:38:00,925
Sadhna and her father
know about your arm.

375
00:38:01,326 --> 00:38:04,921
There's a difference between
knowing and being together for life.

376
00:38:06,798 --> 00:38:10,529
We have no right to
play with somebody's life.

377
00:38:13,104 --> 00:38:14,935
Your arm will be better someday.

378
00:38:16,407 --> 00:38:19,342
Swear by Allah...
- Only on the hope...

379
00:38:19,677 --> 00:38:22,202
We can't snatch somebody's joys.

380
00:38:23,047 --> 00:38:25,413
I don't want to keep her in the dark.

381
00:38:26,551 --> 00:38:30,317
I've written everything to her in
a letter. I hope she understands.

382
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:33,418
And will marry somebody else.

383
00:38:35,827 --> 00:38:38,261
Listen to him! Sent her a letter!

384
00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:40,156
He talks like a kid!

385
00:38:40,431 --> 00:38:42,456
Talk some sense into him!

386
00:38:44,435 --> 00:38:46,426
You don't know women.

387
00:38:46,804 --> 00:38:48,465
She doesn't fear darkness.

388
00:38:48,906 --> 00:38:51,101
When she makes up her mind...

389
00:38:51,442 --> 00:38:54,775
She lights the lamp of
trust in her heart!

390
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,871
She adorns her hair with it.

391
00:38:59,117 --> 00:39:01,176
Yes brother.

392
00:39:03,421 --> 00:39:06,117
We took your letter there.

393
00:39:06,424 --> 00:39:08,722
And brought the answer back.

394
00:39:54,605 --> 00:39:58,632
"The elder brother
of little brothers."

395
00:40:01,512 --> 00:40:05,380
"Today you will become
somebody's beloved."

396
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,461
"The beating of drums and
blowing of bugles..."

397
00:40:18,663 --> 00:40:22,793
"Happy times have come."

398
00:40:45,356 --> 00:40:50,453
"During Holi we and
our sister-in-law..."

399
00:40:51,963 --> 00:40:56,764
"We'll play with color."

400
00:41:05,743 --> 00:41:12,444
"When Diwali comes by,
we'll light lamps together."

401
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:16,151
"She'll shield us with her veil."

402
00:41:22,894 --> 00:41:26,660
"She'll be the cool wind."

403
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:22,175
"The eyes have turned moist."

404
00:42:24,121 --> 00:42:28,956
"The childhood memories
come flooding back."

405
00:42:37,902 --> 00:42:44,808
"On this journey of life,
you will be bonded by love."

406
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:49,842
"How handsome my elder brother is."

407
00:42:55,253 --> 00:42:59,747
"Like Lord Rama on his
way to wed Mother Sita."

408
00:43:48,806 --> 00:43:50,967
Hello.
- Welcome.

409
00:43:57,048 --> 00:44:00,609
Stretch your hand to accept the bride.

410
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:46,661
When we were abroad, I'd wonder
with little Sadhna in my lap...

411
00:44:47,898 --> 00:44:51,994
How should I teach her our culture?

412
00:44:52,403 --> 00:44:56,965
But I saw I didn't have
to make any efforts.

413
00:44:57,241 --> 00:44:59,937
Automatically she imbibed
all these qualities.

414
00:45:00,311 --> 00:45:02,711
Today I know why.

415
00:45:03,214 --> 00:45:07,810
She had to bind a cord to your family.

416
00:45:11,322 --> 00:45:14,155
Go, my child. To your house.

417
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:29,430
Sister-in-law...

418
00:45:40,985 --> 00:45:42,782
This is Anurag and Jyoti.

419
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,088
Anand's brother and his wife.

420
00:45:47,691 --> 00:45:50,854
Be happy. Congratulations, Vivek.

421
00:45:52,063 --> 00:45:55,123
Jyoti really takes care of Sangita.

422
00:45:55,399 --> 00:45:58,391
Like a little sister.
- She is worth it.

423
00:45:58,869 --> 00:46:01,736
Both my kids only stay with her.

424
00:46:02,706 --> 00:46:04,731
Come and take her blessings.

425
00:46:08,379 --> 00:46:10,279
Bravo!

426
00:46:10,648 --> 00:46:12,513
All the young members of the
family must touch her feet.

427
00:46:12,817 --> 00:46:14,614
The first is Vinod. Where is he?

428
00:46:14,952 --> 00:46:19,150
Call Vinod.
- All right.

429
00:46:25,229 --> 00:46:27,891
You...?
- I've come to see you.

430
00:46:28,132 --> 00:46:29,565
To see me?

431
00:46:31,435 --> 00:46:33,403
Uncle has called for you!

432
00:46:36,273 --> 00:46:41,768
If we keep meeting like this,
someday you'll fall in love.

433
00:46:46,684 --> 00:46:49,346
Touch your sister-in-law's feet.

434
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,212
We have a different tuning.

435
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:57,093
Touch her feet.

436
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:02,396
Can't straighten my back!
- What acting!

437
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,598
Prem, come on.
- Go on, son.

438
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:09,731
One moment. How can he touch
her feet? He's elder to her.

439
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:14,636
Prem is younger to Vivek so
she is elder to him in relation.

440
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:29,883
I am here, on the way.

441
00:47:30,828 --> 00:47:33,661
Are you elder or younger to Vivek?
- Why?

442
00:47:33,898 --> 00:47:37,231
We have to fix your relation with her.

443
00:47:37,635 --> 00:47:39,933
What's my age?
- Whatever it be...

444
00:47:40,404 --> 00:47:42,702
You are elder to me in every form.

445
00:47:44,008 --> 00:47:45,999
No, dear sister-in-law!

446
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:49,143
You can't escape this bond.

447
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:54,417
He's loved Vivek more than a brother.

448
00:47:55,052 --> 00:47:58,988
To tell the truth, he's handing
over his Vivek to you today.

449
00:47:59,256 --> 00:48:01,019
Father...!

450
00:48:01,292 --> 00:48:04,989
Now reduce your trips here.
Your friends belongs to her.

451
00:48:05,262 --> 00:48:07,560
And the world is your foe.

452
00:48:09,366 --> 00:48:13,325
Excuse me, but I'm one
of the shameless ones!

453
00:48:13,704 --> 00:48:16,502
I'm not going to let go so easily.

454
00:48:17,808 --> 00:48:21,141
Sister-in-law whether you
treat me as your own or not...

455
00:48:21,378 --> 00:48:24,575
You are stuck with me!

456
00:48:36,493 --> 00:48:38,393
Brothers and sisters...

457
00:48:38,596 --> 00:48:42,794
The eldest daughter-in-law in
our nation is welcomed with love.

458
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:44,892
This function of today...

459
00:48:45,135 --> 00:48:48,195
is to welcome the bride home!

460
00:49:10,728 --> 00:49:13,526
"Listen to what we have
to say, dear bride."

461
00:49:13,797 --> 00:49:16,527
"Meet your new family."

462
00:49:17,301 --> 00:49:23,240
"We'll introduce you to all,
tell you their secrets too."

463
00:49:33,751 --> 00:49:39,815
"First of all meet the head of
the family, your father-in-law."

464
00:49:40,457 --> 00:49:46,794
"He is crowned with joys.
Take a look at him."

465
00:50:02,446 --> 00:50:06,974
"I'm an inhabitant of Rampur.
My name is Ram Kishen."

466
00:50:07,518 --> 00:50:11,955
"I talk and work straight."

467
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:16,857
"All that I ever wished for..."

468
00:50:17,294 --> 00:50:21,788
"God granted my wishes."

469
00:50:33,444 --> 00:50:36,902
"I travelled the world over."

470
00:50:37,548 --> 00:50:43,043
"But I couldn't forget the
aroma of the soil of my village."

471
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:47,579
"The old jaggery, grams
and milk for breakfast..."

472
00:50:47,891 --> 00:50:52,590
"I could never eat
with a fork and knife."

473
00:50:52,996 --> 00:50:56,295
"Despite all this..."

474
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:03,932
"I still learnt these
new techniques with love."

475
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:25,454
"Now we'd like you to meet
your mother-in-law."

476
00:51:26,263 --> 00:51:38,733
"She rules the household.
She has her special style."

477
00:51:50,754 --> 00:51:54,781
"My name is Mumu..."

478
00:51:55,592 --> 00:51:59,528
"Three butterflies are my
pals and I love parties!"

479
00:52:11,575 --> 00:52:15,443
"I can haggle a mean
bargain while shopping."

480
00:52:16,113 --> 00:52:20,379
"I'll only pay a buck
if it's worth just that."

481
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:25,181
"I have tall tales to tell but I
must leave for the beauty parlor."

482
00:52:35,899 --> 00:52:39,835
"I love dressing up.
Forget the age catching up!"

483
00:52:53,717 --> 00:53:00,054
"Dear bride, let's proceed to meet
your husband's sister and husband."

484
00:53:00,524 --> 00:53:06,724
"He won't annoy his wife.
They are loving natured."

485
00:53:22,212 --> 00:53:25,443
"Radhika's Daddy, come here."

486
00:53:25,983 --> 00:53:30,317
"Darling, what's your command?"

487
00:53:30,954 --> 00:53:34,651
"Tell me how my sari is."

488
00:53:35,058 --> 00:53:39,927
"This admirer loves it."

489
00:53:53,477 --> 00:53:57,208
"I have a headache.
- I'll press it for you."

490
00:53:57,748 --> 00:54:02,776
"- I don't want to cook.
- Then I'll make dinner."

491
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:10,656
"Let's go out.
- Wherever you wish."

492
00:54:11,194 --> 00:54:15,893
"We'll eat dinner out.
- Don't you worry."

493
00:54:18,235 --> 00:54:21,830
"Then we'll also have ice cream."

494
00:54:22,139 --> 00:54:26,542
"Order whatever you feel."

495
00:54:27,177 --> 00:54:31,011
"Get me a sweet betel leaf."

496
00:54:31,148 --> 00:54:35,778
"Smile a little, my darling."

497
00:54:36,086 --> 00:54:39,886
"Carry my purse."

498
00:54:40,157 --> 00:54:44,856
"Darling, it's your day."

499
00:54:58,942 --> 00:55:02,378
"Now you must be alert, dear bride."

500
00:55:02,613 --> 00:55:07,778
"Meet your youngest brother-in-law.
He's very naughty, amiable natured."

501
00:55:08,352 --> 00:55:17,385
"His style is mischievous."

502
00:55:31,642 --> 00:55:35,772
"Papa says I'll make
a name for myself."

503
00:55:36,446 --> 00:55:40,382
"Our son will do some deeds."

504
00:55:40,751 --> 00:55:43,117
"The dreams of Papa..."

505
00:55:43,353 --> 00:55:50,987
"Will be fulfilled
by this young man.

506
00:55:55,565 --> 00:56:03,301
"Innocent face, mischief in
mind, big talk but small job."

507
00:56:07,978 --> 00:56:11,812
"The one who sleeps till 8..."

508
00:56:12,249 --> 00:56:16,083
"Such men never make it big."

509
00:56:16,353 --> 00:56:20,346
"Those who have dreams
in their eyes..."

510
00:56:20,557 --> 00:56:23,617
"They are not
conscious of themselves."

511
00:56:24,394 --> 00:56:27,830
"He wants to win every way."

512
00:56:28,632 --> 00:56:31,897
"He is a jug with no base."

513
00:56:38,642 --> 00:56:41,611
"Beauty has many airs."

514
00:56:53,623 --> 00:56:56,717
"Dear bride, pay attention."

515
00:56:57,027 --> 00:57:00,190
"Meet your elder brother-in-law."

516
00:57:00,464 --> 00:57:03,228
"He's the monarch of
his mother's heart."

517
00:57:03,533 --> 00:57:06,764
"Shyness is his trademark."

518
00:57:26,156 --> 00:57:30,752
"He neither meets my eyes nor
talks to me, behaves like a saint."

519
00:57:36,133 --> 00:57:40,593
"He neither meets my eyes nor
talks to me, behaves like saint."

520
00:57:40,971 --> 00:57:45,237
"Opens his book and
continues revision."

521
00:57:45,575 --> 00:57:50,569
"Prem is in love with Preeti."

522
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:55,978
"Still waters run deep
is true for Prem.

523
00:58:09,733 --> 00:58:16,366
"Why are you so studious?
Try to learn the art of loving."

524
00:58:16,907 --> 00:58:20,070
"As long as you were abroad,
I was in such a state..."

525
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:23,174
"Like a fish out of water."

526
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:30,418
"My beloved is home!"

527
00:58:31,154 --> 00:58:34,214
"Whether studies are
completed or not."

528
00:58:34,491 --> 00:58:39,861
"Get them engaged, dear Mummy."

529
00:58:51,308 --> 00:58:55,039
"Dear bride, hold on
to your heart now."

530
00:58:55,245 --> 00:58:57,736
"It's the turn of your beloved."

531
00:58:58,081 --> 00:59:11,358
"He has no secrets.
His style is different from all."

532
00:59:16,499 --> 00:59:23,302
"He is like an open book."

533
00:59:24,174 --> 00:59:38,350
"There's nobody in the family
who is not proud of him."

534
00:59:39,956 --> 00:59:44,416
"Listen oh bride,
we'll tell you a secret."

535
00:59:50,066 --> 01:00:01,034
"He is the mirror who has
no secrets in it's heart."

536
01:00:14,658 --> 01:00:28,834
"This Uncle of ours is
dearer than the moon to us."

537
01:00:29,739 --> 01:00:34,733
"Don't forget us because
your wife has come."

538
01:00:35,245 --> 01:00:46,782
"Dear uncle, loving uncle."

539
01:01:00,837 --> 01:01:04,204
Come... Come on!

540
01:01:04,607 --> 01:01:07,007
Welcome, to be sister-in-law.

541
01:01:07,344 --> 01:01:10,245
Where were you all this while?
- Blushing away.

542
01:01:10,847 --> 01:01:12,576
Wondering if Prem is here.

543
01:01:12,816 --> 01:01:15,614
Don't be silly. He's hiding
somewhere, scared of you!

544
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:20,355
Aren't you ashamed to
make fun of brother Prem?

545
01:01:20,757 --> 01:01:23,123
You're no less!

546
01:01:25,095 --> 01:01:30,158
All said and done, you really
trapped Prem with the picture joke!

547
01:01:30,567 --> 01:01:32,728
And trapped him so beautifully!

548
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:35,235
I overheard the elders talk.

549
01:01:35,505 --> 01:01:41,102
Tomorrow they've planned a prayer
and Prem's engagement to Preeti!

550
01:01:50,153 --> 01:01:52,348
You're getting engaged today!

551
01:01:52,756 --> 01:01:55,987
Dress up, look smart.
Why the tension, little guy?

552
01:01:59,529 --> 01:02:01,895
Mummy, he is all dressed.

553
01:02:02,766 --> 01:02:05,667
I think your dearest son
has some deep worries.

554
01:02:05,969 --> 01:02:08,529
Stop reading and get up.

555
01:02:10,073 --> 01:02:12,337
Sadhna, put the
necklace round his neck.

556
01:02:12,609 --> 01:02:14,941
It's the right of a sister-in-law.

557
01:02:28,725 --> 01:02:31,421
Now tell us, why are you silent?

558
01:02:32,729 --> 01:02:37,223
What can I say?
- Mother wants to know if you're happy.

559
01:02:38,368 --> 01:02:40,700
You should have asked Preeti once.

560
01:02:41,137 --> 01:02:42,866
Is she happy?

561
01:02:43,673 --> 01:02:45,368
What's the matter?

562
01:02:45,675 --> 01:02:49,111
This is why I'd advised you
to send him to a co-ed school!

563
01:02:49,846 --> 01:02:52,872
Quiet. Sadhna, you convince him.

564
01:02:53,049 --> 01:02:54,380
Silly boy!

565
01:02:54,617 --> 01:02:57,051
Let's go.

566
01:02:59,823 --> 01:03:03,759
A girl talks through her eyes.

567
01:03:05,328 --> 01:03:09,992
Since yesterday ecstasy brims
over from Preeti's eyes.

568
01:03:22,712 --> 01:03:26,978
Lift your eyelids and
look at yourself in the mirror.

569
01:03:31,221 --> 01:03:35,681
You look magical!

570
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:40,525
Praise to Lord Satyanarayan!

571
01:03:43,066 --> 01:03:45,967
Here is the engagement ring.

572
01:03:47,837 --> 01:03:51,034
Prem, slip the ring on her finger.

573
01:03:52,876 --> 01:03:55,003
Wow!

574
01:03:55,778 --> 01:04:00,181
Why are you calling Mummy?
- Get out of her apron strings now!

575
01:04:03,453 --> 01:04:06,354
She is waiting.

576
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:17,889
From today, Preeti is officially ours.

577
01:04:18,401 --> 01:04:20,130
Good, you take over the tension.

578
01:04:20,537 --> 01:04:24,200
I can't guarantee what kind of
housewives, doctors turn out to be.

579
01:04:24,774 --> 01:04:28,574
But they make good daughters.

580
01:04:31,915 --> 01:04:35,908
You've given us too much!
- It's hardly anything.

581
01:04:36,219 --> 01:04:39,416
We're grateful that Anurag
could give us so much time.

582
01:04:39,656 --> 01:04:41,749
We had to come.

583
01:04:42,492 --> 01:04:43,618
I'm asking you for the last time.

584
01:04:43,893 --> 01:04:46,760
Will you come with us
or stay with aunt?

585
01:04:49,532 --> 01:04:52,695
You've wielded magic on them!

586
01:04:52,869 --> 01:04:56,327
That's enough...
- Bye, brother.

587
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:07,345
This is what Rampur
looked like 1 5 years ago.

588
01:05:08,384 --> 01:05:10,944
We'd go to the village
during every vacation.

589
01:05:11,254 --> 01:05:14,087
He was very fond of photography.

590
01:05:17,961 --> 01:05:19,258
Drink your tea!

591
01:05:20,597 --> 01:05:23,225
That's our ancestral home.

592
01:05:26,569 --> 01:05:29,732
Ragu uncle looks so young!

593
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:32,774
He looks after the house.

594
01:05:36,813 --> 01:05:38,610
Good day.

595
01:05:39,782 --> 01:05:43,274
And those are the little kids.

596
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:46,648
Sister-in-law, recognize them.

597
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:48,981
Our train goes...

598
01:05:53,896 --> 01:05:57,332
I'll tell you. This is Vivek.

599
01:05:59,936 --> 01:06:02,166
This is Prem.

600
01:06:02,572 --> 01:06:06,702
Prem, do you know, you've got
thrashed the most from your mother?

601
01:06:06,909 --> 01:06:09,537
He was the most stubborn.

602
01:06:10,046 --> 01:06:12,378
And that is Sangita!

603
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:20,180
That is Vinod!

604
01:06:29,332 --> 01:06:32,062
And who is this, Sapna?

605
01:06:33,102 --> 01:06:34,729
Is that me?

606
01:06:34,871 --> 01:06:36,395
Is that me, grandma?

607
01:06:48,351 --> 01:06:52,048
Sister-in-law, that's
Vivek teaching us.

608
01:07:02,765 --> 01:07:05,165
All together. Great...

609
01:07:05,401 --> 01:07:07,130
Move aside!

610
01:07:09,138 --> 01:07:11,436
Repeat after me.

611
01:07:23,753 --> 01:07:26,187
Look at the lovebirds.

612
01:07:26,422 --> 01:07:29,255
Brother Prem and Preeti.

613
01:07:35,098 --> 01:07:37,589
Who is that?
- You tell me?

614
01:07:37,834 --> 01:07:39,062
It's me!

615
01:08:47,170 --> 01:08:50,606
How they would fight
at every little thing!

616
01:08:55,244 --> 01:08:58,839
And quickly make up. Take a look!

617
01:09:19,702 --> 01:09:21,329
What are you doing here?

618
01:09:21,704 --> 01:09:23,331
Time flies by so fast, isn't it?

619
01:09:25,942 --> 01:09:28,706
How long does it take
for time to go by?

620
01:09:29,312 --> 01:09:33,305
You've just about come and
will leave tomorrow morning.

621
01:09:33,716 --> 01:09:35,843
We meet just once a year.

622
01:09:36,152 --> 01:09:40,680
The rest of the time,
we laugh and even cry.

623
01:09:41,224 --> 01:09:44,421
Is that so?
- I have a request.

624
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:47,561
Don't remove the childhood
love from your heart.

625
01:09:47,864 --> 01:09:51,561
Whenever you think of me,
pray that we meet soon.

626
01:09:51,834 --> 01:09:53,825
Wow! What a thought!

627
01:10:04,647 --> 01:10:07,377
May I ask you something?

628
01:10:07,717 --> 01:10:09,241
You won't be offended?

629
01:10:09,986 --> 01:10:12,978
I'm sitting here only
to talk to you of love.

630
01:10:13,222 --> 01:10:14,951
You might as well say it.

631
01:10:29,805 --> 01:10:34,538
The way you joke with me
from childhood to date...

632
01:10:34,977 --> 01:10:38,743
You talk of this and that.

633
01:10:39,248 --> 01:10:43,344
Is it nothing special
or is there something...?

634
01:10:45,755 --> 01:10:47,450
What do you mean?

635
01:10:49,692 --> 01:10:51,455
Nothing.

636
01:10:55,598 --> 01:10:58,192
What would you say if
I ask you this same question?

637
01:10:58,868 --> 01:11:01,166
I asked you first.

638
01:11:02,505 --> 01:11:04,336
What was the question?

639
01:11:04,574 --> 01:11:06,439
Think of the question all night.

640
01:11:06,676 --> 01:11:09,474
And answer me in the morning.

641
01:11:12,748 --> 01:11:14,215
Listen...

642
01:11:17,486 --> 01:11:20,512
When will it be morning?

643
01:11:29,398 --> 01:11:32,094
Get up...

644
01:12:10,906 --> 01:12:14,501
Sorry, I'm late!

645
01:12:16,746 --> 01:12:20,580
Grandma, you're leaving so early?
Stay for a while.

646
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:23,546
Unlike you, the train is bang
on time, not a minute late.

647
01:12:28,257 --> 01:12:30,782
I'll go and drop them to the station.

648
01:12:31,027 --> 01:12:33,495
You keep sleeping. Brother
and I are going. Grandma...

649
01:12:38,868 --> 01:12:40,233
Grandma...

650
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,926
Papa is absolutely right.

651
01:13:07,163 --> 01:13:10,621
One must get up early or
half the jobs get left undone.

652
01:13:10,933 --> 01:13:12,298
I accept that.

653
01:13:13,736 --> 01:13:16,830
If you've understood that,
hear this too...

654
01:13:17,106 --> 01:13:20,633
The jobs not done today
will be completed tomorrow.

655
01:13:20,843 --> 01:13:24,006
Each morning gets a ray
of sunshine when it comes.

656
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:26,373
I must note this down.

657
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:30,946
Prem, show the bride the office.

658
01:13:36,058 --> 01:13:38,083
Come on.

659
01:13:38,427 --> 01:13:41,988
This room is of us brothers.
- That's Vivek's table.

660
01:13:42,164 --> 01:13:45,031
That is Prem's and
this is Vinod's.

661
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:54,408
Sit here, on big boss Vivek's chair.

662
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:57,474
What will you have?
- Get some juice...

663
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,375
Let's have a party!

664
01:13:59,815 --> 01:14:03,615
Let Vivek come. We have to
discuss something important.

665
01:14:05,254 --> 01:14:07,688
I'll just...
- Come on, brother!

666
01:14:11,026 --> 01:14:13,517
Yes, what seems to be the problem?

667
01:14:13,763 --> 01:14:17,722
You've barely been married for
2 days and you've joined work!

668
01:14:18,434 --> 01:14:21,460
People generally go out
after their wedding.

669
01:14:21,704 --> 01:14:24,298
Where will you take your
wife for your honeymoon?

670
01:14:28,144 --> 01:14:32,513
One minute. Wherever we go,
we'll all go together.

671
01:14:32,982 --> 01:14:36,315
How crazy! What will the
others do on your honeymoon?

672
01:14:36,619 --> 01:14:38,519
How else can we all be together?

673
01:14:38,888 --> 01:14:40,685
If you agree,
we'll make a program or...

674
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:42,687
No, don't cancel it!

675
01:14:43,492 --> 01:14:46,950
We're not tagging along.
- Yes, he's taking us!

676
01:14:47,596 --> 01:14:49,427
That's good. All of you
children must go out.

677
01:14:49,765 --> 01:14:51,096
You too, Preeti.

678
01:14:53,736 --> 01:14:56,466
What do you say?

679
01:14:56,739 --> 01:14:59,207
At least say, yes!

680
01:15:01,544 --> 01:15:03,478
You're the only one who won't come.
- Why?

681
01:15:03,712 --> 01:15:05,942
He hasn't gone to his shop
for the past three weeks.

682
01:15:06,182 --> 01:15:07,581
Forget it!

683
01:15:07,817 --> 01:15:10,377
You've forgotten you're going
on a tour with the band.

684
01:15:10,586 --> 01:15:12,952
Is he a friend or my enemy?

685
01:15:14,757 --> 01:15:17,351
All right, this time
you win and I lose.

686
01:15:17,593 --> 01:15:20,391
Tell me where you want to go.
I'll get the tickets.

687
01:15:20,596 --> 01:15:25,397
Tell us!
- Just a minute. She'll tell us.

688
01:15:27,036 --> 01:15:29,527
Shall we go to Rampur?

689
01:15:34,210 --> 01:15:37,008
Say that once again.

690
01:16:43,846 --> 01:16:46,815
"Great are the days of vacations."

691
01:16:47,383 --> 01:16:51,581
"Wish you're always with me."

692
01:16:51,987 --> 01:16:55,150
"Turm into kids with the kids."

693
01:16:55,591 --> 01:16:59,925
"Let's play and gamble with them."

694
01:17:00,696 --> 01:17:06,965
"Turn into a cloud or
a bird and fly away."

695
01:17:07,202 --> 01:17:09,136
"That's a great feeling!"

696
01:17:56,385 --> 01:17:59,684
"Let's go to the
lanes of our village."

697
01:17:59,955 --> 01:18:03,948
"The heart is lost in the
memories of childhood."

698
01:18:04,326 --> 01:18:07,625
"Holding the arms of her brothers..."

699
01:18:07,896 --> 01:18:12,424
"Their sister will dance once again."

700
01:18:12,968 --> 01:18:16,904
"The swings of monsoon,
the courtyard of her Dad..."

701
01:18:17,206 --> 01:18:20,539
"...She'll see them again."

702
01:19:09,858 --> 01:19:17,663
"Listen to what the cool wind
quietly comes and tells us."

703
01:19:18,033 --> 01:19:21,332
"We are close to our destination."

704
01:19:21,703 --> 01:19:26,072
"The clouds ask us to gather joys."

705
01:19:26,608 --> 01:19:30,601
"Conceal from all eyes,
hide in your heart..."

706
01:19:30,813 --> 01:19:33,373
"Spin dreams."

707
01:20:27,536 --> 01:20:30,130
Welcome, Vivek.

708
01:20:32,274 --> 01:20:34,208
We've been waiting for you
since this morning.

709
01:20:34,409 --> 01:20:35,774
Really?

710
01:20:38,013 --> 01:20:40,004
We're waiting to welcome you
with the flowers for ages...

711
01:20:40,349 --> 01:20:42,112
Honest?
- Absolutely!

712
01:20:46,989 --> 01:20:51,756
All the way here, I had the answer
to your question memorized in my heart.

713
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:56,090
I didn't know, I wouldn't
need to say a single word.

714
01:20:57,766 --> 01:21:01,668
Both of us have been
tied together in a bond.

715
01:21:02,171 --> 01:21:05,106
Where can you go?

716
01:21:12,983 --> 01:21:16,282
Come on, kids.
Have some fresh guavas!

717
01:21:20,991 --> 01:21:26,623
You'll find a lot of Rajasthani
color in our attire and speech.

718
01:21:27,431 --> 01:21:32,027
My heart is overjoyed to see you.

719
01:21:33,070 --> 01:21:35,971
What are you explaining to her?

720
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:38,935
She has lived abroad.

721
01:21:39,276 --> 01:21:41,767
I'm introducing her to the village.

722
01:21:43,146 --> 01:21:47,606
I've heard that people in
the cities are so busy...

723
01:21:47,851 --> 01:21:51,810
They don't have time
to eat meals in peace.

724
01:21:53,290 --> 01:21:56,987
That is why people from cities
come to the village for holidays.

725
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,954
They get peace of mind here.

726
01:22:00,230 --> 01:22:03,393
Grandma, we've left
those lanes far behind.

727
01:22:07,337 --> 01:22:10,329
But excuse me, what's
left in this village?

728
01:22:10,741 --> 01:22:13,608
Neither planes come
here nor mobile phones.

729
01:22:13,944 --> 01:22:15,536
There's a shortage of electricity!

730
01:22:15,846 --> 01:22:19,247
We've left the electricity way behind.

731
01:22:20,817 --> 01:22:23,251
We're going for a walk.

732
01:22:24,855 --> 01:22:26,482
Coming.

733
01:22:27,424 --> 01:22:29,688
Come on.
- You go ahead.

734
01:22:29,926 --> 01:22:32,486
I'll help the ladies in the kitchen.

735
01:22:35,532 --> 01:22:37,659
You too were supposed
to go for the walk.

736
01:22:37,901 --> 01:22:40,301
Who said?
- You said so a while ago.

737
01:22:40,604 --> 01:22:43,368
You've reformed...
- No...

738
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:45,708
Shall we...?

739
01:22:46,610 --> 01:22:48,373
Come on!

740
01:22:49,913 --> 01:22:53,713
Brother! Elder brother!

741
01:22:54,351 --> 01:22:57,616
We came for a walk
but here we're running!

742
01:22:57,854 --> 01:22:59,685
Shall we return?
- Just a little further.

743
01:22:59,956 --> 01:23:02,049
I want to show Prem how far
the factory has progressed.

744
01:23:03,059 --> 01:23:04,959
Prem, come on.

745
01:23:05,195 --> 01:23:06,856
Come on.

746
01:23:34,891 --> 01:23:36,483
This is the site.

747
01:23:36,660 --> 01:23:39,356
Production will begin in a few months.

748
01:23:41,364 --> 01:23:45,266
Can we check the progress of the
factory from close quarters later?

749
01:23:45,535 --> 01:23:48,060
I'm feeling terribly cold!

750
01:23:48,405 --> 01:23:51,670
Okay, we'll sit here for sometime.

751
01:23:53,076 --> 01:23:57,638
Won't Papa be terribly happy
when the factory is operational.

752
01:23:59,449 --> 01:24:01,212
What are you thinking of?

753
01:24:01,418 --> 01:24:05,286
Nothing.
- I think he's starving.

754
01:24:06,456 --> 01:24:09,391
Go for a run. I have to
talk to Prem about something.

755
01:24:09,693 --> 01:24:12,321
Talk to him at home.
After breakfast.

756
01:24:14,698 --> 01:24:19,726
Which way do I go? Not this way
it's all uphill.

757
01:24:22,138 --> 01:24:23,730
What's the matter?

758
01:24:24,608 --> 01:24:26,303
Brother...

759
01:24:26,710 --> 01:24:30,976
When you see poverty and
difficulties around you...

760
01:24:31,414 --> 01:24:34,440
Helplessness writ large
on the faces of people.

761
01:24:34,718 --> 01:24:37,744
Don't you then feel...

762
01:24:38,188 --> 01:24:42,147
What is all this for?

763
01:24:43,026 --> 01:24:46,393
Sometimes I feel my education,
my Masters Degree...

764
01:24:49,532 --> 01:24:51,329
Everything seems futile.

765
01:24:51,501 --> 01:24:54,493
We can't run away from the truth.

766
01:24:54,771 --> 01:24:58,366
Will your thinking
diminish somebody's sorrow?

767
01:24:58,975 --> 01:25:01,466
If you want to share their sorrow...

768
01:25:01,912 --> 01:25:05,814
Do something that will
bring joy to their lives.

769
01:25:07,017 --> 01:25:10,418
Look at this plant.
When it is operational...

770
01:25:10,887 --> 01:25:13,412
This place will always have power.

771
01:25:14,124 --> 01:25:17,093
This is Papa's dream.
For the progress of this village.

772
01:25:18,328 --> 01:25:22,731
For the future of those kids
who will be me and you tomorrow.

773
01:25:27,337 --> 01:25:30,170
You have a lot to do in life.

774
01:25:30,373 --> 01:25:34,332
Study hard. At this point
this is your only duty.

775
01:25:34,711 --> 01:25:37,908
Yes, you do have another duty.

776
01:25:38,915 --> 01:25:40,678
Towards Preeti.

777
01:25:42,686 --> 01:25:46,452
A girl gives up everything for you.

778
01:25:47,657 --> 01:25:50,455
She behaves the way you'd want her to.

779
01:25:52,395 --> 01:25:55,489
In return, she only
asks for a little love.

780
01:25:56,299 --> 01:25:58,767
I know you do lover her a lot.

781
01:25:59,669 --> 01:26:03,435
But you have to express
the love in your heart.

782
01:26:04,074 --> 01:26:05,769
Bring the words in
your heart to your lips.

783
01:26:06,076 --> 01:26:10,410
And you'll see how she blooms.

784
01:26:16,319 --> 01:26:18,753
Have you guys finished talking?
- Yes.

785
01:26:19,622 --> 01:26:22,147
Anything serious?

786
01:26:22,792 --> 01:26:25,727
I'll talk to you when the time comes

787
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:33,135
You've made excellent
dumplings, sister-in-law!

788
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:37,767
We made them. I had no idea
you could cook so well.

789
01:26:39,175 --> 01:26:42,804
Prem, now taste this
and tell us how it is.

790
01:26:43,079 --> 01:26:44,944
No! Please...

791
01:26:45,148 --> 01:26:47,378
What's the matter?

792
01:26:49,185 --> 01:26:54,248
When we insisted, for the first
time, she made Prem's favorite sweet.

793
01:26:54,891 --> 01:26:56,722
And she's feeling shy to serve it.

794
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:59,187
She thinks it's not good enough.

795
01:26:59,496 --> 01:27:03,057
Prem will certify whether
it's good or not. Serve him.

796
01:27:04,901 --> 01:27:07,131
Just a second.

797
01:27:07,570 --> 01:27:09,128
The video too is ready.

798
01:27:20,183 --> 01:27:22,981
How is it?
- Good.

799
01:27:23,153 --> 01:27:24,814
Good or very good?

800
01:27:25,255 --> 01:27:27,416
Very good.
- Then take some more.

801
01:27:28,658 --> 01:27:32,492
I will.
- Here you are!

802
01:27:32,762 --> 01:27:35,629
Brother's face is
as red as the sweet!

803
01:27:42,572 --> 01:27:45,598
I am feeling shy!

804
01:27:45,842 --> 01:27:49,903
Don't be so conscious. I'm
taking your photo with them.

805
01:27:50,747 --> 01:27:53,307
Speak in our tongue.

806
01:27:59,756 --> 01:28:02,486
Prem, put the picnic bags in the bus.

807
01:28:23,746 --> 01:28:25,646
The sweet dish was very good.

808
01:28:26,883 --> 01:28:30,751
I was making it for the first time
I feared whether you'd like it.

809
01:28:35,225 --> 01:28:39,059
You must make it again.

810
01:29:13,429 --> 01:29:16,091
Stop riding and come here.

811
01:29:16,366 --> 01:29:20,200
We're discussing the love life
of a king who lived 1000 years ago.

812
01:29:23,825 --> 01:29:26,123
Look at that...
- So how many queens did he have?

813
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:29,429
100. Let's go to the umbrella.

814
01:29:30,498 --> 01:29:33,365
See how lucky he was!

815
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:35,298
I swear! Had it been me...

816
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:47,010
And this is the palace of the queens.

817
01:29:47,282 --> 01:29:50,615
They say, the youngest queen
was the most beautiful one!

818
01:29:50,952 --> 01:29:53,819
She's sing in her melodious
voice among her friends.

819
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:56,353
And dance too.

820
01:29:59,861 --> 01:30:02,955
Hearing the sound of their
music and their anklets...

821
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:06,462
Hundreds of peacocks
would dance here with them.

822
01:30:06,635 --> 01:30:08,466
Do they still come here?

823
01:30:08,703 --> 01:30:10,603
The sky is overcast with clouds.

824
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:13,466
Beautiful ladies stand before us.

825
01:30:14,042 --> 01:30:16,533
How can the poor peacocks escape?

826
01:30:18,046 --> 01:30:19,980
Continue the romance.

827
01:30:22,851 --> 01:30:24,842
Look at that.

828
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,953
What is it? Peacock?
- No, elephants.

829
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:30,353
Elephant?

830
01:30:35,764 --> 01:30:38,164
Prem is a different kettle of fish.

831
01:30:38,366 --> 01:30:40,095
Sometimes he rides horses.
Otherwise he gets elephants.

832
01:30:41,069 --> 01:30:44,630
Come, I'll take you
for an elephant ride.

833
01:30:50,045 --> 01:30:51,307
Come on, kids.

834
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:55,844
- Come here sister-in-law.
- I'm going ahead.

835
01:30:56,217 --> 01:30:57,775
Preeti, sit here.

836
01:30:58,186 --> 01:31:01,349
Have fun! Give her a hand.

837
01:31:10,665 --> 01:31:12,132
Everybody be seated.

838
01:31:12,534 --> 01:31:14,502
Sit down.

839
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:20,464
Where do I go?

840
01:31:20,709 --> 01:31:23,678
- Come here.
- Everybody hold hands.

841
01:31:24,112 --> 01:31:27,980
Take me carefully.
I mustn't fall down.

842
01:31:28,183 --> 01:31:29,946
I haven't even got engaged.

843
01:31:32,654 --> 01:31:37,353
My friend, the elephant.
Praise be Lord Ganesha.

844
01:32:14,429 --> 01:32:16,863
Look at the peacock!

845
01:32:21,136 --> 01:32:23,661
- Where is it?
- There!

846
01:32:30,311 --> 01:32:32,973
How beautiful!

847
01:32:33,248 --> 01:32:36,775
Yes, truly beautiful!

848
01:32:41,322 --> 01:32:43,882
"My heart..."

849
01:32:44,092 --> 01:32:48,324
"Peacock dance in my heart."

850
01:32:49,964 --> 01:32:55,425
"The black bee screeches
and my heart blooms."

851
01:32:56,004 --> 01:33:00,998
"Has the season changed or the
scenario or simply my perspective?"

852
01:33:01,543 --> 01:33:06,276
"Peacock dance in my heart."

853
01:33:06,948 --> 01:33:12,648
"The black bee screeches
and my heart blooms."

854
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:20,392
"Has the season changed or
the scenario or my perspective?"

855
01:34:04,205 --> 01:34:21,021
"You are a newly wed bride.
You reflect radiant love."

856
01:34:21,356 --> 01:34:27,090
"Henna on your hands and kohl in
eyes brings a sparkle to my life."

857
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:32,065
"You came as the answer
to my questions, my love."

858
01:34:32,867 --> 01:34:40,569
"Peacocks dance in my heart."

859
01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:46,677
"We're tied in such a bond
I've madly fallen in love."

860
01:34:47,215 --> 01:34:53,552
"Has the season changed or the
scenario or simply my perspective?"

861
01:35:50,245 --> 01:36:06,651
"The season of love is here.
It has sprung love everywhere."

862
01:36:07,195 --> 01:36:12,997
"The secret that was in my heart
has finally come to my lips."

863
01:36:13,401 --> 01:36:18,532
"I'll install you in my heart and
take you to the kingdom of love."

864
01:36:18,806 --> 01:36:26,235
"Peacocks dance in my heart."

865
01:36:27,115 --> 01:36:32,849
"Take me wherever you please,
I'll follow you, my dearest."

866
01:36:33,154 --> 01:36:38,990
"Has the season changed or the
scenario or simply my perspective?

867
01:37:58,773 --> 01:38:15,316
"The procession of the moon and
stars brought this glorious moment."

868
01:38:15,790 --> 01:38:21,285
"What a great moment!
The queen of my dreams is with me."

869
01:38:21,896 --> 01:38:27,732
"You troubled me so much.
Today I won't let go your arm."

870
01:38:53,194 --> 01:38:55,128
The moon light night is beautiful!

871
01:38:55,396 --> 01:38:58,695
It's bright outside. Only
we don't have current.

872
01:38:59,033 --> 01:39:01,160
How can that be?

873
01:39:01,869 --> 01:39:03,268
I'll take a look.

874
01:40:10,471 --> 01:40:11,733
The current is back?

875
01:40:11,906 --> 01:40:13,430
What do you think?

876
01:40:15,476 --> 01:40:18,274
I'll just be back.

877
01:40:39,634 --> 01:40:41,727
Welcome!

878
01:40:45,973 --> 01:40:49,841
My dear fellow, congratulations
on your daughter's engagement.

879
01:40:53,548 --> 01:40:55,982
What are you doing?

880
01:40:56,717 --> 01:41:00,551
We've come to ask you
for your child's hand.

881
01:41:02,990 --> 01:41:05,288
Mummy and Papa are here.

882
01:41:05,593 --> 01:41:08,027
- They're asking for you.
- I won't go!

883
01:41:08,195 --> 01:41:11,426
Strange! You're getting
engaged today and look at you.

884
01:41:11,666 --> 01:41:14,533
Tease me, go on.

885
01:41:14,902 --> 01:41:18,998
You're the one who spread
the tale of the fuse off!

886
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,035
Everyone is laughing!

887
01:41:22,944 --> 01:41:24,639
What will Mummy and Papa think?

888
01:41:24,979 --> 01:41:29,473
Mummy was really mad at you. Said
nobody in the family behaved like you!

889
01:41:30,151 --> 01:41:31,345
I'm dead!

890
01:41:32,486 --> 01:41:35,421
- I'll say it was your ideal.
- Want to kill me?

891
01:41:37,658 --> 01:41:40,718
Tell them the light
went off by chance.

892
01:41:42,997 --> 01:41:45,898
Please, my Moms!

893
01:41:47,201 --> 01:41:48,998
Come on.

894
01:41:50,638 --> 01:41:52,401
Good Lord!

895
01:42:04,585 --> 01:42:08,954
- The light went off by chance.
- Really? - It wasn't my fault.

896
01:42:09,624 --> 01:42:11,182
Isn't it?

897
01:42:13,461 --> 01:42:15,986
Brother and his wife are to be blamed.

898
01:42:16,230 --> 01:42:19,165
They said, get engaged.
So I said, all right.

899
01:42:19,767 --> 01:42:21,997
- It finishes one job.
- Oh, I see.

900
01:42:23,904 --> 01:42:25,201
Come on, Mummy.

901
01:42:32,413 --> 01:42:35,541
"Mother Yashodha..."

902
01:42:36,417 --> 01:42:39,318
"This son of yours..."

903
01:42:44,458 --> 01:42:48,451
"Mother Yashodha, this son of yours..."

904
01:42:48,829 --> 01:42:52,595
"Holds my arms at the riverbank."

905
01:42:52,867 --> 01:42:56,701
"He troubles me a lot,
keeps fighting with me."

906
01:42:58,539 --> 01:43:09,643
"I was spared thanks to Lord Rama."

907
01:43:11,185 --> 01:43:15,246
"Mother Yoshodha, this son of yours..."

908
01:43:15,589 --> 01:43:18,922
"holds my arms at the river bank."

909
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:23,390
"He troubles me a lot,
he keeps fighting with me."

910
01:43:25,099 --> 01:43:36,533
"I was spared thanks to Lord Rama."

911
01:44:10,745 --> 01:44:17,150
"In the streets of Gokul,
on the banks of the Jamuna."

912
01:44:17,384 --> 01:44:22,515
"He shyly throws pebbles at me."

913
01:44:25,059 --> 01:44:30,827
"He's so mischievous but
his countenance innocent."

914
01:44:31,098 --> 01:44:36,798
"He drenches my blouse
when Holi comes by."

915
01:44:37,705 --> 01:44:40,538
"He won't leave my arm."

916
01:44:41,075 --> 01:44:44,511
"He twists my wrists."

917
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:46,836
"He won't leave my arm."

918
01:44:47,081 --> 01:44:49,311
"He twists my wrists."

919
01:44:49,550 --> 01:44:53,179
"I fall at his feet yet
he won't leave me in peace."

920
01:44:53,621 --> 01:44:57,022
"He traps me with his sweet words."

921
01:45:48,909 --> 01:45:54,643
"Each time Mohan plays the flute..."

922
01:45:55,182 --> 01:46:00,484
"My anklets start to
dance on their own."

923
01:46:03,490 --> 01:46:08,393
"When he teases me with his eyes..."

924
01:46:09,196 --> 01:46:14,793
"The damsel foolishly in love
holds on to heart for dear life."

925
01:46:15,469 --> 01:46:18,597
"She has lost her heart."

926
01:46:19,473 --> 01:46:23,341
"She has lost her sleep."

927
01:46:23,944 --> 01:46:25,377
"She has lost her heart."

928
01:46:25,613 --> 01:46:27,478
"She has lost her sleep."

929
01:46:27,715 --> 01:46:31,583
"She couldn't do what
she set out to do."

930
01:46:31,886 --> 01:46:36,289
"With great difficulty,
she controlled her heart."

931
01:46:37,458 --> 01:46:48,767
"Thanks to Lord Rama"

932
01:47:31,312 --> 01:47:36,249
"The Kanha of Gokul
lives in every heart."

933
01:47:37,351 --> 01:47:42,186
"Fortunate am I that I found him."

934
01:47:45,492 --> 01:47:51,089
"Agreed that he belongs to all."

935
01:47:51,632 --> 01:47:57,161
"Yet he will always be yours, mother."

936
01:47:57,838 --> 01:48:01,171
"He's a beloved."

937
01:48:01,742 --> 01:48:05,405
"You've given him to us."

938
01:48:05,913 --> 01:48:07,312
"He's a beloved."

939
01:48:07,581 --> 01:48:09,708
"You've given him to us."

940
01:48:09,984 --> 01:48:13,886
"You've taken us into your
shield of maternal love."

941
01:48:14,221 --> 01:48:18,487
"Oh mother, we have
to live at your feet."

942
01:48:19,593 --> 01:48:31,596
"Thanks to Lord Rama's kindness."

943
01:48:47,021 --> 01:48:48,249
Come here.

944
01:48:49,289 --> 01:48:51,723
Why are you sitting there
with the old guys? Come here.

945
01:48:53,327 --> 01:48:55,090
Only waiting for you.

946
01:49:14,281 --> 01:49:17,580
You will first hava a son
followed by a daughter.

947
01:49:20,521 --> 01:49:21,920
What formula is this?

948
01:49:22,189 --> 01:49:24,851
It's simple. If the ring is
straight, it will be a son.

949
01:49:25,159 --> 01:49:26,683
If it spins, it will be a girl.

950
01:49:26,927 --> 01:49:29,191
And if it doesn't spin, full stop.

951
01:49:30,197 --> 01:49:32,597
What a scientific method!

952
01:49:33,033 --> 01:49:37,663
He's fond of reading from various
sources and using it to impress.

953
01:49:38,038 --> 01:49:41,439
Man should view every new
thing with curiosity.

954
01:49:42,142 --> 01:49:43,609
And it was true in our case.

955
01:49:45,145 --> 01:49:47,113
Preeti, now it's your turn.

956
01:49:47,948 --> 01:49:49,540
Come on, show your hand.

957
01:49:49,783 --> 01:49:51,774
Now everybody is interested.

958
01:50:01,161 --> 01:50:05,461
You'll just have a
sweet little boy. Happy?

959
01:50:16,143 --> 01:50:19,601
Yes, now it's your turn.

960
01:50:25,252 --> 01:50:27,277
Son...

961
01:50:29,523 --> 01:50:32,287
Daughter.

962
01:50:34,261 --> 01:50:37,230
Son. Daughter.

963
01:50:37,664 --> 01:50:40,030
Son. Daughter.

964
01:50:40,801 --> 01:50:45,261
Son. Daughter.
Son. Daughter...

965
01:50:47,875 --> 01:50:51,106
I've had it!

966
01:50:51,845 --> 01:50:54,439
I was pulling your leg.

967
01:51:23,944 --> 01:51:26,276
- Give me your hand.
- I won't.

968
01:51:26,413 --> 01:51:29,211
- Why? - What's this?
Do you have to return today?

969
01:51:29,383 --> 01:51:34,616
What has cropped up that
Anurag has called you today?

970
01:51:36,190 --> 01:51:39,591
It must be important or
brother wouldn't have called.

971
01:51:40,093 --> 01:51:43,529
Today we were planning a
picnic to the factory site.

972
01:51:43,797 --> 01:51:45,765
We won't enjoy without the kids.

973
01:51:45,999 --> 01:51:50,402
We'll plan another trip after
Prem and Vinod get married.

974
01:51:50,704 --> 01:51:52,228
Papa, we'll all go together.

975
01:51:52,439 --> 01:51:56,102
By then the seat next
to your should be full.

976
01:51:57,177 --> 01:52:00,943
I've fixed my program
with sister-in-law.

977
01:52:01,281 --> 01:52:05,377
When they will be three,
we will be two.

978
01:52:07,721 --> 01:52:09,655
We'll take leave.

979
01:52:10,624 --> 01:52:12,148
It's time.

980
01:52:21,235 --> 01:52:25,638
We didn't realize how these days
flew by in games and laughter.

981
01:52:32,279 --> 01:52:38,741
30 years ago, I left
this village with a dream.

982
01:52:39,620 --> 01:52:43,386
I wanted to do something so that
the villagers wouldn't have to...

983
01:52:43,857 --> 01:52:48,453
...leave their families
and go far for work.

984
01:52:49,096 --> 01:52:52,190
Today I see that dream taking shape.

985
01:52:53,834 --> 01:52:57,497
Brother and Bhaijaan are waiting
for us at the site. We'll go there.

986
01:53:00,374 --> 01:53:05,778
- Let's go to work.
- Shall we stay here?

987
01:53:14,087 --> 01:53:17,420
We're all waiting for the
factory to be inaugurated.

988
01:53:17,724 --> 01:53:22,423
The moment the plant is inaugurated
we'll hear the wedding bells.

989
01:53:22,729 --> 01:53:25,493
The date for the wedding
matches this perfectly.

990
01:53:26,867 --> 01:53:29,893
Now we're just waiting
for that auspicious date.

991
01:53:30,203 --> 01:53:33,764
And I hand over the business
to my sons and be carefree.

992
01:53:34,241 --> 01:53:43,445
I've decided to hand charge of the
company, the directorship to Vivek.

993
01:53:45,519 --> 01:53:47,214
I'd made her a promise.

994
01:53:47,721 --> 01:53:52,715
Once our sons are married,
all my time will be hers.

995
01:53:53,193 --> 01:53:56,185
So the daily appointments
dairy will be with her?

996
01:53:57,164 --> 01:54:00,429
You will be burdening Vivek
with a huge responsibility.

997
01:54:00,801 --> 01:54:03,634
He deserves it every way.

998
01:54:05,906 --> 01:54:08,568
Wow! What news!

999
01:54:08,942 --> 01:54:10,534
Congratulations!

1000
01:54:10,877 --> 01:54:13,368
You don't understand anything.!

1001
01:54:13,747 --> 01:54:16,511
If Vivek becomes the
company managing director...

1002
01:54:16,750 --> 01:54:19,651
Adarsh will be one up on us!

1003
01:54:20,187 --> 01:54:24,021
- That is true.
- What will our son-in-law have?

1004
01:54:24,458 --> 01:54:27,450
They will always have to obey Vivek.

1005
01:54:27,928 --> 01:54:31,489
They will have to beg
him for every little thing!

1006
01:54:31,898 --> 01:54:34,458
What shame in asking
your elder brother?

1007
01:54:35,001 --> 01:54:41,133
Power can corrupt. Family
relations are forgotten.

1008
01:54:41,908 --> 01:54:44,741
This concerns our daughters too.

1009
01:54:45,512 --> 01:54:48,447
You are very good friends.

1010
01:54:48,849 --> 01:54:50,976
Do something and stop
this from happening.

1011
01:54:52,085 --> 01:54:54,485
Take the wife into confidence.

1012
01:54:54,755 --> 01:54:58,156
- Why? - The minds of women
work better in this regard.

1013
01:54:58,492 --> 01:55:00,960
Don't worry. Follow me.

1014
01:55:01,428 --> 01:55:07,663
We don't understand your
making Vivek the MD.

1015
01:55:08,201 --> 01:55:10,601
- Why?
- Is that fair to us?

1016
01:55:12,038 --> 01:55:13,665
With Vinod and Prem?

1017
01:55:14,074 --> 01:55:16,065
Such an important announcement
and you simply said it.

1018
01:55:16,343 --> 01:55:18,004
No party, no celebration.

1019
01:55:22,783 --> 01:55:25,843
Dharmraj is most upset about this.

1020
01:55:26,453 --> 01:55:29,650
That is why he has decided that
tomorrow before we leave for town...

1021
01:55:29,890 --> 01:55:34,156
He will distribute Jaipur
sweetmeats to the village!

1022
01:55:34,461 --> 01:55:36,156
Why did you have to do this?

1023
01:55:46,506 --> 01:55:49,031
May the Lord always be kind to you.

1024
01:55:50,177 --> 01:55:53,476
My good fellow, everybody
is blessing you for this!

1025
01:55:56,550 --> 01:55:59,348
All of you are leaving.

1026
01:55:59,719 --> 01:56:01,983
We will be left alone.

1027
01:56:02,255 --> 01:56:04,849
That is why we leave Sapna with you.

1028
01:56:05,258 --> 01:56:08,022
Or we'd take her along.

1029
01:56:08,695 --> 01:56:11,186
Next time, I'll bring him along.

1030
01:56:11,465 --> 01:56:13,729
He'll stay here for a few
days to learn the work.

1031
01:56:14,067 --> 01:56:17,628
I'll come here to work
but not make small talk.

1032
01:56:18,371 --> 01:56:20,236
If I get the time...

1033
01:56:23,310 --> 01:56:25,642
When do you leave for
your studies abroad?

1034
01:56:25,912 --> 01:56:27,709
Tomorrow night.

1035
01:56:36,957 --> 01:56:40,393
Here are the sweets and savories.
Keep them in the bag.

1036
01:56:44,831 --> 01:56:46,890
I didn't make them.

1037
01:56:49,069 --> 01:56:51,060
Did you...?

1038
01:56:55,408 --> 01:56:59,367
Preeti made them. Don't you dare
distribute them amongest friends!

1039
01:57:01,515 --> 01:57:02,880
When will you return?

1040
01:57:04,084 --> 01:57:06,109
How can I say?

1041
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:08,351
Only till the exams.

1042
01:57:08,555 --> 01:57:10,147
Then he'll be with you.

1043
01:57:10,624 --> 01:57:15,527
Write a love letter to mother
everyday instead of to Preeti.

1044
01:57:15,929 --> 01:57:18,727
- You spoke again!
- The flight is on time. Hurry up.

1045
01:57:19,466 --> 01:57:22,333
You come here, I'll show you!

1046
01:57:26,706 --> 01:57:29,266
Shall we leave?

1047
01:57:36,716 --> 01:57:38,980
You may stay.

1048
01:57:50,897 --> 01:57:52,865
This is very good.

1049
01:57:53,166 --> 01:57:56,431
Going on a world trip with your wife.

1050
01:57:56,670 --> 01:57:59,366
You'll have Prem's
company on the flight.

1051
01:57:59,573 --> 01:58:02,201
You're keeping the promise
you gave your wife.

1052
01:58:02,475 --> 01:58:04,534
And I'm keeping mine.

1053
01:58:07,447 --> 01:58:11,281
Leave this veil behind for some days.

1054
01:58:11,685 --> 01:58:14,552
She'll wear jeans abroad.

1055
01:58:34,541 --> 01:58:38,705
Come here. Sit with Papa today.

1056
01:58:41,181 --> 01:58:43,877
I had to make an important phone call.

1057
01:58:45,251 --> 01:58:49,415
Try to understand the important
phone call after engagement!

1058
01:58:50,724 --> 01:58:53,124
This will be a daily occurrence.

1059
01:58:53,793 --> 01:58:57,024
Did you decide the
color for your room?

1060
01:58:59,065 --> 01:59:01,829
Prem, let us know your choice too.

1061
01:59:02,035 --> 01:59:04,595
I have to make rooms for both
of you before your marriages.

1062
01:59:04,871 --> 01:59:08,272
Vinod has given me a long list.
You too must tell me.

1063
01:59:09,209 --> 01:59:12,474
What can I say? As Preeti wishes.

1064
01:59:12,912 --> 01:59:16,848
He has really changed.

1065
01:59:17,317 --> 01:59:22,016
I'll just say this. All three boys
should have similar rooms.

1066
01:59:22,455 --> 01:59:26,983
They are the same. Vivek's is up
stairs and Prem and Vinod are down.

1067
01:59:27,227 --> 01:59:28,888
They too should have rooms upstairs.

1068
01:59:29,129 --> 01:59:30,756
Why shouldn't they get a garden view?

1069
01:59:31,031 --> 01:59:37,129
Later these are the issues that
will create fights between them.

1070
01:59:41,374 --> 01:59:44,104
She's laughing.

1071
01:59:45,278 --> 01:59:49,044
- Uncle is here.
- Good day to you.

1072
01:59:49,282 --> 01:59:51,375
Welcome.

1073
01:59:51,918 --> 01:59:53,715
Since when do you have this ailment?

1074
01:59:54,020 --> 01:59:58,480
Excuse me, I think I'm
going through a bad phase.

1075
01:59:58,658 --> 02:00:00,717
Get them in.

1076
02:00:01,161 --> 02:00:04,528
I've brought some sweets
for Janmashtami, from Agra.

1077
02:00:04,731 --> 02:00:06,665
Pass them here!

1078
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:11,562
You are our favorite
relative from all the three!

1079
02:00:14,407 --> 02:00:17,035
Call Papa in the office
and tell him brother is here.

1080
02:00:17,310 --> 02:00:19,574
Don't disturb him in work.

1081
02:00:19,779 --> 02:00:23,840
I've come to meet sister.

1082
02:00:26,753 --> 02:00:28,812
First of all do something for us.

1083
02:00:34,260 --> 02:00:38,060
What can I say in family matters?

1084
02:00:38,298 --> 02:00:40,198
You have all the rights.

1085
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:43,267
- You're giving your daughter!
- Yes. That's right.

1086
02:00:43,503 --> 02:00:45,994
You get after every little thing!

1087
02:00:47,540 --> 02:00:51,442
Excuse me.

1088
02:00:57,117 --> 02:00:59,915
Sangita here.

1089
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:02,251
I've been thinking
of you since morning.

1090
02:01:02,522 --> 02:01:05,923
- How are the kids?
- All fine.

1091
02:01:08,194 --> 02:01:10,458
Are you feeling all right?

1092
02:01:10,697 --> 02:01:14,656
- Yes, is Vivek home?
- He's in the office.

1093
02:01:14,901 --> 02:01:17,802
I'll talk to him there.

1094
02:01:18,238 --> 02:01:22,732
Nothing special. Bye.

1095
02:01:29,482 --> 02:01:34,977
Don't worry. Give the line to Anand.

1096
02:01:36,356 --> 02:01:41,885
Something important cropped up.
We'll discuss this later.

1097
02:01:45,265 --> 02:01:51,033
I don't know what exactly happened
between Anand and Anurag.

1098
02:01:51,738 --> 02:01:55,572
But Sangita and Anand
are quite worried.

1099
02:01:56,676 --> 02:01:58,644
They have called me there.

1100
02:02:13,526 --> 02:02:16,393
Why are you crying?

1101
02:02:17,864 --> 02:02:19,593
What's the matter?

1102
02:02:19,833 --> 02:02:24,861
You are aware that we have
been a tight knit family.

1103
02:02:25,205 --> 02:02:30,165
Brother Anurag, Jyoti,
Sangita, me and the three kids.

1104
02:02:30,443 --> 02:02:33,935
We've had no ill feelings.

1105
02:02:34,214 --> 02:02:37,672
Since Anurag called us from Rampur...

1106
02:02:37,951 --> 02:02:41,682
He seemed changed.

1107
02:02:42,088 --> 02:02:45,353
I thought it was tension of work.

1108
02:02:45,758 --> 02:02:48,750
But yesterday he called us and said...

1109
02:02:49,128 --> 02:02:51,926
We must look for a separate business.

1110
02:02:52,165 --> 02:02:53,894
A separate home.

1111
02:02:54,100 --> 02:02:58,196
Anurag said that? I can't believe it.

1112
02:02:58,371 --> 02:03:00,168
It is true.

1113
02:03:00,373 --> 02:03:04,776
After doing computer engineering
my work has been technical.

1114
02:03:05,245 --> 02:03:08,942
Brother looked after the
company accounts and finances.

1115
02:03:09,282 --> 02:03:12,877
When he transfered the company
property and shares to his name...

1116
02:03:13,152 --> 02:03:15,382
We didn't realize it.

1117
02:03:15,555 --> 02:03:19,514
Tell me, did your father make a will?

1118
02:03:19,692 --> 02:03:22,126
- No, Uncle.
- Then forgive me...

1119
02:03:22,395 --> 02:03:26,923
Your brother has no legal
right to grab everything!

1120
02:03:27,166 --> 02:03:29,964
We can go to court and
stake a claim in everything!

1121
02:03:30,136 --> 02:03:32,229
You will get your right!

1122
02:03:32,472 --> 02:03:34,337
- No, Uncle.
- No?

1123
02:03:34,574 --> 02:03:38,237
The work that father started
with such love and efforts...

1124
02:03:38,544 --> 02:03:43,277
I don't want to drag it to court.

1125
02:03:43,816 --> 02:03:47,252
And then how can I fight my brother?

1126
02:03:47,487 --> 02:03:50,115
This concerns your life.

1127
02:03:50,290 --> 02:03:52,622
Life can be started again.

1128
02:03:52,959 --> 02:03:55,553
We thought we'd shift to Banglore.

1129
02:03:55,828 --> 02:03:57,819
It has a growing computer industry.

1130
02:03:58,097 --> 02:04:02,329
I have friends there.
I'll begin a new project.

1131
02:04:02,568 --> 02:04:06,095
That's not so simple.

1132
02:04:06,439 --> 02:04:11,399
And you have the responsibility
of Sangita and Radhika.

1133
02:04:13,446 --> 02:04:17,940
That's the only thought
that makes me nervous.

1134
02:04:18,418 --> 02:04:21,615
Then I called Vivek.

1135
02:04:21,955 --> 02:04:24,651
When he was in agreement
with my decision...

1136
02:04:24,991 --> 02:04:28,119
I took Anurag's blessings and left.

1137
02:04:28,361 --> 02:04:32,161
Did we take the right decision?

1138
02:04:39,439 --> 02:04:43,671
We're all proud of you.

1139
02:04:46,746 --> 02:04:48,839
The only sad part is...

1140
02:04:49,082 --> 02:04:53,610
The family is broken.

1141
02:04:53,853 --> 02:04:58,756
They will be one again.

1142
02:05:00,493 --> 02:05:02,586
Absolutely.

1143
02:05:04,497 --> 02:05:07,466
Come here, baby.

1144
02:05:08,835 --> 02:05:12,236
Come to me, child.

1145
02:05:17,944 --> 02:05:20,538
I'm very worried.

1146
02:05:20,813 --> 02:05:26,115
How will Anand establish
his work alone in a new city?

1147
02:05:26,352 --> 02:05:30,550
There's no need to worry.
I just spoke to Mr. Richard.

1148
02:05:30,857 --> 02:05:33,826
He's our agent in London
who also deals in computers.

1149
02:05:34,193 --> 02:05:38,823
He wants Anand to join him and
look after the South India business.

1150
02:05:40,566 --> 02:05:43,433
And there's no problem
about accomodatiion there.

1151
02:05:43,736 --> 02:05:46,136
I have a flat there.
Sangita can be comfortable.

1152
02:05:46,606 --> 02:05:49,370
Vinod and I will leave
for Banglore today itself.

1153
02:05:49,609 --> 02:05:52,908
We'll return only after settling them.

1154
02:05:55,081 --> 02:05:59,984
Consider these
difficult times a test.

1155
02:06:00,286 --> 02:06:04,746
You'll see there's some
good hidden in this too.

1156
02:06:05,792 --> 02:06:07,953
- Take this, my dear.
- May I take two more?

1157
02:06:08,194 --> 02:06:10,128
Sure. Here.

1158
02:06:10,496 --> 02:06:12,987
One for Raju and
the other for Bablu.

1159
02:06:13,266 --> 02:06:15,996
I'll give it when we meet.

1160
02:06:21,274 --> 02:06:25,301
Radhika will miss
Raju and Bablu a lot.

1161
02:06:30,817 --> 02:06:32,250
Shall we leave?

1162
02:06:32,585 --> 02:06:34,450
Yes brother.

1163
02:06:35,855 --> 02:06:37,789
See you Mummy.

1164
02:06:40,359 --> 02:06:42,725
Take care dear.

1165
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:07,909
"In happy times or sad..."

1166
02:07:08,221 --> 02:07:15,957
"They who come to the Lord's
refuge face no obstacles."

1167
02:07:16,195 --> 02:07:23,897
"Time and religion may fail you."

1168
02:07:24,303 --> 02:07:31,209
"Surrender yourself at the
Lord's feet and gain solace."

1169
02:07:37,383 --> 02:07:46,917
"Mother don't let your mind
get poisoned by unfortunate."

1170
02:07:47,860 --> 02:07:50,351
I'm very worried.

1171
02:07:53,032 --> 02:07:57,628
What happened to Anand
shouldn't happen to us.

1172
02:08:01,807 --> 02:08:04,605
I don't understand...

1173
02:08:05,011 --> 02:08:08,947
I've come here from Rampur
only to explain this to you!

1174
02:08:09,382 --> 02:08:13,978
Ram Kishen is appointing Vivek
the Managing Director. That's good.

1175
02:08:14,420 --> 02:08:19,255
But in the future if there's a
misunderstanding between the brother?

1176
02:08:20,359 --> 02:08:25,353
What he means is, getting charge of
the business like Anurag if Vivek...

1177
02:08:25,598 --> 02:08:28,863
...blesses Vinod and Prem and
sends them out of the house.

1178
02:08:29,135 --> 02:08:32,332
Vivek loves his brothers
more than his own self!

1179
02:08:32,572 --> 02:08:37,100
Excuse me but the most loving
man changes on getting power.

1180
02:08:38,444 --> 02:08:42,073
You sang praise of Anurag.
What happened?

1181
02:08:42,548 --> 02:08:48,453
Truthfully speaking, I couldn't
bear to see Sangita's sad face.

1182
02:08:48,721 --> 02:08:50,518
The thought brings tears to my eyes!

1183
02:08:50,756 --> 02:08:53,953
The ones whose children
played in Sangita's lap...

1184
02:08:54,193 --> 02:08:56,957
Played with Mumu... They did this!

1185
02:08:57,296 --> 02:08:58,854
With the real brother!

1186
02:08:59,098 --> 02:09:05,094
If a real brother could do this,
don't forget Vivek is a step brother!

1187
02:09:05,238 --> 02:09:08,571
You can't deny the truth.

1188
02:09:10,376 --> 02:09:14,278
Yes, today Anand is
facing such problems.

1189
02:09:14,513 --> 02:09:18,916
He called Vivek to advise him
about what to do.

1190
02:09:19,185 --> 02:09:21,449
And what did Vivek do?

1191
02:09:21,721 --> 02:09:24,884
Tell me the truth, if he really
had the heart of a brother...

1192
02:09:25,124 --> 02:09:27,558
Would he leave his sister mid stream?

1193
02:09:27,827 --> 02:09:30,387
He would fight, do anything!
He'd get her her rights!

1194
02:09:30,563 --> 02:09:34,522
He wouldn't wash his hands
off his sister's responsibility.

1195
02:09:38,571 --> 02:09:41,597
You and your husband are very generous.

1196
02:09:42,508 --> 02:09:46,000
You bore your daughter's
sorrows with a smile.

1197
02:09:46,279 --> 02:09:48,770
But if this same thing
happens to Prem or Vinod...

1198
02:09:49,115 --> 02:09:54,519
Pritam and I won't be
able to bear this sorrow.

1199
02:09:54,854 --> 02:09:58,585
We've given our daughters to you.

1200
02:09:58,824 --> 02:10:02,282
Now their joys and good
fortune lie in your hands.

1201
02:10:02,528 --> 02:10:05,088
What are you doing?

1202
02:10:05,331 --> 02:10:09,062
Vinod will fight and have his way.

1203
02:10:09,368 --> 02:10:12,929
But what about Prem?
Don't we all know him?

1204
02:10:13,272 --> 02:10:16,070
He's way apart from worldliness.

1205
02:10:16,342 --> 02:10:21,006
At least think of him.

1206
02:10:24,150 --> 02:10:28,610
Your husband's dream is great.

1207
02:10:28,921 --> 02:10:31,321
The entire family
lives together happily!

1208
02:10:31,590 --> 02:10:33,353
But is it possible?

1209
02:10:33,626 --> 02:10:35,924
Can two brides live
together without fighting?

1210
02:10:36,162 --> 02:10:39,029
- Show me one house.
- Don't forget...

1211
02:10:39,298 --> 02:10:42,495
The man who runs the office,
his wife rules the home.

1212
02:10:42,735 --> 02:10:45,203
In the future if Sadhna doesn't
make Preeti and Sapna...

1213
02:10:45,371 --> 02:10:47,771
dance to her tune...
I'll eat my words.

1214
02:10:48,007 --> 02:10:52,637
In your shoes I would never hand
the family to Vivek and Sadhna!

1215
02:10:52,945 --> 02:10:56,472
The truth is however much
you may love Vivek and Sadhna...

1216
02:10:56,716 --> 02:10:58,479
He is not your own!

1217
02:10:58,684 --> 02:11:01,175
He is not your blood!

1218
02:12:14,427 --> 02:12:17,885
Yes Sangita, is
everything settled there?

1219
02:12:18,264 --> 02:12:22,064
I see, Anandbabu has gone
to the office with Vivek?

1220
02:12:22,334 --> 02:12:25,861
And what is little Radhika doing?

1221
02:12:26,038 --> 02:12:28,905
She's having breakfast.
Here, talk to her.

1222
02:12:29,208 --> 02:12:32,268
Grandpa, I'm drinking milk by myself.

1223
02:12:32,945 --> 02:12:36,210
I too am drinking milk.

1224
02:12:40,252 --> 02:12:45,087
- How did you land there?
- For goodies made by my daughter.

1225
02:12:45,591 --> 02:12:48,788
In fact, I suggest you
come here with your wife.

1226
02:12:49,562 --> 02:12:52,690
I'll talk to her.

1227
02:12:53,032 --> 02:12:54,897
Talk to him.

1228
02:12:55,100 --> 02:12:58,035
Vivek and I will return by evening.

1229
02:13:00,072 --> 02:13:02,870
Finally, the daughter is happy.

1230
02:13:04,310 --> 02:13:07,711
Mummy hasn't eaten a
thing since last night.

1231
02:13:07,980 --> 02:13:09,971
She seems very worried.

1232
02:13:10,216 --> 02:13:15,381
Send her breakfast upstairs.
I'll talk to her.

1233
02:13:21,193 --> 02:13:24,890
I just spoke to Sangita.
She is happy.

1234
02:13:25,097 --> 02:13:27,429
No need to worry.

1235
02:13:27,666 --> 02:13:31,397
Let's go to her for some days.

1236
02:13:31,704 --> 02:13:33,968
She will appreciate it.

1237
02:13:36,942 --> 02:13:41,902
What's the matter?
Some other worry?

1238
02:13:42,982 --> 02:13:49,387
I don't want Prem and Vinod to
go through Anand's experience.

1239
02:13:50,089 --> 02:13:52,250
What do you mean?

1240
02:13:55,628 --> 02:13:59,325
Why are you appointing
Vivek the Managing Director?

1241
02:13:59,532 --> 02:14:02,933
Is that all?

1242
02:14:03,335 --> 02:14:06,896
Can Vivek ever treat
his brothers in this way?

1243
02:14:07,373 --> 02:14:09,204
Ask your own heart.

1244
02:14:09,475 --> 02:14:11,739
You know him better than I do.

1245
02:14:11,977 --> 02:14:15,913
I know that this family has 3 sons.

1246
02:14:16,549 --> 02:14:22,419
Instead of giving everything to one
divide everything between them.

1247
02:14:23,122 --> 02:14:24,783
What are you saying?

1248
02:14:25,024 --> 02:14:28,619
It's not too late.
It will be done with love.

1249
02:14:29,428 --> 02:14:34,331
And I want it done before
Prem and Vinod get married.

1250
02:14:34,733 --> 02:14:37,361
Do you know what you're saying?

1251
02:14:37,703 --> 02:14:42,333
Split them up? Separate
Vivek, Prem and Vinod?

1252
02:14:42,775 --> 02:14:45,005
These children are our dreams!

1253
02:14:45,244 --> 02:14:49,305
- You want to break them up?
- What dreams are you talking of?

1254
02:14:49,882 --> 02:14:54,046
Our daughter has been
thrown out of her own home!

1255
02:14:58,157 --> 02:15:01,684
Haven't we experienced
highs and lows in life?

1256
02:15:01,961 --> 02:15:04,361
Why are you becoming weak today?

1257
02:15:04,630 --> 02:15:08,259
This is the time we must stay close
and give strength to our daughter.

1258
02:15:08,467 --> 02:15:11,163
I don't want to argue with you.

1259
02:15:11,570 --> 02:15:13,595
For the first time
I'm asking you for something.

1260
02:15:13,872 --> 02:15:16,204
And I want it.

1261
02:15:16,408 --> 02:15:23,541
What you want, you're
asking for... is wrong!

1262
02:15:48,574 --> 02:15:53,068
- Breakfast.
- I'm not hungry.

1263
02:16:25,210 --> 02:16:27,144
Mother.

1264
02:16:35,020 --> 02:16:42,756
I know you are very upset at
what happened with Anand and Sangita.

1265
02:16:43,395 --> 02:16:47,889
Your thinking that this shouldn't
happen in our family too is right.

1266
02:16:48,734 --> 02:16:52,363
But if we split up like this...

1267
02:16:52,671 --> 02:16:54,662
If this house is broken into three...

1268
02:16:54,907 --> 02:16:57,876
Will we be happy?

1269
02:16:59,445 --> 02:17:03,779
Think about it. When
Sangita comes for rakhi...

1270
02:17:04,016 --> 02:17:07,782
To which brother's house
will she go first?

1271
02:17:08,120 --> 02:17:11,180
And we still have to
make Vinod's career.

1272
02:17:11,423 --> 02:17:17,487
His innocence will be stifled
in the division of business.

1273
02:17:17,863 --> 02:17:22,630
Don't punish everybody for me.

1274
02:17:22,835 --> 02:17:25,565
Don't break everyone up.

1275
02:17:25,838 --> 02:17:30,104
I don't want to be
the Managing Director.

1276
02:17:30,342 --> 02:17:32,207
Sadhna and I will go to Rampur.

1277
02:17:32,444 --> 02:17:34,878
The new plant has to be looked after.

1278
02:17:35,180 --> 02:17:37,148
We'll stay there.

1279
02:17:37,349 --> 02:17:41,445
I'll tell Papa to make
Prem the Managing Director.

1280
02:17:46,759 --> 02:17:53,096
I assure you that Prem and Vinod
will never suffer as long as I live.

1281
02:17:55,768 --> 02:17:58,168
Sadhna has brought you dinner.

1282
02:17:58,370 --> 02:18:01,237
Eat a little. For our sake.

1283
02:18:11,216 --> 02:18:13,810
Come on, mother.

1284
02:18:20,092 --> 02:18:23,289
What are you saying?
Both of you will go to Rampur!

1285
02:18:23,562 --> 02:18:25,086
Yes, Vinod.

1286
02:18:25,297 --> 02:18:28,095
What's wrong with it?

1287
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:30,866
Prem will look after everything here.

1288
02:18:31,069 --> 02:18:34,129
And Rampur is not far
Just a few hours away.

1289
02:18:35,307 --> 02:18:39,971
All right then. If you
have decided to go...

1290
02:18:40,112 --> 02:18:43,138
And Mummy is happy about it...

1291
02:18:43,348 --> 02:18:46,317
Then I too will go with you!

1292
02:18:46,585 --> 02:18:49,611
- No Vinod.
- Nobody will go anywhere!

1293
02:18:51,190 --> 02:18:53,454
Nobody will go anywhere.

1294
02:18:54,593 --> 02:18:56,390
May I come in, sir?

1295
02:18:56,528 --> 02:18:58,325
Yes, come in.

1296
02:18:59,431 --> 02:19:00,898
Have you brought all the papers?

1297
02:19:09,775 --> 02:19:12,403
Give it another thought.

1298
02:19:13,345 --> 02:19:15,370
No, Khan.

1299
02:19:16,181 --> 02:19:19,446
The time for seperation is here.

1300
02:19:19,651 --> 02:19:24,179
Sadhna and I are leaving
for Rampur today.

1301
02:19:24,389 --> 02:19:27,381
You won't go anywhere!

1302
02:19:28,126 --> 02:19:31,425
I've given my word to mother.

1303
02:19:38,804 --> 02:19:41,170
Mother, we're leaving.

1304
02:19:41,373 --> 02:19:46,902
Vinod insists of coming along.
I'll send him back soon.

1305
02:19:48,413 --> 02:19:51,007
I'd also like to say this...

1306
02:19:51,183 --> 02:19:54,175
Why this is happening?
The reason behind it...

1307
02:19:54,353 --> 02:19:57,720
People will ask us. Don't
keep a load on your heart.

1308
02:19:57,890 --> 02:20:02,327
No mother will wish ill for her son.

1309
02:20:36,695 --> 02:20:38,663
Forgive me, father.

1310
02:20:39,531 --> 02:20:41,761
I hurt you.

1311
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:47,495
Silly boy. Do the words
of a son hurt a father?

1312
02:20:47,940 --> 02:20:55,642
You are going. Go.
I won't stop you.

1313
02:20:57,916 --> 02:21:03,684
Emulate every quality of your brother.

1314
02:21:04,389 --> 02:21:09,088
Only the fortunate are blessed
with such a son and brother.

1315
02:21:18,236 --> 02:21:21,467
What can I tell you?

1316
02:21:27,980 --> 02:21:31,814
We brought her home
with such splendor.

1317
02:21:33,285 --> 02:21:35,981
Isn't it?

1318
02:22:40,085 --> 02:22:44,283
Excuse my saying this but
this is the law of the world...

1319
02:22:44,790 --> 02:22:47,452
Gradually bonds break up.

1320
02:22:48,260 --> 02:22:51,787
The times you spend together are yours.

1321
02:22:52,097 --> 02:22:55,897
I'm glad you are keeping
yourself busy with work.

1322
02:22:58,470 --> 02:23:03,373
I've studied all the papers. Begin
work on the electricity division.

1323
02:23:04,276 --> 02:23:06,972
From today Vinod will join
me at the factory site.

1324
02:23:09,948 --> 02:23:11,540
How do you feel now?

1325
02:23:11,850 --> 02:23:13,784
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, grandma.

1326
02:23:13,985 --> 02:23:16,954
Exhaustion, I guess.

1327
02:23:17,189 --> 02:23:20,158
Don't make Vinod work too hard.

1328
02:23:21,493 --> 02:23:22,983
That he will have to do.

1329
02:23:23,328 --> 02:23:27,196
He should have full knowledge of
production before the inauguration.

1330
02:23:27,532 --> 02:23:30,626
So he can return and take
training in finance and sales.

1331
02:23:31,103 --> 02:23:33,230
I won't go back.

1332
02:23:35,340 --> 02:23:39,436
I won't leave you and sister-in-law.

1333
02:23:50,255 --> 02:23:53,520
What rain!

1334
02:23:55,393 --> 02:23:56,553
Sister-in-law!

1335
02:24:00,732 --> 02:24:02,063
Sister-in-law...

1336
02:24:03,401 --> 02:24:05,767
They have returned.

1337
02:24:06,638 --> 02:24:08,299
How are you, Vinod?

1338
02:24:08,573 --> 02:24:11,508
- How was the first day at the site?
- Don't ask!

1339
02:24:12,077 --> 02:24:14,477
Today I realize how
hard brother works!

1340
02:24:14,679 --> 02:24:16,840
I'm starving!

1341
02:24:17,115 --> 02:24:19,777
Have a wash. Dinner is ready.

1342
02:24:25,490 --> 02:24:28,687
Go and call the little sir.

1343
02:24:43,175 --> 02:24:44,802
What happened?

1344
02:24:54,586 --> 02:24:56,850
He's dozed off.

1345
02:24:57,155 --> 02:24:59,385
That's because he worked hard today.

1346
02:25:01,259 --> 02:25:04,023
How sweet is the smile on his face.

1347
02:25:05,964 --> 02:25:11,095
The smile has returned to his face.

1348
02:25:11,570 --> 02:25:15,233
But I fear... when Prem returns...

1349
02:25:15,574 --> 02:25:18,907
How will I assure him?

1350
02:25:19,277 --> 02:25:22,804
I think we have talked about it.

1351
02:25:22,981 --> 02:25:26,041
Yes. Prem returns today.

1352
02:25:26,318 --> 02:25:29,810
Don't spoil our mood by
repeating the same thing.

1353
02:25:30,155 --> 02:25:34,251
Kindly leave us alone.
I want to talk to my sister.

1354
02:25:46,438 --> 02:25:49,601
I don't have anything
left to say to you.

1355
02:25:50,875 --> 02:25:54,606
The only sorrow is...

1356
02:25:54,946 --> 02:25:59,508
Today I have no face left
to meet Ram Kishen's eyes.

1357
02:25:59,751 --> 02:26:03,209
On whose instigation did you
do this? These butterflies?

1358
02:26:04,823 --> 02:26:08,850
Those who never settled down,
can't teach us to run our homes!

1359
02:26:09,527 --> 02:26:11,654
They only want to watch the scene!

1360
02:26:11,963 --> 02:26:15,626
They will end the play here and
go elsewhere for the curtains!

1361
02:26:16,134 --> 02:26:18,568
I am a lawyer.

1362
02:26:18,803 --> 02:26:22,466
I've seen families bickering,
relationships breaking up.

1363
02:26:23,508 --> 02:26:28,605
I can only say that nobody has
been happy breaking their families.

1364
02:26:28,947 --> 02:26:30,972
Nobody can be happy.

1365
02:26:31,349 --> 02:26:32,907
See for yourself! Your Prem has
gone straight to meet Vivek.

1366
02:26:33,118 --> 02:26:35,211
Instead of coming to see you!

1367
02:26:37,822 --> 02:26:39,687
This is not possible.

1368
02:26:41,660 --> 02:26:42,786
Why not?

1369
02:26:43,028 --> 02:26:45,223
Son, we will return
with you and Sadhna.

1370
02:26:46,531 --> 02:26:51,434
We've shared so many moments
of happiness with this family.

1371
02:26:51,803 --> 02:26:54,169
I won't let it be overcast
be clouds of sorrow!

1372
02:26:54,406 --> 02:27:00,003
Today is such a happy day.
We hear Sadhna's giving us good news.

1373
02:27:01,179 --> 02:27:03,613
Accompany Prem even if only
to share this good news!

1374
02:27:04,215 --> 02:27:06,683
Adarsh, you tell Vivek.

1375
02:27:09,254 --> 02:27:14,658
I understand your
feelings and Prem's too.

1376
02:27:14,893 --> 02:27:21,059
Nobody would be happier than me
if Vivek & Sadhna return to the fold.

1377
02:27:22,100 --> 02:27:27,595
But Vivek's silence says a lot.

1378
02:27:30,542 --> 02:27:35,844
Vivek is doing his duty.
You do yours.

1379
02:27:36,114 --> 02:27:39,845
Ram Kishen and the business needs you.

1380
02:27:45,690 --> 02:27:49,854
Aunt, it is Ram Kishen's values...

1381
02:27:50,195 --> 02:27:56,964
...that two brothers today
fight for each others' happiness.

1382
02:28:27,465 --> 02:28:30,127
All you brothers are the same.

1383
02:28:31,336 --> 02:28:34,203
One heart beats in all three chests.

1384
02:28:34,973 --> 02:28:39,876
For the first time I've
seen you brothers fighting.

1385
02:28:42,147 --> 02:28:47,585
The one we fight with...
we love him the most.

1386
02:28:50,955 --> 02:28:53,253
Listen to me, Prem.

1387
02:28:53,658 --> 02:28:58,027
Go back before I become weak.

1388
02:29:28,159 --> 02:29:30,719
The little fellow too is here.

1389
02:29:34,098 --> 02:29:35,588
How are you?

1390
02:29:36,501 --> 02:29:39,937
We're going to become Uncles.
You the elder one, me the younger.

1391
02:29:40,472 --> 02:29:42,497
Rosogollas from the sweetmeat shop.

1392
02:29:44,108 --> 02:29:45,803
The first one is for Uncle.

1393
02:29:46,244 --> 02:29:47,643
Bought specially for you.

1394
02:29:47,912 --> 02:29:49,846
- No, I won't eat today.
- Why?

1395
02:29:50,048 --> 02:29:51,538
Just don't feel like it.

1396
02:29:52,383 --> 02:29:55,546
- Not even one?
- Just half...

1397
02:30:00,592 --> 02:30:06,292
Have one. I'm glad though in
a way, we are together.

1398
02:30:09,267 --> 02:30:11,633
You don't talk to Prem.
We'll talk to him.

1399
02:30:15,240 --> 02:30:17,037
Sounds like him!

1400
02:30:20,778 --> 02:30:22,006
Did you call for me?

1401
02:30:22,180 --> 02:30:24,614
Yes, son. Come inside!

1402
02:30:28,152 --> 02:30:30,518
Come in and sit down.

1403
02:30:33,491 --> 02:30:35,482
Whatever your mother did,
good or bad...

1404
02:30:35,727 --> 02:30:38,195
It's for your good and Vinod's.

1405
02:30:38,863 --> 02:30:41,798
A mother gambles all that
she has for her children.

1406
02:30:42,267 --> 02:30:45,259
So don't be mad with your mother.

1407
02:30:46,704 --> 02:30:49,172
I say, what has she done?

1408
02:30:49,474 --> 02:30:53,342
Since she heard, Sadhana
is giving us good news...

1409
02:30:53,645 --> 02:30:55,840
We've been spreading joys!

1410
02:30:56,080 --> 02:30:58,947
We're distributing saris
to all the ladies in Club.

1411
02:30:59,183 --> 02:31:03,244
And this silver present for
all friends and relatives.

1412
02:31:03,755 --> 02:31:05,052
What else is required?

1413
02:31:05,290 --> 02:31:07,656
Even a real mother wouldn't do this.

1414
02:31:12,063 --> 02:31:13,894
May I leave?

1415
02:31:16,067 --> 02:31:18,501
Everything will remain the same.

1416
02:31:18,770 --> 02:31:24,572
Nothing here is the same.
Neither you nor me.

1417
02:31:28,646 --> 02:31:31,615
See what Vivek has written to me.

1418
02:31:32,483 --> 02:31:36,249
Today Prem has become
the Managing Director.

1419
02:31:36,854 --> 02:31:38,788
Stay with him all day.

1420
02:31:39,023 --> 02:31:40,991
Close to him.

1421
02:31:41,492 --> 02:31:44,928
He has never measured
relations with money.

1422
02:31:45,463 --> 02:31:48,864
We always considered his
simplicity his weakness.

1423
02:31:50,034 --> 02:31:53,595
Actually that is his strength.

1424
02:31:54,305 --> 02:31:56,899
Give him lots of love.

1425
02:32:08,152 --> 02:32:09,642
May I ask you something?

1426
02:32:10,822 --> 02:32:14,588
When the elder brother's love
and father's blessing are with you...

1427
02:32:15,660 --> 02:32:18,060
Why don't you sit on your chair?

1428
02:32:18,663 --> 02:32:20,494
Why here...?

1429
02:32:22,133 --> 02:32:24,158
This is elder brother's right.

1430
02:32:26,204 --> 02:32:28,638
Whenever he returns, whichever day...

1431
02:32:29,273 --> 02:32:31,537
He'll find everything the same.

1432
02:32:32,744 --> 02:32:36,180
You worry for no reasomn.
It will take Prem time to realize.

1433
02:32:39,884 --> 02:32:42,751
We achieved what we wanted.

1434
02:32:43,287 --> 02:32:45,448
He has become the Managing Director!

1435
02:32:46,958 --> 02:32:51,361
You just make his favorite
dishes and feed him yourself.

1436
02:32:52,130 --> 02:32:56,294
We'll see how long the son
will be mad with the mother.

1437
02:33:02,840 --> 02:33:04,569
Bye bhaijaan.

1438
02:33:07,445 --> 02:33:12,246
You haven't eaten a thing since
morning. Eat something now.

1439
02:33:13,584 --> 02:33:15,814
Yes Bhaijaan.

1440
02:33:44,782 --> 02:33:47,410
Wash up and come. Dinner is ready.

1441
02:33:48,519 --> 02:33:51,682
No, mother. I'm not hungry.

1442
02:33:57,261 --> 02:33:59,786
All your favorite dishes.

1443
02:34:00,598 --> 02:34:02,566
I made them.

1444
02:34:04,669 --> 02:34:07,900
I'm not hungry.

1445
02:34:26,257 --> 02:34:29,988
I've shifted your things
to the room upstairs.

1446
02:34:37,201 --> 02:34:38,600
Where are you going?

1447
02:34:38,803 --> 02:34:42,933
To bring my things
back from Vivek's room.

1448
02:35:10,802 --> 02:35:15,034
You and Preeti have to
stay here after marriage.

1449
02:35:15,640 --> 02:35:18,006
How did you even think of it?

1450
02:35:19,577 --> 02:35:22,808
The entire fault is mine!

1451
02:35:23,314 --> 02:35:25,544
I'm to be blamed!

1452
02:35:25,817 --> 02:35:31,221
I love you so much!
Fight the world for you!

1453
02:35:31,889 --> 02:35:34,289
Doesn't a mother have this right?

1454
02:35:34,759 --> 02:35:39,423
She does. Only if she doesn't
differentiate between the kids.

1455
02:35:39,664 --> 02:35:43,600
I didn't do anything.
Vivek left on his own.

1456
02:35:43,901 --> 02:35:46,529
And you let him go?

1457
02:35:49,574 --> 02:35:52,805
Tomorrow if I want to leave
everything and go away...

1458
02:35:53,010 --> 02:35:55,137
Will you let me go?

1459
02:35:55,313 --> 02:35:57,645
Won't you stop me?

1460
02:35:58,516 --> 02:36:04,148
Right from childhood, Vivek
has respected you more than us.

1461
02:36:05,556 --> 02:36:07,990
He has loved you the most.

1462
02:36:08,426 --> 02:36:10,519
And you forgot all this!

1463
02:36:10,795 --> 02:36:14,561
Try to recall. The Prem and Vinod
for whom you're fighting yourself...

1464
02:36:14,932 --> 02:36:17,958
They would have left you
and gone away long back!

1465
02:36:18,236 --> 02:36:21,694
If Vivek hadn't lost his
arm to save their lives!

1466
02:36:24,942 --> 02:36:29,606
For what happened to Sangita,
you're blaming brother Vivek.

1467
02:36:33,117 --> 02:36:36,644
Thinking of Sangita
brings tears to our eyes.

1468
02:36:37,021 --> 02:36:40,252
The name of Anurag
fills us with anger.

1469
02:36:40,524 --> 02:36:42,856
But are we less at
blame than Anurag?

1470
02:36:43,294 --> 02:36:46,457
The Sadhna whom we lovingly
brought home as a bride...

1471
02:36:46,831 --> 02:36:48,594
We made her a stranger in a moment!

1472
02:36:48,799 --> 02:36:52,235
When she waits at the
foot steps of motherhood!

1473
02:36:52,503 --> 02:36:54,630
Isn't this discrimination?

1474
02:36:54,839 --> 02:36:56,864
You've acted as a
step-mother, not Vivek!

1475
02:37:02,346 --> 02:37:04,746
Nobody can take the place
of brother Vivek and Sadhna.

1476
02:37:05,182 --> 02:37:09,084
Neither in this house nor in
this room. Nor in this heart.

1477
02:37:10,288 --> 02:37:13,917
And if your conditiion is that
I step into Vivek's shoes...

1478
02:37:14,292 --> 02:37:16,783
and Preeti into Sadhna's...

1479
02:37:17,061 --> 02:37:21,828
I swear by Sadhna,
I will never get married!

1480
02:37:34,578 --> 02:37:36,842
Uncle, forgive me.

1481
02:37:37,748 --> 02:37:39,807
I can't get married.

1482
02:37:40,151 --> 02:37:44,485
I knew this would be your decision.

1483
02:37:46,724 --> 02:37:51,093
The country that honors the brother
as a father and his wife as mother...

1484
02:37:51,562 --> 02:37:54,531
Prem will never crush their joys
to erect his own palace of dreams.

1485
02:37:56,801 --> 02:37:58,098
I knew it.

1486
02:38:00,104 --> 02:38:02,572
I had already told Preeti.

1487
02:38:21,058 --> 02:38:23,083
Won't you stay?

1488
02:38:30,234 --> 02:38:34,193
I wouldn't have been able to take
Sadhna's rights even if you asked me.

1489
02:38:44,248 --> 02:38:45,977
Sit down.

1490
02:39:26,157 --> 02:39:28,455
Whether we're tied in a bond or not...

1491
02:39:29,427 --> 02:39:33,329
We're tied in an
emotiional bond of hearts.

1492
02:39:33,531 --> 02:39:34,657
Isn't it?

1493
02:39:50,381 --> 02:39:52,349
Don't worry about Sadhna.

1494
02:39:54,318 --> 02:39:57,253
Her delivery is my responsibility.

1495
02:39:58,022 --> 02:40:01,549
It will be a normal delivery.

1496
02:40:03,160 --> 02:40:07,096
You might have to go to
the hospital any moment.

1497
02:40:07,731 --> 02:40:11,258
- Sit down.
- See what father sent for you.

1498
02:40:12,169 --> 02:40:14,603
A little Krishna.

1499
02:40:15,272 --> 02:40:18,400
He wants you to always keep
this idol in front of you.

1500
02:40:19,810 --> 02:40:22,711
- Give it to me.
- Why are you staying here?

1501
02:40:23,080 --> 02:40:26,846
- Sapna is here.
- I've taken official leave from sir.

1502
02:40:27,351 --> 02:40:29,649
I'm going to stay
here till you deliver.

1503
02:40:30,154 --> 02:40:31,849
Tea...

1504
02:40:32,556 --> 02:40:36,959
Doctor, Preeti is staying
here leaving all her work.

1505
02:40:38,262 --> 02:40:43,222
And Sapna isn't taking part
in her college cultural program.

1506
02:40:43,567 --> 02:40:46,627
I have three daughters not one.

1507
02:40:47,938 --> 02:40:53,205
Vinod will complete training by
the time the factory is inaugurated.

1508
02:40:54,111 --> 02:40:56,773
Then we'll send him back to the city.

1509
02:40:57,982 --> 02:41:01,782
Time just flew by
laughing with Sapna.

1510
02:41:02,453 --> 02:41:05,547
We didn't realize anything.

1511
02:41:05,789 --> 02:41:08,656
Time moves at its' own pace.

1512
02:41:09,693 --> 02:41:14,096
Time takes its' tests
all the time in some way.

1513
02:41:15,199 --> 02:41:18,726
I don't understand! Why has
productiion in the factory stopped?

1514
02:41:19,403 --> 02:41:21,268
We faced technical
problems earrlier too!

1515
02:41:21,572 --> 02:41:24,006
Sir, Anand could tackle them.

1516
02:41:27,778 --> 02:41:29,712
I've heard this a number of times.

1517
02:41:29,947 --> 02:41:32,313
Quickly appoint a good engineer.

1518
02:41:32,583 --> 02:41:34,813
In this manner, we won't be
able to clear the bank loans!

1519
02:41:42,026 --> 02:41:44,290
I'm on my way.

1520
02:42:05,716 --> 02:42:07,741
Now how are they?

1521
02:42:07,952 --> 02:42:10,079
They still have high temperature.

1522
02:42:10,287 --> 02:42:13,723
Jyoti mentioned that they haven't
been eating well for some days.

1523
02:42:14,158 --> 02:42:16,490
They've stopped playing too.

1524
02:42:17,494 --> 02:42:21,658
- Yes.
- Anyway continue the medicines.

1525
02:42:22,132 --> 02:42:23,622
Inform me tomorrow morning.

1526
02:42:26,337 --> 02:42:28,737
I have to talk to you.

1527
02:42:29,273 --> 02:42:32,299
I want to say something to
you as your family doctor.

1528
02:42:34,411 --> 02:42:37,744
Children are as delicate as flowers.

1529
02:42:38,616 --> 02:42:42,347
If they don't find a loving
enviroment, they wither away.

1530
02:42:43,787 --> 02:42:45,812
And that's not good.

1531
02:42:46,290 --> 02:42:51,626
I'm unable to give them time
because of my problems at work.

1532
02:42:52,563 --> 02:42:55,191
I often lose my temper with them.

1533
02:42:55,499 --> 02:42:58,559
Yesterday you raised your hand at them.

1534
02:42:59,036 --> 02:43:01,300
They were being stubborn.

1535
02:43:01,538 --> 02:43:04,098
They wanted to go to
Anand and Sangita.

1536
02:43:04,375 --> 02:43:07,742
Why don't you give in to them?

1537
02:43:10,714 --> 02:43:15,913
Don't lose the peace of your
family to personal grudges.

1538
02:43:16,353 --> 02:43:19,584
Or no doctor will be able to help.

1539
02:44:12,476 --> 02:44:15,411
Anand and his wife have come!

1540
02:44:15,746 --> 02:44:17,976
With Radhika!

1541
02:44:25,856 --> 02:44:28,416
Brother!

1542
02:44:35,933 --> 02:44:39,460
You didn't inform us that
Raju and Bablu were so ill.

1543
02:44:40,671 --> 02:44:43,834
We left as soon as
sister-in-law called up.

1544
02:44:51,148 --> 02:44:54,311
You didn't consider us family.

1545
02:44:57,121 --> 02:44:59,487
Forgive me.

1546
02:45:01,759 --> 02:45:04,819
Forgive me.

1547
02:45:07,398 --> 02:45:09,491
What are you saying?

1548
02:45:09,767 --> 02:45:12,395
I had turned blind with selfishness.

1549
02:45:12,669 --> 02:45:15,866
I acheived one success
after another in business.

1550
02:45:16,106 --> 02:45:19,234
I assumed it was because of me.

1551
02:45:19,643 --> 02:45:25,707
But after Anand left, I found
out the success wasn't mine.

1552
02:45:26,250 --> 02:45:29,686
But of our team.

1553
02:45:30,254 --> 02:45:33,314
Since Anand left home,
without asking or taking anything...

1554
02:45:33,624 --> 02:45:36,957
I haven't had any peace.

1555
02:45:37,361 --> 02:45:40,660
I lost everything I had.

1556
02:45:40,964 --> 02:45:42,693
The happiness of the children.

1557
02:45:43,100 --> 02:45:45,694
The smile on Jyoti's face.

1558
02:45:46,203 --> 02:45:48,637
But we're together again!

1559
02:45:48,906 --> 02:45:50,840
We will live together.

1560
02:45:52,376 --> 02:45:55,436
Today is such a joyous day.

1561
02:45:56,246 --> 02:45:59,511
My daughter's house
is settled again.

1562
02:46:01,084 --> 02:46:05,350
We've come to ask you for something.

1563
02:46:06,190 --> 02:46:10,183
Ask brother Vivek to return home.

1564
02:46:14,631 --> 02:46:20,001
It was Vivek's belief that
we'll be together again.

1565
02:46:21,104 --> 02:46:25,507
I remember the day we were
leaving for Banglore...

1566
02:46:25,776 --> 02:46:28,404
He placed his hand on
my head and said...

1567
02:46:28,612 --> 02:46:32,548
All your sorrows be mine
May all my joys be yours.

1568
02:46:57,274 --> 02:46:59,799
I've committed a grave sin!

1569
02:47:00,143 --> 02:47:02,441
A grave sin!

1570
02:47:02,679 --> 02:47:04,579
Nothing is lost.

1571
02:47:05,983 --> 02:47:07,883
Look there.

1572
02:47:21,098 --> 02:47:23,032
No, Mamta.

1573
02:47:23,500 --> 02:47:25,900
You are the same Mamta for me.

1574
02:47:26,303 --> 02:47:29,363
...who gave our children
such a noble upbringing.

1575
02:47:29,673 --> 02:47:32,506
Made them such good humans.

1576
02:47:33,710 --> 02:47:37,271
Shall we go to Rampur?

1577
02:47:37,481 --> 02:47:40,780
We are going to be grandparents.

1578
02:47:42,119 --> 02:47:45,611
Yes, Sadhna needs you
the most at this hour.

1579
02:47:49,493 --> 02:47:51,518
Anything to worry about?

1580
02:47:51,728 --> 02:47:53,958
No, Sadhna is fine.

1581
02:47:55,632 --> 02:47:58,692
Start the final testing of the
machines. We're off to the hospital.

1582
02:48:01,605 --> 02:48:04,039
- Brother is here!
- Hurrah!

1583
02:48:04,508 --> 02:48:07,671
- You've become a Papa!
- You have a son!

1584
02:48:10,013 --> 02:48:11,742
Many congratulations.

1585
02:48:12,149 --> 02:48:14,276
- You...?
- Talk later.

1586
02:48:14,785 --> 02:48:16,685
Sangita, take him in.

1587
02:48:16,954 --> 02:48:18,581
Let's go.

1588
02:48:33,370 --> 02:48:35,338
Mother...

1589
02:48:36,573 --> 02:48:40,009
I've come to take my
daughter-in-law and grandson home.

1590
02:48:40,344 --> 02:48:43,313
I won't take him.

1591
02:48:45,549 --> 02:48:49,781
You left. Not once did
you ask your mother...

1592
02:48:50,420 --> 02:48:53,116
What is my fault?

1593
02:49:13,477 --> 02:49:17,106
Attentiion! The heir to the
family is making his entry!

1594
02:49:18,315 --> 02:49:20,442
- Give the baby to me!
- No!

1595
02:49:21,118 --> 02:49:23,177
- I'm the aunt!
- No!

1596
02:49:23,353 --> 02:49:25,048
It's the Papa's turn first.

1597
02:49:25,422 --> 02:49:28,983
No, first of all it's
the turn of Papa's mummy.

1598
02:49:35,065 --> 02:49:38,831
Aunt, compared to all
the joys of the world...

1599
02:49:39,169 --> 02:49:41,569
The joy of becoming a
grandmother is the best.

1600
02:49:45,275 --> 02:49:48,608
Mother, all of us are in
line to meet the baby.

1601
02:49:49,379 --> 02:49:52,871
- Me, first.
- Sure.

1602
02:49:53,350 --> 02:49:55,784
Aunt before the Uncle.

1603
02:49:57,020 --> 02:49:59,454
Let's love him together.

1604
02:50:00,023 --> 02:50:04,483
It's also the right of the elder
uncle and aunt to love the baby.

1605
02:50:08,965 --> 02:50:11,126
Yes, Prem.

1606
02:50:12,969 --> 02:50:15,631
One day for my sake...

1607
02:50:15,972 --> 02:50:18,770
You took a pledge in front of mother.

1608
02:50:18,975 --> 02:50:20,704
Today for my sake I want you,

1609
02:50:20,844 --> 02:50:22,778
You take another pledge.

1610
02:50:54,778 --> 02:50:56,746
Garland her.

1611
02:50:59,282 --> 02:51:02,012
Here is your Mummy!

1612
02:51:24,341 --> 02:51:26,935
- Okay, you may...
- I have garlanded her.

1613
02:52:01,178 --> 02:52:07,208
Sister-in-law, on thid joyous
occasion I've brought special sweets!

1614
02:52:07,484 --> 02:52:09,349
You really do too much!

1615
02:52:09,619 --> 02:52:14,318
Forgive me for all that I did
so far was with ulterior motives.

1616
02:52:14,624 --> 02:52:17,991
Blinded by love for my daughter.

1617
02:52:18,228 --> 02:52:21,629
I fed flour to the ants,
watered the god of the trees.

1618
02:52:21,932 --> 02:52:25,732
- Prayers, invocatioin...
- Yes, I did all that.

1619
02:52:26,269 --> 02:52:32,731
But I couldn't shake the
foundation of your family.

1620
02:52:34,578 --> 02:52:37,172
Mother Ram Kishen is right.

1621
02:52:37,414 --> 02:52:39,814
It's all a game of values.
