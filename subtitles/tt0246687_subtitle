1
00:03:11,283 --> 00:03:13,308
You go ahead, I will be on guard now.

2
00:03:13,385 --> 00:03:14,443
Ok.

3
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,317
Ask her, she has not eaten
anything till now.

4
00:03:16,388 --> 00:03:17,446
I will go and see.

5
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,438
Do you want anything?

6
00:03:43,649 --> 00:03:44,741
Are you not hungry?

7
00:03:52,558 --> 00:03:55,152
Did you come to know anything
about your man?

8
00:03:56,228 --> 00:03:57,286
No. But we will find out soon.

9
00:03:58,497 --> 00:04:01,159
Do not worry; we will let
you go as soon as he comes.

10
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:27,690
Today's headlines are as follows.

11
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,125
'Chief minister Mrs. Malti
Barve will receive...

12
00:04:30,195 --> 00:04:31,457
...a civic reception in Panvel.'

13
00:04:32,197 --> 00:04:34,290
'20 people injured in a rail
accident in Yavatmal.'

14
00:04:35,701 --> 00:04:39,137
'Mrs. Malti Barve, who is now
also the party president...

15
00:04:39,204 --> 00:04:42,139

in Panvel today.'

16
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:44,302
'Preparations are on in full swing.'

17
00:04:44,376 --> 00:04:46,435
'Security is of the topmost level.'

18
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:47,636
Your daughter has been kidnapped.

19
00:04:47,713 --> 00:04:49,271
Is there any news of her?

20
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:53,877
No, there is no news of her.
But we are trying our best.

21
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,152
There are rumours that
they want to free...

22
00:04:56,221 --> 00:04:58,485
...some of their men, is
that the reason why...

23
00:04:58,557 --> 00:04:59,615
They are not my personal enemies.

24
00:04:59,691 --> 00:05:00,817
They are the culprits
of the entire nation.

25
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,254
Are you not worried
about your daughter?

26
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,160
No. My personal worries are
much less than the nations.

27
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:11,101
After the love and respect
that I have received...

28
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:12,568
...from the people of this country.

29
00:05:13,171 --> 00:05:17,801
Am I still eligible to say that
I have only 1 daughter or 1 son?

30
00:05:34,192 --> 00:05:35,284
Long live the nation.

31
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:38,857
Long live the nation.

32
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,522
Long live the nation.

33
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:41,657
Long live the nation.

34
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:42,791
Long live the nation.

35
00:05:43,335 --> 00:05:44,825
Long live the nation.

36
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,571
Long live the nation.

37
00:05:53,578 --> 00:05:55,409
Long live the nation.

38
00:05:56,214 --> 00:05:58,307
Long live the nation.

39
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,641
Long live the nation.

40
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,149
Long live the nation.
- Long live the nation.

41
00:06:03,622 --> 00:06:05,487
The holy book is mine.

42
00:06:06,425 --> 00:06:08,154
The history is mine.

43
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,685
Etiquette is mine.

44
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,293
Faith is mine.

45
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:16,600
This is my land of duty.

46
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:20,729
This is my land of birth.

47
00:06:20,806 --> 00:06:22,569
Long live the nation.

48
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:25,166
Long live the nation.

49
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,669
Long live the nation.

50
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,171
Long live the nation.

51
00:06:32,651 --> 00:06:34,414
Greetings.
- Greetings.

52
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,121
Malti, he is the head
of our ruling party...

53
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:39,623
...Mr. Sawantrao Gadre.
- Greetings.

54
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:41,687
All of you sit down!

55
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:47,257
Panna, you too can sit down.

56
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:52,136
He wants to make a centre for
all the working ladies...

57
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,798
...in this area who
will work for him.

58
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,200
I could not think of a better
candidate than you.

59
00:06:59,344 --> 00:07:02,711
But what do I know of politics?

60
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:06,615
No, there is no politics involved.

61
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:10,081
Whatever you have been
teaching till now...

62
00:07:10,155 --> 00:07:12,146
...you just have to do that.

63
00:07:12,657 --> 00:07:15,353
You come. Go to the neighbouring
villages.

64
00:07:15,494 --> 00:07:18,088
Work with the ladies there. We
will give you every facility...

65
00:07:18,163 --> 00:07:20,097
...that you might need.

66
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:23,693
After all it is social work.

67
00:07:24,636 --> 00:07:26,103
Where else will you
get the opportunity...

68
00:07:26,171 --> 00:07:27,661
...to serve the society
and the country?

69
00:07:28,173 --> 00:07:32,633
What else is social work?
This is it'.

70
00:07:33,178 --> 00:07:35,703
Mr. Annasaheb Sawantrao
Gadre was my teacher.

71
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,448
He taught me to work from the
grass root level for the party.

72
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:44,248
It is thanks to him that I am
the chief minister today.

73
00:07:44,723 --> 00:07:46,122
I have his blessings with me.

74
00:07:47,626 --> 00:07:50,356
To open a centre for
the working ladies...

75
00:07:50,695 --> 00:07:52,128
Mr. Annasaheb Gadre introduced me...

76
00:07:52,197 --> 00:07:54,859
...to the ladies of the
backward villages.

77
00:07:55,467 --> 00:07:57,332
'Lt is very necessary to
make a Ladies centre.

78
00:07:59,204 --> 00:08:00,193
I will come back soon.

79
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:01,671
Long live sister, Malti.

80
00:08:02,407 --> 00:08:04,307
Long live sister, Malti.

81
00:08:05,644 --> 00:08:09,603
Ok, when I get back; I will
see your work. Lets go!

82
00:09:00,398 --> 00:09:01,456
Who was it?

83
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,694
Don't know! Something
fell from up there.

84
00:09:07,405 --> 00:09:09,134
Didn't you see anybody?

85
00:09:09,207 --> 00:09:10,265
No, there was nobody.

86
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:11,570
Then why don't you go and see?

87
00:09:11,643 --> 00:09:12,701
But there is nobody.

88
00:09:12,777 --> 00:09:14,074
Keep a proper watch as
to where are these...

89
00:09:14,145 --> 00:09:16,375
...stones coming from?
- OK.

90
00:09:31,596 --> 00:09:33,564
Get up.
- Yes.

91
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:41,269
Come on get up. Why did
you go to the school?

92
00:09:42,173 --> 00:09:44,164
When? In the morning?

93
00:09:44,442 --> 00:09:48,105
No, right now. Why had you gone...

94
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:50,739
...to the school guest
house? - Who me?

95
00:09:51,182 --> 00:09:54,117
Telling a lie? Born liar.
You had to be born...

96
00:09:54,185 --> 00:09:56,244
...from my womb?

97
00:09:56,454 --> 00:09:59,548
Malti, why are you hitting
the poor child?

98
00:10:01,326 --> 00:10:02,816
Why will she go up there
so late in the night?

99
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,385
And these shoes? Did they
go by themselves?

100
00:10:06,464 --> 00:10:08,864
The watchman gave it to
me from the rooftop.

101
00:10:09,634 --> 00:10:11,295
Did it walk on its own?

102
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,401
Why? Did you go there?

103
00:10:14,606 --> 00:10:16,301
No. I didn't go anywhere.

104
00:10:16,374 --> 00:10:20,208
I slept at 8 o'clock and
also ate food by myself.

105
00:10:21,212 --> 00:10:24,147
You liar! Her habits are
like a local goon.

106
00:10:24,716 --> 00:10:27,480
I fear what will she turn
into as she grows up.

107
00:10:27,552 --> 00:10:28,610
Malti!

108
00:10:29,354 --> 00:10:31,879
She will degrade herself
and us. You watch out!

109
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:32,212
Blackie! Blackie! Blackie!

110
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,719
Come, we are shifting from here.

111
00:11:40,358 --> 00:11:45,227
Where? Why?

112
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,723
Get lost!

113
00:11:50,235 --> 00:11:52,703
You stand up and turn around!

114
00:11:53,738 --> 00:11:55,899
Make it fast; there are
orders to leave early.

115
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:58,567
Who is it?

116
00:11:58,643 --> 00:12:00,838
Keep your mouth shut and hurry up.

117
00:12:01,112 --> 00:12:02,170
But who is it?

118
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:08,118
Is Blackie coming along?
My cute little dog?

119
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,244
Yes, he is coming along.

120
00:12:10,655 --> 00:12:12,850
Will he come to where we are going?

121
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,183
No, it is quite far.

122
00:12:21,466 --> 00:12:22,626
What happened to Blackie?

123
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,327
Nothing, Walk along quietly!

124
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,630
Come here.

125
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,796
Yes, coming.

126
00:12:29,674 --> 00:12:31,869
Shivram, be ready to pour this.
- Yes sir.

127
00:12:33,645 --> 00:12:35,875
Hey Kasam, is it getting
ready? - Yes sir!

128
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,273
I asked you to leave.

129
00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:39,407
Ok sir!

130
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,276
Make it fast

131
00:12:42,487 --> 00:12:43,613
Daddy! There is a car.

132
00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:45,547
Kasam, take this.

133
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,788
Wow! A state vehicle!

134
00:12:53,865 --> 00:12:55,560
You have become a government
official.

135
00:12:55,633 --> 00:12:56,759
Give that to me.

136
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,466
Your suitcase too has
become city slick.

137
00:13:01,606 --> 00:13:02,834
I am coming from the city.

138
00:13:03,441 --> 00:13:04,499
You may go now.

139
00:13:22,694 --> 00:13:24,855
Why did Sawantrao send
so many things?

140
00:13:25,463 --> 00:13:27,192
That too for everybody?

141
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:31,362
It was Gudi Padwa! He was
buying for his family.

142
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,596
So he bought for us as well!

143
00:13:33,471 --> 00:13:34,733
What difference does it make to him?

144
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,607
Is it?
- Of course!

145
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:41,269
What are his earnings?

146
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,214
There are no salaries over there.
- Then?

147
00:13:44,482 --> 00:13:48,851
Life does not run on salaries.
Here this is for you.

148
00:13:51,656 --> 00:13:54,591
He was asking me to join
the party office.

149
00:13:55,226 --> 00:13:56,750
He was saying there is nothing
left in being a teacher.

150
00:13:57,228 --> 00:13:58,286
Even if I become a head mistress...

151
00:13:58,363 --> 00:13:59,421
...what difference will it make?

152
00:13:59,864 --> 00:14:01,092
In other words you will
be staying in the city...

153
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,100
...and we will be living here.

154
00:14:03,168 --> 00:14:05,102
Why here? All of us
will go to the city.

155
00:14:07,172 --> 00:14:08,639
Our kids can go to a big school.

156
00:14:09,174 --> 00:14:10,664
Panna has to go to college too.

157
00:14:11,609 --> 00:14:13,304
Which college will you enrol me to?

158
00:14:15,446 --> 00:14:16,708
Don't worry; I will enrol you too!

159
00:14:16,781 --> 00:14:17,839
Ok.

160
00:14:18,616 --> 00:14:19,776
There is a lot of work in the city.

161
00:14:19,851 --> 00:14:21,113
You mean to say I should
leave my business...

162
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:23,484
...for a job in the city?

163
00:14:25,456 --> 00:14:29,324
Politics is not a job. It
is a very big business.

164
00:14:30,195 --> 00:14:34,188
Is it? You are already talking
like a big politician.'

165
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:54,776
Come up.

166
00:15:58,683 --> 00:15:59,877
Do you recognise me?

167
00:16:20,672 --> 00:16:27,373
What are you doing here?
And why am I here?

168
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,815
Are you the reason for this?

169
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,851
Don't ask too many questions.

170
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,853
With time you will know everything.

171
00:16:41,693 --> 00:16:48,758
In how much time? Who is the
person you want to set free?

172
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:52,527
And for whom am I being
made a hostage?

173
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,664
I told you, I cannot tell
you anything now.

174
00:16:57,775 --> 00:16:58,833
When will you tell me then?

175
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,736
Tomorrow after the sun rises.

176
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:08,385
What is going to happen then?

177
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:13,090
I can only tell you that you are
not going to be tortured...

178
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:17,150
...but will be killed directly.

179
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,810
I know that it is my mother's
civic reception tomorrow.

180
00:17:43,621 --> 00:17:44,781
Then, you know a lot of things.

181
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:51,517
How is it related to me?
That function?

182
00:17:53,464 --> 00:17:55,364
We have to take you there.

183
00:17:57,135 --> 00:17:58,397
Alive or...
- Alive!

184
00:17:59,637 --> 00:18:01,502
If our man is back alive then...

185
00:18:05,143 --> 00:18:08,635
If not; then your dead body will go.

186
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,382
The person you want to
take revenge with is...

187
00:18:15,453 --> 00:18:17,785
Not revenge. It is give and take.

188
00:18:19,424 --> 00:18:23,383
Release our man and
we will free you.

189
00:18:24,629 --> 00:18:29,157
Who is that... man of yours?

190
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,092
Sit there quietly. Do
not ask questions...

191
00:18:33,171 --> 00:18:35,469
...or your mouth will be sealed.

192
00:19:06,137 --> 00:19:08,071
Don't be afraid. I am not
touching your legs...

193
00:19:08,139 --> 00:19:10,801
...just tying them up.

194
00:19:12,577 --> 00:19:13,635
Can't you leave them
open for sometime?

195
00:19:13,711 --> 00:19:16,305
No, there are no orders.

196
00:19:17,415 --> 00:19:18,473
Whose orders?

197
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,342
Guru's!

198
00:19:24,422 --> 00:19:25,787
I want to walk for sometime.

199
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,359
I am not going to run away, ok?

200
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:40,103
For the last three days
I am being dragged...

201
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:43,834
...from here to there. Why?
What have I done?

202
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,104
Am I a criminal? Am I a criminal...

203
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,306
...that you are treating
me like a bloody...

204
00:19:50,381 --> 00:19:54,340
Shut up! Shut up! No hysteria,
you understand!

205
00:19:55,186 --> 00:19:57,177
There is no runway here for
you to walk in leisure.

206
00:20:45,736 --> 00:20:52,403
'Hi! I am sorry. There
is no horn! 0177

207
00:20:54,245 --> 00:20:57,703
What? - I said there is
no horn in this plane. I am sorry.

208
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,675
I know.

209
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:08,284
By the way; I am Aditya.
- What?

210
00:21:09,193 --> 00:21:12,856
I said my name is Aditya.
But you can call me Adi.

211
00:21:13,631 --> 00:21:15,121
I am Panna.

212
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:20,194
Hi! Would you like
to spin? Up there.

213
00:21:20,471 --> 00:21:21,529
Where?

214
00:21:21,672 --> 00:21:24,300
Mars. Shall we go to Mars?

215
00:21:25,643 --> 00:21:26,769
In this plane?

216
00:21:27,678 --> 00:21:30,647
Of course! Don't under
estimate this fly.

217
00:21:30,715 --> 00:21:31,773
It can fly really very high.

218
00:21:32,483 --> 00:21:34,383
Come!
- OK.

219
00:21:36,354 --> 00:21:39,221
Hey, this way. This is not
a car. It is a plane.

220
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,348
Ok, ok.

221
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:44,858
Good, come on up! Yes. Ok.

222
00:21:47,498 --> 00:21:49,625
Let's take the seat belt.

223
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:56,501
I am taking up again, I am sorry.

224
00:21:56,574 --> 00:21:57,666
Flight A203 taking off, over!

225
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,503
Ready to fly.

226
00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:25,863
What did you do about our
house in the village?

227
00:22:26,203 --> 00:22:28,797
I closed it down. But I have
kept a watchman. - Ok.

228
00:22:28,873 --> 00:22:31,501
Mr. Barve has also stopped
coming after the floods.

229
00:22:31,575 --> 00:22:32,633
Yes.

230
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,638
Mom! I will meet you in the evening.

231
00:22:35,713 --> 00:22:36,873
I am going to the site.

232
00:22:36,947 --> 00:22:38,209
What is the progress?

233
00:22:38,282 --> 00:22:39,340
Progress is very good.

234
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,451
Two months... in two months,
the structure will be ready.

235
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:43,345
Did you have your breakfast?

236
00:22:43,421 --> 00:22:45,218
Yes, I had my breakfast
and also the milk.

237
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:46,884
You seem to be very happy?

238
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,823
Bye mom. - Bye.

239
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:17,245
What are you doing?

240
00:23:19,457 --> 00:23:20,515
Why do you roam around with the gun...

241
00:23:20,591 --> 00:23:21,785
...like it is your tail, you creep.

242
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,191
Hey, girl. What language do you use?

243
00:23:24,462 --> 00:23:28,728
Why? Don't you use it?
I have heard you.

244
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:32,260
You are a girl.

245
00:23:32,636 --> 00:23:36,595
So?

246
00:23:51,489 --> 00:23:52,547
Give me the keys.

247
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,749
But this vehicle has come
for Diwan sir, baby.

248
00:23:54,825 --> 00:23:57,225
Don't dear me. Just
hand over the keys.

249
00:23:59,363 --> 00:24:00,352
Tell Diwan sir to call
for another car...

250
00:24:00,431 --> 00:24:01,489
...from the party office.

251
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,623
I have to go back to the Academy.

252
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,758
And this car?

253
00:24:04,668 --> 00:24:09,765
Get in and take it from the
Airport. Hey! The other side.

254
00:24:20,184 --> 00:24:27,113
Come on, Yes, Good, Keep on
moving. Run, run, jump...

255
00:24:27,191 --> 00:24:35,758
...very good, very good, keep on
running, yes, faster! Good, very good

256
00:24:37,468 --> 00:24:40,335
Run fast. Quickly.

257
00:24:42,473 --> 00:24:43,599
That's like...

258
00:24:49,747 --> 00:24:51,271
Who is this man in the plane?

259
00:24:53,484 --> 00:24:55,884
I don't know which scoundrel is that.
He comes here daily.

260
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:57,318
Shut up, don't abuse.

261
00:24:59,323 --> 00:25:02,349
Sir, even you abuse your
juniors in the office.

262
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,154
Okay, fine. Girls, you go now.
Quick. Quick.

263
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:08,787
Sir, why do they always abuse
about mothers and sisters?

264
00:25:09,433 --> 00:25:10,627
Why not about fathers and brothers?

265
00:25:11,602 --> 00:25:13,160
Why is it made for women?

266
00:25:14,171 --> 00:25:15,502
Men are ras... - Shut up!

267
00:25:44,201 --> 00:25:47,466
How can you become a police woman?
You should've slapped that scoundrel.

268
00:25:47,538 --> 00:25:48,596
Calling Ms. Panna. Barve.

269
00:25:50,474 --> 00:25:51,532
Remove the chewing gum
from your mouth...

270
00:25:51,609 --> 00:25:52,667
...and then come.

271
00:26:30,681 --> 00:26:32,342
Why did you have to lock
your horns with him?

272
00:26:32,483 --> 00:26:34,576
That Jyoti is a simpleton.

273
00:26:34,652 --> 00:26:36,119
If she is such a simple girl then...

274
00:26:36,186 --> 00:26:37,448
...what is she doing
in the police force?

275
00:26:38,188 --> 00:26:41,385
Yes, she has gone crazy.
I told her the same.

276
00:26:42,459 --> 00:26:43,517
But I am determined to remove...

277
00:26:43,594 --> 00:26:44,652
...that Jogle from the place.

278
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:47,390
Is it? What will you tell
your mother then?

279
00:26:49,633 --> 00:26:51,123
What happened?
- It is hurting a lot.

280
00:26:51,201 --> 00:26:52,259
Please land the plane, Adi.

281
00:26:53,203 --> 00:26:54,864
There is a highway down.
Shall I land the plane?

282
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,698
Yes, If you land it, then
I will accept you as great.

283
00:26:57,775 --> 00:26:59,208
Sure?
- Yes.

284
00:26:59,276 --> 00:27:02,211
Sure? You are asking
for trouble, Panna!

285
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,337
Yes, I am sure.

286
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:11,378
Ok, here we go, here we go buddy.

287
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,598
Adi, take care of that vehicle.

288
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:26,829
Yes, I can see that.

289
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:43,313
Adi, the trees! There
are so many of them.

290
00:27:43,387 --> 00:27:45,651
Why are you afraid now?
You only told me to land.

291
00:27:55,332 --> 00:27:57,129
Truck! There is a truck.

292
00:27:57,201 --> 00:27:58,395
Yes, I know.

293
00:28:31,435 --> 00:28:33,426
Ok.

294
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,273
Adi, the goats!

295
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,510
If you want, you can
go play with them.

296
00:28:55,592 --> 00:28:57,321
Yes!

297
00:29:20,484 --> 00:29:23,476
Plotter! Platter! Plotter!
Platter!

298
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:27,147
A girl goes around
splashing the water.

299
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,290
Plotter! Platter! Plotter!
Platter!

300
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:39,695
A girl goes around
splashing the water.

301
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:46,369
I have seen a girl going
into the coming waves.

302
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:49,172
Plotter! Platter! Plotter!
Platter!

303
00:29:49,446 --> 00:29:52,643
Sometimes I like what you say.

304
00:29:52,716 --> 00:29:55,514
Plotter! Platter! Plotter!
Platter!

305
00:29:56,186 --> 00:29:59,178
Sometimes I like what you say.

306
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:05,627
Say once again, a girl going
into the coming waves.

307
00:30:24,681 --> 00:30:30,415
Will keep on searching
for you on these shores.

308
00:30:31,221 --> 00:30:36,591
Don't let your footmarks
wash away.

309
00:30:37,494 --> 00:30:38,791
No.

310
00:30:41,331 --> 00:30:46,701
Will keep on searching
for you on these shores.

311
00:30:47,671 --> 00:30:52,506
Don't let your footmarks
wash away.

312
00:30:54,378 --> 00:30:57,575
The ocean in his sleep will
also start thinking.

313
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:00,708
The ocean will ask the
people roaming around.

314
00:31:00,784 --> 00:31:02,809
Hold on for a second...

315
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:10,593
Has anybody seen a girl going
into the coming waves?

316
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:13,653
Plotter
- Platter, Plotter - Platter

317
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:17,188
Sometimes I like what you say

318
00:31:17,267 --> 00:31:19,861
Plotter! Platter! Plotter! Platter!

319
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:33,343
The ships are swaying
with the breeze.

320
00:31:33,417 --> 00:31:36,215
The ships are swaying
with the breeze.

321
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,158
The ships are swaying
with the breeze.

322
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:49,393
The ships are swaying
with the breeze.

323
00:32:06,183 --> 00:32:10,313
Kept on writing to you everyday.

324
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:17,793
But never sent you those letters
filled with desire.

325
00:32:19,463 --> 00:32:20,657
Never, Never!

326
00:32:22,633 --> 00:32:26,797
Kept on writing to you everyday.

327
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:34,470
But never sent you those letters
filled with desire.

328
00:32:35,712 --> 00:32:39,204
Read those letters someday
with your glasses on.

329
00:32:39,283 --> 00:32:42,411
Retain them safely in the
tears of your eyes.

330
00:32:42,486 --> 00:32:45,353
You will find me sitting
in your eyes.

331
00:32:46,356 --> 00:32:52,317
Has anybody seen a girl going
into the coming waves?

332
00:32:52,396 --> 00:32:55,229
Plotter! Platter! Plotter!
Platter!

333
00:32:55,499 --> 00:32:58,627
A girl goes around
splashing the water.

334
00:32:58,702 --> 00:33:01,466
Plotter! Platter! Plotter!
Platter!

335
00:33:01,538 --> 00:33:05,099
A girl goes around
splashing the water.

336
00:33:05,175 --> 00:33:11,671
I have seen a girl going
into the coming waves.

337
00:33:11,748 --> 00:33:14,342
Plotter! Platter! Plotter!
Platter!

338
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:17,781
Sometimes I like what you say.

339
00:33:17,854 --> 00:33:20,721
Plotter! Platter! Plotter!
Platter!

340
00:33:21,191 --> 00:33:24,854
I have seen a girl going
into the coming waves.

341
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:43,204
I am seeing you reading the
newspaper for the first time.

342
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:48,144
You have never even
bothered to read...

343
00:33:48,218 --> 00:33:49,378
...the newspaper to see your results.

344
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,387
I was reading the result of
the strike in your mill.

345
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:59,152
Its 40 days now. The hamlet
which had been emptied...

346
00:33:59,229 --> 00:34:05,099
...yesterday, are located
behind our mills.

347
00:34:05,602 --> 00:34:07,331
That land belongs to us.

348
00:34:08,438 --> 00:34:16,106
Yes papa. I was just saying
that the way those hamlets...

349
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:24,814
...were burnt... they got burnt...
it was not right. - So?

350
00:34:27,624 --> 00:34:36,794
Papa... papa those people...
who... work for you.

351
00:34:38,468 --> 00:34:43,132
Papa, they have many faces,
you think you...

352
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:49,736
...control them, but eventually
they are going to control you.

353
00:34:51,481 --> 00:34:54,211
Papa, they have surrounded
you from all sides.

354
00:34:54,651 --> 00:34:55,709
Papa... papa those people...

355
00:34:55,786 --> 00:34:57,879
Don't teach me my business.

356
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:03,821
Ok papa, Ok.

357
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,374
I heard you went to that locality?

358
00:35:19,176 --> 00:35:25,547
Yes. I had. To meet my school
teacher, Master Joshi.

359
00:35:26,716 --> 00:35:29,412
His condition is very bad,

360
00:35:31,688 --> 00:35:33,849
I tried to offer him
some monetary help.

361
00:35:35,325 --> 00:35:38,192
But he refused. You know how he is.

362
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:41,822
Yes, I know him. He is a bloody fool.

363
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:46,393
I told him 50 times that I can
place him somewhere else.

364
00:35:46,703 --> 00:35:49,866
But he doesn't want to
betray his union.

365
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,631
But he just wants to
run his dads union.

366
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:55,735
He is also going to
suffer like his dad.

367
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:02,809
Papa, you really want him
to leave those people?

368
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,478
His own people?

369
00:36:04,554 --> 00:36:05,714
Can you make him understand?

370
00:36:06,423 --> 00:36:09,085
Tell him that hunger
and unemployment...

371
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:11,821
...spreads illness,
and not revolution.

372
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,355
Yes papa.

373
00:36:17,601 --> 00:36:21,093
I know you are very attached
with him and he too is also...

374
00:36:21,171 --> 00:36:25,107
...very attached to you. I have
never told him anything...

375
00:36:25,175 --> 00:36:28,838
...because his wife has taken
care of you a lot.

376
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:33,343
Anyway, I have solution
for such stubborn people.

377
00:36:34,451 --> 00:36:35,509
Yes papa.

378
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:42,554
Papa that... what... What is this?

379
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,518
Lts a pistol.

380
00:36:45,629 --> 00:36:46,755
Why are you keeping it?

381
00:36:47,464 --> 00:36:48,522
Lts yours, papa.

382
00:36:50,467 --> 00:36:52,196
But why are you keeping it

383
00:36:52,269 --> 00:36:54,533
I am not keeping it,
was just seeing it.

384
00:36:55,205 --> 00:36:56,263
Should I keep it, papa?

385
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,331
What will you do with it?

386
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:04,369
Just for security purpose.

387
00:37:06,149 --> 00:37:07,207
What threat do you have?

388
00:37:07,284 --> 00:37:11,414
If somebody kidnaps me, then
you might face danger.

389
00:37:13,423 --> 00:37:15,789
Nobody would kidnap
a liability like you.

390
00:37:21,665 --> 00:37:28,594
Papa... papa, my teacher
is a very honest person.

391
00:37:31,308 --> 00:37:35,438
But if his own people ditch him,
then would those people...

392
00:37:35,512 --> 00:37:37,537
You ask too many questions.

393
00:37:38,448 --> 00:37:40,643
This generation has
a lot of questions.

394
00:37:47,691 --> 00:37:49,318
But we never get the answers.

395
00:37:55,465 --> 00:37:56,523
Greetings!

396
00:37:59,636 --> 00:38:01,627
How are you brother?
I hope you are fine.

397
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:08,601
Greetings, brother!
- Greetings!

398
00:38:09,479 --> 00:38:12,573
Hey, you are lifting the bucket,
or is it lifting you?

399
00:38:13,149 --> 00:38:17,779
Give it to me. You go further! Fool!

400
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:25,356
Oh! Oh! Oh! Where are you
going lady? Come this way.

401
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:36,838
Excuse me aunty. Come. Just
right there. Mind your step.

402
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,668
Hello sir.

403
00:38:43,179 --> 00:38:46,307
Oh Aditya, come, come, come!

404
00:38:46,683 --> 00:38:48,617
This is Panna; she is my friend.

405
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:56,119
Ok. I like this very much
about your generation.

406
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:00,786
Girls and guys meet like
friends and comrades.

407
00:39:02,399 --> 00:39:04,060
It was very different in
our times. Forget it!

408
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:05,192
The chapter is closed now.

409
00:39:05,402 --> 00:39:07,461
How it used to be
in your times, sir?

410
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:14,201
I met my aunt's sister's friend
while buying tomatoes.

411
00:39:14,277 --> 00:39:15,335
I just bought her home!

412
00:39:18,415 --> 00:39:20,076
Sir, are you a communist?

413
00:39:20,417 --> 00:39:25,081
Why? Oh! You saw Lenin
and Marx photos.

414
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:26,588
That is why you are asking me?

415
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:32,084
I consider them to be the
greatest revolutionaries...

416
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:34,153
...and thinkers of our times.

417
00:39:35,532 --> 00:39:36,590
And Netaji?

418
00:39:40,437 --> 00:39:42,496
I consider him a very great leader.

419
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,801
If we would have got our freedom
according to his way.

420
00:39:46,376 --> 00:39:47,604
Then you would have been
something different.

421
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:49,236
I would have been something
different.

422
00:39:49,612 --> 00:39:51,807
And our country would have
also been different.

423
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:58,677
Here sir, these are you new glasses.

424
00:40:12,769 --> 00:40:16,296
Oh! This girl looks even more
beautiful with these glasses.

425
00:40:16,473 --> 00:40:17,531
And me, sir?

426
00:40:18,675 --> 00:40:23,544
No! You still look the same.
Like a 9 year old kid.

427
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:25,806
At least now make him grow old, sir.

428
00:40:27,484 --> 00:40:29,884
Why? You want to get married to him?

429
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:39,651
Sir! Sir. Bhau has come outside.

430
00:40:40,497 --> 00:40:45,332
He came here again? He is
addicted to this place now.

431
00:40:46,436 --> 00:40:48,870
These people have kept
him on a pedestal.

432
00:40:48,938 --> 00:40:50,166
Sir, since the strike is going on...

433
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,571
...he comes here to entertain people.

434
00:40:51,641 --> 00:40:54,166
Is strike the time
for entertainment?

435
00:40:54,677 --> 00:40:57,441
No sir, I didn't mean that.
He encourages everybody, sir.

436
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:58,907
He sings revolutionary songs.

437
00:41:00,784 --> 00:41:02,115
If revolution could be achieved
by singing songs...

438
00:41:02,185 --> 00:41:04,517
...we would have achieved
it 50 years back.

439
00:41:05,688 --> 00:41:08,851
These politicians
are pretty strange.

440
00:41:10,193 --> 00:41:13,128
They can't walk themselves
and they are...

441
00:41:13,196 --> 00:41:16,757
...running our nation. Why
don't they just retire?

442
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,498
Everybody retires one day.
Teachers also...

443
00:41:21,471 --> 00:41:24,201
Sir, greetings.

444
00:41:29,646 --> 00:41:31,136
I was saying everybody retires...

445
00:41:31,214 --> 00:41:33,341
...one day or the other.
You also retired.

446
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:37,142
Lawyers, clerks, managers,
businessmen...

447
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:41,156
...industrialists all of
them retire as soon as...

448
00:41:41,224 --> 00:41:44,216
...their next generation is ready.

449
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:50,156
Only politicians don't retire
till they don't die...

450
00:41:50,233 --> 00:41:52,895
...or somebody kills them.

451
00:41:54,704 --> 00:41:55,762
Brother, something is fishy.

452
00:41:56,506 --> 00:41:57,871
Hey brother how is health?

453
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:02,168
Hey don't ask how is health,
ask how is scam?

454
00:42:02,612 --> 00:42:05,172
Scam in everything,
Fraud in everything.

455
00:42:05,682 --> 00:42:07,673
It is written about modern times.

456
00:42:08,184 --> 00:42:09,617
And if it is not written
then we will write it.

457
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,647
Keep at least one eye
open while praying,

00:42:18,761 --> 00:42:24,563

464
00:43:06,442 --> 00:43:08,842
A saint with fake beard and
moustache is corrupt.

475
00:44:14,177 --> 00:44:19,444
This chest with 3 crores
in it is filled with scam.

476
00:44:26,589 --> 00:44:28,853
Border, Fodder, powder scam.

477
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:31,620
Brother, niece, permit, order
everything is a scam.

478
00:44:32,328 --> 00:44:36,822

481
00:45:06,095 --> 00:45:11,328
Seven governors sold themselves
by selling shops.

482
00:45:11,601 --> 00:45:16,561
Ministers made millions
in fodder scams.

483
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:22,635
Oh! Lord.

484
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:28,116
Seven governors sold themselves

00:45:28,451 --> 00:45:33,445
Ministers made millions

486
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,124
They keep on changing parties...

00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:38,592
...and fighting with each other.

488
00:45:38,661 --> 00:45:40,856
Hututu, Hututu, Hututu.

00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:43,597
Hututu, Hututu, Hututu.

490
00:45:43,666 --> 00:45:46,134
They keep their hands somewhere...

Poor people, twinkling stars.

526
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:07,558
Poor people, twinkling stars.

527
00:49:07,637 --> 00:49:12,131
Twinkling stars!

528
00:49:12,208 --> 00:49:13,402
Twinkling stars.

529
00:49:13,476 --> 00:49:14,704
Twinkling stars.

530
00:49:14,777 --> 00:49:18,804
Twinkling stars.

531
00:49:39,302 --> 00:49:40,826
Bhau (Brother) really
made us sad today.

532
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,102
It seems like corruption is
prevalent in every thought...

533
00:49:47,176 --> 00:49:50,839
...and everywhere here.

534
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:55,849
Touch anything and it
sticks to your hands.

535
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:04,688
I see corruption mixing in my blood.

536
00:50:08,197 --> 00:50:13,191
I have also seen it coming.
I have heard its footsteps.

537
00:50:14,203 --> 00:50:16,865
While coming or going, or when
I am climbing the stairs.

538
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:23,269
It literally wanders at
my place like smoke.

539
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,140
And at my place, It comes
along with a turban.

540
00:50:31,721 --> 00:50:34,212
Sawantrao...
- Yes, that one! - Gadre!

541
00:50:35,224 --> 00:50:36,885
Hey, don't abuse.

542
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,418
Why?

543
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:39,552
It doesn't sound good
when you say it.

544
00:50:40,429 --> 00:50:42,158
Do I stink when you kiss me?

545
00:50:43,232 --> 00:50:44,290
Yeah.

546
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:46,559
Then you stop smoking.

547
00:50:46,769 --> 00:50:49,363
First clear the academy,
catch me red handed, arrest me!

548
00:50:49,438 --> 00:50:50,530
And the habit will die itself.

549
00:50:50,606 --> 00:50:53,166
Ok, tell me one thing,
what came first?

550
00:50:53,242 --> 00:50:55,802
Cigarettes or corruption?

551
00:50:58,514 --> 00:50:59,913
Cigarettes came first. - How?

552
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:02,115
Well, cigarettes get you high,
which gives you power.

553
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:04,584
And where there is power,
there is corruption.

554
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,313
So, how was the answer?

555
00:51:06,455 --> 00:51:07,717
Very good!

556
00:51:24,673 --> 00:51:31,875
Daddy. When did you come?

557
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,279
You have become thin.

558
00:51:40,589 --> 00:51:42,750
Where are you coming from so late?

559
00:51:46,629 --> 00:51:48,563
You think there is nobody
who is going to ask you.

560
00:51:51,667 --> 00:51:52,725
Who is going to ask me?

561
00:51:54,637 --> 00:51:56,400
There is no such custom
in this house.

562
00:51:56,839 --> 00:51:57,897
What do you mean?

563
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,299
Mother never asked me?

564
00:52:01,444 --> 00:52:02,843
I have stayed out for
many days before.

565
00:52:04,313 --> 00:52:05,678
Arun stays out the whole night...

566
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:06,840
He is a guy and you are a girl.

567
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:08,110
So what if he is a guy...

568
00:52:12,621 --> 00:52:15,715
Sorry, Sorry.

569
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:24,122
And what about mother? Did
you ask her anything...

570
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:30,298
...when she used go out with
that turbaned man in school?

571
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,137
You just used to pretend
like you were sleeping...

572
00:52:33,209 --> 00:52:34,267
...with the blanket over your head.

573
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:39,141
When he used to pick up mother
from our doorstep...

574
00:52:39,215 --> 00:52:42,150
...to take her on the tour. Did
you bother to ask then, what...

575
00:52:42,218 --> 00:52:45,745
...tour he used to take
mother to? No!

576
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:49,618
You were very happy then.

577
00:52:51,694 --> 00:52:53,161
She used to cover her
head with a veil...

578
00:52:53,229 --> 00:52:56,892
...and touch your feet
everyday, Right?

579
00:53:03,506 --> 00:53:04,837
People from the party
used to laugh, daddy.

580
00:53:06,442 --> 00:53:08,171
I have heard them laugh myself.

581
00:53:11,447 --> 00:53:13,813
They call her Anna's Malti outside.

582
00:53:15,117 --> 00:53:23,582
Not Barve's wife. That Sawantrao...
who Savantrao?

583
00:53:24,727 --> 00:53:28,128
Gadre! Sawantrao Gadre! The
man who is responsible for...

584
00:53:28,197 --> 00:53:31,758
...bringing discipline in this house.

585
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:34,393
Remember this next time.

586
00:53:40,209 --> 00:53:44,873
This slap is not on my face.
It's on your face, daddy.

587
00:54:52,214 --> 00:54:53,272
I am sorry, daddy.

588
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:07,486
I am sorry, daddy.

589
00:55:16,372 --> 00:55:18,806
I don't like to stay here, daddy.

590
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:23,839
I also don't like it.

591
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:34,115
Once you go away to your own home...

592
00:55:34,189 --> 00:55:37,784
...then I too will go back
to my place in Sewree.

593
00:55:50,339 --> 00:55:53,137
This is from where you enter,
there is a lobby...

594
00:55:53,208 --> 00:55:55,870
...the conference room, restrooms
are this side...

595
00:55:58,147 --> 00:55:59,205
Yes, yes, go on.

596
00:55:59,281 --> 00:56:01,078
Conference rooms, this
is your restroom...

597
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:03,243
...mikes, speakers everything.

598
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:06,815
Whatever one wants, press
the button or say it.

599
00:56:08,424 --> 00:56:10,289
Anyway who can say anything
in front of you?

600
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,821
Who is speaking in
front of my mother?

601
00:56:14,096 --> 00:56:15,154
Your glasses, mummy.

602
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:17,325
Well, your mother has
become very stylish.

603
00:56:17,399 --> 00:56:19,333
She only wears contact
lenses when she goes out.

604
00:56:19,401 --> 00:56:20,595
Just leave it.

605
00:56:22,171 --> 00:56:23,229
Did you drop your father
at the station?

606
00:56:24,373 --> 00:56:26,773
Yes, the train was late,
but he got a special compartment.

607
00:56:27,443 --> 00:56:29,308
He will reach comfortably.

608
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:32,272
This time he stayed
with us for a month.

609
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:35,275
And you missed out on 20
days from your academy.

610
00:56:36,118 --> 00:56:37,244
I will cover up for it.

611
00:56:37,319 --> 00:56:39,651
Madam, milk for you. You
missed it in the morning.

612
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:46,325
Have it. Have your milk

613
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:50,191
I will have it. You go.

614
00:56:53,469 --> 00:56:54,527
What were you telling mummy?

615
00:56:55,637 --> 00:56:57,502
I have set up a conference
room for mother.

616
00:56:59,341 --> 00:57:01,206
Have you ever seen mummy
addressing a conference?

617
00:57:02,077 --> 00:57:03,476
She looks like a queen.

618
00:57:04,613 --> 00:57:10,347
She is a queen. As it is rulers
are either kings or queens.

619
00:57:11,086 --> 00:57:12,144
What do you mean?

620
00:57:13,288 --> 00:57:17,088
Mummy, that Bhau always
says that the caps and...

621
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:20,151
...crowns are the same, only
the heads have changed.

622
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:23,762
Kings and queens will always
be visible to us.

623
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,092
They have the same style but
the only difference was...

624
00:57:26,168 --> 00:57:28,830
...they had the states, and
now they have estates.

625
00:57:29,171 --> 00:57:30,297
Then they had a lot of courage...

626
00:57:30,372 --> 00:57:31,566
...and now they have a lot of wealth.

627
00:57:33,175 --> 00:57:34,642
You are becoming manner
less day by day.

628
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:36,436
Why are you interfering?

629
00:57:37,446 --> 00:57:38,845
You are making your five star hotel.

630
00:57:39,181 --> 00:57:41,706
Just be happy with it. Be happy!

631
00:57:42,518 --> 00:57:47,114
I am observing that since you
started watching that Bhau's...

632
00:57:47,189 --> 00:57:49,657
...theatre, your language
has become too sweet.

633
00:57:50,659 --> 00:57:52,854
First, register your name
here and then go inside.

634
00:57:53,462 --> 00:57:54,861
I already registered there.

635
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:56,295
So do it once more here.

636
00:57:56,465 --> 00:57:58,126
Hey brother, the complainant
used to reach the court...

637
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,395
...of King Jehangir, just
by striking the bell.

638
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,536
Tell your Queen I am here.

639
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:03,730
Listen! Listen to me!

640
00:58:05,641 --> 00:58:07,404
Think of the devil and the...

641
00:58:08,143 --> 00:58:11,203
Come, Bhau come. Who can stop you?

642
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,542
Yes, I was telling him the same.

643
00:58:13,148 --> 00:58:15,139
Where the sun can't reach,
the poet reaches there.

644
00:58:16,418 --> 00:58:18,079
I am a postman. I sometimes
get letters...

645
00:58:18,153 --> 00:58:20,781
...sometimes I get telegrams.

646
00:58:20,856 --> 00:58:22,585
Sometimes try to get a
money order too, Bhau.

647
00:58:22,658 --> 00:58:26,150
I will, I will. I will get
you the actual notes.

648
00:58:26,428 --> 00:58:28,623
But why do you need money?

649
00:58:29,598 --> 00:58:30,724
Mom, I will take your leave.

650
00:58:31,366 --> 00:58:32,526
I have a meeting with Mr. Sawantrao.

651
00:58:32,601 --> 00:58:36,662
Sawantrao! The kingmaker.
Sorry, the queen maker.

652
00:58:37,172 --> 00:58:39,640
He is the one who brought
her to the field.

653
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:43,100
What madam? You are building
a five star hotel...

654
00:58:43,178 --> 00:58:44,577
...along with Gadre?

655
00:58:47,316 --> 00:58:50,479
The kings used to make rest
houses for travellers.

656
00:58:51,353 --> 00:58:53,446
Drinking water facilities
for the thirsty.

657
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,647
You put up a water pump or
a tap for the poor people.

658
00:58:56,725 --> 00:58:57,851
They will bless you.

659
00:58:59,461 --> 00:59:03,522
It has been fifty years now
you couldn't provide water.

660
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,793
Your government can't
provide us with food.

661
00:59:07,402 --> 00:59:08,630
At least build a public urinal.

662
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,571
Poor people go and sit
on the roadside.

663
00:59:13,141 --> 00:59:15,075
The kings used to build monuments,
but you don't...

664
00:59:15,143 --> 00:59:16,576
...have to do that, the common
man will build it.

665
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:23,640
Tell me, Bhau, what brings you here?

666
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:26,745
What should I call you?
Sister or madam?

667
00:59:27,155 --> 00:59:28,622
Call me anything that you wish to.

668
00:59:29,157 --> 00:59:31,091
Ok, madam you are laying
the tracks at Harad...

669
00:59:31,159 --> 00:59:32,421
...for the good of the people.

670
00:59:32,494 --> 00:59:34,587
Then why don't you understand
their sentiments?

671
00:59:35,163 --> 00:59:37,825
I am not laying those tracks.
That is the work of the centre.

672
00:59:38,567 --> 00:59:41,092
The contract is given
to Patel and the...

673
00:59:41,169 --> 00:59:43,569
...sub contract to Garde
sir for the area.

674
00:59:43,639 --> 00:59:46,107
I am talking about that
same area which is the...

675
00:59:46,174 --> 00:59:48,108
...constituency of Kashigar,
the place where the train...

676
00:59:48,176 --> 00:59:50,440
...passes has a small village
of the backward class.

677
00:59:51,313 --> 00:59:53,304
You would uproot it; but
who would replace them?

678
00:59:54,383 --> 00:59:56,510
It is a village; there
are people who breathe.

679
00:59:56,585 --> 00:59:59,816
It is not a pile of mud that you can
lift from here and throw it there.

680
01:00:00,622 --> 01:00:03,250
We will give! We are going
to rehabilitate them.

681
01:00:03,325 --> 01:00:07,318
One more thing! There also
resides an old mosque.

682
01:00:08,463 --> 01:00:09,521
See to it that it does
not lead to riots...

683
01:00:09,598 --> 01:00:10,860
...among the Hindus and the Muslims.

684
01:00:12,634 --> 01:00:14,124
As it is the politicians
have created...

685
01:00:14,202 --> 01:00:15,260
...a lot of tension in the country.

686
01:00:15,337 --> 01:00:18,864
Bhau, you do your work
and let us do ours!

687
01:00:18,941 --> 01:00:20,875
I am not stopping you
from doing your work.

688
01:00:21,777 --> 01:00:24,541
But when it comes to people's
welfare, it becomes my work.

689
01:00:25,347 --> 01:00:26,405
When law and order...

690
01:00:26,481 --> 01:00:29,450
Law and order is our responsibility.

691
01:00:29,518 --> 01:00:31,884
And when need be, you break it too.

692
01:00:35,223 --> 01:00:36,884
I am late; I have to
go to the office.

693
01:00:37,492 --> 01:00:38,891
Madam, I am not rebelling
against you.

694
01:00:39,728 --> 01:00:44,165
I come along because
we used to stay...

695
01:00:44,232 --> 01:00:49,795
...in the same village. Anyway,
madam I respect you.

696
01:00:59,481 --> 01:01:02,541
Bhau!
- What is it?

697
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:05,848
Bhau... Bhau, you stay at Sewree?

698
01:01:06,455 --> 01:01:07,683
No! I used to stay there.

699
01:01:08,457 --> 01:01:10,118
I used to stay there when
I was very small...

700
01:01:10,192 --> 01:01:11,591
...and you were much more smaller.

701
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:15,118
My father was a peon
in the same school...

702
01:01:15,197 --> 01:01:18,462
...where madam used to teach.

703
01:01:19,334 --> 01:01:20,528
Where do you stay now?

704
01:01:21,203 --> 01:01:23,330
Bhamini! Not far from that place.

705
01:01:23,405 --> 01:01:24,565
It is a backward class locality.

706
01:01:27,209 --> 01:01:30,645
Bhau, can you include
me in your group?

707
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:34,210
I can sing and dance a little bit.

708
01:01:35,717 --> 01:01:39,619
Are you crazy? Madam will
hit both you and me.

709
01:01:40,222 --> 01:01:41,587
You are better off in
the police force.

710
01:01:42,724 --> 01:01:44,214
How did you know I am in the police?

711
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:51,292
The world is very small. You can
cover everything. I leave.

712
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,161
If you want to spend your holidays...

713
01:01:53,235 --> 01:01:54,759
...then come to our village.

714
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:05,169
He is a poet; he goes
around with his group.

715
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,843
But I tell you, Adi! Bhau
is a very straight man.

716
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:11,580
Straight and honest.

717
01:02:13,622 --> 01:02:16,785
If our government were to
have men like him then...

718
01:02:19,194 --> 01:02:21,128
Yes, you would dethrone
your mother...

719
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:22,390
...and make Bhau the minister.

720
01:02:24,666 --> 01:02:28,602
Yes, I would. Wait. Yes, yes.

721
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:32,332
Eat! Eat up.

722
01:02:34,476 --> 01:02:35,704
Sir, your dad is calling you.

723
01:02:35,777 --> 01:02:36,869
Yes, I am coming.

724
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:40,579
And do you know, Adi! He is the
only one mom is afraid of.

725
01:02:41,483 --> 01:02:43,883
Because he says what he wants
to without any fear.

726
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:45,777
Not fear! Straightforward!

727
01:02:46,488 --> 01:02:49,389
Whatever it is.

728
01:02:49,458 --> 01:02:50,618
What Panna?

729
01:02:50,692 --> 01:02:52,159
And he has such a great
sense of humour...

730
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:54,161
...he was telling mom that
if your government...

731
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:57,892
...cannot feed people then at least...

732
01:03:00,435 --> 01:03:03,768
What's the use? Sense of
humour does not work.

733
01:03:04,673 --> 01:03:06,664
The meaning of the whole
issue changes.

734
01:03:07,175 --> 01:03:09,666
The poet's thoughts have been
limited to the books.

735
01:03:11,179 --> 01:03:13,113
Only bomb blasts and gun shots...

736
01:03:13,181 --> 01:03:15,445
...make people turn around and look.

737
01:03:15,517 --> 01:03:16,711
Sir, your dad is calling you.

738
01:03:18,186 --> 01:03:19,244
Yes, tell him I am coming

739
01:03:21,323 --> 01:03:25,692
Put my uniform and two sets of
clothes inside the bag. - Ok.

740
01:03:26,461 --> 01:03:28,190
And also my cap.
- Yes!

741
01:03:28,463 --> 01:03:31,193
And also my belt, Madhu. Hello.

742
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:34,201
Sir, your dad is calling you
urgently. - Now what is it?

743
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:35,327
Yes, tell him I am coming,

744
01:03:35,403 --> 01:03:39,134
Ok! Listen; tell him I am having
a bath. Now go! Hello.

745
01:03:39,808 --> 01:03:42,834
Leave the food just to
do the packing, Madhu.

746
01:03:43,211 --> 01:03:44,269
I will have the food later on.

747
01:03:45,147 --> 01:03:46,205
Take.

748
01:03:48,216 --> 01:03:49,274
Hello.

749
01:03:53,155 --> 01:03:55,885
Come lets go.

750
01:03:57,659 --> 01:03:59,786
What the hell is he doing,
let me see.

751
01:04:00,695 --> 01:04:01,753
Take it easy sir.

752
01:04:06,101 --> 01:04:07,159
What were you doing?

753
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:09,228
I was having a bath.

754
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:13,535
Did you see today's newspaper?

755
01:04:15,177 --> 01:04:16,235
No, but why?

756
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:18,802
You must have seen news on T.V. ;
you watch T.V. Isn't it?

757
01:04:23,185 --> 01:04:26,313
It is front-page news.
It is such a big blast.

758
01:04:27,622 --> 01:04:28,850
You did not hear it?

759
01:04:30,192 --> 01:04:31,659
But all this happens everyday, papa.

760
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:34,660
Sometimes in the train.
Sometimes in the bus.

761
01:04:34,729 --> 01:04:37,562
Not in bus or train! There
was a blast in our factory.

762
01:04:37,632 --> 01:04:39,691
The complete melting
wing is destroyed.

763
01:04:39,768 --> 01:04:43,636
In our factory? No dad!
I did not know about it.

764
01:04:44,472 --> 01:04:46,599
But why are you...

765
01:04:47,642 --> 01:04:49,405
Mr. J.D. Tell him about it.

766
01:04:50,212 --> 01:04:51,770
He is the police commissioner
of our area.

767
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:56,215
The people responsible
for the blast know you.

768
01:04:56,484 --> 01:04:58,509
You have been seen with
them in the hamlets.

769
01:04:58,787 --> 01:05:00,345
What are you saying?

770
01:05:01,156 --> 01:05:03,818
I go there, but you
know for what reason?

771
01:05:04,159 --> 01:05:07,754
Are you working with any
underground party?

772
01:05:07,829 --> 01:05:09,694
Against me? Against your dad?

773
01:05:09,764 --> 01:05:10,822
What are you doing dad?

774
01:05:10,899 --> 01:05:13,299
You don't know me very well.

775
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:18,101
Dad, that's enough! Enough!
Anytime, anywhere...

776
01:05:18,173 --> 01:05:23,839
...in front of anyone you can't
start humiliating me.

777
01:05:24,613 --> 01:05:30,176
You don't know me! I can do
anything! I can shoot you too.

778
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:37,116
This empire that I have
created is hard earned...

779
01:05:37,192 --> 01:05:39,854
...and is more precious
to me than you.

780
01:05:39,928 --> 01:05:44,797
I know! This empire of yours
is bigger than us.

781
01:05:48,203 --> 01:05:52,503
Even bigger than my mother,
when she was dying in U.K.

782
01:05:54,209 --> 01:05:56,404
Mr. Joshi was with her and not you.

783
01:05:58,213 --> 01:06:00,681
You were busy with your empire.

784
01:06:04,152 --> 01:06:08,816
You... you have started
back answering me?

785
01:06:23,605 --> 01:06:24,833
Don't get angry, Aditya!

786
01:06:26,775 --> 01:06:28,640
Maybe you are not related
with this issue.

787
01:06:30,312 --> 01:06:33,475
But we have arrested a few people
and they have named you.

788
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:36,106
So please come to the office once.

789
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,582
There's nothing to worry about.

790
01:06:40,188 --> 01:06:41,246
We will handle the issue.

791
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:45,752
I think there was also
a girl with you.

792
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:47,185
Girl also?

793
01:06:47,696 --> 01:06:51,325
We know her; maybe we will call her.

794
01:06:51,466 --> 01:06:52,524
Maybe?

795
01:06:54,669 --> 01:06:55,727
No, we will call her.

796
01:06:57,205 --> 01:07:00,197
You must come to the office
at two tomorrow.

797
01:07:13,421 --> 01:07:19,257
What am I doing here? In this
house! Can you tell me?

798
01:07:22,597 --> 01:07:26,829
I don't care about my dad;
neither does he care.

799
01:07:28,737 --> 01:07:31,365
And there is nobody in that
house who I am attached to.

800
01:07:32,607 --> 01:07:34,768
You at least have your dad.

801
01:07:39,681 --> 01:07:41,706
There are to many questions
bothering me.

802
01:07:44,452 --> 01:07:48,115
He was right when he said
that this generation...

803
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:51,852
...has many questions,
but no answers.

804
01:07:53,628 --> 01:07:59,658
Live in this poisonous and corrupt
atmosphere or else die.

805
01:08:00,635 --> 01:08:03,126
There is no place where
we can exist peacefully.

806
01:08:04,072 --> 01:08:05,130
Adi.

807
01:08:06,408 --> 01:08:13,473
Money, luxury, peace...
do I have peace?

808
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:16,481
I feel suffocated in
such an atmosphere.

809
01:08:17,585 --> 01:08:24,616
I am just existing; just
counting my time.

810
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:39,264
Hey! I am sorry! When are you
supposed to go the academy?

811
01:08:40,108 --> 01:08:41,166
Tomorrow.

812
01:08:42,444 --> 01:08:46,813
Shall we go now, right now?
We will reach by morning.

813
01:08:48,183 --> 01:08:49,582
What say?
- And luggage?

814
01:08:50,452 --> 01:08:54,252
Luggage! I will get it by
the plane and drop it.

815
01:08:54,589 --> 01:08:58,252
The way you drop arms. Same way.

816
01:08:58,326 --> 01:09:03,320
What say! It is a good idea,
what? What? What?

817
01:09:05,733 --> 01:09:11,069
Take such a long smoke that you
will almost instantly die.

818
01:09:13,708 --> 01:09:19,271
Life will be livelier but
there will be no sorrows.

819
01:09:24,419 --> 01:09:29,823
Take such a long smoke that you
will almost instantly die.

820
01:09:32,427 --> 01:09:38,161
Light up life and remove
the sorrows.

821
01:09:38,233 --> 01:09:47,540
Friends, Friends.

822
01:09:48,443 --> 01:09:58,785
Friends, Friends.

823
01:10:04,192 --> 01:10:09,289
Take such a long smoke that you
will almost instantly die.

824
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:14,696
Light up life and remove
the sorrows.

825
01:10:14,769 --> 01:10:20,139
Friends, Friends.

826
01:10:20,208 --> 01:10:24,872
Friends, Friends.

827
01:10:51,739 --> 01:10:55,607
There is something burning
in my heart. Maybe

828
01:10:57,378 --> 01:11:00,814
I feel there is some smoke.

829
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:05,550
Here is something that
pricks my eyes.

830
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:12,856
Maybe, there is some
dream burning.

831
01:11:13,194 --> 01:11:15,458
There is something
burning in my heart.

832
01:11:15,530 --> 01:11:19,762
Maybe I feel there is some smoke.

833
01:11:21,302 --> 01:11:23,133
There is something
that pricks my eyes.

834
01:11:23,204 --> 01:11:28,574
Maybe it is some dream
that's burning.

835
01:11:29,210 --> 01:11:33,874
Burn the heart so much that
the sorrows will all melt.

836
01:11:34,215 --> 01:11:39,881
Burn the heart so much that
the sorrows will all melt.

837
01:11:42,357 --> 01:11:48,592
Light up life and remove
the sorrows.

838
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:55,494
Friends, Friends.

839
01:11:55,570 --> 01:12:00,598
Friends, Friends.

840
01:12:00,675 --> 01:12:11,347
Friends.

841
01:12:43,418 --> 01:12:48,446
Every night spent
in your company...

842
01:12:48,523 --> 01:12:51,720
...seems so warm and comforting.

843
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:58,158
All those night may not be Silky...

844
01:12:58,232 --> 01:13:03,295
...but they still felt comfortable.

845
01:13:04,439 --> 01:13:09,103
Every night spent
in your company...

846
01:13:09,177 --> 01:13:12,169
...seems so warm and comforting.

847
01:13:12,246 --> 01:13:15,113
All those night may not be Silky...

848
01:13:15,183 --> 01:13:17,777
...but they still felt comfortable.

849
01:13:20,455 --> 01:13:25,449
If the night would
change its position,

850
01:13:25,693 --> 01:13:29,129
If the night would
change its position.

851
01:13:29,197 --> 01:13:32,655
I would almost suffocate to death.

852
01:13:33,468 --> 01:13:40,203
Light up life and remove
the sorrows.

853
01:13:41,476 --> 01:13:46,709
Friends, Friends.

854
01:13:46,781 --> 01:13:51,582
Friends, Friends.

855
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:57,453
Take such a long smoke that you
will almost instantly die.

856
01:13:59,727 --> 01:14:05,723
Light up life and remove
the sorrows.

857
01:14:07,602 --> 01:14:12,539
Friends, Friends.

858
01:14:13,174 --> 01:14:17,372
Friends, Friends.

859
01:14:41,135 --> 01:14:42,261
She was not alone in the car.

860
01:14:44,672 --> 01:14:46,196
Who was the other person with her?

861
01:14:47,642 --> 01:14:50,702
Mr. Patel's son, Mr. P.N. Patel!

862
01:14:51,712 --> 01:14:54,510
Can't say but probably the
car belonged to him.

863
01:14:56,217 --> 01:14:59,482
Both used to go to the flying
club pretty often.

864
01:15:00,421 --> 01:15:01,479
Where is he?

865
01:15:02,156 --> 01:15:03,214
We did not find his body

866
01:15:04,659 --> 01:15:05,819
Body? What does that mean?

867
01:15:05,893 --> 01:15:07,827
We think he has got carried
away in the water.

868
01:15:08,596 --> 01:15:10,086
If he would have been alive...

869
01:15:10,164 --> 01:15:11,290
...we would have surely found him.

870
01:15:36,457 --> 01:15:39,688
Good evening madam!
I am a doctor here!

871
01:15:42,196 --> 01:15:43,595
I have to discuss something
very important with you.

872
01:15:53,341 --> 01:15:56,504
Did you know that your
daughter was pregnant?

873
01:15:57,478 --> 01:15:58,604
She was pregnant.

874
01:16:03,484 --> 01:16:07,147
There was a miscarriage,
and plenty of bleeding too.

875
01:16:10,157 --> 01:16:14,617
The baby must be
10 to 12 weeks old.

876
01:16:16,631 --> 01:16:17,791
Any serious injuries?

877
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:20,358
Not really.

878
01:16:35,449 --> 01:16:36,507
Mother has come?

879
01:16:36,584 --> 01:16:37,642
Yes.

880
01:17:23,164 --> 01:17:30,161
How are you? How are you now?

881
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:32,633
How are you?

882
01:17:34,642 --> 01:17:35,836
Did you come to know
anything about Adi?

883
01:17:39,113 --> 01:17:40,171
Search is on.

884
01:17:51,459 --> 01:17:56,123
Did you get married to, Adi?

885
01:17:57,198 --> 01:17:58,392
Did you get married to

886
01:17:59,467 --> 01:18:00,456
No!

887
01:18:05,139 --> 01:18:06,663
We did not get the ration card made.

888
01:18:08,409 --> 01:18:09,467
What do you mean?

889
01:18:12,279 --> 01:18:15,077
I have seen some marriages
which mean...

890
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:18,312
...nothing more than a ration card.

891
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:20,717
You talk foolishly.

892
01:18:26,427 --> 01:18:28,361
Hey stop! Where do you want to go?

893
01:18:28,429 --> 01:18:29,691
Malti Devi has come here!

894
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:31,722
Have to take a few photographs
and meet her.

895
01:18:31,799 --> 01:18:34,427
Listen she is come here
in personal business

896
01:18:34,502 --> 01:18:36,094
What personal business does
she have in a hospital?

897
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:38,536
I told you, she is here
to meet somebody.

898
01:18:39,106 --> 01:18:40,164
Who is it?

899
01:18:40,241 --> 01:18:42,835
Go. Go away from here, will
you please leave her alone.

900
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:44,168
Get out!

901
01:18:48,582 --> 01:18:52,177
I have to go back to Mumbai.
I have some important work.

902
01:18:52,253 --> 01:18:53,311
Of the country?

903
01:18:55,456 --> 01:18:59,483
Yes, of the country,
which is more urgent.

904
01:19:07,635 --> 01:19:10,229
It will take me some time
for you to shift from here.

905
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:16,074
Whatever I can do and whatever...

906
01:19:16,143 --> 01:19:18,475
...you will allow me
to do will be done.

907
01:19:23,584 --> 01:19:28,146
Mom, was it a girl or a boy?

908
01:19:32,626 --> 01:19:35,754
Nobody tells me whether
it was a boy or a girl.

909
01:19:37,598 --> 01:19:38,656
I don't know.

910
01:19:41,168 --> 01:19:42,226
Didn't you ask?

911
01:19:44,438 --> 01:19:45,496
No.

912
01:20:25,346 --> 01:20:32,582
Take such a long smoke that you
will almost instantly die.

913
01:20:36,223 --> 01:20:43,152
Light up life and remove
the sorrows.

914
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:44,356
Adi.

915
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:56,740
Friends, Friends.

916
01:21:02,183 --> 01:21:03,241
What are you thinking?

917
01:21:04,185 --> 01:21:08,178
Do you know what she asked me?
- What?

918
01:21:08,455 --> 01:21:10,787
About the miscarriage?

919
01:21:12,326 --> 01:21:15,489
Was it a boy or a girl?

920
01:21:17,464 --> 01:21:18,658
What did you want?

921
01:21:20,201 --> 01:21:22,499
You did not let me know; otherwise...

922
01:21:24,672 --> 01:21:29,575
I wanted to tell you but you
were very upset that day.

923
01:21:33,214 --> 01:21:34,647
You had fought with your father.

924
01:21:40,487 --> 01:21:46,357
What did you want? A girl! -

925
01:21:47,228 --> 01:21:50,493
No!
- A boy!

926
01:21:54,501 --> 01:21:55,900
What would she have done living
in such an atmosphere?

927
01:21:57,671 --> 01:21:59,332
In the atmosphere in
which you are living?

928
01:22:01,442 --> 01:22:02,773
In the atmosphere in
which I am living?

929
01:22:03,677 --> 01:22:05,611
You were never so bitter, Adi.

930
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:09,672
No? Don't you remember which
atmosphere I come from?

931
01:22:16,190 --> 01:22:21,651
...My mind still boils with rage
because of those questions.

932
01:22:39,613 --> 01:22:44,880
I don't know whether I was
right in running away.

933
01:22:48,222 --> 01:22:52,522
I don't even know whether
I am right or wrong?

934
01:22:55,663 --> 01:23:00,157
But what I am doing now has
no selfish or corrupt motive.

935
01:23:03,170 --> 01:23:04,831
I am not even ashamed of myself.

936
01:23:15,683 --> 01:23:17,275
What happened to your leg?

937
01:23:30,731 --> 01:23:32,790
When I regained my consciousness
after leaving you.

938
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:51,542
Sir!

939
01:23:51,618 --> 01:23:55,486
Yes! What is it?

940
01:23:55,556 --> 01:23:56,682
Sanju has come.

941
01:23:56,757 --> 01:24:02,491
Alone! - Yes! - Any news?
Come lets go down. Fast!

942
01:24:28,689 --> 01:24:30,179
They have shifted him
from that prison.

943
01:24:31,325 --> 01:24:32,383
Where did they take him?

944
01:24:33,193 --> 01:24:35,184
Could not find it out, sir!
Could not find out!

945
01:24:36,196 --> 01:24:39,256
To find that out Kalyan and
myself were following them.

946
01:24:40,334 --> 01:24:45,135
But the police found out,
and suddenly they fired...

947
01:24:45,205 --> 01:24:51,701
...and Kalyan got shot
and died on the spot.

948
01:24:52,479 --> 01:24:54,140
But do you have any
idea as to where...

949
01:24:54,214 --> 01:24:55,374
...they must have taken him?

950
01:24:55,449 --> 01:24:58,885
Guru thinks that they will
kill him in an encounter.

951
01:25:00,421 --> 01:25:01,820
That means his corpse
will come here.

952
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:09,085
If his dead body comes
here; then one more...

953
01:25:09,163 --> 01:25:12,724
...dead body will go from here.

954
01:25:32,119 --> 01:25:33,177
What is the news?

955
01:25:33,620 --> 01:25:40,458
No! Nothing! You go to
sleep for some time.

956
01:25:42,729 --> 01:25:46,859
Why? Is this the last night for me?

957
01:25:50,204 --> 01:25:51,637
And there is not much time for dawn.

958
01:25:58,479 --> 01:25:59,537
Do you want anything?

959
01:26:03,584 --> 01:26:06,553
Are you asking for my last wish?
- Yes!

960
01:26:14,595 --> 01:26:16,085
You make love to me?

961
01:26:23,437 --> 01:26:24,631
It is not right.

962
01:26:24,705 --> 01:26:29,574
It was not right before also,
or was it something?

963
01:26:31,178 --> 01:26:32,236
Do you want anything?

964
01:26:42,189 --> 01:26:43,247
I want to have a bath.

965
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:54,333
Sanctimony, Faith, Belief,
whose? Of God!

966
01:26:55,636 --> 01:26:58,127
If you believe in him, then
you immediately get divided...

967
01:26:58,205 --> 01:27:01,140
...into religions; this is
Hindu, this is Muslim.

968
01:27:02,576 --> 01:27:05,568
If you believe in ethics, then
you get divided into parties.

969
01:27:08,081 --> 01:27:10,072
For every ethic there
are six parties.

970
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,088
Hasn't Bhau seen riots?

971
01:27:15,522 --> 01:27:17,683
I went for 10 days to Bhau's place.

972
01:27:18,158 --> 01:27:19,216
Mom let you go.

973
01:27:19,293 --> 01:27:21,420
In those days I got my father
back to the village.

974
01:27:21,495 --> 01:27:24,225
Taking his facet she killed
many people. - No!

975
01:27:24,531 --> 01:27:27,091
You don't know below
the railway tracks...

976
01:27:27,167 --> 01:27:29,328
...there lie many graves.

977
01:27:29,403 --> 01:27:34,431
No, this is not true. Mom
can be weak and corrupt...

978
01:27:34,508 --> 01:27:39,104
...but she can't be a murderer.
Sawantrao was...

979
01:27:39,179 --> 01:27:41,272
You don't know what Sawantrao
was for her?

980
01:27:41,348 --> 01:27:44,442
I know, I am aware of it

981
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:47,347
'Who the hell is he, that man!

982
01:27:49,556 --> 01:27:51,615
He may be your C.A. But
he is not my father.

983
01:27:52,693 --> 01:27:54,320
Why is he staying in
my father's room?

984
01:27:55,696 --> 01:27:58,688
That is not your father's room.
It is a guest room.

985
01:27:59,666 --> 01:28:01,065
You have made it a guest room...

986
01:28:01,134 --> 01:28:02,726
...since your husband has become one.

987
01:28:05,439 --> 01:28:07,134
Since he has gone to the
construction site.

988
01:28:07,741 --> 01:28:14,544
Speak softly; I don't send him to
the site, it is his business.

989
01:28:16,516 --> 01:28:17,574
What happened dear?

990
01:28:18,285 --> 01:28:19,547
Why are you upset with your mother?

991
01:28:20,621 --> 01:28:22,145
I am hearing loud voices
from this room.

992
01:28:24,291 --> 01:28:26,759
Mr. Minister or whatever you are!

993
01:28:28,462 --> 01:28:31,556
This is somebody's bedroom,
not a government office.

994
01:28:34,568 --> 01:28:35,626
How did you enter inside?

995
01:28:36,336 --> 01:28:41,137
Oh! I am sorry.

996
01:28:49,149 --> 01:28:50,514
So, he is a guest in our house.

997
01:28:58,125 --> 01:28:59,615
Why did you not run behind
him to apologise?

998
01:29:00,527 --> 01:29:01,721
What if he cuts your name
from the cabinet?

999
01:29:02,129 --> 01:29:06,657
Stop your foolish talks! I am
not interested in flying high.

1000
01:29:08,568 --> 01:29:09,626
I have worked so hard and
come up to this level...

1001
01:29:09,703 --> 01:29:11,068
...so that you people live
a comfortable life...

1002
01:29:11,138 --> 01:29:12,605
...and have a bright future.

1003
01:29:15,075 --> 01:29:16,133
Otherwise what was your status?

1004
01:29:17,477 --> 01:29:18,671
A jaggery maker's daughter?

1005
01:29:21,148 --> 01:29:23,082
You would have got married
by now with ten children...

1006
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:24,481
...running around naked
in the village.

1007
01:29:26,687 --> 01:29:28,484
Everybody likes using power,
and you all do that.

1008
01:29:29,690 --> 01:29:31,214
And I become the culprit.

1009
01:29:33,293 --> 01:29:34,419
I have heard this many times.

1010
01:29:42,769 --> 01:29:49,766
I am going... to that jaggery maker.

1011
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:57,408
There is a lot of tension,
I read it in the newspaper,

1012
01:31:02,616 --> 01:31:05,779
Be Awake, Be awake, Get awake.

1013
01:31:06,253 --> 01:31:09,120
Be Awake, Be awake, Get awake.

1014
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:19,622
Be Awake, Be awake, Get awake.

1015
01:31:20,133 --> 01:31:23,125
Be Awake, Be awake, Get awake.

1016
01:31:23,537 --> 01:31:26,802
Be Awake, Be awake, Get awake.

1017
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:30,473
Be Awake, Be awake, Get awake.

1018
01:31:31,411 --> 01:31:37,316
This dark night is very scary...

1019
01:31:37,384 --> 01:31:40,751
Be Awake, Be awake, Get awake.

1020
01:31:40,821 --> 01:31:43,813
Be Awake, Be awake, Get awake.

1021
01:31:44,424 --> 01:31:47,757
Be Awake, Be awake, Get awake.

1022
01:31:47,828 --> 01:31:51,161
Be Awake, Be awake, Get awake.

1023
01:31:52,265 --> 01:31:59,671
This darkness is like a cobweb,
which people have brought up...

1024
01:32:01,708 --> 01:32:05,109
Be Awake, Be awake, Get awake.

1025
01:32:05,178 --> 01:32:08,614
Be Awake, Be awake, Get awake.

1026
01:32:08,682 --> 01:32:12,118
Be Awake, Be awake, Get awake.

1027
01:32:12,185 --> 01:32:15,279
Be Awake, Be awake, Get awake.

1028
01:32:47,654 --> 01:32:54,150
The honesty is stuck in fire...

1029
01:32:54,661 --> 01:33:00,156
The human is stuck in fire...

1030
01:33:05,138 --> 01:33:11,099
The honesty is stuck in fire...

1031
01:33:11,778 --> 01:33:18,115
The human is stuck in fire...

1032
01:33:18,785 --> 01:33:24,280
When the fire ablaze...
- It is scary...

1033
01:33:25,792 --> 01:33:31,287
When the fire raises...
- It is scary...

1034
01:33:32,732 --> 01:33:42,232
Some people have crushed the
generation of human beings...

1035
01:33:42,309 --> 01:33:45,642
Be Awake, Be awake, Get awake.

1036
01:33:45,712 --> 01:33:48,647
Be Awake, Be awake, Get awake.

1037
01:33:49,215 --> 01:33:52,651
Be Awake, Be awake, Get awake.

1038
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:56,485
Be Awake, Be awake, Get awake.

1039
01:34:52,412 --> 01:34:58,476
There is shame and
there is beheading.

1040
01:34:59,319 --> 01:35:02,083
People get divided and
now even the Gods...

1041
01:35:02,155 --> 01:35:04,589
...are getting divided.

1042
01:35:09,763 --> 01:35:15,599
There is shame and
there is beheading.

1043
01:35:16,603 --> 01:35:20,095
People get divided and
now even the Gods.

1044
01:35:20,173 --> 01:35:22,607
...are getting divided.

1045
01:35:23,610 --> 01:35:29,105
If anybody asks for name...
- There is fear.

1046
01:35:30,450 --> 01:35:35,786
If now anybody asks anyone...
- There is fear.

1047
01:35:37,457 --> 01:35:42,121
How many times those
few people have...

1048
01:35:42,195 --> 01:35:46,791
...hanged me on the noose... '

1049
01:35:47,133 --> 01:35:50,364
Be Awake, Be awake, Get awake.

1050
01:35:50,437 --> 01:35:53,463
Be Awake, Be awake, Get awake.

1051
01:35:53,807 --> 01:35:57,402
Be Awake, Be awake, Get awake.

1052
01:35:57,477 --> 01:36:00,571
Be Awake, Be awake, Get awake.

1053
01:36:01,748 --> 01:36:07,584
This night is very scary...

1054
01:36:41,187 --> 01:36:44,623
I can understand that... I can
understand that he should get it.

1055
01:36:46,326 --> 01:36:48,123
This time the election will
be won by the person...

1056
01:36:48,194 --> 01:36:50,458
...who will be supported by Bhau.

1057
01:36:51,197 --> 01:36:52,721
He has a lot of influence
in this area.

1058
01:36:53,299 --> 01:36:57,292
In the whole area he has more
than 60 percent votes.

1059
01:37:00,473 --> 01:37:01,735
We will do something about, Bhau.

1060
01:37:02,742 --> 01:37:05,472
Bhau! He has a lot of power
over the backward classes.

1061
01:37:06,679 --> 01:37:11,582
To control him is not in
our capacity, yes but...

1062
01:37:11,651 --> 01:37:13,084
Greetings.

1063
01:37:13,153 --> 01:37:15,246
Greetings.

1064
01:37:16,723 --> 01:37:20,750
This is Maltibai. Get to know
her properly, Bholekaka.

1065
01:37:21,761 --> 01:37:22,819
Who does not know her?

1066
01:37:23,429 --> 01:37:26,762
Now she will only come with
the party belongings.

1067
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:29,491
I won't be free from the party work.

1068
01:37:30,570 --> 01:37:32,094
So we will leave then, Mr.
Sawantrao. - Greetings!

1069
01:37:32,172 --> 01:37:34,766
Greetings!
- We are going, madam.

1070
01:37:36,776 --> 01:37:37,834
Greetings!

1071
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:41,738
Who were these people?

1072
01:37:43,449 --> 01:37:45,212
They were people from
your constituency.

1073
01:37:45,285 --> 01:37:46,775
What do you mean by my constituency?

1074
01:37:49,189 --> 01:37:52,124
Madam, this time you fight
a big election...

1075
01:37:52,192 --> 01:37:55,286
...from our constituency.

1076
01:37:56,462 --> 01:37:59,124
Diwan sir!
- Yes, sir! - Bring those papers.

1077
01:37:59,465 --> 01:38:01,763
Why from your constituency?
Not mine?

1078
01:38:04,170 --> 01:38:07,071
Madam, smart leaders never
fight elections...

1079
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:09,074
...from their own constituency.

1080
01:38:09,609 --> 01:38:11,668
People know them very well there.

1081
01:38:12,579 --> 01:38:14,069
When they start criticising,
they also count...

1082
01:38:14,147 --> 01:38:16,274
...the illnesses of their children.

1083
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:20,185
It is very difficult to hide
the truth from our people.

1084
01:38:21,454 --> 01:38:22,512
Take this, sir!

1085
01:38:25,191 --> 01:38:26,317
Sign in these two places.

1086
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:28,520
Diwan sir!
- Yes!

1087
01:38:28,595 --> 01:38:30,085
Prepare the nomination
papers for madam...

1088
01:38:30,163 --> 01:38:32,097
...and make a file.

1089
01:38:32,432 --> 01:38:33,490
Ok sir.

1090
01:38:34,434 --> 01:38:35,492
Thank you.

1091
01:38:36,502 --> 01:38:37,560
Thank you, sir.

1092
01:38:38,805 --> 01:38:41,103
Anna! Is it that because
this Shrirang is safe...

1093
01:38:41,174 --> 01:38:43,108
...you have put me forward.

1094
01:38:43,443 --> 01:38:45,377
What is there to fear? I am there.

1095
01:38:46,279 --> 01:38:48,372
Kashikar is a very strong opponent.

1096
01:38:49,182 --> 01:38:50,376
You will have to work day and night.

1097
01:38:51,217 --> 01:38:53,117
But once you win this election...

1098
01:38:53,186 --> 01:38:57,122
...the next step would be that
of the chief minister!

1099
01:39:00,493 --> 01:39:08,059
Anna! Kashikar is a bit shaken,
but what about Bhau?

1100
01:39:10,436 --> 01:39:12,597
Don't worry; we will take care
of him. It is all in the game!

1101
01:39:14,073 --> 01:39:15,131
Ok.

1102
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:23,075
Madam, when you had come to our
hamlet for the first time...

1103
01:39:23,149 --> 01:39:27,552
...to put up electricity,
I had seen you.

1104
01:39:27,620 --> 01:39:30,282
Your face was glowing;
the light had lit.

1105
01:39:32,325 --> 01:39:34,088
Then you came to put up water taps...

1106
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:35,422
...your head was held high!

1107
01:39:37,263 --> 01:39:43,099
We were under the impression
that she was proud...

1108
01:39:43,169 --> 01:39:50,268
...and happy with us. But no,
you were happy with yourself.

1109
01:39:50,476 --> 01:39:51,534
That you had done these things.

1110
01:39:54,147 --> 01:39:56,445
You were not proud of us,
but your politics.

1111
01:40:00,253 --> 01:40:01,777
Then again two years later,
she came with some...

1112
01:40:01,854 --> 01:40:03,116
...blankets, food grains
and irrigation seeds...

1113
01:40:03,189 --> 01:40:04,247
...for the farmers to be distributed.

1114
01:40:04,324 --> 01:40:06,519
And asked the people to
vote for Gadre's party.

1115
01:40:11,531 --> 01:40:13,123
From then on you got the
hang of the business.

1116
01:40:13,633 --> 01:40:14,827
You started your business.

1117
01:40:23,810 --> 01:40:25,744
This is the money that
your Diwan gave me.

1118
01:40:31,217 --> 01:40:33,481
This is very less to buy me.

1119
01:40:36,756 --> 01:40:38,815
What business will you do madam?

1120
01:40:39,225 --> 01:40:41,284
Sawantrao is a bigger businessman
than you are.

1121
01:40:42,428 --> 01:40:44,419
Your name had been nominated
for party president?

1122
01:40:46,299 --> 01:40:48,324
He will put you straight by
making you run the elections.

1123
01:40:48,668 --> 01:40:50,397
He understands better
business than you do.

1124
01:40:55,608 --> 01:40:57,576
Diwan! Take this away.

1125
01:41:11,791 --> 01:41:16,626
When I was younger, I used
to respect her a lot.

1126
01:41:18,531 --> 01:41:20,123
Thinking that she would
do something for us.

1127
01:41:21,667 --> 01:41:28,129
See what she has done! You
may have forgotten it...

1128
01:41:28,207 --> 01:41:34,146
...but I have not. You had gone
up the roof and broken...

1129
01:41:34,213 --> 01:41:37,740
...the school window
pane. Didn't you?

1130
01:41:39,218 --> 01:41:40,480
I had seen that fire in you.

1131
01:41:44,323 --> 01:41:50,228
We are the cow's dung. All of us.

1132
01:41:51,297 --> 01:41:53,765
We are smouldering quietly under
the burden of History.

1133
01:41:56,436 --> 01:41:59,530
Once at least let someone
burn the pile of history.

1134
01:42:00,173 --> 01:42:06,271
Then we will say; all of us. How
it feels to be like cow dung.

1135
01:42:24,797 --> 01:42:26,526
Vote for Malti Devi.

1136
01:42:30,002 --> 01:42:32,562
Make her win the elections.

1137
01:42:32,872 --> 01:42:35,864
Keep in mind, vote for Malti Devi.

1138
01:42:36,676 --> 01:42:40,077
We are not idiots! They
are trying to bribe us.

1139
01:42:41,013 --> 01:42:48,249
But we are not going to be bribed.
We will fight it out.

1140
01:42:49,222 --> 01:42:52,555
I had told Anna to do
something about Bhau.

1141
01:42:55,228 --> 01:42:56,991
To burn our houses;
to break our houses.

1142
01:42:57,230 --> 01:43:01,894
They think we do not know
who is doing this.

1143
01:43:03,703 --> 01:43:09,573
Maltibai, it is not so easy to win.

1144
01:43:28,027 --> 01:43:29,085
What's your name?

1145
01:43:29,161 --> 01:43:30,526
Gajra Harchunde.

1146
01:43:31,697 --> 01:43:32,755
Gajra Harchunde?

1147
01:43:37,603 --> 01:43:38,797
What's your name?
- Baban Jadhav.

1148
01:43:39,005 --> 01:43:40,063
Baban? Jadhav.

1149
01:43:54,887 --> 01:43:57,583
Oh my God! What to do now?

1150
01:44:11,070 --> 01:44:12,560
It's, intoxicating!

1151
01:44:17,176 --> 01:44:18,768
It's, intoxicating!

1152
01:44:23,582 --> 01:44:24,742
It's, intoxicating!

1153
01:44:25,851 --> 01:44:27,512
It's, intoxicating!

1154
01:44:28,521 --> 01:44:29,681
It's, intoxicating!

1155
01:44:29,755 --> 01:44:30,915
It's, intoxicating!

1156
01:44:30,990 --> 01:44:32,116
It's, intoxicating!

1157
01:44:32,191 --> 01:44:33,522
It's, intoxicating!

1158
01:44:33,793 --> 01:44:40,028
The smell of blood is intoxicating!

1159
01:44:42,935 --> 01:44:49,534
We are our own rulers!

1160
01:44:49,775 --> 01:44:51,037
It's, intoxicating!

1161
01:44:54,747 --> 01:44:56,044
It's, intoxicating!

1162
01:44:59,885 --> 01:45:02,217
It's, intoxicating!

1163
01:45:02,288 --> 01:45:04,756
It's, intoxicating!

1164
01:45:05,224 --> 01:45:08,625
The smell of blood is intoxicating!

1165
01:45:09,562 --> 01:45:14,556
We are our own rulers!

1166
01:45:35,121 --> 01:45:41,026
Time sets everything.
Time is precious...

1167
01:45:42,661 --> 01:45:49,032
Don't go against time.
Time is very powerful...

1168
01:45:50,202 --> 01:45:55,139
Time sets everything.
Time is precious...

1169
01:45:55,207 --> 01:46:00,201
Don't go against time.
Time is very powerful...

1170
01:46:00,279 --> 01:46:02,679
Don't try to... - Catch the wind...

1171
01:46:02,748 --> 01:46:05,046
This is a tornado.
- Don't catch it...

1172
01:46:05,117 --> 01:46:10,077
Don't catch the edge of the axe.
- As it might cut your veins...

1173
01:46:10,156 --> 01:46:15,059
The attack of time is very harsh...

1174
01:46:15,127 --> 01:46:16,560
It's, intoxicating!

1175
01:46:17,029 --> 01:46:21,898
The smell of blood is intoxicating!

1176
01:46:50,930 --> 01:46:52,522
The one who is born from the soil...

1177
01:46:52,598 --> 01:46:55,533
...what is the use burying
them in the soil?

1178
01:46:56,202 --> 01:47:04,041
The one who live with less clothes,
what is the use of giving them shroud?

1179
01:47:05,878 --> 01:47:08,540
Don't burry in the soil...

1180
01:47:08,614 --> 01:47:10,741
We are standing in our locality...

1181
01:47:10,816 --> 01:47:13,546
We've sowed our heart in the soil...

1182
01:47:13,619 --> 01:47:15,814
We grow from the soil...

1183
01:47:15,888 --> 01:47:20,723
The womb, Every womb
here is very strong.

1184
01:47:20,793 --> 01:47:21,885
It's, intoxicating!

1185
01:47:25,631 --> 01:47:26,893
It's, intoxicating!

1186
01:47:30,669 --> 01:47:33,035
It's, intoxicating!

1187
01:47:33,105 --> 01:47:35,665
It's, intoxicating!

1188
01:47:36,108 --> 01:47:40,511
It's, intoxicating!

1189
01:47:40,579 --> 01:47:41,841
It's, intoxicating!

1190
01:47:45,117 --> 01:47:48,917
The smell of blood is intoxicating!

1191
01:47:48,988 --> 01:47:51,513
We are our own rulers!

1192
01:48:16,615 --> 01:48:18,879
This election was held so
That you could lose...

1193
01:48:18,951 --> 01:48:21,010
...and Sawantrao could
benefit from it.

1194
01:48:22,922 --> 01:48:24,549
Then why did you put two
millions when you knew...

1195
01:48:28,961 --> 01:48:30,724
But I realised Sawantrao's
intentions later.

1196
01:48:33,499 --> 01:48:36,491
I was helping you both;
you know about it.

1197
01:48:38,504 --> 01:48:40,904
Now he is feeling insecure with
your growing popularity.

1198
01:48:42,107 --> 01:48:44,507
Right now I am feeling unsecured
because he is the...

1199
01:48:44,577 --> 01:48:47,740
...chief minister and a member
of the working committee.

1200
01:48:47,947 --> 01:48:50,177
Then why don't try becoming
the chief minister?

1201
01:48:51,917 --> 01:48:56,183
Until Sawantrao is there...
if he would not be there...

1202
01:48:57,656 --> 01:49:00,523
Yes, if he would not
have been there...

1203
01:49:00,593 --> 01:49:02,891
But just check it out...

1204
01:49:03,596 --> 01:49:04,654
What should I check out?

1205
01:49:05,564 --> 01:49:08,590
What can say, who is planning what?

1206
01:49:08,667 --> 01:49:09,929
And who is conspiring against whom?

1207
01:49:10,102 --> 01:49:11,160
True.

1208
01:49:12,705 --> 01:49:14,104
Don't go near the edge.

1209
01:49:18,944 --> 01:49:22,539
Both are in danger.

1210
01:49:28,954 --> 01:49:31,479
'Chief minister Sawantrao
Gadre who had gone...

1211
01:49:31,557 --> 01:49:34,685
...to Bhilpur village
for a farmers rally.'

1212
01:49:35,194 --> 01:49:37,492
'Has been badly injured
in the guest house...

1213
01:49:37,563 --> 01:49:39,724
...because of a malfunctioning
geyser.'

1214
01:49:40,165 --> 01:49:42,656
'This incident happened
at 4 in the evening...

1215
01:49:42,735 --> 01:49:46,967
...when he came back for an
interview at his guesthouse.'

1216
01:49:48,507 --> 01:49:52,841
Hold the stretcher. Be careful!

1217
01:49:52,911 --> 01:49:55,903
'Right now he is in a
critical condition.'

1218
01:50:02,921 --> 01:50:05,515
'Since there is no matching
blood in his...

1219
01:50:05,591 --> 01:50:09,220
...relief ambulance his
life is in danger.'

1220
01:50:10,195 --> 01:50:13,062
'And food minister Narayan
Rao Desmukh has said... '

1221
01:50:24,910 --> 01:50:25,968
Mom, did you get the news?

1222
01:50:26,812 --> 01:50:28,905
They are taking him to some
big city nearby by train.

1223
01:50:28,981 --> 01:50:33,145
Which city? Which hospital?

1224
01:50:33,218 --> 01:50:34,480
Don't know, As soon
as I come to know...

1225
01:50:34,553 --> 01:50:35,611
...I will let you know.

1226
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:49,558
Yes Mr. Patel!

1227
01:50:49,635 --> 01:50:53,162
The flying express passes
from there in five minutes.

1228
01:50:54,073 --> 01:50:59,705
They are trying to stop it, so that
they can reach the city fast.

1229
01:50:59,778 --> 01:51:00,836
Do something.

1230
01:51:01,513 --> 01:51:05,506
You don't worry; Karanth is there.

1231
01:51:19,865 --> 01:51:22,663
Move! Move! Move! Please move.

1232
01:51:44,490 --> 01:51:46,549
Mr. Karanth he is bleeding too much.

1233
01:51:46,625 --> 01:51:48,490
If this is his condition then,
Anna won't survive.

1234
01:51:49,161 --> 01:51:52,824
What shall we do? We will get
the clearance then only...

1235
01:51:53,098 --> 01:51:54,156
But...

1236
01:52:13,652 --> 01:52:18,555
Until he was bleeding, they
didn't let the train pass.

1237
01:52:20,626 --> 01:52:23,595
It was a scheme. It was a plan.

1238
01:52:24,997 --> 01:52:27,522
In which Mr. Patel, your mom, and...

1239
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:30,534
...your brother was involved.

1240
01:52:32,604 --> 01:52:34,538
Maltibai losing that election,
proved...

1241
01:52:34,606 --> 01:52:36,938
...to be very costly for Sawantrao.

1242
01:52:40,779 --> 01:52:42,110
New rules for the game
were being planned.

1243
01:52:44,616 --> 01:52:46,607
New forces were being established.

1244
01:52:48,954 --> 01:52:50,683
Now who could stop Maltibai?

1245
01:52:52,558 --> 01:52:59,259
Now there was only one thorn; Bhau!

1246
01:52:59,331 --> 01:53:00,559
The way a man sheds his old
clothes and wears new ones.

1247
01:53:24,823 --> 01:53:27,519
Now, Maltibai can handle everything.

1248
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:29,727
We have to choose her immediately.

1249
01:53:30,929 --> 01:53:32,794
By this we will be able to
retain the rules of the party...

1250
01:53:34,833 --> 01:53:37,597
We will call for
a meeting and elect her.

1251
01:53:38,871 --> 01:53:40,736
Brother Dheeraj
may object this.

1252
01:53:43,709 --> 01:53:46,542
I'll invite him home in
the evening and convince him.

1253
01:53:48,046 --> 01:53:49,638
We will give him whatever
position he wants.

1254
01:53:51,683 --> 01:53:53,548
I don't think he is going
to compromise.

1255
01:53:55,621 --> 01:53:56,952
He has to compromise.

1256
01:53:58,724 --> 01:53:59,952
We will pay him for that.

1257
01:54:01,093 --> 01:54:04,551
Sister-in-law, you are
his wife legally.

1258
01:54:06,164 --> 01:54:07,756
You have to get your rights.

1259
01:54:09,134 --> 01:54:10,658
For the post of chief minister,
you... - Look brother...

1260
01:54:10,736 --> 01:54:15,070
I don't know anything about politics.

1261
01:54:19,645 --> 01:54:20,976
I don't know anything about politics.

1262
01:54:21,713 --> 01:54:23,078
It is not necessary for
you to know that.

1263
01:54:24,116 --> 01:54:25,583
If people are going on tour...

1264
01:54:26,118 --> 01:54:28,586
...they leave their wife's behind
to take care of their work.

1265
01:54:29,688 --> 01:54:32,521
You can give a try.
We all are with you.

1266
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:42,658
Give him the post...

1267
01:54:44,536 --> 01:54:46,595
He wants to become a chief minister.

1268
01:54:51,543 --> 01:54:52,601
Ok. I'll leave now.

1269
01:54:52,945 --> 01:54:54,606
J.D. What did you do about Bhau?

1270
01:54:55,681 --> 01:54:57,581
I am trying to do something.

1271
01:54:58,617 --> 01:55:03,554
How can he sleep peacefully...
after...

1272
01:55:03,622 --> 01:55:07,615
...making me lose the elections?

1273
01:55:09,728 --> 01:55:13,220
Even if these people elect me;
he will create problems.

1274
01:55:15,233 --> 01:55:16,564
I will once again stand
for elections...

1275
01:55:16,635 --> 01:55:19,832
...from Anna's constituency.

1276
01:55:24,176 --> 01:55:25,507
Yes, you have to do that.

1277
01:55:27,179 --> 01:55:29,613
You will have the benefit
of the sympathy votes too.

1278
01:55:31,516 --> 01:55:32,642
You make the preparations

1279
01:55:33,585 --> 01:55:34,643
Ok.

1280
01:55:35,620 --> 01:55:38,521
Remember! I don't want to
see anybody walking...

1281
01:55:38,590 --> 01:55:42,754
...on two legs in Bhau's
area. Remove him!

1282
01:55:44,129 --> 01:55:45,858
Remove the root cause
of all the problems.

1283
01:55:46,064 --> 01:55:49,727
Not now, Mom!
- Ok!

1284
01:56:01,046 --> 01:56:08,145
Where does Bhau live? Bhau!

1285
01:56:11,189 --> 01:56:12,554
What work do you have with Bhau?

1286
01:56:12,824 --> 01:56:15,952
Can't I come? You called me once.

1287
01:56:16,028 --> 01:56:19,225
Yes, I had called you, But you
would obey me and come...

1288
01:56:19,698 --> 01:56:24,260
...I don't believe that.
Come. What happened?

1289
01:56:26,038 --> 01:56:31,032
I heard a few bad rumours,
so I came to see you.

1290
01:56:32,210 --> 01:56:34,508
Hey nothing will happen
to your Bhau.

1291
01:56:35,847 --> 01:56:37,508
In a few days time our Maltibai
is going to become...

1292
01:56:37,582 --> 01:56:41,177
...the chief minister, then
there will be no problems.

1293
01:56:44,623 --> 01:56:46,181
Come on hide your face, otherwise
your face will become dirty.

1294
01:56:46,792 --> 01:56:48,054
What are you doing?

1295
01:56:48,794 --> 01:56:50,523
I am cleaning my own street.

1296
01:56:50,962 --> 01:56:52,725
So why are you doing it?
Is there nobody else?

1297
01:56:55,901 --> 01:56:58,529
Because I am the best
sweeper of my street.

1298
01:56:59,571 --> 01:57:01,038
So, I will help you.

1299
01:57:02,607 --> 01:57:03,665
No!

1300
01:57:03,942 --> 01:57:10,677
Hey Phukne... you do the rest
of the cleaning. Come, let's go.

1301
01:57:18,090 --> 01:57:22,151
Shanti, See this lady police has come.

1302
01:57:24,563 --> 01:57:29,626
Panna, it's your name right?
Maltibai's daughter.

1303
01:57:29,701 --> 01:57:31,498
Yes, she is my younger sister.
But since she has joined the...

1304
01:57:31,570 --> 01:57:33,504
...Medical college she
has become big...

1305
01:57:33,572 --> 01:57:35,870
...and she keeps scolding me.

1306
01:57:36,675 --> 01:57:37,801
She is so fair.

1307
01:57:38,877 --> 01:57:41,846
Yes, when I was born I
was a bit more burned...

1308
01:57:42,547 --> 01:57:43,605
...that's why I am dark.

1309
01:57:44,683 --> 01:57:46,514
So was I born raw?

1310
01:57:49,588 --> 01:57:50,782
Bhau, remove the vest and give me.

1311
01:57:50,856 --> 01:57:52,050
I am going to the river to wash it.

1312
01:57:52,124 --> 01:57:55,116
Let that be. Such a lovely
girl has come to our place.

1313
01:57:55,560 --> 01:57:57,528
Who will make refreshments for her?

1314
01:57:59,064 --> 01:58:00,998
Bhau, why don't you make
the pancakes today?

1315
01:58:01,566 --> 01:58:02,624
Look at her!

1316
01:58:02,934 --> 01:58:05,528
He is like that only.
He sings in the lanes...

1317
01:58:05,604 --> 01:58:07,595
...and thinks he does a lot of work.

1318
01:58:07,672 --> 01:58:10,197
And yes, he makes really
good onion pancakes.

1319
01:58:10,275 --> 01:58:12,539
Go now, enough of buttering.
Take her also...

1320
01:58:12,611 --> 01:58:14,704
...and teach her to wash
the clothes too.

1321
01:58:15,814 --> 01:58:16,872
Will you come?

1322
01:58:18,216 --> 01:58:19,274
Do you want to go?

1323
01:58:19,985 --> 01:58:21,543
Come, we will take a stroll.

1324
01:58:21,786 --> 01:58:22,844
Ok, lets go.

1325
01:58:23,688 --> 01:58:24,677
Come.

1326
01:58:26,091 --> 01:58:28,958
Go. By the time I will prepare
breakfast for you.

1327
01:59:00,926 --> 01:59:04,657
Has appeared! From behind
the margosa trees.

1328
01:59:06,531 --> 01:59:10,729
Has appeared! With the
influence of Rahu.

1329
01:59:17,576 --> 01:59:21,876
Has appeared! From behind
the margosa trees.

1330
01:59:23,048 --> 01:59:27,678
Has appeared! With the
influence of Rahu.

1331
01:59:27,752 --> 01:59:31,483
From the brass plate. From
behind the papal branch.

1332
01:59:31,556 --> 01:59:35,492
That round shaped moon has
appeared. Has appeared.

1333
01:59:35,994 --> 01:59:40,158
Has appeared! From behind
the margosa trees.

1334
01:59:41,666 --> 01:59:43,896
Has appeared! With the
influence of Rahu.

1335
01:59:45,837 --> 01:59:47,498
From the brass plate.

1336
01:59:47,572 --> 01:59:49,506
From behind the papal branch.

1337
01:59:49,574 --> 01:59:52,509
'The round shaped
moon has appeared.

1338
01:59:52,844 --> 01:59:57,008
We saw! We saw the
round shaped moon.

1339
02:00:24,809 --> 02:00:27,710
He was hidden behind the clouds.

1340
02:00:27,779 --> 02:00:30,646
In the wet dew drops.

1341
02:00:30,715 --> 02:00:36,153
Hey, the beautiful moon!
Hey the beautiful moon!

1342
02:00:36,221 --> 02:00:38,985
You were bathing in the
water of the lake.

1343
02:00:39,057 --> 02:00:41,651
Was looking very wet and nice.

1344
02:00:41,726 --> 02:00:46,993
I will take the wet moon
and fix him in my ring.

1345
02:00:47,499 --> 02:00:48,830
It slipped from the hands.

1346
02:00:50,068 --> 02:00:52,969
We kept on searching.
- Oh my God!

1347
02:00:53,038 --> 02:00:59,705
It was shining on the hamlet.
Had patches of oil on it.

1348
02:00:59,978 --> 02:01:01,843
Has come out from the oil factory.

1349
02:01:02,681 --> 02:01:05,115
Has come out from the factory.

1350
02:01:05,550 --> 02:01:09,509
Has appeared! The
moon has appeared.

1351
02:01:34,713 --> 02:01:37,477
He is happy to be in
the sky at night...

1352
02:01:37,549 --> 02:01:39,983
...but is scared of the dawn.

1353
02:01:40,518 --> 02:01:45,888
Oh the beautiful moon!
Oh the beautiful moon!

1354
02:01:45,957 --> 02:01:51,156
He is not a thief, but
is scared of the dawn.

1355
02:01:51,563 --> 02:01:58,901
He comes out at night,
but is scared of light.

1356
02:01:59,838 --> 02:02:05,174
Panna, you are mad! Just
smile and show me.

1357
02:02:05,243 --> 02:02:08,508
He comes in the night
to capture our hearts.

1358
02:02:08,580 --> 02:02:11,845
The moon is very naughty.

1359
02:02:12,584 --> 02:02:17,578
Has appeared! From behind
the margosa trees.

1360
02:02:18,022 --> 02:02:20,047
Has appeared! With the
influence of Rahu.

1361
02:02:22,127 --> 02:02:24,527
From the brass plate. From
behind the papal branch.

1362
02:02:24,596 --> 02:02:27,861
That round shaped moon has
appeared. Has appeared.

1363
02:02:54,592 --> 02:02:55,650
Has appeared!

1364
02:02:59,631 --> 02:03:02,623
Catch him. Come on gear up!

1365
02:03:02,700 --> 02:03:07,637
Hey catch him.

1366
02:03:08,640 --> 02:03:10,665
Hey, this is cheating.
- He hit from the leg.

1367
02:03:11,976 --> 02:03:13,034
Come on, wrestler.

1368
02:03:14,145 --> 02:03:17,581
Surround him.

1369
02:03:18,149 --> 02:03:20,743
Hit him on his head.

1370
02:03:22,120 --> 02:03:24,588
Hey! Ganapati! Hail lord Ganapati!

1371
02:03:33,031 --> 02:03:34,931
What are you swaying your hips for?

1372
02:03:38,236 --> 02:03:40,727
Hey you lad! Take
these refreshments.

1373
02:03:45,677 --> 02:03:46,735
Come and sit down.

1374
02:03:56,621 --> 02:03:58,885
Nothing is going to
happen by shouting.

1375
02:03:58,957 --> 02:04:00,549
We have the same future. Go!

1376
02:04:01,559 --> 02:04:02,617
Meaning?

1377
02:04:02,927 --> 02:04:04,554
Both of us are going to
be beheaded one day.

1378
02:04:06,865 --> 02:04:07,991
Are you not afraid?

1379
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:10,625
By whom? A non
- vegetarian?

1380
02:04:11,603 --> 02:04:12,831
No.
- Then?

1381
02:04:15,607 --> 02:04:16,665
By the politicians?

1382
02:04:16,741 --> 02:04:20,233
Why to fear them? They themselves
are so insecure.

1383
02:04:20,578 --> 02:04:24,742
They do this same thing. Look
what is this? Do you know?

1384
02:04:26,017 --> 02:04:28,815
Yes, kabaddi! - Yes!

1385
02:04:29,187 --> 02:04:34,523
We call it Hu Tu Tu. The
politicians do the same.

1386
02:04:35,527 --> 02:04:37,518
Lift and throw, pulling
and scratching.

1387
02:04:37,929 --> 02:04:41,865
Pull his leg, twist his arms, make
him sit and make him stand.

1388
02:04:45,003 --> 02:04:47,870
This should be our national
game. What do you think?

1389
02:04:48,806 --> 02:04:50,205
That is true!
- Is it?

1390
02:04:50,275 --> 02:04:53,073
Yes! - Then we have chosen
the right game.

1391
02:04:55,847 --> 02:04:59,544
And like the villagers, the
whole nation is sitting...

1392
02:04:59,617 --> 02:05:03,747
...and watching their game quietly.

1393
02:05:09,160 --> 02:05:13,563
For the last fifty years
our nation has produced...

1394
02:05:13,631 --> 02:05:19,763
...only ministers, but
not a single leader.

1395
02:05:21,839 --> 02:05:22,897
How are they born?

1396
02:05:23,641 --> 02:05:28,772
With faith, belief. You must
believe in what you do.

1397
02:05:29,614 --> 02:05:32,014
Like, Joshi sir?

1398
02:05:33,918 --> 02:05:39,515
Yes! Now I remember where
had I seen you before?

1399
02:05:39,591 --> 02:05:42,685
In Joshi master's house; your
friend was also with you.

1400
02:05:43,928 --> 02:05:48,524
Where's he now? What's his name?

1401
02:05:51,069 --> 02:05:52,127
Adi.

1402
02:05:52,570 --> 02:05:54,128
What?
- Adi.

1403
02:05:55,873 --> 02:05:56,931
Aditya.

1404
02:05:57,008 --> 02:05:58,066
He is a nice boy;

1405
02:06:04,148 --> 02:06:08,551
hey, you miss him?

1406
02:06:10,221 --> 02:06:14,954
Bhau! Come soon. Fast.

1407
02:06:16,227 --> 02:06:17,285
I am coming.

1408
02:06:20,098 --> 02:06:28,665
Take such a long smoke that you
will almost instantly die.

1409
02:06:41,019 --> 02:06:42,077
Is Bhau there?

1410
02:06:44,188 --> 02:06:45,553
No.
- Is this his house?

1411
02:06:46,891 --> 02:06:51,692
Yes. - Did Panna come here?
Malti madam's daughter?

1412
02:06:52,964 --> 02:06:57,526
Who is it? What is it?

1413
02:06:58,069 --> 02:07:00,594
Your mother has called you home.
She wants you back.

1414
02:07:00,672 --> 02:07:02,572
So. What was the need
to send the police?

1415
02:07:02,874 --> 02:07:03,932
She's said that if she doesn't
come on her own...

1416
02:07:04,008 --> 02:07:05,066
...then bring her forcibly.

1417
02:07:06,044 --> 02:07:08,638
How can you take me just like
that? You can't force me.

1418
02:07:09,580 --> 02:07:12,708
I have come here on my own.
Nobody has brought me here.

1419
02:07:13,584 --> 02:07:14,642
Go and tell this at home.

1420
02:07:14,719 --> 02:07:18,655
Hey you! Do not touch her. Get away.

1421
02:07:19,557 --> 02:07:25,496
Panna! Go now.

1422
02:07:26,664 --> 02:07:28,029
There is no
need to increase the fight.

1423
02:07:31,569 --> 02:07:32,627
Where is Bhau?

1424
02:07:32,704 --> 02:07:34,501
Yesterday night he had
gone to the hospital...

1425
02:07:34,572 --> 02:07:36,938
...to see some patient, he
has not yet returned.

1426
02:08:13,044 --> 02:08:14,102
Panna?

1427
02:08:23,788 --> 02:08:26,552
What happened?

1428
02:08:26,624 --> 02:08:32,722
Mother has called me. Humiliating
me like this.

1429
02:08:42,173 --> 02:08:47,577
Our Bai is like that only,
very short tempered.

1430
02:08:50,515 --> 02:08:53,507
Your mother has now become a chief
- minister.

1431
02:08:55,953 --> 02:08:58,717
She is going to be honoured
by a big civic reception.

1432
02:09:00,191 --> 02:09:02,785
The preparations are on in Panvel.

1433
02:09:08,566 --> 02:09:09,931
Why don't you say something?

1434
02:09:13,171 --> 02:09:15,935
Nothing has happened to me. Nothing.

1435
02:09:16,607 --> 02:09:24,241
Nothing serious, just a routine
check- up. Don't worry.

1436
02:09:26,150 --> 02:09:27,208
Don't worry.

1437
02:09:45,570 --> 02:09:46,628
Give me some coffee.

1438
02:09:50,708 --> 02:09:52,801
Mom.
- Yes.

1439
02:09:54,879 --> 02:09:56,005
I am taking father with me.

1440
02:09:58,583 --> 02:09:59,641
Where?

1441
02:10:00,251 --> 02:10:03,880
Village. Sewree! In the
same jaggery house.

1442
02:10:05,756 --> 02:10:06,814
What is left there?

1443
02:10:10,962 --> 02:10:17,868
There are walls, in them some
grass and their roots.

1444
02:10:20,171 --> 02:10:24,130
Even though dry, I will water them.

1445
02:10:27,645 --> 02:10:29,476
Since when did Bhau
start influencing you?

1446
02:10:31,148 --> 02:10:32,945
From the time Bhau has
started residing in me.

1447
02:10:34,986 --> 02:10:36,647
That bastard has got... - Mother...

1448
02:10:42,526 --> 02:10:45,859
Even you... are talking like me.

1449
02:11:22,867 --> 02:11:24,801
Our well is still clean, dad!

1450
02:11:24,869 --> 02:11:27,463
Yes! Doesn't it feel good?

1451
02:11:27,838 --> 02:11:28,896
Yes! Very good.

1452
02:11:30,608 --> 02:11:34,635
Be careful. You never
went to your home.

1453
02:11:36,647 --> 02:11:38,080
But I have come back to mine.

1454
02:11:39,116 --> 02:11:42,483
I brought you here, to
your maternal home.

1455
02:11:47,658 --> 02:11:51,685
Good you brought me here otherwise...

1456
02:11:53,164 --> 02:11:55,962
...I did not have the strength
to break away from there.

1457
02:12:02,106 --> 02:12:09,035
Dad. Do you think we have
drifted away from mom?

1458
02:12:12,883 --> 02:12:19,516
Yes, I had drifted quite a long
time back. I was just like a hanging...

1459
02:12:19,590 --> 02:12:26,587
...limb with her like a
polio infested hand.

1460
02:12:27,999 --> 02:12:29,057
And me dad?

1461
02:12:30,201 --> 02:12:34,535
You... you never was with her. Don't
know why but you never trusted...

1462
02:12:34,605 --> 02:12:39,201
...your mother right
from the childhood.

1463
02:12:41,779 --> 02:12:43,679
Dad, you were a mute spectator?

1464
02:12:45,549 --> 02:12:54,048
Justice, injustice you never
said anything. Why?

1465
02:12:54,558 --> 02:12:55,616
I...

1466
02:13:03,834 --> 02:13:04,892
- What were you saying, dad?

1467
02:13:06,704 --> 02:13:13,576
I am very ashamed. I never has
the guts to say or believe...

1468
02:13:13,644 --> 02:13:20,982
...that Gadre broke my home.

1469
02:13:24,688 --> 02:13:26,519
One day he had taunted me.

1470
02:13:27,224 --> 02:13:30,193
But still I couldn't
say that I knew.

1471
02:13:31,896 --> 02:13:38,995
What? What dad?

1472
02:13:40,237 --> 02:13:45,971
I know that Arun is not my son.

1473
02:13:48,712 --> 02:13:50,043
But I still brought him up.

1474
02:13:54,552 --> 02:13:55,610
Dad?

1475
02:14:13,237 --> 02:14:15,034
Madhu, is the picture clear?

1476
02:14:15,940 --> 02:14:16,998
No, wait!

1477
02:14:24,014 --> 02:14:25,003
It went out again?

1478
02:14:25,082 --> 02:14:30,987
Yes. Oh, it has come. Now you watch.

1479
02:14:43,868 --> 02:14:47,565
Shanti? Oh God; there is a
fire in Bhau's locality.

1480
02:14:47,638 --> 02:14:48,696
What?

1481
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:53,936
Dad, there is a fire
in Bhau's locality.

1482
02:14:54,678 --> 02:15:01,550
Fire in his locality?
When did it happen?

1483
02:15:03,754 --> 02:15:06,723
Yesterday or maybe day before,
they are telecasting it now.

1484
02:15:07,024 --> 02:15:09,549
I don't know, when?
- Ok!

1485
02:15:15,633 --> 02:15:16,930
Do you want to go there?

1486
02:15:17,001 --> 02:15:22,064
Can I? Just go and see.

1487
02:15:22,139 --> 02:15:29,511
Ok, but take Madhu with you. Do
not go alone. And take care.

1488
02:16:20,731 --> 02:16:23,564
Why have you stopped it in the
middle of the road? Go ahead.

1489
02:16:23,634 --> 02:16:24,692
I can't help! It is not going
in front. What can I do?

1490
02:16:24,768 --> 02:16:28,602
Put her in the car, fast.

1491
02:16:28,672 --> 02:16:31,505
Help me!

1492
02:16:33,043 --> 02:16:34,101
And take her away.

1493
02:16:35,045 --> 02:16:36,512
Come on, let's go.

1494
02:17:05,009 --> 02:17:06,067
Oh god.

1495
02:17:11,882 --> 02:17:12,940
Come up!

1496
02:17:31,168 --> 02:17:34,831
Please be seated! Thank you

1497
02:17:40,177 --> 02:17:41,508
I think you are aware...

1498
02:17:41,578 --> 02:17:43,512
...as to why I have called this
emergency meeting tonight?

1499
02:17:43,580 --> 02:17:44,638
Yes madam.

1500
02:17:44,715 --> 02:17:46,182
I have called you all
so late in the night...

1501
02:18:42,506 --> 02:18:46,499
Listen. What is happening outside?

1502
02:18:46,577 --> 02:18:48,841
There is a lot of commotion.

1503
02:18:50,080 --> 02:18:52,014
Maybe your man has come.

1504
02:19:01,859 --> 02:19:02,917
What happened to Mr. Joshi?

1505
02:19:03,193 --> 02:19:04,854
You know him?
- Yes. What happened?

1506
02:19:05,596 --> 02:19:06,995
There is a rumour that he has
committed suicide in prison.

1507
02:19:07,965 --> 02:19:10,866
Is it a joke? The police
think that we are fools.

1508
02:19:12,236 --> 02:19:13,533
They must have killed him
and then hanged him.

1509
02:19:15,205 --> 02:19:16,263
Who put him in jail?

1510
02:19:16,607 --> 02:19:17,665
Who else?

1511
02:19:25,816 --> 02:19:28,148
I am sending the body
to the mortuary.

1512
02:19:29,186 --> 02:19:30,813
The post mortem will only
be done in the morning.

1513
02:19:31,522 --> 02:19:32,580
Ok.

1514
02:19:42,900 --> 02:19:43,958
What is your name?

1515
02:19:47,504 --> 02:19:48,562
Madhurani.

1516
02:19:48,639 --> 02:19:50,971
Come on get up! We are
sending you home.

1517
02:19:51,041 --> 02:19:54,204
No I won't leave her.
I will go with Panna.

1518
02:19:56,980 --> 02:19:58,038
Where are you sending her?

1519
02:19:58,115 --> 02:20:01,551
Home. We have to pass
a message to madam,

1520
02:20:01,952 --> 02:20:03,010
Who madam?

1521
02:20:03,086 --> 02:20:06,180
Don't you know? Pick her up!

1522
02:20:06,857 --> 02:20:08,017
No. I don't want to.

1523
02:20:08,091 --> 02:20:11,026
Please, don't take her.

1524
02:20:11,094 --> 02:20:12,584
Get up. Or else who
will take our message?

1525
02:20:12,663 --> 02:20:14,528
They should get our message.

1526
02:20:19,536 --> 02:20:23,939
Panna, save me. Panna!
- Come on! - Panna!

1527
02:21:28,138 --> 02:21:29,196
Bhau?

1528
02:21:37,881 --> 02:21:38,939
Bhau?

1529
02:22:21,758 --> 02:22:22,884
Bhau?

1530
02:22:30,801 --> 02:22:33,133
So tell me! How should I send you?

1531
02:22:37,174 --> 02:22:41,736
Like this! Almost half dead?
Or completely dead?

1532
02:22:41,812 --> 02:22:44,610
Bhau? Bhau?

1533
02:22:53,557 --> 02:22:57,118
Bhau? - There's no use trying?
Now nothing can be done of him.

1534
02:22:59,563 --> 02:23:01,554
By giving him electric
shocks, they have...

1535
02:23:01,632 --> 02:23:03,156
...made him a vegetable...

1536
02:23:07,904 --> 02:23:11,237
We are like Cow dung, all of us.

1537
02:23:12,843 --> 02:23:16,574
We all are suppressed under
the burden of History.

1538
02:23:16,647 --> 02:23:20,583
If only once anyone tries to
burn this pile of history.

1539
02:23:20,651 --> 02:23:24,587
If once anyone tries to burn
this pile of history...

1540
02:23:36,199 --> 02:23:41,865
Send me; send me also like this!

1541
02:23:42,606 --> 02:23:49,535
I know who is behind all this!
My mom is responsible for this.

1542
02:23:49,613 --> 02:23:52,548
Not your Mom, don't give her
such a respectful status.

1543
02:23:54,818 --> 02:23:57,013
Do you think that I do not know
who finished Mr. Joshi?

1544
02:23:59,222 --> 02:24:03,249
This is politics, politics my dear.
The power of politics!

1545
02:24:05,629 --> 02:24:08,564
And to finish this malice
from the society...

1546
02:24:08,632 --> 02:24:11,726
...God won't come down to help us.

1547
02:24:13,270 --> 02:24:14,635
We will only have to do this
job by shedding our blood.

1548
02:24:18,709 --> 02:24:20,006
Make sure that bhau
reaches the village.

1549
02:24:22,846 --> 02:24:24,575
I will make sure that
she reaches the rally.

1550
02:24:29,052 --> 02:24:33,113
Not like this! I won't go like this!

1551
02:24:36,159 --> 02:24:40,528
Now you will take me
there as per my wish.

1552
02:25:05,622 --> 02:25:06,680
Come,

1553
02:25:17,701 --> 02:25:18,759
Panna.

1554
02:25:38,088 --> 02:25:39,146
You are looking really beautiful.

1555
02:25:58,809 --> 02:26:00,800
Tell me the latest position.

1556
02:26:00,877 --> 02:26:02,640
Greetings. - Over!

1557
02:26:07,784 --> 02:26:09,547
Have you arranged for everything?
- Yes.

1558
02:26:09,619 --> 02:26:10,950
Check it once more.

1559
02:26:11,221 --> 02:26:12,279
Okay sir.

1560
02:26:19,629 --> 02:26:22,223
Ok. Where are you going?
Go at the back.

1561
02:26:22,299 --> 02:26:24,631
Come on, go there.
I am telling you to go there.

1562
02:26:31,641 --> 02:26:35,702
Come on, run. Run.

1563
02:26:38,548 --> 02:26:40,641
Hurry up. Make it fast.

1564
02:26:40,717 --> 02:26:43,049
Come on.

1565
02:26:52,829 --> 02:26:55,093
Ok, wait here; be somewhere
near only, okay?

1566
02:27:39,075 --> 02:27:42,511
Move brother! Let us go!
Move! Let us go!

1567
02:27:42,579 --> 02:27:45,013
Hey careful. Keep moving.

1568
02:27:56,626 --> 02:28:00,027
I am very thirsty.

1569
02:28:01,031 --> 02:28:02,862
There is a lot of security
on this gate,

1570
02:28:05,602 --> 02:28:06,660
They have even got sniffer dogs here.

1571
02:28:07,137 --> 02:28:10,868
Come let's go near the other gate.

1572
02:28:37,634 --> 02:28:38,692
What happened sir?

1573
02:28:39,002 --> 02:28:41,027
I think she is Malti Devi's daughter.

1574
02:28:41,938 --> 02:28:43,496
No, sir they all look the same.

1575
02:28:43,573 --> 02:28:45,507
No, I have seen her;
she is definitely...

1576
02:28:45,575 --> 02:28:49,204
...Malti Devi's daughter!
Now where did she go?

1577
02:28:50,580 --> 02:28:51,911
We can see the convoy now.

1578
02:28:54,751 --> 02:28:56,651
Hello, everyone please be ready.

1579
02:28:56,720 --> 02:28:58,017
The convoy is on it's way

1580
02:28:58,088 --> 02:29:00,522
The convoy is reaching here;
I think we should announce it.

1581
02:29:28,184 --> 02:29:32,746
Brothers and sisters, Madam
will be arriving any moment.

1582
02:29:33,656 --> 02:29:34,987
I request all of you to stand up...

1583
02:29:35,058 --> 02:29:36,582
...and give her a standing ovation.

1584
02:29:36,659 --> 02:29:40,186
Madam Malti will be arriving
any moment.

1585
02:29:41,564 --> 02:29:46,592
I request all of you to stand up
and give her a standing ovation.

1586
02:29:47,837 --> 02:29:48,895
Malti Devi has come.

1587
02:29:49,873 --> 02:29:52,000

02:31:29,973 --> 02:31:32,965
Hey, why are you pushing
us like that?

1622
02:31:40,850 --> 02:31:42,147
Why do have to come
to such a large rally...

1623
02:31:42,218 --> 02:31:43,981
...if you are handicapped with
your leg? Go get lost.

1624
02:31:57,167 --> 02:31:58,998

Long live Malti Devi!

1638
02:32:48,718 --> 02:32:49,776
Mom.

1639
02:32:58,194 --> 02:32:59,252
Panna.

1640
02:33:15,979 --> 02:33:17,037
How are you?

1641
02:33:19,115 --> 02:33:20,173
I am fine.

1642
02:33:25,788 --> 02:33:26,846
You are you not feeling well?

1643
02:33:31,194 --> 02:33:34,527
You were coughing while
on the way; I saw it.

1644
02:33:36,866 --> 02:33:39,528
Hey, you don't come here get inside.

1645
02:33:43,206 --> 02:33:44,264
Adi.

1646
02:34:24,180 --> 02:34:25,169

1649
02:35:15,231 --> 02:35:17,563
Maltibai is blown up.

1650
02:35:33,583 --> 02:35:43,185
Whenever sun rises, every
time there is an eclipse.

1651
02:35:43,860 --> 02:35:47,523
When the sky is full of vapours...

1652
02:35:47,597 --> 02:35:51,192
the clouds steal it away.

1653
02:35:52,001 --> 02:35:56,529
This prestige of mine.

1654
02:35:57,039 --> 02:36:01,533
Return my self respect back to me.

1655
02:36:02,044 --> 02:36:03,102
Long live the nation.

1656
02:36:03,179 --> 02:36:04,544
Long live the nation.

1657
02:36:04,614 --> 02:36:06,548

Long live the nation."

1662

Long live the nation.

1663
02:36:17,727 --> 02:36:18,989
The holy book is mine.

1664
02:36:19,061 --> 02:36:20,153
The History is mine.

1665
02:36:20,229 --> 02:36:22,789
My discipline, my belief.

1666
02:36:22,865 --> 02:36:24,833
My land of work.
- My land of birth.

1667
02:36:24,901 --> 02:36:26,163
This is my nation.
