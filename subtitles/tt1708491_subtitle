1
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,959
We have to do it.

2
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,359
Everything will be over todaywhether we do it or not.

3
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,159
Our village people will become against of us.

4
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,719
We will lose our MalarvadiArts club once for all.

5
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,119
We'd have known about Ragav's deceit already.

6
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,839
There's no use in telling that now.

7
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,359
Have you never heard that "however we trywe can't get back the lost thing"?

8
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,879
We've got into this matter together.

9
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,079
But we didn't think about the consequence, did we?

10
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,519
Prakash! Whatever it is.

11
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,999
Whether we attack them or get attacked by them, we're united. Right?

12
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:27,359
MALARVADI ARTS CLUB]

13
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,439
I got a desire, which is greaterthan the gold also.

14
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,879
I got that desire once upon a time. -Kuttu!

15
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,919
You got that desire once upon a time. Right? Leave it.

16

You be happy now.

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,759
Why are you advising menegatively, man?

18
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,959
As I didn't have money to buy a cooling glassto show my style in front of her...

19
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,559
I sold Pazhasi Raja ticket in black & bought cooling glass in that money.

20
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,199
When I jumped across women hostel wall to see, a doghas bitten me. Have you forgotten these?

21
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,399
Leave it, man. Women islike a sea.

22
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,559
It's a sea, where thousands of people get immersed and die off.

23
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,519
No. I won't allow itto immerse me.

24
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,439
An artist is getting createdby his suffer only.

25
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,439
An artist has got created in me also.

26
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,319
Kuttu! Ask that artist to go & come tomorrow. I can't say so.

27
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,079
That artist wantsto sing now.

28
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,719
Or he will feel a lot.

29
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,559
Don't feel a lot Sing.

30
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,999
I need a beat. A background music.

00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:45,199
Ascetic! I've come as a eveningflower in your almshouse.

00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:22,959
I was protecting it like a flower. He's come & taken it fully from the route.

34
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:38,719
Oh God! Why is this fate for me alone?

35
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:55,239
I was protecting it like a flower. He's come & taken it fully from the route.

36
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,279
Tell him that we can go now.

To murder you Kumara brother.

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,799
Does your party believe such enemy destruction Pooja?

79
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,399
You man! We'd not involve our party in this matter.

80
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,639
It's enough if our Malarvadi boys come here. Ragavan will run off.

81
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,879
Those guys will prepare soup boiling his head.

82
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,959

He's changed that as an arts club,when those grew up.

91
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,039
Is there any use because of that?

92
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,039
It's a year since they have come out of their college.

93
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,879
Are they going for any job at least?

94

Period of revolution hasgone, Shankara

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,399
There are only crimes now.

100
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,639
Revolution is there in old people's heart only like us.

101
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,839
Good beatings. They didn't leaveany part of his body.

102
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,919
Can anybody beat a person like this inonly 2 minutes time? Very good

You man! I know that youwill feel a lot for me.

105
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,839
Did they leave any part in my body without damaging?

106
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,359
It's there. -What are those parts? -Your nails & hairs.

107
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,039
What can you get by killing that Kumar brother, boss?

108
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,159
If Kumaran dies without having any family,who will get his properties? Who?

109
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,519
I only will get it, who ishis only relative.

110
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,959
TI

111
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,319
Do you know what is the value of his building & land now?

112
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,039
What is its value, boss?-It's what we say

113
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,199
What is its value, boss?-It's what we say.

114
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:17,679
But in this condition, when I think about the goodness as they didn't come yet...

115
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,679
As they didn't come...?What's that, man?

ಆDು.

If they throw stone of our friend, should not we revenge for it?

120
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,919
I rang up to area committee immediately

121
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,799
I understood that matter's value onlywhen I called to secretary.

122
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,279
Odeinthusan.com He's announced the bandh.

Dasa! If our party announce the bandh who can open the shop?

129
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,759
Nobody will come outtomorrow.

130
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,919
You take care ofthose matters.

131
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,679
Our force will be readyhere. Right?

132
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,679
What's this, boys? I called everybody for the meeting at 10 o'clock. Right?

133
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,959
It's 10:30 now. Right? Where are the others?

134
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,359
663What can we do, Sudhakar brother?

135
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,199

137
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,199
You keep quiet, man.

138
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,239
Nobody has a fear on our party-now a days. Right?

139
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,079
Why should they fear for party, brother? They'd love it right?

140
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,279
I asked you only to keep quiet.

141
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,399
Not coming to our party meeting in time is called carelessness.

142
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,239
I told this to them Sudhakar brother.

143
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,079
K.P.Sathish told that it is not a carelessness.

144
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,039
DOHe tells this as a responsibility.

145
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,439
I didn't know how to answer for it.

146
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:55,759
Not like before. We are travelingacross a great-tragedy now.

147
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,399
Where did Malarvadi boys go?

148
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,639
They are not there in the nearer police station also.

149
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,879
I called to many places.

150
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,119
We can approach those Tamil Naduguys to stick notice hereafter.

151
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,039
It's enough if we get them liquor & beef.

152
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,519
I think we'd import people also from Tamil Nadulike how we import rice from there.

153
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,479
It's difficult

154
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,039
Sudhakar brother! I think everythingbecome alright.

155
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,079
Gathering people is not so tough. Do you know?Ragavan is going to open the shop.

156
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,199
Our party people had beatenhim last night. Right?

157
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,439
To revenge for that... With the support of having that case...

158
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,599
Saraswathi vilas school headmaster is also going to open his school adamantly.

159
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,479
Nobody can do anything.

160
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,639
I heard that our boys are there in Muzhapilagadu police station.

161
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,719
I've arranged to releasethem also.

162
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,959
Let them come here.

163
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,719
Let them come here.

My Prakash! You peoplehave come. Right?

167
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,999

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,719
Ragavan's shop. SaraswathiVilasam school.

169
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,279
Go.

170
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,399
Prakash!

171
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:22,239
What? -A small problem took place,when you guys were not here.

172
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,999
You'd not do anythingin hasty.

173
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:30,719
Ragavan tried to destroy Kumaran brother last night.

174
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,279
Buddy! Nobody is therein the road.

175
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,279
We can start after 10 minutes.You call Shami & Shadiq

176
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,759
Sekara! One... I've urinatedYou go & urinate.

177
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,919
Not that. Come there for a minute.I have to tell you a matter.

178
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:14,479
I've come with key closingmy shop as you said that you come with 5 goondas.

179
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,919
I got afraid, when I saw you with them from the distance in Kaikotu bus stop.

180
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,439
With the only belief as Malarvadiboys are not in station...

181
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,439
SeThat's why I've brought you here.

182
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,159
You don't lose that confidence.

183
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:34,079
Prema! You don't fear so. The one, who stands there is a 7th black belt holder.

184
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:39,119
He killed 50 people in Andalur temple festival.

185
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,799
Is that he told you about my pride particularly, didn't I?

186
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,319
You go & open theshop bravely.

187
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,839
Your body will not get any scratch.

188
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,119
Sekaran is telling this.

189
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,639
Andalur murders. 7th black belt holder is here. With that belief...

190
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,519
Prakash! No. Don't burn it.

191
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,519
We won't bear even if anybody plansto destroy Kumaran brother.

192
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,439
He is like a father figure to us.

193
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,919
Sekara! Beat him Beat him man.

194
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,519
You will get controlled only if you get Sekar's hit. Right?

195
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,039
Beat him

196
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,839
Where am I?

197
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,959
Run off. Run off, man

198
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,599
Are you a mad Pig?

199
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,439
Run off. Prema! Go slowly. I don't know the routes here. -Go, useless fellow.

200
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,119
Boss! Boss!

201
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,599
Oh God. Has he passed away?

202
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,479
It's a liquor.

203
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,879
Boss!

204
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,679
My scooter.

205
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,839
My scooter.

206
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,959
Boss! Cool down We cancorrect everything

207
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,999
What can you correct?

208
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,159
I won't leave them. A London return friend gave that as a compliment to my grandpa

209
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,319
This man's grandpa was a spy of Britisher. Right?

210
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,439
His generation is not good totally

211
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,159
You tell me something without standing with suffer like this.

212
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,479
What should I do further?

213
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,279
Boss! There's no usein getting angry.

214
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,159
Even if our plan got failed, justice isthere in our side this time.

215
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,439
It's enough if we get anybodyto give witness for it.

216
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,439
We can finish those guys.

217
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,439
Let me check it over.

218
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,559
Prakash! Your rowdismhas got increased.

219
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,159
Keep quiet, man. He's burnt Ragavan'sscooter. Right? He deserves this.

220
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,599
Then what? Sushil isvery happy now.

221
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,799
THe was so happy seeinghis activity.

222
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,399
If we creates any danger, our partywill suffer to get succeeded.

223
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,439
This is a country, which thinksabout the dangers.

224
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,999
People, who involve in rowdism.will face the loss.

225
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,359
That alone...!

226
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,759
Hey! Come.

227
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,039
I knew the matters.

228
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,359
Burning a vehicle to punish our opponent is always good.

229
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,999
How can it be if others fear on party boys gets reduced?

230
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,679
That will get changed by this. I've told people, who were watching that incident

231
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,919
I threatened them that I'd break their teeth if they give witness against us.

232
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,879
You've gone there by your jeep to lock the school. Right? Keep this.

233
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,919
Go!

234
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,319
It's become a great tragedy. Burninga scooter to lock that school.

235
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,039
What a tiredness?

236
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,559
I want to take some rest. Shall we goto Mahe & take drinks? -What?

237
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,079
No. Let's drink a little. Right? Shouldn't we take drinks in Mahe?

238
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,439
What's your opinion, Prakash?

239
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,839
Good. Let's call Santhosh also. -We can't call Santhosh, buddy.

240
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,879
His father will be there in home.

241
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,519
That man is very serious as their case is in process.

242
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,519
How can you say like this?

243
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,519
Whatever it is. He'syoung isn't he?

244
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,599
Is there no freedom for a youngsterto take drinks also in this city?

245
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,319
Let's go there. If he doesn't cometo take drinks, I'll beat you.

246
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,399
Is it so? How it will be if Santhosh doesn't come?

247
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,839
Let they give judgmentin my case.

248
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,319
Let they give judgmentin my case.

249
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,039
It's enough if I get money selling that Keramadai land.

It's become useless. Why don't you guys vacate this place?

319
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:18,759
It's a box in which I kept ancient pink drama costumes.

320
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,599
It's a brandy bottle, which we took on that day,

321
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,439
...When Praveen got first place in arts competition.

322

00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,399
Toget placed in any company.

338
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,199
Then he will get a job responsibility and family...!

339
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,279
Can such guys think like us?

340
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,119
To get united like this... ?

341
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,439
To get united like this...?

You got good beatings in police stationHe burnt a scooter immediately

343
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,119
You people got money froma great party leader.

344
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:58,279
Not only this. You are talking badly about those guys, who lead a prestigious life.

345
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,639
This is called life. Right?

346
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,999
Your opinions are not right.

347
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,599
That's okay. Have you guys started?

348
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,559
Your share is here. There'sno any time for that.

349
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,639
A matter is there. -What happened?

350
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,639
We've got an order

351
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,439
It's a youngsters camp, which takes place in Nerungulam tomorrow.

352
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,479
Some other party took the light& sound orderit seems.

353
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,199
Something went wrong. But We got that order finally.

354
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,319
Ifwe do it, my dad asked me to get a share in this money.

355
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,319
Hey! It's a good way forour Goa-trip, isn't it?

356
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,959
Yes. Finishit soon. We have more works now.

357
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:46,119
Oh God. What's this? Should we build the canopy here?

358
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,999
Hey! When your heart feels bad. it's enough'if you think about Goa

359
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,679
'I'm planning to get involvedin politics full time.

360
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,079
I don't want to takesuch an order.

361
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,799
Van is there. Light sound and canopy.

362
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,999
They will get more money for light & sound.Right?-Shall we ask Rs.5000 totally?

363
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,559
There's no any problem in Rs.5000.We ask you Rs.5000.

364
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:36,319
Are you asking us? Brother! We didn'tkeep these items in auction.

365
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,319
Rs. 5000. -We are not in a position to give you.

366
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,399
If you had helped us, when we were unloadingthese, we'd have given you something.

367
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:54,119
We can't give you stipend for just watching us without doing any work.

368
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,079
You should be careful without opposing us.

369
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,239
With us also... -Hey!You keep quiet.

370
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,839
Brothers! Please don't create any confusion.

371
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,159
We got this order for a very small amount.

372
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,839
High command didn't tell us that you'd ask money from us like this.

373
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,999
High command can take many decisions.

374
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,519
But we have our own high command in this Nerungulam.

375
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,719
Yes. If he gives any signal, cock won't crow & dog won't bark here.

376
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,959
Cow won't produce cow dung also. Yes.

377
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,319
Cow won't produce cow dung also. Yes.

378
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,879
In that case go and bring syour high command, man

379
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,639
What, man? I heard that youare a problematic man.

380
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,559
Is it so? Can you createany confusion here?

381
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,559
Tell me, man. Are yougetting angry?

382
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,719
Tell me, man. Do you wantto beat me?

383
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:21,199
Beat me, man. Try to beatme once, man.

384
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,839
You've beaten this great Kattapuram Sashi, haven't you?

385
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,919
I'll show you my influence, man

386
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,319
I'll show you my influence, man

387
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,439
Is that party office?

388
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,359
Give the phone to Shaji brother. Shaji brother! It's me Kattapuram

389
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,519
There's a small problem here.

390
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:04,279
You idiot! I wanted to see you. Have youspoiled our party's fame, Pig?

391
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,999
I won't keep you & yourpeople in my party.

392
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,039
You're not allowing St. Mary's college girls to walk on road. Right?

393
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:16,239
Not like that, brother. -Then? I got love on a girl among them.

394
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,559
That's all. -Are you saying boldly about your love? She's my uncle's daughter.

395
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:25,239
If you disturb her, I'll finish your chapter. Understand... ? Disconnect the call. -Okay.

396
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,919
Shaji brother asked me to leave you guys as you are innocent.

397
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,599
Let's don't disturb the party quarrellingin between us hereafter.

398
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,999
So tell them that we will do them small favours.

399
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,919
Let them pay us accordingto their wish.Lot them pay us according


400
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,879
If we don't need your help...?

401
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,319
Come with me. Come. UMNO

402
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,239
He's playing with Sashi brother. I think 'he is going to finish that guy's chapter.

403
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,999
Please don't leave me.

404
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,199
I doubt that my teeth will get broken or not if you beat me.

405
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:19,359
We don't know anything else exceptshouting & promising others.

406
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,519
Please support us now.

407
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,239
It's enough if you payus a little amount.

408
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,919
Okay. You come.

409
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,439
We got afraid unnecessarily. If you harm him in anger...?

410
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,239
They are small boys. Right?Let's help them

411
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,479
Don't spend more money in bar, then

412
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,799
It'll create a problem in maintainingour body. -Then? Come.

413
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,119
My spinal cord hasgot broken

414
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,799
Here. There...! Tie that tightly.

415
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,359
Here. There...! Tie that tightly.

416

Where is he?

421
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,959
Kumaran brother! -Whathappened to him?

422
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,879
Tell me. What happened to him?

423
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,519
Nothing. Why did you involve in your job?

424
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,319
You know that he doesn't know your work. Right?

425
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,439
Kumaran brother! -You don'ttouch me.

426
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,959
You're doing row dism & burning scooters.

427
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,639
Is these all your works now, right?ta

428
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,479
Did you try to murdermy son man?

429
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,399
Didn't I tell you thousands of timesnot to join him with you guys?

430
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,479
If anything happens to him wrongly I won't leave anybody in you guys.

431
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,039
Dhamodhara! Cool down. -You'd not tell even a word.

432
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,799
He is a boy, who wasstudying well.

433
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,439
You only spoiled him in the name of song & music.

434
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,439
He didn't get consciousness. He lost moreblood because of his head injury

435
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,479
We need somebody's blood, whose group is O negative.

436
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,199
My blood group is o negative.-That's good. Come.

437
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,279
What happened? Don't feel alot. Everything will become alright

438
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,479
Patient has got consciousness. Who is Prakash in this group?

439
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,599
He calls you inside

440
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,079
Hey! Only one person is allowed.

441
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,399
Who asked you to do a work,what you don't know?

442
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,919
ligot blamed for everything now.

443
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,599
Your dad gave a performancejust before.

444
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,519
How was it? What's that? -My dad's performance...?

445
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,879
'It was majestic. If I go out from here,he will scold me.

446
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,479
'It was majestic. If I go out from here,he will scold me.

447
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,799
There's no any lack for your anger even after losing your blood, is it, Prakash?

448
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,679
What, Prema? Are you practicingfor-Olympic games?

449
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,039
Olympics games will be helphere by next week

450
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,679
But Malarvadi guys only will be running in that.

451
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,519
Boss!

452
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:42,519
Boss! I didn't have faith on God. But I've realized my guilt now.

453
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,999
After when God took over everything from me...?

454
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,559
I've got it. -Did you getkiss from Sarasu?

455
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,279
I've got it. -Did you geta room also?

456
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,399
You silly! I've got an evidence.-Evidence...? What's that?

457
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,359
Here. See this, boss.

458
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,719
Did you see this?

459
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,319
See this.

460
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,039
Did you see this play? -How you got it?-Did you understand the God now?

461
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,279
Or... How could a man recordedthis incident in his mobile,

462
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,679
...tell that to Sivan & how could Sivan told me this?

463
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,799
I caught that boy on the spot as soon as knowing this truth.

464
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:19,399
Bun. -Sorry. We've got this mobile. Malarvadiguys lives is there in our hands now.

465
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,479
Smart boy! It's enough.

466
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,839
Smart boy! It's enough

467
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,919
MY

468
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,879
I'll play a drama with this

469
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,199
You only told that burning our enemy'svehicle is good, didn't you?

470
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:33,519
You only told that burning our enemy'svehicle is good, didn't you?

471
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,159
You'man! That's good only

472
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,959
Doing a mistake is not a mistake.

473
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,559
But not keeping that mistake as confidential, is a mistake.

474
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,479
But not keeping that mistake as confidential, is a mistake.

475
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,439
Ragavan is coming

476
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,039
Party didn't give you any licenseof doing any row dism

477
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,679
If you burn a person's scooter in the daytime, how great mistake is this?

478
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,879
You people will get a badname to our party.

479
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:03,039
In whatever high post may be the accused is.Taking action against him is party's rule.

480
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,879
Don't you know that?

481
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,439
What happened is happened?

482
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,799
Scooter has got burnt. Let's forgetthat incident with suffer

483
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,759
You'd not go out of this party office without apologizing to that great man.

484
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,079
That's not needed, Sudhakar. When did you come, Ragavan brother?

485
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,519
If you deny that, shouldn'tthey fall in your feet?

486
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,999
I won't accept for it. The one who committeda mistake, should get punished.

487
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,119
After burning a person'sprecious vehicle,

488
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,919
...is falling in his feet a greatpunishment for that?

489
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,839
Is that damaged scooter,so precious for you?

490
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,959
"Hey! If you degrade my bosshere, I will just watch it!

491
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,719
But if you degrade his scooter,I won't forgive you.

492
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,719
Prema! I've come for a compromise.Prema! Ivecome

493
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,079
If you people want to degrade my burnt scooter, I'll meet you all in the court.

494
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,879
You'd stand into the trial box & answer forlawyer's question. -Ragavan brother!

495
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,719
Can intelligent people like us do such a thing ina hurry for these immature boys acts?

496
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,079
Whether I am intelligent or not. If you pay meRs. 30,000, I can leave my court actions,

497
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,919
I'll be there in my shop. You'd tellme your decision very soon

498
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,519
Or I will approach thecourt. Come, man

499
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:21,279
Prakash! If anybody gets any problemin our gang, that's for everybody.

500
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,199

00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:15,279
So... -Let's quit this program -I'll slap you

Are you asking us to quit now?

583
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,839

We've promised Gopal brother as We would perform this program

587
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,359
It's not an easy matter.

588
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,759
If we can't save our promise, we will get a state of not saying anything hereafter.

00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,919
But I have some other confusion.

600
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,119
If they cause any confusion in our program, leave that matter be.

601
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,159

670
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,399
Where did you go?

671
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,119
We had gone to Thalasherry.

672
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:54,959
Did you go with Geetha?-Hey man! Then?

673
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:01,759
I took her to cool drink shop. -What didyou get her?--Lime juice.

676
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:19,999
What's this? Why didn't you wait somewhere until the rain gets stopped?

677
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,399
What, man?

678
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,999
Why is your face looking dull?

679
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,279
Son! You tell me the matter.

680
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:38,679
There was my dad's casejudgment today.

681
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,999
We've failed in our case.

682
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,679
Everybody has got a greatsuffer in my family

683
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:52,199
We have got credits from many people.We have got credits

684
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,679
We got to settle our bankloan also except that.

685
00:54:54,680 --> 00:55:00,079
'If we don't settle our debts soon, they will take over our house & land,

686
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,959
Son! Did you eat anything?

687
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,079
Let me bring something to eat.

688
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,239
Prakash! Can we arrangeany program?

689
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:23,559
Prakash! Can we arrangeany program?

690
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:32,519
We can try it. People in nearbyareas only know us. Right?

691
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,159
I can't see my mom & sisteron the street, man.

692
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:35,799
I can't see my mom & sisteron the street, man.

693
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,399
I want to do something.

694
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:46,199
Santhosh! If anybody gets any problemin between us, that's for all of us.

695
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,599
We won't just watch makingyou to suffer lonely

696
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,999
We will do what we can do.

697
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,359
You be brave.

698
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:10,399
Prakash! We got an idea accordingto Santhosh's problem.

699
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,799
What's that? We've seen a reality showcompetition in T.V in the tea shop.

700
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,159
It's a competition of selectingthe best singer.

701
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,999
Shall we make Santhosh to participate in that?

702
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,519
If he goes there, he will getselected definitely

703
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,719
If he gets popular, our presentsituation will get changed.

704
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:34,879
If he gets exposed in any reality show now,he will get a good musical platform

705
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,639
There's no other go at presentto help his family.

706
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,719
You do a thing you come to the tea shop along with him.

707
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,679
I will come there after when my dad comes here.

708
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,759
Okay.

709
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,119
Okay.

710
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,159
What do you say, guys?

711
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,839
How can I go? That too...In this situation

712
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,879
What's your problem?

713
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,399
People get matured while getting problems only.

714
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,799
Kumar brother...! But I...

715
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,439
Nothing. You can do it.

716
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:09,159
In your schooling when you step on the stageto sing, there will be pin drop silence.

717
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:13,319
What happened in your Malayur performance?People supported your program. Right?

718
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,639
When you started singing...!

719
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:23,159
Melting hundreds of people'sheart at a time, is an art.

720
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:26,159
I'm telling this as yougot that talent

721
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:31,399
Changing your family's fateis your responsibility.

722
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:36,479
You'd take this as an opportunity to get involved in your personal talent.

723
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,999
But the audition is there by tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock

724
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,639
Train won't be availablein this time

725
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:55,119
What can we do now?-We canfind a way for that.

726
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,999
If we go through by pass,we can reach there.

727
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,399
But I didn't renovate my jeep's insurance.

728
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,919
Will there be any police checking?

729
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,199
That won't be therein this time.

730
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,279
Santhosh! Shouldn't you take your dress?

731
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,319
You need to stay there only after when you get selected right?

732
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,519
If I go home now, I can'tcome out, then.

733
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,159
Whatever I say them in this state,nobody can understand me.

734
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:17,839
Purushu! You go home &bring your dresses.

735

739
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,599
But he got failed in S.S.L.C exam. Right?

740
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,839

00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:59,239
Kuttu! Break this. -Prakash!Do we need this?

He didn't save this for his sister's marriage.He saved this to enjoy in Goa.

743
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,359
Let us use that money for such a good matter.

He remembers old Manaseri school & foot ball ground only, when he gets Arabic salary.

When we become busy, shouldnit we also have some matters to remind like him?

865
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:33,959

882
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:23,039

Why didn't he call us?

891
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,239
He is making us tensed

892
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,759
If I call his father's mobile, nobody is picking up the call.

893
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,039
Might he have facedany problem?

894
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:11,679

895
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:22,719

897
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:28,039
They are disconnecting as soon as I ring them What can we do now?

898
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,999
If you think further, it will create a problem.

899
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,039
Your program time is 6:30 P.M. It's now 8 PMBut you guys didn't start it yet.

901
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,159
Praveen! You ask the orchestra people to step on the stage.

902
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:38,639
Ask them to start with their performances.

903
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,839
You include dance & mimics in between.

904
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:42,759
You go fast Purushu! You also go with him.

905
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:45,879
Don't forget to announce our sponsors name often.

906
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:49,119
You'd make them honour them onstage in the correct time gap.

907
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,239
Or we will face a great problem.

908
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:54,319
Okay. -Prakash! let me go & check whether police has come or not.

Here. Your mom gaveme this for you.

928
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:21,199
Why did you adopt Mangalapurijourney suddenly?

929
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:25,039
When I was upset in my house,I got this program

930
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:30,759
There's no any reason. I want to go out at present. I'd come here only, then. Right?

931
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,759
I've given my sister'schain & bangles...my sister's

933
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:39,279
For how many days I can be inhome without facing her?

934
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:50,439
'If my dad has argued with me, I'd havehurt that 60 years sick person.

935
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:00,479
Prakash! Santhosh calledme last night.

936
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,719
You man! He didn't knowanything truly

937
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:08,439
He took another program believing his dad'swords as our program got postponed

938
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,679
You man! He didn't lie to me.

939
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:16,119
He called me with a great suffer only.

940
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:20,319
How did he get time to suffer while running behind money?

941
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,399
We've planned everything according his words only. Right?

942
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,159
Why didn't he call us also?

943
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:30,119
You man! When he was busy...

944
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:33,759
Is he so busy in such a way he can'tremember his friends also?

945
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:39,359
He gave us a pain such as he hadhurt our hearts with a knife.

946
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,959
Whether he realizedthat or not...!

947
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,759
There's no any remedy for the loss we met.

948
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:46,959
AThere's no use in rememberingthat hereafter.

949
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,719
Let him go on his path. Let's go on our path.

950
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:09,439
Kumaran! I never had seen such a patient,who doesn't support us in my career.

951
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,639
You didn't take your medicines in time.

952
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,159
You didn't take careof your health

953
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:16,759
If we ask you to take any test, you won'tcome here for some days.

954
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:17,279
If we ask you to take any test, you won'tcome here for some days.

955
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:21,159
You have to take mywords serious.

956
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:24,719
Your B.P & cholesterol havegot increased more.

957
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:28,359
If you are not aware of your health henceforth,the consequence will be serious.

958
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:30,999
You'd do angiogram very soon.

959
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,959
You'd not be careless in this henceforth.You'd not be careless

960
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:39,439
If you ask me to take these tests,when I am financially weak...

961
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,439
There's no other unfairmore than thatThere's no other unfair

962
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:44,359
I have to keep somebodyto protect my house.

963
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:49,959
Orl have to see Mary Kutty's cemeteryland in some other's hands, then.

964
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:52,919
Making everybody to strain for me...Making everybody

965
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:56,599
Instead of disturbing everybodyto live in this 80 years...

966
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,719
Dying in this condition itself isbetter, isn't it, doctor?

967
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:04,999
I have got a goodness of offeringfood for 3 generations.

968
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:05,959
That's enough

969
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:06,599
That's enough

970
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:12,359
But my five sons...!

971
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:21,239
Why didn't you tell about the money to Prakash?

972
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:24,279
'He'd have got you that money in anywayas it is for your job. Right?

973
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:25,799
I don't have any objectionin it, man

974
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,559
You know his problems,don't you?

975
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,399
Brother. Do you have change for Rs. 1000/

976
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:36,239
Telling me...? Aman had gone withthat before 5 minutes only.

977
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:44,399
I don't remember Rs.1000note in colour also.

978
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,599
You man! This is notour story alone.

979
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:49,039
Praveen's state in Madras isvery worst than us.Praveen's state in Madras is

980
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:53,639
He is in a great difficulty in paying music academy fees & city accommodation. Right?

981
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:54,519
Definitely

982
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:57,679
How great jobs B.Sc low ranklist holders got?

983
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:00,279
We are in queue now also aswe didn't pay any bribe.

984
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:01,799
My name didn't come in list also

985
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,039
In which list? -Leave that.

986
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:04,919
Do you know swimming?

987
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:06,199
No. Why?

988
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:09,279
Nothing. If your Segali brotherdoesn't give us money...

989
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:11,359
We have to swim this river.

990
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:12,359
Nothing will take place like that.

991
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:15,799
My dad helped this Segali brother,when he started his business.

992
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:18,119
It's enough if he remembers that.

993
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:25,839
It's your lover's place. Right? -Yes.She told that she'd come here.

994
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,119
She may face some problems.

995
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,359
Girls are always problematic. Right?

996
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:33,079
She doesn't come & meet me. She doesn't call me & talk to me.

997
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:36,919
She told that they are discussing about hermarriage in her house now a days.

998
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:40,079
If everything comes together,what can I do?

999
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:46,199
د)حتنا

Aren't our beatings enough for you, man?

When you are to adamant to dump your desire on her?

1046
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:12,079
Instead of spoiling your own sister's life by joining her with a non suitable bridegroom...

1047
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:13,759
On whom do you showyour adamancy?

You can see many people, who blamethe fate & make fun of it.

1052
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:35,199
They won't have any money in hands.

1053
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,159
But they will have a great affection.

1054
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:39,039
There will be happiness & peace in between them.

1055
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:43,919
She won't get that happiness by your compulsion marriage.

1056
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:50,239
'If you expects Geethu's happiness,you'd not stop me.

1057
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:56,519
Let me take her wit the right of making her as my wife.

Why don't you take careof your health?

1137
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:12,199

1 Should anybody else come?

1146
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:27,279
Nobody should come henceforth.

1147
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:51,959
This person is the one, who showed him a successful path, when he was zero.

1148
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:54,799
He had hurt us by knife 2 days before.

1149
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:59,439
If he had little bit of gratefulnessat least, he'd have come.

You're the one, who came to supporthim on that day. Right?

01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:06,999
What do you think now?

1154
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:17,839
People will get changed, when they get richness, money & popularity.

1155
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:21,519
He's not the old Santhosh,who moved with us.

1156
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,879
We'd not think about him also henceforth

1157
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:38,599
You're not rightful forthat place also.

1158
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:39,239
What happened?

1159
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:40,119
There's a problem.

1160
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:44,359
Do you know about Kumaran brother's credits, which he got from someone?

1161
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:47,359
He didn't tell us anything.

1162
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:53,799
Kumaran brother gave a ring & a silk saree for Geethu on his marriage.

1163
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:56,799
He gave some money also forhis marriage expenses.

1164
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:59,799
What I heard is right, then-What happened?

1165
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:03,479
Kumaran brother got this moneyas credit from Financier Basi.

1166
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:08,279
He got Kumaran brother's signature in anempty paper & registered that also.

1167
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:09,439
Who told you this?

1168
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:14,639
When I went for hair cut in Dinesh's shop,Basi's person was there in that shop.

1169
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:17,319
When they were talking about Kumaran brother...

1170
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:18,559
He told this & I heard it

1171
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,359
TF we don't do anything

1172
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:27,399
Kumaran brother's house, tea shop & our arts club will become problem.

1173
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:31,879
There's another dangeralso in thissmotdanger-

1174
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:35,359
Prema was there, when thistalk was going on there.

1175
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:05,239
Basi! Money will come today & go tomorrow.

1176
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:07,839
But we'd not forgetthe humanity.

1177
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:13,319
That building is the blend of my lovableKumaran brother's blood & tears.

1178
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:15,239
Not for profit.

1179
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:20,399
I want to have that building as a museum to remember Kumaran brother always.

1180
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:23,479
I'll settle Kumaran brother's credit fully

1181
01:42:23,480 --> 01:42:25,959
You'd give me that document.

1182
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:43,639
I got Blade Basi name by my 25 years of hard work only.

1183
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:47,319
Are you asking me to spoil my fame by getting your money?

1184
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:51,679
Have you ever heard about Isaac Newton?

1185
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:53,799
Is he a ice vendor here?

1186
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:55,919
Good knowledge.

1187
01:42:55,920 --> 01:43:01,359
Isaac Newton. The one who thought looking-down, when an apple fell on the earth.

1188
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:02,599
Do you know what he said?

1189
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:07,319
Did you hear about reaction?

1190
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:10,319
Theard about betrayal. 4 knowas you have that character

1191
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:15,919
According to Newton's concept, an oppositereaction is necessary for every action

1192
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:17,959
I'm giving money.It's an action.

1193
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:20,199
Getting equivalent things for my money is the reaction.

1194
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:22,839
I won't act against the genius Newton's words, Ragava.

1195
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:25,919
At least remembering my late Kumaran brother...

1196
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:27,279
You don't tell his name also.

1197
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:31,799
You're not eligible for that.

1198
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:34,559
You've got down with false tearsto take over his wealth

1199
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:36,239
You tried to kill Kumaranbrother, didn't you?

1200
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:39,959
Is there such a story also?

1201
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:45,919
Hey! -Kumaran brother's tea shop & arts clubare not only buildings to sell for us.

1202
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:49,119
It's our life of 10 or 14 years.

1203
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:51,599
You'd give us that

1204
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:58,559
You tried to get it for a less amount andsell it for a huge amount, didn't you?

1205
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:04,839
Guys! I understand your feelings.

1206
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:07,679
But Isaac Newton hasbecome my guru.

1207
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:09,719
Action and reaction...!

1208
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:12,239
Giving credit & getting properties.

1209
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:15,399
Get me Rs.50000 &get the documents from me.

1210
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:19,039
Rs.50000...? But thathuge amount...!

1211
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:21,719
We... We will bring it.

1212
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,719
We will bring that money.

1213
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,839
In what belief you said that we would bring the money?

1214
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:30,399
From where can you bring it?

1215
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:32,799
There is a way for it.

1216
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:40,279
When I went to Madras Art associationmusical program last month...

1217
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:43,799
I went to Music Academy to meet my old masters.

1218
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:46,399
I had seen this genius guitar play there only

1219
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:48,239
I got stunned well!

1220
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:52,039
If you hadn't got me over phone, isn't it enough if you sent me a message at least?

1221
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:52,959
I'd have called you later on

1222
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:54,119
We didn't think that much sir

1223
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:57,239
We were in some sentimental suffersfrom the past 2 to 3 days.

1224
01:44:57,240 --> 01:45:00,359
We came to know your programhere last night only.

1225
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:02,199
That's why we have come hereto meet you immediately

1226
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:05,519
You man! In true I am not interested inmusical orchestra performances.

1227

Sir! You'd not tell like that

1228

Everybody wants to see you as -you didn't come there until now.

1233
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:35,599
Sir! You'd come there. If this doesn't take place, we'll lose our lovable things.

1234
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:45,359
What can I do, when a good artist comes & requests me like this?

1235
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:47,879
I'll come.

1236

01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:33,119
So ask your son to earnas much as he can.

1246

Our money is there inthis man's hands.

How many properties he bought after comingto Ernakulam from that corner!

1249

Dhamodharan is dealing the completefinance of Santhosh, isn't he?

1250
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:45,719

You Dhamodhara! We'dappreciate you!

1252
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:50,079
You keep quiet, Sivarasa.

1253

What is there in the name. Our propertieswill go to our children only. Right?

1254

I would like to talk abouta matter to my dad.

1257
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:37,959
I can't say anything to a father, who spoiled his own son's desires totally

1258
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:43,759
I don't have anger on a father, who is fullof selfishness & ungratefulness.

1259
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:45,399
I take pity on you.

1260
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:47,759
You said as the tea shop man has passed away, didn't you?

1261
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:55,999
That tea shop man is the cause for your new realestate business with these new friends.

1262
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,879
That tea shop man only made me tofind my interest on music.

1263
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:04,199
You didn't inform me about thatman's death also, did you?

1264
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:09,519
Person, who calculates othersproperties alone,

1265
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:11,639
...can't understand the value of relationships.

1266
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:13,639
You can't understand thevalue of affection.

1267
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:18,839
You had seen my arts club friendswith an irritation only.

1268
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:28,839
My life got changed by their smallsavings in a small pot only.

Our family's financialstate got changed.

1270
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:40,399
They helped me, when was a zero. I can'tlive forgetting them like you, dad.

1271
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,399
I'm not such an ungrateful person.

1272
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:47,639
Boys will learn from their fathers only.

1273
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:53,519
I also learnt from my dad as how a person should not be!

If you come to sing in Tabor-party's program...

1285
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:05,919
You won't come backalive, then

1286
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:10,599
If you think this as a joke now also...

1287
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:11,879
Just watch outside.

1288
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:12,319
Just watch outside.

1289
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:29,039
If you have any idea to give a police complaint,no any problem will get solved.

1290
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:33,559
We will revenge for the blood of our leader.

1291
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:35,679
I'll call you after 5 minutes.

1292
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:38,159
I should know your decision at that time.

1293
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:47,999
You've done well, man Do youknow mimicry also?

1296
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:55,759
!Did he fear? His bravery willget reduced totally.

1297
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:58,799
I deal him in the name of party problems, didn't11?

1298
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:02,359
Very good. Why did you ask himto see outside in between?

1299
01:51:02,360 --> 01:51:08,799
I asked our Mepur boys to just stand in front of that man's house with a jeep

1300
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,479
They both are useless guys.

1301
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:12,639
But if anybody sees them, they willfear thinking them as goondas.

1302
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:17,159
Those guys also don't know for what they are standing there. Pity!

1303
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:19,959
Whatever it is. Very good. Prema!You bring some drinks to sir.

01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:26,639
Am I right?

1307
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:32,639
He won't complaint in police, will he?

1308
01:51:32,640 --> 01:51:36,359
He is an ordinary singer. Right? He won'thave that much of guts.

1309
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:49,999
Sekara! 5 minutes are over.

1310
01:51:57,080 --> 01:51:58,639
What did you decide?

1311
01:51:58,640 --> 01:52:03,039
I... You'd answer me for my question, Mr. Rahul Menon.

1312
01:52:03,240 --> 01:52:07,279
What should I say, when they call me?

1313
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:09,559
You need not thinkabout that.

1314
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:10,879
You switch off your mobile,

1315
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:14,599
What? Do you have any objection to do like that?

1316
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:18,199
No. I'll do as you say.

1317
01:52:18,920 --> 01:52:23,679

01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:07,199
He only was convincing Gopalbrother until now.

1334
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:15,239

Can you do me a small favour?

1338
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:30,439
What's that, Gopal brother?

1339
01:53:30,440 --> 01:53:34,199
Can you get me Rs. 10000? I don't have money to pay for vehicle

1340
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:36,639
Committee people didn'tgive me any amount.

1341
01:53:37,320 --> 01:53:39,439
I'll return it to you immediatelyafter the program gets over

1342
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:43,719
Can you arrange it at present? -Let me try it, Gopal brother.

Don't show your anger on me. Don't ask me to go from here.

1354
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:05,839
I've come here from Ernakulam inorder to talk to you alone.

1355
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:09,879
If I can't tell this to you I won'thave peace at any day.

1356
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:10,359
If I can't tell this to you I won'thave peace at any day.

1357
01:55:12,360 --> 01:55:14,919
On the night, when Kumaran brother died...

1358
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:16,319
When Purushu brothercalled me...

1359
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:43,839
That tea shop man has passed away. Right?

1360
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:51,439
When my dad told that you postponed Kumaran brother's birthday program...

1361
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:52,919
My brother believed that.

1362
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:57,079
My brother didn't know that my dadcheated him by lying to him.

1363
01:55:58,680 --> 01:56:04,839
My brother didn't call up you & enquired. He remembered this later on & felt a lot.

1364
01:56:05,880 --> 01:56:09,759
Money & status have not changedmy brother until now.

1365
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:12,799
I didn't come hereto ask justice.

1366
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:16,519
I know as we can't get back whatever we lost.

1367
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:21,399
When you meet your old friend somewhere...

1368
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:24,119
'It's enough if you don't insult himshowing your irritation on him

1369
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:43,119
Prakash! Where are you?-I'm on the way.

1370
01:56:43,120 --> 01:56:44,039
Prakash! Where are you?Im on the way.

1371
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:46,399
You come fast immediately.

1372
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:48,999
There's a great confusion here.

1373
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:54,719
2010 എപ്രിയ 11, രി 7 മണി കോമാനം, ലളി

1374
01:57:02,160 --> 01:57:04,719
Gopala! It's not time for you to say so.

1375
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:06,079
The program is going to get started now. Are you delaying yet?

1376
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:08,519
Narayanan! Please excuse me.He will come now.

1377
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:11,279
He will come now. I'm hearingthese words from so long.

1378
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:12,959
There's a limit for excuse also.

1379
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:14,719
Ask him where he has come.

1380
01:57:14,720 --> 01:57:17,519
That's... -What?

1381
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:19,599
I called him over phone.I'd not get him

1382
01:57:21,200 --> 01:57:25,359
They can get Rahul Menon only if they have any contact with himRight?

1383
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:28,759
In what confidence you've giventhem such a great program?

1384
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:30,359
They are great frauds.

1385
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:32,879
Rahul Menon is there in foreigntrip from the past 2 days.

1386
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:34,879
How can he come to this program, then?

1387
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:36,319
Don't believe his words.

1388
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:38,319
We met that person in contact& spoke with him

1389
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:42,559
'He promised us that he'd comedefinitely. -Hey! You don't lie.

1390
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:44,039
Show the evidences first.

1391
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:46,839
Show us the agreement that he signedaccepting to come to this program

1392
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:48,999
If you don't have that show us the voucher for paying his advance, man.

1393
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:50,079
Show us that, man.

1394
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:52,039
What, man? Have youbecome a dumb?

1395
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:55,119
Brother! Whatever they say are true.

1396
01:57:55,120 --> 01:57:59,119
These guys didn't get any papersigned as they believed him.

1397
01:57:59,120 --> 01:58:01,439
As we didn't get any moneyfrom committee office...

1398
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:02,919
We could not give him any advance.

1399
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:07,519
You joined with them to loot that. Right?

1400
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:13,279
He is taking over others money for settlinghis daughter's wedding debts.

1401
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:15,439
You can even beg instead of this.

1402
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:17,879
You'd not talk anything further.

1403
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:18,719
NIf he talks, what canyou do, man?ishe talks, what can

1404
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:21,679
You take liquor, enjoy with girls & earn money in the name of party

1405
01:58:21,680 --> 01:58:23,719
To do what you came here?

1406
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:26,719
Save me! Save me!

1407
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:28,559
No. Don't fight.

1408
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:35,159
Leave me. How do you know that Rahul Menon has gone to foreign?

1409
01:58:35,160 --> 01:58:36,679
Tell me the truth, man.

1410
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:38,999
You've stopped his arrivalsecretly, haven't you?

1411
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:43,799
Kanna! No. -Move away,man. Move.

1412
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:45,599
The situation is becomingvery serious.

1413
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:46,359
You know the consequence...

1414
01:58:46,360 --> 01:58:49,239
...if we tell them as Rahul Menon won'tcome & program cancel?

1415
01:58:49,240 --> 01:58:51,879
KSS people are creatingconfusion already.

1416
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:54,559
If we delay further, everything will go beyond our hands.

1417
01:58:56,440 --> 01:59:00,559
If that singer doesn't come, you haveto answer to party & audiences.

1418
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:02,959
Do something before when people get angry.

1419
01:59:04,360 --> 01:59:05,639
Go, man.

1420
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:14,199
Gopal brother!

1421
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:14,879
Gopal brother!

1422
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:21,679
I stepped on the stagebefore 40 years.

1423
01:59:21,680 --> 01:59:26,439
I've come across many functions from that period, when I was playing Tabela

1424
01:59:27,480 --> 01:59:29,959
In those periods, when I hadan interest on music...

1425
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:34,399
I desired that I'd die on any stage only.

1426
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:37,359
That will take place today.

1427
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:49,999
Let's step on the stage.

1428
01:59:52,640 --> 01:59:56,639
Whether we step on the stage or not. Everything will be over today.

1429
01:59:56,640 --> 01:59:59,519
People will becomeagainst of us.

1430
02:00:00,680 --> 02:00:03,079
We will lose our Malarvadiarts club once for all.

1431
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:07,399
We'd have predicted Ragavan'sdeceit already.

1432
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:08,839
There's no use in telling that now.

1433
02:00:10,760 --> 02:00:14,559
Didn't you hear that if we have to lose something, we can't get it back at any cost?

1434
02:00:15,120 --> 02:00:20,079
We got into a matter together. You guysdidn't expect this, did you?

1435
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:24,839
Whatever it is, Prakash. Whether we hit othersor get beaten by others, we'd be united

1436
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:33,639
We can sing as the final program of Malarvadi is going to get performed by us.

1437
02:01:12,360 --> 02:01:14,439
