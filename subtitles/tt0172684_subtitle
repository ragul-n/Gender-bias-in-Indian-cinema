1
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,963
Hey Rahul !
Want to be friends ?

2
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:09,838
She's just like her
father. Isn't she ?

3
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:14,386
Tina's very critical Rahul.

4
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,121
She doesn't have much time.

5
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,558
We tried our best.

6
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:22,256
She had severe internal bleeding.
We couldn't do anything.

7
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:27,294
She knew there would be
complications in her delivery.

8
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:31,001
She also knew how much you
wanted this child.

9
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,838
She loved this baby more
than her life.

10
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,905
I want my daughterto now me.

11
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:43,208
Who her motherwas,
what she was like.

12
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,913
I want herto be able to answer
all these questions herself.

13
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:54,122
I am leaving these 8 letters
for her...

14
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,597
...1 each of her 1st
8 birthdays.

15
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,930
These letters have everything
that I want to tell my daughter

16
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,304
These letters are going
to be her memories.

17
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,823
You are very bad.

18
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:33,658
You are very bad.

19
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:53,980
Rahul, Want to be friends?

20
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:04,662
Promise me you will never cry.

21
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:19,845
Anyways, you look very bad
when you cry.

22
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,691
Also promise me that...

23
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:43,634
...you'll name our daughter
Anjali.

24
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:55,542
I am sorry Rahul.
I am really sorry.

25
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,578
Don't go.

26
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,442
Promise me you'll name
our daughter Anjali.

27
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,760
Hi! I am Anjali...

28
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:42,785
...and you're watching
channel Anjali.

29
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,765
I am going to grow up
and be a V. J...

30
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,899
...you know just like
Neelam.

31
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,868
Hey cut cut cut.

32
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,637
Ooops l'll be back
afterthe break.

33
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,163
My hobbies are eating
chocolates...

34
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,800
...beating up boys,
irritating granny...

35
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,677
...and reading mom's letters.

36
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,549
Hey I'm late.

37
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,848
I have to get ready and
go to meet papa.

38
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,357
Watch me.

39
00:08:36,781 --> 00:08:40,514
Hi, Anjali, listen to me.
Look.

40
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,010
Look... I'm only...

41
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:46,691
...2 hours late.

42
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,423
Right.
- Okay. Sorry. I was busy.

43
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,629
So was I.

44
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,722
I haven't even watched
television today...

45
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,357
...because I had to come
to do your shopping.

46
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:03,668
I can't handle everything.
I'm your daughter not yourwife.

47
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:08,547
Why?

48
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,015
Lf I can be both your dad
and mom...

49
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:14,847
...why can't you be both...
Okay.

50
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,263
What?
- Felt bad?

51
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,630
A bit.

52
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:29,098
Sorry
- Okay.

53
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,506
That is why one says...

54
00:09:36,507 --> 00:09:39,345
...there is only one god
in many forms.

55
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:43,975
No matterwhat form,
he knows our devotion.

56
00:09:45,516 --> 00:09:48,577
It is important to keep
this bond with god.

57
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,086
She speaks so well, doesn't she?

58
00:09:52,156 --> 00:09:54,893
So, that's all fortoday

59
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,696
Now we'll have...

60
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,730
I got this gift for
St. Valentine's day

61
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:01,999
Rupa!
- Me?

62
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,025
Rupa will chant the
divine hymn.

63
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,037
Me?

64
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,471
Chant Rupa.

65
00:10:09,007 --> 00:10:11,067
The divine hymn...
I forgot it.

66
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,013
What?
What are you saying Rupa?!

67
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:18,472
Can you believe that sisters?
She has forgotten the divine hymn.

68
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:22,483
My dear if you don't pay
attention to prayer...

69
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:24,923
...what will you teach
your children.

70
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,124
The way we think and
the things we say...

71
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,288
...have a deep impact
on our children.

72
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,290
Granny.

73
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:36,534
Speaking of children...
Namaste. Hi! Sexy.

74
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,308
Who taught you that?
- Papa.

75
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:54,686
Go get ready for your
School function.

76
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:57,348
Granny... the letter.

77
00:10:58,189 --> 00:11:00,986
When is your birthday?
- Tomorrow.

78
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,365
Come on, hurry up.

79
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:11,068
Yes, there are our seats.
- Come sit.

80
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:13,538
Come Mr. Khanna, sit.

81
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:20,778
Good evening ladies
and gentlemen.

82
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:23,611
Welcome to the Just
one-minute competition.

83
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:28,082
It's a strange competition. Children
have to talk on the stage...

84
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:32,818
...and the topic is given right
there in some strange bowl.

85
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:35,823
On the spot sir, on the spot.

86
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,323
Stop it Balbir, control yourself.
- Never mind. It's ok.

87
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,269
Every student will be given only
one minute. Just one minute.

88
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:48,928
Just One Minute?
Only one minute to speak?

89
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,241
Exactly. Very unfair.

90
00:11:51,242 --> 00:11:53,837
But yet ourJassu wins
every year.

91
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,581
She's so talented you know.

92
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:59,249
Best of luck Jaswinder.
- Same to you.

93
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,985
OurJaswinder is the best.

94
00:12:01,986 --> 00:12:04,115
Actually Anjali is also
taking part.

95
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:06,758
She'll come second.
Don't worry.

96
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,027
Thank you.
- Oh welcome!

97
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,553
Our first contestant is
Jaswinder Singh.

98
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:15,261
Oh! My sweetheart.

99
00:12:26,477 --> 00:12:28,145
My topic is Prayer.

100
00:12:28,146 --> 00:12:30,876
Every morning we pray
to the lord.

101
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:35,548
Papa says prayers will
keep god happy...

102
00:12:35,987 --> 00:12:38,956
...and he will protect us.

103
00:12:38,957 --> 00:12:42,483
Mummy says that by praying
Grandma will get impressed...

104
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,293
...and will leave the big
house for us in the will.

105
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:53,728
Prayer... yes, my favourite
actress's name is Puja...

106
00:12:54,305 --> 00:12:56,639
...and even my best friend's
name is Puja.

107
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,044
Wow! My daughter is
the best.

108
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:04,014
Next we have Anjali Khanna.

109
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,708
Pick yourtopic.

110
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,819
Second!

111
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,934
Yourtimer starts now.

112
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,048
Say!

113
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,890
Mother!

114
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,669
Mother!

115
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,343
Mother!

116
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:23,891
I am sorry.

117
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:26,861
Mother...

118
00:14:34,405 --> 00:14:38,000
A mother is someone
who loves us so much...

119
00:14:39,544 --> 00:14:42,978
...that we sometimes can't
understand it.

120
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:48,343
A mother is someone who makes
us realise how good we are...

121
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:53,524
...there is no one better
than us.

122
00:14:54,425 --> 00:14:58,385
Her happiness is in our
laughter...

123
00:15:00,131 --> 00:15:03,293
...and sorrow in our
sorrow.

124
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:07,765
She is someone we can't
live without...

125
00:15:08,506 --> 00:15:11,375
...she is everything.

126
00:15:14,178 --> 00:15:17,202
Only we don't have her.

127
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:25,313
But we have papa, and
he is quite nice too.

128
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,696
Then you give me a hug.

129
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,789
That's number one!

130
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:56,819
Rahul, you remember
Mr. Shama? He had phoned.

131
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,822
Who?

132
00:15:58,823 --> 00:16:01,155
Our neighbour in Delhi.
He has sent a proposal.

133
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,126
Forwhom?

134
00:16:03,127 --> 00:16:05,857
Me.
Shut up.

135
00:16:08,366 --> 00:16:10,857
He said the girl is
sweet and beautiful...

136
00:16:11,502 --> 00:16:13,803
...but I refused flatly.

137
00:16:13,804 --> 00:16:16,573
I did the right thing, didn't I?
- Yes.

138
00:16:16,574 --> 00:16:19,244
I did the right thing?
- Yes.

139
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,711
I was right?

140
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:24,648
Yes mom.

141
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:26,981
Well I must have done
the right thing.

142
00:16:28,252 --> 00:16:31,049
I never do anything wrong.

143
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,524
So what if the girl is
sweet and beautiful.

144
00:16:37,295 --> 00:16:39,355
Everyone is beautiful these days.

145
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,332
Who wants to get married?
Mr. Sharma has gone mad.

146
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,227
Keeps sending me proposals.

147
00:16:47,271 --> 00:16:50,500
Why doesn't he get himself married
and just leave me alone.

148
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:00,442
What's wrong mom?

149
00:17:00,718 --> 00:17:05,052
I just find this family
incomplete.

150
00:17:06,991 --> 00:17:11,520
Why? You are there.
L'am there...

151
00:17:12,196 --> 00:17:15,495
...Anjali is there, I don't
find it incomplete.

152
00:17:18,302 --> 00:17:21,603
When I go out with my
friends...

153
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:25,009
...they all complain about
their daughters-in-law.

154
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,703
I can't even do that.

155
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:33,213
This is a big problem.

156
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:37,049
So you need a daughter-in-law
to complain about.

157
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:46,088
No son.
I just want you to be happy.

158
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:51,259
I am happy mom.

159
00:17:55,473 --> 00:17:58,463
So you won't marry again?

160
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:11,952
Mom, we live once, die once,
get married once...

161
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,125
...and love once.

162
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:23,462
We don't do these again.

163
00:18:23,934 --> 00:18:27,802
You are fine, but what
of Anjali.

164
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:33,103
Why? What's happened to her?

165
00:18:34,311 --> 00:18:37,712
You don't feel she needs
a mother?

166
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,248
She's okay.

167
00:18:48,426 --> 00:18:51,052
She's just fine.

168
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:59,426
She's got something which
even I don't have.

169
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,000
Her mother's letters.

170
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:18,014
Happy Birthday Anjali.

171
00:19:39,677 --> 00:19:41,838
My dear, Anjali.
Happy Birthday Anjali.

172
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,682
You are 8 years old today.

173
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,346
I'm sure you look just
like your dad.

174
00:19:48,452 --> 00:19:50,750
That same smile, those
same eyes.

175
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:54,480
No. I look like you.

176
00:19:56,427 --> 00:19:59,792
Does your father still go
Old habits die-hard.

177
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:07,500
Today you are a big girl and
you will be able to understand...

178
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:10,775
...what I have to tell you.

179
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,835
Today, I will tell you a story...

180
00:20:13,677 --> 00:20:16,610
...about your father, me and
Anjali.

181
00:20:19,617 --> 00:20:21,846
Anjali?

182
00:20:44,408 --> 00:20:46,175
You're late again.

183
00:20:46,176 --> 00:20:48,244
Can't wake up so early.

184
00:20:48,245 --> 00:20:50,907
Can't wake up orwere
you scared.

185
00:20:53,183 --> 00:20:56,446
Rahul Khanna is never
scared.

186
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:02,292
But loses to Anjali Sharma
everyday in Basketball.

187
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:06,663
Don't want to play?

188
00:21:06,664 --> 00:21:09,098
What's the point, you
will lose again.

189
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:13,127
I won't lose today.
- You say that everyday.

190
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,299
We'll see.

191
00:21:18,175 --> 00:21:20,644
We'll see.

192
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:55,905
If you can't play
atleast don't cheat.

193
00:22:55,906 --> 00:22:59,135
Don't call me a cheater.

194
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:03,646
Anjali, don't call me
a cheater.

195
00:23:03,647 --> 00:23:05,650
Rahul is a cheater

196
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:07,984
He is a cheater, cheater.

197
00:23:07,985 --> 00:23:10,885
I am not a cheater.
- Cheater.

198
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,528
Stop screaming like a girl.
- Hey! Don't call me a girl.

199
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,498
You're right, you're not a girl.

200
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,932
Atleast betterthan those
girls you run after.

201
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:26,500
Excuse me! I don't run after
them, they run after me.

202
00:23:27,137 --> 00:23:29,605
Wow! Rahul's so cute.
- Yes.

203
00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:33,007
He's so sweet, he's so
handsome.

204
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:36,480
Not as handsome as you,
you have a better moustache.

205
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:38,147
Was that a joke?
- What if it was?

206
00:23:38,148 --> 00:23:40,878
I don't like jokes.
- I don't like you.

207
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,655
Shut up

208
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:50,894
Rahul and Anjali have
fought again.

209
00:23:50,895 --> 00:23:52,261
Rahul and Anjali have
fought again.

210
00:23:52,262 --> 00:23:54,163
Rahul and Anjali
have fought.

211
00:23:54,164 --> 00:23:56,733
Rahul and Anjali
have fought again.

212
00:23:56,734 --> 00:24:00,202
"What sort of a boy is this?"

213
00:24:01,972 --> 00:24:04,238
"What sort of a girl is this?"

214
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,738
"What do I do with him?"

215
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:15,450
"What do I say to her?"

216
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:18,749
"He fights with me!"

217
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:21,483
"She irritates me!"

218
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:22,759
"He troubles me"

219
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,260
"She gets upset"

220
00:24:24,261 --> 00:24:25,497
"He is crazy"

221
00:24:25,498 --> 00:24:27,895
"She is crazy"

222
00:24:27,932 --> 00:24:30,990
"But he is your best friend dear"

223
00:24:31,068 --> 00:24:34,001
"But she is your best friend dear"

224
00:25:17,514 --> 00:25:20,508
"Oh my! Oh my! This boy.
Oh my! Oh my!"

225
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,451
"Why does he play these pranks?
Ask him please, why"

226
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:36,897
"Sometime he fights with me,
sometime he quarrels with me"

227
00:25:37,668 --> 00:25:40,569
"Stay away from him"

228
00:25:41,472 --> 00:25:45,932
"This boy is crazy"

229
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,168
"Crazy... Crazy..."

230
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,885
"Oh my! Oh my! This girl
Oh my! Oh my!"

231
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:03,850
"Why does she play these pranks?
Ask her please, why"

232
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:06,896
"Sometimes she fights with me"

233
00:26:06,897 --> 00:26:08,664
"Sometimes she irritates"

234
00:26:08,665 --> 00:26:11,793
"Trouble her, but only
from a distance"

235
00:26:12,636 --> 00:26:16,936
"This girl is crazy.
Crazy... Crazy..."

236
00:27:02,552 --> 00:27:05,077
"Only she understands
what she says"

237
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:09,489
"No one else can
figure that out"

238
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:12,892
"She's like this
and she's like that"

239
00:27:14,031 --> 00:27:16,898
"No one can figure her out"

240
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:24,604
"So run for your life,
she is surely upto some mischief"

241
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:29,643
"This girl is crazy.
Crazy... Crazy..."

242
00:27:33,183 --> 00:27:37,847
"This boy is crazy.
Crazy... Crazy..."

243
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:23,595
"He teases us
as he comes by"

244
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:27,604
"He does not listen"

245
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:34,711
"Look, look, he is crazy
beware of him"

246
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:43,049
"He is weird and yet
he is dearto me"

247
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:48,518
"This boy is crazy.
Crazy... Crazy..."

248
00:28:51,762 --> 00:28:55,926
"This girl is crazy.
Crazy... Crazy..."

249
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:34,125
Oh God! Just look at
this room. Filthy.

250
00:30:34,664 --> 00:30:37,030
These girls will drive
me crazy.

251
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:40,672
Hey! What is this mountain
on your head?

252
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:44,404
These are rollers, Rifat bi

253
00:30:45,742 --> 00:30:48,973
Rollers don't impress boys.
You can take that from me.

254
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:52,882
Then how do they get impressed,
Rifat bi.

255
00:30:54,818 --> 00:30:57,721
Oh god! What are you wearing?

256
00:30:58,257 --> 00:31:00,691
Come on tell us.
- I don't know.

257
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,161
Tell us please.
- No!

258
00:31:03,162 --> 00:31:05,923
Tell us.

259
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:10,896
Okay! Boys get impressed by
a girl's mannerisms...

260
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,729
...herwalk, hertalk
And?

261
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,211
And I don't know.

262
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:25,341
You girls talk to much.
Come on, clean up this mess.

263
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:30,481
God! What do I do with
this girl, Anjali, what is this?

264
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:33,355
What are you wearing?

265
00:31:33,356 --> 00:31:35,224
Lt's cool Rifat bi.

266
00:31:35,225 --> 00:31:38,388
Cool? Try to be feminine once
in a while atleast.

267
00:31:39,062 --> 00:31:41,259
Not like them but...

268
00:31:41,965 --> 00:31:44,366
Rifat bi, you say the
same thing everyday.

269
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:47,836
You know, I beat Rahul
in basketball again.

270
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:50,208
Stay away from that boy.

271
00:31:50,209 --> 00:31:52,608
Why? He is my best friend.
He is my buddy.

272
00:31:52,609 --> 00:31:54,443
When best friend becomes
boy friend...

273
00:31:54,444 --> 00:31:56,913
- one doesn't even get to know.
- Rahul? Please.

274
00:31:58,115 --> 00:31:59,715
Yes, yes. I know all about that.

275
00:31:59,716 --> 00:32:01,518
Here I've got you some pudding.
Don't tell anyone.

276
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,114
Oh! Thank you Rifat bi.
- Leave me, mad girl.

277
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,955
No short skirts in the
college please.

278
00:32:19,636 --> 00:32:21,770
Good morning Ms. Briganza.

279
00:32:21,771 --> 00:32:25,038
Good morning boys,
Nice colour Piyush.

280
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:29,211
L'll complain to your
parents that...

281
00:32:29,212 --> 00:32:31,407
...you wear short skirts to
college in orderto excite the boys.

282
00:32:32,349 --> 00:32:34,749
Excuse me!

283
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:38,413
I said no short skirts
in college please.

284
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,452
Oh! Ms. Briganza.

285
00:32:44,561 --> 00:32:47,289
You said something Malhotra?

286
00:32:47,397 --> 00:32:51,731
Oh! I was just saying, that short
skirts are not allowed in college.

287
00:32:52,502 --> 00:32:55,232
What? But this is the
latest fashion...

288
00:32:55,972 --> 00:32:58,807
...infact, some girls don't
even wear skirts these days.

289
00:33:00,243 --> 00:33:02,973
Don't tell me Ms. Briganza.
- Yes!

290
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:10,252
And am I not looking
nice today?

291
00:33:10,253 --> 00:33:12,519
You're very queet. Queet?

292
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,291
Cute.

293
00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:18,225
You're very cute.

294
00:33:19,896 --> 00:33:24,096
But if you expose like this,
then these youngsters...

295
00:33:24,668 --> 00:33:27,537
What do you mean by these youngsters.
Am I not young?

296
00:33:29,572 --> 00:33:32,801
You're... young. Very young.

297
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,437
But you wear very boring
clothes.

298
00:33:36,513 --> 00:33:42,750
I Know. Till Mrs. Malhotra
was alive...

299
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:46,683
...I would occasionally wear
fancy clothes.

300
00:33:47,223 --> 00:33:48,459
Really?

301
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:51,895
But now there is no point.
- What do you mean?

302
00:33:54,664 --> 00:34:01,798
Mr. Malhotra... Ms. Briganza...
Mrs. Malhotra.

303
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:15,317
Happy friendship day.

304
00:34:15,318 --> 00:34:17,420
Sharma. Always scaring me.

305
00:34:17,421 --> 00:34:19,651
What are you doing now.
- It's a friendship band sir.

306
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:22,452
Besides being your student,
I am also your friend now.

307
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,929
Oh! Good!

308
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:29,160
Sir, you look very happy today.

309
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:31,836
What do you mean?
- Just generally.

310
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,667
Oh! Generally. Well, my daughter
is coming home today.

311
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:38,509
Your daughter?
- Tina.

312
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,576
- She is coming back from London.
- From London?

313
00:34:40,577 --> 00:34:42,913
She was studying at
Oxford University.

314
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,483
Oxford University?

315
00:34:45,484 --> 00:34:47,717
We used to all live there.

316
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:51,211
But when Mrs. Malhotra died,
I couldn't stay there anymore.

317
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:55,088
- So I came back to my country.
- Tina didn't come back with you?

318
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:58,718
No. She had to finish
her education.

319
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:03,825
But I miss her, so I told her
to complete her final year...

320
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:07,805
...in our college, after all
we are no less than Oxford.

321
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:10,507
Yes Sir!

322
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:12,568
You'll take care of Tina, won't you?
- Of course sir.

323
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:16,606
Happy friendship day.
- Thank you sir.

324
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:19,147
Who? Rahul?

325
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:22,778
Yes! I'm the first girl forwhom
Rahul has tied a friendship band.

326
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:27,287
Isn't it exciting.
- Of course.

327
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,756
You know I am tying a friendship
band only for you.

328
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,434
Really Rahul?
- Really Sonia.

329
00:35:36,435 --> 00:35:38,436
That is because you're the
nicest...

330
00:35:38,437 --> 00:35:40,204
...and most beautiful girl
I've known.

331
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:43,007
Really Rahul?
- Really Sonia.

332
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:45,272
Oh Rahul! You are telling
the truth, aren't you?

333
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:50,140
Really Tanya.
- My name's Sonia.

334
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:55,008
See! I got so lost in
your eyes, I forgot your name.

335
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,680
I just can't believe this Rahul.
- Trust me.

336
00:35:59,057 --> 00:36:00,991
Oh Rahul!
- Oh Sonia!

337
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,220
Oh Rahul!

338
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:24,506
These fell off.
- You cheat, you liar.

339
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:31,584
Hey come on... Tanya...
What's your name?

340
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:35,925
Sonia.
- Go away! Wasted my half-hour.

341
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,992
You don't get tired running
afterthese stupid girls.

342
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:41,998
Hey! I don't run after...

343
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:48,530
I know. Can't you find one girl
with beauty and brains?

344
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,939
Beauty and brains?

345
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:57,845
Where will I find
such a girl?

346
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:05,216
I'm only passing my time with these
girls. I haven't found her as yet.

347
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:07,590
Her?

348
00:37:07,591 --> 00:37:09,818
Her.

349
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:17,861
I'm looking for a girl who
makes something happen.

350
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:21,304
Makes what happen?

351
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:23,507
Makes something happen
in my heart.

352
00:37:23,508 --> 00:37:26,236
Makes what happen?

353
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:32,116
Something happens.

354
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:34,743
You won't understand.

355
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:41,256
When she walks, the
world looks on.

356
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:49,292
And when she stops, time stops.

357
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:56,206
And when she smiles...

358
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,731
She, she, she. What will you
do when you find her?

359
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:03,642
What will I do?
- Yes.

360
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:09,877
L'll kneel down in front of
her, spread my arms and say...

361
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:13,885
...Hey! Whoever you are...
I love you.

362
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:30,574
I love you.
- Sorry?

363
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:32,909
Don't be. I love you.

364
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,309
Excuse me.

365
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,877
Tina!

366
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:44,355
Tina.

367
00:38:44,356 --> 00:38:46,481
Hi! I'm Anjali and you are...

368
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:48,925
Rahul.

369
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:51,427
Tina! Right?
- How do you know?

370
00:38:51,428 --> 00:38:52,929
This morning the principal...

371
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,632
Ya! Ya! Don't take that old slob's
name first thing in the morning.

372
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:58,033
So Tina! Your first day in
college?

373
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:01,105
Yes. She just got back from London.
- How do you know?

374
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:02,873
Rahul, this morning the
principal...

375
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:05,175
I just told you not to talk
about that baldy.

376
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,177
Baldy!
- So Tina...

377
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,202
- Where were you studying in London?
- Oxford University.

378
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,882
Ox... How do you know?

379
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:13,483
Rahul, this morning the
principal...

380
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:16,113
Yeah! Yeah! Let the
Baldy be.

381
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:19,013
We have this grouch of
a Principal. She's his fan.

382
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:21,816
Grouch?
- Grouch is right. But forget him.

383
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:24,962
Tell me how is your
first day in college?

384
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:27,191
Great.

385
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:29,859
Good morning Archana.

386
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:32,560
Feroze... cut your hair.

387
00:39:32,635 --> 00:39:34,637
Short skirt... Oh god.

388
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:37,868
There's groucho.
Morning Sir.

389
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:44,037
Short skirts are not allowed
in college, you know that?

390
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:46,449
You know I just got back
from London...

391
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,008
...and haven't had the time
to unpack.

392
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:53,991
Sir, it's Tina's first day here,
she's just gotten back...

393
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:56,126
...from London and hasn't had
the time to unpack.

394
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,561
- She wore whatever she could find.
- And how do you know that?

395
00:39:58,562 --> 00:39:59,996
Sir, I've known Tina
since childhood.

396
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:01,699
Since childhood? Really?

397
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,928
Really Papa.
- Really Pa... Papa?

398
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:10,803
Mr. Malhotra I need you here.

399
00:40:11,341 --> 00:40:14,673
Not there sir, in the
staff room.

400
00:40:25,722 --> 00:40:29,818
He's an old slob, a baldy,
and a g...

401
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:33,197
Great? Good?

402
00:40:33,198 --> 00:40:36,394
Grouch. But he's not
all that bad.

403
00:40:42,972 --> 00:40:45,702
Happy friendship day.

404
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:48,475
We've only just met,
friendship is a farthought.

405
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:00,757
So... something happened?

406
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,783
No, she's not my sort.
- Why?

407
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:06,486
She's not Indian enough.
She's born and brought up in England.

408
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:09,632
And these London returns
are little weird.

409
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,535
A girl should be one you can
take home to your mother.

410
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,729
No. She's not my type.

411
00:41:17,242 --> 00:41:21,406
She's not my type.
You won't find anyone this way.

412
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,280
Why? You're there.

413
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:26,617
Me? Just shut up.

414
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:28,884
If I don't find anyone else,
l'll marry you.

415
00:41:28,885 --> 00:41:32,115
See. Anyway no one will
marry you.

416
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,744
Here, this is for you.
What's this?

417
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:56,112
This is our college sweatshirt.
Cool?

418
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:58,843
Thanks.
Anjali... May I ask you something?

419
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,472
Sure.

420
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:05,019
Why is everyone staring at me?

421
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,314
Why the boys are staring,
you know!

422
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,321
And the girls are wondering
what the boys are staring at...

423
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:15,059
...and that is why even they
are staring at you.

424
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:18,936
And look if you have any
problems...

425
00:42:18,937 --> 00:42:21,237
...just come to me or
to Rahul.

426
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:22,538
Rahul? The one who yesterday...

427
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:26,169
Yeah! He's my best friend and
we sort of rule this college.

428
00:42:32,684 --> 00:42:35,173
This is Rahul.

429
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:40,456
We have a rule in this college.

430
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:43,789
We make every newcomer sing.
You know Do Re Me...

431
00:42:46,464 --> 00:42:48,998
Rahul, she's the principal's
daughter.

432
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:51,992
So! We can't break our rules
for anyone. Right?

433
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,970
But Rahul?
- Shut up,

434
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:12,749
You have to sing a song for us,
forthis college, in Hindi.

435
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:15,515
Hindi?

436
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:19,630
Why you forgot how to speak
Hindi in London, is it?

437
00:43:19,631 --> 00:43:22,099
Sorry! One minute.

438
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,067
Rahul how can she sing
a Hindi song?

439
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:26,369
Why? She's the principal's
daughter.

440
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:28,070
If he can't teach her
then how will he teach us...

441
00:43:28,071 --> 00:43:31,231
...and you shut up.

442
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:35,470
So, Tina, you will sing
a song in Hindi...

443
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:40,542
...and fast because we don't
have much time. Right?

444
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:42,803
Living in London and studying
and growing up there...

445
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:46,341
...has not made me forget
my roots...

446
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,376
...and you don't forget that.

447
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:39,156
Hey! You're sitting in my place.
- Oh! I'm sorry.

448
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:42,693
No it's okay. Hey Adi move.

449
00:46:44,669 --> 00:46:46,503
Good morning class.

450
00:46:46,504 --> 00:46:48,870
Good morning Ms. Briganza.

451
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:03,914
Today we are going to start
a new lesson - Romeo & Juliet.

452
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:07,979
An eternal love story.

453
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:12,361
Before we begin, I want to
ask you all ...

454
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:15,524
...What is Love?

455
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:29,843
Tina? You tell us,
What is love?

456
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:33,743
Me? I don't know.

457
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:40,084
You tell us, what is love?

458
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:42,419
Love?

459
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:50,258
Anyone?

460
00:47:51,334 --> 00:47:55,135
Rahul... What is love?

461
00:48:00,278 --> 00:48:02,767
Love is friendship.

462
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:09,542
If she can't be my best friend,
I can't be in love with her.

463
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:14,316
Without friendship there is no love.

464
00:48:15,091 --> 00:48:17,818
Love is friendship.

465
00:48:31,106 --> 00:48:33,838
Thank you for sharing
that with us Rahul.

466
00:48:34,946 --> 00:48:37,970
Love is friendship.

467
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:47,314
So! Want to be friends?

468
00:49:22,827 --> 00:49:25,385
Oh my head! My feet.

469
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,524
Oh Sorry Mr. Malhotra,
Ms. Briganza here.

470
00:49:34,437 --> 00:49:36,306
I hope I didn't disturb you...

471
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:38,365
...and even if I did
I'm sure you don't mind.

472
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,846
Of course not Ms. Briganza.

473
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:47,510
I called to tell you that
the rehearsals are complete...

474
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:51,318
...and our college will
come first tomorrow.

475
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,847
Rest of the teams don't stand
a chance. You know what I mean.

476
00:49:56,227 --> 00:49:58,994
This is all because of
you Ms. Briganza.

477
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:02,230
And it's all for you Malhotra.

478
00:50:02,231 --> 00:50:04,733
Really Ms. Briganza?

479
00:50:04,734 --> 00:50:06,469
Really Malhotra.

480
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:09,403
Oh Ms. Briganza.

481
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:14,702
Oh! I have fallen.

482
00:50:14,812 --> 00:50:19,214
And the next college is
our college... St. Xavier's.

483
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:37,624
What! Oh my god.
They can't make it?

484
00:50:38,002 --> 00:50:40,060
Ms. Briganza, there is a
curfew in their area...

485
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:43,332
...and they can't leave.
Now what do we do?

486
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:52,972
Mr. Malhotra let me think
please. Idea...

487
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:55,678
Idea.

488
00:50:57,321 --> 00:50:59,845
You have to do this or else
you both are going to fail.

489
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:03,986
Bur Sir, how can we sing and dance.
We don't know anything.

490
00:51:04,627 --> 00:51:08,118
You know these students,
they will skin us alive.

491
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:12,668
Of course it's a good idea.
Nothing will happen to you.

492
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:14,536
The students who were
going to perform today...

493
00:51:14,537 --> 00:51:17,206
...have recorded a tape of
their rehearsals.

494
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:22,611
L'll play that tape and
you just have to move your lips.

495
00:51:24,013 --> 00:51:26,073
Like in the films. Okay.

496
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:28,918
It won't work.

497
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,554
What do you mean it won't
work. Of course it will work.

498
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:33,852
My name is Chin Chin Chu

499
00:51:34,557 --> 00:51:37,082
Moonlit sky, you and me,
Hello Mr. How do you do?

500
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:56,446
Anjali, you don't have any concern
forthe reputation of your college?

501
00:52:03,952 --> 00:52:06,443
Come on Rahul, it is for
the college.

502
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:16,026
Come on, help us Tina.
- No, I'm not coming.

503
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:19,260
What are you saying?

504
00:52:19,937 --> 00:52:22,903
Why are you asking her?
Let's go.

505
00:52:43,127 --> 00:52:45,061
What do I play?
This must be it.

506
00:52:45,062 --> 00:52:48,361
"You are a foreigner,
You are a foreigner,

507
00:52:53,903 --> 00:52:57,464
You won't be here with us
for long..."

508
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,709
Looks like, I have put the
wrong tape.

509
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,711
"I found someone"

510
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:21,318
"I found someone"

511
00:54:23,794 --> 00:54:26,318
"I found someone?"

512
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:59,258
"What's come over me?"

513
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:02,591
"Why do I feel so lost?"

514
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:09,606
"Either I was insane earlier
Or I've just become so."

515
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:16,970
"Dreamy eyes and unkempt hair,
What have you done to yourself."

516
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:20,638
"I found someone..."

517
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:24,149
"I've lost my heart..."

518
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:27,888
"What can I tell you my friends..."

519
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:30,885
"I am all shook up..."

520
00:55:31,794 --> 00:55:34,921
"I've found someone..."

521
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:24,439
"I don't know
what's happened to me?"

522
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:27,839
"People have begun
calling me Romeo."

523
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,771
"And why is that so?
We should also know."

524
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:35,451
"What's happened to you?"

525
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:38,510
"Till yesterday I was
quite fine."

526
00:57:39,256 --> 00:57:41,986
"My heart was filled with
happiness divine."

527
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:45,852
"Then why are you upset?
What are you disturbed about?"

528
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:49,060
"Have you lost something?"

529
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:52,531
"I have found someone..."

530
00:58:53,497 --> 00:58:56,330
"Who is this disguised
as a cloud?"

531
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,660
"Who has come and taken
over my heart?"

532
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:06,305
"I would like to say it
but I can't name it."

533
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:10,343
"Don't name it but say
something."

534
00:59:11,013 --> 00:59:13,881
"Give us a slight clue."

535
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:17,642
"Lt's in my eyes
lt's in my heart"

536
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,618
"What can I tell you friends..."

537
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:24,151
"I've found someone..."

538
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:48,845
"I don't know what's happened to me"

539
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,178
"Why am I so lost"

540
00:59:53,589 --> 00:59:59,459
"Either I was insane earlier
or I've become so now"

541
01:00:00,731 --> 01:00:03,461
"Dreamy eyes and unkempt hair"

542
01:00:04,001 --> 01:00:06,798
"What have you done
to yourself"

543
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:10,370
"I've found someone..."

544
01:00:10,874 --> 01:00:13,966
"I've lost my heart..."

545
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:17,475
"What can I tell you my friends..."

546
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:21,082
"I'm all shook up..."

547
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:23,644
"I've found someone..."

548
01:01:36,727 --> 01:01:39,626
Anjali, what's wrong?

549
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:44,725
Don't know why, I am
missing mom today.

550
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:48,401
How can you say this when
I am here for you?

551
01:01:54,745 --> 01:01:57,042
Stupid, tears don't
solve anything.

552
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:30,278
Anjali how long have
you known Rahul?

553
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:32,782
From the first day at college.

554
01:02:32,783 --> 01:02:35,217
You know what I did?
I defeated him in arm wrestling.

555
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:38,242
Eversince we've been
best friends.

556
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:42,224
Rahul is your best friend,
isn't it?

557
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:44,557
I am Rahul's best friend.

558
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:53,234
Aren't you in love with him?

559
01:02:58,374 --> 01:03:00,568
Hi! Shall I go?
- Where?

560
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:06,181
Today's Tuesday...

561
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:09,673
Rahul goes to meet his
relatives every Tuesday.

562
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:12,121
But l'll stay if you want.

563
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:14,123
No, you go Rahul. You'll get late.
- I have some time.

564
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:17,992
No Rahul you'll be late,
go, go, bye!

565
01:03:34,678 --> 01:03:37,010
God please see that I don't fail
in my exams this time as well

566
01:03:37,546 --> 01:03:40,776
I am a bit weak in Chemistry.
So, you take care of it.

567
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,888
Hey! Look forward.

568
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:10,112
So, your relatives
stay here?

569
01:04:10,113 --> 01:04:12,910
Yes, here... here... here...

570
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:18,245
So, Rahul Khanna comes
to the temple every Tuesday.

571
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:22,589
Yes.
- How sweet.

572
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,594
Why did you lie at college then?

573
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:28,428
Actually boys don't go to
the temple. So!

574
01:04:29,231 --> 01:04:31,266
But you do...
- Yes.

575
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:33,335
You come every week?
- Yes.

576
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:36,070
How sweet...
- Don't call me sweet.

577
01:04:36,071 --> 01:04:38,273
Actually my dad used
to say that...

578
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:40,608
...don't tell this to
anyone at college.

579
01:04:40,609 --> 01:04:42,839
He says that a Man should
bow to 3 women...

580
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:48,077
...to mom-to one's mother,
to the Goddess Durga... and...

581
01:04:49,785 --> 01:04:52,687
And?
- And...

582
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:10,702
Wear it. What do they say,
cool, you'll look cool.

583
01:05:11,675 --> 01:05:13,939
I was just trying. Don't
know, how they wear all this.

584
01:05:14,843 --> 01:05:17,642
There's nothing wrong in looking
girlish once in a while.

585
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:21,841
Here, your mother's letter.
You were missing her, weren't you?

586
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:25,920
And listen, take this too.
- What is this?

587
01:05:25,921 --> 01:05:28,149
Present.

588
01:05:40,736 --> 01:05:42,896
Hey Tina.

589
01:05:45,809 --> 01:05:47,442
Rahul... what are you doing
here at this hour?

590
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,707
Actually I couldn't sleep and I
thought even you won't be asleep...

591
01:05:50,213 --> 01:05:52,374
...and would be thinking of
me, so I came...

592
01:05:53,414 --> 01:05:55,951
Do you like flowers or chocolates?
- What?

593
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:59,180
I haven't got either,
I was just curious...

594
01:06:04,193 --> 01:06:06,990
Got chocolates too...

595
01:06:08,597 --> 01:06:10,896
...don't you think
it's too hot out here?

596
01:06:16,006 --> 01:06:19,472
Okay! Lf you insist.

597
01:06:25,515 --> 01:06:28,914
Hey sit down... feel at home.

598
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:39,461
Isn't this the novel where the
butler murders the married couple?

599
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:44,796
Why are you wasting yourtime
reading such a thick book, ask me!

600
01:06:45,834 --> 01:06:48,167
Rahul, you didn't finish
your story.

601
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:51,868
This couple goes on a holiday and
leave their butler behind...

602
01:06:52,374 --> 01:06:54,376
Later one finds out the
butler is...

603
01:06:54,377 --> 01:06:56,244
Not this story...
- Then?

604
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:58,280
The one you were telling me
at the temple

605
01:06:58,281 --> 01:07:01,305
Which temple? I don't know
any temple.

606
01:07:03,086 --> 01:07:06,952
The story about a man bowing to
three women...

607
01:07:07,691 --> 01:07:10,955
...one's mother, the goddess
Durga, and...

608
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:14,457
- And?
- And...

609
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:20,034
Papa?
- Groucho...

610
01:07:20,035 --> 01:07:22,103
Shut up. Rahul, papa's coming...

611
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:24,373
Congratulations.
- Shut up Rahul, go from here.

612
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:27,104
No... not from there,
go from there.

613
01:07:47,097 --> 01:07:49,086
Rahul!

614
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:54,660
And.

615
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:17,019
L'll climb this ladder
and catch the culprit

616
01:08:18,061 --> 01:08:19,528
What is it?
- Torch.

617
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:22,324
Throw it.
- Okay.

618
01:08:22,332 --> 01:08:24,332
Groucho...

619
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:27,266
Who hit me?

620
01:08:29,239 --> 01:08:32,003
A ghost! L'll become a ghost as well.
The ghost will also get scared of me.

621
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:36,467
Where has the ladder gone?

622
01:08:41,449 --> 01:08:43,677
Malhotra!

623
01:08:43,753 --> 01:08:46,186
Why are you sneaking into
your own house?

624
01:08:56,766 --> 01:08:59,301
Rahul, what are you doing?
- I was on my way to see you.

625
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:01,234
Me? Why?

626
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:03,505
Hey look, a shooting star.

627
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:05,936
Where?
- Not down here, up there!

628
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:09,672
They say if you make a wish on a
shooting star, yourwish comes true.

629
01:09:10,547 --> 01:09:14,346
You believe that?
- Let's try. Come on.

630
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:27,248
"You came close to me"

631
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:32,387
"Smiled ever so sweetly."

632
01:10:39,903 --> 01:10:44,565
"You gave me dreams."

633
01:10:55,851 --> 01:11:00,050
"These days my heart is neither
awake nor asleep"

634
01:11:00,957 --> 01:11:05,154
"What should I do?
Somethings happen in my heart."

635
01:11:58,448 --> 01:12:02,382
"Oh! What a feeling this is!"

636
01:12:03,252 --> 01:12:07,712
"What is this unquenchable thirst?"

637
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:15,689
"I know not, this drunken stupor
of love that's consuming me?"

638
01:12:16,864 --> 01:12:21,427
"No one knows, why one loses
one's peace, when in love"

639
01:12:22,305 --> 01:12:26,537
"What should I do?
Somethings happen in my heart."

640
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:13,177
"My prayers have been answered"

641
01:13:13,823 --> 01:13:17,882
"God knows when and how
I fell in love."

642
01:13:19,427 --> 01:13:26,301
"I wonder how,
I found peace in turmoil."

643
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:31,832
"I sit alone, weaving memories."

644
01:13:32,809 --> 01:13:37,141
"What should I do?
Somethings happen in my heart..."

645
01:14:40,743 --> 01:14:43,345
Butler's the killer...
Butler's the killer...

646
01:14:43,346 --> 01:14:45,677
Hey! Look at that.

647
01:14:54,489 --> 01:14:57,083
Hi guys! How do I look?

648
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:03,555
Just like Tina, right?

649
01:15:55,351 --> 01:15:57,476
Here? Okay.

650
01:16:02,091 --> 01:16:04,649
I'm mad, aren't I?

651
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:07,226
I wanted to look beautiful
like you...

652
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:12,021
...but I don't even know
how to.

653
01:16:13,002 --> 01:16:15,195
You are beautiful, Anjali.

654
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:18,907
You're lying.

655
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:20,908
Didn't you hearthem
laughing?

656
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:24,037
Those people are...
...idiots like me.

657
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:27,373
Actually you're the most beautiful,
because you're very special.

658
01:16:29,284 --> 01:16:31,650
Atleast you're not like those
girls, I keep running after.

659
01:16:34,257 --> 01:16:37,658
You know, you can have
any boy you want.

660
01:16:38,961 --> 01:16:42,395
Anyone?
- Anyone.

661
01:16:42,396 --> 01:16:45,458
Anyone?
- Anyone.

662
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:50,002
But he has to be cockeyed.

663
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:56,002
Where did you get this
lipstick?

664
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:04,047
L'll bash her nicely.

665
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:23,668
Love is strange,
love is weird.

666
01:17:25,306 --> 01:17:30,712
It's unaware of happiness
and pain.

667
01:17:31,314 --> 01:17:32,979
Papa

668
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:34,983
Rahul.
- Papa?

669
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:36,649
What papa?

670
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:38,711
You can't keep secrets from me.

671
01:17:40,623 --> 01:17:42,716
But Rahul? Couldn't
you find anyone else?

672
01:17:43,426 --> 01:17:45,984
Come on papa.

673
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:48,462
Actually, I would have felt
as bad...

674
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:52,265
...even if it were someone else.

675
01:17:52,266 --> 01:17:54,301
Why?

676
01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:57,270
Because l'll have to share
your love with him.

677
01:18:00,775 --> 01:18:02,944
I love you papa.

678
01:18:02,945 --> 01:18:06,105
That is the problem.
I love you too.

679
01:18:06,949 --> 01:18:09,315
Have you told him as yet?

680
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:23,659
I just feel that Rahul
and Anjali...

681
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:27,658
Tina, Rahul only loves you...

682
01:18:29,436 --> 01:18:32,168
...and Anjali is his best
friend, nothing else.

683
01:18:33,609 --> 01:18:35,710
No papa.

684
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:39,645
Somewhere hidden in this
deep friendship is deep love...

685
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:45,284
...and I don't want to come
in the way of this love.

686
01:18:46,355 --> 01:18:48,354
The whole college knows that...

687
01:18:48,355 --> 01:18:51,587
...Rahul and Anjali are just
friends and nothing else.

688
01:18:53,262 --> 01:18:56,425
Go tell him that you love him.

689
01:18:57,498 --> 01:19:01,195
But I don't even know,
if he loves me.

690
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:06,172
Don't keep matters of the heart
a secret. Go and tell him.

691
01:19:26,328 --> 01:19:28,690
I love you.

692
01:19:30,466 --> 01:19:33,024
I really love you.

693
01:19:38,007 --> 01:19:41,109
I neverthought I'd say
this to someone...

694
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:43,168
...but I really love you.

695
01:19:50,186 --> 01:19:52,453
I hope I can get myself
to say this to her...

696
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:54,717
I wanted to say it to her
so often...

697
01:19:55,324 --> 01:19:57,926
...but couldn't get the
courage...

698
01:19:57,927 --> 01:20:03,159
...and whenever I meet her
I decide to, but... somehow...

699
01:20:04,164 --> 01:20:06,462
Tell whom?
- Tina. Who else?

700
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:10,936
Let's do this again.
L'll be Rahul you be Tina.

701
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:29,113
I love you.

702
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:36,525
I love you too.

703
01:20:38,766 --> 01:20:41,962
She'll say the same thing,
won't she?

704
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:47,003
Ya.
- Come here.

705
01:20:51,445 --> 01:20:54,175
Shall I tell her?

706
01:20:55,784 --> 01:20:57,943
Shall I go right now?

707
01:21:09,463 --> 01:21:13,958
"O! My Lord, love comes with
so much pain"

708
01:21:33,355 --> 01:21:39,087
"The heartfelt remains in
the heart..."

709
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:50,203
"and does not escape from
one's lips"

710
01:22:22,738 --> 01:22:27,471
My first love is incomplete Rifat bi.
My first love is incomplete.

711
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:47,315
I love you.

712
01:22:47,663 --> 01:22:52,190
"You did not remember me,
there's nothing more left to say"

713
01:23:02,845 --> 01:23:08,373
"The heart cried and the eyes welled up
There's nothing more left to say"

714
01:23:09,217 --> 01:23:13,712
"You did not remember me
there's nothing more left to say"

715
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:30,136
"The heart cried and the eyes welled up
There's nothing more left to say"

716
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:45,079
Mother!

717
01:23:56,530 --> 01:24:00,967
"I gave you all my joys,
gave you all my smiles"

718
01:24:07,976 --> 01:24:13,105
"Your locks enticed me, bidding
messages of faithfulness"

719
01:24:17,519 --> 01:24:22,582
"You couldn't care for my love.
There is nothing more left to say"

720
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:25,552
"You did not remember me
there's nothing more left to say"

721
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:41,202
Anjali... Anjali.

722
01:24:41,877 --> 01:24:44,141
Rahul you look ahead,
l'll look there.

723
01:24:45,346 --> 01:24:47,542
Anjali... Anjali...

724
01:24:54,489 --> 01:24:56,717
One minute.

725
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:58,591
Where are you off to?

726
01:24:58,592 --> 01:25:00,461
Home.
- What?

727
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:03,659
I got a letter from mom.
My father's not well...

728
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:06,466
...and there is lots of work
in the new house.

729
01:25:06,467 --> 01:25:08,703
Have you gone mad? You got
a letter and you're leaving?

730
01:25:08,704 --> 01:25:11,439
You're not going anywhere.
- Rahul, I have to go.

731
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,439
How can you go in the middle
of the term?

732
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:16,109
Rahul please...
- Go afterthis semester.

733
01:25:16,110 --> 01:25:19,569
Rahul I have to go.
- You can go afterthe final exams.

734
01:25:20,347 --> 01:25:23,578
Rahul I might not come back
even forthe final exams.

735
01:25:28,323 --> 01:25:30,981
I'm not coming back Rahul.

736
01:25:33,494 --> 01:25:37,190
You are leaving college,
leaving me...

737
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:44,101
...and you didn't even tell
me about it.

738
01:25:47,007 --> 01:25:50,011
Rahul please...
- I don't want to know.

739
01:25:50,012 --> 01:25:52,842
Rahul I'm going.
- So go.

740
01:25:54,748 --> 01:25:57,979
Rahul I'm not coming back.
- I don't care.

741
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:00,739
Anjali don't go.
Who'll I play basketball with?

742
01:27:01,414 --> 01:27:03,417
You used to lose everyday, anyways.

743
01:27:03,418 --> 01:27:05,417
But why are you going?

744
01:27:05,418 --> 01:27:07,752
My parents need me...
- And I don't?

745
01:27:09,422 --> 01:27:11,481
Now you irritate Tina. You've
bothered me enough.

746
01:27:12,461 --> 01:27:14,729
L'll fail.
- Then fail.

747
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:16,197
Anjali...

748
01:27:16,198 --> 01:27:19,427
Stop chasing those stupid
girls now.

749
01:27:26,909 --> 01:27:30,275
L'll miss you Anjali.
- L'll miss you too.

750
01:28:08,481 --> 01:28:11,110
That day I realised that
perhaps...

751
01:28:11,787 --> 01:28:14,622
...I had come between
Rahul and Anjali.

752
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:16,887
Perhaps, I had come between
two friends...

753
01:28:18,994 --> 01:28:21,222
Anjali's silence told me
everything.

754
01:28:22,195 --> 01:28:25,596
And that day I was sure...
...that she loved your father.

755
01:28:26,668 --> 01:28:29,136
Perhaps even I couldn't
love him as much.

756
01:28:30,439 --> 01:28:32,498
Anjali neither called norwrote.

757
01:28:33,976 --> 01:28:37,342
She had gone away from
our lives. Forever.

758
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:47,382
Yes. I became his friend but
could never be his best friend.

759
01:28:49,658 --> 01:28:54,391
Your father is alone now
but won't say anything.

760
01:28:56,096 --> 01:28:59,226
He needs a friend, he needs
love...

761
01:28:59,868 --> 01:29:02,199
that friend is Anjali,
that love is Anjali.

762
01:29:04,940 --> 01:29:07,238
Get Anjali back into
your father's life.

763
01:29:09,878 --> 01:29:13,105
Return Anjali her first love.

764
01:29:13,547 --> 01:29:16,775
Anjali and Rahul are made
for each other.

765
01:29:17,552 --> 01:29:21,043
This is the truth and
this is my dream.

766
01:29:29,596 --> 01:29:32,827
Will you fulfil your mother's dream?

767
01:29:34,069 --> 01:29:37,171
Get Anjali back in Rahul's life.

768
01:29:37,172 --> 01:29:39,436
Get Anjali back in your
father's life.

769
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:43,699
Make my dream come true.

770
01:30:09,235 --> 01:30:12,136
Happy Birthday!
Give me five.

771
01:30:39,333 --> 01:30:42,302
This is Malhotra speaking,
using STD on my personal line.

772
01:30:43,238 --> 01:30:45,139
Are you all coming tomorrow?

773
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:48,940
Yes! As soon as we reach Delhi,
we'll take the Faridabad train.

774
01:30:49,578 --> 01:30:53,412
The one at 4 O'clock?
- Yes! What are you doing?

775
01:30:54,414 --> 01:30:57,748
Me? I was just... nothing.

776
01:30:58,284 --> 01:30:59,886
No... sorry not you.

777
01:30:59,887 --> 01:31:01,520
These Mumbai butlers
are something else.

778
01:31:01,521 --> 01:31:04,820
Okay then, l'll pick you
up tomorrow.

779
01:31:05,525 --> 01:31:08,289
Sure? You forgot last time.

780
01:31:08,962 --> 01:31:11,021
Last time... this time
l'll be there

781
01:31:11,699 --> 01:31:14,234
...by the way, the requirements
forthe death anniversary...

782
01:31:14,235 --> 01:31:16,668
Yes! I am getting it all
with me. Don't worry.

783
01:31:17,270 --> 01:31:20,101
Okay then, bye.
- Bye.

784
01:31:25,913 --> 01:31:26,912
Hi Guys!

785
01:31:26,913 --> 01:31:30,145
This is Neelam and you're watching
your favourite show, The Neelam Show.

786
01:31:30,851 --> 01:31:33,051
Like always we are going to
do something new...

787
01:31:33,052 --> 01:31:35,189
We are going to play a game.

788
01:31:35,190 --> 01:31:38,623
Would you all like to play
this game?

789
01:31:39,961 --> 01:31:43,453
Lt is said that this game gets
matters of the heart to the fore.

790
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:47,966
I will say a word...

791
01:31:47,967 --> 01:31:51,336
...and you have to say the first
word that comes to your mind.

792
01:31:52,073 --> 01:31:55,132
But you get no time
to think.

793
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:00,814
We'll start with you, Clouds?

794
01:32:00,815 --> 01:32:03,317
Sorry. Times up. Clouds?

795
01:32:03,318 --> 01:32:05,373
Rain.

796
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:07,621
Beautiful?
- Neelam.

797
01:32:07,622 --> 01:32:09,850
Thanks!

798
01:32:10,158 --> 01:32:11,890
Heart?
- Love.

799
01:32:11,891 --> 01:32:14,194
Okay... Love?
- Seema.

800
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:17,186
What? You love me?
- Yeah!

801
01:32:17,864 --> 01:32:20,835
This game really works.

802
01:32:20,836 --> 01:32:23,997
You saw how real feelings came
rushing out. Now you try this game...

803
01:32:25,038 --> 01:32:27,971
...and we'll be back
after a break.

804
01:32:30,311 --> 01:32:33,042
Stupid game, stupid Neelam.
- Don't call my Neelam stupid.

805
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:38,713
Okay! Let's play your game.

806
01:32:39,354 --> 01:32:44,722
Okay! Ready, start, go... Sexy?
- Granny.

807
01:32:46,261 --> 01:32:48,429
Papa play seriously.
- Okay.

808
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:50,658
Clouds?

809
01:32:50,699 --> 01:32:52,166
Papa you can't take so long.

810
01:32:52,167 --> 01:32:55,967
I'm having water. Okay, now
we'll start. Tell me.

811
01:32:56,805 --> 01:32:58,136
Clouds?
- Air.

812
01:32:58,137 --> 01:32:59,471
Mad?
- You.

813
01:32:59,472 --> 01:33:00,506
Home?
- Us.

814
01:33:00,507 --> 01:33:02,009
Love?
- Friendship.

815
01:33:02,010 --> 01:33:04,278
Anjali?
- Sharma.

816
01:33:04,279 --> 01:33:06,507
Sharma?

817
01:33:07,146 --> 01:33:09,614
Who is Anjali Sharma?

818
01:33:12,186 --> 01:33:13,886
Who is she?

819
01:33:13,887 --> 01:33:15,587
Nobody.

820
01:33:15,588 --> 01:33:17,658
Papa, it's my birthday...

821
01:33:17,659 --> 01:33:20,958
Okay. Anjali Sharma studied
in college with me.

822
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:25,293
In your College?

823
01:33:27,002 --> 01:33:30,230
She was my friend.
- Friend!

824
01:33:30,238 --> 01:33:31,805
My best friend.

825
01:33:31,806 --> 01:33:35,204
Her name's very nice,
what was she like?

826
01:33:39,145 --> 01:33:42,274
She was unlike any other girl.

827
01:33:42,382 --> 01:33:45,945
She was like one of the boys.

828
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:52,391
All the other girls spent
time on make up...

829
01:33:55,096 --> 01:33:57,394
...but Anjali played
Basketball.

830
01:34:01,136 --> 01:34:04,367
She wore clothes like me.
Yeah! Really.

831
01:34:08,275 --> 01:34:14,270
Anjali was mad. Dressing
up and looking beautiful...

832
01:34:14,949 --> 01:34:18,177
...was just not her scene.

833
01:34:20,954 --> 01:34:23,890
Enough or do you still
want to hear more?

834
01:34:23,891 --> 01:34:27,020
Papa where is she now?
- I don't know.

835
01:34:35,235 --> 01:34:37,966
Anjali, I can't believe that
you are getting engaged.

836
01:34:40,873 --> 01:34:43,239
By the way, Guruji has come
to fix the wedding date.

837
01:34:45,945 --> 01:34:48,282
Show me that one.

838
01:34:48,283 --> 01:34:50,713
How much will you adorn yourself,
Aman's getting impatient.

839
01:35:00,061 --> 01:35:03,622
"Your groom has been
waiting for long"

840
01:35:04,899 --> 01:35:08,494
"Don't delay anymore
come soon"

841
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:33,484
"I've come to your doorstep
I've come to take you away"

842
01:35:34,128 --> 01:35:38,587
"I've come to exchange
my heart for yours"

843
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:53,413
"My every heartbeat has a message
for you... listen to my heart"

844
01:35:54,181 --> 01:35:58,378
"The Bridegroom has come home..."

845
01:35:59,087 --> 01:36:00,988
"Why's the bride shy?"

846
01:36:00,989 --> 01:36:04,320
"The Bridegroom has come home"

847
01:36:13,435 --> 01:36:17,769
"Oh! Dear heart you can't make
excuses... no more"

848
01:36:18,538 --> 01:36:22,601
"Now the bride will have
to go with her groom"

849
01:36:23,342 --> 01:36:27,802
"What's her vermilion
whispering to her?"

850
01:37:14,128 --> 01:37:18,530
"I've got hooked in
his net of love"

851
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:21,600
"Dear friends, how
did this happen?"

852
01:37:21,601 --> 01:37:23,970
"Tell me, tell me"

853
01:37:23,971 --> 01:37:28,341
"Oh my darling! Your friends
too have a crush on me"

854
01:37:29,144 --> 01:37:31,873
"They won't have much to say
Ask them"

855
01:37:34,149 --> 01:37:37,878
"Go, go, dear liar
Why do you make self praises"

856
01:37:43,856 --> 01:37:48,123
"Your love has something to say
Will you listen to my heart!"

857
01:38:37,543 --> 01:38:41,503
" He is innocent and oblivious. I've
done him a favour by accepting him. "

858
01:38:42,217 --> 01:38:44,945
" Someone please convey to him. "

859
01:38:46,988 --> 01:38:53,484
" She teases me deliberately I've given
my heart in return of her favour "

860
01:38:54,262 --> 01:38:57,264
"Do convey to her"

861
01:38:57,265 --> 01:39:00,699
"You're not aware of heartbreak"

862
01:39:06,908 --> 01:39:11,070
"Your love has something to say
Will you listen to his heart"

863
01:39:50,650 --> 01:39:54,815
"With henna on your hands
bedecked with jewellery"

864
01:40:00,261 --> 01:40:05,221
"Teary eyed you will make us all,
and leave in the morning"

865
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:09,927
"We will miss you lots,
We will miss you lots"

866
01:40:54,914 --> 01:40:58,943
"I've come to your doorstep
I've come to take you away"

867
01:40:59,787 --> 01:41:03,552
"I've come to exchange
my heart for yours"

868
01:41:04,425 --> 01:41:08,793
"My every heartbeat has a message
for you... listen to my heart"

869
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:12,623
"The Bridegroom has come home"

870
01:41:14,369 --> 01:41:17,699
"Why's the bride shy?"

871
01:42:05,086 --> 01:42:07,712
This is the old address.
Where do I get the new one from?

872
01:42:08,422 --> 01:42:10,424
What Grandpa, you can't even
do this much for me?

873
01:42:10,425 --> 01:42:12,757
I can do it for you but...
- Really!

874
01:42:13,461 --> 01:42:16,394
The college principal can't even
do this much.

875
01:42:18,632 --> 01:42:25,538
One minute... She would definitely
know where Anjali Sharma is.

876
01:42:35,414 --> 01:42:38,815
I'm sorry. I had promised
Anjali that...

877
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:41,586
...I would not give her
address to anyone.

878
01:42:41,587 --> 01:42:43,890
We were hopeful that...

879
01:42:43,891 --> 01:42:47,622
I understand sir, but I made
a promise to Anjali.

880
01:42:48,628 --> 01:42:53,498
Rifat bi, I'm also Anjali,
you won't tell me either?

881
01:42:58,439 --> 01:43:00,770
Sir, she's getting engaged
today...

882
01:43:01,574 --> 01:43:03,877
...and herwedding is within
this week.

883
01:43:03,878 --> 01:43:06,811
Her Guruji will finalise
the date today.

884
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:09,483
The preparations forthe
wedding are underway.

885
01:43:09,484 --> 01:43:12,449
You have come very late.

886
01:43:12,485 --> 01:43:15,217
I am also going by
tomorrow afternoon's train.

887
01:43:15,922 --> 01:43:19,221
This marriage cannot happen.
Mummy said so.

888
01:43:23,864 --> 01:43:26,230
Guruji, we need to finalise
the wedding date.

889
01:43:27,001 --> 01:43:28,969
Yes dear.

890
01:43:28,970 --> 01:43:31,699
This is Aman's horoscope.
- Yes.

891
01:43:32,471 --> 01:43:35,306
Aman wants to go to
London this month.

892
01:43:36,644 --> 01:43:38,735
If you could find a date this
month itself?

893
01:43:40,047 --> 01:43:41,980
This month?
- Yes Guruji.

894
01:43:41,981 --> 01:43:44,382
Sir, if you would have
come earlier...

895
01:43:44,985 --> 01:43:48,213
Yes, but we didn't know...

896
01:44:12,613 --> 01:44:15,081
Anjali's stars have a negative
influence right now.

897
01:44:15,082 --> 01:44:17,550
Until it changes she
cannot get married.

898
01:44:24,559 --> 01:44:27,528
What about next month Guruji?
- Not even next month.

899
01:44:34,333 --> 01:44:37,824
Not before December.

900
01:45:02,494 --> 01:45:04,824
I had heard of God's grace,
today I've seen it.

901
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:10,502
The child's prayers
have been answered

902
01:45:10,503 --> 01:45:13,801
Anjali's wedding is
postponed to December.

903
01:45:17,610 --> 01:45:22,345
Anjali, can I ask you something?
- Yes.

904
01:45:24,752 --> 01:45:27,650
Are you happy?

905
01:45:32,391 --> 01:45:34,690
What sort of a question is that?
Of course I'm happy.

906
01:45:36,663 --> 01:45:39,399
I've got engaged.

907
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:45,065
Aman's really nice, he
loves me a lot and...

908
01:45:45,573 --> 01:45:48,266
But do you love him?

909
01:45:52,945 --> 01:45:55,175
Anjali...

910
01:46:00,253 --> 01:46:03,221
I have already loved mom.

911
01:46:07,128 --> 01:46:10,355
I'm not sure I can do
it again.

912
01:46:14,168 --> 01:46:16,100
Just think of this
as a compromise.

913
01:46:16,101 --> 01:46:18,262
Compromise?

914
01:46:20,105 --> 01:46:25,101
I neverthought that my daughterwould
marry out of compromise and not love

915
01:46:27,780 --> 01:46:32,617
I'm your mother and I want
you to be happy too.

916
01:46:34,954 --> 01:46:40,914
But a home based on a compromise
is a house, not a home.

917
01:46:47,199 --> 01:46:49,927
The rest is upto you.

918
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:34,471
Oh! I can't handle this
religious stuff... Yes I can.

919
01:47:37,016 --> 01:47:39,212
Today Guruji is going to chant
hymns and read the sacred book.

920
01:47:39,686 --> 01:47:42,485
Wow! How exciting. This
Guruji will get a...

921
01:47:43,757 --> 01:47:46,985
Why? He has delayed my wedding.

922
01:47:47,793 --> 01:47:49,863
I can't stand these hymns any more.

923
01:47:49,864 --> 01:47:52,296
Even God gets fed up with
so many hymns.

924
01:47:52,297 --> 01:47:54,734
Why? Don't you want to ask
God for anything special?

925
01:47:54,735 --> 01:47:57,036
I've got you...
what more could I ask for?

926
01:47:57,037 --> 01:48:02,498
Well I do want some kids but that
I'm afraid l'll have to do myself.

927
01:48:03,010 --> 01:48:05,238
Behave yourself!

928
01:48:09,650 --> 01:48:13,641
Aman I saw you bare bodied,
exercising this morning.

929
01:48:14,454 --> 01:48:18,253
What are you saying?
- Kammo... even in your old age?

930
01:48:18,824 --> 01:48:21,123
Old! Old must be you.

931
01:48:22,096 --> 01:48:27,762
Don't trouble him.
Do you have a brother?

932
01:48:29,203 --> 01:48:31,501
My Gurpreet is also very pretty.
- What are you saying?

933
01:48:33,338 --> 01:48:37,333
Forget Gurpreet,
My Jaspreet is Ms. Chandigarh.

934
01:48:38,811 --> 01:48:41,543
Ms. Chandigarh or Ms. Sector 11.

935
01:48:44,185 --> 01:48:47,019
Okay come on now, Guruji
has started.

936
01:48:47,020 --> 01:48:50,043
Okay, bye Aman.

937
01:48:52,159 --> 01:48:54,351
Anjali, there is a call for you.

938
01:48:55,762 --> 01:48:58,391
Thanks a lot mother-in-law.
- Welcome son-in-law.

939
01:49:05,771 --> 01:49:09,207
Hello!
I love you.

940
01:49:09,708 --> 01:49:12,940
Huh... Aman!
- Listen, I have a problem.

941
01:49:14,713 --> 01:49:17,181
What?
- Don't leave me like this.

942
01:49:17,885 --> 01:49:20,854
Aman I don't know who is
on the line.

943
01:49:20,855 --> 01:49:22,913
And anyway you are going to
Shimla for your summer camp.

944
01:49:24,725 --> 01:49:26,725
You're going to Bombay as well.

945
01:49:26,726 --> 01:49:29,761
For24 hours and you're
going for a month.

946
01:49:29,762 --> 01:49:33,288
Aman, I go there every year
to teach singing and dancing.

947
01:49:34,199 --> 01:49:36,293
Those kids are part of my life.

948
01:49:37,936 --> 01:49:40,605
Even they are a part of
your life.

949
01:49:40,606 --> 01:49:43,439
Only I'm left out.

950
01:49:47,681 --> 01:49:50,550
Why do I get the feeling, you
don't love me?

951
01:49:50,551 --> 01:49:52,283
Because I don't.

952
01:49:52,284 --> 01:49:55,619
And that you don't want to marry me.
- Right, I don't.

953
01:49:56,556 --> 01:50:00,220
Hey! Any tantrums this time...

954
01:50:00,927 --> 01:50:03,796
...and l'll drag you by the
hand to the marriage pandal.

955
01:50:03,797 --> 01:50:06,628
You'll force me?
- If need be.

956
01:50:09,034 --> 01:50:11,967
You have the guts to do it?

957
01:50:12,204 --> 01:50:14,672
Try me.

958
01:50:16,010 --> 01:50:18,310
L'll stay here with
your aunts.

959
01:50:18,311 --> 01:50:20,747
You go to Shimla
for your Summer Camp

960
01:50:20,748 --> 01:50:22,976
Summer Camp!

961
01:50:24,051 --> 01:50:25,385
Shimla!

962
01:50:25,386 --> 01:50:28,877
Summer Camp? Shimla?

963
01:50:29,757 --> 01:50:32,385
No way. Too much snow there.

964
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:36,927
Papa, it's a summer camp.
- Whatever... ls this okay?

965
01:50:37,896 --> 01:50:40,195
Yes. Papa they teach singing
and dancing there...

966
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:43,266
...and you know I am fond
of that.

967
01:50:43,971 --> 01:50:45,939
Since when have you been fond
of singing and dancing?

968
01:50:45,940 --> 01:50:48,608
I've said no means no.

969
01:50:48,609 --> 01:50:51,735
Papa not fair.
- Let her go.

970
01:50:52,546 --> 01:50:55,945
All kids go to camps. She'll also...
- Mom! L'll handle this okay.

971
01:50:57,382 --> 01:51:00,284
But Rahul try and understand.
L'll also go with her...

972
01:51:01,355 --> 01:51:03,756
Papa I want to go, I want
to go, please papa.

973
01:51:03,757 --> 01:51:05,985
No Anjali.

974
01:51:07,394 --> 01:51:14,391
Shut up. I said no. Now
neither of you will go.

975
01:51:36,457 --> 01:51:40,324
You felt bad? I'm sorry.

976
01:51:43,663 --> 01:51:46,153
It's okay.

977
01:51:48,034 --> 01:51:51,262
This doesn't mean you're going.

978
01:51:51,270 --> 01:51:54,399
I'm going to the conference.
We'll talk when I get back.

979
01:51:55,542 --> 01:51:58,277
Papa.
- Now what?

980
01:51:58,278 --> 01:52:01,109
You haven't worn your pants.

981
01:52:04,184 --> 01:52:06,744
It's okay, you wear it
if you want to.

982
01:52:24,171 --> 01:52:27,400
Drivertake out the pant...
the car.

983
01:52:30,177 --> 01:52:34,443
Anjali... How will we make
your father come to the camp?

984
01:52:35,181 --> 01:52:42,712
Oh Granny! Rememberwhen dad was
in London and I fell sick.

985
01:52:43,355 --> 01:52:44,689
Yes my baby.

986
01:52:44,690 --> 01:52:47,659
Granny. Papa left everything
and came back immediately.

987
01:53:01,809 --> 01:53:04,801
- Oops sorry !
- Don't worry about it man, it's okay.

988
01:53:10,016 --> 01:53:11,818
Indian Exporters Conference,
good evening!

989
01:53:11,819 --> 01:53:13,920
May I speak to Aman Mehra please?

990
01:53:13,921 --> 01:53:17,320
Whom shall I say is calling?
- Anjali.

991
01:53:20,394 --> 01:53:22,426
Indian Exporters Conference,
good evening!

992
01:53:22,427 --> 01:53:25,465
Hello! Can I speak to papa?
- Papa?

993
01:53:25,466 --> 01:53:28,167
Your father's not a film star.
Tell her his name.

994
01:53:28,168 --> 01:53:30,931
Sorry. May I speak to
Mr. Rahul Khanna please?

995
01:53:31,605 --> 01:53:34,238
Whom shall I say is calling?
- Anjali

996
01:53:34,239 --> 01:53:36,467
Certainly, Anjali.

997
01:53:38,579 --> 01:53:41,806
Quickly tell him we're going
and put the phone down.

998
01:53:46,253 --> 01:53:49,150
Hi! Rahul Khanna.

999
01:54:01,635 --> 01:54:04,797
Hello! Aman, I can't hear you.
- I can hear you. Tell me?

1000
01:54:05,570 --> 01:54:09,132
Hi sweetheart!
I'm really missing you.

1001
01:54:12,677 --> 01:54:14,873
Listen, I'm off to the camp tomorrow.

1002
01:54:15,681 --> 01:54:17,817
- Where to ?
- Summer camp.

1003
01:54:17,818 --> 01:54:20,878
Again summer camp. I said
no once to you, didn't I ?

1004
01:54:21,654 --> 01:54:26,387
Listen. I'm feeling very...
give me a kiss.

1005
01:54:27,461 --> 01:54:30,690
This is your mother speaking.
- Look. I don't like these jokes.

1006
01:54:31,431 --> 01:54:33,198
My mother passed away
10 years ago.

1007
01:54:33,199 --> 01:54:35,632
Why is everyone trying to
pronounce me dead today?

1008
01:54:36,403 --> 01:54:38,462
No summer camp, no summer
camp. Understood ?

1009
01:54:39,105 --> 01:54:40,840
Aman why are you screaming?

1010
01:54:40,841 --> 01:54:43,435
That's because I've told you,
you're not going.

1011
01:54:44,043 --> 01:54:47,605
If you say one more thing,
l'll get home and... slap you.

1012
01:54:48,346 --> 01:54:51,212
Aman you've gone mad.

1013
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:54,819
Anjali?

1014
01:54:54,820 --> 01:54:57,547
Your dad's gone mad.

1015
01:54:58,458 --> 01:55:01,119
Anjali?
- Anjali?

1016
01:55:09,203 --> 01:55:11,368
Hi! I'm Rahul Khanna.
- Aman Mehra, how're you doing?

1017
01:55:11,369 --> 01:55:13,537
I guess because of the same
name she got confused...

1018
01:55:13,538 --> 01:55:16,905
Bet you, my Anjali is
prettierthan yours.

1019
01:55:19,212 --> 01:55:21,212
No! My Anjali is very beautiful.

1020
01:55:21,213 --> 01:55:23,614
I'm sure but not as
beautiful as mine.

1021
01:55:24,551 --> 01:55:26,984
My Anjali is my 8-year-old daughter.

1022
01:55:26,985 --> 01:55:30,284
Shit! You're right.
Your Anjali is prettier.

1023
01:55:36,262 --> 01:55:39,958
Dear Papa, How are you? Sorry
we left without informing you...

1024
01:55:41,368 --> 01:55:43,855
...but you know how much I love
singing and dancing.

1025
01:55:47,774 --> 01:55:50,038
Don't miss me too much.
Love Anjali.

1026
01:55:52,378 --> 01:55:55,403
That's not possible for me to do...

1027
01:55:57,650 --> 01:56:00,208
Good Morning kids.

1028
01:56:01,454 --> 01:56:04,083
I am Col. Almeida, the camp manager.

1029
01:56:04,789 --> 01:56:08,154
L'll now measure your height
and weight.

1030
01:56:08,328 --> 01:56:13,663
24 - very nice, 30 - very good.

1031
01:56:16,270 --> 01:56:18,568
80 - very... what child is this?

1032
01:56:19,940 --> 01:56:22,270
Hey! Who are you?

1033
01:56:23,409 --> 01:56:26,444
Me? I am Granny.
- Whose Granny?

1034
01:56:26,445 --> 01:56:29,282
Anjali's. Who are you?

1035
01:56:29,283 --> 01:56:32,512
Col. Almeida. Camp Manager.

1036
01:56:34,020 --> 01:56:37,512
No grannies', mummies' and
daddies' allowed on this camp.

1037
01:56:38,123 --> 01:56:40,457
So I should've let Anjali
come here alone?

1038
01:56:40,458 --> 01:56:42,426
What?

1039
01:56:42,427 --> 01:56:44,764
Have you seen Ms. Anjali?

1040
01:56:44,765 --> 01:56:46,993
Ms. Anjali!

1041
01:56:47,167 --> 01:56:50,155
What? What?

1042
01:56:56,208 --> 01:57:02,341
The British flag in India...?
L'll sort him out. Almeida...

1043
01:57:07,587 --> 01:57:11,318
You have no shame?
You've hoisted the British flag.

1044
01:57:13,193 --> 01:57:15,225
I love England.

1045
01:57:15,226 --> 01:57:18,355
My fatherwas an English tailor.

1046
01:57:19,364 --> 01:57:22,025
He made this flag.

1047
01:57:22,668 --> 01:57:25,569
Britishers went away and
left you behind.

1048
01:57:25,570 --> 01:57:29,029
You fool, you should teach
the kids "My Bharat is the best".

1049
01:58:18,257 --> 01:58:21,091
Here you go.
- Thank you.

1050
01:58:21,092 --> 01:58:23,153
Hey! What's your name?

1051
01:58:26,297 --> 01:58:30,029
Sorry. What's your name?
- Anjali.

1052
01:58:30,735 --> 01:58:33,568
Hey that's my name too. Hi!

1053
01:58:33,838 --> 01:58:36,806
Why is your name Anjali?

1054
01:58:38,412 --> 01:58:41,141
Perhaps my parents liked
the name.

1055
01:58:42,414 --> 01:58:46,409
Why is your name Anjali?
- Perhaps my parents liked you.

1056
01:58:53,860 --> 01:58:56,655
Where is this Almeida?

1057
01:59:04,404 --> 01:59:06,596
Namaste.

1058
01:59:15,713 --> 01:59:18,079
Almeida...

1059
01:59:21,954 --> 01:59:24,047
I need your blessings mummy.
- Almeida.

1060
01:59:26,324 --> 01:59:29,386
Stop following me.
- Where is the kitchen?

1061
01:59:30,029 --> 01:59:32,698
I want to see how you cook food.

1062
01:59:32,699 --> 01:59:35,895
- And where is the prayer room?
- Puja has not come on duty today.

1063
01:59:36,936 --> 01:59:39,770
Prayer room, where one prays
to the lord.

1064
01:59:40,472 --> 01:59:43,375
We don't do that here.

1065
01:59:43,376 --> 01:59:45,537
What? There is no prayer
to the lord.

1066
01:59:46,913 --> 01:59:49,708
Lord? Who is the Lord?

1067
02:00:00,659 --> 02:00:03,525
Counting stars?

1068
02:00:06,998 --> 02:00:09,556
Counting stars?

1069
02:00:18,645 --> 02:00:20,873
London Bridge is falling
down, falling down... up

1070
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:43,925
Dear God, How are you?

1071
02:00:44,137 --> 02:00:48,403
Please keep papa happy and see that
he doesn't miss me too much.

1072
02:00:49,141 --> 02:00:53,543
You know he can't do anything
without me. Okay.

1073
02:00:54,814 --> 02:00:57,042
Caught you.

1074
02:01:00,887 --> 02:01:03,082
All prayers for papa,
nothing for mama?

1075
02:01:04,556 --> 02:01:07,083
Why ask God for anything for mummy?

1076
02:01:07,561 --> 02:01:10,261
Why?
- She's with him.

1077
02:01:10,262 --> 02:01:12,320
Whatever she wants,
she can ask for it herself.

1078
02:01:23,043 --> 02:01:24,837
Hey! Now go to sleep.
Sweet dreams.

1079
02:01:35,055 --> 02:01:37,283
Miss you papa.

1080
02:01:45,565 --> 02:01:47,832
Hi guys! Welcome to the
Neelam Show...

1081
02:01:47,833 --> 02:01:50,868
...and today we are coming
to you live.

1082
02:01:50,869 --> 02:01:54,738
There's so much noise here,
so check it out...

1083
02:02:09,020 --> 02:02:12,150
Hi Guys! This is Neelam and

02:02:12,626 --> 02:02:13,859

1085
02:02:13,860 --> 02:02:16,693
Like always we're going to do
something new and different.

1086
02:02:17,564 --> 02:02:20,360
Today's theme is love messages.

1087
02:02:23,837 --> 02:02:25,703
Messages anyone?

1088
02:02:25,704 --> 02:02:28,003
I have a message.
- We've got one here.

1089
02:02:29,775 --> 02:02:32,243
Whom is your message for?
- Superna.

1090
02:02:32,244 --> 02:02:35,610
Who is Superna.
- My girlfriend.

1091
02:02:37,784 --> 02:02:39,783
Your message?

1092
02:02:39,784 --> 02:02:43,311
Look Superna. Don't call me.
I've found someone else.

1093
02:02:54,100 --> 02:02:56,793
Hey! Another message.

1094
02:03:02,940 --> 02:03:05,841
I want to give a message too.

1095
02:03:12,217 --> 02:03:15,413
Like the one he gave...
- And his message is for...

1096
02:03:16,056 --> 02:03:18,579
For Anjali.

1097
02:03:20,126 --> 02:03:22,922
I love you Anjali.

1098
02:03:25,565 --> 02:03:28,690
Why have you left me and gone?

1099
02:03:28,802 --> 02:03:32,202
You know I feel lost without you.

1100
02:03:32,837 --> 02:03:36,239
Come back or else... just come back.

1101
02:03:42,146 --> 02:03:44,806
Please come back.

1102
02:03:45,851 --> 02:03:48,876
Who is Anjali?

1103
02:03:50,655 --> 02:03:54,091
She's my 8-year-old daughter.

1104
02:03:54,293 --> 02:03:56,854
She's gone to some camp in Shimla.

1105
02:03:57,895 --> 02:04:01,560
Neelam can you tell herto come
back? She'll listen to you.

1106
02:04:03,636 --> 02:04:06,738
Anjali... Papa really loves you.

1107
02:04:06,739 --> 02:04:09,975
Come back soon. He misses you.

1108
02:04:09,976 --> 02:04:13,204
Come back home. Okay.

1109
02:04:50,917 --> 02:04:53,385
Mr. Khanna, meeting fortomorrow
at 11 a.m. Is confirmed.

1110
02:04:59,025 --> 02:05:02,186
Hi Rahul! Party at my place
tomorrow. See you there.

1111
02:05:03,962 --> 02:05:06,088
Papa... aachoo.
- Cold...?

1112
02:09:59,458 --> 02:10:01,693
Are you feeling okay?

1113
02:10:01,694 --> 02:10:03,662
Yeah. Why?

1114
02:10:03,663 --> 02:10:09,829
No. You're looking... beautiful,
that's why... Saree.

1115
02:10:17,409 --> 02:10:20,400
I didn't know about Tina.
I'm sorry.

1116
02:10:24,748 --> 02:10:26,980
How could you know? You just
disappeared.

1117
02:10:29,154 --> 02:10:31,315
We changed our residence.
- You changed your friends as well?

1118
02:10:34,260 --> 02:10:37,787
When I needed my friend the most,
you were not there.

1119
02:10:43,903 --> 02:10:46,505
You didn't marry again?

1120
02:10:46,506 --> 02:10:48,837
Couldn't find you... or else would
have married you.

1121
02:10:53,412 --> 02:10:59,145
We live once, die once, get
married once and love...

1122
02:10:59,752 --> 02:11:02,114
Only once.

1123
02:11:03,521 --> 02:11:06,387
You didn't get married either?

1124
02:11:06,592 --> 02:11:09,184
Couldn't find you.

1125
02:11:11,631 --> 02:11:16,931
Hey! Look a shooting star.
- Still believe in it?

1126
02:11:18,971 --> 02:11:22,235
No. You?
- No.

1127
02:11:47,766 --> 02:11:50,234
What did you wish for?

1128
02:12:14,226 --> 02:12:16,248
Granny.

1129
02:12:17,529 --> 02:12:20,532
What news?
- Bad news.

1130
02:12:20,533 --> 02:12:22,762
They are behaving like they're
meeting forthe first time.

1131
02:12:23,369 --> 02:12:26,269
Good night Rahul,
Good night Anjali.

1132
02:12:26,270 --> 02:12:29,101
Now what do we do?

1133
02:12:31,877 --> 02:12:34,775
You have any idea granny?

1134
02:12:37,850 --> 02:12:41,114
The solution now lies in
prayer and devotion.

1135
02:12:42,387 --> 02:12:46,846
Oh Granny. Now you only
tell me what to do?

1136
02:13:02,708 --> 02:13:05,277
What are you doing?
Have you gone mad?

1137
02:13:05,278 --> 02:13:08,302
Ls this what I have taught you?

1138
02:13:08,547 --> 02:13:10,782
Big boys don't fight, she's a girl.
- Why are you fighting?

1139
02:13:10,783 --> 02:13:12,283
She hit me first.

1140
02:13:12,284 --> 02:13:15,413
I just said that girls can play
Basketball and he said...

1141
02:13:16,020 --> 02:13:18,055
Boo girls can't play Basketball.

1142
02:13:18,056 --> 02:13:19,890
He said the truth and you
fought with him.

1143
02:13:19,891 --> 02:13:22,793
Why! In college Ms. Anjali beat
you everyday in Basketball.

1144
02:13:23,329 --> 02:13:29,029
Shh ! Quiet !
Not everyday, sometimes.

1145
02:13:30,534 --> 02:13:34,131
- Rahul, you lost everyday.
- Remember Anjali, you lost everyday.

1146
02:13:35,306 --> 02:13:37,442
Rahul, you lost everyday.
- No Anjali.

1147
02:13:37,443 --> 02:13:38,877
Yes Rahul.

1148
02:13:38,878 --> 02:13:41,345
Don't lie in front of
the kids.

1149
02:13:41,346 --> 02:13:44,448
What I'm lying?
- So am I lying? Liar.

1150
02:13:44,449 --> 02:13:46,051
What?

1151
02:13:46,052 --> 02:13:49,452
The truth is you could only
Hey! Don't call me a cheater.

1152
02:13:50,556 --> 02:13:53,684
That's what you are... a cheater.

1153
02:13:54,260 --> 02:13:56,694
Anjali, not cheater.
- Rahul is a cheater.

1154
02:14:14,346 --> 02:14:17,940
I challenge you right now,
let's play.

1155
02:14:22,355 --> 02:14:25,253
Don't be silly Anjali.

1156
02:14:25,658 --> 02:14:28,092
Why? Are you scared Rahul?

1157
02:14:30,895 --> 02:14:33,226
Rahul Khanna is never scared
of anyone.

1158
02:14:36,235 --> 02:14:39,635
We will see.
- We will see.

1159
02:14:52,818 --> 02:14:56,047
I'm sure Rahul will win.
- We will see!

1160
02:15:14,073 --> 02:15:16,801
You'll lose again Rahul.

1161
02:15:17,409 --> 02:15:20,140
I've been practicing for
8 years, I won't lose.

1162
02:15:23,480 --> 02:15:26,144
Listen, be careful
with your saree.

1163
02:15:31,588 --> 02:15:34,146
Don't hit me.

1164
02:16:00,653 --> 02:16:03,052
What was that!

1165
02:17:19,331 --> 02:17:22,232
Hey! Lf you can't play
atleast don't cheat.

1166
02:17:22,233 --> 02:17:24,367
Hey! Don't call me a cheater.

1167
02:17:24,368 --> 02:17:27,461
That's what you are -
a teacher... cheater.

1168
02:18:54,491 --> 02:18:58,518
"There is a strange girl,
she is a dream..."

1169
02:18:59,063 --> 02:19:01,327
"ls she for real or a story"

1170
02:19:02,300 --> 02:19:05,167
"Look at this mad one,

02:19:06,604 --> 02:19:08,936
"She is still the same

1172
02:19:18,315 --> 02:19:22,251
"There is a strange boy,

"He is still the same
crazy one"

1176
02:20:22,045 --> 02:20:25,572
"We were close and yet so far
those were strange circumstances"

1177
02:20:30,287 --> 02:20:36,385
" Those were strange times
when you were so close "

1178
02:20:37,894 --> 02:20:44,630
" Where are you lost, I'm right
here if only you would look "

1179
02:21:59,376 --> 02:22:01,845
" I was lonesome even in a crowd "

1180
02:22:03,247 --> 02:22:05,976
"You were forever in my memory"

1181
02:22:07,152 --> 02:22:13,555
"lf someone stops me now
my heart will brim over"

1182
02:22:14,958 --> 02:22:21,364
"I can't stand steady
only you can help now"

1183
02:22:30,974 --> 02:22:35,036
"There is a strange girl,
she is a dream..."

1184
02:22:35,479 --> 02:22:37,708
"ls she for real or a story"

1185

02:22:42,987 --> 02:22:45,716
"He is still the same crazy one"

1187
02:23:18,890 --> 02:23:25,055
"You gave me dreams"

1188
02:23:30,935 --> 02:23:33,733
"I am neither awake
nor asleep"

1189
02:23:38,375 --> 02:23:41,106
"Somethings happen in my heart..."

1190
02:23:46,183 --> 02:23:48,777
"Somethings happen in my heart..."

1191
02:23:59,697 --> 02:24:02,288
Mamata here's your letter.

1192
02:24:02,900 --> 02:24:04,834
All your mothers are
complaining that...

1193
02:24:04,835 --> 02:24:07,634
you all are not writing to them and
I have complained to your mother...

1194
02:24:08,171 --> 02:24:11,072
...that you don't say anything.

1195
02:24:14,313 --> 02:24:16,679
Everyone is going to write
home, in front of me.

1196
02:24:18,750 --> 02:24:21,285
Here pass these on.

1197
02:24:21,286 --> 02:24:24,184
Anjali, come on write a
letterto your mom...

1198
02:24:56,188 --> 02:25:02,056
If you were here, you'd be proud of
Anjali being your daughter.

1199
02:25:06,529 --> 02:25:09,122
Because she's so nice.

1200
02:25:11,402 --> 02:25:13,962
She has to be, her name's
Anjali after all.

1201
02:25:19,411 --> 02:25:22,742
But the best thing about
her is that...

1202
02:25:25,582 --> 02:25:28,572
...she looks just like you.

1203
02:25:30,387 --> 02:25:33,288
The same eyes, the same face.

1204
02:25:56,179 --> 02:25:58,581
I don't find this family
incomplete anymore...

1205
02:26:03,420 --> 02:26:06,983
Hello kids! Good morning.
Are you ready?

1206
02:26:08,324 --> 02:26:11,155
Say cheese.

1207
02:26:13,197 --> 02:26:16,563
Taking photographs without me?
Anyway I'm here now.

1208
02:26:21,739 --> 02:26:23,764
My saree looks nice?
- Beautiful.

1209
02:26:24,474 --> 02:26:26,806
Shall I sit there?
- Come sit please.

1210
02:26:30,347 --> 02:26:33,313
No not there, a little higher.

1211
02:26:34,085 --> 02:26:36,486
No not there, a little higher.

1212
02:26:36,487 --> 02:26:39,479
Where is he sending me? Higher.

1213
02:26:40,125 --> 02:26:43,615
Little higher. Yes.
- Shall I sit here?

1214
02:26:46,965 --> 02:26:49,831
How do I look?
- Fantastic, beautiful.

1215
02:27:12,990 --> 02:27:15,479
What happened?

1216
02:27:15,793 --> 02:27:18,990
I don't know. Something
is missing. Something wrong.

1217
02:27:22,565 --> 02:27:24,895
Okay now?

1218
02:27:31,474 --> 02:27:34,704
Lt's perfect. Shoot it.

1219
02:27:39,183 --> 02:27:42,208
Excuse me. Now one of
just the 2 of you.

1220
02:27:49,161 --> 02:27:51,694
No Mr. Almieda, enough.

1221
02:27:51,695 --> 02:27:54,422
Anjali, just one.

1222
02:27:55,431 --> 02:27:57,922
Colonel, please colonel, really.
- Come on Anjali.

1223
02:28:10,180 --> 02:28:13,309
Wow! How can anyone look
so good?

1224
02:28:14,518 --> 02:28:17,578
Yes! Anjali is looking
very nice here.

1225
02:28:18,154 --> 02:28:19,955
Really, I didn't even
notice her.

1226
02:28:19,956 --> 02:28:26,123
Liar. She's not here so you
What to do mother-in-law?

1227
02:28:28,865 --> 02:28:31,266
Aman, Since the wedding is
in December...

1228
02:28:31,868 --> 02:28:33,535
...why don't you go back
to London for a while?

1229
02:28:33,536 --> 02:28:36,268
I'm not budging from here.
- Why?

1230
02:28:37,440 --> 02:28:40,544
I don't trust your daughter.

1231
02:28:40,545 --> 02:28:43,945
She's taken forever, to agree
forthe marriage. Till we don't...

1232
02:28:45,215 --> 02:28:46,383
Tie the knot...
- Yes!

1233
02:28:46,384 --> 02:28:49,250
Tie the knot I'm not
going anywhere.

1234
02:28:50,454 --> 02:28:52,921
You love her a lot don't you?

1235
02:28:52,922 --> 02:28:55,822
No... Yes.

1236
02:28:58,063 --> 02:29:02,500
But I get the feeling
she doesn't love me.

1237
02:29:08,905 --> 02:29:11,532
She doesn't, right?

1238
02:29:13,411 --> 02:29:16,846
Hey! Mother-in-law...
she doesn't right?

1239
02:29:19,115 --> 02:29:21,175
Aman, you've gone mad.

1240
02:29:29,592 --> 02:29:31,526
She didn't answer.

1241
02:29:31,527 --> 02:29:33,964
Today we are going to play
a new game.

1242
02:29:33,965 --> 02:29:35,598
It's called Dumb Charades.

1243
02:29:35,599 --> 02:29:38,067
In this game there are 2 teams.

1244
02:29:38,068 --> 02:29:40,899
This is team A.

1245
02:29:42,072 --> 02:29:44,833
And this is team B.

1246
02:29:46,277 --> 02:29:51,078
One team will secretly tell
1 or2 members of the otherteam...

1247
02:29:51,615 --> 02:29:54,015
...the name of a film

1248
02:29:54,685 --> 02:29:59,815
The players have to act
out the film

1249
02:30:00,424 --> 02:30:03,791
And make theirteammates
guess the name of the film.

1250
02:30:04,661 --> 02:30:08,621
You can't say anything.
Simple! We'll start with team A

1251
02:30:15,305 --> 02:30:18,400
Yes! But how do I do this?

1252
02:30:27,051 --> 02:30:28,984
Now look, it's like...

1253
02:30:28,985 --> 02:30:31,510
You can't say anything.
Cheating...

1254
02:30:33,891 --> 02:30:37,382
This is cheating,
you are a cheater.

1255
02:30:39,863 --> 02:30:41,956
Come on! Can't you do this much.
Come on.

1256
02:30:53,043 --> 02:30:56,170
Yeah! Everybody yeah!
She's doing it.

1257
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:21,839
"The Colourful One"

1258
02:31:21,840 --> 02:31:24,170
Yeah! That's right.
- "The Colourful One" yes.

1259
02:31:31,248 --> 02:31:37,676
You were really sexy!
- Thanks.

1260
02:31:42,960 --> 02:31:45,054
No, no, no,
I can't do this.

1261
02:31:45,795 --> 02:31:49,025
Come on granny...

1262
02:31:50,667 --> 02:31:53,828
At this age kids! No. No

1263
02:31:54,036 --> 02:31:56,105
Even I don't see Hindi films,
you know.

1264
02:31:56,106 --> 02:31:59,335
I like"Gone with the wind"
- Shut up!

1265
02:32:03,081 --> 02:32:05,308
Okay son.

1266
02:32:06,417 --> 02:32:07,749
But she's my mom.

1267
02:32:07,750 --> 02:32:09,518
You go there.
- Where?

1268
02:32:09,519 --> 02:32:11,553
Go there...
- Why?

1269
02:32:11,554 --> 02:32:14,758
Becuase I'm telling you that's why.
- Granny gone mad.

1270
02:32:14,759 --> 02:32:17,560
Yeah! Now bend.
- Bend.

1271
02:32:17,561 --> 02:32:19,958
Like this?

1272
02:32:36,980 --> 02:32:39,038
Mummy... Madhuri...
"How Are We Related"

1273
02:32:44,588 --> 02:32:47,215
lt's my turn.

1274
02:32:51,228 --> 02:32:52,562
There's no such film.

1275
02:32:52,563 --> 02:32:55,264
There is papa.
- No there isn't.

1276
02:32:55,265 --> 02:32:57,732
There is.
- But I haven't seen any such film.

1277
02:32:57,733 --> 02:32:59,669
But, hey wait a minute.

1278
02:32:59,670 --> 02:33:02,639
Ofcourse, it's a film.
I've seen it myself.

1279
02:33:03,373 --> 02:33:06,204
But what is the name
of the film.

1280
02:33:18,521 --> 02:33:21,456
Three... three words.

1281
02:33:26,831 --> 02:33:30,230
Yes I've understood there
are three words, what else?

1282
02:33:32,502 --> 02:33:35,336
Rahul, what are you doing?
- Your son has gone mad.

1283
02:33:39,911 --> 02:33:42,174
Rahul I can't understand anything,
what are you doing?

1284
02:33:55,425 --> 02:33:57,893
What is it?

1285
02:34:03,800 --> 02:34:06,698
I love you...

1286
02:34:13,545 --> 02:34:16,068
Do it again...

1287
02:34:20,652 --> 02:34:23,550
I love you.

1288
02:34:29,560 --> 02:34:32,323
You couldn't do that much?
- No.

1289
02:34:33,162 --> 02:34:36,289
I wish you would've,
we would have won.

1290
02:34:43,039 --> 02:34:46,439
Come on kids, hurry up get into
the barn...

1291
02:35:03,293 --> 02:35:06,158
Hey give me that, thanks.

1292
02:35:13,036 --> 02:35:15,797
Have you gone mad?

1293
02:35:18,608 --> 02:35:21,634
I'm feeling very cold.

1294
02:35:23,179 --> 02:35:26,409
Come with me. L'll take you
to a place.

1295
02:35:53,777 --> 02:35:56,266
No music.

1296
02:38:39,143 --> 02:38:41,337
I love you.

1297
02:38:47,951 --> 02:38:51,043
Hey! I love you too.

1298
02:38:58,429 --> 02:39:01,555
Almeida you can't even
fix a leakage. Go on, go up.

1299
02:39:02,599 --> 02:39:04,999
Mom, did Anjali come here?
- Her she is.

1300
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:06,803
No... not this one,
the other one.

1301
02:39:06,804 --> 02:39:09,668
Here hold this and help.

1302
02:39:16,447 --> 02:39:20,438
I want to talk with you.

1303
02:39:25,722 --> 02:39:28,518
You call this sty a summer camp?

1304
02:39:29,725 --> 02:39:34,822
Hi guys! Hey, I know you from
somewhere.

1305
02:39:35,698 --> 02:39:38,427
Telephone man.

1306
02:39:39,869 --> 02:39:42,599
What's up dude.
What're you doing here?

1307
02:39:46,876 --> 02:39:49,502
Ls that your Anjali?

1308
02:39:53,949 --> 02:39:56,780
This is my Anjali.

1309
02:39:58,554 --> 02:40:01,286
And this, is my Anjali.

1310
02:40:21,978 --> 02:40:24,312
You're just like Michael Jordan.
You're too good.

1311
02:40:24,313 --> 02:40:27,213
L'am not that good.
I've been beaten.

1312
02:40:27,850 --> 02:40:30,581
I don't believe it... Who won?

1313
02:40:31,855 --> 02:40:35,057
Anjali.
- Your Anjali.

1314
02:40:35,058 --> 02:40:37,822
No, your Anjali.
- My Anjali...

1315
02:40:39,095 --> 02:40:41,618
She played basketball?

1316
02:40:42,099 --> 02:40:47,091
Tell me, what kind of a girl
was she in college?

1317
02:40:48,771 --> 02:40:50,538
She was the life and pride
our college.

1318
02:40:50,539 --> 02:40:53,542
Everyone came to herwith
their problems.

1319
02:40:53,543 --> 02:40:55,210
Well, nothings changed.

1320
02:40:55,211 --> 02:40:58,702
Even I've come to herwith
my problem.

1321
02:40:59,382 --> 02:41:01,974
What problem do you have?

1322
02:41:02,286 --> 02:41:05,846
My problem is that
I love hertoo much, you know.

1323
02:41:06,956 --> 02:41:09,185
I know.

1324
02:41:11,393 --> 02:41:14,096
What kind of friend are you?

1325
02:41:14,097 --> 02:41:16,364
You didn't even come
for our engagement.

1326
02:41:16,365 --> 02:41:18,890
You're engaged?

1327
02:41:20,438 --> 02:41:23,538
Yes, but with great difficulty.

1328
02:41:23,539 --> 02:41:25,804
The wedding is in December,
hopefully.

1329
02:41:28,010 --> 02:41:30,980
Hey! Tell your friend...

1330
02:41:30,981 --> 02:41:33,114
If she doesn't marry
me in December...

1331
02:41:33,115 --> 02:41:37,246
l'll... marry this basketball.

1332
02:41:56,271 --> 02:41:58,796
We live once, we die once,

1333
02:42:00,009 --> 02:42:03,001
we get married once and
love...

1334
02:42:21,063 --> 02:42:24,293
Men are very weak...

1335
02:42:28,170 --> 02:42:31,003
They make principles but
don't realise that...

1336
02:42:31,573 --> 02:42:34,235
...no principle can override
the heart.

1337
02:42:36,779 --> 02:42:41,512
And we remind these stubborn
weak men that...

1338
02:42:42,185 --> 02:42:45,916
...bonds of the heart are based
on feelings not principles.

1339
02:42:48,957 --> 02:42:51,560
But these bonds are created...

1340
02:42:51,561 --> 02:42:54,789
...by telling the other person
about one's inner feelings.

1341
02:42:58,333 --> 02:43:01,301
Tell him what you feel Anjali.

1342
02:43:05,009 --> 02:43:08,306
Sometimes saying what one feels
can break one's heart.

1343
02:43:10,213 --> 02:43:12,806
But by not saying it you won't,
be happy.

1344
02:43:24,661 --> 02:43:27,563
Congratulations and
celebrations...

1345
02:43:28,231 --> 02:43:31,028
...we wish Ms. Anjali a
happy wedded life.

1346
02:43:33,103 --> 02:43:35,469
Congratulations and
celebrations...

1347
02:43:38,574 --> 02:43:41,176
Anjali, you didn't even
tell me.

1348
02:43:41,177 --> 02:43:44,268
Aman told me that you
are getting married.

1349
02:43:46,582 --> 02:43:48,983
Are you happy?

1350
02:43:48,984 --> 02:43:51,252
You are happy, aren't you?

1351
02:43:51,253 --> 02:43:54,055
Having heard this, are
you happy?

1352
02:43:54,056 --> 02:43:56,425
I'm very happy.

1353
02:43:56,426 --> 02:43:59,291
Then how can I be happy?

1354
02:43:59,697 --> 02:44:02,060
I don't understand.

1355
02:44:03,365 --> 02:44:07,166
Somethings happen Rahul,
you won't understand.

1356
02:44:16,613 --> 02:44:20,572
Somethings happen Anjali...
you won't understand.

1357
02:44:28,424 --> 02:44:31,688
Uncle, May I ask you something?
- Sure

1358
02:44:32,394 --> 02:44:34,693
Why are you marrying Ms. Anjali?

1359
02:44:36,032 --> 02:44:38,300
What? Why? Ls something wrong?

1360
02:44:38,301 --> 02:44:43,034
Yeah! Lt's simple.
You're so handsome.

1361
02:44:45,308 --> 02:44:47,209
What happened?
- So good-looking.

1362
02:44:47,210 --> 02:44:49,678
Oh! Thank you so much.

1363
02:44:49,679 --> 02:44:52,908
But Ms. Anjali is not
that good looking.

1364
02:44:54,018 --> 02:44:57,545
You're right. She's dark,
fat and short.

1365
02:44:59,688 --> 02:45:02,057
You know, you can get anyone.

1366
02:45:02,058 --> 02:45:04,459
Anyone?
- Yes!

1367
02:45:04,460 --> 02:45:08,157
Then will you marry me?
- Me? No, no, no...

1368
02:45:09,099 --> 02:45:11,826
Why am I that bad?

1369
02:45:12,367 --> 02:45:14,699
Then you'll have to find
me a nice girl.

1370
02:45:15,338 --> 02:45:17,205
Found her.
- Who?

1371
02:45:17,206 --> 02:45:19,435
She.

1372
02:45:23,581 --> 02:45:26,549
This MTV one? Hi!
This is the Neelam Show... Yo!

1373
02:45:29,219 --> 02:45:31,220
Then what about this Anjali?

1374
02:45:31,221 --> 02:45:32,787
You'll have to find someone
for hertoo.

1375
02:45:32,788 --> 02:45:35,223
Found him.
- Found him?

1376
02:45:35,224 --> 02:45:37,989
Shall I tell you?
- No, no, no...

1377
02:45:38,595 --> 02:45:41,460
Please, let me tell you.
- No, no, no...

1378
02:45:43,266 --> 02:45:46,289
I want to leave tonight itself.

1379
02:46:28,277 --> 02:46:30,903
Goodbye Mr. Almeida

1380
02:47:09,652 --> 02:47:12,413
You're leaving?

1381
02:47:15,525 --> 02:47:18,219
Please don't go.

1382
02:48:29,632 --> 02:48:34,161
You gave this to Tina when
she was beginning a new life.

1383
02:48:38,474 --> 02:48:41,634
Today you are going to begin
a new life...

1384
02:48:45,414 --> 02:48:51,149
...and I am sure, you and Rahul
Start preparing forthe wedding.

1385
02:49:48,376 --> 02:49:50,580
I don't want to wait anymore.

1386
02:49:50,581 --> 02:49:53,947
But Guruji said that there is no
auspicious date before December...

1387
02:49:54,483 --> 02:49:59,887
Mother, dates don't bring
happiness, destiny does...

1388
02:50:01,823 --> 02:50:04,724
...and no one can change that.

1389
02:51:22,972 --> 02:51:25,372
Look! Aman's here and
that too on a mule.

1390
02:51:32,014 --> 02:51:35,345
Bindya... Panditji has come. Leave
everything and look after him.

1391
02:51:39,054 --> 02:51:45,460
You are Rahul, right?
- Yes, Anjali and I...

1392
02:51:46,161 --> 02:51:48,229
I know.

1393
02:51:48,230 --> 02:51:50,288

1394
02:51:52,100 --> 02:51:57,163
Yes. She decided to get married
so suddenly that...

1395
02:51:58,039 --> 02:52:01,509
...I didn't get any time to
prepare...

1396
02:52:01,876 --> 02:52:07,610
Yes, I'm coming.
Please sit, l'll just be back.

1397
02:52:15,625 --> 02:52:17,853
Anjali!

1398
02:52:18,594 --> 02:52:21,961
They say if you make a
wish on a shooting star...

1399
02:52:22,664 --> 02:52:25,529
...it comes true...

1400
02:55:56,979 --> 02:55:59,106
The auspicious time is running
out, please call the bride.

1401
02:56:00,483 --> 02:56:02,710

1403
02:56:11,092 --> 02:56:13,957

1404
02:57:03,078 --> 02:57:05,808
L'll drag you to the marriage
pandal, I told you so didn't I?

1405
02:58:05,840 --> 02:58:10,175
You know, I always wanted to see
that love in your eyes...

1406
02:58:11,847 --> 02:58:14,608
...that I have in mine.

1407
02:58:15,451 --> 02:58:20,581
Today, I've seen it,
but it's not for me.

1408
02:58:23,425 --> 02:58:27,920
You're mad Anjali.
You've always loved him

1409
02:58:30,965 --> 02:58:34,366
Eversince you've known love,
understood love...

1410
02:58:36,005 --> 02:58:38,836
...You've loved only him.

1411
02:58:39,009 --> 02:58:42,032
Rahul is your first love...

1412
02:58:44,012 --> 02:58:47,072
...and no one understands
first love more than I do.

1413
02:58:53,021 --> 02:58:58,085
You were going to give this
all up for me? Stupid!

1414
02:59:01,597 --> 02:59:04,462
How can I come between
this love...

1415
02:59:06,702 --> 02:59:09,692
...that was never mine
in the first place?

1416
02:59:13,909 --> 02:59:16,036
And anyway, someone told
me that...

1417
02:59:16,644 --> 02:59:19,875
...l'm so handsome,
I can get anyone.

1418
02:59:34,128 --> 02:59:37,152
