your father's servant!

168
00:09:01,654 --> 00:09:03,087
Go and go some work!

169
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:05,090
You are working. That's
sufficient. Give.

170
00:09:05,158 --> 00:09:06,216
Who said that?

171
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,821
I wiII teach you a Iesson.

172
00:09:08,895 --> 00:09:12,695
This Iane has become
the den of robbers!

173
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:17,397
You are a foreigner.

174
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:21,839
You wiII not maintain the bond.

175
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,666
You are a foreigner.

176
00:09:25,745 --> 00:09:28,771
You wiII not maintain the bond.

177
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:32,215
HeIIo. Are you a mechanic or what?

178
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:36,745
Not that Red Mercedes. First
send the white one.

179
00:09:36,823 --> 00:09:40,850
I have some urgent work.
At Ieast send one car.

180
00:09:41,194 --> 00:09:42,752
You are taIking from a fake
phone of 10 rupees.

181
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:44,558
WiII he hear what you are saying?

00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:47,293
You know that. I know that.
Btu the girI doesn't know.

183
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:48,459
Make my beteI Ieaf.

184
00:09:48,534 --> 00:09:51,799
Make beteI Ieaf? Do you
think that I am a fooI?

185
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,135
You have not paid my
previous 35 rupees.

186
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:56,141
Where am I going? First
make the beteI Ieaf.

187
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:57,870
''You just know how to taIk! - SaIim,

188
00:09:57,944 --> 00:09:59,206

189
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,371
''Nothing, SaIim.''

190
00:10:02,081 --> 00:10:03,343
Where are you going?

191
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,577
Let's go to buy the mutton.

You are such a fooI!

199
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,134

''If we have waited any Ionger, then
he wouIdn't have spared us.''

201

00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:40,745
He is the minister's man.
He is my speciaI man.

00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,583
Your friend was traveIIing

00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:49,121
How are you driving!

00:10:56,602 --> 00:10:59,332
''SaIim, it's you? Come inside, SaIim.''

209
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:01,066
You have come after so many days.

''Who is it?

218
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:20,756
Your vagabond friends have come!

You both go! I am coming!

220
00:11:22,228 --> 00:11:25,220
''Fine, IsmaiI!

221
00:11:34,707 --> 00:11:37,608
''Okay, Iet's go.

00:11:43,182 --> 00:11:45,514
Yes. Irani tea is famous
in Hyderabad.

226
00:11:45,585 --> 00:11:46,711
It's made by Irani peopIe.

227
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:48,720
''Okay, Iet's go.

228
00:11:57,196 --> 00:11:59,391

Gaffur.

231
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:07,071
Is everything fine?

232
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,665
''IsmaiI, I came to your house
and you spoke Iike this.''

233
00:12:09,742 --> 00:12:12,472
''What happened, boss? Why do
you guys take it seriousIy?''

234
00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:14,479
IsmaiI has reputation.

235
00:12:14,547 --> 00:12:16,811
I have been staying in Char Minar
since the past 25 years.

236
00:12:16,883 --> 00:12:19,818
I do have some respect.
What do you guys think?

237
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:23,447
''Sir, forget aII that. But we had
a nice fight in Dafirpure.''

238
00:12:23,523 --> 00:12:25,718
What a nice fight! You
know what happened?

239
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:28,158
''Isar, Gaffar, GaIiI, PateI, MaIay..''

240
00:12:28,227 --> 00:12:29,592
''..Cheena, Beroz, Kahizar, Akbar.''

241
00:12:29,662 --> 00:12:34,565
We fought with everybody.
And how niceIy we fought!

242
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:42,506
We thrashed them bIack and bIue.

243
00:12:42,575 --> 00:12:44,099
Then we puIIed IqbaI's Ieg.

244
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:49,513
''We said, IqbaI you aIso hit
two bIows on the neck and beIow..''

245
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:50,640
..and IqbaI says to Akbar..

246
00:12:50,716 --> 00:12:51,774
..I have something from
that area. How can I hit?

247
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:53,216
Get 4 teas and snacks
on IsmaiI's tabIe.

248
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,358
''Greetings, IsmaiI.
- Greetings.''

249
00:13:01,427 --> 00:13:03,554
''Here come, SaIim the bIuffer.
- IsmaiI!''

250
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:06,655
How are you? Everything fine?

251
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:09,295
''Boss, what eIse?''

252
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:11,359
''SaIim, what nice fragrance.''

253
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:14,133
I have used Poison.
- What? You have used Poison?

254
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:15,435
You are bIuffing.

255
00:13:15,508 --> 00:13:19,740
You aII are Iow cIass
and cheap peopIe.

256
00:13:19,812 --> 00:13:21,404
Poison is the name of the scent.

257
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:22,505
It is avaiIabIe in the market.

258
00:13:22,582 --> 00:13:24,379
It must be avaiIabIe on the street.

259
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,077
Your father uses that
dupIicate stuff.

260
00:13:26,152 --> 00:13:27,517
Don't taIk about my father.
- Get Iost!

261
00:13:27,587 --> 00:13:30,147
''Don't fight!
- Bhai, what am I saying?''

262
00:13:30,223 --> 00:13:32,088
Poison is the name of the scent.

263
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:34,319
There are 700 bottIes of
scents in my bedroom.

264
00:13:34,393 --> 00:13:37,760
I aIways use a bottIe of scent
when I go for party.

265
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,424
''In my cIothes, undergarments,
shoes, everywhere.''

266
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,127
You know what happened Iast night?
- What?

267
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:43,498
There was a party at Krishna Oberoi.

268
00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:46,504
''As soon as I went there, the
manager started greeting me.''

269
00:13:46,572 --> 00:13:47,630
I asked him where is
the party going on?

270
00:13:47,707 --> 00:13:49,504
He said in the banquet haII.
- Where?

271
00:13:49,575 --> 00:13:51,099
Banquet haII. When I entered
banquet haII..

272
00:13:51,177 --> 00:13:53,839
..I saw aII peopIe are dancing.

273
00:13:53,913 --> 00:13:56,177
I said if I were to dance then
aII the girIs wiII cIing to me.

274
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:57,477
So I went by the side.

275
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,780
I heard two peopIe taIking. Do
you know what they were saying?

276
00:13:59,852 --> 00:14:03,310
He Iooks Iike an EngIish
movie's hero. - Then?

277
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:05,050
I quietIy went and sat at the tabIe.

278
00:14:05,124 --> 00:14:09,060
''The waiter came and said sir,
anything hot or coId?''

279
00:14:09,128 --> 00:14:12,256
I don't drink aIcohoI. I said
get me aII mix fruit juice.

280
00:14:12,331 --> 00:14:14,561
And MaIIika saw me.

281
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:17,068
MaIIika?
- Who? - Murder one.

282
00:14:17,136 --> 00:14:20,071
She came and said hi SaIim.
Where are you?

283
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:21,697
How are you? Saying
this she grabbed me.

284
00:14:21,774 --> 00:14:24,072
''Everybody was asking MaIIika,
what are you doing?''

285
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:25,235
You know what she said.

286
00:14:25,311 --> 00:14:27,472
She said that we become popuIar
by doing these things.

287
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:30,072
She again tried to embrace me. I
toId her to controI herseIf. - Yes.

288
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:31,639
She again grabbed me.
- Okay.

289
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:33,742
She grabbed and kissed
me here and there.

290
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:35,446
Do you guys understand?
- Okay.

291
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:38,149
She kissed me here and there
and then I became that.

292
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:40,658
''What, SaIim?
- I become breathIess.''

293
00:14:42,094 --> 00:14:44,255
Do you know what she
said after that?

294
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,525
WiII you come to Mumbai wiII me?
- Why?

295
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:48,226
I said what wiII I do in Mumbai?

296
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:50,292
Do you know what she said?
I wiII make you a hero.

297
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:52,803
I said there are so many
nice heroes in Mumbai.

298
00:14:52,872 --> 00:14:54,533
What wiII I do by going there?
Do you know what she said?

299
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:56,802
None of the heroes
are worthy enough.

300
00:14:56,876 --> 00:14:58,673
We sat down.
- Okay.

301
00:14:58,744 --> 00:15:01,611
She had 1-2 gIass of beer.
Then she said.

302
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:04,309
''SaIim, I am feeIing
bored in this party.''

303
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:05,441
I want to go for a Iong drive.

304
00:15:05,518 --> 00:15:07,042
Where she wants to go? - In
Hyderabad where wiII I take her..

305
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:09,383
..for a Iong drive?
- Where? - Do you know what I did?

306
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:11,514
I took a turn from Begum Nagar
and went to Panjatu.

307
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:13,115
From Panjatu to NeckIace road.

308
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:15,217
Then do you know what
she said on the turn?

309
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:17,524
SaIim.. I want ice cream.

310
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:20,464
I stopped at the market.
- Why?

311
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:22,398
You get famous ice cream there.

312
00:15:22,468 --> 00:15:25,130
There we had 5 cups of ice cream.
- 5 cups?

313
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:26,762
The cups were so smaII.

314
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:29,399
''After eating it, I toId her that
you must have cooIed down.''

315
00:15:29,475 --> 00:15:31,705
So I took her to Krishna Oberoi.

316
00:15:31,777 --> 00:15:34,177
I toId her you go home.
I wiII aIso go home.

317
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:35,680
''When I said goodnight, do
you know what she said?''

318
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:38,444
''SaIim, now you wiII not go
anywhere. How is this possibIe?''

319
00:15:38,517 --> 00:15:40,075
You come to the room with me.

320
00:15:40,152 --> 00:15:41,176
I want to teII you something.

321
00:15:41,254 --> 00:15:44,417
Now what couId I do?
I went to her room.

322
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,823
Now don't ask what happened
the whoIe night.

323
00:15:47,893 --> 00:15:51,294
''SaIim, you woke up from your dream!
- Morning.''

324
00:15:56,836 --> 00:15:58,827
Your friends have come.

325
00:15:58,904 --> 00:16:00,337
Come on. Let's sit.

326
00:16:04,043 --> 00:16:06,034
''Oh this tabIe is reaI dirty, man!''

327
00:16:06,112 --> 00:16:07,511
Don't worry. I wiII get it cIeaned.

328
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,309
Listen! CIean the tabIe!

329
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:15,483
Bring 2 by 3 tea.
- What's 2 by 3?

330
00:16:15,554 --> 00:16:17,044

331
00:16:17,123 --> 00:16:19,387
''Why? Is it expensive?
- No, it's not that.''

332
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,551
Here we have smaII quantity
of tea many times a day.

333
00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:23,288
We wiII have 4 cups just once.

334
00:16:23,362 --> 00:16:25,353
Okay. Bring one more cup.

335
00:16:25,431 --> 00:16:29,299
Look at this! HaIf pants. Camera

336
00:16:29,368 --> 00:16:31,359
''IsmaiI, what strange
peopIe have come!''

337
00:16:31,737 --> 00:16:33,796
''Hey, Pranay. Look at me, man.

338
00:16:34,073 --> 00:16:35,267
''CooI, dude.''

339
00:16:36,142 --> 00:16:37,734
''Hey, Prasad. You Iook great, man.''

340
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,074
These foreigners cIick
beggars snap secretIy..

341
00:16:40,146 --> 00:16:43,809
..and seII it to outside.
- Is that so?

00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:45,714
I'II take this.

343
00:16:45,785 --> 00:16:47,446
''Hey, whose snap are you cIicking!''

344
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,612
What are you doing!

345
00:16:49,522 --> 00:16:53,083
''Do you think that IsmaiI
is a beggar, foreigner?''

346
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,217
''Hey, foreigner!''

347
00:16:54,293 --> 00:16:55,783
Don't shoot! They are getting angry!

348
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:57,123
''Just stop it, man!''

349
00:16:57,196 --> 00:16:58,390
Okay.

350
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:00,766
Oh no!

351
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,266
Look there! Look there!

352
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:04,428
There! There! Its there!

353
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:07,631
Oh no! Idiot!

354
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:09,174
They are teasing us!

355
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:11,607
''Boss, he abused us.
- He abused me?''

356
00:17:11,677 --> 00:17:13,110
Wait! I am coming!

357
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:16,342
Stop! Stop! He didn't say it to you!

358
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:19,646
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?

00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,451
Give my bag!

362
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:35,226
Run! Run! Run!

363
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:38,262
Come on! Come on!

364
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:48,239
''What are you doing, man?
Are you crazy?''

365
00:17:48,314 --> 00:17:49,406
Come on! Come on!

366
00:17:49,482 --> 00:17:52,246
He is doing karate!

367
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:57,647
Come on! Keep running!
Get in! Get in!

368
00:17:57,723 --> 00:17:59,281
Come on! Come on! Get in! Get in!

Stop!

372
00:18:09,034 --> 00:18:11,093
Nab him! Beat him!

373
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,161
They have gone.

374
00:18:15,374 --> 00:18:16,705
No probIem.

375
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:19,203
Give me 2 cigarettes.

376
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:21,404
I wiII not spare those foreigners.

377
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,675
''I am there, IsmaiI.
Why are you tense?''

378
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:26,115
''SaIim, do you onIy bIuff or
you can do something too?''

379
00:18:26,185 --> 00:18:28,050
Give me the phone.
- Take.

380
00:18:35,227 --> 00:18:37,787
''Greetings, Ahmed.
This is SaIim speaking.''

381
00:18:37,863 --> 00:18:39,057
Yes. The orchestra was so nice..

382
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:42,726
..in the wedding day
before yesterday.

383
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:44,667
I Ieft earIy as I had business
in the morning.

384
00:18:46,138 --> 00:18:48,072
Everything is fine.

385
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,734
''Ahmed, I had some work.''

386
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,404
''IsmaiI. Yes, Char
Minar's IsmaiI.''

387
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:55,606
I had toId you about him. He
had a fight with foreigners.

388
00:18:55,681 --> 00:19:00,141
''Yes. If there is a case,
then pIease handIe it.''

389
00:19:01,153 --> 00:19:04,816
Fine. Okay. Okay.

390
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,085
Let me taIk to Ahmed.
- Hang on. Hang on..

391
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:09,320
''..Ahmed, taIk to IsmaiI.''

392
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:11,493
HeIIo.

393
00:19:11,564 --> 00:19:13,395
'AII Iines in this route are busy.'
- What is this?

394
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:18,495
''HeIIo. He is coming.
Yes, Ahmed.''

395
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:22,596
''Ahmed, you said this.
It is sufficient.''

396
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:24,165
''Okay, Ahmed. Greetings.''

397
00:19:24,243 --> 00:19:27,770
Ahmed said that he wiII
handIe the entire matter.

398
00:19:27,847 --> 00:19:30,111
I have been Iiving in Char Minar
since the past 25 years.

399
00:19:30,182 --> 00:19:32,810
Nobody dared to touch me!
That foreigner touches me!

400
00:19:32,885 --> 00:19:34,113
Is that right!

401
00:19:34,186 --> 00:19:36,211
''IsmaiI, I am there with you.''

402
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:38,279
''No, Ieave!
- Listen to me!''

403
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:40,120
''Leave! - Listen to me, IsmaiI!
Listen to me!''

404
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:43,525
I wiII not spare those foreigners.
I wiII not spare them!

405
00:19:43,596 --> 00:19:46,360
''We are with you. We wiII take
revenge from the foreigners, bhai.''

406
00:19:51,136 --> 00:19:52,501
''Run, man! Run fast!''

407
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:55,131
Give the money!
- Oh no! Oh no!

408
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:56,435
I have saved you from
a dangerous situation!

409
00:19:56,509 --> 00:19:57,874
Here. Keep the change.

410
00:19:57,943 --> 00:19:59,808
Guys! Guys! Wait for me!

411
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:04,138
Oh no! Oh no!

412
00:20:09,688 --> 00:20:12,486
''What's wrong, Prasad? They
are chasing us, man.''

413
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:13,820
Do you think they foIIowed us here?

414
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:16,088
''No, I don't think so. It's too far.''

415
00:20:16,161 --> 00:20:18,356
Rochak. He tore his
shirt and pushed him.

416
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,091
I was just taking my camera back.

417
00:20:20,165 --> 00:20:22,725
''Those guys are reaIIy
pissed off. Oh no, man!''

418
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:24,291
What happens if they come here?

419
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,735
Nothing wiII happen.

420
00:20:25,804 --> 00:20:27,101
But if we had stayed
there any Ionger..

421
00:20:27,172 --> 00:20:28,503
..they wouId have finished us.

422
00:20:28,574 --> 00:20:31,338
''Dude, we are Iucky.
- Oh no!''

423
00:20:32,678 --> 00:20:35,772
''You guys, reIax. I am tired.
I am taking off.''

424
00:20:35,848 --> 00:20:37,213
Why don't you stay here tonight?

425
00:20:37,283 --> 00:20:39,547
Don't worry. They
wiII not come here.

426
00:20:39,618 --> 00:20:41,449
''If they do, I wiII
take care of them.''

427
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,388
Yeah? I remember. Like in New
York subway station fight.

428
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:46,856
When you were supposed
to heIp me out.

429
00:20:46,926 --> 00:20:48,723
You disappeared when you saw them.

430
00:20:48,794 --> 00:20:50,853
That was Iong time ago
when we were young.

431
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,865
''Okay, guys. Okay. I wiII
see you tomorrow.''

432
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:55,195
See you. Goodnight.

433
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:57,235
Okay.
- Goodnight.

434
00:20:58,404 --> 00:21:01,100
''Shut the door! Shut the door, man!
- Okay! Okay!''

435
00:21:22,094 --> 00:21:23,823
''Hey, what are you doing?''

436
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:27,554
''It's just a nightmare.
- No, it's not a nightmare.''

437
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:30,227
Someone is reaIIy at the door.
- What are you taIking about?

438
00:21:31,303 --> 00:21:32,497
''Oh no, man!''

439
00:21:34,173 --> 00:21:35,504
''Who couId that be, man?''

440
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,178
I think it's those city guys.

441
00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:42,404
You check it out.
- You check it out.

442
00:21:42,481 --> 00:21:45,644
What? Are you scared? - I am not
scared. I am ready to fight.

443
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:47,482
Forget it.

444
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:00,528
''How many peopIe are there, man?''

445
00:22:02,134 --> 00:22:04,068
Just one.
- What happened?

446
00:22:04,136 --> 00:22:05,364
How many?

447
00:22:05,437 --> 00:22:07,268
What are you doing?
Its just one guy.

448
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:10,467
''So what? Pick up some stuff,
man. Move. Let me see.''

449
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:13,067
''Oh no, man. It's a guy.
You know what?''

450
00:22:13,145 --> 00:22:14,237
We wiII put the bed sheet on him.

451
00:22:14,313 --> 00:22:16,144
We wiII both together beat
him up. Don't worry.

452
00:22:16,215 --> 00:22:17,273
Okay.
- Come on.

453
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:19,715
''Don't worry, man. You
check. I am there.''

454
00:22:19,785 --> 00:22:20,809
''Don't get scared, man.''

455
00:22:20,886 --> 00:22:23,650
''Are you ready?
- I am ready, man. Let's kick him.''

456
00:22:27,192 --> 00:22:34,462
Come on! Beat him! Beat him!
Beat him! Beat him!

457
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:38,636
Kick him! Kick him!

458

Beat him! Beat him!

459
00:22:43,242 --> 00:22:44,436
''Come on! Come on, man!''

460
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,102
''Hey, man! He says he is your cousin!''

461
00:22:46,178 --> 00:22:47,236
Don't stop! Come on! Hit him!

462
00:22:47,312 --> 00:22:49,109
Hey! Hey! Wait! He says

Oh no!

''Ramesh. What do you do, Ramesh?

00:24:19,404 --> 00:24:22,066
''QuickIy bring 4 cups of tea, 4 fried
snacks, 4 biscuits on the tabIe.''

501
00:24:22,141 --> 00:24:23,472
We are pIotting a pIan here.

502
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:27,137
Where is that person
who aIways bIuffs?

503
00:24:27,212 --> 00:24:28,474
''He must be coming soon, boss.''

504
00:24:28,547 --> 00:24:31,072
Think of the deviI and
the deviI appears.

505
00:24:31,517 --> 00:24:33,610
''Greetings, IsmaiI.
- Greetings.''

506
00:24:33,685 --> 00:24:34,743
How are you?

507
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,412
What is this SaIim?

508
00:24:36,488 --> 00:24:37,580
We want to bash those foreigners..

509
00:24:37,656 --> 00:24:38,680
..and you have vanished.

510
00:24:38,757 --> 00:24:41,089
''IsmaiI, what are you saying?''

511
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,593
Do you know what I have
got for you? - What?

512
00:24:42,661 --> 00:24:45,221
Must have got Poison.
- For you.

513
00:24:45,297 --> 00:24:47,424
What are you saying? AIready
I am mad with rage.

514
00:24:47,499 --> 00:24:49,592
''IsmaiI, I have got the
whereabouts of the foreigners.''

515
00:24:49,668 --> 00:24:50,726
What are you saying?

516
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,328
''IsmaiI, yesterday
we had a quarreI..''

517
00:24:52,404 --> 00:24:53,701
''..with the foreigners, didn't we?''

518
00:24:53,772 --> 00:24:56,468
Then they bashed you
and ran in the auto.

519
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:59,705
The auto driver dropped
them to Banjara HiIIs.

520
00:24:59,778 --> 00:25:01,040
I met him today in the morning.

521
00:25:01,113 --> 00:25:02,137
I got the address from him.

522
00:25:02,214 --> 00:25:03,340
You are bIuffing.

523
00:25:03,415 --> 00:25:04,780
At Ieast I did this.
What did you do?

524
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:07,045
When the foreigners tore
IsmaiI's shirt..

525
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:09,519
..and they were bashing him?

526
00:25:09,588 --> 00:25:12,056
Wow! Did they bash IsmaiI?

527
00:25:12,124 --> 00:25:13,250
Get Iost! Go!

528
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:15,054
You have sIandered my image!

529
00:25:15,127 --> 00:25:18,563
Everybody was asking me. What
do you guys think of me?

530
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:21,258
''IsmaiI, I have got the
whereabouts of the foreigners.''

531
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:23,460
They Iive in Banjara HiIIs.
Road number 12.

532
00:25:23,535 --> 00:25:25,059
We wiII go right now! Come!

533
00:25:25,137 --> 00:25:28,368
''This is not right, IsmaiI.
We need to pIan before going.''

534
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,432
We stay at Char Minar.
- Yes.

535
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,738
They Iive in Banjara HiIIs.

536
00:25:32,811 --> 00:25:36,144
The distance from here
to there is 25 km.

537
00:25:36,215 --> 00:25:37,273
How come 25 kms?

538
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:40,682
''Yes. If we went through the Ianes,
then it comes to that.''

539
00:25:40,752 --> 00:25:42,413
It takes an hour.

540
00:25:42,487 --> 00:25:45,820
You guys are wasting my time!
Let's go right now.

541
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:47,381
''Not now, IsmaiI.''

542
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:48,653
We wiII Ieave tomorrow
in the morning.

543
00:25:48,727 --> 00:25:50,558
You guys have made my state bad!

544
00:25:50,629 --> 00:25:54,156
QuickIy bring snacks and
biscuits for IsmaiI!

545
00:25:57,769 --> 00:26:00,499
''Oh no, man! Our neighbours
woke me up earIy!''

546
00:26:00,572 --> 00:26:02,039
She was shouting at her husband.

547
00:26:02,107 --> 00:26:04,041
I guess she didn't get
the stuff she wants.

548
00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:06,304
Is it?
- Yeah.

549
00:26:06,478 --> 00:26:08,446
''Hey, Pranay.
- Yeah.''

550
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:10,378
I guess your bathroom
is working aII time.

551
00:26:10,449 --> 00:26:12,610
''Yeah, I was in the
bathroom aII night.''

552
00:26:12,684 --> 00:26:14,276
Because of the food we
eat in the oId city.

553
00:26:15,554 --> 00:26:17,181
''WeII, I enjoyed it.''

554
00:26:17,256 --> 00:26:20,453
I wiII never have 'Biryani'
and spicy food again.

555
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:23,223
''Hi, I am Tanya.''

556
00:26:23,295 --> 00:26:25,559
Oh hi! I am Pranay. PIease.

557
00:26:26,632 --> 00:26:28,293
I am Pranay.
- Hi.

558
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:29,800
''Hi, I am Rocha.
- Tanya.''

559
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:31,802
Have a seat.
- PIease. - Thanks.

560
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,134
I guess you guys are on
the technicaI head.

561
00:26:34,206 --> 00:26:36,106
''Yeah, we heard about you.''

562
00:26:36,475 --> 00:26:39,467
''Pranay, I need your suggestion
on this cIient.''

563
00:26:39,544 --> 00:26:42,479
Sure.
- Sure. Why not?

564
00:26:43,248 --> 00:26:46,081
''I guess, I am busy right now.''

565
00:26:46,151 --> 00:26:47,413
Why don't we discuss
this during Iunch?

566
00:26:47,486 --> 00:26:50,353
Sure. Why not? Why don't
you join us for Iunch?

567
00:26:50,422 --> 00:26:51,480
Yeah. Sure.

568
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:53,547
He has to send a fax to
the OC immediateIy.

569
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:54,649
Okay.
- Me?

570
00:26:54,726 --> 00:26:56,250
''Yeah, Rochak. They need you to sign.''

571
00:26:56,328 --> 00:26:57,386
And you have to wait for an answer.

572
00:26:58,497 --> 00:27:00,624
Okay. Got it.

573
00:27:00,699 --> 00:27:02,564
''Okay. Let's go, Tanya.
- Yeah.''

574
00:27:02,634 --> 00:27:04,693
''So what kind of food
so you Iike, Tanya?''

575
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,762
''I Iove 'Biryani', spicy food and..
- Spicy food?''

576
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:11,502
Spicy chaats. You too.
- No. I just Iove..

577
00:27:11,576 --> 00:27:12,702
God bIess him.

578
00:27:13,378 --> 00:27:14,436
Okay.

579
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,411
''Tanya, Iet's have some Indian food.''

580
00:27:17,482 --> 00:27:20,645
Look! Look! Pranay is
taking Tanay for Iunch.

581
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:24,280
How these NRI guys entice girIs!

582
00:27:24,356 --> 00:27:26,722
''How, Laxmi?
- Prakash, you keep quiet!''

583
00:27:26,792 --> 00:27:28,555
''Laxmi, what did you see that day?''

584
00:27:28,627 --> 00:27:31,562
Oh God! Do you know what
happened that day?

585
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:34,531
Those NRI guys had removed
their cIothes..

586
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:36,123
..and do you know what
they were doing?

587
00:27:36,201 --> 00:27:37,395
I won't say it!

588
00:27:37,469 --> 00:27:39,596
''Laxmi, you are Iucky to
see a scene Iike that!''

589
00:27:39,671 --> 00:27:41,798
''Prakash, don't make a mockery of me!''

590
00:27:41,873 --> 00:27:43,807
Those guys are not Iike that.

591
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:47,072
No! I saw everything!
- What? You saw everything?

592
00:27:47,145 --> 00:27:49,443
You! - Wait! Wait! Don't fight!
Do you know what happened there?

593
00:27:49,514 --> 00:27:50,572
What?
- What?

594
00:27:50,649 --> 00:27:53,083
The garIands that
we had given them..

595
00:27:53,151 --> 00:27:54,209
..it was fuII of ants.

596
00:27:54,286 --> 00:27:56,083
And inside it bit them so
hard that they had to..

597
00:27:56,154 --> 00:27:57,485
..remove the cIothes
to get rid of it.

598
00:27:57,556 --> 00:28:00,081
Oh God!
- How did that happen?

599
00:28:04,229 --> 00:28:07,596
And he got it 2 days ago.
So it got fiIIed with ants.

600
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:09,258
And it bit them reaI hard.

601
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:11,632
Poor guys were scratching aII
the way to the oId city.

602
00:28:11,703 --> 00:28:13,534
Oh no!
- Poor guys!

603
00:28:13,672 --> 00:28:15,640
Very poor NRIs.

604
00:28:15,707 --> 00:28:19,108
''No, no! Don't say poor guys.
They are very smart.''

605
00:28:19,177 --> 00:28:20,576
I know NRIs very weII.

606
00:28:28,787 --> 00:28:31,483
You guys stay here. We wiII
handIe it upstairs.

607
00:28:31,556 --> 00:28:33,456
If the foreigners come running
downstairs then grab them.

608
00:28:33,525 --> 00:28:36,050
''Why did you get these guys? We
are sufficient, IsmaiI.''

609
00:28:36,128 --> 00:28:38,289
Come on! We wiII need them!
- Let's go inside. - Come.

610
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,761
It is a nice buiIding.
- Yes.

611
00:28:52,177 --> 00:28:55,078
''Such a big buiIding, boss.
How wiII we come to know?''

612
00:28:55,147 --> 00:28:57,479
''We wiII bang at aII the doors!
SaIim, you bang at this door.''

613
00:29:03,422 --> 00:29:06,186
''The sound of EngIish music is
coming from that door, boss.''

614
00:29:06,258 --> 00:29:08,556
I am sure that those foreigners
wiII be there. - Let's go.

615
00:29:14,566 --> 00:29:17,262
''Knock on the door.
- You do it, Kirak.''

616
00:29:26,678 --> 00:29:28,612
''Hey, what happened? What
are you guys Iooking at?''

617
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,444
You won't get any charity!
Not even a penny!

618
00:29:31,516 --> 00:29:34,178
Go! Go away from here!
Get Iost! What fooIs!

619
00:29:34,252 --> 00:29:36,277
''Boss, what did she say?''

620
00:29:36,354 --> 00:29:39,289
She says no charity. What
does she think of us?

621
00:29:40,358 --> 00:29:43,122
You Iook Iike the robber
who pickpockets..

622
00:29:43,195 --> 00:29:45,823
..other's waIIets in the bus.

623
00:29:45,897 --> 00:29:48,195
You Iook Iike an auto driver.

624
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:50,267
Why are you Iaughing?

625
00:29:50,335 --> 00:29:55,830
You Iook Iike the person who seIIs
new movie's tickets in bIack.

626
00:29:55,907 --> 00:29:57,135
And if you come with such
guys in this buiIding..

627
00:29:57,209 --> 00:30:00,736
..then peopIe are bound to think
that we have come for charity.

628
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:02,370
''SaIim, what do you Iook Iike?''

629
00:30:02,447 --> 00:30:05,280
Me? I Iook Iike the next hero
of Ramu's movie.

630
00:30:06,418 --> 00:30:09,148
Nowadays you have started
daydreaming. - Get Iost.

631
00:30:09,221 --> 00:30:11,212
Don't hit me! - Come on! We
have to find the foreigners!

632
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:13,154
Let's go! We
have to find the foreigners!

633
00:30:13,225 --> 00:30:14,749
She thinks we have come for charity!

634
00:30:14,826 --> 00:30:16,623
You guys have come to
find the foreigners!

635
00:30:16,695 --> 00:30:18,094
Then why are you both fighting
with each other!

636
00:30:18,163 --> 00:30:20,723
''FooIs! Come! - IsmaiI,
we wiII search upstairs.''

637
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,630
''Let's go!
- Boss, Iet's go.''

638
00:30:27,772 --> 00:30:31,230
One Chicken 'Biryani'.
One ChiIIi Chicken.

639
00:30:32,277 --> 00:30:35,769
One Butter Chicken. One
Chicken Manchurian.

640
00:30:36,114 --> 00:30:37,741
And 2 'Tandoori Roti'.

641
00:30:37,816 --> 00:30:40,512
''Less spicy.
- No, make it very spicy.''

642
00:30:40,585 --> 00:30:42,450
''Okay.
- Okay, ma'am.''

643
00:30:43,588 --> 00:30:46,751
''You know, Pranay. I Iove
spicy food. - Oh yeah.''

644
00:30:46,825 --> 00:30:49,521
And it must be nice for you to have
Indian food after a Iong time.

645
00:30:49,594 --> 00:30:50,754
Oh yeah! After a Iong time.

646
00:30:57,402 --> 00:31:00,735
It's nice and spicy. I Iove it.

647
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:16,144
Have some. Its reaIIy spicy and
you wiII Iove it. SeriousIy.

648
00:31:16,221 --> 00:31:17,779
Oh sure. Oh yeah. Thank you.

649
00:31:17,856 --> 00:31:20,518
Have some. Have some more.
- Thank you. Thank you.

650
00:31:27,832 --> 00:31:29,094
Pranya.
- Yeah.

651
00:31:29,167 --> 00:31:30,600
We were supposed to
discuss this cIient.

652
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:32,500
''Yeah, we wiII taIk about it,
once we finish the Iunch.''

653
00:31:32,571 --> 00:31:33,833
You know we can taIk
about the cIient.

654
00:31:33,905 --> 00:31:36,601
I hope you are enjoying it.
- Yeah. I am enjoying it.

655
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:44,740
''IsmaiI, just wait and watch.
I wiII open this door today.''

656
00:31:44,816 --> 00:31:48,183
Now it's my turn. Just Iook
how I open this door.

657
00:31:48,253 --> 00:31:55,125
Just Iook how I do it. See
it. Open it quickIy.

658
00:31:57,562 --> 00:32:01,054
Open it! Just wait and watch!

659
00:32:15,447 --> 00:32:17,244
''What happened, Jehangir?''

660
00:32:17,315 --> 00:32:20,284
I am a fooI.
- What happened to you?

661
00:32:20,352 --> 00:32:22,445
I taught him a Iesson!

662
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:27,822
You fooI! Let's go!
- Oh God! Oh God!

663
00:32:39,437 --> 00:32:42,600
''IsmaiI, Jehangir's

Those thieves! They
don't have any work!

680
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:08,623
They just raise chaos! ScoundreI!

681
00:34:10,395 --> 00:34:11,623

Where are you running! Stop!

684
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:22,766
Hey! Why are you hitting me? Leave!

685
00:34:23,408 --> 00:34:25,672
''What happened, IsmaiI?
- Nothing. Let's go.''

686
00:34:30,181 --> 00:34:31,409
They ran away.

687
00:34:31,483 --> 00:34:33,348
''I wiII teach them a Iesson,
if they came again.''

688
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:35,079
They ran away when they saw me!

689
00:34:35,153 --> 00:34:36,347
Boss!

690
00:34:39,157 --> 00:34:41,489
Today I have cooked the dinner.

691
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:43,083
That too in Hydrabadi styIe.

692
00:34:43,161 --> 00:34:45,095
Eat. Eat to your heart's content.

693
00:34:45,163 --> 00:34:46,221
Food!

694
00:34:47,732 --> 00:34:50,826
So how was your Iunch
today with Tanya?

695
00:34:50,902 --> 00:34:52,597
It was great! I had a good time!

696
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:56,265
So.. you couId handIe spicy food?

697
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:57,831
What do you think? I can eat a Iot.

698
00:35:00,445 --> 00:35:02,037
What happened?

699
00:35:05,784 --> 00:35:08,252
I knew you can take spicy food.

700
00:35:09,053 --> 00:35:10,680
Oh no!
- Brother.

701
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:19,124
Oh no! Spicy!

702
00:35:45,256 --> 00:35:48,350
''Brother, what happened?
What happened?''

703
00:35:48,426 --> 00:35:50,690
What did you put in this food?
What did you put?

704
00:35:50,762 --> 00:35:53,595
''Nothing, brother. 1 kg mutton.
1 kg chiIIy.''

705
00:35:53,665 --> 00:35:58,102
In 1 kg mutton and1
kg chiIIy.. PAU kg..

706
00:35:58,169 --> 00:36:00,296
I am confused. I had
put so much chiIIy.

707
00:36:00,371 --> 00:36:02,236
Okay! No cooking! You
don't cook again!

708
00:36:02,307 --> 00:36:06,038
Forget it! Get it from outside.
Get it from outside.

709
00:36:07,245 --> 00:36:09,543
''Brother, shouId I get 'Biryani'?''

710
00:36:09,614 --> 00:36:13,243
Get some 'Biryani'. But not spicy.
Get some buttermiIk too.

711
00:36:13,318 --> 00:36:16,344
How much? - 1 'Biryani'
is onIy for 500 rupees.

712
00:36:16,855 --> 00:36:18,720
''1 ,2,3''

713
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:23,386
''No, no, brother. 1 , 2,

714
00:36:30,134 --> 00:36:32,534
''Get some buttermiIk too.
- Okay, okay, brother.''

715
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,474
FooIs! 'Biryani'! 'Biryani'!

716
00:36:51,256 --> 00:36:53,156
''Come on, AIIaya. Hurry up.''

717
00:36:53,224 --> 00:36:55,158
''Okay, ma'am. Just 2 minutes.''

718
00:37:03,034 --> 00:37:04,467
''Hi, Tanya.
- Hi, Rochak.''

719
00:37:06,204 --> 00:37:07,398
Are the figures ready?

720
00:37:07,472 --> 00:37:09,372
''Yeah, I am done with it.
Take a Iook at it.''

721
00:37:15,046 --> 00:37:16,445
''Hi, SheetaI.

722
00:37:16,514 --> 00:37:18,311
''How are you?
- I am fine. Hi, guys.''

723
00:37:18,383 --> 00:37:20,374
''Hi, SheetaI.
- Have a seat. - Hi, SheetaI. - Hi.''

724
00:37:20,451 --> 00:37:22,442
You said 3 days and you
disappeared for a week.

725
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,114
TeII me. How was your
marriage proposaI?

726
00:37:25,189 --> 00:37:28,056
What do I teII you? The
guy was a bit short.

727
00:37:28,126 --> 00:37:30,526
Yeah. She wants onIy taII guys.

728
00:37:30,595 --> 00:37:33,223
''Hey, do you know about the
sensationaI topic in the office?''

729
00:37:33,298 --> 00:37:35,266
What? What? What happened?

730
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:38,530
You know Raju's friends NRIs
have joined the company.

731
00:37:38,603 --> 00:37:40,366
''Yeah?
- They are so handsome, you know''

732
00:37:40,438 --> 00:37:43,601
You guys don't get stuck
with those NRIs.

733
00:37:43,675 --> 00:37:46,143
''SheetaI, you pIease stay away.''

734
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,178
You know what happened
when they came?

735
00:37:48,246 --> 00:37:49,338
What happened?
- What happened? What happened?

736
00:37:49,414 --> 00:37:50,540
''You keep quiet, Prakash!''

737
00:37:50,615 --> 00:37:52,708
Laxmi went in and saw everything.

738
00:37:52,784 --> 00:37:54,081
What did she see?

739
00:37:54,152 --> 00:37:56,586
''What, Laxmi?
- Nothing.''

740
00:37:56,654 --> 00:38:01,023
I went inside for some work.
And I saw something inside.

741
00:38:01,092 --> 00:38:02,457
What's my fauIt in this?

742
00:38:03,294 --> 00:38:09,392
''And SheetaI, you stay away
from these NRI guys. - Why?''

743
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:13,062
You know Pranay took Tanya for
Iunch. You know! - Is that so?

744
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,466
It was so funny!

745
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,031
And at that time when
I was so scared..

746
00:38:18,109 --> 00:38:21,044
..I was running Iike heII from
that pIace. It was so funny!

747
00:38:23,381 --> 00:38:24,575
''Oh no, man!''

748
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:28,278
''Hi, Pranay.
- Hi. - Hey.''

749
00:38:28,353 --> 00:38:29,684
Come on. Why don't you join in?

750
00:38:29,754 --> 00:38:31,051
What's going on?

751
00:38:31,122 --> 00:38:33,113
Rochak was teIIing me about
the New York joke.

752
00:38:33,191 --> 00:38:36,388
That was a Iong time ago.
- But it's so funny!

753
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:38,656
''Okay! Okay! Tanya, are you
joining me for Iunch?''

754
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:41,290
Why don't you join us?
- Oh sure.

755
00:38:41,366 --> 00:38:44,563
''No, actuaIIy Rajeev wants
to have Iunch with you.''

756
00:38:44,636 --> 00:38:46,365
He wants to discuss some work.

757
00:38:46,437 --> 00:38:48,735
''He didn't teII me.
- No, he toId me to teII you.''

758
00:38:50,074 --> 00:38:51,803
Okay. Let's go.
- Yeah. Let's go.

759
00:38:51,876 --> 00:38:53,468
''See you, Pranay. Bye.''

760
00:38:54,078 --> 00:38:56,376
''So what kind of food
you Iike, Tanya?''

761
00:38:57,081 --> 00:38:58,776
How about some spicy food?

762
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:00,078
''Oh no, Rochak!''

763
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:01,482
I Iike spicy food.

764
00:39:01,552 --> 00:39:04,077
''Yeah, me too. You want to
try some today? - Why not?''

765
00:39:04,155 --> 00:39:07,488
Look! Look! Tanya is going
for Iunch with Rochak.

766
00:39:07,558 --> 00:39:09,719
She went with Pranay yesterday.

767
00:39:09,794 --> 00:39:12,092
''Today she is going with Rochak.
I toId you, didn't I?''

768
00:39:12,163 --> 00:39:14,495
''Okay, I wiII come with you.
- Keep quiet!''

769
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:18,168
''Laxmi, so what if she
has gone for Iunch?''

770
00:39:18,236 --> 00:39:20,101
Nowadays everything is fine.

771
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,208
''IsmaiI, greetings.''

772
00:39:25,276 --> 00:39:28,336
I have found the whereabouts
of the foreigner's office.

773
00:39:28,413 --> 00:39:31,177
''What?
- Yes. Greetings, IsmaiI.''

774
00:39:31,249 --> 00:39:34,446
''IsmaiI, I have found the whereabouts
of the foreigner's office. TeII him!''

775
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:38,285
We searched everywhere. Those
wide and narrow Ianes.

776
00:39:38,356 --> 00:39:40,381
''We searched everywhere, boss.''

777
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:42,722
Now we wiII go and bash the
foreigners bIack and bIue.

778
00:39:42,794 --> 00:39:46,127
Keep quiet! Look at him!
He got bashed!

779
00:39:46,197 --> 00:39:47,858
Look at the face of
this auto driver!

780
00:39:47,932 --> 00:39:52,733
You guys have compIeteIy
tarnished my image!

781
00:39:53,204 --> 00:39:55,331
''IsmaiI, we made
a mistake there.''

782
00:39:55,406 --> 00:39:56,464
Now do you want to take revenge
from the foreigners?

783
00:39:56,541 --> 00:39:57,599
Yes.

784
00:39:57,675 --> 00:39:58,733
I have found their office address.

785
00:39:58,876 --> 00:40:00,138
Now wiII fuII pIanning..

786
00:40:01,813 --> 00:40:03,474
''Boss, he is great fIatterer.''

787
00:40:03,748 --> 00:40:05,807
He can do anything for
haIf a cup of tea.

788
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:07,408
Day before yesterday he took
us to the apartment..

789
00:40:07,485 --> 00:40:08,543
..and made us paupers.

790
00:40:08,686 --> 00:40:10,677
Now he is taking to the office.
Now what wiII he do?

791
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:12,488
Now my pIan is not going to faiI.

792
00:40:13,224 --> 00:40:14,748
''IsmaiI, your respect
is my respect.''

793
00:40:15,226 --> 00:40:18,286
''SaIim, this time the foreigners
shouIdn't escape.''

794
00:40:19,297 --> 00:40:21,629
''I made a bIunder then. Boss,
now just wait and watch.''

795
00:40:21,899 --> 00:40:24,094
''We have roamed a Iot. Boss,
we are hungry.''

796
00:40:24,502 --> 00:40:26,436
You are aIways hungry!

797
00:40:26,504 --> 00:40:27,835
On the way too you were saying
that you are hungry!

798
00:40:28,306 --> 00:40:29,364
Eat whatever you want!

799
00:40:29,574 --> 00:40:31,701
Bring a gIass of miIk and get
whatever you have cooked.

800
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,441
Do you think that IsmaiI
is a pauper?

801
00:40:33,644 --> 00:40:35,373
Has he ever stopped us?
Did he say anything?

802
00:40:35,446 --> 00:40:36,504
Did he hesitate to spend?

803
00:40:36,848 --> 00:40:40,511
''You guys want to have tea,
cigarette and food for free.''

804
00:40:40,718 --> 00:40:42,583
So you are fIattering me!

805
00:40:43,321 --> 00:40:45,448
''Give us just one chance!
- Just one chance, IsmaiI.''

806
00:40:49,393 --> 00:40:51,793
Where are you going?
- To Pranay's cabin.

807
00:40:52,263 --> 00:40:56,791
SheetaI.. be carefuI.
Come soon. Okay.

808
00:40:57,401 --> 00:40:59,392
''Come on, Laxmi. SheetaI, you go.''

809
00:41:00,271 --> 00:41:03,729
''Laxmi, she is going to
a murderous psychopath!''

810
00:41:04,142 --> 00:41:05,803
Why do you take everything
so seriousIy?

811
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:08,405
No! No! I am not serious.

812
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,344
''Don't say that too. Laxmi, you
have got a caII for you.''

813
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:16,480
''Okay. HeIIo, who is this?''

814
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,486
Who is it?
- What is this?

815
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:28,830
I don't understand. Give it to me.

816
00:41:38,776 --> 00:41:41,176
''Prakash, you idiot!''

817
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:43,570
''Okay, mom! I wiII take care!
- How is Rammy?''

818
00:41:43,648 --> 00:41:47,175
''Yeah, he is fine. He is
doing good, mom. Yeah.''

819
00:41:52,323 --> 00:41:54,518
Wow! BeautifuI!
- What! What!

820
00:41:54,725 --> 00:41:56,386
''Nothing! Nothing, mom!
I have to go! Bye.''

821
00:41:58,196 --> 00:42:00,130
''She is SheetaI.
- Hey, dude. What's up?''

822
00:42:00,264 --> 00:42:03,199
That's SheetaI. She had taken a
Iong Ieave. She is back today.

823
00:42:03,267 --> 00:42:04,666
''Okay.
- Anyway, had your Iunch?''

824
00:42:05,102 --> 00:42:06,592
''No, Rochak said that you want
to have Iunch with me.''

825
00:42:06,671 --> 00:42:07,729
And taIk something important.

826
00:42:08,072 --> 00:42:10,131
Where's Rochak?
- He has gone out for Iunch.

827
00:42:10,474 --> 00:42:12,135
With Tanya?
- Yeah.

828
00:42:13,077 --> 00:42:14,408

00:52:08,138 --> 00:52:10,197
''Yes, Anna.
- Today is our festivaI.''

997
00:52:10,274 --> 00:52:12,469
''No, Anna. Just come for an hour.''

998
00:52:12,609 --> 00:52:14,474
What are you saying! Disconnect

999
00:52:14,611 --> 00:52:15,669
Listen to what I am saying!

1000
00:52:15,746 --> 00:52:16,804

00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,741
''Anna, pIease Iisten to me.

1002
00:52:22,152 --> 00:52:24,211
''Jessie, okay. Take care. Bye.''

1003
00:52:28,692 --> 00:52:30,751
It was so funny! It was crazy!

1004
00:52:32,162 --> 00:52:34,096
And Pranay had such
a bad stomach upset.

1005
00:52:34,498 --> 00:52:36,227
He was sitting in the bathroom
the whoIe night.

1006
00:52:41,104 --> 00:52:42,366
''Hey, guys. What's going on?''

1007
00:52:42,439 --> 00:52:44,703
Hey! These pretty Iadies were just..

1008
00:52:44,775 --> 00:52:46,367
..asking about experience
in Hydrabad.

1009
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:49,645
Oh wonderfuI experiences! BeautifuI
girIs! I mean pIaces.

1010
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,238
And good 'Biryani'.

1011
00:52:51,715 --> 00:52:53,706
ReaI spicy food.
- No spicy food.

1012
00:52:54,384 --> 00:52:56,784
''Hey, spicy food is good. I
Iike spicy food. - Yeah.''

1013
00:52:56,854 --> 00:52:58,845
''Hey, we heard that you
had a bad stomach.''

1014
00:52:59,456 --> 00:53:01,048
And you were sitting aII
night in the bathroom.

1015
00:53:01,658 --> 00:53:03,455
''Yeah, in the bathroom.
Who toId you this?''

1016
00:53:03,727 --> 00:53:04,785
He did!
- He did!

1017
00:53:04,862 --> 00:53:06,329
''Yeah, he takes care of me a Iot!''

1018
00:53:07,698 --> 00:53:10,394
''Yeah, I remember there were some
oId city guys. Who are they?''

1019
00:53:11,201 --> 00:53:13,066
They were asking for the
foreigners. Who were they?

1020
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:15,131
''Yeah, they were so rude!''

1021
00:53:15,672 --> 00:53:17,469
''They came with buckets, broomsticks!''

1022
00:53:18,075 --> 00:53:19,542
I guess they wanted to beat them.

1023
00:53:21,078 --> 00:53:23,740
ActuaIIy they came for the 3rd
fIoor. For some foreigners.

1024
00:53:24,281 --> 00:53:25,339
They wanted to beat them.

1025
00:53:25,816 --> 00:53:28,080
Somebody said that they
came for you peopIe.

1026
00:53:28,151 --> 00:53:29,812
No way! They can't mess with us!

1027
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:32,347
''If they do, we are going
to beat them reaI bad!''

1028
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:35,820
Rip their fIesh out! Chop
them into IittIe pieces!

1029
00:53:35,893 --> 00:53:37,087
CooI! CooI!

1030
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,286
''Hey, easy Pranay. Okay. CooI it.''

1031
00:53:38,362 --> 00:53:39,488
No way. They can't come here.

1032
00:53:39,763 --> 00:53:40,821
It's okay.
- Yeah.

1033
00:53:41,698 --> 00:53:43,563
He is a IittIe emotionaI. Okay.

1034
00:53:44,101 --> 00:53:45,432
You guys don't worry. I am there.

1035

1036
00:53:56,847 --> 00:53:58,178
''Yeah, I caIIed for you, SheetaI.''

1037
00:53:58,448 --> 00:54:01,246
3 more companies are joining
our customer care service.

1038
00:54:01,318 --> 00:54:02,376
Okay! Great!

1039
00:54:02,452 --> 00:54:06,718
''Yeah! Those are Masis, Johnsons,
FireIines.''

1040
00:54:07,591 --> 00:54:09,650
Do you Iike 'Biryani'?

1041
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:13,058

1042
00:54:13,196 --> 00:54:15,664
''Yeah, vegetarian 'Biryani'.
I am a vegetarian.''

1043
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:18,531
Oh! Vegetarian! I Iove vegetarian!

1044
00:54:18,802 --> 00:54:20,064
Vegetarian is good!

1045
00:54:21,805 --> 00:54:23,204
What the heII are you doing there?
- What?

1046
00:54:23,407 --> 00:54:24,806
I caIIed twice in the
meeting for you.

1047
00:54:24,875 --> 00:54:26,069
I wiII be there in a minute!

1048
00:54:26,743 --> 00:54:28,802
This Rochak.. he wants my
suggestion aII the time.

1049
00:54:29,546 --> 00:54:31,138
He just can't work without me.

1050
00:54:31,615 --> 00:54:32,673
''Yeah, SheetaI.''

1051
00:54:32,749 --> 00:54:34,273
Why don't we go out and have
some vegetarian food?

1052
00:54:34,618 --> 00:54:36,552
''No, actuaIIy me, Preeti

1053
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:37,678
..we brought food from home.

00:54:37,754 --> 00:54:38,812
So..
- Come on.

1055
00:54:38,889 --> 00:54:40,356
You can show us some new
joints in Hydrabad.

1056
00:54:40,824 --> 00:54:43,418
Okay. Some other time.
- Okay. Thanks.

1057
00:54:43,827 --> 00:54:45,624
''Okay, see you.
- Okay. Bye.''

1058
00:54:52,769 --> 00:54:54,168
What happened? What happened?
Why did he caII you?

1059
00:54:54,705 --> 00:54:56,570
Do you think he actuaIIy caIIed
me to taIk about work?

1060
00:54:57,107 --> 00:54:58,165
So what for?

1061
00:54:58,575 --> 00:55:00,509
He indirectIy wanted to
ask me out for Iunch.

1062
00:55:01,111 --> 00:55:02,703
What? Then what did you say?

1063
00:55:03,513 --> 00:55:06,710
I said I wiII think about it.
What eIse couId I have said.

1064
00:55:07,517 --> 00:55:09,246
You are a mad girI. You shouId
have gone with him.

1065
00:55:09,453 --> 00:55:11,250
What wouId have happened?
- Next time.

1066
00:55:11,788 --> 00:55:13,585
Yes! Yes! I was Iistening
to everything.

1067
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:15,052
What was I saying that day?

1068
00:55:15,392 --> 00:55:18,054
This is what they say when they
want to take you out for Iunch.

1069
00:55:18,395 --> 00:55:21,592
AII NRI guys are the same.
I know everything.

1070
00:55:22,132 --> 00:55:23,599
''Come on, Laxmi!
- Come on, Laxmi!''

1071
00:55:24,067 --> 00:55:26,467
How much shouId I warn you guys!

1072
00:55:27,738 --> 00:55:28,796
Smarty!

1073
00:55:35,345 --> 00:55:38,610
Where is that Ramesh?
- He has stiII not come.

1074
00:55:39,216 --> 00:55:40,274
He thinks I have no work to do?

1075
00:55:43,086 --> 00:55:45,680
Let him come. I wiII show him.

1076
00:55:49,426 --> 00:55:52,418
''Greetings, Anna.
- What is it?''

1077
00:55:53,096 --> 00:55:54,427
America! America!

1078
00:55:55,098 --> 00:55:57,089
Where were you? You think
we don't have any work!

1079
00:55:57,434 --> 00:55:59,629
''No, Anna. Forgive me. I
had gone for some work.''

1080
00:55:59,703 --> 00:56:00,692
What work?

1081
00:56:03,173 --> 00:56:04,231
What?

1082
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:07,036
''That, Anna. That!
- What?''

1083
00:56:08,045 --> 00:56:11,446
Kidnap.
- Kidnap whom?

1084
00:56:12,382 --> 00:56:16,182
My cousin. He has come from
America. He is very weaIthy.

1085
00:56:17,054 --> 00:56:18,112
How much wiII we get?

1086
00:56:18,455 --> 00:56:19,513
If we kidnap him and caII America..

1087
00:56:19,589 --> 00:56:25,050
..then we wiII get
5 Iakhs in doIIars.

1088
00:56:25,262 --> 00:56:26,593
1 for you. 4 for me.

1089
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:29,264
''What do you think of me!
- Take one more, Anna.''

1090
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:31,065
''If you want to divide it equaIIy,
then teII me.''

1091
00:56:31,268 --> 00:56:32,599
''Anna, why are you getting
so infuriated?''

1092
00:56:32,803 --> 00:56:34,270
Hey! You are trying to act smart!

1093
00:56:35,072 --> 00:56:37,267
''Anna, reduce it a bit.
- I wiII bash you.''

1094
00:56:37,674 --> 00:56:39,266
We wiII share it.
- Keep quiet!

1095
00:56:39,743 --> 00:56:42,075
''Fine, Anna. We wiII do
it 50-50. Take this.''

1096
00:56:42,813 --> 00:56:46,408
''Anna, tomorrow I wiII
bring him in the auto.''

1097
00:56:47,084 --> 00:56:50,679
Give me 100 rupees. - Do you think
that I am a fooI! Get Iost!

1098
00:56:50,754 --> 00:56:51,812
Cheena!
- Cheena!

1099
00:56:52,089 --> 00:56:53,147
ExpIain it to him.

1100
00:56:53,557 --> 00:56:55,218
''Hey, Ramesh. Come here.''

1101
00:56:55,292 --> 00:56:56,691
Your boss's time is very bad.

1102
00:57:01,975 --> 00:57:03,499
This is the man whom
we have to kidnap.

1103
00:57:04,377 --> 00:57:05,435
Look at him properIy.

1104
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:10,240
800 for you. 800 for
you. 700 for you.

1105
00:57:10,784 --> 00:57:12,046
I wiII decide your rates Iater.

1106
00:57:12,519 --> 00:57:13,781
''Anna, 700 rupees is not enough.''

1107
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,512
There they are taking 2 Iakhs.

1108
00:57:15,589 --> 00:57:17,386
And you are giving 700 rupees.
What is this?

1109
00:57:17,858 --> 00:57:19,450
What I do is none of your business.

1110
00:57:19,526 --> 00:57:22,256
''If you want to work, then
come. Otherwise go.''

1111
00:57:23,063 --> 00:57:24,121
What fooIs I have got!

1112
00:57:25,398 --> 00:57:28,060
He didn't even give 100 rupees.
Now what wiII he give?

1113
00:57:29,936 --> 00:57:31,369
''IsmaiI, I want a cigarette.
- Take it.''

1114
00:57:31,938 --> 00:57:37,342
''Listen, 4 Manikchand, 4 Sweetie,
2 packets Iarge GoId FIake.. ''

1115
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:39,344
..2 packets smaII GoId FIake. One..

1116
00:57:39,412 --> 00:57:40,538
Do you want to buy the whoIe shop?

1117
00:57:40,614 --> 00:57:42,013
Buy 2 cigarettes and Iet's go.

1118
00:57:44,284 --> 00:57:45,342
Money.

1119
00:57:45,485 --> 00:57:47,476
When the jeep broke down in
the jungIe in the night..

1120
00:57:47,554 --> 00:57:49,146
..4 Iions surrounded my father.

1121
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:53,884
My father too took out the gun.
He shot and kiIIed one Iion.

1122
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,422
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1123
00:57:56,963 --> 00:57:58,021
''Jehangir, how are you?''

1124
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,965
HeIIo. Who?

1125
00:58:02,969 --> 00:58:05,096
IsmaiI? Who IsmaiI?

1126
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:08,098
IsmaiI. One minute. One minute.

1127
00:58:08,909 --> 00:58:10,774
Sister-in-Iaw's caII.
The second sister-in-Iaw.

1128
00:58:11,111 --> 00:58:12,510
How did you get the phone?

1129
00:58:13,046 --> 00:58:14,104
That day when we were
cIeaning the bathroom..

1130
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:15,238
..it got mispIaced.

1131
00:58:15,315 --> 00:58:16,976
Lower your voice! She wiII hear it!

1132
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:21,180
You guys have tarnished
my image! FooIs!

1133
00:58:21,254 --> 00:58:23,119
I wiII be there within an hour.

1134
00:58:25,392 --> 00:58:29,328
You guys have sIandered
my image! FooIs!

1135
00:58:29,529 --> 00:58:30,928
I have facing so many probIems.

1136
00:58:32,465 --> 00:58:35,127
''IsmaiI, order 2 cups of tea.
- No tea!''

1137
00:58:35,535 --> 00:58:36,797
''Fine, IsmaiI.''

1138
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:39,805
''Even if you won't give us tea,
stiII we wiII respect you.''

1139
00:58:40,073 --> 00:58:41,335
Since chiIdhood I have
been observing.

1140
00:58:41,808 --> 00:58:44,276
IsmaiI has been staying at
Char Minar for the past 25 years.

1141
00:58:44,544 --> 00:58:46,535
PeopIe caII him brave IsmaiI.

1142
00:58:46,947 --> 00:58:48,938
When I couIdn't pay
the schooI fees..

1143
00:58:49,015 --> 00:58:50,812
..then IsmaiI used
to give me the money.

1144
00:58:51,151 --> 00:58:52,812
IsmaiI did so
many things for us.

1145
00:58:53,019 --> 00:58:55,954
''If we don't see him for 2 days,
peopIe ask where is IsmaiI?''

1146
00:58:56,022 --> 00:58:57,080
Has he gone to Dubai?

1147
00:58:57,357 --> 00:58:58,824
Day before yesterday KhaIera
caIIed me..

1148
00:58:58,892 --> 00:59:00,883
..to ask when is IsmaiI
coming to Dubai.

1149
00:59:01,361 --> 00:59:03,022
Day before yesterday I was
passing by the market.

1150
00:59:03,296 --> 00:59:04,820
I saw Ruksana.
- Okay.

1151
00:59:04,898 --> 00:59:05,956
The same beautifuI face.

1152
00:59:06,099 --> 00:59:08,966
''She was asking me. SaIim,
where is IsmaiI?''

1153
00:59:09,035 --> 00:59:10,161
Is everything fine?

1154
00:59:10,437 --> 00:59:12,564
I toId him why are you asking
whether everything is fine?

1155
00:59:12,973 --> 00:59:14,167
Do you know what she said?

1156
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,901
I am asking because I was worried.

1157
00:59:16,109 --> 00:59:17,838
You see IsmaiI was bashed.

1158
00:59:17,911 --> 00:59:19,242
Now Ruksana aIso knows.

1159
00:59:19,846 --> 00:59:23,373
''Bhai, don't be tense. I
have pIotted a nice pIan.''

1160
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:25,181
The foreigners won't escape.

1161
00:59:25,585 --> 00:59:26,916
''Fine, order for 2 cups of tea.''

1162

''Yeah, I was taIking to SheetaI

00:59:43,203 --> 00:59:44,261
Its okay. Forget it.

1169
00:59:44,537 --> 00:59:47,062
There is onIy one way to keep
the oId city guys away from us.

1170
00:59:47,607 --> 00:59:49,939
Oh no! Oh no! We can't kiII them!

00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:51,136
We are not kiIIing them. - So what
are you doing with the gun?

1172
00:59:51,411 --> 00:59:54,278
Listen carefuIIy. Whenever the
oId city guys come to you..

1173
00:59:54,347 --> 00:59:56,338
..sIowIy take out the gun
and show it to them.

1174
00:59:56,616 --> 00:59:57,878
Pretend that you have a gun.

1175
00:59:58,351 --> 00:59:59,943
CIean it and keep it
back in the pocket.

1176
01:00:00,286 --> 01:00:01,548
They wiII be scared and
they won't come to you.

1177
01:00:02,155 --> 01:00:04,885
So you cIean the gun and they
get scared and waIk away?

1178
01:00:05,425 --> 01:00:07,086
We are not cIeaning the gun.

1179
01:00:07,961 --> 01:00:09,019
We are showing them
that we have a gun.

1180
01:00:09,095 --> 01:00:10,187

1183
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,829
''No, I'II have the gun.

1184
01:00:16,169 --> 01:00:18,967
Okay! You peopIe can keep
the gun each one day.

1185
01:00:19,305 --> 01:00:20,363
How about you?

01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:02,015

''I had toId you, SheetaI. First

You didn't go. Now he has
caIIed another girI.

1200
01:01:10,567 --> 01:01:13,832
These NRI guys are aII the same.

01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:18,368
''Lotus, you are not supposed
to come here.''

1202
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:20,370
Why? What happened?

1203
01:01:20,577 --> 01:01:21,908

is company ruIes..

1204

Okay! Okay! Now I understand.

My dhoti! Oh no! Oh no!

Hydrabad is so beautifuI! And

01:22:22,838 --> 01:22:24,703
SheetaI is the very hard working
girI in our company.

1489
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,774
She is very discipIined
and traditionaI girI.

1490
01:22:26,842 --> 01:22:28,434
I aIways teII my mom about SheetaI.

1491
01:22:28,643 --> 01:22:30,975
So I came here to teII you that
I am interested in SheetaI.

1492
01:22:31,379 --> 01:22:32,437
And I want to marry her.

1493
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:34,778
''WeII, my mom and dad are
doctors in the US.''

1494
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:38,318
And I am a MBA graduate. So I
thought I wiII teII you first.

1495
01:22:38,653 --> 01:22:40,848
ActuaIIy we don't know
anything about this.

1496
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:44,322
First we wiII taIk to SheetaI.
And then we wiII Iet you know.

1497
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:45,723
Oh sure. Okay.
- Okay.

1498
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:47,455
I wiII see you Iater. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1499
01:22:47,529 --> 01:22:48,723
Greetings. Greetings.

1500
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:55,794
TeII it cIearIy. Later on there
shouIdn't be any probIem.

1501
01:22:55,871 --> 01:22:58,533
Do everything properIy. Understand?

1502
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:00,465
''Greetings, Anna.''

1503
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:02,339
''Ramesh, what is this?''

1504
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:03,877
''Anna, Iower your voice.
Otherwise he wiII hear.''

1505
01:23:04,412 --> 01:23:05,674
He won't understand.

1506
01:23:06,414 --> 01:23:08,348
''Anna, you got brother Pranay.''

1507
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:10,841
''Instead of Pranay,
we have got Rochak!''

1508
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:13,350
The pIan is sabotaged!

1509
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:15,347
I toId you to keep the door open.

1510
01:23:15,423 --> 01:23:16,617
And you were drunk and asIeep!

1511
01:23:17,425 --> 01:23:18,756
Now what to do with him?

1512
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:20,954
''Anna, why do you worry?''

1513
01:23:21,429 --> 01:23:25,365
''He and Pranay, together we wiII
get 10 Iakhs from America.''

1514
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:31,635
He is none other than your Ramesh.

1515
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:35,639
Oh no! It's Ramesh's pIan!

1516
01:23:36,711 --> 01:23:39,646
I can't beIieve it! Oh no!

1517
01:23:45,587 --> 01:23:46,713
Oh no!

1518
01:23:53,395 --> 01:23:54,589
It sucks!

1519
01:23:54,663 --> 01:23:56,324
What happened? It's not good?

1520
01:23:56,665 --> 01:23:58,656
''Sorry, there is no money.''

1521
01:23:58,733 --> 01:24:00,462
That's why I have got cheap food.

1522
01:24:00,669 --> 01:24:05,800
''Americans eats 'Biryani',
ice cream, pizza, coke.''

1523
01:24:06,408 --> 01:24:07,807
From where wiII we get such stuff?

1524
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:11,345
Open it! Open it!

1525
01:24:16,851 --> 01:24:19,012
''SaIim, what is happening inside?''

1526
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:21,355
I know what is going on.

1527
01:24:21,690 --> 01:24:25,353
IsmaiI-bhai is venting out the
foreigners anger on bhabhi.

1528
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:30,297
You have to do this.
To controI your wife.

1529
01:24:30,632 --> 01:24:31,963
IsmaiI-bhai!

1530
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:35,427
''Greetings, boss.''

1531
01:24:35,503 --> 01:24:36,561
Greetings.

1532
01:24:36,638 --> 01:24:37,696
What happened?

1533
01:24:37,772 --> 01:24:39,296
I toId you guys not
to come in the house.

1534
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:41,307
What is this?

1535
01:24:41,376 --> 01:24:44,311
''IsmaiI-bhai, Jegangir was asking
what is going on inside.''

1536
01:24:44,379 --> 01:24:46,313
TeII him.
- What do you guys think?

1537
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:47,439
I was thrashing inside.

1538
01:24:47,515 --> 01:24:48,573
What do you guys know?

1539
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:49,776
''If you wiII marry, then
you wiII come to know.''

1540
01:24:49,851 --> 01:24:51,318
You guys go. I wiII
meet you aII there.

1541
01:24:54,723 --> 01:24:57,920
Now I came to know who
is bashing whom.

1542
01:24:58,393 --> 01:24:59,792
''SaIim, you too get married.''

1543
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:02,455
Then you too wiII come
to know how to bash.

1544
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:05,328
Go away! What are you teIIing
me! I am not IsmaiI-bhai!

1545
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:14,466
Look! Look! Come here!

1546
01:25:14,676 --> 01:25:16,940
I wiII give you this
ring! Let me go.

1547
01:25:17,412 --> 01:25:19,346
What ring? I can't understand.

1548
01:25:19,414 --> 01:25:21,882
This ring. GoId. GoId ring.

1549
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:23,474
''No, if they wiII see then
they wiII bash me.''

1550
01:25:24,853 --> 01:25:28,345
5000.
- What? 5 Iakhs.

1551
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:35,357
''No, no. 5000. 5000. Come on,
man. Take it. Take it.''

1552
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:36,761
I don't understand.

1553
01:25:36,831 --> 01:25:38,890
''Its pure goId. Take it, man.''

1554
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:42,630
Smarty.

1555
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:48,839
''Hey! Hey, that's it!
Come on! Come on!''

1556
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:50,901
Come on! Easy! Easy! Easy!

1557
01:25:51,446 --> 01:25:53,641
Take it! Take it!
Let's go! Let's go!

1558
01:25:53,715 --> 01:25:56,377
Fast! Fast!
- Hurry up! Hurry up!

1559
01:25:56,451 --> 01:25:58,385
Come on! Let's go!
- Come.

1560
01:25:58,453 --> 01:25:59,852
Come. Hurry up. Don't make noise.

1561
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:01,047
Hurry up.

1562
01:26:02,457 --> 01:26:04,391
CarefuIIy! See where
you are going! Bye!

1563
01:26:04,459 --> 01:26:05,517
See where you are going!

1564
01:26:05,593 --> 01:26:13,932
Bye-bye!
- See you! Bye!

1565
01:26:17,806 --> 01:26:19,603
Anna! He ran away!

1566
01:26:19,741 --> 01:26:21,800
Anna! He ran away! Anna!

1567
01:26:21,876 --> 01:26:23,605
What happened? What happened?

1568
01:26:23,678 --> 01:26:24,736
Anna! He ran away!

1569
01:26:24,813 --> 01:26:25,802
How did he run away?

1570
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:27,347
I took him to the bathroom..

1571
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:32,551
''And he untied the rope. Anna,
I was Iooking here.''

1572
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:34,019
You shouId have toId us before.

1573
01:26:34,422 --> 01:26:35,480
You shouId have toId us before.

1574
01:26:35,557 --> 01:26:36,888
I made a mistake.

1575
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:38,550
Go! Go and find him!

1576
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,625
How did he Iet him go!

1577
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:44,893
Go! Nab him! What are
you aII doing! Go!

1578
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:47,560
Anna! - Where did he run away!
Where did he run away!

1579
01:26:47,635 --> 01:26:49,432
You shouId have said before!

1580
01:26:53,775 --> 01:26:54,833
HeIIo.

1581
01:26:54,909 --> 01:26:56,376
''Ramesh.
- Yes, Anna.''

1582
01:26:56,444 --> 01:26:58,378
That foreigner ran away.
He must be coming there.

1583
01:26:58,446 --> 01:27:01,381
''Anna, I am in troubIe.
They wiII kiII me.''

1584
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:03,383
Keep quiet! Nothing
wiII happen to you!

1585
01:27:03,451 --> 01:27:07,911
He doesn't know anything!
Behave normaIIy.

1586
01:27:08,456 --> 01:27:09,718
''Okay, Anna. Okay.''

1587
01:27:09,791 --> 01:27:11,986
How did he run away?

1588
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:14,394
Smarty!

1589
01:27:19,467 --> 01:27:20,934
I was taIking to them very poIiteIy.

1590
01:27:23,471 --> 01:27:24,938
So what did SheetaI's parents say?

1591
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:26,998
They said they wiII taIk to
SheetaI and Iet me know.

1592
01:27:27,408 --> 01:27:29,342
That's good. That's a
positive sign. - Is it?

1593
01:27:29,677 --> 01:27:31,611
You don't worry. Everything
wiII be aII right.

1594
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:32,805
Do you think it wiII work out?

1595
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:35,473
Sure. It wiII work out.
Look at Rochak.

1596
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:38,348
He is having great fun in Goa.
With Tanya. - Yeah.

1597
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:44,016
''Oh, man. He is here.
Back from Goa. CooI.''

1598
01:27:44,425 --> 01:27:46,689
''Hey, what happened? What
happened, Rochak?''

1599
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:47,819
What happened?

1600
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:49,555
What's going on?

1601
01:27:51,432 --> 01:27:53,366
I was kidnapped Iast night.
- What!

1602
01:27:53,434 --> 01:27:54,492
What are you taIking about?

1603
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:59,634
''Look, Iast night I came
back from the pub.''

1604
01:27:59,707 --> 01:28:00,765
And I went to sIeep.

1605
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:03,504
And I woke up tied up to
a chair in a dark room.

1606
01:28:03,845 --> 01:28:05,710
There were 5 guys who kidnapped me.

1607
01:28:06,548 --> 01:28:09,540
I think it was some pIace
near that JubiIee HiIIs.

1608
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:12,381
''Come on, Rochak. You said you
were going to Goa. With Tanya.''

1609
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:16,856
Oh yeah! I didn't go to Goa. I was
kidnapped. BeIieve it or not.

1610
01:28:16,925 --> 01:28:18,392
How did this happen?

1611
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:20,586
Where is Ramesh?
- Why?

1612
01:28:20,895 --> 01:28:22,385
Ramesh is behind this.

1613
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:24,397
Oh come on! What are
you taIking about?

1614
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:26,933
''Yes, your cousin Ramesh is
behind this kidnapping.''

1615
01:28:27,402 --> 01:28:28,460
Why wouId he do that?

1616
01:28:28,536 --> 01:28:30,527
I don't know. It was not me.

1617
01:28:30,605 --> 01:28:32,539
It was you who was supposed
to get kidnapped.

1618
01:28:32,607 --> 01:28:33,869
Come on! I can't beIieve this!

1619
01:28:33,942 --> 01:28:38,345
Oh yeah! Look at this picture.
I fIicked it from the gang.

1620
01:28:38,413 --> 01:28:40,608
This picture was missing
from my bag.

1621
01:28:41,516 --> 01:28:44,952
Trust me. They pIan to take
5 Iakhs ransom from your mom.

1622
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:46,680
Oh gosh! Did you saw Ramesh there?

1623
01:28:46,754 --> 01:28:49,689
No. But I heard them taIking
to him about the kidnapping.

1624
01:28:49,757 --> 01:28:50,883
Oh no! This is too much!

1625
01:28:51,426 --> 01:28:52,484
Oh yeah!

1626
01:28:53,528 --> 01:28:55,894
Do you know what their
next pIan is? - What?

1627
01:28:55,964 --> 01:28:59,491
They pIan to kidnap both of us
for the ransom of 10 Iakhs.

1628
01:28:59,701 --> 01:29:01,760
''Oh no! Prasad, Iet's
go to the poIice.''

1629
01:29:01,836 --> 01:29:03,360
Yeah!
- Prasad!

1630
01:29:03,438 --> 01:29:06,896
''No, I am just thinking which way.
- Which way!''

1631
01:29:07,442 --> 01:29:08,773
There is onIy one way!

1632
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:10,367
Let's go to the poIice!

1633
01:29:10,712 --> 01:29:12,509
So Ramesh is behind aII this?
- Yeah.

1634
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:15,378
Do you know the pIace
where they put you up?

1635
01:29:15,717 --> 01:29:17,844
Somewhere near JubiIee HiIIs.

1636
01:29:18,553 --> 01:29:21,545
So Ramesh knew what you were
doing and where you were.

1637
01:29:21,623 --> 01:29:22,783
''Yeah, exactIy.''

1638
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:24,720
''Prasad, do one thing.''

1639
01:29:25,827 --> 01:29:33,393
Take them to an open pIace. Ramesh
shouId know about this.

1640
01:29:33,668 --> 01:29:36,535
Ramesh wiII sureIy teII
this to the kidnappers.

1641
01:29:37,405 --> 01:29:39,339
As soon as the kidnappers
come there..

1642
01:29:39,407 --> 01:29:42,865
''..our men, who wiII be hiding,
wiII attack and arrest them.''

1643
01:29:43,745 --> 01:29:45,804
It wiII become easy to nab them.

1644
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:47,871
''If we run after them, then
it wiII waste our time.''

1645
01:29:49,517 --> 01:29:51,883
Don't worry. We are with you guys.

1646
01:29:52,754 --> 01:29:54,551
But remember one thing.

1647
01:29:55,423 --> 01:29:58,551
''Whenever you guys Ieave
home, inform us.''

1648
01:29:58,693 --> 01:30:00,354
Okay?
- Yeah.

1649
01:30:00,428 --> 01:30:01,622
Yeah. It's a good idea.

1650
01:30:01,696 --> 01:30:03,561
I know how it works in Hyderabad.

1651
01:30:03,631 --> 01:30:06,498
Here we have to use other
means to compIete the task.

1652
01:30:06,701 --> 01:30:09,363
So you are from which pIace in US.

1653
01:30:09,437 --> 01:30:10,699
We both are from New Jersey.

1654
01:30:10,772 --> 01:30:12,763
Okay. My brother is
aIso from America.

1655
01:30:13,441 --> 01:30:15,705
He is a software professionaI.
He is in San Francisco.

1656
01:30:15,777 --> 01:30:16,835
Okay.

1657
01:30:16,911 --> 01:30:18,572
Don't worry. Hyderabad
poIice wiII take care.

1658
01:30:18,646 --> 01:30:20,511
''Okay, Shrinivas. Thank you.
- Okay.''

1659
01:30:20,581 --> 01:30:21,775
Okay. Thank you.

1660
01:30:21,849 --> 01:30:23,510
Thank you very much.
- Don't worry.

1661
01:30:24,452 --> 01:30:25,510
Bye.
- Thank you very much.

1662
01:30:25,586 --> 01:30:26,644
Bye.

1663
01:30:31,492 --> 01:30:33,323
''What happened to your
neck, IsmaiI-bhai?''

1664
01:30:33,394 --> 01:30:36,329
Mosquito bite. Forget that.
What about the foreigners?

1665
01:30:36,397 --> 01:30:38,797
''Greetings, IsmaiI-bhai.
- Greetings.''

1666
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:40,799
Is everything fine?
- Yes.

1667
01:30:40,868 --> 01:30:42,335
''What happened, IsmaiI-bhai?''

1668
01:30:42,403 --> 01:30:44,337
You thrashed the foreigners
who had bashed you?

1669
01:30:44,405 --> 01:30:45,736
Get Iost!

1670
01:30:45,807 --> 01:30:48,605
''IsmaiI-bhai, if you wiII stay with
them then nothing wiII happen.''

1671
01:30:48,676 --> 01:30:51,338
I wiII send my men. They
know this kind of job.

1672
01:30:51,412 --> 01:30:52,470
''Boss, he has gone mad.''

1673
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:54,341
Get Iost.

1674
01:30:54,415 --> 01:30:56,474
''Look, IsmaiI-bhai. I can do
anything for your sake.''

1675
01:30:56,551 --> 01:30:58,348
You can do anything?
- Yes.

1676
01:30:58,686 --> 01:31:01,348
''TeII me, can you say where
are those foreigners.''

1677
01:31:01,422 --> 01:31:02,548
Can you say where they are?

1678
01:31:02,757 --> 01:31:05,954
''Within 10 minutes, I can
say where they are,''

1679
01:31:06,427 --> 01:31:08,486
Then you say it within 10 minutes.
I am sitting here onIy.

1680
01:31:09,764 --> 01:31:11,026
''Chote, get one tea.''

1681
01:31:11,432 --> 01:31:13,366
''IsmaiI-bhai, give me the phone.
- Why?''

1682
01:31:13,434 --> 01:31:14,765
You wiII come to know.

1683
01:31:19,874 --> 01:31:22,365
''Yusuf, I had asked you
for the address.''

1684
01:31:22,443 --> 01:31:23,774
Find out about it.

1685
01:31:23,845 --> 01:31:24,903
''I am doing that, boss.''

1686
01:31:24,979 --> 01:31:26,844
The traffic poIiceman nabbed me
as I was not wearing the heImet.

1687
01:31:26,914 --> 01:31:29,382
''Okay, do it quickIy. It
is IsmaiI-bhai's work.''

1688
01:31:29,450 --> 01:31:30,781
You don't get such work easiIy.

1689
01:31:30,852 --> 01:31:33,320
WiII you give me 200 rupees
to pay to the poIiceman?

1690
01:31:33,388 --> 01:31:34,582
Okay. I wiII give it.

1691
01:31:34,655 --> 01:31:36,782
''The traffic poIiceman caught me.
There is no petroI too,''

1692
01:31:36,858 --> 01:31:39,588
''SaIim, you give me nice
work to do! Thank you.''

1693
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:43,991
Don't thank me. Thank IsmaiI-bhai.
Just do the work.

1694
01:31:46,401 --> 01:31:47,663
Did you see my connections?

1695
01:31:47,735 --> 01:31:49,930
PeopIe thank me for giving
them the task to do.

1696
01:31:50,405 --> 01:31:51,804
I wiII get the caII
within 10 minutes.

1697
01:31:51,873 --> 01:31:53,534
Fine. We wiII come to know.

1698
01:32:04,419 --> 01:32:05,681
HeIIo. Where are you going?

1699
01:32:06,421 --> 01:32:09,356
I am going to meet those guys
who had come from America.

1700
01:32:09,424 --> 01:32:10,482
Where did you come from?

1701
01:32:10,558 --> 01:32:12,822
Where did I come from?
I work at ReIiance.

1702
01:32:13,428 --> 01:32:15,362
Nowadays peopIe buy ReIiance
phone for free.

1703
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:18,024
''Their biII comes to 80,000-90,000.
And they run away.''

1704
01:32:18,433 --> 01:32:20,367
These sirs are good.
They pay on time.

1705
01:32:20,435 --> 01:32:22,494
So I have come to take the biII.
And I aIso want to taIk to them.

1706
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:23,764
''Fine, sir. Sir, one minute.''

1707
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:26,700
They are not at home.
I forgot to teII you.

1708
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:28,899
They have gone to GoIkonda. They
wiII return in the evening.

1709
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:31,777
''Is that so? Fine, I wiII go
and coIIect it from GoIkonda.''

1710
01:32:34,382 --> 01:32:36,646
40 minutes have passed. The
caII has stiII not come.

1711
01:32:36,717 --> 01:32:37,843
Don't you know?

1712
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:40,320
In Hyderabad 10 minutes
means 40 minutes.

1713
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:41,514
Where are you?

1714
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:45,450
''Yes, Yusuf. TeII me.''

1715
01:32:45,526 --> 01:32:47,323
''SaIim-bhai, they have
gone to GoIkonda.''

1716
01:32:47,395 --> 01:32:48,657
Is that so?

1717
01:32:48,729 --> 01:32:51,527
''Yes, they wiII return in the
evening. Bhai, my money..''

1718
01:32:51,833 --> 01:32:54,461
You don't worry. Your
work wiII be done.

1719
01:32:54,535 --> 01:32:56,332
Fine? Okay.

1720
01:32:56,404 --> 01:32:58,531
TeII me. What did you find out?

1721
01:32:58,606 --> 01:33:01,336
''Yes. IsmaiI-bhai, they
are at GoIkonda.''

1722
01:33:01,409 --> 01:33:02,535
Is that so?

1723
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:04,544
If you hired such useIess peopIe..

1724
01:33:04,612 --> 01:33:06,477
''..then what wiII happen to your
reputation, IsmaiI-bhai.''

1725
01:33:06,681 --> 01:33:08,342
Now wiII you go to GoIkonda?

1726
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:09,883
What are you saying?

1727
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:13,353
Do you think that we
are useIess peopIe?

1728
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:15,548
Come on! Let's go! Come! Come!

1729
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:21,819
Wow! Nice pIace!

1730
01:33:21,896 --> 01:33:23,488
So the cops and guns
are coming. Right?

1731
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:26,297
No cops. No guns.
- What!

1732
01:33:26,367 --> 01:33:27,493
We are on our own.
- Oh no!

1733
01:33:29,637 --> 01:33:32,765
You guys go ahead. My
men are aIready inside.

1734
01:33:33,374 --> 01:33:35,308
You guys give us a signaI when
you see the kidnappers.

1735
01:33:35,643 --> 01:33:36,837
We wiII come and arrest them.

1736
01:33:37,378 --> 01:33:39,312
Okay! Okay! Let's go.
- Don't worry.

1737
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:40,438
Carry on.

1738
01:33:40,515 --> 01:33:42,312
''HeIIo, Rajeshwar.
They are coming in.''

1739
01:33:42,383 --> 01:33:43,509
You guys take your position.

1740
01:33:43,651 --> 01:33:44,913
''Guys, be carefuI.''

1741
01:33:53,728 --> 01:33:56,458
What is this? I gave
you 1000 rupees.

1742
01:33:56,531 --> 01:33:59,659
And you got these attires. You
bought torn shoes! FooI!

1743
01:33:59,734 --> 01:34:02,328
''IsmaiI-bhai, if we went
in these cIothes..''

1744
01:34:02,403 --> 01:34:03,665
..then nobody wiII recognize us.

1745
01:34:03,738 --> 01:34:05,535
Neither the foreigner nor
the peopIe of this area.

1746
01:34:05,673 --> 01:34:07,732
''If we beat somebody, nobody
wiII come to know.''

1747
01:34:07,808 --> 01:34:09,537
''And if somebody bashes us, stiII
nobody wiII come to know.''

1748
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:11,737
My fare.
- How much?

1749
01:34:11,812 --> 01:34:12,938
500 rupees.
- 500 rupees.

1750
01:34:13,514 --> 01:34:15,345
''Boss, he is a poor man.''

1751
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:19,352
We just reached here. We got down.

1752
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:20,819
And you started asking
for your fare.

1753
01:34:20,888 --> 01:34:22,549
Do you think that IsmaiI-bhai
is an ordinary man?

1754
01:34:22,623 --> 01:34:25,490
He has royaI connection.
You got his oId car.

1755
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:28,290
PeopIe bring 10 cars when they
hear IsmaiI-bhai's name.

1756
01:34:28,362 --> 01:34:29,624
IsmaiI-bhai.
- What!

1757
01:34:29,697 --> 01:34:30,755
Asking for 500 rupees!

1758
01:34:30,831 --> 01:34:31,889
Give 200 rupees. I wiII
handIe the rest.

1759
01:34:32,366 --> 01:34:33,424
Give 200 rupees.

1760
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:37,564
You guys go. I wiII just come.

1761
01:34:37,638 --> 01:34:38,832
''Come on! IsmaiI-bhai, come!''

1762
01:34:39,373 --> 01:34:41,705
You wiII aIso remember.
Take 100 rupees.

1763
01:34:41,776 --> 01:34:43,300
IsmaiI-bhai has come from Dubai.

1764
01:34:43,377 --> 01:34:44,503
And he is giving 100 rupees.

1765
01:34:44,579 --> 01:34:47,514
My saIary is Iess.
- Adjust it somehow.

1766
01:34:47,582 --> 01:34:49,311
We wiII settIe the account Iater.
I wiII teII you Iater.

1767
01:34:49,717 --> 01:34:52,709
What passenger have I got
earIy in the morning!

1768
01:34:54,388 --> 01:34:55,446
''HeIIo, Bipasha.''

1769
01:35:03,397 --> 01:35:05,865
You guys are foIIowing me?
- Oh yeah. We are behind you.

1770
01:35:05,933 --> 01:35:07,867
''What about you, Prasad?
- Yeah, we are behind you.''

1771
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:14,330
''You guys don't worry, man.''

1772
01:35:18,746 --> 01:35:20,737
What if the kidnappers get
to us before the cop?

1773
01:35:31,759 --> 01:35:34,023
Let me get my hands on those
foreigners. I wiII not spare them!

1774
01:35:34,428 --> 01:35:36,362
''We wiII bash the foreigners
onIy if we find them, boss.''

1775
01:35:48,442 --> 01:35:50,910
Look around. Look at the gaps.

1776
01:35:50,978 --> 01:35:53,378
''Look around.
- Anna, they are not to be seen.''

1777
01:35:53,447 --> 01:35:54,505
Look around carefuIIy.

1778
01:36:00,788 --> 01:36:04,519
''Today we have to nab both of them.
- Okay, Anna.''

1779
01:36:05,793 --> 01:36:08,523
''Okay, guys. Make sure if you
see the kidnappers just run.''

1780
01:36:08,596 --> 01:36:09,654
''I am there, Rochak.''

1781
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:12,392
The kidnappers! Come on! Run!
- Oh no!

1782
01:36:12,466 --> 01:36:13,524
Run! Run!

1783
01:36:21,475 --> 01:36:22,737
''Oh no! Oh no, Rochak! Wait for me!''

1784
01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:24,072
Get Iost!

1785
01:36:28,749 --> 01:36:30,341
''Boss, what are the
Iovers doing here?''

1786
01:36:30,418 --> 01:36:32,352
Oh no! Let's run! Run!

1787
01:36:32,687 --> 01:36:36,555
''They ran away! Hey, Iook here! Run!''

1788
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:38,353
Nab them! Nab them!

1789
01:36:45,766 --> 01:36:47,757
Where did they go? Let's see here.

1790
01:37:09,457 --> 01:37:11,857
Where did they go? Let's see here.

1791
01:37:13,794 --> 01:37:15,853
Oh no! Oh no! There are 2 guys!

1792
01:37:15,930 --> 01:37:17,522
Run! Run!

1793
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:21,665
''SaIim, nab them! Nab them!''

1794
01:37:27,742 --> 01:37:29,334
Come on! Come on!

1795
01:37:29,410 --> 01:37:30,877
Behind you! Oh no!

1796
01:37:36,417 --> 01:37:37,679
Anna!

1797
01:37:37,752 --> 01:37:39,344
Kidnappers! Oh no!

1798
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:40,478
Anna! Anna!
- Nab them!

1799
01:37:40,554 --> 01:37:41,680
Don't go anywhere.

01:37:41,756 --> 01:37:45,351
Hey! Hey! Hey! Stay back!
Stay back! You! You! You!

1801
01:37:45,426 --> 01:37:47,360
Step back! Move forward

1802
01:37:47,428 --> 01:37:49,760
That's it!
- I wiII shoot you!

1803
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:51,354
You guys don't worry. I
know how to use this gun.

1804
01:37:51,432 --> 01:37:53,696
You scare me with the pistoI!
You scare me with the pistoI!

1805

I wiII shoot you! You

1806
01:37:55,436 --> 01:37:56,494

Hey! Hey!

You scare me with water pistoI!

Do you think that I am a fooI!
Do you think that I am a fooI!

01:38:06,447 --> 01:38:07,573
Look there! Look there!

01:38:07,648 --> 01:38:09,843
''Look there! Look there! Look,

1814
01:38:09,917 --> 01:38:12,385
''Ramesh paid them. Ramesh
paid them 10,000.''

1815
01:38:12,453 --> 01:38:14,785
In advance. To kidnap us.

1816
01:38:14,855 --> 01:38:16,379
''Yeah. 10,000 in advance.''

1817
01:38:16,457 --> 01:38:18,391
Those guys! Those guys!
Yeah. Competition.

1818
01:38:18,459 --> 01:38:20,393
Ramesh paid them.
- Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1819
01:38:20,461 --> 01:38:22,725
He doubIe-crossed us! Keep quiet!

1820
01:38:22,797 --> 01:38:24,389
''Hey, MaIay. You Iook after them.''

1821
01:38:24,465 --> 01:38:26,865
I wiII go and handIe them. Let's go.

1822
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:32,537
SaIim.. they are coming towards us.

1823
01:38:32,606 --> 01:38:33,732
Oh God! Run!

1824
01:38:33,808 --> 01:38:36,743
Thrash them!
- Beat them!

1825
01:38:40,414 --> 01:38:42,814
Do you want money? Money? DoIIars?

1826
01:38:42,883 --> 01:38:44,350
Do you want doIIars?

1827
01:38:44,418 --> 01:38:46,352
Oh God!

1828
01:38:50,424 --> 01:38:51,550
Oh God!

1829
01:39:14,448 --> 01:39:16,382
Ramesh gave my money to you guys!

1830
01:39:16,717 --> 01:39:18,048
ScoundreIs.

1831
01:39:19,453 --> 01:39:20,579
Do you want money? Money?

1832
01:39:20,654 --> 01:39:22,383
Don't worry. Don't worry.
You wiII get it.

1833
01:39:22,456 --> 01:39:23,718
Indian doIIars.
- Take it.

1834
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:25,383
5000 rupees.

1835
01:39:26,861 --> 01:39:28,920
We wiII go. Have 'Biryani'.
Take care.

1836
01:39:28,996 --> 01:39:30,861
Bye. See you.

01:39:30,931 --> 01:39:32,728
Thanks.

1838
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,529
Run.
- Take this water gun.

1839
01:39:34,602 --> 01:39:35,864
Fast! Keep running!

1840
01:39:35,936 --> 01:39:37,870
Anna! They ran away. Anna!

1841
01:39:38,405 --> 01:39:39,667
What are you saying?

1842
01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:42,334
They ran away! Anna!
- How did you Iet them go?

1843
01:39:42,409 --> 01:39:44,468
''These 3 ran away, Anna.
- How did they run away?''

1844
01:39:44,678 --> 01:39:46,339
''Come on, guys! Come on!''

1845
01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:55,354
Nobody move! Nab them!

1846
01:39:55,422 --> 01:39:57,356
Smarty!

1847
01:39:57,424 --> 01:39:58,482
Arrest them.

1848
01:39:58,559 --> 01:39:59,617
You guys were buIIying around.

1849
01:39:59,693 --> 01:40:01,024
Come on! Go!

1850
01:40:01,362 --> 01:40:02,420
Take them away.

1851
01:40:05,699 --> 01:40:07,030
They bashed us so badIy.

1852
01:40:07,101 --> 01:40:10,696
HeIIo. I am busy in my work.
I wiII caII you Iater.

1853
01:40:11,705 --> 01:40:12,831
Hey!

1854
01:40:20,881 --> 01:40:22,781
''Yes, you got out of the mess
with the oId city guys.''

1855
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:25,045
Yeah. They got it very bad I guess.

1856
01:40:25,386 --> 01:40:29,322
''WeII, they can do haIf of the
things that they say. - Yeah.''

1857
01:40:29,390 --> 01:40:31,858
I think you know more about
Hyderabad now. - Yeah.

1858
01:40:34,395 --> 01:40:35,521
What do you think of yourseIf?

1859
01:40:35,596 --> 01:40:37,325
You came to my house without..

1860
01:40:37,398 --> 01:40:38,990
..my knowIedge with
a marriage proposaI!

1861
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:42,335
Who do you think you are!
You think I Iove you? No!

1862
01:40:43,404 --> 01:40:45,338
''SheetaI, it's not Iike that.''

1863
01:40:45,406 --> 01:40:46,600
My parents have misunderstood me.

1864
01:40:46,807 --> 01:40:48,866
They ask me about you
every singIe day.

1865
01:40:48,943 --> 01:40:50,342
And what am I supposed to say?

1866
01:40:50,411 --> 01:40:51,810
You created a compIete
heII in my house!

1867
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:53,676
My parents Iost trust in me!

1868
01:40:54,415 --> 01:40:56,007
''SheetaI, pIease Iisten to me first.''

1869
01:40:56,083 --> 01:40:58,347
You keep quiet. Let me finish.

1870
01:40:58,852 --> 01:41:01,685
We Indian girIs are not
what you NRIs think!

1871
01:41:02,423 --> 01:41:03,822
We are weII brought up!

1872
01:41:03,891 --> 01:41:05,825
And go according to our
parents' IifestyIe.

1873
01:41:07,428 --> 01:41:08,827
You aII Iisten to me carefuIIy!

1874
01:41:09,530 --> 01:41:12,693
We girIs have a good Iife
and we enjoy work.

1875
01:41:13,534 --> 01:41:15,365
PIease don't screw it up for us!

1876
01:41:19,773 --> 01:41:22,901
''Pranay, you hurt me.. reaIIy badIy.''

1877
01:41:25,379 --> 01:41:27,973
''I hate you. I hate you, Pranay!''

1878
01:41:30,651 --> 01:41:31,777
I hate you!

1879
01:41:31,852 --> 01:41:34,320
''SheetaI! SheetaI, pIease
Iisten to me! SheetaI!''

1880
01:41:38,659 --> 01:41:41,321
''Pranay, don't worry. Things
wiII be aII right.''

1881
01:41:41,829 --> 01:41:44,992
Go home. Take rest. And
I wiII see you tomorrow.

1882
01:41:51,605 --> 01:41:54,665
I hurt her. I made a mistake.

1883
01:42:01,415 --> 01:42:02,882
''Come on, SheetaI! Don't feeI so sad.''

1884
01:42:03,417 --> 01:42:04,748
''SheetaI, pIease.''

1885
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:09,685
''It's okay, SheetaI.
It's okay. PIease.''

1886
01:42:09,757 --> 01:42:10,815
''SheetaI, don't cry.''

1887
01:42:10,891 --> 01:42:11,949
Come on.

1888
01:42:12,426 --> 01:42:15,361
''I am reaIIy sorry, SheetaI.
About what I did.''

1889
01:42:15,696 --> 01:42:18,756
ActuaIIy I toId Pranay to go to
your house and taIk to your parents.

1890
01:42:19,433 --> 01:42:21,492
Prasad! How can you do this!

1891
01:42:24,772 --> 01:42:27,297
SheetaI.. I know Pranay.

1892
01:42:28,375 --> 01:42:29,501
He reaIIy Ioves you honestIy.

1893
01:42:31,478 --> 01:42:33,309
He just doesn't know
how to express it.

1894
01:42:34,381 --> 01:42:36,315
You said one day to him..
that you wiII..

1895
01:42:36,383 --> 01:42:37,645
..marry someone of your
parent's choice.

1896
01:42:38,385 --> 01:42:40,580
He thought that if your parents
agreed then you wiII agree too.

1897
01:42:40,854 --> 01:42:42,651
He didn't mean to hurt your parents.

1898
01:42:45,659 --> 01:42:47,991
''And SheetaI, its not that
NRIs think differentIy.''

1899
01:42:48,729 --> 01:42:50,321
We think just Iike you do.

1900
01:42:50,664 --> 01:42:52,928
Maybe we are born and go up
in different countries.

1901
01:42:53,734 --> 01:42:55,463
But we are Indians just Iike you.

1902
01:42:57,404 --> 01:42:59,463
Pranay aIways wanted to
marry a girI from India.

1903
01:43:00,507 --> 01:43:03,340
Someone as Ioving..
as caring as his mom.

1904
01:43:04,411 --> 01:43:05,878
She taIks about India aII the time.

1905
01:43:07,748 --> 01:43:10,478
I know him. I am not onIy his buddy.

1906
01:43:11,752 --> 01:43:13,344
According to me Pranay
didn't commit..

1907
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:15,354
..a mistake by taIking
to your parents.

1908
01:43:15,856 --> 01:43:17,346
In fact he did a good thing.

1909
01:43:17,424 --> 01:43:19,688
And it shows that he
honestIy Ioves you.

1910
01:43:25,799 --> 01:43:27,289
''That's aII I have to say, SheetaI.''

1911
01:43:36,710 --> 01:43:38,837
''Don't worry, SheetaI. Everything
wiII be aII right.''

1912
01:43:47,921 --> 01:43:50,446
''Ramesh, here is 50 thousand
rupees cheque.''

1913
01:43:50,524 --> 01:43:52,515
Okay. PIease stop doing bad things.

1914
01:43:52,593 --> 01:43:53,719
And start some good business.

1915
01:43:54,394 --> 01:43:56,988
''Thank you for everything,
Ramesh. Goodbye. Okay.''

1916
01:43:57,664 --> 01:43:58,722
''Where are you going, brother?''

1917
01:43:58,799 --> 01:43:59,993
Back to US. Bye.

1918
01:44:04,404 --> 01:44:07,737
''Okay. Okay, bye.''

1919
01:44:10,744 --> 01:44:12,336
Rochak.. Ramesh caIIed up saying..

1920
01:44:12,412 --> 01:44:14,539
..that Pranay is Ieaving
for the US now.

1921
01:44:14,615 --> 01:44:15,741
What!

1922
01:44:20,854 --> 01:44:24,346
''Pranay, what are you doing,
dude! We can fix this!''

1923
01:44:24,758 --> 01:44:28,421
''Dude, thanks. Some things in
your Iife, you can't fix.''

1924
01:44:28,495 --> 01:44:31,692
So Ieave it to time. Remember
when we first came to India?

1925
01:44:31,765 --> 01:44:34,290
I said you wiII be the first
one to go back to the US.

1926
01:44:34,635 --> 01:44:36,500
I was wrong. It's me.

1927
01:44:36,570 --> 01:44:39,835
''Dude, things can be worked out.''

1928
01:44:40,374 --> 01:44:42,433
''Listen, we wiII taIk
to SheetaI. Okay.''

1929
01:44:42,643 --> 01:44:45,305
''No, dude. I hurt SheetaI.
I hurt her.''

1930
01:44:45,379 --> 01:44:46,437
''Dude, Iisten!''

1931
01:44:46,513 --> 01:44:47,775
''Take care, Rochak. Bye.''

1932
01:44:47,848 --> 01:44:48,906
''Dude, Iisten!''

1933
01:44:50,317 --> 01:44:51,375
What happened?

1934
01:44:53,487 --> 01:44:59,653
I know Pranay. He is very
sensitive. He is gone.

1935
01:45:11,471 --> 01:45:12,597
''Bhavana, do you know?
- What?''

1936
01:45:12,673 --> 01:45:13,731
Pranay.
- Yes.

1937
01:45:13,807 --> 01:45:16,742
He went back to America.
- When?

1938
01:45:16,810 --> 01:45:17,868
Last evening.

1939
01:45:18,412 --> 01:45:22,678
Very sad. I misunderstood
those guys.

1940
01:45:23,417 --> 01:45:26,545
Prasad expIained everything
about them.

1941
01:45:27,754 --> 01:45:31,554
Nowadays it is difficuIt to
find a guy who Ioves so much.

1942
01:45:33,427 --> 01:45:35,361
SheetaI is so Iucky.

1943
01:45:35,696 --> 01:45:37,561
But what wouId she have done?

1944
01:46:16,803 --> 01:46:18,395
''Pranay!
- Hi, SheetaI!''

1945
01:46:18,472 --> 01:46:20,406
What are you doing here?
I thought you were gone!

1946
01:46:20,474 --> 01:46:21,941
''I never Ieft, SheetaI.''

1947
01:46:22,476 --> 01:46:24,410
I am reaIIy sorry..
for what happened.

1948
01:46:24,478 --> 01:46:25,809
They said you Ieft for US.

1949
01:46:25,946 --> 01:46:28,813
''What I did was wrong. No,
actuaIIy it is right.''

1950
01:46:29,416 --> 01:46:32,351
Because I reaIIy Iove you. I want
to marry a girI Iike you.

1951
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:35,351
You shouId have toId
me first at Ieast.

1952
01:46:35,689 --> 01:46:37,816
I was trying to do that. But
this Prasad stopped me!

1953
01:46:38,425 --> 01:46:40,359
And you know.. you are
Iooking so beautifuI.

1954
01:46:41,695 --> 01:46:42,821
Wow!

1955
01:46:44,765 --> 01:46:46,824
''Hey, Pranay! What the heII!
How did you come back?''

1956
01:46:46,900 --> 01:46:48,367
What do you mean?

1957
01:46:48,435 --> 01:46:49,902
The porter.. I paid him 500
bucks to get me out of there.

1958
01:46:50,437 --> 01:46:52,029
You paid him 500 bucks?
- Yeah.

1959
01:46:52,439 --> 01:46:53,906
''Dude, you are supposed
to pay 200 bucks!''

1960
01:46:53,974 --> 01:46:55,498
How did you pay him 500 bucks!

1961
01:46:55,575 --> 01:46:57,509
''Come on, man! Don't behave
Iike a Hyderabadi!''

1962
01:46:57,711 --> 01:46:59,372
It's happy to be back.

1963
01:46:59,446 --> 01:47:01,380
''Come on, guys! Let's have a party!''

1964
01:47:02,449 --> 01:47:05,907
These NRI guys enticed our girIs.

1965
01:47:06,453 --> 01:47:07,511
''Come on, Laxmi.''

1966
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:14,859
''You know, Pranay and Rochak..''

1967
01:47:14,928 --> 01:47:16,395
..promised me a nice NRI match.

1968
01:47:16,463 --> 01:47:17,930
And I wiII marry onIy NRI!

1969
01:47:21,468 --> 01:47:23,527
How much?
- 400 kg. 450 kg.

1970
01:47:24,471 --> 01:47:25,460
Weigh it properIy!

1971
01:47:25,539 --> 01:47:27,473
Look what is the state of
the shop because of you!

1972
01:47:28,408 --> 01:47:29,466
FooI!

1973
01:47:29,543 --> 01:47:30,601
What did you say?

1974
01:47:30,677 --> 01:47:33,475
Nothing. It is 400 kg.

1975
01:47:34,748 --> 01:47:36,340
Even dog's Iife is better than this.

1976
01:47:43,857 --> 01:47:45,688
HeIIo. Who?
- Ahmed speaking.

1977
01:47:45,759 --> 01:47:47,818
''Ahmed-bhai, greetings. How are you?''

1978
01:47:47,894 --> 01:47:49,020
Fine. Where are you?

1979
01:47:49,429 --> 01:47:51,693
''Ahmed-bhai, I have changed the car.''

1980
01:47:51,765 --> 01:47:52,959
I have purchased a new Maruti.

1981
01:47:53,433 --> 01:47:54,559
It was troubIing me a bit.

1982
01:47:54,634 --> 01:47:55,760
So I am getting it repaired
in the garage.

1983
01:47:55,836 --> 01:47:57,030
''What eIse, Ahmed-bhai?''

1984
01:47:57,104 --> 01:47:58,366
Come soon in the evening.
To pick the baggage.

1985
01:47:58,438 --> 01:47:59,837
''Okay, Ahmed-bhai. Okay.''

1986
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:02,840
You are sending the QuaIis.
What is the need for that?

1987
01:48:03,777 --> 01:48:05,369
Fine. As you say.

1988
01:48:06,446 --> 01:48:08,505
Did you hear that?
It was Ahmed-bhai.

1989
01:48:08,582 --> 01:48:09,913
He aIways sends the car on time.

1990
01:48:10,450 --> 01:48:11,576
He takes good care of me.

1991
01:48:11,651 --> 01:48:13,380
Is that so? Take your Maruti car.

1992
01:48:13,453 --> 01:48:14,511
I hope it wiII not give
me any probIem.

1993
01:48:14,588 --> 01:48:15,782
It wiII work fine.

1994
01:48:29,736 --> 01:48:32,933
My Iife got ruined in the
company of IsmaiI-bhai.

1995
01:48:33,407 --> 01:48:34,465
My voice too is ruined.

1996
01:48:34,541 --> 01:48:36,873
My Iife is ruined.

1997
01:48:37,411 --> 01:48:39,345
That oId man made me wander around..

1998
01:48:39,413 --> 01:48:42,814
..and he gave me some teas for free.

1999
01:48:42,883 --> 01:48:46,341
What did you say? BeteI Ieaf?
I wiII make one for you.

2000
01:48:46,420 --> 01:48:49,617
This is the best beteI Ieaf. You
wiII not find it anywhere.

2001
01:48:49,689 --> 01:48:51,623
Take this. Your beteI Ieaf is ready.

2002
01:48:51,691 --> 01:48:53,352
Here I am Ieading a good Iife.

2003
01:48:53,427 --> 01:48:56,362
My Iife is set. I have this shop.

2004
01:48:56,430 --> 01:48:58,557
Move aside. Make way. Let him come.

2005
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:03,692
''Paper is cIear. Yes, it is cIear.''

2006
01:49:04,771 --> 01:49:09,708
''Yes, check the paper. Fine, fine.''

2007
01:49:09,776 --> 01:49:11,835
''Greetings, Anna. How are you, Anna?''

2008
01:49:12,446 --> 01:49:14,380
''Anna, give me some work too.''

2009
01:49:15,449 --> 01:49:17,041
Why did you come here?

2010
01:49:17,451 --> 01:49:20,386
Because of that kidnapping
case the poIice nabbed me.

2011
01:49:20,454 --> 01:49:22,854
I gave up my profession.
Now why have you come?

2012
01:49:23,457 --> 01:49:27,450
I gave up aII that! I gave aII up!
Go away from here! Get Iost!

2013
01:49:27,527 --> 01:49:28,858
''PIease, Anna.''

2014
01:49:28,929 --> 01:49:31,329
''ScoundreI! Hey, you aII.

2015
01:49:31,398 --> 01:49:33,662
''If anybody comes, take my name.
And give my number.''

2016
01:49:33,733 --> 01:49:34,859
''Okay, Anna.
- Okay, Anna.''

2017
01:49:35,735 --> 01:49:39,466
''You aII cIean the pIace.
Paint it, and adorn it.''

2018
01:49:39,539 --> 01:49:40,870
I wiII Iook after it.

2019
01:49:41,408 --> 01:49:44,468
Who put up the board? Throw it.
