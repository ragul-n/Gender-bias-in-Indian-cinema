1
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,354
Yes! Diya speaking.

2
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,750
Diya, your teacher is taking
his last breathes.

3
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,587
He's dying.

4
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:20,887
Come quick.

5
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,619
Diya!
Diya!

6
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:25,994
Yes, I'm coming.

7
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,366
Don't eat that much chili.

8
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,130
You will die some day.

9
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,232
Have this sweet.

10
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,897
I won't die that quick.

11
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,136
Until I fill this town with art.

12
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,803
First come of out
these round stairs.

13
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,314
All of the town
call you a madman.

14
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,745
Art doesn't need town,

15
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,617
towns need art.

16
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,184
Whatever!

17
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,621
Alright, I'll come again
tomorrow to learn.

18
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,582
Only if I have the right mood.

19
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:10,994
Go away, you witch.

20
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,891
You aren't doing any
favor if you come to learn.

21
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,126
I'm saying if you don't pay the
bill electricity will be disconnected.

22
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,432
Yes, it is.

23
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,564
Go you have electricity.
Let me have my food.

24
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:25,669
Have it.

25
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:26,841
Let's go.

26
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:41,993
Why haven't you had your
dinner yet?

27
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,453
Does he ever eat without you?

28
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,164
Mother, why did you married
with this big blackmailer?

29
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,093
You still can change yourself.

30
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,798
Stay away from that
Ajanta "Bakwasi" (Crap).

31
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:54,737
What "Bakwasi"?

32
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:58,402
You entertain yourself with Lata
Mangeshkar and Mumtaz singing.

33
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,378
And when you daughter sings
and dances, it's "Bakwasi" to you.

34
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:01,845
What are you saying dude?

35
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,347
Why do you talk to me like that?

36
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,974
Are you out of your mind?

37
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,451
There's is something as Style!

38
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,225
You won't go to Ajanta.

39
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:16,457
What are you doing aunty?

40
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,962
Najma, don't.
- I'm going.

41
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:24,930
Let her go,

42
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,165
it won't take anything if
she does one program.

43
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,634
You haven't passed through
that Ajanta place.

44
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,144
There's always voices of singing
and dances coming from there.

45
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:34,509
Don't know what would
have been going on there?

46
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:38,675
If there are voices of dancing and
singing then it must be it.

47
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,286
We are all ready.

48
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,619
It's a must see.

49
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,282
A new from Ajanta!

50
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,596
He's back again.

51
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,294
What are you doing?

52
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,267
What are you doing witch?

53
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,637
He's Steve.

54
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,703
From National Geographic Magazine
from America.

55
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,308
He's here to take pictures
of Indian artists.

56
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:18,042
You too should have your
photos taken.

57
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,055
Listen, take him with
you to see the town.

58
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,181
If you don't mind.

59
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,451
We don't mind.

60
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:33,732
How are you Mohan?

61
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,163
I was craving for your tea today.

62
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:37,566
Tea and hotel both are yours.
Come, sit.

63
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,800
He's Mr. Steve.
Came from America?

64
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:48,742
Why?

65
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,406
Hi, I'm Steve.

66
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,418
Why don't you bring
some Pakoras with Chili.

67
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,253
Right away.

68
00:10:58,624 --> 00:10:59,818
Prepare 3 cups of tea
and some Pakoras.

69
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,086
O stupid,

70
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,095
You'll keep on serving Pakoras

71
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,859
and the Whiteman will
fly away with the girl.

72
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,394
We have fixed your marriage.

73
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:25,860
What?

74
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,704
With Mohan

75
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,005
You'll finish your program
by tomorrow.

76
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,408
Mohan has prepared for the engagement
on the day after tomorrow.

77
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,442
Buy whatever you want for
the occasion by tomorrow.

78
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:14,308
Am I doing anything wrong?

79
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,281
No,

80
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,277
Art is what's coming
out of your heart.

81
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,911
And what stays in the
heart is darkness.

82
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:27,482
You're not born to
follow this world,

83
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,960
you're born to dance
on your own heartbeats.

84
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,032
Spread your wings and fly.

85
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,091
Fly away my child.

86
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,812
I called many times from America.

87
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:04,182
But the phone kept on ringing.

88
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,459
Later I found out from Najma

89
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:11,494
that Mom and Papa left Shamli
because of the embarrassment.

90
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:13,826
Don't know where?

91
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,895
Najma was about to get married.

92
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,569
So she was restricted
from talking to me.

93
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:26,272
I called my teacher too, but no one
wanted to hear his name.

94
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,945
Don't know what people might
have done to him.

95
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:37,481
After going to America, Steve
didn't remain the Steve I met before.

96
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,955
Then I realized.

97
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,618
That he and I were never
meant for each other.

98
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,218
Till then I was already pregnant.

99
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,332
Then you came in to my life.

100
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,124
I found a new reason to live.

101
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,204
I forgot Shamli

102
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,706
and started a new life in America.

103
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,802
With the person I love
most in the world.

104
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:01,578
I love you mom.

105
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,705
Thank you,
I didn't know that.

106
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:37,609
You took too long.

107
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:40,609
He's gone.

108
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,413
He passed away last night.

109
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:53,889
He was saying, he's done
with the drama of this world.

110
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,570
He will continue in the
next world.

111
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,206
Witch!

112
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,111
You haven't stopped being late.
Have you?

113
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,016
How are you?

114
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,848
What's wrong?
Are you mad at me?

115
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,217
I haven't called you
since all those years...

116
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,222
I didn't tell you how I was
doing and how Ajanta was?

117
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,992
What could I tell you?

118
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:09,169
Since you left... seemed like
Ajanta had lost it's soul.

119
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,740
And then gradually everyone
had left Ajanta alone.

120
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:39,599
Children had stopped coming
to Ajanta.

121
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,201
Their parents weren't
allowing them to come.

122
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,636
They were afraid, there might
be another Diya.

123
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,012
Who could have be
like you?

124
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,218
Ajanta is finished.

125
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:04,957
Look, I won't lie to you.

126
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,225
I'm dying.

127
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,903
How? Why? There's no use
of talking about that.

128
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,697
I don't have time for all this,

129
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,902
neither Ajanta does.

130
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:28,484
Diya, these people are trying
demolish Ajanta.

131
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,383
Just for the sake of money.

132
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:41,090
An old, this old temple of art,
they're trying to destroy.

133
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:48,165
I and Doctor, we fought a lot.

134
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,208
We cried a lot.

135
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:54,736
We pleaded a lot.

136
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,475
But who will listen to us?

137
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,686
You save Ajanta.

138
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:04,855
You can save Ajanta.

139
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,389
Please save Ajanta from
breaking apart.

140
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:12,825
Save Ajanta.

141
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,467
He has ordered to demolish Ajanta.

142
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:54,363
Who has?

143
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:56,833
Raja Sahab!

144
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,469
Who Raja Sahab?

145
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,039
How can he demolish Ajanta?

146
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:05,280
Ajanta is the property of this town.

147
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:07,774
Whole town is with him.

148
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,179
But why?

149
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:11,780
What will he get by
getting Ajanta demolished?

150
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:16,319
Mall something,
shops and all.

151
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:18,188
Mall?
- Yes.

152
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:20,359
Shopping mall?
- Yes exactly.

153
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,328
Raja Sahab has decided that

154
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:28,601
he will build a shopping mall for
the people after demolishing Ajanta.

155
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,198
Who is Raja Sahab to decide that?

156
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:35,975
His father used to be the prince
of this area before Independence.

157
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,275
He's a Member of Parliament.

158
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,977
He's also done some education
from abroad.

159
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:42,212
Now he has also won
the elections. So...

160
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:45,484
I will go and meet him.

161
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:48,490
Don't worry.

162
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,160
Ajanta will be safe.

163
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,671
I need to see Mr. Uday Singh,
I have an appointment.

164
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:11,744
Is Mr. MP coming or not?

165
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,610
Not MP, it's Raja Sahab.

166
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:21,481
Have you told him
that I'm waiting?

167
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,256
Have you told him
that I'm waiting?

168
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:28,465
Uncle, it's burnt.

169
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:31,058
I've been waiting here
for 20 minutes.

170
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,730
Hey, can I offer you some pizza?

171
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,070
No, will you call your
father, please?

172
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,037
I'm afraid he can't come.

173
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,671
It has been 20 minutes
since I'm waiting here.

174
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:44,874
And it has been 3 years
since he's passed away.

175
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,246
I'm here with meet Raja Uday Singh,

176
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,414
MP of this area.

177
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,753
You have.
Uday.

178
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:54,655
You?

179
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,961
I don't look like my father
but still I'm Raja.

180
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,162
Pizza?
- No thanks.

181
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:02,865
I'm Diya Srivastav.

182
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:05,334
Have a seat please.

183
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,763
I've made it myself.
- Oh great.

184
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,274
So what can I do for you?

185
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,603
I've come from New York.

186
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,703
It's obvious.

187
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:21,408
I wanted to talk about
Ajanta Theatre with you.

188
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,579
Right, those ruins?

189
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,917
That's not ruins.

190
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:30,652
You are not political. Right?

191
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,324
I'm a dancer.
I'm a choreographer.

192
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:35,195
From New York.

193
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:40,365
All I want to say is that place
is not for shopping.

194
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,501
It's for theatre.

195
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:50,438
So, when did the theatre
held there last time?

196
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,449
Madam

197
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,544
Many Non-resident Indians come
here every years.

198
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:59,522
They do the welfare work for a
couple of months and go back.

199
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:02,888
You too do the same.

200
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,690
Don't interfere with the town plans.

201
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:08,358
So you'll remove the heritage of
this town for the sake of your mall.

202
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:10,060
Without thinking and understanding anything.

203
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:18,708
The day when people start feeding with
heritage, I'll let you run the theater.

204
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,609
Till then let me do
it in my own way.

205
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,312
Anything else I can do for you?
- So is it all about feeding people?

206
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:27,650
Don't they need anything else?

207
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:32,579
Being together, having fun, To have
happiness of doing something together.

208
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,889
Does that happen at your Ajanta?

209
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,325
It used to be.

210
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:45,460
If people aren't coming to the theater,
that tells they don't want to come.

211
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:48,996
What if I bring people in?

212
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,808
I will bring people in Ajanta.

213
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:55,709
All of Shamli.

214
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,907
I'll get my team from New York.

215
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,415
Best dancers, stage designers.

216
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:00,781
Lights, music,

217
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:03,685
I'll do India's biggest show ever.

218
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,323
No problem.

219
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:06,324
Then?

220
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:07,325
What?

221
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:08,326
Then what?

222
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:09,327
What do you mean?

223
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:12,524
You and your team will go back
to New York after one show.

224
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,456
Only remain will be the ruins of Ajanta.

225
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:19,198
The way it has always been.

226
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,602
Yes, it would seem ruins to you.

227
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,766
What could be expected from you.

228
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:27,835
A person who's today's foreign
educated MP.

229
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,710
You think you're damn good.
Don't you?

230
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,480
You think you know everything.

231
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,919
You can...
You can change the world.

232
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,724
I'll make you a deal.

233
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,225
Do you want do a show?

234
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,063
Do it.

235
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,798
But not with the people from New York.

236
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:55,531
But with the people of Shamli.

237
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,404
Every dancer.

238
00:27:58,476 --> 00:27:59,534
Actor.

239
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:00,635
Singer

240
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,009
should be from Shamli.

241
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:04,379
If you succeed in doing a
show like that,

242
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,708
Ajanta is yours.

243
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,381
What?
All excitement gone?

244
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:20,156
All right.

245
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:21,755
This show will be held.

246
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,063
And it will be the way you asked.

247
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:26,300
Not with the people from New York.

248
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,362
Here, with the people of Shamli.

249
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:31,940
Every singer, actor, dancer...

250
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,272
will be from Shamli.

251
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,446
Think again, demolition
is in 2 months.

252
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:39,278
2 months are too much.

253
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,113
Ok.

254
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:43,478
Done.

255
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:45,615
But you'll loose.

256
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,715
I've never lost till today.

257
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:51,154
I too have never been defeated.

258
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,253
No problem.

259
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,798
Your first defeat would
be a gift from me.

260
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,325
See you in two months.

261
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:02,071
Listen.

262
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:04,471
You haven't eaten pizza.

263
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,848
How will you do this show?

264
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:15,177
In a town that people even
don't want to hear your name.

265
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,220
How will you do that show?

266
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,690
I'm sorry child.

267
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:23,758
I have to tell you
what's truth.

268
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,190
You should be wise.

269
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,528
If I wasn't wise, I wouldn't
have come here.

270
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,694
And what's wise in what's
going to happen to this town?

271
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,830
Forget this town.
This town has never missed you.

272
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:36,203
And yet you're trying
to be a relative to this town.

273
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,935
I am a relative of this town.

274
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,806
No matter what people think.

275
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,403
But this is the same town
and people are same too.

276
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:45,216
We'll see.

277
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:47,749
This town..

278
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:49,343
and the people of this town.

279
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:52,418
I will definitely get the show held.

280
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,424
And that with these very people.

281
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:56,553
You will see that.

282
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:03,727
Let's go home.

283
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,100
Coming, coming.

284
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:46,100
If you were a bit more late...

285
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:49,271
I would have called for
another maid.

286
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,939
I'm Diya.

287
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:58,422
This used to be my house.

288
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:02,483
We used to live here
many years ago.

289
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:05,622
But it's our home, we bought
it from Mr. Srivastav.

290
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:07,596
Yes, he was my father...

291
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,563
He is...

292
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:11,933
You...

293
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:14,399
You...

294
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:15,803
will you have some water?

295
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:17,205
I'll have some coke.

296
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:18,837
Shut up Radha.

297
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:21,469
Yes, why not child.

298
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,070
Come, she's so sweet.
Please come.

299
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:27,915
Room on rent?

300
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,510
I suggest you give her the room.

301
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:34,884
I hope you will not
claim your right on this house.

302
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,221
No, absolutely not.

303
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:39,058
When you've purchased this house,
who am I to claim my right.

304
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,495
Absolutely right.

305
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,761
Look.

306
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:49,932
You'll give an affidavit on Rs. 20
stamp paper that

307
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,703
you'll stay here only on rent

308
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:53,505
and will never claim any rights
on this house.

309
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,409
3 copies, one for your filing.

310
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,640
No problem.

311
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:01,612
Breakfast, luck, dinner, what we
eat will be served to you.

312
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,017
And drinking water will be for free.

313
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,146
Absolutely free.
- Will it be safe?

314
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:07,222
No problems.

315
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:09,382
And no gentlemen in the house please.

316
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:11,518
I hope you don't have
many male friends.

317
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,154
I'm not that lucky.

318
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:15,665
Luck is to be opened if you want.

319
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:19,032
There's a key to every heart.
If you try you can find it.

320
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,768
Ok the deal is done. I'm getting
late for official work.

321
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,834
Have a good day and good luck.
- Good day.

322
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:35,046
I've heard a lot about you.

323
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,818
Not something good.

324
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,180
It's not like that.

325
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:43,121
People would say one thing or
the other. It's their job.

326
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,371
It's her.

327
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:31,339
Who?

328
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:36,202
Her.

329
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,043
Where did she come from?

330
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:41,108
I used to know her father.

331
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,278
That poor fellow had
to leave the town.

332
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,289
She put the whole town
on fire with her dance.

333
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:50,589
She's a proved heart breaker.

334
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:53,095
Now what she's going to do?

335
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,325
What else?
She'll dance, it's written.

336
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,766
If she'll dance, what's so big.

337
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:03,432
Sir, whenever Diya dances,
everyone goes mad.

338
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,533
I will definitely go to
see her dance.

339
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:09,572
Mom, what have you
put on the wall?

340
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,406
Sugar!

341
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:15,384
My teacher used to say...

342
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:16,920
if you want to invite flies,
you must have to put some sweet.

343
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:20,856
Mom, everyone in this
town hates you.

344
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:22,722
No

345
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,762
Not everyone.
Come on, let's go.

346
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:25,693
Where?

347
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:29,657
To someone who loves me the most.

348
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,674
Are you being shy to hug me?

349
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:46,142
How are you Diya?

350
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:49,619
I'm fine.

351
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:52,450
How are you?

352
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,253
I'm good.

353
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:57,383
What brought you here?

354
00:34:58,162 --> 00:34:59,652
What brought me here?

355
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,370
Farooq, she's Diya,
Mr. Srivastav's daughter.

356
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,169
He's my husband.

357
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:17,708
So, you are Diya.

358
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,107
She's my daughter, Radha.

359
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,253
Say hello.

360
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:25,248
In Hindi

361
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,188
Hi child.

362
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:29,590
It's ok, we too understand
English a bit.

363
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,228
Your husband?
- He was...

364
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:34,325
They are divorced.

365
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:35,296
They what?

366
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:36,492
They're divorced.

367
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:44,701
Actually...

368
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:49,007
People who run once, always
keep on running.

369
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:53,241
Shall we go?

370
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,561
Ok Diya, I have some work to do.

371
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,969
Is there anyone else in this
town who loves you?

372
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:36,185
Come let's dance, Shamli.

373
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,455
Come let's play, Shamli.

374
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:57,212
Sit down and keep quite.

375
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:02,419
Thank you very much.

376
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:05,249
That you have come to Ajanta.

377
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:08,257
And raised the pride of
your own Ajanta Theater.

378
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:11,021
For that millions of congratulations.

379
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:13,086
Applause.

380
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:18,125
I invited you all here
not only for the show.

381
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:20,631
As you all are aware

382
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:24,265
that in your town Ajanta Theatre
is going through a difficult time.

383
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:29,109
Administration is going to demolish
Ajanta Theatre to build some shops.

384
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,310
You tell me, is it right thing to do?

385
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:35,511
Just do another dance if you can, we
are not interested in your lecture.

386
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,985
I understand what's your
opinion about me.

387
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,688
But it's not about me.

388
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,955
It's a fight.

389
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,724
That people of Shamli will
fight together.

390
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,527
That's why after 2 months
from now...

391
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,727
A show about Laila Majnu
will be held in Ajanta

392
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:53,770
A show that...

393
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:56,396
no one had ever seen or heard
till now.

394
00:42:56,473 --> 00:43:00,637
Because performers of this show
would be from all of you.

395
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,804
She wants to make us jokers too.

396
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,782
From tomorrow, we all will take out
one hour from our work.

397
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,715
To do the rehearsal of this show.

398
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,219
We will show the whole world.

399
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:14,485
That Shamli has the potential
of music, dance and art.

400
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:16,492
She's wasting our time.

401
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,289
One of you will play "Laila"

402
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:19,693
Someone will play "Majnu"

403
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,731
Someone will play Laila's mother.

404
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,494
and someone will play Majnu's friend.

405
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:26,127
If you're playing Laila then I'll
play Majnu.

406
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:27,363
Agreed?

407
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,472
They are insulting her.

408
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:35,235
And that way by doing the
hard work for 2 months.

409
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:37,576
We will show the anti-Ajanta people

410
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:40,276
that until this sun and moon are there

411
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:42,876
Shamli will still have Ajanta.

412
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,545
Not in good way.

413
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:03,563
Nice, this town really
loves you a lot.

414
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:32,126
So have you understood?

415
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:35,928
You've got the answer from Shamli.

416
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:40,133
You've also saved your two months.

417
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,438
Not bad.

418
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:44,473
When are you going back?

419
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,417
Who told you that I'm going back?

420
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:50,218
Why? What's more to happen?

421
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,512
Shamli will gather
and till show will run.

422
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:55,623
And you'll watch it too.

423
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:57,792
I think you'll enjoy it.

424
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:05,859
So you won't listen.

425
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:08,460
I will, if you do.

426
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,365
Best of luck Ms. Diya, I think
you need it.

427
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:15,969
Maybe you'll need it, Raja Sahab.

428
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:19,843
That was nasty.

429
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:21,441
It's a fight.

430
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:22,815
Fights are nasty.

431
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:30,484
You dance very well.

432
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:31,923
I know.

433
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:52,649
What do you think?

434
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:55,977
Will her show run?

435
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:01,590
Why do you come here?
To make me angry.

436
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:06,529
That's my job.

437
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,530
I'm a policeman.

438
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,727
I have to keep the conditions
of people's hearts.

439
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,630
So, you will never go there. Right?

440
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:18,503
To Ajanta.

441
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:23,176
Even if my shoe goes there,
you can change my name.

442
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:29,881
The search for the performers of
Laila Majnu in Ajanta has started.

443
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:33,647
If you want to become an actor.

444
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:37,421
Make yourself look good
and get yourself ready.

445
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:40,952
Come tomorrow morning at 10
at Ajanta.

446
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:42,396
Come for sure.

447
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:45,766
They're ruining Ajanta.
- What?

448
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:24,904
What are you doing?

449
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:54,894
What are you doing?
Are you mad?

450
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:56,098
Why are you doing this?

451
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:58,437
You should have asked us
before doing this dance and all.

452
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:00,135
Get aside.

453
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,973
Don't you have any manners?

454
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:02,943
Where're those Laila Majnu?

455
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:05,140
Where's petrol?

456
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,775
He's gone to bring that.

457
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:10,718
Bring the firewood here.

458
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:13,119
Finish this Ajanta or whatever it is.

459
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:19,486
Since you were a child...
I even know your father.

460
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:27,999
Look what they're doing?
- Don't stop them.

461
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,129
What happened?

462
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,331
Didn't you see him?
- What?

463
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,898
Majnu, he's right there.

464
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,740
But they're breaking the stage.
- We had to break the stage anyway.

465
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:39,375
It's good that we will save
the charges to break it.

466
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:41,713
But have you seen him?

467
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:46,587
Are you mad?

468
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:49,455
Doctor, Majnu is right there.

469
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:51,118
Let's talk to him.

470
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,392
You're out of your mind.

471
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:57,126
Hey Vidya, just finish this.

472
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:00,427
What's your name?

473
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:01,664
What will you do with my name?

474
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,603
Go away.

475
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:07,872
Hey, all of you go away from here.
Or we'll break your legs.

476
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:10,972
Will you play "Majnu"?

477
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:14,882
You must have participated
in plays in school etc.

478
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,382
You're educated, right?

479
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:21,581
Old man, take care of her.

480
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:23,421
Or I'll get you both cremated right here.

481
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:26,053
Let's go Diya.

482
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:32,325
But something you must have done.
Like Twinkle Twinkle Little Star,

483
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:35,098
Ba Ba Black Sheep, etc.

484
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,865
Why have you guys stopped.
Keep on breaking.

485
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:39,806
Get a drink for him.

486
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:41,104
He must be tired.

487
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,473
How much you paid
for the haircut?

488
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:44,445
What's this?

489
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:47,576
Is it funny to you?

490
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:51,485
O Madam! Listen carefully.

491
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:53,686
I won't repeat that.

492
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:57,458
The dance culture that you brought
from America.

493
00:49:58,095 --> 00:49:59,460
We won't allow that to run here.

494
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:01,463
Who brought that from America.

495
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:03,226
I took that from here to America.

496
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:06,501
You can't find Majnu's like you in America.

497
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,435
So you're still the same.

498
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:09,335
Hello Choudhry Sahab.

499
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:10,373
Hello son.

500
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:13,602
I knew your father.

501
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:16,705
I saw what you did to him.

502
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,209
I'm also watching what you're
doing now.

503
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:21,011
It's not acceptable in Shamli.

504
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:24,212
Choudhry Sahab, so these boys are yours.

505
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:25,914
Haven't you heard what I said?

506
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:28,651
Can we talk in private for two minutes?

507
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:29,851
Just two minutes.

508
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:32,224
Break it.
You keep on breaking.

509
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:33,990
What happened to the drink?

510
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:34,962
Please come.

511
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,932
What's this rubbish?
- Please come.

512
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:43,101
I've heard that elections are
coming and you're contesting?

513
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:45,300
So?
- I want you to win.

514
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,536
Will I loose if you don't want?

515
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:49,738
No sir, your enemies must loose.

516
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:51,940
There must a be a lot.

517
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:54,417
I know how to deal with enemies.

518
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:57,643
But you don't have an issue
to raise this time.

519
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:58,278
Why?

520
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:00,482
That Uday Singh has left no issue to raise.

521
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,184
Water! In every home.

522
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:03,556
It's there whenever you open tap.

523
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:05,458
Electricity! Always on.

524
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:07,394
He didn't even left the roads.

525
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:09,830
He builds them before the break.

526
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,562
Hindu Muslims are living in peace already.

527
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:15,036
Even the college is already
running well.

528
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:16,663
You don't have to worry about me.

529
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,367
I know how to raise an issue.

530
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:19,306
Put it on fire.

531
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:25,172
Choudhry Sahab, issue is right there.

532
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,045
You yourself are ignoring it.

533
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:28,345
What issue?

534
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,682
This...
Ajanta.

535
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:33,754
This? A dance place?

536
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:35,314
No Sir,

537
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:38,759
Art, culture and music.

538
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:40,524
It's our country's heritage.

539
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:44,328
Will there shops be built on
the ruins of our heritage?

540
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:46,665
That too on the state land?

541
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:50,496
Our heritage is being attacked
and you're just watching.

542
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:53,002
No.

543
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:54,873
Please have it.
- I can't watch that.

544
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,813
Sir, you have the issue in hand,
and election is coming.

545
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:00,349
Let the kite fly.

546
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:02,112
It will be Ajanta issue.

547
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:08,454
But what do you want?
- Majnu.

548
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:09,492
What?

549
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:18,031
Diya.
- What?

550
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:19,796
Given, Majnu is given.

551
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:32,945
Shamli is shaken
as we've found our Majnu.

552
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:38,181
Cleric's son is going to perform
as Majnu.

553
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:43,557
Coming to entertain you the young
man Imran Pathaan.

554
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:48,758
And he's looking for his Laila.

555
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:14,055
It's not fair. You challenge first
then you cheat.

556
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:15,955
Do I cheat?

557
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,288
Liar.

558
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,692
I will beat your like anything.

559
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:21,128
You start calling you mom
as your aunt.

560
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:24,224
What did you say?
- You'll hear better if I slap you.

561
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:26,394
She abused.

562
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:29,233
I didn't

563
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:31,171
No I didn't

564
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:32,538
That was an abuse.

565
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:35,237
That was a full abuse.
She said mother...

566
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:36,904
I said mom as your aunt.

567
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,777
That could have been a
misunderstanding.

568
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:41,442
It couldn't be an abuse.

569
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:51,816
You keep on playing in street.

570
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:54,921
Imran has already become
Majnu for a play in Ajanta.

571
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:55,692
Why?

572
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:57,460
How would I know?

573
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:00,434
All girls of Shamli are ready
to be his Laila.

574
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:03,028
No one can be Imran's Laila.

575
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:05,267
I will put Ginger powder in their nose.

576
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:07,599
So you love him too much.

577
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:09,076
Should I rip my heart open?

578
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:11,238
No, this acting won't work.

579
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:12,144
Then?

580
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:15,150
Dance is required.
Laila must know how to dance.

581
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:17,809
Dance?

582
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:20,048
Not even my lice had ever danced.

583
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:12,330
Next

584
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:45,762
Stop

585
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:47,932
That's enough.

586
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:51,538
I already knew, it will be me.

587
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:56,041
Go home and help your
mom in house chores.

588
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:45,143
You should play in the street.
You can't be Imran's Laila.

589
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:50,054
I will hit you with my shoe,
you'll become an old man.

590
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:53,987
Tabrez No. 1

591
00:58:58,768 --> 00:59:00,736
I'm Tabrez, Laila's brother.

592
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:22,719
I'm brother-in-law,
I won't give you bad advice.

593
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:26,159
At least you get yourself insured.

594
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:30,924
I got Tabrez.

595
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:33,864
Him?
How he'll play Tabrez?

596
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:37,373
I don't need a gangster.
I need a brother.

597
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:39,233
He will definitely play Tabrez.

598
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:06,212
Why are you stopping?

599
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:09,183
She wants to be Laila's mom.

600
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:12,056
Really?
Will you do the part of Laila's mom?

601
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:14,390
No

602
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,027
Am I really good?

603
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:21,761
Can I do it?

604
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:23,635
Why not?

605
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:28,204
What are you doing in my house?

606
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:30,344
She can't play any Laila's mom?

607
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:32,277
Why?
- Why?

608
01:02:32,348 --> 01:02:34,248
Because I'm saying.

609
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:37,286
You see, I'm a responsible
government officer.

610
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:41,050
If my wife plays in a show,
what my respect will be in office?

611
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:47,159
He's right. If I play in the show
he'll loose his respect.

612
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,592
If I play in the street,
he'll loose his respect.

613
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:54,124
If I eat something in market,
he'll loose his respect.

614
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:58,196
Even if I breathe, he'll
loose his respect.

615
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,299
Because there are only two
people who live in our house.

616
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:02,007
Him and his respect.

617
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:07,808
And I?
I'm just another file in his life.

618
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:10,352
He can open it and close it
whenever he wants.

619
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:15,079
My life is full of boredom.

620
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:20,118
Because I've married to world's
most boring person.

621
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:46,311
I had to say something to you.

622
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:49,588
Whatever happened today at
my home because of you...

623
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:51,858
No, let me speak.

624
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:58,032
Because you my wife denied to
follow my instructions for the 1st time.

625
01:04:02,104 --> 01:04:04,402
For the first in the 10 years..

626
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:12,547
it got known to everyone that not
everything is fine in my marital life.

627
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:19,046
For the first time in my life...

628
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:24,592
my wife called me as the most
boring person in the world.

629
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,557
That was all because of you.

630
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:34,960
It's was right, whatever happened.

631
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:38,301
I am a boring person.

632
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,504
But I don't want to remain
a boring person.

633
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,074
Specially not in front of my wife.

634
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:54,219
So I've come to apply for post
in your cultural program.

635
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:59,625
You were saying there are
some vacancies still vacant.

636
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:05,858
Help me change myself from
being bored in front of my wife.

637
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:09,863
It's my humble request to you.

638
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:17,141
If you let me join your play without
telling my wife...

639
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:20,681
so I will...

640
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:25,348
Just help me save my marriage.

641
01:05:26,155 --> 01:05:29,488
I've also brought it in writing.

642
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:34,221
Why not?

643
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:35,457
Thank you.

644
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:49,069
Shop's closed,
but the gate's opened.

645
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:51,375
Then get your daughter
wrap the gate.

646
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:53,240
Should I close the gate?

647
01:05:56,552 --> 01:05:58,383
There's not a single Laila
in whole of Shamli.

648
01:05:59,755 --> 01:06:00,983
What happened to Laila's father?

649
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:03,491
What about that Khalifa with a beard.

650
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:05,049
Who? From the Parsi Theater?

651
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:06,924
No way.

652
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:09,697
No Laila, no Laila's mom,

653
01:06:09,765 --> 01:06:10,561
no Laila's father...

654
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:13,193
You leave the worry of
Laila's father.

655
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:16,297
I've solved this problem.

656
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,437
I won't let you struggle alone.

657
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:24,144
For Laila's father, I will
be the perfect performer.

658
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:27,715
Why are you bothering sir?
We will find someone.

659
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,084
Why will you find someone
when you already have one.

660
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:32,313
Yes, why will we find someone

661
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:36,090
Perfect.

662
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:55,168
She's here again.
Why doesn't anyone stop her?

663
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:57,042
Who can stop her?

664
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:03,048
Listen, you can't play Laila.
Go home.

665
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:04,753
Why not?

666
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:06,845
You don't have that thing.

667
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:09,186
Why not?
Try me

668
01:07:09,258 --> 01:07:10,418
I have practiced everything.

669
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:13,593
Come here.
It's not about practice.

670
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:16,790
What we're looking for in
Laila, that's not in you.

671
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:17,890
Go

672
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:21,164
What are you saying Madam,
let me know what you're looking for.

673
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:22,704
I will bring it out.

674
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:24,304
What will you bring out?

675
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:26,701
Have looked at yourself?

676
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:29,040
You don't know how to speak, walk,
dance or sing?

677
01:07:29,111 --> 01:07:31,341
From what angle you look
like Laila?

678
01:07:31,981 --> 01:07:33,539
How dare you thought that
you could play Laila?

679
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:37,750
How dare I?

680
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:41,652
So now you'll decide
who can do what?

681
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:44,022
You will decide everything.

682
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:46,486
No matter if someone
lives or die.

683
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:51,125
Even if someone dies
out of love for someone.

684
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:55,166
Bring water.

685
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:56,226
Get up

686
01:08:03,846 --> 01:08:05,211
Why do you want to play Laila?

687
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:09,509
If I won't, someone else will.

688
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:13,681
If someone else will play.
Imran will fall for her.

689
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:15,155
Then what will I do?

690
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:18,385
He won't fall only by
playing Laila.

691
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:20,361
What if he does?

692
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:22,797
Do you love him that much?

693
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:25,425
His love is nothing compared to mine.

694
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:27,435
Does he know?

695
01:08:27,503 --> 01:08:29,698
How would he know,
he's just an ass.

696
01:08:29,805 --> 01:08:31,796
Should I tell him?

697
01:08:31,874 --> 01:08:34,638
No, I'll faint right now.

698
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:38,908
You won't tell him yet
you love him. How this will work?

699
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:41,814
That's the confusion I'm stuck in.

700
01:08:42,651 --> 01:08:46,178
So, you're here to get out
of this confusion.

701
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:50,021
Yes, or what else?

702
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:53,184
I was too stuck in a confusion
once like you.

703
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:55,221
Do you know what I did?

704
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:57,288
What?
- Exactly what you're doing?

705
01:08:58,067 --> 01:09:00,331
I did my best and forgotten everything.

706
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:02,962
Can you put your all strength in to it?

707
01:09:05,207 --> 01:09:08,199
Are you referring to play in the show?

708
01:09:09,411 --> 01:09:11,038
You'll have to work too hard.

709
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:13,081
I only know the hard work.

710
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,208
I'm not good at intellect.

711
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:17,582
Won't you give up in middle?

712
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:20,554
Those who love can't break.

713

but, the way from here I can
go blind

752
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:20,125
you have only one month left to
cross the way.

753
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:24,962
please do come at the show.

754
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,104
half of the city is still against you.

755
01:12:27,242 --> 01:12:28,402
and half is with me.

756
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:32,742
don't you say best of luck.

757
01:12:32,981 --> 01:12:34,448

762
01:13:20,295 --> 01:13:21,819
but it has nothing to do with you.

763
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:26,564

764
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:30,200

773
01:13:55,798 --> 01:13:57,322
Phuu is very old.

774
01:13:58,567 --> 01:14:01,730
I don't know, you are here that's
right or wrong

775
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:04,262
its in favor of Shamli or not.

776
01:14:05,307 --> 01:14:07,434
for me its good or bad?

777
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:11,576
but you are here, anyhow I am
with you.

778
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:22,680
my English has no leg, but if there's
a long way to go then nothing matters.

779
01:14:26,094 --> 01:14:31,191
Mohan what happen earlier, we
didn't even discuss about that.

780
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:33,860
I couldn't make to say sorry to you.

781
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:36,703
every thing went so fast.

782
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:43,405
but after what happen you are still
with me same as ever.

783
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,707
what kind of person you are?

784
01:14:49,718 --> 01:14:56,248
right now you are busy, so later,
and now we will meet often.

785
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:01,321
what going on Diya Gee back there?

786
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:03,995
nothing could happen without
you Mister Chaudry.

787
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:12,932
Laila, Majnu, what was in there love
that world has not forgotten yet?

788
01:15:13,876 --> 01:15:15,309
can anyone give me the answer?

789
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:24,916
people die in love nowadays too.

790
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:26,449
if love's the same.

791
01:15:27,322 --> 01:15:30,859
so Majnu can you die for someone
in love?

792
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:32,417
I can kill in love, should I ?

793
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:34,859
I can die, shall I?

794
01:15:34,997 --> 01:15:38,558
I know you can, that's why you
are Laila.

795
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:42,065
I can die in English too.

796
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:47,774
first time they meet in Mosque.

797
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:50,435
Laila was 5 and Majnu was 7 years old.

798
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:55,180
When little fight become huge love
they didn't even realize.

799
01:15:55,584 --> 01:16:01,716
love can happen, when, where or with
whom no one knows.

800
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:08,460
so Laila and Majnu fall for each other
Master punished Majnu, Laila get hurt.

801
01:16:08,797 --> 01:16:12,198
and when parents find out about this
it became boom.

802
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:19,540
yeah.. students should never act like
this.

803
01:16:20,142 --> 01:16:24,340
just because of this, they were
home, locked.

804
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:28,506
so sad those kids must have ruin,
like dead flowers.

805
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:33,451
you are the mother,
you can feel the pain of Laila.

806
01:16:33,855 --> 01:16:41,489
but your husband... daughter had forget
everything in love not him.

807
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:46,090
I would have slap her, and
lock her up.

808
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:50,568
no food, no nothing till Laila
come to normal.

809
01:16:50,973 --> 01:17:00,143
that's what happened, and your son
Tabrez helped you.

810
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:04,475
no.. no.. I didn't, why would
I come between them?

811
01:17:05,387 --> 01:17:08,618
you were brother, should have taking
care of the family pride.

812
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:19,095
people who harm them were there
own.

813
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:22,199
then?
then what they did?

814
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:26,165
the story is enough for today,

815
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:28,833
that's it... its very easy.

816
01:17:29,344 --> 01:17:33,576
every one move now, come tomorrow
at time.

817
01:17:33,915 --> 01:17:34,711
shall we move?

818
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:36,118
don't you want to dance?

819
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:37,585
what?

820
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:45,859
Mister Chaudry we have to show
this story on dancing show!

821
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:47,393
you are kidding?

822
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:54,395
I am not, you guys are.
because no one is ready for dance yet.

823
01:17:54,569 --> 01:17:59,199
why not, I dance from childhood,

824
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:00,603
Aerobics.

825
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:17,017
what are you doing Anokhi?
that's not the right way.

826
01:18:17,159 --> 01:18:19,423
hands up and leg in the side.

827
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:24,525
don't push.

828
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:39,610
what are you doing Majnu?

829
01:18:40,315 --> 01:18:43,773
I will die, but I wont dance.

830
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:48,854
you think they are dancing?
go die!

831
01:18:49,658 --> 01:18:54,254
what happen son?
dance!! dance!!

832
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:22,022
dogs and cats can become one
but they will never.

833
01:19:42,043 --> 01:19:57,448
you Jaylabi, you were against them
earlier, and now you were dancing.

834
01:19:58,093 --> 01:20:05,056
with the one who insulted your
feeling.

835
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:08,428
this show is not for her, its
for Shamli. try to understand.

836
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:19,879
what understand... you are Jaylabi.
say I am Jaylabi.

837
01:20:21,116 --> 01:20:27,544
this is clear he is Devdas in
Laila Majnu.

838
01:20:28,757 --> 01:20:30,691
drinking mine and making my
buzz off?

839
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:33,287
whole city has very limited thinking.

840
01:20:38,767 --> 01:20:54,775
think she will cook, I will serve, I will
be happy in own my small world.

841
01:20:56,818 --> 01:21:02,814
your sister in law. Diya, what else
one need in life. what you say?

842
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:09,620

843
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:18,639

people wont watch you.

844
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:25,240

01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:28,483
why are you interested in that
Mr. Mehta?

846
01:21:28,483 --> 01:21:30,713
mine.. or public's rate.

847
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:35,084
you mean to say, possibilities are less
do the Laila Majnu

848
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:37,191
so you think there is too much?
no.. no..

849
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:00,479

850
01:22:01,516 --> 01:22:02,380

851
01:22:02,717 --> 01:22:04,776
I told you to stay away from me.

852
01:22:05,186 --> 01:22:07,711
it cant be done if I am away,
I don't want to do it with you.

853
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:14,794
one minute... you guys don't dance like
one.

854
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,522

855
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:18,460
but you can be one heart.

856
01:22:22,637 --> 01:22:23,661

857
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:27,599

01:24:57,258 --> 01:24:58,316

886
01:24:59,661 --> 01:25:06,897
you look like witch..
pull you hair back.

887
01:25:07,702 --> 01:25:13,072
and what is all this, loose cloths,
its like cat is coming.

888
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:16,536
and jump in his arm.

889
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:18,275
I don't do this.

890
01:25:18,746 --> 01:25:26,084
don't lie, guys don't like the girls who
stick to them a lot.

891
01:25:28,156 --> 01:25:31,614
the more you go near him, he will
go away.

892
01:25:31,759 --> 01:25:32,783
but why?

893
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:35,358
he will run away.. guys are just like
that.

894
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:37,165
they are big fool.

895
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:41,761
yeah.. they are just like that,
from today you stay away from him.

896
01:25:42,003 --> 01:25:43,971
how far...

897
01:25:52,247 --> 01:25:55,444
till he don't talk to you, you
will not either.

898
01:25:55,683 --> 01:25:57,082
he wont talk ever.

899
01:25:57,218 --> 01:26:00,187
he will... for sure if you wont
talk to him.

900
01:26:01,089 --> 01:26:03,023
Laila did the same to Majnu

901
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:08,418
yeah.. Majnu was also a guy,
he worked hard to impress Laila.

902
01:26:08,696 --> 01:26:11,665
I will do the same, will he work
hard on me in front of everyone?

903
01:26:11,799 --> 01:26:12,993
you....

904
01:26:14,135 --> 01:26:20,165
that's why I am saying you get an other
Laila, I cant do all this.

905
01:26:20,642 --> 01:26:24,669
if he want to love, love me in
the straight line. or go to hell.

906
01:26:24,812 --> 01:26:30,341
Anokhi.... remember what you said..
no..!!

907
01:26:30,585 --> 01:26:32,610
in the middle of the way,
you wont dispirit

908
01:26:32,754 --> 01:26:36,057
I didn't know dogs would follow
in the way.

909
01:26:36,057 --> 01:26:37,081
you said it or not?

910
01:26:38,927 --> 01:26:39,791
yeah I said.

911
01:26:41,062 --> 01:26:44,088
you know why Imran has not become
Majnu yet?

912
01:26:44,232 --> 01:26:45,199
why?

913
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:48,234
because you are become Laila yet.

914
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:53,930
Become Laila, Anokhi, the one he
die to talk.

915
01:26:54,742 --> 01:26:55,936
then he will become Majnu.

916
01:26:57,312 --> 01:26:59,177
this is very difficult work.

917
01:26:59,948 --> 01:27:06,012
if you do it as work its difficult,
do it as love, it will be easy

918
01:27:07,989 --> 01:27:09,718
did you also loved like that?

919
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:18,088
no.. I did like you, that time I
couldn't find any Diya.

920
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:20,496
but I found Diya.

921
01:31:50,104 --> 01:31:56,043
I also wanted to learn it but, just
because of business I lost the image

922
01:31:56,177 --> 01:31:59,010
learn it now, business is all set now.

923
01:31:59,146 --> 01:32:00,170
your company is building mall.

924
01:32:00,314 --> 01:32:07,686
but I heard something else you gave
your word to me, but now its change?

925
01:32:09,056 --> 01:32:12,856
its not my words its government's.

926
01:32:13,661 --> 01:32:17,153
if ever mall build at Ajanta's place,
your company going to build it.

927
01:32:17,298 --> 01:32:19,960
if build !! what if it never build?

928
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:23,632
you think it wont build?

929
01:32:23,804 --> 01:32:25,669
no... I think the mall should build.

930
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:31,845
you are the owner you will decide
if it build or not.

931
01:32:32,313 --> 01:32:35,942
not owner, I am M.P. Mr. Farooq
there's a little difference.

932
01:32:37,018 --> 01:32:41,887
but as an M.P. I think mall should
build and its good for Shamli.

933
01:32:43,824 --> 01:32:46,657
what is this nonsense Laila Majnu?

934
01:32:46,994 --> 01:32:52,899
you think some girl from America come here
plan show, that effect on government?

935
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:56,867
then, either you are overestimating her,
or you are underestimating me.

936
01:32:57,004 --> 01:33:03,432
I can never underestimate you,
that's why I am giving you an offer.

937
01:33:06,247 --> 01:33:14,177
both of us want the same,
lets do work together.

938
01:33:16,457 --> 01:33:22,020
world has changed, some one is giving
me share from my own family land.

939
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:34,039
no.. no.. I didn't mean that.
who am I to give you share.

940
01:33:35,142 --> 01:33:37,110
I mean lets work together.

941
01:33:42,516 --> 01:33:45,542
if you don't like what I said,
then I must leave it.

942
01:33:48,723 --> 01:33:53,319
I wont go back, from the words I gave
to you or to them.

943
01:33:53,561 --> 01:33:58,430
Shamli need Ajanta or Shopping Mall,
that's public decision.

944
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:01,267
and public decision will be the
government's decision.

945
01:34:02,570 --> 01:34:07,598
well if you listen to me, leave it alone,
its a matter of only 15 days.

946
01:34:07,942 --> 01:34:12,538
the show is on, you should also
have fun.

947
01:34:14,915 --> 01:34:23,550
or if you really want to buy something
buy stone, bricks.. you will be pleased.

948
01:34:26,594 --> 01:34:28,789
you are getting this wrong.

949
01:34:29,030 --> 01:34:33,933
how to treat with wrong thing
are told us in childhood

950
01:34:38,873 --> 01:34:40,135
you wanted to learn this?

951
01:34:40,374 --> 01:34:46,745
yeah will learn it...
not today may be later.

952
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:57,150

its there grandfather's kingdom

953
01:35:02,997 --> 01:35:04,487
have some food.

954
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:11,536
he didn't earn anything himself,
and trying to teach me.

955
01:35:13,407 --> 01:35:19,346
he don't understand my importance,
businessmen are ruling the world now.

956
01:35:21,315 --> 01:35:23,408
they are vast people.

957
01:35:23,551 --> 01:35:27,578
what vast.. who are vast people,
what they have done?

958
01:35:30,558 --> 01:35:35,962
at least we are doing something
in a constrictive way.

959
01:35:38,532 --> 01:35:40,124
now I get permission from the people
to build mall.

960
01:35:45,206 --> 01:35:46,935
people wanted to build mall.

961
01:35:47,074 --> 01:35:51,443
people don't want then mall wont built?
should I do business with people will.

962
01:35:53,781 --> 01:35:57,512
mall will be built what ever happened.

963
01:36:03,090 --> 01:36:10,053

think you wont say no? right?

964
01:36:11,365 --> 01:36:12,627

968
01:37:00,181 --> 01:37:01,546
90 out of 100.

01:37:03,584 --> 01:37:08,681
where you guys are going?

970
01:37:16,163 --> 01:37:17,926

971
01:37:20,434 --> 01:37:22,994
that couple is worst

972
01:37:23,137 --> 01:37:25,662
they come late night and
sleep in the day.

973
01:37:26,974 --> 01:37:29,636

01:37:44,458 --> 01:37:50,090
that's very strange story,
I can not understand that Majnu.

978
01:37:51,966 --> 01:37:58,895
did this really happen, some one fall
in love... just fall.

979
01:38:00,207 --> 01:38:04,803
only lucky people fall for love.

980
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:12,312
bullshit !! I don't believe in this,
its all books material.

981
01:38:12,753 --> 01:38:15,119
did any one go mad in love?

982
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:19,559
why, what... stick to some one
without any interest.

983
01:38:19,693 --> 01:38:25,529
he cry you cry, he got hut you feel
the pain.. or if he is sick you run

984
01:38:26,367 --> 01:38:27,527
that's bullshit !!

985
01:38:28,502 --> 01:38:29,093
what?

986
01:38:31,238 --> 01:38:34,674
why its light so unwise, where
did you get this from?

987
01:38:34,808 --> 01:38:38,300
that's Mehmood Meeyan's, people put
there lights in every marriage.

988
01:38:38,779 --> 01:38:42,408
don't mass Doctor we don't need
marriage lighting. Ramleela come here.

989

997
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:41,738
many girls can get easily, but

999
01:39:51,285 --> 01:39:52,616

1008
01:40:37,231 --> 01:40:43,795
don't hide any thing, who is she
an artist or something else?

1009
01:40:45,072 --> 01:40:47,666
actually Diya has her own choice

1010
01:40:48,909 --> 01:40:51,969
speak openly everyone here
is our own.

1011
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:54,547
she never listen to anyone

1012
01:40:56,550 --> 01:41:02,546
artist are modern but she is extra
modern she was with some white man.

1013
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:05,450
after that she run away without telling
parents.

1014
01:41:05,692 --> 01:41:09,822
yeah we heard about it but
is it true Najma Gee?

1015
01:41:12,933 --> 01:41:21,170
yeah she was corrupt, that's
why her parents move from city.

1016
01:41:24,645 --> 01:41:28,342
and you were saying you will take
kids to her show? strange.

1017

01:41:36,523 --> 01:41:41,825
if it went well that's good, but if
goes wrong every thing will be finished.

1020
01:41:41,962 --> 01:41:44,157
people are with Ajanta Mr. Farooq.

1021
01:41:45,966 --> 01:41:48,958

this is life, not drama, now
I have come to know this.

1048
01:44:02,469 --> 01:44:05,734
you are gone insane, you donkey.

1049
01:44:05,872 --> 01:44:12,277
you are gone insane, what a politics,
you left us alone?

1050
01:44:15,282 --> 01:44:19,912

I wont come. I said it already.

1051
01:44:56,523 --> 01:45:06,524
leave him...!!I eave him...!!

1052
01:45:50,944 --> 01:45:55,847
by the way Laila did well today,
she was acting like (Jhansi ki Rani)

1053
01:45:56,249 --> 01:46:00,185
when they were on Imran she jumped
on them I thought she will kill them.

1054
01:46:00,554 --> 01:46:03,489
she is Laila that's why, she has
to protect Majnu.

1055
01:46:03,724 --> 01:46:07,683
if show must go on then what we will
do about the there role?

1056
01:46:08,128 --> 01:46:16,194
waist of time, we don't have much
time. I am telling you it is the end.

1057
01:46:16,336 --> 01:46:20,033
and saw that Mr. Chaudry,
suddenly changed!!

1058
01:46:20,574 --> 01:46:26,410
I know how is changed, he is not
changed he has sold.

1059
01:46:27,180 --> 01:46:29,916
Mr. Farooq had bought him in
Rs. 5,000,000.

1060
01:46:29,916 --> 01:46:30,382
what !!

1061
01:46:30,617 --> 01:46:35,554
the mall he wants to build that's for
his pride and business.

1062
01:46:35,689 --> 01:46:37,680
they don't want to start Ajanta
again.

1063
01:46:39,192 --> 01:46:43,925
he and his man are encouraging
people again Diya Didi.

1064
01:46:44,064 --> 01:46:46,225
are people fool? what ever he says
they will believe?

1065
01:46:46,366 --> 01:46:51,201
no him, Najma Bibi Gee is saying.
what? what is she saying?

1066
01:46:51,338 --> 01:46:54,273
its better if you don't here it,
but she is Diya's childhood friend.

1067
01:47:18,598 --> 01:47:34,071
its for you Najma, you gave me something
which was sleeping from my hand

1068
01:47:35,482 --> 01:47:40,943
you are priceless gift from me.

1069
01:47:43,857 --> 01:47:45,119
from where I got you.

1070
01:47:55,001 --> 01:47:56,559
yeah... Mr. Chaudry whets the news?

1071
01:47:57,637 --> 01:48:00,037
what happen did you find anyone?

1072
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:09,448
on one wants to come and even they
were stopping me to come here.

1073
01:48:09,583 --> 01:48:12,074
Najma is liar are spoiling it.

1074
01:48:12,752 --> 01:48:16,017
Chaudry's guys come out openly,
now who would come from people.

1075
01:48:16,189 --> 01:48:16,746
I am going!

1076
01:48:16,890 --> 01:48:23,796
no.. no one will go, you were right,
do not dream what will never happen.

1077
01:48:24,431 --> 01:48:34,807
who was mine in this city? people are
right I will go back to America after show

1078
01:48:35,642 --> 01:48:46,041
that's why who ever is supporting me,
will not be able to stay in Shamli.

1079
01:48:47,387 --> 01:48:51,414
and now I am not allow to
force any one.

1080
01:48:52,926 --> 01:48:56,020
the one who want to leave me
go right now.

1081
01:48:57,898 --> 01:48:59,456
I wont have any complain.

1082
01:49:01,735 --> 01:49:03,566
I am not leaving.!

1083
01:49:03,703 --> 01:49:07,764
I don't think any one wants to leave,
Diya Gee lets do rehearsals.

1084
01:49:07,908 --> 01:49:09,603
but who will be the Laila's Mother?

1085
01:49:09,910 --> 01:49:29,923
me. I know I am not suppose to be
here, but its between me and Diya

1086
01:49:36,136 --> 01:49:38,001
I should have know what will happen.

1087
01:49:38,605 --> 01:49:50,676
what and where I said, I wont lie,
what ever you heard its true.

1088
01:49:54,020 --> 01:50:01,517
you are always brave and I am coward

1089
01:50:03,163 --> 01:50:08,226
I have spend whole my life to please
others heart.

1090
01:50:10,303 --> 01:50:15,866
whom heart's who already gave
his heart to business.

1091
01:50:17,510 --> 01:50:25,281
but when I have come to know this,
all my scarcity went away.

1092
01:50:31,224 --> 01:50:44,763
its been years since I dance and live,
teach me how to dance once again.

1093
01:50:47,374 --> 01:50:49,569
teach me to live Diya once again.

1094
01:51:01,721 --> 01:51:08,058
now my friends are with me, city will
see the show and break there showoff.

1095
01:51:14,567 --> 01:51:18,401

for two months.

1096
01:51:18,638 --> 01:51:27,171
artist from you people are ready to
bring the story of Laila Majnu

1097
01:51:27,313 --> 01:51:30,339
tonight is the night for the
Shamli's fortune.

1098
01:51:30,817 --> 01:51:37,518
Your coming to see the show
will decide the fate of all of us

1099
01:51:38,058 --> 01:51:42,927
So tonight if anyone comes or not

1100
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:46,556
There will be a show on Laila
Majnu at Ajanta, tonight

1101
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:55,669
This night will decide that if there are
Laila and Majnu in the hearts of Shamli.

1102
01:51:56,176 --> 01:51:57,734
Lets go, that's enough

1103
01:51:58,144 --> 01:51:59,702
She has gone insane.

1104
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:09,212
Anything could happen
in the town tonight

1105
01:52:09,289 --> 01:52:10,449
What has to be done sir?

1106
01:52:10,523 --> 01:52:11,512
Duty

1107
01:52:11,591 --> 01:52:14,116
None should be stopped if they
want to go Ajanta

1108
01:52:14,194 --> 01:52:17,061
And none should be dragged
who don't want to go Ajanta

1109
01:52:17,130 --> 01:52:19,064
That's it.

1110
01:52:23,303 --> 01:52:28,536
You said it yourself teacher that art
doesn't need town, town needs art.

1111
01:52:29,976 --> 01:52:32,137
Today art needs the town

1112
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:36,574
Will Shamli come tonight.
Will it?

1113
01:52:37,884 --> 01:52:39,613
Diya, come quick.

1114
01:52:41,521 --> 01:52:42,681
Come see.

1115
01:52:42,756 --> 01:52:45,691
What to see, I know

1116
01:52:45,759 --> 01:52:47,989
no one came.

1117
01:52:48,061 --> 01:52:49,961
No. Just come and see

1118
01:53:14,587 --> 01:53:18,216
Don't worry, no one could stop
anyone coming here.

1119
01:53:19,325 --> 01:53:22,488
If someone tries otherwise
I will take care of that.

1120
01:53:23,363 --> 01:53:25,888
You start your show,
I'll take care of the crowd.

1121
01:53:28,868 --> 01:53:30,130
There's a problem

1122
01:53:30,203 --> 01:53:31,932
You play Laila's father.

1123
01:53:32,005 --> 01:53:33,370
No.
- Come.

1124
01:53:36,042 --> 01:53:43,073
What makes fire and fire and
water to dry. That's called love.

1125
01:53:43,149 --> 01:53:48,746
For the people of Shamli, by the
people of Shamli, "Laila Majnu"

1126
01:53:53,459 --> 01:53:56,758
It's a story about a town.

1127
01:53:56,830 --> 01:54:00,459
But what town,
we don't know.

1128
01:54:00,533 --> 01:54:04,025
What we know is that
they used to be together

1129
01:54:04,103 --> 01:54:05,866
Be it night or day.

1130
01:54:05,939 --> 01:54:09,397
What day or what night?
We don't know that.

1131
01:54:09,843 --> 01:54:14,906
The thing we know is that
the teacher was asking him

1132
01:54:14,981 --> 01:54:18,542
to learn the lesson of God

1133
01:54:18,618 --> 01:54:20,347
Write down "Allah"

1134
01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:21,887
He writes, "Laila"

1135
01:54:21,955 --> 01:54:23,616
I said "Allah"

1136
01:54:23,690 --> 01:54:25,282
Laila, Laila, Laila

1137
01:54:25,358 --> 01:54:27,553
You will go to hell that

1138
01:54:27,627 --> 01:54:29,492
you keep on saying Laila.

1139
01:54:29,562 --> 01:54:33,157
That you compare Allah
with a human being.

1140
01:54:33,233 --> 01:54:34,393
Give me your hand

1141
01:54:34,467 --> 01:54:35,957
And other one too..

1142
01:54:40,974 --> 01:54:44,501
Don't hit him

1143
01:54:45,345 --> 01:54:50,078
It hurts.
Don't hit him.

1144
01:55:00,994 --> 01:55:06,557
Look at this small
shaking fist.

1145
01:55:07,433 --> 01:55:15,841
Relieve him.
It hurts, don't hit him.

1146
01:55:19,279 --> 01:55:22,680
It's strange, is it from God
or the scheme of devils.

1147
01:55:22,749 --> 01:55:27,345
That these little ones
are suffering

1148
01:55:33,393 --> 01:55:36,294
He's magician, don't go near him.

1149
01:55:36,362 --> 01:55:39,763
Make them stay apart.

1150
01:55:44,203 --> 01:55:48,105
Is it some magic or some curse.

1151
01:55:48,174 --> 01:55:51,302
Call someone to protect him.

1152
01:55:51,611 --> 01:55:54,842
Make them stay apart.

1153
01:56:04,157 --> 01:56:06,125
The childhood flew away
with the kites.

1154
01:56:06,993 --> 01:56:10,895
Heart started to feel the youth.

1155
02:01:23,209 --> 02:01:31,207
You low life, I will cut your hand.
You don't know who you touched.

1156
02:01:31,984 --> 02:01:33,542
She's mine.

1157
02:01:33,619 --> 02:01:42,152
I will get you to your grave.

1158
02:01:42,228 --> 02:01:49,600
If I don't, my name's not Tabrez.

1159
02:01:49,669 --> 02:01:51,296
She's mine.

1160
02:01:51,404 --> 02:01:52,803
It's enough

1161
02:01:52,872 --> 02:01:58,208
You touch body of a stranger.

1162
02:01:58,277 --> 02:02:01,610
Stop your fist.
You slapped her.

1163
02:02:07,720 --> 02:02:13,090
Who's my love,
my prayer.

1164
02:02:13,192 --> 02:02:18,789
Who's everything to me.

1165
02:02:19,899 --> 02:02:23,335
Who's tears of priceless.

1166
02:02:23,402 --> 02:02:26,599
Qais is saying,
she's my Laila.

1167
02:02:28,174 --> 02:02:30,802
You dare?
- It's courage.

1168
02:02:30,876 --> 02:02:34,004
Your movement?
- It's strength.

1169
02:02:35,281 --> 02:02:37,613
Stop it woman.

1170
02:02:37,683 --> 02:02:40,675
I'm not kind anymore.

1171
02:02:42,922 --> 02:02:45,891
I dig his grave.
Think about that.

1172
02:02:48,260 --> 02:02:51,457
But there will be two bodies.
Thank about that.

1173
02:02:57,770 --> 02:03:04,573
I swear, I will finish this today.

1174
02:03:30,336 --> 02:03:35,205
Majnu is crazy that he killed.

1175
02:03:35,274 --> 02:03:41,144
He will be stoned till death.
That's the law.

1176
02:05:53,779 --> 02:05:56,111
Laila shouted with courage.

1177
02:05:59,785 --> 02:06:03,118
If it is inevitable,
I will marry to someone else.

1178
02:06:10,296 --> 02:06:14,232
But let Majnu go out of the town.

1179
02:06:14,300 --> 02:06:17,667
That stones are tired too.

1180
02:06:17,736 --> 02:06:21,194
I'm giving my body to someone
but my soul remains with you.

1181
02:06:21,273 --> 02:06:25,004
Keep it safe with you.

1182
02:06:25,077 --> 02:06:28,410
I swear if someone comes to touch
my body,

1183
02:06:28,480 --> 02:06:32,246
he will find dust only.

1184
02:06:32,318 --> 02:06:35,685
Future will witness

1185
02:06:35,754 --> 02:06:39,588
That the God will come

1186
02:06:39,658 --> 02:06:41,353
on earth to put flowers on our graves.

1187
02:15:20,278 --> 02:15:23,076
Look, look sir, your wife.

1188
02:15:30,388 --> 02:15:32,948
Sometimes you don't know the
worth of your jewel.

1189
02:15:33,925 --> 02:15:42,333
I said that just being an ignorant.
Truth is if you weren't there...

1190
02:15:42,400 --> 02:15:45,597
Then?
- Then I wasn't alive.

1191
02:15:46,805 --> 02:15:48,363
Thank you.

1192
02:15:52,310 --> 02:15:53,504
Should I tell?
- Yes.

1193
02:15:54,179 --> 02:15:59,845
You're a great...
A great Majnu.

1194
02:16:05,390 --> 02:16:07,790
And you're a great twist.

1195
02:16:09,161 --> 02:16:14,724
You've always ignored my mistakes.
And I kept on doing them.

1196
02:16:21,506 --> 02:16:26,136
The girl whom I married and
accepted as a gift from God

1197
02:16:29,848 --> 02:16:35,445
I was using her for my business.
I should be cursed.

1198
02:16:36,354 --> 02:16:39,323
It's true.
I should be cursed.

1199
02:16:40,292 --> 02:16:47,255
Whatever you and your friends did...

1200
02:16:49,034 --> 02:16:54,028
If this art dies because of the mall.
There should be no mall at all.

1201
02:17:20,632 --> 02:17:21,496
Shall we go?

1202
02:17:24,102 --> 02:17:24,966
What happened?

1203
02:17:25,870 --> 02:17:28,134
I won't do this play again.

1204
02:17:30,775 --> 02:17:32,072
Because of me?

1205
02:17:36,781 --> 02:17:37,873
Yes

1206
02:17:38,850 --> 02:17:40,340
What have I done now?

1207
02:17:48,126 --> 02:17:50,959
I can't see you die everyday.

1208
02:17:54,099 --> 02:17:57,626
Don't say like this.
I'm telling you or...

1209
02:18:01,006 --> 02:18:02,598
Or...

1210
02:18:04,109 --> 02:18:06,373
Or I will die.

1211
02:18:19,858 --> 02:18:21,849
Are you at peace now?

1212
02:18:22,560 --> 02:18:24,619
Ajanta is safe now, teacher.

1213
02:18:27,198 --> 02:18:28,995
You were wrong doctor.

1214
02:18:29,868 --> 02:18:31,733
Everyone in this town
is my relative.

1215
02:18:33,004 --> 02:18:37,168
Here, demolition orders
cancelled, forever.

1216
02:18:37,942 --> 02:18:39,170
Thanks.
- Come

1217
02:18:39,911 --> 02:18:41,401
So what's your plan?

1218
02:18:42,380 --> 02:18:43,677
For now I'm going back.

1219
02:18:44,516 --> 02:18:46,882
Don't you think this
town needs you?

1220
02:18:48,053 --> 02:18:50,749
This town needed itself
not me.

1221
02:18:51,423 --> 02:18:54,187
And I needed for myself
to come here for once.

1222
02:18:55,126 --> 02:18:58,061
I had to do one thing,
and I did that.

1223
02:18:59,164 --> 02:19:02,656
By the way, it was good
fighting with you.

1224
02:19:03,835 --> 02:19:04,859
Me too.

1225
02:19:04,936 --> 02:19:07,598
Don't you think there should
be some more fight.

1226
02:19:07,672 --> 02:19:08,366
What?

1227
02:19:08,440 --> 02:19:11,432
You liked it, I liked it,
there must be some good in it.

1228
02:19:12,177 --> 02:19:13,576
I don't like to fight
without a reason.

1229
02:19:14,546 --> 02:19:17,913
No fight is without a reason.
That's what you taught us.
