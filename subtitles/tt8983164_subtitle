1
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:28,917
Montu!

2
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,250
Montu!

3
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,750
- Montu!
- Hmm?

4
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,292
Wake up now.

5
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:39,875
You'll miss the assembly.

6
00:05:40,042 --> 00:05:41,500
Five minutes more.

7
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,208
I said you'll miss the assembly.

8
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:44,667
Aren't you going to teach
PT (Physical Training) today?

9
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,000
Bablu will handle it.

10
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,000
Anyway, he gets it done every day.

11
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,875
It's not like doing PT
will help them become Bill Gates.

12
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:52,333
Who?

13
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:53,833
What are you doing?

14
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:54,958
Make them who?

15
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:56,958
Ambani, Mom.

16
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,208
Haven't you heard...

17
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:02,458
All play and no work
makes Jack a dumb boy.

18
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:03,333
Drop it

19
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:05,333
This is Sehwag's Haryana.

20
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:07,875
You know how many gold
medals Haryana's athletes win?

21
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,208
Yet you mentioned a cricketer.

22
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:12,333
Can you list any gold-winning athletes?

23
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,417
And Sehwag isn't from Haryana.
He's from Najafgarh, Delhi.

24
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,833
I'm concerned about these kids' future,

25
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:19,583
that's why I don't waste
their time with fun and games.

26
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:22,833
Just wake up! I have to boil the milk.

27
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,083
- Mom!
- Wake up.

28
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,833
At least shut the door.

29
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:32,167
Good morning, Mr. Lawyer.

30
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:33,583
Good morning.

31
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:35,292
Good morning, Aunty.

32
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,917
I'm not your aunty.

33
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,667
You forget that you
were Montu's teacher.

34
00:06:41,747 --> 00:06:43,417
You are his Uncle!

35
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,458
Having young friends
won't make you young.

36
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,833
What's got you so grumpy this morning?

37
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:52,542
And having older friends
won't make you any wiser.

38
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:54,458
Come on, Mr. Lawyer.

39
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:58,000
What can you except from someone
who has such a dufus for a teacher?

40
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,375
And on top of that a bachelor still.

41
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,917
Didn't get married himself and now
isn't letting my son get married.

42
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,292
Mr. Lawyer,
tell Aunty not to get personal.

43
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,500
I'm not a bachelor. I'm a widow.

44
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,708
Randawa.

45
00:07:09,953 --> 00:07:10,667
What?

46
00:07:10,917 --> 00:07:12,542
Mister, you are a Randawa.

47
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:15,708
Go and tell this tale
to someone else, Shukla.

48
00:07:16,158 --> 00:07:18,575
The truth is you are
the one who has spoilt Montu.

49
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,367
Otherwise, he would've at least
been a subject teacher by now.

50
00:07:21,492 --> 00:07:22,075
Of course.

51
00:07:22,283 --> 00:07:24,492
His mother also says
Montu has spoilt Shukla,

52
00:07:24,825 --> 00:07:26,042
otherwise he would have
been a professor by now.

53
00:07:26,122 --> 00:07:26,658
Right.

54
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,117
His mother addresses him as Shukla?

55
00:07:28,242 --> 00:07:29,117
No.

56
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:31,117
- Come on, Mom.
- That's just crossing the line.

57
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,908
What's this, man?

58
00:07:33,658 --> 00:07:35,283
You are wearing shorts again?

59
00:07:36,075 --> 00:07:38,158
At least get yourself
a decent pair of pants made.

60
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:40,408
Why? When I can get two shorts
made for the price of one pair of pants?

61
00:07:40,742 --> 00:07:41,450
I'm saving money.

62
00:07:41,617 --> 00:07:42,617
- Right, Dad?
- Yeah.

63
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,325
- Look here Shukla.
- Yeah.

64
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,367
Ran-Da-Wa.

65
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:50,783
A man whose wife
is either dead or has left him.

66
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,825
Hold on. Where does it say,
'or has left him'?

67
00:07:53,992 --> 00:07:56,200
Well, some things are
not mentioned in here.

68
00:07:56,408 --> 00:07:57,408
They are stated up here.

69
00:07:58,408 --> 00:07:59,700
Aunty!

70
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,408
Make some stuffed
flatbreads so that we can get going.

71
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:04,158
I'll smack him with my slippers
if he calls me aunty one more time.

72
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:04,950
I'm telling you.

73
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:06,950
You keep saying it,
but you never act on it.

74
00:08:07,075 --> 00:08:07,992
I'll do it also.

75
00:08:08,117 --> 00:08:12,617
Look, in English it means widower.

76
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,825
A man who has lost his wife.

77
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,658
Yeah, so widower sounds better.

78
00:08:16,783 --> 00:08:20,992
But honestly,
Randawa suits you better.

79
00:08:22,117 --> 00:08:23,867
Dad, you aren't ready yet?
Don't you have to go to work?

80
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,158
Court opens at nine.

81
00:08:25,283 --> 00:08:27,242
But the kids must be lining up to
hitch a ride with you.

82
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:28,033
Let's go, Shukla Ji.

83
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:30,200
- My lunch, Mom?
- I'm dying to get out of here.

84
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,825
Talk some sense into him.

85
00:08:32,283 --> 00:08:33,367
Bye, Aunty!

86
00:08:33,492 --> 00:08:35,075
- I'll break your jaw.
- You'll get beat up.

87
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,700
Ran-Da-Wa.

88
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:37,533
Wow.

89
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,158
Morning, Madam.

90
00:08:48,283 --> 00:08:50,075
Is this the way to enter?

91
00:08:52,742 --> 00:08:53,908
Did you measure that?

92
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,492
- And the length?
- Yes. Hold here.

93
00:08:55,783 --> 00:08:57,992
May I come in, Madam?

94
00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:00,200
Yes, come in.

95
00:09:00,617 --> 00:09:01,283
Morning, Madam.

96
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:02,742
What's this morning business?

97
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,283
Everyone knows that it's morning.

98
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,492
Are you too lazy to
add 'good' before it, Montu?

99
00:09:06,617 --> 00:09:07,450
Mahinder.

100
00:09:07,617 --> 00:09:08,658
"Mahinder!"

101
00:09:08,742 --> 00:09:12,117
I've known him since he was this big,
running around the school in shorts.

102
00:09:12,242 --> 00:09:15,158
Look at him. What impression will people
form of the teachers in this school?

103
00:09:15,283 --> 00:09:16,825
Where's the register?
I need to mark my attendance.

104
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,742
You get marked present
only if you show up on time.

105
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:21,658
Then mark me absent.
I'm going back home.

106
00:09:21,783 --> 00:09:24,075
Go ahead. I will cut your salary.

107
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:25,950
I'm allowed paid
leaves by the Ministry.

108
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,158
You have already exhausted
your paid leaves, kiddo.

109
00:09:28,283 --> 00:09:29,075
When?

110
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,492
Check the register.

111
00:09:30,617 --> 00:09:32,408
You didn't come at all last week.

112
00:09:32,617 --> 00:09:33,617
Where is your signature? Show me!

113
00:09:33,742 --> 00:09:35,033
Why do you need the signature?

114
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,117
Didn't I meet you every day last week?

115
00:09:37,617 --> 00:09:39,367
Who showed the school to
the wedding party on Monday?

116
00:09:39,658 --> 00:09:41,283
Who finalized their booking on Tuesday?

117
00:09:41,408 --> 00:09:43,158
Who got your car serviced on Wednesday?

118
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,283
And who decided the
area for the wedding ceremony on Friday?

119
00:09:45,408 --> 00:09:47,700
But you get paid according
to what this register says.

120
00:09:47,825 --> 00:09:48,700
And the register says that...

121
00:09:48,825 --> 00:09:50,867
Come on, Madam. Since when
can the register speak for itself?

122
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,367
Have you had a drink
this early in the morning...?

123
00:09:54,408 --> 00:09:57,658
I think you should let the register make
the arrangements for the next wedding.

124
00:09:57,783 --> 00:09:58,825
It will 'talk' to everybody.

125
00:09:58,992 --> 00:09:59,992
Montu.

126
00:10:00,658 --> 00:10:01,908
This is not right, Madam.

127
00:10:02,408 --> 00:10:04,658
You are doing this
just to give me a pay cut.

128
00:10:04,992 --> 00:10:06,950
Here I'm thinking about
coming up with a fake holiday.

129
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:09,700
So that we don't lose
the booking on Thursday.

130
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:12,783
And you are bothering
about such trivial things.

131
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,950
- Where are the mattresses?
- What?

132
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:19,117
What will the guests think when
they'll see old torn mattresses?

133
00:10:19,242 --> 00:10:20,325
I'm the one who won't
get the full payment.

134
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,950
I'm the one who'll suffer a loss.

135
00:10:22,658 --> 00:10:23,950
Who will get the mattresses?

136
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,450
Yes, who will get the mattresses?

137
00:10:25,617 --> 00:10:27,742
That's what I'm asking,
who will get the mattresses?

138
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:29,242
You'll get the mattresses!

139
00:10:31,992 --> 00:10:33,825
Keep it steady like this.

140
00:10:33,992 --> 00:10:37,992
I have to say, Usha is very dynamic.

141
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,992
I mean when we were young, then also.

142
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:44,158
That's why she's the principal, man.

143
00:10:45,492 --> 00:10:48,075
Anyway, talking about
the past won't do us any good.

144
00:10:48,617 --> 00:10:50,950
Sir, can I get a new leather ball?

145
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,658
Its stitches are coming off.

146
00:10:54,617 --> 00:10:55,325
Hey Specky.

147
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,117
Yes, sir?

148
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:57,742
That one, shorty.

149
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,992
Play a little.

150
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,825
If you keep your head
buried in books all day,

151
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,658
you'll soon have to replace
those glasses with binoculars.

152
00:11:02,825 --> 00:11:05,158
Sir, if I finish my homework now...

153
00:11:05,283 --> 00:11:07,825
I can begin with next term's syllabus
when I get home.

154
00:11:08,825 --> 00:11:09,825
Take notes from him.

155
00:11:10,242 --> 00:11:11,950
Want a new ball, huh.
Go and study instead.

156
00:11:12,783 --> 00:11:14,950
And listen, where's Bablu?

157
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,908
Busy playing hopscotch, with Pinky.

158
00:11:26,158 --> 00:11:28,325
Romance is going to make
these boys soft and their cheeks go pink.

159
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,658
Jump to two. Yes!

160
00:11:29,783 --> 00:11:31,033
Come, let's play some Cricket.

161
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:33,992
This kid has become a Casanova.

162
00:11:34,242 --> 00:11:35,700
Come on, come on, come on, sir.

163
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:37,908
Wear a helmet, Shukla Ji.
You're about to face the Jajjhar Express.

164
00:11:38,075 --> 00:11:41,617
Montu!
Listen up, man.

165
00:11:42,283 --> 00:11:45,533
I'm lagging behind with the
syllabus of ninth and tenth grade.

166
00:11:45,658 --> 00:11:46,950
I want your classes today.

167
00:11:47,075 --> 00:11:48,033
Go on, they are all yours.

168
00:11:48,158 --> 00:11:49,283
- Thank you.
- Have fun.

169
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,200
- Get aside!
- Dimpy!

170
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,825
Hey Dimpy!

171
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,450
Shukla Ji, try this sauce.

172
00:11:56,575 --> 00:11:58,450
I watched a Masterchef
video on YouTube and made it.

173
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,283
- Really?
- Yeah.

174
00:11:59,408 --> 00:12:00,867
Dimwit, you are just a cook.

175
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:03,953
Watching a Masterchef video on YouTube and
making a sauce doesn't make anyone a chef.

176
00:12:04,033 --> 00:12:04,537
True.

177
00:12:04,617 --> 00:12:08,367
The name of the shop is Chautala
and Sons, so that makes me its chef.

178
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,950
You are a cook.

179
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,033
And the name of the shop is Chautala and Sons,
not grandson.

180
00:12:13,158 --> 00:12:13,742
True.

181
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,617
- Chotu.
- Yes, sir?

182
00:12:15,742 --> 00:12:17,117
Hold their fritters' order.

183
00:12:17,242 --> 00:12:18,992
They have had enough.
It's time for them to go home.

184
00:12:19,075 --> 00:12:21,492
- Oh, you felt bad about what I said.
- No, I didn't.

185
00:12:21,685 --> 00:12:23,075
Fine, I accept that
you are Chautala and Sons.

186
00:12:23,155 --> 00:12:24,658
Shukla Ji, he's Chautala and Sons.

187
00:12:24,783 --> 00:12:26,492
- Yes, given.
- Call for the fritters.

188
00:12:26,572 --> 00:12:27,242
And?

189
00:12:27,492 --> 00:12:28,200
And what?

190
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,200
Oh chef. I accept you are a chef, bro.

191
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,033
You are the best chef in town.
Please get them.

192
00:12:32,113 --> 00:12:33,200
- Chotu.
- Yes, sir?

193
00:12:33,408 --> 00:12:33,950
Get them.

194
00:12:34,075 --> 00:12:35,481
Look, you've given two each.

195
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:36,825
Call for some sweets as well.

196
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,408
Shukla Ji, you are a limit.

197
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:41,950
Why don't you come once
and gobble everything up?

198
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:42,533
Hello?

199
00:12:42,658 --> 00:12:44,283
Why do you get upset
over such petty things?

200
00:12:44,408 --> 00:12:46,075
- I'm not getting upset.
- What are you saying? Slow down.

201
00:12:46,492 --> 00:12:48,450
- You're very dear to me
- What?

202
00:12:48,658 --> 00:12:49,533
Chotu, listen up.

203
00:12:49,742 --> 00:12:50,950
- Give Shukla Ji whatever...
- Where?

204
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,450
You want to become a lover boy?

205
00:12:58,530 --> 00:12:59,908
- Yeah I want to. What will you do?
- Leave me, leave me

206
00:12:59,992 --> 00:13:02,408
- What will you do, what will you do?
- Get aside, get aside.

207
00:13:02,742 --> 00:13:04,492
Ask him what happened.
He just came and started hitting me.

208
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,742
- They are acting like wild dogs.
- Calm down.

209
00:13:06,867 --> 00:13:08,492
- What happened?
- He wants to be a lover boy.

210
00:13:08,783 --> 00:13:10,075
He's just a kid, drop it.

211
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,325
Tell me, what will you do about it, huh?

212
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,658
You won't say anything
because he is here now?

213
00:13:14,075 --> 00:13:15,200
I'll talk to him.

214
00:13:17,658 --> 00:13:19,617
Who slapped him?

215
00:13:19,908 --> 00:13:21,658
You...

216
00:13:22,742 --> 00:13:24,283
Hey, watch it!

217
00:13:24,408 --> 00:13:27,492
Hey, listen up!

218
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,658
You...
Listen to me.

219
00:13:30,742 --> 00:13:33,575
- Give him a good beating.

220
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:37,242
- How much for these eggplants?
- 20 bucks a kilo.

221
00:13:39,894 --> 00:13:40,867
Weigh them in.

222
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,450
We won't spare you.

223
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,272
- Pay up, Sir.
- Get out of my way!

224
00:13:54,325 --> 00:13:55,492
Hey.

225
00:13:55,783 --> 00:13:59,117
Mister, what are you looking at?

226
00:13:59,242 --> 00:14:03,450
Give me a second.
Hold on. Hang on for just a second.

227
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:09,033
Will anyone tell
me what's happened? Huh?

228
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:13,200
Sir, his brother was planning
to elope with our daughter.

229
00:14:13,325 --> 00:14:15,242
- Yes.
- What are you saying, Uncle?

230
00:14:15,367 --> 00:14:16,533
He doesn't even have enough
money to hire a rickshaw,

231
00:14:16,613 --> 00:14:17,867
how can he elope with your daughter?

232
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,200
Oh really! Then ask him,...

233
00:14:20,283 --> 00:14:22,617
what was he doing in
the vegetable market with our daughter?

234
00:14:22,742 --> 00:14:23,617
What were you doing?

235
00:14:23,825 --> 00:14:24,658
Having an ice candy.

236
00:14:24,783 --> 00:14:25,617
Heard that?

237
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,408
Can't kids have an ice candy?

238
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,658
How does eating ice
candy lead to eloping?

239
00:14:29,783 --> 00:14:32,450
No, the issue isn't that
they were having an ice candy.

240
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:32,867
Yes.

241
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,783
The issue is that they
were sharing an ice candy.

242
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,617
Yes, they were sharing it.

243
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,700
You two were sharing it?

244
00:14:39,908 --> 00:14:41,242
We only had money to buy one.

245
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:43,412
That's why we got the one with
mixed flavours, Wild Berry and Orange.

246
00:14:43,492 --> 00:14:44,367
You see that?

247
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:45,908
Wild Berry?

248
00:14:46,102 --> 00:14:47,117
Pinky likes it.

249
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:49,060
Look at that, he's being cheesy again.

250
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,367
Calm down. Hang on a second.
Listen to me, Uncle.

251
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:52,200
Please just hear me out.

252
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,825
Your daughter too was
having the ice candy, right?

253
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:54,408
So?

254
00:14:54,783 --> 00:14:56,075
She is the one who asked
for Wild Berry.

255
00:14:56,155 --> 00:14:56,533
Huh?

256
00:14:56,613 --> 00:14:58,283
He still prefers Orange.

257
00:14:58,408 --> 00:14:59,658
- He's just a kid.
- Huh?

258
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:00,867
Tell me something,

259
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,992
how can someone who still enjoys Orange
elope with someone who likes Wild Berry?

260
00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:06,870
I mean it's clear from the flavour
choices as to who would think of eloping.

261
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,242
How do the flavours matter in this?

262
00:15:08,322 --> 00:15:10,283
You cannot compare
Wild Berry with Orange

263
00:15:10,408 --> 00:15:12,287
- This is not right.
- You are a grown up.

264
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:14,742
- Listen to me.
- Calm down. Hang on.

265
00:15:15,742 --> 00:15:18,783
I guarantee that from now on our
boy won't share,

266
00:15:18,908 --> 00:15:22,995
an ice candy with anyone's
daughter let alone yours.

267
00:15:23,075 --> 00:15:25,533
- You are taking me lightly, Sir.
- This is a limit.

268
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:26,787
You have no respect for me only

269
00:15:26,867 --> 00:15:28,950
- Escort them out of here
- You think this is a joke?

270
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:31,825
- I won't let this go so easily.
- Do whatever you can.

271
00:15:31,908 --> 00:15:33,742
Why are you doing this? Drop it.

272
00:15:44,575 --> 00:15:45,492
Give me that one.

273
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:47,242
It has double ghee in it, right?

274
00:15:47,783 --> 00:15:48,992
Here, take 50%.

275
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,242
I think I'll only get to eat
food cooked by me till the day I die.

276
00:15:54,117 --> 00:15:55,992
I've got him over a
dozen marriage proposals.

277
00:15:56,825 --> 00:15:58,408
But he keeps rejecting everyone.

278
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,825
I've fixed a meeting
for tomorrow as well.

279
00:16:01,408 --> 00:16:02,867
How can I get married like this?

280
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,283
This isn't how it's done.

281
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:05,908
Meeting's fixed on a Sunday,
the girl and boy meet,

282
00:16:05,992 --> 00:16:08,492
have snacks, act shy,
have some small talk, smile, say yes,

283
00:16:08,572 --> 00:16:09,950
get the invites printed,
call your family, book a DJ,

284
00:16:10,075 --> 00:16:11,200
the groom gets on a horse and boom,
you are married.

285
00:16:11,992 --> 00:16:13,200
This isn't how marriages are done.

286
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,367
This is exactly how they're done.
How else are they done?

287
00:16:17,158 --> 00:16:17,950
This is how I got married.

288
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:18,992
This is how Dara Singh got married.

289
00:16:19,117 --> 00:16:20,200
And this is how you
will get married.

290
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,200
Dad, how can you get
to know in the first meeting,

291
00:16:23,325 --> 00:16:25,492
whether your tuning matches
with that of the girl or not?

292
00:16:26,408 --> 00:16:28,950
Son, you should have
mentioned that sooner.

293
00:16:29,825 --> 00:16:30,533
No problem.

294
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:35,117
I'll ask them to send their daughter
to our place for a couple of months,

295
00:16:35,408 --> 00:16:38,617
so that our son can
match his tuning with hers.

296
00:16:39,325 --> 00:16:40,117
Really?

297
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:41,492
Dimwit.

298
00:16:41,742 --> 00:16:44,533
I'm warning you,
I'll confirm the match this Sunday.

299
00:16:44,658 --> 00:16:46,492
- Why do you keep hitting me?
- Always does as he pleases.

300
00:16:46,617 --> 00:16:47,367
Exactly.

301
00:16:47,658 --> 00:16:49,075
I have also watched the movie,
Hum Aapke Hain Kaun.

302
00:16:49,283 --> 00:16:50,658
I also want to be like Salman Khan.

303
00:16:50,783 --> 00:16:53,075
Of course, you are Salman
Khan and I'm his elder brother.

304
00:16:53,325 --> 00:16:54,950
And your face looks like their dog Tuffy.

305
00:16:55,783 --> 00:16:56,492
Son?

306
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,658
No, you don't look like Salman Khan.

307
00:17:00,783 --> 00:17:03,617
I'm warning you,
I'll confirm the match this Sunday.

308
00:17:04,325 --> 00:17:05,617
I'm telling you, I won't go anywhere.

309
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,742
I'm very busy.

310
00:17:07,158 --> 00:17:08,783
And what are you busy with?

311
00:17:09,075 --> 00:17:11,117
'Come, let's celebrate
the day of love.'

312
00:17:27,658 --> 00:17:28,617
Get them. Get that donkey.

313
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,742
Get down, Romeo.
Get down, I said.

314
00:17:30,867 --> 00:17:31,950
Get him. Get him.

315
00:17:32,033 --> 00:17:33,158
Get that one as well.

316
00:17:33,283 --> 00:17:33,992
Get that Sardar as well.

317
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:36,075
Let's make them celebrate
Valentine's day.

318
00:17:37,742 --> 00:17:39,867
Turn his backside red.
Take them away.

319
00:17:40,783 --> 00:17:41,950
They all want to be lover boys.

320
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:44,283
They are getting romantic, huh?
Come on. Sit down.

321
00:17:45,658 --> 00:17:46,242
Oh no.

322
00:17:46,367 --> 00:17:47,867
Take a picture.
Click their pictures.

323
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,450
Let's go.

324
00:17:48,617 --> 00:17:50,158
No, no. Just relax.

325
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:53,158
Click their pictures.
Remain seated.

326
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:56,783
Sonu, Dimpy, come with me.

327
00:17:56,908 --> 00:17:59,158
- What happened?
- Let's go.

328
00:17:59,450 --> 00:17:59,950
Look at this.

329
00:18:00,242 --> 00:18:01,408
Oldies are acting romantic, huh?

330
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:04,033
Really Uncle, you've eloped at this age?

331
00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:05,700
She's the wife.

332
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,617
Whose?

333
00:18:06,783 --> 00:18:07,658
Who are you?

334
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:09,075
And what is this nonsense?

335
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,742
Oh!

336
00:18:10,158 --> 00:18:12,075
So you're the ones who're frolicking around
in the park and we're being indecent?

337
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,117
Watch it. Mind your tongue.

338
00:18:14,242 --> 00:18:15,200
Don't you have parents?

339
00:18:15,325 --> 00:18:16,117
- I do.
- Then?

340
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,617
But they do such things in the
privacy of a home and not in a park.

341
00:18:19,117 --> 00:18:20,325
Don't you have Indian
values instilled in you?

342
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,742
You are going around with
such a young girl at this age?

343
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:22,950
She's my wife.

344
00:18:23,283 --> 00:18:24,783
She's 10 years younger than me.

345
00:18:25,242 --> 00:18:26,367
What's the proof that she's your wife?

346
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:28,283
We have a daughter together,
a live proof.

347
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:29,075
- Right.
- First take your hand off her.

348
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,408
Take your hand off
and give me the proof.

349
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:33,075
- Make him talk to her over the phone.
- Okay.

350
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:34,325
Fine, let me talk to her.

351
00:18:35,825 --> 00:18:36,992
We come from a decent family.

352
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,783
Put the decency on speaker.

353
00:18:38,908 --> 00:18:39,825
There you go.

354
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:41,742
Yes, Dad?

355
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,575
Your dad was caught in Buddha
Garden with a woman.

356
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,492
A woman? Who?

357
00:18:45,617 --> 00:18:46,825
- Dad?
- It's me.

358
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,075
- Mom?
- This woman.

359
00:18:48,325 --> 00:18:49,950
Who are you? She is my mother.

360
00:18:50,117 --> 00:18:50,658
See?

361
00:18:50,783 --> 00:18:51,908
My name is Montu.

362
00:18:51,992 --> 00:18:54,075
And it's my job to put a stop to
this westernized tradition of romance.

363
00:18:54,492 --> 00:18:55,492
What is this nonsense?

364
00:18:55,742 --> 00:18:57,283
It's your dad who is acting cheap here.

365
00:18:57,742 --> 00:18:59,742
You too should feel ashamed
for letting your dad...

366
00:19:00,408 --> 00:19:01,492
Hang on a second.

367
00:19:01,902 --> 00:19:03,142
How do we know whether she's
really your daughter or not?

368
00:19:03,222 --> 00:19:04,143
- This is not done.
- Keep your phone back in your pocket.

369
00:19:04,223 --> 00:19:04,584
No, this is.

370
00:19:04,664 --> 00:19:05,563
- Time to make him famous.
- Dad.

371
00:19:05,643 --> 00:19:07,005
- Click their picture.
- You dial 100 on your phone. I'm coming there

372
00:19:07,085 --> 00:19:09,033
- Do you want me to punch you?
- This is not right.

373
00:19:09,113 --> 00:19:10,620
- Come on, click their picture.
- Let him go.

374
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,950
- Brother.
- Stand next to him.

375
00:19:12,075 --> 00:19:13,412
- Look there.
- Let him go.

376
00:19:13,492 --> 00:19:15,328
- Stand next to him. Take a step closer.
- Look there.

377
00:19:15,408 --> 00:19:16,658
- We are decent people.
- Let him go.

378
00:19:16,783 --> 00:19:17,908
- Smile, Dimpy.
- Yeah.

379
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:24,617
Isn't that awesome, Shukla Ji?

380
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,533
Montu, I think it's time
you start preparing for politics.

381
00:19:27,658 --> 00:19:28,742
What are you saying?

382
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:29,742
What am I saying?

383
00:19:29,908 --> 00:19:31,033
You think I have it in me?

384
00:19:31,158 --> 00:19:33,245
Of course, hundred percent.
Don't do you think so, Kode Sir?

385
00:19:33,325 --> 00:19:34,200
Absolutely, Shukla Ji.

386
00:19:34,492 --> 00:19:36,200
- Right.
- This is our staff room.

387
00:19:36,492 --> 00:19:38,533
That's Sunil Sir.

388
00:19:38,867 --> 00:19:41,033
He teaches Science.
And this is Mrs. Sushila.

389
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,450
She teaches Geography.

390
00:19:42,658 --> 00:19:45,283
That's Mr. Kapoor.

391
00:19:45,363 --> 00:19:46,658
He teaches Mathematics.

392
00:19:46,783 --> 00:19:48,783
This is our senior most teacher,
Shukla Ji.

393
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:49,950
He teaches Hindi.

394
00:19:50,617 --> 00:19:51,200
Madam?

395
00:19:51,408 --> 00:19:55,408
And this is our talented PTI
(Physical Training Instructor), Montu.

396
00:19:56,075 --> 00:19:56,825
Mahinder.

397
00:19:57,033 --> 00:19:58,283
Myself, Mahinder Hooda.

398
00:19:58,992 --> 00:20:00,992
Meet Ms. Neelima.

399
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,450
She'll be teaching Computers from today.

400
00:20:03,742 --> 00:20:04,617
Okay.

401
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,700
- Hello.
- Usha is so young at heart.

402
00:20:10,825 --> 00:20:12,658
So, Computers?

403
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:19,617
Montu, isn't this your
picture in the newspaper?

404
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:21,867
I just noticed it.

405
00:20:22,117 --> 00:20:23,533
- Yes.
- You've made the headlines.

406
00:20:23,613 --> 00:20:25,867
- Come on, Shukla Ji.
- No, it's great.

407
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,408
My picture got printed.

408
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,200
Great picture.

409
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:30,867
Thank you.

410
00:20:31,283 --> 00:20:32,367
Of my parents.

411
00:20:35,846 --> 00:20:39,617
Yesterday, a worthless local
goon troubled them in the park.

412
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,742
I even spoke to him over the phone.

413
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,200
He said his name was Montu or something.

414
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:51,950
Honestly, I felt
like slapping him through the phone.

415
00:20:54,133 --> 00:20:55,617
Now I think I shouldn't bother.

416
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:58,117
I will dirty my own hands.

417
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:02,533
But I do pity the students here.

418
00:21:04,158 --> 00:21:07,408
With such goon like teachers around,
what will become of them?

419
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:22,158
Being cheap is one thing, but
being proud of that fact is a big thing.

420
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:24,325
Wow!

421
00:21:34,283 --> 00:21:36,992
Why didn't you tell
her that her mom looked hot,

422
00:21:37,072 --> 00:21:39,408
and her dad looked like an old pot,
so you got confused.

423
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:41,450
Anyone can get confused.
It's not a big...

424
00:21:41,825 --> 00:21:43,158
Where are you going?

425
00:21:44,853 --> 00:21:46,450
Ms. Neelima.

426
00:21:46,575 --> 00:21:48,992
Ms. Neelima, I...

427
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:50,867
Go home.

428
00:21:51,408 --> 00:21:52,742
Hey, take your notebook with you.

429
00:21:54,658 --> 00:21:56,450
I wanted to talk to you.

430
00:21:57,367 --> 00:21:59,242
- Yes, Mr. Mahinder?
- Montu.

431
00:22:01,117 --> 00:22:03,575
It was a misunderstanding,
the other day.

432
00:22:04,242 --> 00:22:08,033
Your parents were in the park,
so I thought that...

433
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:12,450
You know girls and boys
go there to do indecent things.

434
00:22:13,117 --> 00:22:15,783
And people don't act
their age these days, so...

435
00:22:17,658 --> 00:22:18,533
Sorry.

436
00:22:20,617 --> 00:22:22,408
Are you apologizing
or justifying yourself?

437
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,700
Don't apologize if
you are justifying it.

438
00:22:25,908 --> 00:22:27,783
And don't justify
if you are apologizing.

439
00:22:29,908 --> 00:22:31,367
And I can understand
your need to apologize.

440
00:22:31,908 --> 00:22:33,992
You are apologizing because I look good.

441
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,533
If I didn't look good, you wouldn't have
even thought about it, let alone apologize.

442
00:22:39,283 --> 00:22:42,033
Keep your apology to yourself.
I don't need it.

443
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,158
But...

444
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:45,950
What wrong things do
girls and boys do in the park?

445
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,700
And who are you to
decide how they should behave?

446
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,700
To love each other, to like each other,
to sit together, to hold hands...

447
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,825
Are these things illegal?

448
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,158
You won't hold the hand
of the person you like?

449
00:22:55,283 --> 00:22:56,453
- Please...
- You won't sit with her?

450
00:22:56,533 --> 00:22:58,783
So, where will you take her?
To your home or to a hotel?

451
00:22:59,117 --> 00:23:01,033
Do you know what your problem is?

452
00:23:01,325 --> 00:23:02,283
The Holier Than Thou Complex.

453
00:23:02,533 --> 00:23:05,700
You cannot be a decent human being
but you have an ego fit for a God.

454
00:23:19,075 --> 00:23:20,742
I couldn't hear anything.

455
00:23:21,903 --> 00:23:24,450
But I could feel the insult
from afar.

456
00:23:25,617 --> 00:23:27,658
I'm sure she must have drawn blood.

457
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:29,492
Turn around, let me check.

458
00:23:29,572 --> 00:23:31,075
Hey.
It's nothing.

459
00:23:31,408 --> 00:23:33,075
We were just talking. It's a little...

460
00:23:33,481 --> 00:23:33,950
Let's go.

461
00:23:35,992 --> 00:23:38,992
I have to say, it is her father's fault.

462
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,908
He got married to
someone so much younger.

463
00:23:42,561 --> 00:23:45,325
It's okay, I understand,
there can be misunderstandings.

464
00:23:45,878 --> 00:23:49,408
But being so insulting is not justified,
my friend.

465
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,200
You are right.

466
00:23:51,801 --> 00:23:53,658
Tell me, what did we do wrong?

467
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,700
Just maligned her parents'
character in front of a few people.

468
00:23:58,575 --> 00:24:00,075
Just got their picture
printed in the newspaper

469
00:24:00,155 --> 00:24:01,742
which damaged their
reputation in the city.

470
00:24:01,822 --> 00:24:03,283
What is the big deal?

471
00:24:03,466 --> 00:24:03,992
Right.

472
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:06,283
It is so not right to get
angry over such a petty thing.

473
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:06,992
Right?

474
00:24:07,242 --> 00:24:07,700
Right.

475
00:24:07,992 --> 00:24:12,367
So she is rude and what you made me
do is a lesson in doing the right thing.

476
00:24:12,447 --> 00:24:13,617
What I made you do?

477
00:24:14,117 --> 00:24:16,325
You are so duplicitous.

478
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,908
I was justifying your actions,

479
00:24:18,992 --> 00:24:20,783
so that I can give
you some moral support.

480
00:24:20,863 --> 00:24:23,408
- But you...
- I don't want your support.

481
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,908
I don't want your morals either.
You can have them.

482
00:24:26,783 --> 00:24:28,950
She is right and we are wrong.

483
00:24:32,325 --> 00:24:33,658
She has a right to abuse me.

484
00:24:38,742 --> 00:24:41,658
Yesterday, we learnt how
to make a document in Word.

485
00:24:42,078 --> 00:24:42,912
Remember?

486
00:24:42,992 --> 00:24:43,783
Yes, Ma'am.

487
00:24:43,863 --> 00:24:46,325
Today, we will learn how
to rename that same document.

488
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,283
Okay?

489
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:50,825
Good morning, Sir.

490
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:52,783
Sit down.

491
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,283
Thank you, Sir.

492
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:56,825
Good morning, Ms. Neelima.

493
00:24:56,905 --> 00:24:58,783
Yes, Sir?
Do you need anything?

494
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,200
No, I was just taking a round...

495
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:03,242
What have you done?

496
00:25:03,322 --> 00:25:04,992
I haven't done anything, Sir.

497
00:25:05,072 --> 00:25:06,575
- Don't try to be a rockstar!
- Hey.

498
00:25:07,825 --> 00:25:09,992
No one dare trouble madam. Understood?

499
00:25:10,617 --> 00:25:11,450
- Hold your ears.
- Hey.

500
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:12,325
Mr. Mahinder.

501
00:25:12,742 --> 00:25:14,367
I can handle my students myself.

502
00:25:14,553 --> 00:25:16,658
If you misbehave or
raise your hand on them again,

503
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:19,908
I'll file a complaint directly with the
Education Board and not the Principal.

504
00:25:20,782 --> 00:25:22,408
- Madam, you...
- Out.

505
00:25:24,062 --> 00:25:24,950
Really?

506
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,400
Let me know if anybody misbehaves.

507
00:25:30,858 --> 00:25:31,650
Hold your ears.

508
00:25:32,317 --> 00:25:33,358
Hands down.

509
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:35,858
Do as madam says.

510
00:25:36,025 --> 00:25:36,567
Do it.

511
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:40,942
Where were we?

512
00:25:41,108 --> 00:25:42,567
You'll have lunch in the staff room?

513
00:25:43,525 --> 00:25:45,025
No, in the Principal's office.

514
00:25:45,233 --> 00:25:45,942
Okay.

515
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,025
Bablu!

516
00:26:05,525 --> 00:26:06,525
What are you doing?

517
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:08,983
Is this how I've taught
you to play a square cut?

518
00:26:09,108 --> 00:26:09,858
Huh?

519
00:26:10,956 --> 00:26:13,775
In the future when you'll play for India in
the World Cup, will you embarrass us all?

520
00:26:13,898 --> 00:26:15,900
But Sir, this is how
you have taught me to play.

521
00:26:16,067 --> 00:26:18,191
And how can I play a
leg side ball towards square?

522
00:26:19,525 --> 00:26:20,650
Stop stupidness.

523
00:26:20,775 --> 00:26:22,025
No debate competition.

524
00:26:22,233 --> 00:26:22,900
Go here.

525
00:26:23,442 --> 00:26:24,108
Go.

526
00:26:25,942 --> 00:26:26,817
Look over here.

527
00:26:27,275 --> 00:26:28,525
Everyone see how it's done.

528
00:26:29,148 --> 00:26:30,275
Everyone, eyes over here.

529
00:26:31,025 --> 00:26:31,733
Come on Piyush.

530
00:26:32,317 --> 00:26:34,358
Keep it on off side, short ball. Okay?

531
00:26:34,483 --> 00:26:35,317
For a square cut.

532
00:26:35,442 --> 00:26:36,400
And Piyush, listen.

533
00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:39,275
Fast paced. Okay?

534
00:26:39,775 --> 00:26:40,817
Overpitched.

535
00:26:42,025 --> 00:26:45,608
First take your stance
and keep your eyes on the ball.

536
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,108
What a shot, Sir!
Amazing!

537
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:55,150
What a shot, Sir!
What a shot Sir!

538
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,192
This was overpitched.

539
00:26:57,567 --> 00:26:59,942
If you bowl like this,
anyone would hit a six.

540
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,983
What did I say? Short ball.

541
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,608
No problem, try again.

542
00:27:04,192 --> 00:27:04,817
Come on.

543
00:27:04,983 --> 00:27:06,775
Off side, short ball, okay?

544
00:27:07,817 --> 00:27:09,358
Do as I had instructed before.

545
00:27:09,438 --> 00:27:10,525
Okay?

546
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,317
Come on, Son.

547
00:27:22,228 --> 00:27:23,483
Very good bowling.

548
00:27:24,182 --> 00:27:25,442
I've taught you well.

549
00:27:26,725 --> 00:27:27,942
Saw that?
Take notes.

550
00:27:28,067 --> 00:27:29,483
- Sorry, Sir.
- Just like Bumrah

551
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:31,775
Very good son. Very good.

552
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:33,400
Your turn now.
Very good.

553
00:27:34,855 --> 00:27:35,567
Carry on.

554
00:27:38,317 --> 00:27:41,567
I got out on purpose,
to boost his confidence.

555
00:27:42,317 --> 00:27:42,900
Carry on.

556
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,525
So from Mahinder Sir's
dismissal we learn that,

557
00:27:47,817 --> 00:27:50,025
you shouldn't decide
the shot beforehand.

558
00:27:50,483 --> 00:27:52,483
You should decide the shot
after you have judged the ball.

559
00:27:53,317 --> 00:27:56,775
There are some deliveries
that you don't hit, you defend

560
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:58,733
otherwise,
you end up losing your wicket.

561
00:28:37,817 --> 00:28:41,483
"I find myself lost
in the web of your eyes"

562
00:28:41,608 --> 00:28:44,067
"Oh baby,
Without even asking I'm yours"

563
00:28:44,192 --> 00:28:46,862
"I so want to touch your rosy cheeks"

564
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:49,608
"I seek your permission today,
please"

565
00:28:49,733 --> 00:28:52,275
"You secretly keep looking at me"

566
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,817
"Come on,
it's time you confess openly"

567
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,400
"I keep apologizing for no reason"

568
00:28:57,525 --> 00:29:10,997
"Oh your stealthiness."

569
00:29:23,358 --> 00:29:27,942
"Your tantrums are as big as mountains"

570
00:29:28,025 --> 00:29:33,442
"I'm tired of counting,
your multiple facets"

571
00:29:34,525 --> 00:29:39,025
"Your tantrums are as big as mountains"

572
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:44,942
"I'm tired of counting,
your multiple facets"

573
00:29:45,275 --> 00:29:48,067
"I think of you the whole day"

574
00:29:48,192 --> 00:29:50,862
"I have forgotten everyone
else in this world"

575
00:29:50,942 --> 00:29:53,275
"I have rejected so
many girls for you..."

576
00:29:53,400 --> 00:30:08,202
"Oh your stealthiness."

577
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,067
Oh!

578
00:30:12,025 --> 00:30:12,817
Hey, you...

579
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:22,900
Ms. Neelima, I wanted to talk to you.

580
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:27,900
About what?

581
00:30:29,233 --> 00:30:30,900
- Well...
- You want to apologize?

582
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,525
You have understood your mistake?

583
00:30:35,608 --> 00:30:36,733
You feel embarrassed?

584
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:38,567
You have mended your ways?

585
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:40,692
You won't do such a thing every again?

586
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,358
You want to be my friend?

587
00:30:45,317 --> 00:30:46,400
Yes.

588
00:30:47,317 --> 00:30:48,650
Buy me a drink?

589
00:30:51,858 --> 00:30:53,442
Is that a yes or a no?

590
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:55,442
No, yes.
Yes.

591
00:30:55,858 --> 00:30:56,858
Six in the evening today.

592
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,567
Two lanes after Shaheed Park.

593
00:31:02,858 --> 00:31:04,858
Shaheed Park.

594
00:31:08,942 --> 00:31:09,817
Drinks!

595
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:27,358
Mom?

596
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:28,108
Yeah?

597
00:31:28,317 --> 00:31:29,400
Where's the seat kept?

598
00:31:29,525 --> 00:31:31,483
- Which seat?
- The pillion seat.

599
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:32,483
It was removed.

600
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:35,233
I know that.
But where did you keep it.

601
00:31:35,483 --> 00:31:36,775
Your dad would know.

602
00:31:36,942 --> 00:31:37,900
Listen?

603
00:31:38,942 --> 00:31:39,900
Listen?

604
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:41,442
Where's the seat?

605
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:42,608
I removed it.

606
00:31:42,858 --> 00:31:44,358
I know that.

607
00:31:44,483 --> 00:31:46,192
Montu wants to know
where have you kept it.

608
00:31:46,317 --> 00:31:46,900
Why?

609
00:31:47,067 --> 00:31:48,150
I want to put it back.

610
00:31:48,275 --> 00:31:49,525
But I don't want to.

611
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,400
Dad, I need to go somewhere and
I want it. You can take it off later.

612
00:31:52,525 --> 00:31:54,233
But why do you need the seat?

613
00:31:54,358 --> 00:31:55,900
I need to take someone along Dad.

614
00:31:55,983 --> 00:31:57,192
Please just tell me,
where have you kept it?

615
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,942
It's none of your business.

616
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:01,858
Mom...

617
00:32:02,025 --> 00:32:05,483
Ask the one who is going
with you to get a pillow.

618
00:32:05,942 --> 00:32:07,942
- I cannot do that!
- Oh, come on.

619
00:32:08,212 --> 00:32:10,067
- Found it?
- So tell me, where do we meet?

620
00:32:10,192 --> 00:32:11,900
Crawl into your phone only one day.
Find it!

621
00:32:12,483 --> 00:32:13,858
You should call for a pillow.

622
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:15,567
Look behind that basket.

623
00:32:16,025 --> 00:32:17,358
It's not here, brother.

624
00:32:17,567 --> 00:32:19,317
Get down, Bablu.

625
00:32:19,442 --> 00:32:21,025
I'll find it, Dad.

626
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:23,900
Get down, son.
You will get hurt if you fall.

627
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,900
He can also end up
with a splinter in his backside.

628
00:32:26,025 --> 00:32:28,275
As if he'll die if a splinter
pricks him. Let him get hurt

629
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:28,900
Find it.

630
00:32:28,983 --> 00:32:29,942
Wait a minute

631
00:32:30,067 --> 00:32:30,858
What are you doing?

632
00:32:30,942 --> 00:32:32,358
What are you doing, Dad?

633
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:34,733
Let me climb up.
Very good.

634
00:32:35,192 --> 00:32:36,067
He jumps well.

635
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,317
- Be careful.
- Hold the ladder.

636
00:32:39,442 --> 00:32:40,483
There are rats up there.

637
00:32:40,608 --> 00:32:42,358
- I'll check.
- It's all because of brother.

638
00:32:42,483 --> 00:32:44,483
The ladder is creaking,
please get down.

639
00:32:45,608 --> 00:32:46,358
Found it.

640
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,358
- Found it.
- Give it here.

641
00:32:50,406 --> 00:32:51,483
Here, found it.

642
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,858
Hold it steady.

643
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,900
I only look fat.

644
00:32:55,692 --> 00:32:57,525
Inside it's just gas.

645
00:32:58,775 --> 00:32:59,692
Very good.

646
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,192
Rats are really a nuisance.
They nibbled on the seat.

647
00:33:31,192 --> 00:33:32,442
Wait, it will start.

648
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,608
Can you give it a slight push?

649
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:47,650
Let it go when I ask you to.

650
00:33:47,858 --> 00:33:48,608
Let it go now.

651
00:33:54,275 --> 00:33:54,942
Come.

652
00:33:57,901 --> 00:33:59,025
Yeah, come this way.

653
00:34:06,608 --> 00:34:08,358
Happy birthday...

654
00:34:09,983 --> 00:34:12,608
That's Dimpy, Shukla Ji...

655
00:34:14,858 --> 00:34:16,608
So how did you like it? The arrangement?

656
00:34:18,733 --> 00:34:20,150
Is this where you drink every day?

657
00:34:21,067 --> 00:34:22,400
In a secluded corner?

658
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,858
No.

659
00:34:25,483 --> 00:34:27,108
I'm sure you must be having
it in the open, unabashed.

660
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:28,317
Of course.

661
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:32,483
But you can't with me.

662
00:34:32,858 --> 00:34:35,525
No. I mean it's not...

663
00:34:38,192 --> 00:34:39,858
Don't you have any other place?

664
00:34:42,442 --> 00:34:44,900
Of course, we do.
Fully air. Just five minutes.

665
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:57,150
Cheers?

666
00:34:58,192 --> 00:34:58,942
Cheers.

667
00:35:14,483 --> 00:35:16,153
Ms. Neelu, you...

668
00:35:16,233 --> 00:35:19,900
Sir, please don't be so formal with me.

669
00:35:21,608 --> 00:35:23,567
Neelu, you have studied from Delhi.

670
00:35:23,983 --> 00:35:25,858
Then how did you end
up becoming a teacher?

671
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:26,692
Why?

672
00:35:27,442 --> 00:35:28,775
Is being a teacher
not a good thing?

673
00:35:30,858 --> 00:35:31,733
Well...

674
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:35,442
As a student, I used to teach
computers to cover my expenses.

675
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,983
I started enjoying teaching.

676
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,858
So, I became a teacher.

677
00:35:40,067 --> 00:35:41,317
Oh, I see.

678
00:35:42,942 --> 00:35:44,400
Do you like kids?

679
00:35:46,275 --> 00:35:46,775
Yes.

680
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:52,983
Why did you become a PTI?

681
00:35:54,442 --> 00:35:56,275
I actually wanted to pursue law
but couldn't really do it.

682
00:35:56,567 --> 00:35:58,608
Then everyone suggested that
I should get a degree in Education.

683
00:35:58,733 --> 00:36:00,525
I thought it wasn't my cup of tea.

684
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:03,233
So then, Dad made a call to
Usha Madam and got me this PTI job.

685
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:04,692
My dad has great connections.

686
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:09,692
Neelu, they say those
who can't do, teach.

687
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,483
And those who can't teach,
become PTIs.

688
00:36:16,692 --> 00:36:17,900
Shukla Ji...

689
00:36:19,567 --> 00:36:21,858
So you have no interest
in physical education?

690
00:36:23,067 --> 00:36:24,567
It is important for the kids.

691
00:36:24,775 --> 00:36:26,650
No, it's not that I
am not interested in it.

692
00:36:26,983 --> 00:36:28,442
You see Neelu, here...

693
00:36:30,067 --> 00:36:32,150
- Ms. Neelima, no one here is...
- Neelu is fine.

694
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,567
- Ms. Neelu, no one here is...
- Just Neelu.

695
00:36:38,275 --> 00:36:38,983
Just?

696
00:36:41,775 --> 00:36:45,942
Neelu, no one here is interested
in sports or physical education.

697
00:36:46,067 --> 00:36:47,358
So even I'm laid-back about it.....

698
00:36:51,483 --> 00:36:54,650
But I'm quite concerned
about it even if no one else is.

699
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,775
When I saw the state
of the kids in the school...

700
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,067
the passion inside me came to life.

701
00:37:00,442 --> 00:37:01,025
Like you.

702
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:01,858
Well said.

703
00:37:02,317 --> 00:37:04,983
After all,
our student's future is at stake.

704
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:06,233
Right?

705
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,942
All rubbish.

706
00:37:09,942 --> 00:37:11,233
You are such a fraud.

707
00:37:17,608 --> 00:37:18,483
Make me another drink.

708
00:37:25,442 --> 00:37:29,983
I have to say, she is honest.

709
00:37:42,317 --> 00:37:44,442
By the way, I too like kids a lot.

710
00:38:01,775 --> 00:38:03,192
You know my lane also.

711
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,900
Yes, thanks to Shukla Ji.

712
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:08,108
Shukla Ji is smart.

713
00:38:08,983 --> 00:38:10,733
I think I should befriend him only.

714
00:38:12,025 --> 00:38:13,025
Come on.

715
00:38:13,442 --> 00:38:14,525
Okay, good night.

716
00:38:14,858 --> 00:38:15,692
Good night.

717
00:38:16,567 --> 00:38:17,900
Neelu?

718
00:38:18,942 --> 00:38:22,317
I apologize for the other day.

719
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,900
It's not okay,

720
00:38:27,442 --> 00:38:28,483
but it's okay.

721
00:38:32,067 --> 00:38:32,650
Bye.

722
00:38:53,525 --> 00:38:54,692
Feels good, doesn't it?

723
00:38:56,192 --> 00:38:57,233
Very good.

724
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:03,067
You must be feeling this sheer joy within?

725
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:12,108
You must be wondering when the sun would
rise, so that you can see her again.

726
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,358
Concentrate on your studies.

727
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,650
I speak from experience.

728
00:39:24,775 --> 00:39:26,275
You better make a move.

729
00:39:27,025 --> 00:39:28,900
Such girls don't stay single for long.

730
00:39:29,108 --> 00:39:30,233
You should propose to her.

731
00:39:30,483 --> 00:39:33,608
If someone else steps in, your
love story will become a love triangle.

732
00:39:34,067 --> 00:39:38,108
Or else, you'll be left blushing and
someone else will sweep her off her feet

733
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,275
Who can dare to take
her away from me now?

734
00:39:43,858 --> 00:39:45,358
Sister-in-law, hmmm?

735
00:39:46,611 --> 00:39:47,775
Come on now, switch off the light.

736
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,608
Why don't you ever listen to me?

737
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:57,525
Not the waist, not the waist. Good.
Don't move your hands like this.

738
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:00,103
Keep your hands straight.

739
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,275
What's this?

740
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,317
What does it look like to you?

741
00:40:04,775 --> 00:40:06,442
That someone is
conducting a sports class.

742
00:40:06,775 --> 00:40:08,775
And who usually does that?

743
00:40:09,483 --> 00:40:10,108
PTI.

744
00:40:15,108 --> 00:40:16,525
But I'm the PTI.

745
00:40:16,942 --> 00:40:18,650
That's what you think.

746
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:24,233
No, Usha can't do that.

747
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:27,525
Singh Sir,
Principal Madam has summoned you.

748
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:29,192
Singh Sir?

749
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,983
Montu, you too.

750
00:40:31,108 --> 00:40:31,858
It's Mahinder.

751
00:40:31,942 --> 00:40:32,942
Whatever, Mahinder.

752
00:40:33,067 --> 00:40:34,483
Singh Sir.

753
00:40:35,942 --> 00:40:38,100
Hold this, hold this, hold this.
Shukla Ji, hold this.

754
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:44,692
May I come in, Madam?

755
00:40:44,983 --> 00:40:46,153
- Please come in, Singh Sir.
- Hello.

756
00:40:46,233 --> 00:40:47,900
Please come in and have a seat.

757
00:40:52,192 --> 00:40:53,150
Good morning, Madam.

758
00:40:53,567 --> 00:40:54,733
Montu, have you met him?

759
00:40:55,275 --> 00:40:56,275
I.M. Singh.

760
00:40:56,815 --> 00:40:57,775
I'm Hooda.

761
00:40:58,567 --> 00:40:59,900
Inder Mohan Singh.

762
00:41:01,067 --> 00:41:02,525
And he's Montu.

763
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:06,942
From today,
you will have to assist Singh Sir.

764
00:41:07,483 --> 00:41:08,400
Why do I have to assist him?

765
00:41:08,525 --> 00:41:09,858
What do you mean by why?

766
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,237
We got a notification
from the state government,

767
00:41:12,317 --> 00:41:15,400
that from today onwards sports
will be a compulsory subject.

768
00:41:15,858 --> 00:41:17,820
Those schools whose
students perform well in sports

769
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:22,233
at the state level,
will get a grant from the government.

770
00:41:22,942 --> 00:41:27,525
It's my dream that a new
wing opens here before I retire,...

771
00:41:27,775 --> 00:41:32,442
and Sir Choturam Secondary
School becomes Senior Secondary School.

772
00:41:32,733 --> 00:41:34,775
But even I can teach
the students, Madam.

773
00:41:34,942 --> 00:41:42,442
But Montu, Singh Sir graduated from Netaji
Subhash National Institute of Sports, Patiala.

774
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:44,775
- Did I get that right?
- Yes.

775
00:41:45,733 --> 00:41:46,900
He is qualified.

776
00:41:46,983 --> 00:41:48,025
He is experienced.

777
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,820
You'll learn a lot
if you'll work with him.

778
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,775
Where are you from?

779
00:41:52,067 --> 00:41:53,608
Here only. Behind the vegetable market.

780
00:41:53,733 --> 00:41:55,608
No, I mean where did
you get your education from?

781
00:41:55,733 --> 00:41:57,358
He's is an ex student
of this school only.

782
00:41:57,438 --> 00:41:57,778
Okay.

783
00:41:57,858 --> 00:41:59,025
He's like a son to me.

784
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,692
His father called me and
asked whether I could help him out.

785
00:42:03,025 --> 00:42:05,442
There was a vacancy so I hired him.

786
00:42:05,733 --> 00:42:07,608
And thus, he became a PTI.

787
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,025
This is what is happening
everywhere across the country.

788
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,858
Most people don't know,

789
00:42:11,938 --> 00:42:14,025
you actually require a
degree to become a PTI.

790
00:42:14,692 --> 00:42:16,150
Anyway, this situation
too shall change slowly.

791
00:42:16,608 --> 00:42:17,608
We will change it.

792
00:42:18,275 --> 00:42:19,067
We surely will.

793
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,900
I have another qualification.

794
00:42:21,525 --> 00:42:23,983
I have competed at the state level,
in Athletics.

795
00:42:24,233 --> 00:42:26,775
It's okay,
not everyone can make the cut.

796
00:42:27,275 --> 00:42:28,650
But we will make sure
that our students do.

797
00:42:30,858 --> 00:42:33,025
Madam, can I have a word with you,
in private?

798
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,692
I'll get going.

799
00:42:37,942 --> 00:42:39,692
I have just had one
class with some students.

800
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,192
They are very weak.

801
00:42:41,983 --> 00:42:43,150
But I'll see how the
other students fare.

802
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:44,317
See you around.

803
00:42:47,275 --> 00:42:48,358
This is not fair, Madam.

804
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,150
How can you give my job to someone else?

805
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,275
That too without asking me.

806
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,567
What do you mean without asking?

807
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,108
I didn't give him your job.

808
00:42:54,358 --> 00:42:55,692
I haven't fired you.

809
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,692
Don't worry.

810
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,317
Your salary will remain the same.

811
00:43:00,397 --> 00:43:02,442
And you will also get extra
commission for the weddings.

812
00:43:02,567 --> 00:43:04,275
After all,
you will be the one handling them.

813
00:43:04,567 --> 00:43:08,233
You anyway didn't take
the coaching seriously.

814
00:43:08,313 --> 00:43:09,108
But...

815
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:15,650
The thing is madam,
I'm giving you one week.

816
00:43:16,192 --> 00:43:19,983
If you still think that he
should be the PTI then I'll resign.

817
00:43:20,192 --> 00:43:21,567
You can make him
handle the weddings too.

818
00:43:21,692 --> 00:43:23,108
He'll only get the mattresses for you.

819
00:43:24,358 --> 00:43:25,942
Netaji Subhash Patiala!

820
00:43:29,817 --> 00:43:33,317
Tell me, will there be a pay cut?

821
00:43:34,942 --> 00:43:36,733
Then what's the problem?

822
00:43:37,317 --> 00:43:40,900
You'll get the salary of a PTI
with the work profile of an assistant.

823
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,900
Listen, let's have him kidnapped.

824
00:43:44,567 --> 00:43:45,692
And then what will you do?

825
00:43:45,983 --> 00:43:46,650
Weightlifting?

826
00:43:46,858 --> 00:43:49,149
We can decide that after we abduct him.

827
00:43:49,775 --> 00:43:51,692
I'll slap him silly right here.

828
00:43:52,275 --> 00:43:53,358
Want me to break his bones?

829
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,192
How about an accident?

830
00:43:55,442 --> 00:43:56,775
Wait, let me just call Nagar.

831
00:43:56,983 --> 00:44:00,483
Hey, you don't become a gangster
just by watching gangster movies.

832
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,067
You are just a cook.
Don't forget your standing.

833
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,150
No problem.

834
00:44:05,567 --> 00:44:08,400
We'll feed him laxative laced food.

835
00:44:08,608 --> 00:44:11,608
- He'd have no option but to run.
- Stop it. Zip it.

836
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:13,900
I'll handle it.
You leave it.

837
00:44:14,442 --> 00:44:15,942
Whatever.

838
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,233
Bro, I have decided,

839
00:44:21,317 --> 00:44:22,442
I will talk to Usha.

840
00:44:23,108 --> 00:44:24,192
English.

841
00:44:25,692 --> 00:44:29,070
Shukla Ji, your fake confidence
has already screwed up your life,

842
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:30,442
now it'll screw up mine.

843
00:44:31,317 --> 00:44:35,067
Please do me a favour, take
that fake confidence of yours and...

844
00:44:43,817 --> 00:44:45,900
As far as one's standing is concerned,

845
00:44:46,942 --> 00:44:49,983
I was a cook yesterday,
and I'm one today.

846
00:44:51,025 --> 00:44:54,733
You were a PTI yesterday,
who is just an assistant today.

847
00:44:58,025 --> 00:44:58,733
Hey.

848
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:01,692
Bro, I have decided,

849
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:04,692
I will not talk to Usha.

850
00:45:05,192 --> 00:45:05,942
Hey!

851
00:45:06,483 --> 00:45:08,108
What is wrong with both of you?

852
00:45:21,692 --> 00:45:22,858
- Madam?
- Yes?

853
00:45:22,942 --> 00:45:24,733
Have you seen Neelu... Neelima Madam?

854
00:45:24,858 --> 00:45:25,900
No.

855
00:45:26,483 --> 00:45:27,817
- You haven't?
- No.

856
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:47,858
Move aside.

857
00:46:06,067 --> 00:46:07,108
- So I didn't come to the college only, otherwise..
- Oh.

858
00:46:07,233 --> 00:46:08,233
What are you two talking about?

859
00:46:08,525 --> 00:46:09,317
Hi, Montu.

860
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:10,400
You know it's such
a pleasant coincidence,

861
00:46:10,525 --> 00:46:13,025
Singh Sir is also a graduate
of Kurukshetra University.

862
00:46:13,192 --> 00:46:14,400
He was my super senior.

863
00:46:14,664 --> 00:46:15,858
But we never bumped into each other.

864
00:46:15,942 --> 00:46:18,067
I regret missing out on that opportunity.

865
00:46:20,275 --> 00:46:21,942
I want to talk to you, in private.

866
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:23,608
What is going on, Mr. Montu?

867
00:46:23,983 --> 00:46:25,567
You keep having a
lot of private meetings,

868
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,233
first Principal
Madam and now Ms. Neelima.

869
00:46:28,108 --> 00:46:29,525
You'll soon have to
start explaining yourself.

870
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,692
Anyway, you guys carry on.

871
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,567
- I'll see you later, Neelima?
- Okay.

872
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:37,608
I can call you Neelima, right?
I'm your super senior.

873
00:46:37,858 --> 00:46:38,775
Call me Neelu.

874
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:40,344
Okay, Neelu.

875
00:46:42,692 --> 00:46:43,358
So, what is it?

876
00:46:45,525 --> 00:46:46,525
What were you two talking about?

877
00:46:47,067 --> 00:46:47,942
Nothing.

878
00:46:50,525 --> 00:46:51,275
So?

879
00:46:52,192 --> 00:46:52,650
What?

880
00:46:53,025 --> 00:46:53,942
You wanted to talk to me.

881
00:46:54,358 --> 00:46:55,067
Right.

882
00:46:56,108 --> 00:46:57,317
What are your plans for this evening?

883
00:46:57,733 --> 00:46:58,275
Why?

884
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,358
No, I wanted to talk to you.

885
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:01,817
Then why not talk now?

886
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,608
No, I don't want to hurry this up.

887
00:47:05,608 --> 00:47:06,400
Dinner?

888
00:47:07,067 --> 00:47:08,275
Dinner will be too late.

889
00:47:08,775 --> 00:47:10,525
Yes, dinner will be too late.

890
00:47:11,817 --> 00:47:12,567
Snacks then?

891
00:47:13,525 --> 00:47:13,942
Okay.

892
00:47:14,567 --> 00:47:16,650
Pick me up from the same
place as last time at four.

893
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:17,358
Hmm?

894
00:47:17,567 --> 00:47:18,192
Okay.

895
00:47:19,108 --> 00:47:20,775
I know a place that
serves amazing snacks.

896
00:47:21,275 --> 00:47:22,858
But please don't tell Dimpy.

897
00:47:23,212 --> 00:47:25,275
He'll feel offended that I
have snacks from somewhere else also.

898
00:47:27,025 --> 00:47:27,900
You are cute.

899
00:47:27,983 --> 00:47:28,525
Huh?

900
00:47:28,692 --> 00:47:29,108
Cute?

901
00:47:29,858 --> 00:47:31,233
Dimpy thinks I'm hot.

902
00:47:31,942 --> 00:47:33,442
Neelu, can I drop you home?

903
00:47:33,567 --> 00:47:34,567
Sure.

904
00:47:34,692 --> 00:47:36,338
- Come.
- Let's go. Bye. I'll see you, Montu.

905
00:47:38,275 --> 00:47:38,817
Bye.

906
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:40,612
-Shall we?
- Do you know where I stay?

907
00:47:40,692 --> 00:47:42,567
Yes of course, I'm sure
it must be on the way somewhere.

908
00:47:42,692 --> 00:47:44,025
It cannot be outside the town.

909
00:47:51,317 --> 00:47:53,150
So what were you
and Singh talking about?

910
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,317
You need to stop obsessing over it.

911
00:47:58,817 --> 00:48:02,108
Fine, I have some work.
Please come with me.

912
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:03,192
What is it?

913
00:48:03,317 --> 00:48:04,275
Just come with me.

914
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:12,317
Welcome.
Hello.

915
00:48:12,608 --> 00:48:13,817
- Please have a seat.
- Sit.

916
00:48:13,983 --> 00:48:14,942
Please make yourself comfortable.

917
00:48:16,275 --> 00:48:18,025
- What would you like to see?
- A ring.

918
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,525
A diamond ring.

919
00:48:20,525 --> 00:48:21,858
I'm thinking about buying one for Mom.

920
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:24,233
She keeps asking Dad
for it so... a surprise.

921
00:48:25,067 --> 00:48:26,403
Okay. Her ring size?

922
00:48:26,483 --> 00:48:27,650
Her ring size?

923
00:48:28,983 --> 00:48:31,237
Mom's hands are just like yours.
You should try them.

924
00:48:31,317 --> 00:48:32,817
I'll buy a size close to yours.

925
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:34,442
Show them in her size.

926
00:48:37,775 --> 00:48:38,650
Have a look.

927
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:44,275
No, not in this one,
put it in that finger.

928
00:48:44,775 --> 00:48:45,942
Mom's married.

929
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:52,233
How about this one?

930
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,358
What have you thought about the job?

931
00:48:55,481 --> 00:48:56,942
Show me something more expensive.

932
00:49:00,317 --> 00:49:03,067
Why don't you try talking
to Principal Madam again?

933
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,150
It makes no difference to her.

934
00:49:06,442 --> 00:49:09,650
If it did, she would've talked
to me before appointing Singh.

935
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:13,442
It's just an excuse.
She and I, we go way back.

936
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,942
I don't want to work
where I'm not respected.

937
00:49:17,817 --> 00:49:18,817
Respect comes first.

938
00:49:19,442 --> 00:49:21,275
You are just being negative.

939
00:49:22,108 --> 00:49:23,275
Why don't you assist him?

940
00:49:23,692 --> 00:49:25,192
Maybe it'll end up benefitting you.

941
00:49:26,817 --> 00:49:30,567
It's not like you'll need to change your
visiting card from PTI to Assistant PTI.

942
00:49:33,733 --> 00:49:34,942
Salary too will remain the same.

943
00:49:43,608 --> 00:49:45,025
First get your job sorted,

944
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,567
then you can buy the ring.

945
00:49:48,692 --> 00:49:49,733
For your mom.

946
00:49:51,233 --> 00:49:52,025
Let's go?

947
00:49:55,608 --> 00:49:56,567
We'll drop by later.

948
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:57,608
Okay.

949
00:49:57,983 --> 00:49:59,608
Madam, I accept your offer.

950
00:50:00,483 --> 00:50:02,942
So tell me Coach Sir,
what do I need to do?

951
00:50:08,942 --> 00:50:11,150
Keep doing it. Your legs need
to move to the front and then back.

952
00:50:11,692 --> 00:50:12,483
Sir, you too should try it.

953
00:50:12,608 --> 00:50:14,150
It will loosen your muscles,
help you warm up.

954
00:50:14,317 --> 00:50:15,442
Come on, do it.

955
00:50:20,942 --> 00:50:21,900
What are you doing?

956
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:22,567
Huh?

957
00:50:22,647 --> 00:50:23,733
Who taught you this technique?

958
00:50:23,858 --> 00:50:25,067
Sir, Montu Sir.

959
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:28,650
Never mind.
Give me that.

960
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,067
You are playing it like this.

961
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:32,278
Okay?

962
00:50:32,358 --> 00:50:34,108
This could get you out because
you're not in control of the shot.

963
00:50:34,483 --> 00:50:36,775
Lift your bat,
place your leg in front, neck straight.

964
00:50:36,942 --> 00:50:38,442
The ball should go in the
direction of your toe's tip.

965
00:50:38,567 --> 00:50:40,358
Got it?
Come on, do it again.

966
00:50:42,025 --> 00:50:43,858
Your knees should touch your chest.

967
00:50:43,942 --> 00:50:45,567
Okay? Touch it. Do it properly.

968
00:50:45,733 --> 00:50:47,317
Sir, wait.

969
00:50:47,942 --> 00:50:48,900
Give me that.

970
00:50:48,983 --> 00:50:50,942
You can now do it comfortably.
There will be no hindrances.

971
00:50:51,942 --> 00:50:52,983
Keep going.

972
00:50:58,317 --> 00:50:59,400
Grab him Navjot, grab him.

973
00:50:59,567 --> 00:51:01,025
Oh no.
What are you doing?

974
00:51:01,942 --> 00:51:03,733
Your technique is all wrong.
Who taught you this?

975
00:51:04,483 --> 00:51:06,237
What are you doing, Navjyot? Just hold
his leg and bring him to the ground.

976
00:51:06,317 --> 00:51:07,233
Montu Sir...

977
00:51:07,442 --> 00:51:08,612
- Let me explain it to them.
- Push him to the ground and tackle him.

978
00:51:08,692 --> 00:51:10,150
Montu Sir, I'll show it to them.
Please come here.

979
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:12,192
You too can watch and learn.
Please stand here.

980
00:51:12,692 --> 00:51:13,900
Now watch me.
Come here, kiddo.

981
00:51:14,108 --> 00:51:14,942
Now this is what you're doing.

982
00:51:15,025 --> 00:51:15,942
You're holding him like this.

983
00:51:16,067 --> 00:51:17,358
Leave. Run away.

984
00:51:17,942 --> 00:51:18,858
He can easily escape.

985
00:51:19,358 --> 00:51:20,442
Let's try it again.

986
00:51:20,817 --> 00:51:22,233
Here he comes,
you shift and drag him in.

987
00:51:22,442 --> 00:51:22,942
Go.

988
00:51:24,317 --> 00:51:25,192
Got it?

989
00:51:25,692 --> 00:51:26,653
Got it, Sir?

990
00:51:26,733 --> 00:51:28,692
You see, we need to teach
them right when they are young,

991
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,067
otherwise,
they'll never be able to play it right.

992
00:51:33,067 --> 00:51:35,733
Sir, please step outside the court,
the game is on.

993
00:51:37,858 --> 00:51:38,900
Go for it again.

994
00:51:39,108 --> 00:51:41,608
Your hands go up completely.
Come on, come on.

995
00:51:41,733 --> 00:51:43,900
Higher Sir, the kids are watching you.
Come on, keep jumping.

996
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:45,608
Everyone, keep jumping.

997
00:52:03,192 --> 00:52:06,400
Bablu, focus on the work, not the girl

998
00:52:06,858 --> 00:52:08,817
Otherwise, you'll end up losing both.

999
00:52:10,067 --> 00:52:11,733
I'm focusing on work only, Sir.

1000
00:52:12,108 --> 00:52:12,858
Oh really?

1001
00:52:13,108 --> 00:52:13,900
Attitude?

1002
00:52:14,733 --> 00:52:15,650
Step back.

1003
00:52:16,025 --> 00:52:17,983
Come on, run in and touch
and then go back. Come on.

1004
00:52:27,275 --> 00:52:28,567
What happened? You fell?

1005
00:52:28,864 --> 00:52:30,442
Come on, get up.
Try again.

1006
00:52:30,692 --> 00:52:31,650
Come on.

1007
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,233
Try a toe touch, toe touch.

1008
00:52:34,108 --> 00:52:34,775
Toe touch.

1009
00:52:43,442 --> 00:52:45,275
Stop struggling and give up.

1010
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,567
No.

1011
00:52:46,775 --> 00:52:48,942
Come on, give up.
That's enough.

1012
00:52:49,442 --> 00:52:52,275
When winning is beyond you,
you should just accept defeat.

1013
00:52:55,692 --> 00:52:56,900
He got your point, Sir. Let him go.

1014
00:52:57,067 --> 00:52:59,108
Sir, I need to teach
him how to lose gracefully.

1015
00:53:00,983 --> 00:53:03,233
Moreover, a player should
always know where he stands.

1016
00:53:04,233 --> 00:53:07,067
And people here have massive egos.

1017
00:53:08,192 --> 00:53:09,442
It's not a good thing
for a sportsman to have.

1018
00:53:09,567 --> 00:53:10,900
Don't worry, they will slowly lose it.

1019
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:19,067
Come on, give up.

1020
00:53:26,465 --> 00:53:27,192
Get up.

1021
00:53:27,554 --> 00:53:28,317
Get up.

1022
00:53:28,942 --> 00:53:30,775
- Are you okay? Huh?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

1023
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,608
Why are you dragging him into this?

1024
00:53:35,151 --> 00:53:36,358
Why don't you come after me instead?

1025
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:00,275
What's all this?

1026
00:54:00,733 --> 00:54:01,858
Why don't you ask him?

1027
00:54:02,233 --> 00:54:03,692
He was venting his anger out on a kid.

1028
00:54:03,772 --> 00:54:04,983
Why would I do that?

1029
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:07,442
I was teaching the students
the way I know is right.

1030
00:54:07,821 --> 00:54:09,150
He's the one holding a grudge.

1031
00:54:09,733 --> 00:54:12,567
All the students are witness to the fact
that he raised his hand on me for no reason.

1032
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:14,942
What is this nonsense, Montu?

1033
00:54:15,442 --> 00:54:17,567
Apologize to Singh Sir, Now!

1034
00:54:21,275 --> 00:54:22,400
Madam, I care for my job...

1035
00:54:23,108 --> 00:54:24,317
...but more for my self-respect.

1036
00:54:41,192 --> 00:54:41,983
Hello, Uncle.

1037
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:42,942
You?

1038
00:54:43,608 --> 00:54:44,692
What are you doing here?

1039
00:54:45,317 --> 00:54:46,317
I wanted to talk to Neelu.

1040
00:54:46,498 --> 00:54:48,900
Get out of here.

1041
00:54:48,983 --> 00:54:50,442
Want to talk to Neelu!

1042
00:54:50,522 --> 00:54:51,150
Get out!

1043
00:54:51,275 --> 00:54:53,028
- Please let bygones be bygones.
- Let bygones be bygones.

1044
00:54:53,108 --> 00:54:54,483
I have already apologized to Neelu.

1045
00:54:54,563 --> 00:54:55,025
So?

1046
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:56,983
- Neelu, you didn't tell him?
- You are done apologizing, right?

1047
00:54:57,108 --> 00:54:58,858
- Now get out of here.
- Please hear me out.

1048
00:54:59,025 --> 00:55:00,317
- Don't worry.
- Go on.

1049
00:55:00,608 --> 00:55:02,317
I'll keep your daughter very happy.

1050
00:55:02,442 --> 00:55:04,150
You'll have grandchildren...
Hello, Aunty.

1051
00:55:04,275 --> 00:55:06,442
- How dare you...
- At least hear me out.

1052
00:55:06,522 --> 00:55:08,298
- I'll beat you up.
- Fine, hit me and get it over with.

1053
00:55:08,442 --> 00:55:09,692
- Just hit me.
- Montu, don't.

1054
00:55:09,817 --> 00:55:10,942
- I apologized.
- Montu, zip it.

1055
00:55:11,025 --> 00:55:12,733
Dad, I'll talk to him. You go inside.

1056
00:55:13,334 --> 00:55:14,150
Go inside.

1057
00:55:14,317 --> 00:55:15,150
Okay, it's okay.

1058
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:17,233
- Go inside.
- It's okay.

1059
00:55:17,768 --> 00:55:18,858
- Take him inside.
- Sorry, Uncle.

1060
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:20,983
- I won't spare you, you dimwit.
- Sorry, Aunty.

1061
00:55:22,775 --> 00:55:24,025
- I wanted to talk...
- What were you doing?

1062
00:55:24,858 --> 00:55:25,942
What is this nonsense?

1063
00:55:26,733 --> 00:55:28,108
Neelu, remember you had asked,

1064
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:30,108
"If you like someone,
wouldn't you hold their hand?"

1065
00:55:30,254 --> 00:55:31,400
"Won't you sit next to them?"

1066
00:55:31,692 --> 00:55:32,942
"You'll take them home or to a hotel?"

1067
00:55:35,233 --> 00:55:36,983
I'm not one of those
who goes to hotels.

1068
00:55:37,608 --> 00:55:39,233
I will respectfully take you home.

1069
00:55:40,902 --> 00:55:42,608
I want to hold your hand so I've
come to ask for your hand in marriage

1070
00:55:45,602 --> 00:55:46,400
So what now?

1071
00:55:47,233 --> 00:55:47,942
Should we go?

1072
00:55:48,701 --> 00:55:49,567
Have kids?

1073
00:55:51,608 --> 00:55:52,317
What else do you want?

1074
00:55:52,442 --> 00:55:54,733
- What are you saying?
- No, tell me.

1075
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,150
Don't you love me?

1076
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:01,608
Huh?

1077
00:56:02,858 --> 00:56:04,942
Being in love and being open
to the possibility of falling in love

1078
00:56:05,025 --> 00:56:06,233
are two different things, Montu.

1079
00:56:07,567 --> 00:56:08,942
I like you.

1080
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:12,233
I need more to be in love, Montu.

1081
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:14,275
What do you need?

1082
00:56:15,608 --> 00:56:18,942
You need a job, a car, a home, money?
Tell me and I'll get it.

1083
00:56:19,358 --> 00:56:22,233
Montu, I don't want to lead a scrimpy
existence because of your frivolous thinking.

1084
00:56:22,313 --> 00:56:23,608
My frivolous thinking.

1085
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,817
My frivolous thinking, huh?

1086
00:56:27,442 --> 00:56:31,358
I tolerated getting insulted every
day at the job, only because of you.

1087
00:56:31,942 --> 00:56:33,192
You were doing that also for me?

1088
00:56:33,317 --> 00:56:34,025
Yes.

1089
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:36,317
Then quit your job.

1090
00:56:36,858 --> 00:56:38,900
Quit it if you were
doing it only for me.

1091
00:56:40,275 --> 00:56:41,317
I already did.

1092
00:56:42,025 --> 00:56:42,692
Very good.

1093
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:46,483
Now you should leave me as well.

1094
00:56:47,317 --> 00:56:49,650
Because eventually that's
what you are going to do.

1095
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:51,567
That's all you have ever done.

1096
00:57:03,567 --> 00:57:04,317
Thank you.

1097
00:57:48,858 --> 00:57:50,025
It's Scotch.

1098
00:57:51,608 --> 00:57:55,025
A client had gifted
it when I had won a case.

1099
00:57:57,817 --> 00:57:58,942
I'd thought,

1100
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:02,650
I'll open it with you one day.

1101
00:58:04,192 --> 00:58:06,942
But you always end up
drinking with your friends.

1102
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,858
Come on, have a drink with me today.

1103
00:58:13,983 --> 00:58:14,900
That's enough.

1104
00:58:17,412 --> 00:58:18,442
Cheers.

1105
00:58:33,192 --> 00:58:38,317
Montu, why are you
getting upset?

1106
00:58:40,067 --> 00:58:41,983
You can always take up another job.

1107
00:58:43,567 --> 00:58:45,025
This is not the only one.

1108
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:50,067
And you should quit if you cannot do it.

1109
00:58:54,192 --> 00:58:55,233
I should quit?

1110
00:58:58,567 --> 00:58:59,483
I already did.

1111
00:59:04,567 --> 00:59:06,025
I quit Cricket,

1112
00:59:06,817 --> 00:59:08,817
when I didn't get selected
for the under-15 team.

1113
00:59:11,108 --> 00:59:12,650
I quit Science,

1114
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:15,650
when I found Physics to be difficult.

1115
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:19,608
I quit Athletics,

1116
00:59:20,442 --> 00:59:22,233
when I didn't get selected
for the State team.

1117
00:59:24,275 --> 00:59:26,150
I quit Law Studies too,

1118
00:59:27,608 --> 00:59:29,817
because of the hefty books.

1119
00:59:34,025 --> 00:59:35,150
I always quit.

1120
00:59:42,233 --> 00:59:44,483
You must be so proud of me, Dad.

1121
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:48,858
Now one could compete with
your son when it came to quitting.

1122
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:54,942
I never lost...

1123
00:59:57,067 --> 00:59:58,358
always abandoned.

1124
01:00:00,192 --> 01:00:01,317
And game over.

1125
01:00:11,067 --> 01:00:11,942
Son!

1126
01:00:23,025 --> 01:00:25,567
There are at least 50 of them.
2000 with the 50...

1127
01:00:26,275 --> 01:00:27,608
Good that you are here as well.

1128
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:32,483
Madam, you hired him because you think
he is a better coach than me, right?

1129
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:37,817
Fine then. Choose any three sports.

1130
01:00:38,058 --> 01:00:39,608
He can even form his team first.

1131
01:00:39,942 --> 01:00:43,567
And after a month,
let us have a sports competition.

1132
01:00:44,067 --> 01:00:45,942
The winner keeps the job.

1133
01:00:46,562 --> 01:00:49,025
Montu, this is not a game.

1134
01:00:50,329 --> 01:00:53,275
Making such decisions isn't a joke.

1135
01:00:54,501 --> 01:00:56,108
This is not a game for me either, Madam.

1136
01:00:59,733 --> 01:01:00,733
This is not possible.

1137
01:01:00,813 --> 01:01:01,983
I don't have any problem with it, Madam.

1138
01:01:02,108 --> 01:01:03,567
That's not your decision to make.

1139
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:04,820
If he is saying that he doesn't
have a problem with it then...

1140
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:05,775
No, one moment.

1141
01:01:06,336 --> 01:01:07,442
Montu, hang on for a second.

1142
01:01:07,775 --> 01:01:10,567
Please excuse us,
I need to talk to her in private.

1143
01:01:27,094 --> 01:01:28,692
Shukla Ji, this is not right.

1144
01:01:29,108 --> 01:01:31,983
This is not right for the students.
This is not right for the school.

1145
01:01:32,567 --> 01:01:33,817
What will everyone think?

1146
01:01:33,897 --> 01:01:35,483
They will make fun of us.

1147
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:37,942
I left this chair 18 years ago,

1148
01:01:39,218 --> 01:01:40,733
the chair that you're sitting on today.

1149
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:45,567
Because back then I wasn't being able
to get a hold of my life.

1150
01:01:47,775 --> 01:01:50,192
You weren't the most senior.

1151
01:01:51,483 --> 01:01:56,067
No one here wanted a
woman to take this position.

1152
01:01:58,612 --> 01:02:00,108
But I supported you.

1153
01:02:02,942 --> 01:02:07,608
Sheila had just left
me and yet I supported you.

1154
01:02:09,317 --> 01:02:11,442
People had a lot to
say back then as well.

1155
01:02:12,608 --> 01:02:14,358
They had made fun of us even back then.

1156
01:02:15,442 --> 01:02:16,567
But I...

1157
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:18,983
I supported you

1158
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:22,692
because you believed that
you were capable for it.

1159
01:02:24,108 --> 01:02:26,483
And I believed in your belief.

1160
01:02:27,775 --> 01:02:31,942
And... you've handled it well,
that too for 18 years.

1161
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:35,317
Look Usha,

1162
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:38,358
Montu was your student.

1163
01:02:39,025 --> 01:02:40,900
An ex-student of this school.

1164
01:02:41,621 --> 01:02:43,233
An ex-student of your own school.

1165
01:02:43,504 --> 01:02:47,400
If you think, he isn't capable
enough to win then so be it.

1166
01:02:48,608 --> 01:02:50,608
But if you think,

1167
01:02:51,315 --> 01:02:53,483
he isn't even capable
enough to put up a fight,

1168
01:02:54,192 --> 01:02:59,025
then you should think what
that says about this school of yours.

1169
01:03:12,733 --> 01:03:13,858
Basketball.

1170
01:03:16,608 --> 01:03:18,608
400-meter Relay Race.

1171
01:03:27,817 --> 01:03:28,942
Kabaddi.

1172
01:03:32,483 --> 01:03:33,233
Okay.

1173
01:03:43,942 --> 01:03:45,108
Master Ji!

1174
01:03:47,733 --> 01:03:51,692
Master Ji, did you think
you would just waltz in here,

1175
01:03:51,858 --> 01:03:55,858
and take away the job,
the girl and the respect?

1176
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:57,608
Right?

1177
01:03:59,692 --> 01:04:01,567
Master Ji, this is Haryana.

1178
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,942
Our town.

1179
01:04:04,983 --> 01:04:06,650
This is not how it happens out here.

1180
01:04:08,025 --> 01:04:09,400
Of course.

1181
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,942
In his own territory,
even a dog acts like a lion.

1182
01:04:15,858 --> 01:04:16,817
You are right.

1183
01:04:18,108 --> 01:04:19,817
We are lions.

1184
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:25,108
Now get this. In our territory,...

1185
01:04:25,832 --> 01:04:27,400
...even outside lions are mere dogs.

1186
01:04:31,942 --> 01:04:33,858
You're in the wrong neighbourhood Master.

1187
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:37,942
But I'll teach you as well,
I'll teach you how to wag your tail.

1188
01:04:58,567 --> 01:05:02,233
Hu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu...

1189
01:05:27,331 --> 01:05:28,983
- Pratap Kumar.
- Yes, Sir.

1190
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:31,317
- Biren Dariyan.
- Sir.

1191
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:33,358
- Ravi Tomar.
- Yes, Sir.

1192
01:05:33,611 --> 01:05:35,704
I understand your need to challenge him.

1193
01:05:35,784 --> 01:05:37,028
- Piyush Jhangra
- Sir.

1194
01:05:37,108 --> 01:05:40,233
But I don't understand why
you let him form his team first.

1195
01:05:41,983 --> 01:05:44,775
Sir, I'm sure he will
play for your team, so I'll...

1196
01:05:44,855 --> 01:05:45,942
No, Sir.

1197
01:05:46,713 --> 01:05:48,317
You pick him if
you think he is capable.

1198
01:05:48,817 --> 01:05:50,942
He will play. For your team only.

1199
01:05:51,521 --> 01:05:53,150
And he will put in his best effort.

1200
01:05:53,608 --> 01:05:55,900
If he doesn't do that, let me know.

1201
01:05:56,486 --> 01:05:57,900
Bablu Hooda.

1202
01:05:58,942 --> 01:06:00,400
So Sir, this is my team.

1203
01:06:01,108 --> 01:06:04,567
You should keep a copy, so that
there's no confusion in the future.

1204
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:10,483
- Like I explained about the...
- Excuse us, Sir.

1205
01:06:15,192 --> 01:06:16,442
Hey, couch potato.

1206
01:06:19,358 --> 01:06:20,692
You, the backbencher.

1207
01:06:21,942 --> 01:06:23,692
Then take him as well.

1208
01:06:26,942 --> 01:06:28,192
Yeah. We'll work it out.

1209
01:06:29,567 --> 01:06:30,817
Team Montu!

1210
01:06:37,108 --> 01:06:37,983
These three.

1211
01:06:38,317 --> 01:06:40,233
Yeah, they are fine.

1212
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:45,400
And this one, Specky.

1213
01:06:45,608 --> 01:06:47,358
Looks perfect.

1214
01:06:48,233 --> 01:06:49,650
Both of you, stand up.

1215
01:06:50,733 --> 01:06:51,442
Perfect.

1216
01:06:51,733 --> 01:06:53,067
Meet me on the ground after class.

1217
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:55,150
- Let's go.
- Wait a second, Montu.

1218
01:06:55,942 --> 01:06:58,108
I think Lokesh will do well too.

1219
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:01,567
Fine, meet me on the ground after class.

1220
01:07:02,358 --> 01:07:03,275
So, what all games do you guys play?

1221
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,192
Sir, Seven Stones.

1222
01:07:04,317 --> 01:07:05,067
Sir, Ludo.

1223
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:06,108
Sir, Temple Run.

1224
01:07:06,233 --> 01:07:06,942
What run?

1225
01:07:07,108 --> 01:07:09,567
Temple Run, Sir.
That mobile phone game.

1226
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:10,942
Obviously.

1227
01:07:11,692 --> 01:07:14,275
From amongst you all we
will be forming three teams.

1228
01:07:14,525 --> 01:07:16,817
Relay Race, Basketball and Kabaddi.

1229
01:07:16,942 --> 01:07:18,775
Sir, I need to prepare for the Olympiad.

1230
01:07:18,942 --> 01:07:21,608
It's Olympics, not Olympiad, kiddo.

1231
01:07:21,943 --> 01:07:23,942
Let us first win the
school's competition,

1232
01:07:24,108 --> 01:07:25,233
then I'll take you to Olympics, okay?

1233
01:07:25,358 --> 01:07:28,067
Not Olympics, Olympiad sir.
Maths Olympiad.

1234
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:29,150
Ssshhh.

1235
01:07:30,942 --> 01:07:35,650
Montu, I must say,
you are very generous.

1236
01:07:36,108 --> 01:07:42,275
You handed the creme de
la creme of the school to Singh.

1237
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:49,483
Now he'll enjoy full cream milk while
you'll be stuck with double toned milk

1238
01:07:52,817 --> 01:07:56,608
Bro, I always say,

1239
01:07:56,942 --> 01:08:00,858
this over inflated
ego is never a good thing.

1240
01:08:01,692 --> 01:08:04,150
You need to be a little
practical as well.

1241
01:08:05,108 --> 01:08:08,942
I mean his pride is twice his size.

1242
01:08:09,275 --> 01:08:11,275
What do you expect will happen?
His pride is bound to crush him.

1243
01:08:12,817 --> 01:08:14,108
Hey...

1244
01:08:14,775 --> 01:08:19,233
It is this fake confidence of yours
that has screwed up everything for you.

1245
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:22,692
Now it's your turn to
take your fake confidence and...

1246
01:08:25,192 --> 01:08:28,567
Fine, even if because of my
ego I let him form his team first,

1247
01:08:29,525 --> 01:08:32,900
he should have at least had the
courtesy to keep the competition fair.

1248
01:08:32,983 --> 01:08:35,733
Finally, you have
at least accepted defeat.

1249
01:08:36,567 --> 01:08:37,942
I haven't accepted defeat.

1250
01:08:38,650 --> 01:08:40,275
But this competition is unfair.

1251
01:08:40,942 --> 01:08:43,067
And Neelu cannot see that.

1252
01:08:45,067 --> 01:08:49,233
Should I ask Neelu to talk
to Singh into giving me four students?

1253
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:52,233
He won't be able to say no to Neelu.

1254
01:08:52,692 --> 01:08:53,483
What say?

1255
01:08:53,983 --> 01:09:00,900
The way you fluctuate between being
a hero and a dimwit blows my mind away.

1256
01:09:01,650 --> 01:09:05,275
Four days ago, you were walking around
with your chest brimming with pride.

1257
01:09:05,983 --> 01:09:09,233
He was making tall claims
about domesticating a lion.

1258
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:12,692
And now, when Neelu is concerned
he has resorted to begging.

1259
01:09:12,942 --> 01:09:14,942
You are one confused man, a confused man.

1260
01:09:15,108 --> 01:09:15,775
Shukla Ji.

1261
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:19,817
Sir, Neelu has already chosen
the pillion seat of his bike.

1262
01:09:20,442 --> 01:09:22,317
So you might as well
forget about your love story.

1263
01:09:23,067 --> 01:09:25,858
Try to give him a tough competition
in at least one of the games.

1264
01:09:26,108 --> 01:09:27,442
You might perhaps
be able to save your job.

1265
01:09:27,567 --> 01:09:28,900
Neelu, sister-in-law.

1266
01:09:29,108 --> 01:09:33,525
That's right, it's time you start
referring to Singh as your elder brother.

1267
01:09:36,733 --> 01:09:39,108
Are you both on his team or mine?

1268
01:09:43,442 --> 01:09:44,775
Move aside, what's taking you so long?

1269
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:45,983
Can't you be patient?

1270
01:09:46,108 --> 01:09:47,108
Fine, have it!

1271
01:09:47,442 --> 01:09:48,275
He wants to drink water.

1272
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:49,400
How are you doing boys?

1273
01:09:50,942 --> 01:09:52,275
How's the training going?

1274
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,275
I hope Singh Sir's not being too strict.

1275
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:59,483
He's treating you guys
as nicely I used to. Right?

1276
01:10:00,483 --> 01:10:01,067
Ravi?

1277
01:10:01,317 --> 01:10:02,067
Yes, Sir.

1278
01:10:02,358 --> 01:10:04,400
He got a new basketball issued today.

1279
01:10:04,817 --> 01:10:06,317
Asked me to take it home.

1280
01:10:06,442 --> 01:10:08,567
He also asked us to make
a list of our shoe sizes.

1281
01:10:10,067 --> 01:10:11,525
Amazing.

1282
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:14,067
Basketball, shoes.

1283
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:17,192
So Singh Sir is only doing everything,

1284
01:10:18,483 --> 01:10:19,817
and I never did anything for you all?

1285
01:10:19,983 --> 01:10:20,942
Don't feel bad Sir.

1286
01:10:21,275 --> 01:10:22,900
We will surely play for your team
next year.

1287
01:10:23,275 --> 01:10:24,650
But will you be there next year?

1288
01:10:27,692 --> 01:10:28,900
Well done.

1289
01:10:30,567 --> 01:10:33,692
So this is the love left in a student's
heart for his favourite teacher now?

1290
01:10:35,525 --> 01:10:40,733
Back in our time, a student-teacher
relationship would last a lifetime.

1291
01:10:42,403 --> 01:10:43,775
Take Shukla Ji and me for example.

1292
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:45,233
How close we are.

1293
01:10:47,108 --> 01:10:49,775
And look at yourselves.

1294
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:50,858
What should we look at?

1295
01:10:51,067 --> 01:10:52,817
You are the one who
handed us over to him.

1296
01:10:52,942 --> 01:10:55,775
Even if I did, couldn't you have refused
and said you wanted to play for me?

1297
01:10:56,233 --> 01:10:56,900
Huh?

1298
01:10:58,275 --> 01:11:00,108
You didn't feel ashamed
standing next to him?

1299
01:11:02,317 --> 01:11:03,858
Didn't your soul hurt at the thought,

1300
01:11:03,983 --> 01:11:05,733
that you'll be wearing
a jersey with his name on it?

1301
01:11:06,358 --> 01:11:07,108
Singh?

1302
01:11:10,567 --> 01:11:12,108
Mine did.

1303
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:18,650
I couldn't have borne the
thought that he calls you his team.

1304
01:11:20,275 --> 01:11:21,942
And you call him your coach.

1305
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:26,775
I swear, if I had been in your place,

1306
01:11:27,608 --> 01:11:30,275
and I was given the best team
in the world, I would have said no.

1307
01:11:31,358 --> 01:11:35,608
Because this is my team, my students.

1308
01:11:38,108 --> 01:11:40,233
You guys don't have the courage
to go to Principal Madam,

1309
01:11:40,313 --> 01:11:42,442
and say that you'd
like to play for my team.

1310
01:11:44,483 --> 01:11:46,233
For your favourite teacher's team.

1311
01:11:53,108 --> 01:11:53,942
Fine.

1312
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:58,108
Sir.

1313
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:20,067
May I come in Ma'...

1314
01:12:20,775 --> 01:12:21,942
Yes, Montu?

1315
01:12:22,983 --> 01:12:24,108
What are they doing here?

1316
01:12:24,858 --> 01:12:26,067
Madam, we are here to say that...

1317
01:12:26,150 --> 01:12:27,775
They want to change their team, Madam.

1318
01:12:28,358 --> 01:12:29,487
They're saying, "We love you Montu Sir."

1319
01:12:29,567 --> 01:12:31,525
"We want to play for your
team and not for Singh Sirs'."

1320
01:12:31,753 --> 01:12:33,233
I'm tired of explaining it to them.

1321
01:12:33,317 --> 01:12:34,317
They just wouldn't listen.

1322
01:12:34,608 --> 01:12:35,858
They are acting like emotional fools.

1323
01:12:37,108 --> 01:12:38,108
Madam, please talk some sense into them.

1324
01:12:38,358 --> 01:12:39,525
Tell them that it is not possible.

1325
01:12:40,025 --> 01:12:44,108
Fools, love and ethics
are two different things.

1326
01:12:44,188 --> 01:12:45,108
Right?

1327
01:12:45,817 --> 01:12:48,858
Please don't listen to them.
Please don't.

1328
01:12:49,192 --> 01:12:50,817
You cannot do that.

1329
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:53,525
You will have to play
for Singh Sir's team.

1330
01:12:53,605 --> 01:12:57,108
If you do anything stupid,
then you'll be out of the competition.

1331
01:12:57,275 --> 01:12:58,612
- Heard that?
- That's what we have been trying to say, Ma'am.

1332
01:12:58,692 --> 01:13:00,525
Madam already said it.
Didn't you hear it?

1333
01:13:00,692 --> 01:13:02,570
Now go, go play for Singh Sir's team.

1334
01:13:02,650 --> 01:13:03,695
- Get moving.
- Okay, Sir.

1335
01:13:03,775 --> 01:13:05,358
- He too needs good players.
- Yes.

1336
01:13:05,483 --> 01:13:08,067
Go practice. Very good, very good.

1337
01:13:08,775 --> 01:13:11,567
- Emotional fools
- How mature of you, Montu.

1338
01:13:11,725 --> 01:13:12,483
Come on, Madam.

1339
01:13:12,650 --> 01:13:15,650
That was amazing, Mr. Mahinder.

1340
01:13:16,733 --> 01:13:17,900
Respect!

1341
01:13:19,567 --> 01:13:23,150
Cheating may be fair
in love Ma'am but not in war.

1342
01:13:41,608 --> 01:13:43,233
Everyone give me 20 push-ups.

1343
01:13:43,442 --> 01:13:44,650
Come on, come on, come on.

1344
01:13:45,067 --> 01:13:46,525
Start. One.

1345
01:13:47,483 --> 01:13:48,525
Two.

1346
01:13:49,192 --> 01:13:50,275
Four.

1347
01:13:50,775 --> 01:13:51,692
Five.

1348
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:52,858
Pull it up.

1349
01:13:52,942 --> 01:13:54,400
Do it properly.

1350
01:13:54,817 --> 01:13:56,775
Straight up.
You only need to do 20, come on.

1351
01:13:57,067 --> 01:13:58,192
It's not their cup of tea.

1352
01:13:58,317 --> 01:13:58,900
Three.

1353
01:13:59,358 --> 01:14:00,650
You, keep your pelvis straight.

1354
01:14:01,150 --> 01:14:01,817
Pelvis straight.

1355
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:09,108
Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi.
You need to say Kabaddi.

1356
01:14:09,317 --> 01:14:10,442
Form a chain.
How else do you plan to catch me?

1357
01:14:10,567 --> 01:14:11,442
Come on, form a chain.

1358
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:13,150
Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi.

1359
01:14:13,317 --> 01:14:15,067
You need to come towards me
as I move to that side.

1360
01:14:15,442 --> 01:14:18,525
Wriggle out of it and touch.
Got it? Now you try.

1361
01:14:18,733 --> 01:14:20,067
That's it. Come on, next.

1362
01:14:20,275 --> 01:14:21,150
Come on.

1363
01:14:23,817 --> 01:14:24,858
Yeah, that's it.

1364
01:14:25,275 --> 01:14:25,900
Go.

1365
01:14:27,192 --> 01:14:28,150
Don't you have any
strength in your arms?

1366
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:28,900
Go to the back of the line.

1367
01:14:28,983 --> 01:14:30,400
Technique is the most important thing.

1368
01:14:31,192 --> 01:14:33,775
No player can make progress
without a good technique.

1369
01:14:36,608 --> 01:14:37,233
Catch.

1370
01:14:38,983 --> 01:14:40,983
Catch it.
Is the ball going to bite you?

1371
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:43,525
Go, go, go!

1372
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:44,983
Don't stop. Keep going.

1373
01:14:45,317 --> 01:14:46,525
Move aside.

1374
01:14:54,942 --> 01:14:55,358
Up!

1375
01:14:55,817 --> 01:14:56,192
Down!

1376
01:14:56,692 --> 01:14:56,983
Up!

1377
01:15:01,483 --> 01:15:02,775
8 laps done!

1378
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:05,567
Come on! Fast, fast, fast.
We have to do 20.

1379
01:15:16,858 --> 01:15:18,150
Fast, fast, fast.

1380
01:15:18,442 --> 01:15:19,650
Move, move, move,

1381
01:15:19,942 --> 01:15:20,775
Go! Go!

1382
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:21,525
Go!

1383
01:15:24,567 --> 01:15:25,275
Yes.

1384
01:15:25,650 --> 01:15:26,275
Very good!

1385
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:29,900
Move, Move. Come on!

1386
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,108
Very good, very good.

1387
01:15:35,067 --> 01:15:36,650
Don't drop the ball. Go, go, go.

1388
01:15:36,942 --> 01:15:38,692
Don't make the circle smaller. Come on

1389
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:42,317
Faster, Faster, Faster

1390
01:15:42,397 --> 01:15:43,591
You guys are destined to die
with your heads buried inside books.

1391
01:15:43,671 --> 01:15:44,552
Cover the distance, cover the distance.

1392
01:15:44,632 --> 01:15:46,067
No one can teach you.

1393
01:15:47,817 --> 01:15:49,608
My team is filled with idiots.

1394
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:50,942
Come on.

1395
01:15:54,692 --> 01:15:55,692
What happened?

1396
01:15:56,567 --> 01:15:57,358
You got tired?

1397
01:15:58,567 --> 01:15:59,442
You cannot do it?

1398
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,733
You are at the wrong place.

1399
01:16:04,108 --> 01:16:06,067
Your Singh Sir's practice
is going on over there.

1400
01:16:07,736 --> 01:16:09,192
Go and participate in the Olympiad.

1401
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:12,817
Meet me outside the
institute in the evening.

1402
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:14,150
Why?

1403
01:16:14,775 --> 01:16:16,067
Did his bike break down?

1404
01:16:17,858 --> 01:16:18,817
At four.

1405
01:16:21,817 --> 01:16:22,858
I won't be coming.

1406
01:18:06,108 --> 01:18:08,067
A teacher's job is to teach.

1407
01:18:09,233 --> 01:18:11,942
Any teacher can take
a student from 90 to 100,...

1408
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:17,400
but only a good teacher
can take a student from 10 to 40.

1409
01:18:21,567 --> 01:18:22,567
I'm a teacher.

1410
01:18:23,108 --> 01:18:25,900
If I put in effort,
I can even make a donkey run the derby.

1411
01:18:46,733 --> 01:18:48,317
Where did all these
photographs come from?

1412
01:18:49,067 --> 01:18:53,692
Today, Bablu got all these old
photographs uploaded onto a pen drive.

1413
01:18:54,108 --> 01:18:55,400
So, I'm having a look at them.

1414
01:18:55,608 --> 01:18:57,275
- You want tea?
- No, no.

1415
01:18:58,192 --> 01:18:59,192
Let me help you with that.

1416
01:19:04,275 --> 01:19:06,650
Why are my hands in the
pockets in all these photographs?

1417
01:19:07,442 --> 01:19:11,275
As a kid you always used
to keep sucking your thumb.

1418
01:19:12,067 --> 01:19:14,442
I tried really hard to break your habit.

1419
01:19:15,317 --> 01:19:18,108
I slapped you,
applied chilli powder on your thumb,

1420
01:19:18,233 --> 01:19:19,650
but you didn't give it up.

1421
01:19:20,108 --> 01:19:22,775
Then one day I got an idea,

1422
01:19:23,442 --> 01:19:26,942
and made the elastic
of all your shorts loose.

1423
01:19:27,942 --> 01:19:30,983
After that, whenever you'd
put your thumb into your mouth,

1424
01:19:31,108 --> 01:19:32,900
your shorts would slip down.

1425
01:19:33,983 --> 01:19:36,400
So you'd keep holding
your shorts up all day long,

1426
01:19:36,483 --> 01:19:37,942
to make sure they don't slip down.

1427
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:39,900
That's how I managed
to break that habit of yours.

1428
01:19:41,525 --> 01:19:44,067
It is not easy to raise kids.

1429
01:19:44,817 --> 01:19:47,192
You will know when you'll
have to raise your own.

1430
01:19:47,942 --> 01:19:50,483
You need to apply
more brains than a sleuth.

1431
01:20:00,775 --> 01:20:01,650
Anyone hungry?

1432
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:03,275
Yes, Sir!

1433
01:20:04,192 --> 01:20:05,195
Who wants to eat guavas?

1434
01:20:05,275 --> 01:20:10,733
- I do, Sir.
- I do, Sir.

1435
01:20:12,317 --> 01:20:14,108
Have you ever plucked guavas
from this orchid and had them?

1436
01:20:14,192 --> 01:20:15,150
- No, Sir.
- No, Sir.

1437
01:20:15,358 --> 01:20:15,942
Really?

1438
01:20:16,358 --> 01:20:17,442
Then go, pluck them.

1439
01:20:17,885 --> 01:20:19,108
Go, they are very tasty.

1440
01:20:19,233 --> 01:20:20,150
Move it.

1441
01:20:25,233 --> 01:20:26,567
Guavas contain iron.

1442
01:20:27,442 --> 01:20:29,358
Over there.

1443
01:20:30,817 --> 01:20:31,983
That one.

1444
01:20:38,799 --> 01:20:39,483
Hello?

1445
01:20:39,563 --> 01:20:40,650
Mr. Ombir?

1446
01:20:41,192 --> 01:20:43,692
School kids are having
a blast in your guava orchid.

1447
01:20:44,608 --> 01:20:46,067
They have plucked all
the guavas from the trees.

1448
01:20:46,150 --> 01:20:47,192
Damn it.

1449
01:20:47,483 --> 01:20:49,150
Why the hell are you
guys still standing here?

1450
01:20:49,525 --> 01:20:51,275
Take the dogs and teach them a lesson.

1451
01:20:55,233 --> 01:20:57,775
Throw it.

1452
01:21:30,483 --> 01:21:31,900
Run! Run! Run!

1453
01:21:47,483 --> 01:21:49,650
- Run, kids!
- Run faster!

1454
01:21:51,986 --> 01:21:53,973
Quick, quick, quick.

1455
01:21:58,775 --> 01:22:02,067
Hurry up.
Faster, faster, faster.

1456
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:03,233
Cross it.

1457
01:22:29,483 --> 01:22:30,400
- Here.
- Sir.

1458
01:22:30,692 --> 01:22:32,150
It's the fruit of your labour only.

1459
01:22:36,525 --> 01:22:39,150
- I had to teach you guys how to run.
- Sir, we were really scared

1460
01:22:42,025 --> 01:22:42,858
Neelu?

1461
01:22:46,442 --> 01:22:47,400
Your work here is done.

1462
01:22:48,067 --> 01:22:49,608
Who'd like to go in there
to race with the dogs again?

1463
01:22:49,692 --> 01:22:52,525
- I will, Sir.
- I will go, Sir.

1464
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:53,567
You are choosing the wrong team, Neelu.

1465
01:22:55,651 --> 01:22:56,733
The team isn't complete yet..

1466
01:22:58,483 --> 01:22:59,650
It'll be formed now.

1467
01:23:19,775 --> 01:23:21,275
But isn't this competition
between boys, Neelu?

1468
01:23:21,733 --> 01:23:23,400
No, the competition is between students.

1469
01:23:24,067 --> 01:23:25,150
And this is a co-ed school.

1470
01:23:25,608 --> 01:23:27,025
These girls are
students of this school too.

1471
01:23:27,942 --> 01:23:30,275
Why did you become a teacher in a co-ed
school if you wanted to discriminate?

1472
01:23:31,817 --> 01:23:32,900
Sir, don't make them play.

1473
01:23:33,108 --> 01:23:34,608
They are nothing but
an unnecessary worry.

1474
01:23:34,942 --> 01:23:35,983
They will get hurt.

1475
01:23:36,233 --> 01:23:38,817
Just imagine,
what if someone pulls their plaits?

1476
01:23:41,942 --> 01:23:42,817
Let go.

1477
01:23:42,942 --> 01:23:44,192
I'm not the one holding.

1478
01:23:45,983 --> 01:23:47,525
Pinky, let him go

1479
01:23:59,108 --> 01:24:01,192
For every player, the three most
important things are

1480
01:24:01,608 --> 01:24:03,983
Speed. Stamina. Strength.

1481
01:24:04,983 --> 01:24:07,608
If even one of them is lacking,
means the player is lacking.

1482
01:24:08,108 --> 01:24:08,858
Understood?

1483
01:24:08,942 --> 01:24:09,817
Yes, Sir.

1484
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:10,817
What all?

1485
01:24:10,983 --> 01:24:11,858
Speed.

1486
01:24:11,942 --> 01:24:12,775
Stamina.

1487
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:13,775
Strength.

1488
01:24:14,192 --> 01:24:14,942
Very good.

1489
01:24:22,192 --> 01:24:23,608
Go, go, go. Put in more effort.

1490
01:24:24,025 --> 01:24:24,733
Put in more effort. Pull.

1491
01:24:26,483 --> 01:24:28,775
"Take a fall"

1492
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:30,525
"Pick a fight"

1493
01:24:31,275 --> 01:24:35,233
"Then commit yourself to your dreams"

1494
01:24:35,942 --> 01:24:37,775
"Take a fall"

1495
01:24:37,858 --> 01:24:40,108
- Done practicing with this for the day?
- "Pick a fight"

1496
01:24:40,233 --> 01:24:41,525
- Yes, Sir.
- Now practice with this.

1497
01:24:41,608 --> 01:24:44,817
"Then commit yourself to your dream"

1498
01:24:45,525 --> 01:24:47,862
"You can own the ground,"

1499
01:24:47,942 --> 01:24:50,358
"you just need to
rightfully demand"

1500
01:24:50,483 --> 01:24:51,525
Who all want to eat chicken?

1501
01:24:51,608 --> 01:24:52,733
- I do.
- "Take a fall"

1502
01:24:52,817 --> 01:24:54,275
"Pick a fight,
commit yourself to your dream"

1503
01:24:54,358 --> 01:24:56,858
If you want to eat them,
you'll have to catch them too.

1504
01:24:57,483 --> 01:24:58,275
Right?

1505
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:01,774
So I'll let them out,
all you need to do is catch them.

1506
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:06,954
"It's time to get ready"

1507
01:25:07,034 --> 01:25:13,675
"And take the leap"

1508
01:25:16,358 --> 01:25:23,115
"And take the leap"

1509
01:25:28,983 --> 01:25:29,817
Now, with this.

1510
01:25:30,358 --> 01:25:31,900
Come on. Pass.

1511
01:25:34,067 --> 01:25:37,150
Correct dribbling and concentration
are a must in Basketball.

1512
01:25:37,567 --> 01:25:39,608
So this is your court, start practicing.

1513
01:25:54,775 --> 01:25:56,900
- Bend this leg and take a single turn,
- "Whatever is prewritten"

1514
01:25:57,108 --> 01:25:59,192
- then lift your leg from here. Okay?
- "isn't absolute"

1515
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:00,442
Pay attention to Singh Sir.

1516
01:26:01,650 --> 01:26:02,775
He's teaching such a good technique.

1517
01:26:03,692 --> 01:26:04,192
Come on.

1518
01:26:04,275 --> 01:26:08,483
"Whatever is prewritten isn't absolute"

1519
01:26:09,025 --> 01:26:13,108
"You can shape your destiny
the way you want"

1520
01:26:13,733 --> 01:26:15,858
"He has asked you"

1521
01:26:16,150 --> 01:26:18,150
"So don't miss this opportunity"

1522
01:26:18,442 --> 01:26:20,858
"Take a hold of your destiny"

1523
01:26:20,942 --> 01:26:22,025
"Who has stopped you?"

1524
01:26:22,108 --> 01:26:23,108
Throw!

1525
01:26:23,192 --> 01:26:24,983
"Overcome the hurdles,"

1526
01:26:25,063 --> 01:26:27,900
"of your own making"

1527
01:26:27,983 --> 01:26:34,727
"It's time to get ready"

1528
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:41,529
"And take the leap"

1529
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:47,567
Chicken's ready but
what will we eat it with?

1530
01:26:48,775 --> 01:26:49,862
We'll have to make flatbreads.

1531
01:26:49,942 --> 01:26:50,775
Right.

1532
01:26:50,942 --> 01:26:51,942
Who'll make the flatbreads?

1533
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:54,483
Who'll make flatbreads?

1534
01:26:59,692 --> 01:27:00,567
Harder.

1535
01:27:01,150 --> 01:27:02,692
Use your wrist, knead harder.

1536
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:04,900
It's very dry, add some water.

1537
01:27:04,983 --> 01:27:06,858
Sir, even mom hasn't
started teaching us this yet.

1538
01:27:06,942 --> 01:27:08,108
And she shouldn't also.

1539
01:27:08,358 --> 01:27:09,775
Sir, let them handle the dough kneading.

1540
01:27:09,858 --> 01:27:11,108
We'll do something else meanwhile.

1541
01:27:11,192 --> 01:27:12,025
Zip it.

1542
01:27:12,983 --> 01:27:14,608
Sir, this is what they'll
be doing in the future?

1543
01:27:16,233 --> 01:27:17,233
I hope that answers your question.

1544
01:27:17,733 --> 01:27:18,567
Carry on.

1545
01:27:20,192 --> 01:27:20,983
Very good.

1546
01:27:27,358 --> 01:27:28,400
Who all will have juice?

1547
01:27:30,525 --> 01:27:33,733
For guavas, he makes dogs run after us.

1548
01:27:34,108 --> 01:27:36,942
For chicken, he makes us catch them.

1549
01:27:37,483 --> 01:27:38,942
We aren't raising our hands only this time.

1550
01:27:39,192 --> 01:27:40,192
Drop it.

1551
01:28:03,067 --> 01:28:07,692
"The fear of the unknown is like quicksand"

1552
01:28:07,775 --> 01:28:14,962
"You just need to cross
it and make every move count"

1553
01:28:15,192 --> 01:28:19,733
"It's time to pierce
the darkness with your roar"

1554
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:21,108
"It's time to get ready"

1555
01:28:21,192 --> 01:28:22,483
- Fast, fast, fast, fast

1556
01:28:22,567 --> 01:28:26,945
"It's time to get ready"

1557
01:28:27,025 --> 01:28:33,586
"And take the leap"

1558
01:28:36,275 --> 01:28:42,971
"And take the leap"

1559
01:28:51,317 --> 01:28:52,150
Go for it, Pinky.

1560
01:28:55,275 --> 01:28:56,442
Go for it, Pinky.

1561
01:28:56,692 --> 01:28:58,817
Go, go, go.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

1562
01:29:00,108 --> 01:29:01,108
Take a Toe touch, toe touch!

1563
01:29:01,192 --> 01:29:02,692
- Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi.
- Toe touch, Toe touch.

1564
01:29:02,775 --> 01:29:05,233
Move forward, move forward.
Don't give up, Pinky. Go, go, go.

1565
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:06,733
Use your strength.

1566
01:29:07,025 --> 01:29:08,775
Use your strength.
Very good, very good.

1567
01:29:08,858 --> 01:29:09,733
Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi.

1568
01:29:09,817 --> 01:29:12,317
- Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi.
- Try, try, try. Go, go, go.

1569
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:13,233
Get off her!

1570
01:29:26,150 --> 01:29:28,567
Well done Sir. Being lenient towards
your own brother was one thing,

1571
01:29:28,942 --> 01:29:30,942
but you've crossed the line by giving
all the boys a license to touch.

1572
01:29:31,483 --> 01:29:34,192
They are playing all
day long instead of studying.

1573
01:29:35,108 --> 01:29:37,483
They are being made to play Kabaddi
during a Mathematics class.

1574
01:29:37,817 --> 01:29:42,150
My child had scored 80%
last term and just 75% this term.

1575
01:29:42,567 --> 01:29:44,692
When will our kids study
if they keep playing all day?

1576
01:29:44,942 --> 01:29:48,483
Moreover, they lie, get the
kids here and make them practice.

1577
01:29:48,567 --> 01:29:50,775
We would have understood if
they were playing Cricket,

1578
01:29:51,150 --> 01:29:53,608
But what will they gain by
playing Basketball and Kabaddi?

1579
01:29:54,025 --> 01:29:55,442
What are you saying?

1580
01:29:56,358 --> 01:29:57,983
Sport is an essential activity for kids.

1581
01:29:58,275 --> 01:29:59,733
We don't object to you teaching
sports during the assigned classes.

1582
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:01,525
Final exams are approaching,

1583
01:30:01,608 --> 01:30:03,275
and they are busy making them run around.

1584
01:30:03,358 --> 01:30:04,442
This is all rubbish.

1585
01:30:04,775 --> 01:30:05,733
We know everything.

1586
01:30:06,108 --> 01:30:09,150
You are ruining our children's
future in order to save your job.

1587
01:30:09,442 --> 01:30:11,775
We don't want them to
participate in any competition.

1588
01:30:11,858 --> 01:30:13,775
Yes, we don't want
them to participate in it.

1589
01:30:13,858 --> 01:30:17,025
But mom, let us participate
in the tournament at least.

1590
01:30:17,233 --> 01:30:18,525
Shut up and get back to your class.

1591
01:30:19,692 --> 01:30:23,400
If we find our children on the
ground again, we'll change their school.

1592
01:30:25,025 --> 01:30:26,275
You people don't get it.

1593
01:30:26,858 --> 01:30:28,025
It will all be over in just two days.

1594
01:30:28,108 --> 01:30:30,275
No, no more excuses.

1595
01:30:30,858 --> 01:30:33,442
Forget two days, we won't
allow this for another second.

1596
01:30:33,942 --> 01:30:35,150
Goodbye.
Let's go.

1597
01:30:35,525 --> 01:30:37,942
- Let's go, lad.
- Come on.

1598
01:30:38,025 --> 01:30:39,608
- Himanshu, hurry up.
- Come on.

1599
01:30:39,692 --> 01:30:41,483
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1600
01:30:42,275 --> 01:30:43,525
- Let's go home.
- He won't study.

1601
01:30:43,608 --> 01:30:45,733
- We've sent you here to study
- You need a good smacking.

1602
01:30:46,317 --> 01:30:47,525
Want to play, huh?

1603
01:30:52,608 --> 01:30:53,358
Usha?

1604
01:30:54,358 --> 01:30:56,567
Shukla Ji, I can give
permission for the competition,

1605
01:30:57,233 --> 01:31:00,817
but I cannot force the parents
into allowing their kids to participate.

1606
01:31:01,650 --> 01:31:02,525
If you can manage to get the kids back,

1607
01:31:02,817 --> 01:31:03,942
you can go ahead with the competition.

1608
01:31:20,150 --> 01:31:21,942
Students cannot learn
without practicing.

1609
01:31:24,746 --> 01:31:25,400
Dad?

1610
01:31:25,483 --> 01:31:27,608
Keep sitting.

1611
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:41,442
His grandfather was a famous lawyer.

1612
01:31:44,192 --> 01:31:49,108
I was petrified when
I started interning with him.

1613
01:31:53,108 --> 01:31:54,483
All kinds of people used to come there.

1614
01:31:56,108 --> 01:31:56,692
- No.
- What...

1615
01:31:56,775 --> 01:31:57,942
Don't hesitate.

1616
01:31:59,317 --> 01:32:00,108
Take it.

1617
01:32:02,817 --> 01:32:05,858
Some obviously looked guilty,

1618
01:32:07,233 --> 01:32:10,817
while some clearly looked innocent.

1619
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:13,733
Cheers.

1620
01:32:20,983 --> 01:32:23,567
One day a man with murder
charges on him came to us.

1621
01:32:25,025 --> 01:32:27,150
His grandfather asked,
"What do you think?"

1622
01:32:28,108 --> 01:32:30,317
I immediately replied, "He is guilty."

1623
01:32:31,108 --> 01:32:33,025
"Don't take his case. You will lose."

1624
01:32:33,858 --> 01:32:39,358
He asked all his assistants to leave
his cabin, and had a talk with me.

1625
01:32:40,817 --> 01:32:42,358
He said, "Son, we are lawyers."

1626
01:32:43,483 --> 01:32:48,233
"Our job is not to pass judgments,
but to fight for our clients."

1627
01:32:49,233 --> 01:32:52,692
"Right or wrong, every person
has a right to fight for themselves"

1628
01:32:53,525 --> 01:32:55,150
"and it is our job
to fight for them."

1629
01:32:56,983 --> 01:32:58,275
"You win some and you lose some."

1630
01:32:59,733 --> 01:33:01,650
"But never declare the judgment
before the case is over."

1631
01:33:02,942 --> 01:33:05,900
"Neither to your
client nor to yourself."

1632
01:33:09,942 --> 01:33:10,650
You know,...

1633
01:33:12,942 --> 01:33:13,942
he won the case.

1634
01:33:16,275 --> 01:33:19,775
No one believed that he would,
but he did.

1635
01:33:23,608 --> 01:33:25,108
That's the day I understood,

1636
01:33:27,775 --> 01:33:31,442
no matter how evident your defeat is,

1637
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:35,692
judgment takes place
only after the argument is over.

1638
01:33:38,983 --> 01:33:41,108
Son, people who win are often those

1639
01:33:43,317 --> 01:33:45,525
who keep deferring accepting defeat.

1640
01:33:47,817 --> 01:33:50,817
All it takes is one more witness,
one more question.

1641
01:33:52,108 --> 01:33:53,483
Just one more argument.

1642
01:34:02,442 --> 01:34:03,317
Don't quit.

1643
01:34:09,275 --> 01:34:10,358
No way.

1644
01:34:15,942 --> 01:34:17,692
But the kids will come only
if their parents allow them to.

1645
01:34:18,775 --> 01:34:20,442
Not just the kids,
their parents will also come.

1646
01:34:21,317 --> 01:34:22,858
We are from counter number five.

1647
01:34:23,442 --> 01:34:24,775
We deserve another argument.

1648
01:34:42,150 --> 01:34:43,108
Hello, Ma'am.

1649
01:34:43,483 --> 01:34:44,442
Hello, Ma'am.

1650
01:34:45,108 --> 01:34:46,108
Hello, Ma'am.

1651
01:34:47,275 --> 01:34:48,858
Mom, she teaches me Computers.

1652
01:34:49,025 --> 01:34:50,108
Hello.

1653
01:34:50,317 --> 01:34:51,317
Pinky, get some water.

1654
01:34:51,858 --> 01:34:53,150
Please have a seat.

1655
01:34:56,483 --> 01:34:58,150
He is Pinky's father.

1656
01:34:58,608 --> 01:34:59,317
Hello.

1657
01:34:59,650 --> 01:35:01,483
I hope everything is alright.

1658
01:35:02,942 --> 01:35:07,483
It's not, but it will be if you
send Pinky for tomorrow's competition.

1659
01:35:07,983 --> 01:35:09,192
Competition?

1660
01:35:11,650 --> 01:35:12,608
Please have some water.

1661
01:35:16,483 --> 01:35:17,692
No, thank you.

1662
01:35:20,239 --> 01:35:21,192
Are you done?

1663
01:35:29,525 --> 01:35:30,900
Conciliation,
Price, Punishment, Disjunction.

1664
01:35:31,483 --> 01:35:33,733
So, conciliation.
Sir, have you seen the film Dangal?

1665
01:35:34,525 --> 01:35:35,442
There were two fathers in it.

1666
01:35:35,983 --> 01:35:37,983
One who got his daughter
married at a young age,

1667
01:35:38,650 --> 01:35:40,525
and the other who made
his daughter so skilled,

1668
01:35:41,150 --> 01:35:42,358
that she won a medal for the country.

1669
01:35:44,733 --> 01:35:46,192
Which father's role had
Aamir Khan portrayed in it?

1670
01:35:46,608 --> 01:35:47,483
The second one.

1671
01:35:47,858 --> 01:35:49,775
Now you decide which
father do you wish to be.

1672
01:35:50,442 --> 01:35:51,608
- I...
- Price!

1673
01:35:52,192 --> 01:35:54,942
I need to name two students
for a Computers scholarship.

1674
01:35:55,736 --> 01:35:57,483
I can refer Pinky's name if you want.

1675
01:36:02,275 --> 01:36:03,150
Punishment!

1676
01:36:03,501 --> 01:36:06,858
Sir, Bijender,
the one who owns the shop next to yours,

1677
01:36:07,358 --> 01:36:14,233
claims that the land your shop is on
was sold by your father to his father.

1678
01:36:15,025 --> 01:36:19,150
He has found the transfer deed
in an old trunk kept in the attic.

1679
01:36:19,817 --> 01:36:20,858
He has sent this notice.

1680
01:36:21,317 --> 01:36:23,900
Ma'am, I tried my best
to convince him otherwise.

1681
01:36:24,233 --> 01:36:27,858
It is not right to make
a false case against a decent man.

1682
01:36:28,150 --> 01:36:29,650
But he paid no heed to it.

1683
01:36:30,025 --> 01:36:32,983
Now tell me,
do I try to convince him some more,

1684
01:36:34,733 --> 01:36:35,900
or do we meet in court?

1685
01:36:39,192 --> 01:36:40,150
Disjunction!

1686
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:43,900
Pinky, your father doesn't
want you to progress in life.

1687
01:36:44,817 --> 01:36:46,733
He's asked you to drop out from the competition
so that you can do household chores?

1688
01:36:49,108 --> 01:36:50,817
Oh no, Pinky. Don't cry.

1689
01:36:51,483 --> 01:36:55,108
I'd suggest once you get a little older,
just run away from home.

1690
01:37:09,775 --> 01:37:10,650
Now, I'm done!

1691
01:37:15,108 --> 01:37:16,150
Tomorrow morning at seven.

1692
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:17,942
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1693
01:37:34,275 --> 01:37:35,192
Get straight to punishment.

1694
01:37:35,983 --> 01:37:37,108
Let's give others a try at least.

1695
01:37:37,317 --> 01:37:38,275
It'll be a waste of time.

1696
01:37:38,858 --> 01:37:39,817
Look at his face.

1697
01:37:40,150 --> 01:37:41,025
Punishment.

1698
01:37:46,233 --> 01:37:46,983
Punishment.

1699
01:37:52,525 --> 01:37:55,233
Your son will fail no matter what.

1700
01:37:56,108 --> 01:37:58,650
I'll grade him an F even
if he gets his answers right.

1701
01:37:59,650 --> 01:38:01,150
His year will be wasted.
That's for sure.

1702
01:38:23,726 --> 01:38:24,900
Conciliation,
Price, Punishment, Disjunction.

1703
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:56,775
- Good morning, Sir.
- Good morning, Sir.

1704
01:38:57,192 --> 01:38:58,942
- Good morning, Sir.
- Good morning, Sir.

1705
01:38:59,022 --> 01:39:00,858
- Good morning, Sir.
- Good morning.

1706
01:39:01,817 --> 01:39:04,400
- Good morning, Sir.
- Good morning, Sir.

1707
01:39:06,567 --> 01:39:07,858
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1708
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:23,150
Let's go!

1709
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:29,442
We don't have to just defeat them,
we have to crush them so bad,

1710
01:39:29,525 --> 01:39:31,442
that they don't dare
to enter the field again.

1711
01:39:33,358 --> 01:39:34,608
No pep talk, Sir?

1712
01:39:35,567 --> 01:39:36,567
What's there to say?

1713
01:39:37,567 --> 01:39:38,650
My speech won't help.

1714
01:39:40,025 --> 01:39:41,108
You know how to play.

1715
01:39:41,483 --> 01:39:43,567
I'm confident you can do it.

1716
01:39:44,942 --> 01:39:45,858
Go and have fun.

1717
01:39:46,676 --> 01:39:48,317
- Ready?
- Yes, Sir.

1718
01:39:49,775 --> 01:39:52,150
I welcome you all from
the commentary box,

1719
01:39:52,858 --> 01:39:54,567
along with Principal Usha.

1720
01:39:54,858 --> 01:39:56,233
Yay!

1721
01:39:58,942 --> 01:40:00,400
Support our team with gusto.

1722
01:40:07,442 --> 01:40:08,650
Ma'am, you were saying,..

1723
01:40:08,733 --> 01:40:10,942
the parents won't send their kids?

1724
01:40:11,025 --> 01:40:15,858
I wasn't saying, I was hoping.
I can't watch Montu lose so badly.

1725
01:40:21,192 --> 01:40:23,233
The game has just begun.

1726
01:40:23,942 --> 01:40:25,525
Let them warm up a little.

1727
01:40:28,608 --> 01:40:29,275
There you go!

1728
01:40:30,775 --> 01:40:32,025
Scores are level.

1729
01:40:32,108 --> 01:40:33,025
3-2

1730
01:40:33,108 --> 01:40:33,525
Why?

1731
01:40:33,650 --> 01:40:35,275
Why did Bablu get three points,

1732
01:40:35,358 --> 01:40:37,900
- and Pinky got only two?
- Bablu, get out of the screen

1733
01:40:37,983 --> 01:40:39,567
This is unfair, Usha.

1734
01:40:39,733 --> 01:40:42,067
You get more points if you
score the basket from a distance.

1735
01:40:46,858 --> 01:40:48,108
Sit down, what are you doing?

1736
01:40:48,192 --> 01:40:50,650
- He's from Singh's team.
- But Bablu is our son.

1737
01:40:50,733 --> 01:40:52,400
Yeah, go for it Gaurav.

1738
01:40:52,483 --> 01:40:54,483
- Shoot from there itself.
- Pass the ball, Pass the ball.

1739
01:40:55,942 --> 01:40:58,150
Go, go, go, go!
Pass it to Pinky, pass it to Pinky

1740
01:40:58,233 --> 01:40:59,400
Cover him, cover him

1741
01:40:59,483 --> 01:41:01,692
- Pass it Pinky. She is open.
- You can do it, kiddo.

1742
01:41:01,983 --> 01:41:03,983
Go, go, go, Bablu. Come on!

1743
01:41:04,108 --> 01:41:05,400
Go, go, go.

1744
01:41:05,483 --> 01:41:06,192
Yes!

1745
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:12,858
Block him, block him.

1746
01:41:13,650 --> 01:41:15,150
- Block him
- Go, go, go.

1747
01:41:17,317 --> 01:41:18,858
They deserve five points for that!

1748
01:41:18,942 --> 01:41:20,692
The maximum they can score is three.

1749
01:41:20,775 --> 01:41:22,942
Block him, Block him. Block from behind

1750
01:41:27,733 --> 01:41:29,817
Singh Sir's team is in
the lead in the first quarter.

1751
01:41:31,692 --> 01:41:33,358
Go, go, go.

1752
01:41:34,733 --> 01:41:36,358
Very good, very good.

1753
01:41:52,775 --> 01:41:54,733
Singh Sir's lead is into double figures

1754
01:41:54,817 --> 01:41:57,108
Singh Sir - 21, Montu - 08

1755
01:41:59,775 --> 01:42:01,108
Don't attempt three pointers.

1756
01:42:02,358 --> 01:42:03,233
Come on Pinky!

1757
01:42:03,317 --> 01:42:03,775
Attack!

1758
01:42:03,858 --> 01:42:06,442
- Block her, block her
- You are doing great. Excellent!

1759
01:42:12,358 --> 01:42:13,317
Oh, sorry.

1760
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:15,067
- What are you doing?
- Well, I...

1761
01:42:18,317 --> 01:42:19,525
Why are you shooting
from such a distance?

1762
01:42:19,608 --> 01:42:20,692
Pass the ball.

1763
01:42:20,775 --> 01:42:22,150
Pass it ahead.

1764
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:26,317
Well done!

1765
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:27,817
Hurry up.

1766
01:42:30,608 --> 01:42:32,400
The way Montu's team,...

1767
01:42:32,525 --> 01:42:33,942
is making a comeback,...

1768
01:42:34,233 --> 01:42:35,775
it won't take them long,...

1769
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:37,150
to cover the lead.

1770
01:42:37,275 --> 01:42:38,400
Good, good, good. Well done.

1771
01:42:38,483 --> 01:42:39,567
Look at that.

1772
01:42:39,650 --> 01:42:41,025
Through such small legs,

1773
01:42:41,150 --> 01:42:42,775
he managed to pass a Basketball.

1774
01:42:42,858 --> 01:42:43,942
Come on, come on, come on.

1775
01:42:44,692 --> 01:42:46,692
Tighten the defence.
Defend harder

1776
01:42:57,317 --> 01:42:58,650
Well done! Well done!

1777
01:43:00,233 --> 01:43:01,108
Pinky!

1778
01:43:02,983 --> 01:43:04,358
Referee, time out! Time out!

1779
01:43:06,983 --> 01:43:07,733
What happened?

1780
01:43:08,150 --> 01:43:09,275
Why did they stop the game?

1781
01:43:10,858 --> 01:43:11,567
What happened?

1782
01:43:12,108 --> 01:43:13,108
You guys can't play anymore?

1783
01:43:13,317 --> 01:43:14,192
You guys are doing well.

1784
01:43:14,275 --> 01:43:15,525
You just need to pay
attention on your defence.

1785
01:43:15,733 --> 01:43:16,942
Play your game, stay focused.

1786
01:43:17,358 --> 01:43:19,442
The ball always travels
faster than the player.

1787
01:43:19,775 --> 01:43:20,567
Got it?

1788
01:43:23,733 --> 01:43:25,192
Don't worry. Very good, very good.

1789
01:43:25,275 --> 01:43:26,400
Take your time.

1790
01:43:36,233 --> 01:43:38,483
Both teams are competing fiercely.

1791
01:43:41,692 --> 01:43:43,317
Excellent. Keep at it.

1792
01:43:48,275 --> 01:43:50,358
Pinky can easily score four points.

1793
01:43:54,608 --> 01:43:56,025
- Pinky
- Pinky

1794
01:43:56,401 --> 01:43:57,317
Pinky?

1795
01:43:59,983 --> 01:44:01,317
What happened?

1796
01:44:01,983 --> 01:44:02,442
Are you okay?

1797
01:44:02,525 --> 01:44:03,942
What happened? Pinky?

1798
01:44:04,233 --> 01:44:04,900
Easy, easy.

1799
01:44:05,150 --> 01:44:06,317
Don't worry! It's okay.

1800
01:44:06,567 --> 01:44:08,692
Now, we're doomed.

1801
01:44:21,025 --> 01:44:22,150
Take it, take it.

1802
01:44:22,275 --> 01:44:23,817
Lokesh is free
Pass it to Lokesh.

1803
01:44:24,317 --> 01:44:25,942
Last five minutes of the last quarter.

1804
01:44:26,192 --> 01:44:27,192
Tables can turn any moment now.

1805
01:44:36,442 --> 01:44:37,400
Block him.

1806
01:44:55,942 --> 01:44:58,150
Faster, faster.
Go, go, go.

1807
01:45:04,817 --> 01:45:05,775
Just two minutes are left.

1808
01:45:05,983 --> 01:45:07,858
Pinky's absence is being felt.

1809
01:45:50,059 --> 01:45:51,192
We won!

1810
01:46:05,275 --> 01:46:06,942
Well done.
Well played, Lokesh.

1811
01:46:07,025 --> 01:46:07,983
No!

1812
01:46:09,275 --> 01:46:10,942
Hey! No, don't cry.

1813
01:46:11,025 --> 01:46:12,275
Hang on a second.

1814
01:46:13,317 --> 01:46:14,608
Why are you rejoicing?

1815
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:19,150
A team that should've lost
by 80 points, lost by just 8 points.

1816
01:46:22,233 --> 01:46:23,233
We have two matches to go.

1817
01:46:24,025 --> 01:46:24,858
Give it your best.

1818
01:46:24,942 --> 01:46:26,108
You played so well.

1819
01:46:27,983 --> 01:46:31,275
Why are you so happy on our defeat, Sir?

1820
01:46:33,942 --> 01:46:37,317
A team that should've won
by 80 points won by just 8 points.

1821
01:46:38,567 --> 01:46:39,775
Who made that possible?

1822
01:46:43,317 --> 01:46:44,733
Well done.
Well played.

1823
01:46:44,817 --> 01:46:46,817
You all played so well.
Well played.

1824
01:46:50,442 --> 01:46:51,525
Lokesh, first.

1825
01:46:51,983 --> 01:46:52,858
Followed by Ratan.

1826
01:46:53,025 --> 01:46:54,900
Nidhi and then Specky.

1827
01:46:56,233 --> 01:46:57,400
What are you doing?

1828
01:46:57,983 --> 01:46:59,442
Make Amrish run first.

1829
01:46:59,983 --> 01:47:01,317
Will he be able to handle
the pressure in the end?

1830
01:47:01,442 --> 01:47:02,733
Sir, I'll go last then?

1831
01:47:02,983 --> 01:47:04,275
No, you go first.

1832
01:47:09,067 --> 01:47:10,817
Come on, come on, come on.

1833
01:47:10,900 --> 01:47:13,108
The second phase of
the competition has begun.

1834
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:15,192
4x400m Relay Race.

1835
01:47:15,275 --> 01:47:16,483
Also known as pass-the-baton race.

1836
01:47:16,733 --> 01:47:18,900
Please make way for the family.

1837
01:47:19,025 --> 01:47:20,820
No, no Sir don't worry.

1838
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:22,400
That happened in the spur of the moment.

1839
01:47:22,650 --> 01:47:23,317
I apologize for that.

1840
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:27,775
From Singh Sir's team we have Shoaib,
Shivam, Ravi and Vipin.

1841
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:32,317
And from Team Montu we have Lokesh,
Ratan, Nidhi and Vivek.

1842
01:47:32,525 --> 01:47:33,692
Stay focused.

1843
01:47:33,775 --> 01:47:34,942
Others clear the track. Come on

1844
01:47:39,233 --> 01:47:41,317
Shoaib, stay focused, okay?

1845
01:47:41,442 --> 01:47:42,400
You have had the necessary training.

1846
01:47:42,483 --> 01:47:43,567
Now it's just the track and you.

1847
01:47:43,650 --> 01:47:44,733
Don't think about anything else.

1848
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:47,525
I want a lead in the first round, okay?

1849
01:47:53,442 --> 01:47:55,708
Lokesh, stay calm.

1850
01:47:56,442 --> 01:47:57,885
Make sure the first pick up is strong.

1851
01:47:58,141 --> 01:47:58,934
Come on!

1852
01:48:07,733 --> 01:48:09,192
Run Lokesh! Lokesh run!

1853
01:48:09,275 --> 01:48:11,025
- Go, go, go!
- Fast, fast, fast!

1854
01:48:14,900 --> 01:48:16,650
Lokesh, maintain the lead.

1855
01:48:17,567 --> 01:48:19,400
- Take the lead! Take the lead!
- Come on Lokesh, come on.

1856
01:48:19,525 --> 01:48:21,983
Team Montu's Lokesh
has taken the initial lead.

1857
01:48:22,442 --> 01:48:25,442
His start was great, but I know Shoaib.
He will soon shift gears.

1858
01:48:32,895 --> 01:48:33,900
What do we have here?

1859
01:48:33,983 --> 01:48:37,483
Shoaib, from Singh Sir's
team has taken the lead now.

1860
01:48:37,567 --> 01:48:39,070
Go, go, go!
Good, good, good!

1861
01:48:39,150 --> 01:48:40,983
Change your position!
Change your position!

1862
01:48:41,067 --> 01:48:41,900
Don't worry Lokesh. Come on!

1863
01:48:41,980 --> 01:48:43,025
Lokesh, run!

1864
01:48:44,442 --> 01:48:47,987
And we have in our Commentary Box,
Ms. Usha.

1865
01:48:48,067 --> 01:48:49,733
Catch up, catch up, run faster.

1866
01:48:49,858 --> 01:48:50,567
Very good.

1867
01:48:54,983 --> 01:48:57,067
Don't leave him, Ratan.
Keep running! Keep running!

1868
01:49:13,067 --> 01:49:14,067
Nidhi run fast.

1869
01:49:14,275 --> 01:49:15,317
Cover up! cover up!

1870
01:49:15,692 --> 01:49:16,942
Come on, Nidhi.

1871
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:24,233
Yes sir, bring them.

1872
01:49:24,567 --> 01:49:26,108
Fast, fast, fast. It's ready.

1873
01:49:35,135 --> 01:49:37,803
Go, go, go!
Maintain the lead we have.

1874
01:49:39,858 --> 01:49:41,483
- Fast, fast.
- Take the baton! Take the baton!

1875
01:49:41,567 --> 01:49:42,858
Go, go, go!

1876
01:49:43,442 --> 01:49:44,817
Take a good pick-up.

1877
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:46,442
Cover the distance

1878
01:49:54,192 --> 01:49:56,407
He's almost there.
The match is ours.

1879
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:02,650
Watch this.

1880
01:50:50,192 --> 01:50:53,150
The dogs helped us win!

1881
01:50:53,275 --> 01:50:56,820
Thank God! Had it not been for these dogs,
we would have gone to the dogs today.

1882
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:57,858
Madam!

1883
01:50:58,025 --> 01:51:00,608
- Brother!
- Congratulations

1884
01:51:49,733 --> 01:51:51,233
Both captains, come in.

1885
01:51:56,608 --> 01:51:57,525
Heads.

1886
01:51:59,817 --> 01:52:00,400
Heads?

1887
01:52:01,942 --> 01:52:02,275
Raid.

1888
01:52:02,358 --> 01:52:04,608
Ankit. Attacking, attacking. Very good!

1889
01:52:04,942 --> 01:52:07,150
- Go for it.
- Good, good, good.

1890
01:52:10,442 --> 01:52:11,692
Go for it.

1891
01:52:15,442 --> 01:52:16,442
Come on Bablu!

1892
01:52:22,442 --> 01:52:24,025
He'll go for a toe touch.

1893
01:52:24,108 --> 01:52:25,108
He'll go for a toe touch!

1894
01:52:25,233 --> 01:52:26,900
Keep moving,
keep moving, you'll get an opportunity.

1895
01:52:26,983 --> 01:52:28,733
Keep distance, keep distance.

1896
01:52:29,233 --> 01:52:30,317
Reeti, keep distance.

1897
01:52:38,317 --> 01:52:39,483
You'll get him

1898
01:52:39,567 --> 01:52:40,983
It's okay, Saksham. Go, go, go.

1899
01:52:41,108 --> 01:52:43,733
You can grab him.
You can easily grab him.

1900
01:52:44,442 --> 01:52:46,525
Yeah, get him.
Well done

1901
01:52:48,025 --> 01:52:51,150
Red out. One point, Singh Team.

1902
01:52:51,275 --> 01:52:53,483
Try to score two points.

1903
01:52:57,275 --> 01:52:58,442
What are you guys doing?

1904
01:52:59,108 --> 01:53:01,483
Singh Team, two points.

1905
01:53:04,442 --> 01:53:06,733
Take your time Reeti. Take your time.

Well done, girl. Well done.

01:53:14,483 --> 01:53:16,483
Score at least two points.

1910
01:53:18,858 --> 01:53:19,567
Well done.

1911
01:53:22,483 --> 01:53:25,067
Don't be hasty.
Don't be hasty. Don't be hasty.

1912
01:53:26,608 --> 01:53:28,525
You got it. Well done.

1913
01:53:28,900 --> 01:53:31,067
- Amazing. Well done!
- Well done Montu.

1914
01:53:34,650 --> 01:53:35,733
What are you doing?

1915
01:53:35,817 --> 01:53:37,775
Two points, Singh Team.

1916
01:53:46,192 --> 01:53:47,275
Go, go, go.

1917
01:53:48,692 --> 01:53:50,275
Go, go, go Bablu. You have to score.

1918
01:53:51,275 --> 01:53:52,067
Come on Bablu!

1919
01:53:54,692 --> 01:53:56,108
He'll take a toe touch again.

1920
01:53:56,525 --> 01:53:58,650
Watch it, watch it, watch it.
Be careful.

1921
01:54:01,900 --> 01:54:03,358
Catch him, catch him!

1922
01:54:04,442 --> 01:54:06,400
Montu Team, all out.

1923
01:54:06,567 --> 01:54:08,942
- Singh Team, five points.
- Don't worry. It's just half-time

1924
01:54:09,192 --> 01:54:10,275
Half time.

1925
01:54:14,858 --> 01:54:15,900
It's going great.

1926
01:54:15,983 --> 01:54:17,067
We can do better.

1927
01:54:18,775 --> 01:54:19,233
Reeti.

1928
01:54:20,150 --> 01:54:21,400
Keep your grip strong.

1929
01:54:21,858 --> 01:54:23,983
No one should be able
to wriggle out of it.

1930
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:26,358
Hemanshi,
you should surround them immediately.

1931
01:54:26,442 --> 01:54:27,442
Why do you wait for so long?

1932
01:54:27,817 --> 01:54:29,900
We aren't that far behind.
We can cover up I n the second half.

1933
01:54:30,275 --> 01:54:31,233
You guys are playing well.

1934
01:54:31,758 --> 01:54:32,862
Just stay strong.

1935
01:54:32,942 --> 01:54:35,400
Okay?
Good, good, good.

1936
01:54:36,858 --> 01:54:38,025
Let's go.

1937
01:54:43,525 --> 01:54:46,900
Watch out after half time.
The real game will begin.

1938
01:54:49,275 --> 01:54:51,400
Watch it, watch it, watch it.
Take your time.

1939
01:54:51,525 --> 01:54:52,067
Stay back.

1940
01:54:55,650 --> 01:54:56,983
Take your time. Take your time.

1941
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:01,067
Get him, get him. Very good, very good.
Three points.

1942
01:55:01,317 --> 01:55:03,150
Three points, Montu Team.

1943
01:55:03,233 --> 01:55:04,150
Very Good.

1944
01:55:16,692 --> 01:55:17,525
Well done!

1945
01:55:28,233 --> 01:55:29,233
Well done!

1946
01:55:44,727 --> 01:55:47,108
You'll get a chance. Watch it,
take your time, take your time.

1947
01:55:47,608 --> 01:55:48,858
Go, go, go.

1948
01:55:51,942 --> 01:55:52,858
Red out.

1949
01:55:52,942 --> 01:55:54,442
One point, Singh Team.

1950
01:55:56,859 --> 01:55:58,025
- Come on, come on.
- What happened?

1951
01:55:58,108 --> 01:55:58,733
Amit?

1952
01:56:01,650 --> 01:56:02,942
Is he badly injured?

1953
01:56:04,233 --> 01:56:05,733
Official time out.

1954
01:56:06,150 --> 01:56:07,429
Sit down.

1955
01:56:08,650 --> 01:56:09,942
He landed really badly on his back.

1956
01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:11,900
- Have some water.
- Take.

1957
01:56:16,940 --> 01:56:19,067
Now who'll replace such a good player?

1958
01:56:23,442 --> 01:56:24,650
Pinky, come on.

1959
01:56:26,817 --> 01:56:29,197
Pinky! How will she play. She's..

1960
01:56:29,467 --> 01:56:31,317
But Pinky is already injured.

1961
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:43,639
Well done, Pinky!

1962
01:56:43,775 --> 01:56:45,150
Very good, Pinky!

1963
01:56:46,005 --> 01:56:48,275
Keep it up keep it up.
We'll get this.

1964
01:56:49,775 --> 01:56:50,608
Keep at it.

1965
01:56:50,692 --> 01:56:51,692
Very Good!

1966
01:56:53,254 --> 01:56:54,025
Well done.

1967
01:56:54,108 --> 01:56:55,192
Very well done.

1968
01:56:55,275 --> 01:56:56,858
Well done, Vicky. Very good.

1969
01:57:03,733 --> 01:57:05,233
Well played!

1970
01:57:10,496 --> 01:57:12,263
Well done!

1971
01:57:15,152 --> 01:57:17,720
Take him, take him, take him.
Well done Pinky.

1972
01:57:20,942 --> 01:57:22,443
Move, move, move.

1973
01:57:23,608 --> 01:57:25,733
I'd told you, after half time.

1974
01:57:40,108 --> 01:57:41,275
One Point.

1975
01:57:41,733 --> 01:57:43,689
Come on Reeti! Very good, very good!

1976
01:57:47,817 --> 01:57:51,103
He'll come, he'll come.
He'll come inside.

1977
01:57:54,849 --> 01:57:56,448
Take him, take him, take him.

1978
01:58:23,522 --> 01:58:24,400
Sir?

1979
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:26,572
Do you still want to play
on as a formality or do we end this?

1980
01:58:37,025 --> 01:58:38,358
The game isn't over yet, Sir.

1981
01:58:40,874 --> 01:58:42,025
Come on Pinky!

1982
01:58:48,108 --> 01:58:55,775
"You can own the ground,"

1983
01:58:58,025 --> 01:59:04,233
"you just need to
rightfully demand"

1984
01:59:29,192 --> 01:59:32,733
- Well done, grab her!
- Go, Pinky! Go, Pinky! Go Pinky!

1985
01:59:34,775 --> 01:59:36,832
Pinky, put your hand on the line

1986
01:59:37,483 --> 01:59:39,067
Grab her and pull her back!

1987
01:59:39,150 --> 01:59:40,400
Pinky don't give up.
Put your hand on the line.

1988
01:59:40,483 --> 01:59:41,192
Catch hold of her hand.

1989
01:59:41,275 --> 01:59:42,733
Put your hand on the line.

1990
01:59:46,481 --> 01:59:47,900
Pull her hand back.

1991
01:59:48,192 --> 01:59:49,650
Come on!

1992
01:59:52,692 --> 01:59:54,528
Pull her back.

1993
01:59:54,608 --> 01:59:58,275
Pinky, come on.

1994
02:00:23,045 --> 02:00:24,656
Pinky!

1995
02:00:49,650 --> 02:00:52,817
Both the teams fought bravely,

1996
02:00:53,192 --> 02:00:55,233
but like it always
happens in any sport,

1997
02:00:55,692 --> 02:00:58,775
one team wins and the other loses.

1998
02:00:59,192 --> 02:01:02,820
I'd like to invite the losing coach,
Singh Sir,

1999
02:01:02,900 --> 02:01:05,442
so that he can share
a few words with us.

2000
02:01:05,525 --> 02:01:06,775
Singh Sir, please.

2001
02:01:14,233 --> 02:01:15,483
Thank you, Shukla Ji.

2002
02:01:17,525 --> 02:01:19,275
It really adds salt to
the wounds when you're already...

2003
02:01:19,983 --> 02:01:22,192
...seething from the loss
and have to say a few words.

2004
02:01:24,650 --> 02:01:26,692
When this competition began, I thought,

2005
02:01:26,817 --> 02:01:30,817
it's a competition between
the strongest team and the weakest team.

2006
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:35,942
But in the past two days,
I saw two teams compete at par.

2007
02:01:37,692 --> 02:01:41,525
And it's not an easy task
to get a weak team up to par.

2008
02:01:43,733 --> 02:01:45,400
No one better than
me can understand that,

2009
02:01:45,483 --> 02:01:49,025
because I only managed
to get a strong team at par.

2010
02:01:52,067 --> 02:01:54,817
Mahinder Sir, congratulations.

2011
02:01:56,567 --> 02:02:00,775
It feels really bad to say it,
but you...

2012
02:02:01,483 --> 02:02:02,733
you deserve this victory.

2013
02:02:06,442 --> 02:02:08,483
Please come and share
a few words with everyone.

2014
02:02:22,608 --> 02:02:24,858
I don't know what to say.

2015
02:02:27,483 --> 02:02:29,567
These kids helped
me keep my respect intact.

2016
02:02:32,192 --> 02:02:34,650
I'd like to thank a couple of people.

2017
02:02:35,358 --> 02:02:38,525
First of all, Usha Madam,
for giving me this opportunity.

2018
02:02:39,192 --> 02:02:41,692
Shukla Ji, for giving me the courage.

2019
02:02:43,067 --> 02:02:44,858
And Dad,

2020
02:02:46,150 --> 02:02:47,775
who stopped me from giving up.

2021
02:02:49,567 --> 02:02:50,733
Thank you.

2022
02:02:54,192 --> 02:02:55,400
Neelu,

2023
02:02:56,067 --> 02:02:57,567
Ms. Neelima Madam,

2024
02:03:01,623 --> 02:03:03,525
thank you for everything.

2025
02:03:06,607 --> 02:03:09,817
My students,
who endured all the torture,

2026
02:03:10,067 --> 02:03:12,150
and committed themselves
completely to this.

2027
02:03:13,567 --> 02:03:15,025
A huge round of applause for them.

2028
02:03:16,150 --> 02:03:18,400
A big hand for the players
from both the teams.

2029
02:03:21,733 --> 02:03:24,692
And the person I want
to thank the most is Singh Sir.

2030
02:03:27,858 --> 02:03:29,400
Don't take it as a taunt, Sir.

2031
02:03:29,900 --> 02:03:30,983
I mean it.

2032
02:03:32,483 --> 02:03:34,233
If you hadn't showed up,

2033
02:03:35,317 --> 02:03:38,692
I would've never realized that I'm
ruining the lives of these kids and mine as well.

2034
02:03:40,942 --> 02:03:42,608
Whatever the reason,

2035
02:03:43,900 --> 02:03:46,942
it's because of you that
I understood what it means to be a PTI.

2036
02:03:47,942 --> 02:03:49,457
I understood my responsibility.

2037
02:03:52,150 --> 02:03:53,942
I can never thank you enough, Sir.

2038
02:03:57,900 --> 02:03:59,400
I still have some things to say.

2039
02:04:03,442 --> 02:04:05,483
No matter who won today,

2040
02:04:06,608 --> 02:04:10,936
we both know that you
are a better coach than me, Sir.

2041
02:04:14,942 --> 02:04:18,585
So if you don't mind,
can we work together?

2042
02:04:20,347 --> 02:04:22,233
I still have a lot to learn from you.

2043
02:04:27,317 --> 02:04:28,525
Thank you, Sir.

2044
02:04:33,817 --> 02:04:35,108
Oh, give me a second.

2045
02:04:35,192 --> 02:04:37,526
Give me a second, please.
I forgot to mention something.

2046
02:04:39,608 --> 02:04:41,817
I would also like to thank
the parents of these students,

2047
02:04:42,317 --> 02:04:46,400
for supporting and
encouraging them by coming out here.

2048
02:04:47,233 --> 02:04:48,317
Thank you.

2049
02:04:53,567 --> 02:04:58,650
In our country, people want
their sons to be like Sachin Tendulkar,

2050
02:04:59,275 --> 02:05:01,025
and their daughters
to be like Saina Nehwal.

2051
02:05:01,858 --> 02:05:04,192
But no one wants to be
Sachin and Saina's parents.

2052
02:05:08,942 --> 02:05:12,025
To be Sachin Tendulkar,
Saina Nehwal, Virat Kohli,

2053
02:05:12,150 --> 02:05:14,608
Sania Mirza, P.V. Sindhu, Deepa Karmakar,

2054
02:05:14,733 --> 02:05:17,733
Vishwanathan Anand,
Abhinav Bindra, Dhanraj Pillay,

2055
02:05:17,858 --> 02:05:20,858
Gopichand,
Dhyan Chand, Sakshi Malik, Geeta Phogat,

2056
02:05:20,942 --> 02:05:24,233
P. T. Usha,
Mary Kom, Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev,

2057
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:28,150
Mithali Raj, Baichung Bhutia,
Sunil Chhetri, Mahendra Singh Dhoni,

2058
02:05:28,233 --> 02:05:33,317
their parents, their coaches
and their PTIs' support is required.

2059
02:05:34,900 --> 02:05:36,442
You cannot become one without them.

2060
02:05:41,650 --> 02:05:43,400
Our kids will also
become great sportspersons.

2061
02:05:45,942 --> 02:05:47,983
But before that,
we would have to become their support.

2062
02:05:58,733 --> 02:06:01,358
Sorry. Sorry, this sounded
like a boring speech, right?

2063
02:06:01,442 --> 02:06:02,400
No.

2064
02:06:02,483 --> 02:06:03,650
Thank you, thank you.

2065
02:06:07,692 --> 02:06:08,733
Montu Sir.

2066
02:06:11,775 --> 02:06:13,650
Sir, I'd say quit being a PTI
and contest in the elections instead.

2067
02:06:13,733 --> 02:06:15,525
Singh Sir is absolutely right.

2068
02:06:15,608 --> 02:06:18,275
Contest in the elections
and become the Sports Minister.

2069
02:06:19,067 --> 02:06:19,942
Shukla Ji.

2070
02:06:20,025 --> 02:06:21,608
Sir, you have made us toil so hard.

2071
02:06:21,692 --> 02:06:22,858
We deserve a party at least.

2072
02:06:23,233 --> 02:06:24,692
Yes, you'll get a party,

2073
02:06:25,608 --> 02:06:27,275
I just have to win one more match.

2074
02:07:06,233 --> 02:07:08,858
"You don't care about me"

2075
02:07:09,025 --> 02:07:11,650
"You don't spare any time for me"

2076
02:07:11,858 --> 02:07:14,442
"You don't care about me"

2077
02:07:14,567 --> 02:07:17,067
"You don't spare any time for me"

2078
02:07:17,233 --> 02:07:19,858
"I'm the one who always chases you"

2079
02:07:19,942 --> 02:07:22,733
"I'm the one who keeps on calling you"

2080
02:07:22,858 --> 02:07:25,483
"I'm the one who always chases you"

2081
02:07:25,608 --> 02:07:28,275
"I'm the one who keeps on calling you"

2082
02:07:28,483 --> 02:07:31,025
"You're never considerate towards me"

2083
02:07:31,317 --> 02:07:33,900
"You don't care about me"

2084
02:07:34,150 --> 02:07:36,608
"You don't spare any time for me"

2085
02:07:36,900 --> 02:07:39,650
"You don't care about me"

2086
02:07:51,650 --> 02:07:56,733
"I listen to everything you say
and you keep ignoring me"

2087
02:07:57,108 --> 02:07:59,817
"Tell me the truth,
do you even love me?"

2088
02:07:59,983 --> 02:08:02,233
"Or do you have someone
else in your life?"

2089
02:08:02,317 --> 02:08:04,525
"How do you manage without me?"

2090
02:08:04,733 --> 02:08:07,400
"What's going on in your heart,
tell me?"

2091
02:08:07,525 --> 02:08:10,025
"How do you manage without me?"

2092
02:08:10,275 --> 02:08:12,942
"What's going on in your heart,
tell me?"

2093
02:08:13,067 --> 02:08:15,692
"You don't share anything with me"

2094
02:08:15,942 --> 02:08:18,483
"You don't care about me"

2095
02:08:18,858 --> 02:08:21,233
"You don't spare any time for me"

2096
02:08:21,567 --> 02:08:24,358
"You don't care about me"

2097
02:08:24,775 --> 02:08:27,900
"I swear, there's no
girl at whom I stare"

2098
02:08:27,983 --> 02:08:30,608
"I've never met a girl
with whom you I can compare"

2099
02:08:30,733 --> 02:08:33,358
"When you sit down to eat,
I pull back your chair"

2100
02:08:33,483 --> 02:08:36,108
"How much more do
you expect me to care?"

2101
02:08:36,275 --> 02:08:38,692
"I do as you say,
I pick fights with everyone for you"

2102
02:08:38,817 --> 02:08:40,233
"Tell me, what else should I do?"

2103
02:08:40,358 --> 02:08:41,650
"For what am I being punished by you?"

2104
02:08:41,775 --> 02:08:44,483
"Have I ever asked how many
boys do you have on your snapchat?"

2105
02:08:44,608 --> 02:08:47,150
"Have I ever asked what
you do all day in your flat?"

2106
02:08:47,275 --> 02:08:50,108
"Have I ever checked
what's on your mobile?"

2107
02:08:50,275 --> 02:08:52,900
"Who all are listed
in your last dialled?"

2108
02:08:52,983 --> 02:08:55,692
"There is such a contrast
in your talking style"

2109
02:08:55,817 --> 02:08:58,442
"What all is hidden in this sarcastic smile?"

2110
02:08:58,567 --> 02:09:01,233
"There is such a contrast
in your talking style"

2111
02:09:01,317 --> 02:09:04,025
"What all is hidden in this sarcastic smile?"

2112

"I miss you and whatsapp you"

2115
02:09:12,525 --> 02:09:14,817
"But they remain unseen by you"

2116
02:09:14,900 --> 02:09:17,650
"You always seem to be busy
with someone or the other,"

2117
02:09:17,775 --> 02:09:19,983
"That's just mean of you!"

2118
02:09:20,108 --> 02:09:22,692
"Why don't you profess your love for me?"

2119
02:09:22,817 --> 02:09:25,525
"Why don't you hold my
hand where all can see?"

2120
02:09:25,608 --> 02:09:28,233
" Why don't you profess your love for me?"

2121
02:09:28,358 --> 02:09:31,067
"Why don't you hold my
hand where all can see?"

2122
02:09:31,233 --> 02:09:33,900
"You aren't at all
daring when it comes to me"

2123
02:09:34,108 --> 02:09:36,817
"You don't care about me"

2124
02:09:36,900 --> 02:09:39,442

"You don't care about me"

2127
02:09:45,275 --> 02:09:47,817
"You don't spare any time for me"
