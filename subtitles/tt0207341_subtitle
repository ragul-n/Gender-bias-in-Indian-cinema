When the person in the picture is so

But there's magic
in your hands'

It's Prem on the line'

25
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,232
You still haven't come?
- I have an urgent meeting'

26
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:16,820
What are you saying! The children

It's a very important meeting'

No, it's okay' I'll explain

00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,014
Mother, how naive she is!

32

What about your meeting?
- Which meeting?

33
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,978
Is a meeting more important
than my children?

34
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,605
This means,
you've suffered a loss?

35
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,650
Of course not! Your happiness
is worth Rs'50 million'

If such a girl can be found, won't a
man marry her and keep her at home?

49
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,076
Why would he
want her to model?!

50

Sorry, sir' Why would
he want her to model?

Of course, he does'

Meaning, my car has broken down
right in front of your house'

116
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,623
This implies even my car wants
us to get close to each other'

117
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,167
Really?

118
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,587

Yes' She has maintained
herself very well'

You always travel alone'
Take your wife also sometimes'

128
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:47,023
The poor girl is busy doing
household chores all day!

179
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,424
Madam, you will
have to be checked'

180
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:06,222
Why?! Do we look like terrorists
who have hidden a bomb?!

181

What's the matter, Lovely?
- She is checking me!

182

You let go of terrorists, and
that's when planes get detonated!

Don't you read the newspapers?

So that nobody
can see you with him'

192
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:46,262
Why fear when you're in love?
Why hide your face?

193
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:48,973
You don't know my mother,
she's very orthodox'

What's Pooja going to do there?

218
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:30,617
You're very naive! You just
don't know the meaning of romance!

219
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:33,036
Let's go and drink coffee'

220

My dear baby! l was so stupid

Daddy, how does

239
00:33:56,786 --> 00:33:58,538
On petrol'

240
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:03,335
Even your car runs on petrol'
Why doesn't your car fly then?

241
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:08,131
l'm sorry, son, l can't even
ask you to go and play outside'

242

Why not?

243
00:34:10,258 --> 00:34:13,345
Just shut up!

They show you how a plane flies!

248

Excuse me, madam, would you please

She was!

Because he is sitting on mine'

256

My friend will be coming there,

264
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:30,296
l was once going
to Ludhiana by bus'

265
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:32,590
A fantastic looking babe like her
was sitting next to me'

266
00:35:33,258 --> 00:35:36,469
A friend asked her to get up' l
wanted to throw him out of the bus!

267
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:38,847
My sentiments exactly!
- What did you say?

268
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:44,602
My ears get blocked in a plane'
l feel sleepy, so let me sleep'

269

Go to sleep,
even l'll sleep here'

00:35:48,273 --> 00:35:49,774
Go and sleep on your seat!

271

lt's not nice disturbing her
every now and then'

272
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:55,113
What does she mean to you?
- Nothing, but it does not look good!

273
00:35:57,449 --> 00:35:59,325
You also go to sleep'

274
00:36:04,956 --> 00:36:08,043
Hey! Where is Pillu?
- Where is Pillu?

275

Where's he?
- He was with you, wasn't he?

276
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:16,801
Hey! Will you just be
hooked on to the camera?

277
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:19,304
Are you a doctor's son
or a cameraman's?!

278
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:21,931
Lovely, stay here, while l
go and fetch the room keys'

279
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:23,975
You just don't stay with us!

280
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:40,158
Prem, you here, in this hotel?!

281
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,580
You said you'd stay at your friend's
place, so what are you doing here?

282
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:48,500
Friends can be real bad, right?
- What are you saying!

283
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:52,879
He did not come to receive me at
the airport, so l had to come here'

284
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:57,050
By the way, it's a coincidence that
we are staying in the same hotel'

285
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,845
lt's not a coincidence,
it's my friendship, my love'

286

l had exchanged my seat
with you in the plane'

295
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:36,006
What a bore he is!

Remember!
- Oh! Him?!

297
00:37:44,097 --> 00:37:47,100
lf the Lord destines you to
befriend someone, then it is imminent!

Are you staying in
this hotel? ln which room?

Why didn't you
get her remarried?

331
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:42,632
Because of mother'
She is very orthodox'

332

Daddy! why did you switch off the TV?
- So that you go off to sleep!

Really?
- Yes!

350

He had no job, no business'
He used to live in a rented house'

Do you have a mother?

Then what do you know about the
love shared by a mother and her son?

431
00:52:17,804 --> 00:52:21,307
My mother said,
''Son, she is a mad girl'''

432
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:24,644
''Marry Pooja, she'll become fine
once she gets married'''

433

l married her' But she
did not become all right'

434
00:52:28,815 --> 00:52:33,319
Then my mother asked me to father a
son, so that she'd become all right'

You are married,

Henceforth, we have
nothing to do with each other!

442
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:00,930
So what if l'm married?
Does that make me an untouchable?!

443
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:04,059
Can't a normal girl
enter my life?

444
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:08,730
You ask me to leave you, but
how can l? l love you very much!

That mad woman must
have come to receive me'

Don't even talk to me before her
or she'll bring the roof down'

placed my bag in her trolley'

How's the food?
- Wow! lt's superb!

496
00:57:09,846 --> 00:57:11,806
By the way, how does Pooja cook?

497
00:57:12,891 --> 00:57:14,392
Whose name have you taken!
- Why?

498
00:57:14,642 --> 00:57:17,896
You've spoilt the fun!
- Doesn't she cook well?

499
00:57:19,147 --> 00:57:21,191
Pooja will cook well,
provided she ever cooks!

500
00:57:21,649 --> 00:57:25,362
As of now, she can only talk big!
- I see please eat

Come here'

Now what?
- My back!

507
00:57:46,883 --> 00:57:49,344
Again?!
- lt's not sprained!

508
00:58:24,295 --> 00:58:25,839
You took so long'

l told you l was
going for a long walk'

510
00:58:28,174 --> 00:58:30,635
How's your stomach now?

Where's Tiger?
- Tiger''Tiger is here'

512
00:58:36,307 --> 00:58:43,356
Tiger, disgusting!''' How often
have l told you not to shit at home!

513
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:47,527
Come soon' l'll be laying the
table, the food will get cold'

514
00:58:47,777 --> 00:58:48,778
Yes'

515
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,632
Will you just keep laughing?
Give her some tea too!

516
00:59:10,091 --> 00:59:13,386
Why didn't you come to Switerland?
- Yes, why?

517
00:59:13,845 --> 00:59:17,390
lf l knew you were also going,
l'd have never cancelled my plans'

518
00:59:18,016 --> 00:59:20,602
So what if you
haven't seen Switerland?

519
00:59:21,144 --> 00:59:23,188
l'll show you Switerland
through my video camera'

520
00:59:23,396 --> 00:59:24,397
Go on'

521
00:59:24,606 --> 00:59:28,401
My son has shot so well' He was
with the camera all day long'

522
00:59:30,028 --> 00:59:31,946
My son is very smart!

523
00:59:32,405 --> 00:59:33,281
Look'

524
00:59:34,908 --> 00:59:37,619
Hey! This is very nice!
- lt's a fantastic hotel!

525
00:59:38,036 --> 00:59:39,537
l should have gone!

526
00:59:42,165 --> 00:59:44,209
Prem is going to the swimming pool!

527
00:59:45,251 --> 00:59:46,836
Pillu, where did she come from?

528
01:00:19,828 --> 01:00:23,123
Now, l understand that he didn't
go to Switerland for business'''

529
01:00:23,415 --> 01:00:25,959
''' but to make merry
with this bitch!

530
01:00:27,877 --> 01:00:31,464
You fool, come here!
l'll thrash you!

531
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,800
Why are you beating him?
lt's not his fault'

532
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:35,051
Sit down!

533
01:00:35,593 --> 01:00:41,016
lt's my son's fault' My son
did shoot Rupali embracing Prem'

534
01:00:41,516 --> 01:00:45,353
But he did not shoot Prem
untangling her arms and scolding her'

535
01:00:46,021 --> 01:00:47,022
Meaning?

536
01:00:47,272 --> 01:00:49,733
We were right there' Prem does
not even know that girl'

537
01:00:50,108 --> 01:00:51,818
But, daddy,'''
- Shut up!

538
01:00:51,985 --> 01:00:55,780
This is true' ln fact, l had
introduced her to Brother Prem'

539
01:00:56,489 --> 01:01:02,245
She's a modern girl, and it's no big
deal for such girls to get physical'

540
01:01:04,164 --> 01:01:05,707
Where are you going?
- Home'

541
01:01:05,874 --> 01:01:08,335
At least, eat breakfast and go'
- l'm full, looking at the cassette!

542
01:01:09,586 --> 01:01:10,587
Please listen'

543
01:01:11,254 --> 01:01:13,506
Sorry, son'
l hope you aren't hurt'

544
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:18,928
Take this and shoot me' l have
to put on such an act sometimes'

545
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:35,153
Pooja, had this hit me,
you would have become a widow!

546
01:01:36,446 --> 01:01:40,575
No! lf you die of an electric
shock, then l'll become a widow'

547
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:42,577
Please keep that down'

548
01:01:45,038 --> 01:01:48,875
Did you go there on business
or to make merry with that bitch?

549
01:01:49,209 --> 01:01:50,835
First, relax!

550
01:01:51,711 --> 01:01:53,755
l went there to make merry?

551
01:01:57,342 --> 01:02:00,637
l was taking you there'
Who booked your tickets?

552
01:02:02,472 --> 01:02:04,099
Who cancelled them?

553
01:02:04,641 --> 01:02:06,685
Why? Because we would
spend 1 '2 million'

554
01:02:07,394 --> 01:02:11,064
So be it! At least, l wouldn't
have had to see such a day!

555
01:02:12,607 --> 01:02:16,820
We were together for a few days,
and spent some time together'

556
01:02:17,362 --> 01:02:21,491
What! Did you stay together?!
- O' my dear baby!

557
01:02:22,534 --> 01:02:26,663
Staying together means staying
in the same hotel, not the same room!

558
01:02:27,789 --> 01:02:33,503
Lakhan and Lovely too were there'
You asked them, didn't you?

559
01:02:34,045 --> 01:02:35,880
What did they say?

560
01:02:37,048 --> 01:02:41,094
That there was nothing'
And yet, you suspect me!

561
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:46,933
Have l ever lied to you,
ever deceived you?

562
01:02:50,687 --> 01:02:55,692
You don't believe me,
you are suspicious of me''' Fine!

563
01:02:56,276 --> 01:02:59,612
No! l believe you!

564
01:03:00,071 --> 01:03:03,199
O' God!
l suspected my husband!

565
01:03:03,867 --> 01:03:09,998
Please forgive me!
l made a big mistake!

566
01:03:10,957 --> 01:03:12,584
No!
- Forgive me'

567
01:03:13,043 --> 01:03:15,503
Please don't cry'

568
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:21,968
l loved you, l still do,
and will always do so'

569
01:03:23,053 --> 01:03:25,847
l know that'

570
01:03:26,181 --> 01:03:27,682
Stop crying'

571
01:03:38,693 --> 01:03:40,111
Drink this'

572
01:03:41,571 --> 01:03:45,950
Keep it here' Sit down'
l want to talk to you'

573
01:03:47,035 --> 01:03:50,622
l have considered you to be more
a daughter than a daughter-in-law'

574
01:03:51,206 --> 01:03:54,292
l want to tell you about
the temperament of men'

575
01:03:55,543 --> 01:03:59,005
A man wants to see
his wife like his lover'

576
01:03:59,547 --> 01:04:01,591
You used to be so different
before marriage!

577
01:04:02,092 --> 01:04:04,344
What a vast change
between then and now!

578
01:04:05,303 --> 01:04:07,347
Have you ever given this a thought?

579
01:04:08,431 --> 01:04:10,350
No, never'

580
01:04:10,809 --> 01:04:13,061
Because you don't have
the time to think!

581
01:04:14,145 --> 01:04:16,940
You have got so involved
with your home and children'

582
01:04:17,357 --> 01:04:22,445
lf you become a lover, your husband
will have all his attention on you'

583
01:04:22,737 --> 01:04:23,738
Understand?

584
01:10:37,862 --> 01:10:39,906
Listen'
- Yes, my baby?

585
01:10:40,365 --> 01:10:42,325
lt's 'Karwa-chauth' today'
- So?

586
01:10:42,575 --> 01:10:46,871
Forgotten? Once l sight the moon,
l'll see your face and only then eat'

587
01:10:47,247 --> 01:10:48,748
So come home early'

588
01:10:48,998 --> 01:10:52,419
Okay, my baby' l'll be there
before you can sight the moon!

589
01:11:00,969 --> 01:11:03,513
Who's that?
- Rupali speaking! Who else?

590
01:11:03,763 --> 01:11:04,889
Yes, baby?

591
01:11:05,056 --> 01:11:07,225
Waiting for somebody else's call?
- No'

592
01:11:09,352 --> 01:11:13,231
Prem, l'm fasting for
the first time today'

593
01:11:13,773 --> 01:11:16,651
Come soon before the moon can be
sighted' You'll come, won't you?

594
01:11:17,027 --> 01:11:20,572
Okay, my baby' l'll be there
before you can sight the moon!

595
01:11:23,116 --> 01:11:25,577
Take care'
l'll speak to you later'

596
01:11:29,414 --> 01:11:31,750
l think this moon is going
to be eclipsed today!

597
01:11:34,794 --> 01:11:37,255
Eat this'
- No!

598
01:11:43,636 --> 01:11:44,971
Yes, Shashi?

599
01:11:49,434 --> 01:11:51,061
How much?''' 35 million!

600

Today?'''
No, Shashi, not today'

602
01:12:01,363 --> 01:12:03,323
She is returning tomorrow morning?

603
01:12:04,407 --> 01:12:07,494
Fine, let her go'
What can we do?

604
01:12:08,578 --> 01:12:10,205
l'll bear a loss of 35 million'

605
01:12:11,915 --> 01:12:15,251
There's no chance today'
My wife is fasting today!

606
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:19,381
How will an American
know about lndian culture?

607
01:12:19,923 --> 01:12:21,049
Come on, eat'

608
01:12:21,299 --> 01:12:24,177
But you're an lndian, right? Don't
you know what 'Karwa-chauth' is?

609
01:12:25,095 --> 01:12:27,305
How our wives
starve and fast for us!

610
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:32,143
Don't phone again!

611
01:12:34,646 --> 01:12:36,481
What's wrong?
- What's wrong with you?

612
01:12:36,731 --> 01:12:39,109
Nothing'
- You mentioned over the phone that'''

613

if you don't attend the meeting,
you'll suffer a loss of 35 million'

Yes, l'll incur
a loss of 35 million'

615
01:12:46,533 --> 01:12:50,745
ls 35 million more
important than you?

616
01:12:51,413 --> 01:12:52,789
No, but'''
- Then?

617
01:12:52,997 --> 01:12:55,458
But don't incur any losses'
Please go and attend the meeting'

618
01:12:57,335 --> 01:13:02,549
Look, you're fasting today' l'm not

l've stayed hungry all day long'

620

l told you, l would be here,
before you could sight the moon!

You look stunning!
But why are you so pale?

629
01:14:10,867 --> 01:14:13,119
l'm famished!
- Famished?

630
01:14:13,453 --> 01:14:14,454
Yes'

631
01:14:14,746 --> 01:14:16,081
The moon'''

''' it's 8 O'clock,'''
but it's still not to be seen!

timings in different places!

Tiger, what are you doing?
What's the matter?

01:14:50,949 --> 01:14:53,284
Where are you taking me?

Where have you brought me?

643
01:15:02,711 --> 01:15:04,754
There's your moon!
- Really?

Now what?
- Now, take this''' go on!

Pooja, l'''
- Stop it!

Until now, a husband kept lying,

01:16:34,469 --> 01:16:37,555
But now, l have witnessed
that trust getting betrayed!

l want to explain
to you that'''

653
01:16:41,476 --> 01:16:44,562
This is no time to explain,
but a time to reach a decision!

Do you want a family and a home'''

655

or a mistress and that house?
- What is your implication?

656

A wife can tolerate sharing anything,
but not her husband'

Why did you stop? Slap me!

660
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:19,806
What can be a worse slap for a wife
than her husband bringing a mistress?

661
01:17:20,348 --> 01:17:22,726
What are you doing?
The children are listening'

662
01:17:23,018 --> 01:17:27,188
lt's good! Let them also know
what their father has been up to!

663
01:17:29,524 --> 01:17:34,487
l am starving here and praying
for your long life, while you'''

664
01:17:34,946 --> 01:17:36,990
Let's go inside and talk'

665
01:17:37,574 --> 01:17:40,952
No, mother! A decision
will be made today!

666
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:46,374
This is the
line of demarcation'

667
01:17:47,459 --> 01:17:50,462
He will have to
swear by his children'''

668
01:17:51,004 --> 01:17:56,468
''' that he can get that woman
out of his heart, mind and life!

669
01:17:56,843 --> 01:17:58,595
Only then can he enter
the house, or'''

670
01:17:58,803 --> 01:18:01,389
Or? Or what?!

671
01:18:01,848 --> 01:18:08,063
Or the man who has an affair with
some other woman, is not my husband!

672
01:18:09,814 --> 01:18:13,485
And l don't have a place
in my home for a stranger!

673
01:18:20,241 --> 01:18:21,242
Fine!

674
01:19:04,619 --> 01:19:07,497
l have come to you'''
forever and ever!

675
01:19:08,081 --> 01:19:09,457
Really!
- Yes'

676
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:11,876
Wow! My baby!

677
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:17,424
Come on, Rinku and Pinky'
Come and eat'

678
01:19:17,674 --> 01:19:19,384
ln a moment, mummy'

679
01:19:23,388 --> 01:19:24,389
Come on'

680
01:19:26,516 --> 01:19:27,934
Good-day!

681
01:19:32,313 --> 01:19:35,650
What's this l hear? Prem has
left this house to stay with Rupali!

682
01:19:37,986 --> 01:19:39,821
Please don't be dejected'

683
01:19:40,447 --> 01:19:45,243
When a bird leaves its nest,
it may go astray,'''

684
01:19:45,702 --> 01:19:47,620
''' but eventually,
it does return to its nest'

685
01:19:47,787 --> 01:19:50,040
What rot are you talking!

686
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:52,959
lt's 'Diwali' two days later' He
will surely come to meet the children'

687
01:19:56,546 --> 01:19:58,798
The other day, you
covered up for his misdeeds'

688
01:20:00,383 --> 01:20:03,803
lf you had revealed the truth
and not stood by him,'''

689
01:20:04,054 --> 01:20:06,765
''' the matter would have
ended there and then'

690
01:20:07,015 --> 01:20:08,933
Well, l'''
- All men are alike!

691
01:20:09,267 --> 01:20:11,102
Hey! What are you doing!
- You did the right thing'

692
01:20:11,353 --> 01:20:13,938
l am deeply ashamed of
what l did the other day'

693
01:20:14,397 --> 01:20:18,068
l stood by him, thinking it
to be the follies of youth'

694
01:20:18,443 --> 01:20:20,487
How was l to know that matters
would deteriorate to this extent!

695
01:20:20,737 --> 01:20:22,572
The rascal left home!

696
01:20:22,822 --> 01:20:27,494
Yet, if you feel that Prem
left home because of me,'''

697
01:20:28,036 --> 01:20:30,538
''' then l shall bring him back'
This is a brother's promise!

698
01:20:36,002 --> 01:20:37,796
Don't you care
about your honour?

699
01:20:38,046 --> 01:20:41,341
l do! But she is not at all
concerned about my honour!

700
01:20:42,008 --> 01:20:43,635
Who doesn't make mistakes?

701
01:20:43,885 --> 01:20:46,346
l made a blunder, l apologised,
but she didn't let me come home!

702
01:20:46,805 --> 01:20:49,182
l told her to think about the effect
it would have on the children'

703
01:20:49,724 --> 01:20:52,727
She said that even they ought to
know what their father was up to'''

704
01:20:53,061 --> 01:20:55,522
Who is responsible
for this?! ''' You are!

705
01:20:56,690 --> 01:20:58,733
There is no woman
in this world'''

706
01:20:59,109 --> 01:21:01,778
''' who can bear to see her husband
in the arms of another woman!

707
01:21:02,445 --> 01:21:05,115
Your wife did the same too'
But this does not mean'''

708
01:21:05,573 --> 01:21:08,493
you leave your home and family!

709
01:21:08,993 --> 01:21:13,707
l am her husband, l have married
her! l am with her 24 hours a day!

710
01:21:14,332 --> 01:21:16,292
And if l spend 30 minutes talking
to someone else, should she '''

711
01:21:16,501 --> 01:21:18,545
''' conveniently forget the 23
hours and 30 minutes spent with her?

712
01:21:19,004 --> 01:21:21,589
She has gone cray!
- She hasn't, you have!

713
01:21:22,257 --> 01:21:25,552
Are you nuts, Prem?!
What nonsense are you talking!

714
01:21:26,428 --> 01:21:28,888
l'm your friend'
Let's go home'

715
01:21:29,556 --> 01:21:31,391
Why should l come?!

716
01:21:31,641 --> 01:21:33,685
l haven't left home, she has
thrown me out of the house!

717
01:21:33,935 --> 01:21:36,604
She says that l'm not her husband'
Fine! l'm very happy with Rupali!

718
01:21:37,022 --> 01:21:39,941
Wait for some days, and she
will realise what a husband means!

719
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,486
No! You will realise
what a wife means!

720
01:21:44,154 --> 01:21:45,989
What a home and children mean!

721
01:21:46,322 --> 01:21:49,909
And the day it dawns on you,
you will deeply regret!

722
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:52,704
lf this is being regretful,
then l'm very happy this way!

723
01:21:53,079 --> 01:21:55,582
And listen! Whose friend
are you? Mine or hers?

724
01:21:56,666 --> 01:21:58,710
He has no mistress, so he talks rot!

725
01:27:28,623 --> 01:27:31,126
Everybody is bursting crackers,
allow us to also do so'

726
01:27:31,376 --> 01:27:32,377
Yes, mummy'

727
01:27:32,585 --> 01:27:35,922
Your papa will come just now
with plenry of crackers'

728
01:27:36,381 --> 01:27:38,633
We will then burst
them together, okay?

729
01:27:43,888 --> 01:27:45,390
Papa is here!

730
01:27:45,974 --> 01:27:48,018
Papa is here!

731
01:27:48,476 --> 01:27:51,146
lt's Uncle Lakhan here, not papa'
Look, what l've brought for you!

732
01:27:53,314 --> 01:27:55,859
Go and burst them'
- Careful! Don't burn your hands!

733
01:27:56,401 --> 01:27:58,445
Don't worry, they aren't bombs'

734
01:28:00,030 --> 01:28:01,573
Happy Diwali!
- Same to you'

735
01:28:01,823 --> 01:28:03,658
Blessings, mother'
- Happy Diwali!

736
01:28:03,908 --> 01:28:05,326
Happy Diwali!

737
01:28:05,744 --> 01:28:07,412
Happy Diwali!
- Bless you, dear'

738
01:28:07,662 --> 01:28:08,872
Brother Lakhan'

739
01:28:10,415 --> 01:28:13,043
You had said that he'd definitely
come to meet the kids for Diwali'

740
01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:18,840
lf he does not come to meet the kids
on Diwali, then it is his misfortune!

741
01:28:19,758 --> 01:28:23,011
The goddess of the house is at home,
on such an auspicious day!

742
01:28:23,595 --> 01:28:26,598
You are so sensible'
Why don't you explain to her?

743
01:28:26,973 --> 01:28:29,309
What do l do? She just
refuses to understand'

744
01:28:30,810 --> 01:28:32,228
The children are so happy!

745
01:28:32,395 --> 01:28:33,688
Rinku, careful!

746
01:28:35,106 --> 01:28:37,025
Did you meet him?

747
01:28:38,109 --> 01:28:42,238
Yes, but right now, Rupali seems to
have intoxicated him a bit too much!

748
01:28:42,697 --> 01:28:46,034
However intoxicated a man may be,
he does become sober someday!

749
01:28:46,534 --> 01:28:47,869
Please sit'

750
01:28:48,536 --> 01:28:52,665
A woman is so powerful that a
man stands no chance before her!

751
01:28:53,249 --> 01:28:55,502
lf she makes up her mind,
then nothing is impossible'

752
01:28:55,835 --> 01:28:56,836
Meaning?

753
01:28:57,212 --> 01:28:59,255
l'll give her some advice,
but don't you use it on me!

754
01:28:59,506 --> 01:29:03,093
A wife has so many weapons'''

755
01:29:03,551 --> 01:29:06,888
'''that if she uses them against her
husband, he'll be blown to pieces!

756
01:29:08,348 --> 01:29:09,349
Like?

757
01:29:09,599 --> 01:29:12,477
Your first weapon
would be your children'

758
01:29:19,818 --> 01:29:21,236
Coming, damn it!

759
01:29:26,157 --> 01:29:28,952
Why did you ring the bell?
- To call you'

760
01:29:29,285 --> 01:29:31,246
To have the door opened'

761
01:29:32,330 --> 01:29:33,331
Hey!

762
01:29:35,041 --> 01:29:36,876
Where are you barging inside?

763
01:29:40,672 --> 01:29:42,716
Where is he?!
- Who?

764
01:29:43,091 --> 01:29:45,010
Your slave!
- Who's speaking!

765
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:47,929
You ask me the question
which l should be asking you!

766
01:29:48,179 --> 01:29:50,015
Where is he?
Hiding behind you?!

767
01:29:51,725 --> 01:29:55,020
You are a wrong number, l'm the
right number! Go and call him!

768
01:30:05,113 --> 01:30:06,698
How are you?

769
01:30:09,367 --> 01:30:11,286
Rupali, these are my children'

770
01:30:12,996 --> 01:30:13,997
Greet her'

771
01:30:17,167 --> 01:30:21,004
A lady is abusing me over the phone'
Would you like to listen to her?

772
01:30:21,338 --> 01:30:23,381
Yes'
- Children, please sit here'

773
01:30:28,636 --> 01:30:30,472
Have the children reached?

774
01:30:30,805 --> 01:30:33,808
Yes, Pooja' This is some joke!
Why have you sent them here?

775
01:30:34,059 --> 01:30:36,811
Will l send them to the
neighbour's house if not yours?!

776
01:30:37,479 --> 01:30:39,773
You are their father'
Take care of them'

777
01:30:40,190 --> 01:30:42,359
l have nothing to do
with them now' Understand?

778
01:30:42,609 --> 01:30:44,652
Hello! Pooja, listen to me!

779
01:30:46,363 --> 01:30:48,198
She kept the receiver down!

780
01:30:49,282 --> 01:30:50,992
Give it'
- Take'

781
01:30:51,576 --> 01:30:54,037
From now on, these children
will stay here, won't they?

782
01:31:16,935 --> 01:31:19,688
Mummy, aunry has gone
to sleep in papa's room'

783
01:31:20,271 --> 01:31:21,272
Really?

784
01:31:22,399 --> 01:31:24,901
Son, you cannot sleep
without father, right?

785
01:31:25,985 --> 01:31:28,863
And remember, don't let
papa sleep with that bitch'

786
01:31:29,739 --> 01:31:33,660
You know what to do, don't you?
- Yes, we do'

787
01:31:51,011 --> 01:31:53,054
Hey! l wonder where he's gone!

788
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:10,780
Hey! Why are you coming here?!

789
01:32:13,324 --> 01:32:14,743
What are you doing here?

790
01:32:15,827 --> 01:32:19,956
We were getting very scared in
the room, so we'll sleep with you'

791
01:32:20,206 --> 01:32:21,207
Fine'

792
01:32:22,125 --> 01:32:23,293
Fine?!

793
01:32:29,674 --> 01:32:31,634
You have infuriated her'

794
01:32:32,344 --> 01:32:35,597
Are you concerned only
about her, not about us?

795
01:32:38,558 --> 01:32:40,393
That's not so'

796
01:32:41,144 --> 01:32:42,896
Come and sleep'

Are you taking me to
the gallows?! Please forgive me!

But generally, you eat and come'
- Shut up and listen!

01:35:19,636 --> 01:35:24,224
Yesterday, when l asked aunt for
something to eat, she scolded me'

829
01:35:24,766 --> 01:35:29,729
And when l broke her plate,
she raised her hand to slap me'

830
01:35:30,105 --> 01:35:32,023
What! Did she slap you?

831
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:35,151
No' Papa came in then,
and scolded her a lot'

832
01:35:35,485 --> 01:35:38,697
Really? Did he scold her?
- Yes, mummy'

833
01:35:40,824 --> 01:35:44,536
He has a place in his heart,
at least for the kids if not for me'

834
01:35:47,997 --> 01:35:53,586
This is great news that
the rascal Prem scolded Rupali'

835
01:35:54,087 --> 01:35:56,756
Why are you worried then?
You ought to be happy!

836
01:35:57,173 --> 01:36:00,260
Fortunately, he happened to reach
there and save the children'

837
01:36:01,261 --> 01:36:04,973
lf she ever hits them when she's
alone, then who will save them?

838
01:36:05,557 --> 01:36:10,311
Yes, who will save them?

839
01:36:11,187 --> 01:36:13,732
Yes! Your second weapon!

840
01:36:14,274 --> 01:36:17,694
Second weapon?
- Your mother-in-law!

841
01:36:18,987 --> 01:36:20,822
That's more like it!

842
01:36:27,162 --> 01:36:29,205
Hey, mother! You here?

843
01:36:29,831 --> 01:36:31,875
What do l say, son?

844
01:36:32,542 --> 01:36:34,586
My daughter-in-law'''
l can't call her that!

845
01:36:34,836 --> 01:36:37,297
Pooja has thrown me
out of the house!

846
01:36:37,756 --> 01:36:41,468
She said, ''Old hag, when your son
isn't living here, why are you?''

847
01:36:42,344 --> 01:36:46,890
Look at what she
has done to Tiger too!

848
01:36:47,557 --> 01:36:51,269
She didn't even let me take my
clothes' Look, l've worn an old sari!

849
01:36:51,811 --> 01:36:54,189
l never thought Pooja
could stoop so low!

850
01:36:55,315 --> 01:36:59,402
One never knows
who can stoop, and when!

851
01:37:00,695 --> 01:37:02,739
Give me some money'

852
01:37:03,156 --> 01:37:06,493
l'll go to the home for the aged'
- No, mother, you will stay with me'

853
01:37:06,951 --> 01:37:10,372
Grandma is here!
- Hey!''' My children!

854
01:37:10,622 --> 01:37:11,915
Grandma is here!

855
01:37:13,208 --> 01:37:15,043
You will stay
with us, won't you?

856
01:37:15,418 --> 01:37:19,214
Yes' Where else will l go?
l'll stay right here'

857
01:37:23,134 --> 01:37:26,721
Rupali, she is my mother'
From now on, she'll stay here'

858
01:37:29,182 --> 01:37:31,643
And you need Tiger
to protect you'

859
01:37:35,021 --> 01:37:39,651
Hey, she is so snoory!
You left Pooja for her?!

860
01:37:40,235 --> 01:37:42,153
My Pooja is thousand times
better than her'

861
01:37:42,404 --> 01:37:44,239
You've already started
speaking ill about her!

862
01:37:44,489 --> 01:37:47,575
lt doesn't matter to me'
ln your happiness, lies mine too'

863
01:37:48,118 --> 01:37:52,163
l will be, where you are' You may
stay with Pooja or with this snob'

864
01:37:52,622 --> 01:37:55,917
Just show me the room
where l can remain in one corner'

865
01:37:56,459 --> 01:37:59,504
l am your son,
not your daughter-in-law!

866
01:38:00,088 --> 01:38:02,382
Thank God!
- l'll take care of you' Come with me

867
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:05,677
l'll show you your room'

868
01:38:05,844 --> 01:38:10,098
lf a patient doesn't heed his
doctor, how can the ailment be cured?

869
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:13,435
lt was fine to send
the children and mother'

870
01:38:14,102 --> 01:38:17,313
But me going to office
''' that's impossible!

871
01:38:17,856 --> 01:38:20,942
lf lndira Gandhi could run a
country in spite of being a woman,'''

872
01:38:21,401 --> 01:38:24,070
''' then, can't you run
an office for a few days?

873
01:38:25,155 --> 01:38:28,783
You forget that Prem holds
490/0 of the company shares,'''

874
01:38:29,325 --> 01:38:33,038
''' while you hold 510/0!
So, who is the proprietor?''' You!

875
01:38:33,496 --> 01:38:36,124
l'd say, don't sit at home
and fight this battle'

876
01:38:36,624 --> 01:38:40,253
Declare war! Just tell Rupali!
That will be the end of the matter!

877
01:38:40,795 --> 01:38:43,256
Do you know l had even
scolded her over the phone?!

878
01:38:43,923 --> 01:38:46,718
Not over the phone,
my innocent sister-in-law!

879
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:55,560
Just bump into her, and tell her
that you are the wife - Numero Uno!

880
01:39:06,446 --> 01:39:09,532
Hey! Can't you see and open the
door? You broke my lovely house!

881
01:39:12,494 --> 01:39:17,665
This was only a glass house, and
you're so pained to see it break'

882
01:39:19,167 --> 01:39:23,046
Just think! You have broken apart
my lovely, well-settled home'

883
01:39:24,589 --> 01:39:26,257
How pained l must be!

884
01:39:29,594 --> 01:39:33,098
l did not break your home'
Prem came to me on his own'

885
01:39:33,973 --> 01:39:35,809
Because he loves me, Pooja'

886
01:39:40,188 --> 01:39:44,359
You are sadly mistaken!
l'm the only one he loves'

887
01:39:47,237 --> 01:39:51,199
lf your love was so strong, then you
could have stopped him earlier too'

888
01:39:53,243 --> 01:39:56,246
You are right'

889
01:39:57,956 --> 01:40:02,210
So now, if your love is so strong,
then stop him and show!

890
01:40:04,212 --> 01:40:06,256
lt's very easy to be a lover'

891
01:40:07,340 --> 01:40:09,801
But it's equally difficult
to be a wife!

892
01:40:10,885 --> 01:40:15,015
You love him very much, don't you?
Then, love his mother too!

893
01:40:17,183 --> 01:40:19,227
As well as his children!

894
01:40:20,061 --> 01:40:22,105
And his dog too!

895
01:40:23,898 --> 01:40:28,570
From now on, l will live your life,
and you will live mine!

896
01:40:38,038 --> 01:40:40,665
Hey, Sharma, file this paper!
Why are you showing it to me?

897
01:40:41,833 --> 01:40:43,793
Hello, sister-in-law' You?!

898
01:40:44,586 --> 01:40:49,632
Not sister-in-law! Get used to
calling me madam or Mrs'Pooja Mehra'

899
01:40:50,592 --> 01:40:52,635
But, madam, what brings you
to the office today?

900
01:40:53,011 --> 01:40:56,848
l should have done this earlier'
But l couldn't pay any attention'''

901
01:40:57,390 --> 01:40:59,434
''' to the office as l
was busy with household chores'

902
01:41:01,978 --> 01:41:04,314
What am l in this company?
- A partner, madam'

903
01:41:04,689 --> 01:41:06,733
How much percent?
- 510/0'

904
01:41:07,567 --> 01:41:09,486
And what about your boss?
- 490/0'

905
01:41:10,028 --> 01:41:12,614
So, how many percent
more loyal should you be to me?

906
01:41:13,031 --> 01:41:14,240
20/0, madam'

907
01:41:18,244 --> 01:41:19,579
What else is happening here?

908
01:41:19,788 --> 01:41:21,998
Everything is a big
mess here, madam!

909
01:41:22,415 --> 01:41:25,502
The boss must not have spent as much
for his wedding as he has, on her!

910
01:41:26,169 --> 01:41:30,215
We are losing all our clients,
and he refuses to change his model!

911
01:41:32,217 --> 01:41:33,635
ls there any shooting today?
- Yes, madam'

912
01:41:33,927 --> 01:41:35,929
Where?
- At Famous Studio'

913
01:42:08,336 --> 01:42:11,297
What's wrong with the generator?
- Why have the lights gone off?

914
01:42:11,798 --> 01:42:13,466
Check the generator'
Why have the lights gone off?

915
01:42:13,758 --> 01:42:18,096
The generator is perfectly fine,
but the shooting has been cancelled'

916
01:42:18,555 --> 01:42:21,891
At whose behest?
- Well''' Madam Pooja''' you'''

917
01:42:22,308 --> 01:42:24,644
As far as l remember, this company
belongs to Prem, doesn't it?

918
01:42:25,061 --> 01:42:29,524
Yes' But Mr'Prem holds
only 490/0 of the shares'''

919
01:42:30,025 --> 01:42:32,861
''' whereas Madam Pooja
holds 510/0'

920
01:42:33,319 --> 01:42:36,740
Well, l cannot disobey her' Do you
understand what l'm trying to say'''

921
01:42:37,490 --> 01:42:39,868
This is a big problem!
- Such humiliation, huh?!

922
01:42:44,581 --> 01:42:47,042
There's a lot of confusion in this
company! What will happen to me!

923
01:43:08,021 --> 01:43:09,606
What! Pooja cancelled
the shooting?

924
01:43:09,856 --> 01:43:11,858
Yes, sir' Madam had
even come to office'

925
01:43:12,108 --> 01:43:13,943
When?
- This morning, sir'

926
01:43:15,028 --> 01:43:16,029
She's nuts!

927
01:43:16,279 --> 01:43:19,824
Sir, do not forget that she holds
510/0 of the company shares'

928
01:43:20,325 --> 01:43:22,285
Hey, l'm responsible for that!

929
01:43:22,577 --> 01:43:24,371
As per the rules,
if you challenge her,'''

930
01:43:24,621 --> 01:43:27,165
''' she will lock this company,
and we'll be left nowhere!

931
01:43:27,540 --> 01:43:29,584
She can do that'
- Just think'

932
01:43:31,086 --> 01:43:32,504
Madam is here'

933
01:43:36,341 --> 01:43:38,385
l have never ever
been so insulted!

934
01:43:39,010 --> 01:43:41,596
A shooting that was on,
was cancelled, and l was told'''

935
01:43:42,138 --> 01:43:46,601
''' your Rupali was told that
she isn't this company's model!

936
01:43:47,143 --> 01:43:49,187
Who said so?
- He did!

937
01:43:55,652 --> 01:43:56,695
That's it?

938
01:43:57,153 --> 01:44:01,366
Hey, he didn't have the
shooting cancelled, Pooja did'

939
01:44:02,492 --> 01:44:04,536
She is envious of you'

940
01:44:05,078 --> 01:44:07,330
These eyes, this face'''

941
01:44:08,623 --> 01:44:10,875

There is no
such model in lndia!

Really?

944

Move aside!

947
01:46:22,048 --> 01:46:24,426
What impudence is this!
- l'm sorry' l'm not being impudent'

948
01:46:24,801 --> 01:46:26,428
My name is Balwinder Singh'
- So?

What's wrong?
You seem very livid'

974
01:48:04,401 --> 01:48:07,987

But you are screaming aloud!

When did you come?

994
01:50:40,306 --> 01:50:45,311
So much has transpired,
and you didn't even inform us!

995
01:50:46,521 --> 01:50:52,527
Didn't you consider your parents
worthy of sharing your sorrows?

996
01:51:05,707 --> 01:51:09,627
How often did we explain to you
that Prem was not worthy of you'

997
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:13,381
But you always
thought us to be wrong'

998
01:51:14,674 --> 01:51:18,261
Anyway, don't worry'
Your parents are still alive'

1002
01:51:31,858 --> 01:51:34,861
ln spite of the fact
that Prem has left you?

Mother! What are you doing?
- Cleaning the house, son'

1013
01:53:00,405 --> 01:53:02,699
l can see that,
but where are the servants?

1014
01:53:03,116 --> 01:53:06,953
Rupali says that if we want to stay
here, we should work & earn our food'

1015
01:53:08,288 --> 01:53:11,124
She makes everybody work'
She even makes us wash clothes'

1016
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:15,253
Why didn't you tell me, mother?
- Matters would unnecessarily worsen'

Hey! l've never
asked anyone to work'

1024
01:53:40,445 --> 01:53:42,489
Will they lie to me then?

1025

l've just seen poor mother
mopping the floor'

But l'm the only one you scold!

So what if she works a little!

Don't cry'

Now what? Why are you sitting out?

Who is she to drive us away from
the house that belongs to you?

Move out of my way!

Rupali asked me to take these pills
so that l'd feel relieved forever'

What! Did Rupali
give you these pills?

Yes, son'
- This is rat poison!

02:06:19,120 --> 02:06:20,455
What nonsense is this!

1116

l know that you have always
hated my mother and children!

1117
02:06:23,291 --> 02:06:25,960
That is a lie!
- You're taking advantage of my love!

Mother, you'''
- Loving you was a big mistake!

1119
02:06:29,130 --> 02:06:32,217
Mistake? l made a mistake by
loving a contemptible man like you!

1120
02:06:37,472 --> 02:06:41,017
lt's crossed the limit today, Prem!
lt really has!

1121
02:06:54,948 --> 02:06:56,991
Really?''' This is great news!
- Sister-in-law!

You first!

1126
02:07:08,086 --> 02:07:11,840
Mother had called'
Prem slapped Rupali just now!

1127
02:07:12,298 --> 02:07:14,759
She has locked herself in a room'
She isn't even talking to Prem!

1128
02:07:15,010 --> 02:07:17,637
The rascal has done something
right for the first time!

1129
02:07:17,971 --> 02:07:20,015
Now, you tell me!
- Sit down first!

1130
02:07:20,724 --> 02:07:24,853
l've just learnt that a boy named
Deepak used to love Rupali a lot'

1131
02:07:25,353 --> 02:07:29,149
But Rupali wanted to marry a rich
man, so she jilted poor Deepak'

1132
02:07:30,650 --> 02:07:34,571
But of what use is Deepak to us?
- He is of great use!

1133
02:07:35,238 --> 02:07:40,452
Rupali is very emotionally insecure,
frustrated and depressed right now'

1134
02:07:40,994 --> 02:07:44,831
She needs a shoulder to cry on,
and the shoulder will be that of'''?

1135
02:07:45,248 --> 02:07:46,458
Deepak!

1136

l've understood everything
you have said'

1137
02:07:53,006 --> 02:07:56,676
But are you sure that Rupali will
be willing to leave your husband?

1138
02:07:57,052 --> 02:07:59,804
Right now, perhaps, she's filled
with remorse at what she's done'

1139
02:08:00,889 --> 02:08:04,392
lf you help us at this juncture,
then she can leave Prem'

- Brother'''

1141

Will you accept her then?

You haven't replied'

1143
02:08:17,572 --> 02:08:25,872
lf she comes to me, being sincerely
rueful, then l'll surely accept her'

Hey! You are
getting too emotional'

1145
02:08:37,384 --> 02:08:40,095
Your husband has been with
another woman for so long'

And if you are yet willing
to accept him, then so can l'

Let's go?''' Goodbye'

1152
02:09:00,323 --> 02:09:02,075
Rupali, tell me something'
- Yes?

1153
02:09:02,409 --> 02:09:05,161
Has Prem gone nuts?!
- Why? What's the matter?

1154
02:09:05,662 --> 02:09:11,167
l'd phoned Prem and asked for you'
lt's Lovely's birthday on Sunday'

1155
02:09:11,626 --> 02:09:13,586
l see'
- She wanted you also to come'

1156
02:09:13,962 --> 02:09:15,714
But Prem said that you wouldn't come'

1157
02:09:15,964 --> 02:09:19,592
l said, ''At least ask her!''
And he got angry!

1158
02:09:20,135 --> 02:09:23,096
He said, ''What's the need?
Rupali will do as l say!''

1159
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:26,141
As if you are his servant!'''
And he slammed the receiver down!

1160
02:09:26,725 --> 02:09:28,768
He slammed the receiver?!
He didn't even tell me!

1161
02:09:29,102 --> 02:09:31,146
Anyway, it's your personal matter'

1162
02:09:31,604 --> 02:09:35,358
However, if you would seek
Prem's permission and come,'''

1163
02:09:35,775 --> 02:09:37,527
''' Lovely would be very happy'

1164
02:09:37,861 --> 02:09:42,407
l have never sought permission
for anything! l will surely come!

1165
02:09:44,117 --> 02:09:45,952
At the dot of 4'30!

1166
02:09:47,245 --> 02:09:49,914
Prem, Rupali is a
very ill-mannered girl!

1167
02:09:50,373 --> 02:09:52,000
No way! What nonsense!

1168
02:09:52,876 --> 02:09:55,253
l had phoned you yesterday'
Rupali had answered the call'

1169
02:09:55,545 --> 02:09:59,716
l asked her where you were' She
said, how was she to know that!

1170
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:02,635
Did you tell her you were a friend?
- Yes'

1171
02:10:02,886 --> 02:10:05,972
l thought she didn't recognise my
voice' l said, this is Lakhan here'

1172
02:10:06,431 --> 02:10:07,432
And?

1173
02:10:07,599 --> 02:10:11,019
She said, ''So? Are you a Prime
Minister? Don't ever phone again!''

1174
02:10:11,311 --> 02:10:13,063
And she slammed the receiver!

1175
02:10:13,313 --> 02:10:15,065
Her audaciry! l'll''''!

1176
02:10:15,398 --> 02:10:18,068
Forget it! This is
your personal matter'

1177
02:10:19,402 --> 02:10:22,238
But, Prem, l'll never ever
come to your house again'

1178
02:10:22,697 --> 02:10:26,201
lf Rupali gives you the permission,
then come home at 5'30'

1179
02:10:26,701 --> 02:10:30,663
Permission! Will l have to seek
her permission to go to the bathroom?!

1180
02:10:31,539 --> 02:10:33,291
Do you think l'm henpecked?!
- No, it isn't so'''

Go ahead, but l don't think
you'll be able to come'

1183
02:10:39,339 --> 02:10:41,424
What nonsense are you talking!

Your father will come, won't he?

1188
02:10:56,648 --> 02:11:01,820
Both the parents have to attend the
function, and we also wish the same'

1189
02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:04,364
Your mummy will surely come'

And today,
we have become parents'

1196
02:11:56,624 --> 02:12:00,670
The bond of love between
parents and children'''

1197

What's this around your neck?
- A chain'

1211
02:20:20,587 --> 02:20:22,630
Oh! l thought it
was a 'mangalsutra''

1212
02:20:23,298 --> 02:20:26,384
This implies that Prem
has still not married you?

1213
02:20:29,637 --> 02:20:32,307
So, you are living together
out of wedlock''''?

1214
02:20:33,308 --> 02:20:36,811
Ms'Rupali, have you ever
thought of your future?!

1215
02:20:37,896 --> 02:20:41,816
A man who can leave his
wife and children for you'''

No'
- lt's my dury to guide you properly'

1219

Our sociery speaks filth about the
relationship that Prem and you share'

1220
02:21:05,006 --> 02:21:08,093
l can't even talk about it, but
you must have understood, right?

Ms'Rupali'
- Yes?

1229

But, Deepak,

And now, she has begun to
love you more than Pooja'

1247
02:23:10,131 --> 02:23:12,926
Very soon, she will
take Pooja's place!

1248
02:23:14,052 --> 02:23:16,971
No' Nobody can
take Pooja's place'

Then, go back to Pooja'
She still loves you very much'

No' There's too much
confusion in my life'

Lakhan, there's somebody here'
- lt's only Rupali'

Prem, look'''

1261

What did you say?
- Prem, don't get angry'

1263

Don't get angry,
and don't fight'

And you will not raise your hand!
- No, l won't raise my hand'

What are you doing?!
Have you gone cray?

l gave her a bungalow, a car'''
everything! How much l loved her!

1269
02:24:42,766 --> 02:24:45,393
And now, wearing a short skirt,
she sits glued to someone else!

1270
02:24:46,227 --> 02:24:49,981
You gave her everything'
Only then did she come to you!

1271
02:24:51,232 --> 02:24:55,987
You didn't think about your wife
who had left everything for you!

1272
02:25:04,829 --> 02:25:08,458
What l did to Pooja,
Rupali has done to me'

1273

But she is wrong!
l strike her off!

1274

Let's go, Prem'
You are my buddy, aren't you?

1275
02:25:16,633 --> 02:25:19,386
Did you think
you wouldn't get kicked?

1276
02:25:20,845 --> 02:25:22,889
Well, this was inevitable!

1277
02:25:24,933 --> 02:25:26,393
But why are you crying now?

1278
02:25:26,726 --> 02:25:28,895

Don't say anything else'

1288
02:26:11,062 --> 02:26:16,109
Just say,
''Pooja, l have come back'''

1289
02:26:17,193 --> 02:26:19,863
You won't go back
to her, will you?

1290
02:26:20,363 --> 02:26:24,492
Let alone her, l won't
go to anybody now!

1291
02:26:25,201 --> 02:26:26,953
You've forgiven me, haven't you?

1292
02:26:27,787 --> 02:26:33,418
lt's not your fault' A man
possesses the temperament of a dog!

1293
02:26:33,793 --> 02:26:35,295
How naive you are!

1294

You address me as Brother Lakhan,
and yet thank me!

A sister has settled down,
a friend has returned home'

1306

l've never touched anybody's feet,
but l will, today'

1308

Hey!

1309

A sister's place is not here,
but in the heart!

1310

O' God!

1311
02:27:54,916 --> 02:27:56,626

You ruined my life!
- Lovely, please listen to me!

1314
02:28:06,886 --> 02:28:09,764
Stop it! Lovely doesn't want
to listen to anything now!

Please slow down!
The car brakes have failed'

lt's you l am concerned about!
- Mummy, stop the car!

Your mummy is dead,
and so is your dad!

You've become an orphan,
and l, a widow!

1330

Why are you killing your husband
when he's yet alive?!

1331
02:29:44,734 --> 02:29:48,571
Listen to me! After we get
divorced, Pillu will stay with me!

So will I!
- I'll stay with both of you!

That's impossible
in this life, Pillu!

02:29:55,745 --> 02:29:57,580
Keep moving' Watch what l do'

1335
02:29:57,914 --> 02:30:01,960
Pillu, don't do anything stupid'
lf you do, then'''

She's my sister! ls it
wrong to hug a sister?

Brother Prem had lied to his wife.
Now, you are lying to me!

1345
02:30:31,197 --> 02:30:33,033
Papa, come inside!

Lovely, try to understand me'
Have I ever lied to you?

1353
02:31:24,459 --> 02:31:26,211
Yet, if you don't believe me, then

1354
02:31:26,378 --> 02:31:29,255
Prem, Pooja and Rupali
are at home. Ask them'

1355
02:31:29,631 --> 02:31:34,135
Why should l ask them? They are
outsiders, you are someone my own'

I trust you'

1357

O God! Please forgive me!

1358
02:31:38,973 --> 02:31:41,017
I really spoke ill,
in a fit of fury!

1359

Where are your feet?
I want to touch them

1360

They are in your hand, Lovely'
- Forgive me

Mummy, don't tell papa a thing'
- No, my son
